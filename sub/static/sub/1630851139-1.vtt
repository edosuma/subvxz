WEBVTT

01:33.534 --> 01:35.002
Whee!

01:44.211 --> 01:47.948
Hurray!
My first-ever overnight trip!

01:47.981 --> 01:50.485
And you're coming with me!

01:51.818 --> 01:55.422
I need that... and that...
and...

01:55.455 --> 01:58.025
Mom? Mom?

01:58.058 --> 02:01.729
Honey,
did I just hear a hurricane?

02:01.761 --> 02:06.534
You betcha!
Hurricane Conni is the house!

02:06.567 --> 02:08.601
Mom? Do you know where Mau is?

02:08.635 --> 02:11.639
Mau is down here, sweetheart.
Why?

02:11.671 --> 02:15.475
Mau! Where are you?

02:17.811 --> 02:21.047
She knows she's only going
away for a few days, right?

02:21.081 --> 02:24.218
What?! Huh?!

02:24.250 --> 02:26.920
- This is it, Dad.
- What in the world are...

02:26.954 --> 02:30.057
I just need...

02:34.628 --> 02:37.865
Hop! Hop!

02:37.897 --> 02:39.933
Whoa!

02:39.967 --> 02:42.702
Is that Mau? I heard him!

02:42.736 --> 02:45.206
- Oh dear! Conni, watch out!
- - Huh?

02:45.238 --> 02:47.741
- Watch out!
- Whoa!

02:47.773 --> 02:51.545
- Sweetheart!
- Whoa!

02:54.281 --> 02:58.586
There you are! Guess what?

02:58.618 --> 03:00.920
- Meow?
- We're going on a trip!

03:02.922 --> 03:08.729
Conni! There is a
cat lounging on your father's head

03:08.761 --> 03:10.931
and your father is NOT amused!

03:10.963 --> 03:12.699
Ooh...

03:16.670 --> 03:18.806
You're only going away
for three days

03:18.838 --> 03:23.176
to the lovely old castle with your
playschool group so one bag is enough.

03:23.210 --> 03:26.747
Your cuddle toy and a game for the
trip are going in the backpack.

03:26.779 --> 03:29.916
Mau is my cuddly toy!
Aren't you?!

03:31.784 --> 03:36.623
Mau is staying here, Conni.
You can't take animals with you.

03:36.657 --> 03:40.827
What?! Why not?
Nobody told me that!

03:40.861 --> 03:43.197
Did you ask?

03:43.230 --> 03:45.533
Oh.

03:45.565 --> 03:49.537
Are you ready guys? Time to go!

03:51.705 --> 03:53.541
You see? He wants to come!

03:57.743 --> 04:01.748
You have to pack
Teddy. He wants to come too!

04:13.593 --> 04:16.630
Oh Mau, you can't come.

04:18.097 --> 04:20.033
You have to stay.

04:22.101 --> 04:26.306
I'm gonna miss you so much.

04:33.347 --> 04:36.183
Hmm? Huh?

04:38.118 --> 04:41.021
Conni? We're waiting!

04:41.053 --> 04:45.159
I'm coming!
I just said goodbye to Mau.

04:45.191 --> 04:48.227
♪ I'm going on a vacation
and la la-la la... ♪

04:48.260 --> 04:51.030
- That backpack looks heavy, Conni.
- Huh? What?

04:51.063 --> 04:52.599
Shall I carry it?

04:52.633 --> 04:55.068
I can do it.

04:59.171 --> 05:00.640
Oh boy!

05:02.909 --> 05:06.813
I... I don't know! I don't know
how he got in the backpack, Dad.

05:06.847 --> 05:09.349
Honest, I really don't.

05:09.383 --> 05:13.787
Hmm...
Alright, young lady. Let's go.

05:13.820 --> 05:15.689
<

05:15.722 --> 05:17.358
Bye, Mau.

05:27.667 --> 05:30.269
Huh? Mau?

05:30.303 --> 05:34.408
Conni, come on!
And don't forget to close the front gate.

05:34.440 --> 05:38.044
Okay, Dad. I'm coming.

05:49.255 --> 05:52.392
Conni! Late again!

05:52.426 --> 05:56.363
Hi! Is everything okay?

05:56.395 --> 05:59.366
Um... yeah, everything's great!

05:59.399 --> 06:01.936
I can't wait to see the castle!

06:11.945 --> 06:13.981
Okay, kids! We have a visitor
from the city.

06:14.013 --> 06:18.686
He'll be joining us for a few
weeks on a work experience trip.

06:18.719 --> 06:23.290
Some of you might remember him.
Everyone say hello to Lennart.

06:25.825 --> 06:28.028
Hello, Lennart!

06:33.734 --> 06:36.736
Nice to meet you all!

06:36.770 --> 06:38.137
Huh?!

06:38.171 --> 06:40.741
I'm looking forward
to our trip to the country

06:40.774 --> 06:42.843
even if I am a city boy
at heart!

06:42.875 --> 06:45.979
Ooh!

06:51.383 --> 06:54.287
I guess it's all
in the technique!

07:38.298 --> 07:40.500
Okay, kids. All aboard please!

07:40.534 --> 07:42.969
We're leaving.
Say goodbye to your parents.

07:55.048 --> 07:57.317
Anything else to go in the hold?

08:12.399 --> 08:14.868
This is going to be so much fun!

08:16.902 --> 08:18.806
It's just a few days...

08:19.940 --> 08:23.510
see you soon!
And enjoy your holidays!

08:23.542 --> 08:25.511
Take care of Mau!

08:29.616 --> 08:31.185
Where's my shoe?

08:45.465 --> 08:50.171
I'm telling you: This will be
the best time of our whole lives!

08:51.938 --> 08:54.942
Oh, come on! Your Mau will be
okay without you for once.

09:06.886 --> 09:10.457
Mau?

09:10.490 --> 09:14.562
No. That's... impossible.

09:18.497 --> 09:24.037
Huh?! This... this can't be!
Am I hearing Mau?

09:24.603 --> 09:26.372
Mau?

09:55.135 --> 09:59.573
Oh no! I'm missing Mau so much
I'm hearing things!

10:27.467 --> 10:33.073
MY dad said the building we're staying in is
an old water mill that's part of a castle.

10:33.106 --> 10:36.109
That's where the peasants
brought their grain,

10:36.141 --> 10:41.380
and then Baron Kuno took part of it as
payment for giving the peasants protection.

10:41.414 --> 10:43.717
But Kuno was a robber baron.

10:43.750 --> 10:46.986
Robber barons didn't protect
peasants, did they?

10:47.020 --> 10:48.956
Did you know
the place is haunted?

10:48.989 --> 10:52.392
At night, when midnight strikes...

10:52.424 --> 10:57.496
Baron Kuno comes out of his
grave and rattles the doors,

10:57.529 --> 11:03.303
plays hopscotch under your bed and
eats your sausages, if you got any.

11:03.336 --> 11:06.273
No, no, no!
He does absolutely nothing

11:06.305 --> 11:09.709
because there are no ghosts
and we will all sleep well.

11:09.742 --> 11:12.178
No need for any of us
to feel afraid

11:12.212 --> 11:17.417
- or have any trouble at night in a...
- dark... strange old place.

11:17.449 --> 11:20.219
No ghosts, no ghouls, no spooks!

11:20.252 --> 11:25.291
It is a scientifically-proven fact
that ghosts do NOT live under beds.

11:25.324 --> 11:29.195
Really, Lennart? Then
who's standing next to you?

11:29.228 --> 11:31.331
Absolutely no one.

11:33.533 --> 11:35.702
Booh!

11:39.239 --> 11:43.377
That's a new one for you, Simon.

11:43.409 --> 11:48.548
Simon! I knew it was you! As if you
could trick me with something like that!

11:48.581 --> 11:53.486
Nice try though. Only
a silly person would believe in ghosts.

11:54.553 --> 11:58.225
Well, you look pretty silly
to me.

12:00.726 --> 12:03.563
Okay, no more nonsense now.
We're almost there.

12:03.596 --> 12:07.734
And, Lars, please stop eating sausages.
We're having dinner when we arrive.

12:07.766 --> 12:12.472
But who knows if THEY have
sausages. I love sausages!

12:38.530 --> 12:40.366
Wow!

12:40.400 --> 12:43.736
Oh, it's beautiful!

12:43.770 --> 12:46.340
Wow! I can't believe it.

12:48.640 --> 12:51.243
Yeah, not bad.

12:51.276 --> 12:54.613
Hi! Welcome to the old mill!

12:54.646 --> 12:57.616
I'm Miss Weingartner -
your camp supervisor.

12:57.650 --> 13:03.122
And this is our dear Mr Polda who
is always happy to lend a hand.

13:03.155 --> 13:07.493
I sure am! And if you need
anything, just shout!

13:07.526 --> 13:09.462
No, really! I'm hard of hearing!

13:09.496 --> 13:13.799
What? Hello? Hello?
Ah, what did you say? I, dah...

13:18.605 --> 13:23.143
Okay, let's get all your luggage to your
rooms and then we'll meet up for dinner.

13:23.175 --> 13:24.443
What are we having?

13:24.476 --> 13:27.880
Sausages!
You like sausages, don't you?

13:27.914 --> 13:30.717
Yes!

13:33.620 --> 13:36.423
Eh... who owns the green bag?

13:36.456 --> 13:38.459
That's mine.

13:45.198 --> 13:46.900
Ouch! Something scratched me.

13:46.933 --> 13:52.806
- Lars, check this out.
- I've a few scratches of my own!

13:53.573 --> 13:55.842
Huh?

13:55.875 --> 13:58.712
Are you looking for something,
young lady?

13:58.745 --> 14:02.582
No, Mr Polda, thanks.
I have everything.

14:02.615 --> 14:04.784
Hmm.

14:20.900 --> 14:22.903
Wow! Wow!

14:22.935 --> 14:24.770
Okay, this is mine.

14:24.803 --> 14:27.606
I'm sleeping here!

14:27.640 --> 14:29.875
This looks like it used to be
an old barn.

14:29.909 --> 14:36.750
Maybe this is where the spirit of the
dead robber baron sleeps EVERY night!

14:40.385 --> 14:43.189
No, please, Lars.
Stop that nonsense.

14:43.222 --> 14:45.791
Okay, okay,
unpack your things now.

14:45.824 --> 14:48.794
We've a little time
before dinner.

14:48.827 --> 14:51.398
I don't think so! Look!

14:53.232 --> 14:56.869
Mmm! I can already
smell the sausages!

14:56.903 --> 14:58.872
- Let's go down there!
- Yay! - Woo-hoo!

14:58.904 --> 15:02.775
Hang on! Wait, wait! Not so...

15:07.447 --> 15:10.217
So, does everyone have
a sausage or some bread rolls?

15:10.250 --> 15:12.719
- Yes!
- Yes, thank you, Miss Weingartner.

15:12.751 --> 15:14.453
We also have
ketchup and mustard,

15:14.486 --> 15:20.360
and there is a lovely beetroot and broccoli
salad on the table if anyone wants some.

15:31.571 --> 15:34.941
Since when do you eat
beetroot and broccoli salad?

15:34.973 --> 15:39.813
Since right now.
I've had sausages up to here!

15:39.846 --> 15:42.948
Look, guys! My sword!

15:42.981 --> 15:46.519
With this, I'll make any ghost
run for his life!

15:46.552 --> 15:47.420
En garde!

15:47.452 --> 15:50.457
Hey, watch it!

15:54.427 --> 15:57.397
Your sword is a sausage sling!

15:59.899 --> 16:02.302
Let's see where it landed.

16:52.117 --> 16:54.420
Where did it go?

17:02.627 --> 17:04.831
Hello?

17:06.966 --> 17:10.370
Mau?! Mau, is that you? Mau?

17:10.402 --> 17:12.972
Mau, wait! Stay! Come here!

17:13.538 --> 17:14.740
Ah!

17:14.774 --> 17:17.377
What?! Who?! Eh...

17:17.843 --> 17:19.845
Who are you?!

17:31.957 --> 17:34.460
Leave him alone!

17:37.964 --> 17:40.400
Up here, you baby!

17:41.667 --> 17:43.870
Give him to me, kid!

17:43.902 --> 17:45.438
And who are you?

17:45.470 --> 17:48.440
Give him to me!
Otherwise he'll bite you.

17:48.474 --> 17:53.413
I know how to treat animals.
I have a cat.

17:53.446 --> 17:55.682
I wanted a cat too

17:55.715 --> 17:59.919
but my mom is allergic
to them. Now I have Oskar.

17:59.951 --> 18:02.521
And Oskar is allowed
to just run around here?

18:02.554 --> 18:07.659
You think I was in the tree to
study leaves?! I keep my eye on him.

18:07.692 --> 18:10.429
Wow! A raccoon!

18:13.166 --> 18:16.870
Oh, he's so cute! May I pet him?

18:16.902 --> 18:20.906
- Luca?
- Oh, popsicles! Mom!

18:23.609 --> 18:26.678
What? What is Oskar doing here?

18:26.711 --> 18:30.949
You know I don't want him running around
loose. Put him in his pen right now!

18:30.983 --> 18:34.854
- But, Mom!
- Take him away. Immediately!

18:34.887 --> 18:40.025
- Timbuktu!
- Watch your language, Luca!

18:40.059 --> 18:44.597
Come now. You better get back to the fire.
Your sausages are starting to burn.

18:46.098 --> 18:49.770
- Bless you, Miss Weingartner.
- Thank you.

18:52.905 --> 18:54.741
Huh?

18:56.141 --> 18:58.143
Are you coming, Conni?

18:58.177 --> 18:59.678
Yes.

19:14.593 --> 19:17.496
Huh... Wow, it's weird.

19:17.530 --> 19:23.002
This is the first time I've slept
without Mau on my bed since... forever.

19:23.034 --> 19:26.206
I wonder what
that silly furball is up to.

19:26.238 --> 19:30.843
Oh, Mau!
I do wish you were here!

19:30.877 --> 19:34.781
Oh! What a beautiful
evening, Lennart. Isn't it?

19:34.813 --> 19:39.651
In the city, you forget that
there are so many stars in the sky.

19:39.685 --> 19:43.957
You know, if you see a
shooting star, you have to make a wish.

19:43.989 --> 19:47.893
- A wish?
- Yup! What would you wish for?

19:47.927 --> 19:50.563
To be as strong as
a ninja turtle?

19:57.637 --> 19:59.973
What's the matter, Lennart?

20:00.005 --> 20:03.775
I think I'm gonna
go back inside, okay?

20:03.809 --> 20:05.078
Lennart?

20:46.986 --> 20:49.855
Huh?! Who's that?

20:49.889 --> 20:56.029
Lars? Laura? Semire?
Are you sleeping?

20:56.062 --> 20:59.765
Is anyone there? Baron?

20:59.798 --> 21:02.968
Oh Conni, stop being silly!

21:03.002 --> 21:06.540
It can't be Baron Kuno's ghost!
There's no such a thing!

21:07.640 --> 21:10.642
Huh?

21:10.676 --> 21:14.047
Lars!
Is that you fooling around?

21:25.658 --> 21:26.959
Hello?

21:29.996 --> 21:31.730
Is that...

21:31.764 --> 21:33.699
Mau? Mau?

21:35.834 --> 21:40.105
What are you doing here?!
Oh Mau, my sweetie! Come here!

21:42.975 --> 21:46.813
Oh no, no, no, no! Mau! Don't!

21:47.947 --> 21:50.050
- Agh!
- Oh!

21:51.383 --> 21:53.652
Mau!

21:53.686 --> 21:55.188
Oh Mau, it was you all along!

21:55.220 --> 21:59.092
- - What?
- What was that?

22:02.894 --> 22:05.030
What was that?

22:05.063 --> 22:10.769
What? I didn't see anything. Nothing at
all just hopped across your beds!

22:13.773 --> 22:15.308
You okay?

22:15.341 --> 22:18.144
Yep! Yep, sure!

22:22.448 --> 22:25.118
Dancing pigtail...

22:25.150 --> 22:28.787
Just... go back... to sleep.

22:33.059 --> 22:35.795
How did you get here?

22:35.828 --> 22:38.665
And what am I supposed to do
with you?

22:38.698 --> 22:39.765
You're not allowed here!

22:39.798 --> 22:42.868
<

22:45.371 --> 22:47.172
Mau, that's a great idea!

22:54.146 --> 22:56.416
What am I going to do
with you, Mau?

22:58.717 --> 23:00.986
No one can know
that you're here.

23:03.389 --> 23:06.192
Everyone will think
I brought you on purpose.

23:06.225 --> 23:10.396
We'll be sent home,
and Mom and Dad will be really angry!

23:11.996 --> 23:14.933
And why would you do
something like that?

23:16.869 --> 23:20.707
Yeah... "Meow, meow,
meow" - that's all you can say.

23:20.739 --> 23:25.077
I get that, you silly cat! But
you can't let anyone see you.

23:25.111 --> 23:27.380
Do you understand? No one!

23:29.915 --> 23:33.219
You cuddly cat!

23:58.476 --> 24:00.947
Hmm? Huh?! HUH?!

24:00.979 --> 24:02.380
Where's Mau?!

24:07.419 --> 24:10.290
Mau? Mau?

24:17.996 --> 24:19.998
Where are you?

24:38.918 --> 24:41.219
Mau! Stop!

24:41.253 --> 24:43.255
Huh?

24:45.056 --> 24:48.794
♪ Stop-hob hop! Stop-hob hop!

24:48.828 --> 24:50.830
♪ The dork, the duck,
♪ my uncle Fred

24:50.862 --> 24:53.498
♪ The bug, the fox,
♪ all sing ahead... ♪

24:53.532 --> 24:55.901
Oh yeah! I see!

24:55.935 --> 24:58.471
- Hi!
- City kids.

24:58.504 --> 25:03.309
Phew!

25:10.615 --> 25:13.051
Mau! Don't!

25:19.057 --> 25:22.060
- - Mum! Mum!
- What is it, honey?

25:22.093 --> 25:26.498
Mum! Mum, come quick!
Something else has been stolen!

25:26.532 --> 25:30.570
What? No! What is it this time?

25:30.602 --> 25:31.137
A ring!

25:31.169 --> 25:35.140
Oh no. Okay, I'm coming!

25:49.287 --> 25:51.990
Oh no!

25:59.931 --> 26:01.500
Oh...

26:08.640 --> 26:11.944
Mau? Mau?

26:11.976 --> 26:14.380
Conni! Breakfast!

26:21.387 --> 26:22.655
Good morning!

26:22.688 --> 26:24.489
Where were you hiding?

26:24.523 --> 26:27.193
Oh, I... ehm...
I was up in the attic.

26:27.226 --> 26:31.597
I slept there because...
because Lars was snoring so much.

26:31.630 --> 26:33.466
Me? Really?

26:33.498 --> 26:36.302
That's strange.
I didn't hear Lars snore.

26:37.569 --> 26:40.306
Good morning, everybody!

26:40.339 --> 26:45.144
Ehm... did I just dream it or did someone
really jump on our beds last night?

26:45.177 --> 26:47.112
Yeah! I noticed that too!

26:47.146 --> 26:48.313
Me too!

26:48.346 --> 26:51.316
Maybe it was the ghost
of Baron Kuno.

26:51.350 --> 26:54.186
I heard his voice.
I heard him say:

26:54.218 --> 26:59.659
"I am Baron Kuno!
Where is Lennnaaart?"

27:01.293 --> 27:03.996
Luca Weingartner!

27:04.028 --> 27:05.430
Mum?

27:05.464 --> 27:07.700
You promised me that Oskar
wouldn't run around loose!

27:07.733 --> 27:10.669
He didn't. Oskar is in his pen!

27:10.703 --> 27:14.140
So who made the mess in the garden?
All of the eggs are smashed;

27:14.172 --> 27:18.009
I wouldn't be surprised if
Oskar stole the ring too.

27:19.445 --> 27:23.416
What? No way! Oskar would
never do that! Why would he?!

27:23.448 --> 27:27.986
Go outside and clean the table and bench
before anyone messes up their things!

27:28.019 --> 27:29.521
Timbuktu!

27:29.554 --> 27:32.926
Please and thank you, Luca! Now!

27:35.226 --> 27:38.229
Maybe Oskar would be
better off at the petting zoo.

27:38.263 --> 27:40.466
What?!

27:44.203 --> 27:48.407
Conni? Hello? Conni?

27:48.439 --> 27:52.544
Conni... Hello? Conni?! Hello?

27:52.578 --> 27:54.347
- Conni!
- Yes?

27:54.380 --> 27:56.082
Is everything okay, Conni?

27:56.114 --> 28:00.652
Yes... Yes...
Everything is... fine.

28:13.798 --> 28:16.201
Hi Hanne.
Is everything alright so far.

28:16.235 --> 28:21.407
Yeah, thanks, we feel very
comfortable here. What happened?

28:21.439 --> 28:26.411
Oh, the usual chaos. First, Luca's
raccoon turned over a basket with eggs,

28:26.445 --> 28:29.381
and then things keep
disappearing lately -

28:29.415 --> 28:32.118
Last week it was a bracelet,
today a guest's ring.

28:32.150 --> 28:34.285
- Stolen?
- Huh?

28:34.319 --> 28:40.292
It's hard to believe, I know. I mean, what
thief would find his way all the way here?

28:40.324 --> 28:41.760
NO!

28:44.362 --> 28:50.503
No... I mean... I mean... I don't believe
that a raccoon steals rings.

28:50.535 --> 28:55.307
Where is Oskar's pen?
We could have a look.

28:59.244 --> 29:02.782
Behind the blackberry bushes,
next to the chicken coop.

29:02.814 --> 29:07.053
You're welcome to look at it
but do NOT open the gate!

29:07.085 --> 29:10.455
Oh I wouldn't dream of doing
anything without adult assistance.

29:10.488 --> 29:13.659
I'm coming!

29:13.691 --> 29:16.327
- Me too!
- Okay, let's go!

29:16.361 --> 29:19.564
Don't be too long.
We want to check out the bear cave later!

29:19.598 --> 29:22.501
- Okay! - Okay! We won't be!
- Sure!

29:22.534 --> 29:27.105
For a minute there,
I thought you said 'bear cave'!

31:21.320 --> 31:23.389
Look! There he is!

31:24.590 --> 31:27.693
Oh! Isn't he cute!

31:27.726 --> 31:31.496
He looks like a weird cat.
You know, like a furball.

31:33.732 --> 31:37.203
So... I...
I'll look around a bit.

31:37.236 --> 31:39.604
But... but you wanted to go
to the pen.

31:39.638 --> 31:42.374
Now I wanna look around a bit.

31:42.407 --> 31:47.279
Conni, what's going on with you?
You've been acting weird since we got here.

31:47.312 --> 31:50.248
Come on, tell me.

31:52.851 --> 31:55.420
We're your friends.

31:57.656 --> 32:00.459
If you promise
that you won't tell anyone,

32:00.492 --> 32:03.361
especially not
Hanne and Lennart.

32:04.563 --> 32:05.797
- Okay!
- Sure.

32:05.831 --> 32:09.868
It wasn't a ghost
that jumped on you last night.

32:09.900 --> 32:11.603
Then what was it?

32:11.637 --> 32:14.340
It was... Mau!

32:14.372 --> 32:17.642
Mau? Like YOUR Mau?

32:17.676 --> 32:20.412
Like 'meow' Mau?
How did he get here.

32:20.445 --> 32:22.915
How else?
Conni brought him with her.

32:22.948 --> 32:27.319
I did not! He got on the bus
when we left.

32:27.351 --> 32:29.487
But no one will believe me.

32:29.521 --> 32:31.890
Wow, are you in trouble!

32:36.762 --> 32:38.429
We have to hide him.

32:38.463 --> 32:43.869
First, we have to find him.
I have no idea where he is.

32:43.901 --> 32:46.838
Don't worry.
We can handle this together.

32:47.672 --> 32:50.675
- Really?
- Sure.

32:50.708 --> 32:52.710
What would I do
without my friends?!

32:52.744 --> 32:54.980
It's what friends are for.

32:55.013 --> 32:57.483
Okay then, let's go!
We'll spread out.

32:57.515 --> 33:00.553
Okay, good.
Together we can do it!

33:04.956 --> 33:07.525
Mau? Mau, kitty whiskers?

33:07.559 --> 33:11.730
Fluffy? Pusspuss? Cat Stevens?

33:11.763 --> 33:14.667
Kitty? Tabby? Tiger?

33:14.699 --> 33:16.601
- Mau!
- Mau?

33:16.634 --> 33:18.002
Mau!

33:18.035 --> 33:21.606
Hey you!
What are you doing here?

33:21.640 --> 33:25.343
Me? I... I...

33:25.377 --> 33:26.278
I wanted to look at the pen.

33:26.312 --> 33:30.916
The pen is
none of your business!

33:31.783 --> 33:33.952
It's MY pen.

33:33.985 --> 33:38.823
Why are you always so unfriendly?
Can't you be nice once in a while?

33:38.857 --> 33:42.895
Why should I be nice to you?
Next week you'll be gone again

33:42.928 --> 33:47.033
and then the next guests will come,
and they'll just stay a week too.

33:57.743 --> 34:00.678
Don't you have any friends?

34:00.711 --> 34:03.548
I don't need friends.
I have Oskar.

34:03.582 --> 34:06.552
My cat is called Mau.

34:08.452 --> 34:12.490
Watch out! The gate!
He can't get out.

34:16.461 --> 34:18.964
Luca...

34:18.997 --> 34:21.834
I know that Oskar
didn't break the eggs.

34:22.566 --> 34:24.570
What? How?

34:24.602 --> 34:26.037
How do you know?

34:27.472 --> 34:28.907
Who was it then?

34:28.939 --> 34:32.443
Ehm... ehm...
I can't tell you that.

34:32.477 --> 34:34.813
So then, it was YOU
who broke them!

34:34.845 --> 34:36.581
Me? No!

34:36.615 --> 34:38.484
Then tell me - who did it?

34:41.452 --> 34:45.390
My mother is already so mad at Oskar, she's
blaming him for everything that goes wrong!

34:45.423 --> 34:49.927
Simon? Anna?
Conni? Let's go, everyone!

34:49.961 --> 34:53.732
- So, who did it?
- I... I have to go.

34:53.764 --> 34:56.901
You don't know anything!
You just make things up

34:56.934 --> 35:00.805
so that everyone loves
their "Conni, Conni, Conni"!

35:00.838 --> 35:02.574
Not true!

35:03.874 --> 35:05.977
And no wonder
you have no friends!

35:06.010 --> 35:09.481
Wait! Conni?

36:29.160 --> 36:31.230
Welcome to the Blue Hill Cave!

36:31.262 --> 36:34.198
Hello, Mr Polda.

36:34.231 --> 36:36.934
Now, have any
of you been to a cave before?

36:36.968 --> 36:40.239
I have!
I've been to a dripstone cave.

36:40.271 --> 36:43.508
Great! We have dripstones
here too.

36:43.541 --> 36:45.877
And also something very special:

36:45.910 --> 36:48.947
Ancient cave bears
used to live here.

36:48.979 --> 36:51.082
Wow!

36:51.115 --> 36:53.686
Cave bears?!

36:55.553 --> 36:57.523
But they aren't in there
anymore, right?

36:57.555 --> 37:00.892
No! They died out long ago.

37:00.925 --> 37:05.029
But there are still traces
of them. So let's go!

37:07.631 --> 37:11.936
But please be careful - these
columns took thousands of years to grow

37:11.970 --> 37:15.541
and are very, VERY sensitive.
So no touching!

37:15.573 --> 37:20.079
Oh! In that case, maybe we should turn
back now in case we mess anything up?

37:20.678 --> 37:22.113
Huh? No?

37:23.615 --> 37:25.317
Wow!

37:25.349 --> 37:28.586
- Oh my!
- Look at the colours of the stones!

37:28.619 --> 37:32.256
They are growing from the
ground up, and from the ceiling down.

37:32.289 --> 37:34.892
Yeah! Like... teeth!

37:34.925 --> 37:38.630
Hey Lennart, we are walking
in the mouth

37:38.662 --> 37:40.765
of a dead cave bear.

37:40.798 --> 37:45.036
Oh, thank you, Lars.
That's very nice.

37:51.343 --> 37:55.047
Mr Polda? Is there
any cool bear stuff to see?

37:55.079 --> 37:57.648
Bones! Even a whole skeleton!

37:57.682 --> 38:01.019
And footprints.
And they're right here!

38:01.052 --> 38:03.121
- Wow! - Look at that!
- That's amazing!

38:03.153 --> 38:06.724
The ground was much
softer here back in those days.

38:06.758 --> 38:10.062
When animals or humans
stepped on it,

38:10.095 --> 38:14.600
they left footprints which then got
hard and solid over thousands of years.

38:14.633 --> 38:16.802
Isn't that like
your modelling clay?

38:16.834 --> 38:18.704
I have it here.

38:20.838 --> 38:23.275
Oh yeah! Yeah! Incredible!

38:23.307 --> 38:26.311
Conni is a cave bear!

38:26.343 --> 38:28.112
No!

38:28.146 --> 38:31.883
However, there is much more
to see in these old caverns.

38:31.916 --> 38:33.586
Follow me!

39:29.139 --> 39:31.142
Huh? What?!

39:33.278 --> 39:34.913
Where's my sheet?

39:34.945 --> 39:39.450
Oh no! Hay fever!

39:41.151 --> 39:43.755
What now?
Am I getting hiccups too?!

39:46.191 --> 39:48.994
What? My bed sheet? Walking?

39:51.229 --> 39:54.765
Oskar! How...?

39:54.798 --> 39:56.400
Luca?

39:56.434 --> 39:59.204
Luca Weingartner,
come here at once!

40:03.041 --> 40:06.311
And this, kids,
is a real live skeleton

40:06.343 --> 40:08.880
of a real NOT live cave bear.

40:08.912 --> 40:11.148
- Wow!
- Creepy!

40:11.182 --> 40:15.887
- Ooh!
- That's amazing! - Wow!

40:15.919 --> 40:18.923
People also
lived here at one time...

40:18.956 --> 40:22.126
not with the bears, though,
of course!

40:22.160 --> 40:24.463
That probably
wouldn't have worked.

40:24.496 --> 40:26.898
Good thing it's not alive.

40:29.534 --> 40:32.137
Huh?

40:42.780 --> 40:45.450
The bear! The cave bear's here!

40:59.564 --> 41:02.334
Huh?

41:02.367 --> 41:05.269
Popsicles!

41:05.302 --> 41:09.473
Everyone stay calm. We'll just
keep walking to the exit.

41:09.506 --> 41:13.778
I'll go last and make sure
no one gets eaten.

41:14.445 --> 41:16.814
Follow me! Single file!

41:18.182 --> 41:20.985
Wow! I still have goosebumps.

41:21.019 --> 41:23.053
Yeah, that was creepy!

41:23.086 --> 41:25.422
I could play a relaxing tune.

41:25.456 --> 41:27.992
No! Thank you, Semire.

41:28.026 --> 41:30.262
But please... later, okay?

41:34.198 --> 41:36.834
- < Psst, hey! Hey!
- Huh?

41:38.269 --> 41:39.905
How was your trip?

41:39.938 --> 41:41.472
Scary!

41:41.506 --> 41:45.143
Really? Why? What happened?

41:45.175 --> 41:47.912
Did an evil cave bear
try to eat you?

41:47.945 --> 41:50.014
It was you!

41:51.615 --> 41:55.152
- Now who's being unfriendly?
- You are rude!

41:55.186 --> 41:57.523
Well then,
tell me who broke the eggs.

42:01.291 --> 42:03.127
It was...

42:03.160 --> 42:06.898
Luca! Luca, where were you?!

42:06.930 --> 42:09.934
Oh, shrubbery plants!
What have I done now?

42:09.968 --> 42:12.236
Look what Oskar has done!

42:12.269 --> 42:16.006
First the scrambled eggs in the
garden, now the torn sheets!

42:16.039 --> 42:20.579
- That wasn't Oskar, Mom! He'd never do that!
- I caught him in the act!

42:20.611 --> 42:22.947
But I... I trimmed his claws
only yesterday and I...

42:22.981 --> 42:25.851
Luca, it's over!

42:29.519 --> 42:32.189
I'm calling the petting zoo
to see if they'll take him.

42:32.222 --> 42:35.259
Mom, please!

42:35.293 --> 42:38.063
This can't go on, Luca.

42:38.095 --> 42:41.198
The petting zoo has other
raccoons and friends for him.

42:41.231 --> 42:44.369
You can't do that!
Oskar is my only friend!

42:44.401 --> 42:48.639
It's over!
Oskar probably stole the jewellery too.

42:52.977 --> 42:55.947
Come on, Conni. Let's go.

42:55.979 --> 42:58.315
Wait! Miss Weingartner,

42:58.349 --> 43:01.385
that thing with the eggs...
and the sheet...

43:01.418 --> 43:03.387
it wasn't Oskar.

43:03.421 --> 43:05.490
It was my cat Mau.

43:07.492 --> 43:10.928
I didn't want to bring him,
but he followed me and...

43:10.961 --> 43:14.099
That's really very sweet of
you to try to help Luca

43:14.131 --> 43:18.102
but if a cat were running around here
dear, I'd be sneezing constantly.

43:18.135 --> 43:20.971
But, Miss Weingartner,
it's true!

43:21.005 --> 43:23.675
Sweetheart, listen,
that can't be:

43:23.707 --> 43:26.644
My allergies are never wrong.

43:26.677 --> 43:30.414
Pets may only be brought here by prior
arrangement and under strict rules,

43:30.447 --> 43:34.551
and any guest bringing one without
permission will be asked to leave!

43:34.584 --> 43:38.490
What?!

43:38.523 --> 43:42.559
Same as always: Grown-ups
only believe grown-ups!

43:42.593 --> 43:46.698
Come on, Conni. Let's go back.
I'm as hungry as a 'beaaar'!

43:55.006 --> 43:56.508
Excuse me?

43:56.541 --> 43:58.977
Does the Weingartner family
live here?

43:59.010 --> 44:00.712
Yes, sir.

44:00.744 --> 44:03.614
Great. I'm here to look at a raccoon
that might be coming to our zoo.

44:03.648 --> 44:06.718
You don't happen to know
where he is? Do you?

44:06.751 --> 44:09.653
Um... well...

44:09.686 --> 44:12.589
Ah! I've been expecting you.
Oskar is back here.

44:12.622 --> 44:16.160
Hi Miss Weingartner. Thanks.
We have to be sure the animals are safe

44:16.193 --> 44:20.097
to be petted by children. All
part of what we do, you know.

44:20.131 --> 44:24.970
Oh, he is as gentle as a lamb.
And twice as fluffy!

44:45.088 --> 44:47.391
What?!

44:48.760 --> 44:51.196
Where's my bracelet?

44:53.764 --> 44:56.700
This is really delicious,
Miss Weingartner.

44:56.733 --> 45:00.104
Thank you, Simon,
I'm glad you like it.

45:01.773 --> 45:06.044
Has one of you seen my bracelet?

45:06.077 --> 45:08.713
I put it on the windowsill
and now it's gone!

45:08.746 --> 45:12.483
- Oh my!
- Oh dear, what did you say, Laura?

45:12.517 --> 45:16.354
- My bracelet is gone!
- It just vanished.

45:16.387 --> 45:17.789
Huh?

45:17.822 --> 45:19.758
Oh sweetheart,
how did that happen?

45:22.126 --> 45:26.363
Well... nobody was in the room
except me

45:26.396 --> 45:29.034
and I put the bracelet
on the windowsill.

45:29.066 --> 45:31.168
There must have been someone
at the window.

45:31.202 --> 45:33.805
I bet it was
the flying Baron Kuno ghost.

45:37.374 --> 45:41.512
It was a present from
my grandma... my favourite!

45:41.546 --> 45:46.351
Oh dear. Maybe it just fell
out of the window.

45:46.383 --> 45:48.719
Come on, Laura. Together we'll
have a look again.

45:48.753 --> 45:53.358
Let me know
if you don't find it, okay?

45:53.390 --> 45:57.729
And would two of you be so kind as to help
me clear up? That would be really nice.

45:58.729 --> 46:00.532
- Of course!
- Yes.

46:11.175 --> 46:15.412
You've earned a piece of cake
for all that. Good job!

46:15.445 --> 46:18.215
Thank you, Miss Weingartner!

46:34.432 --> 46:36.568
Is everything okay?

46:36.601 --> 46:39.738
You look... like
you've seen a ghost.

46:40.570 --> 46:42.539
Miss Weingartner!

46:42.572 --> 46:44.842
M-m-my cat!

46:47.378 --> 46:51.316
Please, Conni... if
there was really a cat here,

46:51.349 --> 46:55.352
I would have it in a shelter quicker
than you could say...

46:56.753 --> 46:59.190
I think I've caught a cold!

47:02.459 --> 47:04.463
And now...

47:07.231 --> 47:08.867
to bed.

47:08.900 --> 47:10.901
Okay! Sure!

47:10.934 --> 47:12.803
Good... goodnight!

47:16.240 --> 47:18.510
City kids!

47:25.582 --> 47:28.253
We found Mau.

47:28.285 --> 47:29.787
And did you catch him?

47:29.820 --> 47:32.890
No. Miss Weingartner
did that for us.

47:32.923 --> 47:38.396
It's true. Miss Weingartner locked him
in her pantry, but she doesn't know it.

47:38.428 --> 47:41.698
I wish someone would
lock ME into the pantry sometime.

47:41.731 --> 47:43.634
So she'll find him
in the morning.

47:43.668 --> 47:45.903
That absolutely can't happen!

47:45.936 --> 47:48.939
Otherwise she'll bring him
straight to the animal shelter.

47:48.972 --> 47:51.476
We have to get him out...

47:51.508 --> 47:53.577
tonight!

47:53.610 --> 47:57.247
- I'll join you.
- Tonight?

47:57.280 --> 47:58.682
Yes! Tonight!

48:22.840 --> 48:24.543
Careful!

48:29.546 --> 48:32.217
Shh!

48:34.017 --> 48:35.954
Be careful, Anna!

48:41.992 --> 48:43.661
Huh?

48:47.497 --> 48:49.700
Sneaky city kids.

48:57.340 --> 49:00.744
I just
don't understand it, Lennart,

49:00.778 --> 49:05.283
is it possible I'm allergic
to raccoons now too?

49:06.717 --> 49:10.789
That was closed
just a second ago, wasn't it?

49:17.528 --> 49:21.399
Hmm... nothing.

49:21.432 --> 49:24.901
Now you all better get ready.

49:29.539 --> 49:32.543
I just don't
understand it, Lennart.

49:32.575 --> 49:35.947
When I get stuffy, I usually
help myself to a nice cup of tea.

49:35.979 --> 49:40.017
Shall I get you one
from the kitchen?

49:40.050 --> 49:42.919
No, Lennart, thank you.
It's late already

49:42.952 --> 49:45.555
and I'm looking forward
to a good night's sleep.

49:45.588 --> 49:48.025
Oh yeah, that's a good idea.

49:56.633 --> 49:58.736
Huh? What's that?

49:59.970 --> 50:02.506
That's unusual.

50:07.345 --> 50:12.317
Maybe it was Baron Kuno playing a game
of footie with little pebbles!

50:12.349 --> 50:13.817
Do you think he would do that?!

50:18.555 --> 50:19.823
Mau?

50:19.856 --> 50:21.092
Oh no!

50:21.124 --> 50:22.893
What's happened?

50:22.927 --> 50:24.928
He ate the whole cake!

50:28.365 --> 50:30.767
He'll eat his way
through the whole castle!

50:30.800 --> 50:34.404
Oh Mau, you need to be a good
boy and not a greedy boots!

50:34.438 --> 50:37.842
Let's go. We have to get back,

50:37.874 --> 50:40.577
Did you
ever play football, Lennart?

50:40.610 --> 50:42.646
Yes, actually
I still am playing...

50:42.680 --> 50:45.582
- Keep moving!
- ..In a fantasy league.

50:45.615 --> 50:51.021
That's it for me!
I'm going to bed. Are you staying up?

50:51.055 --> 50:53.558
No! I'm not
staying alone down here!

50:53.590 --> 50:55.592
I-I-I mean...
I need a good night's sleep

50:55.626 --> 50:58.563
to be ready for the children
tomorrow.

50:58.595 --> 51:02.400
You don't really believe
in ghosts, Lennart, do you?

51:02.432 --> 51:03.934
Me? Absolutely not!

51:03.968 --> 51:07.538
After all, I am an adult...
I'm not afraid of the dark

51:07.570 --> 51:12.843
or ghosts or strange noises or
doors that are a little bit open.

51:13.577 --> 51:16.147
Shh!

51:16.180 --> 51:18.983
Whoa! Ouch!

51:19.015 --> 51:21.151
- Simon!
- Shh!

51:21.184 --> 51:23.688
Did you hear that?!

51:23.720 --> 51:27.023
- - What was that?
- I have no idea!

51:27.057 --> 51:28.993
That was the wrong answer.

51:29.026 --> 51:32.997
There's someone in the
costume chamber!

51:33.030 --> 51:36.601
What if the someone
enjoys his privacy? You know...

51:36.633 --> 51:38.602
Lennart, there are no ghosts.

51:38.635 --> 51:40.771
Yeah, sure.
But does the ghost know that?

51:40.805 --> 51:43.140
Huh?!

51:46.209 --> 51:48.479
They heard us!

51:49.979 --> 51:51.615
Hide!

52:07.865 --> 52:09.000
Huh?!

52:09.032 --> 52:11.968
Boo!

52:12.001 --> 52:14.738
What's that?

52:14.771 --> 52:16.606
I gotcha!

52:16.639 --> 52:19.009
Whoa! Is that a cat?

52:19.043 --> 52:21.178
That's 'Mau' to you!

52:21.211 --> 52:25.650
What?! Then he's
the one who made the mess!

52:25.682 --> 52:27.517
He followed me.

52:27.550 --> 52:29.619
And YOU can't tell on him!

52:29.653 --> 52:32.122
But my mom
blames Oskar for all of it!

52:32.155 --> 52:34.659
Hello? Someone there?

52:40.930 --> 52:42.434
Hello?

52:44.668 --> 52:46.738
Hide! Now!

52:57.146 --> 53:01.151
Shh! Come on now.
Good Mau! Quiet!

53:01.184 --> 53:03.688
- Excuse me?
- Ah! Lennart!

53:18.035 --> 53:21.105
We just heard a scream.

53:21.137 --> 53:26.244
Really? So did I...
Oh, you mean another scream!

53:26.276 --> 53:28.912
Ehm...

53:31.115 --> 53:33.051
Shh!

53:40.090 --> 53:41.992
Sorry!

53:49.066 --> 53:51.736
Is anyone here?

53:51.769 --> 53:53.638
Yes! I am!

54:10.086 --> 54:13.224
- I'm trapped!
- Lennart!

54:21.097 --> 54:24.302
I can't see!

54:24.334 --> 54:26.303
Let's go!

54:26.336 --> 54:28.739
I can't breathe!

54:31.909 --> 54:34.945
I'm trapped! I can't see!

54:34.979 --> 54:37.747
- Come on!
- I can't breathe!

54:37.780 --> 54:40.717
I can't feel my
face! Where Is my face?!

54:50.660 --> 54:53.664
Help! Help!
Don't let the Baron take me!

54:53.697 --> 54:54.697
Huh?!

55:17.688 --> 55:19.624
- Huh?
- Huh?

55:20.691 --> 55:22.627
Huh?

55:28.398 --> 55:30.101
Frazzlesticks!

55:30.133 --> 55:33.704
Shh!

55:46.015 --> 55:48.052
Gotcha! Huh?!

55:49.253 --> 55:51.322
What in the world?!

55:52.856 --> 55:55.994
Those definitely
don't belong to Baron Kuno.

56:03.400 --> 56:05.403
Wait! It's Luca!

56:09.338 --> 56:13.209
So your sweet little
kitty tore up the sheets!

56:13.242 --> 56:15.912
My cat!

56:15.945 --> 56:18.081
And, yes... he broke the eggs.

56:18.115 --> 56:20.151
And ate the cake. Oh!

56:20.184 --> 56:22.720
Which cake? The cheese cake?

56:22.753 --> 56:24.689
Oh brother!

56:24.722 --> 56:27.258
He probably stole
the jewellery as well!

56:27.291 --> 56:29.325
Mau would never do that, Luca!

56:29.358 --> 56:33.764
You have to show him to my mother.
You've got to tell her about Mau!

56:33.796 --> 56:37.967
I wanted to... I did!
But she just won't believe me.

56:38.001 --> 56:41.939
And anyway,
Mau just ran off again.

56:41.972 --> 56:44.374
But she said she'd take Mau
to an animal shelter!

56:44.407 --> 56:48.045
That's only fair if my Oskar
has to go to a petting zoo!

56:49.278 --> 56:50.481
Yeah.

56:50.514 --> 56:52.950
We should catch
the jewellery thief.

56:52.983 --> 56:55.218
If we do, your mom might let
Oskar and Mau stay here.

56:57.153 --> 56:59.055
That's a great idea, Simon!

56:59.088 --> 57:02.459
- But how do we do that?
- By working together as a team!

57:02.492 --> 57:05.895
And how many marks
out of 10 do you get for that?

57:05.928 --> 57:08.965
Marks! Exactly!

57:08.999 --> 57:12.436
Anna, where's your
modelling clay?

57:12.468 --> 57:17.842
Let's see... Laura's bracelet was
stolen at the window on the first floor

57:17.874 --> 57:23.079
so most likely, the thief is an
animal that can climb really well.

57:23.113 --> 57:25.515
That's why Mum thinks
it's Oskar!

57:25.548 --> 57:29.285
Yep! So we put out some silver
bait and place the clay around it -

57:29.318 --> 57:33.457
when the thief comes, we get his
marks, and then we can catch him.

57:34.390 --> 57:36.827
- Yeah! Yes!
- Yeah!

57:38.162 --> 57:40.497
Yeah... yeah, that could work!

57:40.530 --> 57:43.366
I'll stay awake
and watch the trap.

57:43.400 --> 57:44.802
No, I'll do it.

57:44.834 --> 57:49.039
After all, the thief
is stealing from OUR guests.

57:49.072 --> 57:53.977
Okay,
we're gonna get some sleep. See ya!

57:54.977 --> 57:57.881
Luca?

57:57.914 --> 58:00.517
Thank you
for not telling on Mau.

58:59.642 --> 59:03.880
Now I've got you,
you scallywag thief!

59:03.914 --> 59:05.917
Ugh, popsicles!

59:06.983 --> 59:09.286
Not again!

59:11.387 --> 59:13.857
Just wait! I'll get you!

59:13.890 --> 59:15.226
What's going on here, Luca?

59:15.258 --> 59:18.461
I saw him, Mom! The thief!

59:18.494 --> 59:20.530
What are you talking about?!

59:20.564 --> 59:24.368
The thief who stole
the bracelet and the ring!

59:24.401 --> 59:26.169
- Luca...
- Really!

59:26.202 --> 59:29.840
What were you doing last
night in the costume chamber?

59:33.443 --> 59:35.512
I... we...

59:35.544 --> 59:37.981
Oskar was with you again, right?

59:38.014 --> 59:40.316
I...

59:40.349 --> 59:41.985
it was me.

59:43.486 --> 59:46.956
You took the raccoon
out of the pen AGAIN

59:46.990 --> 59:50.361
and left complete chaos
in the costume chamber. You...

59:50.394 --> 59:52.563
Miss Weingartner?

59:54.231 --> 59:57.568
We...
I was there! We just wanted...

59:57.601 --> 1:00:02.673
Well, it was my cat Mau
that scared Lennart.

1:00:02.706 --> 1:00:05.376
This doesn't make sense
and I can't believe you!

1:00:05.409 --> 1:00:09.680
Luca, you will give Oskar another bath
and get him ready to be picked up today.

1:00:09.713 --> 1:00:14.385
And, Conni, we are going to have a
little chat with Hanne and Lennart!

1:00:14.418 --> 1:00:16.921
Come on!

1:00:16.954 --> 1:00:19.490
I'm sorry; I don't believe
a word, Conni.

1:00:19.523 --> 1:00:22.492
I understand that you wanted
to help your new friend Luca

1:00:22.526 --> 1:00:25.663
but think of all the
terrible mess that was made.

1:00:27.164 --> 1:00:30.334
Conni, I'm sorry
but you're grounded!

1:00:30.367 --> 1:00:35.104
You are to stay here and help with the
dishes while we make the trip to the castle.

1:00:35.137 --> 1:00:39.242
We have to go. Otherwise,
it'll be dark by the time we get back.

1:00:43.680 --> 1:00:47.151
I have to go to the supermarket.
You can help Martha with the dishes.

1:00:47.184 --> 1:00:48.986
- Huh?
- No. No, wait...

1:00:49.019 --> 1:00:52.390
first clean up the broken plate.
Be careful with the shards.

1:00:56.425 --> 1:00:58.194
Huh?

1:01:02.631 --> 1:01:04.968
Miss Weingartner!

1:01:05.001 --> 1:01:08.939
Miss Weingartner!
Miss Weingartner! Wait!

1:01:14.744 --> 1:01:17.347
Luca? Luca?

1:01:19.282 --> 1:01:21.050
Oh, are you ok?

1:01:22.119 --> 1:01:24.722
Mau! Oskar! What are you doing?

1:01:24.755 --> 1:01:27.390
Yeah, these two
get along great...

1:01:28.224 --> 1:01:30.360
like two REAL friends.

1:01:30.394 --> 1:01:32.229
Come down, Luca! Fast!

1:01:32.262 --> 1:01:36.667
Go away, Conni! They're taking
Oskar away from me because of you!

1:01:36.700 --> 1:01:40.571
I need your help! I know
who stole the jewellery.

1:01:40.604 --> 1:01:43.640
Me too - your stupid kitty!

1:01:43.673 --> 1:01:48.012
He's a cat!
And it wasn't Mau! I can prove it!

1:01:50.146 --> 1:01:51.547
Bird footprints!

1:01:51.581 --> 1:01:55.651
I found this feather
after Mau broke the eggs.

1:01:55.684 --> 1:01:59.422
- That's a magpie's feather!
- And that's got to be a magpie footprint!

1:01:59.456 --> 1:02:02.226
And magpies love shiny things!

1:02:02.258 --> 1:02:04.061
So IT stole your knight!

1:02:04.093 --> 1:02:07.463
The people from the petting zoo
are coming soon to pick up Oskar.

1:02:07.497 --> 1:02:10.801
We have to catch the thief
before it's too late!

1:02:10.834 --> 1:02:15.639
Oh... but how will we find out
where the magpie's nest is?

1:02:15.671 --> 1:02:20.244
With the help of the only witness
who almost caught that thief!

1:02:21.677 --> 1:02:24.213
Great!

1:02:40.162 --> 1:02:41.564
Shh!

1:02:48.305 --> 1:02:50.707
- What's he doing?
- Wait! Mau!

1:02:50.740 --> 1:02:53.343
- Huh?!
- Shh!

1:02:53.376 --> 1:02:54.745
Hmm...

1:03:10.293 --> 1:03:12.262
Yes!

1:03:18.501 --> 1:03:21.170
Frazzlesticks!
There's the thief!

1:03:22.606 --> 1:03:24.575
After him, Luca!

1:03:26.343 --> 1:03:30.081
Hey, wait! Conni? Luca?
You're supposed to be grounded!

1:03:30.613 --> 1:03:32.215
A cat?!

1:03:34.284 --> 1:03:36.686
Hang on... What's that?

1:03:43.226 --> 1:03:45.162
Where is it?

1:03:47.396 --> 1:03:50.333
Hide! We can't let them see us!

1:03:55.905 --> 1:03:57.673
What's it doing?

1:03:57.706 --> 1:04:01.177
It... it's flying around
the tower.

1:04:02.579 --> 1:04:06.383
I bet it's flying to its nest!

1:04:06.416 --> 1:04:09.352
The animal keeper from the
petting zoo will be here soon!

1:04:09.385 --> 1:04:12.922
But we can't just march up
there - we're grounded!

1:04:12.956 --> 1:04:18.327
They'll send me home, and Mau might
be sent to some creepy animal refuge!

1:04:19.796 --> 1:04:23.634
And you'll be grounded for
a thousand years... or longer!

1:04:25.367 --> 1:04:27.503
Maybe we can't...

1:04:27.537 --> 1:04:31.608
But I know someone who
can scare them off, so you can sneak up!

1:04:31.640 --> 1:04:33.644
Someone? What?

1:04:33.677 --> 1:04:36.747
Wait and see!

1:04:37.947 --> 1:04:39.516
Huh?

1:04:43.285 --> 1:04:47.323
Look, over there. That's the mill.
Conni's there somewhere.

1:04:47.356 --> 1:04:51.827
- Washing dishes.
- Poor Conni! Not fair.

1:04:51.860 --> 1:04:56.532
Come over here, everyone. Mr Polda
would like to tell you all a bit more.

1:04:56.566 --> 1:05:01.305
Back in the old days, this tower
was very important to Baron Kuno.

1:05:03.639 --> 1:05:07.944
From here, he could
oversee his peasants and their land...

1:05:18.988 --> 1:05:23.492
he would have
armed guards and he would notice

1:05:23.526 --> 1:05:28.265
if anyone was trying to sneak up to his
castle to steal his loot... er, riches!

1:05:28.298 --> 1:05:32.736
Ehm... so, now you see
what a big deal the tower was...

1:05:32.769 --> 1:05:34.838
What is that clattering sound?

1:05:34.871 --> 1:05:37.506
Sounds like someone's
collecting tin cans.

1:05:39.342 --> 1:05:41.878
He could always see what was coming.

1:05:41.910 --> 1:05:45.314
Unless, of course, he couldn't
see what was coming...

1:05:45.347 --> 1:05:47.583
Huh?!

1:05:54.490 --> 1:05:57.594
Huh?

1:06:00.963 --> 1:06:05.334
Leave here...

1:06:05.367 --> 1:06:10.273
or I shall haunt you
for all eternity!

1:06:11.675 --> 1:06:13.043
Oh.

1:06:13.075 --> 1:06:14.977
Oh...

1:06:15.010 --> 1:06:16.545
So, who is that?

1:06:16.579 --> 1:06:19.883
Not... not exactly
a knight to remember, is it?

1:06:19.916 --> 1:06:21.351
Well...

1:06:21.383 --> 1:06:27.023
Make haste, you miserable,
cretinous creatures!

1:06:27.057 --> 1:06:31.361
Huh? What?
This ghost is wearing sneakers!

1:06:31.394 --> 1:06:33.729
- Medieval a fashion statement?
- Wow!

1:06:33.762 --> 1:06:35.665
Agh! Popsicles!

1:06:35.698 --> 1:06:37.334
Let's get him!

1:06:37.367 --> 1:06:38.802
Yeah! Let's get him!

1:06:42.505 --> 1:06:44.807
Go after him! Go get him!
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

1:06:48.912 --> 1:06:51.415
Agh!

1:06:51.447 --> 1:06:52.815
Let's get him!

1:06:52.849 --> 1:06:56.086
- Stop! Stay here! Children?
- Lennart, come on!

1:06:56.119 --> 1:07:00.457
Hanne, I have no intention of chasing after
ghosts! Which don't exist, by the way.

1:07:00.490 --> 1:07:01.858
Fine!

1:07:01.890 --> 1:07:05.361
That went wrong!
Quick, Luca, let's run!

1:07:05.394 --> 1:07:08.030
We'll get him! Keep running!
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

1:07:08.064 --> 1:07:12.102
Oh, Timbuktu! Hide, Conni!
I'll lead them away.

1:07:12.135 --> 1:07:14.405
Yeah, after him!

1:07:24.447 --> 1:07:26.749
Mau! Don't!

1:07:26.782 --> 1:07:29.752
Oh, Timbuktu!

1:07:36.126 --> 1:07:38.996
- Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
- This armour is really great!

1:07:46.635 --> 1:07:50.039
- There he is!
- - Is that Mau?

1:07:57.479 --> 1:07:59.548
Mau, go away! Vanish! Go!

1:07:59.581 --> 1:08:02.685
Whoa!

1:08:04.753 --> 1:08:06.722
Dude?

1:08:34.651 --> 1:08:35.919
Whoa!

1:08:40.857 --> 1:08:43.026
Oh, frazzlesticks!

1:08:47.530 --> 1:08:50.066
There he is!

1:08:50.098 --> 1:08:54.537
Stop! I will take a closer
look at this Baron Kuno.

1:09:00.543 --> 1:09:02.746
Hey! You! You! Get up!

1:09:05.848 --> 1:09:07.617
Be careful, Hanne!

1:09:16.625 --> 1:09:18.594
What on earth?!

1:09:24.901 --> 1:09:28.472
What the... what?

1:09:28.504 --> 1:09:30.806
It's just Mau! Conni was right!

1:09:30.839 --> 1:09:33.576
Mau!

1:09:33.610 --> 1:09:36.079
Baron Kuno is a kitty?
Well, shiver me timbers!

1:09:36.112 --> 1:09:38.849
Whoa!

1:09:38.881 --> 1:09:40.817
Luca!

1:09:40.849 --> 1:09:43.986
That's not a kitty. It's a cat!

1:10:02.571 --> 1:10:04.240
Yes!

1:10:12.014 --> 1:10:14.785
I can't do it.
There's no way I can do this!

1:10:18.086 --> 1:10:22.226
I have to! For Luca.
And especially for Mau!

1:10:30.299 --> 1:10:31.968
Go away!

1:10:40.809 --> 1:10:43.112
I can't do it!

1:10:44.947 --> 1:10:47.950
I can't do it!

1:10:49.184 --> 1:10:51.220
I can't do it! I can't!

1:11:03.732 --> 1:11:06.936
Huh?

1:11:06.969 --> 1:11:09.138
What's that?!

1:11:20.650 --> 1:11:21.918
Yes!

1:11:21.951 --> 1:11:24.821
Shoo! Shoo-shoo! Go away!

1:11:33.729 --> 1:11:36.066
Wow! It is all here!
Even Laura's bracelet!

1:11:36.098 --> 1:11:41.103
I knew it! I knew that you couldn't be that
far away if Mau was here, fooling around.

1:11:41.137 --> 1:11:44.040
Look! Luca, Hanne,
I found the thief!

1:11:44.072 --> 1:11:46.075
Wow!

1:11:46.108 --> 1:11:48.620
Huh?! And that's why we should hurry so
that Oskar won't be taken away, right?

1:11:48.644 --> 1:11:50.780
Yeah!

1:11:50.812 --> 1:11:53.717
We have to go.
Please! We have to hurry!

1:12:03.125 --> 1:12:04.628
Well, then...

1:12:04.661 --> 1:12:09.065
Mom! Now we know who stole Laura's
bracelet! We got it all back! The ring...

1:12:09.098 --> 1:12:11.201
- You're grounded!
- I know, but...

1:12:11.233 --> 1:12:14.803
And weren't you supposed
to work in the kitchen?

1:12:14.836 --> 1:12:18.775
Please, Mom! I had to do it! We had
to prove that Oskar wasn't the thief.

1:12:18.808 --> 1:12:24.080
Oskar also didn't shred the
laundry or break the eggs -

1:12:24.112 --> 1:12:26.249
that was my cat Mau.

1:12:27.916 --> 1:12:30.954
Your... cat?!

1:12:32.321 --> 1:12:35.358
Oh! So now I see
what was going on!

1:12:35.390 --> 1:12:38.762
Oskar didn't do anything, Mom!
He really didn't.

1:12:38.795 --> 1:12:42.699
But, Luca, the people from the
petting zoo were already here and...

1:12:42.732 --> 1:12:44.801
You can't do that!
You just can't!

1:12:44.834 --> 1:12:49.839
I wasn't watching when Mau got on the bus.
He's my cat! You can't take away Luca's...

1:12:49.871 --> 1:12:54.744
Conni, dear, the man from
the petting zoo WAS here...

1:12:54.777 --> 1:12:56.813
and Martha showed me this.

1:12:57.479 --> 1:12:59.314
The prints!

1:12:59.348 --> 1:13:04.120
So I sent the man from the petting
zoo away without Oskar, Luca.

1:13:04.152 --> 1:13:09.458
The little rascal is in the carrier over
there, waiting for all his new friends.

1:13:09.491 --> 1:13:13.796
Ah! Thank you, Mom!
Thank you so much!

1:13:13.830 --> 1:13:16.166
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

1:13:18.134 --> 1:13:22.205
You are just
a fine bunch of detectives.

1:13:22.237 --> 1:13:23.939
I blamed Oskar!

1:13:24.773 --> 1:13:26.809
I am so sorry.

1:13:26.843 --> 1:13:30.013
He's my friend too, and frankly

1:13:30.045 --> 1:13:32.816
I've been very unfair...

1:13:34.916 --> 1:13:37.019
Bless you, Miss Weingartner!

1:13:37.053 --> 1:13:39.354
Oh, popsicles!

1:13:39.388 --> 1:13:40.790
Watch out! The dishes!

1:13:40.822 --> 1:13:43.959
I think
I've finally seen a ghost.

1:13:48.164 --> 1:13:51.166
Well, we can do the dishes
tomorrow

1:13:51.200 --> 1:13:54.237
but today we have a barbecue!

1:13:55.772 --> 1:13:59.075
Hurray!

1:14:05.915 --> 1:14:07.984
So, how's your cat?

1:14:08.017 --> 1:14:10.854
Oh, he's just a happy camper!

1:14:13.255 --> 1:14:14.790
How is Oscar?

1:14:14.823 --> 1:14:21.231
My mum's gonna make him a special meal
tomorrow. He's gonna have a great day!

1:14:21.263 --> 1:14:24.233
Thanks for everything, Conni.
Nice to meet you.

1:14:26.568 --> 1:14:28.103
It's party time!

1:14:28.137 --> 1:14:31.006
Yay!

1:14:40.883 --> 1:14:44.487
Semire! That's beautiful!

1:14:47.189 --> 1:14:48.959
Hurray!

1:14:56.432 --> 1:14:58.268
