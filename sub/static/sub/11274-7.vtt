SAM: Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:05.255 --> 00:07.090
Why don't you wait? I'll get our coats.

00:07.090 --> 00:08.591
Mm. Okay?

00:09.592 --> 00:11.594
Hope to see you again soon.

00:11.594 --> 00:12.595
Thank you, Miss.

00:12.595 --> 00:14.597
Oh, great.

00:15.098 --> 00:17.100
I can't even read that check.

00:18.601 --> 00:21.604
Well, I'm so sorry if my handwriting

00:21.604 --> 00:24.107
isn't up to your high
and mighty standards,

00:24.107 --> 00:25.608
but some of us don't get to sit around

00:25.608 --> 00:28.611
on our buns all day and
practice our penmanship.

00:28.611 --> 00:29.479
Some of us

00:29.479 --> 00:30.864
have to go out and earn a living!

00:30.864 --> 00:32.232
Here are your glasses, dear.

00:32.232 --> 00:33.616
You left them in your coat again.

00:33.616 --> 00:34.617
Oh, thanks.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.487
What's wrong?

00:37.487 --> 00:38.988
Nothing.

00:40.490 --> 00:41.491
Let's go.

00:41.491 --> 00:44.994
Oh, hey, um... I'm really sorry.

00:44.994 --> 00:45.995
I-I...

00:45.995 --> 00:50.383
I don't know what to say,
except I had a really bad day.

00:51.668 --> 00:56.556
Oh... yeah, sure, Carla, bad day.

00:56.556 --> 00:58.391
Bad life is more like it.

00:58.391 --> 01:01.311
House full of kids, this crummy job.

01:01.311 --> 01:03.313
If I keep treatin'
my customers this way,

01:03.313 --> 01:05.065
I'm going to lose even that.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.901
Uh, uh, here you go.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.402
I hope things'll start looking up.

01:09.402 --> 01:11.404
Oh, no, no, no, no, I
couldn't, I couldn't.

01:11.404 --> 01:12.405
Not the way I treated you.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.908
No, please, please, please, we insist.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.910
(sighs)

01:20.413 --> 01:23.416
Ten bucks?

01:25.502 --> 01:26.503
Excuse me, Miss.

01:26.503 --> 01:28.505
You forgot to, uh, give me a napkin.

01:31.007 --> 01:34.511
I'm so sorry!

01:34.511 --> 01:36.513
I don't know what to say,

01:36.513 --> 01:40.016
except I've had a really bad day.

01:41.017 --> 01:44.521
Bad day? Bad life is more like it.

01:44.521 --> 01:45.522
A house full of kids...

01:46.022 --> 01:49.893
(piano plays)

01:49.893 --> 01:52.312
? Making your way in the world today ?

01:52.312 --> 01:55.315
? Takes everything you've got ?

01:55.315 --> 01:57.817
? Taking a break from all your worries ?

01:57.817 --> 02:01.321
? Sure would help a lot ?

02:01.321 --> 02:07.243
? Wouldn't you like to get away? ?

02:07.243 --> 02:09.245
? Sometimes you want to go ?

02:09.245 --> 02:14.751
? Where everybody knows your name ?

02:14.751 --> 02:19.255
? And they're always glad you came ?

02:19.255 --> 02:21.758
? You want to be where you can see ?

02:21.758 --> 02:24.260
? Our troubles are all the same ?

02:24.260 --> 02:29.766
? You want to be where
everybody knows your name ?

02:29.766 --> 02:32.268
? You want to go where people know ?

02:32.268 --> 02:34.771
? People are all the same ?

02:34.771 --> 02:39.275
? You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ?

02:57.293 --> 03:00.296
Yep! Hey, everybody, guess what?

03:00.296 --> 03:02.799
Today marks the beginning
of my seventh year

03:02.799 --> 03:04.801
as a U.S. postal carrier.

03:05.301 --> 03:06.302
Well, all right.

03:06.302 --> 03:08.304
Woody, I think that calls for
a little drink on the house.

03:08.304 --> 03:09.305
What do you think, huh?

03:09.305 --> 03:10.557
I think you're right, Mr. Peterson.

03:10.557 --> 03:12.392
Yeah? Hey, what the hell,
give Cliffie one, too.

03:12.392 --> 03:13.393
Hey...

03:13.393 --> 03:14.894
This guy, huh?

03:14.894 --> 03:17.897
Oh, yeah, imagine that.

03:17.897 --> 03:19.899
Seven years carrying the old bag around.

03:19.899 --> 03:20.900
(snorts)

03:20.900 --> 03:22.902
Yeah, I know the feeling.

03:23.820 --> 03:24.821
That's, uh...

03:24.821 --> 03:26.706
that's quite an
achievement, though, Cliffie.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.208
Oh, yeah? Look who's talkin'.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.210
Oh, okay, all right.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.712
I know some people around
here don't exactly think

03:32.712 --> 03:35.715
that I'm an overachiever,
but, uh... I'll tell you,

03:35.715 --> 03:37.217
I don't plan to go to my grave

03:37.217 --> 03:39.719
until I've made some sort
of impression on this world.

03:39.719 --> 03:42.972
I'd say you've already made a deep one.

03:42.972 --> 03:44.257
You know,

03:44.257 --> 03:46.259
I plan on leavin' somethin' behind

03:46.259 --> 03:48.261
for the world to remember me by.

03:48.261 --> 03:49.762
Yeah?

03:49.762 --> 03:51.264
And here it is.

03:51.264 --> 03:52.765
(sighs)

03:52.765 --> 03:55.768
It's a glass of Windex, Woody.

03:56.769 --> 03:58.771
No, it's a drink.

03:58.771 --> 04:01.658
And Woody Boyd is going to
become the next Jim Sheehan.

04:01.658 --> 04:02.942
Who?

04:02.942 --> 04:04.444
Certainly you've heard of the inventor

04:04.444 --> 04:05.828
of the Fish House Punch?

04:05.828 --> 04:06.829
I can't say we have,

04:06.829 --> 04:07.830
Wood, but then again,

04:07.830 --> 04:10.199
we don't get out that much, you know?

04:10.199 --> 04:12.619
Well, I'm callin' mine
the Blue Boyd of Happiness.

04:12.619 --> 04:15.121
Can I tempt you?

04:21.628 --> 04:23.129
Not bad.

04:23.129 --> 04:24.631
Really.

04:27.133 --> 04:29.636
Oh, hey, that's delicious.

04:29.636 --> 04:32.138
Now all I got to do
is fill out these forms

04:32.138 --> 04:34.641
and register with
Bartender's Monthly Magazine,

04:34.641 --> 04:37.143
and my name will be a household word.

04:37.143 --> 04:39.646
Yeah: doorknob.

04:39.646 --> 04:41.648
Hey, Sam, you want to try my new drink?

04:42.148 --> 04:43.149
Woody, I can't touch that stuff.

04:43.650 --> 04:44.651
I'm an alcoholic.

04:44.651 --> 04:46.536
You are?

04:46.536 --> 04:48.905
Oh, I... I'm sorry.
I-I thought you knew.

04:48.905 --> 04:51.908
Yeah, I drank myself out of
baseball and out of a marriage.

04:51.908 --> 04:53.910
Gee, that's hard to believe.

04:53.910 --> 04:55.795
Well, it's true. Right, gang?

04:55.795 --> 04:57.797
Yeah... Guy had a face full of booze...

04:58.798 --> 05:00.300
No, no, no, I believe

05:00.300 --> 05:01.301
you were a drunk, Sam.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.169
I just didn't know you'd been married.

05:06.973 --> 05:08.841
Mmm, pretty good Blue Moon.

05:08.841 --> 05:10.310
You mean it's already a drink?

05:10.310 --> 05:12.312
Aw, don't feel
disappointed there, Woody.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.814
Every combination in the world's
been done to death by now.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.316
You couldn't possibly
invent anything new.

05:16.816 --> 05:17.317
(phone rings)

05:17.817 --> 05:18.818
DIANE: Hello, Cheers.

05:18.818 --> 05:19.819
Hey, Woody, gin and tonic.

05:19.819 --> 05:22.238
Oh, uh, somebody's
already invented that.

05:23.690 --> 05:26.693
No, you horseshoe, I'm ordering one.

05:28.194 --> 05:30.697
Oh, no! Really?

05:30.697 --> 05:33.199
Tonight? Oh!

05:33.199 --> 05:34.701
Oh, I can't wait!

05:34.701 --> 05:36.703
Yes, thank you.

05:36.703 --> 05:40.206
Oh! I have the most
exciting news, everyone.

05:40.206 --> 05:43.209
Tonight I am eating dinner at The Cafe.

05:43.209 --> 05:45.712
Ah, gee, that's pretty exciting.

05:45.712 --> 05:48.214
Tonight I'm driving home in The Car.

05:51.217 --> 05:53.720
No, you see, um... actually, Sam,

05:53.720 --> 05:56.723
The Cafe is one of the
trendiest restaurants.

05:56.723 --> 05:59.192
Eating there is considered,
uh, to be rather a coup

05:59.192 --> 06:00.693
among certain, oh...

06:00.693 --> 06:02.695
self-important and pretentious circles.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.564
Congratulations, Diane.

06:06.315 --> 06:08.317
If this place is so hot,
how come they can't think

06:08.317 --> 06:10.820
of a better name than The Cafe?

06:10.820 --> 06:12.822
Oh, Carla, if you had
any sense of style,

06:12.822 --> 06:14.824
you would know that
a simple name connotes

06:14.824 --> 06:16.826
the very best of taste.

06:16.826 --> 06:18.327
Hey, you're right about that, Diane.

06:18.327 --> 06:20.329
There's this joint out
on Route One called "Eat".

06:22.331 --> 06:24.333
Don't miss it. It's great.

06:25.835 --> 06:27.837
Say, you know, Darlene and
I can't make up our mind

06:28.337 --> 06:30.840
whether to have some
chili or a hamburger.

06:30.840 --> 06:32.842
Maybe this Cafe joint
sounds just like the ticket.

06:32.842 --> 06:34.343
Well, you got the number there?

06:34.343 --> 06:36.345
(laughing)

06:36.345 --> 06:38.848
What? What's the number? What?

06:38.848 --> 06:41.350
Pardonne mon laughteur, Sam.

06:41.350 --> 06:43.352
This is not the sort of place

06:43.352 --> 06:45.855
you just call and make a reservation.

06:45.855 --> 06:48.357
My dinner companion is a Brundage,

06:48.357 --> 06:49.358
and even with that pull,

06:49.358 --> 06:51.360
he had to wait three months for a table.

06:51.360 --> 06:54.864
Ooh, geez, I wonder how long
he had to wait for the chairs.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.834
Look what I'm dealing with.

06:58.334 --> 07:00.336
You consider food as a fuel

07:00.336 --> 07:02.338
to be salted down heavily,

07:02.338 --> 07:03.840
covered with ketchup,

07:03.840 --> 07:05.341
stuffed in your mouth,

07:05.341 --> 07:07.343
and on a good day, chewed.

07:09.212 --> 07:11.180
What I'm trying to say is, Sam,

07:11.180 --> 07:13.683
you couldn't possibly get a
reservation at this late hour.

07:13.683 --> 07:18.688
Diane, I can get a reservation
in any restaurant I want.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.189
The name "Sam Malone"

07:20.189 --> 07:23.192
still carries a little
clout in this town.

07:23.192 --> 07:24.193
Right. Hey, hey, hey.

07:24.193 --> 07:25.695
Very well, Sam.

07:25.695 --> 07:26.696
Let's give it a try.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.698
Allow me to call The Cafe.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.199
Well, now, li-lis...

07:30.199 --> 07:32.201
I'm not even sure I want to go there.

07:32.201 --> 07:33.486
Afraid, Sam?

07:33.486 --> 07:37.406
They have not built the
restaurant that can scare me.

07:37.406 --> 07:39.909
Come on. Um, yes, hold on, please.

07:41.410 --> 07:45.414
Um, hello, uh, I'd like to
make a reservation, please.

07:45.414 --> 07:46.666
Nothing tonight?

07:47.967 --> 07:50.386
Well, this happens to
be Sam "Mayday" Malone,

07:50.386 --> 07:53.389
formerly of the Red Sox.

07:53.389 --> 07:55.391
Well, yeah, that'll be fine.

07:55.391 --> 07:57.677
8:00? Well, let's say 8:00.

07:57.677 --> 07:59.562
Thank you very much.

08:00.062 --> 08:02.064
Hey, all right, Sammy. You got it, huh?

08:03.483 --> 08:04.984
Sure did.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.352
When, next March?

08:06.352 --> 08:08.771
No, next February.

08:10.273 --> 08:12.775
Well done, Sam.

08:13.776 --> 08:16.279
God, I hate it when she's right.

08:16.279 --> 08:18.781
Ah, you didn't want to
eat there anyway, Sam.

08:18.781 --> 08:20.783
The waiters pride
themselves on rudeness,

08:20.783 --> 08:23.786
the portions are too small, and
it's exorbitantly overpriced.

08:23.786 --> 08:25.288
Oh, you couldn't get in either, huh?

08:25.288 --> 08:27.290
Not till April.

08:27.290 --> 08:30.760
Well, I certainly hope
Diane had a big lunch.

08:31.761 --> 08:34.764
Hi, I'd like to, uh,
cancel a reservation

08:34.764 --> 08:35.765
for tonight, please.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.265
The name is Brundage.

08:37.265 --> 08:39.268
Party of two.

08:39.268 --> 08:40.770
Yes, that Brundage.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.272
Thank you.

08:43.272 --> 08:45.107
Uh-uh,
uh-uh, Sammy.

08:45.107 --> 08:46.559
Canceling Diane's reservation?

08:46.559 --> 08:48.561
CLIFF: Ooh, heart of stone.

08:48.561 --> 08:49.562
I love it.

08:49.562 --> 08:51.564
Yeah, hi, this is, uh, Sam Malone again.

08:51.564 --> 08:53.566
I'm just wondering if you might've had

08:53.566 --> 08:56.068
a surprise cancellation for tonight.

08:56.068 --> 08:57.570
What do you mean, you don't?

08:57.570 --> 08:59.572
You must have. I just...

08:59.572 --> 09:01.574
No, no, n-never mind, never mind.

09:01.574 --> 09:03.993
Boy, I'd sure love to waltz

09:03.993 --> 09:05.494
into that joint tonight

09:05.494 --> 09:07.997
just so I could see
the look on her face.

09:07.997 --> 09:10.917
Well, if it's that important
to you, Sam, give me the phone.

09:11.918 --> 09:14.420
If Julian Weinstein, my good friend,

09:14.420 --> 09:15.421
can't get you in, nobody can.

09:15.421 --> 09:16.923
Ooh, the heart transplant wizard?

09:16.923 --> 09:19.425
Oh, one and the same, yeah. We
went to prep school together.

09:20.426 --> 09:22.929
He's a well-known gourmet.

09:22.929 --> 09:24.931
Yeah, well, wh-why would he
want to do this for me, though?

09:24.931 --> 09:26.432
He'd love to do me a favor.

09:26.933 --> 09:28.434
See, we dissected our
first frog together.

09:29.936 --> 09:32.438
Hello, Julian. Julian, hi.

09:32.438 --> 09:35.408
Frasier Crane. How are you?

09:35.408 --> 09:36.409
Crane.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.913
C-R-A-N-E.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.834
Yes, yes, Dr. Frasier
Crane. All right, fine.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.336
Uh, listen, I was wondering
what you know about, uh...

09:47.336 --> 09:50.339
No, it's A-N-E!
Oh, skip it!

09:51.841 --> 09:53.843
I'll tell you, you know,
you open a few thoraxes,

09:53.843 --> 09:55.845
you forget who your friends are.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.936
Oh, it's beautiful.

10:03.936 --> 10:06.939
A feast for the eyes
as well as the palate.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.441
Ah, that must be our table.

10:08.441 --> 10:11.444
Uh, the Brundage party.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.815
Brundage?

10:15.815 --> 10:18.567
Ah, Brundage.

10:18.567 --> 10:19.952
You canceled.

10:19.952 --> 10:20.903
(laughs)

10:20.903 --> 10:22.405
That's impossible.

10:22.405 --> 10:23.406
I-I made the reservations

10:23.406 --> 10:24.407
over three months ago.

10:24.407 --> 10:26.409
Well, obviously, there's
been some mistake.

10:26.409 --> 10:29.295
The best we can do is give
you the next available table.

10:29.295 --> 10:30.997
And when might that be?

10:30.997 --> 10:34.884
If all goes well, perhaps... tonight.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.386
Perhaps?

10:37.386 --> 10:39.805
Jordan, don't make a fuss, please.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.307
We'll straighten this out.

10:41.307 --> 10:42.308
He's sorry.

10:42.308 --> 10:43.809
(laughs)

10:45.811 --> 10:48.814
Dr. Weinstein, your table is ready.

10:49.815 --> 10:51.317
Excuse me, Miss.

11:02.745 --> 11:05.247
I don't believe it.

11:05.247 --> 11:06.248
Oh, neither do I.

11:06.248 --> 11:09.251
I was this close to
Dr. Julian Weinstein.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.755
That's not Julian Weinstein.

11:12.755 --> 11:15.758
That's the man who
stole our reservation.

11:15.758 --> 11:18.260
That's not Julian Weinstein.

11:18.260 --> 11:19.762
That's an imposter.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.764
Ask him for his I.D.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.766
Ask him to spell I.D.

11:26.152 --> 11:28.571
Do you know how to order
in a place like this?

11:28.571 --> 11:31.073
Oh, yeah, yeah, my, uh, friend Frasier

11:31.073 --> 11:32.575
read a review about the menu.

11:32.575 --> 11:34.076
He coached me.

11:34.076 --> 11:35.077
No problem.

11:35.077 --> 11:37.580
Dr. Weinstein.

11:37.580 --> 11:38.581
Uh-uh,
uh-uh.

11:38.581 --> 11:41.083
You swine.

11:41.083 --> 11:42.451
It's one thing to pretend

11:42.451 --> 11:44.253
to be somebody else on the phone,

11:44.253 --> 11:46.756
but convincing others that
you're a sophisticated gourmet

11:46.756 --> 11:48.758
is a little bit more
than you can handle.

11:48.758 --> 11:50.259
You're going to blow it, Sam.

11:50.259 --> 11:52.261
You're going to be
embarrassed in front of some

11:52.261 --> 11:53.763
of the most important people in Boston.

11:53.763 --> 11:55.715
And then you're going
to slink out of here

11:55.715 --> 11:58.217
with your curly little
swine tail between your legs.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.722
You don't think I can handle this?

12:02.722 --> 12:03.723
Well, just watch.

12:03.723 --> 12:04.724
Excuse me, we'd like to start off

12:04.724 --> 12:07.226
with Bouchées Parmentier au Fromage,

12:07.727 --> 12:08.728
followed by a salade maison,

12:08.728 --> 12:09.612
and for our entrée,

12:09.612 --> 12:12.481
we'll have Tourte Froide
D'Anguille Rabelais.

12:12.481 --> 12:13.983
Thank you so much.

12:15.484 --> 12:17.987
Good, Sam; that was your busboy.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.492
I knew that.

12:23.492 --> 12:24.493
He's got lips.

12:24.493 --> 12:26.495
He can tell the waiter, can't he?

12:26.495 --> 12:29.999
Bon appetit, Dr. Weinstein.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.003
Who's Miss Grumpus?

12:34.003 --> 12:39.508
Excuse me, uh, you aren't, uh,
Dr. Julian Weinstein, are you?

12:41.510 --> 12:43.012
Uh... yes.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.513
(chuckles softly)

12:44.513 --> 12:46.015
This is really an honor.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.516
I'm, I'm Dr. Peter Fisher.

12:47.516 --> 12:49.518
Oh.

12:49.518 --> 12:51.020
Uh, nice to meet you.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.522
Yeah. You know, I had no
idea you were so young.

12:53.522 --> 12:58.027
Well, I, uh, skipped a
few grades in med school.

12:59.495 --> 13:00.996
(laughing)

13:00.996 --> 13:04.500
You got to have a sense of
humor in this line of work.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.001
Say, if you'll indulge
in a little shop talk,

13:06.001 --> 13:08.504
uh, where did you come
up with that concept

13:08.504 --> 13:10.506
of combining antithymocyte globulin

13:10.506 --> 13:14.009
with, uh, cyclosporin A
to combat tissue rejection?

13:15.511 --> 13:18.514
On the beach.

13:22.017 --> 13:24.520
(uncomfortable chuckle)

13:24.520 --> 13:26.522
Nice meeting you.

13:26.522 --> 13:27.523
Excuse me, Dr. Weinstein.

13:27.523 --> 13:28.524
Oh, uh, yeah, here we go.

13:28.524 --> 13:30.025
Our chef Claude would like to say hello.

13:30.025 --> 13:31.527
He met you while he
was a chef at La Ronde.

13:32.027 --> 13:32.828
Do you mind?

13:33.028 --> 13:36.031
Oh, uh... well, actu-actually...

13:36.031 --> 13:37.032
It won't take but a moment.

13:37.533 --> 13:38.534
Maybe, uh... Grab your purse.

13:38.534 --> 13:39.535
We've got to get...

13:39.535 --> 13:42.037
Dr. Weinstein, so good...

13:42.037 --> 13:44.540
You're not Dr. Weinstein.

13:44.540 --> 13:45.541
Yes, I am.

13:47.910 --> 13:51.997
Perhaps you hadn't
heard about my accident.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.833
Why, no, I didn't.

13:53.833 --> 13:57.219
Oh, yes, yes, uh... terribly disfigured.

13:57.219 --> 14:00.222
Uh, thank God for plastic surgery.

14:00.222 --> 14:01.423
Oh, I'm so sorry.

14:01.423 --> 14:02.758
But they've done a wonderful job.

14:02.758 --> 14:03.759
Hmm...

14:03.759 --> 14:05.644
You look much better.

14:05.644 --> 14:07.813
And taller.

14:09.682 --> 14:12.067
Traction. It, uh...

14:15.104 --> 14:16.939
Well, nice to see you again.

14:16.939 --> 14:17.940
You, too.

14:21.944 --> 14:22.945
Boy, you pulled it off.

14:22.945 --> 14:24.446
Mm. That's pretty smart.

14:24.446 --> 14:25.447
Yeah, well, of course I'm smart.

14:25.447 --> 14:26.448
I'm a doctor.

14:26.448 --> 14:29.451
(laughing): Oh! Right.

14:35.341 --> 14:38.677
All right, whiskey,
vermouth, bitters--

14:38.677 --> 14:40.679
that's a Paddy Cocktail.

14:40.679 --> 14:44.049
Gin, vermouth,
grapefruit juice--

14:44.049 --> 14:45.434
that's a Palm Beach.

14:46.685 --> 14:48.520
Oh, wait a minute.

14:48.520 --> 14:52.024
How about gin, vermouth
and black coffee?

14:53.893 --> 14:57.730
That's paint remover.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.983
All right, I'll try something else.

15:00.983 --> 15:02.785
Oh, great, I'm out of limes.

15:02.785 --> 15:04.286
Don't panic.

15:04.286 --> 15:05.788
Sam always keeps some extras around.

15:05.788 --> 15:06.655
Where?

15:06.655 --> 15:08.574
Call the doctor

15:08.574 --> 15:10.075
and find out.

15:18.634 --> 15:20.920
Telephone for Dr. Weinstein.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.922
Oh, um...

15:22.922 --> 15:24.306
It's a Dr. Woody.

15:29.228 --> 15:30.729
He's in the middle of surgery,

15:30.729 --> 15:32.231
and he says he needs your opinion.

15:32.231 --> 15:34.233
Thank you.

15:34.233 --> 15:36.235
Hello?

15:36.235 --> 15:38.737
Wha-what? You're out of them?

15:38.737 --> 15:41.740
No, look, just, just check in the box

15:41.740 --> 15:43.742
right next to the scotch...

15:46.779 --> 15:48.280
...uh, tape.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.281
The scotch tape.

15:49.281 --> 15:50.783
We, uh...

15:50.783 --> 15:52.284
Sometimes we run out of stitches

15:52.284 --> 15:53.786
and have to improvise.

15:57.039 --> 15:59.541
Thank you, Dr. Woody.

16:04.546 --> 16:07.049
Dr. Weinstein?

16:07.049 --> 16:09.051
My date needs medical attention.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.552
Can you help?

16:10.552 --> 16:12.805
My food just arrived.

16:14.606 --> 16:15.607
Well, I'm a doctor.

16:15.607 --> 16:17.609
Sit down.

16:17.609 --> 16:20.112
I-I want the world-famous
heart surgeon,

16:20.112 --> 16:21.113
Dr. Julian Weinstein.

16:21.113 --> 16:23.115
Well, of course; I bow
to his greater skill.

16:23.115 --> 16:23.983
No, no, no, uh,

16:24.366 --> 16:26.452
why don't you go ahead there,
Fisher, and give him a shot?

16:28.454 --> 16:30.205
He's having chest pains, Doctor!

16:30.406 --> 16:32.491
Oh, well, uh, why don't you time them

16:32.491 --> 16:34.376
and see how far apart they are?

16:39.465 --> 16:42.384
All right, I'll, uh, give
him a look-see, I guess.

16:42.384 --> 16:43.886
Right this way, Doctor.

16:43.886 --> 16:45.888
Everything'll be all right. Don't worry.

16:48.390 --> 16:49.391
What are you doing?

16:49.391 --> 16:50.893
You're ruining my dinner.

16:50.893 --> 16:52.895
Ruining your dinner?

16:52.895 --> 16:54.897
Ruining your dinner?!

16:54.897 --> 16:56.899
Everybody, now...

16:58.901 --> 17:01.904
Sam, this is the cruelest
thing you've ever done!

17:01.904 --> 17:03.405
Yeah, what about the crummy thing

17:03.405 --> 17:04.406
you did to me earlier today,

17:04.906 --> 17:05.907
making me feel like a big nobody?

17:09.912 --> 17:11.914
I apologize.

17:11.914 --> 17:13.415
I spoke irrationally.

17:13.415 --> 17:15.416
You're not a nobody.

17:15.416 --> 17:16.417
(sighs)

17:16.417 --> 17:17.419
Now, will you

17:17.419 --> 17:18.921
and your date kindly leave

17:18.921 --> 17:20.923
so that Jordan and I can
have our rightful meal,

17:20.923 --> 17:23.425
and the two of you can
sashay over to the Colonel's

17:23.425 --> 17:24.926
across the street?

17:26.929 --> 17:28.430
Will you excuse me?

17:28.430 --> 17:30.299
My meal is getting cold.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.267
Now...

17:37.773 --> 17:40.275
Well, we may have a
long wait ahead of us,

17:40.275 --> 17:45.280
but we are going to
stay until we get seated.

17:45.280 --> 17:47.783
No, you're going to
stay until you get seated.

17:47.783 --> 17:51.286
Right about now a bucket of extra
crispy doesn't sound half bad.

17:57.626 --> 18:02.081
Okay, Dr. Crane, just drink up.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.583
Woody, please, you promised you'd stop

18:04.583 --> 18:06.085
after the rum and trail mix.

18:09.388 --> 18:10.672
That wasn't a drink.

18:10.672 --> 18:12.674
That was just something
to cleanse your palate.

18:12.674 --> 18:15.177
Now come on, here.

18:16.178 --> 18:18.680
My God, Woody!

18:18.680 --> 18:19.681
That bad, huh?

18:19.681 --> 18:21.683
No, no, it's terrific.

18:21.683 --> 18:22.684
Here, try this.

18:22.684 --> 18:25.187
I've never had anything like it.

18:28.073 --> 18:29.441
All right!

18:29.441 --> 18:31.193
Oh!

18:31.193 --> 18:32.694
Oh, yeah!

18:32.694 --> 18:34.163
This one gets you

18:34.163 --> 18:35.914
in the cocktail hall of fame!

18:38.000 --> 18:39.334
So, what's in it, Wood?

18:39.334 --> 18:40.202
Yeah, what's the secret recipe?

18:40.202 --> 18:42.671
Well, it's, uh, two parts...

18:48.260 --> 18:49.628
(crying)

18:55.134 --> 18:57.603
Your change, Dr. Weinstein.

18:57.603 --> 18:59.605
Ah, thank you very much.

19:04.109 --> 19:07.112
Whew, boy, remember the good old days

19:07.112 --> 19:10.115
when you could spend $200 for a meal

19:10.115 --> 19:12.618
and then still have enough change

19:12.618 --> 19:14.620
to buy a mint patty?

19:16.622 --> 19:19.124
Ah, Paul, memorable.

19:21.627 --> 19:23.629
Aw, gee...

19:25.130 --> 19:26.498
(cries out)

19:28.467 --> 19:29.468
Madam, we've had our last seating.

19:29.468 --> 19:32.387
I'm afraid we won't be able to
accommodate you this evening.

19:32.387 --> 19:34.890
Oh, Paul, uh... could I
speak to you for a minute?

19:34.890 --> 19:36.892
I'll meet you outside.

19:36.892 --> 19:40.896
Listen, it, it would be a
great personal favor to me,

19:40.896 --> 19:42.397
Dr. Julian
Weinstein--

19:42.397 --> 19:45.400
in fact, to the entire Weinstein family,

19:45.400 --> 19:48.904
and pretty much to doctors
all over the world-- if...

19:48.904 --> 19:52.274
if you could, uh, make
sure she gets some food.

19:53.108 --> 19:56.612
Well, uh, if you'll agree to honor us

19:56.612 --> 19:58.614
with your presence again, Dr. Weinstein,

19:58.614 --> 20:00.032
I'll see to it personally.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.283
SAM: Well, I appreciate that.

20:01.283 --> 20:02.618
Enjoy, Diane.

20:02.618 --> 20:05.120
Thank you. I intend to.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.677
Thank you. This will do nicely.

20:15.180 --> 20:17.683
Would you like to hear our menu?

20:17.683 --> 20:19.184
Thank you, no.

20:19.184 --> 20:20.686
I've memorized it.

20:22.187 --> 20:24.556
I'll have the Tournedos Rossini.

20:24.556 --> 20:27.559
I'm sorry, we're all out of that.

20:27.559 --> 20:32.864
Uh, then I'll have the
Jambon Farci et Braise.

20:32.864 --> 20:34.366
Once again, I'm sorry.

20:34.366 --> 20:38.070
Let's attack this
from another direction.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.956
You tell me what you have left.

20:40.956 --> 20:42.741
Fricadelles de veau a la Nicoise.

20:42.741 --> 20:46.128
Great, I'm in a Fricadelle mood.

20:53.218 --> 20:54.720
Hi.

20:54.720 --> 20:57.723
What are you doing here?

20:57.723 --> 20:59.591
Well, I'm still hungry, actually.

20:59.591 --> 21:02.894
What happened to, uh, Darlene?

21:02.894 --> 21:05.230
Oh, I put her in a
cab and sent her home.

21:05.230 --> 21:08.517
Well, you don't have
to do me any favors.

21:08.517 --> 21:09.985
No, I'm not doing you any favors.

21:09.985 --> 21:10.986
I-I'm really hungry.

21:10.986 --> 21:12.404
May I, uh,

21:12.404 --> 21:14.406
join you?

21:14.406 --> 21:15.907
I don't care what you do.

21:16.408 --> 21:17.909
Well, thank you.

21:22.914 --> 21:25.117
Thank you, Sam.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.918
You're welcome.

21:28.370 --> 21:29.755
Doctor. Ah, Paul.

21:29.755 --> 21:31.256
Can I get you anything else?

21:31.256 --> 21:33.125
Uh, what do you have?

21:33.125 --> 21:35.594
Anything for you, Dr. Weinstein.

21:35.594 --> 21:36.595
Ah, well...

21:38.597 --> 21:40.098
You know, I just can't make up my mind.

21:40.098 --> 21:42.100
Why don't you have my dear friend Claude

21:42.100 --> 21:43.101
mix me up something special?

21:43.602 --> 21:44.102
Very good.

21:45.103 --> 21:46.104
(chuckling)

21:49.107 --> 21:52.110
I really do appreciate
your coming back, Sam.

21:52.110 --> 21:53.612
It was sweet.

21:53.612 --> 21:55.113
No, no, it's not sweet.

21:55.614 --> 21:57.115
I... I did it for myself.

21:57.115 --> 21:58.116
I was feeling guilty out there,

21:58.116 --> 21:59.618
and I don't like to feel guilty.

21:59.618 --> 22:01.620
Well, that's sweet in itself.

22:01.620 --> 22:03.121
Well, we'll see how
sweet you think it is

22:03.622 --> 22:05.123
when I have you pay for your own meal.

22:12.631 --> 22:15.133
Madam. Doctor.

22:15.133 --> 22:20.138
Everything was delightful
and well worth the wait.

22:20.138 --> 22:22.140
Ooh, yes, I enjoyed it very much.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.688
I'll be right with you.

22:36.688 --> 22:40.192
Say, uh, I seem to be running
a little short on cash.

22:40.192 --> 22:43.695
You know, Sam, I think it
was a really good idea you had

22:43.695 --> 22:45.080
about us going Dutch.

22:45.080 --> 22:46.832
See, this way, we don't feel

22:46.832 --> 22:48.333
that we owe each other anything.

22:48.333 --> 22:49.835
This is not funny.

22:49.835 --> 22:52.838
This could be very embarrassing
for both of us. Please.

22:52.838 --> 22:55.841
Why? I've already paid for
my meal, and I'm leaving.

22:58.710 --> 23:00.011
Good night, Dr. Weinstein.

23:00.011 --> 23:00.879
See you in surgery.

23:00.879 --> 23:02.347
Hey, I'm serious.

23:02.347 --> 23:03.348
Hey, come on, don't do this!

23:03.849 --> 23:05.350
MAITRE D': Is there a problem, Doctor?

23:06.852 --> 23:09.855
No, no, no problem at all. Um...

23:09.855 --> 23:12.357
I'll just use my credit card here.

23:12.357 --> 23:13.859
Mm, very well.

23:15.861 --> 23:18.864
Uh, Dr. Weinstein, this appears to be

23:18.864 --> 23:21.366
the credit card of a Mr. Sam Malone.

23:21.366 --> 23:23.368
Let me see that.

23:23.368 --> 23:25.871
Well, I'll be darned.

23:25.871 --> 23:27.873
You know, I must have,
uh, switched wallets

23:27.873 --> 23:29.374
with this Malone character.

23:29.374 --> 23:31.376
You know, I bet it happened at the club.

23:31.877 --> 23:33.378
Yes, it did; I remember him now.

23:33.378 --> 23:35.881
A baseball player. Malone.

23:35.881 --> 23:38.383
You, uh, you ever heard of him?

23:38.383 --> 23:40.886
No.

23:41.386 --> 23:44.389
Oh, well, why don't you, uh, put it on

23:44.389 --> 23:46.892
this credit card anyway,
and I'll take this Malone guy

23:46.892 --> 23:48.393
out to dinner some other time, hmm?

23:48.393 --> 23:49.895
I'm afraid not.

23:49.895 --> 23:51.396
Well, all right, I don't suppose

23:51.396 --> 23:53.398
you take a personal check, do you?

23:53.398 --> 23:55.901
And whose name would be on that?

23:55.901 --> 23:58.904
Okay, well, uh, why
don't we try this, then?

23:58.904 --> 24:00.772
Oh, my God, look at
the size of that cat!

24:00.772 --> 24:04.025
Hey, you, come back here!
