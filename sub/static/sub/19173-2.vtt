WEBVTT

00:16.016 --> 00:18.352
They
obstructed the harbor.
I know.

00:18.452 --> 00:20.554
Two ships they sunk.
I know, I--

00:20.654 --> 00:22.923
Then why didn't you warn us?
I did warn you!

00:23.023 --> 00:24.992
We don't have
sufficient numbers
to move on Nassau,

00:25.093 --> 00:27.061
but if we could increase
those numbers...

00:27.161 --> 00:29.197
Increase them how?
The Underhill plantation.

00:29.297 --> 00:31.399
Captured nine more
just east of the fence line.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.667
I want the trial started
as soon as possible.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.569
What did he do?

00:35.669 --> 00:38.172
Set a course
for Nassau to send
a message when we return.

00:38.272 --> 00:41.575
When I informed Sarah
of my intent to formally
end our marriage,

00:41.675 --> 00:43.677
her family persuaded
my old creditors

00:43.777 --> 00:45.913
to accelerate
my timetables
for repayment.

00:46.114 --> 00:47.815
I would default.

00:47.915 --> 00:49.950
Three men know the resting
place of the chest,

00:50.184 --> 00:51.219
and one woman.

00:51.319 --> 00:52.986
He told it to me
before we left home.

00:53.087 --> 00:55.356
There will be
no pirate king here.

00:55.456 --> 00:57.425
Of that much
I am certain.

01:00.194 --> 01:02.730
Long John Silver.
Welcome home.

04:05.479 --> 04:07.315
What is this?

04:12.653 --> 04:14.955
I said,
what's going on here?

04:15.055 --> 04:16.690
What do you want from me?

04:55.996 --> 04:58.499
Blacksmith pays for these.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.739
Jeweler pays for these.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.911
The law pays for you.

05:13.080 --> 05:16.684
500 pieces
for Long John Silver.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.454
I'm sorry, I think
you're mistaken.
I'm not--

05:25.393 --> 05:27.495
I seen you. Huh?

05:27.595 --> 05:29.229
Before.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.465
Before you was Long.

05:34.702 --> 05:36.404
Now...

05:38.406 --> 05:41.008
they say you're supposed
to be a pirate king.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.412
A strongman.

05:45.813 --> 05:47.415
That true?

05:51.485 --> 05:52.886
Hmm.

05:54.488 --> 05:55.889
That's what I thought.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.859
More lies.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.232
So,

06:05.466 --> 06:07.435
you returned.

06:07.535 --> 06:08.836
You're angry.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.337
Ah.

06:10.438 --> 06:14.074
And you just killed
one of the governor's men.

06:17.144 --> 06:19.547
Now write that.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.249
I killed who?

06:22.483 --> 06:24.685
Killed him.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.757
What?

06:29.857 --> 06:33.260
500 pieces they pay
before you did it.

06:33.461 --> 06:35.463
I think more after.

06:36.630 --> 06:37.898
Fuck you.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.105
Write.

07:48.602 --> 07:51.004
I am told
it will begin soon.

07:53.607 --> 07:55.543
The executions
of the men

07:55.643 --> 07:58.612
captured on the beach
yesterday.

07:58.712 --> 08:01.181
It's for the best
to have it done.

08:04.117 --> 08:06.019
It could have been you.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.596
I gave you...

08:16.864 --> 08:18.899
both of you,

08:18.999 --> 08:22.102
a place to stand here.

08:22.202 --> 08:25.172
I gave you a life,

08:25.272 --> 08:26.907
and you repaid me

08:27.007 --> 08:29.677
by conspiring
with my enemies.

08:29.777 --> 08:31.712
Ma'am, I don't know
what you think you heard,
but--

08:31.812 --> 08:33.581
Quiet.

08:37.184 --> 08:41.288
I know you were responsible
for Captain Rackham's escape.

08:41.388 --> 08:45.425
I know you solicited her
to aid you in the effort.

08:45.593 --> 08:48.829
I know you relayed information
to the pirate resistance

08:48.929 --> 08:51.298
throughout the purges here.

08:51.398 --> 08:54.868
I have been monitoring
all of it since it began.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.136
Monitoring?

08:56.236 --> 08:59.740
You intercepted
his message.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.609
The warning that was
to alert Captain Flint

09:01.675 --> 09:03.744
of the governor's
obstructing the harbor.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.917
Why aren't we out there?

09:10.017 --> 09:12.319
Why didn't you report us
to Captain Berringer?

09:14.021 --> 09:15.623
Let fall!

09:29.136 --> 09:32.305
The continued pirate threat
makes Captain Berringer

09:32.405 --> 09:35.275
a necessary,
if temporary, evil.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.745
But I do not care
for the idea of having him

09:37.845 --> 09:39.246
trampling through
my affairs,

09:39.346 --> 09:42.215
encouraged by one scandal
to search for more,

09:42.315 --> 09:45.318
which is why
I secured an agreement
from the governor

09:45.418 --> 09:48.521
that my informants
would be held immune
from any prosecution

09:48.656 --> 09:51.759
for their prior associations
with the pirates.

09:55.162 --> 09:58.231
This will all pass
soon enough

09:58.331 --> 09:59.867
if we let it.

10:08.676 --> 10:12.646
My grandfather was a pirate
of another sort.

10:12.746 --> 10:15.315
When he was a young man,
he swindled a ship,

10:15.415 --> 10:17.384
hired it to privateers,

10:17.484 --> 10:20.654
and earned a share
of their spoils
for his trouble.

10:20.754 --> 10:24.191
But he had an ambition
for something far greater
than plunder,

10:24.291 --> 10:27.060
a desire to build
something more permanent.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.629
So, plunder
purchased more ships.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.199
Ships generated
more profits,

10:32.299 --> 10:33.934
profits became wealth,

10:34.034 --> 10:37.104
which became influence,
which became power.

10:38.438 --> 10:40.808
By the time I was born,

10:40.908 --> 10:43.543
my grandfather was
one of the wealthiest men

10:43.744 --> 10:45.278
in the New World.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.186
If I go to him,

10:53.286 --> 10:55.155
if I plead our case
and gain his support,

10:55.255 --> 10:57.057
that might be all we need,
all Nassau needs,

10:57.157 --> 10:59.392
to emerge from this intact.

11:03.296 --> 11:04.965
He could pay my debts?

11:05.065 --> 11:07.935
Several times over, yes.

11:08.035 --> 11:11.138
He could send us ships?

11:11.238 --> 11:13.073
And guns?

11:13.173 --> 11:15.042
And mercenaries?

11:15.142 --> 11:16.944
Yes.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.948
But?

11:21.048 --> 11:22.950
My father
was ill-favored
by his family,

11:23.050 --> 11:24.952
and that was before
he made their name
synonymous

11:25.052 --> 11:27.254
with piracy
in the West Indies.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.356
And all I've done since
is make their name

11:29.456 --> 11:31.358
synonymous with scandal
in London.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.028
It is far from
a foregone conclusion

11:35.128 --> 11:37.965
that they'll be inclined
to offer me their help.

11:40.267 --> 11:42.669
But,

11:42.770 --> 11:44.371
given our state
of affairs,

11:44.471 --> 11:46.239
it seems
more than worth a try.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.177
And unlike
in the past...

11:51.344 --> 11:52.780
I now have something
to offer them

11:52.846 --> 11:55.048
that may make the ask
more attractive.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.786
What's that?

12:00.020 --> 12:01.121
You.

12:02.790 --> 12:05.793
They can purchase ships
and influence and power,

12:05.859 --> 12:08.896
but they cannot purchase
what they ultimately want.

12:08.996 --> 12:11.698
And that is
for the family to be known
within London society

12:11.799 --> 12:14.935
for something more than being
a backwater merchant clan.

12:15.035 --> 12:18.338
Calling you a part of it
certainly wouldn't
hurt matters.

12:25.212 --> 12:26.947
What is it?

12:34.888 --> 12:37.390
Steady, now.

12:40.427 --> 12:43.296
She drifted into the harbor
a little while ago.

12:45.866 --> 12:49.136
A message from Teach
upon his return.

12:50.403 --> 12:54.007
There he intends to sit.

12:54.107 --> 12:57.544
Denying passage
in or out of the bay.

12:57.644 --> 13:02.415
If we cede to his demand,
he will leave.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.017
What demand is that?

13:04.117 --> 13:06.686
That we surrender to him
the woman he holds responsible

13:06.854 --> 13:08.188
for the murder
of Charles Vane.

13:11.859 --> 13:15.328
He also holds 61 more
of my men prisoner
aboard his ship.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.133
If we refuse,

13:20.233 --> 13:23.370
he promises they will
meet the same fate
as these men.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.982
He won't turn her over.

13:35.082 --> 13:37.650
Not for 60 men.

13:37.885 --> 13:39.319
Not for 600 men.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.054
No.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.090
I don't expect
he will.

13:44.892 --> 13:48.228
Nor do we have the stores
to maintain this blockade
for long.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.398
So we need
to move quickly.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.600
You'll gather your men.

13:53.700 --> 13:56.169
You will stand ready
to depart upon nightfall.

13:56.269 --> 13:58.005
And whilst the enemy
remains focused on us,

13:58.105 --> 13:59.907
you will make your landing
to the west

14:00.007 --> 14:02.575
and move undetected
into town.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.978
You will find
Eleanor Guthrie

14:05.078 --> 14:08.248
and you will bring her
out of Nassau, back here.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.952
There ain't
no good way in
from the west.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.658
I agree.
Perhaps an approach
from the lagoon.

14:18.926 --> 14:20.193
Do it.

14:49.756 --> 14:53.126
We depart for the Underhill
plantation on the hour,

14:53.226 --> 14:56.296
arrive just before dark,
approach from the east,

14:56.396 --> 14:58.465
eliminate the overseers,

14:58.565 --> 15:00.467
secure the main house,
and in so doing

15:00.567 --> 15:03.636
establish a camp
capable of Billy's plan.

15:05.205 --> 15:07.207
Your plan.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.442
You will be leading
our forces.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.144
Does that not make it
your plan, too?

15:11.244 --> 15:13.146
What choice do I have?

15:14.314 --> 15:17.384
I must say, it, uh,
caught me by surprise,

15:17.484 --> 15:20.687
your assertion
that Mr. Silver

15:20.787 --> 15:24.992
had revealed
the whereabouts
of the buried cache.

15:25.092 --> 15:27.094
- Assertion?
- Maybe he told you.

15:27.194 --> 15:31.398
Felt close enough to you
to share it, or maybe...

15:31.498 --> 15:34.601
you saw an opportunity

15:34.701 --> 15:37.404
to counter my leverage
with Billy.

15:37.504 --> 15:40.140
And all it took
was a lie

15:40.240 --> 15:43.476
that's terribly
inconvenient to disprove.

15:47.714 --> 15:50.617
And what choice did I have?

15:50.717 --> 15:52.485
The moment we arrived,

15:52.585 --> 15:55.022
it was instantly
clear to me--

15:55.055 --> 15:58.191
he is the one keeping
this place together.

15:58.291 --> 16:02.129
His men look up to him,
rely on him,

16:02.229 --> 16:03.696
trust him.

16:03.796 --> 16:06.699
Many of your men
even trust him, as well.

16:08.835 --> 16:11.738
He is going to be relevant
to what happens next here.

16:11.838 --> 16:15.142
That much
is painfully obvious.

16:15.242 --> 16:18.411
And your first instinct
is to dismiss him.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.113
Had I not stepped in,

16:20.213 --> 16:22.149
who knows how destructive
that could have become

16:22.249 --> 16:23.616
for everyone?

16:55.482 --> 16:58.551
Can't sit still
and let him hold us
hostage.

16:58.651 --> 17:00.187
Can't fight him
directly

17:00.287 --> 17:03.190
or we risk losing
what few soldiers
we have left.

17:03.290 --> 17:05.192
And even if I could
slip a ship past him

17:05.292 --> 17:06.993
to seek aid
from your family
in the colonies,

17:07.094 --> 17:09.096
you'd have to be
on that ship.

17:09.196 --> 17:11.664
And you'd never get that far
before he caught you.

17:11.764 --> 17:14.301
I won't risk that.

17:19.806 --> 17:22.609
All right.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.444
Here's what
we're gonna do.

17:25.612 --> 17:26.913
I board the sloop...

17:27.114 --> 17:28.415
No.
...and I run.

17:28.515 --> 17:29.749
You just said it's too far
to outrun him.

17:29.849 --> 17:31.284
To Philadelphia
it's too far,

17:31.384 --> 17:33.686
but I can make safe harbor
somewhere nearer.

17:33.786 --> 17:35.955
Outrun for a day,
pull him away from here,

17:36.123 --> 17:37.157
then seek shelter
in a friendly port

17:37.257 --> 17:38.491
strong enough
to prevent his entry.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.593
Meanwhile...

17:40.693 --> 17:42.028
the door will be
open for you

17:42.129 --> 17:44.264
to reach your grandfather
and gain his aid.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.402
Why you?

17:49.502 --> 17:51.738
Why not have someone else
lead him away?

17:51.838 --> 17:54.441
Because he won't
leave that position
to chase someone else.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.243
He'd chase you,

17:56.343 --> 17:58.545
and I believe,
given the opportunity,

17:58.645 --> 18:00.180
he might chase me
for a chance

18:00.280 --> 18:02.415
at ending this regime
once and for all.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.588
From where I stand,
it's the only way
out of this.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.828
Insurrection
against the lawfully
appointed governor,

18:15.928 --> 18:18.030
high seas piracy,
treason.

18:18.165 --> 18:21.000
Does the accused
have any words to say

18:21.201 --> 18:23.203
in his own defense?

18:24.504 --> 18:26.539
Fuck... you.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.275
- Oh, get him.
- This is injustice!

18:28.375 --> 18:30.443
Fuck you!

18:30.543 --> 18:31.911
Fuck you!

18:33.580 --> 18:35.415
Gentlemen,
that's enough!

18:35.515 --> 18:37.016
Get out there.
Go on.

18:37.184 --> 18:38.818
Bring in the next man!

18:42.855 --> 18:44.891
It's been like that
all day.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.330
We've condemned
a dozen men since morning.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.332
And between them,

18:52.432 --> 18:56.269
I've yet to see
an ounce of remorse.

18:56.369 --> 18:58.905
Savages
to the bitter end.

19:02.275 --> 19:05.812
When you condemn
a dozen men in as many hours,

19:05.912 --> 19:08.881
perhaps remorse
is a bit much to ask.

19:08.981 --> 19:12.219
You object
to these trials.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.354
I do not object
to trials,

19:14.454 --> 19:16.589
I do not object
to hangings.

19:16.689 --> 19:19.592
What I do object to,
however, is spectacle,

19:19.692 --> 19:21.828
certain to increase
defiance and anger

19:21.928 --> 19:23.830
rather than sooth it.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.333
We should be
moving past this,

19:26.433 --> 19:28.801
not wallowing in it.

19:28.901 --> 19:31.738
That's a very noble
perspective.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.507
And I might share it
were it not for the
soldier of mine

19:34.607 --> 19:37.677
found with his throat
slit this morning...

19:38.811 --> 19:40.780
with a note attached...

19:42.682 --> 19:44.817
threatening that
any further hanging
of pirates

19:44.917 --> 19:46.719
would be met
with more reprisals.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.891
A note attributed

19:51.991 --> 19:54.927
to Long John Silver.

19:56.829 --> 19:59.899
I believe our current war
is far from over.

19:59.999 --> 20:02.602
I believe there are yet
still radicals amongst us

20:02.702 --> 20:05.872
eager to do us harm
in the name of their
pirate king.

20:08.775 --> 20:11.444
And I believe there is more
you could be doing

20:11.544 --> 20:14.547
to aid us in ferreting out
those radicals.

20:17.884 --> 20:20.987
If you choose to.

20:25.692 --> 20:28.761
I am very sorry
for the loss of your man,

20:28.861 --> 20:31.163
and I will be vigilant,
as I always am,

20:31.264 --> 20:33.099
about any information
that might allow us

20:33.300 --> 20:35.402
to make Nassau safe.

20:35.502 --> 20:38.104
But promises were made

20:38.305 --> 20:39.906
by the governor to me,

20:40.006 --> 20:42.141
by me to my informants.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.811
And if oaths
are no longer
kept here,

20:44.911 --> 20:48.147
if boundaries
are no longer
respected here,

20:48.247 --> 20:52.452
then there is no civilization
left here to defend,

20:52.552 --> 20:54.954
and I do not know
what we are fighting for.

20:59.826 --> 21:02.161
In a matter of hours,

21:02.329 --> 21:03.730
the governor and his wife
will set sail from here

21:03.830 --> 21:05.765
aboard separate vessels

21:05.865 --> 21:08.735
to seek aid in our efforts.

21:08.835 --> 21:13.740
He to Port Royal,
she to Philadelphia.

21:13.840 --> 21:18.044
I alone am to be left
in charge of Nassau's
security.

21:19.612 --> 21:22.248
And I gave
our lord governor
my solemn oath

21:22.349 --> 21:25.352
that I would
see it protected

21:25.418 --> 21:28.688
against any
and all enemies.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.392
I look forward
very much

21:32.492 --> 21:34.827
to be working with you
to that end.

21:44.404 --> 21:45.905
Philadelphia?

21:46.005 --> 21:49.376
What is in Philadelphia
worth leaving things
here in this state?

21:49.442 --> 21:50.977
My grandfather
spent his winters there

21:51.077 --> 21:52.979
negotiating
with his suppliers
for the spring.

21:53.079 --> 21:54.914
I'll find him there
and secure his assistance.

21:55.014 --> 21:56.749
I must strongly
advise against it,

21:56.849 --> 21:59.619
against you and the governor
being gone in this moment.

21:59.719 --> 22:01.888
We are so very close
to winning this war

22:01.988 --> 22:04.691
and finally bringing Nassau
out of the dark.

22:04.791 --> 22:07.460
But I fear we cannot complete
the victory on our own.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.929
We're going to need help,
and this is the only way
I know how to get it.

22:10.029 --> 22:12.932
You and I both know
that there are men on
both sides of this war

22:13.032 --> 22:15.502
whose identities are
so enmeshed in this conflict

22:15.602 --> 22:18.971
that they are more afraid
of ending it than they are
of losing it.

22:19.071 --> 22:21.508
And I believe you are about
to elevate one of those men

22:21.608 --> 22:24.176
into a position
of significant power.

22:24.411 --> 22:25.945
That may very well be,

22:26.045 --> 22:28.415
but Captain Berringer
is loyal.

22:28.481 --> 22:30.683
Captain Berringer
is strong.

22:30.783 --> 22:32.552
And at this moment,
Captain Berringer

22:32.652 --> 22:35.254
is a man before whom
Nassau lives in terror.

22:35.422 --> 22:38.157
Right now,
that might be
what she needs.

22:38.257 --> 22:41.293
The governor
will return soon

22:41.494 --> 22:42.562
and I soon thereafter.

22:42.662 --> 22:45.632
We just need things
to hold until then.

22:45.732 --> 22:48.067
And this seems like
our best chance at it.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.756
"More lies."

23:12.459 --> 23:15.962
Who else's lies am I to be
held responsible for?

23:24.170 --> 23:26.639
I heard a story once...

23:28.207 --> 23:30.843
told to me
by Captain Flint,

23:30.943 --> 23:34.547
who knows Nassau's history
as well as any other.

23:36.182 --> 23:39.986
A story about a man
consigned to the wrecks.

23:40.086 --> 23:43.956
A man who was
quite specifically
disfigured.

23:45.492 --> 23:47.827
A man who sailed
with Edward Teach

23:47.927 --> 23:49.529
in his early days.

23:49.629 --> 23:52.599
One of his
most trusted men...

23:54.033 --> 23:57.570
and one of the deadliest men
that Nassau ever knew.

23:59.972 --> 24:03.943
I heard that on the day
Governor Thompson fled,

24:04.043 --> 24:07.514
it was actually this man
who wielded the knife

24:07.580 --> 24:09.749
that killed
his wife and son.

24:09.849 --> 24:13.520
So, all Teach and Jennings
and the giants

24:13.620 --> 24:16.723
were hailed as the fathers
of the pirate republic.

24:18.224 --> 24:21.160
It was actually another
who cut the cord.

24:25.698 --> 24:28.200
I heard his name was...

24:30.102 --> 24:32.138
Israel Hands.

24:41.614 --> 24:43.883
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

24:46.285 --> 24:49.055
Though, given the rest
of the story,

24:49.155 --> 24:52.759
it is of some curiosity to me
that you're still here.

24:52.859 --> 24:55.728
See, I heard
that when Captain Teach

24:55.828 --> 24:59.031
began to see Charles Vane
as his heir apparent,

24:59.131 --> 25:02.134
Israel Hands became jealous
of Teach's affection

25:02.234 --> 25:04.571
and that it led
to a falling out
with the captain

25:04.604 --> 25:07.907
that was most humiliating.

25:09.676 --> 25:12.745
A degrading beating
before all the crews
on the beach.

25:12.845 --> 25:14.981
A pistol shot
just missing his eye,

25:15.081 --> 25:17.149
rendering him
a misshapen wretch.

25:19.318 --> 25:22.655
You talk too much.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.966
So, you can understand
my confusion,

25:34.066 --> 25:35.868
given that
Nassau's first king

25:35.968 --> 25:39.105
embarrassed you
so thoroughly and
so publicly,

25:39.205 --> 25:42.041
forbade any other crew
from having you.

25:42.141 --> 25:44.043
Why on earth
would you have stayed?

25:45.712 --> 25:48.314
I sincerely hope
it isn't because
you're still holding out

25:48.414 --> 25:50.617
for some sort of apology
from Teach.

26:03.262 --> 26:04.797
Fuck Teach.

26:05.965 --> 26:08.334
Yeah, fuck Teach.

26:08.434 --> 26:12.104
Huh?
We are brothers that
sail beneath the black.

26:12.204 --> 26:15.007
How can a man like that
be the best of us?

26:18.177 --> 26:21.981
Well, they followed Teach,
and where did it lead?

26:22.081 --> 26:25.985
An English governor
raising his flag over Nassau.

26:28.187 --> 26:31.257
Fuck Teach.

26:31.357 --> 26:33.793
He was almost
the end of us.

26:35.027 --> 26:37.563
But now I'm here

26:37.664 --> 26:40.166
and things are about
to begin again.

26:42.134 --> 26:44.671
You?

26:44.704 --> 26:48.240
Who are you that I ought
to pay you any mind?

26:48.340 --> 26:50.843
I'm no one.

26:52.378 --> 26:54.747
From nowhere.

26:54.847 --> 26:56.749
Belonging to nothing.

26:58.951 --> 27:01.253
I'm a wretch like you.

27:02.354 --> 27:05.091
And yet

27:05.191 --> 27:08.695
mountains of gold
have changed hands
because I chose it.

27:10.396 --> 27:13.432
Thousands of men in Nassau
are living in fear
of my return

27:13.700 --> 27:15.234
because I decreed it.

27:15.334 --> 27:19.171
Hundreds of dead redcoats
in a forest not far from here

27:19.271 --> 27:21.708
because I made it so.

27:23.409 --> 27:26.779
I'm the reason grown men
lie awake at night.

27:29.248 --> 27:31.984
I am a new beginning
for Nassau.

27:36.255 --> 27:39.826
And you'd trade
all of that for what?

27:41.227 --> 27:43.796
500 pieces?

27:49.769 --> 27:52.071
You think
you're worth more?

27:52.171 --> 27:54.841
To the right people.

27:56.943 --> 27:59.611
Who?

27:59.746 --> 28:02.181
Who would pay
so much for you?

28:31.343 --> 28:32.979
Enough.

28:36.983 --> 28:39.485
Is she asleep yet?

28:39.786 --> 28:41.821
Audrey?

28:43.055 --> 28:44.323
Are you asleep yet?

28:44.423 --> 28:46.592
Yes.

28:50.797 --> 28:51.798
Your daughter.

28:56.102 --> 28:58.838
Ruth, fix some more
hot water, would you?

29:02.875 --> 29:04.376
Ruth?

29:04.476 --> 29:07.146
What is it?

29:20.192 --> 29:23.095
We're under attack!

29:33.940 --> 29:35.307
Move! Move!

30:27.226 --> 30:29.128
The main
slave quarters.

30:29.228 --> 30:31.763
Take as many
extra weapons
as you can.

30:31.864 --> 30:33.399
Let's get them armed.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.401
It's only a matter of time
before militia arrive

30:35.501 --> 30:37.069
from other estates
that heard the alarm.

31:16.042 --> 31:17.143
Wait!

31:21.948 --> 31:23.849
If you shoot,

31:23.950 --> 31:25.284
I'll have to
do the same.

31:52.411 --> 31:53.579
Hello, Ruth.

32:11.998 --> 32:13.465
You knew my father.

32:16.435 --> 32:19.638
I had heard
that you might be coming

32:19.738 --> 32:21.773
to set us free.

32:22.041 --> 32:24.243
Yes.

32:25.577 --> 32:27.613
I'm glad
that you came.

32:30.216 --> 32:34.520
And now
I need you to go.

33:03.615 --> 33:05.684
They say your ship
is ready to depart.

33:07.119 --> 33:09.388
The launch awaits you
at the jetty.

33:14.093 --> 33:15.627
I should be going.

33:22.068 --> 33:24.303
How long do you think
to Port Royal?

33:24.403 --> 33:26.605
I'll make it.

33:26.705 --> 33:29.441
I promise you
I will make it.

33:29.541 --> 33:31.543
Don't you dare
let him catch you,
don't you dare.

33:31.643 --> 33:33.445
I won't.

33:36.682 --> 33:39.585
You wait until morning
to depart.

33:39.685 --> 33:42.288
I don't want him
lurking in the dark out there
awaiting another departure.

33:42.388 --> 33:43.689
I know.

33:46.725 --> 33:49.228
I hear Philadelphia
is lovely.

33:49.328 --> 33:51.263
Try not
to dawdle there.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.668
I will see you
back here again.

33:56.768 --> 33:58.204
Soon.

33:59.405 --> 34:00.739
Soon.

35:10.276 --> 35:12.611
He wants to know
when you're leaving.

35:15.681 --> 35:18.550
You have no intention
of leaving, do you?

35:21.987 --> 35:24.690
What exactly
do you suggest
I tell him?

35:24.790 --> 35:26.592
Whatever the fuck
you wanna tell him.

35:26.692 --> 35:29.027
Anne.

35:29.195 --> 35:30.896
At a certain point,
there is a good chance

35:30.996 --> 35:34.300
he'll just decide to kill you
than take your no for an answer.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.001
He can try.

35:36.202 --> 35:37.803
"He can try."

35:37.903 --> 35:40.539
I'll pass that one along.

35:42.608 --> 35:45.811
I go looking
for Eleanor Guthrie,

35:45.911 --> 35:48.414
you know I'm gonna
find her, too.

35:52.284 --> 35:54.386
Max.

35:54.486 --> 35:58.557
Said if I turned
over the cache,
you'd be safe.

36:00.892 --> 36:02.861
And it ain't
just the lie.

36:07.333 --> 36:09.768
She tried to take you
away from me.

36:15.441 --> 36:17.443
When I left
that island...

36:19.345 --> 36:22.381
all I could think about
was having a chance
to make her pay...

36:23.549 --> 36:25.284
for what she done.

36:28.254 --> 36:29.955
Now that we're here...

36:33.259 --> 36:35.294
it would be so easy.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.899
And I don't
wanna do it.

36:45.271 --> 36:47.473
Don't wanna
live with it after.

36:50.276 --> 36:52.811
The sight of her hurt
in that way.

36:55.781 --> 36:57.283
Just don't want it.

37:04.423 --> 37:06.958
That fucking island.

37:09.295 --> 37:11.663
Makes you do shit
you don't wanna do.

37:15.967 --> 37:18.637
How is it we haven't
figured that out by now?

37:22.007 --> 37:24.576
What the hell are we
doing back here, Jack?

37:31.583 --> 37:34.185
It's the governor's banner!

37:34.320 --> 37:36.388
Glass, please.
Quickly.

38:07.786 --> 38:10.188
Well,
the good news is...

38:10.356 --> 38:12.157
Ben's squad
just found a storehouse
filled to the ceiling

38:12.358 --> 38:14.360
of salt pork, corn.

38:14.393 --> 38:17.262
They must have been
readying a shipment
back into Nassau.

38:17.363 --> 38:19.998
So, between that
and the ordinance
we just scavenged,

38:20.098 --> 38:22.968
we may be better supplied
than the British in Nassau
at this moment.

38:24.703 --> 38:26.472
That said,

38:26.572 --> 38:29.741
the strangest thing
just happened out by
the slave quarters.

38:29.841 --> 38:32.411
The doors were locked

38:32.511 --> 38:35.080
from the inside.

38:37.048 --> 38:38.717
How did you know that?

38:44.590 --> 38:46.425
What?

38:47.926 --> 38:49.528
What did she tell you?

38:51.397 --> 38:54.600
When I acquired those weapons
we used to fight the British,

38:54.700 --> 38:58.437
it apparently aroused suspicion
amongst the estate owners,

38:58.537 --> 39:01.573
concerned that the alliance
between your people and mine

39:01.673 --> 39:05.811
might prove dangerous
to maintaining control
over their holdings,

39:05.911 --> 39:07.779
so they took
precautions

39:07.879 --> 39:11.617
against any move
that might incite revolt.

39:13.151 --> 39:15.286
Any man
who had a woman,

39:15.421 --> 39:19.991
any woman
who had a child
was separated.

39:20.091 --> 39:23.995
With families distributed
amongst the other plantations
on the island,

39:24.095 --> 39:27.666
if any one community
revolted

39:27.766 --> 39:30.936
or by inaction
allowed an estate
to be toppled,

39:31.036 --> 39:33.772
their husbands
and wives

39:33.872 --> 39:36.442
and children who are held
on the other plantations

39:36.508 --> 39:39.911
would be punished
most severely.

39:41.447 --> 39:43.882
If we complete
this conquest,

39:43.982 --> 39:45.684
if we force a situation

39:45.784 --> 39:48.687
which might see
these people's husbands
and wives and children

39:48.787 --> 39:50.689
brutalized this way,

39:50.789 --> 39:54.526
many of them would
die by their own hand
before they let that happen.

39:54.626 --> 39:57.463
We'll move quickly,
take the other plantations
as well.

39:57.563 --> 39:59.531
To seven
different estates?

40:01.500 --> 40:02.934
Wait a minute.

40:03.034 --> 40:06.004
We have no choice.
You want to withdraw?

40:06.104 --> 40:08.440
If we don't,
knowing full well
the cost,

40:08.540 --> 40:10.408
it will be the end
of whatever trust exists

40:10.509 --> 40:12.410
between us and the slaves
on the island,

40:12.511 --> 40:14.179
or anywhere,
for that matter.

40:14.279 --> 40:16.515
The end of any alliance
that might be between us.

40:16.615 --> 40:18.183
How is leaving them here
any better?

40:18.283 --> 40:20.085
The only way
to free them safely

40:20.185 --> 40:21.687
is if it is
all at once.

40:21.787 --> 40:24.122
Simultaneous revolts
across the island

40:24.222 --> 40:26.057
initiated by
one very loud

40:26.157 --> 40:28.660
and very clear signal
that will be heard by all.

40:28.760 --> 40:31.329
If we take
Nassau first...
Take it first?

40:31.429 --> 40:32.964
...it would demonstrate
to the slave communities

40:33.064 --> 40:35.366
the viability
of our enterprise.

40:35.467 --> 40:38.236
Show them that beyond revolt
lies a safe harbor

40:38.336 --> 40:40.171
with allies strong enough
to protect them.

40:40.271 --> 40:43.975
It is the only way
to ensure that the greatest
number of them survive.

40:45.443 --> 40:47.913
I lost six men tonight.

40:49.481 --> 40:51.483
The men I have left
know this estate

40:51.583 --> 40:53.384
means supplies
and full stomachs.

40:53.485 --> 40:55.487
They know they are
stronger with it.

40:55.587 --> 40:59.491
And, thus, fewer of them
will die in the weeks ahead
than would without it.

40:59.591 --> 41:03.228
And you want to walk away.
We didn't come here
to take an estate.

41:03.328 --> 41:05.731
We came here
to make a statement,

41:05.831 --> 41:08.667
not just to expel England,
but to defeat them.

41:08.767 --> 41:11.402
And to do it together.
That has always been the goal.

41:11.537 --> 41:15.040
And right now, that requires
a painful but necessary
tactical retreat.

41:17.042 --> 41:18.977
I'm asking you...

41:20.045 --> 41:21.913
please...

41:23.949 --> 41:25.751
don't do this.

41:31.790 --> 41:33.625
Militia's approaching.

41:33.725 --> 41:36.595
The neighboring estates
must've heard the guns
and rallied.

41:39.164 --> 41:41.266
This was never
gonna be easy.

41:42.668 --> 41:43.902
It just is what it is.

41:55.714 --> 41:57.816
There's been a change
in circumstances.

41:57.916 --> 42:00.586
We need to be gone
before that militia arrives.

42:00.652 --> 42:02.420
Gather all the weapons
you can.

42:02.588 --> 42:05.190
We're gonna be moving
back towards--
We're not going anywhere.

42:07.593 --> 42:09.795
Henry, Davis,
restrain the captain.

42:11.062 --> 42:13.599
What are you doing?

42:13.699 --> 42:17.903
I'm through
following you down a path
only you seem able to see.

42:18.003 --> 42:21.907
Towards a victory
only you seem able to define.

42:22.007 --> 42:23.441
We will hold
our position here

42:23.609 --> 42:25.010
until we can find
our way into Nassau

42:25.110 --> 42:26.912
and free
the rest of the men.

42:27.012 --> 42:28.980
And we will do it
without you.

42:29.080 --> 42:31.182
Do it.

42:31.282 --> 42:33.919
The rest of you
form a firing line
to repel that militia.

42:49.234 --> 42:52.203
Are you sure you want
to keep following him
down that path?

42:59.144 --> 43:00.746
Stand your men down

43:00.846 --> 43:04.082
and follow me
away from here,

43:04.182 --> 43:06.885
for any man who
offers resistance
to that militia

43:06.985 --> 43:09.688
will be held
responsible for--
Fire!

43:51.096 --> 43:52.864
Plantation men!

43:54.432 --> 43:57.202
It's over now!
We're under attack!

43:59.137 --> 44:01.940
- Fall back! Fall back!
- Fall back!

44:03.308 --> 44:05.711
Fall back to the corn field!

44:27.265 --> 44:29.134
It's been confirmed.

44:29.234 --> 44:30.836
The governor was spotted
boarding the brig.

44:30.936 --> 44:32.904
They're hauling back
their anchor as we speak.

44:42.313 --> 44:44.415
He'll be gone
within the hour,

44:44.515 --> 44:48.153
off in search of aid,
no doubt, to secure his
possession of Nassau,

44:48.253 --> 44:49.788
win the war
for England.

44:49.888 --> 44:52.824
And with him will depart
a number of soldiers,

44:52.924 --> 44:54.225
diminishing
the number of bodies

44:54.325 --> 44:56.361
between us
and Eleanor Guthrie.

44:56.461 --> 45:00.966
That many fewer obstacles
between us and justice
for Charles' murder.

45:01.066 --> 45:04.502
If you still wish Anne to
lead the vanguard to do it,
tell me now.

45:04.770 --> 45:06.171
I'll have it done.

45:11.576 --> 45:13.779
Would you like to know
what I think?

45:16.081 --> 45:18.349
I think Anne is right.

45:19.818 --> 45:22.053
She said something
to me earlier.

45:22.153 --> 45:26.858
She said only a fool
would give his life to earn
the admiration of a corpse.

45:33.464 --> 45:35.266
I wanted to strangle her.

45:35.366 --> 45:39.004
But part of me could not help
but note in that moment

45:39.104 --> 45:42.307
she sounded an awful lot
like someone else I once knew,

45:42.407 --> 45:45.476
someone you and I both
once knew

45:45.576 --> 45:49.347
who shared
Anne's mistrust

45:49.447 --> 45:51.316
of sentimentality.

46:03.628 --> 46:05.831
And just after
he joined my crew...

46:07.632 --> 46:12.337
I spent two weeks careening
on this shit island
with no name.

46:14.072 --> 46:17.008
I knew right away
he was different
than the others.

46:18.476 --> 46:21.279
He was so like me
when I was a younger man.

46:22.380 --> 46:24.850
And that he and I

46:24.883 --> 46:27.886
somehow were fated
to matter to one another.

46:31.089 --> 46:34.359
I was consumed with
the question of whether
our similarities

46:34.459 --> 46:36.094
would be a blessing
or a curse.

46:40.098 --> 46:44.002
So, whilst the others
were careening,

46:44.102 --> 46:47.072
a number of us
were inland

46:47.172 --> 46:49.374
by a spring.

46:51.542 --> 46:54.880
The sun climbs up
over the top of the trees

46:54.913 --> 46:59.017
in just a way that
it shines off the pool...

47:00.085 --> 47:02.553
lighting up
all around us.

47:05.456 --> 47:07.993
In that moment,

47:08.093 --> 47:10.495
a bird lands
on the water--

47:10.595 --> 47:14.465
massive,
snow-white beast,

47:14.565 --> 47:16.767
big as a boar.

47:16.902 --> 47:20.038
To this day, I've never
seen anything like it.

47:22.340 --> 47:24.209
Between the sun
and the size of it,

47:24.309 --> 47:27.112
it just felt...

47:29.915 --> 47:31.416
meaningful.

47:33.952 --> 47:37.288
The answer to a question
I did not yet know
how to ask.

47:39.057 --> 47:41.459
I told him

47:41.559 --> 47:44.129
that there were
men in the east

47:44.229 --> 47:48.934
who would have
seen in that bird
the darkest of all omens,

47:49.000 --> 47:51.636
bringer of death.

47:51.937 --> 47:53.939
But then,

47:54.005 --> 47:59.777
there are other men
near Clifton-- my--
my mother's home--

47:59.945 --> 48:04.149
who would've called it
a sign of great fortune,

48:04.249 --> 48:05.984
an indication
from the heavens

48:06.084 --> 48:09.454
that someone up there
favored our endeavor
together.

48:17.128 --> 48:21.566
And I asked him
what he thought it meant.

48:29.640 --> 48:31.542
"Dinner."

48:39.017 --> 48:41.686
I don't know what made me
think of that story.

48:48.126 --> 48:52.197
There are moments
in the dead of night
when I can't sleep

48:52.297 --> 48:56.401
and I wonder if I will ever
be able to truly rest again

48:56.501 --> 49:00.238
until I know that
Eleanor Guthrie has paid
for what she took from me.

49:01.606 --> 49:03.041
And then there are
other moments

49:03.141 --> 49:07.012
when I wonder if it would
actually please him
to see her dead,

49:07.112 --> 49:10.348
to know the scales
had been evened.

49:10.448 --> 49:13.218
Or if despite
all they had been through,

49:13.318 --> 49:16.221
despite the anger
and the blood and the betrayal

49:16.321 --> 49:19.024
and all he'd done to her
and she to him,

49:19.090 --> 49:22.060
despite what I or you
or what anybody else
might think of it,

49:22.160 --> 49:23.861
if wherever he was,

49:24.029 --> 49:26.731
he still didn't
just a little bit love her.

49:29.034 --> 49:30.868
I wonder
if he were here now,

49:31.036 --> 49:35.206
watching us battle with
the choice to kill her
in his name

49:35.306 --> 49:37.308
or defeat the governor

49:37.408 --> 49:40.311
and perhaps
therein win the war
we all together started,

49:40.411 --> 49:44.915
if he might
call us fools.

49:45.050 --> 49:48.219
And then I wonder
if maybe we don't
have to work that hard

49:48.319 --> 49:50.055
to imagine
what he'd say.

49:52.123 --> 49:55.060
Maybe we've
already heard it,

49:55.126 --> 49:59.097
and the only choice
is whether we choose
to listen.

50:09.240 --> 50:11.409
Cannon fire
from the port!

50:22.653 --> 50:24.255
He's underway,
Captain.

50:24.355 --> 50:26.291
Using the fort guns
for cover.

50:26.391 --> 50:28.459
Do we pursue?

50:37.302 --> 50:39.137
Slip the cables.

50:40.571 --> 50:42.640
Set a course
to overtake her.

50:42.740 --> 50:44.209
Slip the cable!

50:44.309 --> 50:46.043
Set course to pursue!

51:26.451 --> 51:27.752
Ma'am?

52:56.341 --> 52:59.577
Long John Silver.

52:59.677 --> 53:02.813
So big a name
for so small a man.

53:04.482 --> 53:06.717
What is it
you have to say to me?

53:08.253 --> 53:09.820
You owe me.

53:10.988 --> 53:12.557
Certainly your fortune.

53:12.657 --> 53:15.092
Probably your life.

53:15.260 --> 53:19.129
You might wanna consider that
and then choose a new tone,

53:19.264 --> 53:22.267
especially given that
in the very near future

53:22.300 --> 53:26.271
your life might end up
in my hands yet again.

53:26.337 --> 53:27.738
Is that so?

53:30.841 --> 53:32.877
Is Teach still free?

53:35.346 --> 53:36.747
Is Rackham?

53:38.349 --> 53:39.984
Is Flint?

53:45.923 --> 53:49.294
This war
may feel over,

53:49.360 --> 53:52.630
but as long
as we're all free,
it's far from it.

53:52.730 --> 53:56.133
And if somehow
we prevail in Nassau,

53:56.301 --> 53:58.002
what happens
to former friends

53:58.102 --> 54:01.506
who've since
aligned themselves
so warmly with the governor?

54:03.508 --> 54:06.377
I've come
to offer you a chance

54:06.477 --> 54:08.579
to earn back
our friendship.

54:08.679 --> 54:11.949
Or, more specifically,
to buy it back.

54:12.049 --> 54:15.653
An amount of money that
proves your desire to come--
No.

54:17.922 --> 54:19.957
No?

54:20.057 --> 54:23.227
I am tired of this.

54:23.328 --> 54:26.030
This thing
that perpetuates itself

54:26.130 --> 54:29.900
with anger and bluster
and blood.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.803
I do not want
to be your friend.

54:32.903 --> 54:36.341
What I want is
for all of this to end.

54:36.441 --> 54:40.044
For it to end,
you must end.

54:47.117 --> 54:48.719
I imagine I have
some obligation

54:48.819 --> 54:50.721
to surrender you
to Captain Berringer,

54:50.821 --> 54:54.024
but the spectacle
he would make of your
trial and execution

54:54.124 --> 54:58.262
would only fan the flames
of what is burning
in Nassau now.

54:58.363 --> 55:01.732
I am tempted to put the sword
to you and your man both,

55:01.832 --> 55:03.801
and bury this story
for good,

55:03.901 --> 55:05.536
but what am I

55:05.636 --> 55:09.206
if I spend my days pleading
for a return to civility

55:09.374 --> 55:12.910
and then do dark things
under the cover of night?

55:13.010 --> 55:14.912
So, you will remain
in my custody

55:15.012 --> 55:18.449
until I can find
a place far from here
to deposit you.

55:18.549 --> 55:20.485
You will be gone,

55:20.585 --> 55:22.553
but you will live.

55:22.653 --> 55:26.624
And for that,
I will consider
whatever debts I may owe you

55:26.724 --> 55:29.494
to be paid in full.
