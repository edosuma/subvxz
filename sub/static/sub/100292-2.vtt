00:21.720 --> 00:23.240
I...

00:25.720 --> 00:28.680
can't bear a bad book. Can you?

00:29.920 --> 00:33.840
It's a commitment. It's a contract
between an author and a reader,

00:33.920 --> 00:36.600
and I have to be engaged at once.

00:38.040 --> 00:41.000
After all, one only has so much time.

00:41.480 --> 00:44.400
Uh, it's something
you have in abundance, surely.

00:44.480 --> 00:46.320
Well, more than most, perhaps,

00:46.400 --> 00:50.160
but, really, it's the quality
of the time spent, isn't it?

00:50.560 --> 00:51.920
Why are we talking about stories?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.600
Because I want to tell you one.

00:55.080 --> 00:56.040
Please.

00:58.520 --> 01:01.040
As you can see,
there's a game in progress.

01:01.120 --> 01:03.760
- A knight is menacing a queen.
- Mm-hmm.

01:03.840 --> 01:05.960
-Who's knight? Who's queen?
-Who's black? Who's white?

01:06.040 --> 01:07.160
You choose.

01:14.160 --> 01:15.240
Ah...

01:15.320 --> 01:17.680
-The losing side.
-We shall see.

01:20.320 --> 01:23.000
So, after you left the convent, what then?

01:23.080 --> 01:27.840
I had already booked a passage to England
on board the Demeter.

01:28.320 --> 01:29.960
It must have been an interesting voyage.

01:30.040 --> 01:32.480
Ah, you have no idea.

01:32.560 --> 01:33.880
Well, then tell me.

01:35.560 --> 01:38.200
It's a long and complex story.

01:38.840 --> 01:42.360
At sea, one meets
an interesting range of characters,

01:42.840 --> 01:47.240
and I would advise you not to get
too attached to any of them.

02:34.280 --> 02:36.000
Yes, do it!

02:53.160 --> 02:54.040
Uh...

02:57.120 --> 02:59.840
Have you seen my hand, Captain?

03:00.800 --> 03:01.720
What?

03:05.400 --> 03:06.560
Captain?

03:07.120 --> 03:09.600
-Have you seen my hand?

03:10.320 --> 03:13.920
Have you seen my hand?

03:30.920 --> 03:32.680
Are you sure this is the right one?

03:33.920 --> 03:35.480
It's the grave you pointed out.

03:36.520 --> 03:40.000
The one the children... complained about?

03:40.080 --> 03:42.000
The one with the weeping.

03:46.280 --> 03:47.400
Well, open it.

04:00.080 --> 04:02.520
This unfortunate was buried alive.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.280
Observe the scratches.

04:04.840 --> 04:06.280
It is as I feared.

04:08.560 --> 04:09.440
Do you see?

04:11.000 --> 04:11.960
See what?

04:13.160 --> 04:15.120
This coffin is 70 years old,

04:15.200 --> 04:17.840
and yet some of the scratches
are quite fresh.

04:51.280 --> 04:55.880
My Piotr. My beautiful boy.

04:56.480 --> 04:57.480
Piotr!

04:57.960 --> 05:00.160
I am so sorry, my child.

05:00.640 --> 05:02.680
He had such plans.

05:03.560 --> 05:06.560
He had been offered a place
on a sailing ship.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.680
-He was going to see the world.

05:09.840 --> 05:13.000
But he never even left
this miserable town.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.400
Yes,
Piotr would have made a very fine sailor.

05:26.760 --> 05:30.120
If you love him, my child,
you know what you must do.

05:30.960 --> 05:31.960
Do it.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.040
- I can't!
-Do it!

05:34.520 --> 05:36.360
-I can't!
-Do it!

06:02.400 --> 06:04.360
Sign your name here, Piotr.

06:11.760 --> 06:13.280
-Ah!

06:17.080 --> 06:20.360
I'll try to get you back
in one piece this time.

06:21.280 --> 06:22.360
How many times?

06:23.440 --> 06:26.040
No one blamed you for what happened.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.680
And what do I need two hands for?

06:27.760 --> 06:30.000
This is better for stirring soup.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.520
So thanks!

06:33.000 --> 06:34.920
Lord and Lady Ruthven.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Ah.

06:36.760 --> 06:37.640
Great pleasure.

06:37.720 --> 06:40.160
Welcome aboard the Demeter,
My Lord, My Lady.

06:40.240 --> 06:43.400
Thank you. We just got married.
Isn't it wonderful?

06:43.480 --> 06:46.080
Oh, wonderful.
My congratulations to you both.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.520
Make it a long voyage, eh, Captain?

06:53.520 --> 06:54.720
Oh, it will be.

07:13.240 --> 07:15.840
Stop your dreaming, son.

07:15.920 --> 07:18.920
She's not for the likes of you.
Here, drink.

07:22.480 --> 07:23.560
Move on.

07:29.080 --> 07:31.040
Uh... Piotr.

07:32.240 --> 07:33.080
Piotr, yes?

07:33.640 --> 07:35.840
Yes. Piotr, that's me.

07:37.280 --> 07:38.400
Here, drink.

07:43.560 --> 07:44.440
Move.

07:49.280 --> 07:51.680
Ah, look at this one.

07:53.960 --> 07:56.000
Are you as green as your face?

07:57.480 --> 08:01.800
You're probably thinking all this looks
very strange...

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
and frightening.

08:05.000 --> 08:05.960
Yes, sir.

08:07.280 --> 08:08.280
I agree.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.720
How many passengers?

08:38.240 --> 08:39.640
- Seven.
- Cargo?

08:40.200 --> 08:44.120
Saltpeter, children's dolls, sulfur,
soil, charcoal.

08:44.200 --> 08:45.120
Soil?

08:45.680 --> 08:48.240
Or mold. Boxes and boxes of it.

08:49.280 --> 08:51.440
Why would anyone send boxes of mold?

08:51.520 --> 08:53.280
Who knows? Who cares?

08:53.840 --> 08:55.760
I'm sure it'll taste better
than your food.

08:55.840 --> 08:57.280
Me too.

08:57.880 --> 08:58.960
Bad luck...

08:59.560 --> 09:01.440
having women on board.

09:01.520 --> 09:04.640
You mark my word,
no good will come of it.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.160
All aboard?

09:14.240 --> 09:16.560
All but one... sir.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.160
-Uh, a Count--
-Count Dracula.

09:22.320 --> 09:23.480
<i>I'm sorry, what?</i>

09:23.560 --> 09:24.600
Is there a problem?

09:24.920 --> 09:27.440
You were traveling openly
with the passengers?

09:27.520 --> 09:29.680
It's four weeks to England.

09:29.760 --> 09:32.600
What did you think I was going to do,
lie around in a box?

09:38.800 --> 09:40.240
No, don't disturb.

09:41.240 --> 09:44.760
It's... a sick passenger.

09:45.720 --> 09:48.160
-Sick?
-They came on board last night apparently.

09:48.240 --> 09:49.520
All had disease.

09:50.600 --> 09:55.160
Only the captain is allowed to...
see them.

09:55.240 --> 09:57.560
-Go off about your business.
-Yes, sir.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.080
Do you make a habit of listening
at doors?

10:10.160 --> 10:12.720
- Sorry, sir.
- No. No, no, no.

10:12.800 --> 10:14.240
I'm not making judgments.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.280
Your accent,

10:17.360 --> 10:19.200
traces of Bavarian, is it?

10:20.040 --> 10:22.120
Yes, sir.

10:22.200 --> 10:25.640
Bavaria. It's been a while.

10:26.640 --> 10:27.600
Forgive me.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.040
It's the sea air. Makes one, um...

10:33.080 --> 10:34.040
ravenous.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.080
Maybe paprika?

11:05.520 --> 11:06.920
New at sea, are you?

11:07.800 --> 11:08.880
You won't last.

11:09.280 --> 11:10.640
Your kind never do.

11:12.240 --> 11:15.320
-What's my kind?
-I don't know. Where are you from?

11:16.280 --> 11:20.400
-BistriÅ£a.
-Ah, Romanian, like the second mate.

11:22.520 --> 11:24.080
What's wrong with the second mate?

11:24.520 --> 11:25.360
Romanian.

11:27.600 --> 11:28.960
I always wanted to go to sea.

11:29.040 --> 11:29.920
Boring.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.920
I thought I'd never get out of
that stupid little town.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.160
-Still boring.
-But nothing ever happened...

11:36.000 --> 11:36.960
until now,

11:38.440 --> 11:39.720
and here I am.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.720
Yes, here you are, boring me...

11:43.960 --> 11:45.080
and from Romania.

11:46.720 --> 11:48.280
-Sorry.
-Here.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.040
Drink this, it will stop your mouth.

11:57.240 --> 11:58.480
The way you tell your story,

11:58.560 --> 12:00.360
-you know what it sounds like?
-Sir?

12:01.640 --> 12:02.680
A story.

12:05.440 --> 12:06.320
You like it?

12:08.040 --> 12:08.960
Needs paprika.

12:10.760 --> 12:13.040
It needs paprika!

12:15.840 --> 12:17.000
Ring the bell, boy.

12:17.840 --> 12:18.760
Dinnertime.

12:59.960 --> 13:03.480
-Hey, you, what is this marc?
-Sir?

13:03.560 --> 13:04.600
Take it back.

13:05.400 --> 13:06.520
It will not do.

13:07.160 --> 13:09.680
I'm sure we can find a better vintage
for your master.

13:09.760 --> 13:11.600
Not for him, for me.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.760
I want only the finest.

13:14.840 --> 13:16.240
Then you're on the wrong ship.

13:19.440 --> 13:20.960
I am Dr. Sharma.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.240
Good for you.

13:24.760 --> 13:28.440
Forgive me,
are you in this gentleman's employ?

13:28.880 --> 13:29.920
He is my man.

13:30.960 --> 13:31.800
Hmm.

13:31.880 --> 13:32.920
He pays my wages.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.520
Not the same thing.

13:35.600 --> 13:37.360
Then you have settled a dispute.

13:44.560 --> 13:45.920
Oh, uh, deaf and dumb.

13:46.720 --> 13:49.280
-Poor child.
-She has eyes, though.

13:50.280 --> 13:51.960
Oh, yes.

13:53.560 --> 13:54.400
Adisa.

13:58.360 --> 14:01.160
Please don't cause a scene.

14:01.640 --> 14:05.280
This marriage is a necessary evil.
You know that.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.040
Just don't call me your man.

14:10.640 --> 14:11.560
It hurts.

14:15.040 --> 14:17.800
I think it's probably safe
to have the fish.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.400
-I beg your pardon?
-We're surrounded by water.

14:23.080 --> 14:24.560
One must hope the fish is fresh.

14:25.800 --> 14:28.520
I'm afraid I am very careful
with what I eat.

14:29.440 --> 14:30.320
Me too.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.080
<i>I'm sorry, I don't understand.</i>

14:32.560 --> 14:33.800
<i>What's unclear to you?</i>

14:33.880 --> 14:36.520
You went to the dining room.
You don't eat food.

14:36.600 --> 14:39.560
I enjoy company, and I like people.

14:39.640 --> 14:40.960
Then why do you kill them?

14:41.040 --> 14:42.440
Why do you pick flowers?

14:44.080 --> 14:45.200
May I join you?

14:45.960 --> 14:48.320
But we haven't been introduced.

14:49.520 --> 14:52.400
And yet, you do seem a little familiar.

14:52.480 --> 14:56.520
Oh, my dear lady,
I promise to be as familiar as you like.

14:59.600 --> 15:03.480
I am the Grand Duchess Valeria
of Augsburg.

15:04.720 --> 15:06.280
And I'm Count Dracula...

15:08.320 --> 15:09.520
of Wallachia.

15:11.560 --> 15:13.120
You're very wicked.

15:14.560 --> 15:15.760
It has been said.

15:15.840 --> 15:18.400
May I ask why you are traveling
to England?

15:18.480 --> 15:20.840
-I have been invited.
-Uh-huh.

15:20.920 --> 15:24.840
I am connected by birth
to the ruling house of Bavaria,

15:25.600 --> 15:27.760
but, alas, I am not in favor.

15:28.520 --> 15:32.520
A gentleman in England
wishes to write the story of my life.

15:32.600 --> 15:33.440
I see.

15:33.520 --> 15:36.360
And Mr. Balaur pays.

15:36.760 --> 15:39.520
I know it's vulgar,
but I have seen my way of life

15:39.600 --> 15:43.280
and my fortune wither
like a frost-ravaged vine.

15:43.720 --> 15:46.480
Here you find me,

15:46.560 --> 15:53.400
rattling around in this leaky coffin
like a dried old pea.

15:56.720 --> 15:57.680
Forgive me.

15:58.840 --> 16:01.520
My German is very rusty.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.120
Would you excuse me for a moment?

16:07.200 --> 16:08.240
Oh.

16:08.600 --> 16:11.000
Good evening... sir.

16:11.880 --> 16:13.440
Keep looking at the moon.

16:18.320 --> 16:20.320
I've no wish to disturb you.

16:22.840 --> 16:24.480
It spoils the flavor.

16:27.040 --> 16:28.400
Sir?

16:29.360 --> 16:31.400
Please... sir!

16:38.760 --> 16:40.000
I'm sorry.

16:40.080 --> 16:42.400
That took a little longer than I expected.

16:42.880 --> 16:45.760
It's a fine night.

16:45.840 --> 16:48.040
A beautiful moon.

16:48.120 --> 16:49.760
But your German...

16:50.800 --> 16:52.080
Your German is excellent.

16:52.160 --> 16:53.600
Oh,  you're too kind.

16:53.680 --> 16:58.240
I seem to have remembered
more than I thought.

16:59.160 --> 17:00.920
It's good to refresh oneself.

17:03.520 --> 17:06.800
You killed a crew member
just so you could show off in German.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.920
Might have been a little wasteful?

17:09.000 --> 17:12.920
His charming Bavarian accent
was the only interesting thing about him.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.480
You left no one at the wheel.

17:15.880 --> 17:17.560
Do you have no self-control?

17:23.400 --> 17:26.960
But you were telling me of your estate,
of the old days.

17:27.040 --> 17:29.000
Such parties.

17:30.720 --> 17:32.320
For my 18th birthday,

17:33.040 --> 17:35.520
I was given a great treat.

17:35.600 --> 17:38.160
You'll never guess what it was.
Go on, guess.

17:38.240 --> 17:39.080
I don't know.

17:39.160 --> 17:41.840
- Guess.
-Um... A jeweled tiara?

17:44.560 --> 17:47.840
Mother led me down the great staircase.

17:47.920 --> 17:51.680
Oh, I could feel my heart thumping
in my breast.

17:51.760 --> 17:53.880
-Guess again.
- A pony?

17:54.360 --> 17:55.720
No, no.

17:56.720 --> 17:58.560
I was led into the ballroom.

17:59.280 --> 18:03.200
Mama took my hands, and I reached out.

18:04.360 --> 18:07.520
My present was wrapped in tissue paper,

18:07.600 --> 18:10.760
pink tissue paper, wrapped very tightly.

18:11.800 --> 18:14.160
And so, I tore at it in my excitement.

18:14.840 --> 18:19.440
And then,
when I could no longer stand the suspense,

18:19.520 --> 18:21.560
I pulled off my blindfold...

18:24.520 --> 18:26.600
and I saw what it was.

18:28.000 --> 18:28.960
A pineapple.

18:33.040 --> 18:36.400
A pineapple in the depths
of that freezing winter.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.760
It must have seemed liked magic.

18:39.280 --> 18:43.320
Transported from the emperor's
own hothouse like a precious jewel.

18:44.280 --> 18:46.280
- <i>I knew it.</i>

18:46.840 --> 18:49.520
It's impossible, but I knew it.

18:50.320 --> 18:51.480
It's you.

18:51.560 --> 18:52.880
Of course it's me.

18:54.840 --> 18:57.680
Valeria, how we danced.

18:59.000 --> 18:59.840
Yes.

19:02.240 --> 19:05.200
That was the night my mother disappeared.

19:05.760 --> 19:06.600
Yes.

19:07.920 --> 19:09.360
Who are you?

19:11.160 --> 19:12.640
Shall we dance again?

20:20.920 --> 20:23.160
-You've searched everywhere?
-We have.

20:23.640 --> 20:24.800
Portmann's gone.

20:25.360 --> 20:27.880
Why can't we get clear of this fog?

20:28.720 --> 20:30.440
It's like it's following us.

20:31.200 --> 20:32.400
Sorry, sir...

20:34.040 --> 20:36.160
but we didn't search everywhere.

20:36.240 --> 20:37.880
-What do you mean?
-Well...

20:39.000 --> 20:42.240
We didn't look in cabin number nine, sir.
Your orders.

20:42.840 --> 20:45.520
Of course.
You did right not to disturb our invalid.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.720
No one's likely to be hiding in there,
are they?

20:47.800 --> 20:48.640
Sir!

20:50.240 --> 20:53.040
One of the passengers, the grand duchess.

20:53.120 --> 20:54.240
What about her?

20:54.840 --> 20:56.160
We can't find her either.

21:02.120 --> 21:03.680
The fog is interesting.

21:03.760 --> 21:04.640
In what way?

21:05.200 --> 21:07.640
Useful in blocking out the sunlight,
I would have thought.

21:07.720 --> 21:09.000
You know what they say,

21:10.680 --> 21:12.480
"Always take the weather with you."

21:20.520 --> 21:21.920
Looking for the duchess?

21:22.720 --> 21:24.920
Have you ever heard of Nelson, Piotr?

21:26.000 --> 21:26.920
Nelson, sir?

21:27.480 --> 21:29.840
Britisher, soul of Napoleon.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.320
One eye, one arm. No?

21:36.320 --> 21:39.440
The young, how soon they forget.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.880
Admiral Nelson was killed
at the Battle of Trafalgar.

21:43.960 --> 21:45.600
Died of his wounds, they say.

21:46.280 --> 21:48.480
And they wanted to get him back to England
with all speed.

21:48.560 --> 21:49.440
National hero.

21:49.520 --> 21:52.200
The British are very keen
on that sort of thing.

21:53.080 --> 21:54.720
But Spain is quite a way,

21:55.520 --> 21:57.920
and it was hot,
so what do you think they did?

22:00.720 --> 22:05.120
They put the old admiral
into a barrel of rum to preserve him.

22:05.560 --> 22:06.800
-No.
-True.

22:07.200 --> 22:09.680
Trouble is, they didn't tell the crew.

22:09.760 --> 22:11.800
So when they got home to England,

22:11.880 --> 22:14.240
they found out that those thirsty sailors

22:14.320 --> 22:16.320
had been helping themselves
to a drop or two

22:16.400 --> 22:18.040
all the way back to Portsmouth.

22:18.120 --> 22:19.880
-Oh.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.680
I'm sure it had quite a kick, that rum.

22:24.360 --> 22:25.480
Now, let's find out.

22:32.040 --> 22:33.400
No!

22:35.360 --> 22:37.080
-Oh.

22:38.480 --> 22:39.880
No corpses in here.

22:41.240 --> 22:42.640
Thank you, Count Dracula.

22:44.280 --> 22:45.480
I'm so new to this.

22:46.400 --> 22:49.160
-I don't think I'm much use to anyone.
-Piotr.

22:49.640 --> 22:52.040
I met a Piotr once.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.280
Briefly.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.320
<i>Is there much point</i>
<i>in menacing a cabin boy?</i>

23:06.400 --> 23:08.320
I'm a fool for youth and beauty.

23:12.960 --> 23:16.520
A proper inquiry will, of course,
be conducted once we reach England.

23:16.600 --> 23:18.840
I remain at your disposal at all times.

23:19.760 --> 23:20.640
Good afternoon.

23:21.640 --> 23:22.640
Thank you.

23:23.600 --> 23:25.680
Two people gone in one night.

23:26.440 --> 23:28.320
Was the sea particularly rough?

23:28.400 --> 23:31.040
I don't know. I am a heavy sleeper.

23:32.120 --> 23:35.000
And where's your wife, My Lord?

23:35.080 --> 23:36.560
Is she not joining us?

23:36.640 --> 23:39.040
Dorabella is a little...

23:40.400 --> 23:41.480
How shall I put it?

23:42.160 --> 23:44.560
She's quite exhausted, poor thing.

23:45.040 --> 23:45.920
Dorabella.

23:46.720 --> 23:49.520
What an enchanting name. Dorabella, hmm.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.440
It lingers on the tongue.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.160
Why would you spend your time up here

23:54.240 --> 23:55.920
when Dorabella lies below?

23:56.240 --> 23:58.160
One can have too much of a good thing.

23:58.240 --> 23:59.640
Ah...

23:59.920 --> 24:01.120
On the contrary,

24:01.200 --> 24:05.440
I've always found that too much
is exactly enough.

24:29.800 --> 24:30.720
Needs paprika.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.560
Needs paprika.

24:34.960 --> 24:37.080
Yeah, you are good company, Piotr.

24:37.920 --> 24:39.680
Run along now, clean something.

24:40.960 --> 24:41.800
Yes, sir.

24:45.520 --> 24:47.000
My friends call me Victor.

24:48.640 --> 24:50.800
All right... Victor.

24:52.360 --> 24:53.960
I said my friends call me that.

24:54.920 --> 24:55.760
Sorry.

24:59.520 --> 25:01.520
Jesus, it's too easy.

25:02.280 --> 25:03.480
Get away now.

25:17.880 --> 25:20.240
Oh, I did not know you were there.

25:20.320 --> 25:22.160
You sure about that boy?

25:25.760 --> 25:28.320
Well, he's a good lad, really.

25:28.400 --> 25:31.600
-You think?
-Well, Romanian.

25:33.120 --> 25:34.960
Maybe he brought the bad luck.

25:35.840 --> 25:37.000
A Jonah.

25:37.520 --> 25:39.000
Or maybe the second mate.

25:39.080 --> 25:40.080
Why?

25:40.160 --> 25:41.320
Romanian.

25:41.400 --> 25:44.040
Yeah. But there's women.

25:44.600 --> 25:47.880
It's usually women who bring the bad luck.

25:49.320 --> 25:52.520
Well, that's half the ship
we've managed to accuse.

25:52.600 --> 25:53.640
Anybody else?

25:55.160 --> 25:56.320
Rest of the passengers.

25:56.400 --> 25:59.040
Yes, passengers.

26:04.680 --> 26:05.640
Seven of them.

26:08.280 --> 26:10.120
Seven passengers...

26:11.680 --> 26:12.760
on the Demeter.

26:13.600 --> 26:14.960
Six now.

26:28.120 --> 26:29.600
So, what was your next move?

26:29.680 --> 26:32.840
<i> I told you, I treasure youth,</i>

26:32.920 --> 26:36.880
<i>and the night was warm</i>
<i>and full of possibilities.</i>

27:52.120 --> 27:55.280
There are monsters in this world, Yamini.

27:56.160 --> 27:59.160
Creatures that will leave
a shadow on your soul

27:59.600 --> 28:00.960
if once you let them in.

28:03.680 --> 28:05.760
I will never let them take you.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.320
I swear it.

28:30.640 --> 28:31.760
Good evening.

28:31.840 --> 28:34.800
You shouldn't be here, ma'am.
Captain's orders.

28:35.440 --> 28:36.720
It's so warm down there.

28:38.720 --> 28:39.640
Where are we?

28:40.200 --> 28:41.680
Just off the coast of Greece.

28:45.360 --> 28:46.760
May I take a turn around the deck?

28:47.400 --> 28:48.280
Please.

28:49.240 --> 28:50.200
Just watch out.

28:51.480 --> 28:52.400
I'll be careful.

29:01.680 --> 29:04.720
Don't dream. Don't dream.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.960
- Warm night, isn't it?
- My God.

29:17.640 --> 29:20.680
Ah, no. I can make no such claims.

29:22.200 --> 29:25.400
I'm sorry. We haven't met.
I'm Count Dracula.

29:25.480 --> 29:26.480
Lady Ruthven.

29:29.040 --> 29:30.040
You know...

29:30.920 --> 29:32.760
really, I shouldn't be alone
with you like this.

29:32.840 --> 29:35.680
My husband tells me two people
have disappeared.

29:36.520 --> 29:39.200
And here we are, two people.

29:41.160 --> 29:42.840
I've not been well, I'm afraid.

29:44.160 --> 29:47.080
The sea, it... makes me feel wretched.

29:48.440 --> 29:50.400
-But I'm better tonight.
-No.

29:50.480 --> 29:52.200
Tonight, you're superb.

29:53.760 --> 29:57.080
Your husband is a very, very lucky man.

29:57.160 --> 29:59.280
Certainly he is,

30:00.920 --> 30:01.960
but I'm lucky too.

30:03.080 --> 30:06.200
He's so handsome,
and there'll be children.

30:06.280 --> 30:08.240
We'll have lots of children.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.800
Must sound terribly ordinary
to a man like you, talk of children.

30:16.200 --> 30:18.720
To a man like me,
it sounds like a miracle.

30:20.560 --> 30:21.880
Dear me,

30:22.680 --> 30:26.040
something about you
positively demands...

30:27.040 --> 30:28.240
intimacy.

30:31.160 --> 30:38.040
Should newly married ladies
really be conversing on intimate matters

30:38.120 --> 30:39.960
with handsome strangers?

30:40.040 --> 30:41.280
I see no harm in it.

30:42.720 --> 30:46.160
Unless it happens to be a dangerous,
handsome stranger.

30:46.680 --> 30:47.680
Are you dangerous?

30:47.760 --> 30:50.280
-Yes, I am terribly dangerous.

30:50.360 --> 30:55.480
Like one of those exotic noblemen
one reads about in the novels,

30:55.560 --> 30:59.560
filled with all the mystery and wickedness
of the East.

31:00.600 --> 31:01.560
Yes.

31:04.560 --> 31:07.880
- We're going to America.
-Oh, indeed?

31:08.800 --> 31:10.480
-A new world.
-Hmm.

31:10.560 --> 31:11.520
A new life.

31:12.080 --> 31:13.520
That's a pity.

31:15.120 --> 31:15.960
Why?

31:17.160 --> 31:18.320
I'm a vampire.

31:19.600 --> 31:21.920
Sorry, what did you say?

31:22.000 --> 31:23.480
Take a look in the mirror.

31:23.560 --> 31:24.760
What mirror?

31:25.240 --> 31:27.640
One can always find a mirror if one tries.

31:33.320 --> 31:34.200
There.

31:42.000 --> 31:42.840
That's...

31:43.640 --> 31:44.840
How'd you do that?

31:45.320 --> 31:46.840
Mirrors are a deeper

31:46.920 --> 31:50.360
and more dangerous magic
than most people understand.

31:51.040 --> 31:53.840
Mirrors can give a space to imagine
or worse...

31:55.280 --> 31:56.600
show us the truth.

31:58.760 --> 32:00.520
What do you see in the mirror?

32:00.600 --> 32:01.520
Much.

32:02.920 --> 32:06.440
I thought you deserved at least a glimpse
of what might have been.

32:06.520 --> 32:07.760
What might have been?

32:09.840 --> 32:10.880
Why do you say that?

32:10.960 --> 32:15.400
I told you, lovely Dorabella.

32:18.560 --> 32:20.040
I'm a vampire.

33:05.920 --> 33:07.640
-Pig.
<i>-</i>Sorry?

33:07.720 --> 33:09.400
Well, four weeks to England,

33:09.480 --> 33:11.840
and you'd already polished off
three people in two nights,

33:11.920 --> 33:13.880
like a fox in a hen coop.

33:13.960 --> 33:17.000
Like a connoisseur in a wine cellar.

33:17.080 --> 33:20.800
One chooses one's vintages with care,
the reds and the whites.

33:20.880 --> 33:24.360
I enjoy both the duchess and the deckhand.

33:24.440 --> 33:26.400
But you're careful with your diet?

33:26.480 --> 33:28.400
Well, I have to be.

33:28.480 --> 33:30.280
Otherwise, I would have reached England

33:30.360 --> 33:32.840
with the social skills
of a Russian sailor.

33:33.440 --> 33:36.480
And yet, you were gorging yourself.
Fox, hen coop.

33:37.040 --> 33:39.160
Pig, truffles.

33:39.240 --> 33:41.680
At this rate,
there'd be no one left to sail the ship.

33:42.400 --> 33:45.160
I knew I could get by
with a skeleton crew.

33:46.680 --> 33:48.240
I've worked with those before.

33:56.840 --> 33:58.520
She said she was too warm.

33:59.720 --> 34:02.480
-I told her to be careful.
- And you saw nothing?

34:02.560 --> 34:05.160
No, sir.
Nothing from where I was standing.

34:07.800 --> 34:10.360
This is preposterous. Where is she?

34:10.800 --> 34:13.480
Hmm? What has happened to my wife?

34:14.560 --> 34:16.240
- What about Lisbon?
- Lisbon's two days away.

34:16.320 --> 34:18.520
We go on to England

34:18.600 --> 34:19.760
and double the watch.

34:20.240 --> 34:22.320
No one is to walk the decks alone,
understood?

34:22.400 --> 34:23.440
Aye, sir.

34:23.520 --> 34:26.480
We are forced to assume
that there is a murderer on board.

34:26.560 --> 34:29.680
We can, I fear, place no trust anywhere.

34:33.080 --> 34:36.680
Now, young lady,
you seem particularly upset.

34:39.400 --> 34:41.280
Did you see something which alarmed you?

34:43.720 --> 34:46.480
She can't hear you.
She only understands sign language.

34:47.040 --> 34:51.640
That is a language I must acquire...
sometime.

34:52.920 --> 34:54.760
This is more than murder.

34:55.440 --> 34:58.480
There is evil at work on this ship.

34:58.560 --> 34:59.560
Look out there.

35:00.240 --> 35:01.520
Look at it.

35:02.480 --> 35:05.640
What sort of fog follows a ship?

35:05.720 --> 35:09.320
I agree, there is evil at work,
but surely it's a very human evil.

35:09.400 --> 35:11.880
-Three people are dead.
-Three people are missing.

35:11.960 --> 35:15.040
And where did they go?
Did they sprout wings and fly away?

35:15.480 --> 35:17.520
What a ridiculous idea.

35:18.320 --> 35:20.360
Dark forces.

35:20.440 --> 35:23.600
Those dark forces took my Dorabella.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.360
I find it hard to credit

35:30.440 --> 35:34.240
that any supernatural entity would leave
such a quantity of blood behind,

35:34.320 --> 35:36.600
unless, of course, it has drunk its fill.

35:36.680 --> 35:38.080
So, gentlemen...

35:39.880 --> 35:41.200
there is a killer on board.

35:44.920 --> 35:48.640
In plain sight... or hiding.

35:49.200 --> 35:50.200
We'll search everywhere.

35:50.280 --> 35:53.120
No one can stay hidden long
on a ship this size.

35:53.200 --> 35:55.920
Perhaps we should start
with cabin number nine.

35:57.760 --> 35:59.440
There is nothing of consequence in there.

35:59.520 --> 36:00.960
Mmm, nevertheless,

36:01.040 --> 36:04.760
I'm sure it'll set all our minds at rest
if we just took a little look,

36:04.840 --> 36:07.160
since we're all obliged
to suspect everyone,

36:07.240 --> 36:09.560
including you, Captain Sokolov.

36:10.760 --> 36:13.800
I see no need to exclude the passenger
in number nine.

36:16.760 --> 36:20.000
Very well. Cabin nine will be searched.

36:21.280 --> 36:22.480
By me.

36:23.280 --> 36:25.280
Then I suppose we'll have to trust you.

36:28.720 --> 36:31.600
<i>I don't understand.</i>
<i>You wanted them to search number nine?</i>

36:32.440 --> 36:34.680
<i>I assumed number nine was your cabin.</i>

36:35.160 --> 36:36.080
<i>Did you?</i>

36:38.240 --> 36:39.440
The stench.

36:40.040 --> 36:42.200
A sick room is not a place
for weak stomachs.

36:42.280 --> 36:43.280
Stay where you are.

36:53.640 --> 36:54.760
What can you hear?

36:56.560 --> 36:57.400
Breathing.

36:58.560 --> 36:59.520
The captain's?

37:02.280 --> 37:03.120
No.

37:19.720 --> 37:20.560
Well, sir?

37:20.880 --> 37:24.120
All as before.
Passenger remains very sick,

37:24.200 --> 37:26.040
and there is no one else in the cabin.

37:26.120 --> 37:27.560
I searched it thoroughly.

37:27.640 --> 37:28.960
Does that satisfy you?

37:30.320 --> 37:32.440
The captain's word is good enough for me.

37:36.040 --> 37:36.880
And me.

37:38.720 --> 37:39.920
For now.

37:59.840 --> 38:03.040
Well, it seems to be
just common, old garden soil.

38:04.680 --> 38:07.280
It's not fuller's earth
or anything like that.

38:07.360 --> 38:08.920
Ah, of course.

38:09.560 --> 38:10.840
You're a scientist.

38:11.320 --> 38:13.120
At University of Calcutta.

38:14.240 --> 38:15.280
Or I was.

38:16.320 --> 38:17.920
Are you perhaps a scientist yourself?

38:18.480 --> 38:20.640
Uh, I have an appetite for it.

38:21.520 --> 38:23.640
Science doesn't know everything.

38:24.200 --> 38:25.160
Hmm.

38:25.240 --> 38:26.960
What do you reckon about all this?

38:27.440 --> 38:30.000
You must have seen some strange things
in your time.

38:30.080 --> 38:32.040
Ah, now we come to it.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.480
Ask the savage. He'll know.

38:35.080 --> 38:38.040
-He sees around corners.
-Well, it's true, isn't it?

38:38.600 --> 38:41.960
All that black magic your people
get up to?

38:43.040 --> 38:44.480
My people?

38:51.240 --> 38:54.880
Trust, once lost,
cannot easily be restored.

38:54.960 --> 38:55.960
I know that.

38:56.680 --> 38:59.520
But we've all searched this ship
from prow to stern.

38:59.600 --> 39:02.080
There's no sign of our missing friends.

39:02.160 --> 39:03.040
We're all agreed?

39:03.560 --> 39:05.520
Which means only one thing.

39:05.600 --> 39:06.520
I'm afraid so.

39:08.160 --> 39:09.160
It's one of us.

39:11.400 --> 39:13.200
It is clear what we must do.

39:13.920 --> 39:15.760
We must go on to England,

39:15.840 --> 39:18.120
and we'll hand this matter over
to the authorities.

39:18.200 --> 39:19.440
If we stick together

39:19.520 --> 39:21.360
and we're all careful.
If no one is alone--

39:22.600 --> 39:25.080
-Must have fallen from the moonrakers.

39:25.160 --> 39:26.120
Jesus.

39:26.200 --> 39:27.360
-Over here.
-Dr. Sharma?

39:27.440 --> 39:28.840
I'm no surgeon.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
-Fetch Valentin. Get him below.

39:31.760 --> 39:34.000
Quickly, he's bleeding.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.760
Step away, man,
if you can't stand the sight of blood.

39:37.720 --> 39:39.520
<i>And you can't stand it, can you?</i>

39:40.160 --> 39:42.360
<i>You can't control yourself</i>
<i>in the presence of blood.</i>

39:42.440 --> 39:44.000
It's not just sustenance.

39:44.560 --> 39:45.640
It's an addiction.

39:46.800 --> 39:47.760
You're smiling.

39:48.440 --> 39:52.440
After 400 years,
it's nice to be understood.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.280
Oh, no, I haven't understood you yet.

39:54.360 --> 39:55.440
Not completely.

39:56.040 --> 39:59.280
Seven very different passengers
on the Demeter.

40:00.640 --> 40:03.000
How convenient,
given your dietary requirements.

40:05.800 --> 40:06.760
Put him here!

40:11.120 --> 40:13.120
How could you fall? You, of all people.

40:13.200 --> 40:15.480
It's the fog. It's like breathing poison.

40:15.960 --> 40:16.840
Fix it.

40:16.920 --> 40:19.200
-Just fix it.
-I'll try and reset it.

40:19.280 --> 40:22.000
But it doesn't change anything.
The Devil is on this ship.

40:22.080 --> 40:23.440
-The Devil!
-Do it!

40:23.760 --> 40:24.720
Bite.

40:25.040 --> 40:26.000
Hold him.

40:45.720 --> 40:47.840
Good evening, Count Dracula.

40:51.360 --> 40:52.720
Are you all right?

41:04.280 --> 41:07.920
I suppose we're all a little jumpy.

41:21.520 --> 41:22.400
Not hungry?

41:56.920 --> 41:57.840
Olgaren...

41:59.600 --> 42:00.520
might I ask,

42:00.600 --> 42:02.880
do you normally have this many passengers?

42:04.040 --> 42:04.880
No.

42:06.240 --> 42:07.520
It is very strange.<i> </i>

42:08.400 --> 42:10.160
This is the most we've ever had,

42:10.640 --> 42:11.880
and the most wealthy.

42:13.160 --> 42:16.120
And Lord Ruthven is, I assume,
the wealthiest.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.000
Why did you choose this ship?

42:18.080 --> 42:21.560
It was a recommendation
from my business partner.

42:21.640 --> 42:22.960
I have a silent partner.

42:23.040 --> 42:24.640
Who recommends the Demeter?

42:24.720 --> 42:26.480
I didn't think to question it.

42:26.560 --> 42:27.640
Why not?

42:27.720 --> 42:29.320
Thanks to this partner's sponsorship,

42:29.400 --> 42:35.200
Lord Ruthven had the funds
and, uh, position to woo Dorabella.

42:35.280 --> 42:37.720
Lord Ruthven didn't question anything.

42:37.800 --> 42:40.160
What does it matter? A ship is a ship.

42:40.680 --> 42:42.400
I'm sure Mr. Balaur has his reasons.

42:43.840 --> 42:46.280
What did you say? Balaur?

42:46.360 --> 42:48.280
Yes, my silent partner.

42:48.920 --> 42:50.240
And my sponsor.

42:51.880 --> 42:52.800
Well...

42:54.920 --> 42:57.880
-That is quite a coincidence.
-Count Dracula, do you have any connec--

42:59.800 --> 43:01.760
<i>Ah, the beast revealed.</i>

43:01.840 --> 43:05.080
<i>Ravenous for blood</i>
<i>and stinking of grave dirt.</i>

43:05.160 --> 43:08.360
A sophisticated gentleman,
nothing more than a veneer.

43:08.440 --> 43:13.280
The sophistication of a gentleman, Agatha,
is always a veneer.

43:13.360 --> 43:15.560
Even a gentleman like Mr. Balaur?

43:16.360 --> 43:17.800
-Mr. who?
-Dracula,

43:18.280 --> 43:20.320
a corruption of the Latin <i>dracul,</i>

43:20.400 --> 43:22.960
meaning dragon. In Romanian, <i>balaur.</i>

43:23.880 --> 43:26.720
The purpose of an alias
seems to have eluded you.

43:26.800 --> 43:28.320
I thought it was clever.

43:28.400 --> 43:30.600
Ah, you'll have to be cleverer than that.

43:30.680 --> 43:34.480
To feed off the civilized, you'll have
to learn to live with them first. Ha!

43:34.960 --> 43:37.520
The boat was a dress rehearsal
for life in England.

43:38.200 --> 43:41.840
You stocked your larder to teach yourself
to dine with restraint.

43:42.240 --> 43:45.080
-Precisely.
-And, Mr. Balaur,

43:45.840 --> 43:47.400
your restraint was failing you.

43:49.320 --> 43:51.320
You see, not the losing side.

44:23.880 --> 44:25.760
What are you looking at?

44:28.000 --> 44:29.360
This ship is cursed.

44:29.800 --> 44:30.840
It is doomed.

44:32.680 --> 44:34.080
Find everyone who thinks the same.

44:34.160 --> 44:36.280
Bring them here.
There is only one way out.

44:36.360 --> 44:37.320
Yes, Valentin.

45:05.680 --> 45:06.520
Ma'am?

45:07.880 --> 45:08.760
Hush.

45:09.640 --> 45:10.920
-But I thought--
-Hush now.

45:12.640 --> 45:13.480
You're dead.

45:14.320 --> 45:16.080
Everyone's dead in the end.

45:18.040 --> 45:19.160
I'm dreaming.

45:19.840 --> 45:20.920
This isn't real.

45:22.440 --> 45:25.000
Reality is overrated.

45:37.640 --> 45:39.840
No. No, please.

45:39.920 --> 45:41.160
Shh.

45:41.720 --> 45:43.960
Thought you'd never answer back.

45:44.040 --> 45:45.600
No!

46:10.160 --> 46:12.400
What normal man could have done this?

46:12.960 --> 46:17.200
We will need to search the ship again.
I want the entire crew in pairs.

46:17.280 --> 46:18.920
I don't think that's going
to be possible, sir.

46:19.360 --> 46:21.440
It's possible if I give the order!

46:21.520 --> 46:23.120
One of the lifeboats is missing.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.240
And, I think,

46:26.120 --> 46:27.160
most of the crew.

46:29.920 --> 46:31.440
But where could they go?

46:32.040 --> 46:33.160
Anywhere but here.

46:37.040 --> 46:37.880
Sir?

46:39.160 --> 46:40.000
Yuri?

46:40.920 --> 46:41.760
It's time.

46:43.640 --> 46:44.920
What are you talking about?

46:45.000 --> 46:46.840
Who is in cabin number nine?

46:52.200 --> 46:55.000
When did I lose so many pieces?
I was winning.

46:55.320 --> 46:58.280
No, you've been losing from the start.

46:59.280 --> 47:00.200
You don't drink.

47:00.880 --> 47:01.760
Wine.

47:04.600 --> 47:07.280
Uh, the pawn is well-placed.

47:07.360 --> 47:10.960
If I can get it to the other side,
it becomes another queen.

47:11.040 --> 47:14.040
Forget about the chess,
and concentrate on the game.

47:15.320 --> 47:16.920
Who's in cabin number nine?

47:23.920 --> 47:25.720
How-- How did I get here?

47:28.080 --> 47:29.040
Don't you remember?

47:30.880 --> 47:32.360
We were at the convent.

47:34.080 --> 47:35.640
You let Mina go.

47:35.720 --> 47:38.320
-I said run. Go, now!

47:38.800 --> 47:41.080
Yes, but I didn't let you go, did I?

47:42.440 --> 47:45.720
-Where am I? What is this place?
-Ah...

47:45.800 --> 47:47.480
Surely you know where you are.

47:48.760 --> 47:49.960
The people you feed on,

47:50.960 --> 47:52.000
you make them dream.

47:52.560 --> 47:54.520
The kiss of the vampire...

47:54.960 --> 47:56.080
<i>is an opiate.</i>

48:01.640 --> 48:02.960
Are you drinking my blood?

48:11.320 --> 48:12.240
Agatha,

48:14.000 --> 48:15.320
you're exquisite.

48:15.920 --> 48:18.520
So much insight,

48:19.080 --> 48:21.480
wit, learning,

48:23.200 --> 48:24.600
wickedness, even.

48:30.920 --> 48:34.720
One does not hurry such a vintage.

48:36.400 --> 48:38.000
I've been making you last.

48:42.720 --> 48:43.640
It's me.

48:45.320 --> 48:46.960
I'm in cabin number nine.

49:10.320 --> 49:12.360
I told you, there's nobody in here.

49:16.800 --> 49:21.080
Gentlemen, I'm afraid
I took matters into my own hands.

49:21.840 --> 49:22.880
Please, come in.

49:38.800 --> 49:40.560
Let me save you some time.

49:40.640 --> 49:43.200
Do any of you recognize these?

49:44.520 --> 49:45.880
Portmann's kerchief.

49:45.960 --> 49:47.040
I'd know it anywhere.

49:48.360 --> 49:49.280
And, look.

49:52.120 --> 49:53.680
The Grand Duchess's.

49:53.760 --> 49:55.520
I saw it the night she disappeared.

49:55.600 --> 49:57.080
Those weren't here before.

49:58.680 --> 50:01.000
-Trophies.
-Trophies, exactly.

50:01.600 --> 50:04.640
As if all this was nothing
but a sick game.

50:04.720 --> 50:07.840
I submit this is all the evidence we need.

50:09.200 --> 50:10.680
And here she is...

50:11.920 --> 50:14.360
Drenched in the blood of her victims.

50:17.280 --> 50:18.480
The murderer.

50:27.480 --> 50:29.320
Anything to say before we hang you?

50:29.400 --> 50:32.320
For God's sake, you saw her.
She could barely lift her head.

50:32.400 --> 50:35.200
-What are you doing?
-Captain, with respect, stay out of it.

50:35.280 --> 50:37.880
-You kept the murderer safe on this ship.
-Look at her.

50:37.960 --> 50:40.200
How could she have the strength
to kill those men?

50:40.280 --> 50:42.680
Looks can be deceiving, Dr. Sharma.

50:42.760 --> 50:43.840
It can't be her.

50:43.920 --> 50:45.600
Could she have taken Abramoff?

50:45.680 --> 50:47.320
Portmann? Look at her!

50:47.400 --> 50:49.720
It doesn't matter how she looks.
She did it!

50:49.800 --> 50:52.200
-You don't know that.
-Gentlemen, please.

50:52.720 --> 50:55.880
Let us not allow this situation
to turn ugly.

50:55.960 --> 50:57.960
It's a lynching.
How much uglier can it get?

50:58.040 --> 51:01.400
Why do you all listen
to every word this man says?

51:01.480 --> 51:02.680
Why did you protect her?

51:02.760 --> 51:06.440
I got a commission
with certain stipulations.

51:07.040 --> 51:08.000
A commission?

51:08.080 --> 51:11.600
From a man named Balaur, perhaps?

51:12.680 --> 51:16.200
Yes. He said his new wife was very sick.

51:16.280 --> 51:18.280
She needed to travel to England
for treatment.

51:18.360 --> 51:20.800
And he paid handsomely for the Demeter
to take her.

51:20.880 --> 51:23.040
-To take you.
-I am not Mr. Balaur's bride!

51:23.120 --> 51:25.920
- Enough talking, just hang her.
-No, wait, please! Listen.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.480
Olgaren! We are not savages,

51:29.320 --> 51:30.920
and we are not sheep.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.360
You can't hang me.

51:32.440 --> 51:34.280
Give me one reason why not.

51:34.360 --> 51:36.360
Because...  Because...

51:40.120 --> 51:41.360
I'm a vampire.

51:44.800 --> 51:46.400
Oh, funny, do you think?

51:46.880 --> 51:48.240
Well, listen to your captain.

51:48.320 --> 51:50.640
I am a frail and helpless woman.

51:50.720 --> 51:52.520
How did I manage to slaughter four people

51:52.600 --> 51:54.520
and toss
their twitching corpses overboard?

51:55.360 --> 51:57.200
Because I am a vampire.

51:58.120 --> 51:59.760
You know what a vampire is, don't you?

52:01.200 --> 52:04.320
A foul, stinking, slouching monstrosity.

52:05.280 --> 52:08.360
We can disguise ourselves fairly well
as ordinary people

52:09.000 --> 52:11.240
but arouse to a bestial frenzy

52:11.320 --> 52:13.760
by the mere sight and smell
of human blood.

52:13.840 --> 52:15.160
-Enough!
-No, wait.

52:15.240 --> 52:17.680
-No!
-I have experience in these matters.

52:17.760 --> 52:19.520
There is one way to be sure
you are a vampire.

52:19.600 --> 52:22.720
No, listen to me.
I know what I'm talking about.

52:22.800 --> 52:24.200
We can hang you and see if you die.

52:24.280 --> 52:26.560
<i>-</i>You can't hang a vampire.
-No, wait. He's right.

52:26.640 --> 52:27.680
You can't hang me.

52:28.240 --> 52:29.080
I won't die.

52:30.600 --> 52:34.880
And when this farce is over,
you will be the first that I feed on.

52:35.600 --> 52:38.360
And then I will take the rest
of you one by one,

52:39.320 --> 52:41.080
and I will make you last.

52:41.760 --> 52:42.840
Um...

52:42.920 --> 52:44.400
You think I can't?

52:44.480 --> 52:46.840
Think of the four people
I've devoured already.

52:47.240 --> 52:48.800
Are you in a hurry to join them?

52:50.080 --> 52:51.160
Come on, then.

52:52.520 --> 52:55.680
Which of you has the courage
to kick away the barrel?

53:00.480 --> 53:01.400
Me.

53:07.360 --> 53:08.560
Shall we end this?

53:12.560 --> 53:13.960
Cat got your tongue?

53:26.240 --> 53:27.160
Biting my lip.

53:28.840 --> 53:31.040
Look at him!

53:31.680 --> 53:33.760
- I confess I lied to you.

53:34.320 --> 53:36.400
I'm not a vampire. He is.

53:37.640 --> 53:38.840
Count Dracula.

53:40.400 --> 53:43.800
It's him. He is the vampire.

53:44.840 --> 53:50.000
Forgive me if I'm repulsed by the blood
of a murderess when it's spat in my face.

53:50.440 --> 53:51.920
Do what you want with her.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.480
I'll be in my cabin.

53:55.360 --> 53:57.720
Get out of my way, child.

53:57.800 --> 53:59.240
Don't you touch her!

53:59.320 --> 54:00.680
Don't you dare touch her.

54:07.920 --> 54:09.520
Clever girl, sign language.

54:15.240 --> 54:18.880
This is a pity.
I was so enjoying this voyage...

54:20.000 --> 54:20.840
and the people.

54:22.920 --> 54:25.440
And I made a good detective,
don't you think?

54:25.520 --> 54:29.080
I have a particular gift
for eliminating suspects.

54:35.200 --> 54:37.120
Sit up, madam. Sit up, breathe.

54:37.200 --> 54:38.040
Take big breaths.

54:38.120 --> 54:41.160
-Dracula, where did he go?
-Relax now. Breathe deeply.

54:41.240 --> 54:45.120
Where is he? Where's Dracula?
Where did he go? Was no one watching?

54:45.200 --> 54:46.360
We were helping you.

54:46.440 --> 54:49.320
Well, in future,
get your priorities right.

54:49.400 --> 54:51.120
There's a vampire on board this ship.

54:53.000 --> 54:57.000
I am Sister Agatha Van Helsing
of the Saint Mary's Convent, Budapest.

54:57.080 --> 54:58.800
-Captain Sokolov?
-Yes?

54:58.880 --> 55:00.280
You are relieved of command.

55:06.240 --> 55:07.360
Here it is.

55:08.320 --> 55:09.400
Dracula's cabin.

55:10.040 --> 55:11.720
Doesn't look like it's been used.

55:12.200 --> 55:14.240
Although the curtains have been drawn.

55:19.080 --> 55:21.040
Hmm. Are you all right?

55:21.640 --> 55:23.320
No, I'm dying, but don't get distracted.

55:24.000 --> 55:27.440
Dracula needs to sleep in a coffin or box
containing his own native soil.

55:27.520 --> 55:29.680
No idea why.
It doesn't make a lot of sense.

55:30.080 --> 55:31.040
Did you say soil?

55:31.120 --> 55:32.680
Soil, yes.

55:33.160 --> 55:36.640
Somewhere hidden away on this ship,
there must be a box of Transylvanian soil.

55:37.320 --> 55:38.880
Have you seen any such thing?

55:40.200 --> 55:43.080
We have 50 boxes of soil in the hold.

55:46.720 --> 55:49.400
What did you mean,
you have experience in these matters?

55:49.480 --> 55:51.080
My, uh...

55:51.160 --> 55:54.320
My researches have sometimes taken me
down a dark path.

55:56.200 --> 55:58.840
A continuation of life beyond the grave.

55:59.400 --> 56:00.280
The undead.

56:00.960 --> 56:02.240
The <i>nosferatu.</i>

56:03.280 --> 56:04.680
There <i>are </i>such things.

56:07.400 --> 56:10.120
Dracula put us all on this ship together
for a purpose.

56:10.200 --> 56:12.280
Clearly, he chose you for your knowledge.

56:12.920 --> 56:14.840
I wonder what he sees in me.

56:14.920 --> 56:16.360
I have no idea.

56:18.840 --> 56:21.360
But whatever his intentions towards me,

56:22.760 --> 56:24.520
he is not taking my daughter.

56:27.080 --> 56:29.520
-Did you see how he looked at her?
-What is that?

56:31.200 --> 56:32.160
This...

56:32.800 --> 56:33.880
a last resort.

56:34.840 --> 56:38.400
There is death...
and there is undeath.

56:45.240 --> 56:47.440
-Is that the last of them?
-There's one more.

56:47.880 --> 56:49.320
You heard her, one more.

56:50.040 --> 56:50.920
No, wait.

56:52.400 --> 56:55.640
Better still, we leave him one box.

56:55.960 --> 56:57.240
Only one resting place.

56:58.080 --> 56:59.880
Right now, he's hiding in the shadows,

56:59.960 --> 57:02.160
but daylight weakens him.
He will need to rest eventually.

57:02.240 --> 57:05.400
-If there's only one box...
-We can trap him.

57:05.480 --> 57:08.880
Perhaps we can reduce his options,
at least.

57:09.280 --> 57:10.640
Now we must increase ours.

57:10.720 --> 57:13.560
Captain, I assume somewhere on this ship,
you have a Bible.

57:13.640 --> 57:17.600
-I find myself temporarily embarrassed.
-In my cabin.

57:18.040 --> 57:19.040
Please fetch it.

57:19.840 --> 57:22.480
He's a very persuasive man, the Count.

57:24.280 --> 57:25.640
One might almost say...

57:27.440 --> 57:28.600
seductive.

57:28.680 --> 57:30.720
Shouldn't you be on the deck helping?

57:32.320 --> 57:34.920
I'm really not sure where I should be
at the moment.

57:36.040 --> 57:38.640
Perhaps it's time I decided where I stand.

57:40.520 --> 57:44.000
If Count Dracula is Mr. Balaur,

57:44.080 --> 57:46.560
then he is my silent partner.

57:48.160 --> 57:50.240
Perhaps that's what the Count sees in me.

57:50.720 --> 57:51.680
A partner.

57:52.560 --> 57:56.760
And if my intuition is correct,

57:56.840 --> 57:58.160
he is about to join us.

58:02.640 --> 58:03.680
Thank you.

58:03.760 --> 58:04.960
Not at all.

58:05.200 --> 58:07.920
We have a business arrangement.

58:08.440 --> 58:10.480
We are partners.

58:11.960 --> 58:13.600
I should like that to continue.

58:15.120 --> 58:16.040
For how long?

58:17.040 --> 58:21.280
It's my understanding that a vampire
is blessed with eternal life.

58:21.840 --> 58:26.480
Mine too, but it does take
rather a long time to be sure.

58:28.520 --> 58:32.960
You're placing yourself in league
with this creature.

58:33.840 --> 58:34.720
It's business.

58:37.000 --> 58:38.680
-Ah!

58:40.800 --> 58:42.640
We are not stupid, you know.

58:42.720 --> 58:44.520
-I'm a man of science.

58:44.600 --> 58:45.680
Dr. Sharma,

58:45.760 --> 58:49.240
you're one of the great minds of your age,
but you're a prophet without honor

58:49.320 --> 58:50.480
in your own country.

58:51.560 --> 58:52.640
I, however,

58:53.600 --> 58:56.640
recognize your brilliance
and look forward to consuming it.

58:57.080 --> 58:58.520
Never.

58:58.600 --> 59:00.960
-Drop it, now.

59:01.360 --> 59:02.360
Do you hear me?

59:04.920 --> 59:06.920
I would see my daughter die

59:07.000 --> 59:08.960
before letting her become like you.

59:09.040 --> 59:10.640
I wonder if you mean that.

59:11.160 --> 59:14.040
Drop the cross,
or I'll shoot her right in front of you.

59:15.000 --> 59:16.040
You couldn't.

59:17.440 --> 59:19.520
Surrender yourself to us,

59:19.600 --> 59:21.840
or I swear, I will pull this trigger.

59:24.920 --> 59:27.400
What's it to be, man of reason?

59:30.280 --> 59:31.800
Dead or undead?

59:47.400 --> 59:48.880
God forgive me.

59:57.120 --> 59:58.480
No!

1:00:00.480 --> 1:00:01.920
No.

1:00:16.040 --> 1:00:17.120
This thing...

1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:20.240
This Dracula,

1:00:21.120 --> 1:00:22.560
it's only a monster.

1:00:23.800 --> 1:00:25.400
You were supposed to be a man.

1:00:25.800 --> 1:00:27.400
I shall be more than a man.

1:00:45.600 --> 1:00:47.800
Now, look what you've done.

1:00:48.360 --> 1:00:50.360
I... did it for you.

1:00:55.200 --> 1:00:58.800
-Why?
-I thought you'd chosen me.

1:01:01.960 --> 1:01:03.280
I chose you...

1:01:05.960 --> 1:01:06.960
for Dorabella.

1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:12.680
And now you've inherited her money,
I'll inherit it from you.

1:01:17.440 --> 1:01:18.680
-Partner.
-No.

1:01:19.400 --> 1:01:20.840
Thank you for everything.

1:01:20.920 --> 1:01:22.280
No, please.

1:01:24.600 --> 1:01:25.960
Try and stay calm.

1:01:28.800 --> 1:01:30.400
You're doing very well.

1:01:48.720 --> 1:01:49.800
Dr. Sharma?

1:02:20.440 --> 1:02:21.960
I still don't see the point.

1:02:23.320 --> 1:02:24.920
The holy word of our Lord.

1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:26.200
It worked in the convent

1:02:26.280 --> 1:02:29.120
with sacramental bread,
so I suppose we must have faith.

1:02:29.200 --> 1:02:30.600
Is this all we have left?

1:02:31.120 --> 1:02:33.040
Superstition? Fairy tale?

1:02:33.120 --> 1:02:35.440
You saw the effect the cross had on him.

1:02:35.520 --> 1:02:38.440
It's no less of a superstition
because a madman believes it too.

1:02:38.520 --> 1:02:41.040
We have a killer on board,
a human man.

1:02:42.160 --> 1:02:43.280
However delusional.

1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:44.840
Convent?

1:02:45.280 --> 1:02:46.640
I mentioned I was a nun?

1:02:46.720 --> 1:02:49.320
Oh, perfect, she's a nun.

1:02:49.920 --> 1:02:53.360
We need a general.
We need strategy, not nuns.

1:02:55.040 --> 1:02:56.400
You don't seem like a nun.

1:02:56.880 --> 1:02:57.800
It has been said.

1:03:01.960 --> 1:03:02.960
What's wrong, boy?

1:03:03.560 --> 1:03:04.520
What's happened?

1:03:32.520 --> 1:03:33.880
Tears for your master?

1:03:36.720 --> 1:03:38.080
I thought you despised him.

1:03:41.520 --> 1:03:42.800
He wasn't my master.

1:03:45.560 --> 1:03:47.600
Captain Sokolov, please stop frowning.

1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:50.520
How did you know I was frowning?

1:03:50.920 --> 1:03:51.880
It's audible.

1:03:53.120 --> 1:03:55.320
This circle,
that's supposed to protect us.

1:03:55.400 --> 1:03:56.360
I believe it will.

1:03:57.600 --> 1:04:00.160
-You said it worked at the convent.
-Yes.

1:04:00.640 --> 1:04:01.720
And yet, you're here.

1:04:02.840 --> 1:04:03.720
So what happened?

1:04:04.160 --> 1:04:07.440
Dracula gained entry by disguising himself
in the skin of...

1:04:09.400 --> 1:04:10.280
of another.

1:04:11.560 --> 1:04:12.480
Sister Agatha?

1:04:16.120 --> 1:04:17.280
Piotr.

1:04:18.960 --> 1:04:19.920
Wake up, boy.

1:04:23.120 --> 1:04:25.920
If you please,
tell me again what happened below decks.

1:04:27.560 --> 1:04:31.320
I think you came across Dracula
feeding off the Englishman, correct?

1:04:33.640 --> 1:04:34.480
Yes.

1:04:36.240 --> 1:04:37.480
And Dracula saw you?

1:04:40.280 --> 1:04:41.160
Yes.

1:04:43.640 --> 1:04:44.880
And then he let you go?

1:04:47.920 --> 1:04:48.760
Yes.

1:04:48.840 --> 1:04:50.520
May one ask why?

1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:53.960
-I don't know.
- No, Piotr.

1:04:54.880 --> 1:04:56.240
I don't know either.

1:04:58.080 --> 1:05:00.680
Go on, Piotr, you just have to explain.

1:05:00.760 --> 1:05:04.760
I told you.
He was drinking Lord Ruthven's blood.

1:05:06.120 --> 1:05:07.440
He was busy.

1:05:08.160 --> 1:05:09.000
Busy?

1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:10.920
Yes.

1:05:14.160 --> 1:05:15.000
I ran.

1:05:16.720 --> 1:05:18.320
I don't think he cared about me.

1:05:20.120 --> 1:05:21.040
Just let me go.

1:05:26.960 --> 1:05:28.280
Olgaren, what's going on?

1:05:29.360 --> 1:05:30.200
Victor?

1:05:31.720 --> 1:05:35.440
Just try to explain, boy.

1:05:35.520 --> 1:05:36.520
I have explained.

1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:38.720
-That's all there is.
- Piotr,

1:05:39.280 --> 1:05:44.120
we just need to be sure
that you haven't been contaminated.

1:05:44.200 --> 1:05:45.160
Occupied.

1:05:46.840 --> 1:05:49.520
I saw Dracula climb
from the belly of a wolf once.

1:05:50.280 --> 1:05:51.240
We need to be sure.

1:05:53.320 --> 1:05:54.520
How do we do that?

1:05:54.600 --> 1:05:58.040
Piotr, you entered the circle
before it was complete, yes?

1:05:58.120 --> 1:05:59.000
I think so.

1:06:00.120 --> 1:06:01.320
I didn't really notice.

1:06:01.400 --> 1:06:02.720
Now the circle is closed.

1:06:02.800 --> 1:06:06.360
A vampire would be unable to cross
the line of it in any circumstances.

1:06:09.080 --> 1:06:12.000
Piotr, step outside the circle.

1:06:14.320 --> 1:06:15.240
But...

1:06:17.200 --> 1:06:19.640
you said it wasn't safe.

1:06:19.720 --> 1:06:22.920
-No. You cannot do this to the boy.
-Only for a moment.

1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:23.920
Piotr...

1:06:25.040 --> 1:06:26.360
step outside the circle.

1:06:26.920 --> 1:06:27.840
That's an order.

1:06:28.320 --> 1:06:31.000
Come on, just cross the line for a moment,
in and out.

1:06:32.560 --> 1:06:33.400
Do it.

1:06:33.880 --> 1:06:35.040
Now.

1:06:43.240 --> 1:06:45.120
Well done, boy. Get back inside.

1:06:45.200 --> 1:06:46.280
No, both feet.

1:07:01.400 --> 1:07:02.880
That was hilarious.

1:07:02.960 --> 1:07:04.960
God protect us.

1:07:05.040 --> 1:07:07.000
This again?

1:07:08.040 --> 1:07:09.520
Tedious book.

1:07:10.040 --> 1:07:10.920
What do you want?

1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:13.040
Ah, what I always want.

1:07:13.120 --> 1:07:14.960
Something to eat, a bit of company.

1:07:15.680 --> 1:07:17.600
Your boxes have been destroyed.

1:07:17.680 --> 1:07:19.680
You have no refuge, no place of solace.

1:07:19.760 --> 1:07:22.920
I notice that one of my boxes is still
in the hold.

1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:25.520
Oh, you're welcome to sleep in it
anytime you like.

1:07:26.840 --> 1:07:27.840
We won't wake you.

1:07:29.720 --> 1:07:30.600
I see.

1:07:31.440 --> 1:07:33.440
You left it there as a lure.

1:07:36.080 --> 1:07:37.360
I'm going to miss you.

1:07:37.840 --> 1:07:39.640
I'll spare you the heartache.

1:07:39.720 --> 1:07:40.840
Too kind.

1:07:42.320 --> 1:07:43.160
Well,

1:07:44.680 --> 1:07:47.800
I wonder which of you it's going to be.

1:07:47.880 --> 1:07:48.920
Which of us what?

1:07:50.360 --> 1:07:53.240
One of you is going to break.
The night is young.

1:07:55.160 --> 1:07:57.600
You expect us to give ourselves up to you?

1:07:57.680 --> 1:07:58.640
Yes.

1:07:59.720 --> 1:08:02.320
-But why?
- What's the alternative?

1:08:02.760 --> 1:08:04.280
It's only a matter of time.

1:08:04.720 --> 1:08:05.880
Come on.

1:08:06.640 --> 1:08:08.680
Don't you at least want a good death?

1:08:08.760 --> 1:08:11.600
Take your chances, die fighting,
die in battle

1:08:11.680 --> 1:08:13.720
like every living thing is supposed to?

1:08:14.440 --> 1:08:18.280
Surely, it's better
than this dreary stalemate.

1:08:18.360 --> 1:08:20.880
Not a stalemate, Count Dracula.

1:08:22.080 --> 1:08:26.240
We have an advantage over you,
or at least I do.

1:08:27.320 --> 1:08:29.160
Alone on this boat, it seems...

1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:32.360
I'm not a lunatic.

1:08:37.680 --> 1:08:38.880
Ah...

1:08:40.600 --> 1:08:44.160
Now... now you interest me.

1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:50.040
Pages from an old book,
nailed to the deck,

1:08:50.120 --> 1:08:51.520
and you can't walk past them?

1:08:51.600 --> 1:08:57.400
Your conflict, your disbelief,
your skepticism is a strong flavor.

1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:00.240
Intoxicating.

1:09:00.320 --> 1:09:03.600
-Don't let him confuse you, Adisa.
-I am not confused.

1:09:03.680 --> 1:09:05.560
This man killed Tom.

1:09:06.040 --> 1:09:07.200
Lord Ruthven. He...

1:09:07.960 --> 1:09:10.920
He took the love of my life,
and I will not play his games.

1:09:13.240 --> 1:09:15.440
Where is he? What have you done with him?

1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:18.840
Fish bait.

1:09:19.680 --> 1:09:21.080
Like the rest of them.

1:09:21.160 --> 1:09:24.120
One learns to keep a tidy slaughterhouse.

1:09:24.200 --> 1:09:25.880
Now, Adisa, tell me.

1:09:26.800 --> 1:09:28.320
What do you see before you?

1:09:29.200 --> 1:09:30.040
A man.

1:09:30.120 --> 1:09:31.920
Aw, only that?

1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:33.200
Less than that.

1:09:35.040 --> 1:09:36.040
A murderer.

1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:40.640
If you are so confident
and if you are so angry,

1:09:41.240 --> 1:09:42.720
step outside the circle.

1:09:43.200 --> 1:09:46.080
Even if you don't believe
what is self-evident,

1:09:46.160 --> 1:09:47.640
you know he is dangerous.

1:09:47.720 --> 1:09:50.400
Step outside the circle and dance with me.

1:09:51.320 --> 1:09:53.120
Don't throw your life away
to prove a point!

1:09:54.400 --> 1:09:55.720
That won't do any good.

1:09:55.800 --> 1:09:57.320
They call it a life preserver.

1:09:58.160 --> 1:10:01.440
Well, I have faith in it.
I have faith in steel and powder.

1:10:01.520 --> 1:10:04.560
Fine, try and shoot him,
but from inside the circle.

1:10:04.640 --> 1:10:07.640
We must stay strong and united
and inside the circle!

1:10:07.720 --> 1:10:11.440
Yes, stay inside the circle.

1:10:11.520 --> 1:10:15.320
Do as you're told.
Do as they tell you, as you always do,

1:10:15.400 --> 1:10:18.480
'cause that's what you're good at,
'cause you're a servant. Hmm.

1:10:19.160 --> 1:10:22.960
However stupid your masters were,
however beautiful,

1:10:23.040 --> 1:10:26.120
you're destined to remain in the shadows.

1:10:27.600 --> 1:10:28.960
A guilty secret.

1:10:31.080 --> 1:10:32.360
Don't! No!

1:10:34.640 --> 1:10:36.280
I knew you could do it.

1:10:37.760 --> 1:10:39.320
Your own man at the end.

1:10:39.400 --> 1:10:41.520
Come back. Come back inside.

1:10:43.440 --> 1:10:44.760
This is an execution.

1:10:47.360 --> 1:10:48.480
This is for Tom.

1:11:01.240 --> 1:11:02.520
Ow.

1:11:30.280 --> 1:11:32.840
Keep him down.
Keep him on the deck, Olgaren.

1:11:32.920 --> 1:11:34.160
-Knife!
-Knife!

1:11:39.600 --> 1:11:40.560
Count Dracula!

1:11:42.160 --> 1:11:43.080
Go to hell.

1:12:45.880 --> 1:12:46.920
Where's Olgaren?

1:12:48.480 --> 1:12:49.840
-Cooking.
-Oh.

1:12:50.840 --> 1:12:52.920
Just when you think you're out of danger.

1:12:54.960 --> 1:12:55.840
And the sister?

1:12:58.200 --> 1:12:59.040
The usual.

1:13:01.200 --> 1:13:02.160
Take the wheel.

1:13:25.960 --> 1:13:28.880
-How long are you going to keep checking?
-Till I'm sure.

1:13:29.720 --> 1:13:32.040
-It's been a week.
-But if he survived,

1:13:32.120 --> 1:13:34.040
it would take time for him to heal
those wounds.

1:13:34.120 --> 1:13:35.480
But according to you,

1:13:35.560 --> 1:13:38.680
he could only do so lying in a bed
of his own earth.

1:13:39.240 --> 1:13:41.840
That is the only one on board. Have faith.

1:13:42.640 --> 1:13:43.720
I struggle with faith.

1:13:45.960 --> 1:13:48.640
We're a few hours from Whitby.
Do you want to join us on deck?

1:13:48.720 --> 1:13:50.480
You still have one lifeboat left, yes?

1:13:50.560 --> 1:13:52.080
Yes, why?

1:13:52.160 --> 1:13:54.200
Because this ship
must never reach England.

1:13:55.520 --> 1:13:56.760
What are you talking about?

1:13:56.840 --> 1:14:00.400
Your cargo, I've been going through it.
We have here everything we need.

1:14:00.920 --> 1:14:03.880
-For a doll's tea party?
- No.

1:14:04.440 --> 1:14:06.360
Saltpeter, sulfur, charcoal.

1:14:07.240 --> 1:14:08.240
For gunpowder?

1:14:08.320 --> 1:14:11.040
Well, there's at least enough to blow
a decent-sized hole in the hull,

1:14:11.120 --> 1:14:12.000
don't you think?

1:14:20.320 --> 1:14:21.920
That might be quite a good spot.

1:14:23.040 --> 1:14:25.120
That would take her down, all right.

1:14:25.760 --> 1:14:26.680
But why?

1:14:27.920 --> 1:14:32.120
No trace of the vampire's foul contagion
can be allowed to reach the New World.

1:14:32.200 --> 1:14:33.400
Trust me on this.

1:14:33.880 --> 1:14:35.520
We must sink the Demeter.

1:14:35.600 --> 1:14:37.480
When will you accept that you've won?

1:14:38.040 --> 1:14:39.200
When I'm dead.

1:14:42.880 --> 1:14:45.680
The curse of the vampire lives inside me.

1:14:47.480 --> 1:14:49.800
Under no circumstances can I come
with you to England.

1:14:50.200 --> 1:14:52.480
No. Agatha, no.

1:14:52.560 --> 1:14:55.360
-I refuse--
-Tell them of Dracula if you wish.

1:14:55.440 --> 1:14:57.720
Tell them what happened here
on board the Demeter.

1:14:58.440 --> 1:15:00.120
But tell no one where it lies.

1:15:00.600 --> 1:15:04.000
Better still, tell them it sank
somewhere else far from here.

1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.160
We must protect the curious
from themselves.

1:15:07.240 --> 1:15:10.040
<i>-</i>But he's dead.
-Consider this a plague ship.

1:15:10.120 --> 1:15:11.920
All precautions must be taken.

1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:14.160
No more words.

1:15:14.880 --> 1:15:18.560
Explain what's happening to Olgaren
and Piotr, and get off this ship.

1:15:19.280 --> 1:15:21.480
You can leave the arrangement
of the gunpowder to me.

1:15:23.160 --> 1:15:26.960
Now, go now. I don't have all day,
quite literally, as it turns out.

1:15:27.040 --> 1:15:28.080
Sister Agatha?

1:15:28.160 --> 1:15:29.080
No more.

1:15:35.040 --> 1:15:36.120
I'm a nun.

1:15:37.800 --> 1:15:38.640
You mentioned.

1:15:58.520 --> 1:15:59.360
It's not right.

1:16:01.800 --> 1:16:02.640
I know,

1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:05.080
but it must be done.

1:16:05.760 --> 1:16:09.280
-But Sister Agatha--
-God will take care of Sister Agatha...

1:16:10.480 --> 1:16:12.200
if God knows what's good for him.

1:16:19.560 --> 1:16:21.120
The lifeboat's ready, Captain.

1:16:25.920 --> 1:16:26.960
Lower away.

1:16:47.280 --> 1:16:50.760
I suppose there's time
for one last attempt at conversation.

1:16:51.640 --> 1:16:54.240
One hopes that there's room
for negotiation

1:16:54.320 --> 1:16:56.600
on suicide as a mortal sin.

1:17:23.840 --> 1:17:24.680
Hello?

1:17:27.680 --> 1:17:28.880
Is there someone there?

1:18:28.800 --> 1:18:30.440
Going down with the ship.

1:18:31.240 --> 1:18:34.640
I learned a long time ago
that's the captain's job.

1:18:37.760 --> 1:18:38.760
One for the road?

1:18:42.320 --> 1:18:43.320
One for the road.

1:18:47.280 --> 1:18:48.120
On deck, then.

1:18:58.400 --> 1:18:59.320
A bed.

1:19:02.120 --> 1:19:03.760
A bed of his own earth.

1:19:10.320 --> 1:19:11.320
He's alive.

1:19:14.080 --> 1:19:15.800
Sokolov, he's alive!

1:19:18.800 --> 1:19:20.360
Sokolov isn't.

1:19:20.800 --> 1:19:22.440
I fear I may have bolted him.

1:19:23.040 --> 1:19:23.960
Starving.

1:19:24.880 --> 1:19:28.080
I believe the plan
was for a drink on deck.

1:19:28.560 --> 1:19:31.440
I hope I'm a reasonable substitute.

1:19:46.480 --> 1:19:49.760
Keep him talking.

1:20:09.200 --> 1:20:10.760
This takes me back.

1:20:11.840 --> 1:20:14.600
About three centuries, in fact.

1:20:16.560 --> 1:20:17.640
We must do it again.

1:20:18.320 --> 1:20:20.200
I think probably not.

1:20:22.440 --> 1:20:23.680
I quite agree.

1:20:38.920 --> 1:20:39.840
How you feeling?

1:20:40.840 --> 1:20:42.120
Particularly mortal.

1:20:43.640 --> 1:20:46.280
-How about you?
-Indestructible.

1:20:47.960 --> 1:20:49.120
How did you do it?

1:20:49.640 --> 1:20:50.800
Uh...

1:20:51.320 --> 1:20:55.240
I swam under the boat
and climbed up the other side.

1:20:56.040 --> 1:20:58.800
As escapes go, basic but effective.

1:21:00.120 --> 1:21:01.520
I really thought we'd won.

1:21:01.600 --> 1:21:03.880
If it's any comfort, Agatha,

1:21:04.880 --> 1:21:06.800
you came closer than anyone.

1:21:23.720 --> 1:21:24.920
Oh, look.

1:21:28.560 --> 1:21:32.000
The pawn almost made it
to the other side of the board.

1:21:32.480 --> 1:21:34.920
But I'm afraid
there'll be no second queen.

1:21:35.960 --> 1:21:37.360
Piotr and Olgaren got away.

1:21:38.160 --> 1:21:39.560
Well, you can't eat them all.

1:21:39.640 --> 1:21:42.280
I missed out on Dr. Sharma too,
and that's a pity.

1:21:42.840 --> 1:21:44.320
I love science.

1:21:44.400 --> 1:21:47.200
Science is the future, Agatha.

1:21:47.280 --> 1:21:48.960
And yet, you still fear the cross?

1:21:49.600 --> 1:21:50.480
'Course I do.

1:21:51.600 --> 1:21:53.480
Everyone does, that's the problem.

1:21:53.560 --> 1:21:56.320
It's not a symbol of virtue and kindness.

1:21:56.400 --> 1:21:59.200
It's a mark of horror and oppression.

1:21:59.280 --> 1:22:03.840
Your idiot Church has terrorized
the peasant population for centuries,

1:22:03.920 --> 1:22:08.000
and I have been imbibing the blood
of those same persons for so long,

1:22:08.080 --> 1:22:10.920
I have absorbed their fear of the cross.

1:22:11.360 --> 1:22:12.880
My God.

1:22:13.720 --> 1:22:16.800
I can't wait to eat some atheists.

1:22:17.920 --> 1:22:18.800
No.

1:22:19.640 --> 1:22:20.480
Sorry?

1:22:21.160 --> 1:22:25.200
No, I mean, that's all very nice
and logical, but that's not the reason.

1:22:25.760 --> 1:22:26.880
What makes you so sure?

1:22:26.960 --> 1:22:30.120
Because I think, Count Dracula,
I'm coming to know you.

1:22:30.880 --> 1:22:31.960
I know when you are lying.

1:22:34.520 --> 1:22:37.280
Why would I bother lying to you?

1:22:37.360 --> 1:22:40.360
You wouldn't.
It's not me to whom you're lying.

1:22:44.320 --> 1:22:45.920
Why are you making conversation?

1:22:46.760 --> 1:22:48.480
-People do.
-You don't.

1:22:48.800 --> 1:22:50.680
Well, it's never too late to change.

1:22:51.320 --> 1:22:53.440
You're trying to draw me into an argument.

1:22:55.160 --> 1:22:56.680
Are you trying to distract me?

1:22:57.520 --> 1:22:59.360
What is it you always say?

1:22:59.440 --> 1:23:03.360
Oh, yes, one must never rush a nun.

1:23:11.240 --> 1:23:13.080
Go ahead. I win.

1:23:13.600 --> 1:23:17.680
The last thing your eyes will ever see
is the contempt in mine.

1:24:01.920 --> 1:24:02.960
They're dead, then?

1:24:05.040 --> 1:24:05.920
Yes.

1:24:08.440 --> 1:24:09.280
What now?

1:24:10.560 --> 1:24:11.400
We honor them.

1:24:13.120 --> 1:24:13.960
How?

1:24:16.040 --> 1:24:17.600
By telling their story.

1:24:21.360 --> 1:24:22.280
So...

1:24:24.080 --> 1:24:26.800
what did you think of your first time
at sea, Piotr?

1:24:29.400 --> 1:24:30.240
Marius.

1:24:32.200 --> 1:24:33.040
Marius?

1:24:33.640 --> 1:24:34.640
That's my real name.

1:24:37.120 --> 1:24:38.400
That's what my friends call me.

1:26:19.280 --> 1:26:21.720
Welcome to England, Count Dracula.

1:26:23.680 --> 1:26:25.080
What kept you?
