WEBVTT

00:03.371 --> 00:05.515
Wow.

00:05.539 --> 00:07.017
Really something, isn't it?

00:07.041 --> 00:09.519
It's absolutely... horrible.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.788
It's not, though.

00:11.812 --> 00:13.323
Fire's a miracle.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.325
Naturally clears the forest,

00:15.349 --> 00:17.894
recycles nutrients into the soil

00:17.918 --> 00:19.696
- and stimulates new plant growth.
- Ugh.

00:19.720 --> 00:22.599
That is a load of hippie,
tree-hugging nonsense.

00:22.623 --> 00:25.402
How'd you become a forest ranger
if you don't love the outdoors?

00:25.426 --> 00:27.404
Because I hate the indoors.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.606
Hey... I got nothing
against nature,

00:29.630 --> 00:31.742
but it can be argued

00:31.766 --> 00:33.777
that it was a good thing
a meteor hit the Earth

00:33.801 --> 00:35.412
and wiped out all the dinosaurs,
so they weren't here

00:35.436 --> 00:36.847
to eat us when we came along.

00:36.871 --> 00:39.182
But I think we'd all agree
it'd be a bad thing,

00:39.206 --> 00:42.586
however natural,
if a meteor were to hit us now.

00:42.610 --> 00:43.987
Jake?

00:44.011 --> 00:45.501
What the hell?

00:46.947 --> 00:48.825
Oh, my God. He's all burned up.

00:48.849 --> 00:50.660
Oh, he must have gotten caught
in the blaze.

00:50.684 --> 00:52.151
What was he doing up here?

00:53.521 --> 00:54.522
Don't touch him!

00:57.792 --> 00:59.302
He's only burned on one side.

00:59.326 --> 01:01.191
How could that possibly happen?

01:02.163 --> 01:04.256
Miracle of fire?

01:37.731 --> 01:39.643
There is nothing good
on the Internet anymore.

01:39.667 --> 01:41.078
Yeah, I think
that Internet thing

01:41.102 --> 01:42.913
has just about run its course.

01:42.937 --> 01:44.581
Pop-up ads,
banner ads, video ads...

01:44.605 --> 01:46.483
I think this whole page
may be an ad.

01:46.507 --> 01:47.884
Ad for what?

01:47.908 --> 01:49.052
Hair loss pills?

01:49.076 --> 01:51.154
This is a pill

01:51.178 --> 01:52.823
that makes people
lose their hair?

01:52.847 --> 01:54.324
It's for growing hair.

01:54.348 --> 01:55.492
Why would I need more hair?

01:55.516 --> 01:57.527
Not you; Men.

01:57.551 --> 01:58.995
Like I need more men?

01:59.019 --> 02:01.765
Men need more hair.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.767
Women need less.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.402
Must be an industry
if you put those together.

02:05.426 --> 02:08.338
Take the hair from the women,
put it on the men.

02:08.362 --> 02:11.608
This is a prescription
eyelash wand.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.443
Yeah, Ziva, I think
your morning Internet routine

02:13.467 --> 02:14.678
needs a little bit of tweaking.

02:14.702 --> 02:16.513
That is that thing. That thing

02:16.537 --> 02:18.081
where people tell
complete strangers

02:18.105 --> 02:19.549
whether they started their day

02:19.573 --> 02:21.518
putting on both socks and then

02:21.542 --> 02:24.354
both shoes or one sock
and one shoe

02:24.378 --> 02:25.922
or the other sock
or the other shoe.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.524
Tweaking, not tweeting.

02:27.548 --> 02:29.893
Tweeting.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.328
There's one on there
that's really good.

02:31.352 --> 02:32.529
Guy's talking about everything

02:32.553 --> 02:33.630
his roommate's doing

02:33.654 --> 02:34.865
and the roommate
doesn't know about it.

02:34.889 --> 02:35.866
It's highly entertaining.

02:35.890 --> 02:37.067
I'll send you the link.

02:37.091 --> 02:38.401
Ooh, I got a link for you.

02:38.425 --> 02:40.770
No more links.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.072
I have spent my entire morning

02:42.096 --> 02:43.273
sifting through
all of this nonsense,

02:43.297 --> 02:44.307
looking for something

02:44.331 --> 02:45.742
that matters. How hard is it

02:45.766 --> 02:47.711
for someone to tell me
the news and bring it to me?

02:47.735 --> 02:49.336
There must be a better way.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.122
What?

02:59.146 --> 03:02.492
Hey, boss, I got an article here
that you may want to read.

03:02.516 --> 03:05.095
I can send the link
to your e-mail

03:05.119 --> 03:06.359
or text the link to your phone.

03:07.454 --> 03:09.266
Or I can just print it out
on paper

03:09.290 --> 03:10.901
and give it to you in your hand.

03:10.925 --> 03:13.003
It's a revolutionary concept,
McGee.

03:13.027 --> 03:14.271
Where we going, boss?

03:14.295 --> 03:15.839
West Virginia, Appalachians.

03:15.863 --> 03:16.907
Got a dead Navy pilot.

03:16.931 --> 03:18.592
Pack your hiking boots.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.144
Breathtaking.

03:21.168 --> 03:22.612
Yeah, it was
for Lieutenant Commander

03:22.636 --> 03:24.614
Brad "Hondo" Sayers, U.S. Navy.

03:24.638 --> 03:26.249
Granted extended leave

03:26.273 --> 03:29.186
from Pax a week ago.

03:29.210 --> 03:31.555
- Fighter jock.
- He's a test pilot.

03:31.579 --> 03:33.790
Can't believe
I'm getting a signal out here.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.559
Rangers flipped him over
to identify him.

03:35.583 --> 03:36.927
Who's going to identify
the rangers

03:36.951 --> 03:38.261
when Ducky gets
through with them?

03:38.285 --> 03:40.397
You're not supposed
to touch the body.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.098
What do you think, McGee?

03:42.122 --> 03:44.034
This guy eject
out of a plane or what?

03:44.058 --> 03:46.102
Carbon fiber helmet's
designed for skydiving,

03:46.126 --> 03:48.138
but the suit is flame-retardant.

03:48.162 --> 03:49.973
Well, it only did half the job.

03:49.997 --> 03:51.908
Other half of him's crispy.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.310
McDLT.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.078
I don't get that one.

03:55.102 --> 03:56.146
That's not a McNickname.

03:56.170 --> 03:58.381
The McDonald's McDLT.

03:58.405 --> 04:00.483
Hot side hot, cold side cold.

04:00.507 --> 04:01.785
That's very tasteful.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.220
Forest rangers say this area

04:03.244 --> 04:05.989
has been off-limits to hikers
since it burned a month ago.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.224
Winter fire season.

04:07.248 --> 04:08.658
Now, forest fire
didn't kill him.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.193
Some fire did.

04:10.217 --> 04:14.030
A high-temperature explosion
blew his arm right off.

04:14.054 --> 04:16.055
Ah, animals could
have pulled that off.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.512
You are awfully
close to that body, Timothy.

04:29.536 --> 04:32.215
I'm just trying to get
a look at what's on his back.

04:32.239 --> 04:36.253
Look with your eyes, McGee,
not your hands.

04:36.277 --> 04:38.555
You have a long ride
coming up here, Palmer?

04:38.579 --> 04:39.923
He wouldn't let me drive.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.324
I begged and begged.

04:41.348 --> 04:44.027
What is it
that makes you so anxious?

04:44.051 --> 04:45.262
Flight suit.

04:45.286 --> 04:47.163
Helmet. Dead man's a pilot.

04:47.187 --> 04:48.531
And this doesn't look like
a parachute on his back.

04:48.555 --> 04:50.533
You think he fell
from the sky, McGee,

04:50.557 --> 04:51.935
without a parachute?

04:51.959 --> 04:54.804
Well, there should be a lot more
metal pieces around here.

04:54.828 --> 04:56.386
Okay. Look around.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.179
Got an arm over here.

05:03.203 --> 05:04.781
Well, the flesh kind
or the metal kind?

05:04.805 --> 05:06.136
Metal.

05:09.143 --> 05:10.633
Got a nozzle.

05:14.248 --> 05:15.925
I got another body.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.127
Oh, don't move it.

05:17.151 --> 05:19.244
Here I come.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.627
Bag it up, Palmer.

05:31.165 --> 05:32.792
Mother lode.

05:37.438 --> 05:38.648
Fuel tank?

05:38.672 --> 05:40.606
Yes, that is a fuel tank.

05:43.610 --> 05:46.323
Interesting reading, Jethro?

05:46.347 --> 05:47.891
Yeah.

05:47.915 --> 05:50.493
McGee seems to have an instinct
for this one.

05:50.517 --> 05:53.396
Perhaps baby bird is ready
to leave the nest.

05:53.420 --> 05:56.132
Well, boss, we're a few fingers
short of a hand,

05:56.156 --> 05:57.567
but we got some good stuff here.

05:57.591 --> 06:00.570
Guy pulled a Scarecrow.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.472
Pieces of him everywhere.
Here you go, Ducky.

06:02.496 --> 06:03.807
Hey, look at you, Palmer...

06:03.831 --> 06:05.742
you bagged yourself
a flying monkey.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.344
It's a squirrel.

06:07.368 --> 06:10.680
Fuel tank, control arm,
joystick.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.649
So, McGee, do you know

06:12.673 --> 06:14.584
what killed Lieutenant
Commander Sayers?

06:14.608 --> 06:15.985
Yeah, I think I do.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.687
You think?

06:17.711 --> 06:19.144
Or you know?

06:21.048 --> 06:22.992
I know one thing.

06:23.016 --> 06:25.177
His jet pack exploded.

06:27.121 --> 06:29.032
Jet packs.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.433
Yeah.

06:30.457 --> 06:32.084
It's going to be a weird one.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.949
Lieutenant Commander
Brad Sayers.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.517
Naval Academy grad,

06:47.541 --> 06:49.119
primary aviation training
at Pensacola.

06:49.143 --> 06:50.787
Advanced at Lemoore,

06:50.811 --> 06:52.389
top gun at Fallon.

06:52.413 --> 06:53.723
Unmarried, no kids.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.258
Call sign "Hondo."

06:55.282 --> 06:56.926
Á la John Wayne.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.928
I thought he was "The Duke."

06:58.952 --> 07:00.563
He is. He was.

07:00.587 --> 07:01.631
He always will be.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.233
Sayers was part of a squadron

07:03.257 --> 07:06.269
of test pilots
at Patuxent River Air Base.

07:06.293 --> 07:07.570
The first to fly
experimental planes.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.839
Military experiments
with jet packs?

07:09.863 --> 07:11.875
No.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.576
I wouldn't... well, yeah.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.602
They did, but...

07:19.406 --> 07:22.385
After years of testing
various designs,

07:22.409 --> 07:25.088
ultimately, they decided
helicopters were more practical

07:25.112 --> 07:27.090
for Earth-atmosphere flight.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.359
Although NASA's compressed
gas-powered Manned Maneuvering.

07:29.383 --> 07:33.062
Unit evolved from Bell Systems'
rocket belt technology.

07:33.086 --> 07:36.065
"Rocket belt" being
the original terminology,

07:36.089 --> 07:38.601
rather than the more
colloquial "jet pack."

07:38.625 --> 07:40.937
McGee's very passionate
about the subject.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.406
We spend a lot of time here,
just the three of us.

07:43.430 --> 07:45.108
I was telling him
about the bonus features

07:45.132 --> 07:47.277
on the Thunderball DVD,
which were pretty interesting,

07:47.301 --> 07:51.181
and he says, "Um, Tony,
bonus features aren't science,"

07:51.205 --> 07:53.216
and so he...

07:53.240 --> 07:54.384
He schooled you.

07:54.408 --> 07:55.552
Yep.

07:55.576 --> 07:56.886
Where is he now?

07:56.910 --> 07:58.788
He's, uh, down with Abby.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.457
We cannot tear him away
from the evidence.

08:00.481 --> 08:02.892
Hmm. Well, I'll see
you both there

08:02.916 --> 08:04.577
when you get back
from Pax River.

08:05.886 --> 08:08.965
The August 1928 issue
of Amazing Stories

08:08.989 --> 08:11.167
first stirred
the national imagination.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.269
Featured the Skylark of Space
on the cover.

08:13.293 --> 08:15.271
And then, you got Buck Rogers.

08:15.295 --> 08:16.973
What's really amazing

08:16.997 --> 08:19.642
is how much more fascinating
jet pack trivia gets

08:19.666 --> 08:21.644
the 11th time you've hear it.

08:21.668 --> 08:24.647
Did you know that the original
rocket belt was propelled

08:24.671 --> 08:27.650
by a chemical reaction
and not traditional jet fuel?

08:27.674 --> 08:29.141
I know.

08:30.344 --> 08:32.455
You showed me
your PowerPoint presentation,

08:32.479 --> 08:33.789
like, five years ago.

08:33.813 --> 08:35.491
But I've updated it.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.485
To include recent breakthroughs
in single-man flight.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.065
Good.

08:42.089 --> 08:44.067
Yeah, the Swiss pilot
and engineer, Yves Rossy,

08:44.091 --> 08:45.468
and his four-engine glider.

08:45.492 --> 08:46.970
And the Kiwis.

08:46.994 --> 08:48.738
See, everyone thinks that
they are going to be the ones

08:48.762 --> 08:51.841
to crack the commercially viable
prototype with the Martin.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.765
Ooh.

08:56.803 --> 08:59.182
What do you got?

08:59.206 --> 09:01.017
It's residue
from the flame suit.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.986
Hydrogen peroxide...

09:03.010 --> 09:04.087
That makes sense.

09:04.111 --> 09:05.989
And kerosene.

09:06.013 --> 09:09.025
Kerosene?

09:09.049 --> 09:11.861
Strange to use those two
in a combination.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.129
Doesn't sound like

09:13.153 --> 09:14.197
any prototype I've studied.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.222
Maybe they got...

09:17.024 --> 09:19.068
What do you got now?

09:19.092 --> 09:21.104
McGee...

09:21.128 --> 09:22.505
that's the elevator.

09:22.529 --> 09:24.121
McGee.

09:29.636 --> 09:31.614
I thought you'd want
to see that.

09:31.638 --> 09:32.949
Can't believe
the Mexican authorities

09:32.973 --> 09:36.352
dropped the charges
against Colonel Bell.

09:36.376 --> 09:37.687
Colonel Bell.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.522
Wonder if there's any
relationship to Bell Labs.

09:39.546 --> 09:42.692
Bell Labs... inventors
of the rocket belt.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.694
Rocket belt's an amazing model.

09:44.718 --> 09:47.864
It's a catalyst that decomposes
hydrogen peroxide

09:47.888 --> 09:49.866
into pressurized steam
and oxygen.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.367
You get significant thrust
from lightweight rockets

09:51.391 --> 09:53.036
for about 30 seconds...

09:53.060 --> 09:54.404
I got it, McGee.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.639
You know a lot about jet packs.

09:56.663 --> 09:59.642
Boss, when I was a kid
stationed in Alameda,

09:59.666 --> 10:01.811
my parents took me
to the opening ceremonies

10:01.835 --> 10:03.846
of the '84 Olympics
in Los Angeles.

10:03.870 --> 10:04.881
Right.

10:04.905 --> 10:06.382
And that guy flew
over the crowd.

10:06.406 --> 10:07.984
Bill Suitor.

10:08.008 --> 10:10.653
Flew right over my head,
I swear.

10:10.677 --> 10:12.655
All right.

10:12.679 --> 10:14.657
I believe you.

10:14.681 --> 10:17.206
You got the lead on this one.

10:25.058 --> 10:27.403
I knew it. I just knew it.

10:27.427 --> 10:28.905
I mean, Hondo
would never go a week

10:28.929 --> 10:30.039
without getting up in the air.

10:30.063 --> 10:32.275
Off base,
against Navy regulations.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.310
Your men are subject
to the same restrictions

10:34.334 --> 10:35.636
as the average pilot?

10:37.170 --> 10:39.882
I don't know exactly what an
average pilot is, Agent David.

10:39.906 --> 10:41.851
None of them are naval aviators.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.987
These boys... they operate
under extreme stress.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.855
Some of them find relief
in taking jobs

10:45.879 --> 10:47.023
outside of the squadron.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.191
We allow that.

10:48.215 --> 10:49.525
As long as it doesn't interfere

10:49.549 --> 10:50.727
with combat readiness.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.529
Hondo...
man, he was a rare breed.

10:53.553 --> 10:54.931
Drink six or seven cups
of coffee,

10:54.955 --> 10:56.733
and he'd strap himself
to anything that goes fast.

10:56.757 --> 10:57.934
Who was he closest to?

10:57.958 --> 11:00.470
Commander Peter Sheridan.

11:00.494 --> 11:01.604
Hey, Banshee!

11:01.628 --> 11:02.705
Sir.

11:02.729 --> 11:04.207
I'll catch up with you guys.

11:04.231 --> 11:05.789
Yes, sir?

11:07.768 --> 11:09.746
Banshee, we got some bad news.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.147
Hondo?

11:11.171 --> 11:13.149
Yes. Sorry, Commander.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.437
He died in some sort
of explosion or crash.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.288
What did he crash?

11:19.312 --> 11:20.957
You assume he was at the stick?

11:20.981 --> 11:23.793
Hondo never takes a backseat
to anyone.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.428
Control freak.

11:25.452 --> 11:27.463
I think it'd be more accurate
to say he was careful.

11:27.487 --> 11:29.132
He's got to be.

11:29.156 --> 11:31.134
With these machines
and their power and speed,

11:31.158 --> 11:33.136
slight movements
have major consequences.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.505
We try not to think
about it too hard,

11:35.529 --> 11:37.273
but it happens.
So, what did he crash?

11:37.297 --> 11:39.390
Believe it was some sort
of jet pack.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.847
Crap.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.082
Victor Tillman.

11:46.106 --> 11:47.250
That's who you want to talk to.

11:47.274 --> 11:48.418
Came to me first.

11:48.442 --> 11:50.119
Aerospace engineer.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.821
Company's called Tillman Air.

11:51.845 --> 11:54.257
Banshee went up the ladder
for a waiver, Navy rejected it.

11:54.281 --> 11:56.092
Didn't want to support
his research.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.428
Tillman must have gone
to Hondo next

11:58.452 --> 12:00.697
and convinced him it was worth
ignoring regulations

12:00.721 --> 12:03.087
in order for a chance
to fly something like that.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.121
Thank you.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.186
Hey.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.256
Was there anything left of him?

12:15.936 --> 12:18.114
If you're sure
I'm ready, Doctor.

12:18.138 --> 12:21.951
Mr. Palmer, the time has come
for you to fly solo.

12:21.975 --> 12:24.944
The body is all yours.

12:27.681 --> 12:30.927
Dr. Mallard, I am suddenly
overcome with the desire

12:30.951 --> 12:34.030
to share a story of only
a peripherally relevant nature.

12:34.054 --> 12:36.132
It's a hazard of the profession,
Mr. Palmer.

12:36.156 --> 12:37.400
So, you'd advise I refrain

12:37.424 --> 12:39.669
under the "got to learn to walk
before you run" column?

12:39.693 --> 12:42.338
Not at all, as long as it
doesn't impede your focus.

12:42.362 --> 12:45.208
Think of it
as spreading your wings.

12:45.232 --> 12:48.244
Though bear in mind
the fate of young Icarus,

12:48.268 --> 12:50.613
who disregarded the warnings
of his father, Daedalus,

12:50.637 --> 12:52.348
and flew too high.

12:52.372 --> 12:53.850
And the wax that held
his feathers on

12:53.874 --> 12:55.017
was melted by the sun.

12:55.041 --> 12:56.919
And he fell to his death.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.588
Fall was the cause of death?

12:58.612 --> 13:00.523
Ah, Jethro, for once,
you have failed

13:00.547 --> 13:02.525
to pick up the threads
of our conversation.

13:02.549 --> 13:06.129
I was not speaking of,
uh, dear departed.

13:06.153 --> 13:07.964
Lieutenant Commander Sayers.

13:07.988 --> 13:10.399
Fall wasn't the cause of death?

13:10.423 --> 13:12.101
Yet to be determined.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.536
What were you guys
just talking about?

13:13.560 --> 13:16.472
Mr. Palmer was about
to regale me with a tale

13:16.496 --> 13:18.908
that is only
tangentially connected

13:18.932 --> 13:20.695
to his first solo autopsy.

13:21.735 --> 13:23.032
Of a squirrel.

13:24.738 --> 13:26.482
Um...

13:26.506 --> 13:29.409
Work through your fear,
Mr. Palmer.

13:30.777 --> 13:35.391
This, uh... this-this reminds me
of my junior year abroad.

13:35.415 --> 13:37.260
I was staying with a family
outside of Lyon

13:37.284 --> 13:39.495
who spoke only French,

13:39.519 --> 13:42.532
and my French was okay at best.

13:42.556 --> 13:45.001
And whatever you might think
of the people of France,

13:45.025 --> 13:46.903
the squirrels
are extraordinarily friendly.

13:46.927 --> 13:49.138
So, I had to explain to them

13:49.162 --> 13:50.740
my fear of squirrels.
You see, in DC,

13:50.764 --> 13:53.176
there are brown squirrels,
and there are black squirrels,

13:53.200 --> 13:55.945
and at the time,
black squirrels carried rabies.

13:55.969 --> 13:57.780
So, my mother used to bait traps

13:57.804 --> 13:59.882
with peanut butter,
capture the squirrels

13:59.906 --> 14:02.118
and release them
on the other side of the river

14:02.142 --> 14:04.007
so they wouldn't bite
any of the kids.

14:07.614 --> 14:10.593
But I confused the words,

14:10.617 --> 14:12.461
uh, écureuil,
which means squirrel,

14:12.485 --> 14:17.366
with the much less accurate, uh,
requin, which means, uh, shark.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.802
How they must have pictured
your strange homeland

14:19.826 --> 14:21.228
with your shark-hunting mother.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.010
What's the point
of the squirrel?

14:28.034 --> 14:30.746
Oh, um, uh,
we believe his cause of death

14:30.770 --> 14:32.481
may be related to Sayers.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.851
In desperate situations,

14:34.875 --> 14:36.419
when the food supplies
are scarce,

14:36.443 --> 14:38.087
squirrels will eat
almost anything,

14:38.111 --> 14:39.789
including human flesh.

14:39.813 --> 14:41.924
Fire eliminated
all the other options.

14:41.948 --> 14:44.060
Yeah, and we have to inventory
Rocket J's stomach

14:44.084 --> 14:46.462
to confirm its contents,

14:46.486 --> 14:49.565
but initial dental impressions

14:49.589 --> 14:53.669
suggest that his last meal
was Sayers' soft tissues.

14:53.693 --> 14:55.404
Yes, hypovolemic shock.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.640
Massive internal bleeding.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.575
This squirrel
was likely poisoned.

14:59.599 --> 15:01.711
Secondary poisoning.

15:01.735 --> 15:04.814
This squirrel died from eating
Sayers' toxic organs.

15:04.838 --> 15:06.816
Sayers was poisoned?

15:06.840 --> 15:09.018
Then we can't yet say
if it contributed

15:09.042 --> 15:10.720
to his fall to Earth, but...

15:10.744 --> 15:13.178
Somebody was trying to kill him.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.065
Since the dawn of time,

15:23.089 --> 15:24.767
man has dreamed of flight.

15:24.791 --> 15:28.170
Is it gravity or nature,
or merely the limitations

15:28.194 --> 15:31.173
of our imagination
that has kept us grounded?

15:31.197 --> 15:33.676
This is a public demonstration
in 1961.

15:33.700 --> 15:38.080
Functional technology
nearly half a century ago.

15:38.104 --> 15:41.117
Measure that against progress
in other arenas.

15:41.141 --> 15:45.254
Internal combustion engine,
radio, television, the Internet.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.390
In 50 years,
they go from impossible

15:47.414 --> 15:49.091
to practical, to ubiquitous.

15:49.115 --> 15:52.561
Meanwhile, they keep the
jet pack relegated to the world

15:52.585 --> 15:55.231
of science fiction.

15:55.255 --> 15:56.565
They?

15:56.589 --> 15:58.768
The jet pack conspiracy?

15:58.792 --> 16:00.636
Well, boss, if you look at it,

16:00.660 --> 16:03.139
- it's really the only logical explanation.
- Hey.

16:03.163 --> 16:04.941
The primary obstacles

16:04.965 --> 16:06.642
to a commercially viable model

16:06.666 --> 16:10.613
are weight, flight time,
distance and simple controls.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.415
Did we miss the part about
the motorcycle parking spaces?

16:12.439 --> 16:16.385
Imagine a jet pack landing and
refueling area at your office.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.788
Apparently not.

16:18.812 --> 16:21.457
The average daily commute
is 16 miles one-way,

16:21.481 --> 16:24.493
but the variance
in travel time is huge

16:24.517 --> 16:26.228
because of roadway congestion.

16:26.252 --> 16:28.164
- Slow drivers.
- Bad drivers.

16:28.188 --> 16:30.232
What is so hard?
You go as fast as possible.

16:30.256 --> 16:31.934
When something gets
in your way, you turn.

16:31.958 --> 16:33.436
You're quoting Better Off Dead.

16:33.460 --> 16:34.670
I told you to watch that.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.238
30-mile radius.

16:36.262 --> 16:38.240
Simple enough
that you don't need to be

16:38.264 --> 16:40.176
a helicopter pilot to fly it.

16:40.200 --> 16:43.226
Patent that, and we are all
living like the Jetsons.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.016
Or dying like burnt-out
bottle rockets.

16:47.040 --> 16:51.187
There is a thin margin
for error, yes.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.522
Sayers had rat poison
in his system.

16:53.546 --> 16:54.957
- Abby confirmed it.
- He was impaired

16:54.981 --> 16:56.025
while he was flying.

16:56.049 --> 16:57.526
In Commander Cody's
brave new world,

16:57.550 --> 17:00.930
FUIs.

17:00.954 --> 17:03.532
So, the crash did not kill him?

17:03.556 --> 17:04.733
Well, it didn't help.

17:04.758 --> 17:05.935
What'd you guys find?

17:05.959 --> 17:07.636
Uh, Sayers was test flying
on the side

17:07.660 --> 17:09.704
for a Victor Tillman.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.007
Tillman Air.

17:11.031 --> 17:13.242
He put out a press release
a couple months ago

17:13.266 --> 17:15.211
saying they were getting close
to unveiling.

17:15.234 --> 17:16.746
Sayers' death in one
of those jet packs

17:16.770 --> 17:18.614
would not be good for business.

17:18.637 --> 17:19.798
Smacks of a cover-up.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.721
All right.

17:25.744 --> 17:27.790
Going to need to get a look
at Tillman's financials.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.025
I'm going to stay here.

17:29.049 --> 17:31.293
You two go out and talk to him.

17:31.317 --> 17:33.262
So, McGee's not coming?

17:33.286 --> 17:34.617
To the jet pack factory?

17:36.089 --> 17:37.366
Okay.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.035
Well, you get
your homework done, and...

17:39.059 --> 17:41.370
and then you can go out and
play with the neighbor kids.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.294
Good boy.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.525
The price of being in charge.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.750
It's got to be a punishment.

17:54.774 --> 17:57.720
Some kind
of motivational technique.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.221
McGee staying behind?

17:59.245 --> 18:01.110
It's like... I don't get it.

18:02.449 --> 18:03.592
It's like the carrot.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.418
You know, the carrot
in front of the horse?

18:08.555 --> 18:11.167
Israeli drivers ed
must really be something.

18:11.191 --> 18:12.368
He's still there.

18:12.392 --> 18:13.736
Who is?

18:13.760 --> 18:14.920
I got a tail.

18:15.962 --> 18:17.873
Wow. Hmm.

18:17.897 --> 18:19.642
I can't believe he bit it.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.043
But... But I can.

18:21.067 --> 18:22.545
You know what I mean?
I mean, it's like those guys

18:22.569 --> 18:24.880
who raise bears and then you
find out they get eaten by one

18:24.904 --> 18:26.215
and you say,
"Oh, yes, of course."

18:26.239 --> 18:28.784
But, uh, Hondo...
oh, fireball is exactly

18:28.808 --> 18:30.186
how he would have wanted it.

18:30.210 --> 18:34.423
Oh, man, I... you know,
it just doesn't make any sense.

18:34.447 --> 18:35.424
Why is that?

18:35.448 --> 18:37.026
You said you found a pack.

18:37.050 --> 18:39.261
Where did he get the pack?

18:39.285 --> 18:41.864
Well, yeah, that's why
we're here, Vic.

18:41.888 --> 18:44.433
Right, right, right.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.768
Uh, we're going this way.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.060
She's fine.

18:49.062 --> 18:51.831
This is a secure area.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.479
The card's in my pocket.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.914
I'm not touching you.

18:58.938 --> 19:01.083
Yeah.

19:01.107 --> 19:02.870
I got it.

19:06.079 --> 19:07.756
After you.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.805
Thank you.

19:20.326 --> 19:21.953
Smile!

19:26.799 --> 19:29.912
Safety is my primary concern.

19:29.936 --> 19:33.716
I try to stay away from the
more combustible fuel sources.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.751
Makes it a challenge
to manufacture sufficient

19:35.775 --> 19:38.154
vertical thrust
while keeping it compact.

19:38.178 --> 19:39.955
Yeah, how's that coming?

19:39.979 --> 19:41.390
We've maintained level flight

19:41.414 --> 19:43.292
at an altitude
of seven to ten meters

19:43.316 --> 19:45.528
for up to nine minutes.

19:45.552 --> 19:46.862
As you can see,

19:46.886 --> 19:49.665
the controls
are extremely sophisticated.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.400
These are my babies.

19:51.424 --> 19:55.538
Bravo, Juliet... and Oscar.

19:55.562 --> 19:58.407
Huh. My bologna
has a first name.

19:58.431 --> 20:01.243
Sounds like you're
missing some letters.

20:01.267 --> 20:04.079
Not every model makes it
to the final testing phase.

20:04.103 --> 20:06.182
Some of them never
even get off the ground.

20:06.206 --> 20:11.200
Well, seeing a few similarities
to our model here, Vic.

20:13.546 --> 20:16.392
Each piece is extensively
logged, branded,

20:16.416 --> 20:18.694
patented and kept
under lock and key.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.197
Believe me, no one
is taking anything from me.

20:21.221 --> 20:23.065
- Again.
- Excuse me?

20:23.089 --> 20:24.500
Sounded like you
cut yourself off

20:24.524 --> 20:26.235
before you could say "again."

20:26.259 --> 20:28.454
So, who stole from you, Vic?

20:32.165 --> 20:33.842
This is your area
of expertise, McGee.

20:33.866 --> 20:36.011
I am down here
trying to put together

20:36.035 --> 20:37.880
a jet pack jigsaw puzzle,
and I don't even know

20:37.904 --> 20:39.748
- what it's supposed to look like.
- Abbs, you know

20:39.772 --> 20:42.542
that's what I'd rather be doing,
but I got to go right now.

20:44.410 --> 20:47.423
What, McGee,
Tillman's financials

20:47.447 --> 20:49.425
- not thrilling you?
- Not at all, boss.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.727
As an individual, the guy's got

20:51.751 --> 20:53.829
$47 to his name,

20:53.853 --> 20:56.332
but he has corporations
inside of corporations,

20:56.356 --> 20:59.587
hiding cash since his divorce
from Vanessa Tillman.

21:00.627 --> 21:01.958
That the ex-wife?

21:02.929 --> 21:05.174
And former chief
financial officer.

21:05.198 --> 21:07.109
They split, he fires her,
turns into

21:07.133 --> 21:09.411
a messy fight
over everything from the house

21:09.435 --> 21:11.046
to the company's
proprietary technology.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.414
Where's his money?

21:12.438 --> 21:14.283
I cross-referenced payments
from his corporate account

21:14.307 --> 21:16.919
against the time
Sayers wasn't at Pax.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.420
Tillman was paying Sayers

21:18.444 --> 21:19.521
five figures a pop.

21:19.545 --> 21:21.390
Yeah, he was up
to his elbows in it.

21:21.414 --> 21:22.658
And he wasn't the only one.

21:22.682 --> 21:24.059
Sayers wasn't
just collecting checks

21:24.083 --> 21:25.661
from Uncle Sam
and Victor Tillman.

21:25.685 --> 21:29.698
For some reason, Vanessa Tillman
had him on the payroll as well.

21:29.722 --> 21:31.100
Hey!

21:31.124 --> 21:32.352
Come on!

21:36.729 --> 21:38.941
I don't know what you
think happened here.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.943
Talk to him.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.678
We think your test pilot
is dead,

21:42.702 --> 21:45.034
and we think that you
had motive to kill him.

21:46.639 --> 21:47.983
I liked Sayers.

21:48.007 --> 21:49.251
He was a great guy.

21:49.275 --> 21:51.320
What motive would I
have had to kill him?

21:51.344 --> 21:52.755
It wasn't even my pack.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.576
He was being paid
by your ex-wife.

21:56.249 --> 21:58.427
That son of a bitch.

21:58.451 --> 22:00.562
So, you didn't know?

22:00.586 --> 22:02.264
No, I didn't know.

22:02.288 --> 22:03.699
Of course, I didn't know.

22:03.723 --> 22:05.190
If I had known, I would have...

22:09.195 --> 22:10.739
I would have fired him.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.474
She was my top competitor.

22:12.498 --> 22:15.444
- Locally.
- Well, yeah. The Kiwis got a big jump on me.

22:15.468 --> 22:16.478
And the Swiss.

22:16.502 --> 22:18.113
Oh, come on. A collapsible wing?

22:18.137 --> 22:19.415
It's great for distance...

22:19.439 --> 22:20.916
But without hover capability,

22:20.940 --> 22:23.242
it'll always be
for professionals, I know.

22:28.514 --> 22:30.225
This is a patent

22:30.249 --> 22:32.161
for a mixed-fuel
propulsion system.

22:32.185 --> 22:34.496
It's a hybrid
of H2O2 and kerosene.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.999
Lab tests show
that mixture was found

22:37.023 --> 22:38.567
on Sayers' body.

22:38.591 --> 22:40.102
Has your name on it.

22:40.126 --> 22:41.437
Is it yours?

22:41.461 --> 22:43.759
Yes.

22:45.598 --> 22:47.225
No.

22:48.634 --> 22:50.336
Can't have it both ways.

22:52.839 --> 22:54.932
Vanessa got it in the divorce.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.656
Nice candid.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.157
You got a plate?

23:02.181 --> 23:03.459
Of course.

23:03.483 --> 23:06.362
Lanny Carothers.

23:06.386 --> 23:09.098
Hmm, a Maryland P.I. license.

23:09.122 --> 23:11.200
Somebody hired a private
investigator to follow us.

23:11.224 --> 23:13.202
Maybe it is not us.
Maybe it's you.

23:13.226 --> 23:14.603
Maybe it is you.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.605
Hello.

23:16.629 --> 23:19.074
I believe
you're holding my client.

23:19.098 --> 23:22.378
Oh, I'd be happy
to hold anything you need.

23:22.402 --> 23:24.947
Charming, Mr. DiNozzo.

23:24.971 --> 23:27.439
Please take me
to see Victor Tillman.

23:28.975 --> 23:31.705
M. Allison Hart,
attorney for Victor Tillman.

23:33.312 --> 23:35.224
This looks cozy.

23:35.248 --> 23:38.227
Have you read my client
his rights?

23:38.251 --> 23:41.118
Uh, he hasn't been charged
with a crime.

23:42.155 --> 23:43.952
Then release him.

23:45.224 --> 23:47.002
Charge him or release him.

23:47.026 --> 23:48.504
What's the confusion?

23:48.528 --> 23:51.907
Were you planning
to interrogate him

23:51.931 --> 23:54.710
without an attorney present
until he

23:54.734 --> 23:56.178
incriminated himself in some way

23:56.202 --> 23:59.148
that you find beneficial
for your investigation?

23:59.172 --> 24:01.817
Oh, man, what a car wreck.

24:01.841 --> 24:03.252
He didn't ask for a lawyer.

24:03.276 --> 24:04.920
And you didn't offer.

24:04.944 --> 24:07.556
Chick's mowing McGee down;
He doesn't even know it.

24:07.580 --> 24:09.480
She seems to be enjoying it.

24:11.350 --> 24:14.163
You've already violated my
client's right to his privacy.

24:14.187 --> 24:16.432
His financial records
were accessed today

24:16.456 --> 24:18.100
without proper authorization,

24:18.124 --> 24:21.270
and I have reason to believe
that you were the source.

24:21.294 --> 24:24.752
Maybe you're the one who
should be charged with a crime.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.684
McGee.

24:35.708 --> 24:36.936
Let's go, Tillman.

24:45.585 --> 24:47.563
Miss Hart...

24:47.587 --> 24:49.798
your client...

24:49.822 --> 24:52.067
hiding behind a lawyer...

24:52.091 --> 24:53.769
it makes me wonder why.

24:53.793 --> 24:57.339
I can see your mind is spinning,
Mr. Gibbs,

24:57.363 --> 25:01.276
but once the hamster gains
some traction on the wheel

25:01.300 --> 25:03.445
and you figure out the questions

25:03.469 --> 25:07.082
you want to ask, you feel free
to contact me directly.

25:07.106 --> 25:08.784
Not my client.

25:08.808 --> 25:10.853
Were you ever a redhead?

25:10.877 --> 25:13.121
'Cause it sure feels
like I know you.

25:13.145 --> 25:14.923
No.

25:14.947 --> 25:17.693
But I know you.

25:17.717 --> 25:19.795
I know you take any shortcut
to a conviction.

25:19.819 --> 25:22.598
Really? Doesn't sound like me.

25:22.622 --> 25:23.832
You look the other way

25:23.856 --> 25:25.334
when your team hacks
privileged information,

25:25.358 --> 25:28.971
when they break into a police
impound lot and steal evidence,

25:28.995 --> 25:32.474
when they start a bar fight.

25:32.498 --> 25:35.978
Just out of curiosity...

25:36.002 --> 25:39.836
do you have any respect
at all for the law?

25:46.846 --> 25:50.259
You and your client are free
to go, Miss... Hart.

25:50.283 --> 25:52.308
I know.

26:07.500 --> 26:09.478
What kind of name is Mallison?

26:09.502 --> 26:10.812
It's M. Allison Hart.

26:10.836 --> 26:12.347
I think they're missing
some punctuation.

26:12.371 --> 26:15.450
Oh. So, a guy dies
in a jet pack explosion,

26:15.474 --> 26:16.985
and she won't let us talk

26:17.009 --> 26:18.987
to the guy
that manufactures jet packs?

26:19.011 --> 26:20.322
That's just mean.

26:20.346 --> 26:22.357
We don't know that he died
in the explosion.

26:22.381 --> 26:23.525
He was poisoned.

26:23.549 --> 26:24.760
I found that.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.562
But you didn't determine
whether he was poisoned

26:26.586 --> 26:29.131
to death or just to some level
of discomfort.

26:29.155 --> 26:30.632
Well, the thing about poison

26:30.656 --> 26:32.367
is that the human body
doesn't want it,

26:32.391 --> 26:35.237
so when it's ingested,
it does its best to expel it.

26:35.261 --> 26:38.106
See, there was a high level
of warfarin in Sayers' system,

26:38.130 --> 26:40.108
but his organs are so destroyed,

26:40.132 --> 26:42.978
it's impossible to tell whether
it was the cause of death.

26:43.002 --> 26:45.213
You don't see the flaw
in this logic, Palmer?

26:45.237 --> 26:47.683
You mean the part about how he
strapped himself to a jet pack

26:47.707 --> 26:49.151
and flew around
and blew up and that he

26:49.175 --> 26:50.819
couldn't have done all that
while already being dead?

26:50.843 --> 26:51.987
Yeah.

26:52.011 --> 26:53.488
Yeah, I don't know.

26:53.512 --> 26:54.740
It's a neat trick, though.

26:56.048 --> 26:57.192
Ooh.

26:57.216 --> 26:59.194
Ooh, what?

26:59.218 --> 27:01.396
Ooh, this.

27:01.420 --> 27:03.098
Okay, we know the fuel source.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.601
Combination of hydrogen peroxide
and kerosene.

27:05.625 --> 27:08.904
Definitely combustible, but what
was the source of ignition?

27:08.928 --> 27:11.506
What causes
a catalytic reaction?

27:11.530 --> 27:14.176
Well, you mix them together
the wrong way.

27:14.200 --> 27:17.212
Bingo.
Redirect the flow of kerosene

27:17.236 --> 27:19.581
from the exit port
of the motor...

27:19.605 --> 27:21.450
Back into the H2O2 tank, and...

27:21.474 --> 27:23.518
Kaboom.

27:23.542 --> 27:25.420
All you'd need
is a movable valve,

27:25.444 --> 27:28.123
and this rocket belt
would self-destruct.

27:28.147 --> 27:32.427
So, how does this valve
get reversed?

27:32.451 --> 27:35.364
This isn't a valve, Palmer.

27:35.388 --> 27:36.598
Right.

27:36.622 --> 27:39.401
It's our smoking gun,
and whoever made it

27:39.425 --> 27:42.070
is our killer.

27:42.094 --> 27:44.706
I'm just getting settled in.

27:44.730 --> 27:47.576
Victor dragged his feet as long
as possible through the divorce.

27:47.600 --> 27:49.044
You split everything equally?

27:49.068 --> 27:50.345
We split.

27:50.369 --> 27:51.947
There was nothing equal
about it.

27:51.971 --> 27:55.634
We shared a home,
an office, ambition...

27:57.977 --> 28:00.188
Whenever two people try
to extricate their lives

28:00.212 --> 28:02.124
from each other,
friction is inevitable.

28:02.148 --> 28:03.740
Hmm. Is that true, boss?

28:05.851 --> 28:07.796
These are Victor's designs?

28:07.820 --> 28:09.998
Victor's a genius, sure.

28:10.022 --> 28:13.068
Great. Do you have any idea
how annoying it can be

28:13.092 --> 28:16.238
to spend all your time
with a, quote, "brilliant man"?

28:16.262 --> 28:18.173
No.

28:18.197 --> 28:20.308
- What is that like?
- He could never listen

28:20.332 --> 28:21.543
to an idea that wasn't his.

28:21.567 --> 28:22.702
So stubborn.

28:24.737 --> 28:26.782
I do know what that is like.

28:26.806 --> 28:29.251
Huh. He ever get violent
with you?

28:29.275 --> 28:31.086
No.

28:31.110 --> 28:32.805
You ever get violent with him?

28:34.380 --> 28:36.758
It wasn't like that.

28:36.782 --> 28:39.995
I wanted to experiment
with fuels.

28:40.019 --> 28:41.196
Victor was myopic.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.498
Tunnel vision on his prototype.

28:43.522 --> 28:45.167
Just so we're clear,

28:45.191 --> 28:48.003
your marriage fell apart
because of jet packs?

28:48.027 --> 28:49.938
Because of communication.

28:49.962 --> 28:52.274
We could no longer communicate.

28:52.298 --> 28:54.676
You hired Sayers
to test your version.

28:54.700 --> 28:57.446
Yes, and I know
what that looks like,

28:57.470 --> 28:59.648
but the last test flight
was over a month ago.

28:59.672 --> 29:02.784
I can show you the records
if I could find them.

29:02.808 --> 29:05.470
He also kept you informed
on what Victor was up to.

29:07.079 --> 29:09.191
Since you could
no longer communicate.

29:09.215 --> 29:10.392
Sayers had experience.

29:10.416 --> 29:11.526
He was skilled.

29:11.550 --> 29:12.527
These are complicated machines,

29:12.551 --> 29:14.162
whatever the design.

29:14.186 --> 29:16.031
They all look the same.

29:16.055 --> 29:17.799
There are a myriad
of differences, believe me.

29:17.823 --> 29:20.519
This one uses the same
fuel source that killed Sayers.

29:21.761 --> 29:23.138
I didn't give him the pack,

29:23.162 --> 29:24.806
if that is what you're implying.

29:24.830 --> 29:26.408
Is that what you

29:26.432 --> 29:27.490
were implying, Mr. Gibbs?

29:29.068 --> 29:30.512
Don't say another word,
Ms. Tillman.

29:30.536 --> 29:31.680
You are entitled

29:31.704 --> 29:33.682
to legal counsel.

29:33.706 --> 29:34.716
She's your client, too?

29:34.740 --> 29:36.151
If she wishes to be.

29:36.175 --> 29:38.553
And I would advise her
at this time

29:38.577 --> 29:40.655
to refrain from speaking to you.

29:40.679 --> 29:43.024
You also represent
her ex-husband.

29:43.048 --> 29:44.993
That's not a conflict
of interest?

29:45.017 --> 29:47.596
My interest is justice,
Mr. Gibbs.

29:47.620 --> 29:48.663
Mine, too.

29:48.687 --> 29:51.266
Then we should get along
just fine.

29:51.290 --> 29:54.236
If you have any other inquiries
for either of my clients,

29:54.260 --> 29:56.438
feel free to contact me.

29:56.462 --> 29:58.054
No, thanks. I already got one.

30:03.202 --> 30:05.347
Lone samurai playing both sides
against the middle.

30:05.371 --> 30:07.749
It's like Yojimbo,
or A Fistful of Dollars,

30:07.773 --> 30:09.584
which is the Western remake
of Yojimbo,

30:09.608 --> 30:10.852
so it's really like Yojimbo.

30:10.876 --> 30:12.654
Sayers was test-flying
for both camps,

30:12.678 --> 30:15.457
and the pack that kills him
is made of pieces

30:15.481 --> 30:16.992
of both of their designs.

30:17.016 --> 30:18.160
Oh, yeah, you're right.

30:18.184 --> 30:19.427
Why do you sound surprised?

30:19.451 --> 30:20.896
You just said the same thing.

30:20.920 --> 30:23.365
No, I was talking about
the lawyer, not the pilot.

30:23.389 --> 30:25.634
She must have represented
the Tillmans as a couple.

30:25.658 --> 30:27.402
I don't think that's
the connection here.

30:27.426 --> 30:28.570
Figure it out.

30:28.594 --> 30:29.805
I want to know the endgame.

30:29.829 --> 30:31.706
Which one,
the lawyer or the pilot?

30:31.730 --> 30:33.308
Both of them.

30:33.332 --> 30:35.076
I'm confused.

30:35.100 --> 30:37.078
Time of death, Duck?

30:37.102 --> 30:40.382
I'm trying to determine
the sequence of events

30:40.406 --> 30:42.017
that ended Sayers' life.

30:42.041 --> 30:44.452
There are so many threads left
to disentangle.

30:44.476 --> 30:46.488
You got no time of death?

30:46.512 --> 30:49.743
You haven't even given me
a definitive cause of death.

30:53.752 --> 30:56.220
It-It is a frustrating case.

30:59.258 --> 31:01.837
That lawyer woman, Ducky.

31:01.861 --> 31:04.272
She's trying to keep me
from talking

31:04.296 --> 31:06.341
to anybody that matters.

31:06.365 --> 31:07.609
If I didn't know better,

31:07.633 --> 31:09.835
I would say
she's getting to you.

31:11.303 --> 31:13.181
She acts like she hates me,

31:13.205 --> 31:16.685
but she talks like she...
likes me.

31:16.709 --> 31:18.486
Ever been married to her?

31:18.510 --> 31:21.456
Yeah, that would explain it,
wouldn't it?

31:21.480 --> 31:23.792
Come on, tell me
you got something.

31:23.816 --> 31:26.094
Well...

31:26.118 --> 31:30.265
Sayers' helmet shielded his face
from the burst of the explosion

31:30.289 --> 31:33.535
and the subsequent attention
his corpse drew

31:33.559 --> 31:35.604
from the native wildlife.

31:35.628 --> 31:37.706
However, I found acidic erosion

31:37.730 --> 31:40.709
inside his throat
and inside his nasal cavities.

31:40.733 --> 31:42.844
It appears to be stomach acid.

31:42.868 --> 31:45.013
- He vomited.
- Violently.

31:45.037 --> 31:46.414
Profusely.

31:46.438 --> 31:49.251
However, Abby found
no corresponding acid

31:49.275 --> 31:51.152
on the inside
of his face shield.

31:51.176 --> 31:53.788
What does that mean?

31:53.812 --> 31:56.625
Somebody cleaned him up, and
then put the helmet back on him?

31:56.649 --> 31:58.560
Likely.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.662
I strongly doubt
that he was conscious

32:00.686 --> 32:02.330
when he was strapped
into the harness.

32:02.354 --> 32:04.766
He was...

32:04.790 --> 32:07.002
Well, it's possible he was...

32:07.026 --> 32:09.654
He was what?

32:11.897 --> 32:13.308
Flying dead?

32:13.332 --> 32:16.062
Well, explain that.

32:21.040 --> 32:23.018
It's a remote control receiver?

32:23.042 --> 32:24.319
Yes, it is.

32:24.343 --> 32:25.720
What is the range?

32:25.744 --> 32:27.255
Almost a kilometer.

32:27.279 --> 32:28.623
I don't speak Canadian.

32:28.647 --> 32:29.958
How far is that?

32:29.982 --> 32:31.226
Sayers' pack

32:31.250 --> 32:33.662
could be remotely operated
or remotely detonated.

32:33.686 --> 32:35.497
We did not see anything
like this

32:35.521 --> 32:37.065
in either
of the Tillman designs.

32:37.089 --> 32:39.067
It has to be one of them.

32:39.091 --> 32:40.568
Does it? Maybe we're looking

32:40.592 --> 32:41.803
for a completely different
fabricator here.

32:41.827 --> 32:43.171
Maybe it's neither
of the Tillmans'.

32:43.195 --> 32:45.273
- Yeah, boss?
- Hey, I want the Tillmans

32:45.297 --> 32:47.275
- and that lawyer person here.
- Okay, right away.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.911
Let's find out.

32:49.935 --> 32:53.148
We recovered this RF receiver
from the wreckage.

32:53.172 --> 32:55.450
Want to know which one of you
this belongs to.

32:55.474 --> 32:57.018
An RF receiver.

32:57.042 --> 32:58.353
What a stupid idea.

32:58.377 --> 32:59.754
Oh, because you
didn't think of it?

32:59.778 --> 33:01.356
Oh, this is your dumb idea?

33:01.380 --> 33:03.391
No, it's not mine,
but it's not dumb.

33:03.415 --> 33:05.940
Mr. Tillman, Ms. Tillman,
please.

33:11.290 --> 33:14.636
We're going to need to see your
inventory lists and blueprints

33:14.660 --> 33:15.870
so that we can confirm

33:15.894 --> 33:17.605
that neither of you
manufactured it.

33:17.629 --> 33:19.441
I will consider your request.

33:19.465 --> 33:22.410
It's not a request.

33:22.434 --> 33:25.413
Well, look at that...
a court order.

33:25.437 --> 33:27.415
Was that so hard?

33:27.439 --> 33:28.650
Wait a minute.

33:28.674 --> 33:30.719
Does he still think one of us
murdered Sayers?

33:30.743 --> 33:31.953
Oh, he was working both of you.

33:31.977 --> 33:33.822
Well, you insist that

33:33.846 --> 33:35.290
you didn't provide him
with the equipment.

33:35.314 --> 33:36.725
He must have stolen it.

33:36.749 --> 33:38.493
Well, then,
he was very good at it,

33:38.517 --> 33:39.761
because that's news to me.

33:39.785 --> 33:42.549
You knew he was stealing
from your husband.

33:44.690 --> 33:45.884
You...

33:49.361 --> 33:51.406
Mr. Gibbs,

33:51.430 --> 33:54.442
clearly, your intention here
is to stir up

33:54.466 --> 33:57.779
some animosity in the hopes
that an emotional outburst

33:57.803 --> 34:01.116
will reveal some insight
into your investigation.

34:01.140 --> 34:05.420
Or have you uncovered some facts
that need corroboration?

34:05.444 --> 34:06.755
I would hate to think

34:06.779 --> 34:09.456
that you brought us in here
under false pretenses.

34:09.481 --> 34:13.460
Time of death was 13 days ago.

34:13.485 --> 34:15.630
I was in the Bahamas.

34:15.654 --> 34:18.666
That's your idea of
a traditional winter vacation?

34:18.690 --> 34:21.123
No, it was Steve Bennett's idea.

34:22.494 --> 34:23.538
Where were you?

34:23.562 --> 34:24.672
New Hampshire.

34:24.696 --> 34:26.507
With that slut, Laura Truftin?

34:26.532 --> 34:28.275
- At least she likes sex!
- I like sex!

34:28.300 --> 34:30.011
- I just don't like sex with you!
- Ooh!

34:30.034 --> 34:32.435
Enough!

34:38.444 --> 34:40.054
I assume that's all.

34:40.079 --> 34:42.877
That's all? Fantastic.

34:45.484 --> 34:47.629
- Jerk.
- After you.

34:47.652 --> 34:51.565
Well, one of them ends up dead,
we won't have far to look.

34:51.590 --> 34:55.003
Would it be impossible
for you to apologize

34:55.027 --> 34:57.872
for implicating them
in Sayers' death?

34:57.896 --> 34:59.574
Yeah, they're off the hook.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.476
I expect we've seen the last
of each other

35:01.500 --> 35:02.777
as far as this case goes.

35:02.801 --> 35:04.179
I don't know.

35:04.203 --> 35:06.381
I might have to keep
my eye on you.

35:06.405 --> 35:08.216
Why?

35:08.240 --> 35:12.700
Doesn't seem like you have
a clue what you're doing.

35:25.457 --> 35:27.635
I think he's about
to have a thought.

35:27.659 --> 35:31.372
I think blood is about
to come out of his eyeballs.

35:31.396 --> 35:33.942
No, this is going
to be impressive.

35:33.966 --> 35:35.944
All right, this is
a remote control jet pack.

35:35.968 --> 35:37.629
That is what we
are looking at here.

35:39.571 --> 35:40.891
Okay, that wasn't
very impressive.

35:41.907 --> 35:43.118
Excuse me.

35:43.142 --> 35:44.486
It's very impressive.

35:44.510 --> 35:46.988
Do you understand
that countless tiny adjustments

35:47.012 --> 35:49.991
have to be made manually in
order to maintain level flight?

35:50.015 --> 35:52.560
It's an art flying a jet pack.

35:52.584 --> 35:55.263
That's why both the Tillmans
hired an expert pilot.

35:55.287 --> 35:57.899
- But...
- Wait. Let him go.

35:57.923 --> 35:59.400
He's building up to something.

35:59.424 --> 36:02.070
See, without a pilot, you'd need
a modified fly-by-wire system

36:02.094 --> 36:03.271
with computer-assisted
stabilization,

36:03.295 --> 36:04.606
but to build that,

36:04.630 --> 36:06.841
you would have to be
an expert engineer.

36:06.865 --> 36:08.810
So, are we looking

36:08.834 --> 36:11.598
for a pilot, or are we looking
for an engineer?

36:12.804 --> 36:14.616
Oh, there's a lightbulb.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.818
We're looking for both.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.901
Palmer, hand me
those blueprints.

36:20.812 --> 36:21.956
Yeah, that's right, boss.

36:21.980 --> 36:23.224
It's everything we found on her.

36:23.248 --> 36:24.859
- Got it.
- It was his!

36:24.883 --> 36:26.027
What was?

36:26.051 --> 36:27.195
The pack.

36:27.219 --> 36:28.830
It didn't belong
to either of the Tillmans.

36:28.854 --> 36:30.165
It belonged to Sayers.

36:30.189 --> 36:31.833
He built his own jet pack?

36:31.857 --> 36:33.635
The pack uses
fighter jet engineering.

36:33.659 --> 36:35.036
That's the missing piece.

36:35.060 --> 36:39.374
Sayers ripped off the technology
from both of the Tillmans and...

36:39.398 --> 36:42.410
He borrowed from the Navy, as
well, to build his own version,

36:42.434 --> 36:44.312
which used the best
of all three.

36:44.336 --> 36:45.680
But it crashed.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.649
So, it was not very good.

36:47.673 --> 36:48.750
That was the intention.

36:48.774 --> 36:50.185
The intention was to crash.

36:50.209 --> 36:53.321
To dispose of the body
where it wouldn't be discovered.

36:53.345 --> 36:55.190
It was pretty far off
the beaten path.

36:55.214 --> 36:57.192
Any decent pilot
could have flown it.

36:57.216 --> 36:58.993
How about a great pilot?

36:59.017 --> 37:01.029
Sheridan wanted the job
with Tillman.

37:01.053 --> 37:02.363
Petitioned the Navy for it.

37:02.387 --> 37:04.566
But Sayers took that,
then picked up a second one.

37:04.590 --> 37:06.334
Sheridan loses out twice,

37:06.358 --> 37:08.036
probably doesn't respond well
to that.

37:08.060 --> 37:10.004
Gonna pull the squadron's
psych profiles.

37:10.028 --> 37:12.907
Let's double-check their
paperwork, scan their files

37:12.931 --> 37:14.509
for engineering backgrounds.

37:14.533 --> 37:16.544
Need to talk to Gibbs.

37:16.568 --> 37:18.160
Where is Gibbs?

37:19.404 --> 37:20.996
Right here, Elf Lord.

37:32.117 --> 37:33.928
Boo!

37:33.952 --> 37:36.364
You're following me?

37:36.388 --> 37:38.099
You had my people followed.

37:38.123 --> 37:41.035
So, you had to even the score?

37:41.059 --> 37:43.371
No, I do my own legwork.

37:43.395 --> 37:45.673
So, what'd you find?

37:45.697 --> 37:47.675
A patent filing.

37:47.699 --> 37:49.410
Five years ago,

37:49.434 --> 37:51.879
you billed Victor Tillman
$400 an hour.

37:51.903 --> 37:53.948
My rates have gone up
since then.

37:53.972 --> 37:56.150
I bet, but on this case,
you waived your fees.

37:56.174 --> 37:57.552
You took them both pro bono.

37:57.576 --> 38:00.555
In my experience,

38:00.579 --> 38:03.124
the money is a by-product
of doing the right thing

38:03.148 --> 38:04.626
and doing it quite well.

38:04.650 --> 38:07.395
You know what, you weren't
looking for a big payday at all.

38:07.419 --> 38:10.031
- No?
- No, no, you were looking for me.

38:10.055 --> 38:12.233
Egocentric.

38:12.257 --> 38:14.135
You were looking
to pick a fight.

38:14.159 --> 38:15.470
I didn't pick this fight.

38:15.494 --> 38:17.189
But now that I met you...

38:18.830 --> 38:20.923
I'm glad to be in it.

38:24.503 --> 38:26.528
I just can't believe it,
Agent Gibbs.

38:27.572 --> 38:29.817
There was money
to be made, Captain.

38:29.841 --> 38:31.486
Sheridan wanted the job,

38:31.510 --> 38:32.887
and Sayers took it from him.

38:32.911 --> 38:34.956
There was another job
to be had, as well.

38:34.980 --> 38:36.291
Sayers got that one, too.

38:36.315 --> 38:37.892
I knew Banshee was competitive,

38:37.916 --> 38:39.661
but I never imagined
it would turn violent.

38:39.685 --> 38:41.262
Might not have.

38:41.286 --> 38:42.764
Yeah.

38:42.788 --> 38:44.399
Sayers was killed with poison.

38:44.423 --> 38:46.768
Likely slipped
into his food or drink.

38:46.792 --> 38:48.469
It's really not
all that violent.

38:48.493 --> 38:50.838
- More common with female killers, actually.
- Really?

38:50.862 --> 38:52.507
Yeah, really.

38:52.531 --> 38:55.143
We got a court order
to search the base for evidence,

38:55.167 --> 38:56.978
uh, starting
with Sheridan's locker.

38:57.002 --> 38:58.813
You sure?

38:58.837 --> 39:00.828
Yeah.

39:04.276 --> 39:07.355
Commander, a word.

39:07.379 --> 39:09.624
I got a hop in ten.

39:09.648 --> 39:11.092
Yeah, you're not going
to make that.

39:11.116 --> 39:12.860
You're proficient
with fly-by-wire technology?

39:12.884 --> 39:15.196
Course I am.

39:15.220 --> 39:16.631
Is this about Hondo?

39:16.655 --> 39:18.032
You know what happened to him?

39:18.056 --> 39:21.269
He was stealing tech secrets
from the Tillmans and the navy.

39:21.293 --> 39:24.572
Using pieces of all three
to build his own prototype.

39:24.596 --> 39:26.674
Complete with fly-by-wire.

39:26.698 --> 39:29.360
Could be controlled
with a remote like this one.

39:30.469 --> 39:32.347
He built this?
That's impossible.

39:32.371 --> 39:36.117
Hondo, he was a great fly boy,
but...

39:36.141 --> 39:37.385
Better than you?

39:37.409 --> 39:39.721
In some ways.

39:39.745 --> 39:41.556
But that's all he was.

39:41.580 --> 39:43.725
He couldn't build
a soapbox derby racer.

39:43.749 --> 39:45.793
Right, no engineering
background.

39:45.817 --> 39:47.128
That's why he needed a partner.

39:47.152 --> 39:48.296
That's who killed him.

39:48.320 --> 39:49.931
You were just saying
I was his competition.

39:49.955 --> 39:51.532
Now you're saying
I'm his partner?

39:51.556 --> 39:53.701
No.

39:53.725 --> 39:56.871
If the guy partnered up with
Sayers to build a prototype,

39:56.895 --> 39:58.806
he wouldn't have destroyed
the only one.

39:58.830 --> 40:00.908
There's got to be another one
around here somewhere.

40:00.932 --> 40:02.477
Here he comes.

40:02.501 --> 40:05.561
We just need it to look
like you're our man, Banshee.

40:09.875 --> 40:11.866
He is going for it.

40:25.357 --> 40:26.701
Where is he?

40:26.725 --> 40:27.935
He's inside.

40:27.959 --> 40:29.728
This is the only way out.

40:35.400 --> 40:36.492
Wow!

40:38.103 --> 40:39.593
This is unbelievable!

40:43.708 --> 40:44.886
McGee, you got him?!

40:44.910 --> 40:46.502
I'm scanning frequencies.

40:52.951 --> 40:54.629
McGee!

40:54.653 --> 40:56.054
All right, I'm locked on.

40:57.556 --> 40:59.057
Got him.

41:00.392 --> 41:03.805
Bringing him back, boss.

41:03.829 --> 41:06.774
Oh, here he comes. It works!

41:06.798 --> 41:09.528
Oh, this is sweet.

41:10.969 --> 41:13.815
- He's like a hummingbird. I want to fly him.
- No.

41:13.839 --> 41:14.816
Tony, stop it!

41:14.840 --> 41:16.284
You're going to break it!

41:16.308 --> 41:18.606
- Get him down!
- All right, I'm bringing him down, boss.

41:21.246 --> 41:22.246
He's coming.

41:26.818 --> 41:27.876
Hands in the air.

41:32.324 --> 41:34.292
Let's go, Rocket Man.

41:39.764 --> 41:41.209
Hey, where's McGee?

41:41.233 --> 41:42.510
Hey, boss.

41:42.534 --> 41:44.912
He's, uh, resting
his fried circuits.

41:44.936 --> 41:46.681
I don't know
what the big deal is.

41:46.705 --> 41:48.616
Just a little rocket science.

41:48.640 --> 41:51.619
Yeah, it's not like
it's brain surgery.

41:51.643 --> 41:52.820
I want to see
more pictures of her.

41:52.844 --> 41:54.505
Yeah, me, too.

41:55.547 --> 41:57.625
All right.

41:57.649 --> 41:59.927
I get your fascination, boss.

41:59.951 --> 42:01.295
She's a spellbinder.

42:01.319 --> 42:04.413
You could get lost
in those icy blue eyes.

42:07.993 --> 42:10.972
You know what
was a little weird, though?

42:10.996 --> 42:12.974
How she seemed to know me
before we met.

42:12.998 --> 42:14.876
Not just me, either. You.

42:14.900 --> 42:16.834
- Us.
- That one right there.

42:18.303 --> 42:20.294
Is that her and Colonel Bell?

42:26.011 --> 42:27.855
Bell sent her.

42:27.879 --> 42:29.891
How did you know?

42:29.915 --> 42:32.860
Her hand, his shoulder.

42:32.884 --> 42:35.352
Photo has been cropped.

42:43.328 --> 42:45.796
You got that off a pinkie?

42:47.032 --> 42:49.523
What do you think they're up to?
