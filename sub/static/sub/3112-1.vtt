Well, anyway,

she has met a man,

16:28.666 --> 16:30.415
Alan,

16:30.416 --> 16:34.249
and the problem is, they don't
have any common language,

16:34.250 --> 16:37.565

translate for them.

- No, don't be. I think...

She speaks Mandarin,

- Hokkien?
- Mm-hm.

that I can't remember.

and Vietnamese.

- They're Cambodian Chinese.
- Right.

Yeah, she speaks six
languages altogether.

- Apart from English.
- Lazy bitch.

your mum over for dim sum.

in the spare room.

her in there too soon.

I don't think sheltered
accommodation is good for her.

19:54.500 --> 19:56.815
RICHARD: You should come out to her.

19:58.791 --> 20:01.732
So she can come here
and live with us instead.

22:35.500 --> 22:36.957
She doesn't mind.

Can you say to her that I'm sorry that
I didn't come and visit her sooner

22:42.833 --> 22:46.499
but that there was a lot
to do after Kai's death,

22:46.500 --> 22:48.332
a lot of reorganising and so forth?

22:48.333 --> 22:51.957
And obviously I don't speak Mandarin
and she doesn't speak English.

- Shall I say that again?
- Um... no, I got it.

23:05.625 --> 23:10.415
Um... there's still
a lot to organise,

but if she would like to come
round one day when she's free,

she could look through his stuff
and take away what she likes.

Are you giving her the belongings
you no longer want to keep?

23:39.833 --> 23:40.999
No.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.624
No, they're not his rejects.
They're his things.

- (STIRRING)
- I've been thinking

30:22.666 --> 30:25.357
about putting my mum
in a sheltered home.

30:25.875 --> 30:29.415
I've been reading about this place.
It's really interesting.

30:29.416 --> 30:32.665
The decor is made to look
like the '50s and '60s

30:32.666 --> 30:35.249
so the elderly can feel younger.

30:35.250 --> 30:38.274
It takes them back to, like,
a younger, happier time.

30:39.791 --> 30:43.232
I doubt they'll have mid-century
furniture from Cambodia.

30:43.833 --> 30:46.665
Stop being so clever.
Always have to have the last say.

30:46.666 --> 30:49.690
- That's not true.
- It's not just the decor.

30:50.541 --> 30:53.482
They actively encourage
them to help themselves.

30:54.708 --> 30:57.540
I thought it was because
she needed looking after.

30:57.541 --> 31:00.274
See? You're doing it again.

31:05.625 --> 31:09.315
Slight memory loss is not serious.

31:09.416 --> 31:11.690
Her memory loss is not slight.

31:12.500 --> 31:16.315
It's not just the memory loss.
It's not even about her memory.

31:16.791 --> 31:18.607
You know this.

31:19.750 --> 31:22.815
- Are you gunning for a fight?
- No, of course I'm not.

31:30.416 --> 31:32.774
You look so conflicted.

31:35.750 --> 31:37.690
Relax your forehead.

31:41.708 --> 31:43.565
Here.

31:45.708 --> 31:47.565
Relax it there.

31:56.458 --> 31:58.499
Bring her over to stay with us, then.

31:58.500 --> 32:01.899
Are you mad? That would
be sui-fucking-cidal.

32:03.875 --> 32:05.649
What choice do you have?

32:09.458 --> 32:11.857
How long can you keep this up?

32:13.666 --> 32:16.415
- You can't lock her up forever.
- I'm not locking her up.

32:16.416 --> 32:19.524
- For fuck's sake, Richard!
- Sorry. I didn't...

32:20.250 --> 32:22.274
I didn't mean that.

32:27.416 --> 32:30.690
I just don't know what to say
to you about this anymore.

32:33.666 --> 32:36.315
You have my absolute support.

32:37.583 --> 32:39.940
And you know you have to tell her.

32:45.333 --> 32:49.290
If you think about it,
we're constantly coming out to people,

32:49.291 --> 32:51.940
so really you should be good at it.

32:54.083 --> 32:56.332
If only she liked you.

32:56.333 --> 32:58.482
It would make this a lot easier.

32:59.416 --> 33:02.190
But for some reason she
thinks you're a dick.

33:04.791 --> 33:07.107
You love this dick.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.374
I can't stay too long today, Alan.

33:27.375 --> 33:30.874
OK, well, we'll just
do the best we can.

33:30.875 --> 33:32.290
You have a few hours with me.

33:32.291 --> 33:34.832
Then it's back to flirting
and kissing, I'm afraid.

33:34.833 --> 33:37.232
Oh. Goody, goody!

33:45.875 --> 33:48.249
VANN: She'd like you to leave.

33:48.250 --> 33:51.107
She feels awkward with so
many people watching her.

33:54.166 --> 33:55.565
OK.

33:59.458 --> 34:00.857

they're not that important,

34:11.500 --> 34:12.831

34:12.833 --> 34:16.415
I start wondering
whether I've asked them

34:16.416 --> 34:19.748
and then I forget to ask them.

Can I... Can I ask 'em?

Hm... qiaokeli.

you can have it for dessert."

taken you here, right on this table.

up on people. It's rude.

- Hm.

Yes, you may clear the table.

- Did you have a nice meal?
- Yeah, until you arrived.

- Easy, now.
- Have you got it?

- You know.

- Yes.

52:07.250 --> 52:10.440
Well, clearly there isn't a bat.

half a tablet in here.

(VANN TRANSLATES)

01:11:57.375 --> 01:11:59.040
VANN: Why are you doing this?

01:11:59.041 --> 01:12:00.832
I'm here to help you.

01:12:00.833 --> 01:12:03.649
Do you want to live the
rest of your life here?

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.899
(VANN TRANSLATES)

01:12:12.666 --> 01:12:14.582
You don't need to feel sorry for me,

01:12:14.583 --> 01:12:16.249
for her.

01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:19.207
- She doesn't need your help.
- You are so damn stubborn.

01:12:19.208 --> 01:12:20.957
I'm trying to help you.

01:12:20.958 --> 01:12:23.540
You're making me feel
like it's my fault.

01:12:23.541 --> 01:12:26.149
(VANN TRANSLATES)

01:12:28.250 --> 01:12:30.249
VANN: What are your true intentions?

01:12:30.250 --> 01:12:31.374
To help you.

01:12:31.375 --> 01:12:32.815
(VANN TRANSLATES)

01:12:33.416 --> 01:12:37.024
- Why are you doing this?
- Stop asking that dumb question!

01:12:40.875 --> 01:12:42.915
You've taken away
my only... her only...

01:12:42.916 --> 01:12:45.290
Me, her, my? Which is it?
Come on, Vann!

01:12:45.291 --> 01:12:47.499
You can't even separate
between you and her.

01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:49.107
Whose side are you on?

01:12:49.541 --> 01:12:52.249
VANN:
You've taken away her only family

01:12:52.250 --> 01:12:55.524
and now she's stuck
in this awful place.

01:12:57.333 --> 01:13:00.499
If you hadn't been
so dependent on Kai,

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:02.524
he would never have put you in here.

01:13:03.166 --> 01:13:06.732
What were you doing?
You were piling on pressure.

01:13:06.833 --> 01:13:09.649
What fucking differences
can't you work out with Alan?

01:13:31.666 --> 01:13:35.249
VANN: This is your guilt.
She doesn't want to be your therapist.

01:13:35.250 --> 01:13:36.649
(SIGHS)

01:13:39.916 --> 01:13:43.857
I'm trying to help you get
out of this awful place.

01:13:44.208 --> 01:13:47.107
(VANN TRANSLATES)

01:13:48.333 --> 01:13:51.874
Alan is an old man.
You will break his heart.

01:13:51.875 --> 01:13:55.940
(VANN TRANSLATES)

01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:00.415
If you had adapted to this culture,

01:14:00.416 --> 01:14:03.374
Kai wouldn't have had to look
after every facet of your life.

01:14:03.375 --> 01:14:05.690
Honestly, your medication,

01:14:05.916 --> 01:14:08.440
your bank details, everything.

01:14:08.541 --> 01:14:11.024
You choked him with guilt.

01:14:11.458 --> 01:14:14.957
And who's looking after you now?
Kai? No, it's me.

01:14:14.958 --> 01:14:16.624
I wonder why that is?

01:14:16.625 --> 01:14:18.982
(VANN TRANSLATES)

01:14:34.666 --> 01:14:38.149
RICHARD: That's it, run away.
That's the solution, isn't it?

01:14:43.166 --> 01:14:44.774
I'm sorry.

01:14:46.166 --> 01:14:47.499
I just fucked it up.

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:50.607
Her one chance of happiness
and I fucking screwed that up.

01:14:51.708 --> 01:14:53.107
Fuck!

01:14:53.833 --> 01:14:56.315
I just fucking screwed
everything up again.

01:15:28.041 --> 01:15:30.190
These are all of Kai's things.

01:15:31.208 --> 01:15:32.832
Er...

01:15:32.833 --> 01:15:34.832
I've probably forgotten something

01:15:34.833 --> 01:15:38.940
but... if I come across anything,
I'll send it on to you.

01:15:48.916 --> 01:15:51.374
RICHARD:
How are things between her and Alan?

01:15:51.375 --> 01:15:54.357
(VANN TRANSLATES)

01:15:56.291 --> 01:15:58.899
VANN: She hasn't seen him.

01:16:10.625 --> 01:16:12.399
It never bothered me...

01:16:14.166 --> 01:16:16.857
that she couldn't assimilate
into this culture.

01:16:23.625 --> 01:16:25.832
It bothered Kai.

01:16:25.833 --> 01:16:27.565
(VANN TRANSLATES)

01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:43.482
Kai was gay.

01:16:45.833 --> 01:16:48.024
I'm his boyfriend.

01:16:51.375 --> 01:16:53.982
We'd been together
for over four years.

01:16:55.125 --> 01:16:59.232
(VANN TRANSLATES)

01:17:08.041 --> 01:17:11.274
And he was going to tell you
the last time that you saw him.

01:17:12.708 --> 01:17:15.399
But he got so panicked,
he couldn't do it.

01:17:17.666 --> 01:17:20.482
He was afraid that
you'd love him less.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.607
Stupid.

01:17:24.666 --> 01:17:28.524
So he invited you over
for dinner the next day

01:17:29.166 --> 01:17:34.357
and he told me to walk round the
block while he came out to you.

01:17:36.333 --> 01:17:39.024
And on his way to get the bus,

01:17:40.666 --> 01:17:43.690
he got hit by that fucking
cunt of a driver.

01:18:13.916 --> 01:18:16.899
I can't help but wonder...

01:18:17.375 --> 01:18:20.190
what would have happened
if I had driven him.

01:18:21.875 --> 01:18:23.249
Cos he...

01:18:23.250 --> 01:18:26.315
I offered but he liked
to take the bus.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.857
I know you miss him.

01:18:35.625 --> 01:18:37.482
I don't know what to do.

01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:44.024
I miss him tremendously.

01:19:18.416 --> 01:19:20.399
(JUNN)

01:22:01.875 --> 01:22:03.607
Kai.
