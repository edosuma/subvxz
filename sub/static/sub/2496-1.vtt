01:18:09.059 --> 01:18:12.279
<i>They both enjoyed it
and had seen it with a nostalgia</i>

01:18:12.438 --> 01:18:14.111
<i>for their old times together.</i>

01:18:14.273 --> 01:18:19.905
<i>They made love that night
and have been together ever since.</i>

01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:23.495
<i>Dylan finally read Jane Austen's
pre-Victorian classic,</i>

01:18:23.657 --> 01:18:25.159
<i>"Sense and Sensibility".</i>

01:18:25.326 --> 01:18:28.455
<i>He found it neither sentimental
nor unrealistic</i>

01:18:28.621 --> 01:18:30.965
<i>but actually quite relatable.</i>

01:18:32.333 --> 01:18:35.337
<i>Soon after their encounter
outside the Hudson Playhouse,</i>

01:18:35.502 --> 01:18:37.550
<i>Beatrice gave up
her modelling exploits</i>

01:18:37.713 --> 01:18:40.011
<i>and formed a jazz ensemble
with Dylan.</i>

01:18:40.174 --> 01:18:43.804
<i>They achieved moderate success
and were happy.</i>

01:18:43.969 --> 01:18:47.940
<i>Consequently,
they both put on 15 pounds.</i>

01:18:48.098 --> 01:18:53.855
<i>Conrad and Dylan continued their weekly
conversations over squash</i>

01:18:54.021 --> 01:18:57.446
<i>and, for the first time, Dylan won.</i>

01:18:57.608 --> 01:19:00.361
<i>Conrad saw this as a sign of change.</i>

01:19:00.527 --> 01:19:05.784
<i>Dylan, however, merely felt
a sense of satisfaction.</i>

01:19:08.285 --> 01:19:11.880
<i>Conrad would go on to donate
a large portion of his wealth</i>

01:19:12.039 --> 01:19:15.293
<i>to various charities
and philanthropic endeavours.</i>

01:19:15.459 --> 01:19:18.383
<i>Unfortunately,
it took losing everything</i>

01:19:18.545 --> 01:19:22.470
<i>for Conrad to finally appreciate
the economic stability he once had.</i>

01:19:22.633 --> 01:19:26.934
<i>He wasn't going to take it
for granted this time.</i>

01:19:29.431 --> 01:19:31.525
<font color="#808080">CONRAD:</font> I really despise
the whole idea

01:19:31.684 --> 01:19:34.278
that by being over-privileged
and well educated,

01:19:34.436 --> 01:19:36.734
that one has to live up
to certain lofty expectations.

01:19:36.897 --> 01:19:39.366
For one, you have to live
under the proverbial shadow

01:19:39.525 --> 01:19:41.823
of said father and/or namesake.

01:19:41.986 --> 01:19:45.866
Two, lofty expectations
can only lead to failure, hmm?

01:19:46.031 --> 01:19:49.581
And three, more scientifically
and mathematically speaking,

01:19:49.743 --> 01:19:52.496
if your parents were a great success,
I think a betting man would say

01:19:52.663 --> 01:19:54.165
that the chances
of lightning striking twice,

01:19:54.331 --> 01:19:57.585
especially in consecutive generations,
is very slim.

01:19:57.751 --> 01:20:02.052
You do realise you're talking
to your chauffeur?

01:20:02.214 --> 01:20:04.308
Touché.

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:07.891
<i>After the lukewarm reception
of his second novel,</i>

01:20:08.053 --> 01:20:11.557
<i>Conrad began to spend more time
in the country</i>

01:20:11.724 --> 01:20:14.443
<i>to focus on the work,</i>

01:20:14.601 --> 01:20:18.651
<i>for it was only there
that he felt at ease.</i>

01:20:18.814 --> 01:20:21.943
<i>It appeared Conrad's allergies
to grass and clean air</i>

01:20:22.109 --> 01:20:24.453
<i>had been completely psychosomatic.</i>

01:20:24.611 --> 01:20:28.161
<i>He began to reflect back
on his week with Beatrice</i>

01:20:28.324 --> 01:20:29.701
<i>and thought of the old adage,</i>

01:20:29.867 --> 01:20:34.213
<i>"'Tis better to have loved and lost than
to have never loved at all. "</i>

01:20:34.371 --> 01:20:40.003
<i>Conrad reluctantly agreed, for
he still thought of Beatrice often.</i>

01:20:40.169 --> 01:20:43.639
<i>At the ripe age of 42,</i>

01:20:43.797 --> 01:20:49.054
<i>Conrad Valmont
was finally growing up.</i>
