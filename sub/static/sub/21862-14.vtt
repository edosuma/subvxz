Welcome to the grand opening

01:05.416 --> 01:07.000
<c.speaker>of the <i>Bienvenido </i>Bridge!

01:07.000 --> 01:10.416
<c.speaker>Linking the kingdoms
of Avalor and Cordoba.

01:10.416 --> 01:13.250
<c.speakerTop>This bridge
was the result
of much hard work

01:13.250 --> 01:15.208
<c.speakerTop>on the part
of Princess Elena.

01:15.208 --> 01:16.750
<c.speakerTop>And Prince Alonso!

01:16.750 --> 01:18.458
<c.speakerTop>[groans]

01:18.458 --> 01:21.208
<c.speakerTop>We hope this bridge
between our two kingdoms

01:21.208 --> 01:23.291
<c.speakerTop>brings everyone
closer together.

01:23.291 --> 01:25.291
<c.speaker>Well said,
King Juan Ramon.

01:25.291 --> 01:28.375
<c.speaker>So, now it is
with great pleasure

01:28.375 --> 01:31.208
<c.speaker>that we officially
open the bridge.

01:31.208 --> 01:33.166
<c.speaker>[crowd cheering]

01:33.166 --> 01:36.250
<c.speaker>You know,
this was my first
big royal project.

01:36.250 --> 01:38.000
<c.speaker>And thanks to
your dedication,

01:38.000 --> 01:39.375
<c.speaker>it is
a huge success.

01:39.375 --> 01:41.083
<c.speaker>What about my dedication?

01:41.083 --> 01:42.416
<c.speaker>I helped, too.

01:42.416 --> 01:44.416
<c.speaker>Yes, you helped
awaken the Yacalli

01:44.416 --> 01:46.416
<c.speaker>and almost got
our palace destroyed.

01:46.416 --> 01:47.583
<c.speaker>I remember that
very well.

01:50.208 --> 01:52.458
<c.speaker>The key word is "almost!"

01:52.458 --> 01:54.208
<c.speaker>[sighs]

02:16.125 --> 02:18.166
<c.speaker>Aah! Is everyone okay?

02:18.166 --> 02:19.333
<c.speaker>What was that?

02:19.333 --> 02:20.458
<c.speaker>The <i>monfuego. </i>

02:20.458 --> 02:21.875
<c.speaker>It hasn't been active

02:21.875 --> 02:23.291
<c.speaker>for at least 100 years.

02:23.291 --> 02:25.291
<c.speaker>The rock monster
who lives on it

02:25.291 --> 02:26.416
<c.speaker>has been in a
deep slumber.

02:26.416 --> 02:28.291
<c.speaker>They are called
<i>"rocadors..." </i>

02:28.291 --> 02:30.208
<c.speaker>And it looks like
this one just woke up.

02:30.208 --> 02:32.083
<c.speaker>And not in a good mood!

02:32.083 --> 02:35.083
<c.speaker>-[rumbling]
-[all exclaiming]

02:35.083 --> 02:36.458
<c.speaker>If the <i>monfuego </i>
erupts,

02:36.458 --> 02:38.083
<c.speaker>it will destroy
the bridge!

02:38.083 --> 02:39.625
<c.speaker>It's okay.
I dealt with

02:39.625 --> 02:40.875
<c.speaker>a <i>rocador </i>
once before.

02:40.875 --> 02:42.458
<c.speaker>It's his anger
that's making

02:42.458 --> 02:43.583
<c.speaker>the <i>monfuego </i>active.

02:43.583 --> 02:44.875
<c.speaker>So, we just need
to go up there

02:44.875 --> 02:46.583
<c.speaker>and find out
why he's so upset.

02:46.583 --> 02:47.750
<c.speaker>But who should we send?

02:47.750 --> 02:50.125
<c.speaker>I will speak
to the <i>rocador. </i>

02:50.125 --> 02:52.291
<c.speaker>Hmm, like the time
you spoke to the Yacalli

02:52.291 --> 02:54.291
<c.speaker>and got him so angry
he nearly destroyed
the palace?

02:55.500 --> 02:56.958
<c.speaker>[shrieks]

02:56.958 --> 02:59.250
<c.speaker>Ugh! Are you ever gonna
let me forget that?

02:59.250 --> 03:00.958
<c.speaker>I've changed.

03:00.958 --> 03:02.333
<c.speaker>You say you have changed,

03:02.333 --> 03:03.875
<c.speaker>but I have seen
no evidence of it.

03:03.875 --> 03:06.208
<c.speaker>Actions speak
louder than words.

03:06.208 --> 03:07.458
<c.speaker>[Elena] You know,

03:07.458 --> 03:08.708
<c.speaker>the <i>rocador  </i>
in my kingdom

03:08.708 --> 03:10.208
<c.speaker>is a really
good friend.

03:10.208 --> 03:12.000
<c.speaker>I can ask him to go
up to the <i>monfuego </i>

03:12.000 --> 03:13.291
<c.speaker>and find out
what's going on.

03:13.291 --> 03:14.958
<c.speaker>Ah, excellent idea.

03:14.958 --> 03:18.000
<c.speaker>In the meantime,
we will close the bridge
until it is safe.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.958
<c.speaker>I could also use
Prince Alonso's help

03:23.958 --> 03:26.458
<c.speaker>in case there are
any local customs
we need to know.

03:26.458 --> 03:27.750
<c.speaker>Yes! Thank you!

03:27.750 --> 03:29.000
<c.speaker>I would be more than happy

03:29.000 --> 03:31.166
<c.speaker>to assist Princess Elena.

03:31.166 --> 03:33.500
<c.speaker>Very well, but remember

03:33.500 --> 03:35.708
<c.speaker>we must keep
the <i>monfuego  </i>
from erupting.

03:35.708 --> 03:37.083
<c.speaker>It's not just
the bridge,

03:37.083 --> 03:38.708
<c.speaker>but our people
we have to protect.

03:38.708 --> 03:40.291
<c.speaker>I promise you,
Father,

03:40.291 --> 03:41.875
<c.speaker>I will
take care of this.

03:41.875 --> 03:44.125
<c.speaker>Oh, no. We have to
take care of this, Elena.

03:44.125 --> 03:45.500
<c.speaker>I've been doing
everything I can

03:45.500 --> 03:47.583
<c.speaker>to show my father
that I've changed.

03:47.583 --> 03:49.375
<c.speaker>Why can't he see
I'm a new man

03:49.375 --> 03:52.375
<c.speaker>who puts others' needs
before my own? Thank you!

03:53.750 --> 03:56.083
<c.speaker>[Elena] Maybe instead
of thinking about what

03:56.083 --> 03:58.291
<c.speaker>you'll get out of it,
you can start thinking
about how to solve

03:58.291 --> 03:59.708
<c.speaker>-the problem.
-You're right!

03:59.708 --> 04:01.500
<c.speaker>Let's go fetch
your rock monster.

04:01.500 --> 04:03.375
<c.speaker>Oh, he's not
a monster.

04:03.375 --> 04:04.458
<c.speaker>His name is...

04:04.458 --> 04:05.458
<c.speaker>Charoca!

04:05.458 --> 04:06.833
<c.speaker>Found you again!

04:06.833 --> 04:09.375
<c.speaker>-You're it!
-[all laugh]

04:09.375 --> 04:11.583
<c.speaker>How about now we play
<i>my </i>favorite game?

04:11.583 --> 04:13.375
<c.speaker>Hotscotch!

04:15.958 --> 04:17.750
<c.speaker>Uh, maybe next time.

04:17.750 --> 04:19.208
<c.speaker>[children panting]

04:21.000 --> 04:22.583
<c.speaker>I guess it's just
you and me, Crystal.

04:22.583 --> 04:24.500
<c.speaker>Again.

04:24.500 --> 04:25.708
<c.speaker>[Elena] Charoca!

04:26.708 --> 04:29.166
<c.speaker>[gasps]
Princess Elena!

04:29.166 --> 04:31.583
<c.speaker>Oh, it's good to
see you, Princess!

04:31.583 --> 04:32.875
<c.speaker>Who's your friend?

04:32.875 --> 04:35.291
<c.speaker>Prince Alonso
of Cordoba.

04:35.291 --> 04:38.291
<c.speaker>Charoca, remember
that bridge project
I told you about?

04:38.291 --> 04:39.458
<c.speaker>Oh, the one you
were working on

04:39.458 --> 04:41.000
<c.speaker>with that rude,
selfish prince

04:41.000 --> 04:42.166
<c.speaker>that woke up
the Yacalli.

04:44.458 --> 04:46.708
<c.speaker>I'm not like that anymore!

04:46.708 --> 04:49.458
<c.speaker>Whoa, whoa, you need
to chill out, my friend.

04:49.458 --> 04:51.583
<c.speaker>Well, today was
the grand opening
of that bridge,

04:51.583 --> 04:54.250
<c.speaker>but the <i>rocador  </i>
who lives on the
nearby <i>monfuego </i>

04:54.250 --> 04:56.250
<c.speaker>woke up
in a bad mood.

04:56.250 --> 04:58.458
<c.speaker>There's a <i>rocador  </i>
in Cordoba?

04:58.458 --> 05:01.291
<c.speaker>Oh, I was starting to think
I was the only one left.

05:01.291 --> 05:03.375
<c.speaker>Apparently not!
And we were hoping

05:03.375 --> 05:05.250
<c.speaker>you could maybe
come talk to him?

05:05.250 --> 05:07.333
<c.speaker>Anything for you,
Princess Elena.

05:07.333 --> 05:09.416
<c.speaker>Plus, I get to meet
another <i>rocador. </i>

05:14.708 --> 05:16.083
<c.speaker>[Charoca]
Yep, you have

05:16.083 --> 05:18.333
<c.speaker>one unhappy <i>rocador  </i>
up there,

05:18.333 --> 05:20.000
<c.speaker>but I have some
great calming tips.

05:22.625 --> 05:24.416
<c.speaker>[Elena gasps]
There he is!

05:24.416 --> 05:26.291
<c.speaker>He has a rock garden, too!

05:26.291 --> 05:27.291
<c.speaker>Shh!

05:28.500 --> 05:29.833
<c.speaker>Okay, we'll stay here while

05:29.833 --> 05:31.583
<c.speaker>you go find out
why he's so upset.

05:31.583 --> 05:33.583
<c.speaker>And tell him
the prince
of his kingdom

05:33.583 --> 05:35.333
<c.speaker>commands him
to calm down!

05:35.333 --> 05:37.875
<c.speaker>Uh, just ask him
what's wrong first,

05:37.875 --> 05:39.458
<c.speaker>and we'll go
from there.

05:39.458 --> 05:40.875
<c.speaker>You got it, Princess!

05:44.875 --> 05:46.458
<c.speaker>Hey there, buddy!

05:48.333 --> 05:50.583
<c.speaker>[gasps] Oh, hello!

05:50.583 --> 05:52.208
<c.speaker>[gasps]

05:52.208 --> 05:54.208
<c.speaker>[musical flourish]

06:01.708 --> 06:04.708
<c.speaker>Y-- You're a...

06:04.708 --> 06:05.875
<c.speaker>girl.

06:05.875 --> 06:08.125
<c.speaker>And you're not!

06:08.125 --> 06:10.125
<c.speaker>[sighs]

06:13.958 --> 06:16.083
<c.speaker>Charoca?
What happened up there?

06:16.083 --> 06:17.500
<c.speaker>Did the <i>rocador  </i>
do something?

06:17.500 --> 06:18.708
<c.speaker>What did he say?

06:18.708 --> 06:21.458
<c.speaker>She said, "Hello."

06:22.500 --> 06:23.958
<c.speaker>She?

06:23.958 --> 06:25.875
<c.speaker>[gasps] Oh!

06:25.875 --> 06:27.083
<c.speaker>Oh, what?

06:27.083 --> 06:29.500
<c.speaker>The <i>rocador  </i>
is not a "he".

06:29.500 --> 06:30.875
<c.speaker>It's a "she"!

06:30.875 --> 06:33.583
<c.speaker>Oh! [chuckles]

06:33.583 --> 06:36.083
<c.speaker>What's going on?

06:36.083 --> 06:37.500
<c.speaker>Why do I feel so weird?

06:37.500 --> 06:40.458
<c.speaker>Because you, my friend,
are in love.

06:40.458 --> 06:41.958
<c.speaker>Trust me.
I've seen that look

06:41.958 --> 06:44.708
<c.speaker>many a time before.

06:44.708 --> 06:47.208
<c.speaker>And it's great
because it means
you're gonna be

06:47.208 --> 06:51.166
<c.speaker>thrilled to see her again
when you go back up there.

06:51.166 --> 06:52.375
<c.speaker>I can't go back there!

06:52.375 --> 06:53.708
<c.speaker>She makes me so nervous!

06:53.708 --> 06:55.833
<c.speaker>I could barely sentence
a string together.

06:55.833 --> 06:57.958
<c.speaker>I mean, barely string
a sentence together.

06:57.958 --> 07:00.708
<c.speaker>How am I gonna talk her out
of destroying a bridge?

07:00.708 --> 07:02.708
<c.speaker>It's easy!
If you want someone

07:02.708 --> 07:04.000
<c.speaker>to do something for you,

07:04.000 --> 07:05.833
<c.speaker>you just tell them
whatever they wanna hear.

07:05.833 --> 07:07.291
<c.speaker>I've been doing it
my whole life.

07:07.291 --> 07:09.416
<c.speaker>Or you could
just be honest.

07:09.416 --> 07:10.708
<c.speaker>Okay. Be honest.

07:10.708 --> 07:11.833
<c.speaker>Got it.

07:11.833 --> 07:13.833
<c.speaker>Wish me luck!

07:16.250 --> 07:17.750
<c.speaker>Just be cool, Charoca.

07:17.750 --> 07:20.083
<c.speaker>Be cool.
You can do this.

07:20.083 --> 07:21.291
<c.speaker>-[Charica]
You can do what?
-[Charoca yelps]

07:21.291 --> 07:23.583
<c.speaker>Uh... Hey! Hiya!

07:23.583 --> 07:26.708
<c.speaker>[musical flourish]

07:26.708 --> 07:28.000
<c.speaker>How you doing?

07:28.000 --> 07:30.125
<c.speaker>I am... [stammers]

07:30.125 --> 07:31.958
<c.speaker>Who am I? Uh...

07:31.958 --> 07:33.000
<c.speaker>I am Charoca.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.875
<c.speaker>Ooh! Good name!

07:34.875 --> 07:36.583
<c.speaker>I'm Charica!

07:36.583 --> 07:39.000
<c.speaker>Huh. I--

07:39.000 --> 07:40.500
<c.speaker>I like your
rock garden.

07:40.500 --> 07:41.708
<c.speaker>Oh, thanks!

07:41.708 --> 07:43.625
<c.speaker>It calms me down.

07:43.625 --> 07:45.250
<c.speaker>I guess you could say
I have a few

07:45.250 --> 07:47.375
<c.speaker>anger-management issues.

07:47.375 --> 07:49.416
<c.speaker>[gasps] Me, too!

07:49.416 --> 07:50.750
<c.speaker>Where are my manners?

07:50.750 --> 07:53.458
<c.speaker>I should introduce you
to everyone.

07:53.458 --> 07:58.000
<c.speaker>This is Mica,
and Topaz, and Jewel.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.833
<c.speaker>And over there
are-are-are--

07:59.833 --> 08:01.416
<c.speaker>You name
your rocks?

08:01.416 --> 08:03.583
<c.speaker>[chuckles] Yeah.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.625
<c.speaker>I guess it makes me
feel sort of...

08:05.625 --> 08:06.833

08:06.833 --> 08:07.833
<c.speaker>Exactly!

<c.speaker>I mean, our--
our idea worked.

11:30.625 --> 11:34.000
<c.speaker>So, I never asked.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.208
<c.speaker>How did you wind up
on my <i>monfuego? </i>

11:36.208 --> 11:40.958
<c.speaker>Oh, well, uh,
the truth is...

11:40.958 --> 11:43.000
<c.speaker>I wanted to talk to you
about the new bridge.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
<c.speaker>Ugh! Don't even
get me started!

11:46.000 --> 11:49.500
<c.speaker>All I want is peace and quiet,

11:49.500 --> 11:52.458
<c.speaker>but no!
Someone built a bridge

11:52.458 --> 11:55.750
<c.speaker>with all the rattling
and clacking, and noise!

11:55.750 --> 11:58.000
<c.speaker>And it makes me so mad
I could just...

11:58.000 --> 12:00.625
<c.speaker>Aah! [roars]

12:00.625 --> 12:02.458
<c.speaker>Okay, okay, okay.

12:02.458 --> 12:04.875
<c.speaker>Just-- Just breathe.

12:04.875 --> 12:07.875
<c.speaker>Out with the hot.
[exhales]

12:07.875 --> 12:09.250
<c.speaker>In with the cool.

12:09.250 --> 12:12.500
<c.speaker>[breathing deeply]

12:12.500 --> 12:14.875
<c.speaker>[sighs] Sorry about that.

12:14.875 --> 12:17.458
<c.speaker>So, what did you wanna
tell me about the bridge?

12:17.458 --> 12:20.000
<c.speaker>The bridge?
Oh, the bridge!

12:20.000 --> 12:21.250
<c.speaker>Right.

12:21.250 --> 12:23.000
<c.speaker>Well, I was going to ask you

12:23.000 --> 12:25.375
<c.speaker>if it would be okay if, uh...

12:25.375 --> 12:26.708
<c.speaker>If what?

12:26.708 --> 12:29.000
<c.speaker>If I told you

12:29.000 --> 12:31.250
<c.speaker>how much that bridge
bothers me, too.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.875
<c.speaker>That's why I came up here.

12:32.875 --> 12:34.208
<c.speaker>To complain about
that noisy bridge.

12:34.208 --> 12:37.458
<c.speaker>I'm so happy
you feel the same way!

12:37.458 --> 12:39.625
<c.speaker>[gasps] You know
what I should do?

12:39.625 --> 12:41.958
<c.speaker>I should make
the <i>monfuego </i>erupt!

12:41.958 --> 12:44.416
<c.speaker>Ha! Then lava will
wipe that bridge

12:44.416 --> 12:45.833
<c.speaker>right on out of here!

12:45.833 --> 12:47.458
<c.speaker>No! No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

12:47.458 --> 12:50.458
<c.speaker>No need for that
because-- be... cause

12:50.458 --> 12:54.083
<c.speaker>I am going to take care
of that bridge for you.

12:54.083 --> 12:56.458
<c.speaker>[gasps] You are?

12:56.458 --> 12:58.000
<c.speaker>Yep, I'm gonna
shut it down

12:58.000 --> 12:59.458
<c.speaker>so there'll be
no more noise

12:59.458 --> 13:01.875
<c.speaker>and you can just relax,
and keep all that lava

13:01.875 --> 13:04.291
<c.speaker>right up in the <i>monfuego  </i>
where it belongs.

13:04.291 --> 13:07.000
<c.speaker>Oh, Charoca!
Thank you!

13:07.000 --> 13:10.875
<c.speaker>Okay. I better go, uh...
take care of that bridge.

13:12.958 --> 13:16.250
<c.speaker>Oh, after all the trouble
he's going through,

13:16.250 --> 13:19.708
<c.speaker>I should do something
nice for him, but what?

13:19.708 --> 13:23.083
<c.speaker>[gasps] Oh, yeah!

13:28.208 --> 13:29.291
<c.speaker>There he is!

13:29.291 --> 13:31.291
<c.speaker>The <i>rocador </i>of romance!

13:31.291 --> 13:33.250

<c.speaker>Roco Suave!

13:35.166 --> 13:37.458
<c.speaker>Okay, okay.
How'd it go with her?

13:37.458 --> 13:40.125
<c.speaker>Well, on one level,
it went great.

13:40.125 --> 13:42.375
<c.speaker>Oh! I'm so relieved.

13:42.375 --> 13:44.125
<c.speaker>[Elena] Thank you
for saving the bridge.

13:46.250 --> 13:47.583
<c.speaker>Yeah... [laughs]

13:47.583 --> 13:49.083
<c.speaker>About that.
Funny story.

13:49.083 --> 13:50.375
<c.speaker>[Charoca]
It turns out

13:50.375 --> 13:52.958
<c.speaker>Charica doesn't like
the bridge so much.

13:52.958 --> 13:54.625
<c.speaker>In fact,
she hates it.

13:54.625 --> 13:57.083
<c.speaker>It's what's
making her
so upset.

13:57.083 --> 13:59.416
<c.speaker>Then how did you get her
to calm down?

13:59.416 --> 14:01.000
<c.speaker>Yeah, what did you say?

14:01.000 --> 14:03.250
<c.speaker>I... might have said

14:03.250 --> 14:04.750
<c.speaker>something about
closing it down.

14:04.750 --> 14:07.000
<c.speaker>What? We can't
close the bridge!

14:07.000 --> 14:10.583
<c.speaker>-[Charoca] I know. I...
-[Elena] Then why'd you
say that?

14:10.583 --> 14:12.250
<c.speaker>It's like Alonso said,

14:12.250 --> 14:14.375
<c.speaker>I-I-I told her what
she wanted to hear.

14:14.375 --> 14:17.083
<c.speaker>[Charica] You did what?!

14:17.083 --> 14:19.500
<c.speaker>-You lied to me?
-[both gasp]

14:19.500 --> 14:21.166
<c.speaker>[rumbling]

14:21.166 --> 14:25.083
<c.speaker>No! I-I mean,
I didn't mean to.

14:25.083 --> 14:27.166
<c.speaker>[stammering]
Let me explain!

14:27.166 --> 14:29.083
<c.speaker>You've said enough!

14:29.083 --> 14:30.958
<c.speaker>-[roars]
-Charica!

14:30.958 --> 14:33.958
<c.speaker>-[Charoca] Wait!
-[both exclaiming]

14:38.166 --> 14:41.166
<c.speaker>Uh, Charoca, why weren't you
just honest with her?

14:41.166 --> 14:43.833
<c.speaker>Because she really liked me,

14:43.833 --> 14:45.583
<c.speaker>and I didn't wanna ruin it.

14:45.583 --> 14:46.750
<c.speaker>Well, guess what?

14:46.750 --> 14:48.208
<c.speaker>You did ruin it.

14:48.208 --> 14:50.208
<c.speaker>Because he took your advice!

14:50.208 --> 14:52.250
<c.speaker>I was just trying
to save the bridge.

14:52.250 --> 14:54.500
<c.speaker>I get it.
You want your father
to be proud of you,

14:54.500 --> 14:56.250
<c.speaker>and you wanted her
to like you,

14:56.250 --> 14:58.166
<c.speaker>but lying isn't
the way to do it!

14:58.166 --> 15:01.291
<c.speaker>But no one's ever
liked me that way before.

15:01.291 --> 15:03.625
<c.speaker>Then you have
two problems
to fix now.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.416
<c.speaker>[sighs] You're right.

15:07.416 --> 15:10.250
<c.speaker>This bridge is
too important to you.

15:10.250 --> 15:12.708
<c.speaker>And she's too important to me.

15:12.708 --> 15:14.083
<c.speaker>We'll go with you.

15:14.083 --> 15:15.583
<c.speaker>Alonso?

15:15.583 --> 15:17.625
<c.speaker>Maybe my father's
right about me.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.166
<c.speaker>I mess everything up.

15:19.166 --> 15:22.000
<c.speaker>Look, you're being
too hard on yourself.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.083
<c.speaker>You're right!
It's all Charoca's fault.

15:25.083 --> 15:27.208
<c.speaker>And now you're being
too easy on yourself.

15:27.208 --> 15:29.583
<c.speaker>Alonso, you could still
help us fix this,

15:29.583 --> 15:32.250
<c.speaker>-but we need to go now!
-[Prince Alonso exclaims]

15:40.333 --> 15:41.250
<c.speaker>Where is she?

15:41.250 --> 15:43.083
<c.speaker>Wait.

15:43.083 --> 15:44.291
<c.speaker>There's only
one place she'd go

15:44.291 --> 15:45.291
<c.speaker>at a time like this.

16:02.583 --> 16:04.000
<c.speaker>[Charica sniffling]

16:04.000 --> 16:05.166
<c.speaker>[crying]

16:08.166 --> 16:09.875
<c.speaker>What are you doing here?

16:09.875 --> 16:12.458
<c.speaker>I wanted to tell you the truth.

16:12.458 --> 16:13.708
<c.speaker>Get back!

16:14.708 --> 16:15.875
<c.speaker>[both] Aah!

16:15.875 --> 16:17.166
<c.speaker>Don't worry, guys.

16:17.166 --> 16:18.750
<c.speaker>I can handle this problem.

16:18.750 --> 16:22.458
<c.speaker>Oh, so now I'm
a problem, am I?

16:24.083 --> 16:26.750
<c.speaker>The truth is
they're my friends,

16:26.750 --> 16:28.333
<c.speaker>and they're worried
about their bridge.

16:28.333 --> 16:30.208
<c.speaker>That's the real reason
I came here.

16:30.208 --> 16:32.625
<c.speaker>So, you're not
getting rid of it.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.583
<c.speaker>I wish I could,

16:34.583 --> 16:36.166
<c.speaker>but it's really
important to them.

16:36.166 --> 16:39.291
<c.speaker>So, everything
you told me,

16:39.291 --> 16:41.000
<c.speaker>it was all a lie?

16:41.000 --> 16:44.375
<c.speaker>No! The way I feel for you
isn't a lie!

16:44.375 --> 16:46.708
<c.speaker>I've never felt this way
about anyone.

16:46.708 --> 16:48.958
<c.speaker>I-I think...

16:48.958 --> 16:52.208
<c.speaker>I think I love you, Charica.

16:54.375 --> 16:56.333
<c.speaker>Well, that's too bad

16:56.333 --> 16:58.708
<c.speaker>because I don't even
like you anymore.

16:58.708 --> 17:00.958
<c.speaker>[glass shatters]

17:00.958 --> 17:03.958
<c.speaker>[Charica crying]

17:07.875 --> 17:10.375
<c.speaker>[Charica sobbing]

17:14.000 --> 17:15.250
<c.speaker>I told her the truth,

17:15.250 --> 17:17.166
<c.speaker>and she still
won't forgive me.

17:17.166 --> 17:19.500
<c.speaker>What do I do, Elena?

17:19.500 --> 17:21.375
<c.speaker>Now that I've met her, I--

17:21.375 --> 17:22.708
<c.speaker>I can't live without her.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.375
<c.speaker>Aww.

17:24.375 --> 17:26.166
<c.speaker>Wait! I know
what to do!

17:26.166 --> 17:28.250
<c.speaker>All right, look,
telling my father

17:28.250 --> 17:29.875
<c.speaker>that I've changed
wasn't enough.

17:29.875 --> 17:32.583
<c.speaker>He said actions
speak louder than words.

17:32.583 --> 17:33.583
<c.speaker>So, you have to--

17:33.583 --> 17:35.250
<c.speaker>Oh, no.

17:35.250 --> 17:36.625
<c.speaker>I'm not taking any more
of your advice.

17:36.625 --> 17:38.583
<c.speaker>No, Alonso's right!

17:38.583 --> 17:40.166
<c.speaker>Surprisingly.

17:40.166 --> 17:41.583
<c.speaker>You have to show her
how you feel.

17:41.583 --> 17:43.166
<c.speaker>Not tell her.

17:43.166 --> 17:46.416
<c.speaker>Show her? Okay.

17:46.416 --> 17:50.416
<c.speaker>Yeah, but it's gotta
be something big.

17:50.416 --> 17:51.500
<c.speaker>Something that
would make her

17:51.500 --> 17:54.750
<c.speaker>the happiest <i>rocador  </i>
in the world.

17:56.375 --> 17:58.333
<c.speaker>-I got it!
-[both] What?

17:58.333 --> 18:00.708
<c.speaker>You'll see,
but it could get

18:00.708 --> 18:02.291
<c.speaker>a little warm
around here.

18:08.875 --> 18:11.000
<c.speaker>You know what,
Charica?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.583
<c.speaker>You should be mad at me

18:12.583 --> 18:15.333
<c.speaker>because I was
a stone-cold liar!

18:15.333 --> 18:18.166
<c.speaker>And I'm not doing anything
to shut down that bridge.

18:18.166 --> 18:22.250
<c.speaker>Leave my <i>monfuego </i>now!

18:22.250 --> 18:24.083
<c.speaker>Well, I'm not
going anywhere!

18:24.083 --> 18:25.708
<c.speaker>And that bridge is
just gonna keep on

18:25.708 --> 18:28.250
<c.speaker>banging and clanging
and making noise!

18:29.583 --> 18:32.125
<c.speaker>[growls, roars]

18:32.125 --> 18:34.416
<c.speaker>[rumbling]

18:34.416 --> 18:36.416
<c.speaker>If you don't
get out of here,

18:36.416 --> 18:39.458
<c.speaker>I will make that
<i>monfuego </i>erupt!

18:39.458 --> 18:40.875
<c.speaker>What's he doing?

18:40.875 --> 18:42.125
<c.speaker>[sighs]
I don't know!

18:42.125 --> 18:43.833
<c.speaker>Go ahead!

18:43.833 --> 18:45.250
<c.speaker>'Cause that's
the only way

18:45.250 --> 18:47.875
<c.speaker>you're gonna get rid
of that bridge or me!

18:47.875 --> 18:49.125
<c.speaker>Fine!

18:49.125 --> 18:50.833
<c.speaker>I'll get rid
of both of you!

18:50.833 --> 18:53.500
<c.speaker>[Charica roaring]

18:53.500 --> 18:54.625
<c.speaker>[roaring continues]

18:54.625 --> 18:56.000
<c.speaker>Charoca!

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
<c.speaker>[roaring]

19:05.083 --> 19:06.333
<c.speaker>[grunting]

19:10.208 --> 19:11.458
<c.speaker>Yah!

19:20.291 --> 19:21.250
<c.speaker>What is he doing?

19:26.375 --> 19:28.708
<c.speaker>Almost... Ah!

19:30.958 --> 19:33.000
<c.speaker>[straining]

19:36.458 --> 19:38.375
<c.speaker>[sighs]

19:38.375 --> 19:40.500
<c.speaker>Are you okay?

19:40.500 --> 19:42.375
<c.speaker>I couldn't get
rid of the bridge,

19:42.375 --> 19:45.458
<c.speaker>but this will block the noise.

19:48.083 --> 19:50.750
<c.speaker>It's so quiet...

19:50.750 --> 19:52.416
<c.speaker>and beautiful!

19:52.416 --> 19:53.458
<c.speaker>[gasps]

19:53.458 --> 19:56.000
<c.speaker>You got me angry on purpose

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
<c.speaker>so I would make
the <i>monfuego </i>erupt

19:59.000 --> 20:03.625
<c.speaker>so you could do all this for me!

20:03.625 --> 20:06.166
<c.speaker>[sighs] I may have
a heart of stone,

20:06.166 --> 20:10.458
<c.speaker>but you made it melt.

20:10.458 --> 20:13.250
<c.speaker>I love you, Charoca.

20:16.708 --> 20:17.708
<c.speaker>Whew!

20:17.708 --> 20:19.500
<c.speaker>I will never

20:19.500 --> 20:21.166
<c.speaker>lie to you again.

20:21.166 --> 20:22.875
<c.speaker>-You better not.
-Whoa!

20:22.875 --> 20:24.416
<c.speaker>-[thuds]
-Ooh, sorry!

20:24.416 --> 20:25.708
<c.speaker>[laughs]

20:25.708 --> 20:27.208
<c.speaker>Ahh.

20:27.208 --> 20:30.708
<c.speaker>Charica, I want you
to meet my friends.

20:30.708 --> 20:33.458
<c.speaker>This is Crown Princess
Elena of Avalor.

20:33.458 --> 20:35.458
<c.speaker>And Prince Alonso
of Cordoba.

20:35.458 --> 20:38.291
<c.speaker>Hi. Sorry we
woke you up.

20:38.291 --> 20:39.375
<c.speaker>That's okay.

20:39.375 --> 20:42.833
<c.speaker>You gave me something
worth waking up to.

20:42.833 --> 20:44.625
<c.speaker>So, you're cool with the bridge?

20:44.625 --> 20:46.625
<c.speaker>I've never been cooler.

20:46.625 --> 20:48.458
<c.speaker>All right!
Then let's go

20:48.458 --> 20:50.291
<c.speaker>re-grand open
that bridge!

20:50.291 --> 20:52.166
<c.speaker>[King Juan Ramon]
Without further ado,

20:52.166 --> 20:54.083
<c.speaker>the <i>Bienvenido </i>Bridge

20:54.083 --> 20:56.083
<c.speaker>is now open...

20:56.083 --> 20:57.583
<c.speaker>-again!
-[cheers]

21:02.083 --> 21:05.458
<c.speaker>Alonso, you promised me
you would take care of this,

21:05.458 --> 21:07.416
<c.speaker>and you kept your word.

21:07.416 --> 21:09.083
<c.speaker>I'm proud of you, son.

21:09.083 --> 21:12.875
<c.speaker>Hmm. Thank you, but to
tell you the truth,

21:12.875 --> 21:15.875
<c.speaker>my bad advice
almost ruined everything.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.125
<c.speaker>Charoca really deserves
all the credit.

21:18.125 --> 21:21.416
<c.speaker>Because he followed
Alonso's good advice.

21:21.416 --> 21:24.958
<c.speaker>Either way, it's Charoca
you should be proud of.

21:24.958 --> 21:27.750
<c.speaker>So, you could've
not said anything,

21:27.750 --> 21:30.708
<c.speaker>but you chose to be
honest and humble.

21:30.708 --> 21:33.000
<c.speaker>Two qualities which
will serve you well

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
<c.speaker>when your time comes
to rule this kingdom.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
<c.speaker>Well done, <i>míjo. </i>

21:38.000 --> 21:39.416
<c.speaker>Aww.

21:43.583 --> 21:45.875
<c.speaker>You know,
I'm proud of you, too.

21:46.875 --> 21:48.375
<c.speaker>Uh, not that proud.

21:48.375 --> 21:50.583
<c.speaker>[chuckles] So, when
are you and Charoca

21:50.583 --> 21:51.833
<c.speaker>headed back to Avalor?

21:51.833 --> 21:53.583
<c.speaker>I'm not sure Charoca's

21:53.583 --> 21:55.708
<c.speaker>heading back anytime soon.
