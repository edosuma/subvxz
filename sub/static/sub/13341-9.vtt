WEBVTT

01:04.291 --> 01:06.375
Grandma's going to die.

01:06.375 --> 01:09.625
What?
But I thought it was
just a broken femur.

01:09.625 --> 01:11.625
No, now she has pneumonia.

01:11.625 --> 01:13.708
The doctors don't think
she's gonna make it.

01:13.708 --> 01:16.625
Well, can't they do
something about that?

01:16.625 --> 01:18.667
Hannah, Grandma's dying.

01:18.667 --> 01:22.959
You have to come
see her before she dies,
if that matters to you.

01:22.959 --> 01:25.125
Of course
it matters to me.

01:25.125 --> 01:28.333
Then just get here now.

01:28.333 --> 01:30.834
Okay.

01:30.834 --> 01:32.667
Okay, I'm coming.

01:38.875 --> 01:41.083
I'm really sorry
I can't come.

01:41.083 --> 01:45.333
I really understand.
It's not a great time
to leave town.

01:45.333 --> 01:47.291
I just can't miss
the first week
of rehearsals.

01:47.291 --> 01:50.291
I think it sets
a really bad precedent.

01:50.291 --> 01:52.000
Yeah, I totally get it.
I really do.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.834
I just hope I have a chance
to say good-bye to my grandma.

01:53.834 --> 01:55.375
It's not like
we were that close.

01:55.375 --> 01:56.500
She was a really
good grandma,

01:56.500 --> 01:58.208
and she always cut out
the "Cathy" cartoons for me

01:58.208 --> 02:00.458
and mailed them
to me on Fridays.

02:00.458 --> 02:02.208
The only thing I remember
about my grandma

02:02.208 --> 02:05.041
is she had really rough skin
and she spit a lot.

02:05.041 --> 02:09.250
My grandma's, like, very neat,
and she had skin like
a kitten's ear.

02:09.250 --> 02:10.875
( groans )

02:12.583 --> 02:15.417
I miss you even when
you're gone for a night.

02:15.417 --> 02:19.125
Yeah, but you're gonna have
so much fun with all your
new theater friends.

02:20.291 --> 02:22.500
- But I can't do this...
- No!

02:22.500 --> 02:24.542
- with my theater friends.
- ( laughing )

02:24.542 --> 02:28.208
- No. ( giggling )
- ( groaning )

02:45.750 --> 02:47.417
Hannah:
Hi, Aunt Margo.

02:47.417 --> 02:52.083
- Oh, thank God
you are finally here.
- Hey.

02:52.083 --> 02:54.750
I'm losing my fucking mind
over all this.

02:54.750 --> 02:56.125
You okay, Aunt Margo?

02:56.125 --> 02:58.917
Am I okay?
That's a strange question,
Hannah, considering--

02:58.917 --> 03:00.875
no, I'm the one that's gotta
keep it all together

03:00.875 --> 03:02.583
so that everyone else
can fall apart.

03:02.583 --> 03:04.834
Look, just be prepared.
She looks terrible.

03:04.834 --> 03:06.875
And for God's sake,
please don't cry.

03:06.875 --> 03:10.166
- Okay.
- ( exhales )

03:11.583 --> 03:13.291
- Hi.
- Hannah.

03:13.291 --> 03:16.417
Hi, Grandma, hi.

03:16.417 --> 03:18.583
Well, you look nice.

03:18.583 --> 03:20.458
What did you do?

03:20.458 --> 03:22.041
I gained 15 pounds.

03:22.041 --> 03:23.583
Grandma Flo,
you look great.

03:23.583 --> 03:25.834
Well, I don't know
why that would be.

03:25.834 --> 03:29.750
And, besides, it stinks
to beat the band in here.

03:29.750 --> 03:32.959
It really does.
It smells like... pee?

03:32.959 --> 03:35.291
Can we talk to a nurse
about that?

03:35.291 --> 03:36.625
Oh, okay.

03:36.625 --> 03:38.542
Okay, Grandma,
how's your femur?

03:38.542 --> 03:40.625
I have two rods in my leg.

03:40.625 --> 03:41.959
Do you believe that?

03:41.959 --> 03:45.000
No, you do not seem
like the two-rod type.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.500
Yeah, now they're telling me
that I have pneumonia.

03:49.500 --> 03:50.792
Fuck.

03:50.792 --> 03:52.417
Grandma,
that's the worst.

03:52.417 --> 03:55.041
I had pneumonia when I was
little and I had to watch TV
for, like, two weeks.

03:55.041 --> 03:57.708
Well, it's not the same at all
when you're my age.

03:57.708 --> 04:00.000
Can you tell me
where your femur is
so I don't touch it?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.333
Hey, sweetie.

04:01.333 --> 04:03.458
Hi, Mommy!
Hey, how's it going?

04:03.458 --> 04:06.041
- Hi.
- Hi, Aunt Sissy. Hey.

04:06.041 --> 04:09.667
Oh, it is so great
when you all come to visit.

04:09.667 --> 04:12.250
She just lights up
like a Christmas tree.

04:12.250 --> 04:14.417
What are you talking about?
We're here all the time.

04:14.417 --> 04:16.250
I was here
for her last two MRIs.

04:16.250 --> 04:19.333
- Which I wanted to come to,
but you told me not to.
- Exactly.

04:19.333 --> 04:20.916
Well, I honestly
don't keep track

04:20.916 --> 04:22.667
of the comings and goings
of the both of you.

04:22.667 --> 04:24.166
Loreen:
I saw your calendar
in the kitchen.

04:24.166 --> 04:26.500
- You know what?
I must look like a fright.
- Mm-mm.

04:26.500 --> 04:30.208
Dipping your filthy fingers
into Mom's only water source
isn't gonna fix that.

04:30.208 --> 04:32.333
- Oh, God.
- Loreen.

04:32.333 --> 04:33.792
No, I'm fine.

04:33.792 --> 04:36.166
- Oh.
- Just didn't feel so great
there for a second.

04:36.166 --> 04:37.667
You've barely
eaten today.

04:37.667 --> 04:40.291
Hannah, why don't you
take your mom somewhere
to get something to eat?

04:40.291 --> 04:42.000
Well, she can just eat
what's on the tray.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.041
- Honey, let's go have lunch.
- Okay, got it.

04:44.041 --> 04:46.959
- Loreen: Be right back.
- Get her a sandwich.

04:46.959 --> 04:48.583
Hannah: Okay.

04:48.583 --> 04:49.834
Oh, boy.

04:49.834 --> 04:52.750
You think that
you've accepted

04:52.750 --> 04:54.667
that your mother
wasn't that good...

04:54.667 --> 04:58.041
and then you realize
that you've always
had this hope

04:58.041 --> 04:59.375
that there'd
be a conversation

04:59.375 --> 05:02.208
where the two of you
would have some kind
of breakthrough.

05:03.708 --> 05:05.125
When they die,

05:05.125 --> 05:08.542
that conversation
can never come.

05:08.542 --> 05:11.458
I don't totally
understand what made
her such a bad mother.

05:11.458 --> 05:13.291
I mean, like, she was
always very loving to me.

05:13.291 --> 05:16.083
That's not true,
not about your weight.

05:16.083 --> 05:18.708
She ruined Margo
and Sissy's lives.

05:18.708 --> 05:21.000
They're very
misshapen people.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.166
( sighs )

05:23.166 --> 05:26.083
Will you do me
a huge favor?

05:26.083 --> 05:28.417
Anything.

05:28.417 --> 05:31.208
Will you tell Grandma
that you're marrying Adam?

05:32.500 --> 05:33.875
What?

05:33.875 --> 05:37.875
It's just not much
is doing romantically
with her grandkids.

05:37.875 --> 05:41.208
I mean, Rebecca
is severely arrested.

05:41.208 --> 05:44.208
- I love her so much.
- But, Mom, I'm not
marrying Adam.

05:44.208 --> 05:47.291
She's going to die soon.
What does it matter?

05:47.291 --> 05:48.583
Mom, that's insane.

05:48.583 --> 05:52.333
- Just consider it? Please.
- Mom, no. No.

05:52.333 --> 05:55.750
Mom, I really thought
you were more progressive
than that.

05:55.750 --> 05:57.083
No, I'm not.

05:57.083 --> 05:59.291
What are they
even talking about
in your women's book group?

05:59.291 --> 06:01.083
That's crazy.

06:01.083 --> 06:02.917
Fine.

06:02.917 --> 06:05.333
Can I eat the rest
of this, please?

06:09.500 --> 06:12.417
Margo:
You never seem to get

06:12.417 --> 06:14.667
that it was inappropriate
to tell your cousin

06:14.667 --> 06:17.375
that her father
was convicted of
insider trading.

06:17.375 --> 06:20.041
- Yeah, but he was.
- She didn't need to know.

06:20.041 --> 06:21.834
She was six
fucking years old.

06:21.834 --> 06:23.875
Yeah, well, I was seven,
so why did anyone tell me?

06:23.875 --> 06:27.166
You insisted.
You've always insisted
about knowing everything.

06:27.166 --> 06:29.125
And the worst part
was when you told her

06:29.125 --> 06:31.417
she was never
gonna see him again.

06:31.417 --> 06:34.792
But she didn't, um,
ever see him again.

06:34.792 --> 06:36.083
Sissy, what's with you?

06:36.083 --> 06:38.959
You haven't said a word
since we left Mom's room.

06:38.959 --> 06:41.208
I was praying,
if you must know.

06:41.208 --> 06:43.708
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

06:43.708 --> 06:46.583
( keyboard clicking )

06:47.542 --> 06:49.458
( knocks )

06:49.458 --> 06:51.000
Hey.
Hi, Hannah.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.792
Hey, Rebecca. Hi.

06:53.792 --> 06:55.375
How's Grandma Flo?

06:55.375 --> 06:57.375
Oh, the old Flo-job.
You know her.

06:57.375 --> 06:58.875
Just sluttin' 'round.

06:58.875 --> 07:01.291
I don't think that's
a funny nickname for Grandma.

07:01.291 --> 07:04.208
Okay, sorry.
I was just really trying
to lighten the mood.

07:04.208 --> 07:06.000
Why weren't you
at the hospital?

07:06.000 --> 07:09.625
I left because I just
want to remember her
as she was.

07:09.625 --> 07:11.000
Yeah, totally.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.125
I'm, like,
having a lot of memories
of her, definitely.

07:14.125 --> 07:16.166
( typing continues )

07:16.166 --> 07:18.125
Okay, well, I think I have
to go to a Starbucks to study

07:18.125 --> 07:19.917
because I'm, like,
in the middle of exams

07:19.917 --> 07:23.834
and I just, like,
can't work here anymore.

07:23.834 --> 07:28.667
Yeah, and Starbucks
are usually really, like,
calm and quiet places.

07:30.625 --> 07:32.458
Great about med school.
So exciting.

07:32.458 --> 07:34.041
How are the, like,
hot doctors-to-be?

07:34.041 --> 07:35.667
I always watch
"Grey's Anatomy."

07:35.667 --> 07:37.083
I've never missed
an episode.

07:37.083 --> 07:39.667
I'm not, like, really
going there to meet a man.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.333
I actually really hate
when people say that

07:41.333 --> 07:43.041
because I feel
like it diminishes
what I'm doing.

07:43.041 --> 07:45.708
And, like, I'm
becoming a doctor myself;
I'm not trying to marry one.

07:45.708 --> 07:47.125
Like, I'm not
becoming a nurse.

07:47.125 --> 07:49.333
- Do you know?
- Okay, sorry.

07:49.333 --> 07:51.708
I didn't mean to make
your life ridiculous
and about sex.

07:51.708 --> 07:53.208
We really are
very proud of you.

07:53.208 --> 07:55.375
It's, like, a big deal
to have a doctor
in your family.

07:55.375 --> 07:58.458
And, anyway, now
I'm fulfilling my dream
of having someone I can text

07:58.458 --> 07:59.917
with my medical questions
at all hours.

07:59.917 --> 08:02.333
I'm not really studying
15 hours a day to fulfill
your  dream.

08:02.333 --> 08:03.750
It's a lot of
really hard work,

08:03.750 --> 08:05.500
but I guess I wouldn't
expect anyone in this family

08:05.500 --> 08:06.917
to understand that.
( scoffs )

08:06.917 --> 08:10.208
If nothing happens later,
do you want to go get a drink?

08:10.208 --> 08:12.667
Do you want to get
a drink with me?

08:12.667 --> 08:15.041
Yeah, that's why
I'm asking you.

08:15.041 --> 08:16.375
Sorry, but you're
just not really acting

08:16.375 --> 08:17.959
like I'm someone
you'd want to get
a drink with.

08:17.959 --> 08:19.500
Um, no, it's really
not about you.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.333
I just, like,
have a lot of
studying to do

08:21.333 --> 08:24.583
and I'm kind of
on a schedule and I feel
like maybe you're not--

08:24.583 --> 08:26.625
Sure, let's definitely
have a drink.

08:26.625 --> 08:29.250
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

08:29.250 --> 08:31.417
- Okay, so I'll see you later.
- Yes, a drink. Yes, yeah.

08:31.417 --> 08:33.166
- Okay, all right, bye.
- Bye.

08:34.250 --> 08:36.750
( quietly )
Bitch.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.041
Okay, one for you,

08:38.041 --> 08:40.750
one Oxycontin for you,
one for me.

08:40.750 --> 08:42.291
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

08:42.291 --> 08:45.250
Does anyone want
some Demerol?

08:45.250 --> 08:47.208
She fucking
has Demerol?

08:47.208 --> 08:50.291
Can I have more
of the Demerol?
It's for Joe's knee.

08:50.291 --> 08:51.959
I think you need
to lay off, Sissy.

08:51.959 --> 08:54.083
You're a little spacey.

08:54.083 --> 08:56.667
Oh, "Sissy spacey."
That's so funny.

08:56.667 --> 08:59.542
You know, I have been
giving her her drugs
this whole time.

08:59.542 --> 09:02.083
I know how to administer
Oxycontin.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.875
I know.
Why don't you
just take a rest?

09:04.875 --> 09:07.792
I mean, we're here now.
We-- we got this.

09:07.792 --> 09:10.125
All right, let's put
some more Post-its on things.

09:10.125 --> 09:12.959
Mm, I have somebody great
that can do the estate sale.

09:12.959 --> 09:14.625
You know what?
I don't want anything.

09:14.625 --> 09:17.333
- You don't want
anything?
- No.

09:17.333 --> 09:18.708
Okay.

09:18.708 --> 09:21.542
I mean, I know you
always loved that painting
with the snow on it.

09:21.542 --> 09:23.166
It doesn't matter.
She's going to be gone.

09:23.166 --> 09:25.834
- It doesn't matter.
- Oh, just put a Post-it
on something.

09:25.834 --> 09:29.375
Well, okay, fine.
I'll just take the ring.

09:29.375 --> 09:31.291
- What?
- Loreen: Which ring?

09:31.291 --> 09:32.917
The engagement ring.

09:32.917 --> 09:35.125
Well, that's all
I'm asking for.

09:35.125 --> 09:36.959
I'm not asking
for anything else.

09:36.959 --> 09:39.041
That is a family
heirloom.

09:39.041 --> 09:42.041
- We have daughters.
- We need to pass that on.

09:42.041 --> 09:44.834
Like I wouldn't pass it on
to one of the daughters.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.291
- That is Rebecca's ring.
- What?

09:47.291 --> 09:49.166
So because I don't
have children,

09:49.166 --> 09:50.458
I don't deserve a ring?

09:50.458 --> 09:53.834
You know, when Jerry Milburn
didn't show up for my prom...

09:53.834 --> 09:55.417
- Oh, Jesus.
- ( groans )

09:55.417 --> 09:57.000
Mom promised me
that ring. She did.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.041
Margo:
Oh, stop. So dramatic.

09:59.041 --> 10:00.834
Adam on phone:
Is your mom okay?

10:00.834 --> 10:02.000
Hannah:
Yeah, I mean, she's fine.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.875
I mean, like,
sad but fine.

10:03.875 --> 10:08.041
You know, it's some, like,
real circle-of-life shit.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.000
Hey, weird thing--

10:10.000 --> 10:12.417
- my Mom wants me
to tell my grandma...
- Yeah?

10:12.417 --> 10:14.166
...that we are
getting married.

10:14.166 --> 10:15.583
What?

10:15.583 --> 10:17.750
You know, she just wants me
to make her happy
before she dies

10:17.750 --> 10:21.083
by letting her know
that one of her grandchildren
is gonna have a good life.

10:21.083 --> 10:23.667
I mean, like, you know,
a good life by her standards.

10:23.667 --> 10:26.041
Why would
she want you to lie?

10:26.041 --> 10:29.208
Well, it's not, like,
a flat-out lie.

10:29.208 --> 10:31.875
Mm, well, but we're
not getting married.

10:33.875 --> 10:35.834
Do you mean, like, ever?

10:35.834 --> 10:38.708
Uh, do you want to?

10:39.708 --> 10:40.792
Uh, no.

10:40.792 --> 10:42.208
I always promised myself
I wouldn't get married

10:42.208 --> 10:43.583
until I had a swimming pool
in my living room.

10:43.583 --> 10:45.208
But I just felt like,
at some point,

10:45.208 --> 10:48.125
- I don't know, I thought
that it was something...
- Hey, we're back in.

10:48.125 --> 10:50.792
- ...that you were
thinking about, too.
- She wants to read act two.

10:50.792 --> 10:53.250
Oh, yeah. Okay, yeah.
Cool, thanks.

10:53.250 --> 10:55.792
Thanks.
I have to get back.

10:55.792 --> 10:59.083
Okay, just forget
we ever talked about this.

10:59.083 --> 11:00.583
Okay...

11:00.583 --> 11:02.708
I guess I just thought that
you were thinking about this

11:02.708 --> 11:05.667
in a more committed way,
so I'm feeling a little--

11:05.667 --> 11:08.291
I am.
I am very committed
to you at this time.

11:08.291 --> 11:12.250
Okay, this is a conversation
that I never, ever wanted
to have,

11:12.250 --> 11:14.083
and it might seem like
I was angling to have it,

11:14.083 --> 11:16.792
but I really was not,
and it's making me
extremely stressed

11:16.792 --> 11:19.041
and a little angry for reasons
I don't understand,

11:19.041 --> 11:21.417
so I actually
have to go now.
Bye.

11:25.917 --> 11:28.500
Motherfuck.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.083
Blah!

11:33.792 --> 11:37.875
You see, this is why
I started my advocacy group
for the childless.

11:37.875 --> 11:41.583
I have the oldest granddaughter.
That's who gets the ring.
That's who gets the ring.

11:41.583 --> 11:43.667
- What, are you kidding?
That's medieval!
- No.

11:43.667 --> 11:45.917
Can we just table this
for a second and move on?

11:45.917 --> 11:48.291
Margo:
What is Hannah gonna do
with an engagement ring?

11:48.291 --> 11:52.625
She is going to wear it
on her fucking finger
when she gets engaged.

11:52.625 --> 11:54.959
- She's practically
engaged now.
- ( sighs )

11:54.959 --> 11:56.792
Rebecca doesn't
even have a boyfriend.

11:56.792 --> 11:59.458
- Oh, really? You--
- This is stupid.
Our mother is dying.

11:59.458 --> 12:01.583
This is dumb.

12:01.583 --> 12:02.625
Hey.

12:02.625 --> 12:05.708
Wow, don't you
look all fancy?

12:05.708 --> 12:08.291
Oh, thanks.
I'm just going out
with Rebecca.

12:08.291 --> 12:10.708
Uh, Rebecca's studying.
She can't.

12:10.708 --> 12:13.792
Well, she invited me,
so I don't know.

12:13.792 --> 12:16.166
( exhales )

12:16.166 --> 12:18.625
I just love that.

12:22.959 --> 12:24.458
Are you sure I can't
get you a drink?

12:24.458 --> 12:26.417
Yeah, I don't drink
on weeknights.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.458
Then why did you
want to go to a bar?

12:29.458 --> 12:33.667
Because I feel like a bar
is the right place to go
with a person like you.

12:33.667 --> 12:36.542
A person like me?

12:36.542 --> 12:39.458
Rebecca, I don't know
if you even know this,

12:39.458 --> 12:41.458
but you're
very rude to me.

12:41.458 --> 12:43.875
You have been ever since
we were little kids.

12:43.875 --> 12:46.875
You mean since you told me
the truth about my father?

12:46.875 --> 12:48.834
Oh, come on.
Do you really think

12:48.834 --> 12:50.959
you would've avoided
knowing otherwise?

12:50.959 --> 12:52.500
He insider traded, okay?

12:52.500 --> 12:54.083
It wasn't like
he sex trafficked.

12:54.083 --> 12:56.083
Okay, well, I--

12:58.959 --> 13:01.291
ugh, I don't have
very many friends.

13:01.291 --> 13:03.208
Well, I wish that
surprised me more.

13:03.208 --> 13:04.834
I'm sorry to hear that.

13:04.834 --> 13:06.500
It's actually okay.

13:06.500 --> 13:08.333
I don't really have
any time for friends.

13:08.333 --> 13:10.583
I have a boyfriend.
His name's Dane.

13:10.583 --> 13:13.041
- Hot name.
- Thanks.

13:13.041 --> 13:16.250
- Is he nice?
- Yeah, he's great.

13:16.250 --> 13:17.875
He only wants
to see each other
on Wednesdays,

13:17.875 --> 13:19.959
so I'm missing
our night this week.

13:19.959 --> 13:22.083
Well, what does he do
on the other nights?

13:22.083 --> 13:24.792
He has a different
girlfriend.

13:26.458 --> 13:28.333
Are you fucking serious,
Rebecca?

13:28.333 --> 13:31.166
- That's horrible.
- No, it actually
works really well.

13:31.166 --> 13:33.458
I mean, I don't
have a lot of time.

13:33.458 --> 13:35.583
Okay.

13:35.583 --> 13:38.083
Anyway, he's better
than my other boyfriend.

13:38.083 --> 13:41.875
Rick was a writer,
and he just, like, made
everything about himself,

13:41.875 --> 13:43.166
and he was exhausting
to be around,

13:43.166 --> 13:44.708
and it just made me
realize that writers

13:44.708 --> 13:47.166
are, like, this
ridiculous class
of people

13:47.166 --> 13:48.875
who just make everything
about themselves

13:48.875 --> 13:52.208
and they tend to have
really strange, bizarre
eating habits--

13:52.208 --> 13:55.208
Rebecca, if you
hate me so much,

13:55.208 --> 13:57.208
then why did you want
to hang out with me?

13:57.208 --> 14:00.917
I don't know.
I just thought
it would be fun.

14:00.917 --> 14:03.417
I would really like it
if we could be the kind
of cousins

14:03.417 --> 14:05.208
who, like,
spend time together

14:05.208 --> 14:07.041
and sleep in the same bed
in the summertime

14:07.041 --> 14:08.417
and, you know,
jump in a lake

14:08.417 --> 14:10.166
and have inside jokes
about our grandmother

14:10.166 --> 14:11.708
and were molested
by the same person,

14:11.708 --> 14:13.917
but we're not.
We do not get along.

14:13.917 --> 14:16.166
I really respect you,
but even Grandma says

14:16.166 --> 14:18.500
you don't have
a great sense of humor.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.083
Do you think
you're that funny?

14:20.083 --> 14:22.583
- You're not that funny.
- Well, that's crazy.

14:22.583 --> 14:25.250
I didn't even know
that your work was,
like, trying to be funny.

14:25.250 --> 14:27.375
That's because I sent you
the less funny pieces

14:27.375 --> 14:28.792
because I know
you're not funny

14:28.792 --> 14:30.917
so you wouldn't understand
my funnier stuff.

14:30.917 --> 14:32.750
Why would
I have to be funny
to understand them?

14:32.750 --> 14:34.917
I just knew
that if I sent you
my funny stuff,

14:34.917 --> 14:36.792
you'd be like,
"What is this, Martian?"

14:36.792 --> 14:38.291
You don't understand funny.

14:38.291 --> 14:41.208
Oh, okay, well,
Grandma also said
behind your back

14:41.208 --> 14:42.792
that she thought
you were loose.

14:42.792 --> 14:44.750
That's what
she said to me.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.041
I don't want to fight
with you, okay?

14:54.041 --> 14:55.792
- I respect you. I do.
- Oh, really?

14:55.792 --> 14:58.417
Is that why you made me
touch my chachi with you?

14:58.417 --> 14:59.875
Wait, what?

14:59.875 --> 15:03.542
When we were seven,
you made me sit in a room
and touch my chachi.

15:03.542 --> 15:05.208
Wait, does "chachi" mean
what I think it means?

15:05.208 --> 15:07.166
- Yes.
- 'Cause I never did that.

15:07.166 --> 15:09.083
You said you'd learned a cool
new trick and we should both

15:09.083 --> 15:11.583
lie under the covers
and touch ourselves for--

15:11.583 --> 15:13.708
- I never said that!
I never did that!
- Yes, you did!

15:13.708 --> 15:15.792
- Oh, my God,
I can't believe you.
- ( phone chimes )

15:15.792 --> 15:18.041
"Chachi"?

15:18.041 --> 15:20.417
Do not check your texts
while we drive.

15:20.417 --> 15:22.375
It's Mom.
Grandma has a fever.

15:22.375 --> 15:25.125
Well, we're almost there
so don't answer her.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.500
You're gonna be a doctor
and you don't know
how fucked up it is

15:27.500 --> 15:29.125
to check your texts
while we drive?

15:29.125 --> 15:31.250
Oh, my God,
I'm just texting my mom

15:31.250 --> 15:32.792
to tell her that
we are almost there.

15:32.792 --> 15:36.000
- Let me answer it for you.
- No, I don't want you
touching my phone!

15:36.000 --> 15:38.458
Oh, you don't want me
touching your phone with
my fucking chachi hands?

15:38.458 --> 15:39.959
- Is that the fucking problem?
- Yes, that's exactly right.

15:39.959 --> 15:42.333
- Yes, that is exactly right.
- There is chachi all over
my hands.

15:42.333 --> 15:44.500
Ew, get off of me.
You're disgusting.

15:44.500 --> 15:47.333
- Hannah: You're insane.
- ( both scream )

16:05.125 --> 16:07.625
- What did you do?
- How'd you get here so fast?

16:07.625 --> 16:10.667
I borrowed
Desi's motorcycle.
What happened?

16:12.208 --> 16:16.291
Okay, don't only text me
"car crash," okay?

16:16.291 --> 16:19.500
- Scared the shit out of me.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

16:21.959 --> 16:25.166
- Careful of my head.
- I've got some mother hens
following me.

16:25.166 --> 16:26.875
Loreen:
Oh, my baby.

16:26.875 --> 16:29.333
Holy shit.

16:32.208 --> 16:36.708
Holy fucking shit.
What the fuck happened?

16:36.708 --> 16:38.875
What the fuck
did you do?

16:38.875 --> 16:41.291
What did I do?
She was the one driving.

16:41.291 --> 16:42.875
- We're fine.
- Mm-hmm, we're fine.

16:42.875 --> 16:44.625
( whispers )
But you are fucking crazy.

16:44.625 --> 16:47.250
- How's Grandma?
- Her fever has spiked.

16:47.250 --> 16:49.750
She's resting,
but it's not good.

16:49.750 --> 16:53.583
Actually, I have
something to bring up
now regarding Mom...

16:53.583 --> 16:56.917
- What?
- ...which is if she
does slip into a coma,

16:56.917 --> 16:58.333
she has made it
very clear to me

16:58.333 --> 17:01.083
that she would like us
to let her go naturally.

17:01.083 --> 17:03.500
You mean unplug
her life support?

17:04.333 --> 17:05.583
Well, sweetheart,
to give her

17:05.583 --> 17:07.666
a different kind
of life support.

17:07.666 --> 17:11.165
The support to help her
end her life peacefully.

17:11.165 --> 17:13.708
Are you fucking
kidding me?

17:13.708 --> 17:14.916
No, I'm not kidding you.

17:14.916 --> 17:18.500
Is that why you didn't take
anything from the house?

17:18.500 --> 17:21.416
Because you knew soon enough
Mom would be dead

17:21.416 --> 17:23.000
and it would all be yours?

17:23.000 --> 17:25.375
Oh, my God,
that is a filthy

17:25.375 --> 17:27.125
- and ludicrous
thing to say.
- Is it?

17:27.125 --> 17:29.000
- Margo, shut up, please.
- Oh, you shut up.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.208
Loreen, you're not
fucking Switzerland.

17:31.208 --> 17:33.375
Tell us what
you really think.

17:33.375 --> 17:35.083
I think that
you both resent me

17:35.083 --> 17:37.792
because my life is in order
and my marriage is intact.

17:37.792 --> 17:40.583
Oh, I am deeply
in love with Joe

17:40.583 --> 17:41.959
and we do not need
a marriage license.

17:41.959 --> 17:44.250
Loreen:
Joe has a plate in his head,
and you can tell.

17:44.250 --> 17:46.708
No, you're right, Loreen.
We are eating ourselves
up inside

17:46.708 --> 17:49.083
because you nabbed
Tad Horvath.

17:49.083 --> 17:51.708
Tad Horvath, catch
of the fucking century.

17:51.708 --> 17:53.792
Body like a little gymnast,
brain like a toy poodle.

17:53.792 --> 17:55.333
Don't talk to me
about my husband.

17:55.333 --> 17:58.917
You think you'd be
with Gary if he wasn't
pulling in six figures?

17:58.917 --> 18:01.125
Why did Mom say
that Sissy gets
the fucking house?

18:01.125 --> 18:03.125
- What?
- Because you already
have a house.

18:03.125 --> 18:05.667
Oh, well, maybe you would, too,
if you would get a goddamn job.

18:05.667 --> 18:09.083
Our mother is upstairs
naked and dying.

18:09.083 --> 18:11.708
She is naked and dying!

18:11.708 --> 18:13.667
- Do you even know
what that looks like?
- Nurse: Please!

18:13.667 --> 18:16.625
- Sissy: I don't
want to kill Mommy!
- You have got to be quiet.

18:16.625 --> 18:19.166
- I'd love to be quiet.
Not an option with these two.
- Shut up, Margo.

18:19.166 --> 18:21.750
- You shut up, Loreen!
- No, you shut up.

18:21.750 --> 18:23.208
You both shut up!
Just shut up!

18:23.208 --> 18:24.500
Guys, please...

18:24.500 --> 18:26.667
- Nurse: You're leaving
the floor now.
- Mama's--

18:26.667 --> 18:30.166
Don't you dare.

18:31.333 --> 18:34.500
( sobbing )

18:45.708 --> 18:48.291
I am so sorry
you had to see that.

18:48.291 --> 18:51.291
No, it's like enchilada night
at my parents' house.

18:51.291 --> 18:53.041
( laughs )

18:55.166 --> 18:57.458
Let me go fix this.

19:00.834 --> 19:02.333
Hi.

19:02.333 --> 19:04.375
Hey.

19:05.583 --> 19:09.542
Well... I have to pee.

19:18.750 --> 19:20.959
That's my boyfriend.

19:20.959 --> 19:23.875
- He's nice.
- Thanks.

19:41.959 --> 19:43.583
Come on.

19:44.792 --> 19:47.959
- Grandma, Grandma.
- Hmm?

19:47.959 --> 19:49.542
- I thought we should go.
- No, she wants to meet you.

19:49.542 --> 19:51.917
She wants to meet you.
Grandma, Grandma, Grandma.

19:51.917 --> 19:53.583
Grandma, Grandma, Grandma.

19:53.583 --> 19:56.041
- Hannah.
- Hi.

19:56.041 --> 19:57.875
This is
my boyfriend, Adam.

19:57.875 --> 20:01.708
I'm not really up
to meeting anybody new.

20:01.708 --> 20:04.959
- Okay, nice to meet you!
- I'm not deaf.

20:04.959 --> 20:08.041
Oh, sorry.
I'm a-- a loud person.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.500
- Hannah?
- Mm-hmm?

20:09.500 --> 20:12.875
I really don't want to talk
to strangers right now.

20:12.875 --> 20:14.125
Okay, I just thought--

20:14.125 --> 20:15.458
Well, Hannah and I
are getting married.

20:15.458 --> 20:18.041
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:18.041 --> 20:20.458
- No, I'm--
- Next year.

20:20.458 --> 20:21.834
Well, that's nice.

20:21.834 --> 20:23.375
Yeah, we're pretty happy
about it.

20:23.375 --> 20:27.583
- We're excited to
finally lock it down.
- Mm-hmm, yep.

20:27.583 --> 20:29.375
Have you got a good job?

20:29.375 --> 20:32.291
- Yes, I'm an actor.
- He's an actor, Grandma.

20:32.291 --> 20:34.417
He's an actor on Broadway,
not just--

20:34.417 --> 20:37.125
Well, here's what
I have to say about
being married.

20:37.125 --> 20:38.125
Okay.

20:38.125 --> 20:40.667
Someday you will
look at him,

20:40.667 --> 20:44.792
hating him with every
fiber of your being,

20:44.792 --> 20:49.792
wishing that he would die
the most violent death possible.

20:50.792 --> 20:53.458
It will pass.

20:55.041 --> 20:57.291
Oh, Loreen.

20:57.291 --> 20:59.959
Hannah's getting married.

20:59.959 --> 21:02.792
But I won't be there.

21:04.542 --> 21:07.875
He finally did it.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.166
And we're happy.

21:09.166 --> 21:12.208
Hannah:
Old maid no more.

21:12.208 --> 21:14.750
Thank you both
so much.

21:14.750 --> 21:16.333
Oh, yeah, no sweat.
She's cool as shit.

21:16.333 --> 21:19.208
- Mm-hmm.
- She's a tough one.

21:19.208 --> 21:21.166
I'm just glad
she's not in any pain.

21:21.166 --> 21:23.708
Well, I'm glad
I got to meet her.

21:23.708 --> 21:25.834
I have to head back to the city.
I have rehearsal tomorrow.

21:25.834 --> 21:27.000
I have rehearsal
tomorrow.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.500
Oh, yeah,
congratulations.

21:29.500 --> 21:31.667
Oh, thanks, yeah.
Thanks.

21:31.667 --> 21:32.917
- Okay, bye.
- I love you.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.041
- Love you, too.
- ( kisses )

21:34.041 --> 21:36.375
- Oh, bye.
- Oh, uh...

21:36.375 --> 21:38.625
( laughs )
Break a leg.

21:38.625 --> 21:40.125
All right.

21:40.125 --> 21:42.959
- Text me when you
get home, okay?
- Yep!

21:44.750 --> 21:46.417
He's a good dude.

21:46.417 --> 21:49.291
I guess if Grandma lives,
we're gonna have
to get married.

21:49.291 --> 21:51.625
( both laughing )

21:51.625 --> 21:56.125
Yeah, keep the job,
not the guy, right?

21:56.125 --> 21:58.750
- Wait, what?
- You know.

21:58.750 --> 22:02.375
You're so special.

22:02.375 --> 22:05.208
You deserve
everything and more.

22:05.208 --> 22:07.917
He's really nice,
but...

22:07.917 --> 22:11.542
you know, stay open
to possibilities.

22:13.750 --> 22:15.250
Mom, how dare you
talk about something

22:15.250 --> 22:17.250
you know literally
nothing about.

22:17.250 --> 22:19.291
No, you're right.
I don't know him very well.

22:19.291 --> 22:22.166
- I see certain things.
- Mm-hmm.

22:22.166 --> 22:24.750
He's odd, he's angry.

22:24.750 --> 22:28.000
He's uncomfortable
in his own skin.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.750
He bounces around
from thing to thing.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.625
Again, you have no--

22:32.625 --> 22:35.083
Just-- no, no, no.
Let me talk.

22:35.083 --> 22:37.750
I don't want you
to spend your whole life

22:37.750 --> 22:39.959
socializing him
like he's a stray dog,

22:39.959 --> 22:42.291
making the world
a friendlier place for him.

22:42.291 --> 22:45.750
It's not easy being
married to an odd man.

22:45.750 --> 22:47.500
It isn't.

22:51.250 --> 22:53.917
Well...

22:53.917 --> 22:55.708
I don't know what to say.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.542
He just did something
very nice for you

22:57.542 --> 22:59.291
and you're being
very unkind.

22:59.291 --> 23:01.792
Sorry.

She beat her pneumonia.

24:00.834 --> 24:03.625
The doctor was very pleased
about this this morning.

24:03.625 --> 24:06.166
Mom, I am-- I don't
know what to say.

24:06.166 --> 24:07.750
It's a miracle.

24:07.750 --> 24:11.708
I ate one cheese sandwich
and I'd like another.

24:11.708 --> 24:14.708
- Yay!
- Stat, right?

24:14.708 --> 24:16.166
Cheese sandwich, stat.

24:16.166 --> 24:19.375
You know, we should have
an old-fashioned Easter
next year.

24:19.375 --> 24:22.375
I don't love Easter.
I don't like what
it stands for.

24:22.375 --> 24:25.667
But we have to be closer.
It's not right.

24:25.667 --> 24:27.333
We have to be.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.667
You know what, Sissy?
You're right.

24:29.667 --> 24:31.542
- Yeah. I can travel.
- You are.

24:31.542 --> 24:33.708
I mean, I barely
know your daughters,
for God's sake.

24:33.708 --> 24:35.542
And Rebecca's a very good
influence on Hannah.

24:35.542 --> 24:37.000
As long as
she doesn't drive.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.333
- ( mocking laugh )
- ( all laugh )

24:39.333 --> 24:40.834
( laughs )

24:40.834 --> 24:44.375
Oh, Hannah,
you don't look good.

24:45.875 --> 24:47.750
No, I'm fine.

24:47.750 --> 24:49.625
I mean, I'm just
so glad you're okay

24:49.625 --> 24:51.458
and that the doctors
were wrong.

24:51.458 --> 24:54.959
People aren't
always right.

24:54.959 --> 24:56.208
( laughs )

24:56.208 --> 24:59.417
No, people aren't
always right.

24:59.417 --> 25:01.917
Your hands
are so soft, Grandma.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.708
I don't know
what your secret is.

25:03.708 --> 25:06.417
( chuckles )
Hand lotion.

25:24.083 --> 25:26.583

25:27.834 --> 25:31.500
- Hey, Rebecca.
- Hannah, Grandma's dead.

25:32.583 --> 25:33.834
What?

25:33.834 --> 25:35.542
She had a heart attack
just now.

25:35.542 --> 25:38.083
- She's dead, Hannah.
- No, she's not.

25:38.083 --> 25:40.125
She ate two
cheese sandwiches.

25:40.125 --> 25:42.083
You have to come back
up here.

25:42.083 --> 25:44.667
I'm already off the train.
I'm back in the city.

25:44.667 --> 25:48.083
Well, get back on the train.
Everyone's on their way.
