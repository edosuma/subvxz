WEBVTT

00:06.923 --> 00:10.384
There was bakemono at funeral.

00:10.428 --> 00:12.386
You know bakemono?

00:15.474 --> 00:16.807
What do we do next?

00:16.851 --> 00:19.351
We can forget...
All of it.

00:24.567 --> 00:26.734
<i>400 bombers
swooped down at Pearl Harbor,</i>

00:26.777 --> 00:29.278
<i>causing widespread damage
and death.</i>

00:29.321 --> 00:32.448
You're a citizen, boy.
Fight for your country.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.914
I am not a spy.

00:40.916 --> 00:43.917
I am a simple fisherman.

00:43.919 --> 00:47.046
I love this country.

00:47.048 --> 00:49.506
I'm not a spy.

00:49.508 --> 00:51.425
I am a simple fisherman.

00:59.852 --> 01:02.311
I love this country.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.074

01:45.606 --> 01:47.397
This order
is bullshit, Marlon.

01:47.399 --> 01:49.149
Maybe it is,

01:49.151 --> 01:50.901
and maybe it ain't.

01:50.903 --> 01:52.778
Everyone has to be out
by nightfall either way.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.655
When can we come back?

01:54.657 --> 01:58.075
The island is
Naval property now.

01:58.077 --> 01:59.993
Also I have
to confiscate anything

01:59.995 --> 02:01.203
that might be spy equipment.

02:01.205 --> 02:03.247
Radios, flashlights,
cameras.

02:03.249 --> 02:06.250
Come on, Marl.

02:06.252 --> 02:09.461
We used to get plastered
together at Wada's.

02:09.463 --> 02:12.714
My mom washed your uniform
after you threw up on it.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.800
If I was a spy,
wouldn't you know it by now?

02:17.012 --> 02:20.180
You're lucky it's me.

02:20.182 --> 02:21.890
Some of these MPs

02:21.892 --> 02:24.643
would love to see you
have an accident.

02:24.645 --> 02:25.519
You know...

02:25.521 --> 02:28.939
like Stan Grichuk?

02:28.941 --> 02:30.524
Then it's a good thing
I'm not a drunk

02:30.526 --> 02:32.317
who just got fired
from his job.

02:41.745 --> 02:43.579
Do you at least know
where they took my dad?

02:45.749 --> 02:47.291
Wherever he is,
he's safer there.

03:01.265 --> 03:03.515
Yoshida-san!
We've got room.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.392
Ah, thank you.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.108
Can you
believe this?

03:13.110 --> 03:14.818
I'm starting to.

03:18.532 --> 03:21.200
Hey... maybe in I.A. you'll
get to see that Luz girl again.

03:24.079 --> 03:26.121
She's moved on.

03:26.123 --> 03:27.414
So have I.

03:27.416 --> 03:29.791
Water under the
Badger Avenue Bridge.

03:30.628 --> 03:33.045
Here, let me
get the rest.

03:35.674 --> 03:38.133
Okay, big man.

03:38.135 --> 03:39.593
Just the one
suitcase?

04:00.282 --> 04:02.032
Your father's.

04:16.048 --> 04:18.714
I did not think I would
like it here at first.

04:42.283 --> 04:43.532
Okay, everyone.

04:45.035 --> 04:46.555
Let's see what we can
find in the city.

06:39.358 --> 06:41.483
They still have
vacancies.

06:41.485 --> 06:42.901
Maybe we should get
separate rooms

06:42.903 --> 06:44.945
from Asako and Chester.

07:04.007 --> 07:05.298
No...

07:06.385 --> 07:07.385
No.

07:09.221 --> 07:10.303
No!

07:11.223 --> 07:12.223
No!

07:21.692 --> 07:23.483
Hey,
keep it movin'.

08:31.386 --> 08:33.178
Hey, gents, slow down.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.888
I can hardly keep up.

08:34.890 --> 08:37.807
Oh, you're here
on Wednesdays now?

08:37.808 --> 08:39.518
Ah, well, usually
I'm with Irv and Hitoshi,

08:39.520 --> 08:40.769
but they switched me.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.647
We not see them
for days.

08:43.649 --> 08:46.900
Well, then, I guess it's lucky
I'm on Wednesdays now.

09:27.985 --> 09:28.900
Chester.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.402
Did you drop out?

09:30.404 --> 09:31.319
I haven't
seen you since...

09:31.321 --> 09:32.321
Pearl Harbor?

09:32.990 --> 09:34.239
Yeah.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.199
I brought back
your enlarger.

09:36.201 --> 09:37.721
Oh, thanks. You didn't
have to do that.

09:39.413 --> 09:41.413
I was also wondering
what you thought of these.

09:41.415 --> 09:44.165
There's been a few funerals
on Terminal Island lately,

09:44.167 --> 09:45.584
and some more of
the pictures that I took

09:45.586 --> 09:46.459
turned out like this.

09:46.461 --> 09:48.253
What am I doing wrong?

09:48.255 --> 09:50.547
Well, if you ask
my old professor,

09:50.549 --> 09:52.048
he'd say it's a combination
of a slow shutter

09:52.050 --> 09:53.216
and a shaky hand.

09:53.218 --> 09:55.468
If you ask my Jewish mother,

09:55.470 --> 09:56.928
she'd say you've been
taking photos

09:56.930 --> 09:58.010
of things you shouldn't be.

09:58.849 --> 09:59.723
But I asked you.

09:59.725 --> 10:02.058
Well, I say

10:02.060 --> 10:04.436
a picture captures
a photographer's relationship

10:04.438 --> 10:05.770
to the world around him,

10:05.772 --> 10:08.732
and with everything that's
been going on right now,

10:08.734 --> 10:11.174
it's no surprise that yours are
coming out a little disturbed.

10:12.029 --> 10:14.237
It's a tough time,
Chester.

10:15.991 --> 10:17.073
I can only imagine
what this is like

10:17.075 --> 10:18.199
for you right now.

10:19.536 --> 10:20.535
Thank you, Professor.

10:20.537 --> 10:22.078
I appreciate it.

10:36.511 --> 10:37.844
Luz?

10:41.683 --> 10:43.016
Chester.

10:43.018 --> 10:44.809
Hey.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.144
It's good to see you.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.937
How have you been?

10:58.991 --> 11:00.784
So, when were you
going to tell me?

11:00.786 --> 11:02.535
Nine months from now?
Nine years?

11:02.537 --> 11:04.913
This is my mess.

11:04.915 --> 11:07.624
My mistake.

11:07.626 --> 11:09.959
I need to take care
of it myself.

11:09.961 --> 11:11.441
Then why didn't you
take the medicine?

11:14.257 --> 11:15.465
Because of my mom.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.177
Your mom? Isn't she...

11:19.179 --> 11:20.178
Yeah.

11:20.180 --> 11:23.056
From giving birth to me.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.809
She lost too much blood.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.104
The story
my <i> abuela</i> tells

11:29.106 --> 11:33.191
is that all she
had time to do was...

11:33.193 --> 11:34.901
name me,

11:34.903 --> 11:37.195
hold me,

11:37.197 --> 11:38.321
and say goodbye.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.200
Jesus.

11:43.245 --> 11:45.870
My mother died
so I could live.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.205
All my life,

11:47.207 --> 11:49.290
I've been trying to live up
to her sacrifice.

11:49.292 --> 11:51.376
I was going to be a nun,

11:51.378 --> 11:53.753
a nurse,

11:53.755 --> 11:55.088
a perfect daughter,

11:55.090 --> 11:57.048
and then
you come along,

11:57.050 --> 11:59.801
and I think, "Why do I
have to be perfect?"

12:02.514 --> 12:04.931
I should have known better.

12:07.310 --> 12:11.688
After my mother died,

12:11.690 --> 12:14.357
my <i> abuela</i> gave this to me.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.445
She says that this lets
my mother watch over me.

12:19.614 --> 12:22.115
Crazy, right?

12:24.244 --> 12:27.620
Just some old
<i>curanderismo</i> stuff.

12:29.624 --> 12:30.665
But I can't shake
the feeling

12:30.667 --> 12:32.167
that she is right.

12:32.169 --> 12:35.795
Nothing in this world
is an accident.

12:35.797 --> 12:39.132
There's always someone watching,

12:39.134 --> 12:41.718
judging,

12:41.720 --> 12:42.886
punishing.

12:46.516 --> 12:48.892
Does your
family know?

12:51.104 --> 12:54.939
Despite being
deeply Catholic,

12:54.941 --> 12:57.025
neither my father
or brother took the news

12:57.027 --> 12:58.902
with much mercy or grace.

13:00.989 --> 13:02.238
Then let me help.

13:03.742 --> 13:05.200
How?

13:06.286 --> 13:08.411
Do you have a job now?

13:08.413 --> 13:11.372
Do you have a decent place
for me to stay?

13:14.544 --> 13:16.586
Yeah.

13:18.799 --> 13:21.591
I'm working
at St. Jerome Orphanage.

13:22.886 --> 13:24.219
The baby's gonna
grow up there...

13:26.431 --> 13:28.890
until I can afford
to raise a child myself.

13:30.519 --> 13:33.269
You're putting our kid
in an orphanage?

13:33.271 --> 13:34.271
Chester...

13:35.398 --> 13:38.399
it's not romantic.

13:38.401 --> 13:40.360
It's not inspiring...

13:42.405 --> 13:45.114
but at least it's a plan.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.795
I'm not a spy.

13:58.797 --> 14:01.297
I'm a simple fisherman.

14:01.299 --> 14:03.883
I love this country.

14:03.885 --> 14:05.844
I'm not a spy.

14:05.846 --> 14:08.221
I am a simple fisherman.

14:11.560 --> 14:13.935
Nakayama, up.

14:16.398 --> 14:19.274
I am not a spy.

14:19.276 --> 14:22.235
I'm a simple fisherman.

14:22.237 --> 14:25.238
I love this country.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.491
I'm not a spy.

14:28.493 --> 14:30.535
I love this country.

14:30.537 --> 14:33.371
I'm not a spy.

14:41.756 --> 14:43.131
Let's go.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.789
I'm not a spy.

15:16.791 --> 15:18.750
Yeah? What's
the next part?

15:18.752 --> 15:20.668
I'm a simple fisherman.

15:20.670 --> 15:23.338
Who was probably
transporting fuel

15:23.340 --> 15:25.590
to the Emperor's
warships.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.759
Tell me, is that why
your boss was killed?

15:27.761 --> 15:29.886
Did he figure out
what you were up to?

15:29.888 --> 15:32.472
I don't know
why Mr. Grichuk died.

15:32.474 --> 15:33.598
Oh, right, right,
right, because...

15:33.600 --> 15:38.227
because you're just
a simple fisherman.

15:38.229 --> 15:40.188
Now prove it.

15:44.027 --> 15:46.361
I don't know how to ice fish.

15:46.363 --> 15:49.364
Well, then, it looks like
you'll need some luck.

17:16.036 --> 17:16.992
Yuko...

17:16.994 --> 17:18.411
the Japanese girl
who works here.

17:19.748 --> 17:21.455
Darling,

17:21.458 --> 17:22.999
I haven't had
a Japanese girl work for me

17:23.001 --> 17:24.416
in years.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.714
I swear she was here.

17:29.716 --> 17:32.008
She read my future,
in that room.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.013
I don't know
what you imagined you saw...

17:38.349 --> 17:40.725
but there is
no Yuko here.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.853
Hey.
Buy another drink.

17:43.855 --> 17:46.522
Be safe
when you leave, hon.

17:46.524 --> 17:48.691
I have client
to look after.

17:48.693 --> 17:50.151
All right?

17:51.196 --> 17:53.946
Thank you.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.520
Nakayama...

18:58.388 --> 18:59.428
<i>Konnichiwa.</i>

18:59.430 --> 19:00.847
Do you speak
English?

19:00.849 --> 19:01.849
How much?

19:17.115 --> 19:18.239
Ma?

19:18.241 --> 19:19.490
We can take
two suitcases.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.159
Only two.

19:21.161 --> 19:22.910
What do we pack?

19:22.912 --> 19:24.662
Will it be cold?

19:24.664 --> 19:25.788
They tell us nothing.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.046
It's going to be okay.

19:36.384 --> 19:38.217
We have 48 hours.

19:38.219 --> 19:40.761
We can pack up clothes
and other essentials,

19:40.763 --> 19:42.763
then we should sell off
everything else.

19:42.765 --> 19:44.182
Who knows what's at the track?

19:44.184 --> 19:45.516
It won't hurt
to have extra cash.

19:45.518 --> 19:46.934
And your father's car?

19:46.936 --> 19:50.313
I can ask my photography
professor to hold onto it.

19:53.568 --> 19:55.568
We're going to be fine.

20:05.955 --> 20:08.372
He'd probably say
it's about time.

20:11.169 --> 20:12.710
Does it hurt?

20:16.382 --> 20:18.090
Let's see.

20:19.677 --> 20:22.136
Doctors say

20:22.138 --> 20:23.846
that if you pinch really hard

20:23.848 --> 20:26.182
on the inside of the arm,

20:26.184 --> 20:28.184
it can hurt enough
to distract you

20:28.186 --> 20:29.310
from the pain on your knee.

20:29.312 --> 20:31.646
Ready?

20:31.648 --> 20:32.688
I guess so.

20:34.317 --> 20:36.484
Okay.

20:36.486 --> 20:38.653
Close your eyes,

20:38.655 --> 20:39.695
'cause this is gonna hurt.

20:43.493 --> 20:45.201
Ow!

20:45.203 --> 20:46.619
Ow!

20:46.621 --> 20:49.789
Ow...

20:51.167 --> 20:52.458
Feeling better?

20:52.460 --> 20:53.376
Yeah?

20:53.378 --> 20:55.544
Okay, go on.

20:55.546 --> 20:57.129
Be careful, okay?

21:09.435 --> 21:11.769
Miss Luz!
Miss Luz!

21:14.691 --> 21:16.607
This one's
Miyagawa, right?

21:16.609 --> 21:18.651
Her name is Alice.
Where are you taking her?

21:18.653 --> 21:20.486
Hey, Max? Tomoko?

21:20.488 --> 21:21.362
Everything's
gonna be all right...

21:21.364 --> 21:23.197
You got
a Saito, a Suzuki,

21:23.199 --> 21:25.324
a Watanabe,
and two Yamamotos.

21:25.326 --> 21:26.284
They're coming with us.

21:26.286 --> 21:28.160
The Yamamotos are babies.

21:28.162 --> 21:29.412
It's for security.

21:29.414 --> 21:30.414
Whose?

21:31.457 --> 21:33.457
Who are these children
a threat to?

21:37.422 --> 21:39.046
Alice, listen to me.

21:39.048 --> 21:40.256
You're gonna be okay.

21:40.258 --> 21:42.049
They're not going to hurt you.

21:42.051 --> 21:44.302
These people
are on our side...

21:44.304 --> 21:46.178
Hey, can you be careful, please?

21:49.684 --> 21:51.183
It's gonna be okay.

21:51.185 --> 21:52.977
Everything's
gonna be okay, guys.

21:55.898 --> 21:57.732
What about the unborn?

21:57.734 --> 21:59.108
Excuse me?

21:59.110 --> 22:01.444
If a child's born
during the war,

22:01.446 --> 22:02.446
what happens to it?

22:04.615 --> 22:08.326
Anyone with even one drop
of Jap blood's gotta go.

22:08.328 --> 22:09.648
Take it up with
Colonel Bendetsen.

22:39.734 --> 22:41.150
Hey.

22:41.152 --> 22:42.276
Where are these
children's parents?

22:42.278 --> 22:43.235
They don't have any.

22:43.237 --> 22:44.653
They're from
St. Jerome.

22:44.655 --> 22:46.280
Every Jap
has to report.

22:46.282 --> 22:48.074
We mean it.

22:57.377 --> 22:58.709
Ma...

22:58.711 --> 23:00.252
this may not be
the best time

23:00.254 --> 23:01.712
to tell you this,

23:01.714 --> 23:04.006
but I've been going
with someone.

23:04.008 --> 23:05.424
Her name is Luz Ojeda.

23:05.426 --> 23:06.426
Her family's from Mexico.

23:07.553 --> 23:10.221
Ma, look at me.

23:11.307 --> 23:12.307
Luz is pregnant.

23:13.518 --> 23:16.602
She's going
to have my baby.

23:19.774 --> 23:21.315
Why do you tell me now?

23:21.317 --> 23:24.443
Because I can't
go in there with you.

23:24.445 --> 23:27.154
I can't abandon Luz
or the baby.

23:27.156 --> 23:28.239
I have to help them.

23:28.241 --> 23:31.117
Me and <i> Otosan</i>
are your family.

23:31.119 --> 23:32.451
It is a government order.

23:32.453 --> 23:33.619
Look, I messed up.

23:33.621 --> 23:35.121
I should have told
you and Pop earlier.

23:35.123 --> 23:36.455
I shouldn't have gone
sneaking around,

23:36.457 --> 23:39.041
hoping things would just
work out on their own.

23:39.043 --> 23:40.459
That's why I have to go now.

23:47.385 --> 23:48.385
Come, Toshiro.

23:49.345 --> 23:50.845
We must not behave

23:50.847 --> 23:54.306
as if the world is meant
to spin around us.

24:12.827 --> 24:14.160
Excuse me,

24:14.162 --> 24:15.494
where do we stay?

24:15.496 --> 24:16.871
What's
your numbers?

24:16.873 --> 24:19.123
742 and 740.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.625
700s that way.

25:05.171 --> 25:07.755
It stinks.

25:07.757 --> 25:10.549
Then we have work to do.

25:18.643 --> 25:20.184
Hey.

25:20.186 --> 25:21.602
I'm sorry
to barge in.

25:21.604 --> 25:22.603
Chester...

25:22.605 --> 25:24.480
What are you doing here?

25:24.482 --> 25:27.233
Are you okay?

25:27.235 --> 25:28.817
Soldiers were here.

25:28.819 --> 25:30.694
They rounded up
all the Japanese kids.

25:30.696 --> 25:32.196
I know.
That's why I came.

25:32.198 --> 25:34.532
They said just one drop
of Japanese blood, and...

25:37.036 --> 25:39.662
I don't know
what to do.

25:39.664 --> 25:40.829
You're living here?

25:40.831 --> 25:41.956
I told you,

25:41.958 --> 25:43.832
my father didn't
take the news well.

25:43.834 --> 25:45.501
You can't stay here.

25:45.503 --> 25:47.169
If the soldiers come back
after the baby's born,

25:47.171 --> 25:48.128
they'll take it away.

25:48.130 --> 25:48.963
We need to get you
out of state

25:48.965 --> 25:49.922
as soon as we can.

25:49.924 --> 25:51.549
Thanks for the concern,
Chester,

25:51.551 --> 25:53.592
but now's not the time
for a romantic gesture, okay?

25:53.594 --> 25:54.843
It's not
meant to be.

25:54.845 --> 25:56.178
I'm trying to save this baby,

25:56.180 --> 25:57.860
which, whether
you like it or not, is ours.

25:58.641 --> 25:59.890
I have
my father's car

25:59.892 --> 26:01.058
and plenty
of fuel rations,

26:01.060 --> 26:02.810
and I've already
called my professor.

26:02.812 --> 26:04.353
We figured out
the best route out of state.

26:04.355 --> 26:07.314
They're taking
babies, Luz.

26:07.316 --> 26:09.358
We gotta do something.

26:15.116 --> 26:16.782
Toshiro,
can you take this out?

27:25.186 --> 27:26.186
Hey, there you are.

27:27.480 --> 27:28.771
Sorry about that.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.862
Come on, Toshiro.

27:52.838 --> 27:54.963
<i>Her face.</i>

27:54.965 --> 27:56.131
<i>It's all I see.</i>

27:58.344 --> 28:00.636
She looks at me,

28:00.638 --> 28:02.721
expecting something,

28:02.723 --> 28:04.473
wanting something.

28:04.475 --> 28:05.849
Who, "she"?

28:05.851 --> 28:07.184
How should I know?

28:07.186 --> 28:09.645
Some woman on the street.

28:09.647 --> 28:11.063
When do we go back in?

28:11.065 --> 28:13.232
When we have
enough firewood.

28:13.234 --> 28:14.692
This woman.

28:14.694 --> 28:16.694
She speak?

28:16.696 --> 28:20.572
Tell her
Nikku Okada here.

28:20.574 --> 28:24.076
Ask her
what he want.

28:24.078 --> 28:25.285
Nick Okada?

28:25.287 --> 28:28.205
That young <i> ainoko</i>
at our table.

28:28.207 --> 28:31.709
Yamato-san imagines him
to be an <i> obake</i> or <i> yurei.</i>

28:31.711 --> 28:33.585
Each man
Nikku Okada touch

28:33.587 --> 28:36.046
disappear.

28:36.048 --> 28:39.591
Maybe we next.

28:39.593 --> 28:42.219
Something has
followed us.

28:42.221 --> 28:44.221
Perhaps someone
has been out of line,

28:44.223 --> 28:45.764
rousing up trouble.

28:45.766 --> 28:47.433
It couldn't be you,
could it?

28:48.644 --> 28:52.229
Cold making us
superstitious old women.

28:52.231 --> 28:53.231
Let's go back inside.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.263
You made it.

29:26.265 --> 29:27.514
Thank you for this,
Professor Henkoff.

29:27.516 --> 29:29.475
Aw, Phil.
No need for honorifics.

29:29.477 --> 29:30.477
Let's get you inside.

29:33.647 --> 29:35.439
You two can stay
in my guest room.

29:37.067 --> 29:38.817
It'll take a few days for
the chaos to die down,

29:38.819 --> 29:39.651
and you can move on.

29:39.653 --> 29:40.986
Thank you.

29:40.988 --> 29:43.071
We need to find someplace
where I can find work,

29:43.073 --> 29:44.198
and where Luz can get
medical care.

29:44.200 --> 29:45.783
What kind of work?

29:45.785 --> 29:46.575
Doesn't matter.

29:46.577 --> 29:48.160
Mechanical, factory,

29:48.162 --> 29:49.745
whatever pays
the bills.

29:49.747 --> 29:51.163
Maybe in New Mexico?

29:51.165 --> 29:52.790
I do have
some fellow travelers

29:52.792 --> 29:54.500
who live outside of Santa Fe.

29:54.502 --> 29:56.168
Let me
give them a call.

30:11.060 --> 30:12.518
I guess you do have a plan.

30:15.105 --> 30:17.356
Or at least your professor does.

30:26.408 --> 30:28.158
I'll sleep
on the floor.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.160
Yeah.

30:29.662 --> 30:31.203
Thanks.

30:32.456 --> 30:34.998
The bed's probably too small
for the both of us anyway,

30:35.000 --> 30:36.375
right?

30:39.088 --> 30:40.629
Yeah.

30:41.340 --> 30:42.464
Sir, step aside,

30:42.466 --> 30:43.590
or I will
have you restrained.

30:43.592 --> 30:45.926
Sit down, and keep
your stomach covered.

30:50.140 --> 30:51.140
What's your name, son?

30:54.562 --> 30:56.186
We got a tip a Japanese man

30:56.188 --> 30:58.230
was evading the federal
order to evacuate.

30:58.232 --> 30:59.439
You need to come with us.

30:59.441 --> 31:00.399
Chester...

31:00.401 --> 31:02.192
Don't stand up.

31:02.194 --> 31:04.820
Who's this?

31:04.822 --> 31:06.530
My girl.

31:06.532 --> 31:07.406
Don't worry,
we're not married.

31:07.408 --> 31:09.950
No laws are broken.

31:09.952 --> 31:11.159
It's okay, ma'am.

31:11.161 --> 31:14.872
It's the Japanese
we're concerned about.

31:27.845 --> 31:28.760
Wait, please!

31:28.762 --> 31:29.928
Please wait!

31:29.930 --> 31:31.513
Luz, get
back inside!

31:31.515 --> 31:32.723
I'm coming with you.

31:32.725 --> 31:33.765
We told you.

31:33.767 --> 31:35.601
We're only concerned
about the Japanese.

31:35.603 --> 31:37.203
Well, that's why
you need to take me too.

31:39.231 --> 31:41.273
I'm carrying one.

32:08.427 --> 32:10.052
Ma...

32:11.180 --> 32:12.763
Chester.

32:12.765 --> 32:14.389
You changed your mind?

32:14.391 --> 32:16.642
The FBI kind of
changed it for me.

32:21.774 --> 32:24.191
This is Luz.

32:24.193 --> 32:26.818
Luz, this is
my mother.

32:31.241 --> 32:34.618
I apologize for the mess.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.912
I wish we had a proper home
to welcome you to.

32:52.680 --> 32:54.346
Fellas, over here.

32:58.185 --> 32:59.768
This time,
catch enough for us too.

32:59.770 --> 33:01.144
You're not
the only ones

33:01.146 --> 33:03.855
who are sick of
bread and paste.

33:10.447 --> 33:12.864
Nick Okada?

33:12.866 --> 33:14.032
I hope I don't bring
bad luck.

33:25.671 --> 33:27.921
Nikku...

33:27.923 --> 33:30.632
you believe
in <i> bakemono?</i>

33:30.634 --> 33:31.633
<i>Bakemono?</i>

33:31.635 --> 33:34.678
Shape-shifting spirits.

33:34.680 --> 33:35.762
Yeah, I know, I know.

33:35.764 --> 33:36.964
My grandmother believed in it.

33:37.891 --> 33:40.517
Is there a <i> bakemono</i> among us?

33:41.729 --> 33:42.936
Doing what?

33:42.938 --> 33:44.771
Make men like Imamura

33:44.773 --> 33:47.733
and Nakamura
disappear.

33:47.735 --> 33:48.859
Don't be
ridiculous.

33:48.861 --> 33:50.736
There's no such thing
as <i> bakemono.</i>

33:51.780 --> 33:53.196
Whoa! Hey!

33:56.035 --> 33:57.534
That exactly

33:57.536 --> 33:59.453
what <i> bakemono</i> maybe say.

33:59.455 --> 34:01.663
Hey, wait! Please!

34:01.665 --> 34:02.914
What the hell
are you doing?

34:02.916 --> 34:03.999
Why are you here?

34:04.001 --> 34:05.125
Same as you.

34:05.127 --> 34:06.251
I have to be here.

34:06.253 --> 34:07.169
What happened to Imamura?

34:07.171 --> 34:08.503
I don't know!

34:08.505 --> 34:09.463
What kind of spirit are you?

34:09.465 --> 34:10.880
Goddamn it,
I'm not a spirit!

34:10.882 --> 34:11.757
Stop!

34:11.759 --> 34:13.925
Please! Please!

34:13.927 --> 34:15.010
You old idiots
are going to kill me!

34:15.012 --> 34:16.012
Admit what you are.

34:17.556 --> 34:18.556
Okay.

34:21.226 --> 34:22.601
I'm not a <i> bakemono.</i>

34:26.148 --> 34:27.522
I'm working for the DOJ.

34:27.524 --> 34:29.900
Justice Department.

34:29.902 --> 34:31.234
I was hired
to find spies,

34:31.235 --> 34:32.069
enemies of the state,

34:32.071 --> 34:33.487
but I couldn't find any.

34:33.489 --> 34:36.489
So you fed them names
so you could keep this job?

34:36.492 --> 34:39.367
Names of loyal men?

34:39.369 --> 34:42.996
You're a traitor
to your own people,

34:42.998 --> 34:44.081
to your country.

34:44.083 --> 34:46.123
Stop. Please!

34:49.797 --> 34:53.172
It is not
our decision to make.

34:53.175 --> 34:57.260
It is for the spirits
that inhabit this land,

34:57.262 --> 34:58.762
wherever we are.

34:58.764 --> 34:59.721
North Dakota.

34:59.723 --> 35:01.723
We're in North Dakota.

35:01.725 --> 35:03.642
Then I hope the spirits
of North Dakota

35:03.644 --> 35:05.977
treat you more kindly
than you've treated us.

35:14.947 --> 35:16.571
Hey...

35:17.699 --> 35:19.407
Hey, wait.

35:20.494 --> 35:21.494
Come back, please.

35:22.287 --> 35:24.121
Please, come...
please, come back.

35:24.123 --> 35:27.332
Help me, please.

35:27.334 --> 35:30.460
<i>Tasukete!</i>

35:30.462 --> 35:32.170
Help me!

35:34.550 --> 35:35.841
I can't move!

35:38.470 --> 35:40.887
You brought her here?

35:40.889 --> 35:42.639
She brought herself.

35:42.641 --> 35:44.349
Her family's
disowned her.

35:44.351 --> 35:45.631
At least with us
she's not alone.

36:04.163 --> 36:06.663
You ever get the feeling
you're being watched?

36:08.250 --> 36:09.332
Yeah.

36:09.334 --> 36:11.418
All the time.

36:11.420 --> 36:13.086
I'm a Japanese guy

36:13.088 --> 36:15.088
in the middle of a war
with Japan.

36:41.366 --> 36:43.200
Chester!

36:43.202 --> 36:44.618
Chester!

36:44.620 --> 36:46.786
Chester, you have to go!

36:47.831 --> 36:49.039
Yoshida-san!

36:51.627 --> 36:52.918
Are you okay?

36:59.509 --> 37:00.509
Dad, what
are you doing?

37:20.614 --> 37:21.947
- Watch it!
- Hey! Hey!

37:21.949 --> 37:23.573
Oh, shit!

37:23.575 --> 37:25.116
Drop the weapon!

37:25.118 --> 37:26.118
Dad, do what they say.

37:27.496 --> 37:28.787
Drop the weapon!

37:28.789 --> 37:29.913
Dad, don't do this!

37:29.915 --> 37:30.872
Oh, god!

37:30.874 --> 37:31.998
Don't shoot him!

37:32.000 --> 37:33.458
This is your last warning!

37:33.460 --> 37:34.584
Dad!

37:34.586 --> 37:36.294
Don't shoot him!

37:36.296 --> 37:38.797
Put the gun down!

37:40.884 --> 37:42.300
...Dad!

37:43.512 --> 37:45.095
- Dad!
- Back up!

37:46.265 --> 37:48.974
Oh, my God...
Dad!

37:48.976 --> 37:49.976
<i>Tosan!</i>
Oh, my god!

37:50.811 --> 37:52.602
Go.

37:52.604 --> 37:53.604
<i>Tosan?</i>

37:56.191 --> 37:57.399
Dad?

37:57.401 --> 37:59.901
...Nobody move!

38:15.711 --> 38:18.003
I don't understand.

38:18.005 --> 38:20.130
Why would he do that?

38:20.132 --> 38:22.841
I don't know.

38:22.843 --> 38:25.927
I've known Yoshida-san
my whole life.

38:25.929 --> 38:29.097
That was
nothing like him.

38:40.652 --> 38:42.736
Amy...

38:42.738 --> 38:44.195
you need anything?

38:53.540 --> 38:55.498
I don't know
what to say.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.042
I'm so sorry.

39:07.721 --> 39:09.137
It's okay.

39:09.139 --> 39:10.305
Please,
let me help.

39:10.307 --> 39:11.848
I can find a funeral home...

39:11.850 --> 39:13.475
What did
my father see?

39:13.477 --> 39:15.393
Why was he saying
that you had to leave?

39:17.314 --> 39:19.022
I don't know.

39:30.202 --> 39:32.410
What?

39:32.412 --> 39:34.412
What evil?

39:38.126 --> 39:40.293
I'm sorry, Chester.

39:40.295 --> 39:41.086
Just...

39:41.088 --> 39:42.754
Just go.

40:22.921 --> 40:24.212
Two bags!

40:34.391 --> 40:36.224
Two suitcases
per person.

40:36.226 --> 40:38.435
These are my father's.

40:38.437 --> 40:39.477
You killed him.

40:39.479 --> 40:41.771
Two per person.

40:42.305 --> 40:48.217
