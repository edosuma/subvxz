I'm outta here.

03:40.660 --> 03:43.660
[Narrator] I'm gonna tell you what
it's really like livin' in the hood.

03:43.560 --> 03:48.560
I moved back into my father's
house after livin' with my moms
for most of my life.

03:48.260 --> 03:52.260
Tray, I don't want you
hangin' out in the streets.

03:52.260 --> 03:54.560
I want you to finish school,

03:54.560 --> 03:59.160
'cause without an education the only
work you're gonna get is sellin' drugs,

03:59.060 --> 04:03.760
pimpin' women or workin'
security for Eddie Murphy.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.660
Now, I've done all I can.

04:05.660 --> 04:09.460
I got my education;
I worked two jobs to support you.

04:09.360 --> 04:13.060
But I can't teach you
how to be a man.

04:12.860 --> 04:15.660
Only your father
can do that.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.660
Now gimme a kiss
and be a good boy.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.460
- I love you, Tray. [Blows At Leaf]
- Love you too, Mom.

04:26.160 --> 04:28.160
So, will I see you again?

04:28.160 --> 04:30.260
Sorry, baby.

04:30.260 --> 04:33.660
You know there ain't no positive
black females in these movies.

[Kid On Bike Screams]

04:37.760 --> 04:39.760
- Sorry.
- [Moans]

04:42.960 --> 04:45.560
[Tray Narrating] My father tried
his best to give me advice.

04:45.460 --> 04:48.460
The problem was, he was only
a couple of years older than me.

04:48.360 --> 04:51.560
[Man] Fool, I told you I don't
want no damn Watchtower!

04:51.560 --> 04:53.460

- Look at you, man!
Look, you got big, man!
- Oh, you know.

05:03.460 --> 05:05.360
Last time I seen you,
you was about this tall.

05:05.360 --> 05:08.660
They wouldn't even let you on
the rides at the amusement park.
Had to take you to kiddie land.

05:08.460 --> 05:10.460
- Remember that?
- Yeah, but it's all good.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.460
- I was just about to eat
breakfast. You hungry?
- No, I'm full, man.

05:13.360 --> 05:16.560

Make yourself at home.
Hey, are those your Bo's?

05:22.960 --> 05:25.360
- Yeah.
- Hey, I'm gonna be sportin' them, man.

05:25.360 --> 05:28.060
It's good to have you
up in it too.

05:28.060 --> 05:31.960
- I'm gonna finish gettin' my
swollen on right. Have a seat.
- All right. Cool.

05:31.860 --> 05:36.160
Hey! Make sure your
ass is on that plastic.

05:36.160 --> 05:38.160
Look, Tray.
So we're not bumpin' heads.

05:38.160 --> 05:40.760
Man, if you gon' be stayin' here,
you gon' have to follow some rules.

05:40.760 --> 05:44.260
No smokin' my shit.
Don't let me catch you drinkin' my shit.

05:44.160 --> 05:49.660
And if you bring any of them ho's up
in here, make sure I fuck 'em first.

05:49.560 --> 05:53.360
And, uh... you gon'
have some chores.

05:53.260 --> 05:55.360
- Chores?
- That's right. Chores.

05:55.360 --> 05:57.560
Nigger, this ain't gon'
be no free ride!

05:57.560 --> 05:59.560
Uh, you gon' have to
keep track of my Matchbox cars.

05:59.560 --> 06:02.160
You got to organize the damn
Sega Genesis cartridges.

06:02.160 --> 06:06.060
Do my homework, since you want
to be such a smart ass.

06:05.960 --> 06:08.260
After that, in the nighttime,
cut the hair on my balls.

06:08.260 --> 06:10.960
- Can I ask you a question, Pop?
- Yeah.

06:10.860 --> 06:13.160
What you gon' be doin'?

06:13.060 --> 06:17.260
Hey! Look, nigger, I ain't got
to do nothin'. My mama take care of me.

06:17.060 --> 06:20.660
-[Sighs]
-I know you think I'm bein' hard on you.

06:20.660 --> 06:23.560
What the hell. I guess I'm tryin'
to teach you some responsibility.

06:23.560 --> 06:26.060
- You right, Pop.
- No shit.

06:25.960 --> 06:28.860
Hey, could you do me a favor?
Could you line me up in the back?

06:28.860 --> 06:31.260
That's gon' run you
about $13.

06:31.260 --> 06:35.060
Thirteen dollars?
Come on, man. The Spanish dude
down the block only charges six.

06:35.060 --> 06:41.060
- Well, take your ass to him
and let him fuck your head up.
- Nah, I'll let you cut me up.

06:40.860 --> 06:43.760
Hey, Tray, let me
ask you a question, man.

06:43.660 --> 06:45.660
- What's up?
- You still a virgin?

06:45.560 --> 06:47.560
Of course.

06:47.460 --> 06:53.360
Well, there was this one dude
who rubbed up against my butt
one time, but I ain't like it.

06:53.260 --> 06:56.560
Hey, man, I'm talkin'
about girls, man!

06:56.560 --> 06:59.960
Oh! Girls? C'mon, Pops.
Now, you know I be gettin' mine.

- Mmm. I mean, you gettin' it,
or you gettin' it?
- I'm gettin' it.

07:03.360 --> 07:07.260
- I didn't tell you about
that little honey dip?
- Uh-uh. What honey?

07:07.160 --> 07:09.660
- [Razor Buzzing]
- Oh, Pop, I met the finest
little brown-skinned cutie...

07:09.660 --> 07:11.660
down at
the corner market, man.

07:11.560 --> 07:15.460
She had big breasts
and big legs. Ass was-- Pow!

07:15.360 --> 07:17.660
- Ghetto booty! Yes.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

07:17.660 --> 07:20.560
So, you know, I knew she liked me,
'cause we locked eyes.

07:20.560 --> 07:23.460
- Mm-hmm.
- So I started to get into
my mack daddy Denzel mode.

07:23.460 --> 07:28.260
You know? Yeah. So I start fixin' my
eyebrows, make sure they was straight.

07:28.160 --> 07:31.060
Fix my hair, make sure
it was slick and greasy.

07:31.060 --> 07:34.460

07:34.360 --> 07:36.660

- Oh. Okay. So anyway...

07:36.560 --> 07:39.960
I went over to her house
one Sunday mornin'.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.360
Her moms had
just gone to church.

07:45.960 --> 07:49.160
And we had the place
all to ourself.

07:49.060 --> 07:52.760
So you know, we got to kissin',
lickin', slobbin'.

07:52.660 --> 07:56.260
You know, doin' the wild thing.
[Laughs]

07:58.360 --> 08:01.260
- When we got up there,
it was like heaven.
- [Moans]

08:01.260 --> 08:03.560
Better than
my wildest fantasies.

08:05.260 --> 08:08.660
Well, apparently, her moms must have
forgot her purse or somethin',

08:08.560 --> 08:10.760
- [Sniffing]
- 'cause she came back home.

08:10.760 --> 08:14.760
-I guess she could smell sex in the air.
-[Sniffing Continues]

08:14.560 --> 08:17.360
I got a surprise for you.

08:17.360 --> 08:19.760
- And that's when things
really got freaky.
- Come on.

08:19.760 --> 08:22.360
-Before I knew it the door burst open...
-Huh?

08:22.360 --> 08:24.260
and there was her mama!

08:24.260 --> 08:28.360
Ohh! Hold him down, baby.
Let Mama have him.

08:28.260 --> 08:31.260
- I grabbed my things and got out
of there the best way I could.
- [Girl Groans]

08:31.160 --> 08:34.559
Yeah. Hmm. I sure do hope
you got her number.

08:34.460 --> 08:38.159
- The girl?
- Hell, no. Her mama. She the freak.

08:37.960 --> 08:40.159
Hey, hey. Pops, don't go up
too high in the back.

08:40.159 --> 08:44.059
Man, don't worry about this.
We all done. There we go.

08:44.059 --> 08:46.760
- Yeah.
- I got something for you
to make the girls...

08:46.760 --> 08:49.460

[Tray Narrating]
It hurt me to wake up and see
my beautiful black people suffer,

09:42.860 --> 09:47.460
victimized by the oppressive,
harsh realities of the hood.

09:47.360 --> 09:50.860
I guess, even though we were free,
we were still slaves...

09:50.760 --> 09:53.160
in the mind.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.060
Message.

09:56.960 --> 09:59.260
Luckily, I wasn't alone
here in the hood.

09:59.260 --> 10:02.360
See, my cousin Loc Dog
lived right across the street.

10:02.260 --> 10:05.560
Loc Dog was America's
worst nightmare.

generations of hopelessness,

10:08.960 --> 10:11.360

of another race!

Look, Dashiki,
I'm sorry about last night.

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:59.960
I thought about it and
I want to be a father to my child.

01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:03.760
And another thing.

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:09.760
I also realized
how much I love you.

01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:11.560
And I wanna leave the hood
with you.

01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:18.360

I just wanted them to come
say good-bye to their daddies.

came to see me, man?

Mm-mmm. Come on, girl.
Ain't gonna hurt you.

- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:18.160
It's just that when I drink,
sometimes I get a little crazy.

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:22.760

See, I don't want you to think
I'm a freak or nothin' like that,

01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:32.660
because I usually don't even go home
with guys when I first meet 'em.

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:36.660
But I just feel
so comfortable with you.

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:39.160
Hey, and that's good, girl.

You're in good hands now, girl. Loc

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:08.160
You sure... it's okay?

Mm-hmm.

I told you I could
get a little crazy.

01:22:06.460 --> 01:22:08.860
# With more gain than beggars
on trains livin' sharp pain #

01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:11.360
# Poisonous rebel like Deck
You can't destroy this #

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:13.360
# You'll get ambushed
Skate, try to avoid this #

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:15.760
# The side effects
of hot raps and hot tracks #

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:18.060
# A duffle bag full of guns
Guns dipped in black #

01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:20.560
# My coacha glides and
attacks you like a vulture #

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:22.760
# Ghostface in Madison Square
is on your poster #

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:24.760
# Yes, this shit is raw
Comin' at your door #

01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:27.560
# You start to scream out loud
Wu-Tang's back for more #

01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:29.760
# Yes, the hour's 4:00
I told you before #

01:22:29.660 --> 01:22:31.860
# Prepare for Mike Fight
and Buster Cold War #

01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:34.760
# Be on the lookout for this
mass-murderous suspect #

01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:37.260
# That fills more body bags
than 'partments and projects #

01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:39.060
# And as far as
the coroners know #

01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:41.760
# The autopsy show
it was a Shaolin blow #

01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:44.660
# Put on by my family
Brought to the academy of the Wu #

01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:47.060
# And learnt how to
fuck up your anatomy #

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:49.660
# Steadily calm and deadly
splatter head lyrics #

01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:50.960
# I lick through your transmit #

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:52.460
# MC's, submit to the will #

01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:55.860
# As I kill your juvenile freestyle
Civilize the mental #

01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:57.560
# Devils worship this
like an icon #

01:22:57.660 --> 01:23:00.460
# Bear-huggin' mics
with the grips of a python #

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:02.660
# Yes, this shit is raw
Comin' at your door #

01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:05.060
# Start to scream out loud
Wu-Tang's back for more #

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:08.460
# You heard other raps before
But kept waitin' for the Son of Song #

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:09.960
# I keep dance halls strong #

01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:13.560
# Beats not worthy of my cause
I prolong extravaganza #

01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:15.560
# Time sits still
No propaganda #

01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:17.960
# Be wary of the skill
as I bring forth the music #

01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:19.260
# Make love to your eardrum #

01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:21.660
# Dedicated to rap
Nigger, beware the fearsome #

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:23.860
# Lebanon dawn
Malcolm X beat threat #

01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:26.260
# CD Massacre
Murder to Cassette #

01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:28.660
# I blow the shop up
You ain't seen nuttin' yet #

01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:31.060
# One man ran
Tryin' to get away from it #

01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:33.460
# Put your bifocal on
Watch me a-cometh #

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:35.660
# lnto your chamber
like Freddy into dream #

01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:38.060
# Discomboomerated technique
in your scheme #

01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:40.360
# Four clause applause
Like a blackjack did that #

01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:42.860
# You stuck on stupid
like I'm stuck on the map #

01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:45.160
# Nowhere to go
except next show, bro #

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:48.160
# Entertain the motherfuckers
Can't stop, oh, in battlin' #

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:49.860
# You don't want me
to start tattlin' #

01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:52.260
# All up on the stage 'cause
your snakes keep rattlin' #

01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:54.560
# Bitch, you ain't got nothin'
on the rich #

01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:56.760
# Every other day
my ho dress code switch #

01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:59.160
# So just in case you wanna
clock me like Sherry #

01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:01.560
# All y'all crab bitches
ain't got to worry #

01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:03.960
# Can't get a nigger like Don
dime a dozen #

01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:06.160
# Even if I'm smoked out
I can't be scoped out #

01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:08.660
# I'm too ill
I represent Parkhill #

01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:10.960
# See my face
on a twenty-dollar bill #

01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:13.260
# Cashin' in
and get ten dollars back #

01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:15.660
# The phat L.P.
with Cappuccino on the wax #

01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:17.960
# Pass it in your thing
Put valve up to twelve #

01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:20.260
# Put all the other L.P.s
back on the shelf #

01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:22.760
# And smoke a blunt
and dial 9-1-7 #

01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:25.060
# 1-6-0-4-9-3-11 #

01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:27.360
# You could get long dick
hip-hop effects in #

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:29.660
# I'll damage any MC
who step in my direction #

01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:32.060
# I'm Staten lsland's best son
Fuck what you heard #

01:24:32.060 --> 01:24:34.460
# Nigger still talkin' that shit
is absurd #

01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:36.860
# My repertoire is U.S.S.R. #

01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:38.960
# P.L.O. style
got thrown out the car #

01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:41.560
# And ran over
by the method man Jeep #

01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:43.560
# Divine can't define
My style is so deep #

01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:47.160
# Like pussy, My loc'd up face
stay bushy like a porkypine #

01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:50.760
# I part backs like a spine
Gut you like a blunt
and reconstruct your design #

01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:53.060
# I know you wanna dis me
but I can read your mind #

01:24:53.060 --> 01:24:55.560
# 'Cause you weak in the knees
like S.W.V. #

01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:57.860
# Tryin' to get a title
like Wu Killer Bee #

01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:00.460
# Can't change, you have it
You know I'm friends with the habit #

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:03.260
# Me and Razor Raw name
printed in the tablet under "best" #

01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:05.060
# We paid our debts
for nine years #

01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:06.860
# Haven't made a sound
and now we out like beers #

01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:09.760
# lnborn power
Born physically power speakin' #

01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:12.360
# The truth in the song
Be the pro-black teachin' ##
