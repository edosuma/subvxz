Dad.

19:35.550 --> 19:40.388
Well, John, who, you know, asked Dad...

19:41.932 --> 19:46.519
on my behalf and... Dad said no.

19:50.148 --> 19:52.943
[Meg]
Mom? Mom.

19:53.151 --> 19:54.569
I got us some answers.

19:54.778 --> 19:57.196
They're taking Dad for a CT scan.

19:57.405 --> 19:59.157
You should come with me.

20:07.958 --> 20:09.417
Hey...

20:10.585 --> 20:12.462
you wanna go talk outside?

20:13.171 --> 20:15.381
Yeah. Sure.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.425
Just-- Yeah.

20:23.807 --> 20:25.934
[sighing]

20:32.649 --> 20:33.817
Oh.

20:33.984 --> 20:36.527
[John] I drove you to the bus stop.
You said you were leaving.

20:36.694 --> 20:38.446
[Danny]
I was. I mean...

20:39.697 --> 20:41.658
It just didn't feel right.

20:41.992 --> 20:43.701
What didn't feel right?

20:44.535 --> 20:46.454
Leaving without saying goodbye to Dad.

20:46.663 --> 20:49.916
So you stayed to say goodbye to Dad.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.378
I mean, that's the only reason?

20:56.714 --> 20:58.508
Sure you don't wanna
read me my rights?

20:59.717 --> 21:02.637
- All right. So you go out, what happens?
- We talked for a bit.

21:02.846 --> 21:05.807
He got back in his kayak, paddled away,
and then, boom, flipped.

21:06.016 --> 21:07.475
He flipped?

21:07.976 --> 21:09.477
Just like that? He flipped over?

21:09.686 --> 21:12.022
- What'd you do to him?
- I didn't fucking do any--

21:12.230 --> 21:13.523
What are you talking about?

21:13.731 --> 21:15.566
So you go out there
and you say goodbye.

21:16.442 --> 21:17.861
[sighs]

21:22.740 --> 21:25.451
Because I didn't wanna leave
with any bad blood.

21:26.786 --> 21:30.957
So, uh, I told him
there was no hard feelings.

21:31.749 --> 21:33.168
And what did Dad say?

21:33.376 --> 21:35.419
[♪♪♪]

21:36.254 --> 21:37.505
Nothing.

21:39.049 --> 21:42.886
He just got back in the kayak, rode away.
Then, boom, it happened. He collapsed.

21:43.094 --> 21:45.429
He collapsed. You keep saying this
over and over,

21:45.638 --> 21:47.849
but it doesn't
make any sense. I don't--

21:48.058 --> 21:52.937
He was in the kayak,
and then he just fell over. Went limp.

21:53.312 --> 21:56.440
- How did you hurt yourself?
- [Kevin] How'd you hurt your shoulder?

21:56.524 --> 21:59.694
By dragging him out of the water
while I was trying to save his life.

21:59.903 --> 22:02.530
- How'd you get to the hospital?
- Flagged down a couple guys.

22:02.739 --> 22:06.243
Waved down guys? They just happened
to be there? What were they doing?

22:06.450 --> 22:08.036
I don't know. Fishing.

22:08.245 --> 22:11.289
- Fishing.
- It's illegal to fish out there.

22:11.497 --> 22:13.457
Maybe they're the ones
you wanna go arrest.

22:13.666 --> 22:16.127
- John. This is bullshit.
- Shut up, you fucking prick.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.379
- You weren't there.
- You know it. I know it.

22:18.588 --> 22:20.048
- Even he knows it.
- [Danny] Shut up.

22:20.215 --> 22:23.260
- [Kevin] Can't tell me you believe this.
- You don't know what the fuck--

22:23.467 --> 22:25.428
- John-- I'm not gonna talk to you!
- Prick.

22:25.636 --> 22:28.014
You need to shut the fuck up
for once in your life!

22:28.223 --> 22:32.269
Mr. Rayburn?
Dr. Weston is ready with your x-rays.

22:33.644 --> 22:35.230
Oh, yeah.

22:35.396 --> 22:37.190
Oh, good. Okay.

22:38.816 --> 22:41.069
[♪♪♪]

22:41.278 --> 22:43.821
I'll be inside in a minute.
I'll be inside in a minute.

22:59.296 --> 23:01.172
Hey. John Rayburn.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.968
I'm wondering if you can track down
a parolee for me.

23:06.010 --> 23:07.804
Eric O'Bannon.

23:13.601 --> 23:15.061
[line ringing]

23:15.145 --> 23:18.397
[Danny on recording]
Hey, you've reached Danny. Do it.

23:26.614 --> 23:27.991
[sighs]

23:30.910 --> 23:32.870
Well, it looks good from here.

23:33.079 --> 23:34.331
[Weston]
Not from here.

23:34.538 --> 23:37.041
But you're right. Nothing's broken.

23:37.250 --> 23:40.753
I told you that.
Now can we please get this thing filled?

23:41.254 --> 23:42.755
Nothing's broken now.

23:42.964 --> 23:44.841
But there's an old fracture. A bad one.

23:45.049 --> 23:46.968
That's the reason
you've got chronic pain.

23:47.177 --> 23:48.511
How did this happen?

23:51.514 --> 23:54.725
Drunk driver.
Hit-and-run when I was a kid.

23:55.143 --> 23:57.436
- Well, it didn't heal properly.
- [loudly] Yeah, I--!

23:57.645 --> 23:59.272
And I'm in pain. Okay?

24:00.481 --> 24:02.733
I just pulled my goddamned dad
out of the ocean.

24:02.942 --> 24:06.112
Just do your fucking job.
Fill this. Please.

24:06.570 --> 24:08.198
[in normal voice]
Please.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.201
I'll call it into the pharmacy.

24:18.749 --> 24:20.459
They're gonna start showing up soon.

24:21.294 --> 24:23.462
- Who is?
- The incoming guests.

24:23.880 --> 24:26.716
Mom, I told you, don't worry.
I already talked to the staff.

24:26.924 --> 24:28.385
No. There are things that I do.

24:28.592 --> 24:31.179
The curtains won't be right.
And the pillows.

24:31.804 --> 24:34.598
I-- I need to be there.
Maybe I'll make a quick run back.

24:34.807 --> 24:38.269
Mom. I'll take care of it.

24:38.519 --> 24:40.521
[ringtone playing on cell phone]

24:42.023 --> 24:44.483
- Where the fuck are you?
- I'll be there soon.

24:44.692 --> 24:46.819
Fuck you. It's too late for that.

24:47.028 --> 24:48.821
No, no, no. I'm-- I'm on my way.

24:49.697 --> 24:53.659
I don't have the boat anymore, okay?
My friend needed it and we are fucked.

24:53.910 --> 24:55.203
[sighs]

24:55.953 --> 24:57.205
Let's just do it tomorrow.

24:57.288 --> 24:59.374
Asshole,
you are not fucking getting this.

24:59.582 --> 25:02.460
Tomorrow is not a fucking option, okay?

25:02.668 --> 25:03.920
Goddamn it.

25:04.128 --> 25:06.630
I tried to do you a favor, you know?
And you fucked me!

25:06.839 --> 25:09.342
All right! All right. Um...

25:09.426 --> 25:11.428
[♪♪♪]

25:13.096 --> 25:15.514
Pick me up at the gas station
next to Island Village.

25:16.015 --> 25:18.268
I'll try to get my family's boat.

25:20.437 --> 25:21.479
Fuck!

25:21.687 --> 25:23.189
- [Diana] Honey.
- Hey.

25:23.398 --> 25:24.482
How is he?

25:26.234 --> 25:29.195
- Should I get the kids?
- No. No, leave the kids where they are.

25:29.404 --> 25:30.780
He, um--

25:32.740 --> 25:35.118
The doctors think that he
had a stroke on the water.

25:35.326 --> 25:36.577
Oh, God.

25:36.786 --> 25:38.955
The thing is, Danny was there
when it happened.

25:39.163 --> 25:40.998
He brought Dad into the hospital.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.000
I thought Danny went back.

25:43.209 --> 25:46.879
Well, he's saying that he stayed because
he wanted to say goodbye to Dad, so...

25:47.088 --> 25:48.547
Do you believe that?

25:50.425 --> 25:52.551
[cell phone ringing]

25:54.762 --> 25:55.805
Rayburn.

25:56.013 --> 25:58.599
Yeah, O'Bannon's boss said
he never showed this morning.

25:58.808 --> 26:00.351
Yeah, he called in sick.

26:00.559 --> 26:03.480
Yeah, could be home in bed
or out fucking around.

26:03.687 --> 26:06.316
- What, you want me to pay him a visit?
- No, I got it.

26:06.857 --> 26:08.818
What, you--
You liking him for something?

26:09.026 --> 26:11.154
No, I'm not sure yet. I'll just, uh...

26:11.362 --> 26:13.197
Look, Chuck, I'll get in touch with you.

26:13.406 --> 26:16.493
- I appreciate it. I owe you one, yeah?
- All right, sure thing, man.

26:16.700 --> 26:17.952
All right.

26:18.035 --> 26:20.037
[♪♪♪]

26:21.539 --> 26:23.624
Why do you think he stayed?

26:26.961 --> 26:28.546
I don't know, but we'll find out.

26:29.339 --> 26:31.007
Have the weekend guests checked out?

26:31.215 --> 26:33.050
Yeah. All but Bungalows 4 and 7.

26:33.259 --> 26:36.179
Okay, and the other rooms?
Have they been made up?

26:36.387 --> 26:39.598
- It's happening right now.
- Great. What about the curtains?

26:39.765 --> 26:41.351
Well, we always do that last.

26:41.559 --> 26:44.061
- Then Mama Ray double-checks them.
- Let's do those now.

26:44.562 --> 26:46.356
The new guests won't be coming until--

26:46.564 --> 26:48.149
No, I know, but let's do them now.

26:48.316 --> 26:52.069
I'll check on them and take pictures
on my phone so I can show my mom.

26:52.153 --> 26:53.321
Okay.

26:53.530 --> 26:56.240
Actually, you know what?
I can just do that myself.

26:56.449 --> 26:57.783
You keep checking people out.

26:57.992 --> 27:01.538
I'll meet you in the main kitchen after,
we can go over the menu for tonight.

27:02.497 --> 27:05.958
You can go to the hospital, sweetheart.
I really can handle all of this.

27:06.167 --> 27:07.418
No, of course. I know that.

27:07.626 --> 27:10.754
But it'll keep my mom calm to know
that I'm doing it. Thank you.

27:12.298 --> 27:14.300
[speaking indistinctly]

27:14.592 --> 27:16.760
Excuse me. I'm looking for my brother.

27:16.969 --> 27:19.138
The one that brought my father in.
Mr. Rayburn?

27:19.347 --> 27:21.432
Oh, I'm sorry. I think he left.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.852
- Do you know when he left?
- Just a few minutes ago.

27:25.061 --> 27:26.563
[doctor]
Are you asking about Danny?

27:26.729 --> 27:28.939
- Yes.
- Hi. John, right?

27:29.106 --> 27:30.358
- Yes.
- I've treated your mom.

27:30.525 --> 27:31.942
- Oh, hello.
- Yeah.

27:32.109 --> 27:34.320
I know you've got a lot
going on,

27:34.529 --> 27:36.364
but can I talk to you a second?

27:38.074 --> 27:40.201
Your brother came to see me earlier.

27:40.701 --> 27:42.453
His shoulder's in a lot of pain.

27:42.912 --> 27:45.623
I'm not sure I should be talking to you
about this, but...

27:47.250 --> 27:49.210
His behavior concerns me.

27:49.419 --> 27:51.629
I think he may have an issue
with painkillers.

27:52.838 --> 27:55.925
- You might just wanna keep an eye him.
- Okay.

27:56.092 --> 27:58.802
And at some point,
he should get that old injury looked at.

27:59.470 --> 28:02.223
- What injury?
- From when he was a kid.

28:02.432 --> 28:04.058
The hit-and-run.

28:04.808 --> 28:08.729
- A car accident?
- Uh, yes. Yes.

28:08.938 --> 28:10.648
The shoulder never healed properly,

28:10.856 --> 28:14.193
and that's the kind of thing
that just gets worse as you get older.

28:14.402 --> 28:15.903
May wanna consider surgery.

28:16.237 --> 28:18.573
Yeah, I'll talk to him about that.

28:18.781 --> 28:20.366
- Okay. Sure.
- Thank you very much.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.745
[young Danny]
No! Dad! No!

28:25.288 --> 28:26.747
No, Dad!

[♪♪♪]

28:50.771 --> 28:52.440
Hey, your lady's here.

28:52.649 --> 28:54.484
Don't worry about it. I got it.

28:55.276 --> 28:58.070
Okay. Gas her up for me, will you,
for the cruise tonight?

29:00.364 --> 29:02.492
- [Kevin] Hey.
- I'm so sorry, Kev.

29:04.076 --> 29:07.204
- I brought you some clean clothes.
- Thanks.

29:08.665 --> 29:12.460
- So it was a stroke?
- Yeah, it was a stroke.

29:13.127 --> 29:16.213
- If you believe that.
- What do you mean?

29:17.214 --> 29:20.176
All I know is, my Dad was fine last night.

29:20.801 --> 29:22.761
And then Danny showed up.

29:24.888 --> 29:28.726
Kevin, if the doctor said
it was a stroke, then it was a--

29:30.102 --> 29:31.437
Kevin, wait.

29:35.024 --> 29:38.027
You need to take a deep breath
and cool off.

29:38.528 --> 29:40.571
This is exactly
what I've been talking about.

29:40.738 --> 29:44.116
Really?
You gonna start this shit with me now?

29:44.325 --> 29:47.828
- You gonna make this about us?
- No. I'm gonna make it about you.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.789
Last thing your family needs
is you flying off the handle.

29:50.998 --> 29:53.834
- Find a different way to handle this.
- Thank you for the clothes.

29:54.043 --> 29:55.712
- I gotta get to the hospital.
- Kevin.

29:55.919 --> 29:57.838
- I gotta go see my dad.
- Kevin.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.762
[Wink on TV]
It's now worth $2000 as we shuffle.

30:04.845 --> 30:06.639
[beeping on TV]

30:06.723 --> 30:07.724
[knock on door]

30:07.806 --> 30:12.228
- And we're back to Lieutenant Thom McKee.
- [Thom] Wink, why don't we try The '70s?

30:12.311 --> 30:15.439
[Wink]
The 1970s. The subject question is this:

30:15.523 --> 30:17.024
In May of 1975...

30:17.233 --> 30:19.235
[Wink & Thom speaking indistinctly on TV]

30:29.328 --> 30:32.164
Right. Put an X in that box.

30:32.498 --> 30:36.126
- So, what'd my brother do now?
- I don't know, you tell me.

30:36.210 --> 30:37.336
[turns off TV]

30:39.422 --> 30:43.300
Look, I'm trying to play it cool, John,
but I don't like that you're here.

30:43.509 --> 30:45.302
Well, why would that be?

30:48.389 --> 30:51.225
Since my brother got out,
I swear he's trying.

30:51.934 --> 30:56.397
Parole officer even put a couple
gold stars on the fridge.

30:58.148 --> 31:00.276
Do you know
where my brother Danny is?

31:02.861 --> 31:06.115
- I don't wanna get anyone in trouble.
- Neither do I.

31:07.241 --> 31:10.953
My dad's in the hospital.
I need to talk to him about some stuff.

31:14.707 --> 31:16.417
He slept here last night.

31:16.959 --> 31:20.671
But he left early, took his stuff,
and I haven't seen him since.

31:20.797 --> 31:22.131
Oh.

31:23.048 --> 31:24.258
[chuckles]

31:24.925 --> 31:27.511
Because I know Eric
called in to work sick.

31:27.720 --> 31:30.013
And he's not here,
so that probably means he's not sick.

31:30.180 --> 31:32.349
Probably means he's with Danny.

31:34.935 --> 31:37.396
So don't know where they are?

31:37.605 --> 31:39.356
No. I don't know.

31:39.565 --> 31:40.983
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

31:41.191 --> 31:45.028
Don't bullshit me. Look, I'm not
trying to jam up your brother here.

31:47.072 --> 31:50.200
You know he's breaking his parole,
don't you?

31:50.284 --> 31:54.580
You talk to me this once,
nobody has to know anything.

31:56.165 --> 32:00.670
You care about Eric, you don't want him
to get in trouble. Where are they?

32:00.753 --> 32:02.588
