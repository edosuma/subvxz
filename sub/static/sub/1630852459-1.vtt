00:07.716 --> 00:10.135
<i>At night,</i>
<i>the brightest reflection in the skies</i>

00:10.218 --> 00:14.139
<i>over New York comes from the area</i>
<i>around Times Square and Broadway.</i>

00:14.222 --> 00:16.516
<i>Thousands</i>
<i>of pleasure-seekers, like moths,</i>

00:16.599 --> 00:17.892
<i>are lured to its light.</i>

00:17.976 --> 00:20.478
<i>These sights and sounds are only a part</i>

00:20.562 --> 00:23.898
<i>of</i> <i>one of the most astonishing</i>
<i>and complicated areas in the world.</i>

00:26.985 --> 00:29.404
The whole world
is attracted to Times Square.

00:29.904 --> 00:32.866
They're entranced
and a little bit drunk off all the lights

00:32.949 --> 00:34.909
and all of the show business.

00:35.535 --> 00:40.290
But tourists don't know
what was there 45 years ago.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.504
In the late '70s,

00:46.588 --> 00:49.257
Times Square was considered an atrocity.

00:51.009 --> 00:54.971
Times Square was
a very sexually-charged atmosphere.

00:55.930 --> 00:58.641
The whole scene was something to see

00:58.725 --> 01:01.394
because it was, like,
out of Dante's<i> Inferno.</i>

01:04.314 --> 01:09.360
There were guys walking around out there
that were pure predators.

01:10.320 --> 01:13.782
The fear behind that was palpable.

01:13.865 --> 01:14.991
You could feel it.

01:17.577 --> 01:18.995
It's not easy to find a newscast

01:19.079 --> 01:21.372
with no reference
to violence and murder these days,

01:21.456 --> 01:23.750
but this week got off
to an unusually violent start

01:23.833 --> 01:25.126
right here in Midtown Manhattan.

01:27.879 --> 01:33.593
I was in the 10th Precinct
in Manhattan covering Times Square,

01:33.676 --> 01:36.054
just, uh, a uniform cop on patrol.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.351
This was December of '79,

01:41.434 --> 01:44.395
and we're stopped at a light
at 42nd Street

01:45.396 --> 01:51.486
when we saw fire trucks parked
in front of the Travel Inn hotel.

01:59.202 --> 02:00.620
When we pulled up,

02:01.246 --> 02:03.123
they excitedly said,

02:03.623 --> 02:05.583
"You better go up to the fourth floor."

02:13.049 --> 02:16.052
There was a fire in room 417.

02:17.512 --> 02:22.976
Rescue Company 1 was told that
there were likely guests inside the room.

02:24.561 --> 02:27.939
So you had the smell from burning flesh,

02:28.022 --> 02:30.316
and the smoke was thick.

02:32.152 --> 02:35.530
They crawled into the room,
not being able to see.

02:39.951 --> 02:44.831
They made out the shape
of bodies on the twin beds.

02:48.084 --> 02:52.213
One of the firemen went to give CPR…

02:56.885 --> 02:59.846
but she had no head or hands.

03:01.222 --> 03:04.267
Knocked him back
against the wall, naturally.

03:05.435 --> 03:08.813
The sergeant turned to me, and he said,

03:09.898 --> 03:12.066
"A real sick bastard did this."

03:44.515 --> 03:48.228
Firemen were first to arrive
at the scene at about 9:30 this morning.

03:49.437 --> 03:52.941
They were responding to a report
of a fire in a West Side hotel room.

03:54.525 --> 03:56.903
They found much more
than they had anticipated.

03:57.987 --> 04:00.990
Two women were found decapitated,
their hands cut off as well.

04:03.785 --> 04:06.746
Did it seem
that the women had been killed recently

04:06.829 --> 04:08.122
when you arrived?

04:08.206 --> 04:10.291
I would say so, yeah,
within a couple hours.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.835
It seems the suspect
tried to cover his tracks

04:12.919 --> 04:14.754
by setting the two beds on fire.

04:14.837 --> 04:16.881
Two separate fires,
two separate mattresses,

04:16.965 --> 04:18.049
two separate beds.

04:18.132 --> 04:19.050
For how long?

04:19.759 --> 04:21.010
Five minutes, tops.

04:30.270 --> 04:34.274
I spent 31 and a half years
with the New York City Police Department.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.780
You wouldn't believe the things I've seen.

04:42.907 --> 04:45.285
And for something to stand out,

04:45.368 --> 04:50.331
it's gotta be really bad. It has to be
absolutely horrifying to stand out.

04:50.415 --> 04:51.874
And this case did stand out.

04:54.419 --> 04:57.714
It was pretty much
the hotel room from hell.

05:01.759 --> 05:05.680
I saw the headlines before I got
the information from the NYPD,

05:05.763 --> 05:08.141
and the case immediately intrigued me.

05:10.101 --> 05:13.396
I'm a homicide and forensic expert
and consultant.

05:13.479 --> 05:15.565
I'm the former commander
of Bronx Homicide.

05:17.692 --> 05:19.485
At the time, I called up Jerry McQueen,

05:19.569 --> 05:22.864
who was the detective sergeant
who was in charge of the investigation,

05:22.947 --> 05:25.366
and he basically filled me in
what they had.

05:29.037 --> 05:31.914
The immediate problem
for the investigators was…

05:33.916 --> 05:35.710
"Who are these victims?"

05:40.048 --> 05:41.841
The first thing
you look for is fingerprints,

05:41.924 --> 05:45.053
but in this case, you were deprived
of fingerprints 'cause there's no hands.

05:46.471 --> 05:50.058
Our first inclination is that
he wants to prevent identification.

05:50.141 --> 05:52.060
That's why the heads and hands are gone.

05:52.977 --> 05:54.228
We had nothing else.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.939
No wallet, no ID, no identification cards.

05:57.982 --> 06:00.276
And don't forget, it's… it's 1979.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.404
We don't have all this video surveillance
that we have today, okay?

06:03.488 --> 06:05.073
We don't have DNA technology.

06:05.156 --> 06:08.326
It won't-- DNA technology won't come up
for another seven years.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.203
Very frustrating.

06:13.289 --> 06:19.128
The firemen said that
they felt it was a poorly conceived fire,

06:19.212 --> 06:24.175
more likely to draw attention to the room

06:24.258 --> 06:26.427
than it was to do any damage.

06:27.095 --> 06:29.764
In fact, one detective said to me

06:29.847 --> 06:32.183
it was the cleanest crime scene
he's ever seen.

06:32.850 --> 06:35.228
It was totally devoid of evidence.

06:37.021 --> 06:41.734
Spatter, gore, puddles,
fingerprints, there was nothing.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.654
How… how can you behead two women,

06:44.737 --> 06:47.073
chop off the… the hands of two women,

06:47.156 --> 06:50.743
and not have gore
from one end to the other?

06:52.453 --> 06:56.541
I did see the clothing
from the victims

06:56.624 --> 07:00.336
was piled neatly in the bathtub.

07:02.296 --> 07:04.549
You know, it seemed strange
to me at the time.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.928
<i>This killer went</i>
<i>to great lengths to destroy</i>

07:09.011 --> 07:10.346
<i>the women's identities.</i>

07:10.430 --> 07:13.141
<i>So why would he leave behind</i>
<i>the women's clothing?</i>

07:13.224 --> 07:16.227
<i>Possibly they were his gimmicks,</i>
<i>planted there,</i>

07:16.310 --> 07:18.646
<i>like the little fire he started Sunday.</i>

07:20.231 --> 07:22.275
One of the maids
from the fourth floor,

07:22.358 --> 07:26.279
uh, discovered smoke
coming from under the door

07:26.988 --> 07:31.742
and, uh, trying to open the door
to, uh, get in there.

07:31.826 --> 07:34.245
Had anybody heard
any kind of a struggle?

07:34.328 --> 07:35.830
Any noise in that room?

07:35.913 --> 07:39.292
It was don't disturb.
Don't disturb. That's all.

07:41.043 --> 07:43.880
The don't disturb sign,
was that up all along?

07:45.131 --> 07:45.965
Yes.

07:52.180 --> 07:56.100
The offender came in
on November 29th into that hotel,

07:56.726 --> 07:59.145
and he did not leave till December 2nd.

08:00.938 --> 08:02.523
A period of three days.

08:04.609 --> 08:07.570
He very cleverly signed in
as a Carl Wilson

08:07.653 --> 08:09.530
from Maryland, New Jersey,

08:10.907 --> 08:12.283
which was a fake name.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.287
The only time he was seen
was at registration.

08:21.292 --> 08:26.464
A woman stood behind him
as the subject was registering.

08:27.798 --> 08:30.426
He was alone. She was alone.

08:32.595 --> 08:35.223
But for whatever reason,
she paid attention…

08:37.683 --> 08:40.978
and they drew a composite
from her description.

08:44.649 --> 08:47.360
<i>This is the sketch</i>
<i>of the man wanted for questioning.</i>

08:47.443 --> 08:51.113
<i>He's white, 35 years old,</i>
<i>about 5'10" tall,</i>

08:51.197 --> 08:53.741
<i>and weighing 175 pounds.</i>

08:53.824 --> 08:56.369
<i>They say he has brown hair,</i>
<i>which is blow-dried.</i>

08:56.452 --> 09:00.998
<i>By that, they told me they mean this man</i>
<i>is very meticulous about his appearance.</i>

09:02.833 --> 09:05.962
In a case like this,
the police have an uphill battle

09:06.045 --> 09:09.757
because of the location
down in Times Square.

09:11.842 --> 09:16.681
Back then, it was rampant crime
of every description going on

09:17.390 --> 09:20.851
on every block,
on every corner, in every alleyway.

09:22.687 --> 09:26.566
This was a place
where someone could go unnoticed.

09:28.734 --> 09:32.989
When you're looking for a killer
in 1970s Times Square,

09:34.156 --> 09:37.577
you're looking for a needle in a haystack.

09:42.832 --> 09:46.752
There was more of a crowd in Times Square
than anywhere else in the city.

09:50.631 --> 09:52.008
There were tourists,

09:53.134 --> 09:54.802
countless businessmen…

09:55.303 --> 09:57.763
Yes, sir, what can I do for you, buddy?
What do you need today?

09:57.847 --> 10:00.558
…hustlers and three-card monte guys.

10:01.058 --> 10:03.352
Guys right out of Rikers Island.

10:06.022 --> 10:08.649
When you have the entire world
passing through,

10:09.817 --> 10:11.569
anybody could be in there.

10:14.322 --> 10:15.573
It's a hustle and bustle

10:15.656 --> 10:18.659
that's unparalleled
anywhere else in this country.

10:21.454 --> 10:24.040
I spent my entire twenties

10:24.123 --> 10:26.876
in the 1970s and '80s in Times Square.

10:27.668 --> 10:31.589
I was a writer covering the neighborhood
for men's magazines.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.926
There's probably no "official"
official designation

10:36.010 --> 10:39.138
of exactly to the foot
which makes up Times Square…

10:40.473 --> 10:45.645
…but because it's in my blood,
and I've spent so many years there

10:46.896 --> 10:49.940
between 42nd Street and 50th Street,

10:51.108 --> 10:54.070
between 8th Avenue and 6th Avenue.

10:54.987 --> 10:56.489
Those 13 blocks,

10:56.572 --> 10:59.450
that's my definition of Times Square.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.413
"The Deuce" was a nickname
at the time.

11:04.497 --> 11:07.583
It really referred to 42nd Street itself,

11:07.667 --> 11:11.921
particularly between 7th and 8th Avenue,
which is really the heart of Times Square.

11:13.506 --> 11:18.344
At its peak, it was a meeting place.
It was a place of entertainment.

11:18.427 --> 11:21.305
It was part
of the central business district.

11:21.806 --> 11:24.725
Almost all subway lines
come to Times Square.

11:25.351 --> 11:28.688
The Port Authority Bus Terminal
brings people from New Jersey

11:28.771 --> 11:30.690
but also people from around the country.

11:31.857 --> 11:34.193
For me,
it's always been a destination.

11:35.069 --> 11:37.363
I remember coming here and seeing

11:37.446 --> 11:39.657
the Camel ad where
the guy blows smoke rings.

11:41.325 --> 11:42.702
That was so cool.

11:42.785 --> 11:46.539
I mean, anything else
paled in comparison to that.

11:48.207 --> 11:52.545
There were Broadway shows,
and theaters were bustling,

11:53.129 --> 11:56.507
and it was like an element
of being in the Wild West.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.926
You know, where you didn't know
what was gonna happen,

11:59.009 --> 12:01.595
and you were going there
because you wanted to have an adventure.

12:03.055 --> 12:05.975
Times Square 42nd Street
was a collecting point…

12:07.977 --> 12:11.313
for all sorts of people.
It was like a… like a drain, you know?

12:11.397 --> 12:12.857
Everything came there.

12:18.279 --> 12:21.198
You have those
who are the denizens of the Deuce,

12:21.282 --> 12:23.576
who have lived there, they worked there,

12:23.659 --> 12:25.077
they partied there.

12:28.873 --> 12:32.960
But you have all these newcomers
who did not learn to be street-smart.

12:34.378 --> 12:37.882
And if you are not used
to being in a place

12:37.965 --> 12:40.676
where there are so many people
bumping up against you,

12:40.760 --> 12:42.470
so many lights, loud music,

12:42.553 --> 12:44.221
everything else,

12:44.305 --> 12:46.891
it's easy to become a victim

12:46.974 --> 12:49.769
because there were bad people out there.

12:58.277 --> 13:00.863
<i>For the past two weeks,</i>
<i>we've told you about the hunt</i>

13:00.946 --> 13:04.366
<i>for whoever murdered and decapitated</i>
<i>two women in the Times Square hotel.</i>

13:04.450 --> 13:07.244
<i>Authorities are asking anyone</i>
<i>with information about this man</i>

13:07.328 --> 13:08.829
<i>to call a special number.</i>

13:12.458 --> 13:16.587
The media put out
a composite sketch of a potential suspect,

13:18.255 --> 13:21.717
but at the time,
that sketch didn't help the investigation.

13:23.677 --> 13:25.304
Because nobody came forward.

13:25.888 --> 13:26.806
Very frustrating.

13:28.724 --> 13:31.435
<i>Police have had</i>
<i>to resort to the barest of evidence</i>

13:31.519 --> 13:34.313
<i>as a means of tracking down</i>
<i>the victims' identities.</i>

13:34.897 --> 13:36.440
<i>Over at the 20th Precinct,</i>

13:36.524 --> 13:39.401
<i>we saw the sorry remains</i>
<i>of the two young women.</i>

13:39.485 --> 13:42.571
<i>A pair of Bonjour jeans size 7/8,</i>

13:42.655 --> 13:45.199
<i>a pair of patent leather boots,</i>
<i>a red sweater,</i>

13:45.282 --> 13:47.910
<i>a black fur jacket waist-length,</i>

13:47.993 --> 13:49.662
<i>a pair of white leotards,</i>

13:49.745 --> 13:51.997
<i>and a pair of black high-heeled shoes.</i>

13:57.795 --> 14:00.714
Now, in order
to try to identify the victims,

14:00.798 --> 14:04.468
the investigators came up with the idea
of why don't we take these clothes

14:04.552 --> 14:06.929
that had been left behind
in the hotel room

14:07.012 --> 14:09.557
and see if we get some feedback
from the general public?

14:10.933 --> 14:12.268
One of the detectives said,

14:12.351 --> 14:15.062
"Listen, in Midtown,
we have all these department stores."

14:16.939 --> 14:20.317
"Why don't we get mannequins
from the department store

14:20.401 --> 14:22.528
and dress the mannequin in the clothing

14:24.280 --> 14:28.367
to see if anyone could identify these gals
based on the clothing?"

14:29.076 --> 14:31.912
Police tell us
they'll call a press conference tomorrow.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.039
The purpose is to dress up some mannequins

14:34.123 --> 14:36.458
with the same clothes
they showed us last week.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.634
So the mannequins were dressed,

14:46.343 --> 14:47.469
photographed,

14:49.179 --> 14:51.599
and circulars went up all over the place.

14:53.100 --> 14:56.270
They were in the newspaper.
They were on television.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.772
They were at 42nd Street.

14:59.356 --> 15:00.983
They were on light poles.

15:02.484 --> 15:06.030
Wherever you could stick
a poster with that, they were there.

15:06.530 --> 15:08.616
If you recognize
the victim's clothing,

15:08.699 --> 15:11.285
or if you have any information
that might help the police,

15:11.368 --> 15:14.038
the number to call is 477-74--

15:25.174 --> 15:27.051
In 1979,

15:27.927 --> 15:29.678
I was a crime reporter.

15:33.807 --> 15:35.017
I had covered crime,

15:35.768 --> 15:38.062
but I had never covered crime

15:38.145 --> 15:40.356
as salacious and as evil

15:40.439 --> 15:42.149
and as, uh…

15:42.232 --> 15:43.400
brutal, really.

15:44.693 --> 15:47.696
I got to know the detectives on this case

15:48.697 --> 15:51.241
and took a lot of interest
in what they were doing.

15:53.494 --> 15:58.332
And finally, they were given a tip
about one of the victims.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.464
A woman named Rose
called the police

16:06.757 --> 16:11.929
and said, "I recognize the outfit
that you have put on the television

16:12.012 --> 16:14.765
in regards to this woman."

16:14.848 --> 16:16.850
"These were my friend's clothes."

16:18.268 --> 16:21.605
She said it was the outfit and shoes

16:22.272 --> 16:24.400
her friend left the house in.

16:26.568 --> 16:29.655
Although police apparently aren't close
to making any arrests,

16:29.738 --> 16:31.281
they had a major break today

16:31.365 --> 16:33.659
when they managed to identify
one of the victims.

16:34.535 --> 16:36.537
<i>Police called on</i>
<i>the public for assistance</i>

16:36.620 --> 16:38.455
<i>and received numerous phone calls.</i>

16:39.206 --> 16:42.793
<i>One of these calls was part of the process</i>
<i>which led to identification.</i>

16:42.876 --> 16:44.294
<i>Medical records were checked,</i>

16:44.378 --> 16:47.089
<i>and identification</i>
<i>came from distinguishing characteristics</i>

16:47.172 --> 16:49.508
<i>of certain bones and scars on the body.</i>

16:50.134 --> 16:51.927
If you feel the back of your neck,

16:52.011 --> 16:56.056
uh, there are bony prominences
that can be noted,

16:56.140 --> 16:59.476
and those had
a very characteristic, uh, shape.

17:00.060 --> 17:03.355
It's on that basis
that the identification was made.

17:10.612 --> 17:12.698
One of the victims from the Travel Inn

17:12.781 --> 17:15.826
was identified as Deedeh Goodarzi,

17:15.909 --> 17:19.413
who… was my birth mother.

17:23.500 --> 17:26.253
I was adopted…

17:28.756 --> 17:30.090
at ten weeks.

17:31.550 --> 17:32.968
When I was a child,

17:33.052 --> 17:36.180
being adopted
was difficult for me to understand.

17:37.014 --> 17:40.893
I was an unknown.
I don't know where I came from.

17:42.019 --> 17:44.772
I wanted to find my biological mother.

17:49.860 --> 17:52.237
When I turned 26,

17:52.321 --> 17:54.656
I found the orphanage that I came from.

17:55.449 --> 17:58.202
And they said,
"We would love it if you came to see us."

17:58.285 --> 18:02.081
"We have a file for you to look through."

18:05.000 --> 18:09.588
I was expecting a Lifetime movie

18:09.671 --> 18:14.802
where I would get to meet, possibly,
the woman who gave birth to me.

18:17.387 --> 18:18.722
But they gave me

18:20.015 --> 18:24.937
these terrible newspaper articles
about how she was killed.

18:30.400 --> 18:34.321
There was a gorgeous picture
of my mother.

18:35.948 --> 18:36.907
So…

18:39.827 --> 18:43.664
half of me is so excited
to see my mother's face,

18:45.040 --> 18:46.375
and then feeling angry…

18:47.459 --> 18:52.673
…because her life was taken
in such a horrific manner.

18:54.049 --> 18:56.301
It's just, uh, inconceivable.

19:02.349 --> 19:06.854
Deedeh's life started in Iran.

19:09.523 --> 19:15.279
She came to America when she was
around eight or nine, and she

19:15.362 --> 19:18.365
went to Holy Family School in Brooklyn,

19:18.448 --> 19:21.160
but she never finished high school.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.663
She had run away a couple times.

19:26.957 --> 19:31.336
When she became a young adult,
she moved to Trenton, New Jersey,

19:31.420 --> 19:33.338
and I came to find out

19:33.422 --> 19:37.176
that she would take the train
on the weekends to New York City…

19:39.887 --> 19:42.931
…and she was a sex worker there.

19:46.935 --> 19:50.814
Deedeh was considered
a high-priced escort.

19:51.648 --> 19:56.695
She was working in bars,
working at massage parlors.

19:57.613 --> 20:03.660
She was the type of sex worker
that only had a couple clients in one day.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.958
The last time anyone
but her killer saw her alive

20:10.042 --> 20:12.669
was when she was in Trenton
getting on a train for New York

20:12.753 --> 20:14.630
just two days before
she was found murdered.

20:14.713 --> 20:18.175
<i>Police are still looking</i>
<i>for information about the other victim.</i>

20:18.258 --> 20:21.303
Is it your impression that these two women
might have worked together?

20:21.386 --> 20:24.473
I feel that she did, uh,
meet with the unidentified girl

20:24.556 --> 20:26.016
here in the New York City area.

20:28.185 --> 20:29.728
It's still a mystery

20:29.811 --> 20:34.024
how Deedeh Goodarzi ended up
in that room with the other girl.

20:35.108 --> 20:38.737
The other girl we know nothing about.
Not a thing.

20:40.530 --> 20:42.241
She remained a Jane Doe.

20:43.909 --> 20:46.578
But based on Deedeh being a prostitute,

20:46.662 --> 20:51.083
these detectives thought the other victim
was likely a prostitute as well.

20:58.799 --> 21:02.219
The area of Times Square
near the Travel Inn

21:03.762 --> 21:06.390
had become known for sex workers…

21:09.601 --> 21:11.770
who worked the streets,

21:11.853 --> 21:14.356
who worked the hotels,
who worked the bars.

21:15.315 --> 21:17.901
Times Square was thick
with prostitution.

21:17.985 --> 21:22.281
I mean, there were upwards
of 1,200 prostitutes a night.

21:24.992 --> 21:27.494
There were women
and men working.

21:27.577 --> 21:30.163
There might be trans women on one block.

21:30.247 --> 21:32.833
There might be gay hustlers on another.

21:34.626 --> 21:40.424
In the late 1970s,
the operative term for being a sex worker

21:40.507 --> 21:41.883
was "prostitute."

21:43.343 --> 21:45.387
The problem with using
the word "prostitute"

21:45.470 --> 21:49.599
is it is so combined
with the notion of sexual shame.

21:49.683 --> 21:53.478
She's nothing but a slut.
She's a prostitute. She's a whore.

21:54.062 --> 21:57.065
All of those terms
would later be challenged,

21:58.025 --> 22:00.569
and they coined the term "sex worker."

22:04.031 --> 22:07.284
In the 1970s, Times Square became

22:07.367 --> 22:10.662
a sort of epicenter for the sex trade.

22:12.039 --> 22:13.957
It was a sex carnival.

22:15.250 --> 22:19.546
Times Square offered
what you couldn't find anywhere else.

22:21.131 --> 22:24.259
One silver dollar,
we'll make you cum, cum, cum.

22:25.093 --> 22:30.057
It was a place where
you could fulfill forbidden fantasies

22:30.140 --> 22:32.225
in all sorts of different ways.

22:33.352 --> 22:36.772
There were the book stores,
the peep shows,

22:37.522 --> 22:38.899
burlesque clubs,

22:39.608 --> 22:41.193
and the sex emporiums,

22:41.276 --> 22:43.987
with barkers whose main cry was,

22:44.071 --> 22:46.615
"Wall-to-wall pussy."

22:46.698 --> 22:48.867
That was one
of the favorite cries.

22:49.785 --> 22:52.287
Work my body, baby. Ah, yeah.

22:52.371 --> 22:55.207
There was the illusion
that, yes, anything goes,

22:55.290 --> 22:57.709
because that is what brings people in.

22:58.210 --> 23:02.506
People in this country
want to see sex.

23:02.589 --> 23:04.466
You know,
it's like a Chinese proverb that says,

23:04.549 --> 23:07.386
you know, "That which is
the least obtainable is the most desired."

23:07.469 --> 23:09.638
"That which is the most obtainable
is the least desired."

23:09.721 --> 23:11.640
Nothing as sweet as
a stolen cookie.

23:11.723 --> 23:13.725
Yeah, basically.
That's about the size of it.

23:14.726 --> 23:19.648
42nd Street got to be what it was
because of my father,

23:20.232 --> 23:23.610
Martin Hodas,
the porno king of New York City.

23:24.820 --> 23:26.696
He was in the right place
at the right time

23:26.780 --> 23:30.659
and saying,
"Oh my God, do I got a good idea."

23:33.912 --> 23:37.958
In the beginning,
before XXX Times Square emerged,

23:38.625 --> 23:40.001
there were dirty bookstores

23:41.586 --> 23:45.507
where you could get girly magazines,
as they were called at the time.

23:45.590 --> 23:47.801
Very tame stuff by today's standard.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.097
But then in 1967,

23:52.722 --> 23:56.059
Marty Hodas invented the peep show
in Times Square.

23:58.603 --> 24:01.690
The first peep shows
that my father had,

24:03.400 --> 24:04.818
they were the peep machines,

24:06.069 --> 24:11.199
and you'd put a quarter in,
and you'd be watching porno films.

24:16.413 --> 24:20.250
White-collar workers
could sneak off there on their lunch break

24:20.333 --> 24:21.918
and take in something X-rated.

24:23.795 --> 24:27.215
It had a certain appeal to certain people

24:27.299 --> 24:31.261
because of the feeling
of they're doing something naughty.

24:31.344 --> 24:33.680
They're doing something dirty, you know?

24:33.763 --> 24:36.349
They're doing something
they're not supposed to be doing.

24:36.433 --> 24:37.559
That was the appeal.

24:41.062 --> 24:43.690
But then people wanted more,

24:43.773 --> 24:46.234
and my dad loved pushing the envelope.

24:47.736 --> 24:53.658
Any man has the right to view
whatever he feels like viewing,

24:53.742 --> 24:55.535
which is a wonderful thing.

24:55.619 --> 24:58.121
So my father expanded

24:58.205 --> 25:00.624
and expanded and expanded.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.960
He started to make his own films…

25:06.004 --> 25:09.382
and they were hard-core films.

25:10.550 --> 25:13.136
I started making films for him.

25:13.970 --> 25:16.973
I tried to make, you know,
little stories and all this stuff.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.350
Didn't matter.

25:19.768 --> 25:22.312
The viewers, they were in it for the sex.

25:25.106 --> 25:27.984
And once Marty opened the floodgates,

25:28.652 --> 25:31.613
porn had gone from being
this underground thing

25:31.696 --> 25:34.324
to very overtly overground.

25:35.784 --> 25:39.204
X-rated theaters started popping up
all over the place.

25:40.288 --> 25:44.167
Then he started doing the live peep shows.

25:44.793 --> 25:46.962
Come on, check it out.
It's all live.

25:47.045 --> 25:49.339
And it's all happening right here
at Show World Center.

25:50.507 --> 25:53.718
You'd go into a booth,
and you'd put a quarter in,

25:53.802 --> 25:55.512
and the slot went up,

25:55.595 --> 25:58.306
where you'd watch five girls, about,

25:59.266 --> 26:02.185
dancing, stripping, whatnot.

26:02.852 --> 26:06.398
The idea was to keep teasing the patron

26:06.481 --> 26:10.944
so that the patron would keep
popping those tokens into the machine.

26:14.698 --> 26:17.867
At that time, I was a porn star

26:17.951 --> 26:20.203
and a writer for<i> Penthouse.</i>

26:20.787 --> 26:22.956
I covered the sex scene in Times Square,

26:24.374 --> 26:27.252
and I would interview
all of the people who worked there.

26:28.378 --> 26:31.631
Everybody was, you know,
open about being horny.

26:32.591 --> 26:35.218
It was a place
where you could lose yourself.

26:36.928 --> 26:41.057
With every year,
it would get… more transgressive,

26:42.559 --> 26:44.185
more radicalized,

26:45.228 --> 26:46.896
more sexualized.

26:48.106 --> 26:51.026
And then they took the glass
out of the peep shows

26:51.109 --> 26:53.361
so you could interact with…
with the model.

26:54.654 --> 26:57.699
Men could put their hands
through that hole,

26:57.782 --> 26:59.242
and he could touch the girls.

26:59.743 --> 27:01.703
Or he could put his body part in there,

27:01.786 --> 27:04.497
and the girls could give them
hand jobs and blow jobs.

27:06.499 --> 27:10.545
Everybody was really fascinated with sex
and the availability of sex.

27:11.129 --> 27:12.464
People pushed the limits.

27:13.048 --> 27:15.300
The barriers were down, anything went.

27:15.383 --> 27:17.218
And so these businesses,

27:17.302 --> 27:19.971
which seemed to be
about pleasure on one side,

27:20.055 --> 27:22.140
definitely have a much darker side.

27:23.308 --> 27:26.353
There was something…
more than sleazy.

27:26.436 --> 27:27.812
There was something like…

27:27.896 --> 27:29.981
like a little dangerous.

27:31.274 --> 27:36.029
A lot of bad things
just came along with the… business.

27:38.782 --> 27:42.410
There were pimps and drugs
all over the place,

27:43.244 --> 27:46.790
and the mob was really big back then,
Five Families.

27:47.874 --> 27:50.377
Gambino family ran pornography,

27:50.460 --> 27:53.546
but secretly behind the scenes,

27:53.630 --> 27:57.926
all the property and… and the financing
of just about every porn place,

27:58.718 --> 28:01.137
uh, they were mob-owned,
and they were mob-run.

28:04.057 --> 28:08.103
The porn industry
breeded bad people coming in,

28:08.186 --> 28:10.146
and I think it caused more crime.

28:10.230 --> 28:11.314
Yes, I do.

28:11.856 --> 28:14.109
It brought it like a magnet.

28:17.821 --> 28:20.782
I think
some men saw women

28:20.865 --> 28:23.326
as people who could be purchased,

28:23.410 --> 28:26.663
and once they said,
"Oh, I'll do anything,"

28:27.664 --> 28:30.041
those men took that to the limit.

28:34.212 --> 28:35.839
There were predators.

28:36.464 --> 28:40.593
People who came
just to prey on the sex workers.

28:40.677 --> 28:44.139
To be rough with them,
to physically abuse them.

28:45.890 --> 28:47.767
These people are scary.

28:47.851 --> 28:51.896
They think that since no one
can see what they're doing,

28:52.522 --> 28:54.107
that no one's gonna care.

28:55.483 --> 28:59.362
And the sex workers are the ones
that take the wrath.

29:00.780 --> 29:04.576
I think
that whole world

29:04.659 --> 29:08.788
was the reason
why my mother lost her life,

29:08.872 --> 29:11.207
is because it was complete mayhem.

29:18.923 --> 29:21.468
Once they identified
Deedeh Goodarzi,

29:23.219 --> 29:25.513
that was the biggest break they had.

29:26.806 --> 29:30.769
Then the police very much shook the bushes

29:30.852 --> 29:35.190
on trying to find a motive
for Deedeh's murder

29:35.273 --> 29:36.900
and a perpetrator.

29:38.401 --> 29:40.737
You're looking at the people
who are in her world,

29:40.820 --> 29:43.823
in her circle of existence.

29:44.574 --> 29:47.535
Johns, pimps, drug dealers.

29:48.328 --> 29:51.998
That's who you're looking at
and expanding your way outward.

29:54.167 --> 29:59.547
Deedeh had a pimp,
a guy called James Thomas.

29:59.631 --> 30:02.008
She worked for him for years.

30:02.717 --> 30:06.262
She also worked
out of some of the mob-owned bars.

30:07.764 --> 30:12.227
She was familiar
with a number of Iranian drug dealers

30:12.310 --> 30:13.853
that they had interviewed.

30:16.064 --> 30:20.860
But after investigating
all these possible perpetrators…

30:23.196 --> 30:24.614
it came to nothing.

30:26.741 --> 30:28.451
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

30:42.173 --> 30:43.967
<i>Goodbye to the '70s.</i>

30:44.050 --> 30:47.387
<i>A decade of dreams.</i>
<i>A decade of nightmares.</i>

30:47.470 --> 30:51.266
<i>A decade to which</i>
<i>they said farewell here last night.</i>

31:04.571 --> 31:06.281
I had just come back
from Quantico,

31:06.364 --> 31:09.450
and I basically came in
on the ground floor of criminal profiling,

31:10.326 --> 31:11.870
which was new at the time.

31:13.705 --> 31:16.124
Profiling, basically, is an understanding

31:16.207 --> 31:19.627
of the dynamics and behaviors
of offenders and crime scenes.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.463
We look at victimology,

31:22.547 --> 31:25.383
we look at signature, autopsy results,

31:25.466 --> 31:26.634
and we look at MO.

31:33.141 --> 31:36.394
In this case,
the medical examiner was able to determine

31:36.477 --> 31:40.148
that the heads and hands had been removed…
after death, both of them.

31:43.735 --> 31:47.614
Oftentimes you'll find someone
who's not very experienced at cutting

31:47.697 --> 31:50.950
leaving something called hesitation marks.

31:51.034 --> 31:54.203
You'll see a slice
and then maybe a deeper slice.

31:54.287 --> 31:58.041
They're trying to get a feel
for how difficult it is.

32:00.585 --> 32:04.130
But the killer…
did not seem squeamish at all.

32:05.423 --> 32:07.425
He cut right in and kept on cutting.

32:09.510 --> 32:13.056
This tells us
that this individual felt very confident

32:13.139 --> 32:14.766
about what he was doing.

32:17.769 --> 32:20.939
<i>The one thing we've got</i>
<i>is plenty of questions.</i>

32:21.731 --> 32:25.318
<i>We asked one of the medical examiners</i>
<i>who conducted the autopsies.</i>

32:25.401 --> 32:27.528
Was there any indication that this killer

32:27.612 --> 32:30.949
may have inflicted sadistic injuries
before he killed them?

32:31.032 --> 32:37.080
Yes, there…there were linear abrasions,
scratches all over the body.

32:37.163 --> 32:40.083
No obvious signs of struggle, and, uh,

32:40.166 --> 32:41.334
which appears strange.

32:41.417 --> 32:45.505
But there were-- There are a lot
of scratch marks on the body.

32:48.967 --> 32:52.136
There were puncture marks,
incise marks.

32:53.221 --> 32:56.224
One victim had been bound face down,

32:56.307 --> 33:00.561
and he had taken the blade
and gone up and down her back,

33:00.645 --> 33:03.314
elongated incised type wounds,

33:03.982 --> 33:06.359
and the other victim has similar wounds.

33:07.443 --> 33:08.528
They were torture marks.

33:08.611 --> 33:12.323
They were designed to cause pain,
repeated pain.

33:12.407 --> 33:14.742
Can you imagine your whole body being cut?

33:14.826 --> 33:18.746
And… and that's… that's what he was doing
over a period of three days.

33:21.499 --> 33:23.501
They had also been sexually assaulted.

33:25.336 --> 33:29.590
Deedeh Goodarzi was stabbed
through the back into the lung.

33:31.467 --> 33:35.096
The ME declares cause of death
as the stab wound.

33:36.389 --> 33:40.601
What they determined in time
was these women died at different times.

33:40.685 --> 33:44.522
So one endured witnessing
what had happened to the other.

33:49.360 --> 33:55.074
I had awful visions
of what could have happened in that room.

33:55.700 --> 33:58.619
Because the fire,
because the mutilation, the decapitation.

33:58.703 --> 34:00.621
All of it was…

34:01.622 --> 34:03.332
It was just awful.

34:11.049 --> 34:15.219
The behavior cried out that we're dealing
with a psychopathic sexual sadist.

34:17.430 --> 34:20.433
These people have a tendency

34:20.516 --> 34:24.687
to want to hurt and cause pain

34:24.771 --> 34:26.981
in order to get sexually satisfied.

34:28.149 --> 34:31.319
They're basically trying
to fulfill a fantasy.

34:31.903 --> 34:34.363
Usually, it goes back
to their early childhood.

34:35.531 --> 34:39.994
At first, they use pornography
to implement the fantasy.

34:42.330 --> 34:44.707
And like any other stimulant,

34:44.791 --> 34:46.584
what happens, it becomes addictive,

34:47.585 --> 34:48.878
and they want more of it.

34:49.712 --> 34:54.717
Ultimately, in the mind
of the psychopathic sexual sadist,

34:54.801 --> 34:59.472
at a certain point, you'll see these guys
they wanna actually get a real victim,

34:59.555 --> 35:03.267
but the victim is just a prop
to fulfill the fantasy.

35:03.351 --> 35:06.771
So there's no empathy.
All right, there's no remorse.

35:07.688 --> 35:11.025
There's no feeling. There's no connection
that there's another human being there.

35:13.820 --> 35:19.784
There is this struggle
to transform one's fantasy into reality

35:19.867 --> 35:25.248
and… do it in a way
that's as perfect as the fantasy.

35:25.832 --> 35:26.958
And it never is.

35:28.376 --> 35:30.503
You ever hear
of the psychology of evil?

35:30.586 --> 35:33.840
That's what we're talking about here.
The psychology of evil.

35:35.842 --> 35:38.678
But if you're a true
psychopathic sexual sadist,

35:39.720 --> 35:40.972
you can fool people.

35:42.431 --> 35:44.392
They can present as "normal"

35:45.143 --> 35:48.521
to their neighbors, relatives,
and co-workers…

35:51.232 --> 35:54.527
because they've been able
to compartmentalize that evil.

36:15.214 --> 36:18.384
Back then,
I was working on 3rd Avenue…

36:20.386 --> 36:24.807
not far from the bright lights
of Times Square.

36:27.185 --> 36:31.731
I worked at Blue Cross Blue Shield
on a Honeywell H8200 computer.

36:32.648 --> 36:37.111
H8200 is about the size
of one floor of an office building.

36:38.112 --> 36:41.115
-I sat there with a bunch of engineers.

36:41.824 --> 36:44.911
They loved to brag about adventures

36:46.370 --> 36:48.164
like most guys do at work.

36:51.375 --> 36:53.127
There was one guy,

36:53.961 --> 36:56.172
most of the people called him Richie.

36:58.299 --> 36:59.926
His last name was Cottingham,

37:00.009 --> 37:03.638
so instead of saying that long word,
I used to call him "the Cott."

37:06.641 --> 37:09.936
He talked a lot about prowling
the streets of Times Square,

37:10.686 --> 37:12.438
picking up prostitutes.

37:14.190 --> 37:17.068
He had endless energy
when it came to that.

37:20.655 --> 37:24.867
I can't tell you
what I had for breakfast yesterday,

37:26.619 --> 37:28.955
but I could remember
everything about this man.

37:33.918 --> 37:37.880
Times Square
was attractive to Richie because

37:39.423 --> 37:44.428
all these extracurricular activities
was all in one place.

37:46.347 --> 37:49.475
His shift was from 4:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.

37:51.227 --> 37:52.728
It was a skeleton crew,

37:52.812 --> 37:55.523
so no one cared about
what we did on our shift.

37:58.276 --> 37:59.986
If you wanted to take a hike,

38:00.653 --> 38:03.489
kill a couple hours
in all these massage parlors,

38:03.572 --> 38:08.160
or the film pornography,
live pornography peep show places,

38:08.744 --> 38:10.329
he could get away with it.

38:15.418 --> 38:17.545
He would give you
a detailed map

38:17.628 --> 38:20.214
if you wanted to know
where the girls were.

38:21.132 --> 38:24.176
He was like a… a tour guide for hookers.

38:26.304 --> 38:30.683
The thing that'd draw
the women to him was C-A-S-H.

38:30.766 --> 38:32.935
Cash, lots of cash.

38:35.187 --> 38:40.234
Richard, at any time, would have two
or three thousand dollars in each pocket.

38:41.068 --> 38:42.361
And he waved it around.

38:42.445 --> 38:44.238
He made sure you… you saw it.

38:46.574 --> 38:48.200
He bought what he wanted.

38:50.369 --> 38:53.664
He said, "If I pay a girl,
she's gonna do anything I tell her to do."

38:57.043 --> 38:59.837
Richie talked a lot about Plato's Retreat,

39:00.963 --> 39:03.299
the swing club right off Times Square.

39:06.344 --> 39:10.931
So as a photographer,
as a journalist, there were places that

39:11.766 --> 39:14.310
I would go to on my own

39:15.019 --> 39:17.313
just because I was very curious.

39:18.230 --> 39:21.692
I was there with a camera.
I… I got a lot of great photos.

39:23.819 --> 39:27.865
Plato's Retreat was a place
that, uh, couples could go

39:27.948 --> 39:29.825
and swap partners with other couples,

39:29.909 --> 39:33.954
or even engage in, uh, group sex

39:34.038 --> 39:36.040
in what they called the orgy room.

39:36.791 --> 39:39.752
There were cubicles which were private.

39:39.835 --> 39:41.462
You know, lock the door.

39:41.545 --> 39:43.589
You don't know what people
are doing in there.

39:45.341 --> 39:48.427
Plato's Retreat is more than just a club.
It's an institution.

39:50.638 --> 39:52.473
It's a monument to sexual freedom.

39:54.975 --> 39:56.477
It was just, uh…

39:56.977 --> 40:00.731
a sewer of, uh… sexuality.

40:01.857 --> 40:07.405
Richard would talk about
how easy women were to get into bed.

40:08.739 --> 40:13.452
Everyone there
was fascinated with, uh, with sex.

40:14.578 --> 40:20.543
There was an open almost exchange
of, uh, sex acts and, uh, behavior.

40:22.169 --> 40:24.755
Plato's attracted a crowd,

40:25.631 --> 40:26.757
a lot of women…

40:29.552 --> 40:31.095
and a lot of sex workers.

40:34.932 --> 40:37.643
This includes, uh, incidentally…

40:40.104 --> 40:41.397
Deedeh Goodarzi,

40:42.148 --> 40:45.109
one of the victims at the Travel Inn.

40:59.290 --> 41:02.460
Now it's May 15th
in New York City,

41:02.543 --> 41:04.795
and the firefighters are once again called

41:04.879 --> 41:07.256
to a hotel, the Hotel Seville.

41:09.133 --> 41:12.386
It was right off Madison Avenue
and 29th Street,

41:12.470 --> 41:14.138
which is east of Times Square.

41:16.056 --> 41:18.267
The police were called,
detectives responded,

41:18.350 --> 41:20.227
Manhattan South Homicide responded.

41:24.523 --> 41:26.484
There was a room set on fire.

41:30.362 --> 41:32.448
And when they went inside…

41:36.243 --> 41:38.162
there's another mutilated woman.

41:45.252 --> 41:46.795
She was found beaten…

41:48.672 --> 41:51.008
tortured, naked,

41:52.551 --> 41:53.886
sexually assaulted…

41:56.055 --> 41:57.389
strangled to death.

42:02.728 --> 42:03.854
Once again,

42:04.813 --> 42:07.274
it looked like
a psychopathic sexual sadist.

42:08.734 --> 42:11.820
But in this case,
the heads and hands were not taken.

42:14.114 --> 42:16.534
But instead, he removed both her breasts

42:16.617 --> 42:18.744
and placed them on the headboard

42:19.453 --> 42:20.704
for shock value.

42:23.040 --> 42:26.085
Once again,
looking at the crime scene,

42:26.835 --> 42:29.046
it was very neat.

42:30.422 --> 42:32.508
There was no evidence.

42:34.009 --> 42:36.512
But this time, the hands,

42:36.595 --> 42:38.180
they were left behind

42:38.889 --> 42:42.142
so they could be used for fingerprints.

42:46.397 --> 42:48.983
She was identified
as Jean Ann Reyner.

42:50.025 --> 42:52.027
She had been arrested for prostitution,

42:52.570 --> 42:55.030
ironically just a couple of weeks before.

42:59.493 --> 43:03.581
Jean Reyner was… a young mother.

43:03.664 --> 43:06.875
She was a daughter. She was a sister.

43:07.543 --> 43:13.507
She… was killed horrifically,
leaving behind a small boy.

43:15.884 --> 43:18.470
She was working
as a sex worker

43:19.305 --> 43:23.851
essentially to finance
a custody suit she had

43:24.560 --> 43:26.687
to retain custody of her son.

43:27.271 --> 43:29.189
That's about all we know about her.

43:32.192 --> 43:35.613
When you compare
the presentation of the crime scene

43:35.696 --> 43:36.822
to the Travel Inn,

43:36.905 --> 43:39.283
and the type of injuries to the body,

43:39.992 --> 43:42.995
you'd have no doubt
they were inflicted by the same person.

43:45.039 --> 43:48.917
Also, the fact that you're looking
at another prostitute getting killed.

43:51.253 --> 43:54.465
As a profiler, that says one thing.

43:55.799 --> 43:57.885
I got a serial killer. That's it.

44:03.098 --> 44:06.685
The Hotel Seville
was not that far from work.

44:08.520 --> 44:11.065
We called it "slaughter at the Seville."

44:12.483 --> 44:14.360
And that's exactly what it was.

44:16.654 --> 44:20.491
One morning,
Richard and I were sitting at the console,

44:21.950 --> 44:24.787
and Cottingham
was in his chair rocking away,

44:25.371 --> 44:29.041
and one of our peripheral operators
came in, Bob,

44:29.124 --> 44:32.670
with the newspaper in his hand,
and it was on the front page.

44:34.338 --> 44:37.007
And Bob threw it down
on the console and said,

44:37.091 --> 44:40.844
"What sick son of a bitch
could do something like this?"

44:41.512 --> 44:44.306
Cottingham's rocking back and forth
in his chair,

44:44.932 --> 44:47.601
and he looked up at Bob,
and he said, "Bob,

44:48.185 --> 44:50.396
could've been you, could've been me."
