WEBVTT

00:00.408 --> 00:03.405
- Previously on "The Catch"...
- I'm sorry, but we can't do this.

00:03.542 --> 00:06.305
- It's not good for me.
- Is the Christopher thing taking over?

00:06.339 --> 00:08.207
- A little.
- Call my therapist.

00:08.241 --> 00:09.975
You are trying to make this a thing,

00:10.010 --> 00:11.343
and this ain't a thing.

00:11.378 --> 00:13.546
This was rebound sex.

00:13.580 --> 00:15.815
How does one man outsmart us?

00:15.849 --> 00:17.383
I think he's part of something bigger.

00:17.417 --> 00:19.051
They're called the Kensington Firm.

00:19.085 --> 00:21.387
They've been operating out
of London since the '50s.

00:21.421 --> 00:23.622
You are now looking
at the proud new co-owner

00:23.657 --> 00:25.624
of every Weatherby hotel in the country.

00:25.659 --> 00:28.394
The Kensington Firm is now
expanded into North America

00:28.428 --> 00:29.962
But the U.S. is my territory.

00:29.996 --> 00:31.564
Was your territory.

00:31.598 --> 00:35.301
Alice Vaughan is the one who
cost you America and Benji.

00:35.335 --> 00:37.002
Tell me about the Kensington Firm.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.037
What are you doing?

00:38.071 --> 00:40.031
You're on their side, you're
going down with them.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.373
Pick a side.

00:41.408 --> 00:43.475
Until you do, we're done.

00:43.510 --> 00:45.377
I got a referral from your therapist.

00:45.412 --> 00:46.579
Jessica Philips, MFT.

00:46.613 --> 00:48.147
Don't hold anything back.

00:48.181 --> 00:49.481
I could use some help.

00:49.516 --> 00:51.383
Tell me everything.

00:52.919 --> 00:54.320
She was his mark.

00:54.354 --> 00:56.355
He was pretending to be in
love with her for a year

00:56.389 --> 00:59.024
so that we could get
close to her clients.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.393
I guess he wasn't pretending.

01:01.428 --> 01:03.195
I am sorry, sis.

01:03.230 --> 01:04.930
No, you're not.

01:04.965 --> 01:07.600
You're just trying to
distract me so I won't hit you back.

01:07.634 --> 01:09.268
Oh, please. You've got no capital.

01:09.302 --> 01:11.670
You've got no infrastructure...

01:11.705 --> 01:14.707
- and now you've got no Benji.
- All right, enough. Get out.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.275
All right, look.

01:16.309 --> 01:20.846
Alice Vaughan is a
problem for both of us.

01:20.881 --> 01:22.348
If he's told her about you,

01:22.382 --> 01:24.617
he's told her about me and the firm.

01:24.651 --> 01:26.285
We have to deal with her.

01:26.319 --> 01:28.587
You want to kill her? Be my guest.

01:28.622 --> 01:31.457
See if your precious
Benji comes back to you then.

01:31.491 --> 01:33.192
Or were you hoping that I would do it

01:33.226 --> 01:34.760
and then he'd hate me and not you?

01:37.998 --> 01:39.899
- Are you gonna tell him?
- He'd only warn her.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.901
I have to find out what she knows.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.969
I've done some online reconnaissance

01:44.004 --> 01:45.537
and found that Alice Vaughan

01:45.572 --> 01:48.240
has her very first
therapy appointment this week.

01:48.275 --> 01:51.277
So, I'll pay a visit to her therapist.

01:51.311 --> 01:54.146
I'll make her a very persuasive offer.

01:54.180 --> 01:57.316
And then, when Alice arrives...

01:57.350 --> 01:58.717
Alice Vaughan?

01:59.953 --> 02:01.420
Jessie Phillips.

02:01.454 --> 02:02.488
Please come in.

02:08.428 --> 02:11.463
So, the man you were supposed to marry

02:11.498 --> 02:16.101
stole everything from
you and then disappeared?

02:18.171 --> 02:20.839
Until...

02:20.874 --> 02:23.609
I found him again.

02:23.643 --> 02:27.379
And how did that happen?

02:31.851 --> 02:35.254
I, um...

02:35.288 --> 02:40.359
started working with
the FBI to find him.

02:40.393 --> 02:43.262
And when I finally did...

02:47.334 --> 02:50.869
he told me it was real...

02:50.904 --> 02:54.173
that what we had was real.

02:58.411 --> 03:01.647
And I know he can't be trusted,

03:01.681 --> 03:03.716
but...

03:03.750 --> 03:06.085
Have you seen him since?

03:10.557 --> 03:12.358
I haven't told anyone.

03:15.395 --> 03:17.529
Are you sleeping with him?

03:19.000 --> 03:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:29.409 --> 03:33.379
He wants me to run away with him.

03:33.413 --> 03:36.448
And that's why I'm here.

03:40.787 --> 03:44.089
Because part of me really
wants to do it.

03:44.124 --> 03:46.258
Well, don't worry.

03:46.292 --> 03:47.893
I won't let you.

04:00.140 --> 04:02.875
I know... you said no
more showing up unannounced.

04:02.909 --> 04:03.749
Yeah, and I meant it.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.544
But you also said not to call, so...

04:05.578 --> 04:07.913
Are you here to help me take
down the Kensington Firm?

04:07.947 --> 04:09.448
No.

04:09.482 --> 04:10.416
Then you can't be here.

04:10.450 --> 04:12.051
I am here to show you why

04:12.085 --> 04:14.253
you can't take down the Kensington Firm.

04:14.287 --> 04:18.123
Drugs, arson, arms trading, murder.

04:22.652 --> 04:24.452
These are the people you're loyal to?

04:24.487 --> 04:26.354
These are the people who own me.

04:26.389 --> 04:27.622
These are the people

04:27.657 --> 04:28.923
with whom I got into business

04:28.958 --> 04:30.091
before I knew any better.

04:30.126 --> 04:33.862
And now that I do...

04:33.896 --> 04:35.830
I am afraid for you.

04:37.166 --> 04:38.533
Thank you.

04:38.567 --> 04:41.836
These will be very helpful.

04:41.871 --> 04:44.673
- Allie, I couldn't be more...
- Look, I believe you.

04:46.142 --> 04:50.045
Which is why I had Agent
Shawn give me this,

04:50.079 --> 04:52.213
which I promise I will not hesitate

04:52.248 --> 04:54.282
to use on anyone who threatens me

04:54.317 --> 04:56.918
or comes into my house uninvited.

05:07.730 --> 05:10.832
Please, don't do this.

05:10.866 --> 05:14.803
If you're not gonna
help me, you have to go.

05:27.783 --> 05:29.517
Why are you so determined

05:29.552 --> 05:31.753
to get me out of Los
Angeles all of a sudden?

05:31.787 --> 05:33.900
I mean, are you tired of me?

05:33.901 --> 05:35.016
Am I that terrible?

05:35.159 --> 05:36.925
No, I'm just saying I'm happy
to look after your interests here

05:36.959 --> 05:38.893
if you'd prefer to go
back home to London.

05:38.928 --> 05:41.062
Wait, so...

05:41.097 --> 05:43.865
you'd be willing to
come back to the firm?

05:43.899 --> 05:46.901
I would.

05:48.804 --> 05:50.405
How does my sister feel about this?

05:50.439 --> 05:52.340
Is she part of the package?

05:52.375 --> 05:54.109
Well, I haven't
discussed it with her yet,

05:54.143 --> 05:55.744
but I was thinking why not have Margot

05:55.778 --> 05:57.846
take over the East
Coast operations for the firm?

05:57.880 --> 06:00.548
Ah.

06:00.583 --> 06:03.118
I see... you want to get me out of town.

06:03.152 --> 06:05.920
You want to get her out so you can spend

06:05.955 --> 06:08.022
more nights with... what was her name?

06:08.057 --> 06:10.125
- You never said.
- We're not seeing each other anymore.

06:10.159 --> 06:13.361
Oh, you all right?

06:13.396 --> 06:15.964
Maybe I should stick
around... you know, cheer you up a bit,

06:15.998 --> 06:18.566
get Bad Benji back out to play.

06:18.601 --> 06:21.469
I think I'll be all right.

06:21.504 --> 06:22.804
What do you say? Do we have a deal?

06:22.838 --> 06:27.242
Well... let's ask Margot first.

06:27.276 --> 06:30.211
And then, if you're still alive,

06:30.246 --> 06:31.980
you tell me whether we have a deal.

06:48.964 --> 06:51.599
Alice, Kelsey's here.

06:51.634 --> 06:53.301
Okay.

07:01.377 --> 07:03.845
So, how do you guys know each other?

07:03.879 --> 07:04.946
Me and Sophie?

07:04.980 --> 07:06.948
I was a total fangirl.

07:06.982 --> 07:08.483
Of...?

07:08.517 --> 07:10.151
Sophie's.

07:10.186 --> 07:11.486
Do they not know?

07:11.520 --> 07:13.922
She's a ridiculous singer.

07:13.956 --> 07:15.256
What?

07:15.291 --> 07:17.358
- Okay.
- We used to be in a band together.

07:17.393 --> 07:18.159
You were in a band?

07:18.194 --> 07:20.028
There are videos I will show you.

07:20.062 --> 07:21.763
Okay, you're putting that away.

07:21.797 --> 07:23.298
- Why?
- But they're adorable.

07:23.332 --> 07:24.466
It was a long time ago.

07:24.500 --> 07:27.001
There was a ukulele
involved, and that's all I'll say.

07:27.036 --> 07:27.902
What was the name of the band?

07:27.937 --> 07:30.472
May I walk you to the conference room?

07:30.506 --> 07:32.974
I should never have signed the contract.

07:33.008 --> 07:34.008
Sophie told me not to.

07:34.043 --> 07:35.176
I didn't tell you not to.

07:35.211 --> 07:36.077
I just said

07:36.111 --> 07:37.846
you're basically signing your life away

07:37.880 --> 07:38.913
and making no money.

07:38.948 --> 07:41.850
It's a standard major-label
recording contract.

07:41.884 --> 07:43.384
So, why sign with a major label?

07:43.419 --> 07:45.487
Because they spend
millions promoting the record.

07:45.521 --> 07:48.723
And because they hooked
me up with Nathan Ashmore.

07:48.757 --> 07:51.226
- Nathan Ashmore?
- The songwriter-producer.

07:51.260 --> 07:53.161
He's a pop genius.

07:53.195 --> 07:55.864
He's a one-man
Beatles, a one-man ABBA.

07:55.898 --> 07:58.500
Did you just put ABBA on the
same level as the Beatles?

07:58.534 --> 08:00.034
He writes nothing but hits.

08:00.069 --> 08:01.970
And he saved my life.

08:02.004 --> 08:04.056
My boyfriend and I were broke.

08:04.057 --> 08:06.407
We had nowhere to live, and
he moved us into his studio,

08:06.442 --> 08:07.842
paid for everything,

08:07.877 --> 08:10.411
and we recorded an
awesome album together.

08:10.446 --> 08:12.246
So, then why do you
want out of your contract?

08:12.248 --> 08:14.649
Because PMG won't release it.

08:14.683 --> 08:17.185
- PMG is...
- The Panoply Music Group.

08:17.219 --> 08:19.754
Kelsey has a seven-album
deal with Nathan,

08:19.788 --> 08:21.689
but Nathan's deal is with PMG.

08:21.724 --> 08:23.858
And I can't spend the rest of my life

08:23.893 --> 08:27.028
making albums with
Nathan that PMG won't put out.

08:27.062 --> 08:29.230
Did they say why they won't release it?

08:29.265 --> 08:31.032
No, they won't even tell Nathan.

08:31.066 --> 08:34.068
So, let us find out for you.

08:34.102 --> 08:35.336
You would do that?

08:35.371 --> 08:38.039
For a friend of Sophie's? Absolutely.

08:50.719 --> 08:51.920
Margot?

08:58.827 --> 09:00.428
Are you all right?

09:03.599 --> 09:06.067
I've been calling.

09:06.101 --> 09:08.002
'Cause you're worried about me?

09:12.007 --> 09:14.776
You talked to Rhys, didn't you?

09:14.810 --> 09:18.112
Look, I know you're
upset, but the firm has resources

09:18.147 --> 09:21.449
we don't have... that we'll never have.

09:21.483 --> 09:23.451
So, why not team up with them again?

09:23.485 --> 09:24.886
What?

09:24.920 --> 09:27.088
Just hear me out. He'd
go back to London.

09:27.122 --> 09:28.756
You'd take over the East Coast.

09:28.791 --> 09:30.758
I'd run the West.

09:30.793 --> 09:33.261
And we'd all get together for Christmas?

09:33.295 --> 09:35.005
Have you lost your mind?

09:35.123 --> 09:36.264
What's the alternative? We have nothing.

09:36.298 --> 09:38.766
- We're starting from nothing.
- And whose fault is that?

09:38.801 --> 09:42.170
Who let Alice Vaughan take
everything from us?

09:42.204 --> 09:45.340
And now you want to go running
off to work for my idiot brother

09:45.374 --> 09:47.408
so that you can stay in Los Angeles

09:47.443 --> 09:49.777
while I, what, disappear
off to New York?

09:49.812 --> 09:51.746
Tell me why.

09:53.849 --> 09:58.586
Tell me why you want me gone.

10:05.127 --> 10:07.428
What do you want?

10:07.463 --> 10:10.164
I want you gone.

10:12.234 --> 10:16.004
You and my brother deserve each other.

10:16.038 --> 10:19.707
You're not getting
rid of me that easily.

10:31.817 --> 10:36.379
So, just to be clear, you're
choosing me over Margot?

10:38.349 --> 10:39.783
This is massive, Benji.

10:39.817 --> 10:42.219
You're really back... for good?

10:42.253 --> 10:44.788
And there's no leaving this time.

10:44.822 --> 10:46.256
For good.

10:48.522 --> 10:49.793
- You'-re back in with Rhys?
- Not as my partner.

10:49.827 --> 10:51.428
- You're my partner.
- I'm not working for Rhys.

10:51.462 --> 10:53.597
- He doesn't even know my name.
- He knows your name.

10:53.631 --> 10:55.298
He just playfully chooses not to use it.

10:55.333 --> 10:57.100
Which is why I
choose not to work for him.

10:57.134 --> 10:58.501
And you're not gonna have to

10:58.536 --> 11:00.103
because he is going back to London.

11:00.137 --> 11:01.938
Oh, thank you, Lord!

11:01.973 --> 11:03.840
And you and I will be running

11:03.874 --> 11:06.843
the firm's L.A. office on our terms.

11:06.877 --> 11:08.812
We'll never have to see him.

11:08.846 --> 11:10.647
Rarely have to see him.

11:13.651 --> 11:15.518
What does Margot think about it?

11:15.553 --> 11:18.688
Rhys is going to offer her New York.

11:18.723 --> 11:20.323
Hopefully she'll take it.

11:21.993 --> 11:23.426
Wow.

11:23.461 --> 11:24.694
So, that's what this is.

11:24.729 --> 11:27.163
Rhys leaves, Margot leaves

11:27.198 --> 11:30.033
so you can play house with Little Red.

11:30.067 --> 11:31.167
Tell me I'm wrong.

11:33.404 --> 11:36.973
The truth is Alice and Agent
Dao decided to go after Rhys.

11:37.008 --> 11:38.208
- What?
- She thinks if she can

11:38.209 --> 11:39.442
put him away, then I have...

11:39.477 --> 11:41.811
Does she want to die?

11:41.846 --> 11:44.347
Which is why I will do whatever it takes

11:44.382 --> 11:45.949
to keep him away from her,

11:45.983 --> 11:50.153
even if it means
rejoining the firm... for now.

11:50.187 --> 11:52.622
For now.

11:54.425 --> 11:56.893
Ben, you know how these people are.

11:56.927 --> 12:01.331
You want to mortgage the
rest of your life for this woman?

12:01.365 --> 12:05.068
That's what she's doing for me.

12:05.102 --> 12:07.871
This is Rhys Spencer Griffiths.

12:07.905 --> 12:10.040
He's a person of interest in Interpol's

12:10.074 --> 12:12.542
ongoing investigation
of the Kensington Firm.

12:12.576 --> 12:14.744
He arrived in Los Angeles 10 days ago.

12:14.779 --> 12:15.879
What do we know about him?

12:15.913 --> 12:17.681
The heir to a textile fortune.

12:17.715 --> 12:19.849
He runs a massive import/export
business.

12:19.884 --> 12:22.552
Which would make a perfect
front for the Kensington Firm.

12:22.586 --> 12:25.055
You never looked into this guy?

12:25.089 --> 12:26.923
I wasn't
investigating the Kensington Firm.

12:26.957 --> 12:28.525
I was investigating Christopher Hall

12:28.559 --> 12:32.162
- for theft, fraud...
- And the murder of Nathalie Duchamp.

12:32.196 --> 12:34.564
I checked Rhys' passport.

12:34.598 --> 12:36.733
He was in Paris the day she was killed.

12:36.767 --> 12:39.769
And you told Val that the ballistics

12:39.804 --> 12:41.438
on the bullets that killed Mickey Shive

12:41.472 --> 12:43.039
were the same as those
that killed Nathalie.

12:43.074 --> 12:45.041
I know you don't want to believe
it was Christopher...

12:45.076 --> 12:47.777
If Christopher was a
murderer, I would be dead right now.

12:47.812 --> 12:52.349
Mickey Shive was killed the
day after Rhys got here.

12:52.383 --> 12:55.418
Do we know if Rhys is still here?

12:55.453 --> 12:56.519
No.

12:56.554 --> 12:59.022
I can't find any credit
cards... personal or corporate.

12:59.056 --> 13:00.190
There's no phone.

13:00.224 --> 13:02.559
I called his office in
London, but he's out of the country.

13:02.593 --> 13:04.227
I'll see what I can find out.

13:04.261 --> 13:06.029
Thank you.

13:08.065 --> 13:09.933
- Thank you for this.
- Mm-hmm.

13:11.902 --> 13:13.937
Thank you, Ms. Anderson.

13:22.480 --> 13:23.713
What was that?

13:23.748 --> 13:25.415
What?

13:25.449 --> 13:28.385
Are you and Dao...

13:28.419 --> 13:30.086
No.

13:31.155 --> 13:32.389
Oh, my God, no.

13:32.423 --> 13:33.957
That's too bad.

13:35.126 --> 13:37.127
I think he likes you.

13:46.103 --> 13:47.837
That's Kelsey and her boyfriend, Tyler.

13:47.872 --> 13:50.407
This is the video that
got over 3 million views

13:50.441 --> 13:52.976
and caught the
attention of Nathan Ashmore,

13:53.010 --> 13:53.977
hit maker, one-man ABBA,

13:54.011 --> 13:57.280
and owner of Kelsey's
label, Ashmore Records.

13:57.314 --> 13:59.082
You've seen Kelsey's
contract with Ashmore.

13:59.116 --> 14:01.584
Yeah, it's standard,
iron-clad... no way out.

14:01.619 --> 14:03.787
Unless we can prove that Nathan or PMG

14:03.821 --> 14:05.221
haven't been holding up their side.

14:05.222 --> 14:06.382
And what would that look like?

14:06.390 --> 14:09.025
Withholding royalties,
corporate or financial malfeasance.

14:09.059 --> 14:10.226
Is there any sign of malfeasance?

14:10.261 --> 14:12.796
- Please stop saying "malfeasance."
- It's all above-board.

14:12.830 --> 14:14.130
Everything was going great

14:14.165 --> 14:16.533
until PMG refused to release the record.

14:16.567 --> 14:18.168
And we still don't know why?

14:18.202 --> 14:21.171
Actually, I may have
disguised myself as a radio promoter

14:21.205 --> 14:22.537
and chatted up two very attractive

14:22.562 --> 14:23.640
- women at PMG.
- What?! When?!

14:23.674 --> 14:25.508
PMG said they never got Kelsey's record.

14:25.543 --> 14:28.278
- Nathan never sent over the masters.
- That's impossible.

14:28.312 --> 14:30.847
They said Nathan's still
working on one last recording.

14:30.881 --> 14:32.515
That's not true. The album's finished.

14:32.550 --> 14:34.484
- I've heard it.
- Unless Nathan's lying.

14:34.518 --> 14:36.219
How do we find out?

14:36.253 --> 14:39.789
We could send someone in undercover.

14:39.824 --> 14:43.059
I am talking about a young detective...

14:43.093 --> 14:47.163
one who also, apparently,
is a very talented singer.

14:50.334 --> 14:52.368
As I'm sure Kelsey's
already told you,

14:52.403 --> 14:55.572
we have artists here from New
York, Nashville, London.

14:55.606 --> 14:57.574
They'll stay a week, a month.

14:57.608 --> 14:59.843
Kelsey and Tyler have
been here for two years.

14:59.877 --> 15:02.145
Everyone works
together and writes together.

15:02.179 --> 15:04.481
It's like a year-round writing camp.

15:04.515 --> 15:05.682
Or an assembly line.

15:05.716 --> 15:07.250
Well, it's both, actually.

15:07.284 --> 15:09.552
We generate a lot of
material very quickly here.

15:09.587 --> 15:11.087
It's not for everyone, but...

15:11.121 --> 15:13.223
would that be
something you'd be interested in?

15:14.458 --> 15:17.060
Come on. You've seen the
videos. Tell her how great she is.

15:17.094 --> 15:20.230
Well, actually, she won't
let me see any of them.

15:20.264 --> 15:21.431
Do you have them on your laptop?

15:21.465 --> 15:23.066
Those videos are ancient,

15:23.100 --> 15:26.536
but I could send you some work tapes.

15:29.640 --> 15:31.774
So, can I ask, where did you find

15:31.809 --> 15:33.743
those lyrics to "Blue Moon"?

15:33.777 --> 15:37.113
Well, that song had
like four different versions

15:37.147 --> 15:38.187
before it was "Blue Moon."

15:38.215 --> 15:40.083
But then there's this
mysterious intro verse...

15:40.117 --> 15:41.584
From the Greta Keller version.

15:41.619 --> 15:43.887
How do you know Greta Keller?

15:43.921 --> 15:45.922
- Who is Greta Keller?
- Oh, man.

15:45.956 --> 15:48.258
Greta Keller was a kind
of proto-Marlene Dietrich,

15:48.292 --> 15:49.626
you know, musically.

15:49.660 --> 15:51.794
Wow, I thought you were just a pop guy.

15:51.829 --> 15:53.363
I am. Rodgers and Hart is pop.

15:53.397 --> 15:55.164
It doesn't get much better than that.

15:58.836 --> 16:00.603
So, after he left you,

16:00.638 --> 16:03.273
after he took your
money and disappeared,

16:03.307 --> 16:06.409
when was the next time that you saw him?

16:08.612 --> 16:10.280
The next day.

16:12.316 --> 16:15.552
I knew he'd try to steal the device

16:15.586 --> 16:17.487
from a client of mine, so I rigged it

16:17.521 --> 16:19.556
to take back the money he had stolen.

16:20.858 --> 16:22.625
- We just got conned.
- How?

16:22.660 --> 16:24.928
I have no idea.

16:24.962 --> 16:27.897
And did you speak to him?

16:27.932 --> 16:30.300
No.

16:30.334 --> 16:31.601
He called me.

16:33.170 --> 16:35.572
But we didn't talk face-to-face until...

16:35.606 --> 16:37.507
Paige Baker, I'd like for you to meet...

16:37.541 --> 16:38.575
Michael Thorne.

16:38.609 --> 16:42.078
I was wearing a wire, hoping
to get a confession.

16:42.112 --> 16:44.280
And what did he tell you?

16:46.850 --> 16:49.252
And I love you.

16:49.286 --> 16:50.887
Nothing else matters.

16:52.389 --> 16:55.291
That he loves me.

16:55.326 --> 16:56.926
And then he returned the money

16:56.961 --> 16:58.828
he'd stolen from a Kuroqi princess.

16:58.862 --> 17:01.264
I don't
suppose she gave you a check.

17:01.298 --> 17:03.800
- She did.
- But her brother froze the account?

17:05.301 --> 17:07.837
So, um, has he reformed?

17:07.871 --> 17:10.106
No.

17:10.140 --> 17:11.674
He stole a diamond bracelet,

17:11.709 --> 17:14.010
which then I stole back from him.

17:14.044 --> 17:16.878
- You stole?
- I'm doing things that I shouldn't.

17:16.914 --> 17:19.449
I'm lying to everyone in my life.

17:19.483 --> 17:22.018
The fact is...

17:22.051 --> 17:24.153
Ben is a criminal.

17:28.425 --> 17:30.159
I need to put him away.

17:32.262 --> 17:34.330
Him and the people he works with.

17:40.471 --> 17:41.971
Benji.

17:42.006 --> 17:43.446
- What's he doing here?
- You called.

17:43.474 --> 17:44.574
You said you had a job for us.

17:44.608 --> 17:47.210
- Yeah, us... me and you.
- Rhys, Reggie's my partner.

17:47.244 --> 17:48.892
- This is a two-man job.
- So, let us do the

17:48.917 --> 17:50.380
job, and you can go back to London.

17:50.414 --> 17:52.315
Wait... you said he was
going back to London, right?

17:52.349 --> 17:53.316
He's talking. Why is he talking?

17:53.350 --> 17:54.784
What's the job?

17:56.654 --> 17:59.222
I've gone to a great
deal of expense and trouble

17:59.256 --> 18:01.090
to have a package
delivered to the hotel.

18:01.125 --> 18:03.245
- We're going to steal it.
- We're gonna steal a package

18:03.260 --> 18:04.661
you're having delivered to the hotel?

18:04.695 --> 18:06.062
Now he's just repeating what I'm saying.

18:06.096 --> 18:07.297
- Why is he doing that?
- What is this package?

18:07.331 --> 18:09.332
- Cash? I.P.?
- Drugs? Guns? What?

18:09.366 --> 18:11.401
The package is an investment

18:11.435 --> 18:13.803
which will yield unlimited returns.

18:13.837 --> 18:15.004
It's like talking to the Riddler.

18:15.039 --> 18:17.307
Rhys, what is the package?

18:17.341 --> 18:18.808
It's not "what." It's "who."

18:22.179 --> 18:25.114
We're going to steal her.

18:32.289 --> 18:34.357
So, maybe it's different in England,

18:34.391 --> 18:37.293
but that was a person, not a package.

18:37.328 --> 18:41.264
Yeah, well, "package" was
code, and stealing is stealing.

18:41.298 --> 18:44.033
Except when you steal a
person. That is called abduction.

18:44.068 --> 18:47.136
- And we're not kidnappers.
- How do you know unless you've tried?

18:47.171 --> 18:49.505
- Rhys, who is the woman?
- She's a very important artist.

18:49.540 --> 18:51.808
- Her name is Leah Wells.
- Why is she in handcuffs?

18:51.842 --> 18:53.356
- And why the U.S. Marshals?
- Because

18:53.381 --> 18:54.611
the American justice system

18:54.645 --> 18:58.481
doesn't appreciate fine art.

18:58.515 --> 19:00.950
She's a counterfeiter.

19:00.985 --> 19:02.552
She's an artist.

19:02.586 --> 19:04.787
She's the best in the business.

19:04.822 --> 19:06.522
And the reason she's at
the Weatherby is because

19:06.557 --> 19:08.291
she's made a deal with
the feds to testify

19:08.325 --> 19:10.994
against her old boss, Jordan Hamlin.

19:11.028 --> 19:13.162
She's rolling on
the head of the Hamlin clan?

19:13.197 --> 19:15.365
So not only do we have to
get her away from the Feds,

19:15.399 --> 19:17.200
we have to do it before the
Hamlins try to kill her.

19:17.234 --> 19:18.468
Or kill us.

19:18.502 --> 19:20.336
That's the plan.

19:20.371 --> 19:22.038
Any objections?

19:22.072 --> 19:23.906
- That plan is gonna get us all killed.
- The plan is to call Margot

19:23.941 --> 19:25.808
- and beg her to come up with a plan.
- It's gonna land us in prison.

19:25.843 --> 19:26.825
We need some time to research and recon.

19:26.850 --> 19:27.543
Clearly, professionalism...

19:27.578 --> 19:28.495
that is a recessive gene in your family.

19:28.520 --> 19:29.479
We can't just
improvise this sort of thing.

19:29.513 --> 19:30.713
- Excellent.
- You have to have some finesse.

19:30.748 --> 19:32.181
Well, that's settled, then.

19:34.852 --> 19:36.586
West Umberland Incorporated.

19:36.620 --> 19:38.655
That's Rhys Griffiths' shell company.

19:38.689 --> 19:40.323
I traced his credit cards.

19:40.357 --> 19:42.358
He's staying at the Weatherby Hotel.

19:42.393 --> 19:44.160
You couldn't have
called to tell us that?

19:44.194 --> 19:45.834
Then I wouldn't have
been able to see you.

19:49.266 --> 19:51.567
- Have lunch with me.
- No.

19:51.602 --> 19:52.944
- I told you...
- Having lunch

19:52.969 --> 19:54.337
doesn't make it a thing.

19:54.371 --> 19:56.339
Having dinner makes it a thing.

19:56.373 --> 19:59.375
Or we could just go back
to having meaningless sex.

19:59.410 --> 20:01.177
- I'm fine with that.
- Allie.

20:03.614 --> 20:06.449
Agent Dao found Rhys Griffiths.

20:06.483 --> 20:08.184
At the Weatherby Hotel.

20:08.218 --> 20:09.452
At the Weatherby?

20:09.486 --> 20:11.287
That's where we found Princess Zara.

20:11.321 --> 20:12.422
Can't be a coincidence.

20:12.456 --> 20:14.057
I have agents at the hotel.

20:14.091 --> 20:15.591
One misstep, and we'll bring him in.

20:15.626 --> 20:17.794
I'll, uh, let you two...

20:17.828 --> 20:19.729
- No, that's it. We're done.
- That's all I came to say.

20:27.604 --> 20:29.972
I'm not even looking at you right now.

20:30.007 --> 20:32.742
Not even looking.

20:34.578 --> 20:36.446
What? What happened?

20:36.480 --> 20:38.448
Nothing on Nathan's hard drive?

20:38.482 --> 20:40.383
- There were e-mails.
- And contracts.

20:40.417 --> 20:42.485
Nathan's contract with PMG?

20:42.519 --> 20:45.455
Nathan's contract with
Insindiary Entertainment.

20:45.489 --> 20:46.409
They're a porn company.

20:46.423 --> 20:48.591
They specialize in celebrity sex tapes.

20:48.625 --> 20:50.893
Nathan told PMG he was still working

20:50.928 --> 20:52.662
on a final recording with Kelsey.

20:52.696 --> 20:54.464
I think we know what it is.

20:57.101 --> 20:59.068
You filmed me having sex?!

20:59.103 --> 21:00.403
Kelsey, let's
get you out of here.

21:00.437 --> 21:01.938
Uh, hey, guys can we
have the room, please?

21:01.972 --> 21:03.473
You put a camera in my
room... in all our rooms...

21:03.507 --> 21:05.508
and you sold the footage.

21:05.542 --> 21:06.943
- Yes, I did.
- Kelsey, come on.

21:06.977 --> 21:08.344
And all the profits will go

21:08.378 --> 21:10.313
to recouping the cost of your record.

21:10.347 --> 21:11.547
Kelsey, I'm trying to help you.

21:11.548 --> 21:12.682
You've helped enough, Mr. Ashmore.

21:12.716 --> 21:14.650
We made a great record,

21:14.685 --> 21:16.819
but it's not enough anymore, Kels.

21:16.854 --> 21:17.954
You need some kind of a story,

21:17.988 --> 21:20.456
and the minute that TMZ
shows clips from that tape,

21:20.491 --> 21:22.811
I promise you, you will be the
biggest artist in the world.

21:22.826 --> 21:26.162
- For about 10 seconds.
- It only takes one, pal.

21:26.196 --> 21:28.364
They're gonna click on that
link, watch the footage,

21:28.398 --> 21:30.133
hear the record, and
they're gonna love it

21:30.167 --> 21:33.136
because it's great,
because you're great.

21:33.170 --> 21:34.704
But they're never gonna know that

21:34.738 --> 21:36.372
unless you've got their attention.

21:36.406 --> 21:39.342
And this is how you
get the world's attention.

21:39.376 --> 21:42.378
My parents are gonna see that tape.

21:42.412 --> 21:43.813
- Tyler's parents...
- No, they won't.

21:43.847 --> 21:45.481
We'll stop the release.

21:45.516 --> 21:47.183
You can't. I'm sorry.

21:47.217 --> 21:48.417
I just sent the link to TMZ.

21:48.452 --> 21:51.287
The record will be out and
number one on iTunes by midnight.

21:51.321 --> 21:52.555
I promise you.

21:52.589 --> 21:54.157
We'll file an injunction. We'll sue.

21:54.191 --> 21:55.892
You can, and it'll keep the story alive.

21:55.926 --> 21:57.646
It'll be great
publicity, but you won't win.

21:57.661 --> 21:59.862
Tyler and Kelsey signed contracts.
This is my studio.

21:59.897 --> 22:01.831
And everything that
happens in it belongs to me.

22:01.865 --> 22:04.967
I promise you, Kels,
at this time tomorrow,

22:05.002 --> 22:06.702
you will be thanking me.

22:11.508 --> 22:13.509
Our counterfeiter, Leah Wells,

22:13.544 --> 22:16.879
literally made money for
Jordan Hamlin for years.

22:16.914 --> 22:18.581
But did he appreciate her?

22:18.615 --> 22:20.183
Did he make her feel loved?

22:20.217 --> 22:21.884
- I'm guessing...
- He did not.

22:21.919 --> 22:25.254
In fact, he sold her out to the Feds,

22:25.289 --> 22:28.558
who then made a deal with
Leah to testify against Hamlin.

22:28.592 --> 22:30.359
So we're gonna make her a better deal.

22:30.394 --> 22:31.874
- We're gonna make her feel loved.
- How?

22:31.895 --> 22:33.695
She's got round-the-clock
U.S. Marshals on her

22:33.697 --> 22:35.498
to make sure that Hamlin's
team doesn't try and kill her.

22:35.532 --> 22:36.688
We're not getting anywhere

22:36.713 --> 22:38.067
- near Leah Wells.
- You're not.

22:38.101 --> 22:39.502
Benji is

22:39.536 --> 22:43.539
as Assistant U.S.
Attorney Terrence Davenport.

22:48.545 --> 22:51.514
At 5:30 p.m., Benji, as Davenport,

22:51.548 --> 22:54.217
will arrive outside Suite 638.

22:54.251 --> 22:55.952
I'm here to see the witness.

22:55.986 --> 22:57.887
He'll then request a little privacy

22:57.921 --> 22:59.789
with our favorite state's witness,

22:59.823 --> 23:01.424
and then you'll offer her the following.

23:01.458 --> 23:03.359
I can get you out of here.

23:03.393 --> 23:05.428
You just have to do exactly as I say.

23:05.462 --> 23:08.397
First of all, she must demand
a transfer to a different hotel

23:08.432 --> 23:10.733
because she's convinced
there are criminals here.

23:10.767 --> 23:13.469
Which, of course, there are.

23:13.503 --> 23:16.405
During the transfer, my
associates and I will intercept you.

23:16.440 --> 23:18.741
We'll protect you from
Hamlin's thugs, and we are prepared

23:18.775 --> 23:20.543
to offer you a very generous salary

23:20.577 --> 23:22.979
for your continued services.

23:23.013 --> 23:24.947
Oh, thank God.

23:24.982 --> 23:26.983
You have no idea.

23:27.017 --> 23:30.086
All I need is your
signature on this transfer request.

23:30.120 --> 23:32.822
You have no idea how screwed you are.

23:32.856 --> 23:34.425
- Excuse me?
- I could scream right now

23:34.450 --> 23:35.892
and have you arrested.

23:35.926 --> 23:39.061
In fact, it will probably
better my Witness Protection deal.

23:39.096 --> 23:40.496
You know where they're hiding me?

23:40.530 --> 23:41.631
- Iowa.
- Oh.

23:41.665 --> 23:44.233
I give them you, and I get the
beach house in Charleston.

23:44.268 --> 23:46.636
You know who they give the
beach house in Charleston to?

23:46.670 --> 23:48.070
- Nobody.
- Let's not be hasty.

23:48.105 --> 23:49.839
So, you can go back and
tell your associates

23:49.873 --> 23:51.941
if I'm gonna give up my beach
house in Charleston,

23:51.975 --> 23:53.442
I have a few demands of my own.

23:53.477 --> 23:55.077
You might want to write this down.

23:59.886 --> 24:02.034
You should know I'm in no
position to negotiate.

24:02.166 --> 24:05.022
Oh, that's good because my
terms are non-negotiable.

24:05.056 --> 24:07.791
First, I want 50% of the take.

24:07.826 --> 24:10.194
- What?
- Second, I want Jordan Hamlin dead.

24:10.228 --> 24:12.162
Assassinated, and you should, too.

24:12.197 --> 24:15.032
Because without my
testimony, he won't be in jail,

24:15.066 --> 24:17.534
which means he's
definitely gonna come after us.

24:17.569 --> 24:19.269
That's an excellent point.

24:19.304 --> 24:21.672
Third, I want Paul McCartney.

24:22.707 --> 24:24.107
Write it down.

24:24.142 --> 24:25.442
Paul McCartney?

24:25.477 --> 24:27.311
I could probably get Ringo in a push.

24:27.345 --> 24:29.346
He owes me a favor, but I
can't get Paul McCartney.

24:29.380 --> 24:31.648
I can't even get decent
tickets for Paul McCartney.

24:31.683 --> 24:33.183
She's not talking
about the Paul McCartney.

24:33.218 --> 24:34.384
She's talking about her dog.

24:34.419 --> 24:36.386
She named her dog Paul McCartney?

24:36.421 --> 24:37.654
- She did.
- She is mental.

24:37.689 --> 24:39.356
I got that feeling.

24:39.390 --> 24:42.359
All right, where's the bloody dog?

24:42.393 --> 24:44.795
Impounded by the FBI after
Leah was taken custody.

24:44.829 --> 24:46.036
So, he's at least local.

24:46.061 --> 24:47.364
Yeah, we can get him out no problem.

24:47.398 --> 24:48.198
The problem is, I'm not about

24:48.233 --> 24:50.067
to give that woman 50% of my take.

24:50.101 --> 24:52.636
Our take. We're
working together now, remember?

24:52.670 --> 24:54.304
Well, why don't you make yourself useful

24:54.339 --> 24:56.306
and go and assassinate Jordan
Hamlin for me, would you?

24:56.341 --> 25:00.010
Can we please just try to do
this without killing anybody?

25:00.044 --> 25:01.578
Is he still like this?

25:01.613 --> 25:03.680
- I know.
- Does he not know we're gangsters?

25:03.715 --> 25:05.516
Well, he has the whole
gentleman-bandit thing going on.

25:05.550 --> 25:07.518
- I know, it's ridiculous, isn't it?
- All right, all right.

25:07.552 --> 25:09.072
We need to find another counterfeiter.

25:09.087 --> 25:11.021
There is no other counterfeiter.

25:11.055 --> 25:12.823
Leah's product is undetectable.

25:12.857 --> 25:15.225
Then we need to figure out
a way around her conditions.

25:15.260 --> 25:18.228
All right.

25:18.263 --> 25:20.731
Leave it to me. I'll think of something.

25:20.765 --> 25:23.233
I'm not helping you with your con.

25:23.268 --> 25:24.735
I'm not asking for your help.

25:24.769 --> 25:26.436
But if I were...

25:26.471 --> 25:28.438
Oh, for Heaven's sakes, all
you have to do is get the dog.

25:28.473 --> 25:29.944
- What do you mean?
- The dog.

25:30.062 --> 25:31.341
You know how people
are about their animals.

25:31.376 --> 25:33.443
- You remember Whiskers.
- Oh, Whiskers.

25:33.478 --> 25:35.379
- I used to love Whiskers.
- Exactly.

25:35.413 --> 25:37.748
So, all you have to
do is get Paul McCartney

25:37.782 --> 25:39.783
and hold him hostage and lock him up

25:39.817 --> 25:42.553
until she caves on her other
demands, which she will.

25:44.389 --> 25:46.356
You are good, aren't you?

25:46.391 --> 25:48.692
Does this mean you're
gonna come back to work?

25:48.726 --> 25:50.427
- For you?
- For the firm.

25:50.461 --> 25:52.262
It's your family, as well, you know?

25:52.297 --> 25:53.764
Yeah, I'm not feeling very familial

25:53.798 --> 25:55.198
at the moment, about you or Ben.

25:55.233 --> 25:56.733
Oh.

25:59.137 --> 26:02.372
That because of Alice Vaughan?

26:02.407 --> 26:03.574
How is all that?

26:03.608 --> 26:06.076
Is she horrible?

26:06.110 --> 26:08.045
She is.

26:08.079 --> 26:10.480
She's beautiful.

26:10.515 --> 26:12.716
She's smart.

26:12.750 --> 26:16.954
She doesn't trust anyone or anything.

26:16.988 --> 26:19.990
And she's in love with Benjamin Jones.

26:20.024 --> 26:22.426
That sounds like someone we both know.

26:22.460 --> 26:23.727
No, no, you don't understand.

26:23.761 --> 26:25.495
She's not in love with Christopher Hall.

26:25.530 --> 26:28.165
She's in love with Benjamin Jones.

26:31.336 --> 26:33.837
He's told her his name?

26:33.871 --> 26:35.939
Bloody hell. What else has he told her?

26:35.974 --> 26:37.908
- We haven't got there yet.
- Why? What have you been doing?

26:37.942 --> 26:40.410
It's a delicate process.

26:40.445 --> 26:41.278
So you don't know anything?

26:41.312 --> 26:43.146
What I do know is that the entire time

26:43.181 --> 26:44.781
he was lying to her about what he was,

26:44.816 --> 26:47.417
he was also lying to me about the cons

26:47.452 --> 26:49.920
and the money and everything.

26:49.954 --> 26:52.522
Oh, that is bad because that means

26:52.557 --> 26:54.458
that Alice Vaughan is not the problem.

26:54.492 --> 26:59.229
The problem... is Benji.

27:06.638 --> 27:08.839
How many views since the release?

27:08.873 --> 27:10.507
4.4 million and climbing.

27:10.541 --> 27:12.376
How could we not have stopped this?

27:12.410 --> 27:14.277
We tried. I called TMZ, Insindiary.

27:14.312 --> 27:15.245
I begged. I threatened.

27:15.279 --> 27:17.047
Well, Nathan
didn't break any laws.

27:17.081 --> 27:18.815
He owns Kelsey's image and Tyler's,

27:18.850 --> 27:21.518
and the video was shot in
his studio with his cameras.

27:21.552 --> 27:23.320
It's technically a performance.

27:23.354 --> 27:25.722
- And it's selling through the roof.
- So is Kelsey's album.

27:25.757 --> 27:28.158
Nathan was right. His strategy worked.

27:28.192 --> 27:29.660
Everyone knows who she is now.

27:29.694 --> 27:31.728
- Is she okay?
- She turned off her phone.

27:31.763 --> 27:33.997
- She's not answering.
- Did you try Tyler?

27:34.032 --> 27:36.500
I texted and left messages, but...

27:36.534 --> 27:38.068
Guys, Kelsey just tweeted,

27:38.102 --> 27:40.137
"Taking matters into my own hands."

27:40.171 --> 27:41.345
That can't be good.

27:41.346 --> 27:42.606
She geo-tagged the
tweet. She's at Nathan's.

27:42.640 --> 27:44.480
We should get to her before
she gets to Nathan.

27:50.581 --> 27:51.848
Excuse me. Oh, my God.

27:51.883 --> 27:53.417
- Kelsey.
- Sophie!

27:53.451 --> 27:55.152
- What happened?
- I found her in the tub.

27:55.186 --> 27:55.986
- She O.D.'d.
- Nathan.

27:56.020 --> 27:57.554
- Oh, my God.
- You did this to her!

27:57.588 --> 27:59.489
- Tyler, don't!
- If she dies, you killed her!

27:59.524 --> 28:01.224
- Do not do it, Tyler.
- Don't do this.

28:01.259 --> 28:02.859
- Stop!
- Enough.

28:02.894 --> 28:05.095
Nathan, enough! Enough!

28:05.129 --> 28:06.997
Let go of me!

28:09.967 --> 28:11.435
Thank you, Ms. Vaughan.

28:11.469 --> 28:14.237
Imagine how many hits we're
gonna get on this video.

28:22.702 --> 28:24.265
Tonight, singer-songwriter
Kelsey Braddock

28:24.299 --> 28:27.801
has been hospitalized after
an alleged drug overdose.

28:27.836 --> 28:28.969
Kelsey's producer,

28:29.004 --> 28:30.938
Nathan Ashmore, had this to say.

28:30.972 --> 28:32.606
Kelsey and I would
like to thank her fans

28:32.641 --> 28:34.008
for their thoughts and
for their prayers,

28:34.042 --> 28:35.576
and she wants me to let you guys know

28:35.610 --> 28:37.244
that we will see you on
the road later this year

28:37.279 --> 28:38.679
to support her record.

28:38.713 --> 28:41.448
Did he just announce a tour?

28:41.483 --> 28:42.850
He did.

28:42.884 --> 28:44.852
How's Kelsey?

28:44.886 --> 28:46.787
They pumped her
stomach. Tyler's with her now.

28:46.821 --> 28:48.656
But the doctor said she's gonna be okay.

28:48.690 --> 28:51.592
No, she won't... not if she
has to keep working for Nathan.

28:57.065 --> 28:59.033
You say you're done with him,

28:59.067 --> 29:01.502
but you're still going
after the people he works with.

29:01.536 --> 29:04.138
Why? I mean, you got your money back.

29:04.172 --> 29:05.973
You got the answers
you were looking for.

29:06.007 --> 29:07.374
What do you want from them?

29:07.409 --> 29:10.010
I don't know.

29:10.045 --> 29:11.745
Justice?

29:14.883 --> 29:16.784
Revenge?

29:16.818 --> 29:19.687
It's probably not the
healthiest way of moving on.

29:24.693 --> 29:27.995
I should just let it go.

29:28.029 --> 29:30.864
I should just move on.

29:32.901 --> 29:36.170
But then there's some...

29:36.204 --> 29:39.239
tiny, terrible little piece of me

29:39.274 --> 29:45.079
that just needs to have
been right about him...

29:45.113 --> 29:48.916
that he actually is a good person,

29:48.950 --> 29:52.653
that he is that man I fell in love with.

29:52.687 --> 29:56.090
And that were it not for these
other people, he'd be that guy.

29:56.124 --> 29:58.926
We'd have a chance.

29:58.960 --> 30:01.261
And I wouldn't have
wasted a year of my life

30:01.296 --> 30:03.697
with somebody who... who didn't love me.

30:07.235 --> 30:10.904
I should just let him go.

30:10.939 --> 30:15.075
But then that terrible,
tiny, little piece of me

30:15.110 --> 30:18.011
just keeps asking, "What if...

30:18.046 --> 30:19.913
he's the love of my life?"

30:22.150 --> 30:23.751
I think the love of your life

30:23.785 --> 30:25.719
is always the love you can't have.

30:29.991 --> 30:33.694
Is that all this is...

30:33.728 --> 30:37.431
me just wanting what I can't have?

30:39.467 --> 30:42.436
How'd it go with Leah?

30:42.470 --> 30:45.038
- It worked, didn't it?
- Yeah, it worked.

30:45.073 --> 30:47.775
A brilliant solution, even
if I do say so myself.

30:47.809 --> 30:49.243
Well, if that's
what you want to call it.

30:49.277 --> 30:50.957
- Why, what would you call it?
- A new low.

30:59.687 --> 31:01.922
Sir Paul.

31:17.205 --> 31:18.972
She got the message.

31:19.007 --> 31:20.407
And the paperwork?

31:20.442 --> 31:23.110
She signed it the minute
she got back to her room.

31:23.144 --> 31:25.179
Her name is Leah Wells.

31:25.213 --> 31:26.373
So the Kensington Firm may be

31:26.381 --> 31:28.148
looking for a stateside counterfeiter.

31:28.183 --> 31:30.017
If they are, they'll
have to move quickly.

31:30.051 --> 31:31.418
Leah signed a transfer request.

31:31.453 --> 31:32.920
She's moving to a different hotel.

31:32.954 --> 31:34.321
She'll be on the move, out in the open.

31:34.355 --> 31:35.656
- He'll try to intercept.
- Mm.

31:35.690 --> 31:37.291
- If he does, I'll be there.
- We'll be there.

31:37.325 --> 31:38.425
We're doing this together.

31:38.460 --> 31:40.194
Ms. Vaughan, I strongly suggest...

31:40.228 --> 31:41.361
What time is the transfer?

31:41.396 --> 31:43.363
4:00.

31:43.398 --> 31:44.932
Then we'd better get going.

31:48.236 --> 31:50.904
You'd better get going.

32:07.922 --> 32:10.123
- We need to leave.
- How many agents?

32:10.158 --> 32:11.859
There's at least three
Feds, more on the way.

32:11.893 --> 32:13.994
- Then we go now.
- That's what I'm saying.

32:14.028 --> 32:14.862
No, I mean the job.

32:14.896 --> 32:17.231
We take Leah now, ahead of schedule.

32:17.265 --> 32:18.332
- Are you out of your mind?
- Yeah.

32:18.366 --> 32:20.801
You knew that, didn't you?

32:25.006 --> 32:25.873
This is a mistake.

32:25.907 --> 32:28.242
We've got two U.S.
Marshals on this floor,

32:28.276 --> 32:31.211
three Feds in the lobby, and
two more Marshals on the way.

32:33.615 --> 32:34.581
Well, this is a mistake.

32:34.616 --> 32:36.917
There should be two
Marshals outside Leah's door.

32:36.951 --> 32:38.485
Why is that door open?

32:43.291 --> 32:45.158
What the hell?

32:49.130 --> 32:50.497
They're alive.

32:50.532 --> 32:53.433
I'm guessing drugged.

32:53.468 --> 32:56.169
Never mind them. My
counterfeiter's gone.

32:56.204 --> 32:58.171
So are we.

33:00.275 --> 33:02.743
Room 638 is right this way.

33:09.150 --> 33:10.817
It's right there.

33:14.589 --> 33:16.857
FBI. Open the door.

33:20.995 --> 33:22.429
- No balcony.
- FBI. Open the door.

33:22.463 --> 33:24.831
- Windows are sealed.
- Leah Wells, are you in there?

33:26.000 --> 33:27.868
There's no adjoining room.

33:27.902 --> 33:30.804
FBI. Open up.

33:30.838 --> 33:32.472
Rhys.

33:32.507 --> 33:33.440
Rhys, put the gun away.

33:33.474 --> 33:35.709
FBI. Open this door.

33:35.743 --> 33:37.210
Can you open the door?

33:38.112 --> 33:39.379
Behind me.

33:44.319 --> 33:46.086
Who the hell are you?

33:50.258 --> 33:53.160
Okay, we can all put our guns down.

33:53.194 --> 33:54.161
Put your gun down.

33:54.195 --> 33:55.629
Them first.

33:55.663 --> 33:57.831
Trust me. Backup is on the way.

33:57.865 --> 34:00.000
Backup?

34:00.034 --> 34:01.668
Hey, stand down.

34:01.703 --> 34:03.303
Who are you?

34:03.338 --> 34:04.304
Who am I? Who are you?

34:04.339 --> 34:06.940
FBI. Agent Jules Dao.

34:06.975 --> 34:09.309
Copy that. I got them.

34:11.346 --> 34:13.146
Now answer the question. Who are you?

34:13.181 --> 34:16.350
U.S. Marshal, and you're
not authorized to be here.

34:16.384 --> 34:17.784
Copy.

34:17.819 --> 34:19.920
My ASAC would like a word with you.

34:19.954 --> 34:22.022
This way.

34:22.056 --> 34:24.091
Please.

34:30.831 --> 34:32.264
I-I'm sorry, Marshal.

34:32.300 --> 34:34.333
What did you say your name was again?

35:05.081 --> 35:06.612
You didn't have to kill anybody.

35:06.613 --> 35:08.813
They saw our faces. How else was
I supposed to get us out of there?

35:08.847 --> 35:09.947
Oh, so you got us out of there?

35:09.982 --> 35:11.990
Oh, now you're gonna have a
go at me, as well, are you?

35:11.991 --> 35:13.718
Wait, hold on. Where's Paul?

35:13.752 --> 35:16.587
- Who the hell's Paul?
- McCartney! The dog!

35:16.622 --> 35:17.522
The dog's gone?

35:17.556 --> 35:19.824
The dog and the package are both gone?!

35:19.858 --> 35:21.026
- Rhys.
- We have

35:21.051 --> 35:22.427
very few details right now,

35:22.461 --> 35:25.563
but the victim has been identified
as Jordan Hamlin,

35:25.597 --> 35:27.699
L.A.'s alleged crime kingpin.

35:27.733 --> 35:30.935
Local authorities have
yet to identify key suspects

35:30.969 --> 35:33.905
in the homicide, but
we are just getting word

35:33.939 --> 35:34.870
that it was Hamlin being

35:34.895 --> 35:35.840
- transported...
- Margot.

35:35.874 --> 35:38.443
From the courthouse
back to his holding cell

35:38.477 --> 35:39.777
- after today's hearing.

35:39.812 --> 35:41.379
You thieving bitch!

35:41.413 --> 35:43.881
You never learn.

35:43.916 --> 35:46.284
The most important
thing is to know your mark.

35:46.318 --> 35:47.785
Exactly... my mark!

35:47.820 --> 35:49.587
I didn't mean Leah.

35:49.621 --> 35:51.856
Obviously, if you're going
into business with someone,

35:51.890 --> 35:54.625
it's a boneheaded
strategy to threaten their dog.

35:54.660 --> 35:56.194
I suppose you killed
Hamlin, too, did you?

35:56.228 --> 35:59.897
A proper business
relationship requires a solid foundation.

35:59.932 --> 36:01.766
You're absolutely right about that.

36:01.800 --> 36:04.102
But you've played this all wrong.

36:04.136 --> 36:05.970
Have I?

36:06.004 --> 36:09.140
Hello, Paul McCartney.

36:09.174 --> 36:11.476
Yes.

36:11.510 --> 36:13.578
Because you didn't just steal from me.

36:13.612 --> 36:16.481
You stole from Mummy.

36:16.515 --> 36:19.617
And I'm going to tell.

36:27.926 --> 36:30.128
Did you know about
this? Were you helping her?

36:30.162 --> 36:31.963
No, of course not, Rhys.

36:31.997 --> 36:36.134
If you want to keep a
certain redhead healthy and happy...

36:36.168 --> 36:37.001
Yeah, that's right.

36:37.035 --> 36:39.504
I know all about you and Alice Vaughan.

36:39.538 --> 36:41.105
And I can't wait to meet her.

36:41.140 --> 36:43.574
So, for both your sakes,

36:43.609 --> 36:47.078
I suggest you stay loyal to me.

36:50.048 --> 36:53.117
I'm just gonna call my mum.

36:56.321 --> 36:59.423
Tell me again why we're in
business with these people.

37:05.731 --> 37:09.033
You needed to find out the truth.

37:09.067 --> 37:11.269
And in the process, I ended
up lying to all of you.

37:11.303 --> 37:12.903
I did to you what Christopher did to me.

37:12.905 --> 37:14.772
- No, Alice.
- Please.

37:14.807 --> 37:16.774
- But I'm done now.
- With Christopher?

37:16.809 --> 37:18.442
The Kensington Firm... all of it.

37:18.477 --> 37:20.878
It's Dao's problem now. Not ours.

37:22.981 --> 37:24.482
We have Kelsey to think about.

37:24.516 --> 37:25.983
They're both so young.

37:26.018 --> 37:27.151
How old are they?

37:27.186 --> 37:29.554
Kelsey's 20. Tyler's 19.

37:29.588 --> 37:31.889
And how long have they been at Nathan's?

37:31.924 --> 37:32.757
Two years.

37:32.791 --> 37:36.027
Which means that Tyler was almost 18

37:36.061 --> 37:38.296
- when Nathan started filming him.
- Oh, my God.

37:38.330 --> 37:40.398
Nathan recorded a minor having sex.

37:40.432 --> 37:41.799
Which means he can be charged

37:41.834 --> 37:43.234
with possession of child pornography.

37:43.268 --> 37:45.403
And child exploitation with
intent to distribute,

37:45.437 --> 37:47.004
which is 5 to 20 years in jail.

37:47.039 --> 37:48.906
- Who are you calling?
- Our friend at the FBI.

37:48.941 --> 37:50.641
Nathan Ashmore's about to discover

37:50.676 --> 37:52.376
there is such a thing as bad press.

37:53.912 --> 37:56.647
With Nathan on
trial as a sex offender,

37:56.682 --> 37:59.050
PMG will have no
choice but to sever ties

37:59.084 --> 38:01.619
with Ashmore
Records, and you'll be free.

38:03.755 --> 38:06.824
The thing is, Nathan was right.

38:06.859 --> 38:09.560
People know who I am. They're
buying the record.

38:09.595 --> 38:12.563
So what do I do? Do
I just walk away, or...

38:12.598 --> 38:14.699
You do whatever you want to do.

38:14.733 --> 38:16.434
But on your terms, not his.

38:16.468 --> 38:18.069
You can be an indie artist.

38:18.103 --> 38:19.783
You can sign a licensing
deal with a label.

38:19.805 --> 38:21.172
You two can get your band back together.

38:21.206 --> 38:23.086
- What was the name of it again?
- Do not tell him.

38:23.108 --> 38:24.876
- I want to see the videos.
- There are videos?

38:24.910 --> 38:27.245
I want to see the videos.

38:27.279 --> 38:29.413
But the point is, whatever you do,

38:29.448 --> 38:31.115
whatever choice you make,

38:31.149 --> 38:33.017
we're here for you... whatever you need.

38:33.986 --> 38:35.720
Thank you.

38:35.754 --> 38:37.288
Mm-hmm.

38:37.322 --> 38:40.057
The Ukulele Twins?

38:40.092 --> 38:42.093
- No.
- Mm...

38:43.962 --> 38:45.529
Tiny Guitars R Us?

38:45.564 --> 38:47.531
No.

38:47.566 --> 38:49.033
The Twee Sisters.

38:49.067 --> 38:51.469
That's actually really good.

38:51.503 --> 38:53.871
Why won't you show me your videos?

38:53.906 --> 38:54.872
Why do you want to see them?

38:54.907 --> 38:58.709
Because you won't show
them to me, of course.

38:59.978 --> 39:02.446
Good night, Daniel.

Two U.S. Marshals died today.

39:55.200 --> 39:58.057
- Allie, listen.
- They had wives. They had families.

39:58.197 --> 39:59.562
That's why I'm calling.

40:13.752 --> 40:15.686
Figured you'd be less
likely to pull a gun on me

40:15.721 --> 40:17.311
if I showed up with the authorities.

40:24.133 --> 40:26.487
You asked me to choose.

40:30.570 --> 40:32.253
I choose you.
