00:04.770 --> 00:09.200
Hey, great things are happening here
at the United People's Relief Telethon,

00:09.290 --> 00:12.920
thanks to you
and to our amazing volunteers.

00:13.010 --> 00:15.200
Look who we have with us this hour,

00:15.290 --> 00:19.040
teen pop sensations Hannah Montana

00:20.650 --> 00:22.600
and Mikayla.

00:28.210 --> 00:31.120
l wish you could feel the love
in this room.

00:32.290 --> 00:33.920
l still hate you.

00:34.010 --> 00:36.650
Hate makes you ugly. Too late.

00:38.650 --> 00:40.760
Well, let's see how we're doing.

00:40.850 --> 00:45.160
That is so generous.
l have a pledge for $300, Colin.

00:45.250 --> 00:46.680
Outstanding!

00:47.250 --> 00:48.960
l just got $400.

00:50.010 --> 00:52.200
And l've got tears in my eyes.

00:52.290 --> 00:55.240
We'll be right back,
but you keep calling.

00:56.570 --> 00:58.920
Hey, what's up? lt's Hannah Montana.
What would you like to give?

00:59.010 --> 01:02.320
l'd like to give you singing lessons.
Just heard your new single. Ouch!

01:03.890 --> 01:07.480
Well, l just heard yours,
and l thought it was fantastic.

01:07.570 --> 01:08.600
Really?

01:08.690 --> 01:11.250
Yeah, my brother ate some bad catfish,

01:11.330 --> 01:13.920
so we played it for him
to induce vomiting.

01:14.010 --> 01:17.280
lt was like... lnsta-puke!

01:18.570 --> 01:20.120
-Has-been.
-Never was.

01:20.210 --> 01:21.760
-Bottle blonde.
-Lip-syncer.

01:21.850 --> 01:23.040
Bra-stuffer.

01:25.050 --> 01:26.370
-l hate you.
-Like l care.

01:26.450 --> 01:28.600
<i>We're back in three, two..</i>.

01:33.810 --> 01:37.690
l'll tell you what l'd like to stuff,
my knuckles up her nose.

01:38.370 --> 01:42.200
Miles, don't let her push your buttons.
She's not worth it.

01:42.290 --> 01:44.800
You're right.
My life is complicated enough.

01:44.890 --> 01:47.680
The last thing l need is more drama.

01:47.770 --> 01:49.170
Hey, Miley.

01:50.410 --> 01:52.560
Hello, drama.

01:59.770 --> 02:01.320
<i>come on</i>!

02:01.410 --> 02:03.600

02:47.450 --> 02:50.840
Jake! What a surprise.

02:52.610 --> 02:53.760
Wow.

02:55.010 --> 02:58.280
-Awkward.
-Anyhoo,

02:59.050 --> 03:00.600
why don't we...

03:03.250 --> 03:05.440
-Go inside?
-That could work.

03:07.770 --> 03:10.000
Come in. Let's talk.

03:10.090 --> 03:12.600
Man, he wants to
get back together with me.

03:12.690 --> 03:15.080
Don't you dare
leave me alone with him.

03:15.170 --> 03:16.650
Why would l leave my little sister

03:16.730 --> 03:21.930
when she and her ex are gonna talk
about relationships and feelings and...

03:24.570 --> 03:26.480
You two kids have fun.

03:31.050 --> 03:33.440
-Hi.
-You look great.

03:33.530 --> 03:34.800
Oh, boy.

03:35.650 --> 03:38.600
-Listen, Miley, l...
-l know. l know.

03:40.530 --> 03:43.170
You haven't been able
to forget about me.

03:43.250 --> 03:45.440
Your life feels empty without me.

03:45.530 --> 03:49.120
You see my face everywhere you look,
and you've come back to say...

03:49.210 --> 03:51.320
l just want to be friends.

03:52.330 --> 03:55.050
Big blonde sack of drama say what?

03:55.130 --> 03:56.200
You know, l've been thinking about it,

03:56.290 --> 03:58.280
and just because things
didn't work out between us

03:58.370 --> 04:01.560
doesn't mean we can't still be
in each other's lives.

04:01.650 --> 04:04.400
So, you're not into me at all?

04:06.050 --> 04:08.720
Not even a little bit? l mean, come on,
it's only been a couple of months.

04:08.810 --> 04:11.200
What are you, made of stone?

04:11.810 --> 04:14.840
-Miley, if this is too hard for you, l...
-Me?

04:16.529 --> 04:19.279
Are you kidding?
l was worried about you.

04:19.370 --> 04:23.080
l mean, this is so great.
l would love to be friends.

04:30.530 --> 04:35.040
-Yeah. This is great.
-Great? lt's perfect.

04:43.290 --> 04:44.320
Looks like somebody got up

04:44.410 --> 04:47.050
on the wrong side
of the hamster wheel this morning.

04:47.810 --> 04:51.200
The water's out at my house,
and l haven't showered in two days.

04:51.290 --> 04:52.840
So? We're guys.

04:52.930 --> 04:55.600
We're not supposed
to shower every day.

04:56.850 --> 04:59.310
That's what magazine
cologne samples are for.

05:00.410 --> 05:01.890
Or car air-fresheners.

05:01.970 --> 05:03.450
You put a couple of these
in your pockets

05:03.530 --> 05:06.200
and you're good for four to six weeks.

05:07.530 --> 05:10.880
-Like you've never done it.
-Here, dude, try this.

05:16.970 --> 05:18.760
What kind of cologne is this?

05:18.850 --> 05:22.200
lt's not.
l spilled pickle juice on it an hour ago.

05:22.650 --> 05:24.840
-You just got poned.
-Poned.

05:26.770 --> 05:30.120
-You think this is funny?
-Yeah. Hence the laughter.

05:31.290 --> 05:35.170
-Dude, get over it. lt's only two days.
-l wish.

05:35.250 --> 05:38.440
The plumber said our water's
gonna be out for at least a week.

05:38.530 --> 05:39.600
What am l gonna do?

05:39.690 --> 05:42.640
Grow up
and release your inner man stink.

05:42.730 --> 05:44.240
Your man stink.

05:44.330 --> 05:46.360
Easy for you to say.

05:46.450 --> 05:48.840
l bet you guys free hotdogs for a month

05:48.930 --> 05:50.720
that you guys can't go
without showering

05:50.810 --> 05:54.640
or changing your clothes,
until they turn my water back on.

05:54.730 --> 05:56.720
-Free...
-Hot dogs?

05:56.810 --> 05:58.440
Dude, you are so on.

05:58.530 --> 06:02.240
lt's gonna be like taking candy
from a stanky baby.

06:02.330 --> 06:04.480
Now, wait. Wait.

06:04.570 --> 06:06.320
lf we lose, what do you get?

06:06.410 --> 06:09.840
The satisfaction of looking
at you guys and saying...

06:12.570 --> 06:14.560
Did l mention
l haven't brushed my teeth, either?

06:14.650 --> 06:17.290
Yeah, we kind of figured that out.

06:17.370 --> 06:20.520
-l think l got some in my mouth.
-Gross, gross!

06:23.210 --> 06:26.320
And we're back
on <i>Wake Up, lt's Wend</i> y

06:27.450 --> 06:32.160
with former zombie slayer
and current teen-screen sensation,

06:32.250 --> 06:33.600
Jake Ryan.

06:36.570 --> 06:40.560
That's right. lsn't he just yummy?
lsn't he? lsn't he? He is.

06:41.530 --> 06:43.360
So, Jake, you're back in town.

06:43.450 --> 06:45.960
You're here to shoot a couple of scenes
from your new movie,

06:46.050 --> 06:49.000
<i>Roger Bucks</i> :
<i>lntergalactic Bounty Hunter</i>.

06:50.810 --> 06:53.640
You better set your phasers on ''fun.''

06:53.730 --> 06:55.800
Tell us all about it. Right? Tell us.

06:55.890 --> 06:57.880
-Tell us! Tell us! Tell us!
-Tell us! Tell us! Tell us!

06:57.970 --> 06:59.400
Okay. All right. Well...

06:59.490 --> 07:02.160
Well, first, l'm really glad
to have a few days in LA

07:02.250 --> 07:05.000
before we go to Antarctica
to do the rest of the movie.

07:05.090 --> 07:06.960
You know, it gives me a chance
to spend some time

07:07.050 --> 07:09.040
with some really good friends.

07:09.130 --> 07:12.480
You hear that? Great friends.
That's me.

07:13.770 --> 07:17.810
There is no way you
and Heartbreak Jake can be friends.

07:17.890 --> 07:19.400
Yes, we can.

07:20.370 --> 07:21.920
You know what? l think being friends

07:22.010 --> 07:23.640
is the best thing
that's ever happened to us.

07:23.730 --> 07:27.000
l mean, we can finally hang out
without any of that relationship junk.

07:27.090 --> 07:28.160
lt's so simple.

07:28.250 --> 07:31.440
No more insecurity
or anger or jealousy.

07:34.210 --> 07:38.200
And l'm so excited to introduce
the intergalactic alien babe

07:38.290 --> 07:41.040
that l'll be kissing
for the next eight weeks.

07:41.130 --> 07:45.010
Put your hands together
for my beautiful co-star,

07:45.090 --> 07:46.520
Mikayla.

07:47.730 --> 07:48.920
What?

07:56.370 --> 07:59.160
Well, that's our show for today.

07:59.250 --> 08:04.120
We're gonna see you tomorrow when
your alarm clocks will ring and say,

08:04.210 --> 08:06.670
-''Wake up, it's Wendy.''
-''Wake up, it's Wendy.''

08:06.770 --> 08:07.880
Bye-bye.

08:07.970 --> 08:09.760
And we're out.

08:09.850 --> 08:11.600
-Thank you so much for having us.
-You're welcome.

08:11.690 --> 08:15.320
You're very welcome.
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

08:15.410 --> 08:17.640
Wendy, you don't have to yell.
We're right here.

08:17.730 --> 08:21.610
l know. lt takes me 20 minutes after
every show to stop talking like this.

08:21.690 --> 08:24.640
lt does, it really does. lt really does.

08:27.010 --> 08:30.720
-Hey. So, what did you think?
-You were great.

08:30.810 --> 08:33.480
That big announcement, boy, was that

08:34.289 --> 08:37.280
great and big.

08:37.370 --> 08:38.919
Didn't see that one coming.

08:39.010 --> 08:40.840
Yeah, l thought about asking,
you know,

08:40.929 --> 08:42.559
Hannah Montana
to play my love interest,

08:42.650 --> 08:46.360
but l didn't want to do anything
that might risk the new friendship.

08:46.450 --> 08:48.800
Little late for that, buddy boy.

08:50.410 --> 08:53.280
So, you went with Mikayla
instead of asking me

08:53.370 --> 08:55.830
because you didn't want to
risk our new friendship?

08:55.930 --> 08:59.000
Exactly. l mean, you know,
how awkward would that be?

08:59.090 --> 09:02.240
The alien babe and l kiss from one end
of the universe to the other.

09:02.330 --> 09:06.440
l mean, it's like every single scene is
kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss...

09:06.530 --> 09:07.850
l got it.

09:08.770 --> 09:11.280
Miley, l mean,
you're not jealous, are you?

09:11.370 --> 09:15.960
Are you kidding?
l'm happy for you, friend.

09:17.690 --> 09:18.800
Pal.

09:23.250 --> 09:26.360
You get any happier,
you're gonna break my arm.

09:26.970 --> 09:28.320
Hey, Jake.

09:28.930 --> 09:32.200
-And l know who you are.
-You do?

09:32.290 --> 09:34.480
Of course. You're Jake's ex-girlfriend.

09:34.570 --> 09:37.030
Right. 'Cause we've never met
or anything.

09:37.130 --> 09:39.720
-Or worked together or anything.
-Lilly.

09:39.810 --> 09:41.840
Well, you haven't.

09:42.210 --> 09:43.360
Excuse me, Mr Ryan.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.120
There's a couple of guys from the crew

09:45.210 --> 09:48.080
who are wondering
if they could get a picture with you.

09:50.970 --> 09:53.480
Well, l'm not gonna say no to that.

09:55.890 --> 09:58.610
l just want you to know
how amazing l think you are.

09:58.690 --> 10:00.280
-Really?
-Of course.

10:00.370 --> 10:02.830
l could never watch my ex-boyfriend
macking on another girl

10:02.930 --> 10:04.800
and stay friends with him.

10:05.530 --> 10:09.570
Well, it's true. l am amazing,
and it's just a movie, right?

10:10.290 --> 10:11.720
Well, l sure hope not.

10:11.810 --> 10:16.080
l mean, come on, he's beyond cute.
l can't believe you dumped him.

10:16.730 --> 10:19.190
Yep. She's just a little dumpster.

10:22.770 --> 10:25.410
So, you're really into him?

10:25.490 --> 10:28.480
Are you kidding? l'm already working
on our celebrity couple names.

10:28.570 --> 10:32.160
Right now,
it's between ''Jakayla'' and ''Mikake.''

10:33.690 --> 10:37.240
Too bad you're not old enough
for Donald Trump.

10:37.330 --> 10:39.890
You could be ''Old MikDonald.''

10:45.130 --> 10:47.320
Hey, you're funny.

10:47.410 --> 10:48.840
Man, it's too bad
you're not famous, too.

10:48.930 --> 10:51.200
We could've been such good friends.

10:58.250 --> 10:59.730
lt had to be Mikayla?

10:59.810 --> 11:03.040
Relax. So what if she's into him?
He may not even like her.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.480
Are you kidding?

11:04.570 --> 11:09.040
Two months in Antarctica.
You're cold, you're lonely,

11:09.130 --> 11:12.840
and your snuggle options are between
a penguin and her. Do the math.

11:13.570 --> 11:16.400
-So go warn him.
-l can't.

11:16.490 --> 11:20.370
lf l tell him that l hate Mikayla,
he'll just think it's because l'm jealous.

11:20.450 --> 11:23.480
But you do hate her
and you are jealous.

11:23.570 --> 11:25.320
l am not jealous.

11:27.330 --> 11:29.000
l am his friend,

11:29.690 --> 11:34.920
and as his friend, it's my job
to get Mikayla fired off that set

11:35.010 --> 11:38.160
before they start sharing mukluks
in Antarctica.

11:39.170 --> 11:42.080
Please tell me
your plan doesn't involve me.

11:42.170 --> 11:44.320
-Oh, boy.
-Come on.

11:46.000 --> 11:52.074
Learn the unknown words of this movie
--->   Skeebdo.com

11:56.530 --> 11:58.560
Here's your lunch, boy.

11:59.170 --> 12:02.120
Come on, Dad. This is stupid.
Can't l come back in the house now?

12:02.210 --> 12:05.600
No way. You smell worse
than that week-old sardine

12:05.690 --> 12:09.880
Uncle Earl found in his fat fold
when he was looking for the remote.

12:10.290 --> 12:11.610
Come on.

12:11.690 --> 12:15.040
lt's just a little man funk.
What are you afraid of?

12:22.530 --> 12:26.000
Poor little guy,
flew right through the stank zone.

12:32.050 --> 12:35.080
-Hey, guys. Hey, thanks for coming by.
-No problem.

12:35.170 --> 12:37.200
We just wanted to wish you luck
on your first day of filming,

12:37.290 --> 12:39.930
'cause, you know,
that is what friends do.

12:40.010 --> 12:43.080
They're there for each other.
They support each other.

12:43.170 --> 12:45.000
So, where's Mikayla?

12:45.930 --> 12:48.960
-ln Makeup. Why?
-We just wanted to wish her luck.

12:49.050 --> 12:52.000
lt's not like we're here
to get her fired or anything. That's...

12:52.090 --> 12:53.490
That's crazy talk 'cause...

12:53.570 --> 12:57.120
Well, good luck. Break a leg.
Gotta go. Bye.

12:58.250 --> 13:01.360
-You stink under pressure.
-Then stop putting me under pressure.

13:02.250 --> 13:06.680
Listen, you flunky, Mikayla demanded
extra cashews in her trail mix,

13:06.770 --> 13:10.550
and if there isn't a boatload of
curvy nuts in her dressing room pronto,

13:10.650 --> 13:13.800
you're gonna be looking
for a new alien babe, okay?

13:13.890 --> 13:16.680
-l don't like cashews.
-l know, but l do.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.560
Mikayla, hi.

13:19.850 --> 13:22.120
Great. Little fans.

13:22.890 --> 13:26.280
Security! l thought
this was a closed set!

13:26.370 --> 13:28.880
lt's okay, Margo.
These are Jake's friends.

13:29.490 --> 13:32.440
Hi. lt's so nice to meet you.

13:35.890 --> 13:37.040
What?

13:38.210 --> 13:42.280
Listen, mister, we had a contract,
and it is legally binding.

13:43.410 --> 13:45.120
lf l get home
and your bedroom is not clean,

13:45.210 --> 13:47.850
you can forget about allowance.

13:47.930 --> 13:49.440
Okay, bye-bye.

13:51.250 --> 13:53.320
So, guys, what do you think
of my costume?

13:53.410 --> 13:56.360
Don't l look fabulous?
And check this out.

13:56.450 --> 13:57.480
<i>Kiss me, Roger Bucks</i>,

13:57.570 --> 14:01.040
<i>as if the fate of the galax</i> y
<i>depends on it, because it does</i>.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.760
That is so cool.

14:03.850 --> 14:05.520
You know who would like that?
Johnny Depp.

14:05.610 --> 14:07.680
-Yeah, and he's right outside.
-What?

14:07.770 --> 14:08.960
Yeah, we were just talking to him,

14:09.050 --> 14:11.040
and he said
he really wanted to meet you.

14:11.130 --> 14:12.450
-He did?
-He did.

14:12.530 --> 14:15.170
-He did?
-He did. Come on. Let's go!

14:17.410 --> 14:19.560
Say hi to Johnny for me.

14:20.570 --> 14:22.200
Johnny?

14:22.290 --> 14:23.960
Wait, he's not out here.

14:24.050 --> 14:26.120
-Too bad!
-See you, sucker.

14:31.570 --> 14:33.360
Phase 1 complete.

14:35.210 --> 14:37.120
Commencing Phase 2.

14:46.170 --> 14:50.360
Hey, consider yourselves lucky,
at least you can run away from it.

14:52.970 --> 14:54.760
<i>That's close enough</i>!

14:56.050 --> 14:57.640
Hey! You showered!

14:57.730 --> 14:59.440
-You're clean.
-We won!

14:59.530 --> 15:01.120
-Yeah, baby.
-Yeah.

15:01.210 --> 15:02.610
-No.
-No.

15:03.130 --> 15:05.720
Congratulations. Have a hotdog.

15:07.330 --> 15:09.040
The first of many.

15:10.370 --> 15:13.120
So, Rico,
when did your water go back on?

15:13.210 --> 15:15.960
-lt was never off.
-What?

15:16.050 --> 15:18.560
And now, thanks to your man stink,

15:18.650 --> 15:23.120
l'm the only sweet-smelling guy
within miles of this place.

15:23.210 --> 15:25.770
And you're happy about that because...

15:25.850 --> 15:28.490
Excuse me,
l'm looking for the photo shoot.

15:29.610 --> 15:34.160
The one for the swimsuit calendar?

15:36.810 --> 15:39.800
-Let me walk you over.
-Girls, it's this way.

15:41.170 --> 15:44.280
-My goodness, you are so cute.
-You are so cute.

15:46.010 --> 15:47.520
You set us up.

15:47.610 --> 15:51.570
lt was like taking candy
from two stanky babies.

15:52.530 --> 15:53.850
Shall we?

15:54.450 --> 15:56.040
Hey...

15:56.290 --> 15:58.750
-Come back. l'm a Taurus.
-Oliver.

15:58.850 --> 16:00.800
v ery good to meet you.

16:11.570 --> 16:13.720
-Are you sure this is gonna work?
-lt will.

16:13.810 --> 16:17.640
As soon as l'm done being Mikayla,
she's gonna be Mik-fired.

16:18.370 --> 16:21.360
So evil. lt's like you really are Mikayla.

16:23.090 --> 16:24.440
<i>Thank you</i>.

16:27.890 --> 16:30.200
Wow, Mikayla, you look great.

16:30.290 --> 16:33.400
-<i>That makes one of us</i>.
-What?

16:34.010 --> 16:35.600
<i>And l have to kiss you</i> ?

16:35.690 --> 16:38.480
<i>Well, l gues</i> s
<i>that's why they call it acting</i>.

16:38.570 --> 16:39.970
Okay, look, l know you're nervous,

16:40.050 --> 16:42.320
but it'd really help me
if you stop slamming me.

16:42.410 --> 16:45.400
<i>And it would really help m</i> e
<i>if you were better-looking</i>.

16:45.490 --> 16:48.280
-Okay, seriously...
-Okay, kids, now,

16:48.370 --> 16:54.280
in this scene, you have just discovered
Lord Zordac's cloning chamber. Okay?

16:54.370 --> 16:58.560
lt's tense, it's romantic,
and l know they're not real,

16:58.650 --> 17:03.320
but these little bug-eyed things are
kind of giving me the heebie-jeebies.

17:04.690 --> 17:07.150
Okay, let's shoot this sucker
and get out of here. Okay?

17:07.250 --> 17:09.560
And, action.

17:10.369 --> 17:12.829
We've got two minutes
to destroy these clones.

17:12.930 --> 17:15.490
But don't worry,
Roger Bucks has a plan.

17:16.410 --> 17:20.040
<i>l hope it includes an acting coach</i>.
<i>That was pitiful</i>.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.640
Cut! What...

17:24.890 --> 17:27.280
And, action.

17:28.170 --> 17:31.240
We may never get out of here,
so let me say this now and say it quick.

17:31.330 --> 17:34.600
l don't care
if your mother was a rainbow trout...

17:34.690 --> 17:37.640
<i>Hold that thought. l gotta take this</i>.

17:38.890 --> 17:40.480
<i>No, l'm not busy</i>.
<i>What's going on, girl</i> ?

17:40.570 --> 17:41.790
Cut!

17:47.530 --> 17:50.600
Okay, quick.
Throw me the flumium crystals.

17:50.690 --> 17:53.360
<i>You got two hands. Get them yourself</i>.

17:53.970 --> 17:56.080
-What?
-Cut!

17:56.170 --> 17:59.360
What is wrong with you?
Those aren't the lines.

17:59.450 --> 18:02.480
<i>They're bette</i> r
<i>than the garbage in this script</i>.

18:02.570 --> 18:05.400
<i>Who wrote this</i>,
<i>a monkey with a computer</i> ?

18:06.130 --> 18:07.760
l wrote it.

18:07.850 --> 18:11.040
<i>Yeah, we would've been better of</i> f
<i>with the monkey</i>.

18:11.130 --> 18:13.690
Mikayla, sweetheart.
What are you doing?

18:13.770 --> 18:16.640
l told you, you couldn't act like a jerk
until your second movie.

18:16.730 --> 18:21.000
<i>Then what's your excuse</i> ?
<i>Yeah. l went there</i>.

18:21.090 --> 18:23.730
Mikayla. Mikayla!

18:23.810 --> 18:27.160
Listen, pop star,
one more of your little diva moves

18:27.250 --> 18:29.280
and you're going to be off this movie.

18:29.370 --> 18:30.920
<i>Good to know</i>.

18:38.650 --> 18:40.440
What are you doing?

18:43.130 --> 18:46.120
-Turn it off!
-<i>Turn it up? Okay</i>.

18:55.490 --> 18:57.600
<i>Oh, off</i>!

19:02.650 --> 19:04.400
l want her fired!

19:06.250 --> 19:08.160
<i>Took you long enough</i>.

19:08.250 --> 19:11.040
Get your hands off me.
l'm the star of this movie.

19:11.130 --> 19:13.240
No. No. No. No.

19:19.170 --> 19:22.640
Don't listen to her! She's a...
A real alien!

19:25.930 --> 19:28.120
l told you l'm bad at this.

19:28.210 --> 19:30.520
-Mikayla?
-Yeah.

19:31.730 --> 19:34.880
-Miley?
-<i>Sweet niblets</i>!

19:40.290 --> 19:44.360
Mile, you must have known Jake
was gonna find out sooner or later.

19:44.450 --> 19:46.240
What in the world were you thinking?

19:46.330 --> 19:50.110
That Mikayla would get fired,
no one would believe her story

19:50.210 --> 19:53.880
and Jake would spend two months
snuggling with a penguin in Antarctica.

19:55.210 --> 19:56.720
l had to ask.

19:58.330 --> 20:00.000
Dad, l'm sorry.

20:00.090 --> 20:01.240
Hey, l appreciate that,

20:01.330 --> 20:04.960
but, you know, l'm not the one
you need to apologise to.

20:07.210 --> 20:09.930
Sure, now he leaves me
alone with a boy.

20:14.530 --> 20:17.280
l cannot believe what you did.

20:17.370 --> 20:19.930
l guess l kind of ruined
the friendship thing, huh?

20:20.010 --> 20:22.080
Well, you sure didn't do it
a whole lot of good.

20:22.170 --> 20:24.760
Miley, if you were jealous,
why didn't you just say something?

20:24.850 --> 20:27.040
-l was not jealous.
-Miley.

20:27.130 --> 20:28.800
Okay, fine, l was.

20:29.570 --> 20:31.680
Man, l mean,
you don't want to be a couple,

20:31.770 --> 20:35.240
and when l try to be friends,
you almost wreck my movie.

20:35.330 --> 20:38.080
-What am l gonna do with you?
-l don't know.

20:38.170 --> 20:39.600
Maybe we should just
forget about each other.

20:39.690 --> 20:40.910
-Maybe we should.
-Fine.

20:41.010 --> 20:42.160
Fine.

20:46.090 --> 20:50.440
-Okay, this isn't working for me.
-Me, neither.

20:51.570 --> 20:56.120
Look, last time, you were the one
with some growing up to do,

20:57.050 --> 20:59.200
and now it's my turn.

20:59.290 --> 21:02.600
But if l promise
not to wreck another movie,

21:02.690 --> 21:04.800
can we try to be friends again?

21:06.050 --> 21:08.560
-l'd like that.
-Me, too.

21:17.170 --> 21:21.130
-This isn't helping the friendship thing.
-Couldn't agree more.

21:26.330 --> 21:29.840
Great work today, sweetie.
Seriously, changed my life.

21:32.090 --> 21:33.520
-Mikayla.
-Security!

21:33.610 --> 21:35.090
No, no, no.

21:36.290 --> 21:38.400
We're here to apologise.

21:38.890 --> 21:43.480
l was jealous and stupid, and l'm sorry.

21:43.570 --> 21:47.200
And l'm just a sidekick
who needs to learn how to say no.

21:48.010 --> 21:49.520
Wait a second.

21:50.770 --> 21:54.440
Truth is, if l still liked a guy,
l would've done the same thing.

21:55.290 --> 21:56.280
Really?

21:56.370 --> 22:00.280
Well, l would've done it a little better,
but l appreciate the attempt.

22:01.770 --> 22:03.800
That was surprisingly nice of you.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.520
You know what?
l don't care if you're not famous.

22:05.610 --> 22:07.680
-l'm gonna let you be my friend.
-Cool.

22:07.770 --> 22:09.360
Sorry, not you.

22:10.490 --> 22:13.080
Really, Mikayla, you don't have to...

22:13.170 --> 22:15.200
Oh, my goodness,
this is going to be so much fun.

22:15.290 --> 22:18.200
We can do all my favourite things.
Shop, get our nails done,

22:18.290 --> 22:20.720
and talk about how much
l hate Hannah Montana.

22:20.810 --> 22:22.360
Let's start now.

22:22.450 --> 22:23.440
Yay!
