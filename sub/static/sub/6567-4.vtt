00:01.626 --> 00:03.284
Where there are
now two land masses,

00:03.309 --> 00:04.628
there once was just one.

00:04.629 --> 00:06.996
The Book of Leaves
has to be here.

00:07.064 --> 00:08.232
Take whatever steps are
necessary

00:08.300 --> 00:10.802
to find our spy.
Do it quickly.

00:10.870 --> 00:13.206
It is God's will
to break Lorenzo

00:13.274 --> 00:14.775
and all who support him.

00:14.843 --> 00:16.879
With the exception of
DaVinci, I agree with you.

00:16.947 --> 00:19.615
Those weapons he makes,
they could all be ours.

00:19.683 --> 00:22.485
Rome has more men,
and the Lord, on its side.

00:22.553 --> 00:24.955
Well, we've got
ten pipe organ muskets

00:25.023 --> 00:28.393
capable of firing 33 rounds
a minute on ours.

00:28.460 --> 00:32.030
Ten guns. Good to know.
Thank you for that.

00:32.098 --> 00:33.498
Papers with the papal seal.

00:33.566 --> 00:35.935
A list of locations
to hide them.

00:36.003 --> 00:38.337
- Where did you find this?
- Signor Becchi's quarters.

00:38.405 --> 00:39.973
All along
the traitor was you.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.909
Lorenzo,
this is a mistake.

01:55.792 --> 01:57.792

01:59.295 --> 02:02.263
One of my huntsmen
wishes this decorated.

02:03.331 --> 02:05.699
You've a keen eye.
Paint it.

02:11.038 --> 02:13.372
When Leonardo was
14 years old,

02:13.407 --> 02:17.509
his father, Piero, having found
little use for the young man,

02:17.544 --> 02:19.578
gave him a task.

02:24.218 --> 02:28.455
Leo spent the next day collecting
all manner of strange creatures.

02:30.759 --> 02:32.960
And so long did he labor
dissecting them

02:32.994 --> 02:36.328
that the stench
was past bearing.

02:36.363 --> 02:37.930
But Leonardo didn't notice,

02:37.964 --> 02:40.566
so great was his love
for his art.

02:40.601 --> 02:42.969
It's finished, Father!
Come see.

Advertise your product or brand here

02:54.014 --> 02:55.914
It will suffice.

02:55.949 --> 02:59.785
Knowing that the hunting guide
would be none the wiser,

03:01.121 --> 03:06.125
Piero presented him
with a new shield,

03:06.159 --> 03:09.362
while selling the original
one to a vendor

03:09.396 --> 03:11.297
for 100 ducats.

03:11.332 --> 03:16.136
And then the vendor resold it
to the Duke of Milan himself

03:16.170 --> 03:18.338
for 300 ducats.

03:20.041 --> 03:22.476
Loath to pass up
such a resource,

03:22.510 --> 03:27.448
Piero arranged for his son to
be brought under my tutelage.

03:28.250 --> 03:31.753
I paid a finder's fee
of 50 ducats.

03:31.787 --> 03:33.988
A bargain, in my estimation.

03:34.023 --> 03:36.858
His father sold you
a bastard son.

03:36.892 --> 03:38.893
Yes. But you know what?

03:38.928 --> 03:41.096
I would trade 100 of you

03:41.130 --> 03:44.332
to have another one like him
on my doorstep.

03:44.367 --> 03:46.601
I think you're drunk,
old man.

03:46.636 --> 03:49.270
And you're jealous,
Botticelli.

03:49.305 --> 03:52.307
Tomorrow...I'll be sober.

03:55.078 --> 03:57.045
But you'll still be jealous.

04:02.919 --> 04:05.721
You're preoccupied today.

04:05.755 --> 04:07.923
Painting...

04:08.825 --> 04:11.360
..is about...it's about
more than just strokes.

04:11.394 --> 04:13.194
There's perspective.

04:13.229 --> 04:17.432
I mean, do I paint you
from below...

04:18.500 --> 04:20.569
..or do I paint you...

04:21.771 --> 04:23.138
..from above?

04:23.172 --> 04:25.173
And then there's symbols.

04:25.208 --> 04:27.442
Do I paint you
with a dog in your arms?

04:28.177 --> 04:30.112
It's a symbol of loyalty.

04:30.146 --> 04:34.683
Color. How about the particular
shade of vermillion...

04:34.717 --> 04:38.019
that I use for the blush
of your cheeks?

04:42.158 --> 04:43.659
And the folds of your dress.

04:43.693 --> 04:46.361
Should they be...

04:46.396 --> 04:50.733
lush and sumptuous...

04:51.635 --> 04:54.103
..or stiff and angular?

04:54.137 --> 04:56.438
And perhaps...

04:57.807 --> 04:59.775
..no gown at all.

04:59.809 --> 05:02.378
If I was a dutiful servant,

05:02.412 --> 05:05.681
I'd consider the needs
of my patron.

05:05.715 --> 05:08.517
But I'm not, so that...

05:10.120 --> 05:12.121
That is what I struggle with.

05:16.726 --> 05:18.794
You can't take your eyes
off that.

05:18.828 --> 05:20.996
What's so beautiful about it?

05:21.031 --> 05:24.934
It's the same thing
I see in you. It's a mystery.

05:24.968 --> 05:26.836
It's a puzzle

05:26.870 --> 05:29.305
and I will stop at nothing
to figure it out.

05:43.686 --> 05:45.654
Francesco.

05:45.688 --> 05:49.291
The walls of my Cappella
Maggiore lean and crumble,

05:49.325 --> 05:52.827
just as Rome itself
is in disrepair.

05:52.862 --> 05:56.665
This place must become
a grand palace of the Lord,

05:56.700 --> 05:58.901
celebrating his glory
in marble

05:58.935 --> 06:01.671
and majestic brushstrokes

06:01.705 --> 06:04.674
from the most enlightened
hands on earth.

06:04.709 --> 06:07.244
I will build
a gleaming chapel

06:07.278 --> 06:11.449
with the stories of Christ and
Moses frescoed on the ceiling.

06:11.483 --> 06:14.719
A tribute to the everlasting
grace of God.

06:14.753 --> 06:17.489
I can assure you,
Your Holiness,

06:17.523 --> 06:21.226
if you move your accounts
from the Medici Bank...

06:21.260 --> 06:24.663
to my own, you'll have
all the funds you need.

06:24.697 --> 06:28.099
This will require
more than funds.

06:28.134 --> 06:31.402
Resurrection requires death.

06:32.405 --> 06:34.306
And in this case,

06:34.340 --> 06:37.210
the sacrifice
for Rome's rebirth

06:37.244 --> 06:39.979
will be Florence.

06:40.013 --> 06:44.783
However, the Medici have certain
capabilities we are unsure we can best.

06:44.818 --> 06:47.787
We've tried
a frontal assault.

06:48.822 --> 06:51.658
We may need you to develop

06:51.692 --> 06:56.029
other...less direct
contingencies.

06:56.063 --> 06:57.931
The Medicis are the reason

06:57.965 --> 07:02.202
Florence is a sanctuary for
sorcerers and...sodomites.

07:02.237 --> 07:04.237
They've turned my city
away from the Lord.

07:04.272 --> 07:08.207
Together, Holy Father,
we will turn it back.

07:13.980 --> 07:16.615
Now gather your men,
Girolamo.

07:18.418 --> 07:21.019
You've a role to play
in this as well.

07:21.988 --> 07:24.289
He's been with our family
his entire life.

07:24.324 --> 07:26.058
He taught us our letters.

07:26.092 --> 07:29.027
I don't care if he held your prick
when you first took a piss.

07:29.061 --> 07:30.896
Becchi is a spy
and a traitor.

07:30.930 --> 07:33.165
His brother-in-law
carries epic debts

07:33.199 --> 07:35.901
which could only be met with
the Roman scudos we found.

07:35.935 --> 07:38.503
We broke the cipher
in dozens of letters he hid.

07:38.538 --> 07:40.805
Each one more incriminating
than the last.

07:40.840 --> 07:42.908
Now is not the time
to show mercy.

07:42.942 --> 07:46.778
So we're jailing old friends while making
new friends with lunatics like DaVinci.

07:46.813 --> 07:49.248
Our grandfather
made friends with lunatics.

07:49.282 --> 07:53.185
Brunelleschi was one and he created the
most majestic cathedral in Europe.

07:53.220 --> 07:55.821
If you believe
Becchi betrayed us,

07:56.923 --> 07:59.091
it's you who's gone mad.

08:00.827 --> 08:02.895
Lorenzo!

08:05.765 --> 08:07.866
No! No, please!

08:09.168 --> 08:14.038
Tell me, are you familiar with Abraham's
prayer for Sodom and Gomorrah?

08:14.072 --> 08:18.075
How many righteous people
did Abraham initially promise

08:18.109 --> 08:20.478
he would find
in those blighted cities?

08:20.512 --> 08:21.812
20?

08:21.847 --> 08:23.547
Unfortunate.

08:23.582 --> 08:25.683
No! Please!

08:27.252 --> 08:29.220
And your answer?

08:29.254 --> 08:32.289
No? No?

08:32.323 --> 08:34.192
No idea?

08:41.066 --> 08:44.468
Are there no faithful
in this forsaken place

08:44.503 --> 08:47.638
or are you all damned?

08:47.672 --> 08:49.673
You. Stand.

08:49.708 --> 08:52.542
Let us pray you know
the right reply.

08:55.380 --> 08:56.880
- What?
-  50.

08:58.415 --> 09:00.516
50! Signor.

09:03.053 --> 09:05.254
You are correct.

09:06.556 --> 09:09.492
You will deliver this message
to the Medicis.

09:09.526 --> 09:12.428
It contains,
in exacting detail,

09:12.462 --> 09:15.898
the horrors
witnessed here today.

09:18.101 --> 09:20.503
Why in God's name
are we here, Riario?

09:20.537 --> 09:23.839
Tell me, Captain, how much did you
give the Medicis for your coat?

09:23.873 --> 09:26.308
I bought it in Rome,
not Florence.

09:26.342 --> 09:31.079
Every dyed fabric in Europe
uses alum from these mines

09:31.114 --> 09:33.215
to fix the dye.

09:34.684 --> 09:37.320
Did you know, Pope Pius II

09:37.354 --> 09:40.156
gave this mining concern
to the Medicis

09:40.190 --> 09:43.627
in return for forgiveness
of papal debt.

09:44.596 --> 09:47.765
And since then, every frock,
sheet and shirt

09:47.799 --> 09:50.234
has had a portion of its
price going to Florence.

09:51.002 --> 09:55.171
Today we killed three birds
with one stone.

09:56.841 --> 10:00.177
We took back
what was rightfully Rome's.

10:00.211 --> 10:03.179
We eliminated a lucrative
source of Medici income

10:03.214 --> 10:05.382
and most importantly...

10:06.917 --> 10:09.252
..we sent a message.

10:19.497 --> 10:22.065
This is an art, this pursuit.

10:23.534 --> 10:26.469
I like just making
one of something.

10:26.504 --> 10:29.472
Get used to it. We've got
plenty more copies to go.

10:29.506 --> 10:31.241
What is it
that I'm getting used to?

10:31.275 --> 10:35.011
Making each soldier's death
indistinguishable from the last?

10:35.046 --> 10:37.580
Leonardo, you're needed
at the palace.

10:37.615 --> 10:39.482
You playing errand boy now,
Father?

10:39.517 --> 10:43.019
In these traitorous times,
we fill any role required.

10:43.921 --> 10:46.823
Come on. The Medicis
are none of them patient men.

10:48.793 --> 10:50.661
Not you two.

10:51.429 --> 10:53.731
This is state business,
not a sideshow.

11:10.049 --> 11:14.686
If you are in this room, it is because you
reside in my innermost circle of trust.

11:15.721 --> 11:20.058
And if you are in my circle, it is because
we share a common vision for Florence.

11:20.092 --> 11:22.393
A city that will be
remembered for centuries

11:22.428 --> 11:26.898
as a cynosure of innovation
and artistry.

11:26.932 --> 11:30.635
I have received word from
Tolfa, Commander Quattrone,

11:32.137 --> 11:36.507
that Count Riario
has attacked our alum mine.

11:36.542 --> 11:39.744
This is a casus belli.
An act of war.

11:41.314 --> 11:43.882
It is easy to be for Florence
in times of peace.

11:43.916 --> 11:45.517
Not so in times of war.

11:45.551 --> 11:48.987
Those who cannot stand
with us should leave.

11:50.356 --> 11:53.958
It is better to be a coward
now than a traitor later.

11:53.993 --> 11:57.429
I recently lost my most
trusted advisor to treachery.

11:57.463 --> 12:01.066
He currently sits in the Bargello
awaiting his fate on the wheel.

12:01.901 --> 12:05.304
In the Medici court,
we punish treason

12:05.338 --> 12:08.174
and we reward service.

12:08.208 --> 12:12.913
Would the young man who brought me
this scroll please come forward.

12:16.785 --> 12:19.253
So tell us, please, how did
you come by the scroll?

12:19.287 --> 12:21.088
A Tolfan miner, sir.

12:21.123 --> 12:22.757
Count Riario killed
all but one

12:22.791 --> 12:25.259
whom he tasked with
delivering the scroll.

12:25.293 --> 12:27.461
And would you tell us
what it says?

12:27.495 --> 12:29.663
Riario has an army, sir.

12:29.698 --> 12:35.402
He intends to occupy Florence
unless you do as Rome asks.

12:36.505 --> 12:38.572
Did the miner convey
this to you?

12:38.607 --> 12:41.909
He's a simple man, sir.
I doubt he can read.

12:41.943 --> 12:44.478
So you broke the seal

12:44.512 --> 12:46.747
and revealed its contents
to others?

12:47.715 --> 12:50.685
Arrest him.

12:51.887 --> 12:53.121
No.

12:53.155 --> 12:56.090
- Warm up the wheel with his bones!
- Please, sir! No!

12:56.125 --> 12:59.227
I will show no mercy to those
who betray the Medici name.

13:00.630 --> 13:04.166
Each of you has a responsibility
to this community.

13:05.602 --> 13:09.672
To protect. To invent.
To maintain order.

13:09.706 --> 13:12.108
To support.

13:12.143 --> 13:16.312
To uphold the sacred honor
of the Medici legacy.

13:19.850 --> 13:21.817
We all knew
this day would come.

13:21.852 --> 13:24.086
We will not submit.

13:25.122 --> 13:27.156
We will fight.

13:28.592 --> 13:31.026
Alla Battaglia Firenze!

13:31.494 --> 13:33.928
Alla Battaglia Firenze!

13:44.139 --> 13:45.940
I think I have a cat
in my bag.

13:45.974 --> 13:48.109
Would you like to kick that,
too?

13:48.143 --> 13:49.377
Enough.

13:49.411 --> 13:52.914
A city that will be remembered
for centuries to come

13:52.948 --> 13:55.650
as a cynosure for innovation
and artistry.

13:55.685 --> 13:58.319
That's a direct quote
from Becchi's counsel to you,

13:58.353 --> 14:02.657
when you were a shit-scared 19-year-old
poet about to ascend the throne.

14:02.691 --> 14:04.425
- Not now.
- Yes, now.

14:05.227 --> 14:08.796
There's a difference
between strength and cruelty, Lorenzo.

14:09.564 --> 14:11.898
Leave cruelty to Sixtus
and his brutes

14:11.933 --> 14:13.833
or it won't be Rome...

14:13.867 --> 14:16.502
It'll be our own people
who move against us.

14:17.604 --> 14:19.705
Do me a kindness, brother.

14:21.008 --> 14:23.476
When I ride out
to meet Count Riario,

14:24.878 --> 14:26.879
stay home.

14:56.542 --> 15:01.245
Ladies and gentlemen, I have here the
shattered ankle bone of St Alibinus.

15:01.280 --> 15:04.916
A single shard of which
is guaranteed to protect

15:04.950 --> 15:07.518
against all pirates
and all ruffians.

15:07.553 --> 15:10.021
And, for a few soldi more,

15:10.055 --> 15:14.125
the fingers of the esteemed
martyr St Bessus!

15:14.159 --> 15:16.527
- It's Bess-us, you idiot!
- Oh, piss off.

15:16.561 --> 15:19.530
- What causes this commotion?
- Who else wants some?

15:19.565 --> 15:22.400
People have gathered
for an execution.

15:26.304 --> 15:29.407
Gentile Becchi wasn't meant to be
brought up until the full moon.

15:29.441 --> 15:32.243
No, not Becchi. A servant.

15:36.248 --> 15:40.551
Thanks to him, word of Riario's
incursion has spread like wildfire

15:40.585 --> 15:43.153
and Lorenzo wants to make
an example.

15:47.792 --> 15:50.094
The Confraternity of Death
are such vultures.

15:50.128 --> 15:52.229
Someone has to pray
for the condemned.

15:59.471 --> 16:01.271
This is ugly business
for a lady.

16:01.306 --> 16:02.806
No.

16:02.840 --> 16:05.742
Even a lady must support
the Medicis against spies.

16:10.181 --> 16:12.349
God.

16:12.850 --> 16:15.018
How long will this take?

16:15.987 --> 16:18.021
It can last hours.

16:18.055 --> 16:20.723
God help any man
who betrays Lorenzo.

16:26.764 --> 16:28.965
What are you reading?

16:29.600 --> 16:31.301
A Book of Hours.

16:31.335 --> 16:34.171
In the original Latin,
no doubt.

16:35.474 --> 16:37.842
I always hated that language.

16:37.876 --> 16:40.244
As was evident
in your studies.

16:40.278 --> 16:43.113
Perhaps you were simply
a piss-poor teacher.

16:43.148 --> 16:45.182
Perhaps.

16:57.661 --> 17:00.263
I'm sorry it's come to this.

17:00.297 --> 17:02.398
Mm.

17:04.067 --> 17:07.536
Why didn't you tell us about
your family's need for money.

17:07.570 --> 17:10.439
I would never have troubled you
with my relatives' mishaps.

17:10.473 --> 17:12.441
But you would take coin
from Rome?

17:12.474 --> 17:14.510
Ask yourself, my boy.

17:14.545 --> 17:19.115
If money had motivated me, why
wouldn't it have been spent already?

17:19.150 --> 17:22.484
Instead of lying conveniently in
my quarters awaiting discovery.

17:22.520 --> 17:25.289
Along with the papal seals
of Rome.

17:25.323 --> 17:27.324
I want to believe.

17:28.425 --> 17:31.629
You counseled my grandfather
Cosimo. My father.

17:32.531 --> 17:34.833
You've given your life
in service to Florence.

17:34.867 --> 17:37.269
Always doing your best
to protect the Medici name.

17:37.303 --> 17:39.304
But when I am gone,
Giuliano,

17:39.338 --> 17:42.273
I will no longer be able
to provide such protection.

17:42.308 --> 17:44.609
Are you innocent
of these charges or not?

17:44.643 --> 17:47.278
- Of course I am.
- Then why don't you fight them?

17:47.312 --> 17:49.947
Because your brother
is incapable of listening.

17:50.682 --> 17:53.084
Lorenzo is consumed
with wrath.

17:53.919 --> 17:57.022
It blinds him to the dangers
circling him.

17:59.892 --> 18:02.327
There is a traitor
in our midst.

18:03.529 --> 18:05.997
After I am dead
and Lorenzo lowers his guard,

18:06.032 --> 18:07.966
the traitor
will still be here.

18:10.703 --> 18:13.539
People underestimate you,
Giuliano.

18:14.407 --> 18:17.209
Yet that perceived weakness
makes you uniquely suited

18:17.243 --> 18:19.611
to flushing out a spy
from cover.

18:23.049 --> 18:25.017
Look after your brother.

18:26.052 --> 18:28.654
He needs you.
Now more than ever.

18:39.901 --> 18:41.735
Riario will advance
from the south,

18:41.770 --> 18:43.937
through the Valdarno Valley.

18:43.972 --> 18:45.806
We'll place weapons
on all sides,

18:45.840 --> 18:47.941
but the majority
will meet his men here.

18:47.976 --> 18:50.176
- We'll be outnumbered.
- They'll be outgunned.

18:50.211 --> 18:52.912
With ten guns?
Are you certain?

18:52.947 --> 18:54.680
We're casting more muskets.

18:54.715 --> 18:58.584
I promise you you'll never
have to fire them.

18:58.619 --> 19:00.653
Sometimes...

19:01.488 --> 19:04.090
..when all your enemy knows
is killing,

19:04.124 --> 19:06.492
a simple deception
can suffice.

19:07.527 --> 19:10.963
Riario is far more clever
than you think, DaVinci.

19:10.998 --> 19:13.266
Your wit won't get us
out of this one.

19:14.702 --> 19:16.503
Only your weapons will.

19:16.537 --> 19:19.372
And I promise you
they will fire.

20:00.583 --> 20:02.417
- Magnifico!
- Commander.

20:03.385 --> 20:06.421
- Artista.
- War engineer, actually.

20:08.390 --> 20:10.859
That's a very handsome
stallion you have there.

20:10.893 --> 20:13.361
- Andalusian, no?
- Mm.

20:13.396 --> 20:16.631
Given to me personally by
Queen Isabella of Castile.

20:16.665 --> 20:18.500
I've heard of
these Andalusians.

20:18.534 --> 20:22.971
I understand the breed's
prone to ischemic diseases,

20:23.005 --> 20:26.174
reduced blood flow,
especially to the intestines,

20:26.208 --> 20:30.645
which can lead to some
unfortunate anal blockage.

20:30.679 --> 20:34.515
Undoubtedly, you're used to the smell
of shit following you wherever you go.

20:36.385 --> 20:38.186
In an effort to avoid
further bloodshed,

20:38.220 --> 20:41.422
His Eminence has extended
a list of demands.

20:41.457 --> 20:45.093
First, Florence will formally
embrace into its bosom

20:45.127 --> 20:49.831
Francesco Salviati
as Archbishop of Pisa.

20:49.866 --> 20:53.268
Second, the Medici Bank will
forgive the Holy See of all debts.

20:53.303 --> 20:58.440
And third, you will release certain
artisans from their contractual obligations

20:58.475 --> 21:00.442
so that they might
employ their gifts

21:00.476 --> 21:04.046
in service of His Holiness's
new chapel.

21:05.414 --> 21:08.149
And in which artist
is His Holiness interested?

21:13.655 --> 21:17.158
One...Pietro Perugino.

21:17.192 --> 21:19.360
One Sandro Botticelli.

21:20.095 --> 21:22.430
- Oh, Jesus...
- Ooh.

21:22.464 --> 21:24.665
Leonardo DaVinci.

21:24.700 --> 21:27.601
I'd rather have my testicles
gnawed off by conger eels.

21:27.636 --> 21:31.005
- Well, that can be arranged.
- And if we don't capitulate?

21:31.807 --> 21:34.007
My forces
will occupy Florence.

21:34.042 --> 21:37.712
My guns will cut your men
to ribbons.

21:37.746 --> 21:39.413
Your fabled
pipe organ muskets?

21:39.448 --> 21:42.850
Well, yes, they will cut down
some of them, but not all.

21:42.884 --> 21:44.785
Thanks to Giuliano's
bumbling,

21:44.820 --> 21:47.254
I was aware that you
possessed ten guns,

21:47.289 --> 21:49.056
and given that
I've observed them,

21:49.091 --> 21:51.959
I simply deduced
their cyclic rate of fire.

21:51.994 --> 21:56.698
Between them, they're capable of launching
33 volleys comprising 333 discharges.

21:56.732 --> 22:00.302
Now, let's...
Let's assume that...

22:00.336 --> 22:03.171
two-thirds of them
hit their mark.

22:03.206 --> 22:07.443
But what happens while your
brave militiamen are reloading?

22:22.492 --> 22:25.661
My remaining 400 ride out.

22:25.695 --> 22:30.499
And, yes, we will use your precious
Florentines as target practice.

22:30.533 --> 22:32.668
You face a walled city,
Riario.

22:32.702 --> 22:35.670
We can hold you off
for six months at the least.

22:35.705 --> 22:38.773
It takes but one person to open
the gates from the inside.

22:38.808 --> 22:42.444
Do you truly believe
that in those months

22:42.478 --> 22:46.147
the call of the Holy Father won't be
honored by a single soul in Florence?

22:46.182 --> 22:50.519
You have 24 hours to ponder
the Holy Father's offer.

22:51.254 --> 22:53.523
Enjoy your day.

22:55.960 --> 22:57.994
We need more guns, DaVinci.

22:58.028 --> 23:00.563
Our lives depend on it.

23:09.307 --> 23:11.041
Shouldn't we be building guns

23:11.075 --> 23:13.210
or at least preparing
for the invasion?

23:13.244 --> 23:15.412
- I'm sketching.
- Pomegranates.

23:15.446 --> 23:17.047
Nothing escapes you.

23:17.081 --> 23:19.149
Count Riario
is nearly upon us.

23:19.183 --> 23:20.984
I know damn well
where Riario is!

23:21.019 --> 23:24.188
- What are we doing here?
- I wonder about that myself.

23:24.222 --> 23:26.757
Excuse us, Signora.

23:26.792 --> 23:29.460
You're rather careless
with your sketches, Artista.

23:29.494 --> 23:32.563
You left a sheaf of them
in my husband's study.

23:32.597 --> 23:36.066
Shouldn't you be laboring
for the security of Florence?

23:38.269 --> 23:41.972
There's something about this pomegranate.
I can't define it yet.

23:42.006 --> 23:44.975
But the Greeks teach us
everything can be everything.

23:45.009 --> 23:48.245
And everything can be turned
into everything else.

23:48.279 --> 23:51.515
If we can't see the pattern
in God's architecture,

23:51.549 --> 23:54.484
it's because we're not
looking closely enough.

23:55.419 --> 23:57.253
Would you like
your sketches back?

23:58.188 --> 24:00.056
Of all of Lorenzo's
treasures,

24:00.090 --> 24:03.159
it was this bit of carved
stone that caught your eye.

24:04.194 --> 24:08.364
Has your husband ever mentioned it to you?
Where it came from.

24:08.398 --> 24:10.466
I believe he inherited it.

24:10.500 --> 24:14.303
Perhaps from a man
in the next room.

24:15.138 --> 24:16.873
A magician.

24:16.907 --> 24:20.043
Lorenzo's grandfather.
Cosimo.

24:20.077 --> 24:22.812
He ruled this city
without ever holding office.

24:23.781 --> 24:26.649
Oh, there's something
about him.

24:26.683 --> 24:29.151
You're welcome to study him
at any time.

24:29.887 --> 24:33.623
But for now I'd rather you
returned to your guns. No?

24:35.225 --> 24:38.562
I didn't come to Florence
to live under Roman rule.

24:50.909 --> 24:52.910
DaVinci.

24:53.678 --> 24:55.912
A treat. For indulging me.

25:01.119 --> 25:03.320
Thank you for meeting
with me -

25:03.355 --> 25:06.424
especially with all
the concerns about Rome.

25:06.458 --> 25:11.696
I know this is unorthodox, but
circumstances forced my hand.

25:12.698 --> 25:15.466
You know what's happened
to Becchi.

25:15.501 --> 25:18.136
The accusations
that have been made.

25:19.204 --> 25:21.439
I don't believe
he's a traitor.

25:21.473 --> 25:23.574
What do you want me to do?

25:24.576 --> 25:27.178
Clarice has already agreed
to advocate for Becchi.

25:27.212 --> 25:31.282
You own the other half of my brother's heart.
Will you do the same?

25:32.050 --> 25:34.752
Are you so sure
he's innocent?

25:34.786 --> 25:36.987
I believe we can prove it.

25:37.022 --> 25:39.123
Becchi has been
giving me counsel.

25:39.157 --> 25:42.326
Working with him, I know
we can trap the real traitor.

25:44.663 --> 25:47.164
Please, Signora.

26:09.788 --> 26:12.256
Temperature's right.

26:12.290 --> 26:14.325
Leo.

26:15.761 --> 26:18.530
The fat-kidneyed foreman
requires your help.

26:18.564 --> 26:21.432
What do we know
of Lorenzo's ancestors?

26:23.469 --> 26:25.637
His father was a good,
but sickly, man.

26:25.671 --> 26:29.908
Who lived in the shadow
of his father...Cosimo.

26:29.942 --> 26:32.477
Wow. Really? How in fuck
does this matter?

26:32.511 --> 26:34.245
Rome's mercenaries
are upon us.

26:34.279 --> 26:36.447
Clarice Orsini
gave me this today.

26:38.717 --> 26:40.819
She said Lorenzo
inherited it.

26:41.921 --> 26:43.488
You're exhausted.
Look at you.

26:43.522 --> 26:46.958
Fixating on bric-a-brac when we
need more guns. It's insane.

26:46.992 --> 26:51.529
The keys on it are identical
to the ones from the Jew.

26:53.465 --> 26:55.934
The Vault of Heaven.
The Book of Leaves.

26:57.670 --> 27:00.204
How do the Medicis
figure into it all?

27:01.406 --> 27:05.509
Leo, I just don't see how a
fucking mantelpiece antique

27:05.543 --> 27:07.978
keeps Riario's swords
from our fucking necks.

27:08.013 --> 27:11.048
Christ, Zo. Can you just
drop it for one minute?

27:12.817 --> 27:16.320
Do you have to prove your
ignorance so damn often?

27:20.458 --> 27:24.828
When the Byzantine Empire
used the first cannons

27:24.862 --> 27:28.965
against the Ottomans during
the siege of Constantinople,

27:29.000 --> 27:30.534
the Turks
were forced to flee.

27:30.568 --> 27:34.537
30 years later, they returned
with cannons of their own.

27:34.572 --> 27:35.972
Bigger cannons.

27:36.006 --> 27:41.010
And after a 55-day siege
left such destruction...

27:42.112 --> 27:44.313
..that the city
will never be the same.

27:47.251 --> 27:49.919
Constantinople fell.

27:50.988 --> 27:54.123
Then we've always got to make sure
we've got the biggest cannon.

27:54.158 --> 27:55.692
Oh...

27:59.364 --> 28:01.031
It never ends.

28:06.304 --> 28:08.305
Unless...

28:09.741 --> 28:12.776
Unless I end it here.

28:12.810 --> 28:14.744
Don't! That will cause
an explosion!

28:14.779 --> 28:16.646
- Don't!
- Aargh!

28:41.239 --> 28:43.374
Maestro, what have you done?

28:44.542 --> 28:46.810
Sealed our fucking fate.

29:02.861 --> 29:05.063
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

29:05.097 --> 29:07.966
How long has it been
since your last confession?

29:11.337 --> 29:14.739
I'm...embarrassed to say.

29:14.774 --> 29:16.207
Nearly a year.

29:16.242 --> 29:18.243
Oh.

29:18.277 --> 29:21.546
I have spoken with many shamed
penitents tonight, child.

29:21.580 --> 29:24.449
The wheel reminds people
of the punishments

29:24.483 --> 29:27.685
awaiting those not reconciled
with Our Father.

29:28.720 --> 29:30.722
It's horrid.

29:31.857 --> 29:37.329
I fear I myself drive someone
toward a similar agony.

29:38.064 --> 29:41.232
Every daughter of Eve
faces the same dilemma.

29:43.769 --> 29:46.137
I have been untrue.

29:47.940 --> 29:51.176
And now someone else
is suffering for it.

29:53.045 --> 29:56.881
And he will endure
unimaginable pain...

29:58.818 --> 30:00.852
- ..and it's my fault.
- If I may.

30:02.855 --> 30:06.525
I have heard something of
the state of your marriage.

30:06.559 --> 30:09.794
If you can offer up,
even the smallest,

30:09.829 --> 30:12.997
the tenderest bit of mercy,

30:13.032 --> 30:16.167
I have no doubt
it will be taken very well.

30:17.068 --> 30:19.737
- Mercy has its risks.
- And rewards.

30:35.688 --> 30:37.655
Liar!

30:39.691 --> 30:43.862
"Good people of Florence, the
Medicis are leading you to death."

30:43.896 --> 30:46.698
You have to give Riario
some credit.

30:46.733 --> 30:49.167
He knows
how to intimidate his prey.

30:49.202 --> 30:53.038
People say Riario has
2,000 men to burn the city.

30:53.072 --> 30:55.240
I heard 3,000.

30:55.274 --> 30:59.245
The city will be safe.
I'll make sure of it.

30:59.279 --> 31:01.747
Pride is a deadly sin,
Artista.

31:04.985 --> 31:06.719
Il Capitano!

31:07.721 --> 31:10.089
I didn't take you
for a religious zealot.

31:10.124 --> 31:14.361
A bully and an asshole, yes.
A zealot?

31:14.395 --> 31:15.829
It's...

31:15.863 --> 31:18.165
I'm zealous about my family.

31:18.199 --> 31:21.668
We pray every night that you're not
leading this city to destruction.

31:22.704 --> 31:25.305
What? I have
that much power, do I?

31:25.340 --> 31:29.343
We've had nothing but trouble since you
talked your way into the Medici court.

31:29.377 --> 31:32.213
Perhaps God is on the Count's
side in this business.

31:32.247 --> 31:34.949
I don't believe in any god

31:34.984 --> 31:37.018
who would side
with that pig's bladder.

31:37.053 --> 31:39.988
You blaspheme.

31:40.022 --> 31:44.826
Men like you artistic perverts are
turning Florence into Gomorrah.

31:44.860 --> 31:49.597
You're beating a quick path to the everlasting
bonfire and dragging us all with you.

31:51.533 --> 31:53.934
I'll send you to the bonfire
even sooner.

31:55.971 --> 31:59.072
I know you're a better
swordsman than I, DaVinci.

31:59.107 --> 32:01.241
Still...

32:03.978 --> 32:06.280
..I've struck the bone, eh?

32:07.882 --> 32:10.484
Do you really want to blunt
the edge of your blade on me

32:10.518 --> 32:14.121
when you may need it sharp
for Riario?

32:14.155 --> 32:16.490
You're drunk, Leonardo.

32:56.897 --> 32:59.099
Come on!

33:02.703 --> 33:04.704
Oh, my God.

33:33.836 --> 33:35.637
Jesus.

33:50.253 --> 33:52.888
I heard what happened
at the metal works.

33:55.025 --> 33:57.226
You're better than this,
Leonardo.

33:58.562 --> 34:01.764
I thought I could save
Florence. I thought...

34:01.799 --> 34:04.567
my talents would be enough,
but they aren't.

34:05.636 --> 34:07.670
I've got nothing.

34:09.507 --> 34:11.908
And because of me,

34:11.943 --> 34:15.779
tomorrow morning, Lorenzo
will be forced to surrender.

34:15.813 --> 34:20.016
No, please. Florence and Rome have
been at it since before you were born.

34:20.051 --> 34:22.552
- It's politics.
- No, it's...

34:22.587 --> 34:24.688
It's personal.

34:26.389 --> 34:28.391
I have something they want.

34:28.425 --> 34:31.226
Yes. Your talent.

34:31.261 --> 34:34.530
The Pope wants my talent.

34:35.632 --> 34:38.100
Riario wants my key.

34:39.768 --> 34:42.204
- What key?
- The key from...

34:45.875 --> 34:47.876
Nothing.

34:52.782 --> 34:54.783
Come here.

34:56.284 --> 34:58.420
If something burdens you...

35:01.524 --> 35:04.092
..maybe it's better
just to let it go.

35:43.166 --> 35:45.267
Wait. Wait.

35:46.269 --> 35:47.937
What?

35:47.971 --> 35:50.439
That's what Lorenzo
requires of me.

36:43.426 --> 36:45.894
Why did you
destroy your guns?

36:52.200 --> 36:53.568
Lorenzo.

36:53.602 --> 36:58.038
He looked me in the eye and
told me I was an inventor.

37:03.812 --> 37:06.347
But this isn't invention.
This is...

37:08.950 --> 37:12.053
It's escalation.
I build five, they build 50.

37:19.528 --> 37:21.963
You might be the loveliest
man I've ever known.

37:24.666 --> 37:26.835
Hey.

37:30.172 --> 37:32.373
Why do you say it
with such sadness?

37:36.277 --> 37:39.379
Maybe it's because I think
none of us are worthy of you.

37:44.319 --> 37:46.019
Why the pomegranates?

37:46.054 --> 37:48.155
I don't know yet.

37:51.126 --> 37:53.393
Do you know...

37:53.428 --> 37:59.533
Now...Hades tricked Persephone
into eating pomegranates,

37:59.567 --> 38:01.969
when she left the underworld.

38:02.770 --> 38:08.175
She said that their magic
forced her to return to him.

38:08.209 --> 38:10.243
It's true.

38:13.749 --> 38:16.117
You should take one with you
when you go.

38:19.421 --> 38:23.491
It's not magic that binds me
to you, Leonardo.

38:34.004 --> 38:37.540
I hope you kill
that bastard Riario.

38:41.412 --> 38:43.546
Leonardo!

38:44.048 --> 38:46.182
Leonardo!

38:47.318 --> 38:49.753
Leonardo!

38:49.787 --> 38:52.622
Oh, so you have the gall
to remain in Florence?

38:52.657 --> 38:55.559
You're either brave
or unimaginably stupid.

38:55.593 --> 38:57.327
A bit of both.

38:59.563 --> 39:01.997
You sabotage our efforts.
Why?

39:02.032 --> 39:03.532
The guns wouldn't have
ended this.

39:03.566 --> 39:07.435
With all your experience in waging
war, you decided that, did you?

39:07.469 --> 39:09.503
You little...

39:10.339 --> 39:12.207
Fuck!

39:12.241 --> 39:14.209
I can't believe
I trusted you.

39:14.243 --> 39:18.813
You, a bastard. A charlatan.
A peddler of knick-knacks!

39:18.847 --> 39:22.316
My brother was right. I was a
fool to believe in you. A fool!

39:22.350 --> 39:26.987
My only recourse is to offer
myself as Riario's hostage

39:27.022 --> 39:30.324
and I'll have to pray that if
I put myself at his mercy,

39:30.358 --> 39:33.460
that he will forego
pillaging Florence.

39:33.495 --> 39:38.799
I'll have to pray that he'll grant
Clarice and our children safe passage.

39:38.834 --> 39:44.538
And I'll have to pray that every
trace of my name and my legacy

39:44.572 --> 39:47.074
isn't struck
from the streets!

39:50.779 --> 39:56.518
You gather what little you hold
dear and you meet me in the field.

39:56.552 --> 40:00.789
I want you by my side when I am
forced to accept Rome's terms.

40:00.823 --> 40:02.690
And if Riario wants you...

40:03.725 --> 40:05.827
..he can fucking have you.

40:39.730 --> 40:43.333
Nico, it is good
to see you again.

40:43.367 --> 40:45.569
I trust your hand is mending.

40:45.603 --> 40:48.005
Let us go straight to
the terms of surrender.

40:49.040 --> 40:50.774
Indeed.

40:50.809 --> 40:52.976
I have certain...

40:53.011 --> 40:55.713
require certain assurances.

40:57.616 --> 41:00.217
Florence and its citizens
are my chief concern...

41:00.252 --> 41:01.852
Sorry. Sorry.

41:01.886 --> 41:07.157
Um, we are clear whose surrender
we're discussing here?

41:09.727 --> 41:11.828
It's yours.

41:11.862 --> 41:14.297
DaVinci...

41:14.331 --> 41:17.766
Nico, would you show the Count
and Captain General our gift?

41:18.701 --> 41:22.771
Now, since you'd calculated
the capacity of my guns,

41:22.805 --> 41:25.507
I've endeavored to improve
Florence's odds.

41:26.175 --> 41:27.906
It's a question
of mathematics.

41:27.940 --> 41:33.140
How to pack a group of spheres
in the most economic fashion.

41:33.174 --> 41:38.245
And since nature always employs the most
efficient means to achieve her ends,

41:38.279 --> 41:40.914
I've taken inspiration
from her.

41:41.749 --> 41:45.084
I call it
the cluster bombard.

41:52.824 --> 41:56.626
The casing houses a grouping
of smaller explosives,

41:56.660 --> 41:58.194
an Archimedean solid,

41:58.228 --> 42:00.796
which is separated
by iron spacers.

42:00.830 --> 42:06.134
So when the bombard lands, it fragments
into a fountain of shrapnel.

42:06.168 --> 42:10.405
I estimate one bombard could take out
a dozen of your men and their mounts.

42:10.439 --> 42:13.341
Now, I know
what you're thinking.

42:14.110 --> 42:16.745
You're thinking,
"Well, fair enough.

42:16.779 --> 42:20.449
A bombard's really only as good
as one's ability to lob it."

42:20.483 --> 42:23.585
So, fair enough.
You'd be right.

42:24.987 --> 42:26.521
However...

42:27.823 --> 42:29.624
Zo!

42:29.659 --> 42:31.293
Let's go.

42:47.476 --> 42:49.277
Impressive.

42:50.380 --> 42:54.850
But how do I know that
contraption even works?

42:54.884 --> 42:57.553
Allow me to demonstrate
on a smaller scale.

42:57.587 --> 43:00.056
First, we light the bombard.

43:00.858 --> 43:05.262
Then we fire it...like so.

43:16.474 --> 43:22.980
The real, full-scale bombard doesn't
carry fireworks, of course.

43:23.015 --> 43:26.350
We will rain flame and
destruction down on your men

43:26.385 --> 43:29.320
recalling Biblical
devastation of old.

43:29.354 --> 43:32.724
The peasants will pick the
bone fragments of your men

43:32.758 --> 43:35.460
from these fields
for decades to come.

43:36.229 --> 43:41.500
You...everything you've accomplished,
will fade from memory.

43:41.534 --> 43:45.537
Whereas our victory will be
lionized for centuries.

43:45.572 --> 43:47.673
Perhaps.

43:48.675 --> 43:51.844
Or perhaps regardless
of what happens today,

43:51.878 --> 43:56.147
the opposite tale will be
told, or no tale at all.

43:57.717 --> 44:00.219
You see,
a man once told me...

44:02.222 --> 44:04.623
..History is a lie.

44:27.013 --> 44:29.247
Well played, Artista.

44:33.919 --> 44:36.688
You'd... You'd do well
to remember, though,

44:36.722 --> 44:40.291
that a war is waged
on many fronts.

44:44.997 --> 44:47.098
Hyah! Hyah!

44:47.934 --> 44:50.469
You pulled off quite a feat,
Leonardo.

44:50.503 --> 44:53.605
I would have liked to see it fire.
Imagine the carnage.

44:53.640 --> 44:57.009
Rome would have been
holding funerals for months.

44:58.778 --> 45:01.347
The crossbow -
it doesn't actually work.

45:05.319 --> 45:08.621
It's more a feat of art
than weaponry.

45:12.860 --> 45:14.695
This sham...

45:14.729 --> 45:17.031
is the work of
drunken artists.

45:17.065 --> 45:20.034
They're more skilled in
stage props than armaments.

45:20.068 --> 45:23.304
How can we have built
the real device in one night?

45:24.172 --> 45:30.150
Even if I had, the drawstring needed to fire
the damn thing would have been ludicrous.

45:31.086 --> 45:34.021
- Look at it.
- You wagered our fate on a bluff?

45:34.990 --> 45:37.825
- I did.
- You only bought us a temporary reprieve.

45:37.859 --> 45:40.895
You can't keep on
bluffing Rome forever.

45:40.929 --> 45:42.463
Can't we?

45:43.265 --> 45:46.167
Life's precious, Lorenzo.

45:47.036 --> 45:49.370
Even a traitor's.

45:49.405 --> 45:51.873
I believe...

45:51.908 --> 45:54.776
it was your grandfather,
Cosimo...

45:56.413 --> 45:58.914
..who voiced
a pertinent sentiment.

45:58.949 --> 46:02.051
"We read that we ought
to forgive our enemies.

46:03.454 --> 46:07.390
We do not read that we ought
to forgive our friends."

46:34.384 --> 46:36.718
Sorry, brother.
I was just having a rest.

46:37.920 --> 46:40.555
Have you come to minister
to the condemned?

46:41.957 --> 46:43.758
Right.

47:00.676 --> 47:04.412
I appreciate the visit but I've
already made peace with my maker.

47:20.763 --> 47:21.896
Signora.

47:23.566 --> 47:24.933
You.

47:24.967 --> 47:28.637
You're the one that slipped those
documents into my quarters.

47:31.040 --> 47:33.275
How long have they owned you?

47:33.309 --> 47:35.343
A few years.

47:37.313 --> 47:39.314
Then they approached you...

47:39.348 --> 47:42.150
Before Lorenzo and I
were involved.

47:44.653 --> 47:47.755
Whatever promise they made,
they will not honor it.

47:48.591 --> 47:51.693
You have no idea

47:51.728 --> 47:53.929
of my circumstances.

47:53.963 --> 47:57.532
There's more to this
than Florence or Rome,

47:57.567 --> 47:59.634
or my life.

47:59.669 --> 48:02.270
Why are you here, Signora?

48:05.074 --> 48:09.377
Because I do not wish
to see you broken on a wheel.

48:12.448 --> 48:14.015
What?

48:16.285 --> 48:18.319
Hemlock.

48:19.355 --> 48:20.622
How?

48:20.656 --> 48:24.259
A weapon stolen from the Secret
Archives in the Vatican.

48:25.461 --> 48:29.264
A misericorde, modified
with a single dose of poison.

48:29.298 --> 48:31.800
Its bite is almost
never noticed.

48:32.468 --> 48:35.203
So no evidence will arise

48:35.238 --> 48:38.106
implicating Lorenzo's lover.

48:38.141 --> 48:40.242
Consider it mercy.

48:41.077 --> 48:44.280
This is the fastest and most
painless death I can offer.

48:44.314 --> 48:45.881
And I will see that it takes.

48:45.916 --> 48:47.917
This isn't mercy.

48:47.951 --> 48:51.387
This is you...
tying off loose ends.

48:59.797 --> 49:02.231
Rome chose well.

49:05.235 --> 49:06.869
- Guard!
- I'm sorry.

49:08.806 --> 49:11.007
I wish there was another way.

49:22.385 --> 49:23.585
Becchi!

49:25.955 --> 49:27.355
Guards!

49:28.023 --> 49:30.258
Guards, quickly!

49:38.299 --> 49:39.800
Hemlock.

49:39.834 --> 49:43.036
- Becchi would not have done this.
- The vial speaks for itself.

49:43.071 --> 49:45.873
And you have a history
of not believing things

49:45.907 --> 49:48.675
that Becchi has clearly done.

49:51.713 --> 49:53.714
Question is, brother,

49:53.748 --> 49:56.049
who brought Becchi
this poison?

49:56.885 --> 50:00.921
Was it someone who
sympathizes with his plight?

50:03.524 --> 50:07.460
If I were to defy you, brother,
I wouldn't don a mask to do it.

50:08.462 --> 50:09.896
But what do you care?

50:09.930 --> 50:13.399
The traitor is dead,
Florence is secure

50:13.434 --> 50:15.468
and you've a war engineer
to fete.

50:15.502 --> 50:18.704
All is well
in the Republic tonight.

50:21.709 --> 50:23.844
The names and charges
written on this paper

50:23.878 --> 50:26.714
require our immediate
attention as Priori.

50:26.748 --> 50:28.683
An anonymous denunciation?

50:28.717 --> 50:30.552
The author's unimportant.

50:30.586 --> 50:32.787
This matter demands
investigation.

50:32.822 --> 50:35.624
I'd caution you to consider
who will be implicated.

50:35.658 --> 50:38.127
As Priori, you are duty bound
to uphold the law,

50:38.161 --> 50:40.696
unconcerned by who whomever
it may incriminate.

50:41.598 --> 50:44.233
Interrogate the victim
mentioned here, Captain.

50:44.267 --> 50:48.437
Once he confirms the charges,
make your arrest.

50:51.141 --> 50:53.942
Wow, look at you!

50:53.977 --> 50:57.245
Venetian breeches, bit of
velvet, bit of brocade.

50:57.279 --> 50:59.614
Did you buy those
with your Medici vouchers?

50:59.648 --> 51:01.950
What concern is it of yours?

51:01.984 --> 51:04.419
Who traded in chits
to muster the men

51:04.453 --> 51:07.588
to sneak your phony crossbow
out of the city? Hm?

51:07.623 --> 51:11.059
Who assembled all the pieces in the
middle of the night, risking his life?

51:11.093 --> 51:14.062
Cos it wasn't Nico. Yet somehow
that little bull's pizzle

51:14.096 --> 51:16.899
wins an invitation to Lorenzo's
palazzo and I don't.

51:16.933 --> 51:19.768
Nico hasn't been arrested a
dozen times for lewd behavior,

51:19.802 --> 51:22.070
and pickpocketing,
grave robbing.

51:22.105 --> 51:25.140
I can't have you there
tonight, Zo. Sorry.

51:25.175 --> 51:27.742
These people...

51:27.777 --> 51:30.211
decorum means everything
to them.

51:33.215 --> 51:35.350
Where is your guest of honor,
Lorenzo?

51:35.385 --> 51:38.153
If we're to praise an artist, perhaps
it should be Signor Botticelli.

51:38.188 --> 51:40.522
At least he has blessed up
with his presence.

51:40.557 --> 51:44.226
No need to honor someone who honors
themselves so well, brother.

51:46.563 --> 51:50.266
Every time I find myself looking
for DaVinci, he seems to have...

51:50.300 --> 51:52.101
vanished like smoke.

52:08.419 --> 52:11.454
Is there a reason you're
avoiding the party, Maestro?

52:11.489 --> 52:13.523
It's being held
in your honor.

52:14.291 --> 52:16.660
Something's needling me,
Nico.

52:17.629 --> 52:19.263
Till I can discover
what it...

52:22.567 --> 52:25.068
Ha!

52:25.102 --> 52:26.970
Yes!

52:28.406 --> 52:30.507
The old magician's laughing.

52:31.375 --> 52:33.844
I'm an idiot.

52:33.878 --> 52:36.646
The symbols
couldn't be clearer.

52:37.415 --> 52:41.251
I am a son of Earth
and Starry Heaven.

52:41.285 --> 52:46.056
I am thirsty. Please give me something
to drink from the fountain of Memory.

52:46.825 --> 52:48.926
The invocation for
the Sons of Mithras. Look.

52:48.960 --> 52:50.561
A bull pulling a plow.

52:51.196 --> 52:54.899
Christian iconography but it's
also the pagan symbol for Earth.

52:56.468 --> 52:58.870
A star-filled heaven.

52:58.904 --> 53:01.539
A chalice,
symbolic of a fountain.

53:02.274 --> 53:06.511
And flowers.
Ne M'oubliez Pas, in French.

53:06.545 --> 53:08.279
Forget-me-nots.

53:09.415 --> 53:11.216
Memory.

53:11.250 --> 53:13.452
Cosimo de Medici...

53:14.354 --> 53:16.588
..was a Son of Mithras.

53:16.623 --> 53:19.458
It's as if all my inquiries
are converging.

53:19.493 --> 53:22.895
It's as if a grand web
is being spun.

53:22.929 --> 53:25.965
One so incalculably
wide and ancient

53:25.999 --> 53:28.367
that I'm only now beginning
to grasp its scope.

53:29.202 --> 53:32.071
I have proven myself
to Lorenzo.

53:32.105 --> 53:34.107
I've earned his trust.

53:34.141 --> 53:36.743
It's time for him
to repay me in kind.

53:36.777 --> 53:38.244
By doing what?

53:38.279 --> 53:40.746
By funding an expedition.

53:40.781 --> 53:43.549
To the land indicated
on the Jew's map.

53:43.584 --> 53:45.952
A ship, provisions
for a journey.

53:45.986 --> 53:49.822
The Vault of Heaven
is out there, Nico.

53:49.856 --> 53:51.557
It's harboring
the Book of Leaves.

53:51.591 --> 53:54.660
All the knowledge it contains,
I can hear it calling to me.

53:54.695 --> 53:57.964
And the magician
is leading me to it.

53:57.998 --> 54:01.235
My grandfather,
Cosimo, had a dream.

54:02.570 --> 54:07.909
That our streets and squares would be a
haven for science, art and learning.

54:07.943 --> 54:14.349
No son of Florence better represents
those ideas than Leonardo DaVinci.

54:16.886 --> 54:18.653
I name you...

54:19.788 --> 54:23.891
..Grand Master of the Order
of St John the Baptist,

54:24.893 --> 54:27.895
patron saint of Florence.

54:28.930 --> 54:32.967
I give you the living embodiment
of classical brilliance.

54:33.001 --> 54:35.402
Leonardo DaVinci.

54:42.977 --> 54:46.580
Please, Maestro, won't you
grant us a few words?

54:53.155 --> 54:56.958
Florence's greatest export
has always been its ideas.

54:56.992 --> 55:00.995
Our Republic represents
the cutting edge of inquiry.

55:03.365 --> 55:06.634
We are inventing the future.

55:08.737 --> 55:12.807
But we can only remain vital if
we keep on pushing outwards,

55:12.841 --> 55:15.343
so I propose a bold new step.

55:16.912 --> 55:20.014
I have learned of a land, your
Magnificence, to the west.

55:20.049 --> 55:23.985
It's largely uncharted but it's
certain to contain wonders.

55:24.019 --> 55:27.822
Now, with your patronage,
I shall mount an expedition.

55:28.924 --> 55:31.326
We will voyage...

55:34.163 --> 55:36.898
Captain Dragonetti, what is
the meaning of this affront?

55:36.932 --> 55:38.700
My apologies, Signor.

55:38.734 --> 55:41.937
A grave accusation has been levied
against one of your guests.

55:41.971 --> 55:44.572
I know nothing
of any accusations.

55:44.607 --> 55:47.509
May I remind you, Nazzareno,
that you answer to me.

55:48.211 --> 55:51.513
Technically, I answer to the
Signoria, your Magnificence.

55:51.547 --> 55:53.849
Of which you are
but one voice.

55:55.385 --> 55:58.820
I couldn't dissuade them,
Signor. It's protocol.

55:58.855 --> 56:01.023
Our hands were tied.

56:03.126 --> 56:05.360
Go on then, Captain.

56:06.896 --> 56:09.565
It has come to the attention
of the Officers of the Night,

56:09.599 --> 56:12.568
by means of
secret denunciation,

56:12.602 --> 56:16.571
that one Leonardo
di ser Piero DaVinci

56:16.605 --> 56:20.475
has committed, in violation of the
statutes of the Republic of Florence,

56:20.509 --> 56:24.713
and divine and natural law,
the grievous act of sodomy.

56:26.683 --> 56:28.950
Said individual is to be
immediately remanded...

56:28.985 --> 56:30.819
These are lies.
This is slander!

56:30.853 --> 56:32.487
..whereupon he will remain

56:32.521 --> 56:36.224
until the Magistrates ascertain
his guilt or innocence.

56:36.258 --> 56:38.226
Should he be found guilty,

56:38.261 --> 56:41.262
he will be led through the public
squares to the Palace of Justice

56:41.297 --> 56:44.866
and there be burned
so that he dies...

56:45.634 --> 56:48.202
..and his body
is separated from his soul.

56:49.938 --> 56:52.172
No! You...

56:53.141 --> 56:54.842
This is your work, Francesco.

56:54.876 --> 56:57.611
I smell the Pazzi stench
all over this charade.

56:57.646 --> 57:00.548
The denunciation is real,
Lorenzo.

57:00.582 --> 57:02.717
We've a victim
willing to testify.

57:02.751 --> 57:06.253
No-one has been sentenced for this
crime for more than 50 years.

57:06.287 --> 57:09.424
And yet it's still
on the statute books.

57:09.458 --> 57:12.660
If you've issues with it, take
it up with your forebear Cosimo.

57:12.694 --> 57:15.262
Was it not he who revised
Florence's constitution?

57:15.297 --> 57:18.499
Or would you flout our fair
Republic's laws as you see fit?

57:18.534 --> 57:22.003
I was under the impression
we lived in a democracy.

57:23.105 --> 57:26.709
- Not a dictatorship.
- Your wrists, Signor.

57:39.255 --> 57:44.293
I told you you'd beat a quick
path to the bonfire, Artista.
