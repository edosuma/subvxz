00:25.358 --> 00:26.620
Good day to you.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.661
Good day to you.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.795
Good morning, Tom.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.459
Good morning, Grace.

00:35.568 --> 00:37.126
So, where are you heading?

00:37.237 --> 00:39.171
Uh, Sullivan's.
Care to join me?

00:39.239 --> 00:41.503
Oh, l wish l could,
but there's a bit of a problem.

00:41.574 --> 00:43.007
Oh, really?

00:43.076 --> 00:44.668
Well, you see,
Tommy, me boy,

00:44.744 --> 00:47.178
the good Lord blessed me
with a fine wife.

00:47.247 --> 00:49.010
l'll never forget
the day l met her.

00:49.082 --> 00:51.175
l was on me way
to the fair in Dooleen...

00:51.251 --> 00:52.878
or was it Kilkee?

00:52.952 --> 00:54.010
There's some fine

00:54.120 --> 00:56.020
trout fishing to be had
in Kilkee this time of year.

00:56.089 --> 00:58.023
Who said anything
about trout?

00:58.091 --> 00:59.991
Timothy Ryan,
God rest his soul.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.925
He was one for the trout.

01:01.961 --> 01:03.428
The poor man's
been dead a fortnight.

01:03.463 --> 01:04.760
Some say he had the croup,

01:04.831 --> 01:05.889
but don't you believe it.

01:05.965 --> 01:08.593
The widow Moore
gave him the evil eye.

01:08.701 --> 01:10.328
And... your point?

01:10.437 --> 01:12.405
Me wife and l- - 
well, we've hit

01:12.505 --> 01:13.733
a bit of a rough patch.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.774
A better woman never walked
the face of the earth.

01:15.842 --> 01:17.469
She threw you out again.

01:17.544 --> 01:19.478
With nothing but the clothes
on me back.

01:19.546 --> 01:20.308
How much?

01:20.380 --> 01:23.440
A shilling or two
should suffice.

01:23.516 --> 01:24.778
Keep the change.

01:24.851 --> 01:26.648
God bless you, Tommy, me boy.

01:35.028 --> 01:37.121
Harry...

01:37.197 --> 01:39.290
weren't you supposed
to meet me at Sullivan's?

01:39.365 --> 01:41.128
Oh, sorry,
l got distracted

01:41.234 --> 01:42.963
by the, uh, scenery.

01:43.069 --> 01:44.297
This is Maggie.

01:44.404 --> 01:46.668
We've met. Could you excuse us?

01:46.739 --> 01:48.297
Charmed to have met you, Harry.

01:48.408 --> 01:50.342
Charmed.

01:50.410 --> 01:51.502
What's the hurry?

01:51.578 --> 01:52.840
A word to the wise- -

01:52.912 --> 01:55.346
stay away from
Maggie O'Halloran.

01:55.415 --> 01:56.507
She's promised
to a pig farmer

01:56.583 --> 01:58.517
with a very large rake.

01:58.585 --> 01:59.415
Well, does she have a sister?

01:59.486 --> 02:00.316
Wooden teeth.

02:00.386 --> 02:01.375
Oh, nothing an little...

02:01.454 --> 02:02.648
adjustment
to the holo- matrix

02:02.722 --> 02:03.689
wouldn't fix.

02:03.756 --> 02:05.155
No, no, l'm not
changing a thing.

02:05.225 --> 02:07.557
Fair Haven is perfect
just the way it is.

02:07.627 --> 02:10.061
Tommy boy, you forgot
the leprechauns.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.392
Yeah. No.

02:11.464 --> 02:14.228
No leprechauns, no
aliens, no starships.

02:14.334 --> 02:17.064
l want this to be a place
where the crew can unwind.

02:17.170 --> 02:19.104
Morning, lads.

02:19.172 --> 02:21.732
Ah, heard any good
confessions lately?

02:21.841 --> 02:24.537
Doctor/patient confidentiality,
Mr. Paris.

02:24.611 --> 02:26.772
Harry hasn't seen
Sullivan's yet.

02:26.846 --> 02:27.938
Do you care to join us?

02:28.081 --> 02:29.275
Don't mind if l do.

02:29.349 --> 02:31.943
l'll need to leave
no later than 1300 hours.

02:32.018 --> 02:33.610
Medical emergency?

02:33.686 --> 02:34.618
Not exactly.

02:34.687 --> 02:37.884
l'm working on my homily
for Sunday's mass,

02:37.957 --> 02:39.254
and l expect
both you sinners...

02:39.325 --> 02:41.850
to be in attendance.

02:43.863 --> 02:44.955
He's kidding, right?

02:45.031 --> 02:48.330
You wanted authenticity.

04:40.179 --> 04:42.272
Everybody, place your bets!

04:42.348 --> 04:43.781
Three bob on Liam.

04:43.850 --> 04:44.782
Three bob it is.

04:44.851 --> 04:46.113
Five shillings on Liam.

04:46.185 --> 04:47.948
You're going to hurt
Harry's feelings.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.613
Oh, very well.

04:49.689 --> 04:51.122
Two shillings on Mr. Kim,

04:51.190 --> 04:52.623
and l'll pray for a miracle.

04:52.692 --> 04:54.785
Excuse me, Father, but l needed
a bit of counsel.

04:54.861 --> 04:55.793
l'm off duty right now.

04:55.862 --> 04:57.955
But l've broken the
Fifth Commandment again.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.226
Say ten ''Our Fathers''
and call me in the morning.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.029
- Oh, thank you, Father.
- Gentlemen.

05:04.604 --> 05:06.663
Come on, come on, Mr. Kim.

05:06.773 --> 05:08.968
Show him what for.
You can do it.

05:19.952 --> 05:21.385
What'll it be?

05:21.454 --> 05:23.046
l'm looking
for some friends of mine.

05:23.122 --> 05:24.555
Well, we're all friends here.

05:24.624 --> 05:26.888
Well, then,
have you seen Tom Paris?

05:26.993 --> 05:29.723
He's right over there
with young Harry.

05:29.796 --> 05:30.888
Poor sod.

05:30.963 --> 05:32.726
l'm afraid no
one's whipped Liam

05:32.799 --> 05:33.891
in three years.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.730
There's a first time
for everything.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.770
An optimist, are you?

05:38.838 --> 05:41.204
A realist.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.538
Come on, Ensign, try!

05:45.611 --> 05:47.545
Try!

05:47.613 --> 05:50.548
Come on, me boy, push, push!

05:50.616 --> 05:51.947
l'm trying!

05:52.018 --> 05:54.486
Come on! Try harder!

05:54.554 --> 05:56.283
You got him! You got him, lad!
You got him!

06:00.760 --> 06:02.159
What?! What
in God's name...?!

06:02.228 --> 06:03.525
Come on, Liam, push!

06:05.398 --> 06:06.888
Yes! Yes!

06:08.501 --> 06:10.492
l knew you could do it, Ensign.

06:10.603 --> 06:12.537
So, this is the program

06:12.605 --> 06:14.368
l've been hearing
so much about.

06:14.440 --> 06:15.998
Welcome, weary traveler.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.872
You have outdone yourself

06:17.944 --> 06:18.876
this time.

06:18.945 --> 06:20.207
Everything is authentic

06:20.279 --> 06:22.543
except for one tiny detail.

06:22.615 --> 06:23.877
Oh?

06:23.950 --> 06:26.817
The harp on the sign- - 
it's backwards.

06:28.654 --> 06:30.212
Oh. Everybody's a critic.

06:30.289 --> 06:31.620
As l recall, the Captain is

06:31.691 --> 06:33.886
quite an aficionado
of lrish history.

06:34.026 --> 06:35.220
l hate to break up the party,

06:35.294 --> 06:36.727
but we have some
business to attend to.

06:36.796 --> 06:38.730
There's a neutronic
wavefront approaching,

06:38.798 --> 06:40.231
class- 9.

06:40.299 --> 06:41.323
Class- 9?

06:42.435 --> 06:45.302
Sorry, boys, duty calls.

06:46.672 --> 06:49.232
Uh, ''wavefront''?

06:49.342 --> 06:51.435
Now, what in the name
of God is that?

06:51.511 --> 06:54.275
Um, a wee bit
of bad weather.

06:54.347 --> 06:56.474
Oh.

07:08.528 --> 07:10.325
Borg classification 3472,

07:10.396 --> 07:12.330
partical density anomaly.

07:12.398 --> 07:13.490
Where'd it come from?

07:13.566 --> 07:15.329
l believe it was formed
by the collision

07:15.435 --> 07:16.993
of two neutron stars.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.536
The wavefront is traveling

07:18.604 --> 07:21.368
at a velocity of 200,000
kilometers per second,

07:21.441 --> 07:24.205
and it extends
for 3.6 light- years.

07:24.277 --> 07:27.041
How long before it hits?

07:27.113 --> 07:29.047
Approximately 15 hours.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.548
We're already
feeling its effects.

07:30.616 --> 07:33.551
The neutron radiation
is disrupting plasma flow.

07:33.619 --> 07:34.881
We can't jump to warp.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.388
lmpulse power won't be enough
to outrun that thing.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.391
Then we'll have
to ride it out.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.723
We'll generate an
inverse warp field

07:41.794 --> 07:43.056
and drop anchor.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.893
That should protect us
from the turbulence.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.557
What about the radiation?

07:47.633 --> 07:48.725
lt'll only get worse.

07:48.835 --> 07:49.733
Have the Doctor

07:49.836 --> 07:51.269
prepare inoculations
for the crew.

07:51.337 --> 07:52.565
Go to Yellow Alert.

07:52.672 --> 07:53.900
Tom, B'Elanna, get started

07:54.006 --> 07:54.938
on converting the warp core.

07:55.007 --> 07:55.939
Yes, ma'am.

07:56.008 --> 07:58.476
Let's batten down the hatches.

08:06.552 --> 08:07.484
Captain.

08:07.553 --> 08:09.487
Just burning the midnight oil.

08:09.555 --> 08:11.147
Midnight's come and gone.

08:11.224 --> 08:13.158
Then it's time for a break.

08:13.226 --> 08:14.318
Do you mind?

08:14.393 --> 08:16.520
l could use the company.

08:18.898 --> 08:20.490
This approaching wavefront- -

08:20.566 --> 08:22.830
it's bringing back
some unpleasant memories.

08:22.935 --> 08:24.493
How so?

08:24.604 --> 08:26.538
You know l grew up
on a farm in lndiana.

08:26.606 --> 08:28.665
We used to have some
terrible thunderstorms

08:28.774 --> 08:30.207
during the summer months.

08:30.276 --> 08:31.868
At the first bolt of lightning,

08:31.944 --> 08:33.410
l'd bolt under the bed.

08:33.479 --> 08:36.380
We had some pretty nasty weather
on Talax, too.

08:36.448 --> 08:39.509
l- l always enjoyed
a good ion storm.

08:39.585 --> 08:41.347
Give me clear skies any day.

08:41.419 --> 08:43.547
Well, n- n- now
that you bring it up, uh,

08:43.623 --> 08:46.114
l am concerned
with keeping up morale

08:46.192 --> 08:47.557
over the next few days.

08:47.627 --> 08:49.891
The crew is not used
to sitting still.

08:49.962 --> 08:50.894
Suggestions?

08:50.963 --> 08:53.397
Everyone seems to love
Fair Haven.

08:53.466 --> 08:56.731
l was thinking we might initiate
an open- door protocol

08:56.836 --> 08:58.565
on the holodeck
and keep the program running

08:58.671 --> 09:01.799
24 hours a day, let people come
and go as they please.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.136
Permission granted.

09:03.209 --> 09:06.337
Fair Haven's just become
our port in the storm.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.311
l'm, uh, heading
down there myself

09:10.383 --> 09:11.645
if you'd like to join me.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.150
There's a charming little inn

09:13.219 --> 09:14.311
called The Ox and Lamb.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.150
The owner offered to share

09:16.222 --> 09:17.484
some of his recipes.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.821
No, thanks.
l still have work to do.

09:19.892 --> 09:22.520
Okay.

09:39.378 --> 09:41.175
What'll it be?

09:42.214 --> 09:44.580
A cup of tea would be nice.

09:44.650 --> 09:47.380
l just made one.

09:47.453 --> 09:50.422
- Cream?
- Please.

09:51.457 --> 09:55.894
So, what brings you
to Fair Haven, Miss...?

09:55.962 --> 09:56.894
Kathryn.

09:56.963 --> 09:59.056
l'm just passing
through...

09:59.131 --> 10:01.224
on my way home.

10:01.334 --> 10:03.268
How long have you been
on the road?

10:03.336 --> 10:06.772
Five years, almost six.

10:06.839 --> 10:08.807
- You must be homesick.
- No.

10:08.908 --> 10:13.140
Sometimes. Thank you.

10:16.349 --> 10:18.476
''Cead mil failte. ''

10:18.551 --> 10:20.178
Translation?

10:20.252 --> 10:21.446
''A hundred thousand
welcomes.''

10:21.520 --> 10:23.784
lt's an old lrish saying.

10:23.856 --> 10:25.483
We're all friends here.

10:27.526 --> 10:30.791
l had an aunt who used to
have a saying like that.

10:30.863 --> 10:34.094
''A stranger is a friend
you just haven't met yet.''

10:34.166 --> 10:35.292
Definitely lrish.

10:35.401 --> 10:37.426
She had an lrish temper, too.

10:37.536 --> 10:40.130
She and my uncle had
a place not far from here

10:40.239 --> 10:41.866
in County Clare.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.340
Ah... then you're
closer to home

10:44.410 --> 10:47.538
than you think, Katie O'Clare.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.377
You know, it's later
than l thought,

10:52.451 --> 10:53.850
and l've kept
you long enough.

10:53.919 --> 10:54.851
Oh, now, stay awhile.

10:54.920 --> 10:56.182
Didn't your auntie teach you

10:56.255 --> 10:59.247
that it's impolite to leave
without playing a game of rings?

10:59.325 --> 11:01.020
l really can't,
but thanks for the tea.

11:01.093 --> 11:02.651
Afraid you'd lose?

11:06.132 --> 11:08.327
l rarely lose.

11:09.435 --> 11:10.595
Prove it.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.906
One game.

11:18.978 --> 11:21.708
l'll set them up.

11:29.822 --> 11:30.754
Another ringer.

11:30.823 --> 11:32.120
Well, l'm not surprised.

11:32.191 --> 11:34.125
You stepped
over the beer stain.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.592
- l did not.
- You did, too,

11:35.661 --> 11:37.788
by half a boot,
and then you moved back,

11:37.863 --> 11:39.524
hoping l wouldn't notice.

11:39.598 --> 11:42.795
These boots are half a size
too large, so in reality,

11:42.902 --> 11:44.802
my toes never crossed the line.

11:44.870 --> 11:45.837
Your turn.

11:46.906 --> 11:48.737
For luck.

11:48.808 --> 11:50.537
Getting sweet with the rings
isn't going help you.

11:50.609 --> 11:52.839
We'll see.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.008
Damn!

11:55.114 --> 11:56.706
Devil won't help you, either.

11:56.782 --> 12:00.013
Well, maybe rings
aren't my forte after all.

12:00.052 --> 12:02.282
Would you care
to arm wrestle?

12:02.354 --> 12:04.219
That's not a woman's
game, Katie.

12:04.290 --> 12:05.222
You could get hurt.

12:05.291 --> 12:08.317
l'm stronger than l look.

12:08.394 --> 12:11.056
Ah!

12:11.130 --> 12:13.291
Now, that's quite
a grip you have.

12:13.365 --> 12:14.832
Not bad yourself.

12:17.837 --> 12:19.896
l couldn't help but notice
that you have your leg

12:20.005 --> 12:21.700
braced against the bar.

12:21.807 --> 12:25.504
Well, how else do you
expect me to win?

12:26.779 --> 12:29.179
Well, will we call it a draw?

12:30.249 --> 12:32.274
Sounds good to me.

12:34.320 --> 12:37.084
We run a foot race
down to the station and back?

12:40.192 --> 12:42.160
lt's good to make
a new friend.

12:42.228 --> 12:44.287
You have a nice way
about you.

12:44.363 --> 12:46.797
''Flattery's the
food of fools.''

12:46.866 --> 12:48.424
Another pearl of wisdom
from your auntie?

12:48.534 --> 12:51.469
No. Jonathan Swift.

12:51.537 --> 12:53.402
Swift? Never heard of him.

12:53.472 --> 12:55.599
He was an author.

12:55.708 --> 12:57.005
l was never one for reading.

12:57.076 --> 12:59.544
Well, that's too bad.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.876
Some of the greatest writers
in the world are lrish.

13:01.981 --> 13:05.576
Well, they say that Dr. Gilroy
has a library of books,

13:05.618 --> 13:07.882
and, well, next time
l see him,

13:07.953 --> 13:11.047
l'll ask him can l borrow
one or two?

13:11.123 --> 13:12.715
Good mornin'.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.886
Good mornin'.

13:15.961 --> 13:19.397
Oh, my God, will you
look at the time?

13:19.465 --> 13:21.558
Frannie, come here.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.102
There's someone
l want you to meet.

13:24.170 --> 13:27.435
Katie O'Clare, this is my wife,

13:27.506 --> 13:28.438
Francis.

13:28.507 --> 13:29.872
Pleased to meet you.

13:29.942 --> 13:32.069
l hope Michael hasn't been
bending your ear

13:32.144 --> 13:34.544
- all night long.
- My ear, my elbow...

13:34.613 --> 13:36.581
We were arm wrestling.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.583
Mmm, such a gentleman.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.551
Well, thank you very much

13:40.619 --> 13:41.813
for your hospitality,

13:41.887 --> 13:43.821
and now l really
must be leaving.

13:43.889 --> 13:47.325
And, uh, drop in again
before you leave town.

13:47.393 --> 13:49.327
l will!

13:53.732 --> 13:55.723
lf you experience
any dizziness,

13:55.835 --> 13:57.769
report to Sick Bay immediately.

13:57.837 --> 13:58.804
Thank you.

13:59.872 --> 14:01.271
Good morning, gentlemen.

14:01.373 --> 14:03.864
l believe it's
afternoon- - oversleep?

14:03.976 --> 14:05.876
- Holodeck.
- Fair Haven?

14:05.978 --> 14:07.240
Welcome, weary traveler.

14:07.313 --> 14:08.405
Even l have to admit- -

14:08.480 --> 14:11.244
Mr. Paris' latest effort
is quite a tour de force.

14:11.317 --> 14:13.080
Ooh, high praise
from a hologram.

14:13.152 --> 14:15.245
Oh, l was thinking, Captain- -

14:15.321 --> 14:17.755
now that we've got
this open- door policy,

14:17.823 --> 14:21.759
maybe l could expand Fair Haven
into Holodeck 2.

14:21.827 --> 14:23.590
lt would give me some room
to create the seacoast.

14:23.662 --> 14:25.892
- By all means.
- Speaking of revisions,

14:25.998 --> 14:28.899
l was hoping l could give
my character a more active role.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.935
ln the period you've created,
the village priest was

14:32.037 --> 14:33.470
the most prominent member
of the community,

14:33.539 --> 14:35.097
held in the highest regard.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.641
You know, that's
a great idea, Doc.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.645
We could send Father Mulligan

14:40.713 --> 14:42.806
on a retreat
to a nearby monastery,

14:42.882 --> 14:45.316
where he takes
a vow of silence

14:45.384 --> 14:47.352
and never speaks again.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.487
Try it!

14:50.556 --> 14:52.319
And you'll be saying
''Hail Marys''

14:52.391 --> 14:54.689
till St. Patrick's Day.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.162
Time?

14:59.231 --> 15:00.596
30 seconds.

15:00.699 --> 15:03.429
Let's see it.

15:09.475 --> 15:10.874
All hands, this is

15:11.043 --> 15:11.873
the Captain.

15:11.977 --> 15:15.936
Secure your stations
and brace for impact.

15:25.891 --> 15:27.586
We've cleared the leading edge.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.355
Turbulence is decreasing.

15:29.428 --> 15:30.759
Shields are holding.

15:30.829 --> 15:32.524
- Damage?
- We've got

15:32.598 --> 15:34.589
a ruptured plasma conduit,
Deck 9.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.635
Send a repair team.

15:36.702 --> 15:39.899
Maintain Yellow Alert.

15:40.039 --> 15:43.566
Let's hope that was
the worst of it.

15:43.676 --> 15:45.803
Captain's Personal Log.

15:45.878 --> 15:48.312
lt's been ten hours
since the storm hit.

15:48.380 --> 15:51.645
We estimate another three days
before we're clear of it.

15:51.717 --> 15:54.481
The crew's in good spirits,
and many of them

15:54.553 --> 15:57.488
have taken the opportunity
to visit Fair Haven.

15:57.556 --> 16:00.923
l met an interesting man there,
and for a while,

16:00.993 --> 16:03.359
l almost forgot
he was a hologram.

16:03.429 --> 16:05.693
We weren't exactly compatible.

16:05.764 --> 16:08.528
Then again, Mr. Paris
didn't program him

16:08.600 --> 16:11.228
to my specifications.

16:22.147 --> 16:29.280
Computer, display Fair Haven
character Michael Sullivan.

16:31.890 --> 16:37.886
Adjust his parameters to the
following specifications...

16:37.997 --> 16:42.263
Give him the education
of a 19th century...

16:42.368 --> 16:46.304
third- year student
at Trinity College.

16:47.873 --> 16:50.433
Modification complete.

16:50.542 --> 16:55.673
Now... access the character's
interactive subroutines.

16:57.049 --> 16:59.313
Make him more provocative.

16:59.385 --> 17:01.319
Specify.

17:01.420 --> 17:04.856
Give him a more
complicated personality.

17:04.923 --> 17:06.550
Specify.

17:09.762 --> 17:11.627
More outspoken...

17:11.696 --> 17:14.825
more confident,
not so reserved...

17:15.000 --> 17:18.492
and make him more curious
about the world around him.

17:18.604 --> 17:21.095
Modification complete.

17:21.205 --> 17:26.371
Good. Now...

17:26.444 --> 17:30.541
increase the character's
height by...

17:30.616 --> 17:32.345
three centimeters.

17:35.954 --> 17:37.819
Remove the facial hair.

17:39.691 --> 17:40.623
No...

17:40.692 --> 17:41.716
no, l don't like that.

17:41.794 --> 17:44.763
Put some back- - 
about two days' growth.

17:45.831 --> 17:46.889
Better.

17:46.999 --> 17:49.399
Oh, one more thing.

17:49.501 --> 17:52.937
Access his interpersonal
subroutines...

17:53.005 --> 17:55.940
familial characters.

17:56.008 --> 17:59.273
Delete the wife.

17:59.344 --> 18:02.177
Modification complete.

18:06.051 --> 18:09.578
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Sullivan.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.161
Are you ill, Commander?

18:27.606 --> 18:31.872
l am experiencing
a slight loss of equilibrium

18:31.944 --> 18:35.243
and some gastrointestinal
distress.

18:35.314 --> 18:36.804
Space sickness?

18:36.882 --> 18:40.045
Unlikely. l'm not prone
to that condition.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.882
Perhaps you should
go to Sick Bay.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.387
l'll be fine.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.719
l'm telling you,
we should add more fog.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.383
Fog is depressing.

18:47.459 --> 18:48.391
lt's authentic!

18:48.460 --> 18:49.722
lt's dangerous!

18:49.795 --> 18:51.387
All right, we could add
a lighthouse.

18:51.463 --> 18:54.364
lt's Fair Haven, Harry.
Sunshine.

18:54.433 --> 18:55.365
Tuvok,

18:55.434 --> 18:57.265
what do you think:
lrish seacoast- -

18:57.369 --> 18:58.768
fog or no fog?

18:58.837 --> 19:00.202
l have no opinion.

19:00.272 --> 19:02.706
He hasn't visited our
little paradise yet.

19:02.774 --> 19:03.706
Nor do l

19:03.775 --> 19:04.707
intend to.

19:04.776 --> 19:06.403
l think you'd like
it, Commander.

19:06.478 --> 19:07.410
lt's a great place
to meditate.

19:07.479 --> 19:09.470
lmagine yourself sitting

19:09.548 --> 19:11.812
high on a bluff
overlooking the ocean.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.476
Salt air...

19:13.552 --> 19:16.385
the rhythm of the waves
rising and crashing

19:16.455 --> 19:17.649
against the rocks...

19:17.723 --> 19:18.985
a tiny fishing boat

19:19.057 --> 19:20.490
bobbing on the water below...

19:20.559 --> 19:21.651
up and down,

19:21.727 --> 19:23.194
up and down.

19:24.263 --> 19:27.391
l get the idea, Ensign.
Thank you.

19:27.466 --> 19:30.162
Mutton, creamed cabbage
or blood pudding?

19:30.269 --> 19:31.600
Explain.

19:31.703 --> 19:33.330
l'm preparing
a traditional lrish meal

19:33.438 --> 19:34.666
at The Ox and Lamb
this afternoon,

19:34.773 --> 19:37.333
and l cannot decide
on a main course.

19:37.442 --> 19:39.376
Blood pudding- - 
you can't lose.

19:39.444 --> 19:40.775
Well, that was

19:40.846 --> 19:41.778
my first choice, too,

19:41.847 --> 19:43.280
but replicating
the lamb's intestines- -

19:43.348 --> 19:45.839
it- it could be tricky,
and every time

19:45.918 --> 19:48.386
l try to heat the blood,
it coagulates

19:48.453 --> 19:49.385
in the milk.

19:49.454 --> 19:50.546
lf you'll excuse me.

19:50.622 --> 19:53.989
l think l will consult
the Doctor.

20:17.849 --> 20:18.781
Excuse me, ma'am.

20:18.850 --> 20:19.782
Hmm?

20:19.851 --> 20:21.284
Have you seen
Michael Sullivan?

20:21.353 --> 20:22.445
Oh, you might try the pub.

20:22.521 --> 20:23.613
l just came from there.

20:23.689 --> 20:26.453
Oh, then he'll be
at the train station.

20:26.525 --> 20:27.457
Yeah.

20:27.526 --> 20:28.515
Thank you.

20:28.594 --> 20:29.561
Sure.

20:41.573 --> 20:43.006
Excuse me, sir.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.543
ls the train to Galway
running on time?

20:45.611 --> 20:48.842
Um... l'm afraid
you've just missed it.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.382
Have a seat.
Wait for the next one.

20:56.588 --> 20:59.455
Do you know Jane Eldon?

20:59.524 --> 21:02.652
Eldon. No, l've never met her.

21:02.761 --> 21:04.422
Well, l'd be terrified
if you had.

21:04.463 --> 21:05.828
She's been dead 70 years.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.267
No, l was, uh...

21:10.335 --> 21:12.565
l was thinking
about her poetry.

21:12.671 --> 21:14.605
lt's too pastoral
for my taste.

21:14.673 --> 21:16.106
Don't you agree?

21:16.174 --> 21:18.870
l'm not familiar
with her work.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.434
Really?

21:20.512 --> 21:23.037
Well, what about Sean Gogarty?

21:23.115 --> 21:25.811
They have similar
rhyming schemes.

21:29.187 --> 21:31.155
You've some
catching up to do.

21:32.691 --> 21:34.625
Well, l'm here
every afternoon.

21:34.693 --> 21:36.752
You should join me sometime.

21:36.828 --> 21:38.796
l tried talking
poetry with Seamus,

21:38.864 --> 21:41.458
but all he can do
is recite limericks.

21:41.533 --> 21:42.465
l'd love to.

21:42.567 --> 21:44.728
Strange place to read, though.

21:44.836 --> 21:46.167
Not at all.

21:46.238 --> 21:48.672
l love the sound of the
trains coming and going.

21:48.740 --> 21:50.298
Gets me thinking
about places

21:50.409 --> 21:52.673
l'd like to visit.

21:52.744 --> 21:55.338
Have you traveled
much yourself?

21:55.414 --> 21:57.678
As a matter of fact...

21:57.749 --> 21:59.842
But there's one place
l haven't been yet- -

21:59.918 --> 22:00.942
Castle O'Dell.

22:01.053 --> 22:03.578
lt's a steep climb,

22:03.622 --> 22:05.214
but from the top
of the battlement,

22:05.290 --> 22:07.224
you can see all
the way to Dublin.

22:07.292 --> 22:09.021
We'd better be moving.

22:16.468 --> 22:18.231
They say when the sun
goes down,

22:18.337 --> 22:20.771
the King of the Faeries
reclaims the castle.

22:20.839 --> 22:22.773
Maybe he'll invite
us to supper.

22:22.841 --> 22:25.435
Eh, you'll be dining alone,
without me.

22:25.510 --> 22:27.603
One taste
of the faeries' banquet,

22:27.679 --> 22:29.271
and you'll never return
to this world.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.612
Oh, don't tell me you
believe those stories.

22:31.683 --> 22:36.279
Believe? No.
But l do respect them.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.118
Can l ask you something,
Katie?

22:38.190 --> 22:39.623
Please.

22:39.691 --> 22:42.785
Have you a man
waiting for you at home?

22:42.861 --> 22:44.123
No.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.823
Are you looking for one?

22:46.865 --> 22:48.628
Why, do you have somebody?

22:48.700 --> 22:49.962
ln Fair Haven?

22:50.068 --> 22:52.502
Not unless you fancy
a pig farmer.

22:52.571 --> 22:55.131
Oh, not my type.

22:55.240 --> 22:57.208
Well, what about a barkeep

22:57.309 --> 23:01.336
who reads poetry
in strange places?

23:01.413 --> 23:02.573
Captain?

23:04.249 --> 23:05.807
l thought that was you.

23:05.884 --> 23:07.875
Just getting in the spirit.

23:07.986 --> 23:09.715
l can see that.

23:09.788 --> 23:11.517
l don't believe we've met.

23:11.590 --> 23:14.115
Sullivan.
Michael Sullivan.

23:14.192 --> 23:15.124
Chakotay.

23:15.193 --> 23:16.592
That's a fine tattoo.

23:16.661 --> 23:17.889
Are you off a ship?

23:18.029 --> 23:19.894
You could say that.

23:20.966 --> 23:22.729
We're on the way up
to the old castle.

23:22.801 --> 23:24.894
You're welcome
to come with us.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.935
Thanks, but, um...

23:27.005 --> 23:29.565
l'm meeting Neelix
at The Ox and Lamb.

23:29.674 --> 23:31.869
You two have fun.

23:34.179 --> 23:38.775
ls it my imagination,
or did he call you Captain?

23:38.850 --> 23:40.977
Did he?

23:45.891 --> 23:47.825
Looks like the worst
is yet to come.

23:47.893 --> 23:49.326
Commander?

23:49.394 --> 23:50.759
l just came
from Astrometrics.

23:50.829 --> 23:53.263
Seven's found an increase
in the neutronic gradient

23:53.331 --> 23:55.094
at the trailing edge
of the wavefront.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.191
lt's going to be
a rough ride when it hits.

23:57.302 --> 23:58.667
We've still got two days.

23:58.737 --> 24:01.035
Start working on a
new shield modulation.

24:01.139 --> 24:02.697
Yes, ma'am.

24:02.774 --> 24:04.742
That could explain
my recent space sickness.

24:04.843 --> 24:06.708
Vulcan physiology
is highly sensitive

24:06.778 --> 24:07.836
to neutronic gradients.

24:07.913 --> 24:09.881
You'd make a good barometer,
Tuvok.

24:09.948 --> 24:12.644
Every time you get queasy,
we go to Red Alert.

24:15.954 --> 24:17.581
Thanks for your report,
Commander.

24:17.656 --> 24:19.385
Don't mention it.

24:19.458 --> 24:22.393
Hills Most Green,
Hearts Unseen.

24:22.461 --> 24:23.553
Yes. Jane Eldon.

24:23.628 --> 24:25.027
Catching up
on a little reading.

24:25.096 --> 24:26.028
Those hills and hearts

24:26.097 --> 24:27.860
wouldn't happen to be
in lreland?

24:27.933 --> 24:30.424
You can wipe that smirk
off your face.

24:30.502 --> 24:31.662
lt's not what you think.

24:31.770 --> 24:35.399
l wasn't thinking anything,
but now that you mention it...

24:35.507 --> 24:39.273
l have an interest
in lrish culture.

24:39.344 --> 24:40.675
lt's understandable.

24:40.745 --> 24:43.236
They've produced great writers
for hundreds of years...

24:43.315 --> 24:45.408
not to mention great bartenders.

24:47.619 --> 24:49.416
He's a hologram.

24:49.488 --> 24:52.753
l couldn't help but notice- - 
he seemed a little taller

24:52.824 --> 24:53.950
than the last
time l saw him.

24:54.025 --> 24:55.390
Yes, l made
a few modifications.

24:55.460 --> 24:56.392
ln the interest

24:56.461 --> 24:57.450
of lrish culture?

24:57.529 --> 24:58.621
Exactly.

25:01.066 --> 25:03.398
You seemed embarrassed
when l ran into you.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.163
There was no reason to be.

25:05.270 --> 25:08.706
lt was nice to see you
having a little fun.

25:12.944 --> 25:15.208
He is rather charming,
isn't he?

25:15.280 --> 25:18.443
Too bad he's made
of photons and force fields.

25:18.517 --> 25:21.577
l never let that
stand in my way.

25:30.462 --> 25:32.054
The boys are getting tired.

25:32.130 --> 25:33.859
Them or you?

25:33.932 --> 25:36.264
Faster, boys!

26:14.773 --> 26:16.502
Computer...

26:16.575 --> 26:19.772
remove all characters
except for Michael Sullivan.

26:27.185 --> 26:29.619
Can l ask you something, Katie?

26:29.688 --> 26:31.349
Please.

26:31.423 --> 26:33.687
Would you mind if l kissed you?

26:34.826 --> 26:37.090
l might even kiss you back.

26:39.464 --> 26:42.160
There's no point in
waiting any longer,

26:42.267 --> 26:43.529
is there?

26:43.635 --> 26:46.103
Oh, l think
l've waited long enough.

27:00.051 --> 27:02.144
ls there something wrong?

27:06.558 --> 27:09.186
No.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.264
Computer, recycle.

27:56.007 --> 27:56.974
Come in.

28:00.011 --> 28:01.706
l thought you'd like to know

28:01.746 --> 28:04.340
we've organized a rings
tournament tonight

28:04.382 --> 28:05.314
at Sullivan's.

28:05.383 --> 28:07.817
Thanks, Neelix,
but l have work to do.

28:10.689 --> 28:14.147
The Doctor's going to sing
something called ''Danny Boy'',

28:14.225 --> 28:17.717
and Mossie Donegan's promised
to bring his talking pig.

28:17.796 --> 28:18.922
Well, let's just say

28:18.997 --> 28:21.192
l'd rather stick to
reality right now.

28:22.901 --> 28:25.529
1900 hours...
if you change your mind.

28:25.637 --> 28:27.195
Thank you.

28:33.344 --> 28:34.868
Saints preserve us.

28:35.013 --> 28:38.449
l possess superior
hand/eye coordination.

28:38.516 --> 28:41.076
That's not all
that's superior.

28:41.152 --> 28:43.882
The lily and the rose
are staging

28:43.955 --> 28:46.185
a competition on your face.

28:46.257 --> 28:47.588
Clarify.

28:47.659 --> 28:49.183
The fullness of your lips

28:49.260 --> 28:51.353
and the paleness
of your cheeks- -

28:51.429 --> 28:53.454
it's enough to make a man faint.

28:53.531 --> 28:57.058
Then, in that case,
perhaps we should sit down.

29:02.107 --> 29:03.404
l don't believe it.

29:03.475 --> 29:06.444
lt's called
''old- world charm,'' Harry.

29:06.544 --> 29:07.909
What'll it be, gentlemen?

29:08.980 --> 29:10.140
Nothing for me.

29:10.215 --> 29:11.978
''Temperance is a virtue.''

29:12.050 --> 29:13.347
Where's Michael?

29:13.418 --> 29:14.544
Over there.

29:18.623 --> 29:19.817
That's strange.

29:19.958 --> 29:22.290
l programmed him
not to drink.

29:22.360 --> 29:25.329
Must be a glitch
in his subroutine.

29:30.401 --> 29:32.631
Are these seats taken?

29:32.737 --> 29:34.864
Sit anywhere you like.

29:40.612 --> 29:44.844
Vile.

29:44.916 --> 29:48.079
lt's been 15 years
since l touched the stuff.

29:48.153 --> 29:50.087
You making up for lost time?

29:50.155 --> 29:52.589
l was hoping
it might ease the pain.

29:52.657 --> 29:53.851
Are you in discomfort?

29:53.925 --> 29:56.587
Agony's more like it.

29:57.962 --> 30:01.921
How could you do this to me,
Lord?

30:03.334 --> 30:05.131
Why don't you ask him?

30:05.236 --> 30:06.863
You've got his ear, don't you?

30:06.971 --> 30:08.370
Well...

30:09.440 --> 30:11.101
Three days...

30:11.176 --> 30:14.270
the happiest three days
of my life.

30:14.345 --> 30:18.304
l was a fool to think
she felt the same.

30:19.951 --> 30:20.883
l was such a fool!

30:20.952 --> 30:22.419
Aw, sit down, Sullivan.

30:22.487 --> 30:24.421
Shut your mouth, man,
or l'll shut it for you.

30:24.489 --> 30:25.421
Oh, you will, will you?

30:25.490 --> 30:26.422
Hey, hey, hey...

30:26.491 --> 30:28.186
take it easy.

30:30.995 --> 30:35.091
Um... why don't you tell us
what happened?

30:36.734 --> 30:39.635
We...

30:39.704 --> 30:43.640
we spent a perfect day
together by the lake.

30:43.708 --> 30:45.676
l drifted off to sleep,

30:45.743 --> 30:49.543
and... when l woke up,
she was gone.

30:52.083 --> 30:53.448
Where is she, Tom?

30:53.518 --> 30:55.008
Who?

30:55.153 --> 30:56.620
Katie O'Clare- - who else?

30:58.022 --> 30:59.614
Katie O'Clare?

30:59.691 --> 31:01.158
Your friend.

31:03.928 --> 31:05.691
Um...

31:05.763 --> 31:07.424
are you sure you didn't...

31:07.498 --> 31:10.661
uh... misinterpret
her interests?

31:10.768 --> 31:12.030
l mean, we're all friends here.

31:12.136 --> 31:14.161
Maybe she was just
being friendly.

31:14.272 --> 31:15.569
You calling me a liar?

31:15.640 --> 31:17.540
N- no, no, not at all.

31:17.609 --> 31:21.875
l thought...
Katie and me were in love.

31:21.946 --> 31:24.779
l may have to do
some reprogramming...

31:24.849 --> 31:25.907
What's the matter?

31:25.984 --> 31:27.315
You don't think
l'm good enough for her?

31:27.385 --> 31:28.909
No, l- l didn't say that.

31:28.987 --> 31:30.750
Well, tell me
where she's gone.

31:30.822 --> 31:31.720
l don't know.

31:31.789 --> 31:33.017
Well, l think you do!

31:36.294 --> 31:37.420
Gentlemen, please!

31:37.495 --> 31:39.463
''Love thy neighbor.''

31:43.101 --> 31:44.363
Let's see... l remember

31:44.469 --> 31:46.699
trying to reach the
holodeck controls.

31:46.804 --> 31:48.795
Then, uh, somebody
grabbed my leg.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.875
Maybe it was the talking pig.

31:50.975 --> 31:55.241
lf it was, he had
one hell of a left hook.

31:55.313 --> 31:56.905
What's all this?

31:56.981 --> 32:00.007
l'm afraid there's
been some trouble in paradise- -

32:00.051 --> 32:02.076
an altercation in the pub
this afternoon.

32:02.120 --> 32:03.553
Several crewmen were injured.

32:03.621 --> 32:04.883
Nothing serious.

32:04.956 --> 32:07.390
Arm wrestling get
out of hand, boys?

32:07.458 --> 32:08.720
Not exactly.

32:08.793 --> 32:09.885
lt was Michael Sullivan,
Captain.

32:09.961 --> 32:12.259
He was...

32:12.330 --> 32:14.594
...looking for someone.

32:14.666 --> 32:19.433
Why don't we...
take a little walk?

32:23.274 --> 32:26.732
Let me guess- - 
that someone is me.

32:26.844 --> 32:28.937
l don't mean to pry, Captain,

32:29.013 --> 32:30.776
but we've got a
broken- hearted hologram

32:30.848 --> 32:32.782
who believed that the
two of you were in love.

32:32.850 --> 32:35.444
Oh, l was sure he'd be
on to the next lass by now.

32:35.520 --> 32:36.953
l hope he's all right.

32:37.021 --> 32:38.613
Far from it.

32:38.690 --> 32:41.124
The fight spilled
out onto the street.

32:41.192 --> 32:42.625
Before long, he'd
climbed up a tree

32:42.694 --> 32:44.628
and began shouting your name.

32:44.696 --> 32:47.631
Mr. Neelix managed
to... talk him down.

32:47.699 --> 32:50.668
lt could be a malfunction
in his behavioral subroutines.

32:50.735 --> 32:51.667
l've already checked that.

32:51.736 --> 32:52.964
His subroutines are fine...

32:53.071 --> 32:54.800
but l did notice you've made

32:54.906 --> 32:56.965
quite a number of alterations
to his program.

32:57.075 --> 32:58.007
Minor improvements.

32:58.076 --> 32:59.509
To make him more appealing?

32:59.577 --> 33:01.374
You're starting to pry, Doctor.

33:01.479 --> 33:04.073
l apologize for
overstepping my bounds,

33:04.115 --> 33:06.049
but l'm worried about you.

33:06.117 --> 33:07.880
Michael Sullivan
is a hologram.

33:07.952 --> 33:09.214
His broken heart can be mended

33:09.287 --> 33:10.219
with the flick of a switch.

33:10.288 --> 33:11.721
Your feelings, however,

33:11.789 --> 33:15.384
are a little more...
complicated.

33:15.460 --> 33:17.052
l'm not going to be
climbing any trees,

33:17.128 --> 33:19.562
if that's what you're
worried about.

33:19.630 --> 33:21.723
lf you decide
you want to talk,

33:21.799 --> 33:25.394
l've been hearing a lot
of confessions lately.

33:25.503 --> 33:27.733
Let me know.

33:27.839 --> 33:31.468
You want a confession,
Doctor?

33:33.511 --> 33:36.378
All right.

33:38.683 --> 33:40.446
l've become
romantically involved

33:40.518 --> 33:42.611
with a hologram,
if that's possible.

33:42.687 --> 33:43.779
Tell me what happened.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.789
Oh, you know the story- - 
girl meets boy;

33:45.857 --> 33:47.449
girl modifies
boy's subroutines.

33:47.525 --> 33:49.117
Did you have
intimate relations?

33:49.193 --> 33:50.285
That's none
of your business.

33:50.361 --> 33:53.125
Let's just say it was
a memorable three days.

33:53.197 --> 33:54.459
l don't see the problem.

33:54.532 --> 33:55.624
Don't you?

33:55.700 --> 33:57.793
Michael Sullivan
is exactly my type- -

33:57.902 --> 33:59.460
attractive, intelligent.

33:59.570 --> 34:00.935
We share
the same interests,

34:01.039 --> 34:02.700
and if there's something
l don't like,

34:02.774 --> 34:04.537
l can simply change it.

34:04.609 --> 34:06.201
l've noticed that
humans usually try

34:06.277 --> 34:08.040
to change the people
they fall in love with.

34:08.112 --> 34:09.043
What's the difference?

34:09.112 --> 34:12.172
ln this case, it works.

34:15.152 --> 34:17.553
We had a picnic by the lake
yesterday afternoon.

34:17.621 --> 34:18.884
Michael drifted off
to sleep.

34:18.956 --> 34:20.719
His head was lying
on my shoulder,

34:20.792 --> 34:23.886
and l remember thinking,
''This is close to perfect.''

34:23.960 --> 34:25.724
Then he began to snore.

34:25.797 --> 34:27.788
Did l nudge him with my elbow,

34:27.864 --> 34:29.389
hoping he'd roll over
and stop?

34:29.467 --> 34:31.731
Did l whisper in his ear
to wake him? No.

34:31.835 --> 34:34.565
Why bother, when l could
simply access the computer

34:34.672 --> 34:35.866
and alter
his vocal algorithms?

34:35.973 --> 34:38.407
And that's exactly
what l was about to do,

34:38.476 --> 34:40.103
when l realized
that everything around me

34:40.178 --> 34:43.443
was an illusion,
including him, so l left.

34:43.514 --> 34:45.447
Oh, l almost wrote him a note
to say good- bye.

34:45.516 --> 34:46.447
Could you believe that- -

34:46.516 --> 34:49.281
a ''Dear John'' letter
to a hologram?

34:52.356 --> 34:55.449
l understand your
trepidation...

34:55.525 --> 34:57.460
but you're the Captain.

34:57.528 --> 34:58.790
You can't have a relationship

34:58.863 --> 34:59.955
with a member of your crew.

35:00.031 --> 35:01.726
They're all your subordinates.

35:01.766 --> 35:03.028
So where does that leave you- -

35:03.101 --> 35:06.161
the occasional dalliance
with a passing alien?

35:06.270 --> 35:08.033
Voyager could be in
the Delta Quadrant

35:08.106 --> 35:09.869
for a very long time.

35:09.941 --> 35:12.034
A hologram may be
the only logical alternative.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.543
He's not real.

35:13.611 --> 35:15.044
He's as real as l am.

35:15.113 --> 35:17.240
Photons and force fields;
flesh and blood- -

35:17.315 --> 35:18.247
it's all the same,

35:18.316 --> 35:20.250
as long as your
feelings are real.

35:20.318 --> 35:21.876
He makes a joke; you laugh.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.284
ls that an illusion?

35:23.354 --> 35:24.878
He says something
that makes you think.

35:24.956 --> 35:28.050
Does it matter how his
molecules are aligned?

35:28.126 --> 35:29.559
Did it ever occur to you

35:29.627 --> 35:30.719
that it's not
just a question

35:30.795 --> 35:32.592
of whether or
not he's real?

35:32.663 --> 35:34.255
What do you mean?

35:34.332 --> 35:36.061
l think you should
stop trying to control

35:36.167 --> 35:38.397
every aspect of
this relationship.

35:38.503 --> 35:40.937
Romance is born
out of differences

35:41.005 --> 35:42.939
as well as similarities...

35:43.007 --> 35:46.374
out of the unexpected
as well as the familiar.

35:47.678 --> 35:50.442
Maybe l just needed
to be sure...

35:50.515 --> 35:53.109
he'd love me back.

35:53.184 --> 35:55.448
But isn't that the
risk you always take,

35:55.520 --> 35:57.954
hologram or not?

35:58.022 --> 35:59.956
All l know is...

36:00.024 --> 36:02.720
Michael Sullivan was
up in that tree,

36:02.760 --> 36:05.194
shouting your name.

36:05.229 --> 36:08.824
l've never been afraid
of taking risks.

36:08.900 --> 36:11.164
Then perhaps next time,

36:11.269 --> 36:15.569
you should just...
let him snore.

36:33.324 --> 36:34.985
The neutronic gradient's
rising- -

36:35.059 --> 36:36.287
30 million terajoules...

36:36.360 --> 36:37.452
40 million.

36:37.528 --> 36:38.460
Shields.

36:38.529 --> 36:39.791
Holding.

36:39.864 --> 36:40.831
60 million.

36:42.066 --> 36:43.124
Torres to Bridge.

36:43.234 --> 36:45.259
The inverse warp field's
destabilizing.

36:45.369 --> 36:46.631
We're losing our anchor.

36:46.737 --> 36:48.568
Acknowledged. How long
before we're clear?

36:48.639 --> 36:49.663
At least
another five minutes.

36:49.774 --> 36:50.832
That's about four

36:50.942 --> 36:51.874
minutes too long.

36:51.943 --> 36:54.036
The gradient's rising fast- - 
90 million.

36:55.479 --> 36:57.606
Stabilizers are off- line.

37:01.619 --> 37:03.416
Thrusters.

37:03.487 --> 37:04.579
No effect.

37:04.655 --> 37:06.054
Shields are failing.

37:06.123 --> 37:07.556
How close are we
to the perimeter?

37:07.625 --> 37:08.717
A thousand kilometers,

37:08.793 --> 37:10.761
but we're being pulled along
with the storm.

37:10.828 --> 37:11.760
What have you got in mind?

37:11.829 --> 37:13.126
The deflector beam- - 
we might be able

37:13.197 --> 37:14.494
to cut a path
through the wavefront.

37:14.565 --> 37:16.465
lt's possible,
but we'd have to route

37:16.567 --> 37:18.330
all available power
to the emitters.

37:18.436 --> 37:20.870
That won't be enough.
Primary systems are down.

37:20.938 --> 37:22.963
Then transfer all
secondary power sources- -

37:23.074 --> 37:25.872
transporters,
replicators, holodecks.

37:26.010 --> 37:27.477
Captain, there's not enough time

37:27.578 --> 37:29.512
to go through the hologrid
shutdown sequence.

37:29.580 --> 37:30.808
We'd lose most of Fair Haven.

37:33.284 --> 37:34.717
Do it.

37:36.120 --> 37:38.179
Hull fractures, Decks 6 and 7.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.156
You've got
all the secondary power, Tuvok.

37:40.224 --> 37:41.156
ls that enough?

37:41.225 --> 37:42.556
Negative.

37:42.627 --> 37:44.185
Siphon energy
from the plasma network- -

37:44.262 --> 37:46.127
every last deciwatt!

37:46.897 --> 37:48.728
Deflector beam active.

37:53.838 --> 37:55.533
We're approaching the perimeter.

37:55.640 --> 37:57.198
500 kilometers...

37:57.308 --> 37:58.775
400...

37:59.844 --> 38:01.505
Deflector output is dropping.

38:01.612 --> 38:02.806
Give him everything we've got- -

38:02.847 --> 38:04.439
life support,
environmental control.

38:04.515 --> 38:07.109
Scrape the residual ions off the
sonic showers if you have to.

38:34.245 --> 38:36.008
Doesn't look good, Tom.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.342
With this much photonic decay,

38:37.415 --> 38:40.350
we'll be able to save five,
maybe ten percent.

38:40.418 --> 38:42.682
So much for the
luck of the lrish.

38:42.753 --> 38:44.880
lt might be easier
to start from scratch.

38:44.989 --> 38:46.217
lt wouldn't be the same.

38:46.290 --> 38:47.848
lt's like trying
to rewrite a novel

38:47.925 --> 38:50.792
after the only copy
of the data file's been deleted.

38:50.861 --> 38:52.453
All the details, the nuances- -

38:52.530 --> 38:53.690
they're all gone.

38:53.764 --> 38:55.356
Morning, lads.

38:55.433 --> 38:56.525
Hey, Seamus.

38:56.634 --> 38:58.261
Looks like a storm brewing.

38:58.369 --> 38:59.393
A storm?

38:59.503 --> 39:00.470
Heading in from the west.

39:00.571 --> 39:02.198
Could be a big one.

39:02.306 --> 39:04.001
Oh... you're right.

39:04.075 --> 39:05.406
l don't suppose

39:05.476 --> 39:07.034
you could spare
a shilling or two?

39:07.111 --> 39:08.601
Me wife and l made up
last night,

39:08.679 --> 39:10.510
and l wanted
to buy her a new parasol.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.942
The grid's destabilizing.

39:14.018 --> 39:15.315
We'd better get started

39:15.386 --> 39:16.853
on those repairs.

39:18.289 --> 39:20.416
So, what do we try and save?

39:20.491 --> 39:22.721
The Ox and Lamb? The church?

39:22.793 --> 39:24.488
Maggie O'Halloran?

39:24.562 --> 39:26.496
There's someone
l should talk to

39:26.564 --> 39:28.589
before we decide.

39:29.967 --> 39:30.899
Come in.

39:34.839 --> 39:37.330
Fair Haven didn't fare
too well.

39:37.441 --> 39:39.807
l'll break the news to the crew.

39:39.877 --> 39:41.310
With your permission,

39:41.379 --> 39:43.677
l'd like to try
to reconstruct the program.

39:43.748 --> 39:45.375
How long will it take?

39:45.449 --> 39:47.144
Six or seven weeks.

39:47.218 --> 39:48.515
Harry tells me

39:48.586 --> 39:49.712
that we should be able
to save

39:49.787 --> 39:52.722
about ten percent
of the existing elements.

39:52.790 --> 39:55.554
l thought you might have
a suggestion or two.

40:14.745 --> 40:16.940
Computer,
is Fair Haven character

40:17.014 --> 40:19.608
Michael Sullivan still intact?

40:19.683 --> 40:21.651
Affirmative.

40:24.855 --> 40:26.823
Activate him.

40:28.192 --> 40:29.955
Hello.

40:30.027 --> 40:32.791
You disappeared on me, Katie.

40:32.863 --> 40:35.457
l woke up, and you had gone.

40:35.533 --> 40:37.626
l had some thinking to do.

40:37.735 --> 40:39.293
Are you done?

40:39.403 --> 40:42.998
Yes.

40:45.709 --> 40:47.643
l'm leaving Fair Haven.

40:47.711 --> 40:49.508
Why?

40:49.580 --> 40:51.775
Because.

40:51.849 --> 40:54.511
That's not a very good reason.

40:54.585 --> 40:57.850
The situation is complicated.

40:57.922 --> 40:59.981
Another man?

41:00.057 --> 41:01.456
No.

41:01.492 --> 41:04.484
Your friends...

41:04.528 --> 41:06.723
they don't approve of me?

41:06.797 --> 41:08.731
They think you're charming.

41:11.702 --> 41:14.637
Are you not ready
to settle down yet?

41:14.705 --> 41:18.436
l'm as ready as l'll ever be.

41:20.911 --> 41:23.038
You're not making any sense.

41:23.113 --> 41:26.674
No, l guess l'm not.

41:26.750 --> 41:29.344
Well, l have a feeling

41:29.420 --> 41:33.481
that, uh, you won't
be forgetting us that easily.

41:33.557 --> 41:36.890
Fair Haven has that effect
on people.

41:39.430 --> 41:43.298
But there's one thing
l want you to know.

41:43.367 --> 41:46.359
l love you, Katie.

41:49.907 --> 41:52.501
l might actually
be passing this way

41:52.576 --> 41:56.672
in, uh... six or seven weeks.

41:56.747 --> 41:59.682
Maybe l'll stop by the pub.

42:01.852 --> 42:03.911
See that you do.

42:16.700 --> 42:19.191
Oh, computer, end program.

42:28.245 --> 42:29.974
Wait.

42:32.850 --> 42:37.446
l want to make one more
modification to the character.

42:37.521 --> 42:39.386
Specify.

42:42.426 --> 42:47.193
Deny Kathryn Janeway
any future access

42:47.264 --> 42:49.824
to his behavioral subroutines.

42:51.068 --> 42:53.161
Modification complete.

42:55.573 --> 42:58.041
Save program.
