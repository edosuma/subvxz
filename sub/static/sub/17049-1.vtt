01:42.435 --> 01:44.596
-Come on. Come on, darling.

01:44.704 --> 01:47.332
Come on. Come, come, come,
come, come. Come on.

01:47.440 --> 01:48.998
Ahh.

01:50.643 --> 01:53.111
Ah, lovely.
Come on. Come on.

01:53.213 --> 01:56.182
- Bit further.. Come on. Come on.

02:31.017 --> 02:34.953
This is the story of my childhood.

02:35.054 --> 02:39.286
In August 1924, I was born
Janet Paterson Frame.

02:39.392 --> 02:41.292
My twin, who was never named...

02:41.394 --> 02:43.521
died two weeks later..

03:31.010 --> 03:32.910
"Sea... cliff.. "

03:33.012 --> 03:36.038
That's where all the loonies go.

03:36.149 --> 03:39.778
Go away from the window.
Go back to your seats, Myrtle and Bruddie.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.547
Go on.

04:56.062 --> 04:59.259
- Come on.
- Margaret.

04:59.365 --> 05:01.265
Come on,Jean.

05:01.367 --> 05:04.268
- Peter.

05:04.370 --> 05:06.600
- I'll be your friend.
- Please? Please?

05:06.706 --> 05:08.697
Betty.

05:08.808 --> 05:11.208
- Come on,Jean.
- Peter.

05:11.311 --> 05:14.474
- Come on,Jean.
- Olive.

05:39.138 --> 05:41.470
Billy Delaware.

05:41.574 --> 05:43.735
Yes, Miss Botting?

05:44.777 --> 05:46.176
What are you eating?

05:49.048 --> 05:51.346
Chewing gum, Miss Botting.

05:53.519 --> 05:55.077
Where did you get it?

06:00.893 --> 06:02.861
Dids McIvor

06:04.297 --> 06:07.528
Where did you get your chewing gum?

06:07.633 --> 06:10.397
From Jean Frame, Miss Botting.

06:10.503 --> 06:13.267
Jean Frame.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.341
Yes, Miss Botting?

06:15.441 --> 06:17.568
Where did you get the chewing gum?

06:17.677 --> 06:20.168
From Heath's, Miss Botting.

06:37.764 --> 06:40.460
Where did you get the money?

06:40.566 --> 06:42.261
Out!

06:43.436 --> 06:45.461
My father gave it to me.

06:45.571 --> 06:47.869
Where did you get the money?

06:47.974 --> 06:51.432
- Collect!
- My father - My father gave it to me.

06:52.712 --> 06:54.680
Come out here.

07:01.888 --> 07:03.856
Come up here.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.260
Now tell me...

07:09.362 --> 07:11.990
where you got the money.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.965
I want... the truth.

07:15.067 --> 07:17.558
Dad gave it to me.

07:17.670 --> 07:19.638
Face the blackboard.

07:25.845 --> 07:27.244
Now...

07:28.681 --> 07:31.343
you will stay there...

07:31.451 --> 07:33.351
until you tell me...

07:33.453 --> 07:35.580
the truth.

08:10.857 --> 08:13.485
Turn around, Jean Frame.

08:16.028 --> 08:18.997
Are you ready to tell me the truth?

08:22.368 --> 08:24.996
I stole it out of Dad's pocket.

08:27.306 --> 08:29.934
Go to the back of the class.

08:37.616 --> 08:39.585
She's a thief!

08:40.620 --> 08:43.953
Thief. She's a thief.

08:46.058 --> 08:48.026
You're a thief.

08:55.268 --> 08:56.735
Turn.

09:00.006 --> 09:01.473
Turn.

09:03.109 --> 09:06.078
No, June, you have to turn
the same way as us.

09:09.682 --> 09:11.149
Turn.

09:13.419 --> 09:14.886
And turn.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.952
And turn.

09:20.793 --> 09:22.260
And turn.

09:28.100 --> 09:31.866
He's having a convulsion!
He's having a convulsion, Curly!

09:31.971 --> 09:34.940
- Curly!

09:36.809 --> 09:38.709
Go and have a look!

09:42.515 --> 09:45.416
- What are you doing, woman?
- Putting him in the bath!

09:45.518 --> 09:47.418
- What?
- In the bath!

09:47.520 --> 09:51.115
What the hell for?

09:51.223 --> 09:53.623
Curly? Curly?

09:53.726 --> 09:55.626
- Put him in the bath!
- What?

09:55.728 --> 09:58.492
- Put him in the bath!
- I'm not putting him in the bath.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.158
The boy's just having a bad dream.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.167
- Here's a towel.
- Oh, come on, woman! Why?

10:03.269 --> 10:05.032
The book says so!

10:05.137 --> 10:06.934
Wake up, boy!

10:07.039 --> 10:09.837
- Wake up!

10:09.942 --> 10:12.206
You girls, back to bed!

10:12.311 --> 10:14.279
Wake up!

10:15.381 --> 10:17.281
That's it.

10:17.383 --> 10:19.351
Wake up Wake up!

11:06.766 --> 11:11.135
Georgie Porgie's queer in the head!
Georgie Porgie's queer in the head!

11:13.239 --> 11:15.469
Doesn't belong at this school anyway.

11:15.574 --> 11:19.010
- You belong in the loonybin.
-Loonybin! Loonybin!

11:40.633 --> 11:43.932
Back!
Class, quiet, please!

11:44.036 --> 11:48.063
I want those children
whose names Doctor calls -

11:48.174 --> 11:50.438
Tom McKechnie, are you listening?

11:50.543 --> 11:52.238
Yes, miss.

11:52.344 --> 11:54.835
When you hear your names called...

11:54.947 --> 11:57.848
I want you to fall out.

11:57.950 --> 11:59.918
Ivor Thomas.

12:02.822 --> 12:05.586
-Jimmy McGill.
- That's the one with the ears.

12:06.425 --> 12:07.892
Jean Frame.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.192
Nora Byrne.

12:15.835 --> 12:17.803
Terrible family.

12:19.138 --> 12:23.097
Now, the rest of you
may go in quietly.

12:27.813 --> 12:30.714
In your Lines! Quietly!

12:30.816 --> 12:32.784
Come on, folks, follow me.

12:35.955 --> 12:37.923
Follow me.

12:48.968 --> 12:50.868
Look.

12:50.970 --> 12:52.870
When did you last wash?

12:52.972 --> 12:55.099
- Yesterday.
- Really?

12:56.208 --> 12:59.109
- I did wash yesterday.
- And what did you wash?

12:59.211 --> 13:01.179
My hands.

13:02.548 --> 13:05.517
- Your ears are filthy.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.917
Say after me whatever you hear
down the tube in a big, loud voice.

13:12.191 --> 13:15.251
Twenty-nine. Seventeen.

13:15.361 --> 13:17.829
Sixteen. Five.

13:25.004 --> 13:27.097
I know how to cure warts.

13:35.915 --> 13:38.509
- My real name isn't Poppy.
- What is it?

13:38.617 --> 13:40.517
Marjorie.

13:40.619 --> 13:44.555
- Is your name your real name?
- My real name's Janet.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.285
Janet. That's pretty.

13:47.393 --> 13:50.123
But I get called Jean mostly.

13:50.229 --> 13:52.720
And Nini. And Topsy.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.959
Is that because of your hair?

13:55.067 --> 13:57.126
Yes.

13:57.236 --> 14:00.205
- Can I touch it?
- Yes.

14:02.474 --> 14:05.136
You can touch my legs if you like.

14:05.244 --> 14:07.678
What are they?

14:07.780 --> 14:11.841
They're from when my dad whops me
with his machine belt.

14:13.485 --> 14:15.612
They feel funny, don't they?

14:17.489 --> 14:21.823
Tell the class
we will now have a nail inspection.

14:21.927 --> 14:26.023
Class, we are now going to have
a nail inspection.

14:26.131 --> 14:28.099
Hands on desks.

14:32.938 --> 14:35.668
- Very good.
- Very good.

14:35.774 --> 14:37.674
Excellent.

14:37.776 --> 14:40.370
- Bad.
- Disgusting.

14:40.479 --> 14:43.710
Miss Frame, collect up
the naughty children.

14:43.816 --> 14:46.080
Certainly, Miss Evans.

14:46.185 --> 14:48.153
Very bad!

14:55.361 --> 14:57.659
Is that Sally Oates again?

14:57.763 --> 14:59.993
I'm afraid so, Miss Evans.

15:01.433 --> 15:03.663
Well! Wicked child.

15:03.769 --> 15:05.737
Fetch the strap.

15:09.108 --> 15:12.509
Bad, bad, very bad.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.388
This is my special book.

15:25.624 --> 15:27.751
You can borrow it if you like.

15:34.533 --> 15:38.094
"'The 12 Dancing Princesses.'

15:38.203 --> 15:41.832
"There was a king who had
12 beautiful daughters...

15:43.175 --> 15:46.235
"and when they went to bed...

15:46.345 --> 15:49.246
"the doors were shut
and locked up.

15:49.348 --> 15:53.876
"But every morning their shoes
were found to be quite worn through...

15:53.986 --> 15:58.480
"as if they had been danced in
all night.

15:58.590 --> 16:02.924
"And yet nobody could find out
how it happened...

16:03.028 --> 16:05.724
or where they had been. "

16:09.101 --> 16:12.502
Mum says they come from a stork.

16:12.604 --> 16:14.504
No. You have to fuck.

16:14.606 --> 16:16.506
What's "fuck"?

16:16.608 --> 16:21.375
When a man gets on top of a woman
and he puts his thing into her...

16:21.480 --> 16:25.746
and he puts a frenchie on his thing
to stop her having a baby.

16:27.019 --> 16:29.283
Pounds, shillings and pence!

16:29.388 --> 16:31.652
A man fell over the fence!

16:31.757 --> 16:34.555
He fell on a lady
and squashed out a baby!

16:34.660 --> 16:37.185
Pounds, shillings and pence!

16:37.296 --> 16:39.787
Pounds, shillings and pence!

16:39.965 --> 16:44.493
All right, tonight, for homework,
I want you to write a poem.

16:44.603 --> 16:46.503
Copy this down.

16:46.605 --> 16:50.905
When... the... sun...

16:51.844 --> 16:54.745
goes... down...

16:55.781 --> 16:57.681
Have you got that?

16:57.783 --> 17:01.981
and... the... night...

17:03.889 --> 17:05.857
draws...

17:07.159 --> 17:09.059
nigh.

17:09.161 --> 17:11.060
There. Thanks.

17:11.163 --> 17:13.563
- That's the first line of your poem.
- Look. Look.

17:13.665 --> 17:17.328
What's that? Oh, I've got chalk
all over me. So I have.

17:17.435 --> 17:20.405
- You got all that down? Good.

17:25.844 --> 17:29.211
- What's that?
- It's a poem I wrote for school.

17:30.416 --> 17:32.441
Read it to us.

17:33.452 --> 17:37.047
"When the sun goes down
and the night draws nigh...

17:37.156 --> 17:39.249
and the evening shadows
touch the sky -"

17:39.358 --> 17:43.351
It should be
"Evening shadows tint the sky."

17:43.462 --> 17:45.362
Why?

17:45.464 --> 17:48.365
There are always words
that go together in poetry...

17:48.467 --> 17:53.734
Like waves lap, stars shine or twinkle,
and wind roars.

17:53.839 --> 17:55.739
Rub out "touch"
and put in "tint."

17:55.841 --> 17:57.934
But I like "touch."

17:58.043 --> 18:01.706
It sounds wrong.
"Evening shadows tint the sky."

18:02.581 --> 18:05.482
Go on. Rub out "touch"
and put in "tint. "

18:05.584 --> 18:07.552
It sounds more poetic.

18:21.333 --> 18:24.234
- No.Johnny- Uh,Jean, come on. Come on.

18:24.336 --> 18:28.329
Come on,Jean. Up here.
In a big, loud voice. There we go.

18:28.440 --> 18:33.036
"When the sun goes down
and the night draws nigh...

18:33.145 --> 18:36.012
"and the evening shadows
touch the...

18:36.115 --> 18:38.015
"sky...

18:38.117 --> 18:42.315
- "when the birds fly homeward to their nest...

18:42.421 --> 18:44.946
"then we know it is time to...

18:45.057 --> 18:46.957
"rest.

18:47.059 --> 18:50.961
"When rabbits to their burrows run...

18:51.063 --> 18:54.260
"and children have finished their daily...

18:54.366 --> 18:56.266
"fun...

18:56.368 --> 19:00.532
"when the tiny stars come out to peep...

19:00.639 --> 19:03.164
"then we know it is time to...

19:03.275 --> 19:05.175
sleep."

19:05.277 --> 19:07.177
Thank you,Jean.

19:07.279 --> 19:09.179
- Well done. Well done.

19:09.281 --> 19:11.545
Now, anybody else
like to read their poems?

19:16.355 --> 19:19.290
- How's my little girl?
- What have you got?

19:19.391 --> 19:22.827
Uh-uh. What hand?

19:22.928 --> 19:24.896
This one.

19:27.866 --> 19:29.834
This one.

19:33.605 --> 19:35.505
Both.

19:35.607 --> 19:37.541
Both?

19:38.577 --> 19:40.545
There you are.

19:42.080 --> 19:45.140
That's to write
some more of your poems in.

20:29.995 --> 20:33.954
Myrtle and Ted did it
in the plannies this afternoon.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.034
Did what?

20:37.135 --> 20:39.126
Fucked.

20:43.675 --> 20:47.406
I forbid you to ever speak to Ted and Poppy
and any of that family ever again!

20:47.512 --> 20:49.878
Do you understand?

20:51.316 --> 20:53.375
And as for you, Myrtle -

20:53.485 --> 20:55.385
Mother, where's the strap?

20:55.487 --> 20:57.387
- Come here!
- No! Curly! Curly!

20:57.489 --> 20:59.957
- Curly!

21:01.927 --> 21:04.623
Bend over!

21:15.641 --> 21:19.702
I'm not allowed to speak to you
or play with you ever again.

21:19.811 --> 21:22.780
I 'm not allowed
to speak to you neither.

21:32.824 --> 21:34.792
Here's your special book.

22:00.585 --> 22:03.019
- Shh!

22:03.121 --> 22:05.521
Shh!

22:05.624 --> 22:08.218
Look out.
There's dynamite down there.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.852
- Thank you. Next, please.

22:15.701 --> 22:18.226
Look out!
There's dynamite down there!

22:18.337 --> 22:21.568
- Next, please.

22:21.673 --> 22:25.234
- Look, there's Avril Luxton!

22:25.344 --> 22:28.336
Thank you. Next.

22:31.416 --> 22:34.647
Look out!
There's dynamite down there!

22:41.827 --> 22:44.796
Look out!
There's dynamite down there!

22:44.896 --> 22:48.263
"I met at eve the Prince of Sleep.

22:48.367 --> 22:51.996
"His was a still and lovely face.

22:52.104 --> 22:55.505
"He wandered
through a valley steep...

22:55.607 --> 22:58.906
"lovely in a lonely place.

22:59.010 --> 23:01.376
"His garb was gray of lavender.

23:01.480 --> 23:04.176
"Above his brow, a poppy wreath...

23:04.282 --> 23:06.182
"burned like dim coals...

23:06.284 --> 23:09.913
"and everywhere
the air was sweeter for his breath.

23:10.021 --> 23:14.253
"His twilight feet no sandals wore.

23:14.359 --> 23:18.125
"His eyes shone faint
in their own flame.

23:18.230 --> 23:21.495
- "Dim moths that gloomed his steps before...

23:21.600 --> 23:24.194
seemed letters of his lovely name. "

23:24.302 --> 23:27.032
- Congratulations, Susie.
- Thank you.

23:27.139 --> 23:29.107
Jean Frame.

23:33.211 --> 23:35.406
- Congratulations,Jean.
- Thank you.

23:40.152 --> 23:42.120
Very good,Jean.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.393
What's in the envelope?

23:53.965 --> 23:56.729
I can go to the Athanaeum free.

23:56.835 --> 23:59.804
Well done, girlie. Well done.

23:59.905 --> 24:01.873
What's the Athanaeum?

24:54.659 --> 24:56.627
Oh, thanks.

25:04.202 --> 25:06.170
Zane Grey.

25:16.715 --> 25:18.683
How wonderful, Nini.

25:31.630 --> 25:34.497
"Twelve Dancing Princesses."

26:32.457 --> 26:35.290
"Thank you for the poems,
Amber Butterfly.

26:35.393 --> 26:40.330
"I loved them very much, and I am making
'Song of the Butterfly' poem of the week.

26:41.633 --> 26:45.091
"I wonder, though, if crocuses,
even poetically...

26:45.203 --> 26:47.763
"dream of the moons.

26:47.872 --> 26:53.037
Write again next week,
and do not mind my friendly criticism. Dot."

27:02.621 --> 27:06.887
Somebody came and took her away

27:06.992 --> 27:10.621
She didn't even
say she was leavin'

27:10.729 --> 27:13.562
- Dad won't let you wear those.

27:13.665 --> 27:15.963
He can't stop me.
They're my wages.

27:18.970 --> 27:22.667
And gee, I know that she'd

27:22.774 --> 27:25.106
Come back to me

27:25.210 --> 27:27.542
If she could see

27:27.646 --> 27:29.876
The brokenhearted lover.

27:29.981 --> 27:33.382
- I have to be at the studio at 6:00 sharp. Okay?
- Okay, chief.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.385
Somebody stole my gal

27:35.487 --> 27:38.388
- Is Johnny going to pick you up?

27:38.490 --> 27:40.390
I suppose so.

27:40.492 --> 27:43.484
Somebody stole my gal

28:07.719 --> 28:11.917
"Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere and ran...

28:12.023 --> 28:14.924
"and leaping down the ridges lightly...

28:15.026 --> 28:17.859
"plunged among the bulrush beds
and clasped the sword...

28:17.962 --> 28:21.659
"and strongly wheeled and threw it.

28:21.766 --> 28:25.497
"The great brand made lightnings
in the splendor of the moon...

28:25.603 --> 28:27.867
"and flashing round and round...

28:27.972 --> 28:30.099
"and whirled in an arc...

28:30.208 --> 28:33.109
"shot like a streamer.
from the northern morn.

28:33.211 --> 28:37.079
"So flashed and fell
the brand Excalibur.

28:38.383 --> 28:40.681
"But ere he dipped the surface...

28:40.785 --> 28:43.379
"rose an arm...

28:43.488 --> 28:45.922
"clad in white samite -

28:46.024 --> 28:49.255
"mystic, wonderful -

28:49.360 --> 28:51.260
"and caught him by the hilt...

28:51.362 --> 28:54.354
"and brandished him three times...

28:54.466 --> 28:57.401
"and drew him under...

28:57.502 --> 28:59.299
in the mere. "

29:02.307 --> 29:05.299
Girls, in your red book...

29:05.410 --> 29:08.470
turn to page 139.

29:12.016 --> 29:13.916
I'm really Spanish, of course...

29:14.018 --> 29:16.179
and I'm Roman Catholic.

29:17.222 --> 29:19.053
What are you?

29:22.894 --> 29:24.919
Our mother's a Christadelphian.

29:26.831 --> 29:29.231
That's a lover of Christ.

29:29.334 --> 29:32.235
Oh, well, the nuns in my church
are the brides of Christ...

29:32.337 --> 29:34.601
and they have to wear
his wedding ring.

29:40.044 --> 29:43.013
Do you want to see me
do a Spanish dance?

29:43.114 --> 29:45.639
Yes, please.

29:58.196 --> 30:00.164
Olй!

30:13.378 --> 30:14.675
Olй!

30:30.461 --> 30:32.588
And this is the sitting room.

30:37.869 --> 30:40.770
Are you allowed
to jump on your Chesterfield?

30:40.872 --> 30:43.670
That's the king's sofa.

30:43.775 --> 30:46.005
I'm getting confirmed soon.

30:46.110 --> 30:49.910
I'm having a whole new ensemble -
all white, even the shoes.

30:51.015 --> 30:53.506
And I get to wear.
this little white veil...

30:54.819 --> 30:57.879
and carry a little white prayer book.

30:57.989 --> 31:00.423
Isabel!

31:02.260 --> 31:05.229
We don't normally sit in here.

31:05.330 --> 31:08.766
She called her desk an escritoire.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.767
Escritoire?

31:10.869 --> 31:13.303
That's what I said.

31:13.404 --> 31:16.840
It's from escrit- to write -
in French.

31:16.941 --> 31:18.841
Olй!

31:24.315 --> 31:25.782
Olй!

31:53.411 --> 31:55.811
She's got the best bosom.

31:55.914 --> 31:59.475
Mmm. I wouldn't give her
full marks for deportment, though.

31:59.584 --> 32:01.484
She's got the most developed figure.

32:01.586 --> 32:03.486
Mmm, no.

32:03.588 --> 32:06.250
 Sexy!
- Ooh-la-la!

32:07.292 --> 32:09.260
I'll show you how I do the turn.

32:11.496 --> 32:14.556
Ooh, that was good.
Do it again.

32:19.270 --> 32:21.636
- Very fancy!

32:21.739 --> 32:24.173
- Nice legs!

32:24.275 --> 32:27.870
Uh, to your left a bit.
No, no, the other way.

32:27.979 --> 32:29.879
No, no, no, no!
Your Left!

32:29.981 --> 32:31.881
- The other way!

32:31.983 --> 32:35.180
- You don't want me in this one.
- Come on. You ready?

32:35.286 --> 32:39.245
Okay, everyone say...

32:39.357 --> 32:41.587
- cheese.
- Cheese!

32:52.837 --> 32:55.465
Oh, look. There's Dad.

32:56.674 --> 32:58.574
Oh!

32:58.676 --> 33:01.577
Ooh, look,Jean.
You've got a titty showing.

33:01.679 --> 33:05.513
- Put that way.
- Titty, titty. Titty, titty, titty.

33:05.616 --> 33:08.176
- Where's Myrtle?
- Myrtle's not there.

33:08.286 --> 33:10.254
Where?

33:31.476 --> 33:35.503
- Coming to the baths?
- I have to get ready for school.

33:35.613 --> 33:37.581
We could go swimming...

33:38.616 --> 33:41.585
and then go downtown
and look at the boys.

33:51.229 --> 33:53.129
- Watch out!
- Coming?

33:53.231 --> 33:55.563
No. I want to do this.

34:02.407 --> 34:05.467
Ooh! Aunt Polly's
only put in two pleats!

34:05.576 --> 34:09.103
How original!

34:17.088 --> 34:19.989
Oh, come on, Nini.
Come to the baths with us.

34:20.091 --> 34:22.559
- You don't want to work.
- I do.

34:23.928 --> 34:26.396
You're so boring.

34:28.099 --> 34:31.000
- Come on, Isabel.
- I'm coming.

34:56.260 --> 34:58.820
C'est un petit garзon.

34:58.930 --> 35:02.764
Il a le chapeau de son pиre.

35:02.867 --> 35:04.767
- Ce garзon est mauvais.

35:04.869 --> 35:07.633
- Nothing today, thank you.

35:14.278 --> 35:16.940
Nothing today, thank you.

35:20.885 --> 35:23.183
Send that child away.

35:25.656 --> 35:27.556
I'm a doctor.

35:27.658 --> 35:30.559
I 've come to tell you
about your daughter Myrtle.

35:30.661 --> 35:32.629
She's drowned at the baths.

35:34.332 --> 35:37.301
- They've taken her body to the morgue.

35:40.171 --> 35:43.140
Is there anybody I can contact for you?

35:56.387 --> 35:58.617
They've taken her to the morgue.

37:25.810 --> 37:27.710
Come on.

37:40.625 --> 37:42.593
Is it Myrtle?

37:45.463 --> 37:47.863
Yes.

37:47.965 --> 37:51.128
- What are you putting in the water?
- Aspro.

37:53.271 --> 37:55.330
It won't bring her back,Jean.

37:55.439 --> 37:59.899
I know that. But the aspros
make the flowers last longer.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.247
Come on.

38:16.727 --> 38:20.094
-That's very nice, isn't it?
- It's quite excellent.

38:20.197 --> 38:22.597
They had to make her a new arm.

38:22.700 --> 38:24.600
For goodness' sake.

38:24.702 --> 38:28.138
The photographer took her
out of a picture with the other kiddies...

38:28.239 --> 38:30.139
and gave her a new arm here.

38:30.241 --> 38:32.141
Oh, you couldn't tell.

38:32.243 --> 38:36.145
It must be a comfort to you, Lottie,
to have such a recent one.

38:36.247 --> 38:38.147
Oh, it is,yes.

38:38.249 --> 38:39.350
She looks so lovely.

38:39.350 --> 38:40.146
She looks so lovely.

38:40.251 --> 38:42.685
- Oh, she was a beautiful girl.
- Yes.

38:42.787 --> 38:46.154
- She's always smiling.

38:46.257 --> 38:48.452
"Till of a sudden...

38:48.559 --> 38:52.256
"maybe killed,
unknown to her mate.

38:52.363 --> 38:55.059
"One forenoon the she-bird crouched...

38:55.166 --> 38:57.066
"not on the nest.

38:57.168 --> 39:00.365
Nor returned that afternoon,
nor the next - "

39:00.471 --> 39:03.099
Jean, is that about Myrtle?

39:04.842 --> 39:07.936
"Nor ever appeared again.

39:08.045 --> 39:10.445
"Whichever way I turn...

39:10.548 --> 39:13.915
"oh, I think you could
give me my mate back again...

39:14.018 --> 39:15.918
"if only you would.

39:16.020 --> 39:21.117
For I am almost sure I see her dimly
whichever way I look."

39:28.733 --> 39:31.395
- Hello, Jean.
- Hello, Poppy.

39:36.474 --> 39:38.442
Do you know I'm doing Commercial?

39:39.343 --> 39:41.675
Yes.

39:42.780 --> 39:45.977
I'm doing shorthand, typing
and double-entry bookkeeping.

39:49.053 --> 39:50.953
Do you like Commercial?

39:51.055 --> 39:52.955
Except for all the grammalogues.

39:53.057 --> 39:55.025
We're always doing grammalogues.

39:56.894 --> 39:58.953
We're doing "Ode to a Nightingale" too.

40:00.865 --> 40:03.925
"Thou wast not born for death,
immortal bird.

40:04.034 --> 40:07.060
"No hungry generations
tread thee down.

40:07.171 --> 40:10.197
"The voice I heard
this passing night...

40:10.307 --> 40:14.403
was heard in ancient days
by emperor and clown."

40:14.512 --> 40:17.481
We have to learn it by heart
for next Tuesday.

40:21.619 --> 40:25.282
- I have to go.
- All right.

40:25.389 --> 40:27.914
- Bye then.
- Bye.

40:33.798 --> 40:35.766
Shirley.

40:37.168 --> 40:39.295
Shirley!

40:40.671 --> 40:42.832
What a dreamer you are, Shirley.

40:42.940 --> 40:47.070
Always lost in the poetic world
of your imagination.

41:00.191 --> 41:05.595
Thou holy art

41:05.696 --> 41:08.096
In many

41:08.199 --> 41:13.102
An hour of sadness

41:14.672 --> 41:18.870
When life's hard toil

41:18.976 --> 41:25.472
My spirit hath oppressed

41:29.286 --> 41:31.447
Hast thou

41:31.555 --> 41:34.718
My heart

41:34.825 --> 41:37.157
Revived

41:37.261 --> 41:42.528
With love and gladness

41:42.633 --> 41:46.763
- And borne my soul
- Shirley's leaving. Her mother died.

41:46.871 --> 41:50.637
Above to realms

41:50.741 --> 41:54.006
Of rest

41:54.111 --> 41:57.547
And borne my soul off

41:57.648 --> 42:03.018
To realms of rest

42:31.215 --> 42:33.183
Come on, girl.

42:36.153 --> 42:38.121
Come on. That's a good girl.

42:48.365 --> 42:50.333
Good girl.

43:07.151 --> 43:09.483
Dearest Mr. Ardenue...

43:09.587 --> 43:13.546
today I wept in class
when we read "The Scholar Gypsy."

43:15.459 --> 43:18.189
He is my ideal man.

43:18.295 --> 43:21.856
I have made up my mind
not to be a teacher.

43:21.966 --> 43:24.264
I'm going to be a poet.

43:46.390 --> 43:48.358
Mum!

43:48.459 --> 43:52.293
Mum! There's blood
between my legs!

43:53.731 --> 43:56.029
Come on. Let's get you
out of that nightie.

43:56.133 --> 43:59.102
I suppose you've
mucked the sheets up as well.

44:00.137 --> 44:04.540
Now, take one end, and you pin it
to the front of your singlet.

44:04.642 --> 44:06.542
Here. Turn round.

44:06.644 --> 44:08.612
That's it. Like that.

44:12.850 --> 44:14.750
Put it between your legs.
That's it.

44:14.852 --> 44:17.753
And then you pin the other end
to the back of the singlet.

44:17.855 --> 44:21.757
Now, you do this first, and then you pull
your clean knickers up over the top.

44:21.859 --> 44:23.759
- It will show.
- No, it won't.

44:23.861 --> 44:25.761
Everyone will see!

44:25.863 --> 44:29.094
Be thankful you started at 15.
Others start at 12.

44:29.199 --> 44:31.667
I'll get you some clean knickers.

44:37.941 --> 44:39.841
For your homework this evening...

44:39.943 --> 44:42.844
I'd like you to continue
working on your projects...

44:42.946 --> 44:45.141
on photo synthesis.

44:45.249 --> 44:47.683
Any problems,
go to your chemistry books...

44:47.785 --> 44:51.846
page 164, chapter 18.

44:51.955 --> 44:54.150
That's it for today.

44:54.258 --> 44:56.590
Carry on, girls.

44:56.694 --> 44:59.663
- Put your. chairs in. Thank you.

45:04.068 --> 45:06.696
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye!

45:12.209 --> 45:16.043
Well, why don't we - You know.

45:16.146 --> 45:18.114
Yeah, okay.

45:22.219 --> 45:24.187
Hi, fuzzy.

45:25.989 --> 45:28.890
You know, you should do something
about your hair.

45:28.992 --> 45:31.119
You could get it straightened.

45:32.663 --> 45:35.188
Or clip it to make it stay flat.

45:39.670 --> 45:41.797
Or oil it or something.

45:43.006 --> 45:45.975
I've never really seen hair like this.

45:47.811 --> 45:50.905
- Look.
- Oh, well. Hmm.

45:53.383 --> 45:56.250
Oh, that's great!
Where did you get that?

46:01.925 --> 46:05.417
No, but-

46:07.564 --> 46:09.464
My brother says...

46:09.566 --> 46:14.731
that Karl Marx is the only rational,
scientific thinker of the last two centuries.

46:17.908 --> 46:20.536
- William's got a lovely personality.

46:20.644 --> 46:23.738
- I saw him at the train station.

46:23.847 --> 46:27.180
I dropped my glove, and he gave it
back to me. Such a gentleman!

46:27.284 --> 46:30.981
- He's like a movie star.

46:31.088 --> 46:33.989
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers,
they've got lovely personalities.

46:34.091 --> 46:37.424
- And it comes out in their style.
- It does, doesn't it?

46:42.866 --> 46:45.494
How many times
do I have to tell you?

46:45.602 --> 46:49.504
He doesn't have to have fits!
He could stop them if he tried!

46:49.606 --> 46:51.164
You don't even care!

46:59.016 --> 47:02.315
Now look what you've done!
You're going to stop this!

47:08.292 --> 47:12.194
Corporal Frame, National Reserve,
at your service.

47:14.298 --> 47:17.324
- They've put Bruddie in the Home Guard.
- Oh, we'll show Hitler!

47:17.434 --> 47:19.527
- We'll show Hitler!
- We'll show him!

47:19.636 --> 47:21.536
Come on, son. Hup! Hup!

47:21.638 --> 47:24.129
By the left, left, march!
Left, march!

47:24.241 --> 47:27.005
- Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup!
- Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup!

47:27.110 --> 47:29.010
Look out, Hitler!

47:29.112 --> 47:32.172
It's a long way to Taumaranui

47:32.282 --> 47:34.182
It's a long way to go

47:34.284 --> 47:36.548
- Left, march! Left, march!

47:36.653 --> 47:39.816
- Left, march! Left, march! Hup! Hup!

47:39.923 --> 47:42.448
Left, right, left, right!

47:45.629 --> 47:49.030
Life is sweet,Jasper.

47:49.132 --> 47:52.693
There's day and night,Jasper.
Both sweet things.

47:54.404 --> 47:58.101
There's sun, moon and stars, brother,
all sweet things.

47:59.643 --> 48:02.510
There's likewise a wind on the heath.

48:03.647 --> 48:06.115
Who would wish to die?

48:10.454 --> 48:12.354
Blah, blah, blah.

48:12.456 --> 48:14.720
Three skirts, three blouses...

48:14.825 --> 48:18.158
two day dresses -
one winter white, one summerwhite -

48:18.262 --> 48:21.163
one special occasion dress...

48:21.265 --> 48:23.665
two jerseys or cardigans...

48:23.767 --> 48:27.726
one pair court shoes,
one pairwalking shoes.

48:29.172 --> 48:32.073
And that's apart from
all the underwear and night clothes.

48:32.175 --> 48:34.575
I found Grandpa's
old dressing gown!

48:34.678 --> 48:36.805
No, Chicks, no.

48:41.285 --> 48:44.982
Two sisters back in our town

48:45.088 --> 48:48.922
Were feeling sorry and blue

48:49.026 --> 48:50.926
- Hello, Fuzz.
- Oh, hello, Fuzz.

48:51.028 --> 48:52.928
The army took their boys away

48:53.030 --> 48:56.488
What else was there to do

48:56.600 --> 49:01.765
They cal led up the sergeant
Called up the captain

49:01.872 --> 49:04.773
Called up the major too

49:04.875 --> 49:08.436
And they asked
what right had the army

49:08.545 --> 49:10.945
To be making them so blue

49:11.048 --> 49:12.948
- Hello,Jean.

49:13.050 --> 49:16.042
I believe it's training college
for you next year,Jean.

49:16.153 --> 49:19.554
Well, I still have to go
for my interview.

49:19.656 --> 49:21.783
Oh, I'm sure you'll be successful.

49:21.892 --> 49:25.293
-  In the land of the free
- Do you like music,Jean?

49:25.395 --> 49:26.953
Oh, yes.

49:27.064 --> 49:29.965
-  We're gonna take a short vacation
- I like Schubert.

49:30.067 --> 49:33.969
- Yes, he's one of my favorites too.

49:34.071 --> 49:36.505
So emotional.

49:36.606 --> 49:40.042
They'll regret it, no doubt

49:42.946 --> 49:44.846
Well, I think I'll mix.

49:44.948 --> 49:47.849
-  She gets a letter

49:47.951 --> 49:49.543
She's feeling better

49:49.653 --> 49:52.781
He's coming home on leave

49:52.889 --> 49:56.290
So we'll string along with the army

49:56.393 --> 50:02.161
In the fight for victory

50:42.506 --> 50:45.737
Pretty face! Pretty face!
Pretty face!

50:52.349 --> 50:55.750
Don't work too hard.
Have a nice time.

50:55.852 --> 50:58.844
- You all right?.
- It is a bit of a wedge, isn't it?

50:58.955 --> 51:01.219
Bye! See you!

51:01.324 --> 51:03.451
You've got to write!
Remember!

51:03.560 --> 51:05.528
- Bye!
- Bye-bye.

52:50.233 --> 52:52.394
- George?

52:52.502 --> 52:55.699
Jean has come to see you.

52:56.773 --> 52:58.741
- This way.
- Huh?

52:58.842 --> 53:01.367
Hello, Uncle George.

53:02.345 --> 53:07.146
So, you're the one who's going
to be a teacher.

53:07.250 --> 53:09.810
She'll be the first in the family.

53:15.358 --> 53:17.883
There we are. Ooh, it's cold.

53:32.442 --> 53:35.707
Yeah, but it's gonna be raining,
so I'll need the umbrella.

53:35.812 --> 53:38.042
- Hi! Fuzzy!
- Well, hello, Fuzz.

53:38.148 --> 53:40.844
- Isn't college fun?
- Oh, yes, isn't it!

53:40.951 --> 53:43.681
I'm doing two subjects
at university too.

53:43.787 --> 53:45.687
- No!
- Oh, you're such a brain.

53:45.789 --> 53:48.519
Do you want to come
and have a cup of coffee? Come on!

53:48.625 --> 53:51.924
- We're going to the Silver Girl now.
- Oh, come on!

53:56.299 --> 53:59.962
You know,Jean, you're welcome
to eat with me in the wee room.

54:01.171 --> 54:03.071
Um, no, thank you, Aunt Isy.

54:03.173 --> 54:05.801
I like to study while I eat.

54:08.845 --> 54:11.814
You vegetarians,
you eat like birds.

54:32.836 --> 54:34.736
Come on. Come on.

54:34.838 --> 54:36.738
Come on, sleepy.

54:36.840 --> 54:41.243
Dear, have you got anything to burn?

54:41.344 --> 54:43.869
Uh, no, thank you, Aunt Isy.
I haven't.

55:26.456 --> 55:28.356
"May I...

55:28.458 --> 55:31.427
"composed like them...

55:31.528 --> 55:33.928
"of Eros and of dust...

55:36.132 --> 55:39.761
"beleaguered by the same
negation and despair...

55:42.372 --> 55:44.670
show an affirming flame."

55:53.516 --> 55:55.416
There's Africa!

55:55.518 --> 55:57.418
You.

55:57.520 --> 56:01.149
That one's like a - like a -

56:01.257 --> 56:03.282
Oh, it's phallic. Everything's phallic.

56:03.393 --> 56:05.293
What's "phallic"?

56:05.395 --> 56:08.296
It's from "phallus," the Latin for "penis."

56:08.398 --> 56:10.298
- Like a dong?

56:10.400 --> 56:12.698
Oh, look.
Even our knees are phallic.

56:14.804 --> 56:17.204
You'll read Freud at college.

56:17.307 --> 56:19.400
Oh, I can't wait to get there.

56:19.509 --> 56:21.602
I'll be all alone.

56:21.711 --> 56:24.179
Poor baby. All alone.

56:24.280 --> 56:26.407
No.

56:27.717 --> 56:30.618
- You can have Jack when I'm gone.

56:30.720 --> 56:33.689
We have coffee in the union aftertutes.

56:35.425 --> 56:37.393
And you should see Mr. Forrest.

56:38.661 --> 56:40.925
- He's the psych lecturer.
- Mmm!

56:42.332 --> 56:44.300
He's gorgeous!

56:46.669 --> 56:48.569
He's like Ashley in Gone With the Wind!

56:51.207 --> 56:54.734
Ashley! Ashley!
Come to me, Ashley!

56:54.844 --> 56:58.302
- Ashley, I need you!

57:02.385 --> 57:04.683
I'm not gonna share.

57:04.788 --> 57:08.485
- There's enough room.
- What for? Midgets?

57:08.591 --> 57:10.491
Hey.

57:10.593 --> 57:12.493
See?

57:12.595 --> 57:14.495
Try it.

57:14.597 --> 57:16.929
She must be mad.

57:17.033 --> 57:18.933
I'm gonna tell Mum.

57:19.035 --> 57:21.003
Oh, no, don't say anything.

57:21.104 --> 57:23.436
Why not? We paid.

57:23.540 --> 57:25.508
But not very much.

57:27.110 --> 57:29.670
Isabel, please!

57:39.322 --> 57:41.847
She won them
for her highland dancin'.

57:42.959 --> 57:46.122
They've never been opened.
Look.

57:49.566 --> 57:52.057
- Let's open one.
- No, we can't.

57:52.168 --> 57:54.068
She won't know.

57:58.942 --> 58:01.843
I suppose we could taste one.

58:01.945 --> 58:04.243
Yes, let's taste one.

58:04.347 --> 58:06.315
Give us a hand.

58:07.550 --> 58:09.643
Got it.

58:13.990 --> 58:15.958
Hello, little kitty.

58:28.338 --> 58:30.238
You choose first.

58:30.340 --> 58:32.308
Go on.

58:33.977 --> 58:39.108
With the cross of Jesus

58:39.215 --> 58:43.242
- Going on before
- Mmm!

58:43.353 --> 58:46.914
Mmm. It's not musty at all.

58:50.026 --> 58:51.994
You taste one.

58:54.931 --> 58:56.831
We shouldn't be doing this.

58:56.933 --> 58:59.527
I know. Go on.

59:17.687 --> 59:20.918
Steve wants me to go all the way.

59:21.024 --> 59:24.619
- We nearly did it tonight.

59:27.397 --> 59:30.389
We only just stopped in time.

59:33.069 --> 59:36.766
- This house is like a morgue.

59:40.209 --> 59:43.042
What about your essay?

59:43.146 --> 59:47.048
It's too late.
I'll do it tomorrow in the union.

59:49.152 --> 59:52.121
Why don't you
ever come in to the union?

59:54.123 --> 59:56.091
Where do you go?

01:00:10.573 --> 01:00:13.474
Too shy to mix...

01:00:13.576 --> 01:00:16.374
too scared to enter.
the union building...

01:00:17.547 --> 01:00:19.515
I was more and more alone.

01:00:22.185 --> 01:00:25.348
My only romance
was in poetry and literature.

01:00:33.496 --> 01:00:35.464
Hello.

01:00:36.866 --> 01:00:39.835
Oh. I was just going, Mr. Forrest.

01:00:39.936 --> 01:00:43.702
Oh, that's all right.
There's no rules about eating in here.

01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:45.774
It's a bit smelly, though.

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:06.295
What do you think he does
with all that lanolin?

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:11.228
Maybe he rubs it on his thing.

01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:14.235
Or maybe Aunt Isy
rubs it on for him.

01:01:18.841 --> 01:01:21.639
- What's that?
- Aunt Isy

01:01:21.744 --> 01:01:23.575
Oh!

01:01:23.746 --> 01:01:25.941
- Hurry up.

01:01:30.053 --> 01:01:32.021
Quick.

01:01:33.423 --> 01:01:35.391
Hurryup! She's coming!

01:01:36.426 --> 01:01:38.326
Here!
Here, here, here, here, here!

01:01:38.428 --> 01:01:40.828
By our good Lord.

01:02:14.664 --> 01:02:16.564
You're just liars!

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:18.566
And thieves!

01:02:18.668 --> 01:02:21.865
Telling your parents
those untruths!

01:02:21.971 --> 01:02:24.838
Stealing my trophies!

01:02:24.941 --> 01:02:28.069
Wicked, wicked girls!

01:02:42.658 --> 01:02:44.626
Wait.

01:02:46.262 --> 01:02:48.628
Come on, Siggy! Come on!

01:02:52.735 --> 01:02:55.295
Willowglen sat high on a hill.

01:02:55.404 --> 01:02:58.999
It had belonged in turn
to various derelict families.

01:02:59.108 --> 01:03:02.839
Now it was ours,
the first home we had owned.

01:03:09.352 --> 01:03:11.320
Here we are.

01:03:21.764 --> 01:03:24.164
They found out about me, Mum.

01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:26.064
Ah, never mind, laddie.

01:03:26.169 --> 01:03:27.966
- Not again.
- Curly!

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:30.300
Epilepsy's nothing to be ashamed of.

01:03:30.406 --> 01:03:33.307
He can't even
keep a job for two days. Two days!

01:03:33.409 --> 01:03:34.876
No!

01:03:38.514 --> 01:03:40.482
What's the use?

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:54.395
Come down onto the flat
and sit in the sun.

01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:57.398
One of these days
I'll come and sit in the sun.

01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:00.958
- Why not now?
- I've too much to do.

01:04:04.607 --> 01:04:07.576
No one's asking you
to be a workhorse.

01:04:12.615 --> 01:04:15.516
I worried about next year..

01:04:15.618 --> 01:04:19.145
My clothes, money...

01:04:19.255 --> 01:04:23.214
and where I would live
now Isabel wanted to share with friends.

01:04:28.631 --> 01:04:31.031
How about a bit of Tchaikovsky?

01:04:36.172 --> 01:04:38.072
Hello, Eunice, Mary.

01:04:38.174 --> 01:04:40.233
What do you think
of my tomato socks?

01:04:40.343 --> 01:04:42.174
Lovely.

01:04:42.278 --> 01:04:45.179
- Unusual.
- Unusual?

01:04:45.281 --> 01:04:47.340
-And bright.
- Ofcourse they're bright.

01:05:00.463 --> 01:05:02.624
I love this bit there.

01:05:28.658 --> 01:05:30.626
Miss Frame?

01:05:32.662 --> 01:05:34.630
Oh, there you are.

01:05:36.699 --> 01:05:38.997
Are you coming to morning tea?

01:05:40.102 --> 01:05:43.936
Oh - Oh, uh, no.
I'm a bit busy.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:47.806
Oh. We never see you.

01:05:49.211 --> 01:05:51.179
Maybe tomorrow.

01:05:53.716 --> 01:05:56.014
Oh, you've made the room lovely.

01:06:13.102 --> 01:06:16.003
So this was how it was...

01:06:16.105 --> 01:06:19.131
face to face with the future.

01:06:19.241 --> 01:06:21.300
Living apart from Isabel...

01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:23.776
pretending that I was not alone...

01:06:23.879 --> 01:06:27.508
and that teaching was what
I'd longed to do all my life.

01:06:29.618 --> 01:06:32.314
- Izzy! Isabel!
- What did they say?

01:06:32.421 --> 01:06:35.322
- Izzy!
- Have you heard about the bomb?

01:06:35.424 --> 01:06:37.824
- What bomb?
- They dropped a bomb on Japan!

01:06:37.927 --> 01:06:39.827
- They've killed millions of Japanese!

01:06:39.929 --> 01:06:42.557
- It's a new kind of bomb!
- So have we won the war?

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:45.293
- Yes!
- Let's go tell the others!

01:06:46.469 --> 01:06:48.369
Coming?

01:06:49.972 --> 01:06:52.941
- Isabel, come on!
- Where did you hear it?

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:26.171
We have a very important visitor
with us today, Second Class.

01:07:26.275 --> 01:07:30.905
I'd like you to say good morning
to our inspector, Mr. Niles.

01:07:31.013 --> 01:07:34.414
Good morning, Mr. Niles.

01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:36.917
Good morning, children.
Good, thanks.

01:07:37.019 --> 01:07:39.920
- And how are you, Miss Frame?
- Very well, thank you.

01:07:40.022 --> 01:07:43.423
That's good. I'll sit at the back,
and you just carry on as normal.

01:07:43.526 --> 01:07:45.494
Forget I'm here.

01:08:53.028 --> 01:08:55.258
What's she doing?

01:09:08.377 --> 01:09:11.938
M-Mr Niles, would you
excuse me for a minute, please?

01:09:12.046 --> 01:09:14.607
Certainly, Miss Frame.

01:11:19.375 --> 01:11:21.809
What about teaching?

01:11:22.678 --> 01:11:24.908
I've given it up.

01:11:25.014 --> 01:11:27.448
I've got a doctor's certificate.

01:11:27.549 --> 01:11:30.518
But you've always wanted
to be a teacher.

01:11:31.754 --> 01:11:35.281
- I'm going to be a writer.
- But how will you earn money?

01:11:40.462 --> 01:11:43.659
- How will you live?
- I'll work here in the kitchen.

01:11:43.766 --> 01:11:47.293
- I'll study psych at university.
- What about your scholarship?

01:11:49.605 --> 01:11:51.539
What about Mum and Dad?

01:12:00.449 --> 01:12:02.576
I can't believe it.

01:12:16.532 --> 01:12:19.057
I really enjoyed
your autobiography, Janet.

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:22.399
It's very natural.
It's got a nice flow to it.

01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:24.972
The others were all
so stiff and serious.

01:12:25.074 --> 01:12:27.065
You've got a real talent for writing.

01:12:28.277 --> 01:12:30.802
I've had a story published
in The Listener.

01:12:30.913 --> 01:12:33.643
Oh. So I'm not wrong then.

01:12:38.387 --> 01:12:41.254
You must have had difficulty
swallowing all those aspros.

01:12:44.793 --> 01:12:49.025
No. I - I just drank them with water.
It wasn't hard.

01:12:49.131 --> 01:12:51.099
They just went down.

01:13:07.516 --> 01:13:10.280
"You have a real talent for writing."

01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:30.338
"You have a real talent
for writing."

01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:34.371
-Janet.
- Yes?

01:13:34.476 --> 01:13:37.343
Three men from the university
to see you.

01:13:45.854 --> 01:13:47.981
Ah.

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:50.558
- Hello, Janet.
- Evening, Janet.

01:13:50.659 --> 01:13:52.627
- Hello,Janet.
- Hello.

01:13:55.063 --> 01:13:57.258
Uh, Mr. Forrest has been telling me...

01:13:57.366 --> 01:14:00.335
that, uh, you haven't been
feeling all that well lately...

01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:04.133
and, well, we thought
that you might like a little rest.

01:14:05.808 --> 01:14:09.471
Oh. N-No, I'm fine now, thank you.

01:14:09.578 --> 01:14:12.479
Well, i-it wouldn't be for long.
Just, uh -

01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:16.415
Well, just have a little rest
and let us look after you for a while.

01:14:18.253 --> 01:14:20.153
Really, I'm all right.

01:14:20.255 --> 01:14:22.519
John would come to visit you.
Wouldn't you, John?

01:14:22.624 --> 01:14:24.524
Of course I would, yeah.

01:14:24.626 --> 01:14:26.594
In hospital?

01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:31.466
Well, yes, we think
it would be best for you.

01:14:33.769 --> 01:14:36.567
- Do you think so?
- I do.

01:15:30.058 --> 01:15:31.958
Come on, Nini.

01:15:36.231 --> 01:15:38.426
I can't go home.

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:41.401
- Well, you can't stay here.
- No, I don't want to stay here.

01:15:41.503 --> 01:15:44.199
Well, where can you go?

01:15:44.306 --> 01:15:48.402
Look, after a holiday at home,
you'll be as good as new.

01:15:52.214 --> 01:15:54.512
Go away!

01:15:57.185 --> 01:16:01.986
- She's usually such a happy girl.
- Go away!

01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:04.957
We'd better go.

01:16:06.862 --> 01:16:09.330
Perhaps she just needs a little more rest.

01:16:18.307 --> 01:16:22.641
- I had a little dog -
- And his name was -
- Spot.

01:16:22.744 --> 01:16:25.736
- I had a little dog -
- And his name was -

01:16:25.847 --> 01:16:27.815
- Spot.
- I had a little dog -

01:16:27.916 --> 01:16:30.316
- And his name was -
- Spot.

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:34.412
- I had a little dog, and his name was -
- Spot.

01:16:34.523 --> 01:16:37.492
- I had a little dog -
- And his name was -

01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:40.255
- Spot.
- I had a little dog -

01:16:40.362 --> 01:16:42.387
- And his name was -
- Spot.

01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:46.301
Here we go again.

01:16:48.303 --> 01:16:50.203
Come back!

01:16:54.309 --> 01:16:57.506
Here we go. Here we go.

01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:34.978
Pits.

01:17:39.921 --> 01:17:42.151
I 've got schizophrenia.

01:17:42.257 --> 01:17:44.157
What's that?

01:17:48.764 --> 01:17:53.133
"Dementia praecox,
otherwise known as schizophrenia.

01:17:53.235 --> 01:17:55.897
"A gradual deterioration of the mind...

01:17:56.004 --> 01:17:57.972
with no cure."

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:34.365
Janet.

01:18:34.476 --> 01:18:38.776
I've talked to a Mrs. Chandler.
in Christchurch about your case.

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:41.713
She's very interested in you.

01:18:41.817 --> 01:18:43.876
I think you'll like her too.

01:18:43.985 --> 01:18:46.249
Do you mean
I should go and see her?

01:18:46.354 --> 01:18:48.345
I think you should.

01:18:48.457 --> 01:18:52.553
I've shown your stories and poems
to Denis Glover of Caxton.

01:18:52.661 --> 01:18:54.754
He's very impressed.

01:18:57.365 --> 01:19:01.392
You know, Janet, when I think of you,
I think of van Gogh, Hugo Wolf.

01:19:01.503 --> 01:19:04.131
Lots of artists have suffered
from schizophrenia.

01:19:11.213 --> 01:19:13.647
Bruddie?

01:19:17.953 --> 01:19:20.922
You should be the one going, Nini,
not me.

01:19:22.691 --> 01:19:24.659
Oh, no. I couldn't.

01:19:27.562 --> 01:19:29.587
You'd be the best one.

01:19:29.698 --> 01:19:33.725
Whoever goes, you've got to make sure
Mum has a lovely trip.

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:38.968
- It's most of my money!

01:19:39.074 --> 01:19:42.237
- No, it's not. It's mostly Janet's money.
- Yeah.

01:19:42.344 --> 01:19:45.802
- No, it's not. I worked for it.
- I earn more money than you do.

01:19:45.914 --> 01:19:47.939
Work for it? Huh.

01:19:50.752 --> 01:19:53.220
Oh, dear, dear, dear.
I don't know.

01:19:53.321 --> 01:19:55.619
-What don't you know?

01:19:55.724 --> 01:19:57.692
Put your feet up.

01:19:57.793 --> 01:20:00.421
- I'm all right.
- Come on.

01:20:01.763 --> 01:20:05.028
There. You're on holidays, Mum.

01:20:05.133 --> 01:20:09.797
Stop worrying.
Poor old trotters.

01:20:21.817 --> 01:20:24.786
- It's mine!

01:20:24.886 --> 01:20:26.786
Hello?

01:20:34.262 --> 01:20:36.162
Yeah.

01:20:36.264 --> 01:20:38.232
Yeah. Okay.

01:20:51.313 --> 01:20:53.281
It's Isabel.

01:20:55.050 --> 01:20:57.746
She drowned in Picton Harbour.

01:21:37.959 --> 01:21:40.484
It's to stop her from smelling.

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:47.400
Bruddie.

01:21:50.639 --> 01:21:52.607
Mum, your hair - it's white.

01:21:53.708 --> 01:21:55.676
- Oh, Curly!

01:21:55.777 --> 01:21:57.745
A second one taken.

01:22:01.216 --> 01:22:06.119
We just don't know what to say,
but call on us if you want any help.

01:22:06.221 --> 01:22:09.088
- We're here. We're sorry
we didn't come to the church.
- Is Janet coming out?

01:22:09.190 --> 01:22:12.091
We knew you had
closer family and friends...

01:22:12.193 --> 01:22:16.527
and we kept in the background
for that reason.

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:22.362
Why don't you come out, Nini?

01:22:46.928 --> 01:22:50.557
I comforted myself with writing...

01:22:50.665 --> 01:22:53.862
yet I could not stay at Willowglen...

01:22:53.969 --> 01:22:57.598
nor was there any escape
from the horror of my decayed teeth.

01:23:09.417 --> 01:23:11.681
Hello. Come in.

01:23:16.725 --> 01:23:19.285
- I'm Janet Frame.
- Oh.

01:23:19.394 --> 01:23:21.862
John Forrest wrote to me about you.

01:23:24.299 --> 01:23:26.290
Will you help me with my teeth?

01:23:27.402 --> 01:23:31.361
Your teeth?
I don't understand.

01:23:37.412 --> 01:23:41.041
Oh, dear.

01:23:41.149 --> 01:23:43.982
I'm afraid you're gonna have to
have those out.

01:23:44.085 --> 01:23:45.985
Will you come with me?

01:23:47.288 --> 01:23:49.381
Well, yes, I could.

01:23:56.664 --> 01:23:58.962
After you've had your teeth seen to...

01:23:59.067 --> 01:24:01.592
I'd like you to go
to Sunnyside Hospital.

01:24:01.703 --> 01:24:05.230
They have a new treatment there
which appears to be successful.

01:24:07.442 --> 01:24:09.342
Is it curable?

01:24:09.444 --> 01:24:13.744
With this new treatment,
yes, I think it may be.

01:24:38.873 --> 01:24:42.172
- Nurse?

01:24:51.853 --> 01:24:53.821
You're a newie, aren't you?

01:24:56.558 --> 01:24:58.822
Come on. Legs up.
That's the way. Get yourself comfy.

01:24:58.927 --> 01:25:02.385
- Where are your teeth?
- I've just had them pulled out.

01:25:02.497 --> 01:25:04.863
Ooh.

01:25:07.502 --> 01:25:10.266
- Have you eaten today?

01:25:10.371 --> 01:25:12.396
Oh! Oops-a-day.

01:25:14.008 --> 01:25:17.967
No! There's God! There's God!

01:25:18.079 --> 01:25:20.309
- That's a good girl.
- There's God -

01:25:20.415 --> 01:25:22.440
-All right, Doctor.

01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:26.008
Good morning. Well, then,
we know what this is all about.

01:25:26.121 --> 01:25:28.316
Lie down. That's all right.

01:25:28.423 --> 01:25:30.584
Legs down. Legs down.

01:25:30.692 --> 01:25:32.956
- Nice and calm.
- Matron.

01:25:33.061 --> 01:25:35.962
Yes. Close your eyes.
Ready, Doctor?

01:26:03.424 --> 01:26:05.392
Over the next eightyears...

01:26:05.493 --> 01:26:09.156
I received more than 200 applications
of electric shock treatment...

01:26:10.298 --> 01:26:13.062
each one equivalent in fear.
to an execution.

01:26:38.826 --> 01:26:41.260
Hurry up!

01:26:41.362 --> 01:26:44.490
- On the go.
- Come on. Hurry.

01:26:45.767 --> 01:26:48.497
Are you all right?

01:26:48.603 --> 01:26:50.468
I'm all right.

01:26:56.544 --> 01:26:59.513
- Hurry up.
- I don't want to go while they're watching.

01:27:03.918 --> 01:27:06.716
There's no one watching!

01:27:06.821 --> 01:27:08.789
Come on, go!

01:27:10.291 --> 01:27:12.953
- Miss Educated!
- Yeah.

01:27:27.508 --> 01:27:30.341
- There you are.

01:27:30.445 --> 01:27:32.913
Blue smoke

01:27:33.014 --> 01:27:35.710
Goes drifting by

01:27:35.817 --> 01:27:41.119
Into the deep blue sky

01:27:41.222 --> 01:27:44.487
When I think of home

01:27:44.592 --> 01:27:49.495
I sadly sigh

01:27:49.597 --> 01:27:54.159
Oh, I can see you there

01:27:54.269 --> 01:27:59.605
With loving tears in your eyes

01:27:59.707 --> 01:28:03.507
As we fondly said

01:28:03.611 --> 01:28:07.240
Our last good-byes

01:28:08.816 --> 01:28:12.843
And as I sailed away

01:28:12.954 --> 01:28:16.185
With a longing to stay

01:28:16.291 --> 01:28:21.558
- I promised to be true

01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:08.168
- I've got your books.
- Good work,Janet.

01:29:08.276 --> 01:29:11.541
-Jolly good work.
- They've published them.

01:29:27.562 --> 01:29:31.760
- Where's my photograph?
- That's not the important thing.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.868
- Wh-Where's my photograph?
- The important thing is that you're an author.

01:29:39.507 --> 01:29:41.839
What do I do?

01:29:43.244 --> 01:29:45.508
You sign it here...

01:29:45.613 --> 01:29:48.081
on the inside front page.

01:29:49.250 --> 01:29:52.549
- Is that what you do?
- Mmm.

01:30:01.529 --> 01:30:03.497
Good. Next one.

01:30:08.202 --> 01:30:10.602
They'll be worth a fortune
one day,Janet.

01:30:19.614 --> 01:30:21.514
Good.

01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:24.650
Sit down.

01:30:33.895 --> 01:30:36.557
We're putting you down
for that new operation.

01:30:40.968 --> 01:30:42.936
What new operation?

01:30:43.037 --> 01:30:45.904
You're going to have a leukotomy.

01:30:48.075 --> 01:30:50.475
There's no need to be frightened.

01:30:50.578 --> 01:30:52.808
It'll do you the world of good.

01:30:55.116 --> 01:30:57.084
Do I have to have one?

01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:02.117
It's not a question of"have to."
It's a question of what's best.

01:31:03.524 --> 01:31:06.459
Your mother has agreed.
She signed the papers.

01:31:30.418 --> 01:31:32.386
What do you think?

01:31:33.521 --> 01:31:36.547
Do you think they'll get out?

01:31:36.657 --> 01:31:40.559
I think once you're here,
you never get out.

01:32:09.624 --> 01:32:13.651
Fear... no... more...

01:32:14.729 --> 01:32:16.663
the heat...

01:32:16.764 --> 01:32:20.097
of the sun...

01:32:21.469 --> 01:32:26.338
nor the furious...

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:29.170
winter's...

01:32:29.277 --> 01:32:31.677
rages.

01:32:31.779 --> 01:32:34.680
Now thy...

01:32:34.782 --> 01:32:39.048
worldly... task...

01:32:39.153 --> 01:32:41.519
is done.

01:32:51.432 --> 01:32:53.457
Oh. Hello.

01:32:53.568 --> 01:32:56.594
-Janet, isn't it?
- Dr. Palmer, what do you think?

01:32:56.704 --> 01:33:01.266
- About the prize?
- No. About the leukotomy.

01:33:01.375 --> 01:33:04.606
You've won the Hubert Church Award...

01:33:04.712 --> 01:33:07.579
for your book of short stories,
The Lagoon.

01:33:09.717 --> 01:33:14.086
Oh. I'm not going
to have the operation?

01:33:14.188 --> 01:33:16.088
No.

01:33:16.190 --> 01:33:18.658
I think you should stay in hospital
a little longer....

01:33:18.759 --> 01:33:22.126
until you're more confident
and stronger..

01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:25.130
And then we'll see
about getting you home.

01:34:11.112 --> 01:34:13.080
Seacliff Station, please.

01:35:02.263 --> 01:35:05.130
I don't want you
to leave home again ever.

01:35:07.835 --> 01:35:09.735
Okay, chief.

01:35:14.008 --> 01:35:18.308
- You're not going back to that nuthouse.
- With all those loonies?

01:35:19.447 --> 01:35:21.574
Aw, Dad.

01:35:21.682 --> 01:35:24.651
It's my private rest home
you're talking about.

01:35:31.058 --> 01:35:33.026
Why don't you eat with us?

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:41.728
Why don't you live
in your own house?

01:35:43.104 --> 01:35:45.072
Have you got any children?

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:49.268
Boys, come on.
Leave Auntie Janet alone, please.

01:35:49.376 --> 01:35:51.606
- Come have your tea.
- All right.

01:35:51.712 --> 01:35:53.612
Come on.

01:35:55.416 --> 01:35:58.180
Can you see something
out the window? Out.

01:35:58.285 --> 01:36:01.743
Frank Sargeson, the writer,
lives around here in an old bach.

01:36:03.023 --> 01:36:06.720
He came to visit me.
He heard I was your sister.

01:36:06.827 --> 01:36:09.887
- He asked if you'd like to go and see him.
- We could drop in now.

01:36:09.997 --> 01:36:13.899
No! I don't know him.

01:36:23.978 --> 01:36:25.946
He's not home.

01:36:27.515 --> 01:36:30.609
- Hello.
- You're Janet Frame?

01:36:30.718 --> 01:36:33.186
Come in. Come in.

01:36:34.488 --> 01:36:36.456
We'll come back later.

01:36:43.097 --> 01:36:45.895
Why don't you come and live here?

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:49.458
There's a bed and desk
in the hut out back already set up.

01:36:50.871 --> 01:36:53.738
Well, you can't write
living in suburbia...

01:36:54.975 --> 01:36:58.172
amongst the nappies
and the bourgeois life.

01:36:59.547 --> 01:37:01.572
But I have to find a job.

01:37:01.682 --> 01:37:04.310
Why?

01:37:04.418 --> 01:37:06.386
You're a writer.

01:37:08.656 --> 01:37:10.749
They've refused me
the sickness benefit.

01:37:10.858 --> 01:37:12.883
Oh, have they?

01:37:12.993 --> 01:37:16.588
After all those years in hospital,
they can't do that.

01:37:18.966 --> 01:37:21.161
Look, I've got a good friend
who's a doctor.

01:37:21.268 --> 01:37:24.601
He'll fix you up with a benefit.
Of course he will.

01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:28.508
Would you like to come and look?

01:38:16.323 --> 01:38:18.257
"It was a sin...

01:38:18.359 --> 01:38:22.295
"to have watched Aunt Nettie
putting on her face...

01:38:22.396 --> 01:38:24.694
- "and it was worse -
- No, don't.

01:38:24.798 --> 01:38:26.925
- "it was worse for her, I suppose...
- Frank!

01:38:27.034 --> 01:38:30.470
"because now we knew
she had another face...

01:38:30.571 --> 01:38:32.801
- "and had another smile to it.
- Frank!

01:38:32.907 --> 01:38:35.774
"We'd found her out like a thief.

01:38:35.876 --> 01:38:38.344
She kept blushing."

01:38:41.949 --> 01:38:44.417
Not bad.

01:38:44.518 --> 01:38:47.715
Bit... Dylan Thomas-ish.

01:38:51.892 --> 01:38:55.020
Don't worry I fit comes back.
It's only your first try.

01:38:56.297 --> 01:38:58.197
Just remember, Waldo...

01:38:58.299 --> 01:39:00.631
there's always another publisher.

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:10.035
- Aha!Maiden bearing gramophone.
- All right.

01:39:14.815 --> 01:39:16.783
I brought these records.

01:39:20.321 --> 01:39:22.516
- Are you pouring, Frank?

01:39:22.623 --> 01:39:25.490
"We had fed the heart on fantasies.

01:39:25.592 --> 01:39:28.288
"The heart's grown brutal
from the fare.

01:39:28.395 --> 01:39:32.126
"More substance in our enmities
than in our love.

01:39:32.232 --> 01:39:36.464
"Oh, honey bees, come build
in the empty house...

01:39:36.570 --> 01:39:38.470
of a stare."

01:39:38.572 --> 01:39:41.040
That's wonderful.

01:39:43.410 --> 01:39:45.878
I've only read his earlier works.

01:39:45.980 --> 01:39:49.541
"Tread softly because
you tread on my dreams"?

01:39:49.650 --> 01:39:52.312
"I went out to the hazel wood
because a fire was in my head."

01:39:52.419 --> 01:39:54.683
- "Till the moon has taken flight.
- KarI!

01:39:54.788 --> 01:39:57.120
- "To and fro we leap...
- Shh.

01:39:57.224 --> 01:39:59.351
- "and chase the frothy bubbles.
- You're shouting.

01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:01.860
"While the world is full of troubles...

01:40:01.962 --> 01:40:04.089
- "come away, oh, human child...
- Shh.

01:40:04.198 --> 01:40:06.291
"to the waters and the wild...

01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:09.995
"with a fairy hand in hand.

01:40:10.104 --> 01:40:12.402
- "Cause the world's more full of weeping...
- Shh.

01:40:12.506 --> 01:40:15.737
than you can understand. "

01:40:45.472 --> 01:40:48.202
Frank!

01:40:49.943 --> 01:40:51.843
Frank!

01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:55.148
- Frank?

01:41:08.028 --> 01:41:10.622
First up.

01:41:10.731 --> 01:41:13.529
I can't believe it.

01:41:14.635 --> 01:41:17.103
Well, not everyone's
that lucky, Waldo...

01:41:17.204 --> 01:41:19.468
not on their first try.

01:41:19.573 --> 01:41:22.041
Something must have clicked
with them.

01:41:24.044 --> 01:41:27.502
- Well, congratulations.

01:41:28.749 --> 01:41:32.310
- It's amazing.

01:41:41.562 --> 01:41:45.464
- To Frank,
the next step was obvious.

01:41:45.566 --> 01:41:47.966
I needed to broaden my experience.

01:41:48.068 --> 01:41:52.471
He organized my application
for a literary grant to travel overseas.

01:41:52.573 --> 01:41:57.442
I knew that if I stayed, there would be
no second chance for my survival.

01:42:07.221 --> 01:42:10.520
So, you're off
to the old country, eh?

01:42:11.558 --> 01:42:13.924
Good on you, girl.
Good on you.

01:42:21.969 --> 01:42:23.869
Mr. Frame.

01:42:26.006 --> 01:42:28.031
This is Frank Sargeson.

01:42:28.142 --> 01:42:30.042
My father.

01:42:32.279 --> 01:42:35.806
Oh, you've got a very clever
daughter there, Mr. Frame.

01:42:38.085 --> 01:42:39.985
Thank you.

01:42:47.461 --> 01:42:49.759
Bye-bye.

01:42:49.863 --> 01:42:51.797
Bon voyage.

01:43:51.258 --> 01:43:54.625
Time and chance are but a tide

01:43:54.728 --> 01:43:57.754
Ha ha, the wooing o'it

01:43:57.864 --> 01:44:00.924
Slighted love is sair to bide

01:44:01.034 --> 01:44:04.026
Ha ha, the wooing o'it

01:44:04.137 --> 01:44:06.935
"Shall I like a fool," quoth he

01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:10.134
For a haughty hizzie die

01:44:10.244 --> 01:44:13.475
She may go to France for me

01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:17.016
Ha ha, the wooing o'it

01:44:25.559 --> 01:44:29.723
- What happened to you two?

01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:32.390
Ah, we've just been, uh,
looking around.

01:44:32.499 --> 01:44:34.865
What have you been up to?

01:44:38.872 --> 01:44:41.864
- Isn't it absolutely gorgeous?

01:44:44.311 --> 01:44:46.779
Can I help you?

01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:49.348
Oh, no, thank you.

01:44:54.187 --> 01:44:57.315
Was that the one
in the white tuxedo?

01:44:57.424 --> 01:44:59.483
Oh, I love it.
What's his name?

01:44:59.593 --> 01:45:01.561
We should go then.

01:45:44.938 --> 01:45:46.906
Hello. I'm Janet Frame.

01:45:47.007 --> 01:45:50.272
I wrote and reserved a room.

01:45:50.377 --> 01:45:52.277
Frame.

01:45:59.386 --> 01:46:01.786
No, I have no "Frame."

01:46:07.461 --> 01:46:10.919
- But I wrote.
- No, we've had no letter from you.

01:46:15.902 --> 01:46:20.635
- But I'm all the way from New Zealand.
- We have guests staying here from all over the world.

01:46:22.743 --> 01:46:25.473
Have you no friends in London?

01:46:25.579 --> 01:46:28.070
None.

01:46:29.683 --> 01:46:32.345
Why don't you try the Y.W.C.A.?.

01:47:03.083 --> 01:47:06.280
Well, I hope you won't
be here for the winter.

01:47:07.587 --> 01:47:10.215
We had a woman die of pneumonia
in one of these rooms.

01:47:10.323 --> 01:47:12.757
That one.

01:47:12.859 --> 01:47:15.760
We had a crown prince of Europe
in this one last year.

01:47:21.368 --> 01:47:23.859
There.

01:47:23.970 --> 01:47:26.336
You can call me Patrick.

01:47:29.810 --> 01:47:32.278
So, what you doin' in London, Janet?

01:47:32.379 --> 01:47:35.177
Oh, I'm here on a literary grant.

01:47:35.282 --> 01:47:37.250
A literary grant?

01:47:39.486 --> 01:47:42.751
But I'm not going to stay in London
for very long.

01:47:42.856 --> 01:47:44.824
I'm going to go to Spain.

01:47:47.260 --> 01:47:49.353
It's cheaper there.

01:47:49.463 --> 01:47:53.490
- You're not going on your own?
- Yes.

01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:56.933
Well, you'll be in danger
in a foreign place like that, Janet.

01:47:57.037 --> 01:47:59.335
I'll look after you
while you're in London...

01:47:59.439 --> 01:48:01.873
but you mustn't go to the continent
on your own.

01:48:04.511 --> 01:48:06.979
By the way, are you fancy-free?

01:48:11.551 --> 01:48:13.519
Yes, I'm fancy-free.

01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:17.852
Then watch out for the blacks.
They're everywhere in London.

01:48:17.958 --> 01:48:22.258
I don't think that someone should be
referred to by the color of their skin.

01:48:22.362 --> 01:48:24.353
You wait and see.

01:48:26.733 --> 01:48:29.429
Oh. Well.

01:48:29.536 --> 01:48:31.436
Come on.

01:48:32.973 --> 01:48:34.873
Thank you.

01:48:38.612 --> 01:48:41.012
Here we are. Smells good.
Here you go.

01:48:41.114 --> 01:48:44.880
- Now, this is paella, Janet.
- Oh, yes, the Spanish dish.

01:48:44.985 --> 01:48:47.283
I learnt to make it
when I was living there.

01:48:47.387 --> 01:48:51.289
- What were you doing in Spain?
- Oh, I'm an artist, so I lived up there
for a while and worked.

01:48:51.391 --> 01:48:53.291
- Katie?
- Yes?

01:48:53.393 --> 01:48:56.954
Why don't you write to Colin
and tell him Janet's going to Ibiza?

01:48:57.063 --> 01:49:00.157
Yeah, well, definitely.
Colin's a really nice guy.

01:49:00.267 --> 01:49:03.725
In fact, he'll show you around.
In fact, he's gorgeous.

01:49:03.837 --> 01:49:06.704
So, uh, what do you write, Janet?

01:49:06.806 --> 01:49:09.604
- Oh, um, poetry and fiction.
- Mm-hmm.

01:49:09.709 --> 01:49:12.177
Some short stories,
and I've written a novel.

01:49:12.279 --> 01:49:14.270
- Have you had anything published?
- Yes.

01:49:14.381 --> 01:49:18.750
- For which magazine?
- Um, no. The short stories are in a book.

01:49:18.852 --> 01:49:21.616
- A book?
- The novel's been published.

01:49:21.721 --> 01:49:25.851
- You mean you've published a book?
- Well done, Janet. Excellent!

01:49:25.959 --> 01:49:29.087
In fact, I've never met anybody
who's published a book before.

01:49:29.195 --> 01:49:31.857
Well, I mean, somebody like us.
That's great.

01:49:31.965 --> 01:49:34.593
Well, it's only in New Zealand.

01:49:34.701 --> 01:49:36.669
- Still, it's a book, Janet.
- Who's your publisher?

01:49:36.770 --> 01:49:39.637
Caxton Press for the short stories...

01:49:39.739 --> 01:49:42.037
and Pegasus for the novel.

01:49:43.777 --> 01:49:45.711
Well, I've chosen my publisher.

01:49:45.812 --> 01:49:48.406
Yes, we know, Paul. Faber.

01:49:48.515 --> 01:49:51.541
- Faber & Faber.
- To Faber & Faber.

01:50:03.597 --> 01:50:06.225
You didn't come home last night,Janet.

01:50:06.333 --> 01:50:09.302
No, I missed the bus.
It was too late.

01:50:10.837 --> 01:50:13.431
Come in. Come in.

01:50:19.479 --> 01:50:21.538
Where'd you stay?

01:50:21.648 --> 01:50:23.775
With some new friends.

01:50:25.385 --> 01:50:28.013
Who are these new friends?

01:50:28.121 --> 01:50:32.387
Writers and painters. Artists.

01:50:32.492 --> 01:50:35.620
That's not the type for you,Janet.

01:50:35.729 --> 01:50:38.630
They hang around and do no work.

01:50:38.732 --> 01:50:40.757
And what about their morals?

01:50:40.867 --> 01:50:44.325
All that... muckin' in together.

01:50:45.438 --> 01:50:47.429
I'm a writer too, Patrick.

01:50:48.775 --> 01:50:50.800
For the moment, maybe...

01:50:50.910 --> 01:50:53.879
but then when you come back
from Spain, we'll get you a real job.

01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:56.278
We'll look to our future then.

01:51:07.694 --> 01:51:09.662
This is for you.

01:52:06.419 --> 01:52:08.717
You can go to France with me.

01:52:12.492 --> 01:52:15.825
Ha ha, the wooing o'it

01:52:44.557 --> 01:52:47.890
My bags. My baggage.
It's not here.

01:52:54.567 --> 01:52:56.626
No, they're not here.

01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:09.948
Your bags are in Paris.
In Paris.

01:53:10.049 --> 01:53:14.383
The ticket for leaving bags is in Paris,
not for coming to Spain.

01:53:14.487 --> 01:53:17.081
You understand me?
Your bags are in Paris.

01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:49.020
Colin?

01:53:49.122 --> 01:53:52.319
Oh. Katie described your hair.

01:53:52.425 --> 01:53:55.394
- Where's your luggage?
- I'm traveling light.

01:53:55.495 --> 01:53:57.793
Oh, that's easy then. Come on.

01:54:18.284 --> 01:54:20.912
- Okay then. It's fixed up.
- Thank you.

01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:25.480
There's a room free. You said you wanted
to stay a couple of nights, yeah?

01:54:25.592 --> 01:54:28.390
Well, that's fine.
Okay. See you around.

01:54:31.965 --> 01:54:33.990
Thank you.

01:55:37.664 --> 01:55:41.600
"Thou who didst waken
from his summer dreams...

01:55:41.701 --> 01:55:45.262
"the blue Mediterranean
where he lay...

01:55:45.371 --> 01:55:47.601
"and saw in sleep...

"old palaces and towers...

01:55:51.344 --> 01:55:55.144
quivering within the wave's
intenser day."

01:56:38.024 --> 01:56:40.652
One day soon I would
walk around the harbor road...

01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:44.161
to the opposite shore,
where the real city lay...

01:56:44.263 --> 01:56:46.891
that I knew only
as the city in the sea.

01:57:09.389 --> 01:57:11.983
- Hello again.
- Musicians and motorbikes.

01:57:12.091 --> 01:57:14.059
Interesting combo.

01:57:17.130 --> 01:57:20.588
What was she like anyway?
Be a bit more careful, that's all.

01:57:24.070 --> 01:57:26.095
- Hello.
- Sarah.

01:57:26.205 --> 01:57:28.105
Hello.

01:57:30.076 --> 01:57:33.534
My luggage is coming.
They sent it by sea instead of rail.

01:57:40.853 --> 01:57:43.822
And, um, I found a place to stay.

01:57:45.324 --> 01:57:47.224
Good.

01:57:47.326 --> 01:57:51.285
Well, it has a view
of the water and the town.

01:57:52.331 --> 01:57:55.300
No, I mean the town and the water.

01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:03.068
Well, bye-bye.

01:58:03.176 --> 01:58:05.076
Oh! Hold on.

01:58:07.346 --> 01:58:11.373
That's the woman. Remember,
the one I met from the ferry the other day?

01:58:11.484 --> 01:58:14.544
- Without any luggage.
- Katie's friend or something.

01:58:14.654 --> 01:58:17.589
It's remarkable. I didn't think
there were people like that.

01:58:17.690 --> 01:58:20.250
She's very, very nervous.
Very nervous.

01:58:20.359 --> 01:58:22.520
How did Sarah look?

01:58:36.275 --> 01:58:38.937
Oh.

01:58:41.614 --> 01:58:43.582
Uh, carne. Carne.

01:58:44.717 --> 01:58:47.242
Uh -

01:58:47.353 --> 01:58:49.480
- Sн. Sн.

01:58:49.589 --> 01:58:51.489
Mmm.

01:58:55.328 --> 01:58:58.422
No, no.

01:58:58.531 --> 01:59:01.295
- No hombre.
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:59:06.839 --> 01:59:09.831
Oh! Yeah, my sister made me -
mi hermana.

01:59:09.942 --> 01:59:12.843
Made it from a curtain.
Uh, cortina.

01:59:19.252 --> 01:59:22.346
I was approved of because I was not a tourist.

01:59:22.455 --> 01:59:24.514
I was not American.

01:59:24.624 --> 01:59:27.252
I was an industrious escritora...

01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:29.828
who did not have foreign friends.

01:59:43.476 --> 01:59:45.376
A tree.

02:01:09.128 --> 02:01:13.258
I felt sick with disappointment
and a sense ofbetrayal...

02:01:13.366 --> 02:01:16.392
for I believed I had rented
the entire house.

02:01:16.502 --> 02:01:20.563
I had looked on Number 6
Ignacio Riquere as my place...

02:01:20.673 --> 02:01:23.642
not to be shared with a foreigner.
who spoke English.

02:01:25.011 --> 02:01:27.479
Where do you get your money changed, Janet?

02:01:27.580 --> 02:01:30.208
Oh, I changed it here when I arrived...

02:01:30.316 --> 02:01:32.284
at the bank.

02:01:32.385 --> 02:01:35.752
All of it?
You shouldn't have done that.

02:01:35.855 --> 02:01:39.256
I get my American scholarship money
changed in Andorra.

02:01:39.358 --> 02:01:41.883
There's where the cheap
money market is.

02:01:41.994 --> 02:01:44.360
"Cheap money"?

02:01:59.779 --> 02:02:01.747
A woman devil?

02:02:03.249 --> 02:02:05.581
She sleeps in his bed.

02:02:09.755 --> 02:02:12.519
Thank God you not like her.

02:02:27.473 --> 02:02:30.670
I longed to be
as full of secrets as she seemed to be...

02:02:30.776 --> 02:02:33.244
that would prompt a man
to discover them.

02:02:34.847 --> 02:02:38.214
But for so long, I had blocked
all exits and entrances...

02:02:38.317 --> 02:02:41.343
that I felt I was as sexless
as a block of wood.

02:02:43.889 --> 02:02:47.825
- Hi,Janet. These are my friends.

02:02:47.927 --> 02:02:49.827
Dora and Bernard.

02:02:49.929 --> 02:02:51.829
- Hello, Dora.
- Hi, Janet.

02:02:51.931 --> 02:02:54.900
- Hello, Bernard.
- It's Bernard's birthday.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:58.697
- Would you like to join us for a glass of wine?
- Oh, no, thank you, Edwin. I was just going.

02:02:58.804 --> 02:03:01.796
- Hey, I 'd like you to.
- Dora studies flute in Paris.

02:03:01.907 --> 02:03:06.105
- You been to Paris, Janet?
- Oh, just one night, really, on my way here.

02:03:06.212 --> 02:03:08.237
Oh, you need more
than a day in Paris.

02:03:08.347 --> 02:03:11.077
- Hey. W.B.
- To Bernard.

02:03:11.183 --> 02:03:14.311
- Thirty-fourth year to heaven.
- I don't think heaven's got much to do with it.

02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:16.718
What do you know about heaven, Edwin?
Huh? Huh?

02:03:16.822 --> 02:03:19.450
- Cincinnati last year, big guy.
- Don't talk Cincinnati.

02:03:19.558 --> 02:03:21.685
Oh,yeah?

02:03:25.131 --> 02:03:27.599
Hey, are you gonna show me your work?

02:03:27.700 --> 02:03:30.032
Oh,yeah, I've been working.

02:03:56.462 --> 02:03:58.362
-Janet.
- Oh!

02:03:58.464 --> 02:04:00.989
Hi. Good morning.

02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:04.092
- Hello.
- How are you?

02:04:04.203 --> 02:04:06.671
Good.

02:04:11.143 --> 02:04:13.077
Uh-huh!

02:04:15.114 --> 02:04:17.844
Byron.

02:04:17.950 --> 02:04:20.748
So, uh,you wanna go walking?

02:04:24.957 --> 02:04:28.324
I'll tell you one thing.
I could not work this morning.

02:04:31.464 --> 02:04:33.898
Um, what sort of work do you do?

02:04:33.999 --> 02:04:37.025
Well, back home I work
as a history professor...

02:04:37.136 --> 02:04:39.661
but I'm really a poet.

02:04:39.772 --> 02:04:41.672
A poet.

02:04:43.576 --> 02:04:47.012
Hey, come on. Edwin tells me
you're a published author.

02:04:48.147 --> 02:04:52.208
- But, ah, what about Auden?
- Oh, yes.

02:04:52.318 --> 02:04:55.412
"Follow, poet, follow right
to the bottom of the night."

02:04:55.521 --> 02:04:57.989
- Yeah. Right.
- "With your unconstraining voice...

02:04:58.090 --> 02:05:00.058
still persuade us to rejoice."

02:05:00.159 --> 02:05:02.491
Oh, and -
The Kipling.

02:05:02.595 --> 02:05:04.859
Kipling.
Do you know "Gunga Din"?

02:05:06.198 --> 02:05:08.189
What about Yeats?

02:05:08.300 --> 02:05:11.497
Yeah. But how does "Gunga Din" start?

02:05:11.604 --> 02:05:14.198
Now, I know that one. Uh -

02:05:40.566 --> 02:05:43.433
- I have to go.
- Yeah, I know.

02:05:43.536 --> 02:05:45.436
I know.

02:06:21.040 --> 02:06:23.008
Well, good morning.

02:06:25.177 --> 02:06:27.645
I brought some breakfast.

02:07:06.552 --> 02:07:08.520
Mmm. Uh -

02:07:09.622 --> 02:07:13.524
Just let me read you this first, okay?
Uh, I wrote it this morning.

02:07:13.626 --> 02:07:17.426
You know that time just after waking?
It's when I'm at my most creative.

02:07:18.464 --> 02:07:20.659
Now, it's just a first draft.

02:07:22.901 --> 02:07:27.338
"Spring."
"Spring in all its lightness.

02:07:27.439 --> 02:07:31.170
Glad brightness
of blue-domed day."

02:07:31.276 --> 02:07:33.744
I had "blue-roofed,"
but I changed it.

02:07:35.247 --> 02:07:37.147
"Blue-domed day.

02:07:37.249 --> 02:07:39.444
"Heart-holding hills of Ohio...

02:07:39.551 --> 02:07:43.317
"where memory stretches
like miles and s -

02:07:43.422 --> 02:07:46.880
spring renews its promise
like the first-spoken word."

02:07:48.227 --> 02:07:50.787
- Do you like it?
- Hmm.

02:07:52.698 --> 02:07:54.632
It must be lovely.

02:07:54.733 --> 02:07:56.701
Spring in Ohio.

02:08:04.543 --> 02:08:07.171
Blue-do -
Did you like blue-domed?

02:08:12.885 --> 02:08:16.946
-  Oh, beautiful!

02:08:17.056 --> 02:08:19.524
Do it again.

02:08:50.255 --> 02:08:53.816
Is the American rich?

02:08:53.926 --> 02:08:57.589
I don't know. Maybe.

02:09:08.474 --> 02:09:11.910
Bernard, I want to show you something
that Dora can do.

02:09:12.010 --> 02:09:14.638
She can kiss and play the stick game
at the same time.

02:09:14.747 --> 02:09:18.080
- Watch this.
- All right, all right.

02:09:18.183 --> 02:09:20.310
You think that is something?
You think that is something?

02:09:20.419 --> 02:09:22.387
- That's something.
- I want you to see something.

02:09:22.488 --> 02:09:25.355
My girl, who can play the Maori
stick game from New Zealand...

02:09:25.457 --> 02:09:28.756
can also drink wine and kiss
at the same time.

02:09:28.861 --> 02:09:33.059
- She can chug at the same time?
- Chug-a-lug.

02:09:33.165 --> 02:09:35.429
Chug, chug, chug.

02:09:35.534 --> 02:09:37.434
Look at that.
Now, that is the sort -

02:09:37.536 --> 02:09:39.504
You're always showing off, Bernard.
I'm sick of it.

02:09:39.605 --> 02:09:42.631
I'm always showing off?
Come on! En garde!

02:09:44.710 --> 02:09:46.678
- You always go too far!

02:09:46.779 --> 02:09:48.679
Someone get this guy off me.

02:10:08.333 --> 02:10:11.666
I haven't heard your typewriter for weeks.
You're not writing, are you?

02:10:14.106 --> 02:10:16.006
I'm taking a break.

02:10:17.476 --> 02:10:19.944
I hope you know what you're doing.

02:10:23.015 --> 02:10:25.142
- Of course I do.
- Okay.

02:11:17.069 --> 02:11:19.333
Well, I guess this is my last week.

02:11:24.209 --> 02:11:26.677
Oh, come on.
You knew I was going.

02:11:27.713 --> 02:11:29.772
No.

02:11:29.882 --> 02:11:33.579
Well, I have to get back,
prepare for next term and so on.

02:11:33.685 --> 02:11:36.677
God knows, I don't want to go.

02:11:36.788 --> 02:11:38.756
I didn't realize it was next week.

02:11:38.857 --> 02:11:43.294
Hey, listen. Look. No, no, no.
Listen to me.

02:11:45.264 --> 02:11:47.459
I've had a great summer.

02:11:48.901 --> 02:11:50.869
I really mean that.

02:11:52.404 --> 02:11:54.372
I'm gonna miss you.

02:11:56.375 --> 02:11:58.605
Huh?

02:11:58.710 --> 02:12:00.610
Hmm?

02:12:27.272 --> 02:12:30.730
Francesca.
Senorita Janetta - is she home?

02:12:37.549 --> 02:12:39.744
Look, I love you too.

02:12:46.391 --> 02:12:48.621
- Janet?

02:12:54.132 --> 02:12:56.760
-Janet? Are you there?

02:13:02.908 --> 02:13:05.240
Uh, the ferry goes at midday.

02:13:09.815 --> 02:13:11.715
Janet?

02:13:19.958 --> 02:13:22.426
I'd really like to say good-bye.

02:13:58.830 --> 02:14:01.230
Janetta?

02:14:08.907 --> 02:14:11.535
These Americans,
they spoil everything.

02:14:11.643 --> 02:14:17.343
Even the light they make dark.

02:14:53.685 --> 02:14:55.653
True romance, indeed.

02:14:55.754 --> 02:14:57.984
So much for poetry and music.

02:14:58.090 --> 02:15:01.218
I was beginning to suspect
that I might be pregnant.

02:15:03.562 --> 02:15:06.360
Here.

02:15:06.465 --> 02:15:09.491
Here. What you got in here?

02:15:12.170 --> 02:15:15.298
I managed to get you a room
in the main house...

02:15:15.407 --> 02:15:17.739
next to mine.

02:15:17.843 --> 02:15:20.311
Oh, we've got a new landlady.

02:15:20.412 --> 02:15:23.176
She's a real character.
Tip-top.

02:15:23.281 --> 02:15:25.249
She likes to be called Ma.

02:15:27.319 --> 02:15:29.378
By the way...

02:15:29.488 --> 02:15:31.956
I trust you're still fancy-free.

02:15:35.627 --> 02:15:37.822
Great. Come on then!

02:15:37.929 --> 02:15:40.022
I've got some tea on.

02:15:40.132 --> 02:15:43.101
It's the bus!
Janet! Where are you?

02:15:52.244 --> 02:15:54.838
You don't want to spend
your time writing.

02:15:56.915 --> 02:15:58.883
There's no money in it.

02:16:02.654 --> 02:16:05.054
It's all right for a holiday...

02:16:05.157 --> 02:16:07.717
but nothin' else.

02:16:07.826 --> 02:16:09.794
Not for permanent.

02:16:16.301 --> 02:16:18.792
What about Peek Freans?

02:16:20.739 --> 02:16:23.299
- Peek Freans?
- Yeah!

02:16:23.408 --> 02:16:26.206
You could work in the office there.

02:16:27.412 --> 02:16:29.312
Yeah!

02:17:17.662 --> 02:17:20.290
Although I had not wanted the baby...

02:17:20.397 --> 02:17:23.959
I had sometimes imagined
a boy with Bernard's laugh...

02:17:24.068 --> 02:17:26.434
or a girl with his eyes.

02:17:29.608 --> 02:17:32.906
So nice to have a mature applicant.

02:17:33.011 --> 02:17:35.478
We have so many young ones.

02:17:38.650 --> 02:17:40.674
Any major illnesses?

02:17:40.785 --> 02:17:42.684
No.

02:17:42.787 --> 02:17:46.587
- Uh, any operations?
- No.

02:17:46.691 --> 02:17:49.455
- Psychiatric treatment?
- Yes.

02:17:51.129 --> 02:17:53.995
I spent some time in hospital
in New Zealand.

02:17:54.099 --> 02:17:56.431
How long is "some time"?

02:17:58.403 --> 02:18:00.303
Eight years.

02:18:00.405 --> 02:18:03.532
How could you possibly think
of being a nurse?

02:18:06.477 --> 02:18:08.446
What was the diagnosis?

02:18:13.885 --> 02:18:16.752
- Schizophrenia.
- I'm sorry.

02:18:16.855 --> 02:18:19.483
No.

02:18:19.591 --> 02:18:22.321
It's out of the question.

02:19:01.665 --> 02:19:04.294
I felt as if all the griefs I had ever known...

02:19:04.402 --> 02:19:07.303
were beginning to surface within me.

02:19:15.980 --> 02:19:18.574
In fear and despair for my life...

02:19:18.683 --> 02:19:23.643
I needed answers to the questions
I still asked myself about my history.

02:19:23.754 --> 02:19:28.215
I knew that talk ofsuicide
must always be taken seriously.

02:19:28.325 --> 02:19:32.592
Such talk came readily to me
as a shortcut to ensure action.

02:19:38.202 --> 02:19:40.831
I was admitted
as a voluntary patient.

02:20:23.248 --> 02:20:27.207
Finally it was concluded that I had
never suffered from schizophrenia.

02:20:28.253 --> 02:20:31.279
At first the tr.uth seemed
mor.e ter.r.ifying than the lie.

02:20:32.657 --> 02:20:36.286
How could I now ask for help
when there was nothing wrong with me?

02:20:39.230 --> 02:20:41.596
You know the problems
you've been experiencing...

02:20:41.699 --> 02:20:44.691
are a direct result
of all those years in hospital.

02:20:44.803 --> 02:20:47.271
You can't undo that quickly.

02:20:47.372 --> 02:20:49.772
I'm here whenever you need me...

02:20:49.874 --> 02:20:54.038
but, I think for a start,
once a week.

02:20:54.145 --> 02:20:56.045
Once a week. All right.

02:20:56.147 --> 02:21:01.346
Mmm. And I want you to write about
your time spent in hospital in New Zealand.

02:21:01.453 --> 02:21:05.719
It'll help give you
a clearer view to the future.

02:21:05.824 --> 02:21:08.987
- But I have to find a job.
- Don't have to worry about that.

02:21:09.093 --> 02:21:11.618
You'll get National Assistance.

02:21:11.729 --> 02:21:14.857
If anyone tells you to get out and mix...

02:21:14.966 --> 02:21:17.298
and you don't want to...

02:21:17.402 --> 02:21:19.302
don't.

02:22:37.248 --> 02:22:40.615
- Have you read it?
- Yes, I have.

02:22:40.718 --> 02:22:44.381
And I'm sure that getting that time
out of your system will be good for you.

02:22:46.424 --> 02:22:49.985
But as a book, do you like it?

02:22:50.094 --> 02:22:53.063
I told you, I 'm not a literary chap.

02:22:54.265 --> 02:22:56.495
Have you thought of getting an agent?

02:22:56.601 --> 02:22:59.092
- I already have one.
- What did he say?

02:22:59.203 --> 02:23:03.003
- I wanted you to read it first.
- That's good.

02:23:04.275 --> 02:23:07.733
Now I have, take it to him,
get his opinion.

02:23:58.529 --> 02:24:01.327
I'm going to meet
my publisher tomorrow.

02:24:01.432 --> 02:24:05.232
Ooh! Why don't I make
a hair appointment for you?

02:24:05.336 --> 02:24:08.703
Oh, no. Nothing works. I've tried.

02:24:12.844 --> 02:24:15.312
I'm sure they could
do something with it.

02:24:30.628 --> 02:24:33.859
Granted, your books
have had good reviews.

02:24:33.965 --> 02:24:35.990
Some very good.

02:24:36.100 --> 02:24:39.729
But what I want you to do now
is write a best seller.

02:24:42.106 --> 02:24:46.202
When Wanda Lyons comes to see me,
do you know how she comes?

02:24:46.310 --> 02:24:48.778
She comes in a Rolls-Royce.

02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:51.508
You are a better writer
than Wanda.

02:24:53.751 --> 02:24:55.651
Best seller.

02:24:55.753 --> 02:24:57.721
Best seller.

02:24:57.822 --> 02:25:00.290
Study them.
They'll give you the form.

02:25:01.793 --> 02:25:04.261
- Where is it you're living?
- Camberwell.

02:25:04.362 --> 02:25:07.388
Camberwell is a wasteland.

02:25:07.498 --> 02:25:11.093
I'll make you an offer.
I'll give you an apartment.

02:25:11.202 --> 02:25:13.796
Give me?

02:25:13.905 --> 02:25:16.635
Yes, I'd like you to write
your next book in there.

02:25:19.977 --> 02:25:23.913
Uh - I don't know.
I'll have to see.

02:25:24.015 --> 02:25:28.111
Also, I've got some people
who'd like to meet you.

02:25:29.954 --> 02:25:31.854
And don't forget.

02:25:31.956 --> 02:25:34.652
Next time you come
in a Rolls-Royce.

02:26:05.156 --> 02:26:08.284
There. These should fit you as well.

02:26:08.392 --> 02:26:11.190
Lovely. Now, I'll send Columba
for your wet things.

02:26:11.295 --> 02:26:15.061
Oh, I loved your last book.
It was just absolutely marvelous.

02:26:15.166 --> 02:26:17.464
- Take your time.
- Thank you.

02:26:36.921 --> 02:26:39.389
- You enjoyed the book then?
- Oh,yes.

02:26:39.490 --> 02:26:42.323
She's an interesting new author..

02:26:42.426 --> 02:26:45.486
Probably won't sell.
It probably won't be a best seller..

02:26:45.596 --> 02:26:47.928
We won't lose anything on it.

02:26:48.032 --> 02:26:50.899
Janet Frame,
Alan and Ruth Sillitoe.

02:26:51.002 --> 02:26:53.027
- Pleased to meet you at last.
- I 'll get you a drink.

02:26:53.137 --> 02:26:55.105
- Hello.
-Janet, welcome.

02:26:55.206 --> 02:26:58.175
Janet, do make yourself comfortable.
Sit down, please.

02:27:01.179 --> 02:27:03.443
I loved your Faces in the Water..

02:27:03.548 --> 02:27:05.948
It's powerful stuff.
Very true.

02:27:08.085 --> 02:27:09.985
Thank you.

02:27:11.889 --> 02:27:15.188
I, um - I enjoyed your book too.

02:27:15.293 --> 02:27:17.386
The Loneliness
of the Long-Distance Runner..

02:27:19.197 --> 02:27:21.097
I 'm glad.

02:27:23.234 --> 02:27:25.259
Here you are,Janet.

02:27:25.369 --> 02:27:27.269
Thank you.

02:27:31.876 --> 02:27:36.472
Janet's in our Knightsbridge
apartment at the moment...

02:27:36.581 --> 02:27:38.811
writing her new book.

02:27:38.916 --> 02:27:40.816
Yes.

02:27:49.060 --> 02:27:50.960
I am.

02:28:12.416 --> 02:28:14.543
Dear Janet...

02:28:14.652 --> 02:28:17.678
I wish there was a way
to break this news more gently.

02:28:19.090 --> 02:28:21.422
Dad is dead.

02:28:21.525 --> 02:28:26.155
He was cycling to work on the North Road
when he collapsed and died later in hospital.

02:28:27.932 --> 02:28:32.562
Poor Dad. He hasn 't properly
cared for himself since Mum died.

02:28:32.670 --> 02:28:35.366
Bruddie says the house
is a rubbish heap.

02:31:15.433 --> 02:31:17.333
Miss Frame?

02:31:19.203 --> 02:31:22.297
Ken Bowker
from the local paper, Miss Frame.

02:31:22.406 --> 02:31:24.374
Can we come up?

02:31:27.845 --> 02:31:29.745
Yes.

02:31:47.131 --> 02:31:51.033
Sorry to disturb you.
We wanted to beat the Dunedin papers to it.

02:31:53.637 --> 02:31:56.231
- To what?
- Your story.

02:31:58.476 --> 02:32:00.603
Can you bend your knees?

02:32:07.885 --> 02:32:10.183
Can we have one sitting,
Miss Frame?

02:32:10.287 --> 02:32:12.187
Sitting.

02:32:15.893 --> 02:32:19.420
Um - Like this?

02:32:21.165 --> 02:32:23.497
That's good.

02:32:34.678 --> 02:32:37.374
Come on, baby

02:32:37.481 --> 02:32:39.972
Let's do the twist

02:32:41.018 --> 02:32:43.816
Come on, baby

02:32:43.921 --> 02:32:46.116
Let's do the twist

02:32:46.223 --> 02:32:49.249
- Pamela, come to bed, please?
- Take me by my little hand

02:32:50.427 --> 02:32:53.157
And go like this

02:32:53.264 --> 02:32:55.755
- Coffee?
- Uh, no thanks,June.

02:32:56.800 --> 02:32:58.700
- See you tomorrow then.
- Night-night.

02:32:58.802 --> 02:33:03.501
- Night-night.
- Ooh, yeah

02:33:03.607 --> 02:33:06.041
Just like this

02:33:06.143 --> 02:33:08.839
Come on, little girl

02:33:09.880 --> 02:33:11.848
And do the twist

02:33:13.050 --> 02:33:16.042
My daddy is sleepin'

02:33:16.153 --> 02:33:18.781
And my mama ain't around

02:33:18.889 --> 02:33:22.256
Yes, Daddy's just sleepin'

02:33:22.359 --> 02:33:24.293
And Mama ain't around

02:33:31.802 --> 02:33:34.828
Yeah, now twist

02:33:34.939 --> 02:33:38.397
Girl, baby, twist

02:33:38.509 --> 02:33:42.036
Ooh, yeah

02:33:42.146 --> 02:33:45.240
Just like this

02:33:45.349 --> 02:33:48.079
Come on, little miss

02:33:48.185 --> 02:33:50.176
And do the twist

02:34:06.503 --> 02:34:09.404
Hush, hush, hush.

02:34:10.808 --> 02:34:13.641
The grass and the wind...

02:34:13.744 --> 02:34:15.644
and the fir...

02:34:15.746 --> 02:34:17.873
and the sea are saying...

02:34:19.049 --> 02:34:20.983
hush...

02:34:21.085 --> 02:34:23.645
hush...

02:34:23.754 --> 02:34:25.654
hush.
