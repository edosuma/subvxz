WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:03.594
Voyager to Shuttlecraft Drake.

00:03.670 --> 00:05.797
Prepare for emergency transport.

00:05.872 --> 00:07.362
Mr. Kim, can you hear me?

00:07.440 --> 00:09.135
We're attempting
to lock on to you.

00:11.011 --> 00:11.978
Harry?

00:12.045 --> 00:13.012
Harry.

00:15.081 --> 00:17.140
Hey, it's time to wake up.

00:21.221 --> 00:22.415
What's wrong?

00:25.058 --> 00:27.288
Libby...

00:27.360 --> 00:28.793
Yes?

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:32.218 --> 02:34.516
This can't be happening.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.919
What's wrong with you?

02:42.428 --> 02:45.829
Libby, it's really you,
isn't it?

02:47.133 --> 02:49.693
Come on.
You're going to be late.

02:49.769 --> 02:51.236
What?

02:51.304 --> 02:54.467
You have a meeting--
0900, remember?

02:54.541 --> 02:56.668
You've only been obsessing
about it for a week.

02:56.743 --> 02:58.472
l don't want Lieutenant Lasca
blaming me

02:58.545 --> 02:59.773
because you weren't on time

02:59.846 --> 03:01.245
for the biggest meeting
of your career.

03:01.314 --> 03:04.147
Now, get dressed and l'll
make you some breakfast.

03:11.424 --> 03:13.016
Come on.
The eggs are getting cold.

03:15.562 --> 03:17.496
What's with you today?

03:18.698 --> 03:19.926
The date.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.466
What's the date?

03:21.534 --> 03:22.728
The date?

03:22.802 --> 03:24.565
What day is today?

03:24.637 --> 03:26.332
4901 1.

03:26.406 --> 03:29.500
So this isn't the past,
it's the present.

03:31.311 --> 03:33.711
San Francisco.

03:35.148 --> 03:37.173
This can't be a dream.

03:37.250 --> 03:39.115
lt's too... real.

03:39.185 --> 03:40.880
lt's too clear.

03:42.088 --> 03:43.988
So what does that leave?

03:44.057 --> 03:46.617
A holodeck?

03:46.693 --> 03:48.092
A hallucination?

03:48.161 --> 03:49.856
Some kind of trick?

03:49.929 --> 03:52.762
The last thing l remember
was piloting

03:52.832 --> 03:55.392
a shuttlecraft
on my way back to Voyager.

03:55.468 --> 03:57.333
We both have a long day
ahead of us.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.871
Could we play this little game
another time, please?

03:59.939 --> 04:01.839
No...

04:01.941 --> 04:04.705
you can't be Libby.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.803
lt's not possible.

04:09.182 --> 04:11.582
My name is Ensign Harry Kim

04:11.651 --> 04:14.119
of the Federation
Starship Voyager.

04:14.187 --> 04:15.245
Where am l?

04:15.321 --> 04:16.481
ls this some sort of simulation?

04:16.555 --> 04:19.889
That's not funny, Harry,
talking about Voyager like that.

04:19.959 --> 04:23.053
The memorial service
was only two months ago.

04:23.129 --> 04:24.391
Danny was your best friend.

04:24.464 --> 04:25.795
How could you joke about it?

04:25.865 --> 04:29.665
Danny... Danny Byrd?

04:29.736 --> 04:32.830
l'm done with this conversation.

04:32.905 --> 04:34.167
Go to work.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.673
l'll see you tonight.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.242
What is going on?

05:20.586 --> 05:21.575
Harry!

05:24.791 --> 05:26.281
Coming right up.

05:34.300 --> 05:35.597
Here you go.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.636
Vulcan mocha, extra sweet.

05:37.704 --> 05:38.762
Thanks.

05:38.838 --> 05:40.499
So, today's the big day, huh?

05:40.573 --> 05:41.870
What do you mean?

05:41.941 --> 05:43.374
You know, the meeting.

05:43.443 --> 05:45.468
The new ship you're designing.

05:45.545 --> 05:48.070
And don't forget, you promised
to bring me a model--

05:48.147 --> 05:50.479
and l'm going to hang it
right there in my window,

05:50.550 --> 05:51.482
and l'll tell everyone:

05:51.551 --> 05:52.916
''Harry Kim,
he designed that ship.

05:52.985 --> 05:56.079
He came into my shop
every morning.''

05:56.155 --> 05:58.817
Look, l know this is going
to sound a little funny,

05:58.891 --> 06:01.485
but how long have l been
coming to this coffee shop?

06:01.561 --> 06:02.653
How long?

06:02.729 --> 06:03.661
Well, let's see.

06:03.730 --> 06:04.662
Since you left the Academy.

06:04.731 --> 06:06.221
How long is that?
Eight... eight months.

06:06.299 --> 06:08.062
-Eight months?
-Mm-hmm.

06:08.134 --> 06:10.329
And you've seen me every day?

06:10.403 --> 06:12.064
Well...

06:12.138 --> 06:13.298
not every day.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.533
You like to sleep late
on Sunday.

06:14.607 --> 06:17.440
But if l had your fiancée,
l'd sleep late, too.

06:17.510 --> 06:18.772
Fiancée?!

06:18.845 --> 06:20.210
We're getting married?

06:20.279 --> 06:21.837
Ah, yes.

06:21.914 --> 06:23.040
There were
many mornings l woke up,

06:23.116 --> 06:26.210
l said the same thing to myself
when l was about to be married.

06:26.285 --> 06:28.344
But don't worry, it'll pass.

06:28.421 --> 06:31.652
l don't think you've ever had
a morning quite like this one.

06:32.792 --> 06:34.555
Hey, Harry! You ready to go?

06:34.627 --> 06:36.720
Um... where?

06:36.796 --> 06:38.229
Very funny. Come on.

06:38.297 --> 06:40.492
We better get moving
if we're going to catch

06:40.566 --> 06:41.658
the transport to Headquarters.

06:41.734 --> 06:43.929
l... l'm not sure l can go.

06:44.003 --> 06:45.163
l'm not feeling very well.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.535
Maybe l should just go home.

06:46.606 --> 06:48.665
Come on, come on.

06:48.741 --> 06:49.935
lt's just a case of the jitters.

06:50.009 --> 06:51.533
You'll do just fine.

07:12.999 --> 07:14.762
Relax, Harry.

07:14.834 --> 07:18.497
lf all goes well, you'll walk
out of this room a Lieutenant.

07:18.571 --> 07:20.732
Let me see
that warp coil schematic.

07:20.807 --> 07:22.798
The what?

07:22.875 --> 07:24.843
The coil diagram...

07:24.911 --> 07:28.506
the one with the new
plasma flow equations.

07:28.581 --> 07:30.276
l forgot to bring it.

07:30.349 --> 07:31.611
Forgot?

07:31.684 --> 07:33.914
Harry, we need
that diagram to show

07:33.986 --> 07:37.114
that we've worked out
the dilithium fracture problem.

07:37.190 --> 07:39.385
l'm sorry.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.519
Well, we'll just
have to improvise.

07:42.595 --> 07:44.563
Good morning.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.393
l have a meeting at 1 100 hours

07:46.466 --> 07:48.058
with the head
of Starfleet Security.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.227
She doesn't like
to be kept waiting.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.066
Let's get this underway.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.571
Lieutenant Lasca?

07:53.639 --> 07:55.004
Thank you, Admiral.

07:59.779 --> 08:00.837
Ladies and gentlemen,

08:00.947 --> 08:03.177
you are looking
at the new Runabout Yellowstone.

08:03.216 --> 08:06.117
lt's equipped with
tetryon plasma warp nacelles

08:06.185 --> 08:09.052
and designed for a variety
of mission profiles.

08:09.121 --> 08:10.986
Yes, Lieutenant, l've looked
over your specifications.

08:11.057 --> 08:14.288
lt's an interesting design...

08:14.360 --> 08:15.759
but how do you propose
to address

08:15.828 --> 08:18.558
the dilithium fracture problem?

08:18.631 --> 08:20.565
Tetryon plasma
tends to disrupt subspace.

08:20.633 --> 08:23.466
l'm actually glad you
asked that question, sir.

08:23.536 --> 08:24.503
We've been working

08:24.570 --> 08:25.867
on the problem
for several weeks,

08:25.938 --> 08:27.769
and l think you'll see
that we have found an answer.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.070
l'd like to introduce
you to the engineer

08:30.142 --> 08:32.076
who designed
these new warp engines.

08:32.144 --> 08:34.908
And, l might add, he is the most
promising young engineer

08:35.014 --> 08:38.211
to come out of the Academy
in a long time.

08:38.284 --> 08:39.615
Ensign Harry Kim.

08:52.031 --> 08:53.555
Harry.

08:53.633 --> 08:56.295
ls there a problem, Ensign?

08:57.670 --> 08:59.763
Actually, sir, there is.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.402
Come on, Harry,
pull it together.

09:06.479 --> 09:09.346
We've been waiting for this
for six months.

09:09.415 --> 09:10.643
Ensign, are you ill?

09:13.085 --> 09:14.279
Yes, sir.

09:14.353 --> 09:16.412
l'm very ill.

09:16.489 --> 09:18.548
l would like to...

09:18.624 --> 09:21.525
continue this presentation
at a later date.

09:21.594 --> 09:23.357
Well, unfortunately, Ensign,

09:23.429 --> 09:24.691
l'm leaving
for a three-week tour

09:24.764 --> 09:26.732
of the Cardassian border
in a few days.

09:26.799 --> 09:29.165
lt will have to wait
until after then.

09:32.838 --> 09:35.773
Harry... you better be dying.

10:05.738 --> 10:07.899
Guess l'm pretty good.

10:22.254 --> 10:24.017
Computer, display
my service record.

10:25.891 --> 10:29.759

any temporal anomalies

in the space-time continuum
reported in the last 48 hours?

11:04.130 --> 11:05.222
Negative.

11:05.297 --> 11:08.323
No temporal anomalies
have been reported.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.266

has there been any contact
with the Starship Voyager

11:13.005 --> 11:15.132
since it was lost
in the Badlands?

11:15.207 --> 11:18.370
lnformation on USS Voyager
is classified.

11:18.444 --> 11:21.174
Security clearance level three

11:23.749 --> 11:25.239

11:25.317 --> 11:27.842
lt's my ship,
or at least l thought it was.

11:29.989 --> 11:32.856

Last recorded contact
with USS Voyager

11:34.760 --> 11:36.557

Danny.

12:08.994 --> 12:10.518
Harry!

12:10.596 --> 12:12.791
What are you doing
back so early?

12:12.865 --> 12:14.298
Oh... hi.

12:14.366 --> 12:17.062
l wasn't feeling too well,
so l decided to come home.

12:17.136 --> 12:18.603
Oh? You don't look sick to me.

12:18.671 --> 12:21.196
Coming home for a little visit
with Libby, are we?

12:21.273 --> 12:22.399
Ah, to be young.

12:22.475 --> 12:24.443
Don't worry.
l'll keep your secret.

12:24.510 --> 12:25.636
Thanks.

12:25.711 --> 12:27.975
Listen, l know this is going
to sound strange,

12:28.047 --> 12:30.538
but l forgot to look
at the street number

12:30.616 --> 12:31.981
when l left this morning

12:32.084 --> 12:33.745
and l don't remember
which building l live in.

12:33.819 --> 12:34.979
Could you...

12:35.054 --> 12:36.385
Tell you where you live?

12:37.990 --> 12:39.890
You're not playing
some kind of a prank

12:39.959 --> 12:41.722
on your old pal Cosimo, are you?

12:41.794 --> 12:43.489
No. Like l said...

12:43.562 --> 12:45.928
l haven't been feeling well
and...

12:45.998 --> 12:47.863
everything's kind of foggy.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.195
Okay, okay, okay.

12:49.268 --> 12:50.462
Well, you live
right over there--

12:50.536 --> 12:53.096
fourth floor, apartment 4-G.

12:53.172 --> 12:55.003
Thanks.

12:55.074 --> 12:56.507
Harry...

12:56.575 --> 12:58.372
don't look so concerned.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.173
Everything's going to work out.

13:00.246 --> 13:02.771
You have a wonderful job,
a beautiful fiancée.

13:02.848 --> 13:04.611
Everything is going to be fine.

13:04.683 --> 13:05.775
Trust me.

13:05.851 --> 13:07.045
Hmm?

13:21.534 --> 13:23.525
Hello? Who's there?

13:25.204 --> 13:27.104
lt's just me, Libby.

13:27.173 --> 13:28.572
Harry?

13:30.075 --> 13:31.804
Are you okay?

13:33.379 --> 13:34.971
Yeah.

13:35.047 --> 13:36.674
l'm fine.

13:36.749 --> 13:38.182
You feel a little warm.

13:40.052 --> 13:42.714
God, you're tense.

13:42.788 --> 13:45.586
Why don't you tell me
what happened today.

13:47.593 --> 13:49.220
Nothing.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.325
Everything.

13:55.167 --> 13:57.362
l'm not sure what happened.

13:59.038 --> 14:00.232
Harry...

14:00.306 --> 14:02.171
forget about work.

14:02.241 --> 14:03.572
Try to relax.

14:03.642 --> 14:05.303
You're home now.

14:06.645 --> 14:08.636
What can l do to help?

14:11.383 --> 14:13.817
Just...

14:13.886 --> 14:15.615
tell me you love me.

14:17.489 --> 14:19.286
l tell you that every day.

14:19.358 --> 14:21.622
Aren't you getting
sick of hearing it?

14:21.694 --> 14:23.821
No.

14:23.896 --> 14:25.329
ln fact...

14:26.999 --> 14:29.467
...pretend l haven't
heard you say it

14:29.535 --> 14:31.162
in a long time.

14:32.872 --> 14:36.364
Pretend that we haven't
seen each other for months.

14:36.442 --> 14:37.773
Okay.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.848
l love you, Harry.

14:42.915 --> 14:44.815
Welcome home.

14:47.052 --> 14:49.520
So...

14:49.588 --> 14:52.557
if we haven't seen
each other for months...

14:52.625 --> 14:54.718
where have you been?

14:55.861 --> 14:57.761
Oh...

14:57.830 --> 14:59.593
on a starship,

14:59.665 --> 15:01.792
thousands of light years away.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.300
A mission?

15:03.335 --> 15:04.632
Yeah.

15:06.105 --> 15:07.663
We got a little lost.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.367
Aw.

15:09.441 --> 15:10.999
Sounds lonely.

15:13.145 --> 15:15.443
You can't imagine.

15:15.514 --> 15:17.345
Tell me something...

15:17.416 --> 15:19.281
Hmm?

15:19.351 --> 15:24.721
You didn't stop at Risa
along the way, did you?

15:24.790 --> 15:26.553
No...

15:26.625 --> 15:30.652
no pleasure planet
excursions, l'm afraid.

15:30.729 --> 15:35.792
You thought about me
the whole time.

15:35.868 --> 15:37.335
Every day.

15:39.204 --> 15:41.172
Every nanosecond.

15:42.708 --> 15:44.835
Do me a favor.

15:44.910 --> 15:47.401
Hmm?

15:47.479 --> 15:50.004
Don't ever leave me again.

17:43.829 --> 17:47.458
''Orlando, Parsons, Peterson,
Platt, Porter...''

17:48.534 --> 17:50.297
Wait a minute-- Paris.

17:50.369 --> 17:52.894
Where's Tom Paris?

17:52.971 --> 17:55.030
Computer, access service record

17:55.107 --> 17:57.974
of Starfleet officer
Thomas Eugene Paris.

17:59.478 --> 18:00.775
''Convicted of treason.

18:00.879 --> 18:02.312
''Sentenced to 18 months

18:02.347 --> 18:04.542
''at the New Zealand
penal settlement.

18:04.616 --> 18:08.552
''Paroled on Stardate 48702.

18:08.620 --> 18:12.454
Last reported whereabouts:
Marseilles, France.''

18:12.524 --> 18:14.185
Harry?

18:14.259 --> 18:16.056
lt's 4:00 in the morning.

18:16.128 --> 18:17.527
What are you doing?

18:17.596 --> 18:19.291
Oh, l couldn't sleep,

18:19.364 --> 18:22.731
so l thought l'd
catch up on some work.

18:22.801 --> 18:26.259
When are you going to tell me
what's going on?

18:26.338 --> 18:29.637
There's nothing going on, okay?

18:29.708 --> 18:32.176
You're not a very good liar,
Harry.

18:32.244 --> 18:34.906
You've been acting strange
all day

18:34.980 --> 18:37.676
and l'm not the only one
who's worried about you.

18:37.749 --> 18:39.910
Lieutenant Lasca called
this afternoon.

18:39.985 --> 18:42.215
He said he's never seen you
so agitated.

18:42.287 --> 18:46.053
So don't tell me
there's nothing going on.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.218
Libby...

18:48.293 --> 18:51.490
it's hard to explain right now,

18:51.563 --> 18:55.829
and l do want to tell you,
but l need you to trust me.

18:55.901 --> 18:57.630
l do trust you.

18:57.703 --> 18:59.227
l love you.

18:59.304 --> 19:01.033
That's why l'm marrying you.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.802
l would hope you would
have the same trust in me.

19:06.678 --> 19:07.838
All right.

19:07.946 --> 19:09.675
This...

19:09.748 --> 19:12.012
this is going to sound
a little crazy

19:12.084 --> 19:13.483
from your perspective,

19:13.552 --> 19:15.577
but l am not who you think l am.

19:15.654 --> 19:17.588
Oh?

19:17.656 --> 19:19.180
All of this--

19:19.258 --> 19:21.852
it's not supposed
to be happening.

19:21.927 --> 19:23.690
l don't belong here.

19:26.398 --> 19:28.059
lf you're having
second thoughts

19:28.133 --> 19:31.227
about getting married,
why didn't you just say so?

19:31.303 --> 19:32.770
You don't understand.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.772
What l'm trying to say is...

19:36.308 --> 19:38.333
l'm from another reality.

19:38.410 --> 19:41.538
Another reality.

19:41.613 --> 19:44.173
That's right.

19:44.249 --> 19:46.717
Harry, you're starting
to scare me.

19:46.785 --> 19:47.843
l know.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.080
l'm scared, too.

19:49.154 --> 19:51.088
Maybe you should talk
to a Counselor,

19:51.156 --> 19:52.384
a neurologist.

19:52.457 --> 19:54.584
There may be something
wrong with you.

19:54.660 --> 19:55.922
l will.

19:55.994 --> 19:58.462
But there's someone else
l need to see first.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.020
Where are you going?

20:00.098 --> 20:01.725
Marseilles, France.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.392
What for?

20:03.468 --> 20:04.901
l've got to see Paris.

20:04.970 --> 20:06.528
But you just said...

20:06.605 --> 20:09.096
you were going to Marseilles.

20:09.174 --> 20:10.835
lt's a long story.

20:13.812 --> 20:15.177
Trust me.

20:15.247 --> 20:16.612
Okay?

20:18.684 --> 20:20.049
Okay.

20:47.646 --> 20:50.945
Hey, watch it, will you?

20:51.016 --> 20:53.348
l'm trying to set up
a shot here.

20:53.418 --> 20:55.010
Tom.

20:56.388 --> 20:58.185
Who the hell are you?

21:04.062 --> 21:05.927
You don't know me, do you?

21:05.998 --> 21:08.865
Sure. We were at the Academy
together, right?

21:08.934 --> 21:10.367
No.

21:10.435 --> 21:13.598
Oh. Well, it must
have been the Exeter.

21:13.672 --> 21:16.368
We served on
the Exeter together?

21:16.441 --> 21:18.238
Try Voyager.

21:18.310 --> 21:21.711
Ah... Voyager.

21:23.382 --> 21:27.113
Well, sorry to disappoint
you, but...

21:29.221 --> 21:31.917
...l never set foot
on that ship.

21:33.158 --> 21:36.616
And l can't say that l'm sorry,
considering what happened to it.

21:38.163 --> 21:39.653
You know about the mission
to the Badlands?

21:39.731 --> 21:41.323
Oh, yeah.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.425
Captain Janeway asked

21:43.502 --> 21:46.369
if l'd help her track
down that Maquis ship

21:46.438 --> 21:50.101
in exchange for an early release
from the penal colony.

21:50.175 --> 21:51.642
But you said no?

21:51.710 --> 21:53.041
Are you kidding?

21:53.111 --> 21:54.578
l said yes.

21:54.646 --> 21:57.547
Sounded better
than Starfleet Rehab.

21:59.551 --> 22:02.111
Anyway, l got as far

22:02.220 --> 22:06.884
as Deep Space Nine, where l got
into a bar fight with a Ferengi

22:06.925 --> 22:08.916
and l was thrown into the brig

22:08.994 --> 22:11.258
by a very unpleasant
shape-shifter.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.491
Janeway tried
to get me released,

22:13.565 --> 22:16.830
but my parole was revoked
by Starfleet Command.

22:19.604 --> 22:21.799
Voyager left without me.

22:25.544 --> 22:30.572
That Ferengi, was he trying
to sell you Lobi crystals?

22:32.918 --> 22:34.180
Yeah.

22:36.822 --> 22:37.880
How do you know about that?

22:37.956 --> 22:40.447
Because l was there--

22:40.525 --> 22:42.390
in my reality anyway.

22:42.461 --> 22:46.329
Tom, l know this
is going to sound crazy,

22:46.398 --> 22:49.333
but l was on Voyager,
and so were you.

22:49.401 --> 22:51.995
You never got into a bar fight
with that Ferengi.

22:52.137 --> 22:54.605
You stopped him
from selling me Lobi crystals,

22:54.673 --> 22:56.698
and you did lead us
into the Badlands.

22:56.775 --> 22:59.243
You're right.
That does sound crazy.

22:59.311 --> 23:01.643
Something's happened.

23:01.747 --> 23:05.444
Somehow, reality
has been changed--

23:05.484 --> 23:07.475
a temporal anomaly,
an alien influence--

23:07.552 --> 23:08.746
l can't explain how.

23:08.820 --> 23:10.913
All l know is that it's true.

23:11.022 --> 23:14.924
l was in a shuttlecraft,
heading back to Voyager

23:15.026 --> 23:18.553
and then...
l woke up here, on Earth.

23:22.467 --> 23:25.027
What is it you want?

23:25.103 --> 23:27.594
Come with me
to Starfleet Headquarters.

23:27.672 --> 23:29.731
Help me run
a computer simulation

23:29.808 --> 23:31.901
of what happened
on that shuttle.

23:31.977 --> 23:34.309
You're the best pilot
l've ever seen,

23:34.379 --> 23:37.109
and if anyone
can figure it out, it's you.

23:42.621 --> 23:44.145
God...

23:44.222 --> 23:47.749
you... you had me
there for a minute.

23:47.826 --> 23:51.318
You really did,
but then you blew it.

23:51.396 --> 23:52.829
What are you talking about?

23:52.898 --> 23:54.297
You're not getting me

23:54.366 --> 23:56.766
to set foot inside
Starfleet Headquarters.

23:56.835 --> 23:59.668
So you tell whatever Admiral
or Captain who sent you

23:59.738 --> 24:01.171
that l'm not interested

24:01.273 --> 24:03.741
in being another pawn
in one of their games.

24:03.775 --> 24:04.833
lt's not a game!

24:04.910 --> 24:06.434
Oh, it isn't?

24:06.511 --> 24:08.911
Oh, that's a shame.

24:09.014 --> 24:10.845
l like games.

24:12.984 --> 24:14.076
You once told me

24:14.152 --> 24:16.746
that you used to treat life
like one big game:

24:16.822 --> 24:18.915
rules, players...

24:18.990 --> 24:21.481
winners, losers.

24:21.560 --> 24:23.460
You never took
any of it seriously,

24:23.528 --> 24:25.120
until you lost.

24:25.197 --> 24:29.531
You know, you're starting
to annoy me.

24:29.601 --> 24:31.933
You also told me you were afraid
of what would happen to you

24:32.070 --> 24:34.732
if you didn't take
Captain Janeway up on her offer.

24:36.875 --> 24:39.070
Now l see why.

24:39.144 --> 24:41.977
What do you see...

24:42.047 --> 24:44.174
Ensign?

24:45.684 --> 24:49.176
A loser...

24:49.254 --> 24:50.846
and a drunk.

24:56.495 --> 25:00.022
l guess, in this reality,

25:00.098 --> 25:02.066
that's all you'll ever be.

25:34.032 --> 25:36.398
What's going on?

25:36.468 --> 25:38.299
Harry, just relax.

25:38.370 --> 25:39.462
Why does everyone say ''relax''

25:39.538 --> 25:41.369
when they're about to do
something terrible?

25:41.439 --> 25:43.907
Starfleet knows
what you've been doing.

25:43.975 --> 25:45.670
Which is what, exactly?

25:45.744 --> 25:47.541
Breaking into classified files,

25:47.612 --> 25:49.637
using forged
security access codes.

25:49.714 --> 25:51.978
l haven't forged anything.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.984
And l can explain.

25:54.052 --> 25:55.485
That's why we're here.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.988
We're going to take you
back to Starfleet Headquarters.

25:58.056 --> 26:00.786
They want to ask you
a few questions.

26:00.859 --> 26:02.850
Harry, please--
just go with them.

26:02.961 --> 26:04.792
Tell them what you told me.

26:04.863 --> 26:08.094
Everything will be all right.

26:08.166 --> 26:11.101
l don't think l have a choice
at the moment.

26:11.169 --> 26:13.660
l'll see you later.

26:24.449 --> 26:26.747
You claim to have Voyager
security protocols

26:26.818 --> 26:28.809
because you were an officer
on Voyager.

26:28.887 --> 26:30.115
Yes, sir.

26:30.188 --> 26:32.247
Lost in the Delta Quadrant.

26:32.324 --> 26:34.189
Yes, sir.

26:34.259 --> 26:36.090
And Ensign Daniel Byrd--

26:36.161 --> 26:39.187
you say that he's taken
your place on that ship?

26:39.264 --> 26:40.822
Yes, sir.

26:42.701 --> 26:45.101
And this is all because...

26:45.170 --> 26:48.105
reality
has been changed somehow?

26:48.173 --> 26:50.971
Yes, sir.

26:51.042 --> 26:53.237
But you don't have
a single shred of evidence

26:53.311 --> 26:54.903
to back up your claims.

26:57.749 --> 27:01.116
Harry...

27:01.186 --> 27:02.244
l don't doubt for a minute

27:02.320 --> 27:04.345
that you believe
you're telling the truth,

27:04.422 --> 27:06.117
but we have to consider
all the possibilities.

27:06.191 --> 27:08.091
Like what?

27:08.159 --> 27:09.990
Like you could be delusional,

27:10.061 --> 27:12.859
or you could've had
your memory centers altered,

27:12.964 --> 27:16.024
so that you think what you're
saying is the truth,

27:16.101 --> 27:19.229
or you could be an alien
masquerading as Harry Kim.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.499
That's crazy.

27:21.573 --> 27:24.167
l am Harry Kim.

27:24.242 --> 27:25.709
Check my DNA
if you don't believe me.

27:25.777 --> 27:27.904
Run a microcellular scan

27:28.013 --> 27:30.413
of my cerebral cortex to see
if my memory's been altered.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.643
Everything l'm saying is true.

27:32.717 --> 27:34.912
Mr. Kim, why did you travel

27:34.986 --> 27:37.113
to Marseilles, France,
this morning?

27:41.159 --> 27:44.925
l... went to look up
an old friend.

27:44.996 --> 27:46.930
You have poor taste in friends.

27:46.998 --> 27:48.260
Thomas Paris is

27:48.333 --> 27:51.268
a convicted traitor
and a Maquis sympathizer.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.861
Now, what did you
talk about with him?

27:53.938 --> 27:56.771
l tried to tell him
what's happened.

27:56.841 --> 27:58.638
l wanted his help.

27:58.710 --> 28:02.202
His help--
to run a shuttle simulation.

28:02.313 --> 28:05.874
Why?

28:05.917 --> 28:08.215
To figure out how l got here,

28:08.286 --> 28:10.049
and how l can get back.

28:10.121 --> 28:13.318
There must be a temporal anomaly
somewhere, or...

28:15.360 --> 28:18.090
You think l'm a spy, don't you?

28:18.163 --> 28:20.757
You think l'm working
for the Maquis.

28:20.832 --> 28:23.027
We're here to find the truth,
Ensign,

28:23.101 --> 28:24.568
whatever that might be.

28:24.636 --> 28:25.830
That's it.

28:25.904 --> 28:28.031
l'm not answering
any more questions

28:28.106 --> 28:29.767
until l have legal counsel.

28:29.841 --> 28:31.365
You have that right.

28:31.443 --> 28:34.844
Harry, we want to help you,
but try to understand.

28:34.913 --> 28:38.713
What you are telling us
doesn't make much sense.

28:38.783 --> 28:40.080
All we know, so far,

28:40.151 --> 28:42.051
is that you have been seen
talking with a Maquis criminal

28:42.120 --> 28:46.147
and you've broken into
classified Starfleet records.

28:46.224 --> 28:49.557
Until there is something else--
something concrete--

28:49.627 --> 28:51.595
those are the facts
in this case,

28:51.663 --> 28:55.429
and you have to admit
the facts look pretty bad.

28:58.903 --> 29:01.064
We will be monitoring
your movements

29:01.172 --> 29:02.571
until further notice.

29:02.607 --> 29:04.074
l believe you know
the restrictions--

29:04.142 --> 29:05.973
no off-world travel--

29:06.044 --> 29:07.170
and if you tamper
with the anklet,

29:07.245 --> 29:08.940
Security will be
immediately alerted,

29:09.013 --> 29:11.504
and you will be
formally charged.

29:11.583 --> 29:12.982
Do you understand?

29:15.487 --> 29:17.318
Yes, Admiral.

29:21.059 --> 29:23.118
We'll be spending a lot
of time together, Ensign,

29:23.194 --> 29:27.062
and l assure you, we will
get to the bottom of this.

29:27.132 --> 29:28.190
You're dismissed.

30:04.202 --> 30:06.193
Troubles, Harry?

30:07.572 --> 30:09.164
You could say that.

30:09.240 --> 30:11.208
Let's have some coffee.

30:14.212 --> 30:15.975
l was sent here to watch you--

30:16.047 --> 30:18.208
to make sure
that you were all right.

30:18.283 --> 30:20.615
But now it's clear
that you are not.

30:20.685 --> 30:22.516
Who are you?

30:22.587 --> 30:24.987
We exist in what you would call

30:25.056 --> 30:28.924
a temporal inversion fold
in the space-time matrix.

30:28.993 --> 30:30.927
lt's not necessary
to understand.

30:30.995 --> 30:33.759
lt only matters
that there was an accident.

30:33.832 --> 30:36.995
Your shuttle intersected
one of our time-streams

30:37.101 --> 30:38.568
and... boom!

30:38.636 --> 30:42.037
A few things were altered
as the result of the accident.

30:42.140 --> 30:44.608
History and events
were scrambled a bit

30:44.676 --> 30:46.439
and you ended up here.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.979
Well, you've got to get me back.

30:49.047 --> 30:50.776
Ah...

30:50.849 --> 30:52.783
we don't know how.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.375
What?

30:54.452 --> 30:57.216
We only know
that an accident occurred.

30:57.288 --> 30:59.313
We don't know how or why.

30:59.390 --> 31:01.153
Well, that's not good enough.

31:01.259 --> 31:03.523
There's got to be
something we can do.

31:03.561 --> 31:05.495
Where is this time-stream
of yours?

31:05.563 --> 31:07.724
Maybe l can use it to get back.

31:07.799 --> 31:08.925
Mm...

31:09.000 --> 31:12.492
the time-stream weaves through
the galaxy like a thread.

31:12.570 --> 31:14.936
l could show you how to find it,
and you could try to recreate

31:15.039 --> 31:17.507
the conditions that existed
before the accident

31:17.575 --> 31:19.941
and fly back into it,
but there's no guarantee

31:20.011 --> 31:21.774
what will happen to you
if you do.

31:21.846 --> 31:22.813
What do you mean?

31:22.881 --> 31:25.907
Well, you may be able
to change reality again,

31:25.984 --> 31:29.476
but there's no way to predict
how it would change.

31:29.554 --> 31:32.489
You could end up at any point
in the space-time continuum.

31:32.557 --> 31:34.991
You might return
to your original reality,

31:35.059 --> 31:38.586
or you might find yourself
a billion years in the future,

31:38.663 --> 31:40.563
or at some time
before sentient life

31:40.632 --> 31:42.759
even existed on your planet.

31:42.834 --> 31:45.325
l guess l'll have
to take that chance

31:45.403 --> 31:49.339
because somehow
l have to get back.

31:50.575 --> 31:53.043
Are you so sure?

31:53.111 --> 31:55.272
This is a pretty good
place for you, Harry.

31:55.346 --> 31:57.337
You have a wonderful
job with Starfleet,

31:57.415 --> 31:59.383
a beautiful woman who loves you.

31:59.450 --> 32:03.113
Why be so quick
to turn your back on all this?

32:03.221 --> 32:06.156
Maybe this is your, uh... fate?

32:06.190 --> 32:08.055
lsn't that the word
your people use?

32:08.126 --> 32:09.923
That thing
which was meant to be?

32:09.994 --> 32:11.154
Hmm?

32:11.229 --> 32:14.687
Seems to me you're actually
a very lucky man.

32:18.036 --> 32:20.334
What about Danny Byrd?

32:20.405 --> 32:22.168
He isn't so lucky.

32:22.240 --> 32:24.834
And Tom Paris?

32:24.909 --> 32:28.709
Fate wasn't so kind to him.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.213
No.

32:30.281 --> 32:32.545
lt isn't supposed
to be this way.

32:32.617 --> 32:36.417
l'm supposed to be on Voyager
in the Delta Quadrant,

32:36.487 --> 32:39.115
and that's where l have to go.

32:42.927 --> 32:44.918
Very well.

32:47.031 --> 32:49.499
This will tell you
where the time-stream

32:49.567 --> 32:51.558
intersects this region of space.

32:51.636 --> 32:54.196
That's as much
as l can do for you.

32:56.074 --> 32:57.132
Thanks.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.310
Good luck,
Harry Kim of Voyager.

33:02.413 --> 33:04.278
You're going to need it.

33:04.315 --> 33:06.476
Unless, of course,
you decide to stay.

33:06.551 --> 33:10.817
ln which case, l'll see you
in the morning, same time--

33:10.888 --> 33:13.823
Vulcan mocha, extra sweet.

33:35.913 --> 33:36.880
Libby...

33:36.948 --> 33:38.882
l didn't hear you come in.

33:38.950 --> 33:39.882
Obviously.

33:39.951 --> 33:41.384
You're in enough trouble
as it is.

33:41.452 --> 33:43.977
What do you want them to do,
put you in prison?

33:44.055 --> 33:46.683
No...

33:46.758 --> 33:48.350
l'm just trying to get back
to where l belong.

33:48.426 --> 33:51.486
Where you belong.

33:51.562 --> 33:54.531
You used to say
you belonged here with me.

33:56.267 --> 33:58.201
But l guess everything's
changed, hasn't it?

33:58.269 --> 34:00.169
Look...

34:03.608 --> 34:04.734
l know the last few days

34:04.809 --> 34:06.071
must've been
pretty tough on you...

34:06.144 --> 34:07.236
Do you?!

34:07.311 --> 34:09.643
Do you really know
what it's like

34:09.714 --> 34:12.080
when the person you love
suddenly changes?

34:12.150 --> 34:14.777
lt's still me-- the guy who was

34:14.851 --> 34:18.413
in your seat
at the Ktarian music festival.

34:18.489 --> 34:20.650
The guy who took three weeks

34:20.725 --> 34:22.920
to work up the courage
to ask you out.

34:23.027 --> 34:26.656
The guy who still wakes up
in the middle of the night

34:26.731 --> 34:30.326
and says your name out loud,
hoping you'll answer back.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.869
But if you're really Harry,

34:32.937 --> 34:36.373
you wouldn't be trying so hard
to get away from me.

34:36.440 --> 34:38.568
l'm not trying
to get away from you.

34:38.643 --> 34:40.975
l love you.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.978
And l promise you

34:43.081 --> 34:46.482
l want to stay here
more than anything.

34:47.851 --> 34:50.150
But l can't.

34:50.221 --> 34:52.485
l don't understand.

34:52.556 --> 34:54.855
l don't understand any of this.

34:58.096 --> 35:01.930
l don't think anybody knows me
as well as you do.

35:03.334 --> 35:04.961
So you, of all people,
should know

35:05.036 --> 35:06.970
that once l've made up
my mind about something,

35:07.038 --> 35:09.006
l can't let it go.

35:11.175 --> 35:13.075
ln some ways...

35:13.144 --> 35:15.476
it'd be a lot easier
to forget about Voyager,

35:15.546 --> 35:19.642
just settle in here
and build a life...

35:19.717 --> 35:22.811
but that wouldn't be me.

35:22.887 --> 35:24.821
You wouldn't be
getting the Harry Kim

35:24.889 --> 35:26.857
you fell in love with.

35:31.863 --> 35:33.831
Does that make any sense?

35:35.600 --> 35:37.227
The tampering alarm.

35:37.301 --> 35:39.326
Security will be here
any second.

35:39.403 --> 35:41.496
l better go.

35:41.572 --> 35:45.030
l promise you, l'm going
to try to get back.

35:45.109 --> 35:46.736
lt may take awhile,

35:46.811 --> 35:52.010
and l may not make it,
but l swear l will try.

36:02.627 --> 36:04.618
Sorry.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.119
Hold it!

37:00.117 --> 37:01.379
Get up!

37:02.720 --> 37:03.709
Excuse me.

37:05.957 --> 37:07.788
There goes my bank shot.

37:07.858 --> 37:09.052
What are you doing here?

37:09.126 --> 37:10.855
Helping out a friend.

37:10.962 --> 37:12.953
Let's go.

37:21.606 --> 37:22.868
So how did you find me?

37:22.974 --> 37:24.635
l still have a few friends
at Starfleet.

37:24.709 --> 37:26.506
They told me you were
in some serious trouble.

37:26.577 --> 37:29.375
Yeah. Starfleet thinks
l'm a Maquis spy.

37:29.447 --> 37:30.641
l know the feeling.

37:30.715 --> 37:33.445
Those security anklets
really chafe, don't they?

37:33.517 --> 37:36.111
You're the last person
l expected to help me.

37:36.187 --> 37:38.087
Let's just say
it's been a long time

37:38.155 --> 37:41.852
since anybody gave a damn
about my future, including me.

37:41.926 --> 37:42.858
l don't know if l'm supposed

37:42.927 --> 37:44.861
to be on Voyager
like you've told me,

37:44.929 --> 37:47.454
but it sounds a whole lot better
than the life l have here.

37:47.531 --> 37:50.022
l'm willing to take
my chances, Ensign.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.659
Call me Harry.

37:51.736 --> 37:53.431
You always did.

37:53.504 --> 37:55.665
Won't be long
before they find us.

37:55.740 --> 37:57.230
We better keep moving.

37:57.308 --> 37:59.799
Wait, l found a way
to get back to my reality.

37:59.877 --> 38:01.435
The problem is
l'll need a ship to do it.

38:01.545 --> 38:03.513
l think l have access
to a runabout,

38:03.547 --> 38:05.947
but l'm going to have
to break it out of Spacedock.

38:06.017 --> 38:08.178
Sounds to me
like you need a pilot.

38:08.252 --> 38:10.083
Know anyone who's qualified?

38:10.154 --> 38:12.247
l know someone
who used to be pretty good,

38:12.323 --> 38:14.188
and if l'm not mistaken,
he still knows a few tricks.

38:14.258 --> 38:16.123
l have an office
at Starfleet Headquarters.

38:16.193 --> 38:17.125
l think we can access

38:17.194 --> 38:18.525
the runabout launch codes
from there.

38:18.596 --> 38:20.359
Site-to-site transporter.

38:20.431 --> 38:21.455
With friends like mine,

38:21.532 --> 38:23.329
you never know when
it'll come in handy.

38:23.401 --> 38:24.493
Where's your office?

38:24.568 --> 38:27.696
Main complex, Level 6,
Subsection 47.

38:27.772 --> 38:30.832
l can beam us in, but we'll
only have a few minutes

38:30.908 --> 38:32.876
before Security starts
kicking down the door.

38:32.977 --> 38:34.205
Let's do it.

38:40.551 --> 38:43.452
So, Harry, once we're
on board the runabout,

38:43.521 --> 38:44.681
what's the plan?

38:44.755 --> 38:46.017
The alien said
that if l recreate

38:46.090 --> 38:48.183
the conditions of the accident
and fly into the time-stream,

38:48.259 --> 38:50.750
there's a chance l might be able
to get back into my reality.

38:50.828 --> 38:52.159
Might?

38:52.229 --> 38:53.355
He couldn't give
me any guarantees.

38:54.732 --> 38:55.721
Security's just been alerted

38:55.800 --> 38:58.098
to an unauthorized transport
in the building.

38:58.169 --> 38:59.295
lt'll take them
another 20 seconds

38:59.370 --> 39:00.234
to track it to this office.

39:00.338 --> 39:01.270
How are you coming?

39:01.305 --> 39:02.329
Almost there.

39:02.406 --> 39:05.204
l've bypassed the runabout
security lock-outs.

39:05.276 --> 39:06.436
They're onto us.

39:06.510 --> 39:07.568
We've got to go.

39:07.645 --> 39:08.839
Hold on.
l've almost got it.

39:09.780 --> 39:10.747
Now!

39:18.656 --> 39:20.487
Overriding initialization codes.

39:20.558 --> 39:22.355
Main power coming on line.

39:22.426 --> 39:24.519
Let's get those engines going.

39:24.595 --> 39:26.756
Powering up main fusion reactor.

39:26.831 --> 39:27.991
lntruder alert.

39:28.065 --> 39:30.499
Unauthorized launch in progress.

39:30.568 --> 39:32.832
The space door is closing.

39:32.903 --> 39:35.667
Warp core and main
propulsion are on line.

39:35.740 --> 39:38.436
Releasing docking clamps,
moorings cleared.

39:38.509 --> 39:40.067
Here we go.

39:47.985 --> 39:49.850
We're clear.

39:49.920 --> 39:51.581
l'm entering the coordinates

39:51.655 --> 39:54.215
of the time-stream
into the main computer.

39:54.291 --> 39:58.057
Adjusting course to match.
Going to full impulse.

39:58.129 --> 40:00.791
We've got a starship on
our tail-- Nebula-class.

40:00.865 --> 40:02.696
l'll try to lose them, Harry,

40:02.767 --> 40:05.201
but they're a lot faster
than we are.

40:05.269 --> 40:07.362
Attention Runabout Yellowstone.

40:07.438 --> 40:10.339
Power down your engines
or we will open fire.

40:10.408 --> 40:11.375
They're going to try

40:11.442 --> 40:12.670
to do everything
they can to stop us.

40:12.743 --> 40:15.177
They think we're trying
to steal this prototype.

40:16.213 --> 40:18.204
They're closing
to 5,000 kilometers.

40:23.988 --> 40:25.819
Shields down to 70 percent!

40:26.924 --> 40:28.858
50 percent!

40:28.926 --> 40:30.188
29 percent!

40:30.261 --> 40:32.456
l thought you said this ship
was new and improved!

40:32.530 --> 40:33.929
lt is.

40:33.998 --> 40:35.522
But it looks like they
haven't finished working

40:35.599 --> 40:36.588
on the defensive systems.

40:36.667 --> 40:38.191
ln fact, some
of the safety interlocks

40:38.269 --> 40:39.258
aren't even in place.

40:39.336 --> 40:41.201
A few more of those hits
and l don't...

40:42.239 --> 40:44.002
We're losing
antimatter containment.

40:44.108 --> 40:45.837
Attempting
to stabilize the field.

40:45.910 --> 40:48.743
We're approaching the
coordinates of the time-stream.

40:50.748 --> 40:51.908
The containment field
is weakening.

40:51.982 --> 40:53.506
We could be looking
at a core breach.

40:53.584 --> 40:56.678
The ship's closing
to 3,000 kilometers.

40:56.754 --> 40:58.187
lf we can't shake them off,

40:58.255 --> 40:59.847
maybe we can slow
them down a little.

40:59.924 --> 41:00.913
This runabout is equipped

41:01.025 --> 41:02.458
with tetryon plasma
warp nacelles.

41:02.493 --> 41:03.460
So?

41:03.527 --> 41:06.496
Tetryon plasma emits
multiflux gamma radiation.

41:06.564 --> 41:07.792
lt disrupts subspace.

41:07.865 --> 41:09.526
We could vent the warp plasma.

41:09.600 --> 41:11.659
The second they hit
the plasma cloud,

41:11.735 --> 41:12.929
their engines would stall,

41:13.003 --> 41:14.470
give us a few seconds
of breathing room.

41:14.538 --> 41:15.664
Exactly.

41:15.739 --> 41:17.798
Unlocking the warp drive
manifold.

41:17.875 --> 41:19.934
Venting drive plasma.

41:25.749 --> 41:27.376
Any second...

41:29.687 --> 41:31.655
They've dropped
to one-tenth impulse.

41:34.758 --> 41:36.589
Our containment field's
at critical.

41:36.660 --> 41:37.649
We'd better hurry.

41:37.728 --> 41:40.424
All right, let's recreate
my shuttle accident.

41:40.498 --> 41:43.296
l think l was traveling
at 140,000 kph.

41:43.367 --> 41:44.493
You think?

41:44.568 --> 41:45.626
Look, that was another lifetime.

41:45.703 --> 41:47.102
l'm doing the best l can.

41:47.171 --> 41:50.834
lncreasing speed to 140,000 kph.

41:50.908 --> 41:53.376
Now, l also remember
running a polaron scan.

41:53.444 --> 41:55.776
The scanning beam
was sweeping at a radius

41:55.846 --> 41:57.575
of half a million kilometers.

41:57.648 --> 41:59.582
No, wait...
a quarter million.

42:02.052 --> 42:04.452
Activating polaron scan.

42:04.522 --> 42:06.251
That should do it.

42:06.323 --> 42:07.654
Approaching coordinates.

42:07.725 --> 42:09.454
lmpact in four...

42:09.527 --> 42:10.653
three...

42:10.728 --> 42:11.854
two...

42:14.498 --> 42:15.795
Did we miss it?

42:15.866 --> 42:17.800
We passed through
the coordinates,

42:17.868 --> 42:19.495
but the runabout was unaffected.

42:20.704 --> 42:22.331
The starship
has repowered its engines.

42:22.406 --> 42:24.340
They'll be here
in under a minute.

42:24.408 --> 42:26.569
l have to get
into that time-stream.

42:26.644 --> 42:27.975
Wait a minute.

42:28.045 --> 42:30.445
l'm forgetting something.

42:30.514 --> 42:31.811
The emergency transport.

42:31.882 --> 42:33.645
The last thing
l remember hearing

42:33.717 --> 42:35.480
was Captain Janeway's
com voice.

42:35.553 --> 42:37.851
She said she was trying
to beam me off the shuttle.

42:37.922 --> 42:40.152
That's it. l've got
to beam off the ship.

42:40.224 --> 42:41.521
Are you crazy?

42:41.592 --> 42:42.889
We have to recreate
all the conditions

42:42.960 --> 42:44.723
of the accident,
including that one.

42:44.795 --> 42:46.854
We just lost
antimatter containment.

42:46.931 --> 42:48.421
25 seconds to core breach.

42:48.499 --> 42:50.262
l've locked
onto the time-stream.

42:50.334 --> 42:51.892
Get on the transporter pad.

42:51.969 --> 42:53.163
Not yet.
The core's breaching.

42:53.237 --> 42:54.670
We've got to shut it down first.

42:54.738 --> 42:55.670
There's no time!

42:55.739 --> 42:57.206
That ship'll be here
in another 30 seconds!

42:57.274 --> 42:59.367
ln 15 seconds, this ship
is going to explode.

42:59.443 --> 43:00.341
You'll be killed.

43:00.444 --> 43:02.002
Look! lf you're right,
then things will be

43:02.046 --> 43:03.911
changed back to the way
they're supposed to be,

43:03.981 --> 43:05.608
and you'll find me
back on Voyager.

43:05.683 --> 43:07.583
And if l'm wrong,
if this doesn't work,

43:07.651 --> 43:09.141
you'll be blown up right here.

43:12.022 --> 43:13.353
Go!

43:18.429 --> 43:19.794
Voyager to Shuttlecraft Drake.

43:19.863 --> 43:22.229
Prepare for emergency transport.

43:22.299 --> 43:23.425
Mr. Kim, can you hear me?

43:23.500 --> 43:25.593
We're attempting
to lock onto you.

43:25.669 --> 43:26.761
Harry?

43:26.837 --> 43:27.929
Kim here, Captain.

43:28.005 --> 43:29.836
Harry, we need you
to drop your shields.

43:29.907 --> 43:32.068
Stand by.

43:32.142 --> 43:33.769
Shields down, Captain.

43:33.844 --> 43:35.175
Lieutenant.

43:35.245 --> 43:38.180
The anomaly is sending out
heavy subspace distortions.

43:38.248 --> 43:39.476
l can't get
a positive lock on him.

43:39.550 --> 43:41.245
The hull is starting
to buckle under the stress.

43:41.318 --> 43:42.808
He won't survive much longer.

43:42.886 --> 43:45.116
Tuvok, can you boost
the transporter signal?

43:45.189 --> 43:46.850
Negative. The signal
is at maximum gain.

43:46.924 --> 43:48.414
Ten seconds to hull breach.

43:48.492 --> 43:50.551
He's just out of reach.

43:50.628 --> 43:51.856
B'Elanna, can you
tie the transporter

43:51.929 --> 43:53.226
directly into the main
deflector dish.

43:53.297 --> 43:55.356
Use it to extend the signal.

43:55.432 --> 43:56.524
l'll try.

43:56.600 --> 43:57.965
Hull breach in progress.

44:00.070 --> 44:01.196
We've got him, Captain.

44:01.271 --> 44:03.603
Mr. Chakotay,
analyze the sensor logs.

44:03.674 --> 44:05.608
l want to know
what happened out there.

44:05.676 --> 44:06.768
Aye, Captain.

44:06.844 --> 44:08.778
Voyager to Transporter Room 2.

44:08.846 --> 44:10.279
Are you all right, Mr. Kim?

44:10.347 --> 44:11.609
l think so, Captain.

44:11.682 --> 44:13.115
ls Lieutenant Paris there?

44:13.183 --> 44:15.378
Yes, he's here.
Why?

44:15.452 --> 44:16.919
lt's a long story.

44:16.987 --> 44:18.887
l look forward to hearing it.

44:18.956 --> 44:20.890
l'll be in my ready room.

44:26.430 --> 44:27.795
We think your shuttlecraft

44:27.865 --> 44:30.390
was caught in some kind
of temporal anomaly.

44:30.467 --> 44:31.525
A time-stream?

44:31.602 --> 44:33.331
Yes, you could call it that.

44:33.404 --> 44:36.032
l've already been briefed,
Commander.

44:36.106 --> 44:37.368
Welcome back.

44:37.441 --> 44:39.705
Kind of a rough ride, huh?

44:42.046 --> 44:43.877
What is it, Harry?

44:43.947 --> 44:45.881
l owe you one.
