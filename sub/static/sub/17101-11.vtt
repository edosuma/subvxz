03:49.297 --> 03:50.931
I SHOULDN'T
BE IN HERE.

03:51.031 --> 03:53.133
I SHOULD'VE NEVER
COME IN HERE.

03:53.233 --> 03:57.204
YOU WERE BONE-TIRED, YOU WERE
BABBLING ABOUT THEM DREAMS.

03:57.305 --> 04:01.208
THING JUST HAPPENED.

04:01.309 --> 04:02.710
IT'S A SIN.

04:02.810 --> 04:06.013
NOBODY TELLS ME
WHAT TO DO IN MY BED.

04:06.113 --> 04:07.781

DRESSES TO LILA FOR MENDIN' ?

04:54.828 --> 04:56.997
( laughing )

04:57.097 --> 04:58.966
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.769
MMM.

05:04.705 --> 05:07.007
WHAT ?

05:10.544 --> 05:12.546
HOW'D THAT
GET IN THERE ?

05:12.646 --> 05:15.248
NO.

05:15.349 --> 05:18.786
THAT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE IN THERE.

05:18.886 --> 05:22.390
IT'S MEZCAL.

05:22.490 --> 05:26.226
MEXICANS SAY...

05:26.326 --> 05:28.862
YOU SWALLOW
THAT LITTLE FELLA,

05:28.962 --> 05:32.833

MAGIC POWERS.

GOT MAGIC POWERS.

05:38.205 --> 05:39.673
NO.

05:39.773 --> 05:40.874

05:40.974 --> 05:43.110
IT'S MAMA.

05:43.210 --> 05:46.414
HER MAGIC
AIN'T SO GREAT.

05:46.514 --> 05:49.383
NEVER SEEN HER
BE WRONG.

05:49.483 --> 05:53.921
WHAT SHE SEES
IN THE CARDS IS TRUE.

05:55.723 --> 05:58.125
SHE SAID WE WERE
GONNA GET OUT OF HERE.

05:58.225 --> 06:01.629
SHE WAS WRONG
ABOUT THAT ONE.

06:01.729 --> 06:05.566
YEAH.

06:12.339 --> 06:14.007
YOU KNOW WHO
YOU REMIND ME OF ?

06:14.107 --> 06:17.110
KATHARINE HEPBURN.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.046
YOU'RE CRAZY.

06:19.146 --> 06:21.281
NO, I'M SERIOUS.

06:21.381 --> 06:25.218
LIKE IN "MORNING GLORY".

06:25.318 --> 06:29.623
SHE'S SO STRONG...

06:31.291 --> 06:33.126

06:33.226 --> 06:36.163
I DON'T WANNA SAY
STRANGE-LOOKIN'.

06:36.263 --> 06:37.731
OH, THANKS.

06:37.831 --> 06:40.133
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEANT AT ALL.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.870
WHAT, EXOTIC ?

06:42.970 --> 06:44.137
UM-HMM.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.907
HYPNOTIC.

07:22.209 --> 07:25.979
COME ON,
TAKE THE LAST SIP.

07:31.585 --> 07:34.955
I THINK
I'M GONNA BE SICK.

07:45.966 --> 07:49.069
( music )

07:55.776 --> 07:59.880
YOU HERE FOR
THE FIESTA, SEÃ±OR ?

07:59.980 --> 08:01.281
FIESTA ?

08:01.381 --> 08:02.482
SI.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.484
DIA DE LOS MUERTOS.

08:04.585 --> 08:07.588
UN GRANDE CELEBRACIÃ³N.

08:07.688 --> 08:10.991
WHAT'RE
THEY CELEBRATIN' ?

08:11.091 --> 08:13.326
THE RETURN
OF THE SOULS.

08:13.426 --> 08:18.732
TO LA MUERTE.

08:21.802 --> 08:24.872
WE RAISE
OUR GLASS TO HER.

08:32.112 --> 08:34.181
DOES SHE SCARE YOU ?

08:34.281 --> 08:37.985
I SEEN PEOPLE DIE.

08:56.469 --> 08:58.906
( panting )

09:04.244 --> 09:07.080
( crowd shouting )

09:22.495 --> 09:24.231
NO.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.133
I AIN'T
GOT NO MONEY.

09:28.101 --> 09:28.969
NO...

09:29.069 --> 09:32.572
NO, NO DINERO.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.877
TELL THEM I DON'T
HAVE ANYTHING !

09:36.977 --> 09:37.845
THEY KNOW.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.613
THEN WHAT'S
WRONG WITH THEM ?

09:39.713 --> 09:41.481
ES LA LLORANDO.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.917
THEY ARE WEEPING.

09:46.319 --> 09:48.188
WHY ?

09:48.288 --> 09:50.991
FOR YOUR LOSS.

09:55.629 --> 09:57.998
( Spanish )

10:02.169 --> 10:05.305
PAN DE MUERTO.

10:05.405 --> 10:09.977
EVEN THE DEAD
MUST EAT.

11:02.395 --> 11:06.433
( low whispers )

11:51.779 --> 11:54.214
KNEEL, MY SON.

12:03.190 --> 12:06.326
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN
SINCE YOUR LAST CONFESSION ?

12:08.862 --> 12:11.932
I NEVER DONE
THIS BEFORE.

12:12.032 --> 12:15.402
DO YOU WISH TO CONFESS YOUR SINS
THAT THEY MAY BE FORGIVEN ?

12:15.502 --> 12:17.404
BY YOU ?

12:17.504 --> 12:21.741
IN THE EYES
OF THE LORD.

12:27.781 --> 12:32.252
HE, HE CAN'T
MAKE IT RIGHT.

12:36.489 --> 12:41.294
I KILLED A MAN.

12:41.394 --> 12:44.464
YES.

12:44.564 --> 12:49.236
AND I DONE IMPURE THINGS WITH
A WOMAN I WASN'T MARRIED TOO.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.407
I LIED.

12:54.507 --> 12:57.978
I STOLE.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.284
GO ON.

13:17.664 --> 13:22.035
I LET HER DIE.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.171
YOUR MOTHER
CHOSE TO DIE.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.517
WHO ARE YOU ?

13:57.137 --> 14:00.840
LAST SUNDAY,
I SAW SOMETHING.

14:00.941 --> 14:04.544
SOMETHING I CAN'T EXPLAIN
IN ANY RATIONAL WAY.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.313
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

14:06.413 --> 14:09.816
WHEN I MADE THE SIGN OF
THE CROSS ON HIS FOREHEAD...

14:09.917 --> 14:13.853
THE HOLY WATER
TURNED TO BLOOD.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.923
BLOOD ?

14:16.023 --> 14:17.357
OH I'M SURE
YOU'RE MISTAKEN.

14:17.457 --> 14:21.261
I'M AN OLD MAN, IRIS,
BUT I'M NOT A FOOL.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.163
I KNOW WHAT I SAW.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.098
I'M SURE IT WAS
JUST THE LIGHT.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.499
OR MAYBE
YOU WERE TIRED.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.435
IT'S TIME
TO FACE FACTS,

14:28.535 --> 14:31.704
PERHAPS, HE'S COME UNDER
THE INFLUENCE OF SOMETHING.

14:31.804 --> 14:33.773
SOMETHING DANGEROUS.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.576
I KNOW HE'S
A MAN OF GOD.

14:36.676 --> 14:38.711
I RAISED HIM
IN THE CHURCH.

14:38.811 --> 14:40.580
BOTH OF YOU.

14:40.680 --> 14:43.316
IRIS.

14:43.416 --> 14:46.686
THE BIBLE SPEAKS OF DEMONS
THAT CAN ENTER A PERSON.

14:46.786 --> 14:48.621
DEMONS ?

14:48.721 --> 14:49.856
THERE ARE RITUALS--

14:49.957 --> 14:51.224
CATHOLIC RITUALS, YES.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.560
YOU'RE SPEAKING
OF AN EXORCISM ?

14:53.660 --> 14:54.861
THAT'S INSANE.

14:54.962 --> 14:57.530
YOU KNOW IT'S JUST
PAPIST HOCUS POCUS.

14:57.630 --> 14:58.932
IT MAY BE
THE ONLY WAY--

14:59.032 --> 15:00.900
LISTEN TO YOURSELF,
NORMAN.

15:01.001 --> 15:03.937
LISTEN TO WHAT
YOU ARE SAYING.

15:06.173 --> 15:08.575
WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE.

15:08.675 --> 15:09.842
JUSTIN.

15:09.943 --> 15:13.746
UNFORTUNATELY,
I WAS JUST LEAVING.

15:13.846 --> 15:15.382
OH.

15:17.384 --> 15:20.187
BETWEEN US.

15:20.287 --> 15:23.090
IF I'M LATE FOR
MY AFTERNOON SERVICE,

15:23.190 --> 15:24.757
THEY'LL START
WITHOUT ME.

15:24.857 --> 15:26.693
( laughing )

15:39.506 --> 15:42.342
FELIX, WANT TO FETCH ME
A SPOT OF SUGAR FOR MY COFFEE ?

15:42.442 --> 15:45.778
GO GET YOUR OWN SUGAR
WHY DON'T YOU, YOU...

15:45.878 --> 15:48.881
I'D BE NICE TO ME,
IF I WAS YOU.

15:48.982 --> 15:51.351
YEAH, WELL HE AIN'T YOU.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.620
ALTHOUGH IT'S HARD TO TELL
ON DAYS HE FORGETS TO SHAVE.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.955
( laughing )

15:56.056 --> 15:57.690
SO WHO IS THE LADY
CON LA BARBA ?

15:57.790 --> 15:58.891
THE QUEEN OF
THE CARNIVALE ?

15:58.992 --> 16:01.995
SHE THINKS SHE IS.

16:02.095 --> 16:04.931
LAUGH NOW, CHIQUITA.

16:05.032 --> 16:06.733
BUT THINGS
ARE CHANGING.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.868
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT
SAMSON'S SLEEPING IN THE TRUCK.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.137
THAT'S ENOUGH.

16:10.237 --> 16:12.239
NO ONE'S BUSINESS
BUT SAMSON'S.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.807
NEBOSS IS
EVERYBODY'S BUSINESS.

16:14.907 --> 16:16.343
SHUT UP, LILA.

16:16.443 --> 16:17.977
NO ONE SAID NOTHING
'BOUT A NEW BOSS.

16:18.078 --> 16:20.380
OH, HONEY,
IT'S ON THE DICE !

16:20.480 --> 16:23.216
WON'T BE LONG 'TIL
THE PROFESSOR TAKES OVER.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.685
NOT A CHINA MAN'S CHANCE.

16:25.785 --> 16:27.054
JUST WHAT WE NEED.

16:27.154 --> 16:28.988
THE BLIND
LEADING THE BLIND.

16:29.089 --> 16:30.357
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

16:30.457 --> 16:31.991
HE'S BEEN WORKING VERY
CLOSELY WITH MANAGEMENT.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.626
I DON'T CARE WHERE
ANYBODY'S SLEEPS.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.428
I WORK FOR SAMSON.

16:35.528 --> 16:38.131
Y'ALL CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT,
I'M JUST TELLIN' YA...

16:38.231 --> 16:40.167
THE KING IS DEAD.

16:40.267 --> 16:41.968
LONG LIVE THE KING.

16:42.069 --> 16:44.971
EVERYONE HAVING
A NICE LITTLE CHAT ?

16:45.072 --> 16:47.540
GETTING ALL THE GOSSIP
STRAIGHTENED OUT ?

16:47.640 --> 16:51.344
LET'S QUIT LOLLYGAGGIN'
AROUND AND FINISH IT UP.

16:51.444 --> 16:54.581
WE GOT WORK.

16:57.550 --> 17:00.153
LONG LIVE THE KING.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.096
GOOD MORNING, MOTHER.

17:09.196 --> 17:12.499
THOUGHT THAT WAS PRETTY FUNNY
LAST NIGHT, DIDN'T YOU ?

17:12.599 --> 17:16.703
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.338
DON'T BOTHER
DENYING IT.

17:18.438 --> 17:24.077
MAKING THE WORM MOVE,
THAT WAS A NICE TOUCH.

17:24.177 --> 17:27.080
I'VE BEEN THINKING
YOU COULD USE A HAIRCUT.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.116
I MEAN, IT'S 1934.

17:29.216 --> 17:31.418
AND LONG HAIR JUST ISN'T
THE STYLE ANYMORE.

17:31.518 --> 17:34.821
GOTTA BRING YOU
UP TO THE TIMES.

17:41.261 --> 17:43.296
SO TELL ME MORE ABOUT
THIS SO-CALLED RAPE.

17:43.396 --> 17:47.734
'CAUSE I BEEN WONDERING ABOUT IT
AND IT JUST ISN'T ADDING UP.

17:47.834 --> 17:52.205
IT WAS RAPE,
WASN'T IT ?

17:54.641 --> 17:55.775
YOU SAID IT WAS.

17:55.875 --> 17:59.179
BUT THEN, WE ONLY HAVE
YOUR SIDE OF THE STORY.

18:04.684 --> 18:07.019
BUT YOU DO, MOTHER.

18:07.120 --> 18:10.157
YOU DO HATE ME.

18:13.593 --> 18:14.927
BUT THAT'S OKAY.

18:15.027 --> 18:18.798
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

18:32.812 --> 18:36.483
( music playing )

18:45.458 --> 18:48.661
I GUESS SOME PEOPLE
WOULD CALL THAT DANCIN'.

18:48.761 --> 18:51.731
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH IT ?

18:51.831 --> 18:55.067
YOU'RE JUMPIN' AROUND
LIKE A FLEA ON A FLAT DOG.

18:55.168 --> 18:57.170
LIKE A WHAT ?

18:57.270 --> 18:59.506
NO STYLE.

18:59.606 --> 19:01.741
NO RHYTHM.

19:01.841 --> 19:04.043
NO TECHNIQUE.

19:04.143 --> 19:08.515
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
STUMPY WAS THINKING.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.958
MY MOTHER CAN
BE A REAL BITCH.

19:19.058 --> 19:22.329
SI, UNA CHUCHA GORDA.

19:27.099 --> 19:30.503
LET ME TEACH YOU
A COUPLE STEPS.

19:32.639 --> 19:34.374
TRY THIS.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.858
( dog barking )

19:51.958 --> 19:54.594
( sighing )

20:00.367 --> 20:03.336
HERE, LET ME,
LET ME TAKE THAT.

20:03.436 --> 20:07.407
THANK YOU, CLAYTON.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.815
HE'S SOMETHING,
ISN'T HE ?

20:15.915 --> 20:18.084
HE AIN'T HALF BAD.

20:18.184 --> 20:20.219
TOOK ME A LONG TIME
TO SEE IT.

20:20.320 --> 20:23.856
I WOULDN'T HAVE,
IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU.

20:23.956 --> 20:25.024
NO, YOU WOULD'VE.

20:25.124 --> 20:26.192
NO.

20:26.293 --> 20:27.827
YOU SET ME STRAIGHT.

20:27.927 --> 20:30.597
I OWE YOU.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.803
THING IS,
NOW THAT I'M READY,

20:36.903 --> 20:39.372
HE ISN'T.

20:39.472 --> 20:42.542
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT ?

20:45.312 --> 20:47.814
THE OTHER NIGHT,
WE WERE...

20:47.914 --> 20:53.920
GETTING CLOSE AND SOMETHING
ALMOST HAPPENED,

20:54.020 --> 20:56.289
BUT THEN HE STOPPED.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.958
WELL, THAT'S CURIOUS,
DID HE SAY WHY ?

20:59.058 --> 21:01.127
SAID HE WANTED
TO GO SLOW.

21:01.227 --> 21:04.564
SOMETIMES SLOW
IS BEST.

21:04.664 --> 21:05.932
YOU THINK ?

21:06.032 --> 21:09.336
I THINK YOU CAN'T FORCE
SOMETHIN' THAT AIN'T WORKIN'.

21:09.436 --> 21:11.471
SOMETIMES, IT'S JUST
AIN'T MEANT TO BE.

21:11.571 --> 21:15.141
MAYBE THERE'S ANOTHER FELLA
OUT THERE FOR YA.

21:15.241 --> 21:18.210
BUT YOU WERE THE ONE WHO TOLD ME
HOW LUCKY I WAS TO HAVE HIM.

21:18.311 --> 21:19.846
TRUE.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.213
YOU WERE RIGHT.

21:21.314 --> 21:23.249
IT'S JUST THAT...

21:23.350 --> 21:26.619
HE ALREADY
HURT ME ONCE.

21:26.719 --> 21:31.691
IN THIS LIFE
THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES.

21:32.825 --> 21:36.095
BUT YOU'VE BEEN
AROUND, RIGHT ?

21:36.195 --> 21:37.564
YOU CAN TELL.

21:37.664 --> 21:42.335
YOU THINK
I CAN TRUST HIM ?

21:44.036 --> 21:44.904
YEAH.

21:45.004 --> 21:47.374
YOU CAN.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.316
YOU SAID I NEED
TO TRUST PEOPLE.

21:57.417 --> 22:00.252
OKAY, THEN
I'M TRUSTING YOU.

22:00.353 --> 22:03.456
I SEE SCUDDER
ALL THE TIME.

22:03.556 --> 22:07.226
IN DREAMS,
IN DAYLIGHT.

22:07.326 --> 22:10.530
I SAW HIM IN BABYLON,
I SAW HIM IN SOME CHURCH,

22:10.630 --> 22:12.965
LAST NIGHT,
I DON'T KNOW WHY

22:13.065 --> 22:16.168
AND I DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT'S REAL
OR WHAT'S NOT ANYMORE.

22:16.268 --> 22:18.471
SO IF YOU KNOW
SOMETHIN',

22:18.571 --> 22:20.673
IF YOU KNOW WHY I SEE
THE THINGS I DO

22:20.773 --> 22:24.043
OR YOU CAN TELL ME SOMETHIN',
THEN I'M WILLING TO TRUST YOU,

22:24.143 --> 22:26.846
AND I'LL LISTEN TO WHATEVER
IT IS YOU GOT TO SAY.

22:33.553 --> 22:37.089
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU SEE
ALL THE THINGS YOU DO...

22:37.189 --> 22:39.659
I WISH I DID.

22:39.759 --> 22:42.929
BUT YOU SAID SOMETHING HAPPENED
BAD IN THE OLD COUNTRY.

22:43.029 --> 22:44.697
WHAT WAS IT ?

22:44.797 --> 22:48.100
ALL I KNOW IS, IT HAD
SOMETHING TO DO WITH LODZ.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.503
AND ANYTHING
INVOLVIN' THAT S.O.B.

22:50.603 --> 22:53.272
WELL, THAT'S IT ?

22:53.372 --> 22:56.976
THAT'S ALL YOU
GOTTA TELL ME ?

23:03.282 --> 23:05.418
I CAN TELL YOU THIS,

23:05.518 --> 23:09.456
IT WEREN'T NO ACCIDENT WHEN
WE PICKED YOU UP IN MILFAY.

23:09.556 --> 23:13.092
MANAGEMENT SAYS
YOU WAS EXPECTED.

23:17.296 --> 23:20.767
EXPECTED, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE HELL THAT MEANS EITHER.

23:25.204 --> 23:27.039
WATCH YOURSELF.

23:28.140 --> 23:29.909
WHY ?

23:30.009 --> 23:31.844
SOMETHIN'S BUILDIN', KID.

23:31.944 --> 23:35.482
I CAN FEEL IT.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.720
WHEN IT BREAKS...

24:01.774 --> 24:05.311
MENDING DRESSES
FOR A SNAKE-CHARMER.

24:05.411 --> 24:08.581
WASTE OF MY TALENT.

24:09.982 --> 24:13.520
FIRST THING I'M GONNA DO
IS MOVE OUT OF THE TEN-IN-ONE.

24:13.620 --> 24:16.355
GET MY OWN TENT,
NOT BURIED IN THE MIDDLE,

24:16.455 --> 24:18.558
BUT RIGHT UP FRONT.

24:18.658 --> 24:20.960
AND A NEW
BANNER, TOO.

24:21.060 --> 24:23.563
AND FROM NOW ON,

24:23.663 --> 24:26.265
POSSUM CAN BRING OUR MEALS
RIGHT TO THE TRAILER.

24:26.365 --> 24:28.067
WE WON'T HAVE TO HIKE UP
TO THE COOK TENT

24:28.167 --> 24:30.136
WITH ALL
THE RIFF RAFF.

24:32.371 --> 24:33.706
LODZ ?

24:33.806 --> 24:35.742
ARE YOU EVEN
LISTENIN' ?

24:35.842 --> 24:37.076
WHAT ?

24:37.176 --> 24:39.378
SORRY, MY DEAR.

24:39.478 --> 24:42.248
I'M A LITTLE BIT
PREOCCUPIED.

24:42.348 --> 24:45.685
ANYTHING I CAN DO ?

24:45.785 --> 24:49.088
WE NEED TO GO
INTO TOWN.

24:49.188 --> 24:50.456
BUSINESS OR PLEASURE ?

24:50.557 --> 24:52.959
PLEASURE FOR YOU.

24:53.059 --> 24:55.261
BUSINESS FOR ME.

24:55.361 --> 24:58.164
WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS ?

25:00.499 --> 25:04.070
IT'S A SURPRISE.

25:09.475 --> 25:12.979
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
LEAVE IT THE HELL ALONE.

25:13.079 --> 25:14.346
I CAN'T.

25:14.446 --> 25:16.649
I WANT TO TRY AGAIN.

25:16.749 --> 25:18.918
BUT SLOW
LIKE YOU SAID.

25:19.018 --> 25:21.320
YOU WERE RIGHT.

25:21.420 --> 25:24.924
WHEN DID THAT
THUNDERBOLT HIT YA ?

25:28.027 --> 25:29.829
I MEAN IT.

25:34.601 --> 25:36.569
JESUS, SOFIE.

25:36.669 --> 25:39.071
I NEVER KNOW WHETHER
YOU'RE COMIN' OR GOIN'.

25:42.008 --> 25:45.244
I ONLY KNOW WHENEVER
I SPEND TIME WITH YOU,

25:45.344 --> 25:47.546
I FEEL LIKE
I'VE BEEN CHEWED UP.

25:53.986 --> 25:57.590
IT DOESN'T HAVE
TO BE THAT WAY.

26:17.476 --> 26:19.846
YOU'VE KNOWN HIM
LONGER THAN ANYONE.

26:19.946 --> 26:23.315
I LIKE TO LISTEN
TO THE RADIO, MR. DOLAN.

26:23.415 --> 26:26.085
I DON'T FANCY MYSELF
TALKING ON IT.

26:26.185 --> 26:27.987
DON'T WORRY.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.722
I WON'T PUT YOU IN FRONT
OF THE MIKE, REVEREND.

26:29.822 --> 26:31.390
THIS IS JUST
BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

26:31.490 --> 26:33.993
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO FOUND THEM.

26:34.093 --> 26:36.262
JUSTIN AND IRIS.

26:36.362 --> 26:37.496
YOU TOOK THEM IN.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.465
I LOVE THEM
LIKE MY OWN.

26:39.565 --> 26:41.467
THEY'RE VERY LUCKY.

26:41.567 --> 26:43.636
WHEN JUSTIN
WAS YOUNGER,

26:43.736 --> 26:46.038
DID YOU EVER SEE
ANY SIGN THAT

26:46.138 --> 26:48.340
HE WAS DESTINED TO BE
A SPIRITUAL LEADER ?

26:48.440 --> 26:50.643
I ALWAYS KNEW THAT
GOD SET HIM APART.

26:50.743 --> 26:54.213
WHERE DO YOU THINK HE'S BEEN
THESE PAST FEW WEEKS ?

26:56.382 --> 26:58.718
WE'RE JUST GLAD
HE'S HOME.

26:58.818 --> 27:02.421
WOULD IT SURPRISE YOU
TO KNOW HE WAS IN AN ASYLUM,

27:02.521 --> 27:05.291
RECEIVING
PSYCHIATRIC HELP ?

27:05.391 --> 27:09.161
HE TOLD YOU THAT ?

27:09.261 --> 27:10.663
NO, HE DIDN'T.

27:10.763 --> 27:12.865
BUT I'M A REPORTER,
REVEREND.

27:12.965 --> 27:17.536
I'M SORRY, MR. DOLAN,
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

27:17.636 --> 27:20.840
DO YOU BELIEVE
HE NEEDS HELP ?

27:20.940 --> 27:22.474
I MEAN,
IS THERE A PROBLEM ?

27:22.574 --> 27:23.743
IF THERE IS...

27:23.843 --> 27:26.879
WE'LL HANDLE IT FROM
WITHIN THE CHURCH.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.681
NOT IF THE POLICE
GET INVOLVED.

27:28.781 --> 27:32.251
I DUG UP AN UNFILED
POLICE REPORT.

27:32.351 --> 27:35.487
A CAR MATCHING JUSTIN'S WAS
SEEN NEAR THE DIGNITY MINISTRY

27:35.587 --> 27:37.456
JUST BEFORE
IT BURNED DOWN.

27:37.556 --> 27:40.659
IT WAS HIS CHURCH.

27:40.760 --> 27:43.195
PERHAPS HE WAS
WORKING THERE.

27:43.295 --> 27:44.797
11 O'CLOCK AT NIGHT ?

27:44.897 --> 27:46.532
SOMETHING STRANGE IS
HAPPENING HERE, REVEREND.

27:46.632 --> 27:48.667
I WAS AT THE SERVICE
LAST WEEK.

27:48.768 --> 27:50.202
I SAW THE WAY
PEOPLE CAME TO HIM.

27:50.302 --> 27:52.638
IT WASN'T LIKE ANY BAPTISM
I'VE EVER SEEN.

27:52.739 --> 27:56.175
YOU SAW SOMETHING, TOO.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.951
GOOD DAY, MR. DOLAN.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.023
WHAT ARE YOU
AFRAID OF ?

28:26.105 --> 28:27.506
HEY.

28:27.606 --> 28:29.275
HEY.

28:29.375 --> 28:30.743
HOW'S YOUR HEAD ?

28:30.843 --> 28:32.678
SAME DOG THAT
BIT YOU, BIT ME.

28:32.779 --> 28:35.047
I THINK WE DID GET
A LITTLE TIGHT.

28:35.147 --> 28:37.649
GIRL, YOU WERE DRUNKER
THAN A FIDDLER'S BITCH.

28:37.750 --> 28:40.152
YOUR BOTTLE,
YOUR FAULT.

28:40.252 --> 28:43.055
COME HERE.

28:43.155 --> 28:45.624
I...

28:45.724 --> 28:48.127
TALKED TO JONESY.

28:48.227 --> 28:49.428
YOU DID ?

28:49.528 --> 28:50.797
YEAH.

28:50.897 --> 28:52.598
I THOUGHT I'D MESSED
THINGS UP PRETTY BAD,

28:52.698 --> 28:54.666
BUT HE SAID
WE COULD TRY AGAIN.

28:54.767 --> 28:56.668
THAT'S GREAT.

28:56.769 --> 28:58.604
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.

28:58.704 --> 29:01.507
JUST BE CAREFUL.

29:01.607 --> 29:04.343
CAREFUL ?

29:04.443 --> 29:08.380
I'M JUST SAYIN',
MEN ARE DOGS.

29:13.552 --> 29:15.321
SO, YOU OKAY ?

29:15.421 --> 29:17.289
YEAH.

29:17.389 --> 29:20.526
WHY ?

29:23.362 --> 29:25.798
YOU WERE LOOKIN' AT ME
KIND OF STRANGE LAST NIGHT.

29:25.898 --> 29:29.135
WON'T GO WITHIN
10 MILES OF

29:29.235 --> 29:31.904
ANYTHING'S THAT'S GOT
A WORM AT THE BOTTOM.

29:32.004 --> 29:33.806
BUT OTHER
THAN THAT...

29:33.906 --> 29:36.675
THEN EVERYTHING'S
HUCKY DUCK ?

29:36.775 --> 29:40.146
HUCKY DUCK.

29:47.920 --> 29:50.056
SOFIE CAME
TO TALK TO ME TODAY.

29:50.156 --> 29:51.891
ME, TOO.

29:51.991 --> 29:53.960
WHAT'D SHE SAY ?

29:54.060 --> 29:55.794
WHAT DO YOU
THINK SHE SAID ?

29:55.895 --> 29:57.663
SHE'S CRAZY
ABOUT YOU.

29:57.763 --> 29:59.498
YEAH.

29:59.598 --> 30:01.233
THIS WEEK.

30:01.333 --> 30:04.070
WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE
TO BE MORE CAREFUL.

30:04.170 --> 30:07.639
NO, NO.

30:07.739 --> 30:09.341
NO ?

30:09.441 --> 30:11.277
I CAN'T.

30:11.377 --> 30:15.314
I OWE IT TO MYSELF
TO GIVE THIS THING A CHANCE.

30:15.414 --> 30:18.717
YOU JUST SAID YOURSELF, THE GIRL
CAN'T EVEN MAKE UP HER MIND.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.487
IT'S SOMETHIN' I BEEN
WANTIN' FOR A LONG TIME.

30:21.587 --> 30:24.556
YOU AND ME JUST
COMPLICATE IT UP.

30:24.656 --> 30:26.292
WELL, YOU WEREN'T WORRIED
ABOUT IT BEING COMPLICATED

30:26.392 --> 30:28.527
WHEN I WAS SUCKIN'
THE HEAD OFF YOUR HAMMER.

30:28.627 --> 30:30.529
RITA SUE, PLEASE.

30:30.629 --> 30:32.098
YOU THINK THIS
IS STICKY FOR YOU ?

30:32.198 --> 30:34.733
I'M THE ONE
WHO'S MARRIED.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.702
ALL THE MORE REASON
I SHOULD BE WITH SOFIE.

30:36.802 --> 30:38.770
SHE'S A KID.

30:38.871 --> 30:41.840
SHE'S IT FOR ME.

30:41.941 --> 30:45.411
COURSE SHE IS.

30:45.511 --> 30:49.415
'CAUSE SHE'S THE GIRL
IN THE FAIRY-TALE
AND YOU'RE THE HERO.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.783
IT AIN'T HOW IT IS.

30:51.884 --> 30:53.452
THEN LOOK IN MY EYES

30:53.552 --> 30:55.988
AND TELL ME YOU DON'T WANT
TO THROW ME DOWN RIGHT HERE.

30:56.088 --> 31:00.192
I CAN'T, I CAN'T.

31:02.094 --> 31:04.263
I SHOULD'VE
SEEN THIS COMIN'.

31:04.363 --> 31:06.865
WE DODGED A BULLET,
YOU AND ME, AND YOU KNOW IT.

31:06.966 --> 31:08.034
IF STUMPY FOUND OUT--

31:08.134 --> 31:09.468
DON'T HIDE
BEHIND STUMPY !

31:09.568 --> 31:11.137
RITA SUE, PLEASE.

31:11.237 --> 31:14.106
YOU GAVE
SOMETHIN' TO ME.

31:14.206 --> 31:19.011
BUT IT'S
GOIN' NOWHERE.

31:23.649 --> 31:25.617
IT'S OVER.

31:31.090 --> 31:33.825
STUMPY FELT
SORRY FOR YOU.

31:33.926 --> 31:36.628
WANTED TO MAKE YOU
A MAN AGAIN.

31:36.728 --> 31:40.032
BUT IT'S CLEAR NOW THAT NO
AMOUNT OF FUCKIN' CAN DO THAT.

31:40.132 --> 31:44.903
YOU'RE STILL THE SAME
YELLOW GIMP YOU ALWAYS WERE.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.436
( whistling )

32:17.536 --> 32:21.473
NOTICED A LITTLE SWAGGER
IN YOUR WALK TODAY.

32:21.573 --> 32:24.443
WONDER WHY THAT IS ?

32:24.543 --> 32:27.346
COULD IT BE SOMEONE
GOT HIS GUN CLEANED ?

32:27.446 --> 32:29.881
DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKIN' 'BOUT.

32:29.982 --> 32:31.283
DON'T BE SHY.

32:31.383 --> 32:32.718
EVERYBODY KNOWS.

32:32.818 --> 32:34.386
NO SECRETS
'ROUND HERE.

32:34.486 --> 32:37.356
I'M TRYIN' TO WORK.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.491
HOW WAS SHE ?

32:39.591 --> 32:42.528
GRATEFUL,
I IMAGINE.

32:45.864 --> 32:47.799
I'D ALWAYS KIND OF
HOPED THAT UH...

32:47.899 --> 32:52.671
I MIGHT BE THE ONE
TO PICK THAT CHERRY.

32:54.673 --> 32:56.742
I'M WORKIN'.

33:02.881 --> 33:05.751
YOU GET TIRED
OF GRANDMA,

33:05.851 --> 33:08.554
YOU COME SEE LILA.

33:15.727 --> 33:17.663
AN ASYLUM ?

33:17.763 --> 33:18.730
THAT'S PREPOSTEROUS.

33:18.830 --> 33:19.731
IS IT ?

33:19.831 --> 33:21.933
REPORTERS MAKE
THINGS UP.

33:22.034 --> 33:23.469
THEY'LL SAY ANYTHING
FOR A GOOD STORY.

33:23.569 --> 33:25.971
SO JUSTIN WAS HOME WITH YOU
THE NIGHT OF THE FIRE ?

33:26.072 --> 33:27.706
OF COURSE,
HE WAS ASLEEP IN BED.

33:27.806 --> 33:29.141
WHAT KIND OF
QUESTION IS THAT ?

33:29.241 --> 33:31.377
THE KIND OF QUESTION
THE POLICE WILL BE ASKING.

33:31.477 --> 33:33.212
THE POLICE ?

33:33.312 --> 33:34.813
YEAH, IF MR. DOLAN GOES
PUBLIC WITH HIS STORY.

33:34.913 --> 33:39.651
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT JUSTIN
WOULD BURN DOWN HIS OWN CHURCH ?

33:39.751 --> 33:42.354
DO YOU ?

33:42.454 --> 33:46.425
I THINK MR. DOLAN HAS SUNK TO
NEW LOWS WITH HIS FILTHY LIES.

33:46.525 --> 33:49.728
YOU BETTER HOPE
THEY ARE LIES, IRIS.

33:49.828 --> 33:51.497
THERE'S GOING
TO BE A POINT

33:51.597 --> 33:53.232
WHERE I CAN'T KEEP
THIS FROM THE BISHOP.

33:53.332 --> 33:54.400
THERE'S NO NEED
TO BRING HIM IN.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.935
TOO MANY
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.970
JUSTIN WILL
ANSWER THEM.

33:59.071 --> 34:01.540
THERE'S AN EXPLANATION
FOR EVERYTHING.

34:03.242 --> 34:06.645
( music playing )

34:11.217 --> 34:13.719
PEOPLE SURE KNOW
HOW TO THROW A FANDANGO.

34:13.819 --> 34:16.555
I THOUGHT
YOU'D ENJOY IT.

34:16.655 --> 34:18.324
YOU'LL BE ALRIGHT ?

34:18.424 --> 34:21.727
MEET ME HERE
IN ONE HOUR.

34:30.602 --> 34:33.139
QUE QUIERES, SEÃ±OR ?

34:35.641 --> 34:37.676
GRACIAS.

34:37.776 --> 34:40.746
UNA CULEBRA.

34:40.846 --> 34:43.382
CULEBRA ?

34:46.585 --> 34:48.120
CHAMACO !

34:48.220 --> 34:49.188
( whistling )

34:49.288 --> 34:51.523
UN MEMENTO, POR FAVOR.

34:53.725 --> 34:55.327
YO TE UNO VIEJO.

34:55.427 --> 34:58.530
YO AMENDE ESA CULEBRA.

34:59.698 --> 35:00.799
OKAY.

35:00.899 --> 35:02.401
HE'LL TAKE CARE
OF YOU, SIR.

35:02.501 --> 35:05.437
TAMBIEN.

35:11.710 --> 35:15.181
( animal sounds )

35:38.570 --> 35:40.406
( whispering )

35:50.816 --> 35:52.351
( laughing )

35:52.451 --> 35:53.652
UNA CULEBRA NEGRA.

35:53.752 --> 35:57.055
MUY BONITA ?

35:57.155 --> 35:58.824
VENENOSO ?

35:58.924 --> 36:00.726
MUY PELIGROSO.

36:00.826 --> 36:02.160
ES UN ASESINO.

36:02.261 --> 36:06.432
EXCELENTE.

36:07.933 --> 36:09.167
BUENO.

36:09.268 --> 36:12.204
PANOLO EN UN BOLSO.

36:20.078 --> 36:22.180
SAMSON, HOW OLD
DO YOU THINK I AM ?

36:22.281 --> 36:25.417
NO, NO, NO, NO...

36:25.517 --> 36:26.318
COME ON.

36:26.418 --> 36:30.489
GIVE IT A SHOT.

36:30.589 --> 36:33.292
OLDER THAN SHIRLEY TEMPLE
AND YOUNGER THAN JOAN OF ARC.

36:33.392 --> 36:35.861
PUT A YEAR ON IT.

36:40.165 --> 36:42.368
ALRIGHT.

36:42.468 --> 36:45.437
50...

36:45.537 --> 36:49.207
TWO.

36:49.308 --> 36:51.109
CLOSE ENOUGH.

36:51.209 --> 36:54.079
HOW MANY YEARS YOU THINK
BETWEEN ME AND THE KID ?

36:54.179 --> 36:57.983
WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH
THE PRICE OF BEANS IN TIJUANA ?

36:58.083 --> 37:00.118
NOT A DAMN THING.

37:00.218 --> 37:03.789
MY ADVICE ?

37:03.889 --> 37:07.125
STAY AWAY FROM HIM.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.827
I'M TOO OLD.

37:08.927 --> 37:10.095
JUST SAY IT.

37:10.195 --> 37:11.530
NO, NO, IT AIN'T THAT.

37:11.630 --> 37:15.967
YOU COULD STILL BUCK
A BULL OFF A BRIDGE.

37:18.203 --> 37:20.171
YOU REMEMBER
HACK SCUDDER.

37:20.272 --> 37:23.575
PROBABLY BETTER
THAN ANYONE ELSE.

37:23.675 --> 37:26.712
HE WAS TROUBLE.

37:27.879 --> 37:30.882
I LIKE THE KID, I DO.

37:32.884 --> 37:35.687
10 TIMES THE TROUBLE.

39:15.253 --> 39:16.588
FELIX.

39:16.688 --> 39:17.623

OF BUCKETS OF WATER.

39:19.357 --> 39:20.291

39:20.392 --> 39:21.493
JUST DO IT.

39:21.593 --> 39:23.094
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

39:44.049 --> 39:46.452
EXCUSE ME,

39:46.552 --> 39:50.021
SOMEBODY STOP

39:50.121 --> 39:54.526
AND WHAT A HANDSOME BUNCH
OF GENTLEMEN YOU ARE.

39:56.127 --> 39:57.996
HOW NICELY DRESSED.

39:58.096 --> 40:00.666

POCKET SQUARES,

40:00.766 --> 40:03.602

40:03.702 --> 40:06.171
C'MON NOW,

40:29.861 --> 40:31.429
LOOK AT ME.

40:31.530 --> 40:33.632

DRY A GIRL OFF ?

40:36.802 --> 40:38.770

40:45.443 --> 40:49.515
DO YOU LIKE THAT ?

40:54.319 --> 40:55.754

40:55.854 --> 40:58.690
HEY, HEY.

40:59.825 --> 41:03.094
SUCH GENTLEMEN,
THANK YOU.

41:10.301 --> 41:12.070
YOUR WIFE.

41:12.170 --> 41:13.739
SHE IS ONE
SEXY MUJERZUELA.

41:13.839 --> 41:16.642
MAYBE YOU GO SLEEP
WITH HER THEN.

41:16.742 --> 41:20.512
YOU ARE MORE MY TYPE.

41:20.612 --> 41:23.081
JESUS, WOMAN !

41:23.181 --> 41:25.050

41:26.384 --> 41:27.352
YOU'RE BOTH
DRIVIN' ME CRAZY.

41:27.452 --> 41:28.787
GOD.

41:28.887 --> 41:30.622
NOT LIKE I DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH
TROUBLE WITH ONE WOMAN,

41:30.722 --> 41:31.723
I HAD TO GO
DOUBLE UP ON IT.

41:31.823 --> 41:33.091
I THOUGHT
YOU LIKED ME.

41:33.191 --> 41:34.225
NO, I DO...

41:34.325 --> 41:36.127
I DO.

41:36.227 --> 41:38.664
IT'S JUST THAT I'M GETTING
ALL TURNED AROUND NOW.

41:38.764 --> 41:41.733
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN NEXT.

41:41.833 --> 41:44.970
YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU NEED ?

41:45.070 --> 41:47.505
A BRUJA.

41:47.606 --> 41:49.407
IT'S ALL A CON !

41:49.507 --> 41:50.876
WATCH WHAT YOU SAY.

41:50.976 --> 41:52.578
WHERE I COME FROM,
A BRUJA IS RESPECTED.

41:52.678 --> 41:54.713
MAYBE SHE CAN HELP YOU
WITH YOUR WOMAN PROBLEM.

41:54.813 --> 41:57.282
YOU GOT A CUSTOMER.

41:57.382 --> 41:58.784
STUMPY ?

41:58.884 --> 42:01.953
I'LL TRY

HEY THERE, APPY !

42:04.723 --> 42:07.959

42:11.162 --> 42:14.099
SORRY.

42:18.303 --> 42:22.307
SHUFFLE THE CARDS AND
CUT 'EM WITH YOUR LEFT HAND.

42:32.918 --> 42:34.419
THERE.

42:34.519 --> 42:36.121
WHAT, THIS SUPPOSED
TO TELL MY FUTURE ?

42:36.221 --> 42:39.057
ASK ANYTHING
YOU WANT.

42:39.157 --> 42:41.259
OKAY...

42:45.731 --> 42:49.334
WHAT COLOR'S MY PISS
GONNA BE TOMORROW ?

42:49.434 --> 42:51.036
( laughing )

42:51.136 --> 42:53.404
I'M JUST KIDDIN'.

42:53.504 --> 42:55.674
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO ASK.

42:55.774 --> 42:58.476
YOU WANNA START ?

42:58.576 --> 43:01.647
ALRIGHT.

43:03.782 --> 43:06.151
THE HEIROPHANT.

43:06.251 --> 43:09.154
NOW THAT'S A WORD
YOU DON'T HEAR EVERY DAY.

43:09.254 --> 43:11.322
WELL, IT'S ANCIENT GREEK.

43:11.422 --> 43:14.092
IT MEANS A MAN WITH GREAT POWER
AND AUTHORITY OVER OTHERS.

43:14.192 --> 43:16.962
THE THING IS,
HE'S UPSIDE DOWN, SO...

43:17.062 --> 43:20.799
THAT MEANS THE OPPOSITE
OF YOU RIGHT NOW.

43:20.899 --> 43:26.071
WELL, WHAT'S
THE NEXT CARD ?

43:27.505 --> 43:30.141
WELL, THAT LOOKS
LIKE A GOOD CARD FOR ME.

43:30.241 --> 43:32.844
IT MEANS A STRONG
PARTNERSHIP OR UNION.

43:32.944 --> 43:34.412
THAT'S RIGHT SIDE UP.

43:34.512 --> 43:36.715
THAT'S PROBABLY
ME AND RITA SUE.

43:36.815 --> 43:39.484
YEAH, COULD BE.

43:39.584 --> 43:41.720
EXCEPT FOR
THIS NEXT ONE.

43:41.820 --> 43:43.722
THE TWO OF CUPS.

43:43.822 --> 43:47.726
MEANS THERE'S
A NEW RELATIONSHIP.

43:50.328 --> 43:53.665
THE NEW DANCER,
MAYBE ?

43:58.569 --> 44:00.538
YOU SAW MY EYE
TWITCHIN', DIDN'T YA ?

44:00.638 --> 44:03.474
IT IS IN THE CARDS,
STUMPY.

44:03.574 --> 44:05.777
OH YEAH,
SURE IT IS.

44:07.913 --> 44:10.415
THE KNIGHT OF SWORDS.

44:14.219 --> 44:16.822
THAT UM...

44:16.922 --> 44:19.090
MEANS THERE'S ANOTHER
MAN IN YOUR HOUSE.

44:19.190 --> 44:24.162
THERE'S A LOT OTHER MEN
IN MY HOUSE.

44:26.297 --> 44:28.199
MOTHER.

44:28.299 --> 44:30.802
WAIT.

44:30.902 --> 44:34.906
LET HER TALK,
DON'T STOP HER.

44:37.675 --> 44:40.445
IT'S JUST ONE MAN...

44:40.545 --> 44:42.347
THAT KEEPS
COMING BACK.

44:42.447 --> 44:45.350
AND HE'S NOT
A JOHNNY.

44:45.450 --> 44:48.119
HE'S A FRIEND.

44:57.796 --> 45:00.932
GOTTA BE A MISTAKE.

45:10.308 --> 45:13.178
ARE YOU GONNA
TELL ME WHO IT IS ?

45:20.385 --> 45:23.721
YOU'RE A LIAR.

45:31.662 --> 45:33.464
READING'S OVER.

45:33.564 --> 45:34.732
WAIT.

45:34.833 --> 45:36.334
WAIT, YOU CAN'T DO THIS,
YOU CAN'T STOP NOW.

45:36.434 --> 45:38.336
I'M SORRY, STUMPY, I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE.

45:38.436 --> 45:39.270
YOU CAN'T JUST STOP.

45:39.370 --> 45:42.240
PLEASE LEAVE.

45:51.516 --> 45:53.284
SORRY.

45:55.720 --> 45:57.422
WHO ELSE KNOWS
ABOUT THIS ?

45:57.522 --> 46:00.158
DOES LIBBY KNOW ?

46:00.258 --> 46:03.228
TELL ME !

47:00.318 --> 47:03.521

LILA ?

47:13.464 --> 47:16.401

47:28.346 --> 47:30.215
AH !

47:34.252 --> 47:36.454
OH LORD.

47:43.194 --> 47:45.997
AND HE'S GOING TO REPEAT THESE
FABRICATIONS OVER THE RADIO ?

47:46.097 --> 47:47.565
IT'S MONSTROUS.

47:47.665 --> 47:48.733
IT'S ABSURD.

47:48.833 --> 47:50.568
HE HAS NO PROOF.

47:50.668 --> 47:52.437
HE'S HAS
A POLICE REPORT.

47:52.537 --> 47:54.072
AN AUTOMOBILE.

47:54.172 --> 47:56.474
A BLACK FORD, THERE ARE
THOUSANDS OF THEM.

47:56.574 --> 47:57.943
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

47:58.043 --> 48:02.647
ONCE THIS STORY IS OUT,
THE DAMAGE IS DONE.

48:02.747 --> 48:04.049
YOU DON'T GET
TO TAKE IT BACK.

48:04.149 --> 48:06.317
YOU'LL BE RUINED.

48:20.765 --> 48:23.034
JUSTIN, WHERE
ARE YOU GOING ?

48:23.134 --> 48:25.603
I'LL MEET WITH HIM,
WE'LL TALK.

48:25.703 --> 48:26.904
THAT WON'T
DO ANY GOOD.

48:27.005 --> 48:28.473
OH, I BELIEVE IT WILL.

48:28.573 --> 48:30.508
HE'S SPOKEN
WITH NORMAN.

48:30.608 --> 48:32.010
HE HAS ?

48:32.110 --> 48:34.445
YES, STIRRED
THINGS UP WITH HIM.

48:34.545 --> 48:36.047
QUESTIONS, ACCUSATIONS.

48:36.147 --> 48:38.483
NORMAN'S EVEN THREATENING
TO BRING IN THE BISHOP.

48:38.583 --> 48:43.254
WELL, LET THE BISHOP COME,
WE HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE.

48:43.354 --> 48:46.024
YES, WE DO !

48:47.892 --> 48:51.596
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING ?

49:02.440 --> 49:04.342
IRIS ?

49:04.442 --> 49:05.910
I DID IT FOR YOU.

49:06.011 --> 49:08.113
BUT THE CHILDREN
WHO DIED...

49:08.213 --> 49:09.780
THEY WERE SACRIFICED.

49:09.880 --> 49:12.050
LIKE THE LAMBS
OF ABRAHAM.

49:12.150 --> 49:13.918
SACRIFICED ?!

49:14.019 --> 49:15.320

TEMPLETON'S CHECK,

49:16.954 --> 49:19.757
DONATIONS, MONEY

49:27.565 --> 49:30.301

49:37.608 --> 49:40.411
