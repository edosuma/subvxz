WEBVTT

00:01.933 --> 00:03.900
- DON'T YOU MISS ITALY, RAY?

00:03.900 --> 00:07.200
LOOK, I TOOK THAT RIGHT
FROM AUNT COLLETTA'S BALCONY.

00:07.200 --> 00:09.400
- MAN, LOOK AT THAT LAKE.
- MM.

00:09.400 --> 00:13.200
- NEXT TIME WE GO,
LET'S SWIM NAKED.

00:13.200 --> 00:15.800
- YOU KNOW,
THERE'S FISH IN THERE.

00:15.800 --> 00:17.500
- OKAY, THEN JUST YOU.

00:20.133 --> 00:22.233
- OH, I JUST LOVED IT
SO MUCH THERE.

00:22.233 --> 00:24.233
EVERYBODY GOT ALONG
SO WELL.

00:24.233 --> 00:25.767
I JUST WISH WE COULD HOLD ON
TO THAT FEELING,

00:25.767 --> 00:28.900
YOU KNOW, OF JUST
ENJOYING EVERY DAY.

00:28.900 --> 00:30.200
- HOW ABOUT WE GO UPSTAIRS

00:30.200 --> 00:34.067
AND ENJOY THE REST
OF TODAY?

00:34.067 --> 00:36.200
- OKAY.

00:39.867 --> 00:41.867
[car approaching]

00:41.867 --> 00:43.633
YOU HEAR THAT?

01:36.733 --> 01:38.033
- HEY.

01:44.433 --> 01:47.533
- THIS IS
YOUR FATHER'S FAULT.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.267
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

01:51.267 --> 01:53.967
I WAS SAYING "STOP."

01:53.967 --> 01:55.967
- I WAS STOMPING
ON THE BRAKES,

01:55.967 --> 01:57.267
BUT NOTHING HAPPENED.

01:57.267 --> 01:59.200
- OH, MY GOD.

01:59.200 --> 02:02.367
[stuttering]

02:05.100 --> 02:08.067
OUR HOUSE.
LOOK AT OUR HOUSE.

02:08.067 --> 02:09.900
- I KNOW. I KNOW.

02:09.900 --> 02:12.100
MA, WHAT THE HELL?

02:15.800 --> 02:17.200
- HE KNEW ABOUT THE BRAKES.

02:17.200 --> 02:18.833
WHAT DID THE MECHANIC SAY
ABOUT THE BRAKES?

02:18.833 --> 02:19.833
TELL THEM.

02:19.833 --> 02:21.633
- AH!

02:21.633 --> 02:23.767
AW, LOOK AT THIS.

02:33.800 --> 02:36.133
- THE MECHANIC SAID THAT
THE BRAKES WERE BAD.

02:36.133 --> 02:37.933
- OF COURSE
HE'S GOING TO SAY THAT.

02:37.933 --> 02:41.033
EVERY TIME I BRING THE CAR IN,
HE SAYS THE BRAKES ARE BAD.

02:41.033 --> 02:44.167
- WELL, I THINK
THE BRAKES ARE BAD, FRANK.

02:44.167 --> 02:46.400
- OKAY, FINE.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.033
I'LL HAVE
THE BRAKES CHECKED

02:48.033 --> 02:51.067
WHEN I GET
THE TAILLIGHT FIXED.

02:51.067 --> 02:52.500
- THE TAILLIGHT?

02:52.500 --> 02:55.133
FRANK,
LOOK AT THE HOUSE!

02:55.133 --> 02:57.600
- I SAW IT.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.400
LOOK AT THIS.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.733
THIS DRYWALL,
IT'S LIKE PAPER,

03:01.733 --> 03:05.633
PROBABLY FOREIGN-MADE.

03:05.633 --> 03:07.267
ON THE OTHER HAND,

03:07.267 --> 03:11.000
SAY WHAT YOU WANT
ABOUT AMERICAN CARS...

03:15.633 --> 03:17.767
BEATS A HOUSE.

03:42.633 --> 03:44.567
- [laughs]

03:52.367 --> 03:57.267
WHAT, DID THEY DRIVE
INTO THE HOUSE?

03:57.267 --> 03:58.900
- YEAH. YEAH.

03:58.900 --> 04:01.567
- WHAT HAPPENED?

04:01.567 --> 04:04.700
- GRANDMA AND GRANDPA
STOPPED BY.

04:13.733 --> 04:15.033
- ROBERT, WHAT DO WE DO?

04:15.033 --> 04:16.367
- WELL, I'LL FILL OUT A REPORT.

04:16.367 --> 04:18.700
YOU SHOULD CALL
YOUR INSURANCE COMPANIES.

04:18.700 --> 04:20.500
- OH, HERE WE GO.

04:20.500 --> 04:24.600
WHY THE HELL
DID I LET YOU DRIVE?

04:24.600 --> 04:27.200
- BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SEE
ANYMORE.

04:28.900 --> 04:31.500
- I CAN SEE A HOUSE!

04:39.533 --> 04:40.667
- OH, MY GOD.

04:40.667 --> 04:42.733
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
DON'T WORRY, DEB.

04:42.733 --> 04:44.133
I'M SURE
THAT DAD'S CAR INSURANCE

04:44.133 --> 04:45.433
WILL COVER THIS.

04:49.033 --> 04:50.667
- I'M NOT SURE
IT'S CURRENT.

04:50.667 --> 04:51.933
[all gasp]

04:51.933 --> 04:54.700
WHAT?
WE NEVER GO ANYWHERE.

04:54.700 --> 04:56.433
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!

04:56.433 --> 04:58.567
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK, DO YOU GUYS
HAVE HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE?

04:58.567 --> 05:00.633
- OKAY, OUR INSURANCE.
GOOD. RIGHT.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.333
OKAY,
WHERE DID I PUT THAT?

05:02.333 --> 05:05.100
HOPEFULLY,
IT'S NOT OVER THERE.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.733
- HEY, HEY, DOG.
GET OUT OF HERE, DOG.

05:12.733 --> 05:14.600
NO, GO AWAY.

05:14.600 --> 05:15.500
- OH, LOOK AT HIM.

05:15.500 --> 05:17.000
LOOK AT HIM.
CAN WE KEEP HIM?

05:17.000 --> 05:18.667
- NO, SWEETIE.
NO.

05:18.667 --> 05:20.400
- WE NEVER GET ANYTHING.

05:20.400 --> 05:23.333
- ALLY,
WE CAN'T KEEP A DOG.

05:23.333 --> 05:25.500
HE'LL JUST RUN AWAY,
OKAY?

05:25.500 --> 05:27.833
JUST--COME ON.

05:27.833 --> 05:29.300
GET HIM OUT.
GO OUT THE BACK.

05:29.300 --> 05:30.900
- OH, YOU SHOULDN'T
LET THEM TAKE THE DOG

05:30.900 --> 05:31.967
THROUGH THE KITCHEN.

05:31.967 --> 05:33.600
HE'LL MAKE A MESS IN THERE.

05:40.333 --> 05:42.967
- OKAY, GOOD.
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE COVERED.

05:42.967 --> 05:44.567
- OH, WONDERFUL.

05:44.567 --> 05:47.000
- YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO PAY
THE DEDUCTIBLE.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.633
- 1,000 BUCKS?
STINKING CROOKS.

05:52.633 --> 05:56.667
ALL RIGHT,
HERE'S WHAT YOU DO.

05:56.667 --> 05:59.267
YOU GET YOUR CONTRACTOR

05:59.267 --> 06:00.933
TO ADD AN EXTRA GRAND
TO THE BILL,

06:00.933 --> 06:02.600
THEN WHEN
YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY

06:02.600 --> 06:05.233
CUTS YOU YOUR CHECK,
I GET IT BACK.

06:05.233 --> 06:08.567
- ALL RIGHT, DAD, LOOK,
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS.

06:08.567 --> 06:11.200
- HEY, DUDLEY DO-RIGHT,
WAKE UP.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.333
THIS IS THE WAY
THE WORLD WORKS.

06:13.333 --> 06:15.467
IT'S BUILT
INTO THE INSURANCE SYSTEM.

06:15.467 --> 06:16.967
- OH, YEAH?

06:16.967 --> 06:20.133
WELL, IT'S ALSO BUILT INTO
THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.

06:20.133 --> 06:22.800
CATEGORY: FRAUD.

06:22.800 --> 06:26.800
- NERD!

06:26.800 --> 06:29.033
- NERD?
- NERD.

06:29.033 --> 06:30.567
- CALLING ME A NERD, HUH?

06:30.567 --> 06:32.400
YOU DRIVE INTO THE HOUSE,
AND NOW I'M A NERD?

06:32.400 --> 06:35.333
YOU'RE CALLING ME A NERD?

06:39.367 --> 06:41.400
- RAY, DO SOMETHING.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.600
- WHAT?

06:42.600 --> 06:43.600
- TELL YOUR FATHER

06:43.600 --> 06:45.033
WE'RE DOING THIS
THE RIGHT WAY.

06:45.033 --> 06:47.033
- HEY, ME NOT HAVING
TO PAY ANYTHING

06:47.033 --> 06:48.433
IS THE RIGHT WAY.

06:48.433 --> 06:53.433
AW, HOLY CRAP.
LOOK AT THIS SCRATCH.

06:53.433 --> 06:55.033
- OKAY, SEE, HERE'S THE THING.

06:55.033 --> 06:59.033
UM, WHEN A PERSON
DRIVES THEIR CAR

06:59.033 --> 07:01.233
INTO SOMEONE'S HOME,

07:01.233 --> 07:04.000
I THINK THAT PERSON
SHOULD BE SYMPATHETIC

07:04.000 --> 07:06.800
AND APOLOGETIC
AND TRY TO HELP

07:06.800 --> 07:09.033
THE PERSON WHOSE HOME
HAS BEEN DEMOLISHED

07:09.033 --> 07:10.867
TRY TO MAKE IT BETTER!

07:10.867 --> 07:14.333
- HEY, I'M TRYING,
BUT YOU WON'T LISTEN.

07:14.333 --> 07:17.633
- I WON'T LISTEN?

07:17.633 --> 07:18.767
- I MUST SAY, DEBRA,

07:18.767 --> 07:22.800
THAT TONE DOESN'T HELP
THE SITUATION.

07:22.800 --> 07:26.267
- MY TONE?
MY TONE?

07:26.267 --> 07:29.333
YOU JUST DROVE A CAR
INTO MY HOUSE!

07:29.333 --> 07:32.333
- I TOLD THE KIDS
TO LEAVE THE BACK DOOR OPEN,

07:32.333 --> 07:35.467
SO YOU GET THAT NICE
CROSS-VENTILATION GOING.

07:39.067 --> 07:42.100
- OKAY, RAY,
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

07:42.100 --> 07:43.633
WILL YOU TALK TO THEM?
YOU TALK TO THEM.

07:43.633 --> 07:45.933
- WHAT DO I SAY?
- WHAT DO YOU SAY?

07:45.933 --> 07:47.667
AREN'T YOU UPSET
ABOUT THIS?

07:47.667 --> 07:50.233
- WATCH THIS.
HE'S GOING TO TAKE HER SIDE NOW.

07:50.233 --> 07:52.367
- WOULD YOU
SAY SOMETHING?

07:52.367 --> 07:54.767
- ONE THING I WILL SAY
ABOUT YOUR FATHER

07:54.767 --> 07:57.233
IS THAT HE'S VERY GOOD
WITH INSURANCE MATTERS.

07:57.233 --> 07:59.233
I MEAN, OVER THE YEARS,

07:59.233 --> 08:01.633
WE'VE HAD OUR SHARE
OF INCIDENTS,

08:01.633 --> 08:04.233
AND WE'VE ALWAYS DONE
VERY WELL.

08:04.233 --> 08:05.767
- IT'S TRUE.

08:05.767 --> 08:07.300
IT IS TRUE.

08:07.300 --> 08:12.667
I HAVE SEEN
SOME INCREDIBLE THINGS.

08:12.667 --> 08:15.167
- FRANK, YOU'RE GOING
TO PAY FOR THIS.

08:15.167 --> 08:16.767
THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.

08:16.767 --> 08:18.367
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

08:18.367 --> 08:20.233
- NO, FRANK, YOU'RE PAYING
THE DEDUCTIBLE.

08:20.233 --> 08:22.000
THAT'S HOW
IT'S GOING TO BE.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.033
- OH, REALLY?

08:25.033 --> 08:26.967
- WHY ARE YOU
JUST STANDING THERE?

08:26.967 --> 08:28.967
- WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

08:28.967 --> 08:30.767
- OH, ALL RIGHT.
THANKS.

08:30.767 --> 08:34.133
- FRANK, I WANT A CHECK
FOR $1,000 BY TOMORROW.

08:34.133 --> 08:35.233
- DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH.

08:35.233 --> 08:38.933
- FRANK, I'M NOT KIDDING.

08:38.933 --> 08:41.933
- FINE.

08:41.933 --> 08:43.467
FINE!

08:43.467 --> 08:46.000
I'LL PAY
THE DAMN DEDUCTIBLE!

08:46.000 --> 08:47.400
APPARENTLY,

08:47.400 --> 08:50.733
ALL YOU PEOPLE
CARE ABOUT IS MONEY!

08:58.333 --> 09:01.033
I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME, MARIE.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.133
[engine turns over]

09:07.200 --> 09:09.200
- OH, WAIT, FRANK, WAIT.

09:09.200 --> 09:12.467
I NEED TO GO
TO THE SUPERMARKET!

09:23.700 --> 09:25.000
- HEY, CRABBY.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.800
- HEY!

09:26.800 --> 09:28.467
COME HERE, COME HERE.

09:28.467 --> 09:30.767
- WHAT?
- THE CONTRACTOR FINISHED.

09:30.767 --> 09:32.033
HUH? HUH?

09:32.033 --> 09:33.733
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

09:33.733 --> 09:37.133
- YEAH, DEFINITELY BETTER
WITH A WALL.

09:37.133 --> 09:39.500
- YEAH, BUT, I MEAN,

09:39.500 --> 09:40.967
DON'T YOU THINK
THEY DID A GREAT JOB?

09:40.967 --> 09:42.500
- YEAH, LOOKS GREAT.

09:42.500 --> 09:44.967
- YEAH, AND YOUR FATHER'S CHECK
DIDN'T BOUNCE.

09:44.967 --> 09:46.633
- SEE?
IT ALL WORKED OUT.

09:46.633 --> 09:50.533
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO GET
SO UPSET.

09:50.533 --> 09:52.233
- I'M JUST HAPPY
IT'S FINISHED.

09:52.233 --> 09:53.900
- YEAH, ME TOO.
YOU KNOW WHY?

09:53.900 --> 09:56.167
BECAUSE NOW THAT
THE WALL IS HERE,

09:56.167 --> 09:58.700
NOBODY CAN SEE ME DO THIS.

10:03.467 --> 10:06.533
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT'S UP WITH THE STRIPES?

10:06.533 --> 10:08.367
- OH, THEY'RE OKAY.
THEY'RE OKAY.

10:08.367 --> 10:12.533
- NO, NO, LOOK, THESE STRIPES,
ARE THEY THE SAME AS THESE?

10:12.533 --> 10:14.067
BECAUSE THESE LOOK
LIKE THINNER STRIPES.

10:14.067 --> 10:15.267
- YEAH, I KNOW,
BUT IT'S CLOSE ENOUGH.

10:15.267 --> 10:16.267
YOU CAN'T EVEN TELL.

10:16.267 --> 10:19.567
- HMM, YEAH. OKAY.

10:20.967 --> 10:22.967
NO, I CAN TELL.
I CAN TELL.

10:22.967 --> 10:25.367
I CAN TELL.
LOOK AT THE OLD WALL.

10:25.367 --> 10:29.100
THESE THIN STRIPES...
THEY'RE THICKER.

10:29.100 --> 10:30.633
IT'S NOT THE SAME.

10:30.633 --> 10:32.033
IT'S NOT THE SAME WALLPAPER.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:32.033 --> 10:33.700
- WELL, NOTHING.
NO, THE PAINTER TOLD ME

10:33.700 --> 10:35.567
THAT THEY DON'T MAKE
OUR WALLPAPER ANYMORE,

10:35.567 --> 10:37.967
AND TO REPRINT THIS ONE WOULD
HAVE BEEN REALLY EXPENSIVE.

10:37.967 --> 10:39.767
- YEAH, BUT THIS ISN'T THE SAME.

10:39.767 --> 10:42.233
- YEAH, BUT, RAY, WE WOULD HAVE
HAD TO PAY MORE.

10:42.233 --> 10:45.133
- NO, WE WOULDN'T HAVE.

10:45.133 --> 10:47.533
MY FATHER WOULD HAVE
HAD TO PAY MORE.

10:47.533 --> 10:50.200
- NO, WE CAN'T BLAME THIS
ON YOUR FATHER.

10:50.200 --> 10:52.800
I TOLD THE WALLPAPER GUY
THAT THIS WAS OKAY.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.467
- WELL, WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

10:54.467 --> 10:56.800
- BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO DEAL
WITH YOUR PARENTS ANYMORE.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.467
- HUH.

10:58.467 --> 11:00.867
SO MY FATHER
GETS AWAY WITH IT,

11:00.867 --> 11:03.067
AND YOU'RE OKAY
WITH THAT.

11:03.067 --> 11:04.867
- YEAH, I'M OKAY WITH THIS.

11:04.867 --> 11:07.967
I WASN'T OKAY WHEN THEY DROVE
THE CAR THROUGH THE HOUSE,

11:07.967 --> 11:10.967
BUT YOU HAVE TO PICK
YOUR BATTLES.

11:10.967 --> 11:14.100
- THIS WALLPAPER'S INCORRECT.
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

11:14.100 --> 11:16.733
STAND 3 FEET BACK.
YOU CAN HARDLY TELL.

11:16.733 --> 11:19.100
- BUT MAYBE I DON'T WANT
TO STAND 3 FEET BACK.

11:19.100 --> 11:20.400
MAYBE I WANT
TO STAND RIGHT HERE

11:20.400 --> 11:23.367
AND LOOK AT MY WALLPAPER,
YOU KNOW?

11:23.367 --> 11:26.100
I MEAN, HERE, LOOK,
HERE'S WALLPAPER,

11:26.100 --> 11:29.133
AND HERE IS
DIFFERENT WALLPAPER.

11:29.133 --> 11:31.600
WHAT WORLD AM I IN?

11:31.600 --> 11:33.567
- RAY, CALM DOWN.

11:33.567 --> 11:38.767
- I WILL NOT CALM DOWN. HUH?
WE LIVE IN A FUNHOUSE HERE!

11:38.767 --> 11:42.100
CARS ARE COMING IN,
AND WILD DOGS WANDERING AROUND,

11:42.100 --> 11:45.600
AND CRAZY WALLPAPER!

11:45.600 --> 11:47.933
- WHY ARE YOU GETTING
SO UPSET ABOUT THIS NOW?

11:47.933 --> 11:50.233
- MY FATHER IS PAYING FOR IT.
- NO, RAY, WE JUST CAN'T--

11:50.233 --> 11:51.700
- NO, NO, LOOK,
DON'T YOU GET IT?

11:51.700 --> 11:53.533
OKAY, SOMEBODY HAS
TO GO OVER THERE AND TELL HIM,

11:53.533 --> 11:55.467
OR THEY'RE JUST GOING TO KEEP
BACKING INTO THE HOUSE.

11:55.467 --> 11:57.600
- WE CAN GET USED
TO THE WALLPAPER.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.733
- NO, NO, NO, LOOK, THEY'RE
GOING TO KNOW I MEAN BUSINESS

11:59.733 --> 12:01.300
'CAUSE BUSINESS IS WHAT I MEAN!
- NO, NO, NO.

12:01.300 --> 12:03.433
- BUSINESS.
- NO, RAY, ARE YOU INSANE?

12:03.433 --> 12:04.700
YOU'RE NOT GOING OVER THERE.

12:04.700 --> 12:05.900
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
A HEART ATTACK.

12:05.900 --> 12:07.233
- I DON'T CARE.

12:07.233 --> 12:08.533
- HOW COME YOU DIDN'T
GET THIS UPSET

12:08.533 --> 12:09.767
WHEN THEY DROVE THE CAR
THROUGH THE HOUSE?

12:09.767 --> 12:11.400
- WHY ARE YOU SIDING WITH THEM?

12:11.400 --> 12:14.567
- I'M NOT SIDING WITH THEM.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.267
- WELL, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME,
SISTER GIRL, OKAY,

12:16.267 --> 12:18.033
'CAUSE MY EYES ARE OPEN
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

12:18.033 --> 12:20.133
- NO, NO, NO, YOU'RE NOT GOING.
- YEAH, TO HELL I'M NOT, OKAY?

12:20.133 --> 12:21.500
THEY HAVE TO KNOW.
- ALL RIGHT, WAIT.

12:21.500 --> 12:22.700
I'LL GO OVER THERE.
- NO!

12:22.700 --> 12:23.967
- NO, RAY, LET ME GO!

12:23.967 --> 12:26.467
- [screams]

12:26.467 --> 12:27.733
- [shushing]

12:27.733 --> 12:31.100
OKAY, I'LL HANDLE THEM.
I'LL HANDLE THEM.

12:31.100 --> 12:32.600
I GOT THE WALL UP,
DIDN'T I?

12:32.600 --> 12:35.167
- YEAH, LOOK AT IT.

12:35.167 --> 12:38.567
- HELLO, DEAR.

12:38.567 --> 12:40.033
HI, RAYMOND.

12:40.033 --> 12:42.667
- UH-HUH.
HMM?

12:45.300 --> 12:47.267
- I MISSED YOU, RAYMOND.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.367
I WANTED TO CALL.
I WANTED TO COME OVER.

12:49.367 --> 12:52.533
BUT, YOU KNOW,
YOUR FATHER'S IMPOSSIBLE.

12:52.533 --> 12:55.400
- I'M NOT HERE.

12:55.400 --> 12:58.633
I JUST WANTED TO SEE
THE WALL I BOUGHT.

12:58.633 --> 13:00.800
- OH...GOOD.

13:00.800 --> 13:03.100
GOOD, BECAUSE WE WANTED
TO SHOW IT TO YOU.

13:03.100 --> 13:04.933
- OH, GOOD.
I'D LIKE TO SEE IT TOO.

13:04.933 --> 13:08.767
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THE MONEY
THESE HUMPS GET TO DO THIS.

13:08.767 --> 13:10.367
- GO. GO. GO.

13:10.367 --> 13:13.667
- THAT'S ACTUALLY FUNNY
BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT

13:13.667 --> 13:17.000
THAT THE NEW WALLPAPER
DOESN'T EXACTLY MATCH,

13:17.000 --> 13:20.800
SO IT MIGHT COST
MORE MONEY TO FIX IT.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.667
- COST WHO MORE?

13:22.667 --> 13:26.600
- UM, UH,
WE WERE THINKING...

13:26.600 --> 13:29.100
YOU.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.967
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I'M NOT GOING TO PAY ANYTHING.

13:31.967 --> 13:34.833
THE WALLPAPER'S FINE.
- I WANT IT THE SAME!

13:34.833 --> 13:36.500
DO YOU HEAR ME?

13:36.500 --> 13:41.367
EXACTLY, EXACTLY THE SAME,
AND I MEAN EXACTLY THE SAME!

13:41.367 --> 13:43.200
YOU CAN ONLY PUSH A MAN
SO FAR.

13:43.200 --> 13:45.033
- RAY, IT'S NOT THAT BIG
OF A DEAL--CALM DOWN.

13:45.033 --> 13:48.433
- TRAITOR!

13:48.433 --> 13:50.567
YOU CAN NEVER TALK TO ME
ABOUT MY PARENTS AGAIN

13:50.567 --> 13:55.000
BECAUSE, IN THIS CASE,
YOU ARE THE BACKER-DOWNER.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.833
- THIS WALLPAPER LOOKS JUST
LIKE THE OTHER WALLPAPER.

13:56.833 --> 13:58.700
- YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT, MOM.
IT'S NOT, OKAY?

13:58.700 --> 14:01.467
HERE, COME ON. LET'S SEE.
LET'S SEE. COME OVER HERE.

14:01.467 --> 14:04.100
AND LOOK, SEE, OVER HERE,
OVER HERE,

14:04.100 --> 14:05.233
THICK, NORMAL STRIPES.

14:05.233 --> 14:06.467
NOW LOOK OVER HERE,

14:06.467 --> 14:08.567
THIN, WEIRD,
DISGUSTING STRIPES.

14:08.567 --> 14:09.767
OKAY? ALL RIGHT.

14:09.767 --> 14:11.367
I'M NOT GOING TO LIVE
LIKE THIS,

14:11.367 --> 14:13.567
SO I THINK YOU
AND YOUR HUSBAND

14:13.567 --> 14:15.900
SHOULD LISTEN
VERY CAREFULLY, ALL RIGHT?

14:15.900 --> 14:18.800
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE
TO PAY THE DIFFERENCE.

14:18.800 --> 14:20.033
YOU UNDERSTAND?

14:20.033 --> 14:22.767
- SUCK ROPE, PAL.

14:25.367 --> 14:27.467
- THAT'S IT.
GET OUT OF THE HOUSE.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.967
- RAYMOND!
- THAT--GET OUT. GET OUT, HUH?

14:29.967 --> 14:31.167
YEAH, THE BOTH OF YOU.

14:31.167 --> 14:32.300
TAKE YOUR DAMN CANNOLIS
WITH YOU.

14:32.300 --> 14:33.733
- OH, RAYMOND!
- OUT. OUT.

14:33.733 --> 14:36.900
- THIS IS HOW YOU TALK
TO A FATHER...AND HER?

14:36.900 --> 14:39.867
- YEAH.

14:39.867 --> 14:42.000
START WALKING, ALL RIGHT,
BECAUSE I'VE HAD IT.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.833
- RAY, THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
ABOUT THE WALLPAPER.

14:43.833 --> 14:46.400
- I DON'T CARE, ALL RIGHT?
IT'S OVER. GOOD DAY.

14:46.400 --> 14:50.933
- RAYMOND.
- I SAID GOOD DAY.

14:50.933 --> 14:52.233
- LET'S GO, MARIE.

14:52.233 --> 14:55.167
ONE LESS FUNERAL
WE GOT TO GO TO.

14:55.167 --> 14:57.733
- FRANK,
WE'RE OLDER THAN THEM.

14:57.733 --> 15:01.500
- FINE, THEN DON'T COME
TO MY FUNERAL.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.133
- I'M COMING.
I'M COMING.

15:03.133 --> 15:06.600
I'LL BE THE ONE DOING THIS, HUH?
YEAH. YEAH?

15:06.600 --> 15:08.133
GO. GET OUT.
- NO, RAY, STOP THIS.

15:08.133 --> 15:10.500
- WHY?
- NO.

15:10.500 --> 15:12.267
- HI.

15:12.267 --> 15:17.067
IS THIS ABOUT ME?

15:17.067 --> 15:19.567
- DON'T COME TO MY FUNERAL!

15:19.567 --> 15:23.367
- BUT THERE ARE SO FEW THINGS
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO.

15:26.233 --> 15:28.433
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:28.433 --> 15:31.033
- YOUR BROTHER'S
THROWING US OUT.

15:31.033 --> 15:32.300
- AND YOU'RE REALLY GOING?

15:32.300 --> 15:35.567
- YEP. YEAH. IT'S A NEW DAY.
GET OUT.

15:35.567 --> 15:37.500
- NO, STOP.
WE'RE NOT DOING THIS.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.267
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
THIS IS WHAT YOU ALWAYS WANTED.

15:39.267 --> 15:40.800
- I DID--NEVER WANTED THIS.
THIS IS TERRIBLE.

15:40.800 --> 15:42.933
EVERYBODY, COME ON IN.
COME ON IN, AND SIT DOWN.

15:42.933 --> 15:44.867
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I'M GETTING THE CAR!

15:44.867 --> 15:47.967
- NO, FRANK, SIT DOWN.

15:47.967 --> 15:49.733
EVERYBODY, SIT DOWN.
MARIE, YOU TOO.

15:49.733 --> 15:51.367
- I'M NOT SURE
I WANT TO SIT DOWN.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.233
I'M NOT SURE I'M WELCOME
IN THIS HOUSE.

15:53.233 --> 15:54.467
- OH, YEAH, YOU'RE PICKING UP
ON THAT?

15:54.467 --> 15:57.300
- ALL RIGHT, RAY!
SIT DOWN.

15:57.300 --> 15:59.333
- NO. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- SIT.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.300
- I CAN'T THROW THEM OUT
IF THEY'RE SITTING.

16:01.300 --> 16:03.467
- ALL RIGHT.
SIT DOWN.

16:03.467 --> 16:05.200
- HEY, THE WALL LOOKS GOOD.

16:05.200 --> 16:06.667
- NO, IT DOESN'T, HUH?

16:06.667 --> 16:08.233
CAN'T YOU SEE?
LOOK AT THE STRIPES, YOU IDIOT.

16:08.233 --> 16:10.733
- ALL RIGHT, RAY,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

16:10.733 --> 16:12.167
OKAY, LISTEN.

16:12.167 --> 16:15.367
THIS IS REALLY NOT
ABOUT THE WALLPAPER STRIPES.

16:15.367 --> 16:16.833
- YES, IT IS!
- NO, RAY--

16:16.833 --> 16:18.467
- WHAT, I DON'T HAVE
THE RIGHT TO BE ANGRY?

16:18.467 --> 16:21.100
- YES, HONEY, EVERYBODY
HAS THE RIGHT TO BE ANGRY,

16:21.100 --> 16:24.800
BUT LET'S TRY SOMETHING,
OKAY?

16:24.800 --> 16:27.400
MAYBE IT WOULD HELP US,

16:27.400 --> 16:29.967
FOR NOW AND IN THE FUTURE,

16:29.967 --> 16:32.367
FOR YOU TO TELL US

16:32.367 --> 16:34.367
IN A CALM AND ADULT MANNER

16:34.367 --> 16:36.567
WHY YOU'RE REALLY UPSET.

16:36.567 --> 16:40.767
ONCE AND FOR ALL, RAY,
TELL THEM WHY.

16:44.333 --> 16:48.767
- IT'S THE WALLPAPER.
IT'S THE WALLPAPER.

16:48.767 --> 16:50.033
THE STRIPES ARE TOO THIN,

16:50.033 --> 16:51.233
AND THEY WERE JUST
GOING TO LET IT GO

16:51.233 --> 16:52.700
LIKE IT DOESN'T MATTER.

16:52.700 --> 16:55.700
- HE DOESN'T LIKE
HIS WALLPAPER.

16:55.700 --> 16:57.733
- NO, NO, THE WALLPAPER
WAS THE LAST STRAW.

16:57.733 --> 17:01.333
- GOOD, GOOD. SEE?
SEE, THERE'S THE PROBLEM.

17:01.333 --> 17:02.867
YOU JUST SAID "LAST STRAW,"

17:02.867 --> 17:05.567
WHICH MEANS THERE'S BEEN
A LOT OF OTHER STRAWS.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.167
- LOT OF STRAWS?
THERE'S A LOT OF STRAWS.

17:07.167 --> 17:10.567
- YEAH, OKAY.
OKAY.

17:10.567 --> 17:15.667
SO--BUT YOU'VE JUST BEEN
KEEPING IT ALL BOTTLED UP INSIDE

17:15.667 --> 17:18.967
UNTIL JUST NOW, WHEN YOU WENT
BANANAS ABOUT WALLPAPER.

17:18.967 --> 17:21.533
- VERY UNHEALTHY, CUBBY.

17:21.533 --> 17:24.733
- RIGHT. RIGHT.
SO, HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:24.733 --> 17:26.967
LET'S USE THIS EVENT

17:26.967 --> 17:29.667
AS AN OPPORTUNITY
FOR ALL OF US

17:29.667 --> 17:32.967
TO LEARN HOW
TO TALK THINGS OUT, YOU KNOW,

17:32.967 --> 17:35.233
SO WE DON'T LET OUR FEELINGS
GET ALL BOTTLED UP INSIDE

17:35.233 --> 17:37.800
TO THE POINT
WHERE THEY EXPLODE.

17:37.800 --> 17:40.100
- YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

17:40.100 --> 17:43.100
FRANK, YOU'RE DRIVING
EVERYBODY CRAZY.

17:45.167 --> 17:46.367
- IT'S YOU TOO.

17:46.367 --> 17:49.733
- WHAT?
WHAT DID I EVER DO?

17:52.133 --> 17:53.900
- YOU'RE INTRUSIVE.

17:53.900 --> 17:58.900
- INTERESTING.

17:58.900 --> 18:00.467
- HOW AM I INTRUSIVE?

18:00.467 --> 18:03.133
- WELL, FOR EXAMPLE,
THERE WAS THAT TIME

18:03.133 --> 18:07.933
YOU DROVE A CAR
THROUGH THE WALL.

18:07.933 --> 18:10.633
- ONE TIME.

18:10.633 --> 18:12.500
- OKAY, SO IT'S NOT
ALWAYS THE CAR,

18:12.500 --> 18:15.967
BUT IT'S ALWAYS...YOU.

18:15.967 --> 18:17.267
YOU JUST--
YOU NEVER STOP.

18:17.267 --> 18:19.033
YOU'RE ALWAYS BARGING
IN HERE.

18:19.033 --> 18:20.333
- OH, I DO NOT BARGE IN.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.900
- YOU DO. YOU DO.
YOU BARGE IN HERE.

18:21.900 --> 18:26.100
- ALL RIGHT, RAY, RAY,
LET'S TRY TO USE NICE WORDS.

18:26.100 --> 18:28.867
- YOU'RE ALWAYS...

18:28.867 --> 18:31.000
COMING OVER,

18:31.000 --> 18:34.233
STICKING YOUR--
- NICE, NICE.

18:34.233 --> 18:39.133
- AND STAYING...A LONG TIME.

18:40.767 --> 18:44.300
- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST SAY SOMETHING?

18:48.867 --> 18:51.400
- I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING,

18:51.400 --> 18:53.767
BUT SOMETIMES
I GET THE FEELING

18:53.767 --> 18:56.167
THAT YOU DON'T LISTEN,

18:56.167 --> 19:00.367
AND THEN YOU DO SOMETHING
LIKE REAR-END OUR COUCH.

19:00.367 --> 19:04.333
AND--AND I WANT TO SAY
SOMETHING THEN TOO,

19:04.333 --> 19:07.000
BUT I KNOW THAT
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LISTEN,

19:07.000 --> 19:08.933
AND DAD IS NOT GOING
TO WANT TO PAY,

19:08.933 --> 19:11.267
AND I KNOW DEBRA'S
GOING TO GET MAD AT ME

19:11.267 --> 19:13.200
BECAUSE I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.800
BUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW

19:14.800 --> 19:18.700
THAT I'M ALWAYS THIS CLOSE
TO SAYING SOMETHING,

19:18.700 --> 19:20.233
THIS CLOSE.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.200
AND THERE IT IS.

19:35.433 --> 19:40.067
SO THAT'S
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY.

19:40.067 --> 19:45.600
- WOW.
RAY, THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.

19:49.433 --> 19:54.733
- OH, OH, HONEY,
I UNDERSTAND.

19:54.733 --> 19:59.000
- GOOD. GOOD. SEE?
NOW, THIS IS PROGRESS.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.733
- YES, RAYMOND, DEAR,

20:01.733 --> 20:04.000
YOU JUST HAVE TO LET US KNOW
WHEN YOU WANT SOMETHING,

20:04.000 --> 20:05.467
THAT'S ALL.

20:05.467 --> 20:10.167
- YEAH, WE'RE NOT MIND READERS.

20:10.167 --> 20:12.400
- AND THAT WAY,
YOU NEVER HAVE TO SHOUT AT US

20:12.400 --> 20:16.600
BECAUSE THAT REALLY
IS UNPLEASANT.

20:16.600 --> 20:19.367
- I'M SORRY
ABOUT THE SHOUTING.

20:19.367 --> 20:23.467
- THAT'S RIGHT, PAL.
NO SHOUTING.

20:23.467 --> 20:24.800
- I GOT IT.

20:24.800 --> 20:29.100
- GOOD. OKAY, SO GOOD.
WHAT DID WE LEARN HERE TODAY?

20:29.100 --> 20:31.567
- HE SHOULDN'T SHOUT.

20:31.567 --> 20:35.667
- YES, BUT ALSO
THAT WE SHOULD LEARN

20:35.667 --> 20:37.133
TO RESPECT EACH OTHER

20:37.133 --> 20:41.133
AND BE CONSIDERATE
OF EACH OTHER, RIGHT?

20:41.133 --> 20:44.833
- I GUESS SO.
- YES. OH, GOOD.

20:44.833 --> 20:48.600
OH, ISN'T THIS NICE?

20:48.600 --> 20:51.367
- YOU KNOW, IF I MAY,
I HAVE SOME ISSUES THAT--

20:51.367 --> 20:54.900
- THAT'S ENOUGH TALK, ROBBIE.

20:54.900 --> 20:56.700
HAVE A CANNOLI, RAYMOND.

21:00.933 --> 21:02.533
- [clicks tongue]

21:09.733 --> 21:11.267
HEY, HERE'S THE ITALY TAPE.
IS STEFANIA ON HERE?

21:11.267 --> 21:12.500
- HEY, PUT IT IN.
- UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:12.500 --> 21:14.000
YOU'RE WELCOME
TO BORROW THAT,

21:14.000 --> 21:15.567
IF YOU WANT TO WATCH IT
AT YOUR HOUSE.

21:15.567 --> 21:18.133
- NO, IT'D BE SUCH FUN
TO WATCH IT ALL TOGETHER.

21:18.133 --> 21:19.933
- HEY, LOOK,
THERE'S THE GELATO PLACE.

21:19.933 --> 21:21.400
- I'M THIRSTY.
HEY, SWEETIE,

21:21.400 --> 21:22.800
HOW 'BOUT SOME ICED TEA?

21:22.800 --> 21:24.200
- THAT WOULD BE LOVELY.

21:26.367 --> 21:28.333
- OKAY. I'LL GET IT.

21:28.333 --> 21:30.667
RAY, COULD I SEE YOU,
PLEASE?

21:34.100 --> 21:37.167
THEY ARE CLUELESS.
ABSOLUTELY CLUELESS.

21:37.167 --> 21:38.567
I-I MEAN, I DON'T
KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.

21:38.567 --> 21:40.400
- WELL, IT'S OKAY.
LOOK, WE TALKED IT OUT.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.067
IT'LL BE FINE--
THEY'LL WATCH THE TAPE,

21:42.067 --> 21:43.067
AND THEN THEY'LL GO.

21:43.067 --> 21:45.100
- ICED TEA!

21:47.533 --> 21:48.967
- SO ARE YOU GOING
TO GET THAT FOR THEM?

21:48.967 --> 21:51.500
'CAUSE I COULD
USE ONE TOO.
