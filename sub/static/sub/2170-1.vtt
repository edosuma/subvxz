here's your toast.

Why doesn't Daddy
go to church with us?

34:04.800 --> 34:07.644
Legend has it, your daddy used
to go before we were married.

34:07.720 --> 34:09.768
Did Grandma make you go
when you were little?

34:10.560 --> 34:13.688
I go Christmas and Easter. Doesn't
that pretty much cover it, anyway?

34:13.760 --> 34:15.400

go wait for me in the car.

34:15.800 --> 34:17.040

34:17.120 --> 34:18.326

34:29.480 --> 34:30.766

Are you sure?

34:33.800 --> 34:34.926
Yeah.

34:37.080 --> 34:38.241
When did you find out?

34:38.320 --> 34:39.481
A week ago.

34:39.920 --> 34:42.844

Why didn't you tell me?

34:44.960 --> 34:47.531

It's okay.

you're not here.

It's the second time
you've called me Father.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.729
I was an altar boy
at Saint Ignatius.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.369
What makes you think
the case is still open?

37:07.440 --> 37:08.521
Well, I went to the zoo

37:08.600 --> 37:11.126
and asked them to let me see the
security camera recordings,

37:11.200 --> 37:13.920
and they told me only the arresting
officers had permission for that.

37:14.280 --> 37:15.486
Why do you want to
see the recordings?

37:15.560 --> 37:17.403
To help me determine
why Jane did it.

37:17.480 --> 37:18.845
I can save you the time.

37:18.920 --> 37:21.240
The reason she hurt her kid is
because she's fucking crazy,

37:21.280 --> 37:23.240
and now, she's in the loony
bin where she belongs.

37:23.360 --> 37:24.566
Jane Crenna is no lunatic.

37:24.640 --> 37:25.880
You kidding me?
I was there.

37:25.960 --> 37:27.325
And I've known
her for years.

37:27.400 --> 37:29.402
Well, how do you
explain what she did?

37:29.840 --> 37:30.880
That's not the issue here.

37:30.920 --> 37:31.921
I just want to
see the recordings.

37:32.000 --> 37:36.085
No, you explain to me why
you think she's not crazy.

37:36.640 --> 37:41.521
I believe Jane's problem
to be spiritual in nature.

37:41.640 --> 37:42.846

two types of evil

Officer Sarchie.

37:48.360 --> 37:50.806
Secondary evil,
the evil that men do.

37:50.880 --> 37:52.325
I'm sure you
know all about that.

37:52.600 --> 37:54.011
I've seen enough.

37:54.080 --> 37:56.128
And primary evil,

37:56.200 --> 37:57.531
which is something
else entirely.

37:57.760 --> 37:58.886
Meaning what?

37:58.960 --> 38:00.849
I'm sure you remember
that in Catholic teaching,

38:00.920 --> 38:05.801
there are very specific signs that
indicate the presence of an evil spirit.

38:05.880 --> 38:08.531
Well, Jane is demonstrating
many of them.

38:11.160 --> 38:13.049
You think she's possessed?

38:14.560 --> 38:17.370
I'm sorry, Padre, but I
think it's ridiculous

38:17.480 --> 38:20.529
to blame invisible fairies
for the bad shit people do.

38:20.600 --> 38:23.001
Okay? I've seen
some horrible things

38:23.080 --> 38:25.321
but nothing that can't be
explained by human nature.

38:26.880 --> 38:28.564
Then you haven't
seen true evil.

38:31.680 --> 38:34.570
Look, Officer, I'm only here
because I care about Jane.

38:35.560 --> 38:38.404

strange or inexplicable

38:38.480 --> 38:42.166
on those recordings, please call me.

38:56.720 --> 38:58.165
Both he and our
wife-beater Jimmy

38:58.240 --> 39:00.004
served in Griggs'
platoon in Iraq.

39:00.080 --> 39:01.525
All three were
dishonorably discharged.

39:01.600 --> 39:02.681
Why?

39:03.040 --> 39:04.480
They attacked
the battalion chaplain.

39:05.200 --> 39:06.200
Chaplain?

39:06.280 --> 39:07.361
Yeah, they cut
him up pretty good.

39:07.440 --> 39:09.204
All three served time
in the brig at Quantico

39:09.280 --> 39:10.281
before the Corps
cut them loose.

39:10.360 --> 39:12.931
So does the Corps got a home
address on record for Santino?

39:13.000 --> 39:15.287
Nope, just an old PO box
that's no longer his.

39:15.680 --> 39:16.841

39:16.920 --> 39:17.921

at the zoo was theirs.

quarts of paint thinner

39:28.640 --> 39:31.166
with no sign he was forced.

39:32.040 --> 39:34.247
Now, he didn't wrap himself
up in the drop cloth,

39:34.320 --> 39:36.368
and Santino was
the only one down there.

39:39.720 --> 39:44.965
So, Santino watches Griggs kill
himself down in the basement.

39:45.760 --> 39:50.004
Then later watches Griggs'
wife try and kill her own kid?

39:50.080 --> 39:51.445

occupied the Middle East.

the problem of good?

for you to hear.

01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:59.484
My first year in
the priesthood,

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:01.369
I met a young single
mother named Claudia.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.841
She was brand-new in NA.

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.843
She had grown up
Catholic in Venezuela

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:08.446
and was convinced that there was
an evil presence in her home

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:10.210
here in the Bronx.

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:14.126
As her priest, I began a ritual
cleansing of the apartment,

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:16.123
not because l believed
that she was right,

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.328
but because I thought it
might put her mind at ease.

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:21.767
What happened
during that cleansing

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:23.729
changed me forever.

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:26.050
It was actually
the event that started me

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:37.526
I now believe there was an evil
presence in Claudia's house,

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.604
because I watched it try to take
possession of her daughter.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.844
