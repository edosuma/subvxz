00:13.847 --> 00:15.549
Thom:
Do you know this play?

00:15.583 --> 00:17.651
"Death of a Salesman"
by Arthur Miller.

00:17.685 --> 00:20.788
The most depressing
three hours you'll ever
spend in a theater.

00:20.821 --> 00:23.691
Miserable guy
in a miserable job
kills himself.

00:23.724 --> 00:26.660
The miserable end.
Thanks, Arthur.
Thank you.

00:26.694 --> 00:30.198
Thanks for reminding me
all comes to shit, because
I didn't know that.

00:30.231 --> 00:33.601
Thoughts of tragedy
don't occupy my mind
24 hours a day.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.469
You want tragedy?
I can write you tragedy.

00:35.503 --> 00:38.739
Tragedy is easy.
Make me forget it's all
a tragedy.

00:38.772 --> 00:41.409
Make me laugh at the misery.
Then you deserve an award.

00:41.442 --> 00:44.578
Ooh, Arthur Miller.
Fuck you, Arthur Miller!

00:44.612 --> 00:48.416
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

00:48.449 --> 00:50.718
* If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands *

00:50.751 --> 00:53.621
* If you're
happy and you know it,
then motherfucking show it *

00:53.654 --> 00:56.557
* If you're happy
and you know it, clap your
motherfucking hands *

00:56.590 --> 01:00.628
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands! *

01:00.661 --> 01:01.929
Thom:
So I'm on the train

01:01.962 --> 01:04.498
and this jackass next to me
is reading the "Times."

01:04.532 --> 01:08.102
- "The New York Times"?
- Yeah, the fucking
"New York Times."

01:08.136 --> 01:10.371
- And how does that
make him a jackass?
- 'Cause he's reading the news.

01:10.404 --> 01:13.174
- News is for suckers.
- Yeah, because this jackass

01:13.207 --> 01:14.775
thinks he needs
to know about Syria.

01:14.808 --> 01:16.477
So now I'm looking
over his shoulder.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.446
Now I think I need
to know about Syria

01:18.479 --> 01:21.349
and it fucks up my whole day
'cause I'm trying to solve it
and fix it.

01:21.382 --> 01:22.783
So information
makes you a sucker?

01:22.816 --> 01:25.119
It's not information.
It's distraction.

01:25.153 --> 01:27.188
I'm so glad
I rented that barn.

01:27.221 --> 01:29.490
Just needed to get away
from this world.

01:29.523 --> 01:32.126
- To the barn.
- To the barn.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.862
That's exactly why
I became a Buddhist.

01:34.895 --> 01:37.398
- Ahem, wait.
A Buddhist?
- A Buddhist.

01:37.431 --> 01:40.734
- Since when are you a Buddhist?
- Since when? Since fuck you,
how about that?

01:40.768 --> 01:43.771
If you're a Buddhist,
you're the angriest
Buddhist in the world.

01:43.804 --> 01:46.407
Good for you, Barry.
Self-improvement.
I admire it.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.142
- Thank you.
- Yes, exactly.

01:48.176 --> 01:49.610
Oh, come--
why is religion

01:49.643 --> 01:51.612
automatically
self-improvement?

01:51.645 --> 01:53.881
Why is it not
a decline?

01:53.914 --> 01:55.683
Maybe it's failure.
Maybe it's surrender.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.751
Well, you obviously
don't know shit
about Buddhism.

01:57.785 --> 02:00.521
- You're a very
angry Buddhist, Barry.
- I'm not angry, shithead.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.390
- I'm present.
- Well, you're here.

02:02.423 --> 02:05.493
I'm present.
I'm more present
than you, asshole, okay?

02:05.526 --> 02:06.894
I'm present
like a motherfucker.

02:06.927 --> 02:09.663
Okay?
Listen, I'm a lawyer
for the family court.

02:09.697 --> 02:12.800
I mean, I left a city job,
followed my dream,

02:12.833 --> 02:14.402
tried to be
some sort of hero,
and it's what?

02:14.435 --> 02:16.937
It's one failure at life
and love after the next one.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.173
And my job
barely makes a dent.

02:19.207 --> 02:22.243
I mean, at this point
it's either Buddhism or heroin.

02:22.276 --> 02:24.912
Acceptance of misery.
Life is endless suffering.

02:24.945 --> 02:26.847
Maybe I should
become a Buddhist.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.650
Hey, Buddhists
don't fuck around, okay?
Buddhists call bullshit.

02:29.683 --> 02:31.319
And let's face it,
life is fucking bullshit.

02:31.352 --> 02:33.787
So it's kind of like
organized misery.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.723
Well, it's better
than disorganized misery.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.591
Barry:
Let me tell you
something, adman.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.327
That's Buddhism's tagline--
"Fuck it."

02:39.360 --> 02:40.794
- "Buddhism: Fuck it."
- ( laughing )

02:40.828 --> 02:42.930
I mean, it's all
a pile of shit anyway.

02:42.963 --> 02:45.299
I didn't know Buddhism
had a tagline.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.201
Well, you heard it
from me.

02:47.235 --> 02:48.736
Christianity doesn't
have a tagline.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.704
Sure, it does.
"You fucked up."

02:50.738 --> 02:53.607
"Christianity:
You fucked up."

02:53.641 --> 02:55.476
Jews, it's just,
"We're fucked."

02:55.509 --> 02:57.278
Well, that's what you get
for killing Jesus.

02:57.311 --> 02:58.979
( all laugh )

02:59.012 --> 03:01.715
Thom:
A strange thing happens
when you hit your 40s.

03:04.485 --> 03:06.454
Things start falling apart.

03:07.988 --> 03:10.391
Suddenly everyone
is splitting up.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.461
They're dropping dead.

03:14.862 --> 03:18.366
And so you start
to think about death...

03:18.399 --> 03:20.734
and how you're
spending your life.

03:22.903 --> 03:26.440
And if you're
spending it well or...

03:26.474 --> 03:29.477
just spending it.

03:29.510 --> 03:33.581
There's a famous Buddhist,
Thich Nhat Hanh,

03:33.614 --> 03:36.517
and he says you shouldn't
worry about death.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.987
He says, "Clouds don't worry
about becoming rain."

03:40.020 --> 03:42.390
But clouds
don't have kids, Thich.

03:42.423 --> 03:45.493
Clouds don't have to worry
about burying their cloud kids

03:45.526 --> 03:47.995
or their cloud kids
burying them.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.897
You know who else
doesn't have kids?

03:49.930 --> 03:51.665
Thich Nhat fucking Hanh.

03:51.699 --> 03:54.335
Julius:
Dad?

03:54.368 --> 03:55.536
Hey, buddy.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.938
We didn't do hugs.

03:57.971 --> 03:59.940
I thought you were sleeping,
you lunatic.

03:59.973 --> 04:02.810
- What are you doing up?
- Come up.

04:02.843 --> 04:05.879
- I'm so late, buddy.
- But it's so early.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.749
Not early enough.
Time to make the doughnuts.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.751
You're making doughnuts?

04:10.784 --> 04:13.521
- ( engine starts )
- Just a joke.

04:13.554 --> 04:14.788
Oh.

04:14.822 --> 04:16.924
But we didn't do hugs!

04:16.957 --> 04:19.693
I'm so late.
Extra hugs later, okay?

04:19.727 --> 04:22.062
- Okay.
- Okay. Love you!

04:22.095 --> 04:24.665
- Love you!
- Love you, buddy!

04:24.698 --> 04:26.300
Love you, Dad!

04:28.101 --> 04:30.471
Love you, Dada!

04:32.806 --> 04:35.676
- ( bell rings )
- Woman: Yeah, sure.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.911
( bell chimes )

04:37.945 --> 04:40.548
( music blaring
on headphones )

04:46.954 --> 04:50.458
- ( train squeals )
- ( Thom sighs )

05:02.703 --> 05:04.438
He dies in the end.

05:09.443 --> 05:11.379
Comes back, though.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.583
( sighs )

05:35.603 --> 05:37.004
Oh.

05:46.614 --> 05:48.482
Oh.

05:48.516 --> 05:50.718
Motherfuck!

05:50.751 --> 05:54.522
* One Saturday I took
a walk to Zipperhead *

05:54.555 --> 05:57.625
* I met a girl there
and she almost knocked
me dead *

05:57.658 --> 05:59.593
* Punk rock girl,
please look at me *

05:59.627 --> 06:01.762
* Punk rock girl,
what do you see? *

06:01.795 --> 06:03.397
* Let's travel
round the world *

06:03.431 --> 06:06.934
* Just you and me,
punk rock girl. *

06:15.208 --> 06:17.511
- ( thuds,
wheels screeching )
- Woman: Whoa!

06:19.580 --> 06:21.615
( woman #2 groans )

06:21.649 --> 06:25.519
I swear to God,
it's like they know
when I'm wearing a new outfit.

06:25.553 --> 06:28.989
Or when I have
an early meeting.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.159
That's weird.

06:32.192 --> 06:34.161
The train stopped
just outside the station.

06:34.194 --> 06:36.964
Mm, nothing weird
about these trains anymore.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.636
- ( train hisses )
- ( all groan )

06:42.670 --> 06:45.639
- Oh, God.
- ( murmuring )

06:45.673 --> 06:47.841
- Marvelous.
- Fuck.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.577
Every fucking day.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.912
And then they charge you
an arm and a leg.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.614
( clicks tongue )

06:56.750 --> 06:58.586
Marvelous.

06:58.619 --> 07:01.188
* I used to be
an optimist *

07:01.221 --> 07:03.591
* Never made any promises

07:03.624 --> 07:06.226
* Never made
any promises *

07:06.259 --> 07:08.796
* Never made any promises

07:08.829 --> 07:10.931
* I used to be
an optimist *

07:10.964 --> 07:13.801
- * Never made
any promises... *
- ( knocking on door )

07:13.834 --> 07:16.069
* Never made any promises

07:16.103 --> 07:20.941
* Never made
any promises... *

07:20.974 --> 07:24.545
- ( shuts music off )
- ( knocking continues )

07:24.578 --> 07:26.213
Hey.

07:26.246 --> 07:27.881
Walter, hi.
Come in.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.149
- Hi, Lee.
- Come in, it's freezing.

07:29.182 --> 07:30.951
- ( whimpering )
- Hi, Munchkin.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.220
I just wanted
to make sure

07:33.253 --> 07:35.556
everything's okay
on your first day.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.558
- Oh, it's perfect.
- I don't want to
disturb your work.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.560
No, not at all.

07:39.593 --> 07:42.162
It's a bit cold
with the heater out.

07:42.195 --> 07:44.031
I called
the gas company--

07:44.064 --> 07:45.566
Oh, it's fine.
It's fine.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.968
- ( stammers )
- No, I could not be happier.

07:48.001 --> 07:51.505
- Do you want some tea?
- Sure.

07:51.539 --> 07:54.241
I mean, honestly,
I could not love
this place any more.

07:54.274 --> 07:56.977
It's just--
it's exactly
what I needed.

07:57.010 --> 07:59.179
You know?
Just to get away.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.915
No Wi-Fi, no cell,
just away.

08:01.949 --> 08:04.585
You know, this is
kind of exactly why
we moved to Woodstock

08:04.618 --> 08:05.886
in the first place,
you know?

08:05.919 --> 08:09.523
Just to get away
from people, from noise,

08:09.557 --> 08:12.125
from all that suffocating
culture, you know?

08:12.159 --> 08:14.928
"Must see this,"
"must buy that."

08:14.962 --> 08:16.630
You know, movies,

08:16.664 --> 08:20.734
television, news.

08:20.768 --> 08:22.502
You know?

08:23.236 --> 08:26.774
All those prying eyes.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.043
So...

08:30.077 --> 08:31.745
- Here you go.
- Uh...

08:31.779 --> 08:33.714
well, it's a special place.

08:35.115 --> 08:38.185
This used to be
your studio?

08:38.218 --> 08:40.688
Are you from New York?

08:40.721 --> 08:42.155
Uh, Long Island.

08:42.189 --> 08:43.557
- You know...
- Oh.

08:43.591 --> 08:46.827
Jewish self-loathing,
Holocaust,

08:46.860 --> 08:50.297
theological ambivalence,
disappointment to my mother--
the whole shebang.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.132
( laughs )

08:54.067 --> 08:56.003
Mm.

08:58.739 --> 09:00.908
Mm, well,
you know what, Walter?

09:00.941 --> 09:03.043
I think-- I only have
a couple more hours,
so I think I'm--

09:03.076 --> 09:05.579
I should-- I think
I'm just gonna get
back to work.

09:05.613 --> 09:09.216
But thank you so much
for stopping.

09:09.249 --> 09:12.753
I lost most of my family
in the camps.

09:14.021 --> 09:16.223
Oh, my gosh.
Uh, I'm so sorry.

09:16.256 --> 09:17.825
I didn't mean to--

09:17.858 --> 09:20.794
The death camps.

09:20.828 --> 09:22.663
Right.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.832
Yeah, in Poland.

09:24.865 --> 09:26.333
Oh, f--
yeah, of course.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.802
Well, who didn't
back then, huh?

09:28.836 --> 09:30.804
Oh, yeah.

09:30.838 --> 09:32.606
Eh, life goes on.

09:32.640 --> 09:36.677
Life goes on.
Life-- life goes on.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.779
- Ah.
- Not for
my parents, though.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.349
No.

09:42.382 --> 09:45.085
My mother died in Auschwitz
in the gas chambers.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.386
Ah, uh-huh.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.288
My father didn't,
though.

09:48.321 --> 09:50.157
- No?
- No, no.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.960
The typhoid.
Bergen-Belsen.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.628
Oh, right.
Oh, yeah.

09:54.662 --> 09:57.297
My sister-- I mean,
my oldest sister, Ruth.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.833
She was in the resistance.

09:59.867 --> 10:01.635
Oh, wow.
Good for her.

10:01.669 --> 10:03.904
- Good for her.
- Not for long, though.

10:03.937 --> 10:07.975
- No?
- The Nazis found them
about a week after she joined.

10:08.008 --> 10:11.311
- I see.
- Shot her in the back
of the head.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.781
- Ruth.
- Point-blank.

10:13.814 --> 10:16.316
Yeah, sure.
Ooh.

10:16.349 --> 10:18.151
Wow.

10:20.754 --> 10:24.892
My younger sister Tamar,
she survived Treblinka.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.327
She did?

10:28.762 --> 10:33.066
Of course, the liberators
gave them all food

10:33.100 --> 10:35.068
and she ate too quickly.

10:35.102 --> 10:38.071
- Uh-oh.
- Died two days later.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.707
Mm.

10:40.908 --> 10:45.012
- Diarrhea.
- Oh, that'll do her.

10:45.045 --> 10:48.015
Terrible way to go.

10:48.048 --> 10:50.450
- I knew others.
- Mm.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.886
Maya:
We all know the statistics:

10:52.920 --> 10:57.357
38 billion water bottles
wasted each year.

10:57.390 --> 11:00.327
17 million barrels
of oil annually

11:00.360 --> 11:03.096
to make those wasted
plastic water bottles--

11:03.130 --> 11:04.364
yada, yada, yada.

11:04.397 --> 11:06.066
But what if we're
not the enemy?

11:06.099 --> 11:07.701
What if we're the savior?

11:09.202 --> 11:12.706
Mississippi River.
Polluted.

11:12.740 --> 11:16.910
Ohio River.
Polluted.

11:16.944 --> 11:18.846
According to the EPA,
more than half

11:18.879 --> 11:20.814
of the rivers and waterways
in the United States

11:20.848 --> 11:22.783
can no longer
support life.

11:22.816 --> 11:25.352
13,000 miles
of river ways

11:25.385 --> 11:28.488
contain fish
with elevated levels
of mercury.

11:28.521 --> 11:32.059
This is not just
ecological apocalypse.

11:32.092 --> 11:36.129
This is a wonderful opportunity
for Nestle Waters.

11:36.163 --> 11:39.266
The anti-tap water strategy
worked for a while,

11:39.299 --> 11:41.468
but we need
to expand that.

11:41.501 --> 11:44.337
Nowadays, you can't
trust any water.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.273
Except ours.

11:46.306 --> 11:50.210
We're not polluters,
we're environmentalists.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.813
Let's make pollution
work for us.

11:52.846 --> 11:55.849
We are not the problem.
We are the solution.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.284
- Jonathan: I love it.
- Debbie: That's great.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.753
I love it.
Isn't--

11:59.787 --> 12:02.389
isn't Thom supposed
to be here? Thom?

12:06.126 --> 12:08.996
- ( music blaring
on headphones )
- ( quiet chatter )

12:17.137 --> 12:19.239
Your tax dollars
at work, folks!

12:19.272 --> 12:22.776
Your fucking
tax dollars at work.

12:22.810 --> 12:25.012
You think
they give a damn
if I'm late?

12:25.045 --> 12:26.980
They don't give a damn.

12:27.014 --> 12:28.916
I'm an attorney.

12:28.949 --> 12:31.451
I have motions to file,
cases to try.

12:31.484 --> 12:34.121
They are interfering with
a basic constitutional right.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.790
- We're all late for work.
- What's that supposed to mean?

12:36.824 --> 12:38.158
It's supposed
to mean shut up.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.459
That's what
it's supposed to mean.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.528
- Unbelievable.
- Liz, hey, it's me.

12:41.561 --> 12:42.930
We're stopped.
Dead stopped.

12:42.963 --> 12:45.332
Listen, I need you
to move my 9:00 to 10:00,

12:45.365 --> 12:47.167
my 10:00 to 11:00,
my 11:00 to 12:00,

12:47.200 --> 12:49.069
cancel my lunch with Bob
and see if he can do drinks
on Tuesday.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.171
I'll call in for my 4:00
on my way to my 3:00,

12:51.204 --> 12:53.273
but don't schedule anything
after 5:00 in case
my 4:00 runs long.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.876
- Hello?
- Jonathan: Thom?

12:55.909 --> 12:57.277
Hey, guys.
Uh, bad news.

12:57.310 --> 12:58.879
The train
is at a dead stop.

12:58.912 --> 13:01.181
Better late
than never, Thom!

13:01.214 --> 13:02.950
Thank you, Gottfrid.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.818
As Gustaff says,

13:04.852 --> 13:07.955
"No worms for you,
Mr. Early Bird."

13:07.988 --> 13:09.322
( all chuckle )

13:09.356 --> 13:10.557
Stay with us, Thom.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.025
Yeah, I'm gonna stay
on the line.

13:12.059 --> 13:14.061
Hopefully the train
will start moving soon.

13:14.094 --> 13:17.497
Maya:
So instead of being
the evil plastic bottle makers,

13:17.530 --> 13:20.333
Nestle becomes the voice
of environmentalism.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.169
"We just want you
to have clean water.

13:22.202 --> 13:25.372
But there isn't any.
So we go out, we find it,

13:25.405 --> 13:27.975
- and we bring it
to your supermarket."
- Jonathan: Yeah, I love it.

13:28.008 --> 13:30.978
- Debbie: Great opportunities
for social here, right?
- Jonathan: Yeah.

13:36.083 --> 13:38.986
- Would you like
the front page?
- No, thank you.

13:39.019 --> 13:40.854
- Read it?
- No.

13:40.888 --> 13:43.023
- Get it on your iPad?
- No.

13:44.257 --> 13:45.859
Then how come
you don't want it?

13:45.893 --> 13:47.127
Because I don't.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.062
- Why not?
- "Why not"?

13:49.096 --> 13:51.264
Aren't you interested
in the world around you?

13:51.298 --> 13:54.267
- Uh, no, I'm not.
- How can you say that?

13:54.301 --> 13:56.403
Uh, very happily.
( snaps fingers )

13:56.436 --> 13:58.138
- Hey.
- What?

13:58.171 --> 14:00.273
Can you turn that down, please?
It's very "boom, boom."

14:00.307 --> 14:02.842
It's affecting
other people.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.947
You can't just bury
your head in the sand.

14:06.980 --> 14:10.117
- Yes, you can.
- You need to stay informed.

14:10.150 --> 14:12.619
Okay, so what
have you learned today
in that newspaper

14:12.652 --> 14:14.254
that you didn't know
a year ago?

14:14.287 --> 14:16.289
Or 10 years ago?
That the Middle East
is fucked?

14:16.323 --> 14:19.960
That politicians lie,
that people kill?
That's not news.

14:19.993 --> 14:21.561
There's not enough misery
in your own life,

14:21.594 --> 14:23.630
and it's hard enough
trying to get through
the day

14:23.663 --> 14:25.966
without learning about
all the people who didn't
get through yesterday.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.968
That is
the most selfish thing
I've ever heard.

14:28.001 --> 14:30.503
( sighs )
Okay, why do you
read the newspapers?

14:30.537 --> 14:32.973
Hmm?
What, are you going
to cure Ebola?

14:33.006 --> 14:37.310
Are you going to solve
the Ukraine or Bahrain
or acid rain?

14:37.344 --> 14:39.246
You read the newspaper
'cause you think it gives
you an edge.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.548
Helps you get ahead.
Helps you stay connected.

14:41.581 --> 14:44.184
You know?
That's selfish
and deluded.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.053
You only care
about yourself.

14:46.086 --> 14:49.456
The best thing
people can do for others
is to examine themselves.

14:49.489 --> 14:52.325
But of course
it's a lot easier
to look in the pages

14:52.359 --> 14:55.262
of "The New York Times"
than it is to look
in the mirror.

14:55.295 --> 14:57.530
- For your information, I hap--
- Man on PA: Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.700
- We apologize
for the extended delay.
- Bullshit!

15:00.733 --> 15:03.036
As the train was entering
the station this morning,

15:03.070 --> 15:06.273
it struck a commuter
who had fallen on the tracks.

15:06.306 --> 15:09.409
Despite making every effort
to stop the train in time,

15:09.442 --> 15:12.012
this collision resulted
in a fatality.

15:12.045 --> 15:15.548
This train
is now a crime scene
and may not be moved.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.217
We apologize
for this inconvenience

15:17.250 --> 15:21.488
and will be sending
another train shortly
on the opposite track.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.023
That train
will continue on

15:23.056 --> 15:25.025
to Manhattan's
Grand Central Station.

15:25.058 --> 15:27.494
We apologize again
for the delay.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.968
Walter:
Well, she's a very old dog,

15:35.002 --> 15:39.372
but her hearing started to go
a couple of years back.

15:39.406 --> 15:41.641
Oh, that'll happen.

15:41.674 --> 15:44.044
- It's not so bad...
- Mm-hmm.

15:44.077 --> 15:46.179
...except that
she has diabetes.

15:46.213 --> 15:47.614
Mm.

15:47.647 --> 15:50.650
If she doesn't get
her shots on time,
don't ask.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.652
You know what, Walter?
I am so sorry.

15:52.685 --> 15:56.056
I've got to pick up
my son in, like, an hour
from school, so I've--

15:56.089 --> 15:58.591
She'd never make it
through the night.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.393
No, I wouldn't think so.

16:00.427 --> 16:03.530
Her sister died
last year.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.398
I figured.

16:05.432 --> 16:08.168
- Coyotes got her.
- Yep.

16:10.270 --> 16:12.472
( screams )

16:12.505 --> 16:15.442
( thumping )

16:17.710 --> 16:19.212
Fuck!

16:19.246 --> 16:21.548
( exhales sharply )

16:21.581 --> 16:23.650
( groans )

16:24.551 --> 16:26.119
Okay.

16:27.387 --> 16:29.556
Woman:
Almighty Father,
eternal God,

16:29.589 --> 16:32.159
hear our prayers
for Your son/daughter

16:32.192 --> 16:34.427
whom You have called
from this life to Yourself.

16:34.461 --> 16:38.365
Grant him/her light,
happiness, and peace.

16:38.398 --> 16:42.302
Let him/her pass in safety
through the gates of death.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.571
Guard him/her from harm.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.439
And on that great day
of resurrection,

16:46.473 --> 16:50.110
raise him/her up
with all Your saints.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.444
Amen.

16:51.478 --> 16:52.645
Amen.

16:52.679 --> 16:56.183
So horrible.

16:56.216 --> 16:57.717
It's unbelievable.

16:57.750 --> 17:00.687
It could've been anyone,
you know?

17:02.155 --> 17:05.192
I didn't hug my son
this morning.

17:05.225 --> 17:09.329
Just, you know,
"Sorry, buddy, gotta go.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.698
Time to make
the doughnuts."

17:13.766 --> 17:17.204
You know what?
I think you were right.

17:17.237 --> 17:20.673
About this newspaper,
about the world.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.810
I mean, I waste
so much time

17:23.843 --> 17:27.147
thinking about everything
but what really matters.

17:27.180 --> 17:31.151
I mean, newspapers,
trade papers, magazines,

17:31.184 --> 17:34.087
blogs, Twitter feeds,
"People" fucking magazine,

17:34.121 --> 17:36.289
all day, every day,
and for what?

17:36.323 --> 17:41.561
I mean, should it take death
to make you think about life?

17:41.594 --> 17:43.763
It really makes
you think, you know?

17:43.796 --> 17:46.699
About how you're
spending your life.

17:46.733 --> 17:49.336
That's why I carry Jesus
in my heart.

17:49.369 --> 17:53.506
Because all of life
is just a chance to get
closer to Jesus.

17:53.540 --> 17:58.245
And when you
get closer to Jesus,
you get closer to peace.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.480
It's been so long
since I've been to church.

18:00.513 --> 18:02.782
I should go,

18:02.815 --> 18:04.784
get some perspective,
you know?

18:04.817 --> 18:09.356
I picture myself
doing all this stupid work.

18:09.389 --> 18:12.325
Happy as a pig in shit.

18:12.359 --> 18:14.461
It doesn't matter
how happy you are.

18:14.494 --> 18:15.895
- It's still shit.
- Mm-hmm.

18:15.928 --> 18:19.399
And if you're
happy in shit...

18:19.432 --> 18:20.533
You're probably a pig.

18:20.567 --> 18:22.602
Mm-hmm.
( chuckles )

18:22.635 --> 18:26.473
( crying )

18:26.506 --> 18:29.242
( train horn blares )

18:32.379 --> 18:35.482
I hear she was reading
her iPad when she fell in.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.650
So sad.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.753
I hear the new one's
gonna have a better screen.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.355
The old one already had
retina display.

18:42.389 --> 18:44.491
No, I don't mean the display,
I mean the screen.

18:44.524 --> 18:46.259
- What about the screen?
- Split.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.428
- Split?
- Split. You can have
two windows open.

18:48.461 --> 18:49.696
- No way!
- Way.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.231
I gotta get
to the Apple Store.

18:51.264 --> 18:53.166
Me, too.
Where the fuck
is this train?

18:53.200 --> 18:54.834
It's typical.
They screwed up
my morning,

18:54.867 --> 18:56.436
they might as well
screw up my afternoon.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.838
How hard could it be
for them to find one train?

18:58.871 --> 19:00.707
Hey, Liz.
Still waiting.
Listen.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.842
Send me the email
with the Word doc
you converted from that PDF.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.844
I'll enclose the JPEGs,
upload it to Dropbox,

19:04.877 --> 19:06.813
and you can transfer it all
to the final PowerPoint.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.781
Make sure you cc
Gary and David,
bcc Amy...

19:08.815 --> 19:11.284
Jonathan on phone:
We can't just go in
with a bunch of TV.

19:11.318 --> 19:12.819
- Wieden & Bulgari
are gonna come in...
- ( train horn blaring )

19:12.852 --> 19:13.986
...with a mountain
of digital shit.

19:14.020 --> 19:15.855
Debbie:
We should think about,
at some point,

19:15.888 --> 19:17.590
of advocacy work
we can do.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.859
You know,
"fight pollution,"
or whatever,

19:19.892 --> 19:22.595
while reminding everyone
not to drink other water.

19:22.629 --> 19:23.796
Maya:
Definitely.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.366
Classic
zero-to-hero strategy.

19:27.634 --> 19:29.436
Our target lives online.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.738
I take some money
out of traditional media,

19:31.771 --> 19:34.341
really make this
a Facebook-led campaign.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.743
Jonathan:
I say take the money,
give half to Greenpeace,

19:36.776 --> 19:39.946
spend the other half
publicizing the hell
out of our donation.

19:39.979 --> 19:41.681
Debbie:
We did charity
last year, Jonathan.

19:41.714 --> 19:42.949
It barely moved
the needle.

19:42.982 --> 19:45.452
I think we can spend
our money better elsewhere.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.487
Track 18!
Track 18!

19:47.520 --> 19:49.889
Maya:
What about #giveadamn?

19:49.922 --> 19:53.560
You didn't send a PDF,
Liz, you sent a zip.

19:53.593 --> 19:54.994
Just send me a JPEG,
for Christ's sake.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.230
Gottfrid:
I like this idea
of #giveadamn.

19:57.264 --> 19:58.898
You know, really involve
the consumer...

19:58.931 --> 20:01.768
Come on, no, no, no.
I've had a hell of a day!

20:01.801 --> 20:03.436
Maya:
We need a handle for this,

20:03.470 --> 20:05.438
something that
encapsulates the idea

20:05.472 --> 20:07.907
that natural water
is dangerous.

20:07.940 --> 20:10.343
Oh, well, how about
just that?

20:10.377 --> 20:11.844
How about, um...

20:11.878 --> 20:15.248
you know,
"Natural Water Isn't."

20:15.282 --> 20:19.486
When it is,
you can drink it,
but it's not right now.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.020
Maya:
I like that.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.755
You could just have,
"Because Natural Water Isn't,"

20:22.789 --> 20:23.923
then a list
of chemicals in the ocean

20:23.956 --> 20:25.658
versus a Poland Spring
bottle.

20:25.692 --> 20:27.594
Jonathan: Compelling.
That's a good one, Thom.

20:27.627 --> 20:29.929
- You almost here?
- Um...

20:31.298 --> 20:33.500
no.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.768
We're still on the train.

20:35.802 --> 20:38.338
Just sitting here.

20:38.371 --> 20:40.640
We hit something
on the track.

20:40.673 --> 20:43.543
Gottfrid:
I hope they at least
killed it, yes, Thom?

20:43.576 --> 20:47.514
Jonathan:
Okay, uh, let's talk about
the presentation...

20:47.547 --> 20:50.550
Man on PA:
This is the last call
for 156,

20:50.583 --> 20:53.453
Southeast Scarborough
through South Fordham.

21:17.610 --> 21:20.380
Thom:
Here's what else happens
when you hit your 40s.

21:20.413 --> 21:23.383
You start thinking about
"The Outlaw Josey Wales."

21:23.416 --> 21:24.551
At least I did.

21:26.686 --> 21:28.888
Clint Eastwood, 1976.

21:30.423 --> 21:32.859
Josey's in this bar
when a guy walks in.

21:32.892 --> 21:35.828
Bad guy, black hat,
cigar in his mouth.

21:37.764 --> 21:41.334
- Hey!
- Thom: "I'm looking for
Josey Wales," he calls out.

21:41.368 --> 21:43.069
Josey's standing
in the shadows,

21:43.102 --> 21:46.739
hand on his pistol, says,
"Are you a bounty hunter?"

21:46.773 --> 21:48.841
The guy turns to him
and says,

21:48.875 --> 21:52.011
"A man's gotta do something
for a living these days."

21:52.044 --> 21:54.747
Josey sneers,
looks at him, and says,

21:54.781 --> 21:57.350
"Dyin' ain't
much of a living, boy."

21:57.384 --> 22:00.086
"Dying ain't much
of a living, boy."

22:00.119 --> 22:02.755
And then he shoots him
through the heart.

22:02.789 --> 22:05.458
Jonathan on phone:
Great, this was a very
productive meeting.

22:05.492 --> 22:08.828
I'm happy.
Thom, are you happy?

22:08.861 --> 22:10.096
Gottfrid:
Did we lose him?

22:10.129 --> 22:11.598
Maya:
I think we lost him.

22:11.631 --> 22:13.099
Gottfrid:
Jonathan, I really think Thom

22:13.132 --> 22:14.967
needs to get
his priorities straight.

22:15.001 --> 22:18.438
Jonathan: Thom?
Thom, you there?

22:18.471 --> 22:20.006
Thom?

22:21.508 --> 22:25.011

22:25.044 --> 22:27.580

23:00.713 --> 23:03.550

23:03.583 --> 23:06.018

23:06.052 --> 23:08.888
