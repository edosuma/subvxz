WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:07.967
Last season on Bosch...

00:08.008 --> 00:10.720
BOSCH:
Any airport out there
reading this,

00:10.761 --> 00:13.639
this is
Detective Harry Bosch, LAPD.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.391
-Time to jump, cop.
-BOSCH: In-air incident.

00:15.391 --> 00:17.560
One passenger dead.

00:17.601 --> 00:19.979
-(screams)
-One missing.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.982
I am inbound
to Whiteman Airport. Out.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.567
MADDIE:
Did you kill someone?

00:24.650 --> 00:27.069
BOSCH:
I did. They were trying
to kill me.

00:27.111 --> 00:28.279
How many people have you killed?

00:28.320 --> 00:30.156
Why the hell would you ask
a question like that?

00:30.197 --> 00:32.575
EDGAR:
His name is Gary Wise.

00:32.616 --> 00:34.243
He was my C.I.

00:36.871 --> 00:38.873
-This is not your fault, J.
-It feels like it.

00:38.914 --> 00:40.708
BOSCH:
What happened?

00:40.708 --> 00:43.419
EDGAR:
I think someone saw him
talking to Marcos and Arias.

00:43.461 --> 00:45.045
Thing is...

00:45.087 --> 00:46.589
I put 'em together.

00:46.630 --> 00:48.257
MADDIE:
Did you work
the Skyler murder case?

00:48.299 --> 00:50.217
Somebody in my office said
they're investigating it.

00:50.259 --> 00:52.261
BOSCH:
No basis for it. It's bullshit.

00:52.303 --> 00:54.430
I've never planted evidence.
Never.

00:54.472 --> 00:55.973
I believe you.

00:56.015 --> 00:58.017
-Clear, right? Wait!
-(siren blaring)

00:58.058 --> 00:59.226
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:00.311 --> 01:02.271
COOPER:
Crate and Barrel.

01:02.313 --> 01:04.982
This is the perfect opportunity
to clear out the dead wood.

01:05.024 --> 01:08.027
-We can't force 'em to retire.
-No, but we can move them.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.487
Where?

01:09.528 --> 01:12.406
CAPs. Fucking CAPs.
Jumped on cases.

01:12.448 --> 01:14.825
Bunch of "he said, she said."

01:14.867 --> 01:16.827
No. Fuck that!

01:17.578 --> 01:19.121
I'll eat my gun first!

01:19.163 --> 01:20.372
Charlie Hovan.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.166
-DEA.
-You under?

01:22.208 --> 01:23.959
14 months.

01:24.001 --> 01:26.086
-IRVING: What's all the blue?
-Districts where you're leading

01:26.128 --> 01:28.088
in our preliminary polling.

01:28.130 --> 01:30.424
You are aware police chiefs
have not had much success

01:30.466 --> 01:32.092
as mayoral candidates.

01:32.134 --> 01:34.678
-Somebody's juking the stats.
-I'll look into it.

01:34.720 --> 01:37.306
-You really think
it's gonna come to that?
-What?

01:37.348 --> 01:39.391
MANKIEWICZ:
Blowing the whistle.

01:43.020 --> 01:45.648
I got a text this morning from
someone in the D.A.'s office.

01:45.689 --> 01:47.608
BOSCH:
Who's your source?

01:47.650 --> 01:49.276
Now, you know
I can't tell you that.

01:49.318 --> 01:51.070
The matter before the court
is withdrawn.

01:51.111 --> 01:55.282
Detective Bosch, I wish you
the best of luck, sir.

01:55.324 --> 01:57.827
And you're welcome
in my courtroom anytime.

01:57.868 --> 01:58.953
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:58.994 --> 02:00.788
CHANDLER:
Maybe Maddie could come intern

02:00.830 --> 02:02.957
with me, see how
the other half lives.

02:02.998 --> 02:04.416
I know what you did.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.794
BOSCH: What's going on?
Boyfriend trouble?

02:06.836 --> 02:08.629
-'Cause I noticed
a little tension.
-MADDIE: It's not him.

02:08.671 --> 02:10.214
It's you.

02:10.256 --> 02:12.341
Me?

02:12.383 --> 02:14.176
-What'd I do?
-Nothing.

02:14.218 --> 02:16.428
-You're just you.
-ESPINOSA: Something curious

02:16.470 --> 02:18.097
came up when we searched
Gary Wise's apartment.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.641
We found
a Smith & Wesson nine mil,

02:20.683 --> 02:22.017
confiscated in a drug bust.

02:22.059 --> 02:24.728
-How'd it get back
on the streets?
-Mm. Good question.

02:24.770 --> 02:26.522
EDGAR:
It's got to be an inside job.

02:26.564 --> 02:29.316
What did Gary have to do
with these people?

02:29.358 --> 02:30.651
Why'd they kill my son?

02:30.693 --> 02:31.986
EDGAR:
Your source-- what's his name?

02:32.027 --> 02:33.320
ARIAS:
Jacques Avril.

02:33.362 --> 02:35.197
Runs a chain of 7-Elevens
in the South Bay.

02:35.239 --> 02:37.408
-Does it ring a bell or...?
-Ki sa?

02:39.159 --> 02:41.579
-Are you who I think you are?
-And who is that?

02:41.620 --> 02:45.583
Jacques Avril,
the Butcher of Pétionville,

02:45.624 --> 02:47.501
who murdered
my mother's brother?

02:47.543 --> 02:49.461
What was his name?

02:49.503 --> 02:51.171
Antoine Hector.

02:52.965 --> 02:55.759
Wasn't me.

02:55.801 --> 02:58.178
That was my father.

02:58.220 --> 03:01.223
EDGAR:
Stolen weapons had to be
an inside job.

03:01.265 --> 03:04.143
Whoever did it,
they're worried about exposure.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.812
-Dirty cops.
-(sighs) Looks like.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.439
Who?

03:08.480 --> 03:09.940
IRVING:
I cut my teeth

03:09.982 --> 03:13.027
trolling the streets
of this great city.

03:13.068 --> 03:14.987
A cop is who I am,
who I always will be.

03:15.029 --> 03:17.698
But I stand before you today

03:17.740 --> 03:19.116
to announce
that I am exploring a run

03:19.158 --> 03:21.118
for mayor of Los Angeles.

03:21.160 --> 03:23.245
-CLAYTON: You think
you can save me.
-You all right?

03:23.287 --> 03:26.040
(exhales)
Don't talk to me. Fuck off.

03:26.081 --> 03:28.083
You think you're the only one
that's ever tried.

03:28.125 --> 03:29.627
She O.D.'d! Call 911!

03:29.668 --> 03:31.503
BOSCH:
I clocked the
"rest in peace" tattoo.

03:31.545 --> 03:32.838
Who's Daisy?

03:32.880 --> 03:34.506
It's her daughter.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.133
She was murdered.

03:36.175 --> 03:38.594
About ten years ago.
She was 14.

03:38.636 --> 03:40.054
CLAYTON:
I'd get fucked up.

03:40.095 --> 03:42.097
She'd get bored, run off.

03:42.139 --> 03:43.599
Then one day,

03:43.641 --> 03:46.644
she went off and, uh,
didn't come back.

03:48.187 --> 03:49.939
Police found her body.

03:50.981 --> 03:52.983

welfare check on the wife?

11:37.614 --> 11:38.990
Not yet.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.829
What's that, Potts, I.D. tag?

11:46.873 --> 11:49.292
St. Agatha's. Flip it over.

11:51.128 --> 11:52.671

11:52.712 --> 11:54.798
Okay, thanks, Potts.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.302
Go to St. Ag's.

11:59.344 --> 12:01.430
If Kent had an office there,
lock it down.

12:01.471 --> 12:02.973

for everything:

phone, e-mail, swipe card,

12:04.975 --> 12:06.435
-the whole nine.

Why is Marcos staring at us?

12:47.851 --> 12:49.728
LOCHNER:
He's a paranoid motherfucker.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.730
EDGAR:
He feels us.

12:51.771 --> 12:55.442
The hairs on the back
of his chest are standing up.

12:55.484 --> 12:57.569
You're paranoid.

12:58.653 --> 13:00.530
(phone vibrates)

13:01.948 --> 13:03.950
(siren wailing in distance)

13:08.622 --> 13:10.040
(text message chirps)

13:13.710 --> 13:15.003
Clear?

13:15.045 --> 13:16.379
Go now.

13:26.097 --> 13:27.891
-Ron. (chuckles)
-MAN: Hey.

13:27.933 --> 13:30.310
-Good to see you.
-I think you know these guys.

13:30.352 --> 13:32.270
Indeed I do.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.481
LAPD's finest.
Sorely missed.

13:34.523 --> 13:35.899
Malarkey.

13:35.941 --> 13:38.068
-Respectfully.
-(both laugh)

13:38.109 --> 13:39.611
-Detective Rodgers.
-Chief.

13:39.653 --> 13:42.656
-Keeping busy?
-Writing my memoirs.

13:42.697 --> 13:44.074
(laughs)

13:44.115 --> 13:45.784
-Detective Jackson.
-Chief.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.828
-I trust I have your vote.
-Well, if I still lived in L.A.

13:48.870 --> 13:50.705
I forgot.

13:50.747 --> 13:52.999
So how's life
in, uh, Walnut Creek?

13:53.041 --> 13:54.459
Well, nothing so swank.

13:54.501 --> 13:55.919
-Petaluma.
-(chuckles softly)

13:55.961 --> 13:57.462
KOWSKI:
Your checks are
still good in L.A.

13:57.504 --> 13:58.880
Grassroots fundraising.

13:58.922 --> 14:00.924
No contributions
over a hundred bucks.

14:00.966 --> 14:03.134
And I was gonna spring
for a grand.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.636
(laughter)

14:04.678 --> 14:07.514
IrvingForMayor.com.
All one word.

14:07.556 --> 14:10.267
Well, I'll let you all get back
to your flapjacks.

14:10.308 --> 14:12.477
(laughing)

14:12.519 --> 14:14.813
Someone I really
want you to meet.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.731
Ray Thacker.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.567
Chief Irving.

14:18.608 --> 14:20.318
-Jen.
-Mr. Thacker.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.653
What a pleasure.

14:21.695 --> 14:23.572
Please, join me.

14:27.242 --> 14:29.077
I can't believe we've never met.

14:29.119 --> 14:31.162
Ray worked on
Mayor Ramos's campaigns.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.456
-Both of them.
-Set records.

14:33.498 --> 14:36.418
I'd like to do the same for you.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.297
I'm not sure
that's really necessary.

14:40.338 --> 14:42.424
We're doing fine with
our small donors approach.

14:42.465 --> 14:45.051
Chief, you've spent
your professional life

14:45.093 --> 14:48.054
in a system where rank and
promotion are achieved by merit.

14:48.096 --> 14:51.391
Well, mostly merit.
More or less.

14:51.433 --> 14:53.268
This is a new world for you.

14:53.310 --> 14:56.354
The best man doesn't always win.

14:56.396 --> 14:59.774
At the end of the day,
this is about money.

14:59.816 --> 15:02.736
Ray can raise the dollars
you need to become mayor.

15:05.655 --> 15:07.991
I'm feeling
a little bushwhacked here.

15:08.033 --> 15:10.201
THACKER:
Jack Killoran's

15:10.243 --> 15:12.454
-about to jump into the race.
-Killoran?

15:12.495 --> 15:14.289
The car dealer?

15:14.331 --> 15:16.374
He's white and self-funded,

15:16.416 --> 15:19.294
and he is gonna hurt you
in the Valley.

15:19.336 --> 15:21.296
Susanna Lopez
has East L.A. sewn up,

15:21.338 --> 15:23.381
and the two of you
split the south side.

15:23.423 --> 15:27.844
Whoever takes the liberal
Westside takes it all.

15:27.886 --> 15:30.263
And both have deeper pockets.

15:32.474 --> 15:34.059
And lighter complexions.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.479
That's the reality.

15:43.943 --> 15:44.944
(tires screech)

16:09.302 --> 16:11.304
LAPD. Anyone home?

16:13.973 --> 16:15.975
Mrs. Kent?

16:20.563 --> 16:22.565
Door. Open door, open door.

16:24.609 --> 16:26.778
♪ ♪

16:26.820 --> 16:29.030
LAPD. Anyone home?

16:35.120 --> 16:36.538
Clear.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.587
-OFFICER: Clear.
-Clear.

16:47.507 --> 16:48.925
OFFICER:
Clear.

16:50.552 --> 16:53.596
-(muffled whimpering)
-OFFICER: Clear.

16:53.638 --> 16:56.349
Mrs. Kent,
I'm Detective Harry Bosch, LAPD.

16:56.391 --> 16:57.809
You're safe.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.938
I got you.

17:01.980 --> 17:03.982
-I got you. I got you.
-(whimpering continues)

17:07.068 --> 17:09.070
Stay still. Stay still.

17:11.865 --> 17:13.366
(gasps) Where's my husband?

17:13.408 --> 17:15.493
-I got you. I got you.
-(crying)

17:15.535 --> 17:18.329
Where is he?

17:18.371 --> 17:19.748
-(groans)
-You all right?

17:19.789 --> 17:22.667
Easy, easy, easy.
Here. Sit down.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.210
I'm just dizzy. It's okay.

17:24.252 --> 17:26.463
Okay, okay. What do you need?

17:26.504 --> 17:28.715
I need...

17:28.757 --> 17:31.760
my robe, in the closet.

17:33.762 --> 17:35.805
(crying)

17:35.847 --> 17:37.265
(whispers):
Here.

17:42.061 --> 17:45.398
Please, tell me...

17:45.440 --> 17:47.484
is my husband okay?

17:49.569 --> 17:52.572
You need to hire him
before somebody else does.

17:56.159 --> 17:59.120
I'll think about it.

17:59.162 --> 18:01.164
Don't think too long.

18:10.173 --> 18:12.175
(quiet chatter)

18:18.014 --> 18:19.432
(quietly):
That's it.

18:29.943 --> 18:33.321
There was a car in the drive.

18:33.363 --> 18:35.031
I thought it was Stan.

18:35.073 --> 18:36.825
These two men
pushed their way in.

18:36.866 --> 18:39.452
Can you describe them?

18:39.494 --> 18:40.954
I couldn't see their faces.

18:40.995 --> 18:44.374
They were wearing
ski masks and gloves.

18:44.415 --> 18:48.044
I thought they were gonna
rape me, kill me.

18:49.754 --> 18:51.422
They...

18:51.464 --> 18:53.299
dragged me by my hair
into the bathroom.

18:53.341 --> 18:55.635
They put a knife to my neck,

18:55.677 --> 18:57.637
said that they were...
were gonna cut my throat

18:57.679 --> 18:59.430
if I didn't give them
what they wanted.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.099
Which was?

19:01.140 --> 19:03.935
Keys to my car
and password to my cell phone.

19:03.977 --> 19:05.812
I... blanked.

19:05.854 --> 19:08.398
I couldn't remember
the fucking passcode.

19:08.439 --> 19:10.024
One of them slapped me hard,

19:10.066 --> 19:13.820
and I gave them the code
and they tied me up.

19:13.862 --> 19:17.866
The way they talked--
black, white, Latino?

19:17.907 --> 19:19.868
-Could you tell?
-Yeah, one was definitely white.

19:19.909 --> 19:22.537
He had a, um,
tattoo on his wrist,

19:22.579 --> 19:25.206
mm, a number.

19:25.248 --> 19:26.791
308. (sighs)

19:30.920 --> 19:32.881
After they tied you up?

19:32.922 --> 19:35.300
They took a picture of me
with my cell phone

19:35.341 --> 19:37.594
and they sent it to Stan.

19:37.635 --> 19:39.178
And then they left.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.682
-Is this your phone?
-Where did you find it?

19:42.724 --> 19:43.892
In the garage.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.351
Can I have it back, please?

19:45.393 --> 19:48.521
It-It's evidence. We'll get it
back to you as soon as we can.

19:48.563 --> 19:50.148
(sighs):
Okay.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.483
Did they ever say
what they wanted?

19:52.525 --> 19:53.860
No.

19:53.902 --> 19:55.820
I assume money.

19:55.862 --> 19:58.656
What does your husband do?

19:58.698 --> 20:01.200
He's a medical physicist.

20:01.242 --> 20:02.869
He handles...

20:05.580 --> 20:08.374
...handled

20:08.416 --> 20:11.294
radioactive material
for cancer treatment.

20:11.336 --> 20:13.379
Cesium and iridium.

20:13.421 --> 20:16.466
This stuff, is it valuable?

20:16.507 --> 20:19.093
No. It's dangerous.

20:19.135 --> 20:21.012
It's extremely toxic.

20:21.054 --> 20:23.473
If it gets
in the wrong hands, it...

20:25.892 --> 20:28.019
You think that's
what they're after?

20:30.229 --> 20:32.231
I'm gonna show you something.

20:35.568 --> 20:40.239
Yeah, those are radiation rings,
used to read radiation exposure.

20:41.950 --> 20:45.203
Those are Stan's hands.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.580
Oh, my God.

20:48.623 --> 20:51.793
(siren wailing)

20:57.590 --> 20:58.967
VEGA:
Where'd he go?

20:59.008 --> 21:00.843
Nuclear Med Lab.

21:02.637 --> 21:04.681
-No CCTV?
-No.

21:04.722 --> 21:06.349
Let me fast-forward.

21:09.143 --> 21:10.853
What's that he's rolling?

21:10.895 --> 21:12.689
ROMO:
A pig.

21:12.730 --> 21:15.441
Lead container for transporting
radioactive materials.

21:17.402 --> 21:18.820
Show us the lab.

21:23.032 --> 21:25.827
-Hmm.
-What?

21:25.868 --> 21:28.287
Odd hour to be
accessing this material.

21:28.329 --> 21:30.331
And hardly anyone
uses cesium anymore.

21:30.373 --> 21:32.000
It's old-school.

21:39.173 --> 21:40.383
Gone.

21:42.051 --> 21:44.012
The whole inventory's gone.

21:44.053 --> 21:46.305
The log says he only took one.

21:49.267 --> 21:51.394
Note says he took 32.

21:53.855 --> 21:55.314
(cell phone beeps)

21:55.356 --> 21:57.358
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

21:59.777 --> 22:01.988
What time he empty the safe?

22:02.030 --> 22:03.990
Uh, 10:38 last night.

22:04.032 --> 22:06.784
-Feds have landed.
-FBI?

22:09.078 --> 22:11.372
Should be coming
your way any minute.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.125
(door opens)

22:14.167 --> 22:16.127
Voilà. Just walked in.

22:16.169 --> 22:17.795
Check back later.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.841
Gentlemen. Jack Brenner.

22:21.883 --> 22:23.926
FBI, Special Agent in Charge.

22:23.968 --> 22:25.803
Agents Maxwell, Reece.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.472
You must be Bosch and Edgar.

22:27.513 --> 22:29.432
Your lieutenant told us
where to find you.

22:29.474 --> 22:30.975
We just came from
the crime scene.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.393
That was fast.

22:32.435 --> 22:35.855
-Stanley Kent's on a watch list.
-Tell us what you know so far.

22:35.897 --> 22:37.482
According to Mrs. Kent,

22:37.523 --> 22:40.318
two men invaded their house last
night, held her at knifepoint.

22:40.359 --> 22:43.237
Dr. Kent got a demand text
from his wife's phone,

22:43.279 --> 22:45.448
picture of her bound and gagged.

22:45.490 --> 22:46.824
What was the demand?

22:46.866 --> 22:49.994
"Get us cesium or else,"
which he did.

22:50.036 --> 22:53.664
32 tubes from the Nuclear
Medicine Lab at St. Ag's.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.625
-Any sign of the cesium?
-No.

22:55.666 --> 22:58.336
But there are marks
in the trunk of Kent's car

22:58.377 --> 23:00.379
consistent with
a heavy container.

23:00.421 --> 23:02.340
We sent a HRT team
to the crime scene,

23:02.381 --> 23:05.051
-see if they can
pick up the scent.
-You can track it?

23:05.093 --> 23:08.137
We can't detect it as long as
the cesium's in the pig, but...

23:08.179 --> 23:10.681
-if they were to take it out
and use it...
-Use it how?

23:10.723 --> 23:11.974
As a weapon.

23:12.016 --> 23:14.060
Released in
the right environment,

23:14.102 --> 23:16.479
catastrophic, mass casualties.

23:16.521 --> 23:19.941
BRENNER:
LAX, City Hall, Dodger Stadium--

23:19.982 --> 23:22.527
unusable for 300 years.

23:22.568 --> 23:23.736
Jesus.

23:23.778 --> 23:25.446
What did Mrs. Kent say
about her assailants?

23:25.488 --> 23:29.075
Not much. No faces.
Masks and gloves.

23:29.117 --> 23:31.202
White, by the way they talk.

23:31.244 --> 23:33.037
I need to see that demand text.

23:33.079 --> 23:35.873
Interview Mrs. Kent
as soon as she's up for it,

23:35.915 --> 23:37.875
send a full forensics team
to the crime scene,

23:37.917 --> 23:39.877
-and get me an update
from St. Agatha's.
-Done.

23:39.919 --> 23:42.880
And set a powwow for LAPD Major
Crimes and Hollywood Homicide.

23:45.967 --> 23:47.552
This you bigfooting my case

23:47.593 --> 23:49.178
in the name
of national security?

23:49.220 --> 23:51.931
I hope to continue
our cooperation, Detective.

23:51.973 --> 23:54.183
-I work my murder.
-And we want you to.

23:54.225 --> 23:56.018
Just so we're clear,
you share what you find.

23:56.060 --> 23:58.604
Just so we're clear,
goes both ways.

23:58.646 --> 24:00.690
-We'll keep you in the loop.
-Okay.

24:02.400 --> 24:04.986
I hear you're
a capable detective.

24:06.028 --> 24:07.488
I do my job.

24:07.530 --> 24:09.448
You have a checkered history
with the FBI.

24:09.490 --> 24:12.410
Yeah, well...
you know the circumstances.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.495
We cut you some slack.

24:14.537 --> 24:16.956
I'd do it again in a heartbeat.

24:21.961 --> 24:24.130
Think they know
about the tattoo?

24:24.172 --> 24:27.091
They will after they talk
to Mrs. Kent.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.886
308. That could be anything.

24:29.927 --> 24:32.096
Area code. Time of day.

24:32.138 --> 24:33.681
Batting average.

24:33.723 --> 24:35.141
I.Q.

24:36.559 --> 24:37.852
BILLETS:
"Do what we say.

24:37.894 --> 24:39.770
All the cesium. No cops."

24:39.812 --> 24:41.772
What will they do with it?

24:41.814 --> 24:43.482
BOSCH:
Hold the city hostage.

24:43.524 --> 24:45.276
Make 32 IEDs.

24:45.318 --> 24:46.819
Contaminate the water supply.

24:46.861 --> 24:49.447
Build a dirty bomb.
Sky's the limit.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.115
Well, I set up a meeting
with MCD

24:51.157 --> 24:52.992
and the special agent in charge.

24:53.034 --> 24:55.453
Yeah, Brenner.
Promised to keep us in the loop.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.872
We all know what that's worth.

24:57.914 --> 24:59.332
They're gonna shroom us.

24:59.373 --> 25:00.791
Keep us in the dark

25:00.833 --> 25:02.001
and feed us shit.

25:02.043 --> 25:03.336
Work your murder.

25:03.377 --> 25:05.379
I intend to.

25:09.383 --> 25:12.345
(sighs)
What a fucking shitstorm.

25:17.391 --> 25:20.269
CHANDLER:
I have a pro bono case
I want you to work on.

25:20.311 --> 25:22.688
It's an erroneous
conviction claim.

25:22.730 --> 25:25.983
We're filing an application with
the Victims Compensation Fund.

25:26.025 --> 25:27.401
Our client's the victim?

25:27.443 --> 25:29.487
Wrongfully convicted of murder.

25:29.528 --> 25:30.988
Ten years in prison.

25:31.030 --> 25:33.491
Thanks to DNA, now a free man.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.993
And entitled to compensation
for time served.

25:36.035 --> 25:37.495
What do you want me to do?

25:37.536 --> 25:40.081
Read and summarize
the trial testimony.

25:40.122 --> 25:41.290
I can do that.

25:41.332 --> 25:42.792
It's a lot of material.

25:42.833 --> 25:45.253
CHANDLER:
Be diligent.

25:45.294 --> 25:46.837
Take your time.

25:48.839 --> 25:50.258
Understood.

25:53.177 --> 25:55.221
How much is he entitled to?

25:55.263 --> 25:58.516
That's set by state statute.

25:58.557 --> 26:02.061
$140 for every day of
wrongful incarceration.

26:03.104 --> 26:04.063
Ten years.

26:04.105 --> 26:07.275
3,650 times 140...

26:07.316 --> 26:10.403
It's a little over
half a million dollars.

26:10.444 --> 26:12.446
That doesn't seem like much.

26:12.488 --> 26:14.448
It's not.

26:14.490 --> 26:15.825
It's a start.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.580
Bosch reports to me directly.

26:21.622 --> 26:24.000
I will make sure that
he keeps you informed, Chief.

26:24.041 --> 26:26.919
No voice mail, no messages.
Me, personally.

26:26.961 --> 26:28.838
On an up-to-the-minute basis,
Lieutenant.

26:28.879 --> 26:30.006
Are we clear?

26:30.047 --> 26:31.882
Yes, sir.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.887
-Double-shot?
-Triple.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.973
You're a lifesaver.

26:39.015 --> 26:41.225
Eight hours to go
and I'm already fading.

26:42.893 --> 26:45.938
This nine-year-old kid
came in with a skull fracture.

26:45.980 --> 26:47.231
He gonna make it?

26:47.273 --> 26:49.191
Absolutely.

26:49.233 --> 26:51.569
I don't know
how you do what you do.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.612
Uh, how's your work?

26:54.905 --> 26:56.407
Guess who got a new assignment.

26:56.449 --> 26:58.617
-Something interesting, I hope.
-No.

26:58.659 --> 27:00.703
Same old, same old.
Murder, prison.

27:00.745 --> 27:04.373
Wrongful conviction,
DNA exoneration, major lawsuit.

27:04.415 --> 27:05.416
-Boring.
-Yeah.

27:05.458 --> 27:06.667
(both chuckle)

27:07.710 --> 27:09.795
Can you sneak away for a bite?

27:09.837 --> 27:11.839
Things are really crazy.

27:11.881 --> 27:13.424
I mean, everyone's on call.

27:13.466 --> 27:15.384
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

27:15.426 --> 27:18.304
Ebola? Measles? Typhoid fever?

27:18.346 --> 27:20.222
Who knows?

27:20.264 --> 27:22.975
My friend at Cedars texted me;
it's the same deal.

27:28.856 --> 27:30.816
Marcos and Arias
booked the guns.

27:30.858 --> 27:32.693
Cash, too. Every buck.

27:32.735 --> 27:34.028
Shit.

27:34.070 --> 27:35.696
Maybe you're right.

27:35.738 --> 27:37.615
Maybe they are onto us.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.533
We're this close.

27:40.576 --> 27:41.619
Have a drink.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.871
I got a case.

27:55.883 --> 27:57.885
(indistinct
air traffic radio chatter)

28:08.104 --> 28:10.606
(footsteps approaching)

28:10.648 --> 28:12.608
Hey. How was dinner?

28:12.650 --> 28:14.777
Dinner was a triple-shot latte.

28:14.819 --> 28:15.778
He couldn't get away.

28:15.820 --> 28:17.655
Nine-year-old kid
with a fractured skull.

28:17.696 --> 28:18.697
Accident?

28:19.740 --> 28:22.576
-Probably not.
-Tough job he's got.

28:22.618 --> 28:25.746
Pediatric nurse?
You couldn't pay me enough.

28:26.789 --> 28:28.958
Not that he could've
had dinner, anyway.

28:28.999 --> 28:30.501
Hospital's got everyone on call.

28:30.543 --> 28:31.877
Other hospitals, too.

28:31.919 --> 28:33.712
-How come?
-I don't know.

28:33.754 --> 28:35.589
Antonio thinks
something's going on.

28:35.631 --> 28:37.007
Some kind of outbreak.

28:37.049 --> 28:39.510
Jesus. Hope not.

28:41.053 --> 28:42.555
Going somewhere?

28:43.597 --> 28:45.641
New case. All hands on deck.

28:45.683 --> 28:47.977
Just came home
to shower and change.

28:48.018 --> 28:50.020
Don't know when I'll be back.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.189
Stay in touch.

28:52.231 --> 28:54.316
Promise.

28:55.359 --> 28:57.903
Feed Coltrane for me?

28:57.945 --> 29:00.281
-I know the drill.
-(Coltrane whines)

29:00.322 --> 29:02.199
(helicopter continues whirring)

29:05.536 --> 29:07.455
Part of your case?

29:08.497 --> 29:10.124
I don't know. Maybe.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.169
Night.

29:13.210 --> 29:15.212
-Night.
-(footsteps departing)

29:23.012 --> 29:24.722
Jerry.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.599
Look at this.

29:28.767 --> 29:31.562
I ran "308" as a tattoo
through CalGang.

29:31.604 --> 29:33.439
Russ Aborn. Van Nuys.

29:33.481 --> 29:34.899
Sovereign citizen.

29:34.940 --> 29:37.359
Folsom. Serving three-to-five
for bribery

29:37.401 --> 29:38.444
and filing false documents.

29:38.486 --> 29:40.237
308?

29:40.279 --> 29:43.073
(sighs) Some so-called
sovereign citizens believe

29:43.115 --> 29:45.576
invoking Section 308 of the UCC

29:45.618 --> 29:48.412
exempts them from local,
state and federal law.

29:48.454 --> 29:50.206
That's a lot of exemption.

29:50.247 --> 29:53.459
Anything that's not
English common law, they reject.

29:53.501 --> 29:54.710
They're exempt.

29:54.752 --> 29:57.087
-Taxes?
-Taxes.

29:57.129 --> 29:59.381
Business contracts.

29:59.423 --> 30:00.716
Property deeds.

30:00.758 --> 30:02.760
They make their own
license plates,

30:02.801 --> 30:05.095
print their own currency

30:05.137 --> 30:07.348
and occupy
other people's property.

30:07.389 --> 30:09.391
Look at this.

30:12.228 --> 30:15.481
BOSCH:
"No driver's license
or insurance required."

30:15.523 --> 30:17.816
I dig that.
No standing in line at the DMV.

30:17.858 --> 30:19.944
-(both chuckle)
-Murder. What about murder?

30:19.985 --> 30:22.696
-These guys exempt from murder?
-Murder's covered by common law.

30:22.738 --> 30:24.448
So, homeboys still
on the hook for this.

30:24.490 --> 30:25.699
Oh, yeah.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.287
(keyboard clacking)

30:30.329 --> 30:32.164
(horn honking)

30:34.291 --> 30:35.960
So, Major Crimes will liaise

30:36.001 --> 30:37.836
with the Bureau
and Hollywood Homicide.

30:37.878 --> 30:40.172
Yes, sir.

30:40.214 --> 30:41.799
And in the interest
of preventing

30:41.840 --> 30:43.717
a full-blown citywide panic,

30:43.759 --> 30:46.845
let's try to keep a lid on
this bubbling cauldron of shit

30:46.887 --> 30:48.305
as long as we can.

30:49.348 --> 30:50.849
Sir.

30:52.810 --> 30:53.894
(door closes)

30:53.936 --> 30:55.688
MAPP:
Mrs. Kent all right?

30:55.729 --> 30:57.731
Must be a terrible shock.

30:57.773 --> 31:00.150
You notice anything unusual
that night?

31:01.235 --> 31:03.696
As a matter of fact,
I walked the dog late.

31:03.737 --> 31:05.864
-Around the block.
-What time was this?

31:05.906 --> 31:06.907
Midnight.

31:06.949 --> 31:09.243
There was a car
parked around the corner.

31:09.285 --> 31:12.121
Uh, some kind of black sedan.

31:12.162 --> 31:13.664
Odd license plate.

31:13.706 --> 31:16.083
-Odd how?
-Didn't look real.

31:16.125 --> 31:19.628
Sort of homemade,
like paper or cardboard.

31:19.670 --> 31:21.630
Was it a new car?

31:21.672 --> 31:24.049
The DMV issues temp plates
made out of paper.

31:24.091 --> 31:26.844
-Didn't look like a new car.
-Did you get a number?

31:26.885 --> 31:29.888
No number, just a bunch
of slashes and dashes.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.933
Fake plates. Tattoo.

31:32.975 --> 31:35.394
-Sovereigns, for sure.
-So it would seem.

31:40.524 --> 31:42.318
Look who's here.

31:44.361 --> 31:46.780
Detectives.

31:46.822 --> 31:48.741
Brings you here?

31:48.782 --> 31:49.992
Canvassing the neighborhood.

31:50.034 --> 31:51.702
You said Kent was
on a watch list.

31:51.744 --> 31:54.455
We monitored his use of
radioactive material.

31:54.496 --> 31:57.583
We met with him, made sure, uh,
he was following protocols.

31:57.625 --> 31:59.126
Kent in particular?

31:59.168 --> 32:00.586
Doctors like Kent.

32:00.628 --> 32:02.212
He ever receive threats?

32:02.254 --> 32:05.507
It's a threat-laden environment,
Detective.

32:05.549 --> 32:08.636
-Let's leave it at that.
-Eh, so, we'd like
to circle back,

32:08.677 --> 32:11.221
have a follow-up conversation
with Mrs. Kent.

32:11.263 --> 32:13.265
It's not possible at the moment.

32:13.307 --> 32:14.266
Why not?

32:14.308 --> 32:15.893
She's not here.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.479
We put her in a safe house
for the time being.

32:20.481 --> 32:23.275
So much for keeping us
in the loop.

32:24.318 --> 32:25.861
-Hey, Bosch?
-Yeah.

32:26.904 --> 32:29.365
Uh...

32:29.406 --> 32:32.451
I just wanted to say
I-I knew Eleanor Wish.

32:32.493 --> 32:34.787
I worked with her.

32:34.828 --> 32:35.996
She was a class act.

32:37.039 --> 32:38.582
That she was.

32:43.128 --> 32:45.130
What were you and Bosch
talking about yesterday?

32:45.172 --> 32:47.800
-At the scene.
-The Overlook.

32:47.841 --> 32:49.802
Beautiful morning,
day like yesterday.

32:49.843 --> 32:51.595
I was the first on the scene.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.847
Female, 20s, in her car.

32:55.265 --> 32:57.351
GSW to the heart.

32:57.393 --> 32:59.603
Bosch rolls up.
First thing he does?

32:59.645 --> 33:00.854
Moves the body.

33:00.896 --> 33:02.856
-No way.
-(chuckles)

33:02.898 --> 33:04.441
(scoffs)
First thing they teach you:

33:04.483 --> 33:06.151
don't touch the body
till the coroner comes.

33:06.193 --> 33:07.194
Right?

33:07.236 --> 33:09.863
Then he reaches under the seat,
finds a gun.

33:09.905 --> 33:11.573
Suicide.

33:11.615 --> 33:13.492
-Shot herself in the heart.
-(scoffs)

33:13.534 --> 33:15.786
Bosch just knew.
Uh, he had a hunch.

33:15.828 --> 33:18.038
Solved it on the spot.
(sniffs)

33:19.456 --> 33:21.542
-There you are.
-Lieutenant.

33:21.583 --> 33:23.043
-You off to court?
-Yeah.

33:23.085 --> 33:24.461
Oh. Pierce.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.213
-What?
-Your collar.

33:26.255 --> 33:27.631
God, men.

33:27.673 --> 33:29.967
Used to have to do this
with my ex-husband.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.136
There, you clean up good.

33:32.177 --> 33:34.346
-And you, too.
-Thank you.

33:34.388 --> 33:36.682
Listen, you did great work.

33:36.724 --> 33:38.100
Both of you.

33:38.142 --> 33:42.438
I mean, no hunches,
just good solid police work.

33:42.479 --> 33:43.439
All right?

33:43.480 --> 33:44.690
Give 'em hell.

33:47.484 --> 33:49.069
(Vega clears throat)

33:50.529 --> 33:52.239
I promise never to do that.

33:52.281 --> 33:54.324
-What?
-Fix your fucking collar.

33:54.366 --> 33:55.784
(chuckles)
You're her favorite.

33:55.826 --> 33:57.494
-Fuck off.
-Seriously.

33:57.536 --> 33:59.413
-Seriously. Fuck off.
-Mm.

33:59.455 --> 34:01.039
The woman has boundary issues.

34:01.081 --> 34:03.292
-PIERCE:
She does that to everyone.
-VEGA: Doesn't bother you?

34:03.333 --> 34:05.294
-Not particularly.
-Ah, she's so touchy-feely.

34:05.335 --> 34:06.754
-It bugs me.
-Who is?

34:06.795 --> 34:08.338
My cousin, sir.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.507
Can't keep her hands to herself.

34:10.549 --> 34:12.134
Ah.

34:12.176 --> 34:14.261
Good luck in court this week.

34:14.303 --> 34:15.929
Thank you, sir.

34:19.433 --> 34:21.727
That's disappointing.

34:21.769 --> 34:23.395
You sure?

34:23.437 --> 34:25.314
Better safe than sorry.

34:25.355 --> 34:26.440
(chuckles softly)

34:26.482 --> 34:28.650
You sound like
my grandmother, you know.

34:28.692 --> 34:32.070
"A stitch in time save nine."
(scoffs)

34:32.112 --> 34:34.072
How long?

34:34.114 --> 34:35.866
Long as it takes.

34:35.908 --> 34:37.826
When things cool off.

34:37.868 --> 34:40.412
Might have to go somewhere else
in the interim.

34:42.706 --> 34:44.249
Understandable.

34:45.292 --> 34:47.753
What's our exposure?

34:48.796 --> 34:50.380
Zero.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.966
Zero is a number
I don't believe.

34:53.008 --> 34:55.469
Zero. Guaranteed.

34:57.095 --> 34:59.473
Zero don't exist.

35:13.278 --> 35:14.696
(camera beeps, clicks)

35:21.119 --> 35:22.496
You make it clear to him.

35:22.538 --> 35:24.706
We pay him well,
and that's the deal.

35:24.748 --> 35:26.875
-I will not be beholden.
-Of course not.

35:26.917 --> 35:29.336
Not to him,
not to the donors he brings in.

35:29.378 --> 35:32.548
-That has to be understood
from the get-go.
-Ray knows that.

35:32.589 --> 35:35.467
A donation, large or small,
doesn't buy access,

35:35.509 --> 35:37.511
and it doesn't buy me.

35:37.553 --> 35:39.179
Goes without saying.

35:39.221 --> 35:43.100
I'm saying it, loud and clear.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.644
It's an investment
in the future.

35:45.686 --> 35:47.688
Of this city.

35:50.315 --> 35:52.025
(door opens)

35:57.322 --> 36:00.075
(line ringing)

36:00.117 --> 36:02.911
BOSCH (recorded):
This is Bosch. Leave a message.

36:03.954 --> 36:05.497
Where?

36:05.539 --> 36:06.957
On it.

36:08.292 --> 36:10.168
A jumped on?

36:10.210 --> 36:12.921
-Sunset and Las Palmas.
-Wow.

36:12.963 --> 36:15.215
-That's an ominous corner.
-Mm-hmm.

36:15.257 --> 36:16.550
You think, uh...?

36:16.592 --> 36:18.510
-Teddy Hobbs?
-Yeah.

36:18.552 --> 36:20.929
Ha. I'd bet on that.

36:20.971 --> 36:23.432
So would I.

36:23.473 --> 36:25.100
BOTH:
Chief.

36:33.609 --> 36:35.861
(gasps) Chief.

36:35.903 --> 36:39.114
Why the fuck
haven't I heard from Bosch?

36:40.157 --> 36:41.450
Um...

36:42.701 --> 36:44.244
(sighs)

36:44.286 --> 36:46.747
They call themselves
the Three Oh Eight Squadron.

36:46.788 --> 36:49.333
We're talking a small cell,
less than a dozen.

36:49.374 --> 36:50.876
Couple of families, basically.

36:50.918 --> 36:52.461
Social media?

36:52.502 --> 36:54.296
They've upped
their game recently.

36:54.338 --> 36:55.589
More than just talk?

36:55.631 --> 36:58.008
No overt violence yet.

36:58.050 --> 37:00.677
But real-world provocations
by local sovereigns

37:00.719 --> 37:02.095
are on the rise.

37:02.137 --> 37:04.348
Especially confrontations
with cops.

37:04.389 --> 37:06.016
Traffic stops,
station invasions.

37:06.058 --> 37:08.894
One of those in the Valley
last month. Van Nuys.

37:08.936 --> 37:10.437
Three Oh Eights were involved
in that incident.

37:10.479 --> 37:12.147
BOSCH:
So where can we find these guys?

37:12.189 --> 37:14.733
They appear in public
if they're not hassling cops?

37:14.775 --> 37:17.736
They pass out literature,
hawk their ideology.

37:17.778 --> 37:19.488
-Recruit.
-Exactly.

37:19.529 --> 37:21.198
Pancake breakfasts, barbecues.

37:21.239 --> 37:24.201
(ringtone playing)

37:24.242 --> 37:26.161
Where do I start?

37:32.000 --> 37:33.502
(door closes)

37:39.549 --> 37:41.385
Hi-yo, baby.

37:43.053 --> 37:44.680
All right,
don't forget Riverside.

37:44.721 --> 37:46.223
That all right with you, Craver?

37:46.264 --> 37:48.225
Or is it a little
out of your comfort zone?

37:48.266 --> 37:51.103
Whatever you say, Heather.
I'm down with it.

38:01.655 --> 38:03.073
(clears throat)

38:13.208 --> 38:15.335
Haven't seen you here before.

38:15.377 --> 38:19.548
Ah, a buddy said I might find
some, uh, kindred spirits here.

38:19.589 --> 38:21.550
Yeah. You well might.

38:21.591 --> 38:23.093
I'll check it out.

38:23.135 --> 38:24.344
What's your name?

38:26.471 --> 38:28.473
My friends call me Barrel.

38:30.017 --> 38:32.185
I know a fence-sitter
when I see one.

38:32.227 --> 38:33.437
Time is coming, brother.

38:33.478 --> 38:35.939
Have to choose sides.

38:35.981 --> 38:38.442
Sovereign citizens?

38:38.483 --> 38:40.318
Am I in the right place?

38:42.779 --> 38:45.490
How'd you hear about
this little get-together?

38:45.532 --> 38:46.908
Russ Aborn.

38:46.950 --> 38:49.536
Is that right? How is old Russ?

38:49.578 --> 38:53.623
-Not so good.
-Yeah. Corcoran's a tough place.

38:53.665 --> 38:56.835
Folsom. He's stuck
in Folsom prison.

38:56.877 --> 38:59.421
And time keeps dragging on.

39:03.717 --> 39:06.595
Russ has a tattoo.

39:06.636 --> 39:09.473
Three Oh Eight.
That's who I'm looking for.

39:09.514 --> 39:12.100
The Three Oh Eights.

39:12.142 --> 39:14.895
Ugh, what?

39:14.936 --> 39:16.646
Are you a cop?

39:16.688 --> 39:19.357
You carry yourself like a cop.

39:19.399 --> 39:21.318
What if I am?

39:21.359 --> 39:23.236
Are you?

39:23.278 --> 39:26.990
That's how me and Russ met.
I wrote him up for a fake plate.

39:27.032 --> 39:28.700
Fuck you.

39:28.742 --> 39:31.119
It's all right. We got cops.

39:31.161 --> 39:32.954
So I hear.

39:32.996 --> 39:34.956
Let me see some I.D.

39:34.998 --> 39:36.583
Fuck you.

39:36.625 --> 39:39.252
I wipe my ass with that shit.

39:39.294 --> 39:42.547
Free man don't need
no government-issue I.D.

39:45.258 --> 39:47.260

39:49.304 --> 39:50.847
Are you a drinking man?

39:50.889 --> 39:52.224
Of course.

39:54.476 --> 39:57.479
There's a tavern
out in Canoga Park.

39:59.064 --> 40:02.359
Bartender has
a very, very heavy pour.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.194

40:06.404 --> 40:08.365
Hey, hey. Thanks, brother.

40:09.533 --> 40:10.909

40:10.951 --> 40:13.328
How bad could it be?

40:13.370 --> 40:15.372
-Later, gator.
-Later.

40:17.541 --> 40:19.751
(engine starts)

40:24.256 --> 40:27.968
If this goes sideways
in any way, I'm done.

40:29.761 --> 40:32.973
Great leaders are
forged in crisis.

40:35.559 --> 40:37.769
Sorry. I-I know
that sounded self-serving.

40:37.811 --> 40:40.438
Of course I'm concerned
for the citizens

40:40.480 --> 40:42.274
of this city above all else.

40:42.315 --> 40:44.776
I know that.

40:44.818 --> 40:46.486
And they do, too.

40:49.614 --> 40:51.241

40:57.789 --> 41:00.750
You sure you won't join me?
God knows we deserve it.

41:00.792 --> 41:03.295
I can't.

41:03.336 --> 41:05.755
Why not?

41:05.797 --> 41:07.465
I'm pregnant.

41:27.569 --> 41:29.321

-He or she might.

41:56.306 --> 41:57.724
He won't.

41:58.767 --> 42:00.518
