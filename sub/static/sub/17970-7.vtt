00:49.591 --> 00:53.428
Once there was a man
who lived forever.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.900
He fell in love with a peasant girl.

01:21.832 --> 01:23.082
They were married.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.715
But her heart belonged to another.

01:37.681 --> 01:40.016
He gave her his title.

01:40.225 --> 01:42.393
She gave him a bastard.

01:43.270 --> 01:48.691
Look! It's the cuckold! Cuckold! Cuckold!

01:50.652 --> 01:53.029
The pain was unbearable.

02:03.332 --> 02:07.335
He vowed never to feel
such pain again.

02:25.604 --> 02:27.438
Never again.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.774
He made a promise to himself
on that terrible night.

02:31.193 --> 02:34.153
A promise he has kept
for over 400 years.

02:34.363 --> 02:37.156
And this is the immortal
who can stop Ilaria? This murderer?

02:37.366 --> 02:41.118
Don't be obtuse.
I have full faith in Michael's talent.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.663
He's been working on a project
with implications...

02:43.831 --> 02:45.873
...greater than even he realizes.

02:46.083 --> 02:48.584
What he's done is remarkable.

02:48.794 --> 02:50.962
-Genius, even.
-What's the project?

02:51.171 --> 02:54.507
A world where only one field
yields a crop...

02:55.050 --> 02:56.843
...while the rest lie barren.

02:59.263 --> 03:00.638
-Infertility?
-That's right.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.140
Michael has perfected it.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.434
Grafted it into apples.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.645
One dose. No side effects.

03:07.855 --> 03:11.232
Simple, elegant, guaranteed results.

03:11.441 --> 03:14.569
And the best part,
it only affects mortal men.

03:15.112 --> 03:17.405
So no one else can father children
except for him.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.532
And any other immortal man.

03:20.951 --> 03:24.412
With that technology, Ilaria could control
the spread of mortal population.

03:24.580 --> 03:26.831
Without resorting to genocide, yes.

03:27.291 --> 03:31.002
It would solve their human problem
once and for all.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.503
Where do I find this Michael?

03:32.713 --> 03:35.882
On an island on the far end
of the New World.

03:38.093 --> 03:40.094
Then that's where I need to go.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.863
Search parties have been
looking all night.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.240
So far, they've only found four
of the infected.

04:01.450 --> 04:04.911
The others are being hidden
somewhere on the grounds.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.537
Have you seen my budding knife?

04:06.747 --> 04:08.915
-No.
-I keep it in the second drawer.

04:09.124 --> 04:10.625
And it's not there.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.795
-Maybe you put it in a different drawer.
-I would never do that.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.423
You know how you get
when you're working.

04:17.633 --> 04:20.676
I need to have things kept
in their proper places.

04:20.886 --> 04:22.553
Agnes always....

04:26.308 --> 04:30.436
The lab needs to be kept organized.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.481
-I will have Landry prepare an inventory.
-No, no, no.

04:33.690 --> 04:36.025
Not Landry, you.

04:37.069 --> 04:39.737
Without Agnes or Anne,
I need you on top of things.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.739
Of course, Michael.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.742
Do you want the search teams
to keep looking?

04:44.952 --> 04:46.077
Well, why wouldn't they?

04:46.286 --> 04:50.164
I told you,
the sick are being kept hidden from us.

04:50.374 --> 04:53.084
The healthy are getting scared.

04:53.251 --> 04:55.461
-People are talking about leaving.
-Who?

04:57.047 --> 04:58.714
People.

05:00.175 --> 05:03.928
Gather everyone in the dining hall.
I'm gonna make an announcement.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.533
Who's there?

05:29.371 --> 05:32.873
It's Anne, Dr. Farragut.

05:34.126 --> 05:35.710
Anne?

05:37.337 --> 05:38.504
What are you doing here?

05:38.964 --> 05:41.924
I was framed for something I didn't do.

05:42.926 --> 05:45.553
Framed? By who?

05:46.596 --> 05:48.347
I don't know.

05:49.433 --> 05:52.143
But it won't be long
before Michael realizes his mistake.

05:52.352 --> 05:55.312
He doesn't seem like the type
who makes mistakes.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.442
This is just a detour from my path.

06:00.402 --> 06:01.736
Yeah.

06:01.945 --> 06:06.240
Nothing like a road trip
through Ratville to build character.

06:09.244 --> 06:10.786
Michael needs me.

06:14.166 --> 06:15.791
When the time is right...

06:17.794 --> 06:19.128
...he'll come.

06:26.136 --> 06:30.264
You look like 10 miles of bad road.
Wanna tell me where you were all night?

06:34.102 --> 06:38.481
I had a wonderful night myself.
The room-to-room search was a bust.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.900
Turns out Olivia and her merry crew...

06:41.068 --> 06:44.236
...are better at stashing the sick
than we expected.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.129
Eighty-three Mycotics,
and we only found four.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.757
Looks like the sedative is wearing off.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.051
This place is about
to be turned upside down.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.929
-Have you seen Sarah?
-I figured she was with you.

07:11.515 --> 07:13.933
No. I checked her room.

07:14.142 --> 07:16.477
She wasn't there.
I thought I'd check the lab next.

07:16.686 --> 07:18.354
I'll come with you.

07:22.818 --> 07:24.610
-They were in here.
-Come on.

07:24.778 --> 07:25.986
Where are our families?

07:27.072 --> 07:29.824
-Friends.
-Please. Where are the sick?

07:30.033 --> 07:32.743
Friends. Friends, please.

07:33.662 --> 07:36.831
-Where are the others?
-Please. Please.

07:39.459 --> 07:43.546
We tried to isolate the sick,
and we failed.

07:44.005 --> 07:48.384
But we must do what we can to protect
the uninfected, which is all of you.

07:48.593 --> 07:51.679
I think the doctors from the CDC
would agree...

07:52.472 --> 07:56.767
...that this dining hall is currently
the safest place in the Abbey.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.018
Good.

07:58.228 --> 08:01.522
So we are all going to stay
in this room.

08:01.731 --> 08:05.609
And no one will leave until this is over.

08:07.028 --> 08:09.113
Some of us have family out there.

08:10.157 --> 08:14.076
All of us have family
out there, Malcolm.

08:14.286 --> 08:18.706
-The healthy will be redirected back here.
-And the sick? What about them?

08:19.249 --> 08:21.500
We just leave them out there to die?

08:21.710 --> 08:23.210
Yes.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.629
Unless we all want to die
along with them.

08:26.715 --> 08:30.009
It is in times of unimaginable loss...

08:30.218 --> 08:34.680
...that adherence to our own true path
is most vital!

08:43.773 --> 08:45.399
We can't do that!

08:55.911 --> 08:56.952
We trusted you!

09:04.836 --> 09:08.380
Place guards at every entrance.
Lock it down now.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.842
Sarah.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.225
You said you checked her room?

09:23.772 --> 09:25.814
Alan, hey. You okay?

09:27.108 --> 09:29.193
I think I know where she is.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.611
There's a room...

09:32.197 --> 09:33.697
...in one of the outbuildings.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.993
I almost made it there once, but I was
ambushed before I could find proof.

09:38.203 --> 09:41.914
-Proof of what?
-I came to this island for a reason.

09:42.123 --> 09:44.625
And I believe it's buried in this Abbey.

10:28.503 --> 10:30.713
Yes. We've been here before.

10:30.922 --> 10:32.589
Haven't we?

10:34.134 --> 10:35.843
Blights.

10:36.386 --> 10:37.803
Plagues. Drought.

10:38.555 --> 10:44.310
Parasites. There's so many ways
to devastate an orchard.

10:46.187 --> 10:49.565
We built this place up from nothing.

10:49.941 --> 10:51.525
Persevered through...

10:52.027 --> 10:54.778
...unimaginable hardships.

10:56.197 --> 10:58.991
But when a disease attacks the roots...

10:59.451 --> 11:01.744
...changes are necessary.

11:04.080 --> 11:07.624
Astrid, do you remember
when the Spanish found us?

11:09.210 --> 11:12.129
Your sacrifice was...

11:12.297 --> 11:14.089
...heroic.

11:16.676 --> 11:20.554
And your daughter, sweet Annabel.

11:21.097 --> 11:24.975
You nurtured the seeds
of a generation.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.228
Alice.

11:28.438 --> 11:31.023
Without you,
there'd be no fellowship.

11:31.232 --> 11:36.487
The old ways needed to be discarded
so your new ideas could come to fruition.

11:36.696 --> 11:40.115
Pruning a plant makes it grow.

11:40.283 --> 11:43.619
Thinning a crop makes it strong.

11:43.828 --> 11:46.038
Who are you talking to?

11:49.959 --> 11:51.460
Amy.

11:52.087 --> 11:53.837
Do you have something to say to me?

11:55.757 --> 11:57.383
Brother Malcolm.

11:58.009 --> 11:59.885
The one who attacked you.

12:00.095 --> 12:02.763
Landry had him taken down
to a contemplation cell.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.891
No, no, I don't want that.
I don't want him to be locked away.

12:06.101 --> 12:09.520
-Let him stay with the others.
-But he transgressed.

12:11.272 --> 12:13.649
-You're not concerned?
-Quite the contrary.

12:14.484 --> 12:17.820
Vigorous dissent
is sometimes healthy.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.989
But you always say
how one bad apple--

12:21.199 --> 12:23.575
Now I'm saying something different.

12:28.289 --> 12:30.874
-Is there a problem with that?
-Of course not.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.709
But why--?

12:35.004 --> 12:36.422
Do you see these women?

12:37.507 --> 12:39.508
Your sisters.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.593
Each and every one of them...

12:41.803 --> 12:44.430
...dedicated their lives
to this fellowship.

12:45.098 --> 12:48.892
They did everything
that was asked of them...

12:49.269 --> 12:52.271
...without question, without complaint.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.108
They lived happily...

12:56.693 --> 12:58.652
...in the service...

12:59.112 --> 13:01.155
...of my will.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.032
No matter the demand.

13:04.242 --> 13:06.577
No matter the sacrifice.

13:07.579 --> 13:11.248
That proud mantle
is being passed to you.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.709
Are you ready to receive it, Amy?

13:15.211 --> 13:16.753
Are you?

13:53.041 --> 13:56.460
Dr. Farragut? Are you asleep?

13:58.880 --> 14:00.422
Call me Peter.

14:01.299 --> 14:08.222
I wanted to apologize on behalf of our
fellowship for the way things turned out.

14:08.848 --> 14:13.060
You came here to help us,
and I'm afraid we've been...

14:13.269 --> 14:14.978
...less than forthcoming.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.608
"Less than forthcoming"?

14:20.068 --> 14:22.653
-Are you out of your goddamn mind?
-I just thought--

14:22.862 --> 14:26.240
Michael dumped a barrel of rats
on my head.

14:26.449 --> 14:29.618
In what world do you think
I would ever accept an apology from you?

14:29.786 --> 14:32.287
-Please don't yell at me.
-I have been locked in a pit.

14:32.497 --> 14:35.082
-Please don't.
-Tortured. Starved half to death--

14:35.291 --> 14:37.584
Stop yelling at me!

14:40.880 --> 14:45.259
Do you have any idea how hard it is
to be the sensible one all the time?

14:45.468 --> 14:48.679
I try to do what's right for our people...

14:48.888 --> 14:51.181
...and this is how I'm thanked.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.268
I know exactly how you feel.

14:55.979 --> 14:59.898
-How could you?
-Let's just say I face similar...

15:00.108 --> 15:02.693
...challenges in my line of work.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.071
Try working with your family.

15:06.281 --> 15:08.365
-I have.
-It's the worst.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.368
The absolute pits.

15:24.549 --> 15:26.133
Anne?

15:26.342 --> 15:28.302
Are you down here?

15:28.511 --> 15:30.220
Amy.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.347
What's wrong? Is Michael coming?

15:33.224 --> 15:34.433
No.

15:34.642 --> 15:36.852
-I don't know what to do.
-How about throwing a rope?

15:37.061 --> 15:39.896
-Tell me.
-I think Michael's going crazy.

15:40.106 --> 15:43.942
-He was talking to the portraits on the wall.
-What was he saying?

15:44.319 --> 15:47.237
Something about the crop.
It didn't make any sense.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.824
He doesn't always make sense,
but it's your job to protect him now.

15:51.034 --> 15:54.369
To bow to his will.
Do you understand?

15:54.579 --> 15:56.163
You sound exactly like him.

15:56.372 --> 15:58.332
Maybe we could talk about this up top.

15:58.541 --> 16:01.877
-Gotta be a rope somewhere.
-I'm not leaving until Michael releases me.

16:02.837 --> 16:05.172
-Are you kidding me?
-Amy, listen to me.

16:05.381 --> 16:08.383
You will go to him
and you will offer yourself.

16:08.593 --> 16:13.055
No. I don't have to listen to you
and I don't have to listen to him.

16:13.264 --> 16:15.182
Amy, just throw down
a goddamn rope.

16:15.391 --> 16:16.475
Or him either.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.518
Amy!

16:18.853 --> 16:20.270
Amy!

16:30.448 --> 16:32.449
I am so sorry for this.

17:07.235 --> 17:09.569
Oh, my God. You scared me.

17:10.279 --> 17:11.530
Where are your parents?

17:11.739 --> 17:13.657
Our dad got sick.

17:14.409 --> 17:16.827
-Then he hurt our mom.
-Where's your dad now?

17:17.036 --> 17:19.955
Lizzie? Luke?
Hey, where are you guys?

17:20.164 --> 17:22.916
-That's him.
-Hey, kids, come on out.

17:23.126 --> 17:25.001
We're gonna play a little game.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.004
It's gonna be okay.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.006
It's okay.

17:30.216 --> 17:33.260
Lizzie? Luke?

17:34.637 --> 17:36.513
Come on, guys.

17:39.934 --> 17:42.018
I know you're in there.

17:59.412 --> 18:03.749
You're gonna be in so much trouble
unless you come out right now!

18:04.459 --> 18:07.294
Open the goddamn door!

18:09.797 --> 18:12.549
Open the door!

18:57.136 --> 18:59.763
He's gone. You guys stay right here,
and I'll be back.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.556
No, don't leave us.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.559
-I have to go and find help.
-Take us with you.

19:04.769 --> 19:07.270
-I can't. It's not safe.
-Please. Don't leave us.

19:14.821 --> 19:18.865
Stay close to me. If you hear anything
scary, you run as fast as you can, okay?

19:21.953 --> 19:23.912
Okay. Come on.

19:42.056 --> 19:44.057
How long does the psychosis last?

19:44.267 --> 19:46.685
Who knows? They're all dead
within two days anyway.

19:46.894 --> 19:48.603
It's not a very efficient pathogen.

19:48.813 --> 19:50.939
Seems to be doing a fair job
kicking our ass.

19:51.148 --> 19:54.776
An infectious disease doesn't want to kill.
It wants to pass on its DNA.

19:54.986 --> 19:58.113
This one kills too quickly.
Doesn't give itself a chance to spread.

19:58.322 --> 20:02.325
I took cellular biology. You got
a hypothesis to go along with that?

20:02.535 --> 20:05.161
Yeah. I think it had help.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.080
The human kind.

20:11.627 --> 20:13.587
This is as far as I got last time.

20:20.344 --> 20:22.137
I thought one of these would work.

20:22.346 --> 20:23.972
Stand back.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.162
What the hell is this place?

20:51.167 --> 20:53.376
Sarah was...

20:55.922 --> 20:58.048
...on this table. She was....

21:01.093 --> 21:02.552
They were...

21:03.429 --> 21:05.347
...performing some kind of procedure.

21:05.556 --> 21:07.432
Who? What did they do to her?

21:08.184 --> 21:09.809
There was so much...

21:11.395 --> 21:13.146
...blood. I-- I-- I--

21:13.981 --> 21:16.816
-I don't remember.
-What the hell are we doing here?

21:17.026 --> 21:19.319
What are you not telling me?

21:24.992 --> 21:26.785
Ilaria...

21:27.244 --> 21:30.956
...are working on something big,
an alternative to Narvik.

21:31.165 --> 21:33.500
You're telling me Ilaria
is responsible for Narvik?

21:33.918 --> 21:35.043
And more.

21:35.252 --> 21:38.046
And it's not the pathogen
you're chasing.

21:38.255 --> 21:42.008
That's unreliable.
It's faulty. It kills too quickly.

21:42.218 --> 21:44.511
-That's insane.
-Sarah....

21:45.346 --> 21:47.430
Sarah's part of it.
Must be why they took her.

21:47.598 --> 21:49.057
Bullshit.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.896
Your eyes.

21:55.606 --> 21:57.899
-What?
-Nystagmus.

21:58.275 --> 22:01.736
A residual tremor. You're sure you
don't remember anything from last night?

22:02.905 --> 22:05.615
Just flashes.

22:08.619 --> 22:10.245
I've seen this before.

22:10.454 --> 22:13.581
Those kids who attacked me,
they had the same eye movements...

22:13.791 --> 22:16.835
...and no memory of it.
I think they were drugged.

22:17.044 --> 22:18.670
Could have been an...

22:18.879 --> 22:21.256
...anticholinergic.

22:21.465 --> 22:22.632
Like scopolamine.

22:23.050 --> 22:24.968
-Okay.
-Combined with morphine...

22:25.177 --> 22:30.181
...it creates a somnambulant state
like sleepwalking.

22:32.101 --> 22:34.227
We need to find Sarah.

22:34.437 --> 22:36.438
We'll split up,
cover more ground that way.

22:36.647 --> 22:38.648
-You sure that's a good idea?
-No.

22:39.525 --> 22:42.944
But I'm all out of good ideas.

22:44.113 --> 22:47.657
When you fight like this, does she ever
come back? Try to make it right?

22:48.701 --> 22:50.618
-Amy is--
-No, no.

22:50.911 --> 22:53.496
Don't tell me.
She's following her damn path.

22:54.331 --> 22:55.915
I know you mock us.

22:56.584 --> 23:01.796
But this fellowship has thrived
for nearly 400 years.

23:02.298 --> 23:04.716
Michael knows what he's doing.

23:05.342 --> 23:06.926
I'm the one who's failed.

23:14.518 --> 23:16.352
You gave your life to him.

23:17.605 --> 23:19.189
Look what he's done to you.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.900
If this is my final journey...

23:22.610 --> 23:24.944
...I have no one to blame but myself.

23:26.530 --> 23:29.991
Everyone you have ever known
is in grave danger...

23:30.201 --> 23:32.118
...not to mention my team.

23:32.328 --> 23:34.913
Someone needs to talk to Michael...

23:35.122 --> 23:36.664
...make him see reason.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.251
Why would he listen to me?

23:42.755 --> 23:44.881
Because you're the sensible one.

24:05.986 --> 24:07.237
Sarah?

24:07.446 --> 24:08.530
You in here?

26:17.368 --> 26:19.869
I miss my mommy.

26:20.454 --> 26:23.039
Luke, Luke, Luke. It's okay. It's okay.

26:23.249 --> 26:25.875
No, when he gets scared,
you have to tell him a story.

26:26.669 --> 26:28.753
That's what our mom does.

26:28.963 --> 26:30.296
I mean did.

26:33.384 --> 26:34.425
Okay.

26:34.969 --> 26:36.844
Six months ago, I was in the Congo--

26:37.054 --> 26:39.722
No, you have to say,
"Once upon a time."

26:40.266 --> 26:41.724
Okay.

26:41.934 --> 26:44.269
Once upon a time, six months ago...

26:44.436 --> 26:47.522
...I was in the Congo treating children
a little older than you.

26:47.731 --> 26:50.233
There I met this little boy
named Arthur...

26:50.442 --> 26:52.068
...and he was a very brave boy.

26:52.278 --> 26:55.822
He used to have a blanket that he would
tie around his shoulders like a cape.

26:56.031 --> 26:59.993
I asked him one day, I said, "Why do you
tie a blanket around your shoulders?"

27:00.202 --> 27:04.455
And he said, "Because I'm Superman,
and Superman can fly.

27:04.665 --> 27:08.876
And he'll never get sick because
he can fly away from any disease."

27:13.674 --> 27:15.133
Did Arthur get better?

27:16.760 --> 27:18.469
Yeah, he did.

27:18.679 --> 27:20.263
He got better.

27:23.309 --> 27:25.643
Gosh, I sure did miss you guys.

27:25.853 --> 27:27.145
Run.

27:27.896 --> 27:29.439
Run.

27:38.741 --> 27:40.033
Hey, kids.

27:41.243 --> 27:43.870
-Have you found a new mommy already?
-Guys, run. Now.

27:51.128 --> 27:52.628
Sarah. You okay?

27:52.838 --> 27:54.297
Yeah. What did you give him?

27:54.506 --> 27:57.383
Nothing.
I didn't have a chance to inject him.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.428
Rapid fungal overgrowth.

28:00.637 --> 28:02.889
It must be the final stage of the disease.

28:03.098 --> 28:05.058
And only 36 hours after the memorial.

28:05.893 --> 28:09.228
-It kills faster than we thought.
-We need to assess the mortality rate.

28:09.438 --> 28:11.856
Figure out why the boy, Soren,
went into remission.

28:12.066 --> 28:14.359
Maybe something with
a prepubescent immune system.

28:14.526 --> 28:17.528
Alan. He's their father.

28:19.823 --> 28:21.657
Kids, you okay?

28:21.950 --> 28:24.535
Why don't you come with us?
We'll go to the dining hall.

28:24.745 --> 28:28.456
-They're gathering people. You'll be safe.
-Alan. I have to go to the infirmary.

28:32.419 --> 28:34.796
They have an ultrasound machine there.

28:48.560 --> 28:49.977
Michael.

28:50.437 --> 28:51.437
We need to talk.

28:54.316 --> 28:58.236
I'm a grown woman, and I should
be able to make my own choices.

28:58.404 --> 29:01.906
-Follow your own path, of course.
-I don't want to be just another portrait.

29:02.574 --> 29:06.202
Your fierce individuality has always been
a source of great pride to me, Amy.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.162
Let's cut the bullshit.

29:13.252 --> 29:14.377
Very well.

29:17.714 --> 29:19.924
You want to speak candidly?

29:21.635 --> 29:22.844
The floor is yours.

29:23.887 --> 29:25.888
I know what you are.

29:26.390 --> 29:28.349
You're not a god.

29:28.559 --> 29:29.892
You're a freak of nature.

29:30.978 --> 29:33.229
And just because you had
Anne and Agnes fooled...

29:33.397 --> 29:36.732
...doesn't mean
you get to steal my life too.

29:37.443 --> 29:42.780
My path does not lead
to your side or your bed.

29:44.616 --> 29:45.992
May I be candid as well?

29:51.999 --> 29:54.500
I know what you are too.

29:54.877 --> 29:58.087
A chip off the old block.

29:58.297 --> 30:01.883
And I know what you had Landry do
with the tainted honey.

30:02.092 --> 30:04.343
I don't know what
you're talking about--

30:04.553 --> 30:08.181
To quote my sweet daughter,
"Let's cut the bullshit."

30:10.684 --> 30:12.643
If it was me, why put Anne in the pit?

30:12.853 --> 30:14.854
Oh, Anne is a sheep.

30:15.063 --> 30:17.565
Like so many of the others,
she was born to follow.

30:17.733 --> 30:20.818
But you, you my dear...

30:21.028 --> 30:24.989
...are a genuine
Machiavellian prodigy.

30:25.949 --> 30:29.827
Think I wasn't aware of the adolescent
fumblings between you and Landry?

30:30.579 --> 30:32.622
He's not man enough for you,
of course.

30:32.831 --> 30:35.583
But then again, none of them are.
I made sure of that.

30:37.377 --> 30:39.504
This crop is rotten.

30:39.880 --> 30:42.340
It needs to be plowed under.

30:42.549 --> 30:47.303
And tonight, we shall finish
what you and your lover started.

30:49.598 --> 30:53.392
Thinning is a necessary part
to what we do.

30:54.937 --> 30:57.313
-"Thinning"?
-Monkshood and opium poppy.

30:57.523 --> 30:59.273
A four-to-one ratio.

30:59.483 --> 31:01.859
Muscles are paralyzed,
breathing stops.

31:02.069 --> 31:03.694
And death comes as a quick release.

31:04.488 --> 31:05.821
You're going to kill them?

31:06.740 --> 31:09.450
They're at the end of their path.
I have no choice.

31:09.618 --> 31:14.121
I'm thinking of a pure community
this time.

31:14.331 --> 31:16.499
No outsiders, just family.

31:16.708 --> 31:19.126
I.... I don't understand.

31:19.336 --> 31:23.756
After the first purge,
your sister Annabel bore me 17 children.

31:24.758 --> 31:28.469
Alice gave me 22
after the second one.

31:28.971 --> 31:34.809
Oh, my dear, your life is about to be filled
with glorious purpose.

31:35.644 --> 31:40.940
My sweet girl, you're going to be
the mother to a whole new generation.

31:42.359 --> 31:43.859
No.

31:44.653 --> 31:47.029
-I won't do it.
-Oh, of course you will.

31:47.239 --> 31:50.616
With or without your teeth.

31:53.161 --> 31:54.495
No!

31:54.705 --> 31:55.788
No, please. Let me go.

31:56.373 --> 31:59.959
No, let go. Let me go.

32:01.003 --> 32:02.587
No!

32:04.923 --> 32:07.174
Let me out. Let me out, Michael.

32:07.384 --> 32:10.386
Tempered glass, won't break.

32:10.804 --> 32:12.805
I wouldn't move around
too much, Amy.

32:13.015 --> 32:17.184
Even the slightest contact with some of
those plants can be extremely dangerous.

32:17.853 --> 32:19.520
Oh, Amy.

32:19.730 --> 32:21.480
I admire your fire...

32:21.690 --> 32:24.233
...your refusal to give in.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.319
But eventually you'll understand...

32:26.778 --> 32:28.821
...just like the others.

32:29.406 --> 32:30.948
Of all my daughters...

32:34.286 --> 32:36.454
...you've always been my favorite.

32:41.710 --> 32:47.256
This machine must be 40 years old.
The CPU could be shot.

32:48.133 --> 32:50.217
It seems to be working just fine.

32:51.803 --> 32:56.098
But Sarah, still the fetus
would be very small.

32:56.308 --> 32:59.518
You couldn't have been more than
a few days pregnant when you were--

33:00.312 --> 33:01.687
You were made immortal.

33:02.856 --> 33:06.525
The baby shouldn't arrest development
until the fetal stages.

33:07.235 --> 33:09.862
We should be able to see something.

33:10.447 --> 33:13.991
Do you remember anything
from last night? Anything at all?

33:14.201 --> 33:16.702
I was in the lab,
and then I was attacked.

33:16.912 --> 33:21.082
It must have been a Mycotic.
And the next thing I know, I was in--

33:21.291 --> 33:25.670
I was in that horrible room.
And there was blood everywhere.

33:30.801 --> 33:32.385
There's nothing here.

33:33.136 --> 33:35.012
There's no baby.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.360
Sarah.

33:49.986 --> 33:53.531
I don't think that was any Mycotic attack
last night.

33:56.410 --> 33:58.703
-What?
-I lost time.

33:59.913 --> 34:01.706
Just like you.

34:01.915 --> 34:06.377
I think I was-- I was drugged
with scopolamine so I would forget.

34:06.586 --> 34:08.504
To make you forget what?

34:09.673 --> 34:12.758
I've been remembering
bits and pieces all day.

34:15.137 --> 34:18.180
But I think I was the one
who attacked you in the lab.

34:18.390 --> 34:20.474
-It was you?
-If it was...

34:20.684 --> 34:22.768
...I swear I had no idea
what was happening.

34:24.104 --> 34:26.439
You attacked me?
You took it? You took the baby?

34:26.648 --> 34:30.693
Sarah, I swear on my life
I didn't know what was happening.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.778
Do you really hate immortals
that much?

34:32.988 --> 34:33.988
No.

34:34.197 --> 34:36.782
Is that it? Do I disgust you?
Did this baby disgust you?

34:36.992 --> 34:38.617
-No, that's insane.
-No. Admit it.

34:38.785 --> 34:42.580
This is what you wanted all along. You
never wanted this baby in the first place.

34:42.789 --> 34:44.290
-That's not true.
-Get out, Alan.

34:44.499 --> 34:45.916
-I don't want to look at you.
-Please.

34:46.126 --> 34:47.501
Get out.

34:49.296 --> 34:50.755
Get out.

35:05.896 --> 35:07.980
Kyle. Let me out, please.

35:08.190 --> 35:10.149
-Michael's gone crazy.
-Stop the presses.

35:10.358 --> 35:13.110
He's about to do something terrible.
You have to believe me.

35:13.320 --> 35:14.361
Actually, I don't.

35:14.571 --> 35:19.325
See, that's the beauty of me standing
here and you being locked in there.

35:19.534 --> 35:22.495
Look, you want to find
Dr. Jordan, right?

35:23.079 --> 35:25.247
-I can tell you where she is.
-What do you know?

35:26.082 --> 35:29.668
-Let me out and I'll tell you.
-Tell me and I'll think about letting you out.

35:32.297 --> 35:35.758
Well, you know what?
I like you better under glass.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.551
What? No, Kyle!

35:38.094 --> 35:39.929
Please.

35:41.765 --> 35:43.182
Okay.

35:43.725 --> 35:47.394
You ready to try again?
Get back on my shoulder.

35:50.732 --> 35:52.399
Peter, is that you?

35:52.609 --> 35:53.943
Oh, Kyle. Thank God.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.028
How did you two end up down there?

35:56.238 --> 35:58.405
There should be a rope somewhere.

35:58.615 --> 36:01.534
-Copy that.
-We need a sit-rep. What's happening?

36:01.743 --> 36:03.077
What isn't happening?

36:03.286 --> 36:06.330
There was another outbreak, 83 infected.

36:07.040 --> 36:08.082
Jesus.

36:08.291 --> 36:10.459
Quarantine was breached.
Most are on the loose.

36:10.627 --> 36:13.671
-And the uninfected?
-Michael confined them to the dining hall.

36:13.839 --> 36:15.714
Have you seen Michael?
Is he all right?

36:15.924 --> 36:17.925
He was in the botany lab
arguing with Amy.

36:18.134 --> 36:20.970
Brewing up some kind of foul-smelling
plant stew. Got it.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.680
Great. Throw it down.

36:23.223 --> 36:24.974
All right. Look out.

36:25.725 --> 36:27.142
What kind of plant stew?

36:27.310 --> 36:29.353
I don't know.
Long stems, big purple flowers.

36:30.730 --> 36:33.232
Monkshood. Also known as aconitum.

36:33.775 --> 36:36.986
That's a deadly paralytic.
Why would he--?

36:39.239 --> 36:40.656
Hey.

36:43.243 --> 36:44.660
It's a Thinning.

36:45.078 --> 36:46.078
A what?

36:47.789 --> 36:52.543
It was before my time, but I heard
the stories from my great-grandmother.

36:52.752 --> 36:57.339
When she was a young girl, a decision
was made to thin the fellowship.

36:57.549 --> 37:00.092
To wipe the slate clean and start over.

37:02.262 --> 37:03.387
Start over how?

37:05.181 --> 37:06.807
She's talking about Jonestown.

37:08.643 --> 37:10.936
Solar Temple.

37:11.146 --> 37:12.980
Heaven's Gate.

37:13.356 --> 37:14.690
Mass suicide.

37:16.985 --> 37:19.486
They're all gonna kill themselves.

37:26.202 --> 37:27.244
Friends.

37:27.787 --> 37:29.204
Friends.

37:29.748 --> 37:33.167
Wonderful news. Wonderful news.

37:33.460 --> 37:36.170
The good doctors from the CDC
have developed a serum...

37:36.379 --> 37:39.798
...to combat the illness
which has been plaguing our fellowship.

37:43.845 --> 37:47.932
They're administering it right now
to the sick outside.

37:48.141 --> 37:51.685
And they've even provided us
with an oral vaccine...

37:51.895 --> 37:54.897
...so that we might not
become infected either.

37:55.065 --> 37:57.149
Glorious, glorious news.

38:01.029 --> 38:02.488
I want you to take your men.

38:02.697 --> 38:05.407
I need you outside on the perimeter.

38:05.617 --> 38:09.119
-When do we get the cure?
-Now is not the time to ask me questions.

38:15.043 --> 38:16.085
Is it safe?

38:19.881 --> 38:21.799
I thought you might ask me that.

38:39.859 --> 38:41.235
See?

38:41.444 --> 38:43.028
Totally painless.

38:58.586 --> 39:00.212
This way. Come on.

39:03.466 --> 39:07.052
Parents, administer to your children.

39:08.054 --> 39:11.348
Men, aid our women
before helping yourself.

39:14.811 --> 39:18.105
To the elderly,
please offer them assistance.

39:19.149 --> 39:22.401
More than enough to go around.
