He was dying.

37:53.646 --> 37:55.807
Every part of his body was failing.

37:55.982 --> 37:57.973
He was impatient for it to end.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.818
He'd asked to be disconnected

38:01.988 --> 38:06.652

He was in pain and suffering.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.655
And he wasn't thinking clearly.

38:09.829 --> 38:15.074
If he were, he would never have chosen
to tell you any of it.

38:15.460 --> 38:17.621
It wasn't his choice to make.
