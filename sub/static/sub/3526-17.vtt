NEVER CARED FOR HIM.

05:33.967 --> 05:37.237
HE TRIED TO SET UP THIS
OTHER ROOKIE, FEMALE,

05:40.640 --> 05:43.777
LISTEN, THAT SUBJECT
WE TALKED ABOUT--

05:43.843 --> 05:46.246
IF I WAS
TO KNOW SOMETHING

IS LETTER WOULD BE
PLACED IN YOUR FILE

AND IF YOU WERE EVER
CONVICTED OF A CRIME...

06:10.737 --> 06:13.473
IT'D BE PRESENTED
TO A JUDGE WHEN HE OR SHE

06:13.606 --> 06:16.876
WOULD BE CONSIDERING
SENTENCING GUIDELINES.

06:22.115 --> 06:24.184
WELL, THERE WERE
A COUPLE OF GUYS,

06:24.284 --> 06:27.053
I DON'T KNOW, ARABS,
ARABIANS MAYBE.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.522
THEY USED TO HANG AROUND
THE BING,

06:29.556 --> 06:31.691
AND SOMEBODY I KNEW

06:31.791 --> 06:34.461
MAY HAVE DID SOME
BUSINESS WITH THEM.

06:34.561 --> 06:37.330

THESE TWO,
YOU KNOW, DRINKING

06:44.137 --> 06:46.306

THEY DISAPPEARED,

06:48.308 --> 06:50.744
D I MEAN COMPLETELY.

06:50.810 --> 06:53.146

14:27.300 --> 14:30.603
- LESS FILLING,
TASTES LIKE ASS.
- ( laughs )

14:33.006 --> 14:34.941
( sighs )

14:35.008 --> 14:36.609
THIS IS NICE.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.611
ABOUT TIME YOU INVITED
EVERYBODY OVER.

14:38.712 --> 14:40.547
IT WAS KELLI'S IDEA.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.816
SHE'S BEEN WANTING
TO GET HER TEETH WET
WITH THE ENTERTAINING.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.951
GOOD THING,
ELSE I'D NEVER SEE YOU.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.686
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

14:46.786 --> 14:49.122
- STEAK'S DONE.
- YOU THINK SO?

14:49.189 --> 14:51.358
IT KEEPS COOKING
EVEN IF IT'S OFF
THE FLAME.

14:51.458 --> 14:54.127
THE JUICES.

14:56.529 --> 14:59.299
SO WHAT'S UP
WITH YOU?

14:59.366 --> 15:00.667
YOU'VE BEEN
LIKE A GHOST LATELY.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.635
YOU'RE AROUND ONE SECOND,
NEXT THING YOU'RE GONE.

15:02.736 --> 15:05.238
- I WAS BY THE BING
THE OTHER DAY.
- FOR, LIKE, FIVE MINUTES.

15:05.372 --> 15:08.475
YOU KNOW, YOU OF
ALL PEOPLE SHOULD
UNDERSTAND HOW HARD IT IS

15:08.575 --> 15:10.477
FOR ME TO BE
AROUND THAT PLACE.

15:10.543 --> 15:13.346
- I SHOULD? WHY?
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE IN THERAPY.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.683
YOU UNDERSTAND THE HUM
CONDITION, AT LEAST.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.687
STILL DOING THAT?

15:20.754 --> 15:23.056
TURN THOSE RIBS.

15:23.123 --> 15:25.825
TRUTH IS,
BETWEEN THE BOOZE
AND THE STRIPPERS OVER THERE,

15:25.925 --> 15:27.827
HALF OF THEM
ARE FUCKING COKEHEADS.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.863
IT'S HARD, YOU KNOW?

15:29.929 --> 15:32.832
AND SATRIALE'S,
THAT FRIDGE FULL OF BEER.

15:32.899 --> 15:34.768
YOU KNOW HOW TOUGH
IT IS TO EAT A SAUSAGE
AND PEPPERS

15:34.901 --> 15:36.102
WITHOUT A COLD ONE?

15:36.169 --> 15:38.605
SO THEN JUST QUIT.
YOU WANT A BEER,
TOO BAD.

15:38.738 --> 15:40.674
- SHOW SOME BALLS.
- I GOT BALLS.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.776
I N'T EAT EGGPLANT
NO MORE 'CAUSE
OF MY STOMACH.

15:42.909 --> 15:44.844
MIGHT PUT ME
INTO A RELAPSE.

15:44.911 --> 15:47.614
NOW BELIEVE ME,
I'D LIKE TO, BUT I DON'T.

15:47.681 --> 15:49.916
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.152
- WELL, MAKE IT SIMPLE.
- IT'S A DISEASE.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.888
I INHERITED IT.
YOU KNOW THE PROBLEM
WITH MY MOTHER.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.393
I GOTTA BE HONEST.
THIS WHOLE DISEASE CONCEPT,

16:00.460 --> 16:02.095
I THINK IT'S BULLSHIT.

16:02.228 --> 16:04.297
SO YOU KNOW MORE THAN
THE LEADING SCIENTISTS NOW?

16:04.397 --> 16:06.866
- I KNOW A CRUTCH
WHEN I SEE IT.
- SO MY DAD?

16:06.933 --> 16:09.235
YOU OBVIOUSLY MUST HAVE
KNEW HE HAD A CRUTCH.

16:09.269 --> 16:13.239
- WHAT THE FUCK ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- COME ON, TON', HUH?

16:13.273 --> 16:15.141
BETWEEN THE COKE,
THE VODKA,

16:15.275 --> 16:17.610
WHATEVER THE FUCK ELSE
HE WAS SQUIRTING
UP HIS ARM--

16:17.711 --> 16:20.380
LET'S BE HONEST
ABOUT THE GREAT
DICKIE MOLTISANTI:

16:20.447 --> 16:23.483
MY DAD, YOUR HERO,

16:23.583 --> 16:25.585
WASN'T MUCH MORE
THAN A FUCKING JUNKIE.

16:40.767 --> 16:44.304
- HEY, DON'T FUCKING MOVE!
- WHOA, WHOA, AL, WHOA, WH.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.906
- EASY EASY.
- WHAT THE FUCK
IS GOING ON?

16:47.007 --> 16:49.576
PAULIE, REMEMBER?
GERMANI.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.578
WE MET AT YOUR
GRANDDAUGHTER'S
CHRISTENING.

16:51.644 --> 16:53.146
THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING?

16:53.246 --> 16:55.415
- MY UNCLE DIDN'T CALL YOU?
- NO... ( cocks gun )

16:55.548 --> 16:58.118
- WHO'S YOUR UNCLE?
- PAULIE GAULTIERI.

16:58.251 --> 17:01.488
- THESE ARE FOR HIS FRIEND
DOWN AT THE UNION.
- WHAT UNION?

17:01.588 --> 17:04.357
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO CALL YOU.
YOU FUCKING BELIEVE THIS?

17:09.829 --> 17:12.365
AL, THIS IS A BIG
FUCKING MIX-UP.

17:12.464 --> 17:14.467
I THOUGHT PAULIE
CALLED YOU.

17:14.601 --> 17:16.836
- THE GUY'S WAITING.
- SO YOU BREAK IN?

17:16.970 --> 17:18.972
I GOT A SILENT ALARM
THAT GOES RIGHT
TO MY HOUSE.

17:19.138 --> 17:20.240
HE'LL TAKE CARE
OF YOU. DON'T WORRY.

17:20.306 --> 17:22.208
LET ME TALK
TO MY SON-IN-LAW.

17:22.308 --> 17:24.377
CHRIS? FINE BY ME,

17:24.477 --> 17:28.214
BUT IF I WERE YOU,
I WOULDN'T MAKE A PROBLEM
WHERE THERE AIN'T ONE.

17:32.619 --> 17:36.322
<i>( love song</i>
<i>playing on radio )</i>

17:40.060 --> 17:43.196
( laughing )

17:49.803 --> 17:52.205
- ( crying ) TAKE OVER,
OKAY, FELIX?
- WHAT YOU DO?

17:52.305 --> 17:54.040
- I'M LEAVING.
- WHO?

17:54.140 --> 17:56.309
I'M GOING HOME,
ALL RIGHT? I QUIT.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.311
WHY YOU DO THAT?

17:58.378 --> 18:00.480
IF DALE CALLS,
JUST TELL HIM I'M SORRY.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.349
BUT YOU'RE THE MANAGER.

18:04.818 --> 18:08.154
- TON', HEY.
- HEY.

18:08.321 --> 18:11.224
- HOW YOU DOING?
- THIS ALWAYS HELPS.

18:11.324 --> 18:14.794
OOH!
GOD BLESS THE NFL.

18:14.928 --> 18:17.997
I TELL YA,
I OWE A SPOT
OF IT TO MY SON.

18:18.164 --> 18:21.234
I WAS AGAINST THIS KID
EVEN GOING TO COLLEGE.

18:21.334 --> 18:24.337
BUT ONCE HIM AND CARLO'S
KID STARTED TAKING ACTION
ON CAMPUS,

18:24.404 --> 18:27.674
FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
HE SHOULD STAY TILL
HE GETS A PhD.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.609
BENEFITS OF A HIGHER
EDUCATION.

18:29.676 --> 18:32.178
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
HE'S LEARNING STUFF, TOO.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.581
THE SHIT THIS KID KNOWS
ABOUT COMPUTERS--

18:34.714 --> 18:36.583
HE SET HIS MOTHER UP
WITH A WHOLE WEB SITE

18:36.683 --> 18:38.018
FOR HER
CERAMICS BUSINESS.

18:38.118 --> 18:40.086
YOU MUST BE
VERY PROUD.

18:40.120 --> 18:43.523
BELIEVE ME,
I THANK GOD
EVERY DAY.

18:44.958 --> 18:47.360
I GOTTA TAKE A LEAK.

18:56.036 --> 18:59.906
PARISI THE YOUNGER.
I WAS JUST TALKING
TO YOUR DAD ABOUT YOU.

18:59.939 --> 19:03.376
- WHAT DID I DO NOW?
- TO HEAR HIM TELL IT,
U'RE THE GOLDEN BOY.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.415
- HEY, TON'.
- WHAT THE FUCK'S WITH YOU?

19:08.481 --> 19:11.484
ROOT CANAL.

19:20.260 --> 19:23.430

19:36.309 --> 19:38.945
THINGS CHANGE,UH?

19:39.079 --> 19:41.915
WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE,
IT WASN'T SO MUCH
WITH THE SPORTS BETTING.

19:41.948 --> 19:44.451
- HEY, HOW'S AJ DOING?
- GOOD GOOD.

19:44.617 --> 19:47.454

19:52.058 --> 19:53.993
YEAH YEAH,

19:54.127 --> 19:55.862
HE DIDN'T WANT

20:41.474 --> 20:43.476

20:58.992 --> 21:00.660
IT COULDN'T WAIT, OKAY?
I PRED A LOAD

21:00.827 --> 21:02.362

21:02.495 --> 21:04.164
WHAT DO I GIVE A FUCK?
IT AIN'T MY UNION.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.699
LOWER YOUR VOICE.
I GOT NEIGHBORS.

21:31.958 --> 21:36.196
HE SENT HIS IDIOT NEPHEW
AND JASON MOLINARO TO MY
FATHER-IN-LAW'S STORE.

21:36.262 --> 21:38.098
THEY BOOSTED A PALLET
OF POWER SAWS.

21:38.198 --> 21:40.100
- THEY DID?
- YEAH.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.435
NOT EXACTLY.
AL CAUGHT 'EM
WHILE THEY WERE THERE.

21:42.569 --> 21:45.071
SO THEY DID OR THEY
DID NOT TAKE THE SAWS?

21:45.205 --> 21:48.475
THEY DID
UNDER FALSE PRETENSE.

21:48.575 --> 21:50.243
AND THIS IS WHAT

POTENTIALLY MULTIMILLION-
DOLLAR PROPOSITION HERE,

22:00.620 --> 22:01.988
IT AIN'T THE MONEY,
TON'.

22:02.122 --> 22:05.392
OH, REALLY?
WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU FEEL THAT WAY.

22:05.525 --> 22:08.728
A PALLET OF DRILLS.

I GOT OTHER SHIT TO DO.

22:19.339 --> 22:22.809

<i>- COME IN.</i>

22:22.909 --> 22:25.378
I NEED TO TALK

22:25.445 --> 22:28.181
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
FINN?

22:28.281 --> 22:30.750
WHAT? NO.

22:30.817 --> 22:33.119
IT'S NOT ABOUT ME.
AJ.

22:33.186 --> 22:36.456
- WHAT ABOUT HIM?
- I KNOW HE'S UPSET,

22:36.523 --> 22:39.826
BUT HE'S BEEN SAYING
SOME THINGS THAT ARE
REALLY DISTURBING.

22:39.926 --> 22:43.163
- LIKE WHAT?
- LIKE NOBODY GIVES
A SHIT ABOUT HIM.

22:43.296 --> 22:46.700
WHAT'S THE POINT
OF ANYTHING? STUFF LIKE THAT.

22:46.800 --> 22:50.036
I TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT GIRL
HADLEY IN MY DORM
SOPHOMORE YEAR,

22:50.103 --> 22:53.373
THE ONE WHO
THREW HERSELF OFF
THE LIBRARY BALCONY.

22:53.473 --> 22:55.942
THESE ARE THE EXACT
KIND OF THINGS SHE
WAS SAYING.

22:57.977 --> 23:00.480
I DON'T MEAN
TO GET YOU ALL UPSET--

23:00.547 --> 23:03.016
OF COURSE NOT.
I'M GLAD YOU SAID
SOMETHING.

23:03.116 --> 23:05.685
GOOD NIGHT.

23:05.719 --> 23:08.722
- Carmela: <i>GOOD NIGHT,</i>
<i>SWEETIE.</i>
<i>-</i> <i>GET SOME SLEEP.</i>

23:19.733 --> 23:21.968
<i>( man speaking on TV )</i>

23:23.737 --> 23:26.106
Man:
<i>I'm just a guy looking</i>
<i>to punch you in the mouth.</i>

23:26.139 --> 23:28.708
Oh, you can
take a punch.

23:28.808 --> 23:30.310
<i>I guess we knew that</i>
<i>already, didt we?</i>

23:33.847 --> 23:36.483
You can actually land
a punch, too.

23:42.655 --> 23:44.657
- <i>You're pretty good...</i>
<i>-</i> <i>Thanks.</i>

23:44.724 --> 23:46.659
<i>...against a 36-year-old</i>
<i>out-of-shape lieutenant.</i>

23:46.726 --> 23:49.095
<i>( fighting continues )</i>

24:05.211 --> 24:07.847
I CAME HERE TODAY
TO TELL YOU

24:07.914 --> 24:10.517
IN ALL SERIOUSNESS
THAT I'M DONE.

24:11.918 --> 24:14.054
I DID WHAT YOU SAID.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.089
I GAVE IT A LOT
OF THOUGHT,

24:16.222 --> 24:18.925
AND I DECIDED THAT
ONCE AND FOR ALL,

24:19.059 --> 24:21.428
IT'S OVER.

24:23.563 --> 24:24.964
THE TRUTH IS

24:25.065 --> 24:28.234
THIS THERAPY IS A JERK-OFF.

24:28.301 --> 24:30.470
YOU KNOW IT,
AND I KNOW IT.

24:30.603 --> 24:33.406
I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW IT,

24:33.473 --> 24:36.242
BUT PLEASE CONTINUE.

24:36.309 --> 24:39.112
- IT'S A JERK-OFF.
- YES, YOU'VE SAID THAT.

24:43.616 --> 24:45.185
ANYWAY, I WAS COMING HERE
TO QUIT.

24:45.285 --> 24:49.055
HAD IT ALL PLANNED OUT.
BUT GUESS WHAT.

24:51.658 --> 24:54.427
MY SON IS
LKING SUICIDE.

24:54.494 --> 24:56.429
SO NOW I'M TRAPPED
HERE FOREVER.

24:56.496 --> 24:58.631
MY GOD,
WHAT DID HE SAY?

24:58.665 --> 25:01.167
HIS GIRLFRIEND,
FIANCEE, WHATEVER--

25:01.234 --> 25:02.802
<i>SHE BROKE UP WITH HIM.</i>

25:02.836 --> 25:05.105
HE'S BEYOND DEVASTATED.

25:05.238 --> 25:08.008
WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO RECOMMEND SOMEONE
FOR HIM TO TALK TO?

25:08.074 --> 25:11.711
CARMELA'S GETTING
A REFERRAL FROM HIS
OWN PEDIATRICIAN.

25:11.778 --> 25:14.681
- OH.
- AFTETHAT INCOMPETENT
YOU SENT MEADOW TO?

25:22.255 --> 25:25.525
SO I SUPPOSE NOW
COMES THE INHERENT
FUCKING GRILLING

25:25.592 --> 25:29.362
- ABOUT HOW I FEEL
ABOUT ALL THIS.
- ISN'T THAT WHY YOU'RE HERE?

25:29.429 --> 25:32.432
( sighs )

25:32.599 --> 25:35.769
FRIENDS OF MINE,
THEY GOT SONS HIS AGE,

25:35.869 --> 25:39.305
AND THEY'RE HAPPY,

25:39.372 --> 25:42.308
AMBITIOUS.

25:42.442 --> 25:44.411
THEY FUCKING TAKE LIFE
AS IT COMES.

25:44.444 --> 25:46.946
I KNOW IT SEEMS
THAT WAY,

25:47.047 --> 25:50.116
BUT DO YOU REALLY KNOW
THESE OTHER BOYS?

25:50.116 --> 25:53.053
I KNOW WHAT I SEE,
MY SON CURLED UP
ON THE COUCH

25:53.153 --> 25:55.889
IN A FETUS POSITION
WHEN HE SHOULD BE OUT
BANGING COEDS.

25:55.955 --> 25:58.892
- HAVE YOU TALKED TO HIM?
- TILL I'M BLUE IN THE FACE.

25:58.958 --> 26:01.294
WE BOTH HAVE,
AND NOW WE'RE AFRAID
TO TALK TO HIM

26:01.361 --> 26:05.131
BECAUSE OF WHAT
HE MIGHT DO.

26:08.802 --> 26:12.339
OBVIOUSLY,
I'M PRONE TO DEPRESSION--

26:12.405 --> 26:15.208
A CERTAIN BLEAK ATTITUDE

26:15.308 --> 26:17.510
ABOUT THE WORLD,

26:17.577 --> 26:20.680
BUT I KNOW
I CAN HANDLE IT.

26:20.747 --> 26:22.816
YOUR KIDS, THOUGH--

26:27.821 --> 26:29.723
IT'S LIKE
WHEN THEY'RE LITTLE,

26:29.823 --> 26:32.425
AND THEY GET SICK,

26:35.395 --> 26:38.231
YOU'D GIVE ANYTHING
IN THE WORLD TO TRADE
PLACES WITH THEM,

26:38.331 --> 26:40.500
SO THEY DON'T
HAVE TO SUFFER.

26:42.736 --> 26:44.738
AND THEN TO THINK
YOU'RE THE CAUSE OF IT.

26:44.771 --> 26:46.673
HOW ARE YOU
THE CAUSE OF IT?

26:46.773 --> 26:50.710
IT'S IN HIS BLOOD,
THIS MISERABLE FUCKING
EXISTENCE.

26:52.112 --> 26:54.681
MY ROTTEN FUCKING
PUTRID GENES

26:54.781 --> 26:57.183
HAVE INFECTED
KID'S SOUL.

26:57.350 --> 26:59.352
THAT'S MY GIFT
TO MY SON.

27:12.132 --> 27:15.035
I KNOW THIS
IS DIFFICULT.

27:16.870 --> 27:20.106
BUT I'M VERY GLAD
WE'RE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION.

27:20.140 --> 27:22.208
REALLY, REALLY?

27:22.275 --> 27:24.544
'CAUSE I GOTTA BE HONEST.
I THINK IT FUCKING SUCKS.

27:24.644 --> 27:27.113
- WHAT DOES?
- THERAPY, THIS.

27:27.213 --> 27:29.115
I HATE THIS FUCKING SHIT!

27:32.285 --> 27:35.889
SERIOUSLY, WE'RE BOTH
ADULTS HERE, RIGHT?

27:37.223 --> 27:39.959
SO AFTER ALL IS SAID

27:40.060 --> 27:41.394
AND DONE,

27:41.494 --> 27:43.430
AFTER ALL THE COMPLAINING
AND THE CRYING

27:43.496 --> 27:46.633
AND ALL THE
FUCKING BULLSHIT,

27:46.733 --> 27:50.236
IS THIS ALL THERE IS?

27:54.240 --> 27:56.476
YES, WELCOME.

27:56.509 --> 27:59.145
HI, I'M CHRIS.
I'M AN ALCOHOLIC
AND DRUG ADDICT.

27:59.245 --> 28:00.714
All: HI, CHRIS.

28:00.747 --> 28:03.249
I WANT TO GO BACK
TO WHAT STAN SAID--

28:03.416 --> 28:05.251
<i>HOW NOT BEING ABLE</i>
<i>TO SOCIALIZE</i>

28:05.352 --> 28:07.654
IS HARD
WHEN YOU'RE A SALESMAN.

28:07.754 --> 28:09.689
IN MY CASE,
IT'S THE SAME THING.

28:09.756 --> 28:12.692
IT'S ACTUALLY TAKING FOOD
OUT OF MY DAUGHTER MOUTH.

28:12.826 --> 28:16.363
MY BOSS,
FOR ALL HIS BULLSHIT
ENCOURAGEMENT,

28:16.429 --> 28:18.365
HOW HE RESPECTS
WHAT I'M DOING,

28:18.431 --> 28:21.034
THE REALITY IS
HE RESENTS MY SOBRIETY.

28:21.101 --> 28:22.769
I HAD THE SAME THING
AT UNICOR.

28:22.869 --> 28:24.771
THEY WERE ALL ONBOARD
FOR THE INTERVENTION,

28:24.938 --> 28:27.974
BUT SKIP ONE GOLF OUTING,
AND YOU'RE OSTRACIZED.

28:28.041 --> 28:30.710
HE'S AN ENABLER, TOO,
THIS GUY, THE WORST
FUCKING KIND.

28:30.844 --> 28:32.779
POURS YOU A DRINK
WITH ONE HAND,

28:32.846 --> 28:35.048
JUDGES YOU WITH THE OTHER
IF YOU TAKE IT.

28:35.148 --> 28:37.117
AND HE WONDERS
WHY I'M DISTANT--
AT LEAST HE SAYS HE DOES--

28:37.217 --> 28:39.419
WHY I WANNA BRANCH OUT
INTO OTHER THINGS.

28:39.486 --> 28:41.921
BUT I CAN PROMISE YOU
I'D HAVE MORE MONEY
IN MY POCKET,

28:42.022 --> 28:45.191
PLUS MORE RESPONSIBILITY
IF I SAT WITH HIM DRINKING,

28:45.291 --> 28:47.227
WATCHING THAT SCOTCH
DROOL OUT

28:47.327 --> 28:50.030
OF HIS FAT
FUCKING MOUTH.

28:50.163 --> 28:52.032
<i>( rock music playing )</i>

28:52.165 --> 28:54.034
<i>( lion growling )</i>

28:54.167 --> 28:55.835
<i>( men laughing )</i>

28:55.969 --> 28:57.804
Man:
<i>...embedded that dream</i>
<i>into our culture...</i>

28:57.837 --> 28:59.973
<i>( folk music</i>
<i>playing )</i>

29:00.040 --> 29:02.175
HEY.

29:07.380 --> 29:08.882
<i>( traffic sounds )</i>

29:09.015 --> 29:10.183
<i>( big band plays )</i>

29:10.250 --> 29:11.518
WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING?

29:11.584 --> 29:13.586
NOTHING.

29:14.854 --> 29:16.556
OH, WHOA,
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

29:16.656 --> 29:17.691
JOHN WAYNE.

29:26.199 --> 29:28.601
TWO JASONS CALL YOU?

29:28.702 --> 29:30.570
INVITE YOU TO A PARTY
TOMORROW NIGHT?

29:31.671 --> 29:33.039
I DON'T KNOW.

29:33.106 --> 29:35.241
WELL, EITHER THEY DID
OR THEY DIDN'T.

29:35.375 --> 29:38.745
YEAH, I GUESS.
JASON GERVASI CALLED.

29:40.046 --> 29:42.182
WHAT'D YOU TELL HIM?

29:42.248 --> 29:43.783
I DIDN'T
CALL HIM BACK.

29:43.850 --> 29:45.185
HOW COME?

29:45.251 --> 29:47.554
'CAUSE I DON'T
WANT TO GO.

29:47.620 --> 29:49.589
( sighs )

29:49.723 --> 29:52.425
OF COURSE NOT.
BEER, STRIPPERS,

29:52.559 --> 29:55.128
FUCKIN' AROUND WITH GUYS
YOUR OWN AGE--

29:55.228 --> 29:57.364
YOU HATE ALL THAT SHIT.

29:59.966 --> 30:01.401
YOU GONNA CALL HIM?

30:01.534 --> 30:03.136
SAID I DON'T
WANT TO GO.

30:05.038 --> 30:07.741
I KNOW YOU DON'T
WANT TO GO.

30:07.807 --> 30:10.210
YOU DON'T WANT TO WORK,
YOU DON'T WANT TO EAT,

30:10.310 --> 30:11.945
YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK.

30:12.045 --> 30:13.546
SO, ALL THAT
BEING THE CASE,

30:13.613 --> 30:15.548
YOU'RE GONNA SHOWER TOMORROW
NIGHT, YOU'RE GONNA SHAVE,

30:15.715 --> 30:18.551
YOU'RE GONNA GET DRESS,
YOU'RE GONNA GO TO THAT PARTY.

30:22.489 --> 30:24.591
I'M NOT GONNA
DEBATE YOU ON THIS.

30:31.097 --> 30:32.399
FINE.

30:37.504 --> 30:40.807
...just how soon
before they attempt to
blow this fire out?

30:40.940 --> 30:43.510
<i>They won't try to</i>
<i>kill it till they're ready</i>
<i>to cap the well.</i>

30:43.643 --> 30:47.247
- YOUR BOSS IS YOUR UNCLE.
- ONCE REMOVED.

30:49.082 --> 30:50.850
THAT'S GOTTA ADD
TO THE SOURCE.

30:53.353 --> 30:55.321
WE USED TO BE SO TIGHT.

30:55.422 --> 30:58.925
AND PRODUCING MOVIES
IS HIGH-STRESS ENOUGH.

31:00.927 --> 31:03.596
I HAVE A HAPPY MARRIAGE.

31:04.864 --> 31:07.467
BUT THERE WAS A WOMAN...

31:08.968 --> 31:13.707
SHE WORKED WITH US
IN A CLUB WE HAD.

31:13.807 --> 31:17.444
ANYWAY, SHE BECAME
A PROBLEM TO DEAL WITH,

31:17.510 --> 31:20.613
AND...

31:20.680 --> 31:22.816
I SIDED WITH HIM.

31:22.882 --> 31:24.884
SHE WAS OUT
OF MY LIFE.

31:26.953 --> 31:30.557
OKAY, FINE.

31:30.690 --> 31:33.927
BUT HE NEVER
APPRECIATED IT.

31:33.993 --> 31:37.697
GIVE GIVE GIVE,
IT'S ALL I EVER DO.

31:40.300 --> 31:42.168
I THINK THAT'S WHEN
THE RELATIONSHIP

31:42.235 --> 31:44.037
BETWEEN ME AND HIM
GOT POISONED.

31:57.350 --> 31:58.718
( door beeps )

32:04.357 --> 32:06.059
HOW'S IT GOING?

32:06.159 --> 32:07.527
AL HERE?

32:07.660 --> 32:09.362
YOU JUST MISSED HIM.
HE WENT TO LUNCH.

32:09.496 --> 32:10.897
- EH.
- CAN I HELP YOU FELLAS?

32:11.031 --> 32:12.365
WE'RE HERE
FOR THE DRILLS.

32:12.432 --> 32:13.900
WHAT DRILLS?

32:14.034 --> 32:15.435
YOU KNOW,
THE BACK.

32:20.206 --> 32:23.443
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN,
BUT AL DIDN'T SAY NOTHING
ABOUT PICKING ANYTHING UP.

32:23.543 --> 32:25.011
THIS FUCKIN' GUY.

32:25.078 --> 32:26.680
GET HIM ON THE PHONE.

32:26.780 --> 32:27.914
ALL RIGHT.

32:28.014 --> 32:29.249
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

32:29.382 --> 32:31.217
ME? I'M MIKE.

32:31.284 --> 32:32.452
- ( beeping )
- PAULIE.

32:32.585 --> 32:34.621
NICE TO MEET.

32:34.721 --> 32:35.955
VOICE MAIL.

32:36.089 --> 32:37.724
GIMME THAT.

32:37.857 --> 32:39.893
YEAH, AL,
IT'S PAULIE.

32:40.026 --> 32:41.795
LISTEN, WE'RE HERE
WITH MIKE.

32:41.861 --> 32:45.265
WE'RE GONNA TAKE THE DRILLS.
I'LL CALL YOU LATER ABOUT
THAT OTHER ORDER.

32:46.433 --> 32:48.201
HUH?

32:49.436 --> 32:51.805
LET'S GO.

33:02.882 --> 33:04.417
WHAT'S HER NAME?

33:06.820 --> 33:07.921
BLANCA.

33:07.987 --> 33:11.257
HAD YOU AND BLANCA
BEEN ENGAGED LONG?

33:12.759 --> 33:15.261
ONLY A COUPLE
OF WEEKS.

33:15.395 --> 33:17.263
SHE HAD A SON TOO,

33:17.330 --> 33:19.132
FROM WHEN SHE USED
TO BE MARRIED.

33:19.165 --> 33:20.934
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WENT WRONG?

33:20.967 --> 33:24.404
HER HUSBAND WAS
AN ASSHOLE, SUPPOSEDLY.

33:24.437 --> 33:25.972
WITH YOUR RELATIONSHIP?

33:26.106 --> 33:27.674
OH.

33:29.109 --> 33:31.011
I DON'T KNOW.

33:31.111 --> 33:33.113
I MEAN, I WISH THERE
WAS A REASON, BUT...

33:33.179 --> 33:34.748
SHE SAYS THERE ISN'T.

33:39.352 --> 33:41.821
I THINK MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
WE HAVE WAY MORE MONEY

33:41.988 --> 33:43.456
IN MY FAMILY THAN HERS.

33:43.590 --> 33:45.191
<i>THEY'RE IMMIGRANTS,</i>

33:45.291 --> 33:47.093
AND THAT MIGHT
HAVE SCARED HER.

33:55.769 --> 33:58.471
HAVE YOU BEEN FEELING
SUICIDAL, ANTHONY?

34:04.444 --> 34:05.779
A LITTLE B.

34:05.945 --> 34:08.181
HAVE YOU EVER TRIED
TO KILL YOURSELF?

34:08.281 --> 34:11.284
NO.

34:11.384 --> 34:14.187
I MEAN, ONCE,
ME AND MY FRIENDS

34:14.286 --> 34:15.955
JUMPED OFF MY
GARAGE ROOF,

34:16.022 --> 34:18.558
BUT YOU KNOW, THAT WAS
JUST TO FOOL AROUND.

34:26.733 --> 34:28.967
YOU SLEEPING A LOT?

34:30.804 --> 34:32.371
I'M TIRED,

34:32.472 --> 34:33.973
BUT I KEEP WAKING UP.

34:34.074 --> 34:35.375
NIGHTMARES?

34:35.442 --> 34:38.812
I JUST KEEP THINKING
ABOUT HER.

34:39.913 --> 34:42.014
I MEAN,
IT HURTS, BUT...

34:42.148 --> 34:43.550
I CAN'T HELP IT.

34:43.616 --> 34:46.186
DOES ANYTHING IN LIFE
GIVE YOU PLEASURE LATELY?

34:47.954 --> 34:49.723
I DON'T KNOW.

34:49.789 --> 34:51.056
NOT REALLY.

34:51.123 --> 34:54.194
THERE'S A MEDICATION
CALLED LEXAPRO.

34:54.360 --> 34:55.628
IT'S AN ANTIDEPRESSANT.

34:55.762 --> 34:57.364
I HAVE FRIENDS
WHO TAKE THAT.

34:57.364 --> 35:00.033
WELL, I'M GOING TO
WRITE YOU A PRESCRIPTION.

35:00.133 --> 35:02.535
<i>( rock music playing )</i>

35:02.602 --> 35:05.305
I'M MAKING MAD
FUCKIN' MONEY, BRO.

35:05.372 --> 35:07.540
I GOTTA SHUT
MY PHONE OFF SOMETIMES.

35:07.607 --> 35:09.309
YOU SHOULD TOTALLY
DO IT, MAN.

35:09.376 --> 35:12.412
I'M NOT REALLY
GOOD WITH BETTING
AND PERCENTAGES.

35:12.512 --> 35:14.681
I GOT LIKE A 450
ON MY MATH SAT.

35:14.781 --> 35:17.684
FUCK THAT SHIT, BRO.
I COULD HOOK YOU UP IN
LIKE 10 MINUTES.

35:20.520 --> 35:22.689
CAN I DANCE
FOR YOU, BABY?

35:22.756 --> 35:24.858
I GUESS.

35:27.627 --> 35:29.195
<i>( Gervasi laughing )</i>

35:29.295 --> 35:31.731
YEAH, DUDE!

YEAH!

35:48.281 --> 35:49.883
LOOK AT THIS PILE
OF SHIT.

35:49.916 --> 35:51.951
YEAH, SO GET SOME
TOILET PAPER.

35:52.052 --> 35:53.586
WHAT IS THAT,
COMEDY?

35:53.653 --> 35:54.888
- <i>( buzzer sounds )</i>
<i>- ACTUALLY, YEAH.</i>

35:54.921 --> 35:56.423
COME ON,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

35:56.489 --> 35:59.292
FUCK IT,
I'M ALL IN.

35:59.426 --> 36:00.927
FUCKIN' IDIOT.
TOILET PAPER?

36:01.061 --> 36:02.429
FUCKIN' CUNT!

36:02.495 --> 36:04.464
- FUCK!
- HO, CHRIS!

36:04.597 --> 36:06.566
YOU WERE MY FRIEND.

36:10.437 --> 36:12.238
WHOA! NO!

36:17.410 --> 36:19.512
OH, FUCK!

36:19.646 --> 36:21.748
CALL AN AMBULANCE!

36:21.848 --> 36:23.650
( moans )

36:28.421 --> 36:30.857
, WAKE UP.
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

36:33.860 --> 36:35.195
WHAT?

36:35.295 --> 36:39.599
YOU LET OUR UNDERAGE
SON GO TO A PARTY AT
A STRIP CLUB?

36:41.601 --> 36:43.603
WHAT TIME IS IT?

36:50.443 --> 36:52.779
TAKE IT EASY, WILL YOU?
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

36:52.846 --> 36:54.481
HE JUST GOT IN
THREE HOURS AGO.

36:54.614 --> 36:58.251
HE IS STILL DRUNK AND
HE'S NOT EVEN DRINKING AGE!

36:58.385 --> 36:59.786
YET HE COULD DIE
IN IRAQ.

36:59.853 --> 37:01.688
WHAT DOES THAT
HA TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

37:01.788 --> 37:05.125
JESUS CHRIST, CARM,
HE'S GONNA BE 21 IN
TWO MONTHS.

37:05.225 --> 37:07.360
HE'S AN EMOTIONAL
WRECK, TONY.

37:07.394 --> 37:10.897
SO, SEEING AAIR
OF TITS IS GONNA SEND
HIM OVER THE EDGE?

37:11.031 --> 37:13.333
GOT HIM OUT OF THE HOUSE,
AROUND PEOPLE HIS OWN AGE.

37:13.400 --> 37:14.801
AT THE FUCKIN' BING?

37:14.868 --> 37:17.070
WELL, THEY'RE COLLEGE KIDS.
IT'S WHAT THEY DO.

37:17.170 --> 37:19.839
I KNOW YOU'D RATHER SEE HIM
IN HIS ROOM DRINKIN' COCOA,

37:19.973 --> 37:22.609
BUT THIS IS
THE WAY BACK,

37:22.676 --> 37:25.211
BELIEVE ME-- AND THE
WAY BACK TO COLLEGE--

37:27.213 --> 37:29.849
FRATERNITIES,
FR BOYS.

37:39.592 --> 37:40.694
<i>HEY.</i>

37:48.335 --> 37:50.603
I DID A STUPID THING, TON'.
I WON'T DENY IT.

37:50.704 --> 37:52.405
STUPID? JUST
HUNG UP WITH PAULIE.

37:52.539 --> 37:54.874
HIS NEPHEW'S GOT
SIX BROKEN VERTEBRAES.

37:54.941 --> 37:56.943
( tires screeching )

38:02.015 --> 38:03.950
I KNOW THAT,
AND I'M SORRY.

38:04.017 --> 38:06.419
BUT THIS IS THE SECOND
FUCKIN' TIME

38:06.519 --> 38:09.022
PAULIE FLOUTED HIS
AUTHORITY TO MY FACE.

38:09.122 --> 38:12.892
<i>THIS SHITH THE TOOLS--</i>
<i>I KNOW HE SET UP THE DEAL</i>
<i>WITH THE CUBANS,</i>

38:12.959 --> 38:16.162
BUT THIS IS MY FATHER-IN-LAW
WE'RE TALKIN' ABOUT, TONY,
MY FAMILY.

38:16.196 --> 38:19.232
IN ANY CASE, THIS BULLSHIT
COULD HAVE BEEN HANDLED
WITH A CONVERSATION.

38:31.911 --> 38:34.914
I CAME TO THE BING, REMEMBER?
I TRIED TO TALK TO
YOU ABOUT IT.

38:34.948 --> 38:36.349
AND I TOLD YOU TO WAIT,
AND YOU LEFT

38:36.416 --> 38:38.551
TO GO GOD-KNOWS-WHERE.

38:38.651 --> 38:40.854
OH, I GOT TO BE HONEST,
