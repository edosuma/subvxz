WEBVTT

01:02.830 --> 01:04.798
Hello, everybody.

01:04.865 --> 01:06.834
How are you

01:06.900 --> 01:09.537
Thank you. Good to see you.
Thank you for coming.

01:15.643 --> 01:17.778
Cold out there!

01:17.845 --> 01:19.213
That is cold.

01:20.214 --> 01:22.283
Hello, everybody!

01:23.784 --> 01:25.386
Hello!

01:25.453 --> 01:30.057
Hello. Welcome to The Grand
Tour. Happy Christmas.

01:30.158 --> 01:31.692
This week, we are coming -

01:31.759 --> 01:35.229
if you can see through
the drizzle dribbling down
the windows -

01:35.296 --> 01:36.664
from Scandinavia.

01:39.533 --> 01:40.868
Oh, yeah.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.236
This, of course...

01:42.303 --> 01:45.639
This, of course, is the home
of those gloomy dramas

01:45.706 --> 01:48.642
where a weird woman
in a jumper solves a murder

01:48.709 --> 01:51.579
by staring at a lake
for six hours.

01:52.846 --> 01:54.848
This will probably be
the jolliest programme

01:54.915 --> 01:57.218
to come out of this
neck of the woods since...

01:57.285 --> 01:58.619
... Four Funerals
And A Funeral .

01:58.686 --> 02:00.020
JEREMY: Yeah.

02:00.188 --> 02:02.423
Swedish rom-com that was.
Erm...

02:02.490 --> 02:04.325
When Harry Shot Sally .

02:04.392 --> 02:05.693
Oh, a laugh a minute.

02:05.759 --> 02:08.196
The Girl With
The Pearl Necklace. No.

02:09.697 --> 02:12.800
-That's another sort of
Scandinavian film.

02:12.866 --> 02:14.268
Yeah.

02:17.037 --> 02:18.306
Anyway, specifically,

02:18.372 --> 02:22.075
we are deep inside
the Arctic Circle in Finland.

02:24.312 --> 02:27.481
There you go.
And Finland, of course...

02:27.548 --> 02:33.354
Finland, of course, is home
to every single racing driver
currently...

02:36.324 --> 02:39.092
Well, apart from
Nico Rosberg, who is Finnish,

02:39.227 --> 02:41.529
but, for some reason,
claims he's German.

02:43.664 --> 02:46.234
Why does he do that?
I have no idea.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.468
Who else is there, then?

02:47.535 --> 02:48.736
Well, there's Mika Salo,

02:48.802 --> 02:50.538
Mika Häkkinen,
Kimi Räikkönen.

02:50.604 --> 02:53.274
Hang on, they're just
anagrams of the same name,
aren't they?

02:53.341 --> 02:55.276
-Then you've got rallying.

02:55.343 --> 02:57.611
There's Tommi Mäkinen,
Timo Mäkinen,

02:57.678 --> 03:00.080
Juha Kankkunen, Ari Vatanen.

03:00.248 --> 03:01.649
More anagrams.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.618
Kinky Wankinen.

03:07.288 --> 03:08.956
Manky Pantiden.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.591
Really?

03:10.658 --> 03:12.760
I'm getting
slightly carried away now.

03:12.826 --> 03:15.028
Seriously, I went on
Wikipedia last night

03:15.095 --> 03:18.266
to look for famous Finns
who aren't racing drivers.

03:18.299 --> 03:19.600
Put up the list I found.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.336
And I noticed something -
they're all men.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.372
-All of them.

03:24.438 --> 03:26.674
Are there any famous
Finnish women?

03:30.478 --> 03:33.314
Nobody thinks so.
They're all...

03:33.381 --> 03:34.648
I know why, OK?

03:34.715 --> 03:38.352
It's because all Finnish
women, at the age of 19,

03:38.419 --> 03:40.020
move to England
to be au pairs.

03:41.822 --> 03:44.658
I actually had three Finnish
au pairs over the years
for my children.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.427
-Yeah. It was always funny.

03:46.494 --> 03:49.096
You'd go to Heathrow airport
to pick up your new au pair,

03:49.162 --> 03:53.200
and there'd always be a row
of 30-something fathers
waiting at the gate

03:53.301 --> 03:56.337
for their Scandinavian
au pair to come out.

03:57.771 --> 03:59.807
And there was one year
I've never forgotten.

03:59.873 --> 04:03.511
This huge moose
lumbered out of the door,

04:03.577 --> 04:08.048
and the man next to me looked
at his piece of paper and
went, "Oh, for God's sake!"

04:11.151 --> 04:12.353
That's not good.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.959
-Shall we get on with
the show?
-Yes, good idea.

04:19.026 --> 04:23.464
Because tonight
in our television
programme about cars...

04:23.531 --> 04:25.433
I eat some cheddar.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.937
Richard says
he doesn't want any.

04:30.003 --> 04:32.039
I don't want cheese.

04:32.105 --> 04:37.611
And James compares
a Ford GT40 to a Ferrari P3.

04:37.678 --> 04:40.180
Avanti!

04:40.247 --> 04:43.050
But first, if you are
watching this in America,

04:43.116 --> 04:44.818
you may be amazed to hear

04:44.885 --> 04:50.023
that the Ford Mustang
has never been sold,
officially, in the UK.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.760
Well, until now,
because Ford has now decided

04:52.826 --> 04:55.863
that the latest Mustang
will be sold in the UK

04:55.929 --> 04:59.032
with a V8 engine
and right-hand drive.

04:59.099 --> 05:03.471
Mm, and this has made
our other resident American
very happy.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.573
He was so excited, in fact,

05:05.639 --> 05:08.275
that when the first
right-hand-drive Mustang

05:08.376 --> 05:10.277
arrived at the docks
in the UK,

05:10.378 --> 05:12.680
he was actually there
to meet it.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.404
It'll be here any minute.

05:47.815 --> 05:50.317
That is it. Are we ready?

05:50.418 --> 05:53.821
This is the moment.
It's touched down!

05:53.887 --> 05:54.822
Go, go, go!

05:54.888 --> 05:56.957
* New World Symphony

06:02.463 --> 06:05.165
Look, it's a bit gloomy,
isn't it?

06:05.232 --> 06:08.769
It's not very welcoming.
Have you got anything
more upbeat?

06:08.836 --> 06:12.606
* When The Saints
Go Marching In

06:12.673 --> 06:14.442
Forget it!
Forget it! Forget it!

06:14.508 --> 06:16.577
-Forget it.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.584
I'm so excited,
my tinkle is fizzing.

06:30.891 --> 06:31.759
Oh, yeah!

06:31.825 --> 06:33.927
* National Anthem of USSR

06:37.798 --> 06:39.833
Oh. Sorry about that.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.935
We really are useless
over here.

06:42.002 --> 06:44.972
It's one of the reasons we
needed your help in the war.

06:48.308 --> 06:49.877
I decided that, first of all,

06:49.943 --> 06:52.179
I'd show
the new Mustang around,

06:52.245 --> 06:54.515
so I headed for London...

06:54.582 --> 06:56.116
which is the capital city.

07:15.969 --> 07:18.672
Ah, now,
this is Tower Bridge.

07:18.739 --> 07:21.742
Interesting.
It's very, very old.

07:21.809 --> 07:24.077
But it folds
completely in half

07:24.144 --> 07:27.047
so that, in the old days,
the horses could go through.

07:30.684 --> 07:33.253
Now, that's
the Houses of Parliament,

07:33.320 --> 07:36.757
which are a series of houses
in which we keep
all our idiots.

07:36.824 --> 07:40.427
That clock thing,
that's Big Ben.

07:40.528 --> 07:44.632
I know it's not what you call
big, but... but we couldn't
just call it Ben.

07:46.634 --> 07:49.302
And that is the Cenotaph,

07:49.369 --> 07:53.106
where we remember those
who died fighting for us.

07:54.441 --> 07:56.544
Slowing down a bit here.

07:56.610 --> 07:57.945
Show some respect.

08:00.881 --> 08:03.751
No idea what that is.
It wasn't here this morning.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.355
A cyclist, you want to be
careful of those.

08:08.421 --> 08:10.691
Small
but very angry creatures.

08:13.193 --> 08:15.262
That's the army.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.598
They're the ones
who shot at your White House.

08:17.665 --> 08:18.899
Sorry about that.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.636
Having seen
all of the sights,

08:22.703 --> 08:24.738
we headed out of town

08:24.805 --> 08:26.574
so I could do this.

08:31.078 --> 08:32.580
There it is.

08:32.580 --> 08:36.817
That is the soundtrack
that Britain has been missing
for 51 years -

08:36.884 --> 08:39.219
real American V8 muscle.

08:43.290 --> 08:46.960
We just don't make cars like
this on our side of the pond.

08:47.027 --> 08:50.798
All that
lazy-but-determined torque.

08:50.864 --> 08:54.802
Squeeze the throttle
in any gear at any speed...

08:54.868 --> 08:57.337
...and there's
an inevitability
to the way it moves off.

08:57.404 --> 09:00.608
It's like arm wrestling
a solar system -
you're gonna lose.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.820
It is weird...

09:12.886 --> 09:15.923
driving a Mustang
from this side.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.691
It's like suddenly
changing your mind

09:17.758 --> 09:20.794
after 50 years of marriage
and sleeping on the other
side of the bed.

09:22.763 --> 09:25.132
It's also weird
driving a car with a big V8,

09:25.198 --> 09:27.267
reversing camera,
air-conditioned seats,

09:27.334 --> 09:32.105
rain-sensing wipers
that you can buy for £37,000.

09:32.172 --> 09:35.643
That's half of what you'd pay
for a BMW M4. Half.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.081
Once we were in
the countryside proper,

09:41.148 --> 09:43.651
I continued
my sightseeing tour.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.855
Look, I've drawn your badge
on a hill.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.163
Jeremy did that one.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.735
Sorry.

10:04.137 --> 10:07.074
Eventually,
we arrived at Stonehenge.

10:09.576 --> 10:12.345
That,
you'll be amazed to learn,

10:12.412 --> 10:14.381
is an ancient calendar.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.418
Or a clock. Or a church.

10:18.485 --> 10:23.156
My tour of Britain
was then interrupted
by an unwelcome arrival.

10:25.425 --> 10:26.660
What are you doing here?

10:26.727 --> 10:29.562
Well,
I have come to remind you -

10:29.629 --> 10:31.398
cos you've obviously
forgotten,

10:31.464 --> 10:32.866
cos you're too giddy -

10:32.933 --> 10:36.003
that we have no need
for the Mustang in Britain.

10:36.069 --> 10:38.171
Because if you want to spend,

10:38.238 --> 10:41.341
what, £30,000-£35,000
on a fast Ford,

10:41.408 --> 10:44.878
you'd buy a Focus RS, cos
that was designed for here.

10:44.945 --> 10:47.514
No, you'd settle for that
in the UK

10:47.580 --> 10:50.317
because you couldn't
buy this, but now you can.

10:50.383 --> 10:51.719
That is the point.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.721
Would you wear chaps?

10:53.787 --> 10:55.923
No, because we have trousers.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.958
What about cowboy...
Oh, you are. Cowboy boots.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.693
Well, it's appropriate.
I'm welcoming...

10:59.760 --> 11:03.363
Listen, I don't want
everything from America,
I just want the Mustang.

11:03.430 --> 11:04.597
-Stupid.
-No, America--

11:04.732 --> 11:06.266
It wasn't designed for here.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.736
-Well, no.

11:08.736 --> 11:10.738
"It's cold out,
I'll wear a Stetson."

11:10.738 --> 11:12.639
No! You wear a bobble hat.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.374
That's a bobble hat.

11:14.441 --> 11:16.276
Oh! No, hang on.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.412
-I've just realised.

11:19.479 --> 11:22.015
Erm... I-I don't want
to talk to you any more.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.769
Anyway...

11:41.835 --> 11:45.405
Anyway, we shall
pick that up later on.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.975
But right now
it's time to drop it a cog

11:48.041 --> 11:51.779
and hook a left
into Conversation Street.

12:00.520 --> 12:03.791
-Serious. It's serious.
-It is serious stuff, this.

12:05.125 --> 12:07.360
Now, look, in Britain
we are always being told

12:07.427 --> 12:09.830
that the Scandinavians
are brilliant at driving,

12:09.897 --> 12:13.666
and that's because they would
be, because they have
to deal with all that snow.

12:13.801 --> 12:17.805
Mm, they're brilliant
because what they do
most of all is crash.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.672
Well, you're absolutely
right, as it turns out,

12:19.807 --> 12:22.542
cos I've got some interesting
statistics here. Erm...

12:22.609 --> 12:27.114
In Britain, 1.2% of accidents
result in fatalities.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.817
Here, I'm afraid, it's 5.1%.

12:29.883 --> 12:31.819
Yeah, and it's not just
the Finns, either,

12:31.819 --> 12:33.821
if I may be so bold.

12:33.821 --> 12:36.289
Our Senior
International Producer -

12:36.356 --> 12:37.825
that's his job title -

12:37.858 --> 12:39.592
came over to Finland
the other day,

12:39.659 --> 12:41.728
rented himself a BMW
at the airport -

12:41.829 --> 12:44.064
not a Ford or an Opel,
you'll note, a BMW -

12:44.131 --> 12:46.366
and on his way to
the location here,

12:46.433 --> 12:47.700
this happened.

12:47.835 --> 12:49.903
RICHARD: He did! He did!

12:49.970 --> 12:52.272
When I say he's our Senior
International Producer,

12:52.339 --> 12:54.842
he's now our Junior
International Producer.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.477
-Our Junior Local Producer.
-Yeah.

12:57.544 --> 13:00.247
Very local. Specifically,
the stationery cupboard.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.883
-He can produce that.
-That's all
he's in charge of.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.852
How did he do that?!

13:04.852 --> 13:08.255
The thing is, what I don't
understand is how the Finns
manage to go fast enough

13:08.321 --> 13:10.323
to have a crash
of any sort at all,

13:10.390 --> 13:13.593
because the speeding fines
here are insane.

13:13.660 --> 13:15.662
They're means tested,

13:15.728 --> 13:17.530
which means
a guy here recently

13:17.597 --> 13:20.267
was caught doing 49mph
through a 30 zone

13:20.333 --> 13:25.105
and he was fined
112,000 euros.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.040
-That's a speeding fine!

13:27.107 --> 13:29.009
Are they really that high
in Finland?

13:31.044 --> 13:32.345
A hundred and twelve...

13:32.412 --> 13:33.746
112,000.

13:33.881 --> 13:36.483
-Imagine getting that
in the post!
-Well, it's interesting.

13:36.549 --> 13:39.419
Actually, there was
a Finnish minister
recently said

13:39.486 --> 13:42.189
that the government
needs those speeding fines

13:42.255 --> 13:44.524
to balance the books,
they said.

13:44.591 --> 13:47.995
They actually said, "Speeding
is good for the country."

13:48.061 --> 13:50.363
-That is actually what...

13:50.430 --> 13:52.165
JEREMY:
Because it is. Every country.

13:52.232 --> 13:55.402
RICHARD:
Right. We should adopt that.

13:55.468 --> 13:58.271
-Speeding is good for you.
-It's your social duty.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.507
-A bit more conversation
for you.
-Oh, good!

14:02.142 --> 14:04.677
I think, with the exception
of Rolls-Royce,

14:04.744 --> 14:08.748
Volvo now make the best
car interiors of anybody.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.385
They do.
They're very, very good.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.421
I don't like to,
but I agree with you.

14:14.487 --> 14:18.158
because I went in the new S90
the other day,
and the interior is superb.

14:18.225 --> 14:20.693
-We've got
a picture of it here.
-Yes, that one.

14:20.760 --> 14:22.395
JEREMY:
They use pale colours.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.497
They've got pale-coloured
seats, pale-coloured carpets,
pale wood,

14:24.564 --> 14:27.400
and that makes it feel light
and airy and spacious.

14:27.467 --> 14:30.137
The only problem is
that in one of those

14:30.203 --> 14:33.473
you couldn't enjoy
a chocolate Magnum ice cream.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.576
It's all right,
I don't eat ice cream.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.645
It's something to do with
being straight.

14:41.581 --> 14:42.950
What

14:42.983 --> 14:44.317
Why are you applauding him?

14:46.954 --> 14:48.088
What do you mean?

14:48.155 --> 14:50.457
Are you saying
everyone who likes ice...?

14:50.523 --> 14:52.625
Ice cream is a bit,
you know....

14:52.692 --> 14:55.028
You're saying all children
are homosexual?

14:55.095 --> 14:56.363
-No, but...

14:56.429 --> 14:58.165
There's nothing
wrong with it,

14:58.231 --> 15:01.101
but a grown man
eating an ice cream,
you know, it's a bit...

15:01.168 --> 15:02.835
it's that way
rather than that way.

15:02.970 --> 15:04.171
-It is...

15:04.237 --> 15:07.007
Welcome to the inside of
Richard Hammond's head.

15:07.074 --> 15:09.109
I'm right. I can't believe
you can't see that.

15:09.176 --> 15:10.510
It's easy.
It's in front of you.

15:10.577 --> 15:13.480
You could enjoy a 99
in there.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.415
-No...

15:15.482 --> 15:18.151
Ninety-nine. But you couldn't
have the chocolate thingy.

15:18.218 --> 15:20.453
-My case rests!
-No, the chocolate thing!

15:20.520 --> 15:22.522
-Exactly!
-You know what I mean.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.992
No,
but if you had that Volvo,

15:25.058 --> 15:26.393
you could have
a white magnum...

15:26.459 --> 15:28.161
JEREMY: True.
-...or a Milky Bar.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.797
Yeah,
but not a Double Decker.

15:30.863 --> 15:32.199
Well, a Flake is worse.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.334
-No, Double Decker's worse.

15:34.401 --> 15:35.535
Double Decker...

15:35.602 --> 15:37.704
Do you all know what I mean
by the Double Decker?

15:37.770 --> 15:40.873
It is unique among chocolate
confectionery items.

15:41.008 --> 15:42.775
Take a bite
as you're driving along,

15:42.842 --> 15:45.012
and a bit about this big, OK,

15:45.078 --> 15:46.646
silently breaks away...

15:47.914 --> 15:49.916
...goes down
between your legs

15:50.017 --> 15:51.751
and melts.

15:51.818 --> 15:53.286
So when you get out,

15:53.353 --> 15:56.123
everybody thinks
you've had some kind
of trouser accident.

15:56.189 --> 15:59.559
This big brown stain right...

15:59.626 --> 16:02.495
-I know what you mean.
-It does happen.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.131
A Flake is worse.

16:04.197 --> 16:05.798
No, it just isn't!

16:05.865 --> 16:08.635
A Flake is advertised
as "the crumbliest,
flakiest chocolate".

16:08.701 --> 16:11.504
-It is worse.
-This is a hot topic on
Conversation Street.

16:11.571 --> 16:12.539
It is!

16:12.605 --> 16:14.607
I think we should settle it
here and now.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.876
I'm going to go into
our travelling box.

16:20.747 --> 16:23.883
Our travelling box of
chocolate confectionery,
and I'm going to...

16:23.950 --> 16:25.852
Let's settle it
with a competition, yes?

16:25.918 --> 16:27.320
I'm gonna give you
James's Flake

16:27.387 --> 16:29.222
and you the Double Decker.

16:29.289 --> 16:33.493
I'll turn that over, so then
you'll see how much spills
off as I eat the Flake.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.562
-This is scientific.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.865
Here we go. Oh.
Some of it's already crum...

16:38.931 --> 16:41.368
This is cheating, this one.

16:41.434 --> 16:43.103
RICHARD: OK, no,
clear away the debris.

16:43.170 --> 16:45.072
JEREMY:
No, I need to... Jesus!

16:45.072 --> 16:48.475
-That's part of eating it!
-It isn't part of eating it!
I haven't even begun.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.477
-But you've got to unwrap it.
-Ssh!

16:50.543 --> 16:51.444
Cheat.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.980
* Only the crumbliest *

16:54.081 --> 16:55.682
* Flakiest chocolate *

16:55.748 --> 16:57.617
-Oh, God.
* Tastes like choc... *

16:57.684 --> 16:59.852
-Jeremy,
you know that advert?

16:59.919 --> 17:02.089
-Girl in...

17:02.122 --> 17:06.126
Girl in the the field
of poppies - we're not
seeing that right now.

17:06.193 --> 17:07.694
-I am.
-I'm not.

17:07.760 --> 17:08.995
Right, ready? Watch this.

17:09.096 --> 17:11.098
RICHARD:
He's going in. First bite.

17:11.098 --> 17:12.865
Oh, it's a big fall
of chocolate!

17:12.932 --> 17:15.135
JEREMY: Mm.
-It's a heavy sprinkling,
that.

17:15.202 --> 17:17.204
That is just a light dusting
of chocolate.

17:17.270 --> 17:19.106
-A light dusting, yeah, OK.
-Right, James May.

17:19.139 --> 17:23.810
Moving over to James May
and his Double Decker.
This is exciting, isn't it?

17:23.876 --> 17:27.314
-This is a great
car programme.
-Groundbreaking stuff, yeah.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.582
-Quiet, please.
-I can't believe...

17:29.649 --> 17:33.019
-I can't believe this hasn't
been done before.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.122
He's going in.
He's taking a bite.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.991
His poor old gnash...
His teeth!

17:39.126 --> 17:40.393
-Oh!

17:40.460 --> 17:44.297
It's a catastrophic fall!
The clear winner...

17:44.364 --> 17:48.768
The Double Decker
is worse than the Flake.

17:48.835 --> 17:51.804
There's the Flake.
There's the Double Decker.

17:51.871 --> 17:54.541
So, there we are.
Using science,
we have now established...

17:54.607 --> 17:57.977
...if you've got a Volvo,
don't have a Double Decker.

17:58.044 --> 17:59.312
-Ever.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.848
Or an ice cream, because
he... Oh, no, forget it.

18:01.914 --> 18:05.952
Let's move a little further
along Conversation Street,
shall we?

18:06.018 --> 18:07.820
Erm...
A few weeks ago, Amazon,

18:07.887 --> 18:11.158
they ran an advert
for our show, and we're
rather pleased with it.

18:11.191 --> 18:12.425
See, it's got everything in.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.627
-Yeah, the sense of travel.
-Logo.

18:14.694 --> 18:17.063
-And there's even the goat.
-Yeah, no, that's perfect.

18:17.164 --> 18:21.000
-Everything you need there.
-All you need for the advert.
It's on the screen.

18:22.702 --> 18:27.073
Yeah. All the essentials are
there. Everything you need.

18:27.174 --> 18:28.541
Everything you need to see.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.779
JEREMY: Actually...

18:32.845 --> 18:33.980
All the important stuff.

18:34.046 --> 18:35.648
Hammond,
I'm sorry to do this,

18:35.715 --> 18:38.651
but before the show launched,
Amazon did another advert,
OK,

18:38.718 --> 18:41.654
which somebody sent to me
on a tweet,
which I screen grabbed,

18:41.721 --> 18:44.591
so the quality's not good,
but I have brought it along.

18:44.657 --> 18:45.825
Here it is.

18:45.892 --> 18:46.926
Oh, for God's sake!

18:52.632 --> 18:56.436
I like their marketing
department a lot.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.271
I think that's enough
Conversation Street,

18:58.338 --> 18:59.872
so let's get back
to our film.

18:59.939 --> 19:03.276
Yes. Earlier on,
I was in the right-hand-drive
Ford Mustang,

19:03.343 --> 19:05.345
showing it the sights
around our country.

19:05.412 --> 19:07.214
Unfortunately, he turned up

19:07.214 --> 19:11.418
and tried to argue that
the similarly priced
Ford Focus was a better bet.

19:11.484 --> 19:17.224
-Yeah, I did do that.
-I responded by driving off
and refusing to talk to you.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.591
A bit rudely, I thought.

19:24.731 --> 19:27.834
I'm sorry, this is my film,
my tour of England,

19:27.900 --> 19:30.437
and I didn't want him
spoiling it.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.243
This thing's bloody awesome.

19:38.811 --> 19:39.812
Listen to that bellow.

19:39.879 --> 19:42.014
This thing squats
on its haunches.

19:42.081 --> 19:44.651
This is what
it's built to do.

19:44.717 --> 19:50.690
Every crackle, pop and bang
is just connected to every
synapse and sinew in me.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.262
Oh, no.

20:00.567 --> 20:03.703
This is like a first date
for me, and on a first date,

20:03.770 --> 20:07.607
you don't want a fat,
balding uncle tagging along.

20:09.276 --> 20:12.211
So what I'm gonna do now...
is lose him.

20:16.516 --> 20:19.218
It's Hammer Time!
Shock and awe!

20:26.593 --> 20:28.661
It's Bond versus Bourne.

20:36.436 --> 20:40.307
He's got five litres.
I've only got 2.3.

20:40.373 --> 20:43.410
Is he going twice as fast?
No, he is not.

20:48.815 --> 20:51.651
Corner coming up.
There's no need to panic
any more in a Mustang,

20:51.718 --> 20:53.586
because, for the first time,

20:53.653 --> 20:55.988
the Mustang has
independent rear suspension.

21:02.161 --> 21:03.496
Ooh!

21:05.498 --> 21:09.702
The cornering speeds
this thing can achieve...
beggar belief.

21:20.413 --> 21:22.715
How does it grip that well?!

21:26.919 --> 21:30.256
I'm in a car chase
in a Mustang.

21:30.357 --> 21:31.724
I am Steve McQueen.

21:37.764 --> 21:39.466
Try that on.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.471
I've got it in Sport Mode,

21:44.537 --> 21:46.873
which makes the exhaust
pop and bang.

21:49.376 --> 21:51.010
Woohoo! Mine!

21:56.383 --> 21:57.684
RICHARD: Oh, my God!

21:59.051 --> 22:00.920
Flat out, yeah.

22:03.089 --> 22:05.191
And it still grips!

22:05.257 --> 22:08.695
What is the point of traction
control on this thing?

22:08.761 --> 22:11.864
It's like putting a
nymphomania control on a nun.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.711
Oh, God!

22:38.525 --> 22:40.727
Where's he gone?

22:42.328 --> 22:45.432
How did he do that?
How did he get away from me

22:45.498 --> 22:48.267
in something
from the 18th century?

22:48.334 --> 22:49.902
Especially when I'm driving

22:49.969 --> 22:54.306
what is basically
a turbocharged barnacle.

22:54.441 --> 22:59.479
This has the most
sophisticated
four-wheel-drive system

22:59.546 --> 23:01.013
fitted to any car.

23:03.583 --> 23:06.619
Not even a Nissan GTR
could live with this.

23:11.357 --> 23:13.960
The Mustang, well,
that's for cruising down

23:14.026 --> 23:18.030
the Pacific Coast Highway,
listening to Don Henley.

23:18.097 --> 23:21.033
This is for storming up
the Stelvio Pass,

23:21.100 --> 23:22.735
listening to the Clash.

23:26.105 --> 23:29.909
But while it's a grippy,
technological masterpiece,

23:29.976 --> 23:35.381
it still has the blue-collar
character of its ancestors.

23:35.482 --> 23:40.720
In many ways, this reminds me
of the old Escort Cosworth,
and that was a great car.

23:40.787 --> 23:43.523
I actually had one in
the '90s. I called it Gary.

23:43.590 --> 23:47.994
It started every morning
and it always went,
"Do you want some?!"

23:48.060 --> 23:50.563
It was just
John Terry, really,
with windscreen wipers.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.703
RICHARD: Meanwhile,
having got rid of the ape,

23:56.769 --> 23:59.739
I was back on
my sightseeing tour.

23:59.806 --> 24:02.542
This is our Cheddar Gorge.

24:03.943 --> 24:06.613
Obviously it's not as big
as your gorge.

24:06.679 --> 24:08.515
The Grand Canyon is bigger.

24:08.581 --> 24:11.851
Well, it's longer
and deeper... and wider.

24:11.918 --> 24:14.554
Mm. But it doesn't have
any cheese in it.

24:14.621 --> 24:16.288
Why can't you
just leave me alone?

24:16.355 --> 24:19.258
I'm just saying, everything
in America comes with cheese,

24:19.325 --> 24:20.927
apart from the Grand Canyon.

24:20.993 --> 24:24.697
Whereas this canyon
does come with cheese,
and it's delicious.

24:24.764 --> 24:26.398
-Here, have some.
-I don't want cheese.

24:26.533 --> 24:29.001
-It's better than
Monterey Jack in a tube.
-You're ruining this!

24:29.068 --> 24:31.838
No, you are, because
you are telling everyone

24:31.904 --> 24:36.375
that the Mustang is better
than the Focus.

24:36.442 --> 24:38.277
-Well, it is.
-It isn't.

24:38.344 --> 24:41.013
-It is.
-No, it isn't.

24:41.080 --> 24:44.083
Look, I'm not saying this
is perfect, cos it isn't.

24:44.150 --> 24:47.319
There's a vertical choppiness
to the ride,
which is annoying.

24:47.386 --> 24:50.289
If you put your phone
in the phone holder
in front of the gear lever

24:50.356 --> 24:52.692
and then accelerate,
it shoots under the seat.

24:52.759 --> 24:53.893
You never see it again.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.862
Petrol tank, way too small.

24:55.928 --> 24:59.566
-And the styling is a bit...
yobbish.
!

24:59.566 --> 25:01.067
But, Hammond, look at this.

25:04.103 --> 25:05.938
Oh, yeah, you're right.

25:06.005 --> 25:09.876
Half a century of Mustang
history, heritage and pride,

25:09.942 --> 25:14.681
but it hasn't got a small
plastic strip on the door
in case you're a bit clumsy.

25:14.747 --> 25:18.317
No, it's brilliant, that.
And... this is faster.

25:18.384 --> 25:20.452
Well, no, it isn't.

25:20.587 --> 25:23.389
-It is.
-No, it isn't.

25:23.455 --> 25:25.925
-It is.
-It isn't.

25:25.992 --> 25:29.596
RICHARD: At this point,
I decided to abandon my tour

25:29.629 --> 25:32.599
and head for
the nearest airfield...

25:32.665 --> 25:34.667
...to teach Clarkson
a lesson.

25:39.906 --> 25:42.642
Right,
I've got 410 horsepower -

25:42.709 --> 25:44.310
that's 100 more than him.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.779
But there's something else
on here that's missing
on his Focus,

25:46.846 --> 25:49.148
and it's this - "line lock".

25:49.215 --> 25:52.484
So, engage it.
Press OK to initialise.

25:52.619 --> 25:54.787
"Initialising.
Initialising complete.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.889
Firmly apply and hold brake
to engage.

25:56.956 --> 25:59.358
Engaged. Press OK to begin."

26:01.828 --> 26:05.197
What that's doing
is locking the front brakes,

26:05.264 --> 26:08.034
so I can warm up my tyres.

26:08.100 --> 26:13.305
Hm. That is an ideal feature
for people who wake up
in the morning and think,

26:13.372 --> 26:16.175
"Do you know, I've got
too much tread on my tyres."

26:22.815 --> 26:25.184
Yeah!
I'm doing that automatically!

26:32.524 --> 26:34.961
What a moron.

26:35.027 --> 26:36.729
With my tyres warmed up,

26:36.796 --> 26:39.131
I took my place
on the start line.

26:42.802 --> 26:46.305
Right, race mode,
launch control,

26:46.372 --> 26:49.475
over-boost facility
on the turbocharger,

26:49.541 --> 26:54.546
four-wheel-drive,
and a man with lightning
reactions at the wheel.

26:54.681 --> 26:59.218
This car is going to
boing off the line
like a spring lamb.

27:01.320 --> 27:04.556
Launch control, first gear,
and we're ready to go.

27:22.608 --> 27:25.311
Oh, he's away first.

27:25.377 --> 27:28.280
The most incredible
launch control in the world!

27:30.482 --> 27:32.518
Come on!

27:32.584 --> 27:35.187
Come on, Jeremy.
Come on. You're winning.

27:36.723 --> 27:38.524
RICHARD: Oh, reeling him in!

27:46.198 --> 27:49.535
No, no, no!
That's simply impossible!

27:49.601 --> 27:51.738
Well, bless him for trying.

27:55.975 --> 27:59.345
Things I don't want to see
right now - number one, him.

27:59.411 --> 28:01.213
So er... I won, then.

28:01.280 --> 28:06.853
-Yes, but your car
doesn't have a drift button.

28:06.919 --> 28:08.220
-A drift button.

28:08.287 --> 28:09.889
Well, you push it,
and then,

28:09.956 --> 28:13.359
when you go round a corner,
the car drifts.

28:13.425 --> 28:14.626
-Yeah.

28:14.761 --> 28:16.628
You know, I'd love
to see that in action.

28:16.763 --> 28:18.430
-I'd love to see
you doing that.
-Yes.

28:18.497 --> 28:20.933
-I'll watch. Yeah, show me.
-You stay there.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.870
You will not... Even
James May could drift this.

28:23.936 --> 28:25.938
-Here we go!
-I can't wait to watch.

28:34.981 --> 28:37.149
JEREMY: Check it out,
ladies and gentlemen!

28:37.216 --> 28:38.785
Check it out!

28:38.785 --> 28:41.253
I'm drifting.

28:41.320 --> 28:44.190
What do you think of
that, Hammond? Look at that!

28:50.196 --> 28:51.798
Hammond?

28:54.166 --> 28:55.802
Hammond?

28:57.136 --> 28:58.504
Hammond!

29:06.045 --> 29:08.080
What?
You're not gonna blame me.

29:08.147 --> 29:11.984
-Well, I left you because
you were being moronic.

29:12.051 --> 29:13.652
-I wasn't!
-You were!

29:13.719 --> 29:14.987
Seriously,
who is going to buy

29:15.054 --> 29:16.823
a Ford Focus when,
for the same money,

29:16.856 --> 29:18.690
you could have
a V8

29:18.825 --> 29:20.159
-No-one.

29:20.226 --> 29:23.830
Nobody would. Mustang's
got so much more character.

29:23.863 --> 29:25.297
Hang on.
So, you agree with me?

29:25.364 --> 29:26.732
Oh, God, yes!
If I had the choice
of those two cars,

29:26.833 --> 29:29.468
I'd have the Mustang
every day of the week.

29:31.070 --> 29:33.840
So you ruined my day out
for no reason at all?

29:33.906 --> 29:38.177
I ruined your day out
because it was fun...
to ruin your day out.

29:38.244 --> 29:40.512
-Good work.
-It was good work.
Sorry about that.

29:40.579 --> 29:44.917
But anyway, we must now
find out how fast those Fords
go round our track,

29:44.984 --> 29:50.156
and that, of course, means
handing them over to our
other resident American -

29:50.222 --> 29:54.861
a man who thinks that shower
gel is basically communist.

29:54.861 --> 29:55.928
It's the American.

29:57.363 --> 29:59.598
JEREMY: There he is,
looking bewildered.

29:59.665 --> 30:01.400
And he's away!

30:03.169 --> 30:06.305
It sounds like a bunch
of goddamn mice in there.

30:09.375 --> 30:12.244
Why the hell don't they just
start with eight cylinders?

30:12.311 --> 30:17.449
Strangest mice I ever heard,
as he powers down the Isn't.

30:17.516 --> 30:19.351
That is a good noise.

30:19.418 --> 30:22.554
Arms working the wheel
like he's wrestling
a drifter,

30:22.621 --> 30:24.056
which, of course, he is.

30:24.123 --> 30:26.225
And already he's at
Your Name Here.

30:26.292 --> 30:29.028
Tyres squealing,
but it's clinging on well,

30:29.095 --> 30:31.230
and now the climb
back onto the Isn't.

30:31.297 --> 30:33.099
It ain't got no room in it.

30:34.233 --> 30:36.535
No place to put your beer.

30:36.602 --> 30:40.739
I think he and I
look for slightly different
things in a car.

30:40.806 --> 30:43.009
Anyway,
now hard on the brakes

30:43.075 --> 30:46.645
as he turns into
Old Lady's House.

30:46.712 --> 30:49.481
Yeah, he is dispatching that
with no dramas,

30:49.548 --> 30:51.550
and now he can get
the hammer down

30:51.617 --> 30:53.886
for the bumpy sprint
to Substation.

30:53.953 --> 30:55.421
Looking good.

30:55.487 --> 30:57.523
Four-wheel-drive cars can,
of course, understeer,

30:57.589 --> 31:00.859
but... nope,
not a whiff of it here.

31:00.927 --> 31:04.830
And Field Of Sheep,
tidy through there as well,

31:04.931 --> 31:06.398
and across the line.

31:07.666 --> 31:11.037
Now, I think
he might enjoy this one.

31:11.103 --> 31:13.605
And he is
wheel-spinning away!

31:14.941 --> 31:17.243
All right!
American muscle, baby!

31:18.410 --> 31:21.247
5.0 Mustang -
this thing is badass.

31:24.650 --> 31:27.386
It's got a trunk,
a place for my golf clubs.

31:27.453 --> 31:31.023
Pack up the old lady,
go for the weekend
somewhere in this thing,

31:31.090 --> 31:33.425
and you can haul ass
while you're goin'.

31:33.492 --> 31:37.163
Something there about an old
lady and hauling a bottom.

31:37.229 --> 31:38.430
Anyway, he's on the Isn't,

31:38.497 --> 31:41.033
and he's flying into
Your Name Here.

31:41.100 --> 31:44.370
The mighty Mustang has filled
the American with vigour,

31:44.436 --> 31:46.372
and he's being
surprisingly tidy.

31:49.976 --> 31:53.445
That's what us Americans
want, we want to
smoke the tyres.

31:53.512 --> 31:57.083
We want this thing
to just get shit and get.

31:57.149 --> 32:00.752
Literally no idea what he's
on about. It's just a noise.

32:00.819 --> 32:03.990
When this thing stops, man,
it stops on a dime.

32:03.990 --> 32:07.759
"It'll stop on a dime
and give you nine cents
change" is what we say.

32:07.826 --> 32:09.996
You really can't shut him up
about this one.

32:09.996 --> 32:13.665
Anyway, he is keeping it neat
round Old Lady's House,

32:13.732 --> 32:17.136
and then unleashing
that V8 fury

32:17.203 --> 32:19.671
over the rough stuff
to Substation.

32:19.738 --> 32:23.275
Hard on the brakes,
ready for the 90 left.

32:23.342 --> 32:25.444
Blip it up to Field Of Sheep.

32:25.511 --> 32:26.845
Here we go.

32:26.912 --> 32:31.017
Flurry of exuberance,
and across the line.

32:31.017 --> 32:32.684
-There we are.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.523
OK, here's the Lap Board.

32:37.589 --> 32:41.827
Let's have a look, first of
all, where the Focus went.

32:41.893 --> 32:43.595
So...

32:43.662 --> 32:45.064
Oh, there it is.

32:45.131 --> 32:47.533
Faster than an ST200 -
perhaps not surprising.

32:47.599 --> 32:48.500
Just as well.

32:48.567 --> 32:51.870
Now let's bring up
the Mustang.

32:51.937 --> 32:53.339
-Oh!

32:55.574 --> 32:58.444
-That's not embarrassing,
is it?

32:58.510 --> 33:02.514
The car that you, me,
and the American all prefer

33:02.581 --> 33:05.817
is quite a lot slower
than the European Focus.

33:05.884 --> 33:07.119
RICHARD: Yes.

33:07.186 --> 33:08.954
Anyway, listen,
let's move on, shall we,

33:09.055 --> 33:11.490
to Celebrity Brain Crash.

33:19.098 --> 33:20.866
Now...

33:20.932 --> 33:25.171
our guest this week
isn't just my favourite
Formula One driver,

33:25.237 --> 33:27.439
he's also a local boy.

33:27.506 --> 33:31.577
Oh, yeah, this is
the chatty man of motorsport,

33:31.643 --> 33:32.811
Mr Effervescent,

33:32.878 --> 33:35.547
ladies and gentlemen,
Kimi Räikkönen!

33:37.083 --> 33:38.484
Here he comes.

33:41.220 --> 33:42.954
RICHARD:
What are we gonna ask him?

33:43.089 --> 33:44.690
It doesn't matter
what you ask him.

33:44.756 --> 33:48.494
It doesn't, because you won't
get a coherent answer.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.429
Is he all right?

33:52.098 --> 33:53.365
JEREMY: No, hang on. Whoa!

33:54.500 --> 33:56.402
RICHARD: Oh, no.
JEREMY: Not again.

33:58.170 --> 34:00.506
No, he has, I'm afraid,
ladies and gentlemen,

34:00.572 --> 34:02.908
literally drunk himself
to death.

34:03.975 --> 34:05.411
JEREMY: Damn.

34:05.477 --> 34:08.114
-Does that mean
he's not coming on, then?

34:08.114 --> 34:09.315
Well, his liver has failed

34:09.381 --> 34:10.816
and he's now
slowly solidifying

34:10.882 --> 34:14.820
in the freezing dusk of an
Arctic night, so that's a no.

34:15.987 --> 34:17.256
Yeah, but it doesn't matter.

34:17.323 --> 34:19.258
Well, it does, cos I actually
rather liked Kimi.

34:19.325 --> 34:22.561
But I can think of something
else we can do to fill the time.

34:22.628 --> 34:25.131
Here's the thing.
Er... If you're watching this

34:25.197 --> 34:27.766
on the day the programme
is actually released,

34:27.833 --> 34:30.402
it is December 23rd.

34:30.469 --> 34:32.671
There are two days to go
until Christmas,

34:32.738 --> 34:37.176
and if you're a man,
you won't have done
any shopping yet.

34:38.744 --> 34:40.812
-But don't worry,
cos we've got your back.
-Oh, yeah.

34:40.879 --> 34:43.215
We have trawled the Internet
and the shops

34:43.282 --> 34:45.917
to find the best gift ideas.

34:45.984 --> 34:51.423
Yes, and here, in our special
Grand Tour Santa Land Grotto.

34:51.490 --> 34:53.492
-Yeah.

34:53.559 --> 34:55.894
Nice view. Nice everything.

34:55.961 --> 34:57.163
Yeah. Er...

34:57.229 --> 35:00.166
We begin with this
rather brilliant tray,

35:00.166 --> 35:04.203
which, apparently, is
the ideal place to put your
laptop or your breakfast.

35:04.270 --> 35:06.238
We have a picture of it
in action here.

35:08.474 --> 35:11.577
RICHARD: Hang on a minute!
-I see a couple of problems
with that.

35:11.643 --> 35:13.512
RICHARD: I can too.

35:13.579 --> 35:16.315
Well, now, the reason
I don't play chess any more

35:16.382 --> 35:19.050
is it's just so exhausting
to move the pieces around.

35:19.185 --> 35:22.421
-I know what you mean.
-Far too heavy, picking the
Queen up and moving her.

35:22.488 --> 35:26.658
But it's OK, because Ferrari
has answered that problem
with this.

35:26.725 --> 35:30.362
-It's a lightweight,
carbon-fibre chess set...

35:30.429 --> 35:33.365
...and it's yours for £1,400.

35:33.432 --> 35:37.068
!
-£1,400.

35:37.203 --> 35:39.771
And that is the funny thing -
you take something ordinary,

35:39.838 --> 35:43.209
write a car name on it,
and suddenly
it becomes expensive.

35:43.209 --> 35:45.811
This bear, for example.
I know about bears.

35:45.877 --> 35:48.614
It's an acrylic fibre,

35:48.680 --> 35:50.649
stuffed with
industrial waste.

35:50.716 --> 35:51.817
£2.75.

35:51.883 --> 35:55.954
But, because it's got
a Honda T-shirt on, £10.

35:56.021 --> 35:57.088
-£10.

35:57.223 --> 35:59.024
Yes, but it's Honda Bear!

35:59.090 --> 36:00.326
-Or...

36:00.392 --> 36:02.361
I love that! On Christmas
morning, Honda Bear!

36:02.428 --> 36:04.530
I love following
his adventures!

36:04.596 --> 36:06.732
How about this
lovingly crafted

36:06.798 --> 36:10.001
"I love my Hyundai"
pillowcase?

36:11.303 --> 36:13.505
What woman is ever
going to leap into bed

36:13.572 --> 36:15.741
with a man whose pillows
bear that legend?

36:15.807 --> 36:18.477
OK, Hammond, I'll tell you
exactly what woman.

36:18.544 --> 36:21.413
The woman who would wear
this thong,

36:21.480 --> 36:24.149
which has written
lovingly on the front,

36:24.250 --> 36:26.017
the legend Elantra.

36:27.353 --> 36:29.355
Erotic! Erotic!

36:29.421 --> 36:35.561
Can I just say, the perfect
Christmas gift for the
Hyundai owner is a BMW.

36:35.627 --> 36:37.696
Well, yes, look, we realised
that branding stuff,

36:37.763 --> 36:42.268
obviously there's some money
in it, so we thought,
since we're in Scandinavia,

36:42.301 --> 36:47.072
we would launch our
own range of car-branded
Christmas jumpers.

36:47.138 --> 36:49.107
JEREMY: Mm-hm.
RICHARD: Oh, yeah. Yeah.

36:49.174 --> 36:51.977
-Talk among yourselves,
everybody.
RICHARD: Hold on a moment.

36:52.043 --> 36:54.580
JEREMY:
This is modelling time.

36:54.646 --> 36:57.916
Mine is a simple turtleneck.

36:57.983 --> 37:01.653
Very, very warm,
bearing the name of a legend
on the front.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.723
I know, it's very special.
Very Christmassy, yeah?

37:04.790 --> 37:08.360
-I have gone for
a very cuddly...

37:08.427 --> 37:10.662
...and Christmassy cardigan
bearing the name,

37:10.729 --> 37:13.665
as you can see,
of a car I absolutely adore.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.967
Yeah, and here's the thing,
OK.

37:16.034 --> 37:17.336
Mine is a crewneck, actually.

37:22.341 --> 37:23.675
Why is everybody...?

37:25.877 --> 37:28.914
RICHARD: I don't know.

37:28.980 --> 37:31.317
I think...

37:32.984 --> 37:34.986
Is it because they haven't
seen us in knitwear before?

37:36.722 --> 37:39.491
Anyway, we've had a go
at making some
Grand Tour-branded stuff.

37:39.558 --> 37:40.826
-Oh, yeah.
-But here's the thing.

37:40.892 --> 37:42.160
We haven't gone for
the obvious stuff,

37:42.227 --> 37:44.195
like jumpers
and mugs and umbrellas.

37:44.330 --> 37:47.766
We've gone for things
that other people
haven't thought of.

37:47.833 --> 37:49.134
Things like this -

37:49.200 --> 37:50.369
haemorrhoid cream.

37:51.703 --> 37:53.572
-We all need it.
-I don't.

37:53.639 --> 37:55.140
No, I don't, either.

37:55.206 --> 37:57.643
-Well, this is mine.

37:57.709 --> 38:01.012
Bought it for £2.75, but now
it's got Grand Tour on it,

38:01.079 --> 38:03.915
we could sell that for £20.

38:03.982 --> 38:06.918
I tell you what really good
idea we've had erm...

38:06.985 --> 38:09.821
is condoms, OK,
which have been...

38:09.888 --> 38:12.491
well, they've been branded
with well-known expressions

38:12.558 --> 38:14.460
and phrases
that we often say.

38:14.526 --> 38:16.895
-I'm gonna demonstrate
using this--
-Whoa!

38:18.063 --> 38:19.498
You flatter yourself, sir!

38:19.565 --> 38:21.900
-Au contraire.
Oh, really?

38:21.967 --> 38:27.005
So we simply roll the condom
over the rolling pin.

38:27.072 --> 38:30.409
Here it is. There's
the GT logo coming up.

38:30.476 --> 38:32.778
And on the other side,
"How hard can it be?"

38:32.844 --> 38:35.381
RICHARD: We're very pleased.

38:37.248 --> 38:40.819
JEREMY: Pretty damn hard,
for a man of my age.

38:40.886 --> 38:43.221
We're... We're very pleased
with these.

38:43.288 --> 38:46.758
Various of our slogans
have been used. I'm going
to put mine on this er...

38:46.825 --> 38:48.760
disappointingly small carrot.

38:49.861 --> 38:52.464
Erm... And it bears
one of my expressions.

38:52.531 --> 38:54.400
-See, I can't--
-Don't bite it!

38:54.433 --> 38:56.435
Well, I can't open the thing,
can I?

38:56.502 --> 38:58.269
No, there's one of those
little tear things.

38:58.404 --> 39:01.172
-Hold on, love.
I'll be with you in a minute.

39:01.239 --> 39:04.776
-No, it's--
-You're not gonna be here
to help me when I'm using it!

39:04.843 --> 39:06.412
-You don't know!
-I bloody do!

39:06.478 --> 39:08.547
-I might be.
-I'm pretty sure
you won't be.

39:08.614 --> 39:10.716
That's quite the wrong thing
to... Are you in?

39:10.782 --> 39:13.585
!

39:13.652 --> 39:15.120
-No.
-No, I want my glasses back

39:15.186 --> 39:17.723
before you start messing
around with sex things.

39:17.789 --> 39:20.025
Oh, right, let me...
Oh, dear. It's a bit baggy.

39:20.091 --> 39:22.260
I've actually torn it
with my teeth,

39:22.327 --> 39:25.330
which makes the slogan on it
quite appropriate, really -

39:25.431 --> 39:26.965
"That's not gone well."

39:28.634 --> 39:31.202
Can I just say, that is
by far and away

39:31.269 --> 39:33.939
the least
erotic thing I have ever...

39:34.005 --> 39:36.508
Don't tell me that's not
an unfamiliar sight.

39:45.283 --> 39:46.785
Oh,
have you done one as well?

39:46.852 --> 39:49.455
Of course I have.
Very sensibly,
I put mine on earlier.

39:49.488 --> 39:51.322
-Whoa!

39:51.457 --> 39:55.093
Branded with the GT logo and
my own personal catchphrase,

39:55.160 --> 39:56.662
"I was the first to arrive."

40:00.932 --> 40:05.804
Now, are you bored
with having two
fully functioning ankles?

40:05.871 --> 40:07.639
Yes?
Well, don't worry if you are,

40:07.706 --> 40:10.542
because this Christmas,
the market is awash
with products

40:10.609 --> 40:12.678
designed specifically
to break them.

40:12.744 --> 40:15.447
such as this iBot-9.

40:15.514 --> 40:17.048
I thought
that was a vacuum cleaner.

40:17.115 --> 40:18.149
No, it's incredibly heavy

40:18.216 --> 40:20.185
because it's
packed full of pain.

40:20.251 --> 40:23.388
Basically, you put these
things out on the side,
you stand and whizz about.

40:23.455 --> 40:26.558
But within seconds of getting
on, you will be falling over
and breaking your ankles.

40:26.625 --> 40:27.926
Probably so.

40:27.993 --> 40:30.696
Yes, and on the other hand,
there are also these.

40:30.762 --> 40:33.198
These are called
the Rocket Skates.

40:33.264 --> 40:35.734
They will cost you just £900,

40:35.801 --> 40:39.304
and they are guaranteed
to power you
straight to casualty.

40:39.370 --> 40:40.706
RICHARD: Yeah.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.708
-No, they're fine.
JAMES: No,
they're really not.

40:42.774 --> 40:46.545
-I'll be all right.
I could have a go on those.

40:46.612 --> 40:48.914
-You said it.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.916
Seriously.
I mean, honestly...

40:53.685 --> 40:55.386
"

40:55.453 --> 40:57.889
See, I knew it would
come in handy.
I can bludgeon...

40:57.956 --> 40:59.991
-Seriously, I'll have a go.
-Off you go, mate.

41:00.058 --> 41:02.661
-Yeah.
Can I wear my shoes in them?

41:04.930 --> 41:08.199
RICHARD: Yes, Jeremy,
apart from they've got wheels
and you're indoors.

41:08.266 --> 41:11.537
-I am not going near them.
-Just put my foot in them.

41:11.570 --> 41:13.705
I don't want to!

41:13.772 --> 41:16.742
-I can't see what I'm...
-It's degrading
and unpleasant.

41:16.808 --> 41:21.613
-Put your great cloven hoof
in there.

41:21.680 --> 41:24.082
It fits!
You can go to the ball.

41:24.149 --> 41:25.851
-There, you're in.

41:25.917 --> 41:28.019
-Thank you.

41:28.086 --> 41:29.420
You're not gonna do it!

41:33.091 --> 41:35.961
Have you started?
-Not yet.

41:36.027 --> 41:38.029
I better face the other way,
hadn't I?

41:39.631 --> 41:41.166
RICHARD: Looking good.

41:41.232 --> 41:42.467
These are worth every...

41:42.568 --> 41:44.636
What will they cost,
900 quid?

41:44.703 --> 41:46.572
-Nine hundred quid.
-Literally every penny.

41:46.572 --> 41:49.474
Wait, hold it there.
Hold it there.

41:49.575 --> 41:52.077
Look out, girls,
Mr Darcy's arrived.

41:53.344 --> 41:54.746
RICHARD: Looking good.

41:59.785 --> 42:02.120
RICHARD:
Oh, this is brilliant.
JAMES: Wow!

42:02.187 --> 42:06.124
I can see why they're called
Rocket Skates.

42:06.191 --> 42:09.027
-Come on, man.
Oh, God!
I'm trying to move!

42:09.094 --> 42:11.797
WOMAN: Lean back!
-What do you mean,
"Lean back"?

42:16.434 --> 42:17.836
Like that?

42:21.272 --> 42:23.308
Stephen Hawking would make
a better job of these

42:23.374 --> 42:24.810
Rocket Skates than you have.

42:26.812 --> 42:28.213
-Right...
!

42:28.279 --> 42:31.049
-You've got to get one...
RICHARD: Do you remember...

42:31.116 --> 42:34.252
RICHARD: Whoa!
It's a disaster!

42:36.622 --> 42:38.924
JEREMY: Shit. Sorry.

42:38.990 --> 42:41.492
Don't worry, Jeremy. I will
come and rescue on my...

42:41.627 --> 42:42.694
Bloody hell!

42:42.761 --> 42:44.630
-Oh, my God. It's going mad.

42:44.696 --> 42:46.297
Erm... Right. Right.

42:46.364 --> 42:49.635
-I put my foot on there.
-This is a really good
ambulance service.

42:51.970 --> 42:55.741
Yeah. Yeah. Don't worry,
I'll be there in a minute.

42:55.807 --> 42:58.109
I don't know that this works.

42:58.176 --> 42:59.678
-I've gone again!

43:00.812 --> 43:03.148
Shit! Now I've got cramp!

43:05.183 --> 43:08.086
That was...
That was a brilliant idea,
but never mind,

43:08.153 --> 43:10.722
because erm...
I have a perfect
Christmas present here.

43:10.789 --> 43:14.225
You control this
with your mobile phone
and your face comes on it.

43:14.292 --> 43:16.527
And the brilliant thing
about it is that it means

43:16.662 --> 43:21.667
you can have your favourite
celebrity round to your house
for Christmas lunch.

43:21.733 --> 43:25.570
With that in mind, ladies and
gentlemen, would you please
welcome into the studio -

43:25.671 --> 43:31.142
he's actually in his office
in London, and yet he's also
here on top of a stick -

43:31.209 --> 43:32.678
it's Bob Geldof!

43:36.047 --> 43:37.515
JEREMY:
We're gonna say hello to Bob.

43:37.582 --> 43:40.051
RICHARD:
I can't say hello to Bob!
-He's coming, Hammond.

43:40.118 --> 43:41.953
-I just go in circles!
-It is!

43:42.020 --> 43:44.055
It's Bob Geldof, everybody!

43:45.323 --> 43:47.358
Hello, Bob.
Where have you gone?

43:47.425 --> 43:49.027
Bob! We're over here, Bob!

43:49.094 --> 43:50.762
-Bob!
-Bob, we're over here!

43:50.829 --> 43:52.597
-He's there!

43:52.698 --> 43:54.866
Bob Geldof, how are you?

43:54.933 --> 43:56.902
Yes, happy Christmas!

43:56.968 --> 43:59.470
Oh, ! Sorry!

43:59.537 --> 44:02.140
-Are you having
a good Christmas, Bob?
-Oh, no! Bob's...

44:02.207 --> 44:05.576
Ladies and gentlemen,
Bob Geldof is lost!

44:05.711 --> 44:07.946
He's gone in the wrong...

44:08.013 --> 44:09.981
JEREMY: Oh, James May's
coming to join in.

44:10.048 --> 44:13.318
JAMES: I'm coming
to talk to Bob Geldof.

44:13.384 --> 44:16.321
RICHARD: Whoa!
JEREMY: May has kissed
Bob Geldof!

44:16.387 --> 44:18.890
-Get out of the way!

44:18.957 --> 44:20.992
-I'm travelling!
-No, straight ahead, Bob.

44:21.059 --> 44:24.329
Bob, no. Left-hand down, Bob.
No, Bob. Bob, you...

44:24.395 --> 44:27.032
Have I just attacked
somebody's knob?

44:27.098 --> 44:29.000
RICHARD: Bob,
stop attacking the crowd!

44:29.968 --> 44:31.202
Now where's he going?!

44:32.370 --> 44:34.305
Bob!

44:34.372 --> 44:36.607
JAMES: Right,
I'll rescue Bob. Hold on.

44:36.742 --> 44:38.276
Straight ahead, Bob.
That's perfect.

44:38.343 --> 44:41.279
-Straight ahead. Straight.
A bit of right-hand down.

44:41.346 --> 44:45.316
No, don't drive into it!
Stop head-butting the tree!

44:45.383 --> 44:46.952
This is ridiculous!

44:47.018 --> 44:49.587
Where's the reindeers
and Santa Claus at?

44:49.654 --> 44:53.358
RICHARD: Oh, no!
Hang on a minute!

44:53.424 --> 44:54.760
He's ruined Christmas!

44:54.826 --> 44:56.895
Does he know
it's Christmas time at all?

44:56.962 --> 44:59.164
Well, tonight, thank God
it's him instead of us

44:59.230 --> 45:00.766
knocking the Christmas
tree over.

45:00.832 --> 45:03.268
Absolutely right.
He's ruined it!

45:03.334 --> 45:04.469
Anyway, erm...

45:05.871 --> 45:08.373
This year marks
the 50th anniversary

45:08.439 --> 45:11.076
of the greatest
battle in motorsport history.

45:11.142 --> 45:13.244
The story begins
in the 1960s,

45:13.311 --> 45:17.115
when Ford realised that they
could sell a lot more cars

45:17.182 --> 45:20.218
if they were a lot more
successful on the racetrack.

45:20.285 --> 45:25.423
So they formulated
a brilliant plan,
but unfortunately...

45:28.459 --> 45:30.996
...it went disastrously
wrong, didn't it, Bob?

45:36.234 --> 45:39.370
Ford knew that if you wanted
to rule in motorsport,

45:39.437 --> 45:42.140
there was only one race
that mattered.

45:42.207 --> 45:45.110
The toughest and most
dangerous of them all -

45:45.176 --> 45:47.378
the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

45:47.445 --> 45:50.515
REPORTER: Levegh's Mercedes
collides and blows up.

45:50.581 --> 45:52.583
JAMES: The problem was,
for all its might,

45:52.650 --> 45:56.254
Ford didn't have a clue
how to win at Le Mans.

45:56.321 --> 45:59.958
However, over in Italy,
someone did.

46:08.133 --> 46:09.434
In the early 1960s,

46:09.500 --> 46:13.338
Enzo Ferrari's cars
ruled sports-car racing,

46:13.404 --> 46:14.940
Le Mans especially.

46:15.006 --> 46:16.307
At the start of the decade,

46:16.374 --> 46:18.977
he had won the famous
and gruelling 24-hour race

46:19.044 --> 46:21.412
three times on the trot.

46:21.479 --> 46:25.583
However, the company was in
deep financial difficulty,

46:25.650 --> 46:28.854
so when Ford offered to buy
the entire business,

46:28.854 --> 46:30.889
Enzo agreed.

46:33.691 --> 46:35.726
At first, all went well.

46:35.861 --> 46:40.265
Enzo Ferrari and the head
of Ford, Henry Ford II,

46:40.331 --> 46:44.569
quickly settled
on a price of $16 million.

46:44.635 --> 46:47.705
And on May 21st 1963,

46:47.772 --> 46:52.777
Ford executives arrived in
Maranello to sign the deal.

46:52.878 --> 46:55.246
Ford turned up
with an army of suits.

46:55.313 --> 46:57.182
Enzo Ferrari
sat opposite them

46:57.248 --> 46:59.550
with just
the local town lawyer.

46:59.617 --> 47:01.519
They read the contract
and all seemed well,

47:01.586 --> 47:03.654
but then, suddenly,
Ferrari stopped

47:03.721 --> 47:06.691
and he took out
his famous fountain pen
full of purple ink,

47:06.757 --> 47:09.928
and as you can see from this
accurate copy I have here,

47:09.995 --> 47:12.530
he drew a big exclamation
mark and he wrote,

47:12.597 --> 47:14.933
"No, that's no good!"

47:15.000 --> 47:18.003
Now, what had angered him?
Well, it was this clause
here.

47:18.069 --> 47:20.906
You see, Enzo Ferrari
wanted to retain control

47:20.972 --> 47:23.108
of the motorsport side
of his business,

47:23.174 --> 47:27.913
but this bit effectively
handed control to Ford.

47:27.979 --> 47:31.316
There followed
a tirade of abuse in Italian,

47:31.382 --> 47:34.119
after which,
Enzo said to his lawyer,
"Let's go and eat."

47:34.185 --> 47:38.723
Then they got up and they
simply walked out on the
stunned Ford executives.

47:38.789 --> 47:39.925
That was that.

47:39.991 --> 47:42.327
All of this for nothing.

47:43.628 --> 47:46.597
Back in Detroit,
Henry Ford II,

47:46.664 --> 47:48.399
apoplectic with rage,

47:48.466 --> 47:51.336
gathered his lieutenants
and issued the order:

47:51.402 --> 47:55.440
"Build me a car that will
crush Ferrari at Le Mans."

47:58.609 --> 48:00.845
To beat Ferrari
on European soil,

48:00.946 --> 48:03.248
Ford needed
European expertise,

48:03.314 --> 48:05.650
so he hired a small
British motorsport company

48:05.716 --> 48:09.187
that set up shop here,
in this very building,

48:09.254 --> 48:13.224
on an industrial estate in
Slough, just outside London.

48:13.291 --> 48:16.861
And the challenges
they faced were enormous.

48:16.962 --> 48:21.099
They had to build a car that
would race at over 200mph,

48:21.166 --> 48:22.968
which was something that had
never been done before,

48:22.968 --> 48:27.338
and it had to be reliable
for the 24 hours
of the Le Mans race -

48:27.405 --> 48:30.841
a race in which you
changed gear 9,000 times

48:30.976 --> 48:34.579
and drove flat out
for 3,000 miles.

48:34.645 --> 48:39.117
And, as if that wasn't
bad enough, they only had
ten months to do it.

48:43.688 --> 48:47.525
Out of that insane timetable
emerged this.

48:49.194 --> 48:51.096
The Ford GT.

48:51.162 --> 48:55.533
Thanks to its sleek shape
and the body that stood
just 40-inches tall,

48:55.600 --> 48:59.470
it promised to cut through
the air like a missile.

48:59.537 --> 49:01.606
Add a 4.2L V8,

49:01.672 --> 49:06.844
and the magic target
of 200mph seemed in the bag.

49:06.911 --> 49:11.716
The trouble is, a racing car
is just a collection
of hopes and dreams

49:11.782 --> 49:14.452
until it gets on the track.

49:14.519 --> 49:17.288
And that's something
that Ford learned
in a very brutal way

49:17.355 --> 49:22.060
when they took the GT40
to test at Le Mans
for the first time.

49:23.694 --> 49:26.631
REPORTER: And so to the first
Le Mans practice session.

49:26.697 --> 49:31.269
JAMES: On its first outing,
the renamed GT40 was fast,

49:31.336 --> 49:34.072
but it was also
terrifyingly unstable,

49:34.139 --> 49:37.142
spinning its wheels
on the straights.

49:37.208 --> 49:39.210
I'm not talking about
when you set off,

49:39.277 --> 49:42.647
I mean it was happening
at 170mph!

49:45.450 --> 49:48.753
Now, the problem was either
aerodynamics or suspension,

49:48.819 --> 49:50.155
but they never found out,

49:50.221 --> 49:55.560
because, later that day,
the car crashed at 160mph.

49:55.626 --> 49:58.396
Well, that was OK. They had
a spare one, of course.

49:58.463 --> 50:00.965
The next day,
that crashed as well.

50:01.066 --> 50:03.734
Le Mans
was just two months away.

50:06.671 --> 50:13.511
Against all odds,
Ford got their act together
in time for the 1964 race.

50:13.578 --> 50:15.646
REPORTER: The Le Mans
24 Hour Race at last,

50:15.713 --> 50:19.317
and three gleaming Ford GTs
are present.

50:19.384 --> 50:21.419
JAMES:
But during the race itself,

50:21.486 --> 50:24.955
all the cars broke down
or caught fire,

50:25.022 --> 50:27.024
leaving bitter rivals Ferrari

50:27.092 --> 50:31.062
to take another
one-two-three victory.

50:34.232 --> 50:38.069
In Detroit, Henry Ford
decreed that they would be
back next year

50:38.136 --> 50:40.271
to take on Ferrari again.

50:40.338 --> 50:42.173
And to head up the campaign,

50:42.240 --> 50:45.576
he turned to
an American motorsport hero.

50:45.643 --> 50:48.879
My name's Carroll Shelby and
performance is my business.

50:48.946 --> 50:52.049
Shelby was a former
chicken farmer from Texas

50:52.117 --> 50:55.553
who took nitroglycerin pills
to keep his heart going.

50:55.620 --> 50:57.988
But he'd also racked up
countless victories

50:58.055 --> 51:00.525
as a driver and team owner.

51:00.591 --> 51:03.494
Given the task of turning
the GT40 into a winner,

51:03.561 --> 51:05.863
he put his top man
on the job.

51:05.930 --> 51:07.432
Coming up is Ken Miles,

51:07.498 --> 51:11.136
one of the best
sport-car drivers in America.

51:11.136 --> 51:15.606
Miles was a former
Second World War tank
commander from Birmingham -

51:15.673 --> 51:18.509
the one in England,
not Alabama.

51:18.576 --> 51:20.478
He was renowned
for speaking his mind

51:20.545 --> 51:23.648
and developing racing cars.

51:23.714 --> 51:25.416
Miles took the car
for a shakedown.

51:25.483 --> 51:28.719
Then he got out
and he told Shelby
and the Ford executives,

51:28.786 --> 51:30.388
"It's bloody awful!"

51:30.455 --> 51:32.157
Then he got to work,

51:32.190 --> 51:34.659
improving the brakes,
the engine,

51:34.725 --> 51:36.694
the aerodynamics,
the handling,

51:36.761 --> 51:41.766
and taming
the car's terrifying
high-speed instability.

51:41.832 --> 51:44.869
However, and even though he
and his team took amphetamine

51:44.935 --> 51:46.737
so that they could
stay awake all night,

51:46.804 --> 51:51.776
there simply wasn't time
to develop the car properly
for Le Mans.

51:51.842 --> 51:54.179
The GT40
may have been faster,

51:54.245 --> 51:56.314
but it was still fragile.

51:56.381 --> 51:58.183
At the 1965 race,

51:58.249 --> 52:00.751
six cars started,
none finished,

52:00.818 --> 52:04.722
and the Italians
humiliated Ford once again.

52:06.791 --> 52:09.727
So, untold millions
of dollars had been spent

52:09.794 --> 52:13.331
since the first GT40 emerged
from this building here,

52:13.398 --> 52:17.502
and yet not one car
had even finished the race.

52:17.568 --> 52:19.270
So Ford now faced
a difficult choice -

52:19.337 --> 52:23.374
he could throw in the towel
against Ferrari,
or he could fight on.

52:23.441 --> 52:26.611
What he actually did was
he had some business cards
printed,

52:26.677 --> 52:29.214
and he distributed them
to his Le Mans team.

52:29.247 --> 52:32.350
And on the cards it said,
"You'd better win."

52:32.417 --> 52:33.984
And so, a year later,

52:34.051 --> 52:36.687
the American giant
returned to Le Mans

52:36.754 --> 52:40.791
with its hopes
resting on this.

52:48.333 --> 52:49.800
OK, viewers,

52:49.867 --> 52:54.872
this is historic-race-car
bucket-list moment
number two,

52:54.939 --> 52:57.675
because this is
an actual GT40

52:57.742 --> 53:01.479
that competed at Le Mans
in 1966.

53:03.881 --> 53:07.252
All right, don't go mad, May,
it's worth 15-million quid.

53:08.653 --> 53:11.256
Sod it!
Let's make some noise!

53:17.728 --> 53:18.663
Oh, yes!

53:21.366 --> 53:22.967
In this new GT40,

53:23.033 --> 53:26.937
Ken Miles had racked up
thousands of test hours.

53:27.004 --> 53:30.475
Now the car was no longer
horribly unstable,

53:30.541 --> 53:34.879
but would sit rocksteady
at 210mph.

53:34.945 --> 53:39.884
And the Brummie tank
commander had the backing of
Ford's huge R&D department,

53:39.950 --> 53:42.653
who tackled the car's
appalling reliability.

53:44.889 --> 53:47.558
The brakes no longer went
into thermal shock

53:47.625 --> 53:49.960
at the end of
the long straight.

53:50.027 --> 53:53.898
The engine and transmission
were run on
a computerised test rig

53:53.964 --> 53:58.035
that simulated the whole of
the 24-Hour Le Mans race.

53:58.102 --> 54:00.671
Now, that's standard practice
in Formula One today,

54:00.738 --> 54:04.409
but in 1966
that was witchcraft.

54:06.411 --> 54:09.347
They weren't mucking about,
these blokes.

54:09.414 --> 54:12.049
But neither were
the opposition.

54:12.116 --> 54:15.320
Over in Italy, in response
to the new threat,

54:15.386 --> 54:17.755
Ferrari produced this.

54:24.228 --> 54:28.899
Called the P3,
it looked as sleek as a GT40.

54:28.966 --> 54:33.771
And at just 37.4 inches tall,
it was even lower.

54:38.443 --> 54:40.378
Avanti!

54:43.348 --> 54:45.650
Whoo! Holy mother!

54:45.716 --> 54:49.053
I best be a little bit
careful on this narrow road.

54:49.119 --> 54:51.856
It's worth £20 million.

54:53.824 --> 54:59.364
Where the GT40 boasted
a top speed of over 210mph,

54:59.397 --> 55:02.600
the P3 maxed out at just 190.

55:02.667 --> 55:08.773
But Enzo Ferrari was willing
to trade outright speed
for gains elsewhere.

55:10.040 --> 55:12.510
The Ferrari was lighter,
it was more agile.

55:12.577 --> 55:15.946
Ferrari reckoned
he could make up
the difference in the bends,

55:16.013 --> 55:19.384
and he wouldn't have to stop
so often for fuel.

55:20.985 --> 55:24.489
A David and Goliath battle
was looming.

55:24.555 --> 55:30.094
At the 1966 Le Mans race,
Ford arrived with an armada -

55:30.160 --> 55:33.398
eight cars,
20 tonnes of spares,

55:33.464 --> 55:35.800
and a squad
of world-class drivers,

55:35.866 --> 55:38.436
including Ken Miles himself.

55:38.503 --> 55:42.907
In comparison, Ferrari turned
up with just a trio of P3s,

55:42.973 --> 55:44.875
but Enzo had an ace
up his sleeve -

55:44.942 --> 55:48.613
the undisputed
fastest driver on the planet,

55:48.679 --> 55:53.183
Formula One World Champion
John Surtees.

55:53.250 --> 55:59.590
He came to me and said,
"John... we've got to beat
the Fords. Go out and do it."

55:59.657 --> 56:01.225
I thought
there was only one tactic -

56:01.291 --> 56:04.929
to have at least one car
be the hare.

56:04.995 --> 56:09.434
I said, "Look,
I don't mind being the hare."

56:09.434 --> 56:11.235
"The moment
that flag goes down,

56:11.301 --> 56:13.237
we need to be - bang - off,"

56:13.303 --> 56:18.108
tempting the Ford drivers
to perhaps overdrive
a little bit.

56:18.175 --> 56:21.111
If one could push them
hard enough for long enough,

56:21.178 --> 56:26.316
then there is more
likelihood, obviously,
of being able to break them.

56:26.451 --> 56:28.152
The plan was set.

56:28.218 --> 56:32.457
But, as zero hour approached,
everything unravelled.

56:32.523 --> 56:35.693
REPORTER: Shortly before
the race, we learned that
he wasn't going to drive,

56:35.760 --> 56:37.495
and we asked him about it.

56:37.562 --> 56:41.265
Yes, unfortunately
you've heard correct.
I won't be driving.

56:41.331 --> 56:43.333
REPORTER: What is the reason?

56:43.468 --> 56:46.471
Well, I suppose it's best
summed up at this stage

56:46.504 --> 56:49.006
by saying
"political reasons."

56:49.073 --> 56:51.341
JAMES: The problem was that
the Ferrari team manager

56:51.476 --> 56:53.744
was playing
his own political game.

56:53.811 --> 56:56.213
He had no particular liking
for Surtees,

56:56.280 --> 56:57.848
and he nominated
another driver

56:57.915 --> 57:00.951
to go out and start the race,
to be the hare,

57:01.018 --> 57:06.591
even though Surtees
was clearly
the fastest man available.

57:06.657 --> 57:11.195
SURTEES: And I just stormed
away, drove back, and
had it out with the old man.

57:11.261 --> 57:13.498
As the Italian papers put it,

57:13.531 --> 57:17.602
they showed a picture
of me walking out the gates
and saying,

57:17.668 --> 57:22.507
"The divorce of John Surtees
and Enzo."

57:24.675 --> 57:26.777
With Surtees out of the way,

57:26.844 --> 57:30.014
the Fords took the top four
slots in qualifying.

57:30.080 --> 57:34.519
And as the clock ticked down,
Henry Ford II
prepared to drop the flag,

57:34.585 --> 57:40.424
praying that, this time,
he would get his revenge.

57:40.525 --> 57:44.194
REPORTER:
Live from Le Mans, France,
it's the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

57:57.007 --> 57:59.544
At first, the Fords
stormed into the lead.

57:59.577 --> 58:01.411
But a few hours in,

58:01.546 --> 58:07.552
it was beginning to look like
a depressing repeat
of '64 and '65.

58:07.552 --> 58:10.387
As night fell, the Ferraris,
using their greater agility

58:10.454 --> 58:12.356
and their greater
fuel efficiency,

58:12.422 --> 58:14.458
were leading the race
one-two.

58:14.559 --> 58:20.565
Four of the eight GT40s were
out of the race altogether.

58:20.598 --> 58:25.603
Worse still, the Ford drivers
had strict orders
not to go balls-out

58:25.670 --> 58:29.073
for fear
of breaking the cars.

58:29.139 --> 58:32.209
But one man wasn't listening
to those orders.

58:32.276 --> 58:34.144
Ken Miles
put the hammer down,

58:34.211 --> 58:37.815
set blistering lap times,
and retook the lead for Ford.

58:39.349 --> 58:42.587
The Ferraris had no response
to this crushing pace,

58:42.587 --> 58:46.791
and by morning,
they had either
broken down or crashed.

58:48.626 --> 58:51.696
That afternoon, Henry Ford
watched his cars cruise home

58:51.762 --> 58:55.099
to a spectacular
one-two-three finish.

58:58.202 --> 59:02.272
REPORTER: First place
for the Ford GT Mk II,

59:02.339 --> 59:06.443
and a first-time win
for America at Le Mans.

59:06.510 --> 59:10.615
JAMES: Ford would go on
to win their next four
Le Mans races.

59:10.615 --> 59:13.784
But the man
who had contributed
so much to the team

59:13.851 --> 59:15.920
didn't get to see
these triumphs.

59:15.986 --> 59:19.624
Ken Miles was killed two
months after their first win,

59:19.657 --> 59:22.326
testing the latest GT40.

59:24.629 --> 59:28.232
It's impossible to calculate
how much Henry Ford spent

59:28.298 --> 59:30.901
on his three-year campaign
to break Ferrari,

59:30.968 --> 59:33.203
but experts reckon that,
at the very least,

59:33.270 --> 59:38.709
in today's money,
it was £360 million.

59:38.776 --> 59:42.647
Now, that's a big bill
for settling a spat
with an angry Italian.

59:44.649 --> 59:47.184
But look what
we got out of it -

59:47.251 --> 59:49.887
one of the world's
greatest cars.

59:56.927 --> 59:58.395
RICHARD: Very good.

59:58.462 --> 1:00:00.364
That was good. Very good.

1:00:07.037 --> 1:00:09.139
-I hate you.
-I know.

1:00:09.206 --> 1:00:14.144
No, but I really hate you
now, cos you've driven a
Ford GT40, and I never have.

1:00:14.211 --> 1:00:16.847
I mean, next week
are you gonna lick
Helena Christensen?

1:00:16.914 --> 1:00:18.382
-Look...

1:00:18.448 --> 1:00:21.819
I'm sure you could drive a
GT40 if you really wanted to.

1:00:21.886 --> 1:00:23.387
I can't, I'm too tall.

1:00:23.453 --> 1:00:25.289
Yeah, you mean fat.

1:00:34.799 --> 1:00:37.201
-Tall.

1:00:37.267 --> 1:00:39.036
Horizontally tall.

1:00:40.237 --> 1:00:42.439
Well, listen, whatever
dimension is the problem,

1:00:42.506 --> 1:00:44.041
I can't drive one.

1:00:44.108 --> 1:00:47.044
And on that terrible
disappointment,
it is time to end.

1:00:47.111 --> 1:00:49.613
Thank you so much
for watching. Good night.
