00:00.766 --> 00:02.834
Specialty tool week
here on <i>tool time.</i>

00:02.835 --> 00:04.669
We're doing our salute...

00:04.670 --> 00:06.671
To salutes.

00:09.875 --> 00:11.442
Tim.

00:13.212 --> 00:17.415
Could we...?
We bet we could, fella.

00:17.416 --> 00:21.252
We're doin' our salute
to binford's new line
of tools just for the ladies.

00:21.253 --> 00:24.689
That's right. Like this:
Binford's lightweight
lady binford drill.

00:24.690 --> 00:27.692
It's 30% lighter,
which every woman likes
in a tool.

00:27.693 --> 00:29.427
As well as herself.

00:32.765 --> 00:37.301
These tools are fine for home,
but what about a woman
out on a formal affair?

00:37.302 --> 00:41.906
For that, we recommend
binford's gal on the go
evening bag. Heidi?

00:41.907 --> 00:43.675
<i>(sophisticated music)</i>

00:43.676 --> 00:47.145
<i>(audience)</i> whooh!

00:47.146 --> 00:50.281
As you can see,
sequins on the outside,
tools on the inside.

00:52.084 --> 00:53.752
A broken heel?
Not a problem.

00:53.753 --> 00:56.320
You have a small
hammer with nails.

00:58.357 --> 01:00.058
Problem zipper?
Not a problem.

01:00.059 --> 01:02.794
You have a set of pliers.

01:02.795 --> 01:05.263
Unsightly nose hair?
Not a problem.

01:07.033 --> 01:11.136
Needle nose pliers.

01:11.137 --> 01:14.039
But let's face it, ladies,
if you have unsightly nose hair,

01:14.040 --> 01:16.374
You're not invited out
to many formal affairs anyway.

01:16.375 --> 01:18.409
Thank you, heidi.
Thank you, tim.

01:18.410 --> 01:20.545
What about the woman
that's not good
with tools in general?

01:20.546 --> 01:24.282
For that, we recommend
the tool man in a tote.

01:24.283 --> 01:26.350
One quick pull...

02:47.366 --> 02:49.600
What do you think? Could we
put the kids in the middle?

02:55.074 --> 02:57.408
Hey, randy,
wanna play some catch?

02:57.409 --> 03:00.879
I can't.
I'm doing my homework.

03:00.880 --> 03:02.580
"dear molly..."

03:02.581 --> 03:04.916
Hey, get out of here. I don't
want you reading my homework.

03:04.917 --> 03:08.286
It doesn't look
like homework to me.

03:08.287 --> 03:11.322
"when I think of kissing you,
my heart beats like a symphony."

03:15.727 --> 03:17.929
It's for music class.

03:20.599 --> 03:24.102
Oh, yeah?
Then who's molly?

03:24.103 --> 03:27.272
That shows how
much <i>you</i> know.

03:27.273 --> 03:29.307
Molly is a
musical instrument.

03:30.976 --> 03:33.544
You know what I think?

03:36.048 --> 03:39.550
I think you've got a new
girlfriend. Who is she?

03:39.551 --> 03:41.452
Will you promise
not to tell anybody?

03:41.453 --> 03:43.354
She's that ugly?

03:45.457 --> 03:47.525
I don't know
what she looks like.

03:47.526 --> 03:51.930
We've been sending love letters
through the singles bulletin
board on the computer.

03:51.931 --> 03:55.800
So when are you
gonna meet her?
Never. She's 25.

03:59.138 --> 04:03.708
No way. Why would a 25-year-old
girl be interested in you?

04:03.709 --> 04:07.411
Because she thinks
I'm a 32-year-old dermatologist.

04:08.881 --> 04:12.050
And where did
she get that idea?

04:12.051 --> 04:13.551
That's what I told her.

04:13.552 --> 04:16.954
I also told her I'm 6'4"
and drive a ferrari.

04:16.956 --> 04:21.759
Hm. Wait till she finds out
you're 4'6" and pedal a schwinn.

04:25.464 --> 04:28.466
Well, that's the beauty of this.
She's never gonna find out.

04:28.467 --> 04:31.903
She lives in st. Louis.

04:31.904 --> 04:33.371
What's that?

04:33.372 --> 04:35.639
It's one of dad's old love
letters he wrote to mom.

04:35.640 --> 04:37.808
They go over really great.

04:40.579 --> 04:43.214
"my darling, I wish you
had been here this weekend

04:43.215 --> 04:45.950
"to share one of the most
exciting moments of my life:

04:45.951 --> 04:49.254
Two-for-one day at sears."

04:54.760 --> 04:57.828
Mom, do we have
any styrofoam balls?
No.

04:57.829 --> 04:59.530
Just make him some
of your meatballs.

05:02.167 --> 05:03.968
Very funny.
Ha-ha-ha.

05:03.969 --> 05:08.472
Sorry, mark.
The closest thing I've got to
styrofoam are these rice cakes.

05:08.473 --> 05:11.675
They have to be spheres.
Sorry.

05:11.676 --> 05:15.313
I'm making a solar system
for my science project.

05:15.314 --> 05:17.581
Science project?

05:17.582 --> 05:19.884
You know, I helped randy
make that volcano.

05:19.885 --> 05:21.685
He got a d.

05:24.023 --> 05:29.593
Tim... I think that mark is
smart enough to handle this
project by himself.

05:29.594 --> 05:31.529
Jill...

05:31.530 --> 05:33.932
I think it'd be a lot more fun
if we did it together.

05:33.933 --> 05:36.000
I don't want you
taking it over.

05:36.001 --> 05:38.436
There's nothing wrong
with a father helping his son
with a science project.

05:38.437 --> 05:40.038
My father helped me.

05:40.039 --> 05:42.540
That was for the safety
of the neighborhood.

05:45.010 --> 05:47.545
Mark is never gonna
learn anything
if he doesn't do his own work.

05:47.546 --> 05:50.214
That's right, dad.
You stay out of this.

05:50.215 --> 05:52.083
This is between
your mother and me.

05:52.084 --> 05:55.320
Tim!
Ok. I'll just watch.

05:55.321 --> 05:57.621
I'll guide him.

05:59.091 --> 06:01.359
What have you got planned
for that solar system?

06:01.360 --> 06:05.729
Well, the plan was
to hang a bunch of
styrofoam balls on wires.

06:05.730 --> 06:07.932
You can't just
hang 'em on wires.

06:07.933 --> 06:09.900
First, you gotta get the right
proportions for the planets.

06:09.901 --> 06:13.604
Then the right distance from the
sun - that is perfect, there.

06:13.605 --> 06:16.607
Dad, I thought you
were just gonna watch.

06:16.608 --> 06:19.077
I am. I'm just tellin' you
what I wanna see.

06:25.717 --> 06:28.719
Mark, here's the styrofoam
balls for the planets.

06:28.720 --> 06:31.755
Dad, there's not
that many planets.
Sure there are.

06:31.756 --> 06:35.126
Neptune, jupiter, saturn,
mars, venus, earth,

06:35.127 --> 06:39.464
Mercury, ford, chevy, volvo...

06:39.465 --> 06:43.301
Yugo? That planet
was destroyed.

06:45.170 --> 06:48.306
I guess I'm ready
to paint the planets.
This is real tricky.

06:48.307 --> 06:51.809
Make sure the pigment's
evenly distributed
over the surface of the...

06:51.810 --> 06:54.445
Evenly.

06:54.446 --> 06:56.414
All right.
But, you know...

07:01.387 --> 07:03.954
All right. Good.

07:03.955 --> 07:08.592
It's your project. You move on
to something more important
and I'll try to even this out.

07:08.593 --> 07:11.329
What should I do?
Bend the wires
for the orbits.

07:12.131 --> 07:14.132
Ok.

07:18.470 --> 07:22.173
Straight.
Straighten it out.

07:22.174 --> 07:24.175
Straight.

07:25.411 --> 07:27.412
You got...

07:32.084 --> 07:34.152
Here. Now.

07:34.153 --> 07:37.522
You don't wanna
waste time with this.
What should I do?

07:37.523 --> 07:41.392
You wanna monitor
the air exiting
the surface of the paint.

07:42.894 --> 07:46.664
What does that mean?
Watch the paint dry.

07:46.665 --> 07:50.834
<i>(doorbell)</i>
I'll get it.
Don't touch anything.

07:53.238 --> 07:55.239
<i>(doorbell)</i>
I'll get it!

07:58.143 --> 08:00.010
Hi!
Hi.

08:00.011 --> 08:03.081
I'm molly.
Good golly.

08:03.082 --> 08:05.083
<i>(laughs)</i>

08:07.386 --> 08:09.820
This is molly.

08:09.821 --> 08:13.224
And who are you?
I'm tim's wife, jill.

08:13.225 --> 08:16.961
Who's tim?
The man you're
holding hands with.

08:16.962 --> 08:19.663
Oh! I'm sorry.
I thought you were randy.

08:19.664 --> 08:22.567
We've a 12-year-old
boy named randy.
12?

08:22.568 --> 08:28.839
The randy taylor I've been
corresponding with over the
computer is a dermatologist.

08:28.840 --> 08:33.311
Honey, has randy been skipping
the sixth grade and going
to medical school again?

08:33.312 --> 08:34.678
Are you sure you have
the right house?

08:34.679 --> 08:37.615
Yes. I even sent him
software at this address.

08:37.616 --> 08:41.184
Um, why don't you come in?
I think I may know
what's going on here.

08:41.186 --> 08:47.024
Um, what else did this randy
taylor tell you about himself?

08:47.025 --> 08:49.827
Just that he has
two annoying brothers,

08:49.828 --> 08:51.095
His mother can't cook,

08:51.096 --> 08:54.832
And he has an
accident-prone father.

08:56.235 --> 08:59.370
I'm glad I'm not
in <i>that</i> family.

08:59.371 --> 09:02.273
Tim, we are that family.

09:02.274 --> 09:05.843
Except for that cooking thing.

09:05.844 --> 09:09.880
Oh, I can't believe
I have been corresponding
with a 12-year-old.

09:09.881 --> 09:13.817
Well, he's very
mature for his age.
Yeah! You're not kidding!

09:13.818 --> 09:17.388
His letters were very
romantic. And funny.

09:17.389 --> 09:21.692
The only really strange thing
was his obsession with sears.

09:27.266 --> 09:30.168
There's nothing
wrong with that.

09:30.169 --> 09:34.805
You know, he said
my wit was "as sharp
as a radial arm saw,"

09:34.806 --> 09:37.475
And he compared
the glow of the moon to...

09:37.476 --> 09:41.512
The headlights of a 1957
buick roadmaster convertible?

09:41.513 --> 09:45.183
How did you know that?
Tim wrote that
to me in a letter.

09:45.184 --> 09:48.352
I did?

09:48.353 --> 09:49.887
That's good!

09:51.156 --> 09:55.059
Randy's been copying
your old love letters!

09:55.060 --> 09:57.428
Oh, molly,
I am so sorry.

09:57.429 --> 10:01.265
Nah, it's ok. I was in town
on business anyway.

10:01.266 --> 10:03.901
Besides, he's just a kid.
I wouldn't be too hard on him.

10:03.902 --> 10:05.869
Well, you're not us.

10:07.606 --> 10:09.307
We're parents.

10:09.308 --> 10:14.245
When our kids play doctor,
we nail 'em for malpractice.

10:17.549 --> 10:20.117
Brad, get in here.

10:20.118 --> 10:23.554
I got a new message
from molly in my mailbox.

10:23.555 --> 10:25.556
What's it say?

10:27.092 --> 10:28.859
"my darling randy,

10:28.860 --> 10:31.195
"I'm leaving on a business
trip in a few minutes

10:31.196 --> 10:34.098
"and I'll be
in detroit tomorrow.

10:34.099 --> 10:38.636
I thought I'd stop by
your house at about 2:00."

10:45.176 --> 10:47.177
Uh-oh.

10:50.382 --> 10:53.984
"I can't believe we're finally
gonna meet. Love, molly.

10:53.985 --> 10:57.821
P.S. I also got a huge growth
I want you to look at." ugh!

11:06.998 --> 11:10.234
Randy, you've gotta write her
back and stop her from coming.

11:10.235 --> 11:12.670
It's too late.
She's already left.

11:12.671 --> 11:16.507
Then you better learn how
to remove a growth real quick.

11:18.143 --> 11:21.779
Oh, man, I am in big trouble.
What am I gonna do?

11:21.780 --> 11:23.648
All right.
How about this?

11:25.484 --> 11:28.886
Molly's never seen what you look
like, so when she gets here,

11:28.887 --> 11:31.656
Tell her randy taylor moved out
and we're the new owners.

11:34.859 --> 11:36.927
Ok, ok. That's pretty good.

11:36.928 --> 11:40.097
But what if mom and dad
get to the door before I do?

11:40.098 --> 11:43.467
Then you don't have
anything to worry about
'cause you'll be dead.

11:55.714 --> 12:00.150
Hey, mom. Are you and dad
gonna be here tomorrow,
say, around 2:00?

12:00.151 --> 12:02.019
Dad's gonna be
at the office,

12:02.020 --> 12:03.554
And I was thinking
about going shopping.

12:03.555 --> 12:06.223
They're having a sale
at a boutique I love.

12:06.224 --> 12:08.225
Great. Fantastic.
Best thing you can do.

12:08.226 --> 12:12.496
Although... I don't know.
I may just stay home.

12:12.497 --> 12:15.566
Sales are really
a big pain in the butt.

12:15.567 --> 12:19.804
All these women elbowing
each other out of the way
just to save 40 cents on a bra.

12:19.805 --> 12:23.841
Well, you know,
you should go shopping.

12:23.842 --> 12:27.044
You could use a new bra.

12:30.982 --> 12:33.651
Really? How would
<i>you</i> know that?

12:34.753 --> 12:38.656
Dad told me.

12:38.657 --> 12:42.226
He also told me that
the last time you bought a bra,
it didn't look too good.

12:42.227 --> 12:47.030
So you should take your time
and try 'em all on.

12:47.031 --> 12:51.435
I really don't think your
father should be talking
about stuff like that with you.

12:51.436 --> 12:56.807
Well, you know, he seemed
pretty disturbed by it.

12:56.808 --> 13:02.413
But I guarantee you,
if you find the right bra,
the problem will be solved.

13:02.414 --> 13:03.481
Good luck, mom.

13:06.985 --> 13:09.687
Well, I finished
paintin' my sun.

13:09.688 --> 13:12.222
Mark, randy or brad?

13:13.625 --> 13:16.527
Oooh, funny,
wilson, funny.

13:16.528 --> 13:19.263
I just hope you get a better
grade on mark's solar system

13:19.264 --> 13:21.532
Than you did
on randy's volcano.

13:23.535 --> 13:25.135
Mark's been helpin' a lot.

13:25.136 --> 13:28.439
See this perfectly
bent rod here?

13:28.440 --> 13:29.874
Mark bent that?

13:29.875 --> 13:32.543
No, I bent it,
but he handed it to me.

13:32.544 --> 13:36.447
You know, tim, I'm reminded
of an ancient chinese proverb:

13:36.448 --> 13:39.450
"give a man a fish
and you feed him for a day;

13:39.451 --> 13:42.853
Teach a man how to fish
and you feed him
for a lifetime."

13:42.854 --> 13:46.757
If I let mark do this himself,
he's gonna learn more
than if I finish it.

13:46.758 --> 13:48.091
Very good, tim.

13:48.092 --> 13:51.995
But chinese proverbs aren't
gonna win any science fairs.

13:51.996 --> 13:56.066
If I let mark do it all himself,
there'd be no craftsmanship,
no attention to detail.

13:56.067 --> 13:58.602
He's the son of "the tool man."
what would people say?

13:58.603 --> 14:00.504
About mark, or about you?

14:05.911 --> 14:07.812
I get it,
I get it.

14:07.813 --> 14:10.080
But there's one thing -
if I let mark do it all,

14:10.081 --> 14:13.451
I won't get to glue anything.

14:13.452 --> 14:16.520
Dad? I'm going over
to bobby's house.

14:16.521 --> 14:19.323
Call me when I've finished
my science project.

14:19.324 --> 14:22.760
Not so fast. Not so fast.
This is <i>your</i> science project.

14:22.761 --> 14:25.429
You're gonna do some
of the work here.

14:25.430 --> 14:27.465
It's like that old
chinese proverb.

14:27.466 --> 14:32.603
You can teach a young fish
to dance, but once it gets old,
it sticks with you forever.

14:35.307 --> 14:37.641
It's specialty tool week
here on <i>tool time.</i>

14:37.642 --> 14:42.279
We'll show you tools you won't
necessarily find in your
neighborhood hardware store.

14:42.280 --> 14:45.415
These tools you might have
to go to outer space to find.

14:45.416 --> 14:49.487
To tell us about them,
the men responsible for fixing
the hubble space telescope

14:49.488 --> 14:52.823
Are in detroit to judge the
science fair at the detroit
science center.

14:52.824 --> 14:55.025
Give a big welcome
to the astronauts,

14:55.026 --> 14:58.428
The crew of the <i>endeavour</i>
space shuttle!

14:58.429 --> 15:00.430
<i>(cheering and whistling)</i>

15:09.941 --> 15:12.109
I understood there
was a woman on the crew.

15:12.110 --> 15:13.911
That's right, tim.
Kathy thornton.

15:13.912 --> 15:18.616
But someone had to stay back at
nasa and do all the hard work.

15:18.617 --> 15:22.686
Let's meet mission commander
dick covey. How you doin', sir?

15:22.687 --> 15:25.088
<i>(applause)</i>

15:25.089 --> 15:29.326
Dick supervised
the entire servicing
of the hubble space telescope.

15:29.327 --> 15:32.362
What's it like working
with tools in outer space?

15:32.363 --> 15:35.165
Well, tim, it's a lot like
using tools here on earth,

15:35.166 --> 15:40.070
Except there's no gravity, so
you don't have to worry about
droppin' a tool on your foot.

15:44.009 --> 15:47.711
Sounds like the perfect working
environment for <i>you,</i> tim.

15:50.015 --> 15:54.384
He's very funny.
Yeah. A regular astro-nut.

15:55.854 --> 15:58.556
Tim, it's pronounced
astro-naut.

15:58.557 --> 16:01.592
Yeah, I know that.
It was a little joke.

16:01.593 --> 16:04.762
Oh, sorry.
I had no idea.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.068
This is ken bowersox.

16:11.069 --> 16:13.370
He is a navy man,
just like me,

16:13.371 --> 16:16.440
And his friends here
nicknamed him sox.

16:16.441 --> 16:19.409
I suppose you got that
nickname because up in space
you never change your socks?

16:19.410 --> 16:22.345
Hoo, boy!

16:22.346 --> 16:25.549
No, tim, they call
me that because my
last name is bower <i>sox.</i>

16:25.550 --> 16:28.686
They could call you bower.

16:28.687 --> 16:30.821
They don't.

16:34.859 --> 16:38.261
Payload commander
story musgrave.
Story, what's the story?

16:38.262 --> 16:41.364
Like I haven't heard
that one a million times.

16:43.969 --> 16:46.804
I hear you're a big
fan of the show.
Yes, I am.

16:46.805 --> 16:50.173
But not as big a fan
as my fellow spacewalker,
jeff hoffman.

16:50.174 --> 16:52.042
Hi, jeff.
How you doin'?
Hey, tim.

16:52.043 --> 16:56.513
Yeah, I have lots of friends
and family out here, and we
think you are the greatest.

16:56.514 --> 16:58.949
Safe to see who my
favorite astronaut is.

16:58.950 --> 17:02.419
You know, on one
of our spacewalks
on the hubble mission,

17:02.420 --> 17:05.155
We all let out
a big tim taylor grunt.

17:05.156 --> 17:07.557
<i>(gruffly)</i> no!
<i>(gruffly)</i> yes!

17:07.558 --> 17:09.960
I brought a tape.
You guys wanna see the tape?

17:09.961 --> 17:11.394
Yeah!

17:11.395 --> 17:14.564
Heidi, the monitor, please.
Here you are, tim.

17:14.565 --> 17:15.866
Thank you, heidi.
You're welcome.

17:15.867 --> 17:19.569
All right, folks.
The first grunt in space.

17:21.239 --> 17:24.441
<i>Here it comes.</i>
<i>Think we could rewire it?</i>

17:24.442 --> 17:27.344
<i>(all grunt like tim)</i>

17:27.345 --> 17:29.412
<i>That sounds</i>
<i>like a good idea.</i>

17:29.413 --> 17:31.982
<i>(cheering and whistling)</i>

17:36.254 --> 17:37.988
You might say...

17:37.989 --> 17:40.524
One small <i>(grunt)</i> for man

17:40.525 --> 17:43.193
One big <i>(three grunts)</i>
for mankind.

17:43.194 --> 17:45.195
<i>(all grunt)</i>

17:47.098 --> 17:50.500
Next we have flight engineer
claude nicollier.

17:50.501 --> 17:52.102
He's all the way here
from switzerland

17:52.103 --> 17:55.505
And was one of two
astronomers on the crew.

17:55.506 --> 17:57.507
Claude, my son is doing a
science-fair project right now.

17:57.508 --> 17:59.442
Any advice for him?

17:59.443 --> 18:01.111
Well, sun in the middle...
Right.

18:01.112 --> 18:02.813
...Nine planets...
Uh-huh.

18:02.814 --> 18:06.116
...But don't let
your father help you.

18:11.156 --> 18:15.759
All right. But last, surely
not least, we have tom akers.

18:15.760 --> 18:18.461
He was the hubble
tool specialist.

18:18.462 --> 18:21.965
I brought some of the tools
we used to work on
the hubble space telescope.

18:21.966 --> 18:25.268
Cool!

18:25.269 --> 18:28.238
Wow. Tools from space.

18:28.239 --> 18:30.941
What I wouldn't give to have
one of these on my shop wall.

18:30.942 --> 18:33.811
That's a three-eighths-inch
drive mctether ratchet.

18:33.812 --> 18:36.279
They use this for playing
mctether ball out there.

18:41.720 --> 18:46.690
And next we have a...
Hey, where's my power tool
with the adjustable extension?

18:52.063 --> 18:53.731
You guys probably
forgot to bring it.

18:53.732 --> 18:56.133
No, I saw you working
with it earlier, tim.

18:56.134 --> 18:58.168
I wasn't working
with it earlier.
Yes, you were.

18:58.169 --> 19:02.239
Tim, is this what
you're looking for?
Oh, that! That's it?

19:02.240 --> 19:05.909
Heidi, where'd you find that?
Doesn't matter where.
She found it.

19:05.910 --> 19:07.911
It was in tim's locker.

19:11.249 --> 19:14.952
<i>(high-pitched)</i>
well, I... See, I...

19:14.953 --> 19:16.220
<i>(normal)</i> I was gonna
bring it back.

19:16.221 --> 19:18.188
It was just...
I thought...

19:18.189 --> 19:20.590
Whooh!

19:20.591 --> 19:23.093
Taylor, we're gonna
need this back too.

19:23.094 --> 19:25.395
How did that get in there?

19:28.532 --> 19:30.533
We'll be right back
after these messages
from binford.

19:33.738 --> 19:35.906
<i>(doorbell)</i>

19:38.810 --> 19:40.543
Hi.
Hi. Can I help you?

19:40.544 --> 19:42.212
I'm looking
for randy taylor.

19:42.213 --> 19:44.314
There's no randy taylor here.

19:44.315 --> 19:45.983
And who are you?

19:45.984 --> 19:49.519
A kid.

19:49.520 --> 19:53.991
That's strange. Dr. Taylor's
gotta be here. I just sent him
something to this address.

19:53.992 --> 19:56.726
Uh... He moved out yesterday
and we moved in today. Bye.

19:58.096 --> 20:00.497
I don't see
any moving boxes.

20:00.498 --> 20:04.701
Well, uh...
We're a circus family.
We unpack fast.

20:04.702 --> 20:07.570
Did dr. Taylor leave
a forwarding address?

20:07.571 --> 20:12.075
Uh... No, but he mentioned
joining the peace corps
in china.

20:12.076 --> 20:14.278
That seems
very strange.

20:14.279 --> 20:18.148
Not really. They're having
a big acne epidemic in beijing.

20:19.350 --> 20:20.684
Hi, randy.
I'm back.

20:20.685 --> 20:23.687
Randy?
She means andy.
I'm andy.

20:23.688 --> 20:25.755
Hi. Who is this?
I'm molly lauden.

20:25.756 --> 20:28.525
I was looking for randy taylor.
This is randy taylor.

20:28.526 --> 20:30.894
Randy, andy, candy, sandy.
I answer to anything.

20:33.698 --> 20:37.935
This is really weird,
because I have been getting love
letters from a randy taylor,

20:37.936 --> 20:39.769
But he's much
older than you.

20:39.770 --> 20:43.740
He says he loves me
almost as much as his
cast-iron scroll saw.

20:43.741 --> 20:46.009
Wait a minute.

20:46.010 --> 20:49.847
Cast-iron scroll saw?
Mm-hm.

20:49.848 --> 20:53.683
Well, I think I know
what's going on here.

20:53.684 --> 20:55.252
You do?

20:55.253 --> 20:59.089
My husband always used to write
about a cast-iron scroll saw

20:59.090 --> 21:01.624
In all of his
love letters to me.

21:01.625 --> 21:05.295
He must be writing you
love letters and then
just signing our son's name.

21:08.266 --> 21:11.568
He never told me
that he was married.

21:11.569 --> 21:14.872
But it doesn't matter because
I love him and he loves me.

21:14.873 --> 21:18.976
I should've seen this coming
when he started hating my bras!

21:22.480 --> 21:25.315
Mom, you don't understand.
Hi, honey.

21:25.316 --> 21:28.618
Don't "hi, honey" me,
you two-timing tool twit!

21:30.288 --> 21:32.489
What'd I do?

21:32.490 --> 21:36.326
You don't have to play dumb.
Your wife knows all about us.
"us"?

21:36.327 --> 21:39.329
Take your tools
and move in with molly.
No, mom...

21:39.330 --> 21:41.265
Who's molly?
I am!

21:41.266 --> 21:43.901
Now kiss me like you said
you would in your letter.

21:43.902 --> 21:46.003
I don't know what I said,
but what the heck!

21:46.004 --> 21:49.239
Dad, stop!
Don't kiss her!
Mind your own business.

21:49.240 --> 21:53.176
Look, I'm the one
who wrote the letter.

21:53.177 --> 21:55.145
I used your old love letters.

21:55.146 --> 21:57.180
I was just trying
to have a little fun.

21:57.181 --> 22:00.384
Are you having
a little fun now?
Not particularly.

22:00.385 --> 22:03.320
The jig's up, dr. Taylor.

22:03.321 --> 22:06.223
You guys set me up!

22:06.224 --> 22:08.058
You knew about this all along.

22:08.059 --> 22:10.327
That's right, doc.

22:10.328 --> 22:13.297
I can't believe
I was outsmarted by my parents.

22:18.702 --> 22:22.539
Mark, how'd the science
project go?
Great. I got an a.

22:22.540 --> 22:24.174
Congratulations!

22:24.175 --> 22:26.243
Did you get to use
the modification you put in?

22:26.244 --> 22:30.580
My teacher wouldn't let me.
She thought it was <i>your</i> idea.
What?!

22:30.581 --> 22:35.919
Hi-de-ho, neighbors. Oh, mark!
That is quite a solar system!

22:35.920 --> 22:38.221
Thank you.
You ought to see the
super-orbital part of it.

22:38.222 --> 22:40.523
He used one of my little motors.
Show him.

22:44.462 --> 22:46.696
Oh, that is very impressive.

22:46.697 --> 22:49.766
Wait a minute. You haven't seen
warp speed yet. Try that one.

22:54.272 --> 22:55.839
Uh-oh.

22:55.840 --> 22:58.375
Chip off the old block.
<i>(grunts)</i>

23:01.513 --> 23:05.548
We would like to present
to the cast and crew
of <i>home improvement</i>

23:05.549 --> 23:08.151
A flag and a patch
and some pictures.

23:08.152 --> 23:12.255
The flag and patch flew
with us on our mission
to the hubble space telescope.

23:12.256 --> 23:15.558
It's traveled about
four million miles and...

23:15.559 --> 23:18.996
Lots of power.
Yeah. Tim, if you
could step up...

23:18.997 --> 23:20.998
<i>(cheering and applause)</i>
