WEBVTT

00:08.050 --> 00:11.053
-We're live in five minutes, folks.
-[crew member] Make way.

00:11.136 --> 00:14.181
Someone find out the average rainfall
in Bora Bora.

00:14.265 --> 00:15.808
Thank you so much for doing this.

00:15.892 --> 00:19.520
Hey, there are a lot of advantages to
being the girlfriend of a big celebrity.

00:19.604 --> 00:20.813
It's more than being an elbow

00:20.897 --> 00:23.274
they couldn't crop out of
a red-carpet shot in US Weekly.

00:23.357 --> 00:26.068
-I've been that elbow.
-Hello, what have we here?

00:26.151 --> 00:28.070
So you know
how the game's played, right?

00:28.153 --> 00:30.155
I'm sure I'll pick it up.
How hard could it be?

00:30.281 --> 00:32.241
You didn't read the treatment?
I faxed it to you.

00:32.323 --> 00:34.911
My bad, our fax machine
isn't plugged in.

00:34.994 --> 00:36.746
BoJack, this is our first show

00:36.829 --> 00:39.665
and it is very important that things
run smoothly tonight.

00:39.749 --> 00:41.709
I mean, do you even care
about this at all?

00:41.793 --> 00:45.379
Sweetie, no. I think this is stupid
and a waste of everybody's time.

00:45.463 --> 00:47.757
But you're my girlfriend
and I care about you.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.175
-So I'm here.
-Okay. Break a leg.

00:50.259 --> 00:53.846
[vocalizing] Me, me, me. My, my, my.
Bow-wow-wow-wow.

00:53.930 --> 00:56.056
Good boy, good boy.

00:56.140 --> 00:58.726
Okay, this is it, everybody.
Moment of truth.

00:58.810 --> 01:00.436
Now it's in the hands of god.

01:00.519 --> 01:03.689
And for the next 30 minutes,
I am that God.

01:03.773 --> 01:05.942
-I got you an iPad, ma'am.
-Oh, no thanks, Mia.

01:06.025 --> 01:09.028
I'm still working my way through
the last 30 years of technology.

01:09.111 --> 01:10.404
Right now I'm on Palm Pilot.

01:10.488 --> 01:13.032
But you can use our second screen app
to see what viewers say

01:13.157 --> 01:14.366
about the show as it airs.

01:14.450 --> 01:18.203
Oh, cool,
I love stupid bullshit like this. Ooh.

01:18.287 --> 01:19.413
Oh, you just touch it.

01:19.497 --> 01:24.502
Hello, I am Mustache Todd.
Like regular Todd, but with a mustache.

01:24.585 --> 01:28.631
Listen boo-boo, I didn't graduate first in
my class from a prestigious university,

01:28.714 --> 01:31.300
rise through the ranks at
an elite news organization,

01:31.383 --> 01:34.012
win a well-known award,
never ever be sick at sea

01:34.094 --> 01:38.057
and also my name is Mia McKibben,
so that I could deal with your nonsense.

01:38.140 --> 01:40.142
-[grunts]
-Todd, stay out of Hair and Makeup.

01:40.225 --> 01:41.352
But I like it there.

01:41.435 --> 01:44.229
They brush my hair and tell me stories
about their weekends.

01:44.313 --> 01:47.483
Big-nosed Todd wasn't funny,
Zombie Todd wasn't funny,

01:47.566 --> 01:49.234
Pretty Lady Todd wasn't funny,

01:49.318 --> 01:51.529
and this isn't funny.
No more tomfoolery.

01:51.612 --> 01:54.198
When it's me,
we call it "Todd-foolery."

01:54.323 --> 01:56.492
We certainly do not call it that.

01:56.575 --> 01:57.576
Listen up, everyone.

01:57.660 --> 01:59.829
What you are part of tonight
is bigger than you.

01:59.912 --> 02:01.205
It's bigger than any of us.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.041
I expect all of you to work together.

02:03.123 --> 02:06.251
But I also expect that one of you
will tower above the rest.

02:06.335 --> 02:11.757
And that outstanding individual
will receive this pen.

02:11.841 --> 02:14.218
It was through this pen that I bled

02:14.301 --> 02:17.805
Raise High The Roof Beam,
Carpenters upon the page.

02:17.889 --> 02:19.515
Also, it has four different colors.

02:19.598 --> 02:22.309
Black, red, blue
and for some reason, green.

02:22.393 --> 02:23.644
By the end of tonight,

02:23.728 --> 02:27.481
this pen will be bestowed upon
the person most deserving.

02:27.565 --> 02:30.192
Because nothing is more
important than television,

02:30.275 --> 02:34.072
and no one more important than
the people who make that television.

02:34.154 --> 02:38.158
-Now, let's get to work.
-[AD] And five, four,

02:38.283 --> 02:41.662

03:38.719 --> 03:42.389
[announcer] Live from the historic
Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip,

03:42.473 --> 03:43.808
J.D. Salinger Presents:

03:43.891 --> 03:46.811
Hollywoo Stars And Celebrities,
What Do They Know?

03:46.894 --> 03:49.730
Do They Know Things?
Let's Find Out!

03:49.939 --> 03:51.149
[howls]

03:51.231 --> 03:54.902
Ah. All right! Here we go.

03:54.986 --> 03:56.028
Listen to that crowd.

03:56.112 --> 03:58.156
If they lose it this much
for Mr. Peanutbutter,

03:58.238 --> 04:00.950
can you imagine what they're going to
do for a real celebrity?

04:01.075 --> 04:04.286
Hey, this is Mr. Peanutbutter's show,
so be nice.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.413
When you say nice, do you mean kind?

04:06.497 --> 04:08.332
Or, like,
delivering a lot of sick burns,

04:08.415 --> 04:10.876
so that people in the audience go,
"Nice."

04:10.960 --> 04:13.587
The first one. Obviously the first one.

04:13.671 --> 04:16.007
Tonight we answer the age-old question:

04:16.089 --> 04:18.968
"Hollywoo stars and celebrities,
what do they know?

04:19.051 --> 04:21.428
Do they know things?
Let's find out!"

04:21.637 --> 04:23.639
-[audience cheering]
-[music resumes]

04:23.848 --> 04:25.432
And now our first-ever guest.

04:25.516 --> 04:27.977
You know him from his years on
Horsin' Around,

04:28.060 --> 04:29.770
his drunk appearance on The View,

04:29.854 --> 04:34.150
and his bestselling book,
it's BoJack Horseman.

04:34.233 --> 04:36.401
-[audience cheering]
-[BoJack chuckles]

04:36.485 --> 04:38.029
There you are. How are you doing?

04:38.112 --> 04:40.280
-BoJack, welcome.
-It is great to be here.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.992
Sorry, no time for idle chit-chat,
because we've entered

04:43.075 --> 04:45.161
-the Small Talk Round.
-The what now?

04:45.536 --> 04:47.205
[dramatic music plays over speakers]

04:47.412 --> 04:50.624
Thirty seconds on the clock.
BoJack, how are you?

04:50.708 --> 04:53.085
-Uh, fine?
-Correct.

04:53.169 --> 04:55.171
-Did you see the game last night?
-No, I don't follow--

04:55.254 --> 04:56.421
-[Peanutbutter] Oh.
-[buzzer sounds]

04:56.505 --> 04:59.091
Oh, so sorry.
It says here you did see the game.

04:59.175 --> 05:00.176
[buzzer sounds]

05:00.259 --> 05:01.719
-What game?
-[J.D.] Ready camera one? Camera one.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.470
You tell me.
You're the one who saw it.

05:03.679 --> 05:04.805
-[audience laughs]
-I don't--

05:04.889 --> 05:07.850
-[woman screams] God, no!
-[BoJack gasps]

05:07.933 --> 05:09.268
-What the--?
-That noise means

05:09.351 --> 05:11.937
it's time for your first
General Knowledge question.

05:12.021 --> 05:14.773
Audience, does BoJack know things?

05:14.857 --> 05:17.235
[audience] Let's find out!

05:17.317 --> 05:20.988
BoJack, what is the average
annual rainfall in Bora Bora?

05:21.072 --> 05:24.742
-Uh, this is general knowledge?
-It's just an average we're asking for.

05:24.867 --> 05:28.328
-I don't know, seven?
-Wrong! So wrong.

05:28.412 --> 05:30.081
Wow, when it comes to Bora Bora,

05:30.164 --> 05:33.542
maybe this celebrity should
have studied more-a more-a.

05:33.625 --> 05:36.461
[J.D.]
Yes, Mr. Peanutbutter. Go for the kill.

05:36.545 --> 05:38.964
-That doesn't really seem--
-[woman] They're all dead!

05:39.048 --> 05:41.050
I watched them die!

05:41.133 --> 05:42.760
-What is--?
-Oh-ho. That sound means

05:42.843 --> 05:44.553
it's time to pick your category.

05:44.636 --> 05:50.517
"Trigonometry." "Advanced Physics,"
and "At the Movies With Mr. Peanutbutter."

05:50.601 --> 05:52.394
At the Movies With
Mr. Peanutbutter.

05:52.477 --> 05:56.815
Good choice. After seeing J.J. Abrams'
Star Trek reboot, did I call it:

05:56.899 --> 05:59.068
A, "A visual feast for the senses,"

05:59.151 --> 06:01.987
B, "A zestful lark through time
and space,"

06:02.071 --> 06:05.199
C, "The best Zachary Quinto movie
of all time,"

06:05.324 --> 06:07.492
or D, "All of the above"?

06:07.576 --> 06:11.663
-I'll say D?
-Ouch, the answer was A and B.

06:11.747 --> 06:13.249
Though I would
also agree with C.

06:13.332 --> 06:16.418
So I told Mr. Peanutbutter
I'd drive him here,

06:16.501 --> 06:19.379
and next thing I know,
I'm an Associate Producer.

06:19.463 --> 06:21.757
Stupid me. I went to Stanford.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.551
Next time I'll just try that
thing where I'm a huge dumbass

06:24.635 --> 06:26.804
who happens to be friends
with Mr. Peanutbutter.

06:26.887 --> 06:27.805
-Yup.
-Cool.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.723
Well, have fun watching me
win that pen.

06:29.807 --> 06:30.849
I don't need a pen.

06:30.933 --> 06:35.687
I can walk into any Chili's with a child
under 12 and get crayons for free.

06:35.771 --> 06:37.022
You don't get it.

06:37.106 --> 06:39.858
If Salinger gives you his pen,
that means you're worth something.

06:39.942 --> 06:42.736
It means you're a serious person
who's going places.

06:42.820 --> 06:46.698
Actually, you know what?
Don't worry about it. It's not for you.

06:46.949 --> 06:47.992
[groans]

06:48.200 --> 06:50.535
I'm gonna go with nuclear fusion.

06:50.619 --> 06:53.038
-[buzzer sounds]
-Oh, the answer is Egypt.

06:53.122 --> 06:55.833
Turn up the directional heat lamps.
Oh, yeah.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.335
Let's really make him sweat.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.129
Surprised you didn't get that one,

07:00.212 --> 07:03.924
since you're an expert
when it comes to de-Nile.

07:04.008 --> 07:06.760
Quick impression. [drinks]
"I'm not an alcoholic."

07:06.969 --> 07:09.013
[laughs] You love it.

07:09.096 --> 07:13.142
Oh, yeah, pretty good one from King Mutt
over here. Am I right?

07:13.225 --> 07:15.602
You know, like King Tut?

07:15.686 --> 07:18.939
Because we're talking about Egypt?
And Mr. Peanutbutter's a mutt, so...

07:19.982 --> 07:21.441
You suck.

07:21.525 --> 07:23.027
I'm a yellow lab, BoJack.

07:23.110 --> 07:26.030
-You could get one thing right tonight.
-[audience laughs]

07:26.113 --> 07:29.074
Anyway, let's take a moment
to look at the great comments

07:29.200 --> 07:31.202
we've been getting on
our second screen app,

07:31.285 --> 07:32.577
now available for download.

07:32.661 --> 07:35.080
And we're out.
Fifteen seconds, everybody.

07:35.164 --> 07:37.499
-Hey, how am I doing?
-You're kind of being a dick.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.459
Hey, are we at Tony Roma's right now?

07:39.543 --> 07:41.712
Because there's a lot
of ribbing going on here.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.797
I'm not ribbing you.
I'm telling you, you're--

07:43.881 --> 07:47.718
-And we're back in three, two...
-[music plays]

07:47.801 --> 07:48.844
Welcome back.

07:48.927 --> 07:52.848
Will BoJack Horseman go down in show
history as our worst contestant ever?

07:52.931 --> 07:54.641
So far, yes.

07:54.850 --> 07:55.934
[audience chuckling]

07:56.018 --> 07:58.437
Wow. J.D., people are loving this show.

07:58.520 --> 08:03.150
Wait till they see this.
Mia, get ready to drop the bomb.

08:03.234 --> 08:05.277
[woman] Death from above!
[Bojack gasps]

08:05.736 --> 08:09.740
Uh-oh. That sound means it's time
to drop "da" bomb.

08:09.865 --> 08:11.992
And yes folks, I said "da," not "the."

08:12.076 --> 08:14.412
What I'm trying to say is,
it's a positive bomb.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.121
Audience, let's...

08:16.205 --> 08:18.582
[audience] Drop da bomb!

08:18.665 --> 08:21.460
Did you guys all practice
before the show, because--

08:22.794 --> 08:26.215
Ladies and gentlemen, we've had
some fun with our little celebrity.

08:26.298 --> 08:28.467
But now, let's meet our big celebrity.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.886
-Big celebrity?
-Say hello to...

08:30.969 --> 08:34.597
-Daniel Radcliffe!
-Hi, I'm Daniel Radcliffe. Hello.

08:34.765 --> 08:37.393
-Oh, my God! It's Daniel Radcliffe!
-[audience cheering]

08:37.476 --> 08:41.397
We'll find out what our big celebrity
knows right after this break.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.856
[BoJack groans]

08:43.065 --> 08:46.735
And we're out.
Oh, we're cooking now.

08:47.736 --> 08:49.696
Hey, you, you're doing great.

08:49.780 --> 08:51.656
I'm not 100 percent watching

08:51.782 --> 08:53.700
because I'm so engrossed
in the second screen experience,

08:53.784 --> 08:55.786
but according to
the second screen experience,

08:55.869 --> 08:57.621
other people are loving the show.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.748
You didn't tell me
there would be another celebrity.

08:59.831 --> 09:01.375
Well, I had no idea that was coming

09:01.459 --> 09:05.170
but some guy named Dong-Slinger-420
loved the surprise.

09:05.254 --> 09:07.172
He said, "Two dongs way up."

09:07.256 --> 09:10.592
There was no mention of another bigger
celebrity in the document you faxed?

09:10.675 --> 09:13.345
I couldn't read it. My fax machine
cut it into little strips.

09:13.429 --> 09:16.390
-That sounds like a shredder.
-Well, I guess I shredded it to you.

09:16.474 --> 09:17.766
-[iPad chimes]
-I gotta deal with this.

09:17.849 --> 09:20.185
If I don't interact with this app
every 80 seconds,

09:20.269 --> 09:22.896
it charges my credit card five dollars.
Love you.

09:22.980 --> 09:24.398
[mumbling] Ehh... you, too.

09:24.482 --> 09:26.400
Could you get the base
a little less pale?

09:26.484 --> 09:29.153
-Hey, Daniel, good to see you.
-Always nice to meet a fan.

09:29.236 --> 09:33.324
-No, sorry, I'm not a, uh-- I'm an actor.
-Oh, good for you.

09:33.407 --> 09:35.700
It's a dreadful business
but hang in there.

09:35.826 --> 09:38.245
No, I already did hang in there.
I'm BoJack Horseman?

09:38.329 --> 09:39.538
We've actually met before.

09:39.621 --> 09:42.833
At Chris Martin's holiday party?
We stepped outside for a smoke?

09:42.916 --> 09:44.668
-To get away from Chris Martin?
-Huh.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.795
You opened up
about your fear of success?

09:46.878 --> 09:48.088
I gave you some advice?

09:48.172 --> 09:51.591
You said I was a true friend
and you would never forget me?

09:51.675 --> 09:54.261
And you said your name
was Chadwick Boseman?

09:54.345 --> 09:56.305
-BoJack Horseman.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

09:56.388 --> 09:59.517
When you're as famous as I am,
you meet so many people.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.268
Sorry, we need you guys back on set.

10:01.352 --> 10:04.188
You were the second hairdresser's
assistant on The Ellen Show

10:04.313 --> 10:06.148
about five years ago.
Veronica, right?

10:06.231 --> 10:09.026
-Yeah, that's right.
-How was your mother's party in the end?

10:09.109 --> 10:13.113
And we're back in five, four,
three, two...

10:13.197 --> 10:14.781
So you never say one, huh?

10:14.865 --> 10:17.909
-Welcome back, America.
-[man] We love you, Daniel.

10:18.035 --> 10:21.872
[laughs] So do I. So let's watch
our celebrities go... Audience?

10:21.955 --> 10:24.375
[all] Head to head!

10:24.458 --> 10:26.168
How could they possibly know that?

10:26.251 --> 10:28.420
-This is the first episode, right?
-[J.D. laughs]

10:28.504 --> 10:32.257
The puppets clap
when the puppetmaster pulls the strings.

10:32.341 --> 10:35.594
Hello. Serious,
Going-Places Todd at your service.

10:35.677 --> 10:38.763
Hey, look at you, all dressed up
for the Dipshit Awards.

10:38.847 --> 10:41.016
You know you're not allowed
in Hair and Makeup.

10:41.099 --> 10:43.935
-Are you wearing roller skates?
-I'm wearing Heelys.

10:44.019 --> 10:46.771
They're shoes with wheels,
for efficiency purposes.

10:46.855 --> 10:50.817
-Now I can be serious faster.
-You can also go nowhere faster.

10:50.901 --> 10:53.362
Seeing as I am a professional--

10:53.445 --> 10:55.406
No!

10:55.489 --> 10:57.324
-[buzzer sounds]
-Oh, BoJack.

10:57.449 --> 10:59.577
Another embarrassingly
wrong answer,

10:59.659 --> 11:03.830
bringing your score down
by 80 points and 12 dollars.

11:03.914 --> 11:05.999
Why are we playing
for both points and dollars?

11:06.083 --> 11:08.668
-Oh, tough break, B.J. Novak!
-My name is--

11:08.752 --> 11:10.546
Our next question is to Mr. Radcliffe.

11:10.629 --> 11:14.841
"What color comes from
the combination of blue and yellow?"

11:14.925 --> 11:16.134
I actually know this one.

11:16.218 --> 11:18.637
When I was growing up,
my neighbor was a painter.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.098
I remember visiting his flat
and watching him work.

11:21.181 --> 11:24.226
Sometimes he would mix together
blue paint with yellow paint

11:24.309 --> 11:26.144
and it made an entirely new color.

11:26.228 --> 11:28.855
And that man was Banksy.
And that color was green.

11:28.939 --> 11:31.108
-Final answer.
-Correct!

11:31.191 --> 11:33.151
You've earned
the chance to go for a spin

11:33.235 --> 11:35.529
in our Kia Sportage Cash Grab Booth.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.448
[audience cheering]

11:37.531 --> 11:39.324
Oh, splendid.

11:39.450 --> 11:42.744
And while Daniel's in the booth,
BoJack, you have an essay question.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.996
-What?
-You'll find a blue book on your podium.

11:45.080 --> 11:48.041
"To what extent was feudalism
a cause of the French Revolution?"

11:48.125 --> 11:49.709
-Wait, are you ser-- Oh!
-And go!

11:49.793 --> 11:51.878
While BoJack works,
let's check out the action

11:51.962 --> 11:54.673
-on our Kia Sportage Cash Grab Booth Cam.
-[audience cheers]

11:56.007 --> 11:57.717
-Hey, champ.
-What are you doing here?

11:57.801 --> 11:58.969
I'm trying to write an essay.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.720
I came to ask you how you were doing

12:00.804 --> 12:03.014
and then to tell you
you're not doing so well.

12:03.098 --> 12:04.724
Why am I getting
the hard questions,

12:04.808 --> 12:06.977
while Boy Wizard over there
just has to know colors

12:07.060 --> 12:08.979
and literally grab cash out of thin air?

12:09.187 --> 12:11.940
[Daniel laughs] A five! This is so easy!

12:12.023 --> 12:15.486
I think I might be able to help you out.
Let me tell you a story.

12:15.569 --> 12:17.488
The year was 2003

12:17.571 --> 12:20.865
and for some reason, everyone was
playing poker all of a sudden.

12:20.949 --> 12:25.412
A then-relevant Wilmer Valderrama
used to host a weekly how-do-you-do

12:25.537 --> 12:28.748
and all the stars
came out to show off their tricks.

12:28.832 --> 12:33.170
There was Lucy Lawless, Lucy Liu,
Lori Laughlin, Lisa Loeb,

12:33.253 --> 12:36.089
the dog from Frasier,
and at the head of the table?

12:36.173 --> 12:39.801
Big Money himself, Mr. Peanutbutter.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.219
Whoops. Woh-oh.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.347
I thought, "Here's a rube."

12:44.097 --> 12:44.931
[laughs]

12:45.182 --> 12:48.310
But Lady Luck had other plans.

12:48.393 --> 12:49.853
You know what,
I got an essay to write,

12:49.936 --> 12:52.690
so if this isn't about the precipitous
fall of the French ruling class--

12:52.731 --> 12:55.734
But then I saw, the kid had a tell.

12:58.111 --> 13:01.198
I feel like that story had a lot
of unnecessary details in it.

13:01.281 --> 13:04.702
Listen. You have to pay close attention,
it's subtle,

13:04.826 --> 13:10.207
but when he gets excited, his ears ever
so slightly flop up and give him away.

13:10.290 --> 13:13.669
Well, that's no surprise. Guy's been
flopping upwards his whole career.

13:13.752 --> 13:16.588
Mm-hm. Watch the ears.

13:17.172 --> 13:18.298
[horn blows]

13:18.507 --> 13:20.509
Time's up, Daniel.

13:20.592 --> 13:24.054
Whoa, looks like D to the R
to the Ad to the Cliffe

13:24.137 --> 13:27.098
just won 54,000 bonus dollars.

13:27.182 --> 13:31.061
And BoJack barely got beyond
his thesis statement.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.020
[audience laughing]

13:32.103 --> 13:34.565
[clears throat]
"A continent ravaged by war,

13:34.648 --> 13:37.401
coupled with the retreat
of the church from secular life..."

13:37.484 --> 13:39.444
-And then it just stops?
-[audience laughs]

13:39.528 --> 13:42.364
Oh, that's gonna cost
you some serious pesos.

13:42.447 --> 13:45.450
But first, it's time for
our Multiple Choice Buzz-In Round.

13:45.576 --> 13:47.202
A buzz-in round? All right.

13:47.285 --> 13:49.705
In is my favorite direction
in which to buzz.

13:49.788 --> 13:52.207
Tell me, "How many oak trees are needed

13:52.290 --> 13:56.795
to build an 18th century triple-decker
Royal Navy battle ship?

13:56.878 --> 14:00.298
A, 75? B, 1000?

14:00.382 --> 14:02.426
Or C, 3500?"

14:02.509 --> 14:04.553
C! 3500!

14:04.886 --> 14:06.722
-Um, correct.
-Uh, what?

14:06.805 --> 14:08.724
-Uh, wow. That's, uh...
-[mild applause]

14:08.807 --> 14:10.392
That's actually correct.

14:10.475 --> 14:13.937
How the hell did he know that? What else
does he know? Does he know things?

14:14.020 --> 14:14.938
Let's find out.

14:16.064 --> 14:20.026
Quantum tunneling.
King Magnus the Second.

14:20.110 --> 14:22.529
Miss Scarlet in the library
with the lead pipe.

14:22.613 --> 14:25.532
Sassafras. Butterscotch! Argyle.

14:25.616 --> 14:28.410
-Because seven eight nine.
-[buzzes]

14:28.535 --> 14:32.080
What an amazing run.
It looks like we've got a tied game.

14:32.163 --> 14:35.083
Which is an exciting surprise.

14:35.166 --> 14:38.044
-Goddamn it, throw to commercial.
-We'll be right back.

14:38.128 --> 14:40.338
[lively music playing over speakers]

14:40.547 --> 14:44.802
-Hey. Horshack. What's going on?
-What's going on is I'm kicking your ass.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.887
Yeah, you know, you're doing great,
but I'm supposed to win.

14:47.971 --> 14:50.557
That was the deal.
Plug my movie, win money for charity.

14:50.641 --> 14:52.643
Well, tell Charity she can kiss my ass.

14:52.726 --> 14:54.394
By the way,
your girlfriend has a stripper name.

14:54.478 --> 14:57.606
It's not my girlfriend, it's charity.

15:00.734 --> 15:03.737
BoJack, according to this app,
you're almost tied.

15:03.821 --> 15:06.698
Oh, you are tied, there's a lag.
Congratulations.

15:06.782 --> 15:08.450
Thanks. It was touch and go--

15:08.533 --> 15:09.909
But I'm a little concerned

15:10.034 --> 15:12.579
because it seems like
you might actually win,

15:12.663 --> 15:15.248
but everyone on the app
is really rooting for Daniel.

15:15.332 --> 15:16.416
People love him.

15:16.500 --> 15:20.587
I guess he was in some movie about a
potter or a Pottery Barn or something?

15:20.671 --> 15:23.882
-Are you asking me to throw the game?
-You don't care about this game.

15:23.965 --> 15:27.427
The only reason you're here is for me,
so maybe you could help me out?

15:27.511 --> 15:29.471
-[sighs] Okay.
-You know what?

15:29.554 --> 15:32.724
You're the best, no matter
what everybody on this app says.

15:32.808 --> 15:37.979
They say you're the worst. Especially
Queefburglar69. He's their leader.

15:38.188 --> 15:39.898
[audience cheering]

15:40.148 --> 15:44.569
And we're back. Contestants, I've got
a history question for both of you.

15:44.653 --> 15:50.408
"You may or may not be familiar with a
famous racehorse named Secretariat.

15:50.534 --> 15:53.537
In what year did Secretariat
win the Triple Crown?"

15:53.620 --> 15:54.788
-[buzzer sounds]
-BoJack.

15:54.872 --> 15:56.373
Piece of cake.

15:56.581 --> 15:58.124
Hmm?

15:58.375 --> 15:59.417
[sighs]

15:59.501 --> 16:01.961
Um, 1492?

16:02.045 --> 16:04.673
-[audience and Daniel laughing]
-What? No, not even close.

16:04.756 --> 16:07.676
BoJack, aren't you in a movie
about Secretariat?

16:07.759 --> 16:11.262
-How could you not know that?
-Let's just move on.

16:11.346 --> 16:13.306
Maybe instead,
he should be in a movie

16:13.390 --> 16:16.810
about a guy who doesn't know
anything about Secretariat. [laughs]

16:16.894 --> 16:18.395
That would not be a good movie.

16:18.478 --> 16:21.690
I mean, more like Secre-terrible.

16:21.773 --> 16:24.609
Damn, Bojangles, you got served.

16:24.693 --> 16:28.405
Do you know anything about Secretariat?
You know he was a horse, right?

16:28.488 --> 16:30.782
Oh, wait, did I just spoil it for you?

16:30.866 --> 16:33.827
No wonder my wife
had to write your book for you.

16:33.952 --> 16:38.039
Hey, yeah, you know, while we're talking
about your wife, I've got a question.

16:38.122 --> 16:41.209
How come your wife flew
all the way to war-torn Cordovia

16:41.292 --> 16:42.669
just to get away from you?

16:42.878 --> 16:43.712
[people murmuring]

16:43.795 --> 16:46.130
That's not what happened.
She went to help people.

16:46.214 --> 16:49.634
Or maybe she went to help herself
get away from her awful marriage.

16:49.843 --> 16:50.719
[audience gasping]

16:50.928 --> 16:54.723
-Oh, was that too far?
-Oh-ho, you want to get into things?

16:54.806 --> 16:57.141
-Well, I mean--
-No, no, no, let's get into things.

16:57.225 --> 17:01.104
Let's get real.
Everybody, BoJack wants to get real.

17:01.229 --> 17:05.108
Cancel the Bubble Round.
Because we're getting real.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.651
[production assistant sighs]

17:06.859 --> 17:08.152
Should we cut to commercial?

17:08.236 --> 17:10.320
Would Homer cut away
from Odysseus's journey

17:10.405 --> 17:13.366
just as he was being enticed
by the sirens' song?

17:13.450 --> 17:14.952
No?

17:15.076 --> 17:16.493
Well, there you are.

17:16.578 --> 17:19.623
Things are getting real out here.
Really real.

17:19.705 --> 17:22.416
Really, really, really real!

17:22.917 --> 17:24.377
[audience member clears throat]

17:24.586 --> 17:26.838
-Uh, I'm not sure where you're going--
-Oh, no?

17:26.922 --> 17:28.840
You knew
where you were going with my wife

17:28.924 --> 17:31.175
that time you pulled over
by the side of the road.

17:31.259 --> 17:33.553
-You know, a week before we got married?
-Uh...

17:33.637 --> 17:35.722
You want to talk about that, BoJack?

17:35.806 --> 17:40.727
You want to talk about the time when you,
my "good friend," kissed my wife?

17:40.811 --> 17:42.103
-No!
-Yes.

17:42.186 --> 17:43.647
Did something
exciting just happen?

17:43.730 --> 17:47.275
Because people on the app are,
and I quote, "losing their tits."

17:47.358 --> 17:50.487
Oh, no, no, I've stumbled on to
a cancer support message board.

17:50.570 --> 17:51.822
Okay, how do I...?

17:51.905 --> 17:53.197
How did you know about that?

17:53.281 --> 17:56.034
Well, there are roadside cameras
all along the PCH,

17:56.159 --> 17:58.119
I have a few friends
in the highway patrol,

17:58.202 --> 18:00.330
and she told me, of course! We're married!

18:00.413 --> 18:03.625
Wait, so you've known all this time?

18:03.708 --> 18:06.628
Now this is television. Turn on the rain.

18:06.711 --> 18:09.130
Um, don't you think
you're pushing them too far?

18:09.213 --> 18:12.592
I'll tell you when it's too far.
This is my art, goddamn it.

18:12.676 --> 18:17.597
I'm J. goddamn D.
goddamn Salinger, and I want rain!

18:17.889 --> 18:19.641
[thunder rumbling]

18:20.224 --> 18:23.020
All I ever wanted was to be your friend.

18:23.102 --> 18:26.397
And you treat me like a big joke.

18:26.481 --> 18:28.817
You think I don't notice?
Why don't you like me?

18:28.900 --> 18:31.028
-Mr. Peanutbutter--
-No, tell me.

18:31.110 --> 18:34.155
-Because... I'm jealous.
-Oh.

18:34.238 --> 18:37.492
-Of what? Diane?
-No.

18:37.575 --> 18:40.787
Of everything.
Everything comes so easy for you.

18:40.912 --> 18:42.372
Oh, and it doesn't for you?

18:42.455 --> 18:45.625
You're a millionaire movie star
with a girlfriend who loves you,

18:45.709 --> 18:49.420
acting in your dream movie.
What more do you want?

18:49.504 --> 18:52.757
What else could
the universe possibly owe you?

18:52.841 --> 18:56.678
I want to feel good about myself.

18:56.761 --> 19:00.306
The way you do.
And I don't know how.

19:00.390 --> 19:01.933
I don't know if I can.

19:02.017 --> 19:05.186
Whoa, guys, this is getting
a little heavy, don't we think?

19:05.269 --> 19:07.438
I'm sorry, Mr. Peanutbutter.

19:07.605 --> 19:09.733
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

19:09.941 --> 19:14.779
Wow, um, I don't know
if I can forgive you.

19:14.863 --> 19:18.241
But I guess we'll find out
right after this break.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.492
[audience cheering]

19:19.701 --> 19:22.370
-Damn.
-Shut up.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.622
[all cheering]

19:24.956 --> 19:28.376
I knew it. I knew this show would
bring us to the heights of human drama

19:28.459 --> 19:30.837
more powerfully than literature
ever dreamed.

19:30.921 --> 19:34.091
Now somebody go out and get me
a Red Bull and a banana fish sandwich.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.552
On it. It's a perfect day for a Red Bull.

19:37.635 --> 19:38.845
Whoa-oh!

19:39.054 --> 19:41.514
-Mr. Peanutbutter!
-Oh, hey Wanda.

19:41.598 --> 19:44.726
I'm only half paying attention
to whatever you two are arguing about

19:44.809 --> 19:47.645
but it's killer.
Now all we need is a happy ending.

19:47.729 --> 19:50.774
I don't think we can just resolve
everything cleanly in a half-hour.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.609
Uh, this is network television.

19:52.692 --> 19:56.905
So resolving everything cleanly
in a half-hour is kind of what we do.

19:56.988 --> 19:59.991
You want to host a game show where
everyone feels bad at the end?

20:00.075 --> 20:03.661
You can get in your little car, drive to
Santa Monica and pitch it to AMC.

20:03.787 --> 20:06.497
But these people want resolution, okay?

20:06.581 --> 20:10.668
So you get your little butt back
on that stage and you resolve.

20:11.002 --> 20:13.296
-Uh...
-[audience applauding]

20:13.504 --> 20:15.132
And we're back.

20:15.214 --> 20:18.551
You know, I did some thinking
over the break. BoJack--

20:18.843 --> 20:20.511
-[electricity powers down]
-[audience gasps]

20:20.595 --> 20:21.846
-What's going on?
-Oh, my God.

20:21.930 --> 20:23.556
No! No! What's happening?

20:23.848 --> 20:25.183
-[all chattering]
-Oh.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.353
[electricity powers up]

20:29.896 --> 20:33.357
Someone unplugged the main power line
and plugged in a George Foreman Grill.

20:33.441 --> 20:36.527
Panini time. Hey, who unplugged--

20:36.611 --> 20:39.280
Todd! Goddamnit, step aside!

20:39.363 --> 20:42.450
Mia, good work.
You saved the show.

20:42.533 --> 20:45.829
You earned my respect... and this pen.

20:46.537 --> 20:48.706
-Oh, thank you.
-[all cheering]

20:49.499 --> 20:50.959
Aww.

20:51.209 --> 20:54.921
Oh, are we back? We're back!
Live television, folks.

20:55.005 --> 20:58.008
You know, during the break,
my producers told me

20:58.091 --> 21:00.885
I had to forgive BoJack
live on the air.

21:00.969 --> 21:02.179
[audience booing]

21:02.261 --> 21:04.097
But I'm my own dog.

21:04.181 --> 21:06.808
And as my own dog, I decided

21:06.891 --> 21:10.728
to forgive BoJack live on the air!
Bring it in, buddy!

21:10.812 --> 21:11.855
-What?
-Really?

21:11.938 --> 21:14.398
Mr. Peanutbutter,
I applaud your forgiving nature,

21:14.482 --> 21:17.027
but this guy kissed your wife.

21:17.110 --> 21:19.196
Wait, BoJack kissed Diane?

21:19.278 --> 21:23.574
The only way to even the score
is if you get to kiss him.

21:23.658 --> 21:26.161
-Wait, what?
-You're right, it makes perfect sense.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.996
-Yeah, absolutely.
-No, it doesn't.

21:28.079 --> 21:30.581
That way Diane and I will have
had the same experience.

21:30.665 --> 21:32.917
It's the only way we can move past this.

21:33.001 --> 21:33.835
[sighs]

21:33.918 --> 21:36.087
Well, if it helps us move past this,
I guess...

21:36.171 --> 21:40.717
[Daniel and audience] Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

21:40.800 --> 21:43.094
[J.D.] Cue the Kiss Cam.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.304
[love song playing over speakers]

21:48.725 --> 21:52.687
Oh, if only I'd had a Kiss Cam
for Catcher In The Rye.

21:52.770 --> 21:56.066
Well, just one more regret
on a long list of many.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.987
Todd, there you are. You're missing
a pretty big moment out there.

22:01.071 --> 22:06.367
I don't care. You said it yourself.
Without that pen, I'm totally worthless.

22:06.450 --> 22:09.954
Not for nothing, but you were worthless
before you didn't get the pen.

22:10.080 --> 22:16.335
I really tried this time. I guess
I'll never really amount to anything.

22:16.419 --> 22:20.339
Well, maybe you just need
someone to believe in you.

22:20.423 --> 22:24.010
Wow, no one's ever
fallen for that!

22:24.094 --> 22:26.596
-What?
-You're so stupid!

22:26.679 --> 22:30.308
You had the pen
and you just gave it to me?!

22:30.391 --> 22:32.769
Oh, I can't believe that worked.

22:32.852 --> 22:36.231
Oh, my God, look at your stupid face.

22:36.314 --> 22:37.941
The pen is just a symbol.
It doesn't--

22:38.024 --> 22:41.444
Yeah, said the girl
who doesn't have a pen right now.

22:41.527 --> 22:45.615
Unbelievable. You are the most annoying,
immature, aggravating,

22:45.698 --> 22:47.575
irritating, crazy-making...

22:47.658 --> 22:51.121
Oh, she was mad, all right. But kids?

22:51.246 --> 22:54.999
That's the story of
how I met... this pen.

22:55.208 --> 22:56.251
[laughs]

22:56.334 --> 22:59.129
Hey, get out of Hair and Makeup
and give me back my pen!

22:59.212 --> 23:02.381
I got your pen.
That means you respect me.

23:02.465 --> 23:05.093
-No it does not.
-Viva Todd-foolery!

23:05.176 --> 23:06.886
Suck a dick, dumbshits.

23:06.970 --> 23:08.763
-Hey! Hey, hey!
-[blows raspberry]

23:08.972 --> 23:11.724
-[lively music playing over speakers]
-[audience cheering]

23:11.808 --> 23:14.894
Well, that stern but supple kiss
puts you over the top.

23:14.978 --> 23:17.438
BoJack Horseman is tonight's winner.

23:17.647 --> 23:18.940
[dog howls]

23:19.149 --> 23:21.400
-Well played, Jock-jam Door-slam.
-[groans]

23:21.484 --> 23:24.612
You've earned $500,000 for charity.

23:24.695 --> 23:29.575
You can walk away right now
or, and remember, this is for charity,

23:29.659 --> 23:32.578
you can risk it all in
our Double or Nothing round.

23:32.829 --> 23:34.956
[audience clamoring]

23:35.165 --> 23:36.833
I wanna risk it all!

23:36.916 --> 23:40.170
All right. Now that's $500,000.

23:40.253 --> 23:42.546
If you get this question right,
you double that,

23:42.630 --> 23:44.423
a million dollars for charity.

23:44.507 --> 23:46.759
But if you get it wrong,
the charity gets nothing

23:46.843 --> 23:51.555
and all the money will be set on fire
live here on our studio soundstage.

23:51.639 --> 23:54.225
BoJack, for all the marbles:

23:54.309 --> 23:57.103
"Which famous actor
played the titular role

23:57.187 --> 24:00.731
in the popular Harry Potter
film franchise?"

24:00.940 --> 24:02.984
-[audience] Oh.
-Huh.

24:03.067 --> 24:05.486
Yeah. I don't know.

24:05.569 --> 24:08.323
When you're as famous as I am,
you meet so many people,

24:08.406 --> 24:10.574
it's impossible to remember them all.

24:10.658 --> 24:13.036
Okay, I get what you're doing. Very funny.

24:13.161 --> 24:16.331
Yeah. Oh, what is that guy's name?

24:16.414 --> 24:18.833
You know, it's on the tip of my tongue?

24:18.916 --> 24:21.294
Are you serious right now?
Dude, this is for charity.

24:21.378 --> 24:24.047
-BoJack, we need an answer.
-Yeah, I don't know.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.882
Gosh, I wanna say...

24:28.968 --> 24:30.845
-Elijah Wood?
-What?
