WEBVTT

01:09.319 --> 01:13.073
Fuck your armband count, bitch.
I’m ‘bout to get out!

01:18.662 --> 01:20.581
When I get out, the first thing...

01:22.082 --> 01:23.250
What’d the officer say?

01:24.418 --> 01:25.252
You know.

01:26.211 --> 01:28.839
I’mma get fucked up
when I get out, shorty.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.966
I’m gonna be lit as fuck when I get out...

01:33.677 --> 01:35.053
I love smoking weed.

01:35.470 --> 01:39.433
I just always smoke that shit in my car,
and that’s what fucks me up.

01:42.394 --> 01:45.355
Gwinnett is just so hot,
they’ll lock you up for anything.

01:47.691 --> 01:50.277
<i>You gon’ be in here doin’ some time
for some bullshit.</i>

01:51.320 --> 01:52.779
You gonna be sad when I leave?

01:52.863 --> 01:55.073
I’ll call you, though.
I’m going to call you.

01:55.157 --> 01:58.201
You have to come to the east side,
‘cause I’m not comin’ nowhere in Gwinnett.

01:58.327 --> 02:01.121
Like, at all. Like, I’m not tryin’
to get locked back up.

02:03.498 --> 02:04.708
Um, this year...

02:05.208 --> 02:07.002
I was driving, got stopped in Gwinnett,

02:07.085 --> 02:11.131
and they found, like, a little bit
of marijuana residue in my, um, car,

02:11.214 --> 02:13.383
and they just gave me a ticket,
less than an ounce.

02:14.009 --> 02:17.471
'Cause I went to court for that, and
whatever, and they put me on probation.

02:17.554 --> 02:20.849
And then, um, a couple months later, um,

02:20.932 --> 02:23.935
I got another charge of 0,5
of marijuana in my car.

02:25.646 --> 02:26.772
The judge seen it.

02:26.855 --> 02:29.691
He seen everything
and he was like, "180 days."

02:30.734 --> 02:32.194
So, that's how I'm here.

02:34.112 --> 02:37.366
When I first got into
the actual population of jail,

02:37.449 --> 02:40.410
I was like, ain’t no way in hell
these niggas finna institutionalize me.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.454
That shit's dead as fuck,
you know what I’m sayin’?

02:42.537 --> 02:45.082
It became like a game to me,
you know what I’m sayin’?

02:45.165 --> 02:47.292
I’m always gon’ win at the end.

02:47.376 --> 02:49.252
Like, you cannot get the best of me.

02:49.336 --> 02:50.587
My freedom is in here.

02:51.046 --> 02:52.464
You want some of this coffee?

02:52.547 --> 02:55.467
You know I use Sweet’N Low
because I’m trying to watch my figure.

02:55.550 --> 02:58.178
Girl, you look beautiful
how you is, shorty.

02:58.261 --> 03:00.055
No, you a little sexy lil’ chocolate.

03:00.138 --> 03:01.973
If you don’t get yo' ass...

03:05.519 --> 03:06.853
You all right, nigga.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.439
I know. I’m more than all right.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.735
I’m smooth wit'...
I'm smooth wit' the shit. Yeah.

03:14.444 --> 03:18.240
I’m a playa, shorty, you feel me?
I am smooth as hell wit’ the shit.

03:19.241 --> 03:20.075
What's up, baby?

03:20.617 --> 03:21.576
I know you love me.

03:24.496 --> 03:25.622
You want autograph?

03:27.124 --> 03:27.999
What's up?

03:30.210 --> 03:33.880
Jail is not what I thought it was gon’ be.
Like, this shit was low-key lit as fuck.

03:34.589 --> 03:35.465
Yo, where the ho's at?

03:37.509 --> 03:38.427
Ooh!

03:38.510 --> 03:39.386
Indian.

03:39.970 --> 03:41.179
<i>Hola, mami.</i>

03:41.680 --> 03:42.597
<i>¿Cómo estás?</i>

03:43.098 --> 03:47.144
Lotta girls. Lotta, lotta girls. And there
was just the thrill of getting caught.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.104
Like, that shit was funny as fuck.

03:51.148 --> 03:53.358
You wanna keep it down, Lucas.

03:55.527 --> 03:56.862
Who, me? All right.

03:56.945 --> 03:57.779
Getting out?

03:57.863 --> 03:58.947
Yeah, I’m getting out.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.574
I’ll be drunk as hell
when I go to church.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.744
Really?
You starting out like that?

04:03.827 --> 04:06.163
Look, we might go
just get a drink together one day.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.415
I’m serious. Be yourself.

04:08.498 --> 04:12.043
All right? The minute I feel like
you’re disruptive, it's over.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.380
That bitch so fine. Jesus Christ.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.048
That bitch.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.136
What's that now?

04:21.219 --> 04:23.138
I don’t know, but that bitch is so fine.

04:23.972 --> 04:26.933
I might marry that bitch.
I don’t even fuck with the police.

04:27.225 --> 04:28.393
But, shit...

04:28.727 --> 04:31.897
She already fine as fuck, but then
her attitude...

05:08.600 --> 05:10.310
This looks like Dexter’s laboratory.

05:10.393 --> 05:12.354
That's right, don’t worry about that.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.488
You've been here before?

05:21.571 --> 05:24.491
- No. This is Gwinnett County, right?
- Yes. You’ve never been here before?

05:24.574 --> 05:27.494
Do you have any tattoos? No?
All right, turn around face the wall.

05:27.786 --> 05:29.871
Do you have anything
that’ll stick me or hurt me?

05:29.955 --> 05:31.915
No. Except for these bracelets.

05:32.666 --> 05:36.545
- And I’m going commando, too, just so...
- I don’t plan on pulling your pants off.

05:38.088 --> 05:41.591
I wanna give a shout-out
to all my homies and friends.

05:44.511 --> 05:47.889
Definitely not my daughter,
because this is very embarrassing.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.268
But, to my boyfriend, it’s so over.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.270
Turn around and face me.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.064
Take your shoes off, hand them to me.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.734
My boyfriend punched me
in the eye and in the mouth.

05:59.943 --> 06:02.612
And I got locked up.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.907
I need your left hand, first two fingers,
place it on the green screen.

06:05.991 --> 06:08.159
I kicked him back, and I hit him back.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.746
Police didn’t see what he did to me.

06:11.830 --> 06:14.291
They just saw me trying to defend myself.

06:16.418 --> 06:20.964
I’ll always love him. He was my boyfriend
since I was 18 years old. But...

06:23.800 --> 06:25.343
not after this.

06:27.304 --> 06:28.680
Can I file charges?

06:29.639 --> 06:30.599
You can.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.435
- You just have to...
- I’d like to do that.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.687
You’ll just have to wait
till you’re not here anymore.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.815
<i>I feel betrayed, I feel abandoned.</i>

06:38.940 --> 06:42.444
<i>I feel pissed off. I was still drunk,
and he done had me locked up.</i>

06:43.320 --> 06:44.779
<i>I don't think that that's fair.</i>

06:46.781 --> 06:49.492
Anyway, I’m single. So, who’s available?

06:51.828 --> 06:53.038
Arms over your head like this.

06:54.956 --> 06:55.790
Strike a pose.

06:55.874 --> 06:56.750
Hey, have a seat.

06:58.835 --> 07:01.504
Hey, you gotta make kicks
whenever you can.

07:03.214 --> 07:05.759
I got lemons,
I’m makin’ lemonade.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.404
Look at you.

07:26.738 --> 07:28.365
You're goin' home.

07:29.741 --> 07:30.825
Can’t wait.

07:34.496 --> 07:37.666
So ready to look back fuckin’ gorgeous.

07:38.708 --> 07:42.963
The hair on my face, my fuckin’ haircut...
This shit is just depressing.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.886
Thank God
I’m gettin’ the fuck out of here.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.558
I've been here for 30 days.

07:57.394 --> 07:59.396
It’s had more downs than it’s had its ups.

08:02.273 --> 08:05.485
I’m going home to Charlotte, North
Carolina, and I’m not looking back.

08:06.945 --> 08:10.615
It was actually last year
that I had got in trouble with the law.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.200
Um...

08:13.451 --> 08:15.453
October 15th, my birthday.

08:16.830 --> 08:20.500
My friends, they were just like,
“Come outta town with us.”

08:21.334 --> 08:24.462
We had got pulled over,
and the police officer...

08:25.422 --> 08:27.799
smelled weed in the car.
I tried to eat it.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.802
I couldn’t find it in time.

08:30.885 --> 08:33.513
And that’s how my probation has started.

08:34.431 --> 08:38.101
I failed a drug screening and, um...

08:38.768 --> 08:39.769
I'm here.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.858
<i>I’m writing my last day here, I...</i>

08:45.442 --> 08:47.610
<i>I never thought this day would happen.</i>

08:48.111 --> 08:49.446
<i>It seemed so damn far.</i>

08:50.030 --> 08:53.116
Don’t come back to Gwinnett
County when you get up outta here, bro.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.160
Trust me, I’m never looking back.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.998
The day that they sentenced me,
I was in disbelief.

09:00.540 --> 09:04.169
But I’ve dealt with so many hardships,
I was just like, all right, well...

09:06.212 --> 09:07.505
this is a piece of cake.

09:09.924 --> 09:12.093
But I knew it wasn’t gonna be
a piece of cake.

09:12.677 --> 09:14.679
What you gon' do
on your first day out?

09:16.639 --> 09:19.142
- First day out?
- I’m gonna get my hair cut.

09:19.768 --> 09:23.813
I’m going to hug and kiss my family,

09:23.897 --> 09:25.774
and... and...

09:29.152 --> 09:31.404
I kinda wanna say I wanna go shopping.

09:32.113 --> 09:34.824
You thinking about shopping,
but you ain’t thinking about no pussy?

09:34.908 --> 09:37.911
I mean, ‘cause I wanna be
on a positive mind. That ain’t...

09:37.994 --> 09:39.037
But that is positive.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.873
That is positive. That’s how
you release the stress you have!

09:41.956 --> 09:44.834
- That’s a get outta jail tradition.
- No.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.879
The first stop is poon-poon,
ninety, ninety, ninety.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.006
- What the fuck you mean?
- Poon-poon.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.550
That’s the first thing.
I don’t care about seeing no niggas.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.219
Wow!

09:56.596 --> 09:58.348
<i>A lot of the people here...</i>

09:59.140 --> 10:00.475
they’re very judgmental.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.604
People think that they could say
anything to me.

10:04.687 --> 10:07.524
That I won’t stand up for myself.

10:07.607 --> 10:11.236
I’ve had numerous occasions where
I thought I was gonna have to fight.

10:12.195 --> 10:15.031
- You was talking shit about me.
- When was I talking shit?

10:15.115 --> 10:16.699
I heard it and I seen it.

10:17.367 --> 10:20.370
It’s like, ol’ feminine-ass
dirty nigga, some shit.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.080
You said that up
underneath your breath.

10:22.831 --> 10:25.625
I just don’t have that much respect
for niggas that

10:25.708 --> 10:27.836
try to make me look bad
in front of other niggas.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.380
You wouldn't pat me
in the street?

10:30.463 --> 10:32.257
If I hadn’t been in here
for 30 days,

10:32.841 --> 10:35.009
we would've been thumped,
that's on everything.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.220
- We would've been thumping?
- We would've been thumped.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.599
Who's the help? Who's the help?

10:41.683 --> 10:44.894
He look like he throw shit like this.
He would have just rushed at me.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.020
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

10:46.104 --> 10:47.021
Nah.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.692
People thought
that they could just try me,

10:50.775 --> 10:53.778
I guess because I have,
like, a soft voice, or whatever.

10:55.321 --> 11:01.077
I just had to get over it. Like, I had
to... get over, you know, a lot of things

11:01.161 --> 11:03.121
that I couldn’t control or change.

11:08.501 --> 11:11.588
That’s why I’m so ready to get
the fuck out of this motherfuckin’ jail.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.966
These niggas is so lucky I have learned
my lesson. I have changed.

11:15.049 --> 11:18.344
If not, I would have been in a box, and I
wouldn’t have thought motherfuckin' twice.

11:20.054 --> 11:24.017
I gotta hurry and get the fuck outta here,
‘cause I’mma really pap a nigga out.

11:25.935 --> 11:29.063
I’m glad I just
really controlled my emotions.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.234
I didn’t wanna mess up my goals
and my dreams,

11:33.318 --> 11:35.028
because I am a musician.

11:35.111 --> 11:36.696
I never forget that.

12:20.531 --> 12:22.575
Yeah, can you, like, go all the way up?

12:22.659 --> 12:24.452
- Uh-uh.
- Excuse me.

12:24.702 --> 12:27.538
Some of us ain’t bathed in three days.
We don’t need to be doing that.

12:27.622 --> 12:31.584
I was a superstar. I used to go to, like,
this famous school in New York,

12:31.668 --> 12:33.378
called Dance Studio of Harlem,

12:33.753 --> 12:35.630
and I had a scholarship
for, like, 10 years.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.674
Like, a full-blown scholarship.

12:38.216 --> 12:39.384
‘Cause I was so good at it.

12:42.095 --> 12:46.015
You know what,
before this year came, I was...

12:46.224 --> 12:48.059
Oh, my God. Oh, my God...

12:49.852 --> 12:51.771
Oh, my gosh!

12:53.648 --> 12:56.734
<i>Good Morning America</i> reporting...
I don’t even know what jail I’m in,

12:56.818 --> 12:59.320
so I can’t even do my proper
morning introductions.

13:00.822 --> 13:01.656
Where are we?

13:01.739 --> 13:03.116
You’re not sure where you are?

13:03.199 --> 13:05.243
Oh, no, I’m in Gwinnett, yeah.

13:05.326 --> 13:08.037
That’s the name of it.
I’m in Gwinnett County.

13:08.913 --> 13:10.123
I believe, yes.

13:11.249 --> 13:12.292
Um, so...

13:12.375 --> 13:15.545
I guess this is your first time in jail?

13:15.628 --> 13:16.879
In Georgia.

13:17.797 --> 13:21.634
You know, unfortunately,
third time’s a charm.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.553
Look at camera one right here.

13:25.722 --> 13:26.848
When you get in here...

13:29.600 --> 13:30.560
it sucks.

13:31.561 --> 13:32.979
That’s my lucky dollar.

13:34.188 --> 13:37.191
The food here is disgusting.
My baloney fell on the floor right now.

13:37.275 --> 13:38.985
But I picked it up right away.

13:39.068 --> 13:41.529
I haven’t taken a shower since Friday.

13:41.612 --> 13:44.157
They don’t even give bitches
toothbrushes or soap. Damn.

13:44.240 --> 13:48.369
I don’t even got a scrunchie no more. I
had to make a scrunchie. Like, it’s awful.

13:50.413 --> 13:54.334
I was doing ballet from the ages
of, like, three to, like, 13.

13:54.417 --> 13:55.293
Yeah!

13:55.376 --> 13:59.756
I took, like, hip-hop classes
from, like, 13 to, like, 16.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.175
And then, like, at 17,
I started stripping.

14:02.258 --> 14:05.136
- You started exotic dancing.
- I started dancing, yes.

14:08.056 --> 14:10.767
At the age of 16,
I was kicked out of my house.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.144
My mom told me
to pack my stuff and leave.

14:13.895 --> 14:16.731
Now I’m 16 years old, in the street,

14:16.814 --> 14:20.777
four big-ass bookbags
with three dollars in my pocket.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.946
My father told me to figure it out.
I’m 16 years old.

14:24.030 --> 14:26.991
You know what I had to do?
I had to figure it the fuck out.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.995
One of my friends
gave me an opportunity.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.955
You wanna cash some checks?

14:33.456 --> 14:36.125
That’s the life
that I feel like I had to take.

14:36.209 --> 14:39.420
‘Cause it’s like, if I don’t feed myself,
who’s gonna feed me?

14:40.046 --> 14:41.881
I’m not gonna lie,
when I was in high school,

14:41.964 --> 14:44.342
my friends used to steal,
and I ain’t steal. I’m like...

14:44.425 --> 14:46.094
These bitches gon’ get caught,
I’mma get...

14:46.177 --> 14:48.221
I was bad as hell.

14:49.097 --> 14:51.349
I’ve been in a lot
of bad situations

14:51.432 --> 14:54.185
and I had did everything I can

14:54.268 --> 14:57.980
to get out of them
in the most positive way that I could.

15:00.817 --> 15:02.610
I’m a consistent fraud offender.

15:02.735 --> 15:06.239
The first time I was incarcerated,
I was in jail in Boston.

15:06.322 --> 15:08.491
I did about 47 days.

15:09.283 --> 15:12.870
And maybe I should have learned
my lesson from there,

15:12.954 --> 15:16.207
but clearly I didn’t,
because I got arrested last year...

15:16.958 --> 15:20.545
um, in New Jersey, as well.
I travel a lot.

15:22.505 --> 15:23.923
That’s how I ended up in Georgia.

15:25.299 --> 15:26.676
When they arrested me,

15:26.759 --> 15:29.971
I was attempting to purchase a cellphone
in somebody else’s name.

15:30.805 --> 15:31.681
And now I’m here.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.899
- I don't even have a bond.
- Why?

15:41.983 --> 15:44.068
‘Cause my crime was so severe.

15:44.569 --> 15:47.238
For the inmate, there might be charges
that they don’t have a bond.

15:47.321 --> 15:50.575
So, they would be told, at this point,
you can’t get outta jail.

15:50.950 --> 15:54.162
This is where you’re gonna be
until you go in front of a judge

15:54.245 --> 15:55.538
and possibly get a bond.

15:57.081 --> 15:59.917
I think I see a judge later.
I know I’m a flight risk.

16:00.001 --> 16:02.295
I’m hoping that maybe I can get a bond.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.756
All I have is patience in here.

16:05.840 --> 16:08.217
‘Cause that’s all you have to have,
is patience,

16:08.301 --> 16:11.721
because you’re not on your time no more.
Now I’m on the state’s time.

16:18.227 --> 16:21.689
<i>To be honest, if I was sober I probably
wouldn’t have punched my boyfriend out.</i>

16:21.772 --> 16:23.858
<i>I’m gonna have to calm down my drinking.</i>

16:24.775 --> 16:26.819
<i>I think I’m gonna just stick
to the weekends.</i>

16:26.903 --> 16:29.197
Damn, who has a brush?

16:29.989 --> 16:32.825
They should let you at least
brush your hair

16:32.909 --> 16:35.620
before they done fuckin’ lock ya up.

16:35.703 --> 16:38.122
Give you some lipstick, shit? No.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.791
Look at this mugshot!

16:42.126 --> 16:43.920
This is ridiculous!

16:44.420 --> 16:46.339
Damn, somebody done took a shit.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.257
Oh, my God.

16:48.966 --> 16:50.927
Damn it, I’m goin’ bald.

16:51.552 --> 16:55.181
Listen, I’m gonna be funny as shit
until my buzz runs out.

16:55.264 --> 16:56.974
Let’s do a twerk show.

17:01.020 --> 17:04.857
Chavez. Mendez. Kessler. Amaar.

17:05.566 --> 17:06.776
McEntire.

17:10.445 --> 17:13.574
My boyfriend, he was my high school
sweetheart, when I was 18,

17:13.657 --> 17:16.077
and I rue the day I ever met him.

17:18.663 --> 17:21.665
The police has been out numerous times
for him beating me up.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.546
And I’m sitting here locked up.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.550
Why in the world
are they sending me to jail?

17:31.592 --> 17:32.552
Ma’am?

17:36.389 --> 17:39.141
Stand in that yellow square.
Don’t lean on the counter, okay?

17:42.311 --> 17:43.646
These are your charges, okay?

17:44.230 --> 17:46.190
You’re being charged
with a simple battery charge,

17:46.274 --> 17:49.277
and you also have a charge
of false report of a crime.

17:49.777 --> 17:52.530
Your bond is $2,600 dollars total, okay?

17:52.905 --> 17:56.534
What will happen
if I cannot get bonded out?

17:56.617 --> 18:00.037
You will stay here and you go to
first appearance court the next day.

18:00.121 --> 18:01.539
- All right?
- Okay.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.167
It just sucks.

18:05.418 --> 18:09.088
One of my charges is
a false claim of a crime.

18:09.171 --> 18:13.092
That’s not true. I called the police.
It was because we were both fighting.

18:14.135 --> 18:16.554
So, how long does it take you
to go to court

18:16.637 --> 18:19.181
and how many, like,
how long could I be sittin’ here?

18:19.765 --> 18:21.517
I’ve been here 45 days.

18:22.226 --> 18:26.105
What? You’ve been here 45 days?
Oh, son of a bitch.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.566
<i>I’m depending on my boyfriend
for the money,</i>

18:28.649 --> 18:31.444
<i>but I’m just wonderin’, like,
is he even tryin’ to get me out?</i>

18:32.361 --> 18:33.195
<i>Hey.</i>

18:33.279 --> 18:35.239
Listen here, fuckin’ asshole.

18:35.698 --> 18:39.160
You need to get me the fuck outta jail.
This is ridiculous.

19:08.898 --> 19:11.984
Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my gosh.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.445
I’m actually going the fuck home.

19:15.446 --> 19:17.990
Who woulda fuckin’ thought that
this fuckin’ day would come?

19:19.241 --> 19:22.286
<i>Like, the shit
that was goin’ on in my mind...</i>

19:22.703 --> 19:25.289
<i>I was writing letters to myself.</i>

19:27.166 --> 19:29.377
<i>Tuesday, July 11th.</i>

19:29.460 --> 19:34.173
<i>"Listen, Keith, what did you learn?
Stop getting angry,</i>

19:34.256 --> 19:36.592
<i>never let anyone tell me
how to live my life,</i>

19:36.676 --> 19:38.260
<i>and stack that bread."</i>

19:41.138 --> 19:45.184
People used to always try to,
like, tell me who I should be.

19:47.812 --> 19:51.357
Oh, put some more bass
in your voice, or...

19:52.358 --> 19:54.193
or be more masculine.

19:54.777 --> 19:58.948
And that’s when I was like,
"No. I’m not gonna live my life

19:59.031 --> 20:02.618
under the next person’s expectations
of what I should be,

20:02.702 --> 20:05.079
or how I should sound or anything.

20:05.162 --> 20:07.790
I’m gonna live my life
the way that I want to.

20:08.499 --> 20:12.128
And I actually like my voice,
and I grew to love my voice.

20:28.102 --> 20:29.520
Before I got locked up,

20:29.603 --> 20:32.648
I was Miss Popular, right?
I had everything in college.

20:32.732 --> 20:37.153
Like, I got a car, a job.
I was living the life.

20:37.737 --> 20:41.157
Look at me now. I’m in jail right now.
I'm knocked down. I don’t have no job.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.577
I’m not in school right now.
Failed all my finals.

20:44.660 --> 20:49.874
That shit crazy, just how everything
can just turn around so fast.

20:50.416 --> 20:53.461
Fuck, bro. Like, I need
to change my life around. Like...

20:54.086 --> 20:56.088
I’m really scared as fuck.

20:59.550 --> 21:01.844
- Torelinio?
- Tolentino.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.471
Yeah. Step up here.

21:14.231 --> 21:16.692
- What’s holdin’ your hair up?
- My hair.

21:17.943 --> 21:19.111
<i>Your</i> hair?

21:20.446 --> 21:22.031
I see a string in there.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.701
- Do you have a string in there?
- A piece of string.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.578
- Take it out.
- I have to take it out?

21:30.039 --> 21:33.250
This is a duplicate. This is just
our copy and that’s your copy.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.255
[male sheriff Take your money receipt
and your property receipt.

21:41.217 --> 21:42.718
Attitude.

21:44.094 --> 21:46.722
Let me tell you something.
Well, you’re a fuckin’ whack-ass,

21:46.806 --> 21:48.849
nasty-ass fuckin’ correctional officer.

21:48.933 --> 21:52.728
All of you guys have miserable lives,
and was bullied when they was young.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.730
So, they gonna come in here and try

21:54.814 --> 21:57.691
to disturb the peace of the people
that’s already disturbed.

21:57.817 --> 22:00.694
Nothing irks me like a person that
thinks that they better than somebody

22:00.778 --> 22:02.321
because they got somethin’.

22:02.404 --> 22:05.616
Like, that fuckin’ badge
don’t mean shit after 10 o’clock.

22:06.033 --> 22:08.619
After 10 o’clock,
you're a regular person like I am.

22:11.413 --> 22:13.916
You think a person learns
from being in jail?

22:14.583 --> 22:16.418
You know what you get from being in here?

22:16.919 --> 22:18.212
You turn cold.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.172
And it just hurts.

22:24.677 --> 22:28.389
Based on the fact you’re here,
you don’t have no more rights.

22:34.436 --> 22:36.814
Places like this
don’t see the light in you.

22:41.110 --> 22:43.195
They just see you, you’re a criminal.

22:48.701 --> 22:51.036
I don't want to
fall into this trap.

22:58.043 --> 23:01.589
All I pray for
is that somebody sees my light.

23:18.772 --> 23:20.274
All right, I’ll need your key tag.

23:22.526 --> 23:23.652
Anything else in your pocket?

23:23.736 --> 23:24.570
Um, no.

23:26.238 --> 23:29.575
On our scheduled releases,
that particular inmate might be told

23:29.658 --> 23:32.453
at two or three in the morning to wake up.

23:32.912 --> 23:36.874
The deputy will call that inmate down,
tell them to pack all of their belongings,

23:36.957 --> 23:40.461
and they’re going ATW,
which means “all the way out”.

23:44.715 --> 23:48.260
Now they’re escorted
from their housing unit to a release area,

23:48.344 --> 23:50.512
which is adjacent to the admissions area.

23:51.055 --> 23:52.556
Right back where they started.

23:53.140 --> 23:55.809
So, it’s a circle of life, almost.

24:00.230 --> 24:03.359
I had to sit in here
for a long time.

24:06.111 --> 24:08.614
I never thought I would be going home.

24:12.826 --> 24:13.827
Make a right.

24:14.411 --> 24:17.081
You’re gonna make a left
at that hallway then another left.

24:17.164 --> 24:19.500
<i>I can see it. I damn near smell it.</i>

24:19.917 --> 24:21.335
<i>It’s hours away.</i>

24:21.418 --> 24:22.836
- There you go.
- Okay.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.546
Take a right down the hallway.

24:26.131 --> 24:27.007
Thank you.

24:27.383 --> 24:28.384
It's my birthday.

24:28.717 --> 24:30.260
Have a seat right there for me.

24:32.930 --> 24:35.516
Is this your first arrest,
or have you been arrested before?

24:35.599 --> 24:36.934
I’ve been arrested before.

24:37.017 --> 24:39.311
- It’s not my first rodeo.
- Okay.

24:39.853 --> 24:43.273
Have you ever been arrested
for kidnapping, murder, or sex offenses?

24:43.357 --> 24:44.692
- No.
- Okay.

24:47.444 --> 24:48.988
- Do you drink alcohol?
- Mm-hm.

24:49.071 --> 24:50.239
I’m an alcoholic.

24:52.408 --> 24:54.326
When was the last time
you drank alcohol?

24:56.036 --> 24:58.288
Let’s see. When did y’all lock me up?

25:00.874 --> 25:02.418
And how much do you drink?

25:03.669 --> 25:04.920
Ten beers a day.

25:08.882 --> 25:10.134
Five days a week.

25:11.927 --> 25:13.470
I drink ‘cause I’m an alcoholic,

25:13.554 --> 25:17.641
but I don’t have to wake up and drink,
and drink all through the day.

25:18.267 --> 25:22.146
My boyfriend drinks from the time he
wakes up till the time he goes to sleep.

25:22.229 --> 25:24.732
I’m like, why can’t you wait
till a certain time?

25:24.815 --> 25:26.608
He says, "It’s five o’clock somewhere."

25:30.029 --> 25:31.947
How much alcohol
did you drink today?

25:33.532 --> 25:36.577
- Nine beers.
- Nine beers? Thank you.

25:37.494 --> 25:40.414
<i>When I’m drinkin’ and he’s drinkin’,
always there's gonna be a fight.</i>

25:41.623 --> 25:45.461
I’ve been puttin’ him back and forth
in jail, and now I’m goin’ to jail.

25:52.134 --> 25:55.262
I saw a judge and I didn’t get no bond.

26:00.601 --> 26:04.438
I told myself, this was the last time
that I would do this.

26:04.521 --> 26:08.567
Like, literally, this was gonna be
my last trick for life.

26:09.193 --> 26:13.113
And I know, this time
I’m gonna have to, like, face time.

26:14.531 --> 26:16.366
Time for you to wake up. Get up.

26:19.369 --> 26:21.914
I just wanna be able
to have a life after this, you know?

26:24.166 --> 26:26.293
All right, step over here.
I need your left wrist.

26:27.002 --> 26:30.839
I’m, like scared to death, because
I’m afraid I’m gonna be in here forever.

26:34.384 --> 26:36.762
We’ll fingerprint you,
get you to sign your fingerprint cards,

26:36.845 --> 26:38.305
and then get you dressed in.

26:40.224 --> 26:41.767
If I didn’t have that boyfriend,

26:41.850 --> 26:44.603
I would probably...
I’d be sittin’ in here for a long time.

26:45.562 --> 26:48.524
I still have that glimmer of hope
that he's going to bail me out.

26:50.484 --> 26:54.321
All right, ladies. This is the final phase
of your property room dress-in process.

26:54.404 --> 26:57.199
You’ll get undressed,
everything is gonna go into clear bags.

26:57.282 --> 26:58.408
Then you go in the shower.

26:58.992 --> 27:03.247
<i>The dress-in process happens when
the inmate hasn’t been able to bond out.</i>

27:03.330 --> 27:07.501
It’s one of the most humbling experiences
an inmate can endure.

27:09.211 --> 27:11.463
Before they can go back
to our general population,

27:11.547 --> 27:13.757
we have to remove the outside world.

27:13.841 --> 27:16.343
And that is removing
all their outside clothing,

27:16.426 --> 27:19.805
and placing them
in our issued county clothing.

27:19.888 --> 27:22.766
It’s the transitioning of knowing
that I’m not going home,

27:22.850 --> 27:25.227
and now I’ll be formally a resident...

27:25.769 --> 27:27.271
of the Gwinnett County Jail.

27:31.525 --> 27:32.526
- Go in.
- Okay.

27:50.544 --> 27:52.004
- Spread your legs.
- Sorry.

28:06.852 --> 28:08.520
When I get out,
I’m seeing my cousin.

28:08.604 --> 28:11.315
Matter of fact, my cousin’s is gonna be
the first house that I stop at.

28:11.398 --> 28:13.150
Get dressed.
Make sure it's all there.

28:13.734 --> 28:17.112
Honestly, me talkin’ to him on the phone,
like, he is...

28:17.196 --> 28:21.158
so disappointed, so disappointed,
because he told me.

28:21.241 --> 28:24.203
He said, "Yo, stop smoking
in your car. Like, you...

28:24.286 --> 28:26.622
We live in, like, you’re in Gwinnett.
Like, you can’t...

28:26.705 --> 28:29.499
the shit you do on the east side
you cannot bring that shit here.

28:29.583 --> 28:31.001
They gon’ lock your ass up."

28:33.212 --> 28:36.006
<i>- I should've just listened to my cousin.</i>
- Take that downstairs.

28:36.840 --> 28:40.093
That shit gon’ be like me talkin’ to God
for Judgment Day.

28:54.233 --> 28:55.234
‘Sup, bro?

28:57.444 --> 29:00.781
Oh, you got a beard now. Check that, bruh.

29:02.449 --> 29:05.118
Yeah, I'm gonna call, like, your cousin.
I’m on my way to the house, yeah.

29:05.827 --> 29:07.663
This nigga is gonna be mad as fuck.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.164
Say goodbye to your home, Tyna.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.796
Fuck you, niggas!

29:16.755 --> 29:20.759
Yeah! Fuck you, motherfuckers!
I just got away!

29:24.680 --> 29:26.473
Dang, still know how to get
to cousin Lawrence's house!

29:26.598 --> 29:28.016
I’m not ringin’ that doorbell.

29:29.226 --> 29:33.021
I’m scared as fuck. Before I do,
let me finish smokin’ this black.

29:37.109 --> 29:39.319
Jesus Christ, yo, this shit,
I’m scared as fuck,

29:39.403 --> 29:40.737
like I’m goin’ to grandma's house.

29:41.405 --> 29:42.239
Yeah.

29:45.826 --> 29:46.702
'Sup, bro?

29:47.327 --> 29:49.788
- This is my favorite cousin right here.
- Good morning.

29:50.205 --> 29:51.581
You smell like weed.

29:51.957 --> 29:53.041
I am sorry.

29:54.710 --> 29:55.585
Hey, yo!

29:56.837 --> 29:59.840
Oh, no, we just gon’
talk right here.

30:00.424 --> 30:01.758
All jokes aside,

30:01.842 --> 30:03.468
you just wasted three months.

30:04.344 --> 30:07.180
Now, watch how your struggle
really starts...

30:07.931 --> 30:10.559
'cause your job search is fucked.

30:12.102 --> 30:16.356
You gotta keep your car on the road,
roof over your head, all that shit, so...

30:19.526 --> 30:20.360
What?

30:20.736 --> 30:24.197
I’m always telling you
shit can go wrong easy.

30:24.656 --> 30:25.949
Real easy.

30:26.325 --> 30:29.661
You just spent three months somewhere
for nothing.

30:30.537 --> 30:31.705
Little bit of weed?

30:33.165 --> 30:34.374
Um...

30:34.458 --> 30:36.668
Absolutely nothing.

30:42.049 --> 30:43.008
All right, cuz.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.345
- Love you, man.
- All right, homie.

30:54.603 --> 30:56.438
I’d rather him be pissed off

30:56.521 --> 30:59.274
or angry at me,
but he’s just so disappointed.

30:59.649 --> 31:01.360
It makes me feel bad.

31:02.027 --> 31:04.738
I don’t wanna disappoint him,
in any type of way.

31:31.223 --> 31:32.265
<i>Turn the noise down.</i>

31:41.900 --> 31:43.610
- Hello.
<i>- Hello.</i>

31:43.693 --> 31:45.362
Hey, they’re releasing me.

31:45.445 --> 31:47.155
<i>We all coming to pick you up.</i>

31:47.948 --> 31:48.907
Well, that’s good.

31:49.491 --> 31:52.619
Just all I ask for you and your safety,

31:52.702 --> 31:56.206
do not come down here
with any contraband.

31:56.748 --> 31:58.708
<i>Imma drive as safe as possible,</i>

31:58.792 --> 32:02.379
<i>and you pray to God these bitches
don’t pull me over on the way up.</i>

32:04.881 --> 32:07.426
- Please, just be safe.
<i>- Okay.</i>

32:11.096 --> 32:12.097
Buchanan.

32:13.598 --> 32:14.766
Carry your bin for me.

32:17.644 --> 32:18.895
All right, head that way.

32:23.191 --> 32:25.318
Don’t open this up
until you get downstairs.

32:26.653 --> 32:28.572
Here's a bag
for the rest of your stuff.

32:29.239 --> 32:31.700
<i>I’m just so proud of myself.
I made it.</i>

32:31.825 --> 32:33.034
Give me one second.

32:39.916 --> 32:44.171
This shit seems, like, unreal.
This shit seems like Christmas Day.

32:45.881 --> 32:47.549
Oh, my gosh, I'm going home.

32:48.842 --> 32:50.427
I don’t wanna cry.

33:10.197 --> 33:13.033
Never thought this fuckin’ moment
would fuckin’ happen.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.711
Definitely not puttin’ my mouth on this.

33:28.548 --> 33:31.259
Oh, Lord, there she go!

33:31.343 --> 33:33.929
They had you stone cold, sugar.

33:35.931 --> 33:37.098
My phone!

33:38.934 --> 33:42.312
Oh, look at the moon.
I have not seen the moon in so long.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.481
It's a crescent.

33:45.565 --> 33:47.651
Oh, my gosh!

33:47.734 --> 33:49.861
I'm free.

33:50.278 --> 33:51.404
The crickets.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.782
I hear crickets.

33:55.825 --> 33:57.118
You’ll never see me again.

33:57.202 --> 33:59.538
It’s a privilege having me
in this motherfucker.

33:59.996 --> 34:00.997
Fuck you, then.

34:02.415 --> 34:03.500
Is this Lasia?

34:04.417 --> 34:05.669
No, that's not Lasia.

34:06.461 --> 34:07.379
Fuck.

34:09.130 --> 34:10.757
Lasia, please be okay.

34:14.844 --> 34:15.762
I’m cold.

34:19.724 --> 34:21.351
- Keys to our apartment.
- Right.

34:21.434 --> 34:23.061
A welcome home party.

34:26.063 --> 34:29.192
At least we don’t have
a metal cold toilet...

34:30.235 --> 34:32.320
and metal cold sink.

34:33.112 --> 34:36.574
It looks like a little, um,
studio apartment in the Bronx.

34:36.658 --> 34:38.784
Right, that’s exactly
what we have right now.

34:39.244 --> 34:40.704
<i>I haven’t called my family.</i>

34:41.204 --> 34:44.456
<i>They don’t know I’m here.
I don’t wanna explain how I got here.</i>

34:44.541 --> 34:46.918
When you experience things
like this, you realize,

34:47.002 --> 34:50.630
like, you’re not only hurting yourself.
You're hurting everybody around you.

34:50.714 --> 34:53.632
I know my grandmother is probably like,
“Where is this girl?”

34:56.511 --> 34:59.931
Nothing I have done is worth it,
is worth being here.

35:01.558 --> 35:03.685
I just pray that I get a second chance.

35:17.824 --> 35:21.411
I think I could have avoided
a lotta situations.

35:22.329 --> 35:25.206
I feel like I could’ve done
a lotta things differently.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.043
But I'm learning to...

35:28.543 --> 35:31.546
to let go of things that I can't change.

35:34.966 --> 35:39.763
I’m going to have a motherfucking story
to tell when I get home.

36:06.956 --> 36:08.041
Know what I'm saying?

36:14.839 --> 36:16.508
Who’s got a lit cigarette?

36:17.258 --> 36:19.552
You got a lit cigarette.
Can I butt-fuck ya?

36:21.554 --> 36:25.392
<i>Tell you what, this is my first time
in Gwinnett County. Never again.</i>

36:25.975 --> 36:27.811
I’ve seen enough jail. That’s it.

36:28.353 --> 36:30.647
I want a lawn chair
so I can lay out and get some damn sun.

36:30.730 --> 36:31.690
I know, right?

36:32.315 --> 36:34.859
I’ll be layin’ out in my granny panties
and my bra.

36:35.443 --> 36:38.279
But I’m tryin’ to, like,
mentally wrap my head around...

36:38.947 --> 36:41.199
bein’ here,
so I’ve already started my routine.

36:41.282 --> 36:42.992
In my room, I’m doin’ this...

36:45.120 --> 36:46.413
to do my cardio.

36:47.706 --> 36:50.208
I kinda like being
a little bit more clear-headed,

36:50.291 --> 36:52.210
and being in my right mind

36:52.293 --> 36:54.671
instead of fuzzy-headed all the time,

36:54.754 --> 36:56.798
where I should've made better decisions.

36:56.881 --> 36:59.300
And alcohol just makes you
make bad decisions.

37:01.177 --> 37:02.095
<i>Hello.</i>

37:02.178 --> 37:04.180
Why are you not answering my phone calls?

37:04.681 --> 37:06.975
<i>Because I gotta pay for it.</i>

37:07.058 --> 37:08.268
Just pay for it.

37:09.310 --> 37:11.229
Are you trying to get me out?

37:11.813 --> 37:13.106
<i>I don’t have no money, Carlotta.</i>

37:13.273 --> 37:15.108
You gotta get me out of jail, baby.

37:15.191 --> 37:17.193
Please, I’m counting on you
to do this for me on Friday.

37:17.652 --> 37:19.946
<i>You’re not gonna get out
and treat me like crap, are you?</i>

37:20.321 --> 37:21.322
No!

37:21.448 --> 37:23.575
<i>When you get out,
me and you gotta have a talk.</i>

37:23.658 --> 37:24.617
About what?

37:25.118 --> 37:27.620
<i>Just a talk. It ain’t nothin’ bad.</i>

37:27.704 --> 37:30.248
You and I definitely
do need to have a talk,

37:30.331 --> 37:31.416
but you need to bail me out.

37:31.499 --> 37:32.333
Okay?

37:35.587 --> 37:37.839
I’ve kicked it in the woods with him,
being homeless.

37:37.922 --> 37:40.300
We’ve been evicted, I lost all my stuff.

37:40.800 --> 37:43.052
And if he can’t waste one paycheck,

37:43.553 --> 37:47.474
to sacrifice like I’ve sacrificed, to get
me outta jail, I'm going to be pissed.

37:48.433 --> 37:49.976
So, I might be single.

37:51.686 --> 37:54.105
But he can have a lonely life
with his fuckin’ beer.

38:01.738 --> 38:05.450
Good afternoon,
reporting live from Gwinnett County.

38:05.992 --> 38:08.953
I’ve been upstairs for about four days.

38:09.579 --> 38:12.165
But I make a week in total tomorrow.

38:13.833 --> 38:15.710
I’m just staying in my positive thoughts.

38:15.794 --> 38:18.463
I talk to my God, I talk to my angels.

38:19.464 --> 38:22.050
And I hope that they will put me
in the right path after this.

38:30.433 --> 38:34.521
"Dear Keith, it’s Wednesday, 12-something.
You're supposed to be asleep.

38:34.604 --> 38:37.065
I just want you to know
everything’ll be all right.

38:37.148 --> 38:40.026
The pain you endure won’t compare
to the joy that you’re gonna get.

38:40.109 --> 38:43.571
Move the fuck on, baby boy.
I love you, be strong. Mwah."

38:44.572 --> 38:46.032
And I wrote that to myself...

38:46.616 --> 38:48.451
when I was, like, losing it.

38:49.118 --> 38:51.120
And now it’s just like...

38:51.204 --> 38:52.413
Aaagh!

38:52.497 --> 38:54.833
You know, it’s birds chirping, it’s like,

38:54.916 --> 38:57.210
good feeling, beautiful sight.

38:57.710 --> 38:58.628
Ready to go home.

39:00.672 --> 39:01.506
Yeah.

39:07.929 --> 39:10.765
I’m gonna ask you to not start tearing
into this until you get downstairs.

39:10.849 --> 39:14.394
If something pops out, hits the floor,
and rolls around, that’s not on us.

39:15.311 --> 39:18.189
- Really? Ma'am?
- My lips are chapped.

39:27.031 --> 39:31.661
I’ve just had the worst week in my life.
Now I just wanna relax and calm down.

39:31.744 --> 39:33.872
And the only thing
that takes the edge off is a beer.

39:35.665 --> 39:38.626
In jail, I tried to make it seem
like it was all good,

39:38.710 --> 39:42.297
and bein’ the life of the party,
but in reality, I was just broken.

39:43.131 --> 39:46.801
I thought about a lotta things
that I’ve been through, even in 226B,

39:46.885 --> 39:50.305
and I don’t wanna put myself in a
situation like that ever again in my life.

39:50.388 --> 39:53.933
So, I will not smoke marijuana ever again.

40:07.071 --> 40:08.406
You never look nervous, man.

40:08.489 --> 40:09.324
Me?

40:10.909 --> 40:12.744
<i>A few things I gotta do
when I get outta here.</i>

40:12.827 --> 40:14.454
Just not drink when I get out.

40:17.123 --> 40:19.584
I don’t crave it in here.
Why should I crave it out there?

40:20.668 --> 40:22.795
I gotta quit drinkin’, smokin’
and get my shit straight!

40:22.879 --> 40:24.672
Am I shakin’ and jonesin’ for it? No.

40:25.465 --> 40:27.800
I had one quart, this is my second.
There's no more after this.

40:27.884 --> 40:29.469
One’s too many, a thousand ain’t enough.

40:29.802 --> 40:31.512
Don’t piss me off
‘cause I ain’t in the mood!

40:33.431 --> 40:35.475
You cannot even imagine
what I’ve been through.
