00:38.177 --> 00:41.462
Well, you're certainly doing your
job today, Mr. Sun.

00:43.349 --> 00:45.140
Oh, rats.

00:47.645 --> 00:49.637
And here we have
the world-famous Beatles...

00:49.813 --> 00:53.348
...exactly as they looked performing
on The Ed Sullivan Show.

00:54.693 --> 00:57.101
I hardly think it's fair to be
charged full price.

00:57.279 --> 01:00.280
I'm up to my knees
in the original cast of M* A * S *H.

01:10.918 --> 01:15.876
- Homer, my hat goes off to you.
- It's cool in here, boy.

01:16.900 --> 01:19.874
For the rest of the summer,
we can live inside the refrigerator.

01:21.950 --> 01:23.930
Homer, the fridge wasn't meant
to be used this way.

01:24.431 --> 01:28.180
Although I must say,
it's certainly refreshing.

01:34.692 --> 01:37.562
I got the idea when I noticed
the refrigerator was cold.

01:38.280 --> 01:39.937
Won't this overload the motor?

01:45.411 --> 01:47.699
Marge, can you set the oven to cold?

01:59.800 --> 02:03.335
Ice cream! Ice cream!

02:06.598 --> 02:11.675
I'm all out of ice cream! It's true,
you know. Ice cream! Ice cream!

02:12.620 --> 02:13.604
Fresh out of ice cream!

02:18.110 --> 02:21.693
Chili! Red-hot, Texas-style chili!

02:21.864 --> 02:27.867
And we got ginger ale.
Boiling hot, Texas-style ginger ale!

02:28.370 --> 02:29.697
Texas!

02:29.872 --> 02:34.949
Face it, Bart. Our salvation isn't gonna
roll by on the back of some stupid truck.

02:40.382 --> 02:41.960
I gotta replace that window.

02:42.176 --> 02:43.800
- Pool-mobile?
- Pool-mobile?

02:50.517 --> 02:54.170
Look, Lis, I snatched five
bathing suits. All Martin's.

02:54.229 --> 02:57.349
Take your best shot.
I'm wearing 17 layers.

03:01.904 --> 03:03.896
I brought this on myself.

03:04.740 --> 03:08.785
Okay, little dudes, time's up.
Everybody out!

03:12.373 --> 03:14.199
- Time's up?
- So long, Lis.

03:14.375 --> 03:17.162
I'm gonna stow away underwater
and go where the pool goes.

03:17.336 --> 03:18.878
Have a good life.

03:24.134 --> 03:27.135
Sorry, Bart, dude. We gotta fill
this thing with Epsom salts...

03:27.304 --> 03:31.384
...and jam over to the old folks' home.
- Oh, well. Same time tomorrow, Otto?

03:31.767 --> 03:35.634
No way, man. One day of summer's
all we're budgeted for.

03:35.980 --> 03:38.553
I guess it is kind of a tease.

03:41.944 --> 03:43.403
Dad?

03:44.321 --> 03:45.732
Dad?

03:47.199 --> 03:49.156
- Dad!
- Yes, Lisa?

03:49.368 --> 03:51.361
Dad, as you know,
we've been swimming.

03:51.578 --> 03:53.238
And we've developed a taste for it.

03:53.455 --> 03:56.492
We both agree that getting
our own pool is the only way to go.

03:56.709 --> 03:59.460
Now, before you respond,
understand that your refusal...

03:59.628 --> 04:01.621
...would result in
months and months of:

04:01.797 --> 04:04.466
- Can we have a pool, Dad?
- Can we have a pool, Dad?

04:04.633 --> 04:07.890
- Can we have a pool, Dad?
- Can we have a pool, Dad?

04:07.678 --> 04:09.600
I understand.

04:09.930 --> 04:14.259
Let us celebrate our new arrangement
with the adding of chocolate to milk.

04:18.772 --> 04:21.809
Over here we have the Hick Tub,
the Insta-Rust.

04:21.983 --> 04:23.526
That's the Lightning Magnet.

04:23.777 --> 04:26.190
- That's the Tinkler.
- The Tinkler.

04:26.196 --> 04:28.355
I like the sound of that.
We'll take it.

04:28.574 --> 04:32.730
Is it true we should wait at least
an hour after eating before we go in?

04:32.286 --> 04:36.153
Look, question lady, this job is not
what I really do, okay? I play keyboards.

04:51.597 --> 04:54.598
All right, everybody in the pool!

04:54.892 --> 04:58.950
'Tis a fine barn,
but sure 'tis no pool, English.

05:00.439 --> 05:02.515
- Is it a pool yet?
- Yes, Dad.

05:04.401 --> 05:05.564
Who could that be?

05:07.821 --> 05:10.526
Hello, Mrs. Bart.

05:11.158 --> 05:12.569
Is your pool ready yet?

05:18.248 --> 05:22.377
Bart, are all these children
friends of yours?

05:22.544 --> 05:24.703
Friends and well-wishers, yes.

05:24.922 --> 05:26.250
- Hey, Bart.
- Hi, Bart.

05:26.423 --> 05:29.210
- Hey, my buddy, Bart.
- Hello, Mrs. Converdale.

05:34.556 --> 05:38.471
People! People, it's time we all
discussed the pool-safety rules.

05:38.686 --> 05:40.180
Jump, Bart, jump!

05:40.562 --> 05:42.520
Jump, Bart, jump!

05:42.773 --> 05:44.148
You got it.

05:44.525 --> 05:47.941
Hey, Bart! Your epidermis is showing!

05:48.112 --> 05:49.440
It is?

05:54.243 --> 05:57.300
See, epidermis means your hair.

05:59.810 --> 06:02.532
So technically it's true.
That's what makes it so funny.

06:02.876 --> 06:04.703
Pardon me a moment.

06:06.422 --> 06:10.716
Hey, Nelson. He's really hurt.
I think he broke his leg.

06:10.884 --> 06:12.820
I said:

06:28.319 --> 06:30.228
Get this kid a magazine, stat.

06:32.406 --> 06:35.750
I'm sorry, that leg's gonna
have to come off.

06:37.244 --> 06:40.827
Did I say leg?
I meant that wet bathing suit.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.159
I'm afraid you'll need a cast
on that broken bone.

06:45.294 --> 06:47.121
I'm gonna miss the whole summer.

06:47.296 --> 06:51.874
Don't worry, boy. When you get a job
like me, you'll miss every summer.

06:52.259 --> 06:54.667
Isn't it amazing, the same
day you got a pool...

06:54.845 --> 06:57.300
...is the same day we realized
we liked you?

06:57.222 --> 06:59.429
The timing worked out great,
don't you think?

07:00.351 --> 07:02.972
- Hi.
- Hey, guys! Sign my cast?

07:03.145 --> 07:05.766
Sign my cast? Guys?

07:08.275 --> 07:11.395
- Milhouse!
- Hi, Bart.

07:11.779 --> 07:17.153
Faithful Milhouse. You'll spend the long,
hot days by my side, won't you?

07:17.368 --> 07:21.448
I think I lost my glasses in your pool.
I better go in and find them.

07:21.622 --> 07:25.380
- But you're wearing your glasses.
- No, I'm not.

07:27.860 --> 07:28.746
Oh, look. Bart's all alone.

07:29.129 --> 07:31.122
Maybe I should keep him company,
at least for a little while.

07:33.300 --> 07:35.174
- Hey, come watch this.
- Lisa! Hey, look.

07:41.892 --> 07:43.683
Coming!

07:45.896 --> 07:49.182
Well, it looks like it's just
you and me, Barty boy.

07:49.566 --> 07:53.180
Great. I get to spend
the summer with my brain.

07:53.445 --> 07:57.110
What fun can you have in a pool anyway
that you can't have in a bathtub...

07:57.282 --> 07:59.738
...with a garbage bag taped
around your cast?

08:41.201 --> 08:46.741
Traitors! Go on and have your pool!
I'm fine by myself right here.

09:43.972 --> 09:46.120
You know, this isn't so bad.

09:46.225 --> 09:48.894
I'll just spend the summer
getting better acquainted...

09:49.610 --> 09:51.896
...with an old friend called television.

09:55.526 --> 09:59.654
Hope you enjoyed that, kids, because
Krusty's out of here for the summer.

09:59.863 --> 10:02.319
In the meantime, we'll be running...

10:03.158 --> 10:06.942
...classic Krusty. Enjoy!

10:11.250 --> 10:16.420
Good evening. Tonight my guest
is AFL-CIO Chairman George Meany...

10:16.255 --> 10:19.900
...who will be discussing
collective-bargaining agreements.

10:19.299 --> 10:22.510
- It's a pleasure to be here, Krusty.
- Let me be blunt.

10:22.261 --> 10:25.960
Is there a labor crisis
in America today?

10:25.264 --> 10:27.422
Well, that depends
what you mean by crisis.

10:30.436 --> 10:32.891
There's nothing like
rising with the sun...

10:33.630 --> 10:37.610
...for a quiet, peaceful dip
in your very own pool.

10:46.760 --> 10:49.492
Lisa, the blob has got me!
Don't touch me or it'll get you too!

10:49.663 --> 10:54.760
Dad, you have to put chlorine in
the water every day to keep it clean.

10:54.293 --> 10:56.120
Chlorine, eh?

10:59.506 --> 11:01.713
My face is on fire!

11:03.469 --> 11:06.470
Oh, look. There's Bart. Wave to him.

11:09.475 --> 11:11.800
Maybe we should spend
more time with Bart.

11:12.190 --> 11:14.724
He's becoming isolated and weird.

11:15.640 --> 11:19.642
"I swear I don't know where the
bombs are! Only the miners know that!"

11:19.902 --> 11:24.300
"Maybe this will loosen your tongue."
"No!"

11:25.407 --> 11:27.151
- Bart?
- Don't turn on that light!

11:27.368 --> 11:29.656
Sorry, I just came to see
how you were feeling.

11:29.828 --> 11:32.663
- I'm fine, just fine.
- What are you writing here, a play?

11:33.624 --> 11:36.790
- No.
- "Cast of characters:

11:36.251 --> 11:39.205
Viceroy Fizzlebottom,
a hearty cherub of a man..."

11:39.380 --> 11:41.621
Give me that! It's a work in progress.

11:43.258 --> 11:44.634
So.

11:44.843 --> 11:46.635
How do you like
being Miss Popularity?

11:46.887 --> 11:49.758
Oh, well, you know, it ain't so great.

11:51.183 --> 11:54.517
Bart, it's the best thing that ever
happened to me in my whole life!

11:54.687 --> 11:58.186
Well, anyway, I brought you a present.
Look, it's the telescope I won...

11:58.357 --> 11:59.685
...at the Optics Festival.

11:59.858 --> 12:03.393
There was an Optics Festival
and I wasn't informed? You go now.

12:03.612 --> 12:05.190
- But...
- Go!

12:07.825 --> 12:12.652
What have we here?
"The Lighter Side of Hippies."

12:13.622 --> 12:16.409
They don't care whose toes
they step on.

12:24.591 --> 12:27.462
This was a lovely idea, Homie.

12:27.636 --> 12:29.925
Come here and kiss me.

12:34.935 --> 12:39.630
Do not be alarmed.
Continue swimming naked.

12:39.898 --> 12:45.604
Come on. Continue. Come on...

12:46.238 --> 12:47.863
All right, Lou, open fire.

12:52.411 --> 12:56.456
Wow, the universe is so boring.

12:56.707 --> 13:01.701
I know. I'll use this to peer into
Springfield's seamy underbelly.

13:09.261 --> 13:11.669
It turned out it was his evil twin.

13:16.477 --> 13:20.854
Grace, come here. There's a
sinister-looking kid I want you to see.

13:21.899 --> 13:26.311
I'm never gonna see anything interesting
with this stupid piece of junk.

13:32.409 --> 13:34.532
That came from Flanders' house.

13:44.171 --> 13:47.670
Oh, my God! What have I done?
I've killed her!

13:48.967 --> 13:52.668
It can't be what it looks like.
This is Flanders we're talking about.

13:53.681 --> 13:55.910
I'll just watch some TV.

13:55.307 --> 13:59.886
Now, what you've been waiting for:
Another long raga by Ravi Shankar.

14:01.188 --> 14:02.766
- Shankar.
- Shankar.

14:02.940 --> 14:04.897
Groovy, man.

14:15.244 --> 14:19.538
This can't be what it looks like.
There's gotta be some other explanation.

14:19.707 --> 14:23.751
I wish there was some other
explanation for this, but there isn't!

14:24.440 --> 14:26.167
I'm a murderer! I'm a murderer!

14:26.463 --> 14:28.670
Then that's not the real Ned Flanders.

14:29.216 --> 14:31.968
I'm a mur-diddly-erdiler!

14:32.261 --> 14:35.960
If that's not Flanders,
he's done his homework.

14:40.227 --> 14:42.267
Daddy, where's Mommy?
We miss her.

14:42.438 --> 14:45.439
Mommy had to go away.
She's with God now.

14:46.609 --> 14:48.352
Can we go there too?

14:48.610 --> 14:50.437
Soon enough.

14:52.364 --> 14:54.606
He's gonna kill Rod and Todd too!

14:54.783 --> 14:56.491
That's horrible...

14:56.952 --> 14:58.233
...in principle.

14:59.413 --> 15:03.780
Look, Lisa. I found this change
on the bottom of the pool.

15:03.250 --> 15:06.370
- You can have it.
- Thanks, Nelson.

15:07.421 --> 15:10.900
Somebody took my juice money.

15:10.299 --> 15:13.668
Lisa, please join my family
for a weekend in the country.

15:14.530 --> 15:15.677
There'll be hunting, charades...

15:15.846 --> 15:18.966
...and ever so many delightful,
romantic misunderstandings.

15:19.350 --> 15:21.307
- Lisa, Lisa!
- Watch me!

15:22.102 --> 15:24.474
They're only using you
for your pool, you know.

15:24.688 --> 15:28.570
Shut up, brain. I got friends now.
I don't need you anymore.

15:29.943 --> 15:33.526
Yeah, I'd love to go to your house.

15:36.617 --> 15:38.444
My plan has come to fruition.

15:38.619 --> 15:40.742
Soon I'll be queen of summertime.

15:41.380 --> 15:42.497
Oh, king. King!

15:48.712 --> 15:54.252
Dude, buzz has it an even wussier kid
has an even better pool than this.

16:01.517 --> 16:05.182
Hello? Hey, I'm stuck in here.

16:05.354 --> 16:07.512
I gotta think of a way to get out.

16:07.898 --> 16:11.647
Well, well, well.
Look who 's come crawling back.

16:12.270 --> 16:14.862
Listen, Ned Flanders murdered his wife!

16:15.720 --> 16:17.397
But why? She's such a fox.

16:17.574 --> 16:21.260
I mean, what's on Fox tonight?
Something ribald, no doubt.

16:21.453 --> 16:23.944
I wish you'd stop spreading
bad rumors about people.

16:24.123 --> 16:26.448
Remember how you got Grampa
tarred and feathered?

16:26.625 --> 16:28.840
Sure. That was 20 minutes ago.

16:28.252 --> 16:29.794
Gonna be in the tub for a while.

16:31.964 --> 16:34.669
Bart, I'm really sorry
I've been ignoring you lately.

16:34.842 --> 16:37.830
I got carried away with being popular.

16:37.261 --> 16:41.175
But now that I'm unpopular again,
I want you to know I'm here for you.

16:41.390 --> 16:43.548
You can start making it up
to me right now.

16:43.726 --> 16:46.762
Flanders is leaving the house.
I want you to sneak in there...

16:46.937 --> 16:49.393
...and bring me some evidence!
And something sweet.

16:49.606 --> 16:52.228
Bart, I'm not gonna
break into somebody's house.

16:52.443 --> 16:55.112
All right. You're right.
Let's just forget about that.

16:55.279 --> 16:58.196
Here, let me read to you
from my play.

16:58.449 --> 17:03.194
"Kippers for breakfast, Aunt Helga?
Is it Saint Swiven's Day already?

17:03.370 --> 17:07.997
- 'Tis, replied Aunt Helga..."
- I'm going, I'm going.

17:21.130 --> 17:22.637
A human head!

17:26.518 --> 17:27.929
Of course.

17:29.605 --> 17:31.644
Oh, no.
He's back. Flanders is back.

17:31.815 --> 17:33.357
Lisa, get out of there!

17:34.651 --> 17:37.487
No, Lisa, don't go upstairs.
You'll be trapped!

17:39.490 --> 17:41.281
An ax! He's got an ax!

17:41.450 --> 17:43.608
I'll save you, Lisa!

17:45.204 --> 17:47.280
I'll save you by calling the police.

17:48.290 --> 17:52.502
Hello, and welcome to the Springfield
Police Department Rescue Phone.

17:52.670 --> 17:56.370
If you know the name of the felony
being committed, press one.

17:56.632 --> 17:59.633
To choose from a list of felonies,
press two.

18:00.135 --> 18:03.530
If you are being murdered
or calling from a rotary phone...

18:03.222 --> 18:06.900
...please stay on the line.

18:06.725 --> 18:09.500
You have selected regicide.

18:09.228 --> 18:13.806
If you know the name of the king
or queen being murdered, press one.

18:20.906 --> 18:22.982
I'll save you, cast or no cast!

18:26.328 --> 18:30.907
Gotta save Lisa,
trash can or no trash can.

18:44.722 --> 18:48.850
Oh, no. That sinister-looking kid
is coming to kill me.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.224
Help! Help!

19:00.738 --> 19:02.730
Oh, no. Oh, no.

19:37.733 --> 19:41.660
It's time to put you away.

19:42.404 --> 19:44.480
Put you away for good.

19:46.867 --> 19:49.730
No!

19:51.288 --> 19:53.162
What the gumdrops is going on here?

19:53.457 --> 19:56.992
I came to stop you from murdering Lisa
like you murdered your wife!

19:57.169 --> 19:59.430
Murdered?

20:02.549 --> 20:05.337
Murdered? No, I've just been
in the country for a week.

20:05.511 --> 20:08.381
But I distinctly heard you say
that Maude was with God.

20:08.597 --> 20:13.306
That's right. I was at Bible camp. I was
learning how to be more judgmental.

20:13.519 --> 20:17.219
But I saw the murder, and then I saw
you bury the corpse in the backyard!

20:17.398 --> 20:20.268
All right, it's true! I am a murderer!

20:21.443 --> 20:23.732
I over-watered Maude's
favorite ficus plant...

20:23.904 --> 20:26.656
...I panicked, and then
I buried the remains.

20:26.865 --> 20:29.570
I was hoping to replace it
before you got home.

20:30.350 --> 20:31.992
But I heard a woman scream.

20:33.380 --> 20:36.822
- Well, now, that I can't explain.
- We found it, chief.

20:38.210 --> 20:40.203
Well, I guess that explains everything.

20:40.379 --> 20:45.420
Not everything. There's still the little
matter of the whereabouts of your wife.

20:45.801 --> 20:48.900
- I'm right here.
- Oh, I see.

20:48.303 --> 20:51.589
Then everything is wrapped up
in a neat little package.

20:52.599 --> 20:54.580
Really, I mean that.

20:54.268 --> 20:56.426
Sorry if it sounded sarcastic.

21:00.315 --> 21:02.522
More friends! More allies!

21:02.693 --> 21:05.528
More, I say.
Hang those who talk of less.

21:05.696 --> 21:07.938
There's a few inches over here.

21:15.581 --> 21:18.866
My precious pool
and its lifestyle accouterments.

21:19.420 --> 21:20.501
No!

21:21.128 --> 21:23.251
- What a drag.
- I hear you.

21:31.513 --> 21:34.965
The gentle caress of a summer breeze.

22:50.884 --> 22:52.960
