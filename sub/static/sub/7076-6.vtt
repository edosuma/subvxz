WEBVTT

00:03.203 --> 00:05.723
Damn it!

00:05.757 --> 00:09.764
Put the teethy wrench on the
square thing and jiggle it left.

00:17.130 --> 00:20.251
Thanks... by the way, that
square thing is a Hampton bolt

00:20.285 --> 00:21.922
and what you just described
is a manacheck maneuver.

00:21.956 --> 00:24.493
Hey, I'm just here
for the tater tots.

00:26.348 --> 00:29.570
Look, I know you think you
made your mind up about plumbing

00:29.604 --> 00:31.173
and I respect that.

00:31.208 --> 00:32.844
But come to the third floor
men's room tomorrow

00:32.878 --> 00:34.079
any time after 3:00.

00:34.114 --> 00:35.415
Unclog one toilet with me

00:35.449 --> 00:37.119
and tell me
you don't feel something.

00:37.153 --> 00:39.089
And I'll never
bring it up again.

00:39.124 --> 00:41.042
All right...One toilet.

00:41.093 --> 00:42.879
If it will get you off my back.

00:44.333 --> 00:45.301
Abed, look.

00:45.335 --> 00:47.889
Cool, Stonehenge.

00:47.940 --> 00:51.346
Excuse me, are you Pierce
Hawthorne of Hawthorne Wipes?

00:51.380 --> 00:52.849
At your cervix.

00:52.867 --> 00:54.820
Oh, sorry, I thought
you were a lady.

00:54.854 --> 00:56.489
You can use that
cervix line if you want.

00:56.523 --> 00:57.741
I told you it was him.

00:57.794 --> 00:59.362
Would you mind signing this?

00:59.396 --> 01:00.664

Fans of the product, I suppose.

01:12.489 --> 01:14.492
In the wipes business
we call them towel-heads.

01:14.526 --> 01:16.729
I'm just impressed you got
through a whole conversation

01:16.764 --> 01:19.034
with two gay men
without doing this.

01:19.068 --> 01:20.904
Wait...Those guys were--

01:20.922 --> 01:22.173
Mm-hmm.

01:22.208 --> 01:24.077
I assumed they were just
brothers or wealthy.

01:24.111 --> 01:25.796
Why do you think they
wanted your autograph?

your moist towelettes

01:47.791 --> 01:50.428
What do Hawthorne wipes have
to do with the choice to be gay?

01:50.463 --> 01:52.532
Well, according to Wikipedia--

01:54.854 --> 01:57.442
Oh, my...Even Bruce Vilanch?

01:57.477 --> 01:58.745
Especially Bruce Vilanch.

01:58.779 --> 02:02.319
That is copyright infringement
and defamation.

02:02.337 --> 02:03.821
I'm going to sue
the pants off that lady.

02:03.856 --> 02:05.542
- I don't think that's a lady.
- And why do you

02:05.593 --> 02:07.128
want his pants off?
Shut up!

02:07.162 --> 02:09.232
I only wanted his pants off
when I thought he was a lady.

02:09.265 --> 02:10.234
So you were attracted to him?

02:10.268 --> 02:11.971
The only thing I'm attracted to

02:12.005 --> 02:15.177
is taking him to court
and eating his ass alive.

02:15.195 --> 02:16.563
- Ooh!
- That's not what I meant.

02:16.614 --> 02:18.400

I hope Pierce doesn't really
sue that lady-man singer.

02:54.689 --> 02:55.890
His life must be hard enough

02:55.924 --> 02:57.727
having to sew pouches
in all his miniskirts.

02:57.762 --> 02:59.364
Yes, I'm always
nice to the gays.

02:59.399 --> 03:00.967
They may live
in defiance of God,

03:01.001 --> 03:02.737

I let a woman touch my hair.

03:04.091 --> 03:05.877
Hey, what's
going on with you bitches?

03:05.911 --> 03:09.283
Bitches is gay talk for friends.

03:09.317 --> 03:11.822
Did you sue Urbana
Champaign for his t-shirt?

03:11.856 --> 03:14.560
Not at all, I bought this.
I'm a fan.

03:14.594 --> 03:16.280
Also,
I'm a gay rights advocate.

03:16.331 --> 03:17.800
I think I can explain.

03:17.834 --> 03:20.205
Pierce's positrons have been
negatized, creating anti-Pierce.

03:20.239 --> 03:21.624
<i>It happens all the time
inspector spacetime.</i>

03:21.675 --> 03:23.945
Yeah, but anti-inspector
had a funny mustache

03:23.979 --> 03:25.649
and was kinda rapey.

03:25.683 --> 03:27.886
I don't think his positrons
have been negatized.

03:27.921 --> 03:29.289
That's exactly what
Constable Reggie said.

03:29.323 --> 03:32.161
No, I thought about it,
and I decided a man

03:32.196 --> 03:35.518
should not be judged by what he
does with a fellow man's butt.

03:35.569 --> 03:37.772
- Here's the kick.
- Plus since that song came out,

03:37.807 --> 03:39.994
Hawthorne Wipes sales
went up 7%.

03:40.028 --> 03:42.165
- And it's good.
- Yep, even had my own people

03:42.199 --> 03:45.421
mock up a design
for a new product line.

03:45.455 --> 03:46.923
Hawthorne Pride Wipes.

03:46.958 --> 03:49.379
They may cost more,
but they're gayer.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.298
And I'm gonna launch
these little babies

03:51.333 --> 03:53.202
at a big party
here at Greendale.

03:53.237 --> 03:55.741
Here's a flyer.
Ooh!

03:55.775 --> 03:58.714
Greendale's first annual...
gay bash.

03:58.748 --> 04:01.519
Wow, Pierce,
congratulations on meeting

04:01.553 --> 04:03.523
the minimum requirements
for open-mindedness.

04:03.557 --> 04:06.562
Yeah, I'm really proud of you.
You're growing as a person.

04:06.596 --> 04:07.965
Oh, good grief,

04:08.000 --> 04:09.735
he's not supporting gay people.
They're supporting him.

04:09.769 --> 04:11.172
If Mexicans were
buying his wipes,

04:11.206 --> 04:12.591
he would have
ridden in on a donkey.

04:12.642 --> 04:15.430
People earning respect with
money is the American way, Jeff.

04:15.481 --> 04:17.434
Not that my father
would have agreed.

04:17.485 --> 04:19.438
It took a federal
injunction to get him

04:19.488 --> 04:20.923
to sell these things
to the Italians.

04:20.958 --> 04:22.426
Oh, I see what's going on here!

04:22.460 --> 04:23.996
In my psych class
I'm learning about

04:24.031 --> 04:25.783
this thing called
the edible complex.

04:25.834 --> 04:27.938
All men have to
kill their fathers

04:27.972 --> 04:29.791
so they can do something
to their mothers.

04:29.842 --> 04:31.144
I haven't finished the chapter.

04:31.178 --> 04:32.546
What's that complex called

04:32.581 --> 04:33.933
where you're wrong
about everything?

04:33.967 --> 04:36.788
Huh, sarcasm from the man with
the mother of all daddy issues.

04:36.822 --> 04:38.291
Whoa, double diagnosis.

04:38.326 --> 04:40.429
Save some for all those
poor real doctors.

04:40.463 --> 04:42.616
Pierce, what type of cookies
do you want at the party?

04:42.651 --> 04:44.770
We have peanut butter
or chocolate chip.

04:44.788 --> 04:46.741
Rainbow, bitches.

04:46.775 --> 04:49.714
We can have peanut butter
or chocolate chip.

04:55.692 --> 04:56.660
Well?

04:56.694 --> 04:58.197
It's pretty great!

05:01.037 --> 05:03.040
Tight seal, good flow.

05:03.074 --> 05:04.676
Kid's pretty handy.

05:04.710 --> 05:06.947
You get the hell out of here!

05:06.981 --> 05:08.116
Go on!

05:13.010 --> 05:15.130
- Who was that?
- You listen to me.

05:15.164 --> 05:17.167
What you have is a gift.

05:17.201 --> 05:20.073
And some people are going to try
to take advantage of that gift.

05:20.107 --> 05:21.843
Promise me
you'll use it for good.

05:21.878 --> 05:23.363
All right, I promise.

05:23.397 --> 05:26.385
Good. Now, come with me
to the second floor.

05:26.420 --> 05:28.423
Somebody pooped in the sink.

05:31.880 --> 05:33.383
You know, we actually
have a lot in common.

05:33.417 --> 05:36.221
We hate lesbians,
we hate baggy pants,

05:36.256 --> 05:38.393
and I can't believe you guys
are all bears fans.

05:38.427 --> 05:40.112
- Super fans.
- Randall!

05:40.146 --> 05:42.483
Somebody take a picture.
Come on...

05:43.654 --> 05:45.155
Okay, now let's
take a silly one.

05:45.190 --> 05:48.963
- Okay, okay!
- All right.

05:48.997 --> 05:52.870
Piercinald Anastasia Hawthorne!

05:52.905 --> 05:53.905
Father.

05:57.247 --> 05:59.917
We need to talk, boy.

06:10.957 --> 06:12.375
Oh--

06:14.514 --> 06:16.550
Gentlemen.

06:16.584 --> 06:18.654
You are here tonight because
you have been selected

06:18.688 --> 06:20.691
as potential candidates
for the Greendale

06:20.726 --> 06:24.433
Air Conditioning Repair School.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.303
But why kidnap you?

06:26.337 --> 06:28.541
Why put a sack over your head

06:28.575 --> 06:31.045
and drag you here in
the middle of the night?

06:31.079 --> 06:34.853
Why is there an astronaut in
the corner making paninis?

06:34.887 --> 06:37.859
Simple, we don't want you
to tell anyone about this.

06:37.893 --> 06:41.399
And if you do, we don't
want them believing you.

06:41.433 --> 06:43.854
Isn't that right, Black Hitler?

06:43.905 --> 06:45.807
Your initiation...

06:45.842 --> 06:47.411
begins...

06:47.445 --> 06:48.913
now, gentlemen.

06:50.418 --> 06:51.953
Hey, guys,
I'm looking for Troy.

06:51.987 --> 06:53.456
Oh, he texted me.
He said he's fine,

06:53.490 --> 06:55.493
but he couldn't say where he is.
Oh, no, do you think

06:55.511 --> 06:57.798
he's been kidnapped?
Usually it's one of the parents,

06:57.832 --> 07:00.437
and it almost always
ends in murder-suicide.

07:00.471 --> 07:02.440
- Why are you smiling?
- I'm smiling?

07:02.474 --> 07:04.979
Well if you see him, tell him
Jerry's looking for him.

07:05.013 --> 07:07.316
So Jeff, what are you going
to wear to Pierce's gay party?

07:07.351 --> 07:09.020
- Nothing.
- Ooh, they'll love that.

07:09.038 --> 07:10.857
Ha ha.
I mean I'm not going.

07:10.875 --> 07:12.660
It's dumb and I can't believe
you guys are supporting it.

07:12.694 --> 07:14.881
Everybody, this is my father,

07:14.915 --> 07:16.401
Cornelius Hawthorne.

07:16.435 --> 07:18.272
Oh, I always assumed
your father was dead.

07:18.306 --> 07:19.741
Just mathematically.

07:19.775 --> 07:21.711
Well, mom liked to pretend
that was the case.

07:21.746 --> 07:22.847
These are your friends, Pierce?

07:22.881 --> 07:24.182
Hello.

07:24.216 --> 07:26.220
Minorities, jewesses,

07:26.254 --> 07:27.890
and the unseasonably tan?

07:27.925 --> 07:29.393
That is inappropriate!

07:29.427 --> 07:32.783
And maybe you'll give that more
weight since I'm "white".

07:32.834 --> 07:34.069
You've got a wide brow.

07:34.103 --> 07:35.773
What are you, Scandinavian?

07:35.807 --> 07:37.108
Yeah, Swedish.

07:37.143 --> 07:38.711
Swedish dogs.

07:38.745 --> 07:40.348
Your blood is tainted
by generations

07:40.382 --> 07:42.385
of race mixing with laplanders.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.356
You're basically Finns!

07:44.390 --> 07:46.493
Oh, my goodness, he's like
the Abed of racism.

07:46.528 --> 07:47.862
Okay, since no one's
willing to ask,

07:47.897 --> 07:48.998
what's going on with your hair?

07:49.032 --> 07:50.935
Ordinary toupee hair
is harvested

07:50.970 --> 07:52.939
from the heads of
the godless oriental.

07:52.974 --> 07:54.408
Solid ivory is the only way

07:54.443 --> 07:56.780
to be assured of
true follicular purity,

07:56.798 --> 07:59.318
while still identifying
myself as a man of means.

07:59.353 --> 08:03.126
I can excuse racism, but I
draw the line at animal cruelty.

08:03.160 --> 08:04.395
You can excuse racism?

08:04.429 --> 08:05.831
So what brings you here?

08:05.865 --> 08:07.534
I'm assuming it's not
for your son's party.

08:07.569 --> 08:10.207
Unless "segregationist mummy"
is a gay fetish I'm unaware of.

08:10.241 --> 08:13.196
Actually, uh, after
discussing with my father,

08:13.247 --> 08:14.832
the party's off,

08:14.866 --> 08:16.419
and we're canceling
pride wipes.

08:16.453 --> 08:17.838
Stand up straight, Piercinald,

08:17.872 --> 08:19.341
when talking
to the lower classes.

08:19.375 --> 08:20.961
Now if you'll excuse me,
I need to go find

08:20.995 --> 08:22.965
a half-decent ivory buffer

08:22.999 --> 08:25.937
in this two-horse town.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.310
Oh, the party's cancelled?

08:29.345 --> 08:30.579
I bought a cone bra.

08:30.614 --> 08:32.150
Piercinald, please tell me
you did not

08:32.183 --> 08:33.986
cancel your gay party
because of your father.

08:33.988 --> 08:35.990
It's a business decision, Jeff.

08:36.024 --> 08:38.962
I took a look at the numbers,
had someone explain them to me,

08:38.996 --> 08:40.716
and this is the way we're going.

08:40.751 --> 08:42.303
I thought you said
Pierce's idea was dumb?

08:42.337 --> 08:44.339
Well that's before it was
being oppressed by a--

08:44.375 --> 08:46.043
- A father?
- A homophobe!

08:46.061 --> 08:47.345
This isn't about fathers.

08:47.380 --> 08:49.383
This is about
a long-suffering community

08:49.417 --> 08:50.686
with a constitutional right

08:50.721 --> 08:52.790
to wipe whoever
and whatever they want.

08:52.825 --> 08:54.359
Well, if you like gay people
so much,

08:54.394 --> 08:56.080
why don't you marry them?!

08:56.114 --> 08:57.599
This is so edible.

08:57.633 --> 08:59.603
Britta, you are gonna
make a terrible therapist.

08:59.637 --> 09:01.373
And if you need to talk
to someone about that,

09:01.408 --> 09:02.542
I don't recommend you.

09:02.577 --> 09:04.413
Hmm, is that how your
dad talked to your mom?

09:04.447 --> 09:05.548
No, that's how
he talked to your mom.

09:05.582 --> 09:06.650
How does that make you feel?

09:06.685 --> 09:07.719
Shut up.

09:15.260 --> 09:17.796
Ah, Jeffrey!

09:17.831 --> 09:19.533
Ah, I was so sad
when Pierce said

09:19.567 --> 09:21.135
he was canceling the party.

09:21.170 --> 09:23.271
And I was so happy when you
said that it was back on.

09:23.289 --> 09:24.707
Yeah, he's real busy
with his dad,

09:24.742 --> 09:27.244
but I knew how much
it meant to him.

09:27.278 --> 09:28.663
I throw a pretty gay party,
huh?

09:28.714 --> 09:29.882
Yeah, it's great.

09:29.917 --> 09:31.218
I mean, if you're
into that kind of thing.

09:31.252 --> 09:32.753
Time to mingle.

09:34.757 --> 09:36.125
What the hell is this?

09:36.159 --> 09:38.011
The gay bash,
courtesy of Hawthorne Wipes.

09:38.062 --> 09:39.146
I cancelled this!

09:39.181 --> 09:40.364
And I uncancelled it.

09:40.400 --> 09:41.683
My dad's gonna disown me!

09:41.734 --> 09:43.970
Oh, no, then you'll be
free of him forever.

09:43.988 --> 09:46.140
You'll never have to cower at
the sound of his voice

09:46.158 --> 09:48.611
or shudder when
you see an elephant.

09:48.645 --> 09:49.830
You're welcome, Pierce.

09:49.864 --> 09:52.283
I just did what you
never had the guts to do.

09:52.318 --> 09:53.586
You know what?
Britta was right.

09:53.620 --> 09:54.753
You resent my father because

09:54.788 --> 09:56.339
you've got problems
with your own.

09:56.374 --> 09:58.092
After "Britta was right",
everything you said

09:58.126 --> 09:59.261
just sounded like a fog horn.

09:59.295 --> 10:01.497
Then have your big gay party.

10:01.532 --> 10:02.850
I'm out of here!

10:02.884 --> 10:04.636
Oh, come on, Pierce,
just have one drink.

10:04.670 --> 10:06.606
You're gonna want to
see the guest of honor.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.675
Pull the cord, fellas.

10:08.693 --> 10:14.567
Pierce, Pierce, Pierce!

10:14.619 --> 10:16.353
Well, maybe just one drink.

10:23.031 --> 10:24.082
Done.

10:29.074 --> 10:30.709
Mr. Barnes...

10:30.744 --> 10:32.478
Walk with me.

10:32.513 --> 10:34.382
Mr. Barnes,
air conditioning repair is

10:34.416 --> 10:36.618
an elite worldwide
family dating back

10:36.653 --> 10:38.988
to the very beginnings
of civilizations.

10:39.023 --> 10:40.824
Our predecessors were slaves,

10:40.859 --> 10:43.244
fanning the pharaohs
with palm fronds.

10:43.279 --> 10:44.914
Over time, we became expert

10:44.948 --> 10:46.733
at making our
superiors comfortable.

10:46.768 --> 10:48.336
We made it our business.

10:48.370 --> 10:53.461
And along the way, we learned
to make ourselves comfortable.

10:53.512 --> 10:56.381
No more palm fronds, Troy.

10:56.415 --> 10:59.720
Now we are the pharaohs.

11:01.090 --> 11:02.892
Breath print approved.

11:10.905 --> 11:12.506
Feel that?

11:12.541 --> 11:13.842
Actually, I don't feel--

11:13.876 --> 11:15.978
Precisely.

11:16.013 --> 11:17.848
Have you heard the expression
room temperature?

11:17.882 --> 11:18.849
Of course.

11:18.883 --> 11:21.053
This is the room!

11:21.088 --> 11:25.393
This is the
room temperature room.

11:27.397 --> 11:33.438
I-I can't tell where the air
ends and my skin begins.

11:33.473 --> 11:35.441
It's incredible.
That's what we do, Troy.

11:35.476 --> 11:38.530
Incredible, invisible,
inbelievable things.

11:38.581 --> 11:40.950
We're an unseen,
unknown, unvincible

11:40.984 --> 11:42.452
fraternity of craftsmen.

11:42.487 --> 11:46.892
Graduates of this school are
guaranteed lucrative employment

11:46.926 --> 11:48.294
for their entire lives.

11:48.328 --> 11:52.050
And I'm inviting you to join us.

11:52.101 --> 11:53.469
Will there always be paninis?

11:53.504 --> 11:57.142
There is one catch, Troy.

11:57.176 --> 11:59.612
Once you're in...

11:59.646 --> 12:01.448
You're in.

12:01.482 --> 12:03.919
Air conditioning repair
will be your life.

12:03.953 --> 12:08.159
A life of secrets you'll be
unable to share with outsiders.

12:08.193 --> 12:11.831
You will be an
air conditioning repairman

12:11.865 --> 12:14.234
and nothing else...

12:14.269 --> 12:16.972
Until the day you die.

12:19.594 --> 12:21.813
I don't expect you
to make a decision now.

12:24.585 --> 12:26.720
Take 24 hours.

12:28.324 --> 12:29.591
Cool.

12:29.625 --> 12:32.362
I can't feel my pants.

12:34.366 --> 12:37.036
Go Pierce, go Pierce,
it's your birthday!

12:37.070 --> 12:38.955
Well, congratulations,
you got Pierce

12:39.006 --> 12:42.211
to symbolically kill his father
by dancing to club music.

12:42.245 --> 12:44.347
You of all people
should be happy about this.

12:44.381 --> 12:46.517
Pierce is becoming
a more tolerant person,

12:46.552 --> 12:48.103
and it has nothing
to do with his father.

12:48.137 --> 12:49.455
Look at me now, dad!

12:49.490 --> 12:51.225
Yeah, look at me now, dad!

12:51.259 --> 12:54.129
Look at me now, dad!

12:54.164 --> 12:55.731
Look at me now, dad!

12:55.765 --> 12:57.985
- Hey, where you been?
- I'm not allowed to say.

12:58.036 --> 12:59.170
- Are you Superman?
- No.

12:59.204 --> 13:00.172
Would you tell me if you were?

13:00.206 --> 13:01.340
I'd tell everyone.

13:01.374 --> 13:02.825
I never understood
why he cared who knew.

13:02.877 --> 13:04.962
This is the hottest
party we've ever had.

13:04.996 --> 13:06.164
I know, it's pretty dope.

13:06.215 --> 13:07.967
No, I mean,
it's dangerously hot.

13:08.001 --> 13:09.336
Our air conditioning system

13:09.387 --> 13:11.005
wasn't built
for this gay a party.

13:11.056 --> 13:13.458
I'll take a look.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.296
<i>- Tron?
- What's tron?</i>

13:18.651 --> 13:20.270
Ooh!

13:20.304 --> 13:22.706
Man this party's
a real sausage fest.

13:24.493 --> 13:25.878
I knew it!

13:25.913 --> 13:28.749
- Knew what?
- Don't play dumb with me.

13:28.783 --> 13:30.485
What, did they promise you
the life of your dreams?

13:30.519 --> 13:31.820
You can have all that
as a plumber too,

13:31.855 --> 13:32.888
but without the pretense.

13:32.923 --> 13:34.124
Why do you hate them so much?

13:34.158 --> 13:35.626
Because they're elitist.

13:35.661 --> 13:37.095
They pump themselves up
to make everybody

13:37.130 --> 13:38.263
think that they're special.

13:38.298 --> 13:40.133
Because the truth is
they're not!

13:40.167 --> 13:41.535
I have a gift.

13:41.570 --> 13:43.705
I'm special.
I'm not a loser like you.

13:43.739 --> 13:45.875
I'm gonna eat Spaceman
paninis with Black Hitler,

13:45.909 --> 13:47.979
and there's nothing
you can do about it!

13:50.984 --> 13:52.886
Well, you really seem to be
enjoying yourself.

13:52.920 --> 13:56.091
I've gotta say, I don't know
why the word gay means dumb.

13:56.125 --> 13:58.077
These guys are
all right in my book.

13:58.128 --> 14:01.499
Pierce Hawthorne,
get your fine gay-lovin' ass

14:01.533 --> 14:03.586
up here and say something
to your fans.

14:03.637 --> 14:04.604
Come on!

14:07.242 --> 14:09.762
If I tell you something, will
you promise to keep it a secret?

14:09.813 --> 14:10.981
Secret handshake.

14:11.015 --> 14:12.233
Secret.

14:12.267 --> 14:13.818
Okay, I know I said
I can't talk to you

14:13.852 --> 14:15.604
about what's going on,
but I can talk to myself.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.073
Can you pretend to be me?

14:17.107 --> 14:19.226
I like football,
but also I don't--

14:19.244 --> 14:20.745
Perfect.
Okay, I can't choose between

14:20.780 --> 14:21.914
air conditioning and plumbing.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.566
I know, it's so hard, right?

14:23.584 --> 14:25.336
- Let's ask Abed.
- Now you be me.

14:25.371 --> 14:27.506
- What should I do, Abed?
- I don't know

14:27.540 --> 14:28.707
but Harrison Ford might know.

14:28.742 --> 14:30.093
Don't get cocky kid--

14:30.127 --> 14:31.679
Okay, this isn't working, okay?
Abed tell me what to do.

14:31.713 --> 14:33.131
I don't really see the dilemma.

14:33.182 --> 14:35.118
Plumbing and air conditioning
seem more or less identical.

14:35.152 --> 14:37.254
They're not--they couldn't
be more or less identical.

14:37.272 --> 14:39.591
Well, what do you
feel like doing?

14:39.625 --> 14:41.894
Honestly, I el like
watching TV with you.

14:41.929 --> 14:43.697
But they're making me choose,
and if I choose wrong

14:43.731 --> 14:45.483
it could screw up my whole life.

14:45.534 --> 14:47.036
If you really have to make
a decision,

14:47.070 --> 14:48.604
I say go with whatever
makes you the happiest.

14:48.622 --> 14:50.574
Because, again, they're
virtually the same thing.

14:50.608 --> 14:51.993
I think I know what I need to do.

14:52.045 --> 14:53.246
Don't get cocky, kid.

14:53.280 --> 14:54.681
All right, bitches!

14:55.950 --> 15:00.222
I just want to say
this whole thing...

15:03.128 --> 15:05.597
was a huge mistake.

15:05.631 --> 15:08.903
Uh, Hawthorne Wipes
is officially

15:08.937 --> 15:10.939
severing its ties
to the gay community.

15:10.973 --> 15:12.525
- Aw!
- What?

15:12.576 --> 15:14.328
Effective immediately,
it will return

15:14.362 --> 15:16.448
to being a straights-only
product.

15:16.482 --> 15:18.317
Boo!

15:23.960 --> 15:26.630
Ahhhhhh...

15:28.835 --> 15:31.471
Fake heart attack.

15:31.505 --> 15:33.056
I taught him
everything he knows.

15:33.108 --> 15:36.345
So, how long you guys
been on the force?

15:40.481 --> 15:41.517
Pierce!

15:42.005 --> 15:43.272
What the hell was that?

15:43.306 --> 15:44.872
- That was--
- That was my boy.

15:44.907 --> 15:47.175
Standing up for good old
Hawthorne values.

15:47.208 --> 15:49.543
All due respect, sir,
I have zero respect for you.

15:49.577 --> 15:51.977
- Typical Welsh nonsense.
- But father, I--

15:52.012 --> 15:53.412
Pierce, you really wanna
be like this guy?

15:53.447 --> 15:55.013
He's wearing
elephant bones on his head.

15:55.047 --> 15:57.915
He will be what I tell him
to be because I am his father!

16:00.351 --> 16:02.151
Listen up,
colonel crypt-keeper.

16:02.186 --> 16:04.703
I could live a million years and
I could spend every minute of it

16:04.737 --> 16:06.088
doing important things.

16:06.122 --> 16:07.205
But at the end of it all,

16:07.240 --> 16:08.572
I would have only lived
half a life

16:08.623 --> 16:10.357
if I had not raised a son.

16:10.392 --> 16:11.825
This was a gift
that was handed to you.

16:11.859 --> 16:13.359
You squandered it.

16:13.394 --> 16:15.244
And the reason you have
so much hatred in your heart

16:15.295 --> 16:16.662
is because you're
trying to fill a hole

16:16.696 --> 16:18.196
where your kid
was supposed to go.

16:18.214 --> 16:19.997
And now it's too late.

16:20.032 --> 16:22.699
Now you're just stomping around
trying to prove you exist.

16:22.717 --> 16:25.235
Well, mission accomplished.

16:25.268 --> 16:27.837
But here's a question
I'd like to pass on to you

16:27.871 --> 16:31.139
from every son of every
crap dad that ever lived.

16:31.173 --> 16:34.074
So what?

16:35.410 --> 16:37.176
I'm done with you.

16:37.210 --> 16:38.678
He's done with you.

16:38.712 --> 16:40.745
The world is done with you.

16:48.752 --> 16:50.886
Come on in.
He's a Hawthorne.

16:50.920 --> 16:52.254
This is what they do.

16:52.288 --> 16:53.521
He's faking.

17:04.630 --> 17:06.330
Pierce, listen,
I just want to say--

17:06.365 --> 17:08.866
Did you know that the Canadian
Mallard is the only water fowl

17:08.900 --> 17:11.032
that bites his father's head off
on the way out of the womb?

17:11.068 --> 17:13.402
- That is definitely not true.
- I don't know.

17:13.420 --> 17:16.003
I looked it up on
the "wackapeediah"

17:17.506 --> 17:24.076
Pierce, um, I just want
to say, you know...

17:24.109 --> 17:25.444
Sorry for killing your dad.

17:25.478 --> 17:26.845
Don't blame yourself.

17:26.880 --> 17:30.181
He bought a lot of his organs
from questionable sources.

17:30.215 --> 17:32.465
Oh, here, he wanted you
to have this.

17:32.517 --> 17:33.850
No Pierce, you should take it.

17:33.885 --> 17:35.017
Believe me, I'd love it.

17:35.051 --> 17:36.952
But the terms of his will
clearly state

17:36.987 --> 17:38.987
that whoever kills him
gets to keep it.

17:45.492 --> 17:46.759
Huh, I guess I'm up.

17:55.282 --> 17:57.233
"Father, I'll never forget
what you said to me

17:57.268 --> 18:00.002
"on my first day of school.

18:00.036 --> 18:01.270
'Comb your hair, you idiot.

18:01.304 --> 18:03.471
You look Greek.'

18:03.505 --> 18:04.972
"I'll never know
if that was true,

18:05.007 --> 18:09.441
"but I do know that I was too
scared to stand up for myself.

18:09.459 --> 18:12.544
"Well, I'm not scared of you
anymore because you're dead,

18:12.578 --> 18:14.512
"and I'm not.

18:14.547 --> 18:17.548
So, I win."

18:17.582 --> 18:19.115
And you can suck it.

18:19.133 --> 18:22.318
Dude just told
his dead dad to suck it.

18:22.352 --> 18:23.818
So edible.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.154
You're the worst.

18:44.851 --> 18:46.635
Your 24 hours has expired.

18:46.653 --> 18:48.269
I need an answer, Troy.

18:48.304 --> 18:49.971
Are you ready to join
the elite brotherhood

18:50.005 --> 18:51.905
of guys who
fix air conditioners?

18:51.940 --> 18:53.473
I'm sorry, Vice Dean Laybourne,

18:53.508 --> 18:56.509
but, I realize no one's
better than anyone else.

18:56.543 --> 18:58.476
I mean, some people
are better at sports and...

18:58.511 --> 19:01.345
And there are magicians, but...

19:01.379 --> 19:03.847
I was put on this earth
to do something else.

19:03.882 --> 19:05.715
So you're going to be what?

19:05.749 --> 19:07.116
A plumber?

19:07.151 --> 19:10.452
No, I'm not gonna be
a plumber either.

19:10.486 --> 19:13.087
Because they have
to deal with poop.

19:13.121 --> 19:15.455
My decision for now
is to watch TV with my friend.

19:15.489 --> 19:17.457
You're making
a huge mistake, son.

19:17.491 --> 19:20.693
That may be, sir.
But at least it's my mistake.

19:20.727 --> 19:22.460
It doesn't change
the fact that it's a mistake.

19:22.494 --> 19:25.128
Doesn't it?

19:25.163 --> 19:27.164
No, it doesn't.

19:35.137 --> 19:36.904
Sir, looks like there
was a malfunction

19:36.938 --> 19:38.205
in the cafeteria last night.

19:38.240 --> 19:41.874
The Amana 5000 had
a compound coil fracture.

19:41.909 --> 19:43.575
But it was fixed.

19:43.610 --> 19:46.077
Very funny.

19:46.111 --> 19:51.414
Not even I can fix a compound
coil fracture overnight.

19:51.449 --> 19:52.682
But he can.

19:52.700 --> 19:53.682
Constable Reggie.

19:53.717 --> 19:56.184
Inspector Spacetime.

19:56.202 --> 19:59.621
This isn't over, Troy Barnes.

19:59.655 --> 20:02.422
It's only just begun.

20:02.457 --> 20:04.040
You know what, I was wrong.

20:04.074 --> 20:05.708
I think you'll make
a very good therapist.

20:05.742 --> 20:07.358
And why is that?

20:07.376 --> 20:09.928
Well, you really nailed Pierce
in that whole oedipal thing.

20:09.962 --> 20:12.029
The guy's got some
serious father issues.

20:12.063 --> 20:14.998
Don't you think you may have
had some oedipal issues as well?

20:15.032 --> 20:16.266
Not really seeing
the connection.

20:16.300 --> 20:18.066
You literally killed a father.

20:18.101 --> 20:20.052
Yeah, well, not mine, dummy.

20:20.086 --> 20:21.085
Wow.

20:26.073 --> 20:29.041
Hey, Winger.
You going home alone?

20:29.059 --> 20:31.209
Gay.

20:40.736 --> 20:42.061
That was close,
Constable Reggie.

20:42.095 --> 20:44.169
I thought those blorgons
had us dead to rights.

20:44.203 --> 20:46.582
What on bitter earth do they
want from us, inspector?

20:46.617 --> 20:48.724
The question's not what they
want from us, constable.

20:48.759 --> 20:49.744
But when!

20:49.779 --> 20:52.209
Inspector, look out, blorgons!

20:52.243 --> 20:54.622
Eradicate!
Eradicate!

20:54.674 --> 20:57.121
Eradicate...Eradicate...

20:59.094 --> 21:00.963
Take that, blorgon scum.

21:00.998 --> 21:02.289
How old are you guys?

21:02.323 --> 21:05.144
The question isn't
how old we are...

21:05.179 --> 21:07.592
But when old we are!

21:09.633 --> 21:11.587
In your face, blorgonian!

21:11.622 --> 21:15.071
Pew, pew, pew, pew!

21:17.707 --> 21:20.120
'Sup, girl?

21:20.172 --> 21:21.804
How you livin'?
Pew!

21:21.824 --> 21:23.208
