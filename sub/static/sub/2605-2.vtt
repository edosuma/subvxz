WEBVTT

02:04.249 --> 02:05.792
Tess Westin, AP.

02:07.878 --> 02:08.920
Yes.

02:09.254 --> 02:10.630
Gary Cooper.

02:10.756 --> 02:12.173
Can that really be his name?

02:12.966 --> 02:14.550
Yes. Desk producer.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.304
Tamara Hart, AP.

02:19.723 --> 02:20.723
I'm on fire.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.814
New neighbors.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.193
Okay.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.501
- Morning.
- Big day.

02:48.585 --> 02:49.919
Can I talk to you a second?

02:50.003 --> 02:51.754
- We've got a rundown meeting.
- Yeah.

02:53.215 --> 02:54.841
- They're very young out there.
- I know.

02:54.967 --> 02:59.011
But what they lack in experience,
they make up for in inexperience.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.137
- Mac...
- It's an asset.

03:00.222 --> 03:01.681
They don't know
how to do the news badly yet.

03:01.765 --> 03:02.807
Or really at all.

03:02.891 --> 03:04.600
Some of them will be doing things
they haven't done before,

03:04.685 --> 03:07.103
but they'll be supervised.
I want to grow these people,

03:07.187 --> 03:08.354
so you're going to go easy on them.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.857
We talked about this last night,
and for three hours the night before

03:10.941 --> 03:12.775
and again at 4:00 a.m. This morning.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.360
And you're sure
you don't wanna lead with the spill?

03:14.444 --> 03:17.196
- I am. Is that what you wanted to talk about?
- No.

03:17.281 --> 03:20.283
I think most people here know
that you and I were together a while ago.

03:21.451 --> 03:22.994
- I think so, too.
- I don't want anyone to know

03:23.078 --> 03:24.370
- why we're not together now.
- Sure.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.205
- I mean no one.
- You think I'm gonna talk about it?

03:26.290 --> 03:27.915
I find it hard to predict
what you will and won't do.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.001
- I won't be telling anyone.
- As long as we're straight.

03:30.085 --> 03:31.836
- We are.
- No one. Nothing.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.629
Just to be clear, you want me

03:33.714 --> 03:36.090
- to tell some people, but not everyone.
- Let's go.

03:36.174 --> 03:39.135
You're going to have nine minutes
with Jan Brewer, nine minutes with La Raza.

03:39.303 --> 03:41.429
I wanna go on record saying
we should open with the spill.

03:41.513 --> 03:43.139
- Done.
- We'll open with the spill?

03:43.223 --> 03:45.057
No, but you're on record
saying you think we should.

03:45.142 --> 03:46.517
The spill is all anyone's talking about.

03:46.602 --> 03:48.019
Because we're the ones telling them to.

03:48.103 --> 03:50.438
We're still reporting on it, just not at the top.

03:50.522 --> 03:53.524
I'm looking at film
of an oil rig sinking into the ocean.

03:53.609 --> 03:54.609
That's pretty good television.

03:54.693 --> 03:57.612
We don't do good television, we do the news.

03:59.656 --> 04:00.740
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

04:00.824 --> 04:04.827
And welcome to the first pitch meeting
of News Night 2.0.

04:05.329 --> 04:09.290
The chaos of the spill is settling down,
and we get to do our first real show.

04:09.374 --> 04:10.917
11:00, I hear the pitches,

04:11.001 --> 04:13.002
4:00, the show starts to look like the show,

04:13.086 --> 04:14.420
and 6:00, we lock it in.

04:14.546 --> 04:15.880
I learned everyone's names last night.

04:16.048 --> 04:17.715
A huge step
in the right direction.

04:17.799 --> 04:21.928
We'll be opening tonight with SB 1070,
the Arizona immigration bill,

04:22.346 --> 04:23.804
which Will supports, by the way.

04:23.889 --> 04:26.557
You all thought he was a closet liberal
when, really, he's a closet moron.

04:26.642 --> 04:29.268
I'm not a closet anything.
Seriously, I know everyone's name.

04:29.353 --> 04:32.271
I was up half the night
learning to pronounce Calanasia Zbrezniak.

04:32.522 --> 04:33.689
Cally doesn't work here anymore.

04:34.650 --> 04:36.943
- Dianastasia Jorma?
- Nope.

04:37.027 --> 04:39.111
Mohammed al Mohammed
el Mohammed bin Bazir?

04:39.196 --> 04:40.237
Went to Fox.

04:40.322 --> 04:42.281
Fox hired someone
with three Mohammeds in their name?

04:42.366 --> 04:44.116
But let's give him a hand for effort.

04:44.201 --> 04:46.035
Shut up!

04:46.453 --> 04:48.329
- Is your name really Gary Cooper?
- Yeah.

04:48.413 --> 04:51.207
What is News Night 2.0?

04:51.333 --> 04:52.959
- This is...
- Mac, the...

04:53.043 --> 04:54.543
Right, thank you.

04:54.711 --> 04:55.795
Before we get to 2.0,

04:55.879 --> 04:59.256
I'm supposed to read something from IT,
and I don't want to forget.

04:59.508 --> 05:02.385
"New aliases have been set up
for in-house e-mails.

05:02.469 --> 05:05.388
"Autocomplete has been enabled
on your Outlook."

05:07.391 --> 05:08.391
Anybody know what that meant?

05:10.477 --> 05:11.560
Right.

05:11.770 --> 05:16.440
"Asterisk-interns" or "asterisk-staff,"
an asterisk makes it go to a group.

05:16.525 --> 05:18.025
No asterisk makes it go to an individual.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.986
Your name is Neelamani Sampat.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.362
- Nailed it.
- Neal's fine.

05:21.446 --> 05:22.738
Can you say it one more time?

05:22.823 --> 05:24.407
Just type an e-mail to someone.

05:24.574 --> 05:28.285
Okay, I'm sending an e-mail to Will.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.204
I'm typing it.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.790
- I'm still typing it.
- What are you doing now?

05:32.874 --> 05:34.083
Still typing.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.085
And I'm sending it.

05:42.968 --> 05:44.593
It's all right. You made two mistakes.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.053
You used an asterisk,

05:46.138 --> 05:48.848
and instead of typing "W" for "Will,"
you typed "S" for "staff."

05:48.932 --> 05:50.307
They're close together on the keyboard.

05:50.392 --> 05:52.351
"Will McAvoy's a closet bigot
who hates immigrants,

05:52.436 --> 05:54.228
"even though this country
was founded by immigrants."

05:54.312 --> 05:55.813
- Everybody get the same thing?
- Yep.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.273
No one in this newsroom's job

05:57.357 --> 05:59.150
is being threatened
by an undocumented worker.

05:59.276 --> 06:02.361
Here we go. This is News Night 2.0.

06:02.446 --> 06:03.863
Sorry!

06:07.909 --> 06:09.702
- Excuse me, Charlie?
- Yeah.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.037
You wanted to see me?

06:11.121 --> 06:12.538
A 12-year-old kid in Topeka

06:12.622 --> 06:15.041
is trying to convince me
he's got a pair of jacks in the hole.

06:15.125 --> 06:17.209
- Shouldn't he be in school?
- He is in school.

06:17.294 --> 06:18.627
- How can I help you?
- Hang on.

06:20.338 --> 06:22.631
He really did have jacks in the hole.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.092
Is there a way I can tell his parents?

06:25.177 --> 06:26.969
- I'm a little busy.
- Sure.

06:27.804 --> 06:31.307
You know how you have a secret meeting
with Will every day to talk about numbers?

06:32.017 --> 06:34.560
- I... We don't have a secret meeting.
- Yeah, you do.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.854
You meet with him in private
and you tell him exactly...

06:36.938 --> 06:37.980
I do it at his request.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.607
- It's very instructive.
- It is.

06:39.691 --> 06:40.775
- It's invaluable.
- Yeah.

06:40.859 --> 06:42.109
I want you to stop.

06:42.194 --> 06:44.153
Don't break down the numbers
for him for a little while.

06:44.654 --> 06:45.863
Can I ask why?

06:45.947 --> 06:49.325
We're trying something new,
and I don't want him getting cold feet.

06:49.493 --> 06:50.868
- He listens to you.
- He should.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.286
But what do you mean
you're trying something new?

06:52.370 --> 06:54.497
We're going to try doing the news,
and see what happens.

06:55.332 --> 06:56.373
I don't get it.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.793
There are two important conversations,

06:59.044 --> 07:00.711
how do we do the best news possible,

07:00.796 --> 07:02.630
and how do we get the most people to watch?

07:02.714 --> 07:05.841
I don't want one of those conversations
to have anything to do with the other...

07:05.926 --> 07:07.760
You don't want ratings to drive content.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.178
- Exactly.
- Neither do I.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.764
- I want content to drive ratings.
- That's the hope.

07:11.848 --> 07:14.225
But for the moment,
I don't want ratings in Will's head at all.

07:14.309 --> 07:17.311
I'd be able to tell him
you spiked close to 75,000 new viewers

07:17.395 --> 07:18.437
since you broke your story.

07:18.522 --> 07:20.272
- That's 10% in four days.
- Yeah.

07:20.357 --> 07:23.109
In addition to the haul he brought in
after he went crazy at Northwestern.

07:23.193 --> 07:24.443
- He didn't go crazy.
- I'd be able to tell him

07:24.528 --> 07:26.362
that 32% of those are in the demo...

07:26.446 --> 07:29.073
- Reese.
- And 44% make over 75K,

07:29.157 --> 07:31.617
which means we can charge more
for 15 and 30s

07:31.701 --> 07:33.119
and get out
of the wheelchair-selling business.

07:33.203 --> 07:34.703
And what does he do with that information?

07:34.788 --> 07:36.622
He stretches out the spill as long as he can.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.291
- That's ratings driving content.
- That's just reality.

07:39.376 --> 07:41.627
- Reese.
- No, I need to be able to do my job.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.963
Just don't break down the numbers for Will.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.717
We've never gotten along that well, have we?

07:48.802 --> 07:52.054
Reese, don't break down the numbers for Will.

07:53.390 --> 07:56.475
If I hid in a locked vault
buried under the AWM building,

07:56.560 --> 07:59.311
Will would find me
so I could break down the numbers for him,

07:59.396 --> 08:01.981
because Will McAvoy is
the biggest ratings whore in the business.

08:02.065 --> 08:03.858
- I'm not the bad guy.
- Nobody's the bad guy.

08:03.942 --> 08:06.193
Though if you call Will a whore again,

08:06.278 --> 08:10.030
I'm going to take out your teeth
one punch at a time.

08:10.574 --> 08:12.074
- Anything else?
- No, sir.

08:14.661 --> 08:17.746
This is a new show and there are new rules.

08:18.248 --> 08:22.543
One, "Is this information
we need in the voting booth?"

08:22.627 --> 08:26.881
Two, "Is this the best possible form
of the argument?"

08:27.591 --> 08:31.510
And three, "Is the story in historical context?"

08:31.887 --> 08:34.054
You can use a mnemonic device.

08:34.264 --> 08:37.850
I, I, I, the three "I's."

08:38.185 --> 08:39.810
- That's not really helpful.
- I was gonna say.

08:39.895 --> 08:40.936
We're not opening with BP?

08:41.021 --> 08:42.771
It'll go down in the D block.
There's nothing new.

08:42.898 --> 08:45.566
How about today's day four
of the president not saying anything about it?

08:45.650 --> 08:49.028
Would you get off the man's back?
Jesus Christ, I'm surprised you found room.

08:49.112 --> 08:50.362
Gary, Kendra.

08:50.447 --> 08:53.073
Gary is the smart black guy
who's not afraid to criticize Obama.

08:53.158 --> 08:56.994
Kendra got double 800s on her SATs,
makes Gary crazy. I studied.

08:57.162 --> 08:59.330
BP's going in the D block. Jim.

08:59.414 --> 09:03.876
SB 1070 passed the Arizona House last week,
and a few days later, passed the State Senate.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.211
Its official name is

09:05.295 --> 09:08.631
the "Support Our Law Enforcement
and Safe Neighborhoods Act."

09:08.715 --> 09:12.259
It requires immigrants carry their
alien registration documents at all times,

09:12.344 --> 09:14.720
requires police question people
if there's reason to suspect

09:14.804 --> 09:16.472
they're in the United States illegally,

09:16.556 --> 09:18.557
and it targets those
who hire illegal immigrants.

09:18.642 --> 09:19.934
The governor signs the bill today.

09:20.018 --> 09:22.394
Is it worth mentioning this is the same state
that offered a bill

09:22.479 --> 09:25.356
requiring presidential candidates to show
their birth certificates

09:25.440 --> 09:26.565
in order to get on the ballot?

09:26.650 --> 09:28.400
In a courtroom,
that would be called "prejudicial."

09:28.485 --> 09:29.693
It would be called prejudicial anywhere.

09:29.778 --> 09:31.195
Nope, not that kind of prejudicial.

09:31.363 --> 09:33.364
We've got the governor for nine minutes.

09:33.448 --> 09:35.908
- Just us. She's only talking to Will.
- How'd you swing that?

09:35.992 --> 09:37.826
By telling her about News Night 2.0.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.036
You showed her the easel?

09:39.120 --> 09:42.164
I convinced her she's not going to have
to outshout a crazy person.

09:42.624 --> 09:45.334
That studio is a courtroom,

09:45.418 --> 09:48.504
and we only call expert witnesses.

09:48.630 --> 09:50.965
Will is the attorney for both sides.

09:51.049 --> 09:54.176
He examines the witness and reveals facts.

09:54.928 --> 10:00.224
You will be amazed at the guests we'll book
using that unbelievably obvious template.

10:00.684 --> 10:01.767
You don't have to raise your hand.

10:01.851 --> 10:04.311
I saw one of those crazy militia guys
on Jon Stewart last night.

10:04.396 --> 10:05.437
We could also have him on.

10:05.522 --> 10:07.106
Did you hear me
when I was speaking just then

10:07.190 --> 10:08.774
or were you distracted by a bumblebee?

10:09.359 --> 10:11.652
What does the "l" stand for?

10:15.865 --> 10:17.157
The second "I."

10:17.284 --> 10:19.952
"Is this the best possible
form of the argument?"

10:20.036 --> 10:21.829
Not the most colorful version,

10:21.913 --> 10:23.789
not the most outrageous version,

10:23.873 --> 10:26.166
but the best possible version.

10:26.251 --> 10:28.627
- How do you define "best"?
- I define it by the source.

10:28.878 --> 10:31.463
I define it by the number
of relevant facts it contains,

10:31.548 --> 10:35.551
and I define it by an X factor
that I trust Will and myself to determine,

10:35.719 --> 10:37.761
using our combined five decades in the field.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.722
What's the best possible version
of the "birther" argument?

10:39.806 --> 10:42.141
There isn't one. And that's the fourth. Ah!

10:42.392 --> 10:43.892
This one's an "A."

10:43.977 --> 10:46.186
Are there really two sides to this story?

10:46.271 --> 10:49.398
So it's l-l-l-A.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.358
What does that mean, "Are there really..."

10:51.443 --> 10:54.945
The media is biased towards success,
and the media is biased towards fairness.

10:55.071 --> 10:56.488
How can you be biased toward fairness?

10:56.573 --> 10:58.365
There aren't two sides to every story.

10:58.450 --> 11:01.035
Some stories have five sides,
some only have one.

11:01.119 --> 11:03.078
- You don't have to raise your hand.
- I still don't under...

11:03.163 --> 11:04.163
Biased toward fairness means

11:04.247 --> 11:06.081
that if the entire
Congressional Republican Caucus

11:06.166 --> 11:08.042
were to walk into the House
and propose a resolution

11:08.126 --> 11:10.502
stating that the Earth was flat,
the Times would lead with,

11:10.587 --> 11:12.796
"Democrats and Republicans
Can't Agree on Shape of Earth."

11:12.881 --> 11:14.089
Uh...

11:14.174 --> 11:15.507
Mac?

11:15.592 --> 11:17.593
- Would you let them raise their hands?
- Fine.

11:17.761 --> 11:19.678
- Back to immigration.
- Neelamani Sampat.

11:19.763 --> 11:21.847
- It means blue jewel.
- I didn't know that.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.515
I did. I took the time. I care.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.558
Are you asking him out?

11:24.642 --> 11:26.560
If he wants me to. I'm nice.

11:26.728 --> 11:28.437
- And what are you still doing here?
- I was asked to help.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.898
Don generously volunteered
to help during the transition.

11:30.982 --> 11:32.983
- He was asked or he volunteered?
- I'm happy to go.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.360
- Apologize.
- I'm sorry.

11:34.444 --> 11:35.611
- To Don.
- I'm over it.

11:36.613 --> 11:39.156
- Neal.
- There is an alternative weekly in Spokane

11:39.657 --> 11:41.617
called the Pacific Northwest Insider

11:41.826 --> 11:44.536
that published an article about immigration
a couple of weeks ago.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.872
The story featured a guy named Hector Nunez

11:46.956 --> 11:49.083
who revealed that when he was 16,

11:49.167 --> 11:51.126
his parents told him
that he was living here illegally.

11:51.294 --> 11:52.461
The paper used his real name?

11:52.629 --> 11:56.548
Yeah, and the state of Washington rescinded
his driver's license after the piece came out.

11:57.300 --> 12:00.719
He needs his car to get
to his job with a small moving company

12:00.804 --> 12:03.055
and to take his kids to school in the morning.

12:03.181 --> 12:06.308
- I thought we could have him on.
- I've got to budget 42 minutes.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.894
I've already spent 18
on Jan Brewer and La Raza.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.813
I thought we could put
a human face on immigration.

12:10.897 --> 12:13.107
How about putting a human face
on the guy whose job he took?

12:13.316 --> 12:14.483
We don't have the time.

12:14.984 --> 12:17.277
We've got 1070, BP and a senate candidate

12:17.362 --> 12:19.279
who says poor people
can pay doctors with chickens.

12:19.364 --> 12:21.740
But even if we did have the time,
it would be emotionally manipulative.

12:21.825 --> 12:23.158
- How?
- We'd be putting him there

12:23.243 --> 12:24.493
so that we can feel sorry for him.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.245
We should feel sorry for him.
He's getting screwed.

12:26.371 --> 12:27.871
You should feel sorry
for the guy whose job he took.

12:27.956 --> 12:29.790
I don't want to feel sorry for anybody.

12:29.874 --> 12:33.252
I want the facts, and neither of them
can provide facts.

12:33.336 --> 12:35.129
- Somebody's gonna book this kid.
- Nobody's gonna book him.

12:35.213 --> 12:37.840
Nobody's gonna have heard of him.
It's an alternative weekly in Spokane.

12:37.966 --> 12:38.966
And do you see,

12:39.050 --> 12:41.427
"What's our competition doing," on the easel?

12:41.511 --> 12:43.345
- No, but I wish I did.
- Moving on.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.100
The Dow has ticked down 108 points

12:48.184 --> 12:50.269
on a surprisingly
weak durable-goods orders report

12:50.353 --> 12:52.187
from the Commerce Department
that has raised worries...

12:52.272 --> 12:55.357
Listen, I'm not gonna take it
from him in public or private.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.276
- I'm doing you guys a favor.
- I'm sorry.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.861
I understand and he knows that.

12:59.028 --> 13:00.654
You're cutting PopWatch
and Today on YouTube?

13:00.738 --> 13:03.031
I am and I know they're both yours, but...

13:03.116 --> 13:04.241
I don't care that they're mine.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.285
I care that they're the most
popular segments on the show.

13:06.369 --> 13:07.453
Look at the minute to minutes.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.246
Feel free to use them
when you and Elliot start at 10:00.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.832
Yeah, there's gonna be nobody left at 10:00
if you lead off the night with

13:11.916 --> 13:13.375
the "Will McAvoy Makes You
Eat Your Vegetables Hour."

13:15.462 --> 13:16.462
Hmm?

13:17.088 --> 13:18.297
Forget it.

13:20.675 --> 13:21.675
- Maggie.
- Yeah.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.844
Mac wants me to supervise
your pre-interview with Brewer's office.

13:23.928 --> 13:24.970
- I was told.
- All right,

13:25.054 --> 13:26.972
you're gonna be talking to a spokesperson.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.307
I'll call him now.

13:28.391 --> 13:30.392
I thought maybe we could do
a practice run first.

13:30.602 --> 13:33.145
Okay, I'd like to say, with all respect,

13:33.229 --> 13:35.314
that I don't feel I need to be supervised.

13:35.398 --> 13:37.149
- Okay.
- You'll let me do it by myself?

13:37.817 --> 13:39.818
No, I just meant, okay, I heard you say that.

13:39.903 --> 13:42.154
I've been here a year.
You've been here three days.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.280
Mac's working with a group

13:43.364 --> 13:45.073
of relatively inexperienced people
she doesn't know.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.241
- I know that.
- All right.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.076
- So you'll let me do it myself?
- No.

13:48.453 --> 13:50.704
- Then I'm doing this under protest.
- I'm sorry?

13:50.788 --> 13:53.665
I'm just... I'll be...
I'm doing this under protest.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.334
- What does that look like?
- It'll be the same.

13:55.418 --> 13:57.169
I'm just lodging an official protest.

13:57.295 --> 13:59.338
- With who?
- My immediate superior, I guess.

13:59.422 --> 14:00.672
That's me.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.257
- Well, are you writing it down?
- No.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.800
Are you really considering going to 10:00?

14:04.302 --> 14:06.762
- Don made some compelling arguments.
- Yeah? What were they?

14:06.846 --> 14:09.640
That growing something from scratch
is something I should experience.

14:09.933 --> 14:12.476
- Okay.
- Whoa, whoa, wait.

14:12.560 --> 14:13.727
- What did that mean?
- Nothing.

14:13.811 --> 14:14.853
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:14.938 --> 14:16.396
I know exactly what you're thinking.

14:16.481 --> 14:18.023
I can't say the same.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.483
You don't think
I'm making a relationship choice?

14:19.567 --> 14:21.818
- No.
- That this is just a temp gig for me

14:21.903 --> 14:25.113
until someone puts a ring on it
and I can have kids?

14:25.240 --> 14:27.032
I wasn't saying... I didn't say any of that.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.910
You don't think that I don't have
the same commitment to news that you do?

14:29.994 --> 14:31.119
No.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.456
I'll be honest because of the way
I phrased those questions,

14:34.541 --> 14:36.542
I wasn't totally clear
on what your answers meant.

14:36.626 --> 14:39.545
I think that you have the same commitment
to the news that I do.

14:39.754 --> 14:41.630
I think kids are great. I used to be one.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.215
And I can't remember the third thing, but...

14:43.299 --> 14:44.591
- Ring, ring.
- Thank you.

14:44.676 --> 14:46.260
- Ring, ring.
- Hi, it's Glenn Fisher.

14:46.344 --> 14:47.553
- Glenn Fisher?
- Yes.

14:47.637 --> 14:49.555
- That's the spokesperson I'm talking to?
- Yes.

14:49.639 --> 14:50.681
I thought it was John Markell.

14:50.765 --> 14:52.432
Fisher's a press agent
who's doing the pre-interview.

14:53.184 --> 14:54.476
Okay.

14:54.811 --> 14:57.229
First, you go into iNEWS
and you look over the questions

14:57.313 --> 14:58.855
the segment producer put in the rundown.

14:58.940 --> 15:02.067
Identify yourself and your news agency,
summarize the segment,

15:02.151 --> 15:03.485
the length, whether it's live or not,

15:03.570 --> 15:05.153
and who we're having on from the other side.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.740
I'm sorry, but don't I first open my eyes
and notice it's a new day?

15:08.825 --> 15:10.450
- What are we talking about here?
- I've done this before.

15:10.535 --> 15:13.245
- Okay.
- What is this magic box in front of me?

15:13.329 --> 15:14.413
Have I done something to you?

15:14.497 --> 15:16.373
I swear I was just thinking
the exact same thing.

15:16.457 --> 15:18.041
I have no idea why I'm being mean to you.

15:18.126 --> 15:19.376
Now that you know that,
do you think you'll stop?

15:19.460 --> 15:21.378
That's the thing, it doesn't feel like it.

15:21.462 --> 15:22.462
I'm just being honest.

15:22.547 --> 15:24.256
I can't ask for more than that,
except rational thought.

15:24.340 --> 15:25.841
- What was that?
- Nothing.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.551
- Ring, ring.
- Hi, it's Glenn Fisher.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.344
Glenn, this is Margaret Jordan.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.096
I'm an associate producer at News Night,

15:31.180 --> 15:34.099
and I'm doing the pre-interview
for the governor's appearance this evening.

15:34.183 --> 15:37.060
I know Will's gonna wanna ask
why mean people

15:37.145 --> 15:39.479
tend to pour into your state
like it's a bathtub drain.

15:39.564 --> 15:40.647
Will's not gonna wanna ask that.

15:40.732 --> 15:43.442
I think they're building the fence
on the wrong side of the state.

15:43.526 --> 15:45.027
Margaret, here in Arizona,

15:45.111 --> 15:47.821
the government can barely pay
for the needs of native-born poor as it is,

15:47.905 --> 15:49.531
welfare, education, Social Security,

15:49.616 --> 15:51.491
especially when so many households here

15:51.576 --> 15:53.368
are one or two paychecks away
from the poverty line.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.620
You're scapegoating these people.

15:54.704 --> 15:57.456
Stop. I just said illegals cost money.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.374
- Ask the follow-up.
- Okay.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.044
Ask it.

16:03.338 --> 16:05.380
My follow-up, Mr. Fisher, is this.

16:06.007 --> 16:08.467
I understand
that having undocumented workers

16:08.551 --> 16:09.760
living in the US costs money,

16:09.844 --> 16:11.803
and it's a problem
we have to do something about,

16:12.347 --> 16:14.139
but shouldn't it be a point of pride
for Americans

16:14.223 --> 16:17.309
that others are willing to uproot their families
just to come here?

16:17.602 --> 16:19.394
The follow-up was, "How much do they cost?"

16:19.479 --> 16:22.105
But, yes, it is a point of pride
that people wanna come to America,

16:22.190 --> 16:24.149
and we value our diverse
population in Arizona,

16:24.233 --> 16:26.693
but we just want people to immigrate legally
and become citizens.

16:26.778 --> 16:29.529
And I'm sure that's what's behind
the emotion and the vitriol.

16:29.614 --> 16:31.865
Americans hate it when people
don't fill out the proper paperwork.

16:32.033 --> 16:33.033
You can't antagonize the...

16:33.117 --> 16:35.661
I'm gonna ask the right questions, you dweeb.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.663
- And you'll follow up?
- I'll follow up.

16:37.747 --> 16:40.791
My point is that whatever side
of this you're on,

16:41.709 --> 16:44.169
the rhetoric we use to talk about these people

16:44.253 --> 16:46.755
who risk their lives
to have a shot at picking oranges

16:46.839 --> 16:48.924
so their kids have a shot at not being dead

16:49.008 --> 16:52.803
makes it sound like we're talking about
scraping gum off our shoes.

16:53.930 --> 16:57.933
These people chose to take a huge risk
to become Americans,

16:58.017 --> 17:00.435
and they deserve a better descriptor
than "illegals."

17:08.152 --> 17:09.611
You don't need me. You got this one.

17:10.446 --> 17:11.571
Thank you.

17:11.656 --> 17:14.366
Another story making headlines
this morning is, of course, Greece,

17:14.450 --> 17:16.702
whose prime minister
officially requested activation

17:16.786 --> 17:18.787
of the EU/IMF bailout package,

17:18.871 --> 17:20.706
lifting the euro
from its lowest level of the year

17:20.790 --> 17:22.541
and sending commodity prices soaring.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.459
We'll have that and the rest
of the day's financial news

17:24.544 --> 17:26.128
on Market Wrap-Up at 4:00.

17:26.212 --> 17:27.379
I'm Sloan Sabbith.

17:27.463 --> 17:30.048
Let's go out to Diane
and Billy on the west coast

17:30.133 --> 17:31.633
for Atlantis Hollywood.

17:32.009 --> 17:33.135
And we're clear.

17:35.805 --> 17:38.390
- Hello.
- Sloan, I'm MacKenzie McHale.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.475
- I know. It's good to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.769
- Do you have a minute?
- Sure. Thanks.

17:45.398 --> 17:46.940
You know, I was watching you earlier

17:47.024 --> 17:50.360
when you were talking about two companies,
Capital One and...

17:50.445 --> 17:51.570
- Baxter.
- Baxter.

17:51.654 --> 17:54.406
And the prompter said, "Both of whom
are hinting at good numbers,"

17:54.490 --> 17:56.908
and you said, "Both of which
are hinting at good numbers."

17:56.993 --> 17:58.076
Was that an accident?

17:58.161 --> 17:59.578
No. I didn't write that copy.

17:59.662 --> 18:02.122
I changed it to "which"
because "whom" is for people.

18:02.206 --> 18:04.166
- Is someone in trouble?
- No.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.084
Do you mind coming into my office
for a second?

18:06.169 --> 18:07.210
Sure.

18:07.295 --> 18:09.296
What's the difference
between a corporation and a person?

18:10.173 --> 18:11.757
Have you ever held a door open for someone?

18:11.841 --> 18:13.300
- Yes.
- Did you ask them for money first?

18:13.384 --> 18:15.093
- No.
- That's the difference.

18:15.178 --> 18:16.261
That's the right answer.

18:16.345 --> 18:18.597
- Am I taking a test?
- I've asked around and people say

18:18.681 --> 18:20.265
you don't belong here,
that you could be making

18:20.349 --> 18:22.434
a lot more money as an analyst at Goldman.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.853
Couldn't you be making a lot more money
producing reality television?

18:25.229 --> 18:27.564
I do produce reality television.

18:28.566 --> 18:30.901
I don't know what to tell you. I like my job.

18:31.027 --> 18:32.694
Do you feel like working longer hours?

18:34.030 --> 18:35.280
They talked to me
about doing a morning show

18:35.364 --> 18:36.656
a couple of times, but I can't do that.

18:36.908 --> 18:39.075
I'm not interested in cooking.
I make sandwiches.

18:39.702 --> 18:42.162
I get that I don't necessarily look like it,
but I'm an economist.

18:42.413 --> 18:44.581
- Thanks, though.
- Yeah, I meant in prime time.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.501
I want to give you five minutes every night

18:47.585 --> 18:50.212
to talk about where we are
and how we got here.

18:51.297 --> 18:52.422
Are you serious?

18:53.257 --> 18:54.758
There are people more qualified than I am.

18:54.926 --> 18:57.469
I can put you in touch with some
of the professors that I studied under...

18:57.553 --> 19:00.013
Yeah, the thing is they're
not going to have your legs.

19:01.766 --> 19:05.352
I'm sorry, but if I'm going to get people
to listen to an economics lesson,

19:05.436 --> 19:08.396
I've got to find someone
who doesn't look like George Bernard Shaw.

19:08.481 --> 19:11.525
I would not ask you
if I didn't think you were qualified.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.612
You want me to do pole dancing
while explaining subprime mortgages?

19:15.696 --> 19:16.822
If you're up to it, sure.

19:18.449 --> 19:19.658
All right, I get it.

19:19.742 --> 19:21.576
We'll start a conversation
with Will about our goals

19:21.661 --> 19:23.119
- and how we're going to get there.
- Great.

19:23.204 --> 19:24.788
I think you and I are going to be good friends.

19:24.872 --> 19:25.956
- I'd like that.
- Me, too.

19:26.040 --> 19:28.041
- Okay.
- I mean it. I don't have any friends.

19:28.751 --> 19:29.751
Oh.

19:30.044 --> 19:32.003
You know, you're new in town, so...

19:32.088 --> 19:33.797
Yeah, yeah.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.342
You know, you and I
have something in common.

19:37.426 --> 19:38.468
What's that?

19:38.928 --> 19:40.303
I had a boyfriend who cheated on me, too.

19:40.638 --> 19:41.888
- Ah.
- The week of our wedding.

19:41.973 --> 19:43.890
Oh. Oh.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.018
I don't understand.

19:47.311 --> 19:48.353
I know about Will.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.605
Yeah, yeah.

19:52.275 --> 19:53.525
I still don't understand.

19:55.319 --> 19:57.362
Wait, Will didn't cheat on me.

19:58.114 --> 20:00.740
- I used to deny it, too.
- Will didn't cheat on me.

20:00.825 --> 20:02.534
- Oh, okay, sorry.
- I can't talk about what happened,

20:02.618 --> 20:04.119
but I can tell you that Will didn't cheat on me.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.371
- I shouldn't have mentioned anything.
- Sloan, listen to me.

20:06.497 --> 20:07.622
Will didn't cheat on me.

20:07.790 --> 20:09.916
Yes, we were together
for two years and we broke up.

20:10.001 --> 20:12.711
I can't tell you any more than that,
but he never, ever, never cheated on me.

20:12.795 --> 20:14.504
- Who told you that?
- Everybody.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.381
That's what people... No, no, no.

20:16.465 --> 20:17.716
That's not what happened.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.302
- You don't have to tell me what happened.
- I can't tell you what happened.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.429
He doesn't want anyone in the office to know.
He made me promise.

20:23.139 --> 20:24.472
No, not because...

20:25.141 --> 20:26.641
I can't talk. Ugh!

20:26.809 --> 20:28.768
Even though in this situation,
I think he'd prefer...

20:28.853 --> 20:31.479
No, he really doesn't want
the office to know anything.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.940
- He didn't cheat on me.
- I should get back to work.

20:34.025 --> 20:35.901
You need to tell people that.

20:36.986 --> 20:38.069
You're enabling an ass.

20:38.154 --> 20:39.738
He's... Whoa.

20:40.156 --> 20:41.907
He's not an ass.

20:43.492 --> 20:44.659
Come here.

20:45.411 --> 20:47.662
Will's not an ass. He's the opposite of an ass.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.748
Even if he did cheat on me,
which he absolutely didn't,

20:49.832 --> 20:51.124
he's definitely not an ass.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.959
- Do people think that?
- You had to have known that.

20:53.044 --> 20:55.045
I thought they thought he was gruff,
but lovable.

20:55.129 --> 20:56.588
No, they think he's an ass
who cheated on you.

20:56.672 --> 20:57.923
That has to be corrected.

20:58.007 --> 21:00.008
- I have to start the 4:00.
- Okay, okay, okay.

21:00.509 --> 21:01.718
You need to do this.

21:02.011 --> 21:03.637
You need to go from person to person

21:03.721 --> 21:06.348
and tell them that Will is an extraordinary man

21:06.432 --> 21:08.141
with a heart the size of a Range Rover,

21:08.225 --> 21:11.519
that there's a long story that has to do...

21:11.604 --> 21:13.229
A lot to do with me, but also other things.

21:13.314 --> 21:16.441
I can't tell you the story of his life,
but he's the good guy.

21:17.568 --> 21:19.277
- Will you tell people that?
- Every chance I get.

21:19.362 --> 21:21.029
- You're not going to, right?
- No, I'm not.

21:21.155 --> 21:22.364
Okay.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.991
We spiked up 9% overall.

21:25.076 --> 21:27.243
On top of the 7%
that came after Northwestern.

21:27.328 --> 21:28.536
You played high school football.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.205
What do you do when you have
a lead late in the game?

21:30.289 --> 21:31.748
My high school never had to worry about that.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.291
- You protect the lead.
- Will McAvoy!

21:33.459 --> 21:35.961
How do you get used to eating lunch
at 4:00 in the afternoon?

21:36.045 --> 21:38.505
I work from 11:00 to 9:00.
It's across all demos, too.

21:38.589 --> 21:41.466
Will McAvoy's the place to be
for all things BP.

21:41.550 --> 21:44.552
Hey, I need you to tell me right now
you're not using that as a promo slug.

21:44.637 --> 21:47.389
We're not, but Brad ground-researched
the hell out of this since Northwestern,

21:47.473 --> 21:50.308
and the feedback we keep getting,
especially from 18 to 49s,

21:50.393 --> 21:51.643
is just studded with green flags.

21:51.727 --> 21:53.103
And this isn't Brad selective-coding, man.

21:53.187 --> 21:56.147
We're talking about an actual, bona fide,
audience-driven response to Northwestern

21:56.232 --> 21:57.565
and the way you handled the breaking news.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.442
I don't see them
capping the well anytime soon.

21:59.527 --> 22:01.319
- But you're not leading with it.
- Not tonight.

22:01.404 --> 22:02.862
It'll be down in the D block.

22:02.947 --> 22:04.030
It sunk this morning.

22:04.115 --> 22:08.118
We got film of a massive offshore drilling rig
sinking into the Gulf of Mexico.

22:08.244 --> 22:09.244
We knew that was gonna happen.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.496
People knew the Titanic was gonna sink
when they went to the movie,

22:11.580 --> 22:14.374
but it was cool to watch,
which is why they went to the movie.

22:14.750 --> 22:17.168
Partner, something's going on here
and you gotta tell me what it is.

22:17.253 --> 22:19.546
Look, we're trying to format a new broadcast

22:19.630 --> 22:21.506
that puts a priority
on information voters need,

22:21.590 --> 22:23.967
puts the information in context,
and then tries to present

22:24.051 --> 22:26.052
the best possible versions
of competing arguments.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.430
Here's what I just heard, "We got a hit show
that just got bigger,

22:28.514 --> 22:30.015
"so now we're trying to fix it."

22:31.142 --> 22:32.517
Listen, there's no one here but me and you.

22:32.601 --> 22:34.519
Is this something you want
or something you got talked into?

22:34.603 --> 22:36.187
It's... No, it's something I want badly.

22:36.272 --> 22:38.982
- I've wanted this since the dawn of time.
- More than numbers?

22:39.066 --> 22:41.609
Weren't you the one that told me
that your audience are your only friends?

22:41.694 --> 22:43.987
I said that after a couple of shots
of some kind of varnish remover

22:44.071 --> 22:45.530
at a particularly low point in my life.

22:45.614 --> 22:47.032
- That was two weeks ago.
- It was a very low point.

22:47.116 --> 22:48.575
- I think it was lower than three weeks ago.
- Will.

22:48.659 --> 22:51.453
MacKenzie thinks I don't have
to sacrifice one for the other.

22:51.537 --> 22:53.705
Well, MacKenzie is the expert
on predicting audience trends.

22:53.789 --> 22:54.956
No, wait. She's not, Brad is.

22:55.082 --> 22:56.833
- We're not setting out to lose viewers.
- No one ever does.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.585
Just better news for the ones we've got.

22:58.669 --> 22:59.878
All right, I'll stop.

23:00.504 --> 23:02.464
Listen, I still want your advice every day.

23:02.548 --> 23:04.758
My advice today,
go to the conservative websites.

23:04.842 --> 23:06.009
- I do.
- You'll see that they like you.

23:06.093 --> 23:07.093
They think you're a RINO, but they like

23:07.178 --> 23:08.887
that you don't take cheap shots
at Sarah Palin.

23:08.971 --> 23:10.722
- Look at the comments section.
- Yeah, I know.

23:10.806 --> 23:13.349
Palin made a statement
about the spill last night.

23:13.434 --> 23:14.642
- It was ridiculous.
- Yes, it was.

23:14.727 --> 23:16.061
It'll be a joke on every late-night show.

23:16.145 --> 23:17.562
She basically wrote Letterman's monologue.

23:17.646 --> 23:18.813
- So you want my advice?
- Yes.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.523
Be the guy that doesn't
take a shot at her tonight.

23:20.608 --> 23:22.025
Well, I won't be taking a shot at her,

23:22.109 --> 23:23.401
but that's because I won't be using her.

23:23.486 --> 23:25.070
I'm saying you should use her,
but not to take a shot...

23:25.154 --> 23:26.404
No, she's a private citizen.

23:26.489 --> 23:28.323
She doesn't have
any qualifications in this area,

23:28.407 --> 23:30.033
so it's hard with the new format to justify...

23:30.117 --> 23:31.868
Let me tell you what it looks like
when the audience leaves.

23:31.952 --> 23:33.078
I can't jam in a Palin SOT

23:33.162 --> 23:35.747
just to give myself the opportunity
to not take a shot at her.

23:35.831 --> 23:37.791
If I cross that line, I'm just saying,
"Fuck the whole thing."

23:37.875 --> 23:39.918
It looks like this, first you lose the people
who just got here.

23:40.002 --> 23:42.128
Then everyone writes that you lost the people
that just got here.

23:42.213 --> 23:44.089
That makes people think
they're not at the cool party anymore.

23:44.173 --> 23:46.174
You ever been at Sardi's on opening night
of a Broadway show

23:46.258 --> 23:48.593
five minutes after word gets out
the Times panned it?

23:48.677 --> 23:49.803
They leave.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.972
And they never come back, ever.

23:53.057 --> 23:55.850
And it happens in not much more time
than it just took me to describe it.

23:57.228 --> 23:59.479
It's conservatives who watch the news on TV.

23:59.563 --> 24:02.107
Don't pass up an opportunity
to remind them why they don't hate you.

24:02.191 --> 24:03.775
I really want to give the new format a...

24:03.859 --> 24:05.360
Also, would you do me a favor
and tell Charlie Skinner

24:05.444 --> 24:06.694
that you're the one
who asked for these meetings?

24:06.779 --> 24:08.113
And do you want me
to fix you up with someone

24:08.197 --> 24:10.198
who'll take your mind off
a girl from three years ago?

24:10.282 --> 24:11.783
- No, thank you.
- Palin.

24:11.867 --> 24:12.909
- She's married.
- Not to fix you up with.

24:12.993 --> 24:15.370
- I'm saying use the Palin SOT.
- I know. It's not gonna happen.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.622
- MacKenzie would cook me and eat me.
- You're the boss.

24:19.583 --> 24:22.877
I'll keep reminding you of that
because I'm not wild about your ex.

24:23.045 --> 24:25.922
Hey, look, her name is MacKenzie
or Ms. McHale,

24:26.006 --> 24:29.676
and she's reported more real news in one day
than I have in my career.

24:31.720 --> 24:32.887
Fuck.

24:49.071 --> 24:51.072
- Hi.
- Hello.

24:51.198 --> 24:52.782
Jan Brewerjust bailed on us for tonight.

24:52.992 --> 24:55.076
- What are you talking about?
- They canceled.

24:55.161 --> 24:58.079
- She's going on CNN.
-  Who's she sending instead?

24:58.164 --> 25:00.832
Maggie, no one from the governor's office
is coming on the show.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.167
What happened with the call?

25:02.251 --> 25:03.293
- Oh, God.
- What happened?

25:03.377 --> 25:05.503
- This can't be because of the call.
- It happened on the call.

25:05.588 --> 25:07.630
I swear, I kept my personal feelings to myself.

25:07.715 --> 25:10.508
I was on the phone with Glenn Fisher,

25:11.051 --> 25:12.260
and it was really just by the book.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.012
Okay, so the pre-interview was going fine.

25:14.096 --> 25:15.346
- Yeah.
- When all of a sudden...

25:15.431 --> 25:17.223
Things happen, Jim, okay,

25:17.308 --> 25:19.475
that are beyond your
super-newsman powers of understanding.

25:19.560 --> 25:22.520
I wish you had told me
that you dated Glenn Fisher in college.

25:22.605 --> 25:23.980
How could you possibly know that?

25:24.064 --> 25:25.565
He told me,
which is what you should have done.

25:25.649 --> 25:27.108
I know,
but I thought you'd take it away from me.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.610
- I would have.
- And that's why I didn't tell you.

25:28.694 --> 25:30.320
You have to tell me.
If you've had a relationship...

25:30.404 --> 25:31.446
It wasn't a relationship.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.697
- We went out four times.
- Maggie.

25:32.781 --> 25:34.741
And now he's the press aide
to the governor of a state

25:34.825 --> 25:36.701
that gave us Barry Goldwater
and a football team

25:36.785 --> 25:38.328
that couldn't find the end zone
with an OnStar system.

25:38.412 --> 25:40.079
- You're a football fan?
- No, I looked it up.

25:40.164 --> 25:41.372
Also, the fourth date didn't count.

25:41.457 --> 25:43.541
Is the fourth date relevant
to the pre-interview?

25:43.626 --> 25:45.501
- It might be.
- What happened on the fourth date?

25:46.587 --> 25:48.213
We went back to his dorm room,

25:48.297 --> 25:50.131
- we started making out a little.
- Uh-huh.

25:50.216 --> 25:51.883
And then there was
a crazy banging on the door.

25:51.967 --> 25:53.927
It was his ex-girlfriend and she was shouting,

25:54.011 --> 25:55.720
"I know you've got some slut in there!"

25:55.804 --> 25:56.971
- I think she meant me.
- Yeah.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.890
And Glenn said, "Get under the bed."

25:58.974 --> 26:00.808
- Not the closet?
- No room in the closet. It's a dorm.

26:01.143 --> 26:03.561
So I got under the bed
and he let his ex-girlfriend in,

26:03.646 --> 26:05.521
and the two of them patched things up.

26:05.606 --> 26:06.898
- With you under the bed.
- Yeah.

26:06.982 --> 26:08.149
When you say they patched things up...

26:08.234 --> 26:10.068
- Yeah.
- You're saying...

26:10.152 --> 26:11.903
Oh, my God. They did it, Jim! Okay?

26:12.655 --> 26:14.113
They settled their differences.

26:14.657 --> 26:16.407
And it didn't take very long,
because as it turns out,

26:16.492 --> 26:17.867
- Glenn doesn't take very long.
- Compared to who?

26:17.952 --> 26:20.662
Compared to  other people

26:20.829 --> 26:22.747
and what I've read about in the movies.

26:22.831 --> 26:23.831
- It doesn't matter.
- Five minutes?

26:23.916 --> 26:25.124
I didn't have a stopwatch on him,

26:25.209 --> 26:27.919
but I know it was under two minutes
because I was holding my breath.

26:28.003 --> 26:30.171
- Is this important?
- I don't know what's important yet.

26:30.256 --> 26:31.965
That's why I'm listening to this story.

26:34.760 --> 26:35.927
They finished, they left.

26:36.011 --> 26:37.428
I waited a minute, and then I left.

26:37.513 --> 26:38.596
Fast forward to the call.

26:38.681 --> 26:40.265
He says, "The governor would also like to talk

26:40.349 --> 26:42.976
"about Arizona doing well
on Obama's Race to the Finish initiative."

26:43.102 --> 26:44.269
And you say to Glenn...

26:44.353 --> 26:45.353
"How appropriate for you."

26:46.063 --> 26:47.105
- Good one.
- Thank you.

26:47.189 --> 26:48.940
You said you didn't inject
any of your personal opinions...

26:49.024 --> 26:51.276
About the bill. I didn't inject
any personal opinions about the bill.

26:51.360 --> 26:54.737
Okay, first of all, the initiative is called
Race to the Top, not Race to the Finish.

26:54.822 --> 26:57.740
I know. That's why I was so sure
God was on my side,

26:57.825 --> 26:59.158
because he teed me up so perfectly.

26:59.243 --> 27:01.619
- And second, why didn't he...
- Why didn't he get her out of the room?

27:02.246 --> 27:04.455
It was 2:00 in the morning.
What was he gonna say?

27:04.540 --> 27:06.374
"Why don't we go
somewhere private and talk?"

27:06.458 --> 27:07.959
They were in his dorm room. He was stuck.

27:08.043 --> 27:09.836
- There were no options.
- You had an option.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.504
You could have not hidden under the bed.

27:11.588 --> 27:14.173
I made a quick decision.
It may have been the wrong one...

27:14.258 --> 27:17.302
- "It may have been..."
- But once I made it, I had to commit to it.

27:17.386 --> 27:18.970
And I will tell you something else.

27:19.054 --> 27:21.806
He waited this long
to tell us he was bailing on purpose

27:21.890 --> 27:23.683
so we'd get slammed
on getting a replacement.

27:23.767 --> 27:25.852
- Do you think?
- Are you being sarcastic?

27:25.936 --> 27:28.229
Because, yes,
I'm pretty sure he did this on purpose.

27:29.732 --> 27:33.318
We've got less than 90 minutes
to find someone to defend SB 1070

27:33.402 --> 27:34.986
and get them to a studio.

27:35.070 --> 27:37.572
But after the show, a bunch of us
are going over to the Emerald City

27:37.656 --> 27:38.948
to see the Wizard
and maybe he can give you some...

27:39.033 --> 27:40.033
My brain is fine.

27:40.117 --> 27:41.617
You give me the SATs right now
and I'll take them.

27:41.702 --> 27:43.578
Maybe he'll give you some courage
is what I was going to say.

27:45.914 --> 27:47.123
Please!

27:48.584 --> 27:49.959
Tell me what to do.

27:51.378 --> 27:53.629
Grab some bookers, whoever's free,
and come into the conference room.

27:53.714 --> 27:55.465
- This is an emergency now.
- We'll be right there.

27:55.549 --> 27:56.591
- Maggie.
- Yeah.

27:57.426 --> 28:00.762
I don't know anyone in the world

28:00.846 --> 28:02.680
who would have hidden under the bed.

28:06.268 --> 28:08.686
Martin, Tamara, Kendra, I need some help.

28:08.771 --> 28:11.981
- What do you need?
- No, I can... It's no big deal.

28:12.066 --> 28:13.816
I just need...

28:13.901 --> 28:15.568
Kendra, Tamara, Martin!

28:16.111 --> 28:17.987
- Everything all right?
- I can fix it.

28:20.949 --> 28:22.200
Okay.

28:23.369 --> 28:25.161
What?

28:30.167 --> 28:32.502
- What the hell is going on?
- We lost Jan Brewer.

28:32.586 --> 28:34.170
What? God!

28:34.797 --> 28:35.797
Get someone else from Brewer's office.

28:35.881 --> 28:37.924
- No, we've lost the whole office.
- What?

28:38.133 --> 28:39.384
No one from Brewer's office
is gonna be coming.

28:39.468 --> 28:40.510
What the hell happened?

28:40.594 --> 28:42.970
- This is my fault.
- Look, I got into a stupid argument

28:43.055 --> 28:44.263
with a press aide on the phone,

28:44.515 --> 28:46.557
and now he's giving the governor's office
to everybody but us

28:46.642 --> 28:49.143
- so he can stick it to me.
- Are you freaking kidding me?

28:49.228 --> 28:51.896
- No, wait. Mac...
- No. That is what happened.

28:51.980 --> 28:54.899
Day side's been running Jan Brewer promos
for the last six hours.

28:54.983 --> 28:56.567
Who's replacing her?

28:56.652 --> 28:58.361
Well, we're obviously late to the buffet,

28:58.445 --> 29:01.280
so we basically had to book people
who were close to a satellite dish.

29:01.365 --> 29:02.990
- Oh, boy.
- Dr. Dwayne Sotter.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.201
He's an adjunct professor
at the University of Phoenix.

29:05.285 --> 29:08.704
The University of Phoenix
is an online university. It's not in Arizona.

29:08.831 --> 29:10.706
- But you can understand our mistake, right?
- No.

29:10.791 --> 29:12.417
He's written several books
on immigration policy.

29:12.543 --> 29:14.794
- Have I heard of any of them?
- They were self-published.

29:15.421 --> 29:17.463
This Land is My Land, Ambushed

29:17.548 --> 29:21.092
and Don't Make Me Press One
for English in My Own Country.

29:21.176 --> 29:22.802
- That is quite a sacrifice.
- Tamara.

29:22.886 --> 29:24.220
We've got a former Miss Oklahoma

29:24.304 --> 29:26.597
who was second runner-up
in the Miss USA pageant this year.

29:26.682 --> 29:28.015
She claims she was denied first runner-up

29:28.142 --> 29:30.101
because of an answer she gave
regarding illegal immigration.

29:30.185 --> 29:31.769
- Ah, the real victim.
- Martin.

29:31.854 --> 29:33.229
Right, the third is Ross Fernholm,

29:33.313 --> 29:35.106
- a former state patrolman who was part...
- Don't say it.

29:35.190 --> 29:36.899
...of a border control group
called the "Citizens Militia."

29:36.984 --> 29:40.695
Is this or isn't this the exact opposite
of who I asked you to book?

29:40.779 --> 29:42.363
God damn it, Jim! What the hell were you...

29:42.448 --> 29:43.698
- This is all...
- All gonna be fine.

29:43.824 --> 29:44.907
Jim is taking the fall...

29:44.992 --> 29:47.535
For exactly what I'm supposed
to take the fall for.

29:47.619 --> 29:48.911
I don't know what the hell dance
you two are doing.

29:49.204 --> 29:51.080
Don't book these guys. Scrap the segment.

29:51.165 --> 29:53.207
They'll say we didn't have
anyone defending it.

29:57.546 --> 30:00.298
Let's prep them the best we can
and have Will carry them, okay?

30:01.258 --> 30:02.675
He'll just carry them.

30:03.969 --> 30:05.720
- I'll go and tell him.
- I should be the one to tell him.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.096
- Maggie...
- He's gonna fire somebody.

30:07.181 --> 30:08.514
- God knows he should.
- He will.

30:08.599 --> 30:12.393
He won't.

30:15.063 --> 30:16.564
Guys, he won't.

30:18.066 --> 30:19.442
Hang on.

30:19.776 --> 30:21.235
Dome of silence. I have to...

30:23.572 --> 30:26.365
Are people here under the impression
that Will is an ass?

30:32.372 --> 30:34.248
Okay, you're wrong.

30:34.458 --> 30:37.335
You know, you're just wrong
and it's an injustice.

30:37.419 --> 30:41.631
He's... He'd throw himself in front of a train
for anyone in this...

30:42.424 --> 30:44.467
- Is Will in his office?
- He's at that thing uptown.

30:44.551 --> 30:46.636
I'm sending him an e-mail because I...

30:46.720 --> 30:52.016
I can't live with this stupid promise I made.

30:52.100 --> 30:56.646
And, you know,
completely wrong information.

30:56.730 --> 30:59.440
I'm nipping this thing in the bud right now.

30:59.525 --> 31:01.692
And send.

31:01.777 --> 31:05.696
Will is the best man I've ever...

31:14.331 --> 31:15.957
- What just happened?
- I got a staff e-mail from you.

31:16.041 --> 31:18.459
- Me, too.
- I sent the e-mail to Sloan, I mean Will.

31:18.585 --> 31:20.545
Ah. Oh, my God, I sent it to Sloan.

31:20.629 --> 31:22.380
I think the "S" in "Sloan" became "staff."

31:22.464 --> 31:23.756
You used the asterisk.

31:28.011 --> 31:29.637
No.

31:29.721 --> 31:34.141
No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

31:34.226 --> 31:36.727
Everybody listen! Listen to me right now.

31:40.691 --> 31:41.732
- Oh, man.
- Oh!

31:47.364 --> 31:48.406
That was unusual.

31:48.490 --> 31:50.366
I want everyone to delete
the e-mail you just received.

31:50.450 --> 31:52.910
Delete it right now without reading it.
Honor system.

31:52.995 --> 31:56.414
And then I need someone
to sneak into Will's office

31:56.498 --> 31:58.708
and delete the e-mail from his inbox.

31:58.792 --> 32:00.626
If it's password-protected,

32:00.711 --> 32:04.422
I need you to take a baseball bat and smash...

32:11.013 --> 32:13.014
- You told me he was uptown.
- I guess he came back.

32:15.475 --> 32:18.060
- We stood in my office...
- Will.

32:18.312 --> 32:21.522
...this morning, and I said
under no circumstances

32:21.607 --> 32:24.609
do I want anyone here
to know what happened.

32:24.693 --> 32:27.862
And you said, "Yes," and, "Yes," again.

32:28.030 --> 32:30.448
And it really...

32:30.532 --> 32:33.534
It really seemed like you understood.

32:34.369 --> 32:36.621
- And then you sent an e-mail...
- It was a complete...

32:36.705 --> 32:40.875
- Explaining in some detail what happened.
- Please, please let me...

32:41.209 --> 32:43.961
And then you copied 47 reporters on it.

32:44.046 --> 32:45.171
Can we go into your office?

32:45.255 --> 32:47.548
You know how sometimes
something happens in an instant

32:47.633 --> 32:50.676
that's so astonishing you just shut down?

32:50.761 --> 32:55.222
- Of course, that's...
- That doesn't fucking happen to me!

32:57.059 --> 32:59.226
- We need some privacy.
- Really?

32:59.394 --> 33:00.895
We're going to go into Will's office,

33:01.480 --> 33:03.814
but I want everyone to delete the e-mail.

33:03.899 --> 33:05.983
Mac, I think I just accidentally
forwarded it to corporate.

33:07.194 --> 33:08.235
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.488
- Why is this happening?
- I was sending an e-mail to you,

33:10.572 --> 33:11.906
but accidentally sent it to Sloan Sabbith,

33:12.032 --> 33:15.034
but I either did or didn't type the asterisk
and it went to staff instead of Sloan.

33:15.118 --> 33:16.243
Why were you sending it at all?

33:16.370 --> 33:19.080
Because, and here's where I think
I'm on firmer ground,

33:19.915 --> 33:22.124
she thought that you cheated on me

33:22.209 --> 33:23.584
and that you were an ass,

33:23.835 --> 33:26.087
which is not true. I'm changing minds, Will.

33:26.171 --> 33:27.672
I'm changing minds all over the place.

33:27.756 --> 33:29.256
- Get in there!
- Sure.

33:33.178 --> 33:35.763
She thought you cheated on me
and she told me other people thought so, too.

33:35.889 --> 33:39.600
I couldn't take that, but I do take 100%
of the responsibility for what just happened.

33:39.768 --> 33:41.560
Who else would be responsible?

33:41.645 --> 33:43.020
Arizona prison stats.

33:43.105 --> 33:44.897
- Thank you.
- No one. I'm sorry.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.607
- Don't mention it.
- That's...

33:47.109 --> 33:50.194
I'm really impressed that
you're forgiving me so fast.

33:50.278 --> 33:52.363
- I would have...
- No, what you heard was, "Don't mention it.

33:52.447 --> 33:53.781
"It's no problem. Don't worry about it."

33:53.865 --> 33:55.783
What I said was, "Don't mention it ever."

33:55.867 --> 33:57.368
- Will...
- Ever, Mac!

33:57.452 --> 33:59.203
- Hospital costs and health care.
- How current?

33:59.287 --> 34:00.871
- Fiscal 2009.
- Thank you.

34:00.956 --> 34:02.289
I understand.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.583
One more thing.

34:05.127 --> 34:07.002
We lost Jan Brewer and had to replace her

34:07.087 --> 34:10.005
with a crazy professor at a website,
a member of the Citizens Militia,

34:10.090 --> 34:12.466
and a former second runner-up
in the Miss USA pageant.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.927
It's going to be fine. You'll carry them.
They'll barely have to speak.

34:18.557 --> 34:19.765
Now you've shut down, right?

34:22.978 --> 34:25.062
- Who fucked up?
- Now, you know I'm not going to tell you that.

34:25.147 --> 34:26.397
Okay.

34:29.484 --> 34:30.943
- 98%.
- What?

34:31.027 --> 34:34.238
I take 98% of the responsibility, not 100%.

34:34.322 --> 34:35.364
Is that right?

34:36.324 --> 34:37.658
Listen.

34:39.870 --> 34:41.454
You were in love from the day you met me,

34:41.538 --> 34:44.373
and for two years, you were the man
of any woman's dreams, you know?

34:44.499 --> 34:48.836
You'd have these ways of doing things.

34:51.298 --> 34:52.631
It doesn't matter.

34:53.425 --> 34:56.635
I didn't know that I was in love
with you too, until...

34:56.720 --> 34:58.095
You cheated on me with your ex-boyfriend.

34:58.180 --> 35:00.264
That's right! That's what happened.

35:00.348 --> 35:03.142
I didn't know how I felt about you
until I was with him again.

35:03.226 --> 35:05.853
So technically, I wasn't cheating
on the man I loved,

35:05.937 --> 35:08.481
I was falling in love with the man I loved.

35:08.565 --> 35:09.857
While cheating on him with your ex-boyfriend.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.358
Yes!

35:11.651 --> 35:13.569
But you're missing that technically
it wasn't cheating, though.

35:13.653 --> 35:15.738
The more important thing is
that I fell in love with you.

35:15.822 --> 35:18.699
At the end of a romantic comedy,
that would make everything okay!

35:18.784 --> 35:21.118
There's something I've always
been dying to ask you.

35:21.203 --> 35:22.495
Ask anything.

35:22.662 --> 35:24.497
Why did you tell me?

35:25.332 --> 35:26.957
Because I wouldn't have been able
to live with it.

35:27.042 --> 35:28.375
Now I have to live with it.

35:28.919 --> 35:31.337
- Would you rather I'd have been dishonest?
- Yes.

35:35.091 --> 35:38.302
Yes, I'd very much rather

35:38.512 --> 35:40.346
you hadn't told me.

35:45.227 --> 35:46.852
Still, 98%.

35:48.897 --> 35:50.648
I'm sorry, we have to do the final rundown.

35:50.732 --> 35:52.066
We're coming.

35:53.485 --> 35:55.486
The first runner-up wasn't available?

36:00.951 --> 36:02.493
Sixty seconds to V. T.R.

36:02.869 --> 36:04.495
Are we getting the opening in HD or SD?

36:04.663 --> 36:06.413
Where's it coming to me?
Which router?

36:06.665 --> 36:08.123
Roll it in from the room.

36:08.291 --> 36:09.583
Tess.

36:10.252 --> 36:12.044
There's an SOT I want in the D block.

36:12.128 --> 36:15.047
Sarah Palin's comment on the White House
not returning calls from the Dutch,

36:15.131 --> 36:16.841
except she calls Holland Norway.

36:16.925 --> 36:18.509
Find it, give it to Jake.

36:18.593 --> 36:20.386
- Don't run it past Mac.
- Yes, sir.

36:22.389 --> 36:24.056
Did we go to Afghanistan
because you cheated on Will?

36:24.140 --> 36:26.684
- Can I get a little privacy?
- Not until you learn how to send an e-mail.

36:26.768 --> 36:29.186
- You got invaluable experience.
- I got shot in the ass.

36:29.271 --> 36:31.272
Well, be grateful
you weren't facing the other direction.

36:31.481 --> 36:33.107
Thirty seconds out.

36:35.735 --> 36:37.111
I've been cheated on.

36:38.780 --> 36:40.781
One time literally right on top of me.

36:41.783 --> 36:44.535
This happened because of me.
No one should get fired.

36:44.619 --> 36:47.955
I can resign, and it's fine
because Don wants me at 10:00.

36:49.165 --> 36:50.791
I hope you don't do that.

36:51.251 --> 36:53.002
I hope you stay here.

36:54.754 --> 36:56.130
Good show.

36:56.756 --> 36:58.632
Can you move
his BlackBerry off the desk?

36:58.717 --> 37:00.634
- I can see it in the shot.
- Will.

37:01.261 --> 37:03.429
Can you move your BlackBerry off the desk?

37:03.972 --> 37:05.139
Oh!

37:05.724 --> 37:08.392
That wouldn't have happened
if he'd had one of those rubber protectors.

37:08.476 --> 37:10.269
- Does 3 have to change lenses?
- No, we're good.

37:10.353 --> 37:13.606
In four, three, two. Roll V. T.R.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.869
Good evening. I'm Will McAvoy.

37:26.953 --> 37:30.497
Deepwater Horizon continues to spill oil
even as it sinks into the Gulf,

37:30.582 --> 37:32.499
a Republican candidate for senate in Nevada

37:32.584 --> 37:34.960
advocates poor people paying
doctors with chickens,

37:35.045 --> 37:38.088
and Greece activates
a $45 billion aid package.

37:38.423 --> 37:40.049
But we begin tonight in Arizona,

37:40.133 --> 37:43.886
where Governor Jan Brewer today
signed into law SB 1070,

37:44.179 --> 37:45.971
which allows police to ask for documentation

37:46.056 --> 37:48.766
from anyone suspected of being
in the country illegally.

37:48.850 --> 37:50.684
Our coverage begins with Rachel Sachs

37:50.769 --> 37:52.561
at the statehouse in Phoenix. Rachel?

37:53.647 --> 37:55.147
I have no idea if the president even knows

37:55.231 --> 37:58.317
that an entire Exxon Valdez
is spilling into the Gulf every four days.

37:58.401 --> 37:59.526
Are you really not sure?

37:59.611 --> 38:01.362
Because that would make you dumber
than previous estimates.

38:01.446 --> 38:02.655
- Would the two of you shut up?
- Sorry.

38:02.739 --> 38:03.781
I miss my BlackBerry.

38:03.949 --> 38:06.575
Joining us tonight from Washington
is Daniel Mendoza,

38:06.660 --> 38:08.869
Deputy Director
of the National Council of La Raza,

38:08.954 --> 38:12.206
the largest Hispanic civil rights organization
in the US.

38:12.332 --> 38:13.707
Good evening, Mr. Mendoza.

38:13.792 --> 38:15.417
Thanks for inviting me here
to speak to you, Will.

38:15.710 --> 38:16.752
Let's jump right in.

38:16.836 --> 38:21.715
Estimates are that illegal immigrants
cost Arizonans $2.7 billion a year.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.801
- Is that a problem worth fixing?
- Of course it is.

38:23.885 --> 38:25.928
But if it's an economic issue,
you need to consider

38:26.054 --> 38:28.639
that deporting
12 million undocumented workers

38:28.723 --> 38:32.601
will drain 2.5 trillion over the next 10 years
from our GDP.

38:32.936 --> 38:35.938
Arizona residents overwhelmingly
favor spending that money.

38:36.064 --> 38:37.398
Back in two minutes.

38:37.524 --> 38:39.233
- We don't have 1705.
- Joey.

38:47.659 --> 38:48.742
- Thirty seconds out.
- All right,

38:48.827 --> 38:50.995
we know this next segment's
going to be a problem.

38:51.079 --> 38:52.162
Really?

38:52.247 --> 38:54.957
Why do you automatically assume
that a hospitality management major

38:55.041 --> 38:58.794
won't be able to speak with sophistication
about constitutional law?

38:59.504 --> 39:01.922
Make sure everybody knows
this is what blowing it looks like.

39:02.173 --> 39:03.257
They know.

39:06.886 --> 39:08.053
Twenty out.

39:09.139 --> 39:10.472
It's gonna be fine.

39:10.557 --> 39:12.850
The PhD is cool with illegal immigrants

39:12.934 --> 39:16.270
as long as they're checked for diseases
like smallpox and gayness.

39:16.604 --> 39:18.605
I'm not sure I gave Will
the best form of the argument.

39:20.191 --> 39:21.442
- Didn't we cure small...
- Yes.

39:21.901 --> 39:22.943
Fifteen back.

39:23.069 --> 39:24.862
Does the militia guy
really want his gun in the shot?

39:24.946 --> 39:27.364
I asked him that and he said,
"This isn't a gun, it's a rifle.

39:27.449 --> 39:30.325
"And this rifle has a name,
and her name is Jenny."

39:30.410 --> 39:32.536
If you keep covering for people,
I don't know who can do what.

39:32.620 --> 39:34.121
- I wasn't covering.
- You've got a crush on this girl.

39:34.247 --> 39:36.081
You told me to. And, no, I don't.

39:36.166 --> 39:38.333
In three, two. Cue Will.

39:38.418 --> 39:42.379
Welcome back. We're discussing
Arizona's immigration bill SB 1070,

39:42.464 --> 39:44.715
the Support Our Law Enforcement
and Safe Neighborhoods Act,

39:44.799 --> 39:47.551
which was signed into law today
by Governor Jan Brewer.

39:47.635 --> 39:48.969
Joining me now by satellite

39:49.095 --> 39:51.138
are three strong supporters of the new law,

39:51.264 --> 39:53.057
Dr. Dwayne Sotter, an academic

39:53.141 --> 39:55.267
who's written extensively
about immigration policy,

39:55.351 --> 39:57.644
Ross Fernholm,
a former Arizona State Patrolman,

39:57.729 --> 40:00.522
who now runs the all-volunteer
Independence Border Guards in Yuma,

40:00.690 --> 40:03.275
and Gwen Lalley,
a junior at the University of New Mexico

40:03.401 --> 40:05.986
and the second runner-up in
last night's Miss USA pageant,

40:06.237 --> 40:08.238
who was asked about this very issue onstage

40:08.323 --> 40:10.491
and who believes her answer
was what kept her from winning.

40:10.617 --> 40:11.825
Thank you all for being here.

40:11.951 --> 40:12.993
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

40:13.078 --> 40:14.495
Will, I wanna be very clear,

40:14.621 --> 40:15.996
my answer didn't keep me from winning,

40:16.122 --> 40:17.831
it kept me from being first runner-up.

40:17.999 --> 40:19.792
- And we're off.
- Okay.

40:19.918 --> 40:22.252
Dr. Sotter, this is your field of expertise,

40:22.337 --> 40:23.462
so let's kick it off with you.

40:23.546 --> 40:25.964
What do you say to those
who argue that SB 1070

40:26.049 --> 40:29.551
is just targeting Americans on the basis
of skin color and nationality alone?

40:29.803 --> 40:31.136
Absolutely, Will.

40:31.971 --> 40:33.180
What would you say to them?

40:33.264 --> 40:34.640
I'd say absolutely.

40:34.724 --> 40:37.017
The bill does not target religion or Muslims

40:37.268 --> 40:39.770
or homosexuality, just illegal Mexicans.

40:40.522 --> 40:42.439
Well, yes, but you would also say, right,

40:42.524 --> 40:44.817
that the state legislature has taken great pains

40:44.901 --> 40:47.903
to ensure that it isn't a racial profiling law,

40:47.987 --> 40:50.781
even going so far as to amend it
to include the following language.

40:50.865 --> 40:51.949
Go 24.

40:52.033 --> 40:53.450
"Prosecutors would not investigate

40:53.535 --> 40:56.120
"complaints based on race, color
or national origin."

40:56.204 --> 40:57.454
That's right, just Mexicans.

40:58.540 --> 41:01.583
- Dr. Sotter...
- Forgive me, Will. Latinos and Latinas.

41:01.668 --> 41:04.419
And the argument that
we don't want to be a country

41:04.504 --> 41:07.339
that pulls people over and asks for
their papers based on how they look?

41:07.465 --> 41:09.258
Yeah, I don't like it any more than you do,

41:09.342 --> 41:14.138
but that wouldn't be the case
if it weren't for the Latinos and Latinas,

41:14.222 --> 41:17.307
el "criminelos," los "ilegatos."

41:17.392 --> 41:19.184
That's not Spanish.

41:19.769 --> 41:20.894
Gwen, let's go to you.

41:20.979 --> 41:22.604
You were asked last night
about the immigration law,

41:22.689 --> 41:24.606
and you said it was an issue of states' rights.

41:24.691 --> 41:26.024
And for that I paid a price.

41:26.568 --> 41:29.236
That notwithstanding,
you raised an interesting issue.

41:29.571 --> 41:33.365
This law will surely be challenged
in the courts on constitutional grounds.

41:33.575 --> 41:36.410
After all, states aren't allowed
to create their own foreign policy,

41:36.578 --> 41:38.745
but it sounds like you've got
the right answer to that.

41:38.830 --> 41:39.830
Which is...

41:39.914 --> 41:41.665
I'm a survivor
and I don't know the word "quit."

41:41.749 --> 41:43.208
- Probably other words, too.
- Shut it.

41:43.668 --> 41:47.129
States aren't allowed to create
their own foreign policy, but...

41:50.925 --> 41:53.677
But this isn't about foreign policy,
it's about law enforcement.

41:56.681 --> 41:58.473
Decades of federal inaction

41:58.558 --> 42:01.810
have led to a dangerous
and unstable situation on Arizona's border.

42:01.895 --> 42:05.314
And if the federal government can't
or won't act to uphold the law,

42:05.398 --> 42:08.442
then it's up to the states
to exercise their power and fill that void.

42:08.526 --> 42:10.903
I'm an Ameri-can, Will, not an Ameri-can't.

42:11.196 --> 42:12.654
- Let's dump out of it.
- Ross.

42:12.739 --> 42:14.114
- Yes.
- No, the whole thing, dump out of it.

42:14.199 --> 42:15.365
I'm gonna go ahead and assume

42:15.450 --> 42:17.367
that you're a supporter
of Second Amendment rights,

42:17.452 --> 42:19.745
judging by the rifle
you've placed in your live shot.

42:19.829 --> 42:20.871
Yes, sir.

42:20.955 --> 42:23.248
A frequent argument you hear
from gun rights advocates

42:23.333 --> 42:25.626
is that we don't need any more new laws,

42:25.710 --> 42:29.171
what we need is a government
to enforce the laws we already have.

42:29.255 --> 42:31.590
Couldn't the same be said
about immigration policy?

42:31.758 --> 42:32.799
Yes, sir.

42:33.801 --> 42:36.929
I'm saying you're a supporter
of the new law, right?

42:37.013 --> 42:38.805
- Yes, sir.
- I can't take my eyes off of it.

42:38.890 --> 42:40.098
Because?

42:43.102 --> 42:46.063
Because laws that are unwieldy
and unenforceable aren't laws at all.

42:46.147 --> 42:47.481
- I don't follow.
- Dump out of it.

42:47.565 --> 42:49.107
- And, Mr. McAdoo...
- McAvoy.

42:49.192 --> 42:50.651
- I beg your pardon?
- Doesn't matter.

42:50.735 --> 42:52.569
Why don't we just build a damn wall?

42:52.654 --> 42:54.571
The Chinese built one
and you can see it from space.

42:55.448 --> 42:57.074
- Are the Chinese better than us?
- No.

42:57.158 --> 42:58.242
Although there's an old saying,

42:58.326 --> 43:01.036
"Show me a 15-foot wall
and I'll show you a 16-foot ladder."

43:01.120 --> 43:02.621
Then let's just build a 17-foot wall.

43:02.705 --> 43:05.332
- Hell, build it 18 feet.
- Yes. Yep.

43:05.416 --> 43:07.501
- But you see their point, right?
- Whose point?

43:08.044 --> 43:09.336
The people who build ladders.

43:09.545 --> 43:11.922
- How about we get...
- I'm sorry, okay?

43:12.006 --> 43:14.758
- I'm sorry. Just dump out of it.
- Will, can I jump in?

43:14.842 --> 43:16.593
- She cannot jump in.
- Jump on in, Gwen.

43:16.678 --> 43:18.262
- I think we're creating an environment...
- Ugh!

43:18.346 --> 43:20.305
...where pageant contestants
are afraid to speak their minds

43:20.390 --> 43:23.350
when it comes to important
questions and whatnot,

43:23.643 --> 43:25.227
and that's not the America I grew up in.

43:25.311 --> 43:27.562
You're 20 years old.
It is the America you grew up in.

43:27.689 --> 43:29.606
- Not in Oklahoma.
- Especially in Oklahoma.

43:29.774 --> 43:31.066
But we're gonna have to leave it there.

43:31.150 --> 43:34.695
When we come back, Deepwater Horizon
sinks to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico.

43:35.071 --> 43:37.489
I envy it.

43:38.741 --> 43:41.034
With the White House
now getting offers of assistance

43:41.119 --> 43:43.453
from other countries
to help plug the gushing well.

43:43.538 --> 43:45.706
What's this new SOT? What's 907?

43:45.790 --> 43:47.666
- Will gave it to me last minute.
- What is it?

43:47.750 --> 43:49.126
It's Sarah Palin on the spill.

43:49.210 --> 43:51.670
Former Alaskan governor
and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin

43:51.754 --> 43:53.588
weighed in earlier today on Fox News.

43:53.673 --> 43:55.090
Go 907.

43:55.174 --> 43:57.217
Well, then, what the federal government
should have done

43:57.302 --> 44:00.470
was accept the assistance
of foreign countries,

44:00.555 --> 44:03.598
of entrepreneurial Americans
who have had solutions

44:03.683 --> 44:05.183
- that they wanted presented.
- Who?

44:05.268 --> 44:07.936
They can't even get
a phone call returned, Bill.

44:08.062 --> 44:09.396
The Dutch. They are known,

44:09.480 --> 44:12.232
in the Norwegian, they are known for dikes

44:12.317 --> 44:14.985
and for cleaning up water
and for dealing with spills.

44:15.069 --> 44:17.571
They offered to help, and yet, no, they, too,

44:17.739 --> 44:19.948
with the proverbial can't even
get a phone call back.

44:20.825 --> 44:23.493
Okay, what she was saying was that...

44:24.037 --> 44:25.120
All yours.

44:25.204 --> 44:28.206
Yes, okay, the Dutch live in Holland
and Norwegians live in Norway.

44:28.291 --> 44:30.417
That's a mistake that... People make that.

44:30.710 --> 44:35.047
And I think Governor Palin was referring
to an old fairy tale about a boy.

44:35.131 --> 44:37.674
She was saying that people were offering
to help, and that's great,

44:37.759 --> 44:39.593
and phone calls will be returned.

44:48.311 --> 44:50.604
William Duncan McAvoy.

44:51.147 --> 44:54.941
I think your parents wanted to make it
plainly understood that you are Anglo-Saxon.

44:55.193 --> 44:57.611
I came up to personally
apologize for tonight's show.

44:57.737 --> 44:59.112
The show kind of got away from you a little.

44:59.197 --> 45:00.614
It bordered on unprofessional.

45:01.115 --> 45:03.658
Here's unprofessional,
here's the border, and here's professional,

45:03.743 --> 45:05.619
and all the way back here is tonight's show.

45:06.329 --> 45:08.163
- It was my fault.
- Yeah.

45:08.915 --> 45:11.666
Did you know I got an e-mail
from MacKenzie today saying...

45:11.751 --> 45:14.044
God. Yeah. I forgot you were gonna see that.

45:14.128 --> 45:15.879
Know how many people
work at this company?

45:15.963 --> 45:18.173
Well, in the cable news division,
I guess about 350.

45:18.257 --> 45:20.050
178,000.

45:20.510 --> 45:24.054
Guys who sell jet engines got that e-mail.

45:24.138 --> 45:26.390
By the way, they also own a tabloid magazine.

45:36.901 --> 45:39.528
I'm inured to it, it happened.
How's gossip gonna be worse?

45:39.821 --> 45:42.447
It's been three years. Time hasn't helped?

45:45.368 --> 45:47.244
- No.
- I wish you had told me.

45:47.620 --> 45:48.912
What would you have said?

45:49.080 --> 45:50.997
- I'd have made you feel better.
- How?

45:51.082 --> 45:53.041
I don't know. I do it all the time.

45:56.295 --> 45:58.547
Get it together down there, fast.

45:59.006 --> 46:01.341
- Got it.
- One more thing.

46:02.552 --> 46:05.137
Your daily private meetings
with Reese are over.

46:05.388 --> 46:07.681
Charlie, I respect you more
than anyone I know,

46:07.765 --> 46:10.016
but I'm the one sitting in that chair.

46:11.602 --> 46:13.019
Yes, you are.

46:16.315 --> 46:20.235
People across America are watching Arizona,

46:20.611 --> 46:23.280
seeing how we implement this law,

46:23.364 --> 46:26.199
ready to jump on even the slightest misstep.

46:26.284 --> 46:29.035
Many opponents
aren't even waiting for that.

46:30.204 --> 46:31.580
You need a drink?

46:33.332 --> 46:34.332
Sure.

46:34.417 --> 46:37.252
There's a karaoke bar
down the street we go to.

46:37.336 --> 46:40.046
Drinks and appetizers are $3 until 9:00.

46:41.048 --> 46:42.048
It's 9:15.

46:42.133 --> 46:44.384
We sent an intern down at 8:55
to order 30 drinks

46:44.469 --> 46:47.012
and four platters of tuna jerky.

46:47.096 --> 46:49.306
The downside's the karaoke,

46:49.390 --> 46:51.349
but it's the only place nearby
that stays open late,

46:51.434 --> 46:53.185
unless you want to go to the theater district.

46:53.269 --> 46:55.854
I'd have thought the downside would be
the four platters of tuna jerky.

46:57.315 --> 46:58.732
It's an affordable dinner.

47:01.068 --> 47:02.986
Let's go.

47:11.078 --> 47:13.246
- Are you in or are you out?
- What?

47:14.081 --> 47:16.625
Are you in or are you out?

47:17.710 --> 47:18.752
Are we doing this, then?

47:18.836 --> 47:20.253
I don't understand.
Are you mad at me right now?

47:20.338 --> 47:22.214
Palin. How did Palin get into the rundown?

47:23.591 --> 47:25.342
First of all, I'm the EP. Don't slip...

47:25.426 --> 47:27.344
I'm the managing editor
and I don't need your permission...

47:27.428 --> 47:30.055
Yes, you do, and you didn't ask for it
'cause you knew you wouldn't get it.

47:30.640 --> 47:32.724
I made it clear that this show
isn't going to participate

47:32.808 --> 47:35.352
in the endless cycle
of co-dependency between Palin...

47:35.436 --> 47:37.020
- I know.
- And insult to injury.

47:37.104 --> 47:39.564
You twisted yourself into
a Windsor knot to save her.

47:40.775 --> 47:43.527
"I'm sure that
what the Governor meant was

47:43.611 --> 47:47.489
"that the Dutch living
in Norwegia have good ideas.

47:47.573 --> 47:49.241
"And since she has an intimate knowledge

47:49.325 --> 47:51.368
"of all calls going into
and out of the White House,

47:51.452 --> 47:54.871
"she's a credible source
on whether the Swedisians

47:54.956 --> 47:56.331
"have gotten their message returned."

47:56.457 --> 47:58.458
First of all, the impression, uncanny.

47:58.668 --> 48:00.877
I'm not the one who asked Victoria's Secret

48:00.962 --> 48:03.296
to do five minutes
of economic reporting every night.

48:03.381 --> 48:06.299
Victoria's Secret has
a PhD in economics from Duke

48:06.384 --> 48:08.093
and is an adjunct professor at Columbia.

48:08.177 --> 48:09.553
Are you in or are you out?

48:09.637 --> 48:11.346
I have to give you credit
for thinking you can chew me out

48:11.430 --> 48:13.807
- on this particular...
- I'll chew you out on any particular day.

48:13.891 --> 48:16.268
And by the way, when I say, "Dump out of it,"
dump out of it.

48:17.228 --> 48:18.895
Reese got in your head.

48:18.980 --> 48:23.316
And so you put the almost-one-term governor
of a state where nobody lives on our air.

48:23.401 --> 48:25.819
- I'm don't believe I'm hearing...
- Yes, we fucked up

48:26.279 --> 48:29.406
on a huge subject, but ours was a mistake.

48:29.490 --> 48:30.865
Yours was fear,

48:31.492 --> 48:34.494
a need to be loved by strangers
and not our show.

48:36.455 --> 48:38.039
Be the leader, Will.

48:38.541 --> 48:40.667
Be the moral center of this show.

48:42.503 --> 48:44.170
Be the integrity.

48:47.550 --> 48:48.842
Today's Friday.

48:50.094 --> 48:52.846
By Monday, I want to know
are you in or are you out?

49:02.023 --> 49:03.898
Does anyone believe I just got...

49:21.709 --> 49:23.043
We want to be the ones to do it.

49:23.878 --> 49:26.212
We want to be the ones to do 2.0.
We can do this.

49:32.637 --> 49:34.512
Give me a second.

49:41.437 --> 49:42.729
How you doing?

49:42.938 --> 49:45.315
I'm doing all right, all rings consisted...

49:45.399 --> 49:47.400
Considered.

49:47.485 --> 49:49.152
How much
have you had to drink?

49:49.236 --> 49:50.904
I won't lie to you, Don.

49:52.281 --> 49:53.740
- Yes?
- What?

49:53.866 --> 49:56.451
You said, "I won't lie to you, Don,"
and then you didn't say anything else.

49:56.535 --> 49:57.661
- I've had a drink.
- A whole one?

49:57.745 --> 49:59.537
- Yeah.
- That's too much for you.

49:59.622 --> 50:00.664
It is not.

50:01.290 --> 50:02.666
Come to 10:00.

50:03.584 --> 50:05.460
I really appreciate your offer,

50:05.544 --> 50:09.631
but I think you're offering it
because I'm your girlfriend.

50:09.799 --> 50:11.299
What's wrong with that?

50:12.093 --> 50:13.426
Ah, oh...

50:13.678 --> 50:16.054
You're supposed to say, "No, I'm not."

50:16.138 --> 50:18.014
You're just inexperienced. I will coach you up.

50:18.099 --> 50:20.558
I want to be a part of what Will and MacKenzie
are trying to do.

50:20.643 --> 50:22.102
Will and MacKenzie are gonna fail.

50:22.269 --> 50:24.771
Jesus Christ, what's...

50:24.855 --> 50:28.108
Just because the scenery fell down
doesn't mean it's not a good play.

50:28.567 --> 50:30.944
Yeah, I don't know what that meant,
but I'm not talking about tonight.

50:31.696 --> 50:33.238
Nobody's gonna watch a classroom.

50:33.322 --> 50:36.616
They'll either be bored or infuriated,
and you will bleed viewers.

50:36.701 --> 50:38.493
And my show with Elliot
will get moved to 8:00.

50:38.577 --> 50:40.495
And at that point, I don't know
that I'll be able to help you.

50:41.163 --> 50:42.580
It was your fault.

50:42.665 --> 50:43.707
Let's break up.

50:43.791 --> 50:45.875
- What did I do now?
- You were too supportive.

50:46.001 --> 50:49.170
- Maggie...
- I feel myself suffocating from your support.

50:49.255 --> 50:50.714
You want truth or support?

50:50.798 --> 50:52.882
Did you think I didn't know I fucked up?

50:52.967 --> 50:54.676
I've been saying it.

50:55.636 --> 50:58.722
I have $45,000 in student loans to pay off,

50:58.806 --> 51:00.515
I spend three weeks' take-home

51:00.599 --> 51:03.059
on half a one-bedroom apartment
the size of a tool shed,

51:03.144 --> 51:05.812
and I'm sitting alone at a bar
with a drink that was made an hour ago.

51:05.896 --> 51:07.772
A good day is
when I have quarters for a dryer.

51:07.857 --> 51:10.066
A bad day is when I blow a newscast.

51:10.151 --> 51:11.568
That's my spectrum.

51:13.571 --> 51:16.614
Support is what I wanted right then.

51:16.866 --> 51:19.159
And I think you're rooting for Will to fail.

51:19.744 --> 51:21.536
You just said it would be
in your best interest...

51:21.620 --> 51:22.620
Listen...

51:22.705 --> 51:24.831
And I know he's not
the cuddliest guy in the world,

51:25.249 --> 51:27.333
but he is trying to do good,

51:27.418 --> 51:29.794
and he's risking a lot to do it,
and you and Reese...

51:29.879 --> 51:32.589
Yeah, yeah. Let's break up.

51:32.965 --> 51:34.591
Don't, no, don't go like this.

51:34.675 --> 51:37.218
I'm sorry. I said the wrong thing.

51:38.512 --> 51:39.721
Don...

51:41.515 --> 51:43.475
Oh, I'm on fire today.

51:46.187 --> 51:48.521
- Evening, Mr. McAvoy.
- Good evening, Manny.

51:50.566 --> 51:52.275
We know how to live with our neighbors here.

51:52.359 --> 51:53.443
What's that?

51:53.527 --> 51:54.569
Your show tonight.

51:55.362 --> 51:56.654
I...

52:37.446 --> 52:38.738
You have to do a shot.

52:38.823 --> 52:40.490
I really only drink when I'm scared.

52:40.574 --> 52:44.744
I would like to have a word with you
right here and right now.

52:50.709 --> 52:51.709
Yes, ma'am.

52:51.794 --> 52:54.754
Don't "Yes, ma'am" me
with your sheepish charm.

52:54.839 --> 52:56.756
Would you like
to go someplace private?

52:56.841 --> 52:58.550
I... You covered for me.

52:58.634 --> 53:00.718
- Don't worry about it.
- I wasn't thanking you.

53:00.803 --> 53:03.513
You and Don,
why do you think I need protecting?

53:03.597 --> 53:05.723
You both like the fantasy of a girl in distress?

53:05.808 --> 53:08.226
- How about I put you in a cab?
- I take the subway.

53:08.310 --> 53:10.687
- Why do you think I need...
- I don't.

53:10.771 --> 53:12.647
But I cover for you, Mac covers for me,

53:12.731 --> 53:14.607
Will covers for everybody,
Charlie covers for Will.

53:14.692 --> 53:16.234
How come nobody's yelling at me?

53:16.402 --> 53:18.152
- You know how bad you screwed up, right?
- Yes.

53:18.237 --> 53:19.404
Is there anyone who feels worse than you do?

53:19.488 --> 53:20.488
No.

53:20.573 --> 53:21.698
Then I doubt it'll ever happen again.

53:24.285 --> 53:25.493
Let me give you money for a cab.

53:25.578 --> 53:28.496
No, I have to go to Don's apartment
and apologize.

53:29.081 --> 53:32.458
- For what?
- For suggesting he would...

53:32.543 --> 53:35.128
You know, for asking...

53:35.546 --> 53:36.921
I'll think of it on the way.

53:37.464 --> 53:40.133
We break up, I apologize, everything's fine.

53:40.426 --> 53:42.093
Sounds like a super-healthy relationship.

53:42.177 --> 53:44.095
- I'd fight for it.
- I will fight for it.

53:44.388 --> 53:46.890
And I'll make it work
through sheer force of will,

53:46.974 --> 53:48.975
just like MacKenzie will with Will,

53:49.059 --> 53:51.436
and just like I made
the immigration segment work.

53:51.520 --> 53:53.730
Will and MacKenzie
are going to kill each other,

53:53.814 --> 53:55.523
and the immigration segment
was a train wreck.

53:55.608 --> 53:57.984
You should shut up more than you do.
Do people tell you that?

53:59.320 --> 54:00.361
No.

54:00.863 --> 54:02.155
You're being polite.

54:05.993 --> 54:07.243
I still don't know why I'm being mean to you.

54:10.497 --> 54:11.706
Tess?

54:12.207 --> 54:14.167
- Would you?
- Yeah.

54:17.171 --> 54:19.881
- Sorry.
- Hang on, all of you.

54:21.675 --> 54:22.967
I'm your senior producer.

54:23.052 --> 54:25.762
Fuck up again like this, I'm gonna get mad.

54:30.476 --> 54:32.518
That's it. Take her to Don's place.

54:39.818 --> 54:42.570
- That was so awesome.
- Thank you.

54:42.655 --> 54:44.072
- Do a shot.
- No.

54:49.536 --> 54:50.828
- Hello?
- Neal, it's Will.

54:50.996 --> 54:53.539
- I hope you don't mind my calling so late.
- No.

54:54.333 --> 54:57.001
I got your number from,
you know, there's a booklet.

54:57.086 --> 54:58.962
- The office directory.
- Yeah.

54:59.046 --> 55:00.463
The guy you found in Spokane,

55:00.547 --> 55:01.839
I want you to get in touch with him

55:01.924 --> 55:03.466
and tell him that you're gonna pay for a cab

55:03.550 --> 55:04.842
to take him to and from work.

55:04.927 --> 55:07.136
He should send you the receipts,
then give them to me.

55:08.430 --> 55:09.472
Will...

55:10.099 --> 55:11.557
Come on, let me post this on your blog.

55:11.725 --> 55:13.184
- No.
- Will...

55:13.268 --> 55:15.812
- Keep my name out of it.
- Yes, sir.

55:16.605 --> 55:17.772
Is MacKenzie around there?

55:19.233 --> 55:20.441
Yeah.

55:20.526 --> 55:22.568
- Can you put her on the phone?
- Sure.

55:28.742 --> 55:30.243
It's Will.

55:36.750 --> 55:39.252
I'm sorry about everything.

55:39.461 --> 55:41.713
I'm just so sorry.

55:41.964 --> 55:43.589
- There's no way I can even...
- I'm in.

55:44.383 --> 55:46.926
- What?
- I'm in. I'll see you on Monday.

55:50.931 --> 55:53.599
- Are you still gonna worry about the ratings?
- Yes.

55:53.684 --> 55:56.436
- Still gonna worry about being popular?
- Yeah.

55:56.520 --> 55:57.979
About being loved by strangers?

55:58.063 --> 56:00.773
Are you gonna keep asking me questions
that all mean the same thing?

56:01.108 --> 56:02.817
Till I get the right answer.

56:04.278 --> 56:05.278
I'm in.

56:07.573 --> 56:08.781
There it is.
