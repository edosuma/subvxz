you said, Curtis.

was I don't do rap.

Oh, yeah, right.

His hands are cut and bloody,

on the ground here.

Here's another shock.
They left his stash.

not a robbery.

it was your idea to kick it.

RODGERS: You were right He
wasn't hit by that twit's SUV.

06:27.186 --> 06:30.292
Two blows. One to the face,
one to his left side.

06:31.090 --> 06:33.263
You're telling me somebody
killed him with two punches?

06:33.326 --> 06:34.862
Exsanguination.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.204
I love it when you
talk Latin, Rodgers.

06:37.263 --> 06:38.765
He bled to death.

06:38.831 --> 06:42.301
One blow ruptured his spleen.
Died maybe an hour later.

06:42.969 --> 06:44.642
That's one hell of a punch.

06:44.704 --> 06:46.980
He had Gaucher's disease.

06:47.039 --> 06:48.609
That means you bleed easily,

06:48.674 --> 06:50.210
bruise easily, fracture easily.

06:50.276 --> 06:52.449
And it makes the spleen swell.

06:52.512 --> 06:54.082
I talked to Curtis' doctor,

06:54.147 --> 06:57.720
he was scheduled to have his
spleen removed next Tuesday.

06:58.484 --> 06:59.519
Was he partying?

06:59.585 --> 07:01.587
'Cause we found cocaine
and pills in his studio.

07:01.654 --> 07:02.860
Nope. He tested clean,

07:02.922 --> 07:05.528
unless you count
pain meds and Epogen.

07:06.192 --> 07:09.401
(SIGHS) The guy was beyond
fragile, he was brittle.

07:11.564 --> 07:14.568
Maybe that's why the crime
scene was so poorly staged.

07:14.634 --> 07:16.671
Whoever he was with didn't
know about his condition.

07:16.736 --> 07:19.114
Curtis went down fast,
the killer panicked.

07:19.172 --> 07:22.176
Maybe.
Or maybe the killer knew,

07:22.241 --> 07:24.118
and aimed right
for his soft spot.

07:24.744 --> 07:26.621
You're a half-glass-empty
kind of guy, aren't you?

07:26.879 --> 07:28.449
Depends what's in it, Wheeler.

07:29.582 --> 07:33.325
Curtis was working late the night he died.
Studios keep logs.

07:33.586 --> 07:35.088
Let's track who his
last session was with.

07:36.589 --> 07:37.897
Let's do that.

07:39.225 --> 07:42.399
MAY: We just started working
together two months ago.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.237
Curtis was a genius.

07:44.397 --> 07:46.502
You know he had two MTV awards?

07:47.166 --> 07:48.804
Are you new in town?

07:50.570 --> 07:52.413
Everybody
asks me that. Um...

07:52.705 --> 07:55.345
My husband and I moved here from
Mount Carmel, Pennsylvania.

07:55.775 --> 07:57.015
You're a long way from home.

07:57.610 --> 07:59.248
Have a seat, May.

08:01.781 --> 08:06.230
My husband Zak, his dad
died, left a VA policy.

08:07.153 --> 08:11.033
Zak's dream, our dream, is for
me to make it as a singer.

08:11.958 --> 08:15.872
Zak said now's our chance, and I met
Curtis here and said he wanted to help.

08:16.462 --> 08:19.170
Curtis was single.
Did he have a girlfriend?

08:20.366 --> 08:21.401
No.

08:22.401 --> 08:24.847
Curtis was in that studio
from morning to midnight.

08:25.104 --> 08:27.106
So, your relationship was

08:28.641 --> 08:30.018
strictly professional, right?

08:30.910 --> 08:31.980
You mean...

08:34.113 --> 08:35.490
God, no, I'm married.

08:35.780 --> 08:37.919
You're married, he's single.

08:38.284 --> 08:41.059
How'd your husband feel about you
working late nights together?

08:42.922 --> 08:47.735
My husband Zak, he... He
thought Curtis was a... gay.

08:48.060 --> 08:50.631
So, I kind of let him think that
just so he wouldn't worry for me.

08:51.898 --> 08:54.139
You remember the last time
you worked with Curtis?

08:54.467 --> 08:57.311
Sure. Thursday night,
the night he...

09:00.840 --> 09:02.319
We were supposed to
work together until 9:00,

09:02.375 --> 09:05.686
but friends of his kept
stopping by, so we ended early.

09:05.745 --> 09:07.349
Do these friends have names?

09:08.614 --> 09:12.255
Seamus something. He owns Spire,
the club across the street.

09:12.785 --> 09:14.389
Seamus Flaherty?

09:14.554 --> 09:15.862
MAY: You know him?

09:15.922 --> 09:18.095
Short guy, lot of mileage?

09:18.858 --> 09:20.531
And his girlfriend, Brook.

09:20.593 --> 09:22.800
And one of the club's bouncers,

09:22.862 --> 09:26.503
I don't know his name,
but he's a big black guy.

09:27.366 --> 09:28.936
Any arguments
with these friends?

09:29.302 --> 09:30.838
The bouncer was pretty angry.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.678
He kind of made me nervous.

09:32.738 --> 09:35.912
He had a CD that
he wanted Curtis to play,

09:36.609 --> 09:38.145
and Curtis told him
he was through with rap.

09:42.181 --> 09:43.353
Drugs.

09:43.649 --> 09:45.094
That's why Curtis
made everyone leave.

09:45.151 --> 09:49.293
He said, "Party's over. Get that
crap out of here," to Seamus.

09:53.726 --> 09:55.069
Thank you.

09:56.195 --> 09:57.401
Logan!

09:57.463 --> 10:00.000
How come I never see you
with the same partner twice?

10:00.066 --> 10:02.103
Flaherty and I go way back.

10:02.168 --> 10:05.445
To one of the first murders
in one of his many bars.

10:05.504 --> 10:07.950
There's been so many, he
probably can't keep track.

10:08.975 --> 10:10.045
We're unlucky.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.554
Kennedys are unlucky.

10:12.378 --> 10:13.789
He tell you about
the cop he shot?

10:14.780 --> 10:17.727
We were talking about Curtis Gold's
murder and the coke vial you left.

10:17.984 --> 10:21.090
Me? No.
My date was young,

10:21.153 --> 10:23.360
it was inappropriate of her
to have brought out the coke.

10:23.522 --> 10:26.867
Curtis had a problem, which I
did not have a problem with.

10:26.926 --> 10:27.996
She's gone.

10:28.194 --> 10:29.764
We understand
one of your bouncers

10:29.829 --> 10:31.968
was also at Curtis'
studio Thursday night.

10:32.064 --> 10:35.136
I don't recall. So much
chaos with the accident.

10:35.868 --> 10:36.938
Tragic night.

10:37.003 --> 10:38.914
Come on, Flaherty,
after all these years,

10:38.971 --> 10:41.918
you think it's in your
interest to lie to the NYPD?

10:42.642 --> 10:46.385
One of your bouncers, a big,
threatening black guy...

10:46.445 --> 10:49.119
Whoa! Your partner's
a dinosaur here.

10:49.448 --> 10:51.792
Curtis was helping
this guy with a rap CD.

10:52.685 --> 10:53.720
That could be Goro.

10:53.786 --> 10:54.924
How about a real name?

10:55.087 --> 10:56.794
Far as I know,
that is his real name.

10:56.856 --> 10:58.529
I haven't seen him
since Thursday night.

10:58.824 --> 11:00.235
No idea where he is.

11:00.292 --> 11:03.273
If I hear from Goro, though,
you'll be the first I call.

11:04.430 --> 11:06.171
Will you excuse me?

11:10.269 --> 11:11.646
"Goro"?
(SCOFFS)

11:14.940 --> 11:18.012
Hey! I know you. You worked
the door last night.

11:18.210 --> 11:19.553
Tough one.

11:19.845 --> 11:22.792
We're lookin' for one of
your co-workers. Goro?

11:22.848 --> 11:24.759
Goro? Don't know him.

11:25.418 --> 11:28.160
We got 20 guys workin'
security, give or take.

11:28.220 --> 11:31.292
Why do you guys always gotta
be so difficult? Huh?

11:31.357 --> 11:33.098
Gonna ask you one more time.

11:33.159 --> 11:35.366
Who was the black guy
workin' the door,

11:35.428 --> 11:36.998
holdin' back the
crowd last night?

11:37.396 --> 11:39.603
I keep to myself
on the job. Sorry.

11:40.366 --> 11:41.743
Logan, he's afraid of him.

11:42.601 --> 11:44.945
Big mountain of a guy like you?
That can't be true.

11:48.074 --> 11:51.521
Last week, Goro had the
kitchen makin' him an omelet.

11:51.744 --> 11:55.089
Egg whites he wanted.
He got yolks instead.

11:56.148 --> 11:58.685
Goro went all kung fu on
him, broke both his arms.

12:00.152 --> 12:02.154
We think Goro's
involved in a murder.

12:02.221 --> 12:03.256
We make the case against him,

12:03.322 --> 12:05.097
he's off your door,
out of your life.

12:11.330 --> 12:14.209
You gonna talk to him?
Might wanna bring back-up.

12:16.035 --> 12:17.776
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

12:20.072 --> 12:21.710
(KIDS CHATTERING)

12:26.545 --> 12:28.991
Kids. Great.

12:40.926 --> 12:44.100
Mr. Goro! Police!

12:46.365 --> 12:47.605
Please don't move.

12:56.742 --> 12:58.050
Welcome.

12:59.178 --> 13:01.715
I'm ready to join
your investigation.

13:10.890 --> 13:13.131
Goro is the name I gave myself.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.966
The symbol for crisis,
is two symbols.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.207
Danger and opportunity.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.039
Goro means crisis?

13:21.834 --> 13:25.043
It means I see
opportunity in danger.

13:27.006 --> 13:28.644
I study Chinese philosophy.

13:29.241 --> 13:30.720
Martial arts.

13:30.943 --> 13:34.413
I'm ready to defend
my street, my City.

13:34.947 --> 13:36.790
(CHUCKLES) So, you're like
the Batman of bouncers, huh?

13:40.085 --> 13:43.362
Anyway, Thursday night you
pay a visit to Curtis Gold?

13:43.422 --> 13:45.800
I wanted him
to listen to my CD.

13:45.858 --> 13:48.395
But I interrupted his work,
which I regret.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.029
I did not stay.

13:50.496 --> 13:53.170
He said he was through with rap
music and didn't like your music.

13:53.232 --> 13:54.575
That had to piss you off.

13:54.633 --> 13:56.943
Curtis just needed
to listen to it.

13:57.303 --> 14:00.477
Because of this killer,
he won't get that chance.

14:01.640 --> 14:02.948
And I won't get mine.

14:03.242 --> 14:06.280
So you're basically saying you had
no motive to kill him, correct?

14:06.579 --> 14:08.286
Of course not.

14:08.347 --> 14:10.349
But my guilt is not at issue.

14:13.752 --> 14:16.892
Mr. Goro, we think
whoever killed Curtis,

14:16.956 --> 14:18.435
it wasn't a purposeful act.

14:18.490 --> 14:20.197
It might be that someone,

14:20.259 --> 14:22.068
maybe upset about a rejection,

14:22.127 --> 14:25.165
threw a punch that caused more
damage than anyone could have known.

14:25.231 --> 14:26.301
Does that make sense?

14:26.799 --> 14:28.574
I'm working on the same theory.

14:29.735 --> 14:31.442
The sooner I get back
to my investigation,

14:31.503 --> 14:34.313
the sooner Curtis' death
shall be avenged.

14:35.741 --> 14:37.243
I must go now.

14:39.078 --> 14:40.853
I must protect my block.

14:42.047 --> 14:43.651
Okay.

14:45.150 --> 14:46.458
Hold that thought, okay?

14:49.788 --> 14:52.029
Unless he threatened someone
else, we can't hold him.

14:52.858 --> 14:55.099
Well, he's crazy as a loon.

14:55.327 --> 14:56.635
If we send him back
out on the street,

14:56.695 --> 14:59.107
he's going to hunt
for Curtis' killer.

14:59.164 --> 15:01.007
Boy, that's a mess
I don't wanna clean up.

15:01.066 --> 15:03.774
I thought you said
he is Curtis' killer.

15:05.671 --> 15:08.675
Well, we're not sure. He may
be or he may know who it is.

15:08.741 --> 15:09.776
Motive?

15:09.842 --> 15:11.788
Well, motive?
Look at him.

15:12.278 --> 15:15.418
I mean, he's at
his tipping point.

15:16.982 --> 15:19.861
The guy's gonna do a black
Rambo on the streets.

15:23.155 --> 15:26.602
Wheeler, is he dangerous?

15:29.128 --> 15:32.302
I'd say yes. But he didn't
make an explicit threat,

15:32.364 --> 15:33.434
we can hold him on.

15:33.499 --> 15:37.242
You heard him, Wheeler. "Curtis'
death shall be avenged."

15:38.504 --> 15:40.347
You don't call that a threat?

15:40.973 --> 15:42.919
Could be. Or could be
the plot of one of

15:42.975 --> 15:46.184
the Mortal Kombat video
games he got his name from.

15:47.746 --> 15:51.956
Under his real name, he has no
rap sheet, no medical history,

15:53.652 --> 15:55.325
and I bet he has an alibi.

15:55.688 --> 16:00.034
Four of his fellow bouncers confirmed that
he was on the door from 9:00 p.m. on.

16:00.092 --> 16:02.834
And if you worked for him,
you'd confirm his alibi, too.

16:02.895 --> 16:04.374
Detective, what do you
want me to do?

16:04.430 --> 16:08.503
Ask the D.A. to hold him on suspicion
of being a large, scary black man?

16:08.567 --> 16:09.910
Oh, come on, man.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.972
Fine. You still
have to street him.

16:13.038 --> 16:14.711
You come up
with something else,

16:14.773 --> 16:16.411
you can take
another shot at him.

16:20.245 --> 16:22.122
No point in going back
to Flaherty?

16:22.181 --> 16:25.993
He's coverin' for him. Whatever
Goro did, Flaherty's in on it.

16:27.786 --> 16:29.026
We got a hit on the coke vial.

16:29.088 --> 16:32.001
Flaherty's girlfriend,
Miss Brook St. Clair.

16:32.324 --> 16:34.326
She's on parole,
maybe wants to talk.

16:34.393 --> 16:36.373
Brook St. Clair?

16:37.329 --> 16:39.138
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

16:42.634 --> 16:45.581
I told you I didn't see
anything that night.

16:45.637 --> 16:48.447
Seamus, Goro and me all left
Curtis' club at the same time.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.453
I went to my shift here.
I swear.

16:50.509 --> 16:53.388
Well, you left out the part about
why Curtis kicked you out.

16:54.613 --> 16:56.251
The party favors!

16:57.349 --> 16:59.022
Who told you that?
Seamus?

16:59.084 --> 17:01.860
It's your prints on the vial,
Brook, you're the one on parole.

17:01.920 --> 17:05.026
So, about that argument
between Goro and Curtis?

17:06.858 --> 17:08.736
Look, I don't wanna
badmouth that guy.

17:08.794 --> 17:10.796
And we don't wanna
bring you in.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.532
You just don't know
what'll set him off.

17:14.599 --> 17:17.512
This one time, this big gavone
spilled a drink on my pants,

17:17.569 --> 17:19.445
and Goro threw him out
on the street.

17:19.505 --> 17:21.108
From the second story!

17:21.740 --> 17:23.810
I don't remember there
being windows at Spire.

17:23.876 --> 17:27.289
Not Spire, the last club I worked.
Leather and Lace.

17:27.445 --> 17:28.686
That's where I met Seamus.

17:29.081 --> 17:31.459
Leather and Lace.
Who ran that?

17:31.950 --> 17:33.122
Little Paddy Egan.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.623
And Goro was the bouncer there?

17:37.089 --> 17:38.625
When?
Last year.

17:39.425 --> 17:40.733
Before he went to Spire.

17:41.427 --> 17:44.670
It's too bad, too, 'cause
when Goro worked the floor,

17:44.730 --> 17:46.300
nobody bothered us twice.

17:51.170 --> 17:52.945
Who's Little Paddy Egan?

17:53.005 --> 17:55.042
Flaherty's brother-in-law.

17:55.107 --> 17:57.917
Leather and Lace, it's another
Flaherty family jewel.

17:57.976 --> 17:59.785
Hmm, sounds familiar.

17:59.978 --> 18:03.721
Double homicide in the basement
next door last Christmas Eve.

18:04.149 --> 18:06.527
Two club patrons, drug dealers.

18:06.585 --> 18:09.794
Shot execution style.
Case is still open.

18:10.189 --> 18:13.136
And shortly thereafter,
Goro transfers to Spire

18:13.192 --> 18:15.536
where Curtis Gold
is found dead.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.574
It's a nice coincidence,
but the MO's are different,

18:17.629 --> 18:19.131
and we still don't have
a motive for Goro.

18:19.198 --> 18:21.872
Maybe because they're
not Goro's motives.

18:21.934 --> 18:25.381
Maybe Flaherty's runnin' a one-man
execution staff on his payroll.

18:25.437 --> 18:27.314
Set him off, watch him go.

18:27.372 --> 18:29.443
Should we keep
Captain in the loop?

18:29.508 --> 18:31.510
He's your rabbi, not mine.

18:33.712 --> 18:36.022
MAN: (RAPPING ON STEREO) My mind
they try to trap I keep with the rap

18:36.081 --> 18:38.254
It's more than paranoia
got me needing the strap

18:38.317 --> 18:40.957
I can feel the disease
in the belly of the beast

18:41.019 --> 18:42.054
Power to the people

18:42.121 --> 18:43.600
Now, it's time
to grab your piece

18:43.655 --> 18:46.101
<i>Watch when I bust,
start kicking up dust</i>

18:46.158 --> 18:48.365
There ain't no army
that's ready to deal with us

18:48.427 --> 18:51.101
Whatever time is left
for my lungs to take a breath

18:51.163 --> 18:53.404
Best believe
I'm ridin'...to death

18:53.465 --> 18:56.071
I can feel the disease
in the belly of the beast

18:56.135 --> 18:57.273
Power to the people

18:57.336 --> 18:58.508
Now, it's time
to grab your piece

18:58.570 --> 19:01.016
I can feel the disease
in the belly of the beast

19:01.073 --> 19:02.177
Power to the people

19:02.241 --> 19:03.743
Now, it's time
to grab your piece...

19:03.809 --> 19:06.153
Well, he's not
dressing to blend.

19:10.082 --> 19:13.086
Jeff! Tell Seamus
Goro is here.

19:13.218 --> 19:14.356
He didn't come in today.

19:14.753 --> 19:15.925
I will tell him myself.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.661
Come on, Goro,
let's... (GRUNTS)

19:17.856 --> 19:19.096
Oh, that's not good.

19:19.158 --> 19:22.264
Don't take a bullet
that is not meant for you.

19:23.395 --> 19:24.669
Gun!
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

19:24.730 --> 19:26.403
Goro! Hands in the air!

19:27.232 --> 19:28.540
Hands in the air!

19:37.376 --> 19:40.721
Bouncers aren't allowed to carry
weapons, Goro, you know that.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.354
You're kidding.

19:44.416 --> 19:46.191
Criminal possession
of a weapon.

19:46.818 --> 19:48.195
That's the only charge
that'll stick.

19:48.253 --> 19:52.201
Mr. Goro didn't have his gun
out, he wasn't brandishing it.

19:52.257 --> 19:54.134
Well, gee, well, next time
wait until he shoots,

19:54.193 --> 19:55.831
and then you can
charge him with murder.

19:55.894 --> 19:57.168
ROSS: Logan...

19:57.229 --> 20:00.005
Well, do me a favor, would you?
Don't let him post bail.

20:00.065 --> 20:03.410
Detective Logan believes Goro was
involved in the Curtis Gold murder.

20:03.468 --> 20:05.209
Maybe the Leather and Lace
homicides, too.

20:05.270 --> 20:06.544
He worked there last year.

20:06.939 --> 20:08.919
Why am I just now
finding out about this?

20:09.641 --> 20:11.450
We wanted to wait
for ballistics.

20:12.177 --> 20:15.852
Turns out, Goro's gun is a match
for the Christmas Eve executions.

20:20.018 --> 20:21.656
I'm not saying anything.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.202
I don't deny this.

20:26.525 --> 20:28.698
I made them kneel and I
shot them in their heads.

20:30.262 --> 20:32.572
They sold drugs and
defiled women in my club.

20:32.631 --> 20:34.668
It was a just thing to do.

20:34.866 --> 20:37.642
Goro, how did you know they sold drugs?
Did someone tell you?

20:38.003 --> 20:39.380
Mr. Flaherty.

20:39.438 --> 20:42.214
He also told me they were
disrespecting our dancers.

20:43.675 --> 20:46.849
Okay, that's good.
That's good, Goro.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.483
Yeah, you can really
help yourself out here.

20:49.548 --> 20:53.655
So tell us, did Flaherty
ask you to shoot them?

20:53.986 --> 20:57.866
He didn't need to.
I knew what had to be done.

20:58.156 --> 20:59.863
For the sake of justice!

21:04.496 --> 21:05.702
Okay.

21:06.865 --> 21:09.106
And the next man
you killed, Curtis Gold.

21:09.434 --> 21:12.210
No, I did not kill Curtis.

21:19.011 --> 21:21.150
He gave me notes on my songs.

21:24.549 --> 21:25.721
But he turned you down
that night.

21:25.784 --> 21:27.354
He said he wasn't
into rap music.

21:27.419 --> 21:29.160
He did not disrespect me.

21:29.221 --> 21:32.100
WHEELER: Maybe Seamus
Flaherty put you up to it.

21:32.157 --> 21:35.400
Did he ask you to punch Curtis because
Curtis refused to help his girlfriend?

21:35.627 --> 21:37.629
I would never hurt Curtis.

21:38.096 --> 21:40.076
He came into the club
I took care of him,

21:40.132 --> 21:42.271
I made sure he got his table.

21:42.334 --> 21:46.646
Mr. Flaherty always said, "Always
take care of our investors."

21:47.906 --> 21:50.216
I did not kill Curtis Gold.

22:00.452 --> 22:01.522
WHEELER: Goro was right.

22:01.586 --> 22:05.193
Curtis Gold was a silent partner in Spire.
Flaherty burned him.

22:05.257 --> 22:07.635
That gives Curtis the
motive, not Flaherty.

22:07.693 --> 22:09.172
What about Leather and Lace?

22:09.227 --> 22:10.672
Anything there
implicate Seamus?

22:10.729 --> 22:12.504
No, Goro's totin'
that whole load.

22:12.564 --> 22:14.976
He's completely loyal
to Flaherty.

22:15.133 --> 22:17.340
Well, loyalty's a one-way
street with Flaherty.

22:17.402 --> 22:20.008
Squeeze him a bit on the
money, something may come out.

22:20.072 --> 22:22.882
Really?
Goro a stone killer?

22:23.909 --> 22:25.718
Man, you just never know.

22:25.777 --> 22:27.848
You knew Goro had
his own moral code.

22:27.913 --> 22:28.983
His own sense of justice.

22:29.047 --> 22:30.617
What did you think he would
do when you told him

22:30.682 --> 22:33.526
your two clients from Leather
and Lace insulted the dancers?

22:33.585 --> 22:35.963
It's hardly
a solicitation of murder.

22:36.021 --> 22:37.364
It got results.
For Goro, too.

22:37.422 --> 22:38.457
Just a week after the shooting

22:38.523 --> 22:39.627
he was working
for you at Spire.

22:39.691 --> 22:43.264
Goro was telling the girls that there was...
What do you call it?

22:43.328 --> 22:45.604
That they were
debasing themselves.

22:45.664 --> 22:47.439
Who needs a monk
in a strip club?

22:47.499 --> 22:49.240
We transferred him,
end of story.

22:49.301 --> 22:52.009
Detectives, unless you have
something substantive,

22:52.070 --> 22:53.606
I'd say end of interrogation.

22:53.805 --> 22:55.045
By the way, Curtis Gold

22:55.107 --> 22:56.745
you were with him the night
he was murdered, right?

22:56.808 --> 23:00.187
Yeah. I told you that. And I told
you he was alive when I left him.

23:00.245 --> 23:01.349
Mmm.

23:01.413 --> 23:03.051
What you didn't tell us was
Curtis was about to file

23:03.115 --> 23:05.595
a million dollar lawsuit
against you for fraud.

23:05.650 --> 23:06.890
(SCOFFS)

23:07.052 --> 23:10.033
You think this is about Curtis
getting his money back?

23:10.088 --> 23:11.658
From a nightclub?

23:11.723 --> 23:12.895
If I was gonna kill everyone

23:12.958 --> 23:15.302
who was upset about losing their
money in the bar business,

23:15.360 --> 23:17.362
I wouldn't have enough time
to run my club.

23:17.429 --> 23:20.035
Yeah, but the thing is, your clubs
are losing money, but you're not.

23:20.098 --> 23:23.375
You got a condo on Perry Street
and a house in Westhampton?

23:23.969 --> 23:25.471
You a detective or a CPA?

23:25.604 --> 23:27.709
The Mayor wants the Chelsea
club scene cleaned up.

23:27.773 --> 23:32.222
If the state liquor authority won't
do its job, maybe a city audit will.

23:36.214 --> 23:38.023
Worked for Al Capone.

23:40.552 --> 23:41.587
Yeah.

23:41.653 --> 23:43.826
Look, my client had
absolutely nothing to do

23:43.889 --> 23:45.698
with the death of Curtis Gold,

23:46.258 --> 23:47.669
but in a spirit of cooperation,

23:47.726 --> 23:49.364
he's willing to give you
some information.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.463
About Goro?

23:50.529 --> 23:53.135
I told you he was with me
when I left.

23:53.865 --> 23:58.109
The one who wasn't was
May from Pennsylvania.

23:59.671 --> 24:02.208
She and Curtis were having
a, you know, an affair.

24:03.408 --> 24:06.355
May Daltrie? She said
Curtis was all about work.

24:06.411 --> 24:08.652
Yeah, Curtis? Come on.

24:08.713 --> 24:09.783
Maybe she told you that.

24:09.848 --> 24:13.057
But those little runts, those are
the ones you gotta watch for.

24:13.118 --> 24:15.098
The two of 'em
used to come into Spire.

24:15.153 --> 24:18.066
So did you see them
touch, kiss?

24:18.423 --> 24:21.700
No. But I'm behind a bar
my whole life.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.270
Think I don't know when something's
goin' on that shouldn't be goin' on?

24:24.329 --> 24:26.400
Is that it? A
bartender's intuition?

24:26.465 --> 24:28.775
No. Check out
Curtis' studio.

24:29.067 --> 24:30.740
She bought him atrophy,

24:30.802 --> 24:34.215
a little plastic thing says
"World's Best Producer."

24:34.272 --> 24:36.343
I saw it in the booth
when I was there that night.

24:36.708 --> 24:37.812
Gee, that's hot.

24:37.876 --> 24:39.446
Well, then you turn it over.

24:39.511 --> 24:43.323
And it says, "Because you're mine.
Love, May."

24:46.885 --> 24:48.831
May, you wanna offer
these people something?

24:48.987 --> 24:50.364
Sure, um...

24:50.889 --> 24:53.733
Oh, coffee, black.
Can I help you?

24:53.992 --> 24:56.268
She's fine.
Have a seat.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.571
I'm sure you been
workin' all day like me.

25:00.632 --> 25:02.077
Yeah. Construction?

25:02.501 --> 25:04.447
Yup. Had my own business
back home,

25:04.503 --> 25:07.950
but you go somewhere new, you gotta
prove yourself all over again.

25:08.173 --> 25:09.243
Tell me about it.

25:09.307 --> 25:11.048
But we're in for the long haul.

25:11.109 --> 25:13.521
When May makes it,
it'll all be worth it.

25:14.646 --> 25:19.459
Sol heard you guys
arrested the... bouncer.

25:20.318 --> 25:23.231
We did, but it turns out he didn't kill Curtis.
That's why we're here.

25:24.356 --> 25:27.269
Really? Everyone on the block was
scared of him, I just assumed.

25:27.325 --> 25:29.032
WHEELER: So did we,
but he didn't do it.

25:29.094 --> 25:33.406
So we're hoping you or Zak can shed
some light onto Curtis' personal life.

25:33.465 --> 25:35.138
His personal life,

25:35.333 --> 25:37.108
well, gee, I only met him once.

25:37.168 --> 25:38.841
Curtis and I mostly
just talked about music.

25:39.371 --> 25:42.978
Curtis called my songs "cow
punk." Country-rock mix.

25:43.041 --> 25:44.816
Yeah, whatever you call it,

25:44.876 --> 25:46.822
May is gonna be a star.

25:46.878 --> 25:48.915
She has got
the voice of an angel.

25:50.715 --> 25:52.251
So Curtis was gay, huh?

25:52.984 --> 25:54.657
Yup, seemed gay to me.

25:56.454 --> 25:57.592
You met him once,
you could tell.

25:57.656 --> 26:01.502
Well, the way he dressed Never had a wife.
We put it together.

26:02.394 --> 26:03.998
May, did Curtis
ever hit on you?

26:06.665 --> 26:07.700
Gosh, no.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.774
Truth be told, we didn't
know Curtis well at all.

26:14.239 --> 26:15.377
Is there anything else?

26:17.108 --> 26:18.781
Yeah, where were you
the night of the murder?

26:19.210 --> 26:20.689
Just for the record.

26:21.246 --> 26:23.658
Zak picked me up
and we went home.

26:23.882 --> 26:25.190
We watched a DVD.

26:25.584 --> 26:26.756
Anything good?

26:26.985 --> 26:28.555
Oh, uh, Walk the Line.

26:28.787 --> 26:31.324
Oh, yeah, that's
the Johnny Cash bio.

26:32.824 --> 26:33.928
Did you like it?

26:34.960 --> 26:36.997
I didn't like it much, no.

26:40.432 --> 26:44.710
I don't think he'd suspect a scrawny guy
like Curtis was gonna seduce his wife.

26:48.039 --> 26:50.883
Unless a friend on the
block tipped him off.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.081
Jeff the bouncer?

26:53.478 --> 26:56.789
You think all white guys
who chew tobacco are buddies?

26:56.848 --> 26:59.192
In Chelsea? Yeah.

27:01.252 --> 27:02.925
Zak's good people.

27:03.455 --> 27:06.299
He always picked up May
outside the studio.

27:06.358 --> 27:08.895
She usually worked late, so
he'd wait for her at the bar.

27:08.960 --> 27:12.339
Talked about her singing
career, how talented she was.

27:13.064 --> 27:16.511
He didn't just love her. It
was like he worshiped her.

27:16.568 --> 27:19.708
Yeah, well, if you ask me, he
loved her a little too much.

27:19.771 --> 27:21.546
I mean, he was blind
to what was goin' on.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.342
That's what I thought.

27:23.408 --> 27:26.184
He gave up everything for her, and
she gives herself up to that runt.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.924
Yeah, and I bet everybody at the
club was laughin' about it.

27:28.980 --> 27:30.516
It was gettin' bad.

27:30.582 --> 27:31.993
Seamus and Brook
was jokin' about it

27:32.050 --> 27:33.961
when they came back
from Curtis' that night.

27:34.252 --> 27:35.595
How come nobody warned him?

27:35.654 --> 27:36.860
I tried.

27:37.088 --> 27:38.931
I said, "Just 'cause
Curtis is puny"

27:38.990 --> 27:40.799
"doesn't mean you should
trust him with your wife."

27:43.595 --> 27:45.336
I'll tell you what.

27:45.830 --> 27:48.242
If it was me,
I'd have kicked his ass.

27:49.167 --> 27:51.443
No. He was real calm.

27:51.870 --> 27:53.850
He goes, "if he tries anything",

27:53.905 --> 27:55.816
"I'll scare Curtis so bad
he won't try twice."

27:58.009 --> 28:00.546
But by "scare,"
he meant talk to him.

28:01.946 --> 28:03.050
Yeah.

28:04.249 --> 28:06.092
ZAK: Should you people
have a warrant?

28:06.151 --> 28:07.528
You got nothin' to hide, right?

28:08.019 --> 28:09.430
No, of course not.

28:09.487 --> 28:10.522
So?

28:12.323 --> 28:15.133
Are they gonna go through May's personals?
She'll skin me alive.

28:15.827 --> 28:17.636
I'll give 'em a hand.

28:18.430 --> 28:21.274
So what's May gonna do next?

28:21.332 --> 28:23.073
ZAK: I guess we're gonna
find another producer.

28:23.134 --> 28:25.136
I mean, May can't just
give up her singing

28:25.203 --> 28:27.205
just 'cause this guy
Curtis ends up dead.

28:27.272 --> 28:28.842
Yeah. Tough business, huh?

28:29.340 --> 28:30.819
ZAK: Pretty tough,
we're learnin'.

28:30.875 --> 28:31.979
Yeah.

28:32.043 --> 28:34.023
But May's too good to quit,
she's gonna be a star.

28:34.079 --> 28:35.285
We'll find another way.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.558
Zak, what's going on?

28:38.616 --> 28:41.028
I told 'em we got
nothin' to hide.

28:43.855 --> 28:44.925
What's that?

28:44.989 --> 28:47.526
Stolen from Curtis' studio
the night he was killed.

28:47.592 --> 28:49.162
"Because you're mine,
Love, May."

28:49.694 --> 28:51.640
"You're mine"? What the
hell does that mean?

28:52.430 --> 28:56.276
A joke.
Just "You're my producer."

28:56.801 --> 28:59.782
I was just trying to show him
that I was grateful, that's all.

28:59.838 --> 29:01.784
I think it was a little
more than grateful.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.751
According to
the gang at the club.

29:04.476 --> 29:06.046
Don't listen to him, Zak.

29:06.111 --> 29:07.454
WHEELER: He knows
all about it, May.

29:07.512 --> 29:09.082
We got a witness who
quotes Zak as saying,

29:09.147 --> 29:11.184
"I'll scare Curtis so bad
he won't try twice."

29:11.249 --> 29:12.922
That's on the night
of the murder.

29:13.384 --> 29:15.091
No. Zak.

29:15.153 --> 29:16.962
Sit in the chair,
wait for my call.

29:17.021 --> 29:18.864
I can't.
May, you sit down and shut up.

29:18.923 --> 29:20.800
I can't let you do this
when it was me!

29:24.262 --> 29:28.301
I did it. God help me.
I killed him.

29:37.308 --> 29:39.345
I had to sleep with Curtis.

29:40.245 --> 29:42.122
I was afraid to say no.

29:42.213 --> 29:44.989
Afraid? He physically
threatened you?

29:47.619 --> 29:48.654
No.

29:49.187 --> 29:51.997
I was afraid that he'd
drop me as a client.

29:53.391 --> 29:56.929
But Thursday night I told
Curtis that I loved my husband,

29:57.328 --> 29:58.966
that I was gonna
tell him the truth.

29:59.998 --> 30:01.841
And how did Curtis react?

30:01.900 --> 30:04.312
He told me not to.
He wanted me to stay.

30:04.502 --> 30:06.345
But I left.

30:08.239 --> 30:10.116
I told Zak everything.

30:10.408 --> 30:12.615
That I was gonna
end it with Curtis.

30:12.677 --> 30:14.350
And then I went back upstairs.

30:14.612 --> 30:16.888
Your husband let you go alone

30:16.948 --> 30:19.360
to confront a man
who coerced you?

30:20.185 --> 30:22.529
Zak wanted to
show Curtis a lesson.

30:22.587 --> 30:25.898
But I said no.
I had to be the one.

30:26.558 --> 30:29.095
So I could walk away
with my dignity.

30:29.360 --> 30:31.897
And when you told Curtis
it was over?

30:34.199 --> 30:35.974
He tried to kiss me.

30:37.302 --> 30:40.772
He wouldn't listen,
so I hit him.

30:42.407 --> 30:43.613
Can you show me where?

30:50.615 --> 30:52.891
Once in the face like that.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.596
And that's it? You hit him
once and he went down?

30:57.822 --> 30:59.028
I think I hit him twice.

30:59.958 --> 31:01.835
Was that in the face again?

31:02.961 --> 31:06.773
No. The second one
was lower, here.

31:07.365 --> 31:08.901
He went down after two punches?

31:11.236 --> 31:13.682
I might have kicked him,
too, I don't remember.

31:14.272 --> 31:16.309
But you didn't mean
to kill him?

31:17.408 --> 31:18.785
Of course not.

31:19.677 --> 31:22.624
You wouldn't have kicked him very
hard, knowing how sick he was.

31:23.548 --> 31:26.154
Sick?
Curtis wasn't sick.

31:27.986 --> 31:29.431
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

31:30.755 --> 31:31.995
Wheeler? Word.

31:38.296 --> 31:39.502
You buy May's story?

31:39.564 --> 31:41.407
Mmm, could be
protecting her husband.

31:41.466 --> 31:43.412
He could be protecting her.

31:43.468 --> 31:47.382
Zak just came in, he says he needs
to get something off his chest.

31:47.438 --> 31:50.647
It was my fault. I thought
May would be safe.

31:51.542 --> 31:53.249
It's your fault that
Curtis slept with May?

31:53.444 --> 31:55.082
He forced himself on her.

31:55.146 --> 31:56.216
She told you that?

31:56.281 --> 31:57.760
He practically raped her.

31:57.815 --> 31:59.351
And then she gave him atrophy?

32:00.084 --> 32:02.155
Whatever May did,
she felt she had to.

32:04.889 --> 32:07.699
When I heard what Curtis
had done, I went nuts.

32:08.159 --> 32:10.070
So you decided
to teach him a lesson.

32:11.129 --> 32:14.235
Went upstairs, and I clocked
the guy in the face.

32:15.366 --> 32:18.210
I guess he must've
hit his head. Right?

32:20.705 --> 32:23.015
I hit him once
and he went down.

32:23.241 --> 32:27.018
I thought he'd get up,
but he just stayed down.

32:31.816 --> 32:34.353
I've had couples point their fingers
at each other lots of times.

32:34.419 --> 32:37.093
But fighting to take the blame?
That's new.

32:37.155 --> 32:38.429
Don't you believe in true love?

32:38.489 --> 32:42.232
You mean true confusion. He says
it's him, she says it's her.

32:42.327 --> 32:44.637
They each have
reasonable doubt.

32:45.096 --> 32:46.268
It's a good strategy.

32:46.331 --> 32:47.776
Strategy?

32:48.266 --> 32:51.008
One of 'em punched Curtis,
panicked when he went down,

32:51.069 --> 32:52.605
then they staged
a fake robbery.

32:52.670 --> 32:55.207
And then blamed the big scary
black man on the corner.

32:55.273 --> 32:56.946
Okay, we have to
keep it simple.

32:57.008 --> 33:00.546
We know that Zak would attack
Curtis to defend her honor.

33:00.878 --> 33:02.789
But what's May's motive?

33:03.181 --> 33:06.355
Well, maybe Curtis
went cold on her.

33:07.685 --> 33:09.824
Cut her off.
Ended her dream.

33:10.021 --> 33:11.523
Well, what did the ME say?

33:11.589 --> 33:13.296
Any blow to the
spleen would do it.

33:13.358 --> 33:15.838
He was that sick? And she
didn't know about it?

33:16.060 --> 33:18.199
She knew it.
Curtis told her.

33:18.396 --> 33:20.069
Guys use whatever
they have to get over.

33:20.498 --> 33:22.637
They have a tragic story,
a sickness.

33:23.034 --> 33:26.015
Even if they have a dead cat,
they'll work it into their rap.

33:26.871 --> 33:28.043
Heartwarming.

33:28.706 --> 33:30.811
But May did point
to my left side

33:30.875 --> 33:32.218
to show where she'd hit him.

33:32.276 --> 33:34.517
Because she knew it would make
her confession more believable.

33:34.879 --> 33:37.086
Zak didn't have a clue, he thought
he'd died from a head wound.

33:37.148 --> 33:38.593
Well, as long as
he's standing by her,

33:38.649 --> 33:40.492
I still have two
conflicting confessions.

33:42.153 --> 33:44.497
Let her go. And book
him for assault.

33:44.555 --> 33:47.968
Maybe a little taste of prison
life will weaken his bond to her.

33:49.260 --> 33:53.265
You need to get new evidence or
break up their marriage. For good.

33:53.331 --> 33:54.901
Otherwise we have no case.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

33:54.999 --> 33:56.034
Counselor...

33:56.300 --> 33:58.678
Wait, this is my sitter.
I'll be right back.

33:59.170 --> 34:00.342
Hello?

34:01.539 --> 34:05.510
Okay, well, Zak stood by May
through infidelity and murder?

34:05.977 --> 34:07.285
A few nights in jail
won't shake him.

34:08.513 --> 34:10.618
It's May whose loyalty
is shaky.

34:10.681 --> 34:13.422
She betrayed Zak once, she'd do
it again in a Nashville minute.

34:15.553 --> 34:17.692
So let's give her the chance.

34:18.889 --> 34:21.803
Seamus Flaherty wants
to meet with me? Why?

34:21.859 --> 34:24.931
Well, it turns out he
co-owned Curtis' studio.

34:25.496 --> 34:27.498
He says he wants to
give you back your tapes.

34:27.831 --> 34:28.867
You don't believe him.

34:28.933 --> 34:31.743
No, I don't. Seamus only
looks out for Seamus.

34:31.803 --> 34:33.304
My guess is he smells money.

34:33.938 --> 34:35.940
Money? But I don't have
any money at all.

34:36.007 --> 34:38.179
But this case is gonna
get a lot of exposure, May.

34:38.376 --> 34:42.085
Good kids from out of town
corrupted by the big, bad city.

34:42.580 --> 34:44.786
Your story is gonna be
worth a lot of money.

34:44.849 --> 34:46.054
Seamus wants a piece of it.

34:47.752 --> 34:49.629
Well, what about Zak,
should I tell him?

34:49.687 --> 34:51.496
I'm sure Zak
will want a piece, too.

34:51.556 --> 34:54.833
But may, you need to start
looking out for yourself.

35:00.198 --> 35:02.804
This'll always be
Curtis Gold Studios.

35:05.002 --> 35:06.447
May, I'm right outside
if you need anything.

35:10.541 --> 35:13.078
What, is she your den mother?
Where was I?

35:13.778 --> 35:15.416
The studio.
Right.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.492
Yeah, I'm never gonna
change the name, May.

35:21.252 --> 35:23.698
I'm gonna keep this place
in honor of Curtis.

35:23.988 --> 35:26.298
He was a good man.
He loved you.

35:26.924 --> 35:28.096
Just ignore the camera.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.505
The tape's only gonna be
seen by my investors.

35:32.163 --> 35:33.233
Investors?

35:33.898 --> 35:36.378
May, I mean, you know, you
got your 15 minutes of fame,

35:36.434 --> 35:38.573
but we're gonna need
a little help to turn that

35:38.636 --> 35:41.446
into, you know, 15 years
of rock and roll stardom.

35:42.273 --> 35:44.480
I'm sorry if this
question is rude.

35:44.542 --> 35:45.714
Shoot.

35:46.711 --> 35:48.384
Do you know anything
about music?

35:48.446 --> 35:49.891
I mean, you own a bar.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.354
(CHUCKLES)

35:51.516 --> 35:54.520
I knew that babe in the woods
routine was just an act.

35:54.585 --> 35:57.031
You wanna talk business?
Okay, May.

35:57.722 --> 36:00.066
I got the money
and the connections

36:00.124 --> 36:03.105
to make all your dreams
come true.

36:03.561 --> 36:05.040
Look at that.

36:05.796 --> 36:07.366
I told you everything
that happened that night.

36:07.431 --> 36:08.910
I don't know how much
more I can show you.

36:08.966 --> 36:11.947
Humor me. I'm a visual learner.
Uncuff him.

36:12.870 --> 36:15.510
My partner's in the booth
downloading tape files.

36:15.573 --> 36:17.246
Evidence. You shouldn't
be watchin' that.

36:17.308 --> 36:19.083
Can you leave it on?

36:19.410 --> 36:20.548
MAY: What is this?

36:20.611 --> 36:23.114
SEAMUS: It's your
ticket to stardom.

36:23.381 --> 36:26.726
I Was a Devil's Darling?
That's the name of my show?

36:27.084 --> 36:31.191
Limited engagement, my club.
Industry professionals only.

36:31.622 --> 36:34.899
I'm even gonna get you a career
architect to create the show.

36:34.959 --> 36:36.165
You know what that is?

36:36.227 --> 36:37.262
No.

36:37.662 --> 36:40.643
It's this guy, he writes the
songs, he constructs your image.

36:41.065 --> 36:43.375
Best in the business,
a real star-maker.

36:43.434 --> 36:46.779
I showed him your video, he liked
the video, but he loves your story.

36:47.838 --> 36:50.284
But that video isn't anything
like me and my story...

36:50.341 --> 36:53.515
I Was a Devil's Darling.
I Was a Devil's Darling.

36:54.712 --> 36:57.283
That's your story, that's your
image, that's your ticket. Okay?

36:58.950 --> 37:02.796
You shared a bed with the devil
and you lived to tell the tale.

37:04.622 --> 37:06.966
You want me to say that
my husband is the devil?

37:07.391 --> 37:09.564
Well, he did kill a guy, right?

37:09.627 --> 37:10.833
That's not what happened.

37:11.195 --> 37:14.005
Okay, you know,
you got a little of that,

37:14.065 --> 37:15.544
victim who falls
for the abuser thing.

37:15.800 --> 37:18.747
Which I personally
find very sexy.

37:18.803 --> 37:20.578
I'm gonna push that.

37:22.340 --> 37:24.081
Zak didn't abuse me.

37:24.141 --> 37:26.212
Well, he didn't really treat
you very well, now, did he?

37:29.614 --> 37:31.651
"Death ls An Aphrodisiac"?

37:31.716 --> 37:32.786
I don't even know
what that means.

37:32.850 --> 37:35.831
Well, it's Greek. It means,
you know, sexual turn-on?

37:37.088 --> 37:38.192
I need to think about this.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.668
No. No. Thinking is
not an option, okay?

37:41.058 --> 37:44.631
We gotta get this in place so we open
the show just when you take the stand.

37:45.563 --> 37:47.099
Take the stand?

37:47.565 --> 37:50.637
Your husband killed Curtis Gold.
He admitted it.

37:50.935 --> 37:53.142
<i>It's</i> a <i>tragedy, but you gotta
put yourself in front of it</i>

37:53.204 --> 37:55.878
Hey, don't torture yourself.

38:00.144 --> 38:03.057
All you gotta do
is verify his account.

38:03.381 --> 38:05.019
It wasn't his fault.

38:05.082 --> 38:06.322
Whatever.

38:07.018 --> 38:10.261
I am prepared to offer you

38:12.323 --> 38:13.529
this...

38:15.192 --> 38:17.001
this amount of money,

38:17.361 --> 38:20.240
today to cement
our partnership.

38:23.534 --> 38:24.740
That's a lot of money.

38:25.336 --> 38:27.247
<i>May, you cannot do it</i>

38:27.305 --> 38:30.309
with an open murder investigation
hangin' over your head.

38:30.374 --> 38:32.012
Your husband
beat Curtis to a pulp.

38:32.543 --> 38:34.420
That's not what happened,
he only hit him twice.

38:34.478 --> 38:37.015
Twice. Yes.
Yeah, he's an animal.

38:37.081 --> 38:38.583
And he doesn't deserve
to be on the streets.

38:38.649 --> 38:40.890
That's not what happened, he...

38:42.887 --> 38:44.127
Curtis was sick...

38:44.188 --> 38:45.997
May. Let it go.

38:46.057 --> 38:47.832
He had a bad spleen.

38:49.226 --> 38:51.763
I was gonna take him
to the hospital.

38:52.963 --> 38:55.534
My husband didn't know!
I did.

39:00.638 --> 39:03.141
He can't be here,
his wife's inside.

39:03.674 --> 39:05.483
You said it was taped.

39:08.279 --> 39:09.758
You set me up!

39:09.880 --> 39:10.984
Zak, no!

39:11.048 --> 39:12.186
Fellows, we're in
a meeting here.

39:12.249 --> 39:14.695
Meeting's over, Flaherty,
let's go.

39:14.785 --> 39:17.857
He was sick!
I heard the whole thing, May!

39:17.922 --> 39:20.232
You told me to kick him in the
side, you made me kill him.

39:20.291 --> 39:21.497
No. Zak,
you don't understand.

39:21.559 --> 39:24.335
I saw you, May. You wanted
to be a star so bad

39:24.395 --> 39:26.375
you were... You were
gonna take his money.

39:26.764 --> 39:29.040
I wanted the money
for the lawyer, Zak.

39:29.100 --> 39:30.636
Everything I did,
I did for you!

39:30.968 --> 39:33.414
You broke our marriage vows
for me?

39:33.838 --> 39:35.181
What do you think?

39:35.239 --> 39:37.685
Curtis Gold was gonna work with
me just based on my talent?

39:37.742 --> 39:40.689
Curtis said you're gonna be
a star, everybody says so!

39:40.878 --> 39:43.791
Who? My father?
Our friends back home?

39:44.215 --> 39:46.786
Curtis was interested in me and my
voice at first, but later on...

39:47.918 --> 39:49.727
I had to sleep with him.

39:49.787 --> 39:52.358
We spent all our money moving
here, chasing your stupid dream!

39:52.423 --> 39:53.766
Our dream.

39:54.825 --> 39:56.065
Your dream.

39:56.861 --> 39:59.705
And I was too much
of a coward to tell you.

40:00.164 --> 40:02.940
Your eyes shining with
pride, loving me so much.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.606
Bragging to
all our friends back home!

40:06.370 --> 40:08.111
I slept with Curtis,
the only other man

40:08.172 --> 40:10.083
I've ever slept with
other than you.

40:10.141 --> 40:12.052
And I did it
because I love you.

40:13.878 --> 40:15.755
You loved him so much
you set him up for murder?

40:15.813 --> 40:16.814
It wasn't like that!

40:16.881 --> 40:19.259
You had him kill Curtis, then
you were gonna blame Goro.

40:19.316 --> 40:22.593
Goro was a killer! He was gonna
end up in jail someday anyway!

40:22.653 --> 40:25.361
Why, May? Why'd you
make me kill him?

40:25.890 --> 40:27.892
I just wanted to throw a
punch, get it out of my system

40:27.958 --> 40:29.562
is all I needed.

40:31.729 --> 40:35.108
If Curtis was still alive,
my sin would hang over us.

40:35.366 --> 40:38.540
But if he was dead, it'd be
like nothing ever happened.

40:38.736 --> 40:40.647
We would be pure again.

40:41.472 --> 40:43.577
I was trying to save us,
don't you see that?

40:45.543 --> 40:46.817
Okay, Zak, let's go.

40:47.278 --> 40:49.383
I love you, Zak, please
say you love me! Please!

40:51.282 --> 40:53.694
Zak. Zak,
we'll go home,

40:53.751 --> 40:56.391
we'll forget we ever came
to New York City, please.

40:56.454 --> 40:58.400
We're not like Goro,
we're good people.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.436
We just wanna go home.
Please.

41:00.491 --> 41:02.368
We just wanna go home!

41:04.595 --> 41:06.233
We misjudged her.

41:06.530 --> 41:09.704
She put love for Zak first
every step of the way.

41:10.768 --> 41:13.977
"I loved my husband so much
I had to kill my lover."

41:14.038 --> 41:15.915
Make a good country song.

41:15.973 --> 41:18.886
It's a shame Curtis is
too dead to record it.
