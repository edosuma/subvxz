What's the matter?

14:30.120 --> 14:31.633
Oh, you need someone
in this business.

14:31.720 --> 14:32.709
It's too tough.

14:34.480 --> 14:35.469
Where's your loved one?

14:36.440 --> 14:39.637
Lying, promising, fucking up.

14:41.280 --> 14:42.395
I'm all alone, okay?

14:43.480 --> 14:44.629
Believe it or not, I'm happy.

15:23.440 --> 15:26.318
Hey, Robbie.
What happened at the morgue?

15:26.880 --> 15:28.472
He started the autopsy and...

15:28.560 --> 15:30.073
No, no, no, I mean with Hilmarson.

15:31.280 --> 15:32.269
Nothing.

15:33.480 --> 15:34.469
I get it differently.

15:35.920 --> 15:38.229
I think I'm probably
better off working on my own.

15:38.640 --> 15:39.789
No, you're not.

15:41.640 --> 15:42.629
What's wrong with her?

15:43.360 --> 15:45.157
She's got ideas about me.

15:45.240 --> 15:47.071
She's a fan or something.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.596
(LAUGHING) Well, give her a week,
you'll cure her of that.

15:50.240 --> 15:51.992
Bev, could you get
Constable Hilmarson in here?

15:52.080 --> 15:53.069
Yep.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.833
You know, no one else
will team up with you two.

15:55.840 --> 15:58.912
You're the leftovers.
So, you know, just get on with it.

16:00.600 --> 16:01.589
Constable.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.877
Detective Senior Constable Griffin.

16:04.480 --> 16:05.674
Don't let her go anywhere without you.

16:06.720 --> 16:07.709
Pretty basic stuff.

16:09.040 --> 16:10.359
There's been a complication.

16:12.040 --> 16:13.029
She was pregnant.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.672
The pathologist delivered the baby
when I was there.

16:16.440 --> 16:17.555
Seventeen weeks, he thought.

16:18.560 --> 16:19.549
Jesus.

16:22.200 --> 16:23.872
Excuse me, sorry.

16:28.360 --> 16:31.238
Everything's going to forensics.
ISPR and DAO.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.509
Okay. Can you check
on your buddy, yeah?

16:39.640 --> 16:41.995
It's driving me out
of my freaking mind

16:42.080 --> 16:43.638
I can't sleep at night.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.159
I'm gonna have to call you back.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.950
Yeah, okay. Thank you, bye.

16:52.520 --> 16:53.509
Everything okay?

16:55.160 --> 16:57.549
Yeah, I'm feeling a bit fragile, um...

17:00.400 --> 17:02.118
It's hor... It's hormones.

17:03.720 --> 17:04.709
What kind of hormones?

17:07.120 --> 17:08.109
Baby hormones.

17:09.320 --> 17:10.435
I'm pregnant.

17:11.720 --> 17:14.757
Eighteen weeks, the same as the
victim's, and it caught me off-guard.

17:16.680 --> 17:17.669
Yeah, okay.

17:19.560 --> 17:20.629
You'll want to give that up.

17:21.680 --> 17:22.795
What?

17:25.240 --> 17:26.798
Oh, yeah, yes.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.911
Anyway, the homicide
detectives are here.

17:30.520 --> 17:31.669
Okay, I'll be right up.

17:38.520 --> 17:39.509
Hi.

17:39.720 --> 17:41.995
So, there's a bit of a theory
that Carson and l have been discussing.

17:42.240 --> 17:43.229
Mmm-hmm?

17:43.480 --> 17:45.630
We think the women want
their man to be a calm point

17:46.400 --> 17:48.868
so they can spin out
emotionally and go chaotic.

17:49.280 --> 17:50.269
That's right.

17:50.360 --> 17:51.793
And when they circle back in,

17:52.160 --> 17:53.752
they want to see
their man cry.

17:53.880 --> 17:55.518
-Can you turn the screen on?
-Mmm-hmm.

17:57.760 --> 18:00.513
Ironically, we think that's when
the men actually go underground

18:00.720 --> 18:01.709
and they get cunning.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.310
You know, porn, affairs, prostitutes.

18:04.760 --> 18:06.876
Interesting theory,
is that what happened to you?

18:07.760 --> 18:08.829
No, I haven't cried in seven years.

18:09.560 --> 18:10.675
Sarge.

18:12.160 --> 18:13.752
-Boss.
-Hi.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.510
So, Robin, you lead off
and tell us where we are.

18:16.800 --> 18:17.789
Yes.

18:18.480 --> 18:19.833
We're calling this a murder case.

18:19.920 --> 18:22.639
Because circumstances indicate
that's a high probability.

18:22.920 --> 18:24.399
There's also the death of the foetus.

18:24.560 --> 18:25.595
That's not murder.

18:25.680 --> 18:28.752
I mean it should be, but no,
the baby has to be born.

18:29.080 --> 18:30.638
A person in pain.

18:30.800 --> 18:33.598
We have a serious problem
with identification.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.159
The face is very damaged,

18:35.280 --> 18:37.874
even beyond computer
reconstruction imaging.

18:38.760 --> 18:41.957
And nobody's registered a missing Asian
female in the last 10 days.

18:42.440 --> 18:44.795
We went beyond that to 30 days,
still nothing.

18:44.880 --> 18:46.791
So not likely to be
an Asian-Australian then.

18:47.080 --> 18:48.069
What about the DNA?

18:48.240 --> 18:52.233
DNA and fingerprints have been taken
and run against our files. No match.

18:52.520 --> 18:53.953
Immigration came up with nothing,

18:54.080 --> 18:57.072
which means that either she's Australian
or she's come in under a false passport.

18:57.080 --> 18:58.433
which means that either she's Australian
or she's come in under a false passport.

18:59.040 --> 19:01.508
-CARSON: We check the suitcase?
-What for, a travel tag?

19:01.880 --> 19:02.869
They can be that stupid.

19:03.600 --> 19:06.558
My guess, Asian student,
working in the sex industry.

19:06.920 --> 19:10.276
It's a loophole. They finance their
studies by working in brothels,

19:10.680 --> 19:12.033
ministering to creeps.

19:12.160 --> 19:13.149
Hey, steady on.

19:13.600 --> 19:16.068
-2%, maybe.
-Yeah, well, that's 2000, boss.

19:16.160 --> 19:18.833
I mean, you go to these
colleges, there's no one there.

19:19.320 --> 19:20.799
They never intended to go to school.

19:21.640 --> 19:23.437
Yes, it's a high likelihood.

19:24.280 --> 19:26.510
But what we have here
is a crime of passion.

19:27.480 --> 19:29.152
She's from a poor family in Thailand,

19:29.240 --> 19:32.073
doesn't know anyone
and can't speak the language,

19:32.560 --> 19:34.869
hoping to make some money
to send back to her family.

19:35.160 --> 19:37.913
She probably arrived at
a brothel subsidy with a big debt.

19:38.320 --> 19:41.312
She's had unprotected sex
and got herself pregnant.

19:42.040 --> 19:45.032
Some kind of crazy relationship
with a customer or a pimp.

19:45.040 --> 19:46.268
Some kind of crazy relationship
with a customer or a pimp.

19:47.800 --> 19:49.631
Of course, the facts give us
a lot less than that.

19:49.840 --> 19:50.955
Yeah, nothing.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.111
No, not nothing.

19:53.760 --> 19:54.749
We have the foetus.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.231
A paternal link can be established.

19:57.840 --> 19:59.558
It's never been done but technically,

19:59.960 --> 20:02.190
if we're holding the father's DNA
on our system,

20:02.720 --> 20:03.755
we've got a lead.

22:13.200 --> 22:14.758
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

(WHISTLES)

22:18.400 --> 22:19.389
What can I get you?

22:19.480 --> 22:21.755
Can I just get a glass of water
with some lemon in it, please?

22:21.840 --> 22:23.159
I'll grab a cappuccino, thanks.

22:23.240 --> 22:25.515
Can I just get a water without lemon?

22:25.840 --> 22:27.512
Yeah, just waters
for everyone, thanks.

22:28.200 --> 22:29.235
-Okay, all right.
-Cheers.

22:32.520 --> 22:34.795
She keeps coming up to you,
it has to be a sign.

22:34.960 --> 22:36.552
It's like a neon sign.

22:36.720 --> 22:38.836
(SCOFFS) She's over here
'cause she's a waitress.

22:38.920 --> 22:40.797
She gets paid to come visit us, right?

22:41.320 --> 22:42.389
If you really want to hit on her,

22:42.480 --> 22:45.472
what you gotta do,
is you go over to her.

22:46.040 --> 22:48.554
Oh, how would,
how would that look?

22:49.600 --> 22:50.589
-You want to see?
-Yeah.

22:51.640 --> 22:52.629
Hmm.

22:57.520 --> 23:00.273

23:01.440 --> 23:04.750
The continuing inventions
of the fuck wizard.

23:05.120 --> 23:06.712
-She's smiling.
-Is it "get away from me" smiling?

23:06.960 --> 23:08.029
Or is it smiling...

23:08.120 --> 23:10.190
I think it's smiling
like "I'm being polite."

23:10.720 --> 23:11.835
Here he comes.

23:11.960 --> 23:13.871
And the conqueror returns.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.719
-Pickles, boys.
-Small tub of gherkins.

23:17.840 --> 23:19.068
What happened?

23:19.600 --> 23:20.749
She likes Vietnamese food.

23:21.080 --> 23:23.992
-Oh.
-So you didn't ask her out?

23:24.280 --> 23:26.236
No, I mean, I gave her a bit
of masculine bravado

23:26.320 --> 23:27.992
and she's kind of still
thinking about it.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.071
That's... So you just bought
some pickles.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.668
No, what I did was transcended
the friend zone, mate.

23:32.800 --> 23:35.189
No coins, just talk about adult stuff.

23:35.280 --> 23:36.952

23:37.080 --> 23:39.116
"Ooh, this guy's giving me attention.

23:39.280 --> 23:41.794
"I can feel the pheromones
burning, real hot stuff."

23:41.920 --> 23:42.909
Your problem is, Neeson,

23:43.000 --> 23:44.956
that you actually can't ask
a real girl out, can you?

23:45.040 --> 23:46.234
-Oh.
-W hat?

23:46.680 --> 23:48.511
Your problem is
you're a little bore girl.

23:48.800 --> 23:50.233
You bore chicks to death, right?

23:50.320 --> 23:52.311
Probably like that chick
found dead at Bondi.

23:52.480 --> 23:54.550
-One of your bore victims, mate.
-Which one?

23:54.800 --> 23:56.916
-Death by boredom.
-What are you talking about?

23:57.080 --> 23:58.718
-Don't you watch the news?
-What are you saying now?

23:58.800 --> 24:00.711
Come on, get it up.
It's been everywhere.

been booking her?

24:09.640 --> 24:10.629
We tried to, but...

24:10.920 --> 24:12.319
You gave her such a great rating.

24:12.400 --> 24:13.549
-Yeah.

43:27.720 --> 43:30.871
Julia fell in love with
the French teacher at her school.

43:32.240 --> 43:33.798
Was he married, too?

43:33.880 --> 43:37.270
"He" is actually a "she"
and yeah, yeah, she was married, too.

43:38.840 --> 43:41.400
Mary is angry on my behalf.

43:41.480 --> 43:44.358
She attacked Julia over the whole...

43:44.440 --> 43:46.112
Lesbian aspect.

43:56.080 --> 43:58.719
Five years old and...

43:58.800 --> 44:01.234
I think she's about eight.

44:01.320 --> 44:04.312
And this... This was her first pony.
Sovereign.

44:04.320 --> 44:05.673
And this... This was her first pony.
Sovereign.

44:05.760 --> 44:08.752
The, uh, the saddle went underneath
his stomach, she broke her arm.

44:08.760 --> 44:09.829
The, uh, the saddle went underneath
his stomach, she broke her arm.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.991
We wanted you to know the situation.

44:18.880 --> 44:21.110
Last week we met her boyfriend.

44:21.200 --> 44:24.112
He's 42. She's 17.

44:28.160 --> 44:31.072
How old was she when you brought her
home for the first time?

44:32.920 --> 44:34.035
She was two days old.

44:36.720 --> 44:37.709
Two days.

44:41.400 --> 44:42.879
That was the last time I saw her.

44:47.280 --> 44:48.269
lwas 16.

44:55.920 --> 44:57.558
I don't...

44:57.640 --> 44:58.959
I don't think I can help.

44:59.920 --> 45:01.751
I'm not her mother.

45:01.840 --> 45:04.798
Ijust gave birth to her. That's all.

45:05.960 --> 45:08.110
Personally, I think
she needs to meet you.

-Thanks.

45:49.560 --> 45:50.913
It's nice of you.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.150
Hey, listen, I hope you don't mind...

45:53.240 --> 45:54.514
I asked your friend to dinner.

45:55.280 --> 45:56.554
Oh.

45:56.640 --> 45:58.631
She's not a friend, but okay.

45:58.720 --> 45:59.835
We work together.

46:04.160 --> 46:07.152
So, Miranda, take it you're
in the law enforcement trade, too?

So, Miranda, take it you're

46:09.240 --> 46:11.515
Yeah. Oh, have you got an ashtray?

-I am giving these up.

46:16.800 --> 46:18.472

you're not cooking green chicken curry?

So, um, what do you do when
you're not cooking green chicken curry?

46:28.160 --> 46:30.435
I do energy work.

46:30.520 --> 46:33.432
I do massage, I do Chinese massage.

46:33.520 --> 46:36.956
I basically open people up.

46:37.040 --> 46:39.031
You know, to new levels
within themselves.

46:39.120 --> 46:40.189
Okay.

46:41.280 --> 46:44.113
I like the odd massage, but you know,

46:44.200 --> 46:46.555
most people not too much.

46:46.640 --> 46:48.517
(LAUGHS)

If you want to give it a try,
it will only take a few minutes.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.150
Just about being shown the door, really.
Here, try this.

46:59.160 --> 47:00.673
-Hmm.
-lt's good. Yeah.

47:01.200 --> 47:02.474
Once that's done,

47:02.560 --> 47:03.595
you can...

47:04.400 --> 47:06.072
Step through anytime you like.

47:07.840 --> 47:09.398

Can you watch the chook, Rob?

47:15.000 --> 47:16.274
Sure.

47:16.360 --> 47:17.634

It's locked and bolted.

I don't have a pocket,
but I'm a leopard.

47:49.120 --> 47:50.599
Right.

-No, I...

No, I mean, it was
an adolescent fantasy. I was 12.

gonna ride over the hilltop

a wild life amongst the gypsies.

52:32.720 --> 52:35.314
but, you know, she's a new lesbian

52:35.400 --> 52:39.188
and sort of political
so it's bonding for her and Isadore

52:39.280 --> 52:42.875
to be outraged together. Especially
about finishing your education.

52:42.960 --> 52:45.952

but differently.

He's tender and he's caring.

52:56.720 --> 52:59.473
And he lives an actual life
in a real world.

52:59.560 --> 53:02.552
And he has ideals, you know, something
that my parents strenuously avoid.

that my parents strenuously avoid.

53:06.120 --> 53:08.793

because I'm feeling edgy.

53:11.400 --> 53:14.039
thank you for having me and,

you know, thank you
for not aborting me.

It's okay.

53:45.600 --> 53:47.511
I mean, it's not okay for you.

53:47.600 --> 53:49.556
But it is okay for me.

there wasn't one perpetrator.

believe it, but I have Asian friends

55:45.240 --> 55:46.832

to teach them to swim.

-Hi.

Hi.

56:34.920 --> 56:38.515
Yes, we had a little bit
of a problem with the sample.

56:38.600 --> 56:40.670
Couldn't get a true result.

56:40.760 --> 56:41.988
How do you mean?

56:42.080 --> 56:44.594
Well, foetus' DNA
wasn't matching China Girl's.

56:45.440 --> 56:47.192
-Really?
-RAY: Really.

56:47.280 --> 56:50.272
I suspected contamination so I took
another sample, sent it off to two labs.

56:54.840 --> 56:57.752
I mean, I don't know. (SIGHS)

56:57.840 --> 57:00.832

for the first time.

57:25.800 --> 57:28.837
She's completely precious.
Look at that.

57:28.920 --> 57:31.070
She didn't grow up with me.

57:31.160 --> 57:34.357
Ah, well...

57:34.440 --> 57:37.034
(SIGHS) There's your wound, Robbie.

57:38.920 --> 57:40.558
I don't know.

57:40.640 --> 57:42.710
I don't feel anything.

57:42.800 --> 57:45.997
No, no. Well, you wouldn't.
