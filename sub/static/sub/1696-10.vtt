00:12.262 --> 00:13.957
And trust.

00:14.030 --> 00:16.328
All right, very nice, people.

00:16.399 --> 00:19.665
Now that you have clearly
mastered the trust exercise,

00:19.737 --> 00:22.797
you, you're ready to act.

00:22.873 --> 00:27.537
But the secret to acting is reacting.

00:29.513 --> 00:31.505
Did you see that? He reacted.

00:31.583 --> 00:34.245
- He didn't think. Did you?
- I try not to, sir.

00:34.319 --> 00:36.344
And you're great at it.

00:36.421 --> 00:39.219
I want you all living in that mom...

00:40.792 --> 00:41.884
I've got a brother.

00:41.960 --> 00:43.985
You're gonna have to do
way better than that.

00:44.062 --> 00:46.031
Oh. Hmm...

00:47.366 --> 00:50.096
Nice work. You get an A for the day.

00:50.169 --> 00:52.501
I'll take a B if you stop doing that.

00:52.572 --> 00:54.335
Everybody listen up.

00:54.407 --> 00:59.573
Now we're going to do
the mirror exercise.

00:59.646 --> 01:03.082
What one does, the other mirrors.

01:04.617 --> 01:07.781
Acting, reacting.

01:09.891 --> 01:11.290
Mirror.

01:12.894 --> 01:17.058
Now, next week, we are doing scenes
from Shakespeare's great play,

01:17.131 --> 01:19.190
<i>Romeo and Juliet. </i>

01:19.267 --> 01:25.400
"But soft, what light
through yonder window breaks?

01:25.474 --> 01:32.141
"It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. "

01:32.214 --> 01:36.117
Man, that dude
knew how to pick up chicks.

01:36.186 --> 01:40.987
- So, who do you want for a partner?
- Well, not Oliver. I mean, look at him.

01:43.393 --> 01:44.985
I know, he's always monkeying around.

01:45.061 --> 01:48.793
- Exactly, and I need a good grade.
- So do I.

01:48.866 --> 01:51.733
But if one of us doesn't pick him,
nobody will.

01:51.802 --> 01:53.463
I guess you're right. So...

01:53.537 --> 01:56.062
- You pick him.
- Me? No way!

01:56.140 --> 01:57.573
Nice mirror.

01:59.543 --> 02:01.603
I have a compromise.

02:01.680 --> 02:03.671
I pick Henry!

02:03.749 --> 02:07.014
No fair! He went to Shakespeare Camp
three summers in a row!

02:07.085 --> 02:09.781
- Why do you think I picked him?
- You know what? I don't care.

02:09.854 --> 02:11.447
This doesn't mean I pick Oliver.

02:11.523 --> 02:14.220
You pick Oliver? Bold choice!

02:14.294 --> 02:16.728
Especially considering
you're going to have to kiss him.

02:17.864 --> 02:20.924
I knew I'd get you! Just kidding!

02:30.144 --> 02:31.577
<i> Come on!</i>

02:31.645 --> 02:35.638
<i>You get the limo out front</i>

02:35.716 --> 02:39.551
<i>Hottest styles, every shoe, every color</i>

02:39.621 --> 02:42.920
<i>Yeah, when you're famous</i>
<i>it can be kind of fun</i>

02:42.991 --> 02:48.088
<i>It's really you</i>
<i>but no one ever discovers</i>

02:48.163 --> 02:51.428
<i>Who would have thought</i>
<i>that a girl like me</i>

02:51.499 --> 02:56.733
<i>Would double as a superstar?</i>

02:56.806 --> 03:00.799
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

03:00.876 --> 03:02.776
<i>Chill it out, take it slow</i>

03:02.845 --> 03:04.472
<i>Then you rock out the show</i>

03:04.548 --> 03:08.985
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

03:09.052 --> 03:10.542
<i>Mix it all together</i>

03:10.620 --> 03:13.783
<i>And you know that</i>
<i>it's the best of both worlds</i>

03:19.664 --> 03:20.995
Oh, Juliet.

03:23.701 --> 03:27.296
Oliver, we have been rehearsing
for over two hours

03:27.372 --> 03:29.135
and we're still on the first page!

03:29.207 --> 03:32.871
It didn't take Shakespeare
this long to write the play!

03:32.945 --> 03:35.880
Okay, just give me a second
to get into character.

03:35.948 --> 03:37.779
Why me?

03:37.850 --> 03:39.613
Hey, Juliet!

03:41.387 --> 03:43.413
Get it? I'm a fruit fly!

03:43.490 --> 03:46.050
Huh, fruit fly?

03:46.126 --> 03:48.390
Now you're a dead fruit fly.

03:48.461 --> 03:50.656
Can we just please do this,
Oliver, please?

03:50.730 --> 03:52.994
Okay. I'll really try this time.

03:54.367 --> 03:58.998
But soft, what light over yonder
breaks wind?

03:59.073 --> 04:01.633
No! You know what,
I'm just gonna email Mr. Corelli

04:01.709 --> 04:03.108
and ask for another partner.

04:03.177 --> 04:06.476
Miley, wait. I'm just nervous, okay?

04:06.547 --> 04:10.245
- Nervous? About what?
- Messing up and looking stupid.

04:10.318 --> 04:12.650
Hey, guess what, done that.

04:12.721 --> 04:14.018
At least when I joke around,

04:14.089 --> 04:16.079
they're laughing
because I want them to.

04:16.158 --> 04:18.649
Come on, Oliver,
nobody's gonna laugh at you.

04:18.726 --> 04:21.322
Trust me, this has been
going on forever.

04:25.034 --> 04:32.671
Four score and...

04:34.845 --> 04:38.042
I'm a fruit fly! Abraham fruit fly!

04:39.950 --> 04:43.147
Okay, look, Oliver,
everybody gets nervous.

04:43.220 --> 04:45.586
When I'm up there as
Hannah Montana, I get nervous, too.

04:45.656 --> 04:47.818
- Oh, yeah, right.
- No, really.

04:47.892 --> 04:52.192
The minute I hear I have to perform,
I get a huge knot in my stomach

04:52.263 --> 04:55.596
and my heart starts pounding
so hard I can hardly move.

04:55.667 --> 04:57.794
Guess who's singing
the National Anthem

04:57.869 --> 04:59.599
at the Laker game tomorrow night?

04:59.672 --> 05:03.108
Yes! Hannah Montana!
Rocking the anthem! For the Lakers!

05:03.175 --> 05:07.305
But I'm very nervous, huge knot,
don't know if I can do it.

05:07.379 --> 05:10.246
- Nice try.
- Okay, so I don't get nervous.

05:10.316 --> 05:12.114
I'm Hannah Montana,
for crying out loud!

05:12.185 --> 05:13.743
I'm not a normal kid!

05:13.820 --> 05:18.154
Wow. <i>Romeo and Juliet. </i>
I had to do this scene in speech class.

05:18.225 --> 05:20.785
- And you did just fine, didn't you?
- Nope.

05:20.861 --> 05:24.422
Actually, it was
the darkest day of my life.

05:24.498 --> 05:25.966
Made it through the first two words

05:26.033 --> 05:30.697
then froze up like Aunt Pearl
in the outhouse on Christmas morning.

05:30.771 --> 05:35.799
- But everything turned out okay?
- Only 'cause I started cracking jokes.

05:35.877 --> 05:39.143
"What light through yonder window
breaks wind?"

05:39.214 --> 05:40.909
That one killed them!

05:43.018 --> 05:44.178
But that was wrong.

05:44.253 --> 05:48.019
Shakespeare is very important
and you'll use it every day of your life.

05:48.090 --> 05:50.616
Like fractions.
I'm using them right now.

05:50.693 --> 05:55.562
I'm halfway out the room.
Three-quarters and I'm gone.

05:55.632 --> 05:58.100
See? I'm not the only one
who has a problem with Shakespeare.

05:58.168 --> 05:59.999
Even your dad got all freaked out.

06:00.069 --> 06:02.765
Oliver, but he didn't have me.
You're my friend.

06:02.839 --> 06:04.865
And I'm not gonna let you
fall on your face.

06:04.942 --> 06:07.843
Here, let's do the trust exercise, go!

06:13.117 --> 06:15.608
Okay, technically,
that wasn't your face.

06:21.793 --> 06:24.023
- Hey, Rico. How's it going?
- Great, fine, swell.

06:24.095 --> 06:27.223
Now give me my box.
Where's my secret candy box?

06:29.902 --> 06:33.736
Where is it? What happened?
What did you do? It's gone!

06:34.907 --> 06:38.104
Yeah, along with the enamel
on your teeth.

06:38.177 --> 06:40.543
Look, your dad called.
Your last dental exam was so bad,

06:40.613 --> 06:44.209
they're putting your x-rays
up in the lobby to scare the other kids.

06:44.284 --> 06:46.752
The man lies!
Last time we went to the movies,

06:46.820 --> 06:50.517
he put me in a diaper
so I could get in for free.

06:50.591 --> 06:51.751
I'm not buying it.

06:51.825 --> 06:53.759
This is the same father
who gave me 100 bucks

06:53.827 --> 06:56.353
to keep this away from you.

06:56.431 --> 06:58.592
Give me, give me, give me,
give me, give me, give me...

06:58.666 --> 07:00.429
Please, settle down, all right?

07:00.501 --> 07:05.234
You see what this candy is doing
to you? This is for your own good.

07:05.306 --> 07:07.798
Fine. But listen to me and listen good.

07:07.876 --> 07:10.674
There's not one place on this earth
where you could put that candy

07:10.746 --> 07:12.839
that I'm not gonna get it.

07:12.915 --> 07:14.940
Oh, yeah? Well, what about right here?

07:15.017 --> 07:16.644
Give me, give me, give me,
no, give me, give me.

07:16.719 --> 07:21.215
- And here.
- Give me, give me, give me...

07:25.195 --> 07:27.663
Hey, Dad, how you doing?
What's for dinner? Hope it's meatloaf.

07:27.731 --> 07:29.961
How was your day? Mine was good.
Nice shirt, goes with your hair.

07:30.033 --> 07:33.595
What's for dinner?
Did I already ask that? Meatloaf?

07:33.671 --> 07:36.196
Jackson, how much candy
have you had today?

07:36.274 --> 07:38.970
Why would you even ask that?

07:40.044 --> 07:43.013
We both know you have a problem
when you've had too much sweets.

07:43.080 --> 07:44.570
Let it go. I was eight, it was Easter,

07:44.649 --> 07:47.244
I'd never seen
a chocolate bunny before.

07:47.319 --> 07:50.686
Big chocolate bunny ears
with candy eyes. Whoa!

07:52.124 --> 07:54.149
Okay, let me smell your breath.

07:56.228 --> 07:59.596
Dang, you smell
like the inside of a piÃ±ata.

07:59.666 --> 08:03.261
Big deal.
So I had a few dozen pieces of candy.

08:03.336 --> 08:05.327
I can stop anytime I want.

08:07.440 --> 08:09.772
- Hey, what are you eating?
- Nothing! Get off my back, woman!

08:13.280 --> 08:16.909
Daddy, I haven't seen him like this
since Halloween of '99.

08:16.984 --> 08:21.250
Oh, I remember. I clocked him
at 58 miles an hour in his roller-skates.

08:21.322 --> 08:23.621
In a Yoda costume.

08:23.692 --> 08:24.989
So, how's it going with Romeo?

08:25.060 --> 08:28.120
Well, you know, I finally got Oliver
to take it seriously and guess what?

08:28.196 --> 08:30.721
He's seriously horrible.

08:30.799 --> 08:32.460
I just think
you guys need to take a break.

08:32.534 --> 08:33.761
We'll go to the Laker game,

08:33.835 --> 08:36.270
you'll sing the anthem,
get your mind off of it.

08:36.339 --> 08:37.397
I wish.

08:37.472 --> 08:40.669
But all I can think about is getting
a bad grade and looking stupid,

08:40.743 --> 08:43.438
- just because I'm stuck with Oliver.
- Mile, Oliver is...

08:43.511 --> 08:46.504
I know, he's a friend
and you don't bail on friends.

08:46.582 --> 08:48.447
- Yeah, Mile, but...
- But nothing.

08:48.517 --> 08:49.712
It's like he's the <i>Titanic,</i>

08:49.786 --> 08:52.084
and I gotta jump ship
before I go down with him.

08:52.155 --> 08:54.851
Mile, iceberg right behind you.

08:56.460 --> 08:58.121
You said you'd be there for me.

08:58.195 --> 09:00.129
- Oliver, I was just...
- Bailing on me?

09:00.197 --> 09:02.598
No, I was just thinking
about bailing on you.

09:02.667 --> 09:05.158
- It's different!
- You said I was the <i>Titanic. </i>

09:05.236 --> 09:08.433
Not the ship!
The very successful movie!

09:09.874 --> 09:11.466
You made like $ 1 billion!

09:11.542 --> 09:14.535
Okay, Daddy,
we need a new warning signal.

09:14.613 --> 09:18.640
Honey, I did everything
but baste you with barbeque sauce.

09:18.717 --> 09:21.049
I should not feel bad about this.

09:21.120 --> 09:23.645
It's not my fault
that Shakespeare makes him nervous.

09:23.722 --> 09:26.691
"What light through yonder window
breaks?" How tough is that?

09:27.827 --> 09:29.795
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please rise</i>

09:29.863 --> 09:31.956
<i>for the singing of our National Anthem</i>

09:32.031 --> 09:35.330
<i>by teen pop sensation,</i>
<i>Hannah Montana. </i>

09:36.703 --> 09:41.038
<i> O say, can you see</i>

09:41.108 --> 09:45.374
<i>by the dawn's early light</i>

09:45.446 --> 09:49.314
<i>through yonder window breaks... </i>

09:54.456 --> 09:56.219
Or ramparts... No, rockets.

09:57.426 --> 10:00.486
Red glare... Oh, yeah, right.
Yeah, that's right.

10:04.966 --> 10:08.698
Look! I'm a cup fly! You get it?

10:19.383 --> 10:23.080
Jackson, you want some pancakes
with that syrup?

10:23.587 --> 10:25.384
No thanks. I'm good.

10:28.592 --> 10:32.620
Jumping Jehoshaphat, Son!
Next time, don't waste a plate.

10:32.697 --> 10:35.825
- Just drink it from the bottle.
- That's a great idea!

10:37.735 --> 10:38.997
Jackson!

10:41.406 --> 10:44.535
Whoo! That really worked.
Thanks, Dad!

10:44.610 --> 10:46.703
- Sweet.
- It's good.

10:49.548 --> 10:51.277
Hey, Mr. Stewart, how's Miley?

10:51.350 --> 10:55.548
Well, it's noon and she's still holed up
in her room, if that tells you anything.

10:55.621 --> 10:57.920
Hey, bud. How you doing?

10:57.991 --> 11:00.824
Okay. Except I had this awful dream

11:00.894 --> 11:04.295
where I forgot the National Anthem
in front of thousands of people.

11:05.599 --> 11:08.227
That wasn't a dream.

11:08.301 --> 11:11.169
You couldn't play along
for like a minute?

11:11.239 --> 11:14.072
Oh, sorry,
let's not think about it anymore.

11:14.141 --> 11:16.609
Let's watch some TV.
Get your mind off of it.

11:16.677 --> 11:19.771
<i>Everyone is talking about</i>
<i>Hannah Montana's massive mistake. </i>

11:19.847 --> 11:23.375
<i>Through yonder window breaks... </i>

11:33.662 --> 11:36.291
I am so sorry
you had to see that, Bearie.

11:38.034 --> 11:39.296
Bearie the bear?

11:39.369 --> 11:41.496
- You couldn't do better than that?
- I was three!

11:41.571 --> 11:46.008
And I'm not changing his name now,
that would just confuse him.

11:46.075 --> 11:48.135
- Here you go, Mile.
- I'm too upset to eat.

11:48.212 --> 11:50.203
I'm not.

11:50.281 --> 11:53.546
Well, listen, after tonight, when Hannah
performs on <i>Top Rockers,</i>

11:53.617 --> 11:56.677
nobody's even gonna remember
she screwed up the National Anthem.

11:56.754 --> 11:59.621
- What?
- <i>Top Rockers. </i> I love that show!

11:59.690 --> 12:01.682
Made the call this morning. It's all set.

12:01.760 --> 12:04.786
Daddy, I can't perform on <i>Top Rockers,</i>
that's a live show.

12:04.863 --> 12:06.160
What if I mess up again?

12:06.231 --> 12:09.291
Miley, what's going on?
You've never had stage fright before.

12:09.367 --> 12:13.134
These are very good.
What did you do to them?

12:13.205 --> 12:16.038
I mean, I have never had
people laughing at me before.

12:16.108 --> 12:17.871
Mile, that's not gonna happen again.

12:17.944 --> 12:22.176
Actually, I just put in just a splash
of vanilla and a hint of cinnamon.

12:22.248 --> 12:24.182
Daddy!

12:24.250 --> 12:26.776
Mile, listen,
if you wanna put this thing behind you,

12:26.853 --> 12:29.981
you gotta get back on the horse,
just like Uncle Earl.

12:30.057 --> 12:32.548
Uncle Earl forgot the words
to the National Anthem?

12:32.626 --> 12:34.526
No, Uncle Earl fell off a horse.

12:34.595 --> 12:37.996
Took four of us
to get that fat, old coot back up there.

12:38.065 --> 12:40.557
I just don't wanna get laughed at again.

12:40.635 --> 12:44.264
Wow. And that's exactly
how Oliver feels.

12:44.339 --> 12:47.740
And you bailed on him. Ironic, isn't it?

12:49.777 --> 12:52.770
Just stop your flapping
and eat your flapjacks.

12:54.316 --> 12:57.808
Mile, everybody gets nervous.

12:57.886 --> 13:00.116
But the longer you wait,
the tougher it's gonna get.

13:00.189 --> 13:03.647
I guess you're right.
I just gotta do this, don't I?

13:03.726 --> 13:06.594
But what if I forget the words
to one of my songs?

13:06.663 --> 13:10.622
Or I forget to put my costume on?
Then I'd be singing in my underwear.

13:11.768 --> 13:13.668
That'd be quite a show.

13:18.042 --> 13:20.408
Stupid selfish bees!

13:20.478 --> 13:22.343
How much honey do you need?

13:26.884 --> 13:28.044
Come on, Oliver.

13:28.119 --> 13:31.283
Miley really needs us there tonight.
You can't just bail on her.

13:31.356 --> 13:34.757
- Oh, you mean like she did to me?
- But she knows how you feel now.

13:34.826 --> 13:39.058
Leonardo DiCaprio
threw a foam finger at her.

13:39.131 --> 13:41.463
Hasn't she suffered enough?

13:41.533 --> 13:44.162
Let me think. No.

13:44.237 --> 13:45.534
Oliver!

13:46.072 --> 13:50.065
Oh, here we are
in Happy Bunnyland, Tokyo.

13:52.111 --> 13:53.772
Oh, no, what's that?

13:55.282 --> 13:59.116
It's Jack-zilla! Run for your bunny lives!

14:12.867 --> 14:15.461
What are you looking at?

14:15.537 --> 14:17.334
Jackson, you have to stop.

14:17.405 --> 14:19.464
You're hopping down
a bunny trail of no return.

14:19.541 --> 14:21.476
You don't know
what you're talking about.

14:21.544 --> 14:25.207
Of course I do. I was like you once.
But I'm a veggie man now.

14:28.517 --> 14:29.950
I even worked out this morning.

14:30.019 --> 14:33.615
It's like I have the energy
of a 5-year-old again.

14:33.690 --> 14:36.124
Great. Tell it to someone who cares.

14:36.193 --> 14:40.027
When you're ready to get that
candy monkey off your back, call me.

14:42.733 --> 14:46.169
Well, I don't need any help, all right?
I'm perfectly fine.

14:48.206 --> 14:50.265
Here you go, sweetie.
Here's your... Oh, dear!

14:50.341 --> 14:54.334
Oh, don't pick that up, honey, it's filthy.
We'll get another one.

15:10.429 --> 15:12.330
What's happening to me?

15:24.945 --> 15:28.108
Hey, Jackson.
Beautiful day for a walk, isn't it?

15:31.218 --> 15:32.412
Ladies.

15:33.053 --> 15:36.318
With some pretty ladies
to go on a walk with.

15:36.390 --> 15:39.224
Hey, guys, wait up, I'll come with you.

15:39.294 --> 15:40.454
See, girls?

15:40.529 --> 15:42.759
That's what too much sugar
will do to you.

15:44.099 --> 15:45.726
Guys, wait up!

15:46.935 --> 15:49.233
They make these chairs smaller?

15:51.007 --> 15:54.966
You're a speedy little guy, aren't you?
Come on, guys.

16:05.756 --> 16:07.121
Help me.

16:09.993 --> 16:11.824
Help me, help me.

16:15.934 --> 16:21.463
I can see my feet again.
My skinny, skinny, little feet.

16:21.539 --> 16:24.406
That's it. That is it!

16:24.475 --> 16:28.104
You don't own me anymore,
old devil sugar!

16:31.250 --> 16:33.445
I love you.

16:33.519 --> 16:35.180
No! No!

16:40.793 --> 16:43.285
Now, bud, you've done this
a million times.

16:43.363 --> 16:45.228
You got nothing to be nervous about.

16:45.298 --> 16:47.766
Then why am I sweating
through my wig?

16:47.834 --> 16:48.994
You're gonna do fine.

16:49.069 --> 16:52.061
I got all the confidence
in the world in you.

16:54.242 --> 16:56.210
Okay, just remember,
if her mouth is open

16:56.277 --> 16:58.677
and nothing's coming out,
you cut to commercial.

16:58.746 --> 17:00.441
No worries, honey.

17:01.282 --> 17:02.943
And I mean pronto.

17:05.319 --> 17:07.982
Lola, I can't remember anything.
What am I gonna do?

17:08.056 --> 17:10.286
Don't worry, I got your back.

17:10.358 --> 17:12.589
Oh, cue cards. Great idea.

17:12.661 --> 17:15.721
- What if I forget how to read?
- Get a grip.

17:15.797 --> 17:20.258
This is the life, hold on tight.
This is the dream, it's all you need.

17:20.336 --> 17:22.702
Hey, you're right.
You know, that's great advice.

17:22.771 --> 17:26.138
What advice?
Those are the lyrics to your song.

17:26.209 --> 17:28.609
Of course they are!
I'm not nervous. I'm good.

17:28.678 --> 17:30.543
- Places, Miss Montana.
- Help me!

17:30.613 --> 17:33.947
I will.
Just remember, keep your eyes on me.

17:34.018 --> 17:36.509
Right. What song is that from?

17:36.587 --> 17:39.283
That's not a song, that was the advice!

17:39.356 --> 17:40.789
Oh, boy.

17:42.893 --> 17:46.193
Oh, great, what's Oliver doing here?

17:46.264 --> 17:49.461
- Maybe he came to support a friend.
- Or maybe he came to laugh at me.

17:49.534 --> 17:51.627
Could be. Either way, good luck.

17:53.071 --> 17:55.505
Four, three, two...

17:55.573 --> 17:59.408
<i>And now, live and acoustic,</i>
Top Rockers <i>is proud to present!</i>

17:59.478 --> 18:02.276
<i>Give it up for Hannah Montana!</i>

18:14.561 --> 18:17.189
<i>Take the world, shake and stir</i>

18:17.264 --> 18:21.564
<i>And that's what I got going on</i>

18:21.635 --> 18:24.104
<i>I throw my cares up in the air</i>

18:24.172 --> 18:27.630
<i>And I don't think they're coming down</i>

18:27.709 --> 18:35.041
<i>Yeah, I love how it feels right now</i>

18:35.116 --> 18:42.253
<i>Still loving how it feels right now</i>

18:42.324 --> 18:44.519
Down in front!

18:59.442 --> 19:02.810
<i>You never know where you'll... </i>

19:02.880 --> 19:06.646
<i>And I'm gonna take my... </i>

19:06.717 --> 19:09.652
<i>I'm still getting it wrong</i>

19:15.160 --> 19:19.426
<i>Hold on tight</i>

19:19.498 --> 19:26.267
<i>And this is the dream,</i>
<i>it's all I need</i>

19:26.338 --> 19:33.643
<i>You'll never know where you'll find it</i>
<i>And I'm gonna take my time, yeah</i>

19:33.713 --> 19:40.517
<i>I'm still getting it right, this is the life</i>

19:43.290 --> 19:45.258
And you were worried.

19:45.325 --> 19:49.785
<i>A whole new scene</i>
<i>and I'm swimming with a new crowd</i>

19:49.863 --> 19:52.697
<i>I'm breaking down the old four walls</i>

19:52.767 --> 19:56.225
<i>And I'm building them up</i>
<i>from the ground</i>

19:56.304 --> 20:00.604
<i>Yeah, I love how it feels right now</i>

20:05.648 --> 20:08.981
<i> Who said, who said</i>
<i>I won't be Superman?</i>

20:09.051 --> 20:12.418
<i>I say, I say that I know I can</i>

20:12.488 --> 20:15.889
<i>Who said, who said</i>
<i>I can't be President?</i>

20:15.958 --> 20:20.055
<i>I say, I say you ain't seen nothing yet</i>

20:22.232 --> 20:23.961
<i>Who said?</i>

20:34.078 --> 20:35.773
<i>Thank you, all. </i>

20:35.847 --> 20:39.806
<i>You know, I had a rough patch</i>
<i>at the beginning of the show</i>

20:39.884 --> 20:42.876
<i>and an even rougher patch</i>
<i>earlier this week. </i>

20:42.954 --> 20:46.015
<i>But I learned something</i>
<i>that I should've known all along. </i>

20:46.091 --> 20:49.060
<i>Good friends don't bail on you. </i>

20:49.128 --> 20:51.494
<i>And they're always there</i>
<i>to catch you if you fall. </i>

20:51.563 --> 20:54.532
We love you, Hannah!
- <i>I love you, too!</i>

20:54.600 --> 20:57.968
<i>I love you all!</i>
<i>Thank you everybody. Good night. </i>

20:58.037 --> 21:00.062
I love you, Jackson.

21:05.912 --> 21:10.111
That's right. I'm talking to you, big boy.

21:12.119 --> 21:15.751
You're not real.

21:20.194 --> 21:23.790
Can I have a bite of that, big boy?

21:33.275 --> 21:34.504
I don't think I can do this.

21:34.577 --> 21:36.841
Come on, Oliver,
you just gotta stay positive.

21:36.913 --> 21:38.676
Okay.

21:38.748 --> 21:42.809
- I'm positive I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

21:42.885 --> 21:45.911
You were there for me
and I'm gonna be there for you.

21:48.025 --> 21:50.289
I love the energy I've seen today,
I love the passion.

21:50.360 --> 21:53.557
But most of all
I love that we're almost done.

21:53.630 --> 21:57.259
Stewart, Oken, take us home, please.

21:58.635 --> 22:02.037
Okay, remember,
all you have to do is die. Go.

22:05.410 --> 22:07.401
Oh, Romeo.

22:07.478 --> 22:10.345
Poison, I see,
hath been his timeless end.

22:10.415 --> 22:12.280
Oh, Romeo.

22:12.350 --> 22:14.945
And now I die.

22:29.069 --> 22:31.765
I see the light.

22:31.838 --> 22:35.831
Again, longer than it took him
to write the play.
