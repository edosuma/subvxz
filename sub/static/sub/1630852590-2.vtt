There is no explanation.

14:39.813 --> 14:41.896
(door creaks open)

15:46.763 --> 15:48.463
and who might you be?

15:57.207 --> 16:01.209
(indistinct chatter)

16:01.328 --> 16:04.862
(phones chiming,
devices beeping)

16:04.948 --> 16:05.780
jess: Harper?

16:06.399 --> 16:07.448
Harper?

16:08.618 --> 16:09.784
Earth to harper.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.704
Folks on table three
need help. Go.

16:13.757 --> 16:15.089
And smile.

16:23.800 --> 16:26.601
Good afternoon.
May I be of some assistance?

16:26.736 --> 16:30.038
Yes, please. Can I have
a double-decaf, no-foam latte?

16:30.140 --> 16:33.975
And I'll do a skinny,
half-caf, white mocha, no whip.

16:34.878 --> 16:37.428
So that was a double scoop--

16:37.480 --> 16:38.596
uh, I mean, a-- a skinny?

16:38.648 --> 16:41.366
No. No, no.
A double-decaf, no-foam latte.

16:41.451 --> 16:42.817
Mine is the skinny.

16:42.952 --> 16:45.119
Yeah, uh, she'll
get right on it.
Excuse us, guys.

16:48.658 --> 16:51.108
Did you say anything?
To mrs. Dunn? To anyone?

16:51.211 --> 16:52.827
Did you tell them
who you really are?

16:53.329 --> 16:55.463
-No.
-Okay. Okay, good.
That's good.

16:56.449 --> 17:00.301
Everyone here
is so frantic and busy.

17:00.837 --> 17:02.086
Yeah. It's 2020,

17:02.172 --> 17:04.005
the age
of "frantic and busy."

17:04.140 --> 17:06.808
uh, sorry.
I'm just so confused.

17:06.926 --> 17:09.310
Okay. It-- it's like
in your little brother's book.

17:09.462 --> 17:10.961
You traveled through time.

17:11.064 --> 17:12.146
And that bunker
in the basement,

17:12.265 --> 17:13.648
it's a portal,
a door to the past.

17:13.767 --> 17:15.733
I mean, for you,
I guess it's a door
to the future, but...

17:16.319 --> 17:18.186
You talk too fast too.

17:18.321 --> 17:20.938
Oh, I'm sorry.
I do that
when I get excited.

17:21.991 --> 17:24.308
-The girl who looks like me--
-harper.

17:24.411 --> 17:27.829
She's my great-granddaughter?
That's just impossible.

17:27.947 --> 17:30.198
Trust me,
it's-- it's possible.

17:30.316 --> 17:31.699
Trust you? How can I?

17:31.835 --> 17:33.334
I don't even know
your name--

17:33.453 --> 17:34.919
it's griffin.
Griffin campbell.

17:36.923 --> 17:38.956
-Oh, my...
-Daisy, what is it?

17:39.042 --> 17:40.842
I-- I don't feel
so well.

17:42.128 --> 17:43.211
Harper?

17:43.329 --> 17:45.263
Oh, whoops!
You caught us.

17:45.348 --> 17:47.849
We were just practicing
our dance moves.

17:47.967 --> 17:49.550
Harper's studying the 1930s

17:49.686 --> 17:52.186
and, uh, there's
a school dance coming up.

17:52.305 --> 17:53.337
There is?

17:53.440 --> 17:54.806
Yes.

17:54.891 --> 17:56.357
Yup, it's right around
the corner.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.176
Well, come on, girl.
Kirstin's here.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.028
So I can get you back
to do your homework.

18:01.147 --> 18:03.231
Yeah. About that.
Um...

18:03.366 --> 18:05.733
-About what?
-Griffin: Her homework.

18:05.869 --> 18:08.069
Uh, she has this test
to study for.

18:08.187 --> 18:09.454
It's, uh... History.

18:10.824 --> 18:12.373
Yes, history.

18:12.959 --> 18:15.243
Griffin: It's all a part
of that 1930s thing.

18:16.195 --> 18:18.379
You know, I said
I'd help with the,
uh, the dance moves

18:18.498 --> 18:20.214
and the flashcards
and all that.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.834
So, uh, can she
come over tonight?

18:23.920 --> 18:25.887
You know,
she's always over there.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.756
Griffin, why don't you
come home with us? Hm?

18:28.875 --> 18:30.391
Last I heard,
flashcards work anywhere.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.093
We'll call your mom
from the car.

18:33.229 --> 18:34.645
Yeah, okay. Okay.

18:36.933 --> 18:38.266
Don't worry, I got this.

18:39.552 --> 18:40.485
Got what?

18:42.605 --> 18:45.406
Of course, dad hides it
in the scariest place
possible.

18:46.109 --> 18:47.224
Should've
looked here first.

18:47.277 --> 18:48.609
(lights fizzling)

18:49.195 --> 18:50.411
it does that sometimes.

18:50.530 --> 18:52.029
We think it might be
in the wiring.

18:52.115 --> 18:53.281
Or the mirror.

18:54.417 --> 18:56.450
So how are we gonna
find the ghost?

18:57.370 --> 18:58.870
I don't see
anyone in there.

18:58.955 --> 19:00.588
What if we try
talking to it again?

19:01.124 --> 19:02.957
Good idea!
Do you want me to?

19:03.075 --> 19:04.425
I'll do it.

19:07.096 --> 19:08.963
What do you think
I should ask?

19:09.883 --> 19:13.434
Try...
"if you're not savannah,
who are you?"

19:13.553 --> 19:17.438
only like this...
"whooo are yooooou?"

19:17.557 --> 19:19.223
okay, got it.

19:20.092 --> 19:24.812
So if you're not savannah,
whoooooo--

19:24.931 --> 19:26.113
sarah:
Are you kids down there?

19:26.265 --> 19:28.566
If you are,
you know you're
not supposed to be.

19:29.435 --> 19:30.985
-Busted.
-Totally.

19:31.103 --> 19:33.454
Be right up!
You stay, topher.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.239
See if you can get it
to write something.

19:43.499 --> 19:47.802
Hi. I'm topher, by the way.
And you are?

19:49.389 --> 19:52.723
Maybe instead I should ask,
who were you?

19:54.344 --> 19:57.979
Okay. You don't like "who."
let's try "why."

19:58.765 --> 20:02.934
why are you haunting this place,
these kids, this family?

20:05.805 --> 20:09.073
Give me a letter.
Two letters, initials.

20:09.809 --> 20:10.775
I'll take anything.

20:13.563 --> 20:14.695
Whoa!

20:31.831 --> 20:34.765
(tense music playing)

20:42.558 --> 20:45.559
(door creaking)

20:51.150 --> 20:52.783
no way!

20:59.242 --> 21:00.458
Jess:<i> Topher!</i>

21:00.543 --> 21:01.993
He was told
to come straight home.

21:02.078 --> 21:03.911
Topher! Get down here!

21:04.047 --> 21:06.196
Uh, harper,
can you run upstairs
and get your brother?

21:06.249 --> 21:07.798
Ten to one, he's streaming
some horror opus

21:07.884 --> 21:09.300
instead of doing
his homework.

21:09.385 --> 21:10.501
Yes, ma'am.

21:11.587 --> 21:12.420
Ma'am?

21:13.205 --> 21:14.555
Uh, mother?

21:16.208 --> 21:18.392
Mom is fine.
Always has been.

21:27.904 --> 21:29.937
Griffin, what is going on
around here?

21:30.523 --> 21:31.656
Oh, like I said,

21:31.741 --> 21:33.691
it's a part
of her history class.

21:33.776 --> 21:36.610
Harper's taking
this full immersion thing
very seriously.

21:37.447 --> 21:38.913
Jumping in with
both lace-up boots.

21:39.065 --> 21:40.748
(sighs)
nothing for dinner.

21:41.451 --> 21:42.950
You know,
if you wouldn't mind,

21:43.069 --> 21:44.902
can you tell harper and topher
I had to run to the market?

21:45.004 --> 21:46.370
Oh, uh,
tacos are good for you?

21:46.456 --> 21:47.872
Great!
I love tacos.

21:47.957 --> 21:50.291
Of course,
they probably didn't have
tacos in the 1930s,

21:50.409 --> 21:52.293
but I'm sure harper
will gobble 'em right up.

21:54.180 --> 21:55.179
Yeah.

22:15.618 --> 22:16.784
She's an artist too.

22:17.870 --> 22:19.120
Is that supposed to be
her father?

22:20.239 --> 22:21.322
Griffin:
I guess so.

22:22.492 --> 22:23.908
He died
when she was younger.

22:25.795 --> 22:26.911
Like my mother died.

22:27.947 --> 22:30.247
-Grace?
-Yes.

22:31.334 --> 22:32.416
Grace.

22:33.336 --> 22:34.635
I suppose
harper misses her father

22:34.754 --> 22:36.137
as much as
I miss my mother.

22:38.290 --> 22:40.808
Look, harper's mom
just ran to the market.

22:40.927 --> 22:43.677
This is the perfect
opportunity to get you
back to 1930.

22:43.796 --> 22:45.646
But we have to leave
right now.

22:45.765 --> 22:46.847
Come on.

22:46.966 --> 22:48.099
Leave, okay.
