CATHERINE:
<i>Nine years ago,</i>

00:02.555 --> 00:04.971
I witnessed my mother's murder.

00:05.010 --> 00:08.279
I would have been killed, too,
<i>if it hadn't been for Vincent.</i>

00:09.464 --> 00:11.215
You're him.

00:11.217 --> 00:12.883
<i>The things you've done...</i>

00:12.885 --> 00:15.403
VINCENT:
<i>I hate myself for them.</i>

00:15.405 --> 00:19.156
I'm trying to decide
if I belong in a cage.

00:19.158 --> 00:23.160
I just found...
six cases of you

00:23.162 --> 00:25.396
trying to save victims
around the city.

00:25.398 --> 00:27.564
<i>You're not a monster.</i>

00:27.566 --> 00:30.734
<i>You know, that first night</i>
<i>we met in the woods,</i>

00:30.736 --> 00:32.253
<i>I knew...</i>

00:32.255 --> 00:34.905
that you would never hurt me.

00:34.907 --> 00:36.674
Vincent, I want
to have you over for dinner.

00:36.676 --> 00:39.176
<i>And unless there's something</i>
<i>else holding you back,</i>

00:39.178 --> 00:41.078
<i>I hope to see you there.</i>

01:00.282 --> 01:03.117
(steady heartbeat)

01:03.119 --> 01:05.936
(distorted, echoing):
Vincent?

01:05.938 --> 01:07.905
What are you doing?

01:07.907 --> 01:10.040
(object clatters to ground)
Uh...

01:10.042 --> 01:11.742
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to startle you.

01:11.744 --> 01:13.244
Uh, it's okay, I...

01:13.246 --> 01:18.532
forgot to turn the
security system on again.

01:18.534 --> 01:21.051
What's going on?
Nothing. I... (clears throat)

01:21.053 --> 01:23.454
I just wanted to make
sure that, um...

01:23.456 --> 01:25.789
Is everything okay?

01:25.791 --> 01:29.143
Uh, yeah, I just...
wasn't feeling so great.

01:29.145 --> 01:33.964
So is... that why you didn't
show up for dinner last night?

01:33.966 --> 01:35.983
Uh, yeah.

01:35.985 --> 01:40.187
Because I kind of thought
that you stood me up.

01:40.189 --> 01:44.859
No, I just, uh, should've told
you that I wasn't gonna make it.

01:46.862 --> 01:50.647
Okay, look, I, um...

01:50.649 --> 01:53.284
I found the present you
left me on the windowsill,

01:53.286 --> 01:54.585
which...

01:54.587 --> 01:57.037
was so sweet.

01:57.039 --> 01:59.039
Thank you.
And I realized

01:59.041 --> 02:01.926
that you must have left it
during my birthday party,

02:01.928 --> 02:05.029
which involved many margaritas,

02:05.031 --> 02:06.847
and, uh,
I wondered if, maybe,

02:06.849 --> 02:09.383
when you left it,
you saw me and...

02:09.384 --> 02:11.519
You don't have to give me
an explanation.

02:11.521 --> 02:13.637
So you did see it?

02:13.639 --> 02:17.191
Because... Vincent,
it was just a stupid,

02:17.193 --> 02:19.193
drunken...
You can kiss whoever you want.

02:19.195 --> 02:22.530
No... uh, yeah, I know that.

02:22.532 --> 02:25.165
I mean, it's not like we're...
No.

02:25.167 --> 02:28.619
(laughs)
No, it's not. So...

02:29.654 --> 02:33.073
I'm really sorry
about dinner.

02:33.075 --> 02:35.075
No. It's no big deal.

02:35.077 --> 02:37.912
I just wanted to make sure
that you're okay.

02:37.914 --> 02:40.030
(quietly):
Yeah.

02:40.032 --> 02:41.665

Okay.

(Catherine sighs)

03:59.194 --> 04:01.495
Okay, okay, fine.

04:01.497 --> 04:03.280
I knew it; I knew
there was a guy.

04:03.282 --> 04:05.382
"Was" being the operative word.

04:05.384 --> 04:07.784
Apparently, I got myself
into yet another

04:07.786 --> 04:10.921
complicated non-relationship
that I think is going somewhere,

04:10.923 --> 04:13.340
only to discover
it is going nowhere.

04:13.342 --> 04:15.459
Okay, well, first of all,
if he's not into you,

04:15.461 --> 04:17.428
he's an idiot,
and second-- who is he?

04:17.430 --> 04:18.978
Doesn't matter.

04:18.981 --> 04:21.598
From now on, I am
sticking to simple.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.517
Simple, like your dad
marrying someone young enough

04:23.519 --> 04:25.769
to be your sister?

04:26.688 --> 04:29.406
Oh, God. Dress fitting.

04:29.408 --> 04:31.909
Brooke forgot to take your shoes
when she left this morning.

04:31.911 --> 04:34.478
She says she'll meet you
at the bridal salon at 1:00.

04:34.480 --> 04:37.247
Okay, I meant to call, but since
Heather's away in Atlantic City,

04:37.249 --> 04:38.648
I thought we
could reschedule.

04:38.650 --> 04:40.584
You know, dresses are
much more her thing.

04:40.586 --> 04:42.819
Catherine, I wish you'd
just give Brooke a chance.

04:42.821 --> 04:44.204
I have.

04:44.206 --> 04:45.956
You haven't spent
more than ten minutes

04:45.958 --> 04:48.208
in the same room with her
since the engagement party.

04:48.210 --> 04:50.110
(sighs)

04:50.112 --> 04:52.513
Great. So I'll see you
at dinner tonight.

04:52.515 --> 04:55.215
(sighs, groans)
The reservation's for four,

04:55.217 --> 04:57.801
so if you can't bear the
thought of being trapped alone

04:57.803 --> 04:59.242
with just the two of us,
invite someone.

04:59.267 --> 04:59.888
Mm.

04:59.889 --> 05:02.056
Like that nice man from
the engagement party.

05:02.058 --> 05:03.357
Brooke really
hit it off with him.

05:03.359 --> 05:05.392
Evan?
You talking about me?

05:05.394 --> 05:07.528
Mr. Chandler.
Good to see you.

05:07.530 --> 05:10.948
How would you like to save Cat
and come to dinner tonight?

05:10.950 --> 05:12.533
Dad.
No. It would

05:12.535 --> 05:14.201
be my pleasure.
What time?

05:14.203 --> 05:15.486
Hello. The person
that you are

05:15.488 --> 05:16.686
talking about is right here.

05:16.688 --> 05:18.872
7:30. At Per Se.
Still here.

05:18.874 --> 05:20.524
We'll be there.
Terrific.

05:22.711 --> 05:24.545
It means a lot to me.

05:24.547 --> 05:25.996
And to Brooke.

05:25.998 --> 05:28.865
All right, see you tonight.
Okay.

05:28.867 --> 05:32.419
Okay, before I enumerate
all of the ways that that was wrong,

05:32.421 --> 05:34.579
we should probably talk about
what happened the other night.

05:34.604 --> 05:35.340
Agreed.

05:35.341 --> 05:37.725
We got a dead body
down in SoHo.

05:37.727 --> 05:39.176
Looks like
we'll have to continue

05:39.178 --> 05:40.544
this conversation at dinner.

05:51.689 --> 05:54.608
I'm telling you, your dad
did you a huge favor.

05:54.610 --> 05:56.410
I am not having this
conversation right now.

05:56.412 --> 05:58.028
Things go south
with Mr. Complicated,

05:58.030 --> 06:00.781
he gets you a date with Evan.
It is not a date.

06:00.783 --> 06:02.833
Dinner at Per Se?
That's the definition of a date.

06:02.835 --> 06:05.085
You know what I'm thinking,
I'm thinking you're so hung up

06:05.087 --> 06:07.121
on the other guy
'cause he rejected you,

06:07.123 --> 06:08.533
and there's nothing more
tempting than rejection.

06:08.558 --> 06:09.424
That is ridiculous.

06:09.425 --> 06:11.358
That's Psych 101.
Besides, Evan's a cute guy

06:11.360 --> 06:13.177
and clearly
likes you.

06:13.179 --> 06:15.129
Okay.

06:15.131 --> 06:18.748
Nicholas Varkas, 26,
Queens address.

06:18.750 --> 06:21.702
Nicholas is an artist.
Any evidence of a break-in?

06:21.704 --> 06:24.254
No. No forced entry,
nothing missing.

06:24.256 --> 06:26.546
And the woman who found
the body said that there was

06:26.571 --> 06:27.942
some art opening tonight.

06:27.943 --> 06:30.611
It looks like they're
still having it.

06:30.613 --> 06:32.863
Well, if we let them,
they'd put a velvet rope

06:32.865 --> 06:34.615
around him and call it
an "installation""

06:34.617 --> 06:36.266
Are you Lauren Harris?

06:36.268 --> 06:39.153
Yeah. The other officers told me
I can keep working.

06:39.155 --> 06:41.655
We have 200 people
coming here in ten hours.

06:41.657 --> 06:42.956
The show must go on?

06:42.958 --> 06:43.957
He's not gonna cancel.

06:43.959 --> 06:45.125
"He" being...?

06:45.127 --> 06:46.827
Marco. The owner.
How many people

06:46.829 --> 06:49.046
have access to this gallery?
Usually,

06:49.048 --> 06:51.381
just me, Marco
and a few of the assistants,

06:51.383 --> 06:54.418
but Nicholas was here loading in
the final pieces last night.

06:54.420 --> 06:55.969
If that door
was left propped open,

06:55.971 --> 06:57.654
someone could've come in
from the alley.

06:57.656 --> 06:59.506
Can you think of anyone
who'd have a beef with him?

06:59.508 --> 07:01.124
I only met him a few times.

07:01.126 --> 07:03.227
EVAN:
Cat, Tess.

07:04.479 --> 07:06.563
EVAN:
Shot in the back.

07:06.565 --> 07:08.682
Two bullets,
low-caliber weapon.

07:08.684 --> 07:11.635
But the way he fell, he wasn't
running away from someone.

07:11.637 --> 07:13.403
So either someone
snuck up on him...

07:13.405 --> 07:16.273
Or whoever he was, he didn't
think they were a threat.

07:16.275 --> 07:18.075
I also found
some white cotton fibers.

07:18.077 --> 07:21.028
It's a long shot, but I could
run them back to the lab now.

07:21.030 --> 07:22.696
You two lovebirds go ahead.

07:22.698 --> 07:25.482
I'm gonna check out
the art in the bathroom.

07:25.484 --> 07:27.534
CATHERINE:
Okay, look, you don't have

07:27.536 --> 07:29.753
to come to dinner--
my dad put you on the spot.

07:29.755 --> 07:32.250
Not that it's a big deal
or anything, but the last

07:32.275 --> 07:33.694
thing I want to be doing
is having dinner

07:33.695 --> 07:35.739
with another murky,
undefined situation.

07:35.794 --> 07:37.211
This isn't murky, Cat.

07:37.213 --> 07:38.629
It's simple, okay?

07:38.631 --> 07:41.715
I'll pick you up at 7:00.

07:41.717 --> 07:45.302
Unless you don't think you can
handle yourself around me.

07:47.222 --> 07:48.689
Of course I can handle myself.

07:48.691 --> 07:50.674
It's just, after
the incident at my party...

07:50.676 --> 07:52.359
You mean when
you kissed me?

07:52.361 --> 07:55.362
You kissed <i>me.</i>
Your cheeks are turning red.

07:55.364 --> 07:57.030
(sighs)

07:57.032 --> 07:59.233
It's just, I don't want
to complicate things now.

07:59.235 --> 08:02.319
We're friends, we work together,
and I know what that's like,

08:02.321 --> 08:04.988
to think that someone
has feelings for you when...

08:04.990 --> 08:06.957
There are absolutely
no feelings.

08:06.959 --> 08:09.543
It was just one kiss.
Right.

08:09.545 --> 08:12.496
Just one, completely
meaningless...

08:12.498 --> 08:14.915
kiss.

08:17.218 --> 08:20.804
I'll pick you up at 7:00.

<i>about a girl.</i>

08:42.163 --> 08:44.296
He met her
at an art opening.

08:44.298 --> 08:46.548
She ended it
a couple of weeks ago.

08:46.550 --> 08:48.083
But it wasn't serious.

08:48.085 --> 08:49.718
I never met her.

08:49.720 --> 08:51.337
Did your son mention a name?

08:51.339 --> 08:52.471
Was there anyone

08:52.473 --> 08:53.922
he wasn't getting along with?

08:53.924 --> 08:56.225
He had a fight, um...

08:56.227 --> 08:59.395
on the phone...
two nights ago.

08:59.397 --> 09:01.430
About prices.

09:01.432 --> 09:03.232
Prices of
his paintings,

09:03.234 --> 09:05.434
I guess.

09:05.436 --> 09:07.486
He was yelling.

09:07.488 --> 09:09.571
It woke me up.

09:13.326 --> 09:16.695
11:15 p.m., Nicholas made a call
to the Marco Giconni Gallery.

09:16.697 --> 09:20.949
Our still conspicuously
absent gallery owner.

09:20.951 --> 09:23.151
Hmm.

09:23.153 --> 09:25.654
He may explain what I found
in Nicholas's bank account--

09:25.656 --> 09:27.673
not much.
I thought he'd be loaded--

09:27.675 --> 09:29.508
selling paintings
for five grand a pop.

09:29.510 --> 09:30.959
The standard gallery
commission's 50%,

09:30.961 --> 09:32.661
but Nicholas was
only making deposits

09:32.663 --> 09:34.480
for a couple hundred
here and there.

09:34.482 --> 09:36.265
If Marco was cheating Nicholas
out of his cut,

09:36.267 --> 09:38.217
maybe he went there
to confront him.

09:38.219 --> 09:40.168
(phone beeps)

09:40.170 --> 09:41.553
(groans):
Oh, its' my Dad.

09:41.555 --> 09:43.272
Checking in about
your big date?

09:43.274 --> 09:45.474
It is not a date.
Look, I know

09:45.476 --> 09:47.342
you're still holding out
for Complicated Guy,

09:47.344 --> 09:49.945
but you and Evan were both
blushing when I left.

09:49.947 --> 09:51.113
Okay, that's just because...

09:51.115 --> 09:52.948
(Catherine clears her throat)

09:52.950 --> 09:55.284
Okay.

09:56.286 --> 09:58.904
(whispers):
Okay.

09:58.906 --> 10:00.072
Yeah...

10:00.074 --> 10:01.657
he kissed me

10:01.659 --> 10:04.576
at my birthday party,
in the photo booth.

10:04.578 --> 10:05.794
What are we, strangers?

10:05.796 --> 10:07.162
How could you hold out
on me like that?

10:07.164 --> 10:08.747
It was not that big a deal.

10:10.834 --> 10:12.251
Okay, i-it's a mi...

10:12.253 --> 10:13.702
it's a minor big deal.

10:13.704 --> 10:15.954
Well, I'm confused.
Is it big or minor?

10:15.956 --> 10:17.389
(phone chimes)

10:17.391 --> 10:19.224
No, no, no, no.
Dinner's in five hours.

10:19.226 --> 10:20.259
Your dad can wait.

10:20.261 --> 10:21.810
It's not my dad.

10:21.812 --> 10:23.545
It is my soon-to-be step...

10:23.547 --> 10:26.148
thingy reminding me
of my dress fitting.

10:26.150 --> 10:27.399
This conversation's
not over.

10:27.401 --> 10:28.767
Oh, I'm glad you
feel that way,

10:28.769 --> 10:30.352
because you're
coming with me.

10:30.354 --> 10:32.721
And you're driving.
What?!

10:32.723 --> 10:35.607
Really? Because you don't
have to, I mean...

10:35.609 --> 10:37.225
Well, yeah, I'd love
to go for coffee.

10:37.227 --> 10:39.228
Ugh, I'm in desperate need
of caffeine,

10:39.230 --> 10:41.130
and I should probably
eat something

10:41.132 --> 10:43.532
that hasn't been microwaved
in a petri dish.

10:43.534 --> 10:47.086
The coffee at the campus diner
is guaranteed to kill

10:47.088 --> 10:50.139
any bacteria you may have
consumed with your lunch.

10:50.141 --> 10:51.540
(laughing)

10:51.542 --> 10:53.926
VINCENT: Hey, JT, I need
help with these

10:53.928 --> 10:55.310
numbers, man.

10:55.312 --> 10:56.712
Who's that?

10:56.714 --> 10:58.263
Uh, no one. I got to go.

10:58.265 --> 10:59.264
See you there?

10:59.266 --> 11:00.749
Okay, bye.

11:00.751 --> 11:02.768
Blood pressure is fine,
so please...

11:02.770 --> 11:04.937
please tell me why

11:04.939 --> 11:08.023
I can't remember
what happened last night.

11:08.025 --> 11:10.726
I don't know,
but for the third time,

11:10.728 --> 11:12.895
everything's normal.

11:12.897 --> 11:15.430
I woke up on the top
of Brooklyn Bridge.

11:15.432 --> 11:17.316
I'm not saying
that's not a problem.

11:17.318 --> 11:18.400
Come on, man.
(sighs)

11:18.402 --> 11:20.652
This has never happened before.

11:20.654 --> 11:22.070
Okay, let's trace it back.

11:22.072 --> 11:25.157
What were you doing
before your sleepwalk

11:25.159 --> 11:26.658
down non-memory lane?

11:26.660 --> 11:28.494
I was headed
to Catherine's and...

11:29.329 --> 11:30.779
What?

11:30.781 --> 11:31.914
What'd she
do now?

11:31.916 --> 11:33.949
Nothing.

11:33.951 --> 11:35.968
She must have
done something.

11:35.970 --> 11:39.505
Wait-- is this about her kissing
that guy the other night?

11:40.507 --> 11:42.391
You were thinking
about Catherine

11:42.393 --> 11:43.959
and some jerk in a lip-lock.

11:43.961 --> 11:46.895
Adrenaline kicks in,
your heart rate increases--

11:46.897 --> 11:48.514
long story short,

11:48.516 --> 11:51.850
you fugued-out
because you're jealous.

11:52.635 --> 11:54.436
"Fugued-out"?

11:54.438 --> 11:57.022
Fugue-- you're up
and walking around but...

11:57.024 --> 11:58.273
it's like you
got amnesia.

11:58.275 --> 11:59.525
Okay, wait.

11:59.527 --> 12:02.644
Jealousy cannot
cause memory loss.

12:02.646 --> 12:03.996
Besides...

12:03.998 --> 12:06.865
I don't have a right
to be jealous anyway.

12:06.867 --> 12:08.500
Free advice?

12:08.502 --> 12:11.787
Take a chance and tell her
how you feel.

12:11.789 --> 12:13.205
Okay, wait.

12:13.207 --> 12:15.507
Wait, wait, wait.
Who are you right now?

12:15.509 --> 12:17.759
Look, I know I've been
the president

12:17.761 --> 12:20.546
of the "Stay Away
from Catherine Club," but...

12:20.548 --> 12:22.681
she's only gonna wait
for you for so long

12:22.683 --> 12:24.816
before she moves on.

12:30.339 --> 12:31.990
(sighs quietly)

12:31.992 --> 12:34.643
♪

12:36.763 --> 12:40.482
♪ It'll be just
a matter of time ♪

12:40.484 --> 12:43.202
♪ Before you're crawling...

12:43.204 --> 12:45.320
(sighs)

12:45.322 --> 12:47.039
Okay. You ready?

12:47.041 --> 12:49.357
I can't wait to see it on you.
(teacup clinks)

13:00.136 --> 13:02.504
So, what do you think?

13:04.173 --> 13:05.173
It's nice.

13:05.175 --> 13:06.842
It's a lovely shape.

13:06.844 --> 13:08.977
And it will match
the flowers perfectly.

13:08.979 --> 13:11.063
Okay.

13:11.065 --> 13:14.516
It looks like a leprechaun
ate too many marshmallows.

13:14.518 --> 13:15.984
(laughing)

13:15.986 --> 13:17.152
Yes.

13:19.322 --> 13:21.073
Yes, it does.

13:21.075 --> 13:23.692
Okay, all the men coming to
your wedding should thank you.

13:23.694 --> 13:25.611
Speaking of...

13:25.613 --> 13:28.413
your dad said you're bringing
a date to dinner tonight?

13:28.415 --> 13:29.781
Oh, Evan? No, he's just
that friend

13:29.783 --> 13:31.416
that I brought
to your engagement party.

13:31.418 --> 13:33.835
Oh, yeah, that friend
that you just kiss sometimes.

13:33.837 --> 13:35.704
He kisses a lot of people.

13:35.706 --> 13:37.456
So did your dad.

13:37.458 --> 13:40.092
Wow, I really don't need to hear
the rest of that paragraph.

13:40.094 --> 13:42.210
Well, I'm just saying
when the right person

13:42.212 --> 13:44.046
comes into your life,
people can change.

13:44.048 --> 13:46.515
Let's just say
that serial dating

13:46.517 --> 13:48.300
isn't my only issue.

13:48.302 --> 13:50.385
(sighs)
Look...

13:50.387 --> 13:52.187
I'm half your dad's age.

13:52.189 --> 13:53.939
My parents
think I'm crazy.

13:53.941 --> 13:55.641
His friends think
I'm a gold digger.

13:55.643 --> 13:56.992
He has two

13:56.994 --> 13:58.760
very opinionated daughters,

13:58.762 --> 14:00.979
one of whom
is warming up to me

14:00.981 --> 14:03.282
like it's the Ice Age.

14:03.284 --> 14:06.068
On the surface
there are all these obstacles.

14:07.487 --> 14:10.072
But for the right guy,
it's worth ignoring them.

14:12.825 --> 14:14.876
(phone chimes)

14:14.878 --> 14:16.411
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:16.413 --> 14:18.380
I have to go.

14:19.165 --> 14:20.382
We'll try again later,

14:20.384 --> 14:21.717
Lucky Charms.

14:23.753 --> 14:26.138
You know, she's not so bad.

14:26.140 --> 14:28.123
I think you might need
to replace the "thingy"

14:28.125 --> 14:29.457
in "step-thingy."

14:30.343 --> 14:32.678
She left her sunglasses.

14:59.528 --> 15:02.363
You ran your
stepmom-to-be's plates?

15:02.365 --> 15:05.082
And her driver's license
and her name.

15:05.084 --> 15:07.335
Turns out she's married.
What?!

15:07.337 --> 15:09.370
I think that's the guy
who was kissing her--

15:09.372 --> 15:11.172
her husband of three years.

15:11.174 --> 15:12.373
And your dad doesn't know?

15:12.375 --> 15:13.674
He rented the Fallwyck Hotel

15:13.676 --> 15:16.294
for their wedding
six weeks from now.

15:16.296 --> 15:18.463
What do you think?

15:21.433 --> 15:24.168
Nicholas didn't
just do abstract art.

15:24.170 --> 15:25.970
He also did nudes.

15:25.972 --> 15:27.972
Yeah, don't they all.

15:27.974 --> 15:30.174
Hey, look at these.

15:33.845 --> 15:36.731
Why would you paint
the same thing over and over?

15:36.733 --> 15:38.866
To get better at it?

15:38.868 --> 15:41.285
Or sell it
more than once.

15:44.389 --> 15:48.042
There's a bunch
of duplicates here.

15:48.044 --> 15:50.711
<i>Untitled Number Three,</i>
<i>Untitled Number Three...</i>

15:50.713 --> 15:52.482
Maybe we're looking
at some kind of art fraud.

15:52.483 --> 15:54.121
Collectors think
they're getting a one of-a-kind,

15:54.122 --> 15:55.722
but Marco's
selling multiple copies

15:56.019 --> 15:57.418
of the same painting.

15:57.420 --> 15:59.754
We got to meet this Marco.
Mm.

16:04.843 --> 16:06.394
Get this.

16:06.396 --> 16:08.479
A month ago, Nicholas
sold three of his paintings

16:08.481 --> 16:10.665
to a gallery across town
for a couple hundred bucks.

16:10.667 --> 16:12.400
But Marco sells them
for thousands.

16:12.402 --> 16:13.935
Why the premium rate?

16:16.605 --> 16:18.773
Hey, check this out.

16:20.442 --> 16:22.076
List of clients?

16:22.078 --> 16:23.444
Maybe Nicholas threatened
to tell Marco's clients

16:23.446 --> 16:25.179
that they were being swindled.

16:25.181 --> 16:28.199
That much money on the line,
not a bad reason to kill him.

16:28.201 --> 16:30.234
Whoa.

16:30.236 --> 16:33.571
Assistant District Attorney Fred Simpson.
You know him?

16:33.573 --> 16:36.841
Only by reputation-- guy's
supposed to be a bulldog.

16:37.876 --> 16:39.677
TESS:
<i>So, where you been, Marco?</i>

16:39.679 --> 16:41.095
Trying to disappear?

16:41.097 --> 16:43.798
If I was trying to disappear,
I would have.

16:43.800 --> 16:47.084
I was dining in Long Island
with witnesses.

16:47.086 --> 16:49.053
Well, I understand you and
Nicholas had a pretty heated

16:49.055 --> 16:50.805
fight the other night.
Did we?

16:50.807 --> 16:53.257
Well, I guess the union
of commerce and culture

16:53.259 --> 16:55.426
is not always so unified.
Was he upset

16:55.428 --> 16:57.695
you were cheating him
out of his rightful cut?

16:58.730 --> 17:02.199
Painters loathe capitalism

17:02.201 --> 17:04.452
but they love the rewards.

17:04.454 --> 17:08.039
Or did he threaten to expose
your money laundering scam?

17:08.040 --> 17:09.624
Money laundering?
How else do you explain

17:09.626 --> 17:12.460
the prices you're getting
for Nicholas's work?

17:12.462 --> 17:14.561
Art is subjective.

17:14.564 --> 17:16.480
So is the price you pay for it.

17:16.482 --> 17:19.083
Is that what you told Assistant
District Attorney Simpson?

17:19.085 --> 17:20.685
'Cause I'm thinking you

17:20.686 --> 17:22.553
and ADA Simpson
were working together.

17:22.555 --> 17:24.472
You're mistaken.

17:24.473 --> 17:26.424
All right.

17:26.425 --> 17:29.310
Well, based on the invoices
we found in Nicholas's studio,

17:29.312 --> 17:30.845
and the duplicate paintings,

17:30.847 --> 17:33.180
we have enough to hold you
on false representation.

17:33.182 --> 17:36.067
I want my lawyer present.

17:36.069 --> 17:38.936
And I need my phone call.

17:38.938 --> 17:40.488
I have to let my curator know

17:40.490 --> 17:42.189
to cancel tonight's opening.

17:42.191 --> 17:43.908
The opening?

17:43.910 --> 17:45.526
Huh. You know,

17:45.528 --> 17:47.778
I've always been curious
about contemporary art.

17:47.780 --> 17:50.031
Oh, and I'll get right
on that phone call for you.

17:50.033 --> 17:52.533
Look at me,
running out the door.

17:52.535 --> 17:55.753
Fast as I can.

18:00.709 --> 18:04.011
Okay, I guess
there's no other way

18:04.013 --> 18:06.047
to do this than
just say it.

18:06.049 --> 18:08.799
Um...

18:08.801 --> 18:10.518
Dad, Brooke is married.

18:10.520 --> 18:12.603
(chuckles)
Is that all?

18:12.605 --> 18:14.271
Isn't that enough?

18:14.273 --> 18:15.973
It's not what you think.

18:15.975 --> 18:18.008
She's going through
a horrible divorce.

18:18.010 --> 18:21.228
Made more horrible by the fact
that she isn't divorced.

18:21.230 --> 18:22.863
Did you run
a background check on her?

18:22.865 --> 18:24.315
Yeah, but I...
Well, you know

18:24.317 --> 18:25.683
if you hadn't stopped
your research

18:25.685 --> 18:27.401
when you found
something to judge,

18:27.403 --> 18:29.036
you would have discovered
that the divorce was supposed

18:29.038 --> 18:30.538
to be finalized weeks ago.

18:30.540 --> 18:32.623
Brooke's husband's
still in love with her,

18:32.625 --> 18:34.692
so he made some
new demands, that's all.

18:34.694 --> 18:36.811
I saw them kiss.

18:39.047 --> 18:41.315
Brooke told me
that he followed her.

18:41.317 --> 18:43.200
He texted her from outside.

18:43.202 --> 18:44.969
Now I'm sure
she didn't return this kiss.

18:44.971 --> 18:46.387
Yes, she pushed him away,

18:46.389 --> 18:48.589
but she just didn't
want anyone to see.

18:48.591 --> 18:51.976
I-I think she's using you.

18:53.979 --> 18:56.580
Catherine, have you ever
stopped to ask yourself

18:56.582 --> 18:59.400
why I didn't tell you
about her divorce myself?

18:59.402 --> 19:00.868
I am worried about you.

19:00.870 --> 19:02.970
Because no one's worthy
in your eyes.

19:02.972 --> 19:08.192
Now, this judgmental attitude
may make you a good cop,

19:08.194 --> 19:10.444
but it also makes it
very difficult

19:10.446 --> 19:12.730
to have a relationship with you.

19:26.628 --> 19:28.713
Art openings are pretentious.
We just figure out

19:28.715 --> 19:31.182
where the money is coming from,
and we get out of there.

19:31.184 --> 19:33.434
TESS: Unless we meet
some handsome art lover.

19:33.436 --> 19:35.252
(chuckles)
Focus.

19:35.254 --> 19:37.204
I checked
Nicholas's credit reports.

19:37.206 --> 19:38.656
He applied for an apartment
two days ago.

19:38.658 --> 19:39.974
According to the landlady,

19:39.976 --> 19:41.559
he was gonna move in
with his girlfriend.

19:41.561 --> 19:43.894
What are you wearing, anyway?

19:43.896 --> 19:45.196
Whatever's clean.

19:45.198 --> 19:46.814
He was moving in
with a girlfriend

19:46.816 --> 19:48.733
who dumped him
two weeks earlier?

19:48.735 --> 19:50.401
That <i>is</i> wishful thinking.

19:50.403 --> 19:51.786
Hey, what are you wearing?

19:51.788 --> 19:55.456
Heather's shoes, apparently.

19:55.458 --> 19:58.159
I'll see you there.

20:06.668 --> 20:08.586
Hi.

20:08.588 --> 20:10.337
I'm in a hurry, Vincent.

20:10.339 --> 20:12.506
I'm on my way to a case.

20:14.059 --> 20:16.727
A little overdressed
for a case.

20:16.729 --> 20:18.128
Murdered painter.

20:18.130 --> 20:21.432
Going to a
gallery opening.

20:23.018 --> 20:24.802
Vincent...

20:24.804 --> 20:27.271
what are you doing here?

20:27.273 --> 20:30.741
I was just in the neighborhood.

20:32.862 --> 20:35.362
Yeah.

moving in one direction,

20:37.166 --> 20:39.250

Catherine,

20:39.252 --> 20:40.668
I know that...

20:40.670 --> 20:43.153
you can't wait around

20:43.155 --> 20:45.706
You... you don't have
to let me down easy.

20:45.708 --> 20:47.808

32:50.618 --> 32:51.950
Nicholas's girlfriend--
those paintings

32:51.952 --> 32:53.735
in the studio, all of her.

32:53.737 --> 32:54.953
Was she at the gallery tonight?

32:54.955 --> 32:56.538
Yeah. She said
she barely knew the guy.

32:56.540 --> 32:58.073
But when I mentioned
the apartment that he leased,

32:58.075 --> 32:59.625
she took off.
I don't think she realized

32:59.627 --> 33:01.243
he wanted to move in with her.

33:01.245 --> 33:03.161
Well, if she was his girlfriend,
wouldn't she know?

33:03.163 --> 33:05.196
Unless someone made her doubt
that he loved her.

33:05.198 --> 33:07.532
And the person who
wouldn't want her to move in

33:07.534 --> 33:09.051
with her boyfriend is her pimp.

33:09.053 --> 33:10.502
No, try madame--
Lauren, the curator,

33:10.504 --> 33:12.087
she conveniently left
the gallery

33:12.089 --> 33:14.306
right after she saw me.
Makes sense.

33:14.308 --> 33:16.374
Found this at the studio.

33:16.376 --> 33:18.093
People are supposed to use
those when they move art.

33:18.095 --> 33:20.211
Yeah, "people" as in a curator
with a gallery show.

33:20.213 --> 33:21.597
Could explain our white fibers.

33:21.599 --> 33:23.765
I had a unit put on
Lauren's apartment.

33:23.767 --> 33:26.318
Our conniving curator got
home ten minutes ago.

33:26.320 --> 33:28.820
Anyone else enter the building
in the last ten minutes?

33:28.822 --> 33:30.272
Yeah, a woman, early 20s.

33:30.274 --> 33:32.991
Green dress?
Yeah.

33:34.744 --> 33:37.228
LAUREN: Just calm down.
We can talk this through.

33:37.230 --> 33:38.664
DAPHNE:
You lied to me!

33:38.666 --> 33:40.249
LAUREN:
I was protecting you!

33:40.251 --> 33:42.751
That's Lauren's apartment.

33:42.753 --> 33:45.587
DAPHNE: He was the best thing
that ever happened to me!

33:45.589 --> 33:47.339
The only man
that I ever loved!

33:47.341 --> 33:48.757
LAUREN:
I know you're upset.

33:48.759 --> 33:50.959
NYPD! Open up!

33:50.961 --> 33:54.212
DAPHNE: He's dead, and I
can never get him back!

33:54.214 --> 33:55.580
LAUREN: It's been
a terrible shock,

33:55.582 --> 34:00.418
but I swear I had nothing
to do with this, Daphne.

34:00.420 --> 34:02.554
Drop your weapon!
Daphne, don't do this.

34:02.556 --> 34:03.689
You couldn't stand
the thought

34:03.691 --> 34:05.607
that I might actually be happy.

34:05.609 --> 34:06.892
Nicholas wouldn't want this
for you.

34:06.894 --> 34:09.478
She told me I was
just a call girl,

34:09.480 --> 34:11.362
that I meant nothing
to him,

34:11.364 --> 34:13.764
that I wasn't worthy of love.

34:13.766 --> 34:15.367
He was gonna leave you anyways.

34:15.369 --> 34:16.601
They always do.

34:16.603 --> 34:18.268
And Lauren didn't want
to miss one

34:18.271 --> 34:20.205
of her best moneymakers,
isn't that right?

34:20.206 --> 34:22.157
He swore to me he wasn't
sleeping with any of the other girls,

34:22.159 --> 34:24.493
but I didn't believe him
because of your lies.

34:24.495 --> 34:26.110
Nicholas knew he had to get
Daphne away from you.

34:26.112 --> 34:27.629
That's what that phone
call was about;

34:27.630 --> 34:28.996
not the price of the paintings,

34:28.998 --> 34:30.281
but the price
of Daphne's freedom.

34:30.283 --> 34:32.384
What?
It's not true.

34:32.386 --> 34:34.719
But he didn't have the money
to buy her out,

34:34.722 --> 34:36.121
so what did he do, Lauren,

34:36.123 --> 34:37.806
threaten to expose
the entire operation?

34:37.808 --> 34:39.558
Turn over that client list?

34:41.811 --> 34:44.846
I wasn't gonna jeopardize
everything for a stupid whore.

34:44.848 --> 34:46.063
You killed him!

34:46.065 --> 34:47.683
And if you kill her,

34:47.685 --> 34:49.400
you will be
throwing your life away.

34:49.402 --> 34:52.521
Daphne, Nicholas, he...

34:52.523 --> 34:55.690
he saw your true worth.

34:55.693 --> 34:58.527
He did.
He loved you.

35:01.447 --> 35:04.315
He loved you.

35:04.317 --> 35:07.035
Put the gun down.

35:10.256 --> 35:13.041
Put down your gun.

35:22.135 --> 35:24.302
(sighs)

35:41.320 --> 35:42.788
Daphne won't be charged.

35:42.790 --> 35:44.539
I just got off
the phone with the DA's Office.

35:44.541 --> 35:45.874
They agreed that her statement
will help make

35:45.876 --> 35:47.626
the murder and pandering
charges stick.

35:47.628 --> 35:49.211
Nice work, partner.
Thanks. Hey, I'll buy you

35:49.213 --> 35:50.579
a beer if you buy me one.

35:50.581 --> 35:52.581
You are on. I just need
to do a couple things.

35:52.583 --> 35:54.082
I'll meet you in, like, an hour?
Yeah.

35:54.084 --> 35:55.634
Careful. Last time I made plans
with Catherine,

35:55.636 --> 35:56.918
I ended up in a bordello.

35:56.920 --> 35:58.553
I'm gonna finish
my report...

35:58.555 --> 36:00.538
over there, by myself.

36:01.557 --> 36:03.725
Congratulations,
Detective Chandler.

36:03.727 --> 36:05.043
And if I haven't
said it already,

36:05.045 --> 36:06.645
you were great last night.

36:06.647 --> 36:08.563
Not quite the undercover
experience that I'm used to,

36:08.565 --> 36:10.649
but I think I acquitted
myself quite nicely.

36:10.651 --> 36:12.934
I think you enjoyed yourself
a little too much.

36:12.936 --> 36:15.053
Well, I could say
the same for you.

36:15.055 --> 36:18.240
I saw you slip out of
the gallery with someone.

36:18.242 --> 36:20.108
That was just a john
I was interviewing.

36:20.110 --> 36:21.860
He said he knew
everything about the scheme,

36:21.862 --> 36:23.278
but he didn't want
anyone to overhear.

36:23.280 --> 36:25.396
Funny, I didn't peg him
as a client.

36:25.398 --> 36:28.033
He shows up to an upscale escort
party wearing street clothes

36:28.035 --> 36:30.435
and the only woman he wanted
to talk to is you.

36:30.437 --> 36:34.790
Evan, a certain kind of woman
would take that as an insult.

36:34.792 --> 36:38.260
Then let me make it up to you.
Dinner, no chaperone.

36:38.262 --> 36:41.246
I think I'm gonna have
to take a rain check.

36:41.248 --> 36:44.466
Has to rain sometime, Cat.
I'll wait.

36:44.468 --> 36:46.384
You're very confident.

36:46.386 --> 36:49.137
And patient.

37:00.366 --> 37:02.317
You look beautiful.

37:02.319 --> 37:04.653
What are you doing here?

37:04.655 --> 37:07.873
I... owe you an apology.

37:07.875 --> 37:09.825
You think?

37:09.827 --> 37:11.793
Yes. I made, like,
a hundred assumptions

37:11.795 --> 37:13.779
and I acted like an idiot.

37:13.781 --> 37:17.549
A huge, jumbo-sized idiot.

37:19.001 --> 37:21.452
But you wouldn't have had
to make so many assumptions

37:21.454 --> 37:24.172
if I'd just been honest.

37:24.174 --> 37:27.008
Your approval means
a lot to your dad.

37:29.779 --> 37:34.316
Anyone would be lucky to have
you as part of their family.

37:34.318 --> 37:37.602
(both laugh gently)

37:42.808 --> 37:44.593
CATHERINE:
<i>I waited all night for you.</i>

37:47.113 --> 37:49.414
When I left--

37:49.416 --> 37:52.100
No, not, not tonight,

37:52.102 --> 37:55.770
um, when you didn't
show up for dinner.

37:58.758 --> 38:00.091
But it seems like that's what

38:00.093 --> 38:02.661
I do the most
with my time these days...

38:02.663 --> 38:06.298
wait for the next moment
I get to see you.

38:08.968 --> 38:14.022
Vincent, it never even occurred
to me that you didn't know

38:14.024 --> 38:16.775
that you are the best
thing in my life right now.

38:19.362 --> 38:21.646
I guess seeing me kiss
another guy

38:21.648 --> 38:23.481
doesn't really help my chances.

38:23.483 --> 38:25.350
(both laugh quietly)

38:28.454 --> 38:31.756
I don't know how to do this.

38:31.758 --> 38:34.910
(sighs)

38:36.746 --> 38:40.215
You know, that, uh,

38:40.217 --> 38:45.020
artist's studio was, like, six
blocks from where I grew up.

38:45.022 --> 38:47.589
Being back there
kind of got me thinking

38:47.591 --> 38:49.874
about who I used to be.

38:51.710 --> 38:53.395
You know, if that
Vincent Keller

38:53.397 --> 38:55.096
had seen you with
another guy,

38:55.098 --> 38:56.398
he probably would've, uh...

38:56.400 --> 38:59.768
smacked him square
in the mouth.

38:59.770 --> 39:01.653
(chuckles)

39:01.655 --> 39:05.073
Does it make me a terrible
person to admit that I'm glad

39:05.075 --> 39:06.741
the thought crossed your mind?

39:06.743 --> 39:08.977
No.

39:12.365 --> 39:16.151
Who I am makes everything seem
impossible.

39:16.153 --> 39:18.203
No.

39:20.840 --> 39:23.675
Who you are...

39:23.677 --> 39:27.128
it makes everything worth it.

39:32.468 --> 39:34.686
Vincent, I have to go.

39:58.377 --> 40:00.378
(gasping)

40:09.305 --> 40:11.056
(gasping)

40:11.058 --> 40:13.591
