00:03.295 --> 00:04.588
Previously on Future Man...

00:04.671 --> 00:07.090
What happened, you spaz
out playing Biotic Wars?

00:07.174 --> 00:09.343
Smash your joystick again?

00:09.426 --> 00:11.887
Santiago!

00:14.806 --> 00:17.476
Thanks to you I've made
all my research public.

00:17.559 --> 00:19.895
Time to die, Dr. Death.

00:26.652 --> 00:28.445
Wait, that's Carl, he's human!

00:28.528 --> 00:30.572
I know these people, I work with them!

00:30.656 --> 00:34.076
Of course you do,
Biotics could be anybody.

00:34.159 --> 00:36.245
That's what makes this so fucked up.

00:39.308 --> 00:43.836

00:51.093 --> 00:52.886
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

00:52.970 --> 00:54.304
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

00:54.388 --> 00:56.098
- Stop shitting!
- Fuck, fuck!

00:56.181 --> 00:57.781
Why didn't the game say they were human?

00:59.017 --> 01:00.477
Because we didn't want to humanize them!

01:00.560 --> 01:01.895
What's with their nutsack faces?

01:01.979 --> 01:03.939
That's biomembrane,
it helps them heal faster.

01:04.022 --> 01:05.440
- Why'd you block our shot?
- Oh my god,

01:05.524 --> 01:06.817
those are people that
I fucking work with.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.527
Barely people, they're grown in labs!

01:08.610 --> 01:10.779
Why the fuck did you block our shot?

01:10.862 --> 01:13.156
Because killing Kronish
won't help, all right?

01:13.240 --> 01:14.241
His research is already out there,

01:14.324 --> 01:15.617
the cure can come from anyone!

01:15.701 --> 01:17.911
Yeah, because of you, you dick weevil.

01:17.995 --> 01:19.975
- Are there more of these things?
- Absolutely!

01:20.000 --> 01:20.924
Hit it!

01:20.949 --> 01:23.959
Sleeper agents, they knew
he came back to 2017,

01:24.042 --> 01:26.044
they sent them earlier
to hide in plain sight.

01:26.128 --> 01:29.298
- That's kind of cool I guess.
- Let's just leave them here.

01:29.381 --> 01:33.051
No, no, guys, you can't
just leave them anywhere.

01:33.135 --> 01:35.429
You can't leave anything
from the future in the past,

01:35.512 --> 01:38.390
especially not these genetically
perfect mutant creatures

01:38.473 --> 01:40.142
with nutsack membrane faces!

01:40.225 --> 01:41.685
If these things got into
the wrong hands who knows

01:41.768 --> 01:43.812
what kind of future
you guys would have left.

01:43.895 --> 01:47.858
Come on, this is Time Travel 101.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.402
Okay, then how do we get rid of them?

01:53.530 --> 01:55.157
Oh, fuck.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.826
I think I know how.

02:01.204 --> 02:05.250
Why is this human body
disposal unit so small?

02:05.334 --> 02:06.574
Well, it's really only designed

02:06.626 --> 02:09.086
for incinerating dead possums.

02:09.170 --> 02:10.756
Dr. Kronish's big breakthrough came

02:10.839 --> 02:12.090
from studying their DNA.

02:12.174 --> 02:14.092
I guess there's something super special

02:14.176 --> 02:16.511
about their ejaculate.

02:16.595 --> 02:18.013
How do they die?

02:18.096 --> 02:20.307
Well, sometimes the lab techs need

02:20.390 --> 02:21.850
a lot of their ejaculate,

02:21.933 --> 02:23.352
so they stimulate the possum

02:23.435 --> 02:26.313
and make it cum more than natural,

02:26.396 --> 02:29.483
and I guess they push it too far,

02:29.566 --> 02:33.695
and the possum cums to death.

02:33.779 --> 02:36.114
How often does that happen?

02:36.198 --> 02:40.535
Often enough we had
to get an incinerator.

02:40.619 --> 02:41.745
Huh.

02:43.413 --> 02:44.413
Well...

02:46.792 --> 02:48.251
Let's get to it.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:01.348 --> 03:03.225
I can't watch this anymore.

03:03.308 --> 03:04.935
Hey.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.895
You better fucking watch this, okay?

03:06.978 --> 03:09.356
Because you need to know
how to take out these perfs.

03:09.381 --> 03:10.374
Perfs?

03:10.399 --> 03:13.944
We call these genetically
perfect assholes.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.737
Not so perfect anymore!

03:17.531 --> 03:20.325
All right, what was this one's name?

03:20.409 --> 03:23.328
I don't know, I never talked with her.

03:23.412 --> 03:25.163
She's just so pretty.

03:25.247 --> 03:28.208
Yeah, they're all fucking
pretty on the outside.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.168
I always called her Pretty Smile Girl.

03:30.252 --> 03:31.586
All right, imagine this,

03:31.670 --> 03:33.255
Pretty Smile Girl, she's coming at you

03:33.338 --> 03:34.714
and all you have is your shredder blade.

03:34.798 --> 03:36.550
You stab Pretty Smile Girl in the liver.

03:36.633 --> 03:37.843
That's a fucking kill.

03:37.926 --> 03:40.679
You stab Pretty Smile Girl
in the heart, that's a kill.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.347
But Pretty Smile Girl's head?

03:42.431 --> 03:43.640
You're going to want to be real careful

03:43.723 --> 03:44.933
of Pretty Smile Girl's head.

03:45.016 --> 03:47.269
Can we please just leave
Pretty Smile Girl's head alone?

03:47.352 --> 03:49.062
No.

03:49.146 --> 03:53.608
Every Biotic soldier has a
bomb implanted in their head.

03:53.692 --> 03:57.654
If a Biotic's about to be
captured, they trigger this.

03:57.737 --> 03:58.780
Brain bomb.

03:58.864 --> 04:01.533
It blows their heads so
they can't be interrogated.

04:01.616 --> 04:03.618
It also sends a distress
signal to the future

04:03.702 --> 04:06.455
telling the Biotics
to send reinforcements.

04:06.538 --> 04:08.858
I really feel like you should've
included that in the game.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.375
That's why we spend
a year of combat-training

04:10.459 --> 04:14.087
just learning how to stab right there.

04:14.171 --> 04:15.839
It won't kill them,

04:15.922 --> 04:18.132
but it does disable the bomb.

04:22.345 --> 04:23.346
Noted.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.223
One more for the gobulator.

04:29.519 --> 04:32.522
Are you sure that's safe?

04:32.606 --> 04:34.775
Fuck you think a gobulator does?

04:44.534 --> 04:46.119
All right, Wolf, fire up the TTD.

04:46.203 --> 04:47.579
Let's go back to earlier today

04:47.662 --> 04:50.207
before Future Man fucked everything up.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.625
Take out Kronish.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.502
No, no, you guys don't get it.

04:53.585 --> 04:56.421
Kronish has been doing this
research his entire life.

04:56.505 --> 04:57.964
Okay, even if you went
back and killed him,

04:58.048 --> 04:59.466
somebody else could just
pick up where he left off

04:59.549 --> 05:01.843
and the cure would still be created.

05:01.927 --> 05:04.763
I mean, the only way
you could be sure is to...

05:04.846 --> 05:07.015
I don't know, you'd have to do
a full-on Terminator thing.

05:07.098 --> 05:09.434
Go back and stop him
before he was ever born.

05:09.518 --> 05:12.979
Or we kill him when he's one
of those little baby things.

05:13.063 --> 05:15.899
No, absolutely not,
you cannot kill a baby.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.360
- They're invincible?
- No, they are helpless

05:18.443 --> 05:20.821
- and they're very soft.
- Perfect, easy kill.

05:20.904 --> 05:22.823
Yeah, give us a date.

05:22.906 --> 05:25.283
- That fucker!
- What?

05:25.367 --> 05:29.287
The TTD got damaged in the fight.

05:29.371 --> 05:30.956
Shit, that's not a lot of Cameronium.

05:31.039 --> 05:33.375
Maybe enough for one
more jump if we're lucky.

05:33.458 --> 05:34.709
What the hell is Cameronium?

05:34.793 --> 05:36.878
It's the fuel the TTD runs off of.

05:36.962 --> 05:38.755
Talk about Time Travel 101.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.882
All right, this is what we do.

05:40.966 --> 05:43.343
We use our last jump, we go
back, we kill baby Kronish.

05:43.426 --> 05:45.387
That, that is the new mission.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.556
No, no!

05:47.639 --> 05:49.975
Killing a baby is absolutely wrong

05:50.058 --> 05:52.227
and it makes us the monsters.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.771
Agree to disagree, give us a date.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.106
I don't know when he was born.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.983
Wolf, choke it out of him.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.694
- Gladly.
- No, no, no, no.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.863
No, no!

06:02.946 --> 06:05.407
If you can't jump back to your time,

06:05.490 --> 06:06.741
then you'll never know if your mission

06:06.825 --> 06:08.618
was a success or not.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.371
What if killing Kronish
doesn't actually work?

06:11.454 --> 06:14.791
- It'll work.
- Are you sure?

06:14.875 --> 06:17.210
Don't you want proof?

06:19.921 --> 06:22.632
I mean, what do you even
really know about time travel?

06:22.716 --> 06:25.468
Do you know about multiverses?

06:25.552 --> 06:27.929
Or alternate realities?

06:28.013 --> 06:29.639
Or what about time loops?

06:29.723 --> 06:32.267
Because if you're wrong
about one of those things

06:32.350 --> 06:34.269
then your mission will
be a complete failure

06:34.352 --> 06:37.981
and you'll be stuck in the past forever.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.483
Fine, we'll find more Cameronium here,

06:40.567 --> 06:41.985
and then we are going back

06:42.068 --> 06:44.112
and we're killing little baby Kronish.

06:44.195 --> 06:46.448
Where's the closest Cameronium outpost?

06:46.531 --> 06:50.160
I just told you I don't even
know what Cameronium is.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.954
It's biofuel, it's been around forever.

06:53.038 --> 06:56.041
- What's it made of?
- I... plants, I don't know!

06:56.124 --> 07:00.295
You tell us, you're the scientist.

07:00.378 --> 07:02.047
You work in a laboratory.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.257
That's your science wand.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.179
What is your job here?

07:12.432 --> 07:14.059
A fucking janitor?

07:14.142 --> 07:16.978
Do you know who's a janitor
where we come from?

07:17.062 --> 07:19.064
- A robot?
- Nobody!

07:19.147 --> 07:20.482
Because in a battle of survival,

07:20.565 --> 07:22.567
no one gives a dick about clean floors!

07:22.651 --> 07:24.152
I knew he wasn't the savior,
I knew it the minute

07:24.235 --> 07:25.737
he jizzed all over my torso!

07:25.820 --> 07:27.238
- I can still help!
- No, no, no.

07:27.322 --> 07:29.115
You can't, we don't need you.

07:29.199 --> 07:30.659
You get in the way, you're weak,

07:30.742 --> 07:33.536
you fucking inspired Kronish
to share the cure!

07:33.620 --> 07:37.916
And on a personal level,
I'm not sure I like you.

07:37.999 --> 07:41.336
You're off the team, Futterman.

07:41.419 --> 07:44.839
Even your name's a disappointment.

07:44.923 --> 07:46.591
Guys, don't do this!

07:46.675 --> 07:50.136
- Where are you going?
- To finish the mission without you.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.805
You're covered in brains!

07:51.888 --> 07:53.556
Eat a dick!

08:41.020 --> 08:43.063
Keep your eyes peeled
from a Cameronium outpost.

08:43.148 --> 08:46.568
- Call 911.
- I want one of those.

08:50.321 --> 08:52.115
Best cock I've ever eaten.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.203
Hey, we're in luck.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.122
Green plus of Cameronium, see?

08:59.205 --> 09:01.166
We don't need that idiot.

09:03.168 --> 09:05.545
- Where's the Cameronium?
- I already told you,

09:05.628 --> 09:08.214
the most powerful stuff we
have is the Godfather OG Kush.

09:08.298 --> 09:10.467
It doesn't get any stronger than that.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.929
Cameronium is way stronger,
it'll skull-fuck

09:15.013 --> 09:17.432
your fucking OG Kush
to another dimension.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.642
Hey man, I'd love to try it sometime.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.978
If you track it down, hit me up.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.605
Go easy on those macaroons, dude.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.774
- Those are 20 mgs of pot.
- Huh?

09:27.859 --> 09:31.905
Shit, last thing we
need is more dead cops.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.406
More?

09:59.974 --> 10:04.437
Hey, what are you doing?
Get off the street!

10:14.405 --> 10:15.824
Okay, we can rule out the green truck

10:15.907 --> 10:17.387
as a Cameronium source, but I just...

10:17.450 --> 10:19.953
Owl said that no matter
what time we were in,

10:20.036 --> 10:23.873
we'd be able to find it.
What would Owl do if he were here?

10:23.957 --> 10:25.125
Nothing.

10:25.208 --> 10:28.753
Biotics put a merm in his
head and ate his brain.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.338
I watched him die.

10:30.421 --> 10:33.216
Yeah, I know, Wolf, I was there.

10:33.299 --> 10:37.178
Oh, oh, you're talking pre-merm Owl.

10:37.262 --> 10:39.430
Fuck yes, I'm talking pre-merm Owl.

10:39.514 --> 10:43.476
You know what's crazy?

10:43.560 --> 10:45.311
We're time travelers.

10:45.395 --> 10:46.855
What the fuck is wrong
with you right now?

10:46.938 --> 10:49.482
Why are you acting like
you're drunk off piss wine?

10:49.566 --> 10:51.693
Why are you acting so mean?

10:51.776 --> 10:53.194
Are you like actually mad,

10:53.278 --> 10:55.029
or are you just joking mad?

10:55.113 --> 10:56.364
You need to focus!

10:56.447 --> 10:58.741
We are in a time that
we know nothing about.

10:58.825 --> 11:02.370
Maybe sending a video game
back in time to find

11:02.453 --> 11:06.541
humanity's savior was, like, a bad plan.

11:06.624 --> 11:07.834
Oh my god, you're not helping.

11:07.917 --> 11:11.004
You're just fucking shoving
street cock in your mouth

11:11.087 --> 11:13.214
and looking at your hands
for 45 minutes.

11:13.298 --> 11:16.134
- That cock was so delicious.
- You're going soft on me.

11:16.217 --> 11:17.886
Do you realize it's just us now?

11:17.969 --> 11:19.804
We're the only ones left.

11:19.888 --> 11:22.223
I need you to stay hard.

11:22.307 --> 11:24.058
- I am hard.
- Rock hard?

11:24.142 --> 11:26.227
So god damn fucking hard solid.

11:26.311 --> 11:30.064
- Solid as a fucking rock?
- Yeah!

11:30.148 --> 11:33.401
Then prove it.

11:33.484 --> 11:34.944
Eat that rat.

11:53.338 --> 11:56.132
God, this is so disgusting.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.426
Get the fuck out, no,
you're not allowed.

11:58.509 --> 12:00.178
Back up from whence you came.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.555
This is the command center
for the resistance.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.140
- Please, listen.
- No, there's no Futtermans

12:04.224 --> 12:05.350
allowed, there's no janitors allowed,

12:05.433 --> 12:07.435
there is no one shorter
than us allowed down here.

12:07.518 --> 12:09.646
Okay, I know that you're
like super pissed

12:09.729 --> 12:11.648
at me right now, but I have an idea

12:11.731 --> 12:13.316
and I swear to you it's going to work.

12:13.399 --> 12:14.567
We've got this shit figured out,

12:14.651 --> 12:15.985
we're fine without you.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.154
We've got a plan, we're
rolling out a new plan.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.782
We've got a lot of leads,
Wolf has some leads.

12:20.865 --> 12:24.077
- Wolf?
- I don't have any leads.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.955
Guys, please, let me back on the team.

12:27.038 --> 12:28.039
Get cleaned up.

12:28.122 --> 12:30.291
I know where to get more Cameronium.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.675
I don't remember buying
this, then I realized

12:38.758 --> 12:41.970
- it was my dad's Fleshlight.
- Oh, that makes sense, yeah.

12:42.053 --> 12:44.305
And nothing's changed here, okay.

12:44.389 --> 12:45.890
Well, look who's back again.

12:45.974 --> 12:48.351
You break another joystick
playing Biotic Wars or...?

12:48.434 --> 12:50.353
Uh, no, I stopped playing.

12:50.436 --> 12:54.524
Those characters were so unrealistic.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.943
Boing.

12:57.026 --> 13:00.613
Hey, you're still dating that,
like, chemist guy, right?

13:00.697 --> 13:03.157
- The professor dude?
- Lyle?

13:03.241 --> 13:06.577
No, we broke up, I call
him Professor Ex now.

13:06.661 --> 13:07.745
That's funny.

13:07.829 --> 13:09.622
Was it like a bad messy kind of breakup

13:09.706 --> 13:11.499
or the kind where you
could like casually

13:11.582 --> 13:13.001
put me in contact with him?

13:13.084 --> 13:14.419
No, I mean, I hate him, he used to wear

13:14.502 --> 13:17.005
a button-down shirt every
time we fucked, I hate him.

13:17.088 --> 13:18.965
- Why do you ask?
- Oh, no, nothing.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.050
I just, I started taking these classes

13:21.134 --> 13:24.637
at a community college,
and my first assignment

13:24.721 --> 13:27.473
actually was to interview
a chemist and I thought...

13:27.557 --> 13:29.475
Oh yeah, what community
college are you at?

13:29.559 --> 13:33.771
Uh, it's the California
Community College.

13:33.855 --> 13:35.535
Oh yeah, I've literally
never heard of that

13:35.606 --> 13:36.858
community college in my life.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.985
It's good, yeah, it's good.

13:41.070 --> 13:44.407
Hey, can I help you?

13:44.490 --> 13:46.868
I can't imagine a situation
where you could.

13:46.951 --> 13:49.829
Oh, nice, the game's afoot.

13:49.912 --> 13:52.415
I've got to say, this
is a pretty dope cosplay.

13:52.498 --> 13:55.668
What is this, Armor Craft
Foam or Wonderflex?

13:55.752 --> 13:58.421
It's titanium PX3900 exoshield.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.715
Bulletproof, laser-proof, claw-proof.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.050
Oh, you're funny, I like that.

14:02.133 --> 14:04.427
Don't touch me, don't ever touch me.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.637
Shopkeep, I have some questions

14:06.721 --> 14:09.599
about this little boy's
murder simulator.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.642
I'm with a customer.

14:11.726 --> 14:15.438
Anyway, you gonna hit up
Dragon Con this year or what?

14:15.521 --> 14:17.732
I swear to you, it's a real school!

14:17.815 --> 14:20.443
Oh yeah, what's the mascot
for your real school?

14:20.526 --> 14:22.653
It's a real bird!

14:22.737 --> 14:24.405
You're a terrible liar like Pinocchio,

14:24.489 --> 14:26.532
and Pinocchio was wack.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.037
Ow!

14:31.120 --> 14:32.789
Why would you talk to someone

14:32.872 --> 14:34.207
who doesn't want to talk to you?

14:34.290 --> 14:36.709
Because I'm a guy, okay, just let me go!

14:36.793 --> 14:38.252
Futterman, you know this chick?

14:38.336 --> 14:40.505
No, no, I don't.

14:40.588 --> 14:44.008
Fine, fine, next time he loses the arm.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.510
Wait a second.

14:49.639 --> 14:52.725
Did you hire like a super
strong hooker to dress up

14:52.809 --> 14:54.685
like the girl from Biotic Wars?

14:54.769 --> 14:56.270
No, I actually didn't.

14:56.354 --> 14:58.022
What a nasty freak he is.

14:58.106 --> 14:59.232
She doesn't even look like her.

14:59.315 --> 15:00.650
Okay, you know what, we're wasting time.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.527
Whoa, no, stop, he's going to have

15:02.610 --> 15:03.820
a conversation over here real quick.

15:03.903 --> 15:07.657
What the fuck, man?

15:07.740 --> 15:10.868
Okay, look, for the first time ever,

15:10.952 --> 15:12.787
my life has meaning.

15:12.870 --> 15:15.123
Okay, I have found a true purpose.

15:15.206 --> 15:19.210
I can help a lot of people,
but in order to do that

15:19.293 --> 15:21.629
I believe it is vital
for me to get in contact

15:21.712 --> 15:24.799
with your ex for my quest.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.592
What do you say?

15:26.676 --> 15:28.761
- Oh, wow.
- He's pretty stupid.

15:28.845 --> 15:30.304
- Yeah.
- He's pretty stupid.

15:30.388 --> 15:32.431
It's really like... like you had me

15:32.515 --> 15:34.267
and then you just totally lost me.

15:34.350 --> 15:35.350
You know what, fuck it.

15:35.393 --> 15:36.853
I'm just going to tell
you guys the truth, okay?

15:36.936 --> 15:38.980
I beat the Biotic Wars
and it turns out that game

15:39.063 --> 15:41.023
was actually a simulator
sent back from the future

15:41.107 --> 15:42.900
to find humanity's savior, which is me,

15:42.984 --> 15:44.569
and now our time machine
is all out of fuel

15:44.652 --> 15:46.154
and we need to find more,
which is why I hope

15:46.237 --> 15:47.655
your ex can help us get more fuel.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.323
So, that's it, all the fate of humanity

15:49.407 --> 15:52.702
depends upon this moment
right here and now.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.832
Why didn't you just open with that, bro?

15:57.915 --> 15:59.375
Yeah, come on, we're here to help.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.919
- Get that address.
- For real?

16:02.003 --> 16:05.506
Here's Lyle, I hope he can help.

16:05.590 --> 16:07.008
Great, thank you.

16:07.091 --> 16:08.509
Yeah, good luck saving humanity.

16:08.534 --> 16:09.569
Thank you very much.

16:09.594 --> 16:10.928
- Get that time travel juice.
- All right!

16:11.012 --> 16:13.556
- Hey guys, let's go!
- All right.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.183
See you guys, come on, let's go.

16:15.266 --> 16:17.977
- All right.
- Freak.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.645
He is totally going to kill somebody.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.147
Hopefully Lyle.

16:21.230 --> 16:22.440
See, I got us the address, guys.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.025
Aren't you glad I'm back on the team?

16:24.108 --> 16:26.861
Your cover story fell apart
like a shit in your hands.

16:26.944 --> 16:28.362
Well, like you could
do any better, Wolf.

16:28.446 --> 16:31.449
I could, I'm better
than you at everything.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.534
Man, what's with this negativity?

16:33.618 --> 16:35.912
Like, that plan totally worked,
we're like a dream team,

16:35.995 --> 16:37.371
- guys, come on.
- You're back on the team

16:37.455 --> 16:40.333
on a provisional basis only,
please remember that.

16:40.416 --> 16:43.419
Yes, Tiger, you've made
that abundantly clear to me.

16:43.502 --> 16:46.714
Look, can you please put on Mom's coat?

16:46.797 --> 16:49.675
- You look really ridiculous.
- What?

16:49.759 --> 16:52.678
Come on, Wolf's rocking
my dad's shit too.

16:52.762 --> 16:54.305
- Here.
- Fine.

16:54.388 --> 16:56.349
Only because you got us the address.

16:56.432 --> 16:59.560
And a ride to the address.

16:59.644 --> 17:00.686
- Futterman?
- Right here.

17:00.770 --> 17:03.022
All right, let's go, team.

17:03.105 --> 17:06.233
♪ I wear my sunglasses at night ♪

17:06.317 --> 17:08.569
Pilot, what is this music?

17:08.659 --> 17:11.369
I think it's Corey Hart.

17:11.446 --> 17:13.156
I like Corey Hart.

17:13.241 --> 17:16.077
Wolf likes something, turn that shit up.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.578
All right!

17:17.662 --> 17:21.249
♪ I wear my sunglasses at night ♪

17:21.332 --> 17:25.711
♪ So I can, so I can ♪

17:25.795 --> 17:26.963
No, no, no.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.673
You're off the mark, Corbin.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.091
I need you to go back
to the drawing board,

17:30.174 --> 17:32.093
have a sandwich, just start over.

17:32.176 --> 17:34.387
- Excuse me?
- Professor Karofsky.

17:34.470 --> 17:38.933
Hi, I am Josh Pastman from Kronish Labs.

17:39.016 --> 17:39.934
Um...

17:40.017 --> 17:42.436
- This is my assistant, he's...
- Corey Wolfhart.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.439
That's quite a grip, Mr. Wolfhart.

17:45.523 --> 17:46.899
You can let go.

17:46.983 --> 17:48.401
And this is my other assistant...

17:48.484 --> 17:52.697
Tiger, I'm his mission commander.

17:52.780 --> 17:55.283
I swear, it feels like it sometimes.

17:55.366 --> 17:57.118
Tiger?

17:57.201 --> 17:59.287
Yeah, that's her Burning Man name.

17:59.370 --> 18:03.291
Huh, I'm never more myself
than when I'm at the Burn.

18:03.374 --> 18:05.793
Namaste, what can I help you with?

18:05.876 --> 18:07.196
Well, basically over at the labs,

18:07.253 --> 18:09.171
we've got this special
piece of equipment

18:09.255 --> 18:11.799
that utilizes a very unique biofuel

18:11.882 --> 18:14.260
and unfortunately, the manufacturer

18:14.343 --> 18:15.928
is kind of jamming us up right now,

18:16.012 --> 18:17.430
and we were hoping you
could take a look at it,

18:17.513 --> 18:19.140
tell us what it's made of, and you know,

18:19.223 --> 18:21.684
maybe where we can find some more of it.

18:21.767 --> 18:25.730
Home Depot or Lowe's or some other...

18:25.813 --> 18:27.523
Listen, kid.

18:27.607 --> 18:31.360
I would love to help you
solve your work problem

18:31.444 --> 18:36.157
for no compensation, but...

18:36.240 --> 18:40.077
- That's a biofuel?
- That's correct.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.876
What kind of machine did you say

18:46.959 --> 18:49.211
you were running with this?

18:49.295 --> 18:51.839
It's like a centrifuge.

18:51.922 --> 18:55.468
- What kind of centrifuge?
- Uh, it's a big one.

18:55.551 --> 18:58.220
All right, what's it made of?

18:58.304 --> 19:02.850
Looks like microorganisms
living in salt water.

19:02.933 --> 19:05.686
Okay, let me run this
through the calorimeter.

19:18.908 --> 19:21.452
Hachi machi.

19:21.535 --> 19:23.329
My equipment here is a bit rudimentary.

19:23.412 --> 19:25.206
So I'm going to take this in the back

19:25.289 --> 19:28.042
and run some more advanced
tests, wait here.

19:28.125 --> 19:31.712
No, we are not letting
that out of our sight.

19:31.796 --> 19:34.382
Because it's very, very important to us.

19:34.465 --> 19:35.549
It's the last bit of our fuel,

19:35.633 --> 19:37.718
so we'd love to come with you.

19:37.802 --> 19:40.388
Okay, it's a clean room back there

19:40.471 --> 19:42.848
and I only have two hazmat suits.

19:42.932 --> 19:46.727
So the tennis pro is going
to have to wait here.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.774
- Stay hard.
- I am hard.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.484
Yeah.

20:30.438 --> 20:34.108
You know, the reason I got into biofuel

20:34.191 --> 20:37.153
is because I knew that climate change

20:37.236 --> 20:39.697
would bring about the annihilation

20:39.780 --> 20:41.991
of the entire human species.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.702
Climate change, he could
not be more wrong.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.787
You call yourself a Burner?

20:46.871 --> 20:49.457
People like you are the
reason that my department

20:49.540 --> 20:52.042
gets no funding, the
reason that my girlfriend

20:52.126 --> 20:56.130
left me because my
canola oil powered moped

20:56.213 --> 20:59.967
isn't sexy enough for her.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.594
Who cares if it's sexy?

21:01.677 --> 21:03.637
You are the reason I've had to do

21:03.721 --> 21:07.975
so many unsavory things,
which I'm not proud of,

21:08.058 --> 21:09.393
to keep my research going.

21:09.477 --> 21:11.520
Tiger, Tiger. He's a bad guy.

21:11.604 --> 21:15.107
But this, this is the energy solution

21:15.191 --> 21:17.777
that I've been looking
for my entire life.

21:21.405 --> 21:24.617
This changes everything.

21:27.244 --> 21:31.207
Now...

21:31.290 --> 21:33.459
you are going to tell me

21:33.542 --> 21:35.795
everything you know about this.

21:35.878 --> 21:37.922
No more lies.

21:38.005 --> 21:39.715
Great work, janitor.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.267
That fucker!

21:50.351 --> 21:53.103
Yeah, get it in! Oh!

21:53.187 --> 21:55.564
It's like macaroons for my nose!

21:55.648 --> 21:57.358
Oh, what's this stuff called again?

21:57.441 --> 21:59.735
That's meth, baby, that's meth!

21:59.819 --> 22:03.155
Meth, meth!

22:03.239 --> 22:05.741
Oh, I could nose-eat
10 pounds of this stuff!

22:05.825 --> 22:07.827
Whoa, whoa, whoa, take it easy, kid!

22:07.910 --> 22:09.310
You're going to blow up your heart!

22:09.370 --> 22:12.206
Oh, how do I get more,
how do I get more?

22:12.289 --> 22:14.416
Where's it come from, what is it?

22:14.500 --> 22:17.044
Tell me everything you know!

22:17.127 --> 22:19.213
Tell me everything you know.

22:19.296 --> 22:21.340
- We found it.
- Where?

22:21.423 --> 22:24.844
I don't know, you're a
smart guy, you tell us.

22:24.927 --> 22:26.887
At first I thought, "Looks familiar."

22:26.971 --> 22:30.140
Bioluminescent organisms
have been around forever,

22:30.224 --> 22:34.144
but then this shit broke my calorimeter.

22:34.228 --> 22:36.814
Do you have any idea how many
joules it takes to do that?

22:36.897 --> 22:39.316
- A ton?
- Try a fuck ton.

22:39.400 --> 22:43.070
Something like this can only
evolve under immense pressure.

22:43.153 --> 22:46.407
I'm talking hadopelagic pressure.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.325
I don't know what that means.

22:48.409 --> 22:51.745
Of course you fucking don't, nimrod.

22:51.829 --> 22:54.832
This is the bottom of the ocean,

22:54.915 --> 22:57.668
and this is where this shit lives.

22:57.751 --> 23:00.087
Now, how the fuck did you two yahoos

23:00.170 --> 23:02.923
get your hands on it
unless somehow you found

23:03.007 --> 23:06.635
the keys to the most advanced
submersible ever built,

23:06.719 --> 23:08.639
which I doubt very highly,
because you don't even

23:08.679 --> 23:11.140
seem to know what a centrifuge is.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.809
It spins.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.603
Morris.

23:15.686 --> 23:18.355
- The kombucha, please.
- Kombucha?

23:18.439 --> 23:20.691
Now if you thought store-bought kombucha

23:20.774 --> 23:24.028
tasted like shit, wait until you get

23:24.111 --> 23:27.781
your taste buds on my
homebrew, Mr. Pastman.

23:27.865 --> 23:29.116
You're gonna love it.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.786
You're not, which is why I laugh.

23:32.870 --> 23:34.663
It tastes like shit,
I already said that.

23:34.747 --> 23:35.789
Let's go!

23:35.873 --> 23:37.791
And thus, in many ways, the drug trade

23:37.875 --> 23:41.170
represents capitalism
in its purest form.

23:41.253 --> 23:42.338
Make sense?

23:42.421 --> 23:45.883
Nothing has ever made
more sense in my life.

23:45.966 --> 23:49.011
- I got to go tell Tiger.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy.

23:49.094 --> 23:51.680
You're not going anywhere.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.432
I'm not?

24:20.209 --> 24:21.502
No more, please!

24:21.585 --> 24:24.588
I can't take it,
it's too... it's too tart!

24:24.672 --> 24:25.839
Please, Tiger, what the fuck?

24:25.923 --> 24:28.926
All right, okay, everybody
stop horse-dicking around.

24:29.009 --> 24:30.511
Where can we get more of this fuel?

24:30.594 --> 24:33.347
Are you on fucking peyote, Tiger?

24:33.430 --> 24:37.685
- There is no more of this fuel.
- Fuck.

24:37.768 --> 24:39.168
I mean, if there was any more of it

24:39.228 --> 24:41.063
we wouldn't be here, would we?

24:41.146 --> 24:43.607
So tell me where the fuck you got it.

24:43.691 --> 24:46.068
Morris, 'buch him.

24:46.151 --> 24:48.112
No, no, wait, wait, it
came from a time machine!

24:48.195 --> 24:49.697
It came from a time machine, okay?

24:49.780 --> 24:51.490
Oh good, thank you.

24:51.573 --> 24:54.535
Great, now we know it
came from a time machine.

24:54.618 --> 24:56.120
Fantastic, I've always wanted one.

24:56.203 --> 24:58.998
Can you get another time machine?

24:59.081 --> 25:00.708
Because if you can't, you'll be drowning

25:00.791 --> 25:02.418
in lemon zinger momentarily.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.211
Morris, the zinger.

25:04.294 --> 25:06.964
Actually, we can get
another time machine.

25:07.047 --> 25:08.549
You've been a very helpful nerd.

25:08.632 --> 25:10.217
This was a great idea.

25:14.346 --> 25:15.431
Awesome.

25:21.186 --> 25:22.813
Hard enough for you?

25:24.959 --> 25:28.736
Oh, come on.
You call yourself an adversary?

25:28.819 --> 25:30.320
Let's do this!

25:37.453 --> 25:39.747
No!

25:44.793 --> 25:46.378
Get over...

25:46.462 --> 25:47.921
Yeah!

25:51.645 --> 25:53.269
Oh no, you don't!

25:58.514 --> 26:01.268
So long, suckers!

26:10.903 --> 26:12.780
Get off... Get...

26:12.863 --> 26:14.823
Fucker's got some fight
in him after all.

26:19.244 --> 26:20.684
- Should I jump in?
- No, no, no, no.

26:20.746 --> 26:22.956
I think he's got this.

26:23.040 --> 26:25.209
Yeah, rip his fucking throat out!

26:28.378 --> 26:30.464
Or at least try to rip
his fucking throat out.

26:33.300 --> 26:35.219
Let go, let go!

26:37.221 --> 26:39.765
Ow.

26:39.848 --> 26:41.767
- Okay.
- Ah!

26:43.602 --> 26:46.313
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

26:46.396 --> 26:47.856
All right.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.317
Where...

26:51.902 --> 26:54.321
Ah, I got it!

26:54.404 --> 26:57.157
Kicked his ass, woo!

26:57.241 --> 26:59.993
Yeah, it was the um, the saddest,
most boring fight

27:00.077 --> 27:02.246
I've ever seen, but you
did do it, Futterman.

27:02.329 --> 27:04.206
You're back on the team.

27:04.289 --> 27:05.707
I'm back on the team?

27:05.791 --> 27:08.502
Oh my god, thank you,
I will not let you down.

27:08.585 --> 27:10.337
I will... I'll do whatever you need.

27:10.420 --> 27:11.713
That is great news,
because we might need

27:11.797 --> 27:13.382
a human target for the next mission.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.801
- You'd be perfect.
- What?

27:15.884 --> 27:17.261
You heard what the
window-faced man said.

27:17.344 --> 27:19.888
We need another time machine.

27:19.972 --> 27:22.057
Biotics, Biotics have time machines.

27:22.140 --> 27:23.851
Yes, and we already know that
they're in the laboratory

27:23.934 --> 27:27.229
that you clean, so we
just have to catch one.

27:27.312 --> 27:29.690
- Okay.
- Great fucking plan!

27:29.773 --> 27:32.526
Who's up for a charge down?

27:32.609 --> 27:35.737
I'll take either, or both.

27:55.841 --> 27:57.551
Hey, good news, old man.

27:57.634 --> 27:59.761
Sketch just came back of the perps.

27:59.845 --> 28:02.514
Let me see that.

28:06.059 --> 28:07.561
What do you think, Skarsgaard?

28:07.644 --> 28:09.646
Does that look like the
chick that punched you?

28:11.857 --> 28:15.944
You know what this sketch is missing?

28:16.028 --> 28:20.616
The corpse of my partner,
Jorge Santiago.

28:20.699 --> 28:23.702
His widow behind him weeping,

28:23.785 --> 28:28.290
belly swollen with child.

28:28.373 --> 28:31.418
Wow, really took the fun out of that.

28:31.501 --> 28:34.630
Come on, we've got Pastman,
we combed this place.

28:34.713 --> 28:37.633
Well, you better get a new comb.

28:37.716 --> 28:40.177
Shit, is that a purple hair?

28:40.260 --> 28:43.430
- Lucky break.
- Hey, you spend 48 years

28:43.513 --> 28:45.557
chasing every shadow and whisper,

28:45.641 --> 28:49.311
then talk to me about luck, punk.

28:49.394 --> 28:50.604
I'm going to run this through

28:50.687 --> 28:55.233
every DNA database in the world.

28:55.317 --> 28:56.860
Going to run every name

28:56.944 --> 29:00.072
that dealer gave us.

29:00.155 --> 29:03.700
Yeah, I'm coming for you.

29:05.869 --> 29:07.877
You and me.

29:07.970 --> 29:10.040
I'm coming for you.
