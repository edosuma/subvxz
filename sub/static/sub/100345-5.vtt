00:22.157 --> 00:25.117
- Your Holiness...
- Ms Stone, please...

00:25.611 --> 00:30.571
I will be eternally grateful if,
during the course of our conversation,

00:31.051 --> 00:34.971
you avoided the uncrossing
and re-crossing of your legs.

00:39.011 --> 00:40.051
Sure.

00:41.731 --> 00:43.371
What gift have you brought me ?

00:45.971 --> 00:49.211
I brought myself.
Isn't that enough ?

00:50.051 --> 00:51.731
It would have been,

00:51.811 --> 00:55.131
had you only promised
to stay here for the rest of your life.

00:55.531 --> 00:57.171
But I fear you will depart,

00:57.891 --> 01:01.291
and I will be left
with no tangible memory of you.

01:02.131 --> 01:03.131
Well...

01:49.451 --> 01:51.211
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:51.451 --> 01:55.491
I shall have those place
in a most special reliquary.

02:03.091 --> 02:07.291
You have beautiful feet,
however, they are rather large.

02:11.811 --> 02:15.931
My only defect. Do you have
any defects, Holy Father ?

02:16.051 --> 02:19.571
I am the defect.
I am defectus.

02:20.371 --> 02:23.091
Defectus, in Latin, means missing.

02:24.171 --> 02:25.451
I have missed myself.

02:27.891 --> 02:30.451
Do you know the cure for that ?
Family.

02:31.331 --> 02:33.131
I find that children
fill that avoid.

02:35.611 --> 02:41.291
I'm sure you realize for me that's
not particularly practical advise.

02:41.891 --> 02:43.531
You could drop that soutane.

02:46.851 --> 02:50.171
By the way, I am very honored
to meet you, Your Holiness.

02:51.251 --> 02:55.731
And I haven't just come here
out of some human curiosity.

02:55.851 --> 02:58.851
- I do have a plea.
- I'm delighted to hear.

03:01.651 --> 03:03.331
Gay marriage for Catholics.

03:05.211 --> 03:07.851
When will this pointless taboo
be eliminated ?

03:08.411 --> 03:12.131
When the Church has a brave,
revolutionary, resolute pope.

03:12.251 --> 03:15.851
- Qualities none of which I possess.
- What a shame !

03:20.571 --> 03:23.931
Even though
homosexuality is not a sin,

03:24.411 --> 03:26.851
sexual acts
outside of marriage are.

03:27.531 --> 03:31.811
According to the Bible,
sex is intended solely for procreation,

03:31.891 --> 03:34.251
therefore between
a man and a woman.

03:35.651 --> 03:40.251
- Can't the Bible be upgraded ?
- At last, the Bible is not an iPhone.

03:41.891 --> 03:44.531
- Again, what a shame !
- Not at all.

03:44.811 --> 03:48.171
Anything that can be upgraded,
like an iPhone,

03:48.411 --> 03:52.651
ends up in the bin, only to be replaced
by a more expensive model.

03:54.011 --> 03:57.131
The Bible has endured
for a very long time,

03:58.051 --> 04:01.091
and its value has changed a little,
if at all.

04:03.211 --> 04:05.691
- Because it can't be upgraded.
- Exactly.

04:06.051 --> 04:09.091
I suppose it's not even
a matter of "upgrading".

04:09.331 --> 04:14.411
It's more a matter of somehow
bridging the enormous gap

04:14.651 --> 04:17.051
between the sacred and the sinful.

04:19.211 --> 04:23.171
Quite a long ladder is needed.
The ladder of time.

04:23.971 --> 04:27.731
By broaching this object, you and I
have already lessened that gap.

04:27.811 --> 04:31.331
It's a small step granted,
but a step nevertheless.

04:31.571 --> 04:33.931
And this is supposed
to make me feel better ?

04:34.291 --> 04:40.171
Yes, of course. I read that you have
an IQ of 154, a genius practically.

04:41.451 --> 04:43.531
There's nothing ordinary
about you.

04:43.611 --> 04:48.251
And geniuses know that life
evolves in spite of us.

04:48.491 --> 04:53.411
In spite of lawyers and artisans,
politicians and bricklayers,

04:53.611 --> 04:55.131
university professors,

04:57.291 --> 04:59.891
geniuses and popes.

05:04.211 --> 05:06.651
- Can I have a glass of water ?
- Of course you may.

05:07.731 --> 05:09.931
You may have a gin and tonic,
if you like.

05:11.771 --> 05:13.931
It's a little early
for a gin and tonic.

05:14.011 --> 05:16.411
It's never too early
for a gin and tonic.

05:18.571 --> 05:21.371
Cheers ! Allow me, if I may,

05:21.811 --> 05:26.251
to take advantage of your intellect
for some moments longer.

05:27.931 --> 05:31.971
Apart from allowing
people of the same sex to marry,

05:33.571 --> 05:37.291
what would you suggest
the Catholic Church could do

05:37.571 --> 05:40.211
in order to make itself
more eloquent ?

05:42.131 --> 05:43.211
Well...

05:46.651 --> 05:47.731
In the end,

05:50.171 --> 05:51.571
what will remain of you ?

05:52.531 --> 05:58.051
Beside a load of magnificent art,
commissioned by you,

05:58.131 --> 06:01.051
in the Renaissance period,
from all of the greatest artists.

06:01.531 --> 06:03.411
There are great artists now.

06:06.651 --> 06:07.811
But you ignore them.

06:10.611 --> 06:14.091
So life passes, art remains.

06:14.451 --> 06:20.451
Art passes too but a little more slowly
because art is more cunning.

06:25.571 --> 06:29.771
Holy Father, my adductor
longus muscle is falling asleep.

06:30.011 --> 06:34.211
- May I cross my legs the other way ?
- One moment if you would.

06:41.611 --> 06:42.651
Now you may.

06:46.091 --> 06:47.091
I done.

06:48.331 --> 06:50.771
There, you see ? We did it.

06:51.011 --> 06:54.491
Once again, hail-fellows,
we made the sacrifice.

06:54.811 --> 06:55.891
Do not despair.

06:57.411 --> 07:02.091
Someday we will all come to appreciate
the beauty of sacrifice.

07:03.331 --> 07:04.651
Though, not today.

08:53.971 --> 08:56.491
THE NEW POPE
Episode 5

10:08.411 --> 10:12.451
- So, what's the pope gonna do ?
- I don't know.

10:12.771 --> 10:14.931
- How are you, Voiello ?
- Nervous.

10:15.211 --> 10:17.211
That's not new, isn'it ?

10:17.611 --> 10:20.491
This caliph
is keeping me up at night.

10:20.571 --> 10:24.451
Whatever you decide,
my one word of advice is: prudence.

10:31.851 --> 10:33.011
Translate, please.

10:33.371 --> 10:37.811
The only principle unscrupulous
men like ourselves must adhere to is:

10:38.211 --> 10:42.051
"If you don't have proof,
you don't have proof !"

10:42.491 --> 10:43.931
I need some air.

10:44.371 --> 10:49.131
Seriously Voiello, now when
you can finally breathe easy.

10:49.491 --> 10:52.971
Up until yesterday, thanks
to your excessive sexual exploits,

10:53.051 --> 10:55.371
you were
the quintessential culprits.

10:55.451 --> 10:59.091
But now, after that despicable
attack in Lourdes,

10:59.171 --> 11:00.691
you've become victims.

11:00.771 --> 11:05.051
The wind is shifting, my friend.
You better fan it.

11:05.971 --> 11:09.131
- I hadn't thought of that.
- That's why I am here.

11:09.851 --> 11:12.851
I think of everything,
speaking of which,

11:13.571 --> 11:19.411
a mean old bird keeps squawking about
a Spalletta-Tomas Altbruck alliance.

11:20.331 --> 11:23.331
It is not a mean old bird.

11:24.371 --> 11:25.851
It is a splendid sparrow.

11:28.691 --> 11:30.131
I suspected that was you.

11:31.771 --> 11:34.851
I need to know what's behind it.

11:35.131 --> 11:39.091
How about that typical human
weakness also known as greed ?

11:40.131 --> 11:42.691
- They're going to crash and burn.
- So let them.

11:43.571 --> 11:47.611
Cause afterwards you'll be back
in the game, stronger than ever.

11:48.291 --> 11:53.731
I can't let the pope crash and burn.
The pope can't be compromised.

11:53.931 --> 11:56.411
- You asking for my help ?
- Not yet.

12:11.451 --> 12:12.531
How is the movie ?

12:27.371 --> 12:30.211
- What are you going to do ?
- One word comes to mind.

12:30.371 --> 12:34.171
To mine too,
one to be avoided at all cost:

12:34.971 --> 12:36.091
islamic.

12:38.811 --> 12:40.971
That's not the world
I was thinking of.

12:41.051 --> 12:43.531
If you find the right word,
in Lourdes,

12:43.651 --> 12:46.291
it would be a giant leap forward
for your papacy.

12:47.771 --> 12:51.931
A leap that would make
your authoritativeness unstoppable.

12:57.811 --> 12:59.411
I have great faith in you.

13:05.691 --> 13:08.771
It is the private number
to my apartment.

13:08.971 --> 13:11.251
Only Danny has it.
Danny, and now you.

13:12.571 --> 13:16.091
Phone, if you like,
whenever you want.

13:41.171 --> 13:44.851
Did you appoint my husband
head of the financial organization

13:44.931 --> 13:46.571
because you have faith in me ?

13:46.971 --> 13:47.971
No.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.771
So why him, of all people ?

13:54.611 --> 13:55.651
Nietzsche said:

13:55.731 --> 13:59.851
"The Christian's decision
to see the world as ugly and evil"

14:00.171 --> 14:02.571
"has made the world
ugly and evil."

14:04.451 --> 14:06.371
We shall go to Lourdes,

14:09.051 --> 14:14.211
I will speak and old Nietzsche
will have to change his mind.

15:25.141 --> 15:26.221
Mascara ?

15:29.741 --> 15:30.861
No.

15:46.061 --> 15:47.061
No.

15:54.261 --> 15:55.301
No.

16:01.421 --> 16:02.461
No !

16:06.021 --> 16:07.341
No !

16:14.581 --> 16:15.581
No !

16:19.461 --> 16:20.461
No !

16:27.701 --> 16:29.141
No !

16:36.261 --> 16:37.341
No !

16:40.581 --> 16:41.781
No !

16:45.221 --> 16:47.461
No !

16:50.101 --> 16:51.461
No !

16:53.341 --> 16:54.461
No !

16:58.861 --> 17:00.181
No !

17:01.341 --> 17:02.901
No !

17:06.461 --> 17:08.741
No !

18:12.061 --> 18:13.061
Adam !

18:15.541 --> 18:16.661
Adam !

18:17.661 --> 18:18.741
Adam !

18:20.261 --> 18:23.421
- Come on, let's go for a ride !
- I can't, I'm writing.

18:24.461 --> 18:25.461
You'll be sorry.

19:22.701 --> 19:27.021
Holy Father, the press is positively
enthusiastic about your "no".

19:28.061 --> 19:31.581
Even the usual faultfinders,
days later,

19:31.821 --> 19:33.901
continue to pray your greatness.

19:34.701 --> 19:35.821
Take a look at this !

19:39.781 --> 19:41.541
What do you think Voiello ?

19:41.661 --> 19:46.381
A spiritual and human synthesis
that has touched people's hearts.

19:46.981 --> 19:48.861
The media value is irrefutable.

19:50.661 --> 19:54.501
So in other words, no actual value.
Is that what you mean to say ?

19:55.221 --> 19:59.261
- To be brutally honest...
- You are always brutal, Voiello.

19:59.541 --> 20:03.941
To be brutally honest, Holy Father,
after that "no",

20:04.181 --> 20:09.661
it is quite reasonable to expect that
thought would translate into action.

20:10.221 --> 20:12.181
So, what is it you had me do ?

20:13.021 --> 20:16.701
Rally a papal army and march it off
to battle Islamic terrorism ?

20:17.541 --> 20:19.341
He's even more brutal than you.

20:19.621 --> 20:22.461
Of course not,
there are intermediary measures.

20:22.781 --> 20:26.901
Measures that would weaken
the success of that "no".

20:27.301 --> 20:31.541
I agree. "No" is a moral declaration
of the greatest significance.

20:32.941 --> 20:37.741
The pope produces symbols, the vulgar
act of explanation must fall to others.

20:38.821 --> 20:43.701
Voiello, you seem to be in the minority,
but that does not mean you are wrong.

20:44.541 --> 20:48.221
I have been in the minority all my life,
Your Holiness.

20:48.341 --> 20:53.861
I belong to such a small minority
that I am the only member.

20:54.981 --> 21:00.101
I will articulate my thinking during
the interview with Emory Kitsworth.

21:01.021 --> 21:02.941
Lourdes was not the place for that.

21:03.141 --> 21:07.341
What was needed there
was a spectacular emotional expression.

21:08.181 --> 21:13.301
However if it makes you happier
to refer to it as a slogan, go ahead.

21:13.821 --> 21:17.301
Exactly. When would you like
to do the interview, Holy Father ?

21:17.781 --> 21:20.141
Kitsworth is quivering
in anticipation.

21:20.581 --> 21:22.901
Not ready yet,
but I will let you know soon.

21:23.221 --> 21:27.701
Of course I must be fully prepared,
so is not to disappoint Voiello.

23:04.781 --> 23:05.981
Where are you going ?

23:08.141 --> 23:11.261
- To an informal meeting.
- It sounds sordid.

23:12.541 --> 23:13.661
It is.

23:57.581 --> 23:58.581
I can't.

24:01.501 --> 24:04.341
- Why not ?
- Because I can't anymore.

24:44.981 --> 24:46.181
I have news.

24:51.581 --> 24:53.061
I think I'm pregnant.

26:07.381 --> 26:08.381
Here I am.

26:09.581 --> 26:13.021
I was about to hang up.
I didn't think you were going to answer.

26:14.621 --> 26:18.341
I wanted you to believe your call
wasn't important to me.

26:20.741 --> 26:23.821
And instead ? Have you been
waiting for me to call ?

26:25.261 --> 26:26.341
My whole life.

26:28.541 --> 26:30.301
What are you doing this evening ?

26:33.301 --> 26:34.741
Don't misunderstand me !

26:39.941 --> 26:42.901
A highly unusual choice
for a first date, Holy Father.

26:44.421 --> 26:49.261
The catacombs are the closest thing
to a nightclub a priest has.

26:50.421 --> 26:52.221
So are we looking
for the bar now ?

26:53.341 --> 26:57.941
Not exactly.
The tomb of Francis II.

26:59.581 --> 27:02.941
I thought appropriate
I pay him a visit as well.

27:06.101 --> 27:07.701
- Shall we pray ?
- Yes.

27:27.781 --> 27:33.181
Do you also find Francis II's death
mysterious and inexplicable ?

27:33.421 --> 27:36.861
No. I believe the official line:
cardiac arrest.

27:37.581 --> 27:40.061
You know you may be
the only one who does ?

27:40.621 --> 27:45.461
I know. I also know that the usual
rumors are circulating about Voiello.

27:45.701 --> 27:48.941
- Yet you pay them no heed.
- No, I don't.

27:49.541 --> 27:53.221
For years now, Voiello has been the
scapegoat for everything in the Vatican.

27:53.821 --> 27:55.221
And you admire Voiello.

27:56.861 --> 28:00.061
We work well together.
We're both good chess players,

28:00.421 --> 28:03.341
even though we've never even seen
a chess board in our lives.

28:04.341 --> 28:08.461
- Are there conspiracies about me ?
- Not as far as I know.

28:09.021 --> 28:13.701
Only persistent questions, which are
the premise for a great deal of gossip.

28:14.141 --> 28:15.221
Do tell.

28:15.661 --> 28:19.181
People are asking:
is this pope porcelain or steel ?

28:20.101 --> 28:22.581
Why not something in between:
fiberglass ?

28:25.301 --> 28:28.621
- And then there is that eternal refrain.
- Which is ?

28:30.541 --> 28:32.541
Is he gay or straight ?

28:34.861 --> 28:39.101
- Now, I'll tell you a bit of gossip.
- Please do.

28:40.461 --> 28:43.981
In the conclave,
Lenny Belardo received one vote.

28:44.701 --> 28:48.261
I know that. It's all anyone
has been talking about for days.

28:48.541 --> 28:51.021
But what you do not know
is who cast that vote.

28:51.821 --> 28:54.341
No. No one ever figured it out.

28:55.781 --> 28:56.861
That was my vote.

29:02.141 --> 29:03.141
Why ?

29:05.301 --> 29:07.061
Because God does not like me.

29:16.901 --> 29:19.981
- Do you know why I became a priest ?
- No.

29:21.221 --> 29:25.621
Because religion
is a narrative story that is told,

29:25.701 --> 29:27.741
an incredibly successful story.

29:28.541 --> 29:32.861
Seeing that God is the most popular
protagonist in history.

29:33.781 --> 29:37.861
I would never have been satisfied
devoting my life

29:37.941 --> 29:43.221
to minor narratives as I found
in literature, film, music.

29:43.621 --> 29:47.221
Those at best
can only be enjoyable pastimes.

29:47.741 --> 29:51.221
And what is that interests you most
in the religious narrative ?

29:51.941 --> 29:56.741
The incessant inquiry
into the greatest mystery of all:

29:57.581 --> 29:58.901
the nature of man.

29:59.461 --> 30:03.461
Hence the clergy's incessant question:
gay or straight ?

30:04.861 --> 30:08.781
I shall only say that I was a punk
when I was young.

30:10.901 --> 30:13.381
That seems to me
far more interesting.

30:15.701 --> 30:18.941
We have to set a date
for that interview.

30:20.541 --> 30:24.061
I know now
what I want to say to Kitsworth.

30:24.821 --> 30:27.941
If I'm not being indiscreet,
could I at least ask you

30:28.021 --> 30:30.181
what subject you would discuss
with Kitsworth ?

30:31.581 --> 30:36.541
That man cannot be changed,
but he can be diverted.

30:38.541 --> 30:42.301
I'm not all that sure, Your Holiness,
what the subject would be.

30:43.861 --> 30:48.541
Pedophilia among the clergy
and all the sexual abuse.

30:48.661 --> 30:51.341
That is the issue
that matters most to me.

30:51.901 --> 30:55.061
For, if we forgive them,
they will do it again

30:55.861 --> 31:00.221
and if we punish them,
we are not practicing Christian charity.

31:00.501 --> 31:04.141
- But is there another way ?
- There is always another way.

31:04.901 --> 31:07.861
And I believe I was called
to the papacy to chart it.

31:12.981 --> 31:16.021
Sick loves cannot be treated, Sofia.

31:17.301 --> 31:20.381
You can treat cancer,
but not love.

31:21.981 --> 31:26.701
One possibility, then,
is to shift the object of love.

31:27.541 --> 31:30.461
How do you do that ? Tell me !

31:35.701 --> 31:40.661
During the interview, I am going
to make an extraordinary overture:

31:41.461 --> 31:46.221
I intend to state that I am in favor
of marriage for priests,

31:46.301 --> 31:47.741
both gay and straight.

31:48.101 --> 31:51.181
We have to legitimize "possible" love,

31:51.861 --> 31:55.701
so as to divert people
from "aberrant" love,

31:56.461 --> 31:58.501
which is a form of violence.

31:58.701 --> 32:04.181
I am not so naive
as to think that this is the solution.

32:04.261 --> 32:09.021
But as a way of limiting the damage,
it could well work.

32:09.941 --> 32:13.101
Holy Father,
you're proposing to upgrade the Bible.

32:14.061 --> 32:15.461
As if it were an iPhone !

32:17.181 --> 32:20.461
You are an intelligent
and tireless worker, Sofia.

32:20.661 --> 32:23.981
Could you not come up
with a more suitable metaphor, please ?

32:25.501 --> 32:29.741
I will. An announcement
of this sort is a giant leap.

32:33.461 --> 32:34.661
A small step

32:35.301 --> 32:40.541
and hopefully less tears
in the great ocean of human history.

32:42.461 --> 32:45.501
This will be a bomb.
A genuine bomb.

32:48.101 --> 32:51.381
No. This is the middle way.

34:01.339 --> 34:02.739
It's 1 100 euro.

34:04.019 --> 34:07.699
100 for Don Mario,
and 1 000 for Attanasio.

35:39.139 --> 35:41.579
And now,
a word to our listeners.

35:42.419 --> 35:46.739
We at Radio 103 have decided
to alter our programming.

35:47.219 --> 35:50.579
As of today, no more music,
no more entertainment.

35:51.179 --> 35:55.699
We will be broadcasting one thing only:
Pope Pius XIII's breathing.

35:56.659 --> 35:58.859
Live, from the intensive cure unity

35:58.979 --> 36:01.419
of San Giovanni e Paolo Hospital
in Venice.

39:41.099 --> 39:43.939
And this is the fact
that no doctor is able to explain.

39:44.059 --> 39:47.339
After 415 breaths,
the pope let out a sigh.

39:47.819 --> 39:51.259
Then, 414 breaths,
followed by another sigh.

39:51.779 --> 39:55.579
So now we are expecting
413 breaths and then a sigh.

39:56.219 --> 39:57.459
What does it all mean ?

41:57.379 --> 42:01.859
He has come back !
Pius XIII is back !

43:08.659 --> 43:10.819
Turn off that radio, please !

43:18.419 --> 43:21.259
All this fanfare
over Lenny Belardo's breathing

43:21.339 --> 43:23.699
has made quite an impression
on the masses.

43:24.379 --> 43:28.899
The increase in the idolatry
of Pius the XIIIth will be immediate.

43:31.259 --> 43:33.779
That interview with Kitsworth

43:33.979 --> 43:36.659
is indispensable
to refocus attention on you.

43:36.939 --> 43:37.939
Not yet.

43:42.619 --> 43:46.179
How many breaths now,
before he gives a sigh ?

43:47.305 --> 43:53.891
