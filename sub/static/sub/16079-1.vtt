1:33:37.738 --> 1:33:40.571
Oh. I didn't see you come up.

1:33:40.574 --> 1:33:43.532
That's 'cause you keep
looking behind you.

1:33:47.706 --> 1:33:49.992
Perhaps you'd be interested
in a little ration

1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:51.740
of Madame Louise's Cure All.

1:33:59.635 --> 1:34:03.969
Course, some say it's the demon rum
in a fancy bottle.

1:34:05.682 --> 1:34:07.422
But it'll cure what ails you.

1:34:11.230 --> 1:34:13.391
Well, thank you kindly.

1:34:14.733 --> 1:34:19.602
But I'm afraid ain't no bottle
going to sort out my troubles.

1:34:19.613 --> 1:34:21.604
You men.

1:34:21.615 --> 1:34:24.527
You're always choosing a gun
over a remedy.

1:34:24.535 --> 1:34:26.867
It don't really much matter
what I choose.

1:34:29.122 --> 1:34:30.862
Got no money, either way.

1:34:30.874 --> 1:34:35.208
Oh, hell. I never let that
stand in the way of making a deal.

1:34:38.382 --> 1:34:40.338
What's wrong with that .44?

1:34:40.342 --> 1:34:41.878
Nothing.

1:34:42.970 --> 1:34:44.710
How old's the animal?

1:34:46.890 --> 1:34:48.551
I don't really know.

1:34:48.559 --> 1:34:50.095
Steal her, did you?

1:34:51.562 --> 1:34:53.223
Not exactly.
[Chuckles]

1:34:53.230 --> 1:34:55.596
Spoken like a true sinner.

1:34:55.607 --> 1:34:59.316
Well, hell,
don't matter much out here.

1:34:59.319 --> 1:35:02.061
Man's got to do
what a man's got to do, right?

1:35:03.740 --> 1:35:05.276
Yeah.

1:35:08.787 --> 1:35:10.743
I suppose we'd best fix you up.

1:35:14.501 --> 1:35:16.037
Cost you the horse.

1:35:23.635 --> 1:35:25.216
Well...

1:35:27.139 --> 1:35:29.551
..I reckon I ain't
getting out of here anyway.

1:35:29.558 --> 1:35:33.267
Hell, I'll even throw in
a bottle of the curative.

1:35:34.438 --> 1:35:35.974
Huh.

1:35:50.704 --> 1:35:52.990
Hey!

1:35:52.998 --> 1:35:54.863
Don't forget your curative.

1:35:58.378 --> 1:36:00.460
[LIQUID HISSES]

1:36:45.217 --> 1:36:46.753
[Grunts]

1:37:38.603 --> 1:37:41.640
Look at that sun long enough,
you'll go blind.

1:37:44.568 --> 1:37:46.934
Or worse.

1:37:46.945 --> 1:37:48.481
Mad.

1:37:53.785 --> 1:37:57.073
What the hell you want?
I'm just a humble pedlar.

1:37:57.080 --> 1:37:59.366
Offering a cure to an ailing world.

1:37:59.374 --> 1:38:01.831
I ain't looking for no cure.

1:38:01.835 --> 1:38:03.746
Why, that's just what
your friend said.

1:38:03.754 --> 1:38:05.790
That what he's calling himself?

1:38:05.797 --> 1:38:07.333
What would you call him?

1:38:09.551 --> 1:38:13.043
Somebody who could use a taste
of that Colt of yours.

1:38:16.808 --> 1:38:18.344
Tell you what, stranger.

1:38:20.771 --> 1:38:24.389
I've got three thirsty animals
over there.

1:38:24.399 --> 1:38:26.890
I'll trade you this here steel...

1:38:27.986 --> 1:38:29.726
..for that water you've got.

1:38:52.302 --> 1:38:53.838
What do you say?

1:38:55.597 --> 1:38:57.133
Got us a deal?

1:38:58.767 --> 1:39:00.758
Yeah.

1:39:00.769 --> 1:39:02.305
[Examines gun]

1:39:04.648 --> 1:39:06.559
Just the one shell.
[Chuckles]

1:39:06.566 --> 1:39:08.306
You looking for more?

1:39:12.489 --> 1:39:14.025
I reckon not.

1:39:33.635 --> 1:39:35.171
[Sighs]

1:40:17.179 --> 1:40:18.715
[Sighs]

1:40:28.190 --> 1:40:32.183
Time was...
you said your war was over.

1:40:32.194 --> 1:40:35.402
Only the dead
know the end of war, Cap'n.

1:40:51.546 --> 1:40:53.082
[Groans]

1:41:12.317 --> 1:41:14.854
Go on.

1:41:14.861 --> 1:41:16.397
Finish it.

1:41:45.809 --> 1:41:47.720
I believe it's up to you, sir.

1:42:12.252 --> 1:42:13.788
Rose.

1:42:17.382 --> 1:42:18.918
Rose.

1:42:28.643 --> 1:42:30.179
Forgive me.
