03:33.079 --> 03:34.490
Say...

03:35.815 --> 03:38.557
what's the directions you got
to McDermott?

03:38.584 --> 03:40.689
Just go straight down here...

03:40.720 --> 03:44.566
hang a left, catch highway 30,
and take it all the way out.

03:44.590 --> 03:45.898
Straight on out,
and you can't miss it.

03:45.925 --> 03:47.734
OK. Thanks a lot.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.565
Get your ass out of here, lady!

03:52.598 --> 03:55.306
You fool! imbecile!

03:55.334 --> 03:56.836
And take these with you!

03:56.869 --> 03:58.041
Damn it!

03:59.605 --> 04:01.846
You son of a bitch!

04:01.874 --> 04:03.911
I hope you run into a truck!

04:03.943 --> 04:07.254
What's more,
you got lousy taste in music!

04:16.154 --> 04:17.498
Are you going to be all right?

04:17.523 --> 04:18.661
What do you want?

04:18.690 --> 04:19.999
I saw you get thrown out
of that van.

04:20.026 --> 04:21.767
You landed kind of hard.
Are you sure you're OK?

04:21.793 --> 04:23.899
Rotate out of here, Jack!

04:23.930 --> 04:26.604
If you say so.

04:49.822 --> 04:52.393
- Hey, you-Ace.
-The name's Harkin.

04:52.425 --> 04:55.406
Excuse me, Harkin.
Where are you headed?

04:55.428 --> 04:57.374
West. How about you?

04:57.396 --> 04:58.704
San Francisco.

05:00.032 --> 05:02.603
- Want a ride?
-Sure.

05:04.937 --> 05:06.075
Here.

05:06.105 --> 05:08.312
I can handle it.

05:08.341 --> 05:11.345
You ain't
some kind of a weirdo, are you?

05:11.377 --> 05:14.221
I don't think so.

05:14.246 --> 05:16.192
- What's your name?
-Sunny.

05:16.215 --> 05:18.786
How come that guy threw you
out of there like that?

05:18.818 --> 05:20.354
Well, what do you think?

05:20.386 --> 05:22.024
I don't know.
That's why I asked.

05:22.054 --> 05:25.092
I ain't going down on a guy
at sixty-five miles an hour...

05:25.124 --> 05:27.229
just for a crummy ride.

05:45.277 --> 05:47.314
You got something besides this?

05:47.346 --> 05:49.724
I'm tired of this.

05:49.749 --> 05:51.387
Oh, you don't like country?

05:51.417 --> 05:54.023
Why don't you try
something different, OK?

05:54.053 --> 05:55.657
Just pop it in.

06:00.259 --> 06:02.398
Now, this I can handle.

06:09.969 --> 06:12.210
So, why you got four pairs
of skis back there?

06:12.238 --> 06:14.411
I'm skiing
the world championships...

06:14.440 --> 06:15.817
freestyle at Squaw Valley.

06:15.841 --> 06:19.721
I got one for bumps,
one for aerials.

06:19.745 --> 06:21.019
The little short ones there
are for ballet...

06:21.047 --> 06:23.357
and one's for just plain speed.

06:23.382 --> 06:26.556
Speed?
I could use some of that.

06:34.694 --> 06:36.037
You got a girlfriend, Ace?

06:36.062 --> 06:38.872
I used to,
but I spent all my time skiing.

06:38.898 --> 06:40.900
She got tired
of being number two.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.775
Hey, how old are you?

06:44.804 --> 06:46.477
Eighteen, in April.

06:48.174 --> 06:50.620
Ran away from home, right?

06:50.643 --> 06:53.852
Wrong. You got to have a home
to run away from.

07:13.232 --> 07:15.075
What?

07:15.101 --> 07:17.581
I'm getting a room
for the night.

07:17.603 --> 07:20.880
Hey, buddy, you figure you can
get in my pants this way.

07:20.906 --> 07:24.718
I--I ain't figuring nothing.

07:24.744 --> 07:27.054
Do you want to spend the night
out here in the truck?

07:28.614 --> 07:30.218
It's OK by me.

07:48.701 --> 07:50.874
Hey, Harky, you got something
I can wear to bed?

07:50.903 --> 07:53.247
My mother forgot
to pack my pajamas.

07:54.940 --> 07:56.544
Thank you.

07:56.575 --> 07:58.316
You know
there's only one bed in here.

07:58.344 --> 08:01.382
So?
Pick a side and stay there.

08:53.566 --> 08:56.376
So, how come you didn't
try nothing last night?

08:58.571 --> 09:00.073
I was tired.

09:02.107 --> 09:04.849
You didn't exactly
invite me, anyway.

09:04.877 --> 09:06.049
Are you for real?

09:10.349 --> 09:12.295
Are you a virgin?

09:14.520 --> 09:16.056
Are you?

09:18.858 --> 09:22.203
Well,
you had your chance, fella.

09:22.228 --> 09:25.402
I ain't half bad, you know.

09:26.732 --> 09:29.713
So, what happens
in Squaw Valley besides skiing?

09:29.735 --> 09:31.510
Beats me. I never been there.

09:31.537 --> 09:33.210
You see,
I don't really have to be...

09:33.239 --> 09:34.684
in San Francisco for a while...

09:34.707 --> 09:37.017
and, well, maybe do you
just think I could--

09:37.042 --> 09:38.680
Want to tag along?

09:38.711 --> 09:40.520
Yeah. Why not?

09:40.546 --> 09:42.856
OK, but no funny stuff.

09:42.882 --> 09:45.226
I don't put out for everyone
I pick up.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.422
Anybody home?

10:45.277 --> 10:46.950
Damn it.

10:51.216 --> 10:54.254
Someone's at the front desk.

10:54.286 --> 10:55.788
I'll be right back.

11:12.571 --> 11:14.482
Checking in?

11:14.506 --> 11:17.248
Yeah. Banks, Harkin.

11:17.276 --> 11:19.017
Freestyler?

11:21.947 --> 11:24.689
It's the last room we had.
I was getting worried about you.

11:24.717 --> 11:26.697
I'll bet.

11:26.719 --> 11:28.790
Welcome to Squaw.

11:28.821 --> 11:30.664
And call me
if you need anything.

11:30.689 --> 11:34.193
Yeah, could you wash
our truck for us?

11:34.226 --> 11:35.569
First thing in the morning.

11:35.594 --> 11:38.598
Thanks. Come on, Harkin.

11:48.874 --> 11:51.252
Wow! Get a load of this!

11:51.276 --> 11:53.483
I can't believe it.

11:53.512 --> 11:56.584
This looks like a cathouse.

11:56.615 --> 11:59.118
Whoa! This is great!

12:01.186 --> 12:04.565
And you were going
to stay here alone?

12:04.590 --> 12:06.501
It was the only place
I could get.

12:12.197 --> 12:15.576
Hey, Harkin, check this out.

12:19.171 --> 12:20.912
How does it work?

12:20.939 --> 12:23.818
I don't know. I think it's got
some jets or something...

12:23.842 --> 12:25.981
that forces the water up.

12:26.011 --> 12:27.888
A friend of mine stayed
in a place like this once...

12:27.913 --> 12:30.587
but it was only for an hour.

12:57.009 --> 12:58.352
Oh, don't stop!

12:58.377 --> 13:00.550
- Oh, that feels good!
-I want more!

13:00.579 --> 13:02.081
- Oh, do it!
-You like that, huh?

13:02.114 --> 13:04.754
Yes, I do! Oh, I want more!

13:04.783 --> 13:05.955
Touch me!

13:07.152 --> 13:08.893
What do you say
we get something to eat?

13:15.894 --> 13:18.397
Want to try these on?

13:18.430 --> 13:20.034
Don't you like the way I dress?

13:20.065 --> 13:22.067
I thought you might
look nice in them.

13:28.107 --> 13:30.109
Am I gonna have
to wash dishes, Ace?

13:30.142 --> 13:32.816
Un-uh. It's my treat.

13:32.845 --> 13:34.552
Well, how can you afford
all of this?

13:34.580 --> 13:37.993
The room, the food,
this sweater?

13:38.016 --> 13:39.427
Well, my ma knit the sweater...

13:39.451 --> 13:42.398
and I've been working all summer
for the money to make this trip.

13:42.421 --> 13:44.560
I milked forty head of cattle
twice a day.

13:46.258 --> 13:49.432
Whoa! Get a load of him.

13:50.662 --> 13:55.236
- Oh, my God!
-You know him?

13:55.267 --> 13:57.338
That's Rudolf Garmischt!

14:00.472 --> 14:02.816
He won the gold medal
in Lake Placid in 1930...

14:02.841 --> 14:06.254
and he's the world freestyle
champ the last 2 years running.

14:06.278 --> 14:08.189
Damn sexy, too.

14:08.213 --> 14:10.523
He's the best...

14:10.549 --> 14:13.223
the world's greatest skier.

14:20.192 --> 14:21.535
Mr. Garmischt?

14:27.466 --> 14:28.638
I think you're the greatest.

14:32.471 --> 14:35.281
So ein stupide Amerikaner.

14:38.443 --> 14:41.720
Hey, Adolf!
Somebody's talking to you!

14:47.052 --> 14:49.191
That will work in Europe, yeah?

14:49.221 --> 14:55.001
There, the women are beautiful,
but also intelligent.

14:55.027 --> 14:57.633
Rotate on this,
you nazi bastard!

14:59.965 --> 15:03.139
Nice coat. Uh...rat?

15:05.103 --> 15:07.640
You shouldn't have done that!
That was Rudolf Garmischt!

15:07.673 --> 15:08.981
He's a jerk!

15:12.211 --> 15:14.191
Always has been.

15:14.213 --> 15:16.716
Greetings. Dan O'Callahan.

15:16.748 --> 15:18.659
I've seen you
in all the ski magazines.

15:18.684 --> 15:20.527
Dan here used to be
one of the best.

15:20.552 --> 15:24.159
I still am.
What's your name?

15:24.189 --> 15:26.032
I'm Harkin Banks. This is Sunny.

15:26.058 --> 15:29.096
I came here to compete--
if I qualify.

15:29.127 --> 15:32.597
You got to be pretty good
to make it on this circuit, kid.

15:34.566 --> 15:36.842
You here to qualify, too?

15:36.868 --> 15:39.712
- I ain't into skiing.
-Well, that's no problem.

15:39.738 --> 15:41.581
Plenty of things to do here.

15:43.308 --> 15:46.551
So, you met Rudi, huh?

15:46.578 --> 15:50.651
Well, he might be a great skier,
but he's a world-class asshole.

15:54.052 --> 15:56.726
Well, see you on the mountain,
huh, kid?

15:56.755 --> 15:58.496
Yeah, I'll be there.

15:58.523 --> 15:59.695
Pleasure.

16:03.262 --> 16:06.038
That guy wants
to get into my pants.

16:06.064 --> 16:07.668
What?

16:07.699 --> 16:08.939
He's got
another thing coming...

16:08.967 --> 16:11.004
if he thinks
he's gonna make it with me.

16:11.036 --> 16:13.038
I ain't into older men,
you know?

16:14.840 --> 16:16.319
Where did you get
all this stuff?

16:18.043 --> 16:19.351
Watch out, watch out.

16:27.386 --> 16:29.957
Hey, watch it, buddy!
You jerk!

16:29.988 --> 16:31.592
Come on, Ace,
I'll buy you a drink.

16:31.623 --> 16:32.795
You got it.

16:41.066 --> 16:46.038
All right!
Nice hand for The Breakers!

16:46.071 --> 16:48.551
OK, get down here 'cause
you know what time it is?

16:48.573 --> 16:50.575
Wet T-shirt contest time!

16:52.010 --> 16:53.489
I'm Lester the Molester...

16:53.512 --> 16:55.788
and I run the baddest, meanest
wet T-shirt contest there is!

16:55.814 --> 16:58.590
But what do you need
to have a wet T-shirt contest?

16:58.617 --> 17:01.461
Yeah, girls!
Let's get some girls up here!

17:01.486 --> 17:03.329
Come on,
give me some girls up here!

17:03.355 --> 17:05.300
All right!

17:16.568 --> 17:19.013
We need more girls than this,
though, don't we?

17:19.037 --> 17:20.516
More!

17:20.539 --> 17:22.040
Yes, we do,
but in order to find girls...

17:22.074 --> 17:24.611
I gotta get out my girlfinder!

17:33.385 --> 17:37.231
Now, let's go for the girls!
Where are you, girls? Come on!

17:37.255 --> 17:39.201
Better close this up--
don't want anybody to get hurt.

17:39.224 --> 17:41.295
Hold this for me back there,
would you, darling?

17:41.326 --> 17:43.499
Let's find some more girls.

17:43.528 --> 17:45.337
How about this girl over here?

17:45.364 --> 17:47.970
How about you, honey?
You want to get up here?

17:47.999 --> 17:49.410
Hey, guys,
let's get that girl up here.

17:49.434 --> 17:51.038
Oh, she's covering up.

17:51.069 --> 17:52.707
Let's go into the back here.
How about that girl?

17:52.738 --> 17:55.116
Guys, get her up here!
Come on! Bring her up here!

17:55.140 --> 17:57.620
- I got fifty bucks on you.
-No way!

17:57.642 --> 18:00.145
Come on, baby! Let's go!

18:01.813 --> 18:04.726
Oh, my lord!

18:04.750 --> 18:06.229
How do you do, darling?
I'm new in town...

18:06.251 --> 18:08.527
and I don't know
how to get to your house.

18:09.855 --> 18:11.061
How about you, honey?

18:11.089 --> 18:12.432
You look like you're
in the mood for a contest.

18:12.457 --> 18:14.198
The guys are all
pulling for you.

18:14.226 --> 18:16.263
You would be great in this!

18:16.294 --> 18:18.001
I say, what do you say?

18:18.029 --> 18:20.339
All right, all right!

18:20.365 --> 18:21.776
Come on up here. Yeah.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.939
OK, come on,
we need some more girls!

18:23.969 --> 18:28.247
How about this girl back here?
Come on up here!

18:28.273 --> 18:32.346
Yeah! Yeah! Come on up here!
Another volunteer!

18:32.377 --> 18:36.223
Put me down! Come on,
put me down! Put me down!

18:36.248 --> 18:39.024
How about this for a volunteer?

18:39.050 --> 18:40.586
All right!

18:42.421 --> 18:44.628
Let's see them titties!

18:52.831 --> 18:56.108
You guys thought you'd have
seltzer bottles...

18:56.134 --> 18:58.205
but I'm the one
who gets to do it.

18:58.236 --> 18:59.544
Aw, this is great fun!

18:59.571 --> 19:02.279
It's water time.
Get me a volunteer!

19:41.346 --> 19:43.485
Take it off! Take it off!

20:25.023 --> 20:26.730
Come on, wake up!

21:12.604 --> 21:15.448
Oh once

21:15.473 --> 21:17.851
We were dreamers on the rise

21:17.876 --> 21:20.982
We were the sun

21:21.012 --> 21:23.754
Where the sun never shines

21:23.782 --> 21:25.352
And we were gold

21:26.651 --> 21:31.031
Where the nightbird only flies

21:31.056 --> 21:34.162
That's a long time, you know

21:34.192 --> 21:38.163
For that kind of wind to blow

21:38.196 --> 21:40.472
Long time ago

21:40.498 --> 21:45.447
We were dreamers on the rise

21:45.470 --> 21:46.915
Entwined

21:47.906 --> 21:50.409
We said we'd begin again

21:50.442 --> 21:52.718
And we made a vow

21:54.079 --> 21:56.081
That we'd remain as friends

21:56.114 --> 21:58.856
And we'd fallen down

21:58.883 --> 22:03.298
We said we shall rise again

22:03.321 --> 22:05.665
That's a long time, you know

22:05.690 --> 22:09.365
For that kind of wind to blow

22:10.729 --> 22:12.868
Long time ago

22:12.897 --> 22:16.538
We were dreamers on the mend

22:16.568 --> 22:18.809
Long time ago

22:18.837 --> 22:23.047
We were dreamers on the mend

22:23.074 --> 22:25.179
And if three

22:25.210 --> 22:28.214
Wishes came into my life

22:28.246 --> 22:31.227
I'd say one

22:31.249 --> 22:33.627
Was to gaze into your eyes

22:33.652 --> 22:36.792
And I'd say two

22:36.821 --> 22:40.633
Would be turning back our lives

22:40.659 --> 22:43.936
Three's a long way to go

22:43.962 --> 22:46.943
For that kind of wind to blow

22:48.500 --> 22:50.980
Long time ago

22:51.002 --> 22:53.846
We were dreamers on the rise

22:53.872 --> 22:56.478
Long time ago

22:56.508 --> 22:59.682
We were dreamers on the rise

22:59.711 --> 23:02.191
Long time ago

23:02.213 --> 23:05.422
We were dreamers

23:05.450 --> 23:10.365
On the rise

23:13.658 --> 23:15.695
You play well.

23:15.727 --> 23:19.334
Thanks. I wrote it myself.

23:19.364 --> 23:21.970
You got more going for you
than skiing any day.

23:22.000 --> 23:27.348
Yeah? My sister says that
I'm as good as John Denver.

23:27.372 --> 23:29.682
She's not all wrong, Ace.

23:29.708 --> 23:32.712
Yeah, well, she's just a kid.

23:37.816 --> 23:40.319
Well, long day tomorrow.

23:40.351 --> 23:42.592
I guess I'd better be
hitting the hay.

24:14.552 --> 24:16.691
Mind if I join you?

24:16.721 --> 24:18.098
Sure.

24:30.635 --> 24:33.138
You son of a bitch!

24:33.171 --> 24:35.913
You're not gonna fall asleep
on me two nights in a row!

25:27.392 --> 25:29.338
Whoo! All right!

25:29.360 --> 25:31.067
Nice turns!

25:31.095 --> 25:33.006
Squirrel, look at this kid!

25:48.610 --> 25:52.888
Yeah, the boy is good,
but I wouldn't worry about it.

26:10.699 --> 26:13.373
Aspirin, drinky!

26:18.206 --> 26:21.187
Hey, Dan! How you doing?

26:21.209 --> 26:23.712
Not so loud, huh, kid?

26:23.745 --> 26:26.055
I was up all night
doing a crossword puzzle.

26:27.382 --> 26:28.622
You want a sip?

26:32.220 --> 26:33.528
A strike!

26:33.555 --> 26:37.025
Hey, listen, kid, I saw your
qualifying run this morning.

26:37.059 --> 26:39.699
- Not bad.
-Thanks. When are you running?

26:39.728 --> 26:42.072
Oh, well, us vets--
we did it yesterday.

26:42.097 --> 26:43.940
They don't post the results
till tonight...

26:43.965 --> 26:45.740
so we're just gonna go out
and boogie, you know?

26:45.767 --> 26:47.940
Just clean out the system.

26:47.969 --> 26:51.883
Well, Harkin Banks,
I want you to meet the Rat Pack.

26:51.907 --> 26:53.215
This is Squirrel Murphy.

26:53.241 --> 26:55.050
Yeah, best run
of the morning, man!

26:55.077 --> 26:56.852
What, were you
on 'shrooms or what?

26:56.878 --> 26:59.916
He's a little crazier
than he looks. Come on.

26:59.948 --> 27:03.395
Oh, and that's Kendo.

27:09.491 --> 27:11.493
He's got a way with words, huh?

27:11.526 --> 27:12.698
We call him Kamikaze.

27:12.727 --> 27:15.003
When you see him ski,
you'll know why.

27:15.030 --> 27:17.670
Oh, and that's Fergy,
the motormouth-shut up.

27:17.699 --> 27:19.178
And then Banana Pants.

27:19.201 --> 27:22.182
You can call her Michelle.
She's taken.

27:22.204 --> 27:23.342
I am?

27:23.371 --> 27:25.510
Cute, huh? Oh, and Slasher.

27:25.540 --> 27:27.542
Slasher. Slasher.

27:27.576 --> 27:30.580
Say hi to Harkin Banks.

27:30.612 --> 27:32.091
Hey, Harkin.

27:32.114 --> 27:35.118
Good, huh? Well, Harkin here
is gonna put the fear of God...

27:35.150 --> 27:37.630
into Rudi Kazooti Garmischt.

27:45.327 --> 27:48.365
He asked if you want to ski
with us this afternoon.

27:48.396 --> 27:50.535
We're gonna hit
some radical terrain--

27:50.565 --> 27:54.445
Avalanche City, Outta Bounds,
Squirrel Mountain.

27:54.469 --> 27:56.312
Hey, sounds great.

27:56.338 --> 27:57.874
Well, then
let's climb aboard...

27:57.906 --> 28:00.443
in an orderly fashion--
spread out!

28:19.528 --> 28:20.700
Good.

28:40.882 --> 28:42.919
Hey, how you doing, Sylvia?

28:42.951 --> 28:45.397
I'll be doing better once you
introduce me to your friend.

28:45.420 --> 28:47.593
I saw him qualify on Red Dog.

28:47.622 --> 28:50.569
He's real good.
You guys better watch out.

28:50.592 --> 28:52.367
Are you gonna
introduce me or not?

28:52.394 --> 28:55.375
Well, of course.
Hey, Hark, come here.

28:58.066 --> 29:00.740
Harkin Banks,
I'd like you to meet Sylvia.

29:03.605 --> 29:04.811
New on the circuit?

29:06.575 --> 29:09.488
We're gonna go do Broken Arrow.
You want to ski with us?

29:09.511 --> 29:12.185
Oh, I gotta get the house ready
for the big party tonight.

29:12.214 --> 29:15.991
Oh, well, we'll see you tonight.
Can I bring you anything?

29:16.017 --> 29:17.894
Bring him.

29:17.919 --> 29:20.399
I might make him
the guest of honor.

29:20.422 --> 29:23.096
Well, you know,
he's got a friend.

29:23.124 --> 29:25.900
So, bring his friend.

29:25.927 --> 29:28.840
OK. Can I bring you
anything else?

29:28.863 --> 29:32.333
Just you, Daniel-Just you.

29:41.443 --> 29:43.184
She always makes it
to the qualifying rounds.

29:43.211 --> 29:45.088
That way she can check out
the new talent.

29:45.113 --> 29:48.287
She is beautiful.

29:48.316 --> 29:49.795
You got a good eye, kid.

29:53.555 --> 29:55.398
Watch out! Watch out!

29:57.492 --> 30:01.030
Rudi, you're a goddamn
low-life cretinous slug!

30:04.099 --> 30:07.876
You people, stay out of our way!

30:07.902 --> 30:10.815
You may ski on that side
or on that side...

30:10.839 --> 30:13.581
but stay out of the middle here.

30:13.608 --> 30:16.145
Hey, Rudi, you can kiss my ass--

30:16.177 --> 30:18.054
not on this side,
not on that side...

30:18.079 --> 30:19.581
but right in ze middle.

30:24.185 --> 30:27.758
Come, Heinz.
We finish this later.

30:37.866 --> 30:39.243
What is it with that guy?

30:39.267 --> 30:41.440
Sylvia used to be
Rudi's girlfriend...

30:41.469 --> 30:43.574
till someone long-dicked her
in Europe.

30:43.605 --> 30:45.551
He figures it was me.

30:45.573 --> 30:46.881
Couldn't blame a guy,
though, could you?

30:46.908 --> 30:49.115
Uh-uh. Sylvia's sure got
what it takes.

30:49.144 --> 30:50.452
That's why
she's got the Rudettes...

30:50.478 --> 30:51.855
drooling all over her.

30:51.880 --> 30:54.383
- Rudettes?
-Rudi's gang.

30:54.416 --> 30:56.054
They're so far up his ass,
they don't know...

30:56.084 --> 30:58.758
where he leaves off
and they begin.

30:58.787 --> 31:02.758
Hey, what do you say
we tear up this mountain?

31:02.791 --> 31:04.202
OK, let's hit it!

31:05.226 --> 31:06.705
All right, let's go!

31:06.728 --> 31:08.002
Come on!

33:43.318 --> 33:45.059
I swear to God,
it's the funniest thing...

33:45.086 --> 33:46.394
you ever saw was Squirrel--

33:46.421 --> 33:48.401
Hey, you guys
talking about me again?

33:48.423 --> 33:52.064
Squirrel skiing with his pants
split up the middle.

33:52.093 --> 33:54.505
Hey, it was too hot
to wear underwear.

33:54.529 --> 33:57.601
So he skis down right in front
of the TV cameras, right?

33:57.632 --> 33:59.771
He passes,
and he bows to the judge.

33:59.801 --> 34:03.146
He flashes the biggest moon
you ever seen in your life.

34:03.171 --> 34:04.809
It must have been
a hell of a jump, Squirrel...

34:04.839 --> 34:07.149
to rip your pants off.

34:10.378 --> 34:11.686
Hey, Kendo's right.

34:11.713 --> 34:14.626
I cranked off the triple,
I flew a hundred yards.

34:14.649 --> 34:17.721
Fuckin'-A, man.
That jump was totally awesome.

34:18.987 --> 34:20.989
Guys, I'd like to propose
a little toast...

34:21.022 --> 34:22.262
to Squirrel Murphy.

34:22.290 --> 34:25.828
He's been on the world
freestyle circuit for 4 years.

34:25.860 --> 34:28.806
He's made $392,
been laid twice.

34:28.830 --> 34:31.833
Once every other year--
not bad, Squirrel.

34:31.866 --> 34:35.507
And I would like to toast
Snake-legs Banks...

34:35.536 --> 34:37.175
the Bonners Ferry flash...

34:37.205 --> 34:39.081
the newest member
of the Rat Pack.

34:39.107 --> 34:41.815
- All right!
-All right!

34:49.751 --> 34:51.094
There it is.

34:59.994 --> 35:02.338
- Do you see mine, Dan?
-Yeah, you're on it.

35:02.363 --> 35:05.970
- What about me, Dan?
-Slasher, Kendo, Squirrel.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.503
All right.
What about Fergy and Dagger?

35:08.536 --> 35:10.106
That's it.

35:10.138 --> 35:11.583
What the hell?

35:11.606 --> 35:15.019
Fader, come back here,
goddamn it!

35:15.043 --> 35:18.047
4 years on the circuit, and
he gets cut-you believe it?

35:18.079 --> 35:19.717
Dagger and Fergy skied better...

35:19.747 --> 35:21.385
than most of the Europeans
on the tour.

35:21.416 --> 35:23.020
That doesn't seem fair.

35:23.051 --> 35:24.724
It isn't.

35:26.054 --> 35:27.192
Fender--

35:27.221 --> 35:30.031
Dan, I know what you're gonna
say, but we're running a show.

35:30.058 --> 35:32.038
Well, how come you cut
Fergy and Dagger?

35:32.060 --> 35:33.801
- They just didn't make it.
-Didn't make it?

35:33.828 --> 35:35.808
They ski better
than half the Europeans.

35:35.830 --> 35:37.605
You call yourselves promoters?

35:37.632 --> 35:40.738
It's a business. Accommodations
have to be made, O'Callahan.

35:40.768 --> 35:42.406
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

35:42.437 --> 35:45.043
You know, I remember
when this used to be a sport.

35:45.073 --> 35:47.019
We've got
fourteen European sponsors...

35:47.041 --> 35:49.715
paying for TV coverage
for one name skier.

35:49.744 --> 35:52.054
Lose that name,
and the circuit folds.

35:52.080 --> 35:54.560
All right, now we're saddled
with European sponsors.

35:54.582 --> 35:56.186
That means
certain Europeans qualify.

35:56.217 --> 35:58.561
And certain Americans
don't qualify?

35:58.586 --> 36:00.224
Hey, guys, we haven't had...

36:00.254 --> 36:02.291
an American winner
in over five years.

36:02.323 --> 36:04.735
Now, look, Dan, there hasn't
been an American freestyler...

36:04.759 --> 36:06.363
who could beat Garmischt
in five years.

36:06.394 --> 36:09.170
We landed the meet here
because of him!

36:09.197 --> 36:11.837
Oh, I see.

36:11.866 --> 36:14.972
So, it's a business,
is that it, fellas?

36:15.003 --> 36:20.476
O'Callahan, it's show business.

36:20.508 --> 36:22.454
Yeah? Well, why don't you
explain that...

36:22.477 --> 36:23.820
to those kids
that have traveled...

36:23.845 --> 36:25.825
over a thousand miles
to get here.

36:25.847 --> 36:27.520
What are you getting
so bent out of shape for...

36:27.548 --> 36:29.755
O'Callahan? You made it.

36:29.784 --> 36:32.162
You've been over the hill
for five years.

36:33.721 --> 36:34.893
Now, Dan.

36:38.326 --> 36:39.737
I don't like that guy.

36:39.761 --> 36:42.537
Come on, I'll buy you a beer,
we'll talk about it, hmm?

36:42.563 --> 36:45.043
Fader, come on,
we go back a long way.

36:45.066 --> 36:47.376
You're an old
free-dagger yourself.

36:47.402 --> 36:50.076
Dan, I'm between a rock
and a hard place.

36:51.973 --> 36:53.680
It's bullshit.

36:57.578 --> 36:59.216
Bullshit.

37:12.960 --> 37:15.531
- What was that?
-A burst of courage.

37:18.032 --> 37:19.807
What's that mean?

37:19.834 --> 37:22.144
It's a prescription
for crowd scenes.

37:25.540 --> 37:27.281
You don't need that.

37:27.308 --> 37:30.721
Look, Harkin, it's my business
what I swallow, OK?

37:37.452 --> 37:39.363
Well, what was it?

37:39.387 --> 37:41.993
What difference does it make?

37:42.023 --> 37:43.798
Well, I don't like it.

37:43.825 --> 37:46.362
Well, tough.
What do you think...

37:46.394 --> 37:49.068
we spend one night together,
and you own me?

38:11.085 --> 38:12.325
Good evening, Harkin.

38:14.155 --> 38:16.499
So glad you could make it.

38:16.524 --> 38:17.764
Your friend?

38:17.792 --> 38:21.330
Yeah. Sylvia, this is Sunny.
Sunny, Sylvia.

38:22.830 --> 38:24.741
You were terrific today, Harkin.

38:24.766 --> 38:26.871
I haven't seen a skier
like you in years...

38:26.901 --> 38:28.278
and I've seen them all.

38:28.302 --> 38:31.078
I'll bet you have.

38:31.105 --> 38:32.482
Thanks.

38:32.507 --> 38:34.680
- Are you a skier?
-No.

38:34.709 --> 38:36.347
Just a spectator, then?

38:36.377 --> 38:39.358
Right, except I haven't
found the mountain yet.

38:39.380 --> 38:42.691
Ah, well, it's the big hill
with the snow all over it.

38:42.717 --> 38:44.822
I'll keep an eye out for it.

38:46.420 --> 38:50.891
- She's very interesting.
-Yeah.

38:50.925 --> 38:54.702
Well, it's a really nice place
you have here.

38:54.729 --> 38:56.140
Thank you.

38:56.164 --> 38:59.304
I've scheduled you
for a private tour later on.

38:59.333 --> 39:02.075
I don't think I want you
to miss anything.

39:16.751 --> 39:19.322
- Hey, kid.
-Oh, hey, Dan.

39:19.353 --> 39:22.197
Wild party. Better keep an eye
on your girlfriend.

39:26.727 --> 39:29.298
- She's not my girlfriend.
-Right.

40:27.388 --> 40:29.061
I'm Squirrel Murphy.

40:29.090 --> 40:31.070
Georgette.

40:31.092 --> 40:34.301
I suppose a fuck's
out of the question, huh?

40:35.763 --> 40:37.970
Ask me
when I'm in a better mood.

41:00.688 --> 41:03.464
The air is so clean
in the mountains.

41:03.491 --> 41:06.438
Yeah. It's just like back home.

41:06.460 --> 41:09.031
- Where's home?
-In Bonners Ferry, Idaho...

41:09.063 --> 41:11.373
where the men are men,
and the sheep are nervous.

41:12.967 --> 41:15.379
Well, you wouldn't
make me nervous.

41:17.204 --> 41:18.740
A little excited, maybe.

41:21.742 --> 41:23.085
Let me buy you a drink.

41:24.078 --> 41:25.250
Come on.

41:45.633 --> 41:48.307
- I don't understand.
-I don't either.

42:01.148 --> 42:06.621
A toast to Dom Perignon
and the World Cup.

42:06.654 --> 42:07.758
Who's he?

42:09.957 --> 42:12.369
A famous French skier.

42:12.393 --> 42:13.963
I never heard of him.

42:35.216 --> 42:37.218
So, what happens now?

42:39.353 --> 42:42.391
First,
we take off our clothes...

42:42.423 --> 42:44.926
and then we fuck our brains out.

44:34.135 --> 44:36.081
Hey, who needs a drink?
Miss, could I--

44:36.103 --> 44:38.640
Fergy. will you let the lady
sit down, please?

44:38.672 --> 44:40.481
What can I get you?

44:43.110 --> 44:44.612
I don't know.

44:44.645 --> 44:46.852
How about something hot?

44:46.881 --> 44:48.155
Hot.

44:48.182 --> 44:52.995
Uh, may I recommend
my specialty-the leg spreader?

44:53.020 --> 44:57.093
It starts with a little vodka...

44:57.124 --> 44:59.730
and a touch of scotch.

44:59.760 --> 45:00.966
You're gonna love this.

45:01.996 --> 45:03.873
Then...

45:03.898 --> 45:06.606
a little bit of brandy.

45:06.634 --> 45:08.580
This will pick you up.

45:08.602 --> 45:13.347
A skosh
of Mother's Myers's rum...

45:14.875 --> 45:19.187
and the blessings
of a lemon twist.

45:22.349 --> 45:24.124
Try that on for size.

45:46.774 --> 45:48.879
It's working.

45:48.909 --> 45:52.049
Now, that's a girl
I can take advantage of.

45:52.079 --> 45:53.558
Now, Squirrel.

46:10.698 --> 46:12.700
I hope that's your leg.

47:13.227 --> 47:16.231
It feels very good, ja?

47:20.434 --> 47:21.572
Excuse me.

47:21.602 --> 47:23.582
Please, don't worry.

47:23.604 --> 47:25.550
We are all friends here.

47:27.574 --> 47:29.576
Be my guest.

47:29.610 --> 47:31.886
I think you need some fluid.

47:31.912 --> 47:33.118
Some more.

47:36.050 --> 47:37.620
Please, you finish.

47:49.029 --> 47:51.839
You know, I'm very sorry...

47:51.865 --> 47:54.812
that we didn't get along
so well...

47:54.835 --> 47:56.872
the first time that we met.

47:58.305 --> 48:00.842
It was a long day,
and I had a headache...

48:00.874 --> 48:05.880
and I must apologize
for the way that I acted.

48:05.913 --> 48:08.792
But I hope
that you understand...

48:08.816 --> 48:12.320
that I'm really not
such a bad guy.

48:15.589 --> 48:18.627
Just-just relax.

48:20.094 --> 48:22.438
That is why we are here.

48:25.599 --> 48:27.476
Just relax.

48:50.457 --> 48:51.697
Aw, man.

48:53.260 --> 48:54.705
Aw, Dan, what happened?

48:54.728 --> 48:57.834
Well, I was fixing a drink,
and I hit a tree.

48:57.865 --> 48:59.572
Compound spiral.

48:59.600 --> 49:01.705
Hey, Dan, you think maybe
I can use your skis...

49:01.735 --> 49:02.873
while you're laid up?

49:02.903 --> 49:06.942
Well, it might not be that bad!
Let's party!

49:08.242 --> 49:09.516
Who wants a beer?

49:11.945 --> 49:13.982
Guys, let's get out of here!

49:14.014 --> 49:15.891
Hey, let's go!

49:16.950 --> 49:19.590
Get ready to party.
Who wants a beer down here?

49:22.756 --> 49:26.829
Well, look who's here--
Mr. Personality.

49:26.860 --> 49:29.568
Was ist los? lhr schweinhund.

49:29.596 --> 49:31.633
No kidding?

49:31.665 --> 49:34.407
Hey, Rudi, have a beer on me.

49:37.704 --> 49:39.877
Say, little rookie...

49:43.710 --> 49:46.987
do you know what I had
for breakfast this morning?

49:47.014 --> 49:48.584
Wheaties.

49:48.615 --> 49:50.925
Very clever, but no.

49:50.951 --> 49:53.864
No, it was quite a feast, ja.

49:53.887 --> 49:57.130
How do you say
in your language--

49:57.157 --> 50:01.162
I had Sunny side up,
and I had Sunny side down...

50:01.195 --> 50:06.577
and I had Sunny side
all the way around.

50:06.600 --> 50:08.978
You toad-sucking son of a bitch!

50:10.170 --> 50:11.979
Don't worry.

50:12.005 --> 50:15.111
I threw the little fish back
when I finished with her.

50:15.142 --> 50:17.850
Rudi,
you hit a new low this time.

50:17.878 --> 50:20.722
Oh. You're hurting my feelings,
my good friend.

50:20.747 --> 50:23.353
- Hey, Garmshit.
-Garmischt.

50:23.383 --> 50:25.761
Yeah, Garmshit. Why don't you
ask the rookie here...

50:25.786 --> 50:28.824
about his bubble bath
with Sylvia last night?

50:28.856 --> 50:30.836
That's right. Rudi.
You've been backdoored again...

50:30.858 --> 50:32.462
but this time,
right in the same house.

50:32.493 --> 50:36.373
Yeah, you just ain't staying
on Sylvia's top forty, shorty.

50:37.865 --> 50:43.838
Ja, we will see you showoffs,
you comedians, tonight, ja?

50:43.871 --> 50:46.215
If you are not cowards.

50:46.240 --> 50:48.049
And I especially hope
that you, little rookie...

50:48.075 --> 50:50.555
won't be too shy to join us.

50:50.577 --> 50:52.113
I'll be there.

51:00.622 --> 51:03.102
Be where?

51:03.124 --> 51:04.262
Rudi challenged us...

51:04.292 --> 51:06.898
to a broom-ball match
tonight at the Arena.

51:06.928 --> 51:08.236
All right.

51:08.263 --> 51:11.574
Welcome, everybody,
to the first major event...

51:11.599 --> 51:13.374
of the F.l.S.
World Cup competition...

51:13.401 --> 51:15.074
here in Squaw Valley, U.S.A...

51:15.103 --> 51:18.607
site of the 1960
Winter Olympic Games.

51:18.640 --> 51:20.677
We're here on East Broadway...

51:20.708 --> 51:23.188
to see the finest
freestyle skiers in the world...

51:23.211 --> 51:25.714
going for the gold
in three events--

51:25.747 --> 51:26.953
ballet this afternoon...

51:26.981 --> 51:29.894
moguls tomorrow,
and aerials on Sunday.

51:41.829 --> 51:43.536
Into the starting gate...

51:43.565 --> 51:46.341
Good luck, Slasher.
Go get 'em, buddy!

51:46.367 --> 51:47.607
...from
Breckenridge, Colorado.

51:52.807 --> 51:56.311
Curtis, W.

51:56.344 --> 51:58.824
Well, Curtis, you can take
your starting position.

52:01.449 --> 52:03.360
Take your starting position.

52:09.257 --> 52:10.895
Why don't you turn that down?

53:06.147 --> 53:07.626
Next up is number 101...

53:07.649 --> 53:10.220
- Herr Garmischt.
-Ja.

53:10.251 --> 53:12.492
- Good luck.
-Luck?

53:12.520 --> 53:15.160
I don't need luck.

53:16.557 --> 53:18.195
Take your starting position.

54:28.996 --> 54:30.600
That was Rudolf Garmischt...

54:30.631 --> 54:33.305
in a beautifully
choreographed routine.

54:33.334 --> 54:35.075
And now for
the judges' scores--

54:35.103 --> 54:40.212
9.5, 9.3, 9.5, 9.2, 9.3.

54:40.241 --> 54:43.154
That's today's best score.

54:43.177 --> 54:44.417
All right, Banks,
good luck to you.

54:44.445 --> 54:45.981
You can take
your starting position.

54:46.013 --> 54:47.185
Thank you.

56:05.426 --> 56:09.374
That was Harkin Banks
in a beautiful first run...

56:09.397 --> 56:10.842
in the F.l.S. World Cup.

56:10.865 --> 56:12.469
Let's hear it
for this newcomer...

56:12.500 --> 56:14.173
in his first
international competition.

56:14.202 --> 56:18.207
Hey! My man!
You did it! You did it!

56:19.707 --> 56:23.314
3.7, 3.6, 3.4, 3.6, 3.2.

56:23.344 --> 56:24.721
Aw, come on.

56:26.147 --> 56:28.286
You had the best run
on the hill, man.

56:28.316 --> 56:30.193
You got screwed.

56:54.308 --> 56:57.687
- Well, where are you going?
-San Francisco.

56:57.712 --> 57:00.750
It's time for me to move on.

57:00.781 --> 57:02.692
Well, where were you
last night?

57:02.717 --> 57:04.890
You sure ask a lot of questions.

57:04.919 --> 57:07.695
Well, I was worried.

57:07.722 --> 57:10.566
- I'm sure.
-I was.

57:10.591 --> 57:13.071
You were with Rudi,
weren't you?

57:13.094 --> 57:15.233
And what difference
would it make?

57:15.263 --> 57:18.733
What do you mean,
what difference would it make?

57:18.766 --> 57:21.303
And what were you doing
in the hot tub with Sylvia?

57:22.737 --> 57:25.411
You surprise me, too, H.

57:25.439 --> 57:28.682
- She gave me this stuff.
-Oh, that's bullshit!

57:28.709 --> 57:30.120
I didn't know what I was doing.

57:30.144 --> 57:32.886
Tell me about it.

57:32.914 --> 57:35.588
- Don't forget your shampoo.
-It's already packed.

57:38.719 --> 57:40.596
I think you should stay, Sunny.

57:43.591 --> 57:45.571
Here. Don't forget this.

57:49.363 --> 57:53.209
Give it to your girlfriend,
Miss Plastic Tits.

58:03.544 --> 58:06.855
Company, halt!

58:06.881 --> 58:08.326
Ready...

58:08.349 --> 58:10.056
They look nervous.

58:10.084 --> 58:12.121
Hey. guys. anything goes.

58:12.153 --> 58:14.497
That's right. Take no prisoners.

58:14.522 --> 58:18.664
Eins, zwei, drei, vier!
Eins, zwei, drei, vier!

58:20.328 --> 58:22.399
- Squirrel.
-All right.

58:26.133 --> 58:27.703
Maybe we should spot them
a couple goals.

58:27.735 --> 58:28.873
What do you think, guys?

58:28.903 --> 58:30.041
They're not gonna play serious,
are they?

58:30.071 --> 58:31.482
I don't think so, no.

58:31.505 --> 58:33.985
- Break!
-Break!

58:34.008 --> 58:36.181
- You guys ready?
-Yeah!

58:36.210 --> 58:37.553
- You ready?
-Jawohl!

58:37.578 --> 58:42.425
OK, play hard, play fair,
and keep your sticks down.

58:53.694 --> 58:55.105
Great job!

58:56.464 --> 58:57.636
Come on!

59:36.771 --> 59:37.943
You busy for dinner?

59:42.576 --> 59:44.385
- Get out of here!
-Out of the way!

59:44.412 --> 59:45.584
Come on!

01:00:15.009 --> 01:00:18.081
You know something, guys?
I'm getting too old for this.

01:00:18.112 --> 01:00:20.786
Did you see that Garmischt
blind-side me?

01:00:20.815 --> 01:00:22.624
They were vicious, but we tried.

01:00:22.650 --> 01:00:28.066
Yeah. Hey, we were small,
but we were slow.

01:00:28.089 --> 01:00:29.261
Funny.

01:00:30.925 --> 01:00:32.199
Yeah, next time!

01:00:32.226 --> 01:00:35.696
Next time, we'll have uniforms!

01:00:35.730 --> 01:00:37.903
Hey, you guys want to go
for a nightcap at the Lone Star?

01:00:37.932 --> 01:00:40.071
Oh, hey, listen, man.
We'll join you later.

01:00:40.101 --> 01:00:41.944
Me and the kid,
we got something to do.

01:00:41.969 --> 01:00:44.415
This game's not over yet.

01:00:44.438 --> 01:00:47.214
Let's show 'em
a little Irish hospitality.

01:00:47.241 --> 01:00:49.915
Rudi! He's gonna love this.

01:00:51.879 --> 01:00:53.756
Son of a bitch!

01:00:55.583 --> 01:00:57.085
Come on.

01:01:06.393 --> 01:01:07.531
Luck of the Irish.

01:01:07.561 --> 01:01:10.440
- How did you do that?
-It's my lock.

01:01:15.503 --> 01:01:16.675
Come on.

01:01:26.947 --> 01:01:28.949
Look what we found.

01:01:40.561 --> 01:01:43.064
All right, guys. Watch this.

01:02:00.915 --> 01:02:03.794
What the--Heinz!

01:02:11.125 --> 01:02:12.763
Rat Pack.

01:02:36.851 --> 01:02:38.091
Can I give you a hand
with that?

01:02:38.118 --> 01:02:39.153
No, thanks. I got it.

01:02:39.186 --> 01:02:40.824
- You sure?
-Yeah, sure.

01:03:12.086 --> 01:03:13.531
Son of a bitch!

01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:18.131
You!

01:03:18.158 --> 01:03:19.694
I saw you fall.

01:03:19.727 --> 01:03:22.503
I thought I'd just stop
and give you a few pointers.

01:03:22.529 --> 01:03:24.133
Yeah, you've got a couple,
so why don't you...

01:03:24.164 --> 01:03:26.644
point 'em that way
and crawl out of my sight?

01:03:26.667 --> 01:03:28.669
Aw, you gotta learn
to bend your knees.

01:03:28.702 --> 01:03:31.945
Get your mama to bend her knees.
I don't have time.

01:03:31.972 --> 01:03:34.543
That way you could
suck up the bumps.

01:03:36.243 --> 01:03:39.486
You do know how to do that,
don't you?

01:03:39.513 --> 01:03:41.857
Here, let me give you a hand.

01:03:41.882 --> 01:03:45.455
I can see why Harkin likes you.

01:03:45.486 --> 01:03:47.830
Oh, I get it. Switch hitter--

01:03:47.855 --> 01:03:50.461
first Harkin and now me.

01:03:50.491 --> 01:03:53.438
You really are a sicko, lady!

01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:57.101
Maybe you and Harkin--
we could all get together later.

01:03:57.131 --> 01:03:59.907
Harkin can do
whatever the hell he pleases!

01:03:59.934 --> 01:04:02.778
All I was doing was having
a little fun with him.

01:04:02.803 --> 01:04:04.043
You can have him back.

01:04:04.071 --> 01:04:07.712
Ooh, if I could only ski,
I'd take this pole and--

01:04:07.741 --> 01:04:09.778
If you get bored with Harkin,
send him over later on.

01:04:09.810 --> 01:04:12.222
I still have a few tricks
up my sleeve.

01:04:14.381 --> 01:04:16.725
Oh, so what, bitch?

01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:22.000
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:04:22.022 --> 01:04:23.933
Welcome
to the mogul competition...

01:04:23.958 --> 01:04:26.438
the second event
of this championship weekend.

01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:28.098
After the ballet competition...

01:04:28.128 --> 01:04:30.972
Rudolf Garmischt of Austria
is in first place...

01:04:30.998 --> 01:04:33.706
followed by Werner Bleiner
of West Germany in second...

01:04:33.734 --> 01:04:35.441
Heinz Hartmann of Austria
in third...

01:04:35.469 --> 01:04:37.972
Kendo Yamamoto of Japan
in fourth position...

01:04:38.005 --> 01:04:40.576
and newcomer Harkin Banks
of the United States...

01:04:40.607 --> 01:04:41.813
in fifth place.

01:04:41.842 --> 01:04:44.413
Right behind Banks in sixth
is Dan O'Callahan...

01:04:44.445 --> 01:04:46.322
of the U.S.,
followed by Squirrel...

01:04:46.347 --> 01:04:48.793
I'm after Rudi.

01:04:48.816 --> 01:04:50.352
The luck of the draw.

01:04:50.384 --> 01:04:51.988
It's a tough act to follow...

01:04:52.019 --> 01:04:54.090
but if you ski like you did
when you qualified...

01:04:54.121 --> 01:04:56.260
you could be the kid
we're looking for.

01:06:24.545 --> 01:06:26.889
And now the current
world champion...

01:06:26.914 --> 01:06:29.190
Rudi Garmischt,
to the starting gate.

01:06:32.019 --> 01:06:34.499
Garmischt,
any time you're ready, huh?

01:06:34.521 --> 01:06:36.194
Just a moment.

01:07:19.266 --> 01:07:20.438
Go, Rudi!

01:07:20.467 --> 01:07:23.607
A spectacular run
by Rudi Garmischt!

01:07:23.637 --> 01:07:25.275
In a moment,
the judges' scores.

01:07:25.305 --> 01:07:28.218
One thing about Rudi,
he sure can ski.

01:07:28.242 --> 01:07:32.190
9.7, 9.3, 9.7, 9.9, 10.

01:07:32.212 --> 01:07:35.455
49.1! Beautiful!

01:07:35.482 --> 01:07:37.621
He might have been great once.

01:07:37.651 --> 01:07:40.097
He wasn't that good today.

01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:41.724
Kid, let me tell you something.

01:07:41.755 --> 01:07:43.860
He didn't win the World Cup
three years in a row...

01:07:43.891 --> 01:07:45.131
because he's bad.

01:07:45.159 --> 01:07:48.003
Next up is Harkin Banks,
number 149.

01:07:48.028 --> 01:07:49.200
Go get 'em, kid.

01:07:56.637 --> 01:08:00.710
Hey, Banks, nice run in ballet
the other day, huh?

01:08:00.741 --> 01:08:03.153
- Thank you.
-Yeah, it's all right.

01:08:03.177 --> 01:08:05.020
Well, it's any time
you're ready now.

01:08:05.045 --> 01:08:06.547
Good luck.

01:08:24.163 --> 01:08:25.336
All right!

01:08:40.981 --> 01:08:42.483
Yeah, all right!

01:09:01.535 --> 01:09:02.673
You did it!

01:09:02.703 --> 01:09:04.740
Harkin Banks!
A beautiful run...

01:09:04.770 --> 01:09:07.115
in his first
international competition!

01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:10.814
- All right!
-Here come the judges' scores.

01:09:10.844 --> 01:09:17.988
7.3, 3.3, 9.0, 3.0, 7.9".

01:09:18.018 --> 01:09:21.295
For a total of 41.0.

01:09:21.321 --> 01:09:23.460
Bullshit! Bullshit!

01:09:25.859 --> 01:09:26.997
Come on!

01:09:27.027 --> 01:09:28.165
What's the matter
with you guys?

01:09:28.194 --> 01:09:30.970
- You suck!
-Squirrel.

01:10:01.795 --> 01:10:03.604
Attention, please.

01:10:03.630 --> 01:10:05.610
Will all finalists
in the aerials...

01:10:05.632 --> 01:10:08.943
please report to the top
of the jump immediately.

01:10:08.969 --> 01:10:10.778
Competition will begin
in thirty minutes.

01:10:10.804 --> 01:10:12.374
Thank you.

01:10:15.609 --> 01:10:18.613
Hey, guys, there are
only four seats to a gondola...

01:10:18.645 --> 01:10:20.283
so someone's gonna have
to ride by himself.

01:10:20.314 --> 01:10:22.453
Let's throw
one or two fingers...

01:10:22.482 --> 01:10:24.393
to see who stays behind.
You ready?

01:10:24.418 --> 01:10:27.763
One, two, three!

01:10:27.788 --> 01:10:31.292
Sorry, Squirrel. Come on, guys.

01:10:39.099 --> 01:10:41.545
The best two out of three?

01:11:24.444 --> 01:11:25.946
What's your name?

01:11:26.947 --> 01:11:28.756
Squirrel.

01:11:29.783 --> 01:11:31.922
That's cute.

01:11:31.952 --> 01:11:35.490
- What's yours?
-Vicki.

01:11:41.395 --> 01:11:42.635
You missed a spot.

01:11:45.098 --> 01:11:46.702
What, here?

01:11:57.344 --> 01:12:00.325
You never know where
you're gonna get burned.

01:12:01.915 --> 01:12:04.327
You don't want to miss
any spots.

01:12:12.759 --> 01:12:14.761
No, you sure don't.

01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:06.351
Squirrel, all right!

01:13:12.419 --> 01:13:13.591
All right, Squirrel!

01:13:38.278 --> 01:13:40.690
Welcome, everybody.

01:13:40.714 --> 01:13:44.890
As we go into the final event
of this F.l.S. World Cup...

01:13:44.918 --> 01:13:46.955
Rudolf Garmischt
is in first place...

01:13:46.987 --> 01:13:48.933
Harkin Banks in second...

01:13:48.955 --> 01:13:50.798
Heinz Hartmann
in third position...

01:13:50.824 --> 01:13:52.633
Kendo Yamamoto in fourth...

01:13:52.659 --> 01:13:56.129
and in fifth place,
in a surprise return to form...

01:13:56.162 --> 01:13:58.540
Squaw Valley's
favorite freestyler...

01:13:58.565 --> 01:14:00.238
Dan O'Callahan.

01:14:11.611 --> 01:14:14.683
Ah, Mr. Yamamoto. How are you?

01:14:14.714 --> 01:14:18.161
Good, good. So, what jump
have you got for us today?

01:14:19.819 --> 01:14:22.561
All right.
Yeah, we got Yamamoto ready.

01:14:22.589 --> 01:14:24.728
He's gonna throw a sai, a sush-

01:14:24.758 --> 01:14:28.433
mits-sushi mitsabish--
yama-what?

01:14:29.529 --> 01:14:31.099
Did you get that?

01:14:31.131 --> 01:14:33.008
That's close enough.

01:14:33.033 --> 01:14:34.603
OK. All set?

01:14:34.634 --> 01:14:36.079
You can go.

01:14:39.272 --> 01:14:40.546
Banzai!

01:16:10.830 --> 01:16:12.673
All right!

01:16:14.968 --> 01:16:17.574
A beautiful jump
by Harkin Banks!

01:16:17.604 --> 01:16:19.049
That's gonna put him
within striking distance...

01:16:19.072 --> 01:16:20.210
of Rudi Garmischt.

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.412
All right.

01:16:22.942 --> 01:16:24.387
The pressure's on, Rudi.

01:16:24.411 --> 01:16:25.754
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:16:25.779 --> 01:16:28.726
we are now down to
the last two jumps of the day.

01:16:28.748 --> 01:16:30.421
The results of these jumps...

01:16:30.450 --> 01:16:34.023
will determine the overall
F.I.S. World Cup champion.

01:16:34.054 --> 01:16:35.624
Well, kinda looks like...

01:16:35.655 --> 01:16:37.896
you got your work cut out
for you today, huh, Rudi?

01:16:38.268 --> 01:16:40.748
I have nothing to worry about.

01:16:40.770 --> 01:16:42.943
What's your pleasure?

01:16:42.973 --> 01:16:46.819
A lay tuck tuck triple.

01:16:46.843 --> 01:16:49.551
OK. Yeah,
we got Garmischt all set.

01:16:49.579 --> 01:16:51.559
He's throwing a triple.

01:16:51.581 --> 01:16:55.154
A lay tuck tuck triple.

01:16:55.185 --> 01:16:57.187
Right.

01:16:57.220 --> 01:16:59.393
OK, Rudi, you can go anytime.

01:17:33.523 --> 01:17:35.264
That was Rudi Garmischt...

01:17:35.292 --> 01:17:37.670
with a spectacularly executed
triple jump.

01:17:37.694 --> 01:17:39.037
Not bad.

01:17:41.998 --> 01:17:43.170
No shit.

01:17:43.199 --> 01:17:47.375
A 9.8, 9.9, 9.8, a 10,
and a 9.9.

01:17:47.404 --> 01:17:49.315
It's gonna be hard
to beat that one.

01:17:49.339 --> 01:17:51.842
...for a total of 49.4.

01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:55.353
Yeah! Nice going!

01:18:01.851 --> 01:18:04.354
What's this "Kiss-ass blaster"?

01:18:06.222 --> 01:18:07.895
My jump.

01:18:07.924 --> 01:18:09.460
Yeah, well,
I got to know what it is...

01:18:09.492 --> 01:18:11.563
before I can let you go down.

01:18:13.129 --> 01:18:14.574
It's a twist and triple.

01:18:14.597 --> 01:18:16.736
A twist and triple?

01:18:16.766 --> 01:18:18.370
I've never seen
one of those before.

01:18:18.401 --> 01:18:19.778
Are you qualified for that?

01:18:22.605 --> 01:18:24.585
Well, I'm gonna do it.

01:18:35.485 --> 01:18:36.987
Good luck.

01:19:25.402 --> 01:19:27.473
Let's hear it
for Harkin Banks--

01:19:27.504 --> 01:19:30.007
a beautiful triple
by this exciting newcomer...

01:19:30.039 --> 01:19:31.712
from Bonners Ferry, Idaho!

01:19:38.348 --> 01:19:39.520
Hey, look at that!

01:19:39.549 --> 01:19:44.623
9.7, 9.8, 9.9, 9.3,
and a 9.3.

01:19:44.654 --> 01:19:47.362
That makes Rudolf Garmischt
all-around world champion...

01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:49.802
with a clean sweep
of all events.

01:19:49.826 --> 01:19:53.672
Second overall is Harkin Banks
in his first F.l.S. competition.

01:20:01.805 --> 01:20:07.346
Hey, Rudi, how's it feel to win
and be second best?

01:20:16.653 --> 01:20:19.293
Hey, come back here,
you goddamn coward!

01:20:57.093 --> 01:20:58.538
We win the trophy!

01:21:03.099 --> 01:21:04.339
Congratulations.

01:21:41.638 --> 01:21:42.844
Cut it out!

01:22:16.973 --> 01:22:18.816
You know something, Rudi?

01:22:18.841 --> 01:22:22.311
I think it's time
we settle this once and for all.

01:22:22.345 --> 01:22:26.487
Hey, Squirrel,
spot me fifty bucks.

01:22:26.516 --> 01:22:28.518
Fifty?

01:22:28.551 --> 01:22:30.531
Make it forty.

01:22:38.361 --> 01:22:41.774
Chinese downhill.
Forty bucks a man.

01:22:41.798 --> 01:22:44.108
Winner takes all.

01:22:44.133 --> 01:22:47.774
Ja. It is the only way--

01:22:47.804 --> 01:22:49.545
Chinese downhill!

01:22:49.572 --> 01:22:52.178
Oh, and, uh, Rudi...

01:22:52.208 --> 01:22:53.949
why don't you bring the trophy?

01:22:53.977 --> 01:22:57.117
I think it should go
to the real champion.

01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:59.500
I am the champion.

01:22:59.916 --> 01:23:03.921
The Chinese downhill
will decide everything.

01:23:05.321 --> 01:23:08.359
Ja. It is agreed.

01:23:08.391 --> 01:23:11.372
Chinese downhill.

01:23:14.664 --> 01:23:17.372
What the fuck
is Chinese downhill?

01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:45.097
Good luck, kid.

01:24:46.689 --> 01:24:48.225
See you at the bottom.

01:24:54.630 --> 01:24:56.405
Oh, boy.

01:25:09.912 --> 01:25:12.017
All right.
Listen up, everybody!

01:25:12.048 --> 01:25:13.186
And now for the rules...

01:25:13.216 --> 01:25:15.423
of the international
Chinese downhill--

01:25:15.451 --> 01:25:17.488
there are none.

01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:20.194
It's every man for himself.

01:25:20.223 --> 01:25:22.362
Anything goes.

01:25:22.391 --> 01:25:24.371
The first man
to cross the finish line...

01:25:24.393 --> 01:25:26.873
and grab the trophy
wins the downhill.

01:25:26.896 --> 01:25:30.867
And the winner takes all--
2,300 bucks!

01:25:32.001 --> 01:25:36.177
Everybody,
on your marks, get set...

01:26:58.588 --> 01:27:00.465
Out of the way!

01:28:03.019 --> 01:28:04.794
Sayonara!

01:28:38.688 --> 01:28:40.531
Wipe-out!

01:29:08.617 --> 01:29:10.893
Scratch an itch?

01:29:55.264 --> 01:29:56.436
Watch out!
