02:07.260 --> 02:09.076
<i>Father...</i>

02:11.164 --> 02:13.446
<i>where are you?</i>

05:35.401 --> 05:37.270
<i>Father...</i>

05:37.570 --> 05:39.853
<i>speak to me.</i>

09:56.596 --> 09:58.665
I have water for you here, Yeshua.

10:00.299 --> 10:03.149
That's what your mother
calls you, isn't it?

10:05.271 --> 10:08.255
Any name that's good enough for Mary
is good enough for me.

10:15.014 --> 10:17.664
And what does your father call you?

10:53.352 --> 10:55.201
Yeshua.

12:03.388 --> 12:05.204
Hello?

12:45.615 --> 12:48.731
I'm looking for water. I can work for it.

12:51.103 --> 12:52.739
- What can you do?
- Whatever's needed.

12:52.839 --> 12:56.555
You're building up here.
I know carpentry and stone.

13:06.051 --> 13:10.369
- Where are you headed?
- Jerusalem, but I'm a little lost.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.499
Where are you coming from?

13:19.599 --> 13:22.001
From spending time in the desert.

13:22.101 --> 13:24.900
Why? There's nothing here.

13:29.875 --> 13:32.207
What is Jerusalem like?

13:34.546 --> 13:37.137
Dirty and corrupt.

13:37.983 --> 13:41.684
But also alive. Very alive.

13:43.522 --> 13:46.993
- Do you have a father?
- Yes. He's out.

13:47.093 --> 13:50.597
- He'll ask me if I offered you food.
- That's not necessary.

13:51.697 --> 13:53.649
Thank you.

13:53.749 --> 13:57.483
Stay. Please. Rest for a while.

14:16.522 --> 14:20.284
Talking to your father
is like talking to a rock.

14:21.560 --> 14:26.033
He's so busy with his little things,
the shape of a drop of dew,

14:26.133 --> 14:30.137
the sound roots make breaking
their way through the ground.

14:30.237 --> 14:33.205
Everything matters more to him than you.

14:33.305 --> 14:35.207
No.

14:35.307 --> 14:37.673
My father loves me.

14:39.478 --> 14:42.147
He is amused by you.

14:42.247 --> 14:44.713
He loves himself only.

14:49.588 --> 14:51.590
Are you lost?

14:51.690 --> 14:52.955
No.

14:54.660 --> 14:57.164
Are you one of those preachers?

14:57.264 --> 15:01.911
Looking for something here in the desert
that you can't find anywhere else?

15:04.704 --> 15:08.428
How long have you been out here, holy man?

15:09.141 --> 15:12.212
Since the last full moon.
Maybe a little longer.

15:12.312 --> 15:13.747
Alone?

15:13.847 --> 15:17.513
No. You people are never alone.

15:18.084 --> 15:22.307
Some spirit or something
is always with you, isn't it?

15:24.089 --> 15:28.628
Tell me one thing you've learned out here,
and I'll offer you shelter for the night.

15:28.728 --> 15:33.129
- Oh, that's not necessary.
- Please. It would give me pleasure.

15:35.667 --> 15:38.570
Man makes do anywhere.

15:38.870 --> 15:41.413
Because he is man.

15:42.508 --> 15:44.373
Good.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.934
Give me a hand with this.

15:59.491 --> 16:01.356
Thank you.

16:46.438 --> 16:51.392
- There's no need to wait for her.
- I don't mean to offend, but I'm fasting.

16:58.083 --> 17:00.354
What is it?

17:00.454 --> 17:04.555
She thinks it's funny
that she wants to eat but can't...

17:04.655 --> 17:08.018
and our guest, who can, won't.

17:49.768 --> 17:52.233
What are you building up there?

17:52.604 --> 17:55.570
A house for me to live in.

17:56.342 --> 18:01.014
My father wants me to stay here.
To help him make something of this place.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.812
Is that what you want?

18:06.385 --> 18:08.984
What is it that you want?

18:13.759 --> 18:16.425
I want to go to Jerusalem.

18:16.728 --> 18:18.799
And I want to see the sea.

18:18.899 --> 18:21.968
And I want to see
the lighthouse at Alexandria.

18:22.068 --> 18:24.766
And does your father know that?

18:25.637 --> 18:27.273
No.

18:27.373 --> 18:30.238
Why don't you talk to him about it?

18:38.817 --> 18:40.617
I've seen Jerusalem.

18:40.717 --> 18:44.052
<i>I've walked away without my father
knowing and I've seen it from a ridge.</i>

18:45.724 --> 18:49.777
<i>It shines in the sun and I want it
so much, I could scream.</i>

18:55.534 --> 18:58.237
I don't want to waste my time here.

18:58.337 --> 19:00.802
Wasting life is a sin.

19:01.807 --> 19:04.739
I want to leave my footprint on the world.

19:08.964 --> 19:11.496
Come, holy man.

19:16.188 --> 19:18.524
Oh, this isn't necessary.
I can sleep outside.

19:18.624 --> 19:21.222
No. She won't bother you.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.780
Rabbi?

20:19.918 --> 20:21.750
Rabbi.

20:25.390 --> 20:28.823
I've committed a horrible sin.

20:30.095 --> 20:33.752
My son is not my husband's son.

20:34.366 --> 20:37.098
I don't want to die...

20:37.603 --> 20:40.935
and leave this lie behind me.

20:44.343 --> 20:48.200
I don't want my son trapped here forever.

20:49.781 --> 20:52.723
Help me, please.

23:09.755 --> 23:13.326
In your holy man comings-and-goings...

23:13.426 --> 23:16.191
have you learned any medicine?

23:20.065 --> 23:22.934
Cures are the only things worth seeking.

23:23.034 --> 23:27.069
For pain... suffering.

23:27.873 --> 23:31.206
The rest is just...

23:34.112 --> 23:37.415
This boy is good
at taking care of the sick.

23:37.849 --> 23:40.915
He's had practice, unfortunately.

23:41.753 --> 23:46.554
If he had come into this world somewhere
else, he could have made it his life's work.

23:47.593 --> 23:50.658
And what did you want for yourself
when you were a boy?

23:51.363 --> 23:54.367
I wanted to raise livestock...

23:54.567 --> 23:58.016
and be a butcher, like my father.

23:58.537 --> 24:01.409
He never taught me any of it, though.

24:01.573 --> 24:06.812
He said it had taken him years and years

24:06.912 --> 24:11.746
to master the skill on his own,
and he wasn't just going to give it away.

24:13.051 --> 24:17.322
"Every man must make himself."
I heard that a thousand times.

24:17.422 --> 24:19.854
He was a selfish man.

24:21.459 --> 24:23.958
And he died alone.

24:25.697 --> 24:27.834
What does your father do?

24:27.934 --> 24:30.870
Ask for permission
when you address a guest, boy.

24:30.970 --> 24:34.235
That's all right. We spoke some yesterday.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.876
My father's a carpenter.

24:38.376 --> 24:40.180
Smart man.

24:40.580 --> 24:44.645
A man who is good at work like that
can always provide for his children.

24:47.453 --> 24:51.728
And did you want to be a carpenter also
when you were a boy?

25:06.972 --> 25:10.282
Your good intentions will be wasted here.

25:10.977 --> 25:15.243
They don't need us to ruin their lives.
They'll do that all by themselves.

25:15.881 --> 25:18.198
Do you know what I do
when they're finally mine?

25:18.298 --> 25:23.217
I have them watch the life they've lived
over and over again. Forever.

25:24.355 --> 25:26.825
Oh, what anger.

25:26.925 --> 25:29.490
You are your father's son.

25:31.129 --> 25:34.098
Very well. I'll stay out of it.
Surprise me.

25:34.198 --> 25:37.866
- And if I do?
- A wager?

25:40.105 --> 25:43.059
If you can solve
this entanglement, this knot...

25:43.159 --> 25:47.424
to the satisfaction of the mother,
the father and the child,

25:47.524 --> 25:50.989
I'll stay out of your way
for the rest of your journey home.

25:55.920 --> 25:58.090
And if I fail?

25:58.190 --> 26:00.855
Failure is its own punishment.

26:02.227 --> 26:06.261
- That's Daddy talk.
- Enough for the day.

26:11.870 --> 26:15.341
This is all just an excuse
to delay your departure, isn't it?

26:15.441 --> 26:18.810
Because you're scared to go on.
Scared out of your head.

26:18.910 --> 26:21.363
You're not ready and you know it.

27:51.569 --> 27:53.401
Here.

28:50.695 --> 28:53.194
What part of a bird doesn't fly?

28:54.165 --> 28:57.686
It's a riddle.
What part of a bird doesn't fly?

29:00.171 --> 29:02.106
I don't know.

29:02.206 --> 29:04.238
Its shadow.

29:05.710 --> 29:07.947
- Did you make that up?
- Yes.

29:08.047 --> 29:10.178
It's good.

29:14.535 --> 29:16.134
Yes.

29:28.066 --> 29:31.099
I want the boy to learn a trade.

29:33.271 --> 29:36.170
There's plenty for him
to learn right here.

29:38.309 --> 29:41.179
Any trade that he wants.

29:41.579 --> 29:44.312
Or that you want for him.

29:45.016 --> 29:48.082
In Jerusalem, perhaps.

29:54.225 --> 29:56.295
I want this very much.

29:56.395 --> 30:00.700
I would need money for that.
Just to get him set up and started.

30:00.800 --> 30:04.602
No one will take him
as an apprentice without payment.

30:04.702 --> 30:07.735
For food, at least.

30:08.839 --> 30:10.642
Impossible.

30:11.742 --> 30:13.945
You are...

30:14.845 --> 30:17.282
a powerful...

30:17.682 --> 30:19.450
resourceful...

30:19.550 --> 30:22.187
beautiful man...

30:22.287 --> 30:25.019
and you will find a way.

30:26.090 --> 30:28.456
I know it.

30:37.435 --> 30:40.718
I cannot do my dying while he's here.

30:50.732 --> 30:54.766
My father was 47 when he had me.
My mother was 20.

30:56.020 --> 30:59.625
He had another wife before her,
but she died.

31:00.125 --> 31:02.937
And now my mother will die too.

31:04.028 --> 31:06.495
And my father says
a man makes his own luck.

31:07.565 --> 31:09.430
No.

31:10.501 --> 31:13.371
What did he do to make two wives die?

31:14.171 --> 31:15.974
Nothing.

31:16.374 --> 31:18.606
I agree with you.

31:26.217 --> 31:29.283
Do you have a wife or children?

31:32.190 --> 31:34.522
Do you plan to?

31:36.928 --> 31:39.460
Well, you never know, right?

31:48.707 --> 31:51.877
- Have you ever sailed on a boat?
- Yes, I have.

31:51.977 --> 31:55.746
- Is it scary?
- It can be terrifying.

31:55.846 --> 31:58.329
But mostly it's thrilling.

32:07.191 --> 32:09.924
My father sailed on a boat once.

32:12.697 --> 32:15.663
He said he got caught in a storm at sea.

32:16.034 --> 32:18.499
He said it was a nightmare.

32:20.505 --> 32:24.172
Everything outside of our world
is scary to him.

35:40.338 --> 35:44.104
My father says once my mother
is buried here that we cannot leave.

35:46.911 --> 35:50.210
He says a grave ties a man
to the land forever.

35:54.085 --> 35:57.246
Do you think I'm selfish
because I don't want to live here?

35:57.346 --> 35:58.828
No.

35:59.358 --> 36:02.222
My father has lived here his whole life...

36:02.660 --> 36:05.459
and he's lived it the way he wanted to.

36:06.531 --> 36:09.463
But now it's my turn. Men take turns.

36:13.971 --> 36:16.374
I am not a bad son.

36:16.774 --> 36:18.806
I'm not.

36:29.220 --> 36:32.052
I am not a bad son!

36:34.024 --> 36:37.591
I am not a bad son!

36:38.959 --> 36:41.628
I'm not a bad son!

36:49.707 --> 36:53.040
I am not a bad son!

39:02.006 --> 39:03.438
<i>Rabbi?</i>

39:05.609 --> 39:07.507
Rabbi!

39:08.679 --> 39:10.978
It hurts.

39:12.883 --> 39:15.586
I want it to be over.

39:15.886 --> 39:18.419
I'm not afraid of death.

39:19.057 --> 39:23.924
I'm only scared of being alone
when I get there.

39:25.162 --> 39:27.695
You will not be alone.

39:29.399 --> 39:31.834
None of us is alone.

39:40.110 --> 39:43.925
Find better words, Yeshua.
You must work at that.

39:44.314 --> 39:46.684
Intention is good, but...

39:46.784 --> 39:49.850
often the words are hollow and useless.

39:50.521 --> 39:52.790
Or better still...

39:52.890 --> 39:55.125
find an action.

39:55.225 --> 39:57.091
Yes.

39:57.761 --> 40:00.460
Action over words. Always.

40:01.932 --> 40:04.331
Otherwise, silence.

41:57.181 --> 41:59.980
You think you are his only child?

42:02.552 --> 42:04.885
There are others.

42:07.224 --> 42:09.122
No.

42:09.827 --> 42:12.226
There is only me.

42:14.398 --> 42:16.897
There is only me.

42:36.820 --> 42:39.353
Look in on your mother.

42:54.405 --> 42:58.075
Did the boy speak with you
when you went to the water?

42:58.175 --> 43:00.240
A little.

43:05.182 --> 43:09.088
I don't know how to talk to him.
The words get caught in my throat.

43:09.188 --> 43:14.258
I fight to push them through
and they come out harsh.

43:14.358 --> 43:17.018
I suppose he thinks I'm angry at him.

43:19.162 --> 43:21.528
He doesn't know me...

43:22.399 --> 43:24.932
and I don't know him.

43:32.209 --> 43:35.530
Any words of advice, holy man?

43:37.381 --> 43:40.597
Talk to him about something
that he's interested in.

43:41.919 --> 43:44.384
What is he interested in?

43:47.190 --> 43:48.894
Riddles.

43:48.994 --> 43:51.879
He makes up a very good riddle.

43:54.965 --> 43:57.161
I don't like riddles.

44:13.817 --> 44:17.488
That shooting star last night.
You enjoyed that.

44:17.588 --> 44:20.191
- It was a bore.
- Liar.

44:20.291 --> 44:23.322
I am a liar. That is the truth.

44:27.064 --> 44:30.367
I've seen every shooting star
since the first one.

44:30.467 --> 44:33.100
Every flash of lightning.

44:33.370 --> 44:37.074
I've heard the last gasp
of each thing that ever lived.

44:37.174 --> 44:39.477
Nothing's interesting anymore.

44:39.577 --> 44:43.243
Nothing surprises you? Not a thing?

44:48.218 --> 44:50.654
The repetitiveness.

44:50.754 --> 44:55.928
The obstinate, dull repetitiveness of your
father's plan is bewildering to me.

44:56.228 --> 45:00.964
The same lives lived over
and over and over and over again.

45:01.064 --> 45:03.201
Is there a plan?

45:03.301 --> 45:07.594
It all has to turn into something, it has to
pour out into something, but into what?

45:08.305 --> 45:11.004
And that's my weakness...

45:11.875 --> 45:14.241
curiosity.

45:16.280 --> 45:19.549
But I'll stay as long
as it takes, forever...

45:19.649 --> 45:21.685
to witness the end.

45:21.785 --> 45:24.534
The final sunset. If there is one.

45:25.956 --> 45:29.995
Maybe on that day,
late in the afternoon, seconds away,

45:30.095 --> 45:32.896
he'll want to start it all over again...

45:32.996 --> 45:35.065
from the beginning.

45:35.165 --> 45:39.738
He's done it before. Recreated
the whole thing, retold the whole thing.

45:39.838 --> 45:42.924
On a whim. With little differences
that must mean the world to him,

45:43.024 --> 45:45.210
a branch that crooks
in a different direction,

45:45.310 --> 45:49.009
one egg more or less
in the nest of a flea.

45:49.480 --> 45:52.329
What a self-centered...

45:52.429 --> 45:55.007
self-indulgent creature he is. Isn't he?

45:55.107 --> 45:58.752
Deaf-mute. Insatiable.

45:59.690 --> 46:02.593
These things he expects of you.

46:02.693 --> 46:05.062
Do you think anyone will care?

46:05.162 --> 46:08.061
Men of 1,000 years from now?

46:17.891 --> 46:20.857
What's it like to be in his presence?

46:25.983 --> 46:28.348
Is there a face?

46:28.918 --> 46:30.751
No.

46:32.656 --> 46:34.488
There is no face.

46:36.726 --> 46:39.192
There is no face.

46:40.898 --> 46:43.797
There's a thing that swallows you.

46:45.369 --> 46:49.770
It holds you together while it's
tearing you apart and it's terrifying.

46:50.607 --> 46:53.477
It makes you feel worthless...

46:53.577 --> 46:56.576
and it makes you want to be worthless.

46:59.149 --> 47:03.617
And all the while, it makes you believe
that you and he are one and the same...

47:04.789 --> 47:08.222
That... that is...

47:12.663 --> 47:15.262
Well, that can be quite confusing.

47:22.874 --> 47:25.010
That's how I remember it, anyway.

47:25.110 --> 47:28.613
It's been a million years since he
so much as looked in my direction.

47:28.713 --> 47:33.480
- Your pride made him angry.
- I'm not proud. I am not proud.

47:34.217 --> 47:36.750
He's the proud one.

47:40.824 --> 47:43.995
- How's our little wager going?
- I do not wager.

47:44.095 --> 47:47.126
Oh, dear me, course not.

47:54.838 --> 47:58.275
- What?
- You already know the outcome, don't you?

47:58.375 --> 48:02.380
- No. Not at all.
- Yes. Yes, you do.

48:02.480 --> 48:04.716
I am able to do that generally, yes.

48:04.816 --> 48:09.382
But when it comes to you
and your little things, not always.

48:14.091 --> 48:17.955
I could tell you what would've happened if
you'd passed by this place a moment earlier.

48:20.330 --> 48:22.695
Would you like to know?

48:27.537 --> 48:30.266
The boy would not have met you.

48:31.075 --> 48:33.143
After the mother's death,

48:33.243 --> 48:36.580
his relationship
with the father deteriorates.

48:36.680 --> 48:41.381
He puts up with it for several years,
expecting that the father will not live long.

48:42.152 --> 48:48.125
Eventually, he poisons the father
and is hanged for it.

48:48.225 --> 48:52.230
Along the way, the boy
has a son who remains here.

48:52.330 --> 48:55.262
Like the grandfather, he loves the desert.

48:57.367 --> 48:59.769
That's how it would have been this time.

49:00.539 --> 49:03.775
In previous tellings of the world,
it was all a little different.

49:03.875 --> 49:07.708
Sometimes it was nothing but love
between the father and the son.

49:09.680 --> 49:13.013
That's how your father amuses himself.

49:16.920 --> 49:19.723
Now it's your turn to take a hand.

49:19.823 --> 49:22.222
Can you do any better?

49:36.106 --> 49:38.341
Why do you live here?

49:38.441 --> 49:41.679
Because the desert is ruthless.

49:41.779 --> 49:45.517
It strips you of your vanities,
your illusions, and...

49:45.617 --> 49:49.487
gives you the opportunity
to see yourself for who you are.

49:50.087 --> 49:52.624
Isn't that why you're here?

49:52.724 --> 49:57.991
Because your god speaks louder here?

49:58.829 --> 50:02.128
God speaks wherever a man wants to listen.

50:08.672 --> 50:10.675
What I said to you about my son...

50:10.775 --> 50:13.744
It doesn't matter that we don't talk.

50:13.844 --> 50:15.880
We're not women.

50:15.980 --> 50:19.045
A father talks through example.

50:22.820 --> 50:25.719
He's the best boy in the world.

50:28.459 --> 50:31.558
Too good, perhaps.

50:38.201 --> 50:42.140
Do you see that?
The smooth rock jutting out.

50:42.240 --> 50:44.242
- Just below the crack there.
- The reddish rock?

50:44.342 --> 50:47.378
Yes. That's Jasper stone. I'm sure of it.

50:47.478 --> 50:50.048
I need a sample to take to market.

50:50.148 --> 50:54.218
- I would share any profits with you.
- No, that wouldn't be necessary.

50:54.318 --> 50:58.956
I can't in good conscience allow you
to do more work for nothing.

50:59.056 --> 51:02.489
If you don't want the money,
you give it to the poor.

51:02.960 --> 51:05.558
How would you go about it?

51:12.636 --> 51:14.971
It would take three people.

51:15.071 --> 51:17.274
Two to lower the third.

51:17.374 --> 51:21.100
Yes, that's right.
You and I would lower the boy.

51:21.200 --> 51:23.380
Just to pick at the rock.

51:23.480 --> 51:27.981
And if it's all that I think it is,
I will return with laborers and dig deep.

51:29.920 --> 51:33.019
It could change the course of our lives.

51:35.358 --> 51:38.322
The boy's life, anyway.

52:04.854 --> 52:06.657
I feel better.

52:06.757 --> 52:10.809
You do? Good. That's good.

52:20.504 --> 52:23.836
My mother had this when she was my age.

52:23.973 --> 52:26.806
And then she was fine.

52:44.494 --> 52:47.964
My father, my sisters and I...

52:48.064 --> 52:51.297
once spent a night in Jaffa.

52:51.399 --> 52:53.870
Did I tell you this already?

52:53.970 --> 52:56.335
Tell me again.

52:57.440 --> 53:00.874
My father's cousin put us up by the port.

53:01.678 --> 53:04.114
I could barely sleep...

53:04.214 --> 53:07.246
with the sounds of the city...

53:07.417 --> 53:10.083
dogs barking...

53:10.687 --> 53:13.557
music from a wedding...

53:13.957 --> 53:16.923
men quarreling...

53:17.827 --> 53:20.626
a pig brought to slaughter...

53:21.865 --> 53:24.697
a drunk woman laughing.

53:25.635 --> 53:28.167
And the smells...

53:31.040 --> 53:35.041
pepper, cedar wood...

53:35.879 --> 53:37.844
garum.

53:54.230 --> 53:57.029
If you're ever there...

53:58.101 --> 54:00.100
you think of me.

54:01.438 --> 54:03.770
Yes. I will.

54:22.058 --> 54:26.450
I took her to doctors,
brought doctors to her.

54:26.898 --> 54:31.917
Magicians, quacks. I tried them all.

54:34.387 --> 54:36.953
She's going to die, holy man.

54:37.574 --> 54:40.807
There is nothing to be done about her.

54:43.096 --> 54:46.205
When her eyes close for the last time...

54:47.601 --> 54:50.991
our whole world will come
to an end forever.

54:53.189 --> 54:56.718
It's stunning, isn't it?

54:57.961 --> 55:00.760
That life ends.

55:03.500 --> 55:06.065
You will meet again.

55:13.476 --> 55:15.580
We will have been here together.

55:15.680 --> 55:18.478
And we leave the boy behind.

55:19.916 --> 55:22.381
That'll have to do.

56:40.930 --> 56:43.963
How far can a man walk into the desert?

56:45.334 --> 56:47.138
Only halfway.

56:47.238 --> 56:49.835
After that, he's walking out.

56:59.382 --> 57:01.952
When you leave,
you could take me with you.

57:02.052 --> 57:03.888
I could pass for your son.

57:04.188 --> 57:06.824
That would be believable, wouldn't it?

57:06.924 --> 57:10.026
Believable, yes, but nevertheless a lie.

57:10.126 --> 57:11.729
But a lie that wouldn't hurt anyone.

57:11.829 --> 57:14.381
My mother and father
wouldn't be there to hear it.

57:14.481 --> 57:17.246
A lie hurts the person who tells it.

57:23.339 --> 57:27.578
You could adopt me.
That way it wouldn't be a lie.

57:27.678 --> 57:30.910
The Romans do it all the time,
adopt each other.

57:40.390 --> 57:43.322
Have you found what you
were looking for out here?

57:46.629 --> 57:49.495
Yes. Yes, I have.

57:50.500 --> 57:52.999
What were you looking for?

57:56.106 --> 57:59.972
I was looking for a place to reflect
and to pray in peace.

58:01.611 --> 58:04.877
A place to look inward and to find myself.

58:08.351 --> 58:11.015
I walk out there, too.

58:13.389 --> 58:15.493
Sometimes when I'm out there,

58:15.593 --> 58:18.491
I feel this thing rising inside of me,

58:19.429 --> 58:22.717
that I am everything
and that everything is me.

58:23.500 --> 58:26.699
That I will always be alive. Forever.

58:29.839 --> 58:34.043
And it's very conceited,
I know, to feel that way.

58:34.143 --> 58:36.742
I'm ashamed of that feeling.

59:13.416 --> 59:16.553
Some wine, holy man?

59:16.653 --> 59:18.718
No. Thank you.

59:26.462 --> 59:29.929
Boy. Boy.

01:00:40.503 --> 01:00:43.106
You are an easy target.

01:00:43.206 --> 01:00:45.738
Because you're weak.

01:01:04.861 --> 01:01:08.039
- How's your mother doing?
- She's feeling better.

01:01:08.139 --> 01:01:10.729
She thinks it's passing.

01:01:18.307 --> 01:01:20.806
Take your knife, boy.

01:01:28.551 --> 01:01:31.117
Just in case.

01:02:39.022 --> 01:02:41.759
If I had fallen behind like that,

01:02:41.859 --> 01:02:45.624
my father would have caned me
on the soles of my feet.

01:03:03.712 --> 01:03:05.544
Come.

01:03:23.032 --> 01:03:27.338
I am stronger than 10 men...

01:03:27.438 --> 01:03:31.937
and I am taller than 10 men,
but a boy can carry me.

01:03:32.274 --> 01:03:34.573
What am I?

01:03:36.713 --> 01:03:39.078
It's a riddle.

01:03:41.751 --> 01:03:43.921
I am stronger than 10 men,

01:03:44.021 --> 01:03:47.499
I'm longer than 10 men,
and a boy can carry me.

01:03:47.599 --> 01:03:49.822
What am I?

01:03:56.299 --> 01:03:58.531
A rope.

01:04:00.402 --> 01:04:02.328
It's a rope.

01:04:43.312 --> 01:04:45.211
Come.

01:04:45.948 --> 01:04:47.846
Come.

01:04:50.369 --> 01:04:52.539
Do you see that piece of rock?

01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:55.343
The holy man and I
will lower you with rope.

01:04:55.443 --> 01:04:59.975
All you have to do is chisel out a piece
and we'll pull you back up.

01:05:01.096 --> 01:05:02.995
No.

01:05:05.001 --> 01:05:07.803
No. I'm not going down there.

01:05:07.903 --> 01:05:10.135
You will.

01:05:11.107 --> 01:05:14.044
No. You know I'm afraid
of falling from high places.

01:05:14.144 --> 01:05:16.775
That is precisely why you will do it.

01:05:17.546 --> 01:05:20.334
I will not do it!
I'm not going down there!

01:05:20.434 --> 01:05:23.187
You will not disobey me.
You will regret it.

01:05:23.287 --> 01:05:27.239
He knows I'm scared to death of heights.
What kind of father asks me to do this?

01:05:29.693 --> 01:05:32.168
Please. Please, let him go.
Let him go. I can go down.

01:05:32.268 --> 01:05:34.993
I'll do it. I'll do it.

01:06:17.873 --> 01:06:20.406
I will go down myself.

01:06:20.877 --> 01:06:25.644
Do you think it can be done?
Just you and the boy to hold the ropes?

01:06:30.552 --> 01:06:32.151
Yes.

01:09:23.992 --> 01:09:25.853
Boy!

01:09:26.228 --> 01:09:30.006
Cut yourself from the rope.
You too, holy man.

01:09:30.367 --> 01:09:33.665
I'll only drag you over if I slip again.

01:10:48.544 --> 01:10:50.443
No!

01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:13.788
What is it?

01:12:16.865 --> 01:12:19.797
What is it? What is it?

01:14:37.873 --> 01:14:40.838
I don't want my mother
to see him like this.

01:16:12.134 --> 01:16:14.999
He looks so much smaller now, doesn't he?

01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:53.782
You are a good son.

01:18:36.344 --> 01:18:38.447
Your son loves you.

01:18:38.547 --> 01:18:40.784
Your son loves you.

01:18:40.884 --> 01:18:44.616
Your son loves you.
He is your son and he loves you.

01:19:16.218 --> 01:19:19.350
Am I expected to just walk away now?

01:19:20.939 --> 01:19:23.771
As if I'd never met these people?

01:19:24.592 --> 01:19:27.223
As if they mean nothing to me?

01:20:37.933 --> 01:20:39.798
Mother!

01:20:42.203 --> 01:20:44.069
Mother!

01:24:15.983 --> 01:24:17.882
Go.

01:24:18.753 --> 01:24:21.152
Please, go.

01:24:34.436 --> 01:24:38.808
If I leave here without a blessing,
I won't make it one night out there.

01:24:38.908 --> 01:24:42.710
A boy needs his father's permission
to become a man.

01:24:42.810 --> 01:24:44.976
It's perverse, isn't it?

01:24:54.522 --> 01:24:57.189
Love God above all things.

01:25:00.395 --> 01:25:02.727
Love life.

01:25:41.369 --> 01:25:42.838
Show me his destiny.

01:25:42.938 --> 01:25:45.803
- Yeshua...
- Show me now!

01:26:16.838 --> 01:26:20.442
You could have pulled the father up
and seven heavier men if you'd wanted to.

01:26:20.542 --> 01:26:22.773
That's nonsense.

01:26:29.951 --> 01:26:32.363
No. She's mine!

01:27:26.607 --> 01:27:28.506
No.

01:27:52.333 --> 01:27:55.065
Who the hell do you think you are?

01:28:45.853 --> 01:28:48.352
This is it for me.

01:28:50.075 --> 01:28:53.207
You didn't think I was going
to walk you all the way, did you?

01:28:53.728 --> 01:28:55.830
Why here?

01:28:56.230 --> 01:28:58.529
My feet hurt.

01:29:17.252 --> 01:29:19.355
I'll come to you in the end.

01:29:19.455 --> 01:29:22.452
And if you give me a sign
I'll help you down...

01:29:22.552 --> 01:29:24.853
and you can stay.

01:29:37.088 --> 01:29:39.620
Give my regards to the old man.
