00:05.280 --> 00:08.562
Goodnight, Dan.
Be careful going home now.

00:13.613 --> 00:17.026
Boy, that guy
sure chewed your ear off, Coach.

00:17.155 --> 00:20.153
Yeah, but what a nice guy.
You know something?

00:20.280 --> 00:24.736
That's the first person l ever met
that was on the Titanic.

00:24.863 --> 00:28.146
- He survived the Titanic?
- l forgot to ask.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.732
l would've loved to hear that story.

00:32.863 --> 00:38.232
l figured you'd heard it. Big boat,
hit an iceberg. Bang! Down it went.

00:39.113 --> 00:44.447
Any interesting stories, call me.
lt's one of the joys of bartending.

00:44.572 --> 00:48.068
You want interesting?
Forget the Titanic. Come here.

00:48.197 --> 00:51.693
Glen, tell him
what you told me earlier. Go ahead.

00:51.822 --> 00:55.401
l know all the words
to the <i>Bonanza</i> theme song.

00:58.197 --> 00:59.606
Go ahead. Let him hear it.

00:59.780 --> 01:03.987
<i>We got a right</i>
<i>To pick a little fight</i>, <i>Bonanza!</i>

01:04.113 --> 01:08.273
<i>lf anyone fights any one of us</i>
<i>He's gotta fight with me</i>

01:08.405 --> 01:11.735
<i>We're not a one</i>
<i>To settle up and run</i>, <i>Bonanza!</i>

01:11.863 --> 01:15.560
<i>Any one of us starts a little fight</i>
<i>Knows he can trust on me</i>

01:15.697 --> 01:19.607
<i>One for four</i>, <i>four for one</i>,
<i>This we guarantee</i>

01:19.738 --> 01:21.480
<i>One for four</i>, <i>four for one...</i>

02:36.113 --> 02:38.353
- Howdy, sports fans.
- Norm!

02:39.447 --> 02:42.528
- What'll it be, Norm?
- Fame, fortune, fast women.

02:42.655 --> 02:44.445
Yeah? How about a beer?

02:44.572 --> 02:46.941
Even better.

02:47.072 --> 02:49.027
How's the search for work, Norm?

02:49.155 --> 02:52.770
Good news, everybody.
l'm no longer looking for a job.

02:54.488 --> 02:56.396
l'm now begging for one.

03:02.572 --> 03:04.895
- l don't believe this.
- What now?

03:06.322 --> 03:10.944
That was my mother. She just flew
into town and she's coming here.

03:11.072 --> 03:13.062
No kidding.
We finally get to meet her.

03:13.197 --> 03:16.894
- This is very strange.
- That you have a mother?

03:18.238 --> 03:19.648
No.

03:19.780 --> 03:22.944
That you have a mother
that wants to see you?

03:23.072 --> 03:25.643
No. That she's coming over here.

03:25.780 --> 03:29.062
l didn't think Mommy'd be caught dead
in a place like this.

03:29.197 --> 03:31.685
What are we, too grungy or something?

03:31.822 --> 03:35.022
Yeah, inside an hour ago,
l'm in the tub.

03:36.197 --> 03:39.397
You're taking this too personally.
You shouldn't.

03:39.530 --> 03:44.187
- lt's just Mommy doesn't like bars.
- Bars can be very sad places.

03:44.322 --> 03:47.106
Some people
spend their whole lives in a bar.

03:47.238 --> 03:51.279
Just yesterday, some guy sat
right here next to me for 1 1 hours.

03:56.530 --> 04:00.227
- What kind of a life is that?
- Pitiful.

04:00.363 --> 04:03.563
The sad thing is,
he'll be sitting in a bar right now,

04:03.697 --> 04:06.564
drinking a beer,
going on and on about nothing.

04:07.988 --> 04:11.816
Diane, if your mom is anything
like you, everyone will love her.

04:11.947 --> 04:13.653
She's nothing like l am.

04:13.780 --> 04:17.358
She's very eccentric
and a little hard to take at times.

04:17.488 --> 04:19.976
Yeah, worlds apart.

04:22.780 --> 04:27.105
Diane, if your mother's so rich,
how come you're not?

04:28.613 --> 04:33.899
l didn't want to go through life
being handed money on a silver tray.

04:34.655 --> 04:36.693
For you.

04:37.988 --> 04:39.813
Thank you.

04:43.197 --> 04:45.732
There she is. My little baby.

04:45.863 --> 04:47.735
Mommy.

04:49.655 --> 04:51.480
Hello, darling.

04:55.488 --> 05:00.441
They didn't get near each other.
How can anyone miss Diane's mouth?

05:01.238 --> 05:04.402
So, this is a bar.

05:05.238 --> 05:07.525
Yes. This is where l work.

05:10.447 --> 05:13.361
Let me introduce you.
Mother, this is Sam,

05:13.488 --> 05:18.027
who wouldn't say anything to
embarrass me, so wisely says nothing.

05:18.155 --> 05:19.648
How do you do?

05:19.780 --> 05:21.486
Hi.

05:21.613 --> 05:26.271
This is Carla Tortelli. She says even
less than Sam and she's very busy.

05:26.405 --> 05:29.403
Down there we have Norman
and his friend Cliff.

05:29.530 --> 05:32.314
They lost their tongues in the war.

05:34.447 --> 05:37.231
Ernie Pantusso.
You can call him Coach.

05:37.363 --> 05:40.278
- Or use my other nickname, Red.
- Red?

05:40.405 --> 05:43.189
As a player,
his team-mates called him Red.

05:43.322 --> 05:45.526
Because your hair was red?

05:45.655 --> 05:48.357
No, ma'am. Because l read a book.

05:51.947 --> 05:54.613
He's very sweet though. Very sweet.

05:54.738 --> 05:57.606
lt's nice to finally meet you,
Mrs Chambers.

05:57.738 --> 06:01.814
lt's nice to meet you, Sam.
Diane's told me about you.

06:01.947 --> 06:05.857
You're almost as handsome
as she says you think you are.

06:10.072 --> 06:12.690
There's a compliment
in there someplace.

06:13.488 --> 06:16.059
lt's very nice of you
to come all this way.

06:16.197 --> 06:20.143
l thought so, too,
but you know what tomorrow is?

06:20.280 --> 06:24.570
- No. What?
- Your wedding day. Congratulations.

06:27.363 --> 06:28.560
My what?

06:28.697 --> 06:31.185
lf you're not married
before tomorrow,

06:31.322 --> 06:33.775
l lose my share
of your father's estate.

06:33.905 --> 06:36.191
My God! Why?

06:36.322 --> 06:40.647
Darling, when he died,
you were still a little gawky girl,

06:40.780 --> 06:45.236
with your nose in a book
and a terrible facial tic.

06:46.530 --> 06:52.313
Your father was worried
that you would never find a mate,

06:52.447 --> 06:54.603
and that you would have
a lonely life.

06:54.738 --> 06:59.396
So he made me promise
that l would have you married

06:59.530 --> 07:03.145
ten years after the day he died.

07:03.280 --> 07:04.773
He even put it in his will.

07:04.905 --> 07:08.235
So, if you're still single,
l'm cut off.

07:09.030 --> 07:12.609
Why have you waited to tell me?
Father's been dead ten years.

07:12.738 --> 07:16.186
You know how time flies
when you're having...

07:18.197 --> 07:20.234
- Grief.
- Grief.

07:23.613 --> 07:26.481
So, if l'm not married by tomorrow,
you're broke?

07:26.613 --> 07:29.102
Put your mind at ease.
l'll never be broke.

07:29.238 --> 07:33.184
l'll either be rich or dead.
The choice is yours.

07:35.613 --> 07:38.149
You're seriously asking me
to get married?

07:38.280 --> 07:43.151
My attorneys have assured me
that it need be in name only,

07:43.280 --> 07:45.685
just for a few days.
There's no other way.

07:48.197 --> 07:50.650
This is the craziest thing
Father ever did.

07:50.780 --> 07:52.936
Not even close, dear.

07:55.780 --> 07:59.821
Excuse me, madam.
l dropped the bags off at the hotel.

07:59.947 --> 08:02.316
- Thank you.
- Nice to see you, Boggs.

08:02.447 --> 08:05.196
l'd be honoured
if you'd consent to be my wife.

08:08.405 --> 08:11.072
l said ''in a pinch'', Boggs.

08:11.197 --> 08:14.195
- Now wait over there.
- Yes, madam.

08:14.697 --> 08:17.944
Darling, think hard.
There's so little time.

08:18.072 --> 08:22.018
Don't you know anyone who'd be
willing to marry you for a few days?

08:22.155 --> 08:26.647
Well, l'm afraid there's no one
l'm steadily dating at the moment.

08:26.780 --> 08:28.273
Excuse me,...

08:29.447 --> 08:31.484
..rich lady.

08:32.363 --> 08:35.196
l couldn't help overhearing
your problems.

08:35.322 --> 08:37.940
Your daughter has a hot thing
for the bartender.

08:38.072 --> 08:40.607
l do not!

08:41.530 --> 08:43.568
She likes Red?

08:46.530 --> 08:48.900
He's dumb enough to be your father.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.321
Not him. Sam.

08:51.447 --> 08:54.314
l care nothing. l feel nothing.

08:54.447 --> 08:56.272
Sam who?

08:57.447 --> 09:00.859
Come off it. We've all noticed
how you two go around,

09:00.988 --> 09:05.196
looking at each other
like lovesick cows. Admit it.

09:05.322 --> 09:08.154
He's got you
steaming under the silks.

09:11.113 --> 09:16.020
- This happens to be my mother.
- That's why l'm being delicate.

09:16.988 --> 09:21.064
Diane, is this true?
How about the two of you?

09:21.197 --> 09:22.938
l'd rather marry Boggs.

09:23.072 --> 09:25.228
l could make you very happy.

09:28.197 --> 09:30.520
Sorry, Boggs.
Just a figure of speech.

09:30.655 --> 09:32.313
Thank you, miss.

09:32.863 --> 09:35.316
Diane, he's not a bad-looking fellow.

09:35.447 --> 09:40.436
His cologne's an affront to society
but what harm would it do to ask?

09:40.572 --> 09:41.981
Mother, no.

09:43.197 --> 09:45.436
Darling, please.

09:45.572 --> 09:49.518
l wish l was as strong as you are,
but l'm not.

09:49.655 --> 09:53.565
Without money,
l don't think l can make it.

09:57.363 --> 10:00.196
Alright, l'll ask him. Sam?

10:01.530 --> 10:04.149
- What?
- May l speak with you a moment?

10:09.863 --> 10:13.276
- l might as well come to the point.
- That'd be nice.

10:13.405 --> 10:15.360
Would you be willing to marry me?

10:15.988 --> 10:19.401
Boy, this cologne
must be doing its stuff.

10:25.488 --> 10:29.897
You see, my very eccentric father

10:30.363 --> 10:33.776
put a very strange clause
into his will.

10:33.905 --> 10:38.895
Providing that if l'm not married
by tomorrow,

10:39.030 --> 10:41.945
my mother will become destitute.

10:42.072 --> 10:46.694
So, if we could get married, just
long enough to satisfy the attorneys,

10:46.822 --> 10:51.147
it would really help her out
and l would consider it a favour.

10:51.280 --> 10:54.977
l'd consider it a joke.
Marriage and me do not mix.

10:55.113 --> 10:58.479
No, it's not marriage.
lt's a business arrangement.

10:58.613 --> 11:02.310
Just for a couple of days
and then we'll get divorced.

11:02.447 --> 11:05.563
Listen, l've been married before.
You haven't.

11:05.697 --> 11:08.363
Take my word,
marriage changes people.

11:08.488 --> 11:13.062
No woman in the world can hear those
words and not start believing it.

11:13.197 --> 11:15.650
That's a very sexist thing to say.

11:15.780 --> 11:19.441
No, it's not sexist
because no man can resist it either.

11:21.113 --> 11:24.360
Why, Sam,
that's a very romantic thing to say.

11:25.863 --> 11:28.980
The difference is, with men,
they get over it in an hour.

11:29.113 --> 11:32.111
With women, it goes on for years.

11:33.863 --> 11:37.027
lf you're worried about me,
l'm only doing this for my mother.

11:37.155 --> 11:38.269
Yeah, right.

11:38.405 --> 11:43.062
l promise you that l will not feel
any emotions toward you.

11:43.197 --> 11:47.522
l learned a long time ago never to
trust anybody wearing a wedding gown,

11:47.655 --> 11:49.313
especially a woman.

11:50.072 --> 11:51.897
Forget l asked.

11:52.572 --> 11:55.238
- l'm sorry.
- Never mind.

11:56.113 --> 11:57.820
l'm sorry, Mommy. He said no.

11:57.947 --> 12:00.021
Oh, dear.

12:03.488 --> 12:05.064
Hell.

12:07.572 --> 12:10.274
- OK, Diane.
- OK what?

12:11.113 --> 12:13.946
OK, we'll... get married.

12:14.655 --> 12:16.978
- Really?
- Yeah. You bet.

12:18.238 --> 12:21.071
Mr Malone, how wonderful.

12:23.447 --> 12:25.437
You're both wonderful.

12:25.572 --> 12:27.313
Thank you very much.

12:27.988 --> 12:30.358
l'm still rich. l'll get the Justice.

12:30.488 --> 12:32.526
Come along, Boggs.

12:37.780 --> 12:42.023
- Thanks for changing your mind.
- You're welcome. l wanted to help.

12:42.988 --> 12:46.022
- What you're doing is very noble.
- Thank you.

12:47.447 --> 12:50.398
Where do you want to go
on our honeymoon?

12:53.697 --> 12:55.071
l should've known.

12:55.197 --> 12:59.356
As usual, Mr Malone
has his brains caught in his zipper.

13:21.613 --> 13:23.687
ls this the first wedding
in Cheers?

13:23.822 --> 13:26.903
No, Frankie Flaherty
got married in this bar.

13:27.030 --> 13:32.102
He met Janet in that corner, proposed
to her here, right in front of me,

13:32.238 --> 13:35.569
they married there,
had their first fight by the piano,

13:35.697 --> 13:40.401
she caught him in the poolroom with
a woman, shot him dead in the alley.

13:40.530 --> 13:43.481
That's an incredible story.

13:43.613 --> 13:46.944
- Want to know where he's buried?
- Where?

13:47.072 --> 13:49.027
He ain't. He's cremated.

13:50.072 --> 13:52.738
- Thank God!
- Here's his ashes.

13:57.572 --> 14:00.486
- We've got the licence.
- What took you so long?

14:00.613 --> 14:05.022
While l was there, l paid my
water bill and registered my bicycle.

14:05.155 --> 14:07.478
Know what they ask
for a bicycle licence?

14:07.613 --> 14:11.275
- Sam, shut up.
- Sorry, dear.

14:13.405 --> 14:17.315
l'd like to introduce you
to Mr Harrison Fiedler,

14:17.447 --> 14:20.445
Justice of the Peace,
who will perform the ceremony.

14:20.572 --> 14:23.902
- Hi, Just.
- We need witnesses.

14:24.030 --> 14:27.443
Yep. Every accident
needs some witnesses.

14:27.572 --> 14:31.068
Sammy, please, l'd be proud
to be your best man.

14:31.197 --> 14:32.855
l'm honoured. Thank you.

14:32.988 --> 14:36.852
The day Diane walked in,
l knew you'd get together.

14:36.988 --> 14:39.062
Coach, this is just temporary.

14:39.197 --> 14:41.483
l knew that, too.

14:43.655 --> 14:46.060
How come you never got married?

14:46.197 --> 14:51.696
Well, Norm, Coach, it's unfair to ask
a woman to be the wife of a mailman.

14:52.363 --> 14:55.859
Watching him get up every morning,
strapping on that mailbag,

14:55.988 --> 15:00.646
hitting those mean streets, never
knowing if he's coming back or not.

15:01.238 --> 15:05.232
Right. Somewhere out there
is a beagle with your name on it.

15:09.030 --> 15:12.111
Excuse me. l think we should begin.

15:12.238 --> 15:13.779
Are you ready, Mr Fiedler?

15:13.905 --> 15:17.105
l'm ready. May l have the licence?

15:19.238 --> 15:21.478
The groom's name is Schwinn?

15:22.363 --> 15:24.401
That's my bicycle licence.

15:26.530 --> 15:27.939
Excuse me.

15:28.072 --> 15:31.354
Diane, do you think
we could we lose the aprons?

15:31.488 --> 15:33.278
The aprons. Carla, the apron.

15:33.405 --> 15:36.901
Gee, l didn't know
it was going to be this formal.

15:41.530 --> 15:43.770
- Are you OK?
- Fine.

15:44.447 --> 15:48.144
Just a business arrangement.
l do appreciate it for Mommy's sake.

15:48.280 --> 15:51.693
You're welcome.
Just remember, no emotions.

15:52.780 --> 15:57.319
lf l feel anything romantic,
l will run screaming from the room.

15:57.447 --> 15:59.816
And l will clear a path for you.

16:01.613 --> 16:05.026
Would the bride and groom
come forward, please?

16:05.905 --> 16:09.187
We are gathered
in the presence of these witnesses

16:09.322 --> 16:12.106
for the purpose
of uniting in matrimony

16:12.238 --> 16:14.905
Diane Chambers and Sam Malone.

16:15.030 --> 16:17.945
The contract of marriage
is most solemn

16:18.072 --> 16:20.643
and not to be entered into lightly,

16:20.780 --> 16:25.354
but thoughtfully and seriously
and with a deep realisation

16:25.488 --> 16:28.652
of its obligations
and responsibilities.

16:29.447 --> 16:32.647
Any two people
who have come to this point

16:32.780 --> 16:38.647
clearly feel the love and joy
that they find in one another

16:39.322 --> 16:43.979
can surmount whatever obstacles
lie in their path.

16:46.530 --> 16:49.896
Sam, do you take...?

16:50.697 --> 16:52.320
Do you mind?

16:53.113 --> 16:54.487
What?

16:55.697 --> 16:58.066
Never mind. l'm sorry, please go on.

16:58.197 --> 17:01.278
- Sam, do you take this woman...
- What did l do?

17:01.405 --> 17:03.479
l saw the leer.

17:03.613 --> 17:07.523
- Leer? Come on, Diane.
- Please.

17:07.655 --> 17:09.609
Please go on.

17:09.738 --> 17:12.984
Sam, do you take this woman
to be your lawful...?

17:13.113 --> 17:17.734
She's a customer in my bar.
l smiled, that's all. Go on.

17:19.030 --> 17:20.855
She's a woman.

17:21.655 --> 17:24.321
Well, l'll be darned, so she is.

17:24.863 --> 17:27.647
To have and to hold
from this time forward...

17:27.780 --> 17:30.564
- lt was just a look.
- Just a look?

17:30.697 --> 17:34.193
This is just a look.
This is what you did.

17:36.530 --> 17:38.770
Can we get on with the ceremony?

17:38.905 --> 17:41.689
- To have and to hold...
- Wait a minute.

17:42.947 --> 17:46.691
What's the big deal? You're beginning
to sound like my wife.

17:46.822 --> 17:49.145
Excuse me. We are getting married.

17:49.280 --> 17:52.527
l may not be asking for 50 years
of love, honour and obey,

17:52.655 --> 17:56.565
but it would be nice if, during
the ceremony, you didn't drool.

17:58.155 --> 17:59.945
You really are demanding.

18:00.363 --> 18:03.445
l don't understand why you're trying
to make me so crazy.

18:03.572 --> 18:05.609
l don't understand
why you chose now

18:05.738 --> 18:07.563
to demonstrate your lack of class.

18:07.697 --> 18:10.185
l'm the one doing you the favour.

18:10.322 --> 18:13.024
- Don't do me any favours.
- Children, please.

18:13.155 --> 18:16.106
Butt out, Mom. This is
the stupidest thing l ever did.

18:16.238 --> 18:19.521
Stupidest thing? There is
no stupidest thing you ever did.

18:19.655 --> 18:21.729
Everything you do is equally stupid.

18:21.863 --> 18:25.194
lncluding not throwing you out
when l saw your stupid face!

18:25.322 --> 18:28.024
- Sam, do you have the ring?
- Shut up!

18:30.530 --> 18:36.195
That's it. We're making a mockery
of marriage and it's all my fault.

18:36.322 --> 18:38.775
There'll be no wedding here today.

18:38.905 --> 18:40.896
Fine.

18:41.030 --> 18:45.024
- l hate your guts and l always will.
- That goes double for me.

18:45.155 --> 18:47.939
l understand
they wrote their own vows.

18:57.363 --> 19:02.234
You know, 30 minutes ago,
l was a wealthy woman.

19:02.363 --> 19:06.902
- Now l can't pay for these drinks.
- Don't worry. The drinks are on me.

19:07.030 --> 19:10.230
l don't want your charity
and l don't want your pity,

19:10.363 --> 19:12.852
but l will take your money.

19:14.030 --> 19:18.569
Well, if it hadn't been
for dear old Dad

19:18.697 --> 19:21.399
and his strange clause in the will,

19:21.530 --> 19:24.197
you would never
have been in this predicament.

19:24.322 --> 19:26.608
You mustn't think ill of your father.

19:26.738 --> 19:31.479
He was concerned. He loved you
very much. You know that, don't you?

19:33.822 --> 19:38.894
- Yes, l guess l do.
- ln a strange way, he loved me, too.

19:39.030 --> 19:42.312
Unfortunately,
he loved a good joke more.

19:42.447 --> 19:45.361
Spencer, wherever you are tonight,

19:45.488 --> 19:47.728
l hope you're frying.

19:52.155 --> 19:54.193
You two are still here?

19:55.488 --> 19:56.602
We'll lock up.

20:01.613 --> 20:03.770
How are you getting home?

20:05.280 --> 20:07.733
How are we getting home, Mommy?

20:07.863 --> 20:10.648
Boggs is waiting outside to drive us.

20:19.238 --> 20:20.980
l'm sorry about this afternoon.

20:24.030 --> 20:26.483
l'm sorry, too.

20:26.613 --> 20:29.019
l told you,
weddings do weird things to me.

20:29.155 --> 20:33.362
l must admit,
l got a little swept away myself.

20:35.697 --> 20:39.311
l think l owe you an apology, too,
Mrs Chambers. l'm sorry.

20:39.738 --> 20:42.653
What l asked you to do was unfair.

20:43.613 --> 20:45.651
Are you alright?

20:45.780 --> 20:50.402
Actually, l...
l'm really quite afraid.

20:53.822 --> 20:56.061
Afraid of what, Mommy?

20:56.197 --> 20:58.566
l'm afraid of being poor.

20:58.697 --> 21:00.983
l was poor before l met your father,

21:01.113 --> 21:06.315
and it took me years to really forget
how being poor felt.

21:09.238 --> 21:12.023
Excuse me, madam.
Could l have a word?

21:12.780 --> 21:16.276
- What is it, Boggs?
- l heard of your tragedy.

21:16.405 --> 21:18.894
l'd be honoured
if you'd consent to be my wife.

21:19.488 --> 21:22.901
- lt's too late for that.
- No. l meant you, madam.

21:25.363 --> 21:29.606
Why, Boggs, have you lost your mind?

21:31.655 --> 21:36.691
l mean, l've only accepted
your familiarity over the years

21:36.822 --> 21:40.022
because l was afraid
of class warfare.

21:43.072 --> 21:44.269
l am aware of that.

21:44.405 --> 21:48.269
However, in view of the developments
in the last half an hour,

21:48.405 --> 21:53.109
our stations have, shall we say,
grown a little closer.

21:53.238 --> 21:54.435
Now, then, Boggs...

21:54.572 --> 21:57.439
Madam, it so happens,

21:57.572 --> 22:00.984
l have a considerable
sum of money stashed away.

22:02.572 --> 22:04.397
Really?

22:06.113 --> 22:10.652
- Where did you get it, Boggs?
- From you and yours, madam.

22:10.780 --> 22:15.319
l've been embezzling from your family
for close to a quarter of a century.

22:19.863 --> 22:23.359
Why, Boggs, how clever of you.

22:25.488 --> 22:28.570
Exactly how much
money do you have?

22:28.697 --> 22:31.185
As l recall my Emily Post,

22:31.322 --> 22:36.062
a lady does not ask her chauffeur how
much he stole from her dead husband.

22:37.155 --> 22:40.852
Let us just say,
l am very comfortable.

22:41.822 --> 22:45.685
Shall we go to dinner
and talk about the future?

22:49.030 --> 22:50.439
<i>Bon app</i>é<i>tit.</i>

22:51.947 --> 22:56.521
You know, Boggs, l must confess,

22:56.655 --> 23:03.778
l've always found the back of
your head enormously attractive.

23:07.572 --> 23:09.609
l sensed it, madam.

23:10.280 --> 23:12.899
Would you do me a favour, madam?

23:13.030 --> 23:16.277
- What's that?
- Would you drive?

23:19.488 --> 23:21.230
Kinky.
