00:10.619 --> 00:14.579
<i>
Previously on "Fiasco"... </i>

00:14.710 --> 00:16.712
<i>While President Jimmy Carter
is engulfed </i>

00:16.842 --> 00:19.802
<i>by a hostage crisis in Iran,</i>

00:19.932 --> 00:22.196
<i>a new religious movement
in the United States </i>

00:22.326 --> 00:23.849
<i>finds traction</i>

00:23.980 --> 00:28.028
<i>and a kindred spirit
with a familiar face. </i>

00:28.158 --> 00:30.552
<i>After Carter suffers
a landslide defeat </i>

00:30.682 --> 00:34.251
<i>in his bid for a second term,
he remains determined </i>

00:34.382 --> 00:37.733
<i>to negotiate
the release of the hostages. </i>

00:37.863 --> 00:41.258
<i>But it's the newly
inaugurated President Reagan </i>

00:41.389 --> 00:43.434
<i>who welcomes them home.</i>

00:54.097 --> 00:59.059
<i>Right next door to the White
House, in Washington, D.C., </i>

00:59.189 --> 01:00.712
<i>is another building
that's never gotten </i>

01:00.843 --> 01:02.671
<i>quite as much attention.</i>

01:02.801 --> 01:04.629
The Old Executive Office
Building

01:04.760 --> 01:06.805
was built more
than 100 years prior.

01:06.936 --> 01:10.418
It was actually the Department
of the Navy

01:10.548 --> 01:13.595
and the Department of War.

01:13.725 --> 01:16.380
At the time, the National
Security Council staff

01:16.511 --> 01:20.515
was all located on the third
floor of the building.

01:20.645 --> 01:22.430
<i>The National
Security Council, </i>

01:22.560 --> 01:25.911
<i>or NSC for short,
was a body of senior advisors </i>

01:26.042 --> 01:28.827
<i>who had the President's ear
on foreign policy. </i>

01:28.958 --> 01:30.829
<i>The NSC had its own staff,</i>

01:30.960 --> 01:33.397
<i>whose job it was
to monitor world events </i>

01:33.528 --> 01:35.443
<i>and keep
the President informed </i>

01:35.573 --> 01:38.533
<i>of any incoming threats
to America's national security. </i>

01:38.663 --> 01:42.754
My office was probably
20 feet by 20 feet,

01:42.885 --> 01:46.410
with 15-foot ceilings.
I had a big sofa.

01:46.541 --> 01:49.109
I could spend the night.
I had a bar.

01:49.239 --> 01:50.719
Those were days
when you could smoke cigars

01:50.849 --> 01:52.851
in the office
and drink scotch.

01:52.982 --> 01:56.377
Oliver North's office
was not like that.

01:58.988 --> 02:01.382
Colonel North, please rise.

02:03.732 --> 02:06.648
Do you solemnly swear--

02:06.778 --> 02:08.606
<i>Before Oliver North</i>

02:08.737 --> 02:12.523
<i>became associated
with an international scandal, </i>

02:12.654 --> 02:16.701
<i>he was a little-known
junior aide on the NSC staff, </i>

02:16.832 --> 02:19.530
<i>a young Vietnam vet
with no previous experience </i>

02:19.661 --> 02:21.924
<i>as a government bureaucrat.</i>

02:22.054 --> 02:25.406
<i>Starting in 1981,
North had his own office </i>

02:25.536 --> 02:27.582
<i>in the Old Executive
Office Building. </i>

02:27.712 --> 02:29.932
<i>Room 392.</i>

02:30.062 --> 02:33.414
He was actually stuck up
in a room

02:33.544 --> 02:36.547
that was carved
out of other rooms.

02:36.678 --> 02:40.377
His office was uncomfortable,
it was hot, it was cramped.

02:42.292 --> 02:44.512
<i>Most people
in government at the time, </i>

02:44.642 --> 02:46.949
<i>even those with top secret
security clearance, </i>

02:47.079 --> 02:50.126
<i>had no idea
this room even existed. </i>

02:50.257 --> 02:52.563
Ollie had three
or four computers,

02:52.694 --> 02:55.392
four or five phones.

02:55.523 --> 02:58.874
He had more
electronic equipment

02:59.004 --> 03:04.793
than anyone else in the NSC.
It was a bit sci-fi.

03:04.923 --> 03:08.362
We're still talking 5 1/4
floppies in this time.

03:08.492 --> 03:11.930
There were no hard drives.

03:12.061 --> 03:13.802
<i>Whenever there was
a hint of danger </i>

03:13.932 --> 03:17.588
<i>anywhere in the world,
a little bell would go off, </i>

03:17.719 --> 03:22.811
<i>and some days room 392 was
filled with the din of bells. </i>

03:22.941 --> 03:25.683
North's office was definitely
a little command center,

03:25.814 --> 03:28.469
and it enabled him to have,

03:28.599 --> 03:29.818
you know,
international conversations,

03:29.948 --> 03:32.647
secure conversations,
whatever he wanted,

03:32.777 --> 03:34.518
while dealing
with three different computers

03:34.649 --> 03:36.216
at the same time.

03:38.348 --> 03:40.045
You know, it was sort
of a real-time picture

03:40.176 --> 03:42.352
of global terrorism.

03:44.789 --> 03:46.530
I came to
the National Security Council

03:46.661 --> 03:48.532
six years ago

03:48.663 --> 03:50.839
to work in the administration
of a great president.

03:50.969 --> 03:52.928
<i>How did
Oliver North find himself </i>

03:53.058 --> 03:55.800
<i>so close to the center
of American power? </i>

03:55.931 --> 03:58.020
There were many problems.

03:58.150 --> 04:02.590
Sometimes we succeeded
and sometimes we failed.

04:02.720 --> 04:03.895
<i>What was he doing</i>

04:04.026 --> 04:07.116
<i>behind the closed doors
of room 392? </i>

04:07.247 --> 04:10.467
<i>And what part did he play in
paralyzing the administration </i>

04:10.598 --> 04:12.382
<i>of a wildly popular president?</i>

04:12.513 --> 04:13.992
But at least we tried.

04:14.123 --> 04:15.994
And I want to tell you
that I for one

04:16.125 --> 04:18.388
will never regret having tried.

04:20.564 --> 04:23.088
<i>I'm Leon Neyfakh.</i>

04:23.219 --> 04:28.746
<i>This is "Fiasco,"
the story of Iran-Contra. </i>

04:52.074 --> 04:56.861
We have every right
to dream heroic dreams.

04:56.992 --> 04:58.863
Those who say
that we're in a time

04:58.994 --> 05:01.518
when there are no heroes,

05:01.649 --> 05:03.041
they just don't know
where to look.

05:03.172 --> 05:07.089
You can see heroes every day.

05:07.219 --> 05:10.614
<i>Ronald Reagan
glided into office in 1981, </i>

05:10.745 --> 05:12.529
<i>thanks in part to the missteps
of his predecessor, </i>

05:12.660 --> 05:14.357
<i>Jimmy Carter.</i>

05:14.488 --> 05:16.707
I'm told that tens of
thousands of prayer meetings

05:16.838 --> 05:18.840
are being held on this day,

05:18.970 --> 05:21.669
and for that
I'm deeply grateful.

05:21.799 --> 05:24.672
<i>But he was also really good
at playing the part. </i>

05:24.802 --> 05:27.327
We are a nation under God,

05:27.457 --> 05:29.851
and I believe God
intended for us to be free.

05:31.940 --> 05:33.637
<i>He had star quality,</i>

05:33.768 --> 05:36.771
<i>and he just came across
as presidential. </i>

05:36.901 --> 05:39.948
Reagan had this special charm
about him,

05:40.078 --> 05:41.863
this appealing factor.

05:41.993 --> 05:43.995
In this springtime of hope,

05:44.126 --> 05:47.695
some lights seem eternal.
America's is.

05:49.305 --> 05:51.002
<i>It was almost like
if it was on camera </i>

05:51.133 --> 05:53.135
<i>and you were watching him
on television, </i>

05:53.265 --> 05:54.963
you had the sense that he was
right there with you,

05:55.093 --> 05:56.704
leaning over a fence.

05:56.834 --> 05:58.967
I have a letter with me.

05:59.097 --> 06:01.752
The letter came
from Peter Sweeney.

06:01.883 --> 06:03.101
He's in the second grade,

06:03.232 --> 06:05.713
and he said,
"I hope you get well quick

06:05.843 --> 06:07.671
or you might have to make
a speech in your pajamas."

06:09.760 --> 06:12.154
The image of Ronald Reagan
that voters

06:12.284 --> 06:14.069
had probably uppermost
in their minds

06:14.199 --> 06:16.724
by the time he entered politics
in the middle of the 1960s

06:16.854 --> 06:18.813
was as a TV star.

06:18.943 --> 06:20.510
Ain't you supposed to be good
with a gun?

06:22.077 --> 06:23.992
Good enough.

06:25.689 --> 06:27.778
On Sunday nights,

06:27.909 --> 06:30.825
<i>Reagan was on the General
Electric Sunday Night Theater. </i>

06:30.955 --> 06:31.956
<i>
For General Electric, </i>

06:32.087 --> 06:34.655
<i>here is Ronald Reagan.</i>

06:34.785 --> 06:36.744
Good evening.
Tonight, Jack Benny,

06:36.874 --> 06:40.008
with Zsa Zsa Gabor, stars on
the "General Electric Theater."

06:40.138 --> 06:41.705
He was a comforting figure

06:41.836 --> 06:43.228
on your television screen
every Sunday night,

06:43.359 --> 06:44.795
on this show that was,

06:44.926 --> 06:46.188
you know,
among the most popular

06:46.318 --> 06:48.930
in the late 1950s
and early 1960s.

06:49.060 --> 06:51.106
Once upon a time
there was a girl,

06:51.236 --> 06:54.283
and of course there was a boy
who fell in love with her.

06:54.414 --> 06:57.199
<i>When Reagan decided
to make the jump to politics, </i>

06:57.329 --> 06:59.157
<i>it became clear
that he was bringing </i>

06:59.288 --> 07:01.203
<i>his acting experience
with him. </i>

07:01.333 --> 07:05.860
His acting skills were
inherent in his communication.

07:05.990 --> 07:08.732
He had a cadence
to the way he spoke.

07:08.863 --> 07:11.996
For example, he often starts
his sentences--

07:12.127 --> 07:15.391
very frequently-
by saying "Well,"

07:15.522 --> 07:17.132
and he cocks his head
a little bit.

07:17.262 --> 07:20.831
Well. Well. Well. Well. Well.

07:20.962 --> 07:22.790
He told me
that was a stage pause

07:22.920 --> 07:27.142
that allowed him
just a fraction of a second

07:27.272 --> 07:30.101
to think through how he wanted
to start the sentence.

07:30.232 --> 07:32.277
And so I actually started
writing that

07:32.408 --> 07:35.106
into his speeches.

07:35.237 --> 07:39.284
Well, now to get on
with the business at hand.

07:39.415 --> 07:42.592
<i>After an assassination
attempt in 1981... </i>

07:47.118 --> 07:50.861
<i>...Reagan showed such grace
and humility </i>

07:50.992 --> 07:53.821
<i>that his approval ratings
with both parties increased. </i>

07:53.951 --> 07:57.825
I'd like to say a few words
directly to all of you

07:57.955 --> 08:01.089
and to those who are watching
and listening tonight.

08:01.219 --> 08:05.310
The warmth of your words,
the expression of friendship,

08:05.441 --> 08:09.967
and yes, love, meant more to us
than you could ever know.

08:10.098 --> 08:12.013
<i>Amid the upheaval
of the late 1970s </i>

08:12.143 --> 08:14.145
<i>and early '80s,</i>

08:14.276 --> 08:16.887
<i>many Americans saw Reagan
as an almost mythical leader </i>

08:17.018 --> 08:19.324
<i>who would bring the country
back to a simpler time. </i>

08:19.455 --> 08:23.198
Reagan was a man
of very strong convictions,

08:23.328 --> 08:25.766
but they were also
very broad convictions.

08:25.896 --> 08:27.985
He believed
in military strength.

08:28.116 --> 08:32.903
He was fiercely anti-Soviet,
fiercely anti-communist.

08:33.034 --> 08:36.211
In his mind he was
a rescuer. He was a hero.

08:36.341 --> 08:39.780
He was gonna rescue America
from communists,

08:39.910 --> 08:41.999
from liberals, from chaos.

08:42.130 --> 08:45.568
Our forbearance should never
be misunderstood.

08:45.699 --> 08:48.005
Our reluctance for conflict
should not be misjudged

08:48.136 --> 08:50.225
as a failure of will.

08:50.355 --> 08:53.663
When action is required to
preserve our national security,

08:53.794 --> 08:55.317
we will act.

08:55.447 --> 08:59.016
<i>Reagan's convictions,
broad as they were, </i>

08:59.147 --> 09:02.846
<i>had a galvanizing effect
on the people around him. </i>

09:02.977 --> 09:05.370
<i>He knew how to make people
want to follow him </i>

09:05.501 --> 09:07.590
My name is Oliver North,

09:07.721 --> 09:10.898
lieutenant colonel of the
United States Marine Corps.

09:14.336 --> 09:16.947
The National Security Council
is, in essence,

09:17.078 --> 09:19.820
the president's staff.
It helps to formulate

09:19.950 --> 09:23.040
and coordinate
national security policy.

09:23.171 --> 09:26.174
<i>When Oliver North was
first starting out at the NSC, </i>

09:26.304 --> 09:29.090
<i>Vietnam was still fresh
on his mind. </i>

09:29.220 --> 09:32.484
Since graduating
from the Naval Academy in 1968,

09:32.615 --> 09:36.053
I have strived to be the best
Marine officer that one can be.

09:36.184 --> 09:38.099
<i>Following his graduation,</i>

09:38.229 --> 09:41.798
<i>North joined the Marine Corps
and deployed to Vietnam. </i>

09:41.929 --> 09:45.236
Ollie is an
extraordinarily patriotic man,

09:45.367 --> 09:51.025
and he is a Marine
in every fiber of his being.

09:51.155 --> 09:54.550
In combat, my goal was always
to understand the objective,

09:54.681 --> 09:57.335
follow orders,
accomplish the mission

09:57.466 --> 10:00.861
and to keep alive the men
who served under me.

10:03.211 --> 10:05.213
<i>During both
of his tours of duty, </i>

10:05.343 --> 10:07.258
<i>North wrote letters
to his family, </i>

10:07.389 --> 10:09.913
<i>updating them
about life in Vietnam. </i>

10:10.044 --> 10:12.089
<i>He expressed frustration
about what he saw </i>

10:12.220 --> 10:14.918
<i>as Washington's reluctance
to support the war. </i>

10:15.049 --> 10:17.007
<i>"I wish the politicians
would get off their fat, </i>

10:17.138 --> 10:21.055
<i>soft posteriors," he wrote,
"and clear this mess up." </i>

10:21.185 --> 10:24.232
<i>In 1971, when North returned
from Vietnam, </i>

10:24.362 --> 10:26.190
<i>he continued to speak out.</i>

10:26.321 --> 10:28.192
Yes, I have a question
for Captain North.

10:28.323 --> 10:30.064
Did you ever yourself witness

10:30.194 --> 10:32.414
the mistreatment
of Viet Cong prisoners

10:32.544 --> 10:34.198
by either American
or South Vietnamese troops?

10:34.329 --> 10:37.332
I never witnessed
a single ear being cut off,

10:37.462 --> 10:40.161
a single round being fired
at a man without a rifle,

10:40.291 --> 10:42.816
a single piece of ordnance
dropped at, on,

10:42.946 --> 10:44.295
or near a village of any type

10:44.426 --> 10:47.124
or a single civilian
being maltreated

10:47.255 --> 10:50.780
by either South Vietnamese
or American personnel.

10:50.911 --> 10:52.347
Is that specific, sir?

10:52.477 --> 10:54.088
<i>North would later say</i>

10:54.218 --> 10:56.351
<i>that the war was not lost
in Vietnam. </i>

10:56.481 --> 10:59.093
<i>It was lost in Washington.</i>

10:59.223 --> 11:02.009
<i>In 1981,</i>

11:02.139 --> 11:04.968
<i>he moved there himself
and began work at the NSC. </i>

11:05.099 --> 11:09.277
Ollie North came
across reporters' radar early,

11:09.407 --> 11:12.062
but no one quite knew
what he did.

11:12.193 --> 11:13.673
Well, it turned out

11:13.803 --> 11:17.198
that he was a special
operations aficionado,

11:17.328 --> 11:19.417
a counterterrorism aficionado.

11:19.548 --> 11:24.074
And over time,
he made that his specialty

11:24.205 --> 11:27.077
in the
National Security Council.

11:27.208 --> 11:29.253
<i>After years of military duty,</i>

11:29.384 --> 11:31.212
<i>the job was North's
first opportunity </i>

11:31.342 --> 11:33.170
<i>to test
his patriotic principles </i>

11:33.301 --> 11:35.129
<i>off the battlefield,</i>

11:35.259 --> 11:38.480
<i>from inside the halls
of Washington, DC. </i>

11:38.610 --> 11:40.700
<i>And thanks to
a Soviet-sponsored civil war </i>

11:40.830 --> 11:42.919
<i>raging south of
the American border... </i>

11:43.050 --> 11:45.313
Ah!

11:45.443 --> 11:47.271
<i>...North had quite a bit of work
ahead of him. </i>

11:50.361 --> 11:52.320
I started my career
as a foreign correspondent

11:52.450 --> 11:54.496
in the Middle East,

11:54.626 --> 11:57.368
covering the Iranian revolution
and the Iranian hostage crisis.

11:57.499 --> 12:00.720
So I was immersed
in Iranian affairs at the time.

12:00.850 --> 12:03.200
And a few years later,
when I got to Washington,

12:03.331 --> 12:06.943
my editors asked what subjects
I wanted to focus on.

12:07.074 --> 12:08.510
And I said,
"I don't care what it is

12:08.640 --> 12:10.381
"as long as it has
nothing to do with Iran.

12:10.512 --> 12:12.035
I'm sick and tired
of that country."

12:12.166 --> 12:13.384
They said, "Fine.

12:13.515 --> 12:15.517
"We want you
to cover Central America.

12:15.647 --> 12:18.172
That will have nothing to do
with Iran at all."

12:18.302 --> 12:20.348
And so I began to learn
about Nicaragua.

12:22.524 --> 12:25.309
<i>And here is where
we get to the Contra part </i>

12:25.440 --> 12:28.051
<i>of the Iran-Contra scandal.</i>

12:28.182 --> 12:31.141
<i>-Solo el pueblo!
- both] Solo el pueblo! </i>

12:31.272 --> 12:33.056
<i>You see, Ronald Reagan</i>

12:33.187 --> 12:35.624
<i>held a pretty simple view
of the world. </i>

12:35.755 --> 12:39.062
<i>There were the good guys,
and there were the bad guys. </i>

12:39.193 --> 12:42.109
<i>And the president of Nicaragua,
Anastasio Somoza, </i>

12:42.239 --> 12:44.372
<i>was one of the good guys.</i>

12:44.502 --> 12:46.330
<i>But around the time
Reagan began his march </i>

12:46.461 --> 12:48.506
<i>to the White House in the 1970s,</i>

12:48.637 --> 12:51.988
<i>the Central American country
was rocked by revolution. </i>

12:56.514 --> 12:59.213
My fellow Americans,
I must speak to you tonight

12:59.343 --> 13:01.476
about a mounting danger
in Central America

13:01.606 --> 13:05.306
that threatens the security
of the United States.

13:05.436 --> 13:08.309
<i>As Reagan described it
to the American people, </i>

13:08.439 --> 13:11.529
<i>this was a clash between
the Soviet-backed Sandinistas </i>

13:11.660 --> 13:15.403
<i>and a counterrevolutionary
force called the Contras. </i>

13:15.533 --> 13:18.319
Using Nicaragua as a base,
the Soviets and Cubans

13:18.449 --> 13:21.235
can become the dominant power
in the crucial corridor

13:21.365 --> 13:23.280
between North
and South America.

13:23.411 --> 13:25.152
<i>It was framed
as a classic battle </i>

13:25.282 --> 13:28.285
<i>between communism and democracy.</i>

13:28.416 --> 13:30.461
<i>But it was never
really that simple. </i>

13:33.551 --> 13:39.122
Nicaragua was the classic
Central American dictatorship.

13:39.253 --> 13:41.472
It had been ruled
for several generations

13:41.603 --> 13:44.519
by the Somoza family.

13:44.649 --> 13:49.219
It was a thoroughly repressive
and corrupt and nasty regime.

13:49.350 --> 13:51.265
To maintain the peace
of a country

13:51.395 --> 13:54.268
is a way
of protecting the people.

13:54.398 --> 13:56.792
Neutralizing those
who break the peace

13:56.923 --> 14:00.230
is also a form
of protecting the people.

14:00.361 --> 14:04.844
I grew up in a household
that was firmly <i>antisomocista.</i>

14:06.454 --> 14:08.282
However, right,

14:08.412 --> 14:11.024
I had relatives all over
the political spectrum.

14:12.721 --> 14:14.592
My name
is Victoria González-Rivera.

14:14.723 --> 14:17.987
I grew up in Nicaragua during
the Sandinista Revolution

14:18.118 --> 14:20.120
and the Contra War.

14:20.250 --> 14:23.166
Many Nicaraguans
supported the Somozas.

14:23.297 --> 14:26.126
And they did horrific things--
human rights abuses

14:26.256 --> 14:27.736
and massacres.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.739
But many people were willing
to look the other way

14:30.870 --> 14:34.874
if they thought that
it benefited them economically.

14:35.004 --> 14:39.226
The Somoza regime was,
of course, for many years,

14:39.356 --> 14:41.271
a close ally
of the United States.

14:41.402 --> 14:44.231
And in the 1950s
and the 1960s,

14:44.361 --> 14:46.668
if a regime
was anti-communist,

14:46.798 --> 14:50.411
that was essentially all anyone
in Washington needed to know.

14:51.499 --> 14:53.022
<i>Good afternoon.
From the steps </i>

14:53.153 --> 14:54.632
<i>of New York City Hall,</i>

14:54.763 --> 14:56.286
<i>your city station brings you
the official reception </i>

14:56.417 --> 14:58.375
<i>to the president of Nicaragua,</i>

14:58.506 --> 15:00.377
<i>the honorable
Anastasio Somoza. </i>

15:03.424 --> 15:07.602
<i>
I feel very proud to say </i>

15:07.732 --> 15:12.389
<i>that the Nicaraguan people
and President Somoza </i>

15:12.520 --> 15:15.218
<i>are the best friend
the United States have </i>

15:15.349 --> 15:17.177
<i>and will ever have
in Latin America. </i>

15:20.441 --> 15:22.443
<i>America's friendship
with the Somoza regime </i>

15:22.573 --> 15:28.405
<i>was put to the test
just before Christmas of 1972 </i>

15:28.536 --> 15:31.234
<i>when Nicaragua's capital city,
Managua, </i>

15:31.365 --> 15:33.410
<i>was all but destroyed
by an earthquake. </i>

15:33.541 --> 15:35.891
This, now,
is the tragedy of Managua.

15:36.022 --> 15:37.458
The thousands and thousands
of men,

15:37.588 --> 15:39.416
women, and children,

15:39.547 --> 15:41.331
who have been told that
they have to leave their city,

15:41.462 --> 15:42.942
because it's no longer safe.

16:21.545 --> 16:23.373
The whole
of the center of the city

16:23.504 --> 16:27.464
is gradually being
eaten up my flames.

16:27.595 --> 16:29.858
It's the faces of
the children involved

16:29.989 --> 16:32.817
that reflect the tragedy of
a great disaster like Managua

16:32.948 --> 16:35.298
more than all the pictures
of shattered buildings

16:35.429 --> 16:37.605
and blazing fires.

16:37.735 --> 16:40.738
I was just three,
almost four years old.

16:40.869 --> 16:44.133
You know, it changed a lot.
It changed Nicaragua forever.

16:46.788 --> 16:48.311
There was great concern
because, of course,

16:48.442 --> 16:49.834
so many people died.

16:49.965 --> 16:51.575
Under the rubble
of these buildings,

16:51.706 --> 16:54.622
there still lie countless
thousands of bodies

16:54.752 --> 16:56.319
which are decaying
and presenting

16:56.450 --> 16:58.365
a major health risk.

17:11.552 --> 17:14.337
<i>Bulldozers combed the streets</i>

17:14.468 --> 17:16.426
<i>in search of bodies
buried beneath the rubble. </i>

17:16.557 --> 17:18.646
<i>And as the city burned,</i>

17:18.776 --> 17:21.344
<i>Somoza declared martial law.</i>

17:21.475 --> 17:22.737
Approximately 80%

17:22.867 --> 17:25.435
of all the buildings
have been badly damaged,

17:25.566 --> 17:27.481
and they have
to be surveyed to see

17:27.611 --> 17:31.659
if they are safe to inhabit.
We are going to live in tents

17:31.789 --> 17:35.228
until we make an appreciation
of the situation,

17:35.358 --> 17:36.707
and the government will have

17:36.838 --> 17:38.492
to decide
what they're going to do.

17:41.669 --> 17:43.497
Throughout the week,
there's been a nonstop stream

17:43.627 --> 17:45.368
of relief aircraft

17:45.499 --> 17:47.588
coming here with food
and medical supplies.

17:50.504 --> 17:52.810
Food and water
are still desperately needed.

17:52.941 --> 17:53.768
And there's criticism
that the supplies,

17:53.898 --> 17:55.813
which have been coming in,

17:55.944 --> 17:57.815
are not going to the people
for whom they were intended.

17:57.946 --> 17:59.643
<i>In the aftermath
of the earthquake, </i>

17:59.774 --> 18:01.297
<i>the Somoza government
was accused </i>

18:01.428 --> 18:02.907
<i>of stockpiling foreign aid</i>

18:03.038 --> 18:05.649
<i>and engaging in various
other forms of fraud. </i>

18:05.780 --> 18:07.390
What do you need
at the moment?

18:07.521 --> 18:09.175
Right now,
what is your most urgent need?

18:09.305 --> 18:11.655
Hospital beds.

18:11.786 --> 18:14.397
We have people here
with fractures untreated.

18:14.528 --> 18:16.747
No treatment for four days.
No food for four days.

18:16.878 --> 18:18.575
I saw people
drinking sewage water.

19:08.886 --> 19:10.758
It felt very heavy.

19:10.888 --> 19:12.760
You know, like,
the air felt heavy,

19:12.890 --> 19:13.717
like something
was going to happen.

19:13.848 --> 19:14.979
There was always
this sense of...

19:17.068 --> 19:18.635
The war is coming.
The war is coming.

19:24.554 --> 19:27.688
<i>In response,
a revolutionary group </i>

19:27.818 --> 19:30.517
<i>called the Sandinistas
started to gain momentum. </i>

19:33.041 --> 19:34.825
The Sandinistas take
their name from national hero

19:34.956 --> 19:36.784
Augusto Sandino,

19:36.914 --> 19:38.786
who fought against
a United States intervention

19:38.916 --> 19:41.397
in Nicaragua in the 1920s.

19:41.528 --> 19:43.486
The idea was obviously

19:43.617 --> 19:46.968
that Nicaragua needs
to be ruled by Nicaraguans,

19:47.098 --> 19:50.667
and it was very much
an anti-imperialist position.

19:50.798 --> 19:54.584
<i>-Solo el pueblo!
- Solo el pueblo! </i>

19:54.715 --> 19:56.934
You know, they were
influenced by socialists,

19:57.065 --> 19:58.371
socialist thought,
by the Cuban Revolution

19:58.501 --> 19:59.589
in particular.

20:02.766 --> 20:04.899
<i>They trained
in the mountains of Nicaragua </i>

20:05.029 --> 20:07.467
<i>and, over time, built up
their military strength. </i>

20:11.079 --> 20:13.473
This is a war against Somoza.

20:13.603 --> 20:16.215
You know,
these are young men, groups,

20:16.345 --> 20:18.695
who want to do something
and change this country.

20:58.692 --> 21:01.564
How long do you think
this war will now last?

21:01.695 --> 21:03.523
I give it a week.

21:03.653 --> 21:05.655
In Nicaragua,
the rebellion continues.

21:11.008 --> 21:13.010
These men,
apparently rebel fighters,

21:13.141 --> 21:14.882
were not known
in this neighborhood,

21:15.012 --> 21:17.276
and no one claimed them
for burial.

21:17.406 --> 21:20.061
The Red Cross burned
the bodies in the streets.

21:20.191 --> 21:22.933
They were concerned about
the spread of disease.

21:23.064 --> 21:25.371
<i>The brutality
of Somoza's regime pushed </i>

21:25.501 --> 21:28.678
<i>even moderates in Nicaragua to
support the Sandinista cause. </i>

21:28.809 --> 21:31.725
He's killing innocent people.

21:31.855 --> 21:33.683
Witnesses have seen
with their own eyes

21:33.814 --> 21:36.947
how they have killed men,
women and children.

21:37.078 --> 21:39.646
He's a monster.
He's an assassin.

22:01.058 --> 22:02.799
Somoza is defiant.

22:02.930 --> 22:05.498
This week he told reporters,
"I will not resign."

22:05.628 --> 22:06.760
If they had the support

22:06.890 --> 22:10.503
of the people,
I wouldn't be here.

22:10.633 --> 22:12.505
And if Somoza doesn't go?

22:12.635 --> 22:14.115
We'll keep on fighting.

22:14.245 --> 22:17.901
<i>In 1978,
President Carter stopped aid </i>

22:18.032 --> 22:19.729
<i>to Somoza's government,</i>

22:19.860 --> 22:21.731
<i>citing human
rights violations. </i>

22:21.862 --> 22:23.559
The Americans
now believe, in effect,

22:23.690 --> 22:24.952
that you've got to go,
that they will no longer

22:25.082 --> 22:26.910
continue
to support you in power.

22:27.041 --> 22:30.653
As far as I've heard
officially,

22:30.784 --> 22:34.091
the United States is not
in favor of my overthrow.

22:34.222 --> 22:36.790
<i>The Sandinistas
saw this as an opportunity </i>

22:36.920 --> 22:38.661
<i>and launched
an emboldened campaign </i>

22:38.792 --> 22:39.923
<i>to overthrow the dictator.</i>

22:43.013 --> 22:44.624
The Sandinista
guerrillas have launched

22:44.754 --> 22:47.975
what they call
their Final Offensive.

22:48.105 --> 22:50.673
<i>Led by Commander Eden Pastora,</i>

22:50.804 --> 22:52.849
<i>the Sandinistas seized
the national palace </i>

22:52.980 --> 22:55.765
<i>while the legislature
was in session. </i>

23:00.117 --> 23:01.815
<i>They overpowered the building</i>

23:01.945 --> 23:03.686
<i>and took 2,000
government officials </i>

23:03.817 --> 23:05.601
<i>and employees as hostages.</i>

23:07.516 --> 23:09.866
After the storming
of the palace, it was clear

23:09.997 --> 23:12.391
that Somoza
had lost his grip on power.

23:40.244 --> 23:42.116
So our parents send us off

23:42.246 --> 23:43.944
to live
with my grandparents.

23:44.074 --> 23:45.902
We end up in Seattle,

23:46.033 --> 23:49.253
and we don't know what is
happening to our parents.

23:49.384 --> 23:51.647
Sandinista rebels
are fighting Nicaraguan troops

23:51.778 --> 23:53.257
again in Managua today.

23:53.388 --> 23:55.085
Nicaragua was on
the news every single night,

23:55.216 --> 23:57.871
so we're watching it on TV.

23:58.001 --> 24:00.874
We even witnessed my street
on television,

24:01.004 --> 24:03.920
because that's where a lot of
the fighting was taking place.

24:04.051 --> 24:05.879
My grandma is a wreck,

24:06.009 --> 24:08.098
and she's trying to get
the U.S. Embassy

24:08.229 --> 24:11.188
to tell her
where her daughter is.

24:11.319 --> 24:13.887
Finally,
after a year of war,

24:14.017 --> 24:17.891
Somoza fled Nicaragua, and the
Sandinistas declared victory.

24:18.021 --> 24:20.241
The weeks of rumors
became fact today

24:20.371 --> 24:24.027
as President Anastasio Somoza
of Nicaragua resigned.

24:24.158 --> 24:25.028
<i>The president
turned in his resignation </i>

24:25.159 --> 24:26.987
<i>early this morning.</i>

24:27.117 --> 24:27.944
<i>And an aide who was present
at the bunker </i>

24:28.075 --> 24:29.816
<i>said the President</i>

24:29.946 --> 24:31.992
<i>tearfully hugged staff
members one last time. </i>

24:36.126 --> 24:41.044
<i>The Sandinistas took
control of Nicaragua in 1979, </i>

24:41.175 --> 24:44.047
<i>the same year that a parallel
revolution took hold in Iran. </i>

24:46.397 --> 24:49.966
<i>Both countries were one-time
U.S. allies turned enemies... </i>

24:55.929 --> 24:59.280
<i>...which made 1979
a distinctly destabilizing year </i>

24:59.410 --> 25:01.108
<i>for American dominance
across the world. </i>

25:03.937 --> 25:06.156
<i>But even as global tensions
simmered, </i>

25:06.287 --> 25:09.943
<i>it felt like peace
had come to Nicaragua. </i>

25:49.330 --> 25:52.202
<i>The euphoria
wouldn't last long. </i>

25:52.333 --> 25:56.946
<i>Soon, a new armed conflict
was brewing in Nicaragua, </i>

25:57.077 --> 25:58.948
<i>one that the new
American president </i>

25:59.079 --> 26:01.037
<i>would be watching
very closely. </i>

26:16.444 --> 26:18.489
<i>As the Sandinistas took power,</i>

26:18.620 --> 26:20.056
<i>they confronted
the instability </i>

26:20.187 --> 26:21.971
<i>left by the Somoza regime.</i>

26:24.365 --> 26:26.019
Because
the departing Somocistas

26:26.149 --> 26:28.064
took with them all the cash
and gold reserves

26:28.195 --> 26:29.544
they could carry,

26:29.675 --> 26:31.067
Nicaragua's agriculture
and industry

26:31.198 --> 26:33.853
have been in a bad way.

26:33.983 --> 26:37.160
Many people tend to
romanticize revolutions.

26:37.291 --> 26:40.294
They forget about
the unintended consequences.

26:41.077 --> 26:43.210
Queues for food
have become a common sight,

26:43.340 --> 26:45.125
because the government
has been unable

26:45.255 --> 26:47.997
<i>to eliminate shortages
in certain basic commodities. </i>

26:48.128 --> 26:51.914
We are trying to fight
for the creation

26:52.045 --> 26:55.439
of a social democratic system
in this country.

26:55.570 --> 26:58.921
The revolution was
a revolution of young people,

26:59.052 --> 27:00.923
and so inevitably,

27:01.054 --> 27:03.143
all these young people
went on to make mistakes,

27:03.273 --> 27:07.408
in part because they--
they didn't know any better.

27:07.538 --> 27:10.933
<i>As the Sandinistas struggled
to create a government, </i>

27:11.064 --> 27:13.632
<i>those who opposed them
began to organize. </i>

27:13.762 --> 27:19.986
Over time those ragged
remnants of Somoza's army

27:20.116 --> 27:21.988
coalesced

27:22.118 --> 27:25.078
in a not very well organized,
not very well funded,

27:25.208 --> 27:28.124
not very coherent
set of forces.

27:30.605 --> 27:33.129
They called themselves
the counterrevolutionaries.

27:33.260 --> 27:35.479
They were trying
to overthrow the revolution.

27:35.610 --> 27:38.134
And their shorthand name
became "the Contras."

27:41.572 --> 27:43.052
The Nicaraguan
Democratic Force

27:43.183 --> 27:44.619
is the largest Contra group

27:44.750 --> 27:47.230
opposing the Sandinista
government.

27:47.361 --> 27:50.190
We're fighting
for the democratic rescue

27:50.320 --> 27:52.018
of the Nicaraguan Revolution.

27:54.020 --> 27:55.021
Some of these people

27:55.151 --> 27:56.283
may be former
national guardsmen.

27:56.413 --> 27:58.154
some are simple peasants

27:58.285 --> 28:00.287
trying hard to become
professional soldiers.

28:00.417 --> 28:05.161
We need food, boots,
arms, everything.

28:05.292 --> 28:08.904
But the main thing we need
here is the real support

28:09.035 --> 28:12.995
of the democratic governments.
We need help.

28:13.126 --> 28:16.172
The Sandinistas officially
took control of Nicaragua

28:16.303 --> 28:19.001
around the same time
Ronald Reagan took office,

28:19.132 --> 28:21.482
and he did not conceal
his contempt for them.

28:21.612 --> 28:24.485
There are atrocities
going on in Nicaragua,

28:24.615 --> 28:28.097
but they're largely the work of
the institutionalized cruelty

28:28.228 --> 28:30.012
of the Sandinista government.

28:30.143 --> 28:32.841
America has to see
the true face of Nicaragua.

28:34.538 --> 28:37.150
<i>For Reagan,
the newly leftist Nicaragua </i>

28:37.280 --> 28:38.934
<i>represented the presence
of an enemy </i>

28:39.065 --> 28:41.154
<i>in America's backyard.</i>

28:41.284 --> 28:44.026
<i>And it reflected an escalation
of the decades-long </i>

28:44.157 --> 28:46.376
<i>Cold War conflict
that Reagan ad inherited. </i>

28:46.507 --> 28:50.163
We anticipated a world
of peace and cooperation.

28:50.293 --> 28:53.340
The calculated pressures
of aggressive communism

28:53.470 --> 28:56.343
have forced us, instead,
to live in a world of turmoil.

28:58.693 --> 29:02.044
<i>After World War II,
to be an American president </i>

29:02.175 --> 29:04.133
<i>meant playing a lead role
in the clash </i>

29:04.264 --> 29:06.309
<i>between the East and the West,</i>

29:06.440 --> 29:08.181
<i>between capitalism
and communism. </i>

29:10.487 --> 29:13.012
The Communists' drive
to impose

29:13.142 --> 29:15.405
their political
and economic system on others

29:15.536 --> 29:19.235
is the primary cause
of world tension today.

29:19.366 --> 29:20.759
<i>The conflict played out</i>

29:20.889 --> 29:24.763
<i>in nearly every corner
of the globe. </i>

29:24.893 --> 29:29.332
The contest in Vietnam
is part of a wider pattern

29:29.463 --> 29:31.204
of aggressive purposes.

29:33.467 --> 29:37.253
We can have differences
without being enemies in war.

29:37.384 --> 29:39.995
<i>And in the 1970s,</i>

29:40.126 --> 29:43.085
<i>what had been a Cold War
began to heat up. </i>

29:43.216 --> 29:45.566
The Soviet Union,
in the aftermath of Vietnam,

29:45.696 --> 29:48.134
had begun extending
its influence

29:48.264 --> 29:51.093
all over the Third World.

29:51.224 --> 29:55.576
There is no Soviet domination
of Eastern Europe,

29:55.706 --> 29:58.579
and there never will be
under a Ford administration.

30:01.147 --> 30:03.236
We demand
that the Soviets withdraw

30:03.366 --> 30:04.977
from Afghanistan.

30:06.587 --> 30:08.371
I pledge to you
that we will do

30:08.502 --> 30:11.461
everything we can to win
this great struggle.

30:11.592 --> 30:15.117
The Reagan administration
saw a Cold War

30:15.248 --> 30:17.424
domino theory kind of world,

30:17.554 --> 30:20.340
one in which it was
a zero-sum game

30:20.470 --> 30:24.344
between the American side
and the Soviet side.

30:24.474 --> 30:28.043
Will we support freedom
in this hemisphere or not?

30:28.174 --> 30:29.436
Will we defend
our vital interests

30:29.566 --> 30:32.265
in this hemisphere or not?

30:32.395 --> 30:36.486
Will we act
while there is still time?

30:36.617 --> 30:40.360
To have the Sandinistas
in Nicaragua,

30:40.490 --> 30:44.712
I think Reagan felt
that they could very well

30:44.843 --> 30:51.240
provide a foothold for communism
in this hemisphere.

30:51.371 --> 30:54.678
As Ronald Reagan was fond of
telling the American public,

30:54.809 --> 30:56.855
"You'd have a wave of refugees
fleeing the communists..."

30:56.985 --> 30:58.552
More than a quarter
of a million refugees

30:58.682 --> 31:01.294
have fled Nicaragua since
the Sandinistas took control.

31:01.424 --> 31:03.296
Hundreds of thousands
of refugees

31:03.426 --> 31:06.168
fleeing communist oppression
to seek entry into our country.

31:06.299 --> 31:08.257
We don't want to see the map
of Central America

31:08.388 --> 31:11.086
covered in a sea of red,

31:11.217 --> 31:13.219
eventually lapping
at our own borders.

31:13.349 --> 31:15.482
We must act now.

31:18.615 --> 31:20.356
One of
the perennial challenges

31:20.487 --> 31:22.489
for American diplomacy

31:22.619 --> 31:28.103
and American intelligence
during the Cold War was:

31:28.234 --> 31:31.280
What do you do
when there is a hostile force

31:31.411 --> 31:35.328
or an unfriendly government
somewhere in the Third World?

31:35.458 --> 31:38.026
Ronald Reagan's solution
was to overthrow

31:38.157 --> 31:39.723
the Sandinista government

31:39.854 --> 31:42.552
and make it clear
to all the other insurgents

31:42.683 --> 31:44.554
that the United States

31:44.685 --> 31:46.861
was going to draw the line
against revolution

31:46.992 --> 31:49.342
and that everybody
was gonna suffer,

31:49.472 --> 31:50.256
and they should
just give it up.

31:52.214 --> 31:54.608
<i>And so, in December of 1981,</i>

31:54.738 --> 31:58.220
<i>Reagan secretly authorized
the CIA to help the Contras </i>

31:58.351 --> 32:00.570
<i>in their fight
against the Sandinistas. </i>

32:00.701 --> 32:03.530
They are the moral equal
of our Founding Fathers

32:03.660 --> 32:06.315
and the brave men and women
of the French Resistance.

32:06.446 --> 32:08.578
We cannot turn away from them,

32:08.709 --> 32:12.582
for the struggle here
is not right versus left.

32:12.713 --> 32:16.412
- It is right versus wrong.

32:16.543 --> 32:19.415
<i>The CIA began supplying
the Contras with weapons </i>

32:19.546 --> 32:21.548
<i>as well as money
and strategic advice. </i>

32:23.463 --> 32:24.725
<i>For months,
the Reagan administration </i>

32:24.855 --> 32:27.293
<i>had a guiding hand
in Nicaragua's civil war. </i>

32:29.817 --> 32:32.951
<i>And, for a while, the CIA's
activities went undetected. </i>

32:34.430 --> 32:35.431
<i>But then...</i>

32:37.564 --> 32:39.609
<i>the extent of the CIA's
involvement in Nicaragua </i>

32:39.740 --> 32:41.785
<i>came under scrutiny</i>

32:41.916 --> 32:44.179
<i>when Newsweek published
an explosive cover story </i>

32:44.310 --> 32:46.747
<i>on the operation in 1982.</i>

32:46.877 --> 32:48.488
Sources in Washington reveal

32:48.618 --> 32:50.751
CIA officers have directed

32:50.881 --> 32:53.406
and funded the war
against Nicaragua,

32:53.536 --> 32:57.018
CIA employees executing
the more damaging attacks.

32:57.149 --> 32:59.455
More and more members of
Congress are asking questions

32:59.586 --> 33:00.979
and demanding answers

33:01.109 --> 33:03.459
about the United States' role
in Nicaragua.

33:03.590 --> 33:05.592
I would hope and pray

33:05.722 --> 33:07.333
that the policy
of this government

33:07.463 --> 33:09.509
would be
the policy of diplomacy

33:09.639 --> 33:11.554
and not gunboat diplomacy.

33:14.949 --> 33:18.561
It's important for
a director of the CIA or,

33:18.692 --> 33:20.172
for that matter,
anyone who's head

33:20.302 --> 33:21.738
of an intelligence agency,

33:21.869 --> 33:24.393
to make certain
that members of Congress

33:24.524 --> 33:27.353
are fully informed
of covert operations.

33:28.615 --> 33:30.312
We are not doing anything

33:30.443 --> 33:31.748
to try and overthrow
the Nicaraguan government,

33:31.879 --> 33:34.490
and anything that
we're doing in that area

33:34.621 --> 33:38.364
is simply trying to
interdict the supply lines,

33:38.494 --> 33:41.323
which are supplying
the guerillas in El Salvador.

33:41.454 --> 33:44.500
What can happen is
you can get individuals

33:44.631 --> 33:47.764
that will abuse the power
of this country

33:47.895 --> 33:52.247
and will do things that
ultimately could be damaging

33:52.378 --> 33:54.641
to our national security.

33:54.771 --> 33:57.557
That was the whole purpose
of the Boland Amendment.

33:57.687 --> 33:59.559
The secret war hasn't
brought Central America

33:59.689 --> 34:01.474
closer to peace

34:01.604 --> 34:04.520
or Nicaragua closer
to democracy.

34:04.651 --> 34:08.089
What it does do is provide
the Sandinistas

34:08.220 --> 34:12.267
with the perfect excuse
to foist unfair elections,

34:12.398 --> 34:14.704
a huge Army, censorship,

34:14.835 --> 34:18.447
and the draft upon
the Nicaraguan people.

34:18.578 --> 34:21.450
<i>The Boland amendment
specifically banned the CIA </i>

34:21.581 --> 34:23.757
<i>and other U.S. intelligence
agencies from supporting </i>

34:23.887 --> 34:27.500
<i>anyone trying to overthrow
the Sandinista government. </i>

34:27.630 --> 34:29.371
<i>Its purpose was to keep
the United States </i>

34:29.502 --> 34:30.851
<i>out of Nicaragua,</i>

34:30.981 --> 34:33.593
<i>lest it became
another Vietnam. </i>

34:33.723 --> 34:35.638
By and large,
I think that what

34:35.769 --> 34:37.553
this committee has done

34:37.684 --> 34:40.513
is in the interests
of our government.

34:40.643 --> 34:41.905
Once again,
when the going gets tough,

34:42.036 --> 34:43.733
the United States quits.

34:43.864 --> 34:45.431
That's the message
we're going to broadcast

34:45.561 --> 34:46.823
to the rest of the world

34:46.954 --> 34:49.261
if we in fact
cut off our assistance

34:49.391 --> 34:50.827
to the Nicaraguan resistance.

34:50.958 --> 34:54.527
Silly, foolish, dangerous,
tragic, naive,

34:54.657 --> 34:57.225
sad--it's all of those things,
and even more.

34:59.053 --> 35:00.446
It is, by now,

35:00.576 --> 35:01.664
a familiar
American predicament:

35:01.795 --> 35:03.623
If we abandon the rebels

35:03.753 --> 35:05.886
to whom we've given
encouragement, arms and money,

35:06.016 --> 35:07.888
they will be left
high and dry.

35:08.018 --> 35:11.413
It happened in Vietnam,
Cambodia, Iran, and Lebanon.

35:11.544 --> 35:13.546
But if we continue
to support the Contras,

35:13.676 --> 35:15.548
and they continue to war
on the economy

35:15.678 --> 35:17.637
and civilians
of Nicaragua,

35:17.767 --> 35:20.030
then we will be subsidizing
violence against people

35:20.161 --> 35:23.686
who happen to be living in the
wrong place at the wrong time

35:23.817 --> 35:25.645
who have done us no harm.

35:27.516 --> 35:29.344
<i>The debate over
the Boland Amendment </i>

35:29.475 --> 35:31.651
<i>coincided with a major
PR campaign </i>

35:31.781 --> 35:34.915
<i>by the Reagan administration
to rally public support </i>

35:35.045 --> 35:37.787
<i>around the anti-communist
Contra cause. </i>

35:37.918 --> 35:40.399
These men are not putting
their lives on the line

35:40.529 --> 35:42.792
to restore a dictatorship
of the past.

35:42.923 --> 35:44.794
These men are fighting
for freedom.

35:44.925 --> 35:46.579
If we give them
the aid they need,

35:46.709 --> 35:48.537
the Nicaraguan people
can win this battle

35:48.668 --> 35:50.452
for freedom on their own.

35:53.716 --> 35:55.762
<i>To do so, the CIA
started to assemble </i>

35:55.892 --> 35:58.417
<i>a group of Nicaraguan
counterrevolutionaries </i>

35:58.547 --> 36:00.549
<i>who could lend a public face
to the struggle. </i>

36:07.600 --> 36:10.472
<i>Edgar Chamorro had moved
to Miami from Managua, </i>

36:10.603 --> 36:12.605
<i>and in his free time,</i>

36:12.735 --> 36:14.563
<i>he was meeting with a group
of fellow Nicaraguan expats </i>

36:14.694 --> 36:15.999
<i>to discuss their country</i>

36:16.130 --> 36:17.653
<i>and strategize about
their possible return. </i>

36:44.071 --> 36:48.902
<i>The man told Chamorro
his name was Tony Feldman </i>

36:49.032 --> 36:50.817
<i>and that he was calling from
the National Security Agency. </i>

36:53.733 --> 36:56.866
<i>Mr. Feldman didn't mention
a connection to the CIA, </i>

36:56.997 --> 36:59.478
<i>but it's safe to assume
that he had one. </i>

37:17.713 --> 37:18.975
<i>The man told Chamorro</i>

37:19.106 --> 37:21.064
<i>that the Nicaraguan
Democratic Force, </i>

37:21.195 --> 37:22.849
<i>known as the FDN,</i>

37:22.979 --> 37:25.765
<i>was recruiting
a panel of new leaders. </i>

37:25.895 --> 37:28.463
<i>The panel would be a military
and political hybrid </i>

37:28.594 --> 37:30.117
<i>made up of Nicaraguan expats</i>

37:30.248 --> 37:32.511
<i>who were dedicated to rolling
back the Sandinistas. </i>

37:46.960 --> 37:49.702
<i>With that,
Chamorro became a Contra. </i>

37:49.832 --> 37:51.704
<i>He returned
to Central America, </i>

37:51.834 --> 37:54.141
<i>where his task was to sell
the Contra cause </i>

37:54.272 --> 37:57.536
<i>both to the American public
and to his countrymen. </i>

37:57.666 --> 37:59.712
<i>He gave interviews,
distributed fliers, </i>

37:59.842 --> 38:01.888
<i>and established
a pro-Contra radio station, </i>

38:02.018 --> 38:04.412
<i>broadcasting out of Honduras.</i>

38:31.787 --> 38:33.789
In Nicaragua,
the war between the Contras

38:33.920 --> 38:37.053
and the ruling Sandinistas
continues.

38:37.184 --> 38:38.794
<i>The Reagan Administration</i>

38:38.925 --> 38:41.841
<i>continued to find ways
to support the Contras. </i>

38:41.971 --> 38:43.582
<i>At least for now,
it seemed the White House </i>

38:43.712 --> 38:45.018
<i>was taking a quiet approach</i>

38:45.148 --> 38:48.978
<i>to Reagan's fervent
anti-communism crusade. </i>

38:49.109 --> 38:53.505
<i>Then, in 1983, the CIA did
something quite a bit noisier. </i>

38:55.681 --> 38:56.986
<i>In a pre-dawn strike,</i>

38:57.117 --> 38:59.075
<i>the Contras blew up
fuel storage tanks, </i>

38:59.206 --> 39:01.991
<i>turning most of the country's
oil reserves into flames. </i>

39:02.122 --> 39:03.863
<i>By helping
the Contras attack </i>

39:03.993 --> 39:08.607
<i>a major port about
100 miles north of Managua. </i>

39:08.737 --> 39:09.999
It was the Contras
who took the credit,

39:10.130 --> 39:11.914
but CBS news has learned

39:12.045 --> 39:14.917
it was Americans
who led the raid.

39:15.048 --> 39:17.877
Publicly, the Pentagon won't
talk about those actions,

39:18.007 --> 39:20.488
and privately the American
military just keeps doing them.

39:22.664 --> 39:23.796
The law of the land,

39:23.926 --> 39:25.711
as embodied
in the Boland Amendment,

39:25.841 --> 39:29.758
is not being fully adhered to.

39:29.889 --> 39:31.934
If the law is being violated
in the Congress,

39:32.065 --> 39:34.850
then we do have
a clear responsibility

39:34.981 --> 39:36.678
to bring our government
into compliance.

39:38.767 --> 39:40.029
<i>The bombing of the port
in Nicaragua </i>

39:40.160 --> 39:41.770
<i>was a turning point</i>

39:41.901 --> 39:42.989
<i>for the Reagan
administration's ability </i>

39:43.119 --> 39:45.818
<i>to operate effectively
and covertly </i>

39:45.948 --> 39:47.733
<i>in the war
against the Sandinistas. </i>

39:47.863 --> 39:49.735
Nicaraguans are still
attempting to repair

39:49.865 --> 39:51.737
the oil storage tanks

39:51.867 --> 39:55.958
damaged in the biggest attack
yet from the outside.

39:56.089 --> 39:58.396
<i>The bombing provoked
congress to further tighten </i>

39:58.526 --> 39:59.875
<i>the restrictions
on the White House's ability </i>

40:00.006 --> 40:02.661
<i>to help the Contras.</i>

40:02.791 --> 40:03.923
<i>But instead of shifting
their focus away </i>

40:04.053 --> 40:05.968
<i>from Nicaragua completely,</i>

40:06.099 --> 40:09.058
<i>the Reagan White House
found a loophole, </i>

40:09.189 --> 40:12.148
<i>one that led them straight to
the National Security Council. </i>

40:12.279 --> 40:16.849
It turned out that the law
said no intelligence agency

40:16.979 --> 40:19.373
may give this kind of support
to the Contras.

40:19.504 --> 40:21.201
But it didn't say
anything about someone

40:21.331 --> 40:23.595
who wasn't
an intelligence agency.

40:26.336 --> 40:28.121
Somebody had
the quite brilliant idea:

40:28.251 --> 40:30.166
"Well, you know,
the National Security Council

40:30.297 --> 40:32.604
<i>isn't an intelligence agency."</i>

40:37.652 --> 40:39.698
<i>And so in 1984,</i>

40:39.828 --> 40:41.743
<i>Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North</i>

40:41.874 --> 40:45.051
<i>was assigned a new brief:
Nicaragua. </i>

40:45.181 --> 40:47.967
Ollie North had already been
tangentially involved.

40:48.097 --> 40:52.101
Now he became the point man,
formally put in charge of,

40:52.232 --> 40:54.103
as I think he later said,

40:54.234 --> 40:56.976
"Keeping the Contras together,
body and soul."

40:57.106 --> 40:58.760
It was a covert
paramilitary war,

40:58.891 --> 41:01.284
but it was the most
overt covert war

41:01.415 --> 41:05.288
in the history of the CIA.
Everybody knew about it.

41:05.419 --> 41:07.639
It was being conducted
essentially out in the open.

41:09.292 --> 41:12.339
Once the funding was cut off,

41:12.470 --> 41:17.213
then you had the real
covert operations that began.

41:17.344 --> 41:18.867
<i>As part of an early
training mission, </i>

41:18.998 --> 41:21.130
<i>in the spring of 1984,</i>

41:21.261 --> 41:22.915
<i>North traveled
to Central America </i>

41:23.045 --> 41:26.005
<i>to meet the Contras'
military leaders. </i>

41:26.135 --> 41:28.747
<i>Upon his return, North
earnestly told his colleagues </i>

41:28.877 --> 41:30.400
<i>that he made a commitment
to them. </i>

41:30.531 --> 41:32.098
<i>"I told those guys I'd come
through for them," he said. </i>

41:32.228 --> 41:33.752
The Contras,

41:33.882 --> 41:35.231
the Nicaraguan
Freedom Fighters,

41:35.362 --> 41:39.714
are people--living, breathing,
young men and women--

41:39.845 --> 41:41.324
who have had to suffer
a desperate struggle

41:41.455 --> 41:45.154
for liberty, with sporadic
and confusing support

41:45.285 --> 41:47.896
from the United States
of America.

41:48.027 --> 41:49.550
<i>North's dedication
to the Contras </i>

41:49.681 --> 41:52.248
<i>stemmed in part from
his experience of Vietnam, </i>

41:52.379 --> 41:54.250
<i>a war that had
been over for years, </i>

41:54.381 --> 41:56.862
<i>but retained a grip,
not just on North, </i>

41:56.992 --> 41:58.690
<i>but on the whole country.</i>

42:01.649 --> 42:05.697
There was, at the time,
still a Vietnam syndrome.

42:07.916 --> 42:09.309
<i>Before Vietnam,</i>

42:09.439 --> 42:12.747
<i>the United States
had never lost a war. </i>

42:12.878 --> 42:15.445
<i>When American troops
left Saigon in 1975, </i>

42:15.576 --> 42:19.798
<i>it was the start of a new era
in American foreign policy, </i>

42:19.928 --> 42:22.670
<i>one defined by
a traumatic military defeat. </i>

42:22.801 --> 42:24.237
The concern was

42:24.367 --> 42:28.850
that we were basically risking
the possibility

42:28.981 --> 42:31.592
of a greater war
in Central America,

42:31.723 --> 42:34.769
in our own hemisphere,
and that concerned all of us.

42:34.900 --> 42:37.032
The country was torn asunder

42:37.163 --> 42:39.818
by the devastating effects
on human life,

42:39.948 --> 42:42.168
both in Vietnam
and for U.S. citizens

42:42.298 --> 42:44.170
and on our social
and political system.

42:47.216 --> 42:50.480
And so the mantra of, really,

42:50.611 --> 42:52.221
almost the entire
United States

42:52.352 --> 42:54.876
was no more Vietnams.

43:08.194 --> 43:09.891
<i>But to Oliver North,</i>

43:10.022 --> 43:11.893
<i>the Contras looked
like anti-communists </i>

43:12.024 --> 43:14.026
<i>who needed America's help.</i>

43:14.156 --> 43:16.115
<i>And soon after
taking up their cause, </i>

43:16.245 --> 43:18.073
<i>the young lieutenant colonel
began to form a bond </i>

43:18.204 --> 43:19.814
<i>with someone who felt</i>

43:19.945 --> 43:22.164
<i>just as strongly
about protecting them: </i>

43:22.295 --> 43:24.384
<i>CIA Director William Casey.</i>

43:24.514 --> 43:28.997
If that regime succeeds
in consolidating itself,

43:29.128 --> 43:30.956
we can expect that Managua

43:31.086 --> 43:34.960
will become the terrorist
capitol of this hemisphere.

43:37.049 --> 43:40.269
<i>-Casey would drop by room 392.
</i>

43:40.400 --> 43:43.229
<i>Often, he would call North on
the phone over a secure line. </i>

43:46.232 --> 43:48.451
I readily admit
that I was action-oriented,

43:48.582 --> 43:50.845
that I took pride in the fact
that I was counted upon

43:50.976 --> 43:52.194
as a man who got the job done.

43:58.200 --> 44:00.463
<i>But despite his zeal
for the Contras, </i>

44:00.594 --> 44:05.033
<i>North started to realize
he needed a little help. </i>

44:05.164 --> 44:08.471
<i>It was beginning to be a job
too big for just one man. </i>

44:08.602 --> 44:13.955
So Casey went about
looking for private actors,

44:14.086 --> 44:17.002
most of them veterans
of earlier covert wars,

44:17.132 --> 44:19.265
people who weren't in the CIA
or in the military,

44:19.395 --> 44:22.094
who might volunteer
to come back

44:22.224 --> 44:26.968
and work off the books
on unofficial operations.

44:27.099 --> 44:28.927
<i>Casey and North
considered their options </i>

44:29.057 --> 44:31.973
<i>for filling the job at hand.</i>

44:32.104 --> 44:35.281
<i>The candidate had to be
someone they trusted. </i>

44:35.411 --> 44:38.240
<i>It also had to be someone
committed to the cause. </i>

44:39.328 --> 44:42.070
<i>Most importantly, it had to be
someone well-versed </i>

44:42.201 --> 44:45.073
<i>in covert operations.</i>

44:45.204 --> 44:49.338
<i>It was around the end of 1984.</i>

44:49.469 --> 44:51.689
I got contacted
by the government

44:51.819 --> 44:54.822
to come back and work
on a minor little project.

44:59.218 --> 45:02.351
I guess I must have been
temporarily insane.

45:05.180 --> 45:09.881
I agreed to do what I could,
and the rest is history.

45:11.970 --> 45:13.188
My name is Richard Secord.

45:13.319 --> 45:17.018
I'm a retired
U.S. Air Force general.

45:17.149 --> 45:19.586
<i>In the world
of unconventional warfare, </i>

45:19.717 --> 45:22.371
<i>Richard Secord was almost
universally recognized </i>

45:22.502 --> 45:25.113
<i>as a master
of covert air operations. </i>

45:25.244 --> 45:27.942
<i>Covert operation, by definition,</i>

45:28.073 --> 45:32.077
is an operation
that is absolutely secure

45:32.207 --> 45:35.167
and very tightly controlled
so as to maintain the cover

45:35.297 --> 45:38.170
until it's decided
to uncover it.

45:38.300 --> 45:40.563
It's very simple.

45:40.694 --> 45:44.393
<i>Secord had a reputation
for being effective, intense, </i>

45:44.524 --> 45:47.570
<i>and extremely impatient
with bureaucracy. </i>

45:47.701 --> 45:51.226
<i>By the time CIA Director
Bill Casey called him, </i>

45:51.357 --> 45:54.360
<i>Secord had 28 years
of combat experience, </i>

45:54.490 --> 45:56.449
<i>both in guerilla wars in Asia</i>

45:56.579 --> 45:59.278
<i>and in conventional
air operations in Iran. </i>

45:59.408 --> 46:02.368
I was in charge
of a lot of air operations

46:02.498 --> 46:05.153
and learned the trade
pretty well, I think.

46:05.284 --> 46:07.547
You have to have true teamwork,

46:07.677 --> 46:10.506
and you have to be
quite comfortable

46:10.637 --> 46:13.771
<i>with small unit operations,</i>

46:13.901 --> 46:16.382
because they don't involve
a lot of people.

46:16.512 --> 46:18.514
<i>Secord's career in government
had been cut short </i>

46:18.645 --> 46:20.386
<i>after allegations surfaced</i>

46:20.516 --> 46:23.128
<i>that he was involved
in a secret arms dealing network </i>

46:23.258 --> 46:25.565
<i>that, among other things,
tried to sell explosives </i>

46:25.695 --> 46:27.306
<i>to Libya's dictator
Muamar Gadafi. </i>

46:30.439 --> 46:33.268
<i>But that's a different fiasco.</i>

46:33.399 --> 46:36.358
It was quite a long haul,

46:36.489 --> 46:39.100
and I wouldn't change
much of it.

46:39.231 --> 46:42.277
The secretary of defense
himself, Caspar Weinberger,

46:42.408 --> 46:44.366
officiated
at my retirement ceremony,

46:44.497 --> 46:47.630
so I guess
I didn't retire in disgrace.

46:47.761 --> 46:50.459
<i>Bill Casey was well aware
of Secord's past </i>

46:50.590 --> 46:52.505
<i>and more than willing
to look beyond it. </i>

46:52.635 --> 46:55.203
They were looking
for a "bridging operation,"

46:55.334 --> 46:57.466
as they called it,

46:57.597 --> 47:00.295
the creation
of a covert airlift operation

47:00.426 --> 47:02.471
to take the place
of the CIA airlift

47:02.602 --> 47:05.257
that was hauling arms
and other supplies

47:05.387 --> 47:08.390
to the Contras
in the field in Nicaragua.

47:08.521 --> 47:11.480
<i>With Secord officially on board,</i>

47:11.611 --> 47:13.656
<i>Oliver North had
an outside channel </i>

47:13.787 --> 47:15.702
<i>that he could use to provide
logistical support </i>

47:15.833 --> 47:17.530
<i>for the Contra forces.</i>

47:17.660 --> 47:20.054
<i>Together, they would keep
the resistance alive, </i>

47:20.185 --> 47:21.839
<i>body and soul.</i>

47:21.969 --> 47:24.058
There are now three times
as many Freedom Fighters

47:24.189 --> 47:25.625
fighting the Sandinistas

47:25.755 --> 47:28.236
as there were Sandinistas
fighting Somoza.

47:30.543 --> 47:34.547
Our first requirement
was to put together a ragtag,

47:34.677 --> 47:37.332
if you will, Air Force.

47:44.992 --> 47:47.429
Our main operating base
was in El Salvador

47:47.560 --> 47:50.084
at the Ilopango Air Base.

47:52.347 --> 47:54.480
It became apparent early on

47:54.610 --> 47:55.829
that we were gonna
have to help out

47:55.960 --> 47:58.092
on the procurement
of weapons too.

47:58.223 --> 48:01.008
And so I hired
some old friends

48:01.139 --> 48:03.271
from my military days.

48:03.402 --> 48:06.492
Logistics are truly
the sinews of war.

48:06.622 --> 48:08.494
It's not just
the muscle of war.

48:08.624 --> 48:10.322
It's the beginning
and the end.

48:10.452 --> 48:13.194
If you don't have
adequate logistics,

48:13.325 --> 48:14.152
you're not going to make it.

48:16.328 --> 48:19.200
<i>By 1985,
Secord and North had developed </i>

48:19.331 --> 48:21.333
<i>a fully functioning
airline operation, </i>

48:21.463 --> 48:23.335
<i>whose sole purpose
was to deliver food </i>

48:23.465 --> 48:24.902
<i>and weapons
to the Contra forces. </i>

48:27.339 --> 48:30.385
<i>But the operation
wasn't going to fund itself. </i>

48:30.516 --> 48:32.344
<i>And with
the Boland Amendment in place, </i>

48:32.474 --> 48:34.172
<i>Congress wouldn't be
funding it either, </i>

48:34.302 --> 48:36.087
<i>at least not any time soon.</i>

48:58.848 --> 49:01.547
<i>So it was time for North
to get creative. Again. </i>

49:04.550 --> 49:07.466
Our friend and patron, the
president of the United States.

49:09.859 --> 49:13.298
One of the underappreciated
parts of this story

49:13.428 --> 49:16.344
is that even when Congress said,

49:16.475 --> 49:21.915
"We want to cut off United
States funding to the Contras,"

49:22.046 --> 49:25.223
Congress forgot
that it couldn't stop

49:25.353 --> 49:27.312
the president
of the United States

49:27.442 --> 49:30.271
from doing fundraising
on his own.

49:30.402 --> 49:32.665
I want to begin by saying
that I'm honored to be

49:32.795 --> 49:35.668
in the presence of those
who are here from Nicaragua

49:35.798 --> 49:38.236
and all the rest of you, too.

49:38.366 --> 49:40.412
<i>The Nicaraguan
Refugee Fund Dinner, </i>

49:40.542 --> 49:42.675
<i>April 1985.</i>

49:42.805 --> 49:45.330
Six years ago, many of you
were part of the fight

49:45.460 --> 49:47.419
to overthrow
an oppressive regime

49:47.549 --> 49:49.421
that had ruled
your country for decades.

49:49.551 --> 49:51.292
<i>In many ways,</i>

49:51.423 --> 49:53.294
<i>it looked like a typical
fundraising gala. </i>

49:53.425 --> 49:56.080
And she just said,
"I love you Mr. President."

49:56.210 --> 49:58.256
Isn't that nice?

49:58.386 --> 50:00.301
<i>But this gala was different,</i>

50:00.432 --> 50:02.782
<i>and it's one of the key
moments in our story, </i>

50:02.912 --> 50:04.697
<i>because it brought together
several elements </i>

50:04.827 --> 50:07.613
<i>that would set the Iran-Contra
scandal in motion. </i>

50:10.920 --> 50:13.619
<i>Shortly after the gala,
North was approached </i>

50:13.749 --> 50:15.534
<i>by two prominent
Republican fundraisers </i>

50:15.664 --> 50:17.449
<i>who had attended the event:</i>

50:17.579 --> 50:20.495
<i>Spitz Channell
and Richard Miller. </i>

50:20.626 --> 50:22.845
<i>They were interested in
raising money for the Contras </i>

50:22.976 --> 50:26.675
<i>and offered a new and more
efficient way to do it. </i>

50:26.806 --> 50:29.722
They looked around
for private donors.

50:29.852 --> 50:32.812
American anti-communists
who might be willing

50:32.942 --> 50:36.424
to give some of
their own money to the cause.

50:36.555 --> 50:39.253
<i>To North, the plan offered
a potential gold mine </i>

50:39.384 --> 50:41.429
<i>of private funds
that could be directed </i>

50:41.560 --> 50:43.475
<i>to the Contra forces
in Nicaragua. </i>

50:43.605 --> 50:47.783
He put together a slideshow,
where he showed the Sandinistas

50:47.914 --> 50:51.613
to be evil and the Contras
to be wonderful.

50:54.616 --> 50:57.793
He started meeting with donors
and giving them the slideshow

50:57.924 --> 51:00.535
and tugging on not only
their heartstrings

51:00.666 --> 51:02.363
but their purse strings
to convince them

51:02.494 --> 51:06.237
that they should be supportive
of the Contra War.

51:07.716 --> 51:09.588
He would tell them,

51:09.718 --> 51:13.548
"Federal law prohibits me
from asking you for money.

51:13.679 --> 51:15.246
"But, of course, this guy
sitting right next to me

51:15.376 --> 51:16.508
will ask you for it."

51:17.509 --> 51:20.512
And that is how
these operatives believed

51:20.642 --> 51:25.473
they were somehow
adhering to the law.

51:25.604 --> 51:29.390
That operation did serve
an important political purpose.

51:29.521 --> 51:31.914
Because anytime a reporter
like me asked,

51:32.045 --> 51:35.092
"So, where are the Contras
getting their money?"

51:35.222 --> 51:37.398
people in the Reagan
administration could say,

51:37.529 --> 51:39.879
"Well, there are these wealthy
private donors.

51:40.009 --> 51:43.578
"You need to go talk
to this lady in Dallas

51:43.709 --> 51:46.755
"or this man in Massachusetts.
These people are really worried

51:46.886 --> 51:49.671
about Nicaragua,
and they're giving the money."

51:49.802 --> 51:51.934
<i>It may have been
repetitive, but it worked. </i>

51:52.065 --> 51:55.590
<i>In 1985 alone, North
and his fundraising partners </i>

51:55.721 --> 51:58.767
<i>raised over $10 million
for the Contras. </i>

51:58.898 --> 52:02.554
<i>Flush with cash, North now had
to find a way to store it. </i>

52:02.684 --> 52:04.947
<i>For that, he turned
to Richard Secord, </i>

52:05.078 --> 52:07.428
<i>who had some experience
with this kind of thing. </i>

52:07.559 --> 52:10.039
<i>Secord created a network
of Swiss bank accounts </i>

52:10.170 --> 52:13.434
<i>that would keep operations
running smoothly and unnoticed. </i>

52:15.219 --> 52:16.742
<i>Secord referred
to this conglomerate </i>

52:16.872 --> 52:19.484
<i>simply as "The Enterprise."</i>

52:19.614 --> 52:22.182
<i>North, ever the patriot,
called it "Project Democracy." </i>

52:24.053 --> 52:25.577
<i>And, at least
for the time being, </i>

52:25.707 --> 52:28.362
<i>Congress wasn't calling it
anything at all. </i>

52:28.493 --> 52:30.538
<i>Gadafi used
to be far away, </i>

52:30.669 --> 52:32.453
<i>but now he sits
on our doorsteps </i>

52:32.584 --> 52:34.542
<i>supplying arms
and terrorist experts </i>

52:34.673 --> 52:36.457
<i>to the communisis
in Nicaragua, </i>

52:36.588 --> 52:39.025
<i>only two hours away
from our borders. </i>

52:39.156 --> 52:43.812
<i>All of this, only two hours
away from where we live. </i>

52:43.943 --> 52:45.814
<i>Support the President
on Nicaragua. </i>

52:45.945 --> 52:48.991
<i>By 1985,
Project Democracy </i>

52:49.122 --> 52:51.820
<i>was drawing from 16 different
bank accounts </i>

52:51.951 --> 52:54.910
<i>located mainly
in Switzerland. </i>

52:55.041 --> 52:58.349
We had contracts
with a number of companies

52:58.479 --> 53:01.047
throughout the world.

53:01.178 --> 53:03.832
<i>Here is terrorism
we can do something about </i>

53:03.963 --> 53:06.574
<i>if we support the President
on Nicaragua. </i>

53:09.708 --> 53:11.492
<i>The money trail
was so intricate </i>

53:11.623 --> 53:14.756
<i>that even North had
trouble following it. </i>

53:14.887 --> 53:17.672
<i>But that didn't mean
he had any problem spending it. </i>

53:20.806 --> 53:26.333
The aid itself paid for hiring
planes, pilots, trucks.

53:29.771 --> 53:33.558
<i>It enabled the U.S. government
to bribe the Honduran military </i>

53:33.688 --> 53:38.650
to continue to let the
United States use its bases.

53:38.780 --> 53:41.653
We used to call Honduras
the USS Honduras,

53:41.783 --> 53:44.830
because basically it was
a landed U.S. destroyer

53:44.960 --> 53:47.702
that was serving as a base
for the Contra War.

53:47.833 --> 53:49.748
<i>North and Secord now
had a system </i>

53:49.878 --> 53:51.750
<i>for keeping the Contras going,</i>

53:51.880 --> 53:54.100
<i>but there was still
the need for more money. </i>

53:54.231 --> 53:56.624
<i>And so they continued
to look towards Congress. </i>

53:56.755 --> 53:57.799
There is a vote
coming up in Congress

53:57.930 --> 53:59.932
of utmost importance.

54:00.062 --> 54:02.543
And I have to tell you, I need
your understanding and support.

54:04.632 --> 54:06.547
<i>After losing a vote
for Contra aid </i>

54:06.678 --> 54:09.768
<i>in April of 1985,
the Reagan Administration </i>

54:09.898 --> 54:12.901
<i>became even more determined to
overturn the Boland Amendment </i>

54:13.032 --> 54:15.643
<i>and to push Congress
to fund the Contras. </i>

54:15.774 --> 54:17.689
Now comes the crucial test

54:17.819 --> 54:20.126
for the Congress
of the United States.

54:20.257 --> 54:23.564
Will they provide the assistance
the Freedom Fighters need

54:23.695 --> 54:25.827
to deal with Russian tanks
and gunships,

54:25.958 --> 54:28.656
or will they abandon
the democratic resistance

54:28.787 --> 54:30.397
to its communist enemy?

54:30.528 --> 54:32.007
<i>To achieve this,</i>

54:32.138 --> 54:35.620
<i>they needed all the public
support they could get. </i>

54:38.840 --> 54:40.451
What the Sandinistas
have done to Nicaragua

54:40.581 --> 54:41.713
is a tragedy.

54:41.843 --> 54:43.628
But we Americans
must understand

54:43.758 --> 54:46.108
and come to grips with the fact
that the Sandinistas

54:46.239 --> 54:49.590
are not content
to brutalize their own land.

54:49.721 --> 54:51.026
They seek to export
their terror

54:51.157 --> 54:53.551
to every other country
in the region.

54:54.639 --> 54:58.512
<i>Whether it was true or not,
the media campaign worked. </i>

54:58.643 --> 55:01.167
<i>And in February of 1986,
Congress approved </i>

55:01.298 --> 55:04.997
<i>$100 million in aid
for Reagan's freedom fighters. </i>

55:05.127 --> 55:07.608
Through this aid,
we'll say to the free people

55:07.739 --> 55:10.916
of Central America,
"We will not betray you."

55:16.269 --> 55:18.663
<i>This funding package
was a landmark victory </i>

55:18.793 --> 55:21.709
<i>- for the Reagan White House.
</i>

55:21.840 --> 55:25.017
<i>And it was a badly needed
windfall for the Contras. </i>

55:25.147 --> 55:26.671
The Freedom Fighters
of Nicaragua

55:26.801 --> 55:29.151
have pinned down
the Sandinista Army

55:29.282 --> 55:31.806
and bought the people of
Central America precious time.

55:34.113 --> 55:35.897
We Americans owe them
a debt of gratitude.

55:38.073 --> 55:40.685
<i>The bridging operation
had been a success. </i>

55:40.815 --> 55:42.991
<i>With congressional aid
about to start flowing again, </i>

55:43.122 --> 55:45.124
<i>Project Democracy
had served its purpose, </i>

55:45.254 --> 55:47.561
<i>and Lieutenant Colonel
Oliver North </i>

55:47.692 --> 55:48.606
<i>had proved his mettle.</i>

55:53.088 --> 55:55.177
<i>There were other problems
on the horizon. </i>

55:55.308 --> 55:58.006
<i>But for now, Ronald Reagan
was content to focus </i>

55:58.137 --> 56:00.792
<i>on defeating communism
in Nicaragua. </i>

56:00.922 --> 56:03.055
We can succeed
in turning the tide

56:03.185 --> 56:05.536
to Democracy in Nicaragua.

56:06.667 --> 56:08.713
We must succeed.
