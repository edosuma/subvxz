WEBVTT

00:01.802 --> 00:05.370
You're kidding me, right?
No, I'm not kidding you.

00:05.405 --> 00:07.406
You've been here
three-quarters of your life,

00:07.441 --> 00:08.740
and you never once,
not even once,

00:08.775 --> 00:11.376
dipped your malasada
into your cup of coffee?

00:11.411 --> 00:12.577
Why is that so strange?

00:12.612 --> 00:14.346
I mean, I'm not saying
it's strange

00:14.381 --> 00:16.181
as much as it is just sad.

00:16.216 --> 00:17.716
I mean, you're
on this island,

00:17.751 --> 00:20.685
which is sitting on the best
coffee in the entire world--

00:20.720 --> 00:22.554
100% Kona coffee.
- Mm-hmm.

00:22.589 --> 00:25.223
Now, how do you expect to enjoy
the fusion of the flavors,

00:25.258 --> 00:26.725
the sweetness of the dough

00:26.760 --> 00:28.226
up against the bitterness
of the coffee,

00:28.261 --> 00:29.594
it's just, it's heaven, man.

00:29.629 --> 00:31.663
You know what?
I'll tell you what.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.066
Just observe.
- Okay.

00:36.803 --> 00:38.170
Mmm.

00:41.241 --> 00:43.442
(moans)

00:43.477 --> 00:45.777
(moaning)
All right. I'm gonna do it.

00:45.812 --> 00:46.745
Okay? You ready?
- Oh.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.713
All right, here we go. Like that.
- Mm-hmm.

00:48.748 --> 00:51.716
Yeah, roll that around
in your mouth.

00:51.751 --> 00:54.753
Huh? Hmm?

00:54.788 --> 00:57.389
That's pretty good. (laughs)
Damn right it's pretty good!

00:57.424 --> 00:59.791
It's pretty good, man.
Yeah, I told you.

00:59.826 --> 01:01.860
Hey, wait, whoa-whoa-whoa.
Wait a second, whatcha doing?

01:01.895 --> 01:04.663
What are you doing?
Are you double-dunking?

01:04.698 --> 01:06.798
Uh...
I'm gonna let that slide,

01:06.833 --> 01:08.667
'cause I know
you didn't know, okay?

01:08.702 --> 01:10.669
But you<i> never</i> double-dunk.

01:10.704 --> 01:12.304
Never double-dunk. Okay.
When you double-dunk,

01:12.339 --> 01:15.874
now you're messing
with the coffee-to-cake ratio.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.677
Mm-hmm.
- You're risking oversaturation,

01:18.712 --> 01:21.513
and that can lead
to the dreaded...

01:21.548 --> 01:23.148
free dive.

01:23.183 --> 01:25.750
Free dive? No, you don't want
no part of the free dive.

01:25.785 --> 01:27.853
No. No.

01:27.888 --> 01:30.889
That's where a chunk
of your malasada breaks off

01:30.924 --> 01:33.859
and just sinks right to the
bottom of your cup of coffee.

01:33.894 --> 01:37.696
And then you don't see
that nasty, soggy thing again

01:37.731 --> 01:39.698
until you're down
to the last sip.

01:39.733 --> 01:41.533
And let me tell you something.

01:41.568 --> 01:44.536
Soggy malasada--
nobody's friend.

01:44.571 --> 01:45.570
Nobody's friend. Copy.

01:45.605 --> 01:46.738
Got it. Got it.
- All right.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.773
I got to tell you
the truth, man.

01:48.808 --> 01:52.544
I mean, I don't know who it was
that invented this damn thing,

01:52.579 --> 01:54.880
but in addition
to being a genius,

01:54.915 --> 01:57.549
the man had to love coffee--
I mean, look at it.

01:57.584 --> 02:00.285
These babies are
the perfect size for dunking.

02:00.320 --> 02:03.822
Circumference is spot-on.

02:03.857 --> 02:07.692
This thing is engineered
to fit into any coffee cup.

02:07.727 --> 02:09.194
You've spent a lot of time
thinking about this,

02:09.229 --> 02:10.696
haven't you?

02:12.966 --> 02:15.834
(laughing)

02:15.869 --> 02:18.637
And that brings me to the last
item on this morning's brief--

02:18.672 --> 02:20.772
this weekend's
Honolulu Police Expo.

02:20.807 --> 02:23.441
Organizers are expecting
almost 5,000 officers

02:23.476 --> 02:24.943
from around the country.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.913
That means additional patrols.

02:27.948 --> 02:29.481
Five-O resources
if we need them.

02:29.516 --> 02:31.816
Now, officially,

02:31.851 --> 02:33.618
these mainland cops
are coming here

02:33.653 --> 02:35.320
to share techniques,

02:35.355 --> 02:37.822
to attend workshops
and test out new equipment

02:37.857 --> 02:38.857
and firearms, hmm?

02:38.892 --> 02:40.792
But unofficially,

02:40.827 --> 02:42.961
we all know
that this is an opportunity

02:42.996 --> 02:45.363
for our brothers and sisters
in blue to...

02:45.398 --> 02:46.831
have a good time, to...

02:46.866 --> 02:48.867
let off a little steam.
(laughs)

02:48.902 --> 02:50.635
GROVER: Why doesn't he
just call it what it is?

02:50.670 --> 02:51.970
Spring break for cops.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.506
If it's anything like last year.
- Oh...

02:54.541 --> 02:56.341
MEN (chanting):
Get the goat! Get the goat!

02:56.376 --> 02:58.977
LUKELA:<i> Obviously,</i>
<i>we want our fellow officers</i>

02:59.012 --> 02:59.978
<i>to have a good time...</i>

03:00.013 --> 03:01.947
up to a point.

03:01.982 --> 03:02.881
(chuckling, murmuring)

03:02.916 --> 03:04.883
But more importantly,

03:04.918 --> 03:07.686
we want everyone
to go home safe.

03:08.688 --> 03:09.754
(laughs)

03:09.789 --> 03:12.591
(chuckles):
You think that's funny, huh?

03:12.626 --> 03:13.825
All right.

03:13.860 --> 03:16.728
That, I believe,
is five times in a row.

03:16.763 --> 03:17.663
(laughs)

03:18.665 --> 03:20.865
You rig this thing?

03:20.900 --> 03:22.968
No.
- Are you sure?

03:23.003 --> 03:24.269
'Cause if you
didn't rig this thing,

03:24.304 --> 03:25.937
then it is designed
specifically--

03:25.972 --> 03:27.772
engineered--
to humiliate adults.

03:27.807 --> 03:30.442
'Cause nobody can be that lucky.
Again.

03:30.477 --> 03:32.777
Again? Yeah, 'cause I need more
whipped cream flung up my nose.

03:32.812 --> 03:34.346
This time
I'm going first, okay?

03:34.381 --> 03:34.913
Mouth.

03:36.616 --> 03:37.716
There you go.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.652
This time I'm getting you
for sure.

03:44.324 --> 03:45.523
All right.

03:45.558 --> 03:46.992
Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

03:47.994 --> 03:50.329
You're not gonna
get away with it.

03:51.798 --> 03:52.998
(both laugh)

03:53.033 --> 03:55.500
Really? I mean, look at this.

03:55.535 --> 03:57.636
This is ridiculous.

03:57.671 --> 04:00.372
(explosion in distance)

04:01.708 --> 04:02.907
Daddy, what was that?

04:02.942 --> 04:04.709
I don't know, buddy.
Sit right here.

04:04.744 --> 04:05.410
I'll go find out,
all right?

04:05.445 --> 04:08.280
(car alarms blaring in distance)

04:18.958 --> 04:22.261
<i>(Hawaii Five-O</i>
theme song plays)

04:45.985 --> 04:47.953
Captioned by Media Access
Group at WGBH access.wgbh.org

04:49.989 --> 04:51.589
NEWSWOMAN: The explosion
devastated the offices

04:51.624 --> 04:53.091
of local law firm,
Hadley and Becker.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.759
Rescue and recovery teams...

04:54.794 --> 04:57.095
Oh, hey, let me give you a hand there.
- Oh. Gently, please.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.930
The cause of the blast
is unknown,

04:58.965 --> 05:01.666
but we are hearing reports
of at least one casualty.

05:01.701 --> 05:03.702
Much easier
with two people.

05:05.038 --> 05:07.038
(sighs):
Ah. Mahalo, Jerry.

05:07.073 --> 05:09.841
No sweat. Here are
the boxes you asked for.

05:09.876 --> 05:11.843
I got another half dozen
in my van if you need them.

05:11.878 --> 05:13.044
Um, actually...

05:13.079 --> 05:14.979
that should not
be necessary.

05:15.014 --> 05:17.682
Um, if my calculations
are correct,

05:17.717 --> 05:19.751
the rest of my possessions
should fit perfectly

05:19.786 --> 05:22.087
in these seven remaining boxes.
Okay, then...

05:22.122 --> 05:25.123
let the packing commence.
Where do you want me?

05:25.158 --> 05:27.926
Oh, um... yeah, you could start
on those shelves over there.

05:27.961 --> 05:30.028
Check.

05:30.063 --> 05:33.065
(popping bubbles)

05:34.067 --> 05:36.401
(continues
popping bubbles)

05:37.904 --> 05:39.037
(laughs):
Oh. Sorry.

05:42.442 --> 05:44.376
Hello. What have we here?

05:44.411 --> 05:46.010
Max, what are these?

05:46.045 --> 05:48.012
Oh, um, those are
my daily journals.

05:48.047 --> 05:49.914
What? Get out.
You keep a journal?

05:49.949 --> 05:52.551
Yes, since I was
eight years old.

05:53.052 --> 05:55.354
Whoa.

05:57.924 --> 06:00.024
You're like John Doe in<i> Se7en</i>
meets Doogie Howser.

06:00.059 --> 06:01.526
What do you write about?

06:01.561 --> 06:03.461
Anything. Everything.
My thoughts.

06:03.496 --> 06:04.863
Insights into
the human condition.

06:04.898 --> 06:07.799
Wow. Really?

06:07.834 --> 06:09.067
D-Do you mind if I...

06:09.102 --> 06:11.103
If it'll keep you quiet, please.

06:12.138 --> 06:13.572
Good.

06:20.647 --> 06:22.046
(engine turns off)

06:22.081 --> 06:24.082
(indistinct radio chatter)

06:31.991 --> 06:35.960
CHIN: DHS just left.
No sign of radioactivity.

06:35.995 --> 06:37.162
Whatever caused this,
it doesn't appear

06:37.197 --> 06:38.530
to be connected
to our missing uranium.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.899
That's a silver lining,
I guess.

06:40.934 --> 06:43.468
DANNY: Except for the fact that
the stuff's still out there.

06:43.503 --> 06:45.170
Tell us about the body
they found, Chin.

06:45.205 --> 06:47.672
Well, rescue and recovery
team had dogs

06:47.707 --> 06:49.541
scouring the rubble
looking for survivors,

06:49.576 --> 06:50.975
and they actually
picked up a scent.

06:51.010 --> 06:52.177
Except that the body
that they found

06:52.212 --> 06:53.578
wasn't actually someone
who was caught

06:53.613 --> 06:55.547
in the explosion.
Who was it, then?

06:55.582 --> 06:57.715
He's a police sergeant
from Milwaukee

06:57.750 --> 06:59.684
by the name of Miles Barton.

06:59.719 --> 07:01.219
He's in town for the convention.

07:01.254 --> 07:04.823
According to HPD, there are
over a dozen out-of-town cops in

07:04.858 --> 07:05.957
from all different cities

07:05.992 --> 07:07.592
here to help search
for survivors.

07:07.627 --> 07:09.227
Barton was one of them--
except his C.O.D.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.728
was a deep stab wound.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.197
No such thing
as an off-duty cop.

07:12.232 --> 07:14.065
Yeah. Body's
actually down there.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.233
CSU found gravitational
blood spatter

07:15.268 --> 07:17.202
on the ground,
so the thinking is

07:17.237 --> 07:19.771
he was knifed up here
and then tossed into that hole.

07:19.806 --> 07:22.207
To stall discovery of the body.
Mm-hmm.

07:22.242 --> 07:24.476
All these other volunteers,

07:24.511 --> 07:25.844
nobody saw anything?
Nothing yet.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.078
But we're still
questioning people.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.147
All right, thanks, Chin.
Take a look.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.019
(panting)

07:36.155 --> 07:37.989
Noelani.

07:38.024 --> 07:39.123
Commander.

07:39.158 --> 07:41.192
Detective.
- What do you got?

07:41.227 --> 07:43.261
(sighs) Well... the shape
and depth of the wound

07:43.296 --> 07:45.797
indicate the victim was
definitely stabbed with a knife.

07:45.832 --> 07:47.265
There's also some trauma
to the body,

07:47.300 --> 07:48.800
fractured skull,
some broken ribs.

07:48.835 --> 07:51.803
But, given the nature
of the contusions

07:51.838 --> 07:53.505
and the position of the body,
I believe

07:53.540 --> 07:55.106
these injuries were sustained
when he fell down here.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.141
Got it.

07:57.176 --> 07:58.977
Noelani.

07:59.012 --> 08:01.279
Yep?
- Anybody from your team

08:01.314 --> 08:03.047
been down here yet?

08:03.082 --> 08:04.048
Not yet.

08:04.083 --> 08:06.585
STEVE: Danny, come here
for a minute, will you?

08:09.255 --> 08:10.855
What do you got?

08:10.890 --> 08:12.958
Fresh tracks.

08:22.569 --> 08:24.869
Someone came
all the way down here

08:24.904 --> 08:26.170
after the building came down.

08:26.205 --> 08:29.274
Maybe somebody
looking for survivors?

08:29.309 --> 08:31.176
I don't think so.

08:42.121 --> 08:44.122
(indistinct chatter)

08:47.660 --> 08:50.161
The vault's used to store
my firm's most important files.

08:50.196 --> 08:51.963
Ones relating
to open cases,

08:51.998 --> 08:53.932
as well as documents
that are sensitive in nature.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.300
Can you think
of anybody who'd want

08:55.335 --> 08:56.935
to get their hands
on those files?

08:56.970 --> 08:59.103
It would certainly be valuable
to opposing counsel.

08:59.138 --> 09:01.306
Or someone who wanted
to gather information

09:01.341 --> 09:02.307
on a client, I suppose.

09:02.342 --> 09:05.009
I wish I could tell you
exactly what was stolen,

09:05.044 --> 09:07.345
but from what I've been told,
it could be some time

09:07.380 --> 09:09.180
before it's deemed safe
to go in.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.015
And even then we're talking
thousands of files.

09:11.050 --> 09:14.052
It could days, if not weeks,
to do a full inventory.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.186
STEVE: All right,
listen, thanks very much.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.888
We appreciate your time.
Of course.

09:16.923 --> 09:18.089
And if there's
anything I could do

09:18.124 --> 09:19.357
to help with
your investigation,

09:19.392 --> 09:21.726
please let me know.
Yeah, man, we will. Thanks.

09:21.761 --> 09:23.861
This is obviously
not an accident.

09:23.896 --> 09:25.897
No one watches
a tower come down

09:25.932 --> 09:27.932
and sees an opportunity
to steal a bunch of files.

09:27.967 --> 09:29.267
No.

09:29.302 --> 09:30.868
Hey.

09:30.903 --> 09:33.605
Hey. So the fire inspector
confirms that the explosion

09:33.640 --> 09:35.907
was caused by a gas
leak, but he thinks

09:35.942 --> 09:37.075
it wasn't just
a simple accident.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.343
Okay, what do you got?

09:38.378 --> 09:40.345
They found drilling equipment
underground.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.747
So it looks like there
was actually a heist crew

09:42.782 --> 09:44.015
that was tunneling
toward the basement,

09:44.050 --> 09:45.917
they hit the gas main,
and that's what caused

09:45.952 --> 09:47.619
the explosion.
- Okay.

09:47.654 --> 09:48.887
So whoever did this
obviously took off

09:48.922 --> 09:51.656
when their plan went sideways,
and they came back this morning.

09:51.691 --> 09:52.757
Right. They could
have been dressed

09:52.792 --> 09:53.758
as volunteer rescue workers.

09:53.793 --> 09:55.059
As soon as they
get underground,

09:55.094 --> 09:56.761
they go after
what they came here for

09:56.796 --> 09:57.929
in the first place.

09:57.964 --> 09:58.897
Our vic sees them
as they're coming out.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.932
Gunshot would have drawn
too much attention,

10:00.967 --> 10:03.635
so instead they knife him,
toss him in the hole.

10:03.670 --> 10:05.103
Well, security cameras
are obviously buried,

10:05.138 --> 10:07.105
so that's not gonna be any help.
- Wait a minute.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.940
Every news channel
on this island

10:08.975 --> 10:11.943
had a camera crew right here
an hour after the explosion.

10:11.978 --> 10:14.078
Yeah, it's possible that
one of them could've seen

10:14.113 --> 10:15.046
our perps as they
were leaving last night.

10:15.081 --> 10:16.648
I'll go over and talk to them,
see if I can

10:16.683 --> 10:17.949
get you copies of their footage.

10:17.984 --> 10:18.950
All right.

10:18.985 --> 10:21.252
The shockwave from the blast
was felt for miles

10:21.287 --> 10:23.121
around the Honolulu area.

10:23.156 --> 10:24.456
Damage to the building
is extensive

10:24.491 --> 10:26.958
and will run well into the tens
of millions (surfboard bangs)

10:26.993 --> 10:28.026
of dollars.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.994
Witnesses at the scene
describe...

10:30.029 --> 10:31.896
(chuckles quietly)

10:38.037 --> 10:40.138
(chuckles) Much obliged.
Frank Bama.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.773
Man, I didn't know
you were in town.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.141
Well...

10:43.176 --> 10:44.876
I had a little problem
with a client

10:44.911 --> 10:46.978
turned out to be a budding warlord.
- Oh.

10:47.013 --> 10:49.347
Threatened to cut my head off
if I didn't fly for him.

10:49.382 --> 10:50.948
Ew.
- Yeah, so...

10:50.983 --> 10:53.151
I decided it was time
for a little R&R.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.419
Good thinking.
- So, your boss,

10:54.454 --> 10:56.254
uh, offered up his couch.

10:56.289 --> 10:59.824
It was economically desirable,
so here I am.

10:59.859 --> 11:00.992
Well, it's good to see you.

11:01.027 --> 11:02.393
Likewise.
Hey, you don't mind

11:02.428 --> 11:04.028
if I leave my gun
over there, do you?

11:04.063 --> 11:05.029
No.

11:05.064 --> 11:05.963
Okay, yeah, I'm gonna

11:05.999 --> 11:07.732
go across the street
and get a little poke.

11:07.767 --> 11:08.800
Fine by me.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.334
All right. Oh, look at that.

11:10.369 --> 11:13.104
That's some big-time
destruction right there.

11:13.139 --> 11:14.305
Yeah.

11:14.340 --> 11:18.042
That have anything to do with
that, uh, missing uranium?

11:18.077 --> 11:20.078
Hey, how'd you know about that?

11:20.113 --> 11:23.748
Um, I might've overheard
McGarrett saying something

11:23.783 --> 11:25.149
about it on the
phone this morning.

11:25.184 --> 11:26.117
Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:26.152 --> 11:28.152
Well, stop overhearing stuff.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.987
And whatever you do,

11:30.022 --> 11:33.057
please, do not mention the words
"missing uranium" to anybody.

11:33.092 --> 11:34.926
Okay. Keep it on the QT.

11:34.961 --> 11:36.094
Yeah.
- Roger that.

11:36.129 --> 11:37.228
You know, my hearing's

11:37.263 --> 11:38.896
not what it used to be, anyway.

11:38.931 --> 11:40.164
Good.
- Too many hours with my keister

11:40.199 --> 11:42.300
parked next
to a turboshaft engine.

11:42.335 --> 11:43.001
Mm.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.103
Okay. Good to see you, big man.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.138
You, too, Frank. All right, bye.
All right. Take care.

11:48.775 --> 11:50.108
(chuckles softly)

11:52.345 --> 11:55.313
Well, I'm glad that you find
my intimate recollections

11:55.348 --> 11:57.982
so engrossing,
but I was under the impression

11:58.017 --> 12:00.118
that you came here
to help pack.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.086
Yeah, yeah,
I'll get right on that.

12:02.121 --> 12:04.021
This is amazing stuff.
I mean, it says here

12:04.056 --> 12:05.990
McGarrett was a fugitive
for a couple days?

12:06.025 --> 12:08.926
Ah, yes. That was
an unfortunate misunderstanding.

12:08.961 --> 12:10.828
Whoa, hold up.
He came to you for help?

12:10.863 --> 12:11.896
That is correct.

12:12.899 --> 12:16.200
Hey, I'm sorry I broke
into your house. I, uh...

12:16.235 --> 12:18.503
I didn't really have
anywhere else to go.

12:18.538 --> 12:20.204
No apology is necessary.

12:20.239 --> 12:23.407
In fact, I'm quite humbled
that you feel comfortable enough

12:23.442 --> 12:25.409
to come to me.
However,

12:25.444 --> 12:29.514
I am curious as to how
you acquired that wound.

12:29.549 --> 12:32.517
I'm guessing that it
was a crudely sharpened

12:32.552 --> 12:35.853
piece of unsterilized metal...

12:35.888 --> 12:37.221
I got shanked in prison, Max.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.023
Oh.

12:39.058 --> 12:40.858
I suppose that one might have
a problem with a fugitive

12:40.893 --> 12:42.160
seeking shelter in their home.

12:42.195 --> 12:45.130
But truth be told,
I was moved.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.166
Up until that point,
our relationship was

12:48.201 --> 12:50.334
strictly professional.

12:50.369 --> 12:52.904
Commander McGarrett
was taking a huge risk.

12:52.939 --> 12:55.206
I was a sworn member
of law enforcement, and I was

12:55.241 --> 12:56.908
duty-bound to turn him in.

12:56.943 --> 13:00.211
He knew that,
yet he still came to me.

13:00.246 --> 13:02.046
He trusted me.

13:02.081 --> 13:04.982
I saw him as a colleague,
but he saw me as a friend.

13:05.017 --> 13:07.819
Wow, that's touching, dude.

13:07.854 --> 13:09.053
Truly.

13:13.359 --> 13:15.259
Is that
the dead guy

13:15.294 --> 13:16.460
from the explosion?

13:16.495 --> 13:19.931
I assume so.

13:23.035 --> 13:24.468
Something wrong?

13:24.503 --> 13:27.271
Hmm? Um, no. I...

13:27.306 --> 13:30.608
just realized that this might be
the last postmortem

13:30.643 --> 13:32.143
I get to conduct.

13:32.178 --> 13:34.179
Okay.

13:35.514 --> 13:37.916
Hope it's a good one.

13:44.123 --> 13:46.357

HIRSCH: Crime Clean.
Cleaning up the streets

13:53.966 --> 13:55.166
one crime at a time.

13:55.201 --> 13:56.100
Thanks, man.

13:56.135 --> 13:57.268
Not interested.
- Oh,

13:57.303 --> 13:59.036
but you should be.

13:59.071 --> 14:01.239
Sadly, as well as you guys do
your job,

14:01.274 --> 14:03.007
we will always have crime.

14:03.042 --> 14:04.275
Upside?

14:04.310 --> 14:06.110
There will always be
crime scenes.

14:06.145 --> 14:08.279
This is
a guaranteed revenue stream.

14:08.314 --> 14:12.250
In fact, not only is
my business recession-proof,

14:12.285 --> 14:15.419
I actually do a little better
in downtimes.

14:15.454 --> 14:17.288
Oh, well,
what do you know,

14:17.323 --> 14:19.423
it's Commander McGarrett
and Officer Kalakaua

14:19.458 --> 14:21.158
of the Five-O
task force.

14:21.193 --> 14:23.027
I work a lot
of their crime scenes.

14:23.062 --> 14:27.431
In fact, you could say we're
practically work colleagues.

14:27.466 --> 14:29.233
We have no affiliation
with this man.

14:29.268 --> 14:31.969
He's, uh... he's very sorry
to bother you officers,

14:32.004 --> 14:34.105
and we hope that you enjoy
your stay in Hawaii.

14:34.140 --> 14:36.240
Aloha.

14:36.275 --> 14:37.575
I was just about

14:37.610 --> 14:39.977
to close that sale.
No, you weren't.

14:40.012 --> 14:41.345
Listen, we need
some information.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.981
KONO: Look, with all
the crime scenes that you troll

14:44.016 --> 14:46.150
looking for work,
have you ever come across

14:46.185 --> 14:48.286
a stringer that goes by the name
G Stealth?

14:48.321 --> 14:50.321
Oh, sure. I know him well.

14:50.356 --> 14:52.423
Oh, excellent. We believe he
sold footage of that building

14:52.458 --> 14:54.325
explosion last night
to a local news station.

14:54.360 --> 14:56.294
So we're gonna need
his real name.

14:56.329 --> 14:57.695
That I don't know.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.997
Okay. How do
we get ahold of him?

15:00.032 --> 15:01.198
Couldn't tell you that, either.

15:01.233 --> 15:02.500
Hmm.
- You-you...

15:02.535 --> 15:04.535
you literally just said
you know him well.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.570
Okay, maybe not that well.

15:06.605 --> 15:08.539
But we do bump into each other

15:08.574 --> 15:10.508
at the occasional
double homicide.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.677
Sometimes
we even

15:12.712 --> 15:14.211
knock back a few afterward.

15:14.246 --> 15:16.080
You know, to wind down.

15:16.115 --> 15:18.215
Hey, you
know what,

15:18.250 --> 15:20.318
one time,
we hit up this karaoke place.

15:20.353 --> 15:23.321
Stealthy pounded
a few too many sake bombs,

15:23.356 --> 15:24.555
and I had to give him a lift
home.

15:24.590 --> 15:25.723
STEVE:
Okay. Terrific.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.291
You remember
where you dropped him off?

15:27.326 --> 15:30.428
Hmm. I'm not sure.

15:30.463 --> 15:33.431
But you know
what might jog my memory?

15:33.466 --> 15:35.299
What?
Uh, if you guys

15:35.334 --> 15:39.737
offered me an exclusive contract
to clean up Five-O's

15:39.772 --> 15:41.405
crime scenes.
- Oh.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.407
That's an idea.
- Yeah.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.743
Or how 'bout this one?
If you cooperate,

15:45.778 --> 15:47.712
we won't shut down
your sales booths

15:47.747 --> 15:51.248
or fine you for operating
without a permit.

15:51.283 --> 15:53.451
That's really good advice.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.586
Let's go.

15:58.324 --> 16:01.525
O-Okay. You want
to take a right up here.

16:01.560 --> 16:03.527
Th-This definitely
looks familiar.

16:03.562 --> 16:05.396
You said that
an hour ago.

16:05.431 --> 16:09.667
Well, I'm quite confident
that this is the general area.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.369
Maybe.
- Let me tell you something.

16:11.404 --> 16:13.004
There's gonna be a
crime scene cleanup

16:13.039 --> 16:14.405
in this truck
if you don't remember

16:14.440 --> 16:16.107
which house it is, all right?

16:16.142 --> 16:18.042
Wait. That-that's it.

16:18.077 --> 16:20.678
The one with the hula girl
mailbox-- I'm sure that's where

16:20.713 --> 16:22.380
I dropped him off.
All right.

16:24.784 --> 16:26.417
Okay, how sure?

16:26.452 --> 16:27.318
HIRSCH:

16:27.353 --> 16:30.054
ni... ninety-five percent.

16:30.089 --> 16:31.389
Works for me.

16:33.392 --> 16:36.093
Oh, by the way, this
should go without saying,

16:36.128 --> 16:38.396
but you do not leave this
vehicle, you understand?

16:38.431 --> 16:41.232
Got it.
Oh, and I should warn you,

16:41.267 --> 16:44.402
uh, Stealthy has a couple
of, uh, outstanding warrants

16:44.437 --> 16:46.037
on his head--
just trespassing

16:46.072 --> 16:47.471
and whatnot.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.673
He might not be so happy
to see you.

16:49.708 --> 16:51.609
Okay, and you wait until now
to mention this?

16:51.644 --> 16:53.411
Uh, sorry. Small oversight.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.492
G-Stealth! Five-O!

17:08.527 --> 17:09.627
Open up!

17:19.672 --> 17:21.039
Five-O!

17:22.408 --> 17:24.208
(sighs)

17:25.845 --> 17:28.379
(clacking nearby)
(exhaling)

17:28.414 --> 17:30.548
Oh.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.450
Not good.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.127
(honking horn)

17:44.697 --> 17:46.430
G-STEALTH:
Hirsch? What the hell

17:46.465 --> 17:48.532
are you doing here?

17:48.567 --> 17:50.267
Hey, buddy.
You son of a bitch.

17:50.302 --> 17:51.402
You ratted me out?
- Uh...

17:51.437 --> 17:52.636
well...
- Whatever.

17:52.671 --> 17:54.538
Just go! Drive!

17:54.573 --> 17:55.273
Now!

17:58.677 --> 18:00.578
(car alarm blaring)

18:00.613 --> 18:02.513
Oops.

18:02.548 --> 18:04.549
(alarm continues blaring)

18:06.318 --> 18:07.618
Nice going, Hirsch.

18:15.494 --> 18:17.628
G-Stealth's footage
give us anything yet?

18:17.663 --> 18:19.763
We're just going through it now.
It's about 40 minutes of tape.

18:19.798 --> 18:22.166
What about you?
Well, I looked into that

18:22.201 --> 18:23.801
drilling equipment that
was recovered from the scene,

18:23.836 --> 18:25.669
but unfortunately,
it was a dead end.

18:25.704 --> 18:28.239
Those tools were stolen from
a construction site a week ago.

18:29.475 --> 18:31.809
(siren wailing)

18:31.844 --> 18:33.310
Hang on a sec.

18:33.345 --> 18:35.880
Guys, look at this.

18:35.915 --> 18:39.717
You see these rescue vehicles
arriving on scene?

18:39.752 --> 18:41.552
Check out the one
in the back.

18:41.587 --> 18:44.321
STEVE: Those are taillights.
He's pulling out.

18:44.356 --> 18:46.190
Doesn't look like a first
responder vehicle, either.

18:46.225 --> 18:47.458
Could be the perp's
fleeing the scene.

18:47.493 --> 18:48.859
Yeah, I'm gonna
enhance it and see

18:48.894 --> 18:50.595
if I can get a look
at that plate.

18:55.367 --> 18:57.201
G-N-U-5-5-6.

18:57.236 --> 18:58.636
Who's it registered to, Kono?

19:01.607 --> 19:02.873
Jimmy Rorke.

19:02.908 --> 19:06.243
He was pinched
for grand theft and B&E.

19:06.278 --> 19:07.512
We got an address on this guy?

19:21.627 --> 19:23.461
Guys, come on back here.

19:25.764 --> 19:27.565
Apparently,
Rorke had

19:27.600 --> 19:31.268
an accomplice--
but from the looks of things,

19:31.303 --> 19:32.937
he must have sustained
these wounds in a blast.

19:32.972 --> 19:35.339
Obviously, Rorke didn't want
to take him to the hospital.

19:35.374 --> 19:36.307
Chin.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.275
(sighs)
No I.D.

19:38.310 --> 19:40.611
All right, let's run this guy's
prints through the system.

19:40.646 --> 19:43.447
Get CSU down here to tear this
place apart so they can find

19:43.482 --> 19:46.384
something to tell us
where Rorke is.

19:48.320 --> 19:49.987
Jerry...

19:50.022 --> 19:51.155
(shushing)

19:51.190 --> 19:53.591
It's getting good now. Well,
I'm sorry to disturb you,

19:53.626 --> 19:55.526
but if you're not gonna
help me pack my belongings,

19:55.561 --> 19:58.362
could I at least ask you
to try to stay out of my way?

19:58.397 --> 20:00.231
Hmm? Hmm?

20:00.266 --> 20:02.366
Oh. Sorry.

20:05.738 --> 20:08.339
The way you and Sabrina met,

20:08.374 --> 20:10.774
it was classic-- it's, like,
right out of a rom-com.

20:10.809 --> 20:13.644
Yes, I believe they
call it a "meet-cute."

20:13.679 --> 20:16.647
I'm right at the part where
you're about to ask her out.

20:16.682 --> 20:17.781
WOMAN: Next please.
Oh.

20:17.816 --> 20:19.217
Window three's open.

20:23.422 --> 20:25.389
Next customer, please.

20:26.458 --> 20:27.491
Aloha, Max.

20:27.526 --> 20:28.559
Aloha, Sabrina.

20:28.594 --> 20:30.327
Another deposit?

20:30.362 --> 20:31.829
Must be Friday.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.998
You know, Max,
you can always

20:34.033 --> 20:36.000
set your account up
for direct deposit, and that way

20:36.035 --> 20:38.669
you won't have the hassle of
coming in the bank every week.

20:38.704 --> 20:41.839
Mm. Your time-saving assessment
is quite correct.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.741
I've had this thought myself,

20:43.776 --> 20:45.509
but eventually decided
against it.

20:45.544 --> 20:47.411
Oh, yeah? Why's that?
FBI crime data

20:47.446 --> 20:50.914
shows a spike in Internet
banking fraud, most notably

20:50.949 --> 20:53.550
in direct deposit scams,

20:53.585 --> 20:55.519
which is turning out
to be quite troublesome.

20:55.554 --> 20:57.521
Here I thought the reason
you came in every week

20:57.556 --> 20:58.756
was to see me.
- It is.

20:58.791 --> 21:00.291
Oh! Uh...

21:00.326 --> 21:02.359
I-I-I... I mean, uh,

21:02.394 --> 21:03.727
uh, y-yes, you...

21:03.762 --> 21:05.296
are the reason why I come in.

21:05.331 --> 21:08.832
I was just looking, uh, for a...
the right moment

21:08.867 --> 21:11.502
to ask you...
for your...

21:12.705 --> 21:15.473
...for your phone number.

21:17.543 --> 21:19.076
I'm free on Saturday.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.545
I was thinking maybe
we could get some sushi?

21:22.614 --> 21:23.614
Yes.

21:23.649 --> 21:26.450
Uh, how would
8:00 be? I know

21:26.485 --> 21:29.486
of a great sushi place,
uh, serves r-raw fish,

21:29.521 --> 21:31.388
(distorts, echoes)
uh, with rice...

21:31.423 --> 21:33.524
Wow, so you just went for it.

21:33.559 --> 21:35.959
I did. Truth be told,
I wasn't aware

21:35.994 --> 21:38.329
I was capable of such bravery.

21:38.364 --> 21:40.798
Yeah, me, too.
So where'd that come from?

21:40.833 --> 21:43.367
Actually, Officer Kalakaua--
she suggested that I man up

21:43.402 --> 21:44.535
and put myself out there.

21:44.570 --> 21:46.437
So I followed her counsel
to a T,

21:46.472 --> 21:49.106
and the results exceeded
my wildest expectations.

21:49.141 --> 21:52.443
Of course, Sabrina got shot
moments later and nearly died.

21:52.478 --> 21:55.045
However, the experience did bring
us together. Okay, first of all,

21:55.080 --> 21:57.047
spoiler alert.

21:57.082 --> 21:59.049
But second,
you owe Kono big-time.

21:59.084 --> 22:02.720
I... I suppose I do.

22:02.755 --> 22:04.054
Now if you'll excuse me,

22:04.089 --> 22:05.890
I need to see
what happens next.

22:08.427 --> 22:10.394
CHIN:
<i>So, CSU</i>

22:10.429 --> 22:11.628
just finished going
through the trash.

22:11.663 --> 22:14.131
They found two pairs
of coveralls.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.399
Wait a minute.

22:15.434 --> 22:17.568
Rorke had two accomplices.
- Mm-hmm.

22:17.603 --> 22:19.937
And we just got an I.D. back
on the guy in the van.

22:19.972 --> 22:21.638
His name is Leo Stein.
No priors,

22:21.673 --> 22:22.873
but his prints were
in the system

22:22.908 --> 22:24.575
because he used to clerk
for a federal judge.

22:24.610 --> 22:26.643
How does somebody like that
become a criminal?

22:26.678 --> 22:28.078
I don't know,
but here's the best part.

22:28.113 --> 22:29.146
Until very recently,

22:29.181 --> 22:31.415
he worked at the law offices
of Hadley & Becker.

22:31.450 --> 22:33.951
Which means he could have known
what was in that safe.

22:33.986 --> 22:35.419
Maybe he was the inside man.

22:35.454 --> 22:37.421
Hey.
- Hey.

22:37.456 --> 22:38.589
I just got back
Rorke's phone records.

22:38.624 --> 22:39.757
You ready for this?
- Yeah.

22:39.792 --> 22:42.426
8:00 this morning,
he makes a 40-second call

22:42.461 --> 22:43.927
to Brian Hadley's cell phone.

22:43.962 --> 22:47.431
So Rorke and his partners steal
something out of Hadley's safe,

22:47.466 --> 22:49.433
and then they call Hadley.

22:49.468 --> 22:51.602
STEVE:
Yeah, which, uh, Hadley

22:51.637 --> 22:52.970
conveniently forgets
to tell Danny and I

22:53.005 --> 22:54.438
when we spoke to him.

22:54.473 --> 22:55.672
So, then, is it just me,

22:55.708 --> 22:58.475
or is this starting to look
more like an extortion attempt?

22:58.510 --> 22:59.676
That's ridiculous.

22:59.711 --> 23:01.645
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

23:01.680 --> 23:02.846
No one has attempted

23:02.881 --> 23:04.882
to blackmail me
or any of my clients.

23:04.917 --> 23:06.183
We have

23:06.218 --> 23:08.185
phone records that
suggest otherwise.

23:08.220 --> 23:11.088
Why don't you just
let us help you?

23:11.123 --> 23:12.590
All right, we can help you.

23:14.626 --> 23:16.693
If it were up to me,
I would let you,

23:16.728 --> 23:19.029
but my client doesn't want
to involve the authorities.

23:19.064 --> 23:21.565
Ah. - They'd prefer to
resolve this on their own.

23:21.600 --> 23:24.468
Uh-huh. - Which, by the way, is
perfectly legal for them to do.

23:24.503 --> 23:27.471
Okay, look, why don't you just

23:27.506 --> 23:30.107
tell us the name of your client?

23:30.142 --> 23:31.875
We'll go talk to them,
gently persuade them.

23:31.910 --> 23:33.877
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

23:33.912 --> 23:35.712
Attorney-client privilege
prevents me

23:35.747 --> 23:37.548
from shar...
- Wait. Wait. Attorney-client privilege?

23:37.583 --> 23:40.184
A cop was murdered. You
understand that, right? - Yes.

23:40.219 --> 23:41.318
And I'm sorry
that that happened.

23:41.354 --> 23:43.120
Believe me, I want to help...
I don't think you are.

23:43.155 --> 23:44.455
I don't think you are
sorry, all right?

23:44.490 --> 23:45.689
You're obstructing
an investigation.

23:45.724 --> 23:46.823
You understand that?

23:46.859 --> 23:48.725
Why don't you just tell us
what the hell is going on?

23:48.760 --> 23:50.961
(sighs)

23:50.996 --> 23:54.131
Again, that information
is confidential.

23:54.166 --> 23:56.133
Not only am I within my rights

23:56.168 --> 23:58.635
to protect my client's
interests.

23:58.670 --> 24:00.137
I could be disbarred for

24:00.172 --> 24:03.007
cooperating with you.
All right. I understand.

24:04.510 --> 24:05.476
Book him, Danno.

24:05.511 --> 24:07.812
Absolutely. Come on. - (scoffs)

24:17.256 --> 24:18.122
I'm afraid I'm gonna

24:18.157 --> 24:20.791
have to take that.
Oh! Five more minutes!

24:20.826 --> 24:21.792
Jerry.

24:21.827 --> 24:23.828
(groans)

24:28.867 --> 24:30.767
Well, look at
that. We're done.

24:30.802 --> 24:32.870
I got to say,
reading some of your diaries,

24:32.905 --> 24:36.006
I see Max Bergman
in a whole new light.

24:36.041 --> 24:38.141
But there's something
I've been dying to ask you.

24:38.176 --> 24:40.511
You mention your prehistoric
fossil collection and your

24:40.546 --> 24:42.813
DS9 action figures a few times.

24:42.848 --> 24:44.681
They were obviously
important to you.

24:44.716 --> 24:46.183
That would be correct.

24:46.218 --> 24:47.117
So why did you sell 'em?

24:47.153 --> 24:51.789
It was a sacrifice
for a larger purpose.

24:52.858 --> 24:54.858
Well, don't leave me hanging.

24:54.893 --> 24:56.894
Very well.

24:56.929 --> 24:58.996
(engine revving)

25:00.566 --> 25:03.234
(indistinct crowd chatter)

25:09.241 --> 25:11.241
(squeaking)

25:11.276 --> 25:12.776
(car alarm chirps on)

25:12.811 --> 25:13.911
Gentlemen.

25:13.946 --> 25:16.079
What are you doing here, Max?

25:16.114 --> 25:17.314
Got a new car.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.783
Yes, I did, and thank you

25:19.818 --> 25:21.218
for noticing.

25:21.253 --> 25:22.753
Unfortunately,
in order to purchase

25:22.788 --> 25:24.321
a sweet ride like this--

25:24.356 --> 25:27.291
it necessitated me to sell off
my entire prehistoric fossil

25:27.326 --> 25:29.326
collection and my
DS9 action figures.

25:29.361 --> 25:34.298
However, I feel it
was well very worth it.

25:34.333 --> 25:35.265
Why'd you go with a Camaro?

25:35.300 --> 25:36.633
Well to be honest,

25:36.668 --> 25:38.035
it was because of
Detective Williams.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.637
What do you mean?
- Well, I guess in some ways,

25:40.672 --> 25:42.205
you can say I've always
looked up to him.

25:42.240 --> 25:43.974
Really?
- Yes.

25:44.009 --> 25:45.976
Detective Williams
may have a gruff exterior,

25:46.011 --> 25:48.312
but underneath is
a very caring individual.

25:48.347 --> 25:50.213
I mean, considering
the sacrifice he made

25:50.248 --> 25:51.882
for his daughter
by moving out here,

25:51.917 --> 25:54.284
or the fact
that he gave up a piece of his

25:54.319 --> 25:56.186
vital organ without hesitation

25:56.221 --> 25:58.255
in order
to save Commander McGarrett.

25:58.290 --> 26:00.223
And at times,
he can be quite witty.

26:00.258 --> 26:03.594
Max, can I ask you something?
Of course.

26:03.629 --> 26:05.629
Have you ever mentioned any
of this to Detective Williams?

26:05.664 --> 26:07.364
No. That would be inappropriate.

26:07.399 --> 26:08.966
What? Sharing your feelings?

26:09.001 --> 26:11.368
Telling the people in your
life what they mean to you?

26:11.403 --> 26:12.869
How is that inappropriate?

26:12.904 --> 26:14.738
Well, perhaps you're right,

26:14.773 --> 26:16.807
but it's just something
I'm not comfortable with.

26:16.842 --> 26:18.642
Oh, I get that.

26:18.677 --> 26:20.077
It isn't easy for you,

26:20.112 --> 26:22.245
but you're going to
have to get past that.

26:22.280 --> 26:24.314
You're not going to be
working with stiffs anymore.

26:24.349 --> 26:26.216
You're going to be
interacting with living,

26:26.251 --> 26:28.085
breathing people
on a daily basis.

26:28.120 --> 26:30.754
Gonna have to learn to open up
and share your feelings.

26:30.789 --> 26:32.923
Trust me. It's a good thing.

26:32.958 --> 26:35.926
GROVER:
<i>Well, I think we've just</i>

26:35.961 --> 26:37.728
I.D.'d the blackmail target.

26:37.763 --> 26:39.730
Meet Edward Gabler.

26:39.765 --> 26:41.264
This guy withdrew

26:41.299 --> 26:42.633
$2 million in cash

26:42.668 --> 26:44.401
from four different banks
this afternoon.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.837
Plus, he's also
been trading calls

26:46.872 --> 26:48.905
with his lawyer Brian
Hadley all day long.

26:48.940 --> 26:50.841
Okay, we know
where Gabler is now?

26:50.876 --> 26:52.242
HPD went by his house.

26:52.277 --> 26:54.778
His car is there, but he's not,
so BOLO's out now.

26:54.813 --> 26:56.279
All right, what else
we know about him?

26:56.314 --> 26:59.850
Well, Gabler's a former
weatherman who was accused

26:59.885 --> 27:03.186
of stabbing to death
his girlfriend Heather Mayfield

27:03.221 --> 27:06.323
in his North Shore vacation home
eight years ago.

27:06.358 --> 27:07.391
Hadley represented him.

27:07.426 --> 27:09.893
Now, in the trial, the
jury deadlocked, the judge

27:09.928 --> 27:11.194
declared a mistrial.

27:11.229 --> 27:13.196
Prosecution decided
not to refile.

27:13.231 --> 27:16.266
You said
the C.O.D. was a stab wound?

27:16.301 --> 27:17.100
Yeah.

27:17.135 --> 27:18.769
They ever find
that murder weapon?

27:18.804 --> 27:20.370
No, but they had plenty
of other evidence.

27:20.405 --> 27:23.340
Huh.

27:23.375 --> 27:25.275
What?

27:25.310 --> 27:28.345
Just go with me on this
for a second, all right?

27:28.380 --> 27:30.380
What if that's what
was in the safe?

27:30.415 --> 27:31.448
You mean the knife

27:31.483 --> 27:33.717
that was used to kill Heather Mayfield?
- I do.

27:33.752 --> 27:35.285
Check it out. Rorke

27:35.320 --> 27:37.454
and his accomplice--
they go, they grab it, right?

27:37.489 --> 27:40.190
Our victim sees them, they
panic, they use the same knife

27:40.225 --> 27:41.358
to kill our vic.
- DANNY: Uh-huh.

27:41.393 --> 27:43.226
So you're saying Gabler--

27:43.261 --> 27:45.362
instead of, uh-- I don't know--
throwing the knife in the ocean

27:45.397 --> 27:46.730
or something,
he gives it to his lawyer?

27:46.765 --> 27:48.065
That's right.

27:48.100 --> 27:50.133
Yeah, I can almost hear
O.J. right now saying,

27:50.168 --> 27:51.902
"Damn. I wish I'd
have thought of that."

27:51.937 --> 27:53.403
It's a pretty wild
hunch there, boss.

27:53.438 --> 27:55.405
Yeah, maybe.
Why don't we talk to him

27:55.440 --> 27:56.740
and find out?

27:56.775 --> 27:58.175
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

27:58.210 --> 27:59.976
HADLEY:
What is this?

28:00.011 --> 28:02.212
Round three?
- STEVE: No. We're done

28:02.247 --> 28:06.216
sparring. You see, uh, despite
your best efforts to stymie us

28:06.251 --> 28:07.451
in this investigation,

28:07.486 --> 28:10.454
we figured out
who you were covering for.

28:10.489 --> 28:12.355
Edward Gabler. Right?

28:12.390 --> 28:15.158
You know what else
we figured out?

28:15.193 --> 28:17.961
We figured out
what was stolen from that safe.

28:17.996 --> 28:20.163
It was the knife
that Gabler used

28:20.198 --> 28:23.066
to kill his girlfriend,
Heather Mayfield.

28:23.101 --> 28:26.470
We know that because
we pulled her autopsy report.

28:26.505 --> 28:28.972
And our M.E. compared
her stab wound

28:29.007 --> 28:30.507
to the victim's stab wound,

28:30.542 --> 28:32.175
and confirmed
that it was the same blade.

28:32.210 --> 28:34.377
DANNY:
Oh, somehow Leo Stein

28:34.412 --> 28:36.313
figured out
that you had that knife.

28:36.348 --> 28:38.381
I don't know.
Maybe wanted some cash.

28:38.416 --> 28:40.350
Came to you.

28:40.385 --> 28:41.852
All right,
so here's the thing.

28:41.887 --> 28:43.520
Counselor, you got
one move left, and that's

28:43.555 --> 28:46.022
to cooperate, all right? We
already have you on obstruction

28:46.057 --> 28:47.824
of justice, and now possible

28:47.859 --> 28:51.428
accessory to murder, but you
already know that, right?

28:52.798 --> 28:54.097
For the record,

28:54.132 --> 28:56.333
I never thought
this would play out as it did.

28:56.368 --> 28:58.401
Right after he
killed Heather,

28:58.436 --> 29:00.303
Ed called me up in a panic.

29:00.338 --> 29:03.106
I got to his house
just before the police did.

29:03.141 --> 29:05.776
That's when he asked me
to dispose of the knife.

29:05.811 --> 29:07.444
But it was evidence,

29:07.479 --> 29:09.346
so I couldn't destroy it.

29:09.381 --> 29:12.182
But I couldn't exactly
turn it over, either.

29:12.217 --> 29:16.286
So I stuck it in our safe,
and I tried to forget about it.

29:16.321 --> 29:19.923
And for years I did...
until Leo came to see me.

29:19.958 --> 29:23.460
He said he had reason to
believe the firm had the knife.

29:23.495 --> 29:25.095
He threatened to go public.

29:25.130 --> 29:27.531
He told me
he wanted justice for Heather.

29:29.301 --> 29:31.802
It wasn't about
the money for him.

29:31.837 --> 29:36.139
He was-- I don't know--
an idealist.

29:36.174 --> 29:39.976
Ah. Oh, so you fired him just
in case he did go public.

29:40.011 --> 29:41.845
Nobody would believe him.
They'd think he was just upset

29:41.880 --> 29:43.513
'cause he got laid off.
It's good. It's smart.

29:43.548 --> 29:44.747
I'll tell you
what's gonna happen now.

29:44.783 --> 29:48.151
You're gonna tell us exactly
where we can find Edward Gabler.

29:48.186 --> 29:51.488
He's on his way
to pay the blackmail.

29:51.523 --> 29:53.323
I'm not sure where.

29:53.358 --> 29:56.593
But he has my car,
which has GPS.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.829
GROVER:
Oh, hey.

29:58.864 --> 30:01.498
Look, we got a hold
of Leo Stein's e-mails.

30:01.533 --> 30:02.833
You ain't gonna
believe this.

30:02.868 --> 30:04.501
Seems for the last
several weeks,

30:04.536 --> 30:06.970
he's been in touch with Heather
Mayfield's brother, Alan.

30:07.005 --> 30:10.473
Now Gabler has a restraining
order on Alan Mayfield.

30:10.508 --> 30:11.774
He's had it
for several years,

30:11.810 --> 30:14.211
because Mayfield threatened to kill him.
Where-where is this guy?

30:14.246 --> 30:17.347
He's on the island? Yeah, according to
travel records, he got here last week.

30:17.382 --> 30:18.582
STEVE:
So Alan Mayfield is the

30:18.617 --> 30:20.350
third player in this?
That's right.

30:20.385 --> 30:23.253
And I'll bet you this. He don't
give a damn about money.

30:23.288 --> 30:25.555
Just wants to draw Gabler out
so he can kill him.

30:25.590 --> 30:26.557
This is a revenge play.

30:54.653 --> 30:57.420
Mr. Gabler?

30:57.455 --> 30:59.222
You bring the money?

30:59.257 --> 31:01.525
It's in the backseat.

31:04.129 --> 31:06.230
Slowly.

31:20.312 --> 31:21.478
That's close enough.

31:21.513 --> 31:22.946
Let's see the cash.

31:32.057 --> 31:33.990
It's all here.

31:34.025 --> 31:36.093
Two million.

31:37.529 --> 31:39.296
So where is it?

32:00.352 --> 32:02.686
(blade clinks,
air whistling)

32:19.070 --> 32:22.172
(grunts)

32:25.310 --> 32:28.979
(gunshot)

32:29.014 --> 32:31.014
(click)

32:33.485 --> 32:35.285
Remember me?

32:35.320 --> 32:38.121
RORKE:
You were supposed

32:38.156 --> 32:40.156
to wait till
I was gone.

32:40.191 --> 32:41.491
Look, I don't want any part
of this, you understand?

32:41.526 --> 32:43.994
Then go!

32:44.029 --> 32:46.029
You got what you wanted.

32:53.304 --> 32:55.305
(engine starts and revs)

32:59.577 --> 33:02.379
Look. Don't do this.

33:02.414 --> 33:03.446
I have more money.

33:03.481 --> 33:04.748
I can pay you
whatever you want.

33:04.783 --> 33:09.753
I just gave away $2 million.

33:09.788 --> 33:12.756
You actually think
I care about money?

33:15.193 --> 33:16.393
I'm doing this for Heather.

33:16.428 --> 33:18.228
You killed my sister.

33:21.099 --> 33:22.232
Danny.

33:22.267 --> 33:23.400
That's him, it's Rorke.

33:23.435 --> 33:26.236
It looks like he's alone.

33:26.271 --> 33:27.404
All right, Chin, we're
going after Mayfield,

33:27.439 --> 33:29.239
you take Rorke.
I'm on it.

33:45.356 --> 33:47.624
(breathing hard)
Now get on your knees.

33:49.194 --> 33:51.261
Listen. I...
(grunts)

33:51.296 --> 33:53.663
Listen, p-please.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.200
I...

33:58.870 --> 34:00.070
Out of the truck.

34:01.539 --> 34:04.408
Let me see your hands.
Show me your hands!

34:16.421 --> 34:18.255
(car approaching)

34:19.891 --> 34:22.392
(siren chirping)

34:23.695 --> 34:26.129
Alan.

34:26.164 --> 34:27.397
Put the gun down, Alan.

34:27.432 --> 34:29.199
He's not worth it.

34:29.234 --> 34:31.201
DANNY: Listen, you've got
the evidence in your hand.

34:31.236 --> 34:32.535
They got to retry the case.

34:32.570 --> 34:34.404
Don't throw your life away
'cause of this guy.

34:34.439 --> 34:36.406
What life?

34:36.441 --> 34:38.241
My life is over.

34:38.276 --> 34:41.244
An innocent man was
killed this morning.

34:41.279 --> 34:43.146
And I'm an accessory.

34:43.181 --> 34:45.715
STEVE:
Alan, you're not like him.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.250
All right, you're
not like Rorke, either.

34:47.285 --> 34:48.518
You're not a killer.

34:48.553 --> 34:50.854
You put that gun down.

34:50.889 --> 34:52.722
Let us take him in.

34:52.757 --> 34:55.425
He'll be convicted this
time, you understand?

34:55.460 --> 34:57.460
Alan, you want justice
for Heather,

34:57.495 --> 35:00.630
you put the gun down right
now, let us take him in.

35:16.514 --> 35:18.515
Drop the knife,
drop the gun.

35:20.685 --> 35:23.186
You, hands behind your head,
and lock your fingers right now.

35:23.221 --> 35:25.488
Edward Gabler, you're under
arrest for the murder

35:25.523 --> 35:27.190
of Heather Mayfield.
Get up. Let's go.

35:27.225 --> 35:29.226
(siren wailing)

35:38.503 --> 35:42.472
♪ Just take me away for a while,
yeah ♪

35:42.507 --> 35:46.276

35:56.487 --> 35:57.954
GROVER:
Yeah, all right!

35:57.989 --> 35:59.622
(all cheering, clamoring)

35:59.657 --> 36:01.191
STEVE:
Yeah, buddy.

36:01.226 --> 36:03.326
All right, Flip.

36:03.361 --> 36:05.362
(applause)

36:06.931 --> 36:08.498
Very nice.

36:08.533 --> 36:09.566
Great.

36:09.601 --> 36:12.302
Hey, everyone.

36:13.504 --> 36:16.773
Friends, Hawaiians, countrymen.

36:16.808 --> 36:18.408
And women.

36:18.443 --> 36:21.778
Lend me your ears.

36:21.813 --> 36:25.481
Is he lit?
Hammered.

36:25.516 --> 36:27.617
Max. I don't know you very well.

36:27.652 --> 36:30.853
But you seem
like a good egg.

36:30.888 --> 36:32.222
And you're...

36:32.257 --> 36:34.290
you're obviously well-loved.

36:34.325 --> 36:36.859
I mean, look at
this turn out.

36:36.894 --> 36:41.297
Anyhoo,
I wanted to wish you luck.

36:41.332 --> 36:42.966
Rumor has it,

36:43.001 --> 36:45.501
you're heading
to Madagascar.

36:45.536 --> 36:49.339
Never been myself,
but hear it's lovely.

36:49.374 --> 36:52.976
So, uh, I want to wish
you safe travels.

36:53.011 --> 36:55.812
I wish you
health and happiness.

36:55.847 --> 37:01.551
A-And, uh, may the odds
be ever in your favor.

37:01.586 --> 37:04.387
Oh, and if any of you
are interested

37:04.422 --> 37:08.424
in acquiring
a Crime Clean franchise...

37:08.459 --> 37:09.726
You're done.

37:09.761 --> 37:12.262
Okay, all right, th-that's all.

37:12.297 --> 37:13.630
Oh!

37:13.665 --> 37:15.531
And l'chaim!

37:15.566 --> 37:19.569
L'chaim.
(all cheer, Grover laughs)

37:19.604 --> 37:21.771
(Grover shouting in Hawaiian)

37:21.806 --> 37:23.906
(laughter)
Speech! Speech!

37:23.941 --> 37:25.408
GROVER: Come on, Max.
Come on, Max.

37:25.443 --> 37:26.409
(all talking over each other)

37:26.444 --> 37:28.611
I haven't prepared anything.

37:28.646 --> 37:29.879
GROVER:
Come on, say a few words.

37:29.914 --> 37:32.282
Speech!
- (Kono yips)

37:32.317 --> 37:34.450
Oh.

37:34.485 --> 37:37.487
Well, um, thank you, everyone,
for coming out tonight.

37:37.522 --> 37:40.456
And a very special mahalo
to Kamekona

37:40.491 --> 37:42.358
for hosting
tonight's festivities.

37:42.393 --> 37:47.664
Also, I want to reassure
my, now, former colleagues

37:47.699 --> 37:50.066
that the M.E.'s office will be

37:50.101 --> 37:52.302
in very capable hands.

37:52.337 --> 37:53.303
Dr. Noelani Kunha

37:53.338 --> 37:56.539
is more than
up to the task.

37:56.574 --> 38:00.510
However, if you ever
need consult

38:00.545 --> 38:03.379
on open or prior investigations,

38:03.414 --> 38:06.416
of course I am available
by e-mail or text.

38:06.451 --> 38:07.717
So please contact me
at any time.

38:10.588 --> 38:15.558
So with that, uh, I just wanted
to say mahalo.

38:15.593 --> 38:19.595
It's been a honor and privilege
to be working with the HPD

38:19.630 --> 38:22.398
and the Five-0 Task Force.
Thanks, man.

38:22.433 --> 38:23.900
(applause)

38:25.570 --> 38:26.669
GROVER:
Hey!

38:26.704 --> 38:29.039
(applause, clamoring)

38:35.646 --> 38:37.480
But,

38:37.515 --> 38:40.683
what I will miss the most is...

38:40.718 --> 38:42.418
is my adopted family.

38:42.453 --> 38:46.056
And by that I mean you.

38:50.628 --> 38:51.894
Commander McGarrett.

38:51.929 --> 38:55.598
As you know, I grew up
as an only child.

38:55.633 --> 38:56.933
And I always wanted
a big brother.

38:56.968 --> 39:00.703
And when I started working
with the Five-0,

39:00.738 --> 39:02.972
I finally got one.

39:03.007 --> 39:05.709
Mahalo, Max.

39:07.645 --> 39:10.146
Detective Williams.

39:10.181 --> 39:11.380
This might be
a surprise to you,

39:11.416 --> 39:15.051
but I always considered you
as something of a role model.

39:15.086 --> 39:17.553
That does,
that does surprise me.

39:17.588 --> 39:18.654
(laughter)

39:18.689 --> 39:21.657
Surprises us all, Max,
but go on.

39:21.692 --> 39:23.793
I've always been on the
receiving end of your sarcasm,

39:23.828 --> 39:27.530
but, truth be told,
it never bothered me.

39:27.565 --> 39:30.433
I always took them as
a token of affection.

39:30.468 --> 39:32.135
I'm going to miss
your little quips.

39:32.170 --> 39:34.570
I hope that
you would consider

39:34.605 --> 39:38.074
texting me one of those
from time to time.

39:38.109 --> 39:40.610
To you, buddy.

39:42.647 --> 39:45.181
Lieutenant Kelly.

39:45.216 --> 39:48.518
Nobody understands the meaning
of<i> ohana</i> more than you.

39:48.553 --> 39:51.020
And for that reason,

39:51.055 --> 39:53.856
among many others,

39:53.891 --> 39:56.860
you are gonna make an amazing
father to little Sara.

39:58.729 --> 40:00.096
And from what
I've already seen,

40:00.131 --> 40:02.165
you already are.

40:02.200 --> 40:05.135
Mahalo, brother.

40:07.605 --> 40:08.805
Kono.

40:10.241 --> 40:13.576
Without you,

40:13.611 --> 40:16.913
I would've never married
my beautiful Sabrina.

40:16.948 --> 40:20.750
And Detective Williams is
my role model as an individual,

40:20.785 --> 40:23.653
but your loving relationship
with Adam

40:23.688 --> 40:25.588
is something that
Sabrina and I hope to emulate.

40:27.124 --> 40:28.758
Love you, Max.

40:30.061 --> 40:32.228
Sergeant Grover.

40:32.263 --> 40:33.797
I'll miss your smile.

40:35.733 --> 40:37.767
Yes, that one.
(chuckles)

40:37.802 --> 40:41.971
I know a part of you
will always belong to Chicago,

40:42.006 --> 40:44.740
but Hawaii has claimed you
as one of its sons,

40:44.775 --> 40:47.743
and I truly believe that
the islands are a better place

40:47.778 --> 40:49.712
because you are here.

40:49.747 --> 40:51.848
Oh, damn it, Max.

40:53.184 --> 40:56.686
MAX:
Jerry.

40:56.721 --> 41:00.823
Thank you for being a friend
and all your counsel.

41:00.858 --> 41:03.726
You've changed me in many ways,

41:03.761 --> 41:07.197
and allowed me to grow in ways
I never could've imagined.

41:10.701 --> 41:15.671
All of you
will be<i> ohana</i> to me.

41:15.706 --> 41:17.707
Forever.

41:20.745 --> 41:22.845
I love you.

41:22.880 --> 41:25.715
STEVE: Oh, Max. To Max!
(applause)

41:25.750 --> 41:29.752
(all cheering Max)
