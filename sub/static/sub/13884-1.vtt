01:13.927 --> 01:16.043
- Cat?
- Mmm?

01:16.207 --> 01:18.926
- You ever see "The Flintstones"?
- Sure.

01:20.087 --> 01:22.601
Do you think Wilma's sexy?

01:23.727 --> 01:25.319
Wilma Flintstone?

01:25.487 --> 01:27.955
Maybe we've been in deep space too long,

01:28.127 --> 01:31.483
but every time I see that show,
she drives me crazy.

01:31.647 --> 01:34.764
- Is it me?
- Well, I think, in all probability,

01:34.927 --> 01:38.715
Wilma Flintstone is
the most desirable woman who ever lived.

01:38.887 --> 01:41.720
That's good. I thought I was going strange.

01:41.927 --> 01:45.203
- She's incredible.
- What do you think of Betty?

01:45.367 --> 01:47.358
Betty Rubble?

01:47.927 --> 01:49.918
Well, I would go with Betty...

01:50.807 --> 01:53.002
but I'd be thinking of Wilma.

01:56.807 --> 02:01.642
This is crazy. We're talking
about going to bed with Wilma Flintstone.

02:01.807 --> 02:06.198
You're right. We're nuts.
This is an insane conversation.

02:08.007 --> 02:11.044
She'll never leave Fred, and we know it.

02:19.087 --> 02:21.157
Holly, clipboard and pen, please.

02:22.127 --> 02:26.086
- Well, Krytie, today's the day.
- But, sir, I'm just not ready.

02:26.247 --> 02:30.160
- Six weeks is just not long enough.
- Ten-thirty. Name?

02:30.367 --> 02:32.801
- You know my name.
- If this works,

02:32.967 --> 02:38.121
it's a new lease of life for us,
but we've got to do it by the book.

02:38.327 --> 02:40.761
It's just when you go into "official mode",

02:40.927 --> 02:42.918
my anxiety chip goes into overdrive.

02:43.127 --> 02:46.039
- Name?
- K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K...

02:46.207 --> 02:49.085
K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K...

02:49.247 --> 02:51.477
I'll just put Kryten.

02:52.647 --> 02:56.356
- Can you see that space vehicle?
- Where?

02:56.527 --> 02:58.518
Oh, that one. Yes, sir.

02:58.727 --> 03:01.719
And can you read the registration
for me, please?

03:01.887 --> 03:05.675
- Starbug 1?
- Right, show me to your vehicle.

03:08.807 --> 03:11.879
Right, in your own time, start the space vehicle,

03:12.047 --> 03:15.835
proceed through the cargo bay doors
and off into outer space.

03:22.647 --> 03:25.639
Once through the doors,
proceed directly to the nearest planet.

03:25.807 --> 03:28.002
Once there, bring the vehicle to a halt

03:28.167 --> 03:30.317
and then carefully reverse into the planet's orbit,

03:30.487 --> 03:35.163
remembering to pay due care
and attention to any other space users.

03:36.007 --> 03:38.237
Right, in your own time.

03:56.127 --> 03:58.118
In your own time.

03:59.167 --> 04:01.158
I've failed, haven't I?

04:01.727 --> 04:04.321
- Just proceed.
- You'll hold it against me.

04:04.487 --> 04:06.876
- One mistake.
- Please.

04:07.767 --> 04:09.758
<i>Antigrav, check.</i>

04:09.927 --> 04:13.806
<i>Retro, check. Boosters, check.</i>

04:14.207 --> 04:17.916
And very gently ease forward...

04:23.807 --> 04:26.605
I think there's something wrong
with the gearbox.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.565
The thing is, I learned to drive in Starbug 2.

04:29.727 --> 04:32.241
I'm not used to the controls in Starbug 1.

04:32.447 --> 04:36.918
- They're exactly the same.
- Yes. That's the problem.

04:42.807 --> 04:46.482
Next, transfer to autopilot,
while we conduct the recognition...

04:48.487 --> 04:51.718
- ..tests.
- Engage autopilot.

04:51.887 --> 04:54.720
Autopilot engaged. Well, I say "autopilot".

04:54.887 --> 04:57.879
It's not really.
It's Muggins here who has to do it.

04:59.247 --> 05:03.160
- Right, what's that one?
- Heavy traffic. Keep in lane.

05:04.007 --> 05:07.204
- That one?
- Danger. Space mirages ahead.

05:08.567 --> 05:12.082
At half the speed of light,
what is the stopping distance?

05:12.287 --> 05:15.359
- Four years, three months.
- And the thinking time?

05:15.567 --> 05:17.637
A fortnight.

05:18.447 --> 05:20.677
- Space phenomena. What's that?
- A pulsar.

05:20.847 --> 05:22.838
- And that?
- A binary star.

05:23.007 --> 05:25.282
- What's that?
- A time hole!

05:25.447 --> 05:27.642
- Don't help him.
- It's a time hole!

05:27.847 --> 05:30.919
- It's nothing like a time hole.
- It is.

05:31.087 --> 05:35.558
- It is! It's a time hole!
- A time hole is a rare phenomenon,

05:35.727 --> 05:39.845
which, legend has it, transports us
into another part of space and time.

05:40.007 --> 05:43.044
That is obviously a blue giant
about to go supernova.

05:43.247 --> 05:46.842
THAT is a time hole. Right, what's this?

06:07.967 --> 06:11.516
I suppose you're going to fail me for this.

06:16.167 --> 06:18.158
What is this place?

06:18.887 --> 06:21.321
Holly? Is it possible? Can this be Earth?

06:21.527 --> 06:25.236
Certainly seems that way.
Constellations match. Gravity, one G.

06:25.447 --> 06:28.883
- What's the time period?
- Well, difficult to say exactly,

06:29.047 --> 06:31.038
but according to all available data,

06:31.207 --> 06:35.723
I would estimate it's round
about lunchtime, maybe half-one.

06:36.807 --> 06:39.082
What period in history, dingleberry-breath?

06:39.927 --> 06:42.122
Can we expect to see Genghis Khan

06:42.287 --> 06:45.085
and his barbarian buddies
sweeping across the hill?

06:45.247 --> 06:50.275
Or flesh-eating dinosaurs
eating Doug McClure? What is the year?

06:50.487 --> 06:54.241
Well, I'd need more data
before I could give a precise answer.

06:54.447 --> 06:57.678
- Like?
- This year's calendar would be handy.

06:58.327 --> 07:02.400
I've never been to Earth.
I've only seen it on photographs.

07:02.567 --> 07:06.879
It's exactly like I always imagined,
only much shorter.

07:11.967 --> 07:15.004
"Nodnol, 871 selim."

07:15.807 --> 07:18.765
- Nodnol? Where's Nodnol?
- It's London.

07:18.927 --> 07:21.805
"London, 178 miles." It's backwards.

07:21.967 --> 07:25.721
- Shh! A truck.
- It'll probably hit that box.

07:30.407 --> 07:32.682
There's a perfectly rational explanation for this.

07:37.287 --> 07:39.482
Then again, possibly not.

08:10.687 --> 08:13.679
- So is this Earth?
<i>- It's Earth all right,</i>

09:00.727 --> 09:03.036
Flobba-dob blib blob bleeb.

09:12.207 --> 09:15.802
- What are you doing?
- You said look inconspicuous.

09:16.487 --> 09:19.877
- Don't be idiotic.
- But if people see my face,

09:20.047 --> 09:22.038
what will they think?

09:22.247 --> 09:27.401
Tell them you took your car
to the crushers and forgot to get out.

09:35.247 --> 09:39.604
-I got a newspaper.
- What's the year? 3991?!

09:39.807 --> 09:43.004
No, it's 1993. It's backwards.

09:43.207 --> 09:46.165
I'll switch to reverse mode.

09:46.327 --> 09:48.477
"Three brought to life in bank raid.

09:48.647 --> 09:51.798
"A masked man with
a sawn-off shotgun sucked bullets

09:51.967 --> 09:54.356
"out of two cashiers and a security guard

09:54.527 --> 09:57.121
"in a South London bank tomorrow.

09:58.727 --> 10:02.925
"The armed raider then forced
terrified staff to accept £10,000,

10:04.087 --> 10:07.045
"which he demanded
they place in the bank's vaults.

10:07.207 --> 10:10.836
"The man, Michael Ellis,
completed a 15-year prison sentence

10:11.007 --> 10:13.885
"for the crime two years ago."

10:15.967 --> 10:18.527
- What does that say?
- It's an advert.

10:18.687 --> 10:24.239
"Roll-off deodorant. Keeps you wet
and smelly for up to 24 hours."

10:25.327 --> 10:27.716
What shall we do? This place is crazy.

10:27.927 --> 10:30.566
There's nothing we can do until they find us.

10:30.727 --> 10:34.481
We'd better get a job.
What jobs are there in a backwards reality

10:34.647 --> 10:38.925
for a dead hologram and an android
with a head like a novelty condom?

10:41.527 --> 10:43.836
Here's the jobs page. This looks interesting.

10:44.607 --> 10:48.759
"Wanted - managing director, ICI.
Excellent demotion prospects.

10:48.927 --> 10:51.885
"Right candidate could go
straight to the bottom."

10:52.087 --> 10:56.205
- Something a bit more low-key.
- "Restaurant requires dish dirtier"?

10:56.367 --> 10:59.200
- Anything else?
- Ah, this looks interesting.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.801
"Theatrical agent requires novelty acts."

11:02.727 --> 11:06.402
- What do we do that's a novelty?
- In this world, everything.

11:14.967 --> 11:19.119
- Three weeks we been doing this.
- We'll do it till we find them.

11:19.327 --> 11:23.081
We ain't gonna find 'em. They're gone, buddy.

11:23.727 --> 11:26.958
But look on the bright side...they're gone, buddy!

11:28.247 --> 11:30.238
Don't you care about anyone but yourself?

11:30.447 --> 11:33.007
Hell, no. I don't even care about you.

11:33.167 --> 11:37.718
If Goalpost-Head and Freak-Face
want to get lost, that's their bag.

11:37.887 --> 11:41.084
I don't see why it should cut
into my preening time.

11:41.367 --> 11:45.918
You realise with all this,
I haven't permed my leg hairs in a week?

11:46.087 --> 11:49.124
- I'm a wreck.
- You perm your leg hairs?

11:50.007 --> 11:52.396
Only as an aid to the natural curl.

11:53.687 --> 11:57.236
- Fasten your belt.
- I don't need fashion tips from you.

11:57.447 --> 12:00.120
SAFETY belt. Look.

12:01.287 --> 12:03.403
Is that what I think it is?

12:03.567 --> 12:07.276
- What do you think it is?
- An orange whirly thing.

12:08.567 --> 12:11.559
It's a time hole.
That's where they are. We're going in.

12:11.767 --> 12:14.565
- What?! You can't go in there.
- Why not?

12:14.767 --> 12:16.917
Orange with this suit?!

12:22.087 --> 12:24.157
Where are we?

12:24.327 --> 12:28.445
I don't believe this.
According to the NaviComp, this is Earth.

12:41.127 --> 12:44.881
- What was that for?
- We don't want to freak the natives.

12:46.887 --> 12:49.685
Hey. What's the matter?

12:49.847 --> 12:53.476
I dunno.
I think me ribs are cracked. And me back.

12:53.647 --> 12:56.366
- Is my eye bruised?
- Yeah, it is.

12:57.767 --> 12:59.962
- What's that?
- It's a homing device.

13:00.167 --> 13:02.761
It'll find their flight recorder.

13:02.927 --> 13:04.918
Yonder.

13:07.327 --> 13:09.283
I'm home.

13:18.367 --> 13:21.723
- You found anything?
- The Bug's there, but they're not.

13:31.927 --> 13:34.122
You're dry.

13:34.287 --> 13:36.278
That's weird.

13:36.447 --> 13:41.077
Let's take a look around.
Maybe they left us a clue or something.

13:42.927 --> 13:45.236
What's this?

13:45.407 --> 13:48.558
They must have left them
to tell us where they'll be.

13:48.727 --> 13:52.879
- What's it say?
- It's in some weird language.

13:53.167 --> 13:57.479
"Srehtorb." That must be Polish
or Bulgarian or somethin'.

13:57.647 --> 14:02.675
- You speak Bulgarian?
- Me?! I can hardly speak English.

14:03.887 --> 14:05.684
What's this?

14:05.847 --> 14:11.604
Nodnol? Hang on!
Wait a minute! Nodnol. Nod-nol.

14:11.767 --> 14:13.997
- It's in Bulgaria.
- Are you sure?

14:14.167 --> 14:16.806
Geography was my number-one subject
at school.

14:16.967 --> 14:21.006
Nodnol - rich in animal produce
and minerals, just south of Bosnia.

14:21.207 --> 14:24.802
- What's "selim"?
- Obviously, Bulgarian for kilometres.

14:24.967 --> 14:27.276
You're so smart. I'm glad I'm with you.

14:27.447 --> 14:29.597
Well, we are the smart party.

14:32.367 --> 14:34.562
I didn't come here lookin' for trouble

14:34.727 --> 14:36.718
I just came to do the Red Dwarf shuffle!

14:36.887 --> 14:38.923
He's smart

14:39.087 --> 14:40.566
He's smart

14:40.727 --> 14:43.719
My ribs are killing me.
Let's find some transport.

14:46.207 --> 14:49.165
Come on! Let's go! Go! Come on!

14:55.327 --> 14:57.602
Bye, suckers! You lost your bike!

14:57.767 --> 15:00.486
Start pedalling, man! Start pedalling!

15:01.887 --> 15:06.199
- Get this thing in forward gear!
- It IS in forward gear!

15:16.807 --> 15:19.526
Stop! Stop!

15:24.007 --> 15:27.477
No more. I'm not moving
another yard on this thing.

15:27.647 --> 15:29.797
I've got a parting in the back of my head.

15:29.967 --> 15:32.242
It's these cheap Bulgarian bikes.

15:32.407 --> 15:35.558
You probably have to queue
for a year for this junk.

15:35.727 --> 15:39.481
You have to be a government official
to get one that goes forwards.

15:39.647 --> 15:41.683
Yo, matey. Excuse me. Excuse me.

15:43.447 --> 15:45.836
I don't speak Bulgarian. You speak English?

15:48.927 --> 15:53.478
We're lookin' for our friend. Erm...friendski.

15:53.647 --> 15:56.605
Uh... Our budski? Palski?

15:56.767 --> 15:58.758
There's an addresski hereski.

15:58.927 --> 16:01.646
Can you, erm...drop us offski?

16:05.367 --> 16:09.519
- Rock'n'roll.
-Thankski verski muchski, budski.

16:36.007 --> 16:37.998
This is the place.

16:38.167 --> 16:41.398
My eye! Me back feels
like it's been cut to ribbons!

16:41.567 --> 16:44.320
Moan, moan, moan, moan, moan!

17:01.647 --> 17:05.242
Ladies and gentlemen, olleh, olleh, olleh.

17:05.446 --> 17:07.517
Welcome to the show.

17:10.487 --> 17:13.604
- That's a joke?
- For our first trick tonight,

17:13.767 --> 17:18.715
my partner Kryten will attempt
to eat a boiled egg...

17:18.887 --> 17:20.957
forwards.

17:26.607 --> 17:30.282
This is entertainment to these people?
It's pathetic.

17:30.447 --> 17:33.166
They're Bulgarian. They have very simple tastes.

17:36.007 --> 17:39.044
I have it. It's a moron convention.

17:39.247 --> 17:42.557
Check the coat room.
If there are 20 jackets, all white,

17:42.727 --> 17:45.366
with arms that tie behind the neck, I'm right.

17:45.527 --> 17:48.405
And what better way to round off a meal

17:48.567 --> 17:51.479
than by drinking a glass of water?

17:51.647 --> 17:53.922
- Kryten.
- Whoa, stick around.

17:54.087 --> 17:56.999
They're building up to a big climax.

17:58.767 --> 18:01.361
We are the Sensational Reverse Brothers.

18:01.527 --> 18:04.325
We shall see you last night.

18:07.487 --> 18:10.957
Let's get a drink and go backstage.
Hello? Excuse me?

18:11.127 --> 18:13.641
Can I have two pints of bitter, please?

18:14.367 --> 18:17.165
- Bitter. Two pints.
- She can't understand you.

18:17.327 --> 18:20.558
- You're wasting your time.
- Yo, what you drinkin' there?

18:20.727 --> 18:22.524
Drinkski? Beerski?

18:23.687 --> 18:25.917
Ah, rettib. Two pints of rettib, please.

18:26.087 --> 18:28.157
- Rettib?
- Two.

18:28.327 --> 18:31.239
Was that difficult? No, we're the smart party.

18:31.447 --> 18:33.802
Rettib. Rettib.

19:01.887 --> 19:05.277
This isn't Bulgaria. Look at that menu. "Unem."

19:05.447 --> 19:07.881
It's English, but backwards.
Everything's backwards.

19:08.047 --> 19:10.163
- Everything's backwards?
- Yeah.

19:10.327 --> 19:11.806
Right!

19:11.967 --> 19:15.676
Well, as they say,
when in Rome, do as the Snamor do.

19:15.967 --> 19:19.277
- Up the hatch.
- Booties down.

19:28.647 --> 19:31.115
What do you mean, you don't want to leave?!

19:31.287 --> 19:33.517
- We're happy.
- We've found a niche.

19:33.687 --> 19:35.996
We're the Sensational Reverse Brothers.

19:36.167 --> 19:38.203
After just three weeks, we're a hit.

19:38.407 --> 19:41.524
- Rimmer, everything is backwards.
- We've got used to it.

19:41.687 --> 19:45.396
Once you get over the initial shock,
things actually make a lot more sense.

19:47.967 --> 19:52.165
There's no death here. You start off dead,
you have a funeral, then come to life.

19:52.327 --> 19:56.320
As each year passes, you get younger,
until you become a newborn baby.

19:56.487 --> 19:58.478
Then you go back inside your mother,

19:58.647 --> 20:00.956
who goes back inside her mother,
and so on,

20:01.127 --> 20:03.880
until eventually
we all become one glorious whole.

20:04.047 --> 20:07.323
Rimmer, you already are one glorious hole.

20:07.487 --> 20:10.479
- You've totally flipped, man.
- We want to stay.

20:10.687 --> 20:16.000
But we can't stay. Look, I'm 25 now.
In 10 years' time, I'll be 15.

20:16.167 --> 20:18.886
I'll have to go through puberty again.
Backwards.

20:19.087 --> 20:23.205
Imagine that. Your gajimbas
will suddenly rise back into your body,

20:23.367 --> 20:26.803
and next thing you know,
you're singing soprano in the choir.

20:27.007 --> 20:30.841
And worse than that,
in 25 years, I'll be a little sperm,

20:31.007 --> 20:34.443
swimming around in somebody's testicles.

20:34.607 --> 20:37.201
That's just not how I saw my future.

20:38.127 --> 20:41.915
I tell you, things are better here.
It's our universe that's backwards.

20:42.087 --> 20:44.999
Take war. War is a wonderful thing here.

20:45.167 --> 20:48.637
In 50 years' time, the Second
World War will start...backwards.

20:48.847 --> 20:51.998
- That's a good thing?
- Millions will come to life.

20:52.167 --> 20:56.683
Hitler will retreat across Europe,
liberate France and Poland,

20:56.847 --> 21:00.522
disband the Third Reich
and bog off back to Austria.

21:01.407 --> 21:03.967
We're smash hits. We'd be crazy to leave.

21:04.167 --> 21:07.603
Rimmer, we don't belong here.
This place is crazy.

21:07.807 --> 21:12.164
Crazy? Death, disease, famine -
there's none of that here.

21:12.647 --> 21:16.322
There's no crime.
Our first night here, a mugger jumped us

21:16.487 --> 21:19.240
and forced £50 into my wallet at knifepoint.

21:19.407 --> 21:23.559
OK, OK. But look at the flipside
of the coin. It's not all good.

21:23.727 --> 21:26.082
Take someone like, say, St Francis of Assisi.

21:26.247 --> 21:28.636
In this universe,
he's the petty-minded little sadist

21:28.807 --> 21:30.843
who goes around maiming small animals.

21:31.007 --> 21:33.965
Or Santa Claus - what a bastard!

21:34.167 --> 21:36.158
- Eh?
- He's the fat git

21:36.327 --> 21:40.115
who sneaks down chimneys
and steals all the kids' favourite toys.

21:47.447 --> 21:49.483
What fight? We didn't start any fight?

21:49.647 --> 21:53.196
What's he saying?

22:11.927 --> 22:15.237
- We're fired! For fighting.
- You've been with us all night.

22:15.447 --> 22:18.723
He says we'll never work the pub circuit again.

22:18.887 --> 22:21.401
For smeg's sake! Be reasonable!

22:26.447 --> 22:30.122
Tell him about the contract thing.
He can't just sack us like that.

22:34.087 --> 22:38.399
- What's that about?
- Rimmer in a fight? That's a laugh.

22:38.567 --> 22:40.876
- So, what's the plan?
- I dunno.

22:41.047 --> 22:45.279
If they don't change their minds,
head back without them. My back!

23:03.647 --> 23:07.560
We just gotta get out of here.
This universe is just too disgusting.

23:15.847 --> 23:18.884
What's the matter with him?

23:19.087 --> 23:22.079
I think we've just uneaten his pie.

23:22.287 --> 23:24.926
Unbelievable. We didn't start a fight.

23:25.127 --> 23:27.243
Look, I'm sorry, man. We were just... Ah!

23:27.407 --> 23:30.160
- Are you OK?
- My black eye's gone!

23:30.327 --> 23:33.603
He just sucked it off me face with his fist! Oh!

23:33.767 --> 23:37.157
- Now he's uncracked me ribs!
- We don't want any trouble.

23:37.327 --> 23:40.319
You don't understand.
All this mess, all this debris,

23:40.487 --> 23:44.560
is from the fight we got fired for,
which we're about to have.

23:44.767 --> 23:48.043
ABOUT to have?
I don't want a bar room brawl.

23:48.247 --> 23:52.365
It's not a bar room brawl.
It's a bar room tidy. Unrumble!

24:22.647 --> 24:26.242
- Where are you going?
- I know what happens to me back.

24:39.247 --> 24:41.841
Here, have your tooth back.

24:58.447 --> 25:01.484
Good one, gentlemen.
Thanks for your support. Let's go.

25:06.727 --> 25:08.718
I've forgotten something.

25:14.327 --> 25:18.400
What the hell? It's a good cause.

25:27.807 --> 25:30.196
How much is that, mate?

25:30.367 --> 25:31.959
Oh, aye, yeah!

25:32.127 --> 25:33.719
Oi!

25:36.807 --> 25:38.843
Tight git.

25:46.887 --> 25:51.881
You know, it could have worked.
It really could. Where's the Cat?

25:52.047 --> 25:56.359
He won't be long.
He's...you know...in the bushes.

26:01.047 --> 26:03.197
We've got to stop him.

26:18.847 --> 26:20.838
Don't ask!
