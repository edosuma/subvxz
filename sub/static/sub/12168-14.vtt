00:09.835 --> 00:12.534
So, let me ask you
something.

00:12.577 --> 00:14.884
As a scientist,
does it bother you
that most of your work,

00:14.927 --> 00:16.538
no matter how brilliant,

00:16.581 --> 00:19.062
will eventually be
considered misguided?

00:19.106 --> 00:21.543
'Cause that would
bother me.
I'm sorry?

00:21.586 --> 00:24.067

the Earth being flat,

hundreds of years.

more times
than they get it right.

Take the tomato.

00:36.601 --> 00:38.212
Excuse me?

00:38.255 --> 00:40.605
Well, after the conquest
of Mexico in 1519,

00:40.649 --> 00:42.651
tomatoes were carried
eastward to Europe,

00:42.694 --> 00:44.609
where they were believed
to be poisonous.

00:44.653 --> 00:47.612
Shouldn't you be concentrating
on what you're doing?

00:47.656 --> 00:49.223

it was shot down and repaired.

was gonna go wrong,

00:58.841 --> 01:00.973
it would have gone wrong
by now.

01:01.017 --> 01:03.585
It took the Italians,
and the Spaniards,
to realize

01:03.628 --> 01:05.587
that tomatoes are,
in fact, delicious.

01:05.630 --> 01:07.980
Good for them.

01:08.024 --> 01:10.940
Columbus was Spanish,
he figured out
the Earth was round.

01:12.550 --> 01:14.552
He was Italian.
So, I wonder what it is

01:14.596 --> 01:17.729
that makes Spaniards so good
at debunking bad science?

01:19.296 --> 01:20.906

Take this corner,

13:20.364 --> 13:23.367
take it over here,
move it over here.

13:23.411 --> 13:25.326
What's all this?

13:25.369 --> 13:27.241
This is my plan.

13:27.284 --> 13:29.983
Yeah, I figured that much.
You care to elaborate?

13:30.026 --> 13:33.290
Well, Doctors Moore and McNab
are here to study the ocean

13:33.334 --> 13:36.467
on M8R-169,
which happens to be
under a thick sheet of ice,

13:36.511 --> 13:39.340
so they brought
a 1,000-foot cable,
and a pretty powerful winch,

13:39.383 --> 13:41.733
to lower
their instruments.
Okay.

13:41.777 --> 13:43.474
And Edgar over here,
is responsible
for the magnetic grapple

13:43.518 --> 13:45.476
designed to lower the F-302s
into our Jumper bay.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.348
And you intend
to put the two together.

13:47.391 --> 13:49.437
Like chocolate
and peanut butter.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.091
Is the mechanism
really strong enough

13:51.134 --> 13:52.701
to lift a half-flooded Jumper
out of the water?

13:52.744 --> 13:55.095
Not a chance.
Well, then why are you...

13:55.138 --> 13:57.314
Because we don't have to.
We just have to get
near enough to the surface

13:57.358 --> 13:58.968
so we can get McKay
and Griffin out

13:59.012 --> 14:00.752
with a cutting team
and rescue divers.

14:00.796 --> 14:02.493

You and Rodney have been
bugging me for a chance
to try out a Jumper

14:07.324 --> 14:08.760
as a submersible,
but you sure went
a hell of a long way

14:08.804 --> 14:10.371
to make me say yes.

14:10.414 --> 14:12.329
Well, you still haven't
said it yet.

14:12.373 --> 14:14.375
I just did.

Oh, uh, how close is Zelenka
to finding them?

Why do they have to make
these things so small?

need to leave this thing

my friends where I am.
You could, uh...

Could you go for help, huh?

Could you do that?

Maybe the Jumper can swim.

16:20.066 --> 16:22.155
Okay.

16:22.198 --> 16:25.158
Cockpit is inaccessible,

16:25.201 --> 16:27.508
and most of the control
conduits run back here,

16:27.551 --> 16:33.470
so if you were really
meant to be submersible,

16:33.514 --> 16:37.474
then your drive pods should
function underwater, too, huh?

16:37.518 --> 16:39.476
Which means I could fly you
from back here.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.130
Well, not fly,
but I could surface.

16:41.174 --> 16:43.524
I mean,
if I get close to the surface,

16:43.567 --> 16:44.960
then the emergency transmitter
won't have to penetrate
so much ocean.

slowly.

16:57.712 --> 17:00.062
Show me.

17:00.106 --> 17:01.672
Well, we've started
with the likely location
of the Jumper,

17:01.716 --> 17:03.326
based on the numbers we got

17:03.370 --> 17:04.980
while triangulating
its position

17:05.024 --> 17:07.156
during its brief
radio contact with us.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.724
We then estimate
how far off-course
it has been taken, if at all,

17:09.767 --> 17:12.553
by the various currents,
slipstreams, underwater rivers

17:12.596 --> 17:15.512
that the Jumper may,
or may not, have run into.

17:15.556 --> 17:19.647
We then add its descent speed
at various rates.

17:20.604 --> 17:22.215
That's all you've got?

17:22.258 --> 17:23.868
You haven't narrowed
the search area at all.

17:23.912 --> 17:26.219
No, no. In fact,
we've increased it slightly.

17:26.262 --> 17:27.916
And how does
that count as progress?

17:27.959 --> 17:30.310
Because we're no longer
guessing.

17:30.353 --> 17:32.660
We now know
definitely that the Jumper
is somewhere in this area.

on a grapple system

to raise the Jumper.

that it is,

the fact that
you could assert...

Why else would I be here?
I don't know,

before I die.

"One last romp"? Please.

that comes to mind,
not your brains, blondie.

Now, you've got to admit,
I am a handsome man,
standing...

You're essentially
arguing with yourself.

what is?

do I tell the difference?

that any of these readings
I've been taking are correct?

is a very searchable area.

20:55.602 --> 20:57.778
You narrowed it down,

21:00.215 --> 21:02.565
It's too deep.
Your grapple's only
got 1,000 feet of cable.

21:02.609 --> 21:04.741
Yeah, we know
the Jumper should be
able to dive at least 1,000,

21:04.785 --> 21:07.962
so if he's above 2,000,
we should still be able
to get him with the grapple.

21:08.005 --> 21:09.311
And if he is deeper?

21:09.355 --> 21:09.877
He probably is.

goes to 6,000.

attacked the city,

Why can't we
do the opposite?

Turn the Jumper's cloak
into a shield?
That's right.

21:23.064 --> 21:24.761
That would hold back
the water, yes,

21:24.805 --> 21:26.415
but it would take
significantly more power.

21:26.459 --> 21:28.112
Well, we shut down
everything we don't need.

drop too low,

but provided that the, uh,
coding is correct, we surface,

they should be able to pick up

and then come pick me up.

would that kill?

for what?

underwater currents

and multiple
possible entry sites
is next to impossible,

get me out of here, huh?

Let's check it out.

35:48.363 --> 35:50.713
Why?

35:50.757 --> 35:53.629
Because
it's still swimming around
in circles in the same area,

35:53.673 --> 35:57.720
which means
it might have found
something interesting.
