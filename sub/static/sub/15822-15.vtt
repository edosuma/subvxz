00:19.344 --> 00:21.421
I just finished decorating that.

00:21.546 --> 00:23.296
Well, we have to move it.

00:23.421 --> 00:25.755
See, when people come into the room,

00:25.880 --> 00:29.010
all the good Chi strikes this thing

00:29.135 --> 00:31.716
and then bounces right back out.

00:31.841 --> 00:32.841
I see.

00:34.080 --> 00:35.693
Brenda Leigh!

00:40.582 --> 00:43.959
- I put a bow on that mirror.
- Facing the entryway?

00:44.127 --> 00:46.504
I can't officiate over a wedding
with that going on.

00:46.672 --> 00:49.941
- It's a feng shui nightmare.
- They're not getting married in japan!

00:50.066 --> 00:51.940
Actually, feng shui's from China.

00:52.065 --> 00:54.715
They're not getting married
there, either.

00:55.117 --> 00:56.263
What is that?

00:56.431 --> 00:57.431
I got it.

01:01.377 --> 01:02.539
A waterfall?

01:02.729 --> 01:06.667
We want the energy flowing for these
two lovebirds on their wedding night.

01:07.095 --> 01:10.254
Sexy. They must have a water source.

01:10.379 --> 01:13.893
I guess the Pacific Ocean
isn't big enough for that?

01:16.952 --> 01:20.501
I just... I wanted everything to be
simple. A simple ceremony here tomorrow

01:20.626 --> 01:23.760
with my parents and your sister,
a simple reception at the house...

01:23.885 --> 01:26.043
followed on Sunday by a simple
second reception

01:26.287 --> 01:29.037
in Atlanta with your entire
extended family.

01:30.131 --> 01:33.281
Honey, don't worry.
By Tuesday, we will be in Italy,

01:34.282 --> 01:35.853
far, far away.

01:36.770 --> 01:37.770
Right.

01:45.749 --> 01:48.691
- What do you think that's all about?
- Brenda...

01:49.415 --> 01:51.735
what? I'm still on duty
till tomorrow.

01:52.172 --> 01:54.238
If it's important, they'll call.

02:12.879 --> 02:14.029
Major Crimes.

02:14.342 --> 02:17.136
Will? Why are you answering
lt Provenza's phone?

02:17.570 --> 02:18.915
Why are you calling him?

02:19.040 --> 02:21.557
I thought you were at an Oceanside
hotel, rehearsing your wedding.

02:21.725 --> 02:22.725
I am.

02:22.850 --> 02:24.893
And why haven't you RSVP'd
for the reception?

02:25.730 --> 02:27.688
I already told you I was coming.

02:27.856 --> 02:31.556
Yeah, but where's the paperwork?
That's what you always ask me!

02:32.008 --> 02:34.671
Okay, so you're calling
lt Provenza to find out

02:34.796 --> 02:36.870
whether or not I RSVP
to your wedding?

02:36.995 --> 02:38.496
And why are you whispering?

02:38.621 --> 02:41.833
I'm in this fancy bathroom of this hotel
suite talking to you on the...

02:41.958 --> 02:43.364
toilet phone.

02:44.007 --> 02:47.844
I heard sirens, and I saw helicopters
flying out over Ocean Boulevard.

02:49.847 --> 02:53.729
No, they rolled out
to 773 Marina Court.

02:54.281 --> 02:55.924
- Brenda?
- Just a minute!

02:56.318 --> 02:57.318
Brenda?

03:00.305 --> 03:01.505
Bye-bye, Will.

03:05.870 --> 03:07.320
What is it, Fritzi?

03:08.339 --> 03:10.601
- What?
- I got to leave.

03:10.940 --> 03:13.212
- You what?
- The FBI just received word

03:13.337 --> 03:16.570
a big drug shipment is coming in,
and El Jefe's picking it up in person.

03:16.988 --> 03:19.623
- Honey, I got to be there.
- On the day before our wedding?

03:19.748 --> 03:22.435
Honey, I've been working on this case
for two years. You know that.

03:22.560 --> 03:25.010
I promise
I will be back home tonight.

03:25.895 --> 03:26.914
Okay.

03:27.487 --> 03:28.993
- Okay?
- Okay.

03:29.881 --> 03:30.881
Okay.

03:31.152 --> 03:32.152
Bye.

03:40.706 --> 03:42.256
Y'all need some help?

03:55.326 --> 03:58.976
Let's let your mother and Claire
finish up these arrangements.

03:59.101 --> 04:00.739
You go on home, pack,

04:00.907 --> 04:04.357
have dinner with Fritz like we planned,
and try to relax. I'll...

04:04.919 --> 04:05.919
referee.

04:07.051 --> 04:08.551
Good luck with that.

04:10.246 --> 04:11.777
No, listen, we're serious.

04:11.902 --> 04:15.542
All you need to enter the contest
is to give us your home phone number.

04:15.667 --> 04:17.690
Now, they have. We just need yours.

04:17.815 --> 04:20.091
Yeah, this is only
if we have to, you know...

04:20.216 --> 04:22.528
need to come interview you,
but you win something...

04:22.720 --> 04:25.202
- Yeah, you could win...
- Lieutenants. Lieutenants!

04:25.327 --> 04:27.278
When you guys are done
with your lap dances,

04:27.403 --> 04:30.143
- I could use a little help, please.
- No problem.

04:31.929 --> 04:33.679
Little bit of a wise ass,

04:37.494 --> 04:39.094
Flynn, it's the chief.

04:42.169 --> 04:43.219
Okay. So...

04:49.614 --> 04:51.925
- Hello?
- Chief, it's me!

04:53.305 --> 04:55.255
Yes, Lieutenant. Turn around.

04:59.164 --> 05:00.549
What are you doing here?

05:00.717 --> 05:03.946
I thought we agreed you were going
to call me with any major developments.

05:04.394 --> 05:08.216
Wanted to find out what the situation
was, before I disturbs you.

05:08.341 --> 05:10.941
It's just another
escort-service robbery.

05:13.895 --> 05:17.148
E-xcept the... manager
got himself murdered.

05:19.676 --> 05:21.953
And we've got a young girl
on the way to the hospital

05:22.078 --> 05:26.054
with a bullet in her shoulder. OK,
all right. I'll gather everybody here.

05:31.927 --> 05:34.207
Ladies... Gentlemen.

05:44.281 --> 05:46.931
Takes you back to the academy,
doesn't it?

05:48.887 --> 05:52.247
- What, I can't joke any more?
- You could if you were funny.

05:52.372 --> 05:54.563
What? I can be hilarious!

05:54.809 --> 05:57.689
But that costume
and the idea behind it

05:57.970 --> 05:59.386
is demeaning, so...

05:59.511 --> 06:02.111
maybe you don't know
what a real joke is.

06:03.331 --> 06:06.281
Well, I do know what a real joke is,

06:06.449 --> 06:08.324
Irene, and I can prove it

06:08.492 --> 06:11.286
because I dated you
for a year and a half, didn't I?

06:12.125 --> 06:14.664
- Hey, what in the hell is going on?!
- She just slapped me!

06:14.832 --> 06:18.273
And I'm putting her on report!
Insubordination, battery of an officer.

06:18.398 --> 06:21.184
She did not slap you, and nobody
is writing any reports!

06:21.309 --> 06:23.309
Now both of you, just shut up.

06:23.629 --> 06:26.308
Now, the chief just arrived,
and you understand this...

06:26.433 --> 06:29.474
we've got victims here, and they do not
include the two of you.

06:30.711 --> 06:33.441
I don't want to hear another word
about this incident that never happened.

06:33.566 --> 06:34.766
Out, out, out!

06:37.730 --> 06:40.815
Shooter entered here
around 6:30 a.m.,

06:40.983 --> 06:44.922
wearing a mask, waving a 9...
probably a Beretta just like the others.

06:45.047 --> 06:46.411
The manager was found here.

06:46.536 --> 06:49.657
Single gunshot wound to the chest.
Died en route to the hospital.

06:49.825 --> 06:53.828
And a girl who was here took one in
the shoulder, and now she's in surgery.

06:53.996 --> 06:57.407
The killer emptied the safe,
got away with around 40 grand, Chief.

06:57.532 --> 06:58.541
40 grand?

06:58.709 --> 07:01.417
Well, all the girls worked
the convention last night,

07:01.542 --> 07:04.547
and the robber struck
after the last group of ladies

07:05.078 --> 07:06.978
returned from the host hotel

07:07.216 --> 07:10.471
for the "Off-shore
Oil-drilling Expo".

07:10.596 --> 07:13.014
I swear to God,
I'm not making this up.

07:13.182 --> 07:15.250
- Who are the men outside?
- Bodyguards.

07:15.375 --> 07:17.299
They take the girls to the location,

07:17.424 --> 07:19.378
they watch out for them,
bring them back.

07:19.503 --> 07:21.189
Any crossover
from the other robberies?

07:21.357 --> 07:22.731
No, no. Not yet.

07:22.901 --> 07:25.328
Yeah, smells like
they're all inside jobs.

07:25.453 --> 07:28.363
Lt Flynn, I want the names of everyone
who works at these agencies.

07:28.488 --> 07:30.365
Maybe there's some overlap
among the employees.

07:30.533 --> 07:33.397
- Sorry, Commander, go on.
- According to the witnesses,

07:33.522 --> 07:36.819
the shooter took out the security camera
first, just like the previous robber.

07:36.944 --> 07:39.874
- Any footage recovered?
- Lt Tao's working on that.

07:41.033 --> 07:44.433
All right, so there's one bullet
for the security camera,

07:45.261 --> 07:48.586
one bullet for the manager,
one for the young lady,

07:49.215 --> 07:51.730
but I count four casings.

07:53.220 --> 07:54.764
Lieutenant Tao is where?

07:58.477 --> 08:01.088
Okay, so he misses his first
shot at the security camera.

08:01.213 --> 08:03.552
Can you roll it back
to the beginning, please?

08:03.677 --> 08:05.827
Here it is in slow motion, Chief.

08:05.952 --> 08:08.152
All right, I see three bodyguards.

08:10.973 --> 08:13.296
One, two, three, four, five women,

08:13.570 --> 08:14.742
and one manager.

08:17.493 --> 08:18.559
Stop it there!

08:18.684 --> 08:20.957
Now, why would he be
shooting at the girl?

08:21.082 --> 08:24.811
You can't tell so much by the picture,
but he's aiming at the bodygard.

08:24.936 --> 08:27.130
And the girl just caught in the way.

08:27.473 --> 08:29.715
- How many women are outside?
- Three.

08:29.883 --> 08:31.433
There should be four.

08:32.344 --> 08:35.469
Did anyone mention one
of the women leaving the scene?

08:35.594 --> 08:36.429
No.

08:37.519 --> 08:38.818
So where is she?

08:43.856 --> 08:45.356
- Chief?
- Come in.

08:45.582 --> 08:48.363
Missing girl from the crime scene?
Her name is...

08:49.278 --> 08:52.188
Name is Erica Carr,
a.k.a. "Whisper." No priors.

08:52.313 --> 08:54.268
- She's here?
- Yeah, she's...

08:54.393 --> 08:57.276
in the interview room with Julio.
She's not happy about it.

08:57.401 --> 08:59.400
I mean, I can take the statement.

08:59.525 --> 09:01.706
I mean, don't you need
to get ready for your wedding?

09:01.874 --> 09:04.004
I am ready, Lieutenant.

09:04.783 --> 09:06.133
Completely ready.

09:09.949 --> 09:11.299
Could you please?

09:20.222 --> 09:22.022
Good afternoon, Miss Carr.

09:23.567 --> 09:25.967
I'm deputy chief
Brenda Leigh Johnson.

09:26.239 --> 09:29.400
I understand that you witnessed
an incident earlier on today?

09:29.568 --> 09:31.525
Yeah. It was really horrible.

09:31.650 --> 09:33.321
But I didn't really see very much.

09:33.489 --> 09:35.889
- You fled the scene.
- I had to run.

09:36.014 --> 09:38.799
You see, I'm on hold
for a national commercial.

09:39.757 --> 09:43.261
Is that why the other ladies didn't
mention you were present at the robbery?

09:43.386 --> 09:45.913
- They were covering up for you?
- I don't know.

09:46.038 --> 09:48.187
Is everybody gonna be all right?

09:48.843 --> 09:50.629
No, your boss is dead,

09:50.797 --> 09:52.590
and one of the other ladies
just had surgery

09:52.758 --> 09:54.829
to remove a bullet
from her shoulder. So,

09:54.954 --> 09:58.854
murder, attempted murder, robbery...
these are all very bad things.

10:00.075 --> 10:02.516
Maybe I should call that number.

10:03.936 --> 10:05.036
What number?

10:05.560 --> 10:09.023
The agencies give us a number to call
in an emergency.

10:09.355 --> 10:11.734
The agencies?
You work at more than one?

10:15.864 --> 10:17.513
I didn't want to tell you that.

10:17.638 --> 10:20.023
Damn it, I am just
making this all worse.

10:20.148 --> 10:22.398
A lot of girls work
for more than one place.

10:22.523 --> 10:25.773
And all the agencies give you
the same number to call?

10:28.051 --> 10:32.046
Well, I hate to break it to you,
whisper, but this is an emergency.

10:32.828 --> 10:33.881
O... kay.

10:37.981 --> 10:39.845
His name is Evan Young.

10:40.013 --> 10:41.363
He's an attorney.

10:45.485 --> 10:47.585
I don't know what to say to him.

10:48.262 --> 10:50.012
<i>Smith, Brewer, and Young.</i>

10:51.187 --> 10:52.006
<i>Hello?</i>

10:52.131 --> 10:55.670
Yes, Evan Young, please.
It's detective Sanchez, L.A.P.D.

10:55.881 --> 10:57.167
I'm here with his client.

10:57.292 --> 11:00.892
- Sure, one moment, please.
- Thank you. They're getting him.

11:01.302 --> 11:03.744
Could you just explain
everything to him?

11:05.223 --> 11:07.923
You want us to talk
to your lawyer for you?

11:09.660 --> 11:10.960
All right, then.

11:11.294 --> 11:12.894
- Evan Young.
- Yeah.

11:13.739 --> 11:17.689
I'm here with an employee of some
escort agency that you represent.

11:17.968 --> 11:20.489
She witnessed a robbery/homicide
this morning

11:20.614 --> 11:22.725
at the top to bottom escort service.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.723
- I'll be right down.
- He's on his way.

11:24.891 --> 11:26.753
- You're at Parker Center?
- Yeah.

11:26.878 --> 11:29.436
- Tell her I'll be right there.
- All right, thank you.

11:30.133 --> 11:32.616
Oh, let me just ask
one little question.

11:32.985 --> 11:36.471
Mr. Young? I'm deputy chief
Brenda Leigh Johnson.

11:36.596 --> 11:38.710
Would it be all right
if we asked your client

11:38.835 --> 11:41.485
a few questions
while you're getting here?

11:41.610 --> 11:43.110
Wonderful. Bye, now.

11:43.996 --> 11:46.905
Your lawyer said that while
we're waiting, you're free to discuss

11:47.030 --> 11:50.730
everything that happened before,
during, and after the robbery.

11:51.718 --> 11:52.929
I am?

11:55.957 --> 11:58.103
So, I can tell you guys
about the drugs?

11:58.228 --> 11:59.032
Yeah.

11:59.157 --> 12:02.734
Lawyers, they like to get all the drug
talk out of the way early.

12:02.915 --> 12:03.915
Okay.

12:04.645 --> 12:05.645
Well,

12:06.099 --> 12:08.638
I was trying to help
the girl who got shot,

12:08.763 --> 12:09.977
Kitty... Kelli...

12:10.785 --> 12:13.655
and she was really worried
about all the drugs in her purse.

12:13.780 --> 12:15.816
- What kind of drugs?
- Cocaine.

12:16.795 --> 12:18.235
It's for the clients.

12:18.649 --> 12:22.265
And then Tony had all the other girls
give me all of their drugs, too.

12:22.390 --> 12:24.368
Tony... is your bodyguard?

12:24.751 --> 12:27.161
Yeah. And he told me to run.

12:27.475 --> 12:30.564
And... I had all these drugs on me,
and it didn't seem like

12:30.689 --> 12:33.375
we were gonna get paid
because of the whole robbery thing.

12:33.543 --> 12:36.022
Do you usually get paid
the night you work?

12:36.801 --> 12:37.629
Yeah.

12:37.797 --> 12:40.513
We get a percentage of the cash
that we bring in at the door,

12:40.638 --> 12:44.488
and then we get to keep all of the tips
we get for other services.

12:45.771 --> 12:47.222
Like... private time.

12:49.539 --> 12:51.476
Do all the agencies
pay you the same way?

12:51.772 --> 12:54.298
- Yeah, we fill out a form.
- That's enough for now.

12:54.423 --> 12:56.166
Thank you so much for all your help.

12:56.291 --> 12:58.941
You can just, wait here
for your attorney.

12:59.642 --> 13:00.642
Bye.

13:02.049 --> 13:04.058
20 years old. "I need you."

13:04.183 --> 13:06.195
Lt Flynn, employment records?

13:07.335 --> 13:08.685
This is not fair.

13:09.972 --> 13:10.972
Pardon me?

13:11.831 --> 13:14.207
- This just is not fair.
- Lieutenant...

13:15.335 --> 13:16.385
Hey, Chief.

13:17.909 --> 13:21.221
So I was just looking at girl...
looking for gir... women

13:21.563 --> 13:23.687
who work at more than one
stripper agency,

13:23.812 --> 13:25.719
and since they all use fake names,

13:26.685 --> 13:29.306
I thought by examining
their photos, I might...

13:30.058 --> 13:32.392
I was hoping
for social-security numbers.

13:32.560 --> 13:36.021
From what I can gather, all the women
work as independent contractors.

13:36.189 --> 13:38.203
I never had a contractor
who looked like this.

13:38.328 --> 13:40.566
Though this one does
have a tool belt.

13:40.691 --> 13:42.791
Thank you gentlemen.
Thank you.

13:43.055 --> 13:44.446
Sergeant, thank you.

13:45.573 --> 13:47.910
I tried 2 judges. Neither thought
we had enough evidence

13:48.035 --> 13:50.914
to authorize a warrant for any
of the agencies' employment records.

13:51.039 --> 13:54.188
I have corporate tax filings from
all the companies that were robbed,

13:54.313 --> 13:56.955
but that doesn't tell us much
about who worked for them.

13:57.436 --> 14:00.636
Maybe we can get these employment
records on our own.

14:00.761 --> 14:04.174
Lt Flynn, why don't you give your eyes
a rest from all this research

14:04.342 --> 14:07.761
and call and see how the young lady who
was wounded in today's attack is doing?

14:07.995 --> 14:09.045
Yes, Chief.

14:09.170 --> 14:10.170
Thank you.

14:14.695 --> 14:17.795
All righty, she's gone.
Give me the pictures back.

14:19.362 --> 14:22.041
See how judgmental she is?
Like we got to go through her to get...

14:22.166 --> 14:24.599
- Like you're the picture police.
- You know what I see?

14:24.724 --> 14:26.550
You know what I see?
I see two people

14:26.675 --> 14:30.391
who make it impossible for this division
to function as a team,

14:30.856 --> 14:33.188
and it's enough. It's enough!

14:34.968 --> 14:37.414
Now, the chief is getting
married tomorrow,

14:37.539 --> 14:40.532
and she's gonna be gone for about
two weeks on her honeymoon.

14:40.657 --> 14:44.264
Pope wants to promote
somebody from our squad to C.I.,

14:44.389 --> 14:47.676
and clearly, that promotion
needs to go to one of you.

14:47.991 --> 14:50.303
So, while the chief is gone,

14:50.471 --> 14:52.971
you or you...
and I don't care which...

14:53.629 --> 14:56.062
applies for that transfer.

14:56.593 --> 14:58.478
Do you understand what I'm saying?

14:58.646 --> 15:00.296
Do I make myself clear?

15:02.271 --> 15:03.271
Do i?!

15:08.067 --> 15:09.322
I said,

15:09.490 --> 15:10.490
"Do you

15:10.700 --> 15:12.234
understand me?!"

15:13.838 --> 15:14.703
I do.

15:15.496 --> 15:16.496
Yes, sir.

15:24.255 --> 15:26.297
Flynn, the victim? Hospital?

15:26.769 --> 15:27.769
Yes, sir.

15:33.719 --> 15:34.556
Hello.

15:34.724 --> 15:36.107
I hate to bother you.

15:36.232 --> 15:38.305
Shouldn't you be in a 5-star
hotel by the beach?

15:38.430 --> 15:41.426
I left my parents at the hotel
with Fritz's sister.

15:41.551 --> 15:44.232
- They're decorating for the ceremony.
- Together?

15:44.639 --> 15:47.735
Yeah. Claire's officiating. My parents
are a little upset about that.

15:47.903 --> 15:50.071
Right. Well, you can't
hide here forever.

15:50.239 --> 15:52.240
I'm not hiding. I'm doing my job.

15:52.408 --> 15:55.156
- And I could really use your help.
- With what?

15:55.281 --> 15:58.871
I have a lawyer coming by, who
represents all these escort agencies.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.076
He probably knows
that I don't have the power

16:01.201 --> 16:03.648
to hand this case over
to the feds, but you could.

16:03.773 --> 16:06.546
- Why would I hand this...
- just go along with me on this, please!

16:06.714 --> 16:09.964
I could really use your help...
and a visitor's badge.

16:10.362 --> 16:11.551
- All right.
- Thanks.

16:12.740 --> 16:15.308
And then it suddenly occurred
to us, Mr. Young,

16:15.433 --> 16:18.933
that if Erica got your number
from three separate agencies,

16:19.058 --> 16:21.458
you might be working
for even more than that.

16:21.583 --> 16:22.631
8, altogether.

16:22.756 --> 16:26.388
These businesses require specialized
civil and criminal skills

16:26.513 --> 16:29.185
in order to stay in operation.
That's my practice.

16:29.310 --> 16:32.071
And you monitor things
like earnings and payroll?

16:32.239 --> 16:33.489
Of course. Why?

16:33.805 --> 16:37.048
Well, because whoever is
behind these robberies

16:37.173 --> 16:40.865
seems to have advance knowledge
of when each individual agency

16:40.990 --> 16:43.961
will be receiving
a large influx of cash.

16:44.086 --> 16:47.286
If we could look at your
client's employee records...

16:48.203 --> 16:51.602
- That's not gonna happen. No.
- Mr. Young, right now...

16:51.727 --> 16:55.723
you are the only person we can connect
to every place that's been robbed.

16:56.079 --> 16:57.079
Nice try.

16:57.204 --> 17:01.019
Come on, giving you information in order
to avoid being investigated myself

17:01.144 --> 17:04.119
would be an ethical violation
of the first magnitude.

17:04.244 --> 17:06.939
You want employee records?
Try a warrant.

17:08.686 --> 17:10.686
I actually have a better idea.

17:10.988 --> 17:14.321
Why don't we discuss it
with special investigator

17:14.490 --> 17:16.854
Brenda Johnson of the I.R.S.?

17:18.521 --> 17:20.117
Ms. Johnson, this is Mr. Young.

17:20.287 --> 17:23.061
He also has an interest
in the string of robberies

17:23.186 --> 17:25.237
that I've asked you to examine.

17:25.865 --> 17:28.415
- Very nice to meet you, sir.
- And you.

17:29.513 --> 17:32.430
Chief Pope asked that I quantify
the amount of cash

17:32.555 --> 17:34.613
stolen from several
unidentified businesses,

17:34.738 --> 17:37.238
as a proportion
of their yearly income,

17:37.363 --> 17:40.020
and I found some
glaring discrepancies.

17:40.799 --> 17:41.949
Of what sort?

17:42.074 --> 17:44.801
Well, it seems that each
business lost, in one night,

17:44.926 --> 17:47.563
up to 10% of their yearly gross,

17:47.943 --> 17:50.650
indicating a vast under-reporting
of revenue.

17:51.053 --> 17:52.378
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

17:52.503 --> 17:56.063
In fact, if chief Pope were to
identify these businesses to us

17:56.188 --> 17:59.075
by name and federal I.D. Number,

17:59.243 --> 18:01.668
the Treasury Department
would immediately initiate

18:01.793 --> 18:04.691
a 452.1c investigation
into all of them.

18:06.482 --> 18:08.499
452.1c?

18:08.624 --> 18:10.670
I'm not quite sure what that is.

18:11.512 --> 18:13.991
Well, it's complicated, but...

18:14.278 --> 18:16.771
just to audit the last
five years of tax returns

18:16.896 --> 18:18.946
would take at least two years.

18:19.977 --> 18:22.166
- Two years?
- But if chief Pope

18:22.291 --> 18:24.991
were to send it our way,
we'd be up for it.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.972
Anything else you'd like to know?

18:33.741 --> 18:35.841
Do you have a flash drive handy?

18:41.228 --> 18:42.881
- Coast clear?
- All set.

18:43.006 --> 18:46.455
Lawyer grabbed whisper, ran out of here
like somebody was chasing him.

18:46.580 --> 18:49.856
Now, Chief, take a look at the screen.
We found something.

18:49.981 --> 18:50.981
"We"?

18:53.836 --> 18:56.215
So I cross-checked
every every employee

18:56.383 --> 18:58.529
from the eight companies Young
works for... bodyguards,

18:58.654 --> 19:00.904
escorts, managers, even temp staff.

19:01.173 --> 19:03.715
Besides Young, only one
social-security number

19:03.840 --> 19:06.225
connects to all the companies
that were robbed.

19:06.393 --> 19:07.393
Thanks.

19:08.042 --> 19:09.042
You okay?

19:09.682 --> 19:11.516
Yeah. I'm... fine. I'm just...

19:11.641 --> 19:13.941
my eyes are tired from squinting
at the screen.

19:14.109 --> 19:15.109
Okay.

19:17.237 --> 19:18.675
One number, 4 different names.

19:18.864 --> 19:21.464
Terry Paswell, Tesha Dawn,
Cassie Bell...

19:22.029 --> 19:23.179
Kelli Malone.

19:23.702 --> 19:26.352
Kelli as in
"she gave me her drugs" Kelli?

19:26.477 --> 19:28.581
Kelli, the girl in the hospital?
The one who got shot?

19:28.749 --> 19:31.399
Yes. At least I'll know
where to find her.

19:31.705 --> 19:32.905
Thank you.

19:36.697 --> 19:38.847
When Mickael, our boss went down.

19:39.617 --> 19:40.967
Blood everywhere.

19:41.998 --> 19:44.408
And I felt this, like, whoosh.

19:45.827 --> 19:48.070
I felt like someone
shoved me really hard.

19:48.195 --> 19:49.939
A bullet will do that to you.

19:50.064 --> 19:53.064
My husband, Vince,
thinks that I work at a diner.

19:54.366 --> 19:56.866
And I usually do...
on Thursday nights.

19:58.509 --> 20:01.009
If he finds out
what really happened...

20:03.015 --> 20:05.743
- Do you have to tell him?
- Wait. Your husband doesn't...

20:06.327 --> 20:08.580
He doesn't know
that you're a stripper?

20:08.705 --> 20:12.308
Is it safe to assume that he doesn't
know about your other aliases, either?

20:12.433 --> 20:14.174
- My what?
- All the names you use

20:14.299 --> 20:16.749
at all the other agencies
you work for...

20:16.874 --> 20:20.049
- Tesha, Terry, Dawn.
- A lot of girls do that.

20:20.540 --> 20:22.176
It's part of my job to...

20:22.505 --> 20:25.105
create a false impression
for these guys.

20:25.831 --> 20:27.931
Clients can get over-interested.

20:29.288 --> 20:31.588
Look, Vince is an Iraqi war veteran.

20:32.008 --> 20:34.688
He's had a lot of problems
since he came back.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.551
He's lost three jobs.

20:37.529 --> 20:40.479
I don't have skills
to support us any other way.

20:41.613 --> 20:44.694
Then why don't you cooperate with us,
and we'll see what we can do?

20:44.819 --> 20:46.195
Cooperate how?

20:46.320 --> 20:49.286
Well, you're employed at
every agency that's been robbed.

20:49.454 --> 20:51.663
Does anyone else know
where or when you work?

20:51.788 --> 20:53.188
No. I tell no one.

20:53.689 --> 20:55.944
Did you recognize anything
about the shooter?

20:56.069 --> 20:58.339
Anything... his eyes, his voice?

20:58.640 --> 20:59.790
I don't know.

21:00.903 --> 21:02.153
He wore a mask.

21:03.509 --> 21:05.075
It happened really fast.

21:05.200 --> 21:07.385
What about all those drugs
you were carrying?

21:07.510 --> 21:08.960
You remember those?

21:09.298 --> 21:12.948
- How much cocaine are we talking about?
- Look, I don't deal.

21:13.073 --> 21:14.962
I just give it away for free.

21:15.087 --> 21:19.089
Last night, the customers were snorting
it up their noses with $100 bills.

21:19.552 --> 21:23.152
Okay, after a few hits, they put
those $100 bills in my bra.

21:23.788 --> 21:24.788
Look...

21:25.687 --> 21:28.637
I'm a little older than
most of the other girls.

21:29.233 --> 21:32.733
Nothing makes me look prettier
than a few lines of cocaine.

21:34.514 --> 21:37.264
I don't know anything
about these robberies.

21:37.519 --> 21:39.819
I'm just trying to help my husband.

21:41.047 --> 21:42.633
And now I'm ruined.

21:51.968 --> 21:55.185
- That is one sad story.
- Don't tell me you fell for that.

21:55.310 --> 21:57.580
Her husband loses his job,
and her only option

21:57.705 --> 22:00.440
is to hand out cocaine to strangers
while taking her clothes off?

22:00.608 --> 22:03.067
- Please. I don't buy it for a second.
- Wait, wait.

22:03.344 --> 22:05.946
But if Kelli's lying, then Vince
probably knows she's stripping.

22:06.256 --> 22:07.520
Of course he did.

22:07.817 --> 22:09.395
And he's an Iraqi war veteran.

22:09.520 --> 22:12.311
What kind of handgun
are they using over there now, sergeant?

22:12.436 --> 22:14.698
Beretta m9, same type of weapon
used in the robberies.

22:14.823 --> 22:15.839
Exactly.

22:16.114 --> 22:18.625
We need to get a search warrant
for the malone residence.

22:18.944 --> 22:20.229
Whoa, on what grounds?

22:20.354 --> 22:22.869
We don't have any physical evidence
connecting them to the robberies.

22:22.994 --> 22:26.307
Forget the robberies. She just admitted
to handing out cocaine to clients.

22:26.432 --> 22:29.473
For all we know, she's hoarding
kilos of it under her bed.

22:30.462 --> 22:32.022
I have to get home for dinner.

22:32.388 --> 22:35.600
Have lieutenant provenza contact me
after you've served the search warrant.

22:36.067 --> 22:39.005
Maybe y'all can wrap this up
before I finish dessert.

22:39.814 --> 22:41.103
You got it, chief.

22:43.467 --> 22:44.492
Hi, it's me.

22:44.617 --> 22:45.617
<i>Hey.</i>

22:46.270 --> 22:48.197
What are you doing on the table?

22:48.500 --> 22:50.996
- What are you doing?
<i>- What am I doing...</i>

22:51.271 --> 22:52.907
- What?
- Nothing.

22:53.536 --> 22:54.668
<i>What's up?</i>

22:54.793 --> 22:56.163
Your mother and Claire

22:56.331 --> 22:58.966
<i>have apparently agreed on what
the hotel suite should look like.</i>

22:59.903 --> 23:01.362
My poor father.

23:02.705 --> 23:04.124
Where are you?

23:05.300 --> 23:07.007
We haven't made the arrest yet.

23:09.863 --> 23:11.427
You're not coming home?

23:12.831 --> 23:14.099
Honey, I can't.

23:15.259 --> 23:17.017
I... I am so sorry.

23:17.185 --> 23:21.062
<i>Look, I would've called you earlier,
but I kept hoping we'd be done.</i>

23:21.723 --> 23:23.523
We're probably gonna be here
all night.

23:26.447 --> 23:28.650
You're upset.
I can tell you're upset.

23:29.707 --> 23:32.113
Just remember this the next time

23:32.238 --> 23:34.701
you're mad at me 'cause
I have to put my work first.

23:34.902 --> 23:35.906
I will.

23:36.031 --> 23:37.281
I will.
Honey,

23:37.766 --> 23:39.789
I am so sorry.

23:40.454 --> 23:42.499
You didn't plan it this way, I know.

23:42.624 --> 23:45.295
Just make it to our little ceremony
tomorrow, and I'll be fine.

23:45.463 --> 23:46.463
I will.

23:47.056 --> 23:48.673
Hon, listen, I got to go.

23:48.841 --> 23:50.668
OK, take care of yourself.

23:53.341 --> 23:56.234
Vince malone, I've got a warrant
to search your house, sir. Step aside.

23:56.359 --> 23:59.002
- What are you doing here?
- Want to tell us where the drugs are?

23:59.127 --> 24:01.269
Nice tv, man. You like games, too?

24:02.762 --> 24:05.065
So much for the couple
struggling to get by.

24:10.926 --> 24:11.926
Here.

24:26.539 --> 24:28.010
Looks like a gram of coke.

24:28.135 --> 24:30.423
All right, okay, you found my drugs,
so arrest me.

24:30.840 --> 24:32.190
What's the hurry?

24:39.089 --> 24:41.742
- There's something back here.
- All right, let's move it.

24:42.768 --> 24:43.868
There we go.

24:45.676 --> 24:47.070
Fresh drywall.

25:02.149 --> 25:03.665
Check it out, chief.

25:03.967 --> 25:05.945
The dog can smell money?

25:06.376 --> 25:08.461
$100 bills used to snort cocaine.

25:08.756 --> 25:11.464
Vince malone, you are under arrest.
Put your hands behind your back.

25:11.632 --> 25:13.163
You have the right to remain silent.

25:13.288 --> 25:15.766
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

25:15.891 --> 25:18.286
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford one,

25:18.411 --> 25:20.472
it will be appointed by the state.
Have you heard

25:20.597 --> 25:23.306
- and understood these rights, sir?
- Yes, sir, I do.

25:23.728 --> 25:25.372
So, tell me, Vince,

25:25.973 --> 25:27.479
on this cash you have here,

25:27.604 --> 25:30.351
is this your wife's blood, or is it from
the man you murdered this morning?

25:30.476 --> 25:31.693
No, I cut myself.

25:32.361 --> 25:33.624
Really? Where?

25:35.902 --> 25:38.491
It was a long time ago.
When I was hiding...

25:38.659 --> 25:41.655
I can type this blood so fast
it'll make your head spin.

25:42.773 --> 25:44.942
All right, look,
you have to understand something.

25:45.067 --> 25:48.293
I never meant to shoot anyone,
but that guy was coming at me, and...

25:49.353 --> 25:51.446
I would never hurt Kelli. All right?

25:51.571 --> 25:53.339
Kelli has nothing to do with this.

25:53.507 --> 25:56.926
You just happen to rob escort agencies
only on the nights that your wife works?

26:03.601 --> 26:06.519
Chief, we're gonna need
more evidence bags.

26:07.438 --> 26:09.917
I refuse to believe
his wife's not behind all this.

26:10.042 --> 26:12.734
He's not smart enough
to plan these robberies on his own.

26:13.257 --> 26:15.486
We'll get the wife, chief.
She was at the last robbery,

26:15.815 --> 26:17.905
and she lives in a house
insulated with cash.

26:18.387 --> 26:20.327
He doesn't have
to testify against her.

26:20.452 --> 26:22.076
Spousal privilege.

26:23.066 --> 26:24.502
She's not gonna get away, chief.

26:24.627 --> 26:26.755
We'll get around
the spousal-rights problem.

26:26.880 --> 26:29.709
- We'll turn the guy around.
- And I'll tell you how...

26:30.003 --> 26:32.295
When you call me
on your way back from italy.

26:35.413 --> 26:38.134
Don't give him his phone call
until you absolutely have to.

26:38.259 --> 26:41.038
And don't let him talk to his wife
until after he's arraigned.

26:51.318 --> 26:54.093
Fritz will be here
any minute, I'm sure.

26:54.218 --> 26:57.547
Oh, mama, I'm not worried
about Fritzi not showing up.

26:58.106 --> 27:01.263
It takes a while to get someone like
El Jefe completely through booking.

27:01.388 --> 27:03.772
It's not like
the minister's going anywhere.

27:03.988 --> 27:06.542
Are you sure, sure, sure

27:06.884 --> 27:09.832
Claire is legally qualified
to marry people?

27:10.000 --> 27:12.016
Oh, yes, mama, yes.

27:13.361 --> 27:15.810
Besides, I did a background
check on her.

27:18.196 --> 27:19.322
Fritz is here!

27:19.447 --> 27:21.349
He's getting dressed right now.

27:21.474 --> 27:24.096
I told them to start the music
because the photographer's

27:24.264 --> 27:27.293
only got 30 minutes, and if we're not
out of this place at 3:00 p.m.,

27:27.418 --> 27:29.549
it's gonna cost me
another million dollars.

27:29.996 --> 27:32.688
Not that I'd begrudge
one penny of it to see you

27:32.856 --> 27:34.975
looking so beautiful and happy.

27:35.718 --> 27:37.693
You are happy, right?

27:38.702 --> 27:40.721
Oh, daddy, of course I am.

27:40.921 --> 27:42.545
Now, don't make me cry.

27:42.670 --> 27:44.532
It took me an hour
to put on this makeup.

27:44.657 --> 27:46.535
Well, when you're ready, then.

27:49.493 --> 27:50.873
Take your time, dear.

27:51.752 --> 27:54.210
You waited too long
to rush through this.

28:19.485 --> 28:20.987
Dearly beloved,

28:21.112 --> 28:22.806
we are gathered here today

28:22.931 --> 28:24.830
in sight of the boundless sea,

28:24.955 --> 28:26.242
mother of all life,

28:26.591 --> 28:29.637
to join two loving people
in matrimony.

28:30.501 --> 28:33.713
Brenda, Fritz never gives up
on the people he loves.

28:34.396 --> 28:35.369
Fritz,

28:35.494 --> 28:37.508
I know
I don't need to tell you this,

28:37.633 --> 28:39.964
but brenda never gives up
on anything.

28:40.342 --> 28:42.091
This is why you two,

28:42.600 --> 28:43.592
y'all,

28:44.219 --> 28:46.172
make the perfect match.

28:51.447 --> 28:52.810
Okay, let's do this.

29:01.569 --> 29:03.589
Now just the howard family.

29:04.608 --> 29:05.976
No, no. That includes you.

29:06.627 --> 29:08.159
Honey, you're one of us now.

29:11.951 --> 29:14.273
How much time before the reception?

29:14.819 --> 29:16.292
About three hours. Why?

29:17.556 --> 29:19.294
Now just the two of you.

29:21.346 --> 29:22.645
I ran out of there

29:22.770 --> 29:25.301
before we finished processing El Jefe.
I just have to go back,

29:25.510 --> 29:27.384
put my signature
on his arrest papers.

29:27.509 --> 29:28.678
You're kidding!

29:30.939 --> 29:33.475
It's lousy timing. I know that.
I'm really, I'm sorry.

29:33.685 --> 29:36.645
Well, if it weren't for these pictures,
I could care less.

29:39.416 --> 29:41.953
If you two are in a rush, I could
just take a couple more shots here,

29:42.078 --> 29:43.989
and then I could rearrange you
any way you like.

29:44.114 --> 29:46.905
That's a great idea, son.
We got to get out of here lickety-split.

29:47.073 --> 29:48.363
What can we do to help?

29:48.488 --> 29:49.867
Rearrange us how?

29:50.035 --> 29:51.942
Now watch this. I'll add you in.

29:52.067 --> 29:53.537
Cut, paste...

29:53.862 --> 29:56.661
And look.
Group shot of all of you at the railing.

30:01.662 --> 30:04.161
Hello, sergeant David Gabriel,
major crimes.

30:04.810 --> 30:05.810
What?

30:06.529 --> 30:08.677
Chief, didn't you just get married?

30:09.151 --> 30:11.200
No, no, Provenza and Flynn,

30:11.325 --> 30:14.064
they went at him most of the night,
but he's sticking by that story.

30:14.189 --> 30:16.769
But Kelli still doesn't know
we have her husband under arrest, so...

30:17.140 --> 30:19.646
- Did she get married or not?
- She got married.

30:23.122 --> 30:25.482
Yeah, he's still here.
You want to speak to him?

30:25.707 --> 30:26.767
Sure. Hold on.

30:26.892 --> 30:27.892
Buzz.

30:28.308 --> 30:29.360
Phone.

30:30.697 --> 30:31.827
Here he comes.

30:33.615 --> 30:34.703
Yes, chief?

30:36.331 --> 30:37.263
Okay.

30:37.388 --> 30:39.793
Well, I can make the video
look that way.

30:40.651 --> 30:42.237
How soon do you need it?

31:07.958 --> 31:09.393
The wife's mirandized.

31:09.518 --> 31:12.824
I told her we do that to everyone when
we take their statement more than once.

31:13.107 --> 31:15.627
I told her that the video,
standard procedure.

31:15.752 --> 31:17.788
And she's shocked,
shocked to hear her husband

31:17.956 --> 31:20.191
was involved
in these horrible crimes.

31:20.925 --> 31:23.145
I'm gonna give buzz a signal when

31:23.270 --> 31:26.057
I want lieutenant Tao to play the audio
in the waiting room.

31:26.182 --> 31:27.259
Thanks.

31:32.451 --> 31:34.675
Lieutenant Tao,
would you please set up a laptop

31:34.800 --> 31:37.120
so Mr. Malone can observe
the interview?

31:37.245 --> 31:40.818
Chief, we... we own the waiting area
and the hallways for another half-hour.

31:40.943 --> 31:43.174
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Mr. Malone.

31:43.842 --> 31:45.913
I'm making vows today, so listen up.

31:46.038 --> 31:48.140
If I hear one more word
come out of your mouth,

31:48.265 --> 31:50.157
you have my solemn word
you will never see

31:50.282 --> 31:52.447
Kelli again
for the rest of your life.

31:52.615 --> 31:54.365
Nod if you understand me.

31:57.546 --> 31:59.356
Hospital wi-fi is good, chief.

31:59.992 --> 32:00.831
Thank you.

32:01.813 --> 32:03.458
I'll have audio for you in a sec.

32:07.509 --> 32:08.797
Good afternoon, Kelli.

32:10.590 --> 32:14.153
We're so sorry to put this extra burden
of your husband's guilt on you,

32:14.278 --> 32:17.089
especially right now, but we thought
you should know the truth.

32:17.214 --> 32:18.640
Vince didn't do these things.

32:19.805 --> 32:21.515
I know how hard it is to accept

32:21.640 --> 32:23.683
that the person
you love the most might be

32:23.808 --> 32:26.078
hiding things from you,
but remember...

32:26.530 --> 32:28.567
You tried to hide
being an escort from him,

32:28.735 --> 32:30.620
so anything's possible, right?

32:30.829 --> 32:33.363
We, we found all the money
from the robberies hidden

32:33.531 --> 32:34.990
behind a wall in your house.

32:35.712 --> 32:36.616
Sorry.

32:39.329 --> 32:41.346
What if the money wasn't stolen?

32:43.834 --> 32:47.077
We found your boss's blood
on some of the cash we retrieved.

32:47.670 --> 32:49.337
And I'm afraid that's not all.

32:49.505 --> 32:50.531
Buzz.

32:59.220 --> 33:02.387
This is the security footage
that we got from the robbery.

33:02.852 --> 33:05.854
We've had a chance to study it,
and you might want to brace yourself.

33:06.022 --> 33:07.757
It's pretty shocking.

33:13.214 --> 33:15.071
Could you play that again, Buzz?

33:16.362 --> 33:18.623
You said you didn't remember
how many shots were fired,

33:18.748 --> 33:21.161
but what you also
might not remember is that Vince

33:21.329 --> 33:23.079
intentionally pointed the gun at you

33:24.140 --> 33:25.659
and pulled the trigger.

33:27.853 --> 33:28.903
He shot me.

33:32.042 --> 33:33.048
On purpose?

33:35.032 --> 33:36.851
I'm afraid it gets worse.

33:37.299 --> 33:39.646
When we confronted Vince
with this video,

33:39.941 --> 33:41.655
he said that you planned
the whole thing.

33:41.780 --> 33:43.057
That's a lie.

33:43.182 --> 33:45.391
I don't know what's up
with the sound.

33:48.497 --> 33:51.232
You know what Vince was doing
when you sent him home for toothpaste?

33:51.599 --> 33:52.400
What?

33:52.568 --> 33:55.539
He was packing up his brand-new S.U.V.
And heading out of town.

33:55.664 --> 33:58.073
We caught him just as he was
pulling out of the parking garage.

34:02.042 --> 34:03.811
That son of a bitch.

34:11.699 --> 34:12.601
<i>He shot you...</i>

34:12.726 --> 34:14.255
Here we go.
Let's try this.

34:15.061 --> 34:17.050
<i>This is what I get
for feeling sorry for him.</i>

34:17.750 --> 34:19.572
It's the story of my life.
You know what?

34:19.697 --> 34:22.127
I only married Vince
because I was drunk.

34:25.351 --> 34:28.588
He has a nice body, sure,
but he never knew what to do with it.

34:28.996 --> 34:31.313
It's a lot easier to get decent sex
from a client.

34:33.659 --> 34:36.444
I had nothing to do
with these robberies.

34:36.880 --> 34:38.797
Vince is obviously a psycho.

34:39.708 --> 34:41.282
You know what? He can go to hell.

34:41.449 --> 34:42.922
I don't care about him.

34:43.146 --> 34:44.231
I can't believe...

34:44.356 --> 34:45.357
<i>You bitch!</i>

34:45.482 --> 34:46.646
<i>You bitch!</i>

34:54.179 --> 34:58.067
I couldn't compel Vince to testify
against you, but I knew you could.

34:58.693 --> 35:00.362
You're so good with him.

35:00.718 --> 35:03.159
I'll come back in here
if I need your help.

35:08.950 --> 35:10.794
Well, as you can see,

35:11.545 --> 35:13.940
your relationship
with Kelli's a little one-sided.

35:15.072 --> 35:16.985
She was still having sex
with her clients?

35:17.595 --> 35:20.029
Don't expect her to come visit you
while you're in prison.

35:20.197 --> 35:23.491
She'll be prowling around for some
other guy dumb enough to fall for her,

35:23.659 --> 35:25.576
making him promises
she never means to keep.

35:25.994 --> 35:27.784
Just like she did with you.

35:29.793 --> 35:31.295
I didn't want her stripping,

35:31.420 --> 35:33.189
but she said she needed the money

35:33.531 --> 35:35.450
and her bosses took most of it.

35:36.009 --> 35:37.469
So when I married her,

35:38.145 --> 35:40.548
I promised to get
most of it back for her.

35:42.803 --> 35:44.595
And I thought
we were gonna have a family.

35:46.177 --> 35:48.182
And, and I thought she loved me.

35:51.852 --> 35:53.604
Maybe you should write
all this down.

35:54.513 --> 35:56.190
It always helped for me
to clear my head

35:56.358 --> 35:58.435
when I can put down
what happened on paper.

35:59.424 --> 36:00.467
Right.

36:01.363 --> 36:02.463
Am I looking

36:03.403 --> 36:05.043
at a life sentence here?

36:05.611 --> 36:08.098
From the moment
you were married, my friend.

36:08.440 --> 36:10.476
From the moment you said, "I do."

36:14.793 --> 36:15.793
All right.

36:21.463 --> 36:23.259
<i>What makes a good marriage?</i>

36:25.659 --> 36:26.926
<i>I think patience.</i>

36:27.516 --> 36:28.520
<i>Patience.</i>

36:28.645 --> 36:30.212
<i>And separate bathrooms.</i>

36:31.205 --> 36:33.921
<i>Up until now, you guys had
avoided all the big mistakes</i>

36:34.046 --> 36:35.782
<i>That people make
in a relationship...</i>

36:35.907 --> 36:38.627
<i>Getting married, buying a house,
and having kids.</i>

36:39.303 --> 36:42.570
<i>I look at this wedding today
as a big red flag.</i>

36:43.481 --> 36:46.097
<i>Hi, I just wanted to say that...</i>

36:46.692 --> 36:50.230
<i>I really have enjoyed working
with both of you, truly.</i>

36:50.447 --> 36:51.478
<i>And...</i>

36:51.711 --> 36:54.901
<i>This really couldn't be
happening to two nicer...</i>

36:55.172 --> 36:56.252
<i>people.</i>

36:56.377 --> 36:57.627
<i>Congratulations, you guys.</i>

36:58.204 --> 36:59.956
<i>Hey, you guys, enjoy italy.</i>

37:00.081 --> 37:01.431
<i>You've earned it.</i>

37:02.625 --> 37:06.055
<i>And, make sure you "sleep in"
a lot your first week out.</i>

37:07.586 --> 37:10.340
<i>I don't know much
about successful relationships.</i>

37:10.823 --> 37:11.691
<i>But,</i>

37:11.816 --> 37:13.235
<i>you seem to have one,</i>

37:13.527 --> 37:14.527
<i>and I'm...</i>

37:16.297 --> 37:18.481
<i>I'm happy
to have been a part of your lives.</i>

37:20.645 --> 37:24.409
<i>I just wanted to say it's really nice
to be invited to the reception,</i>

37:24.622 --> 37:27.551
<i>and I hope this little tribute
is something that you will like</i>

37:28.022 --> 37:29.825
<i>and keep and remember.</i>

37:30.993 --> 37:33.801
<i>My wife died six years ago...</i>

37:36.112 --> 37:37.146
<i>And...</i>

37:39.683 --> 37:41.703
<i>I've never taken off her ring.</i>

37:45.475 --> 37:46.485
<i>Always...</i>

37:46.610 --> 37:47.910
<i>love each other.</i>

37:48.590 --> 37:49.428
<i>Always.</i>

37:49.885 --> 37:50.885
<i>Well,</i>

37:51.107 --> 37:52.070
<i>I'm...</i>

37:52.195 --> 37:53.940
<i>happy for you... both.</i>

37:56.046 --> 37:58.445
<i>May each year
bring you closer together.</i>

38:03.197 --> 38:04.197
Sir.

38:04.954 --> 38:05.761
So,

38:06.256 --> 38:07.783
just say something nice?

38:07.908 --> 38:09.308
That's what I did.

38:10.075 --> 38:11.252
All right. All right.

38:15.077 --> 38:16.105
<i>Okay...</i>

38:17.177 --> 38:18.399
<i>Let me think.</i>

38:22.112 --> 38:22.920
Sergeant.

38:24.265 --> 38:26.165
I got your transfer request.

38:28.034 --> 38:29.205
Good, I think,

38:30.350 --> 38:32.721
C.I. would be a good place
to utilize what I've learned.

38:34.155 --> 38:35.883
Well, you may have some competition.

38:36.771 --> 38:38.921
She's about to throw the bouquet.

38:41.039 --> 38:43.787
Wait a minute. You mean
Irene put herself up for the job, too?

38:43.912 --> 38:46.485
She did, without telling
your chief anything about it.

38:47.994 --> 38:50.530
I assume you haven't said
anything to the bride either.

38:51.048 --> 38:52.366
No, sir. I have not.

38:53.084 --> 38:54.084
All right.

38:54.610 --> 38:56.120
Well, let's keep it that way.

39:00.404 --> 39:01.208
Now,

39:01.717 --> 39:04.041
before we leave the bride and groom

39:04.166 --> 39:06.046
so they can get ready
to go Atlanta...

39:06.316 --> 39:08.916
There's just one
last little thing to do.

39:09.921 --> 39:13.095
If all the unmarried people
could step forward just a bit.

39:19.699 --> 39:20.897
You're gonna do this.

39:21.022 --> 39:22.896
Yes. If I'm doing it,
you're doing it.

39:25.264 --> 39:26.314
No peeking.

39:27.154 --> 39:28.164
<i>Get in fast.</i>

39:28.289 --> 39:29.960
Ready, set,

39:30.820 --> 39:31.820
throw!

39:41.553 --> 39:43.697
A win is a win is a win!

39:51.121 --> 39:53.149
Okay, y'all,
just hold on one second.

39:53.274 --> 39:56.138
I'm gonna change out of this dress,
but don't anyone leave, okay?

40:02.702 --> 40:03.702
Hey. Hey.

40:04.546 --> 40:06.357
You feel any different yet?

40:06.550 --> 40:07.660
Yes, I do.

40:08.307 --> 40:11.528
I feel like I know my limitations better
and that you still don't have any.

40:12.379 --> 40:13.385
Come on.

40:13.510 --> 40:16.836
- Why do you even think like that?
- Because, Fritzi,

40:17.743 --> 40:19.693
I love you with all my heart.

40:21.415 --> 40:23.582
But sometimes I think
my heart is only this big.

40:26.145 --> 40:28.245
That's because you can't see it.

40:29.506 --> 40:30.506
Your heart

40:31.521 --> 40:33.592
is large enough
to carry me and the job...

40:34.517 --> 40:35.819
and then some.

40:39.065 --> 40:41.141
I am fully aware
of who I just married.

40:41.638 --> 40:45.185
So hurry up and change,
because I want to dance with you.
