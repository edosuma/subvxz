WEBVTT

00:02.909 --> 00:04.842
crash-landed on Earth. We
came here seeking refuge,

00:04.844 --> 00:08.045
but the Humans thought
that it was an invasion.

00:10.616 --> 00:13.684
That night, I met a Human
girl who tried to protect me...

00:13.686 --> 00:15.953
a girl I never thought I'd see again.

00:15.955 --> 00:18.322
The surviving members
of my race, the Atrians,

00:18.324 --> 00:21.959
were rounded up and isolated
inside a militarized sector.

00:21.961 --> 00:23.794
Now it's 2024.

00:23.796 --> 00:25.763
Seven of us have been
chosen to attend high school

00:25.765 --> 00:28.298
as a part of a government
integration program.

00:28.823 --> 00:29.965
But the Humans and Atrians

00:30.015 --> 00:31.684
continue to distrust each other,

00:31.734 --> 00:34.860
while I fight to protect
my people and the Human girl

00:34.910 --> 00:37.741
who saved my life... at any cost.

00:37.743 --> 00:39.509
Previously on Star-Crossed...

00:39.711 --> 00:41.411
When my mom returned to the Sector,

00:41.413 --> 00:43.480
they wanted her to build
something called the Suvek.

00:43.482 --> 00:46.516
The Suvek? That means "blast" or "flash."

00:46.518 --> 00:48.018
You think it's some kind of bomb?

00:48.020 --> 00:49.352
It's called the Iksen's Key.

00:49.354 --> 00:50.921
We need it to operate the Suvek.

00:50.923 --> 00:52.789
Grenade that almost
killed me was the same kind

00:52.791 --> 00:54.557
of grenade Castor gave
us to destroy black cyper.

00:54.559 --> 00:55.859
He's got to have a whole
stash of them somewhere.

00:55.861 --> 00:57.961
If we can find his stash,

00:57.963 --> 01:00.597
we can use it to blow up the Suvek.

01:01.967 --> 01:05.135
Castor pays for what he has done! Tonight!

01:10.174 --> 01:11.408
Come with me.

01:11.410 --> 01:13.877
It was wise to build the
Suvek to survive attack.

01:13.879 --> 01:14.978
In a few days,

01:14.980 --> 01:17.046
we introduce it to the world.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:28.192 --> 01:30.126
What are those Trags doing?

01:30.128 --> 01:31.361
- Can you see what's inside?
- No, but they're

01:31.363 --> 01:32.562
definitely up to something.

01:33.764 --> 01:36.065
If we can beat them to that catwalk,

01:36.067 --> 01:37.767
we'll get a clearer view.

01:46.643 --> 01:49.345
The Suvek?

01:49.347 --> 01:51.714
How did it survive the explosion?

01:51.716 --> 01:52.882
Where are they taking it?

01:52.884 --> 01:54.050
Go, go.

02:06.697 --> 02:08.264
They're gone?

02:11.201 --> 02:13.369
We lost them!

02:34.457 --> 02:37.293
I'm guessing my mom built the
Suvek to withstand the attack.

02:37.295 --> 02:39.061
There's a reason why
Vega went to great lengths

02:39.063 --> 02:40.729
to get her released from the Crate.

02:40.731 --> 02:42.064
She's the best engineer in the Sector.

02:42.066 --> 02:44.533
Everyone's planning for Mardi Gras.

02:44.535 --> 02:46.669
Meanwhile the Trags have a doomsday device.

02:46.671 --> 02:48.871
How are we gonna get rid of it?

02:48.873 --> 02:50.439
Why don't we go to the Hwatab?

02:50.441 --> 02:52.141
Tell them what we know
about Vega and the Suvek?

02:52.143 --> 02:53.375
We don't have proof.

02:53.377 --> 02:54.743
We know they're hiding it

02:54.745 --> 02:57.079
in Quadrant D somewhere, but that's it.

02:57.081 --> 02:59.081
I know we can't trust the cops with this.

02:59.083 --> 03:00.716
But there's got to be
someone that we can call on

03:00.718 --> 03:04.119
for help that'll believe us.

03:04.121 --> 03:06.321
Actually, there is someone.

03:07.790 --> 03:09.124
But you're not gonna like it.

03:09.126 --> 03:10.392
No, Drake!

03:10.394 --> 03:12.494
We can't do this.

03:12.496 --> 03:13.695
The Trags could use the Suvek

03:13.697 --> 03:15.097
and start a war anytime.

03:15.099 --> 03:16.832
You got a better idea?

03:33.850 --> 03:36.184
Can you give us a minute?

03:36.186 --> 03:38.553
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Yeah.

03:38.555 --> 03:40.288
Anything you need to say
to me, you can say to her.

03:40.290 --> 03:41.656
Yeah, Drake. Didn't you hear?

03:41.658 --> 03:42.724
Emery's a Red Hawk now.

03:42.726 --> 03:44.526
That's not true.

03:45.795 --> 03:47.796
What is this about?

03:47.798 --> 03:49.631
You've been leaning on me for weeks

03:49.633 --> 03:51.466
about information on the Trags.

03:51.468 --> 03:52.801
I think I got something for you.

03:55.504 --> 03:57.906
I'm listening.

03:57.908 --> 03:59.374
The Trags built a weapon.

03:59.376 --> 04:00.809
Something called a Suvek.

04:00.811 --> 04:02.677
We think it's some kind of a bomb.

04:03.579 --> 04:05.180
- A bomb?
- We tried to destroy it.

04:05.182 --> 04:06.848
It didn't work.

04:09.018 --> 04:10.051
So, why are you telling me this?

04:10.053 --> 04:12.687
Because we got a plan B.

04:12.689 --> 04:14.522
We're gonna steal the Suvek from the Trags.

04:14.524 --> 04:16.190
We need your help.

04:16.192 --> 04:19.793
- Why don't you tell the SEU?
- The SEU is a leaky ship.

04:19.796 --> 04:22.730
- They have informants on the inside.
- It's true.

04:22.732 --> 04:24.999
When I was a Trag, Vega
always knew ahead of time

04:25.001 --> 04:27.802
- when the SEU staged a raid.
- Besides,

04:27.804 --> 04:29.637
they'd end up holding
all Atrians accountable.

04:29.639 --> 04:32.140
- Kiss integration good-bye.
- Unless, of course,

04:32.142 --> 04:34.008
that's what you and your
Red Hawks really want.

04:34.010 --> 04:35.877
No, what I want is to go back to the part

04:35.879 --> 04:37.812
where you said you were a Trag.

04:37.814 --> 04:39.614
Now, I'm sorry, but...

04:39.616 --> 04:41.883
How do I know that this
isn't some Trag plot?

04:41.885 --> 04:43.584
Stop it.

04:43.586 --> 04:45.920
I'm no more a Red Hawk than
Roman and Drake are Trags.

04:45.922 --> 04:47.655
And Grayson doesn't want to
end the integration program.

04:47.657 --> 04:49.190
If you'd all just take the testosterone

04:49.192 --> 04:51.592
down a notch, you'd see that we all want

04:51.594 --> 04:53.027
the same thing here, right?

04:57.332 --> 04:58.633
Assuming we actually get
our hands on this thing,

04:58.635 --> 05:00.134
what are we gonna do with it?

05:00.136 --> 05:02.370
We take it to Gloria.

05:02.372 --> 05:04.271
She's the only government
official that we trust

05:04.273 --> 05:05.506
to make sure that the Trags are

05:05.508 --> 05:06.907
the only Atrians sent to the Crate.

05:06.909 --> 05:08.109
Have you even thought

05:08.111 --> 05:09.844
about how we're gonna get it

05:09.846 --> 05:12.046
out of the Sector?

05:18.253 --> 05:19.987
I've got an idea.

05:19.989 --> 05:22.456
But we're gonna need help.

05:23.692 --> 05:25.059
I'm sorry.

05:25.061 --> 05:26.493
You want us to do what?

05:26.495 --> 05:27.861
We're gonna smuggle the Suvek outside

05:27.863 --> 05:29.663
using the Mardi Gras unity float.

05:29.665 --> 05:31.398
I got Gloria to give
us permission to finish

05:31.400 --> 05:33.100
building the float inside
the Sector tomorrow.

05:33.102 --> 05:34.268
She's always looking for new ways

05:34.270 --> 05:35.936
to promote the integration program,

05:35.938 --> 05:38.739
so she's using it as a PR opportunity.

05:38.741 --> 05:39.940
Well, nothing says unity
like trying to dismantle

05:39.942 --> 05:41.975
a Atrian terrorist plot together.

05:41.977 --> 05:43.577
I knew the Trags were
vicious, but I never thought

05:43.579 --> 05:44.745
they'd go this far.

05:44.747 --> 05:46.280
Think of it this way... if we fail

05:46.282 --> 05:47.748
and the Trags detonate that thing,

05:47.750 --> 05:49.583
a whole lot of people
are gonna end up dead.

05:49.585 --> 05:52.219
And now this "Sumac" thing and the Trags
detonate thais gonna wipe us all out?

05:52.221 --> 05:54.188
Why aren't we going to
the police about this?

05:54.190 --> 05:55.389
Suvek.

05:55.391 --> 05:56.924
And even if the police believe us,

05:56.926 --> 05:58.158
there'll be all kinds of Atrian backlash

05:58.160 --> 06:00.127
not just the Trags.

06:00.129 --> 06:02.929
- How many people know about this?
- Just the six of us.

06:02.931 --> 06:03.997
It's safest that way.

06:03.999 --> 06:05.399
Yeah, so don't go phoning

06:05.401 --> 06:07.167
your Red Hawk pals.

06:07.169 --> 06:08.769
Okay, first thing we need to do

06:08.771 --> 06:10.103
is figure out where the
Trags are keeping it.

06:10.105 --> 06:11.138
They got a new hideout.

06:11.140 --> 06:12.372
We find that, we find the Suvek.

06:12.374 --> 06:14.708
Can't we just ask Teri or Saroya?

06:14.710 --> 06:17.577
Nobody has seen or heard from Teri in days.

06:17.579 --> 06:19.179
Besides we don't know where
her loyalties lie anymore.

06:19.181 --> 06:20.580
Isn't there anyone

06:20.582 --> 06:21.848
in the SEU that we can trust?

06:21.850 --> 06:23.183
Afraid not.

06:23.185 --> 06:24.751
But we think we might have a way to use

06:24.753 --> 06:26.119
their shadiness to our advantage.

06:26.121 --> 06:27.320
After we find the Suvek.

06:27.322 --> 06:28.522
Show them the map.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.191
I need to talk to you.

06:31.193 --> 06:34.794
All right, this is what we're thinking.

06:37.766 --> 06:41.001
The float's gonna be entering...

06:43.871 --> 06:45.538
The whole reason we broke up

06:45.540 --> 06:47.974
was so I could deal with my
people and the Trags alone,

06:47.976 --> 06:49.442
without having to worry about your safety.

06:49.444 --> 06:51.177
And now Grayson is

06:51.179 --> 06:53.146
pulling you back into this.

06:53.148 --> 06:54.781
Okay, I made the decision
to do this, not Grayson.

06:54.783 --> 06:56.983
You have to accept the fact that he's not

06:56.985 --> 06:58.485
- who you think he is.
- For ten years,

06:58.487 --> 07:00.887
he's been told that my people are a threat.

07:00.889 --> 07:03.056
An abomination. You
can't tell me that someone

07:03.058 --> 07:05.124
who grows up with parents like
that is not affected by it.

07:05.126 --> 07:07.160
I am telling you that. We just spent

07:07.162 --> 07:09.095
the last three hours talking
about Atrians who want to see me

07:09.097 --> 07:11.931
and everyone I care about
splattered across Edendale.

07:11.933 --> 07:13.500
Do you really think you have
a leg to stand on here?

07:13.525 --> 07:14.301
Emery,

07:14.302 --> 07:15.768
There are Atrians that are still angry

07:15.770 --> 07:17.103
that we were even together.

07:17.105 --> 07:18.671
What are they gonna think when you come

07:18.673 --> 07:20.707
waltzing into the Sector with a Montrose?

07:20.709 --> 07:23.309
I'm doing this because
people's lives are in danger.

07:23.311 --> 07:24.677
And so that maybe, someday, hopefully,

07:24.679 --> 07:27.847
you and I can be together again.

07:29.016 --> 07:31.684
I thought that's what you wanted, too.

07:31.686 --> 07:34.353
Of course that's what I want.

07:39.193 --> 07:41.961
I just need you to be safe.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.697
Then you have to do whatever it takes

07:44.699 --> 07:46.399
to trust Grayson.

07:49.636 --> 07:52.538
This is the only way this is gonna work.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.251
Feeling better?

08:05.253 --> 08:08.187
Much stronger.

08:08.189 --> 08:09.588
Thanks to you.

08:09.590 --> 08:12.491
Did you have any trouble

08:12.493 --> 08:14.226
getting into my pod?

08:14.228 --> 08:15.728
The Hwatab posted a guard.

08:15.730 --> 08:17.730
He'll have a headache in the morning.

08:17.732 --> 08:20.299
Remind me never to get on your bad side.

08:23.470 --> 08:25.004
A poison kos?

08:25.006 --> 08:27.239
I need to neutralize the Trags

08:27.241 --> 08:29.975
and overthrow the Hwatab.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.810
They're both hunting me.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.846
What's that?

08:33.847 --> 08:35.948
The legend is that this belonged

08:35.950 --> 08:37.349
to the Abor Atedi.

08:37.351 --> 08:39.451
The first Iksen?

08:39.453 --> 08:40.751
The father of all Atrians.

08:40.754 --> 08:42.888
It's gorgeous.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.155
It's for you.

08:44.158 --> 08:45.958
That is,

08:45.960 --> 08:47.626
if you will join me.

08:58.971 --> 09:02.507
I want you wearing it by
my side when I take back

09:02.509 --> 09:04.676
the Sector.

09:18.925 --> 09:22.494
It's never looked more beautiful.

09:22.496 --> 09:25.563
Were you able to connect with my followers?

09:25.565 --> 09:28.533
They asked me to give this to you.

09:31.437 --> 09:33.538
It says that the Hwatab is on the verge

09:33.540 --> 09:35.507
of announcing Roman as the new Iksen.

09:35.509 --> 09:36.941
I thought Roman was out of favor

09:36.943 --> 09:38.309
after his tryst with Emery?

09:39.645 --> 09:42.213
The council has chosen
to support integration.

09:42.215 --> 09:46.518
They want to capitalize
on Roman's open-mindedness.

09:46.520 --> 09:49.120
I know that you and Roman
have a history together.

09:49.122 --> 09:51.222
Roman was fun when I was younger.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.892
But I've tired of him.

09:53.894 --> 09:56.861
I crave someone stronger.

09:56.863 --> 09:58.796
Wiser.

09:58.798 --> 10:01.132
Someone who will open me up.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.568
I don't know if you've noticed,

10:03.570 --> 10:07.805
but... I'm not a little girl anymore.

10:07.807 --> 10:10.942
I think that you and I are gonna do

10:10.944 --> 10:12.577
great things together.

10:23.952 --> 10:26.253
The krewe of students will
be building the float today

10:26.255 --> 10:28.589
in preparation for the start

10:28.591 --> 10:30.224
of Mardi Gras festivities tomorrow.

10:30.226 --> 10:33.027
The float is a symbol of
the growing trust and peace

10:33.029 --> 10:34.328
between our two races.

10:34.330 --> 10:36.397
All right, let 'em through!

11:11.299 --> 11:13.901
The Trags are finally in the Marketplace.

11:13.903 --> 11:15.836
Are you sure you're ready for this?

11:15.838 --> 11:17.971
I am. Are you?

11:17.973 --> 11:19.239
Whatever it takes.

11:19.241 --> 11:22.009
That's what you said, right?

11:23.778 --> 11:26.880
Too bad we can't fight off
the Trags with papier-mâché.

11:27.515 --> 11:29.016
So how do we find this Suvek?

11:29.018 --> 11:30.550
Ever since the explosion,

11:30.552 --> 11:32.519
the Trags have been loading up
on supplies. They're restocking

11:32.521 --> 11:34.654
- their new base camp.
- We know what quadrant

11:34.656 --> 11:37.157
it's in, we just don't
know its exact location.

11:37.159 --> 11:39.059
The good news is they have
no idea that we're onto them.

11:39.061 --> 11:40.727
I should be able to follow

11:40.729 --> 11:43.096
the Trags to the Marketplace
without them suspecting.

11:43.098 --> 11:44.965
They should lead us straight to it.

11:44.967 --> 11:46.333
I'm coming with you.

11:46.335 --> 11:48.568
No, you'll be recognized.

11:48.570 --> 11:50.704
- It's way too dangerous.
- You can't do this alone.

11:50.706 --> 11:52.439
What if they catch you following them?

11:52.441 --> 11:53.840
Roman, she's right.

11:53.842 --> 11:55.408
Locating the hideout only works

11:55.410 --> 11:57.911
if you make it back alive
to tell us where it is.

11:57.913 --> 11:59.946
I'll go with you.

12:02.183 --> 12:04.117
I'm gonna talk to my mom.

12:04.119 --> 12:06.486
She knows the Suvek better than anyone.

12:06.488 --> 12:09.289
Gotta figure out how to safely
get it outside the Sector.

12:09.291 --> 12:10.657
What makes you think she's
going to give up the details?

12:10.659 --> 12:12.092
I mean, she did build the thing.

12:12.094 --> 12:14.994
She's no Trag, okay?

12:14.996 --> 12:18.031
Don't forget, we have to do
all of this before curfew.

12:18.033 --> 12:19.799
We should go. Be ready to move

12:19.801 --> 12:21.301
the moment we get back.

12:32.112 --> 12:33.479
You want to slow down?

12:33.481 --> 12:34.814
You shouldn't have come.

12:34.816 --> 12:36.382
Humans in the Sector draw attention.

12:36.384 --> 12:38.251
Especially ones whose
parents are known terrorists.

12:38.253 --> 12:39.919
I think you could use the help.

12:39.921 --> 12:41.320
From what Emery's told me,

12:41.322 --> 12:44.157
the Trags make the Red Hawks
look like the PTA.

12:46.927 --> 12:48.461
Hey.

12:48.463 --> 12:52.131
That's Sargas. It's one
of Vega's top soldiers.

12:52.133 --> 12:53.232
That's who we follow.

12:53.234 --> 12:55.001
How do you know he's gonna take us

12:55.003 --> 12:57.737
to the hideout, huh? He could just
as easily take us grocery shopping.

12:57.739 --> 12:59.839
In here, you follow my lead. You got that?

12:59.841 --> 13:01.307
That's funny, I seem to remember

13:01.309 --> 13:04.176
some Atrians coming to
my lunch table yesterday

13:04.178 --> 13:06.212
asking me for help.

13:17.958 --> 13:19.825
Your boy's on the move.

13:21.428 --> 13:24.330
Come on. We're gonna lose him.

13:29.736 --> 13:32.571
So how long have you known
the Trags have been planning

13:32.573 --> 13:34.273
- this attack on Humans?
- Keep it down!

13:34.275 --> 13:36.442
Knowing the Trags have
a weapon against Humans

13:36.444 --> 13:39.211
is a pretty big secret to keep
from people you claim to care about.

13:39.213 --> 13:40.913
And by "people" you mean Emery?

13:40.915 --> 13:43.515
Look, man, I'm just trying to
figure out what side you're on.

13:43.517 --> 13:44.750
Here's a question for you:

13:44.752 --> 13:46.452
How long did you know your parents

13:46.454 --> 13:47.786
were leading a terrorist organization?

13:47.788 --> 13:50.055
- They lied to me.
- You protected the Red Hawks

13:50.057 --> 13:51.323
even after they threatened my sister,

13:51.325 --> 13:53.158
and planned an attack on the Sector,

13:53.160 --> 13:56.495
so I got a pretty good idea
of whose side you're on.

14:00.033 --> 14:02.968
Looks like a pretty good
place to hide a weapon.

14:02.970 --> 14:05.070
Come on. Let's go.

14:09.043 --> 14:11.276
Emery, I think we found the hideout.

14:13.680 --> 14:15.347
This should help bind the wound.

14:15.349 --> 14:16.715
Good.

14:16.717 --> 14:18.583
'Cause I have to act tonight

14:18.585 --> 14:21.286
if I have any hope of taking
back control of the Sector.

14:21.288 --> 14:24.656
Relax. Your body's still healing.

14:24.658 --> 14:27.893
If you move too quickly, it'll tear open.

14:27.895 --> 14:31.863
You still have plenty of
followers inside the Sector.

14:31.865 --> 14:33.965
Roman cannot become Iksen.

14:33.967 --> 14:35.734
I'm the only one with the vision

14:35.736 --> 14:38.103
to build a sovereign nation for our people.

14:42.309 --> 14:44.109
What can I do to help?

14:44.111 --> 14:49.047
You have proven to me to be loyal,

14:49.049 --> 14:50.515
resourceful.

14:50.517 --> 14:53.918
Give me something about the Trags

14:53.920 --> 14:56.221
that I can use.

15:09.768 --> 15:12.704
The Trags are building a weapon.

15:12.706 --> 15:15.406
Something they plan to
use against the Humans.

15:15.408 --> 15:17.342
I don't know much more than that.

15:17.344 --> 15:19.410
Thanks for telling me that.

15:19.412 --> 15:23.681
That...

15:23.683 --> 15:25.249
I can use.

15:31.023 --> 15:32.490
I just heard from Grayson.

15:32.492 --> 15:34.158
They found the hideout. Corridor D.

15:34.160 --> 15:36.427
Through a green door three
blocks east of the Market.

15:36.429 --> 15:39.297
I should go. We don't have much time.

15:39.299 --> 15:41.966
Remember, they have to
believe every word you say.

15:41.991 --> 15:43.491
And be careful.

15:47.639 --> 15:49.674
I thought Castor was
the one who tried

15:49.676 --> 15:51.108
to blow up the Suvek.

15:51.110 --> 15:53.878
We used his explosives,
hoping to pin it on him.

15:53.880 --> 15:56.647
I used panels from the
ship to protect the Suvek,

15:56.649 --> 15:58.916
so Castor's grenades barely left a scratch.

15:58.918 --> 16:00.117
Which is why I need your help.

16:00.119 --> 16:01.952
We need to steal the Suvek

16:01.954 --> 16:03.354
and get it outside the Sector.

16:03.356 --> 16:04.689
Have you not learned anything?

16:04.691 --> 16:07.024
Stay away from Vega!

16:07.026 --> 16:09.026
You've already put
yourself in enough danger.

16:09.028 --> 16:11.495
Just... let it go.

16:11.497 --> 16:13.030
Mom, please.

16:13.032 --> 16:15.533
This is the only way to
avoid war with the Humans.

16:15.535 --> 16:19.770
You might think this is worth
getting yourself killed over,

16:19.772 --> 16:22.006
but I don't! I want more for you.

16:22.008 --> 16:24.141
And I want more for the both of us.

16:24.143 --> 16:26.610
Outside these walls,
there's a better life...

16:26.612 --> 16:27.678
together.

16:27.680 --> 16:31.649
Which is why we can't let Vega win.

16:33.318 --> 16:36.887
I'm not gonna convince you to stop, am I?

16:38.156 --> 16:40.290
No.

16:40.292 --> 16:43.193
All right...

16:44.963 --> 16:46.730
I'll help you.

16:48.533 --> 16:50.400
But the Suvek is complicated.

16:50.402 --> 16:52.870
If you want to know how to move
it out of the Sector safely,

16:52.872 --> 16:57.274
you're gonna have to sit
down and listen closely.

17:07.919 --> 17:09.519
I'm so sorry.

17:24.522 --> 17:26.558
Please, it's an emergency.

17:26.560 --> 17:28.660
There's gonna be an attack.

17:28.662 --> 17:29.961
What?

17:29.963 --> 17:31.563
The Trags built a bomb.

17:31.565 --> 17:32.797
I don't know what they're planning,

17:32.799 --> 17:35.433
but I can tell you where to find it.

17:36.268 --> 17:39.571
I need a response team, code nine.

17:53.285 --> 17:55.219
I'm starting to think you
don't know where we're going.

17:55.221 --> 17:56.888
We've got to be up high enough

17:56.890 --> 17:59.724
so we can see which way
the Trags move the Suvek.

18:09.501 --> 18:12.103
Stay here. I gotta take care of something.

18:12.105 --> 18:13.404
What, are you serious?

18:13.406 --> 18:14.739
What could be more important...?

18:20.946 --> 18:22.947
Teri!

18:22.949 --> 18:25.750
Where have you been these last few days?

18:25.752 --> 18:29.353
Last I checked, you aren't
someone I owe explanations to.

18:29.355 --> 18:32.089
This cuff, it's been in
my family for generations.

18:32.091 --> 18:34.925
The last time I saw it,
Castor was wearing it.

18:35.794 --> 18:37.862
And you're stockpiling herbs?

18:37.864 --> 18:39.396
Castor's injured.

18:39.398 --> 18:40.965
The Trags have him, don't they?

18:40.967 --> 18:43.133
- Let me go.
- Castor tried to kill me.

18:43.135 --> 18:45.169
He's dangerous, Teri. Don't you get that?

18:45.171 --> 18:47.871
You always expect the worst from me.

18:47.873 --> 18:50.374
So nothing I do should
really come as a shock to you.

18:50.376 --> 18:53.844
Wait. I care about what happens to you,

18:53.846 --> 18:55.646
more than you know.

18:55.648 --> 18:57.247
I don't want to see you get hurt,

18:57.249 --> 18:58.949
but if you keep getting
mixed up with my uncle,

18:58.951 --> 19:01.852
that's what will happen.

19:18.336 --> 19:21.138
Vega, we got a tip. The SEU's on their way.

19:21.140 --> 19:22.372
Move it.

19:22.374 --> 19:24.041
Now!

19:31.449 --> 19:32.816
If the plan worked,

19:32.818 --> 19:34.951
the Trags should be moving
the Suvek any second.

19:36.554 --> 19:39.055
Stay low. Follow my lead.

19:44.128 --> 19:46.830
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

19:46.832 --> 19:51.434
Hands where I can see 'em!
Hands where I can see 'em!

19:51.436 --> 19:53.770
Can I help you gentlemen?

20:01.345 --> 20:04.180
There. There!

20:04.182 --> 20:05.248
Call Emery.

20:05.250 --> 20:07.484
That's got to be it.

20:11.088 --> 20:12.689
Okay.

20:12.691 --> 20:14.858
Got it.

20:17.461 --> 20:18.661
It worked.

20:18.663 --> 20:20.964
It's on the move.

20:27.504 --> 20:30.006
There you go.

20:30.008 --> 20:31.574
Come on, Drake.

20:31.576 --> 20:33.276
There you go.

20:33.278 --> 20:35.178
What are you doing?

20:36.113 --> 20:38.314
Why am I...

20:38.316 --> 20:39.615
You left me no choice, Drake.

20:39.617 --> 20:41.684
If I don't get to the Suvek...

20:41.686 --> 20:43.119
If you try and steal the Suvek,

20:43.121 --> 20:44.454
the Trags will kill you.

20:44.456 --> 20:45.888
We're trying to stop a war.

20:45.890 --> 20:47.490
What part of that don't you understand?

20:47.492 --> 20:49.492
If you do this, you will start a war.

20:49.494 --> 20:50.993
You're going to keep me tied up here

20:50.995 --> 20:52.161
while my friends risk their lives

20:52.163 --> 20:53.462
trying to steal that thing?

20:53.464 --> 20:55.965
It can't be done. Do you hear me?

20:56.834 --> 20:59.135
Vega had me build in safeguards.

20:59.137 --> 21:00.503
The second

21:00.505 --> 21:02.171
the Suvek passes out of the Sector,

21:02.173 --> 21:03.839
it will release an electrical pulse...

21:07.311 --> 21:09.879
that will kill anyone within 30 feet.

21:23.329 --> 21:27.165
Hey. Wait. Drake's not back yet.

21:27.167 --> 21:29.467
It's too risky, trying to
take the Suvek without backup.

21:29.469 --> 21:30.702
We got one chance to do this.

21:30.704 --> 21:32.037
I'm not letting it slip by

21:32.039 --> 21:33.505
because you're waiting on your boyfriend.

21:38.811 --> 21:41.413
- Is there a problem?
- Yes, if you don't get your hands off me.

21:41.415 --> 21:43.748
- You need to keep it together.
- And you need to get out of my face.

21:43.750 --> 21:45.817
You've been on me ever
since we got to the Sector.

21:45.819 --> 21:47.886
I can't take a leak without
you second-guessing me.

21:47.888 --> 21:49.888
Well, what'd you expect, a welcome basket?

21:49.890 --> 21:51.723
Your Red Hawk parents
tried to blow up the Sector!

21:53.660 --> 21:55.960
You know, you might have Emery believing

21:55.962 --> 21:57.795
that you have nothing to do
with it, but I'm not buying it.

21:57.797 --> 21:59.297
That's what this is about, isn't it?

21:59.299 --> 22:01.432
Emery? She left you
and you can't handle it.

22:01.434 --> 22:02.867
You say one more word...

22:02.869 --> 22:04.535
What's the problem?

22:04.537 --> 22:05.870
Oh, that's right.

22:05.872 --> 22:07.004
You don't like to remind your people

22:07.006 --> 22:09.006
that you went out with a Human.

22:09.008 --> 22:10.541
No wonder she left you.

22:26.692 --> 22:28.893
Once we get the Suvek loaded
onto the float, I need you two

22:28.895 --> 22:30.227
to get the other students
and bring them to the gates.

22:30.229 --> 22:31.996
I'll pick up the boys
and we'll meet you there.

22:31.998 --> 22:33.231
- Got it.
- The sooner we get rid of this thing,

22:33.256 --> 22:33.756
the better.

22:45.711 --> 22:47.011
You know, the longer you keep me here,

22:47.013 --> 22:48.579
the more danger my friends are in.

22:48.581 --> 22:49.713
Your friends shouldn't have

22:49.715 --> 22:50.881
picked a fight they can't win.

22:50.883 --> 22:51.849
Come on...

22:51.851 --> 22:52.983
All we can do now

22:52.985 --> 22:54.518
is find a way to survive.

22:55.353 --> 22:56.821
I'm friends with Weeble.

22:56.823 --> 22:57.922
He told me about an old tunnel

22:57.924 --> 22:59.190
that leads out of the Sector.

22:59.192 --> 23:00.591
It was blown open by the hurricane.

23:00.593 --> 23:02.493
We can use it to escape to Eljida.

23:02.495 --> 23:03.627
We can start

23:03.629 --> 23:04.795
a whole new life, w...

23:04.797 --> 23:06.997
we can be free.

23:08.266 --> 23:09.600
I lost you once.

23:09.602 --> 23:11.735
And every day I was in the Crate,

23:11.737 --> 23:15.606
I swore I would never
let that happen again.

23:17.275 --> 23:19.109
Until you're a parent,

23:19.111 --> 23:20.811
you can't understand the pain

23:20.813 --> 23:22.579
of letting your child go...

23:22.581 --> 23:24.481
of knowing there's a chance

23:24.483 --> 23:26.383
he could get hurt.

23:29.154 --> 23:31.021
Mom, I need you to listen to me right now.

23:31.023 --> 23:32.823
If anything happens to my friends

23:32.825 --> 23:34.791
because I wasn't there to help them,

23:34.793 --> 23:36.727
you will lose me.

23:36.729 --> 23:38.762
For good.

23:38.764 --> 23:41.164
Because I'll never be able to forgive you.

23:42.867 --> 23:44.935
We always go back for our own.

23:44.937 --> 23:46.370
You taught me that!

23:46.372 --> 23:48.672
As a warrior.

23:49.774 --> 23:52.008
Doesn't that mean anything anymore?

24:06.858 --> 24:08.625
Go to your friends.

24:08.627 --> 24:10.493
Before I change my mind.

24:13.497 --> 24:14.965
The Suvek's security

24:14.967 --> 24:17.634
can only be disabled remotely. I'll do it.

24:17.636 --> 24:19.369
I'll send a signal when I'm done.

24:19.371 --> 24:21.438
Thank you.

24:22.673 --> 24:24.207
Come back to me.

24:24.209 --> 24:25.642
I will.

24:25.644 --> 24:27.343
I promise.

24:39.823 --> 24:41.724
These are Trag phones.

24:41.726 --> 24:43.560
Not just any Trag phones.

24:43.562 --> 24:45.028
I've doctored them with messages

24:45.030 --> 24:47.397
about planning an attack
against the Humans.

24:47.399 --> 24:48.932
My followers will plant the phones

24:48.934 --> 24:51.334
in the pods of the Hwatab elders.

24:51.336 --> 24:54.070
Their pods are the most
secure in the Sector.

24:54.072 --> 24:57.006
Even my mother can't get into them.

24:57.008 --> 24:58.708
Your mother...

24:58.710 --> 25:01.444
doesn't have this.

25:06.216 --> 25:08.584
It's the Iksen's Key.

25:08.586 --> 25:10.887
It can open any Atrian lock.

25:10.889 --> 25:13.089
Once the phones are planted,

25:13.091 --> 25:14.390
I'll call Gloria

25:14.392 --> 25:15.525
and tell her

25:15.527 --> 25:16.792
that Vega and the Hwatab

25:16.794 --> 25:18.227
are working together, planning

25:18.229 --> 25:20.563
a strike against the Humans.

25:20.565 --> 25:21.931
Gloria will order a raid.

25:21.933 --> 25:23.532
She'll find the Suvek

25:23.534 --> 25:24.967
and the phones you planted.

25:24.969 --> 25:26.802
And the Hwatab and my mother

25:26.804 --> 25:28.237
will be sent to the Crate.

25:28.239 --> 25:30.339
How do you feel about that?

25:33.143 --> 25:34.543
My whole life

25:34.545 --> 25:36.746
I worked towards earning my mother's love.

25:36.748 --> 25:38.380
Her trust.

25:38.382 --> 25:40.549
Took me 16 years to realize

25:40.551 --> 25:41.984
she had none to give.

25:41.986 --> 25:43.819
To her, I was just something

25:43.821 --> 25:45.855
to be used.

25:48.992 --> 25:51.760
I hope I'm worth more than that to you.

25:52.762 --> 25:54.129
I trusted you with my life.

25:54.131 --> 25:56.265
What further proof do you need?

25:56.267 --> 25:59.802
Your plan to take down
the Hwatab has one flaw.

25:59.804 --> 26:01.003
My mother's Trags

26:01.005 --> 26:02.438
will be watching your followers.

26:02.440 --> 26:05.374
She'll stop them before they make a move.

26:05.376 --> 26:06.775
Let me plant the phones.

26:06.777 --> 26:09.044
Let me prove my worth to you.

26:32.168 --> 26:34.569
What about Roman?

26:34.571 --> 26:36.271
Are you sending him to the Crate, too?

26:36.273 --> 26:38.874
I have other plans for Roman.

26:52.288 --> 26:53.588
Emery!

26:54.290 --> 26:55.390
Roman!

26:55.392 --> 26:57.192
The Suvek's in the back.

26:57.194 --> 27:00.161
All right, let's go.

27:03.199 --> 27:05.166
What the hell?

27:08.471 --> 27:10.238
We got a problem.

27:11.974 --> 27:13.208
The Suvek has a safeguard.

27:13.210 --> 27:14.609
The second it leaves the Sector,

27:14.611 --> 27:16.745
it's gonna send an electrical charge

27:16.747 --> 27:18.680
that'll kill anyone within 30 feet.

27:18.682 --> 27:21.349
That's not our only problem.

27:35.775 --> 27:38.448
My mother will signal when she'll
disarm the Suvek defenses.

27:38.544 --> 27:40.979
- We gotta give her more time.
- Whatever happens,

27:40.981 --> 27:42.681
don't let them near the
Suvek. Stay at the wheel.

27:42.683 --> 27:43.782
Be ready to drive out of here

27:43.784 --> 27:45.550
the moment we get that signal.

27:59.399 --> 28:00.999
Roman!

28:11.613 --> 28:14.613
_

28:16.549 --> 28:18.249
Roman!

28:18.251 --> 28:19.684
Let him go!

28:23.889 --> 28:25.957
Emery!

28:28.661 --> 28:30.228
Call off your friends.

28:30.230 --> 28:31.863
Or I put a hole in her head.

28:34.200 --> 28:36.100
I was just checking the Suvek's security.

28:36.102 --> 28:37.235
I heard there was a raid.

28:37.237 --> 28:38.937
Let's see what Vega has to say.

28:43.108 --> 28:45.810
Let's not.

28:59.591 --> 29:00.892
That's the signal.

29:08.734 --> 29:10.134
Emery! Go!

29:11.404 --> 29:12.603
Go!

29:13.772 --> 29:14.906
Okay...

29:20.113 --> 29:22.546
Grab my hand.

29:32.674 --> 29:34.174
_

29:41.163 --> 29:42.729
We're watching live as the first

29:43.254 --> 29:45.821
Atrian-Human float
emerges from the Sector...

30:21.973 --> 30:24.107
So, I just got off the phone with Gloria.

30:24.109 --> 30:27.077
I'm gonna meet her at the school in
a half hour and give her the Suvek.

30:27.079 --> 30:28.478
Hopefully, by tomorrow
morning, the Trags will be

30:28.480 --> 30:29.846
on their way to the Crate.

30:29.848 --> 30:31.548
Sorry about the punch.

30:31.550 --> 30:33.417
It's okay.

30:34.419 --> 30:36.186
I figure after what my parents did,

30:36.188 --> 30:38.689
we're even.

30:40.525 --> 30:42.125
Hang on a sec.

30:42.127 --> 30:45.762
Are you sure you don't
want me to go with you?

30:47.031 --> 30:48.432
I'm driving a ten-foot mammoth head

30:48.434 --> 30:51.067
over a weapon of mass destruction.

30:51.069 --> 30:53.303
It's probably best I go alone.

30:53.305 --> 30:55.472
You and Roman managed to work together.

30:55.474 --> 30:58.475
It could be the start of
a beautiful friendship.

30:58.477 --> 31:00.543
I don't think so.

31:00.545 --> 31:02.913
There are just some things Roman and I

31:02.915 --> 31:04.781
will never see eye to eye on.

31:08.586 --> 31:10.720
Right, um...

31:10.722 --> 31:12.355
Well, you should get going.

31:13.357 --> 31:15.558
Text me when you get there.

31:20.064 --> 31:21.631
What are you gonna do tonight?

31:21.633 --> 31:23.766
You can't just go back into the Sector.

31:23.768 --> 31:25.034
I'll be fine.

31:25.036 --> 31:26.536
I know every hiding spot in there.

31:26.538 --> 31:29.105
What about the Trags?

31:29.107 --> 31:30.673
Although, I would feel a little safer

31:30.675 --> 31:32.508
if you and your can of
pepper spray were around.

31:32.510 --> 31:34.811
Ha-ha-ha.

31:42.520 --> 31:44.387
All I can think about is kissing you.

31:45.356 --> 31:49.325
If we started, I wouldn't know how to stop.

31:56.467 --> 31:58.401
We took down the Trags today.

31:59.670 --> 32:03.739
We're one step closer to being together.

32:08.178 --> 32:10.112
I'll see you tomorrow.

32:10.114 --> 32:12.148
It's Mardi Gras.

32:39.910 --> 32:42.711
What are you doing here?

32:47.684 --> 32:49.718
I brought you a gift.

32:52.789 --> 32:54.490
The Iksen's Key?

32:55.525 --> 32:57.393
It's operational?

32:57.395 --> 33:00.262
I tested it on our lock just to sure.

33:00.264 --> 33:02.164
I didn't think you'd get it this quickly.

33:02.166 --> 33:03.799
And Castor?

33:03.801 --> 33:05.634
Castor suspects nothing.

33:06.636 --> 33:08.670
Now we can arm the Suvek.

33:08.672 --> 33:09.738
And you,

33:09.740 --> 33:11.106
my daughter,

33:11.108 --> 33:15.077
have more than surpassed my expectations.

33:16.112 --> 33:17.679
We have what we need from Castor.

33:17.681 --> 33:20.082
You know what needs to be done.

33:21.885 --> 33:23.819
What is it?

33:30.693 --> 33:32.728
Get out!

33:33.730 --> 33:35.464
What's wrong?

33:35.466 --> 33:38.733
The Suvek was stolen by
Roman and his friends.

33:40.536 --> 33:41.670
What are we gonna do?

33:41.672 --> 33:44.105
The game isn't over.

33:44.107 --> 33:46.675
We have one more piece to play.

34:10.466 --> 34:12.233
Hello, Roman.

34:18.434 --> 34:20.333
You have to know how much

34:20.335 --> 34:21.601
it pains me to do this,

34:21.603 --> 34:23.303
but, Roman, you and I could've ruled

34:23.304 --> 34:25.071
the Sector together.

34:25.072 --> 34:27.507
But you had to ruin everything.

35:20.360 --> 35:22.728
I told you I would handle Roman.

35:22.730 --> 35:25.465
He got away,

35:25.467 --> 35:27.400
but he can't escape the poison.

35:30.070 --> 35:32.471
Are you upset?

35:38.345 --> 35:42.081
I'm only upset the effort
reopened your wound.

35:42.083 --> 35:44.250
Let me.

36:14.180 --> 36:16.248
There.

36:17.250 --> 36:19.852
All better.

36:30.897 --> 36:34.066
I can't believe
Weeble's tunnel worked.

36:34.068 --> 36:35.767
The SEU does sweeps here all the time.

36:35.769 --> 36:37.769
It'll probably be
boarded up by the morning.

36:42.275 --> 36:43.875
Mom, you okay?

36:43.877 --> 36:47.246
It's been a long time since I was free.

36:47.248 --> 36:49.147
Let's get moving.

36:49.149 --> 36:50.782
Mom, wait.

36:51.918 --> 36:53.618
I kept my promise.

36:53.620 --> 36:56.188
I came back.

36:56.190 --> 36:58.590
But I can't go to Eljida with you.

36:58.592 --> 36:59.925
I'm not leaving without you.

36:59.927 --> 37:01.393
I get how you feel,

37:01.395 --> 37:03.595
which is why I hope you'll understand.

37:03.597 --> 37:05.697
Her name is Taylor.

37:05.699 --> 37:07.265
She's a Human.

37:09.836 --> 37:12.003
And she's pregnant with my child.

37:13.440 --> 37:16.441
I-I can't run away from that.

37:16.443 --> 37:18.243
From her.

37:18.245 --> 37:20.078
So...

37:20.080 --> 37:21.980
So, I-I'll stay.

37:21.982 --> 37:23.148
I'll help you and Taylor

37:23.150 --> 37:24.983
- figure out what to do.
- You have a chance

37:24.985 --> 37:26.885
to be free now.

37:26.887 --> 37:28.019
- No, Drake.
- You need to take it.

37:28.021 --> 37:29.754
I can come and go,

37:29.756 --> 37:31.589
but you will always be
trapped in the Sector,

37:31.591 --> 37:33.992
and you know I'm right.

37:33.994 --> 37:36.828
And when things calm down,

37:36.830 --> 37:39.030
I'll come find you in Eljida.

37:40.666 --> 37:42.233
But that's not gonna happen

37:42.235 --> 37:45.036
unless you leave tonight.

37:46.605 --> 37:50.575
You were so small when
they took you from me.

37:50.577 --> 37:52.477
And now I...

37:54.480 --> 37:56.447
I can't lose you again.

37:59.452 --> 38:00.785
You won't.

38:00.787 --> 38:02.987
I promise.

38:07.760 --> 38:11.829
Stay with me, just a little while longer.

38:32.985 --> 38:36.320
Touchdown!

38:36.322 --> 38:37.988
Or whatever.

39:25.870 --> 39:27.604
Hello.

39:38.249 --> 39:39.816
Roman, oh, my God.

39:42.120 --> 39:44.388
What happened?

39:44.390 --> 39:45.622
How did you get here?

39:45.624 --> 39:47.824
I needed someplace safe.

39:48.393 --> 39:50.060
All I could think of

39:50.062 --> 39:51.595
was this place.

39:55.333 --> 39:58.235
I'm here.

39:58.237 --> 40:00.136
Stay with me.
