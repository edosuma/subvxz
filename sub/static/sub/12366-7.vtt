<i>Hot in Cleveland is recorded
in front of a live studio audience.</i>

00:04.764 --> 00:06.614
Mel...
Your taxi is here.

00:06.615 --> 00:08.752
Coming...

00:08.753 --> 00:10.498
Oh... puppy tails!

00:10.499 --> 00:13.201
Melanie, please.
Language.

00:13.202 --> 00:14.736
Is that what you're
wearing on the plane?

00:14.737 --> 00:17.605
Mm. Someone's looking
to get bumped to first class.

00:17.606 --> 00:19.207
No, as soon
as I get to New York

00:19.208 --> 00:20.841
I have to rush
straight to Jenna's play.

00:20.842 --> 00:22.309
I'm not gonna
have time to change.

00:22.310 --> 00:24.475
That's a lot of boobage
for your daughter's play.

00:25.840 --> 00:29.673
Nice girls keep
their cookies in a jar.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.562
Yes, I know,

00:34.563 --> 00:36.666
But Jenna set me up with
one of her friend's fathers,

00:36.667 --> 00:38.281
And we're going
out to dinner after.

00:38.282 --> 00:40.790
Oh, in that case, chips ahoy!

00:40.791 --> 00:43.808
- Bye.
- Have a safe flight.

00:46.721 --> 00:49.132
Oh, what did she forget now?

00:49.133 --> 00:50.570
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:50.571 --> 00:51.807
Uh, is Elka here?

00:51.808 --> 00:53.446
Nick?

00:53.447 --> 00:55.419
Oh, hi.

00:55.420 --> 00:57.258
I believe you left this behind

00:57.259 --> 00:59.597
At the dance, princess.

00:59.598 --> 01:02.772
Well, I had to rush off
when the clock struck 9:00.

01:02.773 --> 01:05.078
Yeah, well...

01:05.080 --> 01:07.485
could we talk?

01:07.486 --> 01:10.292
Oh, sure.
I'll be right out.

01:10.293 --> 01:14.536
Oh, well, it's
a little cold and damp...

01:14.537 --> 01:16.108
What's going on here?

01:16.109 --> 01:18.080
I thought you went to
the dance with Max last night.

01:18.081 --> 01:19.516
I did.

01:19.517 --> 01:21.521
But then Nick
asked me to dance,

01:21.522 --> 01:23.694
And one thing led to another.

01:23.695 --> 01:25.366
You cheated on Max?

01:25.367 --> 01:27.772
Twice.

01:27.773 --> 01:31.883
First a waltz,
and then a polka.

01:31.884 --> 01:33.286
That's it?
You danced?

01:33.287 --> 01:35.424
A polka!

01:35.425 --> 01:39.801
The polish forbidden
dance of love.

01:39.802 --> 01:41.105
I'm gonna go out there

01:41.106 --> 01:43.410
And tell him it was
just one of those things.

01:43.411 --> 01:46.783
No. No swinging.

01:46.784 --> 01:48.650
Oh, you're not a swinger?

01:48.651 --> 01:51.583
I feel guilty enough already.

01:51.584 --> 01:55.281
I had fun last night
but I'm engaged to Max.

01:55.282 --> 01:57.547
Yeah, Max is
my friend too, you know.

01:57.548 --> 02:00.185
But last night,
when we were dancing,

02:00.186 --> 02:03.656
You can't deny
you felt a spark.

02:03.657 --> 02:07.563
Well, orthopedic shoes
on soft carpet...

02:07.564 --> 02:11.702
* I wanna polka,
I wanna polka *

02:11.703 --> 02:13.405
* I wanna polka *

02:13.406 --> 02:16.810
Oh, no!
It's happening again!

02:16.811 --> 02:19.381
Let's get naked.

02:19.382 --> 02:21.050
Oh, stop it.

02:21.051 --> 02:22.786
All right, you win.
I'm gonna go.

02:22.787 --> 02:25.023
But I'm not giving up.

02:25.024 --> 02:28.995
'cause faint heart
never won fair maiden.

02:30.765 --> 02:32.934
Oh, boy!
There's my pacemaker.

02:34.638 --> 02:36.638
Probably telling me
I'm overstimulated.

02:39.477 --> 02:45.097
Sync by MatheuSMP
for www.addic7ed.com

02:48.157 --> 02:49.892
Oh, baby.
Jenna, you were brilliant!

02:49.893 --> 02:51.361
I got applause!

02:51.362 --> 02:52.763
I did, right?

02:52.764 --> 02:54.500
I mean, it wasn't just
you clapping like a maniac?

02:54.501 --> 02:55.768
Hey, I wasn't even clapping.

02:55.769 --> 02:58.238
I was too busy yelling,
"that's my daughter!"

02:58.239 --> 03:00.373
Weird, I thought I
heard some man yelling it too.

03:00.374 --> 03:01.473
I did too.

03:01.474 --> 03:02.975
But dad said
he couldn't make it

03:02.976 --> 03:04.711
Because Kim
had a yoga emergency.

03:04.712 --> 03:06.747
Yeah, well...
Whatever that is.

03:06.748 --> 03:08.082
And frankly, I'm glad.

03:08.083 --> 03:09.350
Because I'm not quite prepared

03:09.351 --> 03:10.552
To run into
your father right now.

03:10.553 --> 03:13.054
Well, then this is awkward.

03:13.055 --> 03:15.658
Hello, Anders.

03:15.659 --> 03:17.227
Thank you.

03:17.228 --> 03:18.762
Who are they for?

03:18.763 --> 03:20.164
There's no name.

03:20.165 --> 03:23.168
Probably from my stalker.

03:24.604 --> 03:29.276
I see he got your
change of address card.

03:29.277 --> 03:32.279
"to the girl with more curves
than the Medina freeway."

03:34.183 --> 03:37.385
They're for me.

03:37.386 --> 03:39.555
From Nick.
He's the poet.

03:39.556 --> 03:41.224
That's poetry?

03:41.225 --> 03:44.227
What does it
say on your flowers?

03:46.397 --> 03:49.901
So Nick is not gonna
take no for an answer, huh?

03:49.902 --> 03:51.703
No.

03:51.704 --> 03:55.407
I've never been
in a triangle before.

03:55.408 --> 03:58.411
You girls are slutty,
what would you do?

04:03.051 --> 04:06.420
Geometry's more
Victoria's specialty.

04:06.421 --> 04:08.256
She's been in
triangles, squares.

04:08.257 --> 04:10.926
Yeah, I was almost
in a hexagon once, but...

04:10.927 --> 04:13.396
At the last minute,
the twins dropped out, so.

04:14.998 --> 04:17.500
- Hi.
- Hey, how did it go?

04:17.500 --> 04:20.737
Well, Jenna rocked,
and Anders and I made out.

04:20.738 --> 04:23.473
See, slutty.

04:23.474 --> 04:24.908
Anders was there?

04:24.909 --> 04:26.476
You kissed Anders?

04:26.477 --> 04:28.778
How did this happen
and where was Kim?

04:28.779 --> 04:31.213
Oh, Kim didn't show,
and my date never happened.

04:31.214 --> 04:33.116
And then Anders and I took
Jenna out to dinner,

04:33.117 --> 04:35.018
And then we met up
for drinks afterwards,

04:35.019 --> 04:37.420
And before knew it
all these little, old feelings

04:37.421 --> 04:39.989
Snuck up on me
and just blindsided me.

04:39.990 --> 04:42.925
Bloody feelings,
spoil everything.

04:42.926 --> 04:44.359
I know this sounds crazy,

04:44.360 --> 04:45.894
But you know
those dumb romantic comedies

04:45.895 --> 04:47.295
That I love so much?

04:47.296 --> 04:48.763
Well, I felt like
I was in the middle of one.

04:48.764 --> 04:50.731
I could just
hear the announcer...

04:50.732 --> 04:52.499
"sometimes the one you're
looking for

04:52.500 --> 04:55.701
Is the one that
was there all along."

04:55.702 --> 04:58.704
"only the biggest hearts
can love more than one."

05:03.209 --> 05:05.477
"she mastered
the craft of acting,

05:05.478 --> 05:08.479
And then
the art of loving."

05:12.050 --> 05:15.418
I'm ashamed to be a woman.

05:15.419 --> 05:17.152
Listen,
fooling around with exes

05:17.153 --> 05:19.587
Is a perfectly natural
and often beautiful part

05:19.588 --> 05:20.655
Of every relationship.

05:20.656 --> 05:23.189
I've slept with all of mine.

05:23.190 --> 05:25.391
- Even the gay one?
- Yes.

05:25.392 --> 05:28.393
He was questioning his
questioning of his sexuality.

05:28.394 --> 05:30.395
But as soon
as we hit the sheets,

05:30.396 --> 05:32.463
We got into a discussion
about thread count,

05:32.464 --> 05:34.764
And well, game over.

05:37.900 --> 05:40.735
Melanie, what have I
told you about romantic movies?

05:40.736 --> 05:42.803
That they're never
as good as their trailers.

05:42.804 --> 05:44.737
Yes, and that they have
nothing to do with real life.

05:44.738 --> 05:48.008
It was one makeout session,
it's over, forget about him.

05:49.344 --> 05:53.083
It's Anders.
"I need to see you again."

05:53.084 --> 05:54.619
Write back "no."

05:54.620 --> 05:57.256
And put one of those frowny
faces with the angry eyes.

05:58.558 --> 06:01.827
I'm texting him back,
"I'm not sure."

06:01.828 --> 06:05.329
I'm gonna have
to think about this.

06:05.330 --> 06:08.832
"while I'm waiting,
can I use your bathroom?"

06:15.138 --> 06:16.639
Anders, this is crazy.

06:16.640 --> 06:18.173
You're engaged to Kim.

06:18.174 --> 06:20.775
Well, truth is, we've
been having some problems.

06:20.776 --> 06:25.079
Ha! Typical.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.181
He breaks up with his bimbo,

06:27.182 --> 06:28.382
Then comes
running back to Melanie.

06:28.383 --> 06:30.417
That's just morally wrong.

06:30.418 --> 06:32.619
I say we kill him.

06:32.620 --> 06:34.520
We can't do anything now.

06:34.521 --> 06:36.622
I mean, we're in
girlfriend purgatory.

06:36.623 --> 06:38.290
If we tell her to dump him

06:38.291 --> 06:39.825
And they end up
getting remarried,

06:39.826 --> 06:41.193
Then we're screwed.

06:41.194 --> 06:42.394
But if we don't say anything

06:42.395 --> 06:43.628
And he ends up breaking
her heart again,

06:43.629 --> 06:44.729
We're screwed.

06:44.730 --> 06:47.531
God.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.265
I miss you, Melanie.
And I miss us.

06:49.266 --> 06:53.801
Well, there are times that,
you know, I miss you too.

06:53.802 --> 06:57.871
But...

06:57.872 --> 06:58.973
Oh, okay.

06:58.974 --> 07:00.408
One dinner
wouldn't hurt, right?

07:00.409 --> 07:03.044
We're screwed.

07:03.045 --> 07:06.080
Screwed, stewed, and tattooed.

07:06.081 --> 07:08.115
That's from a
Tennessee William's play.

07:08.116 --> 07:11.218
I played Esmeralda
in summer stock.

07:11.219 --> 07:12.986
You know, I didn't think

07:12.987 --> 07:15.088
You'd be able to make
this about yourself.

07:15.089 --> 07:17.089
I underestimated you.

07:23.096 --> 07:24.296
Oh, joy.

07:24.297 --> 07:25.897
I just had
the scare of my life.

07:25.898 --> 07:30.234
Did you get dressed
under overhead lighting again?

07:30.235 --> 07:31.703
Yes, and I'm thinking about

07:31.704 --> 07:35.039
Getting the plans out
again for Victoria 2.0.

07:35.040 --> 07:39.776
And I need you to either
talk me into it or out of it.

07:39.777 --> 07:42.778
No sag, visible ribbage, mm.

07:42.779 --> 07:46.115
Hey, people eat in here!

07:46.116 --> 07:48.483
Don't you have
a house of your own?

07:48.484 --> 07:51.520
I need advice.

07:51.521 --> 07:55.322
Both Max and Nick
have invited me

07:55.323 --> 07:57.657
To the senior center
luau tonight.

07:57.658 --> 07:59.292
What time is the luau?

07:59.293 --> 08:01.294
Dinnertime.

08:01.295 --> 08:04.296
4:30.

08:04.297 --> 08:06.264
So go to the luau with one,

08:06.265 --> 08:09.000
And meet the other
after for a nightcap.

08:09.001 --> 08:11.702
Thank you, I'll stay home.

08:11.703 --> 08:14.038
Yeah, but that's
the opposite of what I said.

08:14.039 --> 08:16.306
I know.
I've seen your love life.

08:19.944 --> 08:21.478
Oh, sugar foot!

08:21.479 --> 08:23.145
I always trip on
that gosh darn step.

08:23.146 --> 08:27.215
Ugh, it's like
a Mamet play in here.

08:27.216 --> 08:28.383
Okay, I need your help.

08:28.384 --> 08:29.951
Do you guys think Mirabella's

08:29.952 --> 08:32.053
Is too romantic a place for
a lunch with Anders?

08:32.054 --> 08:34.688
Why is everyone always asking
us for romantic advice?

08:34.688 --> 08:37.557
Yeah, since when did
we become the gay best friend?

08:37.558 --> 08:41.193
You guys gotta help me,
I'm so confused.

08:41.195 --> 08:44.863
On the one hand, it took me
a long time to get over Anders.

08:44.864 --> 08:46.631
Well, then cancel lunch.

08:46.632 --> 08:47.933
But on the other hand,

08:47.934 --> 08:50.068
I've always dreamed
he'd come crawling back.

08:50.069 --> 08:51.402
Then go.

08:51.403 --> 08:53.570
They make a delicious
chocolate mousse for two.

08:53.571 --> 08:54.972
It's probably even better

08:54.973 --> 08:56.973
If you have someone
to share it with.

08:59.143 --> 09:00.677
You're sending mixed messages.

09:00.678 --> 09:02.745
We're just
staying wisely neutral.

09:02.746 --> 09:05.548
Please, just give me
something, anything!

09:05.549 --> 09:07.983
Okay, whenever I'm considering
getting back with an ex,

09:07.984 --> 09:10.418
I always try on
the wedding ring he gave me.

09:10.419 --> 09:12.854
Oh, and then if you slip it on

09:12.855 --> 09:14.555
And it feels right you know?

09:14.556 --> 09:17.224
Actually, I go more
by how many karats

09:17.225 --> 09:19.759
Are bouncing light
back into my eyes.

09:21.562 --> 09:24.997
But I'm sure your way
would work too.

09:24.998 --> 09:28.000
Mel's not ready.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.367
We're here to stall.

09:29.368 --> 09:31.536
Would you like some wine?
Uh, no.

09:31.537 --> 09:33.705
Actually what I could
use is some advice.

09:33.706 --> 09:35.206
Hm, again with the advice.

09:35.207 --> 09:38.009
Oh, just embrace it.

09:38.010 --> 09:39.677
Kim and I are
getting back together,

09:39.678 --> 09:41.044
And I'm flying
back to L.A. Today,

09:41.045 --> 09:43.380
And I don't know
how to tell Melanie.

09:43.381 --> 09:45.815
Ah.

09:46.888 --> 09:50.834
I've never kneed a man
in his manhood before.

09:50.835 --> 09:52.303
I could get used to it.

09:52.304 --> 09:55.771
- Listen...
- What did we say about talking?

09:55.772 --> 09:58.741
Now I have pointy knees too.

09:58.742 --> 10:00.108
Listen, I've
come up with a plan,

10:00.109 --> 10:01.376
But I'm gonna need your help.

10:01.377 --> 10:02.777
I have told you before,

10:02.778 --> 10:06.213
I am far too recognizable
to help you hide a dead body.

10:06.214 --> 10:08.048
What?
Sh!

10:08.049 --> 10:10.650
We are not gonna
let him hurt Melanie again.

10:10.651 --> 10:13.219
Because this time you're
gonna let her break up with you.

10:13.220 --> 10:15.121
No, but she doesn't
wanna break up with him.

10:15.122 --> 10:16.589
She will when
we're done with her.

10:16.590 --> 10:18.257
And you better act sad.

10:18.258 --> 10:20.192
In fact, you better cry.

10:20.193 --> 10:23.194
Or I'll give you
something to cry about.

10:23.195 --> 10:25.063
I'm good.

10:25.064 --> 10:27.331
Just wait for my signal.

10:30.434 --> 10:32.035
Oh, I thought I heard voices,

10:32.036 --> 10:33.502
Is Anders here?
No, it wasn't him.

10:33.503 --> 10:37.306
Child collecting money,
some tragedy.

10:37.307 --> 10:39.508
Oh, God, you actually
put on the ring?

10:39.509 --> 10:41.676
Yeah, I did, and
now I can't get it off.

10:41.677 --> 10:43.044
Maybe it's a sign.

10:43.045 --> 10:44.846
It is.

10:44.847 --> 10:48.982
A sign that Anders is the devil
and should burn in hell.

10:48.983 --> 10:50.685
What happened
to neutral girlfriends?

10:50.686 --> 10:53.453
Well, we decided that
we owe you better than that.

10:53.454 --> 10:57.023
The neutral is the one color
that I cannot play.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.693
You don't need Anders anymore.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.494
The old Melanie
may have needed him,

11:02.495 --> 11:05.830
But the new Melanie is fabulous,
confident, and independent.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.664
- I have changed.
- Yes.

11:07.665 --> 11:09.933
What hasn't changed is Anders.

11:09.934 --> 11:11.201
Now he cheated on you,

11:11.202 --> 11:12.868
And now he's
cheating on Kim with you.

11:12.869 --> 11:16.872
The new Melanie deserves
far better than the old Anders.

11:16.873 --> 11:19.474
- Ooh, that's good.
- Thank you.

11:19.475 --> 11:21.142
I mean she's right.

11:21.143 --> 11:23.211
I didn't think of it that way.

11:23.212 --> 11:25.146
He is still cheating, isn't he?

11:25.147 --> 11:27.881
He hasn't changed at all,
but I have changed.

11:27.882 --> 11:30.683
- We just said that.
- Shut up.

11:30.684 --> 11:32.084
So whenever he gets here...

11:32.085 --> 11:34.986
By the way, what kind
of a guy keeps you waiting?

11:34.987 --> 11:36.855
You know what
you have to do, right?

11:36.856 --> 11:40.124
Yeah, I guess.

11:40.125 --> 11:43.060
I do wanna move forward,
not backward.

11:45.096 --> 11:47.797
Ah! Perfect timing.

11:47.798 --> 11:51.000
Okay, now stay strong
and stick to your guns.

11:51.001 --> 11:52.368
This is gonna be really hard.

11:52.369 --> 11:54.837
Or incredibly easy.

11:54.838 --> 11:58.774
Who can say?
Ah.

11:58.775 --> 12:00.276
- Good-bye, Anders.

12:00.277 --> 12:04.646
I really do think this is
the best for both of us.

12:04.647 --> 12:06.014
Oh...

12:06.015 --> 12:08.649
You really do look
like you're in a lot of pain.

12:08.650 --> 12:11.418
I can honestly say I am.

12:11.419 --> 12:14.120
What's happening now?

12:14.121 --> 12:15.855
She's making some sappy speech

12:15.856 --> 12:18.824
And he's
overplaying like crazy.

12:18.825 --> 12:23.394
It's like one of
those warm moments on <i>glee.</i>

12:23.395 --> 12:24.828
She's coming!

12:24.829 --> 12:27.830
Act natural.

12:33.900 --> 12:35.601
Well, I feel terrible.

12:35.602 --> 12:36.636
He was crushed.

12:36.637 --> 12:38.604
Well, better him than you.

12:38.605 --> 12:40.572
So...
Who's up for mojitos?

12:40.573 --> 12:41.940
Ah.

12:41.941 --> 12:43.307
Guys, I know
you don't like him,

12:43.308 --> 12:46.110
But he was really
sincere this time.

12:46.111 --> 12:47.378
I mean, he cried.

12:47.379 --> 12:48.912
I have never
seen him cry before.

12:48.913 --> 12:51.280
Maybe he has changed.

12:51.281 --> 12:53.215
Maybe he's new Anders,

12:53.216 --> 12:54.883
And new Melanie
just made a big mistake.

12:54.884 --> 12:56.951
Noo.
No, no, no, no mistake.

12:56.952 --> 12:58.852
New Melanie, good.

12:58.853 --> 13:02.121
Maybe this is like those
movies that I love so much.

13:02.122 --> 13:03.590
And this would be the scene

13:03.591 --> 13:04.892
Where I Chase him
to the airport

13:04.893 --> 13:06.127
And I catch him
at the very last minute.

13:06.128 --> 13:07.862
Those movies are stupid.

13:07.863 --> 13:09.462
I mean, by the time you park,
get the shuttle,

13:09.463 --> 13:11.463
All that running...
they're just stupid, okay?

13:13.500 --> 13:14.800
What if he's so happy to see me

13:14.801 --> 13:17.069
He just lifts me up
in his arms.

13:17.070 --> 13:19.104
Oh, it'd be so romantic.

13:19.105 --> 13:20.972
I'm going.

13:20.973 --> 13:22.973
Melanie, stop.

13:24.242 --> 13:27.311
Anders and Kim
got back together.

13:27.312 --> 13:29.148
What?

13:29.149 --> 13:30.449
He didn't know how to tell you,

13:30.450 --> 13:31.917
So we made him promise

13:31.918 --> 13:33.484
To let you break up
with him this time.

13:33.485 --> 13:34.785
So you wouldn't get hurt again.

13:34.786 --> 13:38.088
are you kidding me?

13:38.089 --> 13:39.890
How could you guys
do this to me?

13:39.891 --> 13:43.793
It was all joy's idea.

13:43.794 --> 13:45.194
I just got swept up.

13:45.195 --> 13:50.832
You and I were both innocent
pawns in her little game.

13:50.833 --> 13:52.100
Where are you going?

13:52.101 --> 13:54.502
To catch him before
he gets on that plane!

13:54.503 --> 13:57.838
Should we have gone after her?

13:57.839 --> 14:00.774
No. You know
how these movies work.

14:00.775 --> 14:02.743
The well-meaning best friends
don't show up again

14:02.744 --> 14:04.110
Until she
marries the right guy,

14:04.111 --> 14:06.646
And that's way, way, way
at the end of the thing.

14:06.647 --> 14:08.280
One of us winds up dancing with

14:08.281 --> 14:09.648
The bride's Randy grandfather,

14:09.649 --> 14:12.117
And the other one hooks up
with the handsome cater waiter.

14:12.118 --> 14:15.386
- I call the cater waiter.
- Fine.

14:15.387 --> 14:17.488
Oh, did I mention
that the Randy grandfather

14:17.489 --> 14:21.125
Is a billionaire?

14:21.126 --> 14:22.459
Fine.

14:22.460 --> 14:25.329
Did I mention the cater waiter's
a secret prince?

14:25.330 --> 14:27.364
And did I mention
that the grandfather

14:27.365 --> 14:30.032
Is aging backwards,
like Brad Pitt.

14:38.435 --> 14:40.336
Ooh, Anders!

14:40.337 --> 14:42.738
Anders, Anders!

14:42.739 --> 14:44.840
Ticketed passengers
only, ma'am.

14:44.841 --> 14:46.308
Oh, I know, but that man
in the blue shirt and khakis,

14:46.309 --> 14:47.509
I gotta get him back.

14:47.510 --> 14:49.277
See, I listened
to my girlfriends,

14:49.278 --> 14:50.978
And I shouldn't have. So now
I just have to make it right

14:50.979 --> 14:52.713
Before he gets on
that plane, please.

14:52.714 --> 14:54.681
Wow. This is
just like the last scene

14:54.682 --> 14:56.983
In all of those
romantic comedies.

14:56.984 --> 15:00.586
Yeah, where time is
of the essence.

15:00.587 --> 15:02.087
Jennifer, there's a guy wearing

15:02.088 --> 15:04.089
A blue shirt and khakis
headed your way,

15:04.090 --> 15:06.858
Could you send him back please?

15:06.859 --> 15:08.292
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

15:08.293 --> 15:10.394
I just need one more chance
to tell him how I feel.

15:10.395 --> 15:11.628
So let me guess.

15:11.629 --> 15:13.696
You worked with him,
but you never saw him

15:13.697 --> 15:14.963
As the kind of guy
you would go out with.

15:14.964 --> 15:17.198
Or... or you
were complete opposites,

15:17.199 --> 15:20.235
Until the stuck-up rich guy
you were about to marry...

15:20.236 --> 15:22.438
Melanie...

15:22.439 --> 15:24.006
What's going on?

15:24.007 --> 15:27.709
Anders, joy and Victoria
told me everything.

15:27.710 --> 15:29.678
But before you
get on that airplane

15:29.679 --> 15:31.679
I really need to
tell you how I feel.

15:35.249 --> 15:37.750
You are the biggest [...].

15:37.751 --> 15:40.753
You [...] cheated on me
while we were married,

15:40.754 --> 15:43.854
And then you used me to
cheat on your [...] fiance

15:43.855 --> 15:45.955
Because you don't know
what the [...] you want?

15:45.956 --> 15:48.524
You are a selfish [...]!

15:48.525 --> 15:50.026
Who doesn't think about
anybody else but himself,

15:50.027 --> 15:53.598
So you know what, you
can just go [...] yourself!

15:55.368 --> 15:59.538
Really saw
that going another way.

15:59.539 --> 16:01.539
Ooh, puppy tails!

16:07.947 --> 16:10.413
Oh, hello there, Max.

16:10.414 --> 16:11.648
Is Elka here?

16:11.649 --> 16:15.051
She isn't returning my tweets.

16:15.052 --> 16:16.819
Come in.

16:16.820 --> 16:18.921
Hello,

16:18.922 --> 16:21.990
I'm looking for a little
bit of heaven in a track suit.

16:21.991 --> 16:23.491
Ah.

16:23.492 --> 16:25.727
She should be
around here somewhere.

16:29.464 --> 16:30.731
What are you doing here?

16:30.732 --> 16:32.165
What am I doing here?

16:32.166 --> 16:33.700
I came to see my girl.

16:33.701 --> 16:36.003
Your girl?

16:36.004 --> 16:37.938
Oh, Elka...

16:37.939 --> 16:40.040
You have company.

16:46.946 --> 16:50.948
Nick, Max,
what a colorful surprise.

16:50.949 --> 16:53.050
I told you I
wasn't going to the luau.

16:53.051 --> 16:55.453
You've been cheating on
me with this putz?

16:55.454 --> 17:00.758
Putz? What the heart wants
the heart gets, cue ball.

17:00.759 --> 17:02.392
It was one polka.

17:02.393 --> 17:04.627
It was just physical,
it didn't mean anything.

17:04.628 --> 17:05.829
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:05.829 --> 17:07.696
You have to admit
what we have between us

17:07.698 --> 17:09.698
Is raw and powerful.

17:09.699 --> 17:13.568
I'll introduce you
to raw and powerful.

17:13.569 --> 17:16.037
Put 'em up, if
you can still get them up.

17:16.038 --> 17:17.404
- Really, huh?
- Come on.

17:17.405 --> 17:18.771
When I get through with you,

17:18.772 --> 17:21.208
You're gonna be eating your bran
muffin through a straw.

17:21.209 --> 17:23.010
Please, please...

17:23.011 --> 17:26.244
Fighting isn't gonna
help Elka make up her mind.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.246
Sure it is.

17:33.818 --> 17:34.985
Hey!

17:34.986 --> 17:36.786
What's going on in here?

17:36.787 --> 17:37.987
They're fighting over Elka.

17:37.988 --> 17:39.054
Oh!

17:39.055 --> 17:40.589
So what happened with Anders?

17:40.590 --> 17:41.823
Ah, it was wonderful.

17:41.824 --> 17:44.627
The old Melanie, she was
too nice to let it out.

17:44.628 --> 17:47.662
But the new Melanie,
she let it fly.

17:47.663 --> 17:50.065
I dropped the f-bomb,
like, 15 times.

17:50.066 --> 17:52.000
I could not be more proud.

17:52.001 --> 17:53.901
- So what did you say.
- Oh, you wouldn't believe it.

17:53.902 --> 17:55.302
The security guard was there,

17:57.572 --> 17:59.373
Take the hen party outside,

17:59.374 --> 18:01.742
You're ruining my fight.

18:01.743 --> 18:04.344
Come on, guys.
Mix it up.

18:04.345 --> 18:07.314
No, I don't wanna win
you in a fight.

18:07.315 --> 18:09.082
You know I want you.

18:09.083 --> 18:10.483
If you wanna
be with this shrimp,

18:10.484 --> 18:14.586
So be it.
I just want you to be happy.

18:14.587 --> 18:18.022
Oh, Max, that's so you.

18:18.023 --> 18:19.591
And I love that.

18:19.592 --> 18:22.527
- You do?
- Of course.

18:22.528 --> 18:25.830
That's why I'm your girl,
and always will be.

18:25.831 --> 18:28.899
I'm sorry, Nick.
Yeah, yeah.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.800
That's all right,
I gave it my best shot.

18:30.801 --> 18:34.837
Who can blame you?

18:34.838 --> 18:37.906
You know, there'll
be a whole sea of blue hair

18:37.907 --> 18:39.841
At the luau tonight.

18:39.842 --> 18:42.209
How about you
just go and dive in?

18:44.112 --> 18:46.013
- Uh-oh.

18:46.014 --> 18:49.616
Oh, I'm sorry,
I was just picturing it.

18:49.617 --> 18:51.751
Hi, Evelyn.
Love your shirt.

18:51.752 --> 18:54.486
those coconuts real?

18:57.989 --> 18:59.123
Excuse me.

18:59.124 --> 19:00.858
Can I get
a stick of butter, please?

19:00.859 --> 19:04.493
I know you're upset,
but let's not go crazy.

19:04.494 --> 19:06.562
I'm not gonna eat it,
I can't get this ring off.

19:06.563 --> 19:08.430
Well, I'm glad
you told Anders off.

19:08.431 --> 19:10.298
And I hope this
cures you of your belief

19:10.299 --> 19:12.299
In all that romantic
comedy nonsense.

19:19.306 --> 19:20.640
I hear music swelling.

19:20.641 --> 19:23.943
hi.

19:23.944 --> 19:25.344
Is this your wedding ring?

19:25.345 --> 19:27.078
Well, it was.

19:27.079 --> 19:28.513
So it's mine now?

19:28.514 --> 19:31.249
no, it's complicated.

19:31.250 --> 19:32.783
Well, how
about I buy you a drink

19:32.784 --> 19:33.784
And you explain it to me?

19:33.785 --> 19:35.386
I'd like that.

19:35.387 --> 19:36.887
I'm Melanie.

19:36.888 --> 19:38.888
Nice to meet you, Melanie.

19:39.890 --> 19:42.025
I'm Pete.

19:42.026 --> 19:44.093
Nice to meet you, Pete.

19:47.129 --> 19:48.494
What are you doing?

19:48.495 --> 19:50.129
Hey, she caught one
by accident,

19:50.130 --> 19:52.130
Imagine if we aimed?

19:59.870 --> 20:01.171
Unbelievable.

20:01.172 --> 20:06.343
Shut up, I hear music swelling.

20:06.344 --> 20:08.512
Here's your butter.

20:08.513 --> 20:11.281
Enjoy.

20:13.450 --> 20:16.452
Oh, what the hell.

20:23.321 --> 20:26.390
Desperate much?

20:26.590 --> 20:36.790
