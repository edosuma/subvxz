01:01.061 --> 01:02.061
Fuck it.

01:34.886 --> 01:37.972
I feel like if we could get
charity SoulCycle class

01:38.056 --> 01:41.351
and tie it into your brand,
you're gonna see your brand awareness

01:41.434 --> 01:42.852
go through the roof.

01:42.936 --> 01:46.773
Hi, this is Harper at Moedel PR.
This would just be Instagram alone.

01:46.856 --> 01:48.900
But does Dorinda do anything for you?

01:49.984 --> 01:54.864
We really have to push it out there
that this is a vegan skin care line.

01:54.948 --> 01:58.785
The thing that's great about your product
is that eyelashes can't be too long.

01:58.868 --> 02:02.163
I can't promise which Jonas,
but there will be a Jonas,

02:02.247 --> 02:05.458
and I am not talking Frankie.
No bonus Jonas for you.

02:14.717 --> 02:15.844
Yeah, I'll be right up.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.288
First off, you're probably thinking,
"Why does she have a mask on?"

02:26.312 --> 02:27.730
Well, guess what. People...

02:27.814 --> 02:30.859
It's a little hard to understand you.
Could you take it down for a second?

02:33.319 --> 02:34.737
Just so you know.

02:34.821 --> 02:37.031
There is a stomach virus
that's going around,

02:37.115 --> 02:41.119
and my twins
have very delicate immune systems.

02:41.202 --> 02:44.247
So don't look at me
with your judgy little eyes and dewy skin

02:44.330 --> 02:46.791
and you're like, "Sarah,
why you so weird?" I don't need it.

02:46.875 --> 02:50.336
Okay, 'cause I don't have a gag reflex,
so if I get this bug,

02:50.420 --> 02:51.421
I barf, and then I die.

02:51.504 --> 02:54.340
Well, you have really cute kids
so I understand being protective.

02:54.424 --> 02:55.341
They're literally perfect.

02:55.425 --> 02:58.595
I made this executive decision
very early on in my marriage.

02:58.678 --> 03:01.598
I was like, "Honey,
you're not really father material."

03:01.681 --> 03:03.850
So he got a donor. I got a surrogate.

03:03.933 --> 03:06.144
Anyway, long story,
we have perfect babies.

03:06.227 --> 03:07.937
Oh, wow, that's amazing.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.607
Okay, girl talk city
with croissants is over.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.692
- Can I move on?
- Yeah.

03:12.775 --> 03:14.986
Oh, thanks for the permission.

03:15.278 --> 03:18.573
- Anyway, you've been here a little while.
- Four years.

03:18.656 --> 03:21.409
Right, the reason I asked you in
is because I've decided it's time

03:21.492 --> 03:24.305
to send you on a little business trip
since I never really send you anywhere.

03:24.329 --> 03:27.248
- You did send me to Roanoke, Virginia.
- Yeah, I apologize.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.772
We paid your hospital bill, move on.

03:28.958 --> 03:30.793
- Yeah.
- Anyway, here's the thing...

03:31.169 --> 03:34.547
Disfrutes bottled sangria is looking
to expand their brand

03:34.631 --> 03:38.676
from Spain to the States.
So we are on the verge of closing a deal

03:38.760 --> 03:41.095
to become
their representative PR firm, okay?

03:41.596 --> 03:43.723
- Wow!
- I know, wow. Congratulations,

03:43.806 --> 03:46.392
'cause you're going to go this weekend.
Three days, Barcelona.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.269
I'm going to Spain?

03:48.353 --> 03:50.396
Why do you act
like you've left your apartment?

03:50.480 --> 03:52.607
This is sad.
Can I really trust you?

03:52.690 --> 03:55.276
- Are you ready to go represent us there?
- Of course.

03:55.360 --> 03:59.530
Okay, because they're a bunch
of really horny Spaniards

03:59.614 --> 04:01.032
that like the ladies.

04:01.115 --> 04:04.535
I thought,
"Your energy would be perfect for that."

04:05.745 --> 04:06.955
What do you mean my energy?

04:07.038 --> 04:11.918
You know, "your energy, your drive,
your ambition, your spunk."

04:12.001 --> 04:16.297
- Why are you putting them in quotes?
- Because I mean "vagina, energy."

04:16.380 --> 04:18.257
But I don't sleep with clients.

04:18.341 --> 04:23.137
Congratulations! Oh, my God,
where's your millennial parade?

04:23.221 --> 04:24.973
Jesus Christ, anyway...

04:25.056 --> 04:26.391
Have fun in Barcelona, bye.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.270
Bye.

04:45.285 --> 04:48.288
Just hear me out on this, okay,
we take your biz-class tick,

04:48.371 --> 04:52.292
switch it to three coach, split the diff,
crash at your hotel

04:52.375 --> 04:56.546
and you get to be in Spain
with the two of us, the way God intended.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.172
- Amazing.
- No.

04:58.256 --> 05:01.634
This is literally the first five minutes
of every Locked Up Abroad.

05:01.884 --> 05:04.804
Yes, this is a perfect plan.
This is so great,

05:04.887 --> 05:07.223
and I can totally take the time off
of work.

05:07.348 --> 05:10.068
I mean, the other dentist at my practice
will just cover my patients.

05:10.143 --> 05:13.730
- We have such a nice understanding
- Because you're blackmailing him.

05:14.230 --> 05:16.482
What? No.

05:16.607 --> 05:19.235
That's a no. I'm not blackmailing him.
I already told you,

05:19.319 --> 05:22.572
I just happened to walk into the office
one night when he was huffing nitrous

05:22.655 --> 05:25.241
with our dental assistant Dale,
and I was just like,

05:25.325 --> 05:28.036
"Let me do what I need to do,

05:28.119 --> 05:30.246
and I won't tell your wife and kids
about this."

05:30.788 --> 05:32.081
Blackmail is like...

05:33.124 --> 05:34.584
"Give me back my son!"

05:34.667 --> 05:38.212
- That's kidnapping.
- That's full-on kidnapping.

05:38.296 --> 05:41.924
You're like, "I know something about you.
Do what I want or I'll reveal it."

05:42.008 --> 05:45.595
- That's blackmail.
- No, blackmail is like selling drugs,

05:45.678 --> 05:49.640
but you're, like, covering it up
by having a laundromat,

05:49.724 --> 05:51.952
and you're taking money
for the laundromat, but you're actually

05:51.976 --> 05:53.895
putting it into this drug deal,
and you're like,

05:53.978 --> 05:58.316
"Meet me at the corner of this and this
and if they won't, somebody dies."

05:58.399 --> 06:01.679
Okay, that's a bunch of different crimes,
but what you're doing is still blackmail.

06:02.403 --> 06:04.530
Oh, I am. I'm blackmailing him.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.866
Hmm. I guess I'm a blackmailer.

06:07.408 --> 06:09.168
Anyways, the point is
I can get the time off.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.662
And I'm freelance so I'm totes avail.

06:11.746 --> 06:14.999
Sorry, ladies, this is a work trip.
It's not a vacation.

06:15.083 --> 06:18.336
- You're not coming.
- No, because I heard this thing

06:18.419 --> 06:20.546
- on Politico.
- Yeah, what did you hear?

06:20.630 --> 06:23.800
And they were like, Harper, Nikki and Leah
are going to Spain and I was like,

06:23.883 --> 06:26.928
- "This is on Politico?"
- Oh, my God, then it must be true!

06:27.011 --> 06:30.098
- I read that I'm going to Spain.
- Oh, where did you read that?

06:30.181 --> 06:31.974
Some dumb idiot's diary?

06:32.058 --> 06:36.187
Guys, I don't come to your work
and try and steal nitrous from you

06:36.270 --> 06:39.482
- and clean people's teeth.
- You are welcome to anytime.

06:39.565 --> 06:42.735
This is an important work trip for me.
I could get, like, a promotion.

06:42.819 --> 06:45.321
Spain, just, like, let it wash over you.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.489
No.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.659
Yes!

06:49.742 --> 06:50.576
No.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.245
- Yes.
- No!

06:52.328 --> 06:53.328
Yes!

06:53.371 --> 06:55.581
I'm just gonna buy two tickets,
and we are gonna come.

06:55.665 --> 06:59.335
Yeah!

07:09.011 --> 07:11.013
Mmm!

07:41.961 --> 07:44.589
Okay, guys,
we have to power through this jet lag

07:44.672 --> 07:48.009
and go straight to the beach.
Come on, look at this view.

07:48.092 --> 07:49.945
I wouldn't lie down on that blanket
if I were you.

07:49.969 --> 07:53.848
Hotel rooms are black light nightmares.
There's, like, residual jizz everywhere.

07:53.931 --> 07:56.976
Where isn't the residual jizz,
you know what I mean?

07:57.059 --> 07:59.312
All right, time to get ready
for my first meeting.

08:00.104 --> 08:01.104
- Good luck, Boo.
- Bye.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.151
Excuse me. Where did you get weed?

08:05.693 --> 08:07.111
From the cab driver, duh!

08:07.195 --> 08:09.155
You got weed from the cabbie?

08:09.238 --> 08:11.824
Yeah.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.910
You did a drug deal,
and we didn't even notice?

08:13.993 --> 08:16.662
I work quick, girl,
but you know what I'm most excited about?

08:17.747 --> 08:20.124
Seeing all that old man sausage
in Speedos.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.335
Specifically the old man?

08:22.418 --> 08:24.462
- It's vintage.
- Ew!

08:24.545 --> 08:27.715
I'm like Lewis and Clark,
just forge ahead, baby.

08:27.798 --> 08:29.300
Show me that dick.

08:29.383 --> 08:30.885
You know what I'm excited for?

08:30.968 --> 08:34.263
That we're in a hotel room
and we can do whatever the heck we want.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.350
What was that?

08:37.433 --> 08:40.686
- Oh, shit. Nikki. Oh, my God.
- Nikki, are you okay?

08:41.229 --> 08:42.270
I'm fine.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.649
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I didn't know it was two beds.

08:44.732 --> 08:46.067
You want a smoke?

08:46.859 --> 08:49.237
- This is a cool trip.
- Are you okay?

08:49.320 --> 08:53.074
- Yeah, how's you guys? I'm having fun.
- All right...

08:53.157 --> 08:55.159
I thought you were dead.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.538
Ladies, I will text you after.
Be safe, okay?

08:58.913 --> 09:00.706
Your wish is our command.

09:00.831 --> 09:04.210
- Yes, honey.
- Bye, love you both!

09:04.293 --> 09:06.063
- Love you!
- Come on, let's smoke.

09:06.087 --> 09:08.798
I'm not gonna smoke with you.

09:09.131 --> 09:10.811
Remember the last time I got high
with you?

09:10.883 --> 09:13.302
I embarrassed you
in front of all your drug friends.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.806
Remember? And then I tried
to convince everybody that Shallow Hal

09:16.889 --> 09:21.310
- is the best film of our generation?
- People who smoke aren't drug friends.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.895
They're just friends.

09:22.979 --> 09:26.440
Yours are drug friends.
You know, they're always just like,

09:26.524 --> 09:30.987
"Look at this dank strain of legalize.

09:31.070 --> 09:35.116
Oh, what's this flavor?
It's Apple Blossom. This is so good.

09:35.199 --> 09:36.951
I love this strain of dank."

09:37.034 --> 09:40.288
- Who are these people?
- That's how your drug friends talk.

09:40.371 --> 09:41.848
- They never say "dank."
- Yeah, they do.

09:41.872 --> 09:44.542
- All right, enough of the sass.
- Okay.

09:44.625 --> 09:45.793
One puff.

09:46.752 --> 09:49.213
One puff for the old Nickster.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.548
Nasty Nikki.

09:53.926 --> 09:57.096
Okay,
I've got this black light app downloaded.

09:57.179 --> 09:59.056
Let's test this jizz theory.

10:01.642 --> 10:03.936
- What the fuck?
- Oh, my God!

10:06.564 --> 10:10.109
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

10:10.192 --> 10:11.611
It's everywhere!

10:12.987 --> 10:15.114
How did it get up there?

10:15.197 --> 10:16.907
- Nikki!
- Everywhere!

10:16.991 --> 10:19.243
Do they just jerk off wherever they want?

10:19.327 --> 10:23.331
Who are they? Who are you?!

10:36.802 --> 10:39.847
So many different types
of boobs and nips.

10:39.930 --> 10:42.433
They're like baggy fingerprints.

10:42.516 --> 10:44.685
Bilbo Baggins...

10:44.769 --> 10:46.562
Little Bo Peeps...

10:46.646 --> 10:51.484
Honeydews, Rhi Rhis, Daniel Craigs.

10:51.567 --> 10:54.487
They're all just so beautiful, you know?

10:57.990 --> 11:00.493
- Yo.
- I'm at the beach. Where are you?

11:00.618 --> 11:04.997
- Hi, Khaleesi.
- Hello, hello, hello.

11:05.081 --> 11:07.833
- Hey, girl.
- This is Diego. He works for Disfrute,

11:07.917 --> 11:10.711
and he's so nice that I just told him
that you guys tagged along.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.381
Wow, you're cute.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.091
Oh, thank you very much.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.510
- What?
- Oh, no.

11:17.593 --> 11:20.262
- Whoa.
- Were you wearing sunscreen?

11:20.346 --> 11:22.723
- What am I, burned?
- You're a little red.

11:22.807 --> 11:24.308
No, let's not lie, you're a lot red.

11:24.392 --> 11:27.353
- Red lobster baby.
- Oh, my God.

11:27.728 --> 11:30.272
Am I gonna get sun poisoning?

11:30.856 --> 11:34.110
The Spanish sun is so strong,
but don't worry, it will fade

11:34.193 --> 11:38.030
by this evening,
and you will still look beautiful.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.365
Oh.

11:39.448 --> 11:42.868
Just get yourself,
dip a washcloth with milk,

11:42.952 --> 11:46.038
dripping it on your supple body.

11:46.122 --> 11:48.708
- Thank you...
- Diego.

11:48.791 --> 11:52.336
- I am Nikki-ah.
- Nice to meet you, Nikki-ah.

11:53.003 --> 11:54.755
Nice to meet you, too-ah.

11:56.298 --> 12:00.302
Might I say that you are sunburned
like a lady of Swedish royalty.

12:00.386 --> 12:03.305
Might I say, I am a Jewish person.

12:03.389 --> 12:04.807
The chosen people.

12:04.890 --> 12:07.727
- We are the chosen people.
- Sure.

12:07.810 --> 12:12.022
I'm so sorry I have to leave.
I have my daily workout.

12:16.026 --> 12:18.821
Why don't we meet tonight at the club?
What do you think?

12:18.904 --> 12:21.704
Oh, yes, I would go to the club.
Ladies, do you want to go to the club?

12:21.782 --> 12:23.701
- Sure.
- I'd go to the club.

12:23.784 --> 12:27.246
I love clubbing and drinks
and the music that they play.

12:27.371 --> 12:33.377
Well, we'll have dancing, drinking
and hopefully, something else.

12:34.044 --> 12:36.172
Like making out and doing it.

12:37.089 --> 12:40.259
I would love that inside of my heart.

12:40.801 --> 12:41.844
- See you later.
- Okay.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.764
Preciosa.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.600
- Cuidado.
- I will.

12:47.683 --> 12:48.785
See you at the club.

12:48.809 --> 12:52.229
Flood your basement, he wants you.

12:52.313 --> 12:55.900
Call FEMA. It's an emergency.

12:55.983 --> 12:57.902
All right,
well, let's get ready for the clubs.

12:57.985 --> 13:01.739
- It's two p.m. We've got hours.
- Yeah.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.544
I want you guys
to be excited for the club.

13:03.574 --> 13:06.118
- I'm so excited for the club.
- Yeah, the club!

13:06.202 --> 13:07.536
The club!

13:16.879 --> 13:19.131
Pick a side. Let's go!

13:25.012 --> 13:26.639
This is how it goes.

13:27.014 --> 13:29.350
Three cute ladies coming through!

13:29.475 --> 13:31.852
Sorry, okay, excuse us.

13:31.977 --> 13:34.480
You gotta move. You gotta move.
You gotta move.

13:34.605 --> 13:38.025
- We're three friends. We have to drink.
- Girls night.

13:38.108 --> 13:43.823
Excuse me, sir.
Can we get three shots of tequilas?

13:46.325 --> 13:48.035
Sarah's calling me right now!

13:48.118 --> 13:51.831
No, do not answer. You're in Barcelona.
You could be sleeping.

13:51.914 --> 13:55.835
Yes, actually you really do,
you need your sleep, so...

13:55.918 --> 13:57.169
To may gals!

13:57.253 --> 13:59.046
Aww!

13:59.171 --> 14:00.965
All right, I'm gonna hit "decline."

14:26.073 --> 14:27.783
- I'll show you love.
- Okay.

14:32.413 --> 14:33.289
Okay.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.291
Everybody, everybody, jump!

14:36.166 --> 14:41.881
I'm almost done.
But first, my friend,

14:41.964 --> 14:45.301
Leo West!

15:15.247 --> 15:16.790
What, you're talking to me?

15:18.500 --> 15:21.545
You like my face?
Oh, cool, I like your face.

15:21.629 --> 15:23.088
Two thumbs up for your face.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.467
What, what are you pointing at?
What?

15:27.593 --> 15:28.969
You want me to go up there?

15:29.720 --> 15:30.864
- You guys.
- What?

15:30.888 --> 15:35.643
The DJ, he wants me...
he wants me to go up on the stage.

15:36.435 --> 15:40.272
- Fuck, go get your man.
- He's not my man. He's a man.

15:40.356 --> 15:44.026
- He's not my man.
- Go get your man.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.612
- Okay.
- Go get laid.

15:46.695 --> 15:47.738
Bye.

15:51.241 --> 15:54.411
Okay, excuse me.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

15:54.495 --> 15:57.665
I apologize. Time sensitive.
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

15:57.748 --> 15:58.958
This is the only way.

15:59.041 --> 16:03.003
Hi, the DJ said that he wanted me
to come backstage. So...

16:03.087 --> 16:06.674
- Hello.
- Hi, you know what? You're pretty,

16:06.757 --> 16:10.177
but you're really mean,
and that's gonna serve you well in life.

16:10.260 --> 16:13.013
- She's good.
- Oh, I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.

16:15.391 --> 16:19.937
- Hi. I'm Leo, nice to meet you.
- I'm Harper, nice to meet you.

16:20.020 --> 16:25.025
I must say, you're very talented.
I really enjoyed your music.

16:25.109 --> 16:26.151
I really enjoyed it.

16:26.235 --> 16:27.987
I've not started yet.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.197
- What?
- But I'll tell the other DJ

16:30.280 --> 16:32.408
how much you enjoyed her music.

16:32.491 --> 16:35.244
Oh, that girl.
You seem much more talented.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.621
- I do?
- Yeah, like a refinement to you.

16:37.705 --> 16:41.667
- You can tell that from me now?
- You've got more of a...

16:43.669 --> 16:45.869
What I meant to say was
you're probably better than her.

16:46.046 --> 16:48.132
- Thanks for that.
- Yeah. Or who knows.

16:48.215 --> 16:52.052
Maybe you're a sociopath
or a garden variety d-bag for all I know.

16:52.136 --> 16:56.140
Okay, or I could just be a nice guy
that wanted to tell you something.

16:56.223 --> 16:58.726
- What did you want to tell me?
- Don't freak out about it.

17:00.060 --> 17:02.813
Do you mind if I just do that?

17:02.896 --> 17:07.067
I just wanted to show you that you've got
a massive dick on your face.

17:07.151 --> 17:09.778
- What do you mean?
- You've got a massive dick on your face.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.364
Oh, my God.
I have a fucking dick on my face!

17:16.535 --> 17:18.078
What the fuck?!

17:18.162 --> 17:19.763
You didn't know
you had a dick on your face,

17:19.788 --> 17:22.165
and I wanted to help you
and take it off,

17:22.249 --> 17:25.502
- which is what I'm going to do right now.
- Well, thank you, I guess,

17:25.586 --> 17:29.006
so you're preserving the teaspoon
of dignity that I have left.

17:29.089 --> 17:31.925
- You are very, very welcome.
- I mean, what's the point?

17:32.009 --> 17:35.971
Everyone already saw
my big glowing dick face.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.474
You know, I think it's a dying art form,
the old cock face.

17:38.557 --> 17:42.186
You do? Well, in that case you should know
that that was nothing for me.

17:42.269 --> 17:43.353
That was like a six.

17:43.437 --> 17:46.440
- All right, steady on.
- The balls on the last one

17:46.523 --> 17:48.442
would have really knocked your socks off.

17:48.525 --> 17:52.196
Not that I...
Not a real one. Like a...

17:53.238 --> 17:56.200
- You know what I'm saying.
- I know what you're saying.

18:01.205 --> 18:04.458
Are you staying out for one?

18:04.541 --> 18:08.629
- I mean, maybe, it depends.
- Depends if the music's good or not?

18:08.712 --> 18:13.759
It's probably gonna be shit, right?
I don't like EMD music.

18:15.969 --> 18:22.810
In case the music isn't that bad
and you do stay 'round,

18:24.770 --> 18:25.813
then give me a call.

18:25.896 --> 18:26.772
Oh.

18:26.897 --> 18:29.691
And if not, I have a picture of you
with a dick on your face,

18:29.775 --> 18:34.863
and that's photo blackmail,
so you have to see me again to delete it.

18:34.947 --> 18:39.284
Right, well, break a leg.
Do you say that for DJs?

18:39.368 --> 18:41.286
You can say whatever you fucking like.

18:41.370 --> 18:44.206
All right, have a great fucking set, man.

18:44.289 --> 18:47.126
All right, I will have a fucking great set
and you have a...

18:49.586 --> 18:52.464
- No, one saw that.
- Okay.

18:57.469 --> 19:01.890
Oh! I think I'm gonna throw up.

20:58.465 --> 21:01.385
We've been looking for you.
Where have you been?

21:01.468 --> 21:04.054
We're VIP's now baby. Hi!

21:04.137 --> 21:10.227
Oh, hi! Harper, we're dancing on the table
and stuff. I totally get it now.

21:10.310 --> 21:12.646
I mean, I feel like I'm definitely
gonna hurt myself,

21:12.729 --> 21:16.191
- but this is fun, right?
- Wait, why are we at this table?

21:16.275 --> 21:20.570
Well, Hernando saw my sick ass dance moves
and invited us over.

21:20.654 --> 21:21.530
Hola,

21:21.613 --> 21:25.033
I'm Hernando Montavia
Portavano García Castillo.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.828
- Oh, and I'm Harper.
- Nice to meet you.

21:27.911 --> 21:29.454
- You, too.
- Okay, thank you, sir.

21:29.538 --> 21:32.374
- So what happened?
- It was amazing!

21:32.457 --> 21:36.044
We totally had a moment,
although our moment did happen

21:36.128 --> 21:38.714
because I had a giant glowing dick
on my face, so that was...

21:38.797 --> 21:40.173
Wait, what?

21:40.257 --> 21:43.969
Some dude was like,
"Whoa, I show you love,"

21:44.052 --> 21:46.555
and he drew a dick on my face.

21:46.638 --> 21:49.391
Listen,
the DJ is a very good friend of mine.

21:49.725 --> 21:52.519
- Really?
- Yes, come to my house.

21:52.602 --> 21:55.355
- He will be there.
- I'm just like...

21:56.606 --> 21:59.943
I haven't really slept with anyone
in a while, so I'm a little nervous.

22:00.027 --> 22:02.362
You don't tell him that.
That's an over share.

22:02.446 --> 22:05.574
- I have a really difficult boss.
- Also an over share.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.075
Stop telling him personal things.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.828
I've not been feeling very good
about myself lately.

22:10.620 --> 22:12.581
- Will you learn to be cool.
- Can we go?

22:12.664 --> 22:14.791
We just have to wait for Diego
to get here first.

22:14.875 --> 22:18.587
Oh, he texted me. He said, he doesn't know
when he's gonna get here.

22:18.670 --> 22:23.508
He's very sorry,
especially to his mermaid siren Nikita.

22:23.592 --> 22:27.137
Okay, I guess I'm a mermaid siren.

22:27.220 --> 22:31.683
Just tell him to go to Hernando's,
then we can hook up there. Huh!

22:31.767 --> 22:33.769
Don't do that. Don't do that.
Don't do that.

22:38.774 --> 22:40.609
If Hernando thinks
by sending this car for us

22:40.692 --> 22:44.363
one of us is gonna sleep with him,
he has got another thought coming.

22:44.446 --> 22:47.324
Okay, you know what, maybe I will.

22:47.407 --> 22:49.534
- Really?
- Older sausage, baby.

22:49.618 --> 22:52.454
- Eww.
- All right. Look at this house.

22:57.459 --> 23:01.254
Guys, I'm definitely doing something
fucked up tonight.

23:01.338 --> 23:04.132
I cannot wait.

23:04.257 --> 23:06.927
This is like the Eyes Wide Shut house.

23:07.511 --> 23:09.930
If I were you, I'd keep my eyes wide open.

23:18.021 --> 23:20.982
- I'm down for this, for sure.
- Cool.

23:22.526 --> 23:25.153
Why not? That's the better
question for most of us.

23:25.237 --> 23:28.490
Oh, my lovelies, so glad you made it.

23:28.573 --> 23:30.158
Thank you so much for having us.

23:30.242 --> 23:34.621
Please, explore,
help yourself with food, drinks, smiles

23:34.704 --> 23:37.457
- and eye opening sexual experiences.
- Hmm.

23:39.084 --> 23:45.465
Okay, well, I got to pee
and go find a fucking problem, lick.

23:45.549 --> 23:47.342
- Lick.
- Have a good pee.

23:49.177 --> 23:51.263
Is Leo West here yet?

23:52.389 --> 23:54.599
Relax, enjoy your party.

23:55.308 --> 23:58.854
I will, yes. But is that a maybe?

24:04.276 --> 24:05.503
- Should we go find the food?
- Yes.

24:05.527 --> 24:06.527
Okay.

24:08.029 --> 24:10.842
I should call Leo, right, or text him?
He's probably wondering where I am.

24:10.866 --> 24:12.427
What if he's in the club looking for me?

24:12.451 --> 24:14.178
You know,
I should let him know that I'm here,

24:14.202 --> 24:16.002
'Cause I feel like he was really
into my vibe.

24:16.079 --> 24:17.765
And I don't think he wants
to play games any more.

24:17.789 --> 24:21.626
No, everybody loves games.
He's going to show, okay,

24:21.710 --> 24:24.337
and when he gets here,
you should just be cool.

24:24.421 --> 24:28.216
You know, just be like, "Oh, my goodness,
you're at Hernando's, too?

24:28.300 --> 24:30.760
That's such a coinky-dink.
Hernando's my uncle,

24:30.844 --> 24:35.390
and we love to go to Lake Cuomo
and hang with all the celebrities

24:35.474 --> 24:37.476
- on a yacht."
- What?

24:37.559 --> 24:40.020
A yacht, is that not how you say it?

24:40.103 --> 24:44.232
Yacht. Boat, yacht, ship.
What am I doing wrong?

24:44.316 --> 24:45.734
Nothing. It's perfect.

24:45.817 --> 24:46.817
All right.

24:47.777 --> 24:51.072
You know what? I can't pretend
to be cool with this anymore.

24:51.156 --> 24:53.867
It's kind of disgusting.
We're eating off of a person's body.

24:53.950 --> 24:55.202
It can't be sanitary.

24:55.285 --> 24:56.745
She can hear you.

24:57.412 --> 25:01.333
By the way, ma'am, I did not mean
to imply that you are disgusting.

25:01.416 --> 25:02.977
It's just that I don't know you,
so, I probably shouldn't

25:03.001 --> 25:04.020
be eating out of your crotch.

25:04.044 --> 25:07.214
She's my best friend,
and I would still not be like,

25:07.297 --> 25:10.300
"Guess what. I'm going to eat hummus out
of your crotch tonight."

25:10.383 --> 25:15.096
You don't put food on your crotch,
unless you've got a yeast infection

25:15.180 --> 25:17.891
- and you put plain full-fat yogurt.
- What?

25:18.767 --> 25:21.353
- Hola chicas.
- Muy bien y usted?

25:21.436 --> 25:23.396
- Spanish.
- Oh, drugs.

25:23.480 --> 25:28.193
Just come straight in with the coke.
I blew some rails earlier, so I'm good.

25:28.276 --> 25:29.962
She's full up.
We're both full up on cocaine.

25:29.986 --> 25:32.340
How about one of these? It is
for children that are hyperactive,

25:32.364 --> 25:35.825
- but for other people is really good.
- Oh, it's Adderall.

25:35.909 --> 25:38.828
- Yeah, let me grab one.
- What are you doing?

25:38.912 --> 25:40.664
It's a regulated drug.

25:40.747 --> 25:42.999
Yeah, that means
they're regulating your access to it.

25:43.083 --> 25:46.419
Let me have one more actually,
because it's regulated for children,

25:46.503 --> 25:47.629
and I'm an adult.

25:47.754 --> 25:49.965
They're trying
to regulate people's consumption of it,

25:50.048 --> 25:53.468
- not just the age of the people taking it.
- That is not what that means.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.655
I'm a dentist. I know that that is not
what that means.

25:55.679 --> 25:58.223
It means it's regulated
for the consumer public.

25:58.306 --> 26:00.559
- Sí. Sí. Disfrutala.
- Okay.

26:00.642 --> 26:02.435
- Disfrutala.
- And to you as well.

26:02.519 --> 26:05.146
- You know what? Let's live, let's party.
- All right.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.439
I'm gonna call Diego.

26:06.815 --> 26:09.776
So can you GTD?

26:09.859 --> 26:11.619
- What does that mean?
- Give me them digits.

26:11.653 --> 26:14.239
Okay, that's not a thing that people say.

26:14.906 --> 26:17.993
I'm literally starting it,
and I would love your support.

26:18.076 --> 26:21.496
I'll Airdrop it to you. There you go.

26:22.080 --> 26:24.457
Phones are crazy, right?
Yeah, all the stuff.

26:24.541 --> 26:27.460
- Thank you. Oop. Shouldn't touch you.
- Mnh-mnh.

26:27.544 --> 26:30.589
Let's divide and conquer.
I'm gonna go make a phone call

26:30.672 --> 26:34.134
that I'm going to regret.
Find your own fun, bitch.

26:38.471 --> 26:39.681
She's a pill, huh?

26:44.269 --> 26:46.605
Oh, shit. Sorry.

26:49.399 --> 26:51.067
You like that show?

26:51.151 --> 26:54.404
Mm-hmm. You can stop peeing.

26:54.487 --> 26:55.864
Okay.

26:58.533 --> 27:00.827
Oh, my God. Por la amor de ellos.

27:02.704 --> 27:04.706
I've got to show you the jacuzzi.

27:05.332 --> 27:07.709
Well, I want to see la jacuzzi.

27:07.792 --> 27:09.628
Okay.

27:15.175 --> 27:16.343
Stay sweet.

27:30.690 --> 27:31.691
Yes!

27:34.027 --> 27:35.820
You hit the jackpot, Nicole.

28:04.683 --> 28:05.809
Hmm.

28:07.185 --> 28:08.770
Oh, hi.

28:14.150 --> 28:15.819
You look great. You look great.

28:25.745 --> 28:26.745
Hmm.

28:28.206 --> 28:29.225
Are you enjoying the party?

28:29.249 --> 28:33.545
Oh. Yeah, yeah, it's nuts.

28:33.628 --> 28:37.882
Did you try the drugs
or the open sexual practices

28:37.966 --> 28:39.801
or maybe just a swim?

28:41.344 --> 28:44.848
I had the sushi,
which I kind of feel covers all three.

28:45.598 --> 28:46.766
You're funny.

28:47.475 --> 28:50.478
- Does that work for you?
- Not really, no.

28:50.562 --> 28:51.562
Oh.

28:54.274 --> 28:58.611
So, do you know if
Leo West is gonna show?

28:58.695 --> 29:04.534
Harper, you have to work as hard
to find yourself as you work to find him.

29:04.993 --> 29:09.330
Now, join me in the den
for a spiritual connection.

29:10.165 --> 29:11.165
Cool.

29:19.466 --> 29:21.468
- What?
- Your beauty makes me crazy.

29:21.968 --> 29:26.097
Crazy, like I murder people with a knife.

29:26.181 --> 29:27.891
You're so beautiful in the face.

29:27.974 --> 29:30.727
I'm gonna ignore it.
I'm gonna ignore it.

29:31.978 --> 29:35.231
Hey, Diego, I know it's late,
but I just thought, "Why not, right?"

29:35.690 --> 29:39.861
Let's just hang, you know,
of course assuming that you are awake.

29:39.944 --> 29:43.072
Which you may very well be asleep
and if so, I'm sorry that I woke you up.

29:43.573 --> 29:45.950
Actually, that doesn't make sense
you should be here, right?

29:46.409 --> 29:49.249
Sorry, I know that it's a voice mail,
and you can't answer me right now.

29:49.704 --> 29:53.958
Whoa! It's 4:30 in the morning, hon.

29:54.042 --> 29:56.085
Well, I am on a lot of drugs
and alcohol right now,

29:56.169 --> 29:58.004
so that does explain some of it.

29:58.087 --> 30:02.217
By the way, this is Nikki.
I don't know if I said that to you yet.

30:02.300 --> 30:06.721
Nikki is Harper's friends,
so you know Harpers from works.

30:07.263 --> 30:09.015
I think...

30:09.098 --> 30:12.185
I think there are some feelings, okay,

30:12.268 --> 30:14.896
and not quite kosher.

30:14.979 --> 30:17.649
Sorry you probably don't even know
what kosher means.

30:17.732 --> 30:23.196
Well, I'm gonna teach you. Don't worry,
I'm not going to, like, circumcise you.

30:23.279 --> 30:26.991
What? No, but honestly, I love to flirt.

30:27.617 --> 30:31.204
Thank you so much, and I look forward
to speaking with you. Bye-bye.

30:31.996 --> 30:36.626
Okay, wow,
you're fucking nailing him, bitch.

30:36.709 --> 30:40.421
Whoo! Good job!
I'm gonna see how fast I can go.

30:40.547 --> 30:42.549
Take this, you little machine.

31:04.988 --> 31:07.407
What?

31:07.866 --> 31:11.244
- Oh, shit! Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- Run!

31:19.544 --> 31:23.214
I'm going to fucking die tonight,
in some stranger's fucking shitty boxers.

31:23.840 --> 31:26.050
To the left, to the left, there you go.

31:26.843 --> 31:28.094
Puta!

31:28.428 --> 31:32.015
Hey, Harp, we have to get out of here now.
Some shit went down

31:32.098 --> 31:35.810
and it's mostly my fault, but you know,
life, we got to get the fuck out of here.

31:35.894 --> 31:38.313
- No, let's stay.
- Harper, listen to me!

31:38.396 --> 31:42.025
Someone's gonna come in here
and fuck us up with a goddamn knife.

31:42.108 --> 31:45.445
- On my back!
- I smoked hash, and it was really nice,

31:45.528 --> 31:47.447
- and Nikki took some hash.
- Great story.

31:47.614 --> 31:50.867
So it was really fun and okay.

31:51.034 --> 31:54.037
- Listen to me, don't move, okay?
- Okay.

31:56.331 --> 31:57.331
That was fun.

31:57.999 --> 32:00.001
How many languages
does your boyfriend talk?

32:00.668 --> 32:03.630
My boyfriend talks more than one,
at least.

32:03.963 --> 32:05.298
English and Spanish...

32:06.758 --> 32:09.469
- Dude, Nikki, wake up, we gotta go now!
- What's happening?

32:09.552 --> 32:12.472
This married guy ate me out,
and his wife caught us. We got to go.

32:12.555 --> 32:15.475
- We're gonna get stabbed.
- Whoa, I burnt 4,000 calories!

32:15.558 --> 32:18.853
- I don't care. Grab your shit, let's go!
- Do you have a coin?

32:18.937 --> 32:22.482
- Harper! Go, go, go!
- I really wanted Leo to see me right now

32:22.607 --> 32:25.234
'cause I'm really cool and sexy,
and I think he would be in to me.

32:55.098 --> 32:58.851
Gracias, thank you so much.
Oh, gosh.

32:59.394 --> 33:01.437
We did it, ladies.

33:05.274 --> 33:06.943
Deal with that in a second.

33:07.235 --> 33:10.738
What are you looking at? Oh, the light.
Yeah, there's more light this way.

33:11.197 --> 33:13.616
Towards our hotel, okay.

33:14.075 --> 33:16.494
No, no, no, no time for stetchies.

33:16.577 --> 33:20.957
- No, I have to be even.
- I understand, but I'm tired.

33:21.290 --> 33:26.504
Let's go, get some sleep
and rest our weary heads.

33:26.587 --> 33:30.216
- I gotta shit. I gotta shit.
- No, no, no!

33:30.299 --> 33:33.636
- I'm not strong.
- There we go. There we go.

33:33.720 --> 33:36.556
- Just hold it, just hold it.
- I've got to push it back in.

33:37.140 --> 33:39.600
Nikki, honey. How are you doing?

33:39.684 --> 33:42.061
- I'm good, how are you?
- Good.

33:42.437 --> 33:45.398
- Want to get on my other side?
- Oh, I'm so hungry.

33:45.523 --> 33:49.944
- Are you guys hungry?
- Yes. No, no, no. Okay, okay.

33:50.194 --> 33:55.575
Hey, dudes. Do y'all know
where's a good pizza joint around here?

33:56.451 --> 33:59.537
- Pizza?
- No, you guys are beautiful.

33:59.620 --> 34:01.873
Do you have the menu for room service?

34:01.956 --> 34:04.083
They don't.
They're not in our hotel. We're outside.

34:04.208 --> 34:07.378
- Those look good, empanadas.
- Yeah.

34:07.462 --> 34:12.007
"Sí, y helado de chocolate."

34:12.091 --> 34:15.762
Then just a big pile of corn on a plate
with a little bit of ranch on top.

34:15.844 --> 34:19.389
- Yeah, a lot of bit of ranch.
- And then, all these muffins.

34:19.474 --> 34:21.016
- With a side of ranch.
- Yeah.

34:23.393 --> 34:25.146
I can't believe we left the club.

34:26.022 --> 34:28.649
If we'd stayed,
I would be with him right now.

34:28.733 --> 34:31.277
We had, like, a real connection.

34:31.694 --> 34:33.905
You guys didn't see it. There were sparks.

34:35.072 --> 34:36.657
I have to work anyway.

34:36.991 --> 34:40.078
- My boss keeps texting me.
- Can I see your phone?

34:40.161 --> 34:43.956
Yes, I got, like, ten text messages
and four voice mails.

34:44.040 --> 34:48.127
You guys, I'm so hungry, I feel like
there's a monster inside of me.

34:48.210 --> 34:51.714
And she's like,
"Give me all the foods and snacks

34:51.797 --> 34:54.634
and also don't forget the desserts, okay?"

34:54.759 --> 34:57.345
Check this out, bitch!

34:57.428 --> 35:02.809
You're man Leo West is in Ibiza tonight.
This is fucking fate.

35:02.892 --> 35:05.603
- Yes, yes, yes!
- Okay, stop that. Please stop.

35:05.686 --> 35:08.564
I can't just fly to Ibiza,
I mean that's crazy.

35:08.648 --> 35:10.817
Why? It's, like, so close.

35:10.900 --> 35:15.196
Because I have a very important meeting
here tomorrow night, and if I miss it,

35:15.279 --> 35:18.074
- I'm gonna get fired.
- Okay, here's the T.

35:18.157 --> 35:23.079
Some people land on the moon.
Others cure diseases.

35:23.162 --> 35:27.083
You smash this DJ.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.921
Yeah, actually that was really impressive
and a good point.

35:32.505 --> 35:35.508
No, I gotta stay here
and keep my job.

35:35.591 --> 35:37.635
Harper, what do you want to do?

35:42.515 --> 35:44.392
I want to go to Ibiza.

35:44.475 --> 35:47.311
- Then we're going to Ibiza.
- But I can't go to Ibiza.

35:47.395 --> 35:51.190
Yes, you can. This is destiny.
We're going to Ibiza.

35:51.274 --> 35:53.359
You know what happens when destiny calls.

35:54.569 --> 35:58.114
- You accept.
- In the words of Destiny's Child...

35:58.823 --> 36:00.908
Say my name.

36:00.992 --> 36:04.287
- Guys, he's so hot.
- He's so hot!

36:04.370 --> 36:06.664
- I can't go!
- You don't have to make the decision

36:06.747 --> 36:07.999
'cause we're gonna force you.

36:11.544 --> 36:14.881
Harper!

36:14.964 --> 36:18.509
Harper!

36:18.593 --> 36:21.470
Harper! Harper! Harper!

36:21.596 --> 36:26.267
Harper! Harper! Harper! Harper!

36:26.350 --> 36:27.768
Yay!

36:27.852 --> 36:31.189
Guys, this is our bestest friend Harper.

36:31.272 --> 36:34.275
- Hi, Harper.
- And we are going to Ibiza.

36:34.358 --> 36:37.570
So we can track down this DJ
that she's gonna get dirty,

36:37.653 --> 36:41.824
nasty, sexy with.

36:41.908 --> 36:44.952
You're a dirty little minx,
just like your friend Leah.

36:45.077 --> 36:47.788
Well, trying it out.
It's a new look for me.

36:47.872 --> 36:48.956
It's bloody brilliant.

36:49.040 --> 36:52.710
My grandfather always said,
"Youth is wasted on the young."

36:52.793 --> 36:53.961
You, my new friend,

36:54.045 --> 36:57.423
- are not wasting it.
- Yeah, actually, I once went to Norway

36:57.506 --> 37:00.968
to follow a girl I was in love with.
Turned out she was stealing my identity.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.262
- Tried to kill him.
- She did try to kill me.

37:03.387 --> 37:07.183
I got a dynamite anecdote out of that one.
So this could really bear fruit.

37:07.266 --> 37:08.184
Yeah, okay.

37:08.267 --> 37:12.897
I'm the shot police. It's against the law
to be in this area without a shot.

37:12.980 --> 37:15.691
All right.

37:18.361 --> 37:20.756
- I like this girl, she's cool.
- That's my girl.

37:20.780 --> 37:23.699
Don't worry, you're gonna be riding
that DJ's filthy dick in no time.

37:23.783 --> 37:26.077
Oh, boy, I hope it's not too filthy.

37:26.160 --> 37:29.705
Well, he's a professional musician,
so it's probably hanging by a thread.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.751
This is all theoretical.
I probably won't find him.

37:33.834 --> 37:36.254
We'll never have sex.
He doesn't have any interest in me.

37:36.337 --> 37:38.547
- We just met once.
- Of course he does.

37:38.631 --> 37:41.342
You've gotta trust these guys.
They're soccer players.

37:41.425 --> 37:46.806
Well, not soccer, football.
Football is soccer, in England.

37:46.889 --> 37:48.449
- Everywhere.
- Well, it's just for fun.

37:48.516 --> 37:52.645
- We're not, like, professional...
- We're actually male model scientists.

37:52.728 --> 37:54.063
- Oh.
- Professionally.

37:54.146 --> 37:57.817
Well, I'm a lawyer,
actually professionally, for real.

37:57.900 --> 37:59.819
- In true life.
- Cool.

37:59.902 --> 38:01.505
James, stop telling the truth.
What's wrong with you?

38:01.529 --> 38:05.491
'Cause we don't want to start off
a new relationship on a lie.

38:05.574 --> 38:07.743
- Relationship?
- Yeah, well, not like,

38:07.827 --> 38:10.746
we're gonna hold hands
and go to the cinema,

38:10.830 --> 38:13.666
but more of a relationship with you
and that lady over there.

38:13.749 --> 38:15.501
Or any inanimate object.

38:15.584 --> 38:18.045
Yeah, like a bloody belt.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.715
We have much more of a relationship
than you have with a belt.

38:20.798 --> 38:22.838
Yes, although,
that has been wrapped round my waist.

38:22.925 --> 38:25.195
- That's a bit aggressive.
- No, too far. Okay, great. Well...

38:25.219 --> 38:29.557
- Guys, Ibiza!
- Ibiza!

38:29.682 --> 38:32.560
- Olly, olly, olly!
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

39:13.976 --> 39:17.563
Sir, can you please take us to the sunset
and then straight to the DJ dick?

39:17.646 --> 39:19.857
Whoo!

39:43.714 --> 39:45.925
I can't believe we're fucking here.

39:46.008 --> 39:48.010
- I know.
- It's bonkers.

39:48.427 --> 39:50.304
We're in fucking Ibiza, man!

39:52.932 --> 39:56.435
I have to say to say,
if this is as good as this trip gets,

39:56.560 --> 39:58.562
- this is pretty good.
- Yeah.

40:00.898 --> 40:04.235
And none of us are taking photos,
we're so in the moment.

40:23.087 --> 40:25.172
You guys, it's been, like, over an hour.

40:25.256 --> 40:29.051
Hola, yes, yes, yes.
Yo necesito una taxi.

40:29.385 --> 40:34.140
Mi y mis hermanas estamos el norte playa,
Puesta del Sol.

40:35.975 --> 40:36.975
Hola.

40:37.977 --> 40:40.146
- Hola!
- Okay.

40:40.229 --> 40:42.231
What the fuck? They hung up again!

40:42.314 --> 40:45.401
So we're just stuck here
in the middle of nowhere.

40:45.484 --> 40:48.988
I have to call Cruela DeCunt soon.
You know how bad I am at lying.

40:49.071 --> 40:51.407
And then what happens
if we actually do get to Flow?

40:51.490 --> 40:52.968
Have you thought about
how we're gonna get in?

40:52.992 --> 40:56.620
Don't we have to be like hot or rich
or bribe the door guy?

40:56.704 --> 40:58.706
- A cab, a cab!
- Oh, fuck, a cab!

40:58.789 --> 41:03.043
Oh, God! Oh, God, hello!
Hello. Sorry to interrupt, sir.

41:03.169 --> 41:06.172
Could you please, please,
like pretty please, we'll pay you extra,

41:06.255 --> 41:09.758
drive us to the other side of the island
to Flow? It's a really big club.

41:09.842 --> 41:13.929
Of course I can take you, come on.
Por favor, jump in.

41:14.889 --> 41:18.392
Okay, you're all in?
Welcome to my taxi!

41:18.476 --> 41:20.603
- Yes!
- Name is Lazer.

41:20.686 --> 41:22.229
Lazer!

41:22.396 --> 41:25.357
Encantado, to Flow. To Flow, we go.

41:45.836 --> 41:49.006
- Hey, Lazer, where are we?
- We're almost at my house.

41:49.632 --> 41:53.677
What? No, you've got to take us to town
so we can go to Flow.

41:53.761 --> 41:55.513
I'm just gonna feed my dog first.

41:55.596 --> 41:59.266
- Then I'll take you into town, okay?
- That sounds sketchy as fuck.

41:59.642 --> 42:05.231
Hey, you guys,
I'm trained in self-defense, just in case.

42:06.774 --> 42:09.443
I can kill a man, like this.

42:11.445 --> 42:14.031
Bless you.

42:52.570 --> 42:53.570
Wow.

42:53.946 --> 42:57.074
A masterpiece.
That was great. That was great.

42:57.157 --> 42:59.077
- Thank you.
- Maybe we should get going?

42:59.201 --> 43:01.453
Tengo el bebido perfecto
para esta situación.

43:01.537 --> 43:02.621
Be right back.

43:03.289 --> 43:06.750
If this was New York and someone was like
"Before I take you to West Ville,

43:06.834 --> 43:08.594
I'm going to drive you
to my house in Yonkers

43:08.627 --> 43:10.897
and then go all the way downtown,"
you'd be like, "What the fuck?!"

43:10.921 --> 43:13.465
Yeah, but everybody
in New York is like...

43:13.549 --> 43:17.011
Whereas everybody in Ibiza is, like, cool.

43:17.094 --> 43:19.930
Yeah, girl,
this place is built on rose quartz.

43:20.014 --> 43:23.392
- So just enjoy the chill energy,
- Yes.

43:23.475 --> 43:26.395
have fun, forget plans.

43:26.478 --> 43:29.064
Ahora sí.

43:29.940 --> 43:32.026
So, you want to go to Flow?

43:32.943 --> 43:35.446
I can drive you there,
but you won't get in.

43:36.238 --> 43:40.909
However, I'll take you to my niece.
She's a dancer there, so I'll call her,

43:40.993 --> 43:42.113
and she'll take care of you.

43:42.328 --> 43:44.038
For real, your niece can get us in?

43:44.121 --> 43:47.458
You know what else?
I have the limo I drive on weekends.

43:47.541 --> 43:51.462
I'll take you in that
for a special treat. Okay.

43:51.545 --> 43:54.381
You see, Ibiza loves you.
Come on, cheer up! Cheer up!

43:54.465 --> 43:55.585
Raise your glasses!

44:12.274 --> 44:15.277
Hi!

44:15.402 --> 44:17.237
Can you open the moon roof?

44:17.321 --> 44:18.947
Los pájaros al tiene visa.

44:19.031 --> 44:21.033
I'm doing it!

44:24.536 --> 44:28.874
I am a total cliche right now,
and I don't fucking care!

44:29.958 --> 44:31.251
All right, why not?

44:35.714 --> 44:37.966
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

44:38.676 --> 44:40.678
- Shit, you guys,
- What?

44:40.928 --> 44:44.431
A bird just shit in my mouth.

44:44.556 --> 44:45.766
It's in my mouth.

44:45.849 --> 44:47.685
It's in my fucking mouth.

44:48.602 --> 44:52.564
Oh, my God! Shit! Oh, my God!
Lazer, can I have a towel?

44:52.648 --> 44:55.651
Yeah, of course.

44:55.734 --> 44:56.819
It's in my mouth!

44:56.902 --> 44:58.237
Dab, dab, dab.

44:58.320 --> 45:01.907
I'm gonna throw up!

45:15.838 --> 45:18.006
- Harper?
- Hi there, Sarah. How are you?

45:18.090 --> 45:20.884
It has been over 24 hours
since you've checked in.

45:20.968 --> 45:24.012
- Where the fuck are you?
- I'm actually leaving a meeting.

45:24.096 --> 45:28.267
- I've been looking for new clients and...
- You're fucking lying to me.

45:28.350 --> 45:31.854
You do me a favor, you take those
goddamn cocks out of your ear

45:31.937 --> 45:34.249
and stick them back in your mouth,
so you can listen to what I'm saying,

45:34.273 --> 45:37.234
'cause I got some shit I gotta throw
at your face right fucking now.

45:37.317 --> 45:39.653
This little dinner meeting tomorrow,

45:39.737 --> 45:43.615
- it is a breakfast meeting, okay? 11 a.m.
- Tomorrow morning?

45:43.699 --> 45:46.994
Yeah, so take a tub of concealer
and shove it under you eyes

45:47.077 --> 45:49.830
and take a package of douche
and shove it up your twat

45:49.913 --> 45:53.125
because you need to go there looking
and smelling fresh. You got it?

45:53.208 --> 45:55.669
You know, I think
probably a dinner meeting is better.

45:55.753 --> 46:00.090
I'm really trying to set the scene
with this pitch and I...

46:00.215 --> 46:03.385
It hinges on an evening atmosphere.
It's gotta be at night.

46:03.469 --> 46:07.681
Listen, you little fucking hipster Barbie.
You need to close this deal.

46:07.765 --> 46:09.391
This is a huge get for this company.

46:09.475 --> 46:12.227
It's a good thing I have a really amazing
international plan,

46:12.311 --> 46:14.313
or I would just be so mad
at you right now.

46:14.396 --> 46:17.333
I don't want to hear anymore from you,
because I'd have to be like, "Oh, cool."

46:17.357 --> 46:18.734
And I don't care.

46:21.069 --> 46:23.489
Yes, I completely understand
what you are saying.

46:23.572 --> 46:27.868
I am just assuring you that I have this
and that the client seemed to love me,

46:27.951 --> 46:30.551
and I will call you tomorrow
after I have nailed the presentation.

46:30.621 --> 46:32.414
- Okay? Thank you very much.
- Harper!

46:32.498 --> 46:34.708
- Have a wonderful evening.
- Harper!

46:34.792 --> 46:38.754
Okay, all right, here's the thing.
The thing is everything has changed.

46:38.879 --> 46:41.298
There's no longer a dinner meeting.
It's at 11 a.m.

46:41.381 --> 46:43.141
and our flight lands
in Barcelona at ten a.m.

46:43.217 --> 46:47.262
Which means we're cutting it very close,
but guess what, my give-a-fuck meter

46:47.346 --> 46:50.641
is at zero, so we're gonna party all night
and just not miss our flight tomorrow.

46:50.724 --> 46:52.142
Yes!

46:55.771 --> 46:58.565
Custodia! That's my niece.

46:58.649 --> 47:00.150
¿Pasenla muy bien, ay?

47:00.234 --> 47:01.568
Hola, tio.

47:02.402 --> 47:05.364
- ¿Como estas?
- Tan guapa como siempre, mira las cuidas.

47:05.447 --> 47:07.866
- Hello, ladies.
- Hi.

47:07.950 --> 47:09.243
Thank you.

47:09.326 --> 47:11.078
Change and shower and stuff.

47:11.161 --> 47:12.788
No, come on.

47:12.871 --> 47:14.081
Come on, chop, chop!

47:15.290 --> 47:19.378
- I feel good, ladies. Do you feel good?
- Yeah!

47:21.171 --> 47:24.466
- Okay, hold the wheel.
- Oh, no.

47:24.550 --> 47:26.260
What, no, what are you doing?

47:26.343 --> 47:29.763
I need to get this outfit off.

47:29.847 --> 47:32.474
Why not pull over
and you can change in leisure.

47:32.558 --> 47:35.269
I need to dress like a lady
for my uncle.

47:35.727 --> 47:37.980
Whoa! Whoa. Oh.

47:38.856 --> 47:40.482
I'll be right back.

47:41.275 --> 47:44.236
Don't worry,
I just need to get drugs for my nose.

47:44.319 --> 47:47.614
Okay? Good, good, good, good!

47:47.698 --> 47:48.866
So happy!

47:50.325 --> 47:54.079
Oh, Diego texted me back.
"An unbuttoned silk blouse

47:54.162 --> 47:58.500
with my brief and soft, sexy slippers.
What about you?"

47:58.625 --> 48:00.919
- What?
- I asked him what he was wearing.

48:01.003 --> 48:02.504
Look at you sexting!

48:02.588 --> 48:05.924
That's him? Throw out the plan B.

48:06.008 --> 48:08.218
He can do a handstand!

48:08.302 --> 48:12.681
Fuck that,
like it's a thanksgiving buffet, bitch.

48:13.765 --> 48:16.602
Don't... don't touch my phone.

48:16.685 --> 48:19.438
Guys, when should I call Leo?
Should I call him right now?

48:19.521 --> 48:21.690
Just be cool, like the opposite of this.

48:21.773 --> 48:25.819
- Okay, I can do that.
- No, that's too much.

48:25.903 --> 48:28.322
- No, this is, like, actually blinding me.
- Yeah.

48:29.114 --> 48:32.075
- He can't see that strut, either.
- Don't strut.

48:32.159 --> 48:33.159
Just be normal.

48:34.369 --> 48:35.579
No, no.

48:35.662 --> 48:37.664
Hey, this is Leo, leave a message.

48:37.873 --> 48:41.501
Leaving a message. Hi, Leo. It's Harper.

48:41.585 --> 48:45.631
You may remember me as the girl
with the glowing dick on my face.

48:45.714 --> 48:50.677
So I'm in Ibiza, and I know you're playing
at Flow tonight and...

48:50.802 --> 48:54.431
I thought maybe we could find each other.

48:54.514 --> 48:58.143
Oh, boy, hold on.
There's something happening.

48:58.226 --> 49:00.020
Vamos, vamos, vamos.

49:00.103 --> 49:03.941
I'm vamosing.
Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that...

49:04.358 --> 49:07.235
You're sweet. Look at you!

49:07.319 --> 49:09.363
I'm sorry, sir, there's no room for you.

49:09.446 --> 49:12.282
So you could call me or text me...

49:12.366 --> 49:16.662
- Your message has been deleted. Goodbye.
- Oh, no. Don't erase! God damn it!

49:17.120 --> 49:18.664
Stupid fucking phone.

49:26.338 --> 49:28.298
Hey, it's Harper's phone, leave a message.

49:30.384 --> 49:31.677
Harper, hi...

49:33.387 --> 49:35.847
It's Leo from the other night. Hello.

49:37.849 --> 49:40.769
I'm glad you called. How you doing?

49:42.104 --> 49:44.856
You can't answer that
because this is a voice mail.

49:44.940 --> 49:51.071
I did not expect to hear your voice
when I called back that number.

49:51.154 --> 49:53.907
I don't know what I was expecting,
but I wasn't expecting you.

49:53.991 --> 49:57.077
I was hoping it was gonna be you,
and it was you.

49:57.160 --> 49:59.538
Which is what I was hoping for,
which is good.

50:00.831 --> 50:02.249
Yes...

50:02.958 --> 50:07.170
Anyway, yeah, I would like
to hear your voice again live.

50:07.546 --> 50:10.590
Even better, I'd like to see you live.

50:11.466 --> 50:14.219
Live is better than dead.
I don't want to see you dead.

50:14.302 --> 50:17.055
Yeah, I wish you'd left a voice mail.

50:17.389 --> 50:20.267
I don't know how long you're
in Barcelona for.

50:20.684 --> 50:22.894
I'm in Ibiza.

50:23.645 --> 50:26.982
I wanted to see you again.

50:27.816 --> 50:32.863
It was funny and easy...

50:34.823 --> 50:38.285
And I'm still talking. Can you believe
how long this voice mail is?

50:38.368 --> 50:39.369
No, neither can I!

50:40.078 --> 50:44.583
Right, I hope you're having fun.
Give me a call back when you get this.

50:44.666 --> 50:46.001
Lots of love, bye.

50:47.669 --> 50:48.669
"Lots of love."

50:49.254 --> 50:53.550
Lots of love, you creep! Ugh!

50:54.509 --> 50:55.509
Stop.

50:56.970 --> 50:57.970
Just stop.

51:03.393 --> 51:06.521
Guys, my message got deleted,
and now my phone is dead.

51:06.688 --> 51:08.523
Aww!

51:08.607 --> 51:12.778
Okay, we play fun car roulette now!

51:12.861 --> 51:14.946
Yes, it's my favorite!

51:18.158 --> 51:19.576
Stop it!

51:23.330 --> 51:25.165
Oh, my God!

51:25.248 --> 51:27.250
This isn't funny!

51:29.127 --> 51:31.505
Okay, okay, okay.
Such party shitters.

51:43.350 --> 51:47.395
- Okay, we going to the club now, sí?
- Yes.

52:00.117 --> 52:02.035
I am fully in shock.

52:02.119 --> 52:04.788
My hands
are still locked in a fist, look.

52:04.871 --> 52:07.332
You guys, we made it, okay?

52:07.415 --> 52:09.543
- Girls! Girls!
- Go!

52:41.575 --> 52:46.288
I bring some treats
to take care of you, okay?

52:46.371 --> 52:51.418
Yeah, drink a lot of water.
Hey, agua! ¡Vamos, vamos! Huh?

52:51.501 --> 52:54.713
And not too much alcohol, sí? Uh-huh.

52:54.796 --> 52:57.340
I go to dance now, okay?

52:59.134 --> 53:02.637
I've never done ecstasy before.
I think I skipped that whole phase.

53:02.721 --> 53:05.891
Oh, my God.
It's maximum happiness, all right?

53:05.974 --> 53:10.312
Body, mind, soul, pussy, butthole,
all of it!

53:10.395 --> 53:13.023
Plus, we're gonna stay awake forever.

53:13.106 --> 53:15.525
I've never done ecstasy before either,
but it feels like

53:15.609 --> 53:17.670
if there was ever a time and place,
it's probably now.

53:17.694 --> 53:18.778
Drink up, bitches!

53:26.161 --> 53:32.334
Oh, I just feel like,
I'm in a warm cube of Jell-O.

53:33.335 --> 53:35.962
Listen, you guys are amazing.

53:36.046 --> 53:39.883
You're smart and beautiful,
and you can do anything

53:39.966 --> 53:42.302
you set your mind to.

53:42.385 --> 53:47.599
My skin feels so good,
and your skin feels so good.

53:47.682 --> 53:52.103
You two are literally the best
damn beautiful creatures

53:52.187 --> 53:54.689
- on this goddamn shitty planet.
- No, you are.

53:54.773 --> 53:58.401
- No, you!
- No, you!

53:59.819 --> 54:02.489
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow!

54:09.663 --> 54:11.665
Okay, my babies, I'll be right back.

54:33.728 --> 54:36.147
They're not gonna believe you're here!

54:43.280 --> 54:45.365
Let's go!

55:00.255 --> 55:03.591
Cheers!

55:08.346 --> 55:09.764
Mmm!

55:09.848 --> 55:11.099
Yep, yep, yep!

55:11.224 --> 55:14.436
So, Harper,
did you have any luck finding your DJ?

55:14.519 --> 55:18.565
Yes, I think he's in the building.
He should be in that booth very soon.

55:18.648 --> 55:21.067
What, are you serious?
Your DJ is Leo West?

55:21.568 --> 55:23.278
Shut up! Leo fucking West!

55:23.903 --> 55:27.866
I love him. I literally love him.
He's amazing. He's like a proper artist.

55:28.366 --> 55:31.911
He's not one of these plug
and play wankers, he's the real deal.

55:31.995 --> 55:33.705
Legit. Yeah, he's incredible.

55:33.788 --> 55:36.267
I mean, you're incredible also,
so don't know who I'm more jealous of,

55:36.291 --> 55:37.876
him or you.

55:37.959 --> 55:41.046
He's like a hero to a lot of people,
so treat him right.

55:41.129 --> 55:42.964
- Yeah, all right.
- That's all.

55:43.048 --> 55:45.151
- It's really awkward now.
- This is what you do.

55:45.175 --> 55:47.177
He's doing this thing
to try and connect with you.

55:47.302 --> 55:50.221
Thing is, right, you don't have a thing.
This is not gonna be your night.

55:50.305 --> 55:52.223
Listen, these two have a thing.

55:52.307 --> 55:54.309
They're clearly
gonna be fucking tonight, right?

55:54.392 --> 55:57.562
You have a thing with Leo West.
You're clearly gonna be fucking him.

55:57.645 --> 55:59.814
Me and Nikki, you know, we're fucking.

55:59.898 --> 56:02.901
- But you, it's not your night, bro.
- No.

56:02.984 --> 56:05.779
We're fucking friends though!

56:05.862 --> 56:07.822
Oh!

56:07.989 --> 56:11.117
Denied!

56:11.201 --> 56:14.537
- Nikki, you're gonna do me like that?
- Okay, he's not technically my boyfriend,

56:14.621 --> 56:18.792
but his name's Diego, and I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna have sex with him soon.

56:21.878 --> 56:23.963
So sorry to interrupt,
but I'm gonna go find him.

56:24.130 --> 56:25.840
- Oh!
- Holy shit!

56:54.411 --> 56:58.873
¡Lo siento, lo siento!
¡Lo siento, lo siento, lo siento!

57:01.668 --> 57:02.794
Custodia!

57:04.504 --> 57:05.630
Custodia!

57:06.506 --> 57:09.092
- Hey!
- Hi.

57:09.175 --> 57:11.761
Can you come here?
Can you come down here?

57:17.559 --> 57:19.936
- Hi!
- I see you feel it.

57:20.019 --> 57:22.021
I need to find Leo West.

57:24.983 --> 57:26.651
- I bring you to him.
- Okay!

57:52.302 --> 57:54.304
- You wait here, okay?
- Okay.

57:55.346 --> 58:00.560
Mr. Leo,
I brought what you are looking for!

58:01.227 --> 58:02.812
- Look.
- Hi.

58:04.647 --> 58:07.692
Can I come in?
Is he gonna hurt me? Okay, hi!

58:07.775 --> 58:10.153
- God, it's good to see you.
- You too, man!

58:10.236 --> 58:12.071
- What's up?
- Right, cool.

58:12.155 --> 58:14.282
- I go dance now, okay?
- Okay.

58:14.407 --> 58:16.409
- You make love!
- What?

58:16.951 --> 58:18.745
- What did she say?
- We make love.

58:18.828 --> 58:21.498
Oh, sweet! I thought I hear that,
but I wasn't sure.

58:21.623 --> 58:23.625
- Great, no cocks this time.
- Yeah, sure.

58:23.708 --> 58:26.252
- Which is good, it works.
- Thanks. I don't know about you,

58:26.336 --> 58:28.022
I have't seen you in a black light.
You could still have one.

58:28.046 --> 58:29.881
I might still have one.

58:29.964 --> 58:31.758
- You haven't!
- Come in.

58:31.841 --> 58:32.961
Okay, sorry. That was weird.

58:36.679 --> 58:38.306
It's really good to see you.

58:38.973 --> 58:42.227
- Yeah.
- I feel like I know you. It's weird.

58:42.310 --> 58:43.728
Even though I don't.

58:44.395 --> 58:48.691
Because you could be a sociopath
or just a massive douchebag.

58:48.775 --> 58:51.653
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
I'm the worst.

58:51.736 --> 58:55.198
You're not the worst.
No, I have been actually leaving you

58:55.281 --> 58:59.911
rambling voice mails
and calling up Barcelona billionaires,

58:59.994 --> 59:02.389
-trying to find out where you are.
- You left me a voicemail?

59:02.413 --> 59:03.790
- You didn't get it?
- No.

59:03.915 --> 59:06.709
- Oh, thank God, it was embarrassing.
- Oh, my God!

59:06.793 --> 59:10.296
I wouldn't know anything about that,
'cause I leave really cool voice mails.

59:10.380 --> 59:12.382
- Really?
- I'm really good at it.

59:13.341 --> 59:14.551
Sir, 15 minutes.

59:16.344 --> 59:20.473
- I have to go on soon.
- Really, until when?

59:20.598 --> 59:21.891
Closing, six.

59:22.350 --> 59:24.894
That... well, that blows.

59:25.645 --> 59:28.805
- How long are you on the island for?
- I gotta be back in Barcelona at ten a.m.

59:29.607 --> 59:31.609
- That does suck.
- Yeah.

59:32.235 --> 59:33.319
All right.

59:34.612 --> 59:37.156
Okay.
I'm just gonna be honest with you.

59:37.240 --> 59:40.285
I'm on a lot of drugs right now,
and I have flown all the way here,

59:40.368 --> 59:43.037
and I had a whole other shirt on before
that I just took off.

59:43.162 --> 59:44.998
Normally, I don't take a lot of risks.

59:45.081 --> 59:47.917
So even just being here
is a huge milestone for me.

59:48.001 --> 59:51.379
The definition of insanity is not living
your passion because you're afraid

59:51.462 --> 59:53.524
of swimming against the stream
or something like that,

59:53.548 --> 59:57.468
so I think what you should do
is you tell those promoters

59:57.552 --> 01:00:00.847
that you are only gonna do half your set
and that you have an emergency

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:03.410
and then we're just gonna
spend the rest of the night together.

01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:06.810
All right.

01:00:07.562 --> 01:00:10.457
Are you saying that just to shut me up
or 'cause you actually are saying okay?

01:00:10.481 --> 01:00:13.443
No, 'cause I'm actually saying okay.
Fuck, I've never done this before.

01:00:13.526 --> 01:00:17.196
- I will work it out.
- Wait, this is happening?

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:20.867
Yeah, go and dance with your friends
and then come back here at three.

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:22.243
- Okay. Yeah.
- Okay.

01:00:33.087 --> 01:00:36.007
Sorry, was that okay?
Yeah, it was good. It was good.

01:00:36.090 --> 01:00:37.467
That was great.

01:00:43.181 --> 01:00:45.224
- Okay.
- Okay, three.

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:47.644
Sweet. You said three. I said sweet.

01:00:47.727 --> 01:00:49.812
- Three o'clock. I will see you three.
- Yeah.

01:00:49.896 --> 01:00:51.696
It's the difference in out accents.
It's cool.

01:00:52.231 --> 01:00:53.274
Oh, my God.

01:00:54.776 --> 01:00:55.776
Hi.

01:00:59.405 --> 01:01:03.201
Okay, but don't forget to be
at the airport at 8:30 a.m. tomorrow.

01:01:03.284 --> 01:01:05.078
- Yes. Got it.
- But your phone died,

01:01:05.161 --> 01:01:07.246
so please don't fucking oversleep.

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:09.123
I don't think
I'm gonna be sleeping tonight.

01:01:09.207 --> 01:01:12.251
- Oh!
- Yeah!

01:01:12.877 --> 01:01:15.254
- But be responsible.
- James, please.

01:01:15.797 --> 01:01:20.426
- James, please. Chill out.
- But don't forget, airport, meeting, job.

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:23.680
Airport, meeting, job.
Airport, meeting, job!

01:01:23.763 --> 01:01:26.724
Airport, meeting, job!
Airport, meeting, job!

01:01:26.849 --> 01:01:29.018
Airport, meeting, job!
Airport, meeting, job!

01:01:47.036 --> 01:01:48.996
I want you to welcome to the stage

01:01:49.664 --> 01:01:52.625
a very special guest DJ!

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:58.798
Leo West!

01:02:06.806 --> 01:02:09.684
Ibiza!

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:39.464
Ibiza!

01:02:40.798 --> 01:02:42.467
It's been fucking crazy all night.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:47.430
I got to leave a little early.
I got to meet a girl.

01:02:50.349 --> 01:02:53.728
Boys, you know what I'm talking about.
Good night!

01:03:18.503 --> 01:03:20.213
- Wait. My hair.
- I'm sorry.

01:03:42.902 --> 01:03:44.904
Oh, no. This is...

01:03:45.238 --> 01:03:47.406
This is really...

01:03:48.324 --> 01:03:51.661
This is a dumb room, one would say.

01:03:53.287 --> 01:03:57.291
- You want some champagne?
- Sure, why not? Yeah.

01:03:57.375 --> 01:04:00.461
A lot of nice copper details in here,
I appreciate that.

01:04:01.003 --> 01:04:02.797
You don't pay for this room, do you?

01:04:03.381 --> 01:04:06.300
No, good.
It's not worth whatever they're paying.

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:08.553
Oh, just getting some space.

01:04:13.307 --> 01:04:16.227
Ho, ho! Is that a fucking hot tub?

01:04:16.310 --> 01:04:20.064
On a deck, overlooking the ocean.
This is like a date on The Bachelor.

01:04:43.254 --> 01:04:47.133
Well, I'd love to take a little nap,
so I'm just not sure where to go.

01:04:47.216 --> 01:04:49.427
- Let me take you to my spare room.
- Oh!

01:04:50.386 --> 01:04:52.763
Oh.

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:54.891
- This way.
- Okay.

01:04:54.974 --> 01:04:59.270
- Would you like the king or the queen bed?
- Well, this is a bathroom.

01:04:59.353 --> 01:05:00.563
Love you.

01:05:02.315 --> 01:05:04.066
Yes, yes, yes.

01:05:10.781 --> 01:05:12.408
Okay, let's tuck you in.

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:14.660
You must be tired.

01:05:15.244 --> 01:05:18.039
Sleepy Nikki needs to go
to sleepy time, right?

01:05:18.539 --> 01:05:21.542
- If you want any water...
- I know how a faucet works.

01:05:21.626 --> 01:05:23.544
So I'm in luck, I'll see you later.

01:05:23.628 --> 01:05:26.005
- Hey, Miles.
- I'm gonna go get Leah

01:05:26.505 --> 01:05:30.051
to have a nice relaxing seat on my face.
Wish me luck.

01:05:32.178 --> 01:05:35.097
- Miles!
- I'm coming, sweet pea.

01:05:35.556 --> 01:05:37.224
Wow, he's a lot.

01:05:45.399 --> 01:05:48.694
- Oh, shit, that was hot.
- You're pretty hot.

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:50.538
- You're pretty hot,
- No, you're pretty hot.

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:51.781
No, you're pretty hot.

01:06:06.379 --> 01:06:09.840
Okay, that's what I call a dick pic.
Check, please.

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:21.018
So, Harper's with a DJ.

01:06:21.769 --> 01:06:23.980
Leah's in that room doing whatever,

01:06:24.605 --> 01:06:27.608
and Nikki's in a bathtub.

01:06:28.401 --> 01:06:29.777
Classic Nikki.

01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:42.248
I have never left a gig before, ever.

01:06:42.331 --> 01:06:43.331
I want you...

01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:46.877
- ...to know that.
- All right.

01:06:46.961 --> 01:06:50.923
Not sure I believe you,
Mr. Slutty International DJ.

01:06:52.216 --> 01:06:55.052
Are you slut shaming me?

01:06:55.177 --> 01:06:57.513
Yeah, a little bit, I am.

01:06:58.139 --> 01:07:00.891
Well, I'm not the one sitting
in some random guy's hot tub.

01:07:00.975 --> 01:07:04.020
- Oh, got me there.
- Mm-hmm.

01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:09.734
I mean, I don't want you to think
that's what I do all the time

01:07:09.817 --> 01:07:14.363
or I just, like, pick girls out
and do this and I throw all these lines,

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:17.992
and I don't want you to think that
about me. That's, like, not who I am.

01:07:18.075 --> 01:07:19.075
That's not what...

01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:21.078
I believe you.

01:07:22.997 --> 01:07:23.997
Good.

01:07:25.666 --> 01:07:28.627
- 'Cause I care about what you think.
- Oh, you do?

01:07:29.003 --> 01:07:30.897
I didn't mean to say that.
Did I say that out loud?

01:07:30.921 --> 01:07:33.340
- You said it out loud.
- Oh, God, I hate myself.

01:07:33.424 --> 01:07:36.052
That's nice, I like it,
thank you very much.

01:07:40.097 --> 01:07:44.435
- I've never dated a guy like you.
- Me neither.

01:07:44.518 --> 01:07:47.772
- What kind of guys do you date?
- Really fucking handsome ones.

01:07:47.855 --> 01:07:50.649
- Ooh!
- Not like this, like handsome.

01:07:51.317 --> 01:07:54.403
Cool, I'd like to meet them.

01:07:59.325 --> 01:08:00.325
Tell me the truth,

01:08:00.785 --> 01:08:03.746
have you really never walked out
on a gig before?

01:08:06.665 --> 01:08:07.665
Never.

01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:11.712
And you're shit at lying so I believe you.

01:08:11.796 --> 01:08:13.506
Yeah.

01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:24.349
Click.

01:08:25.725 --> 01:08:28.437
Click, click.

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:32.274
- And what was that?
- That was my mind camera,

01:08:32.358 --> 01:08:33.484
taking photographs.

01:08:37.988 --> 01:08:40.533
Click, click, click.

01:08:52.044 --> 01:08:54.755
- I have a flight tomorrow, okay?
- Okay.

01:08:54.839 --> 01:08:58.425
Um...

01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:00.928
Also, also, don't forget.

01:09:01.011 --> 01:09:04.932
I shouldn't sleep in too late.
My friend said I shouldn't forget that.

01:09:05.015 --> 01:09:07.434
- Um... also...
- Mm-hmm.

01:09:10.604 --> 01:09:14.358
Just a moment,
I'm just having a moment, just a moment.

01:09:14.441 --> 01:09:20.573
It's probably more about the drugs
and the drinking and the Spain.

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:25.118
It's just some sort of European thing,
right? We don't really know each other.

01:09:25.202 --> 01:09:30.457
So this is all pure projection, you know?
Right? 'Cause I don't know.

01:09:30.916 --> 01:09:32.126
My God, oh, shit.

01:09:32.459 --> 01:09:36.462
Perfect, you're flawless,
and that's why this is perfect.

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:42.094
Or maybe we just like each other.

01:09:44.596 --> 01:09:47.850
Oh, God. Or that I'm really fucked.

01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:49.434
Me too.

01:10:25.137 --> 01:10:29.016
Fuck!

01:10:29.099 --> 01:10:30.099
What?

01:10:30.601 --> 01:10:33.145
Fuck!

01:10:35.981 --> 01:10:38.692
- Shit! Fucking alarm!
- What's wrong?

01:10:38.776 --> 01:10:40.527
Airport, meeting, job.

01:10:40.611 --> 01:10:41.611
Damn.

01:10:42.655 --> 01:10:44.031
This is good.

01:10:44.114 --> 01:10:46.742
Oh, you loved that hot tub last night,
didn't you, Harper?

01:10:49.453 --> 01:10:50.453
No!

01:10:51.038 --> 01:10:54.458
You're gonna get fired.
Everyone's gonna hate you.

01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:59.338
Your mom is gonna be
so fucking disappointed in you.

01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:02.883
How are you going to explain this?
How are you going to explain this?

01:11:02.967 --> 01:11:04.093
You can't!

01:11:04.176 --> 01:11:07.346
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:11.433
It's all good. It's all good.
I'm gonna be fired,

01:11:11.517 --> 01:11:13.686
and I have to be in Barcelona
in five minutes, so...

01:11:13.769 --> 01:11:15.664
It's all right. I'll come to the airport
with you, all right?

01:11:15.688 --> 01:11:20.317
- Okay, how do I look?
- Let's go, just don't look that way.

01:11:20.401 --> 01:11:21.485
Off we go.

01:11:22.444 --> 01:11:24.530
I knew it. Where is she?

01:11:25.197 --> 01:11:28.867
- Stop screaming.
- Okay, we wait, like, five minutes max.

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:31.328
Then we call the police,
we go on Anderson Cooper,

01:11:31.412 --> 01:11:34.540
- we start an investigation.
- No, stop, stop, stop.

01:11:34.623 --> 01:11:38.752
- They're boarding now. We just gotta go.
- All right.

01:11:41.797 --> 01:11:44.133
- She's so fired.
- Stop saying it.

01:11:44.216 --> 01:11:47.094
We're gonna figure this out.
I have a good plan.

01:11:49.763 --> 01:11:51.963
- I can't believe I did this!
- Stop it, it's all right.

01:11:54.935 --> 01:11:56.770
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:12:00.441 --> 01:12:01.317
What are you doing?

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:04.653
I just want one picture
that you've not got a dick on your face.

01:12:04.737 --> 01:12:06.864
You have to delete that.
You promised me you would.

01:12:06.947 --> 01:12:07.823
- Don't make me.
- Why?

01:12:07.906 --> 01:12:09.676
Because it's how we met
and we'll show it to our kids one day.

01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:11.327
Our kids? Are you kidding me?

01:12:11.410 --> 01:12:14.413
With global warming,
we've got, like, ten years left, max.

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:20.919
- Are you okay? I'm good.
- Yeah, yeah, just...

01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:22.254
Right there.

01:12:38.103 --> 01:12:39.980
I don't want to say goodbye.

01:12:40.314 --> 01:12:41.314
Me neither.

01:12:42.358 --> 01:12:44.360
Uh...

01:12:44.568 --> 01:12:47.571
Well, thank you
for coming to the airport with me.

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:53.619
- Thank you for coming to Ibiza for me.
- I didn't come to Ibiza for you...

01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:55.704
Fuck it, I did, I did.

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:03.253
Um... Okay, I have to go.

01:13:04.004 --> 01:13:06.006
You know, I've never met anyone like you.

01:13:07.591 --> 01:13:09.343
- And you know how I know that?
- Hmm?

01:13:11.387 --> 01:13:13.972
Because if I did, I'd make sure
I still knew that person.

01:13:20.813 --> 01:13:23.107
Okay.

01:13:25.651 --> 01:13:29.279
If I don't see you again,
this was really fun and...

01:13:30.489 --> 01:13:31.949
...I'm glad.

01:13:52.052 --> 01:13:55.722
- More nasally if you could,
- Hi, I'm Harper.

01:13:55.973 --> 01:14:01.019
I'm beautiful, but insecure in a way
that makes my friends very frustrated.

01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:03.939
I just threw clothes together
and somehow, they look so cool.

01:14:04.022 --> 01:14:05.482
I'm Harper.

01:14:05.566 --> 01:14:07.484
By the way, 100%.

01:14:07.568 --> 01:14:09.194
I'm selling you the sangria.

01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:12.948
- I mean, you're selling me the sangria.
- That was good.

01:14:14.366 --> 01:14:16.660
- Oh.
- You look so beautiful.

01:14:24.543 --> 01:14:26.670
- I brought you clothes.
- Oh, thank you.

01:14:26.753 --> 01:14:27.753
You're sweet.

01:14:28.255 --> 01:14:30.841
- Hey, girl, ready to do this?
- Hello.

01:14:33.969 --> 01:14:38.724
Okay, I gotta go. I gotta go.
Okay, I'm so sorry. I gotta go.

01:14:38.807 --> 01:14:40.225
Sorry, I have an emergency!

01:14:42.478 --> 01:14:46.190
Nikki, this is going to be perfect.
You're a genius.

01:14:46.273 --> 01:14:50.027
You're amazing and most importantly,
you look damn good.

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:53.739
I kind of know that I do,
and I feel like Harper,

01:14:53.822 --> 01:14:56.116
but maybe, like, more professional.

01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:59.536
Oh, yes, Susie Orman over here, okay!

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:02.581
Nothing to see,
just getting business done.

01:15:04.374 --> 01:15:06.835
Oh, were you guys wondering
about strategies?

01:15:06.919 --> 01:15:09.296
That's what business people know,
like me.

01:15:10.422 --> 01:15:13.300
Hello, sir,
please don't eavesdrop on my business.

01:15:23.685 --> 01:15:27.147
- Harper, this is Guillermo.
- Yes, nice... mm-hmm.

01:15:27.231 --> 01:15:28.273
Okay.

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:33.028
And I've corresponded with you
in the emails and such things.

01:15:33.111 --> 01:15:35.948
- Yes, and Jose.
- Jose, okay.

01:15:36.031 --> 01:15:38.242
We have communicated via emails as well.

01:15:38.867 --> 01:15:39.993
This is amazing.

01:15:41.036 --> 01:15:42.704
I'm a goddamn mastermind.

01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:58.262
- Leah, Leah!
- Oh, my God, Harper!

01:15:58.345 --> 01:16:01.014
- Holy shit, you're safe. You scared me.
- I'm safe.

01:16:01.098 --> 01:16:03.392
I fucked up, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna get fired.

01:16:03.475 --> 01:16:07.271
You're not. Nikki and I have a plan,
just hold on to your shorts.

01:16:07.354 --> 01:16:12.526
Here's a question. Who at this table
wants to get filthy fucking rich?

01:16:12.609 --> 01:16:16.071
- What is she doing in there?
- Taking the meeting as you. It's fine.

01:16:16.154 --> 01:16:19.157
- I got to get in there...
- Oh, no, you reek of sex.

01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:22.953
Like, high-five but also,
that's some ho business.

01:16:23.036 --> 01:16:26.290
Look, she's like a white Steve Jobs.
She's got this. It's fine.

01:16:26.373 --> 01:16:28.709
What you might notice
about both of these charts

01:16:28.792 --> 01:16:31.461
is that the line thingy in them
is going up.

01:16:31.545 --> 01:16:36.133
Three words for you,
virtual, reality, experience.

01:16:37.009 --> 01:16:40.804
That would require us
hiring some kind of technology...

01:16:41.388 --> 01:16:44.683
person who worked in virtual reality,
but at the end of the day....

01:16:46.518 --> 01:16:49.229
She's touching Diego
an uncomfortable amount.

01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:54.526
Yeah, they full on boned.
He fucked the confidence into her.

01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:55.944
She's so animated.

01:16:56.028 --> 01:16:58.071
Sorry, self driving cars,
we've got Sangria.

01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:01.867
Perfect!

01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:05.329
Well, I do very accurate accents.

01:17:05.412 --> 01:17:08.081
Harper, you make a wonderful argument
for your company

01:17:08.165 --> 01:17:11.960
and seem to understand the vision
of our brand very well.

01:17:12.044 --> 01:17:16.506
- Thank you.
- I think it is no-brainer. We shake hands.

01:17:17.007 --> 01:17:20.052
We can have some more drinks
and from now on,

01:17:20.135 --> 01:17:23.472
we can say we are in business.

01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:25.515
Oh, thank you, thank you!

01:17:28.769 --> 01:17:30.479
Oh, my God, this is awesome!

01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:33.982
- Wait. Why is he getting his laptop?
- It's fine, it's fine.

01:17:34.066 --> 01:17:37.027
- It's a computer. Just... oh, no.
- Oh, no.

01:17:37.611 --> 01:17:40.489
Is this a good news call?
It feels like it is.

01:17:40.572 --> 01:17:44.534
Why, yes, it is. We are here with Harper,
and she's wonderful.

01:17:45.744 --> 01:17:47.704
- Go to the bathroom.
- Hey, Harper!

01:17:47.788 --> 01:17:48.788
Say hello to your boss!

01:17:48.872 --> 01:17:50.957
Hello.

01:17:51.041 --> 01:17:53.001
No, oh, no, no, no!

01:17:53.085 --> 01:17:55.921
- Harper, say hello.
- Sorry, who is that?

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:59.466
Who is that? Who the fuck is that?

01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:01.968
- Hi, it's Harper!
- Harper!

01:18:02.094 --> 01:18:03.553
Where the fuck are you?

01:18:04.638 --> 01:18:08.600
Hi, I was in the bathroom, so I'm here,
the deal's going really well.

01:18:08.684 --> 01:18:11.124
I think they are gonna go for it,
and I think it's been great!

01:18:11.186 --> 01:18:14.439
Holy fucking shit, you get any sleep
while you were in Spain?

01:18:14.564 --> 01:18:17.484
No, but it's 'cause I was working
really hard,

01:18:17.984 --> 01:18:20.821
all night, on my presentation.

01:18:20.904 --> 01:18:23.156
- What the hell is going on?
- I honestly don't know,

01:18:23.281 --> 01:18:25.909
- but there are two Harpers.
- Harper!

01:18:25.992 --> 01:18:27.637
When you get back,
I'm gonna rip your face apart,

01:18:27.661 --> 01:18:29.621
like a goddamn pit bull...

01:18:29.705 --> 01:18:32.165
Oh, you wanted to talk to this Harper?

01:18:32.290 --> 01:18:34.251
- That's where the confusion...
- Harper!

01:18:34.334 --> 01:18:36.753
Bye. Okay.

01:18:36.878 --> 01:18:37.878
I really...

01:18:38.547 --> 01:18:40.006
...I do love your sangria.

01:18:40.590 --> 01:18:41.800
It's wonderful.

01:18:46.179 --> 01:18:48.807
I'm sorry, I didn't...

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:01.486
Okay, okay.

01:19:01.903 --> 01:19:03.613
- First you need to...
- Sit up

01:19:03.697 --> 01:19:06.575
because you don't want a lot
of exposed skin on the jizz.

01:19:06.658 --> 01:19:09.035
- Too much exposed skin.
- There's a lot of jizz here.

01:19:18.086 --> 01:19:19.421
Let's go home.

01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:21.131
Yes.

01:19:23.675 --> 01:19:26.553
- Hey.
- Let's go home.

01:20:59.729 --> 01:21:00.772
You know,

01:21:02.023 --> 01:21:04.651
I thought about turning the pictures
of the twins around

01:21:04.734 --> 01:21:06.027
when I met with you today,

01:21:06.111 --> 01:21:09.406
because didn't want them to see this,
but you know maybe

01:21:09.489 --> 01:21:11.908
this is a real teachable moment
for them to see mommy

01:21:11.992 --> 01:21:16.121
- try to steer you in a direction.
- Okay.

01:21:17.372 --> 01:21:19.875
So let me just start by saying,

01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:24.462
- I'm really fucking disappointed in you!
- I know.

01:21:24.546 --> 01:21:29.175
I gave you adult responsibility,
thinking, "Oh, what? Maybe she'll grow up

01:21:29.259 --> 01:21:32.304
and show me she's got what it takes
to move up in this job."

01:21:32.387 --> 01:21:33.847
- Okay.
- Yeah, but instead,

01:21:33.930 --> 01:21:36.766
you treat it like
a goddamn Coachella vacation,

01:21:36.850 --> 01:21:41.062
fiesta, bonita, Mad Max, shit parade.
Giving blowies for gelato

01:21:41.146 --> 01:21:44.107
and stripping for tapas
with your little slut bucket friends.

01:21:44.190 --> 01:21:45.190
Ow.

01:21:48.695 --> 01:21:50.756
- Are you firing me?
- Oh, yeah, fuck yes, I am, yes.

01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:51.780
Fuck yes.

01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:54.993
Well, in that case,

01:21:55.744 --> 01:21:57.996
I have a few things
that I would like to say to you.

01:22:00.373 --> 01:22:02.918
- I hate you.
- Oh, well, join the club.

01:22:03.001 --> 01:22:06.087
I hate you,
and I feel sorry for your twins.

01:22:06.504 --> 01:22:08.381
You're a terrible person,

01:22:08.465 --> 01:22:12.928
and you are an awful boss,
and everyone here hates you,

01:22:13.386 --> 01:22:16.348
- and you're not even good at your job.
- Excuse me.

01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:18.767
Shut up.

01:22:18.850 --> 01:22:22.562
And thank you for firing me,
therefore voiding my non-compete clause

01:22:22.646 --> 01:22:25.440
so I can call Disfrute,
sign them as a client

01:22:25.523 --> 01:22:28.193
and steal all your goddamn clients.

01:22:28.276 --> 01:22:31.655
That's right.
You just met your competition.

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:34.950
- Shut your fucking mouth hole.
- Oh, one more thing!

01:22:35.033 --> 01:22:38.244
I did catch a really weird,
contagious flu on the flight so....

01:22:38.328 --> 01:22:41.581
Don't! No!

01:22:41.665 --> 01:22:43.166
Bitch!

01:22:43.249 --> 01:22:46.010
Stop it, first of all stop breathing
and touching things and secondly,

01:22:46.211 --> 01:22:48.964
- I need... hey! You stop it!
- Ooh-ooh!

01:22:49.047 --> 01:22:50.090
Bye!

01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:15.991
- I like this new side of you.
- Yeah.

01:23:16.074 --> 01:23:17.492
I've been emailing with Diego

01:23:17.575 --> 01:23:20.245
and he said that his bosses
did love my presentation.

01:23:20.328 --> 01:23:23.081
They didn't even mind
about the whole charade thing.

01:23:23.581 --> 01:23:26.751
And it seems like
I might actually score them as a client,

01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:28.211
and I could start my own firm.

01:23:28.294 --> 01:23:30.130
Wow, that's amazing.

01:23:30.213 --> 01:23:34.592
I know. And did Diego say he might
be coming to the city soon?

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:39.639
Yes! You guys, I've gotten so much better
at sexting. How's this one?

01:23:40.223 --> 01:23:44.894
You are my guapo fajita,
sizzling the fire in my loins.

01:23:45.478 --> 01:23:48.773
Okay, sure, if he's into it,
who cares what we think, right?

01:23:48.857 --> 01:23:51.776
You know, lbiza's been
pretty life changing for me, too.

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:55.447
Like, I'm thinking about settling down,
popping out a couple of babies.

01:23:55.530 --> 01:23:57.949
- Just like real norm core shit.
- Okay.

01:23:58.033 --> 01:24:01.077
Mom jeans, packed lunch.

01:24:02.495 --> 01:24:03.538
Oh, my God...

01:24:04.122 --> 01:24:07.709
- Leo's calling me.
- Answer it. Go answer it.

01:24:14.466 --> 01:24:15.592
Hello.

01:24:16.217 --> 01:24:18.011
Hello.

01:24:18.678 --> 01:24:21.181
I've got a a layover in Paris.
I thought I'd call and leave you

01:24:21.264 --> 01:24:23.641
a rambling voice mail,
but you've answered instead,

01:24:23.725 --> 01:24:25.727
which is much, much better.

01:24:25.810 --> 01:24:27.687
It's crazy to hear your voice.

01:24:27.854 --> 01:24:29.856
Crazy, like good crazy or...

01:24:30.356 --> 01:24:31.357
Great crazy.

01:24:36.905 --> 01:24:38.907
I can't stop thinking about you.

01:24:40.575 --> 01:24:41.743
Yeah, me too.

01:24:45.163 --> 01:24:47.457
- Do you want to come to Tokyo?
- What?

01:24:48.083 --> 01:24:52.378
I'm playing there this weekend, so come.
Do you want to come on me?

01:24:52.462 --> 01:24:55.256
We can go to the Kyoto Gardens.

01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:57.801
There's this fucking robot bar.

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:00.345
Uh...

01:25:00.428 --> 01:25:04.182
- That's insane.
- I know, like fucking robots

01:25:04.265 --> 01:25:07.143
to give you drinks. I don't know
if they actually give you the drinks...

01:25:08.019 --> 01:25:10.772
Tokyo you're talking about that's insane,
isn't it, not the robots.

01:25:10.855 --> 01:25:12.649
Uh, okay. Um...

01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:15.900
What what do you say?
Do you want to come to Tokyo?

01:25:22.367 --> 01:25:23.701
I would love to.

01:25:24.452 --> 01:25:27.080
But now I'm just starting
this new business,

01:25:27.163 --> 01:25:29.082
and I can't.

01:25:31.584 --> 01:25:33.711
Any chance you'll be coming
to New York soon?

01:25:35.296 --> 01:25:37.715
Yeah. Yeah, New York.

01:25:39.342 --> 01:25:41.928
- I'd like that.
- I would like that, too.

01:25:42.595 --> 01:25:44.180
I would really like that.

01:25:49.394 --> 01:25:51.396
I had a really good time with you.

01:25:52.313 --> 01:25:53.439
I, uh...

01:25:54.274 --> 01:25:55.274
I like you.

01:25:57.694 --> 01:25:58.736
I like you, too.

01:25:59.988 --> 01:26:02.991
Okay, I'm gonna stop talking now.
This is worse than my voice mails,

01:26:03.074 --> 01:26:06.077
but I will call you.
I'll call you when I land.

01:26:07.412 --> 01:26:08.412
Okay?

01:26:10.290 --> 01:26:11.290
Okay.

01:26:13.835 --> 01:26:14.919
Bye, Harper.

01:26:17.589 --> 01:26:18.589
Bye.

01:26:31.686 --> 01:26:32.896
So...

01:26:34.981 --> 01:26:36.816
Leo asked me to meet him in Tokyo.

01:26:37.984 --> 01:26:39.319
And I said no.

01:26:39.402 --> 01:26:41.487
I told him he had to come to me.

01:26:42.238 --> 01:26:45.491
- Oh!
- Okay, yes, feminism.

01:26:47.869 --> 01:26:49.162
But you know,

01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:53.583
- you should have gone.
- Yeah, I mean, the feminism is too much

01:26:53.708 --> 01:26:57.295
in this situation and being too feminist
is anti-feminist.

01:26:57.378 --> 01:26:59.505
Stop it at wearing pants.

01:26:59.589 --> 01:27:02.508
If he wants to see me,
he has to come to me.

01:27:02.592 --> 01:27:05.511
I'm not gonna keep flying
around the world to see him.

01:27:05.595 --> 01:27:09.515
We'll go to Tokyo with him,
and then we'll come back here,

01:27:09.599 --> 01:27:12.143
- and then you'll make him come to you.
- Right.

01:27:12.727 --> 01:27:13.727
No.

01:27:14.103 --> 01:27:15.396
Yes!

01:33:35.192 --> 01:33:40.323
Thank you very much. Mucho gracias.
