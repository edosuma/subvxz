WEBVTT

00:04.352 --> 00:05.527
[footsteps approaching]

00:07.311 --> 00:09.052
Hey, Cho.

00:09.139 --> 00:10.619
Okay, how'd you do that?

00:10.706 --> 00:13.274
Well, you tread
a little heavier than Lisbon

00:13.361 --> 00:15.102
and Rigsby's car
isn't in the lot.

00:15.189 --> 00:16.538
We've got a case
and Lisbon's busy.

00:16.625 --> 00:18.061
So you and I
are riding out.

00:18.148 --> 00:19.889
Excellent.
I'll meet you downstairs.

00:19.976 --> 00:21.543
Okay.

00:21.630 --> 00:22.935
[pen clicks]

00:25.155 --> 00:27.027
[door rumbles]

00:34.556 --> 00:35.905
[lock rattles]

00:39.735 --> 00:41.258
[snaps]

00:45.001 --> 00:46.916
[birds chirping]

00:51.094 --> 00:52.704
[car door closes]

00:52.791 --> 00:54.271
Quaint.

00:54.358 --> 00:55.490
Yeah.

01:05.978 --> 01:07.589
I'm Kimball Cho.
This is Patrick Jane.

01:07.676 --> 01:10.635
County coroner. Deb Granger.
Pleased to meet you.

01:10.722 --> 01:12.159
We don't get to work
a lot of murders around here.

01:12.246 --> 01:13.856
You got a little, uh,
something on your..

01:13.943 --> 01:16.380
- Oh. Brain matter. Good catch.
- Mm.

01:16.467 --> 01:19.340
Victim's name is Hollis Percy.
61 years of age.

01:19.427 --> 01:20.645
'His wife found him
this morning.'

01:20.732 --> 01:22.038
'And he owned
the town of Percy.'

01:22.125 --> 01:23.170
The whole town?

01:23.257 --> 01:24.867
Yeah. Schools, roads, bakery..

01:24.954 --> 01:26.303
been in his family
since the gold rush.

01:26.390 --> 01:28.262
Not exactly booming
by the looks of it.

01:28.349 --> 01:30.264
They still get a little
tourism off the highway.

01:30.351 --> 01:32.222
[sniffing]

01:34.833 --> 01:36.705
Smells of juniper.

01:36.792 --> 01:37.967
Cologne?

01:38.054 --> 01:42.363
Uh, I don't..
No. More like..

01:42.450 --> 01:44.016
...cheap gin--

01:44.104 --> 01:45.801
Drunken out of necessity,
not pleasure.

01:45.888 --> 01:48.934
So, he drank alone.
He let the killer in.

01:49.021 --> 01:52.024
He knew him or her.
They argued--

01:52.112 --> 01:53.896
How'd you know they argued?

01:53.983 --> 01:55.985
- Well, heisdead.
- What did they argue about?

01:56.072 --> 01:57.682
Well, I don't know.
What do people argue about?

01:57.769 --> 01:59.641
Money, power,
love, jealousy--

01:59.728 --> 02:02.165
Revenge..
Sorry, I shouldn't do that.

02:02.252 --> 02:04.602
Oh, no. Jump right in.
This is a murder. It's exciting.

02:04.689 --> 02:06.561
What's your guess
on time of death?

02:06.648 --> 02:08.780
Rigor stiffness suggests
12 hours or more.

02:08.867 --> 02:10.304
'Probably that's
your murder weapon.'

02:10.391 --> 02:13.394
It's an antique.
Colt 1851 navy, .36 caliber.

02:13.481 --> 02:14.830
Probably hasn't been fired
in a century.

02:14.917 --> 02:17.833
Right. So, instead,
your guy or gal..

02:17.920 --> 02:19.269
- Whack.
- Whack.

02:19.356 --> 02:21.315
Penetrating trauma
to the back of the skull

02:21.402 --> 02:23.404
was introduced by
the butt of the gun.

02:23.491 --> 02:24.927
Once I pop the calvarium,
I'll know if that's

02:25.014 --> 02:26.233
our official cause of death.

02:26.320 --> 02:27.756
That's great.
Let's pop the calvarium.

02:27.843 --> 02:29.410
[gunshot]
You two hold here.

02:29.497 --> 02:30.846
What is..

02:32.587 --> 02:34.110
- We're gonna hold here.
- Oh, okay.

02:34.197 --> 02:36.504
- They've got this covered.
- Yeah..

02:43.206 --> 02:46.122
[galloping]

02:50.866 --> 02:53.085
[male #1]
'Like I said, folks,
anything can happen here'

02:53.173 --> 02:55.436
in rough 'n' tumble
Percy, California.

02:55.523 --> 02:58.221
Let's-let's have uh-uh,
a big round of applause

02:58.308 --> 03:01.224
for our modern-day
gunslingers here, yeah.

03:01.311 --> 03:03.052
What the hell are you doing?
This is a crime scene.

03:03.139 --> 03:04.401
Don't you know there's
a dead body in there?

03:04.488 --> 03:06.534
These people paid 25 bucks
each in advance.

03:06.621 --> 03:08.231
- They're entitled to a show.
- Well, they got one.

03:08.318 --> 03:10.190
Now shut this down
and clear the area right now.

03:15.325 --> 03:18.198
[instrumental music]

03:25.553 --> 03:26.902
I don't know.

03:26.989 --> 03:29.165
I think that's why
I liked San Francisco.

03:29.252 --> 03:32.342
Yeah, I never saw myself living
in the place I grew up.

03:32.429 --> 03:34.039
You know?

03:34.126 --> 03:35.867
Yeah. I know.

03:41.003 --> 03:42.526
What about you?

03:42.613 --> 03:43.832
Where did you grow up?

03:43.919 --> 03:46.661
Oh, we moved around.

03:46.748 --> 03:49.403
For dad's work,
and then for mom's work.

03:50.839 --> 03:55.191
I like to say
I grew up in America.

03:55.278 --> 03:57.628
Yeah. Yeah.

03:57.715 --> 04:00.327
Um..

04:00.414 --> 04:02.677
I hate to do this,
but I have to run.

04:02.764 --> 04:03.982
We have a fresh case.

04:04.069 --> 04:05.854
Please. I'm glad we were
able to do this.

04:05.941 --> 04:08.335
Sit down like this.

04:08.422 --> 04:10.337
This is nice.

04:10.424 --> 04:12.643
You're really easy
to talk to, Teresa.

04:12.730 --> 04:13.949
Thanks, Bob.

04:15.907 --> 04:18.606
are there any new lines
of inquiry on Red John?

04:18.693 --> 04:21.043
We've had some leads, but..

04:21.130 --> 04:24.612
I hate to admit it,
we're kind of stuck.

04:24.699 --> 04:26.091
Nothing. No.

04:26.178 --> 04:29.094
- What about Jane?
- I don't think he has anything.

04:29.181 --> 04:30.922
But he'd tell you
if he did.

04:31.009 --> 04:33.838
Yeah. Yeah, he would.

04:33.925 --> 04:35.797
Okay. Well, I'm sure
we'll talk.

04:35.884 --> 04:38.103
- Homeland security beckons.
- Okay.

04:46.721 --> 04:48.940
- Is it cold in here?
- Yeah. AC's on the fritz.

04:49.027 --> 04:50.507
It's stuck on cold.
They got someone coming in.

04:50.594 --> 04:53.162
- So I'm not crazy, okay.
- Right.

04:53.249 --> 04:55.730
Percy, California.
Incorporated by J.D. Percy

04:55.817 --> 04:57.384
'as a trading post in 1870.'

04:57.471 --> 04:59.211
Trade dried up, but the Percy
family stayed.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.039
They tried to make it work.

05:01.126 --> 05:02.389
It's basically been a tourist
town for the past 30 years.

05:02.476 --> 05:03.999
But that hasn't been
going too great.

05:04.086 --> 05:06.262
Sorry. It was
a "welcome back" gift.

05:06.349 --> 05:07.655
Very thoughtful, Wayne.

05:07.742 --> 05:09.004
Well, how did you know
it was from me?

05:09.091 --> 05:10.745
I'm a homicide detective.

05:10.832 --> 05:12.442
Now, Hollis Percy
owned every building.

05:12.529 --> 05:13.922
People pay him rent,
and he was the bank.

05:14.009 --> 05:15.967
That property belongs
to his wife, Joanna.

05:16.054 --> 05:17.708
- For a few weeks, anyway.
- Well, why only a few weeks?

05:17.795 --> 05:19.188
He ran out of money.

05:19.275 --> 05:21.190
The wild west show
was a last-ditch chance

05:21.277 --> 05:22.931
to drum up some cash, but now
the whole place is up for sale.

05:23.018 --> 05:24.541
They started selling
property this year.

05:24.628 --> 05:26.282
'Houses, stores..'
People rented for generations'

05:26.369 --> 05:27.327
and now becoming owners.

05:27.414 --> 05:28.415
A lot of money changing hands.

05:28.502 --> 05:29.938
There could be motive there.

05:30.025 --> 05:31.200
Go through all
the real estate transactions

05:31.287 --> 05:32.810
see if anything shakes loose.

05:32.897 --> 05:34.943
- Any usable prints on the gun?
- Doesn't look that way.

05:35.030 --> 05:36.466
Okay. I'm going to go
talk to the family.

05:36.553 --> 05:38.729
Make sure they take care
of this AC today.

05:38.816 --> 05:41.036
- That was it?
- That's all Kirkland said.

05:41.123 --> 05:42.777
He was just fishing.

05:42.864 --> 05:44.169
Don't you think it's odd?

05:44.256 --> 05:45.910
Homeland security's
fascination

05:45.997 --> 05:47.521
with a California
serial killer?

05:47.608 --> 05:49.784
Everything about
Bob Kirkland is odd.

05:49.871 --> 05:51.263
- Well, yes.
- Just add that to the list.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.265
Hello there.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.442
Emmett Cook,
chief of police.

05:55.529 --> 05:57.052
Sorry I couldn't be
at the crime scene.

05:57.139 --> 05:58.488
Yeah, why couldn't
you be there?

05:58.575 --> 05:59.968
Something a little more
pressing than a murder?

06:00.055 --> 06:02.579
I'm Agent Lisbon,
and this is Patrick Jane.

06:02.666 --> 06:05.016
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:05.103 --> 06:06.757
Um, actually,
I couldn't be there

06:06.844 --> 06:08.672
'cause I was dealing
with a fire.

06:08.759 --> 06:11.022
Quite a mess, uh,
third one this year.

06:11.109 --> 06:13.460
These, uh, meth labs guys
are setting up in empty cabins

06:13.547 --> 06:15.940
uh, the things go..

06:16.027 --> 06:18.290
[blows air]
Kablooey.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.511
[blows air]
Kablooey,indeed.
So you've been busy, chief?

06:21.598 --> 06:23.470
Do you think the drug trade
had something to do

06:23.557 --> 06:24.862
with Hollis Percy's murder?

06:24.949 --> 06:26.951
I don't see
the connection. No.

06:27.038 --> 06:29.389
I mean, there could be,
but that would be..

06:29.476 --> 06:30.738
Uh, messy?

06:32.479 --> 06:36.091
- Yes. You could say that.
- I did.

06:36.178 --> 06:39.050
Well, I just wanted
to stop by and let you know

06:39.137 --> 06:41.705
that I am available
if CBI needs my help.

06:41.792 --> 06:45.535
Thank you, b-but that's
kind of a conflict of interest.

06:45.622 --> 06:47.624
You aiding in the investigation
of the murder

06:47.711 --> 06:49.452
of the man
who pays your salary.

06:49.539 --> 06:51.846
Well, plus you've got some
meth dealers to track down.

06:51.933 --> 06:53.978
Yes. Yes, I do.

06:54.065 --> 06:58.069
Well, if you need anything,
just, um..

06:58.156 --> 06:59.506
...shout.

06:59.593 --> 07:01.072
We'll holler.

07:03.335 --> 07:05.033
Very odd little
country welcome.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.122
'You've had no issues,
Mrs. Percy?'

07:07.209 --> 07:11.387
No. There's been no trouble.

07:11.474 --> 07:15.173
The last murder
in Percy was a long time ago.

07:15.260 --> 07:17.741
It's safe here.
We have good schools.

07:17.828 --> 07:21.005
We-we build
riding trails and..

07:21.092 --> 07:23.486
...and Hollis maintained
it all beautifully.

07:23.573 --> 07:25.575
Dad loved this town.

07:25.662 --> 07:27.490
But you don't...Ian?

07:27.577 --> 07:30.928
- Of course he does.
- Yeah, I mean, you know?

07:31.015 --> 07:32.321
Well, it's not
a trick question.

07:32.408 --> 07:33.888
'No, of course.'

07:33.975 --> 07:35.977
I just moved back
to help with the transition.

07:36.064 --> 07:38.501
I was in San Francisco
working venture capital.

07:38.588 --> 07:40.372
It was time to come home.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.853
Was Hollis meeting someone
in his office last night?

07:42.940 --> 07:44.681
We think the attack
took place around 8:00.

07:44.768 --> 07:46.378
Well, it's possible.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.642
He kept a lot of late hours
the past few years.

07:48.729 --> 07:50.513
Yeah, he tried everything..

07:50.600 --> 07:52.776
Talking to investors, developers

07:52.863 --> 07:54.691
but, you know, towns
like this are just dying out.

07:54.778 --> 07:58.086
Mm. Still, he was
a futile lord ruling over

07:58.173 --> 08:01.176
a town of downtrodden serfs.

08:01.263 --> 08:02.743
He must have had someone
that hated him.

08:02.830 --> 08:05.441
He was respected.
Ask anyone.

08:05.528 --> 08:07.487
What about the sale
of the town?

08:07.574 --> 08:08.836
Was there
any friction there?

08:11.099 --> 08:12.927
So he had a few critics.

08:13.014 --> 08:14.406
Could you do me a favor?

08:14.494 --> 08:16.191
Just grab a piece
of paper there, and a pen

08:16.278 --> 08:19.150
and write down the name that
you just thought of just now.

08:19.237 --> 08:21.109
Write it down.
Don't show it to each other.

08:21.196 --> 08:22.327
- 'Why?'
- Please?

08:22.414 --> 08:23.981
[sighs]

08:24.068 --> 08:26.157
[chuckles]

08:26.244 --> 08:27.637
[pen clicks]

08:34.339 --> 08:37.517
Francisco Navarro.

08:37.604 --> 08:39.301
And you had
the same thought.

08:39.388 --> 08:41.695
- Who is Francisco Navarro?
- He runs a wild west show.

08:41.782 --> 08:44.219
He's an old friend
of the family..

08:44.306 --> 08:46.090
...and he didn't think
we should sell.

08:46.177 --> 08:48.919
'Hollis did what
he had to do.'

08:49.006 --> 08:51.835
A bunch of amateurs
playing cowboys and Indians

08:51.922 --> 08:55.230
weren't going to save us no
matter what Francisco believed.

08:55.317 --> 08:56.971
He's pretty dedicated
to this place.

08:57.058 --> 08:59.277
You think he was angry enough
to act on it?

08:59.364 --> 09:01.845
Like I said,
he's dedicated.

09:04.108 --> 09:06.023
[Cho]
'That's a nice jacket,
Mr. Navarro.'

09:08.112 --> 09:09.766
What would you call that..

09:09.853 --> 09:11.072
...a duster?

09:11.159 --> 09:12.334
I'm the medicine man
in the show.

09:12.421 --> 09:13.465
I'm going right there
from here.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.032
Just answer the question.

09:15.119 --> 09:16.512
Yes. It's a duster.

09:18.601 --> 09:19.950
Are you writing that down?

09:20.037 --> 09:21.604
Tell me about
the wild west show.

09:21.691 --> 09:23.650
Our program is a fully
immersive step back

09:23.737 --> 09:26.087
in the 19th century.
I oversee 20 performers.

09:26.174 --> 09:28.045
We run six days a week.
Wednesdays and Fridays

09:28.132 --> 09:29.873
we stage a medicine man show.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.875
[Cho]
'And you're in charge?'

09:31.962 --> 09:33.790
'Which makes this piece
on your blog..'

09:33.877 --> 09:35.662
...kind of odd.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.489
"Killing Percy."

09:37.577 --> 09:39.187
Well, I meant
thetownof Percy

09:39.274 --> 09:41.102
not Hollis Percy, obviously.

09:41.189 --> 09:42.930
- Yeah. That's some bad timing.
- Yes, it is.

09:43.017 --> 09:45.019
It is also
the inalienable right

09:45.106 --> 09:46.673
of every citizen
in the state of California

09:46.760 --> 09:48.413
to freely speak, write,
and publish his sentiments

09:48.500 --> 09:50.459
on all subjects.
I overreacted..

09:50.546 --> 09:51.852
...online.

09:51.939 --> 09:53.767
I would never do harm
to my friend.

09:53.854 --> 09:56.291
- But he wasn't your friend.
- No, he was.

09:59.511 --> 10:03.167
But...when he started
selling property last year..

10:03.254 --> 10:04.691
See, that's just
giving up

10:04.778 --> 10:06.736
on something worth
fighting for. He was weak.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.433
And he couldn't afford
to run the town?

10:08.520 --> 10:09.739
Which meant your show
was gonna get shut down.

10:09.826 --> 10:11.132
Yeah, and what thanks
do I get?

10:11.219 --> 10:13.003
I built our program
to save Percy.

10:13.090 --> 10:14.918
Tourists came,
just not enough.

10:15.005 --> 10:16.267
And then with these cabins
exploding up there in the woods

10:16.354 --> 10:17.704
'it's getting ugly.'

10:17.791 --> 10:19.270
'Where were you last night
at 8:00 P.M.?'

10:19.357 --> 10:21.098
I was in the bar
with some of my actors.

10:21.185 --> 10:22.665
If you're so dialed
into the town

10:22.752 --> 10:24.449
Who else had a beef
with your friend?

10:24.536 --> 10:26.930
I have no idea. Look, I gotta
go. I have a show to put on.

10:27.017 --> 10:28.932
[Cho]
'His alibi relies on the account
of a bunch of drunks.'

10:29.019 --> 10:32.109
Real drunks
or old-timey pioneer drunks

10:32.196 --> 10:33.763
that are getting paid
by the hour?

10:33.850 --> 10:35.460
Well, either way, he could have
left the bar at any point

10:35.547 --> 10:37.593
walked 30 yards to
Hollis' office, and walked out.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.682
Oh, we're heading
to the bar now.

10:39.769 --> 10:41.336
Alright. We're gonna go
meet the police chief.

10:41.423 --> 10:43.425
And then Rigsby wants
to go check out those cabins.

10:43.512 --> 10:46.297
The meth lab fires? Might be
worth looking into, I guess.

10:46.384 --> 10:49.170
Follow close as my magical
and mysterious friend..

10:49.257 --> 10:52.042
Mr. Golden nugget
travels a trail of deception

10:52.129 --> 10:54.262
before your very eyes.
Young man..

10:54.349 --> 10:55.916
under which of these
humble chalices

10:56.003 --> 10:59.441
does the golden nugget
reside?

10:59.528 --> 11:00.747
- That one.
- Hmm?

11:00.834 --> 11:02.270
Ah! A brave Choice,

11:02.357 --> 11:05.012
but sadly,
it's the wrong one.

11:05.099 --> 11:07.623
Hey! Care to wager again?
A buck buys three guesses

11:07.710 --> 11:09.494
but pays 5
if you guess right.

11:09.581 --> 11:11.409
I-I believe
I-I saw your move.

11:11.496 --> 11:13.629
Oh, what have we here..

11:13.716 --> 11:16.588
A skeptic? Please sir,
step right up.

11:16.676 --> 11:17.894
Test my skills.

11:17.981 --> 11:20.070
See if you remain
unconvinced.

11:20.157 --> 11:21.768
- Don't mind if I do. Okay..
- Alright.

11:21.855 --> 11:23.421
So the nugget goes
in the cup like this.

11:23.508 --> 11:24.858
And then we move them
around like this until

11:24.945 --> 11:26.555
I can't tell
which one it's in.

11:26.642 --> 11:28.383
Then you continue doing that,
but then to do this

11:28.470 --> 11:29.863
don't you need to have
a gold nugget?

11:29.950 --> 11:31.038
Oh.

11:34.084 --> 11:36.043
I believe I saw
your move there, friend.

11:36.130 --> 11:37.958
- You did, did you?
- Mm-hmm. You won't mind?

11:38.045 --> 11:39.307
Not at all.
Not one little bit.

11:39.394 --> 11:40.482
- Uh, now, come on.
- What?

11:40.569 --> 11:42.397
- You know I felt that.
- Felt what?

11:42.484 --> 11:44.660
- My wallet, please.
- I beg your pardon?

11:44.747 --> 11:47.576
- Sir.
- I-I mean, this?

11:47.663 --> 11:49.839
- Oh, this. Is this it?
- Mm-hmm.

11:49.926 --> 11:51.449
I've never seen that
in my life.

11:51.536 --> 11:52.886
So you're schooled
in the craft?

11:52.973 --> 11:54.496
Yeah, I used to be.
I'm a little rusty.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.019
But you know what?
Worth a shot.

11:57.717 --> 11:58.805
[cups clanking]
Wait a minute!

11:58.892 --> 12:00.284
- What?
- Where's my gold?

12:00.371 --> 12:01.590
I don't know
what you're talking about.

12:01.677 --> 12:03.592
Bro, that thing is real.

12:03.679 --> 12:05.899
Alright, sir. We will
get you your gold back.

12:05.986 --> 12:07.248
- Jane.
- I don't have your gold.

12:07.335 --> 12:08.728
Maybe the kid
can enlighten you.

12:08.815 --> 12:09.816
The ki..

12:16.170 --> 12:17.562
Mm-hmm.

12:17.649 --> 12:19.782
Here we go, Lisbon..

12:19.869 --> 12:21.175
[whispers]
...gossip.

12:23.568 --> 12:26.833
Two sarsaparillas, please.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.139
Sure I can't
Irishthose up for ya?

12:29.226 --> 12:31.968
Oh, would that I could,
but we're on the job.

12:32.055 --> 12:35.319
Oh. Are you guys
here about the murder?

12:35.406 --> 12:37.278
I mean, not that
you stand out

12:37.365 --> 12:38.627
in your suits
or anything..

12:38.714 --> 12:40.237
We're with the CBI.

12:40.324 --> 12:43.371
Yes. Um,
can I ask you..

12:43.458 --> 12:45.895
...do they let you use
your real name in this shop?

12:45.982 --> 12:48.985
I guess.
Um, I'm Lily...Soto.

12:49.072 --> 12:50.421
You looked a little
spooked just then.

12:50.508 --> 12:52.249
- Did you know Hollis?
- Barely.

12:52.336 --> 12:55.383
I grew up in Jasper,
in the valley.

12:55.470 --> 12:57.907
He interviewed me for this job
like a year ago.

12:57.994 --> 12:59.517
Did his employees
like him?

12:59.604 --> 13:03.391
Yeah. Yeah, I mean,
he tips us out at Christmas.

13:03.478 --> 13:05.088
He's generous..

13:05.175 --> 13:06.873
...too much, probably.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.353
Well, I imagine that
some people bad-mouth him

13:09.440 --> 13:11.965
once the booze starts to flow.

13:12.052 --> 13:14.141
Oh. I mean, you know,
people talk.

13:14.228 --> 13:16.056
Some people weren't happy

13:16.143 --> 13:17.535
with the way he was
running the town.

13:17.622 --> 13:19.276
He kept this place going.

13:19.363 --> 13:22.497
Yeah, but it's-it's been
getting bad for a while.

13:22.584 --> 13:24.891
Rumor is there's a mall
moving in.

13:24.978 --> 13:26.544
Like, wow, right? But..

13:26.631 --> 13:28.677
...people are freaking out
about these meth labs.

13:28.764 --> 13:30.113
Some friends were gonna
buy the bar

13:30.200 --> 13:32.289
but everybody's moving away.

13:32.376 --> 13:35.292
Francisco Navarro, was he here
last night at 8:00 P.M.?

13:35.379 --> 13:38.034
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, he's pretty
much here every night.

13:38.121 --> 13:39.775
You would be, too,
if you drank for free.

13:39.862 --> 13:42.343
Mm-hmm. Is that on?

13:42.430 --> 13:45.433
[scoffs]
Probably not since disco.

13:48.610 --> 13:51.308
Hollis Percy overpaid
his workers.

13:51.395 --> 13:54.834
He hired three bartenders
when two would suffice.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.444
And yet he's dead.

13:56.531 --> 13:58.663
So, do you think
his generosity got him killed?

13:58.750 --> 14:01.405
I just think it's odd
that such a swell guy

14:01.492 --> 14:03.712
felt compelled to pay
for loyalty.

14:07.716 --> 14:09.544
So the police have no
surveillance footage..

14:09.631 --> 14:11.502
- ...on main street.
- Nope.

14:11.589 --> 14:14.288
And we follow up by driving
out to the woods. Why?

14:18.379 --> 14:19.554
Timing.

14:21.121 --> 14:23.471
An explosion the night
before a murder..

14:23.558 --> 14:25.299
...doesn't that seem
suspicious to you?

14:27.649 --> 14:29.651
Not really. They're meth labs.
They explode.

14:29.738 --> 14:31.435
Well, let me ask you this.

14:31.522 --> 14:34.917
Doesn't something look
offhere?

14:35.004 --> 14:36.397
Yeah, everything's burned.

14:36.484 --> 14:38.442
Yeah, but this is not
completely torched.

14:40.444 --> 14:41.881
- Feel that.
- I'm good.

14:41.968 --> 14:44.318
It feels like
a flame-retardant gel.

14:44.405 --> 14:46.798
That's why some of this
stuff here survived.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.235
Before this place
burned down

14:48.322 --> 14:49.976
someone,
someone sprayed it down

14:50.063 --> 14:52.021
so that the flames wouldn't
spread into a forest fire.

14:52.108 --> 14:53.718
- So this wasn't an accident?
- No.

14:53.805 --> 14:57.070
Okay.
Then, what was it?

14:57.157 --> 14:58.810
So you think it was arson?

14:58.898 --> 15:00.638
Maybe it was a rival gang
trying to make a point

15:00.725 --> 15:01.944
like a territorial thing.

15:02.031 --> 15:03.293
Yeah, but what kind
of drug dealer

15:03.380 --> 15:05.078
sprays the place down
for safety?

15:05.165 --> 15:06.775
I don't know.

15:06.862 --> 15:09.169
There might be a connection
to Hollis' murder here.

15:09.256 --> 15:10.910
It's weird. It's almost
as if someone

15:10.997 --> 15:12.824
mocked these places up to make
them look like meth labs.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.609
Okay, you and Cho
look into it.

15:19.788 --> 15:21.485
[engine turns off]

15:34.411 --> 15:35.935
[tools rattling]

15:39.895 --> 15:41.505
We're at the door.
30 seconds till we're in.

15:41.592 --> 15:42.942
[lock clicks]

15:47.468 --> 15:48.469
[door thuds]

15:50.036 --> 15:51.124
[toolbox latches click]

16:14.886 --> 16:16.932
Go ahead. Say it.

16:17.019 --> 16:20.718
Then you're supposed
to say, "say what?"

16:20.805 --> 16:23.243
And then I say,
"you think I'm an idiot..

16:23.330 --> 16:24.809
for buying Van Pelt
that orchid."

16:24.896 --> 16:27.334
You know what?
I'm glad I did.

16:27.421 --> 16:28.988
'Cause now the ball's
in her court.

16:29.075 --> 16:31.512
I'm gonna be so Zen
about this.

16:31.599 --> 16:33.514
Yep, the next move's hers.

16:33.601 --> 16:36.691
I'm just gonna be the reed
that bends in the breeze.

16:36.778 --> 16:38.388
You're still
in love with her.

16:38.475 --> 16:39.999
But instead of telling her,
you bought her a plant.

16:42.175 --> 16:43.872
Yeah, that's pretty
Zen, though. Right?

16:43.959 --> 16:45.917
Hey, fellas, we're
gonna need this space.

16:47.832 --> 16:49.269
How long are you boys
going to be fiddling

16:49.356 --> 16:51.271
with those newfangled
contraptions there?

16:51.358 --> 16:53.273
CBI arson unit, sir.
We'll be done shortly.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.014
[sighs]

16:55.101 --> 16:57.364
Look, Mr. Navarro's
kicking my butt.

16:57.451 --> 16:59.018
Trying to get the show
back up here.

16:59.105 --> 17:00.889
We've been shut down
all day.

17:00.976 --> 17:04.197
Hi. I'm Ian Percy.
I'm in charge here.

17:04.284 --> 17:05.894
'Are you gentlemen
with the CBI?'

17:05.981 --> 17:08.636
Yes, Mr. Percy. I'm agent Cho.
This is agent Rigsby.

17:08.723 --> 17:10.290
- CBI arson unit.
- Arson unit?

17:10.377 --> 17:12.161
We're driving up
to check out those cabin fires.

17:12.248 --> 17:13.945
Hitting it bright and early
tomorrow morning.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.470
Oh, it's arson, you think?
Isn't that..

17:16.557 --> 17:18.907
Wasn't it supposed to be some
crystal meth mishap?

17:18.994 --> 17:21.040
Well, fortunately
it didn't all burn down.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.476
Once we get the chemical
signature of the burn

17:22.563 --> 17:23.999
we can tell if someone
torched it.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.435
'We'll find our bad guy
pretty quick after that.

17:25.522 --> 17:27.307
Let me know if you
need anything from me.

17:27.394 --> 17:29.048
In the meantime,
I'll let you get back to it.

17:44.976 --> 17:47.675
[gasoline splashing]

17:49.242 --> 17:51.679
- Hello, chief.
- You got no case.

17:51.766 --> 17:53.115
You're wasting your time.

17:54.638 --> 17:58.033
So, you saw me carrying
a gas can. Big deal.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.600
Besides, you didn't
even take

17:59.687 --> 18:01.210
your fancy equipment
out of the truck.

18:01.297 --> 18:02.603
[Cho]
Yeah, there was no
fancy equipment.

18:02.690 --> 18:04.605
Just your guilty conscience.

18:04.692 --> 18:06.259
Want something to drink?

18:06.346 --> 18:07.956
It's a long drive
back to Sacramento.

18:08.043 --> 18:11.133
- 'You look cozy there, chief.'
- He knows how this goes.

18:11.220 --> 18:12.961
He's a cop.

18:13.048 --> 18:14.658
'And you're a crook,
too, right?'

18:14.745 --> 18:17.531
That's why you built these phony
meth labs? Burned 'em down?

18:17.618 --> 18:20.011
And you were trying
to scare people away.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.275
Drive down prices
and buy property on the cheap.

18:22.362 --> 18:25.408
[sighs]
Look..

18:25.495 --> 18:29.151
...even if I did set
a couple cabins on fire..

18:29.238 --> 18:31.153
...so what?

18:31.240 --> 18:33.112
Maybe I like fires.

18:33.199 --> 18:35.244
Listen, Emmett..

18:35.331 --> 18:36.811
...this isn't hypothetical.

18:36.898 --> 18:38.900
Right now you're our prime
suspect in this murder case.

18:38.987 --> 18:40.597
You know what to do.

18:40.684 --> 18:42.556
You don't want to be wrapped up
in a murder investigation.

18:42.643 --> 18:43.731
Help yourself out.

18:46.473 --> 18:49.389
Alright, look, um, the thing
is in about three to four years

18:49.476 --> 18:50.477
a new outlet mall
is going to open here..

18:50.564 --> 18:52.522
...uh, next to Percy.

18:52.609 --> 18:54.959
So I figure I could
hold onto the land till then.

18:55.046 --> 18:57.179
Then... dump it?

18:57.266 --> 18:59.442
But Hollis figured it out?
And he confronted you?

18:59.529 --> 19:02.532
- No. Hollis was clueless.
- So what did happen?

19:02.619 --> 19:04.534
My colleague here
thinks you killed him.

19:04.621 --> 19:06.275
So far I can't tell
if you have the stones.

19:06.362 --> 19:07.885
No-no. No, guys..

19:07.972 --> 19:12.020
[chuckles]
Guys, I'm-

19:12.107 --> 19:15.415
Hollis didn't suspect
a thing, I'm telling you.

19:15.502 --> 19:18.157
He was just some
rich...weirdo.

19:18.244 --> 19:20.550
- They both are.
- They? Who's they? The son?

19:20.637 --> 19:22.944
Joanna...his wife.

19:23.031 --> 19:24.859
Uh, two weeks ago,
I get a call to the house

19:24.946 --> 19:26.513
the neighbor heard
some screaming.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.297
He was drunk.

19:28.384 --> 19:31.126
And she was out of control.

19:31.213 --> 19:32.258
Shrieking.

19:34.216 --> 19:36.697
Shrieking? About what?

19:43.965 --> 19:45.619
[exhales]

19:45.706 --> 19:47.925
Jane made a lot
of Red John connections here.

19:48.012 --> 19:50.101
It looks like he's building
his own time line.

19:50.189 --> 19:53.757
'It's all on the drive. We
printed out some greatest hits.'

19:53.844 --> 19:55.498
This is good.

19:55.585 --> 19:56.673
We could log it
into the system.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.022
Not necessary.

19:58.109 --> 20:00.199
So you'll just...
take it from here?

20:00.286 --> 20:01.461
I will.

20:14.343 --> 20:16.519
He was sober for 20 years.

20:16.606 --> 20:18.434
A month ago, he fell
off the wagon

20:18.521 --> 20:20.088
and he could be
a mean drunk.

20:20.175 --> 20:21.437
Did he hit you?

20:23.265 --> 20:24.440
- No.
- No?

20:26.312 --> 20:28.749
Okay.

20:28.836 --> 20:30.577
What could have caused him
to start drinking again?

20:30.664 --> 20:31.969
Well, he had his triggers.

20:32.056 --> 20:33.623
But his father's been dead
a long time.

20:33.710 --> 20:36.017
Were there
romantic problems?

20:36.104 --> 20:37.671
You're sweet.

20:40.674 --> 20:42.545
You mean, was Hollis
sleeping around?

20:42.632 --> 20:45.113
Or maybe you found out.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.071
Maybe you argued,
and he was drunk

20:47.158 --> 20:49.422
and things got
out of control.

20:49.509 --> 20:52.468
Hollis used to run around.

20:52.555 --> 20:53.861
He was fun.

20:55.732 --> 20:57.865
Too much fun.

20:57.952 --> 20:59.867
But he grew to be
faithful.

21:01.129 --> 21:02.870
He was terrified
of change.

21:04.567 --> 21:07.266
A wife knows.

21:07.353 --> 21:08.702
If you were married,
you'd understand

21:08.789 --> 21:10.356
what I was talking about.

21:13.141 --> 21:15.012
Are you married,
agent Van Pelt?

21:15.099 --> 21:17.188
Not yet.
Sounds like fun.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.451
Mm.

21:18.538 --> 21:19.713
I like the police chief
for the murder.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.018
'He's a weasel.'

21:21.105 --> 21:22.803
Real estate records show
that cook and some

21:22.890 --> 21:25.153
poorly rigged holding company
bought properties in town.

21:25.240 --> 21:27.460
He had a lot to lose
if Hollis exposed his scam.

21:27.547 --> 21:28.852
[Patrick]
'Juicy stuff.'

21:28.939 --> 21:30.419
You have him pegged right
as a weasel

21:30.506 --> 21:31.899
but I don't think
he's a killer.

21:31.986 --> 21:33.640
I think Joanna hides
it well, but Hollis

21:33.727 --> 21:34.858
may have been abusive.

21:34.945 --> 21:36.295
You're thinking
self defense.

21:36.382 --> 21:38.601
There is one vexing detail
still missing.

21:38.688 --> 21:42.692
Something in Hollis' life
changed a month ago.

21:42.779 --> 21:44.041
You mean, to get him
drinking again.

21:44.128 --> 21:45.434
'Yeah, exactly. Something.'

21:45.521 --> 21:46.783
We have to figure out
what it was.

21:46.870 --> 21:48.002
Okay. How?

21:48.089 --> 21:49.917
Well, Joanna has no idea

21:50.004 --> 21:53.094
or she has no inclination to
tell us. Nor does anyone else.

21:53.181 --> 21:56.489
Maybe something in his past
re-emerged.

21:56.576 --> 21:59.448
- That's thin.
- Yeah. That is thin.

21:59.535 --> 22:02.059
But you have
to start somewhere.

22:02.146 --> 22:05.498
Hmm. Beautiful orchid, Grace.
Well Chosen, Rigsby.

22:26.649 --> 22:30.523
Hey. Set you up with
another sarsaparilla?

22:30.610 --> 22:33.743
- On the house?
- 'Ah. Who'd say no to that?'

22:33.830 --> 22:37.225
I'm gonna get going.
Agent Jane.

22:37.312 --> 22:39.140
- See you around.
- Sure thing, Mr. Percy.

22:39.227 --> 22:41.098
Mr. Percy? Very formal.

22:41.185 --> 22:44.841
Uh, well, you know,
it pays to kiss the ring.

22:44.928 --> 22:47.931
So, you cracked
your case yet?

22:48.018 --> 22:50.107
Cracked, uh, mm..

22:50.194 --> 22:51.892
...not likely. No.

22:51.979 --> 22:54.721
Uh, when does Francisco
usually show up here?

22:54.808 --> 22:57.332
He should be here soon.

22:57.419 --> 22:59.943
I heard you clowned
Kevin pretty good.

23:00.030 --> 23:02.076
Kevin. The magician.

23:02.163 --> 23:05.296
Oh, him. Yes.
Wouldn't call him a magician.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.560
Normally has to be
magic involved.

23:07.647 --> 23:09.257
[chuckles]
Yeah.

23:09.344 --> 23:10.998
I hear you got real powers.

23:11.085 --> 23:14.001
No, just a little mind reading
and predictions, that's all.

23:14.088 --> 23:15.785
Show me.

23:15.872 --> 23:18.092
Please?

23:18.179 --> 23:19.572
Okay.

23:19.659 --> 23:20.834
How about I tell you
what you're gonna have

23:20.921 --> 23:22.313
for breakfast tomorrow
morning?

23:22.401 --> 23:23.706
Okay.

23:23.793 --> 23:26.840
I'm gonna need a pen,
paper, and an envelope.

23:30.321 --> 23:32.323
Mm.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.804
- Tasty.
- Voila.

23:34.891 --> 23:36.110
'Thank you.'

23:36.197 --> 23:38.329
Close your eyes.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.375
I want you to imagine
being in your kitchen

23:40.462 --> 23:41.811
tomorrow morning.

23:41.898 --> 23:44.118
This is what I like
about tending bar

23:44.205 --> 23:45.641
you meet all kinds.

23:45.728 --> 23:48.427
Visualize yourself..

23:48.514 --> 23:50.167
...looking into the cupboard..

23:52.474 --> 23:53.780
...looking at all the items

23:53.867 --> 23:55.956
thinking about
what you're gonna eat.

23:56.043 --> 23:58.654
'And then you Choose
which one you want.'

23:58.741 --> 24:00.351
- You got it?
- Yeah.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.005
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

24:03.833 --> 24:05.444
Okay.

24:10.318 --> 24:12.102
'Done.'

24:12.189 --> 24:15.192
Put it somewhere safe. We'll
open it tomorrow. No peeking.

24:15.279 --> 24:16.890
Oh, I wouldn't
dream of it.

24:16.977 --> 24:19.283
[Francisco]
'Barmaid!'

24:19.370 --> 24:21.242
Shot of whiskey
and a beer back.

24:25.725 --> 24:28.597
[indistinct conversations]

24:32.688 --> 24:34.647
- What do you need?
- Backup.

24:34.734 --> 24:36.039
I don't like it
when you say you need backup

24:36.126 --> 24:37.476
and nothing's happened yet.

24:37.563 --> 24:39.303
Nothing to worry about.
We're just here to talk.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.266
Uh, do you mind?

24:48.748 --> 24:50.880
Oh, she didn't have
to go anywhere.

24:52.360 --> 24:55.015
I already said my piece,
but go ahead.

24:55.102 --> 24:57.321
Well, we're interested
in ancient history

24:57.408 --> 24:58.627
which seems to be
your department

24:58.714 --> 25:00.760
so it's obvious
that we start with you.

25:00.847 --> 25:03.414
We want to know about
Hollis Percy's drinking.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.199
Well, he used to drink
and then he stopped.

25:05.286 --> 25:08.028
Then he started again.
You have any idea why?

25:08.115 --> 25:10.944
Well, who knows what drives
any other man?

25:11.031 --> 25:12.467
Mr. Navarro,
answer the question.

25:12.554 --> 25:14.121
Let's try this another way.

25:14.208 --> 25:15.557
Y-you and Hollis used
to knock around together

25:15.644 --> 25:17.167
you're lifelong buddies, huh?

25:17.254 --> 25:18.865
Yeah, we used to have
some fun.

25:18.952 --> 25:20.475
Well, it seems there was
nothing in his current life

25:20.562 --> 25:22.521
that would drive him
to drink, so I am guessing

25:22.608 --> 25:24.392
it was something from
his old life

25:24.479 --> 25:25.959
that came out
out of the woodwork.

25:26.046 --> 25:29.789
Orsomeone.Tell me,
how far off am I?

25:34.315 --> 25:36.099
No idea what you're
talking about.

25:36.186 --> 25:38.362
Mm. Really?

25:38.449 --> 25:40.408
You know what
I find sad?

25:40.495 --> 25:43.237
The way you're so tucked
in the Percy family pocket.

25:43.324 --> 25:46.109
- Tucked in their pocket?
- Yeah. Like a soiled hankie.

25:48.459 --> 25:49.809
[male #2]
'You got a problem here, boss?'

25:49.896 --> 25:52.289
- No. No problem.
- No, we're-we're fine.

25:52.376 --> 25:54.248
Okay? We're good?

25:54.335 --> 25:56.250
You are hiding information
from the police, though

25:56.337 --> 25:57.512
which is a crime.

25:57.599 --> 25:58.818
Why would I do that?

25:58.905 --> 26:00.384
Well, possibly
to protect yourself

26:00.471 --> 26:02.778
by protecting Hollis Percy.
I'm not sure.

26:02.865 --> 26:04.824
- What's he talking about?
- He doesn't know.

26:04.911 --> 26:06.260
Yes, but you do.

26:06.347 --> 26:08.392
You talk a big game
about fighting for this town

26:08.479 --> 26:09.916
fighting for the staff.
But the truth is

26:10.003 --> 26:12.179
you sold out to Hollis
a long time ago.

26:12.266 --> 26:14.094
So long ago, you probably
thought he was your friend

26:14.181 --> 26:16.400
which is not sad,
that's just stupid.

26:16.487 --> 26:17.967
You son of a bitch!

26:20.187 --> 26:21.971
Maybe we got a problem.

26:23.930 --> 26:25.801
Is this part of the show?

26:25.888 --> 26:27.237
No.

26:38.597 --> 26:42.383
He could have asked nicely,
that's all I was saying.

26:42.470 --> 26:44.951
I was there.
You want more coffee?

26:45.038 --> 26:47.301
'No, I'm good.'

26:47.388 --> 26:49.564
And Jane thinks you know
who came after Hollis Percy.

26:49.651 --> 26:52.611
[chuckles]
Based on what, precisely?

26:52.698 --> 26:54.656
Well, we don't need
to be precise. You do.

26:54.743 --> 26:57.093
Okay.

26:57.180 --> 26:59.443
Yeah, we got into some
trouble when we were kids.

26:59.530 --> 27:02.011
Hollis got involved
with this one crazy girl

27:02.098 --> 27:05.058
townie from a few miles
up the road.

27:05.145 --> 27:07.843
She was pretty.

27:07.930 --> 27:10.411
This was right after
he married Joanna.

27:10.498 --> 27:12.282
He do that a lot?

27:12.369 --> 27:13.849
Slumming it
with the local girls?

27:13.936 --> 27:16.678
Yeah, he did.
But this girl got pregnant.

27:16.765 --> 27:21.378
And Hollis paid her to...
to deal with it.

27:21.465 --> 27:23.206
Her brother found out

27:23.293 --> 27:24.730
uh, her brother was
bad news.

27:24.817 --> 27:26.601
He roughed up Hollis
pretty thoroughly.

27:26.688 --> 27:28.211
And the brother held
a grudge this whole time.

27:28.298 --> 27:30.257
Yeah, he might have.
He was in prison for 12 years.

27:30.344 --> 27:32.085
He got out a month ago.

27:32.172 --> 27:33.782
I thought maybe he came looking
for a handout from Hollis.

27:33.869 --> 27:35.523
The rich guy
he had dirt on.

27:35.610 --> 27:37.220
- Something like that.
- What happened to the girl?

27:37.307 --> 27:38.526
Well, we heard
she went back home.

27:38.613 --> 27:39.962
This was 30 years ago.

27:42.486 --> 27:44.750
Hollis was a mess.

27:44.837 --> 27:47.666
His dad found out.
Almost disowned him.

27:47.753 --> 27:49.711
Poor guy.

27:49.798 --> 27:54.063
Yes, we had
a falling out, but..

27:54.150 --> 27:55.935
...Hollis was always
my friend.

27:56.022 --> 27:57.850
And Ian, he had no idea.
He's a good kid.

27:57.937 --> 27:59.112
And you may have given
your friend's killer

27:59.199 --> 28:00.896
a two day head start.

28:00.983 --> 28:02.681
I need to know
the guy's name.

28:02.768 --> 28:05.335
The brother.

28:05.422 --> 28:07.860
Flores. Dominic Flores.

28:53.514 --> 28:56.299
[footsteps approaching]

28:56.386 --> 28:57.866
[Cho]
'You gonna touch
all of them?'

28:57.953 --> 28:59.781
Haven't touched that one.

28:59.868 --> 29:02.088
- I'm looking for poppy.
- Lisbon took it.

29:02.175 --> 29:03.698
If you want poppy,
grab the everything bagel.

29:03.785 --> 29:05.395
Yeah, but it has all that
other stuff on it.

29:05.482 --> 29:07.876
Like those onion scraps, I mean,
what are the point of those?

29:07.963 --> 29:09.704
- All you see are problems.
- All I see are bagels.

29:09.791 --> 29:11.750
Just make a Choice.

29:11.837 --> 29:13.969
[rustles bagels]

29:21.150 --> 29:22.282
[whispers]
Great.

29:27.417 --> 29:29.028
Where are we with the brother?

29:29.115 --> 29:31.073
- Hollis' old buddy?
- Oh, you mean Dominic Flores?

29:31.160 --> 29:33.206
He's fresh out of Folsom
serving 12 years and 7 weeks

29:33.293 --> 29:34.598
for robbing,
what did it say?

29:34.685 --> 29:36.513
Sixteen jewelry stores
and a pet shop.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.254
Yeah. He stole
a boa constrictor.

29:38.341 --> 29:39.516
Of course he did.

29:39.603 --> 29:40.996
He was released
a month ago.

29:41.083 --> 29:42.737
His parole officer
says he's been diligent.

29:42.824 --> 29:45.305
But the night of the murder he
was at a job fair in Sacramento.

29:45.392 --> 29:47.176
The coroner puts
the attack at 8:00 P.M.

29:47.263 --> 29:48.438
He couldn't have been
both places.

29:48.525 --> 29:50.092
I don't think so.

29:50.179 --> 29:51.615
I spoke to a guy who
had a booth at the job fair

29:51.702 --> 29:53.356
'a solar panel company.'

29:53.443 --> 29:55.184
He said Dominic signed in
for an interview at 7:45.

29:55.271 --> 29:57.926
Okay. What about
the sister, Juliana?

29:58.013 --> 29:59.362
Still looking. She bounced
around for a bit

29:59.449 --> 30:00.799
then fell out of touch
with the family.

30:00.886 --> 30:02.670
So it's possible
Dominic got out

30:02.757 --> 30:04.063
and paid Hollis
an awkward visit.

30:04.150 --> 30:05.368
That might explain
his drinking

30:05.455 --> 30:06.892
but it doesn't explain
his murder.

30:06.979 --> 30:08.545
We should ask Joanna
if she knew

30:08.632 --> 30:09.938
about the pregnancy
after the show.

30:10.025 --> 30:11.461
What do you mean?

30:11.548 --> 30:13.115
Jane says we need to go
to the "medicine man" show

30:13.202 --> 30:14.203
obviously..

30:14.290 --> 30:16.118
'Rigsby, you want to drive?'

30:16.205 --> 30:18.033
As long as I'm not
called up to volunteer

30:18.120 --> 30:19.121
Sure.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.307
- Ah, Kevin.
- You again.

30:31.394 --> 30:33.527
You know, I-I'm afraid
we got off on the wrong foot

30:33.614 --> 30:35.790
and you need my help,
I need your help.

30:35.877 --> 30:37.748
Maybe we can come to some
kind of agreement.

30:37.836 --> 30:40.273
- Why do I need your help?
- Your magic sucks eggs.

30:40.360 --> 30:43.058
I can help you with that,
and you can help me in return

30:43.145 --> 30:45.191
by giving me a couple of minutes
of your stage time.

30:45.278 --> 30:48.150
Sucks eggs, huh?

30:48.237 --> 30:50.761
- Pick a card. I won't look.
- Alright.

30:53.677 --> 30:55.592
- Pick what card?
- You took my cards.

30:55.679 --> 30:57.159
I don't know what
you're talking about.

30:57.246 --> 30:59.074
Give me back my cards.

30:59.161 --> 31:00.728
Hey, hey, hey, Kevin, Kevin,
let's modulate the attitude.

31:00.815 --> 31:02.164
What's the problem?

31:02.251 --> 31:04.079
'This guy is trying
to get in my head.'

31:04.166 --> 31:06.603
He's trying to ruin my act.
He stole my cards.

31:06.690 --> 31:09.432
Kevin, that's not true.
I-I think you should cool down

31:09.519 --> 31:10.956
before you go anywhere
near an audience.

31:11.043 --> 31:12.522
Stop playing with me.

31:12.609 --> 31:14.437
Mr. Jane, maybe you'd be
better off taking your seat.

31:14.524 --> 31:16.352
- I can handle this.
- Sure, I'd appreciate that.

31:16.439 --> 31:17.745
He's a little scary.

31:17.832 --> 31:19.616
Oh, you're gonna handle it,
Francisco?

31:19.703 --> 31:22.271
Handle this. I quit.

31:22.358 --> 31:23.794
Here you go.

31:23.882 --> 31:26.232
Candy-ass pickpocket
tryin' to bust my Chops.

31:26.319 --> 31:28.364
- Nobody handles me.
- What did you do?

31:28.451 --> 31:29.888
Who's he calling
a candy-ass?

31:29.975 --> 31:32.847
Well, now I have
no magic show. Thank you.

31:32.934 --> 31:33.892
- That's great--
- I know magic.

31:33.979 --> 31:34.980
- Yeah?
- Yes.

31:35.067 --> 31:36.329
What's your favorite number?

31:36.416 --> 31:37.852
Uh, 23.

31:37.939 --> 31:39.288
[chuckles]
Really?

31:39.375 --> 31:40.594
Check that pocket, there.

31:43.640 --> 31:45.860
- How'd you do that?
- Do I get the gig?

31:45.947 --> 31:48.645
[laughs]
Hell, yeah!

31:48.732 --> 31:49.995
[both laugh]

31:55.609 --> 31:56.871
So what is it
that Jane's gonna do?

31:56.958 --> 31:59.482
- No idea.
- Really?

31:59.569 --> 32:03.965
Sometimes it's best just to be
relaxed about this stuff.

32:04.052 --> 32:06.533
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen

32:06.620 --> 32:08.709
and cowboys, too.

32:08.796 --> 32:11.190
Now, you all are in for
a frontier treat

32:11.277 --> 32:13.975
that will mesmerize and amaze.

32:14.062 --> 32:16.804
I'm proud to present to you
the daring work

32:16.891 --> 32:21.069
of magician and mental mystic,
Patrick Jane!

32:21.156 --> 32:22.462
Let's hear it for him!

32:27.554 --> 32:31.819
Thank you, Doc Navarro.
Very impressive introduction.

32:31.906 --> 32:34.213
'I hope I don't disappoint.'

32:34.300 --> 32:37.259
Some people say
I have special powers.

32:37.346 --> 32:39.827
It's not true.
Everyone can read minds.

32:39.914 --> 32:42.221
I can just do it
marginally better than most

32:42.308 --> 32:45.267
that's all. I'm gonna need...
some volunteers

32:45.354 --> 32:48.096
for my first effect.
I-I don't call them tricks

32:48.183 --> 32:50.098
because I think tricks are mean,
and what we're here to do

32:50.185 --> 32:51.708
is to have some fun.

32:51.795 --> 32:53.841
What about you two lovebirds
over there?

32:53.928 --> 32:55.408
- You here on your honeymoon?
- Uh, no.

32:55.495 --> 32:57.976
We're just-just passing
through. We got an RV.

32:58.063 --> 32:59.978
Oh, great. Don't tell me
where you're from.

33:00.065 --> 33:03.285
But here, we're gonna start
real simple.

33:03.372 --> 33:06.027
I'm gonna tell you the town
that you folks left from

33:06.114 --> 33:07.855
and the town that you folks
are headed to.

33:07.942 --> 33:10.205
Just write it down there on that
there piece of paper.

33:10.292 --> 33:12.903
'And as you do it,
imagine them.'

33:12.991 --> 33:16.385
Imagine yourself pulling
out of the driveway.

33:16.472 --> 33:19.258
Lily Soto. You look like
you should be up here

33:19.345 --> 33:20.868
being my assistant.
Ladies and gentlemen

33:20.955 --> 33:22.304
Lily Soto.

33:22.391 --> 33:24.263
[applause]

33:27.222 --> 33:29.268
Okay, now I said that
I would discover the town

33:29.355 --> 33:30.921
that you folks are from,
and the town that you folks

33:31.009 --> 33:33.533
are headed to.

33:33.620 --> 33:37.232
I believe you started out
in Albuquerque...

33:37.319 --> 33:40.888
and you are headed to..
To Seattle, Washington.

33:42.542 --> 33:44.022
[Patrick]
'How'd I do, Lily?'

33:44.109 --> 33:46.459
[chuckles]
"Albuquerque and Seattle."

33:49.027 --> 33:51.072
Thank you very much for your
help. You can take a seat.

33:51.159 --> 33:54.380
Lily...I'm not done
with you yet.

33:54.467 --> 33:56.208
You have to stay up here
and help me.

33:56.295 --> 33:57.774
I wrote down a prediction
yesterday

33:57.861 --> 33:59.037
and I gave it to you, yes?

33:59.124 --> 34:00.777
- You did.
- Yes.

34:00.864 --> 34:02.431
- Did you peek at it?
- No, I didn't peek at it.

34:02.518 --> 34:03.954
- Are you sure?
- I am positive.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.305
- No little peeky peeks?
- No peeks.

34:06.392 --> 34:08.959
'And what did I say
I'd predict?'

34:09.047 --> 34:10.918
Uh, what I had
for breakfast this morning.

34:12.659 --> 34:14.400
Okay. That is impossible.

34:14.487 --> 34:18.882
Uh, and I have to admit...
I told a little white lie.

34:18.969 --> 34:20.928
That isnotwhat
I wrote down.

34:21.015 --> 34:23.539
In fact, what I wrote down..

34:23.626 --> 34:25.846
was the name
of Hollis Percy's killer.

34:25.933 --> 34:28.675
'That's right. Yes.'

34:28.762 --> 34:31.286
I have an envelope, too.

34:31.373 --> 34:33.680
'And inside this envelope..'

34:33.767 --> 34:36.900
I wrote down the reason
for this brutal murder.

34:36.987 --> 34:39.120
The motive, if you will.

34:39.207 --> 34:43.037
Now, Lily, if you would
please open your envelope

34:43.124 --> 34:44.604
and read out that name.

34:46.084 --> 34:47.259
I..
Do I have to?

34:47.346 --> 34:48.564
I'm afraid you do.

34:53.134 --> 34:54.744
Ian Percy.

34:54.831 --> 34:57.095
Okay, Mr. Jane,
that's quite enough.

34:57.182 --> 34:59.314
Alright, this is insane.
Did you put him up to this?

34:59.401 --> 35:01.229
- Why would I do that?
- Why, indeed?

35:01.316 --> 35:04.363
Be-because he wants
to get rid of me? I don't know.

35:04.450 --> 35:05.842
He's trying to frame me.

35:05.929 --> 35:08.062
Well, i-if he's lying,
then-then..

35:08.149 --> 35:11.109
you wouldn't object
to Lily opening up this envelope

35:11.196 --> 35:12.980
and reading what's inside.

35:13.067 --> 35:15.243
Francisco, shut this
travesty down.

35:15.330 --> 35:17.767
Uh, can't do that.
This is a CBI matter..

35:17.854 --> 35:20.335
- Right, Lisbon?
- Yes. I am afraid so.

35:20.422 --> 35:22.772
Ian, either Lily reads out aloud

35:22.859 --> 35:24.905
the reason you killed your
father for everyone to hear

35:24.992 --> 35:29.562
or you come with us...
right now, and confess.

35:29.649 --> 35:31.738
- The Choice is yours.
- What's happening?

35:31.825 --> 35:33.914
I don't know.
And-and I don't know

35:34.001 --> 35:37.004
what youthinkhappened,
but whatever's on that paper,

35:37.091 --> 35:38.136
it-it's not true.

35:38.223 --> 35:39.572
I think you do know.

35:39.659 --> 35:42.270
And the clock is ticking.

35:42.357 --> 35:45.055
Are you ready, Lily?

35:45.143 --> 35:46.622
Ian, when Lily reads
what's inside

35:46.709 --> 35:48.581
I can't control
what happens next.

35:50.235 --> 35:51.497
- Okay, I'll read it myself.
- No.

35:51.584 --> 35:56.154
No. Not-not now.
Not...not here.

35:56.241 --> 35:58.895
I'm sorry, folks.
I'll come with you, alright?

35:58.982 --> 35:59.896
Please, look,
whatever you want.

35:59.983 --> 36:01.246
Wise Choice.

36:01.333 --> 36:03.639
Ian Percy, you're under
arrest for murder.

36:03.726 --> 36:06.251
- Ian? Ian?
- It's-it's okay, mom.

36:06.338 --> 36:07.382
It's gonna be okay.

36:10.342 --> 36:11.734
[indistinct conversations]

36:24.573 --> 36:26.575
[Patrick]
'You were dating Lily, right?'

36:26.662 --> 36:28.795
On the downlow?

36:33.234 --> 36:36.237
I thought dad wouldn't approve.

36:36.324 --> 36:40.067
He thought the Percy name
was something special.

36:40.154 --> 36:42.243
'And she wasn't like us.'

36:42.330 --> 36:44.680
- How'd you know?
- That you two are in love?

36:44.767 --> 36:46.247
Oh, that was easy.

36:46.334 --> 36:48.031
Then there were
little things

36:48.118 --> 36:50.599
little things that said
that there was something, uh..

36:52.645 --> 36:53.907
...off.

36:56.649 --> 37:00.348
You know, everybody thought
my dad was some good guy.

37:00.435 --> 37:02.568
'And that he kept the town
going, you know?'

37:02.655 --> 37:05.048
But they didn't know..

37:05.135 --> 37:08.400
...how he terrorized us, that..

37:08.487 --> 37:10.358
...he wasn't fit.

37:11.620 --> 37:13.013
Not to raise a family.

37:14.971 --> 37:17.757
We need to know
how it happened.

37:17.844 --> 37:19.933
Start a month ago?

37:20.020 --> 37:23.197
Oh, it started before that.

37:23.284 --> 37:25.721
[sniffles]

37:25.808 --> 37:27.680
When I first moved back
from San Francisco

37:27.767 --> 37:29.159
it was like a few months ago.

37:31.771 --> 37:35.209
Meeting Lily was..

37:35.296 --> 37:36.776
It was like a dream.

37:38.299 --> 37:40.562
And I figured he-he
knew something

37:40.649 --> 37:42.912
when he started drinking again.

37:42.999 --> 37:45.959
He was too ashamed
to come to me, so..

37:46.046 --> 37:48.135
I went to him.

37:48.222 --> 37:49.832
And he was drunk.

37:52.357 --> 37:53.575
I didn't know
about his affair.

37:53.662 --> 37:55.273
I mean, how could I have
even guessed?

37:55.360 --> 37:58.188
I'm trying to tell you..

37:58.276 --> 38:00.408
...Lily is your sister.

38:00.495 --> 38:02.845
[chuckles]
No. No, that is absurd.

38:02.932 --> 38:04.934
- I know my own daughter.
- No. No, she can't.. No!

38:05.021 --> 38:06.545
We didn't think
you were coming back.

38:08.024 --> 38:10.157
- You abandoned us.
- Mom knows?

38:10.244 --> 38:12.507
No, of course not.

38:12.594 --> 38:16.468
Lily's mother and me
are kind of a..

38:16.555 --> 38:19.732
...a fling! You know,
we were young..

38:19.819 --> 38:21.168
...thirty years ago.

38:23.126 --> 38:26.391
- How could you do this to me?
- Do this to you?

38:27.696 --> 38:29.742
You spoiled brat.

38:29.829 --> 38:32.092
What the hell did I ever
do to you?

38:32.179 --> 38:33.615
I betrayed your mother,
not you.

38:33.702 --> 38:35.313
And that's my business.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.924
[chuckles]
Lily and you..

38:38.011 --> 38:41.536
...that's on you. You should
have been able to tell.

38:41.623 --> 38:43.059
So it's my fault, huh?

38:43.146 --> 38:47.499
It's not mine. Either way...
it doesn't matter.

38:47.586 --> 38:50.415
So, son, you gotta
suck it up and move on!

38:51.633 --> 38:53.069
Lily is not for you.

38:53.156 --> 38:55.028
She's the only girl
I have ever loved!

38:55.115 --> 38:56.899
I want to marry her!

38:56.986 --> 38:58.640
Boo-hoo-hoo.

38:58.727 --> 39:01.513
For the first time
in your life, son

39:01.600 --> 39:04.559
'face the facts that
are staring you in the face'

39:04.646 --> 39:05.604
'and stop whining!'

39:05.691 --> 39:07.736
[grunts]

39:07.823 --> 39:09.738
[grunts]

39:12.611 --> 39:14.482
[grunts]

39:16.571 --> 39:18.443
What do I even say to her?

39:20.836 --> 39:24.536
"Dad had an affair."
um, "I'm your brother."

39:24.623 --> 39:26.929
It's not gonna be easy.

39:28.714 --> 39:31.107
But you are gonna have to tell
her the truth at some point.

39:34.676 --> 39:36.461
I finally got through
to him, you know?

39:38.985 --> 39:42.467
It felt good...
for a second.

39:42.554 --> 39:45.818
That the old bastard
finally understood.

39:48.516 --> 39:51.345
When he was dying,
he...finally understood

39:51.432 --> 39:53.260
what he had done
to all of us.

39:57.482 --> 39:59.048
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:59.135 --> 40:01.486
You fooled a guy with
a mobile made-up arson lab?

40:01.573 --> 40:02.704
Neat trick.

40:02.791 --> 40:05.185
He didn't seem
to think so, but thanks.

40:05.272 --> 40:08.406
- So...good week then?
- Yeah. Yeah.

40:08.493 --> 40:12.192
Great, yeah.
Just moving with the wind.

40:15.369 --> 40:17.197
No, I'm sorry.
That was a lie.

40:17.284 --> 40:20.330
Uh, today is not a good day.

40:20.418 --> 40:21.462
We have to talk.

40:21.549 --> 40:23.072
Okay. About what?

40:23.159 --> 40:24.639
About you and me.

40:24.726 --> 40:26.511
Great. Because
there's something I really

40:26.598 --> 40:28.338
