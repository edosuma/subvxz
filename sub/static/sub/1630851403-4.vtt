00:11.520 --> 00:12.760
MAY 2018

00:17.880 --> 00:18.720
Yes?

00:18.800 --> 00:21.440
-If you're not ready I'll kill you.
-Yes, yes, we're coming.

00:24.600 --> 00:26.960
PINO MANIACI'S LEGAL TEAM IS REVIEWING

00:27.040 --> 00:30.160
THE CARABINIERI RECORDINGS
OF SOME MEETINGS

00:30.240 --> 00:33.400
BETWEEN MAYOR DE LUCA
AND HIS PRESS OFFICER PANETTINO

00:35.160 --> 00:37.480
-Pino, have a look at this, look.
-Yes.

00:38.160 --> 00:39.600
Note from the prosecutor,

00:40.440 --> 00:43.920
"On September 13th, 2014, at ten o'clock,

00:45.840 --> 00:49.520
Gioacchino De Luca and Giuseppe Panettino
come into the office."

00:50.560 --> 00:51.800
Look at what comes next.

00:52.960 --> 00:56.000
"Gioacchino De Luca
moves some papers on his desk."

00:57.080 --> 00:59.800
"He removes a page
from his spiral notebook."

01:02.560 --> 01:04.120
This is the whole sequence.

01:05.080 --> 01:07.640
"After removing the page
from the notebook,

01:07.720 --> 01:11.200
he tears a piece off
and then puts another sheet on the desk."

01:13.360 --> 01:15.360
"De Luca turns to Panettino,

01:16.400 --> 01:19.160
he picks up a pen
and starts writing on a sheet of paper

01:19.240 --> 01:22.200
while Panettino watches
from the other side of the desk."

01:25.640 --> 01:28.120
"Panettino takes the pen from De Luca

01:28.200 --> 01:31.080
and writes on the sheet,
and writes something in reply."

01:32.440 --> 01:36.760
"He points at the writing on the sheet.
He speaks into his ear again."

01:37.280 --> 01:38.120
Fine, let's see.

01:38.200 --> 01:40.520
"Panettino points to
the sheet of paper again."

01:40.600 --> 01:43.680
It's basically a conversation.
The report actually says it,

01:43.760 --> 01:47.040
it says they were having
a conversation via the sheet of paper.

01:48.240 --> 01:52.040
They were alone in that fucking room!
So they knew they were being recorded.

01:52.120 --> 01:53.920
Yeah.

01:55.760 --> 01:57.480
When he gets the money,

01:57.560 --> 02:00.680
De Luca speaks loudly,
looking at the cameras.

02:00.760 --> 02:01.920
What a coincidence.

02:04.200 --> 02:08.960
It's like we're in a scene
in a movie. It's all very theatrical,

02:09.680 --> 02:11.880
as if the mayor knew

02:11.960 --> 02:16.080
the camera was there,
and he had to build the key evidence.

02:17.960 --> 02:19.440
The aim of this video

02:19.520 --> 02:22.240
was to discredit Pino Maniaci.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.040
A NETFLIX DOCUMENTARY SERIES

02:52.120 --> 02:53.960
JUSTICE

02:54.040 --> 02:55.920
MAY 2018

02:56.520 --> 02:58.560
MANIACI TRIAL
EXTORTION CHARGE

02:58.640 --> 03:01.160
WITNESS: PANETTINO

03:10.360 --> 03:11.600
Panettino!

03:13.120 --> 03:14.640
Next witness, Panettino.

03:16.320 --> 03:18.080
Please have a seat, Mr. Panettino.

03:18.560 --> 03:20.000
You need to take the oath.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.760
"I swear to tell
the whole truth and not to hide anything

03:27.840 --> 03:29.080
that I am aware of."

03:29.720 --> 03:31.240
Right, go ahead, Madam.

03:31.320 --> 03:32.160
Great.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.040
So, Mr. Panettino, what was your role
within Borgetto Council?

03:38.120 --> 03:39.080
PUBLIC PROSECUTOR

03:40.640 --> 03:42.080
I was press officer.

03:42.160 --> 03:44.640
Let's say I took care
of relations with the press.

03:45.600 --> 03:49.000
What type of relationship did you have
in relation to publishing news

03:49.080 --> 03:51.160
related to Mayor Gioacchino De Luca?

03:52.280 --> 03:54.160
Maniaci had a new problem every day.

03:55.120 --> 03:59.520
He wanted money to avoid potential…
broadcasting potential reports,

03:59.600 --> 04:03.080
but he'd do the reports anyway,
and then he'd come back again.

04:03.160 --> 04:06.360
He contacted me in every way possible.
He wouldn't leave me alone.

04:09.920 --> 04:11.000
TELEPHONE RECORDING

04:11.080 --> 04:13.640
BETWEEN PANETTINO
AND THE THEN MAYOR DE LUCA

04:14.680 --> 04:16.640
He called me 12,000 times.

04:16.720 --> 04:20.320
Ah, it's fine.
Tell him we'll have it sorted tonight.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.480
Do it now, this guy is crazy.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.880
Did he do a report today?

04:27.960 --> 04:29.480
What? He did one.

04:30.320 --> 04:33.680
Make him wait. We'll give it
to him tomorrow. Don't worry. Okay?

04:33.760 --> 04:36.080
-Okay. Great. Bye.
-Okay, bye.

04:37.760 --> 04:39.000
I said to the mayor,

04:39.080 --> 04:43.440
"You can't carry on with this…
this… this continuous blackmail."

04:43.520 --> 04:44.920
"Call the Carabinieri."

04:46.160 --> 04:49.480
"Call someone, but you have to. You…"
It was impossible.

04:49.560 --> 04:51.040
He couldn't sleep at night.

04:52.520 --> 04:55.680
The Mafia kill with guns,
and he kills with the television.

04:59.760 --> 05:01.560
Listen, Mr. Panettino…

05:01.640 --> 05:02.720
PINO MANIACI'S LAWYER

05:02.800 --> 05:07.520
…how long have you known De Luca,
the former Mayor Gioacchino De Luca?

05:08.640 --> 05:09.880
I'm an only child.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.240
And--

05:11.320 --> 05:12.160
Okay.

05:12.240 --> 05:14.080
You asked
about our relationship.

05:14.160 --> 05:15.560
Start from your childhood.

05:15.640 --> 05:18.520
-Then this will go on until tomorrow.
-I have to say he's my friend.

05:18.600 --> 05:21.520
I don't just have to say
what you want to know.

05:21.600 --> 05:24.960
You can't make spontaneous statements.
You have to answer the questions.

05:25.040 --> 05:29.000
-You're not on trial yet. Go ahead.
-Is it normal to say something like that?

05:29.080 --> 05:32.240
You haven't been charged
in this trial, but let's see.

05:32.320 --> 05:35.240
If you give false statements,
you'll be accused of perjury.

05:35.840 --> 05:39.200
Your Honor, "But you haven't been
charged yet," it's inappropriate.

05:39.280 --> 05:42.880
He hasn't been accused yet,
in the sense that up until now,

05:42.960 --> 05:44.160
he hasn't been accused.

05:44.240 --> 05:47.400
Is it appropriate to say that
if a witness doesn't respond properly?

05:47.480 --> 05:49.920
-That he hasn't been charged yet?
-Prosecutor, don't include it.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Hey, I think not.

05:51.080 --> 05:55.520
Let's move on. No interruptions.
I never interrupted. Let's move on.

05:56.400 --> 05:57.600
You and the

05:58.360 --> 06:00.240
former Mayor De Luca,

06:01.440 --> 06:06.640
where were the places
where you'd generally meet and talk?

06:11.440 --> 06:15.720
I'd meet Mayor De Luca at the Town Hall,
at my house, at his house, everywhere.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.760
-We didn't have problems.
-Where in the Town Hall?

06:18.840 --> 06:20.960
-In the mayor's office?
-Yes, yes, yes.

06:23.720 --> 06:27.360
Would you usually speak to each other,
let's say, normally,

06:27.880 --> 06:30.840
at a normal volume or whispering?

06:38.160 --> 06:40.520
Sir, the only words
I whispered to the mayor,

06:40.600 --> 06:43.800
were because he came in.
He was with people in there.

06:45.120 --> 06:49.200
So if there wasn't anyone there,
you wouldn't have done it.

06:51.320 --> 06:52.880
Absolutely not. Why would I?

06:56.840 --> 06:59.080
Were there any circumstances

07:00.280 --> 07:04.280
where instead of talking to one another,

07:05.360 --> 07:07.400
each on different sides of the desk,

07:07.920 --> 07:10.120
without opening your mouths,

07:10.880 --> 07:15.360
you wrote on a piece of paper
and passed it between you,

07:15.880 --> 07:18.960
one of you would write, then pass the pen?

07:26.520 --> 07:27.880
Do you remember doing that?

07:27.960 --> 07:30.000
Your Honor,
I don't usually ever write.

07:30.520 --> 07:32.200
-What?
-I never write like that.

07:32.280 --> 07:34.080
Because I have terrible handwriting.

07:39.520 --> 07:40.920
Did you ever know or suspect

07:41.000 --> 07:43.640
that the room was bugged
or had hidden cameras?

07:46.760 --> 07:47.760
Absolutely not.

07:48.600 --> 07:49.480
No, no.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.080
Okay. No more questions, Your Honor.

07:59.600 --> 08:00.760
Fine. We've finished.

08:01.720 --> 08:02.760
Thanks.

08:05.480 --> 08:06.320
It went well.

08:15.560 --> 08:19.240
The further we go, the more
the prosecution's castle crumbles.

08:20.040 --> 08:21.240
It's becoming clear

08:21.320 --> 08:24.160
that the prosecution's case
is based on thin air.

08:27.880 --> 08:30.160
"Thin air,"
that's beautiful.

08:35.200 --> 08:36.120
Music!

08:46.320 --> 08:49.560
There are many people
who want to shut Pino Maniaci up,

08:49.640 --> 08:51.640
Mafia and non-Mafia.

08:52.800 --> 08:57.600
Because Pino Maniaci has bravely exposed
what is wrong with the State.

08:59.640 --> 09:00.600
I know what happens

09:00.680 --> 09:03.800
when you go against the system
because it also happened to me.

09:04.680 --> 09:07.160
There was also a vendetta against me

09:07.680 --> 09:13.160
when, as well as dealing with the Mafia,
I started looking into State corruption.

09:15.840 --> 09:17.520
The investigation that I started,

09:17.600 --> 09:21.240
and the trial about negotiations
between the State and the Mafia.

09:21.760 --> 09:25.240
My investigation discovered and showed

09:26.840 --> 09:30.160
that while the Mafia
was killing statesmen,

09:31.200 --> 09:35.160
like Falcone, Borsellino
and other innocent citizens,

09:35.840 --> 09:39.400
there were other statesmen
who were making deals with the Mafia.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.120
There are only a few judges
who have fought

09:49.200 --> 09:51.640
the State's complicity with the Mafia.

09:55.280 --> 09:57.600
I was never forgiven for this.

10:03.520 --> 10:09.840
The Mafia uses violence
and intimidation as their primary tool.

10:11.440 --> 10:15.360
Statespeople have different,
more subtle tools,

10:16.600 --> 10:19.280
like denigration and defamation.

10:20.640 --> 10:24.640
Sometimes the State sullies people
before taking them to trial.

10:26.360 --> 10:27.760
MARCH 2017

10:27.840 --> 10:30.240
Antonio Ingroia,
former Palermo prosecutor,

10:30.320 --> 10:31.880
has been accused of embezzlement.

10:31.960 --> 10:34.840
According to the prosecution,
between 2014 and 2016,

10:34.920 --> 10:37.880
the former anti-Mafia prosecutor,
allegedly, received

10:37.960 --> 10:41.520
expense reimbursements
for business trips worth €30,000.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.720
There's also an allegation against him

10:43.800 --> 10:47.000
about a performance bonus of €117,000.

10:48.360 --> 10:49.440
"I'm very upset."

10:49.520 --> 10:51.160
"I've always respected the law."

10:57.640 --> 10:59.240
In 2013,

11:00.720 --> 11:03.040
shortly after I left the judiciary…

11:05.160 --> 11:08.240
I took a job
as the commissioner of a company.

11:10.040 --> 11:12.680
The company was at risk of bankruptcy.

11:13.800 --> 11:14.640
I intervened.

11:14.720 --> 11:18.520
I took up my responsibilities,
I managed to save the company.

11:19.280 --> 11:21.720
And all of a sudden,
the prosecution office

11:21.800 --> 11:24.600
decided to accuse me instead.

11:25.600 --> 11:30.320
This embezzlement, where it basically says
that I paid myself a bonus,

11:32.880 --> 11:37.880
and that I stole from the… the…
As if I were a common thief,

11:37.960 --> 11:41.440
as if I stole from the company accounts,
which isn't true.

11:42.120 --> 11:44.480
That bonus was rightfully mine.

11:50.120 --> 11:51.120
Ingroia

11:52.560 --> 11:55.880
is one of the strangest people
in the judiciary.

11:57.160 --> 12:00.000
He should be thinking about
his own legal problems.

12:00.920 --> 12:03.800
It disgusts me
that Ingroia is supporting Maniaci.

12:05.960 --> 12:10.440
These people are being investigated
for very serious crimes.

12:11.080 --> 12:13.480
I know a few things about Maniaci

12:13.560 --> 12:15.440
that are very significant.

12:15.520 --> 12:17.960
Because they are things
that I found in documents

12:18.040 --> 12:20.960
from the trials of various mafiosos
that I compiled

12:21.040 --> 12:23.320
when I was doing preventive measures.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.560
SILVANA SAGUTO STARTS HER DEFENSE STRATEGY

12:25.640 --> 12:28.000
BY ATTACKING PINO MANIACI'S REPUTATION

12:28.080 --> 12:29.680
AS AN ANTI-MAFIA JOURNALIST

12:32.080 --> 12:35.200
I know about relationships
that he had with some Mafia members,

12:35.280 --> 12:38.800
that don't match up
with his reputation as an anti-Mafia hero.

12:38.880 --> 12:40.720
They can choose not to believe them.

12:40.800 --> 12:43.880
They can say they aren't true,
but there are documents.

12:43.960 --> 12:46.200
I don't learn things
because someone told me,

12:46.720 --> 12:49.880
I learn because I have found
inexplicable payments

12:49.960 --> 12:53.560
to Telejato from people
I have investigated.

12:58.480 --> 13:01.280
Pino Maniaci is the person
who gives a voice

13:01.960 --> 13:06.920
to those who want
to abolish preventive measures.

13:10.400 --> 13:14.720
The first person that Maniaci
started defending was Impastato.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.480
JANUARY 2013

13:17.360 --> 13:18.880
We are talking about the…

13:20.560 --> 13:23.280
the quarry seized
from the Impastato family…

13:25.640 --> 13:27.680
which is waiting to be confiscated

13:27.760 --> 13:30.040
or to be released from seizure.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.840
Andrea Impastato
is a Mafia member.

13:36.880 --> 13:39.720
€150 million were seized from him,

13:39.800 --> 13:43.680
and he was definitively convicted
for Mafia association.

13:46.200 --> 13:49.200
And Maniaci gave him
all the space he wanted.

13:54.560 --> 13:57.880
We then, by chance, found out

13:57.960 --> 14:02.880
that Impastato's children
gave Maniaci a car.

14:05.840 --> 14:09.920
And afterwards, he continued with
any other mafiosos in the area

14:10.000 --> 14:11.920
his television station covers.

14:18.760 --> 14:22.520
We also found out that Maniaci
was only continuing to air

14:22.600 --> 14:25.240
because he was broadcasting on frequencies

14:26.120 --> 14:27.960
owned by other individuals

14:28.040 --> 14:31.480
whose grandfather had been convicted
for Mafia association.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.600
We came to the conclusion
that Pino Maniaci gained financially

14:39.680 --> 14:43.280
from his proximity to the Mafia,
from Mafia families

14:43.360 --> 14:45.200
that he was defending on TV.

14:50.960 --> 14:53.440
I can't wait
to be able to say what I think…

14:56.200 --> 15:01.360
and say it in a court of law
because I'm sure of what I wanna say,

15:01.440 --> 15:03.200
and that I can prove it.

15:05.880 --> 15:09.160
Because I'm only talking about the facts,
not hearsay.

15:20.880 --> 15:21.920
Pizza!

15:27.040 --> 15:28.240
See it?

15:29.200 --> 15:31.160
Is someone calling you, ma'am?

15:31.240 --> 15:33.520
Ma'am, tell me, do you want some cheese?

15:34.200 --> 15:35.080
Sit down!

15:39.440 --> 15:40.800
I didn't do shit.

15:43.320 --> 15:44.840
I have been crucified…

15:47.760 --> 15:49.280
for my investigations.

15:50.240 --> 15:54.440
Come on. I'll do the--
A lighter? Shall we light them all?

15:57.480 --> 16:02.240
We found out
and we knowingly have touched

16:02.320 --> 16:03.960
high-voltage wires,

16:05.360 --> 16:09.240
which might have burned
or even electrocuted us.

16:16.920 --> 16:18.720
Extortion is a do ut des.

16:19.440 --> 16:22.480
I give you something
if you give me something.

16:25.200 --> 16:30.800
Since they couldn't find any real crimes,
they used Mayor Lo Biundo.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.560
THE NEXT PROSECUTION WITNESS

16:35.640 --> 16:38.720
IS THE FORMER MAYOR OF PARTINICO,
SALVATORE LO BIUNDO

16:40.920 --> 16:45.160
Two people that Pino Maniaci
allegedly extorted are two mayors,

16:45.240 --> 16:47.640
De Luca, the former mayor of Borgetto,

16:47.720 --> 16:50.240
and Lo Biundo, the mayor of Partinico.

16:50.320 --> 16:51.880
This is legality!

16:51.960 --> 16:53.040
SEPTEMBER 2015

16:53.120 --> 16:54.720
Mr. Mayor,

16:54.800 --> 16:55.800
something stinks.

16:56.760 --> 16:58.120
It stinks.

17:00.360 --> 17:02.560
Don't look for the mayor of Partinico.

17:02.640 --> 17:03.720
You won't find him.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.920
He completely left the city to itself

17:09.440 --> 17:12.360
because he's flying high, very high,

17:12.880 --> 17:15.360
in Brussels, in Turin,

17:16.560 --> 17:18.640
to get away from the stink of Partinico.

17:22.600 --> 17:24.560
What the prosecution wants to show,

17:24.640 --> 17:27.920
from its point of view,
is that there's a Maniaci system,

17:28.000 --> 17:29.920
which is a system through which

17:30.440 --> 17:34.120
various public figures,
particularly local politicians…

17:34.200 --> 17:35.280
PINO MANIACI'S LAWYER

17:35.360 --> 17:37.880
…are publicly attacked
by Maniaci or Telejato,

17:37.960 --> 17:41.760
if they don't pay,
and war is waged against them.

17:43.720 --> 17:48.320
When Lo Biundo was called as a witness,
of course, we were anxious.

17:51.160 --> 17:55.240
Out of respect for the citizens
who voted for him, he should do one thing.

17:57.480 --> 17:58.520
Resign.

18:04.080 --> 18:08.960
NOVEMBER 2018

18:15.720 --> 18:17.280
No, Lo Biundo has to admit

18:17.360 --> 18:20.000
that he was never extorted
by Pino Maniaci, for a start.

18:20.080 --> 18:21.200
Let's see what he said

18:21.280 --> 18:23.960
because you're dreaming about
what he'll say in court.

18:24.040 --> 18:25.440
Let's see what it says here.

18:25.520 --> 18:28.520
Perfect. I'll dream it,
and then we'll put it to the test.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.920
-We'll put my dream to the test.
-Yeah, let's see.

18:37.400 --> 18:39.800
"I handed money over out of fear."

18:40.320 --> 18:41.440
This is the extortion.

18:41.960 --> 18:44.320
"If I refused, Maniaci would broadcast

18:44.400 --> 18:47.080
extremely damaging reports
for me and my council--"

18:47.160 --> 18:48.000
Stop.

18:48.960 --> 18:50.120
We have a council--

18:50.200 --> 18:51.760
Yes, wait. Stop there.

18:52.480 --> 18:54.840
I'm just here to show his statements.

18:54.920 --> 18:56.840
Don't argue with me right now.

18:56.920 --> 18:59.680
No. Can't you see
that they make them write these things--

18:59.760 --> 19:01.640
Now we'll find out from Lo Biundo.

19:02.160 --> 19:03.320
Okay, perfect.

19:12.880 --> 19:15.480
MANIACI'S TRIAL
EXTORTION CHARGE

19:15.560 --> 19:16.960
WITNESS: LO BIUNDO

19:24.920 --> 19:26.800
Great. Over to you, Prosecutor.

19:27.920 --> 19:29.080
By virtue of this role,

19:29.160 --> 19:32.320
which you have just reported to us,
did you know Pino Maniaci?

19:33.720 --> 19:35.840
I've known him since I went into politics.

19:37.920 --> 19:40.320
We all supported Pino Maniaci's work.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.440
We were all Pino Maniaci at that time.

19:44.920 --> 19:49.280
And he represented
a symbol of legality for everyone.

19:50.680 --> 19:52.400
Was your relationship always good?

19:53.880 --> 19:56.600
Relations were never good
with Pino Maniaci.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.040
Why not?

19:58.800 --> 20:02.960
Relations…
Because he didn't leave politicians alone.

20:04.280 --> 20:06.440
He carried on directly attacking us

20:08.400 --> 20:12.120
because he thought
he was the bearer of truth and justice.

20:13.400 --> 20:19.600
THE ALLEGED EXTORTION REVOLVES AROUND
A WOMAN BEING HIRED IN PARTINICO'S COUNCIL

20:22.320 --> 20:25.040
This lady is a cleaner
at Partinico Council.

20:29.160 --> 20:31.040
She needed some financial support

20:31.640 --> 20:34.000
to be able to take her daughter to Palermo

20:35.400 --> 20:37.640
and to be able
to carry on looking after her,

20:37.720 --> 20:39.560
so she could get treatment.

20:43.240 --> 20:46.760
Obviously, my request
to Lo Biundo at that time

20:46.840 --> 20:49.760
was strictly related to that lady's needs.

20:55.520 --> 20:57.840
Tells us a bit about this woman.

20:58.720 --> 21:01.720
If you met her, why and how you know her.

21:04.560 --> 21:07.280
So, the first time
that I met this lady was

21:08.800 --> 21:11.480
because she came
to my office to do the cleaning.

21:12.840 --> 21:15.600
So do you remember
that her contract was about to expire?

21:15.680 --> 21:16.520
Yes. Yes.

21:17.720 --> 21:19.920
When it expires, what happens?

21:22.200 --> 21:25.680
Pino Maniaci showed up
to support this lady's case.

21:28.640 --> 21:29.800
And I explicitly said

21:29.880 --> 21:33.120
that everything would be done
according to the rankings

21:33.200 --> 21:37.760
and so I couldn't continue the contract
and allow her to carry on working.

21:40.000 --> 21:44.120
Pino's problem is that he's trying
to help someone he cares about.

21:44.200 --> 21:45.040
NOVEMBER 2014

21:45.120 --> 21:48.200
PHONE RECORDINGS
BETWEEN PINO MANIACI AND THE CLEANER

21:50.760 --> 21:52.120
I'll look after you.

21:52.640 --> 21:55.320
When you have your 1,500-2,000 euros,

21:55.400 --> 21:57.640
it'll be fine. I can die happy.

21:58.120 --> 21:59.160
Okay.

22:01.040 --> 22:02.760
I want a good life for you…

22:03.880 --> 22:05.080
a good home.

22:05.760 --> 22:08.400
Shit, shit,
you always make me cry.

22:09.560 --> 22:11.960
Talk to you later, darling.

22:16.200 --> 22:17.200
The lover,

22:17.280 --> 22:20.800
since she had a child
with a very serious disability,

22:20.880 --> 22:24.280
he wanted to help her find a job,
so he used everyone he knew.

22:24.360 --> 22:27.600
He said "You have to let her work.
She deserves it."

22:28.360 --> 22:31.040
But he wasn't subtle about it.

22:31.120 --> 22:33.080
He doesn't care about things like that.

22:35.920 --> 22:39.200
How did Pino Maniaci ask
about hiring this lady?

22:39.280 --> 22:42.680
How did he do it,
and what was at stake if you refused?

22:47.640 --> 22:51.480
He kept pushing
in his usual aggressive and angry way…

22:54.080 --> 22:57.960
saying, "Ah, you have to
because she really needs it,"

22:58.480 --> 23:03.400
and all the rest, and so
I agreed to their... to his request.

23:07.880 --> 23:11.000
That doesn't match up with
what you've said in the past though.

23:11.840 --> 23:13.040
What do you mean?

23:13.720 --> 23:15.880
Because I don't remember
my whole statement,

23:16.480 --> 23:18.080
so I'd like to understand.

23:18.160 --> 23:20.080
-Shall I remind you?
-Yes.

23:20.160 --> 23:23.080
So, on this point,
"I agreed to give her money."

23:23.160 --> 23:25.280
-Did you pay her?
-Yes. Yes.

23:25.360 --> 23:26.360
From your pocket?

23:26.440 --> 23:27.640
From my pocket, yes.

23:29.760 --> 23:31.960
"I was scared that if I refused to pay,

23:32.040 --> 23:35.920
Maniaci would broadcast
damaging things about me and my council."

23:38.200 --> 23:42.920
It was a concern, but like I said,
it was a constant concern that he'd do it.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.480
Here is
where the whole charge crumbles.

23:50.640 --> 23:53.400
In that moment, when the mayor says,

23:54.080 --> 23:56.440
"You know Pino Maniaci, his ways,

23:56.960 --> 23:59.160
at this point to get him out of my way..."

23:59.960 --> 24:00.920
The crime is gone.

24:03.280 --> 24:05.560
Have you ever been threatened
by Pino Maniaci?

24:14.240 --> 24:17.040
On TV,
in relation to my political activities.

24:17.120 --> 24:19.000
-Threatened how?
-Political, it the…

24:19.080 --> 24:20.800
-Not threats.
-No, threats.

24:20.880 --> 24:23.640
Threats meaning,
"If you don't do this, I'll do this."

24:24.440 --> 24:26.400
Absolutely. Never. No.

24:26.480 --> 24:28.840
I thought you were talking about… Sorry.

24:28.920 --> 24:31.360
-Verbal attacks.
-Verbal attacks.

24:31.440 --> 24:32.760
It's different from a threat.

24:38.240 --> 24:40.320
Okay. No more questions, thank you.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.480
I think the hearing went very well.

24:46.160 --> 24:49.480
The former Mayor Lo Biundo
was one of the main witnesses,

24:49.560 --> 24:52.600
and today he said he'd never
been threatened by Pino Maniaci…

24:55.360 --> 24:58.440
and that he hadn't committed a crime
or an unlawful act

24:58.520 --> 25:00.680
by helping a lady who needed help

25:01.200 --> 25:03.160
because she was in social hardship.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.680
Even though the hearing went well,
you can't expect me

25:09.760 --> 25:11.280
to go home and celebrate,

25:11.360 --> 25:13.560
or that I'll arrive home
to hugs and kisses.

25:16.440 --> 25:18.960
Today's hearing was sensitive.

25:22.960 --> 25:25.880
It plunges a knife
into a wound for my family

25:25.960 --> 25:28.880
because they keep talking
about Pino Maniaci's lover.

25:31.400 --> 25:32.240
Right?

25:42.640 --> 25:43.480
OCTOBER 2014

25:43.560 --> 25:47.640
TELEPHONE RECORDINGS
BETWEEN PINO MANIACI AND HIS LOVER

25:49.640 --> 25:52.800
You don't know how powerful
Pino Maniaci is. Don't worry.

25:52.880 --> 25:54.960
I'll make sure you'll come out on top.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.520
I can get you a job anywhere.

25:58.280 --> 25:59.440
Did he say yes?

26:00.680 --> 26:02.160
Of course he said yes.

26:03.400 --> 26:06.520
You make everyone tremble in fear
with your TV station.

26:06.600 --> 26:10.160
I already called the mayor.
I told him the figures didn't add up.

26:11.640 --> 26:14.280
He said, "Oh, really?"
"Yes, like I told you."

26:14.360 --> 26:17.200
He said, "So, what do we need to do,
a double wage?"

26:17.280 --> 26:19.600
"No, no," I said,
"Not fucking double, triple."

26:21.080 --> 26:23.880
You'll get €1,800 a month.
I don't even get that.

26:24.400 --> 26:26.400
Except I'd have to
blow it up for you.

26:26.920 --> 26:28.960
You only get
to blow one thing of mine.

26:29.040 --> 26:30.040
Your dick.

26:34.120 --> 26:39.000
PINO MANIACI'S BIRTHPLACE

26:39.080 --> 26:40.000
MANIACI
BAKERY

26:40.520 --> 26:43.400
I could write an encyclopedia
about my brother Pino.

26:47.400 --> 26:49.320
Apart from some lies,

26:49.400 --> 26:50.720
which we forget about,

26:51.720 --> 26:54.080
it's part of what makes his personality.

26:55.320 --> 26:58.080
He's had plenty of misfortune.

27:11.800 --> 27:14.840
Pino got married in September 1980.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.360
Barely a year later, he had a daughter.

27:21.080 --> 27:23.760
He wasn't there for her first birthday…

27:26.560 --> 27:29.480
because he had run off with another woman.

27:32.520 --> 27:33.920
A certain Patrizia.

27:36.760 --> 27:39.520
Then recently,
he started seeing someone else,

27:39.600 --> 27:42.520
so he had problems with Patrizia.
He made a mess.

27:44.200 --> 27:45.640
So where's that coffee?

27:48.720 --> 27:52.720
I told him not just once, but hundreds
and thousands of times because

27:53.880 --> 27:55.640
everyone likes sex…

27:58.760 --> 28:01.680
but there are rules to follow, right?

28:09.440 --> 28:10.600
For the whole family,

28:10.680 --> 28:14.400
the trial is something that…
Because there are

28:15.880 --> 28:17.360
things that aren't right.

28:18.600 --> 28:20.200
You know why they aren't right?

28:22.720 --> 28:25.680
Because they are
basically accusing Pino because

28:26.720 --> 28:28.480
a girl asked him for a job

28:30.280 --> 28:32.120
and so she was his lover.

28:33.520 --> 28:35.000
Pino, a lover?

28:49.520 --> 28:51.960
-Where's Letizia?
-In the bathroom.

29:01.920 --> 29:03.000
I'm strong,

29:04.040 --> 29:06.120
but there are moments when perhaps

29:07.680 --> 29:10.640
something they said,
it comes into your head, you know?

29:12.440 --> 29:13.960
I'm not made of iron.

29:15.680 --> 29:17.160
I'm upset as well.

29:20.960 --> 29:24.640
Let's put it like this.
If someone makes a mistake...

29:26.320 --> 29:28.280
I say that I didn't make a mistake.

29:29.880 --> 29:31.040
If someone likes

29:31.120 --> 29:32.080
to fuck,

29:32.960 --> 29:34.520
they can't be anti-Mafia?

29:55.560 --> 29:56.840
The former president

29:56.920 --> 30:00.840
of the Preventive Measures Department
of the Court of Palermo is on trial.

30:00.920 --> 30:02.200
Silvana Saguto announced

30:02.280 --> 30:05.720
that she will fight back
and prove her commitment to justice.

30:13.800 --> 30:15.800
It's not nice to be on trial…

30:17.920 --> 30:21.200
because being on trial
is already a kind of punishment.

30:23.440 --> 30:26.280
I don't see any weak points
in our defense.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.880
If someone wants to make something up,
they can make something up.

30:32.520 --> 30:35.640
I think this will be
a particularly difficult period.

30:38.320 --> 30:41.920
It depends how they present
the various charges

30:43.480 --> 30:45.280
and how they support them.

30:45.360 --> 30:46.520
I'm being realistic.

30:46.600 --> 30:48.560
-I know you're being pessimistic.
-No.

30:48.640 --> 30:50.640
-That's a different thing.
-No, no, no, no, no.

30:50.720 --> 30:52.520
You've always been pessimistic.

30:53.760 --> 30:57.160
I realize
that this sentence will only end badly

30:57.240 --> 30:59.120
if there's a conspiracy against me.

31:11.640 --> 31:14.680
FEBRUARY 2019

31:15.280 --> 31:18.040
SAGUTO'S TRIAL IS IN CALTANISSETTA,
130 KM FROM PALERMO

31:18.120 --> 31:21.080
BECAUSE JUDGES
CAN'T BE TRIED IN THEIR OWN DISTRICT

31:25.960 --> 31:29.040
Today, I want to be able
to finally express my opinion

31:29.120 --> 31:31.560
by going to the Caltanissetta court

31:32.080 --> 31:34.680
and explaining everything I've done.

31:37.400 --> 31:41.440
I know I behaved well,
not only in line with what was my duty,

31:41.520 --> 31:43.640
but also I went beyond that,

31:44.960 --> 31:48.200
risking my life to be able
to make preventive measures

31:49.560 --> 31:52.280
effective enough to fight the Mafia.

31:55.360 --> 31:58.440
SAGUTO'S TRIAL

31:58.520 --> 32:02.960
CROSS-EXAMINATION OF SILVANA SAGUTO

32:04.760 --> 32:06.600
This is an extraordinary trial

32:07.440 --> 32:10.040
because of the complexity of the issues,

32:10.120 --> 32:13.200
the number of charges,
and the individuals involved.

32:13.800 --> 32:15.360
We're talking about judges.

32:15.440 --> 32:19.240
We're talking about lawyers,
we're talking about public functions

32:19.320 --> 32:20.800
that were carried out.

32:22.320 --> 32:24.600
The sentence will be part of the history

32:24.680 --> 32:27.280
of the administration of justice in Italy.

32:33.280 --> 32:38.160
When I walked into the courtroom,
I was ready to go. I wanted to speak.

32:41.640 --> 32:42.840
Judge Saguto…

32:44.960 --> 32:46.080
what did you do

32:46.160 --> 32:49.640
when Maniaci's first reports
with Telejato came out?

32:53.200 --> 32:54.800
We probably underestimated

32:54.880 --> 32:58.600
the power of the media
even from these uneducated people.

33:00.320 --> 33:01.840
We found out that Telejato

33:01.920 --> 33:05.600
was doing anti-Mafia work
but also taking money from the Mafia.

33:07.120 --> 33:10.600
A construction business owner
who owned a quarry who had…

33:12.120 --> 33:14.640
The administrator told me
that he had found

33:14.720 --> 33:17.920
several payments of €6,000 to Telejato.

33:20.120 --> 33:22.920
Impastato, which was another quarry
we had seized,

33:23.880 --> 33:24.920
they gave him cars.

33:26.400 --> 33:29.960
We started to understand
why Maniaci was so angry with us.

33:31.440 --> 33:33.920
I made the mistake
of not reporting him straight away,

33:34.000 --> 33:35.520
because he might have shut up,

33:35.600 --> 33:38.560
and perhaps none of this
would have happened, because strangely,

33:38.640 --> 33:41.480
they all went along
with the ravings of a lunatic.

33:47.080 --> 33:49.720
Madam,
I'd like to move onto your relations

33:49.800 --> 33:52.600
with the lawyer
Cappellano Seminara for a moment.

33:54.160 --> 33:56.160
PUBLIC PROSECUTOR

33:56.240 --> 33:58.640
You say that you are
completely independent

33:58.720 --> 34:00.160
from Cappellano Seminara,

34:00.680 --> 34:03.400
so there is absolutely
no economic interest

34:03.480 --> 34:06.200
in Cappellano Seminara's
financial affairs.

34:06.280 --> 34:07.240
Is that correct?

34:07.760 --> 34:08.600
Yes.

34:11.120 --> 34:12.240
Cappellano Seminara

34:12.320 --> 34:16.280
was the most in demand
from all the judges, all my colleagues.

34:16.360 --> 34:20.600
We said there was no one as good as him
because he was so organized.

34:21.520 --> 34:24.040
There was no point
in me recommending this or that,

34:24.120 --> 34:25.800
as long as they were good people.

34:27.480 --> 34:29.160
Do you know what the amounts paid

34:29.240 --> 34:32.920
to your husband Lorenzo Caramma
by Cappellano Seminara were?

34:34.200 --> 34:36.760
No, no, no.
You know what you have written down.

34:36.840 --> 34:39.320
I don't know.
I don't know. I have no idea.

34:39.400 --> 34:43.360
The financial police estimates
around one and a half million euros,

34:43.440 --> 34:44.920
and, how should I put this,

34:45.000 --> 34:49.400
the payments from Cappellano Seminara
were around €1,200,000.

34:49.480 --> 34:52.560
-I have no idea.
-So… I'm not that good at math.

34:52.640 --> 34:55.200
-But I'd say that 80%…
-I don't think it's…

34:55.280 --> 34:57.280
I don't know. I can't answer that.

35:00.040 --> 35:01.680
It might seem strange,

35:01.760 --> 35:05.200
but since these payments were made
a long time after the job was completed,

35:06.080 --> 35:07.480
I lost track over time.

35:10.280 --> 35:12.840
I asked Cappellano for the payments

35:12.920 --> 35:16.640
of sums already accrued
when we were in difficulty.

35:17.520 --> 35:18.920
What were the terms, please?

35:19.600 --> 35:22.120
Well, I wouldn't have pulled out
a gun to ask him.

35:28.000 --> 35:32.280
When President Saguto was managing
the Preventive Measures Department,

35:33.240 --> 35:36.440
there wasn't a system
or a "magic circle" of any kind,

35:38.240 --> 35:42.040
there was no favoring
of certain administrators over others.

35:44.720 --> 35:47.400
And with regard to Cappellano Seminara,

35:49.040 --> 35:51.840
the number and the type
of assignments that he got

35:51.920 --> 35:56.880
were comparable to those given
to other judicial administrators.

36:01.920 --> 36:05.360
I've brought this booklet
because, as Bonaccorso will remember,

36:05.440 --> 36:08.000
he came to my office
because he was a public prosecutor.

36:09.960 --> 36:11.320
All us judges had a box

36:11.400 --> 36:13.160
with all the business cards

36:13.240 --> 36:17.440
of different administrators
who were recommended or put forward.

36:22.720 --> 36:25.280
Almost every card says
who recommended them.

36:27.400 --> 36:28.440
Here they all are.

36:33.400 --> 36:34.360
They're all here.

36:38.200 --> 36:41.160
Saguto arrived in court
with this card holder

36:41.240 --> 36:43.360
and then read it, or pretended to read it.

36:46.240 --> 36:49.280
She showed it,
while reminding the prosecutor

36:49.360 --> 36:51.000
that he went to her office.

36:53.440 --> 36:54.960
It was a clear threat.

36:59.520 --> 37:02.440
Either you acquit me,
or I tell you the names

37:02.520 --> 37:05.160
of all the judges that came by my office.

37:08.080 --> 37:10.200
We say, "Samson dies

37:11.960 --> 37:13.600
along with all the Philistines."
