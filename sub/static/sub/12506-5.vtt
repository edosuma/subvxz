00:05.606 --> 00:07.041
[Kaylie] Previously
on Make It Or Break It:

00:07.075 --> 00:09.610
The girl I put you with
is your other half.

00:09.643 --> 00:11.579
Payson and Lauren
are not perfect.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.547
You and me, girl.
All the way.

00:13.581 --> 00:15.983
Coach McIntire knew
all the choreography
to our routines

00:16.016 --> 00:17.685
even though we
never showed him?

00:17.718 --> 00:19.153
Jordan's the narc.

00:20.088 --> 00:22.290
You're dead to us.

00:22.323 --> 00:25.726
I made an appointment for you
with the TC doctor.

00:25.759 --> 00:28.496
I talked to Dr. Curtis.
She told me you have
an irregular heartbeat.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.331
My life, my call.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.735
[McIntire] Take
a good look around, ladies.

00:36.437 --> 00:40.141
This is the last week all of you
will be standing here together.

00:41.409 --> 00:43.744
May I introduce
Miss Regina Turner,

00:43.777 --> 00:45.746
the new head
of the NGO Olympic Committee

00:45.779 --> 00:48.616
and former all-around champion.

00:48.649 --> 00:51.619
She is here to help judge
the elimination rounds.

00:51.652 --> 00:54.255
- Hello, ladies.
- The numbers inside this cap

00:54.288 --> 00:56.824
will determine which day
your team performs
for the committee.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.428
One team member
will pick for your team.

01:02.563 --> 01:06.634
Ms. Turner, can you tell
these young ladies
what to expect?

01:06.667 --> 01:09.637
More like what not to expect.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.806
We could ask you to perform
on only one apparatus
or all four.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.708
Be ready for anything.

01:14.742 --> 01:17.278
Think of it
as a gymnastics pop quiz.

01:17.311 --> 01:20.814
When these two days
are complete, Coach McIntire
and the NGO will determine

01:20.848 --> 01:23.351
if you have what it takes
to remain here

01:23.384 --> 01:25.553
and continue to fight
for a spot on the Olympic team.

01:25.586 --> 01:30.358
But in this round
if you fail to impress,

01:30.391 --> 01:31.792
you will be sent home.

01:34.828 --> 01:35.729
Any questions?

01:37.398 --> 01:39.567
Well then,
what are you waiting for?

01:40.768 --> 01:42.636
- Oh, we're day two!
- Thank God.

01:42.670 --> 01:45.406
- Us, too.
- We're day one!

01:46.674 --> 01:48.309
You say that
like it's a good thing.

01:48.342 --> 01:49.810
One's my lucky number.

01:49.843 --> 01:51.312
[Kelly] Yeah, well,
not this time.

01:51.345 --> 01:53.214
Competing on day two means
you have more time to prepare.

01:53.247 --> 01:55.549
Plus, the judges
make their decisions
at the end of day two.

01:55.583 --> 01:58.085
They've just seen you perform,
so you're fresh in their minds.

01:58.118 --> 02:01.755
Look, day one girls
are like the appetizers
nobody wants to fill up on,

02:01.789 --> 02:04.158
which makes you two
pigs in a blanket

02:04.192 --> 02:06.460
and us filet mignon.

02:06.494 --> 02:09.630
Well, that just means
we'll be kicking your ass
one day earlier, so...

02:09.663 --> 02:13.267
All right, all right. Until we
complete the elimination round,

02:13.301 --> 02:15.769
we are imposing a strict curfew.

02:15.803 --> 02:18.472
No one in or out
after seven p.m.

02:18.506 --> 02:21.442
- Why?
- Because I want your head
in the game.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.844
That work for you, Keeler?

02:23.877 --> 02:26.880
I suggest you all make
the most of practice time.

02:28.249 --> 02:29.883
Your future depends on it.

02:35.923 --> 02:38.492
[Payson] Keep breathing.
Let your shoulders drop.

02:38.526 --> 02:40.494
Feel the weight
holding them down.

02:40.528 --> 02:43.864
[sighs] You mean
like someone's on my back?

02:43.897 --> 02:46.234
I am so feeling it.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.769
You need to start
taking this seriously.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.306
You're the one
who needs to chill.

02:52.340 --> 02:54.542
You've been watching me
like a hawk all week.

02:54.575 --> 02:57.511
I'm just trying to help. Stress
could cause another episode.

02:57.545 --> 03:00.681
Dr. Curtis said I've
probably had this arrhythmia
my entire life,

03:00.714 --> 03:02.516
and I've never had
any problems before.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.518
But you do now!

03:04.552 --> 03:07.455
Only a cardiologist
will be able to tell you
what's going on with you.

03:07.488 --> 03:10.758
Which is why I have
an appointment with the one
Dr. Curtis recommended

03:10.791 --> 03:14.161
right after NGO cuts.
So, let's dial back
the attitude.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.763
All right, all right.
I'm just uptight.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.498
Even more than usual.

03:17.531 --> 03:18.799
Rigo's finally back
from his meet,

03:18.832 --> 03:21.168
and we were supposed
to see each other tonight.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.836
So? See him after cuts, Pay.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.306
Really? Now, that's so not
how I thought you would react.

03:25.339 --> 03:28.242
- What'd you think I'd say?
- That I don't need
the extra rest tonight

03:28.276 --> 03:31.312
because we're not up
till day two, which means
tomorrow is just a practice day,

03:31.345 --> 03:32.846
that I completely should
go hang out with Rigo,

03:32.880 --> 03:35.816
and so I can get my fix
of his big, beautiful,
brown eyes,

03:35.849 --> 03:37.451
and then get my head
back in the game.

03:37.485 --> 03:39.853
- That's what you
thought I'd say?
- More like hoping?

03:39.887 --> 03:41.889
Who are you?

03:41.922 --> 03:44.525
Please, Lauren?
Come on.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.460
There's no way I could
sneak out by myself.

03:46.494 --> 03:47.961
You've gotta
help me with this.

03:47.995 --> 03:50.230
I never thought
I'd say this, but..

03:50.264 --> 03:52.733
...I need your devious mind.

03:52.766 --> 03:55.303
Ooh, I like the sound of that.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.904
Yes! OK, so what do we do?

03:58.972 --> 04:00.841
- Watch and learn.
- [Payson squeals]

04:05.713 --> 04:07.315
Coast is clear.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.817
Keep your head down
and your kick ass up.

04:09.850 --> 04:13.020
As long as nobody sees you,
you're in the clear. Easy peasy.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.928
It's one minute to curfew.
Get in here!

04:23.964 --> 04:25.399
[techno music plays]

04:33.874 --> 04:34.908
[man] Who's there?!

04:34.942 --> 04:37.277
- Now what?!
- Get down!

04:37.311 --> 04:40.348
Um, help. I just saw a wrestler
streaking down the hallway!

04:40.381 --> 04:41.582
Seriously?

04:41.615 --> 04:43.851
Hello? Traumatized girl
standing here!

04:48.288 --> 04:49.723
Like naked streaking?

04:49.757 --> 04:53.293
Do you need me to paint you
a picture? Come on, let's go!

04:53.327 --> 04:55.563
* I wanna lean
on a pillow of steam *

04:55.596 --> 04:57.998
* I wanna dance on the sun
Not get burned *

04:58.031 --> 04:59.833
* The chance taker in me

04:59.867 --> 05:02.936
* One in a million
In a million *

05:02.970 --> 05:04.838
- [squeals]
- [laughs]

05:04.872 --> 05:07.508
* One in a million
In a million *

05:07.541 --> 05:08.709
* One in a million *

05:08.742 --> 05:10.878
Marcus was right.

05:10.911 --> 05:13.381
This is gonna
be a death match to the finish.

05:13.414 --> 05:15.916
There are a lot
of impressive girls here.

05:15.949 --> 05:20.020
I hope you're ready
for another Dream Team in 2012.

05:20.053 --> 05:22.923
I'm not only ready for it,
I'm requiring it.

05:22.956 --> 05:25.292
You and I have a lot
to prove here, Mac.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.761
So, I'm up to speed
on their skills,

05:27.795 --> 05:31.031
but I need to know...
How are the girls doing?

05:31.064 --> 05:33.967
I just spent three hours
telling you how they're doing.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.969
I don't mean on the mat.
I mean up here.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.638
How are they behaving?

05:37.671 --> 05:40.073
You know the mental game
is the deciding factor
in this sport.

05:40.107 --> 05:44.077
They're good. Focused.
Determined. They all want it.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.546
No disciplinary problems?

05:45.579 --> 05:48.382
Not a one.
I got it all under control.

05:48.416 --> 05:49.917
Glad to hear it.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.090
Anything wrong?

06:00.360 --> 06:02.095
Nothing I can't handle.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.538
[crowd cheering]

06:16.410 --> 06:18.111
[low-tempo pop music plays]

06:24.084 --> 06:28.456
* Between these lines

06:28.489 --> 06:31.559
* Behind each light

06:31.592 --> 06:33.093
- [both] Big Dipper!
- I win.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.629
No way, I totally
saw it first!

06:35.663 --> 06:38.699
Well, I guess we'll have
to leave it up to the judges.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.101
- [detector whirring]
- What's that all about?

06:41.134 --> 06:45.939
Oh, the volleyball players
buried Otis somewhere
on campus for safe keeping.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.808
The gymnasts
have never gotten Otis,
and I want to change that.

06:47.841 --> 06:48.909
Come on, let's follow them!

06:48.942 --> 06:50.377
[laughs] You are by far

06:50.410 --> 06:52.746
the most competitive girl
I have ever dated.

06:52.780 --> 06:57.384
Well, when you catch
Olympic fever at age six,
it makes you kind of intense.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.553
Hmm. You know,
five years ago,

06:59.587 --> 07:01.889
BMX wasn't even
an Olympic sport.

07:01.922 --> 07:05.993
Oh, the Olympics is all
Kaylie, Lauren, and I
have talked about for years.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.427
The only thing
that never came up

07:07.461 --> 07:08.929
was who would take home
the gold.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.097
Now that the games
are so close,

07:10.130 --> 07:11.499
you must all
be thinking about it.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.000
Well, I know I am.

07:13.033 --> 07:16.069
[attempts British accent]
You think when you and I
win gold in London,

07:16.103 --> 07:19.607
the queen will invite
us over for a spot o' tea?

07:19.640 --> 07:21.108
[British accent]
I do say, chum,

07:21.141 --> 07:23.043
your British accent
bloody stinks.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.978
Oh? Oh-ho.

07:30.584 --> 07:32.753
Totally worth it!

07:32.786 --> 07:35.556
Have a nice night out, Keeler?

07:35.589 --> 07:38.726
- Um, we were out of shampoo?
- [McIntire] Save it.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.561
Sneaking out
after curfew tells me

07:40.594 --> 07:42.563
you two must not need
an extra day of practice.

07:42.596 --> 07:46.066
So... change of plans.

07:46.099 --> 07:50.638
Team Keeler/Tanner will now
be performing on day one
of eliminations.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.940
- That's not fair!
- No, Lauren didn't sneak out.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.075
It was just me.
Please don't blame her for this.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.677
You two are teammates.

07:56.710 --> 07:59.112
That means Tanner's responsible
for your bad decisions

07:59.146 --> 08:01.214
just like
you are for hers.

08:05.753 --> 08:08.522
- [door closes]
- How did he find out?

08:08.556 --> 08:11.592
The mole strikes again.

08:11.625 --> 08:14.795
[woman laughing] I agree.
You're absolutely right.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.496
- Let me get this for you.
After you, my dear.
- Oh.

08:16.530 --> 08:18.632
No, go ahead.
You got the pretty shoes.

08:18.666 --> 08:21.468
I mean,
what the hell ever happened
to the shoe horn, right?

08:21.501 --> 08:24.738
So, really, you're not gonna
hate me if I actually get
those, too, huh?

08:24.772 --> 08:26.840
- They look fantastic on you.
- Have at it.

08:26.874 --> 08:29.242
They really do.
I have to tell you, Regina,

08:29.276 --> 08:33.246
Kelly and I were so happy
when you finally got
the job you deserve. Really.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.015
Head of the NGO
Olympic Committee?

08:35.048 --> 08:37.217
I mean, I have been telling
Ellen Beals for years

08:37.250 --> 08:39.787
there is no one smarter
in this game than you. Really.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.489
Oh, speak of the devil.
Isn't that right, Kelly?

08:42.522 --> 08:44.257
Haven't we both been
singing her praises?

08:44.291 --> 08:45.826
Yeah.

08:45.859 --> 08:49.096
Excuse me, I really do need
to confab with McIntire.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.098
[Sheila] Oh, all right.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.567
It was fun to talk.

08:53.601 --> 08:54.935
- Mom?
- What?

08:54.968 --> 08:57.004
You told me the only reason you
were here was to work PR

08:57.037 --> 08:59.172
for that independent
sports blogger.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.108
What are you doing
kissing up to the NGO?

09:01.141 --> 09:03.977
Relax. I bumped into her
in the parking lot.

09:04.011 --> 09:06.246
She was admiring my boots.
She wants to buy some.

09:06.279 --> 09:09.216
Would you like me to be rude?
I'll be rude.

09:09.249 --> 09:12.185
- Hi, Mrs. Baboyon!
- Oh, hi.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.654
How does she know you?

09:13.687 --> 09:16.556
Oh, she's been hounding me
to represent her
since we got here.

09:16.590 --> 09:18.926
- You're not going to do it,
are you?
- Please. Come on.

09:18.959 --> 09:23.263
Although, I do have an opening
for a gymnast to represent

09:23.296 --> 09:25.265
since my daughter
dumped me. Hm?

09:25.298 --> 09:28.201
We all know there's only room
for one star in this sport.

09:28.235 --> 09:31.939
And that my dear, gorgeous,

09:31.972 --> 09:36.644
competitive,
champion daughter is you.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.245
- OK?
- Yeah.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.279
All right.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.014
It's just the thought of you

09:41.048 --> 09:43.116
representing
my own competition is so weird.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.752
I know. Well, the thought of you

09:44.785 --> 09:47.955
not thinking Kaylie Cruz
is your competition is weirder.

09:47.988 --> 09:50.157
Kaylie's been my rock through
all the ups and downs here.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.759
I don't know
what I'd do without her.

09:51.792 --> 09:54.061
Trust me. You'll do fine
without her, OK?

09:54.094 --> 09:56.596
You are gonna win
that Olympic gold on your own.

09:56.630 --> 09:57.998
- OK. Yeah.
- All right?

09:58.031 --> 09:59.733
- All right?
- OK.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.368
Work hard.

10:04.004 --> 10:07.240
Oh! I finally figured it out.

10:07.274 --> 10:10.610
OK, you must be related
to Coach McIntire, yeah?

10:10.644 --> 10:12.946
What? No. Why would you...?

10:12.980 --> 10:15.048
Well, I don't know,
I just thought...

10:15.082 --> 10:17.017
I kind of thought...
You know, because...

10:17.050 --> 10:18.752
[scoffs]

10:18.786 --> 10:20.220
You mean, because I'm...

10:20.253 --> 10:22.289
Yeah, I just assumed
that you're related.

10:22.322 --> 10:25.625
I just... I couldn't think
of any other reason
why you'd be here.

10:30.297 --> 10:33.801
According to our latest intel,
Jin Zyeu from China just
perfected a new super move.

10:33.834 --> 10:36.770
If that's true,
we need to trump it
with a super move of our own

10:36.804 --> 10:39.172
or find a way to be
happy with silver.

10:39.206 --> 10:41.341
Don't even say the "S" word.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.615
I hear you've gotten
Jordan Randall

10:48.648 --> 10:50.283
to take her layout Jordan move
out of retirement.

10:50.317 --> 10:53.286
- I'm working on it.
- It just doesn't make
any sense.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.724
The move was named after her,
but she's refused
to perform it for years.

10:56.757 --> 10:59.426
She might be too headstrong
for this sport.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.296
You want a super move?

11:05.032 --> 11:08.168
Randall is close to landing
a triple back dismount on bars.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.637
Jordan Randall is your big hope
for shutting down China?

11:10.670 --> 11:12.940
We don't have time
to waste here, Mac.

11:12.973 --> 11:16.176
We took a chance once
on an unfocused, obstinate
gymnast in Boulder,

11:16.209 --> 11:17.778
and it backfired.

11:17.811 --> 11:20.080
She just might have the move
that's the answer to China.

11:20.113 --> 11:21.448
But does she have this?

11:25.986 --> 11:28.822
[sighs] It's bad enough
Coach moved us up a day,

11:28.856 --> 11:31.358
but to give that little snitch
and her Cabbage Patch sidekick

11:31.391 --> 11:33.260
our day two spot is seriously
more than I can take.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.295
Me, too, but there's just
nothing we can do about it.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.430
Are you guys waiting?
Can I run a quick routine?

11:37.464 --> 11:40.267
Get in line.
Queen of Jordan has been
hogging the mat all morning.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.870
All right, don't start a war.
She's not worth it.

11:44.237 --> 11:46.373
Besides, we're already
in trouble with the coach.

11:46.406 --> 11:50.443
- Dude, what's your problem?
- You may think being
all La Femme Nikita

11:50.477 --> 11:53.080
and spying on us is gonna make
the coach put you on the team,

11:53.113 --> 11:56.784
but all you're really doing,
Jordan, is making us hate you.

11:56.817 --> 11:59.386
- I'm not here to make friends.
- Hm.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.291
- Did Jordan...?
- Yep.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.493
She just admitted
to being the mole.

12:15.468 --> 12:18.105
Oh, my God!
What are you doing here?

12:18.138 --> 12:19.940
- Hello, Kaylie.
- Is that my perfume?!

12:19.973 --> 12:23.443
Yeah, I was just smelling it.
It's a good scent, actually.
It's, uh...

12:23.476 --> 12:26.346
Ooh! It's very, uh...
It's very bohemian.

12:26.379 --> 12:29.482
I like it. Obviously,
I'm looking for Kelly.

12:29.516 --> 12:33.386
- Well, obviously
she's not here.
- Oh! Oh.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.489
Oh, you know what?
You're absolutely right.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.391
She told me
to meet her at the quad.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.928
- Oh, great...
- I'm sorry.

12:40.961 --> 12:43.897
You know, when I get hungry,
I get very forgetful

12:43.931 --> 12:45.999
and lightheaded
and off-balance.

12:46.033 --> 12:48.435
Well, you... you know
how that is, right?

12:48.468 --> 12:50.770
- So then, I guess
you'll be leaving.
- Yeah.

12:50.804 --> 12:55.442
You know what though, Kaylie?
I am glad that we
bumped into each other.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.444
I've been worried
about you, honey.

12:57.477 --> 13:00.513
You know, what with your...
[whispers] ...your eating
disorder and everything.

13:00.547 --> 13:03.483
I know the stress
of the NGO eliminations

13:03.516 --> 13:07.120
must wreak havoc
on your fragile mental state.

13:07.154 --> 13:09.056
You OK, sweetie?

13:09.089 --> 13:11.391
I'm on to all your games,
Sheila.

13:11.424 --> 13:15.195
I'm honestly telling you,
as a mother, I'm concerned
about you.

13:15.228 --> 13:20.333
Well, thank you,
but I have a wonderful mother,
unlike Kelly.

13:20.367 --> 13:23.803
Wow. Well, as long
as we're being honest,

13:23.837 --> 13:25.805
you freaky little toothpick,

13:25.839 --> 13:29.042
I know that you think you're
besties with my daughter,

13:29.076 --> 13:32.212
but when push comes to shove...

13:32.245 --> 13:35.348
...Kelly is going to bury
your bony ass.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.918
- God, you don't
know her at all.
- Oh, no.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.319
- But, guess what?
- Hm?

13:39.352 --> 13:41.088
- I do.
- Hm.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.156
Because she's my dear friend,

13:43.190 --> 13:47.995
and I love that that screws
with your fragile mental state.

13:48.028 --> 13:50.497
Well, thank you, but Kelly
doesn't need friends.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.399
She has me,
her momma.

13:52.432 --> 13:55.368
And if you know
what's good for you,

13:55.402 --> 13:59.506
you will back off
and stop messing
with her competitive edge, OK?

13:59.539 --> 14:03.210
This was a great visit.
I had a great time. Thank you.

14:03.243 --> 14:04.511
Hope we can
do it again.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.846
Oh! And, uh, Kaylie?

14:06.880 --> 14:08.515
For God's sake, honey...

14:10.217 --> 14:11.851
...would you eat something?

14:11.885 --> 14:13.420
Come on.

14:23.030 --> 14:25.232
So, your mom
found me today.

14:25.265 --> 14:28.135
I know, she told me.
Well, I told her
how stressed out I've been

14:28.168 --> 14:31.204
and how you've been my rock,
and she just wanted
to say thank you.

14:31.238 --> 14:34.474
Every now and then
she surprises me by doing
something really sweet.

14:34.507 --> 14:38.411
Yeah, she's
full of surprises.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.086
Hey. Dr. Curtis just called.

14:46.119 --> 14:49.322
She was wondering why
you're not scheduled to see
a cardiologist for two weeks!

14:49.356 --> 14:52.492
- You said you were
going after cuts!
- Two weeks is after cuts.

14:52.525 --> 14:54.861
It was the soonest
he had an opening.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.164
Look, if a specialist
in the field

14:57.197 --> 15:01.168
isn't worried about my heart
giving out any minute,
you shouldn't, either.

15:01.201 --> 15:03.136
I'm sure if he knew you were
an Olympic-level athlete

15:03.170 --> 15:06.306
that puts extra stress
on her heart, he would
fit you in right away.

15:06.339 --> 15:08.908
If there's anything adding
to my stress level, it's you.

15:08.942 --> 15:11.244
Now, please, spare my heart
and get off my back.

15:13.981 --> 15:15.382
I'm guessing they'll
want to see my floor,

15:15.415 --> 15:18.051
but I think I can really
impress them with bars, too.

15:18.085 --> 15:21.588
Yeah, I can't imagine they'd
actually make some of us
perform in all four events.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.991
I hope not.

15:24.024 --> 15:26.026
She's just trying
to psych us out.

15:26.059 --> 15:28.661
I'm sure the plan is to focus
on two routines per girl.

15:28.695 --> 15:32.165
Two routines gives them
a pretty good picture
of what we bring to the table.

15:32.199 --> 15:35.568
Then you better hope one
of them isn't your beam.
You know you can't beat mine.

15:35.602 --> 15:39.272
My double illusion can match
your crackle and pop any day.

15:39.306 --> 15:40.640
Oh, sassy!

15:40.673 --> 15:43.910
Someone told me a few years ago
they sent five girls home.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.313
But other years
it's only been one or two.

15:47.981 --> 15:51.318
Do you think Coach McIntire gets
the last word on who makes it?

15:52.319 --> 15:54.354
I'll bet Jordan's
counting on that.

15:54.387 --> 15:58.391
That's why the talentless hack
spies on us and feeds him info.

15:58.425 --> 16:01.461
Jordan's a lot of things,
but talentless isn't
one of them.

16:01.494 --> 16:04.697
When she lands
her triple back dismount,
it's really amazing.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.566
And she's been landing it
more and more.

16:09.369 --> 16:11.371
[rock music plays]

16:30.323 --> 16:33.360
- [panting]
- [McIntire] That's it!

16:33.393 --> 16:37.997
You're officially sticking
your triple back dismount
50 percent of the time.

16:38.031 --> 16:41.034
However, you do need
another power move.

16:41.068 --> 16:44.271
Yeah, I want to show them
my Yurchenko full on vault.
It's really strong.

16:44.304 --> 16:47.974
You want to impress
the NGO Olympic Committee?
Show them your layout Jordan.

16:48.007 --> 16:52.011
It blows away the Chenko full,
and it's the move
that defines you.

16:52.045 --> 16:56.283
No, it's not! I am so sick
of everybody asking me
to do that stupid trick.

16:56.316 --> 16:59.552
Listen, people want to see you
do it because you created it.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.988
It's a strong move
with a high DOD.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.591
No. OK, I've told you
that skill is in my past.

17:04.624 --> 17:07.560
- I've grown as a gymnast.
- It's your signature move,

17:07.594 --> 17:09.429
and I think the committee's
gonna want to see it.

17:09.462 --> 17:12.765
If you do it
at the NGO eliminations,
I think you're a shoo-in.

17:12.799 --> 17:16.303
- And if I don't?
- Then you better make
your triple back dismount stick.

17:16.336 --> 17:19.272
'Cause if you don't,
I can't guarantee anything.

17:23.310 --> 17:26.646
What would you do
if letting your friend
compete could hurt her,

17:26.679 --> 17:29.482
but stopping her would ruin
everything she's worked for?

17:29.516 --> 17:32.452
If your friend is willing
to put her neck on the line
for her goal,

17:32.485 --> 17:36.022
- that's her responsibility.
Not yours.
- She's my teammate.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.258
[imitates McIntire]
I'm responsible for
her bad decisions in the gym.

17:38.291 --> 17:41.027
So we're talking about Lauren.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.364
She's passed out cold a couple
of times since we got here.

17:44.397 --> 17:47.400
One minute, she's
completely fine, and the next,
she's on the floor.

17:47.434 --> 17:50.337
But if you don't know when one
of these attacks is going down,

17:50.370 --> 17:52.239
then there's not much
you can do about it.

17:52.272 --> 17:56.509
I think I do. She does this,
like, thing before it happens.

17:56.543 --> 17:58.545
It's like she loses circulation
in her fingers

17:58.578 --> 18:00.613
and is trying to push
blood back into them.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.549
- But it doesn't
happen all the time?
- No.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.551
But what if it happens
at the wrong time,

18:04.584 --> 18:08.255
like when she's 15 feet
in the air above the bars? I...

18:08.288 --> 18:10.757
[sighs] I know
what I have to do.

18:10.790 --> 18:15.094
Payson, you and I both know
what it's like spending years

18:15.128 --> 18:18.331
sacrificing time with the people
you love to be the best
at your sport.

18:18.365 --> 18:21.601
Nursing bruises
and broken bones,
year after year,

18:21.634 --> 18:25.305
for just one minute standing
on that Olympic podium

18:25.338 --> 18:28.508
and feeling the weight
of that sweet-ass gold medal
around your neck.

18:28.541 --> 18:31.611
Are you really gonna
be the one to take
that chance away from her?

18:33.746 --> 18:36.149
I can't believe you're
telling me to do nothing.

18:36.183 --> 18:37.484
What if it were me?

18:37.517 --> 18:40.353
What if I was doing something
that was putting my life
in danger?

18:40.387 --> 18:41.821
Would you just
let me kill myself?

18:41.854 --> 18:43.456
Payson, come on.
You're my girlfriend,

18:43.490 --> 18:44.757
I wouldn't let
anything happen to you.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.427
Oh, so just because we make out,
you have to protect me?

18:47.460 --> 18:49.696
You asked for my opinion.
I gave it to you.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.831
I don't know what else
you expect me to say.

18:51.864 --> 18:54.133
I expect you to tell me
to do the right thing.

18:54.167 --> 18:57.504
No, you want me to tell you
what you want to hear.

18:57.537 --> 19:01.641
Don't worry. The next time
I need someone to count on,
I won't come to you.

19:30.703 --> 19:33.206
- Lauren, maybe we should...
- We're ready for you.

19:35.375 --> 19:38.478
After today, we've got
just one more hurdle
on our way to the Olympics.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.512
Let's rock this!

19:44.851 --> 19:47.354
Keeler, you're up first.

19:47.387 --> 19:50.357
- Let's see your beam routine.
- You got it, Pay.

20:01.834 --> 20:04.604
[rock music plays]

20:11.511 --> 20:14.547
* Is that all you got?

20:14.581 --> 20:16.916
* Is that all you got?

20:16.949 --> 20:19.352
* Is that all you got?

20:19.386 --> 20:20.920
* I think you're hot

20:26.826 --> 20:30.430
* Hey, hey, hey

20:34.334 --> 20:35.702
* I think you're hot

20:35.735 --> 20:37.270
Thank you, Payson.
That'll be all.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.539
Just one routine? You don't want
to see anything else?

20:39.572 --> 20:41.441
We're good.
Tanner, you're up.

20:44.344 --> 20:46.613
* Is that all you got?

20:46.646 --> 20:49.382
* Is that all you got?

20:49.416 --> 20:51.418
* Yo, is that all you got?

20:59.592 --> 21:02.462
* Hey, hey, hey

21:07.434 --> 21:09.702
* I think you're hot

21:09.736 --> 21:11.571
* I think you're hot

21:12.839 --> 21:14.641
* Don't deny

21:17.344 --> 21:18.611
* Is that all you got?

21:19.679 --> 21:21.047
* Is that all you got?

21:22.515 --> 21:23.716
* Is that all you got?

21:25.017 --> 21:27.286
* Is that all you got?

21:44.003 --> 21:45.805
[McIntire] Any time
you're ready, Lauren.

21:56.649 --> 21:59.352
You've gotta stop her!
She can't do this.
You can't let her do this!

22:22.041 --> 22:24.677
[muffled arguing]

22:32.419 --> 22:35.722
What's going on?
What did they say?

22:39.926 --> 22:41.428
Tanner's done.

22:48.835 --> 22:52.004
I just...
I couldn't let her do it.

22:52.038 --> 22:54.774
If she'd have fallen, I never
would have forgiven myself.

22:54.807 --> 22:58.478
It's OK now. OK?
She's at the medical center.

22:58.511 --> 23:01.481
They'll get this
all straightened out.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.016
Lauren will never forgive me.

23:04.050 --> 23:06.653
Yes, she will.

23:06.686 --> 23:09.121
And you didn't have
to go through this alone.

23:09.155 --> 23:10.723
Why didn't you
come to me?

23:10.757 --> 23:14.026
I don't know. Because
I was protecting her secret.

23:15.628 --> 23:20.066
And we both know things have
been a little tense between us.

23:21.468 --> 23:24.504
You and me and Lauren...

23:24.537 --> 23:26.473
...we're gonna get
through this together.

23:26.506 --> 23:29.509
Just like we always have.

23:30.176 --> 23:31.711
OK?

23:35.848 --> 23:38.685
What are you talking about?
This is a good thing.

23:38.718 --> 23:41.621
I mean, it's one less girl
to contend with, right?

23:41.654 --> 23:44.557
[scoffs] One of my friends
has a heart problem,
and all you can think about

23:44.591 --> 23:45.992
is how it helps
out my career?

23:46.025 --> 23:48.895
[groans] There's that word
"friends" again. Friends!

23:48.928 --> 23:52.131
This isn't a sorority house.
It's a training center.

23:52.164 --> 23:54.701
You have to keep
your eye on the prize.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.969
[sighs]

23:57.003 --> 24:00.006
Come on, angel.
Look at me.

24:00.039 --> 24:02.809
We've both worked
so hard to get here.

24:02.842 --> 24:06.746
Come on. You don't wanna
let Momma down when we're
so close, right?

24:07.547 --> 24:09.482
Promise Momma?

24:09.516 --> 24:10.617
I promise.

24:10.650 --> 24:13.019
Your eyes look so pretty
with that orange.

24:14.587 --> 24:15.988
OK, you need
to get some rest.

24:16.022 --> 24:18.057
You need to impress
those judges tomorrow, OK?

24:19.559 --> 24:20.660
OK, Mom.

24:20.693 --> 24:24.430
Remember, we're in this
together, all right?

24:24.463 --> 24:26.633
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Yeah.

24:26.666 --> 24:29.168
OK, my angel.
My star.

24:29.201 --> 24:31.037
- Yeah.
- Right.

24:33.673 --> 24:35.074
[door opens]

24:36.743 --> 24:38.678
[door closes]

24:42.682 --> 24:44.517
[knocking at door]

24:51.057 --> 24:52.458
Is your mom here?

24:52.491 --> 24:54.093
No, she just left.

24:54.126 --> 24:55.662
Shoot!

24:57.263 --> 25:00.066
Do me a fave?
Give her these.

25:00.099 --> 25:01.768
Did she leave these somewhere?

25:01.801 --> 25:03.670
No, silly. It's my contract.

25:03.703 --> 25:06.172
Your mom is totes
my manager now!

25:06.205 --> 25:09.676
I'm like
a younger, newer... you!

25:09.709 --> 25:11.043
[giggles]

25:11.077 --> 25:12.779
She's gonna make me a star!

25:12.812 --> 25:16.583
- What?
- Whoops!

25:16.616 --> 25:18.985
Um, did she not tell you?

25:20.553 --> 25:22.922
Awkward. Oh...

25:27.526 --> 25:29.295
[pop ballad plays]

25:46.879 --> 25:50.216
Thank you, Wendy.
That should be it for today.

25:50.249 --> 25:52.919
Thank you, coach.
It felt really good.

25:55.554 --> 25:58.190
Does it ever
not feel "really good"?

25:58.224 --> 25:59.826
No.

25:59.859 --> 26:01.160
[Regina] We've heard
so much about your bars

26:01.193 --> 26:03.262
and that triple
layout dismount, Jordan.

26:03.295 --> 26:05.564
I can't wait to see it.

26:08.134 --> 26:12.672
* He's waited for this moment

26:12.705 --> 26:15.541
* To start over

26:15.574 --> 26:20.813
* Well, it's been in your heart
and it's in your head *

26:20.847 --> 26:23.049
[singer vocalizing]

26:35.261 --> 26:39.098
* It's just a stand
into the sky *

26:39.131 --> 26:43.002
* Before you fall
into a high *

26:43.035 --> 26:46.939
* It's just a stand
into the sky *

26:46.973 --> 26:50.977
* Before you fall
into a high *

26:51.010 --> 26:54.213
* It's just a stand
into the sky *

26:54.246 --> 26:59.285
* Before you fall
into a high *

26:59.318 --> 27:00.787
She didn't land it.
She sunk it.

27:00.820 --> 27:02.354
It's not the power move
we need, Mac.

27:02.388 --> 27:04.123
Yeah, but it can be.

27:04.156 --> 27:06.392
They give gold medals
for potential now?

27:07.660 --> 27:09.896
Jordan, we'd like
to see your vault.

27:09.929 --> 27:12.631
- What will you
be showing us?
- My Yurchenko full.

27:14.901 --> 27:17.236
We'd rather see
your layout Jordan.

27:17.269 --> 27:19.672
It's been too long
since anyone's seen her do it.

27:19.706 --> 27:21.340
Give me a minute.

27:23.275 --> 27:24.944
I'm not doing it.

27:24.977 --> 27:26.946
- You want to stay here,
don't you?
- What do you think?

27:26.979 --> 27:31.217
Ms. Randall, either we see
the layout Jordan,
or we're finished here.

27:34.220 --> 27:37.990
Better give them what they want.
Come on, you got this.

27:51.003 --> 27:53.072
It's Emily Kmetko
all over again.

27:55.374 --> 28:00.112
I fired her because I was tired
of having a stay-at-work mom,
but nothing has changed.

28:00.146 --> 28:03.249
I'm not her daughter. I'm just
her dream of Olympic gold.

28:03.282 --> 28:06.285
And without that I don't
matter to her at all.

28:06.318 --> 28:10.256
It's not about her dream.
It's about yours.

28:10.289 --> 28:14.326
Your mother won't be standing up
on that podium with you.

28:14.360 --> 28:17.864
You know what my Olympic dream
has really been?

28:17.897 --> 28:21.200
I win the gold,
and I finally get away from her.

28:21.233 --> 28:25.738
KP, you don't need
a gold medal to do that.

28:25.772 --> 28:29.809
I always thought
somehow a gold medal
would make me stronger.

28:29.842 --> 28:31.744
Are you kidding?

28:31.778 --> 28:36.148
You are one
of the strongest girls I know.

28:36.182 --> 28:39.418
If you could just believe that,
you'll be free.

28:41.187 --> 28:43.856
Now, wipe those tears

28:43.890 --> 28:48.360
and let's go show these judges
how this sport is really done!

28:48.394 --> 28:50.496
- All right.
- Thank you.

28:51.397 --> 28:52.731
Come on.

28:52.765 --> 28:54.901

29:26.232 --> 29:31.170

* Don't you know

30:17.349 --> 30:20.219
I'm satisfied.
Everyone else?

30:22.121 --> 30:23.489
Thank you, ladies.
That's all.

30:23.522 --> 30:28.060
* You and I are almost there
Don't you know *

30:34.033 --> 30:36.235
[Regina] OK, who do we
have left to talk about?

30:36.268 --> 30:39.271
Jordan Randall.
My vote would be to keep her.

30:39.305 --> 30:41.273
Every week she gets
better and better,

30:41.307 --> 30:44.010
and there's still time
for her to master
that triple back dismount.

30:44.043 --> 30:45.511
- Mac...
- I know what you're
going to say.

30:45.544 --> 30:48.180
"Mac, that move has never been
done in competition before."

30:48.214 --> 30:51.984
But if she pulls it off,
we'll give China
a run for their money.

30:52.018 --> 30:54.853
That's a big "if". And after
that stunt she pulled today,

30:54.887 --> 30:57.323
I worry she's
more of a loose cannon
than a serious threat.

30:57.356 --> 31:01.360
To win gold, we need
consistently strong performers
like Kelly Parker.

31:01.393 --> 31:04.263
I've been tracking her progress
since her win at Worlds
two years ago,

31:04.296 --> 31:07.299
and she hasn't been progressing
like the other girls have.

31:07.333 --> 31:11.270
Now, consistency is great,
but you really only need
one workhorse on the team.

31:11.303 --> 31:13.272
And we have
Payson Keeler for that.

31:13.305 --> 31:15.407
You really think
she's more consistent
than Kelly Parker?

31:17.343 --> 31:20.146
Let's move on. Um...

31:20.179 --> 31:21.981
What do we think
of Wendy Capshaw?

31:22.014 --> 31:24.350
There's only one thing
we know that wins it all...

31:24.383 --> 31:27.019
...athleticism and flash.

31:27.053 --> 31:28.387
- And she's got both.
- [Regina] Agreed.

31:28.420 --> 31:31.057
If I was fighting for a spot
on the Olympic team,

31:31.090 --> 31:33.125
she'd be the one
I would worry about beating.

31:33.159 --> 31:35.561
The truth is all
of these girls are great.

31:35.594 --> 31:37.363
But not all of them
are Olympians.

31:37.396 --> 31:40.532
Today is about eliminating
anyone we feel

31:40.566 --> 31:43.302
won't benefit
by remaining here any longer.

31:46.272 --> 31:49.308
All right. Looks like it's time
to send some girls home.

31:56.983 --> 31:59.585
I suppose you're going
to say I told you so.

31:59.618 --> 32:02.688
Ah, I'd rather say
I'm glad you called.

32:04.056 --> 32:06.358
Lauren won't
even talk to me.

32:07.593 --> 32:09.461
You did what you
thought was right.

32:09.495 --> 32:12.898
- She put you in a tough place.
- I know, right?

32:12.931 --> 32:15.334
Well, if she's
done with me, then...

32:16.435 --> 32:18.570
...I guess
I'm done with her.

32:20.372 --> 32:22.975
Lauren is a part
of your family.

32:23.009 --> 32:26.045
And where I come from, you never
give up on your family.

32:26.078 --> 32:28.714
No matter how hard
they make it for you.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.417
Lauren may not be able
to see it,

32:31.450 --> 32:35.021
but right now she is going
to need you more than ever.

32:40.359 --> 32:41.960
Everything OK?

32:43.162 --> 32:44.430
The list is up.

32:45.164 --> 32:46.165
Good luck!

32:55.274 --> 32:56.708
[sobs]

32:59.378 --> 33:00.746
I knew I'd sail through.

33:05.651 --> 33:07.653
Oh, we made it!

33:10.522 --> 33:13.259
[Kaylie] But... KP didn't.

33:19.498 --> 33:22.234
- Are you OK?
- I will be.

33:22.268 --> 33:24.070
I can't believe this!

33:24.103 --> 33:27.539
[sighs] I can.

33:27.573 --> 33:29.175
The truth is
I peaked at Worlds,

33:29.208 --> 33:33.379
and I have been trying to fight
my way back ever since and...

33:33.412 --> 33:35.547
...I just couldn't keep up
with all of you,
and the judges saw it.

33:35.581 --> 33:39.418
All right, enough!
Enough of this damn love-fest!

33:39.451 --> 33:41.353
All right, see?
Are you happy now?

33:41.387 --> 33:44.323
Look. Look what happened
when you're friends
with the competition!

33:44.356 --> 33:47.059
- Are you happy, Kelly?
- Having friends is not
the reason I got cut.

33:47.093 --> 33:49.061
And it's the only thing
holding me together right now.

33:49.095 --> 33:52.564
You know what? The folks
at the NGO are not gonna
be happy about this.

33:52.598 --> 33:56.102
They are not gonna
be happy when they find out
that Coach McStupid

33:56.135 --> 33:58.437
tossed their shining star!
But I tell you,

33:58.470 --> 34:02.541
I'm gonna fix this.
I will fix this if
it's the last thing I do.

34:02.574 --> 34:06.345
- There is nothing to fix!
- Oh, come on.
What are you, blind?!

34:06.378 --> 34:08.514
Come on, everybody knows
that the reason you got cut

34:08.547 --> 34:11.250
and that little orphan Jordan,
is still here... We know why.

34:11.283 --> 34:12.751
Jordan is just better than me.

34:12.784 --> 34:15.521
Kelly, better has
nothing to do with it.

34:15.554 --> 34:19.158
What, you think
it's a coincidence
that the black coach

34:19.191 --> 34:21.527
kept the only little black girl
in the running?

34:22.494 --> 34:24.496
I will not let this gym

34:24.530 --> 34:26.765
make my daughter into
an Affirmative Action victim.

34:26.798 --> 34:29.501
- I won't let that happen.
- Enough!

34:29.535 --> 34:31.303
Race has nothing
to do with this!

34:31.337 --> 34:34.140
[scoffs] Come on, Kelly!
Stop being so naive!

34:34.173 --> 34:36.775
No. Not anymore.

34:36.808 --> 34:40.512
I am quitting this sport,
and there is nothing
you can do about it.

34:40.546 --> 34:43.048
Well, guess what?

34:43.081 --> 34:47.319
You absolutely are
not quitting this sport

34:47.353 --> 34:50.556
after all I have
given up for you,
you spoiled little brat!

34:50.589 --> 34:53.559
- Now you can focus
on your new client, Wendy.
- Who?

34:53.592 --> 34:56.195
- Did I hear my name?
- Oh, my God.

34:56.228 --> 34:59.531
I was just using
little Miss Sunshine to get
information about these witches

34:59.565 --> 35:01.333
to feed to that coach.

35:01.367 --> 35:03.435
- It was you?
- You're the mole?

35:03.469 --> 35:06.772
I was just talking. That's all.

35:08.507 --> 35:10.676
You know how I blabber on
sometimes, but...

35:10.709 --> 35:14.513
...I swear I had no idea
that she was going to use me
to hurt you.

35:14.546 --> 35:17.082
I am so sorry!

35:17.115 --> 35:20.152
Please, you have to believe me!

35:20.186 --> 35:24.523
Momma has a plan, OK?
I'm gonna get your spot
back for you, all right?

35:25.857 --> 35:29.161
- You're fired.
- You already fired me.

35:29.195 --> 35:30.629
Not as my manager...

35:30.662 --> 35:32.364
...as my mother.

35:33.265 --> 35:35.100
It's Momma.

35:35.133 --> 35:37.803
You can't fire me.
It's your momma.

35:37.836 --> 35:40.706
Momma loves you. Momma cares
about you more than anyone.

35:40.739 --> 35:43.575
- Who loves you as much as I do,
huh? Your father?!
- No!

35:43.609 --> 35:47.446
Nobody loves you
as much as I do!
Kelly, Momma loves you!

35:49.315 --> 35:50.649
Kelly!

35:55.187 --> 35:57.223
So, you, hm?

35:58.857 --> 36:00.626
You knew from the beginning

36:00.659 --> 36:05.597
that I would go and tell
all that information
to that coach.

36:05.631 --> 36:10.636
Actually, when I met you the day
you dropped off KP for camp?

36:10.669 --> 36:13.539
I was interested
in representation.

36:13.572 --> 36:15.874
Then when I told you
that the girls snuck
into the gym

36:15.907 --> 36:19.611
and somehow Coach found out,

36:19.645 --> 36:23.549
I knew I'd found something
much better than a manager...

36:23.582 --> 36:27.453
my own personal snitch.

36:28.587 --> 36:32.591
You lying, disgusting,

36:32.624 --> 36:35.427
perky piece of work.

36:35.461 --> 36:38.897
Coming from you,
I take that as a compliment.

36:38.930 --> 36:43.269
I'll just tell those girls
the truth, and your little game
will be over.

36:43.302 --> 36:45.571
Wouldn't matter
what you said now.

36:45.604 --> 36:49.408
Nobody would
believe you over... me.

36:49.441 --> 36:54.546
Besides, I'm taking
The Rock girls down,

36:54.580 --> 36:58.717
which is what you've
always wanted.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.254
You're welcome.

37:04.723 --> 37:07.926
Watch your back.

37:18.270 --> 37:19.771
[pop ballad plays]

37:22.774 --> 37:25.677
It'll be really weird
not seeing you
on the mat every day.

37:25.711 --> 37:29.481
It's gonna be weird for me, too.
I've practically spent
my entire life in a gym.

37:30.782 --> 37:32.684
KP, are you really
OK with this?

37:33.885 --> 37:36.688
I don't think
I'm going to miss it.

37:36.722 --> 37:40.258
Gymnastics was my life, but...

37:42.561 --> 37:45.731
I'm hoping there's more to me
than just Kelly Parker,
star gymnast.

37:45.764 --> 37:49.801
I'm actually really excited
to see what else
is out there for me.

37:49.835 --> 37:52.438
I called my dad.

37:52.471 --> 37:54.873
Wow! What did he say?

37:54.906 --> 37:56.608
He was really happy I called.

37:56.642 --> 37:58.910
He wants me to come stay
with them for a while.

37:58.944 --> 38:02.481
His wife even got on the phone
and said there's always been
a room waiting for me.

38:02.514 --> 38:04.716
I'm so happy for you.

38:04.750 --> 38:06.485
Thank you.

38:07.819 --> 38:11.289
And you better FaceChat.
I want to know everything.

38:11.323 --> 38:13.625
I will call you
from the airport.

38:13.659 --> 38:15.561
[door closes]

38:15.594 --> 38:17.496
You almost ready, Kaylie?

38:19.498 --> 38:21.767
Yeah.
[clears throat]

38:22.901 --> 38:24.936
Um...

38:24.970 --> 38:27.072
Well, um...

38:31.677 --> 38:33.712
I'm really glad
I got to know you.

38:33.745 --> 38:36.848
It was nice finally
getting to know myself,

38:36.882 --> 38:39.017
and, honestly, I have
you to thank for that.

38:39.050 --> 38:43.489
And we should thank you
for being a tough competitor
all these years.

38:43.522 --> 38:45.991
You made all of us
so much better.

38:50.762 --> 38:52.898
You guys should go.
I'll be fine.

38:54.433 --> 38:56.702
I know you will.

38:56.735 --> 39:00.539
* Falls apart

39:00.572 --> 39:02.641
* Every question opens up

39:02.674 --> 39:04.443
- Bye.
- Bye.

39:06.878 --> 39:10.882
* And how you get lost

39:10.916 --> 39:13.985
* Wandering the hall

39:14.019 --> 39:17.055
* Ohh

39:17.956 --> 39:21.059
* Ohh ohh

39:22.461 --> 39:23.662
You leaving?

39:23.695 --> 39:26.798
Just like you told me to do
when I first got here.

39:26.832 --> 39:28.333
You told me you were
meant to be in that gym.

39:28.366 --> 39:29.968
I am.

39:30.001 --> 39:32.370
What is it
about that move, Jordan,

39:32.404 --> 39:34.540
that makes you willing
to throw everything away?

39:34.573 --> 39:37.743
Hm? I know you can do it.

39:37.776 --> 39:40.479
- I'm just trying
to understand why you won't.
- I just...

39:43.114 --> 39:46.685
Look, I'm sorry, coach.
I just... I can't talk about it.

39:46.718 --> 39:49.621
- Did you look at the list?
- No, I know what it says.

39:49.655 --> 39:51.957
Don't let the door
kick you on the way out.
OK, I'm used to it.

39:51.990 --> 39:54.826
It's like everybody else

39:54.860 --> 39:56.928
knows the secret password,
and I don't.

39:56.962 --> 40:00.365
You know, that chip
on your shoulder isn't
doing you any favors.

40:00.398 --> 40:03.635
Oh, like the favor
you're doing me
by letting me train here?

40:03.669 --> 40:08.707
Like it's inconceivable
to people I could be here
because I'm actually good?

40:08.740 --> 40:10.809
I understand what you're
going through, Jordan.

40:10.842 --> 40:14.546
You think I've had it easy?
In this sport?

40:15.747 --> 40:17.583
I didn't get where I am
without a fight.

40:17.616 --> 40:21.152
It seemed like everywhere
I turned there was resistance
and ignorance.

40:21.186 --> 40:25.757
Unlike you, I learned
that hanging on to my anger
just made life that much harder.

40:25.791 --> 40:30.161
Yeah? Well, my anger
isn't your problem anymore.

40:30.195 --> 40:32.931
- [scoffs] I got a bus to catch.
- No, you don't.

40:37.168 --> 40:39.971
Looks like you know
the secret password after all.

40:43.074 --> 40:45.544
- I'm still here?
- The vote was unanimous.

40:46.812 --> 40:51.583
You hear me? Unanimous.

40:51.617 --> 40:55.987
You are potentially
the biggest threat USA has
this summer,

40:56.021 --> 40:57.889
but you got to focus.

40:57.923 --> 41:00.759
You let the ignorant get
in your head and mess with it,

41:00.792 --> 41:03.562
you got no chance in hell.
Are we clear?

41:03.595 --> 41:05.196
Yes, sir.

41:05.230 --> 41:08.033
You will get
that triple back dismount...

41:09.868 --> 41:11.603
...even if it kills
the both of us.

41:11.637 --> 41:13.171
[laughs]

41:13.204 --> 41:15.941
Well, nobody's dying
on my watch.

41:15.974 --> 41:18.844
I'll get there.
You'll see.

41:20.946 --> 41:23.882
* Ohh ohh

41:25.016 --> 41:26.217
* Ohh ohh

41:26.251 --> 41:27.986
Yes!

41:28.019 --> 41:30.889
* Ohh ohh *

41:32.023 --> 41:33.825
[monitor beeping]

41:53.879 --> 41:54.880
Hi, Lauren.

42:01.086 --> 42:02.187
How are you doing?

42:02.220 --> 42:05.290
Somebody killed
my Olympic dreams today.

42:06.692 --> 42:08.093
But other than that,
I'm great, guys.

42:08.126 --> 42:10.061
You don't know it's over.

42:10.095 --> 42:12.731
- We just have to wait
and see what the doctor says.
- It doesn't matter!

42:12.764 --> 42:14.966
I didn't get to perform!
I got cut!

42:15.000 --> 42:17.168
- Are you happy, Payson?
- Of course I'm not.

42:17.202 --> 42:19.170
I never wanted
any of this to happen.

42:19.204 --> 42:21.272
I just was so scared
you would hurt yourself.

42:21.306 --> 42:22.608
The only thing
you were worried about

42:22.641 --> 42:24.610
was that I was gonna
kick your butt on beam.

42:24.643 --> 42:26.011
You messed up
your double illusion,

42:26.044 --> 42:28.847
so you decided this was
the way to bring me down.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.982
How can you say that?

42:31.016 --> 42:33.752
You... You don't mean that.

42:33.785 --> 42:38.790
I never, ever want to see
your smug, stupid
little face again.

42:38.824 --> 42:41.993
Now get out of my room
and get out of my life!

42:42.027 --> 42:44.830
- Lauren!
- Get out, Payson! Now!

42:44.863 --> 42:47.032
Go!

42:51.036 --> 42:52.604
[door closes]

42:58.176 --> 43:00.912
You know, she only did it
because she loves you.

43:02.981 --> 43:05.884
I would have done
the same thing.

43:11.056 --> 43:12.157
[door opens]

43:14.626 --> 43:15.961
[door closes]

43:28.039 --> 43:30.575
- [sobs]
- It's OK.

43:30.608 --> 43:32.811
It's OK.
