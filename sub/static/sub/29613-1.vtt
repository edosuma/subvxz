00:35.568 --> 00:37.904
My name is
John H. Groberg.

00:41.407 --> 00:44.507
I served my first mission
to Tonga in the 1950s

00:44.509 --> 00:48.313
as a 19-year-old young man
from a small town in Idaho.

00:50.316 --> 00:51.848
The things I experienced there,

00:51.850 --> 00:54.853
the people I met
changed me forever.

00:56.721 --> 00:58.454
The faith of the Tongan people

00:58.456 --> 00:59.856
and their unconditional love

00:59.858 --> 01:01.794
live on in my heart to this day.

01:06.331 --> 01:08.465
When I returned home
after three years,

01:08.467 --> 01:11.602
I married the love
of my life, Jean Sabin.

01:11.604 --> 01:14.938
And we settled in Idaho Falls
where we started our family

01:14.940 --> 01:18.678
which soon included
four vivacious girls.

01:20.479 --> 01:25.349
It was the '60s and the world
was changing in profound ways.

01:25.351 --> 01:28.485
Reeling from President
Kennedy's assassination,

01:28.487 --> 01:30.887
the tragedy of the Vietnam War,

01:30.889 --> 01:35.628
and the eruption of an exuberant
rock and roll counterculture.

01:37.363 --> 01:38.894
But the most powerful
change of all

01:38.896 --> 01:40.831
came when African Americans,

01:40.833 --> 01:44.501
led by a Baptist minister
named Martin Luther King, Jr.,

01:44.503 --> 01:45.837
demanded their civil rights.

01:46.637 --> 01:50.573
I remember watching Dr. King
speak to 200,000 supporters

01:50.575 --> 01:53.576
on the National Mall
in Washington DC.

01:53.578 --> 01:56.513
As I watched him on my little
black and white TV set,

01:56.515 --> 01:58.718
inside my little house
in Idaho Falls...

01:59.652 --> 02:00.784
I have a dream today.

02:00.786 --> 02:02.589
I felt
a familiar spirit.

02:03.788 --> 02:05.688
It was the spirit of
the Tongan ministers

02:05.690 --> 02:06.656
I had heard preach

02:06.658 --> 02:08.791
during my mission to Tonga.

02:08.793 --> 02:10.862
Men whose faith and
works were mighty.

02:12.830 --> 02:15.631
Since that time,
I have known and served

02:15.633 --> 02:18.402
with some of the most wonderful
religious leaders

02:18.404 --> 02:19.639
the world has ever known.

02:20.805 --> 02:24.674
But all these years later,
I can say in all sincerity,

02:24.676 --> 02:27.410
that none of them
were better men

02:27.412 --> 02:30.446
than the humble,
faithful ministers I met

02:30.448 --> 02:31.817
during my time in Tonga.

02:33.418 --> 02:36.920
Those in whose hearts
burns most brightly

02:36.922 --> 02:38.625
the Fire of Faith.

04:23.929 --> 04:26.530
Daddy.

04:30.099 --> 04:30.734
Hey, here we go, ready?

04:30.736 --> 04:32.538
Hup, hey, around.

04:33.905 --> 04:35.138
My turn.

04:35.140 --> 04:36.706
Don't fight
over your daddy.

04:36.708 --> 04:38.708
It's okay,
I have two arms, come here.

04:38.710 --> 04:40.544
- Ready? Off we go.
- Whee.

04:40.546 --> 04:43.612
- Yes.
- Yay.

04:43.614 --> 04:45.682
Ah, now I'm dizzy.

04:45.684 --> 04:46.686
Daddy.

04:58.063 --> 05:00.700
Ah, Jean, that's our song.

05:01.700 --> 05:02.865
Sister Olsen, would you mind?

05:02.867 --> 05:04.100
Absolutely, Bishop.

05:04.102 --> 05:05.669
All right, girls,
you stay with sister Olsen,

05:05.671 --> 05:06.970
it's Mommy's turn.

05:06.972 --> 05:09.108
Let's go, kick off those shoes.

05:11.109 --> 05:12.843
There you go.

05:12.845 --> 05:14.110
Don't overexert yourself.

05:14.112 --> 05:17.614
You'd think I was pregnant
with our fifth baby.

05:17.616 --> 05:19.818
You are.

05:21.953 --> 05:24.987
That's it.

05:27.992 --> 05:30.593
Nice.

05:30.595 --> 05:33.665
Okay, how about this?

05:35.600 --> 05:38.602
And up and over. Yes.

05:38.604 --> 05:40.636
Be careful, Mommy.

05:40.638 --> 05:42.008
Go, Jean!

05:43.975 --> 05:44.976
Beautiful.

05:54.919 --> 05:57.888
Jean, what's wrong, honey?
Are you okay?

05:59.224 --> 06:01.691
Jean, are you all right?

06:01.693 --> 06:02.695
Jean, how can I help?

06:03.895 --> 06:04.895
What's wrong, honey?
How can I help?

06:04.897 --> 06:08.030
I'm just kidding.

06:15.140 --> 06:16.909
Hey!

06:20.712 --> 06:21.744
Still got it.

06:21.746 --> 06:22.978
You still got it.

06:22.980 --> 06:24.013
Come on, girls.

06:24.015 --> 06:26.049
Daddy, yay!

06:26.051 --> 06:27.053
Here, hold my hand.

06:27.619 --> 06:30.220
And apart, and together,

06:30.222 --> 06:32.157
and apart, and...

06:34.792 --> 06:35.927
Yep, watch your step.

06:39.998 --> 06:41.064
Good night, Bishop.

06:41.066 --> 06:42.932
Good night,
Sister Cadmol.

06:42.934 --> 06:44.134
Great party.

06:44.136 --> 06:46.239
Thank you for
coming, Sister Smith.

06:47.739 --> 06:49.075
Whoo.

06:54.011 --> 06:56.146
Sorry to keep you waiting.

06:56.148 --> 06:58.150
Aww.

06:58.717 --> 07:02.020
It's so peaceful out here.

07:03.254 --> 07:05.155
Yeah, it is, isn't it?

07:05.157 --> 07:08.158
All the noise and
the joy in the church,

07:08.160 --> 07:10.994
and then...

07:10.996 --> 07:14.100
just peace.

07:17.102 --> 07:19.302
Kind of makes me...

07:21.006 --> 07:23.739
Feel like I... I...

07:23.741 --> 07:26.742
I wanna burst.

07:26.744 --> 07:30.713
Well, forgive me, my dear,
but I think you're about to.

07:33.852 --> 07:34.987
Ha ha.

07:50.301 --> 07:54.838
John, you do know you're
driving without your lights on.

07:54.840 --> 07:56.042
I do know.

07:57.742 --> 08:01.046
It seems like it'd be an insult
to all this beautiful moonlight.

08:06.318 --> 08:09.319
Do you have any idea
how many miles

08:09.321 --> 08:12.224
that light has traveled
to shine down on you?

08:13.325 --> 08:15.995
I know. I know.

08:20.032 --> 08:21.233
On us.

08:24.169 --> 08:25.371
Even better.

08:52.931 --> 08:54.997
Good afternoon, Natani,

08:54.999 --> 08:56.201
I see your wife is better.

08:57.369 --> 08:59.069
Yes, there, Minister.

08:59.071 --> 09:01.337
Our prayers have been answered.

09:01.339 --> 09:02.941
Thanks be to God.

09:04.308 --> 09:05.974
And to you.

09:05.976 --> 09:08.011
My faith was in God,

09:08.013 --> 09:09.348
I hope yours was also.

09:10.449 --> 09:14.150
We only knew of God
because of what you taught us.

09:14.152 --> 09:16.254
And I because of
what others had taught me.

09:18.223 --> 09:20.256
We thank you for
listening to them,

09:20.258 --> 09:21.926
so that you could teach us.

09:25.964 --> 09:28.234
There have been others
who have taught us as well.

09:31.168 --> 09:33.969
We've decided
to join with the Mormons.

09:33.971 --> 09:36.939
We have brought you
this month's offering,

09:36.941 --> 09:40.109
some ufi, some talo
and baby pig.

09:42.314 --> 09:44.948
God willing, we'll have
enough to give offerings

09:44.950 --> 09:47.317
to both churches
this coming year.

09:47.319 --> 09:48.988
That will not be necessary.

09:50.855 --> 09:52.021
We are in your debt.

09:52.023 --> 09:53.857
You are in God's debt,

09:53.859 --> 09:55.024
and this is how you repay him,

09:55.026 --> 09:57.863
with this... with this
blasphemy, huh?

09:58.763 --> 10:01.964
We had hoped that you would
give us your blessing.

10:01.966 --> 10:02.967
I cannot do that.

10:05.470 --> 10:07.273
Then we can only give you ours.

10:09.407 --> 10:12.411
Thanks be to God for you,
Reverend Paletu'a.

10:14.012 --> 10:15.881
You brought us to Christ.

10:26.423 --> 10:27.425
Natani!

10:30.361 --> 10:32.964
Do not ever come back.

10:39.037 --> 10:40.239
- Fatai.
- Yes.

10:42.340 --> 10:45.208
Take this food,
burn it in the fire.

10:45.210 --> 10:46.211
Yes, Father.

10:53.450 --> 10:55.287
Throw the pig
in the sea.

10:57.221 --> 10:58.921
But Father...

10:58.923 --> 11:01.059
Throw the pig
in the sea.

12:06.523 --> 12:09.494
So you're telling
me you're at an impasse?

12:09.827 --> 12:12.395
Bishop, I haven't
budged one bit.

12:12.397 --> 12:15.265
Only person at an
impasse here is her.

12:15.267 --> 12:16.399
Get your finger out of my face

12:16.401 --> 12:17.434
or I'll bite it off.

12:17.436 --> 12:20.370
Sister Lawson, please
don't bite your husband.

12:20.372 --> 12:22.107
Sister Lawson.

12:23.240 --> 12:25.141
If he's gonna
treat me like a dog,

12:25.143 --> 12:27.010
I may as well act like one.

12:27.012 --> 12:29.011
Your dog is the problem.

12:29.013 --> 12:31.280
My dog saved your life.

12:31.282 --> 12:34.416
I would have gotten out
of there without its help.

12:34.418 --> 12:37.219
You would have died stuck
on the pot and you know it.

12:37.221 --> 12:40.555
Sister, brother...
Lawson's, please.

12:40.557 --> 12:42.592
You ought to thank
your lucky stars

12:42.594 --> 12:44.260
Bonnie came in
with the newspaper.

12:44.262 --> 12:46.065
Okay, all right, all right.

12:47.499 --> 12:50.565
Uh, Bishop Groberg,
are you okay?

12:50.567 --> 12:55.271
Yes, but...

12:55.273 --> 12:59.041
please tell me how
I'm supposed to feel

12:59.043 --> 13:01.444
when two of my ward's stalwarts

13:01.446 --> 13:04.447
are threatening
divorce over a dog.

13:04.449 --> 13:06.448
Uh, I-I'm sorry, Bishop,

13:06.450 --> 13:08.450
but that dog pees everywhere.

13:08.452 --> 13:10.053
Look who's talking.

13:10.055 --> 13:12.056
A-And... she...

13:14.225 --> 13:16.458
She loves that dog
more than she loves me.

13:16.460 --> 13:19.264
That's because he treats
me better than you do.

13:32.509 --> 13:34.109
Is that true, Verl?

13:34.111 --> 13:35.545
What, that
she loves the dog

13:35.547 --> 13:37.146
more than she loves me?

13:37.148 --> 13:40.248
That the dog treats
her better than you do.

13:40.250 --> 13:42.150
Well, I don't know, Bishop.

13:42.152 --> 13:45.088
I mean, I don't roll
over and play dead

13:45.090 --> 13:47.357
every time she asks,
if that's what you mean.

13:47.359 --> 13:51.194
Yeah, and you don't curl up
and snuggle with me either,

13:51.196 --> 13:52.531
unless you want something.

13:54.566 --> 13:57.199
Well, it sounds to me

13:57.201 --> 14:00.136
like you're both getting
better treatment from the dog

14:00.138 --> 14:01.471
than you are from each other.

14:01.473 --> 14:03.271
No, but that's the
whole point, Bishop,

14:03.273 --> 14:04.540
that's why we gotta
get rid of him.

14:04.542 --> 14:06.108
- Or you.
- Or you.

14:06.110 --> 14:07.543
I said it first.

14:07.545 --> 14:08.547
I rest my case.

14:16.287 --> 14:18.387
I'm hungry, Mommy.

14:18.389 --> 14:19.554
It will be ready soon.

14:19.556 --> 14:21.623
Bang, bang,
you're dead, Lucy girl.

14:21.625 --> 14:23.593
Nancy don't kill
your sister in the kitchen.

14:23.595 --> 14:26.261
You can't kill me,
I just killed you.

14:26.263 --> 14:28.397
Girls, don't talk like that.

14:28.399 --> 14:30.466
We're not talking,
we're yelling!

14:30.468 --> 14:33.602
Kaboom! That's my canon!
Kaboom! Kaboom!

14:35.139 --> 14:37.406
Who put a Q-tip in the yogurt?

14:37.408 --> 14:40.175
I wanna eat, Mom.

14:40.177 --> 14:41.376
- Bang, bang!
- Boom!

14:42.513 --> 14:44.146
Oh, what in
the world, John?

14:44.148 --> 14:46.448
I had another
meeting with the Lawsons.

14:46.450 --> 14:48.617
Uh, no, you... ah.

14:48.619 --> 14:51.587
Can you put that thing
in the garage please?

14:51.589 --> 14:53.155
Good idea.

14:53.157 --> 14:54.723
Okay.

14:56.293 --> 14:57.593
He likes you, Daddy.

14:57.595 --> 14:59.395
Yeah.

14:59.397 --> 15:01.130
Yeah.

15:01.132 --> 15:03.299
Oh, I got a letter
from Salt Lake today,

15:03.301 --> 15:04.699
I think it's a mistake, though,

15:04.701 --> 15:07.306
because it's addressed
to Elder Groberg.

15:08.406 --> 15:09.407
Hmm.

15:10.642 --> 15:14.213
Ah, girls, help... help me clean
this up, will you? Come on.

15:15.513 --> 15:18.747
Put them all
on the side, this one...

15:18.749 --> 15:20.485
Is very heavy.

15:22.653 --> 15:25.657
John, what's wrong?

15:27.492 --> 15:29.527
How soon can you have that baby?

15:33.598 --> 15:36.198
Dear, Brother Groberg,

15:36.200 --> 15:37.732
you are hereby called to serve

15:37.734 --> 15:41.771
as President of the
Tonga Fiji mission.

15:41.773 --> 15:44.607
You will serve for
a period of three years

15:44.609 --> 15:48.477
at the mission headquarters
in Nuku'alofa, Tonga.

15:48.479 --> 15:51.680
You will preside over
200 missionaries

15:51.682 --> 15:55.617
on 40 islands
in three countries,

15:55.619 --> 15:59.222
speaking five languages.

15:59.224 --> 16:02.424
We trust the Lord will
watch over you and your family

16:02.426 --> 16:05.364
as you lose yourself
in His service.

16:10.468 --> 16:13.368
She loves being held by you.

16:13.370 --> 16:16.639
I love her, but when are we
gonna get a boy, Mommy?

16:16.641 --> 16:20.646
Well, whenever Heavenly Father
sends us one, darling.

16:56.446 --> 16:58.747
Where is your father?

16:58.749 --> 17:01.817
Selling kava at the
other end of the market.

17:01.819 --> 17:04.755
I do not think he would approve
of your talking to me.

17:06.357 --> 17:08.527
My father would not
approve of many things.

17:10.794 --> 17:12.329
How is our little pig?

17:13.631 --> 17:15.833
He's not here for sale
if you're looking to buy him.

17:18.703 --> 17:21.837
I am going to make
him big and fat,

17:21.839 --> 17:24.510
and I am going to offer
him to your father again.

17:26.444 --> 17:28.480
I don't think my father
will change his mind.

17:30.715 --> 17:33.715
Then I will own the oldest,

17:33.717 --> 17:35.686
fattest pig in all of Tonga.

17:41.492 --> 17:43.662
Why did you do it, Natani?

17:46.863 --> 17:48.799
Why did you leave
my father's church?

17:50.467 --> 17:52.601
I had questions your
father could not answer.

17:52.603 --> 17:55.740
But you shamed
our family, our village.

17:57.942 --> 18:00.408
I honored your father.

18:00.410 --> 18:02.744
I honored your father by
building upon the truth

18:02.746 --> 18:04.746
that he gave to me.

18:04.748 --> 18:07.718
If he allowed me, I would
tell him all about it.

18:11.421 --> 18:12.490
He would rather die.

18:13.791 --> 18:15.426
He would rather I die.

18:17.895 --> 18:18.897
Perhaps.

18:23.467 --> 18:25.937
I heard my father speaking
with the leaders of the village.

18:27.504 --> 18:30.641
You should move, quickly,
before there is trouble.

18:33.677 --> 18:34.909
But Tofua is my home.

18:34.911 --> 18:36.981
Tofua was your home.

18:38.515 --> 18:40.883
Until you joined
with the Mormons.

18:40.885 --> 18:43.555
I heard my father say it
with my own ears.

18:44.688 --> 18:48.523
There will never
be Mormons in Tofua.

18:48.525 --> 18:49.527
Ever.

18:51.763 --> 18:54.797
Your family is young,
your farm is small.

18:54.799 --> 18:56.501
You can do better elsewhere.

18:57.534 --> 18:59.403
You'll be safer elsewhere.

19:01.938 --> 19:03.407
You will help me?

19:05.409 --> 19:06.811
I will come tomorrow night.

19:07.611 --> 19:09.947
My father sleeps soundly
after eating momo.

19:13.951 --> 19:15.887
Toutai.

19:17.455 --> 19:18.857
Thank you for warning me.

19:19.956 --> 19:21.994
Thank you for taking
care of my pig.

19:35.706 --> 19:37.873
Wow, Daddy,
everybody's brown here.

19:37.875 --> 19:38.874
Yes, they are.

19:38.876 --> 19:41.444
And everything's green.

19:41.446 --> 19:43.044
Everything but the sea.

19:43.046 --> 19:44.914
Is this where I'll shop?

19:44.916 --> 19:46.781
Uh, well,
there's a store in town,

19:46.783 --> 19:48.783
but the freshest
stuff is all here.

19:48.785 --> 19:50.453
Sure is fresh.

20:07.071 --> 20:10.473
- There it is.
- It's our new home.

20:10.475 --> 20:11.776
Isn't it great?

20:15.513 --> 20:18.614
That was a wonderful
dinner, Sister Dalton.

20:18.616 --> 20:20.616
You should thank Siueti.

20:20.618 --> 20:22.952
- Malo aupito, Siueti.
- Yes, thank you.

20:22.954 --> 20:24.919
Thank you
so much, Sister Siueti.

20:24.921 --> 20:26.490
You're welcome, Elder Monson.

20:31.596 --> 20:33.729
Can we be excused now, Mommy?

20:33.731 --> 20:34.864
Um...

20:34.866 --> 20:36.732
Just stay in the courtyard.

20:36.734 --> 20:38.567
Let's go.

20:38.569 --> 20:41.002
Not you, honey, it's bedtime.

20:44.509 --> 20:47.041
Up.
Come on. No, no.

20:47.043 --> 20:49.547
Go with Kesaia, please.

21:01.058 --> 21:05.528
President... Groberg,

21:05.530 --> 21:09.030
Sister Dalton and I were
talking with Elder Monson

21:09.032 --> 21:10.799
before you arrived.

21:10.801 --> 21:12.934
I know you've been a
missionary in Tonga before,

21:12.936 --> 21:14.736
but I'm not sure
you've thought about

21:14.738 --> 21:17.039
how this place
suits your children.

21:17.041 --> 21:20.142
We just worry about
how young your family is.

21:20.144 --> 21:23.148
Ew, Nancy, that's gross.

21:24.148 --> 21:26.749
Well, I'm sure the Lord
will take care of us.

21:26.751 --> 21:29.154
The Lord cares for those
who care for themselves.

21:31.555 --> 21:34.155
Missionaries have
died serving here.

21:34.157 --> 21:37.091
The medical care is primitive.

21:37.093 --> 21:39.861
You should ask to be reassigned.

21:41.565 --> 21:43.701
That's a juicy one!

21:45.636 --> 21:49.137
Uh, President Dalton, I...

21:49.139 --> 21:52.974
we appreciate your concern.

21:52.976 --> 21:54.742
Elder Monson, you were
involved in our call,

21:54.744 --> 21:55.746
what do you think?

21:57.715 --> 21:59.650
I think President
Dalton is right.

22:01.118 --> 22:03.588
And I
think you are right.

22:04.821 --> 22:05.823
I'm sorry?

22:07.625 --> 22:10.859
The Lord could make good
use of you elsewhere,

22:10.861 --> 22:13.863
but I think if you decide to
stay and trust in the Lord,

22:13.865 --> 22:16.632
there will be challenges,

22:16.634 --> 22:18.837
but He will take care of you.

22:23.006 --> 22:25.607
We thank all of you
for your concerns.

22:25.609 --> 22:27.009
Yes.

22:27.011 --> 22:30.613
But we believe the Lord
sent us here for a reason,

22:30.615 --> 22:33.616
and we believe He
will see us through.

22:33.618 --> 22:37.619
Yeah, well, I understand.

22:37.621 --> 22:39.021
But I'm not sure you do.

22:39.023 --> 22:40.759
Yes, President...

22:43.628 --> 22:45.027
I think he does.

22:45.029 --> 22:46.161
But what about...

22:46.163 --> 22:47.796
Why don't we go
back to the hotel

22:47.798 --> 22:50.732
so that John and Jean
can get settled.

22:50.734 --> 22:51.902
Certainly.

22:59.109 --> 23:00.842
You made the right choice.

23:06.884 --> 23:09.251
Squish, squish,
squish, got 'em!

23:09.253 --> 23:10.685
Me too.

23:12.889 --> 23:14.656
We're killing bugs, Mommy.

23:14.658 --> 23:17.659
Yeah, I can see that.

23:17.661 --> 23:18.927
We'll be at the
hotel if you need anything.

23:18.929 --> 23:20.898
Thank you. Have a safe flight.

23:29.940 --> 23:31.740
Let's go, girls.

23:31.742 --> 23:32.744
Get 'em.

23:45.222 --> 23:46.821
Got him!

23:46.823 --> 23:47.822
Big one.

23:47.824 --> 23:49.293
Two one.

25:09.873 --> 25:12.808
Okay, so let me
get this straight,

25:12.810 --> 25:14.242
we have ten districts.

25:14.244 --> 25:15.309
Eleven.

25:15.311 --> 25:19.147
Eleven districts,
uh, 100 branches.

25:19.149 --> 25:20.949
Ninety-eight.

25:20.951 --> 25:22.885
Thank you, Nancy.

25:22.887 --> 25:25.319
Uh, 200 missionaries,

25:25.321 --> 25:27.889
10,000 members on
40 different islands.

25:27.891 --> 25:29.324
In three different countries.

25:29.326 --> 25:31.092
And five languages.

25:31.094 --> 25:34.163
Okay, uh, who handles
the finances?

25:34.165 --> 25:35.399
Um, you do.

25:37.868 --> 25:40.168
Uh, government relations?

25:40.170 --> 25:41.338
Also you.

25:45.009 --> 25:46.344
Chapel construction?

25:51.849 --> 25:54.415
So, tell me,

25:54.417 --> 25:57.254
when am I supposed to
do missionary work?

26:19.209 --> 26:22.846
The cart horse seemed
tired today, huh, Fatai?

26:23.914 --> 26:25.880
Yes, Father, it did.

26:25.882 --> 26:28.349
And then this morning,

26:28.351 --> 26:31.886
Natani and his family are gone.

26:31.888 --> 26:34.021
Like bats in the night,

26:34.023 --> 26:35.193
disappeared.

26:39.230 --> 26:41.329
Coming back from the garden,

26:41.331 --> 26:43.932
I find this on the beach,

26:43.934 --> 26:45.136
full of seaweed.

26:46.369 --> 26:50.407
Did I not ask you to
throw Natani's pig in the sea?

26:51.442 --> 26:53.174
Yes, Father, you did.

26:53.176 --> 26:54.946
And did you do it?

26:56.013 --> 26:57.011
You were very angry.

26:57.013 --> 26:58.349
Did you do what I asked?

27:01.017 --> 27:02.019
No.

27:03.888 --> 27:05.921
I thought you would
regret your decision.

27:05.923 --> 27:07.058
So you defy me?

27:08.091 --> 27:10.994
You taught me to never
waste what God gives us.

27:12.996 --> 27:15.332
This is not from God.
This is from the devil.

27:17.234 --> 27:20.368
No, it's from Natani,

27:20.370 --> 27:22.171
who loves and admires you.

27:22.173 --> 27:23.905
And he has left my church,

27:23.907 --> 27:26.945
and our village with your help.

27:27.779 --> 27:29.944
You taught me to always
serve my brother.

27:29.946 --> 27:32.079
I taught you to
obey your father.

27:32.081 --> 27:34.148
Before those were
always the same.

27:34.150 --> 27:35.983
And why not now, huh?

27:35.985 --> 27:38.188
Because you are not yourself.

27:40.925 --> 27:43.027
Because you are afraid.

27:44.093 --> 27:45.293
Afraid?

27:45.295 --> 27:49.431
- Hmm? What am I...
- Please, please, please.

27:49.433 --> 27:50.435
Please.

27:52.069 --> 27:53.338
Afraid of what?

27:55.438 --> 27:57.207
Of teachings.

27:58.542 --> 28:02.043
Teachings you do not understand.

28:02.045 --> 28:03.280
What are you talking about, huh?

28:05.049 --> 28:06.949
The things that...

28:06.951 --> 28:09.318
the things that Natani
learned from the Mormons,

28:09.320 --> 28:10.953
they make sense to me...

28:10.955 --> 28:12.090
Gah!

28:15.259 --> 28:18.292
Both of you, get out.

28:18.294 --> 28:19.496
Get the shovels.

28:20.563 --> 28:22.100
Get out!

28:32.076 --> 28:33.508
Sione, Sione.

28:33.510 --> 28:34.976
Think about my church.

28:34.978 --> 28:36.310
Please, please. No, don't.

28:36.312 --> 28:37.578
He must learn.

28:37.580 --> 28:38.582
Enough!

28:47.323 --> 28:49.992
And even though
they were sick,

28:49.994 --> 28:53.095
the missionaries stood up
in the back of their wagon

28:53.097 --> 28:55.030
and they raised
their arms in the air,

28:55.032 --> 28:58.200
and they yelled
"Hurrah for Israel!"

28:58.202 --> 29:00.202
- Hurrah for Israel!
- Hurrah for Israel!

29:00.204 --> 29:01.936
Yeah, that's right.

29:01.938 --> 29:04.274
And they all lived
happily ever after.

29:07.043 --> 29:08.045
Good night, girls.

29:16.352 --> 29:17.388
Daddy?

29:18.355 --> 29:19.457
Yes, Nancy.

29:20.590 --> 29:23.591
How come do all your stories
end happily ever after?

29:23.593 --> 29:25.529
That's because I'm
telling them to you.

29:26.796 --> 29:30.467
No, really, even your
sad stories seem to end happy.

29:32.069 --> 29:34.202
Well, if you're good,

29:34.204 --> 29:36.070
and you wait long enough,

29:36.072 --> 29:38.373
all your stories
will end happily.

29:38.375 --> 29:41.209
I lost all my friends in
Idaho when we moved here,

29:41.211 --> 29:43.181
what's happy about that?

29:43.981 --> 29:47.316
In three years, you're
gonna go back to Idaho

29:47.318 --> 29:50.585
and you will be
happy to see them.

29:50.587 --> 29:53.555
My cousin Levi died,

29:53.557 --> 29:55.660
what's happy about that?

30:04.635 --> 30:07.168
When you die,

30:07.170 --> 30:09.503
you will be with Levi in heaven.

30:09.505 --> 30:10.638
Honest?

30:10.640 --> 30:11.676
Honest.

30:13.609 --> 30:16.481
Sometimes I get scared
and lonely here.

30:19.382 --> 30:22.085
Sometimes I do too.

30:23.353 --> 30:25.355
What do you do when
you feel that way?

30:26.189 --> 30:29.191
I tell stories with happy
endings to my daughters.

30:32.495 --> 30:34.495
Daddy?

30:34.497 --> 30:36.231
Yes, Nancy.

30:36.233 --> 30:39.100
If I die before you,

30:39.102 --> 30:41.136
wherever I go,

30:41.138 --> 30:43.107
I will wait for you there.

30:44.241 --> 30:46.107
Thank you, honey.

30:46.109 --> 30:48.510
I will...

30:48.512 --> 30:50.281
I will wait for you too.

31:09.132 --> 31:10.133
Enough.

31:12.436 --> 31:13.437
Get up.

31:15.371 --> 31:17.542
You, get in.

31:18.675 --> 31:20.278
Get in the hole.

31:23.679 --> 31:24.681
Get in.

31:34.425 --> 31:36.694
You will spend the night here
and have a good think.

31:39.295 --> 31:40.494
We shall see how you feel

31:40.496 --> 31:41.629
about these Mormons
in the morning, huh.

31:41.631 --> 31:42.632
Fatai!

31:54.177 --> 31:56.179
I will come back for
you in the morning.

31:56.746 --> 32:00.182
Yes, my father.

32:00.184 --> 32:03.717
Spend this time
with yourself, huh.

32:03.719 --> 32:05.222
Have a good think.

32:08.524 --> 32:10.628
Fatai, come.

32:28.544 --> 32:29.610
What was that?

32:29.612 --> 32:31.213
Oh, it's just coconuts

32:31.215 --> 32:32.817
being blown out
of the tree, honey.

32:42.626 --> 32:43.761
John!

32:44.360 --> 32:46.794
My eyes,
Daddy, my eyes!

32:46.796 --> 32:48.663
Oh be careful, Jean.

32:48.665 --> 32:50.298
Okay, sweetie, yeah,
keep your eyes closed.

32:50.300 --> 32:51.165
Shh. That's it.

32:51.167 --> 32:52.267
Hey, keep your eyes
closed, sweetie.

32:52.269 --> 32:54.269
- I've got glass in my eyes.
- That's okay. Come on.

32:54.271 --> 32:56.240
Come on, everything's okay.
Everything's fine.

32:56.673 --> 32:57.742
Okay. Ow!

32:59.243 --> 33:00.308
Okay, come on, come on.

33:00.310 --> 33:01.646
- My eyes.
- It's okay.

33:05.515 --> 33:06.450
Oh, God.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.289
Dear, God.

33:16.392 --> 33:21.296
Please have mercy!
Give me strength!

33:21.298 --> 33:22.797
Ahh!

33:22.799 --> 33:26.471
God! Oh, dear God!

33:35.646 --> 33:37.546
Your brother,
he'll die.

33:37.548 --> 33:39.417
Fatai, come!

33:56.532 --> 33:57.635
Get the gate.

34:10.447 --> 34:11.846
Father.

34:11.848 --> 34:13.417
Let me help you.

34:14.650 --> 34:17.487
Fatai, go get your brother.

34:19.922 --> 34:21.359
Ahh!

34:22.759 --> 34:26.393
Fatai!

34:31.567 --> 34:33.638
Fatai. Fatai!

34:44.681 --> 34:49.520
Fatai!

35:06.603 --> 35:08.806
Natani! Natani, come quick.

35:13.643 --> 35:16.479
Toutai, my brother,
what happened to you?

36:14.571 --> 36:17.040
Peace,
I leave with you.

36:19.710 --> 36:22.580
My peace I give unto you.

36:25.681 --> 36:28.585
Not as the world giveth...

36:30.721 --> 36:33.922
Give I unto you.

36:36.659 --> 36:39.994
Do not let your
heart be troubled.

36:42.998 --> 36:45.669
Neither let it be afraid.

38:14.023 --> 38:15.690
Toutai?

38:15.692 --> 38:16.793
You are awake.

38:24.067 --> 38:25.770
I'm so happy to see you.

38:27.036 --> 38:30.038
Why did you come?
What are you doing here?

38:30.040 --> 38:31.108
I need...

38:33.576 --> 38:36.980
I want you to baptize me.

38:39.583 --> 38:41.081
Okay, Toutai,

38:41.083 --> 38:42.750
I will baptize you tomorrow

38:42.752 --> 38:44.886
but you need to go back to bed.

38:44.888 --> 38:46.887
- No.
- You need to rest.

38:46.889 --> 38:48.658
I need...

38:49.993 --> 38:52.929
I want to be baptized now.

38:54.831 --> 38:56.200
You have the authority.

38:58.668 --> 39:00.634
Toutai,

39:00.636 --> 39:02.871
it is the middle of the night.

39:02.873 --> 39:04.742
I will baptize you
in the morning.

39:06.141 --> 39:10.844
If I die before morning,

39:10.846 --> 39:14.051
I want to die baptized.

39:15.851 --> 39:17.886
You are sure?

39:17.888 --> 39:18.989
I am sure.

39:21.023 --> 39:24.929
Okay, I will baptize you.

39:47.250 --> 39:50.851
Tonga Toutai Paletu'a.

39:50.853 --> 39:54.058
Yes, that is me, Lord.

39:54.991 --> 39:57.824
Having been commissioned
of Jesus Christ.

39:57.826 --> 39:59.929
I love Jesus Christ.

40:00.797 --> 40:03.197
I baptize you in
the name of the Father.

40:03.199 --> 40:05.233
I love the Father.

40:05.235 --> 40:06.800
And of the Son.

40:06.802 --> 40:08.670
I love the Son.

40:08.672 --> 40:10.672
And of the Holy Ghost.

40:10.674 --> 40:13.808
I feel the Holy Ghost.

40:13.810 --> 40:16.279
- Amen.
- Amen.

40:19.683 --> 40:21.752
I have to put you
under the water now.

40:23.987 --> 40:25.820
I know.

40:25.822 --> 40:27.291
It will probably hurt a lot.

40:29.926 --> 40:31.228
I know that too.

40:49.913 --> 40:50.947
Toutai?

40:53.782 --> 40:55.782
Toutai, my friend.

40:55.784 --> 40:57.120
Where have you gone?

40:59.022 --> 41:00.755
When you wake up,

41:00.757 --> 41:03.027
we are going to
have a long talk.

41:08.331 --> 41:10.163
My doll's a pretty one.

41:10.165 --> 41:12.132
My doll's prettier.

41:12.134 --> 41:14.268
Oh, girls, don't fight.

41:14.270 --> 41:15.737
We're not.

41:15.739 --> 41:16.904
We are too.

41:16.906 --> 41:18.739
Jean? Jean, we got it!

41:18.741 --> 41:19.675
Got what?

41:19.677 --> 41:22.210
Approval to build
a chapel in Niuatoputapu.

41:22.212 --> 41:23.878
In new what?

41:23.880 --> 41:25.279
I just got word
from Elder Monson,

41:25.281 --> 41:26.913
he's going to come visit us.

41:26.915 --> 41:29.116
Oh, that's wonderful, John.

41:29.118 --> 41:30.284
How do you
spell that island?

41:30.286 --> 41:32.920
It doesn't matter,
I'm taking you there.

41:32.922 --> 41:34.288
What?

41:34.290 --> 41:35.757
When?

41:35.759 --> 41:36.991
Tomorrow morning.

41:36.993 --> 41:38.826
I can't wait for you
to see it, Jean.

41:38.828 --> 41:40.360
This is the place
where it all happened.

41:40.362 --> 41:42.866
I know, I remember.

41:44.366 --> 41:46.035
I remember.

41:48.203 --> 41:50.139
Careful on
the dock, girls.

41:51.107 --> 41:54.208
It's so strange not having
Marilyn and Jane with us.

41:54.210 --> 41:56.878
Oh, I know, but Siueti
will take good care of them.

41:56.880 --> 41:58.980
So how long does
it take to get there?

41:58.982 --> 42:00.150
Uh, five days.

42:01.016 --> 42:03.050
Give or take.
We have to tow that barge.

42:03.052 --> 42:04.284
It depends on the weather.

42:04.286 --> 42:05.786
Oh, watch your step.

42:05.788 --> 42:06.924
Careful, girls.

42:08.190 --> 42:09.859
Josiah, be
careful with them.

42:11.895 --> 42:13.326
This dock is
not in great shape.

42:13.328 --> 42:14.330
There's a hole right there.

42:16.299 --> 42:17.831
Daddy, what's that?

42:17.833 --> 42:19.800
You'll see.

42:19.802 --> 42:21.201
Isn't he cute?

42:21.203 --> 42:23.072
You like it? Oh.

42:40.857 --> 42:43.056
Be careful, she might bite you.

42:43.058 --> 42:45.361
She doesn't have teeth yet. Ow!

42:46.429 --> 42:47.965
She does.

43:02.911 --> 43:04.447
It's a miracle, you know.

43:06.850 --> 43:08.118
What is a miracle, Kolipoki?

43:09.018 --> 43:11.889
That there's going to be
a chapel on Niuatoputapu.

43:13.288 --> 43:15.088
You're right,

43:15.090 --> 43:16.858
it is a miracle.

43:16.860 --> 43:17.861
Yes, it is.

43:21.130 --> 43:23.998
It is also a miracle that

43:24.000 --> 43:26.099
we are here on this
boat together, eh.

43:26.101 --> 43:28.001
Why is that?

43:28.003 --> 43:29.339
Because we are old friends.

43:31.406 --> 43:33.342
Well, why don't I
recognize you, then?

43:34.978 --> 43:36.213
Because I'm all grown up.

43:42.418 --> 43:46.154
When I was little,
I fell from a mango tree

43:46.156 --> 43:48.192
and hit my head on the roots.

43:50.159 --> 43:51.893
I was dead through the night

43:51.895 --> 43:55.099
but your prayers
brought me back.

43:56.098 --> 43:57.998
Nuku.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.266
- You're Nuku?
- Yeah.

43:59.268 --> 44:01.168
What? Come here.

44:01.170 --> 44:02.869
Why didn't you tell me?

44:02.871 --> 44:04.505
You didn't ask.

44:04.507 --> 44:07.308
It is such a blessing
to see you.

44:07.310 --> 44:09.277
What are you doing here?

44:09.279 --> 44:11.112
I am working to save
money for my mission.

44:11.114 --> 44:12.913
Ah, of course you are.

44:12.915 --> 44:14.984
Hey, come with me.
I want you to meet my family.

44:17.052 --> 44:19.052
Girls, there's
someone I want you to meet.

44:19.054 --> 44:20.253
This is Nuku.

44:20.255 --> 44:22.190
Nu who?

44:22.192 --> 44:23.357
You remember the boy
on my mission

44:23.359 --> 44:25.061
that God brought
back from the dead?

44:26.061 --> 44:27.061
Is it true?

44:27.063 --> 44:28.262
Are you really him?

44:28.264 --> 44:30.197
Yes, I am Nuku.

44:30.199 --> 44:32.335
I've always wanted
to meet a miracle.

44:34.036 --> 44:35.369
Me too.

44:35.371 --> 44:37.003
Jean!

44:37.005 --> 44:39.273
Jean, come here, there's
someone I want you to meet.

44:39.275 --> 44:41.478
This is Nuku, the boy who
fell from the mango tree.

44:43.212 --> 44:46.279
How wonderful
to meet you.

44:46.281 --> 44:48.315
Uh, I should go back
to my post now.

44:48.317 --> 44:49.416
Ah.

44:49.418 --> 44:50.351
I have to keep watch
on the barge.

44:50.353 --> 44:52.119
Can we go with him, Daddy?

44:52.121 --> 44:53.554
Please?

44:53.556 --> 44:56.224
All right, just for a little
while, but do what he says,

44:56.226 --> 44:58.025
and stay away from
the edge of the boat.

44:58.027 --> 44:59.025
- I will.
- Okay.

44:59.027 --> 45:00.029
We will.

45:03.165 --> 45:05.201
Not you, you're too small.

46:52.342 --> 46:54.474
What are they doing, Daddy?

46:54.476 --> 46:56.610
They have to take
turns on the barge.

46:56.612 --> 46:58.148
Here we go.

46:59.415 --> 47:01.150
Nuku, you can't go.

47:02.518 --> 47:03.650
Why not?

47:03.652 --> 47:06.487
Because you are our miracle.

47:08.090 --> 47:10.358
Well, then,

47:10.360 --> 47:12.360
why don't you come with me?

47:12.362 --> 47:13.494
Can I, Daddy?

47:13.496 --> 47:15.096
Can we?

47:15.098 --> 47:17.364
Uh...

47:17.366 --> 47:21.101
Just Nancy, and just
for a little bit.

47:21.103 --> 47:22.703
- Yippee!
- Wah.

47:22.705 --> 47:24.505
Come on.

47:24.507 --> 47:27.375
Wait a minute,
we forgot Abigail.

47:27.377 --> 47:28.409
Who?

47:28.411 --> 47:30.444
Our goat.

47:30.446 --> 47:33.549
The goat. Okay, hold on. Oh.

47:45.395 --> 47:47.261
Ready?

47:47.263 --> 47:49.598
Come on, let's go.

47:50.665 --> 47:52.266
Be careful, Nancy.

47:52.268 --> 47:55.136
- I will, Mom.
- I wanted to go.

47:55.138 --> 47:57.505
Well, when you're older, okay?

47:57.507 --> 47:59.273
Promise.

47:59.275 --> 48:00.377
Oh.

48:08.518 --> 48:12.222
Kolipoki, Kolipoki,
come quickly.

48:13.288 --> 48:14.288
Come.

48:14.290 --> 48:15.292
Look.

48:25.668 --> 48:27.735
Reel 'em in. Reel 'em in!

48:27.737 --> 48:29.369
It's too heavy in the waves.

48:29.371 --> 48:30.337
Well, cut the engine!

48:30.339 --> 48:31.607
We'll lose control.

48:33.676 --> 48:35.308
Come on!

48:35.310 --> 48:36.312
Turn.

48:40.583 --> 48:41.718
No, don't grab it.

48:45.554 --> 48:47.790
No, no, no, no, no, no!

48:52.194 --> 48:53.796
The boat, to the boat.

48:59.601 --> 49:01.469
- Come on.
- Nancy!

49:01.471 --> 49:03.173
Daddy!

49:04.473 --> 49:05.775
Ah, it's stuck!

49:21.556 --> 49:22.591
Help!

49:25.360 --> 49:26.529
Take my hand!

49:27.830 --> 49:29.366
Nuku.

49:29.799 --> 49:31.831
John, do something!

49:31.833 --> 49:33.833
Jean, get back inside.

49:33.835 --> 49:36.237
- You have to save her!
- Get back inside!

49:36.239 --> 49:37.507
I got you.

49:39.741 --> 49:40.776
Jean!

49:44.413 --> 49:47.380
Go back inside
with the children.

49:47.382 --> 49:51.518
Kolipoki, Kolipoki,
you have to cut the rope.

49:51.520 --> 49:53.389
The barge will sink.

49:54.589 --> 49:57.291
Do it now, or we will all die.

49:57.293 --> 49:58.295
All right.

50:16.511 --> 50:17.878
Do it!

50:17.880 --> 50:20.282
Daddy!

50:29.424 --> 50:30.726
Why?

50:38.900 --> 50:40.603
Please.

50:45.875 --> 50:47.310
Please!

50:48.643 --> 50:49.812
Not my child.

50:52.848 --> 50:55.918
Don't take my girl.

51:02.757 --> 51:04.627
Please...

51:21.543 --> 51:22.811
We're okay, Daddy.

51:23.878 --> 51:25.645
Jean, they're all right.

51:25.647 --> 51:27.716
We're alive.

51:32.621 --> 51:34.491
Hurrah for Israel!

51:35.657 --> 51:39.360
- Hurrah for Israel!
- Hurrah for Israel!

51:39.362 --> 51:41.630
- Hurrah!
- Hurrah!

51:52.808 --> 51:54.507
It's gone.

51:54.509 --> 51:55.645
In the storm.

51:57.947 --> 51:59.616
What do we do?

52:06.755 --> 52:08.621
John, what
are we doing here?

52:08.623 --> 52:09.826
This is where we get off.

52:10.860 --> 52:12.393
How?

52:12.395 --> 52:13.559
You'll see.

52:13.561 --> 52:14.828
No, John.
John, what is this?

52:14.830 --> 52:16.529
This is our only choice.

52:16.531 --> 52:18.866
No, it's not.
We can turn around and go back.

52:18.868 --> 52:20.402
Go ahead, Nancy.

52:25.808 --> 52:26.909
Go ahead.

52:34.482 --> 52:35.482
This is going
to be the hard part.

52:35.484 --> 52:36.750
No, no, no, no, no.

52:36.752 --> 52:38.418
- That's it, that's it.
- No, no, no.

52:38.420 --> 52:39.820
- Okay. Jean, it's okay.
- No, John.

52:39.822 --> 52:41.625
It's okay, it's okay.

52:42.558 --> 52:43.757
No. Ah!

52:47.797 --> 52:48.999
Feki?

52:50.465 --> 52:52.565
Feki Po'uha.

52:52.567 --> 52:54.701
Okay, just get me up there.

52:54.703 --> 52:56.538
Okay, okay.

53:13.822 --> 53:15.922
Welcome back, Kolipoki.

53:15.924 --> 53:17.860
Malo e lei lei.

53:20.529 --> 53:21.563
It's good to be back.

53:22.531 --> 53:23.900
It's good to have you.

53:25.701 --> 53:27.000
And my son with you.

53:27.002 --> 53:28.869
He didn't remember me.

53:28.871 --> 53:30.704
Well, he's all grown up.

53:31.706 --> 53:34.643
Yes, Kolipoki. Please.

53:39.781 --> 53:41.648
Good to see you, Kolipoki.

53:41.650 --> 53:44.016
Yes, very good to see you.

53:44.018 --> 53:45.020
Oh.

53:46.589 --> 53:48.725
I can't believe
you still have these.

53:50.025 --> 53:52.893
Thank you for our
family, Kolipoki.

53:52.895 --> 53:55.764
Well,
you're very welcome.

53:57.500 --> 53:59.500
And you,

53:59.502 --> 54:02.770
really are as beautiful
as he said you were.

54:02.772 --> 54:03.806
So are you.

54:09.811 --> 54:10.911
Ah.

54:10.913 --> 54:15.681
They are
beautiful, Kolipoki!

54:15.683 --> 54:17.050
Asi.

54:17.052 --> 54:18.985
Your feet are fine.

54:18.987 --> 54:22.558
Yes, they're fine, they're fine.

54:33.002 --> 54:34.134
It's been a long time, Kolipoki.

54:34.136 --> 54:35.638
It's been a long time.

54:36.806 --> 54:39.005
This is my family.
My wife, Ole.

54:39.007 --> 54:42.009
Ole, this is my wife, Jean.

54:42.011 --> 54:43.811
Feki, what are you doing here?

54:43.813 --> 54:45.779
I will build your
chapels, Kolipoki,

54:45.781 --> 54:47.683
and you will fill them.

54:53.022 --> 54:54.724
Abigail.

54:55.958 --> 54:58.058
- Abigail.
- She's alive.

54:59.962 --> 55:01.965
- Wait up, Abigail.
- Abigail!

55:03.598 --> 55:04.833
Come on.

57:02.951 --> 57:04.152
True love.

57:06.822 --> 57:07.857
Yes.

58:14.922 --> 58:16.258
Jean, are you okay?

58:17.793 --> 58:18.795
Honey, are you all right?

58:20.763 --> 58:22.230
You've never been
seasick before.

58:25.967 --> 58:28.971
I don't think that
seasickness is the problem.

58:41.984 --> 58:45.788
I want you to know
that even when it's hard...

58:47.221 --> 58:49.822
Especially when it's hard,

58:49.824 --> 58:53.259
I know we are about God's work.

58:53.261 --> 58:57.833
I will be praying for your
success and happiness.

58:59.201 --> 59:04.103
In the name of
Jesus Christ, Amen.

59:04.105 --> 59:05.374
Amen.

59:14.315 --> 59:16.084
Thank you, Sister Groberg.

59:18.152 --> 59:21.087
All right, Elders and Sisters,

59:21.089 --> 59:23.190
I will now announce
missionary assignments

59:23.192 --> 59:24.360
for our new missionaries.

59:25.427 --> 59:27.163
Elder Mapa?

59:28.163 --> 59:29.228
Here, Kolipoki.

59:29.230 --> 59:31.299
You'll be training
Elder Wolfgramm in Nomuka.

59:32.967 --> 59:34.266
Thank you, President.

59:34.268 --> 59:36.069
You're welcome.

59:36.071 --> 59:39.038
Sisters Mataele and Niu?

59:39.040 --> 59:41.376
You will be serving together
in the Liahona District.

59:48.449 --> 59:50.118
Elder Paletu'a?

59:52.453 --> 59:57.157
You will be serving with
Elder Latu in Niuatoputapu.

59:57.159 --> 59:58.858
Welcome,

59:58.860 --> 59:59.996
Elder Paletu'a.

01:00:01.429 --> 01:00:03.929
Elders,

01:00:03.931 --> 01:00:04.966
that is my island.

01:00:06.201 --> 01:00:07.403
We know, Kolipoki.

01:00:08.904 --> 01:00:10.302
Thank you for sending us there.

01:00:10.304 --> 01:00:12.371
Give them all my love.

01:00:12.373 --> 01:00:13.375
We will.

01:00:34.295 --> 01:00:36.098
Foggy day, no?

01:00:37.431 --> 01:00:40.032
Yes, Reverend Sione.

01:00:40.034 --> 01:00:41.036
Very foggy.

01:00:42.304 --> 01:00:43.306
Good for planting.

01:00:44.438 --> 01:00:45.907
And fishing.

01:00:47.976 --> 01:00:49.045
This is true.

01:00:55.083 --> 01:00:57.220
You look tired, Reverend Sione.

01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:00.990
In one year, I have
lost both my sons.

01:01:02.523 --> 01:01:04.123
One of
them still lives.

01:01:04.125 --> 01:01:05.427
Both of them are dead to me.

01:01:08.263 --> 01:01:10.362
I have felt your pain

01:01:10.364 --> 01:01:12.200
and I have prayed for you.

01:01:14.368 --> 01:01:17.105
Thank you for your prayers.

01:01:19.308 --> 01:01:21.043
Tell me, Natani...

01:01:22.476 --> 01:01:25.080
Where is my dead Mormon son?

01:01:28.183 --> 01:01:29.485
He is a preacher.

01:01:32.054 --> 01:01:35.087
Toutai, a preacher?

01:01:35.089 --> 01:01:36.324
Like you.

01:01:39.994 --> 01:01:42.094
Where? Where does he preach?

01:01:42.096 --> 01:01:44.230
I do not know.

01:01:44.232 --> 01:01:46.101
You would have to
ask the Kolipoki.

01:01:47.435 --> 01:01:49.969
The... the Kolipoki?

01:01:49.971 --> 01:01:52.105
The palangi president.

01:01:52.107 --> 01:01:53.576
His office is down that road.

01:01:55.043 --> 01:01:57.244
He can tell you
where he sent your son.

01:01:59.982 --> 01:02:02.215
I have to ask the
palangi president

01:02:02.217 --> 01:02:03.352
where he buried my boy?

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:13.395
Sione Paletu'a.

01:02:17.299 --> 01:02:19.134
The Kolipoki is a good man.

01:02:20.534 --> 01:02:21.536
Like you.

01:02:23.538 --> 01:02:25.107
We shall see.

01:02:43.292 --> 01:02:45.328
Yes, come in.

01:02:48.029 --> 01:02:49.496
There's someone
here to see you.

01:02:49.498 --> 01:02:51.130
Well, who is it?

01:02:51.132 --> 01:02:53.199
He says he's the father
of Elder Paletu'a.

01:02:53.201 --> 01:02:54.436
Well, please send him in.

01:03:00.042 --> 01:03:01.474
Brother Paletu'a,

01:03:01.476 --> 01:03:03.412
John Groberg,
pleased to meet you.

01:03:04.545 --> 01:03:06.047
I am not your brother.

01:03:07.248 --> 01:03:09.581
Well, um,

01:03:09.583 --> 01:03:13.054
please have a seat,
let's talk about it.

01:03:16.058 --> 01:03:18.324
Bro... Mr. Paletu'a.

01:03:18.326 --> 01:03:20.192
Reverend Paletu'a.

01:03:20.194 --> 01:03:21.229
Reverend.

01:03:22.397 --> 01:03:24.331
I have many friends
in Tonga who are ministers,

01:03:24.333 --> 01:03:26.435
they're some of the
best people that I know.

01:03:27.268 --> 01:03:31.503
I am the minister from
the village of Tofua.

01:03:31.505 --> 01:03:34.609
You stole my son and
turned him into a Mormon.

01:03:36.110 --> 01:03:37.344
You're not a
member of our church.

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:40.116
I-I did not know that.

01:03:41.616 --> 01:03:43.686
You didn't approve of
your son's baptism?

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:46.656
I did not
know that either.

01:03:49.491 --> 01:03:50.623
Where is he?

01:03:50.625 --> 01:03:52.224
Your son?

01:03:52.226 --> 01:03:53.326
He is no longer my son.

01:03:53.328 --> 01:03:54.626
Your...

01:03:54.628 --> 01:03:57.433
Elder Paletu'a is
in Niuatoputapu.

01:03:59.333 --> 01:04:00.333
Samoa?

01:04:00.335 --> 01:04:02.534
Yes, almost.

01:04:02.536 --> 01:04:05.273
Why did you send him
all the way there?

01:04:07.241 --> 01:04:09.342
It's a beautiful island.

01:04:09.344 --> 01:04:13.382
Your son is working hard.
He is a very good missionary.

01:04:15.250 --> 01:04:17.349
A Mormon missionary?

01:04:17.351 --> 01:04:18.353
Yes.

01:04:20.188 --> 01:04:21.657
Then he is dead to me.

01:04:24.259 --> 01:04:26.226
I'm very sorry to hear
that you feel that way.

01:04:26.228 --> 01:04:27.293
Is there anything that I can do?

01:04:27.295 --> 01:04:30.332
No, no, there is
nothing you can do or say.

01:04:33.301 --> 01:04:35.467
Except,

01:04:35.469 --> 01:04:37.302
please tell my son...

01:04:37.304 --> 01:04:39.304
Yes?

01:04:39.306 --> 01:04:42.410
You tell him to never come back.

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:00.559
Hi.

01:05:00.561 --> 01:05:02.395
Hi.

01:05:02.397 --> 01:05:04.264
What are you reading?

01:05:04.266 --> 01:05:06.534
A poem by Matthew Arnold.

01:05:07.668 --> 01:05:08.668
Really?

01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:11.503
It's about a husband and a wife

01:05:11.505 --> 01:05:13.739
who live in a
cottage by the sea,

01:05:13.741 --> 01:05:15.574
just like us,

01:05:15.576 --> 01:05:19.378
and it's night

01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:22.382
and they hear the sound
of the tide going out...

01:05:24.618 --> 01:05:26.187
Like that.

01:05:27.022 --> 01:05:29.322
And it makes
them think of

01:05:29.324 --> 01:05:31.260
the loss of faith
in the world.

01:05:33.194 --> 01:05:34.462
Yeah.

01:05:35.429 --> 01:05:36.498
Will you read it to me?

01:05:39.234 --> 01:05:43.203
"The sea of faith was
once too at the full

01:05:43.205 --> 01:05:46.605
"and the round Earth's
shore lay like the folds

01:05:46.607 --> 01:05:49.342
"of a bright girdle furled.

01:05:49.344 --> 01:05:53.346
"But now I only hear
its long melancholy

01:05:53.348 --> 01:05:54.784
withdrawing roar."

01:05:59.221 --> 01:06:04.724
"Our love, let us be
true to one another,

01:06:04.726 --> 01:06:07.527
"for the world which
seems to lie before us

01:06:07.529 --> 01:06:09.429
"like a land of dreams

01:06:09.431 --> 01:06:11.498
"hath really neither joy

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:15.268
"nor love, nor light,
nor certitude,

01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:18.837
"nor peace, nor help for pain.

01:06:18.839 --> 01:06:21.674
"And we are here,
as on a darkling plain

01:06:21.676 --> 01:06:25.645
"swept with confused alarms
of struggle and flight,

01:06:25.647 --> 01:06:28.650
"where ignorant armies
clash by night."

01:06:31.485 --> 01:06:32.654
Ignorant armies?

01:06:34.355 --> 01:06:36.322
Hmm.

01:06:36.324 --> 01:06:37.460
Sea of faith.

01:06:39.493 --> 01:06:40.759
Be true to one another.

01:06:40.761 --> 01:06:41.763
Yes.

01:06:45.766 --> 01:06:48.800
Sort of hard to do, though,
you're never here.

01:06:48.802 --> 01:06:52.771
You're always in Fiji,
or some other far-flung island.

01:06:52.773 --> 01:06:55.407
Well, you are right.

01:06:55.409 --> 01:06:58.413
But I am here now.

01:06:59.447 --> 01:07:00.549
So...

01:07:03.284 --> 01:07:04.349
Take a good look.

01:07:18.866 --> 01:07:21.300
Jean,

01:07:21.302 --> 01:07:23.436
do you know why I know
the Gospel's true

01:07:23.438 --> 01:07:24.840
at this very moment?

01:07:26.674 --> 01:07:30.710
Tell me, John,
why is the Gospel true?

01:07:30.712 --> 01:07:35.317
Because, other than
preaching that Gospel...

01:07:36.750 --> 01:07:38.851
I can't think of anything
that could keep me

01:07:38.853 --> 01:07:41.654
from spending every
minute of every day

01:07:41.656 --> 01:07:43.625
right here with you.

01:07:52.567 --> 01:07:54.866
How about a son?

01:07:54.868 --> 01:07:56.337
Mm.

01:07:57.906 --> 01:07:59.340
What?

01:08:00.741 --> 01:08:03.875
Queen Mata'aho had me
over to the palace.

01:08:03.877 --> 01:08:06.378
She said she'd been praying,

01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:08.547
and she believed that
one of the reasons

01:08:08.549 --> 01:08:11.817
God brought us
all the way to Tonga,

01:08:11.819 --> 01:08:13.855
was so we could
have a Tongan son.

01:08:15.757 --> 01:08:17.759
You think we're having a boy?

01:08:19.694 --> 01:08:22.595
I think the queen is gonna
be really mad if we don't.

01:08:24.499 --> 01:08:28.536
Well, that
would be fantastic.

01:08:31.673 --> 01:08:33.375
Absolutely fantastic.

01:08:40.913 --> 01:08:44.649
Many of you
have asked me what to do

01:08:44.652 --> 01:08:48.386
when the Mormon missionaries
come to your houses

01:08:48.389 --> 01:08:49.924
and ask to teach you.

01:08:52.593 --> 01:08:57.430
Some of you wonder
if my mind has changed

01:08:57.432 --> 01:09:00.402
now that my son is one of them.

01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:03.670
I say to you now,

01:09:03.671 --> 01:09:05.540
as I said to you before...

01:09:07.542 --> 01:09:08.676
Ignore them.

01:09:10.911 --> 01:09:13.444
Do not speak to them,

01:09:13.447 --> 01:09:16.685
smile at them,
or let them teach you.

01:09:18.553 --> 01:09:21.586
Do not offer to sing
in their choir.

01:09:21.587 --> 01:09:24.559
Do not send your
children to their schools.

01:09:26.428 --> 01:09:28.661
Let them be dead to you

01:09:28.662 --> 01:09:31.734
as my son is dead to me.

01:09:33.468 --> 01:09:36.033
There will never be Mormons

01:09:36.036 --> 01:09:39.441
in Tofua as long as I live.

01:09:45.645 --> 01:09:46.648
Let us pray.

01:09:48.883 --> 01:09:50.618
I think it's coming.

01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:59.625
Here you go. That's it.

01:09:59.627 --> 01:10:01.463
Mommy.

01:10:01.995 --> 01:10:03.528
It's all right, Liz,

01:10:03.530 --> 01:10:05.864
just go home and go to sleep.

01:10:05.866 --> 01:10:06.998
I'll put them to bed.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.003
Okay, thank you.

01:10:11.606 --> 01:10:12.872
Nurse!

01:10:12.874 --> 01:10:13.805
Nurse!

01:10:13.807 --> 01:10:15.742
Sini, what are you doing?

01:10:15.744 --> 01:10:16.743
I'm having a baby.

01:10:16.745 --> 01:10:18.043
Do you think you could go get...

01:10:18.045 --> 01:10:20.011
- I'll go get Dr. Tapa.
- Thank you.

01:10:20.013 --> 01:10:21.848
You just hold on
until she gets back.

01:10:21.850 --> 01:10:23.750
Okay, I'll see
what I can do.

01:10:23.752 --> 01:10:25.851
Almost there.

01:10:25.853 --> 01:10:27.886
What in the world
could be taking them so long?

01:10:27.888 --> 01:10:29.756
It's a long run to Otuhaka.

01:10:29.758 --> 01:10:32.492
She's running all
the way to Otuhaka?

01:10:32.494 --> 01:10:34.793
By now I hope
she's running back.

01:10:36.097 --> 01:10:37.997
It's okay, honey,
it's gonna be fine.

01:10:37.999 --> 01:10:39.532
- Easy for you to say.
- Sorry.

01:10:39.534 --> 01:10:41.868
Okay, Sini, you can't stop them,

01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:43.769
but you don't have to help them.

01:10:43.771 --> 01:10:45.070
Try very hard to relax.

01:10:45.072 --> 01:10:47.038
I am trying.

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:48.940
I'm gonna go get the car.

01:10:48.942 --> 01:10:50.943
I wouldn't do that, Kolipoki.

01:10:50.945 --> 01:10:52.778
They're probably almost here.

01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:54.613
Ah.

01:10:54.615 --> 01:10:56.549
Sorry, Kolipoki.

01:10:56.551 --> 01:10:58.721
It's all right, I'm okay.

01:11:06.527 --> 01:11:07.659
Baby is coming.

01:11:07.661 --> 01:11:09.828
Where's John? Where's...

01:11:15.136 --> 01:11:17.537
Sini must be calm.

01:11:17.539 --> 01:11:19.070
I can't... I can't wait.

01:11:19.072 --> 01:11:20.672
I can't stop it.

01:11:20.674 --> 01:11:23.078
Slow down, Sini. Relax.

01:11:24.945 --> 01:11:26.912
The baby is coming.

01:11:30.552 --> 01:11:31.818
The baby is coming.

01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:34.554
The baby is coming!

01:11:34.556 --> 01:11:38.090
- Oh, no! Oh.
- Here it comes!

01:11:46.167 --> 01:11:48.835
It's a boy, Sini!

01:11:48.837 --> 01:11:49.972
A boy.

01:11:51.638 --> 01:11:52.907
It's a boy.

01:12:51.833 --> 01:12:54.233
He's here, he's here!

01:12:54.235 --> 01:12:57.970
- I wanna see him first.
- Me first!

01:12:57.972 --> 01:12:59.704
Who wants to
meet their brother?

01:12:59.706 --> 01:13:00.805
I want to see him.

01:13:00.807 --> 01:13:04.010
All right, oh,
let Mom get out of the car.

01:13:04.012 --> 01:13:05.714
One at a time, girls.

01:13:31.271 --> 01:13:33.674
Tonga has a new son.

01:14:32.066 --> 01:14:34.734
It's true,
Elders and Sisters,

01:14:34.736 --> 01:14:37.135
absolutely true.

01:14:37.137 --> 01:14:40.773
I took that dear
Sister Morley by the hand

01:14:40.775 --> 01:14:44.909
and I promised her,
"Alice," said I,

01:14:44.911 --> 01:14:47.115
"you will be with him again."

01:14:57.290 --> 01:14:59.024
Kolipoki.

01:14:59.026 --> 01:15:00.826
Daddy, you
have to come home.

01:15:00.828 --> 01:15:01.827
What is it, Nancy?

01:15:01.829 --> 01:15:02.831
Johnny's sick.

01:15:09.937 --> 01:15:11.106
Jean!

01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:13.905
Jean, what's happening?

01:15:13.907 --> 01:15:16.078
He won't keep breathing.

01:15:17.011 --> 01:15:18.077
There he goes, there he goes.

01:15:18.079 --> 01:15:19.077
We should take him
to the hospital.

01:15:19.079 --> 01:15:20.211
Yeah, okay.

01:15:20.213 --> 01:15:21.846
We'll give him
a blessing on the way.

01:15:21.848 --> 01:15:25.083
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:15:27.054 --> 01:15:30.855
John Enoch Groberg, by virtue
of the holy priesthood

01:15:30.857 --> 01:15:31.857
and in the name
of Jesus Christ...

01:15:31.859 --> 01:15:32.960
He's not breathing.

01:15:34.995 --> 01:15:36.295
Help, Daddy, help him.

01:15:36.297 --> 01:15:37.866
Whoa, cow!

01:15:39.232 --> 01:15:40.802
Let me drive.

01:15:47.941 --> 01:15:49.975
Get out of the way.

01:15:49.977 --> 01:15:51.346
Go. Yes.

01:15:52.112 --> 01:15:54.814
By the power
of God's priesthood

01:15:54.816 --> 01:15:56.181
and in the name of Jesus Christ,

01:15:56.183 --> 01:15:58.216
I command you to live

01:15:58.218 --> 01:16:00.985
and breath until we can
provide the proper care

01:16:00.987 --> 01:16:03.189
to sustain your life, amen.

01:16:03.191 --> 01:16:04.189
Amen.

01:16:04.191 --> 01:16:05.226
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:16:17.871 --> 01:16:19.137
No, no, Nancy,
you stay in the car.

01:16:19.139 --> 01:16:20.238
I want to see the miracle.

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:22.174
Stay here and pray for it, dear.

01:16:22.176 --> 01:16:23.311
Pray very hard.

01:16:24.945 --> 01:16:28.249
Dear God, Johnny's sick,
please make him better.

01:16:29.883 --> 01:16:31.216
Please, God, no, no, no.

01:16:31.218 --> 01:16:33.918
Come on,
come on, breathe.

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:36.454
- Come on, Johnny.
- Come on, baby.

01:16:36.456 --> 01:16:40.391
Breath.

01:16:40.393 --> 01:16:41.996
Thank you, Lord.

01:16:42.996 --> 01:16:44.199
Thanks be to God.

01:16:49.169 --> 01:16:51.002
Your son is very weak.

01:16:51.004 --> 01:16:53.271
His heart is barely beating.

01:16:53.273 --> 01:16:55.140
He will die soon if we
cannot find the cause

01:16:55.142 --> 01:16:56.308
of this weakness.

01:16:56.310 --> 01:16:58.443
Well, then we should
do some tests.

01:16:58.445 --> 01:17:00.412
We don't have this
kind of test here,

01:17:00.414 --> 01:17:02.113
only in the United States.

01:17:02.115 --> 01:17:04.116
Well, we should fly him there.

01:17:04.118 --> 01:17:06.118
He is dehydrated
and too weak to fly.

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:07.252
He would never make it.

01:17:07.254 --> 01:17:09.056
Well, then what?

01:17:11.124 --> 01:17:14.493
We will try to get
fluids into him

01:17:14.495 --> 01:17:17.899
and we will pray that he gains
the strength to make the trip.

01:17:27.975 --> 01:17:30.176
I'm so sorry
I can't stay longer.

01:17:30.178 --> 01:17:33.045
God's work waits for no one.

01:17:33.047 --> 01:17:35.314
Your
family is God's work.

01:17:35.316 --> 01:17:36.485
I know, I know.

01:17:38.052 --> 01:17:39.918
I know, it's just,
there's a thousand saints

01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:42.523
in Fiji expecting
me next Sunday.

01:17:44.458 --> 01:17:47.529
You are not to go to Fiji
unless John Enoch is stable.

01:17:49.496 --> 01:17:52.167
That's one more reason
to pray for him, isn't it?

01:17:54.067 --> 01:17:57.038
I'll pray for you every minute
of my trip in New Zealand.

01:17:59.206 --> 01:18:00.238
God loves you, John.

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:02.076
Thank you, Elder Monson.

01:18:03.377 --> 01:18:05.077
And so do I.

01:18:05.079 --> 01:18:06.947
Thank you very much.

01:18:52.125 --> 01:18:53.458
We interrupt
this broadcast

01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:55.426
to announce a special need
for faith and prayers

01:18:55.428 --> 01:18:57.162
on behalf of the baby boy

01:18:57.164 --> 01:19:00.064
of the Mormon mission
president, Kolipoki.

01:19:00.066 --> 01:19:01.233
The baby is very sick

01:19:01.235 --> 01:19:03.601
and needs to fly to the United
States for an operation.

01:19:03.603 --> 01:19:05.604
Please pray that the baby
will get well enough

01:19:05.606 --> 01:19:07.338
to fly away soon.

01:19:18.151 --> 01:19:20.185
A fast will be held
through all of Tonga

01:19:20.187 --> 01:19:22.488
for baby boy Groberg tomorrow.

01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:24.523
Anyone discovered
eating before sundown

01:19:24.525 --> 01:19:27.292
will be given an
opportunity to repent

01:19:27.294 --> 01:19:28.627
and fast again the next day.

01:19:51.285 --> 01:19:53.284
You heard it for yourself?

01:19:53.286 --> 01:19:54.556
In the marketplace yesterday.

01:19:56.324 --> 01:19:59.158
Just because the queen is
praying for the palangi boy

01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:00.658
doesn't mean we have to.

01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:04.298
There are many in Tofua who have
sympathy for the little boy.

01:20:04.865 --> 01:20:07.265
Everyone in Tofua
belongs to my church.

01:20:07.267 --> 01:20:08.466
They should know better.

01:20:08.468 --> 01:20:13.073
Everyone in Tofua has been
taught to be Christlike, by you.

01:20:16.643 --> 01:20:20.347
You are a good man, Seoni,
but you are stubborn as a pig.

01:20:21.548 --> 01:20:24.082
You should be praying
for the American boy

01:20:24.084 --> 01:20:25.384
with all your heart.

01:20:25.386 --> 01:20:28.319
You should have
forgiven our son.

01:20:28.321 --> 01:20:30.622
And you should
never ask a Tongan mother

01:20:30.624 --> 01:20:32.558
to choose between her
husband and her son

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:35.230
because you may not like
the choice she makes.

01:20:42.469 --> 01:20:43.538
Ah.

01:20:50.511 --> 01:20:53.415
That's right, just like that.

01:21:01.454 --> 01:21:02.456
Where's your phone?

01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:22.643
It's cooler down here.

01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:29.150
Elder Monson called.

01:21:30.718 --> 01:21:34.153
He said he has a strong feeling
that you and John Enoch

01:21:34.155 --> 01:21:36.387
are gonna be on the
next plane to the US.

01:21:36.389 --> 01:21:38.256
He said he thinks the Lord
will open the way

01:21:38.258 --> 01:21:39.393
to make that happen.

01:21:42.762 --> 01:21:48.699
The doctor tried to get an IV in
for over an hour this morning,

01:21:48.701 --> 01:21:51.172
but he's just too little.

01:21:52.572 --> 01:21:54.739
And dehydrated.

01:21:54.741 --> 01:21:56.244
His veins are too small.

01:22:00.181 --> 01:22:02.450
Has he eaten at all?

01:22:04.317 --> 01:22:06.284
No.

01:22:06.286 --> 01:22:08.222
He's too weak.

01:22:09.490 --> 01:22:12.227
They were hoping to
feed him intravenously.

01:22:18.598 --> 01:22:20.368
How can this happen?

01:22:24.571 --> 01:22:26.473
It can't happen.

01:22:28.342 --> 01:22:29.710
It is happening.

01:22:34.682 --> 01:22:36.614
Why don't you go
be with the girls.

01:22:36.616 --> 01:22:39.451
I'll stay here with Johnny.

01:25:13.374 --> 01:25:15.806
We have brought you
some dinner, Kolipoki.

01:25:15.808 --> 01:25:17.809
Thank you, but I'm fasting.

01:25:17.811 --> 01:25:21.912
No, no, we are fasting
so you don't have too.

01:25:21.914 --> 01:25:23.915
Please
eat this banana bread,

01:25:23.917 --> 01:25:26.451
it'll give you strength to pray.

01:25:26.453 --> 01:25:27.455
Thank you.

01:25:28.222 --> 01:25:30.921
Kolipoki, we have
come to tell you,

01:25:30.923 --> 01:25:33.658
everything is going
to be all right.

01:25:33.660 --> 01:25:36.563
You have? Thank you.

01:25:37.731 --> 01:25:38.729
How do you know?

01:25:38.731 --> 01:25:40.799
We have fasted and prayed

01:25:40.801 --> 01:25:42.801
since this afternoon.

01:25:42.803 --> 01:25:45.804
We will continue
fasting and praying tomorrow

01:25:45.806 --> 01:25:48.806
but God has already
answered our prayer,

01:25:48.808 --> 01:25:50.876
and we wanted you to know

01:25:50.878 --> 01:25:53.511
that everything is
going to be fine.

01:25:53.513 --> 01:25:55.447
It will be fine, Kolipoki.

01:25:55.449 --> 01:25:56.747
We know it.

01:25:56.749 --> 01:25:57.819
Thank you for your faith.

01:25:58.686 --> 01:26:00.786
And thank you for
sharing it with me.

01:26:00.788 --> 01:26:02.586
You're welcome, Kolipoki.

01:26:02.588 --> 01:26:05.357
Now you go to sleep
and get some rest.

01:26:05.359 --> 01:26:07.426
I will try.

01:26:07.428 --> 01:26:09.694
After you eat my
banana bread, Kolipoki.

01:26:09.696 --> 01:26:11.962
- Yes, after.
- Good.

01:26:11.964 --> 01:26:13.564
One more thing, Kolipoki.

01:26:13.566 --> 01:26:14.699
Yes.

01:26:14.701 --> 01:26:16.803
We would like to sing
a little more.

01:26:18.838 --> 01:26:20.874
That would be wonderful.

01:27:03.750 --> 01:27:05.018
He's my son.

01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:12.060
He's my only son.

01:27:43.891 --> 01:27:45.526
Get him!

01:27:52.633 --> 01:27:54.800
Hello, Tonga Toutai Paletu'a.

01:27:54.802 --> 01:27:56.070
What are you doing?

01:27:57.070 --> 01:27:58.906
You have dishonored your father.

01:28:00.139 --> 01:28:02.073
My brother.

01:28:02.075 --> 01:28:03.774
I'm here to teach you a lesson.

01:28:03.776 --> 01:28:05.143
Leave him alone, take me.

01:28:07.114 --> 01:28:09.613
I will take whoever I want.

01:28:09.615 --> 01:28:11.882
I do not
want to fight.

01:28:11.884 --> 01:28:14.051
I am a servant of the Lord now.

01:28:14.053 --> 01:28:15.956
Your Lord will have
to fight for you!

01:28:21.861 --> 01:28:23.961
My Lord has more
important things to do.

01:28:29.035 --> 01:28:31.138
You better
pray to someone else.

01:28:32.572 --> 01:28:34.107
I will pray for you.

01:28:35.676 --> 01:28:37.809
I will pray that the
Lord forgives you.

01:28:37.811 --> 01:28:38.846
Toutai.

01:28:45.151 --> 01:28:49.688
I will pray with all my heart,

01:28:49.690 --> 01:28:51.592
my dear uncle.

01:29:03.070 --> 01:29:04.772
Go, come.

01:29:16.048 --> 01:29:17.083
Nuku!

01:29:18.951 --> 01:29:21.987
Nuku, we need a doctor.

01:29:21.989 --> 01:29:24.189
Can you take him to the
hospital in Nuku'alofa?

01:29:24.191 --> 01:29:25.193
Yes, yes, of course.

01:29:46.914 --> 01:29:49.183
I'll send a telegram
to Kolipoki.

01:29:59.927 --> 01:30:01.027
Kolipoki.

01:30:10.670 --> 01:30:11.672
Nice and easy.

01:30:26.119 --> 01:30:27.217
What have they done to you?

01:30:27.219 --> 01:30:29.688
We have to get him to a doctor.

01:30:29.690 --> 01:30:30.689
Watch his head.

01:30:30.691 --> 01:30:31.689
Yes, the doctor, of course.

01:30:31.691 --> 01:30:32.823
I will pay all.

01:30:32.825 --> 01:30:34.859
Would you like
to come with us?

01:30:34.861 --> 01:30:35.863
Yes.

01:30:38.264 --> 01:30:39.700
Oh, Toutai.

01:30:40.968 --> 01:30:42.803
My son, I'm so sorry.

01:30:45.172 --> 01:30:46.240
I'm so sorry.

01:30:51.178 --> 01:30:53.243
His brain is swollen.

01:30:53.245 --> 01:30:56.014
We won't know anything
until the swelling goes down.

01:30:56.016 --> 01:30:57.716
And how long will that take?

01:30:57.718 --> 01:30:59.850
Could be days, could be months.

01:30:59.852 --> 01:31:02.019
The swelling may never go down.

01:31:02.021 --> 01:31:03.890
Is there anything we can do?

01:31:06.927 --> 01:31:09.030
Have you given him
one of your blessings?

01:31:10.864 --> 01:31:12.266
I think it's time you did.

01:31:17.137 --> 01:31:19.037
Yes!

01:31:19.039 --> 01:31:20.975
Yes!

01:31:22.142 --> 01:31:23.942
Please, Kolipoki,

01:31:23.944 --> 01:31:26.877
please, please, please,
please, Kolipoki,

01:31:26.879 --> 01:31:29.316
do what you need to
to save my son.

01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:50.902
Tonga Toutai Paletu'a,

01:31:50.904 --> 01:31:53.238
by the authority of
God's holy priesthood

01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:55.172
I anoint you with this oil

01:31:55.174 --> 01:31:57.911
which has been set apart
for the healing of the sick.

01:31:59.212 --> 01:32:03.049
I do it in the name
of Jesus Christ, amen.

01:32:04.084 --> 01:32:05.086
Amen.

01:32:13.325 --> 01:32:16.094
Tonga Toutai Paletu'a,

01:32:16.096 --> 01:32:18.063
in the name of Jesus Christ,

01:32:18.065 --> 01:32:20.864
and by the power of
God's holy priesthood

01:32:20.866 --> 01:32:23.001
we lay our hands upon your head

01:32:23.003 --> 01:32:25.239
to seal the anointing
you have been given.

01:32:27.106 --> 01:32:29.841
And we bless you,
Tonga, with the full

01:32:29.843 --> 01:32:32.844
and complete recovery
from all of your injuries.

01:32:32.846 --> 01:32:36.417
This is our blessing
and our promise to you.

01:32:37.817 --> 01:32:40.286
In the name of
Jesus Christ, amen.

01:32:41.420 --> 01:32:42.923
Amen.

01:32:44.191 --> 01:32:46.127
O yah wey!

01:32:48.361 --> 01:32:49.827
Amen.

01:32:49.829 --> 01:32:53.832
Tonga, come back to us!

01:32:56.203 --> 01:32:59.973
O yah wey!

01:33:01.842 --> 01:33:04.007
I'm sorry, I have something
else I need to attend to,

01:33:04.009 --> 01:33:06.277
but I will back to check
on your boy very soon.

01:33:06.279 --> 01:33:07.845
God bless you all.

01:33:07.847 --> 01:33:09.984
Thank you, Kolipoki.

01:33:10.917 --> 01:33:11.919
Saibe.

01:33:17.156 --> 01:33:19.860
O yah wey!

01:33:37.143 --> 01:33:38.178
How is he?

01:33:39.245 --> 01:33:40.480
Alive.

01:33:43.282 --> 01:33:45.119
How's Elder Paletu'a?

01:33:46.285 --> 01:33:47.487
He's pretty beat up.

01:33:49.188 --> 01:33:51.892
But he'll be all right?

01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:55.161
I don't know, Jean.

01:33:56.896 --> 01:33:58.465
I don't know much
of anything anymore.

01:34:01.066 --> 01:34:02.302
Yeah, me neither.

01:34:14.181 --> 01:34:17.451
The doctor tried to put another
needle in this morning.

01:34:19.186 --> 01:34:22.289
It was terrib...
it was just terrible.

01:34:24.990 --> 01:34:27.060
He doesn't even cry anymore.

01:34:29.195 --> 01:34:31.431
I don't know John, I just...

01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:37.170
I'm afraid we're not gonna
ever get him on that plane.

01:34:44.143 --> 01:34:46.112
Would you like to say a prayer?

01:34:47.446 --> 01:34:48.449
No.

01:34:50.417 --> 01:34:52.486
I think I'm all prayed out.

01:34:56.088 --> 01:34:57.357
It's all right.

01:35:02.995 --> 01:35:03.994
Let me take a turn.

01:35:03.996 --> 01:35:05.231
You should go home and rest.

01:35:29.121 --> 01:35:30.124
John.

01:35:31.523 --> 01:35:32.560
Yeah, honey?

01:35:35.395 --> 01:35:39.532
If by the time
I come back, he's gone...

01:35:42.502 --> 01:35:45.205
It's not your fault, okay?

01:35:46.373 --> 01:35:47.374
Okay?

01:35:51.343 --> 01:35:53.279
It's not your fault.

01:36:01.521 --> 01:36:03.057
I love you.

01:37:19.199 --> 01:37:21.698
Dear God,

01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:23.670
dear Heavenly Father.

01:37:26.205 --> 01:37:27.238
I do not know why

01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:29.676
you have brought this
white man to my island.

01:37:32.245 --> 01:37:34.515
I do not believe
what he teaches.

01:37:36.348 --> 01:37:39.583
But my son is dying

01:37:39.585 --> 01:37:42.353
and his son is dying,

01:37:42.355 --> 01:37:45.459
and he has tried to heal my son.

01:37:48.361 --> 01:37:51.231
So now I will try to heal his.

01:37:52.531 --> 01:37:56.367
Hear me, Father in heaven,

01:37:56.369 --> 01:37:58.269
hear me now

01:37:58.271 --> 01:38:00.741
and heal this white man's boy.

01:38:03.642 --> 01:38:06.676
Because he has done
nothing to hurt his son

01:38:06.678 --> 01:38:08.648
like I have hurt mine.

01:38:12.718 --> 01:38:16.421
If you heal my boy
and take his away,

01:38:16.423 --> 01:38:19.290
I would be so mad at you.

01:38:19.292 --> 01:38:21.695
I do not think I could
ever come to heaven.

01:38:23.228 --> 01:38:25.199
I will have to go to hell.

01:38:26.598 --> 01:38:31.435
And that would be bad for
the people in my church

01:38:31.437 --> 01:38:35.308
because they depend on me
to be better than I am.

01:38:38.178 --> 01:38:40.778
So please,

01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:44.282
heal this man's boy,

01:38:44.284 --> 01:38:46.783
and heal mine after.

01:38:46.785 --> 01:38:50.190
And if you have a little time...

01:38:51.257 --> 01:38:55.462
Please tell me what to do with
this white man sitting here.

01:38:57.664 --> 01:39:03.637
I do not know if I should
love him or hate him.

01:39:07.473 --> 01:39:08.475
Amen.

01:39:11.276 --> 01:39:12.612
Amen.

01:39:16.749 --> 01:39:19.286
I'm sorry I borrowed your baby.

01:39:21.553 --> 01:39:25.491
I wanted to see if
I could help him.

01:39:29.795 --> 01:39:32.796
I think he would
get better faster

01:39:32.798 --> 01:39:36.636
if the people from my church
are praying for him too.

01:39:38.370 --> 01:39:40.373
I think you're probably right.

01:39:49.648 --> 01:39:51.681
I felt something

01:39:51.683 --> 01:39:53.719
when I laid my hands
on your baby.

01:39:55.655 --> 01:39:58.659
I felt that he will
grow to be a great man.

01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:04.464
I felt that about your son also.

01:40:17.276 --> 01:40:19.609
Is there a
doctor on board?

01:40:19.611 --> 01:40:21.578
I'm a doctor.

01:40:21.580 --> 01:40:25.349
I say, chappies,
unhand me this instant,

01:40:25.351 --> 01:40:29.586
or I'll report you to Her
Majesty, the Queen of England.

01:40:29.588 --> 01:40:32.290
It wasn't enough that you
pull me off my aircraft,

01:40:32.292 --> 01:40:34.824
now you drag me around
like a common criminal.

01:40:34.826 --> 01:40:37.561
I do say, I must say
there's no kind of excuse

01:40:37.563 --> 01:40:39.497
for this kind of comport...

01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:44.303
Oh, I see.

01:40:46.405 --> 01:40:49.509
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:40:53.312 --> 01:40:55.414
I'm so glad you brought me here.

01:41:03.556 --> 01:41:05.625
Right there into the cut.

01:41:06.625 --> 01:41:09.359
Pull up the vein.

01:41:09.361 --> 01:41:11.494
I was taught this
technique in Australia,

01:41:11.496 --> 01:41:12.762
why weren't you there?

01:41:12.764 --> 01:41:14.433
I had to stay with the boy.

01:41:15.602 --> 01:41:18.405
Right, jolly right.

01:41:19.472 --> 01:41:20.607
Now slice it open.

01:41:23.942 --> 01:41:25.512
Needle.

01:41:34.954 --> 01:41:36.557
Bang on.

01:41:39.525 --> 01:41:41.361
He did it.

01:41:42.195 --> 01:41:43.597
Let's attach the bag.

01:41:48.567 --> 01:41:51.902
Now, if you don't mind,

01:41:51.904 --> 01:41:54.975
I have an aircraft full of angry
passengers awaiting my return.

01:41:55.775 --> 01:41:57.507
Thank you for your help.

01:41:57.509 --> 01:41:59.510
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you.

01:41:59.512 --> 01:42:02.416
Bloody well didn't have
a choice, did I? No.

01:42:04.784 --> 01:42:06.520
But you're welcome.

01:42:32.779 --> 01:42:35.549
John! John, wake up.

01:42:42.954 --> 01:42:45.689
Hello, little man.

01:42:45.691 --> 01:42:48.792
Welcome back, welcome back.

01:42:48.794 --> 01:42:51.761
I'm so glad you can cry again.

01:42:51.763 --> 01:42:53.698
Look, look.

01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:55.702
- Look, look.
- Oh.

01:42:56.768 --> 01:42:57.835
Look, look.

01:43:06.812 --> 01:43:07.980
Seoni.

01:43:10.583 --> 01:43:11.985
Seoni.

01:43:17.456 --> 01:43:19.857
Your prayers have worked.

01:43:19.859 --> 01:43:22.596
The little boy is better.

01:43:43.482 --> 01:43:46.652
Seoni, Seoni.

01:43:50.623 --> 01:43:52.025
My boy.

01:43:57.062 --> 01:43:58.931
My boy.

01:44:01.534 --> 01:44:02.536
Home.

01:44:03.835 --> 01:44:05.068
Home.

01:44:05.070 --> 01:44:08.507
Yes, my son, you have come home.

01:44:21.654 --> 01:44:25.622
Okay, girls, it's time
to say good-bye to Mommy.

01:44:25.624 --> 01:44:27.127
Don't go, Mommy.

01:44:29.529 --> 01:44:31.929
It's gonna be
all right. Okay?

01:44:31.931 --> 01:44:33.866
You need to be strong.

01:44:36.636 --> 01:44:39.569
- I hate it when Daddy cooks.
- Oh!

01:44:39.571 --> 01:44:42.575
Me too.

01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:45.779
I won't be gone long.

01:44:54.754 --> 01:44:56.554
I never thought
you flying away

01:44:56.556 --> 01:44:58.823
would be the answer
to my prayers.

01:44:58.825 --> 01:45:01.962
Yeah, it does seem kinda
backwards, doesn't it?

01:45:03.094 --> 01:45:05.664
- Yes, it does.
- All aboard.

01:45:07.633 --> 01:45:10.570
Okay, well, I guess I better go.

01:45:17.576 --> 01:45:18.742
I love you.

01:45:18.744 --> 01:45:20.914
I love you too.

01:46:11.897 --> 01:46:13.831
Bang, bang, I got you, Liz.

01:46:13.833 --> 01:46:16.934
You can't get me,
I just got you.

01:46:16.936 --> 01:46:19.673
Bang, bang,
bang, bang, boom.

01:46:21.641 --> 01:46:23.774
Elders and Sisters,

01:46:23.776 --> 01:46:26.042
thank you for your patience.

01:46:26.044 --> 01:46:29.779
Before we adjourn,
we have some new missionaries,

01:46:29.781 --> 01:46:32.716
and I'd like to announce
their mission assignments.

01:46:32.718 --> 01:46:34.150
Sister Mokena?

01:46:34.152 --> 01:46:35.786
You've been
assigned to serve

01:46:35.788 --> 01:46:38.725
with Sister Isikiela
in the village of Tokomolu.

01:46:39.825 --> 01:46:41.125
Thank you, President.

01:46:41.127 --> 01:46:42.960
Elder Hinton,

01:46:42.962 --> 01:46:45.162
Elder Manu,

01:46:45.164 --> 01:46:47.901
you've been assigned the
island of Ha'ano and Ha'apai.

01:46:54.272 --> 01:46:56.239
Elder Fonua.

01:46:56.241 --> 01:46:58.676
- Nuku!
- Miracle man.

01:47:00.879 --> 01:47:03.079
I'll miss you too.
Go back, go back, go back.

01:47:03.081 --> 01:47:05.683
Welcome to your mission, Nuku.

01:47:05.685 --> 01:47:07.952
Thank you, Kolipoki.

01:47:07.954 --> 01:47:10.857
You have been assigned to
work with Elder Paletu'a...

01:47:12.892 --> 01:47:14.694
In the village of Tofua.

01:47:15.494 --> 01:47:17.764
The home of Elder
Paletu'as father.

01:47:21.968 --> 01:47:23.967
Are you s...

01:47:23.969 --> 01:47:25.972
are you sure, Kolipoki?

01:47:27.272 --> 01:47:29.708
Yes, I am sure.

01:47:33.245 --> 01:47:34.778
Then thank you.

01:47:34.780 --> 01:47:36.282
Thank you for sending me there.

01:47:46.124 --> 01:47:49.194
Elders Nefai and Sitadini.

01:47:52.197 --> 01:47:56.100
And they all
lived happily ever after.

01:47:56.102 --> 01:47:57.868
Good night, girls.

01:47:57.870 --> 01:47:59.836
Good night, Daddy.

01:47:59.838 --> 01:48:00.839
Good night.

01:48:02.842 --> 01:48:03.843
Daddy?

01:48:04.776 --> 01:48:05.975
Yes, Nancy?

01:48:05.977 --> 01:48:07.845
Are you sure that if
you wait long enough

01:48:07.847 --> 01:48:09.747
all stories have happy endings?

01:48:09.749 --> 01:48:10.948
I'm sure.

01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:13.853
Then why hasn't
Mommy come home yet?

01:48:15.154 --> 01:48:17.324
I guess we haven't waited
long enough yet, hmm.

01:48:18.891 --> 01:48:20.157
Hey, you know what?

01:48:20.159 --> 01:48:23.292
Your brother is getting
better and better,

01:48:23.294 --> 01:48:25.162
and your grandma and grandpa
are getting ready

01:48:25.164 --> 01:48:26.162
to take care of him,

01:48:26.164 --> 01:48:30.869
and then Mommy will
come back to us, promise.

01:48:32.937 --> 01:48:34.171
Daddy?

01:48:34.173 --> 01:48:36.172
Yes, Nancy.

01:48:36.174 --> 01:48:39.143
I think you're handling
this all very well.

01:48:39.145 --> 01:48:40.810
Me too.

01:48:40.812 --> 01:48:43.115
Thank you, girls. Good night.

01:48:43.883 --> 01:48:46.386
- Good night.
- Good night, Daddy.

01:48:47.386 --> 01:48:49.185
Get under those covers.

01:49:07.405 --> 01:49:10.073
Dear Jean,

01:49:10.075 --> 01:49:14.010
how I wish you could be
here with me and the girls,

01:49:14.012 --> 01:49:18.217
how I wish you could see
our great missionaries.

01:49:19.884 --> 01:49:25.221
But whether you
are there, or here...

01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:31.897
I sent Elder Paletu'a to
his father's village today.

01:49:33.833 --> 01:49:38.303
It was one of those times
the spirit whispered "yes."

01:49:40.106 --> 01:49:43.372
Having my own son so far away,

01:49:43.374 --> 01:49:46.212
thinking of his
father losing his...

01:49:48.146 --> 01:49:50.249
Can you imagine it, Jean?

01:49:51.984 --> 01:49:53.419
Can you really imagine it?

01:49:55.387 --> 01:49:58.924
God sending His
only son to Earth.

01:50:02.093 --> 01:50:03.096
To die.

01:50:06.097 --> 01:50:08.368
But he did it.

01:50:09.401 --> 01:50:10.870
He did.

01:50:12.338 --> 01:50:14.174
He really did.

01:50:18.009 --> 01:50:21.414
I wish you could see...

01:50:23.182 --> 01:50:24.984
- What I see.
- I see.

01:53:46.672 --> 01:53:51.672
