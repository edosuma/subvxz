PEOPLE DON'T REMEMBER, I VAGUELY

10:19.466 --> 10:21.333
REMEMBER SUN CITY WAS THE

10:21.400 --> 10:24.100
LAS VEGAS OF SOUTH AFRICA.

10:24.166 --> 10:24.800
I REMEMBER EVERYBODY PLAYED IT.

10:24.866 --> 10:27.800
FRANK SINATRA OPENED IT BUT LOTS

10:27.866 --> 10:31.066
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE KNOWN AS BIG

10:31.133 --> 10:31.966
LIBERALS IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY

10:32.033 --> 10:35.533
PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO BE

10:35.600 --> 10:37.500
REMINDED -- THERE WAS THIS

10:37.566 --> 10:38.700
PRESSURE THAT YOU PUT ON.

10:38.766 --> 10:40.766
IT WAS LIKE WHY ARE YOU GOING

10:40.833 --> 10:42.000
THERE TO SOUTH AFRICA, THIS IS

10:42.066 --> 10:45.133
AN APARTHEID REGIME?

10:45.200 --> 10:48.733
>> LET'S ASSUME THEY WERE

10:48.800 --> 10:49.700
MANIPULATED WHICH THEY WERE,

10:49.766 --> 10:52.533
LET'S NOT HAVE INFIGHTING

10:52.600 --> 10:53.600
AMONGST THE MUSIC PEOPLE, LET'S

10:53.666 --> 10:55.400
KEEP OUR EYE ON THE BALL BECAUSE

10:55.466 --> 10:58.433
WE HAD A BIGGER GOAL IN MIND

10:58.500 --> 10:59.866
WHICH WAS TO RAISE ENOUGH

10:59.933 --> 11:00.366
CONSCIOUSNESS TO GET THE

11:00.433 --> 11:04.100
SANCTIONS BILL PASSED.

11:04.166 --> 11:05.166
WE KNOW IT WHEN IT CAME UP,

11:05.233 --> 11:09.766
RONALD REAGAN WAS GONNA VETO IT.

11:09.833 --> 11:13.266
HE WAS PART OF THAT UNHOLY

11:13.333 --> 11:18.700
TRINITY -- HE WAS A

11:18.766 --> 11:20.133
GRANDFATHERLY, COWBOY, HAPPY

11:20.200 --> 11:22.066
COWBOY AND ALL THESE CRIMES ARE

11:22.133 --> 11:25.500
GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES.

11:25.566 --> 11:26.966
WE DID TO RAISE THAT

11:27.033 --> 11:28.400
CONSCIOUSNESS ENOUGH THAT WHEN

11:28.466 --> 11:29.066
THE SANCTIONS BILL CAME UP WHICH

11:29.133 --> 11:32.666
WAS THE HOME RUN -- SPORTS

11:32.733 --> 11:34.300
BOYCOTT FIRST WHICH WAS IN

11:34.366 --> 11:35.266
PLACE, THE CULTURAL BOYCOTT

11:35.333 --> 11:36.600
WHICH IS WHAT WE DID AND THE

11:36.666 --> 11:40.200
ECONOMIC SANCTIONS.

11:40.266 --> 11:42.800
ONCE IT CAME UP HE DID VETO IT

11:42.866 --> 11:44.666
BUT WE OVERRODE THE VETO BECAUSE

11:44.733 --> 11:46.833
WE RAISE THE CONSCIOUSNESS SO

11:46.900 --> 11:48.566
MUCH.

11:48.633 --> 11:51.733
REPUBLICANS VOTED FOR IT.

11:51.800 --> 11:52.966
RICHARD LUGAR AND REPUBLICANS

11:53.033 --> 11:55.366
VOTED FOR THE SANCTIONS BILL,

11:55.433 --> 11:56.333
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

11:56.400 --> 11:58.100
REPUBLICANS VOTING SO BLACK

11:58.166 --> 11:58.733
PEOPLE COULD VOTE?

11:58.800 --> 11:59.800
>> Bill: DIFFERENT ERA, VERY

11:59.866 --> 12:02.866
DIFFERENT ERA.

12:02.933 --> 12:04.200
YOU DID ALL THAT AND YET YOU

12:04.266 --> 12:07.566
STILL DIDN'T STARVE.

12:07.633 --> 12:11.200
YOU STILL HAD SOME MONEY.

12:11.266 --> 12:15.466
>> IS NOT THE MONEY THING SO

12:15.533 --> 12:16.600
MUCH, I'VE HAD WONDERFUL

12:16.666 --> 12:17.300
SUCCESSES.

12:17.366 --> 12:18.433
I DON'T WANT TO EVER SOUND

12:18.500 --> 12:20.400
UNGRATEFUL ABOUT THE

12:20.466 --> 12:24.066
E STREET BAND AND SOPRANOS AND

12:24.133 --> 12:29.366
LILYHAMMER AND SUN CITY PROJECT.

12:29.433 --> 12:31.566
MY OWN PERSONAL STUFF, MY

12:31.633 --> 12:32.666
PERSONAL RECORDS THAT YOU HAD ON

12:32.733 --> 12:35.433
THE SCREEN UP THERE, HAVE NOT

12:35.500 --> 12:36.433
FOUND AN AUDIENCE.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.500
THE POINT IS YOU'RE GOING TO GO

12:38.566 --> 12:39.100
THROUGH LIFE, YOU'RE GOING TO

12:39.166 --> 12:41.900
HAVE SOME FRUSTRATION, EVERYBODY

12:41.966 --> 12:43.800
IS AND THAT IS WHEN UNIVERSAL

12:43.866 --> 12:46.066
THEMES START TO HAPPEN.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.166
IT'S NOT A MATTER OF ARE YOU

12:48.233 --> 12:48.800
GOING TO BE DISAPPOINTED, IT'S

12:48.866 --> 12:51.266
WHAT DO YOU DO AFTER THAT?

12:51.333 --> 12:53.100
DO YOU GIVE UP AND THROW IN THE

12:53.166 --> 12:54.766
TOWEL OR DO YOU FIND A WAY TO

12:54.833 --> 12:55.133
MOVE FORWARD?

12:55.200 --> 12:57.700
I HOPE THE BOOK IS USEFUL THAT

12:57.766 --> 12:57.866
WAY.

12:57.933 --> 13:00.166
>> Bill: I THINK IT WILL BE,

13:00.233 --> 13:01.133
IT'S REALLY INTERESTING THE WAY

13:01.200 --> 13:03.500
YOU DRAW THIS PARALLEL

13:03.566 --> 13:06.066
BETWEEN -- I THINK THE WORD IS

13:06.133 --> 13:13.400
CONSIGLIO VERY -- SO YOU WERE

13:13.466 --> 13:15.900
KIND OF LIKE THAT IN THE

13:15.966 --> 13:16.533
E STREET BAND AND THAT'S THE

13:16.600 --> 13:18.633
PART YOU PLAYED ON

13:18.700 --> 13:21.833
"THE SOPRANOS."

13:21.900 --> 13:26.233
[LAUGHTER]

13:26.300 --> 13:28.100
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

13:46.033 --> 13:46.433
ME.

13:46.500 --> 13:47.766
>> Bill: BUT IT WORKED BECAUSE

13:47.833 --> 13:49.166
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO STRETCH TOO

13:49.233 --> 13:53.433
FAR IN YOUR MIND FOR THAT ROLE.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.866
>> IT DEVELOPED INTO THAT, IT

13:55.933 --> 13:57.266
DIDN'T START OFF THAT WAY, IT

13:57.333 --> 13:59.933
STARTED OFF RUNNING THE STRIP

14:00.000 --> 14:01.133
CLUB FOR THE FAMILY AND WE WOULD

14:01.200 --> 14:03.333
MEET IN THE BACK ROOM, THAT

14:03.400 --> 14:05.300
WOULD BE OUR OFFICE.

14:05.366 --> 14:05.966
THE FIRST SEASON DEVELOPED INTO

14:06.033 --> 14:09.333
THAT UNDERBOSS ROLE.

14:09.400 --> 14:11.533

14:11.600 --> 14:13.666
WOULD AGREE WITH THE McCARTNEY

14:13.733 --> 14:15.333
THING USED TO SAY, I WOULD

14:15.400 --> 14:17.500
RATHER HAVE A BAND THAN A

ROLLS-ROYCE.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.900
I'M GUESSING YOU WOULD AGREE

14:19.966 --> 14:20.966
WITH THAT STATEMENT, YOU LOVE

14:30.133 --> 14:34.800
MAY BE TOO MANY BANDS NOW?

14:34.866 --> 14:41.566
I DID THE THING EARLIER -- IT'S

14:45.066 --> 14:49.833

15:33.166 --> 15:35.800

15:35.866 --> 15:40.500

THOUGH THE ROCK BUSINESS IS KIND

15:41.266 --> 15:45.000
OF OVER E AS FAR AS THE INDUSTRY

WE ONLY DID FOUR A COUPLE TIMES

THE OTHER MORE MODERATE SIDE,

18:59.600 --> 19:06.033
THEY ARE VERY MAD -- KIERSTEN

19:06.100 --> 19:08.700

19:34.566 --> 19:36.333
THE PULSE OF THE AVERAGE

19:36.400 --> 19:36.900
DEMOCRAT IN THE COUNTRY?

19:36.966 --> 19:39.066

19:39.133 --> 19:42.133
THIS IS JUST PEOPLE SHOUTING

19:42.200 --> 19:42.733
THOSE $2 TRILLION NUMBERS AT

19:42.800 --> 19:45.733
EACH OTHER OVER AND OVER.

19:45.800 --> 19:49.633
WE HAVE THIS IDEA -- NOBODY

19:49.700 --> 19:51.033
KNOWS WHAT'S IN THE BILLS.

19:51.100 --> 19:53.066
>> Bill: I FIND THAT TO BE A

19:53.133 --> 19:53.300
PROBLEM.

19:53.366 --> 19:54.466
>> A HUGE PROBLEM.

19:54.533 --> 19:56.266
THERE'S A BRIEF MOMENT LAST WEEK

19:56.333 --> 19:58.300
WERE ACTUALLY THE $3.5 TRILLION

19:58.366 --> 20:00.433
BILL WAS A $0 BILL, THERE WAS

20:00.500 --> 20:02.100
THIS BIG FIGHT BECAUSE IT'S PAID

20:02.166 --> 20:03.866
FOR, IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE MONEY

20:03.933 --> 20:05.833
COMES FROM NOWHERE, IT'S FINE.

20:05.900 --> 20:07.933
>> Bill: OBAMACARE WAS PAID

20:08.000 --> 20:09.566
FOR, I FEEL LIKE THAT WAS SUCH A

20:09.633 --> 20:11.566
DIFFERENT ERA WHEN THAT WAS A

20:11.633 --> 20:13.300
THING TO AT LEAST TRY TO PAY FOR

20:13.366 --> 20:14.033
YOUR BILL.

20:14.100 --> 20:15.800
>> THERE ARE PAY FOURS IN BOTH

20:15.866 --> 20:17.766
OF THESE BILLS BUT THE FACT

20:17.833 --> 20:18.400
THAT -- OBVIOUSLY THERE'S GOING

20:18.466 --> 20:21.933
TO BE A HUGE AMOUNT OF COUNTING

20:22.000 --> 20:23.966
TRICKERY, THAT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO

20:24.033 --> 20:24.200
HAPPEN.

20:24.266 --> 20:27.533
I THINK YOU WERE RIGHT, THE

20:27.600 --> 20:28.400
AMERICAN PUBLIC IT'S NOT CLEAR

20:28.466 --> 20:29.866
WHAT THEY VOTED FOR WHEN THEY

20:29.933 --> 20:31.600
VOTED FOR JOE BIDEN WHO WAS

20:31.666 --> 20:35.466
PERCEIVED AS A MODERATE,

20:35.533 --> 20:36.066
$3.5 TRILLION OF MASSIVE NEW

20:36.133 --> 20:38.033
SOCIAL PROGRAMS, IT MAY NOT BE

20:38.100 --> 20:38.466
WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO.

20:38.533 --> 20:41.733
IT'S REASONABLE ENOUGH FOR

20:41.800 --> 20:42.700
REPRESENTATIVES TO SAY CAN WE

20:42.766 --> 20:44.466
TALK ABOUT THIS A LITTLE MORE?

20:44.533 --> 20:47.100
>> IT'S INTERESTING IN THE MEDIA

20:47.166 --> 20:48.533
FROM THAT STANDPOINT HOW QUICKLY

20:48.600 --> 20:53.500
WE HAVE GONE FROM BELIEVING --

20:53.566 --> 20:54.500
MOST MEDIA PEOPLE BELIEF DEFICIT

20:54.566 --> 20:56.666
SPENDING WAS A GOOD THING AND WE

20:56.733 --> 20:59.066
NEED MORE OF THAT.

20:59.133 --> 21:00.133
NOW IT'S LIKE MONETARY THEORY,

21:00.200 --> 21:01.366
THIS A LIMITLESS AMOUNT OF MONEY

21:01.433 --> 21:04.866
WE CAN SPEND AND WE SHOULD NEVER

21:04.933 --> 21:06.033
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ACCOUNTING

21:06.100 --> 21:09.166
AGAIN OR PAYING FOR THINGS AGAIN

21:09.233 --> 21:10.933
AND I THINK IT'S INTERESTING

21:11.000 --> 21:11.700
ALMOST EVERYBODY WHO COVERS THIS

21:11.766 --> 21:14.866
STUFF BELIEVES THAT.

21:14.933 --> 21:16.733
>> THERE'S THIS WEIRD PRETENSE

21:16.800 --> 21:18.466
THAT WE ALWAYS BELIEVED IT TO.

21:18.533 --> 21:20.833
THIS IS A VERY NEW IDEA TO SAY

21:20.900 --> 21:23.066
ACTUALLY YOU CAN DEFINITELY

21:23.133 --> 21:24.700
SPEND TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND

21:24.766 --> 21:26.100
IT MEANS NOTHING FOR WHAT YOUR

21:26.166 --> 21:27.500
CHILDREN WILL HAVE TO PAY BACK,

21:27.566 --> 21:28.633
WHAT RESOURCES WE WILL HAVE IF

21:28.700 --> 21:30.466
THERE'S ANOTHER CRISIS IN THE

21:30.533 --> 21:32.633
FUTURE AND I JUST DON'T BUY

21:32.700 --> 21:32.833
THAT.

21:32.900 --> 21:36.700
>> Bill: I FEEL LIKE COVID

21:36.766 --> 21:39.333
CHANGE THAT, YOU ARE A BOOK

21:39.400 --> 21:40.200
SHOCK DOCTRINE -- THE THEORY

21:40.266 --> 21:42.533
NEVER LET A CRISIS GO TO WASTE,

21:42.600 --> 21:44.066
WE SAW HOW THE REPUBLICANS DID

21:44.133 --> 21:45.666
IT WHEN 9/11 HAPPENED AND WE

21:45.733 --> 21:49.866
ALWAYS WANTED TO INVADE IRAQ

21:49.933 --> 21:51.500
AGAIN.

21:51.566 --> 21:53.600
AND I FEEL LIKE THIS IS KIND OF

21:53.666 --> 21:55.666
WHAT THE OTHER SIDE DID WITH

21:55.733 --> 21:57.033
COVID, THEY ALWAYS WANTED TO

21:57.100 --> 21:57.866
SEND MORE CHECKS TO PEOPLE WHO

21:57.933 --> 21:59.000
HAVE KIDS.

21:59.066 --> 22:03.166
PART OF THIS BILL IS ANYBODY WHO

22:03.233 --> 22:06.566
WAS MAKING $400,000 GETS $2,000

22:06.633 --> 22:08.800
A KID.

22:08.866 --> 22:11.033
BABY BONUS.

22:11.100 --> 22:12.466
>> THIS A LOT OF STUFF IN THIS

22:12.533 --> 22:13.866
BILL THAT'S GOING TO GO TO

22:13.933 --> 22:15.500
PEOPLE WHO ARE BETTER OFF, IT'S

22:15.566 --> 22:16.900
A REASONABLE ENOUGH QUESTION TO

22:16.966 --> 22:18.100
SAY THERE ARE PEOPLE SUFFERING

22:18.166 --> 22:19.300
IN THIS COUNTRY, THEY NEED HELP

22:19.366 --> 22:20.766
AND MAYBE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

22:20.833 --> 22:22.700
OCCASIONALLY SHOULD HELP WITH

22:22.766 --> 22:25.733
THAT BUT THAT IS NOT WITH THESE

22:25.800 --> 22:26.166
$3.5 TRILLION ARE.

22:26.233 --> 22:27.700
IT'S EVERYTHING EVERY DEMOCRAT

22:27.766 --> 22:29.433
EVER WANTED TO DO.

22:29.500 --> 22:29.966
>> Bill: ISN'T HAVING KIDS

22:30.033 --> 22:32.633
JUST A CHOICE?

22:32.700 --> 22:33.133
CURRENTLY PICKING WINNERS

22:33.200 --> 22:34.900
WINNERS AND LOSERS THERE?

22:34.966 --> 22:36.066
>> YOU'RE NOW ALONE, THE

22:36.133 --> 22:37.766
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS MOST

22:37.833 --> 22:44.666
WANT TO SUBSIDIZE.

22:44.733 --> 22:46.566
>> Bill: IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A

22:46.633 --> 22:48.433
BILL THAT'S A GREENVILLE, KIDS

22:48.500 --> 22:50.266
AREN'T GREEN, HAVING MORE PEOPLE

22:50.333 --> 22:50.633
ARE GREEN.

22:50.700 --> 22:51.866
>> YOU HAVE NOT SEEN MY CHILDREN

22:51.933 --> 22:55.933
AFTER THEY HAVE PEAS.

22:56.000 --> 22:56.500
[LAUGHTER]

22:56.566 --> 22:58.500
>> A LOT OF THE SAME PEOPLE WHO

22:58.566 --> 23:00.366
ARE SAYING WE NEED THE

23:00.433 --> 23:02.100
$3.5 TRILLION BILL ARE THE SAME

23:02.166 --> 23:04.233
PEOPLE WHO ARE ARGUING AGAINST

23:04.300 --> 23:05.333
IT WHEN BERNIE SANDERS WAS

23:05.400 --> 23:06.833
RUNNING AGAINST JOE BIDEN JUST A

23:06.900 --> 23:09.433
YEAR AGO, I THINK THAT'S

23:09.500 --> 23:09.833
INTERESTING TOO.

23:09.900 --> 23:11.466
A LOT OF PUNDITS HAVE COMPLETELY

23:11.533 --> 23:12.833
CHANGE THEIR MINDS ABOUT THIS.

23:12.900 --> 23:14.633
>> AND REPUBLICANS DESTROYED

23:14.700 --> 23:19.166
THEIR CREDIBILITY AS RESPONSIBLE

23:19.233 --> 23:20.066
PHYSICAL STEWARDS.

23:20.133 --> 23:21.166
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP

23:21.233 --> 23:22.466
THAT IN MIND.

23:22.533 --> 23:25.900
[APPLAUSE]

23:25.966 --> 23:27.033
DONALD TRUMP GOT UP THERE AND

23:27.100 --> 23:28.700
SAID I NEED A COUPLE TRILLION

23:28.766 --> 23:29.600
DOLLARS AND THEY WERE LIKE HERE

23:29.666 --> 23:31.333
YOU GO, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO.

23:31.400 --> 23:32.733
>> Bill: THEY DESTROYED IT WAY

23:32.800 --> 23:34.400
BEFORE THAT, THEY'VE BEEN DOING

23:34.466 --> 23:35.166
THAT FOREVER.

23:35.233 --> 23:36.500
>> THEY WERE ALREADY IN A WEAK

23:36.566 --> 23:37.966
PLACE AND THEY BLEW IT.

23:38.033 --> 23:39.133
>> Bill: THE DEMOCRATS WOULD

23:39.200 --> 23:40.733
COME IN AND CLEAN UP THEIR MESS

23:40.800 --> 23:42.366
AND SOMEHOW THEY WOULD STILL

23:42.433 --> 23:42.966
HAVE THE REPUTATION AS THE

23:43.033 --> 23:44.466
PEOPLE WHO WOULD LOOK AFTER YOUR

23:44.533 --> 23:46.233
MONEY, I NEVER UNDERSTOOD HOW

23:46.300 --> 23:47.833
THAT HAPPENS.

23:47.900 --> 23:49.466
>> THEY KEEP SAYING IT DURING

23:49.533 --> 23:51.666
ELECTIONS AND PEOPLE LIKE IT

23:51.733 --> 23:52.333
BECAUSE AMERICANS ACTUALLY DO

23:52.400 --> 23:53.833
LIKE THE IDEA THAT THEIR

23:53.900 --> 23:55.433
GOVERNMENT MIGHT BE KIND OF

23:55.500 --> 23:56.366
FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE AND

23:56.433 --> 23:57.500
REPUBLICANS GOT AWAY WITH THE

23:57.566 --> 23:59.166
RHETORIC FOR A LOT LONGER THAN

23:59.233 --> 24:02.866
THE REALITY SUPPORTED IT.

24:02.933 --> 24:04.533
>> Bill: TWO FOR YEARS OF

24:04.600 --> 24:05.466
COMMUNITY COLLEGE, I THOUGHT OF

24:05.533 --> 24:08.133
THAT WHEN I READ YOUR ARTICLE

24:08.200 --> 24:10.300
THIS WEEK ABOUT DOES AMERICA

24:10.366 --> 24:11.233
HATE THE POORLY EDUCATED?

24:11.300 --> 24:13.000
I WAS SAYING A FEW WEEKS AGO,

24:13.066 --> 24:14.766
MAYBE MONTHS AGO, WHO KNOWS -- I

24:14.833 --> 24:18.466
SMOKE POT.

24:18.533 --> 24:19.033
[LAUGHTER]

24:19.100 --> 24:21.633
WHENEVER IT WAS, I'M NOT SO SURE

24:21.700 --> 24:22.400
THAT THE IDEA THAT THE MORE

24:22.466 --> 24:24.033
EDUCATION WE GET THE BETTER WE

24:24.100 --> 24:25.233
ARE.

24:25.300 --> 24:25.800
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE

24:25.866 --> 24:27.633
TEACHING AT THE COLLEGES, I

24:27.700 --> 24:28.233
DON'T THINK THEY ARE TEACHING

24:28.300 --> 24:31.766
THE SUBJECT'S THAT ARE

24:31.833 --> 24:32.400
SUBSTANTIVE ANYMORE, MAYBE SOME

24:32.466 --> 24:36.233
OF THEM ARE.

24:36.300 --> 24:37.466
ALSO THIS IDEA THAT MORE SITTING

24:37.533 --> 24:41.166
IN CLASSROOMS MAKES YOU MORE

24:41.233 --> 24:44.866
ABLE TO NAVIGATE THE WORLD.

24:44.933 --> 24:46.900
YOU QUOTED A GUY WHO CAME UP

24:46.966 --> 24:55.433
WITH THIS -- I LOVE THIS PHRASE,

24:55.500 --> 24:57.400
PRUDENTIAL-ISM LOOKING DOWN ON

24:57.466 --> 24:58.000
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE ANY SORT

24:58.066 --> 25:01.000
OF DEGREE.

25:01.066 --> 25:01.800
INSTEAD OF GETTING EVERYBODY

25:01.866 --> 25:03.466
WITH A DEGREE, WHY DON'T WE JUST

25:03.533 --> 25:05.333
BE HONEST THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T

25:05.400 --> 25:05.900
NEED A DEGREE AND IT'S A

25:05.966 --> 25:17.366
BULLSHIT THING TO BEGIN WITH.

25:17.433 --> 25:18.666
>> I COVERED A LOT OF THINGS

25:18.733 --> 25:20.033
ABOUT STUDENT LOANS AND PEOPLE

25:20.100 --> 25:21.266
HAVE TO FACE THAT HIGHER

25:21.333 --> 25:24.866
EDUCATION AMERICA IS KIND OF A

25:24.933 --> 25:25.600
SCAM.

25:25.666 --> 25:27.600
YOU NEED TO GO TO COLLEGE TO GET

25:27.666 --> 25:28.166
A GOOD PROFESSIONAL JOB BUT

25:28.233 --> 25:31.633
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE -- THE

25:31.700 --> 25:32.366
LIKELIHOOD IS VERY POOR THAT

25:32.433 --> 25:34.200
YOU'RE GOING TO GET A GOOD JOB

25:34.266 --> 25:35.833
OUT OF COLLEGE FOR MOST PEOPLE

25:35.900 --> 25:37.933
BUT YOU HAVE TO GET THE

25:38.000 --> 25:39.366
EQUIVALENT OF A GIGANTIC

25:39.433 --> 25:40.933
MORTGAGE TO GO TO ONE OF THESE

25:41.000 --> 25:42.066
SCHOOLS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO

25:42.133 --> 25:44.266
GET UP TO COLLEGE NOW THEY LEAVE

25:44.333 --> 25:45.666
AND THEY THINK TO THEMSELVES I

25:45.733 --> 25:46.800
COULD HAVE JUST WAITED TABLES

25:46.866 --> 25:48.366
FROM THE BEGINNING AND NOT HAD

25:48.433 --> 25:49.933
THIS MASSIVE DEBT WHEN I LEFT.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.233
PEOPLE ARE CATCHING ON TO THAT

25:52.300 --> 25:54.933
AND THAT'S A PROBLEM.

25:55.000 --> 25:59.933
>> AT RE "REASON" MAGAZINE WE ME

26:00.000 --> 26:01.166
A POINT TO HIRE PEOPLE WHO DON'T

26:01.233 --> 26:02.433
HAVE COLLEGE DEGREES, THAT'S

26:02.500 --> 26:03.666
BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T GET IT

26:03.733 --> 26:04.433
TOGETHER TO FINISH COLLEGE

26:04.500 --> 26:06.733
RATHER THAN A DEEP PRINCIPLED

26:06.800 --> 26:07.600
POSITION.

26:07.666 --> 26:10.066
IT'S FOR THIS VERY REASON,

26:10.133 --> 26:11.466
THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT SPENDING

26:11.533 --> 26:12.933
FOUR YEARS ON AN IVY-COVERED

26:13.000 --> 26:14.766
CAMPUS OR IN A STRIP MALL AS IN

26:14.833 --> 26:17.500
THE CASE OF MANY COLLEGES IN

26:17.566 --> 26:18.466
AMERICA THAT MAKES YOU BETTER

26:18.533 --> 26:22.100
QUALIFIED TO DO A LOT OF JOBS.

26:22.166 --> 26:23.966
I THINK THE AMERICAN PUBLIC

26:24.033 --> 26:26.866
CURRENTLY HOLDS SOMETHING LIKE

26:26.933 --> 26:28.900
1.6 TRILLION -- ONCE WE ARE IN,

26:28.966 --> 26:30.266
WE WILL ROUNDED UP OR DOWN,

26:30.333 --> 26:31.466
MONEY DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING

26:31.533 --> 26:33.333
ANYMORE, THEY HOLD $1.6 TRILLION

26:33.400 --> 26:35.733
IN FEDERAL STUDENT DEBT.

26:35.800 --> 26:39.233
THAT MONEY MAYBE DOESN'T MEAN

26:39.300 --> 26:40.133
ANYTHING TO THE FEDERAL

26:40.200 --> 26:41.266
GOVERNMENT BUT IT MEANS A LOT TO

26:41.333 --> 26:42.333
THOSE INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE, THEY

26:42.400 --> 26:43.666
HAVE BEEN SOLD THIS BILL OF

26:43.733 --> 26:46.300
GOODS WHERE THEY HAVE TAKEN ON

26:46.366 --> 26:46.866
DEBT, IT'S SHAPING DECISIONS

26:46.933 --> 26:49.166
THEY MAKE IN THEIR LIVES AND

26:49.233 --> 26:51.366
WRINKLY, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US

26:51.433 --> 26:53.100
IMPROVE OUR K-12 SYSTEM SO

26:53.166 --> 26:54.300
PEOPLE DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY NEED

26:54.366 --> 26:58.633
A COLLEGE DEGREE.

26:58.700 --> 27:01.666
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

27:01.733 --> 27:04.900
MASSIVELY INCREASED SPENDING TO

27:04.966 --> 27:05.600
NO AVAIL.

27:05.666 --> 27:06.900
>> Bill: I FEEL LIKE THEY

27:06.966 --> 27:07.466
DON'T KNOW ANYTHING, THEY'VE

27:07.533 --> 27:09.533
NEVER READ A BOOK.

27:09.600 --> 27:12.033
SOMEBODY SENT ME A VIDEO OF A

27:12.100 --> 27:16.333
TIKTOK MASHUP, IT'S LIKE THE OLD

27:16.400 --> 27:18.333
JAYWALKING BIT WHERE HE ASKED

27:18.400 --> 27:19.433
PEOPLE QUESTIONS.

27:19.500 --> 27:20.566
FIRST QUESTION, WHO WAS THE

27:20.633 --> 27:28.266
FIRST AMERICAN TO WALK ON THE

27:28.333 --> 27:28.433
SON.

27:28.500 --> 27:34.466
HIM AND GO LANCE ARMSTRONG?

27:34.533 --> 27:35.033
ANOTHER QUESTION IS VENICE,

27:35.100 --> 27:39.500
ITALY, IS AND WHAT COUNTRY.

27:39.566 --> 27:42.433
ANSWER: PARIS.

27:42.500 --> 27:44.200
THEY ARE MORONIC ON A LEVEL THEY

27:44.266 --> 27:45.600
WEREN'T EVEN TEN YEARS AGO.

27:45.666 --> 27:46.500
WHY WOULD I WANT TO PUT MORE

27:46.566 --> 27:51.266
MONEY INTO THAT?

27:51.333 --> 27:52.666
ONE OF THEM PREFACES HER ANSWER

27:52.733 --> 27:53.300
WITH I'M A TEACHER, I SHOULD

27:53.366 --> 27:55.633
KNOW THIS.

27:55.700 --> 27:58.766
AND NOW WE ARE FINDING OUT,

27:58.833 --> 27:59.433
SOMEBODY IDENTIFIED THIS WEEK I

27:59.500 --> 28:02.500
SAW ON THE NEWS WITH THEIR

28:02.566 --> 28:04.000
CALLING A MEETING CRISIS BECAUSE

28:04.066 --> 28:07.066
WOMEN OVERWHELMINGLY ARE KICKING

28:07.133 --> 28:11.100
ENDS ASSES AS FAR AS GETTING

28:11.166 --> 28:13.600
DEGREES.

28:13.666 --> 28:14.100
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

28:14.166 --> 28:17.500
THAT'S WHAT I THINK!

28:17.566 --> 28:19.866
>> I THINK MEN MIGHT BE ONTO

28:19.933 --> 28:21.266
SOMETHING HERE.

28:21.333 --> 28:23.100
IT PAINS ME BUT IT SIGNIFICANTLY

28:23.166 --> 28:24.766
FEWER MEN ARE LOOKING AT THE

28:24.833 --> 28:25.400
PROPOSITION THAT COLLEGE OFFERS

28:25.466 --> 28:29.433
AND SAYING THEY WANT TO TAKE IT,

28:29.500 --> 28:31.700
YOU KNOW -- I HATE TO SAY THAT.

28:31.766 --> 28:33.466
>> Bill: THE PROBLEM IS THAT

28:33.533 --> 28:35.233
WOMEN WHO HAVE A DEGREE DON'T

28:35.300 --> 28:37.500
WANT TO GO OUT WITH MEN WHO

28:37.566 --> 28:37.700
DON'T.

28:37.766 --> 28:39.533
YOU WIND UP WITH ALL THESE

28:39.600 --> 28:44.800
LONELY, ANGRY MEN.

28:44.866 --> 28:45.666
[LAUGHTER]

28:45.733 --> 28:48.400
REALLY FUNNY!

28:48.466 --> 28:50.366
WHO ARE GOING TO BURN DOWN THE

28:50.433 --> 28:50.600
COUNTRY.

28:50.666 --> 28:53.300
OTHER THAN THAT, IT'S HYSTERICA

28:53.366 --> 28:54.066
HYSTERICAL.

28:54.133 --> 28:56.200
WHEREVER YOU HAVE LONELY, ANGRY

28:56.266 --> 28:57.666
MEN, IT'S NEVER A GOOD THING.

28:57.733 --> 29:01.033
THE PRIESTHOOD.

29:01.100 --> 29:01.566
FOR THE TALIBAN.

29:01.633 --> 29:03.933
I COULD GO ON.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.700
LONELY, ANGRY MEN.

29:07.766 --> 29:09.433
WHO WAS THE PERFECT CHAMPION OF

29:09.500 --> 29:12.166
THE MORONIC?

29:12.233 --> 29:14.666
DONALD TRUMP.

29:14.733 --> 29:15.966
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

29:16.033 --> 29:16.500
ESPECIALLY GUYS.

29:16.566 --> 29:17.800
HIS VOCABULARY, ALL SIX WORDS OF

29:17.866 --> 29:22.533
IT IS PERFECT.

29:22.600 --> 29:26.066
>> I COVERED TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND

29:26.133 --> 29:27.766
HE KNEW EXACTLY WHO HE WAS

29:27.833 --> 29:29.566
TALKING TO, HIS WHOLE THING

29:29.633 --> 29:32.100
ABOUT "I LOVE THE POORLY

29:32.166 --> 29:32.866
EDUCATED."

29:32.933 --> 29:34.066
HE UNDERSTOOD WHERE ALL THE

29:34.133 --> 29:36.900
FRUSTRATION WAS OUT THERE,

29:36.966 --> 29:37.866
EDUCATION IS THE POLITICAL

29:37.933 --> 29:38.866
DIVIDE IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT

29:38.933 --> 29:39.300
NOW.

29:39.366 --> 29:40.833
IT'S THE MOST PREDICTIVE THING,

29:40.900 --> 29:42.466
IF YOU WANT TO DETERMINE WHO'S

29:42.533 --> 29:43.666
GOING TO VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS AND

29:43.733 --> 29:45.666
WHO'S GOING TO VOTE FOR

29:45.733 --> 29:46.800
REPUBLICANS, IT'S COLLEGE

29:46.866 --> 29:47.500
GRADUATES VERSUS PEOPLE WHO

29:47.566 --> 29:50.633
DON'T HAVE COLLEGE DEGREES.

29:50.700 --> 29:52.400
THAT HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY

29:52.466 --> 29:53.166
SINCE CLINTON'S TIME.

29:53.233 --> 29:55.566
IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOP 30

29:55.633 --> 29:57.633
DISTRICTS IN 1992, HALF OF THEM

29:57.700 --> 29:59.400
VOTED REPUBLICAN AND HALF OF

29:59.466 --> 30:00.266
THEM VOTED DEMOCRATS.

30:00.333 --> 30:02.100
IN THE LAST ELECTION, ALL BUT

30:02.166 --> 30:06.200
THREE OF THEM VOTED DEMOCRATS.

30:06.266 --> 30:09.233
IT'S BECOME A CLASS EDUCATIONAL

30:09.300 --> 30:09.433
THING.

30:09.500 --> 30:11.466
>> Bill: ACCOMPANIED BY REAL

30:11.533 --> 30:11.666
HATE.

30:11.733 --> 30:14.300
LIKE I WANT YOU TO DIE KIND OF

30:14.366 --> 30:14.500
HATE.

30:14.566 --> 30:18.566
WHICH NEVER WAS THE CASE.

30:18.633 --> 30:21.833
AS RECENTLY AS THE 20s OR

30:21.900 --> 30:24.766
30s, I THINK ONLY LIKE

30:24.833 --> 30:26.400
1 OUT OF 20 AMERICANS WENT TO

30:26.466 --> 30:26.633
COLLEGE.

30:26.700 --> 30:30.766
USED TO SAY "A COLLEGE MAN.

30:30.833 --> 30:31.866
"ALMOST LIKE YOU'RE A DOCTOR.

30:31.933 --> 30:33.666
BUT THE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T GO

30:33.733 --> 30:35.466
DIDN'T HATE THOSE PEOPLE, NOW

30:35.533 --> 30:35.900
THEY HATE.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.800
AND I SEE IN THE PAPER TODAY,

30:37.866 --> 30:42.433
OVER HALF OF TRUMP PEOPLE WANT A

30:42.500 --> 30:43.933
CIVIL WAR.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.666
41% OF BIDEN VOTERS WANT A

30:46.733 --> 30:47.533
CIVIL WAR, WHERE DO THEY THINK

30:47.600 --> 30:50.400
ARE GOING?

30:50.466 --> 30:51.833
WHAT SIDE ARE WE ON?

30:51.900 --> 30:55.333
I'M IN CALIFORNIA, HE GOT

30:55.400 --> 30:57.666
4.5 MILLION VOTES IN THIS STATE

30:57.733 --> 31:01.200
OR COWE CAN'T A CIVIL WAR.

31:01.266 --> 31:04.066
>> THIS IS THE PROBLEM OF

31:04.133 --> 31:05.566
POLARIZATION, IT CAUSES ALL

31:05.633 --> 31:07.566
KINDS OF DOWNSTREAM ISSUES, I

31:07.633 --> 31:08.100
GUESS INCLUDING EVENTUALLY

31:08.166 --> 31:11.233
CIVIL WAR, I HOPE NOT.

31:11.300 --> 31:14.066
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW PEOPLE WHO

31:14.133 --> 31:15.900
DISAGREE WITH THEM POLITICALLY

31:15.966 --> 31:17.733
ANYMORE AND THEY DID USE TO

31:17.800 --> 31:18.100
QUITE RECENTLY.

31:18.166 --> 31:21.666
>> Bill: EXACTLY.

31:21.733 --> 31:23.900
>> IN SOME WAYS, THAT'S A

31:23.966 --> 31:25.333
POTENTIAL SOLUTION TO SOME OF

31:25.400 --> 31:26.700
THE ANGST AROUND POLITICS RIGHT

31:26.766 --> 31:28.300
NOW, IT'S IF EVERYONE COULD JUST

31:28.366 --> 31:30.366
GO MAKE ONE FRIEND WHO VOTED

31:30.433 --> 31:32.700
DIFFERENTLY -- I GET IT TO.

31:32.766 --> 31:33.566
IF YOU'RE REPUBLICAN AND YOU

31:33.633 --> 31:37.833
THINK A DEMOCRAT IS TOO FAR AND

31:37.900 --> 31:38.800
VICE VERSA, CONSIDER

31:38.866 --> 31:39.566
LIBERTARIANS.

31:39.633 --> 31:40.766
THERE'S SOMETHING TO HATE AND

31:40.833 --> 31:43.333
SOMETHING TO LOVE FOR BOTH SIDES

31:43.400 --> 31:44.666
ABOUT US.

31:44.733 --> 31:46.433
AND WE ARE SUPER FUN AT PARTIES.

31:46.500 --> 31:50.133
JUST TRY IT.

31:50.200 --> 31:50.400
[LAUGHTER]

31:50.466 --> 31:52.100

31:52.166 --> 31:53.800

BE A GOOD WEEK WITH THE

31:55.233 --> 31:56.200
STEPHANIE GRISHAM BOOK COMING

31:56.266 --> 31:58.066

31:59.333 --> 32:00.566
DON'T KNOW IT FOR A FACT, I JUST

32:17.566 --> 32:18.333
EVERY GUY WHO CAN'T GET IT UP

32:18.400 --> 32:21.266
WILL BLAME IT ON LONG COVID, I

32:21.333 --> 32:25.900
JUST KNOW IT'S TRUE.

WOULD JUST GO.'SHIT, NOW I HAVE

34:10.366 --> 34:11.066
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

34:11.133 --> 34:12.866
I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD

34:12.933 --> 34:13.466
WEEK TO DO THIS BECAUSE WHEN I

34:13.533 --> 34:17.066
READ YOU, MATT TAIBBI, AS I

34:17.133 --> 34:18.333
ALWAYS DO ABOUT RUSSIA, THAT

34:18.400 --> 34:20.633
SEEMS TO BE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,

34:20.700 --> 34:21.666
THE RUSSIA-TRUMP CONNECTION.

34:21.733 --> 34:24.733
YOU GET WHAT I'M SAYING?

34:24.800 --> 34:26.466
THAT IS YOUR THESIS IS THAT THE

34:26.533 --> 34:27.866
MEDIA IS LIKE I DON'T KNOW FOR A

34:27.933 --> 34:29.733
FACT, I JUST KNOW IT'S TRUE.

34:29.800 --> 34:31.833
I HAVE TO PICK THIS FIGHT WITH

34:31.900 --> 34:33.266
YOU BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND --

34:33.333 --> 34:34.600
YOU'RE RIGHT, THE MEDIA DOESN'T

34:34.666 --> 34:36.700
LEAP ON THINGS TOO SOON.

34:36.766 --> 34:38.666
THEY DON'T CARE, THEY WANT TO BE

34:38.733 --> 34:41.300
FIRST, MORE IMPORTANT THAN BEING

34:41.366 --> 34:41.566
ACCURATE.

34:41.633 --> 34:44.466
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU THINK THAT

34:44.533 --> 34:46.733
WHEN TRUMP SAYS IT WAS A HOAX,

34:46.800 --> 34:47.800
HE'S RIGHT AND I DON'T THINK

34:47.866 --> 34:50.866
THAT'S THE CASE.

34:50.933 --> 34:53.166
YOU COMPARED IT TO WMDs, IT

34:53.233 --> 34:54.066
SAID THE RUSSIA CONNECTION WITH

34:54.133 --> 34:57.100
TRUMP IS THIS GENERATION WMD

34:57.166 --> 34:59.400
COME I DON'T THINK THAT'S AN

34:59.466 --> 35:01.166
ACCURATE ANALOGY, THERE WERE NO

35:01.233 --> 35:02.466
WMDs BUT THERE WAS COLLUSION

35:02.533 --> 35:04.500
WITH RUSSIA.

35:04.566 --> 35:06.866
>> REALLY?

35:06.933 --> 35:07.333
WHERE?

35:07.400 --> 35:09.300
>> Bill: THE SENATE

35:09.366 --> 35:10.066
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, THIS IS

35:10.133 --> 35:13.900
RUN BY REPUBLICANS WHO ARE IF

35:13.966 --> 35:16.200
ANYTHING ARE SLAVISH TO TRUMP,

35:16.266 --> 35:17.500
THEIR REPORTS AT TRUMP

35:17.566 --> 35:18.900
CAMPAIGN'S INTERACTIONS WITH

35:20.700 --> 35:23.033
DURING THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL

35:23.100 --> 35:25.000
ELECTION POSED A GRAVE

35:25.066 --> 35:26.000
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE THREAT.

35:26.066 --> 35:26.900
WHY WOULD REPUBLICANS SAY THAT

35:26.966 --> 35:29.100
ABOUT DONALD TRUMP?

35:29.166 --> 35:31.100
>> FIRST OF ALL, ROBERT MUELLER

35:31.166 --> 35:34.166
DIDN'T SAY THAT'S.

35:34.233 --> 35:36.033
>> Bill: HE DIDN'T NOT SAY

35:36.100 --> 35:36.766
THAT.

35:36.833 --> 35:39.266
HE SAID I'M NOT GOING TO NOT NOT

35:39.333 --> 35:44.300
NOT SAY -- HE PUSSIED OUT BUT HE

35:44.366 --> 35:46.033
DIDN'T EXONERATE HIM AT ALL.

35:46.100 --> 35:49.200
>> THIS STORY IS ABOUT THE

35:49.266 --> 35:51.400
ALLEGED DELIVERY OF PUBLIC

35:51.466 --> 35:54.433
POLLING DATA TO A GUY WITH THE

INTERNATIONAL REPUBLICAN

35:55.033 --> 35:55.400

35:55.466 --> 35:57.600
>> Bill: HE'S ALSO BEEN

35:57.666 --> 35:58.366
DESCRIBED AS A GRU AGENT.

35:58.433 --> 36:00.866
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW, HE'S

36:00.933 --> 36:01.533
CERTAINLY SOMETHING CLOSE TO THE

36:01.600 --> 36:04.466
PEOPLE IN RUSSIA -- YOU WILL

36:04.533 --> 36:07.200
ADMIT THEY HAD A BUILDING OF

36:07.266 --> 36:08.733
PEOPLE IN ST. PETERSBURG WHO

36:08.800 --> 36:10.666
WERE JUST ASSIGNED TO RAT FUCK

36:10.733 --> 36:12.966
THE ELECTION THROUGH FACEBOOK,

36:13.033 --> 36:13.466
RIGHT?

36:13.533 --> 36:14.800
>> Bill: THEORETICALLY, THEY

36:14.866 --> 36:16.100
TALKED ABOUT $100,000 THAT WAS

36:16.166 --> 36:19.600
SPENT BY THAT COMPANY.

36:19.666 --> 36:20.566
>> Bill: FACEBOOK IS FREE.

36:20.633 --> 36:22.266
>> BUT THEY NEVER ESTABLISHED A

36:22.333 --> 36:22.900
CONNECTION BETWEEN THAT COMPANY

36:22.966 --> 36:26.600
AND THE GOVERNMENT.

36:26.666 --> 36:27.900
>> Bill: THEY WERE JUST DOING

36:27.966 --> 36:28.433
IT VOLUNTARILY?

36:28.500 --> 36:31.400
>> $100,000 WITH OF ADS?

36:31.466 --> 36:33.033
IF THEY REALLY WANTED TO AFFECT

36:33.100 --> 36:36.766
THE ELECTION, WHY NOT JUST GIVE

36:36.833 --> 36:37.166
TRUMP $50 MILLION.

36:37.233 --> 36:40.233
>> Bill: 9/11 DIDN'T COST

36:40.300 --> 36:42.000
MUCH EITHER, IT'S NOT ABOUT HOW

36:42.066 --> 36:42.566
MUCH YOU SPEND.

36:42.633 --> 36:44.466
>> I THINK THE MORE SIGNIFICANT

36:44.533 --> 36:46.200
THING IS THERE WAS SUCH A

36:46.266 --> 36:46.866
MASSIVE QUANTITY OF FAKE STORIES

36:46.933 --> 36:50.700
THAT DID GO THROUGH.

36:50.766 --> 36:55.366
>> Bill: THE DOSSIER GOT RIGHT

36:55.433 --> 36:55.933
TO GO VERY IMPORTANT THINGS.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.666
I THOUGHT YOU LOOKED AT ME

36:58.733 --> 36:59.000
LIKE --

36:59.066 --> 37:00.833
>> THAT'S MY DEFAULT FACIAL

37:00.900 --> 37:06.566
EXPRESSION, SKEPTICISM.

37:06.633 --> 37:09.233
>> Bill: THEY GOT RIGHTS THAT

37:09.300 --> 37:10.600
HE WAS WAGING A BROAD CAMPAIGN

37:10.666 --> 37:12.000
TO ELECT TRUMP AND THE OTHER

37:12.066 --> 37:14.166
THING THEY GOT RIGHT WAS THE

37:14.233 --> 37:17.633
WIKILEAKS LEAK.

37:17.700 --> 37:19.133
>> THIS WAS ALL BEING WRITTEN

37:19.200 --> 37:20.466
DURING THE TIME ALL OF THIS WAS

37:20.533 --> 37:22.433
COMING OUT TO.

37:22.500 --> 37:23.433
THE FBI CONCLUDED THEY COULDN'T

37:23.500 --> 37:26.700
FIND ANY ORIGINAL REPORTING IN

37:26.766 --> 37:27.466
THE STEELE DOSSIER THAT ACTUALLY

37:27.533 --> 37:30.100
PANNED OUT.

37:30.166 --> 37:32.466
THE STUFF THAT WAS ORIGINAL IN

37:32.533 --> 37:34.433
THE STEELE DOSSIER, EVERYTHING

37:34.500 --> 37:34.933
FROM THE PEE TAPE TO THE

37:35.000 --> 37:39.566
WELL-DEVELOPED CONSPIRACY, THE

37:39.633 --> 37:41.966
PLAN BETWEEN THE FSB AND TRUMP,

37:42.033 --> 37:43.133
NONE OF THAT HAND OUT.

37:43.200 --> 37:45.033
>> Bill: THE PEE TAPE WAS A

37:45.100 --> 37:45.266
TRAGEDY.

37:45.333 --> 37:47.700
>> THAT WAS A MASSIVE STORY FOR

37:47.766 --> 37:47.900
YEARS.

37:47.966 --> 37:50.433
>> Bill: IT WAS A MASSIVE

37:50.500 --> 37:51.200
STORY BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD

37:51.266 --> 37:55.133
RATHER TALK ABOUT PEE THAN THE

37:55.200 --> 37:55.366
BUDGET.

37:55.433 --> 37:57.000
ON MOST SHOWS.

37:57.066 --> 37:59.933
WE TALK ABOUT BOTH.

38:00.000 --> 38:00.200
[LAUGHTER]

38:00.266 --> 38:00.466
[APPLAUSE]

38:00.533 --> 38:04.200
BUT THAT WAS CONFIRMED BY ROBERT

38:04.266 --> 38:07.066
MUELLER.

38:07.133 --> 38:08.233
ROGER STONE TOLD WIKILEAKS TO

38:08.300 --> 38:10.600
RELEASE THE DEMOCRATIC EMAILS,

38:10.666 --> 38:13.133
THE PODESTA EMAILS RIGHT AFTER

38:13.200 --> 38:14.333
THE HOLLYWOOD ACCESS TAPE CAME

38:14.400 --> 38:16.866
OUT AND THEY DID IT WITHIN AN

38:16.933 --> 38:17.066
HOUR.

38:17.133 --> 38:20.666
WITHIN A DAY AFTER TRUMP SAID

38:20.733 --> 38:21.666
PUBLICLY "RUSSIA, IF YOU'RE

38:21.733 --> 38:23.766
LISTENING, I HOPE YOU CAN HACK

38:23.833 --> 38:24.133
THOSE EMAILS.

38:24.200 --> 38:25.833
"THEY STARTED TO DO IT.

38:25.900 --> 38:29.500
THAT'S NOT COLLUSION?

38:29.566 --> 38:32.433
>> NO, THE ROGER STONE

38:32.500 --> 38:33.133
INDICTMENT PROVES THAT THE

38:33.200 --> 38:36.566
COLLUSION THEORY WAS WRONG.

38:36.633 --> 38:38.466
EVEN AT THAT VERY LATE DATE THEY

38:38.533 --> 38:40.166
WERE TRYING TO REACH OUT TO

38:40.233 --> 38:40.733
WIKILEAKS.

38:40.800 --> 38:42.966
IF THERE WAS A CONSPIRACY

38:43.033 --> 38:45.400
BETWEEN WIKILEAKS, RUSSIA,

38:45.466 --> 38:46.900
TRUMP, THEY WOULD'VE HAD

38:46.966 --> 38:47.633
ROGER STONE REACH OUT AND BEING

38:47.700 --> 38:51.066
TOLD TO FUCK OFF.

38:51.133 --> 38:52.600
>> Bill: SO IT'S A COINCIDENCE

38:52.666 --> 38:53.933
THE EMAILS WERE RELEASED RIGHT

38:54.000 --> 38:54.133
AFTER?

38:54.200 --> 38:56.800
>> THAT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

38:56.866 --> 38:58.733
THING FROM TALKING ABOUT AN

38:58.800 --> 38:59.966
ESPIONAGE CONSPIRACY WHERE TRUMP

39:00.033 --> 39:03.633
AND THE RUSSIANS GOT TOGETHER TO

39:03.700 --> 39:04.533
PLAN TO FIX AN ELECTION.

39:04.600 --> 39:08.200
THEY ARE ALLOWED TO TALK TO

39:08.266 --> 39:09.133
WIKILEAKS IF THEY THINK THEY

39:09.200 --> 39:09.933
HAVE A BIG STORY THAT'S GOING TO

39:10.000 --> 39:11.800
HURT HILLARY CLINTON.

39:11.866 --> 39:12.400
>> Bill: YOU WANT TO JUMP IN

39:12.466 --> 39:14.400
ON THIS?

39:14.466 --> 39:17.266
>> I WOULD NOT LOVE TO, FRANKLY,

39:17.333 --> 39:17.666
BUT I WILL.

39:17.733 --> 39:19.666
HIM AND I FEEL LIKE I'M AT A

39:19.733 --> 39:21.466
TABLE WITH TWO DUDES WHO EACH

39:21.533 --> 39:23.333
HAVE THEIR OWN BULLETIN BOARD

39:23.400 --> 39:27.266
COVERED WITH YARN AND NEWS

39:27.333 --> 39:29.666
CLIPPINGS AND YOU'RE BOTH RIGHT.

39:29.733 --> 39:35.066
THERE REALLY IS -- THIS LIVES IN

39:35.133 --> 39:36.300
THE SPACE BETWEEN INCOMPETENCE

39:36.366 --> 39:36.866
AND CONSPIRACY.

39:36.933 --> 39:38.400
TRUMP DID A TERRIBLE JOB OF

39:38.466 --> 39:40.466
COLLUDING WITH RUSSIA IF HE WAS

39:40.533 --> 39:41.233
TRYING TO.

39:41.300 --> 39:42.333
>> Bill: YES, RIGHT!

39:42.400 --> 39:43.933
>> AND MAYBE HE WAS TRYING TO

39:44.000 --> 39:46.633
PUT ON SOME LEVEL I THINK THE

39:46.700 --> 39:49.166
REAL MISTAKE WAS AND I THINK

39:49.233 --> 39:51.200
THIS IS MATT'S POINT, THE MEDIA

39:51.266 --> 39:54.966
FOCUS ON THIS STORY MISSED THE

39:55.033 --> 39:56.500
MARK BECAUSE TRUMP WAS DOING A

39:56.566 --> 39:59.100
BUNCH OF VERY BAD STUFF IN

39:59.166 --> 40:01.000
PUBLIC THAT CAN AND SHOULD HAVE

40:01.066 --> 40:01.633
CONVINCED PEOPLE THAT HE WASN'T

40:01.700 --> 40:06.533
GOING TO BE FIT TO SERVE AS

40:06.600 --> 40:09.700
PRESIDENT FOR A SECOND TERM, A

40:09.766 --> 40:11.866
FIRST TERM -- IT TURNED OUT THAT

40:11.933 --> 40:13.866
FOCUSING ON THE RUSSIA STUFF MAY

40:13.933 --> 40:16.233
BE DISTRACTED FROM TALKING ABOUT

40:16.300 --> 40:17.900
HIS TERRIBLE IMMIGRATION POLICY

40:17.966 --> 40:19.066
OR THE BUDGET.

40:19.133 --> 40:21.866
>> Bill: I FEEL LIKE WE DID

40:21.933 --> 40:23.633
BOTH.

40:23.700 --> 40:26.133
>> WE DIDN'T NEED THE PEE TAPE,

40:26.200 --> 40:27.233
WE HAD THE EXCESS HOLLYWOOD

40:27.300 --> 40:27.433
TAPE.

40:27.500 --> 40:28.300
>> Bill: TO PRETEND THEY

40:28.366 --> 40:29.366
WEREN'T IN BED WITH THE RUSSIANS

40:29.433 --> 40:30.600
AND THEN THEY DID IT AGAIN

40:30.666 --> 40:32.133
BECAUSE THEY GOT AWAY WITH IT.

40:32.200 --> 40:33.533
RUDY GIULIANI WENT TO UKRAINE

40:33.600 --> 40:35.500
AND MET WITH A GUY WHO HE SAID

40:35.566 --> 40:38.466
AT BEST THIS IS LIKE 50/50 A

40:38.533 --> 40:40.400
RUSSIAN AGENT, THAT WAS HIS

40:40.466 --> 40:40.633
DEFENSE.

40:40.700 --> 40:42.600
SHOULD WE EVEN BE MEETING WITH

40:42.666 --> 40:45.666
PEOPLE WHO ARE AT BEST 50/50 A

40:45.733 --> 40:46.533
RUSSIAN AGENT?

40:46.600 --> 40:47.733
THAT'S HOW FAR THE GOALPOSTS

40:47.800 --> 40:51.333
HAVE MOVED, THAT'S NOT A BIG.

40:51.400 --> 40:56.000
>> THE STORY FOR THREE YEARS WAS

40:56.066 --> 40:57.333
TRUMP COLLUDED WITH A RUSSIAN

40:57.400 --> 40:59.233
SECRET SERVICES TO FIX AN

40:59.300 --> 41:00.366
ELECTION, IT WAS AN ESPIONAGE

41:00.433 --> 41:02.666
CONSPIRACY STORY, THAT WE TOOK

41:02.733 --> 41:02.933
SERIOUSLY.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.733
>> Bill: BECAUSE IT IS

41:04.800 --> 41:05.366
SERIOUS, THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO BE

41:05.433 --> 41:06.166
IN THE SAME ROOM.

41:06.233 --> 41:09.233
THE THING IS WITH TRUMP HE

41:09.300 --> 41:10.800
COMMITTED HIS CRIMES SO PUBLICLY

41:10.866 --> 41:12.466
THAT PEOPLE JUST THOUGHT IT MUST

41:12.533 --> 41:13.666
NOT BE A CRIME BECAUSE HOW ELSE

41:13.733 --> 41:15.266
COULD YOU GET AWAY WITH THAT?

41:15.333 --> 41:18.233
IT'S LIKE THE GUY WHO CHEATS ON

41:18.300 --> 41:19.666
HIS WIFE RIGHT AT THE PRIME

41:19.733 --> 41:21.866
TABLE IN THE MOST POPULAR

41:21.933 --> 41:22.366
RESTAURANT.

41:22.433 --> 41:24.866
IF I WAS FUCKING HER WHAT I BE

41:24.933 --> 41:29.033
RIGHT HERE?

41:29.100 --> 41:29.633
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

41:29.700 --> 41:31.700
LET'S MOVE ON.

41:31.766 --> 41:36.033
BIG NEWS TODAY, MERCK HAS A NEW

41:36.100 --> 41:38.366
COVID PILL.

41:38.433 --> 41:41.000
WHAT IS FUNNY ABOUT THAT?

41:41.066 --> 41:41.366
[LAUGHTER]

41:41.433 --> 41:42.033
I WANT TO ASK IF YOU THINK THIS

41:42.100 --> 41:45.600
IS A GAME CHANGER BUT WE NEVER

41:45.666 --> 41:47.000
HAD THIS SO FAR.

41:47.066 --> 41:48.433
THEY HAVE DEVELOPED A PILL THAT

41:48.500 --> 41:49.866
REDUCES THE RISK OF

41:49.933 --> 41:51.400
HOSPITALIZATION OR DEATH BY

41:51.466 --> 41:54.233
ABOUT 50% FOR PATIENTS WITH THEY

41:54.300 --> 41:56.166
SAY MILD OR MODERATE CASES OF

41:56.233 --> 41:58.800
COVID WHICH MEANS TAKE IT EARLY,

41:58.866 --> 42:01.633
WHEN YOU FIRST FEEL BAD, TAKE

42:01.700 --> 42:03.266
THIS PILL -- IS THIS GOING TO

42:03.333 --> 42:05.333
CHANGE EVERYTHING?

42:05.400 --> 42:07.733
>> I SURE HOPE SO, IT WOULD BE

42:07.800 --> 42:09.833
INCREDIBLE IF THIS WORKED OUT,

42:09.900 --> 42:11.266
JUST LIKE THE VACCINE WAS AN

42:11.333 --> 42:13.600
INCREDIBLE INNOVATION THAT

42:13.666 --> 42:14.633
CHANGED -- UNFORTUNATELY NOT AS

42:14.700 --> 42:17.866
MUCH AS WE WOULD LIKE BUT ONLY

42:17.933 --> 42:18.366
HELPED GET THE COUNTRY

42:18.433 --> 42:19.000
FUNCTIONING AGAIN AND THE WORLD

42:19.066 --> 42:21.566
FUNCTIONING AGAIN.

42:21.633 --> 42:23.666
>> Bill: BUT THIS IS A PILL,

42:23.733 --> 42:25.633
PEOPLE LOVE PILLS, AMERICANS

42:25.700 --> 42:26.400
LOVE PILLS.

42:26.466 --> 42:27.800
THAT'S WHY I THINK THIS IS GOING

42:27.866 --> 42:29.666
TO BE THE GAME BECAUSE THEY ARE

42:29.733 --> 42:32.166
LIKE JUST SOLVE IT WITH A PILL.

42:32.233 --> 42:33.166
EVEN THOUGH A PILL COULD DO THE

42:33.233 --> 42:35.766
SAME AS A VACCINE.

42:35.833 --> 42:37.166
PEOPLE WANT PILLS.

42:37.233 --> 42:39.366
THEY LOVE PILLS, PILLS ARE EASY,

42:39.433 --> 42:41.300
EVEN A SHOT IT'S LIKE IT HURTS

42:41.366 --> 42:42.766
AND I DON'T KNOW, IT'S A SCARY,

42:42.833 --> 42:45.033
IT'S A NEEDLE, BUT A PILL, WHO

42:45.100 --> 42:47.100
CAN'T TAKE A PILL?

42:47.166 --> 42:49.000
>> I'M STARTING TO FEEL BAD I

42:49.066 --> 42:50.700
DIDN'T BRING YOU ANY PILLS, I'M

42:50.766 --> 42:51.866
VERY SORRY.

42:51.933 --> 42:52.200
I COULD HAVE.

42:52.266 --> 42:52.466
[LAUGHTER]

42:52.533 --> 42:54.833
[APPLAUSE]

42:54.900 --> 42:56.666
I THINK THIS IS AN ENCOURAGING

42:56.733 --> 42:58.200
DEVELOPMENT, IT COULD BE A

42:58.266 --> 42:58.900
GAME CHANGER.

42:58.966 --> 43:01.066
I WENT INTO THE PANDEMIC

43:01.133 --> 43:02.533
EXTREMELY SKEPTICAL OF THE FDA

43:02.600 --> 43:04.433
AND THE CDC BUT I THINK AMERICA

43:04.500 --> 43:06.433
JOINED ME IN THAT AS WE SAW A

43:06.500 --> 43:07.966
HUGE NUMBER OF MISTAKES BY THE

43:08.033 --> 43:10.633
PUBLIC HEALTH BUREAUCRACY, HUGE

43:10.700 --> 43:12.433
AND THIS PILL DOES NOT HAVE FDA

43:12.500 --> 43:14.133
APPROVAL RIGHT NOW.

43:14.200 --> 43:14.933
I WANT TO KNOW HOW LONG ARE WE

43:15.000 --> 43:17.233
GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT?

43:17.300 --> 43:18.933
IF THIS IS LIFE SAVING WHAT THE

43:19.000 --> 43:20.866
VACCINES HAVE TURNED OUT TO BE,

43:20.933 --> 43:22.433
I WOULD LIKE FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE

43:22.500 --> 43:24.566
THE RIGHT TO TRY THESE

43:24.633 --> 43:25.533
LIFE-SAVING MEDICATIONS AND I'M

43:25.600 --> 43:27.000
AFRAID THE BUREAUCRACY IS GOING

43:27.066 --> 43:28.033
TO STAND IN THE WAY.

43:28.100 --> 43:28.600
>> Bill: ONE OF THE PROBLEMS

43:28.666 --> 43:34.600
AS YOU HAVE WRITTEN ELOQUENTLY

43:34.666 --> 43:35.933
ABOUT, WE HAVE POLITICIZED

43:36.000 --> 43:37.800
MEDICATION.

43:37.866 --> 43:40.300
IVERMECTIN, IT'S A DRUG, IT'S

43:40.366 --> 43:42.566
NOT A POLITICIAN, IT SHOULD NOT

43:42.633 --> 43:43.766
HAVE ANY REPUTATION EXCEPT DOES

43:43.833 --> 43:45.200
IT WORK OR NOT?

43:45.266 --> 43:50.566
[APPLAUSE]

43:50.633 --> 43:51.533
THANK YOU FOR APPLAUDING THAT

43:51.600 --> 43:52.433
COMPLETELY NONCONTROVERSIAL

43:52.500 --> 43:52.633
IDEA.

43:52.700 --> 43:53.700
ON THE LEFT IT WAS LIKE YOU

43:53.766 --> 43:56.000
CAN'T EVEN MENTION IT TO.

43:56.066 --> 44:00.466
IS NOT PART OF YOUR CENSORED

44:00.533 --> 44:00.933
CAMPAIGN?

44:01.000 --> 44:04.066
PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT IVERMECTIN

44:04.133 --> 44:05.533
AND COMEDIANS ON THE LEFT WERE

44:05.600 --> 44:06.966
ONLY TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT

44:07.033 --> 44:11.600
IT WAS USED TO T -- LEAVING OUT

44:11.666 --> 44:13.233
THAT IT WAS MILLIONS OF TIMES

44:13.300 --> 44:14.400
FOR HUMANS.

44:14.466 --> 44:16.166
THERE WAS A LARGE PATIENT TO

44:16.233 --> 44:17.466
STUDY IN BRAZIL, IVERMECTIN THEY

44:17.533 --> 44:19.933

44:20.000 --> 44:22.600
YOU KNOW WHAT?

44:22.666 --> 44:24.033
THERE'S ALWAYS MULTIPLE STUDIES.

44:24.100 --> 44:25.833
I DON'T KNOW, DOCTORS ARE ALSO

44:25.900 --> 44:28.600
WRONG ABOUT SHIT.

44:28.666 --> 44:30.966
WE DON'T KNOW.

44:31.033 --> 44:33.800
SPEAK OF THE THAT IS WEIRD ABOUT

44:33.866 --> 44:35.466
COVID IS THERE SO MANY PEOPLE

44:35.533 --> 44:37.633
ROOTING AGAINST OR FOR CERTAIN

44:37.700 --> 44:39.166
DRUGS.

44:39.233 --> 44:39.966

44:51.000 --> 44:52.133
A 30% REDUCTION IN RISK OF

44:52.200 --> 44:53.066
HOSPITALIZATION, WHY DON'T WE

44:53.133 --> 44:54.333
HEAR ABOUT THAT?

44:54.400 --> 44:55.866
WHY ISN'T THAT APPROVED TO TALK

44:55.933 --> 44:56.100
ABOUT?

44:56.166 --> 45:01.966
I DON'T GET IT.

45:02.033 --> 45:02.633
HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE, TRUMP TOOK

45:02.700 --> 45:03.333
US, WHEN YOU TOUCH A BABY BIRD,

45:03.400 --> 45:06.466
IT WILL DIE BECAUSE THE MOTHER

45:06.533 --> 45:10.233
KNOWS A HUMAN TOUCHED IT.

45:10.300 --> 45:12.866
>> I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT

45:12.933 --> 45:13.533
TO BE GATEKEEPERS ON THIS, A LOT

45:13.600 --> 45:15.066
OF PEOPLE THOUGHT THE AMERICAN

45:15.133 --> 45:18.000
PUBLIC WAS TOO STUPID TO

45:18.066 --> 45:19.233
UNDERSTAND THERE MIGHT BE

45:19.300 --> 45:20.200
MULTIPLE DIFFERENT TREATMENTS

45:20.266 --> 45:21.366
END OF THE THINGS GOING ON AT

45:21.433 --> 45:23.200
ONCE AND THEY JUST HAD TO BE

45:23.266 --> 45:25.166
TOLD A VERY, VERY SIMPLE STORY

45:25.233 --> 45:26.366
THAT ONLY THE VACCINE IS GOOD

45:26.433 --> 45:28.533
AND THEY HAD TO TAKE A VACCINE.

45:28.600 --> 45:31.400
FAR BE IT FOR ME TO SAY THE

45:31.466 --> 45:33.266
AMERICAN PUBLIC IS NOT STUPID,

45:33.333 --> 45:34.566
THAT DOES HAPPEN.

45:34.633 --> 45:36.300
WHEN MISTAKES ARE THIS HIGH END

45:36.366 --> 45:37.766
IT REALLY IS ABOUT PROTECTING

45:37.833 --> 45:39.900
YOUR OWN LIFE, PEOPLE SHOULD BE

45:39.966 --> 45:41.066
ALLOWED TO MAKE THEIR OWN

45:41.133 --> 45:42.600
CHOICES AND IF THEY WANT TO READ

45:42.666 --> 45:43.866
A BUNCH OF BRAZILIAN STUDIES AND

45:43.933 --> 45:44.566
COME TO THEIR OWN CONCLUSION,

45:44.633 --> 45:49.400
THAT SHOULD BE ALL RIGHT.

45:49.466 --> 45:50.200
[APPLAUSE]

45:50.266 --> 45:50.766
>> Bill: THAT STUDY MAY TURN

45:50.833 --> 45:52.466
OUT TO BE TRUE BUT THEY USUALLY

45:52.533 --> 45:55.666
DO MULTIPLE STUDIES AND I DON'T

45:55.733 --> 45:56.433
KNOW HOW THE BRAZILIAN STUDIES

45:56.500 --> 45:57.866
ARE DONE, I DON'T KNOW WHO WROTE

45:57.933 --> 45:58.766
A CHECK, SOMETIMES THAT HAPPENS

45:58.833 --> 46:03.600
TO MAKE A STATIC AMOUNT.

46:03.666 --> 46:06.200
AS A DOCTOR I READ, SERIOUS

46:06.266 --> 46:07.566

BILLION YEARS HAVE TO ADMIT

[LAUGHTER]

48:52.766 --> 48:53.433
[APPLAUSE]

48:53.500 --> 48:54.800
IN RECENT WEEKS, THE COUNTRY HAS

BEEN TRANSFIXED WITH THE STORY

48:56.033 --> 48:57.333
OF A YOUNG WOMAN MURDERED WHILE

48:57.400 --> 48:59.000
TRAVELING IN A VAN WITH HER

48:59.066 --> 48:59.900
BOYFRIEND, AND WHILE TOO MUCH

48:59.966 --> 49:01.600
ATTENTION HAS ALREADY BEEN PAID,

49:01.666 --> 49:02.733
THIS CASE HAS TAUGHT ME A FEW

49:02.800 --> 49:04.066
THINGS.

49:04.133 --> 49:09.666
FIRST THAT NANCY GRACE IS STILL

49:09.733 --> 49:14.533

[LAUGHTER]

49:15.333 --> 49:15.866

49:15.933 --> 49:16.900

49:24.133 --> 49:27.033
VAN.

49:27.100 --> 49:29.333

49:29.400 --> 49:31.233
WHAT RETIREES DO -- THEY GET AN

[LAUGHTER]

49:54.866 --> 49:57.033
[APPLAUSE]

49:57.100 --> 49:57.766
BUT OF COURSE THE WHOLE POINT OF

50:29.000 --> 50:30.700

50:30.766 --> 50:31.600
WHEN WE USED TO ASK KIDS "WHAT

DO YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW

50:32.466 --> 50:33.300

THEY'D SAY "FIREFIGHTER,,

50:34.366 --> 50:36.333
""ASTRONAUT."

50:36.400 --> 50:37.500
NOW MOST 6-YEAR-OLDS WOULD

52:36.233 --> 52:37.066
SOMETHING THAT MAKES THEM

52:37.133 --> 52:38.900
FAMOUS.

52:38.966 --> 52:41.100
THAT WOULD INVOLVE THAT PESKY

52:41.166 --> 52:42.733
STEP OF DEVELOPING SOME SORT OF

52:42.800 --> 52:46.266
TALENT OR SKILL -- NO, GETTING

52:46.333 --> 52:47.266
FOLLOWERS, THAT IS THE

52:47.333 --> 52:49.266
ACHIEVEMENT.

52:49.333 --> 52:50.700
I'D SAY "TAKE A GOOD LONG LOOK

52:50.766 --> 52:51.766
AT YOURSELF," BUT PLAINLY THAT'S

52:51.833 --> 53:00.133
ALL YOU DO ALL DAY.

53:00.200 --> 53:00.400
[LAUGHTER]

53:00.466 --> 53:01.033
[APPLAUSE]

53:01.100 --> 53:03.700
WE SPENT DECADES DISMANTLING THE

53:03.766 --> 53:05.266
PATRIARCHAL NOTION THAT WOMEN

53:05.333 --> 53:05.933
SHOULD STAY HOME AND NOT WORK,

53:06.000 --> 53:07.300
AND THEN THE KARDASHIAN

53:07.366 --> 53:08.700
PHENOMENON HAPPENED AND NOW IT

53:08.766 --> 53:10.433
SEEMS LIKE MILLIONS WANT TO.

53:10.500 --> 53:15.333
UM, STAY HOME AND NOT WORK.

53:15.400 --> 53:16.566
THIS GENERATION'S FINANCIAL PLAN

53:16.633 --> 53:18.866
IS HITTING THE JACKPOT.

53:18.933 --> 53:20.133
GETTING PAID TO DO NOTHING IS

53:20.200 --> 53:21.833
THEIR HIGHEST GOAL.

53:21.900 --> 53:24.866
SO SPOILED BY PARENTS WHO TOLD

53:24.933 --> 53:27.500
THEM, "ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS DO

53:27.566 --> 53:29.633
YOU" THAT THEY THINK IT'S

53:29.700 --> 53:30.533
FASCINATING FOR US TO WATCH THEM

53:30.600 --> 53:35.300
ORDER EGGS AT A DINER.

53:35.366 --> 53:35.566
[LAUGHTER]

53:35.633 --> 53:36.733
BUT HOW LONG CAN WE GO ON

53:36.800 --> 53:37.900
SELLING EACH OTHER OUR LIFE

53:37.966 --> 53:38.900
STORIES AS THE BASIS FOR AN

53:38.966 --> 53:39.333
ECONOMY?

53:39.400 --> 53:42.600
IT DOESN'T FEEL SUSTAINABLE.

53:42.666 --> 53:43.966
YOU CAN'T ALL BE THE TRUMAN

53:44.033 --> 53:47.166

53:47.233 --> 53:48.733
MOST OF THE TIME WHAT THESE

53:48.800 --> 53:50.166
VLOGGERS ARE REPORTING ON IN

53:50.233 --> 53:51.100
THEIR TRAVELS IS JUST

53:51.166 --> 53:53.100
THEMSELVES.

53:53.166 --> 54:00.733
"THIS JUST IN WE WOKE UP."

54:00.800 --> 54:01.000
[LAUGHTER]

54:01.066 --> 54:01.733
IT'S HARD TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND

54:01.800 --> 54:03.033

54:03.100 --> 54:04.733
MANY PEOPLE TRYING TO MAKE A

54:04.800 --> 54:05.666
LIVING BY TAKING PICTURES OF

54:05.733 --> 54:06.833
THEMSELVES, LIKE THEY'RE THEIR

54:06.900 --> 54:09.733
OWN PAPARAZZI.

54:09.800 --> 54:10.966
EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT WENT

54:11.033 --> 54:12.533
ON IN THAT VAN BETWEEN BRIAN AND

54:12.600 --> 54:13.600
GABBY; I WANT TO KNOW WHY

54:13.666 --> 54:15.066
FILMING "VAN LIFE" IS SOMETHING

54:15.133 --> 54:16.666
ANYONE WOULD FIND INTERESTING TO

54:16.733 --> 54:25.800
BEGIN WITH.

INTERESTING -- THAT'S AS TRUE IN

54:32.133 --> 54:33.466
THE YOUTUBE ERA AS IT WAS BACK

54:33.533 --> 54:35.033
WHEN KIDS HAD TO SIT THROUGH

54:35.100 --> 54:36.333
UNCLE MORTY'S SUPER 8 FOOTAGE OF

54:36.400 --> 54:41.200
HIS TRIP TO CYPRESS GARDENS, BUT

54:41.266 --> 54:41.466
[LAUGHTER]

54:41.533 --> 54:42.333
AT LEAST HE DIDN'T ASK US TO HIT

54:42.400 --> 54:43.066
THE "LIKE" BUTTON AND

54:43.133 --> 54:46.566
"SUBSCRIBE" TO IT.

54:46.633 --> 54:46.833
[LAUGHTER]

54:46.900 --> 54:47.800
I'M SORRY, BUT BRIAN LAUNDRIE

54:47.866 --> 54:48.933
WAS NOT AN INTERESTING PERSON

54:49.000 --> 54:49.900
UNTIL HE BECAME A PERSON OF

54:49.966 --> 54:58.066
INTEREST.

[LAUGHTER]

55:00.333 --> 55:00.733
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

55:00.800 --> 55:01.566
WHEN I READ ABOUT THIS COUPLE

55:01.633 --> 55:03.133
RIDING AROUND FOR FOUR MONTHS, I

55:03.200 --> 55:04.766
THOUGHT, HOW LOVELY THAT WOULD

55:04.833 --> 55:05.700
HAVE BEEN WHEN I WAS 22 -- I

55:05.766 --> 55:08.666
DON'T REMEMBER HAVING THE

55:08.733 --> 55:10.266
FREEDOM TO JUST DRIVE AROUND THE

55:10.333 --> 55:20.000
COUNTRY -- I HAD TO SELL DRUGS.

55:22.933 --> 55:26.066
I HAD TO PAY FOR IT.

55:26.133 --> 55:27.000
NOBODY THESE DAYS SEEMS TO BE UP

55:27.066 --> 55:28.066
FOR ENDURING THOSE EARLY, SHITTY

55:28.133 --> 55:28.733
JOBS AND SHITTY APARTMENTS WE

55:28.800 --> 55:29.766
ALL HAD AS A MATTER OF COURSE ON

55:29.833 --> 55:31.700
THE WAY TO SOMETHING BETTER.

55:31.766 --> 55:33.133
ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR GAMES OF

55:33.200 --> 55:34.533
THE PANDEMIC WAS NINTENDO'S

55:34.600 --> 55:36.400
ANIMAL CROSSING.

55:36.466 --> 55:37.466
A GAME WHERE YOU DON'T DO

55:37.533 --> 55:38.666
ANYTHING.

55:38.733 --> 55:40.000
THERE ARE NO BAD GUYS.

55:40.066 --> 55:41.200
YOU CAN'T DIE.

55:41.266 --> 55:42.466
YOU CAN'T WIN OR LOSE.

55:42.533 --> 55:47.733
YOU JUST KIND OF FUCK AROUND.

55:48.066 --> 55:48.933
WHAT A PERFECT GAME FOR THIS

55:49.000 --> 55:49.900
GENERATION.

55:49.966 --> 55:51.500
BUT WHAT I DON'T GET ABOUT THEM,

55:51.566 --> 55:53.566
IS: IF YOU THINK HAVING A JOB IS

55:53.633 --> 55:54.766
SO TERRIBLE, HOW COME YOU'RE

55:54.833 --> 55:55.733
ALWAYS TRYING TO GET PEOPLE

55:55.800 --> 55:57.833
FIRED?

55:57.900 --> 55:58.933
OKAY, THAT'S OUR SHOW.
