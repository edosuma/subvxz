00:01.300 --> 00:04.975
<i>I attended Mr. Delaney's
funeral and a ghost appeared,</i>

00:05.100 --> 00:07.775
<i>a son we all thought
dead in Africa.</i>

00:07.900 --> 00:09.425
James Keziah Delaney.

00:09.550 --> 00:11.775
Dear Lord Almighty,
is that your brother?

00:11.900 --> 00:13.725
Your father was poisoned.

00:13.850 --> 00:16.450
I would say heavy doses
over a short period.

00:16.575 --> 00:20.725
One thing Africa did not cure is
that I still love you.

00:20.850 --> 00:21.925
<i>Now he is returned</i>

00:22.050 --> 00:25.425
<i>and Delaney's will leaves him
everything, including Nootka.</i>

00:25.550 --> 00:28.975
Britain and the United States
are currently at war.

00:29.100 --> 00:31.775
Sell this land
for a reasonable price.

00:31.900 --> 00:33.575
Nootka Sound is not for sale.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.775
I can give you whatever you like...
boys, girls.

00:36.900 --> 00:38.300
You have two hours to get out.

00:38.425 --> 00:41.025
I know things about the dead.

00:41.150 --> 00:43.775
I'd hoped to settle this matter
in a modern way,

00:43.900 --> 00:46.850
but that is not going to be
possible. He's all yours.

00:46.975 --> 00:48.925
This Nootka Sound is a curse.

00:49.050 --> 00:51.700
It will bring the King and Empire
down upon your head.

02:17.625 --> 02:18.775
Pick it up.

02:26.850 --> 02:29.825
So, you've no problem with
the principle of obeying me,

02:29.950 --> 02:31.525
just the execution.

02:31.650 --> 02:33.900
- Execution?
- Of Delaney.

02:34.025 --> 02:35.500
I told you to take care of it.

02:35.625 --> 02:38.300
It is taking a little longer
than I anticipated.

02:40.100 --> 02:42.450
If you open up that ball of paper,

02:42.575 --> 02:45.775
you'll see notice of your dismissal
from the East India,

02:45.900 --> 02:47.350
dated two days hence.

02:51.450 --> 02:54.650
Only Delaney's death
will render it obsolete.

03:48.250 --> 03:51.500
This is going to bring
the house down around it.

03:53.650 --> 03:54.800
Damn thing!

03:56.225 --> 03:57.625
Beg your pardon.

03:59.375 --> 04:00.525
So what's this for?

04:02.375 --> 04:03.975
To keep things safe.

04:04.100 --> 04:06.500
What things?

04:08.625 --> 04:09.775
And Brace?

04:13.900 --> 04:15.025
Go to hell!

04:15.150 --> 04:17.575
You marched with Tremain.
Now you can march with me.

04:17.700 --> 04:20.575
March where?
For what bloody purpose?

04:20.700 --> 04:22.625
For the purpose of staying alive
right now.

04:23.950 --> 04:26.925
You may choose to leave my services
if you wish, Mr. Brace.

04:27.050 --> 04:29.975
What is it about
you bloody mad Delaneys?

04:32.900 --> 04:35.125
Hang it in the meat locker.

04:35.250 --> 04:37.350
Just keep the powder
out of the steam.

04:38.350 --> 04:39.650
Bloody madhouse again!

04:41.300 --> 04:43.225
While we're on the subject
of housekeeping,

04:43.350 --> 04:46.175
I mean to have a word
with you about food.

04:46.300 --> 04:47.650
- You're hungry?
- No.

04:49.175 --> 04:52.100
Toward the end,
you said my father rarely ate.

04:52.225 --> 04:55.825
Aye, he lived on air and honey beer.

04:55.950 --> 04:59.575
- From where?
- From a man in Feather Lane.

05:00.575 --> 05:02.650
Look, it was cheaper
than the tavern and, er,

05:02.775 --> 05:05.225
- your father only gave me coppers.
- What man?

05:06.850 --> 05:08.175
A man who's since died...

05:09.150 --> 05:10.450
and his wife since left.

05:12.225 --> 05:13.425
Why do you ask?

05:15.225 --> 05:17.150
Because I am more generous
than my father.

05:18.175 --> 05:21.375
From now on, we drink beer only
from bottles and wine from flasks.

05:21.500 --> 05:22.650
That's all.

05:23.575 --> 05:24.725
Go.

06:08.025 --> 06:10.325
<i>Gentlemen, Jardine,
Matheson and Company</i>

06:10.450 --> 06:12.450
<i>would like to commence
this candle auction</i>

06:12.575 --> 06:16.225
<i>with a published list
of 12 items for sale.</i>

06:16.350 --> 06:19.500
Each item on the list will be
auctioned for the length of time

06:19.625 --> 06:23.050
it takes for its allotted candle
to burn down one inch.

06:23.175 --> 06:25.575
When the inch is burned,
the last bid will win.

06:25.700 --> 06:27.325
First item on the list...

06:27.450 --> 06:32.725
a merchantman brig commandeered from
the Spanish fleet by Captain Reeves,

06:32.850 --> 06:34.975
this last 12 months and one.

06:36.100 --> 06:40.575
Currently, the brig is named
Felice Adventurero.

06:43.175 --> 06:45.125
Who will start the bidding?

06:45.250 --> 06:47.700
610. 620.

06:47.825 --> 06:49.650
630. 640.

06:49.775 --> 06:52.175
650. 660.

06:52.300 --> 06:54.525
Do I have 670?

06:54.650 --> 06:55.825
680.

06:55.950 --> 06:57.175
690.

06:57.300 --> 06:58.500
700.

07:05.225 --> 07:06.375
£800.

07:06.500 --> 07:07.725
I say!

07:10.775 --> 07:11.975
Who is that?

07:17.500 --> 07:20.525
Felice Adventurero
sold for £800 to...?

07:20.650 --> 07:22.575
The Delaney Nootka Trading Company.

07:24.850 --> 07:26.225
I spoke to old Grady afterwards.

07:26.350 --> 07:29.325
He said Delaney told him he was
going to use the ship for trade.

07:29.450 --> 07:32.700
With whom? He said the company was
called Delaney Nootka Trading.

07:33.775 --> 07:37.200
He is planning to reopen up the
trading post to assert his ownership.

07:37.325 --> 07:40.025
That fucking man
will hang for treason!

07:50.050 --> 07:52.250
Sir, I already have
a strategy in my head.

07:58.750 --> 07:59.900
Sir.

08:01.350 --> 08:02.500
Why?

08:05.175 --> 08:07.775
Why wouldn't he even look
at our offer?

08:10.350 --> 08:12.975
Why would he defy logic
and the King?

08:13.100 --> 08:14.900
I believe he is simply trying
to raise the price.

08:15.025 --> 08:18.975
Why did he know so much about
the border negotiations, hmm?

08:20.550 --> 08:22.550
How did he know
they were taking place in Ghent?

08:23.825 --> 08:26.050
The location is a state secret.

08:31.775 --> 08:34.299
And where did he get the money to
buy a ship?!

08:38.350 --> 08:39.500
Hmm?

08:44.975 --> 08:46.350
Jesus Christ!

08:47.900 --> 08:49.900
Am I the only one in this company
with a brain?

08:55.225 --> 08:57.500
They got to him first.

09:00.775 --> 09:04.500
Either in Africa
or on the journey back to London.

09:04.625 --> 09:07.900
One of their agents approached him,
briefed him,

09:08.025 --> 09:11.825
gave him money
and secured his services.

09:13.700 --> 09:14.950
Who, who did, sir?

09:17.225 --> 09:18.825
The fucking Americans!

09:38.100 --> 09:39.650
[men shout[

09:41.700 --> 09:43.375
Atticus!

09:49.850 --> 09:51.575
Atticus!

10:01.350 --> 10:02.625
James Delaney.

10:04.550 --> 10:05.825
Well, look at you.

10:10.850 --> 10:12.000
Sit down.

10:22.750 --> 10:24.650
Give me back my horse.

10:24.775 --> 10:26.575
What's the biggest thing you saw?

10:26.700 --> 10:28.775
For my files...
my book about the world.

10:28.900 --> 10:31.300
What's the biggest thing you saw
in Africa?

10:31.425 --> 10:32.650
An elephant.

10:33.950 --> 10:35.250
How tall was it?

10:35.375 --> 10:37.425
Atticus, give me my horse back.

10:40.050 --> 10:43.050
100 foot high,
some of them, I've heard.

10:43.175 --> 10:46.825
Atticus, you stole my horse
and you left your name...

10:48.375 --> 10:51.100
so what do you want?

10:54.650 --> 10:56.050
As you may recall,

10:56.175 --> 10:58.850
I'm going to write a book one day
about all I know about the world.

10:58.975 --> 11:02.050
I don't care.
And I've been to most places,

11:02.175 --> 11:04.575
but not the devil's back yard
where you went.

11:04.700 --> 11:07.375
What's the biggest thing you saw,
and the smallest?

11:09.750 --> 11:11.775
And also the money
your father owed me.

11:11.900 --> 11:14.550
Ah! See, there it is.

11:16.750 --> 11:18.300
Nothing changes.

11:18.425 --> 11:21.500
Are you more comfortable with
business than with learning, James?

11:22.900 --> 11:24.700
£20 is what I'm owed.

11:24.825 --> 11:27.700
I know you have gold...
you just bought a ship... so pay up.

11:27.825 --> 11:30.925
- For what? - Well, you know,
when someone wants a man killed,

11:31.050 --> 11:33.950
- they come to Dolphin.
- What, still?

11:35.225 --> 11:37.525
My directory of knowledge
covers every fucking thing

11:37.650 --> 11:40.525
from cradle to grave...
birth, love, death,

11:40.650 --> 11:43.700
it all goes into the river
of my book. Hmm!

11:43.825 --> 11:46.625
When someone wants a man killed,
they come to Atticus.

11:48.025 --> 11:50.300
Well, about a year ago,
a gentleman comes in,

11:50.425 --> 11:52.125
sat right there where you are now,

11:52.250 --> 11:54.775
and says,
"How about old Horace Delaney,

11:54.900 --> 11:58.125
"the mad bastard lighting fires
by the river?

11:58.250 --> 12:02.425
"Say he falls in, the current
takes him, how about that?"

12:03.650 --> 12:05.900
So I says to the gentleman...

12:06.025 --> 12:11.425
"I sailed with old Horace
all around the world."

12:12.575 --> 12:15.825
See? So I said,
"You go or I'll slit your gizzard

12:15.950 --> 12:19.025
"and drop you in the current you had
planned with Captain Delaney."

12:19.150 --> 12:20.750
And who was this gentleman?

12:27.425 --> 12:29.525
What was the smallest thing you saw?

12:29.650 --> 12:31.175
Human kindness.

12:33.300 --> 12:34.700
An ant.

12:39.850 --> 12:41.000
Was he a company man?

12:42.025 --> 12:44.300
I'd say he wasn't East India.

12:44.425 --> 12:46.575
More from up Leadenhall.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.375
I could tell by the cut of his jib.

12:48.500 --> 12:51.325
So, how much will you give me for
not killing your father? Nothing.

12:51.450 --> 12:52.525
He's dead.

12:52.650 --> 12:55.725
Well, £15...
...and the return of your horse.

12:55.850 --> 13:00.450
I will give you £15,
minus the heels on my boots...

13:01.450 --> 13:04.550
and I will need your eyes and ears
from now on as well.

13:05.625 --> 13:07.975
Yeah, well, the enemies
you're stirring up, James,

13:08.100 --> 13:09.900
you'll be needing them, my boy.

13:20.775 --> 13:22.375
How is he this morning?

13:22.500 --> 13:24.100
Toe and arse this morning, sir.

13:24.225 --> 13:25.325
Oh, God.

13:25.450 --> 13:29.025
I know about his toe.
What happened to his arse?

13:29.150 --> 13:30.500
One can only imagine.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.950
Solomon Coop, your Highness.

13:42.550 --> 13:44.450
How is your toe this morning?

13:45.550 --> 13:47.775
My toe is the first item
of business.

13:47.900 --> 13:49.775
You evidently don't read the papers.

13:51.625 --> 13:53.425
Oh, you mean the blockade?

13:53.550 --> 13:54.700
Fuck them!

13:55.975 --> 14:00.450
Now, the red crosses are the
positions of the American ships.

14:02.300 --> 14:06.575
They are attempting to blockade
our trading routes to the West.

14:06.700 --> 14:10.575
And the blue crosses
are the Royal Navy ships,

14:10.700 --> 14:13.050
um, preparing to engage.

14:13.175 --> 14:15.775
Why did you make the Americans red?

14:15.900 --> 14:18.575
Why did you make them red?
It's us who should be red.

14:18.700 --> 14:20.175
We wear red.

14:20.300 --> 14:22.025
The Admiralty drew up the map.

14:23.375 --> 14:27.525
Now, they say that the Irish

14:27.650 --> 14:32.450
are supplying the blockade
with tack and pork,

14:32.575 --> 14:34.775
but they will soon
run short of powder.

14:36.550 --> 14:38.500
Get the Admiralty
to draw the map again,

14:38.625 --> 14:42.225
and make the British red
and the Americans...

14:42.350 --> 14:46.650
green or something,
since they are so new.

14:48.375 --> 14:50.100
But of course, your Highness.

14:54.775 --> 14:56.450
I had a dream last night.

14:57.825 --> 15:02.175
I was lying in the North Sea.
My body was England.

15:02.300 --> 15:04.825
I was an island...
Coop, pay attention!

15:07.450 --> 15:12.425
All these shrimps, like devils,
with little bows and arrows,

15:12.550 --> 15:15.325
were surrounding me,
firing into my flesh.

15:15.450 --> 15:18.225
You really must try and drink
more from the green bottle

15:18.350 --> 15:19.975
and less from the pink.

15:20.100 --> 15:21.500
It wasn't just a dream.

15:22.775 --> 15:24.225
It was a premonition.

15:25.775 --> 15:29.050
The shrimps were
the American ships.

15:29.175 --> 15:30.775
Hear me, Coop.

15:30.900 --> 15:32.850
I am lying in the ocean like a whale

15:32.975 --> 15:36.550
and no-one in my Privy Council
will raise a musket barrel!

15:37.550 --> 15:40.425
You sail this close to my nose,

15:40.550 --> 15:42.650
a kind of classless rebels,

15:42.775 --> 15:44.500
and you show me red crosses.

15:44.625 --> 15:46.300
Your Highness,
they will run out of powder.

15:46.425 --> 15:48.625
And I have run out
of fucking patience.

15:49.900 --> 15:52.775
Tell the Admiralty,
although the gossips say

15:52.900 --> 15:57.025
that all Prinny wants is
flowers and waltzes,

15:57.150 --> 16:01.425
in truth, Prinny also demands
the American ships be sunk,

16:01.550 --> 16:03.825
the survivors hanged,

16:03.950 --> 16:07.225
the bodies of the drowned nailed
to the church walls of Ireland

16:07.350 --> 16:10.050
to stop their rebels
making common cause.

16:11.350 --> 16:13.450
- Do you want me to write this down?
- Yes!

16:16.375 --> 16:19.825
- What the fuck is this?
- Oh, it's, um, from the East India.

16:19.950 --> 16:21.100
Fuck them as well.

16:22.250 --> 16:23.400
I intend to.

16:58.175 --> 17:00.025
Who are you? Winter.

17:00.150 --> 17:02.725
- Miss Winter.
- No, just Winter.

17:02.850 --> 17:05.825
Just Winter. I live with
the whores, but I'm a virgin.

17:07.950 --> 17:10.425
- Why are you following me?
- To save your life.

17:13.575 --> 17:16.775
Mistress Helga gave information
to a man with a silver tooth.

17:17.750 --> 17:20.500
I spy on her.
From the conversation,

17:20.625 --> 17:23.575
he meant to do you harm,
and the mistress knew it.

17:24.974 --> 17:27.300
She wants you dead,
so she can have her rooms back.

17:27.425 --> 17:28.625
Hmm.

17:30.625 --> 17:31.775
How old are you?

17:32.625 --> 17:33.775
13.

17:35.825 --> 17:38.100
Why would she keep you
and not rent you?

17:38.225 --> 17:39.600
Too ugly.

17:39.725 --> 17:42.650
She says, one day, I'll catch
a man and he'll carry me away.

17:45.025 --> 17:46.175
Someone like you.

17:47.825 --> 17:49.175
I spied you, too.

17:51.025 --> 17:53.225
Tell me about this man
with the silver tooth...

17:55.175 --> 17:56.325
Winter.

17:56.450 --> 17:58.950
I can show you where he's moored,
if you want.

18:03.775 --> 18:06.125
He sleeps on this ship alone?

18:06.250 --> 18:09.625
He takes a particular girl abroad
and does mean things,

18:09.750 --> 18:11.250
but there's no-one else.

18:13.550 --> 18:14.700
Are you tricking me?

18:16.375 --> 18:17.525
No.

18:23.825 --> 18:25.250
They say you was in Africa.

18:26.350 --> 18:28.125
What is it like?

18:28.250 --> 18:29.900
Is everybody naked?

18:30.025 --> 18:31.250
Hmm.

18:33.350 --> 18:34.700
I want to go to America.

18:38.575 --> 18:40.550
Promise to take me
to America one day.

18:42.850 --> 18:44.325
New York or Boston?

18:45.825 --> 18:47.525
The current here heads
for Gravesend.

18:47.650 --> 18:49.175
You know navigation.

18:49.300 --> 18:52.250
Yes.
Us larks all want to be sailors.

18:56.450 --> 18:58.650
- That's his sloop.
- Right.

19:04.550 --> 19:07.050
Why do you even believe
I'm telling the truth?

19:07.175 --> 19:08.500
Because...

19:09.750 --> 19:11.300
What are you going to do?

19:11.425 --> 19:15.100
Well, I shall ask him
why he's been sent to kill me...

19:16.350 --> 19:18.225
and by who.

19:18.350 --> 19:19.575
Stay.

22:13.375 --> 22:15.525
The very same smell.

22:15.650 --> 22:17.625
Same smell as what?

22:17.750 --> 22:22.650
As your father's clothes when
he would go dancing on the foreshore

22:22.775 --> 22:24.375
and light his fires.

22:31.625 --> 22:35.575
Brace, where did my father keep
his most important things?

22:35.700 --> 22:37.150
What is it you're looking for?

22:39.350 --> 22:41.225
The Nootka Sound treaty.

22:46.175 --> 22:48.025
It may be written on deerskin.

22:48.150 --> 22:49.975
So what you're saying is...

22:50.100 --> 22:56.050
"Brace, do you have any idea where
I can find ma ain death warrant?"

22:56.175 --> 22:58.250
I may need to prove to a tribunal

22:58.375 --> 23:01.700
that the land was acquired by treaty
and not by conquest.

23:01.825 --> 23:03.575
Tribunal?

23:03.700 --> 23:05.050
Yeah.

23:05.175 --> 23:10.250
Or they'll proudly try to seize it
and claim it as a spoil of war.

23:10.375 --> 23:14.300
Sir, I have seen
nae deerskin treaty,

23:14.425 --> 23:17.350
nor have I seen fairies
or water sprites.

23:18.425 --> 23:24.525
But what I do have are Malay coins,
enough to bury you.

23:24.650 --> 23:28.650
Prayer beads,
not enough to get you to heaven.

23:28.775 --> 23:32.900
And hashish,
enough to ease my grieving

23:33.025 --> 23:36.425
when the East India Company
slit your throat,

23:36.550 --> 23:38.175
which, of course, they will.

23:58.775 --> 24:00.500
You have appointments today.

24:01.625 --> 24:03.900
Breakfast will be out
in half an hour...

24:04.950 --> 24:07.625
if you can contrive
to stay alive that long.

24:28.100 --> 24:29.300
Ah!

24:32.100 --> 24:33.500
Ah...

26:06.250 --> 26:07.525
Thank you.

26:07.650 --> 26:11.125
That was turning out to be
a long, drawn-out process.

26:11.250 --> 26:13.625
I'd benefit from a period
of reflection.

26:15.300 --> 26:18.050
Do you have a girl here
called Winter?

26:18.175 --> 26:20.300
You can have any girl you want.

26:20.425 --> 26:22.225
I do not have a girl of that name.

26:22.350 --> 26:24.100
No?

26:24.225 --> 26:25.500
A mulatto?

26:27.100 --> 26:30.125
I would kill for a mulatto...
the Danish pay double.

26:30.250 --> 26:31.975
Hmm...

26:33.025 --> 26:34.175
I met her.

26:37.300 --> 26:39.575
- People are saying you're mad.
- I am.

26:52.350 --> 26:54.100
I like to see what lies beneath.

26:56.100 --> 26:57.450
Hmm?

27:02.025 --> 27:03.375
You have goodness in you.

27:04.700 --> 27:06.125
- What goodness?
- You do, you do.

27:06.250 --> 27:09.350
You have goodness in you...
I can see it in your eyes...

27:13.975 --> 27:15.700
and you have the same eyes as her.

27:17.100 --> 27:20.775
Winter, she's your daughter,
isn't she?

27:21.850 --> 27:23.750
And that's why you don't rent her.

27:27.050 --> 27:28.200
Am I wrong?

27:32.550 --> 27:36.100
I would rather that you worked
with me rather than against me.

27:37.450 --> 27:40.350
- Work at what?
- Necessary evil.

27:41.300 --> 27:45.025
And whorehouses are full of secrets,
and secrets, to me, are weapons.

27:46.900 --> 27:49.300
I would very much like
to talk business...

27:51.250 --> 27:53.350
but I would like you
inside of me, Mr. Delaney.

27:54.550 --> 27:55.750
It's my first condition.

27:57.025 --> 27:59.625
I need to know where
Mr. Silver Tooth is hiding.

28:01.250 --> 28:02.400
Your new friend.

28:04.775 --> 28:05.925
Do you know him?

28:08.850 --> 28:11.050
I will ask after the Malay. Ah...

28:12.700 --> 28:13.850
the Malay?

28:18.950 --> 28:20.100
Hmm.

28:26.650 --> 28:28.175
Thank you for your help.

28:37.050 --> 28:38.375
Mr. Delaney?

28:40.150 --> 28:42.250
The Felice Adventurero...
it's all yours now, sir.

28:45.500 --> 28:46.850
Thank you.

30:23.825 --> 30:25.350
What was this ship?

30:31.900 --> 30:33.350
What was this ship?

30:45.650 --> 30:48.625
Me and you. See you. Ah.

30:51.900 --> 30:55.650
Ah!

31:06.750 --> 31:09.650
Help me! Captain!

32:27.150 --> 32:29.550
Holy Christ!
Where the hell have you been?

32:31.575 --> 32:33.950
I made a fire in your room
for the mice.

32:35.175 --> 32:39.250
In Parliament today, they'll be
debating the beating of servants.

32:39.375 --> 32:41.625
The Whigs want to protect you.

32:41.750 --> 32:43.550
I believe
that would lead to anarchy.

32:45.975 --> 32:47.450
Are you not ever hungry?

32:48.500 --> 32:50.050
I ate in the whorehouse.

32:50.175 --> 32:52.225
To qualify as food,
it needs to be solid.

32:54.025 --> 32:56.700
I made some coffee...
that'll be stone-cold.

32:56.825 --> 32:58.175
Aren't we all?

33:00.050 --> 33:01.950
Where the hell are you going now?

33:03.050 --> 33:05.700
Someone has been brought to London
to try and kill me.

33:05.825 --> 33:08.175
I want to speak to them
and ask them why.

33:08.300 --> 33:09.450
Clean it.

33:34.650 --> 33:37.550
I'm looking for Dr. Dumbarton.
Follow the smell inside.

33:53.975 --> 33:57.300
I'm off-duty.
I have a wound in my left shoulder.

34:02.650 --> 34:04.850
- A bullet wound?
- A splinter...

34:07.250 --> 34:10.425
from the mast of a ship
called the Yankee Prize...

34:11.574 --> 34:13.550
that was struck by a Yankee ball.

34:21.775 --> 34:23.500
So I should call you comrade?

34:24.550 --> 34:25.850
We shall see.

34:36.625 --> 34:39.125
How God makes his colours,
I know not,

34:39.250 --> 34:41.900
but I'm pursuing him through
his chemicals.

34:42.025 --> 34:43.699
They said you were a doctor.

34:43.824 --> 34:49.350
A sheep is a sheep,
but also meat and wool.

34:51.375 --> 34:54.625
This is my pastime...
fixing colours in cloth.

34:55.775 --> 34:58.850
The demand for flags is always high
in times of war.

34:58.975 --> 35:00.700
So you are three things, yes?

35:03.250 --> 35:04.400
You are a doctor...

35:06.175 --> 35:07.325
you are a merchant...

35:08.650 --> 35:09.850
and you are a spy.

35:11.100 --> 35:12.450
Unless you tell me who sent you,

35:12.575 --> 35:15.125
I will have to ask you
to leave at the point of a gun.

35:15.250 --> 35:16.850
A man who called himself Colonay.

35:16.975 --> 35:18.375
Uh-huh.

35:18.500 --> 35:20.050
Not yet in Hell?

35:22.350 --> 35:24.775
No, Ponta Delgada and the Azores.

35:26.050 --> 35:27.175
Similar.

35:27.300 --> 35:31.900
You should know the wound in the shoulder
is no longer used by us as a signal. No?

35:32.025 --> 35:34.900
No, we change the codes
when we think that perhaps

35:35.025 --> 35:37.125
the scum British have overtaken it.

35:37.250 --> 35:39.975
And you do not trust
the name Colonay?

35:41.950 --> 35:43.225
What do you want?

35:44.825 --> 35:46.250
I want a line of conference

35:46.375 --> 35:49.175
with the President
of the 15 states of America.

35:50.150 --> 35:51.500
My name is James Delaney.

35:52.650 --> 35:53.900
That name means nothing.

35:54.025 --> 35:56.250
But it will to the President
and his representatives,

35:56.375 --> 35:58.650
who are travelling
to the negotiations in Ghent.

36:00.050 --> 36:02.850
The border between the United States
and Canada is being drawn up

36:02.975 --> 36:07.425
in a very... quiet...
closed room, no?

36:09.500 --> 36:12.425
You see, I have something
of great value to your nation.

36:14.375 --> 36:17.150
Something the British are
trying to kill me for.

36:23.350 --> 36:25.025
And what?

36:25.150 --> 36:27.050
You seek protection?

36:27.175 --> 36:28.625
I have demands.

36:28.750 --> 36:30.100
Demands?

36:30.225 --> 36:31.825
You tell Carlsbad my name.

36:33.350 --> 36:35.900
And who's Carlsbad?
Carlsbad is the head

36:36.025 --> 36:40.050
of the American Society of
Secret Correspondence in London.

36:41.775 --> 36:44.725
I know that name,
because Colonay told me it.

36:44.850 --> 36:46.975
He was drunk.

36:47.100 --> 36:49.725
He was trying
to push his jelly up a whore.

36:49.850 --> 36:53.650
Carlsbad will know my name
and know my business.

36:57.650 --> 37:00.575
I'm afraid you've used
the wrong words.

37:00.700 --> 37:01.950
Get out.

37:07.175 --> 37:09.900
Do you treat sickness
of the mind, Doctor?

37:10.025 --> 37:11.175
Just keep walking.

37:13.700 --> 37:15.650
You're mad to have even come here.

37:18.825 --> 37:20.025
We are an angry nation.

37:21.100 --> 37:22.250
Yeah.

37:23.900 --> 37:25.050
I'm counting on it.

37:29.025 --> 37:30.175
Good day.

37:48.650 --> 37:49.800
Post for you, madam.

38:30.425 --> 38:33.925
I intend to begin by reading your
father's last will and testament,

38:34.050 --> 38:38.425
and then I shall try to reason
with his creditors.

38:38.550 --> 38:42.775
Have you decided yet
what you will do with Nootka?

38:42.900 --> 38:45.825
Yes, I will use it for trade.
With whom?

38:45.950 --> 38:49.150
There are only savages at Nootka.
Then I will trade with them.

38:51.775 --> 38:53.625
I hear you bought a ship. I did,

38:53.750 --> 38:57.050
then I discovered that it was
formerly used for carrying slaves.

38:57.175 --> 39:00.100
I checked the vessel's log and,
before it was taken by the Spanish,

39:00.225 --> 39:03.525
it was once owned by
the Honourable East India Company.

39:03.650 --> 39:05.775
The shackles were all cast
in London.

39:07.350 --> 39:10.575
- East India don't deal slaves.
- No, no, they don't.

39:12.175 --> 39:14.975
But they do run cloth
and trade beads to Tangiers

39:15.100 --> 39:16.450
with the Scarfe family,

39:16.575 --> 39:18.575
and then slaves to Trinidad...

39:20.050 --> 39:21.200
from Bunce Island...

39:22.575 --> 39:24.300
through Spanish privateers.

39:29.700 --> 39:33.250
For one with such close connections,
I am surprised that you don't know.

39:34.425 --> 39:36.050
And what connections are they?

39:37.575 --> 39:38.725
Mr. Thoyt...

39:40.175 --> 39:45.125
you have been my father's lawyer
for the past 40 years.

39:45.250 --> 39:48.525
And in all that time,
you reported every detail

39:48.650 --> 39:52.625
of his most intimate business to his
enemies at the East India Company.

39:55.950 --> 39:57.225
You are their whore.

39:59.025 --> 40:02.100
The same as almost
everyone else in this city,

40:02.225 --> 40:05.975
apart from those who are
actually labelled a whore.

40:09.575 --> 40:10.850
Come on, James.

40:14.625 --> 40:18.100
When you left London, the East India
was a trading company.

40:18.225 --> 40:19.450
Now it is God Almighty.

40:21.700 --> 40:23.375
The Prince Regent fears it.

40:23.500 --> 40:26.300
No government in the world
dares to stand up to it.

40:26.425 --> 40:30.575
It owns the land, the ocean,
the fucking sky above our heads.

40:32.025 --> 40:35.050
It has more men
and weapons and ships

40:35.175 --> 40:38.225
than all
the Christian nations combined.

40:38.350 --> 40:41.575
You think all who submit are evil.

40:41.700 --> 40:42.850
No.

40:44.550 --> 40:46.775
We are submitting to the way
the world has become.

40:55.150 --> 40:57.150
All the good men in London...

40:58.300 --> 41:00.425
who fight them
are washed up at Tilbury.

41:02.775 --> 41:05.375
They could hold a congress.

41:06.825 --> 41:09.825
Or perhaps they could simply board
a ship and sail to Boston,

41:09.950 --> 41:12.175
where the Company dare not go.

41:16.750 --> 41:18.825
So...

41:18.950 --> 41:20.750
you'll add treason to the list?

41:22.025 --> 41:24.625
The King and Company
after your head.

41:30.575 --> 41:33.775
It's all rabble...
pitch makers, carpenters.

41:33.900 --> 41:36.500
Your father didn't pay any bills
for four years.

41:36.625 --> 41:39.650
They feel deeply aggrieved
and talk of seizures.

41:39.775 --> 41:43.900
I'm not being at all fanciful
when I ask if you are armed.

41:44.025 --> 41:45.175
I am armed.

41:51.625 --> 41:53.500
There he is! Shame on you!

41:55.900 --> 41:57.700
Let the man through!

41:57.825 --> 41:59.500
Where's the money, Delaney?!

42:07.775 --> 42:09.425
Gentleman! You are all here,

42:09.550 --> 42:11.900
subsequent to a written notice of
Horace Delaney's death.

42:14.175 --> 42:15.500
I'll deal first...

42:15.625 --> 42:17.850
with the beneficiaries and then

42:17.975 --> 42:19.625
with the division straight after.

42:19.750 --> 42:21.450
I said straight after!

42:21.575 --> 42:23.850
Shut up! Let them get on with it.

42:23.975 --> 42:25.925
We've waited long enough.

42:31.100 --> 42:33.375
Mr. Delaney died a widower.

42:33.500 --> 42:38.625
He is survived by two children,
both present at this division.

42:38.750 --> 42:44.175
Of his daughter, Zilpha Annabel
Delaney, now Zilpha Annabel Geary,

42:44.300 --> 42:48.225
there is no mention in
this last will and testament.

42:51.975 --> 42:55.825
To his son, James Keziah Delaney,

42:55.950 --> 43:00.250
is left the only existing assets
of the Delaney estate,

43:00.375 --> 43:05.175
including the Nootka trading post
and landing ground on the Pacific

43:05.300 --> 43:11.225
north-west coast of the Americas, in
what was formerly Spanish America.

43:11.350 --> 43:14.225
Whatever you have, you will sell...

43:14.350 --> 43:16.775
There must be order
for me to continue!

43:16.900 --> 43:22.125
We can leave now. No. We will
haunt this nigger to justice!

43:22.250 --> 43:24.125
He's already haunted.

43:24.250 --> 43:26.100
Come.

43:34.700 --> 43:36.925
Be sure of this, Delaney!

43:37.050 --> 43:40.500
That legacy is your death sentence!

43:43.775 --> 43:47.025
Out of my way!

43:47.150 --> 43:51.175
I must have order
in order to continue!

43:51.300 --> 43:53.925
I dug new foundations
for that old bastard...

43:54.050 --> 43:56.175
and I never got a penny.

43:56.300 --> 43:59.775
The son does not inherit
the debts of the father.

44:01.300 --> 44:07.300
James Delaney has declared a new
trading company in his own name.

44:14.950 --> 44:20.950
And my father's debts amounted to a
sum total of £215 and 17 shillings.

44:23.425 --> 44:28.350
Behold, £215 and 17 shillings.

44:30.300 --> 44:33.650
Mr. Thoyt will pay each one of you
exactly what you are due,

44:33.775 --> 44:36.750
but you will form an orderly line.

44:41.575 --> 44:44.100
You will form an orderly line.

44:48.850 --> 44:50.000
Orderly!

44:51.500 --> 44:54.425
I didn't expect that.
He's a better man than his father.

44:54.550 --> 44:56.375
Hurry up!

44:56.500 --> 44:58.900
At least he's sorting
his father's debts.

45:00.625 --> 45:02.950
What I'm owed isn't
in that pile of coins...

45:04.150 --> 45:07.575
since I'm not listed
on the final division notice.

45:07.700 --> 45:11.525
You see? The old skinflint
didn't even pay for his whores!

45:14.350 --> 45:17.050
And what exactly is it
that my father owed you?

45:19.825 --> 45:21.975
He owed me a lifetime of care.

45:23.575 --> 45:25.100
A lifetime of devotion.

45:26.175 --> 45:29.025
He owed me kisses and love.

45:30.700 --> 45:34.300
He owed me a home and a fire
and perhaps children some day.

45:34.425 --> 45:40.425
In short, he owed me all that is due
from a husband to a wife.

45:43.100 --> 45:47.025
My name is Lorna Delaney,
formerly Lorna Bow,

45:47.150 --> 45:48.525
and, two years ago in Dublin,

45:48.650 --> 45:50.775
Horace Delaney and I were married.

45:50.900 --> 45:53.750
And I have proof
that I am his widow.

45:56.250 --> 45:58.925
I'll have my clerks
divide up the silver.

45:59.050 --> 46:00.225
Madam?

46:01.700 --> 46:03.150
Come to my office.

46:07.550 --> 46:09.825
Calm, pretty, certain, fragrant.

46:11.700 --> 46:13.850
Calm, pretty, certain, fragrant.

46:19.950 --> 46:22.500
This is an Irish document.

46:22.625 --> 46:26.050
It may take a little time
to validate.

46:26.175 --> 46:27.850
I can wait.

46:27.975 --> 46:32.500
But Mr. Delaney's son
knew nothing of any marriage.

46:32.625 --> 46:35.100
How would he? He was in Africa.

46:35.225 --> 46:37.725
But he often spoke of you.
He was very, very proud.

46:37.850 --> 46:40.375
- Why Dublin?
- Well, he was on business.

46:40.500 --> 46:42.850
Yes, but your business is here,
isn't it?

46:42.975 --> 46:45.900
You're an actress who appeared
on stage at the Theatre Royal

46:46.025 --> 46:48.575
in Covent Garden in a play
called The Painted Savage.

46:48.700 --> 46:53.050
I found a <i>programme</i> with an
illustration in an empty drawer.

46:53.175 --> 46:56.050
Well, if my likeness was in there,
the drawer wasn't empty.

46:56.175 --> 46:58.725
If the paperwork from Dublin
is validated,

46:58.850 --> 47:01.925
Miss Bow will have
a legal claim against his estate

47:02.050 --> 47:04.375
as widow. Mrs. Delaney is my name.

47:04.500 --> 47:06.250
Bow was the name that
I used for the stage.

47:06.375 --> 47:08.825
- Are you a good actress?
- Your father thought so.

47:08.950 --> 47:12.700
And was that before
or after he lost his mind?

47:12.825 --> 47:16.250
Well, love is a kind of madness,
isn't it, Mr. Thoyt?

47:16.375 --> 47:18.500
Or have you never experienced it?

47:20.450 --> 47:24.100
My father was a very sick
and old man.

47:25.350 --> 47:27.125
Do you have proof of consummation?

47:27.250 --> 47:31.725
I have letters, many letters
professing his feelings for me.

47:31.850 --> 47:34.575
A line from memory is...

47:34.700 --> 47:37.375
"Oh, Lorna, it is in a moment

47:37.500 --> 47:40.100
"that I would leave
this cursed house by the river

47:40.225 --> 47:44.300
"and go to the Americas with you
and live there, naked and savage,

47:44.425 --> 47:47.625
"and yet, we would have
each other and be together."

47:48.950 --> 47:50.325
That kind of thing.

47:50.450 --> 47:52.250
Do you possess
any other documents of his?

47:52.375 --> 47:54.700
I have letters.
Other than letters?

47:57.375 --> 47:59.750
Well, what kind of documents?

48:02.175 --> 48:04.500
Well, proof will come
from pen and ink.

48:04.625 --> 48:07.725
I will dispatch an enquiry
to the Trinity Church in Dublin

48:07.850 --> 48:11.325
and request a personal account
from the priest. Until then,

48:11.450 --> 48:15.900
I suggest you two refrain from
any further contact with each other.

48:16.025 --> 48:18.925
Well, I have no love
for the theatre.

48:19.050 --> 48:22.050
And I spend very little time
in German brothels.

48:40.500 --> 48:44.250
Was he in there? The man...
did you see him in the room?

48:44.375 --> 48:47.375
Yeah. It was him that came to the
door and was indeed in the room.

48:48.775 --> 48:52.450
He was the one who declared
your legacy a death sentence.

48:53.950 --> 48:56.100
- Hmm.
- You, er...

48:56.225 --> 48:58.625
You want him to fall
into the river, James?

49:00.500 --> 49:03.050
No, the river will take him
of its own accord.

49:06.150 --> 49:07.450
Here.

49:31.775 --> 49:34.350
Ah, Thoyt, sit down.

49:37.575 --> 49:39.175
So, gentlemen...

49:40.825 --> 49:43.050
tell us of this widow.

49:47.975 --> 49:50.300
Can none of you read?

49:50.425 --> 49:55.250
Or are you all too busy trying
to catch my eye and only pretending

49:55.375 --> 49:59.300
to read the agenda before
stretching your necks again?

50:00.550 --> 50:01.850
You, what's your name?

50:03.425 --> 50:05.575
Godfrey, Sir. Well...

50:07.450 --> 50:13.250
Godfrey, read aloud item nine
on the agenda list of ten.

50:14.500 --> 50:17.225
"During the final division of
the estate of Horace Delaney,

50:17.350 --> 50:20.575
"there appeared... an actress."

50:20.700 --> 50:22.450
An actress.

50:22.575 --> 50:25.900
Who claims to be the widow.

50:26.025 --> 50:30.025
A dispatch arrived from Dublin.
The marriage is confirmed

50:30.150 --> 50:33.150
and is legal.

50:34.975 --> 50:38.500
What is the significance
of this, Mr. Godfrey?

50:40.950 --> 50:44.375
It's not written down.
You have to work it out.

50:46.975 --> 50:49.250
Pettifer. Hmm?

50:49.375 --> 50:51.950
The girl is an opportunity.

50:53.150 --> 50:58.150
Thoyt, tell them the possibilities
of this "opportunity".

50:59.950 --> 51:03.700
She would have a claim
against James Delaney for

51:03.825 --> 51:06.500
shared ownership of Nootka.

51:06.625 --> 51:07.825
Bravo!

51:09.025 --> 51:14.500
A whore actress to the rescue
of the mighty East.

51:14.625 --> 51:19.125
It is not a foregone conclusion.
She would need to file suit.

51:19.250 --> 51:21.375
Oh, Mr. Thoyt.

51:22.900 --> 51:26.375
This widow will have
sole claim on Nootka

51:26.500 --> 51:29.500
in the event of
James Delaney's death.

51:36.175 --> 51:38.100
An event which may be imminent.

51:48.350 --> 51:50.775
Ladies and gentlemen,
please, welcome to London

51:50.900 --> 51:54.300
violin virtuoso Nicolas Mori.

51:59.350 --> 52:04.725
Tonight, composer Ludwig van
Beethoven's Sixth Symphony.

53:11.625 --> 53:13.625
James, please, don't.

53:13.750 --> 53:14.650
What?

53:14.775 --> 53:16.850
I missed you.
I couldn't bear to see you alone.

53:16.975 --> 53:20.050
Do you know, this is so old,
I could even laugh at you?

53:20.175 --> 53:21.725
And yet you came outside to see me.

53:21.850 --> 53:23.775
Because, otherwise,
you would've come to me

53:23.900 --> 53:26.100
- and made very loud declarations.
- I would, yes.

53:26.225 --> 53:28.625
Is it my loudness that troubles you?

53:28.750 --> 53:29.900
In the forest, no.

53:31.550 --> 53:32.750
In the jungle, no.

53:35.850 --> 53:38.900
You used to straighten your skirt

53:39.025 --> 53:42.225
and march away like nothing
had ever happened.

53:43.950 --> 53:45.100
Who marched away?

53:48.625 --> 53:49.950
And thank God you did.

53:51.050 --> 53:52.200
God?

53:54.025 --> 53:56.750
- This is very simple, James.
- Hmm?

53:56.875 --> 53:57.850
Take away a little
ancient history.

53:57.975 --> 53:59.825
You live in the East,
I live in the West,

53:59.950 --> 54:02.825
there are no practical difficulties.

54:02.950 --> 54:06.825
Apart from that great big river
that connects us.

54:09.350 --> 54:10.775
Did you really eat flesh?

54:16.550 --> 54:20.125
Why don't you tell your friends
that you're sick

54:20.250 --> 54:22.450
and you can come
and hear everything?

54:29.425 --> 54:31.725
I would laugh at you,
but you're not well.

54:31.850 --> 54:34.625
Ah, ah, ah!
And I can't stand to have you

54:34.750 --> 54:36.925
- this close to me...
- Well, that is a shame, isn't it?

54:37.050 --> 54:40.375
Because I will always be
this close to you.

54:42.825 --> 54:44.225
Won't I?
