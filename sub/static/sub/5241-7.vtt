WEBVTT

00:08.942 --> 00:11.923
The team lost five of six games that
I missed after M-Chuck gouged my eye.

00:11.945 --> 00:14.721
Get out of the past, okay?
We're in the happy present.

00:14.748 --> 00:16.455
I hate hospitals.
Sick people.

00:16.483 --> 00:19.692
Dying people.
Healthy people finding out they sick.

00:19.719 --> 00:22.825
Sounds of tubes sucking shit out of
all the places got leaky shit.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.267
This ain't my thing, man.

00:24.290 --> 00:26.292
I let my team down
by missing six games,

00:26.326 --> 00:28.237
but, you know, I'm back and I'm ready
to bear down and ball.

00:28.261 --> 00:31.242
Reporter: 37 points,
six rebounds, nine assists.

00:31.264 --> 00:33.904
On fire and back in the saddle.
What do you have to say?

00:33.933 --> 00:36.311
Atlanta's a great town.
Great fans.

00:36.336 --> 00:38.179
I plan on being here
for a long time.

00:38.204 --> 00:40.411
Jupiter Blackmon wants me
to be his manager.

00:40.440 --> 00:43.011
Top-ten pick in the NFL draft,
and he wants me.

00:43.043 --> 00:46.183
I sign Jupiter, I'm not always
gonna be there for Cam.

- Mr. Calloway.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.151
May I remove your sweatshirt
for the MRI?

01:56.182 --> 01:58.128
Don't bother. I'm fucked.

01:58.151 --> 02:01.530
Let's not draw any conclusions until
the doctors have viewed the images.

02:01.554 --> 02:05.764
- You suggesting I'm not fucked?
- I'm a technician, not a doctor.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.738
I already seen the doctor.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.670
The doctor sent me here
because he's stalling

02:09.696 --> 02:11.403
from telling me my knee is fucked.

02:11.431 --> 02:14.344
Let's try and remain hopeful, okay?

02:17.237 --> 02:19.183
(music playing)

02:32.719 --> 02:35.461
Can't believe you guys
are missing my game.

02:35.488 --> 02:38.731
And I can't believe you're gonna
miss us singing the national anthem.

02:38.758 --> 02:40.863
At a college game, not my game.

02:40.894 --> 02:42.430
M-Chuck: Invite us to sing
the national anthem

02:42.462 --> 02:44.908
like Georgia South Eastern
University did and we will.

02:44.931 --> 02:46.171
That college only invited you

02:46.199 --> 02:48.179
after I bought it
as a charity auction item, okay?

02:48.201 --> 02:51.375
It's not my fault that they booked you
the same time I got a game, too.

02:51.404 --> 02:52.781
I like it when we all together.

02:52.805 --> 02:55.581
Yeah, you like it when we're all
together watching you play basketball.

02:55.608 --> 02:57.610
Yeah, that, too.
You think you can come later?

02:57.644 --> 02:59.419
Oh, your game
is an hour before ours,

02:59.445 --> 03:02.756
but we got to be there like an hour
earlier, and it's an hour drive.

03:02.782 --> 03:04.955
Plenty of games we've seen you play,
plenty more to come.

03:04.984 --> 03:06.486
You're playing New York.
They suck.

03:06.519 --> 03:08.726
Your coach would give you the day off
to come see us sing.

03:08.755 --> 03:11.736
- People bought seats to see me play.
- Wasted money.

03:11.758 --> 03:13.601
<i>When you're up by 40
by the first ha“,</i>

03:13.626 --> 03:17.073
people will realize they paid
to come see you sit on the bench.

03:17.096 --> 03:19.133
- (laughing)
- Cassie: Mm.

03:19.165 --> 03:21.406
- (music playing)
- Oh, shit, what's Unc got going today?

03:21.434 --> 03:24.938
- (Cassie laughing)
- M-Chuck: Oh, no.

03:24.971 --> 03:27.008
- Cassie: That's my brother.
- Cam: Where did you find that?!

03:27.040 --> 03:30.988
♪ You were the girl who
changed my world... ♪

03:31.010 --> 03:33.820

- Fucking fuck, fuck, fuck.
- (door closes)

04:04.244 --> 04:06.918
- Fuck.
- The MRI will take about one hour.

04:06.946 --> 04:10.553
- God damn it.
- The procedure itself is painless.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.187
What the fuck is that?

04:12.218 --> 04:14.357
You ain't fucking
sticking me with that.

04:14.387 --> 04:17.732
This is a contrast agent
that will help us to see

04:17.757 --> 04:19.236
if there's any damage.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.500
You mean how much, not if.

04:21.527 --> 04:24.167
I ain't roll all the fuck the way down
to you to determine "if."

04:24.197 --> 04:27.735
- What exactly is the contrast agent?
- Gadolinium.

04:27.767 --> 04:30.714
Nah, you ain't putting
any nium-ending shit in me.

04:30.737 --> 04:33.183
I know all about
Madame Curie and radium

04:33.206 --> 04:35.709
and plutonium
and all that, nah.

04:35.742 --> 04:37.653
Well, your doctor made
a specific request

04:37.677 --> 04:39.213
to use the gadolinium in your case.

04:39.245 --> 04:40.986
My case meaning it's a bad case?

04:41.014 --> 04:44.621
- Gadolinium is perfectly safe.
- You don't know if it's safe inside me.

04:44.651 --> 04:47.564
I've never had an MRI.
You don't know if I'm allergic.

04:47.587 --> 04:51.330
- You might feel a little pinch.
- You are in kind of a sadistic rush.

04:51.357 --> 04:52.961
This room is constantly needed

04:52.992 --> 04:55.529
by many different people
every day of every year.

04:55.561 --> 04:57.598
So you need to decide
if you want to get this done

04:57.630 --> 04:59.371
or I can alert the doctor
if you need a sedative.

04:59.399 --> 05:00.878
No, I don't need a sedative.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.971
But how do I know
you're not injecting me

05:03.002 --> 05:06.415
with some kind of Tuskegee Airmen
poison experiment?

05:06.439 --> 05:09.318
- You're just gonna have to trust me.
- I barely know you.

05:09.342 --> 05:11.583
- I'm Cam.
- I know.

05:11.611 --> 05:14.421
- Shall I call the doctor?
- (sighs)

05:14.447 --> 05:16.222
Hit me with the poison,
Dr. Frankenstein.

05:19.585 --> 05:22.361
Okay.

05:22.388 --> 05:25.961
All right, now,
as it courses through your body...

05:25.992 --> 05:27.733
- Ow.
- ...it may feel warm.

05:27.760 --> 05:30.934
Like rum, just not any fun.

05:30.963 --> 05:34.103
What's your cocktail of choice?

05:35.335 --> 05:36.609
- Ow.
- All right.

05:36.636 --> 05:39.048
I need you to lean your weight on me
as I lift you.

05:39.072 --> 05:41.211
Just don't fucking drop me.

05:41.240 --> 05:42.719
I can't fuck up my other fucking knee.

05:42.742 --> 05:44.779
Language like that
really isn't necessary.

05:44.811 --> 05:47.985
Language like that was fucking invented
for situations like this.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.460
(sighs)

05:55.655 --> 05:59.000
Ah! Ow...

05:59.025 --> 06:01.699
"The Star-Spangled Banner"
is a hard song to sing

06:01.728 --> 06:03.366
because it is not well-written.

06:03.396 --> 06:06.104
- I think saying that is treason.
- And I think you saying that is wrong.

06:06.132 --> 06:07.577
So let's look over the words,
shall we?

06:07.600 --> 06:10.604
Baby, don't worry about us, okay?
We have been singing all our lives.

06:10.636 --> 06:12.775
- Mm-hmm.
- Not in front of 20,000 you ain't.

06:12.805 --> 06:15.684
Hey, bring it. I'm glad somebody's
giving us a chance to sing in public.

06:15.708 --> 06:19.417
You bought the chance at the charity
auction, which Cam bought.

06:19.445 --> 06:22.585
Hey, Cam's generosity is helping
the people with the fucked up mouths.

06:22.615 --> 06:24.253
- What's it called, Ma?
- Cluttered palates.

06:24.283 --> 06:26.559
Yeah, the money that was used
to purchase this opportunity

06:26.586 --> 06:29.829
is helping the fucked-up-mouth kids
get their cluttered palates all fixed.

06:29.856 --> 06:33.599
No, it's true. You know, they got
snaggle teeth and the weird lips.

06:33.626 --> 06:35.333
- Their shit is just all screwy.
- Yeah.

06:35.361 --> 06:37.034
- Damn.
- We must rehearse, people.

06:37.063 --> 06:39.270
- The performance is nigh.
- "Nigh"?

06:39.298 --> 06:42.177
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Fuck you from? The Emerald Forest?

06:42.201 --> 06:44.977
(music playing)

06:45.004 --> 06:47.314
- Have fun in Denver.
- All right.

06:47.340 --> 06:48.614
- Fucking right, we gonna get turnt.
- Whoa.

06:48.641 --> 06:50.917
Oh, no, we not.
We gonna lay flat and low.

06:50.943 --> 06:53.150
Have an impressive prospect visit
is what I meant.

06:53.179 --> 06:56.217
No, no, no. See, Missy, me and you
see eye to eye about the need for fun.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.786
Come nightfall, Jupiter gonna
get his dick wet Denver style.

06:58.818 --> 07:01.162
Why are you looking at me when
you say that? And you know what?

07:01.187 --> 07:03.428
You got to watch what you say
out loud in front of people.

07:03.456 --> 07:05.629
- It's a work trip.
- Man, why you always calling it "work"?

07:05.658 --> 07:07.069
That is why you signed with him.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.039
Just can't believe I'm missing
another one of Cam's games.

07:09.061 --> 07:11.132
- I hate this.
- Playing New York don't count.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.371
You're building your and his
management business.

07:13.399 --> 07:17.142
Making sure Jupiter gets a good
contract is helping that business.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.681
Wish me luck in getting these fools
through the national anthem.

07:22.708 --> 07:25.484
Look, just make sure when they punch
each other out it's off camera.

07:25.511 --> 07:28.583
- All cameras.
- All right. Love you.

07:28.614 --> 07:31.720
Reggie:
Love you.

07:31.751 --> 07:35.563
- Mm.
- Hey, that's my wife.

07:35.588 --> 07:37.966
Don't act like I don't touch myself
and think about it.

07:37.990 --> 07:39.663
What?

07:39.692 --> 07:41.729
How long do you bury me
in this metal coffin?

07:41.761 --> 07:43.741
About 45 minutes
if you can stay still.

07:43.763 --> 07:45.743
- I'm going to lean you back now.
- Wait, hold on.

07:45.765 --> 07:47.904
Now, you said a lot of people
fly in and out of here

07:47.934 --> 07:49.743
getting their shit examined
and whatnot.

07:49.769 --> 07:52.545
So due diligence on my part,
how do you go about eliminating,

07:52.572 --> 07:55.610
like totally eliminating,
all the sickness and bacteria

07:55.641 --> 07:58.679
and the blood and the maggot-infested
scabby gash residue

07:58.711 --> 08:01.715
and the antibiotic resistant,
festering, germy viruses

08:01.747 --> 08:03.454
that live and breathe in there?

08:03.483 --> 08:06.430
Well, this machine is disinfected
after every exam.

08:06.452 --> 08:08.728
Everyone washes thoroughly.
Lean back, please.

08:08.754 --> 08:10.665
Definitions of thorough vary.

08:10.690 --> 08:12.863
Mini microbes are microscopic.

08:12.892 --> 08:14.633
- Naked eye can't see.
- I am aware.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.230
But you may not be aware of

08:16.262 --> 08:19.141
is that it's the hospital "staff"
infections that are killing people.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.270
You get on the Internet,
they can't hide the stats.

08:21.300 --> 08:25.248
How does this hospital track
who on the staff is infected?

08:25.271 --> 08:27.751
"Staph" is spelled with a P-H.

08:27.773 --> 08:29.912
Yeah, because they're afraid
of the lawsuits.

08:29.942 --> 08:31.751
They changed the spelling
so they ain't liable.

08:31.777 --> 08:34.053
New spelling doesn't change the stats.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.993
- It's a totally different word.
- But it sounds the same.

08:37.015 --> 08:38.586
So connect the dots before

08:38.618 --> 08:40.996
some flesh-eating shit
eats my flesh and yours.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.523
Please stay absolutely still.

08:43.556 --> 08:45.229
Otherwise you will blur the images

08:45.258 --> 08:47.135
and we will have to redo
this entire procedure.

08:48.728 --> 08:52.437
Tell my family I said I love them
if they ever show up.

08:54.901 --> 08:57.677
And tell 'em I'm sorry.

09:01.507 --> 09:03.817
(music playing)

09:03.843 --> 09:05.845
- (exhales)
- (door closes)

09:05.878 --> 09:08.620
You know, I always thought
the lyric was "perilous night."

09:08.648 --> 09:11.151
Fight is perilous, night is not.

09:11.183 --> 09:12.662
Depends on who
you spent the night with.

09:12.685 --> 09:15.359
George Zimmerman
could be very perilous.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.834
- What are "ramparts"?
- I don't have a fucking clue.

09:17.857 --> 09:19.928
Ram parts are the horns
and meat and shit.

09:19.959 --> 09:22.940
- This song makes no sense.
- No, sailors kept rams on the ships

09:22.962 --> 09:25.704
- for their meat and to fuck 'em.
- Cassie: Julius, shut the fuck up.

09:25.731 --> 09:28.211
Look, Spanish mariners
invented hot sauce

09:28.234 --> 09:30.373
to offset the rotten taste of ram.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.713
- Look it up.
- "Look it up" is what people say

09:32.738 --> 09:34.513
when they're pulling shit
out their ass.

09:34.540 --> 09:37.146
No, "look it up" is what people said
when there were encyclopedias.

09:37.176 --> 09:40.180
- The new phrase is "Google it."
- Look it the fuck up on Google.

09:40.212 --> 09:42.954
I still don't see why
we're singing about ram parts,

09:42.982 --> 09:44.393
hot sauce or no.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.830
Ramparts-- one word--
were the top parts of the forts.

09:47.853 --> 09:51.733
- Over them, you watch things.
- Says here the word is "o'er." No V.

09:51.757 --> 09:54.931
The stars and stripes
were gallantly streaming

09:54.961 --> 09:58.465
and gave proof that our flag was seen
by the rocket's red glare.

09:58.497 --> 10:00.602
Uh, the lights from the rockets.

10:00.633 --> 10:02.670
There were rockets back in
the George Washington days?

10:02.702 --> 10:04.477
Why the fuck it take so long
to put a man on the moon?

10:04.503 --> 10:07.541
The moon landing was fake.
Look that shit up on Google, too.

10:07.573 --> 10:09.849

Oh, my God, Missy.

12:07.359 --> 12:09.464
When you started singing with us,
I mean, we were tight.

12:09.495 --> 12:11.497
Wow, y'all make me
want to love this country.

12:11.530 --> 12:13.806
I'm sorry. Sorry.
I overstepped.

12:13.833 --> 12:17.679
No, girl, you just stepped up our game.
You singing with us.

12:17.703 --> 12:19.705
I thought y'all was gonna do
some Supreme thing.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.218
Who gonna jump out
in the front like Diana?

12:21.240 --> 12:24.710

12:24.744 --> 12:27.987
Look, she gonna be in the front,

12:29.148 --> 12:31.560
- (MRI humming)
- Nurse: Doing okay in there?

12:31.584 --> 12:33.325
Fucking cloud nine.

12:33.352 --> 12:36.060
- How bad does it look?
- The doctor will share his diagnosis

12:36.088 --> 12:38.796
- once he's viewed the images.
- But you've had this job long enough

12:38.824 --> 12:42.169
to know whether I have a year-ending
injury or a career-ending injury.

12:42.194 --> 12:44.504
My job is to make certain
these images are clear.

12:44.530 --> 12:46.874
Which means your job
is to have X-ray vision,

12:46.899 --> 12:49.072
which means you could
definitely diagnose this

12:49.101 --> 12:50.910
if there were a gun pointed
at your head.

12:50.936 --> 12:55.043
If, like most guns,
it's made of metal,

12:55.074 --> 12:58.851
the giant magnet in the MRI
would pull it away from my head.

12:58.878 --> 13:01.324
So I wouldn't feel pressured
to say anything I shouldn't.

13:01.347 --> 13:03.020
How many MRls
have you administered?

13:03.048 --> 13:05.585
Enough to know that I can't speculate
on the images with a patient.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.825
Fine, don't speculate.
Speak in code.

13:07.853 --> 13:10.766
- Can you read these things?
- Almost done, Mr. Calloway.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.269
That was not my question.

13:12.291 --> 13:15.067
And I gather you're a guy who always
gets his questions answered.

13:15.094 --> 13:19.042
When it's involving my career, I like
to get as much information as I can.

13:19.064 --> 13:20.941
- Ow.
- You'll have it soon enough.

13:20.966 --> 13:25.415
Can't you just, like, wink and tell me
I'm all right? Just a wink.

13:25.437 --> 13:27.439
Let me help you down
so I can get you into that wheelchair.

13:27.473 --> 13:30.010
How long will I be
in the wheelchair?

13:30.042 --> 13:32.420
What do you look like
when you smile, Allison?

13:32.444 --> 13:34.924
- Ms. Pierce.
- Ms. Pierce, I'm a man

13:34.947 --> 13:37.860
who makes a living running and jumping,
I need my knees.

13:37.883 --> 13:40.261
If my knee is shot,
I prefer to get bad news from you.

13:40.286 --> 13:42.129
I am not qualified to answer.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.862
Let's not quibble over qualifications.
Hazard a guess.

13:44.890 --> 13:47.962
That would be unethical.
Ethics are modifiable.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.438
You've got politics in your future.

13:49.461 --> 13:52.442
I want to know if I got
basketball in my future.

13:52.464 --> 13:54.375
I'm just asking you to do me a solid

13:54.400 --> 13:56.744
and tell me, in your experience,
what we're dealing with here.

13:56.769 --> 14:00.774
I'd waive my right to ethics if you'd
consider this a unique and special case.

14:00.806 --> 14:04.151
They're my ethics, not yours,
and everyone's a special case.

14:04.176 --> 14:07.385
How many MRls have you taken
that involved career-ending injuries?

14:07.413 --> 14:09.950
Many less than those
that involve life-ending tumors.

14:09.982 --> 14:12.121
- My knee has a tumor?
- (scoffs)

14:12.151 --> 14:14.757
I'll let the radiologist and your team
doctor know that we're done.

14:14.787 --> 14:16.733
You can't just say "tumor"
and drop the mic.

14:16.755 --> 14:18.132
I'm dying here.

14:18.157 --> 14:21.001
I'm not dying, but I'm dying to know.
Like, how bad is it?

14:22.628 --> 14:26.132
Shit, you're like CIA.
Just wink if I'm gonna be okay.

14:26.165 --> 14:28.304
Can't be unethical to have
something stuck in your eye

14:28.334 --> 14:30.177
and you got to wink it out.

14:30.202 --> 14:32.443
The doctors will share the results
with you momentarily.

14:39.979 --> 14:42.152
Mr. Calloway...

14:44.116 --> 14:46.153
(music playing)

14:57.196 --> 15:00.109
So we just landed, and now you flying
back to Atlanta to hold Cam's hand?

15:00.132 --> 15:02.476
What about my hand?
I haven't been drafted yet, Reggie.

15:02.501 --> 15:04.708
Jupiter, I just got to see
how bad Cam is.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.115
I'll make sure he's set up, and then
I'm getting back on a plane to you.

15:07.139 --> 15:08.675
- Missy can't handle it?
- Missy ain't his manager.

15:08.707 --> 15:10.584
- I'm just saying.
- Look, if you was in the hospital,

15:10.609 --> 15:12.555
you wouldn't want me there
looking after you?

15:12.578 --> 15:14.580
How hot are the nurses?
'Cause if they hot, I don't need you.

15:14.613 --> 15:18.117
Okay, Jupiter, here is some cash
for a taxi and a dinner.

15:18.150 --> 15:19.561
Do not leave the hotel room tonight.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.292
I'll make some calls,
I'll rearrange our stuff,

15:21.320 --> 15:23.300
and then I'm back first thing
in the morning, okay?

15:23.322 --> 15:25.928
Baggage claim is that way.
I will text you with the hotel details.

15:25.958 --> 15:27.801
- I need snacks.
- (sighs)

15:27.826 --> 15:30.705
Go directly to the hotel, room service,
get all the snacks you want.

15:30.729 --> 15:32.675
- Seriously? You paying?
- Yes.

15:32.698 --> 15:34.041
- 'Cause it's expensive.
- I know.

15:34.066 --> 15:36.137
- And cashews is, like, $60.
- I got you.

15:36.168 --> 15:39.240
- Can I have some candy?
- You're in training, Jupiter.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.512
- Get the candy. Don't leave the room.
- That's what's up.

15:41.540 --> 15:44.077
All right, go get some sleep.
I'll be back.

15:44.109 --> 15:47.215
- Tell Cam to nut up.
- All right.

15:47.246 --> 15:49.522
(music playing)

15:52.051 --> 15:55.931
Cam, you have a grade-two MCL injury.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.730
(groans)

15:57.756 --> 16:00.828
Why the hell'd you tell me
I was gonna be okay?

16:00.859 --> 16:03.897
- Excuse me?
- Ms. Pierce examined my images

16:03.929 --> 16:05.431
and told me I was gonna be okay.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.535
- That is messed up.
- Did she?

16:07.566 --> 16:10.775
- Allison, you care to comment?
- She's right.

16:10.803 --> 16:14.046
- You're gonna be okay.
- You just said I tore my MCL.

16:14.073 --> 16:16.713
No, no, I said that you have
a grade-two MCL injury.

16:16.742 --> 16:19.689
That's a strain. That's not a tear.
That's good news.

16:19.712 --> 16:22.352
What Derrick Rose had is bad news.

16:22.381 --> 16:25.760
He had a tear, but according to
these pictures, you do not have a tear.

16:25.784 --> 16:29.254
Now we're gonna send these images
over to Dr. Elattrache to confirm,

16:29.288 --> 16:31.791
- but that's all it is.
- Then why does it hurt so bad?

16:31.824 --> 16:35.431
Strain means it was pulled to
the tearing point but did not tear.

16:35.461 --> 16:38.305
Sometimes strains
hurt more than tears.

16:38.330 --> 16:41.243
- Where'd you read that?
- I said sometimes they can.

16:41.266 --> 16:43.371
And I don't need to have
read about it anywhere.

16:43.402 --> 16:45.382
I only need to have been
doing this for 25 years.

16:45.404 --> 16:48.180
And also to have been sitting next to
the bench where I saw this man

16:48.207 --> 16:50.983
hyperextend his knee
diving for a basketball.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.455
Any other flip questions?

16:52.478 --> 16:54.116
No, I was just wondering
if there was an article

16:54.146 --> 16:56.148
in a journal or something
that I missed.

16:56.181 --> 16:59.788
Yeah, you missed the article that said,
"radiologists speak when spoken to."

16:59.818 --> 17:01.422
Don't get salty with me, Huffman.

17:01.453 --> 17:04.798
Strains hurt more
than tears sometimes.

17:04.823 --> 17:06.301
That's the way the human body works.

17:06.325 --> 17:08.305
It says,
"I'm gonna make this hurt like hell

17:08.327 --> 17:10.739
because I want you to sit down
before it tears."

17:10.762 --> 17:11.763
You understand?!

17:11.797 --> 17:14.607
Sports injuries have been my work
for the past 25 years.

17:14.633 --> 17:16.977
- Yeah, you already mentioned that.
- Hey, guys, it's just a strain.

17:17.002 --> 17:20.006
You got an issue with me, why don't you
take it up with my dad, John Francoeur?

17:20.039 --> 17:23.577
- Your badge says "Frankel."
- Yeah, I changed my name.

17:23.608 --> 17:26.646
I like to see how people treat me
before they learn my lineage.

17:26.678 --> 17:29.625
I'll tell Dad how you spoke to me.
He will tune you up.

17:29.648 --> 17:32.720
Well, you tell your daddy,
Lady Bird Francoeur,

17:32.751 --> 17:35.595
any time he wants to tangle
with me, I'm here.

17:35.621 --> 17:37.658
- I'll call him right now.
- Good, text him.

17:37.689 --> 17:40.397
- I'll send him a fucking E-vite.
- Good, I'll be right here.

17:41.393 --> 17:44.533
Okay, Cam.
Listen, you're gonna miss some time.

17:44.563 --> 17:47.100
But if you stay off it
and you ice it,

17:47.132 --> 17:48.873
you should be good to go
in a couple of weeks.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.403
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

17:50.436 --> 17:51.847
I don't say things that I shouldn't.

17:51.870 --> 17:56.341
Ms. Pierce, despite your grave error
in judgment, excellent photos.

17:56.375 --> 18:00.323
Thank you, sir.
And I'm sorry about saying anything.

18:00.345 --> 18:02.951
Water under the bridge. Can you
take him over to the nurse's station?

18:02.981 --> 18:05.655
And, Cam, I'll be right with you
after I talk to Mr. Flaherty.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.466
Wait here and I'll get a nurse.

18:12.491 --> 18:14.835
Allison, I'm sorry.

18:16.428 --> 18:19.466
- You only care about yourself.
- It was a shitty thing I did.

18:19.498 --> 18:22.377
You cried boy tears and I got weak.
I've got no one to blame but myself.

18:22.401 --> 18:25.314
I was scared.
I behaved badly.

18:25.337 --> 18:28.341
Now I'm scared, laying here
under the bus with my job now at risk.

18:28.373 --> 18:30.751
Don't worry about under the bus.
He said water under the bridge.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.120
He's not my boss.
The other guy is.

18:33.145 --> 18:34.351
The one who works here full time.

18:34.379 --> 18:36.416
I've never even met
your team doctor till today.

18:36.448 --> 18:38.155
Well, that argument was about them.

18:38.183 --> 18:39.924
Some history I don't even know
what they were talking about.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.192
I'll say something to the radiologist.

18:41.220 --> 18:44.167
You will say nothing
regarding me ever again.

18:44.189 --> 18:45.862
Don't make this more than it is.

18:45.891 --> 18:47.734
You have no grasp at all, do you?

18:47.759 --> 18:50.740
I realize I was completely uncool.
Forgive me.

18:50.762 --> 18:54.141
I'll tell them it was just a joke.
I'll say that you didn't tell--

18:54.166 --> 18:55.907
Allison, listen.

18:55.934 --> 18:58.210
- Ow!
- Stop making a scene.

18:58.237 --> 19:00.342
- That was fuckin' stupid.
- Hey, get back in the chair.

19:00.372 --> 19:01.851
- Getting back, getting back.
- In the chair.

19:01.874 --> 19:05.151
Woman on P.A.:
Nutrition, 3287.

19:05.177 --> 19:07.123
- Nutrition, 3287.
- (door opens)

19:08.347 --> 19:11.226
- What's this room?
- This is the damage control room

19:11.250 --> 19:13.355
where I damage people
who are out of control.

19:13.385 --> 19:14.796
All right, calm down.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.265
I'll calm down
when it's time to calm down.

19:16.288 --> 19:19.098
- You threw me under the bus.
- You winked, you didn't tell.

19:19.124 --> 19:20.626
It's not your fault
I'm a charming guy.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.036
You're the worst kind of guy.

19:22.060 --> 19:24.939
Charming when it suits you
and selfish when you're scared.

19:24.963 --> 19:27.375
You're judging me from
a very small sample size.

19:27.399 --> 19:30.869
People's behavior under duress
reveals who they really are.

19:30.903 --> 19:33.042
You drop F-bombs on people
who are trying to help you

19:33.071 --> 19:35.244
and you put their jobs at risk
when they're trying to comfort you.

19:35.274 --> 19:39.245
This is no one's fault but my own,
but, damn, Mr. Superstar,

19:39.278 --> 19:41.121
you're a superstar jerk,
aren't you?

19:41.146 --> 19:42.716
Let me make it up to you.
Let me take you out.

19:42.748 --> 19:45.092
- (cell phone chimes)
- Right, because I'm a woman,

19:45.117 --> 19:47.028
and not only am I swayed
by boy tears,

19:47.052 --> 19:49.760
but all I really want is just a nice
dinner date to make everything better.

19:49.788 --> 19:51.267
If that's how you say yes, great.

19:51.290 --> 19:54.464
My mother would hate me for talking
like this, but my daddy would love it.

19:54.493 --> 19:57.337
Fuck you!

19:57.362 --> 19:59.433
I was in pain.
Actually, I'm still in pain.

19:59.464 --> 20:01.239
But this is good.
This is distracting me.

20:01.266 --> 20:03.303
Give me my phone
or I will call security.

20:03.335 --> 20:05.941
I'm gonna call my cell from your phone
so that I have your number

20:05.971 --> 20:07.507
and you can continue
to chew me out in private

20:07.539 --> 20:09.246
because this is really constructive.

20:09.274 --> 20:13.689
- I just need your password.
- F-U-C-K-O-F-F.

20:13.712 --> 20:16.318
"Fuckoff." Didn't work.

20:16.348 --> 20:18.624
I'll try again, but if it's wrong,
your phone's gonna freeze.

20:18.650 --> 20:20.095
Give me my fucking phone.

20:20.118 --> 20:22.257
I'm feeling something electric here.

20:22.287 --> 20:23.732
- Rage.
- Yeah, I like it.

20:23.755 --> 20:25.666
Do you want to explore this over sushi?
You like sushi?

20:25.691 --> 20:28.069
When a woman stands up to
a privileged asshole,

20:28.093 --> 20:30.266
it releases all kinds of
unfamiliar endorphins.

20:30.295 --> 20:34.004
- How about Italian?
- Get well soon, fucko.

20:34.032 --> 20:38.503
Wetzel Pretzel at Lenox Mall?

20:53.018 --> 20:54.361
It's cold in here.

20:54.386 --> 20:56.525
That's why I wear my driver's gloves.

20:56.555 --> 20:58.364
Got to get yourself
some of them lambskins.

20:58.390 --> 21:01.496
They do more for you than just condoms.
They fit my ram parts.

21:01.526 --> 21:03.403
I should be out front.

21:03.428 --> 21:05.237
- Tell her.
- Not a chance, Sparkle.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.870
Listen, can we just please
get our phones back, okay?

21:07.899 --> 21:09.173
I'm not good without my phone.

21:09.201 --> 21:10.544
My phone needs me,
and I need my phone.

21:10.569 --> 21:12.913
In due time. We need to do this
without the sheets now.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.851
Say, man, I ain't even singing.
Why'd you take my phone?

21:15.874 --> 21:18.582
Because you kept showing videos
to these guys.

21:18.610 --> 21:21.887
So instead of learning the words,
they watched.

21:21.913 --> 21:23.688
It was a little funny,
though, wasn't it?

21:23.715 --> 21:26.992
No, it wasn't. I work for
Georgia South Eastern University.

21:27.019 --> 21:30.592
And neither this school nor this nation
will be embarrassed by you.

21:30.622 --> 21:32.829
What?

21:32.858 --> 21:34.735
We go on in half an hour.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.741
Sing it right so I can get
my fucking phone back.

21:42.367 --> 21:44.779
I'll have you released.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.942
We'll transport you home in about five.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.612
- You good?
- Yeah.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.985
All right.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.356
(phone beeps)

22:05.190 --> 22:08.865
This is Dr. Huffman, could you
please connect me to the MRI room?

22:08.894 --> 22:11.738
- (phone rings)
- Allison Pierce, MRI.

22:11.763 --> 22:14.073
Cam Galloway, seriously sorry.

22:14.099 --> 22:15.772
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

22:15.801 --> 22:18.145
Look, you have every right
to be angry with me.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.707
Everything you said about me
is completely true.

22:20.739 --> 22:22.741
But I'm telling you
from the bottom of my heart,

22:22.774 --> 22:25.755
I am not the guy that you witnessed
in the last two hours of meeting me.

22:25.777 --> 22:28.587
I'm a flawed person,
but I'm not irredeemable.

22:28.613 --> 22:31.287
- And I really want to take you out.
- You keep telling me that,

22:31.316 --> 22:32.920
and I keep telling you
to leave me alone.

22:32.951 --> 22:35.124
I will if you go on one date.

22:35.153 --> 22:37.656
So I have to pay a date ransom
to stop your stalking?

22:37.689 --> 22:39.168
Whatever works.

22:39.191 --> 22:42.570
Let's just call it an off-site
formal apology appointment

22:42.594 --> 22:47.100
where I once again express my regret
for having an incredibly bad moment.

22:47.132 --> 22:49.806
Or two. Or more.

22:51.470 --> 22:53.677
My shift ends at 2:00 a.m.

22:53.705 --> 22:56.811
If you're here, maybe you
get my number, not promising.

22:56.842 --> 23:00.153
Um, look,
I got to ice and rest

23:00.178 --> 23:02.385
and then soon there's about to be
a Vicodin in my blood.

23:02.414 --> 23:05.224
- 2:00 A.M. is unlikely.
- Good. Look at us.

23:05.250 --> 23:07.958
We met, said hello,
fought, said good-bye.

23:07.986 --> 23:11.126
We got through a whole relationship
without having to have one.

23:11.156 --> 23:13.193
(sighs)

23:23.635 --> 23:26.673
Oh, my God, baby.
Why didn't you call me first thing?

23:26.705 --> 23:31.347
- I knew you had your big thing.
- Baby, you are my thing.

23:31.376 --> 23:34.550
- You're my son.
- I know. I'm fine. It's just a strain.

23:34.579 --> 23:36.820
- Thank God.
- I'm gonna be fine.

23:36.848 --> 23:39.021
I didn't want you guys to know
until after you sang.

23:39.050 --> 23:43.055
Oh, baby, you're more important to us
than some national fucking anthem.

23:43.088 --> 23:45.534
I know, but, hey,
the show must go on and all.

23:45.557 --> 23:48.401
Well, it's going on without us.

Hang on, I got-- I got
a pen and paper somewhere.

25:18.817 --> 25:23.095
- Did you get a good look at her?
- No, but I did get a look at your knee,

25:23.121 --> 25:24.566
and you need to be off it.

25:24.589 --> 25:28.002
So now that you got this random shorty's
number, can we please go home?

25:41.039 --> 25:44.646
I land in Denver,
I get all these texts.
