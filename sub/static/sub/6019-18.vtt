00:02.719 --> 00:04.631
I love when you're in
the middle of a dream...

00:06.160 --> 00:09.709
...and your alarm goes off, you
incorporate the sound into the dream...

00:09.880 --> 00:11.438
...so you can keep sleeping.

00:11.600 --> 00:14.239
And you'll make any adjustment
in the dream to do it.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.868
I was with Marie Antoinette
in a dream last night.

00:17.040 --> 00:19.315
She was on the guillotine,
the blade came down...

00:19.480 --> 00:21.391
...her head fell in the basket,
rolled over...

00:21.560 --> 00:24.996
...and she started singing
Neil Diamond's "Solitary Man."

00:26.720 --> 00:29.280
And I thought,
"That is not my alarm going off.

00:29.440 --> 00:31.829
This is actually happening."

00:35.840 --> 00:38.400
It's June! Hey!

00:39.040 --> 00:43.192
It's June! It's June, June, June!

00:43.680 --> 00:46.478
It's June! June! June!

00:47.640 --> 00:50.791
It's June!

00:53.920 --> 00:56.878
June! June, baby!

00:57.040 --> 00:59.031
-What?
-The catering hall screwed up.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.270
The wedding is delayed until June.

01:01.440 --> 01:04.637
-It's like a stay of execution.
-Dead man walking.

01:06.360 --> 01:07.839
This is my lucky day.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.752
Well, one out of 20,000.
That's not bad.

01:09.920 --> 01:12.798
Yeah. Hey, wait a second.
You know, good news for you too.

01:12.960 --> 01:15.315
Susan's friend, Hallie,
broke up with her boyfriend.

01:15.480 --> 01:16.754
-She did?
-Yeah.

01:16.920 --> 01:19.354
-So? Wheels?
-ln motion.

01:19.520 --> 01:21.670
-The wheels are in motion.
-Beautiful.

01:21.840 --> 01:23.717
Hey, if this works out, forget about it.

01:23.880 --> 01:26.997
Vacations together, movies together,
dinner together.

01:27.160 --> 01:29.116
It's almost as good
as if I didn't get married.

01:29.280 --> 01:31.510
Set it up. We can have
dinner at the Friars Club.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.631
-The Friars Club?
-I'm thinking of joining.

01:33.800 --> 01:36.473
Pat Cooper said he would
put me up for membership.

01:36.640 --> 01:40.838
Hey. Listen, do me a favor, will you?
I got a hot date tonight with Connie.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.672
Wake me up in 20 minutes,
all right?

01:42.840 --> 01:45.308
-Catnap?
-No, no, no, no. This is evolutionary.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.313
I've been reading this book
on Leonardo da Vinci.

01:48.480 --> 01:50.869
See, that means "from Vinci."
Did you know that?

01:51.040 --> 01:52.234
-Must be some book.
-Yeah.

01:52.400 --> 01:56.188
Well, it turns out that the master slept
only 20 minutes every three hours.

01:56.360 --> 01:58.237
That works to two and a half
extra days...

01:58.400 --> 02:00.311
...that I'm awake per week,
every week.

02:00.480 --> 02:06.237
Which means if I live to be 80, I will
have lived the equivalent of 105 years.

02:06.400 --> 02:07.913
Not to mention how much
you'll accomplish.

02:08.080 --> 02:10.389
-I got a lot in the hopper.
-Didn't know you had one.

02:10.560 --> 02:13.438
Oh, I got a hopper. A big hopper.

02:14.640 --> 02:15.834
All right, people...

02:16.000 --> 02:19.037
...I'd like to begin with a hearty
"hail and well met, good fellow"...

02:19.200 --> 02:21.509
...to Bob Grossberg,
joining us from Business Affairs.

02:21.680 --> 02:23.989
Thanks. Hi, everybody.

02:24.920 --> 02:28.230
Bob, we have a little baptism by fire
for you, so to speak.

02:28.640 --> 02:30.517
Poor bastard.

02:30.680 --> 02:32.955
You handle all the fact-checking
and copyediting...

02:33.120 --> 02:34.314
...for the new catalog.

02:34.960 --> 02:36.154
Could you repeat that?

02:37.160 --> 02:39.628
Why don't you handle
all the copyediting?

02:39.800 --> 02:43.031
-I'm sorry. What?
-Copyediting.

02:43.840 --> 02:45.398
Never mind.

02:45.560 --> 02:46.788
Elaine, you do it.

02:53.880 --> 02:56.633
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld. Pat Cooper
made a reservation for me.

02:56.800 --> 02:59.519
Yes, Mr. Seinfeld,
but all gentlemen are required...

02:59.680 --> 03:01.591
...to wear jackets
in the dining room.

03:01.760 --> 03:03.318
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:03.480 --> 03:05.789
How embarrassing
this must be for you.

03:05.960 --> 03:07.359
You just bought your own dinner.

03:08.200 --> 03:11.112
-No problem. Please, follow me.
-Excuse me.

03:11.560 --> 03:14.472
Funny. Isn't he funny? Funny guy.

03:15.160 --> 03:16.718
Friars.

03:17.560 --> 03:19.755
Hey, not bad.
I kind of like this little thing here.

03:19.920 --> 03:21.558
-It's nice.
-This way, please.

03:21.880 --> 03:24.553
Here we go. Here we go.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.672
Come on.

03:27.840 --> 03:30.400
I'm telling you, I can coach
in the NFL. It's not that hard.

03:30.560 --> 03:32.755
That might be the stupidest thing
you've ever said.

03:32.920 --> 03:34.148
-Get out of here.
-Come on.

03:34.320 --> 03:37.392
No, the stupidest thing was when you
said Steve Kroft from 60 Minutes...

03:37.560 --> 03:38.959
...is the guy from Seals & Croft.

03:39.120 --> 03:41.236
Watch the videos.
I'm telling you, look at them.

03:41.400 --> 03:42.549
Oh, come on.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.511
This is nice.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.111
-Morning.
-Morning?

03:53.280 --> 03:55.271
-Yeah, what time is it?
-Ten-thirty.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.991
See, I got the whole night
ahead of me.

03:58.160 --> 04:01.869
-Boy, that's a nice jacket.
-Oh, I don't believe this.

04:02.040 --> 04:04.395
I forgot to give it back.
It belongs to the Friars Club.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.630
Yeah, I like that crest.

04:06.800 --> 04:08.153
All right.

04:08.320 --> 04:09.514
-Breakfast?
-Oh, yeah.

04:09.680 --> 04:11.352
Most important meal of the day.

04:11.520 --> 04:13.988
-This da Vinci sleep is working?
-I'm percolating, Jerry.

04:14.160 --> 04:18.915
I tell you, I have never felt so fertile.
I'm mossy, Jerry. My brain is mossy.

04:19.079 --> 04:20.274
Listen to this idea;

04:20.440 --> 04:23.000
A restaurant that serves
only peanut butter and jelly.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.152
-What do you call it?
-PB and J's.

04:25.320 --> 04:28.278
-What do you think?
-I think you need more sleep.

04:28.440 --> 04:30.271
So how'd your date
work out with Connie?

04:30.440 --> 04:32.795
I am telling you,
this woman is strange.

04:32.960 --> 04:34.632
She never wants to leave
the apartment.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.791
It's like she doesn't wanna
be seen with me.

04:36.960 --> 04:38.473
-Now you're being ridiculous.
-Yeah.

04:38.640 --> 04:41.712
-No milk?
-Oh, I'll be back.

04:43.000 --> 04:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:57.040 --> 04:58.792
Jerry?

05:00.040 --> 05:01.029
Hey, Jerry.

05:02.640 --> 05:04.073
Come on, buddy.

05:04.240 --> 05:05.229
Kramer.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.834
-Are you awake?
-Why? What time is it?

05:08.000 --> 05:09.638
-It's 4.
-Four in the morning?

05:09.800 --> 05:10.994
Yeah.

05:11.160 --> 05:13.469
-What's wrong with you?
-I'm bored.

05:13.640 --> 05:16.552
All this free time, I don't know what
to do. You wanna do something?

05:16.720 --> 05:19.109
No. Would you just get out?

05:19.280 --> 05:21.635
-Well, you wanna rent a movie?
-No.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.791
Well, what am I gonna do?

05:26.400 --> 05:28.038
-Ready for lunch?
-I'm stuck here...

05:28.200 --> 05:31.556
...editing the stupid catalog
because of stupid Bob Grossberg.

05:32.720 --> 05:35.632
Listen, there's something
really suspicious about this guy.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.917
Every time Mr. Peterman
tries to assign him any work...

05:39.080 --> 05:41.719
...he says he can't hear.
And it all gets dumped on me.

05:41.880 --> 05:43.518
-You think he's faking?
-I don't know.

05:43.680 --> 05:45.750
I'd like to try that earpiece,
see if it's real.

05:45.920 --> 05:47.478
Hey, Elaine.

05:47.800 --> 05:48.949
Oh, you have a friend.

05:50.640 --> 05:52.119
Just wanted to say hi.

05:52.280 --> 05:54.236
Bob, you know what?

05:54.400 --> 05:57.870
I'm kind of swamped here. Could you
give me a hand with the catalog?

05:58.040 --> 06:01.749
-I'm sorry. What?
-I'm kind of swamped.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.156
Thank you.

06:04.760 --> 06:06.990
I'm having lunch with Mr. P.

06:07.680 --> 06:09.671
I better get going.

06:11.720 --> 06:14.314
Did you see that?
Did you see that, Jerry?

06:14.480 --> 06:15.674
-That was him?
-Yes.

06:15.840 --> 06:19.116
-Somehow I thought he'd be taller.
-All right. Listen.

06:19.280 --> 06:21.635
We'll have to do this some other time.
I got work to do.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.279
-See you later.
-All right.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.678
Hey, Bob.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.232
Bob?

06:39.200 --> 06:41.509
Hey, Bobby, over here.

06:41.760 --> 06:43.193
Bob?

06:43.360 --> 06:45.271
Oh, Bob?

06:45.880 --> 06:47.552
Bob?

06:51.280 --> 06:52.838
Hey.

06:54.960 --> 06:56.598
-Elaine.
-Hi.

06:56.760 --> 06:58.159
I was just in the bathroom.

06:58.320 --> 07:00.550
Okay, Jerry, please, please.
I'm really busy here.

07:00.720 --> 07:02.472
No, no. I was in the bathroom
with Bob.

07:02.640 --> 07:05.234
-So what?
-No, I kind of tried to test his hearing.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.436
Get out! What did you do?

07:07.600 --> 07:10.637
I snuck up behind him at the urinal,
tried to see if he could hear me.

07:11.440 --> 07:15.274
-And?
-Well, he flinched sort of.

07:16.280 --> 07:18.032
What do you mean, sort of?
What did he do?

07:18.200 --> 07:20.270
Well, he kind of moved his head,
you know?

07:20.440 --> 07:22.317
But it might have been
on the zip-up.

07:22.680 --> 07:25.274
-So you don't know anything?
-Actually, no.

07:25.440 --> 07:28.113
-All right. Good job.
-Right.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.559
Come in.

07:37.360 --> 07:40.272
Last night, huh? Was that something
or was that something?

07:40.440 --> 07:42.476
-That was something.
-She's great, isn't she?

07:42.640 --> 07:44.392
Fantastic. Fantastic woman.

07:44.560 --> 07:46.994
-I told you.
-I'm nuts about her.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.718
Do you think she could be an it?

07:49.160 --> 07:50.832
-She could be.
-We might have an it!

07:51.400 --> 07:53.516
-"lt" written all over her.
-She's got everything.

07:53.680 --> 07:56.148
She's intelligent, smart,
got a great sense of humor.

07:56.320 --> 07:58.880
-I don't know. I didn't really talk to her.
-She's smart.

07:59.040 --> 08:01.429
-You take my word for it.
-Whatever.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.272
We could be like the Gatsbys.

08:03.440 --> 08:05.749
Didn't they always have
a bunch of people around...

08:05.920 --> 08:07.911
...and they were all best friends?

08:08.080 --> 08:09.911
-That doesn't sound right.
-No.

08:10.080 --> 08:12.548
Tonight she's got tickets
for that show she's working on...

08:12.720 --> 08:15.280
-...The Flying Sandos Brothers.
-Flying Sandos, beautiful.

08:15.440 --> 08:16.634
Great, 7:30, all right?

08:16.800 --> 08:18.472
-Walk me down to the Friars.
-Sure.

08:18.640 --> 08:22.155
So, Jerry, there's an empty apartment
in my building.

08:22.320 --> 08:25.278
If you and Hallie want,
we could try to hold it maybe.

08:26.200 --> 08:27.758
-It's not here.
-What?

08:27.920 --> 08:29.911
The jacket. It's not here.
It's gotta be here.

08:30.960 --> 08:33.110
Oh, boy.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.840
Thanks for that 4 a.m.
wake-up call last night.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.592
Where the hell is that jacket?

08:38.559 --> 08:40.789
-Oh, the one with the crest?
-Yeah.

08:40.960 --> 08:43.793
-That's at the cleaner's.
-The cleaner's? How did it get there?

08:43.960 --> 08:45.439
Well, I borrowed it last night...

08:45.600 --> 08:47.750
-...and it got a little dirty.
-Great.

08:47.920 --> 08:51.993
Somehow I dozed off
and woke up in a pile of garbage.

08:52.160 --> 08:55.755
Somehow? You've had an hour
and 20 minutes sleep in three days.

08:55.920 --> 08:59.230
Well, so look, the cleaner's said
you could pick it up tonight at 6.

08:59.400 --> 09:02.233
All right. I just hope I can get it
to the Friars before the show.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.470
Won't be a problem,
don't worry about it.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.358
Hey.

09:07.920 --> 09:10.434
-Hey!
-Watch out, boy.

09:13.480 --> 09:16.631
Can you give us a hand
with some of these boxes, Bob?

09:18.160 --> 09:19.832
Bob?

09:24.960 --> 09:28.032
I want you so bad, Bob.

09:28.200 --> 09:31.909
You turn me on so much.

09:32.760 --> 09:35.672
You're so damn sexy.

09:36.560 --> 09:38.869
I'm starting to unbutton.

09:39.760 --> 09:42.718
Anything getting through? Bob?

09:46.680 --> 09:50.070
-They perform all over. Europe mostly.
-European tours.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.878
-Sorry. Sorry I'm late.
-Hey, Jerry.

09:52.040 --> 09:54.395
-You're wearing the jacket?
-lt wasn't ready on time.

09:54.560 --> 09:57.120
-I have to return it after the show.
-Sure, sure, sure.

09:57.280 --> 09:59.635
How about these seats?
Are these fantastic, huh?

09:59.800 --> 10:01.074
I feel like Lincoln.

10:01.240 --> 10:03.595
Well, let's hope this evening
turns out a little better.

10:15.360 --> 10:18.511
So are you sure you don't
wanna go to the movies?

10:18.680 --> 10:21.274
No, Cosmo. I like
just being here with you.

10:21.440 --> 10:23.271
Well, it's....

10:23.720 --> 10:26.154
It's a bold adventure, huh?

10:27.200 --> 10:30.397
This is risky business, huh?

10:30.560 --> 10:32.152
I'm all atwitter.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.397
How would you kind people like
to lend me a hand with our next trick?

11:10.560 --> 11:13.597
-I don't think so.
-Please, take off your jacket.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.591
-My jacket?
-Yes, the jacket.

11:15.760 --> 11:18.479
What do you say,
ladies and gentlemen?

11:18.640 --> 11:19.834
You can't argue with that.

11:20.000 --> 11:20.989
-Come on.
-Do it.

11:21.160 --> 11:23.993
-Come on, Jerry. Do it!
-Give him the jacket. Go ahead.

11:24.160 --> 11:26.276
All right.

11:29.400 --> 11:32.949
And now we say
the magic word;

11:34.120 --> 11:35.678
And we make it disappear.

11:42.800 --> 11:45.030
Oh, Cosmo.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.758
Cosmo.

11:46.920 --> 11:48.797
Oh, Cosmo.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.756
Honey, can you move a little?
This hurts.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.950
Cosmo?

11:56.280 --> 11:58.077
Oh, my God. Cosmo, wake up.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.431
Cosmo?

12:02.600 --> 12:05.910
Oh, my God. He's dead.

12:06.080 --> 12:07.911
He's dead.

12:15.600 --> 12:18.478
Yeah, Tommy, this is Connie.
You gotta help me.

12:18.640 --> 12:21.279
Some guy dropped dead
on top of me.

12:21.440 --> 12:25.069
I can't call the cops
because Joey might find out.

12:25.880 --> 12:29.589
I can't. I'm stuck.
You gotta help me.

12:36.800 --> 12:39.997
This is very exciting.
The inner sanctum here.

12:42.080 --> 12:44.514
Hi, I was in the audience earlier.
You threw my jacket.

12:44.680 --> 12:47.319
-I just wanted to pick it up.
-Jacket?

12:47.480 --> 12:49.755
-What jacket?
-I had a jacket with a crest on it.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.911
You came into the audience,
you threw it away.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.193
Are you sure it was me?

12:55.360 --> 12:59.239
-lt was you or one of your brothers.
-Well, two of them have left already.

13:04.040 --> 13:05.519
-No.
-lt doesn't even belong to me.

13:05.680 --> 13:08.990
-lt belongs to the Friars Club.
-Sorry.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.719
-Jerry, I'm sure it'll turn up.
-I'm sure it won't.

13:12.880 --> 13:14.711
Don't worry. I'll get the jacket back.

13:14.880 --> 13:16.996
There you go.
She's gonna get the jacket back.

13:17.160 --> 13:19.151
So let's go get some coffee, huh?

13:19.560 --> 13:22.552
-I'm a little tired. I think I'll go home.
-Oh, that's too bad.

13:22.720 --> 13:23.994
Yeah, we'll do it another time.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.311
George, we'll go.

13:43.960 --> 13:46.030
Broke a shoelace today.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.679
I can get you shoelaces tomorrow.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.519
Okay.

13:53.280 --> 13:55.271
So, what color?

13:56.440 --> 13:58.032
Brown.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.319
Maybe a black.

14:01.480 --> 14:04.995
-More coffee?
-No, check. Please.

14:15.800 --> 14:18.712
That nut is always up to something.

15:00.360 --> 15:03.033
Hey! Hey!

15:05.440 --> 15:07.510
Mama!

15:09.600 --> 15:11.397
No!

15:11.560 --> 15:12.959
Help!

15:13.120 --> 15:14.633
Help!

15:16.440 --> 15:21.230
Elaine, I think I've been working you
a little too hard lately.

15:22.040 --> 15:27.512
So I have two tickets for you to The
Flying Sandos Brothers magic show.

15:27.680 --> 15:29.750
It is a real hoot.

15:29.920 --> 15:32.673
-Well, thank you, Mr. Peterman.
-The tickets are for tonight...

15:32.840 --> 15:36.958
...so you and Bob can knock off
a little early so you both can get ready.

15:38.080 --> 15:39.798
Mr. Peterman, you--

15:39.960 --> 15:41.916
There's no need to deny it, Elaine.

15:42.080 --> 15:44.150
I heard every word you said.

15:44.680 --> 15:47.274
And I know you wouldn't be
just having fun with his handicap.

15:47.720 --> 15:51.998
That kind of cruelty
would be grounds for dismissal.

15:52.440 --> 15:54.396
Of course, Mr. Peterman.

15:54.800 --> 15:57.189
Tell him I'll come down
and talk to him. Okay. Bye.

15:58.400 --> 15:59.913
Well, that was the Friars Club.

16:00.080 --> 16:02.878
Think they're gonna let
a jacket stealer join? I don't think so.

16:03.040 --> 16:05.031
They're gonna charge me
$800 for the jacket...

16:05.200 --> 16:06.713
...and I gotta deal with Pat Cooper.

16:06.880 --> 16:08.791
What kind of show
is that Sandos Brothers?

16:09.200 --> 16:12.431
They take your jacket and just
throw it? I never heard of that.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.352
It was a little unusual.

16:14.520 --> 16:17.671
So Susan and I were thinking dinner
at our house Saturday night.

16:17.840 --> 16:20.434
-Just the four of us.
-No, I don't think so.

16:21.040 --> 16:23.679
-Why not?
-I don't know. I'm a little turned off.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.311
Come on,
what are you talking about?

16:26.480 --> 16:28.471
I'm.... I'm kind of soured.

16:28.640 --> 16:30.119
-You're soured?
-Yeah, I'm soured.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.111
-Don't be soured.
-I'm sorry. I'm soured.

16:32.280 --> 16:34.032
Are you kidding?
We were getting along.

16:34.200 --> 16:35.428
Where is this coming from?

16:35.600 --> 16:38.160
Frankly, I didn't think she was
concerned about my jacket.

16:38.320 --> 16:40.754
What are you talking about?
She's very concerned.

16:40.920 --> 16:43.957
-She said she was gonna get it back.
-Yeah, we'll see.

16:44.120 --> 16:46.634
If she gets it back, then you'll have
no reason to be sour.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.119
You'll de-sour, right?

16:48.960 --> 16:51.190
-I'll try and de-sour.
-That's not good enough.

16:51.360 --> 16:53.749
You don't try and de-sour.
You have to sweeten too.

16:53.920 --> 16:56.559
I'll try. I'll try and de-sour
and sweeten.

16:57.240 --> 16:59.310
I wanna get it back
to when we were the Gatsbys.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.072
-I still don't know what that means.
-Yeah.

17:04.319 --> 17:05.719
God.

17:05.880 --> 17:09.316
-Oh, my God, what happened to you?
-She tried to kill me, Jerry.

17:09.720 --> 17:11.118
-Who?
-Connie!

17:11.280 --> 17:13.555
-What did she do?
-I don't know.

17:13.720 --> 17:16.791
But I woke up
in the Hudson River in a sack!

17:17.920 --> 17:21.037
I think she drugged me. But she's
a murderer, and I'm calling the cops.

17:21.200 --> 17:22.553
Why would she try and kill you?

17:22.720 --> 17:26.679
Well, isn't it obvious? She doesn't
want anybody else to have me.

17:30.560 --> 17:33.279
-Hey, there's Uncle Miltie.
-Yeah, it is.

17:33.440 --> 17:34.714
And there's David Steinberg.

17:34.880 --> 17:37.758
-The comedian or the manager?
-The manager.

17:38.440 --> 17:39.839
Hey, there's Pat. Hey, Pat.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.116
What went wrong?
What's the matter with you?

17:42.280 --> 17:45.192
-What, are you a kleptomaniac?
-I forgot to take it off.

17:45.360 --> 17:46.839
You forgot to take it off?

17:47.000 --> 17:51.039
Oh, you go into a department store,
you put a suit on and walk right out.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.236
-What, are you some sort of an idiot?
-I'm sorry.

17:53.400 --> 17:55.630
-Where's the jacket?
-One of the Gypsies took it.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.028
Oh, the Gypsies took it.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.111
Of course,
New York has a lot of Gypsies.

17:59.280 --> 18:02.192
-On every block, there's a Gypsy.
-Well, it's true. I saw it.

18:02.360 --> 18:04.749
Excuse me, are you an entertainer?

18:04.920 --> 18:07.354
-Are you in show business?
-No, l--

18:07.520 --> 18:10.512
Then what am I talking to you for?
Bring the jacket back tomorrow.

18:10.680 --> 18:12.272
All right.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.789
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Look at that guy.

18:16.960 --> 18:19.520
Isn't that guy from the show?
He's wearing the jacket.

18:21.120 --> 18:23.839
-Oh, my God. You're right.
-Come on.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.639
Wait a second.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.756
-Are you members?
-I'm a prospective member.

18:28.920 --> 18:31.150
Until then, that's the way out.

18:31.320 --> 18:32.833
-That guy has my jacket.
-Let's go.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.230
Excuse me. The guy is wearing
a jacket that my--

18:35.400 --> 18:36.389
-Come on.
-Let's go.

18:36.560 --> 18:38.039
-lf I could talk to the guy--
-Hey!

18:38.720 --> 18:40.915
These seats are fantastic.

18:41.080 --> 18:43.548
It was nice of Mr. Peterman
to give us these tickets.

18:43.720 --> 18:46.314
Yeah. Yeah, it was nice.

18:47.840 --> 18:49.432
Yeah...

18:50.320 --> 18:53.676
...we got our own little private box
here, don't we?

18:56.000 --> 18:57.752
Get off of me. Stop it.

18:57.920 --> 19:00.798
Stop it. Get off of me!

19:04.040 --> 19:08.113
Get ahold of yourself!
Bob, get ahold of yourself!

19:19.400 --> 19:21.391
I don't know how that guy
gave us the slip.

19:21.560 --> 19:22.879
He probably went out the back.

19:25.720 --> 19:27.517
Hey, it's you.

19:27.680 --> 19:30.638
-That's my Friars Club jacket.
-No, it is not. This is my jacket.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.997
No, no, that's my jacket. Give it back.
Come on. I need this jacket.

19:34.600 --> 19:37.114
I wanna join.
I need it to become a member.

19:37.280 --> 19:38.633
Help! Help!

19:40.520 --> 19:42.476
What is he yelling about?
They're stealing.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.312
I can't believe it.

19:44.480 --> 19:46.550
-Hey, George, you know what?
-What?

19:46.720 --> 19:49.188
I think this crest is different.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.357
It's got a moose on it.

19:52.160 --> 19:54.993
-Moose?
-Yeah.

19:55.360 --> 19:58.557
-I don't think this is the jacket.
-No, it's not.

20:01.040 --> 20:02.234
This is the jacket.

20:04.320 --> 20:08.313
She got the jacket back. Thank you.

20:08.480 --> 20:11.995
It got dirty, so they wanted to clean it
before they gave it back to you.

20:12.160 --> 20:13.878
-That's nice of them.
-That is nice.

20:14.040 --> 20:15.917
-This is nice.
-Yeah.

20:16.080 --> 20:18.833
Let's call Susan.
We'll go have coffee.

20:19.440 --> 20:21.396
I'll see you at the wedding.

20:41.680 --> 20:43.432
Great. Now she's sour.

20:43.600 --> 20:46.068
-Maybe she'll sweeten.
-She won't sweeten. And I'm bitter.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.432
There they are!

20:48.600 --> 20:50.556
Here. Here, we'll leave it
there for you.

21:12.400 --> 21:13.594
That's her, officer.

21:13.760 --> 21:15.478
Kramer. Oh, my God.
I thought you were--

21:15.640 --> 21:18.313
What, sleeping with the fishes?
I guess I woke up.

21:18.480 --> 21:21.517
You're under arrest for the
attempted murder of Cosmo Kramer.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.636
-I didn't do anything.
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.

21:23.800 --> 21:26.837
-Get your coat. We gotta take you in.
-Can I call my lawyer?

21:27.000 --> 21:28.877
Okay. Go ahead.

21:32.640 --> 21:35.996
Meet me at the police station. They're
arresting me for attempted murder.

21:36.160 --> 21:39.197
-Attempted murder? Of who?
-This guy, Kramer.

21:40.360 --> 21:42.635
-Cosmo Kramer?
-Yeah, that's right.

21:42.800 --> 21:45.109
I don't want nothing to do with it.
