WEBVTT

00:01.305 --> 00:02.263
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:02.306 --> 00:04.265
Clarke: AND WHAT IS THIS?

00:04.308 --> 00:06.006
THIS IS HOW
WE MAKE HOSTS.

00:06.049 --> 00:07.050
BONE MARROW?

00:09.357 --> 00:11.054
Octavia: YOU'’RE
STOPPING HER HEART?

00:11.098 --> 00:12.055
Gabriel: DEATH
CAUSES HER MIND

00:12.099 --> 00:13.535
TO BACK UP
ONTO THE DRIVE.

00:13.578 --> 00:14.579
I TAKE IT OUT.

00:14.623 --> 00:15.928
WE GET
CLARKE BACK.

00:15.972 --> 00:17.191
WHY ISN'’T SHE
WAKING UP?

00:19.367 --> 00:21.021
CLARKE?

00:21.064 --> 00:22.370
THE RED SUN
TOXIN'’S EVERYWHERE.

00:22.413 --> 00:24.067
-YOU WEAPONIZED IT.
-SIMONE DID.

00:24.111 --> 00:25.938
IT WAS PART OF OUR
ADJUSTMENT PROTOCOL.

00:25.982 --> 00:27.070
RELEASING IT
IN THE WATER

00:27.114 --> 00:28.158
WILL TRIGGER
AN EVACUATION

00:28.202 --> 00:29.725
WITHOUT INDUCING
A MASS PSYCHOSIS.

00:29.768 --> 00:32.249
WE'’LL NEED TO BE INSIDE
BEFORE IT STARTS,

00:32.293 --> 00:34.773
WHICH MEANS...I GO
AS JOSEPHINE.

00:36.819 --> 00:40.910
Russell: AFTER THE EXECUTION,
WE FOUND MORE GRAFFITI.

00:40.953 --> 00:45.262
WHO KNOWS WHAT POISON THOSE
ESCAPED PRISONERS ARE SPREADING.

00:45.306 --> 00:47.656
ONE OF THEM ALREADY
KILLED SIMONE.

00:47.699 --> 00:51.225
IF THIS CONTINUES, THEY ARE
GOING TO COME FOR US.

00:51.268 --> 00:53.575
RIGHT NOW, THEIR REBELLION

00:53.618 --> 00:56.186
IS AT A TIPPING POINT.

00:56.230 --> 00:59.276
MUST CRUSH IT TONIGHT.

00:59.320 --> 01:00.669
GET EVERYTHING BACK TO NORMAL.

01:03.280 --> 01:05.108
WHEN OUR PEOPLE SEE
ALL OF US RETURNED AT ONCE,

01:05.152 --> 01:06.675
THEY WILL FALL TO THEIR KNEES.

01:07.763 --> 01:10.287
Madi: WE SHOULD'’VE
KILLED YOU FIRST.

01:12.202 --> 01:17.816
ONCE WE'’RE FREE,
YOU WILL BURN.

01:20.210 --> 01:22.082
WELL, THAT'’S
A LITTLE DRAMATIC.

01:24.214 --> 01:28.044
UHH! YOU WILL
ALL BURN!

01:28.088 --> 01:30.307
YOU WILL NOT
GET RID OF US!

01:30.351 --> 01:33.180
WE ARE ETERNAL!

01:33.223 --> 01:34.746
Russell: GUARDS,

01:34.790 --> 01:36.052
BRING THE DOCTORS.

01:37.314 --> 01:38.272
STAY STILL.

01:42.189 --> 01:43.320
Man: SHE'’LL TEAR OUT THE IVS.

01:43.364 --> 01:44.713
WE HAVE TO TAKE HER AGAIN.

01:47.324 --> 01:49.065
I KNOW WHAT YOU'’RE
DOING, REYES.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.153
YOU THINK YOU'’RE
SMART ENOUGH

01:50.197 --> 01:51.502
TO GET RID OF ME?

01:51.546 --> 01:55.158
IF YOU DON'’T STOP,
I WILL KILL THIS CHILD.

02:05.299 --> 02:06.691
THAT'’S BETTER.
THANK YOU.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.958
THERE.

02:13.002 --> 02:14.134
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

02:20.401 --> 02:21.793
PEACHY KEEN JOSEPHINE.

02:27.451 --> 02:29.279
OH, STOP IT.
I'’M NOT HER.

02:34.328 --> 02:36.330
I WILL KILL YOU
FOR THIS.

02:40.290 --> 02:41.857
I ONCE BELIEVED THAT
I WOULD NEVER

02:41.900 --> 02:43.598
STRAY FROM
THE MORAL PATH,

02:43.641 --> 02:47.297
AND THEN I KILLED MY FAMILY
IN THE FIRST ECLIPSE.

02:47.341 --> 02:49.691
I'’D HAVE DONE ANYTHING
TO BRING THEM BACK.

02:52.346 --> 02:53.564
SO I BELIEVE YOU.

03:00.267 --> 03:02.225
HOW MANY DOSES OF
THE SERUM DO YOU HAVE?

03:02.269 --> 03:04.401
4, INCLUDING
THE ONE YOUR PEOPLE

03:04.445 --> 03:07.230
TOOK TO THE MACHINE SHOP
FOR SIMONE.

03:07.274 --> 03:09.189
6 PRIMES MUST BE
RESURRECTED TONIGHT.

03:09.232 --> 03:10.320
THAT'’S TWO MORE DOSES.

03:10.364 --> 03:12.540
MADI WOULDN'’T
SURVIVE THAT.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.150
Russell: IF IT'’S
TOO HARD FOR YOU
TO CONTINUE,

03:14.194 --> 03:15.456
MY HEALERS WILL
TAKE YOUR PLACE.

03:15.499 --> 03:18.285
THEY'’RE ALREADY FAMILIAR
WITH THE PROCESS.

03:18.328 --> 03:20.025
IT WOULD BE NO TROUBLE.

03:20.069 --> 03:21.375
NO. I CAN DO IT.

03:21.418 --> 03:23.420
GOOD. REMEMBER,
THIS WAS THE DEAL

03:23.464 --> 03:24.639
THAT SAVED YOU
FROM THE PYRE.

03:26.641 --> 03:28.295
I'’D HATE FOR THAT
TO CHANGE.

03:36.868 --> 03:38.305
TOODLE-LOO.

04:57.688 --> 04:59.342
Octavia: WHAT
DO WE DO NOW?

04:59.386 --> 05:00.300
Bellamy: NOW WE WAIT.

05:02.214 --> 05:03.303
CLARKE WILL
GET IT DOWN.

05:06.088 --> 05:07.350
Bellamy: YOU.

05:07.394 --> 05:08.438
YOU CAN GO IN AND HELP HER.

05:08.482 --> 05:09.700
Octavia: HOW, BELL?

05:09.744 --> 05:11.441
THEY KNOW WHAT HE
LOOKS LIKE FROM JADE.

05:11.485 --> 05:13.051
BESIDES, IT'’S
NOT THE PLAN.

05:24.759 --> 05:27.675
Bellamy: EVERYONE, STAND DOWN.
STAY LOW.

05:27.718 --> 05:29.546
OUT OF SIGHT OF
THE HOURLY PATROLS.

05:32.723 --> 05:34.638
I LEFT THEM.

05:34.682 --> 05:36.553
AND THAT'’S WHY
THEY'’RE STILL ALIVE.

05:36.597 --> 05:38.163
YOU DON'’T KNOW THAT.

05:38.207 --> 05:39.208
YOU HEARD MURPHY.

05:39.251 --> 05:40.383
ECHO'’S IN TROUBLE.

05:40.427 --> 05:43.604
ECHO'’S STRONG.
SHE'’LL BE OK.

05:43.647 --> 05:45.562
EVERYBODY ALWAYS
THINKS THAT.

05:45.606 --> 05:48.217
HELL, I DO IT, TOO.

05:48.260 --> 05:52.177
THE TRUTH IS...
YOU'’RE FINE UNTIL
YOU'’RE NOT.

05:52.221 --> 05:53.788
AND MURPHY SAID
HE'’D HELP.

05:53.831 --> 05:54.745
REAL COMFORTING.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.710
HAVE SOME FAITH.

06:11.283 --> 06:12.459
ENJOY.

06:14.765 --> 06:16.680
COME ON.
YOU KNOW YOU WANT
SOME OF THIS.

06:19.509 --> 06:22.251
THEY TIED US
TO STAKES, JOHN.

06:22.294 --> 06:24.166
THEY WERE GONNA
BURN US ALIVE.

06:24.209 --> 06:26.429
AND YOU STILL WANT
TO PLAY HOUSE
WITH THEM?

06:26.473 --> 06:27.691
WHAT ABOUT OUR FRIENDS?

06:27.735 --> 06:29.911
THIS IS HOW
WE SAVE THEM.

06:29.954 --> 06:31.826
THINK ABOUT IT.
EVERYONE'’S JUST
TRYING TO SURVIVE,

06:31.869 --> 06:33.523
EVEN RUSSELL.

06:33.567 --> 06:34.655
WE JUST NEED
TO MAKE HIM SEE

06:34.698 --> 06:35.656
THAT IT'’S IN HIS
BEST INTEREST

06:35.699 --> 06:38.615
TO KEEP ALL
OF US ALIVE.

06:38.659 --> 06:41.401
IN OUR CASE, FOREVER.

06:42.489 --> 06:43.577
Russell: YOU MUST
BE STARVING.

06:43.620 --> 06:44.665
LET'’S GET YOU
SOMETHING TO EAT.

06:44.708 --> 06:45.579
AFTER THAT, I NEED
YOU TO HANDLE

06:45.622 --> 06:47.668
THE NAMING DAY
PREPARATIONS.

06:47.711 --> 06:49.452
Clarke: I'’M NOT HUNGRY
AND I JUST GOT BACK.

06:49.496 --> 06:50.453
GET PRIYA TO DO IT.

06:51.802 --> 06:53.630
SHE'’S AN ENGINEER,
NOT A PARTY PLANNER.

06:53.674 --> 06:56.459
HAVE YOU BEEN TO
ONE OF MY PARTIES?

06:56.503 --> 06:58.374
FINE. I'’LL GET
PRIYA TO DO IT.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.767
GOOD. NOW,

06:59.810 --> 07:01.899
IF I SPEND ONE MORE
MINUTE LIKE THIS,

07:01.943 --> 07:04.554
I WILL SPONTANEOUSLY
COMBUST FROM THE SHAME.

07:04.598 --> 07:07.078
GO GET CLEANED UP.
I'’LL RESURRECT
YOUR MOTHER.

07:07.122 --> 07:08.558
WAIT.

07:08.602 --> 07:11.082
DOES THAT MEAN
ECHO'’S STILL ALIVE?

07:11.126 --> 07:13.607
WHAT SHE'’S SAYING IS

07:13.650 --> 07:14.825
NOW THAT ANYONE CAN BE
A NIGHTBLOOD,

07:14.869 --> 07:17.524
MAYBE YOU USE
SOMEONE ELSE?

07:17.567 --> 07:19.700
OH, STOP YOUR WHINING.

07:19.743 --> 07:21.745
DO YOU WANT TO BE
IMMORTAL OR NOT?

07:21.789 --> 07:23.355
BECAUSE IF
YOU BECOME PRIMES

07:23.399 --> 07:25.662
AND THIS
REVOLUTION SPREADS,

07:25.706 --> 07:27.185
THEY'’RE COMING
FOR YOU, TOO.

07:31.059 --> 07:34.671
HEY, I WANT TO BE THERE
WHEN MOM COMES BACK.

07:34.715 --> 07:36.673
WAIT FOR ME?

07:36.717 --> 07:38.196
OF COURSE, SWEETHEART.
BE QUICK.

07:43.985 --> 07:47.641
I ADMIRE YOUR LOYALTY
TO YOUR FRIENDS,

07:47.684 --> 07:49.599
BUT I NEED TO KNOW IF
YOU'’RE STILL WITH US.

07:49.643 --> 07:51.514
OF COURSE WE ARE.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.124
ABSOLUTELY.

07:57.215 --> 07:59.174
STILL, YOU SHOULD KNOW
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS

07:59.217 --> 08:01.655
TO ME OR MY FAMILY,
MY GUARDS HAVE ORDERS--

08:01.698 --> 08:05.746
ENOUGH SAID.
WE'’RE IN.

08:05.789 --> 08:07.704
GOOD.

08:07.748 --> 08:10.228
NOW LET ME TELL YOU
ABOUT YOUR NEW IDENTITIES.

08:12.404 --> 08:13.667
THANK YOU.

08:16.887 --> 08:19.760
Jackson: SHE'’S TOO WEAK FOR
ANOTHER BONE MARROW EXTRACTION.

08:19.803 --> 08:22.545
HOW CLOSE ARE YOU
TO REMOVING SHEIDHEDA?

08:22.589 --> 08:23.764
I'’M TRYING, BUT
WITHOUT THE NOTEBOOK,

08:23.807 --> 08:25.592
I--I CAN'’T GET
PAST THAT AI.

08:25.635 --> 08:26.549
SHE SAID IF
YOU DON'’T STOP,

08:26.593 --> 08:27.811
THE CHILD WILL DIE.

08:27.855 --> 08:29.030
I HEARD HER.

08:29.073 --> 08:31.641
SO EITHER HE KILLS HER,
OR RUSSELL DOES?

08:31.685 --> 08:33.208
Abby: I'’LL WORRY
ABOUT RUSSELL.

08:33.251 --> 08:34.165
ABBY!

08:36.603 --> 08:37.952
WE'’LL TAKE THE DOSES FROM ME.

08:43.174 --> 08:44.524
RAVEN, KEEP TRYING.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.093
JACKSON, WE CAN
DO THIS.

08:49.137 --> 08:50.181
I'’LL BE FINE.

08:50.225 --> 08:52.793
NONE OF THIS IS FINE.

08:52.836 --> 08:55.317
LOOK AT ME.
I KNOW IT'’S HARD.

08:55.360 --> 08:56.753
WE DON'’T HAVE
A CHOICE.

08:58.842 --> 09:00.583
SAID BY EVERY
WAR CRIMINAL EVER.

09:02.759 --> 09:04.544
I SHOULDN'’T HAVE
SAID THAT TO YOU.

09:06.328 --> 09:08.635
YOU'’RE A GOOD
MAN, ERIC.

09:10.071 --> 09:11.333
AM I?

09:14.205 --> 09:16.077
THIS BONE MARROW

09:16.120 --> 09:17.687
LETS THEM KILL
MORE INNOCENT PEOPLE

09:17.731 --> 09:19.820
SO THAT OUR PEOPLE
CAN LIVE.

09:24.651 --> 09:27.218
LIKE MARCUS SAID...

09:27.262 --> 09:29.960
"WE TURN THE PAGE.

09:30.004 --> 09:32.963
WE DO BETTER TODAY
THAN WE DID YESTERDAY."

09:58.032 --> 09:59.555
CLARKE?

10:11.698 --> 10:14.396
HA HA!
WHAT HAPPENED?

10:14.439 --> 10:17.094
I THOUGHT...HOW?

10:17.138 --> 10:23.013
IT'’S
A LONG STORY.

10:23.057 --> 10:23.971
BUT I'’M OK.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.420
IT'’S THE FLAME.

10:38.463 --> 10:39.769
SHEIDHEDA.

10:39.813 --> 10:41.379
Raven: I'’M WORKING
THE PROBLEM,

10:41.423 --> 10:43.033
BUT I NEED
BECCA'’S BOOK.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.692
OK.

10:49.736 --> 10:53.391
THAT CAN WAIT.
WE DON'’T HAVE MUCH TIME.

10:53.435 --> 10:54.784
I NEED YOU TO
COME WITH ME.

10:56.438 --> 10:57.700
WE HAVE TO LOWER
THE SHIELD.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.049
BELLAMY AND OCTAVIA
ARE WAITING

10:59.093 --> 11:00.790
WITH THE CHILDREN
OF GABRIEL.

11:02.226 --> 11:04.446
CLARKE, I CAN'’T
GO WITH YOU.

11:04.489 --> 11:05.752
IF SHE
WAKES UP AGAIN,

11:05.795 --> 11:08.493
SHEIDHEDA WILL
KILL HER.

11:08.537 --> 11:10.887
OK. I'’LL USE RYKER.

11:10.931 --> 11:12.541
THE REACTOR'’S BENEATH
THE MACHINE SHOP ANYWAY.

11:12.584 --> 11:16.153
NO. RYKER TURNED ECHO IN.
HE WON'’T HELP YOU.

11:16.197 --> 11:17.720
NO,

11:17.764 --> 11:19.896
BUT JOSEPHINE CAN BE
VERY PERSUASIVE.

11:24.945 --> 11:26.816
UNTIL THEN,
PROMISE ME
YOU WON'’T

11:26.860 --> 11:28.644
TAKE ANY MORE
BONE MARROW.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.037
THAT'’S NOT
A PROBLEM NOW.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.908
THERE'’S ANOTHER NIGHTBLOOD
IN THE FAMILY.

11:33.736 --> 11:35.346
Clarke: MOM.
Abby: SHH.

11:37.044 --> 11:39.524
I WON'’T LET THEM
TAKE HER.

11:39.568 --> 11:41.091
LIKE MOTHER,
LIKE DAUGHTER.

11:44.355 --> 11:45.705
I LOVE YOU.

11:45.748 --> 11:48.272
I LOVE YOU,
TOO, CLARKE.

11:48.316 --> 11:50.927
NOW GO SAVE US ALL...

11:50.971 --> 11:53.147
AGAIN.

12:17.258 --> 12:18.781
RYKER?

13:00.562 --> 13:03.565
IF YOU CAN'’T HELP ME,
MAYBE YOUR MOM WILL.

13:10.006 --> 13:11.921
Man: OPEN IT UP.
Second man: YES, SIR.

13:18.319 --> 13:20.016
THERE YOU ARE.

13:20.060 --> 13:21.322
JADE SAID YOU'’D
FALLEN ASLEEP.

13:21.365 --> 13:24.151
I WOULD NEVER MISS
MOM'’S RESURRECTION.

13:24.194 --> 13:28.024
UNFORTUNATELY,
ECHO HAD OTHER PLANS.

13:37.120 --> 13:40.167
THERE ARE 3 ESCAPED KILLERS
IN THIS COMPOUND NOW.

13:40.210 --> 13:42.865
YOUR ORDERS ARE
TO SHOOT TO KILL.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.301
IS THAT CLEAR?

13:44.345 --> 13:45.912
YES, HOLINESS.

13:45.955 --> 13:47.435
THEY TOOK HIS DRIVE.

13:47.478 --> 13:48.871
WE HAVE TO GET IT
BACK BEFORE TONIGHT

13:48.915 --> 13:51.569
SO WE CAN BRING RYKER
BACK WITH THE OTHERS.

13:51.613 --> 13:52.744
I'’LL HANDLE IT.

13:52.788 --> 13:54.877
YOU'’VE GOT ENOUGH
ON YOUR PLATE.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.705
GET THE BODY
OUT OF HERE,

13:56.748 --> 13:58.054
AND CLEAN UP
THIS MESS.

14:02.276 --> 14:04.147
I'’LL GET PRIYA
TO HELP ME.

14:04.191 --> 14:05.583
LORD KNOWS SHE'’LL
BE MOTIVATED

14:05.627 --> 14:06.933
TO SAVE HER SON.

14:06.976 --> 14:08.717
GOOD. BRING
THE DRIVE TO THE LAB

14:08.760 --> 14:10.066
WHEN YOU GET IT.

14:10.110 --> 14:11.633
I'’LL START
THE OTHER RESURRECTIONS.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.157
YOU WILL TAKE GUARDS.

14:29.694 --> 14:30.739
DAMN IT!

14:30.782 --> 14:32.132
FLAME BOOTED ME
AGAIN.

14:32.175 --> 14:33.220
IT'’S WEIRD.

14:33.263 --> 14:34.482
IT'’S ALMOST LIKE THE AI

14:34.525 --> 14:35.918
IS PROTECTING SHEIDHEDA.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.138
SOMEONE'’S COMING.

14:48.017 --> 14:49.279
Russell: THAT'’S ENOUGH.

14:53.066 --> 14:54.502
WHAT IS THIS?

14:54.545 --> 14:55.633
THESE ARE THE HOSTS.

15:04.816 --> 15:06.644
YOU DEFIED ME.

15:06.688 --> 15:08.385
I GOT YOU
YOUR DOSES.

15:10.257 --> 15:11.736
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE

15:11.780 --> 15:12.999
WHO THEY CAME FROM?

15:18.004 --> 15:21.311
YOU'’RE RIGHT.
IT DOESN'’T.

15:21.355 --> 15:23.574
GET THESE PEOPLE
OUT OF THE LAB.

15:23.618 --> 15:25.185
I HAVE WORK TO DO.

15:36.022 --> 15:37.545
Man: .

15:37.588 --> 15:39.416
SECTOR D IS ALL CLEAR.

15:39.460 --> 15:42.158
YOU'’RE FREE TO HEAD BACK TO
SANCTUM WITH THE PRIMES.

15:42.202 --> 15:43.768
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA
MISS THE NAMINGS.

15:43.812 --> 15:46.032
CHECK SECTOR H WHEN WE GET BACK.

15:46.075 --> 15:47.424
WE CAN'’T TAKE ANY CHANCES TODAY.

15:49.165 --> 15:51.080
NAMING DAY?

15:51.124 --> 15:53.909
THEY SAID "NAMINGS."
PLURAL.

16:02.657 --> 16:03.571
GABRIEL?

16:10.273 --> 16:11.666
CRAZY SUICIDERS.

16:16.366 --> 16:18.325
Octavia: GABRIEL,
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

16:18.368 --> 16:20.327
-GABRIEL?
-YOU SAID "NAMINGS."

16:20.370 --> 16:22.503
HOW MANY?
WHO'’S COMING BACK?

16:22.546 --> 16:23.634
I DON'’T KNOW.

16:23.678 --> 16:24.635
ALL OF THEM,
I THINK.

16:26.115 --> 16:27.029
AAH!

16:28.900 --> 16:30.511
I CAN'’T HAVE RUSSELL
MURDER MORE INNOCENT PEOPLE.

16:30.554 --> 16:32.165
I KNOW IT'’S HARD
BUT WE HAVE TO

16:32.208 --> 16:33.296
STICK TO THE PLAN!

16:33.340 --> 16:34.906
CLARKE GETS
THE SHIELD DOWN

16:34.950 --> 16:36.517
AND WE USE THE TOXIN
AS A DISTRACTION

16:36.560 --> 16:38.214
TO SAVE OUR PEOPLE.

16:38.258 --> 16:39.650
YEAH, WELL,
I HAVE A NEW PLAN:

16:39.694 --> 16:41.696
USE OUR DISTRACTION
TO STOP NAMING DAY.

16:44.133 --> 16:46.309
LOOK, I'’M SORRY,
BUT UNLIKE YOU,

16:46.353 --> 16:48.442
I CAN'’T SACRIFICE
THE FEW TO SAVE
THE MANY.

17:07.809 --> 17:09.593
WHAT IS TAKING SO LONG?

17:09.637 --> 17:11.769
SHOULD'’VE BEEN DELIVERED
TO THE PALACE ALREADY.

17:14.642 --> 17:16.818
OH, MY FAVORITE.

17:16.861 --> 17:17.906
ARE YOU SURE
YOU DON'’T WANT

17:17.949 --> 17:19.473
A JO BERRY PIE?

17:23.129 --> 17:24.434
Priya: I HATE
JO BERRY PIE.

17:26.132 --> 17:27.568
IT WAS
DELILAH'’S FAVORITE.

17:27.611 --> 17:30.049
Blythe Ann: TRY THESE,
FRESH OUT OF THE OVEN.

17:32.442 --> 17:34.444
YOU'’VE DONE
DELILAH PROUD.

17:40.320 --> 17:41.190
PRIYA.
THERE YOU ARE.

17:41.234 --> 17:42.757
I'’VE BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER.

17:42.800 --> 17:45.238
Priya: JOSIE.
I HEARD YOU HAD
QUITE THE ADVENTURE.

17:45.281 --> 17:47.240
YOU HAVE NO IDEA,
AND I'’LL TELL YOU
ALL ABOUT IT,

17:47.283 --> 17:48.719
BUT FIRST I NEED
YOUR HELP WITH SOMETHING

17:48.763 --> 17:49.720
IN THE MACHINE SHOP.

17:49.764 --> 17:50.634
WHAT DID RYKER DO NOW?

17:50.678 --> 17:52.636
MORE LIKE
WHAT DIDN'’T HE DO.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.290
DAD ASKED HIM TO WIPE
ONE OF THE PRISONERS,

17:54.334 --> 17:56.336
BUT HE'’S COMPLETELY
LOST HIS NERVE.

17:56.379 --> 17:57.424
IT'’S EMBARRASSING.

17:57.467 --> 17:58.512
HE'’S NEVER
WANTED TO FACE

17:58.555 --> 18:01.080
THE REALITY OF
OUR SITUATION.

18:01.123 --> 18:03.038
LET'’S GO.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.387
WE CAN'’T LET THEM LEAVE.

18:06.824 --> 18:08.174
AAH!

18:16.312 --> 18:17.444
OHH!

18:17.487 --> 18:18.793
Priya: JOSEPHINE,
COME ON.

18:18.836 --> 18:19.837
Both: UHH!

18:27.454 --> 18:29.151
I KNEW IT.

18:29.195 --> 18:30.326
RYKER DIDN'’T LOSE
HIS NERVE,

18:30.370 --> 18:31.284
HE LOST HIS LIFE.

18:35.505 --> 18:36.419
CLARKE.

18:41.207 --> 18:42.382
HAVE YOU SEEN MADI?

18:43.861 --> 18:46.255
HOW--HOW ARE YOU HERE?

18:46.299 --> 18:47.648
LOOK, I'’LL
EXPLAIN LATER.

18:47.691 --> 18:49.476
FIRST WE NEED TO
LOWER THE SHIELD.

18:51.434 --> 18:52.783
BELLAMY'’S OUT THERE.

18:52.827 --> 18:53.871
WITH THE CAVALRY.

18:55.221 --> 18:56.178
I'’LL GET PRIYA
TO HELP ME

18:56.222 --> 18:57.484
TAKE DOWN
THE REACTOR,

18:57.527 --> 18:58.963
AND THEN WE
GO AFTER MADI.

19:13.978 --> 19:18.331
THEY KEEP THE BONES OF
ALL THEIR HOSTS LIKE TROPHIES.

19:18.374 --> 19:20.333
THEY'’RE SERIAL KILLERS
IN ROYAL ROBES

19:20.376 --> 19:21.856
AND WE'’RE HELPING THEM.

19:30.691 --> 19:32.910
I HELPED THEM CREATE
A HOST FOR MARCUS.

19:35.435 --> 19:37.306
IT WASN'’T WORTH IT.

19:38.655 --> 19:41.223
YOU ASKED ME THAT
ON THE SHIP.

19:41.267 --> 19:43.312
I THOUGHT IT WAS.
I COULDN'’T SEE PAST

19:43.356 --> 19:45.358
GETTING MARCUS BACK.

19:45.401 --> 19:48.448
I COULDN'’T SEE THAT
YOU WERE RIGHT.

19:48.491 --> 19:50.363
AND THEN I GOT
CLARKE BACK.

19:55.281 --> 19:57.370
I WAS FOCUSING ON
WHAT I LOST

19:57.413 --> 19:58.675
AND NOT WHAT I HAVE.

20:01.330 --> 20:02.766
I DON'’T WANT
TO DO THAT ANYMORE.

20:05.421 --> 20:08.598
I'’M SORRY
FOR ALL OF IT.

20:08.642 --> 20:13.647
FOR THE DRUGS.
FOR DISAPPOINTING YOU.
TRULY.

20:17.825 --> 20:18.956
I'’M SORRY FOR...

20:21.307 --> 20:22.830
HOW THINGS HAVE
BEEN BETWEEN US.

20:27.356 --> 20:29.880
IT WASN'’T ALWAYS FAIR
HOW I JUDGED YOU.

20:31.317 --> 20:32.274
YOU'’RE HUMAN.

20:34.450 --> 20:36.322
AND SOMETIMES,
BEING A HUMAN SUCKS.

20:37.540 --> 20:40.891
I DESERVE TO BE JUDGED
FOR WHAT I DID TO YOU.

20:40.935 --> 20:45.026
AND I WILL NEVER
HURT YOU THAT WAY AGAIN.

20:45.069 --> 20:46.549
I MAY NOT BE
YOUR MOTHER,

20:46.593 --> 20:49.291
BUT YOU ARE
MY FAMILY, RAVEN.

20:59.432 --> 21:01.129
Russell: MAY I PRESENT
OUR FOURTH AND FIFTH

21:01.172 --> 21:02.348
MIRACLES OF THE DAY.

21:02.391 --> 21:04.263
WELCOME BACK
DANIEL PRIME

21:04.306 --> 21:05.916
AND KAYLEE PRIME.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.004
HALLOWED BE
THEIR NAMES.

21:07.048 --> 21:08.441
Guards: HALLOWED BE THEIR NAMES.

21:14.708 --> 21:16.840
I KNOW HOW
AFRAID YOU ARE.

21:18.538 --> 21:20.801
BUT BETRAYING YOUR FRIENDS
IS NOT THE ANSWER.

21:22.542 --> 21:25.240
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THIS
IS GOOD FOR YOU, TOO.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.720
I THINK YOU TWO
SHOULD GET CHANGED

21:26.763 --> 21:27.808
FOR THE CEREMONY.

21:27.851 --> 21:29.462
GUARDS WILL SHOW YOU
TO YOUR SUITES.

21:32.421 --> 21:35.816
ABBY...CAN I GET YOUR
HELP WITH SOMETHING?

21:42.475 --> 21:43.389
WAIT.

21:44.825 --> 21:45.782
SOMETHING WRONG?

21:47.349 --> 21:50.004
YOU'’VE ONLY RESURRECTED
5 PRIMES,

21:50.047 --> 21:51.527
BUT I GAVE YOU
6 DOSES.

21:55.531 --> 21:57.098
WE HAVE ALL
THE HOSTS WE NEED.

21:58.621 --> 22:00.319
I'’M SORRY IT HAS TO
BE THIS WAY, ABBY,

22:00.362 --> 22:02.582
BUT I TOOK
YOUR DAUGHTER.

22:02.625 --> 22:04.192
AS YOU SAID,
YOU WOULD NEVER BE

22:04.235 --> 22:06.499
ABLE TO GET
PAST THAT.

22:06.542 --> 22:08.501
I KNOW I WOULDN'’T.

22:08.544 --> 22:09.589
Raven: NO,
LEAVE HER ALONE!

22:09.632 --> 22:10.459
RAVEN, STOP!

22:10.503 --> 22:11.939
THEY'’LL KILL YOU! DON'T!

22:11.982 --> 22:13.375
DON'’T DO THIS!

22:13.419 --> 22:14.376
UHH!

22:14.420 --> 22:15.551
Abby: JACKSON!
Jackson: UHH!

22:17.510 --> 22:19.381
NO!

23:30.670 --> 23:32.541

70 YEARS
IN THE WILDERNESS,

24:57.670 --> 24:59.889
AND TODAY, YOU JUST
WALTZ RIGHT IN.

25:02.718 --> 25:04.720
I SUPPOSE YOU'’RE HERE
TO KILL ME.

25:06.461 --> 25:08.419
IT'’S NEVER BEEN
ABOUT THAT.

25:08.463 --> 25:11.466
I'’M HERE TO STOP
THE KILLING.

25:11.510 --> 25:15.731
PLEASE. JUST CANCEL
THE NAMINGS.

25:15.775 --> 25:17.733
YOU DON'’T HAVE TO
KEEP DOING THIS.

25:17.777 --> 25:18.908
SURELY BY NOW,
YOU CAN SEE THAT

25:18.952 --> 25:21.955
WITHOUT DEATH,
LIFE IS MEANINGLESS.

25:21.998 --> 25:24.566
SAVE YOUR PHILOSOPHY
LESSONS, DR. SANTIAGO.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.481
YOU'’RE TOO LATE.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.614
THE RESURRECTIONS
ARE DONE.

25:28.657 --> 25:30.354
THE HOSTS WERE HONORED

25:30.398 --> 25:31.921
TO BECOME ONE
WITH THEIR PRIMES.

25:34.184 --> 25:36.796
MOST OF THEM, ANYWAY.

25:36.839 --> 25:39.450
ONLY BECAUSE
WE LIED TO THEM.

25:39.494 --> 25:40.974
THAT'’S OVER NOW.

25:41.017 --> 25:43.454
I SAW THE GRAFFITI
ON MY WAY IN.

25:43.498 --> 25:45.587
IT'’S JUST A MATTER
OF TIME.

25:45.631 --> 25:48.634
THERE IS NOTHING
MORE POWERFUL
THAN THE TRUTH.

25:48.677 --> 25:52.812
YOU'’RE WRONG.
FAITH IS.

25:52.855 --> 25:54.378
WHEN THEIR GODS
RETURN EN MASSE,

25:54.422 --> 25:56.511
THEY'’LL GET
BACK IN LINE,

25:56.555 --> 25:58.992
AND THOSE
WHO DON'’T, WELL,

25:59.035 --> 26:01.603
THERE'’S ALWAYS
THE ADJUSTMENT PROTOCOL.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.257
YOUR ANSWER TO MURDER
IS MORE MURDER.

26:05.085 --> 26:07.957
SAYS THE OLD MAN
IN THE YOUNG BODY.

26:08.001 --> 26:11.352
DR. GABRIEL SANTIAGO
THE WHAT?

26:11.395 --> 26:12.701
THE FIFTH OR SIXTH
OF HIS LINE?

26:12.745 --> 26:14.747
I DIDN'’T WANT THIS.
I WAS READY TO DIE.

26:16.139 --> 26:17.314
SO DIE.

26:19.621 --> 26:23.538
RUSSELL, THIS BODY,
THIS MAN,

26:23.582 --> 26:26.280
HE WAS SOMEONE'’S SON,

26:26.323 --> 26:27.455
SOMEONE'’S BROTHER,

26:27.498 --> 26:28.935
AND HE WAS
KILLED FOR ME.

26:32.852 --> 26:34.462
ALL THE MAN WHO
CONQUERED DEATH WANTS

26:34.505 --> 26:35.768
IS TO DIE.

26:37.552 --> 26:39.423
TONIGHT, YOU'’LL
GET YOUR WISH.

26:40.947 --> 26:43.819
Female voice on P.A.: ATTENTION.
RED SUN TOXIN DETECTED.

26:43.863 --> 26:46.082
MAKE YOUR WAY TO YOUR
ASSIGNED LOCATION.

26:46.126 --> 26:47.867
MY ITINERARY DIDN'’T
MENTION THAT.

26:47.910 --> 26:49.129
Voice on P.A.: ATTENTION...

26:49.172 --> 26:51.653
THE RED SUN ALARM
ON THE DAY YOU RETURN.

26:51.697 --> 26:54.134
Voice on P.A.: ...YOUR ASSIGNED
LOCATION FOR EVACUATION.

26:54.177 --> 26:57.659
AND WITHOUT
AN ECLIPSE, NO LESS.

26:57.703 --> 26:59.879
YOU FORGET I KNOW
HOW TO MANIPULATE

26:59.922 --> 27:02.229
THE RED SUN TOXIN, TOO.

27:09.715 --> 27:12.239
IT'’S TOO SOON.
WE HAVE TO GET
THAT SHIELD DOWN.

27:12.282 --> 27:13.240
WAKE HER UP.

27:13.283 --> 27:14.850
PRIYA. PRIYA.

27:16.373 --> 27:18.724
Clarke: WE NEED
YOUR HELP.

27:22.466 --> 27:23.729
DAMN IT, GABRIEL.

27:25.295 --> 27:27.907
Gabriel: I MAY NOT
BE ABLE TO STOP
THESE RESURRECTIONS,

27:27.950 --> 27:29.778
BUT I CAN MAKE SURE
THEY'’RE THE LAST

27:29.822 --> 27:31.693
BY DESTROYING
THE MIND DRIVES,

27:31.737 --> 27:33.347
STARTING WITH YOURS.

27:35.784 --> 27:38.047
WE'’LL MAKE THIS
VERY SIMPLE.

27:38.091 --> 27:40.702
TAKE DOWN THE REACTOR
AND YOU GET RYKER BACK.

27:40.746 --> 27:41.921
IF YOU DON'’T...

27:48.101 --> 27:49.189
ARE WE CLEAR?

27:52.975 --> 27:54.020
NO, WAIT!

27:58.894 --> 28:00.069
IF YOU WANT
MY DRIVE,

28:00.113 --> 28:02.593
YOU'’RE GOING TO HAVE
TO SHOOT ME.

28:02.637 --> 28:03.943
IN A FEW SECONDS,
THE GUARDS

28:03.986 --> 28:05.771
ARE GOING TO EVACUATE US
TO RYKER'’S KEEP.

28:05.814 --> 28:07.947
YOU HAVE ENOUGH BULLETS
TO KILL THEM, TOO.

28:07.990 --> 28:10.906
THE QUESTION IS,
WILL YOU?

28:12.386 --> 28:14.736
Woman: SIR, WE NEED TO EVACUATE.

28:14.780 --> 28:15.737
DROP IT!

28:15.781 --> 28:16.999
GET OUT RIGHT NOW.

28:17.043 --> 28:18.784
Russell: DON'’T MOVE.

28:18.827 --> 28:20.568
LET HIM KILL ME.

28:20.611 --> 28:22.962
THEN OPEN FIRE
AND GET MY WIFE.

28:23.005 --> 28:24.485
SHE'’LL KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

28:37.498 --> 28:40.153
Russell: YOU NEVER HAD
THE STOMACH TO BE A GOD.

28:43.025 --> 28:44.723
I AM SORRY,
MY FRIEND.

28:48.509 --> 28:49.597
TIE HIM UP.

28:49.640 --> 28:51.077
GATHER THE REST
OF THE PRIMES.

28:51.120 --> 28:53.209
TURN OFF THAT
DAMN ALARM!

28:57.126 --> 29:00.434
MY CHILDREN, CALM YOURSELVES.
CALM.

29:00.477 --> 29:02.610
THERE IS NO ECLIPSE.

29:02.653 --> 29:05.787
THE NAMINGS WILL
GO ON AS PLANNED.

29:05.831 --> 29:08.747
ALL OF YOUR GODS
WILL RETURN TONIGHT.

29:08.790 --> 29:10.792
AND I HAVE MORE GOOD NEWS.

29:10.836 --> 29:13.447
THE DEMON GABRIEL
HAS BEEN CAPTURED.

29:15.057 --> 29:17.843
TONIGHT, WE WILL
VANQUISH HIS EVIL

29:17.886 --> 29:19.845
ONCE AND FOR ALL

29:19.888 --> 29:22.761
AND USHER IN
A NEW ERA OF WONDER

29:22.804 --> 29:26.199
FOR THE GLORY AND GRACE
OF SANCTUM.

29:26.242 --> 29:28.941
Crowd: FOR THE GLORY
AND GRACE OF SANCTUM.

29:47.176 --> 29:50.571
Russell: DANIEL, KAYLEE,
MEET YOUR NEW OLD FRIENDS.

29:50.614 --> 29:54.140
THIS IS CALEB AND JASMINE,
AND THIS IS MIRANDA.

29:57.186 --> 29:58.535
THEY'’RE BROTHER
AND SISTER.

29:58.579 --> 29:59.493
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

30:02.888 --> 30:04.411
TELL ME.

30:04.454 --> 30:05.499
DID YOU EVEN HESITATE

30:05.542 --> 30:06.630
TO BETRAY YOUR FRIENDS?

30:07.806 --> 30:08.763
Russell: IGNORE HIM.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.069
IN A CENTURY OR TWO,

30:10.112 --> 30:12.941
YOU WON'’T EVEN
REMEMBER THESE
PETTY CONCERNS.

30:12.985 --> 30:14.290
Gabriel: AND TO FORGET,

30:14.334 --> 30:16.336
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS GIVE UP YOUR SOUL.

30:29.131 --> 30:30.132
THE SHIELD.

30:34.136 --> 30:35.268
TOLD YOU SHE'’D DO IT.

30:40.534 --> 30:41.883
Nelson: DEATH TO PRIMES!

30:41.927 --> 30:42.884
Children of Gabriel:
DEATH TO PRIMES!

30:44.494 --> 30:46.540
Woman: DEATH TO PRIMES!

30:47.802 --> 30:49.064
Different woman: DEATH!

31:08.562 --> 31:09.650
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

31:16.048 --> 31:17.876
Clarke: I HATE TO CUT
THE MOMENT SHORT,

31:17.919 --> 31:19.007
BUT RUSSELL TOLD
THE PEOPLE THAT IT WAS

31:19.051 --> 31:19.921
A FALSE ALARM.

31:19.965 --> 31:21.140
THEY'’RE NOT EVACUATING.

31:21.183 --> 31:22.750
WE HAVE NO DISTRACTION.

31:22.793 --> 31:24.926
Echo: THE REST OF
OUR FRIENDS ARE
STILL IN TROUBLE,

31:24.970 --> 31:26.014
AND WE DON'’T HAVE
THE PEOPLE

31:26.058 --> 31:27.015
TO FIGHT
OUR WAY THROUGH.

31:27.059 --> 31:28.582
Bellamy: WE'’RE NOT
HERE TO FIGHT.

31:28.625 --> 31:29.626
WE'’RE HERE TO LIBERATE.

31:29.670 --> 31:31.063
Layla: BELLAMY'’S RIGHT,

31:31.106 --> 31:33.108
AND THE ONLY WEAPON WE
NEED FOR THAT IS TRUTH.

31:33.152 --> 31:35.110
YOU SOUND
LIKE GABRIEL.

31:35.154 --> 31:36.938
WHERE IS GABRIEL?

31:36.982 --> 31:39.419
AND WHY DID HE
SET OFF THE ALARM
SO SOON?

31:41.029 --> 31:43.814
THEY WON'’T BELIEVE US
JUST BECAUSE WE
TELL THEM THE TRUTH.

31:43.858 --> 31:45.120
Bellamy: WHAT ARE
YOU THINKING?

31:45.164 --> 31:47.079
I'’M THINKING RYKER
HELPED US START THIS.

31:48.341 --> 31:50.038
HIS MOTHER
WILL FINISH IT.

31:59.047 --> 32:00.570
Clarke: THEY THINK
I'’M JOSEPHINE,

32:00.614 --> 32:02.137
SO IT CAN'’T BE ME.

32:23.637 --> 32:25.508
Woman: WE'’VE GOT MOVEMENT
UP THE FAR STAIRS.

32:32.428 --> 32:34.430
Woman: PRIYA PRIME!
DON'’T SHOOT!

32:37.259 --> 32:39.392
Bellamy: THE POWER IS OUT,
THE SHIELD IS DOWN,

32:39.435 --> 32:42.047
BUT WE ARE NOT
HERE TO FIGHT.

32:42.090 --> 32:43.309
I HAVE SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU

32:43.352 --> 32:45.180
THAT WILL BE
HARD TO HEAR,

32:45.224 --> 32:46.486
BUT IT'’S THE TRUTH.

32:48.140 --> 32:51.839
THE PRIMES TOLD YOU
THAT WE'’RE YOUR ENEMY.

32:51.882 --> 32:53.232
THEY LIED.

32:53.275 --> 32:56.017
THEY LIED
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

32:56.061 --> 32:57.410
THEY'’RE NOT GODS.

32:57.453 --> 33:00.065
THEY DON'’T BECOME ONE
WITH THEIR HOSTS.

33:01.109 --> 33:02.589
THEY KILL THEM.

33:04.199 --> 33:05.331
THEY STEAL
YOUR BODIES

33:05.374 --> 33:07.115
SO THEY CAN
LIVE FOREVER.

33:10.205 --> 33:11.598
TELL THEM.

33:21.216 --> 33:22.522
IT'’S TRUE.

33:25.568 --> 33:27.092
WE'’RE NOT DIVINE.

33:28.571 --> 33:29.616
Russell: OPEN IT.

33:30.878 --> 33:33.359
Priya: WE SURVIVE BECAUSE
WE HAVE TECHNOLOGY.

33:35.143 --> 33:37.102
BUT WE NEED YOUR BODIES
TO DO IT.

33:39.930 --> 33:42.498
DELILAH'’S NOT ONE WITH ME.

33:42.542 --> 33:44.239
SHE'’S DEAD,

33:44.283 --> 33:46.807
KILLED SO THAT I COULD RETURN.

33:48.635 --> 33:50.071
IT'’S ALL A LIE.

33:57.557 --> 33:58.775
Man: ALL LIES.

33:58.819 --> 34:00.168
Woman: LIARS!

34:04.129 --> 34:06.566
Russell: I AM DISAPPOINTED
IN YOU, PRIYA.

34:08.959 --> 34:11.571
I'’M DISAPPOINTED IN ALL OF YOU.

34:13.660 --> 34:16.489
ACCORDING TO OUR
ADJUSTMENT PROTOCOL...

34:18.491 --> 34:21.581
NONBELIEVERS MUST BE PURIFIED!

34:27.239 --> 34:29.937
AAH! I FEEL IT!

34:29.980 --> 34:32.244
EEE! WE'’RE ALL GONNA DIE!

34:32.287 --> 34:34.811
Layla: EVERYBODY,
ANTITOXIN, NOW.

34:36.161 --> 34:39.033
Bellamy: BREATHE DEEPLY.
YOU'’RE GOOD FOR TWO HOURS.

34:40.339 --> 34:42.515
UNLOCK THE
PROCESSING ROOM
FOR THE ADJUSTERS.

34:44.125 --> 34:45.822
TELL THEM
TO USE IT ALL.

34:45.866 --> 34:48.303
MOVE THE PRISONERS
FROM THE LAB TO THE GREAT HALL.

34:49.609 --> 34:51.001
Man: DISBELIEVERS!

34:52.481 --> 34:54.222
Layla: WHERE
THE HELL IS PRIYA?

34:54.266 --> 34:55.310
Bellamy: THE TOXIN
SEPARATED US.

34:55.354 --> 34:56.616
THE CROWD
GOT BETWEEN US.

34:58.357 --> 35:00.837
Woman: DIE,
NONBELIEVER! UHH!

35:06.191 --> 35:08.932
Priya: HELP THEM, PLEASE,
FOR DELILAH.

35:10.717 --> 35:11.805
MURDERER!

35:24.426 --> 35:26.298
Man: ALL OF YOU, GET BACK!

35:26.341 --> 35:27.516
I WILL KILL YOU ALL!

35:29.910 --> 35:30.867
NO.

35:32.391 --> 35:33.957
Miller: JAX?

35:34.001 --> 35:35.742
JAX!

35:35.785 --> 35:36.873
Octavia: YOU CAN'’T.

35:36.917 --> 35:39.224
I DO NOT TAKE
ORDERS FROM
YOU ANYMORE!

35:39.267 --> 35:40.486
Bellamy: MILLER,
SHE'’S RIGHT.

35:40.529 --> 35:42.749
YOU'’LL NEVER MAKE IT
PAST THE GUARDS.

35:42.792 --> 35:45.143
NO, BUT I CAN.

35:45.186 --> 35:46.796
I'’M GOING WITH YOU.

35:46.840 --> 35:49.495
Clarke: GAIA.
Gaia: THEY'’LL THINK
I'’M JOSEPHINE'S GUARD.

35:49.538 --> 35:51.366
IT'’S MADI.
I'’M GOING.

35:51.410 --> 35:52.802
OK.

35:52.846 --> 35:54.152
MILLER, STAY HERE

35:54.195 --> 35:55.370
AND PROTECT
THE OTHERS.

35:55.414 --> 35:58.156
I'’LL GET HIM BACK.
TRUST ME.

35:58.199 --> 36:00.245
Man: BLASPHEMERS.

36:00.288 --> 36:01.985
Octavia: UH, GUYS?

36:02.029 --> 36:03.161
WE'’VE GOT A PROBLEM.

36:03.204 --> 36:05.641
Man: KILL THE INVADERS! AAH!

36:06.729 --> 36:08.209
Bellamy: GO.
Clarke: WHAT WILL YOU DO?

36:08.253 --> 36:11.430
LOOK, I'’M STILL WORKING
ON THAT PART. JUST GO!

36:11.473 --> 36:13.432
MILLER, WEAPONS DOWN.
WE DON'’T WANT
TO KILL THEM, OK?

36:13.475 --> 36:15.173
THEY WANT
TO KILL US.

36:15.216 --> 36:17.044
Bellamy: MOVE IN!

36:17.087 --> 36:19.394
IF WE START FIGHTING,
IT WILL TURN INTO A BLOODBATH.

36:19.438 --> 36:21.396
WE NEED TO TAKE COVER
AND WAIT IT OUT.

36:21.440 --> 36:22.832
FOLLOW ME!

37:08.574 --> 37:10.010
THANK GOD.

37:10.053 --> 37:11.446
WHERE HAVE
YOU BEEN?

37:11.490 --> 37:12.752
I WAS LOOKING
FOR PRIYA.

37:12.795 --> 37:14.406
BUT THEN I WAS
BLOCKED BY A BUNCH OF

37:14.449 --> 37:16.451
GABRIEL'’S LUNATIC
CHILDREN.

37:16.495 --> 37:18.279
SHE'’S DEAD,
BY THE WAY.

37:18.323 --> 37:20.281
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

37:20.325 --> 37:22.892
Abby-Simone: WE'’RE LEAVING
SANCTUM UNTIL IT'’S PURIFIED.

37:43.696 --> 37:44.653
MOM.

37:47.352 --> 37:50.311
Gabriel: YOUR MOTHER
MURDERED HER MOTHER.

37:50.355 --> 37:51.791
IRONIC, DON'’T YOU THINK?

37:53.532 --> 37:56.448
DON'’T YOU SPEAK
TO ME. UHH!

37:57.884 --> 38:00.365
HOW COULD I HAVE EVER
LOVED SUCH A TRAITOR?

38:08.982 --> 38:10.418
OH, SWEETHEART.

38:12.115 --> 38:13.421
AT LEAST
YOU HAVE CLOSURE.

38:15.336 --> 38:16.468
Russell: THAT'’S ENOUGH.

38:16.511 --> 38:17.469
NOW THAT WE'’RE
ALL ACCOUNTED FOR,

38:17.512 --> 38:18.557
IT'’S TIME TO GO.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.385
HAVE YOU ALL TAKEN
THE ANTITOXIN?

38:20.428 --> 38:22.343
GO? WHERE?

38:22.387 --> 38:23.953
TO SPACE,
OF COURSE.

38:23.997 --> 38:25.955
SANCTUM HAS
LOST US.

38:25.999 --> 38:27.348
FOR NOW, ANYWAY.

38:27.392 --> 38:31.396
WE HAVE NO PILOT.
PRIYA'’S DEAD.

38:31.439 --> 38:33.485
MAYBE IF YOU DIDN'’T
KILL THE LEES.

38:35.530 --> 38:38.228
Abby-Simone: THAT WON'’T
BE A PROBLEM.

38:38.272 --> 38:39.969
WE DON'’T NEED THE LEES,

38:40.013 --> 38:41.362
DO WE, RAVEN?

38:41.406 --> 38:43.146
GO FLOAT YOURSELF,
MURDERER.

38:54.636 --> 38:55.550
HOW ABOUT NOW?

38:58.423 --> 38:59.641
YOU HAVE 3 SECONDS.

39:01.730 --> 39:03.863
1...2...

39:03.906 --> 39:05.255
OK.

39:05.299 --> 39:06.561
GOOD CHOICE.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.608
Russell: EXCELLENT.

39:09.651 --> 39:11.131
GUARDS, TAKE THE PRISONERS.

39:11.174 --> 39:12.393
Guard: YES, SIR.
Russell: WE'’RE USING THE TUNNEL,

39:12.437 --> 39:14.395
BUT BE PREPARED FOR ANYTHING.

39:22.490 --> 39:26.538
GOOD-BYE, OLD FRIEND.
SANCTUM IS YOURS,

39:26.581 --> 39:28.627
THOUGH I SUSPECT YOU
WON'’T LAST VERY LONG.

39:37.592 --> 39:38.767
YOU'’RE
NOT COMING?

39:41.509 --> 39:42.684
YOU KILLED HER.

39:42.728 --> 39:44.947
ALL SHE DID WAS HELP
AND YOU KILLED HER.

39:48.690 --> 39:49.865
WE'’RE STAYING.

39:52.390 --> 39:53.565
WE'’RE GONNA SAVE
OUR PEOPLE.

39:57.612 --> 39:59.527
I'’M PROUD
OF YOU, MURPHY.

40:06.055 --> 40:07.622
JUST SO YOU KNOW,

40:07.666 --> 40:09.102
JOSEPHINE CALLED ME
"JOHN."

40:15.108 --> 40:18.024
Russell: JOSIE, DANIEL, KAYLEE,
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

40:19.547 --> 40:22.463
THEY CHANGED
THEIR MINDS.
COWARDS.

40:24.683 --> 40:26.815
THE MIND DRIVE IS
A TERRIBLE THING
TO WASTE.

40:28.687 --> 40:30.515
JOSIE, BRING YOUR
GUARDS AND LET'’S GO.

40:32.560 --> 40:34.519
GUARDS, MOVE OUT.

40:37.522 --> 40:39.437
WAIT.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.482
SHE'’S ONE OF THEM.

40:41.526 --> 40:43.484
THROW HER
TO THE WOLVES.

40:43.528 --> 40:44.572
NO.

40:47.880 --> 40:50.491
I SAW HER IN
CLARKE'’S MIND.

40:50.535 --> 40:52.537
THREATENING THE CHILD
MAY WORK ON RAVEN,

40:52.580 --> 40:54.452
BUT IF I'’M RIGHT,
WE NEED HER

40:54.495 --> 40:55.540
TO GET ON THAT SHIP.

41:14.080 --> 41:15.821
Computer voice:
TRANSPORT SHIP IS SECURE.

41:15.864 --> 41:18.563
AIRLOCK ENGAGED.
AIRLOCK SECURE.
