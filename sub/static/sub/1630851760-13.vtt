WEBVTT

00:55.847 --> 00:57.182
It's almost done.

00:57.766 --> 00:59.350
EPISODE 13

01:01.603 --> 01:03.188
Oh, my goodness.

01:04.397 --> 01:08.777
This is all seaweed? It's way too much.

01:08.860 --> 01:12.030
Hey, why does seaweed expand so much?

01:12.572 --> 01:16.076
I had no idea
one small package would become this much.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.994
If you crave seaweed soup,

01:18.078 --> 01:20.163
you should just buy cooked one.

01:20.246 --> 01:23.166
A terrible cook like you
shouldn't attempt anything.

01:23.249 --> 01:24.542
I agree.

01:24.626 --> 01:28.171
But it's Chief Hong's birthday today.

01:28.755 --> 01:31.466
Since it's our first time
celebrating it together,

01:31.549 --> 01:33.551
I should cook for him.

01:35.220 --> 01:37.180
-Do you want to try some?
-No.

01:37.847 --> 01:39.182
It must be really delicious.

01:39.849 --> 01:40.683
No, thanks.

01:41.768 --> 01:43.061
-I bet it's good.
-No.

01:43.144 --> 01:44.813
-I followed the recipe.
-No, thanks.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.147
Come on.

01:46.231 --> 01:48.316
I'm sure you'll love it. Try some.

01:48.399 --> 01:50.193
-No, thanks.
-It's tasty.

01:50.276 --> 01:52.654
I don't want it. No!

01:56.324 --> 01:57.617
Chief Hong.

02:00.829 --> 02:01.704
Chief Hong.

02:01.788 --> 02:02.705
Goodness.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.207
Hey, you're here.

02:04.290 --> 02:05.708
-Come in.
-Hello, Dr. Yoon.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.085
-Hey.
-Hey.

02:07.168 --> 02:08.962
-Dr. Yoon.
-Come in.

02:09.045 --> 02:12.507
-That spot is the coolest.
-Sit down.

02:12.590 --> 02:13.758
I'm working on it.

02:13.842 --> 02:15.135
Sit there.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.219
Okay.

02:22.767 --> 02:24.894
What's going on? They're all here?

02:24.978 --> 02:26.729
This is a yearly thing.

02:27.397 --> 02:29.899
I tell them not to,
but they still do this every year.

02:29.983 --> 02:30.900
Gosh.

02:30.984 --> 02:34.028
Suk-ja, bring lots of <i>japchae</i>.

02:34.112 --> 02:36.447
Okay. I should bring more.

02:36.531 --> 02:37.407
This is good.

02:37.490 --> 02:40.285
I'm going to serve the seaweed soup now.

02:40.785 --> 02:42.579
-How many bowls?
-Hold on.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.747
Two, four, six… Thirteen bowls.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.958
Nam-suk, you forgot to count yourself.

02:48.084 --> 02:49.502
Fourteen including me.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.045
Where's Yeong-guk, by the way?

02:51.129 --> 02:52.589
Who knows? He hung up on me.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.299
Gosh, he's cold.

02:54.382 --> 02:57.051
<i>-Happy birthday</i>
-You have horrible pronunciation.

02:57.135 --> 02:59.637
-I pretty much sound like a native.
-That's absurd.

02:59.721 --> 03:02.140
What? You guys are here already?

03:02.223 --> 03:03.474
Seriously?

03:03.558 --> 03:07.186
<i>-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you</i>

03:07.270 --> 03:10.648
<i>-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you</i>

03:10.732 --> 03:14.193
<i>-Happy birthday, dear Chief Hong
-Happy birthday, dear Chief Hong</i>

03:14.277 --> 03:18.698
<i>-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you</i>

03:21.701 --> 03:24.829
I told you this wasn't necessary.
You're embarrassing me.

03:24.913 --> 03:27.707
This only happens once a year.
We must celebrate it.

03:27.790 --> 03:29.584
-Right.
-Hey, blow them out.

03:29.667 --> 03:31.336
-Okay.
-Blow out the candles.

03:34.547 --> 03:35.798
Thank you, guys.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.759
You should also cut the cake.

03:37.842 --> 03:39.218
-Right. Here's the knife.
-Hey.

03:39.302 --> 03:41.512
-Do it with her.
-Me?

03:41.596 --> 03:44.140
-Come here.
-Hurry up, Dr. Yoon.

03:45.266 --> 03:49.979
-All right.
-Gam-ri, they look great together.

03:50.063 --> 03:53.316
-Right?
-I agree. Seeing them side by side

03:53.399 --> 03:56.277
makes this seem like
an engagement ceremony.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.404
Gosh, don't exaggerate like that.

03:58.488 --> 04:01.366
We also did that for our wedding.

04:01.449 --> 04:03.493
Do you remember our three-tier cake?

04:04.661 --> 04:06.746
What? This is good.

04:06.829 --> 04:08.248
He's so useless.

04:08.331 --> 04:09.457
You idiot.

04:09.540 --> 04:11.417
Go ahead and cut the cake.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.837
-Go on.
-Congratulations.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.089
Thanks.

04:16.589 --> 04:17.799
Thanks, everyone.

04:20.510 --> 04:21.344
Thank you.

04:26.432 --> 04:27.684
What's that in your hand?

04:28.268 --> 04:31.145
Oh, this? I made this seaweed soup myself.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.231
But you already had some.

04:33.314 --> 04:34.816
You made it yourself?

04:34.899 --> 04:35.858
Yes.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.902
Let me see it. Let's see.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.239
-What for?
-I can have another bowl.

04:41.322 --> 04:42.865
Seaweed is good for you.

04:43.783 --> 04:46.035
-Let me have a taste.
-No, you don't have to.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.245
No, I want to.

04:48.454 --> 04:49.289
All right.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.419
Gosh, it looks delicious.

04:59.465 --> 05:01.801
How is it? Is it good?

05:01.884 --> 05:02.760
I like it.

05:07.223 --> 05:08.099
It's tasty.

05:10.685 --> 05:11.686
It's so salty.

05:12.687 --> 05:13.813
So salty.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.607
It even smells salty.

05:16.691 --> 05:19.736
No one deserves to eat that.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.364
Are you serious?

05:23.448 --> 05:24.449
Yes, it's tasty.

05:25.074 --> 05:28.619
See? I can cook if I want to.

05:29.412 --> 05:30.496
Let me try it too.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.290
No, this is all mine.

05:32.874 --> 05:35.960
-Share some with me--
-No, I'll have it all.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.795
Is it really that good?

05:37.879 --> 05:39.756
This is mine. You made it for me.

05:39.839 --> 05:42.300
-Let me have a sip.
-No, it's mine.

05:42.383 --> 05:44.677
I made it, so I should have a sip too.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.387
-It's for me, though.
-I made it.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.306
-You can't take it back.
-Give it to me.

05:48.389 --> 05:49.807
-Why?
-I want a sip.

05:49.891 --> 05:53.102
No, you can't.
It's my birthday gift, so it's all mine.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.063
But I made it.

05:55.146 --> 05:57.273
-So? It's too tasty to share.
-How greedy!

05:57.356 --> 05:58.524
All right.

05:58.608 --> 06:02.987
Gosh. How about
some watermelon for dessert?

06:03.071 --> 06:04.280
Sounds great.

06:04.363 --> 06:07.533
All right. How should I cut this?

06:07.617 --> 06:09.452
-It looks so tasty.
-Wait a minute.

06:09.535 --> 06:12.830
I forgot I had something urgent.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.999
I'm afraid I should head back now.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.667
-But the watermelon--
-I see.

06:16.751 --> 06:18.086
What, Ju-ri?

06:18.169 --> 06:19.879
-You left that thing?
-No.

06:19.962 --> 06:21.506
-The--
-You know, that thing.

06:21.589 --> 06:22.757
-What?
-The DOS goods.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.300
-What? No--
-Why would you

06:24.383 --> 06:26.469
-say that now?
-I'll buy you one.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.346
I should head back home too.

06:28.429 --> 06:31.599
-You too?
-I'm too sleepy to be here.

06:31.682 --> 06:35.520
-Goodness gracious, my butt.
-Oh, dear.

06:35.603 --> 06:38.022
My butt hurts too much.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.649
-Gosh, my legs.
-Bye, Chief Hong.

06:39.732 --> 06:40.942
Bye, Ms. Suk-ja.

06:41.025 --> 06:42.151
I should head back too.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.529
-You too?
-I should check I-jun's homework.

06:44.612 --> 06:47.115
-Goodbye, then.
-We should go too.

06:47.198 --> 06:49.367
-Goodbye.
-Bo-ra, wake up. Let's go.

06:49.450 --> 06:51.536
-Get up, now.
-Why is everyone leaving?

06:51.619 --> 06:53.329
We haven't even started drinking yet.

06:53.412 --> 06:56.415
We should have a taste of that.
I bet it's expensive.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.084
Take the hint, will you?

06:58.167 --> 07:00.002
Right. I see.

07:01.754 --> 07:02.630
Let's go, Bo-ra.

07:02.713 --> 07:04.215
She's so sleepy.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.342
-Bye.
-Bye.

07:06.425 --> 07:08.136
-Goodbye.
-Hurry up.

07:08.219 --> 07:10.179
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.931
-Goodbye!
-Bye!

07:12.014 --> 07:12.849
Bye!

07:13.724 --> 07:16.227
They're giving us privacy, aren't they?

07:17.562 --> 07:19.647
They're terrible actors.

07:19.730 --> 07:21.941
They all can't act to save their lives.

07:22.024 --> 07:23.651
Tell me about it. Horrible.

07:23.734 --> 07:24.694
Horrible?

07:29.031 --> 07:30.491
-Geum-cheol.
-Yes?

07:30.575 --> 07:32.577
Can you walk a bit slowly?

07:33.161 --> 07:34.996
We should hurry home and rest.

07:35.079 --> 07:38.958
This baby is weighing me down.

07:39.041 --> 07:41.669
Can't you see that I'm carrying Bo-ra?
I'm exhausted too.

07:43.129 --> 07:44.213
-Geum-cheol.
-Yes?

07:44.297 --> 07:47.717
How about we ask Ms. Yeo
to take care of Bo-ra this weekend

07:47.800 --> 07:48.968
and go on a date?

07:49.051 --> 07:50.344
-A date?
-Yes.

07:50.428 --> 07:53.556
Things will get
even more hectic once the baby is born.

07:54.223 --> 07:56.309
We won't have much alone time.

07:56.392 --> 07:59.479
How can we go anywhere
when you can barely walk?

07:59.562 --> 08:02.523
Just rest at home
since our baby is due soon.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.025
-Okay?
-Okay.

08:04.108 --> 08:04.984
Good.

08:14.869 --> 08:17.455
We finally have our alone time.

08:18.623 --> 08:21.000
Chief Hong, happy birthday.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.714
Thanks.

08:29.091 --> 08:31.469
Should we drink this?

08:31.552 --> 08:32.929
-I'll get the glasses.
-Okay.

08:35.139 --> 08:36.849
I can't wait.

08:41.604 --> 08:44.607
What is this? It looks new.

08:45.107 --> 08:46.943
I made that for you.

08:47.652 --> 08:48.486
For me?

08:50.238 --> 08:53.157
But it is your birthday, not mine.

08:53.241 --> 08:56.118
Don't get ahead of yourself.
You need to wait a year.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.745
That long?

08:57.828 --> 09:00.373
The alcohol will become sweeter with time.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.084
Let's see.

09:05.253 --> 09:07.588
-What are you doing?
-I want to…

09:09.966 --> 09:12.593
make it clear that it's mine.

09:12.677 --> 09:13.678
YOON HYE-JIN

09:13.761 --> 09:15.888
You definitely have a strong ego.

09:16.472 --> 09:17.557
I won't deny it.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.726
Will we be able to drink that

09:21.519 --> 09:23.437
-on your next birthday?
-Yes.

09:29.193 --> 09:32.321
Summer, fall, winter…

09:32.405 --> 09:34.699
Then it'll be spring and summer again.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.160
What will have happened

09:39.495 --> 09:40.663
a year from now?

09:42.248 --> 09:43.332
Of course…

09:47.295 --> 09:48.588
It'll have become sweet.

09:50.047 --> 09:51.048
I'll open this.

09:52.091 --> 09:53.551
Yes, I'm sure it will.

09:56.178 --> 09:57.179
Right.

10:03.686 --> 10:06.230
-Hello.
-Hello.

10:06.314 --> 10:09.233
Hello. But what brings you here?

10:09.900 --> 10:13.654
Since it's so hot today,
I thought I'd visit and check on them.

10:13.738 --> 10:14.947
What are you guys doing?

10:15.531 --> 10:17.658
Can't you see? We're cleaning.

10:17.742 --> 10:20.953
Unlike you who needs a reason
to come here, we visit often.

10:21.537 --> 10:23.873
Don't make me out to be that guy.

10:23.956 --> 10:27.209
Gosh, these recyclables
haven't been separated.

10:29.837 --> 10:30.671
What?

10:31.505 --> 10:33.174
The watermelon isn't ripe.

10:33.257 --> 10:35.051
The stem is too green.

10:35.134 --> 10:38.054
You should've bought
a round one with clearer stripes.

10:38.554 --> 10:42.016
Mr. Ban, is that coffee?

10:42.099 --> 10:46.395
Yes, ma'am.
Mr. Chang brought them for you ladies.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.813
Is that it?

10:47.897 --> 10:49.023
But I prefer

10:49.106 --> 10:52.860
the condensed milk latte
that Director Ji bought us before.

10:53.611 --> 10:56.155
-We don't have that.
-I prefer

10:56.238 --> 10:59.659
the Belgian chocolate mocha.
That was tasty.

10:59.742 --> 11:02.620
No, the "shake-it-rato" tasted better.

11:02.703 --> 11:04.789
Is that what it's called?

11:06.123 --> 11:08.584
No. It's shakerato.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.836
Sha… what's that?

11:10.920 --> 11:13.506
You should've gotten those instead.

11:13.589 --> 11:14.924
We should have.

11:15.007 --> 11:18.344
Mr. Chang, don't just stand there.
Go recycle these.

11:18.427 --> 11:20.179
-Me?
-Then who?

11:20.262 --> 11:23.349
Are you here just to watch us?
Set a good example.

11:23.432 --> 11:26.977
What? Don't be ridiculous.
Let me take care of this.

11:27.061 --> 11:30.689
-I'll take care of this.
-Sure.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.483
-Gosh. Come here.
-That looks good.

11:32.566 --> 11:34.735
-Let's eat first.
-Gosh.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.487
Hwa-jeong.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.365
What now?

11:41.909 --> 11:44.578
So you said you'd discard

11:44.662 --> 11:47.581
your family name if you cheated.

11:49.625 --> 11:52.294
I have no idea
what you're talking about. What is this?

11:52.378 --> 11:55.089
"What is this?" Look at you.

11:55.172 --> 11:59.135
Hey, you'll never be able to fool me.

12:00.511 --> 12:01.720
Hey, you…

12:03.055 --> 12:04.723
-I'll go first.
-Look at you.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.892
I have to serve a group of 45 customers.

12:06.976 --> 12:11.856
It's so obvious
that you're trying to change the subject.

12:11.939 --> 12:14.275
Hold on. Where are they from?

12:14.358 --> 12:16.527
Chung-ho Industry? Chung-ho Cement?

12:16.610 --> 12:17.611
Just go.

12:17.695 --> 12:20.656
But they said
they were coming to my restaurant. Hey!

12:21.157 --> 12:23.701
-Enjoy your meal.
-You too.

12:28.372 --> 12:29.999
What? Is he not eating?

12:30.499 --> 12:31.333
No.

12:33.210 --> 12:34.712
This is unlike him.

12:35.296 --> 12:38.716
He treated himself to a grand meal
after being told off by the committee.

12:38.799 --> 12:42.011
That's him. But nowadays,
he's refusing to eat anything

12:42.094 --> 12:44.597
Not exactly.
I made him drink milk yesterday.

12:44.680 --> 12:47.349
Whatever. This is all your fault,

12:47.433 --> 12:49.393
-so fix it yourself.
-What did I do?

12:49.477 --> 12:50.936
You know why he's doing this.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.855
He doesn't want you to quit.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.899
How much is TCB going to pay you?

12:54.982 --> 12:58.152
Just negotiate with our company
and ask for a raise.

12:58.861 --> 13:01.780
Do-ha, don't be so ridiculous.

13:03.324 --> 13:05.117
I was just worried about you starving.

13:05.701 --> 13:07.286
And I wanted her to stay.

13:07.369 --> 13:08.329
What do you mean?

13:08.913 --> 13:10.998
You're starving, and Ms. Wang is quitting?

13:11.081 --> 13:13.876
Gosh, that was fast.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.712
I'm going to have pork belly
by myself today.

13:17.463 --> 13:18.797
By yourself?

13:18.881 --> 13:21.800
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that to her.

13:21.884 --> 13:24.887
It's okay. I'm sorry for what I said.

13:28.390 --> 13:30.768
This won't do. Guys, come with me.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.897
-Where are you taking us? Where?
-Over there.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.901
Gosh, your house is superb.

13:40.110 --> 13:41.987
The ceiling is awesome.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.448
The lights are so cool.

13:45.449 --> 13:47.034
And so is the furniture.

13:49.411 --> 13:52.790
Do-ha tends to be
all over the place. I'm sorry about that.

13:53.457 --> 13:55.960
You have a lot of medicinal herbs too.

13:57.294 --> 13:59.171
Aren't these <i>seomoktae</i>?

13:59.255 --> 14:02.216
Yes, it's a kind of small bean.
How did you know?

14:02.299 --> 14:05.386
Well, my father is a bit ill.

14:05.469 --> 14:07.137
He's paraplegic.

14:07.221 --> 14:11.559
I heard those beans increase blood flow
and help with paralysis, so I got some.

14:11.642 --> 14:14.812
Gosh, you're such a caring son.

14:14.895 --> 14:17.189
He's kinder than he looks.

14:17.273 --> 14:20.609
What are you talking about?
My face screams I'm a kind person.

14:20.693 --> 14:21.986
You don't…

14:22.486 --> 14:25.281
Rather, you look like the sly type.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.157
Hey, I second that.

14:27.658 --> 14:29.785
You guys are unbelievable.

14:30.369 --> 14:33.247
I'm almost done here,
so let's get ready to eat.

14:33.330 --> 14:37.418
All right. Here it is. Gosh, it's heavy.

14:40.963 --> 14:42.339
Eat up, Do-ha.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.300
-Okay.
-Here you go.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.011
You too, Director Ji.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.179
Thanks.

14:49.763 --> 14:52.433
By the way, what's the occasion?

14:52.516 --> 14:57.146
Well… I just feel bad for some things.

14:58.314 --> 15:02.693
What is it? Is it because Dr. Yoon
chose you over him?

15:03.319 --> 15:05.404
Hey, how did you know?

15:05.487 --> 15:07.364
You got your lucky llama back.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.575
At least the show won't flop.

15:11.327 --> 15:12.536
Thank you for the meal.

15:13.370 --> 15:14.997
It's not because of that.

15:15.080 --> 15:18.459
This is for stealing both drumsticks
the other day.

15:19.793 --> 15:20.628
Thanks.

15:21.962 --> 15:24.506
-How is it?
-This is insanely good.

15:25.174 --> 15:26.508
-Insane, right?
-Totally.

15:28.135 --> 15:29.762
Eat up, will you?

15:36.977 --> 15:37.895
It's so tasty.

15:37.978 --> 15:40.898
I make 1 of the top 3
<i>samgyetang</i> dishes here in Gongjin.

15:41.857 --> 15:42.983
You'll crave it again.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.579
Do-ha is doing the dishes.

15:56.622 --> 16:00.167
What is it? Are you on a power trip
since you're his boss?

16:00.751 --> 16:03.212
Maybe I am, subconsciously.

16:03.295 --> 16:06.006
Whatever. He volunteered,
saying he ate the most.

16:07.257 --> 16:08.842
You didn't eat much.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.052
I'm sorry.

16:10.970 --> 16:14.056
I should've shown my appreciation
and not nibbled on the food.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.933
Is this because of Ms. Wang quitting?

16:20.521 --> 16:22.648
Well… I guess.

16:23.857 --> 16:25.943
That's when I started losing my appetite.

16:26.026 --> 16:28.195
Did she tell you the reason?

16:28.278 --> 16:31.156
She says she wants to change things up

16:31.907 --> 16:33.701
and work in a new environment.

16:33.784 --> 16:35.619
Do you think that's her only reason?

16:36.829 --> 16:38.789
-Then?
-A while back,

16:38.872 --> 16:42.710
she told me that she admired you.

16:43.585 --> 16:45.879
Do you think
she only admired you as a colleague?

16:48.465 --> 16:50.634
This slowness of yours
is why you lost Hye-jin.

16:50.718 --> 16:53.846
Hey. You rub salt into my wound now?

16:53.929 --> 16:56.974
I think you have
a bigger wound to worry about.

16:57.057 --> 16:58.142
What do you mean?

16:58.225 --> 17:01.937
You look more hurt now
than you did back then.

17:02.604 --> 17:04.732
You even lost your appetite this time.

17:10.696 --> 17:12.656
Look at this from a different angle.

17:12.740 --> 17:16.869
Who knows? Perhaps, life has
something else in store for you.

17:22.124 --> 17:23.417
I'm done with the dishes!

17:24.752 --> 17:27.171
He's done already. How is he so quick?

17:27.254 --> 17:28.505
Did he do it properly?

17:33.719 --> 17:36.388
Gosh, it must be so tiring
to drive back to Seoul.

17:37.639 --> 17:40.017
Thanks for the meal.

17:41.018 --> 17:43.645
My body really needed that. Thank you.

17:44.813 --> 17:46.440
Right. Take this.

17:47.775 --> 17:48.609
What's this?

17:48.692 --> 17:52.446
It's aralia cordata.
It's good for sore muscles and paralysis.

17:52.529 --> 17:54.281
Soak it and make tea with it.

17:54.364 --> 17:55.741
It's for your father.

17:56.241 --> 17:59.787
Thank you.
I really didn't expect such a gift.

18:01.121 --> 18:04.625
Thank you. As his boss,
I should've treated him to a good meal.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.668
You're better than me.

18:06.752 --> 18:09.379
Oh, please.
Don't get all emotional over nothing.

18:09.463 --> 18:11.799
Go on. I need to go to work too. Bye.

18:12.382 --> 18:13.550
-Bye.
-Bye.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.469
-Thank you.
-Sure.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.972
I always knew he was an incredible guy,

18:19.056 --> 18:20.432
but this is really touching.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.559
I hate to admit it, but he really is.

18:22.643 --> 18:23.852
But you're incredible too.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.939
You're kind toward your former love rival.

18:27.022 --> 18:28.357
You're pretty much a saint.

18:28.440 --> 18:32.319
Yes, and you just enraged a saint.

18:32.402 --> 18:33.862
-Come here.
-Gosh.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.489
-Come here, you.
-What did I do?

18:35.572 --> 18:37.407
YOON DENTAL CLINIC

18:37.991 --> 18:39.159
Hye-jin!

18:40.536 --> 18:43.664
Gosh, what brings you guys here?
You didn't even call.

18:43.747 --> 18:46.041
We're attending a seminar nearby.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.044
We came early to play golf
and thought we'd say hi.

18:49.128 --> 18:52.005
I saved your address
when I sent the congratulatory flowers.

18:52.089 --> 18:55.050
-I see.
-I thought it'd be teeming with patients,

18:55.134 --> 18:56.802
but it's pretty empty.

18:56.885 --> 18:59.388
You see…

19:00.013 --> 19:01.932
They need to book an appointment first.

19:02.641 --> 19:06.270
I see. This is exactly
how I pictured your clinic.

19:06.353 --> 19:08.480
A seaside clinic in the countryside.

19:08.564 --> 19:09.857
How cute.

19:10.649 --> 19:11.483
Thanks.

19:12.609 --> 19:14.987
Wait. It reminds me of a dollhouse.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.699
The lobby is small, and so is the office.

19:18.782 --> 19:20.534
Everything's so small.

19:21.368 --> 19:24.163
How about we go out

19:24.246 --> 19:26.540
and have some coffee? It's my treat.

19:26.623 --> 19:31.420
Sure. We didn't even walk around,
but we're already done with the tour.

19:32.588 --> 19:33.839
Wait outside.

19:33.922 --> 19:35.174
Let me just get changed.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.758
-Sure.
-Okay.

19:38.385 --> 19:40.679
-Why are they here?
-Who are they?

19:40.762 --> 19:43.307
-What's with them?
-Did I wear expensive clothes today?

19:43.390 --> 19:44.349
I don't remember.

19:45.392 --> 19:46.643
This is so annoying.

19:47.186 --> 19:51.899
<i>Exercising in the moonlight
Because I can't sleep</i>

19:51.982 --> 19:56.862
Two glasses of iced Americano
and one glass of iced vanilla latte.

19:56.945 --> 19:59.823
-Thank you for the coffee.
-Are they your friends?

19:59.907 --> 20:02.534
-Thank you.
-You're both pretty.

20:03.285 --> 20:06.163
Are all the countryside cafes like this?

20:06.246 --> 20:09.499
The decorations and vibe are so tacky.

20:09.583 --> 20:12.920
You're right.
It's neither a cafe nor a bar.

20:13.003 --> 20:15.130
-What kind of place is this?
-Wait--

20:15.214 --> 20:16.632
Dr. Yoon is there.

20:17.299 --> 20:20.802
Right. Did you hear?
Gang-uk is getting married.

20:20.886 --> 20:23.680
His fiancée is four years our junior,
Park Min-ji.

20:23.764 --> 20:25.557
Myeongin Hospital director's daughter.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.476
I heard the families are close.

20:27.559 --> 20:30.145
Maybe this is a sensitive topic.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.064
Why not? They just briefly dated.

20:33.023 --> 20:35.442
Hey, I'm totally fine.

20:35.525 --> 20:37.819
Tell them I wish them
a happy married life.

20:39.029 --> 20:41.740
Do you have any plans to get married?

20:41.823 --> 20:45.285
Come on. That's a bit rude
to ask someone who's single.

20:45.369 --> 20:47.704
-I do have a boyfriend.
-Ms. Dentist.

20:48.580 --> 20:51.208
-Hey.
-Speak of the devil.

20:51.291 --> 20:54.461
-"Ms. Dentist."
-Hey, I don't like them.

20:54.544 --> 20:57.381
What? What are you saying?

20:59.591 --> 21:01.510
-Who…
-Hello.

21:01.593 --> 21:04.012
We went to college with Hye-jin.

21:04.638 --> 21:06.556
I see. Hello.

21:06.640 --> 21:10.185
Goodness, he's the guy from that photo.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.937
-So he lives here.
-Photo?

21:12.020 --> 21:14.481
-The guy who was chasing you--
-That's not true.

21:14.564 --> 21:16.942
-Chasing?
-What are you talking about?

21:17.025 --> 21:18.777
We're dating now.

21:19.695 --> 21:20.779
Sit down, <i>oppa</i>.

21:20.862 --> 21:22.030
<i>"Oppa."</i>

21:22.114 --> 21:23.448
-Sit down.
-Sit, <i>oppa.</i>

21:23.532 --> 21:25.826
Sit down, <i>oppa</i>. He's my boyfriend.

21:27.703 --> 21:29.621
He looks different today.

21:29.705 --> 21:34.459
How do I put it?
He looks healthy and strong.

21:35.002 --> 21:38.463
Right. We're going to go golfing tomorrow.
Would you like to join us?

21:38.547 --> 21:41.883
A friend of ours was going to come,
but they bailed on us.

21:41.967 --> 21:45.429
Hey, it's too hot to play golf.
You'll collapse from the heat.

21:45.512 --> 21:47.347
But we already booked.

21:48.390 --> 21:50.475
Does he not know how to play golf?

21:50.559 --> 21:52.352
-Let's go.
-What?

21:52.436 --> 21:54.229
They invited us, so why not?

21:54.313 --> 21:56.356
I just need to hit the ball, right?

21:56.440 --> 21:57.482
Well…

21:58.608 --> 22:00.777
<i>-Oppa.</i>
-Why do you keep calling me that?

22:01.278 --> 22:02.612
I always call you that.

22:03.488 --> 22:04.781
I always call him that.

22:05.490 --> 22:06.700
I see.

22:11.204 --> 22:14.333
Why did you say you'd go?

22:14.416 --> 22:15.917
Do you know how to play golf?

22:16.001 --> 22:18.295
What's wrong? Worried I'll embarrass you?

22:18.879 --> 22:20.422
That's not why.

22:21.006 --> 22:24.009
They have totally
different values from you.

22:24.092 --> 22:26.219
I don't want you to get upset.

22:26.303 --> 22:29.473
Gosh, don't worry.
Things like that don't faze me.

22:30.140 --> 22:31.516
Through this opportunity,

22:31.600 --> 22:36.354
I'll show your narrow-minded friends
there are different values in life.

22:39.024 --> 22:40.108
You're impossible.

22:40.859 --> 22:42.861
Right. Do you even have golf clubs?

22:43.737 --> 22:45.030
Don't you worry. Come.

22:45.530 --> 22:48.200
You can always borrow them.
They lend those these days.

22:49.242 --> 22:51.995
Thanks for lending them
so early in the morning.

22:52.079 --> 22:53.997
I promise I'll use them carefully.

22:54.081 --> 22:56.500
Of course. These clubs weren't cheap.

22:56.583 --> 22:58.794
And I only wore this outfit once.

22:58.877 --> 23:01.171
They're just steel rods and worn clothes.

23:01.254 --> 23:02.756
Anyway, thanks.

23:03.840 --> 23:06.218
Gosh, this is heavy.

23:07.427 --> 23:09.179
Gosh. This is heavy.

23:09.679 --> 23:15.060
What kind of attitude is that
when he's the one borrowing?

23:16.645 --> 23:17.979
Darn it.

23:34.329 --> 23:35.330
Chief Hong.

23:35.413 --> 23:36.832
Thanks.

23:38.041 --> 23:38.959
Let's go.

23:39.042 --> 23:42.045
Hold on. I have one favor to ask.

23:42.129 --> 23:43.380
Sure. What is it?

23:43.463 --> 23:47.551
Can you please
use honorifics to my friends today?

23:48.385 --> 23:49.719
-That's--
-I know.

23:49.803 --> 23:53.014
I know you even treat
the elderly like they're your friends

23:53.098 --> 23:57.644
because you believe
everyone should be treated equally.

23:57.727 --> 24:03.608
But could you not do that
just for today? Please?

24:03.692 --> 24:04.985
But that's unlike me.

24:05.569 --> 24:06.444
Just for today.

24:11.825 --> 24:14.536
Hey, you're here early.

24:19.374 --> 24:22.794
-Hello.
-Hey-- Hello.

24:23.295 --> 24:24.796
-I'm Hong Du-sik.
-Gosh.

24:24.880 --> 24:28.425
I barely recognized you.
You look completely different.

24:28.508 --> 24:30.719
Oh, I was doing something
that day-- Ma'am.

24:32.596 --> 24:33.555
Can you golf?

24:33.638 --> 24:36.141
Yeah. I mean, yes.

24:36.224 --> 24:38.476
What are we doing here? Let's go inside.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.061
Sure. Let's go.

24:40.145 --> 24:41.062
Let's go.

24:44.524 --> 24:46.735
Good job. You're doing well.

24:46.818 --> 24:48.987
Just keep it up like now.

25:12.802 --> 25:14.179
He's pretty good.

25:18.558 --> 25:20.185
You're so happy.

25:22.896 --> 25:24.147
Nice.

25:28.485 --> 25:29.736
I'm better than her.

25:33.740 --> 25:34.824
I'll go first.

25:46.670 --> 25:47.837
Thank you.

25:58.765 --> 25:59.933
That's par.

26:05.897 --> 26:06.982
No way.

26:08.566 --> 26:09.442
Thank you.

26:15.615 --> 26:17.033
He never misses.

26:17.117 --> 26:18.410
You're really good.

26:21.246 --> 26:22.789
-Did you see that?
-Thanks.

26:23.540 --> 26:25.041
You were incredible.

26:25.125 --> 26:27.502
-You could become a pro golfer.
-Thank…

26:27.585 --> 26:28.753
Thank you.

26:28.837 --> 26:31.506
He's good at lots of things.

26:31.589 --> 26:33.133
He has so many talents.

26:33.216 --> 26:36.303
He surfs and is even a certified barista.

26:36.970 --> 26:38.930
He knows how to enjoy life.

26:39.014 --> 26:40.974
That's admirable.

26:41.057 --> 26:44.185
They say smart people are athletic, right?

26:44.269 --> 26:46.229
He graduated from SNU

26:46.313 --> 26:47.605
and is athletic.

26:47.689 --> 26:49.983
Goodness. You're from SNU?

26:50.066 --> 26:53.236
May I ask what you do for a living?

26:54.696 --> 26:58.658
Well, I paint,
brew coffee, and sail a boat.

26:58.742 --> 27:01.995
-I don't have a specific job right now.
-Sorry?

27:02.078 --> 27:05.874
I chose to lead my own life
instead of being led by someone else.

27:05.957 --> 27:10.795
Change your view on life just a bit,
and this lifestyle will bring you joy.

27:10.879 --> 27:12.881
Is this what they call YOLO?

27:12.964 --> 27:15.675
-Yes, something like that.
-I see.

27:15.759 --> 27:19.929
You only live once,
and I already have everything that I need.

27:20.430 --> 27:23.558
A comfortable bed
I'll be sleeping in tonight,

27:23.641 --> 27:25.435
a sturdy surfboard,

27:26.603 --> 27:28.438
and the love of my life.

27:28.521 --> 27:31.691
Goodness, you're so romantic.

27:31.775 --> 27:32.859
I agree.

27:33.985 --> 27:34.903
I envy you.

27:38.406 --> 27:40.200
You have a wonderful boyfriend.

27:40.283 --> 27:43.036
Unlike the cocky guys I've met recently.

27:43.870 --> 27:45.872
Really? Thanks.

27:45.955 --> 27:49.542
By the way,
are you even thinking about marrying him?

27:50.085 --> 27:52.545
-What?
-Unless you won't get married at all,

27:52.629 --> 27:55.507
people our age
should think that far when dating.

27:56.966 --> 27:58.593
You must be in a dilemma.

27:58.676 --> 28:01.679
He seems like a great guy,
but you still need to be realistic.

28:01.763 --> 28:02.972
That's true.

28:11.856 --> 28:14.651
Electric cars sure are nice.

28:14.734 --> 28:17.570
They should really improve
the charging infrastructure.

28:17.654 --> 28:19.989
I'll go to the city hall soon and ask them

28:20.073 --> 28:21.783
to install more chargers.

28:22.450 --> 28:23.743
I'd be grateful.

28:23.827 --> 28:25.036
Gosh.

28:25.662 --> 28:27.247
Can I ask you a question?

28:27.330 --> 28:28.873
I know you're still going to ask.

28:29.499 --> 28:34.129
When did you first decide
to live this lifestyle?

28:35.004 --> 28:38.299
-What?
-Something must've triggered you.

28:38.383 --> 28:39.717
I'm sure you're aware

28:39.801 --> 28:43.304
of all those rumors
about those five years.

28:44.514 --> 28:45.348
I am.

28:46.099 --> 28:47.851
Don't you think you can tell me now?

28:50.353 --> 28:53.815
So I came up with a few hypotheses.

28:54.691 --> 28:55.692
Number one.

28:56.818 --> 29:00.697
You were the winner of
that lottery ticket from Bora Supermarket.

29:01.865 --> 29:02.949
Look at you smiling.

29:03.992 --> 29:05.827
That's your hope, not a hypothesis.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.496
I didn't even live in Gongjin then.

29:08.580 --> 29:11.082
I see. You weren't here.

29:11.166 --> 29:12.250
You look disappointed.

29:12.333 --> 29:13.793
-I'm not.
-I can tell.

29:13.877 --> 29:15.503
-You're wrong.
-No, I'm right.

29:15.587 --> 29:16.838
No, you're wrong!

29:17.338 --> 29:19.507
Why do you keep
making me look superficial?

29:20.216 --> 29:21.634
You're so annoying.

29:22.385 --> 29:24.053
Me? Did I do that

29:24.637 --> 29:25.513
to you?

29:28.016 --> 29:29.017
All right.

29:34.481 --> 29:37.776
You were a genius CEO
like Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg.

29:37.859 --> 29:38.777
No.

29:38.860 --> 29:42.030
Then were you an assemblyman's aide
who decided to live here

29:42.113 --> 29:44.157
after being let down by politics?

29:44.240 --> 29:45.575
That's not it.

29:45.658 --> 29:48.828
Are you an illegitimate child
of a wealthy family?

29:48.912 --> 29:50.497
Don't you speak ill of my grandpa.

29:51.456 --> 29:52.582
Sorry.

30:00.423 --> 30:01.549
Want some?

30:01.633 --> 30:03.510
Were you a secret agent?

30:04.469 --> 30:05.720
As if.

30:07.096 --> 30:09.015
A spy sent to North Korea?

30:09.849 --> 30:11.768
Does that make sense to you?

30:11.851 --> 30:14.187
How could none
of your hypotheses be realistic?

30:14.270 --> 30:17.398
Then what on earth happened?
Why won't you tell me?

30:19.442 --> 30:23.279
I told you.
I don't want any secrets between us.

30:25.782 --> 30:26.866
Are you that curious?

30:27.659 --> 30:28.660
I am.

30:33.581 --> 30:34.958
I just had a desk job.

30:35.917 --> 30:36.876
Nothing special.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.002
A desk job?

30:40.004 --> 30:42.090
Then why didn't you tell me sooner?

30:45.093 --> 30:47.971
This feels a bit unfair.

30:48.054 --> 30:51.933
I thought you had
a huge secret or something.

30:52.016 --> 30:53.560
But you just had a desk job?

30:54.435 --> 30:55.353
Yes.

30:57.814 --> 31:01.484
Which company did you work for?
There are various companies out there.

31:01.568 --> 31:03.987
Why does it matter
when I no longer work there?

31:05.738 --> 31:07.615
Well, you see…

31:09.200 --> 31:12.704
Do you have any plans to return to Seoul?

31:13.288 --> 31:15.164
Not really. I like it here.

31:15.748 --> 31:18.626
Right. It is nice.

31:18.710 --> 31:21.754
What is it? Do you still want to go back?

31:21.838 --> 31:23.840
Well… Not right now.

31:24.674 --> 31:29.304
I'm not saying
I want to go back to Seoul right now.

31:29.387 --> 31:33.558
I'm just saying
there's a possibility of going back.

31:33.641 --> 31:35.184
Right, that's possible.

31:38.646 --> 31:40.773
All that golfing has made me famished.

31:41.399 --> 31:42.400
Want some noodles?

31:43.276 --> 31:44.277
Sure.

31:44.861 --> 31:48.698
I'll cook some eggs
and add it as a pretty garnish.

32:04.923 --> 32:05.965
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

32:06.049 --> 32:08.801
-Can you refill our side dishes?
-Which ones?

32:08.885 --> 32:11.179
-Fried shrimp.
-And bean sprouts.

32:11.262 --> 32:13.139
-And some bell peppers too.
-Sure.

32:13.222 --> 32:15.224
-Thank you.
-I'll get them right away.

32:21.272 --> 32:25.485
YEO HWA-JEONG

32:27.028 --> 32:28.154
All right.

32:29.489 --> 32:31.616
-Okay.
-Hello.

32:32.408 --> 32:34.410
Hey, take a photo.

32:34.494 --> 32:36.079
-A photo?
-Yes.

32:37.956 --> 32:40.208
Don't look at the camera.

32:40.291 --> 32:41.334
Move a bit back.

32:44.337 --> 32:45.546
That's good.

32:47.298 --> 32:50.843
The filming ended ages ago,
so why is this still in here?

32:51.928 --> 32:53.388
There's still everything inside.

32:54.764 --> 33:00.061
Let's see. The paper with my name on it
that she crumpled up is…

33:00.728 --> 33:02.730
YEO HWA-JEONG

33:05.608 --> 33:10.196
YEO HWA-JEONG

33:16.244 --> 33:18.329
-Thank you.
-Eat lots.

33:21.040 --> 33:22.250
Darn it.

33:23.418 --> 33:25.628
How could she still care for me
after everything?

33:27.714 --> 33:30.550
Why did she do it for me
when she should despise me?

33:39.809 --> 33:40.643
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

33:40.727 --> 33:43.855
I'll do the dishes.
You can stop here and call it a day.

33:43.938 --> 33:45.231
You said your back hurt.

33:45.314 --> 33:47.900
I don't think
there are any more customers today.

33:47.984 --> 33:49.527
Let's just wrap up early today.

33:49.610 --> 33:52.989
No. I'm going to wait
for more customers and make more money.

33:54.907 --> 33:56.701
-Fine, then. I'll go first.
-Go on.

33:56.784 --> 33:58.536
Good work today. Bye.

33:58.619 --> 34:00.204
You too.

34:14.093 --> 34:16.888
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

34:25.980 --> 34:26.981
Gosh.

34:27.982 --> 34:29.817
When did I doze off?

34:39.577 --> 34:40.745
Let's see.

34:41.829 --> 34:43.414
The dishes are done.

34:43.498 --> 34:45.291
Did she come back and do them?

34:59.722 --> 35:01.140
I enjoyed the movie.

35:01.224 --> 35:02.225
Me too.

35:02.809 --> 35:04.185
I looked it up beforehand.

35:04.268 --> 35:06.687
It was the most popular movie nowadays.

35:06.771 --> 35:07.772
I see.

35:10.983 --> 35:12.276
I liked the pasta too.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.737
They're known for their ambiance.

35:14.821 --> 35:19.117
It's the number one go-to restaurant
in Chung-ho when you're on a date.

35:19.200 --> 35:22.203
I see. Did you look that place up as well?

35:22.286 --> 35:23.329
Yes.

35:24.372 --> 35:27.583
I'm a bit tacky
and don't know much about these things.

35:27.667 --> 35:29.502
I didn't want to disappoint you.

35:30.253 --> 35:32.046
I'll keep improving.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.714
I'll do better.

35:36.759 --> 35:37.802
Eun-cheol.

35:41.931 --> 35:43.558
You don't need to improve.

35:45.017 --> 35:45.852
What?

35:46.602 --> 35:49.272
Even if I watch a terrible movie,

35:49.355 --> 35:51.941
I'll still enjoy it
if I watch it with you.

35:52.024 --> 35:56.404
And remember that
spicy stir-fried pork with rice we had?

35:56.487 --> 35:58.447
It was really delicious.

36:03.786 --> 36:04.787
Really?

36:06.831 --> 36:08.916
There's no manual for dating.

36:10.001 --> 36:12.879
Just follow your heart.

36:21.929 --> 36:24.140
I'm sorry for hugging you
before holding hands.

36:25.099 --> 36:27.268
I was going to take it slowly,

36:28.519 --> 36:32.273
but you said there was no manual.

36:36.777 --> 36:37.778
Okay.

36:38.696 --> 36:39.989
Well done.

36:40.615 --> 36:43.034
You're quite the smart one.

36:44.243 --> 36:46.037
I bet you could skip more bases.

37:14.357 --> 37:17.985
Do you have any plans to return to Seoul?

37:19.153 --> 37:21.072
Not really. I like it here.

37:22.490 --> 37:23.783
Right. It is nice.

37:23.866 --> 37:27.036
What is it? Do you still want to go back?

37:28.329 --> 37:31.415
He could've said we could go back together
even if he didn't mean it.

38:18.921 --> 38:21.757
I feel so awkward
because I've never worn a suit before.

38:21.841 --> 38:25.469
-Seon-a, look at me. Do I look okay?
-Yes?

38:26.262 --> 38:29.140
Gosh, you look really nice.

38:29.223 --> 38:30.975
-Really?
-Yes.

38:41.986 --> 38:44.071
I couldn't even throw it away.

38:55.875 --> 38:58.336
<i>Typhoon Gaia, approaching from the south,</i>

38:58.419 --> 39:01.839
<i>is expected to strike
Gangwon Province this afternoon.</i>

39:01.922 --> 39:04.050
<i>According to
the Gangwon Meteorological Office…</i>

39:04.133 --> 39:05.885
-Hey.
-Hey, you're here.

39:05.968 --> 39:08.429
Yes. Why did you call?
What's the emergency?

39:08.512 --> 39:10.890
Could you bring in the fruit from outside?

39:10.973 --> 39:13.351
I managed to put them there,
but they're too heavy.

39:13.434 --> 39:16.312
Why did you go through that hassle
when a typhoon is coming?

39:16.395 --> 39:20.107
I wanted to sell as much fruit as possible
since we're open today.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.151
Why are you being so greedy?

39:23.027 --> 39:24.904
<i>There will be at most 300mm of rain…</i>

39:26.781 --> 39:28.324
That's a lot.

39:28.407 --> 39:30.117
You put out all sorts of fruits.

39:30.826 --> 39:32.745
Can't you just be nice and help me?

39:32.828 --> 39:35.122
I will. I never said I wouldn't.

39:53.516 --> 39:55.309
Green tea? No coffee?

39:55.393 --> 39:58.104
No. The coffee maker here is broken.

39:59.188 --> 40:00.314
Then…

40:02.108 --> 40:04.151
How about this?
This will help wake you up.

40:04.235 --> 40:05.194
Okay.

40:18.999 --> 40:22.628
Now we only have one more shoot left.
Time flies.

40:23.170 --> 40:24.171
You're right.

40:24.672 --> 40:28.384
Will you be working on
the next variety show right away?

40:28.467 --> 40:30.761
Are you nuts? I'm going to take a break.

40:31.554 --> 40:34.515
Thanks to someone,
I barely rested for the past few years.

40:35.516 --> 40:38.269
A show would end,
and I'd think about going on a trip.

40:38.352 --> 40:41.856
But then you'd call every 30 seconds
and spitball new ideas.

40:42.398 --> 40:46.068
One time, you even flew
to where I was. Was it Rome?

40:46.152 --> 40:48.028
No, it was Florence.

40:48.112 --> 40:49.238
Right.

40:49.905 --> 40:52.825
Hey, I couldn't even visit
the cathedral and stayed up all night

40:52.908 --> 40:54.493
brainstorming with you.

40:54.577 --> 40:58.038
He's the worst.
Who is that? He's so awful.

40:58.122 --> 40:59.457
He's unbelievable.

41:00.332 --> 41:02.877
Why did you continue working with him?

41:03.502 --> 41:04.628
Because I enjoyed it.

41:07.214 --> 41:08.132
You see,

41:09.258 --> 41:13.971
it felt like I was doodling
on an invisible sketchbook with you.

41:14.054 --> 41:16.599
We'd come up with ridiculous ideas.

41:17.266 --> 41:21.770
Then suddenly, there would be a spark,
and we'd find our next idea.

41:22.605 --> 41:24.023
It was electrifying.

41:24.607 --> 41:27.735
But? Are there no more sparks now?

41:27.818 --> 41:29.069
There are.

41:30.863 --> 41:32.323
There are sparks all the time.

41:33.115 --> 41:34.241
That's the problem.

41:38.787 --> 41:41.207
Unbelievable. What are the odds?

41:41.749 --> 41:44.251
That really surprised me.
I thought it was intentional.

41:44.335 --> 41:45.920
I almost got a heart attack.

41:47.379 --> 41:48.923
-Pick up.
-What?

41:49.924 --> 41:50.841
Right.

41:51.509 --> 41:52.885
Hello?

41:54.512 --> 41:57.723
Hey. It's been ages.

41:58.974 --> 41:59.934
How's Ha-rang doing?

42:06.774 --> 42:07.858
Is that all?

42:08.359 --> 42:10.027
Yes. Thank you.

42:13.614 --> 42:16.325
Honey, could you stay here
while I go to the bathroom?

42:16.408 --> 42:17.826
Okay.

42:17.910 --> 42:20.621
The baby is pressing down on my bladder.

42:26.794 --> 42:29.088
Honey, can you tie my shoelaces?

42:29.171 --> 42:32.174
Sweetie, can't you see
that I'm drinking water right now?

42:35.719 --> 42:37.012
You're not a kid.

42:37.596 --> 42:42.226
So why would you ask me
to tie your shoelaces?

42:50.067 --> 42:51.068
Are you crying?

42:53.404 --> 42:55.030
Why are you crying?

42:55.114 --> 42:57.199
-Okay. I'll tie them for you.
-Forget it.

42:57.283 --> 42:59.535
-I'll tie them right now.
-No, forget it.

42:59.618 --> 43:02.288
Come on. Are you sulking…

43:04.331 --> 43:05.457
You are.

43:06.792 --> 43:08.794
This is all because of the hormones.

43:08.877 --> 43:11.547
Our baby needs to come out
for you to be comfortable.

43:13.591 --> 43:14.592
What?

43:15.843 --> 43:18.470
Comfortable? Are you serious right now?

43:19.346 --> 43:21.974
What is it? Did I say something wrong?

43:22.057 --> 43:23.934
Do you think childbirth is easy?

43:24.018 --> 43:26.020
My body gets ripped in the process.

43:26.103 --> 43:29.940
It feels like all the bones in my body
are broken then mended again!

43:30.024 --> 43:31.692
-You see, I--
-Imagine

43:31.775 --> 43:34.903
breastfeeding late at night in that state.

43:34.987 --> 43:38.032
Breastfeeding, putting it to bed,
changing its diaper…

43:38.616 --> 43:41.327
But what?
I'll be comfortable after giving birth?

43:42.202 --> 43:44.121
Is raising a baby a joke to you?

43:44.204 --> 43:45.456
I never said that.

43:45.539 --> 43:47.958
And I'm being greedy?

43:49.668 --> 43:52.338
Do you think
I work this hard just for myself?

43:52.421 --> 43:54.006
I also don't want to work.

43:55.215 --> 43:58.510
I'm exhausted because our baby
is weighing me down. I want to rest!

43:58.594 --> 44:01.347
Okay, Yun-gyeong. I'm sorry.

44:01.430 --> 44:03.140
Gosh, you and your words.

44:04.391 --> 44:07.144
I'm the only one lonely and scared.

44:07.227 --> 44:09.355
You're just a bystander.

44:09.438 --> 44:11.607
You have no idea how much I struggle.

44:11.690 --> 44:15.194
My hands and feet are swollen,
my back hurts,

44:15.277 --> 44:16.987
and I can't bend forward.

44:17.071 --> 44:18.447
I just can't!

44:18.530 --> 44:21.659
That's why I can't tie
these stupid shoelaces!

44:21.742 --> 44:23.494
-I'm--
-Do you know how that feels?

44:23.577 --> 44:24.995
I said I'm sorry.

44:25.079 --> 44:26.997
Okay? I'll tie them right now.

44:27.081 --> 44:28.957
Forget it and just leave.

44:29.041 --> 44:31.669
I don't want to see you, so just leave.

44:31.752 --> 44:33.629
What's the matter with you?

44:33.712 --> 44:36.882
I can't stand being
in the same room with you. Go!

44:36.965 --> 44:38.133
-Leave!
-Come on!

44:38.217 --> 44:40.427
-What's wrong with you?
-Get out!

44:40.511 --> 44:43.222
Fine! I'll leave! Darn it.

44:43.305 --> 44:44.431
I'm leaving!

44:56.026 --> 44:56.860
Darn it.

44:57.986 --> 45:00.406
You're such an asshole!

45:03.158 --> 45:06.370
Is it so hard to tie shoelaces for me?

45:11.500 --> 45:12.876
It's quite windy.

45:14.169 --> 45:16.213
I should prepare in advance.

45:19.591 --> 45:21.051
Gosh, it's too high up.

45:27.808 --> 45:29.518
I should hurry.

45:36.275 --> 45:37.985
-Goodness.
-Hey!

45:55.627 --> 45:56.879
What's wrong with you?

45:57.463 --> 45:59.965
I told you to be more careful!

46:00.048 --> 46:01.717
What the hell are you yelling for?

46:01.800 --> 46:03.093
You almost got hurt!

46:04.261 --> 46:05.471
That was nothing!

46:05.554 --> 46:07.639
Gosh! Put me down.

46:07.723 --> 46:09.099
I was about to anyway.

46:11.768 --> 46:14.396
-Why are you here?
-I heard a typhoon was coming,

46:14.480 --> 46:17.274
so I wanted to check on I-jun and stuff.

46:18.317 --> 46:20.736
I-jun went to play the claw machine
with Bo-ra.

46:20.819 --> 46:22.779
I see. Claw machine.

46:27.367 --> 46:29.244
If you're going to wait, hold the chair.

46:29.328 --> 46:32.623
No, step back. I'll do it.

46:42.090 --> 46:44.259
Why would you rip today's newspaper?

46:44.343 --> 46:45.844
I didn't even read it yet!

46:46.845 --> 46:47.930
Well…

46:49.389 --> 46:50.641
Hold on.

47:00.567 --> 47:02.277
Gosh, it's so windy.

47:09.535 --> 47:10.536
Drink.

47:11.328 --> 47:12.287
Thanks.

47:18.710 --> 47:22.339
I heard taping the windows is of no use.

47:22.422 --> 47:25.050
You should put newspaper
between the window frames.

47:25.592 --> 47:28.512
Listen carefully. You see.

47:29.346 --> 47:32.474
You can barely hear
the windows shaking, right?

47:35.519 --> 47:38.021
You never skip the chance
to compliment yourself.

47:38.772 --> 47:41.692
It's so unlike you
to do the dishes without telling me.

47:52.286 --> 47:54.246
Why's she dozing off here?

48:38.498 --> 48:40.375
<i>How did you know it was me?</i>

48:40.459 --> 48:44.546
<i>How could I not?
There was foam left all over the sink,</i>

48:44.630 --> 48:47.633
<i>and the dish towels were twisted in lumps.</i>

48:47.716 --> 48:50.927
Didn't I tell you
to spray the sink with water

48:51.011 --> 48:54.264
and hang the dish towels
so that they won't stink?

48:54.931 --> 48:57.267
How do you still remember that?

48:59.227 --> 49:01.813
I only remember
all the annoying things you did.

49:07.319 --> 49:08.528
I'm sorry.

49:12.783 --> 49:14.910
I was a terrible husband in many ways.

49:19.956 --> 49:21.166
What's gotten into you?

49:22.834 --> 49:24.461
I didn't poison your coffee.

49:26.338 --> 49:27.506
I mean it.

49:32.469 --> 49:35.389
And I have something serious to tell you.

49:40.560 --> 49:44.731
About that man
Ms. Joo told you about the other day…

49:46.900 --> 49:48.902
A judicial scrivener, was he?

49:50.320 --> 49:52.989
It seems he's a decent guy.
You should give him a chance.

49:54.700 --> 49:56.493
You want me to go on a blind date?

50:00.247 --> 50:02.332
Not all men are like me.

50:03.625 --> 50:05.502
You deserve to meet someone nice

50:06.086 --> 50:08.296
and live a happy life.

50:12.676 --> 50:13.719
You're done, right?

50:14.469 --> 50:15.387
Then leave.

50:15.470 --> 50:17.723
Hey, I didn't even have a single sip.

50:17.806 --> 50:20.142
So that's what you wanted to talk about?

50:20.767 --> 50:22.853
I already agreed to meet him soon.

50:23.478 --> 50:24.688
What?

50:27.691 --> 50:28.692
I see.

50:29.985 --> 50:30.986
Good.

50:32.070 --> 50:35.532
Mom! Dad, you're here too.

50:35.615 --> 50:39.745
-Hello.
-Hey. I came to see you, I-jun.

50:39.828 --> 50:41.997
-Did you two have a fun time?
-Yes.

50:42.497 --> 50:43.498
What did you win?

50:43.582 --> 50:46.084
We didn't play it and just had ice cream.

50:46.168 --> 50:48.086
-You had ice cream?
-Yes.

50:48.170 --> 50:49.755
-Was it delicious?
-Yes.

50:51.506 --> 50:52.966
Will you play tomorrow too?

50:53.049 --> 50:54.885
Of course.

50:55.844 --> 50:57.095
YOON HYE-JIN

51:00.891 --> 51:02.768
Ding-dong.

51:03.435 --> 51:04.519
Get out.

51:06.271 --> 51:07.981
But I just came.

51:08.064 --> 51:10.525
Aren't you being harsh to a guest?

51:10.609 --> 51:12.319
I prefer a typhoon to you.

51:13.612 --> 51:14.821
Why are you here?

51:14.905 --> 51:17.282
I'm taking refuge
from my wife's terrifying nagging.

51:17.365 --> 51:18.617
What did you do this time?

51:18.700 --> 51:20.577
Why are you so sure it was my fault?

51:20.660 --> 51:22.204
Yes, you're probably at fault.

51:22.704 --> 51:26.875
Fine, I am. But she got way angrier
than she should have.

51:27.501 --> 51:29.836
Do you know what I'm going through?

51:29.920 --> 51:33.340
She said I was useless and didn't want
to be in the same room as me.

51:33.423 --> 51:34.841
She had probably bottled it up.

51:34.925 --> 51:37.469
She did overwork herself.
It's been hard for her.

51:38.053 --> 51:39.888
-Are you my father-in-law?
-Hey.

51:39.971 --> 51:42.349
She used to know everyone
in this neighborhood.

51:42.891 --> 51:44.559
She was friends with everyone.

51:44.643 --> 51:47.229
But what about now? How is she?

51:47.312 --> 51:50.398
She's busy working, raising Bo-ra,
and even has a baby on the way.

51:51.149 --> 51:55.320
She's fulfilled her role as a wife
and a mom, but what about herself?

51:56.071 --> 51:58.114
Don't you remember what she did

51:58.198 --> 51:59.950
when she got pregnant with Bo-ra?

52:01.409 --> 52:02.828
She proposed to you.

52:02.911 --> 52:07.290
She must've been more scared than
you were, but she wanted to make it work.

52:10.001 --> 52:14.714
Geum-cheol, it doesn't mean
that she's more mature than you.

52:15.799 --> 52:18.885
She's still young,
so it must be hard for her.

52:19.803 --> 52:21.429
So what should you do?

52:21.513 --> 52:24.474
What an annoying bastard.
You only say the right things.

52:24.558 --> 52:25.934
Then get lost.

52:26.017 --> 52:27.477
I was about to anyway.

52:27.561 --> 52:30.397
-Go straight home.
-I have nowhere else to go anyway.

52:32.566 --> 52:33.608
Your umbrella.

52:35.026 --> 52:36.361
He'll manage.

52:46.872 --> 52:48.957
POST

52:54.588 --> 52:56.089
BORA SUPERMARKET

52:56.172 --> 52:57.090
Hello.

53:02.470 --> 53:03.889
Hello.

53:03.972 --> 53:05.974
Don't worry about this. I'll clean it up.

53:06.057 --> 53:08.310
No, please sit down. Let me.

53:15.400 --> 53:17.986
Would you like me to tie your shoelaces?

53:18.069 --> 53:20.071
It must be difficult to bend forward.

53:20.822 --> 53:22.073
Thank you.

53:34.711 --> 53:37.172
Did something happen?

53:37.255 --> 53:39.758
Gosh. No, I'm fine.

53:40.675 --> 53:43.511
I just envy you, that's all.

53:44.512 --> 53:46.222
I know it's wrong of me to do so.

53:46.306 --> 53:48.099
Why would you envy me all of a sudden?

53:48.183 --> 53:49.017
It's just that

53:50.226 --> 53:52.520
I feel so sorry for myself these days.

53:53.271 --> 53:55.482
But you're living your own life.

53:56.566 --> 53:59.027
You have a well-respected job

53:59.110 --> 54:01.279
and are having fun dating a guy.

54:02.280 --> 54:04.282
But I find your life more admirable.

54:04.866 --> 54:07.661
What? What makes you think that?

54:07.744 --> 54:11.164
Childrearing is definitely not easy.

54:12.457 --> 54:17.587
But you've already been doing that
for some time now,

54:17.671 --> 54:19.798
and you're doing a really good job.

54:21.591 --> 54:23.718
I truly respect you for that.

54:25.387 --> 54:29.099
Yes, you're right. Our Bo-ra is…

54:30.725 --> 54:32.060
quite amazing.

54:32.143 --> 54:33.561
I agree.

54:38.817 --> 54:40.151
What's wrong?

54:40.735 --> 54:41.903
What should I do?

54:42.904 --> 54:44.572
I think my water broke.

54:44.656 --> 54:45.490
What?

54:57.168 --> 54:58.169
What is that?

55:02.674 --> 55:05.969
Gosh, that bastard left his phone.

55:06.553 --> 55:07.387
Let's see.

55:10.890 --> 55:13.935
-Hello?
-Hello, Mr. Choi.

55:14.936 --> 55:15.854
Ms. Dentist?

55:16.563 --> 55:18.690
Why are you answering?

55:19.274 --> 55:21.818
Geum-cheol left his phone at my house.

55:22.402 --> 55:25.196
Really? Oh, no.

55:25.280 --> 55:27.949
Then can you come
to the supermarket this instant?

55:28.575 --> 55:30.452
Why? What's the matter?

55:31.578 --> 55:34.372
-Gosh, that hurts.
-I'm sorry!

55:34.456 --> 55:38.710
You see, Yun-gyeong's water broke.

55:40.420 --> 55:41.921
I'm on my way.

55:51.931 --> 55:53.600
Come out. Put the umbrella up.

56:00.774 --> 56:01.858
Watch out.

56:04.194 --> 56:05.195
I'm closing the door.

56:09.449 --> 56:11.242
-Can you manage?
-Yes.

56:11.326 --> 56:14.120
But the contractions are getting
shorter and shorter.

56:14.204 --> 56:15.246
Really?

56:17.332 --> 56:18.333
Hold on.

56:24.964 --> 56:26.758
<i>Hello? Hey, Du-sik.</i>

56:26.841 --> 56:31.137
Hello? Hey, Eun-cheol. It's me.
Do you know where your brother is?

56:31.221 --> 56:33.640
<i>-No. What's the matter?</i>
-Choi Geum-cheol, you bastard.

56:34.808 --> 56:36.768
Yun-gyeong is going into labor.

56:36.851 --> 56:39.062
I'm heading to the hospital right now.

56:39.145 --> 56:40.730
If you can reach him, tell him--

56:40.814 --> 56:45.110
<i>Songjin is blocked due to a rockslide.
The roads here are flooded too.</i>

56:45.193 --> 56:47.821
What? Then when will we have access?

56:47.904 --> 56:51.074
<i>I can't say.
The rain is pouring down for a while.</i>

56:52.367 --> 56:54.869
<i>It's no use calling an ambulance too.</i>

56:54.953 --> 56:56.329
Okay. Let me hang up.

57:01.126 --> 57:04.379
-Yun-gyeong, how far along are you?
-Yes?

57:04.462 --> 57:05.839
I'm at 39 weeks.

57:06.548 --> 57:07.966
How much does the baby weigh?

57:09.217 --> 57:11.511
Last week, the doctor said it weighed 3kg.

57:12.095 --> 57:13.513
It's not a breech baby, is it?

57:13.596 --> 57:15.974
Did you have
gestational diabetes or preeclampsia?

57:16.057 --> 57:17.183
No.

57:17.976 --> 57:20.645
Chief Hong, start the car.
Let's go to my house.

57:20.728 --> 57:22.981
-What?
-She can't give birth here.

57:23.064 --> 57:24.941
But you're a dentist.

57:25.984 --> 57:27.694
It's better than nothing.

57:28.653 --> 57:29.946
Hurry up.

57:31.406 --> 57:33.575
BORA SUPERMARKET

57:33.658 --> 57:36.035
It's really windy.

57:37.412 --> 57:41.708
Compared to the typhoon I had
back in the day, this is nothing.

57:41.791 --> 57:45.795
Which one? Are you talking
about Rusa from 20 years back?

57:45.879 --> 57:51.384
No, there was a terrifying one
back in 1959.

57:51.468 --> 57:53.303
What was the name again?

57:53.386 --> 57:56.055
-Sarah.
-That's right.

57:56.139 --> 57:57.140
Sarah.

58:03.062 --> 58:03.897
Hello?

58:03.980 --> 58:06.024
Grandma, it's me.

58:06.107 --> 58:09.319
Yun-gyeong is about to give birth.

58:12.030 --> 58:13.323
What did you say?

58:13.907 --> 58:16.367
But we can't go to the hospital right now,

58:16.868 --> 58:18.953
so Ms. Dentist will be
delivering the baby.

58:19.037 --> 58:21.789
Back in the day,
you all gave birth at home. Any tips?

58:21.873 --> 58:24.250
Let me talk to her.

58:24.834 --> 58:25.668
Here.

58:26.461 --> 58:29.380
Hello, I'm listening.
You're on speakerphone.

58:29.464 --> 58:33.259
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

58:38.973 --> 58:41.518
What's going on?
Why didn't she lock the door?

58:41.601 --> 58:43.311
And why are the lights out?

58:44.354 --> 58:47.148
Did she go home already
because of the rain?

59:00.078 --> 59:01.746
Hey, Yun-gyeong--

59:06.376 --> 59:10.463
Yun-gyeong, I may not be an OB-GYN doctor,

59:10.547 --> 59:12.298
but Ms. Kim told me what to do.

59:12.382 --> 59:14.676
And I also studied anatomy as a freshman.

59:14.759 --> 59:17.178
I'll do my best, so don't worry too much.

59:17.762 --> 59:18.638
Okay.

59:19.639 --> 59:21.266
My baby is in your care.

59:21.766 --> 59:24.852
-Do you know the Lamaze breathing method?
-Yes.

59:27.021 --> 59:28.565
There are three steps.

59:28.648 --> 59:31.526
Inhale twice through your nose,
and exhale through your mouth.

59:42.453 --> 59:43.663
-Come in.
-Okay.

59:44.330 --> 59:46.457
Where the hell have you been?

59:46.541 --> 59:49.002
-Where's Yun-gyeong?
-She's in labor.

59:49.085 --> 59:51.421
-Yun-gyeong!
-Hey, wash your hands first.

59:51.504 --> 59:54.132
-The bathroom is that way.
-Okay. Take this.

1:00:04.309 --> 1:00:07.186
Yun-gyeong! Are you okay?

1:00:07.812 --> 1:00:11.858
Where have you been?
I've been waiting for you!

1:00:11.941 --> 1:00:14.110
I'm sorry, Yun-gyeong.

1:00:14.193 --> 1:00:17.655
I went to buy your favorite fruit.

1:00:18.448 --> 1:00:20.658
But then it started pouring.

1:00:20.742 --> 1:00:23.369
I was having contractions,
but you were nowhere to be seen.

1:00:24.162 --> 1:00:26.414
I was scared to death!

1:00:26.497 --> 1:00:29.334
Don't worry. Everything will be okay.

1:00:30.209 --> 1:00:33.379
You have me, okay?
I'll be right by your side.

1:00:33.463 --> 1:00:36.174
Dr. Yoon, may I stay in the room with her?

1:00:36.257 --> 1:00:37.634
Yes, you may.

1:00:38.217 --> 1:00:39.093
Yun-gyeong.

1:00:39.177 --> 1:00:43.598
Yun-gyeong, do the breathing again
and push a bit more.

1:00:46.225 --> 1:00:47.060
Good.

1:01:13.211 --> 1:01:14.796
Mom…

1:01:22.011 --> 1:01:23.513
Mom…

1:01:24.847 --> 1:01:26.724
Mom…

1:01:27.975 --> 1:01:30.645
Mom…

1:01:32.772 --> 1:01:34.273
Why are you out here?

1:01:35.274 --> 1:01:36.484
Did you wake up?

1:01:38.820 --> 1:01:40.697
What will happen to my mom?

1:01:41.864 --> 1:01:45.201
Don't worry. She'll be okay.

1:01:45.284 --> 1:01:49.956
I heard some ladies
saying childbirth is very painful.

1:01:50.998 --> 1:01:53.126
What if she dies?

1:01:53.793 --> 1:01:57.130
Mom…

1:01:57.797 --> 1:01:59.757
Mom…

1:02:05.638 --> 1:02:06.639
You know what?

1:02:07.140 --> 1:02:10.059
Make a wish when lightning flashes,
and it'll come true.

1:02:10.143 --> 1:02:11.936
-Really?
-Yes.

1:02:12.019 --> 1:02:15.565
I read it in a book.
So make your wish now.

1:02:18.818 --> 1:02:21.904
I pray that
my sibling will be born healthy.

1:02:23.364 --> 1:02:26.784
I pray that my mom won't be in pain.

1:02:27.785 --> 1:02:29.078
We beg you.

1:02:32.206 --> 1:02:37.420
What if the lightning
only grants one wish?

1:02:38.671 --> 1:02:42.008
Then let's pray again
when another one flashes.

1:02:56.314 --> 1:02:59.942
I pray that
my sibling will be born healthy.

1:03:01.110 --> 1:03:04.030
I pray that my mom won't be in pain.

1:03:04.113 --> 1:03:07.116
We beg you. Please.

1:03:18.461 --> 1:03:22.590
You son of a bitch!

1:03:29.472 --> 1:03:31.682
You crazy bastard!

1:03:32.266 --> 1:03:34.435
I told you it was too much

1:03:34.519 --> 1:03:38.022
and that we should only have one kid!

1:03:38.105 --> 1:03:43.361
Honey. Sweetie. Yun-gyeong.
Let go of this, please?

1:03:43.444 --> 1:03:45.696
Anything but the hair!

1:03:45.780 --> 1:03:48.449
You little prick!

1:03:48.533 --> 1:03:53.204
You convinced me to have another baby.

1:03:53.287 --> 1:03:57.542
How dare you ask for another baby
when I'm the one giving birth?

1:03:57.625 --> 1:04:00.253
Do you know
how much pain I'm in right now?

1:04:00.336 --> 1:04:03.881
Yun-gyeong, don't waste your strength
on him. You need to push.

1:04:03.965 --> 1:04:05.049
Push a bit more.

1:04:05.132 --> 1:04:08.135
-Yun-gyeong, listen to her.
-Squeeze.

1:04:08.219 --> 1:04:10.054
I've been losing a lot of hair lately.

1:04:10.137 --> 1:04:12.932
You know hair loss runs in my family.

1:04:13.015 --> 1:04:16.143
Yun-gyeong, you don't want to live
with a bald husband, do you?

1:04:16.227 --> 1:04:19.689
I don't care.
I'm going to kill you tonight.

1:04:22.191 --> 1:04:23.943
Don't waste your strength.

1:04:24.026 --> 1:04:25.361
Squeeze a bit more.

1:04:25.444 --> 1:04:28.614
Try giving birth yourself
and see if it's that easy to do!

1:04:29.407 --> 1:04:30.908
Just grab his hair.

1:04:37.373 --> 1:04:39.876
Yun-gyeong! I see the head!

1:04:39.959 --> 1:04:42.253
Squeeze for the last time!

1:05:09.155 --> 1:05:10.364
You did well.

1:05:10.448 --> 1:05:12.491
You did a great job, Yun-gyeong.

1:05:13.200 --> 1:05:14.201
-Honey.
-Yes?

1:05:14.285 --> 1:05:17.788
Our baby has
all ten fingers and toes, right?

1:05:17.872 --> 1:05:21.167
Of course. I already counted them.

1:05:22.084 --> 1:05:23.127
That's a relief.

1:05:30.593 --> 1:05:33.179
Honey. Are you crying?

1:05:34.972 --> 1:05:37.934
Yun-gyeong, I'm sorry.

1:05:39.268 --> 1:05:41.520
I was so inconsiderate

1:05:42.730 --> 1:05:46.400
and didn't know how painful
it was to give birth to our kids.

1:05:48.194 --> 1:05:50.071
I'm truly sorry.

1:05:50.154 --> 1:05:51.864
I'm all right. Okay?

1:05:52.823 --> 1:05:53.908
It was painful,

1:05:55.034 --> 1:05:57.036
but I got such a beautiful baby in return.

1:05:58.371 --> 1:05:59.246
Yun-gyeong.

1:06:00.247 --> 1:06:04.085
I'm sorry. And thank you.

1:06:04.168 --> 1:06:06.212
I'll treat you better. I promise, okay?

1:06:06.295 --> 1:06:09.674
Then promise me
you'll change our baby's diapers.

1:06:09.757 --> 1:06:13.928
I promise. I'll do it. I'll do everything.

1:06:16.514 --> 1:06:18.808
-Can you help me up?
-Sure.

1:06:18.891 --> 1:06:21.978
Shouldn't you be lying down?

1:06:22.061 --> 1:06:23.938
This is fine.

1:06:26.273 --> 1:06:28.025
Thank you so much

1:06:28.901 --> 1:06:31.278
for helping me
give birth to a healthy baby.

1:06:32.196 --> 1:06:33.906
I should be the one to thank you

1:06:34.907 --> 1:06:37.410
for having trust in me.

1:06:39.245 --> 1:06:42.289
Dr. Yoon, would you like to hold our baby?

1:06:43.958 --> 1:06:44.959
Can I?

1:06:45.918 --> 1:06:48.254
But I've never held a baby before.

1:06:48.337 --> 1:06:50.172
Yes, you have.

1:06:50.256 --> 1:06:52.008
You delivered the baby.

1:06:54.260 --> 1:06:55.094
You're right.

1:06:55.761 --> 1:06:58.305
Here. Come on.

1:07:12.987 --> 1:07:13.863
Excuse me.

1:07:14.572 --> 1:07:16.866
May I come inside?

1:07:19.618 --> 1:07:20.494
Sure.

1:07:26.917 --> 1:07:29.045
Chief Hong, isn't the baby beautiful?

1:07:31.005 --> 1:07:33.007
Even this one takes after Geum-cheol.

1:07:33.924 --> 1:07:36.385
Yun-gyeong, your genes must be too weak.

1:07:36.469 --> 1:07:40.347
Tell me about it. I was the one
who gave birth. It's so unfair.

1:07:41.307 --> 1:07:43.809
You've done so well. Congratulations.

1:07:45.227 --> 1:07:47.104
Now you're parents of two children.

1:07:49.273 --> 1:07:50.274
Du-sik.

1:07:52.443 --> 1:07:53.486
Thanks.

1:07:54.945 --> 1:07:57.239
Goodness.

1:08:02.912 --> 1:08:04.955
Isn't the baby so tiny and cute?

1:08:05.039 --> 1:08:06.040
Yes.

1:08:07.124 --> 1:08:08.626
Hold the baby yourself.

1:08:08.709 --> 1:08:11.337
Gosh, no. It's okay.

1:08:11.420 --> 1:08:13.798
-She's right. You should.
-It's okay.

1:08:16.050 --> 1:08:17.134
-Careful.
-Okay.

1:08:25.976 --> 1:08:26.977
Hi.

1:08:28.187 --> 1:08:30.189
Welcome to the world.

1:08:56.257 --> 1:08:57.758
It must've been exhausting.

1:08:57.842 --> 1:08:59.093
It was.

1:09:00.094 --> 1:09:01.804
My entire body feels drained.

1:09:06.267 --> 1:09:07.977
That's because it's all over now.

1:09:09.103 --> 1:09:10.146
Well done.

1:09:10.938 --> 1:09:12.982
I'm proud of you. Really.

1:09:15.151 --> 1:09:16.944
I'm also proud of myself.

1:09:17.027 --> 1:09:19.321
Where did you get the courage to do that?

1:09:19.989 --> 1:09:21.574
At that moment,

1:09:22.283 --> 1:09:26.328
all I could think about
was saving Yun-gyeong and her baby.

1:09:26.912 --> 1:09:29.623
-I'm afraid I'll have to retire now.
-What?

1:09:29.707 --> 1:09:32.751
Whenever something urgent pops up
in Gongjin,

1:09:32.835 --> 1:09:35.337
people will be looking for you, not me.

1:09:36.672 --> 1:09:37.798
Oh, please.

1:09:39.550 --> 1:09:40.593
I'm so sleepy.

1:09:40.676 --> 1:09:41.677
Then sleep.

1:09:42.595 --> 1:09:45.931
But where? My bedroom's taken.

1:09:46.599 --> 1:09:47.558
Let's go to my place.

1:09:48.225 --> 1:09:49.226
Okay.

1:09:51.812 --> 1:09:53.772
Let me just get changed.

1:09:53.856 --> 1:09:55.983
-Okay. What if she wakes up?
-I'll be quiet.

1:10:00.070 --> 1:10:01.363
Goodness.

1:10:01.447 --> 1:10:02.615
Watch your step.

1:10:04.241 --> 1:10:05.659
Gosh.

1:10:05.743 --> 1:10:07.786
Here. Give me that.

1:10:07.870 --> 1:10:08.871
Okay.

1:10:16.253 --> 1:10:17.171
Get some sleep.

1:10:17.963 --> 1:10:19.089
What about you?

1:10:19.965 --> 1:10:21.675
You didn't sleep a wink either.

1:10:22.259 --> 1:10:23.510
I can sleep on the sofa.

1:10:23.594 --> 1:10:25.971
No, come sleep next to me.

1:10:27.890 --> 1:10:30.059
Sleep by my side. Come on.

1:10:31.435 --> 1:10:32.436
Okay.

1:10:36.815 --> 1:10:38.734
You were amazing today.

1:10:39.401 --> 1:10:40.402
I know.

1:10:42.613 --> 1:10:44.281
But it felt strange.

1:10:45.616 --> 1:10:46.617
What did?

1:10:47.117 --> 1:10:49.703
I never thought of myself as a kid lover.

1:10:51.288 --> 1:10:53.582
But when I held the baby in my arms,

1:10:54.500 --> 1:10:56.043
I got emotional.

1:10:59.088 --> 1:11:03.550
It was tiny, warm, and soft.

1:11:05.094 --> 1:11:09.223
It's amazing that little baby
brought so much happiness to us all.

1:11:09.807 --> 1:11:14.770
I'm sure you brought happiness
to many as well when you were born.

1:11:15.479 --> 1:11:16.480
You too.

1:11:19.108 --> 1:11:21.902
Then this thought crossed my mind.

1:11:23.654 --> 1:11:27.074
"My parents gave their all
to have me in this world,

1:11:27.574 --> 1:11:29.451
so I must do my best to find happiness."

1:11:34.248 --> 1:11:35.249
Chief Hong.

1:11:36.667 --> 1:11:38.752
-Yes?
-In the future…

1:11:39.545 --> 1:11:41.046
Much later in the future…

1:11:42.214 --> 1:11:44.258
You know how everyone thinks about it.

1:11:45.801 --> 1:11:48.304
When you're ready to have kids,

1:11:48.387 --> 1:11:51.307
how many kids do you want?

1:11:51.390 --> 1:11:54.727
How you'd want a son
or a daughter for your first child?

1:11:56.061 --> 1:11:58.272
Have you ever thought of that?

1:12:02.735 --> 1:12:06.322
I'm not sure. I've never really…

1:12:08.282 --> 1:12:09.950
thought of that before.

1:12:47.196 --> 1:12:50.199
<i>WHAT MEN LIVE BY</i> BY LEO TOLSTOY

1:13:06.548 --> 1:13:08.801
Why aren't you sleeping?

1:13:08.884 --> 1:13:09.718
Well…

1:13:15.224 --> 1:13:17.101
Why are you going through my books?

1:13:22.106 --> 1:13:22.940
I'm sorry.

1:13:23.941 --> 1:13:26.485
No, I'm sorry. I overreacted.

1:13:27.611 --> 1:13:30.489
Who are those people in the photo?

1:13:32.074 --> 1:13:34.368
They're just some people I know.

1:13:38.872 --> 1:13:40.416
Let's go inside.

1:13:40.499 --> 1:13:42.126
Will you keep doing that?

1:13:43.210 --> 1:13:44.086
Do what?

1:13:44.169 --> 1:13:47.381
"Just some people I know."
"Just a desk job."

1:13:49.550 --> 1:13:53.095
Will you continue giving vague answers?

1:13:57.391 --> 1:13:59.226
I've shown you everything.

1:14:00.310 --> 1:14:03.480
My dad, my stepmom…

1:14:04.356 --> 1:14:06.483
even my stupidly drunk self.

1:14:08.819 --> 1:14:11.613
I don't mind showing my true self to you.

1:14:12.489 --> 1:14:13.907
Do you not feel the same way?

1:14:24.877 --> 1:14:26.086
You see,

1:14:27.504 --> 1:14:29.756
I was so jealous of Yun-gyeong today.

1:14:30.591 --> 1:14:33.093
For having someone
who vowed to be by her side

1:14:34.094 --> 1:14:36.513
through thick and thin.

1:14:40.309 --> 1:14:43.562
You kept your promise
about my bucket list wishes.

1:14:44.480 --> 1:14:46.648
You agreed to do all sorts of things.

1:14:47.941 --> 1:14:51.111
But why won't you do
the most important one?

1:14:53.363 --> 1:14:55.574
Why won't you open up to me
about yourself?

1:15:03.707 --> 1:15:05.792
Why is it so difficult for you?

1:15:09.338 --> 1:15:10.547
You see,

1:15:12.007 --> 1:15:13.800
I really like you.

1:15:16.303 --> 1:15:17.763
So I want to know…

1:15:19.681 --> 1:15:22.017
what kind of life you've lived

1:15:23.227 --> 1:15:25.145
and what's on your mind.

1:15:34.780 --> 1:15:38.200
I've been dreaming of the day

1:15:39.159 --> 1:15:41.161
you and I become family.

1:15:55.509 --> 1:15:57.135
Say something. Anything.

1:16:06.144 --> 1:16:07.145
I'm sorry.

1:16:12.943 --> 1:16:15.362
Why are you turning into someone else?

1:16:18.073 --> 1:16:19.616
Why are you drifting away?

1:16:23.245 --> 1:16:24.997
Why are you becoming a stranger?

1:16:30.711 --> 1:16:32.963
I don't know who you are anymore.

1:16:35.048 --> 1:16:36.425
I don't understand you.

1:16:40.345 --> 1:16:41.346
Me neither.

1:16:49.396 --> 1:16:50.814
I don't know either.

1:17:14.838 --> 1:17:17.507
Bo-ra, have some pork rinds.

1:17:18.800 --> 1:17:20.510
I-jun, your meat is on this side.

1:17:20.594 --> 1:17:21.845
What about the bean powder?

1:17:21.928 --> 1:17:25.766
It's right here.
You sure know how to eat your pork rinds.

1:17:27.184 --> 1:17:28.310
Eat up.

1:17:28.393 --> 1:17:29.394
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1:17:29.478 --> 1:17:30.354
My pleasure.

1:17:36.360 --> 1:17:38.070
Do you like Seumseum as well?

1:17:38.153 --> 1:17:40.739
Of course. I love all kinds of animals.

1:17:40.822 --> 1:17:43.033
Hedgehogs, dogs, cats…

1:17:43.533 --> 1:17:46.370
Then why did you refuse
to take care of it back then?

1:17:47.371 --> 1:17:52.250
Bo-ra, it's rude to bring up
the past like that.

1:17:52.334 --> 1:17:54.169
I-jun, do you want to die?

1:17:54.252 --> 1:17:56.046
Violence is bad.

1:17:56.755 --> 1:17:58.715
You should stop right now.

1:17:59.883 --> 1:18:00.884
I think

1:18:01.677 --> 1:18:03.887
I'm still afraid…

1:18:06.556 --> 1:18:07.933
of saying goodbye.

1:18:47.055 --> 1:18:48.181
What's the matter?

1:18:48.265 --> 1:18:52.310
<i>Do you know why he quit his job
and came back to Gongjin?</i>

1:18:52.394 --> 1:18:54.855
<i>What may be easy for one person</i>

1:18:54.938 --> 1:18:57.858
<i>can be something difficult for another.</i>

1:18:57.941 --> 1:19:00.736
<i>I think we need to have some time apart.</i>

1:19:00.819 --> 1:19:03.488
<i>Just be honest.
Show her what kind of person you are.</i>

1:19:03.572 --> 1:19:05.741
<i>And you let her decide
how she feels about it.</i>

1:19:05.824 --> 1:19:10.245
<i>Du-sik. Eat a lot of good food,
and be happy.</i>

1:19:10.996 --> 1:19:12.414
My grandfather…

1:19:12.497 --> 1:19:14.583
<i>I hate it when things are vague.</i>

1:19:14.666 --> 1:19:17.711
Things that are ambiguous
don't sit well with me.

1:19:17.794 --> 1:19:19.087
So what I want to say is…

1:19:19.171 --> 1:19:20.255
Hye-jin.

1:19:21.047 --> 1:19:26.052
