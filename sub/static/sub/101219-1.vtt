'No pieces of the body
have been found,

00:19.275 --> 00:23.280
'and the authorities say,
"Sea monsters aren't real."'

00:25.716 --> 00:29.420
Ahoy! And salutations!

00:29.452 --> 00:32.890
My name is Captain Seafield.

00:32.923 --> 00:36.294
'The authorities say,
"Sea monsters aren't real.

00:36.326 --> 00:39.729
'"Or for that matter,
lake monsters."'

00:39.762 --> 00:41.498
One month ago,

00:41.531 --> 00:44.534
me and a fellow
ship captain of mine

00:44.567 --> 00:46.903
ventured out
on a morning fishing trip

00:46.936 --> 00:50.440
upon the great tides
of Lake Michigan.

00:50.473 --> 00:54.644
As we cast our lines,
suddenly from out of nowhere,

00:54.677 --> 00:58.949
a Hellish sea monster crept up
from the shallow depths,

00:58.982 --> 01:01.218
boarded our vessel,

01:01.252 --> 01:04.322
and killed my associate.

01:04.355 --> 01:06.624
It then dragged him underwater

01:06.656 --> 01:09.560
and vanished
into the murky abyss.

01:12.629 --> 01:15.865
The victim here was my father.

01:15.899 --> 01:18.868
'The authorities say,
"Sea monsters aren't real.

01:18.902 --> 01:21.605
'"Or for that matter,
lake monsters."'

01:21.638 --> 01:25.242
And so, I have hired
a group of specialists

01:25.275 --> 01:28.712
to help me locate the beast
and murder it.

01:40.891 --> 01:43.995
'Sean Shaughnessy,
weapons expert.

01:49.066 --> 01:51.534
'Nedge Pepsi, sonar individual.'

02:00.843 --> 02:02.479
'And Dick Flynn,

02:02.513 --> 02:05.049
'former officer at the Nautical
Athletes Adventure Yunit.

02:05.081 --> 02:08.618
'Sometimes referred to
as the "N.A.V.Y."'

02:08.651 --> 02:10.487
And there it is!

02:11.655 --> 02:13.925
The team of the century!

02:19.629 --> 02:22.599
- Sean Shaughnessy.
- How big is this monster?

02:22.633 --> 02:24.435
Excellent question.

02:24.467 --> 02:26.304
This is a lion.

02:27.570 --> 02:29.806
This is a tiger.

02:31.008 --> 02:32.743
It's as big as a lion.

02:38.514 --> 02:40.484
What does it look like?

02:47.957 --> 02:49.826
Monstrous.

02:49.860 --> 02:51.462
Right?

02:51.495 --> 02:52.997
Do we have a boat?

02:53.030 --> 02:55.032
It's pronounced "pontoon".

02:55.064 --> 02:56.901
But we shan't be needing it
for anything other

02:56.933 --> 02:58.401
than general seafaring

02:58.435 --> 02:59.870
as our hunt will be boat-less,

02:59.902 --> 03:02.639
for, you see,
our monster resides...

03:04.707 --> 03:06.343
- ...here.
- Is that...?

03:06.377 --> 03:08.379
- Lake Michigan.
- We know it's Lake Michigan.

03:08.412 --> 03:09.813
It's the name of the movie.

03:13.717 --> 03:16.921
Yes, but more precisely
it lives here,

03:16.954 --> 03:18.923
off the shore
of my lighthouse island.

03:18.955 --> 03:20.790
I tell you, we weren't
one fathom in the water

03:20.824 --> 03:22.626
when the beast slew my father.

03:22.658 --> 03:24.894
Wait, I thought you said
he was thrown overboard

03:24.927 --> 03:26.496
on a fishing trip.

03:28.765 --> 03:30.700
Well, he was, by the beast.

03:30.734 --> 03:33.737
And that is precisely
why we must find and kill

03:33.770 --> 03:35.405
the Lake Michigan Monster!

03:35.438 --> 03:38.975
Right. But you said you weren't
one fathom out on the lake

03:39.008 --> 03:40.110
before the monster struck?

03:40.144 --> 03:42.445
- Well, we weren't.
- One fathom?

03:42.479 --> 03:45.649
You were one fathom off the
shore for a fishing trip?

03:45.681 --> 03:48.452
- Yes!
- You know how long a fathom is?

03:59.430 --> 04:01.064
It's six feet.

04:02.132 --> 04:04.001
Bah!

04:04.033 --> 04:06.870
F.A.T.H.O.M.:
Facultative Aquatic Taffrail

04:06.903 --> 04:09.038
Haliographic
Opinion Measurement.

04:09.072 --> 04:10.775
I'm not sure that's right.

04:10.807 --> 04:14.544
What did you take the boat out
and instantaneously run aground?

04:14.578 --> 04:17.180
- Then cast your fishing lines?
- What else is in that podium?

04:17.213 --> 04:19.149
Well, maybe that's precisely
what happened!

04:19.182 --> 04:22.653
Now why the hell is that
so hard to grasp? Oh, God...

04:22.685 --> 04:25.656
Hey, what's going on here?
Seafield!

04:25.689 --> 04:28.759
For the love of God,
stop using my classroom!

04:28.791 --> 04:30.727
Expelled means expelled!

05:08.966 --> 05:12.002
Lake Michigan...
this is where it all happens.

05:24.848 --> 05:27.685
Here's the deal.

05:27.718 --> 05:29.687
This is the beach.
There's the water.

05:29.720 --> 05:31.021
Here we are right now.

05:31.053 --> 05:33.056
Nedge has set up the sonar
station over there.

05:33.089 --> 05:35.892
When Nedge flips the switch,
Sean Shaughnessy will give Dick

05:35.925 --> 05:37.694
his monster-killing weapon
of choice.

05:37.728 --> 05:40.898
Then, Dick, you're going to walk
ten paces to the kayak, get in,

05:40.930 --> 05:44.000
row yourself out to sea,
dive in, and begin your search.

05:44.033 --> 05:46.036
Back on land, Sean Shaughnessy
will be lookout,

05:46.069 --> 05:49.607
while Nedge and I watch for
any blips on the Sonar 2000.

05:49.639 --> 05:53.843
It shall be known as:
Operation Annihilation!

06:31.213 --> 06:35.052
One. Two. Three.

06:35.084 --> 06:38.555
Four. Five. Six.

06:38.588 --> 06:40.891
Seven. Eight...

06:46.762 --> 06:48.132
Nine.

06:49.031 --> 06:50.600
Uh, ten!

07:01.877 --> 07:02.979
He's in.

07:27.370 --> 07:30.040
Has he found anything?

07:33.276 --> 07:35.045
Negative.

07:40.117 --> 07:41.919
Go give him a hand,
Sean Shaughnessy.

07:41.951 --> 07:43.153
Right.

07:48.324 --> 07:50.226
That's my weapons expert.

08:06.742 --> 08:10.647
So, Seafield, what's it like
being a ship captain?

08:14.850 --> 08:16.353
- Seafield.
- What?

08:16.386 --> 08:18.689
How do you like being
a ship captain?

08:18.721 --> 08:20.390
I'm not a ship captain.

08:20.423 --> 08:22.825
What? I thought that was
kind of your thing.

08:25.696 --> 08:28.399
- I hope Dick's okay.
- Did you get it?

08:28.432 --> 08:30.201
Nope. False alarm.

08:40.342 --> 08:42.312
You almost shot me!

08:44.947 --> 08:46.683
There's nothing down there,
Seafield.

08:46.716 --> 08:48.885
Damn. Well, you all tried
your best.

08:48.918 --> 08:50.954
Let's regroup at my place
and drink bourbon.

08:55.057 --> 08:57.093
Nedge, go wake up
Sean Shaughnessy.

09:39.068 --> 09:41.404
You know, I really thought
that plan would work.

09:41.437 --> 09:44.240
Oh, well, a marginal setback.

09:44.274 --> 09:45.908
What's our next plan of attack?

09:45.942 --> 09:48.312
Ha-ha! Attack.

09:48.345 --> 09:51.281
Spoken like a true
weapons expert.

09:51.313 --> 09:53.382
That's why I got you,
Sean Shaughnessy.

09:53.416 --> 09:56.286
Violence is always on your mind.

09:56.318 --> 09:58.288
Much like that
of the creature's.

09:58.321 --> 10:02.893
With a gun or a knife
we must end this monster's life.

10:08.831 --> 10:10.867
So what's our next plan
of attack?

10:10.900 --> 10:14.170
- Who wants fish sticks?
- Oh, here we go!

10:14.203 --> 10:15.872
Martha, you spoil us!

10:15.905 --> 10:18.174
Now, now, even
the Team of the Century

10:18.207 --> 10:19.976
has to eat once in a while.

10:20.009 --> 10:22.011
- Thank you.
- She's right, you know.

10:22.044 --> 10:26.415
Food gives us energy, and energy
is what, Sean Shaughnessy?

10:26.448 --> 10:28.317
Uh, energy is...

10:28.350 --> 10:31.421
- A good thing!
- Energy is a good thing, idiot.

10:31.453 --> 10:33.356
Martha, did you happen
to bring the ketchup?

10:33.389 --> 10:36.156
Did I happen to bring ketchup?

10:36.158 --> 10:38.795
Martha! She knows me too well.

10:38.828 --> 10:42.832
Okay, now you all enjoy. Plates
and napkins are here in the bar.

10:42.865 --> 10:44.433
Thank you, thank you.

10:44.466 --> 10:46.336
And don't forget, tomorrow
you've got that field trip.

10:46.369 --> 10:49.907
- Alright. Alright, Martha.
- Thank you.

10:49.940 --> 10:51.108
Martha.

10:51.140 --> 10:52.876
My wife.

10:54.110 --> 10:56.046
Ah, very nice.

10:56.078 --> 10:59.081
- Nedge?
- Oh, yeah?

10:59.115 --> 11:00.551
- Come on.
- What?

11:00.583 --> 11:02.452
Let's hear it.

11:03.854 --> 11:05.422
- Ah...
- Uh...

11:05.455 --> 11:07.424
Oh! Uh...

11:07.456 --> 11:10.494
- To the Team of the Century!
- Ah, very nice.

11:13.529 --> 11:15.966
Not bad.

11:15.999 --> 11:17.267
- Oh!
- Urgh!

11:17.299 --> 11:19.302
Shit, that's bad!

11:19.336 --> 11:22.438
- Urgh! No one else try that!
- No one would do that.

11:22.471 --> 11:24.240
Urgh! I need ketchup!

11:24.274 --> 11:27.410
So, here's the new deal.

11:27.443 --> 11:29.545
This is the beach again.
There's the water again.

11:29.578 --> 11:31.180
Here we are right now again.

11:31.214 --> 11:33.317
Nedge has set up the sonar
station over there again.

11:33.350 --> 11:34.951
When Nedge flips
the switch again,

11:34.985 --> 11:36.186
Sean Shaughnessy will give Dick

11:36.219 --> 11:37.888
his monster-killing weapon
of choice again.

11:37.921 --> 11:40.524
Then, you'll walk ten paces
to the kayak, get in again,

11:40.557 --> 11:42.491
row yourself out to the sea
again, dive in again,

11:42.524 --> 11:44.093
and begin your search again.

11:44.126 --> 11:45.361
Back on land, Sean Shaughnessy
will be lookout again,

11:45.394 --> 11:48.598
while Nedge and I watch for any
blips on the Sonar 2000 again.

11:48.631 --> 11:54.237
Except this time, it shall be
known as: Operation Nauty Lady.

11:57.039 --> 11:59.342
- Why, though?
- Why what?

11:59.375 --> 12:02.144
I mean, I like the name
and everything,

12:02.177 --> 12:04.047
I think it's really clever.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.617
But what does it have to do
with anything?

12:13.023 --> 12:15.091
Whoa, hey!
Where are my clothes?

12:17.427 --> 12:20.096
You must be naked
for the nauty lady!

12:20.129 --> 12:21.631
What the hell does that mean?

12:21.664 --> 12:24.300
Last night I finished my fish
sticks and I got to thinking.

12:24.333 --> 12:26.636
What if this monster is a lady?

12:26.669 --> 12:29.005
Well, then, naturally
she'd be attracted

12:29.038 --> 12:30.673
to a naked swimming man.

12:30.706 --> 12:32.942
- Naturally.
- I didn't sign up for this!

12:32.975 --> 12:36.279
- Where are my clothes?
- Oh, and by the way...

12:36.312 --> 12:40.116
...I forgot to hand out these
last night.

12:40.149 --> 12:43.319
Your payment
for all your hard work.

12:43.352 --> 12:45.388
Nedge Pepsi.

12:45.422 --> 12:47.691
Sean Shaughnessy.

12:47.724 --> 12:50.927
And... Mr. Dick Flynn.

13:00.470 --> 13:02.205
You know what, Seafield?

13:02.238 --> 13:04.374
I actually think
this is a really good plan.

13:04.407 --> 13:06.475
- Right?
- The monster will see me naked.

13:06.509 --> 13:08.478
- It'll wanna get on top of me!
- I think so, too.

13:08.510 --> 13:10.447
That's when I'll stab it
in its neck.

13:10.480 --> 13:11.981
That's the spirit, Dick!

13:12.014 --> 13:15.119
Now, everyone in position!

13:36.172 --> 13:38.108
Let's not shoot at me
this time.

13:38.140 --> 13:40.243
I take my orders
from the Captain.

13:43.212 --> 13:45.581
Now I know why
they call him Dick.

13:45.615 --> 13:47.317
Why?

13:47.350 --> 13:50.153
Because... he has a penis.

13:53.288 --> 13:54.991
Seven.

13:55.024 --> 13:56.326
Eight.

14:04.433 --> 14:07.403
Nine. Ten.

14:10.340 --> 14:12.609
- So brave.
- Mm-hmm...

14:19.581 --> 14:20.650
He's in.

14:27.724 --> 14:30.627
- Would you date him?
- Uh...

14:30.659 --> 14:33.462
I don't really date teammates.

14:33.495 --> 14:35.499
I don't date at all
because I'm a married man.

14:35.532 --> 14:37.234
It's one of those things
you can't be doing

14:37.267 --> 14:38.802
once you're married.

14:38.835 --> 14:40.704
Of course, I can still remember
me and Martha's first date...

14:40.736 --> 14:45.074
- Keep an eye on the sonar.
- Haunted beer garden.

14:57.352 --> 14:58.521
I got something!

14:58.554 --> 15:02.025
As do we, old chap!
Good job, Nedge!

15:10.600 --> 15:12.369
Wow, this thing's actually
pretty big.

15:12.402 --> 15:14.237
Monster's aren't small, Nedge.

15:14.269 --> 15:15.538
Except for centipedes.

15:15.572 --> 15:17.807
Except for centipedes.
This is true.

15:17.841 --> 15:20.509
Although small, they are
quite monstrous, nevertheless.

15:20.543 --> 15:22.711
- All those legs.
- All those legs are right.

15:22.745 --> 15:25.048
It's encircling Dick!

15:27.182 --> 15:29.452
Sean Shaughnessy,
prepare to lock and load!

15:29.485 --> 15:30.553
Right!

15:32.355 --> 15:34.124
Alright, Sean Shaughnessy,
get in there and...

15:37.226 --> 15:39.262
Not seeing anything, Seafield.

15:54.510 --> 15:56.112
Dick!

15:58.914 --> 16:00.483
Dick!

16:20.503 --> 16:22.605
Alright, Sean Shaughnessy,
get in there!

16:22.639 --> 16:25.442
Kill the monster! Kill it!

16:25.475 --> 16:27.478
Damn it, Sean Shaughnessy!

16:28.443 --> 16:30.146
Alright, Nedge, you're up!

16:30.179 --> 16:32.448
I don't know, I'm really
more of a sonar individual.

16:46.962 --> 16:51.500
Dick! Dick! Thank Poseidon
you're alright. He lives!

16:51.533 --> 16:53.302
- Where are my clothes?
- Nedge?

16:53.336 --> 16:55.305
So, did you kill it?

16:55.337 --> 16:57.307
Did I kill it? No!

16:57.340 --> 16:58.875
Then how are you possibly
still alive?

16:58.908 --> 17:01.411
I dunno. One minute
he had me all wrapped up,

17:01.443 --> 17:03.312
then the next he was gone.

17:03.346 --> 17:04.681
Dear God!

17:04.713 --> 17:08.384
- Did you get a good look at it?
- No. Felt slimy.

17:08.416 --> 17:11.554
- You owe me a family heirloom.
- Yes, I do.

17:11.587 --> 17:13.423
I'll give you the money.

17:13.454 --> 17:15.358
Thank you, Seafield.

17:18.627 --> 17:20.462
Hey, guys, sorry!

17:20.496 --> 17:22.732
Sorry, my friend's terrible
at volleyball.

17:22.765 --> 17:25.402
Get out of here, Girlie!

17:32.375 --> 17:34.310
I didn't believe him.

17:34.344 --> 17:35.946
None of us did.

17:35.979 --> 17:39.548
Hmm...
A sea monster? Ridiculous.

17:39.582 --> 17:42.853
But he was right. That
eccentric bastard was right.

17:49.892 --> 17:53.663
- Wow.
- That big? Wow.

17:55.731 --> 17:59.469
So this huge monster
has you in its grasp

17:59.501 --> 18:00.803
and then it just lets you go.

18:00.836 --> 18:03.640
- Not a scratch.
- I wonder why.

18:03.673 --> 18:05.808
- Terrifying nevertheless.
- Ah...

18:08.411 --> 18:11.381
By the way, Seafield,
not a real sea captain.

18:11.413 --> 18:13.516
- Wait, seriously?
- No, I am not!

18:13.548 --> 18:15.618
There, happy, Nedge?
I'm docking your pay.

18:15.652 --> 18:17.653
- Where did you come from?
- Phoenix.

18:17.686 --> 18:19.521
Uh... no, just now.

18:19.555 --> 18:21.490
Trapdoor. It's my house, Nedge.

18:21.523 --> 18:23.359
This is some really
good bourbon.

18:23.393 --> 18:26.496
Isn't it? Ashcroft brought me
back a barrel from Glasgow.

18:26.528 --> 18:28.498
- Scotland?
- Kentucky.

18:28.530 --> 18:30.666
It's bourbon, after all.

18:30.700 --> 18:35.872
- Not... a moor.
- Who's Ashcroft?

18:35.904 --> 18:38.241
I be Ashcroft!

18:39.709 --> 18:42.379
I know. Tell them.

18:42.412 --> 18:44.980
I be Ashcroft!

18:45.013 --> 18:47.516
So, you're searching
for the old man, eh?

18:47.549 --> 18:50.452
That's right, and this is
my band of rowdy cutthroats,

18:50.486 --> 18:52.990
Dick, Nedge,
and Sean Shaughnessy.

18:57.727 --> 19:00.764
Well, I suppose
you could've done worse.

19:02.597 --> 19:04.500
You have a fine taste
in whiskey, sir!

19:04.534 --> 19:05.969
It's ruined me life!

19:06.001 --> 19:09.306
- What are we painting here?
- It's a freaking landscape.

19:11.441 --> 19:14.611
Oh, yeah. I can see it.

19:14.644 --> 19:17.846
So, how have you been
hunting this monster?

19:17.880 --> 19:19.616
Come aboard!

19:20.048 --> 19:21.651
Blades.

19:21.683 --> 19:22.885
Guns.

19:22.919 --> 19:24.854
- Sonar 2000.
- Sonar?

19:24.886 --> 19:26.855
Too good for the old ways, eh?

19:26.888 --> 19:29.391
Ashcroft, you know
I don't have intuition.

19:29.424 --> 19:30.559
He knows that.

19:30.593 --> 19:31.928
You don't use sonar
of any kind?

19:31.961 --> 19:34.698
Don't even know what it is,
to tell you the truth.

19:34.730 --> 19:38.301
Wait. You don't use...
How old are you?

19:43.472 --> 19:44.774
Thirty.

19:47.076 --> 19:52.615
After I graduated
high school in 2005,

19:52.647 --> 19:55.651
I went into the longshoreman
business to join my father.

19:55.684 --> 20:01.890
On my first day out, he said,
"Son! Sonar is for pussies!"

20:01.923 --> 20:04.394
- And that was the end of it.
- He never said that.

20:04.426 --> 20:07.396
- That was the end of it!
- He never said that.

20:07.430 --> 20:10.400
Okay, fine. He never said that.

20:10.432 --> 20:12.067
Anyways, the point is,

20:12.101 --> 20:13.870
if you're going to catch
that monster,

20:13.903 --> 20:15.404
you're going to have
to go at night.

20:15.438 --> 20:18.575
- Why at night?
- Monsters come out at night!

20:18.607 --> 20:21.778
- Ah, yes.
- And you'll need one of these!

20:21.810 --> 20:23.612
Hook your bait with this hook

20:23.645 --> 20:26.682
and your monster
is as good as hooked.

20:26.715 --> 20:28.150
I know I'm hooked.

20:28.183 --> 20:29.918
- Me, too.
- Me, three.

20:29.951 --> 20:31.654
Gimme that!

21:02.617 --> 21:08.758
♪ And that's when I said
goodbye... ♪

21:08.790 --> 21:11.126
- Yow!
- Oh, mercy!

21:11.160 --> 21:13.430
- Yow!
- Wonderful!

21:15.565 --> 21:17.167
- Whoo-hoo!
- Oh, wow.

21:17.200 --> 21:19.635
Absolutely terrific.

21:19.669 --> 21:23.773
- Dick, you're a real talent.
- Ah... I know.

21:23.806 --> 21:25.642
- Are you in a band?
- Use to be.

21:25.674 --> 21:27.609
Was the leader
of the Navy concert band.

21:27.643 --> 21:29.045
Like the director?

21:29.077 --> 21:32.080
The commanding officer.
So, yeah, the music director.

21:32.114 --> 21:34.550
Youngest in history, in fact.

21:34.584 --> 21:37.887
That's quite impressive, Dick.
I had no idea.

21:37.920 --> 21:41.557
It was a lot of fun. Traveling
the world, doing a lot of shows.

21:41.590 --> 21:44.193
Did some NFL games,
saw the Pyramids in Egypt.

21:44.227 --> 21:46.763
- That's awesome.
- Yeah.

21:46.796 --> 21:49.132
- What made you stop?
- Oh, I was discharged.

21:50.232 --> 21:51.967
Oh... okay.

21:53.736 --> 21:55.572
Yeah...

21:57.606 --> 21:59.675
Honorably, no doubt.

22:02.612 --> 22:03.846
Uh...

22:05.047 --> 22:07.683
No, not honorably.

22:07.717 --> 22:13.223
You see, I had lots of...
sexual misconduct

22:13.256 --> 22:17.660
with the woodwind
and percussion sections.

22:17.692 --> 22:19.261
I also shot the timpani player

22:19.295 --> 22:22.532
in a very strange
sequence of events.

22:29.305 --> 22:31.842
- So, dishonorable.
- Look, guy's a character.

22:54.063 --> 22:56.500
Battle stations!

23:00.269 --> 23:02.572
Wait for it...

23:04.205 --> 23:05.808
Now!

23:08.911 --> 23:11.080
- 1, 2, 3!
- Heave!

23:11.113 --> 23:13.950
- 1, 2, 3!
- Heave!

23:13.982 --> 23:16.318
- 1, 2, 3!
- Heave!

23:16.352 --> 23:18.086
Here it comes!

23:18.119 --> 23:20.923
Sean Shaughnessy!

23:20.957 --> 23:23.660
Sean Shaughnessy!

23:23.692 --> 23:26.195
Your time is up, monster!

23:36.204 --> 23:37.773
What...?

23:40.209 --> 23:41.778
Huh...

23:44.313 --> 23:45.882
Hmm...

23:47.782 --> 23:49.752
It's blank.

23:52.288 --> 23:54.924
Oh. Yes, of course.

24:02.365 --> 24:05.335
"Be seeing you...

24:08.971 --> 24:12.875
"...in your... dreams."

25:39.428 --> 25:41.264
Sean Shaughnessy!

25:47.368 --> 25:49.271
Does he not have
his eyebrow make-up on?

25:49.305 --> 25:51.207
Sean Shaughnessy!

25:55.144 --> 25:57.012
- I got it!
- Is that an egg?

25:57.046 --> 25:58.715
I got the egg!

26:02.183 --> 26:05.754
Sean Shaughnessy!
I got it! I got it!

26:05.788 --> 26:08.223
I got the egg! Hee-hee!

26:11.961 --> 26:14.997
Now! Shoot it, Sean Shaughnessy!
Shoot the egg!

26:15.029 --> 26:16.766
Is that the monster's egg?

26:16.798 --> 26:19.335
Yes. I saw some stuff
while I was sleeping.

26:19.367 --> 26:20.836
- Like a dream.
- That's the one.

26:20.869 --> 26:23.405
Where's your eyebrow make-up?

26:23.439 --> 26:25.374
I don't know
what you're talking about!

26:27.542 --> 26:29.244
Oh, no, you don't!

26:31.247 --> 26:33.182
Kill it! Kill it,
Sean Shaughnessy!

26:33.214 --> 26:36.118
Just like its mama
killed my daddy!

27:06.848 --> 27:08.283
Jesus!

27:17.026 --> 27:20.897
Chug, chug, chug, chug...

27:23.031 --> 27:24.533
Beer!

27:26.902 --> 27:28.538
Hurray!

27:28.570 --> 27:30.405
But did we have
to kill its baby?

27:30.439 --> 27:32.008
Blood for blood,
Nedge.

27:32.040 --> 27:33.809
It kills my father,
we shoot its egg.

27:33.843 --> 27:36.045
- Remind you of anything?
- Hmm... no.

27:36.077 --> 27:37.480
- Iwo Jima.
- How?

27:37.512 --> 27:39.247
Ooh, the candy shop!

27:39.280 --> 27:42.585
- So... Nedge.
- Yes?

27:42.617 --> 27:47.189
- What is your full name?
- Nedge Pepsi.

27:47.222 --> 27:51.493
No. No, I mean like
what is Nedge short for?

27:53.162 --> 27:55.064
Nedgecraft.

27:55.096 --> 27:57.465
"Nedgecraft"?

27:57.499 --> 27:59.935
- It's Polish.
- No, it's not.

27:59.969 --> 28:03.471
Your full name is
"Nedgecraft Pepsi"?

28:03.505 --> 28:05.241
Junior.

28:05.273 --> 28:08.176
Damn candy store is closed!
Bunch of pedophiles!

28:08.210 --> 28:10.846
Whoa! Hey, uh...
So what's our next plan, boss?

28:10.880 --> 28:13.082
Ah! The man knows a question
but not the answer.

28:13.115 --> 28:15.050
That's why I asked.

28:28.463 --> 28:31.333
Beach, water,
sonar station.

28:31.366 --> 28:33.101
Dick will carry
the egg carcass...

28:33.134 --> 28:34.336
Fully clothed.

28:34.369 --> 28:35.904
Fine.
But not your clothes.

28:35.938 --> 28:37.139
Everyone switch clothes.

28:37.172 --> 28:39.141
In order to draw
the sea hag out,

28:39.173 --> 28:41.911
Dick will toss the eggshells
one fathom into the sea.

28:41.943 --> 28:43.578
The scent will be intoxicating.

28:43.612 --> 28:46.182
The monster maiden
won't be able to resist.

28:46.214 --> 28:49.217
- She must be worried sick.
- Nedge let's hear it.

28:49.250 --> 28:50.485
Hear what?

28:50.519 --> 28:52.121
The name of the operation,
of course.

28:52.153 --> 28:54.289
Your last one was so clever.

28:54.323 --> 28:57.259
How about
Operation Eggsecution?

28:57.292 --> 28:58.660
Ah!

28:58.693 --> 29:00.528
No, no, wait, that's terrible.
But listen to this...

29:00.561 --> 29:03.899
Operation "Eggscuse me,
time to die!"

29:03.932 --> 29:06.603
And be sure to say that
when you shoot it in the brain.

30:13.102 --> 30:15.104
What is he doing?

30:16.238 --> 30:18.106
I don't know.

30:25.381 --> 30:28.351
Dick, I don't pay you
to flirt with inanimate objects!

30:28.384 --> 30:31.453
I got a guy for that.
Name's Howard.

30:45.099 --> 30:47.702
- Eagle's landed.
- Ah! Excellent!

30:47.736 --> 30:51.741
Now to play my favorite game
in the whole wide world.

30:51.773 --> 30:53.708
- Ah, the waiting game.
- Checkers!

30:53.741 --> 30:55.644
Is everything alright?

30:56.744 --> 30:58.146
Dick?

30:58.180 --> 30:59.481
So that's why you brought
that along.

30:59.515 --> 31:01.217
Yes.

31:01.250 --> 31:04.353
Why else would I bring checkers
along if not to play checkers?

31:04.385 --> 31:07.189
I think the eggshells
were just talking to me.

31:07.221 --> 31:09.224
They were talking to you?

31:10.192 --> 31:12.228
They were communicating.

31:12.260 --> 31:15.030
Like we had some sort
of strange connection.

31:17.432 --> 31:19.535
What possible reason
could there be

31:19.567 --> 31:22.504
for bringing a game
such as this to the beach

31:22.538 --> 31:25.474
without the intent to play it
amongst friends?

31:26.474 --> 31:28.243
I don't know.

31:30.778 --> 31:32.580
I'm docking your pay.

31:35.250 --> 31:36.752
Seafield, it's here.

31:41.722 --> 31:43.725
Where? Off the starboard?

31:43.759 --> 31:45.661
No, it's headed toward the egg!

31:45.693 --> 31:49.432
Ah! Alright, Sean Shaughnessy.
Time to make your country proud.

31:49.464 --> 31:52.268
It's closing in!

31:59.340 --> 32:01.342
Bingo!

32:01.375 --> 32:04.279
- This one's for you, daddy!
- Daddy?

32:21.696 --> 32:24.699
Aargh!

32:24.732 --> 32:25.701
Sean!

33:38.539 --> 33:43.444
Sean Shaughnessy was a better
man than most of our team.

33:43.478 --> 33:47.950
I'll never forget the day
I recruited him... Tuesday.

33:47.982 --> 33:49.751
He was bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed,

33:49.785 --> 33:51.387
and ready to get to work.

33:51.420 --> 33:55.758
He said, "Seafield, I am
your sword, I am your shield,

33:55.790 --> 33:58.493
"I am your weapons expert."

33:58.527 --> 34:01.230
Sean said that?

34:01.262 --> 34:02.731
He did.

34:05.534 --> 34:07.903
That was only the second time
anyone had ever said that to me.

34:07.935 --> 34:11.306
Well, I'll always remember
how brave he was.

34:11.340 --> 34:13.809
Whether charging into the lake
to fight the monster

34:13.842 --> 34:17.813
or discharging a firearm
on a public beach,

34:17.846 --> 34:19.981
Sean didn't care, he was brave.

34:20.014 --> 34:22.451
I don't have
any fond memories of Sean.

34:22.483 --> 34:23.885
Mostly because I'm pretty sure

34:23.918 --> 34:26.521
he shot and killed
my unborn child.

34:26.554 --> 34:28.389
You know, I had
a sneaking suspicion.

34:28.422 --> 34:29.791
Wait, what?

34:29.824 --> 34:33.527
- That egg was mine, wasn't it?
- Well... not yours.

34:33.561 --> 34:38.000
It's the monster's egg, Dick.
But yes! You made it happen.

34:38.032 --> 34:40.735
I had a dream regarding it.

34:40.768 --> 34:43.504
Oh, what? Are you upset?

34:43.538 --> 34:46.375
It was a monster baby!

34:46.407 --> 34:47.742
You should've at least told me

34:47.775 --> 34:49.877
before you let Sean shoot
the shit out of it!

34:49.911 --> 34:51.679
What does it even matter?

34:51.713 --> 34:54.617
Were you really going to raise
a grotesque hell spawn?

34:56.318 --> 34:58.653
- In this economy?
- I'm confused.

34:58.686 --> 35:00.521
It wasn't your call to make,
Seafield!

35:00.554 --> 35:04.826
Oh, I'm sorry!
Please forgive me!

35:04.860 --> 35:06.862
You're right!

35:06.894 --> 35:11.300
Ooh! We should've constructed
a large nest for it.

35:11.333 --> 35:14.802
Have Papa Dick nurture
the egg day and night

35:14.835 --> 35:17.472
for several weeks
under his loins,

35:17.505 --> 35:20.975
until one day the egg
decides to hatch

35:21.009 --> 35:23.478
and bite our fucking heads off!

35:23.512 --> 35:26.414
- I would make a great dad!
- Wait, that's it...

35:26.447 --> 35:28.384
It must've happened during
Operation Nauty Lady

35:28.416 --> 35:29.652
when Dick was naked.

35:29.684 --> 35:32.020
The monster seized him,
pulled him underwater,

35:32.054 --> 35:33.822
and somehow extracted his...

35:33.855 --> 35:36.525
Yes, very good, Nedge. We don't
have to go into graphic detail,

35:36.557 --> 35:37.693
you sick weirdo.

35:37.726 --> 35:39.628
I'm done with you,
Seafield.

35:39.661 --> 35:42.664
Your father,
he can burn in hell!

35:42.697 --> 35:44.632
Oh, why don't you go shoot
a timpani player,

35:44.666 --> 35:46.735
you big treasonous seaman?

35:46.768 --> 35:48.536
Hey! What are you doing here?

35:48.570 --> 35:50.506
You can't be digging
in a cemetery!

35:50.539 --> 35:52.041
That's vandalism!

35:52.074 --> 35:55.411
Seafield, you're vandals and
felons! I'm calling the cops!

35:55.443 --> 35:57.679
- Let's go, outta here.
- Get back here!

35:57.713 --> 36:00.481
'Uh, mission failed.

36:00.514 --> 36:03.851
'Failed. Failed. Failed!'

36:03.885 --> 36:06.522
Oh, God! Why is this so hard?

36:11.693 --> 36:15.731
What really happened that day,
Seafield?

36:15.764 --> 36:18.599
What day? There are many days.

36:18.632 --> 36:19.934
The day your father disappeared.

36:19.967 --> 36:21.903
I already told you
what happened.

36:21.936 --> 36:24.105
Look, I know you pay us a lot,

36:24.139 --> 36:27.776
and it's not really
my place to ask,

36:27.809 --> 36:29.612
but... come on.

36:31.612 --> 36:33.081
What?

36:33.114 --> 36:35.750
You took your boat from the
dock, immediately ran aground,

36:35.784 --> 36:37.653
decided to start fishing,

36:37.686 --> 36:40.923
and then the monster attacked
your father and took him away.

36:40.956 --> 36:42.524
Took him away and killed him!

36:42.556 --> 36:44.926
You told us your father
was a seasoned ship captain.

36:44.960 --> 36:47.128
This sounds like the work
of a small child

36:47.161 --> 36:49.564
or someone who's a drunk.

36:49.597 --> 36:52.433
Well, he was, Nedge! And he'd
been drinking all morning.

36:52.467 --> 36:53.936
I wasn't much more
fair for ware

36:53.969 --> 36:57.505
because you see I, too, am
a drunk. As is Ashcroft.

36:57.539 --> 37:00.743
And no, my father was not
a seasoned ship captain.

37:00.775 --> 37:02.744
I never said this,
you assumed this.

37:02.777 --> 37:05.446
Just as you assumed
I was a ship captain.

37:05.480 --> 37:07.949
As you probably assumed
Ashcroft is, too.

37:07.983 --> 37:10.419
It's hard not to assume
your father was a ship captain

37:10.452 --> 37:12.955
when you told us
your father was a ship captain.

37:12.987 --> 37:15.456
- Oh, I never said such a thing!
- Yes, you did!

37:15.489 --> 37:17.058
At the beginning
of all of this.

37:17.092 --> 37:19.728
A-ha... A-ha!

37:19.760 --> 37:22.898
Well, that must've just been
one of my little lying fits.

37:22.931 --> 37:25.800
I do that an awful lot
to make up for the fact

37:25.833 --> 37:27.902
that I don't actually have
a lot going for me.

37:27.936 --> 37:31.539
No, what about your house here?
You have a beautiful house.

37:31.572 --> 37:33.107
It's all illusion, Nedge!

37:33.141 --> 37:36.445
A simple parlor trick in which
a man moves into a lighthouse

37:36.478 --> 37:39.581
and pretends to be someone other
than the museum's docent.

37:39.614 --> 37:41.849
- So this is a museum?
- Yes!

37:41.882 --> 37:45.453
- Not your house.
- No.

37:45.487 --> 37:47.523
- And you're a docent here?
- And a fraud!

37:47.556 --> 37:49.590
We're all just a bunch
of frauds, Nedge.

37:49.623 --> 37:51.426
I'm the biggest charlatan
of them all.

37:51.460 --> 37:54.496
At least my father
and Ashcroft were sailors.

37:54.528 --> 37:56.632
I just stay cooped up
in my lighthouse villa

37:56.664 --> 37:59.101
playing make-believe
with my old-ass wife.

37:59.134 --> 38:01.135
You mean the state's lighthouse.

38:01.168 --> 38:04.839
There I go again, pretending!
This hat? A costume prop!

38:04.873 --> 38:08.844
This ivory? Real ivory!
Not mine! The museum's!

38:08.876 --> 38:10.978
In fact, I'm actually pretty
surprised none of you picked up

38:11.012 --> 38:13.916
on the sheer blatantness
that this is clearly a museum.

38:15.250 --> 38:16.652
Hmm!

38:17.686 --> 38:18.921
Dude, sick.

38:18.954 --> 38:20.722
- Yeah, sick.
- Sick.

38:20.755 --> 38:24.492
Okay, but why are you being
this con man?

38:24.525 --> 38:28.730
Because...
if I hadn't pretended

38:28.762 --> 38:31.733
to be this wealthy mariner...

38:33.268 --> 38:36.070
...none of you would've
helped me to my cause.

38:36.103 --> 38:40.074
I never had a mother and
I just want to find my father.

38:40.108 --> 38:42.744
These checks aren't good,
are they?

38:45.280 --> 38:47.716
Nedge! Don't go!

38:47.748 --> 38:50.017
Reconsider! Please!

38:50.050 --> 38:52.520
Those checks,
they might not be good,

38:52.554 --> 38:56.892
but I'm still a pretty fun guy
to hang out with!

38:56.925 --> 38:59.862
Come on!
Captain Cool over here!

38:59.894 --> 39:04.599
You know... Look, please, I'll
do anything. I'll rob a bank!

♪ I can see the waters

39:28.657 --> 39:34.863

Seafield! Knock it off!
You're a terrible singer.

40:07.596 --> 40:08.963
Sorry.

40:09.864 --> 40:12.067
Did you buy a house?

40:16.271 --> 40:18.673
- 'Tis a sublease.
- Oh.

40:21.976 --> 40:25.179
Remember the first time
dad took us out on the boat?

40:25.213 --> 40:27.716
How could I forget?

40:27.748 --> 40:30.217
I was five years old.

40:30.251 --> 40:33.822
You couldn't have been more
than eight or nine at the time.

40:33.855 --> 40:35.690
We were so scared that day,

40:35.724 --> 40:39.027
dad taking us out on the sea
for the first time.

40:39.059 --> 40:42.730
Couple of landlubbers like us,
huh? Times have changed.

40:42.764 --> 40:46.268
But he said, "Don't be scared.
Everything will be alright.

40:46.300 --> 40:49.337
"This'll be a fun time.
I'll keep you safe."

40:49.371 --> 40:52.874
He also said, "If either one
of you should get seasick

40:52.907 --> 40:55.611
"and throw up all over the deck,

40:55.643 --> 40:59.981
I will take my harpoon gun and
I will shoot you in the face."

41:00.014 --> 41:01.817
Then, of course,
you did get sick

41:01.849 --> 41:04.118
and the rest is history,
as we may say.

41:04.152 --> 41:05.753
Funny guy, dad.

41:05.786 --> 41:07.388
Well, he did
the best he could

41:07.422 --> 41:10.159
as a single teenage father.

41:16.864 --> 41:19.634
Go to the catacombs.

41:22.336 --> 41:24.338
The catacombs?
Are you mad? No!

41:24.371 --> 41:26.007
- You must!
- I mustn't.

41:26.041 --> 41:27.909
- I think you should.
- Why should I?

41:27.942 --> 41:31.246
You killed the monster's child.
Now you're cursed.

41:31.278 --> 41:33.815
Well, actually the dead guy,
Sean Shaughnessy,

41:33.847 --> 41:35.916
he's the one who killed
the monster's child.

41:35.949 --> 41:38.319
I just told him to.
Ipso facto...

41:38.353 --> 41:40.021
Even worse!

41:40.054 --> 41:44.158
A man whom you have cursed
and later led to the slaughter.

41:44.192 --> 41:46.695
Yep, here it is.

41:46.728 --> 41:50.766
The wandering cursed spirit
will not rest

41:50.798 --> 41:57.905
until it brings the cursee's
life to a resounding end.

41:59.873 --> 42:01.742
What can I do, Ashcroft?

42:01.775 --> 42:04.745
You're a dead man walking,
Seafield.

42:04.778 --> 42:07.014
Might as well avenge
the old man's death

42:07.047 --> 42:10.751
and your friend's death
while you still can.

42:10.784 --> 42:13.321
Go to the catacombs.

43:09.978 --> 43:11.880
Fore!

43:13.213 --> 43:16.784
Hey, sorry about that, fellas...
Whoa, Dick! Nedge!

43:16.818 --> 43:20.355
What are you guys doing here?
Ice cream sandwiches?

43:20.387 --> 43:22.090
What do you want, Seafield?

43:22.123 --> 43:24.291
Alright, you've seen through my
ruse. I wasn't actually golfing.

43:24.324 --> 43:26.527
- Yeah, no shit.
- Get out of here, Seafield.

43:26.561 --> 43:28.296
Look, I'm sorry about before.

43:28.329 --> 43:30.031
But now I've come
to right the wrong

43:30.063 --> 43:31.832
of not paying you
for your services

43:31.865 --> 43:34.235
by paying you for your services!

43:34.268 --> 43:36.971
- You don't have the money.
- I'll sell my pontoon!

43:37.005 --> 43:39.041
You killed my unborn child.

43:40.440 --> 43:43.878
- I'll sell my pontoon.
- You mean the museum's pontoon.

43:43.911 --> 43:47.782
Ha-ha! Very funny,
Nedge the hedge. Right?

43:47.815 --> 43:49.850
What kind of services
are you even talking about?

43:49.884 --> 43:51.552
Security of my life.

43:51.585 --> 43:52.953
The weapon's bag
is in the graveyard.

43:52.987 --> 43:54.155
And we're not weapons experts.

43:54.188 --> 43:55.923
I don't care about any of that!

43:55.956 --> 43:58.292
Look, I'm going to be going up
against a lot of moving parts

43:58.326 --> 44:00.028
in the near future.

44:00.061 --> 44:02.998
I need trustworthy, reliable,
dependable people by my side.

44:03.030 --> 44:04.431
Besides, you know the old adage:

44:04.465 --> 44:06.201
"Six pairs of eyes
are better than two."

44:06.233 --> 44:07.869
Not an old adage.

44:07.902 --> 44:10.838
You mean: "Three pairs of eyes
are better than one."

44:10.871 --> 44:13.875
Yes, if I were Ashcroft
and only had one pair of eyes,

44:13.907 --> 44:15.277
that would be correct.

44:15.309 --> 44:17.311
But I have two pairs of eyes
and there are two of you,

44:17.344 --> 44:19.980
so that makes it
six pairs of eyes.

44:20.014 --> 44:23.218
You know one pair of eyes
makes two eyeballs?

44:23.251 --> 44:25.519
A pear is also a fruit, Nedge.

44:25.552 --> 44:29.857
In that case, yes, a pair
of pears would be two pear.

44:29.891 --> 44:33.461
Two pairs of two pears
would be four pears.

44:33.494 --> 44:36.264
No! There would be two pear.

44:36.297 --> 44:39.501
- Two pairs of pears?
- No!

44:39.534 --> 44:42.971
- Or two pear.
- Yes, that's right.

44:43.003 --> 44:48.309
As if you're describing
the plural form of "pear"...

44:48.342 --> 44:50.911
In its singular form!

44:50.945 --> 44:53.615
Oh! So you think "pear"
is like "deer"?

44:53.648 --> 44:55.383
Or "lamb".

44:55.416 --> 44:59.187
No! A pear is a fruit!

44:59.219 --> 45:00.955
Bye, Seafield.

45:35.456 --> 45:37.593
Aargh... Aargh!

45:41.396 --> 45:43.398

Well?

58:42.242 --> 58:44.746
You're not good at this game,
Mr. Ghost.

58:46.947 --> 58:49.849
'This is Ghost 4
coming in on can 2.

58:49.882 --> 58:52.185
'Like I said, this is
Ghost 4 coming in on can 2.'

58:52.219 --> 58:55.121
Can you read me? Seafield,
we are having trouble down here.

58:55.155 --> 58:57.191
Troop leaders getting
demolished by this thing.

58:57.224 --> 58:59.994
We were not prepared for the
magnitude of this hellish beast.

59:00.027 --> 59:02.396
Oh! Oh, good God!

59:02.429 --> 59:06.099
Oh! Oh, Seafield,
we need to reassess our plan.

59:06.132 --> 59:09.069
We're losing a lot of good
ghosts. And we need a moment...

59:14.942 --> 59:17.744
The battle wages on.
Your move.

59:27.521 --> 59:32.159
You're worse
than Martha. And she's senile.

59:32.192 --> 59:34.027
Uh?

59:46.472 --> 59:48.809
It was a massacre.

01:00:03.891 --> 01:00:07.094
'Stop sending
daddy's Ghost Army.

01:00:07.126 --> 01:00:09.463
Come fight me yourself!'

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:15.463
What...?

01:01:17.097 --> 01:01:19.500
- Oh!
- Die!

01:01:51.565 --> 01:01:53.400
A-ha-ha!

01:03:11.744 --> 01:03:15.148
Uh?

01:03:57.690 --> 01:03:59.759
Oh...

01:04:59.686 --> 01:05:02.088
Must be imagining things.

01:05:09.728 --> 01:05:11.131
What are you doing?

01:05:12.599 --> 01:05:14.035
What?

01:05:16.103 --> 01:05:17.371
What?

01:05:18.871 --> 01:05:20.840
Monster?

01:05:20.873 --> 01:05:23.076
In there?

01:05:27.313 --> 01:05:29.148
No! No, no, no, no.

01:05:29.181 --> 01:05:31.150
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on
one second. Wait, wait, wait.

01:05:31.184 --> 01:05:33.253
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:05:33.286 --> 01:05:35.489
No, no, no, Mr. Ghost,
you go in there first.

01:05:35.521 --> 01:05:37.623
I vowed my life to you people.

01:05:37.657 --> 01:05:40.760
Now, get in there
and make something happen.

01:05:40.793 --> 01:05:42.496
I believe in you.

01:06:02.882 --> 01:06:04.451
Shh!

01:06:15.394 --> 01:06:17.364
Ooh!

01:06:17.396 --> 01:06:19.565
Shh! Shh!

01:06:19.599 --> 01:06:21.702
Jesus! Goddamnit!

01:07:25.498 --> 01:07:26.867
Father.

01:07:58.530 --> 01:08:01.634
All out of patsies are we,
darling?

01:08:04.704 --> 01:08:06.539
Sea hag!

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.775
I shall have my revenge!

01:08:09.809 --> 01:08:12.746
For my brother!

01:08:14.748 --> 01:08:19.386
Well, that was my revenge
for my unborn child!

01:08:19.417 --> 01:08:22.854
Well, that was my revenge
for my father!

01:08:28.295 --> 01:08:31.363
Well, that was my revenge...

01:08:31.398 --> 01:08:33.567
for your father...

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:36.737
harpooning my mother to death!

01:08:39.572 --> 01:08:42.542
Oh, boo-hoo,
he harpooned my mother, too.

01:08:44.978 --> 01:08:46.680
Come here, baby...

01:08:56.055 --> 01:09:00.560
Seafield, he harpooned
my mother and your mother.

01:09:02.028 --> 01:09:04.430
Seafield...

01:09:04.462 --> 01:09:06.899
we have the same parents.

01:09:13.471 --> 01:09:15.376
Try to remember.

01:09:26.353 --> 01:09:28.555
Blasphemy!

01:09:28.587 --> 01:09:31.024
- What...?
- Liar!

01:09:40.466 --> 01:09:42.036
Damn!

01:10:05.492 --> 01:10:08.962
Uh... you must be
a visual learner.

01:10:16.970 --> 01:10:21.408
'Yes, we are kin,
Seafield.

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:23.577
'When the three of us
were little,

01:10:23.609 --> 01:10:26.145
'our father was a drunkard.

01:10:26.179 --> 01:10:28.849
'Every night after work,
he would get hammered

01:10:28.881 --> 01:10:32.152
'and head to the lake to see
our hideous sea monster mother,

01:10:32.185 --> 01:10:35.822
'and love her for who she was.

01:10:35.854 --> 01:10:41.427
'But one day, he went
to the liquor store at 12:05,

01:10:41.461 --> 01:10:43.963
'five minutes after closing,

01:10:43.997 --> 01:10:49.101
'and could not purchase
any ice-cold Milwaukee brews.

01:10:49.135 --> 01:10:53.105
'He went home sober.

01:10:53.139 --> 01:10:55.876
'Upon seeing his wife through
sober eyes for the first time,

01:10:55.908 --> 01:10:57.911
'he was shocked
at her disgusting face

01:10:57.944 --> 01:11:00.046
'and immediately harpooned her,

01:11:00.078 --> 01:11:04.583
'leaving the three of us
without a mother.

01:11:04.617 --> 01:11:06.485
'I have no patience for men

01:11:06.519 --> 01:11:09.756
'who come home sober
and beat their wives.

01:11:09.788 --> 01:11:11.724
'So when I came of killing age,

01:11:11.757 --> 01:11:14.027
'I took vengeance
upon the old man.

01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:17.664
'This gave me peace.

01:11:17.697 --> 01:11:21.734
'Now, I want to put
our violent past behind us.

01:11:21.768 --> 01:11:25.639
'So I birthed a child
by the naked swimming man.

01:11:25.671 --> 01:11:27.506
'But you rejected
this peace offering

01:11:27.539 --> 01:11:29.576
'and killed your own nephew,

01:11:29.609 --> 01:11:33.680
'so I settled the score
with Ashcroft.

01:11:33.712 --> 01:11:37.183
'Now that we are even
once more, I ask you...'

01:11:42.255 --> 01:11:48.127
Brother, let us make peace
and end this cycle of vengeance.

01:12:01.707 --> 01:12:03.777
Come here, big sis!

01:12:03.810 --> 01:12:06.546
Oh! Come here, little bro!

01:12:06.578 --> 01:12:10.483
- I'm sorry!
- I'm sorry, too!

01:12:10.516 --> 01:12:13.220
- Bring it in!
- Bring it in.

01:12:33.139 --> 01:12:35.509
I didn't believe your story
for a second!

01:12:35.542 --> 01:12:38.545
It's true! I'm not lying!

01:12:38.578 --> 01:12:40.146
It's all lies!

01:12:40.179 --> 01:12:45.118
Everyone knows Milwaukee liquor
stores close at 9:00 not 12:00!

01:12:45.150 --> 01:12:49.188
Seafield, I'm your sister.
How could you kill your own...?

01:12:49.221 --> 01:12:52.192
Wait... 9:00?

01:12:52.225 --> 01:12:56.029
- 9:00pm?
- Yeah, I know.

01:12:57.697 --> 01:13:00.300
That's just so early.

01:13:00.332 --> 01:13:02.301
I know, I know.
It's actually ridiculous.

01:13:02.335 --> 01:13:04.671
I want to hear their reasoning
on that, you know.

01:13:04.703 --> 01:13:07.072
Granted. I think we would
all appreciate that.

01:13:07.105 --> 01:13:09.576
I mean, I don't have
the numbers in front of me...

01:13:09.609 --> 01:13:11.578
- Well...
- How is that... I mean...

01:13:11.610 --> 01:13:12.778
Who's that helping?

01:13:12.811 --> 01:13:15.215
I honestly think
the idea is that, uh...

01:13:15.247 --> 01:13:18.918
people will go out to bars
and restaurants, spend money.

01:13:18.952 --> 01:13:20.820
Help support the local economy,

01:13:20.853 --> 01:13:22.855
I think that's where
their heads are at, anyways.

01:13:25.257 --> 01:13:27.560
Maybe.

01:13:27.594 --> 01:13:30.630
Maybe, huh... Some of these
ordinances, I tell you.

01:13:30.662 --> 01:13:32.298
Some of these ordinances,
indeed.

01:13:32.332 --> 01:13:34.935
- Huh!
- Hmm...

01:13:38.871 --> 01:13:41.307
And now to get my revenge!

01:13:43.676 --> 01:13:45.745
I've avenged you, father!

01:13:45.778 --> 01:13:48.148
I am a hero!

01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:50.550
Everyone, take heed!

01:13:55.822 --> 01:13:58.225
Ah... Oh...

01:14:08.234 --> 01:14:10.037
Thank you.

01:14:11.738 --> 01:14:13.606
Aargh! Ow!

01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:16.209
Thank you for avenging me.

01:14:20.012 --> 01:14:22.649
Oh... ha-ha-ha!

01:14:22.681 --> 01:14:26.319
Rest in peace, Sean Shaughnessy.
