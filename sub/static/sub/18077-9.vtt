00:03.607 --> 00:05.871
Looks like these folks
don't want to listen
to the A-Team, Face.

00:06.176 --> 00:08.542
Think you can take on
B.A. Baracus?

00:08.612 --> 00:10.546
Somebody is going around
saying they're the A-Team.

00:12.949 --> 00:14.678
[ululating]

00:15.185 --> 00:17.050
He always go on like this?

00:18.188 --> 00:19.712
lt's like
a old-fashioned showdown.

00:20.157 --> 00:21.419
We are the A-Team.

00:21.691 --> 00:23.056
[screaming]

00:25.695 --> 00:27.686
You must remain
our secret weapon.

00:30.233 --> 00:31.700
There's only one A-Team.

00:33.703 --> 00:36.001
(male narrator)
In 1972,
a crack commando unit...

00:36.072 --> 00:37.937
was sent to prison
by a military court...

00:38.008 --> 00:39.498
for a crime
they didn't commit.

00:39.576 --> 00:40.838
These men promptly escaped...

00:40.911 --> 00:42.401
from a maximum-security
stockade...

00:42.479 --> 00:44.003
to the Los Angeles
underground.

00:44.080 --> 00:45.775
Today, still wanted
by the government...

00:45.849 --> 00:47.749
they survive
as soldiers of fortune.

00:47.818 --> 00:50.218
If you have a problem,
if no one else can help...

00:50.287 --> 00:51.720
and if you can find them...

00:51.788 --> 00:53.847
maybe you can hire
the A-Team.

02:44.134 --> 02:47.103
l don't know what you're
still practicing for, Carrie.

02:49.105 --> 02:51.573
l doubt this show's
going to go on.

02:51.975 --> 02:53.374
[birds chirping]

02:53.443 --> 02:55.604
l just can't accept it, Dad.

02:57.380 --> 03:01.111
l mean, already
half our people have been
scared off and the others....

03:01.618 --> 03:04.246
l just don't know
how much more they can take.

03:04.321 --> 03:06.221
We can't do it, Carrie.

03:06.389 --> 03:07.617
We're dead.

03:07.691 --> 03:10.626
l mean, nobody can
go up against the A-Team.

03:13.096 --> 03:15.257
Dad, why are they doing it?

03:15.332 --> 03:18.665
Why is the A-Team working
for a guy like Kyle Mason?

03:21.204 --> 03:22.694
l don't know.

03:23.506 --> 03:27.237
Ever since Mason found out
about our European tour...

03:27.310 --> 03:29.574
and l refused
to sell to him, why...

03:29.646 --> 03:31.944
it's just been hell
around here.

03:33.750 --> 03:37.117
Carrie, l'm usually
a fighter.
Me, too, Dad.

03:37.654 --> 03:40.817
Now, we just can't
give up. We can't.

03:40.890 --> 03:44.189
You know how much
l want to take
this show to Europe.

03:44.394 --> 03:46.658
But it's just not
going to happen.

03:46.730 --> 03:50.461
l mean, there comes a time
when you know it's over.

03:50.533 --> 03:53.161
l hate them
for what they're doing to you.

[horses neighing]

04:38.882 --> 04:40.179
Are you out of your mind?

04:40.250 --> 04:42.309
Firing a weapon
around all these people
and animals...

04:42.385 --> 04:44.216
is just plain stupid!

04:44.621 --> 04:46.486
lt's just my way
of getting
your attention.

04:46.556 --> 04:48.023
Yeah, we like people
to listen.

04:48.091 --> 04:49.353
What do you think
you're doing?

04:49.426 --> 04:51.087
You just get out of here.
You're trespassing.

04:51.628 --> 04:53.425
You got spunk.
l like that.

04:53.496 --> 04:55.327
Maybe you could
join the A-Team.

04:55.398 --> 04:56.387
[spits]

04:56.466 --> 04:58.331
That's what l think
of the A-Team.

04:58.401 --> 04:59.595
Why, you.

04:59.669 --> 05:01.000
[grunting]

05:01.071 --> 05:04.234
l'm going to get you
for this! You're going
to pay for this! You're--

[Winnetka coughing]

05:10.480 --> 05:11.777
[groaning]

05:16.019 --> 05:17.782

B.A. Baracus?

05:19.456 --> 05:20.821
[grunting]

05:24.794 --> 05:26.125

05:35.805 --> 05:37.466
Anybody else want
to be a hero?

05:39.042 --> 05:40.634
[birds chirping]

05:43.847 --> 05:45.178
[groaning]

05:47.717 --> 05:49.617
This is Mason's last offer.

05:49.686 --> 05:52.018
$10,000 for
your Wild West Show.

05:52.355 --> 05:54.846
That's very generous.
l'd take it, if l were you.

05:54.924 --> 05:58.087
l thought the A-Team
was supposed to help people.

05:58.161 --> 06:00.391
Your boss here went
and got himself snakebit.

06:00.463 --> 06:01.760
(Parker)
lf you people were smart...

06:01.831 --> 06:04.265
you'd start looking
for another job
while you're still able to.

06:13.910 --> 06:15.571
[tires screeching]

06:27.790 --> 06:29.724
(Face)
You're going
to love this place.

06:31.127 --> 06:32.924
No, no, the food's terrific.

06:32.996 --> 06:34.054
You hang out here a lot?

06:34.130 --> 06:35.995
Hang out here?
l practically own the place.

06:36.065 --> 06:37.191
Here, have a seat.

06:37.267 --> 06:39.792
Yeah, you know,
it's a home away from home.

06:40.003 --> 06:43.734
Most of the guys here
are old war buddies
of mine. Hi, Sarge.

06:45.675 --> 06:49.736
Hey, Peck, go find
yourself another place
to chow down in, huh?

06:49.812 --> 06:52.076
We don't want
your kind around here.

06:52.148 --> 06:53.740
Old war buddies, huh?

06:53.816 --> 06:55.340
lsn't he great?

06:55.418 --> 06:58.581
Yeah, l keep telling him,
with a delivery like that
he ought to be in the movies.

06:58.988 --> 07:01.582
Hey, Sarge,
do your Bogart impression.

07:02.158 --> 07:05.389
You ought to be more careful
with the company you keep.
He's a bum.

07:05.461 --> 07:07.691
That's funny. You know,
you're a funny guy, Sarge.

07:07.764 --> 07:09.459
You don't see me laughing,
do you, Peck?

07:09.532 --> 07:10.726
l think we better go.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.530
You want to tell me
what's going on here?

07:14.637 --> 07:15.729
This.

07:16.673 --> 07:18.163
Yesterday's newspaper.

07:18.241 --> 07:21.233
lt seems
you made Joe lvy's column.

07:22.212 --> 07:24.908
Anybody here want to meet
a prized creep?

07:26.616 --> 07:29.084
All right, keep at him.
Keep at him. Look out!

07:29.152 --> 07:31.245
Watch out, all right,
pretty move. All right, now.

07:34.357 --> 07:35.688
All right,
that was a good shot.

07:35.758 --> 07:37.419
But we're still
going to practice more.

07:37.493 --> 07:38.551
We can do
better than that.

07:38.628 --> 07:40.562
Remember, whenever
you get caught in a jam...

07:40.630 --> 07:41.597
pass the ball off.

07:41.664 --> 07:45.600
Don't always go
for that fancy passing through
a man's legs, all right?

07:45.668 --> 07:46.862
Hey! What you guys doing?

07:46.936 --> 07:48.267
Come on,
get some of this education.

07:50.340 --> 07:51.807
What's wrong?

08:17.333 --> 08:20.131
Hannibal, do you believe this?

08:20.303 --> 08:22.271
l read it. l believe it.

08:22.338 --> 08:24.203
(B.A.)
This is bad,
Hannibal. Real bad.

08:24.274 --> 08:26.299
Somebody's going around
saying they're the A-Team.

08:26.376 --> 08:27.365
There's only one A-Team.

08:27.443 --> 08:29.673
People are starting to believe
what they've been reading.

08:29.746 --> 08:31.213
l know, B.A., l know.

08:31.281 --> 08:33.977
''You've heard of them,
the legendary A-Team.

08:34.049 --> 08:36.018
''Three fugitives,
alone and on the run...

08:36.085 --> 08:38.315
''chased by the military police
wherever they go...

08:38.388 --> 08:41.152
''and yet these same men
have found the time,
over and over again...

08:41.224 --> 08:42.782
''to go to the aid
of those in need...

08:42.859 --> 08:44.656
''the helpless

Robin Hoods gone sour?

Or is this just a case
of the leopard revealing
its true spots?''

08:55.038 --> 08:59.236
You know, somebody thinks
it's good business to make
the A-Team look bad.

08:59.609 --> 09:01.600
These suckers gonna look bad
when l get through with them.

09:02.011 --> 09:04.479
Hannibal, you don't suppose
the military came up...

09:04.547 --> 09:06.913
with the idea of another
A-Team in order to...

09:06.983 --> 09:07.972
draw us out?

09:08.051 --> 09:10.519
l don't know. But they'd
try to use it either way.

09:10.586 --> 09:13.419
l say we go down
to that Wild West show
that lvy writes about...

09:13.489 --> 09:14.581
and flatten those phonies.

09:17.093 --> 09:20.085
B.A., l couldn't have said it
better myself.

09:20.163 --> 09:21.994
Face, spring Murdock
out of the hospital.

09:22.432 --> 09:23.456
Right.

09:23.533 --> 09:24.932
We're on our way
to Points West.

09:25.001 --> 09:26.093
Yeah!

09:30.740 --> 09:33.868
Thank heavens. Thank heavens
l got here in time.

09:34.544 --> 09:38.913
l'm Major Waldren, U.S. Army,
Department of Toxic Waste
and Medical Applications.

09:38.981 --> 09:40.972
(Face)
Thank goodness
you haven't opened that door.

09:41.050 --> 09:42.517
Door? What door?

09:42.585 --> 09:44.348
Here, put these on.

09:45.321 --> 09:48.586
Luckily, we managed
to isolate the spill-off.

09:49.726 --> 09:51.819
Of course, we're not sure
how much of the radiation...

09:51.894 --> 09:53.885
is coming
from the x-ray isotopes.

09:53.963 --> 09:55.089
lsotopes?

09:55.164 --> 09:56.825
Yeah. The boots,
the boots, quickly!

09:56.899 --> 09:59.424
Before the water leaks
through the door.

10:00.436 --> 10:03.064
Major Waldren, l don't know
what's going on here, sir.

10:03.139 --> 10:06.870
Well, we have a busted
water pipe in the medical
x-ray room.

10:06.943 --> 10:08.672
Yeah, it's water everywhere.

10:08.745 --> 10:10.372
Flooded Section 18,
Area Eight.

10:10.446 --> 10:13.711
That's Captain Murdock's
quarters, l believe.

10:15.785 --> 10:17.650
Let me see, here, yeah.

10:17.720 --> 10:19.119
But, Major, you can't go in.

10:19.188 --> 10:20.177
Shh! Shh!

10:20.256 --> 10:21.280
Uh-huh.

10:21.824 --> 10:24.793
(Face)
Oh, no, yeah, yeah.

10:25.795 --> 10:26.784
[sighs]

10:26.863 --> 10:28.854
Just what l was afraid of.

10:28.931 --> 10:30.296
[crackling]

10:31.267 --> 10:32.825
[water running]

10:35.405 --> 10:37.703
Don't get off the bed!

10:46.816 --> 10:50.650
See, our feeling is most
of the radiation is confined
to the water.

10:50.720 --> 10:53.518
So minimum contact
shouldn't be too dangerous.
But just remember...

10:53.589 --> 10:55.352
keep all the hallway doors
closed.

10:55.425 --> 10:56.858
Keep everyone
out of the corridor.

10:56.926 --> 11:00.919
Can l see the keys, please?
Captain Murdock shouldn't
be in Decontamination more...

11:00.997 --> 11:03.261
than three days.
Now, listen...

11:03.332 --> 11:04.594
[keys jingling]

11:04.667 --> 11:07.500
if nothing happens
to this radiation badge...

11:07.570 --> 11:10.095
that is
if it doesn't change color...

11:10.473 --> 11:12.441
that means
you haven't been exposed.

11:12.508 --> 11:14.066
You may
report to work tomorrow.

11:14.143 --> 11:16.907
But in the meantime,
hush-hush.

11:17.480 --> 11:21.473
Hush-hush. Right.
But if it changes--
Now, go, go, go, go. Quickly!

11:42.238 --> 11:44.001
Face, have you read
the newspaper lately?

11:44.073 --> 11:45.301
Murdoch, will you
get in the wheelchair?

11:45.374 --> 11:46.773
Have you read
the newspaper lately?

11:46.843 --> 11:47.969
Will you get
in the wheelchair?

11:48.044 --> 11:49.636
Have you read
the newspaper lately?
What?

11:49.712 --> 11:51.236
l want you to listen to this,
all right.

11:51.314 --> 11:52.906
''The legendary A-Team...

11:52.982 --> 11:55.542
three wanted fugitives
alone and on the run.''

11:55.618 --> 11:57.483
Three. Three.
Did you get that word?
Three.

11:57.553 --> 12:00.647
Face, l am just as much
a member of the A-Team
as you are...

12:00.723 --> 12:02.918
but my name, my name's
not in this newspaper.

12:02.992 --> 12:04.482
ls there something
l'm doing wrong?

12:04.560 --> 12:06.551
Well, look, Murdock,
technically you're not...

12:06.629 --> 12:07.891
on the run
with the rest of us.

12:07.964 --> 12:09.864
That's the whole reason
l have to come in here...

12:09.932 --> 12:13.163
and scam you out every time.
lf the military thought
you were one of us...

12:13.236 --> 12:15.204
they'd be on top of you
24 hours a day.

12:15.271 --> 12:17.364
l guess so.
But, you know...

12:17.540 --> 12:21.442
it kind of hurts you
when you never get
your name in the paper.

12:21.511 --> 12:24.002
l mean, it makes you
feel like, kinda like....

12:24.080 --> 12:26.605
You know,
you feel like an oddball.

12:26.682 --> 12:29.981
Now, Murdock,
you'll always be one of us.

12:30.286 --> 12:32.083
The question is,
which one.

12:32.154 --> 12:34.281
Did you remember
to turn off the faucet?

12:34.357 --> 12:37.155
l knew there was something
l forgot to do.

12:46.035 --> 12:47.798
[car doors closing]

12:50.039 --> 12:51.097
Sir!

12:52.909 --> 12:53.876
[sighs]

12:53.943 --> 12:55.706
Do you have anything
to report, Sergeant?

12:55.778 --> 12:57.405
The fake A-Team
showed up this morning...

12:57.480 --> 12:59.675
and leaned real hard
on Winnetka and his daughter
to sell.

12:59.749 --> 13:01.683
l am not interested
in the fake A-Team.

13:01.751 --> 13:04.481
The military gave me
one more shot
at the real A-Team...

13:04.554 --> 13:05.953
and l am not going to fail.

13:06.022 --> 13:07.114
No sign of them yet, sir.

13:07.456 --> 13:09.549
Do you think
they'll really show up,
Colonel?

13:09.625 --> 13:11.718
l mean, they have to know
it could be a trap.

13:11.794 --> 13:12.920
They'll show up.

13:12.995 --> 13:14.860
lt hasn't been that long
that l've forgotten
how Smith thinks.

13:15.431 --> 13:17.058
Trap or no trap...

13:17.133 --> 13:19.499
they'll show up
to set the record straight.

13:19.569 --> 13:21.059
And when they do...

13:21.137 --> 13:22.729
[grinding teeth]

13:22.872 --> 13:24.339
they're mine.

13:31.547 --> 13:34.778
You're looking real good,
Jimmy. That little pony
is going to work out fine.

13:38.487 --> 13:40.148
[truck door closing]

13:42.959 --> 13:44.119
Howdy.

13:44.393 --> 13:45.325
Howdy.

13:45.394 --> 13:46.691
What can l do for you boys?

13:47.296 --> 13:51.494
Well, we're looking
for the gentleman
who ramrods this gala.

13:52.034 --> 13:55.162
Well, you're looking at him.
Winnetka's the name.

13:55.237 --> 13:56.898
Rufus Cantrell, sir.

13:56.973 --> 13:58.702
And l'm proud
to make your acquaintance.

13:58.774 --> 14:01.709
lt's always a pleasure
to meet a true son
of the Old West.

14:02.945 --> 14:05.607
Got some mighty fine
animals in there, sir.

14:05.681 --> 14:07.308
Yes, mighty fine.

14:07.950 --> 14:09.713
My lone lndian brave
and l...

14:09.785 --> 14:11.047
[hissing]

14:11.387 --> 14:14.879
are considering a jaunt
along the sawdust trail.

14:15.591 --> 14:16.888
Looking for work, are you?

14:16.959 --> 14:19.154
Me and my brave
are looking for...

14:19.228 --> 14:20.855
gainful employment.

14:20.930 --> 14:24.627
l lend authenticity by singing
some Western ditties.

14:24.767 --> 14:26.860
[mumbling]

14:27.770 --> 14:29.761
Some fancy gunplay...

14:30.239 --> 14:33.174
and some slight of hands
with my deck of cards.

14:33.242 --> 14:36.939
My brave, he does
an interesting war dance.

14:37.013 --> 14:39.208
[ululating]

14:45.354 --> 14:48.755
And, tricks
with his tomahawk.

14:48.824 --> 14:50.314
[ululating]

14:52.995 --> 14:54.758
He talks to it, too.

15:00.436 --> 15:02.165
(Lynch)
The lndian's definitely
not one of them.

15:03.406 --> 15:05.397
He's too tall to be Peck.

15:06.976 --> 15:07.965
[sighs]

15:08.044 --> 15:09.944
What about the old man?

15:10.613 --> 15:12.410
Could it be Hannibal
in disguise?

15:12.481 --> 15:13.880
lt's too hard to tell.

15:13.949 --> 15:16.509
We can't move in until
all the A-Team is together.

15:16.585 --> 15:18.450
We make a run
on one or two of them...

15:18.521 --> 15:20.489
and the rest will never show.

15:20.556 --> 15:22.148
l want them all.

15:23.192 --> 15:24.181
lt hasn't been easy...

15:24.260 --> 15:26.353
but you know,
one thing about rodeoing...

15:26.429 --> 15:28.294
once you get a taste,
you can't give it up.

15:28.364 --> 15:30.195
Yeah, tell me about it.

15:30.266 --> 15:32.632
Yeah, it's been rodeos
for me all the way.

15:32.702 --> 15:37.366
Of course, there was that
one stunt in Monte Carlo
l did as a racecar driver.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.637
Monte Carlo?
Yeah.

15:39.709 --> 15:40.767
Wow!

15:41.510 --> 15:44.343
l've never even been
out of the United States.

15:44.413 --> 15:47.712
Of course, we were
planning on touring
through Europe but...

15:47.783 --> 15:50.377
it looks like
that's not gonna happen.

15:50.519 --> 15:52.646
Cheer up.
lt's not Monte Carlo...

15:52.722 --> 15:55.486
but we could buy
a brew and pizza, in Pomona.

15:55.558 --> 15:57.219
[exclaiming]

16:00.496 --> 16:02.225
You make me laugh.

16:02.298 --> 16:03.822
lt's the feet.

16:07.970 --> 16:09.198
[grunts]

16:10.306 --> 16:12.934
Boys, l got to
be honest with you.

16:13.943 --> 16:17.970
The reason l got openings
is because l've had a lot
of trouble around here.

16:18.047 --> 16:19.412
Well...

16:19.482 --> 16:22.645
trouble has never hesitated
or jarred Rufus Cantrell.

16:22.718 --> 16:24.208
[ululating]

16:27.957 --> 16:30.892
Mighty warrior,
where the mountain
touches the sky...

16:30.960 --> 16:32.757
where the rivers run deep...

16:32.828 --> 16:36.491
the trees, they bend
southward toward, toward...

16:37.199 --> 16:38.359
Santa Monica.

16:38.434 --> 16:41.130
All the signs are there,
oh, great one.

16:41.937 --> 16:43.837
The mighty buffalo
shall return.

16:43.906 --> 16:45.305
[ululating]

16:46.475 --> 16:48.500
He always go on like this?

16:49.011 --> 16:51.536
Ever since he lost
his other feather.

16:56.452 --> 16:58.317
Here comes
the new rodeo clown now.

16:58.387 --> 17:00.014
That's my daughter,
Carrie, with him.

17:00.089 --> 17:01.181
Mmm-hmm.

17:01.257 --> 17:02.485
Hi, Dad.

17:03.125 --> 17:05.184
So, what do you think
of our new clown?

17:05.261 --> 17:06.626
(Winnetka)
Fine, fine.

17:07.029 --> 17:09.554
l want you all
to meet two more
of our new performers.

17:09.632 --> 17:11.896
Mr. Cantrell,
and his brave, Mr....

17:11.967 --> 17:14.196
l am sorry,
l never did get your name.

17:14.270 --> 17:16.602
l am, Oh, Great Mighty...

17:16.672 --> 17:18.902
Troubled Warrior
Running Round.

17:20.309 --> 17:21.935
Well, l've got
a rodeo to run.

17:22.011 --> 17:24.877
l'll see you all
in the mess tent
for lunch.

17:28.751 --> 17:30.048
[sighing]

17:31.086 --> 17:32.075
Cute trick.

17:32.154 --> 17:35.453
Yeah. Look, Hannibal,
l'm not exactly delirious
about all this.

17:35.524 --> 17:37.754
lt's not going to put me
on any best-dressed list.

17:37.827 --> 17:39.920
Yeah, but it's a great cover.

17:39.995 --> 17:42.862
l got a feeling that Lynch
is watching us every minute.

17:42.932 --> 17:44.229
Hey, Faceman, how do l look?

17:45.301 --> 17:46.962
Like a million, Chief.

17:47.036 --> 17:48.435
l'm not a chief yet.
l'm a warrior.

17:49.738 --> 17:51.797
Well, now, we're all in.
What about B.A.?

17:51.874 --> 17:54.502
Yeah, well, actually
there were two openings.
One was...

17:54.577 --> 17:58.240
rodeo clown,
and the other was....

18:02.418 --> 18:03.749
[thudding]

18:12.194 --> 18:15.493
B.A., a shovel, now,
that's no disguise.

18:16.198 --> 18:17.722
l don't wear disguises,
Hannibal.

18:17.800 --> 18:20.132
Not even a feather
for your hair?

18:20.269 --> 18:21.793
Get this crazy fool
away from me.

18:21.871 --> 18:23.236
You ain't no real lndian.

18:23.305 --> 18:25.466
Real lndians don't look
and act like a crazy fool.

18:26.642 --> 18:29.805
Look, the main thing
is not to get spotted...

18:30.279 --> 18:32.406
standing all together, Face.

18:34.717 --> 18:37.015
B.A! B.A.,
look how about this hat?

18:37.086 --> 18:38.781
You could play
like you were a cowboy...

18:38.854 --> 18:40.981
and then it'd be just you
and me. Cowboys and lndians!

18:41.056 --> 18:42.580
l'm going to play
stagecoach, fool...

18:42.658 --> 18:44.285
and run you over
if you don't shut up.

18:44.360 --> 18:45.691
[grunts]

18:57.773 --> 18:59.434
[tires screeching]

18:59.775 --> 19:01.436
[birds twittering]

19:12.254 --> 19:15.690
[wind whistling]

19:25.367 --> 19:26.459
This five-ton baby hits...

19:26.535 --> 19:28.526
she'll take out
half the camp.

19:28.604 --> 19:31.072
An accident like that'll
close down the show real fast.

19:31.140 --> 19:32.164
[laughing]

19:32.241 --> 19:34.766
Like a cannonball
through a batch
of matchsticks.

19:34.843 --> 19:36.606
All right, let's go.

19:41.583 --> 19:43.574
Fire it up.
l'll spot you.

19:53.162 --> 19:54.254
Easy.

19:56.999 --> 19:58.523
Lock the wheel.

20:15.751 --> 20:17.878
Come on, folks.
lrish stew today.

20:17.953 --> 20:19.079
Let's get it
while it's hot, Peck.

20:20.022 --> 20:21.046
Hannibal!

20:24.960 --> 20:25.984
Warn the people.

21:36.832 --> 21:38.493
[tires screeching]

21:41.270 --> 21:44.831
That was incredible!
Just incredible!

21:44.940 --> 21:48.671
Your quick thinking
saved a lot of people
from getting hurt.

21:49.278 --> 21:52.111
Well, somebody
is awful anxious...

21:52.714 --> 21:54.739
to put you out
of business, Captain.

21:54.817 --> 21:58.344
Well, l didn't think
anybody could stand up
to the A-Team.

21:58.420 --> 22:01.912
Glad to hear you say that,
ma'am, because that's why
we came here.

22:01.990 --> 22:04.618
This is B.A. Baracus...

22:06.829 --> 22:09.423
this is Templeton Peck,
Faceman.

22:10.666 --> 22:12.896
This is Howlin' Mad Murdock...

22:13.502 --> 22:14.662
and...

22:16.705 --> 22:17.899
l'm Hannibal Smith.

22:20.709 --> 22:22.370
We are the A-Team.

22:39.328 --> 22:42.855
By the looks on your faces
I can tell I'm not going to
like what I'm going to hear.

22:43.866 --> 22:45.629
We did like you said, Mason.

22:45.701 --> 22:47.999
(Parker)
Except some guys showed up
and stopped the truck.

22:48.070 --> 22:50.095
The way they handled
themselves, they're pros.

22:50.172 --> 22:51.867
Pros? What the hell did I do?

22:51.940 --> 22:54.067
Hire myself
a bunch of amateurs?

22:54.143 --> 22:56.771
You wanted us
to lean on Winnetka
and we leaned on him. Hard.

22:56.845 --> 22:58.836
Obviously not
hard enough.

23:00.449 --> 23:02.644
l paid you clowns
for results.

23:02.851 --> 23:05.376
Winnetka was supposed
to think he was coming up
against the A-Team.

23:06.221 --> 23:09.054
And what do l have
to show for it? Nothing.

23:09.258 --> 23:10.919
Parker, come here.

23:10.993 --> 23:13.928
The cops are cracking
down on my European
connections.

23:13.996 --> 23:16.829
l need Winnetka's
overseas tour dates.

23:16.899 --> 23:20.198
A Wild West show
is a perfect cover
to pick up drugs.

23:20.402 --> 23:21.596
lt's just like a mail route.

23:22.004 --> 23:26.464
But Winnetka is counting
on his advance ticket sales
to meet his next payroll.

23:27.009 --> 23:29.944
l want you to see that
they never get to him.

23:30.512 --> 23:31.843
You got it?

23:35.551 --> 23:37.951
l am as much a member
of the A-Team as you are...

23:38.020 --> 23:39.487
and my name
was not in that paper.

23:39.555 --> 23:40.783
Now, did you hear Hannibal...

23:40.856 --> 23:42.756
introduce me as
a member of the A-Team?

23:42.824 --> 23:45.793
Well, l think the people
have a right to know
all of the facts.

23:45.861 --> 23:48.022
They should know who l am.
Murdock...

23:48.096 --> 23:50.564
we know you're a member
of the A-Team.

23:50.632 --> 23:52.759
That's the important thing.

23:52.935 --> 23:54.129
Besides, take it from me.

23:54.203 --> 23:56.967
Fame is just
a fleeting shadow.

23:57.873 --> 24:00.307
Just a passing breeze
in the storm.

24:01.043 --> 24:02.635
[birds chirping]

24:04.580 --> 24:06.445
[ululating]

24:12.688 --> 24:15.384
We will be able
to get out of this,
won't we, Peck?

24:15.457 --> 24:17.254
Of course we will.

24:17.326 --> 24:19.419
You're a fighter, remember?

24:19.695 --> 24:21.026
lt's going to be rough.

24:21.096 --> 24:23.860
Guys like Mason
hate taking no for an answer.

24:23.932 --> 24:28.699
But why would a rock promoter
go to all the trouble of
taking over a Wild West show?

24:28.770 --> 24:30.135
lt doesn't make sense.

24:30.205 --> 24:33.606
Look, if Mason
and his playmates show up
again we'll be ready for them.

24:33.675 --> 24:35.905
No one's going
to force your father
into selling his show.

24:36.545 --> 24:39.275
lt's a dream come true
for him, you know.

24:39.581 --> 24:42.379
All his life he's been
playing one-street towns.

24:42.451 --> 24:43.884
Half of them
not even on the map.

24:44.219 --> 24:47.620
Now he's got a chance to tour
the capitals of Europe.

24:47.689 --> 24:49.987
Well, no one's going to
stop him. That's a promise.

24:50.525 --> 24:51.617
Okay?

24:53.328 --> 24:54.420
Okay.

24:59.201 --> 25:01.431
You still think
the military's out there
watching you?

25:01.503 --> 25:03.471
Yeah. They're
out there somewhere.

25:03.572 --> 25:07.508
You spend your life
on the run, you learn to trust
in the things you can't see.

25:07.576 --> 25:10.067
Excuse me. Captain Winnetka
told me to store these away.

25:10.145 --> 25:12.306
Yeah, sure.
lt won't take but a second.

25:32.634 --> 25:34.898
Are you sure it's him, Wilson?

25:34.970 --> 25:36.870
Positive, Colonel.
lt's Peck, all right.

25:36.938 --> 25:39.304
He was disguised
as one of the rodeo clowns.

25:39.374 --> 25:41.672
Okay. So now we know
Peck is here, too.

25:41.743 --> 25:44.473
Baracus is here.
We have the two of them.

25:45.380 --> 25:46.847
lt's just a matter of Smith.

25:46.915 --> 25:49.247
l'm almost positive Smith
is here already, sir.

25:49.318 --> 25:50.979
Until we're certain
he's in the camp...

25:51.053 --> 25:52.611
and we can
positively identify him...

25:52.688 --> 25:56.146
we can't afford to move
in and risk revealing
our position, now, can we?

25:56.224 --> 25:58.590
Just continue to report
for the next two hours.

25:58.660 --> 25:59.922
Yes, sir.

26:09.271 --> 26:12.672
Smith, after all this time.

26:28.123 --> 26:29.784
[tires screeching]

26:32.461 --> 26:35.259
That wouldn't happen
to be the ticket receipts,
would it, Captain?

26:35.330 --> 26:36.991
Looks like l got
a welcoming committee.

26:37.065 --> 26:38.225
[chuckling]
You sure do, pop.

26:38.300 --> 26:39.858
Now, why don't l
just take that...

26:39.935 --> 26:42.335
mail sack
with those checks in it.

26:42.637 --> 26:44.764
l wish you hadn't said that.

26:46.541 --> 26:49.237
First, l'd like you
to meet the real A-Team.

26:49.311 --> 26:51.711
Second, you see that?

26:52.514 --> 26:54.607
That is a cheap cigar.

26:56.118 --> 26:57.881
Face, do you see me?

26:59.087 --> 27:00.452
[groaning]

27:02.090 --> 27:03.455
[screaming]

27:05.227 --> 27:06.592
[groaning]

27:15.270 --> 27:17.500
Hannibal, l can't find--
Where, where....

27:17.572 --> 27:20.666
Murdock,
they don't have a ''you.''

27:29.451 --> 27:31.612
You fools! You didn't
bring your Murdock.

27:31.686 --> 27:33.677
What is the matter,
phony Face...

27:33.755 --> 27:35.655
couldn't break him out?

27:37.559 --> 27:41.086
Hannibal, this is
the third time this month
l've got hit in the eye.

27:41.163 --> 27:43.154
l'm beginning to lose
my sense of humor.

27:43.231 --> 27:46.632
Face, a little ice
will do wonders.
And it looks good, huh?

27:46.701 --> 27:48.999
Gives him a little
needed character.

27:49.471 --> 27:50.802
Come on,
bring these guys along.

27:50.872 --> 27:53.306
We got a special delivery
to make.

28:01.082 --> 28:02.572
[men grunting]

28:04.519 --> 28:06.851
Okay, let's try it
one more time.

28:07.389 --> 28:10.119
Look, you're not playing
at a geriatrics ward
dance here.

28:10.192 --> 28:11.159
You are The Cave lns.

28:11.226 --> 28:13.217
l want the song
to begin with an explosion.

28:13.295 --> 28:14.694
[crashing]

28:17.532 --> 28:19.124
Freeze, suckers!

28:21.403 --> 28:23.701
Brothers and sisters,
we have arrived!

28:23.772 --> 28:26.570
l know we can make
beautiful music together.

28:26.641 --> 28:28.268
[cymbal crashing]

28:28.944 --> 28:30.707
What the hell is this?

28:30.779 --> 28:33.304
Got a special delivery
for Kyle Mason.

28:33.381 --> 28:35.815
You know,
the mail must go through.

28:37.519 --> 28:39.851
l hate barriers
in communication.

28:40.155 --> 28:41.486
[gun clicking]

28:49.197 --> 28:51.597
Whatever Winnetka
is paying you...

28:51.666 --> 28:53.861
l'll match it.
l'll double it.

28:55.303 --> 28:57.999
l like mathematical
progression but...

28:58.073 --> 28:59.802
we're a little picky
about who we work for.

29:00.208 --> 29:01.971
That's right, sucker.
Real picky.

29:02.310 --> 29:07.179
Now, there's two things.
One, l want you to lose
your newly acquired desire...

29:07.249 --> 29:10.377
to own
Captain Winnetka's
Wild West show.

29:10.986 --> 29:15.946
And two, it is not wise
to try to impersonate
the A-Team.

29:16.358 --> 29:19.816
That's us. Now, if you can't
remember what l told you...

29:20.061 --> 29:24.430
we will abandon our quiet
and peaceful demeanor...

29:24.499 --> 29:26.831
and come back here
and get rough.

29:27.302 --> 29:29.532
Nobody comes into my place
and threatens me.

29:29.604 --> 29:31.902
Just telling you
the facts, pal.

29:32.641 --> 29:34.165
Okay, let's go.

29:36.444 --> 29:38.002
[cymbal crashes]
Whoa!

29:55.530 --> 29:58.761
How. Oh, great wooden face!

29:58.833 --> 30:02.769
Your braves, led by
Almighty Troubled Warrior
Running Round...

30:02.837 --> 30:04.668
scored a big victory today...

30:04.739 --> 30:08.072
against pug face
who talk with forked tongue.

30:08.143 --> 30:10.873
Maybe we even get
a picture in newspaper.

30:11.446 --> 30:12.845
Hey, man,
who are you talking to?

30:12.914 --> 30:14.472
lt's just a piece of wood!

30:14.549 --> 30:15.743
[laughs]

30:15.817 --> 30:18.752
Piece of wood.
No, a telephone pole
is a piece of wood...

30:18.820 --> 30:22.017
a toothpick is a piece
of wood, but this, B. A....

30:22.724 --> 30:25.522
This is a priceless
work of art.

30:25.827 --> 30:28.819
lt is the essence,
the manifestation
of a great chief.

30:28.897 --> 30:31.525
A hunter, a poet, a warrior.

30:32.133 --> 30:35.296
This is the face
that launched
a thousand nickels.

30:45.347 --> 30:47.645
Now, this is definitely
going to hurt.

30:47.716 --> 30:50.446
Did you have to use
the word ''definitely''?

30:50.518 --> 30:54.579
Relax. l've been mending
skinned knees and broken
bones and sore hooves...

30:54.656 --> 30:55.987
since l can remember.

30:56.057 --> 30:57.684
Hooves? Like in horses?

30:57.759 --> 30:59.317
Now, this is going
to sting for a second.

31:00.161 --> 31:01.389
[groaning]

31:01.463 --> 31:04.091
l really appreciate
what you did today.

31:04.899 --> 31:06.799
You know,
you could have been killed.

31:06.868 --> 31:08.096
l know.

31:08.837 --> 31:11.897
Well, we're just soldiers
doing a job.

31:12.440 --> 31:14.408
Helping out people like us?

31:14.476 --> 31:16.000
Those in need.

31:17.212 --> 31:20.375
(Hannibal)
l hope we're not
interrupting anything.

31:21.282 --> 31:22.977
You couldn't come by
two minutes ago...

31:23.051 --> 31:25.076
when she was putting
horse liniment on my face?

31:25.153 --> 31:27.348
Horse liniment?
Figures.

31:28.390 --> 31:30.585
l ran a little background
on our friend Mason.

31:30.659 --> 31:31.648
lnteresting.

31:31.726 --> 31:35.662
Two arrests for smuggling
drugs into the country,
but no convictions.

31:35.730 --> 31:37.891
l knew the minute l laid eyes
on that cahoot...

31:37.966 --> 31:40.196
he was walking
on the wrong side of the law.

31:40.268 --> 31:42.293
What does drug smuggling
have to do
with a Wild West show?

31:42.904 --> 31:47.500
Captain, you said that Mason
didn't make any offer
for your Wild West show...

31:47.575 --> 31:50.066
until after you had booked
your European tour, right?

31:50.145 --> 31:51.077
That's right.

31:51.146 --> 31:52.340
What better cover...

31:52.414 --> 31:54.473
for an overseas
smuggling operation...

31:54.549 --> 31:57.313
than a traveling
Wild West show?

31:57.385 --> 31:58.977
Mason wasn't
scared off?

31:59.054 --> 32:00.112
No.

32:00.588 --> 32:02.818
He wants this show.
lf he can't get it...

32:02.891 --> 32:04.518
he'll do anything
to stop you...

32:04.592 --> 32:06.184
from playing overseas
in Europe.

32:06.261 --> 32:10.527
That way, he can book
one of his rock groups
into your open play dates.

32:10.732 --> 32:12.632
Either way he wins.
He tries.

32:12.701 --> 32:14.328
We can expect
something dangerous...

32:14.402 --> 32:16.097
from him, most any time now.

32:16.171 --> 32:17.900
You have a plan, Colonel?
Well, kind of.

32:18.973 --> 32:20.133
B.A.!

32:21.509 --> 32:23.875
(Hannibal)
Captain, l went through
your personnel records...

32:23.945 --> 32:25.037
and guess who...

32:25.113 --> 32:29.311
was the only man hired
after lvy's column
appeared in the paper?

32:29.384 --> 32:31.716
Our friend here.
You mean he's a spy?

32:31.786 --> 32:32.775
Mmm-hmm.

32:32.854 --> 32:35.584
Sergeant Wilson,
United States
Army lntelligence.

32:35.657 --> 32:38.524
We went through your wallet
last night
when you were sleeping, sonny.

32:38.593 --> 32:39.958
[ululating]

32:41.029 --> 32:44.055
Me, big happy brave!
Me get scalp today!

32:44.265 --> 32:46.199
Cool it, man.
He's my prisoner.

32:46.267 --> 32:48.258
You'll never
get out of here, Smith.

32:48.336 --> 32:49.963
None of you will.

32:51.172 --> 32:53.140
Really? Bring him along.

32:56.111 --> 32:58.079
Col. Lynch, it's Wilson.

32:58.713 --> 33:01.238
l overheard Peck
and Baracus talking.

33:01.316 --> 33:04.513
They're expecting Smith
to show up at 1 400 hours.

33:04.786 --> 33:06.083
Good work, Sergeant.

33:06.154 --> 33:07.678
We'll rendezvous
at your position...

33:07.756 --> 33:10.350
at 1 400 hours
and grab Smith and the others.

33:10.425 --> 33:12.120
Maintain your surveillance.

33:12.193 --> 33:13.455
Yes, sir.

33:14.562 --> 33:15.790
Captain!

33:20.502 --> 33:23.835
Alert our positions
to move in on the A-Team
according to plan...

33:23.905 --> 33:25.395
on my command.

33:26.441 --> 33:30.502
l want that camp sealed off
tighter than an air chamber
when we move in, Captain.

33:30.578 --> 33:31.840
Yes, sir.

33:35.450 --> 33:38.749
1 400 hours, Hannibal.
That doesn't give us
much time.

33:38.953 --> 33:43.447
lt gives us plenty of time
to make up a welcome
for Mason and his gorillas.

35:11.913 --> 35:12.880
[hissing]

35:52.253 --> 35:54.244
All right, we're going
to hit Winnetka's camp.

35:54.322 --> 35:55.448
We're going
to hit it hard.

35:55.523 --> 35:56.888
l want
the A-Team taken out.

35:56.958 --> 35:58.789
When we leave that place
the only thing...

35:58.860 --> 36:01.886
l want to see standing
are tent posts. Got it?

36:07.135 --> 36:08.124
[engine starting]

36:12.640 --> 36:15.803
Boy, Hannibal,
l hope you got this timed
right down to the last second.

36:15.877 --> 36:17.902
'Cause if you don't,
we're going to get caught...

36:17.979 --> 36:20.447
right between
Col. Lynch and Mason.

36:20.748 --> 36:21.908
Right.

36:22.583 --> 36:23.948
All right.

36:36.297 --> 36:38.663
Hannibal!
Mason's on his way.

36:38.733 --> 36:40.257
Maybe five minutes
behind us.

36:40.335 --> 36:41.825
Okay,
take your positions.

36:41.903 --> 36:43.962
We got to take care
of him
before Lynch gets here.

36:45.039 --> 36:46.631
Just like
an old-fashioned showdown.

36:46.708 --> 36:48.300
[sirens blaring]

36:53.781 --> 36:55.305
ls that Lynch?
Lynch?

36:55.383 --> 36:56.850
See. He's early.

36:56.918 --> 36:58.442
Oh, wonderful.

36:58.886 --> 37:01.320
All right,
everybody into the tent.

37:22.243 --> 37:24.677
Smith!
(Hannibal)
Welcome back, Lynch.

37:24.746 --> 37:26.714
We've finally got you now.
Come on out.

37:26.781 --> 37:28.544
Okay, here we come.

37:30.752 --> 37:32.117
After them!

37:36.624 --> 37:38.285
[tires screeching]

37:43.798 --> 37:45.789
This is better
than we planned.

37:45.867 --> 37:49.200
Looks like the military
is going to take out
the A-Team for us.

37:49.270 --> 37:51.898
Winnetka's camp is wide open.

37:51.973 --> 37:54.271
Let's go down
and take it apart.

37:56.310 --> 37:57.800
[siren wailing]

38:03.017 --> 38:05.815
All right, the van's
on its way. l'm in pursuit.

38:05.887 --> 38:08.117
Trap unit, prepare for action.

38:30.845 --> 38:32.938
Unit three, fall in behind.

39:14.856 --> 39:17.950
We have them, sir!
The plan worked perfectly!

39:18.259 --> 39:20.853
We have the A-Team
locked in the truck.

39:20.928 --> 39:23.453
No one else could do it,
Captain. But l did.

39:25.233 --> 39:27.929
l want this truck driven
to the nearest army base...

39:28.002 --> 39:30.698
under the tightest
of security, Captain.

39:44.719 --> 39:47.187
When we get through here,
the only thing...

39:47.255 --> 39:50.224
Winnetka's going to be
able to peddle is ash.

39:53.327 --> 39:56.694
lf you fellows are figuring
on roasting marshmallows,
l wouldn't.

39:56.764 --> 39:57.731
You'd get burned.

39:57.798 --> 39:59.060
l thought the army had you.

39:59.467 --> 40:00.456
Yeah, so did they.

40:00.535 --> 40:01.627
(Mason)
Take him!

40:01.736 --> 40:03.101
[gun firing]

40:03.905 --> 40:06.203
Go on!
He's in there somewhere!

40:18.352 --> 40:19.876
[gun firing]

40:19.954 --> 40:22.479
Big warrior say
here hot tip for you.

40:31.032 --> 40:32.795
Here second hot tip.

41:13.274 --> 41:14.605
[groaning]

41:24.418 --> 41:25.817
[bell rings]

41:26.587 --> 41:27.554
Ding dong.

41:30.591 --> 41:31.990
You're looking for me?

41:43.337 --> 41:44.827
Remind me to write to lvy.

41:44.905 --> 41:47.396
Get him to print a retraction
in his column.

41:47.475 --> 41:49.773
l think it's time
the true story was told.
Don't you?

41:49.844 --> 41:51.903
You just make sure
he spells my name right.

41:51.979 --> 41:54.675
Oh, man, cool it!
Cool it? lt's easy
for you to say, that...

41:54.749 --> 41:58.310
because everybody knows
who you are, but--
Ah, ah, ah. Now.

41:59.253 --> 42:00.982
You must remain
our secret weapon.

42:01.055 --> 42:02.545
l don't want
to be a secret weapon.

42:02.623 --> 42:04.113
l want to be
an exposed weapon.

42:04.191 --> 42:05.658
Yes, but listen...

42:05.726 --> 42:07.887
who was
the last male astronaut
to go up in space?

42:07.962 --> 42:08.929
l don't know.

42:08.996 --> 42:10.486
See?
l mean,
there was Sally Ride--

42:10.564 --> 42:11.997
No, that's a girl.
She is, l know.

42:12.066 --> 42:14.057
All right, now,
who is the Unknown
Soldier?

42:14.135 --> 42:15.466
l don't know.
See?

42:15.536 --> 42:19.063
What?
There are great,
famous...

42:19.140 --> 42:21.404
but unknown heroes
in life.

42:21.475 --> 42:24.273
l see. So,
l can be a great....
Famous.

42:24.345 --> 42:27.610
Famous, but unknown
member of the A-Team.

42:27.682 --> 42:28.910
Exactly.

42:39.560 --> 42:40.993
Good work,
Col. Lynch.

42:41.062 --> 42:43.724
Trapping the A-Team.
You pulled it off.

42:44.231 --> 42:46.699
l don't have to tell you
what this could mean
to your career.

42:47.635 --> 42:50.297
They were good, sir.
But the outcome
was inevitable.

42:50.371 --> 42:54.330
No one, not even the A-Team,
can escape capture
indefinitely.

42:55.710 --> 42:58.042
This is Col. Lynch.
You're surrounded, Smith.

42:58.112 --> 43:02.515
l want you to come out
of that van with your hands up
or we will open fire.

43:02.583 --> 43:04.710
You have exactly
10 seconds.

43:05.953 --> 43:07.443
[guns cocking]

43:11.258 --> 43:12.418
Howdy!

43:16.897 --> 43:18.626
l don't understand.

43:18.899 --> 43:20.389
The A-Team?

43:26.107 --> 43:28.371
lt's empty, Colonel.
Completely.

43:28.442 --> 43:29.431
Royce, arrest them.

43:29.510 --> 43:32.968
For what, Colonel?
lmpersonating the A-Team?

43:33.814 --> 43:35.975
l want these two
escorted off the base.

43:36.050 --> 43:37.813
Take the van
to the warehouse
and lock it up.

43:41.222 --> 43:42.746
[clears throat]

43:44.725 --> 43:46.955
l don't know what
this is all about,
Col. Lynch...

43:47.027 --> 43:49.655
but l don't find it
very funny. You told me
you had the A-Team.

43:49.730 --> 43:53.791
l don't understand.
General, it was a set up.

43:54.034 --> 43:57.231
l want a full report
of this incident on my desk...

43:57.304 --> 44:00.000
and l want it
10 minutes ago.

44:00.608 --> 44:01.632
Sir.

44:10.317 --> 44:12.785
The van. lt's them!
Stop that van!

44:17.458 --> 44:18.857
[gun firing]

44:20.895 --> 44:22.260
[ululating]

44:26.834 --> 44:27.926
l don't believe it.

44:28.002 --> 44:30.562
l love it
when a plan comes together.
