WEBVTT

00:03.929 --> 00:05.495
DENNIS:<i> All right, so there</i>
<i> we were. We're in the brig</i>

00:05.497 --> 00:06.563
<i> and the whole ship just,</i>
<i> you know, bumps.</i>

00:06.565 --> 00:08.098
We get
thrown against the wall.

00:08.100 --> 00:09.666
Yeah.
You know,
the-the lights are going off.

00:09.668 --> 00:11.468
The sirens are blaring.
Whoa, whoa.

00:11.470 --> 00:13.003
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:13.005 --> 00:14.771
How did we get in the
brig in the first place?

00:14.773 --> 00:16.139
What do you mean, Frank?
You were there.

00:16.141 --> 00:17.674
I'm very cloudy
about the beginning.

00:17.676 --> 00:19.076
I think I need a recap.

00:19.078 --> 00:20.911
Recap?
A recap would be good, you know?

00:20.913 --> 00:22.479
Just to kind of brush up
on everything that happened.

00:22.481 --> 00:23.981
A recap...
Now, see, I forgot that.

00:23.983 --> 00:25.449
...honestly might be good
because, you know,

00:25.451 --> 00:26.583
we want him
to be completely clear

00:26.585 --> 00:27.751
before the final judgment.

00:27.753 --> 00:29.252
All right, you know,
Right, yeah.

00:29.254 --> 00:30.487
the amount of energy
we're using talking

00:30.489 --> 00:31.788
about whether
or not we should recap,

00:31.790 --> 00:33.323
we may as well just recap,
so fine, fine.

00:33.325 --> 00:34.825
So there we were.
We're on a Christian cruise.

00:34.827 --> 00:35.993
Yeah, we were all thrown
in the brig

00:35.995 --> 00:37.361
for various sins
that we committed.

00:37.363 --> 00:39.363
Me, admittedly,
for a little bit of lust.

00:39.365 --> 00:40.831
Um, and in summation,
we're all good people,

00:40.833 --> 00:41.999
asking for forgiveness,

00:42.001 --> 00:43.266
My thing, not a rape.

00:43.268 --> 00:44.935
Move on; you're
losing him.

00:44.937 --> 00:46.336
Move on; you're losing him.
I just want to be clear.

00:46.338 --> 00:47.604
Okay, yeah, yeah.
I just wanted to be clear.

01:11.497 --> 01:12.496
(alarm blaring)

01:12.498 --> 01:14.364
(thunder crashes)

01:14.366 --> 01:15.732
What the hell is that?

01:15.734 --> 01:16.733
What're those sirens for?

01:16.735 --> 01:18.869
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

01:18.871 --> 01:21.038
See, I knew I shouldn't
have come on this cruise.

01:21.040 --> 01:24.174
I knew it! I mean, it used to be
I would never even leave Philly!

01:24.176 --> 01:25.876
And then, you know,
you guys drag me into this,

01:25.878 --> 01:28.178
you drag me into that,
and next thing I know,

01:28.180 --> 01:31.081
I-I'm stuck in a box
on a sinking ship!

01:31.083 --> 01:33.083
Hold on, the boat's not sinking.
How do you know that?

01:33.085 --> 01:34.184
How do you know it's not...?

01:34.186 --> 01:35.185
(alarm stops)

01:35.187 --> 01:36.653
Well... Oh.

01:36.655 --> 01:38.221
There you go. It stopped.

01:38.223 --> 01:40.057
All right, uh,
I guess that's good.

01:40.059 --> 01:42.426
I mean, like...
like, if something went wrong,

01:42.428 --> 01:44.661
they-they'd come down here,
they'd get us, right?

01:44.663 --> 01:46.029
You know what, guys,
what difference does it make?

01:46.031 --> 01:47.164
You know?

01:47.166 --> 01:48.765
Life is just a series of events

01:48.767 --> 01:51.401
with no meaning or plan,
you know?

01:51.403 --> 01:53.170
It's like, we live, we die,

01:53.172 --> 01:56.573
we're gay, we're straight,
we're tops, we're bottoms.

01:56.575 --> 01:58.542
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Calm down, everybody.

01:58.544 --> 02:00.944
We're gonna be
in the Bahamas in an hour.

02:00.946 --> 02:03.780
Well, you sure? Like, I...
I don't think we're moving.

02:03.782 --> 02:06.716
We're moving. I can hear
the engine buzzing like crazy.

02:06.718 --> 02:08.718
No, I think Charlie's right.

02:08.720 --> 02:11.021
I-I don't think that we're
moving, and-and besides,

02:11.023 --> 02:13.356
the buzzing would be,
like, an electrical system.

02:13.358 --> 02:15.358
You know?
The engine sounds more like...

02:15.360 --> 02:17.461
(imitating a motor boat)

02:17.463 --> 02:19.196
Yeah, maybe on a speedboat.
This is a big cruise ship.

02:19.198 --> 02:21.398
It's got like a big,
deep sound; it's like a...

02:21.400 --> 02:24.901
(imitating engine starting)

02:24.903 --> 02:26.269
Yeah, if you're starting
the engine, but, like,

02:26.271 --> 02:28.071
we would be hearing a steady...

02:28.073 --> 02:29.706
Gah, gah, gah, gah,
gah, gah, gah, gah...

02:29.708 --> 02:31.141
DENNIS: No, you
guys are all wrong.

02:31.143 --> 02:33.410
No, boats are mostly
computerized these days,

02:33.412 --> 02:35.145
so the engine barely
makes any noise at all.

02:35.147 --> 02:37.214
I mean, they-they make
a fake noise

02:37.216 --> 02:40.283
to-to make people feel better,
but it's like... (deep humming)

02:40.285 --> 02:42.219
But it's fake, it's not...
it's not real, you know?

02:42.221 --> 02:44.054
It's kind of like how I carry
a little piece of onion

02:44.056 --> 02:45.722
around with me to elicit tears,
you know,

02:45.724 --> 02:47.457
in case someone needs me
to feel something

02:47.459 --> 02:49.759
about what they said or
are doing, you know what I mean?

02:49.761 --> 02:52.596
Do you have an onion
in your pocket right now?
No.

02:52.598 --> 02:55.265
No, I'm taking
a vacation from myself.

02:55.267 --> 02:57.134
W-Was it a vacation
from hearing, okay?

02:57.136 --> 02:59.636
'Cause if the engine was going,
we would hear a gah, gah, gah,

02:59.638 --> 03:01.638
gah, gah, gah, gah...
Are you deaf, Charlie?

03:01.640 --> 03:04.608
I was like...
(imitating motor boat)

03:04.610 --> 03:08.545
(all doing different
engine imitations)

03:14.186 --> 03:16.086
All right, okay, all right!
I mean, that's ridiculous!

03:16.088 --> 03:17.320
All right, all right, all right!

03:17.322 --> 03:19.189
Goddamn! Okay, look.

03:19.191 --> 03:20.991
Let's just, let's all agree

03:20.993 --> 03:22.626
that it doesn't sound
like a speedboat

03:22.628 --> 03:23.960
or something
that's off-roading, all right?

03:23.962 --> 03:25.595
It does make a little
bit of a buzz.

03:25.597 --> 03:27.164
Yeah?

03:27.166 --> 03:28.532
But most modern ships
these days, their engines,

03:28.534 --> 03:29.933
they don't make a lot of noise,

03:29.935 --> 03:31.168
but they do make
a little bit of noise.

03:31.170 --> 03:32.769
Can we all just
agree on this?

03:32.771 --> 03:34.604
Yeah.
DEE: Fine.
Fine, I can live with that.

03:34.606 --> 03:35.672
Fine, I can live with it.
Fine.

03:35.674 --> 03:37.641
Okay, all right.
(groans)

03:37.643 --> 03:38.842
How long have we been
talking about this?

03:38.844 --> 03:41.645
Four hours, six minutes.

03:41.647 --> 03:43.280
(Frank whistles, groans)

03:43.282 --> 03:46.349
Well, there's some pros
and some cons, guys.

03:46.351 --> 03:49.486
Pro: We've cut our conflict
resolution time in half.

03:49.488 --> 03:51.555
Four hours, that's good for us.

03:51.557 --> 03:53.390
That's-that's huge,
that's huge.
Good work.

03:53.392 --> 03:56.293
Con: Charlie's right,
the ship is probably not moving

03:56.295 --> 03:58.895
because we definitely would've
been in the Bahamas by now.

03:58.897 --> 04:00.297
What?

04:00.299 --> 04:02.465
Yep.
Oh.

04:02.467 --> 04:04.401
Well, that's not good, right?
I mean...

04:04.403 --> 04:05.569
No. It's not good.

04:05.571 --> 04:08.138
I mean, f-four hours?

04:08.140 --> 04:09.639
Well...
The-the boat not moving!

04:09.641 --> 04:11.474
No one comes down
to say anything like,

04:11.476 --> 04:13.343
"Hey, guys, there's something
wrong with the ship!"

04:13.345 --> 04:15.879
No, they've forgotten about us!

04:15.881 --> 04:17.847
And we're gonna die in here!
Oh, my God, I'm freaking out.

04:17.849 --> 04:19.549
We got to get out
of here. Help!
Whoa, whoa, Charlie, Charlie.

04:19.551 --> 04:20.550
Calm down, Charlie.
Help!

04:20.552 --> 04:21.918
Help us!
Charlie!

04:21.920 --> 04:23.520
You got to help!
Hey! Hey!

04:23.522 --> 04:26.056
Oi, oi, oi, oi,
oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi!

04:26.058 --> 04:27.991
Mm, yep, yep, yep. Mm.

04:27.993 --> 04:29.226
Wow.
Yeah?

04:29.228 --> 04:30.393
Yep.
Oi, oi, oi.

04:30.395 --> 04:31.661
What-what was that, dude?

04:31.663 --> 04:33.330
You sound like
a soccer hooligan.

04:33.332 --> 04:34.898
Uh, yeah, that's just something
I've been doing

04:34.900 --> 04:36.366
with Charlie lately
when he gets a little wound up.

04:36.368 --> 04:37.901
You know, it seems to work.

04:37.903 --> 04:39.536
Say yup, yup, yup.
FRANK:
Oh, that's good.

04:39.538 --> 04:41.238
The most important thing
for us to do now

04:41.240 --> 04:42.839
is to keep our wits together.

04:42.841 --> 04:44.207
We got to occupy ourselves.
Mm-hmm.

04:44.209 --> 04:46.576
Why don't we play a few games?

04:46.578 --> 04:48.378
No, no! I just wanted to
get away from you guys,

04:48.380 --> 04:50.046
just for a few days.

04:50.048 --> 04:51.514
Now we're stuck in a box,

04:51.516 --> 04:52.849
and you're gonna play
some games now?

04:52.851 --> 04:55.518
You know what? I'm out.

04:55.520 --> 04:56.886
What?

04:56.888 --> 04:58.355
What the hell
do you mean you're out?

04:58.357 --> 05:00.724
I'm out.
Nobody talk to me.
MAC:
No, Dee.

05:00.726 --> 05:02.125
That's not a very good idea.

05:02.127 --> 05:03.893
You know, when my dad was
in solitary confinement,

05:03.895 --> 05:06.563
I used to write to him
every day to see how it was.

05:06.565 --> 05:09.099
He never wrote back, but if
he did, he would've said,

05:09.101 --> 05:11.635
"Son, you've got to keep
your mind active.

05:11.637 --> 05:13.703
Also, I love you."

05:13.705 --> 05:15.105
DENNIS: Uh, are you
sure he wouldn't say,

05:15.107 --> 05:18.108
"Remind me who
you are again"?

05:18.110 --> 05:20.210
Ho!
(laughing)

05:20.212 --> 05:22.078
That was great!
That was Luther!

05:22.080 --> 05:23.880
My-my-my dad
knows who I am.
Yeah-yeah.

05:23.882 --> 05:25.382
Hey-hey, do the voice
again, but this time say,

05:25.384 --> 05:26.883
"I love you, son."
Nah.

05:26.885 --> 05:28.285
Oh.
But, no, that's

05:28.287 --> 05:30.487
a good distraction,
like, um, you know,

05:30.489 --> 05:32.622
like any kind of impressions
you got, like any kind of...

05:32.624 --> 05:34.157
You want to hear me do
a couple of impressions?

05:34.159 --> 05:35.725
That'd be fun. Yeah,
okay, so let's see.

05:35.727 --> 05:37.494
All right, so let me know
which ones you want to hear.

05:37.496 --> 05:39.796
I'm sorry, Dee, I thought
you were sitting out.

05:39.798 --> 05:41.965
Well, I was out, but then
these guys wanted to hear

05:41.967 --> 05:44.301
some impressions, and since I'm
always wanting to be of service,

05:44.303 --> 05:46.603
here I am, uh...
They don't want to
hear your impressions.

05:46.605 --> 05:47.804
They want to hear
my impressions.
No.

05:47.806 --> 05:48.905
Your impressions
are terrible.

05:48.907 --> 05:50.607
Are you out of your mind?
No.

05:50.609 --> 05:52.008
My impressions are fantastic.

05:52.010 --> 05:54.110
Give me somebody.
Anybody.

05:54.112 --> 05:55.612
Do Obama.

05:55.614 --> 05:57.580
Obama?
Well, I can't do that.

05:57.582 --> 05:59.249
Why not?
Yeah.
DENNIS: Why can't you do Obama?

05:59.251 --> 06:01.017
'Cause he's a black man
and I'm a white woman.

06:01.019 --> 06:02.452
Can you give me a white woman?

06:02.454 --> 06:04.321
You think I can't
do a black woman?

06:04.323 --> 06:05.322
(laughs):
I mean...

06:05.324 --> 06:06.356
No.

06:06.358 --> 06:08.124
I... okay, give me, name one.

06:08.126 --> 06:11.094
C.C.H. Pounder.

06:11.096 --> 06:12.796
Who's that?
C.C.H. Poun...

06:12.798 --> 06:14.297
Yeah. The actress
from<i> The Shield.</i>

06:14.299 --> 06:15.365
Love that show.
Okay, yeah.

06:15.367 --> 06:16.433
No, I can do that.
Yeah.

06:16.435 --> 06:18.668
Let's see.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.437
(imitating C.C.H. Pounder):
Goddamn it, Dutch!

06:20.439 --> 06:23.807
What other errands do you
have us running for the D.A.?

06:23.809 --> 06:25.375
BOTH: Wow!
FRANK:
Holy shit!

06:25.377 --> 06:27.344
That was great!

06:27.346 --> 06:28.378
That was spot-on!

06:28.380 --> 06:29.679
Thanks, man.
"Spot-on"?

06:29.681 --> 06:31.448
You don't even know
who she is, Frank.

06:31.450 --> 06:33.283
I just assumed
she's a no-nonsense

06:33.285 --> 06:35.618
black broad from the precinct.

06:35.620 --> 06:37.020
DENNIS:
That's exactly who she is.
That's exactly who she is.

06:37.022 --> 06:38.321
(all clamoring)

06:38.323 --> 06:40.323
Fine, fine, fine.
I'll do Obama, okay?

06:40.325 --> 06:41.391
Okay.

06:41.393 --> 06:42.692
Okay, what do you got?

06:42.694 --> 06:44.160
Hey, yo, what up, son?

06:44.162 --> 06:45.495
What's up wit'
Congress bein' all

06:45.497 --> 06:46.696
up in my ass
and shit, brother?

06:46.698 --> 06:47.964
Oh!
Oh!

06:47.966 --> 06:49.199
Oh, my God, Dee.
FRANK: That is bad!

06:49.201 --> 06:50.333
What are you doing?

06:50.335 --> 06:51.668
That was<i> so</i> racist.

06:51.670 --> 06:54.037
Are you kidding me?!
CHARLIE:
Very racist!

06:54.039 --> 06:55.839
Deandra, he is the president
of the United States.

06:55.841 --> 06:57.207
That's our president.
DEE: Well, hold on a second.

06:57.209 --> 06:59.976
Why was that racist,
but what he did was fine?

06:59.978 --> 07:03.046
Because that's not what Obama
sounds like, Dee. That's why.

07:03.048 --> 07:06.549
Uh... okay, well, you know,
I-I'm just warming up.

07:06.551 --> 07:09.519
Let me, let me try again.
Um...

07:09.521 --> 07:12.021
Hey, yo,
where my senators at, dawg?

07:12.023 --> 07:13.089
Oh!
Oh!

07:13.091 --> 07:14.157
Oi, oi, oi, oi!

07:14.159 --> 07:15.291
Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi!

07:21.533 --> 07:23.199
Welcome to my first ever
dinner party.

07:23.201 --> 07:25.068
I'm gonna have lots
of these types of functions

07:25.070 --> 07:27.537
in the future, you know,
with my new lifestyle.
(chuckles)

07:27.539 --> 07:29.172
Wow, you're really just diving
right into that, huh?

07:29.174 --> 07:30.874
Just, stereotypes and all.

07:30.876 --> 07:33.443
Guys, we are gonna have
an imaginary meal.
Mmm.

07:33.445 --> 07:35.678
I read about this. Yes.

07:35.680 --> 07:38.281
If you truly believe it,
then it will make you full.
That's true.

07:38.283 --> 07:40.750
Okay.
Can I have a broad
with me with big tits?

07:40.752 --> 07:42.419
No, because that's
gonna force us

07:42.421 --> 07:44.020
to imagine things
that we don't want to imagine.

07:44.022 --> 07:45.355
Ah, good point.
So get rid of my dog?

07:45.357 --> 07:46.389
Yeah, no dogs.

07:46.391 --> 07:47.924
Go! Go!
Hey, get out of here!

07:47.926 --> 07:50.126
Don't kick it.
Get, get, get!
Kick it in the skull.

07:50.128 --> 07:51.628
We do not allow dogs
in our house, right, Dennis?

07:51.630 --> 07:53.029
Don't kick the dog.

07:53.031 --> 07:54.197
Wh...? Our house?
Wh-Why's it our house?

07:54.199 --> 07:55.432
Okay, let's get started.

07:55.434 --> 07:57.200
Let me... let me set
the scene: the food.

07:57.202 --> 07:59.235
The menu. Okay, all right.
Ooh, yeah, start with the...

07:59.237 --> 08:01.070
Yeah, yeah,
let's get to it.
Okay, all right, here we go.

08:01.072 --> 08:02.939
Paint a nice picture for us,
all right? I'm starving, man.

08:02.941 --> 08:04.240
All right, now
you're gonna start

08:04.242 --> 08:05.909
with, like, a big
hunk of chicken.

08:05.911 --> 08:08.978
You know, like, boiled and
skinless, or-or whatever.

08:08.980 --> 08:11.381
CHARLIE: Huh.
Ugh.
DENNIS: Okay.

08:11.383 --> 08:14.217
And then, um, you're gonna want
brown with the white, right?

08:14.219 --> 08:17.454
So, like, maybe, like, um,
some, like, brown rice.

08:17.456 --> 08:18.822
No... no butter

08:18.824 --> 08:20.490
or-or seasoning or...

08:20.492 --> 08:21.491
Really?

08:21.493 --> 08:23.226
I want mashed potatoes.

08:23.228 --> 08:24.627
No, no mashed potatoes;
that's just empty carbs.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.062
Why can't we just imagine
whatever we want?

08:26.064 --> 08:27.464
Because this is
my dinner party.

08:27.466 --> 08:29.265
Well, then take us there!
Yeah!

08:29.267 --> 08:30.600
All right! All right, okay.

08:30.602 --> 08:31.601
Everybody's got
something to drink.

08:31.603 --> 08:32.602
Is it a milkshake?

08:32.604 --> 08:33.603
No!

08:33.605 --> 08:35.071
No, not milkshakes.

08:35.073 --> 08:36.573
Gatorade.

08:36.575 --> 08:37.807
And it's gonna be

08:37.809 --> 08:39.442
my favorite flavor: blue.

08:39.444 --> 08:41.444
"Blue" is not a flavor.

08:41.446 --> 08:43.346
How am I gonna taste blue?

08:43.348 --> 08:45.615
Well, just imagine
what blue tastes like.

08:45.617 --> 08:46.950
It does... It just
tastes like blue.

08:46.952 --> 08:48.184
Let's just dig in.
Yeah, can we eat?

08:48.186 --> 08:49.185
CHARLIE:
Yeah, can we eat?

08:49.187 --> 08:50.186
All right.
Yes.

08:50.188 --> 08:51.855
♪ ♪

08:51.857 --> 08:54.357
FRANK:
All right.

08:54.359 --> 08:57.193
Mine's kind of tough.

08:57.195 --> 08:58.428
D-Did you overcook this?

08:58.430 --> 09:00.029
No, I didn't
cook it at all.

09:00.031 --> 09:01.531
Y-You... (spits)

09:01.533 --> 09:03.533
Spit it out! It's raw!
You're gonna get sick!

09:03.535 --> 09:05.168
Spit it out, man,
spit it out!
No, no, don't spit it out!

09:05.170 --> 09:07.370
What are you guys doing?
You don't need to spit it out.

09:07.372 --> 09:08.872
For the love of God.

09:08.874 --> 09:10.173
Look, just imagine
that it tastes good, okay?

09:10.175 --> 09:11.641
Look at Dennis, see?

09:11.643 --> 09:14.043
Oh, I'm not...
I'm not imagining your meal.

09:14.045 --> 09:17.046
No, I'm imagining
a lovely coq au vin.

09:17.048 --> 09:19.349
Braised with lardons
and mushrooms.

09:19.351 --> 09:20.850
I want that!
Yeah.

09:20.852 --> 09:22.452
Well, then have it--
it's right in front of you.

09:22.454 --> 09:23.720
As is your buxom date, Frank.

09:23.722 --> 09:25.154
Ah, come here, baby.

09:25.156 --> 09:26.523
Oh, hey!

09:26.525 --> 09:28.658
She got her foot
in my raw chicken!

09:28.660 --> 09:30.627
Get your hooker's foot
out of my chicken, man!
No, no, no, no.

09:30.629 --> 09:32.328
No dates, no coq au vin,
no hookers.
Get it out of my chicken!

09:32.330 --> 09:34.030
Stop ruining this!
I'm not ruining it.

09:34.032 --> 09:35.698
(imitates buzzing)

09:35.700 --> 09:37.333
What the hell is that?!

09:37.335 --> 09:38.735
Oh, this? It's the sound

09:38.737 --> 09:40.169
of my blender
cranking milkshakes.

09:40.171 --> 09:42.572
Anybody want one?
(resumes buzzing)

09:42.574 --> 09:44.741
Shit, I'll take
a milkshake. Yeah.
I'll have a
milkshake-- that sounds good.

09:44.743 --> 09:47.010
FRANK: I'll take one.
That is not what
blenders sound like, Dee.

09:47.012 --> 09:48.645
No! Don't leave my table! Crash!

09:48.647 --> 09:50.079
Hey!
What are you doing?

09:50.081 --> 09:52.815
I'm flipping the table!
Smash! Crash!
Oh!

09:52.817 --> 09:55.084
Now I'm breaking a plate!
Boom! Smash!
Oh, man.

09:55.086 --> 09:56.853
DENNIS:
What the hell, dude?!

09:56.855 --> 09:58.221
Oh, that was really
uncalled for.
That's nice.

09:58.223 --> 09:59.656
Nothing is working,
all right?

09:59.658 --> 10:01.024
You know what,
I want you guys to just...

10:01.026 --> 10:02.492
Everybody just be quiet.

10:02.494 --> 10:04.260
Why don't we just try
not talking for a while?

10:04.262 --> 10:05.929
I'm fine with that.

10:05.931 --> 10:07.330
Yeah.

10:07.332 --> 10:09.432
Well, that'll be
the first time ever.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.806
(ship creaking)

10:27.018 --> 10:28.918
(coin clinks)

10:28.920 --> 10:30.086
(sniffs)

10:30.088 --> 10:31.287
(coin clinks)

10:31.289 --> 10:32.956
(grunts)
(groans)

10:32.958 --> 10:35.224
(coin clinks,
hands smack rhythmically)

10:35.226 --> 10:36.359
Shh!
Of course.

10:36.361 --> 10:38.394
(coin clinking,
hands smacking rhythmically)

10:38.396 --> 10:39.662
(Frank grunting to rhythm)

10:43.268 --> 10:44.367
Yeah.

10:44.369 --> 10:47.437
(rhythmic noises continue)

10:48.106 --> 10:49.872
Okay.

11:00.986 --> 11:02.452
MAC:
Okay.

11:03.989 --> 11:05.455
MAC:
Okay.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.793
ALL:
Ha!

11:10.795 --> 11:12.629
(chuckles)

11:14.399 --> 11:15.798
Well, that was lame.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.233
So stupid.
So stu...

11:17.235 --> 11:18.735
I hated that show,<i> Stomp.</i>

11:18.737 --> 11:20.336
Ugh, I hate rhythm.
H-H-Hang on. Hang on.

11:20.338 --> 11:21.638
D-Dee, what was that?

11:21.640 --> 11:23.272
Well, I-I thought
we were all doing,

11:23.274 --> 11:24.574
like, a<i> Stomp</i> thing
or something.

11:24.576 --> 11:25.975
That-that bench,
you opened that bench.

11:25.977 --> 11:27.410
What's inside there?
Oh.

11:27.412 --> 11:28.778
That opens?
Yes.

11:28.780 --> 11:29.979
Maybe there's
food in there.

11:29.981 --> 11:30.980
Is there food in there?

11:30.982 --> 11:32.181
Uh, no, just...

11:32.183 --> 11:33.850
Just this water gun.

11:33.852 --> 11:35.852
That's not a water gun,
man, that's a flare gun,

11:35.854 --> 11:37.286
which I'll hold onto
for safekeeping.

11:37.288 --> 11:39.155
Uh...

11:39.157 --> 11:41.024
Why?

11:41.026 --> 11:43.026
Well, because I'm the
most responsible person.

11:43.028 --> 11:45.294
Uh, guys, guys, I-I don't think
any of us should have a gun.

11:45.296 --> 11:46.295
Yeah.
Yeah.

11:46.297 --> 11:50.299
Well, one of us does, so...

11:50.301 --> 11:51.801
the end.

11:51.803 --> 11:53.670
Charlie, Charlie,
let me have the gun.

11:53.672 --> 11:55.505
Back up, Frank.
Don't come close to me.
Whoa, Cha...

11:55.507 --> 11:56.706
Charlie, calm down.

11:56.708 --> 11:58.007
"Calm down, Charlie"?

11:58.009 --> 12:00.677
We're trapped
on a sinking ship, okay?

12:00.679 --> 12:02.045
We're gonna die in here.

12:02.047 --> 12:03.713
I don't know what you guys
are capable of.

12:03.715 --> 12:05.715
I will hold the gun,
thank you very much.

12:05.717 --> 12:08.885
Wait a second, Charlie, the...
the boat's not sinking, okay?

12:08.887 --> 12:10.620
It's-it's just stopped.
Right. Right, it's okay.

12:10.622 --> 12:12.455
Everything's gonna
be all right

12:12.457 --> 12:13.890
as long as everybody
remains calm.

12:13.892 --> 12:16.059
What the hell is that?

12:16.061 --> 12:17.126
(loud rumbling)

12:23.334 --> 12:24.333
(groaning)
DEE: Oh, my God!

12:24.335 --> 12:25.702
What's going on?

12:25.704 --> 12:27.403
Wh-What was that?

12:28.807 --> 12:30.206
Oh, this is bad.

12:30.208 --> 12:31.207
This is really bad.

12:31.209 --> 12:32.241
All right.

12:32.243 --> 12:33.743
Let's think.

12:33.745 --> 12:35.578
If the room's on its side,

12:35.580 --> 12:37.980
does that mean the boat's
on its side? Or...

12:37.982 --> 12:40.216
Yeah, that's what it means!
What are you talking about?!

12:40.218 --> 12:42.251
I don't know how boats
this big work. All right.

12:42.253 --> 12:45.855
(all yelling for help)

12:45.857 --> 12:48.024
Help us!
This is bad!

12:48.026 --> 12:50.093
This is very bad!

12:50.095 --> 12:51.861
All right, we got to get up
there and try that door again.

12:51.863 --> 12:53.996
Maybe that lodged
something loose.

12:53.998 --> 12:55.932
Get up there? How are
we supposed to reach?

12:55.934 --> 12:57.767
Oh! What about
a human pyramid?

12:57.769 --> 12:59.769
Yes. Yes, Mac, a
human pyramid.

12:59.771 --> 13:01.270
All right, you and I
will be the bottoms.

13:01.272 --> 13:02.872
Why? 'Cause I'm gay?

13:02.874 --> 13:05.274
(sighs) No, not because
you're gay, dumb-ass!

13:05.276 --> 13:07.076
Because we're the strongest.

13:07.078 --> 13:08.845
Goddamn it.
All right, and,
Frank, Charlie,

13:08.847 --> 13:10.179
you'll be on us.

13:10.181 --> 13:11.581
And, Dee, you'll be
on the very top.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.282
DEE: Okay.
Okay, I'll be a bottom now,

13:13.284 --> 13:15.284
but in real life, just to
be clear, I'm gonna be a top.

13:15.286 --> 13:18.287
Okay, fine, when you're having
gay sex, you can be on the top.

13:18.289 --> 13:19.889
But for now we're
on the bottom.

13:19.891 --> 13:22.125
Damn it, the
door is locked!

13:22.127 --> 13:24.293
We're done for! We're
gonna die in here!
DENNIS:
Hey, Frank.

13:24.295 --> 13:25.795
Frank, get yourself together!
We're gonna
die in here!

13:25.797 --> 13:28.131
Stop losing your shit!
All right, relax!

13:28.133 --> 13:29.766
Nobody's dying!
DEE: That's right.

13:29.768 --> 13:31.100
Just listen to Charlie;
he seems to have

13:31.102 --> 13:32.268
his head straight.
Calm down.

13:32.270 --> 13:34.036
'Cause we're already dead.

13:34.038 --> 13:35.938
Come again?

13:35.940 --> 13:38.241
I figured it out.

13:38.243 --> 13:40.376
We're dead. We died.

13:40.378 --> 13:42.211
And I don't know
when it happened.

13:42.213 --> 13:44.213
It might have... might have
happened on the cruise ship.

13:44.215 --> 13:46.048
It might have happened on
the drive to the cruise ship.

13:46.050 --> 13:47.583
You were going
awful fast, Dennis.

13:47.585 --> 13:49.585
(ship creaking)
I don't know.

13:49.587 --> 13:51.420
Maybe it happened
weeks ago in the bar,

13:51.422 --> 13:54.257
in some sort of colossal and
awesome event, I would imagine,

13:54.259 --> 13:55.925
but we're dead,
and we're in hell.

13:55.927 --> 13:57.426
We're just being
toyed with here.

13:57.428 --> 13:59.929
Or-or m-maybe we're not
in hell yet.

13:59.931 --> 14:01.931
You know,
maybe this is purgatory,

14:01.933 --> 14:03.933
and we're on our way
to be judged.

14:03.935 --> 14:04.934
And soon, oh, boy.

14:04.936 --> 14:06.936
(chuckles)

14:06.938 --> 14:08.771
Yeah, soon,
we'll really be in hell.

14:08.773 --> 14:10.740
Won't that be something.

14:10.742 --> 14:12.742
Charlie, calm down.
It's-it's gonna be fine, okay?

14:12.744 --> 14:14.744
We can't be freaking out
every five minutes.

14:14.746 --> 14:18.981
Now, look, if we work together,
everything's gonna be fine.

14:18.983 --> 14:20.416
We're gonna get out of here.

14:20.418 --> 14:22.819
Nah, we're already dead.

14:22.821 --> 14:24.687
I'll prove it.
(gun cocks)

14:24.689 --> 14:26.756
(echoing):
No!

14:28.259 --> 14:30.092
(groans)

14:30.094 --> 14:31.928
I think he's coming to.

14:31.930 --> 14:33.663
CHARLIE:
Oh, shit, that hurt.

14:33.665 --> 14:35.498
FRANK: Oh, easy.
(Charlie groans)

14:35.500 --> 14:36.966
Well, I guess that
means we're alive, huh?

14:36.968 --> 14:38.801
Yeah, guess we are.
Guess we are, Charlie.

14:38.803 --> 14:40.670
Good, well, then maybe
everything's gonna be okay.

14:40.672 --> 14:43.673
Pal, we're in
deep shit here.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.274
Oh, shit!
Take it easy.
Okay, take it easy.

14:45.276 --> 14:46.509
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Take it easy.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.144
It's not good. It's not good.

14:48.146 --> 14:49.378
Oh.
DEE:
As long as, um,

14:49.380 --> 14:51.647
we're not gonna
get out of here--

14:51.649 --> 14:53.883
and it looks like that's
sort of where this is headed--

14:53.885 --> 14:55.618
is it okay if I just
confess something,

14:55.620 --> 14:58.221
get it off my chest
before we die?

14:58.223 --> 14:59.822
That's a good idea.

14:59.824 --> 15:01.324
We shouldn't die holding
things in about ourselves.

15:01.326 --> 15:02.625
Go ahead, Dee.

15:04.162 --> 15:05.394
Mac owns a Cowboys jersey.

15:05.396 --> 15:06.963
I saw him wearing it
in the back office.

15:06.965 --> 15:08.331
What?
Uh...
What?!

15:08.333 --> 15:09.899
That's a secret, Dee!
What are you...

15:09.901 --> 15:11.634
Don't say it's Romo.
Of course it's Romo!

15:11.636 --> 15:13.836
Who else would it be?
Oh, my God!

15:13.838 --> 15:15.171
(screaming)
MAC:
I'm sorry.

15:15.173 --> 15:16.739
You don't think
he deserves to be MVP?!

15:16.741 --> 15:18.074
You son of a bitch.
He's constantly overlooked!

15:18.076 --> 15:19.342
You are a traitor!

15:19.344 --> 15:20.343
How many Super Bowls
have the Birds won?

15:20.345 --> 15:21.344
Oh, shut up!

15:21.346 --> 15:23.646
Go Birds! (caws)

15:23.648 --> 15:25.081
Oi, oi, oi!
Okay, you know what?

15:25.083 --> 15:27.316
I've got something
I want to confess.

15:27.318 --> 15:29.385
Charlie changes Frank's
prescription on his glasses

15:29.387 --> 15:31.420
to keep Frank dependent on him.

15:31.422 --> 15:33.322
Whoa! Why the hell
you blowin' up my spot, man?!

15:33.324 --> 15:34.523
DENNIS: What?!
Uh, I'm sorry, Frank.

15:34.525 --> 15:35.825
All right, fine.

15:35.827 --> 15:37.159
Well, as long as
we're "tattling,"

15:37.161 --> 15:38.861
uh, Dennis ripped
up all the letters

15:38.863 --> 15:40.529
that your dad wrote
from prison,

15:40.531 --> 15:41.397
so... you know.
(chuckles)

15:41.399 --> 15:42.932
What?

15:42.934 --> 15:44.200
My dad has been writing?

15:44.202 --> 15:45.668
Dennis, is that true?

15:45.670 --> 15:47.069
Yeah, man, but you were
just gonna be, like,

15:47.071 --> 15:48.771
talking about it
all the time,

15:48.773 --> 15:50.206
and then your dad was probably
gonna come to our house

15:50.208 --> 15:52.208
and, like, try to kill
us or eat our butts.

15:52.210 --> 15:55.077
You know? I'm trying to
protect you, dude! And me.

15:56.114 --> 15:57.780
Does he still write?

15:57.782 --> 16:00.716
Well, no, pal, 'cause
you never wrote him back.

16:00.718 --> 16:02.618
(sighs)

16:02.620 --> 16:04.787
But, hey, if it makes
you feel any better,

16:04.789 --> 16:06.222
I-I read all
those letters,

16:06.224 --> 16:08.557
and he never once said
that he loved you.

16:08.559 --> 16:10.226
He just mostly wanted
you to send him,

16:10.228 --> 16:12.962
like, pornographic magazines
and put drugs in your butthole.

16:12.964 --> 16:14.697
(sighs)

16:14.699 --> 16:17.433
I can't believe this. I...

16:17.435 --> 16:20.069
I could've had
a relationship with my dad.

16:20.071 --> 16:21.304
But you ruined it.

16:21.306 --> 16:22.705
(scoffs)

16:22.707 --> 16:23.940
Normally, I would
attack you, but...

16:23.942 --> 16:26.676
I-I don't have any fight left.

16:33.418 --> 16:34.750
DENNIS:
Wow.

16:34.752 --> 16:35.985
Well, shit, man. I...

16:35.987 --> 16:39.588
I... I hurt ya.

16:39.590 --> 16:41.457
I can see that.

16:41.459 --> 16:42.892
And, uh...

16:42.894 --> 16:46.062
you know, it was... it was wrong
of me.

16:46.064 --> 16:48.798
Oh, God, I'll tell you...

16:48.800 --> 16:52.335
I see how much pain
you're in right now.

16:52.337 --> 16:54.136
It's just...

16:54.138 --> 16:55.404
(sniffles)

16:55.406 --> 16:56.973
...it's tearing me up inside.

16:56.975 --> 16:59.775
(sobbing)
Jesus, Dennis, you're crying.

16:59.777 --> 17:01.777
(crying):
Well, yeah.

17:01.779 --> 17:04.447
I mean, you've turned me
into a blubbering fool here,

17:04.449 --> 17:06.949
because I've hurt...

17:06.951 --> 17:08.651
not just my friend...

17:08.653 --> 17:11.420
(sobs)

17:11.422 --> 17:12.655
...but my brother.

17:12.657 --> 17:14.357
I've hurt my brother.

17:15.593 --> 17:18.094
Onion!
I just saw it!
Onion!

17:18.096 --> 17:19.328
He's got an
onion there!
Aw, I knew it!

17:19.330 --> 17:20.596
He's got an onion!

17:20.598 --> 17:22.131
You are such an asshole.
I...

17:22.133 --> 17:23.532
Now I gotta tell you!

17:23.534 --> 17:26.502
I got a confession.

17:26.504 --> 17:27.670
What is it, Frank?

17:27.672 --> 17:31.307
I was at Chappaquiddick.

17:31.309 --> 17:34.310
The girl, Teddy Kennedy,

17:34.312 --> 17:37.313
the bridge, the car...

17:37.315 --> 17:39.382
I played a major role.

17:39.384 --> 17:40.516
Jesus, Frank,
we're not doing confessions.

17:40.518 --> 17:42.151
We're doing tattling.
Keep up.

17:42.153 --> 17:43.319
DENNIS: You know what?
That's all right, it's okay.

17:43.321 --> 17:44.520
Guys, let's just...

17:44.522 --> 17:45.654
let's stop
fighting, okay?

17:45.656 --> 17:46.956
No more confessions,

17:46.958 --> 17:48.324
no more tattling
on each other, all right?

17:48.326 --> 17:49.325
Look, guys,

17:49.327 --> 17:50.793
let's just try to enjoy

17:50.795 --> 17:52.328
these last moments
we've got together.

17:52.330 --> 17:54.897
Okay? Or these last hours.

17:54.899 --> 17:58.934
Or, hell...
it could even be days.

18:02.507 --> 18:05.374
God, we're gonna drown.

18:05.376 --> 18:07.877
I'm too young
to drown!

18:07.879 --> 18:09.345
We should die
thinking good thoughts.

18:09.347 --> 18:10.913
Yeah.
For me,

18:10.915 --> 18:12.181
that's Romo connecting
with Dez Bryant.

18:12.183 --> 18:13.249
Oh, stop it!
You traitor!

18:13.251 --> 18:14.250
You son of a bitch!

18:14.252 --> 18:15.384
