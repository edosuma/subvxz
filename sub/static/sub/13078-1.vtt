00:11.977 --> 00:14.014
My head feels like a
gallon of water

00:14.048 --> 00:16.187
stuck in a soda can.

00:16.222 --> 00:18.397
Is it leaking out
of my eyes?

00:18.432 --> 00:20.813
-: Soda or water?
-: Soda.

00:20.848 --> 00:22.988
: Let me see.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.231
Nope. Just water.

00:25.508 --> 00:29.443
We should start before I
explode and drown us both.

00:30.823 --> 00:36.519
Hello. My name is Morgan.
And this is my true lover, Jordan.

00:36.553 --> 00:39.867
Wait, you have to explain what this is first
before you introduce another person.

00:39.901 --> 00:43.422
Haven't you ever made a
suicide video before?

00:43.457 --> 00:44.527
Fine.

00:44.561 --> 00:50.326
Uh, this is our digital
love letter to each other

00:50.360 --> 00:53.605
and our farewell video
to our family.

03:52.715 --> 03:54.958
No you don't.

03:54.993 --> 03:56.132
Tell me something
about yourself.

03:56.166 --> 03:57.858
Maybe next time.

03:57.892 --> 04:02.138
But I'll always remember this night kissing that very attractive boy girl.

04:02.172 --> 04:04.554
It's girl boy.

04:06.591 --> 04:08.696
Can I have your number?

04:08.731 --> 04:10.146
How about I get yours?

04:10.180 --> 04:12.355
I don't have a phone.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.255
Why don't you have a phone?

04:15.289 --> 04:17.774
Cause I don't have a phone.

04:17.809 --> 04:21.502
Just... give me your number

04:21.536 --> 04:23.677
But don't call me.

04:28.440 --> 04:31.029
Your arms look like my arms.

04:31.063 --> 04:32.651
Your eights looks like a nines.

04:32.686 --> 04:35.861
It is a nine.
My nines look like eights.

04:44.939 --> 04:47.287
I have to go home.

04:50.704 --> 04:52.602
My name is Jordan.

04:52.637 --> 04:54.501
Goodnight, Jordan.

04:54.535 --> 04:56.503
Don't be sad if I don't call.

04:56.537 --> 04:58.367
I won't be.

04:58.401 --> 05:00.058
Don't be mad if I do call.

05:00.092 --> 05:01.128
You won't.

05:01.162 --> 05:02.302
How do you know?

05:02.336 --> 05:05.443
I gave you the wrong number.

05:47.174 --> 05:49.314
Shit!

05:57.253 --> 05:59.945
You sting me cause
I stole the girl's money?

06:12.855 --> 06:14.960
Morgan Gandara.

06:23.244 --> 06:25.764
It's her birthday today.

06:38.052 --> 06:40.227
You're late, Morgan.

06:40.261 --> 06:42.056
I stopped for pie.

06:42.091 --> 06:43.920
Enjoy the movie?

06:43.955 --> 06:46.854
It was... interesting.

06:46.889 --> 06:48.235
Hey honey.

06:48.269 --> 06:50.789
Are you hungry?
There's some cake left.

06:50.824 --> 06:52.791
No, I stopped for pie Mom.

06:52.826 --> 06:55.311
Get some rest.
Your appointment's at eight.

06:55.345 --> 06:58.694
I know. Bailey awake?

06:58.728 --> 07:00.420
He's asleep.

07:01.386 --> 07:03.871
Did you enjoy your birthday,
darling?

07:03.906 --> 07:06.184
I did. Thanks.

07:06.218 --> 07:08.669
Goodnight. I love you both.

07:08.704 --> 07:09.774
Goodnight.

07:09.808 --> 07:11.810
We love you too.

07:21.475 --> 07:24.616
Jordan. What the hell?

07:24.651 --> 07:27.550
You missed
your own birthday party!

07:30.139 --> 07:32.486
Sorry.

07:32.521 --> 07:35.213
Where's my money?

07:35.247 --> 07:37.353
Tomorrow. I promise.

07:37.387 --> 07:40.494
You said that yesterday.

07:43.497 --> 07:45.568
Can you stay longer?

07:47.018 --> 07:49.020
Go back to sleep, Misty.

08:19.878 --> 08:22.398
The dragonfly boy
couldn't stop thinking of

08:22.432 --> 08:24.193
the princess of bees.

08:24.227 --> 08:29.163
He became obsessed with her.
He was falling in love. Madly.

08:29.198 --> 08:33.684
But he knew the queen bee would never allow them to be together.

08:44.972 --> 08:46.629
The metastatic tumor has grown

08:46.664 --> 08:49.011
and is creating pressure
in Morgan's skull.

08:49.045 --> 08:52.980
Her brain tissue
is swelling at an alarming rate.

08:53.015 --> 08:55.396
She's never mentioned any pain.

08:55.431 --> 08:57.916
The only thing she's felt
are these headaches.

08:57.951 --> 09:01.264
I mean it's possible
the tumor is shrinking.

09:01.299 --> 09:04.060
Possible, but it's unlikely.

09:04.095 --> 09:05.579
We need to take the next step.

09:05.614 --> 09:08.478
More chemo? We tried that
and it still came back.

09:08.513 --> 09:09.894
Well chemotherapy
isn't as helpful

09:09.928 --> 09:12.586
when you're dealing
with metastatic tumors.

09:12.621 --> 09:15.175
We would need to take a
more aggressive approach.

09:15.209 --> 09:16.383
No!

09:16.417 --> 09:18.143
Isn't there a way
you can just remove it?

09:18.178 --> 09:20.939
That's what the doctor says.

09:20.974 --> 09:25.599
I heard her speech is different.
And today she dropped her purse.

09:25.634 --> 09:28.775
- She was getting out of the car and she dropped her...
- Decreased coordination is

09:28.809 --> 09:29.810
a symptom.

09:29.845 --> 09:31.881
We need to get her
to MD Anderson in Houston.

09:31.916 --> 09:35.057
- We're just running out of options here.
- Why Houston? Why not here?

09:35.091 --> 09:41.442
Well Janet,
this form of cancer at this stage, is...

09:41.477 --> 09:43.168
I'm afraid it's irreversible.

09:43.203 --> 09:45.688
The swelling in her brain
is only going to get worse.

09:45.723 --> 09:48.657
At least in Houston,
they can monitor her condition better.

09:48.691 --> 09:51.936
They are the best
in the country.

09:54.421 --> 09:57.182
And if we don't go...

09:57.217 --> 09:59.150
How much longer
are we looking at?

09:59.184 --> 10:01.117
I don't wanna hear this shit!

10:01.152 --> 10:02.394
Oh Bailey! Sweetie!

10:05.156 --> 10:06.744
Sorry.

10:06.778 --> 10:09.712
They're just
so sick of hospitals and

10:09.747 --> 10:12.957
Morgan really just wants
to be at home with the family.

10:12.991 --> 10:15.062
I understand.

10:15.097 --> 10:19.101
It's difficult to say how long.

10:19.135 --> 10:21.551
Three months, maybe.

10:22.414 --> 10:25.038
Three months?

10:26.936 --> 10:29.180
Oh, god!

10:34.875 --> 10:37.637
Alright c'mon. Let's go! Let's go!
- Oh yeah?

10:37.671 --> 10:39.293
Nope, nope, nope!

10:39.328 --> 10:41.088
Oh!

10:43.608 --> 10:46.093
Maybe she shouldn't
be exhausting herself like that.

10:46.128 --> 10:47.957
She's just trying
to make Bailey feel better.

10:47.992 --> 10:49.718
Well, Bailey's fine.
If she falls...

10:49.752 --> 10:54.792
Dennis! Don't. Just let her
spend time with her brother.

10:56.207 --> 10:57.277
Who won?

10:57.311 --> 10:59.003
Half time! I'm up by three!

10:59.037 --> 10:59.969
Yeah right. He cheated.

11:00.004 --> 11:02.558
His foot was on the line.
He's up by two!

11:06.251 --> 11:08.944
- Janet?
- I just need some time!

11:08.978 --> 11:11.222
Well, wait.

11:26.858 --> 11:29.999
Does Morgan Gandara live here?

11:30.034 --> 11:31.898
Do you know her?

11:31.932 --> 11:34.038
I found her wallet.
I'm here to return it.

11:34.072 --> 11:35.936
So she here or no?

11:36.592 --> 11:37.973
I can take it for you.

11:38.007 --> 11:40.113
I'd rather hand it to her myself
if it's all the same.

11:40.147 --> 11:41.528
Where did you find it?

11:41.562 --> 11:43.633
Wherever she lost it
is where I found it.

11:43.668 --> 11:45.014
You Scottish?

11:45.049 --> 11:46.740
I can see where she gets
all the questions from.

11:46.775 --> 11:48.500
So you do know her?

11:48.535 --> 11:52.056
Yeah, uh. Look, just
tell her I called.

11:52.090 --> 11:52.953
You mean came by?

11:52.988 --> 11:55.369
Just say I called,
she'll get it.

11:56.750 --> 12:00.202
Yo, why are you wearing a skirt?

12:00.236 --> 12:02.066
My jersey was dirty?

12:02.100 --> 12:04.206
You getting signatures
for some gay rights petition?

12:04.240 --> 12:05.552
C'mon Bailey!
That's enough!

12:05.586 --> 12:07.416
Would you sign it if I was?

12:07.450 --> 12:09.659
C'mon, Dad.
Just sign his petition!

12:09.694 --> 12:11.144
Love is love around here!

12:11.178 --> 12:14.457
He's not looking for signatures.
He found Morgan's wallet.

12:14.492 --> 12:16.114
Huh.

12:16.149 --> 12:18.392
- Morgan! Door!
- No no no!

12:18.427 --> 12:19.704
Oh.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.465
- You got a visitor.
- You know this character?

12:22.500 --> 12:23.535
Yeah.

12:23.570 --> 12:25.296
What are you doing here?

12:25.330 --> 12:27.574
I would have called, but uh...

12:27.608 --> 12:30.853
I guess I just have
the wrong number.

12:30.888 --> 12:32.752
I found it.

12:32.786 --> 12:35.064
I must have left it
in the theater.

12:35.099 --> 12:38.067
Must have.

12:38.102 --> 12:39.931
Dad.

12:39.966 --> 12:43.521
You're just gonna stay in here and watch them flirt with each other?

12:43.555 --> 12:46.006
Okay, i'll just...

12:46.041 --> 12:49.078
I'll just go somewhere else.

12:49.113 --> 12:50.597
Yeah.

12:51.011 --> 12:53.634
So, Morgan!

12:53.669 --> 12:55.429
What movie did you two
see again?

12:55.464 --> 12:56.810
- What was it called?
- Bailey!

12:56.845 --> 12:58.191
Shut up!

12:58.743 --> 13:01.090
"Bailey, Shut up!"

13:03.334 --> 13:04.473
He's cute.

13:04.507 --> 13:06.233
Yeah.

13:07.545 --> 13:09.512
Thanks for unstealing my wallet.

13:09.547 --> 13:11.204
You're welcome.

13:12.412 --> 13:13.931
So, can I come in?

13:13.965 --> 13:17.072
Why?
There's no valuables inside.

13:17.106 --> 13:20.282
I just want to see where
the dragonfly sleeps.

13:43.650 --> 13:45.410
Why do you have
an Asian brother?

13:45.445 --> 13:47.171
Because I have an Asian brother.

13:47.205 --> 13:51.623
Satisfied? It's just a room.
I sleep there.

13:51.658 --> 13:53.763
You happy now?

13:53.798 --> 13:55.593
What are you,
a "flasher" on the weekends?

13:55.627 --> 13:56.905
A flasher?

13:56.939 --> 13:59.908
Well you know,
those guys that run into a crowd,

13:59.942 --> 14:03.601
open their coat,
flash everyone their cock and then run out.

14:03.635 --> 14:05.879
That's a detective's coat.

14:05.914 --> 14:07.122
My Dad was a detective,

14:07.156 --> 14:08.778
so I kind of grew up
in that fold.

14:08.813 --> 14:11.989
So that's what you wanna be
when you get all grown up?

14:12.023 --> 14:15.440
Take over all your dad's
unsolved cases?

14:17.235 --> 14:18.927
Maybe.

14:20.204 --> 14:23.483
Look, I don't mean
to be mean. But uh...

14:23.517 --> 14:26.106
I'm really tired.

14:26.141 --> 14:29.592
Well I'm not leaving until I find out something about you I like.

14:29.627 --> 14:33.113
Right now,
you're pretty perfect.

14:33.148 --> 14:35.322
Close your eyes.

14:35.357 --> 14:37.531
You won't like this...

14:37.566 --> 14:39.499
What are you gonna do?
Flash me?

14:39.533 --> 14:40.638
My eyes need to be
open for that.

14:40.672 --> 14:42.329
I'm pretty sure
I'll like what I see.

14:42.364 --> 14:44.193
Close them!

14:59.070 --> 15:00.969
Okay, open them.

15:06.664 --> 15:08.183
Who am I?

15:08.217 --> 15:09.218
I don't know.

15:09.253 --> 15:10.771
Inspector Gadget?

15:10.806 --> 15:13.188
Inspector Clouseau!

15:13.222 --> 15:15.362
From the Pink Panther?
The famous French detective?

15:15.397 --> 15:16.846
Are you serious?

15:16.881 --> 15:19.815
I mean I heard of the Pink Panther,
but I always thought it was a

15:19.849 --> 15:21.541
- kinky sex position.
- Unbelievable!

15:21.575 --> 15:22.818
We're watching one.

15:22.852 --> 15:25.545
Didn't we just see
a movie last night?

15:25.579 --> 15:27.271
My parents worry a lot.

15:27.305 --> 15:30.584
Movie theaters are much safer
than night clubs.

15:30.619 --> 15:32.828
Depends on the movie.

15:32.862 --> 15:35.003
Well, if you're not leaving

15:35.037 --> 15:39.766
How about I show you the entire movie in five minutes interactively?

15:39.800 --> 15:41.492
What do you mean?

15:45.703 --> 15:49.569
You have exactly 30 seconds to hide this key anywhere in this room

15:49.603 --> 15:51.709
And as a highly experienced
detective,

15:51.743 --> 15:53.780
I will find it no more
than three minutes.

15:53.814 --> 15:55.713
Hmm. You wanna bet on that?

15:55.747 --> 15:57.094
What you got?

15:57.128 --> 15:59.199
It's not what I got.
It's what I want.

15:59.234 --> 16:01.063
And what's that?

16:02.271 --> 16:03.928
You.

16:05.654 --> 16:08.070
If you lose,

16:08.105 --> 16:12.109
you have to spend the
entire night with me.

16:13.489 --> 16:15.250
And if I win,

16:15.284 --> 16:19.323
you leave immediately
and you never return.

16:21.739 --> 16:23.844
You're on!

16:23.879 --> 16:27.193
I'm going to blindfold you.

16:27.227 --> 16:28.988
Girls cheat.

16:40.861 --> 16:42.553
Don't peek.

16:43.416 --> 16:45.935
I'm hiding it now.

17:09.752 --> 17:11.409
Done.

17:12.997 --> 17:15.275
Solve the case, detective.

17:16.380 --> 17:18.692
Most cases are solved

17:18.727 --> 17:21.936
not by knowing where
it is hidden,

17:21.971 --> 17:26.320
but by whom it was hidden by.

17:32.741 --> 17:33.362
You give up?

17:33.397 --> 17:34.950
Um...

17:34.984 --> 17:40.852
Never. I gave up giving up
many years ago.

17:40.887 --> 17:42.095
You want a hint?

17:42.130 --> 17:44.097
Oh, but you have already
given me so many.

17:44.132 --> 17:45.340
Bullshit, have not.

17:45.374 --> 17:47.376
I know exactly where
the key is hidden.

17:47.411 --> 17:48.584
You're bluffing.

17:48.619 --> 17:50.069
Am I?

17:52.312 --> 17:54.073
I raise the bet.

17:54.659 --> 17:56.351
If you lose,

17:56.385 --> 18:00.631
You have to feed me and you have to spend the night with me!

18:00.665 --> 18:03.047
And when you lose, you leave.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.912
But before you do,
you cook for my entire family.

18:05.946 --> 18:07.431
I don't cook.

18:07.465 --> 18:09.605
Then I better be bluffing.

18:10.606 --> 18:12.263
Deal!

18:16.578 --> 18:20.409
First thing to know when you are given a case is expect the unexpected.

18:20.444 --> 18:22.515
That way you won't
be surprised by anything

18:22.549 --> 18:25.794
In this case,
the unexpected is expected.

18:25.828 --> 18:29.315
I would never expect you to hide the key
somewhere where I'd expect it to be

18:29.349 --> 18:33.457
so that's exactly where
I should expect to find it.

18:33.491 --> 18:34.975
You scare me.

18:37.806 --> 18:40.188
Just as I expected.

18:40.222 --> 18:42.017
But how?

18:42.051 --> 18:44.502
Same way you got my wallet.

18:44.537 --> 18:47.402
Use the blindfold as a decoy

18:47.436 --> 18:49.197
like your kiss.

18:51.751 --> 18:54.167
About your wallet, I'm sorry.

18:54.202 --> 18:56.135
Everything's still in there.
I...

18:56.169 --> 18:57.481
tried to steal it at first

18:57.515 --> 19:00.069
but I got punished,
so I put it all back.

19:00.104 --> 19:02.175
Who punished you?

19:02.210 --> 19:04.419
One of your private eyes.

19:04.453 --> 19:07.146
Little fella,
black and yellow suit.

19:08.181 --> 19:10.114
I got stung by a bee!

19:10.149 --> 19:13.082
It's not my bee.

19:13.117 --> 19:15.775
You're a very strange girl,
Morgan.

19:15.809 --> 19:19.261
No. I'm a hungry girl.

19:19.296 --> 19:21.470
I'm starving.
Where's your girlfriend

19:21.505 --> 19:22.575
Patience, Bails.

19:22.609 --> 19:23.748
Girlfriend?

19:23.783 --> 19:24.818
He's not my girlfriend.

19:24.853 --> 19:27.096
Wait, "he's"?
I'm confused.

19:27.131 --> 19:29.409
So, who's this guy? Clearly?

19:29.444 --> 19:32.240
He is just different,
that's all.

19:32.274 --> 19:34.897
And you met this different
guy at the theater.

19:34.932 --> 19:36.968
I'd hardly call him a guy, Mom.

19:37.003 --> 19:38.763
Why? Is he...

19:38.798 --> 19:41.387
Oh! Is he one of those
metrosexuals?

19:41.421 --> 19:42.733
Is he pretty?

19:42.767 --> 19:43.975
You'll see.

19:44.010 --> 19:46.461
He expresses himself,
that's what's important.

19:46.495 --> 19:49.015
Not everyone is brave
enough to do that.

19:50.499 --> 19:53.916
How is it wearing a skirt
makes you brave?

19:53.951 --> 19:55.953
Like a kilt, you mean?
Like a, Irish?

19:55.987 --> 19:57.161
Oh, Scottish!

19:57.196 --> 20:00.854
No. He just likes skirts,
so what?

20:02.891 --> 20:04.789
All of you behave.

20:05.894 --> 20:08.207
Dad, be nice.

20:08.241 --> 20:10.347
When am I not nice?

20:12.280 --> 20:15.144
- And there's a man at the door.
- Yes, just...

20:15.179 --> 20:17.561
I can't wait to see this.

20:20.115 --> 20:23.394
Pizza?
I thought he was making dinner.

20:23.429 --> 20:29.607
No, I was making dinner... happen.
And it's happening.

20:33.715 --> 20:34.819
Mom!

20:34.854 --> 20:35.889
What?

20:35.924 --> 20:37.028
Don't stare.

20:37.063 --> 20:38.996
- Oh, I'm--
- No, it's okay.

20:39.030 --> 20:40.411
If I'm going to
look this pretty,

20:40.446 --> 20:43.276
I have to get used to the
attention it brings, right?

20:43.311 --> 20:45.382
I didn't catch your name.

20:46.590 --> 20:48.212
I'm Jordan.

20:51.526 --> 20:52.768
Dennis.

20:56.082 --> 20:58.153
That's a strong grip, Dennis.

21:02.433 --> 21:04.297
I'm Janet.

21:04.332 --> 21:06.506
I assume you've met Bailey.

21:06.541 --> 21:07.404
I did.

21:07.438 --> 21:10.855
Aw yeah. I shall call
you Air Jordan.

21:10.890 --> 21:14.411
BOOSH! Let's eat!

21:16.413 --> 21:21.556
So, Jordan...
Where are you from?

21:21.590 --> 21:24.110
I don't like to focus on
the past much.

21:24.144 --> 21:26.112
Waste of time if you ask me.

21:26.906 --> 21:28.494
Well, where's your family?

21:28.528 --> 21:29.357
Dad!

21:29.391 --> 21:31.945
It's just a question, Morgan.

21:31.980 --> 21:34.154
Well I'm assuming...

21:34.189 --> 21:36.847
my Mom is exactly where she was
when I left.

21:36.881 --> 21:38.158
On the couch.

21:38.193 --> 21:39.574
And my Dad, well,

21:39.608 --> 21:42.266
he left before I was me,
so there's that.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.682
Have you lived here long?

21:44.717 --> 21:47.236
I just sorta go

21:47.271 --> 21:48.341
when it's time to go.

21:48.376 --> 21:50.309
Not much for nesting,
personally.

21:50.343 --> 21:52.069
I like to travel as well.

21:52.103 --> 21:54.623
What statement are you trying to make by wearing that skirt?

21:54.658 --> 21:55.728
Dad!

21:55.762 --> 21:57.143
It's just a question!

21:57.177 --> 21:59.559
I'm just curious as to what compels him to dress like a female.

21:59.594 --> 22:04.253
He shouldn't do it if he can't answer why he does it.

22:04.288 --> 22:05.738
Isn't that right, Jordan?

22:05.772 --> 22:07.878
I guess I just find it
a little disturbing

22:07.912 --> 22:14.367
that society says girls wear skirts and dresses
and boys wear pants and cargo shorts.

22:14.402 --> 22:16.749
It's all the same fabric
cut differently.

22:16.783 --> 22:18.820
We're all the same people,
raised differently.

22:18.854 --> 22:21.650
So, wearing a skirt is just your way to rebel against society.

22:21.685 --> 22:22.686
I understand that.

22:22.720 --> 22:23.756
It's not rebelling,

22:23.790 --> 22:25.965
it's just simply acknowledging
the fact that

22:25.999 --> 22:28.139
this stereotype is bullshit.

22:28.174 --> 22:30.279
Why not just wear
what you want to wear?

22:30.314 --> 22:31.626
Be who you want to be?

22:31.660 --> 22:32.834
Yeah, I agree.

22:32.868 --> 22:37.839
You know, makeup was common
with men in the old days.

22:37.873 --> 22:39.081
See?

22:39.116 --> 22:42.257
It's about self liberation.

22:42.291 --> 22:44.570
Free yourself from the
shackles of conformity.

22:44.604 --> 22:46.606
Yeah, sure.

22:46.641 --> 22:48.297
Become unemployed

22:48.332 --> 22:50.230
Get a gun, do drugs

22:50.265 --> 22:52.612
As long as it expresses
your individuality.

22:52.647 --> 22:54.338
Whoa, who said anything
about a gun?

22:54.373 --> 22:57.410
Guns are for pussies
who can't fight.

22:57.445 --> 23:00.206
How about we change the subject?

23:00.240 --> 23:03.416
How do you plan on
supporting a family?

23:03.451 --> 23:05.798
How are you ever going
to finance a house?

23:05.832 --> 23:07.903
I don't need a house.

23:09.042 --> 23:10.803
Jordan, have you
ever been arrested?

23:10.837 --> 23:12.252
- Dad!
- Please!

23:12.287 --> 23:14.323
That's extremely rude.

23:14.358 --> 23:16.015
Jordan, let's eat
the rest upstairs.

23:16.049 --> 23:19.432
I just want to know why he has no regard for the rules put in place.

23:19.467 --> 23:20.709
No, dammit.
Don't...

23:20.744 --> 23:23.678
Jordan, take anything
that he says personally.

23:23.712 --> 23:26.888
He's just, he's a...
he's an old fart.

23:28.027 --> 23:29.546
He just, you know

23:29.580 --> 23:32.756
doesn't want his daughter dating a domestic terrorist, bro.

23:34.585 --> 23:37.726
Domestic terrorists are usually
well educated, white,

23:37.761 --> 23:42.731
ultra religious,
second amendment loving right wing fanatics!

23:42.766 --> 23:47.080
I'm a poor,
unemployed Atheist mutt.

23:47.115 --> 23:49.807
I'm like a father's
dream come true!

23:49.842 --> 23:53.397
You're worse than he is.
I'm eating alone.

23:55.054 --> 23:57.953
It was lovely meeting you all.

23:58.989 --> 24:00.749
Morgan!

24:01.992 --> 24:04.201
- Oh, come on!
- What the hell?

24:04.235 --> 24:05.720
You were a hippie once too.

24:05.754 --> 24:07.894
That's not a hippie!
I was nothing like that!

24:07.929 --> 24:10.276
Morgan is a gay lesbian.

24:10.310 --> 24:12.312
Oh sweetie, your sister
is not a lesbian.

24:12.347 --> 24:14.418
Lesbians like girls, but

24:14.453 --> 24:17.490
if the lesbian is gay,
she likes boys.

24:17.525 --> 24:19.354
She's a gay lesbian.

24:19.388 --> 24:23.220
I'm so confused,
does that mean that he is a straight homosexual?

24:37.165 --> 24:39.339
Wait! Wait!

24:39.374 --> 24:41.721
What?
I'm not a domestic terrorist!

24:43.378 --> 24:45.656
I like where this is going,

24:45.691 --> 24:47.624
just not here.

24:49.142 --> 24:51.213
Good idea, your Dad scares me.

24:51.248 --> 24:54.493
That just cause you scare him.

24:54.527 --> 24:58.669
My place. I have the best view
of the entire city.

24:58.704 --> 25:00.464
Let's go.

25:09.438 --> 25:11.889
- Who are they?
- They're nobody.

25:12.683 --> 25:17.654
Look who's back... with company.

25:17.688 --> 25:20.104
Morgan, this is Misty.
Misty, Morgan.

25:20.139 --> 25:22.072
It's nice to meet you, Misty.

25:22.106 --> 25:23.729
Where did you find her? Church?

25:23.763 --> 25:24.626
Why church?

25:24.661 --> 25:26.490
I'm so sorry, how rude of me.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.768
I'm not used to him bringing
girls home. You know?

25:28.803 --> 25:33.635
They're usually anorexic twinks.
Nice to meet you, Morgan.

25:33.670 --> 25:35.361
Let's go.

25:35.395 --> 25:37.087
Hey, Morgan!

25:37.121 --> 25:39.572
Has he taken your wallet yet?

25:39.607 --> 25:44.439
Yeah, that's what
swept me off my feet.

25:44.473 --> 25:47.718
I want my money tonight
or you're out!

25:56.140 --> 25:57.866
: You live up here?

26:00.282 --> 26:01.767
Told you...

26:02.595 --> 26:04.701
Best view of the city.

26:07.945 --> 26:09.602
You impressed, yet?

26:11.052 --> 26:12.225
Where do you pee?

26:12.260 --> 26:14.952
I have four options.

26:16.126 --> 26:18.059
How do you poop?

26:20.544 --> 26:22.891
Why do you owe that girl money?

26:22.926 --> 26:24.962
Here we go again
with the questions.

26:24.997 --> 26:26.136
Sorry, it's a bad habit.

26:26.170 --> 26:29.760
It's the detective in me. Well?

26:29.795 --> 26:33.868
I borrowed some money from her and haven't paid her back yet.
It's no big deal.

26:33.902 --> 26:35.421
How much?

26:35.455 --> 26:36.456
Seriously?

26:36.491 --> 26:38.182
Was it for drugs?

26:38.217 --> 26:41.047
Wow. No, it was not for drugs.

26:42.048 --> 26:45.293
It was for, believe it or not,
art school.

26:45.327 --> 26:47.122
You go to art school?

26:47.157 --> 26:49.055
I did...

26:49.090 --> 26:53.542
for about seven weeks,
but it was a total scam.

26:55.475 --> 26:57.167
You wanna go inside?

26:57.201 --> 26:59.169
Yeah.

26:59.203 --> 27:00.308
You okay?

27:00.342 --> 27:01.481
Yeah.

27:01.516 --> 27:03.656
Great,
I just get dizzy sometimes.

27:03.691 --> 27:05.071
You afraid of heights?

27:05.106 --> 27:08.696
I love heights!
Let's just go in your palace.

27:15.081 --> 27:16.565
Thanks.

27:24.366 --> 27:26.161
Is she your ex-girlfriend?

27:26.196 --> 27:28.543
She is, isn't she?

27:29.717 --> 27:31.857
For the next five minutes,

27:31.891 --> 27:34.135
no more questions.

27:37.310 --> 27:39.554
Just one more?

27:46.078 --> 27:47.631
OK. Ask your question.

27:47.666 --> 27:50.013
Don't you get lonely up here?

27:51.497 --> 27:53.223
Not really.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.157
That's a lie.

27:56.191 --> 28:00.299
Looking down,
avoiding eye contact, tone changes.

28:00.333 --> 28:03.751
All signs of a big fat lie.

28:05.131 --> 28:07.858
I'm not lonely right now.

28:24.772 --> 28:27.326
I looked so different back then.

28:27.360 --> 28:29.052
Way back when you were innocent.

28:30.778 --> 28:32.780
Which brings us to today.

28:32.814 --> 28:35.644
Paging Doctor Colson at the E.R.

28:40.201 --> 28:43.998
Maybe we should explain why we have the doctor tied up in the closet.

28:44.032 --> 28:47.242
We don't want your family
to get the wrong idea.

28:47.277 --> 28:52.247
Good thinking.
Doctor, you should probably watch this too.

28:55.423 --> 28:57.528
Told you, it's stupid.

28:57.563 --> 28:59.738
Shut it. I'm reading.

29:00.808 --> 29:03.362
He was falling in love. Madly.

29:03.396 --> 29:08.539
But he knew, the queen bee would
never allow them to be together.

29:08.574 --> 29:10.541
The dragonfly boy had an idea

29:10.576 --> 29:15.788
an idea so great,
he was sure that the Queen bee would be fooled

29:15.823 --> 29:20.689
and the princess of bees would now be allowed to love him forever.

29:20.724 --> 29:23.865
He flew up to the cupboard,
opened it

29:23.900 --> 29:27.041
and grabbed a jar of honey.

29:28.905 --> 29:32.287
I love it. You made this?

29:33.323 --> 29:34.807
You really like it?

29:34.842 --> 29:38.121
Yes. They're in love.

29:39.881 --> 29:44.161
It's just a story,
not even a very good one.

29:44.196 --> 29:48.441
Love stories are the only stories worth telling.

29:48.476 --> 29:50.236
Why'd you quit art school?

29:51.306 --> 29:54.447
You're only good if
you do it their way.

29:54.482 --> 29:56.449
If you play by their rules.

29:56.484 --> 29:58.072
My rebel!

29:58.935 --> 30:01.592
Are you the
little dragonfly boy?

30:01.627 --> 30:04.423
No, you are.

30:04.457 --> 30:06.390
I'm the princess bee.

30:12.776 --> 30:14.847
I have to go.

30:16.504 --> 30:18.506
Thought you were
staying the night.

30:18.540 --> 30:21.578
You lost the bet, remember?

30:21.612 --> 30:23.752
Good night, princess.

30:39.907 --> 30:41.391
Baby?

30:44.843 --> 30:50.400
You can't runaway from this.
We need to talk about it.

30:50.434 --> 30:53.127
It's not easy for any of us.

30:54.231 --> 30:56.682
We just...

30:56.716 --> 30:58.857
We just want to do
what's best for you.

30:58.891 --> 31:01.998
Then just act normal
to me again?

31:03.965 --> 31:05.380
Okay.

31:08.280 --> 31:09.557
They're um,

31:09.591 --> 31:11.697
They're sending us to
a specialist.

31:14.424 --> 31:16.702
Your results came in.

31:18.117 --> 31:19.705
It's...

31:21.603 --> 31:22.811
Your situation is--

31:22.846 --> 31:24.296
What did they say?

31:24.330 --> 31:30.095
They're going to take you
right away. In Houston.

31:30.129 --> 31:34.375
If they can fix me there,
they can fix me here.

31:48.596 --> 31:52.048
They can't fix you here, baby.

31:54.740 --> 31:56.293
I'm sorry.

31:57.639 --> 31:59.883
But they can't.

32:04.577 --> 32:06.165
What's going on?

32:07.580 --> 32:08.719
Are you okay, Dad?

32:08.754 --> 32:11.791
Yeah, Buddy. It's okay.

32:16.589 --> 32:18.350
It's okay.

32:25.150 --> 32:26.772
Jordan?

32:32.467 --> 32:34.607
Detective Colossus.

32:34.642 --> 32:36.471
Inspector Clouseau!

32:37.748 --> 32:40.820
Dragonfly boy missed
his princess bee already?

32:40.855 --> 32:44.341
Wait.
I need to tell you something.

32:44.376 --> 32:45.618
You have a boyfriend?

32:45.653 --> 32:48.104
I don't care.
I wasn't born with a jealous bone.

32:48.138 --> 32:51.003
Everybody was born with
a jealous bone, but no.

32:51.038 --> 32:54.420
I don't have a boyfriend.
I have something else.

32:54.455 --> 32:57.665
- Just listen to me.
- I'm listening, what is it?

32:57.699 --> 33:00.219
I have a brain tumor!

33:01.496 --> 33:05.017
A brain tumor? Like what,
a tumor in your brain?

33:05.052 --> 33:09.677
Yep. A brain tumor,
a tumor in my brain.

33:09.711 --> 33:10.747
Does it hurt?

33:10.781 --> 33:11.851
Mmhmm.

33:11.886 --> 33:13.267
Is it serious?

33:13.301 --> 33:15.855
Yes. It is serious.

33:16.960 --> 33:20.308
Well can't a doctor
like suck it out

33:20.343 --> 33:22.034
or do whatever it is
that doctors do?

33:22.069 --> 33:25.382
No. It's in my brain.

33:26.694 --> 33:27.729
But, how?

33:27.764 --> 33:31.664
They found a lump here
two years ago.

33:31.699 --> 33:35.358
They got out all the
malignant cells

33:35.392 --> 33:39.672
but last year, we learned that
it spread to my brain.

33:39.707 --> 33:42.813
It's... irreversible.

33:42.848 --> 33:45.057
Nothing's irreversible.

33:45.092 --> 33:50.890
I came to tell you that's why
I gave you the wrong number.

33:50.925 --> 33:52.099
I still found you.

33:52.133 --> 33:54.791
And that I'm leaving tomorrow.

33:54.825 --> 33:56.103
Where are you going?

33:56.137 --> 34:00.693
Texas. They have to take over
my situation.

34:00.728 --> 34:02.592
When are you coming back?

34:02.626 --> 34:04.939
I don't know.

34:04.973 --> 34:06.285
You don't look sick.

34:06.320 --> 34:10.841
Yeah.
It's what's on the inside that counts.

34:10.876 --> 34:11.532
Wait!

34:13.016 --> 34:17.054
It can't be like this,
just like that. Doesn't feel right.

34:17.089 --> 34:19.609
I know it doesn't.

34:19.643 --> 34:22.335
Wait! Just hear me out!
OK?

34:22.370 --> 34:26.926
If it is irreversible,
they can't do anything right? I can do that.

34:26.960 --> 34:27.996
So why go?

34:28.031 --> 34:31.379
For my family.
They need this.

34:31.414 --> 34:32.346
Wait!

34:32.380 --> 34:35.487
Just, what?
Just, just stop saying wait!

34:35.521 --> 34:37.454
I meant stay.

34:37.489 --> 34:38.489
Fuck.

34:49.984 --> 34:51.606
See that?

34:51.641 --> 34:54.505
You probably thought it was a couple of lunatics that kidnapped you.

34:54.540 --> 34:57.129
In reality, we're just
two birds in love.

34:57.164 --> 34:59.062
Hey, you okay in there?

34:59.097 --> 35:03.342
Uh, just...
Uh, just my...

35:03.377 --> 35:04.585
Morgan? Morgan!

35:12.731 --> 35:15.975
♪ ...You're my best friend

35:17.460 --> 35:23.431
♪ M-O-R-G-A-N

35:24.536 --> 35:27.297
♪ When you went

35:28.712 --> 35:32.026
♪ I crossed my heart

35:32.060 --> 35:35.098
♪ Promised you

35:35.133 --> 35:38.274
♪ To never be apart

35:39.723 --> 35:46.005
♪ Cause you're my little girl
you're my best friend. ♪

35:47.593 --> 35:53.634
♪ M-O-R-G-A-N

35:59.571 --> 36:03.195
The tumor in Morgan's brain
is spreading very quickly.

36:03.230 --> 36:06.647
We ran numerous tests and right now we only have one option.

36:06.681 --> 36:10.892
Do it again with a wave of radiation and see if it reactions.

36:10.927 --> 36:14.102
We came here because you
guys are the best.

36:15.207 --> 36:17.382
Tell me you can do
something to help her.

36:17.416 --> 36:20.074
The chances of her recovery
are very low.

36:20.108 --> 36:23.111
We'll continue to do
everything we can.

36:23.146 --> 36:25.217
But this condition

36:25.252 --> 36:27.392
it never ends well.

36:27.426 --> 36:33.191
What we can do is make her transition as comfortable as possible.

36:33.225 --> 36:36.401
Eliminate most of the pain.

36:36.435 --> 36:41.233
But it's not going to be easy
for her or her family.

36:42.579 --> 36:45.410
Y-you're tell me my daughter
is going to die?

36:45.444 --> 36:48.827
When we get to a point where there is nothing more to be done,

36:48.861 --> 36:51.312
we recommend that you take her.

36:51.347 --> 36:53.763
Where she's home
with her family.

36:53.797 --> 36:58.008
We should start radiation here
as soon as possible.

36:58.043 --> 37:01.115
We'll make an incision,
take some blood

37:01.149 --> 37:03.151
some tissues,
some bone samples

37:03.186 --> 37:06.672
to gauge the affectivity
of it now.

37:06.707 --> 37:09.088
May I begin the prep?

37:09.848 --> 37:12.540
What if I take her home today?

37:13.886 --> 37:16.061
What should we expect to see?

37:16.924 --> 37:19.340
More frequent headaches
will emerge.

37:19.375 --> 37:23.620
Confusion, numbness, maybe
some personality changes.

37:23.655 --> 37:28.384
Difficulty in speech
and possibly seizures.

37:28.418 --> 37:30.834
We recommend
you don't leave yet.

37:32.871 --> 37:35.183
Three months.

37:36.288 --> 37:42.398
You know, it doesn't
really matter where that is.

37:42.432 --> 37:47.368
You start your prep and
then we will just...

37:49.405 --> 37:51.890
If it doesn't work,
we'll take her home.

37:51.924 --> 37:53.340
Of course.

37:53.374 --> 37:57.551
Three... Two... One...
He shoots!

37:57.585 --> 37:58.621
He misses!

37:58.655 --> 38:00.450
But there's still a
half-second on the clock,

38:00.485 --> 38:04.005
Bailey with the rebound
Wha-pow-pow-pow!

38:06.629 --> 38:09.183
And the crowd goes wild!

38:15.085 --> 38:16.846
We're all set.

38:20.021 --> 38:22.127
You ready to go, my love?

38:23.577 --> 38:26.580
The dragonfly boy
covered himself in honey.

38:26.614 --> 38:31.964
As he did this,
the dragonflies above began to leave one by one.

38:31.999 --> 38:35.727
The dragonfly boy was
now all alone.

38:35.761 --> 38:39.075
The dragonfly boy walked
all day and all night,

38:39.109 --> 38:41.802
covered head to toe in honey.

38:41.836 --> 38:47.359
Many bees from the local village hives
began to be attracted to his coat of honey.

38:47.394 --> 38:49.879
The bees would swarm
to the dragonfly boy,

38:49.913 --> 38:53.331
sticking to the dragonfly boy's
honey-glued body.

38:53.365 --> 38:56.368
Soon, covering the
dragonfly boy entirely

38:56.403 --> 38:58.957
making him look no longer
like a dragonfly,

38:58.991 --> 39:02.961
but now as a giant bee himself.

39:02.995 --> 39:05.653
He arrived at the Queen Bee's
honeycombed castle

39:05.688 --> 39:09.036
and is approached
by the royal bee guard.

39:09.070 --> 39:10.658
"May I help you?"

39:10.693 --> 39:14.593
"Yes, I am a prince bee
from a far away kingdom"

39:14.628 --> 39:18.010
"I am here to offer my heart
to the Princess Bee."

39:18.045 --> 39:20.427
"We will take you to the Queen"

39:21.704 --> 39:25.052
Hey, stranger.
What are you doing?

39:25.086 --> 39:28.435
Just doodling. Why?

39:29.884 --> 39:32.266
It's like an orgy down there,

39:32.300 --> 39:35.373
everybody's so fucked
out of their brains.

39:35.407 --> 39:37.892
Thought you were into that.

39:39.204 --> 39:41.689
Well it depends who's involved.

39:41.724 --> 39:43.104
You wanna go down there?

39:43.139 --> 39:46.245
- Come on.
- I was just leaving.

39:47.385 --> 39:50.042
Don't be such a grouch.
Have a drink.

39:50.077 --> 39:52.769
- Come on!
- What are you on right now?

39:52.804 --> 39:55.945
Wine! God.

40:02.469 --> 40:03.331
Come on.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.282
How have you been?

40:24.663 --> 40:27.459
You'd know if you
were around, but...

40:27.494 --> 40:29.806
You're always up here.

40:29.841 --> 40:31.739
Coloring or

40:31.774 --> 40:35.398
you know, running around
with that church girl.

40:36.606 --> 40:39.437
I haven't seen her in a while.

40:39.471 --> 40:41.162
Did you rob her blind already?

40:41.197 --> 40:43.026
You don't know
anything about her.

40:43.061 --> 40:45.995
Oh, Jordan. C'mon. Really?

40:47.341 --> 40:50.965
You know she can dress like us,
she can act like us,

40:51.000 --> 40:54.175
but she will never be like us!

40:54.210 --> 40:56.488
I know that type. Yeah?

40:56.523 --> 40:59.353
Her parents bail her out...

40:59.387 --> 41:02.977
Right? Yeah, her life
is so fucking easy.

41:03.012 --> 41:07.706
Like us? There is no "us".
I'm nothing like you!

41:07.741 --> 41:08.914
Whoa!

41:08.949 --> 41:11.365
Leave, Misty!

41:11.399 --> 41:14.437
OK! Chill out, dude!

41:14.472 --> 41:18.061
Did I just, like, insult
your fucking princess?

41:18.096 --> 41:19.477
You know, hey,
have you noticed her?

41:19.511 --> 41:21.168
She has like some, um

41:21.202 --> 41:25.172
speech impediment, you know?
She talks like this.

41:25.206 --> 41:26.622
Yeah, she sounds like
a fucking retard!

41:26.656 --> 41:28.900
Get out! Why can't you
just ever leave?

41:28.934 --> 41:31.868
No, you get out!
You get the fuck out of my roof!

41:31.903 --> 41:33.836
- It's not your fucking roof.
- No! Yeah!

41:33.870 --> 41:37.356
I don't give a shit! OK?

41:44.398 --> 41:47.850
You've always been
a fucking loser.

41:47.884 --> 41:52.855
You quit, quit, quit!
Quit, quit, quit, quit!

41:52.889 --> 41:54.581
That's what you do!

41:54.615 --> 41:57.480
That's the only thing
you know what to do. OK?

41:57.515 --> 42:00.207
And she knows that.
She pities you.

42:00.241 --> 42:03.693
She loves me.
And I love her.

42:08.387 --> 42:10.217
Where's my money?

42:10.251 --> 42:11.736
I'm getting it.

42:44.009 --> 42:45.355
You're out, OK?

42:45.390 --> 42:48.945
I don't give a fuck about your stupid little shit drawings!

42:48.980 --> 42:52.190
All this fucking shit!
I don't give a shit!

42:52.224 --> 42:54.157
Get the fuck out!

42:54.192 --> 42:56.608
I want my money tonight.
If not...

42:56.643 --> 42:59.266
this whole thing's
gonna go out. OK?

42:59.300 --> 43:03.753
You understand?
Fuck you!

43:04.892 --> 43:07.826
They're taking me apart
piece by piece, Mom.

43:07.861 --> 43:10.311
- When I die--
- No, don't say that.

43:10.346 --> 43:12.555
It's irreversible, mom.

43:12.590 --> 43:15.385
When it happens,
it can't be here.

43:15.420 --> 43:17.595
Promise me it won't be here!

43:17.629 --> 43:20.080
They're doing everything that they can.
I promise you that.

43:20.114 --> 43:21.357
Promise her it won't be
here, Mom.

43:21.391 --> 43:22.807
Bailey!

43:22.841 --> 43:26.120
Morgan, I promise you
I won't let anyone keep you here

43:26.155 --> 43:29.227
one second longer than you
want to be, alright?

43:29.261 --> 43:30.815
Should we step outside?

43:30.849 --> 43:33.749
No, this is about me!
I want to hear it!

43:45.208 --> 43:46.865
- They can't.
- Take me home!

43:46.900 --> 43:49.972
I hear they can manage your pain much
better than we can at home, baby.

43:50.006 --> 43:51.594
Take me home! Bailey?

43:51.629 --> 43:52.768
We're going home.

43:52.802 --> 43:55.529
No, Bailey! Just let us
think. OK?

43:56.668 --> 44:02.778
Please, whatever time I
have left. Let me have it.

44:21.417 --> 44:23.039
Why didn't my key work?

44:23.074 --> 44:26.733
Probably because Misty
changed the locks.

44:26.767 --> 44:28.044
Why?

44:29.114 --> 44:30.771
To keep Jordan out.

44:30.806 --> 44:31.703
I'm Jordan.

44:31.738 --> 44:34.568
Not today princess.

44:34.602 --> 44:36.018
What are you talking about?

44:37.571 --> 44:39.538
So I take it that
this is the hive,

44:39.573 --> 44:42.162
and I'm like
one of the guardian bees.

44:42.196 --> 44:44.164
How big is my stinger?

44:44.198 --> 44:48.133
The dragonfly boy was led
into the Queen's palace.

44:48.168 --> 44:52.206
She looked the dragonfly boy
up and down and said

44:52.241 --> 44:54.692
"What hive are you from?"

44:54.726 --> 44:58.523
"I am a prince from a hive
deep in the northern forest,

44:58.557 --> 45:00.663
so deep you probably
never heard of it".

45:00.698 --> 45:05.633
"I am the queen! I heard of
every hive worth hearing about!

45:05.668 --> 45:10.017
Tell me, young prince. Is your
land rich in honey?"

45:10.052 --> 45:12.951
"Yes, My hive is
full of honey."

45:12.986 --> 45:16.506
The queen's eyes light up
with a greedy golden glow.

45:16.541 --> 45:21.063
"Then I will be twice as rich!
Bring out the princess!"

45:21.097 --> 45:25.032
The bee guards open a
honeycombed door.

45:25.067 --> 45:28.795
There stands the beautiful
princess bee.

45:28.829 --> 45:32.074
Her eyes meet the
dragonfly boy's eyes.

45:32.108 --> 45:34.801
"You are the strangest bee
I have ever seen,

45:34.835 --> 45:38.977
but I can see in your eyes,
that you are a kind prince."

45:39.012 --> 45:42.532
The dragonfly boy, more happy
than he has ever been,

45:42.567 --> 45:45.535
embraces his beloved
princess bee.

45:45.570 --> 45:47.227
And even though it was
quite romantic,

45:47.261 --> 45:52.197
the dragonfly boy knew he had just fallen into a very sticky situation.

45:52.232 --> 45:55.925
The princess bee became
stuck to the dragonfly boy

45:55.960 --> 45:59.342
just like all the
other bees before her.

46:00.550 --> 46:03.657
The queen bee was outraged!

47:12.450 --> 47:14.659
What are you doing?

47:32.884 --> 47:34.852
Go back to sleep.

48:57.624 --> 48:58.866
Brings out your eyes.

48:59.729 --> 49:02.008
What the hell
are you doing here?

49:02.042 --> 49:03.975
Morgan, is everything okay?

49:04.010 --> 49:08.186
Yeah, it's just a spider.
I captured it!

49:08.221 --> 49:10.499
Okay, I'll be downstairs
if you need me.

49:10.533 --> 49:12.121
I'm fine, Mom!

49:15.159 --> 49:16.401
I missed you.

49:18.231 --> 49:20.267
We can't do this.

49:20.302 --> 49:21.889
It's not fair.

49:21.924 --> 49:23.305
Life's not fair.

49:23.961 --> 49:25.583
It's not good for you.

49:25.617 --> 49:27.309
And it's not good for me.

49:27.343 --> 49:29.104
I'm not good for anyone.
How does that matter?

49:29.138 --> 49:32.383
I like you.
That's how it matters.

49:33.694 --> 49:36.766
I don't want you
to see me like this.

49:36.801 --> 49:39.459
Are you kidding?
I like this new look.

49:39.493 --> 49:42.807
It's very anarchist. It's sexy.

49:44.464 --> 49:48.192
No. I mean...

49:48.226 --> 49:52.713
I don't want you to
see what happens to me.

49:52.748 --> 49:55.164
I want you to remember me

49:55.199 --> 49:57.339
when I was me.

49:57.373 --> 49:58.996
I'm falling apart.

49:59.789 --> 50:02.620
We're all falling apart, Morgan.

50:02.654 --> 50:04.001
It's the nature of this world.

50:04.035 --> 50:07.625
Please, just go away.

50:07.659 --> 50:09.006
I am going away. I just

50:09.040 --> 50:10.455
came here to see if
you wanted to come with.

50:10.490 --> 50:12.802
You can't just run from
what's coming to me.

50:12.837 --> 50:14.321
You can always run.

50:14.356 --> 50:17.048
It may catch you,
but we can always run.

50:17.083 --> 50:19.947
Make that fucker chase you down,
instead of just rolling over

50:19.982 --> 50:21.328
waiting for it.

50:21.363 --> 50:23.020
You don't get it.

50:25.953 --> 50:28.094
Please, leave.

50:28.784 --> 50:31.304
And don't come back.

50:31.338 --> 50:35.894
We won't recognize
each other if you do.

50:35.929 --> 50:37.931
I'm not leaving you.

50:37.965 --> 50:40.140
I don't want you here!

50:41.590 --> 50:43.316
Do you get that?

50:45.042 --> 50:49.046
I don't want to
know you anymore.

50:51.013 --> 50:52.877
Leave or I'll scream.

51:02.956 --> 51:06.408
- You're not dead yet, Morgan.
- I am dead.

51:06.442 --> 51:10.584
Your story ends with "She dies,
the end." Trust me!

51:10.619 --> 51:13.484
You should use your brain
while you still have it.

51:13.518 --> 51:14.657
I'll be waiting.

51:17.591 --> 51:23.252
♪ Drive baby drive,
until your trouble's gone ♪

51:27.222 --> 51:34.988
♪ Run, baby, run,
until it all goes numb ♪

51:39.475 --> 51:43.376
♪ You are the wind,
the flood and the flame ♪

51:43.410 --> 51:45.447
♪ Nothing here
can get in your way ♪

51:45.481 --> 51:49.865
♪ You've come too far to
care what they say ♪

51:49.899 --> 51:52.937
♪ Now you're the only
thing in your way ♪

51:58.908 --> 52:01.187
♪ Now you're the only
thing in your way ♪

52:06.192 --> 52:14.061
♪ Fly, baby, fly,
until nothing can get you down... ♪

52:18.065 --> 52:20.171
Told you. Not sexy.

52:20.206 --> 52:22.242
Jordan, tell them what
you were doing this whole time.

52:22.277 --> 52:23.623
I was waiting for you.

52:23.657 --> 52:24.658
Tell them!

52:24.693 --> 52:25.832
Fine.

52:25.866 --> 52:28.869
So I was all dressed up
and had nowhere to go.

52:28.904 --> 52:31.907
So, that's exactly where
I went. Nowhere.

52:31.941 --> 52:33.943
And when you're nowhere
in life

52:33.978 --> 52:36.325
that's where bad shit
happens.

52:36.360 --> 52:40.295
Well, well, well.

52:40.329 --> 52:41.434
Look who's here.

52:41.468 --> 52:42.607
Misty?

52:42.642 --> 52:43.919
This him?

52:49.959 --> 52:51.685
Muscolo!

52:52.824 --> 52:55.620
Introduce yourself.

52:55.655 --> 52:58.002
Shame. He was pretty too.

52:58.036 --> 52:59.314
Misty, what is this?

53:02.351 --> 53:05.216
Hey, hey, hey!
Come here! Come here!

53:05.251 --> 53:06.321
Where's my money?

53:06.355 --> 53:08.115
Jordan, just give them
the money!

53:08.150 --> 53:11.567
- Come out and play!
- No! No! Aah!

53:13.293 --> 53:16.123
- No! No, no!
- Listen to me. Listen.

53:16.158 --> 53:17.918
I think you're confused.

53:17.953 --> 53:22.958
I'm not some pinché puto selling pastelitos on the street, man.

53:22.992 --> 53:26.789
I'm a business man. Yeah.

53:26.824 --> 53:31.415
And you interfered
with my business.

53:32.347 --> 53:35.419
Now, I have to call my friend.

53:37.559 --> 53:38.629
This one here.

53:41.632 --> 53:44.013
Say you don't have the money.
Say it.

53:44.048 --> 53:47.500
Say "I don't have the money".

53:47.534 --> 53:52.746
- Say it. Say it! Say it!
- Wait, wait! I don't!

53:52.781 --> 53:55.542
- I don't have all of it!
- Say it!

53:55.577 --> 53:57.889
I just only have part of
it. I smoked most of it.

53:57.924 --> 53:59.753
Oh you smoked my money!

53:59.788 --> 54:02.894
No, he's not lying!

54:02.929 --> 54:04.724
But just like that, yes?

54:06.691 --> 54:08.383
Hey no, man! C'mon!

54:11.972 --> 54:13.491
Hit him again!

54:18.807 --> 54:22.431
Shaddup! I say when it's enough!
Gucho says when it's enough!

54:22.466 --> 54:23.467
Shaddup!

54:24.088 --> 54:25.883
Listen to me.

54:25.917 --> 54:27.919
Listen to me, pretty face.

54:27.954 --> 54:31.129
I'm gonna give you two days.
OK?

54:31.164 --> 54:36.825
One, two days to give me
my money

54:36.859 --> 54:38.136
All my money.

54:38.171 --> 54:39.862
You can decide to run away.

54:39.897 --> 54:43.728
You can go far to whatever
you want. The Bahamas, surfing!

54:43.763 --> 54:46.006
Whatever the fuck you want!

54:46.041 --> 54:47.456
But I'm gonna find you.

54:47.491 --> 54:50.425
I'm gonna cut your little dickie
right there.

54:51.736 --> 54:56.085
I'm gonna make a burrito.
I'm gonna eat it.

54:56.120 --> 54:58.225
And then, I'm gonna kill you.

54:58.260 --> 54:59.537
You understand?

54:59.572 --> 55:02.229
What the hell is going on here?

55:02.264 --> 55:03.541
None of your business.

55:03.576 --> 55:04.853
This is my business.

55:04.887 --> 55:07.304
Oh, and this is my gun!

55:11.894 --> 55:13.275
Listen man,

55:13.310 --> 55:16.796
We caught this piece of shit
stealing purses from your club.

55:16.830 --> 55:19.074
We were doing your job.

55:19.108 --> 55:22.180
I don't like doing your job.
I got my own job!

55:22.215 --> 55:24.321
That doesn't make me happy!

55:25.149 --> 55:26.461
Not happy about that!

55:26.495 --> 55:29.187
Misty? You have your purse?

55:29.222 --> 55:32.363
Hey! Grab yours? Vamanos!

55:34.676 --> 55:35.780
Vamos!

55:35.815 --> 55:37.472
Adios.

55:43.305 --> 55:44.824
Keep walking.

55:52.383 --> 55:54.351
Don't come back here.

56:27.556 --> 56:30.904
Just wondering when
you'd be coming back for those.

56:33.528 --> 56:35.495
You knew these were
under your bed?

56:35.530 --> 56:38.774
Took me less than five minutes
to find them.

56:53.824 --> 56:57.034
What happened to your face?

56:57.068 --> 56:59.001
Someone broke my heart

56:59.036 --> 57:01.314
and it spread to my face.

57:01.348 --> 57:03.385
I missed you.

57:15.259 --> 57:16.916
I missed you too.

57:17.986 --> 57:19.919
I missed you too.

57:24.993 --> 57:26.891
Follow me.

57:44.564 --> 57:46.877
Wait! What are you doing?

57:46.911 --> 57:48.395
I want to be with you.

57:48.430 --> 57:50.363
I want to live with you.
I want to look like you.

57:50.397 --> 57:51.951
Everything.

57:52.710 --> 57:53.918
You can't, I'm...

57:53.953 --> 57:56.403
I don't care how much
time we have together.

57:56.438 --> 58:00.994
Dragonflies only live for three months and look how happy they are.

58:01.029 --> 58:02.962
How do you know they're happy?

58:03.997 --> 58:06.448
Have you ever heard of
a depressed dragonfly?

58:08.277 --> 58:09.486
No.

58:16.182 --> 58:18.529
Are you sure about this?

58:18.564 --> 58:21.359
This might be a
very stupid idea.

58:21.394 --> 58:22.913
Let's just be stupid.

58:23.914 --> 58:26.088
Make it so that no one
can tell us apart.

Keep it down, Mom and
Dad will hear you!

59:42.509 --> 59:44.339
But they sent me up
to wake you up.

59:44.373 --> 59:46.444
They know he's here?

59:48.170 --> 59:49.758
Who lit your face up?

59:49.793 --> 59:50.621
Your sister did.

59:50.656 --> 59:52.312
She's a wild animal
in the sack.

59:52.347 --> 59:53.555
Shut up!

59:53.590 --> 59:54.970
Tell them all I'll
be right down.

59:55.005 --> 59:57.007
Mom wants to know if
your guest will be

59:57.041 --> 59:58.595
staying for breakfast.

59:58.629 --> 01:00:02.046
Tell your Mom and Dad
that I'm starving.

01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:06.948
This is gonna be interesting.

01:00:10.296 --> 01:00:11.642
- Hey Bailey?
- Yeah?

01:00:11.677 --> 01:00:13.471
What do you think
of my new look?

01:00:13.506 --> 01:00:16.060
You two look like a couple of
badass GI Janes.

01:00:16.095 --> 01:00:18.753
Ooh Rah!

01:00:19.823 --> 01:00:21.687
Hey Morgan,

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.656
I need to leave town for a bit.

01:00:25.691 --> 01:00:28.452
Haven't we been
down this road already?

01:00:28.486 --> 01:00:30.454
We stay off the roads.

01:00:30.488 --> 01:00:34.044
We have wings. Let's use them.

01:00:34.078 --> 01:00:35.528
Come with me.

01:00:36.253 --> 01:00:39.221
I'm not a dragonfly, Jordan.

01:00:39.256 --> 01:00:40.844
Look.

01:00:40.878 --> 01:00:43.260
I know it sucks that
your brain is sick.

01:00:43.294 --> 01:00:45.538
And fuck God or

01:00:45.572 --> 01:00:48.679
life or whatever, whoever it
is that did this to you.

01:00:48.714 --> 01:00:51.958
But it doesn't have to
be miserable.

01:00:51.993 --> 01:00:55.721
We can do anything we ever
wanted to right now.

01:00:55.755 --> 01:00:59.241
Like what? What can I do?

01:00:59.276 --> 01:01:04.419
You wanna travel, we can.
You wanna go skydiving, we can.

01:01:04.453 --> 01:01:06.732
Steal a car, rob a bank.
Swim with a turtle.

01:01:06.766 --> 01:01:10.839
I don't care what the plan is.
We don't have to wait.

01:01:10.874 --> 01:01:14.740
We have money and time,
let's spend them both together.

01:01:19.468 --> 01:01:23.334
I've always imagined
that one day

01:01:23.369 --> 01:01:27.407
I'd be wearing a
white vintage dress,

01:01:27.442 --> 01:01:29.444
my hair would be up,

01:01:29.478 --> 01:01:32.309
and my family
would all be crying,

01:01:32.343 --> 01:01:33.620
off to the side,

01:01:33.655 --> 01:01:35.277
with flowers everywhere.

01:01:37.486 --> 01:01:39.523
Now my hair is gone

01:01:39.557 --> 01:01:42.837
and my family will cry
for a different reason

01:01:44.079 --> 01:01:45.805
Morgan Gandara,

01:01:46.633 --> 01:01:49.188
my dragonfly boy,

01:01:51.328 --> 01:01:53.295
will you marry me?

01:01:55.677 --> 01:01:57.437
My brain could just
stop working.

01:01:57.472 --> 01:01:59.163
I can die tomorrow,
we all can.

01:01:59.198 --> 01:02:02.166
There's no line to wait in.
It just happens.

01:02:02.201 --> 01:02:04.790
You're serious, aren't you?

01:02:04.824 --> 01:02:08.690
Try to answer me by
asking another question.

01:02:10.002 --> 01:02:12.073
Yes?

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:22.773
So, Jordan, that looks like it
was a pretty nasty fall.

01:02:22.808 --> 01:02:25.569
Thirty-seven steps,
hit every one.

01:02:25.603 --> 01:02:28.054
Must've really
pissed off the staircase.

01:02:29.815 --> 01:02:33.991
Dennis and I were saying how much we liked your new haircut.

01:02:34.026 --> 01:02:36.166
No, I never said
anything like that.

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:40.791
Mom, I'm quitting piano.
It's getting too difficult.

01:02:40.826 --> 01:02:44.553
Okay.
I'll call Mrs. Randall today.

01:02:44.588 --> 01:02:46.107
Jordan, I didn't hear you
come in last night.

01:02:46.141 --> 01:02:47.971
Did you knock or just
creep up the back steps?

01:02:48.005 --> 01:02:49.973
- I let him in, Dad.
- What time was that?

01:02:50.007 --> 01:02:54.322
I thought you retired
from being a detective?

01:02:54.356 --> 01:02:56.738
We're getting married.

01:02:57.843 --> 01:02:59.016
Huh?

01:02:59.637 --> 01:03:02.054
Just like that, huh?

01:03:02.088 --> 01:03:04.332
Wow, this is awesome.

01:03:04.366 --> 01:03:05.851
We're in love.

01:03:07.853 --> 01:03:10.994
Under different circumstances,
the way I would approach this

01:03:11.028 --> 01:03:13.720
would be to ask
the both of you first

01:03:13.755 --> 01:03:17.138
but we're running against
the clock here.

01:03:17.172 --> 01:03:18.864
Moe...

01:03:19.623 --> 01:03:21.107
You hardly know this boy.

01:03:21.142 --> 01:03:23.558
How long did you know Mom
before you guys got married?

01:03:23.592 --> 01:03:25.111
That's a completely
different story.

01:03:25.146 --> 01:03:27.389
It is and it isn't.

01:03:27.424 --> 01:03:31.186
When'd you plan on having
this wedding? And where?

01:03:31.221 --> 01:03:32.498
Right here.

01:03:32.532 --> 01:03:34.051
Tomorrow?

01:03:34.569 --> 01:03:35.742
This is insane.

01:03:35.777 --> 01:03:37.917
I think it's a great idea.

01:03:40.471 --> 01:03:44.199
Morgan? This is what you want?

01:03:45.614 --> 01:03:48.169
This is all I have ever wanted.

01:03:54.796 --> 01:03:56.660
My sister is ordained.

01:03:56.694 --> 01:03:59.249
Yes! Aunt Lisa can marry us!

01:04:00.422 --> 01:04:01.665
Dennis?

01:04:21.305 --> 01:04:23.031
Congratulations.

01:04:31.453 --> 01:04:34.387
Score! I'm gonna
have two sisters!

01:04:34.422 --> 01:04:39.668
Uh, hey Dad...

01:04:39.703 --> 01:04:42.637
- Do you think I can borrow--
- Already?

01:04:42.671 --> 01:04:44.190
Seriously?

01:04:45.709 --> 01:04:51.508
Unless you have two vintage wedding dresses hanging in the closet.

01:04:51.542 --> 01:04:53.096

to strip the honey-glued
bees off of the dragonfly boy.

they were pulled off his body until standing there,

01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:22.803
he was just the
dragonfly boy.

fool me!"

their stingers

01:14:32.329 --> 01:14:34.193
and approached

01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:43.686

01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:45.619
"Look how colorful
his wings are!"

01:14:45.653 --> 01:14:48.829
The princess bee approaches
the dragonfly boy.

01:14:48.863 --> 01:14:51.314
"What are you?"

01:14:51.348 --> 01:14:52.971
"What do you mean, what am I?"

01:14:53.005 --> 01:14:55.007
"Are you a dragonfly?"

01:14:55.042 --> 01:14:56.664
"Yes"

01:14:56.699 --> 01:14:59.322
The princess bee
examines his wings,

01:14:59.356 --> 01:15:02.394
his body, and his eyes.

01:15:02.428 --> 01:15:06.156

so beautiful before."

bee-longs with a bee!"

01:15:09.884 --> 01:15:11.092

01:15:11.127 --> 01:15:12.922
"Says me! I am the queen!"

01:15:12.956 --> 01:15:14.406
The royal bumble bee guards,

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:18.375
armed with their sharp stingers begin to march toward the two lovers.

01:15:18.410 --> 01:15:20.274
"Are dragonflies fast?"

01:15:20.308 --> 01:15:22.448
"Yes, much faster than bees"

01:15:22.483 --> 01:15:23.588
And at that very moment,

01:15:23.622 --> 01:15:26.383
the princess bee hops
onto the dragonfly boy,

01:15:26.418 --> 01:15:28.385
holds him tightly, and says

01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:29.904
"Let's flyaway together"

01:15:30.698 --> 01:15:32.631
He flutters his wings rapidly

01:15:32.666 --> 01:15:34.426
as they lift off the ground,

01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:35.807
and just like that,

01:15:35.841 --> 01:15:38.672
the two lovers race
across through the air

01:15:38.706 --> 01:15:41.640

Queen's Bee's castle.

01:18:10.375 --> 01:18:12.584
Take me!

01:18:14.413 --> 01:18:17.037
Go! Take me! Don't take
my little girl!

01:18:17.071 --> 01:18:21.869
- Is that what you want me to--
- Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

01:18:21.904 --> 01:18:24.078
Oh my god!

01:18:24.113 --> 01:18:25.597
No...

01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:30.706
I can't stop fighting.

01:18:31.983 --> 01:18:34.088
Do you remember her
fifth birthday?

01:18:35.745 --> 01:18:38.023
She just wanted a brother.

01:18:39.438 --> 01:18:41.026
Hm, you remember that?

01:18:41.061 --> 01:18:47.136
Didn't want a pony, no bike.
No, no dolls. Just a brother.

01:18:47.170 --> 01:18:52.175
She was such a
smart little five year old.

01:18:52.210 --> 01:18:55.316
She wanted a brother because

01:18:55.351 --> 01:18:57.318
As she grew up

01:18:57.353 --> 01:18:59.873
She didn't want us to be lonely.

01:19:02.151 --> 01:19:04.670
Oh, Dennis...

01:19:08.709 --> 01:19:13.024
I can't live without
my little girl.

01:19:14.404 --> 01:19:17.407
- I can't live without--
- You have to.

01:19:17.442 --> 01:19:19.927
You have to.

01:19:19.962 --> 01:19:22.930
I just wanna put her back inside me.
- I know, I know.

01:19:22.965 --> 01:19:26.658
I can start all over again.
Put her back inside me.

01:19:26.692 --> 01:19:28.764
You're almost done fighting.

01:20:07.837 --> 01:20:10.357
Beautiful, isn't it?

01:20:14.982 --> 01:20:17.847
The most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

01:20:20.885 --> 01:20:26.269
Let's do something
I've never done before.

01:20:26.304 --> 01:20:27.684
Something bad.

01:20:27.719 --> 01:20:29.721
I'm always good.

01:20:30.722 --> 01:20:33.069
What's bad but not cruel?

01:20:38.247 --> 01:20:40.318
Can you run?

01:20:41.284 --> 01:20:44.149
I can't. I can woddle.

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:47.014
Woddle. What's woddle?

01:20:47.946 --> 01:20:52.157
You know, limp away at
a medium pace.

01:20:52.192 --> 01:20:53.987
Like a penguin.

01:21:00.131 --> 01:21:02.167
Okay, here's the plan.

01:21:02.202 --> 01:21:03.789
You're going to be my
lookout, got it?

01:21:03.824 --> 01:21:06.620
Crap that! We go in together
or not at all.

01:21:06.654 --> 01:21:08.380
Crap that?

01:21:08.415 --> 01:21:10.037
Fine.

01:21:10.072 --> 01:21:14.145
But just stick close to me and yell
whatever Spanish words you know, okay?

01:21:14.179 --> 01:21:15.215
Si.

01:21:18.528 --> 01:21:20.358
What's this for?

01:21:20.392 --> 01:21:22.394
That is your gun.

01:21:24.086 --> 01:21:26.226
Don't worry, it's not loaded.

01:21:30.575 --> 01:21:31.817
- C'mon!
- OK.

01:21:33.612 --> 01:21:35.821
Hello, welcome.

01:21:36.857 --> 01:21:38.928
Gimme all the money
in the register, cabron!

01:21:38.963 --> 01:21:41.586
We're outlaw bandits with
nothing to lose, grandpa!

01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:45.486
- Spanish.
- Oh. Hola, amigo. Señor bandits!

01:21:46.694 --> 01:21:48.558
Don't try anything stupid,
old man.

01:21:48.593 --> 01:21:49.801
Yeah because where we are from,

01:21:49.835 --> 01:21:51.147
we don't take prisoners.

01:21:51.182 --> 01:21:54.564
And we leave no witnesses!
Except for this time, with you.

01:21:54.599 --> 01:21:56.083
Oh, I messed that up didn't I?

01:21:56.118 --> 01:21:57.982
No, you were great.
He probably pissed his pants.

01:21:58.016 --> 01:21:58.948
Seriously?

01:21:58.983 --> 01:22:00.674
Yeah. He hit the silent alarm,
let's go.

01:22:00.708 --> 01:22:02.055
Damn coppers!

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:06.749
Gracias, mi amigo!

01:22:11.443 --> 01:22:12.479
Come here!

01:22:13.825 --> 01:22:15.033
Much faster!

01:22:28.771 --> 01:22:30.014
Stay down!

01:22:30.048 --> 01:22:33.189
That was so bad. We're like
wanted fugitives now!

01:22:33.224 --> 01:22:36.330
You called us outlaw bandits?
Who says that?

01:22:36.365 --> 01:22:38.401
Outlaw bandits do.

01:22:39.747 --> 01:22:41.059
We hit the jackpot!

01:22:41.094 --> 01:22:43.613
There's like
450 bucks here.

01:22:43.648 --> 01:22:46.375
Yay. What's next?

01:22:47.893 --> 01:22:49.585
You've got to me kidding me.

01:22:53.934 --> 01:22:56.005
How you holding up?

01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:57.973
Mmhmm.

01:22:58.628 --> 01:23:00.009
Doesn't that hurt?

01:23:00.044 --> 01:23:02.391
Of course it hurts.

01:23:02.425 --> 01:23:04.910
But I like pain now.

01:23:07.327 --> 01:23:08.949
How does it look?

01:23:10.054 --> 01:23:12.021
It looks just like you.

01:23:13.747 --> 01:23:15.404
How does it look?

01:23:17.785 --> 01:23:19.891
It looks just like you.

01:23:19.925 --> 01:23:21.548
I like your smile.

01:23:28.417 --> 01:23:32.766
♪ Zombie Apocalypse,
yeah!♪♪

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:34.940
You know, you really
shouldn't be driving.

01:23:34.975 --> 01:23:37.150
I do things I shouldn't do now.

01:23:41.775 --> 01:23:43.915
What's wrong?

01:23:43.949 --> 01:23:46.952
I can't, um.

01:23:47.608 --> 01:23:49.093
Put it in D.

01:23:49.127 --> 01:23:51.129
- I can't.
- You sure you are okay to drive?

01:23:51.164 --> 01:23:54.857
- I don't, can't promise I...
- Morgan, your hands.

01:23:54.891 --> 01:23:58.067
- I promise I...
- Morgan, are you alright?

01:23:58.102 --> 01:23:59.344
Morgan!

01:24:00.759 --> 01:24:03.417
Morgan! Morgan!

01:24:05.937 --> 01:24:09.251
It's okay! Morgan!
Come on! It's okay!

01:24:09.285 --> 01:24:10.838
Morgan. Morgan!

01:24:10.873 --> 01:24:13.703
Is this seriously the first time you've seen a horror movie?

01:24:13.738 --> 01:24:15.740
Shut up!
He's about to get slaughtered!

01:24:15.774 --> 01:24:17.190
How are you not scared?

01:24:17.224 --> 01:24:21.504
I'm a rebel.
I'm not scared of anything anymore.

01:24:26.268 --> 01:24:29.719
I know what I want
to do tomorrow.

01:24:29.754 --> 01:24:31.480
What's that?

01:24:31.514 --> 01:24:33.137
See Mom.

01:24:35.622 --> 01:24:37.520
Want to go home tomorrow?

01:24:37.555 --> 01:24:40.523
Not my home, not my Mom.

01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:58.127
I haven't been here in 13 years.

01:24:58.162 --> 01:25:00.957
That's my favorite number.

01:25:09.794 --> 01:25:11.347
Fred?

01:25:13.867 --> 01:25:15.593
It's me.

01:25:15.627 --> 01:25:17.215
Who's me?

01:25:17.250 --> 01:25:19.079
Your son.

01:25:24.326 --> 01:25:27.570
I, I just didn't hear.
That's all.

01:25:29.676 --> 01:25:32.161
I know you're my son.

01:25:46.624 --> 01:25:48.729
- Hi Mom.
- Hey.

01:25:55.667 --> 01:25:59.671
Uh, this is Morgan.
My wife.

01:26:01.121 --> 01:26:03.123
You got a wife.

01:26:06.954 --> 01:26:10.717
It's, it's nice to meet you.

01:26:17.862 --> 01:26:19.691
What should I call you?

01:26:19.726 --> 01:26:23.178
Alice. No, call me uh, Momma.

01:26:24.903 --> 01:26:28.528
He, he used to
always call me Mom.

01:26:28.562 --> 01:26:31.324
Uh, Morgan and I
were on our honeymoon

01:26:32.290 --> 01:26:37.295
And she, she wanted to meet you.

01:26:38.123 --> 01:26:40.022
Hey, who's Fred?

01:26:40.056 --> 01:26:42.956
Oh never mind Fred.

01:26:42.990 --> 01:26:45.648
I just want to look at you.

01:26:46.822 --> 01:26:48.444
Okay.

01:26:54.933 --> 01:26:57.488
You look so much
like your father.

01:26:58.730 --> 01:27:00.698
How would you know that?

01:27:01.975 --> 01:27:03.632
I hope you're nothing like him.

01:27:03.666 --> 01:27:05.737
His Daddy was a thief.

01:27:05.772 --> 01:27:07.498
Mom, my Dad was a Chief.

01:27:07.532 --> 01:27:11.329
Yeah he was a Chief, alright.
Chief talking bull.

01:27:14.781 --> 01:27:16.714
Who drew those?

01:27:18.129 --> 01:27:20.545
He did them all.

01:27:21.305 --> 01:27:23.445
Jordy was artistic.

01:27:24.963 --> 01:27:27.138
They're wonderful.

01:27:27.172 --> 01:27:29.209
Oh, never mind the pictures.

01:27:35.146 --> 01:27:37.493
Hey you all must be starving.

01:27:37.528 --> 01:27:39.737
I swear,
the moment I saw you walk in

01:27:39.771 --> 01:27:43.603
I thought the both of you were a couple of strays begging for scraps.

01:27:45.501 --> 01:27:48.849
We get a lot of
strays around here.

01:27:48.884 --> 01:27:53.785
Mostly cats and dogs,
but I defeated a coyote not too long back.

01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:56.271
Must've been hit by a car.

01:27:56.305 --> 01:27:58.203
Up on the highway.

01:27:58.238 --> 01:28:02.104
Well, we're not a
couple of strays.

01:28:02.138 --> 01:28:04.796
But we're a couple of
hungry rebels.

01:28:06.039 --> 01:28:08.110
There you go, Ted the Turtle.

01:28:08.973 --> 01:28:10.906
I got some chicken in the foot.

01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:12.666
Chicken in the foot?

01:28:12.701 --> 01:28:14.150
Don't ask.

01:28:14.185 --> 01:28:16.705
I call the fridge the foot.

01:28:16.739 --> 01:28:18.776
Remember why, Jordy?

01:28:19.639 --> 01:28:20.640
Nope.

01:28:21.261 --> 01:28:22.366
You sassy, boy.

01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:25.955
When you,
when he was a little kid,

01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:28.958
he'd point to the
fridge and say foot.

01:28:28.993 --> 01:28:30.822
M-meaning food.

01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:36.311
"Mama, foot!"

01:28:38.036 --> 01:28:41.419
Doctors thought he had a speech
impediment, but he showed them!

01:28:41.454 --> 01:28:44.146
- Didn't you, Jordy?
- Yup.

01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:45.837
That's cute.

01:28:46.976 --> 01:28:50.325
It's cold,
but I like it cold.

01:28:50.359 --> 01:28:52.637
Jordy always ate it cold.

01:28:54.121 --> 01:28:55.433
You want me to heat it up?

01:28:55.468 --> 01:28:58.229
Oh, no. Cold feet is fine.

01:29:07.963 --> 01:29:10.345
I'm just so happy.

01:29:10.379 --> 01:29:12.381
I can't tell you.

01:29:13.486 --> 01:29:16.799
Knowing that he's finally
doing something.

01:29:18.629 --> 01:29:21.666
- He's getting married.
- Mom, please.

01:29:21.701 --> 01:29:23.875
Oh don't be such a girl.

01:29:26.361 --> 01:29:29.778
Had to make sure that,
you were a girl.

01:29:29.812 --> 01:29:30.537
Mom.

01:29:31.124 --> 01:29:32.574
Oh come on, Jordy!

01:29:33.609 --> 01:29:36.474
We had quite the scare
when he was a child.

01:29:36.509 --> 01:29:40.064
Playing all by himself
with dolls like a little girl.

01:29:40.098 --> 01:29:43.412
Drawing these pretty pictures
and all, and the other boys

01:29:43.447 --> 01:29:46.173
are playing sports,
and fighting

01:29:46.208 --> 01:29:47.830
but Jordy, no

01:29:49.004 --> 01:29:52.766
He was inside, hiding

01:29:52.801 --> 01:29:54.906
In my clothes sometimes.

01:29:58.738 --> 01:30:04.053
Then in school getting kicked
out for messing around with, Oh!

01:30:04.088 --> 01:30:05.952
With another boy.

01:30:07.781 --> 01:30:12.061
And I knew it was just
kids and their wonderin's

01:30:12.096 --> 01:30:13.960
after they beat him
half to death and back,

01:30:13.994 --> 01:30:16.411
I told him to take off,
and he did.

01:30:20.553 --> 01:30:26.110
Now look at him, he's all
grown up like a man.

01:30:26.144 --> 01:30:29.389
I still play with dolls.

01:30:30.494 --> 01:30:33.117
I still wear women's clothing
when I want to.

01:30:33.151 --> 01:30:36.810
Jordan. It's okay.

01:30:36.845 --> 01:30:42.885
I just wanted to see where the princess bee came from.
We can go.

01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:48.443
Jordy, you can't be a pansy
and have a wife.

01:30:50.410 --> 01:30:54.034
I mean, God ain't fooled.
She maybe, but

01:30:56.036 --> 01:30:57.831
God isn't.

01:31:05.425 --> 01:31:08.566
It was nice to meet you, Alice.

01:31:09.429 --> 01:31:11.535
The queen bee.

01:31:11.569 --> 01:31:13.260
Queen bee?

01:31:13.295 --> 01:31:16.540
I like that.

01:31:16.574 --> 01:31:20.647
Mom, here.
Here's a...

01:31:29.276 --> 01:31:31.071
I'll get you something.

01:31:32.487 --> 01:31:35.075
After all it was y'all
that got married, not me.

01:31:53.508 --> 01:31:57.546
Woo hoo!

01:32:01.964 --> 01:32:03.103
A knife?

01:32:03.138 --> 01:32:05.692
Yes, It's a letter opener.

01:32:05.727 --> 01:32:08.523
I won it at Hoolie Hoop stop
last week.

01:32:11.008 --> 01:32:12.492
Probably cheap,

01:32:12.527 --> 01:32:16.461
but I got no use for it.
Nobody writes me any mail.

01:32:18.774 --> 01:32:20.673
Thanks, Mom.

01:32:20.707 --> 01:32:22.502
I love you.

01:32:25.022 --> 01:32:27.369
I love you,
you know that.

01:32:28.750 --> 01:32:33.789
This life bit and stuck on me,
but it didn't get you.

01:32:33.824 --> 01:32:37.655
You were too quick.

01:32:42.315 --> 01:32:45.560
My boy was born with wings.

01:32:48.459 --> 01:32:51.220
You're the exact hybrid
of your mom and dad.

01:32:51.255 --> 01:32:53.706
I can see them both in your face

01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:54.430
Yup.

01:32:55.121 --> 01:32:56.985
My parents are knockouts.

01:32:59.815 --> 01:33:05.027
I can see your Mom in your face,
in a certain kind of light.

01:33:05.062 --> 01:33:07.754
My Mom and I both have
exotic birds faces.

01:33:07.789 --> 01:33:10.895
- She's more of the Cuckoo bird and I'm more of a--
- Peacock?

01:33:15.003 --> 01:33:16.521
Stay here.

01:33:17.212 --> 01:33:19.524
Right here, with me.

01:33:19.559 --> 01:33:22.182
Forever should be
much longer, Morgan.

01:33:22.217 --> 01:33:24.081
Today is all that counts.

01:33:24.115 --> 01:33:26.048
Tomorrow doesn't matter.

01:33:26.083 --> 01:33:29.431
No one wakes up and says
"hey, it's tomorrow".

01:33:29.465 --> 01:33:31.053
In fact...

01:33:35.023 --> 01:33:36.749

Morgan!

01:36:09.591 --> 01:36:13.181
If I untie you,
will you help her?

01:36:13.215 --> 01:36:14.182
Will you help her?!

01:36:14.216 --> 01:36:16.529
- This girl needs a hospital.
- No hospitals!

01:36:16.563 --> 01:36:17.633
She's going to die.

01:36:17.668 --> 01:36:20.326
I know. Why do you think
we kidnapped you?

01:36:21.672 --> 01:36:22.742
We need to do it now.

01:36:22.777 --> 01:36:24.226
Do what, exactly?

01:36:24.261 --> 01:36:25.849
I want you to open us up,

01:36:25.883 --> 01:36:28.092
put her heart in my chest
and mine in hers.

01:36:29.507 --> 01:36:33.063
Are you insane?
That would kill you both!

01:36:33.097 --> 01:36:35.065
Do it or I kill you!

01:36:35.824 --> 01:36:37.239
It's all we want.

01:36:44.868 --> 01:36:47.422
Yes, is this the front desk?
I need an ambulance.

01:36:47.456 --> 01:36:49.700
No! No!

01:36:55.188 --> 01:36:57.501
Just call an ambulance,
I got two people here with injuries,

01:36:57.535 --> 01:37:02.920
One's a possible stroke,
the other has a puncture wound to the abdomen. Hurry!

01:37:02.955 --> 01:37:07.028
This is a letter opener!
You knew I couldn't open you up.

01:37:09.789 --> 01:37:11.756
It's all we want.

01:37:13.379 --> 01:37:15.795
Stop talking.

01:37:48.932 --> 01:37:50.899
When we were littler

01:37:51.935 --> 01:37:54.213
She used to dress me up
in her clothes.

01:38:00.046 --> 01:38:01.876
Bailey?

01:38:02.255 --> 01:38:03.739
Yeah?

01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:09.573
Word is you got straight shanked
by a doctor, bro.

01:38:09.607 --> 01:38:11.299
I did?

01:38:11.333 --> 01:38:13.163
Yeah, yeah.

01:38:19.341 --> 01:38:21.792
Where's Morgan?

01:38:21.826 --> 01:38:27.660
Um, she's here.
But, um she can't uh...

01:38:27.694 --> 01:38:29.110
What do you mean?

01:38:29.662 --> 01:38:30.905
Morgan...

01:38:31.802 --> 01:38:34.046
She can't even talk anymore,
man.

01:38:34.978 --> 01:38:36.634
She can hardly move.

01:38:36.669 --> 01:38:39.327
She doesn't even remember
who I am.

01:38:39.361 --> 01:38:42.261
Morgan!

01:38:42.295 --> 01:38:43.227
Aah!

01:38:43.262 --> 01:38:46.817
Morgan, Morgan?

01:38:46.851 --> 01:38:49.337
Excuse me, sir, are you okay?

01:38:49.371 --> 01:38:51.028
Morgan? Morgan!

01:38:51.063 --> 01:38:54.894
Sir! Security.
Call security!

01:38:54.929 --> 01:38:56.240
Jordan, Jordan!
It's okay!

01:38:56.275 --> 01:38:58.415
I'm getting you out of
here, Morgan. I'm sorry.

01:38:58.449 --> 01:39:00.693
I'm her wife! I'm her wife!

01:39:00.727 --> 01:39:03.040
It's okay, I'm gonna
get you out of here.

01:39:03.075 --> 01:39:05.801
Get off of me!
Morgan, it's gonna be okay.

01:39:05.836 --> 01:39:09.081
- Jordan, it's okay. Stop.
- Fuck! Morgan!

01:39:40.664 --> 01:39:43.184
How was she?

01:39:44.150 --> 01:39:45.841
Before?

01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:48.948
Was she?

01:39:52.055 --> 01:39:53.263
Scared?

01:39:54.643 --> 01:39:56.335
She was happy.

01:39:57.681 --> 01:39:59.372
She recorded most of it
for you.

01:39:59.407 --> 01:40:01.271
She was happy.

01:40:03.652 --> 01:40:05.275
I, I need to get her
out of here.

01:40:05.309 --> 01:40:06.966
No, she can't move.

01:40:07.001 --> 01:40:09.141
Her brain is shutting down.

01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:12.075
Morgan's going to heaven,
Jordan.

01:40:12.109 --> 01:40:15.078
She can't die in here.
I promised her.

01:40:15.112 --> 01:40:19.841
- There's nothing more we can do.
-: Yes, there is.

01:40:19.875 --> 01:40:22.016
You know what she'd want.

01:40:23.845 --> 01:40:26.572
We have to do this for her.

01:40:26.606 --> 01:40:27.918
Please.

01:40:29.092 --> 01:40:32.371
She needs to be outside
so she can fly.

01:41:13.757 --> 01:41:15.034
When I quit school,

01:41:15.069 --> 01:41:17.001
I figured I'd just fall back
into using again,

01:41:17.036 --> 01:41:19.487
but something inside
me told me to stay clean.

01:41:21.454 --> 01:41:26.321
I felt like something important was coming
and I wanted to be awake to see it.

01:41:26.356 --> 01:41:28.082
Then I saw you.

01:41:29.497 --> 01:41:31.844
Jordan.

01:41:31.878 --> 01:41:35.054
It's irreversible.

01:41:36.020 --> 01:41:37.436
So is this.

01:42:00.183 --> 01:42:02.046
Tell me what to do!

01:42:03.772 --> 01:42:05.809
Please tell me what to do.

01:42:05.843 --> 01:42:07.707
What do you want to do next?

01:42:08.708 --> 01:42:10.710
You want to rob a bank?

01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:14.473
Go out in a hail of bullets?

01:42:29.039 --> 01:42:31.110
You need to know how it ends,
don't you?

01:42:42.363 --> 01:42:45.089
So, the dragonfly boy and
his princess bee

01:42:45.124 --> 01:42:49.163
flew as fast as they could
away from the kingdom.

01:42:49.197 --> 01:42:53.443
"Where are we going?"
Asked the Princess bee.

01:42:53.477 --> 01:42:57.067
"Wherever we want"
said the dragonfly boy.

01:42:57.101 --> 01:43:00.553
So they went anywhere
and everywhere together.

01:43:00.588 --> 01:43:04.902
Through lush fields, deep
valleys, thick jungle,

01:43:04.937 --> 01:43:08.078
deserts, waterfalls

01:43:08.112 --> 01:43:10.287
and even cities,

01:43:11.046 --> 01:43:12.634
they went everywhere together.

01:43:12.669 --> 01:43:15.741
But soon enough,
word spread

01:43:15.775 --> 01:43:18.019
that the queen
and her army of bees

01:43:18.053 --> 01:43:21.609
were searching for them
all over the world

01:43:21.643 --> 01:43:25.854
and if caught, they would
surely be killed.

01:43:25.889 --> 01:43:32.896
"Where can we hide?
We've been everywhere together" said the dragonfly boy sadly.

01:43:32.930 --> 01:43:39.385
The princess bee replied "I have an idea.
We can get married."

01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:43.734
It was your idea, remember?

01:43:43.769 --> 01:43:49.050
So they got married,
in the backyard of a beautiful home.

01:43:50.776 --> 01:43:56.160
"Now, the queen will never
find us!" Said the princess bee.

01:43:56.195 --> 01:44:01.269
"Even though we are married,
the Queen and her army will search for us all over the world

01:44:01.304 --> 01:44:05.825
and one day she will find us"
said the dragonfly boy.

01:44:08.207 --> 01:44:10.589
The princess bee smiled

01:44:10.623 --> 01:44:14.351
and happily said
"But now we're married,

01:44:14.386 --> 01:44:17.699
and after the wedding
comes a "honey moon".

01:44:17.734 --> 01:44:20.392
She can search everywhere
on earth for us,

01:44:20.426 --> 01:44:22.497
but she'll never find us.

01:44:22.532 --> 01:44:28.054
So the dragonfly boy and her princess bee began to fly high into the sky

01:44:28.089 --> 01:44:30.022
toward the honey moon.

01:44:30.056 --> 01:44:32.127
They flew so far up

01:44:32.162 --> 01:44:33.784
that they left this world

01:44:33.819 --> 01:44:36.166
and could be seen no more.

01:44:40.998 --> 01:44:42.793
Morgan?

01:45:27.182 --> 01:45:29.012
Fly, Morgan.
