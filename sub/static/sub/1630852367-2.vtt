WEBVTT

00:11.261 --> 00:13.472
-Get goin', go on -Get goin', go on

00:13.555 --> 00:15.891
-Take friends along -Take friends along

00:15.974 --> 00:18.143
-Go do it all -Go do it all

00:18.227 --> 00:20.103
We all just gotta unplug

00:20.187 --> 00:22.564
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

00:22.648 --> 00:24.942
Just like the way Doug unplugs

00:26.276 --> 00:30.197
Let's go, rebots. It's a busy, busy, busy day.

00:31.907 --> 00:35.369
We have to take all this old stuff, like that tire,

00:35.953 --> 00:38.205
and turn it into useful new stuff.

00:38.789 --> 00:41.208
Like a... tire swing.

00:41.291 --> 00:44.962
There's a lot to reboot, so come on. Let's roll.

00:46.839 --> 00:50.092
Wow. It sure is busy today. Hi, Dad.

00:50.509 --> 00:53.011
Next, we gotta find a new use for a worn-out couch.

00:53.095 --> 00:54.847
-Dad? -A stack of used pizza boxes--

00:54.930 --> 00:57.349
-Dad? -A crate of old toasters, a box of--

00:57.432 --> 00:58.433
Dad!

00:59.810 --> 01:01.645
Sorry, Doug. I didn't see you there.

01:02.354 --> 01:05.524
It's just we're all grinding our gears as fast as we can.

01:05.607 --> 01:07.568
This is the busiest day we've ever had!

01:07.651 --> 01:11.321
And a new shipment came in, so it just got a ton busier.

01:11.405 --> 01:14.116
Great gears! That's a lot of old bottles.

01:14.199 --> 01:17.202
Well, I'm sure we can turn 'em into something new.

01:17.286 --> 01:18.871
Let's give 'em a reboot.

01:20.539 --> 01:21.582
Whoopsie-daisy.

01:24.918 --> 01:27.421
Hey, how come there's sand in this bottle?

01:28.130 --> 01:31.175
-I can answer that! -You can, Jenny?

01:31.258 --> 01:34.970
Of course. Jenny Droneberg's the name and answering questions is...

01:35.053 --> 01:36.054
the thing I do.

01:36.471 --> 01:42.102
And there's sand in the bottles, Doug, because I collected them at the beach.

01:43.312 --> 01:44.438
Wait, beach?

01:44.521 --> 01:46.857
I don't know that word. What is it, Jenny?

01:46.940 --> 01:49.735
A beach is a colorful place.

01:49.818 --> 01:53.697
It's yellow on one side and blue on the other and--

01:53.780 --> 01:58.702
-And? -And that is what a beach is.

01:58.785 --> 02:01.288
No need to thank me. I gotta jet anyways.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.790
But what's the yellow part? And the blue?

02:04.166 --> 02:05.876
It doesn't compute.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.878
Better plug in to find out.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.384
Hey, hey, it's beach day

02:14.468 --> 02:17.304
Slip on a swimsuit, a hat And sunscreen on your back

02:17.387 --> 02:20.766
We'll see the ocean meet the land Eat sandwiches with extra sand

02:20.849 --> 02:22.267
-Let's go -Hey!

02:22.351 --> 02:23.769
Watch the crashing waves

02:23.852 --> 02:26.563
Surfers riding surfboards Somersault sideways

02:27.773 --> 02:32.903
'Cause it's a beach day, ay, ay

02:32.986 --> 02:38.784
Today is gonna be a beach day, ay, ay

02:38.867 --> 02:42.079
Today is gonna be a beach day

02:43.497 --> 02:44.873
I see.

02:45.832 --> 02:49.294
A beach is a sandy area next to a large body of water.

02:49.378 --> 02:51.630
It makes perfect sense now.

02:51.713 --> 02:53.757
But I have a big question.

02:54.091 --> 02:57.261
Why do people go there? What do you do at a beach?

02:57.344 --> 02:59.596
Uncle Forkrick, do you know why people go--

02:59.680 --> 03:01.557
Sorry, nephew bot. Can't stop now.

03:01.890 --> 03:04.768
-Mom, why do people go-- -We'll talk about it later, Doug.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.937
-Hey, Dad, do you know-- -One reboot down,

03:07.020 --> 03:09.356
way, way, way, way too many to go!

03:10.148 --> 03:14.778
Wait a nanosecond. I'll unplug and ask Emma.

03:16.029 --> 03:20.659
So, let me get this straight. You wanna know why people go to beaches?

03:20.742 --> 03:22.619
Yeah. I've never been to one.

03:22.703 --> 03:25.581
You've never been to the beach?

03:25.664 --> 03:29.168
Wow. Oh, boy. Gosh. Oh, dear. Wow.

03:29.251 --> 03:31.295
Doug, beaches are the best!

03:31.378 --> 03:33.547
But why, Emma? Why?

03:33.630 --> 03:36.758
Because there's so many fun things you can do there.

03:36.842 --> 03:38.552
Collect seashells, fly kites,

03:38.635 --> 03:43.807
build sandcastles, surf, play volleyball, snorkel, scuba dive, paddleboard.

03:44.808 --> 03:50.147
Hang on. That gave me a genius idea. We should go to the beach right now!

03:50.230 --> 03:51.481
Really?

04:03.118 --> 04:05.579
Doug, I have filled this bag

04:05.662 --> 04:09.499
with gear for all sorts of awesome beach activities.

04:09.583 --> 04:15.130
And today, you and I, my shiny friend, are gonna do each and every one of them.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.175
That seems like a lot of stuff.

04:18.257 --> 04:23.931
Exactly. It's the perfect way to show you why people love going to the beach.

04:26.225 --> 04:27.309
Come on.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.186
I'll help.

04:37.027 --> 04:40.531
And the best part is, it'll return to its old size when you open it.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.952
You know, it's good to be best buds with a bot.

04:45.244 --> 04:48.413
Oops. There's one thing I forgot to pack.

04:49.248 --> 04:53.085
My dad. We'll need him to take us to the beach.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.257
It's so beautiful.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.682
And the sand is so warm and the--

05:08.183 --> 05:11.270
Emma, help! This feathered drone is after me!

05:11.645 --> 05:14.857
Doug, that's not a drone. It's a seagull.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.149
They live at the beach.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.151
But then why is he following me?

05:18.235 --> 05:22.197
He's probably hungry. Seagulls love to eat scraps of food.

05:22.614 --> 05:25.951
Hey! That's what we could do first. We'll have a snack.

05:28.537 --> 05:30.747
'Cause everything tastes better at the beach.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.753
My sensors indicate that was delicious.

05:37.087 --> 05:40.340
The salt air adds to the flavor.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.053
I think he agrees.

05:47.431 --> 05:51.935
Right. That's one awesome and tasty beach activity down.

05:53.103 --> 05:56.064
Lots and lots more awesome beach activities to go.

05:56.148 --> 05:59.109
Think we could do it all, Emma? I have to be home by sunset.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.903
We have to, Doug.

06:00.986 --> 06:06.033
I want you to do everything so you can see why people go to the beach.

06:06.116 --> 06:08.869
Here, for our next activity...

06:11.747 --> 06:14.583
I've seen one of those before. That's a broom.

06:15.125 --> 06:17.586
One sand-free beach coming up.

06:19.004 --> 06:22.257
Doug, stop sweeping the beach.

06:22.341 --> 06:24.676
That's not a broom. It's a paddle.

06:25.135 --> 06:29.264
So we can go... paddleboarding!

06:29.890 --> 06:31.600
Paddle this way, Doug.

06:34.353 --> 06:37.439
Now, come on. Put a little robo-muscle into it.

06:39.191 --> 06:40.234
Power up.

06:47.157 --> 06:51.870
Another great thing to do at the beach is bury your friends' legs in the sand.

06:51.954 --> 06:55.666
See? You're half mermaid, half bot. You're a merbot.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.919
According to my database, this is a first.

07:00.295 --> 07:03.757
Here. So you can show all the merbots back home.

07:05.092 --> 07:08.470
Wow! I'm starting to see why people go to the beach, Emma.

07:08.554 --> 07:12.182
You can have delicious snacks, paddleboard, become a merbot.

07:12.266 --> 07:14.726
Yeah, and there's tons more to do.

07:14.810 --> 07:17.646
Tons? But it's already after noon.

07:18.272 --> 07:19.731
We gotta go faster.

07:19.815 --> 07:22.317
Look out, beach! Here we come.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.267
Okay, that was a lot of activities.

07:55.350 --> 07:56.435
What's next?

07:56.518 --> 07:58.353
An all-time classic, Doug.

07:58.437 --> 08:01.899
We're gonna build... sandcastles!

08:01.982 --> 08:04.276
First step, picture a castle.

08:07.112 --> 08:11.825
-Got it. -Great. Now build that castle!

08:11.909 --> 08:14.620
But don't worry if your sandcastle isn't perfect, Doug.

08:15.162 --> 08:20.167
You're just a first-timer, and sand can be both tricky and sticky, and--

08:20.250 --> 08:21.335
Finished!

08:23.378 --> 08:24.379
Wow!

08:25.130 --> 08:27.466
So, yeah, not bad.

08:28.342 --> 08:34.264
Just imagine how big a wave would have to be to knock that sandcastle over.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.765
Big wave?

08:36.225 --> 08:37.558
Is that a big wave?

08:38.101 --> 08:41.605
Yes, Doug. That's a very, very big wave.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.607
And it's heading right for us.

08:44.358 --> 08:46.652
It's heading right for us!

08:53.825 --> 08:55.744
Robot to the rescue.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.748
Okay, enough celebrating.

08:59.831 --> 09:02.125
We still have more beach activities to--

09:02.209 --> 09:06.171
-Wait. Doug, where's our beach bag? -It's right here, Emma.

09:07.089 --> 09:10.676
Oh, no! We can't use any of that gear now.

09:11.009 --> 09:13.387
It's a seaweed-coated mess!

09:13.470 --> 09:16.557
Yeah. It looks like it needs a reboot.

09:21.353 --> 09:24.231
Doug, look. The sun's almost set.

09:24.815 --> 09:28.694
It's over. We're not gonna do it all, Doug.

09:29.152 --> 09:31.864
You'll never get to see why people love going to the--

09:32.322 --> 09:34.032
Doug, what are you staring at?

09:34.116 --> 09:36.785
Those people. They're not playing games or anything.

09:36.869 --> 09:40.122
They're just laying there. What are they doing?

09:40.497 --> 09:45.377
Oh, my gosh, of course! That's it! Why didn't I think of it before?

09:45.711 --> 09:48.422
Doug, they're relaxing.

09:48.505 --> 09:49.631
Relaxing?

09:50.048 --> 09:53.093
Trust me. Just sprawl out on the sand,

09:53.177 --> 09:57.181
listen to the waves and enjoy the breeze.

09:58.432 --> 10:01.602
Wow. I'm so calm and peaceful.

10:02.186 --> 10:03.896
This is my favorite thing yet.

10:03.979 --> 10:07.482
Yeah. I was so busy trying to do all those activities,

10:07.566 --> 10:14.281
I forgot that the beach is also just a great place to kick back and relax.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.619
Now I know why people go to the beach.

10:19.453 --> 10:21.914
Thanks for showing me how to relax, Emma.

10:21.997 --> 10:24.666
It's the perfect way to end such a busy day.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.293
Busy day?

10:26.627 --> 10:29.421
Wait. Initiate brainstorm sequence.

10:30.339 --> 10:32.007
Brainstorm sequence complete.

10:32.424 --> 10:34.176
I've got a great idea.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.388
One last reboot.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.015
Nearly done, rebots.

10:41.433 --> 10:44.645
Doug, my sweet bot, what is this?

10:44.728 --> 10:48.023
Mom, Dad, welcome to Rebots Beach.

10:48.106 --> 10:52.569
I made it because I thought after your busy day, you might need to relax.

10:52.653 --> 10:55.489
-Relax? -What is that, son?

10:55.572 --> 10:57.157
A new operating system?

10:57.241 --> 11:00.953
It's something I learned at the beach. Here, do what I do.

11:05.999 --> 11:09.962
This relaxing stuff is incredible.

11:11.463 --> 11:13.882
It's like my gears are unwinding.

11:16.385 --> 11:20.639
-Yeah. That's it. -Now this I like.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.103
He had a busy day too.

11:31.400 --> 11:35.904
All right, everybody, here at Rebots, our drones deliver rebooted items

11:35.988 --> 11:38.365
to humans all over Mega City.

11:38.448 --> 11:40.200
And as you can see on this screen,

11:40.284 --> 11:45.247
our very own Jenny Droneberg has made more of these deliveries than anyone.

11:45.330 --> 11:48.584
And now she's about to make her 1,000th delivery.

11:50.669 --> 11:54.131
Doug, thanks for inviting me over. This is big!

11:54.214 --> 11:56.884
It sure is. Jenny Droneberg here.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.469
Off to make my thousandth delivery!

11:59.553 --> 12:00.929
Way to go, Jenny.

12:03.515 --> 12:06.852
Wow. My excitement tanks are filled to capacity.

12:07.227 --> 12:10.272
That's it. I'm somersaulting.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.153
Careful, ma'am. Careful.

12:16.528 --> 12:20.949
You were somersaulting straight for this very breakable piece of equipment.

12:21.033 --> 12:23.243
You or it could've been hurt.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.622
Hooray for safety wrap.

12:27.289 --> 12:29.291
Emma, meet Safety Bot.

12:29.374 --> 12:32.920
He's in charge of keeping rebots safe and accident-free.

12:33.003 --> 12:37.591
That's right. Safety is my name, and safety is no game.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.426
Great to meet you, Safety Bot.

12:39.510 --> 12:44.139
And sorry about that. I was so excited, I had to somersault.

12:44.223 --> 12:48.685
Then I have to ask you to please somersault somewhere else.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.812
Preferably somewhere padded.

12:52.022 --> 12:53.065
Safety first.

12:54.107 --> 12:57.903
-Why, hello, Emma. -Glad you could make it for the big day.

12:57.986 --> 13:00.197
Wouldn't miss it, Mr. and Mrs. Bot.

13:00.280 --> 13:04.243
So, what are we doing to celebrate Jenny's 1,000th delivery?

13:05.077 --> 13:07.287
We have something extra special planned.

13:07.371 --> 13:12.876
When Jenny comes back from her delivery, we're all gonna line up and...

13:12.960 --> 13:13.794
And?

13:13.877 --> 13:16.713
And... shake her hand!

13:17.089 --> 13:19.842
And then we'll all go to bed nice and early.

13:20.634 --> 13:23.554
What do you think, Emma? Pretty great plan, right?

13:24.638 --> 13:25.639
Emma?

13:25.722 --> 13:28.100
Is Emma having a processing error?

13:28.976 --> 13:31.562
What? That's no way to celebrate.

13:31.645 --> 13:34.022
We gotta do something way more fun.

13:34.106 --> 13:36.775
What's more fun than going to bed nice and early?

13:36.859 --> 13:41.446
I got it. We should throw Jenny a party!

13:42.781 --> 13:43.949
What's a party, Emma?

13:44.449 --> 13:46.660
What's a party?

13:46.743 --> 13:49.037
Doug! Doug, Doug, Doug!

13:49.121 --> 13:51.957
You gotta plug in, right now, buddy.

13:54.418 --> 13:56.086
Welcome to the party

13:56.170 --> 13:59.464
We can pop a piñata Blow up a big balloon

13:59.923 --> 14:02.384
Go low with the limbo Grab a chair when they stop the tunes

14:02.467 --> 14:03.302
What?

14:03.385 --> 14:06.889
When something special happens Or someone does something great

14:06.972 --> 14:10.559
We get together at a party That is how we celebrate

14:11.059 --> 14:14.354
-It's all part of a party -Yeah!

14:14.438 --> 14:17.566
-Games, balloons and friends -It's a party, party

14:17.649 --> 14:21.570
-Sent out invitations -It's a party

14:21.653 --> 14:23.071
Hopefully there's cake

14:23.155 --> 14:25.240
It's a party, party, party, yeah

14:25.324 --> 14:27.242
That is how we celebrate

14:28.577 --> 14:32.414
Parties look amazing! They have so many fun parts.

14:32.497 --> 14:34.875
Only, I have a big question.

14:34.958 --> 14:37.461
I wonder which part Jenny would like best?

14:37.836 --> 14:40.214
There's just one way to find out, Doug.

14:40.297 --> 14:42.966
You gotta unplug, and we'll give Jenny a party.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.302
Then we can see what she likes best.

14:45.385 --> 14:48.597
But Emma, we bots aren't programmed to party.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.849
We don't even know how to put one together.

14:50.933 --> 14:52.851
Then it's a good thing for you bots

14:52.935 --> 14:57.105
that you have one of the world's finest party planners here to help.

14:57.189 --> 14:58.899
Really? Who?

14:58.982 --> 15:00.108
Me!

15:00.192 --> 15:05.822
Doug, I think it's time for you to upgrade from a boy robot to a party machine!

15:33.892 --> 15:36.228
Now that looks like a party.

15:38.564 --> 15:40.440
Wow! This is great, Emma.

15:40.524 --> 15:45.028
I just can't wait to find out which part of our party Jenny likes best.

15:45.112 --> 15:47.739
Did someone say party?

15:47.823 --> 15:50.826
Because I do not know what that is.

15:50.909 --> 15:53.537
A party, Jenny, is an event where people get together

15:53.620 --> 15:55.247
to celebrate something special.

15:55.330 --> 15:59.710
And this party is to celebrate your 1,000th delivery!

16:00.460 --> 16:05.424
A party for me? You guys, I'm so touched.

16:05.507 --> 16:08.177
I am just spinning in a circle!

16:10.137 --> 16:11.388
Getting dizzy here.

16:11.972 --> 16:13.724
Okay, we're back. Let's party!

16:15.934 --> 16:17.352
Hooray!

16:20.606 --> 16:21.982
What's this?

16:22.065 --> 16:24.651
Banners you can get wrapped up in?

16:24.735 --> 16:27.279
Baked goods you light on fire?

16:27.529 --> 16:31.241
A tasseled paper animal filled with hard candy?

16:32.242 --> 16:33.577
Oh, dear!

16:33.660 --> 16:37.789
This party thing doesn't seem very... safe!

16:38.165 --> 16:42.920
Okay, Doug, this first part of the party is called the limbo.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.922
Cool. How do we play, Emma?

16:45.005 --> 16:48.425
The rules could not be simpler, my shiny friend.

16:48.509 --> 16:52.304
All you have to do is walk under this limbo stick without touching it.

16:52.387 --> 16:53.680
What happens if you touch it?

16:55.641 --> 16:56.642
You're out.

16:56.725 --> 16:57.726
You try, Doug.

17:05.442 --> 17:10.656
Well, that settles it. My best bot can limbo.

17:11.698 --> 17:12.741
That was fun.

17:12.824 --> 17:15.993
I think this could be Jenny's favorite part of the party.

17:16.078 --> 17:19.414
Maybe, but then she might like my favorite part of the party.

17:19.498 --> 17:22.416
Come on, Jenny. Tell us about your big delivery.

17:22.501 --> 17:25.170
Well, it was a cold, brisk morning.

17:25.253 --> 17:27.964
There I was, wind in my face, clouds in my eyes.

17:28.048 --> 17:30.551
But this drone had to keep on going!

17:31.051 --> 17:35.556
Hello, limbo stick. Or should I say, "danger stick."

17:36.431 --> 17:38.100
You're a grade-A tripping hazard.

17:38.183 --> 17:39.935
Limbo, you gotta go!

17:41.687 --> 17:47.025
Doug, I present to you something no party can be called a party without,

17:47.526 --> 17:49.736
the table of snacks.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.239
It looks so good.

17:53.448 --> 17:55.659
It all is so good, Doug.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.039
It's like a party in my stomach.

18:01.123 --> 18:03.375
Jenny, you've gotta come try these.

18:03.458 --> 18:04.918
I will, Doug-o.

18:05.002 --> 18:08.046
I'll be delivering these snacks to my mouth soon,

18:08.130 --> 18:12.467
but right now I'm teaching my buds here some amazing flying moves.

18:12.551 --> 18:13.677
Wow!

18:14.511 --> 18:16.263
I guess she'll try them later, Doug.

18:16.346 --> 18:19.558
And we still have more things to do.

18:22.728 --> 18:26.064
Caution! Caution! Snacks on the floor.

18:26.356 --> 18:28.108
Someone could slip on them.

18:28.192 --> 18:31.069
These snacks are deliciously unsafe.

18:31.153 --> 18:34.990
All right, Doug. This is called musical chairs.

18:35.073 --> 18:36.575
-We're dancing -Dancing

18:36.658 --> 18:39.745
See? We dance around the chairs to the music.

18:39.828 --> 18:41.747
-Dancing round and round -Hey!

18:43.290 --> 18:45.209
Then, when the music stops...

18:45.292 --> 18:46.293
Dancing--

18:54.009 --> 18:55.802
Sorry, but you're out!

18:58.555 --> 19:00.682
And we're on to round two.

19:02.142 --> 19:03.227
Unsafe.

19:04.102 --> 19:05.604
-Round and round -Unsafe.

19:05.687 --> 19:06.772
We go round and round

19:06.855 --> 19:07.856
-Unsafe. -Hey!

19:12.152 --> 19:13.904
Are we all out?

19:13.987 --> 19:16.198
I don't understand. What happened?

19:16.281 --> 19:17.699
Where'd all the chairs go?

19:18.242 --> 19:21.411
Emma, where did everything go?

19:21.495 --> 19:25.249
Look! All our party games and snacks are missing.

19:25.874 --> 19:28.544
Doug, our party is ruined!

19:28.919 --> 19:30.629
Oh, no, poor Jenny.

19:30.712 --> 19:34.216
How will we ever find out which part she liked best?

19:36.343 --> 19:37.928
Doug, what was that?

19:38.011 --> 19:40.013
It sounded like a reboot booth.

19:45.477 --> 19:49.815
Emma, look! One of the musical chairs is inside that booth.

19:49.898 --> 19:51.400
What's it doing in there?

19:53.777 --> 19:55.863
The booth just rebooted that chair.

19:55.946 --> 19:59.199
It turned it into... a safety hat?

19:59.283 --> 20:01.743
Who would do such a thing?

20:02.786 --> 20:04.121
Safety Bot!

20:04.204 --> 20:06.081
Hello, Doug and Emma. Great news.

20:06.164 --> 20:09.668
I took all those remarkably unsafe party games and food

20:09.751 --> 20:13.338
and rebooted them into much safer items. See?

20:13.422 --> 20:14.673
No need to thank me.

20:14.756 --> 20:17.384
I'm just glad the party is safe now.

20:17.467 --> 20:20.304
Safety Bot, those items weren't unsafe.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.514
We were going to be careful with them.

20:22.598 --> 20:23.849
You were?

20:23.932 --> 20:26.685
Yeah, and we kinda needed them for Jenny's party.

20:26.768 --> 20:28.896
We can't have it without them.

20:28.979 --> 20:32.733
Now we'll never know which part of a party Jenny likes best.

20:33.650 --> 20:36.695
Oh, dear. I didn't mean to wreck the party.

20:36.778 --> 20:40.073
I thought it was better to be safe than sorry.

20:40.157 --> 20:42.659
But now I'm just sorry.

20:42.743 --> 20:44.453
I ruined everyone's good time.

20:45.996 --> 20:51.251
Actually, I think everyone's still having a good time.

20:51.793 --> 20:55.130
-Well, I like to lift boxes. -Boxes?

20:55.214 --> 20:57.007
I've never heard of one before.

20:57.508 --> 20:58.675
Doug! Emma!

20:59.384 --> 21:01.470
This party is perfect!

21:01.553 --> 21:05.682
Perfect? But Jenny, there are no snacks and games.

21:05.766 --> 21:09.353
Yeah, what about the piñata or the musical chairs?

21:09.436 --> 21:11.855
Are they gone? Didn't notice.

21:11.939 --> 21:14.316
I've just been having such a blast

21:14.399 --> 21:17.236
telling everyone the story of my thousandth delivery.

21:17.319 --> 21:23.659
And hanging out with my drone buddies and the forklifts and you two.

21:25.160 --> 21:29.540
Hanging out with all my friends has been my favorite part of this party.

21:29.623 --> 21:30.624
It has?

21:30.707 --> 21:35.170
Of course! Doug, we've been so focused on all the other stuff

21:35.254 --> 21:38.549
that we forgot friends are what really makes a party.

21:39.007 --> 21:43.095
So the best part of a party is getting to have fun with the people you love.

21:44.263 --> 21:46.890
I learned Jenny's favorite part of her party.

21:46.974 --> 21:48.642
It's being with her friends!

21:48.725 --> 21:51.812
Yep! And everyone's having so much fun.

21:54.147 --> 21:55.941
Not everyone.

21:56.567 --> 22:00.279
Poor Safety Bot. He was just doing his job.

22:00.362 --> 22:03.323
Now he's just sitting alone by that reboot booth.

22:03.907 --> 22:05.075
Wait, booth?

22:05.784 --> 22:07.828
Inputting what I learned today,

22:07.911 --> 22:12.583
we'll turn his reboot booth into a party photo booth

22:13.041 --> 22:15.627
so we can take pictures with all our friends.

22:16.128 --> 22:19.798
All right. Now let's try to move in closer, but not too close!

22:19.882 --> 22:22.384
Don't want to bump into each other.

22:22.467 --> 22:25.929
Okay, everyone say, "safety!"

22:26.013 --> 22:27.723
Safety!

22:28.432 --> 22:30.517
Look at all of us together.

22:31.476 --> 22:33.937
Now that's one party I'll never forget.

22:34.897 --> 22:36.815
It's all part of a party

22:36.899 --> 22:37.900
Yeah!

22:48.493 --> 22:49.494
Yeah!

22:49.578 --> 22:51.496
It's all part of a party

22:54.041 --> 22:56.084
It's a party, party

22:57.628 --> 22:59.838
It's a party

22:59.922 --> 23:02.216
That is how we celebrate
