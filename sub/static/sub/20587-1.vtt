03:29.543 --> 03:31.178
Hi, I'm Zoe.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.112
Hello, pleased to meet you.

03:32.145 --> 03:33.080
Nice to meet you.

03:33.113 --> 03:33.914
Mark.

03:33.947 --> 03:35.048
Come on in.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.553
So as you can see, it's pretty small.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.955
Might not be the ideal place
for starting a family,

03:41.989 --> 03:43.824
but let's take a look.

03:45.192 --> 03:47.795
Not nearly enough closet space.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.566
Only one bathroom.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.102
Plus, the back yard backs
right up to the woods,

03:55.135 --> 03:56.837
and who knows what kind of wild animals

03:56.870 --> 03:58.806
are lurking back there.

04:00.308 --> 04:01.775
But you never know.

04:01.809 --> 04:05.613
Why don't you take one of
Larry's fliers just in case?

04:08.449 --> 04:09.783
Well guys, it's been a pleasure.

04:09.817 --> 04:12.085
Thank you so much for coming.

04:12.119 --> 04:13.120
Bye.

04:13.153 --> 04:13.954
Buh-bye.

04:13.987 --> 04:14.888
Drive safe.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.990
Good luck with everything.

04:23.464 --> 04:24.298
Oh shit.

04:40.247 --> 04:41.081
Okay.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.100
Hi.

05:06.374 --> 05:08.542
You're not wearing that.

05:08.576 --> 05:11.612
It was this or an evening gown.

05:14.247 --> 05:17.184

05:17.217 --> 05:21.355

05:21.389 --> 05:23.891
So, how'd you get Larry
to give you two weeks off?

05:23.924 --> 05:24.825
I quit.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.293
Shut up, no you didn't.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.195
Look, okay, I'm not
gonna end up like my dad.

05:28.228 --> 05:29.597
There's more to life than just work,

05:29.630 --> 05:32.366
and I really need a change.

05:32.400 --> 05:35.168
So, did Larry lose it when you told him?

05:35.202 --> 05:37.805
I haven't exactly told him yet.

Yo-yo.

05:56.990 --> 05:57.891
Drake.

05:57.925 --> 05:58.792
Phil.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.227
What's happening?

06:01.294 --> 06:02.596
Not a bad day for a hike, eh?

06:02.630 --> 06:04.297
What we got to day, five hikers?

06:04.331 --> 06:05.399
Four.

06:05.433 --> 06:07.134
Mr. Bernstein got the flu.

06:07.167 --> 06:08.602
That's too bad.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.209
Hey, why are you all suited up.

06:16.243 --> 06:18.579
Sit down, we need to talk.

06:28.456 --> 06:30.758
What is it, what's going on?

06:30.791 --> 06:31.959
Look, Drake.

06:33.461 --> 06:37.465
I like you, you're a great trail master.

06:38.866 --> 06:41.735
I just can't keep you on, I'm sorry.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.372
You're joking, right?

06:45.405 --> 06:46.874
It's partly my fault, I should have done

06:46.907 --> 06:49.710
a background check before
officially bringing you on.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.580
I mean, it's usually formality.

06:52.613 --> 06:56.249
I had no idea you were
a convicted felon.

06:56.283 --> 06:59.352
Drake, I can't keep you on with this.

07:00.788 --> 07:03.591
Phil, come on, how do you know
this is even me?

07:03.624 --> 07:05.693
I'm not the only Drake Jacobs
running around.

07:05.726 --> 07:06.894
It's a mix-up.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.330
I'm sorry, Drake.

07:10.363 --> 07:11.364
Phil, hey.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.967
I get it, okay?

07:14.001 --> 07:15.002
I do.

07:15.035 --> 07:16.737
But that's not me.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.839
Look, why don't you let me take
this tour out, and when I

07:18.872 --> 07:21.308
get back, we'll sort out
this whole mess, alright?

07:21.341 --> 07:23.310
I'm sorry, can't do it.

07:23.343 --> 07:24.444
I need you to clear out your stuff.

07:24.478 --> 07:26.480
I'm gonna take this one myself.

07:26.514 --> 07:27.981
Phil, come on.

07:28.015 --> 07:31.652
Look, don't make this harder
than it has to be.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.429
I'm begging you, please, don't do this.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.263
Drake.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.032
Look, my mom,

07:45.065 --> 07:47.400
she's in hospice, she's got cancer.

07:47.434 --> 07:48.936
I'm all she's got.

07:50.504 --> 07:51.839
I need this job.

07:53.507 --> 07:55.543
I need your satellite phone
and the first aid kit

07:55.576 --> 07:58.245
from your bag before you go.

08:02.550 --> 08:04.652
You know what?

08:04.685 --> 08:06.319
Fuck you.

08:06.353 --> 08:07.521
Fuck you.

08:07.555 --> 08:08.756
Leave the premises,

08:08.789 --> 08:09.590
- or I'm calling the cops.
- Put the phone down.

08:09.623 --> 08:10.791
Jesus.

08:12.059 --> 08:13.260
Get off of me.

08:13.293 --> 08:15.228
Alright, okay, okay, look, stop.

08:15.262 --> 08:16.396
Get out.

08:16.429 --> 08:17.364
Calm down!

08:17.397 --> 08:18.098
- Get out.
- Jesus.

08:18.131 --> 08:19.767
Get off of me.

08:30.243 --> 08:31.078
Shit.

08:35.649 --> 08:36.482
Fuck me.

08:41.121 --> 08:44.391
Well, I got you a little present.

08:44.424 --> 08:46.660
It's nothing big, it's in my purse.

08:46.694 --> 08:49.262
Oh my God, I can't believe
you got me a gift.

08:49.296 --> 08:50.097
You'll love it.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.364
Really?

08:51.398 --> 08:54.367
Oh God, what do you have in this thing?

08:58.438 --> 09:00.107
Pepper spray.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.942
Well, you don't know
any of these people.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.244
I mean, what if you're the only girl.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.213
I probably will be the only girl.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.681
I mean, how many women
do you know that wanna go

09:07.715 --> 09:11.318
on a 10 day hike of
the Appalachian Trail?

09:11.351 --> 09:12.285
None.

09:47.187 --> 09:48.088
Hi, I'm Dan.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.423
I'm here for the 10 day hike.

09:50.457 --> 09:52.192
Hike's been cancelled.

09:52.225 --> 09:53.393
Cancelled?

09:53.426 --> 09:54.327
I'm sorry, you can call the office.

09:54.361 --> 09:55.528
They can refund your money

09:55.562 --> 09:56.196
or they can reschedule for a later time.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.164
Wait a minute.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.398
I just flew across the country

09:58.431 --> 10:00.668
from San Francisco for this thing.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.469
I'm not just flying home.

10:02.502 --> 10:03.671
I'm sorry.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.372
It's been cancelled.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.276
Well...

10:09.309 --> 10:10.410
Phil confirmed everything last week,

10:10.443 --> 10:12.545
I'm sure he'll clear this up.

10:12.579 --> 10:13.413
Woah.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.217
You said 10-day hike.

10:18.318 --> 10:19.152
Yeah.

10:20.520 --> 10:24.091
Yeah, we're good, that's still on.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.192
- So, we're good.
- We're good.

10:25.225 --> 10:26.660
Hey.

10:26.694 --> 10:29.229
I'm Brian, this is my brother, Sam.

10:29.262 --> 10:30.964
We're here for the hike.

10:30.998 --> 10:32.432
Call me Cheese.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.300
Dan.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.336
And I'm Drake.

10:36.369 --> 10:38.605
I'm your trail master.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.974
I'll be leading the tour and

10:42.175 --> 10:44.812
keeping you guys out of harms way.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.923
Hold up, guys, hold up.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.590
Hold it right there.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.161
Man, I hope you guys all bought
your boots and rain gear.

11:01.194 --> 11:04.131
You're not borrowing mine.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.332
Alright.

11:05.365 --> 11:07.134
We're gonna be shooting
for 10 miles a day.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.202
We'll see how you guys do with that.

11:09.236 --> 11:11.071
I don't want anybody
falling behind, okay?

11:11.104 --> 11:13.073
You do, you'll throw off our pace.

11:13.106 --> 11:15.475
And remember, the trail's
a dangerous place,

11:15.508 --> 11:17.878
so I need you to keep your eyes peeled.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.780
We're gonna be days
away from civilization,

11:19.813 --> 11:22.615
so I need you to follow my lead,

11:22.649 --> 11:24.952
keep up, and don't do anything stupid.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.453
What?

11:26.486 --> 11:29.757
The brochure mentioned
we'd have first aid kits.

11:29.790 --> 11:30.991
You can hang with that,

11:31.024 --> 11:31.992
we'll all have a pretty
good time, alright?

11:35.695 --> 11:36.529
Hey.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.300
She with us?

11:40.333 --> 11:42.235
It's a chick.

11:42.269 --> 11:43.103
Hi.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.539
I'm Zoe, is this the trail tour?

11:46.573 --> 11:47.507
- Yeah.
- Yeah

11:47.540 --> 11:48.408
Okay.

11:48.441 --> 11:49.476
You're late.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.611
Yeah, sorry, we got lost.

11:51.644 --> 11:52.479
Here.

12:00.520 --> 12:01.354
Barbie.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.757
Your pack.

12:03.791 --> 12:04.892
Oh, thanks.

12:05.725 --> 12:06.760
Let's get moving.

12:06.794 --> 12:07.828
We got a long hike to go to get

12:07.861 --> 12:10.363
to the campsite before sunset.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.513
Jesus, you bring enough stuff?

12:26.546 --> 12:28.315
Maybe you should have brought a TV.

12:28.348 --> 12:29.883
I brought a laptop.

12:29.917 --> 12:30.750
I'm sure you did.

12:30.784 --> 12:31.618
Hold on.

12:36.323 --> 12:39.226
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

12:42.095 --> 12:45.465
Dude, that stuff's expensive.

12:45.498 --> 12:47.200
You'll thank me in 20 minutes

12:47.234 --> 12:48.201
when we're up on the mountain.

12:48.235 --> 12:49.202
What will I sit on?

12:49.236 --> 12:50.470
You really wanna be carrying

12:50.503 --> 12:52.272
this shit around for the next 90 miles?

12:53.573 --> 12:54.374
That's why I bought it.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.076
Let's go, come on.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.046
I gotta admit, that is better.

13:21.034 --> 13:21.935
You okay?

13:23.336 --> 13:24.171
Yeah.

13:25.072 --> 13:26.506
This is what happens

13:26.539 --> 13:27.740
when you spend the last 20 years

13:27.774 --> 13:29.442
sitting on your ass in
front of a computer.

13:30.743 --> 13:33.046
Well, at least you're
taking a break from it.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.282
All work and no play, right?

13:35.315 --> 13:36.483
Yeah.

13:36.516 --> 13:39.252
I thought it's what my wife wanted.

13:39.286 --> 13:42.289
Lots of money, nice house, two BMWs.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.426
Then she left me for
the yoga instructor.

13:46.459 --> 13:47.260
Ooo.

13:47.294 --> 13:48.929
Namaste.

13:48.962 --> 13:52.065
I was doing it all for her,
and she didn't give a shit.

13:52.099 --> 13:55.869
Come on guys, keep moving.

13:55.903 --> 13:56.904
Good times.

14:10.583 --> 14:13.020
I really thought you were
gonna change your mind.

14:13.053 --> 14:13.887
Why?

14:15.288 --> 14:18.558
I dunno, last time we met,
you just seemed upset.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.493
It was Dad's funeral.

14:23.796 --> 14:25.698
So, how was graduation?

14:27.500 --> 14:28.801
Well, I passed.

14:28.835 --> 14:30.103
I made it.

14:30.137 --> 14:31.871
That's good.

14:31.905 --> 14:34.607
Man, I couldn't wait to
get out of high school.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.476
College is so much better.

14:36.509 --> 14:37.344
Trust me.

14:38.745 --> 14:40.580
I don't really think I'm gonna
do the whole college thing.

14:40.613 --> 14:41.748
I don't really have the grades,

14:41.781 --> 14:42.950
and Mom really doesn't have the money,

14:42.983 --> 14:46.419
so I figured I'd go
get a job or something.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.223
Hey, there's nothing wrong with that.

14:50.257 --> 14:53.093
My degree hasn't done shit for me.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.268
What the hell is that?

15:03.436 --> 15:04.371
Oh man.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.305
What is that?

15:05.338 --> 15:07.907
I dunno, it doesn't look good.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.043
Cheese, hold, what are you doing?

15:10.077 --> 15:10.978
Cheese.

15:11.011 --> 15:11.844
Hey.

15:11.878 --> 15:12.679
Sam.

15:12.712 --> 15:13.780
Wait.

15:20.887 --> 15:22.655
This is a bad idea.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.792
Excuse me, excuse me.

15:25.825 --> 15:26.826
Oh my God.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.304
Jesus, what the hell happened?

15:37.337 --> 15:39.939
Looks like a bear attack.

15:39.973 --> 15:43.476
Don't worry, the rangers
are on their way.

15:44.844 --> 15:46.379
Drake.

15:46.413 --> 15:47.247
Drake.

15:54.221 --> 15:57.157
Come on, we gotta keep moving.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.525
Keep moving?

15:58.558 --> 15:59.959
What about her,
shouldn't we do something?

15:59.993 --> 16:03.163
Look, it's a horrible thing,
but help's on the way.

16:03.196 --> 16:04.998
We keep moving.

16:05.032 --> 16:06.399
I'm with Drake.

16:06.433 --> 16:09.002
Let's get the hell out of here.

16:17.744 --> 16:18.945
Hey.

16:18.978 --> 16:19.779
Hey.

16:19.812 --> 16:20.713
What?

16:20.747 --> 16:23.216
Isn't that the main trail?

16:23.250 --> 16:25.352
You paid for a guide, right?

16:25.385 --> 16:26.986
Guys, you don't need me
for the main trail.

16:27.020 --> 16:29.989
You can just follow the mob of tourists.

16:30.023 --> 16:31.624
We're going off-trail.

16:31.658 --> 16:32.825
Come on.

16:32.859 --> 16:34.061
What about the bear?

16:34.094 --> 16:35.295
Bear won't mess with the five of us,

16:35.328 --> 16:38.031
there's safety in numbers.

16:41.868 --> 16:43.570
Hey, be careful, watch your step.

16:43.603 --> 16:45.305
Wet shoes will ruin your day.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.840
Just go slow, it'll be fine.

16:48.775 --> 16:49.609
Sorry.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.284
Shit, damn, fire.

17:02.922 --> 17:04.824
Gonna be a long 10 days.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.093
Up this way, guys.

17:06.126 --> 17:06.959
Keep up.

17:15.902 --> 17:17.069
Hey guys, you go ahead.

17:17.104 --> 17:18.271
I'll catch up.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.208
Go ahead.

17:52.071 --> 17:52.905
Hello?

18:01.614 --> 18:02.449
Guys.

18:15.362 --> 18:16.796
Hello?

18:19.432 --> 18:20.267
Guys?

18:31.811 --> 18:32.979
Guys, hold up.

18:34.147 --> 18:36.249
You guys are gonna see things

18:36.283 --> 18:39.452
those tourists on the
main trail never see.

18:39.486 --> 18:41.388
Just gorgeous.

18:41.421 --> 18:42.589
You okay, Dan?

18:43.756 --> 18:44.924
Yeah.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.125
I'm fine, no problem.

18:46.159 --> 18:47.860
Alright, let's relax for a second.

18:49.095 --> 18:50.297
It's the first time I can remember

18:50.330 --> 18:53.065
not having internet or
a cellphone that works.

18:53.099 --> 18:54.601
Technology's a crutch, kid.

18:54.634 --> 18:57.036
Government wants you hooked
on it so they can watch you.

18:57.069 --> 18:58.070
Control you.

18:58.104 --> 18:59.105
It's a scam.

19:00.507 --> 19:03.109
I wouldn't call it a crutch.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.944
I'd call it pretty good living.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.112
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.214
Seen the news lately?

19:07.247 --> 19:08.047
No.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.282
It's everywhere, man.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.418
Surveillance drones,
NSA information gathering.

19:11.451 --> 19:12.985
Spy satellites.

19:13.019 --> 19:15.722
They're taking away our rights
and our privacy bit by bit,

19:15.755 --> 19:17.757
and no one really cares.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.960
That's scary shit, man.

19:45.151 --> 19:47.820
This was once all Cherokee land.

19:49.088 --> 19:52.091
It was considered sacred ground,

19:52.124 --> 19:55.295
and trespassers would
be killed on sight.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.797
The Nunahee, or the Immortals,

19:57.830 --> 19:59.932
were said to inhabit these mountains.

19:59.966 --> 20:02.068
They were the protectors.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.004
Spirit guides.

20:05.037 --> 20:08.040
And they would help the Cherokee.

20:08.074 --> 20:10.009
Legend has it when the
Cherokee were driven

20:10.042 --> 20:14.213
from these lands, the
Nunahee left, leaving a void.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.850
So, what happened?

20:17.884 --> 20:19.319
Without the protectors,

20:19.352 --> 20:23.323
the Shadow People came
to haunt these mountains.

20:23.356 --> 20:26.025
Consider it the white man's curse.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.495
He's just trying to scare you.

20:28.528 --> 20:29.429
Trail talk.

20:30.430 --> 20:31.598
Ghost stories.

20:33.266 --> 20:36.469
I dunno, I find it fascinating.

20:36.503 --> 20:37.437
I'm just trying to tell you guys

20:37.470 --> 20:39.739
about the legend, that's all.

20:40.940 --> 20:44.043
I think it's sad what we did to them.

20:45.445 --> 20:46.546
The Cherokee.

20:48.615 --> 20:49.782
It was actually disease

20:49.816 --> 20:51.684
that killed more Indians than anything.

20:51.718 --> 20:52.652
Stuff the Europeans brought over

20:52.685 --> 20:54.954
that they weren't immune to.

20:56.523 --> 20:57.524
It's true.

21:02.462 --> 21:03.963
I'm turning in, you guys.

21:03.996 --> 21:08.167
We got a busy day tomorrow,
I suggest you do the same.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.903
Good night, Drake.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.142
What are you doing?

21:50.176 --> 21:52.745
Nothing, taking a piss.

21:52.779 --> 21:53.646
Is that weed?

21:53.680 --> 21:55.415
No, no, no, no way.

21:56.383 --> 21:58.250
I can smell it.

21:58.284 --> 22:01.721
I don't care, I'm cool,
let me have some.

22:01.754 --> 22:03.122
Seriously?

22:03.155 --> 22:04.591
Yeah, of course.

22:04.624 --> 22:06.292
Used to smoke all the time in college.

22:06.325 --> 22:09.295
You know, I used to play
guitar in a metal band.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.100
Of course, that was a long time ago.

22:14.133 --> 22:15.402
Come on.

22:16.903 --> 22:17.704
Come on.

22:17.737 --> 22:18.838
Okay, fine.

22:24.010 --> 22:24.811
Sh.

22:24.844 --> 22:25.612
Sh.

22:25.645 --> 22:27.113
Sh.

22:27.146 --> 22:28.381
That's harsh.

22:28.415 --> 22:30.917
Yeah, it's good weed, be careful.

22:32.719 --> 22:34.186
Thanks, I'm good.

22:35.655 --> 22:37.056
What was that?

22:37.089 --> 22:38.024
Did you hear that?

22:38.057 --> 22:40.259
I dunno, maybe.

22:40.292 --> 22:41.494
- Boo!
- Oh my God.

22:42.929 --> 22:44.196
Damn it, Drake.

22:45.331 --> 22:46.933
I almost shit myself.

22:46.966 --> 22:49.869
What are you guys doing out here?

22:51.604 --> 22:52.439
Nothin'.

22:53.640 --> 22:54.807
Takin' a piss.

22:55.775 --> 22:56.643
Together.

22:59.979 --> 23:00.813
Come on.

23:01.914 --> 23:03.583
You shouldn't leave the campsite.

23:03.616 --> 23:06.553
It's dangerous out here after dark.

23:47.059 --> 23:48.695
Ah, get out of here, out!

23:52.799 --> 23:54.400
What was that?

23:54.433 --> 23:55.434
A bear.

23:55.468 --> 23:57.103
He got into the food.

23:57.136 --> 23:59.305
Is it gone, are we safe?

23:59.338 --> 24:03.042
Yeah, he ran off,
he was just after the food.

24:03.075 --> 24:05.011
Who left the food out?

24:05.044 --> 24:06.679
I told you, you have to put everything

24:06.713 --> 24:09.015
up in the tree at night.

24:09.048 --> 24:11.283
Drake, I'm so sorry.

24:11.317 --> 24:13.986
I forgot, I didn't mean to.

24:15.454 --> 24:19.892
Clean this stuff up
before the bear comes back.

24:28.234 --> 24:31.003
Hey, Drake, I'm sorry about last night.

24:31.037 --> 24:34.240
I got hungry, and I forgot
to put my snack pack away.

24:34.273 --> 24:35.441
It was stupid.

24:37.510 --> 24:38.878
Munchies.

24:38.911 --> 24:42.248
Look, you gotta stay focused, alright?

24:43.082 --> 24:44.450
This is no joke.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.485
Nature is not forgiving.

24:51.290 --> 24:56.228
I'm gonna make a mountain man
out of you yet, Dan I promise.

24:56.262 --> 24:59.566
Hey, so I was thinking,
we should all have trail names.

24:59.599 --> 25:01.333
Reading this book, Just Passing Through,

25:01.367 --> 25:03.870
they all have trail names.

25:03.903 --> 25:04.704
'Kay.

25:04.737 --> 25:06.238
Yours is Snickers.

25:07.373 --> 25:09.208
That's awesome.

25:09.241 --> 25:12.411
No, not like that, like Wandering Wolf

25:12.444 --> 25:15.181
or Soaring Eagle, something cool.

25:16.048 --> 25:19.051
How 'bout Wolf Down Snickers?

25:19.085 --> 25:21.153
Whatever, Cheese, what's up with that?

25:21.187 --> 25:24.256
My dad named me that as a kid
'cause all I ate was cheese.

25:24.290 --> 25:26.358
This one time, I ate this whole block

25:26.392 --> 25:29.629
of Velveeta cheese, and I was
stopped up for a week.

25:29.662 --> 25:31.664
Been there, done that.

25:32.965 --> 25:33.800
Way bad.

25:52.985 --> 25:55.521
Yeah it was pretty strange
meeting Sam for the first time.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.857
It was at Dad's funeral.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.992
And neither of us had
any idea that he had

26:00.026 --> 26:02.595
this whole other life going on.

26:04.230 --> 26:06.999
I was an only child before that.

26:07.033 --> 26:08.267
That's crazy.

26:10.402 --> 26:11.638
You mad at him?

26:12.639 --> 26:13.472
Your dad?

26:15.207 --> 26:16.609
No, not really.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.145
He's gone.

26:19.178 --> 26:22.615
I've got a brother now, kind of cool.

26:22.649 --> 26:24.383
I dunno, I thought it would be good

26:24.416 --> 26:27.419
to do something, just the two of us.

26:29.789 --> 26:33.392
It's good you're taking
the time to do this.

26:33.425 --> 26:34.260
My dad was

26:36.195 --> 26:37.463
always working.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.769
And then, he had a heart attack.

26:44.036 --> 26:47.206
I wanted to do this for him, you know?

26:48.507 --> 26:49.408
And for me.

26:50.877 --> 26:54.446
I just kept thinking,
"I don't wanna end up like that...

26:54.480 --> 26:58.050
I don't wanna regret not doing things."

26:58.084 --> 27:00.119
Yeah, I know what you mean.

27:00.152 --> 27:01.320
Although it did take me two years

27:01.353 --> 27:04.156
to work up the nerve to do it alone.

27:05.424 --> 27:08.327
I wouldn't say that you're alone.

27:30.582 --> 27:32.318
Hey, is this right?

27:33.452 --> 27:34.286
Drake?

27:35.855 --> 27:36.655
Drake?

27:36.689 --> 27:37.523
What?

27:39.158 --> 27:40.592
Are we lost?

27:40.626 --> 27:42.161
No, we're not lost.

27:42.194 --> 27:44.130
Well, where is the trail?

27:44.163 --> 27:45.464
Yeah, where are going?

27:45.497 --> 27:47.466
Hey, I got a GPS.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.601
It's about a half-mile ahead, alright?

27:49.635 --> 27:50.469
Relax.

27:51.637 --> 27:54.206
Look, I'm sorry but
this doesn't seem right.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.208
How would you know?

27:56.242 --> 27:57.710
Have you been here before?

28:01.580 --> 28:03.682
Maybe you'd like to lead.

28:05.117 --> 28:06.719
Drake, come on.

28:06.753 --> 28:07.920
Let's just go.

28:23.469 --> 28:24.703
Legend has it the Cherokee

28:24.737 --> 28:27.639
called this place Strawberry Fields.

28:27.673 --> 28:30.442
'Cause in the springtime,
before the grass grew tall,

28:30.476 --> 28:33.780
the place was filled
it wild strawberries.

28:33.813 --> 28:36.682
Are there snakes in here?

28:36.715 --> 28:38.818
Yeah, absolutely.

28:38.851 --> 28:39.752
Really?

28:39.786 --> 28:41.020
Just watch where you step.

28:41.053 --> 28:43.455
You don't bother them,
they don't bother you.

28:43.489 --> 28:44.323
Come on.

29:15.421 --> 29:17.756
Hey, Drake, take a look at this.

29:17.790 --> 29:19.291
It's an Indian grave marker.

29:19.325 --> 29:20.559
Leave it alone.

29:25.197 --> 29:26.866
What did I just say?

29:28.634 --> 29:30.236
What are you doing?

29:31.403 --> 29:32.538
You know, being a trail master...

29:32.571 --> 29:34.306
I'm surprised you don't
know that garnets,

29:34.340 --> 29:38.510
rubies, even emeralds have
been found in these parts.

29:40.446 --> 29:43.649
I thought you were
Silicon Valley egghead.

29:43.682 --> 29:45.184
True.

29:45.217 --> 29:48.754
But I also have a Bachelor's
degree in geology.

29:48.787 --> 29:49.788
Thought I might go on this trip

29:49.822 --> 29:50.622
and find the next chalk emerald.

29:56.328 --> 29:57.964
Check this out.

29:57.997 --> 30:00.232
Yeah, it's an Indian bead, put it back.

30:00.266 --> 30:03.102
No, it's not an American Indian.

30:04.070 --> 30:04.904
It's like

30:06.105 --> 30:08.340
some type of little scarab.

30:09.441 --> 30:10.742
It's got markings, look at that.

30:10.776 --> 30:12.644
I said put it back.

30:12.678 --> 30:14.881
It's bad luck to disturb a spirit house.

30:14.914 --> 30:17.749
I don't need you jinxing
us the rest of this trip.

30:17.783 --> 30:21.620
Come on, let's catch up
with the rest of them.

30:24.323 --> 30:25.424
I'm coming.

30:49.415 --> 30:52.151
I get the feeling he's never
been here before.

30:52.184 --> 30:55.321
It's like he's pretending
to recognize things.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.656
I dunno, I trust him.

30:57.689 --> 31:00.126
Yeah, well, I have no idea where we are,

31:00.159 --> 31:03.095
or to be honest, where we're going.

31:04.596 --> 31:06.933
Well, if it makes you feel any better...

31:06.966 --> 31:09.535
I wouldn't let anything happen.

31:10.469 --> 31:12.638
We're gonna be fine, 'kay?

31:14.373 --> 31:15.207
Okay.

31:27.586 --> 31:28.988
Hey Drake, Drake.

31:31.057 --> 31:34.593
When exactly are we going
to Klingman's Dome?

31:34.626 --> 31:35.461
What?

31:36.428 --> 31:37.396
You don't wanna go there.

31:37.429 --> 31:39.565
Place is overrun with tourists.

31:39.598 --> 31:41.533
My dad said it's the most beautiful spot

31:41.567 --> 31:43.369
on the trail, I mean,
I have to go to it.

31:43.402 --> 31:44.903
That's not the way we're going.

31:44.937 --> 31:47.673
Well, that's the whole reason
I picked this hike.

31:47.706 --> 31:51.043
You don't need this Disneyland map.

31:51.077 --> 31:52.044
It's a joke.

31:52.078 --> 31:53.579
What are you doing?

31:53.612 --> 31:57.950
Trust me, you're gonna see
plenty of good things.

32:20.472 --> 32:21.640
Knock knock.

32:24.643 --> 32:25.477
You okay?

32:27.980 --> 32:29.581
He pisses me off.

32:30.582 --> 32:31.817
I mean,

32:31.850 --> 32:34.286
it's not the map, not really.

32:36.622 --> 32:38.090
It's just the one place my dad wanted

32:38.124 --> 32:41.127
to visit that he never got to go to.

32:44.763 --> 32:47.533
Come on, come back to the fire.

32:50.236 --> 32:51.870
No.

32:51.903 --> 32:53.639
No, I'm going to bed.

33:31.143 --> 33:31.977
Brian?

33:38.016 --> 33:38.850
Brian?

33:44.156 --> 33:44.990
Drake?

33:54.400 --> 33:56.268
Guys, this isn't funny.

35:05.504 --> 35:06.338
Drake!

35:08.240 --> 35:09.074
Drake!

35:10.242 --> 35:11.076
Drake!

36:26.985 --> 36:27.786
Jesus Christ.

36:34.993 --> 36:37.963
It's just a dead coyote, come on.

36:37.996 --> 36:39.731
What would do that?

36:40.932 --> 36:42.768
Where are it's eyes?

36:43.935 --> 36:45.371
Nature's funny, kid.

36:45.404 --> 36:47.973
I once saw a baby calf with two heads.

36:48.006 --> 36:49.641
Who can explain that?

36:49.675 --> 36:50.742
Come on, Zoe.

36:52.244 --> 36:53.078
Come on.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.235
Okay, okay.

37:59.177 --> 38:01.212
Payback's a bitch, dude.

38:01.246 --> 38:02.047
Up top.

38:04.383 --> 38:06.284
I'll get you a towel.

38:25.170 --> 38:26.338
Where's Drake?

38:27.773 --> 38:30.342
He was here a few minutes ago.

38:30.376 --> 38:31.977
His pack is gone.

38:35.347 --> 38:36.181
Drake.

38:38.016 --> 38:38.850
Drake.

38:39.685 --> 38:40.519
Drake.

38:41.453 --> 38:42.688
I'm gonna go look for him.

38:42.721 --> 38:44.356
I'll come with you.

38:44.390 --> 38:45.824
Dude.

38:45.857 --> 38:48.059
Do you have to do
everything that she does?

38:48.093 --> 38:48.927
What?

38:50.529 --> 38:51.363
Nothing.

39:02.841 --> 39:03.675
Drake.

39:12.418 --> 39:13.251
Hello.

40:10.809 --> 40:13.211
What are you doing?

40:14.412 --> 40:15.246
I...

40:16.281 --> 40:17.182
I was just...

40:18.383 --> 40:20.952
We didn't know where you were.

40:20.986 --> 40:22.721
Well, now you know.

40:23.589 --> 40:25.056
I...

40:25.090 --> 40:25.924
We...

40:28.059 --> 40:32.130
Dan was gonna take a group photo.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.432
Well.

40:34.466 --> 40:36.702
Were you afraid I left you?

40:37.969 --> 40:38.804
No.

40:40.105 --> 40:41.039
Course not.

41:21.179 --> 41:23.615
Hey guys, it's a camp site.

41:23.649 --> 41:27.252
It's a good sign, we
must be near the trail.

41:27.285 --> 41:28.720
Hello?

41:28.754 --> 41:29.755
Anyone here?

41:30.656 --> 41:31.823
Knock knock.

41:41.266 --> 41:45.537
Looks like they secured
everything before they left.

41:45.571 --> 41:47.005
Could be on a day hike.

41:47.038 --> 41:48.139
Yeah.

41:48.173 --> 41:50.408
Don't think they'd abandon it.

41:50.441 --> 41:52.210
Well, I say we camp here.

41:52.243 --> 41:54.112
Be good to be around some other hikers.

41:54.145 --> 41:56.114
I say we keep moving.

41:56.147 --> 41:56.882
No, no, no.

41:56.915 --> 41:57.849
I'm with Zoe.

41:57.883 --> 41:59.217
I'm beat.

41:59.250 --> 42:00.518
Everyone who's up for staying here

42:00.552 --> 42:02.954
and camping, raise your hand.

42:09.327 --> 42:10.629
Fine.

42:10.662 --> 42:11.496
Come on.

42:21.873 --> 42:23.308
I don't get it.

42:23.341 --> 42:27.345
Why would anyone leave
all their stuff out here?

42:27.378 --> 42:29.748
Maybe they're lost.

42:29.781 --> 42:31.082
Or a bear got 'em.

42:31.116 --> 42:33.785
Don't talk like that, it's bad luck.

42:33.819 --> 42:34.653
Sorry.

42:36.254 --> 42:38.724
Guys, I'm not feeling well.

42:38.757 --> 42:40.325
I think I'm gonna lie down.

42:40.358 --> 42:41.459
What's wrong?

42:41.492 --> 42:42.327
I dunno.

42:43.294 --> 42:46.264
I've got a killer headache.

42:46.297 --> 42:47.232
Hold on.

42:47.265 --> 42:48.700
I have something.

42:53.772 --> 42:55.774
You okay, man?

42:55.807 --> 42:57.275
Here, try these.

42:57.308 --> 42:58.644
Thanks.

42:58.677 --> 42:59.945
Yeah, I'm fine.

43:01.346 --> 43:02.848
Just need to rest.

43:04.883 --> 43:05.717
Night.

43:07.753 --> 43:09.587
Good night.

45:15.446 --> 45:16.281
Daddy?

45:47.078 --> 45:49.180
Cheese, go wake up Brian.

45:49.214 --> 45:51.216
I wanna get out of here.

45:53.785 --> 45:55.420
That's weird.

45:55.453 --> 45:57.722
Can't get a signal on this thing.

45:57.755 --> 45:58.890
Those GPS units?

45:58.924 --> 45:59.891
It's a scam.

45:59.925 --> 46:01.426
They use them to track you.

46:01.459 --> 46:03.628
All you need is a compass.

46:11.937 --> 46:14.405
Guys, something's wrong with Brian.

46:14.439 --> 46:15.640
What is it?

46:15.673 --> 46:18.143
I dunno, he looks really sick.

46:18.176 --> 46:19.010
Shit.

46:22.881 --> 46:24.782
Just give him some space, okay?

46:24.816 --> 46:26.184
I'm just trying to help.

46:26.217 --> 46:27.552
Well, don't.

46:27.585 --> 46:30.521
Brian, what's wrong?

46:30.555 --> 46:31.389
Jesus.

46:32.457 --> 46:33.758
What's wrong with him?

46:33.791 --> 46:35.193
Let me see him.

46:36.627 --> 46:37.462
Brian.

46:39.297 --> 46:40.531
My God.

46:42.067 --> 46:43.301
Will someone tell me
what's wrong with him?

46:43.334 --> 46:45.770
Drake, we need to get him to a doctor.

46:45.803 --> 46:46.704
Now.

46:46.737 --> 46:48.073
There are no doctors here

46:48.106 --> 46:49.140
What's wrong with him?

46:49.174 --> 46:50.041
He's really sick.

46:50.075 --> 46:51.276
What are we gonna do?

46:51.309 --> 46:53.044
What we're gonna do is not panic, okay?

46:53.078 --> 46:55.280
Then we need to figure
out what our options are.

46:55.313 --> 46:57.182
We need to get him to a doctor.

46:57.215 --> 46:59.050
Hello, we're three days from anywhere.

46:59.084 --> 47:00.318
Fine, listen.

47:01.486 --> 47:02.687
I'll go for help, you guys stay here.

47:02.720 --> 47:03.955
You'll be fine.

47:05.456 --> 47:07.458
What are you doing, huh?

47:16.634 --> 47:17.668
What are you looking for?

47:17.702 --> 47:19.370
What do you think?

47:22.340 --> 47:23.174
Jackpot.

47:43.228 --> 47:44.295
What is this?

47:45.897 --> 47:47.632
Injections.

47:47.665 --> 47:49.667
Label's been peeled off.

47:51.402 --> 47:52.670
Look at this.

47:54.705 --> 47:56.241
Geiger counter?

47:56.274 --> 47:58.609
What campers need this stuff?

47:58.643 --> 48:00.578
These aren't campers.

48:00.611 --> 48:03.114
This is somebody on a mission.

48:08.786 --> 48:10.088
Not talking about this anymore.

48:10.121 --> 48:11.356
You guys stay put.

48:11.389 --> 48:12.390
I'm going for help.

48:12.423 --> 48:13.258
Wait.

48:14.659 --> 48:16.061
You have a phone.

48:17.963 --> 48:18.796
I saw it.

48:20.198 --> 48:24.469
At the falls, you have a
satellite phone in your bag.

48:24.502 --> 48:25.403
You don't know what
you're talking about.

48:25.436 --> 48:26.938
Gimme the phone.

48:26.972 --> 48:28.406
- I said it doesn't work.
- Gimme the phone, Drake.

48:28.439 --> 48:29.607
Drake.

48:30.508 --> 48:31.776
Stupid bitch.

48:32.643 --> 48:33.444
- Zoe.
- Give it to me.

48:37.715 --> 48:39.350
Drake, get off of her.

48:39.384 --> 48:40.651
Calm down.

48:40.685 --> 48:42.120
Get off of her.

48:43.221 --> 48:44.189
Damn it.

49:14.319 --> 49:17.555
Come on, get me out of this,
my eyes are burning.

49:27.565 --> 49:28.633
It won't connect.

49:28.666 --> 49:29.734
What are we gonna do?

49:29.767 --> 49:32.270
I told you, it doesn't work.

49:33.638 --> 49:35.373
Do you think I'm gonna go blind?

49:35.406 --> 49:36.741
Of course not.

49:38.176 --> 49:39.677
Look, I'm really sorry, but
what was I supposed to do,

49:39.710 --> 49:41.879
let him bash your head in?

49:47.018 --> 49:49.287
Found this in Drake's bag.

49:51.556 --> 49:55.460
Jesus, he was convicted of manslaughter?

49:55.493 --> 49:57.595
What, he killed somebody?

49:57.628 --> 49:59.597
Somebody, please, come on.

49:59.630 --> 50:01.466
Can we please shut him up?

50:25.856 --> 50:30.027
You have to flush it out,
flush out my eyes with water.

50:30.061 --> 50:31.129
Flush it out.

50:43.608 --> 50:45.143
Hey.

50:45.176 --> 50:49.347
Somebody's gotta go for
help, or Brian's gonna die.

50:53.451 --> 50:54.285
Zoe.

50:58.989 --> 51:00.425
Any luck with the phone?

51:00.458 --> 51:02.793
Nothing, it's dead.

51:03.661 --> 51:05.563
We need to find help.

51:09.134 --> 51:11.169
I'm gonna go you, guys
stay here with Brian.

51:11.202 --> 51:12.803
What about Drake?

51:13.838 --> 51:15.540
Keep him tied up.

51:15.573 --> 51:17.642
He'll be fine 'til I get back.

51:17.675 --> 51:19.310
Where you going, huh?

51:19.344 --> 51:20.845
You gonna wander through the woods,

51:20.878 --> 51:22.513
looking for civilization?

51:22.547 --> 51:23.814
No map, no GPS?

51:24.749 --> 51:26.251
You won't survive.

51:27.452 --> 51:30.755
I'm the only one that
knows these mountains.

51:35.693 --> 51:36.527
Come on!

51:40.097 --> 51:41.098
Untie him.

52:04.822 --> 52:05.756
Fuck.

52:05.790 --> 52:06.624
Get up.

52:14.399 --> 52:15.233
Drake.

52:16.401 --> 52:17.268
Drake.

52:17.302 --> 52:18.135
What?

52:19.304 --> 52:22.740
Something happened to us, didn't it?

52:22.773 --> 52:25.610
The night after Strawberry Fields?

52:29.747 --> 52:30.648
I remember.

52:36.287 --> 52:38.523
It was not a dream, was it?

52:40.291 --> 52:41.125
No.

52:43.528 --> 52:44.362
It wasn't.

52:48.199 --> 52:51.436
I didn't think anybody else remembered.

52:52.770 --> 52:55.005
I didn't want you to panic.

52:59.310 --> 53:00.645
Wait a minute.

53:02.046 --> 53:03.047
What is happening?

53:03.080 --> 53:04.349
I don't know.

53:06.083 --> 53:07.151
I don't know.

53:56.267 --> 53:57.502
Who did that?

53:59.637 --> 54:01.906
It doesn't look Cherokee.

54:20.057 --> 54:22.126
I've heard of this place.

54:23.628 --> 54:25.963
Phil called it Beacon Point.

54:30.435 --> 54:32.870
I didn't think it actually existed.

55:07.605 --> 55:08.506
You okay?

55:10.675 --> 55:12.343
I was such a dick.

55:13.978 --> 55:18.282
I mean, all I wanted to do
was hang out with my brother.

55:18.315 --> 55:20.551
Look, he's gonna be okay.

55:21.619 --> 55:24.288
They're gonna bring help.

55:24.321 --> 55:26.323
Hell, Cheese, I'll airlift him out

55:26.357 --> 55:28.926
with a helicopter if I have to.

55:31.061 --> 55:33.898
I've never been in a helicopter.

55:36.801 --> 55:37.735
Check this out.

55:37.768 --> 55:40.004
I think this the garnet.

55:40.037 --> 55:40.905
Really?

55:40.938 --> 55:42.440
Is it worth anything?

55:42.473 --> 55:45.142
Probably not, ones that small.

55:46.544 --> 55:50.280
But you never know when you
might find a ruby or an emerald.

55:52.550 --> 55:54.218
Now, check this out.

55:59.023 --> 56:01.325
It's definitely not Native American,
I can tell you that.

56:01.358 --> 56:04.495
It's, like, some sort of scarab.

56:04.529 --> 56:07.064
Hold it up to the light,
there's something inside it.

56:07.097 --> 56:07.932
Strange.

56:12.603 --> 56:14.505
What is that, a wire?

57:10.861 --> 57:11.696
Hello?

58:03.581 --> 58:04.414
Drake.

58:07.151 --> 58:08.318
Where are we?

58:12.590 --> 58:13.423
Oh shit.

58:17.628 --> 58:19.129
Where's my pack?

58:20.798 --> 58:23.901
It had all of our food in it, it had...

58:23.934 --> 58:25.469
Oh my God, we have to find it.

58:25.502 --> 58:26.704
Drake.

58:26.737 --> 58:27.805
I feel off.

58:30.007 --> 58:30.841
My head.

58:52.763 --> 58:53.864
Stop, stop.

58:55.499 --> 58:56.601
You hear that?

58:58.969 --> 58:59.970
It's people.

59:06.811 --> 59:07.645
Zoe?

59:14.184 --> 59:15.419
Oh my God.

59:15.452 --> 59:18.155
We've been walking in circles.

59:18.188 --> 59:19.023
Circles.

59:23.227 --> 59:24.061
Brian?

59:24.995 --> 59:26.563
Hey.

59:26.597 --> 59:28.666
Oh my God, are you okay?

59:28.699 --> 59:30.034
Oh, easy.

59:30.067 --> 59:30.901
Yeah.

59:30.935 --> 59:31.869
I'm better.

59:35.706 --> 59:37.207
Okay, we need to get out of here

59:37.241 --> 59:38.375
and get back on the main trail.

59:38.408 --> 59:40.377
Guys, I don't wanna be here anymore.

59:40.410 --> 59:42.012
No, I have to go back.

59:42.046 --> 59:43.347
Forget it.

59:43.380 --> 59:44.882
No, you don't understand,
I left my pack.

59:44.915 --> 59:46.416
Forget that crap,
I'll buy you a new one.

59:46.450 --> 59:47.718
No, I have to go back.

59:47.752 --> 59:48.953
I need my stuff.

59:48.986 --> 59:50.487
No, I understand, we
need to get out of here.

59:50.520 --> 59:52.256
It's my dad.

59:52.289 --> 59:53.824
Okay?

59:53.858 --> 59:55.760
I have his ashes, and I was gonna

59:55.793 --> 59:57.161
scatter them at Klingman's Dome,

59:57.194 --> 01:00:01.565
that's the whole reason
that I picked this hike.

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:03.100
I have to go back.

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:08.172
I'll come with you.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:10.875
Me too.

01:00:11.909 --> 01:00:12.877
I don't believe this.

01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:14.311
Really?

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:15.345
Let me go.

01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:25.856
You can't leave me here like this.

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:28.458
Fine.

01:00:30.327 --> 01:00:31.628
Go.

01:00:31.662 --> 01:00:33.163
We don't need you.

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:26.050
Hey, I can't do this anymore.

01:01:27.151 --> 01:01:28.819
I need to rest soon.

01:01:34.892 --> 01:01:36.160
Help.

01:01:36.193 --> 01:01:37.661
Sam, are you okay?

01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:38.863
I'm fine.

01:01:38.896 --> 01:01:40.430
Please, just cut me down.

01:01:40.464 --> 01:01:41.799
Yeah, hang on.

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:48.873
My God, Dan.

01:02:07.591 --> 01:02:09.426
It's not your fault.

01:02:12.396 --> 01:02:13.230
Zoe.

01:02:15.465 --> 01:02:16.300
Zoe.

01:03:11.488 --> 01:03:13.457
What is that?

01:03:16.793 --> 01:03:20.230
Come on, keep moving,
it's not safe here.

01:03:33.543 --> 01:03:34.378
Brian.

01:03:36.446 --> 01:03:38.382
Come on, we gotta get him
out of here, come on.

01:03:38.415 --> 01:03:39.249
Come on.

01:03:40.284 --> 01:03:42.286
It's okay, bear with me.

01:03:55.499 --> 01:03:56.300
Brian.

01:03:57.801 --> 01:03:58.635
Brian.

01:04:00.037 --> 01:04:03.540
No, it's okay, it's okay,
it's okay, calm down.

01:04:03.573 --> 01:04:05.009
Brian, it's okay.

01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:06.743
Sh.

01:04:09.313 --> 01:04:10.147
Sh.

01:04:27.998 --> 01:04:29.499
Zoe.

01:04:29.533 --> 01:04:30.634
Zoe, wake up.

01:04:32.736 --> 01:04:33.904
Where's Brian?

01:04:35.305 --> 01:04:36.140
What?

01:04:39.043 --> 01:04:40.510
What?

01:04:41.778 --> 01:04:42.612
Brian.

01:04:44.214 --> 01:04:45.049
Brian!

01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:46.984
Brian?

01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:57.561
Brian!

01:05:08.172 --> 01:05:09.006
Brian.

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:14.678
Brian.

01:05:18.315 --> 01:05:19.149
Cheese.

01:05:27.324 --> 01:05:28.158
Oh my God.

01:05:34.498 --> 01:05:36.700
This is your fault.

01:05:36.733 --> 01:05:37.968
We could have been rescued by now

01:05:38.002 --> 01:05:39.903
if you hadn't made us come back here.

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:41.105
No.

01:05:41.138 --> 01:05:42.339
You knew this place was dangerous,

01:05:42.372 --> 01:05:43.573
and you brought us here
anyways, and for what?

01:05:43.607 --> 01:05:46.243
For your dead dad, are you serious?

01:05:47.744 --> 01:05:49.079
I had a brother.

01:05:51.181 --> 01:05:53.617
And he's dead because of you.

01:05:57.087 --> 01:05:58.088
Cheese.

01:05:58.122 --> 01:05:59.556
Stay away from me.

01:05:59.589 --> 01:06:00.424
Please.

01:06:11.868 --> 01:06:12.702
I'm sorry.

01:06:14.138 --> 01:06:15.805
I'll come back.

01:06:15.839 --> 01:06:16.673
I promise.

01:07:58.542 --> 01:07:59.376
Drake.

01:08:03.947 --> 01:08:05.515
What are you doing?

01:08:08.017 --> 01:08:08.952
In there.

01:08:15.359 --> 01:08:17.161
What is it?

01:08:20.363 --> 01:08:21.930
Go on, take a look.

01:08:24.334 --> 01:08:26.336
What are you gonna do?

01:08:28.071 --> 01:08:28.872
Do?

01:08:30.607 --> 01:08:31.408
Look at me.

01:08:32.276 --> 01:08:33.443
What can I do?

01:08:38.348 --> 01:08:40.417
Do whatever you want.

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:42.519
But let's just say

01:08:42.551 --> 01:08:45.054
you might find what you're lookin' for.

01:08:45.087 --> 01:08:47.323
Stay away from me, Drake.

01:08:49.326 --> 01:08:50.260
I just wanna help.

01:08:50.294 --> 01:08:52.796
No, I am serious, stay back.

01:08:53.729 --> 01:08:54.663
Go, look.

01:08:59.068 --> 01:09:00.069
You first.

01:09:12.015 --> 01:09:15.618
There's nothin' you
can do to me, Barbie.

01:09:17.621 --> 01:09:19.055
I'm already dead.

01:10:22.419 --> 01:10:24.754
Pretty weird, isn't it?

01:10:24.788 --> 01:10:26.055
What is this?

01:10:27.424 --> 01:10:31.995
At first, I thought
it was an old gold mine.

01:10:32.028 --> 01:10:33.797
Now, I'm not so sure.

01:10:37.867 --> 01:10:39.769
All that stuff was there.

01:10:39.803 --> 01:10:41.137
All hiking gear.

01:10:46.843 --> 01:10:48.077
Who did this?

01:10:49.813 --> 01:10:50.747
You know.

01:10:55.184 --> 01:10:56.219
Look at this.

01:11:04.661 --> 01:11:07.731
This was at the camp site.

01:11:07.764 --> 01:11:09.599
Don't you get it?

01:11:09.633 --> 01:11:11.401
This was no accident.

01:11:12.436 --> 01:11:15.472
They know every move we make.

01:11:15.505 --> 01:11:16.673
Don't you see?

01:11:18.141 --> 01:11:20.644
They've been here for generations.

01:11:20.677 --> 01:11:21.678
Watching us.

01:11:22.646 --> 01:11:23.647
Studying us.

01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:29.018
They see everything we see.

01:11:30.987 --> 01:11:31.888
What we do.

01:11:33.222 --> 01:11:36.493
Where we go, how we live, they see all.

01:11:37.827 --> 01:11:38.662
Look.

01:11:41.465 --> 01:11:42.466
Oh my God.

01:11:50.407 --> 01:11:51.240
How?

01:11:52.809 --> 01:11:53.710
Our eyes.

01:12:00.717 --> 01:12:04.888
They use our eyes like
cameras to spy on us.

01:12:04.921 --> 01:12:05.755
Drake.

01:12:07.791 --> 01:12:10.660
You know what I'm saying is true.

01:12:10.694 --> 01:12:11.928
You were there?

01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:14.798
Remember!?

01:12:18.034 --> 01:12:18.868
Yes.

01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:22.138
We got sick.

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:24.974
That wasn't supposed to happen.

01:12:25.008 --> 01:12:27.377
But you and Cheese, you didn't get sick.

01:12:27.411 --> 01:12:28.612
Why?

01:12:28.645 --> 01:12:29.713
I don't know.

01:12:29.746 --> 01:12:31.014
Let me see your eyes.

01:12:31.047 --> 01:12:32.015
No.

01:12:32.048 --> 01:12:32.949
Let me see your eyes!

01:12:32.982 --> 01:12:34.183
Stay away from me, Drake.

01:12:34.217 --> 01:12:35.652
I feel them inside of me.

01:12:35.685 --> 01:12:38.788
Like parasites, like a poison.

01:12:38.822 --> 01:12:40.156
I won't let them do this to me.

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:41.024
I won't!

01:12:44.461 --> 01:12:45.529
No, Drake!

01:13:48.157 --> 01:13:48.992
Cheese.

01:13:50.594 --> 01:13:51.427
Cheese.

01:13:52.662 --> 01:13:54.163
Cheese.

01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:57.266
Cheese.

01:14:28.031 --> 01:14:28.832
Oh my God.

01:14:28.865 --> 01:14:30.133
You scared me.

01:14:30.166 --> 01:14:32.468
We were wondering if
you were coming back.

01:14:32.502 --> 01:14:33.302
What?

01:14:33.336 --> 01:14:35.338
Is that yours?

01:14:35.371 --> 01:14:38.975
No, this is my friend's,
he's about 17, 18 years old.

01:14:39.008 --> 01:14:40.243
Have you guys seen him?

01:14:40.276 --> 01:14:41.745
No, we haven't seen anyone.

01:14:41.778 --> 01:14:44.080
We noticed the tent
yesterday when we got here.

01:14:44.113 --> 01:14:45.615
We're just right over there.

01:14:45.649 --> 01:14:47.784
You're welcome to join us and wait.

01:14:47.817 --> 01:14:48.852
No.

01:14:48.885 --> 01:14:49.719
Thank you.

01:14:51.655 --> 01:14:53.623
Do you know the way to the main trail?

01:14:53.657 --> 01:14:55.091
Yeah.

01:14:55.124 --> 01:14:56.359
Just a couple hundred yards
that way, can't miss it.

01:14:56.392 --> 01:14:58.061
Okay, thank you.

01:14:58.094 --> 01:15:02.265
Klingman's Dome is about
three miles up that trail.
