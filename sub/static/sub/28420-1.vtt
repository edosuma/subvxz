00:59.001 --> 01:00.917
No problem. Think about it.

01:01.084 --> 01:03.042
I'm sure I sent it.

01:47.792 --> 01:49.584
Thank you! Thanks.

02:24.042 --> 02:25.834
THE VAGABOND

02:36.042 --> 02:38.709
Ella, Oscar.
You know Schirmer is leaving,

02:39.501 --> 02:41.792
"finally" we can safely say.

02:41.959 --> 02:43.417
Management agrees.

02:44.001 --> 02:48.251
Both of you are qualified
to take over as editor-in-chief.

02:48.417 --> 02:50.584
But I can only promote one of you.

02:50.751 --> 02:54.834
Ella, you're a creative powerhouse.

02:55.792 --> 02:59.959
When it comes to pushing your writing,
you have the necessary tenacity.

03:00.126 --> 03:02.751
You trained Oscar well.

03:03.959 --> 03:06.417
When I spoke to Oscar,

03:06.584 --> 03:10.251
he said that you hope...

03:10.417 --> 03:13.917
to progress with your family planning.

03:14.376 --> 03:18.042
Yes, but what does that
have to do with this?

03:18.876 --> 03:21.501
A family, sure.
But it's nothing to do with work.

03:22.209 --> 03:23.792
- Right?
- Everything...

03:23.959 --> 03:26.584
has to do with everything.

03:27.167 --> 03:30.542
Ella, life and work
stem from multiple causes.

03:30.709 --> 03:33.334
If you want to start a family,

03:33.501 --> 03:37.126
then you need
to occasionally get together.

03:38.834 --> 03:40.292
In the evening.

03:41.459 --> 03:43.751
So you're saying,

03:43.917 --> 03:45.667
Oscar will head up editorial,

03:45.834 --> 03:47.417
while I wait for him at home?

03:47.584 --> 03:49.792
Ella, don't take it personally.

03:49.959 --> 03:52.959
It's about in-house
processes and decisions.

03:53.126 --> 03:56.501
It's got nothing to do
with our personal life.

03:56.667 --> 03:58.876
You can't blame Harald.

04:01.042 --> 04:02.167
No.

04:02.334 --> 04:03.751
Well then...

04:06.042 --> 04:07.251
congratulations!

04:07.417 --> 04:08.626
Ella.

04:11.334 --> 04:12.334
Hey.

04:12.501 --> 04:13.751
Hey What?

04:15.084 --> 04:18.750
You discussed us with him
behind my back to push your career?

04:18.916 --> 04:21.666
We were just talking on the fly.

04:21.834 --> 04:23.376
Let's discuss it at home.

04:23.542 --> 04:27.167
Why? You just heard that
everything is connected.

04:27.334 --> 04:29.126
I thought we were a team, Oscar.

04:29.292 --> 04:30.959
- Only when it suits you.
- What?

04:31.126 --> 04:33.209
I'd be fine with you getting the job.

04:33.376 --> 04:36.209
- I'd be happy for you.
- That's not true.

04:36.376 --> 04:37.959
See, you don't know me at all.

04:38.126 --> 04:41.459
How could I?
We don't sleep together anymore.

04:41.626 --> 04:43.126
We haven't had sex in months.

04:43.292 --> 04:45.709
No sex, no pregnancy.
No pregnancy, no child.

04:45.876 --> 04:49.084
- Bye.
- Bye, see you tomorrow... Caspar.

04:50.084 --> 04:52.417
You're pressuring me,
I can't think with you.

04:52.584 --> 04:54.709
Don't think, act.

04:54.876 --> 04:56.751
It doesn't work that way for me.

04:56.917 --> 04:59.292
Enough of the child and career shit.
You're so...

04:59.459 --> 05:02.209
- Don't you dare say dominant and boring.
- No.

05:06.084 --> 05:07.834
I just can't think with you.

05:11.292 --> 05:13.126
Who can you think with?

05:26.501 --> 05:28.084
Say it's not true.

05:30.001 --> 05:31.917
I didn't mean to do it.

05:36.709 --> 05:38.251
Ella, let's not do this.

05:39.584 --> 05:42.626
Crying is like laughing,
only the other way around.

06:18.626 --> 06:20.667
I can be happy without you.

06:30.042 --> 06:31.042
Totally!

06:33.751 --> 06:35.667
I don't have anything, go away!

06:37.292 --> 06:38.751
Go, get lost!

06:38.917 --> 06:40.167
Puck, Puck!

06:40.334 --> 06:41.667
Puck, come here.

06:42.751 --> 06:45.709
He's a cute guy. He's a...

06:46.626 --> 06:48.167
what's the breed?

06:48.334 --> 06:50.917
Looks like a very smart dog.

06:52.126 --> 06:53.459
How are you today?

06:53.626 --> 06:55.167
- Great. You?
- Good.

06:55.334 --> 06:57.167
Mr. Simon!

06:57.751 --> 06:58.751
Yoohoo!

07:00.709 --> 07:02.834
Oh, am I glad to see you.

07:03.667 --> 07:05.084
You're my savior.

07:07.209 --> 07:10.209
Mr. Simon, and up so early.

07:14.501 --> 07:16.834
My heart, it's...

07:18.334 --> 07:20.917
I'm feeling a bit unwell.

07:23.334 --> 07:25.292
Take me home, please.

07:26.084 --> 07:30.251
- Mrs. Klein, what are you doing here?
- I guess I overdid it.

07:30.417 --> 07:33.167
I really wanted fresh flowers.

07:33.334 --> 07:35.584
The spirit is willing, flesh is weak.

07:36.584 --> 07:38.917
Let's How's it work?

07:39.042 --> 07:41.084
I sit, you push. Simple.

07:41.251 --> 07:42.959
Go. How hard can it be?

07:44.459 --> 07:46.126
Turn, turn.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.251
- What?
- My dog.

07:57.417 --> 07:58.417
Elfriede!

08:00.042 --> 08:01.792
Come to Mommy!

08:09.001 --> 08:12.834
You're doing an outstanding job,
Mr. Simon. Outstanding.

08:13.001 --> 08:14.501
Excellent.

08:16.709 --> 08:19.376
But you're not paying attention.

08:19.542 --> 08:21.459
I only have eyes for you, Mrs. Klein.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.876
My body's an old wrapper.

08:24.042 --> 08:26.542
I'd leave it in a sec if I could.

08:27.209 --> 08:29.292
And slip into that one.

08:30.001 --> 08:31.334
Yeah...

08:32.292 --> 08:35.833
Why don't you come visit anymore?
For an eggnog, Mr. Neighbor?

08:36.001 --> 08:38.333
Lately, I don't have much time.

08:38.501 --> 08:39.333
I see.

08:39.501 --> 08:41.501
Sometimes you just have to forget.

08:41.667 --> 08:43.251
- Yes.
- Yes, yes.

08:43.417 --> 08:44.876
We had to.

08:45.042 --> 08:46.876
We lost everything.

08:47.042 --> 08:51.334
You have to keep looking
to the future.

08:52.209 --> 08:53.251
Mrs. Klein?

08:53.959 --> 08:55.459
Hey, Mrs. Klein?

09:00.084 --> 09:01.084
Doctor!

09:02.001 --> 09:03.626
I need a doctor!

09:03.792 --> 09:04.792
Shit.

09:23.959 --> 09:25.084
Simpson,

09:25.709 --> 09:28.751
please don't jump up
on Max again when he comes home.

09:28.917 --> 09:30.542
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.

09:31.042 --> 09:33.001
Go to your spot, go!

09:34.709 --> 09:36.584
Where's your spot? Go.

09:42.459 --> 09:43.876
Daddy's coming!

09:47.084 --> 09:48.792
- Hello.
- Hello.

09:50.292 --> 09:51.626
I missed you.

09:54.959 --> 09:56.667
Hello, I'm back!

09:59.417 --> 10:00.167
Daddy!

10:00.334 --> 10:03.209
Pretty.
Very pretty piece you're playing.

10:15.417 --> 10:18.542
Hey, my little E.T. Did you miss me?

10:21.709 --> 10:24.417
Hey. I didn't say
"alien" this time, right?

10:25.209 --> 10:26.542
How was the concert?

10:26.709 --> 10:28.209
It went great.

10:28.792 --> 10:33.001
- Did you play your own composition?
- Of course I played it. Natch.

10:35.626 --> 10:37.292
Simpson, stop!

10:40.959 --> 10:42.459
This is impossible, really!

10:42.626 --> 10:45.251
He attacks me every time!
I'm scared.

10:45.417 --> 10:49.001
- I'll take him to obedience school.
- You don't get it. I'm scared!

10:49.167 --> 10:51.709
Take him to the garage. Now!

10:51.876 --> 10:54.417
Yes, I'm taking him to the garage now.

10:54.584 --> 10:55.709
Come.

10:56.126 --> 10:57.626
Come, come!

10:58.584 --> 11:00.334
Simpson, now calm down.

11:01.917 --> 11:03.667
Sorry. I overreacted a little.

11:03.834 --> 11:07.667
I understand. I'll take him to Silke.
She'll know what to do.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.876
An old dog can't learn new tricks.

11:10.042 --> 11:11.876
Neither can an old man.

11:12.501 --> 11:13.501
Come on.

11:20.251 --> 11:21.792
Oh, shit.

11:24.501 --> 11:26.292
Oli, hey man!

11:28.001 --> 11:29.001
Mickels!

11:29.501 --> 11:31.584
How's it going? All good?

11:32.584 --> 11:33.959
- Yeah, all good.
- Oli?

11:34.126 --> 11:37.667
Is that you?
Didn't recognize you, with a... dog.

11:37.834 --> 11:39.542
She is so cute!

11:39.709 --> 11:41.334
What's her name?

11:41.501 --> 11:43.001
Elfriede. But she's not mine.

11:43.167 --> 11:45.126
Whose is she?

11:45.292 --> 11:46.334
A friend's.

11:51.292 --> 11:53.667
So you guys are a couple now?

11:56.626 --> 11:57.626
Heya.

11:58.751 --> 12:00.459
Boy, Oli's gotten really fat.

12:00.626 --> 12:03.209
You know what she's like.
She has standards.

12:03.667 --> 12:05.792
- And what about your ex?
- Fahle.

12:05.959 --> 12:08.126
- And Fahle's ex?
- Takkowicz.

12:08.292 --> 12:10.751
- Everything back the way it was.
- Yeah, all cool.

12:10.917 --> 12:12.751
- It's cool.
- Cool, man.

12:12.917 --> 12:14.834
We're going to "Stue." Wanna come?

12:15.001 --> 12:16.501
No, no. I don't have time.

12:16.667 --> 12:18.459
No time, no time.

12:18.626 --> 12:20.667
Oli, hang on.

12:21.542 --> 12:23.626
You used to throw such great parties.

12:23.792 --> 12:25.417
With gorgeous women.

12:26.751 --> 12:29.584
But if I'd been through that,
with the knee...

12:29.751 --> 12:31.292
it really sucks.

12:32.209 --> 12:34.126
I would've killed myself.

12:37.501 --> 12:39.542
Whatever. Take care, man.

12:39.709 --> 12:41.126
- You're Mickels...
- Yep.

12:41.292 --> 12:44.167
<i>Awesome. How about a same'? Phase'.!</i>

12:44.334 --> 12:45.751
Sure, come on.

12:47.167 --> 12:49.417
Brilliant! Wasn't that whosit?
Oli Simon?

12:49.584 --> 12:51.626
No, that's a dog walker.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.334
Go on, fill it up. Thanks!

12:58.501 --> 13:01.751
What annoys me the most
is I have to start from scratch.

13:01.917 --> 13:04.626
Everything out there
is unfit for bonding. Junk!

13:04.792 --> 13:06.959
Ella, don't be so pessimistic.

13:07.126 --> 13:08.709
- Pessimistic?
- Wake up!

13:08.876 --> 13:10.542
Believe in the stars.

13:10.709 --> 13:12.001
Those are light bulbs.

13:12.167 --> 13:13.667
Ella wants a family.

13:13.834 --> 13:16.417
A nuclear one. Father, mother, two kids.

13:16.584 --> 13:18.292
Her biological clock is ticking.

13:18.459 --> 13:21.542
- Aren't all of ours?
- Let them tick.

13:21.709 --> 13:23.834
If you're really in a hurry,

13:24.001 --> 13:26.376
get a child first,
then go look for a man.

13:26.542 --> 13:27.959
Turkey baster method.

13:28.126 --> 13:30.876
You can do that,
then you get to decide everything.

13:31.042 --> 13:34.542
But it's best when you
fuse symbiotically with your partner.

13:34.709 --> 13:37.667
And at the right time, that intimacy.

13:37.834 --> 13:41.376
When you
see the world together as one.

13:41.542 --> 13:43.667
Look who's talking.

13:43.834 --> 13:45.751
Are you even still having sex?

13:46.834 --> 13:48.501
Are you or not?

13:49.251 --> 13:50.084
- Yes.
- Really?

13:50.251 --> 13:51.251
- Yes?
- Yes, really.

13:51.376 --> 13:52.417
- You are?
- You are?

13:52.584 --> 13:54.334
- Yesterday.
- Really?

13:55.126 --> 13:57.876
Against a warm wall
behind the house.

13:58.626 --> 13:59.792
It was really hot.

13:59.959 --> 14:02.251
Then we moved to the washing machine.

14:03.584 --> 14:07.001
- Then doggy style.
- Isn't he in Malmö?

14:08.292 --> 14:10.917
Silke, why are you
in such a bad mood?

14:11.084 --> 14:12.834
I'm not. I'm realistic.

14:14.167 --> 14:16.459
That's enough realism.

14:16.626 --> 14:18.876
- Let's read the cards, okay?
- Oh, no.

14:24.417 --> 14:26.542
Good start. That represents love.

14:30.542 --> 14:32.626
- That represents success.
- Yes!

14:34.751 --> 14:36.251
Oh, shit! Not a dog.

14:36.417 --> 14:39.959
- Don't say shit dog, or I'll say shit cat.
- Why? What does dog mean?

14:41.209 --> 14:42.792
- Follow the dog.
- You see!

14:44.209 --> 14:45.542
Dog.

14:55.084 --> 14:57.459
You just drop by, no warning?

14:57.626 --> 15:00.251
I was in the neighborhood.
Don't complicate things.

15:00.417 --> 15:03.667
I'm not.
But I could have had another man here.

15:03.834 --> 15:05.959
But you don't... do you?

15:10.126 --> 15:12.167
- I came to get the records.
- Why? No.

15:12.334 --> 15:16.542
- You don't have a record player anymore.
- But I did! For five years.

15:16.709 --> 15:17.876
We bought it together.

15:18.042 --> 15:21.917
Like we moved in together,
so we could have kids together.

15:22.084 --> 15:25.251
But Ella, it didn't work out. Together.

15:28.917 --> 15:30.501
- I'll get the records.
- No!

15:30.667 --> 15:33.167
- You never listened to them.
- Not true!

15:33.334 --> 15:34.751
- Maybe one...
- Leave them!

15:34.917 --> 15:38.084
Calm down! This isn't
about the records for you.

15:38.251 --> 15:40.959
Of course it is!
I don't want you taking them!

15:41.126 --> 15:43.626
They're just gathering dust. Look!

15:43.792 --> 15:47.584
- You're not taking the records!
- So let them gather dust here.

15:49.417 --> 15:51.709
Yes, they'll gather dust. Yes.

15:52.292 --> 15:53.792
Gather dust...

16:11.334 --> 16:13.667
BERLIN ANIMAL SHELTER

16:23.917 --> 16:25.084
- Yes?
- Hello.

16:25.251 --> 16:27.376
I want to adopt an abandoned dog.

16:27.542 --> 16:31.501
This is an animal shelter.
All the animals are abandoned.

16:31.667 --> 16:33.042
Yes, I know.

16:34.792 --> 16:39.626
But, listen, I want the most abandoned
creature that's ever been left here.

16:41.334 --> 16:45.334
A tormented dog,
who was left unloved overnight,

16:45.501 --> 16:48.417
and all his doggy dreams suddenly burst.

16:48.751 --> 16:52.584
The dog felt so miserable,
he considered jumping off a bridge.

16:52.751 --> 16:55.251
But then he decided
that wasn't the answer.

16:58.084 --> 17:00.417
I'm looking for the world's saddest dog.

17:01.126 --> 17:04.376
The hard to place ones.
Those are the really sad cases.

17:14.459 --> 17:17.584
Hey, Bozer!
I've got another new mistress for you.

17:19.501 --> 17:22.584
- He's the saddest you've got?
- Yep, he always runs away.

17:23.001 --> 17:27.166
The other sad ones are too old for you.
You'd cry when it died.

17:31.376 --> 17:33.792
So you were abandoned? Me too.

17:36.417 --> 17:38.626
All I need is somebody reliable.

17:40.167 --> 17:41.459
Is that you?

17:43.292 --> 17:46.251
I want to live with
someone I can rely on.

17:47.792 --> 17:48.792
Bozer,

17:49.667 --> 17:51.126
is that you?

18:24.959 --> 18:26.042
What's up?

18:26.209 --> 18:29.792
Your dog jumped out back at the light
and ran into the woods.

18:31.501 --> 18:33.292
- It should be in restraints!
- Shit.

18:55.334 --> 18:58.584
- This has to come off.
- The jewelry stays, or I'll get sicker.

19:01.584 --> 19:03.792
Ah, a visitor for you too.

19:03.959 --> 19:05.501
Mr. Simon!

19:07.792 --> 19:09.126
What...

19:09.292 --> 19:12.126
Oh, Elfriede, Elfriede, my darling!

19:12.292 --> 19:14.334
Oh darling, give Mommy a kiss.

19:20.001 --> 19:22.001
She's been de-wormed.

19:23.167 --> 19:26.084
Put her away, down there.

19:26.251 --> 19:28.751
Nurse Aina Miller is very strict.

19:31.667 --> 19:33.626
Mr. Simon, I'm sorry,

19:33.792 --> 19:36.167
you have to keep her another two weeks.

19:36.334 --> 19:39.459
- The doctor says I have to rest.
- Two weeks?

19:39.626 --> 19:42.542
- Mrs. Klein, I'm not good with dogs.
- Yes you are!

19:42.709 --> 19:45.751
And you'll meet
lots of charming women.

19:46.542 --> 19:48.459
Just like I met charming men.

19:48.626 --> 19:50.334
You need to get out.

19:50.501 --> 19:52.459
And if it really doesn't work out,

19:52.626 --> 19:56.751
take her to the Happy Dogs kennel.

19:57.417 --> 20:00.084
Grab my wallet out of my bag,

20:01.917 --> 20:04.917
and take five banknotes.

20:05.084 --> 20:06.751
I've only got one kind.

20:08.084 --> 20:11.584
- Mrs. Klein, there's at least...
- 800, I know.

20:12.334 --> 20:14.376
So no complaints.

20:14.542 --> 20:16.292
Hellooo!

20:16.459 --> 20:17.876
Reinhold!

20:18.042 --> 20:19.626
Did you bring my medicine?

20:19.792 --> 20:21.667
Of course.

20:23.792 --> 20:26.251
Why can't Reinhold look after Elfriede?

20:26.417 --> 20:28.084
Because I want it this way!

20:28.251 --> 20:29.834
Reinhold has to look after me.

20:30.834 --> 20:33.876
And Elfriede needs exercise.

20:34.709 --> 20:36.751
You used to be athletic, Mr. Simon.

20:37.959 --> 20:39.501
Open it.

20:40.376 --> 20:42.792
Pop the cork, let's hear a bang!

20:57.501 --> 20:58.501
Lost?

20:58.667 --> 21:00.334
Man, you scared me!

21:01.584 --> 21:03.417
In the forest, we are quiet.

21:05.501 --> 21:06.334
There he is.

21:06.501 --> 21:08.042
Yes, here he is.

21:09.209 --> 21:11.209
This is a tick risk area.

21:12.334 --> 21:13.917
Not a dog walking area.

21:14.834 --> 21:16.417
Where were you?

21:17.209 --> 21:18.334
See that sign?

21:20.376 --> 21:21.917
Yes. That's an owl.

21:22.792 --> 21:24.167
Exactly.

21:24.334 --> 21:26.292
- And an owl means...?
- Owl.

21:27.167 --> 21:28.376
Nature reserve.

21:28.959 --> 21:30.834
Keep the dog on a leash.

21:31.959 --> 21:34.167
Now best head out of the forest,

21:34.334 --> 21:37.459
and take your dog
to obedience school. Goodbye.

21:38.709 --> 21:40.417
Wait, wait, wait!

21:40.584 --> 21:43.334
If the dog is caught
poaching game, he'll be shot.

21:44.334 --> 21:46.792
You would bump off an animal?

21:46.959 --> 21:49.667
- Do you realize who I am?
- Who are you?

21:50.876 --> 21:52.126
The forest ranger.

21:56.542 --> 21:58.959
The big kahuna ranger!

22:06.334 --> 22:07.751
I'm sorry.

22:13.126 --> 22:15.126
What's this? Got yourself a toy dog?

22:15.292 --> 22:16.959
Should I let Beddy loose?

22:17.126 --> 22:18.542
I don't have it, Krüger.

22:18.709 --> 22:22.376
- Gambling debts get paid, man.
- He'll get his money. I need time.

22:23.292 --> 22:26.667
I used to treat you guys
to Moét at my parties.

22:26.834 --> 22:28.334
I never sent a bill.

22:28.501 --> 22:31.001
"Used to." You used to be
a soccer player, too.

22:31.167 --> 22:33.459
- Give me the money.
- Your boss'll get his dough.

22:36.876 --> 22:40.084
What do you think, doll?
Should we give Oli a little time?

22:45.542 --> 22:48.209
- Bonjour!
- Bonjour, Monsieur Oli. Stressed again?

22:48.376 --> 22:51.292
- What are you doing with Elfriede?
- Long story.

22:51.792 --> 22:53.626
Right, have a look around.

23:19.001 --> 23:21.584
You think this is a doggy play date?

23:23.209 --> 23:25.751
Look, there's a ball over there.
Go play.

23:26.792 --> 23:27.834
Over there.

24:11.751 --> 24:15.417
- My god, what an ugly brute.
- Hello, Mom. Always a pleasure.

24:15.584 --> 24:18.209
I don't get
why you want a dog in your situation.

24:20.876 --> 24:23.542
The Chinese say dogs stir up your qi.

24:24.209 --> 24:26.001
That's positive energy.

24:26.167 --> 24:28.667
Exactly what I need in my situation.

24:28.834 --> 24:30.292
Nonsense!

24:30.459 --> 24:33.001
As far as I know,
the Chinese eat their dogs.

24:33.167 --> 24:34.792
You don't need a mutt.

24:34.959 --> 24:37.292
You need a new man.

24:37.459 --> 24:39.626
Because you couldn't
hang on to the old one.

24:39.792 --> 24:42.084
Couldn't hang on to him?
Are you serious?

24:42.251 --> 24:44.417
Yes! I liked Oscar.

24:45.084 --> 24:47.167
A lot. I got on very well with him.

24:47.334 --> 24:49.917
And you'd have had lovely kids.

24:50.084 --> 24:52.917
- But you had to drive him off...
- Here you go.

24:54.209 --> 24:56.876
...with your pigheadedness.
Or so he hinted.

24:57.667 --> 25:00.167
- You talked to Oscar?
- But of course.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.667
We still get on very well.

25:02.834 --> 25:05.876
Just because you threw him out
doesn't mean I have to.

25:08.542 --> 25:12.792
Did he also tell you he's now editor,
and he cheated on me?

25:12.959 --> 25:15.084
For god's sake, it happens.

25:15.584 --> 25:17.376
You're my only daughter,

25:17.542 --> 25:21.376
and I want to hold a grandson in my arms
at least once in my life.

25:22.001 --> 25:24.167
Who knows how much time I have left?

25:24.334 --> 25:26.834
Don't mothers usually say something like

25:27.001 --> 25:31.209
"there are other fish in the sea"
or something... supportive?

25:31.376 --> 25:33.001
But not at your age.

25:33.167 --> 25:34.501
But I'm not that old.

25:34.667 --> 25:38.917
Your eggs start to go stale
fast after 30. That's a fact.

25:39.084 --> 25:41.751
At least freeze them. You owe me that.

25:45.876 --> 25:47.667
So this is the little bugger!

25:48.251 --> 25:50.084
MY GRANDSON IS A DOG

25:50.251 --> 25:53.376
- Was that really necessary?
- Why not? I'm proud.

25:54.334 --> 25:56.376
My grandson has four legs.

25:56.542 --> 25:58.459
How many people can say that?

25:59.251 --> 26:01.001
You know your father's humor.

26:01.167 --> 26:04.917
Although I'd like you to take it
a little more seriously.

26:05.084 --> 26:07.917
- Both of you.
- Could we all just stop?

26:08.459 --> 26:11.626
And in case either of you is interested,

26:12.626 --> 26:14.626
I'm doing just fine.

26:16.251 --> 26:18.042
So you've met someone?

26:18.751 --> 26:20.501
What? Yes.

26:21.792 --> 26:23.376
Walking the dog.

26:23.542 --> 26:26.501
You can't believe
the men you meet when you have a dog.

26:26.667 --> 26:28.292
No!

26:28.459 --> 26:30.709
Well, then...

26:32.001 --> 26:33.709
Where is he anyway?

26:35.626 --> 26:36.751
Not again!

26:36.917 --> 26:39.251
- So who's your new friend?
- Bozer!

26:40.209 --> 26:41.834
Why do you keep running away?

26:44.751 --> 26:47.209
- In heat?
- No!

26:48.709 --> 26:51.459
I... meant the dog.

26:52.084 --> 26:53.751
Oh, right.

26:53.917 --> 26:55.376
No, he's male.

26:56.251 --> 26:58.001
So he is.

26:58.167 --> 27:00.126
But the two get along well.

27:00.709 --> 27:01.792
Yeah.

27:04.251 --> 27:05.917
Shall we have a drink?

27:07.584 --> 27:08.584
Yes.

27:10.167 --> 27:13.834
Could we get another red wine?

27:15.209 --> 27:17.209
You did good, Bozer.

27:17.376 --> 27:20.167
Horoscope-wise,
you're my pick-up strategy.

27:20.334 --> 27:21.917
Tonight'll be a blast.

27:25.251 --> 27:28.292
A little something extra for you. Look!

27:34.459 --> 27:37.292
You stay here now, hear?
You stay out here.

27:50.292 --> 27:52.001
- What's this?
- What?

27:52.167 --> 27:53.667
There's something here.

27:54.042 --> 27:55.042
Where?

28:00.667 --> 28:02.459
It's a tick!

28:06.917 --> 28:10.334
Listen, you need watch it closely.

28:10.501 --> 28:13.001
If a red circle develops,
go to the doctor.

28:13.167 --> 28:14.334
He was right.

28:14.501 --> 28:18.001
Where there's one, there's more.
I better keep looking.

28:28.042 --> 28:30.001
Yum, yum.

28:30.167 --> 28:31.584
Really yummy-

28:33.126 --> 28:34.584
Look at that.

28:37.876 --> 28:39.251
Come on.

28:45.626 --> 28:47.251
Oh, no.

28:47.417 --> 28:48.417
No.

28:51.084 --> 28:54.292
I've had enough.
I'm taking you to Happy Dogs.

29:19.251 --> 29:21.251
I know, I know. I'm on it.

29:22.001 --> 29:25.751
I'm just missing the Loibl interview.
But he hasn't called back.

29:25.917 --> 29:27.376
Nature.

29:27.542 --> 29:28.917
That's our next issue.

29:29.209 --> 29:30.542
- Nature?
- Yes.

29:30.709 --> 29:33.959
- But that's not your area.
- It is! Nature!

29:35.001 --> 29:36.251
- Gesundheit.
- Gesundheit.

29:36.417 --> 29:38.417
Our first big focus is the forest.

29:38.584 --> 29:40.459
And I want you to do it.

29:40.626 --> 29:44.334
I studied politics and communication.

29:44.501 --> 29:46.501
What would I do in the forest?

29:46.667 --> 29:48.001
You'll find out.

29:48.167 --> 29:51.584
You research like nobody else.
That's what makes you great.

29:51.751 --> 29:55.126
So take your dog
and let the forest guide you.

29:56.126 --> 29:58.876
Take all the time you need out there.

30:00.417 --> 30:01.417
Superb.

30:02.251 --> 30:04.042
Your dog's going too, right?

30:04.751 --> 30:06.876
Oscar's personal life is interfering.

30:07.042 --> 30:10.167
He wants to get back at me.
He's sending me to the forest.

30:10.334 --> 30:13.459
How nice that Oscar
took my idea on board.

30:13.626 --> 30:16.001
Nature! A wonderful subject.

30:16.167 --> 30:19.667
Everything is connected.
Everything is multi-causal.

30:19.834 --> 30:22.376
It's up to you to make something of it.

30:22.542 --> 30:24.584
Ella! Call your dog off!

30:24.751 --> 30:26.126
He's harmless.

30:28.251 --> 30:30.084
Now call your dogs!

30:33.167 --> 30:35.626
Kenzo, come! You're supposed to come!

30:35.792 --> 30:37.251
Come now!

30:37.417 --> 30:40.584
I said come! What's wrong with you!

30:41.042 --> 30:44.334
Now! I said come!
What's wrong with you?

30:44.501 --> 30:46.709
Don't yell at your dog!

30:46.876 --> 30:48.834
Why are you yelling? I'm not deaf.

30:49.001 --> 30:50.834
Neither's the dog. On the contrary.

30:51.001 --> 30:53.042
But if he doesn't do what I say...

30:53.209 --> 30:56.126
Don't yell at your dogs, people.
They won't come.

30:56.292 --> 30:57.584
You wouldn't either.

30:57.751 --> 31:01.042
- But, Ms. Lehmann, if Gangster...
- You named your dog Gangster?

31:01.209 --> 31:04.209
- Yes. He guards my property.
- Except he doesn't, right?

31:04.376 --> 31:07.959
No, he sits around and goes nuts
over a fly. What's wrong with him?

31:08.126 --> 31:11.751
Collies are herders. Gangster
wants to keep the herd together.

31:11.917 --> 31:14.292
- It's his job.
- What? He has a job now?

31:14.459 --> 31:18.084
Sure. Each breed is different.
You have to pick the right one.

31:18.251 --> 31:21.709
You're not exactly suited
to pole vaulting, either, right?

31:21.876 --> 31:23.376
Look, Elfriede.

31:23.542 --> 31:25.042
Even weirder than me, eh?

31:27.626 --> 31:28.959
Gangster, come here!

31:29.834 --> 31:31.834
Stay. Leave the others alone.

31:32.001 --> 31:33.001
Hey, Gangster.

31:33.084 --> 31:35.876
You disgraced me today.
Why do you do that?

31:36.042 --> 31:37.167
Good boy.

31:38.876 --> 31:40.126
Feel free to join in.

31:41.084 --> 31:42.584
Now stay here.

31:42.751 --> 31:43.917
What's up?

31:44.084 --> 31:46.667
- I just wanted to leave her here.
- Right.

31:47.626 --> 31:49.584
Susi, do you have a flyer?

31:52.167 --> 31:54.292
- Here, it's all in there.
- Thanks.

31:56.876 --> 32:00.542
39 euros?
For a sleepover and a little food?

32:00.709 --> 32:04.167
For that, he could go
to a fancy hotel, the Astoria.

32:05.542 --> 32:09.209
Good food and care aren't cheap.
You don't live off frozen pizza.

32:09.376 --> 32:12.417
Honestly, who's so stupid
to spend that much on a dog?

32:14.292 --> 32:16.251
I don't mean to be nasty.

32:16.417 --> 32:19.584
I just thought maybe
you could do it a little cheaper.

32:19.751 --> 32:23.501
Not for professional and loving care,
which you only get here.

32:24.876 --> 32:26.959
The yelling costs extra, eh?

32:27.126 --> 32:29.126
- It's included.
- Great vibe here.

32:30.459 --> 32:31.959
So I'll go somewhere else.

32:33.001 --> 32:36.626
Hello, I'm Balthasar.
If you find a better place, tell me.

32:36.792 --> 32:38.584
I can't train my dog forever.

32:38.751 --> 32:40.626
Got it, Mr. Ramadan.

32:48.626 --> 32:50.709
- Lukas!
- Think about it.

32:50.876 --> 32:52.917
- Lukas.
- Okay, bye.

32:53.084 --> 32:55.542
Can you make
the car more dog-friendly?

32:55.709 --> 32:57.792
Dog-friendly? Like woof-woof dogs?

32:57.959 --> 32:59.542
So a lot of dogs fit in it.

33:01.584 --> 33:04.876
- So take out the back bench?
- Back bench out, exactly!

33:05.042 --> 33:07.542
Dog-friendlier, so Elfriede likes it.

33:09.084 --> 33:11.167
- And quickly.
- Quickly.

33:11.334 --> 33:13.792
Do you even have any money? Right now?

33:14.959 --> 33:17.626
- Of course I have money.
- Good.

33:38.542 --> 33:40.501
But you stay with me. Understood?

33:42.001 --> 33:44.209
You stay with me. No running away.

33:44.376 --> 33:45.501
No running...

33:46.126 --> 33:47.334
No!

33:51.959 --> 33:52.959
Man.

33:56.626 --> 33:59.167
Hey, you Vagabond. Took a powder again?

34:00.376 --> 34:02.834
Or is your peculiar mistress
around somewhere?

34:05.167 --> 34:06.959
Are you somewhere?

34:07.917 --> 34:08.917
No.

34:09.542 --> 34:11.667
- What are you doing?
- Me?

34:13.376 --> 34:15.958
- I'm doing research.
- On me?

34:16.126 --> 34:18.583
No, not on you.
It's not supposed to be boring.

34:19.333 --> 34:21.876
On the forest. Our next cover story.

34:22.042 --> 34:24.208
Although, is it really a forest?

34:24.376 --> 34:26.126
More a green belt.

34:29.626 --> 34:30.708
Good boy.

34:30.876 --> 34:33.583
You'd get lost crossing this green belt.

34:33.751 --> 34:35.751
I would not.

34:35.917 --> 34:39.417
You've put up so many signs,
it's impossible to get lost.

34:41.417 --> 34:43.001
He's coming this way.

34:44.917 --> 34:45.917
Okay, good.

34:46.083 --> 34:49.542
At the other end of the forest
are a few fallen trees.

34:50.292 --> 34:52.751
- If you make it there...
- Then...?

34:52.917 --> 34:55.458
I'll treat you to a sparkling wine.

34:55.626 --> 34:58.584
- You like that, right?
- Do I look like I do?

34:59.959 --> 35:00.959
Yes.

35:01.084 --> 35:04.084
But you don't look
like you have sparkling wine.

35:05.751 --> 35:07.209
Okay...

35:07.376 --> 35:09.042
see you there.

35:15.376 --> 35:17.167
Which way exactly?

35:17.334 --> 35:19.459
Just read all those signs.

35:19.626 --> 35:21.209
He attacks Max for no reason.

35:21.376 --> 35:23.251
I know he's old, but still.

35:23.417 --> 35:25.042
You attack Max?

35:25.209 --> 35:26.792
I'll pay, of course.

35:26.959 --> 35:29.334
I don't want money, you're my friend.

35:29.501 --> 35:33.084
But if it's like you say,
I can only help if Max is involved.

35:33.626 --> 35:35.959
Max has no time.
Can't it work without him?

35:36.126 --> 35:39.084
No. The problem
is often the person, not the dog.

35:40.876 --> 35:43.917
- So you can't take him now?
- There's no point.

35:44.084 --> 35:45.584
Mommy
- Yes?

35:45.751 --> 35:49.542
- I need to poop.
- The toilets are there. You can go alone.

35:49.709 --> 35:51.459
But I don't want to.

35:52.584 --> 35:54.917
- You need a vacation.
- No.

35:55.084 --> 35:58.001
- I need a friend who'll help me.
- I'm trying.

35:58.167 --> 36:02.001
But you're uptight, so is your family.
It's like with dogs.

36:02.167 --> 36:05.167
With you everything's about dogs.
I am relaxed!

36:06.001 --> 36:07.084
Yeah, right.

36:07.251 --> 36:09.917
Max is awful to leave everything to you.

36:10.084 --> 36:12.667
He's a successful pianist,
he supports the family.

36:12.834 --> 36:15.376
- But you can do things too.
- What...

36:15.542 --> 36:17.834
What's that mean? Of course I can.

36:18.001 --> 36:20.834
But it was a joint decision
between Max and me.

36:21.001 --> 36:23.292
- Max and I love each other.
- So don't complain.

36:23.459 --> 36:24.584
Mommy...

36:26.751 --> 36:28.001
Let's go then.

36:34.834 --> 36:36.792
You hardly see mongoloids anymore.

36:37.417 --> 36:39.042
The insurance pays.

36:40.001 --> 36:43.251
You know, young man,
there's enough nastiness in this world.

36:43.417 --> 36:47.001
So if you're doing well,
why not treat people with respect.

36:47.167 --> 36:49.251
We all deserve that. Even you.

36:50.167 --> 36:51.542
Come on.

36:51.709 --> 36:54.251
Some people just can't handle the truth.

37:01.667 --> 37:03.834
You're lucky I'm not a violent person.

37:15.876 --> 37:16.876
Thirsty?

37:48.292 --> 37:50.376
Quitting time, boss?

37:50.542 --> 37:52.626
- One more hour.
- It's getting dark.

37:53.376 --> 37:54.626
Exactly.

38:11.001 --> 38:12.167
Klaus!

38:13.876 --> 38:15.917
- Did you see a woman?
- No.

38:17.042 --> 38:20.959
But yesterday I saw a 20-point stag.
That was good.

38:22.626 --> 38:24.292
I saw him too.

39:09.001 --> 39:11.001
Hey there, where's your boss?

39:39.417 --> 39:40.417
Shit.

39:49.001 --> 39:51.376
- Who are you?
- Daniel.

39:52.626 --> 39:54.084
What happened?

39:55.042 --> 39:58.042
I'm the ranger. You fell.

39:58.209 --> 39:59.834
The ranger.

40:01.001 --> 40:02.251
It's you.

40:02.417 --> 40:04.167
I can walk.

40:04.709 --> 40:05.709
Right.

40:06.709 --> 40:08.417
I'll turn on the heat.

40:09.584 --> 40:11.584
I thought you could warm me up.

40:12.251 --> 40:13.876
The heat's on full blast.

40:45.417 --> 40:46.417
Smilla...

40:51.709 --> 40:53.042
Smilla?

40:56.459 --> 40:57.459
Smilla.

41:02.792 --> 41:05.334
Hey, are you checking my phone?

41:05.501 --> 41:07.126
Who's Smilla?

41:07.292 --> 41:11.001
- Who's Smilla?
- What? She's from the concert agency.

41:11.167 --> 41:12.959
And you're sleeping with her?

41:13.126 --> 41:15.667
Idiotic. Look.
I wanted to do it with you.

41:15.834 --> 41:17.917
- Are you having an affair?
- No!

41:18.084 --> 41:20.376
- What is this?
- I'd say no too.

41:20.542 --> 41:24.584
And why's everything different
since you were in Malmö with Smilla?

41:24.751 --> 41:27.876
- Including with Simpson?
- So the dog smells infidelity?

41:28.042 --> 41:29.292
- $0 yes!
- What's yes?

41:29.459 --> 41:30.667
- Yes.
- No!

41:30.834 --> 41:34.042
You're working yourself up.
Are you paranoid?

41:34.209 --> 41:36.042
I don't want to hear it.

41:36.209 --> 41:39.042
- Put something on, you look silly.
- What looks silly?

41:39.501 --> 41:41.167
- Does she scratch you?
- What?

41:41.334 --> 41:44.042
- These welts...
- You know how I got them? Simpson.

41:44.417 --> 41:46.084
Simpson... you're crazy.

41:46.251 --> 41:47.917
You are crazy! Stop this.

41:48.084 --> 41:50.709
Ouch! Stupid de Sade.

41:51.876 --> 41:54.292
Stop worrying. Smilla just...

41:55.334 --> 41:56.667
organizes everything.

41:56.834 --> 42:01.501
She organizes it all,
gives us the feeling life can be easy,

42:01.667 --> 42:03.167
and makes us laugh. Basta.

42:03.334 --> 42:05.709
Smilla makes you laugh
and I make you cry?

42:10.917 --> 42:14.251
Can't that goddamn mutt keep quiet?
I can't stand it.

42:14.417 --> 42:15.876
I have no reason to laugh.

42:16.042 --> 42:20.376
I fight and fight and fight
for our son, and you're no help.

42:20.542 --> 42:22.376
You don't accept help.

42:22.542 --> 42:25.709
Eleven therapists in six months,
not one good enough for Nico.

42:25.876 --> 42:28.751
Recorder lessons, horse and
speech therapy, physio, judo...

42:28.917 --> 42:31.501
What's next, gluten-free baking?
You're nuts.

42:31.667 --> 42:33.876
You ask too much of him. And of me.

42:34.042 --> 42:36.167
Somebody called him mongoloid today.

42:36.334 --> 42:38.792
Somebody called him mongoloid today.

42:41.126 --> 42:42.167
Oh...

42:43.042 --> 42:44.209
shit.

42:44.834 --> 42:47.751
Oh, man, you do a great job.

42:48.209 --> 42:50.459
You're an angel. You're Nico's angel.

42:50.626 --> 42:52.626
But I want my angel to laugh again.

42:53.126 --> 42:55.084
I can't. I can't.

42:55.251 --> 42:58.376
Hey, who said "there is no can't"?

42:59.084 --> 43:00.917
Who said that, huh?

43:02.042 --> 43:05.917
Ah, there's the smile
I fell in love with. There it is.

43:06.084 --> 43:08.292
- You're just saying that.
- No, I'm...

43:08.459 --> 43:10.876
No, I mean it!

43:11.042 --> 43:12.584
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

43:14.459 --> 43:17.417
- Then kiss me.
- My beauty.

43:22.376 --> 43:27.834
Max, Silke says you have
to do the dog therapy with Simpson.

43:28.001 --> 43:30.209
- Otherwise she can't help.
- Oh, man.

43:30.376 --> 43:32.751
- What is it?
- You have great timing.

43:32.917 --> 43:35.167
All we talk about is that stupid mutt.

43:35.334 --> 43:38.959
- But Simpson means a lot to Nico.
- You don't get it.

43:39.126 --> 43:42.417
- What don't I get?
- You can't change Nico.

43:42.584 --> 43:44.709
He is the way he is. Dog, schmog.

43:44.876 --> 43:47.917
We played the genetic lottery
and had bad luck.

43:48.084 --> 43:49.084
- Bad luck?
- Yes.

43:49.251 --> 43:51.626
- You call our son bad luck?
- Shit.

43:51.792 --> 43:53.334
You call Nico bad luck!?

43:53.501 --> 43:57.001
That dog bugs me, really!
I want that dog gone. Tomorrow.

43:57.167 --> 44:00.292
No, no, no!
That would be a disaster for Nico.

44:00.459 --> 44:03.334
I can't take it anymore.
It's driving me nuts.

44:03.501 --> 44:04.667
Give me the phone.

44:04.834 --> 44:07.084
- Where is it? Give it here.
- No, I won't.

44:07.251 --> 44:09.251
- Where is it?
- Forget it.

44:53.417 --> 44:54.876
Thanks.

44:57.251 --> 44:59.751
Who had the bright idea
to send you into the forest?

44:59.917 --> 45:02.584
Who had the bright idea
to send you into the forest?

45:02.751 --> 45:04.376
Nobody sent me.

45:05.042 --> 45:06.376
I'm here voluntarily.

45:11.751 --> 45:14.209
Can I pay you back somehow?

45:15.417 --> 45:16.584
Yes.

45:17.459 --> 45:19.251
And I know exactly how.

45:24.501 --> 45:25.792
HOW?

45:25.959 --> 45:27.834
When you write about the forest,

45:28.001 --> 45:29.959
don't write nonsense.

45:36.251 --> 45:37.251
Okay.

45:41.001 --> 45:43.251
But I might need more guidance.

45:45.542 --> 45:47.084
I can do that.

45:47.251 --> 45:50.209
You hardly see the forest
with all the highways.

45:50.376 --> 45:51.376
I understand.

45:54.626 --> 45:58.251
In Sweden in the 19th century,
they passed a law

45:58.417 --> 46:02.542
that for every tree that was cut down,
a new one had to be planted.

46:03.251 --> 46:05.959
We missed that chance here in Germany.

46:06.126 --> 46:10.667
And what one generation misses,
several generations have to make up for.

46:13.626 --> 46:15.709
It's not always just about us.

46:20.751 --> 46:23.209
<i>- The female then...
- Dr. Seligmann...</i>

46:23.376 --> 46:27.209
How's it looking for you? Berta's ready.
She goes into heat tomorrow.

46:27.376 --> 46:29.459
<i>The day's kind of full, but...</i>

46:30.751 --> 46:33.292
<i>I think I can make time.</i>

46:34.667 --> 46:36.584
<i>You won't be disappointed.</i>

46:37.501 --> 46:39.001
<i>He's looking forward to it.</i>

46:41.459 --> 46:43.209
- Dog days, eh?
- Yes.

46:43.376 --> 46:45.751
I always say cuddling weather.

46:45.917 --> 46:48.792
The perfect day to make love.

46:51.042 --> 46:53.709
I'm really happy
Galileo can pass on his genes.

46:54.917 --> 46:58.042
He's a fine dog.
His character is unmatched.

46:58.751 --> 47:02.084
Yeah, but somehow Galileo
could be a little bolder with her.

47:02.251 --> 47:03.959
He's prancing around a lot.

47:04.126 --> 47:05.292
Have patience.

47:06.167 --> 47:08.042
She's also... a little arrogant.

47:09.876 --> 47:11.251
We'll manage.

47:12.251 --> 47:15.251
But he doesn't seem to get
the difference

47:15.417 --> 47:16.834
between front and back.

47:17.001 --> 47:19.209
Is he waiting for instructions?

47:19.376 --> 47:22.001
He's not waiting.
He knows what he's doing.

47:22.167 --> 47:23.834
Galileo is a Casanova.

47:27.251 --> 47:29.501
But she has her butt right at his nose.

47:29.667 --> 47:32.334
- She's totally inciting him.
- Yes.

47:32.501 --> 47:35.167
- Has he ever bred successfully?
- Of course.

47:35.334 --> 47:38.459
You can see it. All the makings
are there. He's under pressure.

47:38.917 --> 47:42.334
Look at those powerful haunches.
Not to mention his...

47:42.501 --> 47:45.834
But what help are the makings
if he can't consummate the act?

47:46.001 --> 47:48.459
My God, it's complicated!

47:51.167 --> 47:53.792
He's falling asleep.
He wants to go home.

47:55.167 --> 47:57.792
No, it's... he feels watched.

47:58.501 --> 48:02.501
Here's a suggestion:
I think we should go inside...

48:09.501 --> 48:10.876
Are you serious?

48:11.042 --> 48:13.376
Of course I am. It's the car you wanted.

48:13.542 --> 48:16.834
A chill out zone for dogs in the back.
And it's registered.

48:17.001 --> 48:19.251
Trust me, nobody's got one like it.

48:19.417 --> 48:21.959
Not even Snoop Doggy Dog... Snoop Dog.

48:31.251 --> 48:32.292
Right...

48:32.459 --> 48:36.501
Guess where we're going? Zehlendorf,
where the rich assholes live.

48:42.292 --> 48:44.126
Don't panic, I've got a bag.

48:44.792 --> 48:46.917
Upsy, Elfriede! Come on!

49:11.501 --> 49:13.792
If you need anything, call me.

49:40.709 --> 49:42.876
Daddy's going to say goodbye now.

49:43.042 --> 49:45.042
Here, you have my little peanuts.

49:45.209 --> 49:47.584
Oh, you probably need
a few peanuts too, eh?

49:49.209 --> 49:51.667
- Take care.
- Thank you! Ciao.

49:57.709 --> 49:59.917
- Thanks! Take your time.
- Thanks.

50:04.209 --> 50:05.459
Elfriede!

50:05.626 --> 50:07.376
That's enough.

50:08.709 --> 50:12.626
Ludwig's the boss today. The
customer is king, you know the rules.

50:45.167 --> 50:47.209
Look, nobody home. Come!

50:51.917 --> 50:54.042
- Good day.
- Top of the day to you.

50:54.209 --> 50:56.792
I'm Oli Simon.
They call me the dog whisperer.

50:56.959 --> 50:58.959
This is my colleague, Elfriede.

51:00.292 --> 51:01.917
Say hello.

51:02.084 --> 51:03.751
Is this a bad time?

51:03.917 --> 51:05.001
No, no problem.

51:05.167 --> 51:07.751
We're young, dynamic, and full of drive.

51:07.917 --> 51:10.959
We walk your dog,
take it swimming, feed it well.

51:11.126 --> 51:14.084
- Your dog is in the best of hands with us.
- That's very nice.

51:14.251 --> 51:15.751
How do you know I have a dog?

51:15.917 --> 51:19.584
Dogs... send out signals,
and I have the antennae.

51:20.376 --> 51:23.959
- So you can influence dogs?
- I can also influence dogs.

51:24.417 --> 51:28.001
- Even when they're aggressive?
- Even when they're aggressive.

51:31.001 --> 51:32.876
- That's him?
- Yes, Simpson.

51:35.459 --> 51:37.834
That's him. That's Simpson, yeah.

51:38.292 --> 51:39.626
Dog whisperer. Simpson.

51:39.792 --> 51:44.959
It'll take some time, of course.
And time is... money.

51:45.501 --> 51:49.667
- So you board them too?
- Of course we board them too.

51:50.584 --> 51:53.042
It's important at every stage of life...

51:53.209 --> 51:55.834
A change of scene is always good.

51:56.001 --> 51:57.042
Right.

51:57.209 --> 51:58.209
Right, sure!

52:01.542 --> 52:05.209
- Is this your car?
- Yes. I'll be right with you.

52:06.209 --> 52:07.209
My sweetheart...

52:07.834 --> 52:10.959
Five hundred? Would that be enough?

52:11.126 --> 52:12.126
Yeah.

52:12.292 --> 52:13.834
That's enough.

52:14.876 --> 52:16.751
Let's swap, here's a flyer.

52:16.917 --> 52:18.001
Call any time.

52:18.917 --> 52:21.251
- I'll just say goodbye.
- Of course.

52:21.876 --> 52:23.251
Take your time.

52:23.417 --> 52:26.959
Simpson,
a little vacation, okay?

52:32.376 --> 52:33.584
So cute!

52:33.751 --> 52:35.209
Who's this?

52:35.667 --> 52:36.667
Him?

52:36.834 --> 52:37.917
This is Bozer.

52:39.167 --> 52:41.792
- I have a sweetie, too.
- Yeah? What's his name?

52:41.959 --> 52:45.167
Puck, like in Midsummer Dream,
creating bedlam.

52:45.334 --> 52:46.667
- Puck?
- Exactly.

52:46.834 --> 52:49.917
- Sweet.
- We could walk them together.

52:51.626 --> 52:53.626
- I'm going to be around a lot.
- Yeah?

52:53.792 --> 52:55.751
Yeah. Ciao.

52:55.917 --> 52:57.334
Okay, bye.

53:04.626 --> 53:06.251
"Around a lot."

53:16.251 --> 53:19.501
Where's my Loibl article?
It was slated for page 4 and 5.

53:19.667 --> 53:21.292
I'm on a call. Ask Oscar.

53:27.001 --> 53:28.417
How is she nature?

53:29.042 --> 53:31.042
Jealousy doesn't become you.

53:33.792 --> 53:35.167
That's her?

53:36.667 --> 53:38.917
- She's the one you can talk to?
- Ella...

53:39.084 --> 53:40.834
Nope, don't Ella me.

53:41.001 --> 53:44.126
Your brain's in your pants,
so you banish me to the woods,

53:44.292 --> 53:47.376
so you can write thrilling portraits
of a thrilling actress,

53:47.542 --> 53:51.209
who isn't boring or dominant.
I hope you're thrilling enough for her.

53:51.376 --> 53:55.334
Don't mix it all up.
You're so perceptive otherwise.

53:55.501 --> 53:57.667
Your interview wasn't strong enough.

53:58.084 --> 54:01.167
- You mean not thrilling enough?
- It wasn't your fault.

54:01.334 --> 54:03.584
An interview is only as good
as the interviewee.

54:03.751 --> 54:06.626
And it was a little thin. And too long.

54:07.542 --> 54:09.959
That's not me talking. Harald said it.

54:12.042 --> 54:14.501
And we definitely want to do the forest,

54:14.667 --> 54:16.667
depending on what you come up with.

54:17.251 --> 54:20.417
- What are you trying to say?
- That you need to deliver.

54:21.292 --> 54:23.292
I will. And it won't be bullshit.

54:23.459 --> 54:28.251
Go to it. Quality will win the day.
I'm totally professional that way.

54:29.667 --> 54:31.834
One more thing...

54:32.001 --> 54:33.876
Next time you come in,

54:34.042 --> 54:35.709
leave the dog at home.

54:36.126 --> 54:38.667
Caspar has an allergy and a phobia.

54:38.834 --> 54:40.417
He has to work from home now.

54:40.584 --> 54:42.084
Plus he stinks. The dog.

54:43.876 --> 54:46.084
I'm responsible for everyone here.

54:46.251 --> 54:48.126
So how does that work?

54:48.292 --> 54:49.792
Where should I leave Bozer?

54:49.959 --> 54:52.501
Not my problem.
You should have thought of that.

55:08.751 --> 55:11.792
- Where are all the dogs?
- They all canceled.

55:11.959 --> 55:14.626
- What?
- There's competition in town.

55:14.792 --> 55:17.459
- But that's not the only thing.
- What do you mean?

55:17.626 --> 55:20.917
I mean...
you're always spoiling for a fight.

55:21.584 --> 55:24.376
The people need to feel good too.
Not just the dogs.

55:24.876 --> 55:27.584
Maybe so,
but where have the dogs gone?

55:34.251 --> 55:35.834
I don't know either.

55:38.084 --> 55:39.626
Out of there!

55:43.626 --> 55:44.667
Listen up!

55:44.834 --> 55:47.959
In two hours,
you can all go home, except Simpson.

55:48.126 --> 55:49.626
What're you doing there?

55:49.792 --> 55:51.417
Everybody stop!

55:51.584 --> 55:56.001
No fighting, no farting around,
or pissing in the corner.

55:57.334 --> 56:01.126
Everybody together!
Pull yourselves together and... sit!

56:11.376 --> 56:12.959
See, you can do it.

56:18.501 --> 56:20.084
Oli, old man.

56:20.251 --> 56:21.959
Hey, my sweet mouse.

56:22.126 --> 56:24.417
Is that your jalopy downstairs?
Ridiculous.

56:24.584 --> 56:26.417
Bet it cost a pretty penny, huh?

56:26.584 --> 56:30.292
Don't forget, dogs need exercise,
not the TV, you genius!

56:30.834 --> 56:32.251
Didn't we say three days?

56:32.417 --> 56:34.376
The boss wants a little today.

56:34.542 --> 56:36.459
You know, good will.

56:39.167 --> 56:40.834
Stop, sweetheart, I said!

56:41.001 --> 56:42.917
- Keep him back.
- Yeah, calm down.

56:48.334 --> 56:49.876
Petty cash, baby.

56:50.042 --> 56:51.751
That'll never buy you out.

56:51.917 --> 56:53.751
You're an asshole. Now get out.

56:54.417 --> 56:57.959
If we didn't have a problem
with each other, we'd fuck for sure.

56:59.376 --> 57:01.251
Come, darling, come!

57:07.876 --> 57:10.792
So Simpson,
you want to play soccer?

57:13.751 --> 57:16.209
Simpson will be back soon, I promise.

57:16.376 --> 57:18.084
You're dumb, Daddy.

57:18.251 --> 57:21.001
He's just... on a short trip.

57:21.917 --> 57:23.167
He was really happy.

57:23.334 --> 57:25.251
He's in Switzerland, visiting friends.

57:25.417 --> 57:27.959
In Bern, where all
Swiss cattle dogs come from.

57:28.126 --> 57:31.959
Every year, they celebrate
the big Bernese cattle dog festival.

57:32.126 --> 57:36.209
With relatives, friends, grandma,
grandpa. They're all there.

57:36.792 --> 57:39.917
He... flew there, in a plane.

57:40.084 --> 57:42.209
Dogs can't fly.

57:42.376 --> 57:43.584
You are lying.

58:06.209 --> 58:09.251
- I'll make you guys a milkshake.
- I don't want one.

58:20.751 --> 58:22.376
Look closely.

58:22.917 --> 58:25.751
- Use your imagination and you'll see it.
- What?

58:25.917 --> 58:30.667
A handful of forest floor has more living
creatures than there are people on Earth.

58:30.834 --> 58:31.959
Microbes.

58:32.126 --> 58:36.251
- But it's dead. You can see it.
- No, the tree cadaver is alive.

58:36.417 --> 58:39.501
Sorry, but cadaver and life
is an oxymoron.

58:40.292 --> 58:42.126
- What?
- A contradiction.

58:42.292 --> 58:46.251
- I see a dead tree and yucky mushrooms.
- The dead tree has many functions.

58:46.751 --> 58:50.876
And the web of mushrooms
stretches across the whole forest floor.

58:51.959 --> 58:54.709
It's sort of the Internet of the woods.

58:55.667 --> 58:59.209
And the NSA is here too?
Or why are you whispering?

58:59.376 --> 59:00.709
I don't know.

59:04.626 --> 59:08.126
In the winter cold, they come
out of more than 2,000 chambers,

59:08.292 --> 59:11.584
to warm up in the sun.
Then go down and emit the heat.

59:11.751 --> 59:14.376
Like solar collectors.
That's why ants are dark.

59:15.626 --> 59:19.042
Every single ant has its own job.

59:19.876 --> 59:23.042
No chance for a promotion,
no career, no ego shit.

59:32.626 --> 59:33.834
Bozer, come here!

59:38.167 --> 59:39.501
Bozer, stay.

59:53.542 --> 59:55.792
Careful, look for cars.

59:56.501 --> 59:58.001
None coming.

01:00:03.584 --> 01:00:05.251
It's right up here.

01:00:05.417 --> 01:00:07.251
So, boys and girls, soccer time.

01:00:07.417 --> 01:00:11.292
This is the ball. Black and yellow,
like Borussia Dortmund.

01:00:11.459 --> 01:00:14.126
I want to see
Champions League level, got it?

01:00:14.751 --> 01:00:16.334
Right, over to the middle.

01:00:16.501 --> 01:00:18.251
Let's kick off. Here it is.

01:00:19.001 --> 01:00:20.792
Here it is. Exactly!

01:00:24.209 --> 01:00:26.417
The goal's over there!
I'll show you.

01:00:26.584 --> 01:00:29.001
Into the goal. That's it, perfect! 1-0.

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:30.501
And go!

01:00:33.917 --> 01:00:35.834
Foul! You can't do that!

01:00:42.251 --> 01:00:43.751
Corner kick!

01:00:43.917 --> 01:00:46.251
Go get it, go get it!

01:00:46.917 --> 01:00:48.376
Keep going, keep going!

01:00:48.542 --> 01:00:50.292
Simpson, you have to go for it.

01:00:54.834 --> 01:00:56.001
You need to pass.

01:01:00.251 --> 01:01:02.084
Come on! Yeess!

01:01:02.251 --> 01:01:04.167
That's how it's done.

01:01:16.751 --> 01:01:18.251
Hey, Oli.

01:01:25.917 --> 01:01:27.251
Hey.

01:01:27.417 --> 01:01:28.542
Hey.

01:01:28.709 --> 01:01:31.001
So you're a real entrepreneur now.

01:01:31.167 --> 01:01:32.917
I told you so.

01:01:33.834 --> 01:01:36.167
Everything you do turns into fun.

01:01:38.834 --> 01:01:40.459
Sometimes I miss that.

01:01:44.709 --> 01:01:48.084
Maybe it's because
you only hang out with boring people.

01:01:48.251 --> 01:01:50.001
Like Mickels.

01:01:50.501 --> 01:01:52.542
- But he's in perfect shape.
- What?

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:54.209
Perfect shape.

01:01:58.626 --> 01:02:01.042
You too. You know that.

01:02:02.501 --> 01:02:04.501
Are they going to play a real match?

01:02:05.417 --> 01:02:07.042
Yes.

01:02:07.584 --> 01:02:09.751
- Saturday is a league game.
- League game?

01:02:10.376 --> 01:02:12.501
You're welcome to come, at 2 p.m..

01:02:12.667 --> 01:02:14.001
We will.

01:02:36.417 --> 01:02:37.417
Swimming.

01:02:40.292 --> 01:02:41.709
If it's warm.

01:02:58.917 --> 01:03:00.417
Yeah.

01:03:00.584 --> 01:03:02.084
When it's warmer.

01:03:04.251 --> 01:03:05.251
Yeah.

01:03:18.126 --> 01:03:19.667
What are these bells for?

01:03:20.792 --> 01:03:22.876
This is a natural burial site.

01:03:24.709 --> 01:03:26.584
Natural burial.

01:03:29.709 --> 01:03:31.542
A cemetery in the forest.

01:03:33.459 --> 01:03:35.751
Everyone dies.
But first you have to live.

01:03:48.167 --> 01:03:50.251
You're really not my type.

01:04:09.542 --> 01:04:10.876
Look how yummy.

01:04:12.042 --> 01:04:13.917
Yummy. Go on.

01:04:15.209 --> 01:04:17.001
Elfriede, you have to eat.

01:04:18.751 --> 01:04:21.417
It's yummy, really yummy.

01:04:24.917 --> 01:04:27.376
Simpson, you have food.
There's water.

01:04:28.626 --> 01:04:30.251
And some entertainment.

01:04:30.709 --> 01:04:32.751
I have to take care of Elfriede.

01:04:40.584 --> 01:04:42.251
- I need to go in.
- Not now.

01:04:42.417 --> 01:04:45.876
- It's life and death.
- Don't exaggerate. You look healthy.

01:04:46.042 --> 01:04:48.334
And Mrs. Klein will be too. But not now.

01:04:48.834 --> 01:04:50.292
Her dog won't eat.

01:04:51.417 --> 01:04:55.251
Final word. Nobody wakes Mrs. Klein up,
besides the dear lord!

01:04:55.417 --> 01:04:58.709
Yesterday was a little...
too much.

01:04:59.292 --> 01:05:01.292
- Too much what?
- Stress.

01:05:01.459 --> 01:05:03.626
Stress. In there?

01:05:03.792 --> 01:05:07.084
She had a visitor. Unauthorized.
Alcohol was involved.

01:05:07.251 --> 01:05:09.959
We've told her many times,
but she won't listen.

01:05:10.834 --> 01:05:12.084
What's in there?

01:05:14.126 --> 01:05:15.501
Thank you.

01:05:28.542 --> 01:05:30.459
- Anybody there?
- No.

01:05:33.376 --> 01:05:34.584
I can see you.

01:05:35.292 --> 01:05:37.209
We're closed today.

01:05:37.376 --> 01:05:39.251
I need your advice.

01:05:39.792 --> 01:05:42.501
About a cheap place to leave your dog?

01:05:42.667 --> 01:05:44.667
Here, once I've had to cut my prices.

01:05:44.834 --> 01:05:49.251
No, that's not the problem.
Elfriede hasn't eaten in days.

01:05:49.417 --> 01:05:52.834
I'm starting to worry
that something's wrong.

01:05:53.709 --> 01:05:55.376
Steak to start.

01:05:56.542 --> 01:06:00.917
And salmon-flavored doggie
ice-cream for dessert. Look at that!

01:06:03.876 --> 01:06:06.501
Elfriede, so you're not depressed.

01:06:06.667 --> 01:06:08.459
Nonsense. She's not depressed.

01:06:08.626 --> 01:06:10.709
She's just completely spoiled.

01:06:10.876 --> 01:06:13.084
You're the depressed one.

01:06:19.542 --> 01:06:21.584
Could I get a steak too?

01:06:48.167 --> 01:06:50.251
Now I'll be able to sleep tonight.

01:06:51.334 --> 01:06:52.959
It's just so healthy.

01:06:54.417 --> 01:06:56.251
Almost time for the second half.

01:06:56.959 --> 01:07:00.167
- What do you mean half?
- There's always a second half.

01:07:01.167 --> 01:07:03.417
You're a soccer player?

01:07:03.584 --> 01:07:05.167
Ex soccer player.

01:07:07.501 --> 01:07:11.834
- Then there has to be a second half.
- Yep. Sometimes even a third.

01:07:22.042 --> 01:07:25.751
WHY THE FOREST DOESN'T NEED AN I-PHONE

01:07:25.917 --> 01:07:28.959
OR
NATURE DOESN'T CALL BACK

01:07:52.209 --> 01:07:54.084
Daniel, Daniel, look!

01:07:59.126 --> 01:08:01.417
- There are way too many of them.
- What?

01:08:01.584 --> 01:08:03.709
Why? They're so cute.

01:08:05.251 --> 01:08:08.042
- Guess I'm just into baby stuff right now.
- Yeah...

01:08:08.834 --> 01:08:11.626
- Don't you like children?
- Sure.

01:08:36.001 --> 01:08:38.042
- Lulu!
- Cecile?

01:08:40.292 --> 01:08:43.167
What are you doing here?
Not your kind of restaurant.

01:08:43.334 --> 01:08:44.709
- I have a date.
- Really?

01:08:44.876 --> 01:08:47.292
Yes, right now
and it's going to go well.

01:08:48.501 --> 01:08:50.709
- So clear out.
- Yeah.

01:08:51.376 --> 01:08:53.667
And... don't stare the whole time.

01:08:55.667 --> 01:08:57.459
My lips are sealed.

01:09:04.001 --> 01:09:05.876
Your table.

01:09:06.042 --> 01:09:08.376
I forgot to take off my coat.

01:09:10.334 --> 01:09:12.459
- Could you give me a hand?
- Yes.

01:09:18.542 --> 01:09:20.751
- Take good care of the belt.
- Yes.

01:09:23.251 --> 01:09:26.792
Right. This is the beverage menu.
May I get you something?

01:09:26.959 --> 01:09:29.376
- Yes, two vodkas, please.
- As an aperitif?

01:09:30.042 --> 01:09:32.376
- Yes, if you have it.
- Yes, vodka.

01:09:32.542 --> 01:09:33.834
- Okay, right?
- Of course.

01:09:34.001 --> 01:09:36.001
- As an accelerator.
- Of course.

01:09:38.876 --> 01:09:40.251
Hey...

01:09:40.417 --> 01:09:44.834
Cécile, we should do this more often,
get out of our daily routine.

01:09:45.459 --> 01:09:48.084
Just the two of us. Time for us.

01:09:48.251 --> 01:09:50.251
It's like a date.

01:09:51.626 --> 01:09:53.542
Otherwise, it all just gets to us.

01:09:54.501 --> 01:09:55.959
Hello?

01:09:56.126 --> 01:09:57.709
You can say that again.

01:09:58.084 --> 01:09:59.209
What is it?

01:10:00.209 --> 01:10:01.709
I hope somebody shows up.

01:10:02.501 --> 01:10:07.959
So, vodka for the lady,
and one for the gentleman.

01:10:08.126 --> 01:10:09.959
- Thank you. Na zdarovje!
- Hup!

01:10:10.126 --> 01:10:11.792
- To you!
- Hup.

01:10:17.042 --> 01:10:18.751
Finally, we meet.

01:10:18.917 --> 01:10:20.126
You said "hup"?

01:10:21.959 --> 01:10:23.001
- Hello.
- Lovely.

01:10:25.834 --> 01:10:27.334
It's moving along.

01:10:27.501 --> 01:10:30.042
I finally managed to make time
so we could meet.

01:10:30.751 --> 01:10:32.251
Really?

01:10:32.417 --> 01:10:35.334
You're much prettier
than in your photos.

01:10:37.417 --> 01:10:41.126
What a charmer, Dr. Professor Seligmann.

01:10:42.126 --> 01:10:45.584
<i>Dr. Professor. Just ca“ me Se“.</i>

01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:49.084
Seli and Lulu.

01:10:49.251 --> 01:10:51.001
I like that.

01:10:58.001 --> 01:11:00.709
- May I kiss you?
- Don't ask, just do!

01:11:21.501 --> 01:11:23.084
We're thinking the same thing.

01:11:25.542 --> 01:11:26.876
- Hey...
- Could we...

01:11:27.917 --> 01:11:29.459
have two more, please.

01:11:31.251 --> 01:11:33.792
- I get so loud when I drink.
- I like it.

01:11:34.834 --> 01:11:35.834
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:11:35.917 --> 01:11:38.334
Unfortunately, no dogs are allowed here,

01:11:38.501 --> 01:11:41.084
or I would have brought Galileo
to meet you.

01:11:41.251 --> 01:11:43.001
- You have a dog?
- Yes, Galileo.

01:11:43.167 --> 01:11:47.084
- But that isn't in your profile.
- I wanted to tell you in person.

01:11:47.251 --> 01:11:49.542
- Don't you like dogs?
- I have cats.

01:11:51.292 --> 01:11:52.501
You didn't mention that.

01:11:52.667 --> 01:11:57.167
Because guys always think
a woman with cats is eccentric.

01:11:57.709 --> 01:11:59.376
Round two.

01:11:59.917 --> 01:12:01.626
Here you go.

01:12:03.167 --> 01:12:04.167
Thank you.

01:12:05.042 --> 01:12:06.834
- Hup!
- Na zdarovje.

01:12:07.542 --> 01:12:10.126
- Cats are so arrogant.
- Wonderful creatures.

01:12:10.292 --> 01:12:13.251
- Have you made your choice?
- In a minute!

01:12:13.417 --> 01:12:15.084
This can't be happening.

01:12:15.626 --> 01:12:19.834
For 35,000 years,
humans and dogs have lived together.

01:12:20.001 --> 01:12:21.501
Dogs try to understand you.

01:12:21.667 --> 01:12:25.042
A cat meows and ignores you,
it doesn't understand anything.

01:12:25.209 --> 01:12:28.542
Cats... don't just follow orders.

01:12:28.709 --> 01:12:30.751
They love freedom and independence.

01:12:30.917 --> 01:12:33.084
A dog's brain is three times the size.

01:12:33.251 --> 01:12:36.334
- Here we go again!
- 64 cubic centimeters vs. 25.

01:12:36.501 --> 01:12:38.001
Men and size!

01:12:38.167 --> 01:12:40.334
- Cheers!
- Na zdarovje!

01:12:40.501 --> 01:12:41.667
A dog wakes you in a fire.

01:12:41.834 --> 01:12:44.917
While a cat creeps out
the back door and lets you burn.

01:12:45.084 --> 01:12:47.751
That's an evil allegation!
Cats are wonderful.

01:12:48.376 --> 01:12:49.917
Ask the ancient Egyptians.

01:12:50.084 --> 01:12:54.042
And there's no more lovely,
sexier sound in the world

01:12:54.209 --> 01:12:56.584
than the purr of a happy cat.

01:12:56.751 --> 01:12:58.626
But dogs are more intelligent.

01:12:59.501 --> 01:13:02.209
And I think that's true
of their owners, too.

01:13:02.376 --> 01:13:04.417
So, ready to order now?

01:13:05.584 --> 01:13:07.667
I've lost my appetite.

01:13:09.751 --> 01:13:11.584
And that's no mean feat.

01:13:16.542 --> 01:13:19.042
- Are they leaving already?
- Off... to bed.

01:13:20.959 --> 01:13:22.709
They didn't eat.

01:13:23.292 --> 01:13:26.084
- Shall we do the same?
- I need to eat first.

01:13:26.959 --> 01:13:28.292
Sure.

01:13:33.459 --> 01:13:35.834
I shouldn't have drunk so much.

01:13:36.001 --> 01:13:37.251
Relax.

01:13:37.417 --> 01:13:42.209
Nico won't think you're dumb for being
hungover and in a bad mood for a change.

01:13:42.376 --> 01:13:44.292
- Oh, shut up!
- See?

01:13:44.792 --> 01:13:47.834
- What?
- Where's your sense of humor?

01:13:48.584 --> 01:13:51.084
- Where's my belt?
- How should I know?

01:14:04.084 --> 01:14:05.251
Nico!

01:14:09.042 --> 01:14:11.209
Hey, why aren't you in bed?

01:14:12.751 --> 01:14:15.251
I want my Simpson, my Simpson!

01:14:19.334 --> 01:14:22.167
Then I'll go to a hotel for a few days,

01:14:24.292 --> 01:14:26.917
- and you'll get your Simpson back.
- Yeah!

01:14:27.084 --> 01:14:31.001
- Can I go now?
- Sure, of course.

01:14:31.584 --> 01:14:35.292
Max, forget this nonsense.
I thought you were joking.

01:14:35.876 --> 01:14:37.876
I'll be in a hotel. You can get the dog.

01:14:38.042 --> 01:14:39.834
Max, please.

01:14:40.001 --> 01:14:44.501
I can't prepare for the concert like this.
You think I just do it off the cuff?

01:14:45.167 --> 01:14:47.417
That idiocy with Smilla.

01:14:48.251 --> 01:14:50.376
When you checked my cell,
I was innocent.

01:14:50.542 --> 01:14:54.251
But the other day...
I almost kissed her.

01:14:54.417 --> 01:14:58.626
Something's wrong with me.
With Nico, with you, with all of us.

01:14:59.292 --> 01:15:01.709
And it's all my fault, because...

01:15:01.876 --> 01:15:04.126
I wanted another child, and you didn't.

01:15:04.292 --> 01:15:06.251
And don't say that isn't true.

01:15:07.834 --> 01:15:09.084
I have to go.

01:15:10.459 --> 01:15:12.459
I have to prepare. I'm sorry.

01:15:30.417 --> 01:15:35.292
- This bottle's on you, Oli, you're paying.
- I know. That's my money, after all.

01:15:36.542 --> 01:15:39.292
- Raise. Five hundred.
- I fold.

01:15:39.876 --> 01:15:42.542
You should too, Oli.
You never know when to stop.

01:15:42.709 --> 01:15:45.042
You don't know what I've got.

01:15:47.417 --> 01:15:48.459
Four hundred.

01:15:50.834 --> 01:15:52.334
And my watch.

01:16:03.709 --> 01:16:07.501
Man, Oli, you play poker
as badly as you did soccer.

01:16:14.084 --> 01:16:16.917
Give me back
my fucking money, motherfucker!

01:16:17.084 --> 01:16:19.959
And my watch! I want my watch!

01:16:20.126 --> 01:16:22.001
And you, damn faggot, not a word!

01:16:22.167 --> 01:16:23.459
Oli, are you nuts?

01:16:34.501 --> 01:16:35.751
Hey...

01:16:35.917 --> 01:16:39.834
I thought I'd leave Bozer here
during the day. He likes it so much.

01:16:40.001 --> 01:16:43.709
And I'd come back after work
and we'd go swimming in the lake.

01:16:43.876 --> 01:16:45.501
I could get used to that.

01:16:53.959 --> 01:16:55.584
Right. Time to work!

01:16:57.376 --> 01:17:00.459
Let's Thanks, boss.

01:17:01.917 --> 01:17:03.751
Off to the blind, yeah?

01:17:03.917 --> 01:17:05.792
- Have fun!
- Bye.

01:17:05.959 --> 01:17:07.751
- I'll bring you coffee and tea.
- Thanks.

01:17:08.417 --> 01:17:09.417
Hey...

01:17:11.209 --> 01:17:13.001
I could get used to it too.

01:17:13.876 --> 01:17:16.334
- But I have to tell you something.
- What?

01:17:17.084 --> 01:17:18.876
You think I'm dominant?

01:17:19.042 --> 01:17:21.334
Maybe a little,
but it doesn't bother me.

01:17:21.501 --> 01:17:22.626
Boring?
<i>'</i> No!

01:17:22.792 --> 01:17:24.251
So, what?

01:17:26.626 --> 01:17:31.209
We could sleep together a hundred times,
but nothing would happen.

01:17:31.626 --> 01:17:35.334
I didn't get that impression
when we were in the forest.

01:17:36.542 --> 01:17:38.334
I don't mean that.

01:17:39.917 --> 01:17:41.126
What do you mean?

01:17:41.292 --> 01:17:43.084
I can't give you children.

01:17:46.876 --> 01:17:50.459
- But there must be something you can do?
- It's genetic.

01:18:01.042 --> 01:18:02.542
I'm sorry.

01:18:12.001 --> 01:18:14.501
Okay, I'll take you to your car.

01:18:54.292 --> 01:18:56.084
I'm not in the mood, Bozer.

01:18:58.084 --> 01:18:59.292
Go away.

01:19:01.209 --> 01:19:03.417
Let me just be sad.

01:19:08.459 --> 01:19:09.751
I don't need that.

01:19:09.917 --> 01:19:13.126
Yeah, you can chew it.
Just do a good job.

01:19:26.542 --> 01:19:27.751
Wait here, Bozer.

01:19:27.917 --> 01:19:30.584
There are cats up there,
it'd be a disaster.

01:19:30.751 --> 01:19:32.126
I'll leave the radio on.

01:19:35.667 --> 01:19:37.209
Back soon!

01:19:44.751 --> 01:19:47.584
- But who the hell is Kiera Kowalski?
- No idea.

01:19:47.751 --> 01:19:50.459
Some kind of actress. An ensemble star.

01:19:51.209 --> 01:19:52.917
And the ranger? Any update?

01:19:53.084 --> 01:19:55.542
Don't know. She hasn't said anything.

01:19:55.709 --> 01:19:57.584
But it doesn't matter.

01:19:57.751 --> 01:20:00.751
Whether you have a man or not,
you always end up alone.

01:20:02.709 --> 01:20:04.917
You always end up alone.

01:20:11.334 --> 01:20:12.667
Hey, Ella.

01:20:12.834 --> 01:20:14.459
- Want a martini?
- Sit down.

01:20:14.626 --> 01:20:16.626
- Yeah, come sit.
- Let's have a drink.

01:20:16.792 --> 01:20:18.709
And there's chocolate.

01:20:19.209 --> 01:20:21.126
- So, Ella...
- We're up to C.

01:20:21.292 --> 01:20:22.626
- To C!
- Cheers!

01:20:24.876 --> 01:20:27.167
So when do we meet your ranger?

01:20:28.334 --> 01:20:30.251
- You don't.
- Is he that sexy?

01:20:33.501 --> 01:20:35.667
Okay, sorry, sorry. What's wrong?

01:20:35.834 --> 01:20:37.376
You're crying.

01:20:38.876 --> 01:20:41.626
He can screw everybody,
and nothing will happen.

01:20:42.209 --> 01:20:43.584
Okay.

01:20:43.751 --> 01:20:47.459
I mean, something happens.
But... he can't father children.

01:20:49.084 --> 01:20:50.709
That's our era's sperm.

01:20:50.876 --> 01:20:53.751
They keep getting fewer,
slower, and more useless.

01:20:53.917 --> 01:20:56.126
It's got up sides and down sides.

01:20:56.292 --> 01:20:58.584
What kind of up sides?

01:20:58.751 --> 01:21:01.917
I think I'm in love with him.
I wanted his children.

01:21:02.084 --> 01:21:04.167
Yeah, but at least you fell in love.

01:21:04.334 --> 01:21:06.292
I just had a total disaster date.

01:21:06.459 --> 01:21:08.251
- He kept...
- And I butted in too.

01:21:08.417 --> 01:21:11.292
It wasn't you.
All he talked about was his dog.

01:21:12.126 --> 01:21:14.292
- Its name is Galileo!
- Galileo?

01:21:14.459 --> 01:21:18.042
Hey... Professor Dr. Seligmann.

01:21:18.209 --> 01:21:21.084
- This guy? Him?
- You know him? Don't tell me you...

01:21:21.251 --> 01:21:22.709
He tried to flirt with me

01:21:22.876 --> 01:21:25.834
while his Galileo
failed to copulate with Berta.

01:21:26.001 --> 01:21:28.001
Last week, he pulled ticks off me.

01:21:28.167 --> 01:21:29.751
- What?
- He collected ticks.

01:21:29.917 --> 01:21:31.459
- Seriously?
- Nothing else.

01:21:31.626 --> 01:21:34.709
Lulu, be happy he didn't get far,
that you have cats.

01:21:34.876 --> 01:21:36.876
- I want a man too.
- It doesn't matter.

01:21:37.042 --> 01:21:38.292
You always end up alone.

01:21:38.459 --> 01:21:40.501
- You're being dramatic.
- She's not.

01:21:40.667 --> 01:21:42.251
I'm alone too.

01:21:42.417 --> 01:21:44.667
I'd like to be loved too.

01:21:45.376 --> 01:21:47.209
Max...

01:21:49.834 --> 01:21:52.084
moved into a hotel.

01:21:58.792 --> 01:22:00.792
But you were so in love.

01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:04.001
Not now.

01:22:04.167 --> 01:22:06.834
He's in a hotel,
and I'm picking up Simpson tomorrow.

01:22:07.334 --> 01:22:09.376
- Where is he?
- With a dog whisperer.

01:22:09.542 --> 01:22:11.251
Why didn't you bring him to me?

01:22:11.417 --> 01:22:14.459
You made it so complicated.
He turned up on my doorstep.

01:22:14.626 --> 01:22:17.751
- He was open, cheerful, outgoing, and...
- Great!

01:22:18.209 --> 01:22:20.459
- Here's his flyer.
- Can't wait.

01:22:20.959 --> 01:22:22.501
Let's see it.

01:22:24.834 --> 01:22:26.376
Oli Simon.

01:22:26.542 --> 01:22:29.209
He's no dog whisperer,
he's an ex soccer player.

01:22:29.376 --> 01:22:32.376
- Don't tell me you...
- Sorry, but he came to a course.

01:22:33.584 --> 01:22:35.417
Ah, and he learned from you?

01:22:35.584 --> 01:22:37.751
Yeah, he... call it whatever you like.

01:22:37.917 --> 01:22:40.084
Oli Simon, he was that sub at Hertha.

01:22:40.251 --> 01:22:44.376
- Damn hustler stole all my customers.
- And you and him...

01:22:44.542 --> 01:22:47.626
Now it all makes sense.
Tomorrow's a doggie soccer game.

01:22:47.792 --> 01:22:48.834
What?

01:22:49.126 --> 01:22:52.167
- What?
- Yeah. Simpson's playing in it.

01:22:52.584 --> 01:22:55.001
Lulu, it's not funny!
It's my livelihood!

01:22:56.209 --> 01:22:57.917
I'm facing bankruptcy.

01:22:58.084 --> 01:23:01.001
He can't play anymore,
so he has the dogs play.

01:23:01.167 --> 01:23:03.751
- And we're going!
- We're going.

01:23:03.917 --> 01:23:04.917
Okay.

01:23:18.459 --> 01:23:21.126
Ladies... this dog needs nobody!

01:23:24.626 --> 01:23:26.209
She'll never learn.

01:23:30.209 --> 01:23:32.042
Warm up everybody!

01:23:33.251 --> 01:23:34.626
What's all this?

01:23:35.959 --> 01:23:37.626
Welcome! Doggie soccer.

01:23:37.792 --> 01:23:40.959
Ludwig, Urmel, Charlie, Lumpi.
They're all my clients.

01:23:41.126 --> 01:23:43.667
- I'm almost bankrupt.
- So we're in the same boat.

01:23:43.834 --> 01:23:45.292
I am not in your boat.

01:23:45.459 --> 01:23:47.042
What did you think?

01:23:47.667 --> 01:23:50.459
Dogs are all different.
Some hunt, others herd.

01:23:50.626 --> 01:23:54.167
Just like soccer.
You've got forwards, defense, midfield.

01:23:54.334 --> 01:23:56.584
Exactly. Silke, what's the problem?

01:23:56.751 --> 01:24:00.584
Really. This boy's got a real
talent for dogs. Now we have fun.

01:24:00.751 --> 01:24:01.959
Everybody's happy-

01:24:02.126 --> 01:24:05.126
Come on, Oli, blow the whistle.
- I like the idea.

01:24:08.292 --> 01:24:09.292
So,

01:24:11.209 --> 01:24:13.417
let's start the match.

01:24:15.876 --> 01:24:17.626
Hey, look.

01:24:19.334 --> 01:24:21.417
Dude, I swear, it'll be great.

01:24:21.917 --> 01:24:25.209
New ball, so you don't get it
stuck in your teeth. Got it?

01:24:27.376 --> 01:24:28.876
One, two...

01:24:34.501 --> 01:24:38.209
Look, the little black one is like you.
He runs from the ball.

01:24:38.376 --> 01:24:40.792
And he's even got your hair.

01:24:41.667 --> 01:24:44.667
That's why I'm betting on him.
You in? 500 euros.

01:24:44.834 --> 01:24:46.126
- You in?
- I'm in.

01:24:46.959 --> 01:24:47.959
On that big guy-

01:24:48.042 --> 01:24:50.376
Go, Simpson! Get the ball!

01:24:51.042 --> 01:24:52.751
Yes, yes, yes!

01:24:58.584 --> 01:25:01.126
- Boy, he's pretty good at this.
- Sorry.

01:25:01.292 --> 01:25:02.834
No! You're not playing.

01:25:03.792 --> 01:25:05.917
Get the ball, Simpson!

01:25:10.584 --> 01:25:12.501
One more and you get a yellow card!

01:25:12.667 --> 01:25:14.251
Don't bite it.

01:25:14.417 --> 01:25:16.334
Nice! Balthasar, you do it!

01:25:20.626 --> 01:25:22.167
Simpson, go! Get it.

01:25:22.334 --> 01:25:23.709
Get it, yes!

01:25:25.417 --> 01:25:26.917
Goal!

01:25:27.084 --> 01:25:29.126
Simpson, yeah!

01:25:29.292 --> 01:25:31.542
Well done, Simpson.

01:25:40.459 --> 01:25:42.667
Look, sweetheart.
You're better, right?

01:25:44.334 --> 01:25:45.584
2-1.

01:25:49.459 --> 01:25:51.084
That wasn't yellow!

01:25:51.251 --> 01:25:52.959
- Why is that yellow?
- He bit.

01:25:53.126 --> 01:25:56.417
- That wasn't yellow, Oli.
- It was yellow, he bit on it again.

01:25:56.584 --> 01:25:58.626
- Never a yellow!
- Of course it was.

01:25:58.792 --> 01:26:00.084
But, but...

01:26:04.792 --> 01:26:06.001
- Off!
- Off, Simpson!

01:26:06.542 --> 01:26:07.834
Got it.

01:26:08.001 --> 01:26:11.084
- Mickels, ball.
- Relax. I'm playing with the dogs.

01:26:11.251 --> 01:26:13.501
I don't want you in on my fun.
Give it back.

01:26:13.667 --> 01:26:15.167
Loser thing to say. Here.

01:26:18.667 --> 01:26:20.126
- Take that back.
- What?

01:26:21.292 --> 01:26:22.667
I'd take that back.

01:26:22.834 --> 01:26:26.084
Dude, you're done.
With life, the club, the lady. My turn.

01:26:31.626 --> 01:26:33.167
Men and soccer...

01:26:33.334 --> 01:26:34.876
What a shame, it was fun.

01:26:36.751 --> 01:26:37.834
Oh, boys.

01:26:38.001 --> 01:26:40.876
- Leave the coach alone!
- Oli, you dipshit!

01:26:48.126 --> 01:26:50.751
What's happening?
We haven't done anything yet.

01:26:52.001 --> 01:26:54.501
- No, no! Not in the face!
- Perfect shape, eh?

01:26:54.667 --> 01:26:56.126
Get the ball!

01:27:05.667 --> 01:27:07.001
- Bozer!
- Simpson!

01:27:07.167 --> 01:27:08.876
Help me!

01:27:10.126 --> 01:27:11.959
Put that dog on the leash!

01:27:12.126 --> 01:27:13.334
Are you crazy?

01:27:15.126 --> 01:27:16.501
You're real heroes...

01:27:18.834 --> 01:27:21.167
I just warmed the bench the whole time.

01:27:21.334 --> 01:27:23.126
I only played in two matches.

01:27:24.251 --> 01:27:29.751
Then they write about you,
you draw attention, and you're out.

01:27:32.334 --> 01:27:33.959
I hate self-pity.

01:27:35.251 --> 01:27:39.042
I don't spend all day complaining
I might lose my business.

01:27:39.209 --> 01:27:40.751
Because of you.

01:27:44.709 --> 01:27:46.501
I'm really sorry.

01:27:47.001 --> 01:27:48.667
That doesn't help.

01:27:55.417 --> 01:27:57.042
Come on, Elfriede.

01:28:03.209 --> 01:28:04.959
What about the Rottweiler?

01:28:05.126 --> 01:28:07.251
- Will he be put down?
- No, I'll take him.

01:28:08.126 --> 01:28:10.376
You give the dog a chance, but not him?

01:28:10.542 --> 01:28:12.667
- You should talk.
- Why?

01:28:12.834 --> 01:28:14.584
How about your ranger?

01:28:16.751 --> 01:28:18.751
Does anyone have a euro?

01:28:19.584 --> 01:28:20.959
For the machine.

01:28:25.709 --> 01:28:28.667
Max, answer. It's an emergency
and you're not answering.

01:28:28.834 --> 01:28:31.501
We agreed. Phone switched on, we said.

01:28:31.667 --> 01:28:33.042
Where are the kids?

01:28:33.209 --> 01:28:35.251
Found one, you can stop looking.

01:28:35.417 --> 01:28:38.167
I don't get it. Voice mail, every time.

01:28:38.334 --> 01:28:39.376
Not available.

01:28:39.542 --> 01:28:42.751
If I were a man dealing with you,
I'd go nuts. Really.

01:28:46.042 --> 01:28:47.042
Simpson!

01:28:47.792 --> 01:28:50.292
Just a hairline fracture, not dangerous.

01:28:50.459 --> 01:28:52.959
Come here! Oh, we were lucky.

01:28:53.126 --> 01:28:55.126
We were lucky.

01:28:59.501 --> 01:29:02.584
That's so typical! Too late.

01:29:03.042 --> 01:29:05.084
Come on, Simpson.

01:29:06.167 --> 01:29:07.751
Nico will be so happy.

01:29:08.709 --> 01:29:11.376
So there you finally are.
Where have you been?

01:29:11.542 --> 01:29:13.876
Why are you unreachable
when I need you?

01:29:14.042 --> 01:29:16.542
I called what seemed like 20 times.

01:29:19.459 --> 01:29:20.459
Simpson!

01:29:22.251 --> 01:29:24.042
Hey, Simpson, feeling better?

01:29:24.876 --> 01:29:26.459
Come here. Feeling better?

01:29:27.709 --> 01:29:28.751
Simpson, stop!

01:29:30.959 --> 01:29:33.042
- Stop!
- I didn't do anything to him.

01:29:33.209 --> 01:29:35.167
What's wrong with him?

01:29:35.334 --> 01:29:37.751
- Maybe something's wrong with you.
- What?

01:29:37.917 --> 01:29:40.209
Your smell changes when you're sick.

01:30:02.751 --> 01:30:03.834
Hello.

01:30:04.001 --> 01:30:05.292
Professor Dr. Seligmann.

01:30:07.501 --> 01:30:08.501
Hello.

01:30:09.876 --> 01:30:12.292
Dogs have instincts that are invaluable.

01:30:12.459 --> 01:30:16.126
- I know. What does my husband have?
- I was just about to tell you.

01:30:16.292 --> 01:30:19.542
- You dog sensed something was wrong.
- What is it?

01:30:19.709 --> 01:30:21.209
An intestinal tumor.

01:30:23.209 --> 01:30:24.876
It's in an early stage.

01:30:26.292 --> 01:30:28.792
- We'll just have to do a colectomy.
- What?

01:30:28.959 --> 01:30:30.501
It's a simple operation.

01:30:30.667 --> 01:30:33.209
We remove a part
of your ascending intestine.

01:30:33.376 --> 01:30:35.376
But we have to operate right away.

01:30:35.542 --> 01:30:39.334
No, no, I can't. I'm a pianist,
I have a concert in two days.

01:30:39.501 --> 01:30:41.084
It's out of the question.

01:30:42.626 --> 01:30:44.626
Free will is God's kingdom.

01:30:47.459 --> 01:30:50.001
But then right after the concert.

01:31:52.084 --> 01:31:54.001
I've been through all this once.

01:31:54.167 --> 01:31:56.792
My ex-girlfriend said
she didn't care either.

01:31:56.959 --> 01:31:58.792
Then she changed her mind.

01:31:58.959 --> 01:32:01.459
Now she has a husband,
two kids, she's happy.

01:32:01.626 --> 01:32:03.626
That's exactly what you want too.

01:32:04.334 --> 01:32:05.917
I need you to stop it.

01:32:12.459 --> 01:32:14.251
Bozer, go to mom.

01:32:14.417 --> 01:32:15.417
Go.

01:32:17.042 --> 01:32:20.709
- You taught him that trick.
- You think I practiced with him?

01:32:20.876 --> 01:32:22.459
He does whatever he wants.

01:32:23.084 --> 01:32:24.542
You do the same then.

01:32:40.292 --> 01:32:42.209
Why is he so stubborn, Bozer?

01:32:45.334 --> 01:32:46.334
Why?

01:32:46.751 --> 01:32:48.834
You can't force it.

01:32:49.001 --> 01:32:52.334
It is what it is. I'm hungry.

01:32:53.376 --> 01:32:54.751
What did you say?

01:32:54.917 --> 01:32:56.584
Let's go to sleep.

01:32:58.251 --> 01:32:59.251
Okay.

01:33:14.001 --> 01:33:16.334
Good morning. I made coffee.

01:33:39.792 --> 01:33:42.751
Just stop. It's not always about you.

01:34:07.917 --> 01:34:10.459
- Karina! Have a nice evening.
- You too. Bye.

01:34:13.709 --> 01:34:14.792
Ella?

01:34:14.959 --> 01:34:17.626
So when is your article
coming to fruition?

01:34:20.001 --> 01:34:22.959
If you don't write anything,
I can't print anything.

01:34:23.126 --> 01:34:24.751
- I know.
- But...

01:34:26.042 --> 01:34:29.417
Since the issue
does have to see the light of day...

01:34:32.126 --> 01:34:34.292
okay, I'll just use one of my articles.

01:34:34.876 --> 01:34:36.292
What's going on with you?

01:34:40.167 --> 01:34:41.834
I'm going to be a father.

01:34:42.751 --> 01:34:44.084
Oh, God.

01:34:45.084 --> 01:34:48.126
It's like a miracle.
I'm so nervous.

01:34:48.834 --> 01:34:50.501
You're okay with it, right?

01:34:51.042 --> 01:34:54.584
Somehow, it was meant to be.

01:34:55.876 --> 01:34:57.459
You just can't force it.

01:34:57.626 --> 01:34:59.084
Oscar!

01:34:59.251 --> 01:35:01.167
Kiera! I'm coming.

01:35:02.126 --> 01:35:04.751
Gotta go. We're going to a concert.

01:35:04.917 --> 01:35:07.126
Kiera got the tickets.

01:35:07.792 --> 01:35:09.376
- Wow.
- Look.

01:35:18.334 --> 01:35:19.667
Oscar is a real connard.

01:35:20.792 --> 01:35:23.209
- What?
- An asshole.

01:35:24.334 --> 01:35:25.334
Right.

01:35:27.834 --> 01:35:29.751
I'm doing dog therapy.

01:35:30.626 --> 01:35:32.334
- What?
- Dog therapy.

01:35:32.876 --> 01:35:34.167
What's that?

01:35:34.334 --> 01:35:36.876
It's therapy for no fear of dogs.

01:35:42.751 --> 01:35:45.042
Ah, I'm so happy.

01:35:45.209 --> 01:35:47.209
I'm so incredibly happy.

01:36:01.001 --> 01:36:03.042
Do you have alcohol and cigarettes?

01:36:03.209 --> 01:36:06.167
Yup. A whole store full.
Can you be more specific?

01:36:09.667 --> 01:36:12.626
- None of it is healthy.
- I know.

01:36:13.792 --> 01:36:14.792
So?

01:36:19.542 --> 01:36:20.542
Bozer!

01:36:21.584 --> 01:36:23.751
My dog is gone. Did you see anything?

01:36:23.917 --> 01:36:26.376
They steal dogs like crazy around here.

01:36:27.292 --> 01:36:29.876
They fight them illegally.

01:36:30.042 --> 01:36:32.542
- It's not fun to watch.
- What?

01:36:32.709 --> 01:36:35.959
No, no. He just runs away.

01:36:52.834 --> 01:36:55.292
Mrs. Klein has been gone for three days.

01:36:55.459 --> 01:36:56.542
Where is she?

01:36:57.209 --> 01:36:58.876
In the basement.

01:36:59.042 --> 01:37:00.709
- Basement?
- Well...

01:37:01.209 --> 01:37:04.709
She was, but tomorrow
she'll be in heaven, in the forest.

01:37:04.876 --> 01:37:08.251
She organized it herself.
I've never seen anything like it.

01:37:08.417 --> 01:37:09.834
She gave me this for you.

01:37:40.251 --> 01:37:42.834
Oscar, the child's not yours.

01:38:46.126 --> 01:38:47.209
Bozer!

01:38:56.042 --> 01:38:57.251
Bozer!

01:39:09.459 --> 01:39:11.042
Come on, Elfriede.

01:41:18.584 --> 01:41:19.917
Fuck happiness.

01:42:16.751 --> 01:42:18.959
What are you doing?

01:42:19.126 --> 01:42:20.917
Come on, come here.

01:42:24.292 --> 01:42:25.667
What are you doing there?

01:42:25.834 --> 01:42:27.501
I strayed from the path.

01:42:27.667 --> 01:42:30.126
- You did what?
- Strayed from the path.

01:42:31.459 --> 01:42:34.542
How did you manage that?
That takes some doing.

01:42:34.709 --> 01:42:37.209
I mean, the path is wide.

01:42:39.084 --> 01:42:40.834
The Berlin Wall ran along here.

01:42:41.001 --> 01:42:42.417
They'd have shot you.

01:42:42.584 --> 01:42:44.667
But now, it's great for a walk.

01:42:44.834 --> 01:42:48.334
I'm here every evening.
With Condor. Every evening.

01:42:48.501 --> 01:42:49.209
Right.

01:42:49.376 --> 01:42:51.251
- But nobody's ever fallen in.
- Right.

01:42:51.417 --> 01:42:53.209
Or did you do it on purpose?

01:42:53.376 --> 01:42:55.917
Doesn't matter. Just help me out.

01:42:57.167 --> 01:42:58.501
That's easy to say.

01:42:58.667 --> 01:43:00.084
Just give me your hand.

01:43:00.251 --> 01:43:01.251
- Hand?
- Yes.

01:43:01.376 --> 01:43:03.084
- I'll try.
- Thank you.

01:43:03.251 --> 01:43:04.667
- Give me a paw.
- Right.

01:43:06.501 --> 01:43:08.292
Wow, you weigh something...

01:43:48.042 --> 01:43:51.001
What remains of Esther Klein
is our memories.

01:43:51.834 --> 01:43:54.126
What has departed belongs to this Earth.

01:44:10.001 --> 01:44:11.751
What happened?

01:44:11.917 --> 01:44:13.792
I went swimming.

01:44:20.626 --> 01:44:22.292
Your body is gone.

01:44:23.626 --> 01:44:25.042
Earth to earth,

01:44:25.834 --> 01:44:28.167
ashes to ashes,

01:44:28.334 --> 01:44:30.126
dust to dust.

01:44:30.292 --> 01:44:31.667
Rest in peace.

01:44:31.834 --> 01:44:33.084
Amen.

01:44:36.626 --> 01:44:38.126
Where's Bozer?

01:44:40.751 --> 01:44:42.417
He's gone.

01:44:43.459 --> 01:44:44.792
Gone where?

01:44:46.334 --> 01:44:47.751
He ran away.

01:44:51.001 --> 01:44:53.709
Come on, Elfi. We need to get going.

01:44:58.167 --> 01:45:00.251
It's all good, all good.

01:45:43.626 --> 01:45:45.917
Welcome to a life without cancer.

01:45:47.584 --> 01:45:50.334
You're getting a new inspection sticker.

01:45:51.042 --> 01:45:52.376
Good to go.

01:45:53.459 --> 01:45:55.542
Your family is waiting with the dog.

01:45:55.709 --> 01:45:57.042
But he's not allowed in.

01:45:57.209 --> 01:45:59.584
I'd like to make an exception, but...

01:45:59.751 --> 01:46:01.084
hospital.

01:46:04.167 --> 01:46:06.001
There's my Simpson.

01:46:09.126 --> 01:46:10.792
He saved my life.

01:46:11.751 --> 01:46:14.709
And he's the only one
who accepts Nico as he is.

01:46:20.417 --> 01:46:23.001
Tomorrow, you take Nico
to horse therapy.

01:46:23.167 --> 01:46:24.251
What?

01:46:24.417 --> 01:46:26.334
Where's your sense of humor?

01:46:32.542 --> 01:46:35.459
Your boss wants the apartment.
I'll make you a deal.

01:46:35.626 --> 01:46:39.751
I owe you guys 280.
Now you owe me 320. I want 100 now.

01:46:39.917 --> 01:46:42.084
So, 600,000 for the apartment, eh?

01:46:42.251 --> 01:46:44.792
- You owe me a dog.
- I don't owe you anything.

01:46:44.959 --> 01:46:48.792
Loneliness. It's the number one
reason people get a dog.

01:46:55.709 --> 01:46:56.834
Here.

01:46:57.001 --> 01:46:59.584
It's the key to the doggie wagon.

01:46:59.751 --> 01:47:01.834
You can certainly use it.

01:47:02.001 --> 01:47:03.834
I also paid your back rent.

01:47:06.334 --> 01:47:10.209
- You're back, huh?
- She called... and apologized.

01:47:10.376 --> 01:47:12.251
Not every woman would do that.

01:47:12.876 --> 01:47:15.167
I'm actually only here because of you.

01:47:15.334 --> 01:47:16.501
Really?

01:47:23.459 --> 01:47:25.834
What are you going to do now?

01:47:28.001 --> 01:47:31.751
We're going on a walkabout to
Marseilles. Her old home town.

01:47:32.751 --> 01:47:36.334
- We just came to say goodbye.
- Let's hope it's not forever.

01:47:43.917 --> 01:47:46.084
He's kind of like a boomerang.

01:47:48.376 --> 01:47:49.376
Bozer!

01:47:49.542 --> 01:47:52.001
A woman brought him in.
She was really upset.

01:47:54.126 --> 01:47:55.626
So, take him.

01:47:55.792 --> 01:47:57.459
I have a concert this evening.

01:48:03.542 --> 01:48:05.334
- Go away!
- Galileo!

01:48:05.501 --> 01:48:08.376
- That's your dog? That's Galileo?
- Oh my.

01:48:08.542 --> 01:48:09.709
Lulu!

01:48:11.209 --> 01:48:13.584
I thought you'd never find me,

01:48:13.751 --> 01:48:15.084
professor.

01:48:20.084 --> 01:48:23.792
As far as your problem goes,
the doctors are so advanced.

01:48:23.959 --> 01:48:26.334
I'm sure something can be done.

01:48:27.917 --> 01:48:30.209
- Mom, leave it.
- Can you bring me coffee?

01:48:30.376 --> 01:48:32.376
- I'll do it.
- You stay put.

01:48:32.876 --> 01:48:34.709
We want to adopt babies anyway,

01:48:35.292 --> 01:48:37.626
from Namibia, Nigeria, Würzburg...

01:48:42.917 --> 01:48:44.209
It's not mine.

01:48:44.751 --> 01:48:47.584
Not your thing? The article is fabulous.

01:48:47.751 --> 01:48:49.626
Ella has a real nose.

01:48:49.792 --> 01:48:52.417
Her next article's "Follow the Dog."

01:48:52.584 --> 01:48:54.417
Not a single line will be cut.

01:48:54.584 --> 01:48:57.751
Not the article, the child, Harald.

01:48:58.667 --> 01:48:59.709
The child.

01:49:02.001 --> 01:49:03.959
The child is not mine.

01:49:05.501 --> 01:49:08.709
Your street mutt
got my pedigree pregnant.

01:49:10.709 --> 01:49:14.209
We can't sell these mongrels.
They're more or less worthless.

01:49:14.376 --> 01:49:16.126
Oh, what a shame.

01:49:18.959 --> 01:49:20.126
So cute.

01:49:40.584 --> 01:49:42.209
And where are the martinis?

01:49:44.334 --> 01:49:45.751
Hi everyone!

01:49:48.126 --> 01:49:50.292
Just put a muzzle on it.
