00:57.190 --> 01:00.092
- I heard a sound.

01:00.094 --> 01:01.827
A wind.

01:01.829 --> 01:04.196
A strong wind.

01:04.197 --> 01:06.298
<i>And then a whisper in that wind.</i>

01:09.069 --> 01:12.504
<i>Remnants. Fragments.</i>

01:12.506 --> 01:14.173
<i>Shattered pieces
of an illusive memory</i>

01:14.175 --> 01:17.609
<i>steeped in pixilated streaks
and auto-tracked frames.</i>

01:20.914 --> 01:23.549
<i>A laugh, a kiss.</i>

01:26.753 --> 01:28.287
<i>Where am I?</i>

01:29.390 --> 01:32.424
<i>In your arms? Your lap?</i>

01:32.426 --> 01:34.593
<i>On your shoulders?</i>

01:37.730 --> 01:40.599
Tap, tap, tapping like the rap,
rap, rapping of the raven.

01:42.502 --> 01:45.037
<i>That wind would become rain.</i>

01:45.039 --> 01:49.842
<i>That rain would become snow
and that snow would become ice.</i>

01:49.844 --> 01:52.611
<i>That ice will melt back
to the sky.</i>

01:54.648 --> 01:57.916
We are born of muscle,
of meat and of blood.

01:57.918 --> 02:03.088
<i>Not from loving arms,
nor brutality or harm.</i>

02:03.090 --> 02:05.157
<i>As family is, as family does.</i>

02:05.159 --> 02:11.463
<i>Brother, sister, mother, father.</i>

02:11.465 --> 02:13.899
<i>We are lodged and trapped
in every pore.</i>

02:15.168 --> 02:18.437
But that is our skin,
nothing more.

02:18.439 --> 02:20.339
<i>We are at one
with the floorboards,</i>

02:20.341 --> 02:22.508
<i>the tin roof and the sky.</i>

02:35.755 --> 02:38.157
<i>We are left with two questions.</i>

02:41.928 --> 02:43.195
- Hey, Jacks.

02:44.097 --> 02:45.797
Hello?

02:45.799 --> 02:47.499
- Hey.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.935
- Writing poetry on our
precious company time again?

02:49.937 --> 02:54.606
- Artists write poetry.
Assholes just complain.

02:54.608 --> 02:57.943
- True. How long
till the big day again?

02:57.945 --> 03:00.913
- Three more months
and I'll be a daddy.

03:00.915 --> 03:03.749
- It's Andy, right?
- Unless he got a sex change

03:03.751 --> 03:06.618
in the womb,
yes, that's the plan.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.287
- That's so awesome, bro.

03:08.289 --> 03:12.090
- Thanks. Don't call me bro.
We're not 17.

03:12.092 --> 03:14.193
It makes you seem old.
Depressing.

03:14.195 --> 03:17.162
- Look, asshole, I was just
gonna get a cup of coffee.

03:17.164 --> 03:20.065
Do you want something or not?

03:20.067 --> 03:24.036
- No, I'm good. Thanks, man.
- I see. Man's okay, not bro.

03:24.038 --> 03:27.973
- You are a man, right?
Thus I can call you as such.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.775
However, you are not my brother.

03:29.777 --> 03:32.878
Does that make sense?
You see the difference?

03:32.880 --> 03:35.514
- Dude, you're such a dick.
See ya later.

03:51.632 --> 03:52.764
- Jack Thurlow.

03:52.766 --> 03:55.434
<i>- Jack Thurlow?
- Yep. Just said it.</i>

03:55.436 --> 03:58.270
<i>- Derrick Thompson with Hudson
valley sheriff's department.</i>

03:58.272 --> 04:00.439
<i>I'm sorry to tell you,
but there's been an accident.</i>

04:00.441 --> 04:03.175
- Wh-wh-what kind of accident?
- <i>Your parents...</i>

04:03.177 --> 04:06.645
<i>Damien and Theresa Thurlow...</i>

04:06.647 --> 04:08.814
<i>They... they lost control
of their car last night.</i>

04:12.218 --> 04:14.720
- Are they alright?

04:16.022 --> 04:17.956
-<i> I'm so sorry.</i>

04:52.258 --> 04:55.260
- <i>Hi, babe.</i>
- Hiya, beautiful.

04:55.262 --> 04:58.130
- <i>How's our tree house?</i>
- Ah, it's alright.

04:58.132 --> 05:01.667
Same ol', same ol'. How's, um...
How's your grandmother?

05:02.902 --> 05:04.369
-<i> Hmm...</i>

05:04.371 --> 05:05.904
<i>Hold on.</i>

05:07.974 --> 05:11.910
<i>Sorry. I just didn't want
my mom or uncle to hear this.</i>

05:11.912 --> 05:15.647
<i>Baby, she's fucking dying.</i>

05:15.649 --> 05:17.416
<i>And no one will admit it.</i>

05:17.418 --> 05:20.552
<i>It's like they're too English
or something.</i>

05:20.554 --> 05:23.188
<i>I'm just...</i>

05:23.190 --> 05:25.357
<i>tired.</i>

05:25.359 --> 05:28.126
- Well... why are you still up?

05:28.128 --> 05:29.594
-<i> Um... I don't know.</i>

05:29.596 --> 05:32.497
<i>Couldn't sleep. I...</i>

05:32.499 --> 05:34.900
<i>My uncle's house
is really creepy.</i>

05:34.902 --> 05:39.304
<i>The wind...
Just rattles and rattles.</i>

05:39.306 --> 05:41.440
<i>Taps and taps.</i>

05:43.142 --> 05:46.478
<i>But, hey, the good news!
Our little one's doing well.</i>

05:46.480 --> 05:48.513
- Let me see.

05:55.188 --> 05:58.156
<i>- Hey, what's that jacket
you're wearing?</i>

05:58.158 --> 06:01.860
- Hmm? Oh, it's, uh...
It's my dad's.

06:01.862 --> 06:04.096
He died today.

06:04.098 --> 06:05.697
-<i> What?</i>

06:05.699 --> 06:08.467
- Yeah, uh... he and my mom
were at the cabin and apparently

06:08.469 --> 06:10.068
when they were driving
back to the city,

06:10.070 --> 06:12.170
they lost control of the car
and flew off the highway.

06:12.172 --> 06:16.441
My mom made it. Minor injuries.
She's home now, but, um...

06:16.443 --> 06:18.477
Yeah, my dad's...
My dad's dead.

06:20.113 --> 06:22.647
They didn't wanna give details,
but I got them anyway.

06:22.649 --> 06:25.784
So I guess the...
The windshield severed his head

06:25.786 --> 06:28.320
clean off his body,
or at least nearly clean off.

06:28.322 --> 06:29.855
I guess there was still some...

06:29.857 --> 06:31.656
Ligaments attached
to the back of his neck.

06:31.658 --> 06:33.959
And then the wheel
broke all of his ribs

06:33.961 --> 06:35.527
and caused
massive internal bleeding,

06:35.529 --> 06:36.928
which would've killed him
anyway,

06:36.930 --> 06:39.131
regardless of his head
getting chopped off.

06:39.133 --> 06:40.732
Fuck, man.

06:45.104 --> 06:47.105
-<i> Baby...</i>

06:47.107 --> 06:49.975
<i>Love of my life...</i>

06:49.977 --> 06:53.678
<i>I-I don't know what to say.
I don't know... what to do.</i>

06:53.680 --> 06:58.016
- Do? Say?
There's nothing to do or say.

06:58.018 --> 07:01.286
Um... we live, we drive,
we crash, we die.

07:01.288 --> 07:03.188
Had to happen sometime.

07:03.190 --> 07:07.726
<i>- Jack... you're scaring me.
- What do you mean? I'm fine.</i>

07:07.728 --> 07:09.294
Like,
I'm already at peace with it.

07:09.296 --> 07:11.463
It's weird. It's crazy, right?

07:13.599 --> 07:15.767
-<i> Your dad was your best friend.</i>

07:19.405 --> 07:20.872
<i>God, I'm so sorry.</i>

07:20.874 --> 07:23.141
- Shhh. Stop it. It's fine.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.577
I'm... I'm fine. Really.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.213
I mean it.

08:01.714 --> 08:04.015
<i>- Hey, it's Shanda.
Leave a message.</i>

08:04.017 --> 08:07.285
<i>Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.</i>

08:07.287 --> 08:09.821
- Hey. It's me.

08:09.823 --> 08:13.492
Um, I don't know if you got
the voicemail I left you earlier

08:13.494 --> 08:16.127
about the accident
and my parents.

08:16.129 --> 08:18.697
Uh... yeah, I...

08:18.699 --> 08:21.032
I just wanted to touch base.

08:21.034 --> 08:24.202
I'll probably get in
around 1:00 tomorrow,

08:24.204 --> 08:27.405
just cab it from the airport.

08:27.407 --> 08:31.610
Uh, anyway, I'm fine.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.445
Excited to see you, shithead.

09:04.043 --> 09:05.911
- Yeah, I had...
I had to come out here.

09:05.913 --> 09:08.680
He's my best friend.
I changed my flight to his.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.215
I think he's asleep.

09:10.217 --> 09:14.619
Yeah, yeah,
I'll see you... then.

09:14.621 --> 09:17.389
Yeah, love you, too.
Okay, bye.

09:17.391 --> 09:20.125
Ahem.

09:38.211 --> 09:41.012
- Ah...

09:43.249 --> 09:45.083
- Jack?

09:49.188 --> 09:52.991
Jack, I think
you're sleepwalking again.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.693
- Ah...

09:54.695 --> 09:57.963
- I don't wanna wake you
or upset you,

09:57.965 --> 10:01.266
but you need to go back to bed,
okay?

10:01.268 --> 10:04.269
You have to wake up early
tomorrow...

10:04.271 --> 10:07.172
For the airport.

10:16.749 --> 10:20.385
Jack, what...
What are you saying?

10:23.522 --> 10:26.658
What are you saying, Jack?

10:26.660 --> 10:29.127
- Anne frank.

10:30.363 --> 10:32.330
- What?

10:32.332 --> 10:33.865
- Up there.

10:35.534 --> 10:38.536
I... want... you...

10:38.538 --> 10:40.305
- Up where?

10:40.307 --> 10:43.208
- I'll go up there, too.

10:47.446 --> 10:50.615
Attic.

10:50.617 --> 10:51.750
A...

10:51.752 --> 10:56.021
- What's in the attic... Jack?

10:56.023 --> 10:57.989
- Oh.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.624
Uh...

10:59.626 --> 11:01.926
I'm in the attic.

11:01.928 --> 11:05.063
Oh.

11:05.065 --> 11:08.566
Oh!!!

11:08.568 --> 11:11.236
Fuuu...!!

11:11.238 --> 11:13.104
I'm in the attic!!
- It's okay.

11:13.106 --> 11:16.207
I'm in the attic!!
I'm in the attic!

11:16.209 --> 11:18.009
Hey, hey, hey!

11:37.730 --> 11:39.931
Hi.
- Hey.

11:39.933 --> 11:44.135
- I don't remember
falling asleep last night.

11:47.239 --> 11:48.606
- Hmm. Fuck.

11:48.608 --> 11:50.308
What time is it?

11:50.310 --> 11:51.443
- Seven-ish.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.448
You sleepwalked last night.

11:58.617 --> 12:01.753
- Did I?

12:01.755 --> 12:04.089
Fuck.
I haven't done that in years.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.893
- Yeah, well... you went crazy.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.328
You beat the shit outta me.

12:10.330 --> 12:13.531
- Jesus Christ. I'm so sorry.

12:13.533 --> 12:16.735
- Hey, better me
than your baby momma, right?

12:16.737 --> 12:18.570
Fuck it.

12:18.572 --> 12:21.840
So, uh, what's in the attic?

12:23.909 --> 12:25.710
- The attic?

12:25.712 --> 12:31.316
- Yeah, you, uh, kept screaming
on and on about... the attic.

12:35.354 --> 12:37.088
- I have no idea.

12:39.925 --> 12:43.094
- Look, just so you know...

12:43.096 --> 12:45.997
I'd do anything for you,
you stupid bitch.

12:45.999 --> 12:48.533
- I'd do anything for you,
you lazy whore.

12:52.538 --> 12:54.506
- We better start packing.

12:55.708 --> 12:57.876
You're going home.

14:06.745 --> 14:08.146
- Mom?!

14:16.755 --> 14:18.356
Mom?

14:57.563 --> 14:59.297
Mom?

15:00.299 --> 15:01.866
Mom?

15:01.868 --> 15:04.769
- Oh...

15:04.771 --> 15:06.804
Oh, Jack.

15:06.806 --> 15:09.908
My god. You're here.

15:09.910 --> 15:12.911
- 'Course I am.

15:12.913 --> 15:16.080
Give me this.

15:16.082 --> 15:20.018
- Be very careful.
Careful, careful, careful.

15:26.125 --> 15:27.959
- How's your pain level?

15:33.599 --> 15:36.567
- Oh.

15:36.569 --> 15:39.170
It's... it's good.

15:39.172 --> 15:41.439
Not bad at all, really.

15:48.580 --> 15:50.348
- Where's rusty?

15:51.884 --> 15:53.785
- Oh, my god.

15:53.787 --> 15:56.888
He's still at the vet.
We didn't take him to the cabin.

15:56.890 --> 15:59.657
- Why not?
- The owls.

15:59.659 --> 16:01.459
They drive him crazy.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.462
You can get him tomorrow
afternoon, if you want.

16:07.967 --> 16:12.403
Well, for godssake,
give your mother a hug.

16:14.740 --> 16:16.541
Oh...

16:18.077 --> 16:20.678
- I'm so sorry, mom.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.213
I'm so sorry.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.718
- For what?

16:26.720 --> 16:29.721
- For... the accident,

16:29.723 --> 16:31.356
that I wasn't here sooner.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.424
- Well, that makes no sense.
You're sorry?

16:33.426 --> 16:35.493
You had nothing to do with it.

16:36.595 --> 16:38.162
- I wasn't saying I'm sorry

16:38.164 --> 16:39.831
like it was the conclusion
of an argument.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.199
I was just being nice.

16:41.201 --> 16:44.669
- Well, you don't need
to be nice.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.538
None of this is nice.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.608
You need to be here
and you are, so I thank you.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.543
I thank you for that.

16:52.545 --> 16:56.147
Because your daddy
would appreciate it too.

17:11.930 --> 17:15.032
One hour, honey.

17:15.035 --> 17:16.733
- Awesome.

17:24.242 --> 17:25.777
So are you gonna play?

17:27.746 --> 17:30.782
- Play? Wh-what do you mean?

17:30.784 --> 17:34.552
- Violin. At... at the funeral.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.655
- Oh. Um...

17:37.657 --> 17:42.860
Whoo...
I don't know what I would play.

17:42.862 --> 17:44.929
- I dunno...

17:44.931 --> 17:47.598
Dad always liked that Chopin
piece that you transposed.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.033
- No, no, no, no.

17:49.035 --> 17:53.271
That piece is for keys,
not strings.

17:53.273 --> 17:58.309
But if it's really important
to you, I-I'll...

17:58.311 --> 18:00.411
I'll see what I can do.

18:05.117 --> 18:07.318
- Look, I swear to god,
nobody on this planet

18:07.320 --> 18:08.986
makes better fucking lasagna
than you.

18:08.988 --> 18:12.490
- Hey now. Is that any way to
talk at the dining-room table?

18:12.492 --> 18:17.028
- Please. My table etiquette
was intrinsically bound

18:17.030 --> 18:19.197
from within
at far too young an age.

18:22.067 --> 18:23.734
- There it is.

18:24.970 --> 18:27.605
- There what is?

18:27.607 --> 18:29.173
- Your father.

18:31.443 --> 18:34.812
He had a mouth
that could run a marathon.

18:34.814 --> 18:39.383
He could spout a thousand
words in 25 nanoseconds.

18:41.320 --> 18:44.589
It was in him
and now it is in you.

18:56.602 --> 18:58.269
- Jesus Christ.

18:58.271 --> 18:59.670
How are you...

18:59.672 --> 19:04.509
- How am I what?
- How are you you right now?

19:04.511 --> 19:07.311
So okay?

19:07.313 --> 19:09.847
- What am I supposed
to be doing?

19:09.849 --> 19:11.716
Am I supposed to be crying?

19:11.718 --> 19:15.153
- Yes. Yes.

19:15.155 --> 19:16.654
- You're not.

19:16.656 --> 19:17.855
- I never cry.

19:17.857 --> 19:20.224
But you cry
every five fucking minutes,

19:20.226 --> 19:23.427
so what the fuck?

19:23.429 --> 19:26.063
You were in an accident.

19:26.065 --> 19:29.534
A fatal and painful accident.

19:29.536 --> 19:32.603
Dad got his head chopped off
right next to you.

19:32.605 --> 19:35.239
You devoted your life to a man
who is now dead.

19:35.241 --> 19:38.242
You lived with him.
You spoke with him.

19:38.244 --> 19:40.645
You fought with him.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.313
You invited him to your bedroom

19:42.315 --> 19:44.615
and let him come inside you
to create a child.

19:44.617 --> 19:48.586
This child.
This pretentious little fuck.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.888
I-I'm...

19:50.890 --> 19:53.591
I'm yours... and his,

19:53.593 --> 19:56.794
and I wanna share this pain
with you.

20:00.699 --> 20:03.234
- Are you finished?
- I don't know. Am I?

20:06.638 --> 20:10.174
- I'm proud of you.

20:10.176 --> 20:11.742
I am.

20:11.744 --> 20:15.980
You know, right out of the gate,
you had your say with me.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.221
<i>Bravissimo.</i>

20:25.324 --> 20:27.525
Now it's my turn.

20:28.727 --> 20:32.029
I always loved your biting wit,

20:32.031 --> 20:34.999
your acerbic observations,

20:35.001 --> 20:39.770
and - oh, my god -
your immense vocabulary...

20:39.772 --> 20:44.008
when it came to whining...
About something simple

20:44.010 --> 20:48.713
in such an unnecessarily
complicated way,

20:48.715 --> 20:52.917
but as your mother,
I'm gonna tell you right now...

20:52.919 --> 20:54.685
To shut the fuck up.

20:56.655 --> 20:57.989
You wanna sit across from me

20:57.991 --> 20:59.757
at the same table
where I spoon-fed you

20:59.759 --> 21:03.661
and dictate how
I should experience my grief?!

21:05.631 --> 21:10.034
You lost your father
at an unfairly young age,

21:10.036 --> 21:14.171
and that is a hurricane
of hurt and confusion,

21:14.173 --> 21:17.275
and I respect that,

21:17.277 --> 21:19.944
but you make no mistake,

21:19.946 --> 21:23.281
I lost my husband.

21:23.283 --> 21:26.851
I'm gonna tell you something.
I don't care if you are my son,

21:26.853 --> 21:29.987
or if you were my neighbor
or you were my enemy,

21:29.989 --> 21:33.457
I will be goddamned
if anyone is gonna tell me

21:33.459 --> 21:35.059
how I should shed tears

21:35.061 --> 21:39.096
in the name
of my fucking husband!

21:39.098 --> 21:40.631
Ah! Ah!

21:40.633 --> 21:41.866
Ah!

21:49.274 --> 21:51.976
Sometimes...

21:51.978 --> 21:56.480
I regret ever spreading my legs.

24:40.046 --> 24:42.213
<i>Just hold on, buddy.</i>

24:42.215 --> 24:44.849
<i>You are not ready for sleep,
are you?</i>

24:44.851 --> 24:46.717
-<i> No!</i>

24:46.719 --> 24:48.118
- <i>Okay.</i>

24:48.120 --> 24:50.888
<i>Alright. Stop, stop.</i>

24:50.890 --> 24:52.890
<i>One sock.</i>

24:52.892 --> 24:55.559
<i>Two sock.
There we go.</i>

24:55.561 --> 24:59.563
- <i>What is that, daddy?
- It's a tape recorder, my boy.</i>

24:59.565 --> 25:05.269
<i>It's, uh, a device
that makes things last forever.</i>

25:05.271 --> 25:07.505
<i>With this, you can hear me</i>

25:07.507 --> 25:10.441
<i>no matter where you are
or where I am.</i>

25:10.443 --> 25:12.076
-<i> That's weird.</i>

25:15.247 --> 25:18.048
<i>- You were so good
in the car ride over here.</i>

25:18.050 --> 25:19.850
<i>Mommy's not gonna
leave you alone.</i>

25:19.852 --> 25:21.485
She's gonna go right in with you

25:21.487 --> 25:26.156
and make sure nothing happens
to her little love bug. No.

25:26.158 --> 25:29.260
My sweet baby. You're so good.
- Ah, here he is!

25:29.262 --> 25:30.961
- You're so gonna get
lots of treats.

25:30.963 --> 25:34.899
- Oh, yeah. Oh, man.
Oh, fuck, I missed you, buddy.

25:34.901 --> 25:36.500
I don't know
why they put him up here

25:36.502 --> 25:39.069
for a whole fucking month.

25:39.071 --> 25:42.473
My mom never liked him anyway.

25:42.475 --> 25:44.308
- Is that gonna be cash
or credit?

25:44.310 --> 25:47.411
- Uh, credit, please.

25:47.413 --> 25:51.115
- Okay. If you wouldn't mind
just signing a few things here.

25:54.452 --> 25:55.886
I am so sorry.

25:57.622 --> 25:59.290
- Oh. Thank you.

25:59.292 --> 26:01.492
- No, I really mean it.

26:01.494 --> 26:02.893
- I appreciate it.

26:02.895 --> 26:05.496
- Your father really loved you.

26:05.498 --> 26:07.731
He would waltz in here
every week

26:07.733 --> 26:09.567
for rusty's diabetes shot

26:09.569 --> 26:11.969
and he would hold rusty
high over his head

26:11.971 --> 26:13.938
and he would talk
about his two sons, yeah.

26:13.940 --> 26:17.074
You and rusty.
He even made all of us...

26:17.076 --> 26:19.610
We all got a subscription
to <i> look alive</i> magazine

26:19.612 --> 26:21.779
just 'cause he said
you wrote for it.

26:23.381 --> 26:25.115
He was a good man.

26:27.852 --> 26:30.020
- Um... that's it.

26:30.022 --> 26:31.922
Thank you very much... Nancy.

26:31.924 --> 26:34.858
- Oh. Don't forget your card.
- Oh, thank you.

26:37.696 --> 26:39.697
- May god be with you, Jack.

26:44.102 --> 26:45.836
- Can I ask you something,
Nancy?

26:45.838 --> 26:48.238
- You just did.

26:48.240 --> 26:52.643
- Um, how many hours a day
do you work here?

26:52.645 --> 26:55.546
- Twelve.

26:55.548 --> 26:59.216
- And... how many animals
do you see die by euthanasia

26:59.218 --> 27:05.856
or... or... or physical failure
each day?

27:05.858 --> 27:07.891
: About 11 or 12.

27:09.461 --> 27:11.061
- That's about one per hour.

27:12.430 --> 27:15.933
So assuming that these pets
have families,

27:15.935 --> 27:17.935
other than
the lonely old cat lady,

27:17.937 --> 27:21.372
you must see double, triple,
quadruple that in...

27:21.374 --> 27:22.840
In crying faces, right?

27:22.842 --> 27:25.209
Devastated faces.

27:25.211 --> 27:27.745
Tragic faces.

27:27.747 --> 27:30.848
And yet, somehow...

27:30.850 --> 27:34.218
you believe
that god cares about us.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.987
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
I did not mean...

27:36.989 --> 27:40.391
- shhh. Nancy. Nancy.
Nancy, I'm not...

27:40.393 --> 27:43.527
I'm not challenging you.

27:43.529 --> 27:45.796
I'm admiring you.

27:47.265 --> 27:48.999
I'm... reminding myself

27:49.001 --> 27:52.836
that there's still goodness
in the world.

27:52.838 --> 27:57.441
Still good people in the world.

27:57.443 --> 27:59.710
Good people like you, Nancy.

28:02.113 --> 28:04.415
Doh!

28:04.417 --> 28:05.949
Thank you, Nancy.

28:13.091 --> 28:14.825
Mom?

28:14.827 --> 28:17.428
Mom, you awake?

28:17.430 --> 28:20.531
- I need to sleep!

28:20.533 --> 28:23.734
- Okay. Just letting you know
that I... I got rusty.

28:23.736 --> 28:26.170
- Oh, god.

28:26.172 --> 28:30.207
Don't let him scratch the door.
I just hate when he does that.

28:30.209 --> 28:31.508
- Will do.

28:31.510 --> 28:33.811
Uh, Shanda's coming over
a bit later with food.

28:33.813 --> 28:38.482
Do you want anything?
- No. I need to sleep.

28:39.517 --> 28:41.218
- Okay.

28:41.220 --> 28:44.321
- Did you talk
to that whore nurse, Nancy?

28:48.259 --> 28:49.760
- At the vets?

28:49.762 --> 28:52.162
Yeah, she sent her condolences.

28:52.164 --> 28:53.464
- Huh.

28:53.466 --> 28:56.767
I bet she fucking did.

28:56.769 --> 28:58.769
- What does that mean?

29:01.005 --> 29:02.840
- Swear I'm gonna kill
that bitch.

29:02.842 --> 29:05.743
- What bitch?
- What bitch? Crystal!

29:05.745 --> 29:07.111
That fucking bitch.

29:07.113 --> 29:08.979
- You mean crystal,
the love of your life?

29:08.981 --> 29:10.347
- If she's the love of my life,

29:10.349 --> 29:12.349
fucking shoot me
right fucking now.

29:12.351 --> 29:15.018
- Give it an hour, you'll be
in love all over again.

29:15.020 --> 29:17.488
- Pfft!
Shut up and eat your burrito.

29:21.693 --> 29:24.862
The house is so quiet.

29:24.864 --> 29:26.296
- Yeah, it is.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.633
Just like mom always wanted.

29:29.635 --> 29:31.769
Guess she finally got her wish.

29:34.873 --> 29:36.306
- Can I tell you
something that...

29:36.308 --> 29:39.143
You probably shouldn't hear
right now?

29:39.145 --> 29:40.444
- Please do.

29:40.446 --> 29:43.480
Your specialty is providing
unwanted information.

29:45.216 --> 29:47.851
- I always thought this house
was haunted.

29:47.853 --> 29:50.487
- Really? Why?

29:50.489 --> 29:54.057
- I don't know.
Ever since we were kids,

29:54.059 --> 29:57.060
it just felt like
there was some dark vagina

29:57.062 --> 30:00.164
just hovering over this place,
waiting to swallow me up.

30:00.166 --> 30:02.900
- Maybe it was just your latent
homosexuality talking, hmm?

30:02.902 --> 30:05.969
- Shut up. I'm being serious.

30:05.971 --> 30:07.771
I've always been scared here,
dude.

30:07.773 --> 30:10.307
Why do you think
we'd fall asleep in the TV room

30:10.309 --> 30:11.742
and then you'd wake up
in the morning

30:11.744 --> 30:14.478
and find me passed out
in the yard?

30:14.480 --> 30:16.580
Just felt safer outside.

30:16.582 --> 30:19.550
- You'd go outside
'cause you walked in your sleep.

30:19.552 --> 30:21.151
- Hey, so did you.

30:23.021 --> 30:25.355
God, we're so weird.

30:31.462 --> 30:34.398
- Found something in the attic
last night.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.133
- What?

30:36.135 --> 30:39.169
- It was a tape recorder
with a full tape.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.572
It was labeled "for Jack."

30:41.574 --> 30:43.774
- Well, did you listen to it?

30:54.586 --> 30:56.453
- What are you looking at?

31:03.161 --> 31:04.761
- We're best friends.

31:04.763 --> 31:06.797
- Yeah.

31:06.799 --> 31:08.465
- No secrets.
- No secrets.

31:11.603 --> 31:13.337
- To be honest, it wasn't...

31:13.339 --> 31:16.240
Your house
that's always scared me.

31:18.610 --> 31:20.010
It's your mom.

31:20.012 --> 31:22.412
She always scared
the living shit out of me.

31:22.414 --> 31:25.148
I'm sorry, but i...
- no, no, no, no sorries.

31:26.784 --> 31:28.385
- Every time...

31:28.387 --> 31:31.355
I'd leave here
to go back to my house...

31:33.858 --> 31:36.260
I would just be thinking:

31:36.262 --> 31:38.996
good luck.

32:06.724 --> 32:07.958
- Hey!

32:08.927 --> 32:11.295
Peepin' tom.

32:11.297 --> 32:12.996
- Hey.

32:12.998 --> 32:14.932
- What ya doing?

32:15.833 --> 32:18.602
- Smokin'.

32:18.604 --> 32:20.771
- You got a name?

32:20.773 --> 32:21.905
- Jack.

32:21.907 --> 32:23.473
- Duncan.

32:25.910 --> 32:28.679
How come I ain't seen ya before?

32:28.681 --> 32:30.547
- I live in L.A.

32:30.549 --> 32:32.416
I'm just here
for some family shit.

32:32.418 --> 32:34.952
- Ah. I see.

32:34.954 --> 32:37.721
I see.

32:37.723 --> 32:39.222
Hey, do ya wanna do some blow?

32:40.692 --> 32:42.225
- 'Scuse me?

32:42.227 --> 32:44.328
- Said, "do you wanna do
some blow?"

32:47.031 --> 32:50.701
Do you want some or not?
If you don't snort it, I will.

32:54.873 --> 32:56.340
- Symmetry.

32:57.642 --> 32:58.709
See I... oh!

33:12.390 --> 33:13.957
- So what do you say
you're doing back here

33:13.959 --> 33:16.493
when you're all hot shit
parading around Hollywood?

33:16.495 --> 33:19.730
Hmm?
- 'Cause there was an accident.

33:19.732 --> 33:21.264
My dad got his head chopped off.

33:21.266 --> 33:22.566
- Ah, so you're all
full of shit.

33:22.568 --> 33:27.070
- Nah. No, truth, man.
He's dead.

33:27.072 --> 33:28.338
Dead and gone.

33:28.340 --> 33:32.109
As of... 48, 72 hours ago.

33:32.111 --> 33:35.512
I dunno.

33:35.514 --> 33:37.314
- You serious?

33:37.316 --> 33:39.750
- Yeah.

33:39.752 --> 33:41.451
Funeral's coming up.

33:41.453 --> 33:44.888
Fuck.
Helluva lot a work, a funeral.

33:44.890 --> 33:47.090
You're literally planning...

33:47.092 --> 33:50.360
The party... of a lifetime.

33:50.362 --> 33:54.598
Poof.

33:56.434 --> 33:58.635
- Well...

33:58.637 --> 34:00.070
Shit.

34:01.005 --> 34:02.773
Pfft.

34:02.775 --> 34:06.676
I know I'm supposed to say...
I'm sorry, but, um,

34:06.678 --> 34:09.246
but I guess you're
pretty sick and tired

34:09.248 --> 34:11.947
of hearing that by now.

34:11.949 --> 34:14.885
So...

34:14.887 --> 34:17.320
instead, I'll just say...

34:19.556 --> 34:22.659
"fuck, man."

34:22.661 --> 34:24.460
- "Fuck man" is good.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.100
- Did you love him?

34:31.168 --> 34:33.235
- My dad?
- Yeah.

34:34.338 --> 34:36.273
- More than anything.

34:38.443 --> 34:40.409
- Mine was a piece of shit.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.647
He hated me.

34:43.649 --> 34:48.418
No, he hated himself.
Tried to hide a lot of secrets.

34:48.420 --> 34:51.154
And those he couldn't hide,
my mom covered up for him.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.824
A runt and a cunt.

34:56.060 --> 34:57.894
A liar and a lioness.

34:57.896 --> 34:59.463
Rawr.

35:01.799 --> 35:04.401
- You're a child.

35:04.403 --> 35:06.670
Who the fuck are you
to pontificate?

35:06.672 --> 35:09.172
- Oh, man, I'm...
I'm pontificating?

35:09.174 --> 35:11.641
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

35:11.643 --> 35:13.510
Probably don't even know
the meaning of the word.

35:13.512 --> 35:16.046
- Wait. I'm sorry.
What the fuck is your problem?

35:16.048 --> 35:21.084
- Look, Doug, Duncan,
whatever the fuck your name is,

35:21.086 --> 35:23.353
you jerk off in your window
at me.

35:23.355 --> 35:25.088
You seduce me with drugs.

35:25.090 --> 35:28.492
You think you've had a rough
life at 19, but I promise you,

35:28.494 --> 35:32.729
you have no fucking clue
what you're talking about.

35:36.734 --> 35:38.034
- Hmm.

35:42.173 --> 35:43.773
Fuck you.
You're a fucking asshole!

35:44.942 --> 35:46.943
And, more importantly,

35:46.945 --> 35:49.513
you're out of your goddamn mind.

35:54.051 --> 35:55.785
: <i> Okay.</i>

35:55.787 --> 35:59.289
<i>Get yourself all tucked in.
There ya go.</i>

35:59.291 --> 36:02.959
<i>I'm gonna tell you a story
and we'll record it.</i>

36:02.961 --> 36:07.130
<i>That way, it's here whenever
you need to fall asleep, okay?</i>

36:07.132 --> 36:09.599
<i>Hmm.</i>

36:09.601 --> 36:13.003
<i>Once upon a time,
there was a little boy,</i>

36:13.005 --> 36:15.705
<i>and he went to the woods
with his mother.</i>

36:15.707 --> 36:18.875
<i>They planned to pick berries
and flowers of color,</i>

36:18.877 --> 36:22.979
<i>but instead
the boy picked up his brother.</i>

36:22.981 --> 36:26.783
<i>His brother was shy
and so very mean,</i>

36:26.785 --> 36:30.320
<i>and angered himself
at all that was seen.</i>

36:30.322 --> 36:33.623
<i>The angry, old brother,
he needed a friend.</i>

36:33.625 --> 36:38.061
<i>"Come with me," said mother,
and she danced to the end.</i>

36:38.063 --> 36:41.598
<i>The boy, he cried out,
"oh, mother, no, no!"</i>

36:41.600 --> 36:45.068
<i>The mean, old brother cried:
"Let it be so!"</i>

36:45.070 --> 36:48.972
<i>To their surprise,
mother flew to the sky,</i>

36:48.974 --> 36:53.476
<i>darting past sadness
and what makes us cry.</i>

36:53.478 --> 36:57.147
<i>"Now, my dear boys,
you see nothing is wrong,"</i>

36:57.149 --> 37:01.351
<i>their mother sang loudly
amidst flight and song.</i>

37:01.353 --> 37:05.555
<i>You are with me,
the sky and the sea,</i>

37:05.557 --> 37:09.693
<i>you who I love
and you who love me."</i>

37:09.695 --> 37:12.796
<i>The boy sat down
at the edge of the cliff,</i>

37:12.798 --> 37:16.733
<i>tears in his eyes
and wondering if.</i>

37:16.735 --> 37:20.904
<i>But soon he would smile,
because all the while,</i>

37:20.906 --> 37:22.973
<i>it was simply a dream</i>

37:22.975 --> 37:25.475
<i>and no evil scheme.</i>

37:25.477 --> 37:28.745
<i>Mother alight
lifts babe in her arms,</i>

37:28.747 --> 37:31.815
<i>holding him tight
with all of her charms.</i>

37:31.817 --> 37:34.217
<i>She sings a sweet hum,</i>

37:34.219 --> 37:36.519
<i>a dear lovely song,</i>

37:36.521 --> 37:39.122
<i>"till tomorrow, my darling,</i>

37:39.124 --> 37:40.857
<i>here's where you belong."</i>

37:43.661 --> 37:46.363
<i>Jack?</i>

37:46.365 --> 37:47.831
<i>You asleep, Jack?</i>

37:49.433 --> 37:53.203
<i>Okay, good.</i>

37:53.205 --> 37:54.704
<i>Here we go.</i>

37:56.741 --> 37:59.576
<i>When you're all grown up...</i>

37:59.578 --> 38:02.579
<i>When you're a big boy,
a young man,</i>

38:02.581 --> 38:05.115
<i>when you're ready...</i>

38:05.117 --> 38:08.785
<i>You're gonna find this tape.</i>

38:08.787 --> 38:10.086
<i>In the attic.</i>

38:10.088 --> 38:13.023
<i>When you're ready, Jack,</i>

38:13.025 --> 38:15.292
<i>you go up to the attic.</i>

38:20.231 --> 38:22.699
- What? What the fuck?!

38:23.734 --> 38:25.669
C'mon!
- What are you doing?

38:28.039 --> 38:31.775
- You locked the attic.
Wh-wh-why did you lock it?

38:31.777 --> 38:33.576
- What are you talking about?

38:33.578 --> 38:37.580
- This attic was unlocked
a night ago. Now it's not.

38:37.582 --> 38:39.482
Open the fucking door!

38:41.719 --> 38:44.754
- Alright.

38:45.823 --> 38:47.424
You wanna do this?

38:47.426 --> 38:49.726
Let's do it!

38:50.861 --> 38:53.530
I didn't lock the fucking attic,

38:53.532 --> 38:56.032
but I have a feeling
that you wouldn't like

38:56.034 --> 39:00.036
what you found up there,
sweet little boy of mine.

39:00.038 --> 39:05.075
Not yesterday, not today,
and not tomorrow.

39:05.077 --> 39:09.546
So, why don't you just curl up
and cry yourself to sleep

39:09.548 --> 39:11.815
like a good little boy?

39:18.689 --> 39:21.024
I'm gonna sit here...

39:21.026 --> 39:24.427
Until I can trust
that you've gone to sleep.

39:28.933 --> 39:30.400
Good boy.

39:31.369 --> 39:33.403
- This is why, mom.

39:33.405 --> 39:35.505
This is why
I need to go up there.

39:37.508 --> 39:39.275
-<i> In the attic.</i>

39:39.277 --> 39:41.478
<i>When you're ready, Jack,</i>

39:41.480 --> 39:43.513
<i>you go up to the attic.</i>

39:43.515 --> 39:45.915
<i>And, someday,
you'll know the truth.</i>

39:47.118 --> 39:49.619
<i>But just remember...</i>

39:49.621 --> 39:51.921
<i>I love you more than anything.</i>

39:55.559 --> 39:57.460
- What is he talking about?

39:59.797 --> 40:02.132
- Rewind.

40:05.771 --> 40:07.604
Fast-forward.

40:08.439 --> 40:09.873
Stop.

40:09.875 --> 40:13.343
<i>- And, someday,
you'll know the truth.</i>

40:13.345 --> 40:15.912
<i>But just remember...</i>

40:15.914 --> 40:18.448
<i>I love you more than anything.</i>

40:18.450 --> 40:21.451
- Rewind. Play it again.

40:21.453 --> 40:22.952
- Why?
- Just play it again.

40:22.954 --> 40:24.794
Play that piece again right now.
Play it again.

40:27.793 --> 40:31.895
<i>- Just remember...
I love you more than anything.</i>

40:31.897 --> 40:34.731
- Rewind it and play it again.
Play it again!

40:36.401 --> 40:38.601
-<i> I love you more than anything.</i>

40:40.871 --> 40:44.407
- That's all that matters.

40:44.409 --> 40:47.177
That he loved you.

40:47.179 --> 40:49.712
-<i> I love you more than anything.</i>

40:51.549 --> 40:54.684
<i>I love you more than anything.</i>

40:54.686 --> 40:57.353
<i>I love you more than anything.
- He loved you.</i>

41:07.199 --> 41:08.965
Shhh. Shhh...

41:10.367 --> 41:13.536
- First, I just wanna thank
you all so much for coming.

41:13.538 --> 41:16.406
It means a lot to both
my mother and my father.

41:17.909 --> 41:20.076
I believe most of you
have known me since I was...

41:20.078 --> 41:22.812
This big.

41:22.814 --> 41:25.081
So you also know
I'm terrible at public speaking

41:25.083 --> 41:29.252
and I did not prepare a speech
of any kind for today.

41:29.254 --> 41:31.688
But here's what I will say.

41:31.690 --> 41:35.992
My family - the unholy Trinity,
if you will -

41:35.994 --> 41:37.560
could always agree
that a funeral

41:37.562 --> 41:42.899
should never be a funeral...
But a celebration.

41:42.901 --> 41:46.236
That's what today is.
It's a celebration of life...

41:46.238 --> 41:48.238
Well lived.

41:48.240 --> 41:50.940
A life of kindness.

41:50.942 --> 41:53.676
My mother and I truly hope
you believe that.

41:56.046 --> 41:59.816
I... I can still feel my father
standing behind me,

41:59.818 --> 42:02.252
his supportive hand on my back,

42:02.254 --> 42:06.456
telling me I can do anything.

42:06.458 --> 42:07.957
And I look in front of me,

42:07.959 --> 42:11.027
and thank god I have my mother
to tell me the same.

42:11.029 --> 42:15.965
Still standing...
Right here with me.

42:15.967 --> 42:18.535
Now, as my father would've said,

42:18.537 --> 42:21.304
let's celebrate life...

42:21.306 --> 42:23.806
Not death.

42:23.808 --> 42:28.778
Celebrate perseverance...
Not failure.

42:28.780 --> 42:32.482
The future, not the past.

42:32.484 --> 42:34.751
The joy, not the pain.

42:38.489 --> 42:40.189
Here's to you, dad.

42:42.393 --> 42:43.927
And now my mother.

42:45.396 --> 42:47.196
Um...

42:49.033 --> 42:50.300
My mother...

42:54.371 --> 42:56.172
Uh...

43:04.081 --> 43:07.684
That was beautiful, asshole.

43:07.686 --> 43:09.719
- Well... thanks for coming.

43:09.721 --> 43:12.855
- Yeah... real tough choice.

43:12.857 --> 43:18.628
It was either this or happy hour
at the cracker barrel.

43:18.630 --> 43:20.330
- Just give me a minute, okay?

43:26.136 --> 43:28.104
What the hell is the matter
with you?

43:28.106 --> 43:29.706
You have any idea
how awkward that was for me?

43:29.708 --> 43:32.342
You were supposed to close
the whole thing.

43:32.344 --> 43:35.278
- Just take me home.

43:35.280 --> 43:36.879
- Look,
I get that you're hurting,

43:36.881 --> 43:38.147
but you can't put everything
on me.

43:38.149 --> 43:41.451
I'm fucking hurting too.
- Please...

43:41.453 --> 43:43.252
Just take me home.

43:50.127 --> 43:51.661
Please?

44:05.342 --> 44:08.478
Thank you, Shanda.
I'm gonna go lie down.

44:08.480 --> 44:09.879
Jack.

44:16.086 --> 44:18.287
- I have something
I wanna tell you,

44:18.289 --> 44:22.925
and I really want you
to hear it.

44:22.927 --> 44:26.863
You've been so strong
through all of this,

44:26.865 --> 44:29.932
and I know it's hell,
because I've been there.

44:29.934 --> 44:32.468
Losing my mom was probably...

44:32.470 --> 44:35.171
The hardest thing
I've ever had to deal with,

44:35.173 --> 44:37.840
even though she was
a complete psycho bitch.

44:38.942 --> 44:41.778
But... I just want you to know

44:41.780 --> 44:46.182
that no matter what...
I am here.

44:46.184 --> 44:47.850
I am your friend.

44:50.587 --> 44:55.191
And...
What I mean by that... is,

44:55.193 --> 45:00.363
I am here with a huge bag
of weed in my pocket.

45:00.365 --> 45:01.898
And, as your friend,

45:01.900 --> 45:05.234
I demand
that we get very fucking stoned.

45:05.236 --> 45:07.336
- Thanks.

45:11.208 --> 45:12.542
Is that dress yours?

45:12.544 --> 45:14.277
- No. Crystal's.

45:14.279 --> 45:18.414
She, uh, bought it
for her niece's baptism.

45:18.416 --> 45:20.983
- That's ironic.

45:20.985 --> 45:24.721
Bought for a birth,
worn for a death.

45:24.723 --> 45:28.091
- Celebration. Remember?
- Ah... celebration.

45:29.626 --> 45:31.527
- Your words, not mine.

45:31.529 --> 45:34.630
- No. No, my mom's words.

45:34.632 --> 45:38.334
She's always been hell-bent
that funerals aren't sad.

45:38.336 --> 45:39.602
Hatred is just love.

45:39.604 --> 45:44.006
Hitler was just misunderstood.

45:44.008 --> 45:45.675
Dahmer's just a very hungry guy.

45:45.677 --> 45:48.544
- Ugh. Yeah, Jack the ripper
was just defending himself.

45:48.546 --> 45:51.714
- Pearl harbor's just a...

45:51.716 --> 45:53.349
Fuck.

45:54.518 --> 45:57.487
I didn't think that one through.

46:01.558 --> 46:05.595
- Your dad would've been
real proud of you today.

46:05.597 --> 46:08.931
- You think?
- I know.

46:08.933 --> 46:11.501
Hey, you remember
when we were, like... 10, 11,

46:13.470 --> 46:17.073
and I slept over and, uh...

46:17.075 --> 46:19.442
We snuck out
and stole your dad's...

46:19.444 --> 46:22.044
No, your mom's whiskey
and cigarettes.

46:22.046 --> 46:24.514
- It was rum.
It was definitely rum.

46:24.516 --> 46:26.749
- And your mom and dad
had that huge blowout fight.

46:26.751 --> 46:29.185
In that window right over there.

46:29.187 --> 46:31.187
- That wasn't a fight as much
as her throwing him around.

46:31.189 --> 46:34.190
- And she threw him up against
the glass out of nowhere.

46:34.192 --> 46:37.727
Scared the shit out of us.
We were laughing so hard.

46:37.729 --> 46:40.997
We were hiding in the bushes.

46:40.999 --> 46:43.533
Fuck. Why was that so funny
at the time?

46:43.535 --> 46:46.736
- I don't know.

46:46.738 --> 46:49.405
Maybe 'cause we... like,
really understood it, ya know?

46:49.407 --> 46:53.376
- What do you mean?

46:53.378 --> 46:55.211
- Like, like...
When you're a kid,

46:55.213 --> 46:58.080
everything that was so important
is just so, so trivial now,

46:58.082 --> 47:01.150
and vice versa.
- Mm-hmm.

47:01.152 --> 47:02.618
- Like two people that happen
to be my parents

47:02.620 --> 47:05.755
were just...
Fighting each other,

47:05.757 --> 47:07.690
just throwing each other around.

47:07.692 --> 47:09.458
That's... that's a funny thing
to watch when you're a kid.

47:09.460 --> 47:13.462
Then you get older,

47:13.464 --> 47:15.765
and you realize
that that shit is in you.

47:15.767 --> 47:19.235
That your parents... are you.

47:19.237 --> 47:21.437
And all that bitterness...

47:24.608 --> 47:27.410
I'm... really stoned.

47:31.549 --> 47:33.916
- Tell me something.

47:34.418 --> 47:36.118
You feel like dancing?

47:38.322 --> 47:39.422
- You know what?

47:40.457 --> 47:41.858
I think I do.

48:55.933 --> 48:57.333
- Hey, man.

48:58.902 --> 49:00.569
Fancy meeting you here.

49:00.571 --> 49:04.640
- Great, it's you.

49:04.642 --> 49:07.610
- Sven.

49:07.612 --> 49:09.045
How ya doin', daddy?

49:13.917 --> 49:15.318
Uh...

49:15.320 --> 49:17.253
This is my best friend...

49:17.255 --> 49:18.255
Jack.

49:21.124 --> 49:23.059
- Best friend, huh?

49:23.061 --> 49:25.261
I thought his friend
was that dike over there.

49:28.665 --> 49:32.702
Strange.
Haven't seen you here before.

49:32.704 --> 49:34.103
- Well, I've been coming here
my whole life

49:34.105 --> 49:36.072
and I haven't seen you either.

49:36.074 --> 49:39.041
I guess that makes us
equally strange.

49:42.245 --> 49:44.080
- Let me see your hands.

49:45.048 --> 49:46.282
- No.

49:46.284 --> 49:49.719
- Well, Sven, he... reads palms.

49:49.721 --> 49:50.786
Like a witch.

49:50.788 --> 49:52.154
- Cool.

49:58.729 --> 50:00.930
- Now, this is very interesting.

50:00.932 --> 50:04.200
See, your heart line...

50:04.202 --> 50:07.536
Goes all the way up to here.

50:07.538 --> 50:11.173
But your head line...
Stops here.

50:13.877 --> 50:15.778
- What does that mean?

50:18.281 --> 50:20.549
- That means
you're already dead.

50:35.932 --> 50:37.266
- I'm sorry about that.

50:37.268 --> 50:40.603
- It's fine.
- No... it's not.

50:40.605 --> 50:43.939
People like Sven think
they have the right to use

50:43.941 --> 50:46.409
and abuse and manipulate

50:46.411 --> 50:50.279
even if they don't know how
or why they have that right.

50:52.783 --> 50:54.450
- May not know
the meaning of the word,

50:54.452 --> 50:57.553
but tonight
you pontificate very well.

51:00.357 --> 51:02.191
- Hey.

51:02.193 --> 51:04.260
I liked what you said today.

51:04.262 --> 51:07.863
At the celebration.

51:07.865 --> 51:11.233
- You were there?
- Sorry.

51:11.235 --> 51:12.668
Tried to stay as hidden
as I could.

51:12.670 --> 51:15.404
- How did you know about it?
- Your mom told me.

51:15.406 --> 51:18.174
Her and I speak all the time
since I moved in.

51:18.176 --> 51:22.545
- How long ago did you move in?
- A while ago.

51:23.914 --> 51:25.514
- You know my father?

51:25.516 --> 51:29.852
- Uh, we... met each other
a few times, in passing.

51:29.854 --> 51:31.921
To be honest, I don't think
he liked me very much.

51:31.923 --> 51:35.157
He'd only say a few words to me
every time we saw each other.

51:36.693 --> 51:39.829
But I'm not trying to say
that he was an ass or anything,

51:39.831 --> 51:42.631
or that I'm any less sorry...
- here we go with the sorries.

51:42.633 --> 51:44.934
- Hey. Come on. Hey.
Look, two for two, okay?

51:44.936 --> 51:50.039
You were an asshole before
and I was an asshole now.

51:50.041 --> 51:51.774
I don't know you,

51:51.776 --> 51:55.478
but for some reason,
I care about you,

51:55.480 --> 52:00.116
so can you sit down
and we can talk a little bit?

52:02.319 --> 52:03.886
- Fuck off, queer.

52:05.789 --> 52:08.257
- Jack. Jack!

52:10.862 --> 52:12.728
- Sorry.

52:12.730 --> 52:14.163
Sorry.

52:33.817 --> 52:35.217
Stop it.

52:35.219 --> 52:37.319
Come on, asshole.

52:42.125 --> 52:44.793
Shhh...

53:22.933 --> 53:24.366
Rusty.

53:24.368 --> 53:27.937
Mom hates that.

53:31.241 --> 53:33.008
Rusty, come on.

53:33.010 --> 53:35.778
Rusty?

53:43.186 --> 53:44.987
C'mere. C'mere.

53:44.989 --> 53:50.192
Shhh... c'mere.

53:50.194 --> 53:53.229
What the fuck
is wrong with you?!

53:53.231 --> 53:54.763
You hurt him!

56:49.539 --> 56:53.208
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

56:57.481 --> 57:00.015
No, no, no, no. No!
Stop, stop, stop! Stop!

57:00.017 --> 57:02.551
Stop, stop!
Please stop, stop, stop, stop!

57:02.553 --> 57:04.486
No, no, no, no, no!!!

58:21.698 --> 58:22.998
Jesus.
- Whew!

58:23.000 --> 58:26.568
- You scared me.
- Oh, you scared me.

58:26.570 --> 58:29.905
Ha... what are you doing up?

58:29.907 --> 58:32.808
- I wanted a glass of water.
What are you doing up?

58:34.143 --> 58:35.978
- I was hungry.

58:51.227 --> 58:53.195
Sweet dreams, good boy.

58:54.831 --> 58:56.565
- 'Night, mom.

59:22.892 --> 59:26.161
<i>- There he is.
There's my boy.</i>

59:26.163 --> 59:29.565
<i>My good little guy.</i>

59:31.935 --> 59:34.970
<i>Jack out of the box!</i>

59:37.640 --> 59:39.141
<i>See? You're smiling now.</i>

59:39.143 --> 59:41.476
It's not so bad to smile, is it?
<i>Huh?</i>

59:41.478 --> 59:45.447
<i>Once in awhile?</i>

59:45.449 --> 59:47.282
<i>Here's baby Jack,</i>

59:48.551 --> 59:50.419
<i>and here's baby Andy!</i>

59:50.421 --> 59:55.023
<i>Ah, my two little monsters.
My good little monsters, huh?</i>

59:55.025 --> 59:58.226
<i>Oh, man,
you are gonna fight and scream</i>

59:58.228 --> 01:00:00.963
<i>and give mommy and daddy
such a headache,</i>

01:00:00.965 --> 01:00:03.532
<i>but we're gonna love you.
Yes, we are.</i>

01:00:03.534 --> 01:00:06.134
<i>We're gonna love you forever.</i>

01:00:06.136 --> 01:00:08.937
<i>- I don't wanna!
- Jack? What's wrong?</i>

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:12.808
<i>Come on, now.</i>

01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:16.011
<i>Come on, Jack. Please!</i>

01:00:16.013 --> 01:00:17.646
<i>Stop crying!</i>

01:00:19.816 --> 01:00:22.017
<i>Oh... oh...</i>

01:00:24.287 --> 01:00:25.787
<i>Oh!</i>

01:00:27.458 --> 01:00:30.592
<i>Oh!!</i>

01:00:30.594 --> 01:00:32.928
<i>Oh!!</i>

01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:34.963
<i>Oh...!</i>

01:00:55.718 --> 01:00:58.820
- What the fuck? Fuck.
What the fuck?

01:00:58.822 --> 01:01:00.455
Um, what...

01:01:00.457 --> 01:01:02.357
Would you be?

01:01:02.359 --> 01:01:05.127
What would you be?
Um...

01:01:05.129 --> 01:01:08.597
Dad's social security.
Social security.

01:01:08.599 --> 01:01:12.968
8-2-7-2.

01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:14.703
Um...

01:01:14.705 --> 01:01:16.271
Dad's birthday?

01:01:16.273 --> 01:01:18.306
Dad's birthday...

01:01:18.308 --> 01:01:20.242
1956.

01:01:20.244 --> 01:01:24.212
Um... okay.

01:01:26.416 --> 01:01:28.250
My birthday.

01:01:28.252 --> 01:01:30.619
19...

01:01:30.621 --> 01:01:32.320
87.

01:01:35.291 --> 01:01:36.591
Ah... come on, Jack.

01:01:36.593 --> 01:01:38.527
Come on, Jack.

01:01:38.529 --> 01:01:42.464
Jack. Jack.

01:01:42.466 --> 01:01:43.932
Jack.

01:01:45.501 --> 01:01:46.735
J...

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:48.904
5.

01:01:50.306 --> 01:01:53.141
A... 2.

01:01:53.143 --> 01:01:55.777
C... 2.

01:01:56.612 --> 01:01:58.980
K...

01:01:58.982 --> 01:02:00.148
5.

01:02:57.774 --> 01:02:59.775
: Jack?

01:03:01.545 --> 01:03:05.380
Jack, are you okay up there?

01:03:05.382 --> 01:03:08.049
Jack, I just want to know
you're okay.

01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:14.256
<i>- And you don't...
Remember any of this?</i>

01:03:16.926 --> 01:03:19.027
Your mom and dad
never said anything?

01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:22.964
- No. Your mom never said
anything to you?

01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:25.500
- No. No, of course not.

01:03:25.502 --> 01:03:28.069
I... you...
I would've said something.

01:03:30.873 --> 01:03:33.542
- There's something else.

01:03:33.544 --> 01:03:35.210
- What?

01:03:35.212 --> 01:03:37.679
- With the briefcase.
There was...

01:03:37.681 --> 01:03:41.483
There's a videotape and, uh...

01:03:41.485 --> 01:03:42.517
- Tell me.

01:03:44.987 --> 01:03:46.988
- It was my mom... my dad...

01:03:48.357 --> 01:03:49.825
Me as a baby...

01:03:51.561 --> 01:03:54.362
and my twin brother.

01:03:54.364 --> 01:03:56.231
- But you don't...

01:03:56.233 --> 01:03:58.099
Have a brother.

01:03:58.101 --> 01:04:00.468
- I did on the tape.

01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:03.271
Andy.

01:04:03.273 --> 01:04:06.975
- Isn't that what you were...
Gonna name your kid?

01:04:09.946 --> 01:04:11.546
- Not anymore.

01:04:54.858 --> 01:04:57.192
-<i> Jack.</i>

01:04:57.194 --> 01:05:01.529
<i>Jack, my boy,
I hope you can hear me.</i>

01:05:01.531 --> 01:05:05.667
<i>You need to know I never
wanted this hurt for you.</i>

01:05:05.669 --> 01:05:09.037
<i>I... don't know
when you'll hear this.</i>

01:05:09.039 --> 01:05:10.772
<i>Maybe never.</i>

01:05:10.774 --> 01:05:14.342
<i>But if you are hearing it...</i>

01:05:14.344 --> 01:05:17.279
<i>it probably means
I'm already gone.</i>

01:05:18.814 --> 01:05:22.250
<i>You'll be a man soon.</i>

01:05:22.252 --> 01:05:24.519
<i>And a man
needs to know the truth.</i>

01:05:25.988 --> 01:05:27.656
<i>And the truth is...</i>

01:05:31.894 --> 01:05:34.162
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:05:34.164 --> 01:05:38.233
<i>Endlessly sorry.</i>

01:05:38.235 --> 01:05:40.468
<i>I've failed you.</i>

01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:44.873
<i>I've failed to protect you.</i>

01:05:44.875 --> 01:05:47.208
<i>My own baby boy.</i>

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:50.478
<i>My own flesh and blood.</i>

01:05:55.818 --> 01:05:58.019
<i>The devil is in you now.</i>

01:06:22.445 --> 01:06:26.715
- It's not real. It isn't real.
It's not real. It's not real.

01:06:26.717 --> 01:06:28.650
It's not real. It's not real.
It's not real.

01:06:30.886 --> 01:06:34.656
- You having a bad dream, baby?

01:06:34.658 --> 01:06:36.624
- What are you doing here?

01:06:36.626 --> 01:06:38.493
- I thought
we could have a little cuddle.

01:06:39.362 --> 01:06:42.263
Like we used to. With Andy.

01:06:45.101 --> 01:06:48.236
What are you doing?!
Oh! Ow!

01:06:48.238 --> 01:06:50.071
What are you doing?!

01:06:50.073 --> 01:06:53.641
You open the door,
you fucking sonofabitch!!

01:06:53.643 --> 01:06:55.744
You filthy sonofabitch!!

01:06:55.746 --> 01:06:59.080
- Go away! Go away! Ah!!!

01:07:40.423 --> 01:07:42.924
<i>Jack is not at his phone,
so please leave a message</i>

01:07:42.926 --> 01:07:45.360
<i>after the tone.
- Shit.</i>

01:07:45.362 --> 01:07:47.395
<i>- Jack is not at his...
- Hey, um...</i>

01:07:47.397 --> 01:07:49.030
It's me.

01:07:49.032 --> 01:07:52.434
I was just, uh...

01:07:52.436 --> 01:07:55.537
I don't know, whatever, just...
Just call me back, okay?

01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:02.911
- Hey.

01:08:02.913 --> 01:08:08.316
You're shaking. What's wrong?
- Nothing. I just...

01:08:08.318 --> 01:08:11.052
- You worry too much about him.

01:08:11.054 --> 01:08:12.887
Jack will be fine.

01:08:12.889 --> 01:08:17.358
- Look, I know he's a hard-ass
and he's been a dick to you,

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:20.828
but trust me, he breaks.

01:08:20.831 --> 01:08:24.899
When I came out,
he was there, when...

01:08:24.901 --> 01:08:26.167
When my mom died, he was there.

01:08:26.169 --> 01:08:27.435
He's always there.
Now, I have to be...

01:08:27.437 --> 01:08:29.203
- shhh.

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:35.743
Well...

01:08:35.745 --> 01:08:38.145
go.

01:08:39.247 --> 01:08:40.881
- Something really bad...

01:08:40.884 --> 01:08:42.850
Is happening.

01:08:44.252 --> 01:08:46.720
- So when's your boyfriend
get back?

01:08:46.723 --> 01:08:50.859
- Six days.

01:08:50.861 --> 01:08:52.493
- Nice.

01:08:53.662 --> 01:08:57.031
- Hey, you okay?
You don't seem okay.

01:08:57.033 --> 01:09:00.068
- I'm fine.

01:09:00.069 --> 01:09:01.836
What?

01:09:01.837 --> 01:09:04.772
- Definition of not being fine
when someone says, "I'm fine."

01:09:04.774 --> 01:09:06.640
- Said I'm fine and I meant it.
- Oh, yeah?

01:09:06.643 --> 01:09:09.243
What about all that screaming
I heard last night, huh?

01:09:09.246 --> 01:09:13.180
You know I'm your neighbor.
It's kinda hard to bullshit me.

01:09:13.183 --> 01:09:14.649
Okay, just stop.

01:09:14.651 --> 01:09:22.323
Let the dog go for a second
and just talk to me.

01:09:22.325 --> 01:09:25.460
- You don't... know me.

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:29.596
- Is that a question
or a statement?

01:09:31.634 --> 01:09:34.469
- Neither.

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:36.638
Pretending that I'm talking
to myself,

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:38.706
'cause that's the only way
I can accept the words

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:40.207
I want to say out loud.

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:45.246
- Okay.

01:09:45.247 --> 01:09:47.849
I'm Jack.

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:52.520
Now, say whatever Jack
wants to say to Jack.

01:09:59.295 --> 01:10:01.796
I'm... Jack.

01:10:03.065 --> 01:10:06.467
Tell me what you think of Jack.

01:10:13.943 --> 01:10:15.877
- I hate you, Jack.

01:10:18.614 --> 01:10:21.216
I hate your family, Jack.

01:10:23.719 --> 01:10:25.853
Your lying mother.

01:10:25.855 --> 01:10:27.288
Your bastard father.

01:10:30.459 --> 01:10:32.493
It's pathetic.

01:10:32.495 --> 01:10:34.162
The only thing
that could open your eyes

01:10:34.164 --> 01:10:39.000
was the death of everything
you trusted and believed in.

01:10:39.002 --> 01:10:40.702
Your whole world.

01:10:43.339 --> 01:10:45.807
A world that would be better off
without you in it.

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:15.737
I have to go.

01:11:16.972 --> 01:11:20.475
Where's my...? Rusty?!

01:11:23.246 --> 01:11:25.280
- Hey, whatever's going on,

01:11:25.282 --> 01:11:27.348
you mustn't say
things like that.

01:11:43.632 --> 01:11:47.068
- Where the hell have you been?

01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:49.804
Jack? It's 1:00
in the fucking morning.

01:11:49.806 --> 01:11:52.640
- What do you care?
- What do I care?

01:11:52.642 --> 01:11:57.845
I care about the broken windows.
What the hell did you do?

01:11:59.248 --> 01:12:02.116
What did you do?

01:12:02.118 --> 01:12:05.320
Jack, I'm talking to you!
What did you do about...

01:12:05.322 --> 01:12:07.922
- what did I do?

01:12:07.924 --> 01:12:09.057
What did you do?

01:12:10.859 --> 01:12:13.461
What did you do?

01:12:13.463 --> 01:12:15.930
You... you don't remember?

01:12:15.932 --> 01:12:18.766
You don't remember
slapping dad around?

01:12:18.768 --> 01:12:20.668
You don't remember
pushing him around?

01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:22.036
Hmm?

01:12:22.038 --> 01:12:25.173
How does that feel?
Does that feel good?

01:12:25.175 --> 01:12:27.141
Does that feel good to you?

01:12:27.143 --> 01:12:29.410
'Cause that doesn't feel good
to me.

01:12:29.412 --> 01:12:31.446
Because I'm a good person.

01:12:31.448 --> 01:12:33.614
I'm a good person,
you fucking idiot.

01:12:33.616 --> 01:12:36.384
Getting into bed with me -
what the fuck is wrong with you?

01:12:36.386 --> 01:12:39.687
Jesus.
- What are you talking about?

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:44.125
- I have to go call my fiancée
and check on my baby.

01:12:45.994 --> 01:12:48.463
That's right, mom.
I'm having a child.

01:12:49.898 --> 01:12:53.067
Can't wait to fuck him up
like you fucked me up.

01:12:57.106 --> 01:12:58.639
- Oh, my...

01:13:15.759 --> 01:13:20.094
- <i>Hi.</i>
- Hello.

01:13:20.096 --> 01:13:22.430
Hi.

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:25.566
-<i> You okay? You seem upset.</i>

01:13:27.603 --> 01:13:30.538
- Uh, I'm... I'm... I'm fine.

01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:32.540
I'm fucking great, actually.

01:13:36.378 --> 01:13:37.879
-<i> So how is everything?</i>

01:13:37.881 --> 01:13:39.647
- You told me to call you
as soon as possible.

01:13:39.649 --> 01:13:41.609
Now you're gonna ask me
about the fucking weather.

01:13:43.152 --> 01:13:45.353
-<i> I'm sorry.</i>

01:13:45.355 --> 01:13:47.288
<i>Is this actually Jack Thurlow?</i>

01:13:47.290 --> 01:13:49.590
<i>Because the Jack Thurlow I know</i>

01:13:49.592 --> 01:13:51.959
<i>would never speak to me
that way.</i>

01:13:51.961 --> 01:13:54.862
- I'm sorry.

01:13:54.864 --> 01:13:57.398
Really, I am.

01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:59.100
You look upset. What's wrong?

01:14:04.039 --> 01:14:05.807
Did she die?

01:14:05.809 --> 01:14:08.242
-<i> Who?</i>

01:14:08.244 --> 01:14:09.744
- Your grandmother.

01:14:17.987 --> 01:14:19.987
Is our baby dead?

01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:26.861
Our baby's dead.

01:14:26.863 --> 01:14:28.496
<i>- I went
to the doctor's appointment,</i>

01:14:28.498 --> 01:14:31.032
<i>just a routine checkup,
and everything was normal,</i>

01:14:31.034 --> 01:14:32.900
<i>and they don't know
what happened!</i>

01:14:32.902 --> 01:14:34.735
<i>They don't know anything!</i>

01:14:34.737 --> 01:14:38.606
<i>Just... something went wrong
and... oh!!</i>

01:14:38.608 --> 01:14:40.475
<i>I'm so sorry, Jack.</i>

01:14:40.477 --> 01:14:42.877
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

01:14:42.879 --> 01:14:47.515
<i>It just hurts so bad
and I need you! I need you!</i>

01:14:47.517 --> 01:14:49.517
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

01:14:53.722 --> 01:14:55.623
- Our baby's dead.

01:15:48.043 --> 01:15:49.844
Sit down.

01:15:52.281 --> 01:15:53.748
Tell me what this means.

01:15:56.785 --> 01:15:59.654
- Did you read all of it?
The whole report?

01:15:59.656 --> 01:16:02.123
- Yes.
- Then you already know.

01:16:03.425 --> 01:16:04.792
There's nothing more I can add,

01:16:04.794 --> 01:16:06.627
even if you hold a knife
to my throat.

01:16:06.629 --> 01:16:07.929
- Don't...

01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:12.867
- Go for it.

01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:16.938
- Tell me! Tell me who this is.

01:16:19.207 --> 01:16:23.511
Is it...? That's... that's me.

01:16:23.513 --> 01:16:28.583
- Your father and I were always
at the university, teaching.

01:16:30.018 --> 01:16:34.555
Not less than four nights
a week.

01:16:34.557 --> 01:16:38.092
Our neighbor
had a 19-year-old son.

01:16:38.094 --> 01:16:43.598
He needed money,
so he became your babysitter.

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:46.534
After a... a few months,

01:16:46.536 --> 01:16:48.135
we noticed
that you were vomiting

01:16:48.137 --> 01:16:51.606
almost every morning
after he had looked after you.

01:16:53.842 --> 01:16:56.711
He finally admitted to us
that he and his father...

01:16:57.746 --> 01:16:59.880
had been touching you.

01:17:02.352 --> 01:17:03.718
So we went to the police.

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:05.753
There was a... a trial,

01:17:05.755 --> 01:17:08.422
and they were punished.

01:17:08.424 --> 01:17:10.324
It's as simple as that.

01:17:13.362 --> 01:17:15.229
- How did I tell you?

01:17:17.766 --> 01:17:19.266
- One morning, you threw up,

01:17:19.268 --> 01:17:25.473
and daddy asked you
what was wrong and you s...

01:17:25.475 --> 01:17:28.376
You said he had put his peepee
in your mouth.

01:17:30.746 --> 01:17:32.680
That was all we needed to hear.

01:17:33.949 --> 01:17:37.385
And the therapist said
that after two years,

01:17:37.387 --> 01:17:39.687
it was a miracle that you had
forgotten everything,

01:17:39.689 --> 01:17:41.222
so we decided
that that was best.

01:17:41.224 --> 01:17:43.224
- What about Andy?

01:17:51.233 --> 01:17:53.334
- Andy.

01:17:55.338 --> 01:17:57.004
Andy's not in here.

01:17:58.473 --> 01:17:59.974
How did you find out about him?

01:17:59.976 --> 01:18:01.575
- Doesn't matter.
Answer the question.

01:18:01.577 --> 01:18:05.212
- Andy is your brother...
And he was born with you.

01:18:05.214 --> 01:18:06.280
He was your twin.

01:18:06.282 --> 01:18:10.251
And he got an infection
and he died.

01:18:10.253 --> 01:18:11.352
- Bullshit.

01:18:13.388 --> 01:18:14.789
Tell me!

01:18:18.026 --> 01:18:19.226
- Okay.

01:18:21.496 --> 01:18:24.432
You cried... so much.

01:18:26.234 --> 01:18:27.968
You cried and you cried
and you cried and you cried

01:18:27.970 --> 01:18:33.207
and you cried... and... Andy...

01:18:35.811 --> 01:18:37.878
was so full of smiles.

01:18:38.947 --> 01:18:42.183
He was so happy

01:18:42.185 --> 01:18:44.452
and...
- get... get to the point.

01:18:48.190 --> 01:18:49.390
- No.

01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:52.259
There is no point.

01:18:56.332 --> 01:18:58.399
I'm gonna go lie down.

01:19:02.404 --> 01:19:03.871
Oh!

01:19:05.173 --> 01:19:07.308
- Don't make me kill my mother.

01:19:08.677 --> 01:19:10.244
- That night,

01:19:10.246 --> 01:19:13.114
your father must have had
some kind of breakdown.

01:19:13.116 --> 01:19:16.283
He went from some kind a high
to a low.

01:19:16.285 --> 01:19:18.753
He couldn't take
your screaming anymore.

01:19:18.755 --> 01:19:20.588
Neither of us could.

01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:24.725
I... woke up and I heard
the water running in the bathtub

01:19:24.727 --> 01:19:26.794
and that is all I know.

01:19:29.364 --> 01:19:30.865
Alright.

01:19:30.867 --> 01:19:33.901
I saw the lights out
in your room.

01:19:33.903 --> 01:19:36.170
I stumbled to the tub

01:19:36.172 --> 01:19:41.909
and I saw your father
holding my baby under the tap.

01:19:41.911 --> 01:19:44.712
And I said to him: "Why?"

01:19:44.714 --> 01:19:47.314
And he smiled...

01:19:47.316 --> 01:19:51.986
And he said,
"Jack won't cry anymore.

01:19:51.988 --> 01:19:53.988
Now we can sleep."

01:19:55.257 --> 01:19:58.692
But I knew it was Andy
in that water.

01:19:58.694 --> 01:20:00.628
It was not you.

01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:02.096
And he knew it too,

01:20:02.098 --> 01:20:03.964
because 10 seconds later,

01:20:03.966 --> 01:20:07.001
you started to cry again.

01:20:07.003 --> 01:20:09.203
It was supposed to be you, Jack!

01:20:09.205 --> 01:20:13.040
It was supposed to be you!
It was not supposed to be Andy!

01:20:13.042 --> 01:20:15.943
It was supposed to be you!!

01:20:23.552 --> 01:20:25.386
It was your father.

01:20:29.457 --> 01:20:31.559
And I have a question for you.

01:20:32.894 --> 01:20:36.096
Why, after all the things
I sheltered you from,

01:20:36.098 --> 01:20:39.266
have I become the devil
and he's god?

01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:56.383
- Hey!

01:20:56.385 --> 01:20:58.853
You okay?

01:20:58.855 --> 01:21:01.589
- No.

01:21:01.591 --> 01:21:03.657
She's lying.

01:21:03.659 --> 01:21:05.426
She's lying!

01:21:05.428 --> 01:21:07.528
She wants to make me insane.
I'm not.

01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:10.397
She wants to make me insane.
I'm not insane!

01:21:10.399 --> 01:21:13.934
He would never do that sh...
He would never do that.

01:21:13.936 --> 01:21:17.605
Never.
She's just... she's just...

01:21:17.607 --> 01:21:19.006
Fucking bitch.

01:21:31.786 --> 01:21:33.621
What the...? No. No.

01:21:40.161 --> 01:21:42.696
: Help. Help!

01:21:42.698 --> 01:21:44.765
Help!

01:21:44.767 --> 01:21:46.300
Help!

01:21:53.475 --> 01:21:55.643
- I will, Jack. I will.

01:22:10.959 --> 01:22:13.160
I'll help you, Jack.

01:22:15.864 --> 01:22:17.398
Just...

01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:19.199
Be a good boy.

01:22:34.215 --> 01:22:36.684
That's it. Just breathe.

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:39.954
Be a good boy.

01:23:34.342 --> 01:23:35.776
Hi.

01:23:39.814 --> 01:23:41.548
- She's back.

01:23:57.699 --> 01:23:59.099
- No.

01:24:09.744 --> 01:24:11.445
- Jack?

01:24:13.248 --> 01:24:15.449
Jack, I'm coming in.

01:24:27.796 --> 01:24:29.296
Jack?

01:24:54.022 --> 01:24:55.622
Jack! Fuck!

01:24:57.893 --> 01:25:01.895
- Sh... She killed him.

01:25:01.897 --> 01:25:06.033
- Here, let me just, um...
Jack, co...

01:25:06.035 --> 01:25:07.101
- what?

01:25:07.103 --> 01:25:09.736
Mine!

01:25:09.738 --> 01:25:11.205
Mine.

01:25:11.207 --> 01:25:15.476
Don't fucking touch him.

01:25:15.478 --> 01:25:17.010
- Ahem...

01:25:17.012 --> 01:25:18.846
Look, I'm just trying...

01:25:18.848 --> 01:25:21.215
- what? What? Trying to what?

01:25:21.217 --> 01:25:24.151
Trying to what?

01:25:24.153 --> 01:25:25.819
Trying to what?!!

01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:28.922
Are... you trying to help?

01:25:28.924 --> 01:25:31.558
Are you helping?
Are-are-wh-wh... I'm sorry?

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:34.928
Is that what you're gonna say?
I'm sorry?

01:25:34.930 --> 01:25:38.966
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:25:38.968 --> 01:25:41.535
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

01:25:41.537 --> 01:25:44.104
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:25:44.106 --> 01:25:46.273
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Who...

01:25:46.275 --> 01:25:47.841
Are you?
- I'm your best friend, Jack.

01:25:47.843 --> 01:25:49.543
- You're my best friend!
- I'm your best friend!!!

01:25:49.545 --> 01:25:56.750
- My best friend!
Are you gonna f-f-fix anything?

01:25:56.752 --> 01:26:00.254
You gon...
You gonna make me laugh?

01:26:00.256 --> 01:26:02.956
G-get me stoned?
You gonna tell me...

01:26:02.958 --> 01:26:04.525
Fucking jokes?

01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:09.363
I don't need help. I'm...

01:26:09.365 --> 01:26:11.265
Fixing things.

01:26:11.267 --> 01:26:15.102
I don't need you.
I don't need you.

01:26:15.104 --> 01:26:17.804
Go away! Go away!

01:26:17.806 --> 01:26:20.807
Get out! Get out!!! Get out!

01:26:20.809 --> 01:26:22.843
Get the fuck out! Get out!

01:26:22.845 --> 01:26:24.545
Ah!!!

01:26:24.547 --> 01:26:28.048
<i>- Once upon a time,
there was a little boy,</i>

01:26:28.050 --> 01:26:30.817
<i>and he went to the woods
with his mother.</i>

01:26:30.819 --> 01:26:34.555
<i>They planned to pick berries
and flowers of color,</i>

01:26:34.557 --> 01:26:38.025
<i>but instead
the boy picked up his brother.</i>

01:26:38.027 --> 01:26:41.061
<i>His brother was shy
and so very mean</i>

01:26:41.063 --> 01:26:45.499
<i>and angered himself
at all that was seen.</i>

01:26:45.501 --> 01:26:49.002
<i>The angry, old brother,
he needed a friend.</i>

01:26:49.004 --> 01:26:50.404
<i>"Come with me...</i>

01:26:55.810 --> 01:26:58.145
- Hey.

01:26:58.147 --> 01:27:02.883
You know what you have to do.
Hmm?

01:27:23.972 --> 01:27:25.606
- Mom...

01:27:28.076 --> 01:27:29.710
I made you a drink.

01:27:39.387 --> 01:27:40.988
- Thank you, darling.

01:27:47.028 --> 01:27:48.829
- You wanna hear some music?

01:27:59.074 --> 01:28:00.607
Will you dance with me?

01:29:26.595 --> 01:29:29.162
Yes?
- Hello.

01:29:29.164 --> 01:29:31.031
You must be Jack.

01:29:31.033 --> 01:29:32.599
- Yes, I... I must be.

01:29:32.601 --> 01:29:35.969
- I'm Linda Fletcher.
I live four houses down that way

01:29:35.971 --> 01:29:38.004
and I just...
- what do... what do you want?

01:29:38.006 --> 01:29:43.710
- Well, I-i just wanted to say
I'm so sorry about the accident

01:29:43.712 --> 01:29:45.545
and that I couldn't be here
for the funeral.

01:29:45.547 --> 01:29:47.047
I had planned to be,

01:29:47.049 --> 01:29:49.015
but my daughter just had
her first child in Phoenix,

01:29:49.017 --> 01:29:51.785
so I just got back...
- congratulations to her.

01:29:51.787 --> 01:29:55.055
And to you, being a grandmother.
Wish you luck and lots of it.

01:29:55.057 --> 01:29:57.457
Are those flowers for us?
Is that why you're here?

01:29:57.459 --> 01:29:59.226
- Yes. I just wanted to send
my sympathies.

01:29:59.228 --> 01:30:01.194
I can't imagine
what you must be going through.

01:30:01.196 --> 01:30:04.164
- Sunflowers.
That's my mom's favorite.

01:30:04.166 --> 01:30:06.333
- Yes, I know.

01:30:06.335 --> 01:30:09.169
- I'll be sure she gets them.
Is there anything else?

01:30:09.171 --> 01:30:12.038
- Um... no.

01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:13.473
Just, um...

01:30:15.243 --> 01:30:16.610
let me know

01:30:16.612 --> 01:30:19.780
if there's anything
I can do to help.

01:30:19.782 --> 01:30:21.615
- Will do.

01:30:21.617 --> 01:30:23.483
Thank you and good night, Linda.

01:32:21.168 --> 01:32:23.203
Shhh...

01:32:24.438 --> 01:32:26.306
Don't worry. Be there soon.

01:32:29.577 --> 01:32:31.311
Ah!!!

01:32:49.664 --> 01:32:51.665
We're here.

01:33:05.112 --> 01:33:06.613
You see that, mom?

01:33:09.517 --> 01:33:13.887
See... the tire tracks
at the edge of the cement there?

01:33:13.889 --> 01:33:17.223
Even through the rain,
there they'll be.

01:33:17.225 --> 01:33:21.595
Even through the snow,
there they'll stay.

01:33:21.597 --> 01:33:24.664
That wind will become rain.

01:33:24.666 --> 01:33:26.766
That rain will become snow.

01:33:26.768 --> 01:33:28.101
That snow will become ice

01:33:28.103 --> 01:33:30.337
and that ice will melt back
to the sky.

01:33:37.378 --> 01:33:39.012
You belong here.

01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:44.751
So do I.

01:33:44.753 --> 01:33:48.288
- Yes... just take us home...
Jack.

01:33:51.425 --> 01:33:52.759
- We are home.

01:33:56.030 --> 01:33:58.131
- Ah! Ow!

01:33:59.467 --> 01:34:01.635
Ugh! Ah!

01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:04.671
Ow!

01:34:06.508 --> 01:34:08.274
Jack!

01:34:08.276 --> 01:34:10.143
Please! Ah!

01:34:15.716 --> 01:34:18.685
No! No! No! Stop!

01:34:18.687 --> 01:34:21.588
Help!!! No!!!

01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:24.057
No!!!

01:34:26.328 --> 01:34:27.794
Oh, my god!

01:34:31.432 --> 01:34:33.133
Why are you smiling?

01:34:34.268 --> 01:34:35.335
Don't smile!

01:34:43.110 --> 01:34:45.945
- Wh-what-what are you doing?

01:34:48.416 --> 01:34:50.750
- What are you doing, Jack?

01:34:53.688 --> 01:34:55.355
- He had to go.

01:34:56.724 --> 01:34:58.358
So... so did she.

01:35:00.394 --> 01:35:02.962
So do I.

01:35:02.964 --> 01:35:05.765
- You're right.
He did have to go.

01:35:05.767 --> 01:35:08.968
And so did she.

01:35:08.970 --> 01:35:10.603
Open your eyes, Jack.

01:35:10.605 --> 01:35:13.773
Where is she?

01:35:24.518 --> 01:35:27.687
The accident?

01:35:27.689 --> 01:35:29.489
They both died.

01:35:31.992 --> 01:35:33.393
First I didn't realize

01:35:33.395 --> 01:35:35.762
why you just kept talking
about your dad.

01:35:37.465 --> 01:35:39.833
But then I realized.

01:35:39.835 --> 01:35:42.469
You couldn't let them both go
at once.

01:35:45.406 --> 01:35:48.208
Please put the knife...
Put the knife down.

01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:44.030
Hey.

01:36:44.832 --> 01:36:48.301
We're here.

01:36:58.445 --> 01:37:00.013
- I'm sorry.

01:37:01.582 --> 01:37:03.149
- For what?

01:37:04.652 --> 01:37:06.252
- Everything.

01:37:07.621 --> 01:37:09.956
- You can say it.

01:37:09.958 --> 01:37:11.558
You can hear it.

01:37:14.829 --> 01:37:16.496
I'm sorry.

01:37:24.905 --> 01:37:26.506
What?

01:38:10.618 --> 01:38:11.918
What is that?

01:38:14.421 --> 01:38:17.523
- Mom.

01:38:17.525 --> 01:38:18.625
Can you hear?

01:38:24.798 --> 01:38:26.666
I have to go inside now.

01:38:29.937 --> 01:38:32.005
I don't want
to keep her waiting.

01:38:39.380 --> 01:38:40.480
- Jack!

01:39:16.417 --> 01:39:18.518
-<i> Sweet dreams, good boy.</i>
