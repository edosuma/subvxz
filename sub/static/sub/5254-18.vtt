00:00.148 --> 00:01.101
<i>Previously on "Faking It"...</i>

00:01.136 --> 00:03.160
Prom will now be
mandatory.

00:03.195 --> 00:04.809
[bleep], now I have to go
to prom with Karma.

00:04.844 --> 00:05.937
This is a disaster.

00:05.971 --> 00:07.878
- Why don't we go together?
- Yeah, let's do it.

00:07.913 --> 00:09.403
No way you're going to prom
with your ex-boyfriend.

00:09.438 --> 00:11.161
It's not like it'd be
a real date.

00:11.196 --> 00:12.857
- Uh...
- Liam, you've grown.

00:12.892 --> 00:15.027
I'm gonna ask my crush
to prom myself.

00:15.062 --> 00:16.800
- Same here!
- There he is right now.

00:16.835 --> 00:18.199
What if we all went
to prom together?

00:18.234 --> 00:19.833
- I'm in.
- Thruple date.

00:22.280 --> 00:23.793
Well, well, if it isn't
the third wheel

00:23.828 --> 00:25.417
on my prom date
tricycle.

00:25.452 --> 00:27.672
I think Wade would call it
more of a bicycle.

00:27.740 --> 00:30.047
You're just the training wheels
ready to come off at any moment.

00:30.082 --> 00:31.579
Well, if anything,
I'm about gonna come on,

00:31.614 --> 00:33.130
blasting Wade so hard
with my A-game,

00:33.165 --> 00:34.879
he won't even remember
the name Loser.

00:34.947 --> 00:36.708
Oh, I'm sorry.
I meant Karma.

00:36.786 --> 00:38.709
Listen here, you little sh...

00:38.744 --> 00:40.761
...ane, it's Wade.
Hi.

00:40.796 --> 00:42.186
Hey, I didn't mean
to interrupt.

00:42.254 --> 00:43.835
- Nothing to interrupt.
- No, not at all.

00:43.870 --> 00:45.439
Maybe this thruple date
isn't such a good idea

00:45.486 --> 00:47.013
if it's gonna cause problems
between you two.

00:47.048 --> 00:49.128
Problems?
There are no problems.

00:49.163 --> 00:50.828
This is just
our bicker-y banter.

00:50.895 --> 00:52.236
We don't always see
eye to eye.

00:52.271 --> 00:55.208
Yeah, but opposites attract,
like we learned in chemistry.

00:55.243 --> 00:56.994
And from Paula Abdul.

00:57.029 --> 00:58.669
So you guys are...
you're cool with each other?

00:58.716 --> 01:02.206
Oh, cooler than cool.
We are really close.

01:02.274 --> 01:04.474
So close, in fact,
we've kissed,

01:04.543 --> 01:06.672
because I'm attracted
to girls sometimes too.

01:06.707 --> 01:09.077
Me too.
I have kissed girls.

01:09.112 --> 01:09.963
One girl, singular.

01:09.998 --> 01:12.215
But, like, a bunch of times.
[chuckles]

01:12.283 --> 01:13.916
So tomorrow night's a go?

01:13.984 --> 01:16.386
- Can't wait.
- Absolutely.

01:16.421 --> 01:19.288

01:19.323 --> 01:21.239
Is this a joke?
How does anyone ever

01:21.274 --> 01:23.546
get these things
to stay up?

01:23.581 --> 01:24.903
Boob tape
and good fortune.

01:24.963 --> 01:26.564
Ugh.
Can we be done with this?

01:26.601 --> 01:29.353
We're finding you the perfect
dress for your big date.

01:29.399 --> 01:30.666
It's not a date.

01:30.775 --> 01:33.017
No more calling it that,
especially around my mother.

01:33.052 --> 01:35.428
So she doesn't know
you're going with a boy?

01:35.569 --> 01:37.673
She can't know.
Her head might explode.

01:37.981 --> 01:39.556
Ooh, this looks like you.

01:39.806 --> 01:43.028
Actually,
I was thinking more...

01:43.063 --> 01:43.846
this.

01:43.981 --> 01:46.882
Holy nip slip, that V goes
all the way down to your V.

01:46.937 --> 01:48.116
I know.

01:48.184 --> 01:49.953
Shane can't compete
with this cleavage.

01:50.078 --> 01:52.006
Is that the only reason you're
doing this, to beat Shane?

01:52.041 --> 01:53.655
What?

01:53.756 --> 01:56.169
No, I-I really like Wade.

01:56.292 --> 01:58.860
I mean, he's cute
and funny and...

01:58.928 --> 02:02.197
Into girls and guys.
That doesn't bother you?

02:02.264 --> 02:04.733
O-M-G. Reagan,
I didn't realize you were here.

02:04.801 --> 02:06.304
Low blow.

02:06.382 --> 02:07.702
But, okay, point taken.

02:07.769 --> 02:09.470
Unlike your
close-minded ex-girlfriend,

02:09.538 --> 02:12.106
I'm totally cool if Wade wants
to swing both ways.

02:12.174 --> 02:13.949
In the course
of a single night?

02:13.984 --> 02:16.744
He's going out with you and
another guy at the same time.

02:16.812 --> 02:19.914
And, oh, yeah, that other guy
happens to be Shane...

02:19.981 --> 02:21.481
- your nemesis.
- Nemesis?

02:21.516 --> 02:22.650
- Uh-huh.
- Hardly.

02:22.718 --> 02:24.174
Karma's my nemesis.

02:24.213 --> 02:26.220
Let her push all she wants,
I'm not giving her an inch.

02:26.287 --> 02:27.922
All of Wade's inches
will be mine.

02:27.989 --> 02:29.849
Yeah, but Wade seems
to like Karma.

02:29.912 --> 02:31.831
He only thinks he likes her.
He's like a gay butterfly

02:31.866 --> 02:33.903
not yet sprung forth
from its cocoon.

02:33.958 --> 02:36.548
He's still, like,
10% bi-curious caterpillar,

02:36.634 --> 02:37.832
caught in transition.

02:37.899 --> 02:39.901
Right, 'cause guys
cannot be bi.

02:39.936 --> 02:41.924
Exactly.
Like Bigfoot.

02:42.089 --> 02:43.366
You know, there's a sighting
every now and then,

02:43.401 --> 02:44.948
but, like, no one has
real proof.

02:44.983 --> 02:46.570
You're doing that thing
where you say "like" a ton,

02:46.605 --> 02:48.475
which means you don't even
believe yourself.

02:48.543 --> 02:50.211
Okay, fine.
If you want me to let Karma

02:50.278 --> 02:52.454
have Wade all to herself
so that they bump and grind

02:52.489 --> 02:53.700
on the dance floor
and beyond...

02:53.735 --> 02:55.615
- No!
- Shh.

02:55.682 --> 02:56.718
Uh...
[chuckles]

02:56.765 --> 02:58.477
I mean, I can't really
tell you what to do.

02:58.524 --> 03:00.486
- But I can.
- Shh.

03:00.746 --> 03:02.824
Uh, excuse me,
I'm a substitute teacher here.

03:02.859 --> 03:04.096
These stupid rules
don't apply to me.

03:04.131 --> 03:05.538
You're lucky
I don't write you up.

03:05.573 --> 03:08.027
I hope I'm half as cool
when I'm old like you.

03:08.095 --> 03:10.369
Got to make a run for econ.
Bye, Sash.

03:10.404 --> 03:12.498
It's only six years,
skid mark.

03:12.796 --> 03:14.633
So is this where you tell me
that I've been

03:14.701 --> 03:16.797
a naughty schoolboy
and you need to discipline me?

03:16.832 --> 03:18.343
What the hell are you
babbling about?

03:18.378 --> 03:20.337
Your unrelenting mission
to seduce me?

03:20.372 --> 03:23.075
[chuckles]
I'm sorry, what?

03:23.142 --> 03:24.789
Maybe in Little Liam's
12-year-old

03:24.824 --> 03:26.694
choke-your-chicken-
to-my-school-photo dreams.

03:26.729 --> 03:28.890
That was just the one time.
And wait a second...

03:28.925 --> 03:30.100
just the other day,
you told me

03:30.135 --> 03:32.347
that you wanted to teach me
a thing or two.

03:32.425 --> 03:33.886
Yeah, in history class.

03:33.954 --> 03:35.378
You licked my ear.

03:35.413 --> 03:36.785
I lick plenty of ears.

03:36.820 --> 03:38.060
It was a joke.
I'm funny like that.

03:38.095 --> 03:39.657
So that's how you
want to play it?

03:39.693 --> 03:42.527
Liam, games are for children,
like you.

03:45.197 --> 03:47.474
[sighs] Theo, you have to come up
with new excuses,

03:47.509 --> 03:48.979
or else people are
going to figure us out.

03:49.041 --> 03:51.534
Five minutes?
What happened to the usual ten?

03:51.573 --> 03:53.250
It's prom week.
I can really only spare five.

03:53.285 --> 03:54.939
So start talking.

03:55.007 --> 03:56.635
Lauren, I know you
said yes to Tommy

03:56.670 --> 03:58.275
because you're mad at me,

03:58.343 --> 04:00.378
so stop avoiding me
and let's talk about this.

04:00.445 --> 04:02.546
Look, Tommy
is a necessary evil,

04:02.581 --> 04:03.826
and I haven't been
avoiding you.

04:03.861 --> 04:05.165
I'm just super busy
planning prom.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.134
It's just a party
in the gym.

04:07.295 --> 04:08.963
"A party in the gym"?

04:09.008 --> 04:11.276
Theo, prom is
a rite of passage

04:11.311 --> 04:13.513
forged through decades
of tradition.

04:13.558 --> 04:15.459
It's a night that every student
here will remember

04:15.548 --> 04:19.117
for the rest of their lives,
including me.

04:19.194 --> 04:22.263
Too bad I can't take
my boyfriend.

04:30.068 --> 04:33.070
(Lauren) Five, six, seven, eight.
One and two...

04:33.192 --> 04:35.307
Well, now I know being a surgeon
is out of the question.

04:35.342 --> 04:37.711
Shh.
Tommy needs to concentrate.

04:38.362 --> 04:39.129
- Oh!
- Ooh!

04:39.164 --> 04:40.285
Sorry, my bad.

04:40.338 --> 04:43.189
Of course it's your bad.
It's been your bad 17 times now.

04:43.224 --> 04:45.188
Forget it!
Thank God I am planning prom,

04:45.256 --> 04:47.413
because I know at least
it will be perfect,

04:47.448 --> 04:49.059
even though
my prom date won't.

04:49.126 --> 04:51.258
Now let's just go
up to my room.

04:51.380 --> 04:52.861
To make out?

04:52.929 --> 04:54.463
Gross.
No.

04:54.531 --> 04:56.850
To review my Pinterest board
of classic photo poses.

04:56.897 --> 05:00.078
That way, maybe you won't
screw up our prom pics.

05:02.631 --> 05:06.147
Look who I found out front
while I was pruning the roses...

05:06.182 --> 05:07.602
your prom date.

05:07.637 --> 05:09.430
Amy, why didn't you tell me

05:09.465 --> 05:12.900
that you were going to prom
with a... Felix?

05:12.935 --> 05:15.005
[laughs]
Oh, never mind.

05:15.040 --> 05:18.521
Um, I'll skedaddle
and let you two chat.

05:18.556 --> 05:21.239
And, Felix, you come early
for pictures tomorrow night,

05:21.306 --> 05:24.442
you hear?
No excuses.

05:24.510 --> 05:25.877
[mouthing words]

05:27.613 --> 05:30.635
With my exceptional powers
of deduction,

05:30.670 --> 05:33.970
I'm sensing you didn't want
your mother to know about us.

05:34.384 --> 05:36.930
Don't take it the wrong way.
It's just...

05:37.180 --> 05:40.196
I tried really hard to get her
to accept that I'm not straight,

05:40.253 --> 05:44.144
and now I'm sure she's in there
picking out our wedding china.

05:45.530 --> 05:47.077
If you don't mind me asking,

05:47.112 --> 05:50.433
if you're not straight,
then what are you?

05:50.468 --> 05:53.623
Allergic to peanuts...
and labels.

05:53.658 --> 05:55.297
[sighs]
I'm sorry.

05:55.332 --> 05:57.036
Hey, don't apologize.
We're teenagers.

05:57.071 --> 05:59.108
We're not supposed to have
all the answers, right?

05:59.176 --> 06:00.542
Now take my tuxes.

06:00.667 --> 06:01.944
I rented two
because I didn't know

06:02.012 --> 06:05.229
if we were going to be serious
or subversive.

06:05.264 --> 06:07.283
[sighs]
Me either.

06:07.350 --> 06:10.326
I bought a strapless dress,
so prepare yourself.

06:10.361 --> 06:12.649
I'm gonna be doing this
all night long.

06:12.684 --> 06:13.690
[both chuckle]

06:13.757 --> 06:14.844
It's so not me.

06:14.879 --> 06:16.541
Hey, you could wear
a burlap sack for all I care.

06:16.576 --> 06:18.194
Just be you.

06:18.261 --> 06:21.395
Tempting.
It might be too itchy.

06:21.442 --> 06:23.331
And...

06:23.399 --> 06:24.877
I like you in the blue.

06:24.916 --> 06:27.368
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

06:27.436 --> 06:29.838
- [camera shutter clicks]
- Oh, look at you!

06:29.906 --> 06:32.114
Hey, hey, hold on, now.
I'm trying to take a picture.

06:32.149 --> 06:35.243
Honey, I'm sensing
some passive aggression.

06:35.311 --> 06:37.004
You remember
what Dr. Phillips said.

06:37.039 --> 06:40.201
We communicate better
when we start with "I feel."

06:40.240 --> 06:43.225
I feel like Dr. Phillips
is full of horse [bleep].

06:43.260 --> 06:45.511
Okay, photo sesh over.

06:45.546 --> 06:47.021
Try not to murder-suicide
each other.

06:47.089 --> 06:49.471
That is not how I want
to remember prom night.

06:49.506 --> 06:51.058
All right,
limo's waiting outside...

06:51.126 --> 06:52.839
White,
just like you wanted.

06:52.874 --> 06:55.041
So?
You want an award?

06:57.005 --> 07:01.441
Son, have you heard of something
called a Smith & Wesson?

07:02.470 --> 07:05.021
How you doing, hon?
You know girls.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.875
They have to get the dress
just perfect.

07:08.099 --> 07:11.167
Oh, can I get you
some more sweet tea?

07:11.865 --> 07:13.132
Wow.

07:13.201 --> 07:18.105
Well, don't you look...
handsome.

07:18.588 --> 07:21.354
What?
Do I have a zit or something?

07:21.389 --> 07:24.658
Um, no.
No, you don't.

07:24.883 --> 07:27.123
All right, you two,
get together.

07:27.248 --> 07:29.263
[chuckles]

07:29.416 --> 07:31.651
- Assume the position.
- Ah.

07:33.366 --> 07:34.601
Just, let's...

07:34.712 --> 07:37.203
There we go.
Mm-hmm.

07:37.446 --> 07:38.472
[camera shutter clicks]

07:38.773 --> 07:41.341
Hey, let's try it
like this.

07:41.432 --> 07:44.701
[laughs]

07:44.746 --> 07:46.012
[camera shutter clicks]

07:46.132 --> 07:47.280
Let's get another one,
shall we?

07:47.424 --> 07:50.316
- Okay, how about this?
- [laughs]

07:50.532 --> 07:53.396
Can I have one normal one?

07:53.522 --> 07:54.854
Y'all just hold hands.

07:54.889 --> 07:58.825
- Okay.
- All right.

07:58.893 --> 08:00.127
- [camera shutter clicks]
- Aw.

08:00.162 --> 08:02.370
There,
was that so hard?

08:02.405 --> 08:04.700
[sighs]
Oh, y'all have fun tonight.

08:04.786 --> 08:08.678
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
[laughs]

08:08.713 --> 08:10.003
That doesn't limit
our options.

08:10.070 --> 08:11.721
- [laughs]
- Oh, this whole process

08:11.756 --> 08:13.673
would have been mortifying
without you.

08:13.708 --> 08:15.473
You're welcome.

08:15.623 --> 08:18.799
But, you know, you're...
you're still holding my hand.

08:18.945 --> 08:21.646
Oh.
S-sorry.

08:21.891 --> 08:23.591

Uh-oh, did I do
something wrong?

17:30.140 --> 17:31.387
Do you not like
what I did for you?

17:31.445 --> 17:33.342
No, it's lovely.

17:33.377 --> 17:34.832
Then why do you keep running
back out there

17:34.893 --> 17:37.453
when you could be here,
in this moment, with me?

17:37.585 --> 17:41.464
Because we only exist here,
in five minute increments

17:41.532 --> 17:42.721
so people don't get
suspicious.

17:42.798 --> 17:44.165
- Lauren...
- No.

17:44.232 --> 17:48.202
Out there, in the real prom,
I had the perfect dance,

17:48.404 --> 17:51.413
and it meant nothing
because it wasn't with you.

17:51.448 --> 17:53.640
We won't have to hide forever,
only until you graduate.

17:53.718 --> 17:55.004
That's over two years.

17:55.077 --> 17:56.520
In high school,
that's a lifetime.

17:56.607 --> 18:00.376
- You're just upset.
- No, Theo...

18:00.538 --> 18:03.451
I've spent my whole life
keeping big secrets,

18:03.486 --> 18:06.274
and just when I finally thought
I was finally free of them,

18:06.364 --> 18:08.131
you come along.

18:08.224 --> 18:11.955
And as much as I love you,
I can't do this anymore.

18:12.024 --> 18:13.725
Either we go public, or...

18:13.831 --> 18:18.034
You know I can't do that.
I'll lose my job.

18:23.013 --> 18:25.263
So... so what are you saying?

18:26.570 --> 18:32.113
This is it?
This is just... the end?

18:39.895 --> 18:43.597
All right, everybody, it's time
to announce the Prom King and Queen.

18:43.711 --> 18:46.218
Mary Lambert,
could you do the honors?

18:46.502 --> 18:48.328
The pig and the ficus.

18:48.363 --> 18:50.465
[cheers and applause]

18:50.532 --> 18:51.732
[both laughing]

18:53.001 --> 18:55.269
Seriously?
What's wrong with you people?

18:55.328 --> 18:56.807
Hey, so listen, I just
talked to my mom

18:56.842 --> 18:58.121
and I told her I'm staying
with you tonight,

18:58.181 --> 19:00.149
so if she calls, you can
cover for me, right?

19:00.248 --> 19:01.415
Because you'll be...

19:01.450 --> 19:03.651
At the hotel
having my threesome.

19:05.274 --> 19:07.415
I thought you said
that wasn't gonna happen.

19:07.450 --> 19:08.936
Yeah, and I thought you
said that you weren't

19:08.971 --> 19:10.817
gonna hurt Felix
by giving him hope,

19:10.885 --> 19:13.394
then I saw you two kissing.
What are you doing?

19:13.449 --> 19:14.857
What are <i>you</i> doing?

19:15.092 --> 19:17.129
You used to want prom
to be a magical night

19:17.234 --> 19:20.059
with your charming prince,
and now it's a three-way

19:20.125 --> 19:22.126
with two guys who are
into each other?

19:22.337 --> 19:25.630
Yeah, it is, and they're waiting
for me to get it on.

19:25.813 --> 19:27.180
I forbid you.

19:30.898 --> 19:32.387
You forbid me?

19:32.422 --> 19:33.004
Mm-hmm.

19:33.039 --> 19:36.116
What right do you have
to forbid anything?

19:36.457 --> 19:41.412
You get to be happy with Felix.
Liam gets to be happy.

19:41.494 --> 19:43.763
When is it my turn?

19:45.985 --> 19:50.822
Hey, are you okay?
That looked intense.

19:50.951 --> 19:52.751
- Can you take me home?
- Yeah.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.860
Shane.
Shane!

19:56.032 --> 19:57.056
Shane, do not do this,
or this is...

19:57.130 --> 20:00.565
Or what?
You'll bang my sister?

20:00.600 --> 20:05.237
♪ Wasting my time
and I'm feeling helpless ♪

20:05.823 --> 20:08.038
Whoa.

20:08.432 --> 20:09.966
Do you want to get
out of here?

20:15.306 --> 20:16.582
Last chance to open
the parachute

20:16.617 --> 20:17.893
before the clothes
start flying.

20:17.928 --> 20:19.831
Afraid you can't handle
what I've got under here?

20:19.866 --> 20:21.686
Maybe you'll faint and
I'll have Wade all to myself.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.006
(Wade) Hey, are y'all coming,
or did this threesome

20:23.041 --> 20:25.342
just become a one-some?

20:27.245 --> 20:28.086
Stay on your side.

20:28.121 --> 20:29.455
No eye contact.

20:29.668 --> 20:31.468
(both)
We keep the lights off.

<i>Next on "Faking It"...</i>

20:34.037 --> 20:35.595
The threesome happened,
and it was fun.

20:35.630 --> 20:36.971
(Shane) I can't be mad at you
for banging my sister

20:37.006 --> 20:39.274
when I was up all night
banging Karma.

20:39.309 --> 20:40.309
Oh.

20:41.673 --> 20:42.903
Hey, there, sexy.

20:42.938 --> 20:44.900
Hey, Lauren.
Forget your pants?

20:44.935 --> 20:46.146
We're not having a party.

20:46.181 --> 20:47.963
Apparently, you are. Thanks
for the invite, by the way.

20:47.998 --> 20:49.125
What are you doing?

20:49.160 --> 20:50.250
[garbled]
A body shot.

20:50.285 --> 20:52.343
We need to talk about Karma.
She's out of control.
