00:29.161 --> 00:34.167
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

00:52.317 --> 00:53.552
Thy Kingdom come...

00:57.155 --> 00:59.259
I will be done on Earth,

01:00.558 --> 01:02.227
as it is in heaven.

01:14.472 --> 01:16.643
And give us this day
our daily bread.

01:24.683 --> 01:28.121
Forgive us our debts,
as we forgive our debtors.

01:52.177 --> 01:53.311
Lead us not to temptation...

01:57.382 --> 01:59.284
but deliver us from evil.

02:11.697 --> 02:12.699
Amen.

02:47.299 --> 02:48.168
Mom?

02:48.933 --> 02:50.270
Dad?

03:10.923 --> 03:11.790
Mom?

03:46.324 --> 03:47.560
No! Mom!

03:48.661 --> 03:49.762
Dad!

03:50.729 --> 03:52.699
Help, help, please help!

05:13.778 --> 05:15.615
Jordan's coming home.

05:48.514 --> 05:50.447
<i>Jordan?</i>

05:50.449 --> 05:51.651
<i>Jordan, you need
to come home.</i>

05:57.588 --> 06:00.524
<i>Hey, this is Ashley,
leave a message.</i>

06:00.526 --> 06:01.892
Hey, Ash, it's Jordan,

06:01.894 --> 06:04.760
I just got a message
from Aunt Tanya.

06:04.762 --> 06:06.128
She said I need to come
home immediately?

06:06.130 --> 06:07.930
I'm really worried
about you guys,

06:07.932 --> 06:11.134
so please just call me back
as soon as you can.

06:11.136 --> 06:12.739
All right,
I'm on my way, bye.

06:55.613 --> 06:58.214
Well... that's it.

07:00.619 --> 07:02.519
Fine.
Why don't you head on over

07:02.521 --> 07:03.990
to Tanya's house now
and clean up?

07:04.990 --> 07:08.625
Oh, here's the number
and address

07:08.627 --> 07:10.760
of Jordan and Ashley's
father, like you asked.

07:10.762 --> 07:12.197
Well, I hope he believes me.

07:17.802 --> 07:19.771
May peace be with you,
Dr. Carraz.

07:21.740 --> 07:25.677
May peace be with you,
Pastor John Douglas.

07:32.016 --> 07:35.050
Yes, I understand, Mark,
but I need to know

07:35.052 --> 07:37.586
that you have the girls'
best interests at heart.

07:37.588 --> 07:40.156
If you can assure me of that,
I will do what I can.

07:40.158 --> 07:43.659
<i>Well, yes, sir, I can
assure you, most definitely.</i>

07:43.661 --> 07:45.130
- Great, I'll see you soon.
- <i>Okay.</i>

07:59.177 --> 08:01.911
I'm just really
worried about them.

08:01.913 --> 08:03.546
I've been texting
Ashley all morning

08:03.548 --> 08:05.081
and she hasn't gotten
back to me yet.

08:05.083 --> 08:06.882
<i>I'm sure everything
is fine, okay?</i>

08:06.884 --> 08:08.651
<i>Nothing is gonna
happen in this town</i>

08:08.653 --> 08:10.786
<i>without every person
knowing about it.</i>

08:10.788 --> 08:12.721
<i>Do you know where
you're staying?</i>

08:12.723 --> 08:16.760
I don't even know, maybe my Aunt
Tanya's house, I don't know.

08:16.762 --> 08:18.194
<i>I'm working at
the Lakeside Market</i>

08:18.196 --> 08:20.096
<i>in Flowery Ranch
tomorrow morning.</i>

08:20.098 --> 08:22.298
<i>You should come by and see me.</i>

08:22.300 --> 08:24.634
<i>In the meantime,
I'm gonna ask my brother and his friends</i>

08:24.636 --> 08:26.336
<i>if they know anything.</i>

08:26.338 --> 08:27.836
Okay, thank you.

08:27.838 --> 08:30.240
And, yeah, I'll just

08:30.242 --> 08:31.911
catch up with you
a little later, okay?

08:33.979 --> 08:35.578
<i>Bye.</i>

08:35.581 --> 08:36.249
Bye.

09:46.183 --> 09:48.151
You know, I don't know
if I'm more nervous

09:48.153 --> 09:50.022
or excited to see Jordan today.

09:51.322 --> 09:54.257
Either way, I really do appreciate
the olive-branch opportunity

09:54.259 --> 09:56.861
that both you and the Lord
have presented me with.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.996
I just, I wish that
I'd have reached out

09:59.998 --> 10:02.898
to Ash and Tanya a little earlier
to let them know we were home.

10:02.900 --> 10:05.701
Maybe we could have helped
out one way or another.

10:05.703 --> 10:08.003
Well, Dr. Carraz was insistent

10:08.005 --> 10:10.006
on taking them both out
of town for a while,

10:10.008 --> 10:12.709
it's a part of the process.

10:12.711 --> 10:13.913
He knows what he's doing.

10:15.714 --> 10:20.052
Anyway, I'm glad you're here,
girls need a father.

10:21.452 --> 10:24.055
Maybe it's time for you
and Jordan to make amends.

10:25.990 --> 10:28.193
How long's it been since
you seen your girls?

10:30.062 --> 10:31.864
Years.

10:33.030 --> 10:33.899
It's been years.

10:34.698 --> 10:36.368
Not for lack of trying,
of course.

10:37.802 --> 10:38.937
I miss 'em, a lot.

10:41.038 --> 10:43.842
God knows I have not been
the best father to the girls.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.179
That's why we're here though,

10:48.145 --> 10:49.848
make amends as best that I can.

10:51.182 --> 10:53.418
Things are different now,
I'm changed.

10:54.720 --> 10:59.258
I got clean, I found God,
found Karen, I've been saved.

11:01.426 --> 11:02.858
I just hope I have
the opportunity

11:02.860 --> 11:04.163
to show the girls both that.

11:07.065 --> 11:08.968
So how are you
and Karen settling in?

11:09.934 --> 11:12.035
Great.
Karen, she's keeping me busy

11:12.037 --> 11:13.936
with the upgrades
on the house, boy.

11:13.938 --> 11:15.939
Mm.

11:15.941 --> 11:17.473
I just wish that
I could get out

11:17.475 --> 11:19.745
and find myself some time
to get some paid work.

11:20.778 --> 11:23.213
You know, I'm a carpenter by trade,
I can do just about anything,

11:23.215 --> 11:25.350
if you know of anybody
who needs any help.

11:37.863 --> 11:40.296
Well, why don't you stop by
the office sometime next week,

11:40.298 --> 11:43.269
maybe I can see if I can
help you find some work.

11:44.402 --> 11:47.273
Reverend, I would appreciate
that, more than you know.

11:50.274 --> 11:51.177
Here we are.

12:05.056 --> 12:06.125
You know, uh...

12:09.326 --> 12:10.763
Ashley's like her mother.

12:12.129 --> 12:13.298
She's like her mother?

12:16.168 --> 12:17.903
She has some of the same traits.

12:22.908 --> 12:26.342
She said the key
would be under the mat.

12:26.344 --> 12:28.948
You said she has
the same traits?

12:30.048 --> 12:31.049
How do you mean?

12:36.321 --> 12:38.021
Ashley is experiencing

12:38.023 --> 12:40.556
some of the same things
as her mother did.

12:40.558 --> 12:42.090
Mental problems?

12:42.092 --> 12:43.526
I'm confused, Reverend.

12:46.898 --> 12:47.966
Jordan's here.

12:50.134 --> 12:51.937
Hey, what's going on?

12:53.504 --> 12:55.972
Is everything okay?
Did something bad happen?

12:55.974 --> 12:58.473
Jordan, do you remember me?
I'm Reverend Michael.

12:58.475 --> 13:01.344
Before she left, Tanya told me
that you'd be coming here.

13:01.346 --> 13:05.614
She asked me to come by
and help in any way I could,

13:05.616 --> 13:07.118
in case you were worried.

13:08.052 --> 13:09.853
So if she was worried,

13:09.855 --> 13:11.887
why isn't she
picking up my calls?

13:11.889 --> 13:15.925
Well, Ashley has been having
a few traumatic experiences.

13:15.927 --> 13:17.627
Tanya and Dr. Carraz decided

13:17.629 --> 13:19.429
to take her away
for a little while,

13:19.431 --> 13:20.597
but it's gonna be all right.

13:20.599 --> 13:21.631
So you're back?

13:21.633 --> 13:23.366
That's what I heard.

13:23.368 --> 13:25.300
Yes, your father
wanted to lend a hand,

13:25.302 --> 13:28.003
he's been worried
about Ashley, and you.

13:28.005 --> 13:29.939
We've been back a little while.

13:29.941 --> 13:32.941
We felt best just to let you
come back and us get settled

13:32.943 --> 13:35.246
before we called
and reached out, let you know.

13:37.448 --> 13:38.513
I need to get inside.

13:38.515 --> 13:39.985
No, let me go in first.

13:41.986 --> 13:42.855
Jordan.

14:04.241 --> 14:06.142
Under the church.

14:09.147 --> 14:10.246
You okay?

14:10.248 --> 14:11.850
- I'm sorry.
- I...

14:14.351 --> 14:16.588
I just... need to go.

14:17.422 --> 14:18.290
Jordan?

14:18.990 --> 14:20.091
Jordan?

14:22.293 --> 14:23.459
Jordan?

14:23.461 --> 14:24.330
Hey, Jordan?

14:25.530 --> 14:29.065
What is going on in there?
Why is her room so different?

14:29.067 --> 14:32.669
Well, I don't know, but I know they were
having trouble just before they left.

14:32.671 --> 14:34.874
Listen, Ashley
hasn't been herself.

14:35.572 --> 14:36.542
She, uh...

14:37.942 --> 14:39.644
I am not leaving
until I find her.

14:40.544 --> 14:42.512
That's understood.

14:42.514 --> 14:46.081
Hey, Jordan, Ashley,
Tanya, and the doc,

14:46.083 --> 14:47.983
they're gonna be back soon.

14:47.985 --> 14:49.451
You are welcome to come
and stay at the house,

14:49.453 --> 14:51.289
just until we get
to talk to 'em.

14:52.090 --> 14:54.093
Yeah, that might not
be a bad idea, dearie.

14:55.059 --> 14:55.994
Hmm?

14:58.062 --> 14:59.497
Just until we find her.

15:01.432 --> 15:02.400
Yeah.

15:03.368 --> 15:05.300
Yeah, this is great,
I'm gonna call Karen,

15:05.302 --> 15:06.602
just to let her know that...

15:06.604 --> 15:09.041
- Yeah.
- And, uh, listen,

15:10.008 --> 15:12.374
Here. It's my card.

15:12.376 --> 15:14.710
Call me, day or night,
if you need anything.

15:29.059 --> 15:31.060
We're gonna head out by
Old Mill Creek Road here

15:31.062 --> 15:31.931
and swing a right.

15:33.999 --> 15:36.265
About 15 miles down,
the farmhouse is going to be on the right,

15:36.267 --> 15:38.003
just past Dottie's old place.

15:39.738 --> 15:41.941
You're not gonna believe
how big Xander is now.

15:51.482 --> 15:54.416
Hey, um, I'm sorry that I

15:54.418 --> 15:56.989
didn't call
to let you know I was in town.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.391
It all just happened so quick.

16:00.725 --> 16:02.394
Everything happens for a reason.

16:04.294 --> 16:05.330
In God's time.

16:11.369 --> 16:15.537
I am not gonna tell you
both again, all right?

16:15.539 --> 16:18.376
I put you in here,
and I want no talking.

16:19.677 --> 16:21.143
And I don't want
you to think about

16:21.145 --> 16:22.744
leaving this fucking closet,

16:22.746 --> 16:24.549
do I make myself crystal clear?

16:29.086 --> 16:31.353
And don't make me come back one more
time, because if I do,

16:31.355 --> 16:32.789
I swear to God,
I'll grab that necklace

16:32.791 --> 16:35.260
around your fucking
neck so fast...

16:37.528 --> 16:40.032
Now cover your ears,
both of yous.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.540
When your mother passed away...

16:50.607 --> 16:52.210
that affected me in ways that...

16:54.111 --> 16:55.447
I couldn't explain.

16:57.481 --> 16:58.783
And I know I don't have to...

17:00.350 --> 17:02.388
You were there for that,
all of it.

17:04.721 --> 17:05.790
I'm sorry.

17:11.261 --> 17:12.498
You know, you may hate me...

17:15.165 --> 17:18.770
you have every right
to hate me...

17:22.707 --> 17:23.776
but if...

17:25.509 --> 17:29.644
if you could just somehow
find it in your heart

17:29.646 --> 17:32.681
to even think about trying
to let me back in again,

17:32.683 --> 17:35.383
I swear, as God is my witness,
I will do the best that I can

17:35.385 --> 17:37.120
to make it up to you
the rest of my life.

17:37.122 --> 17:40.459
I'm not gonna be here
long enough for all that.

17:41.593 --> 17:43.562
I'm only here to find Ashley.

18:05.482 --> 18:07.216
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too!

18:07.218 --> 18:09.254
Wow, you're almost
as tall as I am now.

18:11.155 --> 18:14.457
Jordan, we're so
glad to have you.

18:14.459 --> 18:16.491
Look at how much you've grown.

18:16.493 --> 18:20.830
You're so beautiful.
I made a bed for you upstairs.

18:20.832 --> 18:23.565
- Here, let me get your bag, we'll get you settled.
- I'll hang onto it.

18:23.567 --> 18:26.401
- Can I show Jordan her room?
- Yes, of course.

18:26.403 --> 18:29.572
- I'd love to see it.
- I think someone's excited you're here.

18:42.452 --> 18:43.355
This is your room.

18:44.454 --> 18:46.255
And my room's right there,

18:46.257 --> 18:48.190
so you can come crash
with me if you get scared.

18:48.192 --> 18:50.359
Thanks, Xander.

18:50.361 --> 18:52.495
Hey, honey, why don't you
go get ready for dinner?

18:52.497 --> 18:53.398
Okay, Mom.

18:54.199 --> 18:56.199
Make yourself at home.

18:56.201 --> 18:58.170
I put fresh towels
in the bathroom.

18:59.203 --> 19:01.871
You can stay for as
long as you'd like.

19:01.873 --> 19:02.939
Thanks, Karen.

19:04.808 --> 19:08.747
Jordan, I'd really like
for us to be good friends.

19:09.747 --> 19:13.285
And if you let me, I'd love
to make up for lost times.

19:15.653 --> 19:18.222
I just really need to find
my sister right now.

19:20.391 --> 19:22.557
Of course, of course.

19:22.559 --> 19:24.695
I can't imagine
what you're going through.

19:25.762 --> 19:29.567
I just want you to know that
you have family here for you,

19:30.567 --> 19:31.636
that I'm here for you.

19:32.637 --> 19:35.439
And if you need anything,
just let me know.

19:37.842 --> 19:38.710
I will.

19:39.943 --> 19:41.846
Well, I'm gonna
finish up dinner.

19:43.914 --> 19:45.581
Um, when you're done unpacking,

19:45.583 --> 19:47.719
can you grab Xander
and bring him down?

19:52.522 --> 19:55.259
It's really nice
to have you here.

20:15.046 --> 20:17.046
Are you crazy?

20:18.516 --> 20:19.782
No, I can't.

20:21.586 --> 20:23.486
- No.
- Xander?

20:23.488 --> 20:24.819
What's wrong with you?

20:24.821 --> 20:26.322
Xander?

20:26.324 --> 20:27.690
Who are you talking to?

20:27.692 --> 20:29.057
Is dinner ready?

20:29.059 --> 20:29.927
Yeah.

20:58.990 --> 21:01.990
No, I'm a great
singer, alright?

21:01.992 --> 21:05.327
Honey, this smells just amazing.

21:05.329 --> 21:07.997
Made my favorite.

21:07.999 --> 21:09.931
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

21:09.933 --> 21:11.901
Hey, Karen,
can I get anything for you?

21:11.903 --> 21:13.669
Yeah, why don't you go ahead
and take the mashed potatoes?

21:13.671 --> 21:15.770
- Okay.
- Hey, Mom, can I help you?

21:15.772 --> 21:18.007
Uh, yeah, go ahead and get
that lemonade for me.

21:18.009 --> 21:18.876
Okay.

21:20.377 --> 21:22.111
Oh, here you go, honey.

21:22.113 --> 21:23.546
- Oh.
- Okay, there you are.

21:23.548 --> 21:24.713
- Ooh!
- Oh, careful.

21:24.715 --> 21:26.414
Careful, careful.

21:30.855 --> 21:33.555
- Here you are, Jordan.
- Thank you.

21:38.863 --> 21:39.931
Nice.

21:49.606 --> 21:50.840
Okay.

21:50.842 --> 21:52.641
- Mmm.
- Here we go.

21:52.643 --> 21:54.410
- Wow.
- That smells delicious.

21:54.412 --> 21:55.844
- Mm-hmm.
- I hope you're hungry.

21:55.846 --> 21:57.145
- Honey, you outdid yourself.
- Yeah.

21:57.147 --> 21:58.814
Thank you
guys for dinner.

21:58.816 --> 21:59.985
You're welcome.

22:01.219 --> 22:04.423
- Mm, mm, mm.
- Xander, can you put your phone down?

22:05.655 --> 22:06.825
Hon, this is so good.

22:07.959 --> 22:09.624
- Glad you like it.
- You've outdone yourself.

22:11.095 --> 22:13.398
So, Jordan,
how are you liking college?

22:13.964 --> 22:16.798
It's good, real good.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.901
Do you have a major yet?

22:18.903 --> 22:21.103
Clinical psychology.

22:21.105 --> 22:21.972
Mm.

22:22.973 --> 22:24.576
Clinical psychology, huh?

22:26.611 --> 22:27.679
How'd you choose that?

22:28.645 --> 22:30.813
Guess I just wanted
to dive a little deeper

22:30.815 --> 22:33.418
into our family problems.

22:35.153 --> 22:38.520
Well, I know that you are
gonna do good at that major

22:38.522 --> 22:40.424
or anything else you
put your mind to.

22:42.125 --> 22:44.125
Put your phone away, son.

22:44.127 --> 22:48.130
Have you heard anything
regarding Tanya and Dr. Carraz

22:48.132 --> 22:50.102
and where they
might've took Ashley?

22:51.935 --> 22:53.739
No, nothing yet.

22:55.406 --> 22:58.710
Don't you think that's strange, that they
didn't tell anyone where they were going?

22:59.176 --> 23:00.811
It just doesn't make sense.

23:02.180 --> 23:05.046
Aunt Tanya left me a message this
morning telling me to come home.

23:05.048 --> 23:07.082
I've been trying
to reach them nonstop,

23:07.084 --> 23:09.421
and it just keeps
going to voicemail.

23:10.054 --> 23:12.121
You know, the reverend,

23:12.123 --> 23:14.457
he told me something today
that had me a little worried,

23:14.459 --> 23:16.158
he said that Ash is showing

23:16.160 --> 23:18.126
some similar signs
as her mother,

23:18.128 --> 23:20.631
as far as mental disabilities.

23:22.933 --> 23:23.835
I'm so sorry.

23:24.701 --> 23:26.501
Well, she hasn't been
diagnosed with

23:26.503 --> 23:28.639
mental illness, has she?

23:34.811 --> 23:37.746
My Aunt Susan was diagnosed
with a mental illness,

23:37.748 --> 23:41.182
it's really not that uncommon.

23:42.185 --> 23:43.621
I heard it's hereditary.

23:45.022 --> 23:47.189
Have you heard
that, Jordan, or read that, Jordan?

23:47.191 --> 23:48.556
Yeah.

24:07.845 --> 24:10.949
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

24:11.749 --> 24:13.818
I don't know what
came over me then.

24:15.586 --> 24:16.822
I lost my head.

24:18.823 --> 24:21.090
I'm honestly really tired,
it's been a long day,

24:21.092 --> 24:23.795
so I'm just going
to head on to bed.

24:24.261 --> 24:27.731
But, um, thank you so much
for the lovely dinner.

24:32.603 --> 24:35.039
You know you're not supposed
to have your phone at dinner.

24:36.273 --> 24:38.172
I'm sorry, Mom.

24:38.174 --> 24:39.708
We'll fix your phone.

24:39.710 --> 24:41.212
I'm gonna get
that fixed tomorrow.

24:42.179 --> 24:43.515
Okay?

24:44.214 --> 24:45.115
Hey.

24:47.250 --> 24:48.918
I'm sorry, son.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.188
It's okay.

24:51.188 --> 24:53.091
Xander, why don't you go up
and get ready for bed?

24:57.228 --> 24:58.497
Dang it.

25:12.676 --> 25:14.578
I know this isn't easy on you.

25:20.183 --> 25:21.252
It should be.

25:27.124 --> 25:28.927
I'm gonna go run
upstairs and talk to him.

25:30.961 --> 25:32.026
Okay?

25:32.028 --> 25:33.030
I'm sorry.

25:39.703 --> 25:43.040
Chief, I'm sorry I overreacted
at dinner like that.

25:44.008 --> 25:45.309
- It's okay, Dad.
- No.

25:46.309 --> 25:48.946
No, I let my emotions
get the best of me, and I,

25:49.980 --> 25:51.182
I acted out.

25:54.151 --> 25:55.019
I'm sorry.

25:56.086 --> 25:58.286
Sometimes when we do that,
it's real important that

25:58.288 --> 26:00.221
we find our loved ones

26:00.223 --> 26:02.226
and we make good,
soon as we can.

26:03.394 --> 26:05.163
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

26:06.297 --> 26:07.632
I'm sorry.

26:08.699 --> 26:09.634
It's okay.

26:11.836 --> 26:13.137
Let's say a prayer.

26:23.948 --> 26:27.819
Dear Father God, thank you so much
for being with us today and tonight.

26:28.919 --> 26:32.657
We pray that you will lead us
as we sleep and we dream.

26:33.223 --> 26:35.961
May you greet us
in the morning, in a new day.

26:36.394 --> 26:38.596
- Amen.
- Amen.

26:43.800 --> 26:45.002
There you go.

26:51.942 --> 26:54.709
- Love you, Dad.
- I love you too.

26:54.711 --> 26:55.913
You can leave it open.

26:59.083 --> 27:00.919
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

28:55.432 --> 28:57.466
What the fuck are you doing?

29:00.304 --> 29:01.272
I beg your pardon?

29:03.406 --> 29:05.175
She doesn't like you doing that.

29:10.847 --> 29:11.816
Good morning, Daddy.

29:12.415 --> 29:13.884
Good morning, son.

29:15.152 --> 29:16.988
Hey, why don't you run inside
and fix yourself some cereal?

29:20.356 --> 29:21.291
We need to talk.

29:22.425 --> 29:23.327
Is this about Ashley?

29:35.405 --> 29:37.841
I didn't expect to see you
here so early, Reverend.

29:39.910 --> 29:41.176
I need to tell you something

29:41.178 --> 29:43.348
about the day Ashley was born.

29:46.951 --> 29:47.951
Okay.

29:48.885 --> 29:51.189
We cast thee out,
every unclean spirit...

29:53.356 --> 29:56.560
every devilish power,
every legion.

30:03.500 --> 30:05.933
Reverend, morning.

30:05.935 --> 30:06.969
I didn't expect to see you.

30:06.971 --> 30:08.370
Oh, hello, Karen,

30:08.372 --> 30:10.471
I just, uh,
stopped by for a minute,

30:10.473 --> 30:11.873
sorry to intrude.

30:11.875 --> 30:13.875
Uh, just come by
the office today

30:13.877 --> 30:15.445
and we'll finish
our conversation.

30:16.313 --> 30:19.384
Okay, I got to run, I just,
uh, I'll let myself out.

30:21.484 --> 30:22.419
What's that about?

30:35.332 --> 30:37.936
Why did you say she doesn't
want me to do that?

30:39.670 --> 30:41.038
And who is she?

31:13.971 --> 31:16.604
Hey. Where are you
off to so early?

31:16.606 --> 31:18.539
I'm about to make some
breakfast, are you hungry?

31:18.541 --> 31:20.308
Oh, no, thanks,
I'm actually about to head out

31:20.310 --> 31:21.977
to meet up with an old friend.

31:21.979 --> 31:23.014
Um...

31:24.048 --> 31:25.713
But, yeah, I'll catch you later.

31:25.715 --> 31:26.583
Okay.

31:31.654 --> 31:34.392
Xander, honey, go ahead
and get ready for school.

32:09.125 --> 32:11.596
Come on, son, put them
pens away, got to go to school.

32:13.196 --> 32:16.967
I'm gonna run into town,
and I'll swing him by school on the way.

32:17.999 --> 32:19.334
- Really?
- Yeah.

32:19.336 --> 32:21.705
Yeah, Reverend, he asked
me to stop by his office.

32:22.638 --> 32:25.142
He was just here, why would
he need you to go back?

32:27.044 --> 32:28.046
Yeah, he, uh...

32:29.113 --> 32:32.150
He said that he may have
a job opportunity for me.

32:33.150 --> 32:34.384
Well, that's great.

32:35.419 --> 32:36.785
- Yeah.
- I'll be praying for you.

32:39.155 --> 32:41.323
I'm gonna, uh,
run a few errands first.

32:41.325 --> 32:43.394
I'm gonna drop his phone off,
get that screen looked at.

32:44.327 --> 32:46.027
Okay.

32:46.029 --> 32:47.264
Come on, son,
I'll meet you in the truck.

34:13.851 --> 34:15.186
Ashley?

34:19.889 --> 34:21.525
Good morning.

34:23.626 --> 34:25.193
Morning.

34:25.195 --> 34:26.431
May I help you with something?

34:27.898 --> 34:29.766
No, just looking around.

34:31.802 --> 34:33.838
Do you happen to know where
the Lakeside Market is?

34:34.605 --> 34:36.505
It's right across the street,

34:36.507 --> 34:38.543
take a right, two doors down.

34:39.643 --> 34:40.811
Thank you.

35:00.630 --> 35:02.863
- Here's your food.
- Thanks.

35:02.865 --> 35:04.465
Enjoy.

35:04.467 --> 35:05.766
Hey, Nat.

35:05.768 --> 35:07.668
Oh, my god, hey.

35:07.670 --> 35:10.204
Oh, it's so good
to see you, how are you?

35:10.206 --> 35:12.740
- Oh, my god.
- I've been better.

35:12.742 --> 35:16.211
Please, sit down,
can I get you anything, coffee?

35:16.213 --> 35:17.912
- Uh...
- An espresso, please.

35:17.914 --> 35:19.914
Yes, give me, like,
two seconds.

35:19.916 --> 35:21.550
Thanks.

35:35.199 --> 35:37.599
It's on the house.
Um, give me literally, like, two minutes,

35:37.601 --> 35:39.233
I'm gonna go
and take a break, okay?

35:39.235 --> 35:40.302
Okay.

35:50.646 --> 35:51.516
Hey.

35:53.317 --> 35:54.715
- Is that her?
- Yeah, that's her, but, please...

35:54.717 --> 35:56.483
- Right there?
- Yes, please be nice,

35:56.485 --> 35:58.221
just chill, okay?

36:03.893 --> 36:06.728
Hey, um, I'm Tyler,
I'm Nat's brother.

36:06.730 --> 36:08.798
You're Jordan,
Ashley's sister, right?

36:09.800 --> 36:11.733
Do you know her?

36:11.735 --> 36:15.237
Well, not exactly, but did you
hear what happened to her?

36:15.239 --> 36:17.271
No, all I know is
her and my aunt

36:17.273 --> 36:18.974
went off with some Dr. Carraz,

36:18.976 --> 36:21.945
and I don't really
know who he is.

36:22.612 --> 36:25.512
Well, yeah, that and what happened
to her in Mrs. Ziggler's class.

36:25.514 --> 36:29.316
- What happened?
- Listen, apparently she fell asleep in class,

36:29.318 --> 36:30.684
and then, when she woke up,

36:30.686 --> 36:32.720
she just started
screaming in horror,

36:32.722 --> 36:35.289
and it scared the shit
out of the whole class,

36:35.291 --> 36:38.525
- and the teacher too.
- Yeah, she also bit off Shane Stevens' dick.

36:38.527 --> 36:41.496
- Ew.
- No, it wasn't his dick.

36:41.498 --> 36:43.731
She bit off Shane
Stevens' tongue.

36:43.733 --> 36:46.971
She just went crazy
and totally lost her shit.

36:48.005 --> 36:51.905
- She freaked out a few times.
- That girl, she was tripping.

36:51.907 --> 36:55.610
Dude, get your ass out of here before you're
late to school again and Mom kills us both.

36:55.612 --> 36:57.579
Please, go, now!

36:57.581 --> 36:58.615
Let's get out, go!

37:00.416 --> 37:02.316
- Sorry.
- Hey, um...

37:02.318 --> 37:03.851
- What?
- Can I get your number?

37:03.853 --> 37:06.356
Get out of here, Romeo, bye!

37:07.891 --> 37:10.528
I'm on break, shall we take a walk?

37:11.427 --> 37:12.762
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

37:13.429 --> 37:16.363
- Dude, I'm just glad that you're back home.
- Yeah?

37:16.365 --> 37:18.733
- I missed you.
- And I missed you too.

37:18.735 --> 37:19.804
Oh, thanks.

37:20.771 --> 37:22.740
Do you remember when
we were seniors and...

37:23.907 --> 37:27.809
they put all the cows
and chickens in the, uh...

37:27.811 --> 37:30.679
- Yeah, in the lobby.
- In the senior... Yeah.

37:30.681 --> 37:32.847
The entryway, whatever it was.

37:32.849 --> 37:35.349
It was so ridiculous.

37:35.351 --> 37:37.519
- Like, the most random idea.
- There was poop everywhere.

37:37.521 --> 37:39.354
Dude, what reminds me of that

37:39.356 --> 37:41.923
is when my brother got
a spray paint can,

37:41.925 --> 37:44.858
and he, like, covered up all the
labels of the parking spaces,

37:44.860 --> 37:47.061
and no one knew where to park,
they were so mad.

37:47.063 --> 37:48.662
He's so funny.

37:48.664 --> 37:50.065
I know.

37:50.067 --> 37:51.800
He's something else.

37:51.802 --> 37:53.704
Yeah. I just...

37:55.072 --> 37:56.440
I don't know.

37:57.440 --> 37:58.842
This is Tanya's.

38:00.943 --> 38:02.846
She's never closed it
more than a day.

38:03.914 --> 38:04.782
Yeah.

38:07.717 --> 38:10.987
I need to tell you something,
can we sit down?

38:11.822 --> 38:13.457
Yeah, of course.

38:15.358 --> 38:17.791
Listen...

38:17.793 --> 38:19.526
I don't know if all
the other stories are true,

38:19.528 --> 38:21.532
but I need to tell you this.

38:22.498 --> 38:25.532
My mom was at church,
and Ashley was there,

38:25.534 --> 38:28.103
and she had a breakdown
in front of everyone.

38:28.105 --> 38:30.474
My mom even said
she was bleeding from her eyes.

38:31.141 --> 38:34.077
- I don't know.
- Wait, was Reverend Michael there?

38:35.512 --> 38:36.747
Yeah, of course.

38:37.514 --> 38:38.847
- I...
- I just saw him yesterday,

38:38.849 --> 38:40.518
and he didn't say
anything about it.

38:41.485 --> 38:43.454
Well, that's a small
fucking town for you.

38:44.420 --> 38:46.121
Dude, there's
secrets everywhere,

38:46.123 --> 38:47.925
but everyone still
knows your shit.

38:51.128 --> 38:53.561
You know Hannah
passed away, right?

38:53.563 --> 38:55.496
Hannah? I don't know her.

38:55.498 --> 38:57.565
She was younger than us,
but your sister

38:57.567 --> 38:58.902
and her used to hang out a lot.

38:59.635 --> 39:00.670
So what happened?

39:02.706 --> 39:05.576
She was hit by a drunk driver,
the driver died too.

39:06.842 --> 39:07.911
God.

39:08.811 --> 39:10.545
That's really messed up.

39:10.547 --> 39:12.447
Dude, what's fucked up
is that Hannah and Ashley

39:12.449 --> 39:13.983
were hanging out right
before she died.

39:14.885 --> 39:18.987
I heard that they wanted
to do a seance or something.

39:18.989 --> 39:20.858
Why would they want to do that?

39:21.625 --> 39:23.626
I heard that she wanted
to reach out to your mom.

39:24.693 --> 39:26.594
Look, Hannah was always
into ghost-hunting shit,

39:26.596 --> 39:28.733
I just think that they wanted
to see if it would work.

39:30.666 --> 39:32.434
Like, with a Ouija board?

39:32.436 --> 39:34.635
No, it was, like,
some fucking old-school way,

39:34.637 --> 39:36.704
where you, like, put,
like, a candle,

39:36.706 --> 39:38.206
put a candle on top of a Bible,

39:38.208 --> 39:40.809
and then you do a seance
in front of a mirror,

39:40.811 --> 39:42.776
and you start calling
out to the dead.

39:42.778 --> 39:43.912
I don't know.

39:45.748 --> 39:48.585
Something's not right,
I need to get to the police.

39:49.952 --> 39:51.688
Call out a report, just...

39:53.190 --> 39:55.824
I'm sorry, I have to
get back to work though, but

39:55.826 --> 39:58.829
please, let me know, text me,
just if you need anything.

39:59.496 --> 40:01.695
Thank you.
It was so good to see you.

40:01.697 --> 40:04.833
You too.
All right, bye.

40:04.835 --> 40:06.133
Bye.

40:14.110 --> 40:16.244
I need to file a missing
person's report.

40:16.246 --> 40:17.878
It's actually for two people.

40:17.880 --> 40:19.046
Can you give me the names?

40:19.048 --> 40:20.782
Yes, my sister, Ashley,

40:20.784 --> 40:22.851
she went missing a few
days ago with my aunt,

40:22.853 --> 40:24.184
Tanya Winbourne.

40:24.186 --> 40:27.054
Tanya Winbourne,
I know your aunt,

40:27.056 --> 40:29.590
she runs the art store
across the street.

40:29.592 --> 40:32.126
They're not missing.
Your sister got sick,

40:32.128 --> 40:35.063
and your aunt decided to take her out
of town for a bit with the doctor.

40:35.065 --> 40:36.967
Why do the people in this
town think that's normal?

40:38.501 --> 40:40.501
She was mentally
unstable, honey.

40:40.503 --> 40:42.871
Now we all saw her have
a panic attack in the church,

40:42.873 --> 40:47.108
and the doctor went to help her. Reverend
Michael told us Tanya was so embarrassed

40:47.110 --> 40:50.878
that she and Dr. Carraz decided to
take Ashley out of town for a bit.

40:50.880 --> 40:54.516
My sister would not leave town
without telling me first!

40:54.518 --> 40:57.684
Have you done any
investigating of this at all?

40:57.686 --> 41:00.655
- Have you talked to the reverend?
- The reverend?

41:00.657 --> 41:03.157
Yes, have you looked
under the church?

41:03.159 --> 41:05.863
Now why would
we check under the church?

41:06.630 --> 41:08.662
Look, you need to just go home

41:08.664 --> 41:10.632
and wait for your
sister and your aunt

41:10.634 --> 41:12.099
to give you a call
when they're ready to.

41:13.802 --> 41:15.603
Flowery Ranch Police
Station, please hold.

41:15.605 --> 41:17.704
Look, write your name
and number down,

41:17.706 --> 41:19.541
and if anything
comes up on our end,

41:19.543 --> 41:20.811
we will give you a call.

41:21.811 --> 41:22.880
Thank you for holding.

41:23.847 --> 41:25.280
Hey, Monge.

41:25.282 --> 41:26.150
How's Troy?

41:29.251 --> 41:30.318
Yeah.

41:31.820 --> 41:33.320
I can't keep this
up much longer,

41:33.322 --> 41:36.090
things are getting
way out of hand,

41:36.092 --> 41:38.095
I'm spiraling out
of control here.

41:39.128 --> 41:40.827
I can't do this anymore.

41:40.829 --> 41:42.597
<i>The Bible says
God can restore</i>

41:42.599 --> 41:43.601
<i>what is broken</i>

41:44.668 --> 41:46.936
<i>and change it
into something amazing.</i>

41:48.605 --> 41:50.204
<i>He's working through
you right now,</i>

41:50.206 --> 41:52.510
<i>you have to remain strong.</i>

41:53.076 --> 41:54.177
Stay strong?

41:55.579 --> 41:59.213
Tanya Winbourne
is in catatonic shock.

41:59.215 --> 42:01.081
Two people are dead already,

42:01.083 --> 42:03.786
and I'm gonna be in prison
if you don't get me help!

42:04.621 --> 42:08.222
Reverend Michael, you're gonna have
to keep it together a few more days.

42:08.224 --> 42:11.862
Help is on the way, and we
will take care of everything.

42:12.728 --> 42:14.964
But you need to stay calm.

42:17.132 --> 42:19.233
Someone will be in touch.

42:19.235 --> 42:21.204
Stay calm.

42:35.351 --> 42:37.987
This is crucified...

42:39.722 --> 42:41.057
dead and bury it.

42:43.326 --> 42:45.862
We need to send it into hell.

42:49.766 --> 42:51.798
"On the third day,

42:51.800 --> 42:56.706
he rose from the dead
and he sent it into heaven,

42:57.373 --> 43:01.644
as if from the right hand
of God, the Father almighty."

43:04.847 --> 43:07.817
"And hence
he shall come to judge

43:08.985 --> 43:10.721
the quick, the dead."

43:13.356 --> 43:14.389
Judge.

43:48.925 --> 43:49.927
Come in.

43:53.762 --> 43:57.097
The ladies from the Red Hat Club
aren't buying Pastor John's story.

43:57.099 --> 43:58.733
What do you want
me to do with it?

43:58.735 --> 44:00.838
Stick to your story,
I'll talk to them.

44:03.306 --> 44:05.208
- You okay?
- Yes, fine, thank you.

44:06.342 --> 44:08.311
Okay, Mark's here to see you.

44:10.045 --> 44:10.913
Send him in.

44:15.184 --> 44:17.050
Mark.

44:17.052 --> 44:18.186
Mark, how are you?

44:18.188 --> 44:19.990
Here, have a seat here.

44:21.324 --> 44:23.894
Can I get you
a drink or anything?

44:25.360 --> 44:28.898
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot,
please forgive me.

44:29.798 --> 44:31.199
Yeah.

44:31.201 --> 44:33.166
No, I haven't had
a drink since I found out

44:33.168 --> 44:35.068
that Karen was
pregnant with Xander.

44:35.070 --> 44:35.938
Of course.

44:39.074 --> 44:41.978
So, uh, is it nice
having Jordan home now?

44:43.847 --> 44:44.882
Yeah.

44:45.380 --> 44:46.683
Yeah, it's been great.

44:47.983 --> 44:49.249
Although she blames me
for everything

44:49.251 --> 44:50.788
that happened to her mother.

44:51.286 --> 44:52.755
I can see that in her eyes.

44:54.891 --> 44:55.892
We're working through it.

44:59.195 --> 45:02.865
I just want to be
a better father to my children.

45:04.934 --> 45:06.367
I'm grateful for any opportunity

45:06.369 --> 45:08.806
that I have to be
supportive to Jordan.

45:10.172 --> 45:12.842
I just hope I'm not too late
to be the same for Ash.

45:14.309 --> 45:15.478
It's never too late.

45:19.548 --> 45:21.215
Mark,

45:21.217 --> 45:22.853
what I'm about to tell you

45:23.987 --> 45:26.155
is gonna be very
difficult to understand...

45:28.458 --> 45:29.860
but you deserve the truth.

45:32.795 --> 45:34.028
Yeah.

45:34.030 --> 45:34.898
Ashley...

45:36.465 --> 45:39.168
has had the same demon

45:40.170 --> 45:41.371
that possessed Sarah.

45:42.438 --> 45:43.840
It's taken control of her.

45:51.380 --> 45:55.451
You mean, like, personal demons,
like mental issues?

45:57.085 --> 45:59.519
Listen to me, listen to me,

45:59.521 --> 46:02.759
I have been doing
God's work for over...

46:04.092 --> 46:05.261
40 years,

46:06.329 --> 46:10.067
and I've tried my best,
but I don't know,

46:11.501 --> 46:13.537
I don't know if I can
do this anymore.

46:16.105 --> 46:18.108
Do what? Preach?

46:25.280 --> 46:28.351
We cast thee out,
every unclean spirit...

46:30.519 --> 46:33.923
every devilish power,
every legion.

46:42.164 --> 46:44.802
In the name and power
of Jesus Christ,

46:45.467 --> 46:50.371
God the Father commands you,
the Holy Spirit commands you,

46:50.373 --> 46:52.009
the son of God commands you,

46:53.309 --> 46:56.409
in the name of Jesus Christ,
I cast you out!

48:07.951 --> 48:10.284
I'm sorry, Reverend,
I'm having a hard time keep...

48:10.286 --> 48:11.521
Sarah!

48:12.655 --> 48:17.057
Sarah and Ashley are possessed
by the Devil himself,

48:17.059 --> 48:20.396
and I should've
let Sarah die that day.

48:23.967 --> 48:24.902
You're drunk.

48:26.402 --> 48:28.972
You're drunk, and I saw
her going in the ground.

48:30.539 --> 48:31.942
I was there!

48:33.543 --> 48:34.945
I tried to do my best.

48:37.713 --> 48:41.682
I tried to do God's will,
but I don't know anymore.

48:41.684 --> 48:45.155
I have done and seen things

48:46.121 --> 48:49.025
that no human should
ever have to endure.

48:50.293 --> 48:51.260
Done?

48:53.061 --> 48:54.729
You're out of your fucking mind!

48:58.534 --> 49:00.400
- Is everything okay?
- It's all right, it's all right, Geoff.

49:00.402 --> 49:01.605
You tell me where they are!

49:02.605 --> 49:04.574
What happened to my daughter?!

49:06.208 --> 49:09.275
I swear to God,
you tell me, goddammit!

49:09.277 --> 49:11.345
If you know where they are,

49:11.347 --> 49:13.780
I find out that you're
keeping anything from me,

49:13.782 --> 49:15.685
I will fucking kill you!

49:16.418 --> 49:17.418
- I don't know.
- I swear to God,

49:17.420 --> 49:19.021
I will fucking kill you!

49:29.599 --> 49:30.734
Mark...

49:32.534 --> 49:34.200
Jordan is next.

50:44.407 --> 50:45.542
Fuck this.

51:02.824 --> 51:03.692
Shit.

51:05.427 --> 51:06.563
Shit, you scared me.

51:07.496 --> 51:09.098
What are you doing up?

51:09.898 --> 51:10.766
Are you...

51:13.603 --> 51:14.570
Are you all right?

51:16.706 --> 51:17.641
All right?

51:21.577 --> 51:24.815
I haven't been all right
in 17 goddamn years.

51:27.849 --> 51:29.351
I thought you quit drinking?

51:31.353 --> 51:33.920
If you recall, Ashley
and I were taken away from you

51:33.922 --> 51:36.257
because you were driving
us around drunk.

51:36.259 --> 51:38.762
How much longer till you'll
be driving Xander around drunk?

51:39.929 --> 51:41.162
Hmm?

51:41.164 --> 51:42.566
I just needed a drink,

51:43.798 --> 51:44.668
that's all.

51:48.204 --> 51:51.204
There's a lot of shit going on

51:51.206 --> 51:53.407
that you don't know
nothing about.

51:53.409 --> 51:56.376
You think there's a lot going on
around here that I don't know about?

51:56.378 --> 52:00.213
You should've heard the way they were
talking about Ashley today around town.

52:00.215 --> 52:01.849
Some of the things
that I heard about her,

52:01.851 --> 52:03.316
they're talking about her

52:03.318 --> 52:04.517
the way that they
talked about Mom.

52:04.519 --> 52:06.787
I've heard those people talk.

52:06.789 --> 52:08.258
So you're just getting drunk?

52:08.925 --> 52:11.128
That's why Mom
never married you.

52:17.934 --> 52:19.836
You think it was easy for me?

52:21.304 --> 52:22.172
Hmm?

52:23.706 --> 52:26.143
Losing the mother
of my two children?

52:28.878 --> 52:30.577
I wasn't ever
a good parent to you

52:30.579 --> 52:32.979
because I didn't know
how to do it alone.

52:32.981 --> 52:35.885
You didn't know how to be
anything but a drunk.

52:37.719 --> 52:38.721
I tried.

52:39.855 --> 52:41.525
I tried, goddammit!

52:42.657 --> 52:44.293
You know what,
I knew this was a mistake.

52:45.393 --> 52:46.894
I shouldn't have come here.

52:46.896 --> 52:48.829
Don't worry,
I'll leave in the morning.

52:48.831 --> 52:50.396
I fucked it up, Jordan.

52:55.771 --> 52:57.507
It'll be okay in the morning.

52:58.940 --> 52:59.974
It'll be all right
in the morning.

52:59.976 --> 53:01.909
Yeah, it will.

53:01.911 --> 53:03.179
Come on.

53:03.778 --> 53:05.481
It'll be all right
in the morning.

54:19.655 --> 54:21.258
Mom!

54:39.909 --> 54:40.977
Hey, Xander.

54:46.014 --> 54:47.983
You want to stay
in here with me tonight?

54:59.527 --> 55:00.961
Xander?

55:00.963 --> 55:02.632
There's someone under my bed.

55:04.900 --> 55:07.900
I don't know, Xander,
I don't see anything.

55:07.902 --> 55:09.071
It was right there.

55:13.608 --> 55:14.877
Can I just sleep
with you tonight?

55:16.445 --> 55:17.647
I don't know, Xander.

55:32.561 --> 55:35.396
Actually, okay, why don't you stay
in my room tonight? It's okay.

57:17.666 --> 57:18.868
Sarah?

57:31.646 --> 57:32.514
I'm sorry.

57:39.989 --> 57:42.155
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

57:45.226 --> 57:47.663
I haven't been there
for our children.

57:50.532 --> 57:51.800
The drinking.

57:53.202 --> 57:55.104
I've sinned.

01:01:57.445 --> 01:01:58.780
Hey.

01:02:03.786 --> 01:02:05.988
I just want to tell you
how proud I am of you.

01:02:08.824 --> 01:02:12.494
I feel like this is
a new start for all of us.

01:02:14.496 --> 01:02:15.731
A new beginning.

01:02:19.333 --> 01:02:21.367
This is your chance
to be the kind of father

01:02:21.369 --> 01:02:23.505
you've always wanted
to be to the girls.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:28.311
The kind of father
you are to Xander.

01:02:33.215 --> 01:02:34.283
Love you.

01:02:37.585 --> 01:02:38.520
Mark?

01:02:40.155 --> 01:02:41.423
Can you hear me?

01:02:42.557 --> 01:02:43.760
Are you sleeping?

01:02:51.233 --> 01:02:52.535
Honey,

01:02:53.501 --> 01:02:54.536
what's wrong?

01:02:55.938 --> 01:02:57.006
What's wrong?

01:02:59.208 --> 01:03:00.242
What's wrong?

01:05:06.735 --> 01:05:09.401
Xander, get up!
Come on, we've got to go!

01:05:11.373 --> 01:05:13.706
- What's going on?
- Come on, just come with me, please.

01:05:15.309 --> 01:05:17.376
What's happening?!

01:05:17.378 --> 01:05:19.481
Close the door, close that door.

01:05:25.186 --> 01:05:27.753
Come on. We don't have time
right now, we don't have time.

01:05:27.755 --> 01:05:30.590
I just need to get you
out of here, okay? Look at me.

01:05:30.592 --> 01:05:32.325
I need you to be brave.

01:05:32.327 --> 01:05:35.327
I'm gonna lower you
down to the ground, okay?

01:05:35.329 --> 01:05:37.396
- Okay.
- And when you get there, I need you to run...

01:05:37.398 --> 01:05:39.231
- I'm scared.
- ...and call 9-1-1.

01:05:39.233 --> 01:05:41.200
What's going on?

01:05:41.202 --> 01:05:43.639
It's gonna be okay,
you just have to get to safety.

01:05:45.539 --> 01:05:49.075
Okay. All right, look,
Xander, I know this is scary,

01:05:49.077 --> 01:05:51.244
but you can do this.
I'm gonna be right behind you, okay?

01:05:51.246 --> 01:05:53.012
Go!

01:05:53.014 --> 01:05:53.682
Go.

01:06:13.101 --> 01:06:14.133
Go!

01:06:14.135 --> 01:06:15.170
Run!

01:06:38.527 --> 01:06:39.825
Xander?

01:06:39.827 --> 01:06:41.030
Xander?

01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:43.496
Xander?

01:06:43.498 --> 01:06:44.700
Xander?

01:06:45.666 --> 01:06:47.266
Xander?

01:06:47.268 --> 01:06:48.267
Answer me!

01:06:51.739 --> 01:06:53.706
No!

01:06:53.708 --> 01:06:55.307
Dad, no!

01:06:55.309 --> 01:06:57.112
No!

01:06:57.679 --> 01:06:59.545
Please, Dad, no!

01:06:59.547 --> 01:07:00.646
Please!

01:07:00.648 --> 01:07:03.282
It's me, please, Dad, no!

01:07:03.284 --> 01:07:04.751
It's me.

01:07:04.753 --> 01:07:07.554
Please, Dad, no!

01:07:07.556 --> 01:07:08.791
Please, please.

01:07:17.231 --> 01:07:18.400
Please.

01:07:23.838 --> 01:07:25.775
Go, Xander. Go.

01:07:26.807 --> 01:07:28.340
Go.

01:07:28.342 --> 01:07:29.575
Come on.

01:07:32.581 --> 01:07:33.449
Here.

01:07:41.889 --> 01:07:44.724
Okay, Xander, you have
to get in here, okay?

01:07:44.726 --> 01:07:46.461
- Okay. Okay.
- And hide.

01:07:52.134 --> 01:07:54.666
I am going upstairs
to call the police.

01:07:54.668 --> 01:07:56.135
I'm coming right back.

01:07:56.137 --> 01:07:57.836
- Okay.
- Do not leave.

01:07:57.838 --> 01:07:59.808
Do not leave here,
I will be right back.

01:08:35.777 --> 01:08:37.242
Shit.

01:08:44.752 --> 01:08:46.585
<i>9-1-1,
what is your emergency?</i>

01:08:46.587 --> 01:08:48.821
It's my father,
he's trying to kill us.

01:08:48.823 --> 01:08:51.223
<i>Oh, okay, ma'am, I'm gonna
need you to speak up,</i>

01:08:51.225 --> 01:08:53.192
<i>I can barely hear you.</i>

01:08:53.194 --> 01:08:55.260
<i>It sounded like you said
someone's trying to kill you?</i>

01:08:55.261 --> 01:08:56.795
<i>Who's trying to kill you?</i>

01:08:56.796 --> 01:08:59.566
He's coming, please,
I don't have much time.

01:08:59.568 --> 01:09:01.300
- It's my father.
- <i>Well, hold on, ma'am,</i>

01:09:01.301 --> 01:09:02.868
<i>I'm trying to understand you.</i>

01:09:02.871 --> 01:09:04.903
My father, he killed
his fucking wife,

01:09:04.904 --> 01:09:06.705
there's blood everywhere.

01:09:06.707 --> 01:09:08.974
<i>Okay, stay on the line with me.</i>

01:09:08.975 --> 01:09:10.710
<i>What is your exact location?</i>

01:09:10.712 --> 01:09:12.745
I don't know,
I'm in the middle of nowhere.

01:09:12.747 --> 01:09:15.848
It's the old farmhouse
on Old Creek Mill Road.

01:09:15.850 --> 01:09:17.616
Please hurry.

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:07.563
He's here.

01:11:38.393 --> 01:11:40.029
He's coming.
My god, he's coming!

01:11:40.895 --> 01:11:42.928
<i>Okay,
stay on the line with me.</i>

01:12:55.036 --> 01:12:56.635
Shit.

01:12:56.637 --> 01:12:58.039
Xander! Xander.

01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:00.540
Thank God.

01:13:00.542 --> 01:13:01.610
Okay.

01:13:05.613 --> 01:13:06.481
Come here.

01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:10.616
Come on, we got
to get out of here.

01:13:10.618 --> 01:13:11.787
Yeah. Come on.

01:13:19.461 --> 01:13:21.063
Go, go, run!

01:13:22.564 --> 01:13:24.597
- Run.
- Are you okay?

01:13:24.599 --> 01:13:25.598
Oh, god.

01:13:28.837 --> 01:13:30.072
Come on, Xander.

01:13:37.045 --> 01:13:38.680
Is my mom okay?

01:13:49.858 --> 01:13:50.926
Listen...

01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:55.160
I'm not going anywhere, okay?

01:13:55.162 --> 01:13:58.798
I'm right here,
I'm staying with you, okay?

01:13:58.800 --> 01:13:59.967
Okay.

01:14:19.654 --> 01:14:20.785
- Help!
- Come on, Xander.

01:14:20.787 --> 01:14:22.655
- Help us!
- Help us!

01:14:22.657 --> 01:14:23.789
- Come on, Xander!
- Help us, please!

01:14:23.791 --> 01:14:25.657
- Please, help us!
- Come on.

01:14:25.659 --> 01:14:27.559
- He's in the back of the car!
- Here, you'll be safe.

01:14:27.561 --> 01:14:29.528
- He's in the back of the car!
- Climb in. Come in!

01:14:29.530 --> 01:14:31.664
- Xander, get in.
- You'll be safe.

01:14:31.666 --> 01:14:34.567
You'll be safe in here. Stay there.

01:14:34.569 --> 01:14:36.768
We were en route to
the house and found the kids,

01:14:36.770 --> 01:14:38.737
now we're in pursuit
of the father.

01:14:38.739 --> 01:14:40.238
<i>10-4.</i>

01:14:56.189 --> 01:14:57.759
Trunk's empty.

01:15:07.068 --> 01:15:09.335
Officer down, I need backup,
officer down, I need backup!

01:15:09.337 --> 01:15:10.635
I repeat, officer...

01:15:19.713 --> 01:15:21.714
No!

01:15:21.716 --> 01:15:23.683
Dad, stop!

01:15:23.685 --> 01:15:25.017
- No!
- Dad, please!

01:15:25.019 --> 01:15:27.119
- No!
- Dad!

01:15:27.121 --> 01:15:29.287
- No!
- Dad, please, stop!

01:15:29.289 --> 01:15:31.059
- Stop.
- No! No.

01:15:32.827 --> 01:15:33.695
Oh, god!

01:15:34.895 --> 01:15:36.661
- Please stop.
- Please.

01:15:36.663 --> 01:15:37.862
No!

01:15:41.368 --> 01:15:44.769
Please don't do this.
Please don't do this, Daddy.

01:15:44.771 --> 01:15:47.072
Daddy, please.

01:15:47.074 --> 01:15:49.976
Please, don't this,
Dad, it's me!

01:15:49.978 --> 01:15:52.812
- Help!
- Please don't do this!

01:15:52.814 --> 01:15:54.650
Please don't do this, Dad!

01:15:55.149 --> 01:15:57.983
Dad, please, it's me.

01:15:57.985 --> 01:16:01.086
Dad! Help!

01:16:01.088 --> 01:16:06.058
I can't, I can't,
I can't.

01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:07.229
No!

01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:10.196
Dad, I can't, please, no.

01:16:11.932 --> 01:16:13.734
No, I can't!

01:16:24.412 --> 01:16:26.582
No!

01:17:18.932 --> 01:17:23.468
Chief, Chief,
we have two officers down.

01:17:23.470 --> 01:17:24.937
<i>We have
a 1033 in progress</i>

01:17:24.939 --> 01:17:26.708
<i>and a possible 1015.</i>

01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:42.053
- Chief Lane.
- What exactly is going on?

01:17:42.055 --> 01:17:44.757
Houston's out back digging
up a grave that we found.

01:17:44.759 --> 01:17:46.125
- A grave?
- Yeah.

01:17:46.127 --> 01:17:47.992
- Who's in it?
- We don't know yet.

01:17:47.994 --> 01:17:50.196
Deputy Callahan's inside talking
to Reverend Michael now.

01:17:50.198 --> 01:17:51.800
And how's he holding up?

01:17:52.432 --> 01:17:55.134
Well, he's had
quite a bit to drink, ma'am.

01:17:55.136 --> 01:17:57.172
- Just go get him out.
- All right.

01:17:58.905 --> 01:18:01.339
Chief, this is fucking crazy.

01:18:01.341 --> 01:18:03.375
We were digging into the dirt
out back, and we found bodies.

01:18:03.377 --> 01:18:06.812
- Bodies? How many?
- Two for now.

01:18:06.814 --> 01:18:09.147
I think it's Pastor
John and Dr. Carraz.

01:18:09.149 --> 01:18:11.250
- Oh, my god.
- I'm gonna keep digging.

01:18:11.252 --> 01:18:13.753
- I'll keep you posted, okay?
- Yeah.

01:18:13.755 --> 01:18:17.790
Possessions is where
the demons walk among us.

01:18:17.792 --> 01:18:20.358
It's making a huge mistake.

01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:22.997
You can't let them do this,
you got to take her out.

01:18:25.198 --> 01:18:28.366
Ma'am, you're gonna want
to take a look in the basement.

01:18:28.368 --> 01:18:30.503
We found these padded
cells down there.

01:18:30.505 --> 01:18:32.838
Tanya Winbourne
and I think her niece, Ashley,

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:34.773
are both locked up in there.

01:18:34.775 --> 01:18:36.174
They're letting them out now,

01:18:36.176 --> 01:18:37.311
we're gonna need
an ambulance.

01:18:39.279 --> 01:18:41.412
<i>Stay back, stay back!</i>

01:18:41.414 --> 01:18:42.915
<i>Stay back, I need backup!</i>

01:18:42.917 --> 01:18:44.116
<i>Stay back, stay back!</i>

01:18:56.063 --> 01:18:58.233
You're gonna rot in jail,
you son of a bitch.

01:20:17.979 --> 01:20:22.083
Our Father, Lord in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

01:20:23.417 --> 01:20:26.485
Thy Kingdom come,
thy will be done,

01:20:26.487 --> 01:20:28.390
on Earth as it is in heaven.

01:20:38.332 --> 01:20:43.669
Give us this day our daily
bread, and forgive us our debts,

01:20:43.671 --> 01:20:46.004
as we forgive our debtors,

01:20:46.006 --> 01:20:50.177
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

01:20:52.113 --> 01:20:53.280
Amen.
