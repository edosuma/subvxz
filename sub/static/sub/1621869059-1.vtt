WEBVTT

03:22.550 --> 03:24.752
God, I'm fucking starving.

03:24.786 --> 03:28.223
Hey, you have any more
of that candy left?

03:28.257 --> 03:29.125
No.

03:30.658 --> 03:31.793
I'm gonna pop the
trunk, can you grab the

03:34.128 --> 03:34.996
flowers?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.502
Unbelievable.

04:25.947 --> 04:26.815
Here.

04:27.882 --> 04:29.551
I think you should do it.

05:07.923 --> 05:09.891
Listen, Adam.

05:09.925 --> 05:11.894
I understand why you're angry.

05:11.927 --> 05:12.795
I'm sorry.

05:15.697 --> 05:16.665
I mean.

05:16.697 --> 05:17.966
I mean come on, man.

05:18.000 --> 05:18.867
Not here.

05:20.101 --> 05:20.969
Not now.

05:22.370 --> 05:24.272
Hey, you remember?

05:24.305 --> 05:26.175
Remember when dad used to
drag us out to Evans City

05:26.208 --> 05:27.242
to go visit Grandpa's stone?

05:27.274 --> 05:28.876
Johnny, not now.

05:28.910 --> 05:30.646
You would cry the
entire way there.

05:31.346 --> 05:33.182
Come on.

05:33.214 --> 05:35.216
Dad went and hid behind one
of those big tombstones.

05:35.250 --> 05:37.786
and you were always too scared
to get outta the fuckin' car.

05:37.819 --> 05:40.756
And here comes Dad
stumblin' after you

05:40.788 --> 05:44.192
like some sorta
Frankenstein or something.

05:44.225 --> 05:46.095
"They're coming to get you."

05:46.127 --> 05:49.197
Barbara, we need to get a
photo of Grandma's tombstone.

05:49.230 --> 05:50.766
Mom wants one.

06:03.745 --> 06:04.614
Shit.

06:05.312 --> 06:06.716
What's wrong?

06:11.452 --> 06:12.820
Still nothin'?

06:12.853 --> 06:13.723
No.

06:15.690 --> 06:18.259
God, I just wanna
get outta here.

06:18.293 --> 06:20.862
You act like you're
so scared of this place.

06:20.896 --> 06:21.764
Stop it.

06:23.964 --> 06:25.233
Wait a second.

06:27.334 --> 06:29.437
You are still scared of
this place, aren't you?

06:29.471 --> 06:32.007
Johnny, stop it. I mean it.

06:32.040 --> 06:33.242
They're coming to get you.

06:33.274 --> 06:35.109
Oh my god, stop it.

06:35.142 --> 06:36.310
- You are being a prick.
- They're coming for you.

06:36.343 --> 06:38.079
Look, here comes
one of them now!

06:38.112 --> 06:38.947
Johnny!

06:38.980 --> 06:40.816
Jesus Christ,

06:40.848 --> 06:41.949
this is why I did not wanna
come out here with you.

06:41.983 --> 06:43.352
I knew this was gonna happen.

06:43.384 --> 06:45.086
You cannot act like an adult.

06:45.120 --> 06:46.754
You are such a child.

06:46.788 --> 06:48.790
God, I fucking hate you.

07:25.459 --> 07:27.028
Johnny, no!

07:27.062 --> 07:28.396
Johnny!

07:28.430 --> 07:29.465
John!

07:29.497 --> 07:30.331
No!

07:30.365 --> 07:31.400
John, help me!

07:36.771 --> 07:38.106
Get to the car!

07:45.514 --> 07:46.915
Get to the car!

07:57.291 --> 08:00.295
What the?

08:52.980 --> 08:53.849
No!

08:55.250 --> 08:56.884
No!

08:56.918 --> 08:57.787
No!

09:01.523 --> 09:02.391
No!

09:03.991 --> 09:06.327
Stop!

09:10.331 --> 09:11.200
Stop!

11:11.653 --> 11:14.056
No.

11:25.567 --> 11:28.169
This message
is being transmitted

11:28.202 --> 11:31.139
to the request of the
Office of Civil Defense.

11:31.172 --> 11:33.475
This is an emergency broadcast.

11:33.508 --> 11:35.009
This is not a test.

11:35.043 --> 11:37.111
Multiple law
enforcement agencies

11:37.144 --> 11:40.749
are warning of
for the following counties:

11:40.782 --> 11:44.619

Bloomfield, Douglasville,

11:50.524 --> 11:53.761

and Putney Air Force Base.

11:53.794 --> 11:56.397
This is a dangerous situation.

12:56.758 --> 12:59.293
Help, help!

12:59.326 --> 13:00.428
Help!

15:57.804 --> 15:58.906
Hey!

15:58.940 --> 16:00.709
The hell you doin' in here?

16:00.741 --> 16:01.976
Tryin' to steal my truck, man?

16:02.009 --> 16:02.910

16:02.943 --> 16:04.245
- Huh?

16:04.278 --> 16:05.614
Tryin' to steal my truck, eh?

16:05.647 --> 16:06.748
You tryin' to steal
my truck, man.

16:06.780 --> 16:09.650
No, no.

16:13.388 --> 16:14.756
Fuck.

16:14.788 --> 16:16.490
Fucking kid.

16:16.524 --> 16:17.491
Where you from, man?

16:23.431 --> 16:24.633
Where you from?

16:24.666 --> 16:26.969
Kid!

16:28.769 --> 16:31.840
You're not from
around here, are you?

16:34.542 --> 16:35.410
Fuck.

16:38.346 --> 16:39.514
Fucking luck.

16:39.547 --> 16:41.817
Fuckin' piece of shit truck.

16:45.320 --> 16:48.523
This damn kid.

16:50.357 --> 16:55.029
Look, I gotta grab this
canister and get some gas.

16:55.062 --> 16:59.366
If you stick with me, I get
you where you tryin' to go.

16:59.399 --> 17:00.367
Is that okay?

17:00.400 --> 17:01.302
Can I count on you?

17:04.439 --> 17:06.074
All right, look.

17:06.106 --> 17:09.577
These damn things is all
over the place, so come on.

17:31.566 --> 17:34.402
C'mon, them cars is useless.

17:34.434 --> 17:36.538
I checked 'em earlier.

17:36.570 --> 17:38.740
But there's a pump out front.

17:38.772 --> 17:42.509
It's locked, so I
gotta find a key.

17:42.542 --> 17:45.779
It'd be nice if you
helped me, all right?

17:57.991 --> 17:59.094
The fuck is your problem, man?

17:59.126 --> 18:01.762
We don't have time to waste.

18:16.644 --> 18:18.846
I'ma check the front lobby.

18:20.548 --> 18:22.416
You check over there.

18:22.450 --> 18:24.952
If you see or hear anything,

18:24.986 --> 18:27.155
you yell and I'll come
runnin', all right?

20:32.246 --> 20:33.147
No.

20:33.180 --> 20:34.582
No, no!

20:34.615 --> 20:35.583
No!

21:35.809 --> 21:36.644
C'mon, c'mon.

21:36.676 --> 21:37.311
Get up, get up.

21:37.345 --> 21:38.880
Go, go, go.

21:45.286 --> 21:46.153
Shit.

22:12.380 --> 22:13.248
Go!

22:44.412 --> 22:45.380
Get to the house.

22:45.413 --> 22:46.948
Don't stop runnin'.

23:00.994 --> 23:01.962
Get to the house!

23:52.246 --> 23:53.081
All right, it's clear.

23:53.114 --> 23:54.148
Boy, get in.

23:54.181 --> 23:56.116
Boy, get in this house.

24:10.931 --> 24:11.899
Must be them things.

24:11.932 --> 24:13.334
You stay right here.

27:50.750 --> 27:53.020
Adam, don't look at it.

31:24.597 --> 31:28.536
I figure we bunk it down
in here for the night.

31:31.939 --> 31:33.474
Kill these lights

31:36.276 --> 31:37.510
and we keep quiet.

31:41.214 --> 31:44.284
Shouldn't be too
much to worry about.

31:44.317 --> 31:45.818
We in the middle of nowhere.

31:45.852 --> 31:46.954
I don't see too
many of 'em things

31:46.987 --> 31:49.190
findin' their way out here.

31:51.290 --> 31:52.159
The hell?

31:55.429 --> 31:58.399
Now why don't you help me close
the blinds and the curtains?

31:58.432 --> 32:01.235
Make sure them things
can't see in here

32:01.268 --> 32:03.770
and keep an eye out
for any candles.

32:03.804 --> 32:07.807
We need to keep this
place dark as possible.

32:07.840 --> 32:09.542
Yeah.

32:09.576 --> 32:11.745
Yeah, the less they
know we ain't here,

32:11.778 --> 32:13.647
the better we gon' be.

32:16.583 --> 32:17.951
And there ain't no chance

32:17.984 --> 32:20.788
that this gonna hold
up against them things.

32:20.820 --> 32:22.722
Couple more and
it's comin' down.

34:36.556 --> 34:38.092
Adam, get over here.

34:39.126 --> 34:40.094
Whoa.

34:40.126 --> 34:41.661
Hey, calm down, friend.

34:41.695 --> 34:42.996
Where in the
hell you come from?

34:43.028 --> 34:44.130
The cellar.

34:44.164 --> 34:45.466
We heard noises down there.

34:45.498 --> 34:46.866
You thought you heard noises?

34:46.900 --> 34:48.869
Man, I fired gunshots
over an hour ago.

34:48.902 --> 34:50.604
Ain't no way you
ain't hear that shit.

34:50.637 --> 34:51.972
Man, to be real.

34:52.005 --> 34:53.874
With what's goin' on,

34:53.907 --> 34:55.509
we don't know who we can
and can't trust right now.

34:55.541 --> 34:57.777
We came up the minute
we thought it was clear.

34:57.811 --> 34:59.579
- If we didn't know-
- Know what?

34:59.612 --> 35:01.013
Hey, turn that off.

35:01.047 --> 35:02.949
You want them thing
to see us in here?

35:02.983 --> 35:06.120
Things aren't fuckin' smart
enough to figure that out.

35:06.152 --> 35:07.754
And if they were, you tell me

35:07.788 --> 35:09.389
they don't already
know that we're here

35:09.422 --> 35:11.491
because of that little
fucker right there

35:11.525 --> 35:13.693
screamin' his head off
like some little girl.

35:14.728 --> 35:15.829
Shut the fuck up!

35:15.862 --> 35:17.097
Hey, you leave him alone.

35:17.130 --> 35:19.500
He's got every right to scream.

35:19.532 --> 35:21.634
- You all don't know-
- Oh really, huh?

35:21.668 --> 35:24.671
Don't know what you've
been through, huh?

35:24.704 --> 35:26.073
Hey, I don't need
you comin' in here

35:26.106 --> 35:28.442
and tellin' me
what I don't know.

35:28.474 --> 35:31.010
We get a pack of them
things tip our bus over

35:31.043 --> 35:32.179
out on the interstate.

35:32.211 --> 35:33.813
My bus, my people.

35:35.114 --> 35:37.951
I've seen what
those things can do.

35:39.119 --> 35:40.754
No idea.

35:40.786 --> 35:43.189
Hey, calm down, fellas.

35:43.222 --> 35:46.826
We're all here so we gain
nothing by arguing about it.

35:46.860 --> 35:48.528
I suggest we just-

35:48.561 --> 35:50.431
- Hey, what're you doin'?

35:50.463 --> 35:52.132
This stuff's comin' down
to the basement with me.

35:52.164 --> 35:53.467
Like hell it is.

35:53.500 --> 35:54.902
That boy found that food.

35:54.934 --> 35:56.503
Hey, we found this place

35:56.536 --> 35:58.938
long before your
sorry ass got here.

35:58.972 --> 36:00.774
This your house?

36:00.806 --> 36:02.542
Hey, I don't care whose
fuckin' house it is.

36:02.576 --> 36:04.110
Is this your house?

36:04.143 --> 36:06.145
Calm down, fellas.

36:06.179 --> 36:09.048
We have far more important
things to worry about.

36:09.081 --> 36:12.152
I don't give a rat's
ass whose house it is.

36:12.184 --> 36:14.153
It's the principle of
the thing, ain't it?

36:14.186 --> 36:15.822
Nobody's comin' in here

36:15.856 --> 36:19.126
and telling me what
I can and can't do.

36:19.159 --> 36:21.061
Like I said,

36:21.094 --> 36:23.030
this is not your house.

36:24.164 --> 36:26.500
You do not have final say.

36:30.971 --> 36:33.641
Did you guys hear that?

37:01.300 --> 37:03.103
They're right on the porch.

37:03.135 --> 37:04.570
Yeah, see?

37:04.603 --> 37:05.972
I told you.

37:06.005 --> 37:07.974
It's all this one's
screamin' from earlier.

37:08.007 --> 37:09.675
We got 'em comin'
from miles around.

37:09.708 --> 37:10.676
It's all your fault.

37:10.710 --> 37:11.677
Hey.

37:12.846 --> 37:13.947
I say be up all alone in here.

37:13.980 --> 37:16.750
Shh, would you guys be quiet?

37:16.782 --> 37:19.552
You know how many
of them are out there?

37:19.585 --> 37:21.888
Get that one on the porch.

37:21.922 --> 37:24.124
I'll from the other way.

37:24.157 --> 37:25.925
There's additions.

37:25.958 --> 37:27.094
I know we can.

37:28.594 --> 37:30.196
Yeah, so you think so.

37:30.230 --> 37:32.833
But what if you're through
before it turned into 30 or 40?

37:35.869 --> 37:37.671
100 of those things, huh?

37:37.704 --> 37:39.840
What then, sonny boy?

37:39.873 --> 37:40.974
Does that mean
any of them things

37:41.007 --> 37:42.608
walkin' around out there?

37:42.641 --> 37:44.977
Okay, but we fucked no
matter where we headed.

37:45.010 --> 37:47.280
Well you got a bunch of
'em all out there already.

37:49.815 --> 37:52.084
What the hell are you doin'?

37:52.117 --> 37:53.286
Now when I say open that door-

37:53.320 --> 37:54.621
- No.

37:54.653 --> 37:56.023
C'mon, man.

37:56.056 --> 37:57.657
We gotta know what
we up against.

38:03.862 --> 38:06.165
You better prepare yourself.

38:06.199 --> 38:08.635
God only knows what we're
gettin' into tonight.

39:18.905 --> 39:20.374
Shut the hell up.

39:23.076 --> 39:24.177
Holy shit, man.

39:24.210 --> 39:26.813
What the fuck is wrong with it?

39:26.846 --> 39:27.715
Look.

39:29.949 --> 39:32.385
Got bite marks all over it.

39:32.418 --> 39:34.054
Human marks.

39:34.086 --> 39:35.956
What are you saying?

39:37.190 --> 39:39.927
That these
things'll bite people.

40:08.253 --> 40:10.857
What can you hear, anything?

40:12.291 --> 40:15.028
No, it's just quiet right now.

40:17.463 --> 40:20.333
Do you think one of
us should go up there?

40:20.365 --> 40:21.768
I don't know.

40:27.072 --> 40:29.208
Open the damn door.

40:31.311 --> 40:34.014
The hell is going
on up there, Harry?

40:34.047 --> 40:35.449
Everything's fine.

40:35.481 --> 40:36.949
One of those things got inside.

40:36.983 --> 40:38.385
What if they got in the house?

40:38.418 --> 40:39.720
It's all right.

40:39.753 --> 40:41.955
Few of us managed to kill it.

40:44.389 --> 40:45.725
I wanna see.

40:54.266 --> 40:56.435
So what exactly was going on?

40:56.469 --> 40:58.072
Two people, men.

40:58.938 --> 41:00.073
I knew it.

41:00.106 --> 41:01.341
Those things don't scream.

41:01.373 --> 41:02.942
We should've helped.

41:02.976 --> 41:05.211
We did when we
knew we could do so,

41:05.244 --> 41:08.280
not risking our lives for
some complete strangers.

41:08.313 --> 41:10.116
Of course not, Harry.

41:10.150 --> 41:12.519
So do they know what's goin' on?

41:12.552 --> 41:15.889
Nah, couple of royal fuck-ups.

41:15.922 --> 41:17.224
One's a slack-jawed nigger.

41:17.257 --> 41:19.326
And the other one, oh yeah.

41:19.358 --> 41:20.994
I'm pretty sure
he's damn faggot.

41:21.027 --> 41:23.195
Jesus, like any
of that matters.

41:23.228 --> 41:24.764
What are the chances, huh?

41:24.797 --> 41:26.198
Tell me they
have a goddamn car.

41:26.231 --> 41:27.199
I don't know.

41:27.233 --> 41:28.835
You don't know?

41:28.867 --> 41:30.436
We're trapped here and
you didn't think to ask

41:30.469 --> 41:32.338
that of anybody?

41:32.371 --> 41:33.940
Helen, we were already too
busy with stuff up there!

41:33.972 --> 41:35.307
- Oh, of course.
- We didn't have time

41:35.340 --> 41:36.041
to think of anything
of that stuff.

41:36.074 --> 41:37.476
Harry.

41:37.510 --> 41:38.812
You were too worried
about who they are

41:38.844 --> 41:40.212
and what you see wrong with them

41:40.246 --> 41:42.081
to think if they could
actually help us!

41:42.114 --> 41:42.949
Helen.

41:43.882 --> 41:45.050
We were too busy.

42:32.898 --> 42:35.301
I didn't get your name, pal.

42:37.036 --> 42:37.905
Ben.

42:41.074 --> 42:42.943
Listen, Ben.

42:42.976 --> 42:45.211
About what you were
saying in there

42:45.244 --> 42:47.447
regarding lighting and all,

42:48.981 --> 42:52.018
do you believe that
to be the case?

42:52.050 --> 42:52.920
I do.

42:54.320 --> 42:55.189
I seen it.

42:56.356 --> 42:57.424
Those things,

42:58.657 --> 43:01.327
they ain't just killin' people.

43:02.461 --> 43:04.463
They fuckin' eatin' 'em.

43:05.331 --> 43:06.932
Are you sure?

43:06.965 --> 43:08.301
I seen it, man.

43:09.568 --> 43:10.971
And after that,

43:12.005 --> 43:14.207
the people they eat?

43:14.239 --> 43:15.174
They get up

43:16.576 --> 43:20.012
and they start to do
the same damn thing.

43:24.983 --> 43:25.853
Listen.

43:26.552 --> 43:28.588
Harold in there,

43:28.621 --> 43:31.590
he's got his little
girl in the cellar.

43:31.623 --> 43:32.958
She's been hurt.

43:38.697 --> 43:40.900
What do you mean hurt?

43:41.967 --> 43:44.570
Now I can't say for sure.

43:44.603 --> 43:47.073
- But-
- What do you mean hurt?

43:50.076 --> 43:51.144
She was bit.

44:26.012 --> 44:28.481
Go let 'em know downstairs.

44:28.514 --> 44:30.450
We all need to know
what's goin' on.

44:53.239 --> 44:55.175
Helen?

44:55.208 --> 44:59.479
They found a TV and they
want you to help set it up.

45:06.018 --> 45:07.153
Have a seat.

45:11.157 --> 45:13.026
You must be Cooper's wife.

45:13.059 --> 45:14.027
Helen.

45:14.059 --> 45:14.728
I'm Ben.

45:15.795 --> 45:18.030
How's the kid doin'?

45:18.063 --> 45:18.731
Bad.

45:19.798 --> 45:21.567
Fever's eating her alive.

45:21.601 --> 45:23.202
Now we had some
aspirin in my purse

45:23.235 --> 45:25.705
and that's not even gonna work.

45:27.072 --> 45:28.474
Do we know anything?

45:28.507 --> 45:30.643
Hopefully we'll find
out somethin' soon.

45:30.675 --> 45:34.146
But right now, let's
go join the others.

45:37.282 --> 45:38.717
How you doin', buddy?

45:38.751 --> 45:39.619
You okay?

45:41.387 --> 45:43.155
I wanna go home.

45:43.188 --> 45:45.125
That's what we're
tryin' to figure out.

45:45.157 --> 45:47.326
But right now, we
gotta hang tight

45:47.360 --> 45:49.396
'til we find out where
we could head to.

45:49.429 --> 45:51.463
We need to know where it's safe,

45:51.496 --> 45:54.333
then we'll get you home, okay?

46:02.474 --> 46:03.309
That kid,

46:05.177 --> 46:07.579
I got the feeling your husband
might have an issue with him.

46:07.612 --> 46:10.250
Harry has an issue
with a lot of things.

46:10.282 --> 46:12.217
Yeah, I can tell.

46:12.251 --> 46:16.122
Listen, I know you have a
lot on your hands right now.

46:16.155 --> 46:18.792
But that kid's seen a lot.

46:18.824 --> 46:21.660
He's barely keepin' it together.

46:21.693 --> 46:25.498
Do you think you can keep the
peace until we get outta here?

46:25.530 --> 46:26.532
Of course.

46:27.532 --> 46:28.801
Thanks.

46:28.835 --> 46:29.702
C'mon.

46:32.405 --> 46:33.273
Adam?

46:35.208 --> 46:36.076
I'm Helen.

46:38.143 --> 46:40.479
Look, I know you're
scared right now.

46:40.512 --> 46:41.715
I'm scared too.

46:44.317 --> 46:47.086
I was wondering if
maybe it would be okay

46:47.119 --> 46:49.056
if we could be friends.

46:50.422 --> 46:52.625
It's easier to be
scared together.

46:57.597 --> 47:00.166
This just in: a
report from the CDC.

47:00.199 --> 47:01.267
Okay, that's it.

47:01.300 --> 47:02.169
We got it.

47:03.503 --> 47:05.472
Stating that there
is a connection

47:05.505 --> 47:08.807
between these attacks and
unexplained wave of power outages

47:08.840 --> 47:11.478
that have been affecting
a growing number

47:11.510 --> 47:15.514
of major and lowlife cities
all across the nation.

47:15.547 --> 47:19.384
These incidents reportedly
began around 3:30 this morning.

47:19.418 --> 47:23.155
And this time we can neither
confirm nor deny this report,

47:23.188 --> 47:26.259
but we are now able
to tell you that-

47:27.626 --> 47:29.128
- The hell you doin'?
- Advising citizens

47:29.161 --> 47:29.795
to stay inside.

47:29.829 --> 47:31.164
Stop it!

47:31.197 --> 47:32.465
Right now!

47:32.498 --> 47:33.833
- Listen.
- We are now being told

47:33.865 --> 47:35.701
that civilian
defense authorities

47:35.735 --> 47:39.204
are now providing rescue
stations with food, shelter.

47:39.237 --> 47:40.672
Sounds like they're
gonna list off

47:40.706 --> 47:42.474
some of those medical
centers on here soon.

47:42.507 --> 47:44.510
We need to take
Karen to one of those.

47:44.543 --> 47:47.246
Right, but the nearest
city's 10 miles away.

47:47.280 --> 47:50.216
And without a vehicle,
we don't have a chance.

47:50.248 --> 47:51.617
Number of counties.

47:51.650 --> 47:53.853
Neither of you
two have a vehicle?

47:53.885 --> 47:56.523
Broken down 'bout
a mile down the road.

47:56.556 --> 47:58.458
Tried to get some gas
from the station there,

47:58.490 --> 48:00.159
but pumps is locked.

48:00.193 --> 48:01.628
Wait, you have a truck?

48:01.661 --> 48:03.496
Man, it ain't gon'
work without no gas.

48:03.528 --> 48:05.731
No, dude. Judy works
at the gas station.

48:05.764 --> 48:07.299
Contacting
state and local authorities.

48:07.333 --> 48:08.568
You got keys?

48:08.601 --> 48:09.702
Have failed.

48:09.735 --> 48:10.903
The federal government.

48:10.936 --> 48:12.438
Don't you got keys?

48:12.471 --> 48:15.407
Comment at this time.

48:15.440 --> 48:17.376
Jesus Christ.

48:17.409 --> 48:18.610
All right, man. Let's go.

48:18.643 --> 48:19.478
No, no, no.

48:19.512 --> 48:20.880
Hold on now.

48:20.913 --> 48:22.414
What is it, about
10, 15 of them things

48:22.447 --> 48:23.916
out there in that field?

48:23.949 --> 48:25.518
The last thing we need to do

48:25.550 --> 48:27.420
is run out there
without a game plan.

48:27.452 --> 48:29.521
I don't think we
should go anywhere

48:29.554 --> 48:31.657
until we know where we're going.

48:31.690 --> 48:33.592
Look, I agree.

48:33.626 --> 48:36.896
Look, we gotta figure out how
to get that girl to a clinic.

48:36.929 --> 48:39.331
The TV said that it's gon' be
showin' a list of the centers

48:39.364 --> 48:40.699
any minute now, right?

48:40.733 --> 48:42.501
Should happen any moment now.

48:42.534 --> 48:43.670
All right now, look.

48:43.702 --> 48:45.938
You three come with me.

48:45.972 --> 48:49.342
We need to figure out
what we gon' do and fast.

48:49.375 --> 48:52.378
And Cooper, I'm gonna need
you to come with us too.

48:52.411 --> 48:55.215
I'm gonna need you to man
that door, keep shit on lock.

48:55.248 --> 48:56.916
- Now wait a minute here.
- Now Helen.

48:56.949 --> 48:58.784
Look, I'm gonna need you
to have that child ready.

48:58.818 --> 49:03.323
So as soon as we get back,
we can get outta here.

49:03.356 --> 49:04.958
We have reports
of people being mauled.

49:04.990 --> 49:07.360
Adam, you all right?

49:07.393 --> 49:08.795
A state of emergency

49:08.827 --> 49:10.563
has been reported in
the following states:

49:10.596 --> 49:11.864
- Pennsylvania, Maine.
- Yeah.

49:11.896 --> 49:12.766
Good.

49:13.965 --> 49:15.634
If I give you a job to do,

49:15.668 --> 49:17.537
you think you can
handle it for me?

49:17.570 --> 49:19.472
We'll be remaining
on air, every hour,

49:19.505 --> 49:20.472
- on the hour.
- Yeah.

49:20.505 --> 49:21.507
You a lifesaver.

49:21.539 --> 49:23.442
Now listen.

49:23.476 --> 49:26.613
What I need you to do is stay
planted here right by this TV.

49:26.646 --> 49:29.315
The minute they start to
announce one of them clinics are,

49:29.347 --> 49:31.282
I need you to come get me fast.

49:31.284 --> 49:32.719
Can you handle that?

49:32.751 --> 49:34.320
- This just
in: unverified report.

49:34.353 --> 49:35.655
Then we can go home.

49:35.688 --> 49:37.657
Then we can go home.

49:37.690 --> 49:41.927
But we gon' be right in that
room right next door, 'kay?

49:41.960 --> 49:43.262
Cooper, c'mon.

49:44.597 --> 49:46.666
Growing number of
major and lowlife cities

49:46.699 --> 49:48.568
all across the nation.

49:48.601 --> 49:50.603
These incidents
reportedly began occurring

49:50.635 --> 49:53.773
around 3:30 a.m. this morning.

49:53.806 --> 49:58.612
At this time, we can't even
confirm nor deny this report.

50:00.346 --> 50:02.648
How're you doin'?

50:02.681 --> 50:04.916
Oh god, love you so much.

50:04.949 --> 50:06.852
Are you out of your mind?

50:06.885 --> 50:09.489
Do you really think these
clowns are reliable enough?

50:09.521 --> 50:11.290
What do you
suggest we do, Harry?

50:11.324 --> 50:12.791
We wait here 'til
somebody comes and finds us.

50:12.824 --> 50:15.527
Did you look out that window?

50:15.561 --> 50:19.298
There are at least 15 of
those freaks out there!

50:19.331 --> 50:21.634
And you wanna what, wait
for them to come to us?

50:21.666 --> 50:24.304
But they're not comin'
down here, are they?

50:24.336 --> 50:26.072
Oh, you know that, Harry?

50:26.105 --> 50:27.907
You know that?

50:27.940 --> 50:29.742
And what if by some crazy
chance they do, huh?

50:29.775 --> 50:30.644
Then what?

50:32.711 --> 50:34.447
You can stay down here,

50:34.480 --> 50:39.385
but I am not waiting for
those things to find us.

50:39.418 --> 50:41.019
I'm leaving and I'm
taking care of my-

50:41.052 --> 50:44.489
- I don't know who
put it in your head

50:44.523 --> 50:47.693
that you're allowed to
speak to me this way.

50:47.726 --> 50:51.797
But this shit, this shit
is gonna stop right now!

50:52.864 --> 50:53.932
Do you hear me?

50:53.965 --> 50:55.601
Hey,

50:55.634 --> 50:56.601
is everything all
right down there?

50:56.635 --> 50:57.603
Leave me alone!

50:57.635 --> 50:59.505
I'm with my daughter!

51:14.052 --> 51:16.588
Karen,.

51:16.621 --> 51:17.489
Honey.

51:21.460 --> 51:23.463
Karen, we gotta go, babe.

51:26.431 --> 51:27.699
It's a man.

51:27.733 --> 51:29.535
Why's this a man?

52:12.043 --> 52:14.079
Workin' hard, huh?

52:14.112 --> 52:15.381
Everyone else

52:16.114 --> 52:17.516
runnin' around,

52:19.150 --> 52:20.686
boardin' shit up,

52:21.820 --> 52:23.757
workin' their asses off

52:25.157 --> 52:28.461
while you're in here
sittin' on yours,

52:30.228 --> 52:32.030
watchin' the old TV.

52:34.599 --> 52:36.835
Seems like a pretty
sweet deal to me.

52:46.744 --> 52:50.016
I'm just doing what
he asked me to do.

52:51.050 --> 52:52.051
Yeah, well

52:53.219 --> 52:54.086
lucky you.

52:56.188 --> 53:00.794
Wished somebody asked me if
I wanted to sit on my ass,

53:02.027 --> 53:03.061
keep watch.

53:03.094 --> 53:05.030
God had warned them

53:05.063 --> 53:07.599
time and time and time again.

53:09.235 --> 53:13.639
We're merely setting ourselves
up to experience his wrath.

53:13.672 --> 53:16.208
It has happened before:

53:16.242 --> 53:17.710
the Great Flood,

53:18.643 --> 53:20.078
Sodom and Gomorrah.

53:21.646 --> 53:22.481
Really?

53:22.514 --> 53:23.715
It'll happen.

53:24.650 --> 53:26.085
We can't time it.

53:26.117 --> 53:27.820
Why?

53:27.853 --> 53:31.057
Because we safe.

53:31.090 --> 53:33.893
Please I want to come down.

53:33.925 --> 53:37.630
Someone who knows what
it's all about, huh?

53:37.663 --> 53:40.632
Lady knows what
she's talkin' about.

53:45.670 --> 53:48.006
Have you ever read the Bible?

53:49.041 --> 53:49.909
Right.

53:50.842 --> 53:52.211
I thought as much.

53:54.880 --> 53:55.748
Now me,

53:57.181 --> 53:59.818
consider myself a man of God

53:59.851 --> 54:01.987
and I hell read that Bible

54:03.054 --> 54:04.656
front to back, back to front.

54:04.690 --> 54:07.527
I've studied every
page in that Bible.

54:08.594 --> 54:11.664
That's the inspired word of God

54:11.697 --> 54:15.835
and I put that word
right here in my heart.

54:15.867 --> 54:17.003
That's a fact.

54:19.170 --> 54:21.240
Lemme tell you somethin'.

54:23.742 --> 54:25.945
Studyin' that inspired book

54:28.614 --> 54:33.286
and knowin' what I know, seein'
what's goin' on out there,

54:35.054 --> 54:37.123
Well I've come to believe

54:38.724 --> 54:42.028
and it's all because
of a few individuals

54:43.862 --> 54:47.199
like some of the ones we
have hidin' out right here

54:47.231 --> 54:49.635
in this very house tonight.

54:52.670 --> 54:53.806
You know what I mean?

54:53.838 --> 54:56.241
You followin' what I'm sayin'?

54:59.010 --> 55:01.079
I know what you are, boy.

55:04.115 --> 55:07.119
Cooper, what's
going on over here?

55:09.253 --> 55:10.789
Nothin'.

55:10.822 --> 55:12.824
Nothin' goin' on at all.

55:14.059 --> 55:16.596
Just watchin' a little bit of

55:17.996 --> 55:21.600
truth in television
with my TV buddy here.

55:22.934 --> 55:26.304
You keep watchin' that
screen, young man.

55:26.338 --> 55:28.141
We're countin' on ya.

55:30.342 --> 55:32.912
To stay inside
and lock the doors.

55:32.945 --> 55:35.748
We will now implement
civilian defense authorities

55:35.780 --> 55:37.349
are now providing
rescue stations

55:37.382 --> 55:40.652
with food, shelter and
medical assistance.

55:40.686 --> 55:42.954
A list of these rescue stations
will be provided shortly.

55:42.987 --> 55:45.924
Ben, they're listing
the emergency centers.

55:45.958 --> 55:47.827
A number of counties
on the east coast

55:47.860 --> 55:50.930
currently under a state
of emergency have failed.

55:50.963 --> 55:53.365
All the states of Maine,
Delaware and Rhode Island

55:53.398 --> 55:55.067
and all through the state.

56:15.420 --> 56:16.221
All right.

56:17.889 --> 56:19.025
Did any of you recognize
a single listin'

56:19.057 --> 56:20.992
from that emergency broadcast?

56:21.025 --> 56:22.360
Willard.

56:22.393 --> 56:23.828
It's not even an
hour drive from here.

56:23.862 --> 56:24.930
Can you get us there?

56:24.963 --> 56:26.798
Yeah, no doubt.

56:26.831 --> 56:29.300
If we get that truck goin',
then I can get us there.

56:29.333 --> 56:31.737
You're kidding me, right?

56:33.871 --> 56:34.940
Babe, what?

56:36.141 --> 56:37.677
Judy, only half the time.

56:37.710 --> 56:38.844
No.

56:38.876 --> 56:40.413
Babe, we've no other choice.

56:40.445 --> 56:41.713
No.

56:41.746 --> 56:43.281
- Judy.
- No, not yet!

56:51.090 --> 56:53.325
Ben, just gimme
five minutes with her.

56:53.358 --> 56:55.961
I just gotta reassure her
that things are gonna be fine,

56:55.994 --> 56:57.896
then we can go.

56:57.929 --> 56:59.297
All right, do what
you gotta do, man.

56:59.331 --> 57:00.432
- Just five minutes.
- Just hurry up.

57:00.465 --> 57:01.701
Five minutes, all right?

57:19.952 --> 57:21.487
You didn't lock it.

57:21.519 --> 57:23.222
I tried.

57:23.255 --> 57:25.490
The lock was broken.

57:25.523 --> 57:27.460
Made that easy on me.

57:29.061 --> 57:30.329
Hey, look at me.

57:32.864 --> 57:34.899
It's gonna be fine.

57:34.932 --> 57:38.237
Just don't understand
why it has to be you.

57:38.269 --> 57:40.472
Why can't they just
do it by themselves?

57:40.505 --> 57:42.807
You know why it has to be me.

57:42.840 --> 57:46.244
You know I could outrun
those two any day.

57:48.179 --> 57:50.716
Why do you keep leaving me?

57:52.050 --> 57:55.287
First the military
and now this?

57:55.320 --> 57:57.789
Come here, c'mere,
c'mere, c'mere.

57:57.822 --> 57:59.759
You know I can do this.

58:01.260 --> 58:03.463
You know I have to do this.

58:05.364 --> 58:06.231
Babe, just

58:07.231 --> 58:08.768
be strong for me.

58:09.867 --> 58:11.269
After this, I promise you

58:11.302 --> 58:14.172
I'm never goin' to
leave you again.

58:15.273 --> 58:16.141
Okay?

58:17.141 --> 58:18.910
It's a goddamn promise.

58:38.996 --> 58:40.365
Hey, how many of 'em things

58:40.398 --> 58:42.233
stand between us
and the gas station?

58:42.266 --> 58:46.038
There's gonna be at
least 12 of 'em scattered there.

58:46.070 --> 58:49.808
All right,
you a runner, Tom?

58:49.842 --> 58:52.244
Ran track in high school.

58:52.277 --> 58:54.813
Listen, I'ma ask you
to somethin' for me.

58:54.847 --> 58:56.282
I need you to run
over to them pumps,

58:56.315 --> 58:58.918
fill up the tanks
I got over there.

58:58.951 --> 59:00.385
Think you can handle that?

59:00.418 --> 59:01.987
Whatever it takes.

59:02.019 --> 59:03.155
If it's gonna get us
out of here, no problem.

59:03.188 --> 59:04.557
Good.

59:04.590 --> 59:06.992
I'll watch your
back the whole way.

59:07.025 --> 59:09.061
You'll need your speed,
so we be in and out.

1:00:33.210 --> 1:00:34.479
Light the torch.

1:00:35.480 --> 1:00:36.581
Light the torch!

1:00:54.565 --> 1:00:56.034
Go catch up to the other one.

1:00:56.068 --> 1:00:58.003
I got you covered.

1:02:17.748 --> 1:02:18.616
C'mon.

1:02:21.219 --> 1:02:22.054
Open.

1:02:22.086 --> 1:02:23.588
Fuck, fuck!

1:03:22.481 --> 1:03:25.717
Already infected on the
primary disease factor.

1:03:25.750 --> 1:03:28.586
It seems to be spread
mainly via bodily fluids

1:03:28.619 --> 1:03:32.757
such as blood or saliva,
so scratches and bites.

1:03:32.791 --> 1:03:33.659
Bites?

1:03:35.327 --> 1:03:37.129
Yes, it does appear

1:03:38.762 --> 1:03:41.699
that most cases the illness
is being spread through bites.

1:03:41.733 --> 1:03:44.635
Is this disease spread
through direct contact

1:03:44.668 --> 1:03:46.237
with the aggressors?

1:03:46.271 --> 1:03:48.474
Through bites that
you've stated,

1:03:48.507 --> 1:03:50.509
what is the risk of infection

1:03:50.541 --> 1:03:52.577
and what preventative
measures can be taken

1:03:52.610 --> 1:03:54.445
to protect oneself
if they are unable-

1:03:54.478 --> 1:03:57.148
- At this point based off what
we know about the disease,

1:03:57.181 --> 1:04:00.685
the bites have proven
to be highly contagious.

1:04:00.719 --> 1:04:02.487
And we simply haven't
had enough time to study

1:04:02.521 --> 1:04:06.225
to postulate on any
methods of treatment.

1:04:06.257 --> 1:04:08.826
So you're
saying there is no cure.

1:04:08.860 --> 1:04:10.528
At this time, no.

1:04:12.329 --> 1:04:15.134
So what options does
that leave our viewers?

1:04:15.166 --> 1:04:19.304
Well if you or someone
you know has been bitten,

1:04:19.336 --> 1:04:20.771
from what we've gathered,

1:04:20.804 --> 1:04:24.375
the window period
of the infection.

1:04:24.409 --> 1:04:28.247
Well it can last anywhere from
a few hours to a day or two.

1:04:28.280 --> 1:04:31.383
So it depends on all the
variables: the age of the victim,

1:04:31.416 --> 1:04:33.318
their health status
prior to the injury,

1:04:33.351 --> 1:04:35.586
the severity of
the bite or wound.

1:04:35.619 --> 1:04:37.288
- All of these things.
- But in the end,

1:04:37.322 --> 1:04:39.858
what you are saying
is that a bite

1:04:39.891 --> 1:04:43.195
through one of these infected,
as you been calling them,

1:04:43.228 --> 1:04:45.764
has a 100% transition rate.

1:04:47.766 --> 1:04:50.869
I'm sorry, I cannot
comment on that.

1:05:02.313 --> 1:05:04.782
This isn't gonna
be enough, Ben.

1:05:04.815 --> 1:05:06.651
Do you think I know that?

1:05:06.684 --> 1:05:10.188
Look, you two just
get to the truck.

1:05:10.222 --> 1:05:12.758
Get enough gas in
there to get it goin'.

1:05:12.791 --> 1:05:15.928
Then you come back
here to pick me up.

1:05:16.994 --> 1:05:17.929
All right, sounds good.

1:05:17.963 --> 1:05:19.464
Let's go.

1:06:23.927 --> 1:06:25.998
What the hell are we doing?

1:07:03.902 --> 1:07:05.704
Okay, give it a shot.

1:07:09.974 --> 1:07:10.942
It's not outta gas.

1:07:10.974 --> 1:07:12.710
It's fuckin' dead.

1:07:12.744 --> 1:07:14.079
What?

1:07:16.081 --> 1:07:16.949
Oh fuck.

1:07:31.496 --> 1:07:32.364
My god.

1:07:55.686 --> 1:07:57.755
In God's name are
you tryin' to do?

1:07:57.789 --> 1:07:59.624
Outta your mind?

1:07:59.657 --> 1:08:02.126
Stop it!

1:08:02.159 --> 1:08:03.862
You little bitch.

1:08:15.606 --> 1:08:16.807
Oh shit.

1:09:07.826 --> 1:09:09.962
Karen, how're you doin'?

1:09:13.765 --> 1:09:15.033
Oh god.

1:09:15.065 --> 1:09:16.667
Oh god.

1:10:16.060 --> 1:10:18.730
Oh god.

1:10:20.765 --> 1:10:21.600
You see that?

1:10:21.632 --> 1:10:23.033
Do you see that?

1:10:23.067 --> 1:10:27.472
Do you see how many of
them there are?

1:10:29.207 --> 1:10:30.642
I can't get out.

1:10:30.675 --> 1:10:32.110
We're goin' in, Helen.

1:10:32.143 --> 1:10:33.811
You know it is our only choice.

1:10:33.845 --> 1:10:34.945
It's our only choice.

1:10:34.979 --> 1:10:36.114
Harry, I'm really scared!

1:10:36.146 --> 1:10:38.617
You know it's our only choice.

1:10:38.649 --> 1:10:40.085
We'll be quiet.

1:10:40.118 --> 1:10:41.086
We'll be fine, won't we?

1:10:41.118 --> 1:10:42.086
Pray to God.

1:10:42.119 --> 1:10:43.220
We'll pray to God.

1:10:43.253 --> 1:10:44.288
He's gonna get us through this.

1:10:44.322 --> 1:10:45.257
You'll see.

1:10:45.289 --> 1:10:46.725
Look, I promise.

1:10:46.757 --> 1:10:47.858
We'll pray to him.

1:10:47.891 --> 1:10:49.661
Everything's gonna be okay.

1:10:49.694 --> 1:10:51.563
I'm goin' to get Adam.

1:10:51.595 --> 1:10:52.263
No, no.

1:10:53.331 --> 1:10:54.966
We can't just leave the boy.

1:10:54.998 --> 1:10:56.667
I said no!

1:10:56.701 --> 1:10:58.537
That faggot.

1:10:58.569 --> 1:11:00.639
That faggot and his kind,
that's why we're in his mess!

1:11:00.671 --> 1:11:03.541
And I'll be damned if I'm
gonna let him bring his sin,

1:11:03.574 --> 1:11:06.144
his pestilence down into
that cellar with us.

1:11:06.176 --> 1:11:08.112
No, he's not going
to endanger my life

1:11:08.145 --> 1:11:10.047
or my daughter's life.

1:11:13.585 --> 1:11:15.220
You're crazy.

1:11:15.252 --> 1:11:19.757
You are just as evil as
those things out there.

1:11:19.791 --> 1:11:20.859
Guys, open up.

1:11:20.891 --> 1:11:22.293
It's Ben.

1:11:22.327 --> 1:11:24.029
I said go down!

1:11:24.061 --> 1:11:25.264
C'mon, y'all.

1:11:26.597 --> 1:11:28.132
C'mon, man. Open the door!

1:11:28.166 --> 1:11:29.167
Open the door!

1:11:29.199 --> 1:11:30.167
C'mon, man!

1:11:30.201 --> 1:11:31.168
Damn things out here.

1:11:31.202 --> 1:11:32.904
Open the damn door.

1:11:32.936 --> 1:11:35.039
I told you to
go to the cellar!

1:11:35.073 --> 1:11:36.675
You're disgusting.

1:11:36.707 --> 1:11:38.076
You call yourself a man of God,

1:11:38.109 --> 1:11:39.711
but you're nothing
but a goddamn-

1:11:41.311 --> 1:11:43.148
Don't you ever,

1:11:43.180 --> 1:11:47.117
ever, ever use my
Lord's name against me!

1:11:50.054 --> 1:11:51.756
Fucking whore, do you hear me?

1:11:56.194 --> 1:11:58.764
No!

1:12:29.092 --> 1:12:32.896
You guys keep them things
from gettin' inside the doors.

1:12:32.930 --> 1:12:34.899
Oh god, they're right outside.

1:12:34.931 --> 1:12:36.300
Find me somethin' to burn.

1:12:36.333 --> 1:12:38.103
What are you doin'?

1:12:38.136 --> 1:12:39.771
They're scared of the fire.

1:12:39.804 --> 1:12:41.172
I'll keep 'em at bay

1:12:41.204 --> 1:12:42.841
at least for a short
period of time.

1:12:42.873 --> 1:12:44.341
No, all you're doin'
is bringin' 'em here.

1:12:44.375 --> 1:12:45.877
It's like sendin' up
a giant smoke signal.

1:12:45.909 --> 1:12:46.845
Would you shut up?

1:12:46.877 --> 1:12:48.012
Just shut it!

1:13:12.302 --> 1:13:13.837
Help me.

1:15:01.945 --> 1:15:02.980
Get down.

1:15:20.430 --> 1:15:21.500
I stole fire.

1:15:22.966 --> 1:15:23.934
They're afraid.

1:15:23.967 --> 1:15:25.836
They're afraid of fire.

1:15:25.869 --> 1:15:28.073
That will buy us some time.

1:15:33.310 --> 1:15:38.215
anything to burn, okay?

1:16:04.975 --> 1:16:09.213
We gotta board up the
windows and the doors.

1:16:09.247 --> 1:16:11.850
Pretty soon them things
gonna be all over this place.

1:16:11.882 --> 1:16:13.083
We gotta hurry.

1:16:14.085 --> 1:16:15.552
Outta your damn mind?

1:16:15.586 --> 1:16:17.422
Board up the doors, the windows?

1:16:17.454 --> 1:16:19.289
What other choice
we got, Cooper?

1:16:21.158 --> 1:16:25.496
Pretty soon them things
gonna be finished over there.

1:16:25.529 --> 1:16:27.031
Who do you think gonna be next?

1:16:36.172 --> 1:16:37.307
Okay, let's go.

1:16:40.543 --> 1:16:45.550
They gon' surround this
place and tear the fuck apart

1:16:46.617 --> 1:16:48.319
unless we try to keep 'em out.

1:16:48.351 --> 1:16:49.921
Between you and Helen,

1:16:49.953 --> 1:16:52.189
this place is makin'
too much noise.

1:16:52.222 --> 1:16:54.893
All it's gonna do is let
'em know that we're in here.

1:16:54.926 --> 1:16:57.195
We may as well go out
on the front porch

1:16:57.228 --> 1:16:58.328
and call out to 'em!

1:16:58.362 --> 1:17:00.597
They already know, man.

1:17:00.631 --> 1:17:01.499
They know.

1:17:02.432 --> 1:17:03.568
It's too late to hide.

1:17:08.104 --> 1:17:09.306
We gotta fight.

1:17:13.978 --> 1:17:15.646
Ladies
and gentlemen,

1:17:15.680 --> 1:17:18.917
I have just been updated with
new and horrifying details.

1:17:21.551 --> 1:17:22.953
Ben.

1:17:28.024 --> 1:17:29.293
I don't
know any other way.

1:17:35.733 --> 1:17:37.201
Get the screws
outta the box, Harry.

1:18:09.500 --> 1:18:10.667
That's not big enough.

1:18:10.701 --> 1:18:12.436
Who is this?

1:18:22.279 --> 1:18:23.381
So it
goes to the wall?

1:18:23.413 --> 1:18:25.617
Yes, go into there.

1:18:27.217 --> 1:18:28.353
We have to
find a way to punch.

1:18:28.386 --> 1:18:29.354
Only thing still working.

1:18:32.590 --> 1:18:33.423
Hurry, hurry.

1:18:33.457 --> 1:18:34.592
Just put it in.

1:18:34.625 --> 1:18:36.094
Get it up, c'mon.

1:18:38.796 --> 1:18:41.265
Let's get this up here.

1:18:41.297 --> 1:18:42.632
Cooper, c'mon over here.

1:18:42.666 --> 1:18:44.202
Help us out, man.

1:18:45.603 --> 1:18:46.471
No.

1:18:48.338 --> 1:18:50.408
Brought this on yourself.

1:18:52.143 --> 1:18:54.045
You know what this
is, don't you?

1:18:55.378 --> 1:18:56.247
See it.

1:18:57.614 --> 1:18:59.182
High, board's high.

1:18:59.216 --> 1:19:01.352
See it because
of people like you.

1:19:01.385 --> 1:19:02.686
You're the reason they're here.

1:19:02.720 --> 1:19:04.588
They're coming for you.

1:19:11.628 --> 1:19:12.564
All of you.

1:19:14.497 --> 1:19:19.470
All of you are
sinners, the whole lot of you.

1:19:23.274 --> 1:19:26.411
God's vengeance will
be on your heads.

1:19:28.578 --> 1:19:31.515
You're outta
your fuckin' mind.

1:19:31.548 --> 1:19:33.150
I'll throw your ass out there

1:19:33.184 --> 1:19:35.453
and feed you to
them fuckers, man.

1:19:35.485 --> 1:19:38.689
Don't you leave us up
here, you son of a bitch.

1:20:04.681 --> 1:20:05.682
I'm sorry.

1:20:06.817 --> 1:20:08.485
No.

1:20:26.470 --> 1:20:27.538
No.

1:20:27.570 --> 1:20:28.439
God, no.

1:20:29.672 --> 1:20:30.774
No.

1:20:30.807 --> 1:20:31.676
No.

1:20:31.708 --> 1:20:33.310
No.

1:20:49.592 --> 1:20:50.461
Fuck.

1:20:53.631 --> 1:20:55.233
Y'all just stay here, man.

1:23:36.894 --> 1:23:39.430
Ow!

1:23:48.505 --> 1:23:49.172
Karen.

1:25:26.203 --> 1:25:27.071
Oh baby.

1:25:28.805 --> 1:25:30.073
Oh my.

1:25:30.106 --> 1:25:31.074
Karen.

1:26:29.733 --> 1:26:30.568
Help!

1:26:32.202 --> 1:26:33.070
Ben!

1:26:35.037 --> 1:26:36.172
No,

1:26:36.206 --> 1:26:37.740

1:26:48.217 --> 1:26:49.720
Dammit, Adam. What?

1:27:16.712 --> 1:27:17.680

1:27:22.152 --> 1:27:23.587
No.

1:27:23.619 --> 1:27:24.488
Don't!

1:27:25.221 --> 1:27:26.289
Don't!

1:27:26.323 --> 1:27:30.060
Help me!

1:27:30.092 --> 1:27:30.961
Help me!

1:27:32.061 --> 1:27:33.130
Help me!

1:27:33.162 --> 1:27:35.899

1:27:37.768 --> 1:27:39.036
No!

1:27:39.069 --> 1:27:40.237
Help me!

1:27:40.270 --> 1:27:41.839
Don't, help me!

1:36:17.087 --> 1:36:17.755
Whoa.

1:36:23.126 --> 1:36:24.828
Deader than a , man.

1:36:24.860 --> 1:36:28.497
Man, he done got
fucked the fuck up.

1:36:28.530 --> 1:36:31.601
Check his pockets
for some goodies.

1:36:46.815 --> 1:36:48.184
Nothin'?

1:36:48.217 --> 1:36:49.286
No.

1:36:49.319 --> 1:36:50.521
Son of a bitch.

1:36:52.255 --> 1:36:54.324
All right, load him up.

1:37:03.298 --> 1:37:06.103
You know a way to
get to that tower?

1:37:06.136 --> 1:37:08.505
Yeah, me and the boys had
this old four-wheeler path

1:37:08.537 --> 1:37:10.539
we used to take.

1:37:10.573 --> 1:37:15.112
I figure it'll give us good
cover and we'll make good time.

1:37:15.145 --> 1:37:16.813
Good.

1:37:16.845 --> 1:37:20.282
'Cause I wanna get back to
Evans City before night.

1:37:20.315 --> 1:37:21.484
What are your numbers?

1:37:21.518 --> 1:37:22.786
I'm at 58.

1:37:22.819 --> 1:37:24.521
Hmm.

1:37:24.554 --> 1:37:25.422
65.

1:37:28.891 --> 1:37:31.627
Let's get 100 each and
call it a day, huh?

1:37:31.661 --> 1:37:32.895
Yeah, I
figure that'll make us

1:37:32.929 --> 1:37:34.463
the talk of the town.

1:37:34.497 --> 1:37:35.832
Oh yeah.

1:37:35.864 --> 1:37:37.333
Drink good tonight.

1:37:37.367 --> 1:37:38.668
Mm-hmm.
