WEBVTT

00:10.677 --> 00:12.512
Dad, why aren't you dressed?
It's 4:00 in the afternoon.

00:12.712 --> 00:14.247
Oh, I've been working nights.

00:14.247 --> 00:15.715
My body clock's off.

00:16.216 --> 00:17.784
I'm eating bacon
and eggs at night,

00:18.284 --> 00:19.786
and drinking beer
in the morning.

00:20.286 --> 00:21.588
That's what you always do.

00:21.588 --> 00:24.224
Yeah, but now I'm tired
all the time.

00:24.224 --> 00:25.558
There must
be some way

00:25.558 --> 00:28.061
to end this fight with your boss.

00:28.061 --> 00:29.396
What's the problem?

00:29.396 --> 00:32.232
Oh, he wants me to date
his sister, and I won't do it,

00:32.232 --> 00:34.067
so he's put me on graveyard until I cave.

00:34.334 --> 00:35.402
He can't do that.

00:35.402 --> 00:36.669
Why don't you file a complaint?

00:36.669 --> 00:39.706
I'd just as soon keep it
just between the two of us.

00:40.073 --> 00:41.574
I see. Is this woman
really so repulsive

00:41.574 --> 00:43.643
that you're willing
to sacrifice all your nights

00:43.643 --> 00:44.644
just to avoid
a date with her?

00:45.078 --> 00:46.646
Well, let me put it this way:

00:47.147 --> 00:50.150
Years of chewing tobacco
have discolored her tooth.

00:50.150 --> 00:51.017
(laughs)

00:53.319 --> 00:55.388
Someone left a book
of one-liners

00:55.388 --> 00:56.589
in the Lost and Found.

00:58.158 --> 00:59.726
Hey, Fras, there's
your friend again.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.227
MAN ( on TV ):
...have seen his top-rated show.

01:01.227 --> 01:03.596
Dr. Phil. Now meet
Dr. Phil McGraw in person.

01:03.930 --> 01:05.999
I'll be talking
about life strategies

01:05.999 --> 01:08.501
at the State Theater
Friday through Sunday.

01:08.501 --> 01:10.804
Come join us.
It might just change your life.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.406
Now, there's a doctor.

01:16.543 --> 01:18.778
I never knew you were friends
with Dr. Phil.

01:18.778 --> 01:20.280
Some years back,
we found ourselves

01:20.280 --> 01:24.284
running into each other
at seminars and conferences.

01:24.284 --> 01:27.787
He's an excellent therapist.

01:27.787 --> 01:31.325
We had a bit of a clash
over ethics.

01:31.758 --> 01:32.826
Oh, really?
Mm-hmm.

01:32.826 --> 01:35.228
What did you do,
sleep with a patient?

01:35.228 --> 01:37.130
Not my ethics. His.

01:37.630 --> 01:42.469
The man bilked me
out of $200 in a card game.

01:42.469 --> 01:43.736
He did not bilk you.

01:43.736 --> 01:45.305
It's called
a one-eyed jack.

01:45.305 --> 01:47.207
Oh, yes, yes,
there is one eye.

01:47.207 --> 01:49.642
But the other eye is there
by implication.

01:49.642 --> 01:52.645
Therefore, the hand
should have been a do-over.

01:52.645 --> 01:55.849
And you can ask Niles
about this, too.

01:55.849 --> 01:57.817
Far as I'm concerned,
the man owes me $200.

01:58.251 --> 01:59.319
This guy's so cheap,

01:59.319 --> 02:01.821
he could squeeze a nickel
till the buffalo chokes.

02:01.821 --> 02:02.722
(laughs)

02:07.560 --> 02:11.798
Dad, exactly how old
is this book of one-liners?

02:11.798 --> 02:12.632
How old?

02:12.632 --> 02:14.634
You're asking me how old?

02:14.634 --> 02:17.003
Well, I'll tell you how old.

02:17.303 --> 02:19.639
1956.

02:23.743 --> 02:25.245
Oh, Frasier,
Daphne told me

02:25.245 --> 02:27.313
all about Dr. Phil.
Oh.

02:27.313 --> 02:30.183
I can't believe
you know him.
Well...

02:30.183 --> 02:31.918
You think you could
get me in backstage?

02:32.218 --> 02:34.087
Roz, I really hadn't
planned on seeing him.

02:34.087 --> 02:35.555
Oh. Jealous, huh?

02:35.555 --> 02:38.057
Oh, it's okay, I understand.

02:38.057 --> 02:40.059
I am most certainly
not jealous.

02:40.059 --> 02:41.761
The man happens
to owe me $200.

02:41.761 --> 02:43.096
Right.

02:43.096 --> 02:45.098
But you know who
could help you

02:45.098 --> 02:46.533
with your jealousy?

02:46.900 --> 02:48.968
Dr. Phil.

02:51.304 --> 02:52.639
He'd be, like...

02:52.639 --> 02:56.643
"So your jealousy of me
has taken over your life.

02:56.643 --> 02:59.045
How's that working for you?"

02:59.045 --> 03:00.947
Yes.

03:00.947 --> 03:02.448
And I'd be, like...

03:02.949 --> 03:05.785
"Fine. My money, sir."

03:05.785 --> 03:07.120
Oh, please?

03:07.120 --> 03:08.922
Please do it for me? Please?

03:08.922 --> 03:09.756
Well...

03:10.256 --> 03:11.758
all right, all right.

03:11.758 --> 03:13.117
Oh, thank you.

03:13.117 --> 03:14.294
All right,
I'll see you at work.

03:14.761 --> 03:15.795
Yeah, okay.

03:15.795 --> 03:16.796
Here you go.
Oh.

03:16.796 --> 03:19.299
I couldn't remember if you
wanted it black or not,

03:19.299 --> 03:20.300
so I brought it
both ways.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.302
Well, that's very thoughtful of you.

03:22.302 --> 03:23.236
Thank you.

03:23.603 --> 03:25.171
No, you might as well keep it.

03:25.171 --> 03:26.639
You're paying for both.

03:26.639 --> 03:28.107
Hello.

03:28.107 --> 03:30.109
Oh, hi, Daph.

03:30.109 --> 03:31.611
Niles.
Hello.

03:31.611 --> 03:32.612
(gasps):
Oh, Nile
Mm-hmm?

03:33.112 --> 03:34.614
Look who's here.

03:34.614 --> 03:36.983
NILES:
Oh, isn't that adorable?

03:36.983 --> 03:38.318
See this couple?

03:38.318 --> 03:39.819
We-we've seen them
in the park a few times.

03:39.819 --> 03:40.820
They're so sweet together.

03:41.321 --> 03:43.223
We like to think they're us when we're older.

03:44.624 --> 03:45.959
Look how Old Niles

03:45.959 --> 03:48.828
still puts his jacket around
Old Daphne's shoulders.

03:50.263 --> 03:52.932
Ooh! She's still
a saucy little kitten.

03:53.166 --> 03:55.501
And I'll bet he still rolls overin the middle of the night...

03:55.501 --> 03:58.304
Yes, the picture is gotten.
Thank you.

03:58.304 --> 04:02.308
Oh, look. I think
I've found Old Frasier.

04:02.308 --> 04:04.110
Oh, yeah.

04:08.848 --> 04:10.350
I see.

04:10.350 --> 04:14.354
Well, I hope the two of you will
understand if, in future,

04:14.354 --> 04:16.856
I choose to knit scarves
only for myself.

04:16.856 --> 04:18.358
Come on, we were only joking.

04:18.358 --> 04:20.260
Yes, I know.
It's all in good fun.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.161
Oh, Niles, I just
remembered. I've got...

04:22.161 --> 04:25.031
Shut up!

04:25.031 --> 04:26.199
Excuse me?

04:26.199 --> 04:27.533
Shut up!

04:27.533 --> 04:29.302
We're trying to knit.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.709
(audience applauding)
ROZ:
Dr. Phil!

04:36.709 --> 04:37.910
Dr. Phil,
over here!

04:38.177 --> 04:39.712
Roz, please!

04:39.712 --> 04:43.249
At least attempt
to be cool

04:43.249 --> 04:45.151
Phil! Phil!

04:45.151 --> 04:47.887
Well, Frasier Crane,
is that you?

04:48.221 --> 04:50.223
Most assuredly

04:50.623 --> 04:51.691
Oh, that's
 you all right.

04:51.691 --> 04:52.692
So how are you?

04:53.192 --> 04:54.694
I'm fine, I'm fine.
How's Robin?

04:55.194 --> 04:56.696
She's great.
Can you believe it?

04:56.696 --> 04:58.197
We're going on 27 years.

04:58.197 --> 04:59.565
Oh, congratulations.

04:59.565 --> 05:00.833
And how's Lilith?

05:00.833 --> 05:04.537
Well, we've been divorced now for ten years.

05:04.537 --> 05:07.240
Congratulations.

05:07.540 --> 05:09.575
Hi. I'm Roz Doyle.
Oh, I'm sorry. Yes.

05:09.575 --> 05:10.576
I'm Frasier's producer.

05:11.077 --> 05:12.111
I just think you're wonderful.

05:12.111 --> 05:14.614
I think your show is great,
and you're a truly wise man.

05:14.614 --> 05:17.085
Do you know Tom Hanks?

05:17.750 --> 05:19.752
Uh... no, but thanks
for the compliment.

05:20.186 --> 05:21.754
Y'all come on through.

05:21.754 --> 05:23.256
Oh, thank you.
Thanks.

05:23.256 --> 05:24.257
Come on.

05:24.757 --> 05:26.259
So, Frasier,
how's your show?

05:26.259 --> 05:27.760
Oh, huge,
thank you.

05:27.760 --> 05:30.029
We just added Spokane
last year.

05:30.229 --> 05:32.265
And a station in Saint Paul

05:32.265 --> 05:35.768
has agreed to let me
send them a tape.

05:35.768 --> 05:37.737
Can you believe,
after all that time

05:37.737 --> 05:38.738
we spent in the seminars,

05:39.238 --> 05:41.174
that we both turned out
to be broadcasters?

05:41.174 --> 05:44.110
Boy, those were
some good times,
weren't they?

05:44.110 --> 05:45.545
Oh, indeed
they were.

05:45.912 --> 05:49.482
Although sometimes
the fun and games...

05:49.482 --> 05:51.317
were lacking in fun.

05:51.551 --> 05:54.921
Are you still whining
about that 200 bucks?

05:54.921 --> 05:56.756
Well, it's the principle
of the thing...

05:56.756 --> 05:58.257
I tell you what,
I tell you what.

05:58.257 --> 05:59.759
Why don't we just
discuss it over dinner?

05:59.759 --> 06:01.027
Love to.
Can't.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.796
I am so busy--
personal appearances,

06:03.796 --> 06:06.299
and book signings,
and interviews--

06:06.299 --> 06:09.769
I've got this agent
that's got me going 25/8

06:09.769 --> 06:12.271
In fact, speak
of the devil,
here she comes

06:12.772 --> 06:14.273
Phil, darling!

06:14.273 --> 06:17.744
Oh! That was sensational!

06:18.144 --> 06:19.011
Bebe?

06:20.313 --> 06:21.681
Frasier!

06:23.516 --> 06:25.952
And Roz, too.

06:26.319 --> 06:27.720
You guys know each other?

06:27.987 --> 06:29.021
She's my agent.

06:29.021 --> 06:29.822
And she used
to be mine.

06:30.156 --> 06:31.724
Phil, there's a swarm
of reporters

06:31.724 --> 06:34.060
in your dressing room
waiting to talk to you.

06:34.293 --> 06:36.329
I probably should be going, actually

06:36.329 --> 06:38.865
But, Roz, it was really nice to meet you.

06:38.865 --> 06:39.832
And Frasier,

06:39.832 --> 06:41.267
tell you what,
let's do e-mail.

06:41.667 --> 06:42.602
Okay.

06:44.470 --> 06:46.239
Isn't
he marvelous?

06:46.239 --> 06:47.507
He's a cowboy...

06:48.007 --> 06:51.010
wrapped in a genius,
wrapped in a dream...

06:51.010 --> 06:54.013
wrapped in another cowboy.

06:54.013 --> 06:56.516
I cannot believe
that I have

06:56.516 --> 06:58.518
the same agent as Dr. Phil!

06:58.518 --> 07:00.019
Actually, you don't.

07:00.019 --> 07:02.955
Somebody as big as Dr. Phil
needs all of my attention,

07:02.955 --> 07:05.858
but rest assured, you are being handled ably

07:05.858 --> 07:08.828
by an agent in whom I have the utmost confidence.

07:08.828 --> 07:10.696
Who is it?

07:10.997 --> 07:12.999
I want to say Tim...

07:13.366 --> 07:14.934
I think I need
 to make a phone call.

07:14.934 --> 07:15.868
Yeah.

07:16.869 --> 07:18.871
So, Bebe...
(chuckles)

07:18.871 --> 07:22.675
however did
you land Dr. Phil?

07:22.875 --> 07:24.444
We met about a year ago

07:24.944 --> 07:27.280
at a charity
donkey basketball game.

07:27.547 --> 07:30.082
Donkey basketball?

07:30.082 --> 07:31.551
Texas, darling.

07:31.551 --> 07:34.053
It's like the symphony to them

07:35.555 --> 07:36.889
Long story short,

07:37.156 --> 07:38.724
I gave him some advice

07:38.724 --> 07:40.993
and, finally,
he hired me full-time.

07:41.227 --> 07:42.161
Well, congratulations.

07:42.161 --> 07:43.529
You can't imagine

07:43.529 --> 07:45.531
the connections
I have these days.

07:45.531 --> 07:46.866
If only you and I had...

07:48.334 --> 07:50.903
Well...

07:51.404 --> 07:53.906
that's water under the bridge, I guess.

07:53.906 --> 07:55.908
It's fun catching up, but...

07:55.908 --> 07:57.910
Phil's interviewing stylists for the Emmys.

07:57.910 --> 07:59.378
Bye, Frasier.

08:03.382 --> 08:05.218
What a phony, huh?

08:06.552 --> 08:09.055
She used to be my phony.

08:12.992 --> 08:15.661
Dad, do you think I did
the right thing changing agents?

08:15.661 --> 08:17.129
I mean the one
I have now is fine,

08:17.129 --> 08:19.665
but after I've seen
what Bebe's done for Phil,

08:19.665 --> 08:21.167
I can't help wondering

08:21.167 --> 08:23.603
if maybe I've denied myself access to a wider world.

08:26.739 --> 08:28.608
Dad, are you all right?

08:28.608 --> 08:29.942
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:29.942 --> 08:32.445
I... I haven't talked
to anybody for a few days.

08:32.445 --> 08:34.947
It feels kind of strange.

08:34.947 --> 08:38.217
Even this is making me
a little uncomfortable.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.020
Dad, you have got to stop
with the graveyard shifts

08:42.020 --> 08:44.023
or you're going to start
seeing apparitions.

08:44.023 --> 08:46.025
No, don't worry about me. I'm pretty tough.

08:46.025 --> 08:48.027
Listen, I'd love to stay here talking to you,

08:48.427 --> 08:50.930
but all this sunlight
is making me dizzy.

08:50.930 --> 08:53.232
What, you don't like the sun?

08:53.232 --> 08:56.102
Us night-shift guys call it...

08:56.102 --> 08:57.803
"The Scare-Ball."

08:59.138 --> 09:02.141
(doorbell rings)

09:09.148 --> 09:10.483
Oh, Bebe.

09:10.483 --> 09:11.784
Hello, darling.

09:11.784 --> 09:14.587
I can across this old box
of Frasier strategy memos,

09:14.820 --> 09:17.390
and I thought
I'd bring them by to you.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.825
Gosh, I... I didn't realize there was so much.

09:19.825 --> 09:22.161
And you thought I didn't work hard.

09:22.461 --> 09:24.030
Now, now, there's no reason to take that tone.

09:24.030 --> 09:26.332
Things have certainly worked out
for you, wouldn't you say?

09:26.332 --> 09:27.667
Too true.

09:27.667 --> 09:32.004
But... I can't be blamed for being a bit of a bitter Bebe.

09:32.004 --> 09:34.340
No one likes
being tossed aside for a younger woman.

09:34.340 --> 09:35.841
Oh, Bebe,
you know very well

09:35.841 --> 09:37.310
I only changed agents

09:37.310 --> 09:39.845
because you were ignoring me
in favor of another client.

09:39.845 --> 09:41.347
I wasn't ignoring you,

09:41.347 --> 09:43.849
I was merely getting
some much-needed
critical distance

09:43.849 --> 09:46.719
for a final glorious
Frasierian push!

09:48.888 --> 09:51.557
But let's not rehash the past.

09:51.857 --> 09:52.925
Agreed.

09:52.925 --> 09:54.927
We accomplished
too much together

09:54.927 --> 09:57.330
to stop
being friends now.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.198
True.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.201
Frasier...

10:02.201 --> 10:05.204
have you ever wondered
what it would be like...

10:05.204 --> 10:07.707
if I could apply
what I've learned...

10:08.207 --> 10:09.709
to you?

10:09.709 --> 10:12.178
Yes, I have.

10:12.178 --> 10:15.181
But it cannot be.

10:15.681 --> 10:16.616
Can it?

10:18.551 --> 10:20.553
Dangerous thoughts.

10:20.553 --> 10:22.555
You're a siren...

10:22.555 --> 10:24.957
luring me to the rocks.

10:24.957 --> 10:26.392
But I must resist,

10:26.392 --> 10:28.394
or you'll hurt me again.

10:28.394 --> 10:29.395
No, I'm no siren!

10:29.395 --> 10:31.731
I'm a man!
A man with ambitions!

10:31.731 --> 10:33.566
Ambition!

10:33.566 --> 10:37.570
The word is candy to me.

10:37.570 --> 10:39.572
Damn you, devil man!

10:39.572 --> 10:42.074
I must go!

10:42.074 --> 10:44.076
I'm all confused and woozy!

10:44.076 --> 10:45.344
I understand!

10:45.344 --> 10:47.113
But what
about me?!

10:47.113 --> 10:48.114
Very well.

10:48.614 --> 10:52.118
Be at my hotel
tonight for dinner.

10:52.118 --> 10:57.456
Perhaps you'll show me
just how serious you are.

10:59.000 --> 11:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:06.799 --> 11:08.300
I think I've
figured it out.

11:08.300 --> 11:09.802
Bebe wants to have sex
with a human male

11:10.302 --> 11:11.804
to bring about
the apocalypse.

11:14.206 --> 11:17.076
Perhaps.

11:17.076 --> 11:19.078
But here's my theory:

11:19.078 --> 11:22.448
Bebe's had a thing for me for years.
 Mm-hmm.

11:22.715 --> 11:24.283
This, coupled with the fact

11:24.283 --> 11:26.786
that control is
an aphrodisiac for her,

11:26.786 --> 11:29.288
it's not surprising to find that she hopes

11:29.288 --> 11:34.927
to parlay her advantage
into a sexual conquest.

11:34.927 --> 11:37.430
the promise of wealth
and exposure

11:37.430 --> 11:38.698
lure you
into her bed?

11:38.698 --> 11:40.466
It's not going to come to that

11:40.966 --> 11:42.368
It's all about the dance

11:43.669 --> 11:47.139
It's all about the possibility of sex-- the promise--

11:47.139 --> 11:50.142
that's never delivered
that keeps them tantalized.

11:50.643 --> 11:53.646
One only needs to know
how not to cross the line.

11:53.646 --> 11:57.049
Excuse me, but didn't
you sleep with her once?

11:58.451 --> 12:01.721
Yes. That's how I know
where the line is.

12:05.091 --> 12:07.159
I almost feel sorry for her.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.662
Just another helpless woman

12:09.662 --> 12:12.631
suffering from
an unslakable thirst...

12:13.099 --> 12:15.668
For Crane.
for Crane.

12:19.171 --> 12:20.673
Still, I can't
help thinking

12:20.673 --> 12:23.175
there's something
Faustian about
this whole thing.

12:23.676 --> 12:27.179
(chuckling):
Faust was a moron.

12:27.179 --> 12:31.183
I'm going to be a star.

12:31.183 --> 12:33.152
Hi, Daph.

12:33.152 --> 12:34.186
Hello.

12:34.186 --> 12:35.688
A latte, please.

12:35.688 --> 12:36.689
Hello, darling.

12:36.689 --> 12:37.690
Hello.

12:37.690 --> 12:39.191
Did you see who's here?

12:39.191 --> 12:40.126
Yes.

12:41.861 --> 12:44.697
I wonder if you'll still be stirring my coffee like that

12:44.697 --> 12:46.599
when we're in our golden years.
Yes.

12:46.599 --> 12:49.034
And I know that a touch
from you then

12:49.034 --> 12:51.437
will be just as sweet
as it is today.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.873
So this is where
you've been going!

12:54.373 --> 12:56.876
And with this tramp
from water aerobics!

12:58.344 --> 12:59.411
Who are you?

12:59.411 --> 13:00.412
I'm his wife.

13:00.412 --> 13:01.814
You're married?

13:01.814 --> 13:03.048
I can explain.

13:03.048 --> 13:04.884
Don't bother, you worm!

13:04.884 --> 13:08.888
You promised that was it the last time.

13:15.895 --> 13:18.397
(knocking on door)

13:18.397 --> 13:20.900
Frasier, come in.

13:21.400 --> 13:22.902
(distant choir singing)

13:22.902 --> 13:24.370
How did you know it was me?

13:24.370 --> 13:28.274
I felt a certain
tingle in the knob.

13:28.574 --> 13:30.075
Indeed.

13:32.111 --> 13:35.581
Well, I see Phil
has landed you

13:35.581 --> 13:37.583
in the lap of luxury.

13:37.583 --> 13:39.084
Yes, it's a lovely suite.

13:39.084 --> 13:41.086
Unfortunately,
there's some sort

13:41.086 --> 13:43.022
of choir championship
this weekend,

13:43.389 --> 13:45.758
and they practice at all hours.

13:46.058 --> 13:48.127
Is it Madrigal Madness
already?

13:48.127 --> 13:51.030
I had no idea it was
this close to Whitsun.

13:51.397 --> 13:53.432
Please, darling, sit.

13:53.432 --> 13:55.434
I'll pour the champagne.

13:55.434 --> 13:58.470
Well, I... I suppose a drop wouldn't hurt.

14:01.473 --> 14:03.976
So... have you given any thought

14:03.976 --> 14:05.811
to taking me on again?

14:05.811 --> 14:08.113
Yes, I have.

14:08.113 --> 14:12.418
And I have to say there's almost nothing I'd enjoy more.

14:12.618 --> 14:14.119
Wonderful.

14:14.119 --> 14:15.120
But first...

14:15.120 --> 14:19.191
let's talk about
what I'd enjoy more.

14:20.492 --> 14:22.228
You want more than ten percent?

14:22.228 --> 14:23.629
I want you.

14:23.629 --> 14:26.131
And yes
to the other thing.

14:28.801 --> 14:30.736
Gosh, Bebe...

14:31.070 --> 14:32.638
I'm-I'm terribly flattered.

14:32.638 --> 14:33.639
It-it's just that, um...

14:33.639 --> 14:35.140
Frasier.
Hmm?

14:35.140 --> 14:38.143
A few years ago I let down my guard

14:38.143 --> 14:39.545
and succumbed to your advances.

14:39.545 --> 14:40.913
You seduced me.

14:41.280 --> 14:42.314
It changed me, Frasier.

14:42.815 --> 14:46.185
If I crave your touch again,
you've only yourself to blame.

14:46.185 --> 14:48.754
I'm not going to say that
you're not a beautiful woman.

14:48.954 --> 14:52.925
But is it wise for us
to jump into a relationship?

14:52.925 --> 14:55.828
I'm only talking about having a little fun.

14:55.828 --> 14:59.832
After all, when I'm having fun, I'm happy.

14:59.832 --> 15:02.835
When I'm happy, I work harder.

15:03.335 --> 15:05.838
When I work harder, you become famous

15:05.838 --> 15:07.339
and rich and powerful.

15:07.840 --> 15:11.110
That's what you
want, isn't it-- fame and power?

15:11.343 --> 15:13.913
Well, I... I like
to think of it

15:13.913 --> 15:16.215
more as influence,
really, but...

15:16.215 --> 15:19.852
I'll bet I can make you bigger than Dr. Phil.

15:20.152 --> 15:22.187
Is that running
water I hear?

15:22.621 --> 15:25.658
Yes. I'm steaming the wrinkles out of a dress.

15:25.658 --> 15:28.627
Does it put you in mind
of a tropic night...

15:31.030 --> 15:33.065
...a moonlit stroll,

15:33.565 --> 15:36.068
the rhythmic
lapping of waves

15:36.068 --> 15:38.037
against the shore?

15:38.037 --> 15:41.907
You know, if it's silk,
the steam could damage it.

15:41.907 --> 15:44.221
Wait right here.

15:44.221 --> 15:46.879
.
I'd better open a window

15:46.879 --> 15:48.347
Yes, darling.

15:48.347 --> 15:50.382
Let the night in

15:50.382 --> 15:53.719
while I slip into something a little more comfortable

15:53.719 --> 15:57.523
Well, if you want comfortable,
how about that sweater ensemble

15:57.523 --> 16:00.025
I saw you in this morning?

16:00.025 --> 16:02.895
(choir singing ominous tune )

16:04.730 --> 16:06.098
Bebe?

16:06.098 --> 16:07.900
Join me, Frasier.

16:07.900 --> 16:11.403
I'll make your dreams
come true.

16:11.403 --> 16:16.742
But... at what cost?

16:16.976 --> 16:19.478
What I'm offering you
is priceless.

16:19.845 --> 16:21.413
Come, Frasier.

16:21.413 --> 16:24.416
(ominous tune intensifies)

16:27.886 --> 16:29.221
FRASIER:
I can't!

16:29.421 --> 16:31.991
(yelling)

16:31.991 --> 16:33.392
(shrieks)

16:38.197 --> 16:40.265
(sighs heavily)

16:49.108 --> 16:50.609
( dings )

16:57.282 --> 16:59.218
(chuckles softly)

17:04.423 --> 17:06.191
(whirring)

17:22.674 --> 17:25.644
(whirring)

17:32.651 --> 17:35.154
(imitates sizzling)

17:37.089 --> 17:40.659
Roger. You are go for liftoff.

17:40.659 --> 17:43.162
Godspeed, Martin Six.

17:50.669 --> 17:52.171
(microwave dings)

17:52.171 --> 17:53.539
Oh!

17:53.806 --> 17:55.340
Aah!

18:07.186 --> 18:09.688
What the hell's going on?

18:09.688 --> 18:10.656
Oh, geez.

18:11.190 --> 18:12.691
Just sort of a...

18:12.691 --> 18:15.194
a... minor accident here.

18:15.194 --> 18:16.695
But don't worry about it

18:16.695 --> 18:18.163
Everything's under control

18:26.705 --> 18:29.675
So, what time you want me
to pick up your sister?

18:32.211 --> 18:34.680
Well, if it isn't the First Couple of radio.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.615
I knew I could find you here.

18:37.015 --> 18:39.084
Bebe, shouldn't you be
in Los Angeles with Dr. Phil?

18:39.585 --> 18:40.552
That's up
to you, Frasier.

18:40.552 --> 18:43.055
I don't understand.

18:43.055 --> 18:47.059
Well, after our.
.. meeting last night

18:47.059 --> 18:49.027
I had to ask myself a very difficult question:

18:49.394 --> 18:52.464
Am I really that happy
with Dr. Phil

18:52.464 --> 18:55.267
if I'm entertaining thoughts of returning to you?

18:55.267 --> 18:57.002
Are you saying
you'll have me back?

18:57.002 --> 18:58.370
How could I refuse you?

18:58.370 --> 18:59.805
Dr. Phil has been amusing,

18:59.805 --> 19:02.207
but I need a project.

19:02.207 --> 19:03.976
I need a Frasier Crane.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.744
Well, that's...
that's wonderful.

19:05.744 --> 19:08.647
Incidentally,
Dr. Phil paid me 15%.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.549
Well, as will Dr. Frasier.

19:10.549 --> 19:12.551
I've just got one
very difficult call

19:12.551 --> 19:14.052
to make to my agent.

19:14.052 --> 19:14.920
Already handled.

19:15.354 --> 19:16.922
I also took the liberty
of calling Spokane.

19:16.922 --> 19:19.258
The terms of your deal there
were worse than abysmal.

19:19.591 --> 19:21.460
Great. Great.
You got me more money!

19:21.460 --> 19:23.262
No, they wouldn't budge,
so you quit.

19:23.262 --> 19:25.697
You're no longer on in Spokane. Isn't that exciting?

19:26.064 --> 19:26.932
Wait a minute.

19:26.932 --> 19:28.200
That is a step backwards.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.903
All the better
to get a running start.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.471
In my opinion,

19:32.471 --> 19:36.241
the future is firmly
in front of us.

19:36.675 --> 19:37.743
Congratulations,
Frasier.

19:37.743 --> 19:40.245
Oh, thank you, Bebe.
Thank you so much.

19:40.245 --> 19:41.747
I'll call you tomorrow.

19:42.247 --> 19:43.115
I'll be waiting.

19:43.115 --> 19:44.950
Gosh! Roz, isn'’t that great news?

19:44.950 --> 19:47.452
I feel like a weight
has been lifted from me.

19:47.452 --> 19:48.787
Oh, it's marvelous!

19:49.121 --> 19:51.690
She's charging you more money, and we just lost Spokane.

19:51.690 --> 19:56.461
Big picture: the future is firmly in front of me.

19:56.795 --> 19:59.264
Isn't the future
always in front of you?

19:59.264 --> 20:03.135
Yes... but not firmly.

20:07.606 --> 20:08.540
Well, my little lamb

20:08.540 --> 20:10.609
has bleated his way back to me

20:12.778 --> 20:13.845
So my debt i

20:13.845 --> 20:15.847
We don't have to keep
pretending you're my agent?

20:15.847 --> 20:17.316
We're square, darling.

20:17.816 --> 20:19.818
And maybe next time
you gamble with Bebe...

20:19.818 --> 20:22.321
you'll pay your debts
with cash.

20:22.321 --> 20:23.822
See, the problem is,

20:23.822 --> 20:25.824
my wife looks
at the bank statements,

20:25.824 --> 20:28.827
and if she knew I was
losing money playing cards,

20:28.827 --> 20:30.662
she would kill me.

20:30.662 --> 20:35.000
So, your wife doesn't know you play poker?

20:35.000 --> 20:37.502
I don't tell her everything.

20:37.502 --> 20:38.837
I see.

20:39.104 --> 20:42.975
And how's that
working for you?

20:43.175 --> 20:45.544
Just deal the cards.
