00:12.640 --> 00:14.040
I'm Fred Sirieix.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.720
I've worked
in the restaurant industry
for 25 years.

00:16.760 --> 00:21.120
Right now, the UK's restaurant
scene is the envy of the world.

00:21.160 --> 00:27.360
And all it takes
is one great idea to make
a fortune on the high street.

00:27.400 --> 00:30.760
But has the next generation
of restaurants
got what it takes

00:30.800 --> 00:33.840
to become a multi-million
pound business?

00:33.880 --> 00:38.600
Over the next six weeks,
here in Manchester,
the food capital of the North,

00:38.640 --> 00:41.600
12 of the most exciting
new restaurant ideas

00:41.640 --> 00:44.360
are in with a chance of a
life-changing investment

00:44.400 --> 00:48.000
from some of the UK's most
respected investors.

00:48.040 --> 00:52.840
These are the men and women
who can turn an idea
into a national brand.

00:52.880 --> 00:56.800
We're looking at putting a lot
of money into the absolute
best concept.

00:56.840 --> 00:59.240
This is the kind of model that
you dream of.

00:59.280 --> 01:04.600
If I find the right operator,
I'll be fighting for it.

01:04.640 --> 01:07.400
[Fred] Each week,
the investors will give
the people

01:07.440 --> 01:10.920
behind two
great new food ideas
a unique opportunity.

01:10.960 --> 01:12.400
Ah, this is brilliant.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.800
-[Fred]
Their own pop-up restaurant.
-[bell dings]

01:14.840 --> 01:16.000
Right. Rock and roll, man.

01:16.040 --> 01:18.000
[Fred] They have just three
days to prove...

01:18.040 --> 01:19.800
Nobody seems to know
the table numbers.

01:19.840 --> 01:22.440
-[Fred]
They've got what it takes...
-It's a disaster.

01:22.480 --> 01:24.240
[Fred]
To make it on the high street.

01:24.280 --> 01:27.040
When you start to rush,
that's when you start
to make more mistakes.

01:27.080 --> 01:29.160
-There's a big backlog
of customers...
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:29.200 --> 01:30.840
What are you going
to do about it?

01:30.880 --> 01:34.760
If I was to invest,
it would take half a million
to £750,000.

01:34.800 --> 01:37.160
Time to make some dough.

01:37.200 --> 01:41.560
[Fred] After the 3 days,
will the investors walk back
into the restaurant...

01:41.600 --> 01:43.000
[sighs]

01:43.040 --> 01:44.400
[Fred]
And make them an offer?

01:44.440 --> 01:46.320
It's a £600,000 lunch.

01:46.360 --> 01:49.360
We are not gonna leave
without an investment.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.280
I'm sorry. Your time is up.

01:51.320 --> 01:52.960
The doors are open
for business.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.680
Welcome to Million Pound Menu.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.800
You know what they say
about first impressions?

02:01.840 --> 02:03.560
Well, it's all true.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.240
Speak to
a restaurant investor,

02:05.280 --> 02:08.480
and they'll tell you the
first bite of their food
is everything.

02:08.520 --> 02:12.200
Over 1,300 restaurants opened
last year in the UK.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.920
Today, two more will be
opened for business,

02:14.960 --> 02:19.240
hoping they've got what it
takes to make a fortune in
the restaurant business.

02:19.280 --> 02:21.520
Always, always, wanted to own
my own restaurant.

02:21.560 --> 02:24.160
On our social media accounts,
all our reviews are
five stars.

02:25.480 --> 02:27.240
[narrator]
The men and women
behind some of the UK's

02:27.280 --> 02:30.200
most successful
high-street businesses

02:30.240 --> 02:33.720
met to choose the most
exciting new restaurant ideas

02:33.760 --> 02:35.920
for a three-day
trial run pop-up.

02:36.960 --> 02:38.440
[woman]
Raastawala is fun.

02:38.480 --> 02:40.600
It's that bubbliness that
we're trying to bring through

02:40.640 --> 02:42.600
in our presentation,
in our food.

02:42.640 --> 02:45.880
It's the profit per site
going to be big enough

02:45.920 --> 02:48.360
for people like ourselves
to invest?

02:48.400 --> 02:51.800
[narrator] They were looking
for the two entrepreneurs
with the strongest food,

02:51.840 --> 02:54.600
brand, and business plan.

02:54.640 --> 02:57.360
This is our signature dish,
braised beef ragu

02:57.400 --> 02:59.200
I think there are other
players in the market already

02:59.240 --> 03:01.360
who are doing it
in a more authentic way.

03:01.400 --> 03:05.920
[narrator] Then, each investor
had to decide whether they
liked either idea enough

03:05.960 --> 03:07.800
to try it in Manchester.

03:10.680 --> 03:14.600
We are Naked Dough.
Let's get naked!

03:14.640 --> 03:17.600
[narrator]
The first idea to
whet their appetite,

03:17.640 --> 03:22.800
two best friends who think
Britain's ready for the
latest American sweet craze,

03:22.840 --> 03:24.600
raw cookie dough.

03:24.640 --> 03:29.600
[Jen] We are all about bringing
fun, indulgent treats
to the UK market.

03:29.640 --> 03:34.120
In the first three months,
we had a turnover
of £150,000.

03:34.160 --> 03:36.600
[Hannah]
That's a lot of dough.
[Jen] It's a lot of dough.

03:36.640 --> 03:40.440
[narrator] Hannah and Jen
are after £250,000

03:40.480 --> 03:43.960
to take Naked Dough
nation-wide and beyond.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.400
We're looking
for a sweet-toothed investor

03:46.440 --> 03:50.400
to help us grow
and become a global brand.

03:50.440 --> 03:55.440
Uh, I think this is fantastic.
I actually started my career
working in Millie's Cookies.

03:55.480 --> 03:57.040
[laughter]

03:57.080 --> 03:59.400
My name's Chris Miller.
I run a company called
White Rabbit,

03:59.440 --> 04:02.800
which is a hospitality
investment fund.

04:02.840 --> 04:05.560
The ability
to scale this is huge.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.800
Obviously, like,
the retail side of it,
the kiosks,

04:08.840 --> 04:10.280
the standalone sites.

04:10.320 --> 04:12.320
At the moment,
it's just cookie dough,

04:12.360 --> 04:15.360
but, actually, they could
use it as a base
for ice creams.

04:15.400 --> 04:18.320
They could do actual
baked cookies.

04:18.360 --> 04:21.000
It's actually finding a way
to... How can you expand

04:21.040 --> 04:23.440
the initial brand
that they've created.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.560
[Jamie]
Potentially this is genius.

04:25.600 --> 04:28.560
This is the kind of model that
you dream of.

04:28.600 --> 04:32.240
I'm Jamie Barber, and I've
been in the restaurant
business now for 20 years.

04:32.280 --> 04:34.600
Traditional restaurants are
very expensive.

04:34.640 --> 04:36.280
You look at something
like Naked Dough...

04:36.320 --> 04:39.400
I don't think they need
a full-scale store.

04:39.440 --> 04:41.760
The labor costs should
be pretty small.

04:41.800 --> 04:44.520
There's no
high-level chefs required.

04:44.560 --> 04:47.880
I see this as being a
concession that can be
popped into

04:47.920 --> 04:51.640
a River Island or
a Topshop or a cinema.

04:51.680 --> 04:53.880
[Shruti]
I absolutely love this.

04:53.920 --> 04:58.040
Their branding is super
strong. You can't help
but be attracted by it.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.400
It's a really original concept.

04:59.440 --> 05:01.320
I can't think of a single place
it wouldn't work.

05:01.360 --> 05:03.880
I can't think of a single
person who wouldn't
want to eat it.

05:03.920 --> 05:06.360
I'm Shruti and I do
angel investing,

05:06.400 --> 05:09.560
so I invest my own personal
money in small businesses.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.440
My first ever investment was
in a restaurant business.

05:12.480 --> 05:16.240
I think the restaurant sector
is actually quite difficult
at the moment,

05:16.280 --> 05:20.320
and I think that's one of the
reasons why Naked Dough
really appeals to me.

05:20.360 --> 05:21.880
I absolutely
love the branding.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.160
I can imagine it would
very much appeal
to my two-year- old,

05:24.200 --> 05:25.840
five-year-old and
seven-year-old.

05:25.880 --> 05:28.360
I'm absolutely all over this
like a bad rash.

05:28.400 --> 05:29.520
[all laughing]

05:32.440 --> 05:35.320
Hey guys, Liz and Stew here
from Black Bear Burger.

05:35.360 --> 05:38.680
[narrator] Next, a married
couple who want a piece
of the UK's

05:38.720 --> 05:42.280
three billion pound
burger market.

05:42.320 --> 05:45.360
[Liz]
Our concept with Black Bear
is simple done well.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.480
We don't use any gimmicks
in our burger,

05:47.520 --> 05:50.800
we just use the best
ingredients to create
a great burger.

05:50.840 --> 05:53.400
[Stew] Since we started
trading a Broadway market,

05:53.440 --> 05:57.080
our reputation is now one
of the best burgers
in London.

05:57.120 --> 06:00.280
[narrator]
Liz and Stew are
after £200,000

06:00.320 --> 06:02.560
to open their first proper
restaurant.

06:06.880 --> 06:09.400
-Looks good.
-Do we need another
burger operator?

06:09.440 --> 06:12.160
It doesn't really matter
whether the market is
saturated or not.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.680
If you're entering it
and you've got a better offer,
a better price,

06:14.720 --> 06:17.040
you'll kill the opposition.
Absolutely kill the opposition.

06:17.080 --> 06:20.360
I mean, I'm always keen
to check out any rising
talent

06:20.400 --> 06:22.800
and just reaffirm
our position, really.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.640
You think I'll be sick of
burgers by now, but I'm not.

06:25.680 --> 06:29.400
I'm Scott Collins, co-founder
and managing director
of MEATliquor.

06:29.440 --> 06:32.320
The whole burger phenomenon,
people want a bit more...

06:32.360 --> 06:35.800
bang for their buck and
a bit more of experience
nowadays, so...

06:35.840 --> 06:37.640
that's why
I think we prospered.

06:37.680 --> 06:39.520
It's not just about
the burger.

06:39.560 --> 06:43.960
It is a fairly crowded market,
so it does have to have
an X factor.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.720
So, from our perspective,
we'd quite like to see
a burger operator

06:46.760 --> 06:48.760
in our, er...
in our property.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.680
And we think it would fit
very well.

06:50.720 --> 06:54.760
I'm Tim Gee
from Allied London.
Property development business.

06:54.800 --> 06:57.360
It looks unhealthy,
it's going to taste delicious.

06:57.400 --> 07:00.120
I think burgers are a great
product, always will be.

07:00.160 --> 07:02.440
If you've got
the right product,
the right brand,

07:02.480 --> 07:05.680
the right location,
they'll sell very, very well.

07:05.720 --> 07:08.040
[narrator]
The ideas have been chosen.

07:08.080 --> 07:11.440
Black Bear Burger have two
investors interested,

07:11.480 --> 07:15.160
but three might end up
competing over Naked Dough.

07:25.800 --> 07:27.400
[Fred]
Naked Dough
and Black Bear Burger

07:27.440 --> 07:29.840
will open their doors
for the first time today.

07:29.880 --> 07:33.960
In 24 hours, some of the
country's biggest
restaurant investors

07:34.000 --> 07:37.960
will arrive
and look at their business
in every detail.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.080
Will they walk away
with an investment,
or empty-handed?

07:42.120 --> 07:46.720
[narrator] For the next three
days, both ideas will take
over existing restaurant sites

07:46.760 --> 07:49.160
just 100 yards apart.

07:49.200 --> 07:54.640
Today, Liz and Stew, and Jen
and Hannah will see their
restaurants for the first time.

07:55.320 --> 07:56.760
[Stew] Oh, no way! Look!

07:56.800 --> 07:58.240
[narrator]
For the past few weeks,

07:58.280 --> 08:00.560
they've been working
with a designer...

08:00.600 --> 08:01.840
Let's have a little look.

08:01.880 --> 08:03.640
[narrator]
To bring their brands
to life.

08:06.320 --> 08:09.520
[Liz] Oh, wow! Amazing!
[Stew] Oh, my God!

08:09.560 --> 08:11.600
[Liz] It's amazing!
[Stew] It's wicked.

08:11.640 --> 08:13.040
It's perfect.

08:13.080 --> 08:15.160
[Stew] Just our vibe,
actually.
[Liz] Yeah, totally.

08:15.760 --> 08:17.720
That's awesome.

08:17.760 --> 08:19.400
Right, need to see
this kitchen.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.640
[narrator] Newlyweds
Liz and Stew got together
at university.

08:26.680 --> 08:30.280
The girls in our flat
had a competition as to who
could with him first.

08:30.320 --> 08:31.680
Cheers, mate.

08:31.720 --> 08:36.840
I wooed her over with, um,
with my love of my cow.

08:36.880 --> 08:38.800
I live on a beef farm down
at Devon.

08:38.840 --> 08:41.040
I've got this favorite cow
called Cow 74.

08:41.080 --> 08:45.600
When I saw Cow 74, Stew's
favorite cow, I think
that was when I fell in love.

08:45.640 --> 08:48.560
-[laughs]
-It's how to charm a lady.

08:48.600 --> 08:51.160
[narrator]
After working in
Canada for two years,

08:51.200 --> 08:56.240
they took the plunge and set
up Black Bear Burger
18 months ago.

08:56.280 --> 09:00.680
This is the Black Bear Burger,
no gimmick, just done well.

09:00.720 --> 09:04.280
-[laughing] What was it?
-Just a great burger.

09:04.320 --> 09:07.080
Whilst we were there,
we sort of had, like, a bit
of an epiphany, really,

09:07.120 --> 09:08.880
we were like actually,
when we get home,

09:08.920 --> 09:11.880
we should do something
that we really,
really wanna do.

09:11.920 --> 09:13.960
And that's when we set up
Black Bear.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.480
[narrator] Their burgers have
sold so well, their food stall
has gone full-time.

09:18.520 --> 09:20.560
[Liz] Our focus is simple,
done well.

09:20.600 --> 09:22.960
That's always at the center
of Black Bear.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.960
Let's get crackin'.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.520
[narrator] Opposite Black
Bear Burger, best friends
Jen and Hannah are also

09:29.560 --> 09:31.840
about to see their restaurant
for the first time.

09:33.280 --> 09:34.920
-So exciting!
-So exciting.

09:34.960 --> 09:36.840
We got a logo!

09:36.880 --> 09:40.440
-Ooh, oh, my God!
-Oh, my God!

09:40.480 --> 09:43.560
[Jen] Good times in the Naked
Dough restaurant.

09:43.600 --> 09:46.760
[narrator] 33-year-old Jen
trained as a pastry chef.

09:46.800 --> 09:49.680
-I love all the artwork
on the wall.
-Yeah.

09:49.720 --> 09:53.440
[narrator]
And 25-year-old Hannah
gave up her job in marketing

09:53.480 --> 09:56.480
to launch Naked Dough five
months ago.

09:56.520 --> 10:01.720
Hannah and I have talked
about various business ideas.

10:01.760 --> 10:05.240
She's mainly come up with some
crazy, fun-angled idea.

10:05.280 --> 10:08.360
Honestly, I came up with the
weirdest ideas. I was like,
"This is it, this is it,

10:08.400 --> 10:10.400
this is going to make
us millions."

10:10.440 --> 10:15.360
But when I saw that cookie
dough was a new craze
in America,

10:15.400 --> 10:18.840
and people were queuing for
three hours at a time
just to eat some

10:18.880 --> 10:22.360
chocolate-chip cookie dough,
I was like,
"Ah! Brilliant!

10:22.400 --> 10:23.520
Let's do that in London."

10:25.760 --> 10:27.880
[narrator]
Last year, they
opened a pop-up store

10:27.920 --> 10:29.960
in London's fashionable
Old Street.

10:30.000 --> 10:35.680
It was an instant success,
turning over almost £50,000
in its first month.

10:35.720 --> 10:38.360
We suddenly realized there was
going to be huge demand,

10:38.400 --> 10:43.240
and I called up Jen on a Friday
saying, "I think I'm gonna have
to quit my job."

10:43.280 --> 10:45.000
[Jen] We didn't know if people
would like it.

10:45.040 --> 10:46.920
It turned out they loved it.

10:46.960 --> 10:52.480
[narrator] Now, they're after
an investment of £250,000.

10:52.520 --> 10:57.280
Doing this, there's something
completely and utterly new
every single day.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.880
So happy.

10:59.920 --> 11:03.040
Oh, it's all coming together!

11:03.080 --> 11:07.960
[narrator] In just 24 hours,
the investors will be
arriving for lunch.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.440
So tonight,
both restaurants will open
to the Manchester public

11:11.480 --> 11:14.120
for their one and only
practice run.

11:14.160 --> 11:18.080
Naked Dough and Black Bear
Burger are getting ready
for their soft launch.

11:18.120 --> 11:21.960
From my own experience,
I know how stressful
and difficult this can be.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.600
Regardless of that,
they must deliver.

11:24.640 --> 11:28.240
It's their one and only
chance to get it right
before the investors arrive.

11:33.680 --> 11:35.600
-How are you?
-[Liz] Hello.

11:35.640 --> 11:37.480
-I like the shirt.
-Oh, thank you very much.

11:37.520 --> 11:39.120
-[Stew] Canadian.
-Canadian.

11:39.160 --> 11:41.320
-[Liz] Lumberjack.
-Oh, very good.

11:41.360 --> 11:44.440
So tell me about
Black Bear, then.
You're doing well, aren't you?

11:44.480 --> 11:46.120
Yeah, yeah,
it's going really well.

11:46.160 --> 11:48.440
The last year has been
a bit of whirlwind,
hasn't it?

11:48.480 --> 11:50.440
It's kind of gone a lot
better than we thought.

11:50.480 --> 11:53.000
You know, there is a big
elephant in the room here.

11:53.040 --> 11:56.160
I mean,
how do you think
you're going to

11:56.200 --> 11:58.800
take over some of
the very big brands
that are out there?

11:58.840 --> 12:01.240
We think that we've upped
the burger game.

12:01.280 --> 12:04.080
I think our burger is better
than what is out there
at the moment.

12:04.120 --> 12:06.440
Some of the bigger brands,
as they've grown,

12:06.480 --> 12:09.120
they've actually
lost a little bit
of sight of their quality.

12:09.160 --> 12:10.840
Kind of average.

12:10.880 --> 12:14.120
What you're saying is
very well-established,
well-known brands...

12:14.160 --> 12:16.040
You just said they're average?

12:16.080 --> 12:17.280
Big statement.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.640
-Big statement.
-[Liz] Yeah. Yeah.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.600
-Gotta back it up now.
-You need to try our burger.

12:20.640 --> 12:21.920
[laughs]

12:21.960 --> 12:23.640
-Okay, well good luck, guys.
-Thank you very much.

12:23.680 --> 12:26.400
-[Fred] We'll done.
-Thank you.

12:26.440 --> 12:32.520
The burger market is worth an
incredible 3.3 billion pounds
per year in the UK.

12:32.560 --> 12:35.680
Liz and Stew think
there is room
for one more brand.

12:35.720 --> 12:37.920
But to succeed, you need
a superb product,

12:37.960 --> 12:41.160
you need great branding
and amazing operation.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.480
But have they got
these crucial ingredients?

12:45.760 --> 12:49.240
[narrator]
Conditions are tough
for UK restaurants right now,

12:49.280 --> 12:52.040
especially the premium
burger market.

12:52.080 --> 12:56.360
But Liz and Stew believe
Black Bear's menu stands
out from the crowd.

12:57.920 --> 13:00.920
So, fairly simple menu,
but it's kind of
simple done well.

13:03.640 --> 13:08.320
[narrator] Their best-selling
Black Bear Burger is topped
with homemade onion jam,

13:08.360 --> 13:10.760
garlic mayonnaise
and bacon.

13:10.800 --> 13:14.040
It's priced at £7.50.

13:14.080 --> 13:18.520
For a pound more, the brisket
burger comes with cheese
and beef brisket

13:18.560 --> 13:21.120
braised in a beer
and mustard sauce.

13:23.800 --> 13:28.120
On the side,
buttermilk chicken nuggets
priced at five pounds

13:28.160 --> 13:31.320
and triple cooked chips
at £3.50.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.400
Wee!

13:33.440 --> 13:35.880
I'll do the fishy sauce first
and then I'll do the
onion puree.

13:35.920 --> 13:38.880
-If you do the chives,
then, after service...
-Yeah, okay.

13:38.920 --> 13:41.440
[narrator] As well as bringing
their own teams...

13:41.480 --> 13:43.960
-Hey, guys.
-[Jen] Hi!

13:44.000 --> 13:48.040
[narrator] Both restaurants
are provided with
experienced local staff.

13:48.080 --> 13:50.480
Familiarize yourself with
the flavors.

13:50.520 --> 13:53.680
Encouraging people to have
the milk with it,
because it's very rich.

13:53.720 --> 13:55.960
These guys still need stickers.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.760
[narrator] In Naked Dough,

13:57.800 --> 14:01.240
Jen and Hannah are after
a share of the UK's
five-billion pound

14:01.280 --> 14:02.840
confectionery market.

14:04.360 --> 14:07.880
"Cookie Monster,
Emoji Poo,
Nuttin' Better?"

14:07.920 --> 14:10.240
[exclaims] That's funny.
They've got
a sense of humor.

14:11.160 --> 14:12.640
-Hello. How are you?
-Hello.

14:12.680 --> 14:14.600
-I'm Fred.
-Welcome to Naked Dough.

14:14.640 --> 14:16.400
-Well, this exciting.
-Yeah.

14:16.440 --> 14:17.920
What is Naked Dough?

14:17.960 --> 14:19.960
-Did you ever make cookies,
when you were a kid?
-Yes.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.720
[Jen] Yes. This is
the stuff that you had
before it went in the oven.

14:23.760 --> 14:24.880
[Fred] And it's raw?

14:24.920 --> 14:26.440
[Hannah] It is raw.
[Jen] Completely raw.

14:26.480 --> 14:27.920
It looks like ice cream.

14:27.960 --> 14:30.440
It's safe to eat.
It's just like
a normal cookie dough,

14:30.480 --> 14:32.360
but it doesn't have
any raw eggs in it.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.320
It looks really naughty.

14:34.360 --> 14:36.600
It is very naughty.
It's an indulgent treat.

14:36.640 --> 14:40.080
You are already successful.
You're doing well.

14:40.120 --> 14:41.600
-Yeah.
-Yeah

14:41.640 --> 14:44.560
But, erm, what is
your ambition? I mean,
why are you here?

14:44.600 --> 14:49.440
The dream is to not only
have locations in London.

14:49.480 --> 14:53.400
We want to bring cookie dough
to the UK market as a whole,

14:53.440 --> 14:56.600
um, open in major cities
and potentially in cinemas

14:56.640 --> 14:57.920
-as an alternative sweet-treat.
-Yeah.

14:57.960 --> 15:01.640
Cookie dough domination
across the world.

15:01.680 --> 15:03.400
-Well, good luck, girls.
-[Hannah] Thank you very much.

15:03.440 --> 15:06.480
And don't forget, the investors
want to make as much dough
as you do.

15:06.520 --> 15:07.680
-[chuckles]
-Right?

15:07.720 --> 15:08.840
-I like that.
-Good luck.

15:08.880 --> 15:12.200
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you, bye.

15:12.240 --> 15:16.120
[narrator] Jen and Hannah's
product is designed to appeal
young consumers,

15:16.160 --> 15:19.560
the all-important
16 to 24-year-olds.

15:19.600 --> 15:22.080
There's a choice
of eight flavors.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.920
Alongside best-seller,
chocolate-chip,

15:24.960 --> 15:28.720
there's peanut butter,
salted caramel with honeycomb,

15:28.760 --> 15:31.400
and marshmallows
with sprinkles.

15:31.440 --> 15:34.480
A tub with two scoops
is £3.90.

15:34.520 --> 15:36.720
-It's not straight.
-It's not straight.

15:36.760 --> 15:40.720
[narrator]
To drink, a small bottle
of milk will cost £1.99.

15:49.120 --> 15:50.920
[narrator] 5:00 p.m.

15:50.960 --> 15:54.760
In an hour, Naked Dough
and Black Bear Burger
open its restaurants

15:54.800 --> 15:56.320
to the Manchester public.

15:57.680 --> 16:00.520
Like that, and have burger,
side, side.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.520
The first night of a restaurant
can be very difficult.

16:03.560 --> 16:07.040
People are out for a good
time and good food.

16:07.080 --> 16:09.600
It's not fine dining.
This is fun.

16:09.640 --> 16:11.440
So just go smash it.

16:11.480 --> 16:14.600
The troops must be primed
and ready for anything.

16:14.640 --> 16:18.360
Tonight, the customers
will expect great food
and great service,

16:18.400 --> 16:20.160
and nothing else will do.

16:20.200 --> 16:21.240
Time to open.

16:21.280 --> 16:22.520
Time to make some dough.

16:23.360 --> 16:24.480
[metal clanking]

16:24.520 --> 16:25.880
-[laughs]
-Sorry.

16:27.840 --> 16:30.360
Honestly, it's the first time
I've done a service
in a restaurant.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.120
Could be potentially
quite embarrassing,

16:32.160 --> 16:33.920
but I'm just going to give
it my best shot.

16:35.640 --> 16:38.240
-Okay, so you have
a table for two?
-I''ll come over

16:38.280 --> 16:40.360
to take your drinks order
in a minute.

16:40.400 --> 16:45.200
[narrator] For tonight's soft
launch, both restaurants are
offering 50 percent off.

16:45.240 --> 16:49.960
And just 45 minutes in,
Black Bear Burger
is fully booked.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.440
Yeah, and that is fries.

16:57.480 --> 17:02.280
[narrator] At Naked Dough,
they're relying on walk-ins.

17:06.120 --> 17:08.360
[Hannah]
Well, it's quite quiet,
to be honest.

17:08.400 --> 17:12.040
but we're hoping that it will
pick up.

17:12.080 --> 17:16.520
When we opened Old Street,
we had a queue literally
down the street.

17:16.560 --> 17:18.960
[Fred] How are you?
[Hannah] Hi! Yeah,
good, thank you.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.400
-It looks a bit quiet.
-Yeah, it has been
a bit quiet.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.360
It should be packed,
because it's half priced,
shouldn't it?

17:24.400 --> 17:26.160
Yeah, but I don't know
what to say.

17:26.200 --> 17:29.600
Have you been outside
leafleting, speaking to
people, getting them in?

17:30.320 --> 17:31.600
Manchester masses.

17:31.640 --> 17:33.040
Manchester masses,
let's do it.

17:33.080 --> 17:34.600
-See you later.
-[Jen] Thank you.

17:38.240 --> 17:39.880
Let's go.

17:39.920 --> 17:41.880
[Hannah] We're gonna try
some sampling,
we've got some fliers.

17:41.920 --> 17:45.120
It's a rush hour time,
people leaving from work,
so it's like the perfect time

17:45.160 --> 17:48.080
to go outside
and try and get people
to come in.

17:48.120 --> 17:49.760
[Jen] Let's do it.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.480
Push, push, push, push.

17:51.520 --> 17:54.440
Hi, would you like to try
some cookie dough?

17:54.480 --> 17:55.760
-Raw cookie dough?
-You like it?

17:55.800 --> 17:57.640
-Yeah, it's nice.
-Did you like it?

17:57.680 --> 18:00.440
-[woman] It's delicious.
-And we have a pop-up literally
just down there.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.240
Hi, guys, do you want to try
some cookie dough?

18:02.280 --> 18:05.640
We actually have a pop-up
right there and it's
50 percent off.

18:05.680 --> 18:07.520
Hi, guys,
would you like to try
some cookie dough?

18:07.560 --> 18:09.000
People who try it,
love it.

18:09.040 --> 18:11.680
Today, we've got, um,
a pop-up.

18:11.720 --> 18:13.960
It's just a case of educating
people, really.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.280
Go and check it out,
it's a really fun place.

18:16.320 --> 18:17.720
[Hannah] Should we get going?
[Jen] Yeah.

18:20.880 --> 18:24.520
-Brisket, no--
-Brisket, no mayo,
two briskets, Black Bear...

18:24.560 --> 18:27.280
[Fred] Black Bear Burger
have only operated their
store before.

18:27.320 --> 18:30.080
Running a restaurant
is a completely
different ball-game.

18:30.120 --> 18:31.720
Get crackin'
on the next ones then.

18:31.760 --> 18:33.440
Tonight's service
is a crucial test

18:33.480 --> 18:36.440
as to whether they can
operate on
a much bigger scale.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.320
Still getting used
to the table numbers.

18:38.360 --> 18:41.400
[narrator] Up till now,
Liz and Stew
have only ever served

18:41.440 --> 18:42.760
one customer at a time.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.640
Here you go, mate.

18:44.680 --> 18:46.720
We were missing the five
black burgers, we didn't get
the five black burgers.

18:46.760 --> 18:47.840
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.600
Oh, God,
I'm really sorry
about that.

18:49.640 --> 18:52.640
Babe, you didn't get
five Black Bears
on the takeaway order.

18:52.680 --> 18:54.160
Could you get those
on for me now?

18:54.200 --> 18:56.520
-We just can't get stuff out
quick enough.
-[Liz] Yeah.

18:58.160 --> 18:59.480
How's it going?

18:59.520 --> 19:01.720
Yeah, it's all right
so far. Um...

19:01.760 --> 19:04.520
Yeah. A few little,
kind of, pickups.
A little bit slow

19:04.560 --> 19:06.920
-off the bat, but I think we
can catch up.
-What do you mean slow?

19:06.960 --> 19:09.680
-For the cooking?
-For the service, yeah.
Well, just...

19:09.720 --> 19:11.320
Kind of...
As they all came in at once,

19:11.360 --> 19:12.920
we've done them
one at a go,

19:12.960 --> 19:15.400
but now we're kinda
just speeding up orders
a little bit.

19:15.440 --> 19:17.840
-I'll get your burger on in
a second...
-Yeah, I'll have a double.

19:17.880 --> 19:20.520
-[Stew] Double?
-Yeah. I might as well, no?

19:25.080 --> 19:28.400
So, you've got a brisket
and a Black Bear with
nuggets and fries. Okay?

19:28.440 --> 19:31.680
This is very good,
and what's even better is
the fries are amazing.

19:31.720 --> 19:37.920
My burger was absolutely great.
It was, like,
melt in the mouth.

19:37.960 --> 19:40.840
The food's amazing.
That's definitely one of
the best burgers I've had.

19:40.880 --> 19:44.680
There's no doubt in my mind
that Black Bear does
amazing burgers.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.840
The thing is, the offering
is very simple.

19:46.880 --> 19:50.840
Now, it's enough for a street
stall, but is it enough
for a restaurant?

19:58.880 --> 20:00.240
[narrator] At Naked Dough...

20:00.720 --> 20:02.240
Of course, yeah.

20:02.280 --> 20:04.240
Thanks so much,
and used very well. Great.

20:04.280 --> 20:06.760
[narrator]
Word spread about their
half-price offer.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.440
[Fred]
So, you got busy just now?

20:08.480 --> 20:10.240
-Yeah, it's brilliant.
-Yeah, it did.

20:10.280 --> 20:12.480
So is the till ringing?

20:12.520 --> 20:14.400
The till is ringing away.

20:14.440 --> 20:18.280
It's good.
This more what we're
used to, so it's great.

20:18.320 --> 20:19.680
[Fred]
How's everything?
Do you like it?

20:19.720 --> 20:20.880
It's sweet,
but yeah, very nice.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.160
[Fred]
Is it too sweet?

20:22.200 --> 20:24.320
-No, no, it's not.
-No such thing as too sweet.

20:24.360 --> 20:26.840
I had the salted caramel one,
and it was perfect.

20:26.880 --> 20:28.440
How often would you come back?

20:28.480 --> 20:32.240
-Every day.
-[Fred] Every day? Wow,
you've got a sweet tooth.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.640
Both restaurants
found last night difficult,

20:50.680 --> 20:53.160
but today is going to be
even more difficult.

20:53.200 --> 20:55.040
The investors
are coming in for lunch.

20:56.520 --> 20:58.960
Their first bite
of their food is everything.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.440
Get it right,
and they could well
fall in love with the business.

21:01.480 --> 21:04.160
Get it wrong,
and they might
just walk away.

21:05.480 --> 21:06.920
[narrator]
At Black Bear Burger,

21:06.960 --> 21:09.160
Liz and Stew
have given up their jobs

21:09.200 --> 21:14.720
as a burns nurse
and an oil trader to pursue
their restaurant dream.

21:14.760 --> 21:17.600
-Our families weren't that
impressed at first, were they?
-No.

21:17.640 --> 21:22.320
Especially, I think, 'cause
he'd done really well
at university, got first class,

21:22.360 --> 21:24.920
so they, kind of, had really
high hopes for him.

21:24.960 --> 21:28.520
Then when he was suddenly
like, "Actually, I'm going to
quit my job and flip burgers,"

21:28.560 --> 21:31.280
uh, they were a little bit
concerned.

21:31.320 --> 21:32.520
It is scary.

21:33.880 --> 21:36.280
But we're going to give it
our best shot,

21:36.320 --> 21:38.440
and hopefully
get an investment
at the end of it.

21:41.640 --> 21:43.400
-Morning.
-[Liz] Morning.

21:43.440 --> 21:45.320
-So, big day today.
-Yeah.

21:45.360 --> 21:49.160
Two big investors
are coming in.
Tim Gee from Allied London

21:49.200 --> 21:50.280
and Scott Collins.

21:51.280 --> 21:53.120
Well,
he's Mr. Burger himself.

21:53.160 --> 21:55.800
He's the man
behind MEATliquor.

21:55.840 --> 21:57.440
-Have you heard about
MEATliquor?
-Yeah.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.480
How do you feel about him
coming in and telling you

21:59.520 --> 22:01.160
what he thinks
about your burger?

22:01.200 --> 22:03.280
We are nervous, aren't we?

22:03.320 --> 22:05.120
-There's nowhere to hide.
-There's nowhere to hide.

22:05.160 --> 22:06.680
He knows a burger.

22:06.720 --> 22:09.440
You think your burger is
better than the one
of MEATliquor?

22:09.480 --> 22:11.240
-What you gotta say now?
-[both laughing]

22:13.280 --> 22:15.520
-It's very different.
-You always think your
burger is the best.

22:15.560 --> 22:17.400
Yeah, well, listen,
good luck today.

22:17.440 --> 22:19.040
-Enjoy it, if you can.
-We'll try.

22:19.080 --> 22:21.520
-[Fred] See you later.
-Thanks, Fred.
See you. Bye.

22:25.040 --> 22:26.840
[narrator]
Over the next two days,

22:26.880 --> 22:30.440
the investors will test
the restaurants'
business plans and service.

22:30.480 --> 22:34.360
But today's private lunch,
is all about the food.

22:34.400 --> 22:37.160
-We can do this, two burgers.
-I know.

22:39.280 --> 22:43.640
[narrator] First to arrive,
Scott Collins of burger group
MEATliquor.

22:43.680 --> 22:46.800
He's looking for a potential
diffusion brand.

22:46.840 --> 22:49.640
I'm constantly evolving
as a business person,

22:49.680 --> 22:54.280
I've seen a recent trend
in much larger meat brands

22:54.320 --> 22:58.720
who are invested in smaller
start-up, independent

22:58.760 --> 23:00.400
versions in the same
marketplace.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.840
And Black Bear Burger,

23:02.880 --> 23:05.400
they're starting up,
they're small,
they're in the same industry...

23:05.440 --> 23:08.000
It's perfectly feasible
that I could run

23:08.040 --> 23:09.840
a second burger company
alongside MEATliquor.

23:09.880 --> 23:12.440
[narrator] His competition
is Tim Gee.

23:12.480 --> 23:15.000
He works for a major
property developer

23:15.040 --> 23:17.080
and is after new food brands.

23:18.240 --> 23:20.800
[Tim] From an investor's
perspective,

23:20.840 --> 23:25.760
you do start to question
whether the market's
over-saturated for burgers.

23:25.800 --> 23:28.320
But there's always room for
a standout product.

23:28.360 --> 23:30.880
I mean, there's a heck of
a lot of pizza and pasta
in Italy,

23:30.920 --> 23:33.600
but you still open successful
pizza and pasta restaurants.

23:38.040 --> 23:40.000
-[Liz] Hello.
-Hi. Tim

23:40.040 --> 23:41.400
Hi, nice to meet you,
I'm Liz.

23:41.440 --> 23:43.360
-Scott.
-Nice to meet you.
How 's it going?

23:43.400 --> 23:45.200
Welcome to Black Bear Burger.

23:45.240 --> 23:47.840
-Thank you very much.
-Come in. I'll take you
to your seats.

23:52.160 --> 23:54.440
So, we've got some menus
for you.

23:54.480 --> 23:55.960
-Thanks.
-Very simple.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.520
[narrator]
The lunch offer today...

23:57.560 --> 24:01.320
Just two drinks,
two burgers,
and two sides.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.720
Good, succinct menu.

24:04.880 --> 24:06.160
Yeah.

24:06.200 --> 24:09.560
I'm going to have a proper
pig out and go for

24:09.600 --> 24:14.480
-the Double-Out Black Bear,
nuggets, and fries, please.
-Nice. Good choice.

24:14.520 --> 24:17.880
What would you go for?
I mean there's only a choice
of two...

24:17.920 --> 24:21.080
-Well,
try the Classic Black Bear.
-All right.

24:21.120 --> 24:23.480
-See how you get on
with the Black Bear first.
-Sounds like a plan.

24:23.520 --> 24:24.880
[Liz] All right, cool.
Thank you, guys.

24:27.960 --> 24:32.880
To present a burger well,
it's not necessarily
very easy at all.

24:32.920 --> 24:37.360
And you can tell a lot from
about how it's going to
taste by looking at it.

24:38.160 --> 24:39.760
So I want it to look great.

24:40.840 --> 24:42.280
[whispers]
Look at that!

24:45.320 --> 24:47.880
[Jen]
So should we put the milk
on the table, then?

24:47.920 --> 24:49.920
[narrator]
Opposite Black Bear Burger,

24:49.960 --> 24:55.280
Hannah and Jen have staked
everything to build their
cookie-dough empire.

24:55.320 --> 24:57.240
Should we give them
a little menu each?

24:58.600 --> 25:00.360
All our savings are gone now.

25:00.400 --> 25:05.600
We've put friendships on hold,
we've put relationships
on hold.

25:05.640 --> 25:07.400
Hannah's quit her job.

25:07.440 --> 25:10.360
-Naked Dough is...
It's fair to say it's our life.
-Yeah, it's our life.

25:13.920 --> 25:16.920
[narrator]
Jamie Barber, of top
London restaurant, Hache,

25:16.960 --> 25:20.600
and two successful restaurant
chains, is first to arrive.

25:21.920 --> 25:25.360
[Jamie]
There is nobody
that's really taking on

25:25.400 --> 25:30.640
that instantaneous,
concession-based
sweet treats in cinemas

25:30.680 --> 25:33.200
and retail environments
and shopping centers,

25:33.240 --> 25:35.080
so this could be it.

25:35.120 --> 25:38.880
If the model stacks up,
if the product is fantastic,

25:38.920 --> 25:42.960
300 Naked Doughs,
each turning over
at £700,000 a year,

25:43.000 --> 25:45.120
that's £1,900 million worth
of turnover.

25:45.160 --> 25:47.120
That is a massive business.

25:49.640 --> 25:53.120
[narrator]
Next, Shruti Ajitsaria,
a private investor

25:53.160 --> 25:56.800
with a track record
in backing
successful restaurants.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.560
It's really interesting that
I have never come across

26:00.600 --> 26:02.680
a cookie-dough
provider before.

26:02.720 --> 26:06.320
I think it's a new idea,
unique idea, but what I do
like about it is that it's not

26:06.360 --> 26:08.440
a seasonal product,
so it's not like ice-cream,

26:08.480 --> 26:09.880
where you only need it
to be sunny.

26:09.920 --> 26:12.160
I think there will always
be a space in the market

26:12.200 --> 26:14.560
for things
that are naughty treats,
and that's what this is.

26:17.040 --> 26:19.120
[narrator] Finally,
Chris Miller,

26:19.160 --> 26:23.080
founder
of the multi-million pound
White Rabbit Investment Fund.

26:24.640 --> 26:28.480
The economics for each site
could be very exciting.

26:28.520 --> 26:32.800
You don't need a very
expensive fit-out, you don't
need an expensive kitchen

26:32.840 --> 26:34.760
which means you don't have
huge rents to pay...

26:34.800 --> 26:37.840
Because of all of that,
it's something you can grow
quite quickly.

26:41.040 --> 26:42.280
-Hello.
-Hi.

26:42.320 --> 26:44.280
-Hello.
-It's so nice to meet you,
Shruti.

26:44.320 --> 26:45.800
-Nice to meet you.
-Welcome to Naked Dough.

26:45.840 --> 26:47.760
-Welcome to Naked Dough.
-Have a look
at the Cookie Dough.

26:47.800 --> 26:50.040
[Jamie] Are you excited?
[Hannah] Yeah, very excited.

26:50.080 --> 26:53.400
Would you like to have
a sort of...
A little mini-menu each?

26:53.440 --> 26:55.920
-Perfect.
-Thank you.

26:55.960 --> 26:57.800
What's your best-selling
flavor?

26:57.840 --> 26:59.800
So, I would say Emoji Poos,

26:59.840 --> 27:02.720
that, obviously,
nobody likes to say
the name of out loud,

27:02.760 --> 27:05.240
um, and the Hazel's Nuts.

27:05.280 --> 27:07.320
[Chris] Do they need
to be kept cold?

27:07.360 --> 27:11.400
[Jen] So, it can last
up to four hours completely,
safely out of the fridge,

27:11.440 --> 27:13.280
but then you can then take
it home, refrigerate it,

27:13.320 --> 27:16.320
you can even put it
in the freezer, as well.

27:16.360 --> 27:18.200
What would you guys
like to try?

27:18.240 --> 27:21.080
-I'd like to try the salted
caramel one.
-[Jen] Yeah, definitely.

27:21.120 --> 27:24.160
-May I try
the cookies 'n cream?
-Hazelnut, please.

27:24.200 --> 27:25.680
Can you bake it as well?

27:25.720 --> 27:29.320
When we took out the egg,
we took out the raising
agent.

27:29.360 --> 27:32.360
-So it's warm-able,
just not bake-able.
-Right.

27:32.400 --> 27:35.040
And can I have
the peanut butter
and the toffee apple?

27:40.800 --> 27:45.160
You get a very, very
sugary hit as soon as you
eat the first mouthful.

27:45.200 --> 27:48.240
-Well, I mean, it's very
tasty, but it's like... Whoa!
-[Jen] Yeah.

27:48.280 --> 27:49.960
[Shruti] Right.
Question on health...

27:50.000 --> 27:51.440
-How healthy do you feel?
-Yeah.

27:51.480 --> 27:54.160
[laughs] Exactly.
How ginormous is
this going to make me?

27:54.200 --> 27:57.680
-You know.
What is the calorie...
-Calorie content?

27:57.720 --> 28:00.320
I don't know
the exact calorie content.

28:00.360 --> 28:04.560
I think people see it as
an indulgent treat.

28:04.600 --> 28:07.760
It's about having a sneaky,
sweet treat.

28:16.400 --> 28:17.520
Wow!

28:21.040 --> 28:22.280
That's delicious.

28:22.880 --> 28:24.120
Good beef.

28:25.520 --> 28:28.200
[Tim]
You're eating a beef burger.
It's beef.

28:28.240 --> 28:33.280
I want it to have flavor.
And, yeah, that's getting
down to that...

28:33.320 --> 28:36.640
Eating, and how many napkins
I'm going to end up
piling up.

28:36.680 --> 28:39.440
That's the sign
of a good burger,
is when you've got

28:39.480 --> 28:43.800
piles of used napkins,
cause you've had to keep,

28:43.840 --> 28:46.400
yeah, wiping your hands.

28:46.440 --> 28:49.200
I see nodding heads,
so, hopefully,
that's a good thing.

28:50.880 --> 28:52.080
That's very, very good.

28:53.160 --> 28:55.760
I come across a lot
of shit burgers.

28:55.800 --> 28:58.520
That's a really,
really good burger.

28:58.560 --> 28:59.840
You're all in, aren't you?

28:59.880 --> 29:01.400
[Scott]
It's very easy to judge
a burger.

29:01.440 --> 29:04.160
You get a piece of every
ingredient in the first
mouthful.

29:04.200 --> 29:06.640
It's got to be balanced,
it's got to be special.

29:06.680 --> 29:08.080
It can't be average.

29:08.120 --> 29:09.720
Do you wanna grab a beer
and join us for a chat?

29:09.760 --> 29:10.760
[Liz] Yeah,
that would be great.

29:12.320 --> 29:13.880
-That's a bit more relaxed,
isn't it?
-Yeah.

29:13.920 --> 29:16.080
[all laughing]

29:16.120 --> 29:18.040
So how many covers
did you do last night?

29:18.080 --> 29:19.760
-About 61.
-About 60.

29:19.800 --> 29:22.360
Yeah, which, honestly,
we're used to doing.

29:22.400 --> 29:25.160
that in Boxpark.
More.

29:25.200 --> 29:27.360
But's a very, very different
way of serving people.

29:27.400 --> 29:29.240
Did you give knives and
forks at Boxpark?

29:29.280 --> 29:31.720
-No.
-Then don't do it
here tomorrow.

29:31.760 --> 29:33.160
We haven't used them.

29:33.200 --> 29:35.400
-Oh, yeah.
-It'd be less work for you.

29:35.440 --> 29:38.720
That's probably the only
nugget of good advice
I've got.

29:38.760 --> 29:40.840
-May have peaked too early.
-[Liz] That's not bad.
[laughs]

29:42.200 --> 29:43.760
[Tim] It was,
it was delicious.

29:43.800 --> 29:46.360
Um, the burger lived up
to expectations.

29:46.400 --> 29:48.560
It was a really, really,
really great burger.

29:48.600 --> 29:49.960
-Thank you very much.
-[Liz] No worries.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.080
You can relax now.

29:52.120 --> 29:54.640
[Tim] Probably a bit of
a concern in terms of the
limited menu and the focus.

29:54.680 --> 29:59.360
If you lived here, over the
course of a year, how many
of those burgers could you eat?

30:02.120 --> 30:03.880
[both laughing]

30:06.080 --> 30:08.840
I wanna see
how easy it is to do.
Will you be the timer?

30:08.880 --> 30:10.240
Sure.

30:10.280 --> 30:12.000
[narrator]
Time to put
Naked Dough to the test.

30:12.040 --> 30:14.760
Like any successful
fast food business,

30:14.800 --> 30:16.760
speed of service is key.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.320
-Hello.
-Welcome to Naked Dough.

30:19.360 --> 30:22.120
Hi, so my friend
told me about this.

30:22.160 --> 30:24.680
I don't really
understand the concept.
What is it?

30:24.720 --> 30:27.160
-We have raw cookie dough...
-Okay.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.360
In several different,
delicious flavors.

30:29.400 --> 30:31.880
-Two flavors in a tub.
-I would like a scoop of that,
please.

30:31.920 --> 30:33.480
-Yes.
-And which is the other one
that you recommend?

30:33.520 --> 30:34.640
Um, this one.

30:34.680 --> 30:36.200
-I'll have a sprinkle.
-Okay.

30:36.240 --> 30:38.440
-Like that? Like that?
-Yeah, perfect. Perfect.

30:38.480 --> 30:39.880
-Thank you so much.
-Perfect.

30:39.920 --> 30:42.200
-How long was that, roughly?
-Two minutes ten.

30:42.240 --> 30:45.160
Two minutes a serve...

30:45.200 --> 30:49.760
Means that one person can do
thirty portions an hour.

30:49.800 --> 30:53.520
So if your average transaction
value is, let's call it,

30:53.560 --> 30:55.880
three pounds,
for the sake of argument,

30:55.920 --> 30:59.440
then that means the maximum
one person can do

30:59.480 --> 31:03.320
is going to be £90 an hour.

31:03.360 --> 31:07.240
So, that just gives you an
idea in terms of what the
maximum turnover

31:07.280 --> 31:09.160
that you could do
per server, per hour.

31:09.200 --> 31:13.320
Talking people
through the process,
does slow down sales.

31:13.360 --> 31:16.760
That said, the first time you
talked me through it,
it takes some time,

31:16.800 --> 31:19.680
but then after that,
they actually know
what they're coming in for

31:19.720 --> 31:21.800
and it starts to be
a lot quicker.

31:21.840 --> 31:25.200
But what would be really
good is if you had
pre-made tubs with

31:25.240 --> 31:29.360
the little watermelon
scoopy-sized,
the watermelon baller-sizes,

31:29.400 --> 31:32.480
so if somebody wanted to come
in just to get a selection
of flavors,

31:32.520 --> 31:34.520
that's a very quick thing
for them to get.

31:36.880 --> 31:40.400
I think that this is
a problem.

31:41.640 --> 31:43.520
Okay.

31:43.560 --> 31:48.800
The fact that we've hardly made
a dent into any of them,
is that not a worry?

31:48.840 --> 31:50.760
It's something
that we fully acknowledge.

31:50.800 --> 31:53.920
I take it that it's not that
you didn't enjoy the flavor,
it's just too much.

31:53.960 --> 31:57.360
Yeah, it's like the first
couple of spoonfuls
are blissful...

31:57.400 --> 32:00.760
-Yeah.
-And then, it becomes
quite hard going.

32:02.960 --> 32:04.640
I thought it was a really,
really lovely experience

32:04.680 --> 32:06.600
I thought the branding
was great.
I thought they were brilliant.

32:06.640 --> 32:09.240
I thought the first taste
was absolutely delicious.
Really tasty.

32:09.280 --> 32:12.040
It had exactly the consistency
of cookie-dough,
which I love.

32:12.080 --> 32:15.760
It was actually more the second
bite that started to make me
feel like my mouth was

32:15.800 --> 32:19.320
was sticking together,
and it was very, very sweet.

32:19.360 --> 32:23.560
And I'm not sure whether
people would return
for that product.

32:23.600 --> 32:25.320
-Thank you so much, guys. Bye.
-Bye. Thank you.

32:25.360 --> 32:28.480
-See you later.
-Product, I think,
is half there.

32:28.520 --> 32:30.440
[Jen] Bye.
[Hannah] Bye.

32:30.480 --> 32:33.080
[Jamie]
And I want to understand
whether customers

32:33.120 --> 32:35.080
who fit the target demographic

32:35.120 --> 32:37.480
really respond to it
in a positive way.

32:37.520 --> 32:39.160
I think that's really
going to dictate, to me,

32:39.200 --> 32:40.560
whether or not
it's a viable investment.

32:40.600 --> 32:43.400
-How lovely are they?
-Really nice.

32:43.440 --> 32:47.120
At the moment, it feels like
it could be a little bit
of a, liitle bit of a fad

32:47.160 --> 32:51.760
and novelty that I...
I would absolutely buy
to try it out,

32:51.800 --> 32:54.720
'cause it looks great and
tastes great

32:54.760 --> 32:58.360
for the first bit,
but would I buy it again?
Probably not.

32:58.400 --> 33:02.560
In reality now,
it's given me more questions
than answers

33:02.600 --> 33:04.840
before this turns into
an investable opportunity.

33:08.480 --> 33:12.880
[narrator] Tomorrow lunchtime,
the investors will return to
see how the restaurants cope

33:12.920 --> 33:15.520
when they're full
of paying customers.

33:15.560 --> 33:18.040
But today isn't over.

33:18.080 --> 33:23.160
Jen and Hannah and
Stew and Liz now face a
grueling business meeting.

33:23.200 --> 33:26.640
And one investor has already
made up their mind.

33:26.680 --> 33:28.440
[Fred] So, Scott, what do you
think of Black Bear Burger?

33:28.480 --> 33:31.400
Their passion, their
enthusiasm, it was all there.
It was great.

33:31.440 --> 33:34.040
They do what we do.

33:34.080 --> 33:37.840
We sort our products really
well. We put a lot of
attention to detail.

33:37.880 --> 33:41.680
But I was hoping there'd be
some little point of
difference that would...

33:41.720 --> 33:44.400
Would make it a bit
more exciting.

33:44.440 --> 33:47.240
Some little Midas touch.

33:47.280 --> 33:50.400
But do you think that two
burger brands, like yours
and theirs,

33:50.440 --> 33:52.240
could co-exist side by side?

33:52.280 --> 33:57.640
Yeah, the burger market's big.
Um, we don't do
just burgers.

33:57.680 --> 34:00.480
I think they're looking to
expand their menu a little
bit further down the line,

34:00.520 --> 34:05.480
but right now, they just
didn't have that... sort of
missing X-factor.

34:05.520 --> 34:07.840
So are you still having your
business meeting with
them later on?

34:07.880 --> 34:12.520
Having been through this
process myself,
in the past, with businesses,

34:12.560 --> 34:16.400
the last thing I'd want is to
waste anybody's time
or give them false hope.

34:16.440 --> 34:18.040
No, I think fair play.

34:22.520 --> 34:24.520
-How are you?
-Yes, good. How are you?

34:24.560 --> 34:26.560
-Good, thank you very much.
-Good.

34:26.600 --> 34:28.680
I've got a bit of bad news
to announce to you.

34:28.720 --> 34:31.520
-Okay.
-Scott Collins has decided
to pull out.

34:32.640 --> 34:34.160
How come?
What's...

34:34.200 --> 34:38.040
-Um, he loved the burger.
He thought it was fantastic.
-Thanks.

34:38.080 --> 34:42.240
Just, for him, there wasn't
enough in it to justify
an investment.

34:43.840 --> 34:45.920
-Tim Gee is still in the
running...
-[Liz and Stew] Yeah.

34:45.960 --> 34:48.520
And he wants to talk to you
later on about your
business plan.

34:48.560 --> 34:51.080
-[Liz] Okay.
-So, um, you're still
in the race.

34:51.120 --> 34:52.520
We'll give it our best shot.

34:52.560 --> 34:55.400
-All our eggs are in one
basket now, so, yeah.
-Okay.

34:55.440 --> 34:58.200
-Good luck, guys. Good luck.
-Thank you very much.
See ya.

35:00.480 --> 35:01.720
What you think about that,
then?

35:01.760 --> 35:03.560
-I think it was--
-I was a bit surprised.

35:03.600 --> 35:06.320
-Yeah.
-Yeah, still got one more.

35:06.360 --> 35:08.520
-One more chance,
see how it goes.
-Yeah.

35:12.440 --> 35:16.680
[narrator] Both restaurants
will now have one hour
with each remaining investor

35:16.720 --> 35:19.560
to go through their finances
and plans for the future.

35:21.280 --> 35:24.280
Naked Dough are up first.

35:24.320 --> 35:27.160
And as all three investors
are in competition
with each other,

35:27.200 --> 35:29.640
they'll each have an hour
alone with Jen and Hannah.

35:31.920 --> 35:34.000
A really good
restaurant investment

35:34.040 --> 35:36.040
might have what's called
a return on investment,

35:36.080 --> 35:38.320
or return on capital
of somewhere between

35:38.360 --> 35:41.800
25 and 35,
or even 40 percent.

35:41.840 --> 35:44.840
Now, what that means is,
if I invest £100,000,

35:44.880 --> 35:47.920
I should get that money back
over three years.

35:47.960 --> 35:49.800
They're saying that they're
going to get their money back

35:49.840 --> 35:51.680
in three months,
not three years,

35:51.720 --> 35:55.480
so I think we really need
to probe and see whether
those numbers do stack up.

35:55.520 --> 35:56.920
Hi, again.

35:56.960 --> 36:00.320
[Shruti]
I love backing other female
entrepreneurs,

36:00.360 --> 36:02.680
so I'm really pleased
to see two women

36:02.720 --> 36:05.440
who have done such
a lot in a short period
of time.

36:05.480 --> 36:08.920
I think if I had the confidence
they we're going to make
that product right,

36:08.960 --> 36:11.320
I definitely like them enough
to go into business with them.

36:12.560 --> 36:14.240
-Hello.
-Hi, how you're doing?

36:14.280 --> 36:16.280
[Chris]
There's definitely a potential
for investment still.

36:16.320 --> 36:21.280
I need to see their financials
and properly understand
what's going on there.

36:21.320 --> 36:26.160
[narrator] Up 'til now,
Naked Dough has only traded
at London's Old Street.

36:26.200 --> 36:32.320
Jen and Hannah want £250,000
to take it nationwide.

36:34.720 --> 36:38.880
I really love cookie dough.
Like, I'm the person, that in
the Ben &amp; Jerry's ice-cream,

36:38.920 --> 36:43.160
eats the cookie dough.
But even I could not have
finished a pot of that.

36:43.200 --> 36:45.680
I mean that is my major
concern with it, really.

36:45.720 --> 36:47.440
You know,
every pot came with a lid.

36:47.480 --> 36:49.320
And you know, if
you decide to eat it
then and there,

36:49.360 --> 36:51.840
then great,
and if you decide to take
it home...

36:51.880 --> 36:55.000
I think very few people
are going to think,
"I'll eat a little bit here

36:55.040 --> 36:58.240
and I'll take it home."
I just, that doesn't
make sense to me.

36:59.560 --> 37:01.800
[Jamie] Now is where
the nitty-gritty starts.

37:01.840 --> 37:07.480
So you've had June, July,
August, September and
October at the Old Street.

37:07.520 --> 37:10.440
-Yeah.
-So run me through
the turnover in those months.

37:10.480 --> 37:15.920
So the first month was,
I think, nearly 48,000...
48,000.

37:15.960 --> 37:18.080
-So 48,000 in June.
-Mmm-hmm.

37:18.120 --> 37:22.320
-And then July?
-[Jen] Um, 40, nearly 43,000.

37:23.240 --> 37:26.440
-And in August?
-Was 36,000.

37:26.480 --> 37:27.440
[Jamie] Yep.

37:27.480 --> 37:30.200
-28,000 in September.
-Yeah, yeah.

37:30.240 --> 37:33.160
And then it went to 23
in October.

37:33.200 --> 37:36.920
That's not a building revenue
stream, that's a declining
revenue stream.

37:36.960 --> 37:42.880
The facts are, in six months,
the turnover is half from
where it was when it started.

37:42.920 --> 37:45.680
Now, that decline is very,
very scary,

37:45.720 --> 37:49.880
and if those are the only facts
you got to look at, you got
to take them very seriously.

37:49.920 --> 37:51.040
So I'm worried.

37:51.080 --> 37:54.680
He did grill us
on the numbers.

37:54.720 --> 37:58.120
It's a shame that
we don't have more than
five months worth of data,

37:58.160 --> 38:00.760
because I think we were always
gonna start with the traction
that we had.

38:00.800 --> 38:03.720
It was always going to start
off on a ridiculous high.

38:03.760 --> 38:07.640
We realize that Old Street
hasn't been the best location
to hit our target market,

38:07.680 --> 38:09.400
so we did see that drop.

38:09.440 --> 38:11.600
I think you're absolutely
right on the location.

38:11.640 --> 38:17.000
It's not right for you.
I totally understand why
you've had this big jump

38:17.040 --> 38:20.840
at the start, and then
quite a dramatic fall off.

38:20.880 --> 38:24.440
The question is
where does that end,

38:24.480 --> 38:26.760
and will that be repeated
for other sites?

38:26.800 --> 38:29.720
It's one that I'm genuinely
tempted to buy

38:29.760 --> 38:31.800
because it's such a lovely
business model.

38:31.840 --> 38:35.320
They'll open a good few sites.
The problem is,
with those places,

38:35.360 --> 38:38.200
is you'll open with a big bang
and soon as your sales drop
off,

38:38.240 --> 38:40.160
they kick you out very
quickly.

38:40.200 --> 38:45.440
How difficult is it for
somebody else to come
in with a cookie-dough brand?

38:45.480 --> 38:48.640
Not difficult.
It could be replicated.

38:48.680 --> 38:51.560
Which is why we
need to act quickly.

38:51.600 --> 38:54.120
[narrator] During the meeting,
the investors can choose to

38:54.160 --> 38:55.840
spell out the offer
they'll make

38:55.880 --> 38:59.640
if, and only if,
they decide
to invest tomorrow.

38:59.680 --> 39:05.520
Right now, I have no idea
what an offer will be,
because I need to go away

39:05.560 --> 39:07.520
and understand the numbers.

39:07.560 --> 39:10.440
Will it become like
Krispy Kreme donuts

39:10.480 --> 39:15.640
or Millie's Cookies?
Or will it be
just another fad?

39:15.680 --> 39:19.120
It's definitely one
that would be
a roll of the dice.

39:19.160 --> 39:22.000
Need to sleep on it
and look at some numbers
in the morning.

39:22.040 --> 39:23.200
-Thank you.
-[Chris] Thanks very much.

39:23.240 --> 39:25.440
Thank you so much.
Very nice to meet you.

39:25.480 --> 39:30.760
He seems so well-versed
in exactly how this
would work.

39:30.800 --> 39:33.920
He has...
I get the impression
that he...

39:35.280 --> 39:37.920
He would know exactly how
to scale this.

39:37.960 --> 39:39.880
So actually, I think, what
would be really interesting
for me

39:39.920 --> 39:41.760
to do tomorrow,
is to talk to the customers.

39:41.800 --> 39:43.960
That's the piece that's going
to be really interesting
for me tomorrow,

39:44.000 --> 39:46.560
is finding out
what other people think.
I understand how I think,

39:46.600 --> 39:48.520
but l just want to see
what others think.

39:48.560 --> 39:52.040
Obviously, I've got my own
perspective on whether or not
I would eat an entire

39:52.080 --> 39:56.000
two scoops of cookie dough,
but it would be interesting
to hear what other people say.

39:56.040 --> 39:57.600
I think, if they can't shape
their product

39:57.640 --> 39:59.440
in a way that will
make people go back

39:59.480 --> 40:02.640
to have it again and
again and again, then...

40:02.680 --> 40:04.280
Then it's not going to work
as business.

40:04.320 --> 40:06.120
-Thank you very much.
-Nice to see you.

40:06.160 --> 40:09.200
[Jen] She had really good
constructive criticism
for us.

40:09.240 --> 40:14.240
She felt very strongly
about the product offering
not being right.

40:14.280 --> 40:17.600
We need to discuss that,
whether we'd be willing to...

40:19.040 --> 40:20.880
To change it.

40:20.920 --> 40:23.840
I'm not necessarily the
target demographic,
which is why I'd like to see

40:23.880 --> 40:27.440
how the demographic
that you really are after
responds to it.

40:27.480 --> 40:29.560
I think that they've got
the genesis of a good idea.

40:29.600 --> 40:32.400
I think they've got a product
which they know,
is not perfect.

40:32.440 --> 40:35.760
I want to see
how the general public
respond to it.

40:35.800 --> 40:38.000
So tomorrow's the day.

40:38.040 --> 40:40.000
Thank you very much and
look forward to tomorrow.

40:40.040 --> 40:42.680
-Thank you very much.
Nice to see you.
-And you.

40:42.720 --> 40:46.240
I have faith in the people
that are coming tomorrow.

40:46.280 --> 40:50.520
I think, fingers crossed,
they do us proud
and they like the product

40:50.560 --> 40:53.200
and they give good feedback
to the investors.

40:53.240 --> 40:54.520
It's not really in our hands.

40:55.040 --> 40:56.200
It's in theirs.

40:58.560 --> 41:01.040
[narrator] Now,
it's Black Bear Burger's turn.

41:02.360 --> 41:04.600
With Scott Collins
no longer in the running,

41:04.640 --> 41:08.880
Liz and Stew's only hope
of investment lies
with property developer,

41:08.920 --> 41:10.920
Tim Gee.

41:10.960 --> 41:14.560
[Tim] The sites that
we're offering are
very prominent, very public,

41:14.600 --> 41:17.960
and would be the first choice
of any restaurant operator.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.160
Hello.

41:19.880 --> 41:21.200
How's it going?

41:21.240 --> 41:23.240
[Tim] I want to probe them
a bit more,

41:23.280 --> 41:25.680
what they think the next
steps are going to be,

41:25.720 --> 41:30.080
and, you know,
just get a scale
of their ambition and ability

41:30.120 --> 41:35.000
before you can ever make
a consideration as to whether
you want to invest or not.

41:35.040 --> 41:40.360
[narrator] For the past month,
Liz and Stew have traded as
a pop-up in London's Boxpark.

41:40.400 --> 41:44.360
Now, they want
£200,000 to become
a full-time restaurant.

41:48.840 --> 41:50.800
[Tim] I wanted to start
by talking about the menu,

41:50.840 --> 41:53.400
because you've got a couple
of sample menus.

41:53.440 --> 41:56.400
The one that you presented
today, is that what
you're currently offering?

41:56.440 --> 42:00.400
The menu we're offering
today is just the one
we've tried at Boxpark.

42:00.440 --> 42:03.640
Um, but, the other burgers
on the menu we have
tested as well,

42:03.680 --> 42:07.320
and it's just something
that we want to have
in our restaurant.

42:07.360 --> 42:10.440
We never wanna have
a massive menu.

42:10.480 --> 42:13.440
We always want to, kind of,
keep it fairly simple.

42:13.480 --> 42:16.600
[Tim] It's so key to have
a good, cohesive menu

42:16.640 --> 42:20.200
that's going to
not ruin the opportunity
of groups to visit.

42:20.240 --> 42:22.680
You're not going to have
that one person going,
'There's nothing for me."

42:23.360 --> 42:25.320
Um, and to do it well.

42:25.360 --> 42:29.000
I'd like to move on to,
what is this restaurant going
to look like in you mind?

42:29.040 --> 42:35.000
I think, kind of our vision
for, maybe, the first site
would be fairly small.

42:35.040 --> 42:36.800
Like, 30, 40 seats.

42:36.840 --> 42:40.000
-Similar to where you are?
-Yeah, similar to there.

42:40.040 --> 42:43.880
We won't be looking
at opening, straight off
the bat, like a...

42:43.920 --> 42:45.640
150-seater restaurant.

42:45.680 --> 42:48.520
'Cause we kinda wanna always
keep that small,
independent feel,

42:48.560 --> 42:51.960
and we think that's the way
the, kind of, burger market
is going anyway.

42:53.120 --> 42:55.000
[narrator]
The meeting's almost over.

42:55.040 --> 42:58.920
Now, Tim has to decide
whether he's ready to
discuss a potential offer.

42:59.600 --> 43:01.400
Where's the dream?

43:01.440 --> 43:05.040
You know, it'd be nice to have
maybe one in London or two,
and then kind of

43:05.080 --> 43:06.920
branch out to other cities,

43:06.960 --> 43:11.160
Before Boxpark, we were
looking at potential
restaurant sites in London,

43:11.200 --> 43:15.360
and to get into a site,
you have to have
upfront of 100k...

43:15.400 --> 43:16.560
-Yeah.
-Or more.

43:16.600 --> 43:19.280
There's still such a barrier
to entry for us.

43:19.320 --> 43:22.520
The reality is,
maybe the first site
needs to be located

43:22.560 --> 43:24.120
where that's
not such a challenge.

43:24.160 --> 43:28.160
-[Liz] Yeah.
-It can be an enormous amount
of money.

43:28.200 --> 43:29.960
As of today, they're not ready

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
to step straight into
a restaurant, in my opinion.

43:33.040 --> 43:35.960
It's crucial to see
that they're able
to translate their passion

43:36.000 --> 43:39.680
and great food into a team
and a public environment.

43:39.720 --> 43:41.200
-[Tim] Really good...
-Yeah.

43:41.240 --> 43:42.600
-To meet you.
-Yeah, yeah.

43:42.640 --> 43:45.040
They've got a lot to prove
to me tomorrow.

43:47.160 --> 43:49.800
Tomorrow it's really important
for us just to demonstrate

43:49.840 --> 43:53.120
that we're capable of
doing this.

43:53.160 --> 43:56.400
Take this concept
and roll it to, um,
into more sites.

44:12.440 --> 44:14.320
The two restaurants
are in with a chance

44:14.360 --> 44:16.480
of a life-changing investment.

44:16.520 --> 44:19.840
But the investors
have serious questions
about both ideas.

44:19.880 --> 44:23.920
Today's final service for the
paying public will be what
makes up their mind.

44:23.960 --> 44:28.480
Right now, everything
hangs in the balance.

44:28.520 --> 44:31.520
[narrator] And with no offers
on the table for either
restaurant,

44:31.560 --> 44:34.960
it all comes down to today,
to convince the investors.

44:40.440 --> 44:42.080
-So what would you like
to try?
-[man] Mud Bath.

44:42.120 --> 44:44.000
Mud Bath? Yeah.

44:44.040 --> 44:47.760
So we're giving away
50 free pots to the first
customers at 1:00 p.m. today.

44:47.800 --> 44:52.160
[narrator] At Naked Dough,
Jen and Hannah are taking
to the streets of Manchester

44:52.200 --> 44:54.800
to drum up
a full lunchtime service.

44:54.840 --> 44:57.440
[Hannah]
So this is Salted Caramel
and Mud Bath.

44:57.480 --> 45:02.200
[Jen] If you guys are free
at 1:00 p.m. for a bit
of cookie-dough sampling...

45:03.600 --> 45:05.720
So you've got Nutella
and Kinder Bueno

45:05.760 --> 45:07.960
and Salted Caramel
with Honeycomb.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.840
-How's it going?
-It's good.

45:09.880 --> 45:11.920
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

45:11.960 --> 45:13.440
[Jen] People are giving good
feedback, and I think
we're getting some good buzz

45:13.480 --> 45:16.760
for today's lunch service,
so, yeah.

45:16.800 --> 45:20.600
-They like it when they try it?
-They do seem to like it
when they try it, so...

45:20.640 --> 45:22.160
[Fred] Ah, let's see what
these two think.

45:22.200 --> 45:24.280
-Do you want to try that?
-Would you guys like
to try some?

45:24.320 --> 45:27.480
It's raw, edible cookie dough.
So just like you used
to have when you were a kid.

45:27.520 --> 45:30.040
This is Oreo.
So it's vegan
cookies and cream.

45:30.080 --> 45:31.360
Their response has been great,

45:31.400 --> 45:33.600
um, and people seem to be
really keen to pop down.

45:33.640 --> 45:35.800
If you guys have time,
pop down.

45:35.840 --> 45:39.400
So we're really hoping
to have a buzz
in the shop today.

45:39.440 --> 45:43.160
Do you like it? Are you guys
going to come buy it
at 1:00, 2:30?

45:43.200 --> 45:44.560
-Yeah.
-Brilliant, thanks a lot.

45:44.600 --> 45:46.680
Well done. That's good.

45:46.720 --> 45:47.960
Yeah, it's brilliant.

45:50.640 --> 45:56.160
[narrator] In 15 minutes,
both restaurants open for
business for the last time.

45:56.200 --> 46:00.200
[Stew] Let's keep talking to
each other, make sure we're
going at the same pace, yeah?

46:00.240 --> 46:01.640
We got it.

46:01.680 --> 46:04.280
[Jen] There's a really
big queue!
[Hannah] Is there?

46:04.320 --> 46:06.800
Yay! Welcome to Naked Dough!

46:06.840 --> 46:08.760
-Hi, guys!
-Oh, so exciting!

46:10.520 --> 46:12.880
[man]
We're going to have
an amazing day today.

46:12.920 --> 46:15.840
Nice and busy.
Look at the queue.
Big smiles.

46:15.880 --> 46:17.480
Do you need any help
deciding?

46:18.400 --> 46:19.840
One Black Bear, one brisket.

46:19.880 --> 46:21.600
-Yeah.
-And I got some fries,
all right?

46:21.640 --> 46:24.640
Do you guys know,
you get two scoops per pot?

46:24.680 --> 46:27.840
So you can, kind of,
mix and match
whichever ones you like.

46:27.880 --> 46:30.440
[Jen] Enjoy! Thank you.
[Hannah] Feel free to draw on
the tables.

46:30.480 --> 46:32.680
[Hannah] Get creative.
[Jen] Enjoy! Have a seat.

46:34.240 --> 46:36.440
[narrator] Jamie Barber
and Shruti Ajitsaria

46:36.480 --> 46:39.200
are the first to arrive at
Naked Dough.

46:39.240 --> 46:41.440
[Jen] Hi, guys, welcome!

46:41.480 --> 46:45.960
I'm still here because
the idea of it is genius.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.800
At the end of the day,
I am not the demographic.

46:48.840 --> 46:51.400
The demographic
that likes this product

46:51.440 --> 46:53.800
is female, 18 to 25-year-olds.

46:53.840 --> 46:56.760
So I can't be swayed too
much by own impression.

46:56.800 --> 47:00.280
What I want to see is what
that generation thinks
about the product.

47:00.320 --> 47:01.800
And then I might have
a different view.

47:04.720 --> 47:08.200
I'm really looking forward
to seeing how
the user experience goes,

47:08.240 --> 47:11.360
so how they make
the consumers feel special.

47:11.400 --> 47:13.640
And I'm also really interested
to speak to the people
eating it

47:13.680 --> 47:16.320
to understand, for myself,
whether they think
the portions are too big

47:16.360 --> 47:17.600
and whether they would return.

47:18.920 --> 47:22.160
-So, um...
-There's no Chris.

47:26.360 --> 47:28.480
-[Fred] Chris. How are you?
-How are you, Fred?

47:28.520 --> 47:30.680
-Good, thank you. Very good.
-Good.

47:30.720 --> 47:33.280
So tell me, what do you
think about Naked Dough?

47:33.320 --> 47:36.360
Something's been bothering
me about the business.

47:36.400 --> 47:41.120
So I then had a look
at their financials
in a bit more detail,

47:41.160 --> 47:44.400
and what that
shows to me is,

47:44.440 --> 47:47.080
people are excited
to try it,
but they don't come back.

47:47.120 --> 47:51.680
-Right.
-And if you don't have
repeat custom...

47:51.720 --> 47:54.720
You very quickly
don't have a business.

47:54.760 --> 48:00.240
It's a nice, exciting brand
but, for me,
it's too high-risk.

48:00.280 --> 48:03.280
Well, if you don't think it's
worth your money, there's
nothing you can do.

48:03.320 --> 48:05.160
-You gotta go.
-Exactly.

48:05.200 --> 48:07.440
-All right, well,
thank you very much, Chris.
-Thanks a lot.

48:07.480 --> 48:09.600
-Have a good day. Take care.
-Thank you.

48:09.640 --> 48:11.720
[Hannah] It seems like Chris
hasn't turned up.

48:11.760 --> 48:14.960
He asked for our financials
last night, which I
sent over to him,

48:15.000 --> 48:18.000
and, uh, potentially, he didn't
see what he, you know,

48:18.040 --> 48:21.360
he didn't feel comfortable
with it, he maybe thought
it was too much of a risk,

48:21.400 --> 48:25.320
which is fair enough.
There are two investors
still in the shop,

48:25.360 --> 48:27.520
so there's still a chance
we might get the investment.

48:30.440 --> 48:32.040
[narrator]
At Black Bear Burger,

48:32.080 --> 48:34.720
their only hope of investment
lies with Tim Gee.

48:36.120 --> 48:37.640
[Tim]
Today is very, very important.

48:37.680 --> 48:40.920
It's very, very different,
serving burgers
to two investors

48:40.960 --> 48:42.600
,in a quiet environment

48:42.640 --> 48:46.000
to flipping the tables on
a 30-seat restaurant.

48:46.040 --> 48:47.800
Probably for
the first time ever,

48:47.840 --> 48:50.880
because they have been,
historically, a street
food operator.

48:50.920 --> 48:54.200
Out of the food truck,
into a property.

48:54.240 --> 48:55.960
Um, that's why we're here.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.440
Can you do this?

48:57.480 --> 48:59.440
How hungry are you?

48:59.480 --> 49:01.920
-I'm quite hungry.
So I'm thinking--
-Why don't you get...

49:01.960 --> 49:03.080
Black Bear and nuggets?

49:03.120 --> 49:04.480
Let's give it a shot, yeah?

49:04.520 --> 49:05.760
Okay, I'll get on from here.

49:08.960 --> 49:11.680
All right, here you go, guys,
a Black Bear and fries.

49:11.720 --> 49:13.440
What are you going to go for?
Chicken nuggets?

49:13.480 --> 49:14.640
-Chicken nuggets.
-[Liz] Yeah?

49:14.680 --> 49:16.320
Chicken nuggets, brisket...

49:16.360 --> 49:19.000
[Tim] There's a good,
good mix of people here.

49:19.040 --> 49:24.040
I'm interested,
there's a family come in
and it's a great buzz.

49:24.080 --> 49:27.320
[Liz] I'm actually
really enjoying it today.
I know what I'm doing.

49:27.360 --> 49:29.040
The other night,
on our soft launch,

49:29.080 --> 49:33.840
I was even finding it
difficult to, like, smile,
talk to people,

49:33.880 --> 49:37.760
'cause I was so anxious
and nervous, and I
wasn't really being myself.

49:37.800 --> 49:43.240
Well, now I'm able to
talk to the customers and
provide a really good service.

49:47.600 --> 49:50.080
-Here you go. All right?
-Good man.

49:50.120 --> 49:51.400
It does look good.

49:56.680 --> 49:57.960
What'd you think?

49:58.000 --> 50:00.080
-It is very nice.
-It is very good, yeah.

50:00.120 --> 50:02.440
Don't think I could
eat the whole thing,
to be quite honest.

50:02.480 --> 50:04.440
They said we could take
it home, though.

50:04.480 --> 50:07.160
-Because freezer.
-I've probably had enough.

50:07.200 --> 50:09.440
-No, I've demolished it.
-You've demolished it.

50:09.480 --> 50:11.480
-I loved it.
-So, you're a big fan.

50:11.520 --> 50:12.880
Perfect.

50:12.920 --> 50:14.480
-Have you had it before
anywhere?
-[man] No, no.

50:14.520 --> 50:16.240
-No, first time.
-Really rich, isn't it?

50:16.280 --> 50:17.600
How do you feel about
the portion?

50:17.640 --> 50:18.960
Do you think you're going
to be able to finish that?

50:19.520 --> 50:21.160
Um, probably not.

50:21.200 --> 50:24.600
-At one go, we got two scoops.
-One scoop would've been...

50:24.640 --> 50:26.200
I do really enjoy it.

50:26.240 --> 50:30.040
I don't feel worried
with the investors
speaking to customers.

50:30.080 --> 50:31.680
Um, I want them to be honest.

50:31.720 --> 50:35.160
We can't improve as a business
without some critical
feedback.

50:36.120 --> 50:39.000
Do you find it super sweet?

50:39.040 --> 50:40.720
It's just perfect for me.

50:40.760 --> 50:43.440
I used to, I used to sit
at home and eat raw
cookie-dough, anyway.

50:43.480 --> 50:46.360
-Right.
-Can I ask how you're getting
on with it?

50:46.400 --> 50:47.720
I think, for me,
one scoop
would be enough.

50:47.760 --> 50:50.520
Generally speaking,
people like the branding.

50:50.560 --> 50:53.520
Generally speaking, people
like the product,

50:53.560 --> 50:56.560
but, mostly, in small doses.
And I think that's
going to be the real issue.

50:56.600 --> 51:01.280
A very, very small proportion
were able to finish an
entire tub of cookie dough.

51:01.320 --> 51:02.560
[man]
It's tasty, but too sweet.

51:02.600 --> 51:04.440
-Yeah, too much.
-[Shruti] Too much?

51:04.480 --> 51:06.320
On a positive note,

51:06.360 --> 51:07.600
there was a lot of demand

51:07.640 --> 51:10.440
for people to try
lots of different flavors.

51:10.480 --> 51:12.320
It was definitely
a fun product.

51:12.360 --> 51:15.080
People wanted
to take photos of it.
People wanted to share it.

51:15.120 --> 51:17.360
People wanted to say
that they've been.

51:17.400 --> 51:20.560
And I think if they can
match the product

51:20.600 --> 51:22.280
to that Instagram ability,

51:22.320 --> 51:25.400
they might have the kernel of
something really, really sexy.

51:25.440 --> 51:27.960
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

51:28.000 --> 51:32.120
I think they need to figure out
how they're going to sell
smaller portions,

51:32.160 --> 51:35.440
while still being able
to charge enough
to make this a viable business.

51:35.480 --> 51:37.320
So, I'm gonna go away now,
I'm gonna have a coffee,

51:37.360 --> 51:39.280
I'm gonna have a really,
really good think,

51:39.320 --> 51:41.840
I'm going to make a list
in my own head, just to
the things I love about it,

51:41.880 --> 51:44.840
and there are a lot,
and things
I'm not sure about,

51:44.880 --> 51:47.640
and then I'm gonna have a
sense of what I'm going to
do next.

51:47.680 --> 51:50.120
Got the Black Bear
with nuggets and fries.

51:50.160 --> 51:51.520
Fabulous.

51:53.640 --> 51:55.720
The food was as good
as it was yesterday.

51:55.760 --> 51:58.280
You know,
it was great yesterday,
I want very consistent.

51:58.320 --> 52:00.840
Visually, the taste,
perfectly cooked.

52:00.880 --> 52:02.320
Exactly the same.

52:02.360 --> 52:04.720
And the service, Liz,
she's good.

52:06.080 --> 52:07.400
The question for us is,

52:07.440 --> 52:10.240
can we take this fantastic
street-food operation,

52:10.280 --> 52:12.640
and turn it
into a successful restaurant

52:12.680 --> 52:16.960
that is just as good
as they are at street-food
from day one?

52:17.000 --> 52:18.360
That was wicked.

52:18.400 --> 52:20.200
All right,
let's get out of here.
Come on, guys.

52:20.240 --> 52:21.760
-[exclaims indistinctly]
-[laughs]

52:25.400 --> 52:27.240
[narrator] Lunch is over.

52:27.280 --> 52:29.960
Now the pressure is on
the investors.

52:30.000 --> 52:33.680
They have to decide whether
the ideas are worth
their money.

52:35.360 --> 52:36.880
-How are you, girls?
-Good, thank you.

52:36.920 --> 52:38.480
-Good, Fred.
-So...

52:38.520 --> 52:40.560
The investors have been
given a deadline.

52:40.600 --> 52:44.440
-Okay.
-They have one hour to come
back and make you an offer.

52:44.480 --> 52:46.600
-Okay.
-If they're back in that hour,

52:46.640 --> 52:49.440
it's game on.
If they're not,
then it's game over.

52:49.480 --> 52:51.000
How do you feel about that?

52:51.040 --> 52:52.760
It's a long time to wait.

52:57.760 --> 53:02.320
[narrator]
Jen and Hannah came
looking for £250,000.

53:02.360 --> 53:07.360
Jamie Barber
and Shruti Ajitsaria
are both still interested.

53:09.440 --> 53:11.200
If they're to make an
investment,

53:11.240 --> 53:14.080
they have until 6:30 p.m.
to return to the restaurant.

53:18.520 --> 53:20.920
-This is what it comes
down to.
-[Hannah] Yes.

53:34.560 --> 53:36.840
-Oh, you've done great.
-Thank you.

53:36.880 --> 53:40.320
You went out there,
drummed up the business,

53:40.360 --> 53:43.040
got people to learn
about your product.

53:43.080 --> 53:45.160
-I really enjoyed today.
-Yeah, today was good.

53:50.880 --> 53:52.720
How long is it?

53:52.760 --> 53:54.920
[Fred] We've got another
15 minutes.

53:54.960 --> 53:56.880
-Another 15 minutes.
-Yeah.

54:00.120 --> 54:02.760
We still believe
in the product.
We're not gonna stop.

54:02.800 --> 54:05.720
We still think Naked Dough
is going to be a big brand.

54:06.520 --> 54:07.920
That's true.

54:27.920 --> 54:30.600
-Girls. The time is up.
-Time.

54:32.800 --> 54:34.600
-Okay.
-[Fred] They're not coming.

54:34.640 --> 54:35.520
Okay.

54:36.320 --> 54:37.280
I'm sorry.

54:38.720 --> 54:40.520
I'm gutted for you,
but in the same time,

54:40.560 --> 54:42.800
you know, maybe
it wasn't the right fit.

54:44.000 --> 54:44.920
Maybe.

54:46.600 --> 54:48.200
[Jamie] I think these guys
have been fantastic.

54:48.240 --> 54:50.880
I rate them as entrepreneurs.
I think they are hungry,

54:50.920 --> 54:54.320
I think they will overcome odds
and get to where they need to.

54:54.360 --> 54:57.560
But I think, they're
probably six months
too early,

54:57.600 --> 55:00.640
because all we've got at
the moment is pure data,

55:00.680 --> 55:04.600
and the pure data is
they've got one store
which has got six months

55:04.640 --> 55:07.720
of month-on-month
declining sales.

55:07.760 --> 55:11.560
And they've got an idea,
and that idea
is not perfected yet,

55:11.600 --> 55:13.520
and, unfortunately,
in this case,

55:13.560 --> 55:16.000
the investment
just doesn't stack up.

55:16.040 --> 55:18.600
[Shruti] I actually thought
the branding looked beautiful

55:18.640 --> 55:20.800
and I thought it was
a really exciting concept.

55:20.840 --> 55:24.680
I really liked them and I
really wanted to like
the business, actually.

55:24.720 --> 55:27.200
As much as I
wanted to love the product,
unfortunately I didn't,

55:27.240 --> 55:31.000
and so, for me, that means
I can't invest.

55:31.040 --> 55:35.120
[Jen] I feel gutted.
We put our heart and soul
into everything that we do.

55:35.160 --> 55:38.040
At the same time,
it's been a really good
learning curve.

55:38.080 --> 55:39.920
-Yeah.
-Um...

55:39.960 --> 55:42.000
[Hannah] And we really
appreciate all the advice

55:42.040 --> 55:45.240
and thoughts and opinions
that people have had
on our business.

55:45.280 --> 55:47.520
I still think we've got a good
thing going.

55:47.560 --> 55:48.720
Yeah.

55:48.760 --> 55:51.200
-C'est la vie, Fred.
-C'est la vie.

56:04.560 --> 56:06.120
[narrator]
At Black Bear Burger,

56:06.160 --> 56:10.440
Stew and Liz
came looking for £200,000.

56:10.480 --> 56:14.280
Tim Gee has until 8:00 p.m.
to walk through the door.

56:27.080 --> 56:28.440
Only ten minutes.

56:30.080 --> 56:31.440
20 minutes to go.

56:31.480 --> 56:32.640
[chuckles nervously]

56:44.200 --> 56:46.440
Where's your head at right now?

56:46.480 --> 56:47.920
We'll just have to wait
and see.

56:59.840 --> 57:00.720
How long we got?

57:01.920 --> 57:02.880
Six.

57:03.520 --> 57:04.800
Six minutes.

57:33.040 --> 57:34.120
Guys.

57:35.120 --> 57:36.200
The time is up.

57:36.240 --> 57:37.560
Time's up?

57:39.240 --> 57:41.600
It's kind of been...
The whole experience is...

57:41.640 --> 57:44.240
It's been a big learning
curve, but it's actually...

57:44.280 --> 57:48.080
Shown ourselves
that we can actually
run a restaurant service.

57:48.120 --> 57:51.000
We're gonna draw
on the experiences
that we've had here

57:51.040 --> 57:56.400
and, uh, you know, really,
kind of, set up a
successful restaurant from it.

57:56.440 --> 57:58.280
We've done it on our
own up 'til this point,

57:58.320 --> 58:00.120
so we're going to continue
doing that.

58:02.160 --> 58:06.040
[Tim] Unfortunately, we won't
be pursuing our interest
in Black Bear.

58:06.080 --> 58:09.480
There's no denying
that, currently,
their menu is limited.

58:09.520 --> 58:12.920
You know, we would need
to see more development
on that front

58:12.960 --> 58:16.120
and just a general confidence
that they're able to run
a business

58:16.160 --> 58:17.800
and not just a street
food pop up.

58:19.640 --> 58:22.600
There is a sense of regret.
I looked at the business plan.

58:22.640 --> 58:25.400
I ate the burger.
I met the people.

58:25.440 --> 58:27.400
It was all,
it was all wonderful.

58:27.440 --> 58:31.800
Um, but, you know, it's
got to be a perfect marriage
isn't it?

58:31.840 --> 58:33.520
And we're just not there.

58:33.560 --> 58:36.480
We don't often give ourselves
a lot of praise and a pat
on the back,

58:36.520 --> 58:40.400
but I think
going through this together,
has made us a lot stronger,

58:40.440 --> 58:44.440
um, and I think it's
been a really, really,
positive experience for us.

58:46.640 --> 58:49.360
[Fred] What do you need to do
to secure an investment?

58:49.400 --> 58:52.560
Naked Dough and Black
Bear Burger worked so hard
at this,

58:52.600 --> 58:53.800
and yet it wasn't enough.

58:54.520 --> 58:56.000
This is a tough business

58:56.040 --> 58:57.680
and I wish them every success.
