02:38.992 --> 02:41.622
Shit. Justin!

02:42.095 --> 02:44.935
Justin! Justin!

02:45.431 --> 02:47.921
I gotta go!

02:59.012 --> 03:01.532
<i>Some say
I don't play well with others.</i>

03:01.981 --> 03:04.091
<i>I was a damn good
detective in Chicago...</i>

03:04.484 --> 03:05.944
<i>until a disagreement</i>
<i>with my boss encouraged me...</i>

03:06.252 --> 03:07.682
<i>to pack it up and make a change.</i>

03:07.987 --> 03:10.677
<i>So I put the Windy City in my rearview
and</i> <i>headed to the Sunshine State.</i>

03:11.157 --> 03:13.737
<i>Kick back. Play some golf.
Work on my tan.</i>

03:14.194 --> 03:15.654
<i>Maybe write the occasional
speeding ticket.</i>

03:17.096 --> 03:19.436
<i>Yeah. Well, that didn't work out.</i>

03:26.239 --> 03:27.989
Damn it, Jim. Pick up.

03:28.341 --> 03:29.481
<i>You've reached Jim Longworth.</i>

03:29.742 --> 03:31.492
<i>I'm either out seeking justice</i>
<i>or trying to break 80.</i>

03:31.844 --> 03:33.574
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

03:40.753 --> 03:42.773
- Now he's calling me.
- Don't answer it.

03:43.156 --> 03:44.086
Hello.

03:44.324 --> 03:46.054
- Carlos, he with you?
- I'm not here.

03:46.392 --> 03:48.062
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's right here.

03:51.631 --> 03:54.411
Ah, you must've heard.
I'm four over at the turn.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.951
Birdied three, seven and 10,
with a lip-out at 11.

03:57.337 --> 03:59.007
- Yeah, that's great, but we got a situation.

03:59.339 --> 04:01.089
<i>Yeah, we do. I'm four holes</i>
<i>away from breaking 80...</i>

04:01.441 --> 04:02.731
<i>for the first time in my life.</i>

04:03.009 --> 04:04.849
A woman's body was found
in Fisheating Creek.

04:05.211 --> 04:08.551
Well, she's not gonna be
any deader an hour from now.

04:11.217 --> 04:12.297
Hey! Come on!

04:12.552 --> 04:15.042
And there's this tag or message...
whatever...

04:15.488 --> 04:17.567
popping up all over town.
I think it might be related.

04:17.957 --> 04:19.447
<i>Who found the body?</i>

04:19.759 --> 04:22.309
Underage kid and her boyfriend
fell asleep in the swamp last night.

04:22.762 --> 04:25.282
- How underage are we talking?
<i>- I don't know- 16, 17.</i>

04:25.732 --> 04:27.282
What was she doing out there?
She doing the guy?

04:27.600 --> 04:29.910
- I didn't ask her that.
- What the hell did you ask?

04:30.336 --> 04:32.586
<i>Nothing. I'm still trying</i>
<i>to find her parents.</i>

04:33.006 --> 04:35.346
Listen, stick her in a room,
don't let her talk to anyone.

04:35.775 --> 04:37.505
I want a clean shot at her
before her parents shut her up.

04:37.844 --> 04:38.694
<i>Jim...</i>

04:42.548 --> 04:44.218
Call your wife, open your office.

04:44.550 --> 04:46.720
It's Sunday. My office is closed.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.050
Yeah. I just opened it.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.688
Uh, excuse me. Yeah, uh...

04:51.124 --> 04:53.054
See this ball?

04:53.426 --> 04:56.116
This ball is part of a
murder investigation.

04:56.596 --> 04:59.726
Anybody messes with this ball,
you go to jail.

05:05.738 --> 05:06.728
<i>Gracias.</i>

05:06.973 --> 05:08.783
What's wrong with you?

05:12.245 --> 05:14.675
No scar tissue, no water in her lungs.

05:16.783 --> 05:19.563
Nothing in her stomach.

05:20.053 --> 05:22.923
Her identity and cause of death
inconclusive without the head.

05:23.423 --> 05:25.853
- You might wanna give that a minute.
- Damn it.

05:26.292 --> 05:27.582
You wanna see the body?

05:27.860 --> 05:29.440
No. She's dead. I wanna talk to the girl.

05:29.762 --> 05:30.842
Any word from the parents?

05:31.097 --> 05:33.267
Her mom's M.I.A... apparently
not unusual for the weekend...

05:33.666 --> 05:35.886
especially with her husband
on a poker run in the Keys.

05:36.302 --> 05:39.262
- Any of these geniuses got a record?
- Law-abiding, far as we know.

05:39.772 --> 05:42.022
- Where's the boy?
- Local kid.

05:43.576 --> 05:46.326
Justin... Brussard, 22.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.221
- I sent him home.
- Why?

05:50.616 --> 05:53.866
He vomited all over my keyboard
giving his statement.

05:54.420 --> 05:56.610
I got a call in to the girl's folks.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.273
She's 16. You can't talk to her
without a parent or guardian.

06:04.797 --> 06:06.317
Jim Longworth.

06:06.632 --> 06:07.562
You're a cop?

06:07.800 --> 06:09.030
Lieutenant.

06:09.302 --> 06:11.172
Oh!

06:11.537 --> 06:13.027
You need anything?

06:13.339 --> 06:16.119
You want something to eat?
Something to drink?

06:16.609 --> 06:19.009
Would you feel more comfortable if we
waited till we located one of your parents?

06:19.445 --> 06:21.255
My parents? Good luck with that.

06:21.614 --> 06:24.394
So you're okay talking to me then?

06:24.884 --> 06:28.254
Oh, we sent your, uh... whatever he
is... boyfriend or whatever home.

06:28.821 --> 06:30.961
- Puked all over my partner's keyboard.
- Mmm.

06:31.357 --> 06:32.847
He drinks too much.

06:33.159 --> 06:35.239
Did he have sex with you?

06:35.628 --> 06:37.618
No.

06:37.997 --> 06:40.307
And what's this got to do
with the woman without the head?

06:40.733 --> 06:42.843
I don't know yet.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.406
He said you guys got out there
a little after 10:00...

06:45.805 --> 06:47.615
and stayed out there all night.

06:47.974 --> 06:50.344
Did you hear or see anything?

06:50.777 --> 06:52.037
You mean related to the woman?

06:52.311 --> 06:54.531
Yeah. Did you hear or see anything...

06:54.947 --> 06:56.817
that might help us identify who she was?

06:57.183 --> 07:00.023
Like the person or persons
who might have dumped her there.

07:00.520 --> 07:03.920
- Maybe she died there.
- Oh, maybe. We don't think so.

07:04.490 --> 07:06.070
Well, what do you think happened?

07:06.392 --> 07:08.352
I think she was killed somewhere else...

07:08.728 --> 07:11.068
and then dumped there
so an alligator could destroy the evidence.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.950
I didn't hear anything.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.559
Hmm.

07:19.505 --> 07:21.555
What about the spot?

07:21.941 --> 07:23.691
Anything special about
the spot for you two?

07:24.043 --> 07:25.443
No.

07:25.745 --> 07:26.825
No special meaning?

07:27.079 --> 07:29.569
No. Just a place to go.

07:30.016 --> 07:33.266
A place for other people maybe...
like young people?

07:33.820 --> 07:35.870
To party, get drunk, try sex.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.541
It's kind of a dumb place to dump a
body, right, if someone knew that.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.570
How do you know she didn't, like...

07:44.030 --> 07:45.730
float there from upriver or something?

07:46.065 --> 07:48.085
Doesn't figure that way forensically.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.808
Are you like a forensics expert?

07:52.371 --> 07:54.981
I'm an expert on all
things homicidal, Erin.

07:55.441 --> 07:57.311
There isn't much about
murder I don't know...

07:57.677 --> 07:59.257
or can't figure out...

07:59.579 --> 08:01.749
if I just keep asking the right questions.

08:31.744 --> 08:33.114
Holy shit!

08:33.412 --> 08:35.902
Son of a bitch!

08:36.349 --> 08:37.929
Is this absolutely necessary?

08:38.251 --> 08:39.861
You wanna die of infection?

08:40.186 --> 08:43.376
- Looked pretty hygienic to me.
- Everyone looks hygienic till the blood work comes back.

08:46.425 --> 08:49.495
Either that's an exit wound,
or all the surgeons in Chicago are drunks.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.959
- My captain shot me.
- On purpose?

08:52.331 --> 08:54.411
He thought I slept with his wife.

08:54.800 --> 08:55.850
I didn't.

08:56.102 --> 08:58.092
But I was the only one
in the department that didn't.

08:58.471 --> 09:00.371
Good boy.

09:00.740 --> 09:02.440
Feels like it's gonna
hurt like hell later on.

09:02.775 --> 09:04.325
I can give you something for the pain...

09:04.644 --> 09:06.544
but a six-pack of beer
will do the same trick.

09:06.913 --> 09:08.583
And then if I give you
something for the pain...

09:08.915 --> 09:10.845
and later on you want that six-pack,
it's not good.

09:11.217 --> 09:12.707
Callie is it?

09:14.120 --> 09:15.670
Oh. Yeah.

09:15.988 --> 09:17.978
How long am I gonna have
to wear this thing?

09:18.357 --> 09:19.647
Why? Are you in some kind of hurry?

09:19.926 --> 09:21.156
I have a Titleist with a perfect lie...

09:21.427 --> 09:22.827
sitting on the 14th fairway at Belleair...

09:23.129 --> 09:26.119
waiting for me to break 80
for the first time in my life.

09:26.632 --> 09:28.302
With that swing, I'm not surprised.

09:28.634 --> 09:31.264
- Sign, date and initial where indicated.
- What am I signing?

09:31.737 --> 09:33.437
You're releasing the medical center
from liability...

09:33.773 --> 09:36.583
should you lose your hand or die from
infection due to my incompetence.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.366
I'm not signing this.

09:38.644 --> 09:40.374
You will if you want your pants back.

10:00.733 --> 10:02.223
- There you go.
- Thanks.

10:08.941 --> 10:11.081
That thing working?

10:11.477 --> 10:12.787
No.

10:13.079 --> 10:14.749
You lose your uniform again?

10:15.081 --> 10:17.011
I'm just saying.

10:17.383 --> 10:20.073
Hit the gym once in a while, every
little thing won't throw your back out.

10:20.553 --> 10:22.923
Yeah, we could be workout partners...

10:23.356 --> 10:25.166
spend even more time together.

10:26.959 --> 10:30.469
I got Missing Persons files
from Orlando, Ocala, Tampa, Miami.

10:31.063 --> 10:32.993
Nothing promising so far.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.676
Still waiting on Jacksonville, Naples.

10:36.102 --> 10:38.762
Naples? That's, like, old people.
She wasn't that old.

10:39.238 --> 10:40.578
Maybe she was visiting relatives.

10:40.873 --> 10:42.453
Dressed like that? I don't think so.

10:42.775 --> 10:44.145
What's wrong with the way she was dressed?

10:44.443 --> 10:46.113
Someone she was visiting
would've called it in...

10:46.445 --> 10:48.785
if she was missing, don't you think?

10:49.215 --> 10:51.845
We may not have <i>her </i> head, compadre,
but we still have ours.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.098
<i>The club manager called.</i>

10:54.453 --> 10:57.733
He's getting complaints that you cordoned off
an area around your ball on the 14th fairway.

10:58.290 --> 11:01.100
- I want to finish the round.
- It's gonna be weeks before you can swing a club, man.

11:01.594 --> 11:03.464
- Go pick up your ball.
- I'm getting medical treatment.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.699
I'll be fine by the end of the week.

11:06.065 --> 11:08.435
"Esophageal abrasions."
What's that, like heartburn?

11:08.868 --> 11:11.648
- What causes that?
- Acid reflux, spicy foods, you.

11:12.138 --> 11:14.328
- How spicy?
- Spicy.

11:14.740 --> 11:16.110
Habanero spicy.

11:16.409 --> 11:17.989
- What's that test called again?
- What test?

11:18.310 --> 11:19.950
The "barnuclear" something.

11:20.279 --> 11:22.679
- Barnacles?
- Yeah, that's what I said.

11:23.115 --> 11:25.045
- Skin graft to determine race?
- Yeah, that one.

11:25.418 --> 11:27.528
- She's white.
- And tan.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.760
Any way to determine
if the tan is natural or...

11:30.122 --> 11:31.612
or the result of a tanning booth?

11:31.924 --> 11:34.264
No. Both are caused
from exposure to U.V. rays.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.564
Exposed evenly, like from a tanning bed...

11:36.929 --> 11:39.179
or mottled like a native?

11:39.598 --> 11:41.708
Fine. I'll do a "barnucleous."

11:42.101 --> 11:44.881
- Did you find out if she had any kids?
- Pelvic density suggests not.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.331
But you'll do a test to determine anyway?

11:47.707 --> 11:49.577
Hey, if she's anything like my mom...

11:49.942 --> 11:52.052
She and my sister talk five times a day,
and they hate each other.

11:52.445 --> 11:53.555
Whatever the hell that means.

11:53.813 --> 11:55.303
It means...

11:56.449 --> 11:58.119
I need a female perspective.

12:06.859 --> 12:08.349
- There you go.
- Thanks.

12:10.529 --> 12:12.609
Hey. I was hoping I'd catch you.

12:12.998 --> 12:14.728
Already not sure how I feel about that.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.737
I just wanted
to run something by you.

12:17.069 --> 12:18.819
I just came by to get my check,
and then I'm gonna go.

12:19.171 --> 12:21.101
See, I have this theory...
well, two theories actually.

12:21.474 --> 12:23.434
Now I need someone like yourself
to just walk it through with me.

12:23.809 --> 12:25.739
Don't you have coworkers
for things like that?

12:26.112 --> 12:27.892
I do, yeah. Lots of coworkers.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.327
♪♪ And a partner, I guess. Technically speaking.

12:30.716 --> 12:32.206
Heads up the local highway patrol.

12:32.518 --> 12:34.798
Actually really like this song,
which is kind of weird.

12:35.221 --> 12:37.061
Anyway, yeah, he's a nice guy.
Great wife.

12:37.423 --> 12:38.913
- They have me over for dinner every Sunday.
- Wow.

12:39.225 --> 12:40.895
But he's not a very good cop.

12:41.227 --> 12:43.887
He's also not a health care professional
or a woman.

12:44.363 --> 12:45.853
I need a woman's perspective.

12:46.165 --> 12:47.835
- Who's a health care professional.
- Right.

12:48.167 --> 12:50.777
Yeah, look, I really
can't do this right now.

12:51.237 --> 12:53.607
Oh. Is that for you?

12:54.039 --> 12:55.789
Hey, is that your car?
That looks like a... what, a Sorento?

12:56.142 --> 12:57.632
Looks nice. Nice and shiny.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.433
- Who's that waiting for you in the car?
- That's my husband.

12:59.745 --> 13:01.445
- Your husband is 12?
- All right, he's my son.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.301
- He looks annoyed.
- Well, he's 12.

13:04.750 --> 13:06.420
- So there's a husband somewhere.
- Somewhere.

13:06.752 --> 13:09.382
Maybe a drink later?
Which sounds a lot like a date, but it's not.

13:09.855 --> 13:12.165
Later I have to feed my son
and get on him about his homework.

13:12.591 --> 13:14.371
- After that.
- After that, I go to bed.

13:14.727 --> 13:16.217
Breakfast? My treat. Anywhere you want.

13:16.529 --> 13:17.819
Okay.

13:20.299 --> 13:23.959
I'll feed my son and at least get him
pretending to be doing his homework.

13:24.570 --> 13:26.500
You can come by around 8:00.
I'll give you 30 minutes.

13:26.872 --> 13:29.062
8:00. Yeah, 30 minutes.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.145
Pretending to do his homework.

13:37.716 --> 13:41.026
<i>♪ I know what it takes
to make</i> <i>this party jump, so follow me♪</i>

13:41.587 --> 13:45.367
<i>♪ I've seen some stormy skies</i>
<i>but rainy days don't bother me♪</i>

13:48.394 --> 13:50.064
You got a minute for some questions?

13:50.396 --> 13:52.006
Can't. Gotta set up.

13:52.331 --> 13:55.371
Actually, uh, <i>now </i> is what I meant.

13:55.901 --> 13:58.331
I already gave the other guy my statement.

13:58.771 --> 14:00.991
Mixed in with chunks of whatever
you had for dinner last night.

14:01.407 --> 14:04.307
Thought I'd do a little follow-up,
now that you're presumably less hammered.

14:04.810 --> 14:08.380
- I didn't have anything to do with that lady getting killed.
- Well, I don't know that.

14:08.981 --> 14:11.091
Why would I tell you she was out there
if I had something to do with it?

14:11.483 --> 14:13.183
I don't know. You're a moron?

14:13.519 --> 14:15.979
I already know you're not very bright.

14:16.422 --> 14:19.582
It's not murder, but rape
will still get you eight years in prison.

14:20.125 --> 14:21.265
And you brought that to our attention.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.337
Rape? I didn't rape anybody.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.246
The presumption is a 16-year-old
isn't emotionally capable...

14:26.699 --> 14:28.309
of consenting to a sexual encounter.

14:28.634 --> 14:32.414
So legally, the presumption
is a clear "no" across the board.

14:33.038 --> 14:35.498
And having sex with someone
who says no is rape.

14:35.941 --> 14:38.491
Legal age is 16.
She looked it up. Went online or something.

14:38.944 --> 14:41.194
She lied to you about that...

14:41.614 --> 14:44.334
which I'm assuming you believed because it
synced up better with your immediate needs.

14:44.817 --> 14:47.537
Any reason you can think of
why she lied to you about that?

14:48.020 --> 14:49.510
Like maybe it was her first time.

14:49.822 --> 14:52.862
First time? That's hilarious.

14:53.392 --> 14:54.442
She indicated to me that it was.

14:54.693 --> 14:56.423
Maybe she indicated that to you
to mess with you.

14:56.762 --> 14:58.512
What does any of this have to do
with the woman without the head?

14:58.864 --> 15:01.294
What is it with everyone and that question?

15:01.734 --> 15:03.954
It's how a police investigation works.

15:04.370 --> 15:06.070
It's what we do. We ask questions...

15:06.405 --> 15:08.485
sometimes direct, sometimes indirect.

15:08.874 --> 15:10.274
It doesn't matter if
they make sense to you.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.006
Half the time, they don't make sense to me.

15:12.311 --> 15:14.211
Well, I know she's lying about that...

15:14.580 --> 15:16.390
'cause I know for a fact
a guy she did before me.

15:16.749 --> 15:17.769
How do you know he's not lying?

15:18.017 --> 15:21.267
- 'Cause he was my brother.
- "Was."

15:21.820 --> 15:24.430
- What's your brother, dead?
- Yeah, he is dead.

15:24.890 --> 15:27.850
Got clipped on his motorcycle
by a tourist... State Road 301.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.090
Interlake and 301...
they put that light up.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.889
Put the light up right after it happened.

15:33.332 --> 15:35.912
Like some friggin' reminder to me.

15:36.368 --> 15:38.038
'Cause every time I drive by...

15:38.370 --> 15:40.210
I get to remember how he got mangled...

15:40.572 --> 15:43.262
by some Previa-driving ass wipe
from friggin' Maine.

15:45.010 --> 15:46.680
Well, at least you worked through it.

15:47.012 --> 15:48.882
I'm gonna need to ask you
a few more questions...

15:49.248 --> 15:51.358
so, uh, don't leave town
without checking with me first.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.650
- Why?
- Pretty sure we just covered that.

17:14.133 --> 17:16.853
<i>♪ Went
knock-knock-knockin' on every door♪</i>

17:17.336 --> 17:20.116
<i>♪ Till I found you♪</i>

17:20.606 --> 17:21.746
<i>♪ Now that I found you♪</i>

17:22.007 --> 17:26.047
<i>♪ I ain'tgonna let</i>
<i>my eyes off of you♪</i>

17:30.315 --> 17:32.895
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

17:33.352 --> 17:35.022
- What are you drinking?
- Bourbon.

17:35.354 --> 17:37.984
- You don't drink bourbon.
- Sometimes I do.

17:38.457 --> 17:40.507
- Have a seat.
- I'm looking for Carlos.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.883
His wife says he likes to come here
for the old-school pinball.

17:43.262 --> 17:45.282
- Haven't seen him.
- He's right there.

17:46.732 --> 17:49.222
Oh, I didn't even see him.

17:49.668 --> 17:52.418
- Hey, what was the name of that kid's brother?
- What kid?

17:52.905 --> 17:54.685
Uh, Justin. Was it Lane?

17:55.040 --> 17:57.260
Lane? Yeah, maybe. Why?

17:57.676 --> 18:01.656
There's a shrine for him
at the State Road 301 and Interlake.

18:02.314 --> 18:04.484
- When was that accident that killed him?
- Year ago maybe.

18:04.883 --> 18:06.373
- To the day?
- Maybe, about that.

18:06.685 --> 18:08.355
Are you okay?

18:09.655 --> 18:12.995
Yeah. I'm just...

18:13.559 --> 18:14.819
I'm fighting with my wife is all.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.784
- You guys don't fight.
- Not very often.

18:18.263 --> 18:22.043
She ran off to her sister's.
Whatever. Big drama queen. Right?

18:22.668 --> 18:24.308
Hey, have a drink.

18:24.636 --> 18:26.416
Let me take care of this first.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.082
- Sure, sure.
- All right?

18:28.373 --> 18:29.953
I'll be here.

18:33.312 --> 18:35.742
Why didn't you tell me there was a tooth?

18:36.181 --> 18:37.581
What are you talking about?

18:37.883 --> 18:40.573
It says you pulled a tooth from the vic.

18:41.053 --> 18:42.543
A cuspid from the alligator.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.285
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What difference does it make?

18:44.590 --> 18:46.290
Carlos, a tooth can tell us
all kinds of things.

18:46.625 --> 18:47.765
About the alligator.

18:48.026 --> 18:50.276
- Size, sex, migration...
- Of the alligator.

18:50.696 --> 18:53.096
Digestive system... is it fast, slow?
One day? Two days?

18:53.532 --> 18:54.872
- Okay.
- It's been three days.

18:55.167 --> 18:56.067
Maybe the head's still intact.

18:56.301 --> 18:58.791
Are you out of your mind?

18:59.238 --> 19:01.638
How are you gonna find the one alligator...

19:02.074 --> 19:04.594
in a swamp of alligators...
who fed on our Jane Doe?

19:05.043 --> 19:06.773
With the tooth.

19:07.112 --> 19:09.162
No wonder your partner hates you.

19:09.548 --> 19:11.688
- When's the tox screen scheduled?
- Tomorrow.

19:12.084 --> 19:14.514
I wanna come with you.

19:14.953 --> 19:16.943
- I'm not taking you to the lab with me.
- Why not?

19:17.322 --> 19:19.632
The last time I did that, you told them
they had their head up their ass.

19:20.058 --> 19:21.728
They do, or they did.

19:22.060 --> 19:23.790
I have no idea if it's
a recurring problem or not.

19:24.129 --> 19:27.409
- I'll keep an open mind.
- Look...

19:32.271 --> 19:33.561
Hey, baby.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.329
No, no. I'm not playing pinball.

19:37.676 --> 19:40.166
Hey, uh, excuse me.
Where's the guy that was sitting here?

19:40.612 --> 19:42.782
Uh, he said he was tired,
but the beer's for you.

19:48.854 --> 19:51.164
<i>Melanosuchus </i> would be my guess.

19:51.590 --> 19:54.660
Genus, even phylum...
I can't be certain without more research.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.594
But all members of the Chordata family
are territorial.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.760
And digestion is what? Long? Short?

20:00.098 --> 20:01.998
Oh, very slow. Like, 10 days.

20:03.468 --> 20:05.898
Let me hang on to this.
I'll do some blood work.

20:06.338 --> 20:09.208
Probably give you size, sex, coloring.
Will that help?

20:11.143 --> 20:12.813
Call me.

20:17.282 --> 20:19.122
- Real cop.
- Yeah.

20:19.484 --> 20:21.154
Pretty cool. We're working together.

20:21.486 --> 20:22.946
A real case.

20:23.388 --> 20:25.348
J.T. Landers? Never heard of it.

20:25.724 --> 20:28.244
It's a regional clothing chain
operating out of the Southwest.

20:28.694 --> 20:30.424
I'm not big on the fashion
habits of women...

20:30.762 --> 20:32.982
but would you order this thing online?

20:33.398 --> 20:35.508
Uh, depends. Was I exceedingly drunk?

20:35.901 --> 20:37.741
Not the online shopping girl, huh?

20:38.103 --> 20:39.833
Just trying to keep an eye on the budget.

20:40.172 --> 20:41.842
I was under the impression
nurses make good money.

20:42.174 --> 20:44.754
We do. It's medical
school that's killing me.

20:45.210 --> 20:49.220
The victim also had high levels of capsicum
in their stomach from eating spicy foods.

20:49.881 --> 20:51.281
Southwest spicy.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.693
And traces of tricresyl phosphate.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.546
It's a neurotoxin found in motor oil.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.659
People get it from
breathing recycled air...

20:58.991 --> 21:00.541
like on most commercial airline flights.

21:00.859 --> 21:03.199
- You're thinking she's a tourist.
- Tourist. In town on business.

21:03.629 --> 21:05.849
Although I'm trying not to think
anything too specific just yet.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.605
That would explain
why she hasn't been reported missing.

21:09.034 --> 21:11.934
She's traveling alone on business,
family back in Phoenix.

21:12.437 --> 21:15.507
Not to suggest anything too specific.

21:16.041 --> 21:17.821
But is she a mom? Because if she is...

21:18.176 --> 21:19.926
I'm sure one of her kids
is trying to get ahold of her.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.679
See? Thank you.

21:21.980 --> 21:23.560
I said that to my guy.
He told me I was nuts.

21:23.882 --> 21:25.962
Oh. You have a guy.

21:26.351 --> 21:29.721
He's not my own personal guy. I have
to share him with the rest of the county.

21:33.292 --> 21:38.122
So, your captain shot you
for not sleeping with his wife...

21:38.897 --> 21:40.567
and you ended up here.

21:40.899 --> 21:42.189
More or less.

21:42.467 --> 21:45.077
Got a little money for it.
Not a fortune, as it turns out.

21:45.537 --> 21:47.207
But thanks to a rash of short sales...

21:47.539 --> 21:49.029
enough to set myself up
in a decent place...

21:49.341 --> 21:50.831
and not have to look over my shoulder.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.693
But trust me, if it ever gets too busy
or too dangerous, I'm out of here.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.636
Is that more or less?

21:55.947 --> 21:57.907
That was less the parts I'm leaving out
till I get to know you better.

21:58.283 --> 21:59.623
You were fired.

21:59.918 --> 22:01.498
You have a beer or something?

22:01.820 --> 22:03.870
I always have beer, but, frankly...

22:04.256 --> 22:06.626
I don't want my son to think
that there's something going on here.

22:07.059 --> 22:09.019
Can't we just tell him there's nothing
going on while I sip my beer?

22:09.394 --> 22:11.064
Technically, I'm still married...

22:11.396 --> 22:14.796
and Jeff likes to dialogue with his father
about my activities.

22:15.367 --> 22:16.857
Where is he?

22:17.169 --> 22:19.159
He's supposed to be in his bedroom
not doing his homework...

22:19.538 --> 22:21.028
but my guess is he's spying on us.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.000
I meant his father... the guy you're
technically still married to.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.468
Raiford.

22:28.714 --> 22:30.004
Impressive.

22:30.282 --> 22:33.182
Yeah. Jeff!

22:35.153 --> 22:37.263
- Jeff.
- What?

22:37.656 --> 22:40.176
Homework.

22:41.827 --> 22:43.437
- Yeah, I know. I finished.
- All of it?

22:43.762 --> 22:45.602
What part of "finished"
is confusing to you?

22:49.167 --> 22:51.717
So, uh, what you guys talking about?

22:52.170 --> 22:53.540
Like you haven't been listening.

22:53.839 --> 22:55.069
Is that the dead woman you guys found?

22:55.340 --> 22:56.980
No. That's another woman.

22:57.309 --> 22:59.619
Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's the woman we found.

23:00.045 --> 23:02.095
Whoa, cool! What happened to her head?

23:02.481 --> 23:04.561
Okay, this goes bye-bye.

23:04.950 --> 23:07.230
- She offer you a beer?
- No, and I even asked nicely.

23:07.652 --> 23:09.082
- I'll get it.
- No, you won't.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.408
Because he won't be here long enough.

23:11.790 --> 23:14.280
He was just about to get
to the reason why he came and then leave.

23:14.726 --> 23:17.186
- You, go upstairs and do your homework.
- Oh, my gosh! I just told you.

23:17.629 --> 23:21.059
- For real this time.
- Sorry about the beer.

23:27.973 --> 23:30.723
- Armed robbery... my husband.
- I wasn't gonna ask.

23:31.209 --> 23:33.109
Now, is there really something
you want to run by me?

23:33.478 --> 23:35.528
Or can we just say good night?

23:35.914 --> 23:37.844
When did you lose your virginity?

23:38.216 --> 23:40.406
- Okay. Look at the time.
- No, I'm serious.

23:40.819 --> 23:43.839
One of my suspects may have
used her virginity to manipulate a guy.

23:44.356 --> 23:46.756
Now, I've heard rumors about you people.

23:47.192 --> 23:50.592
Is it possible for a girl
to lose her virginity to more than one guy?

23:51.163 --> 23:53.713
Sure. I've lost mine three, four times.

23:54.166 --> 23:57.135
- Really? And we just fall for that?
- Every time.

23:57.135 --> 23:58.035
- Really? And we just fall for that?
- Every time.

23:58.270 --> 24:01.700
What would you say about a girl who lost
her virginity to a couple of brothers?

24:02.274 --> 24:06.844
As in same-parents brothers?
Oh, that chick was good... or desperate.

24:10.882 --> 24:13.192
See? I knew talking to you was a good idea.

24:24.262 --> 24:26.282
Caiman, female.

24:26.665 --> 24:28.655
About four years old.

24:29.034 --> 24:31.204
Between nine and 10 feet.

24:31.603 --> 24:33.303
Not bad from just one tooth.

24:33.638 --> 24:34.778
Got you one better.

24:35.040 --> 24:36.560
Caiman aren't indigenous.

24:36.875 --> 24:39.485
Probably someone's pet
who let it loose when she got too big.

24:39.945 --> 24:41.725
Won't be the only gator in the area...

24:42.080 --> 24:44.950
but she will definitely be the only caiman.

24:45.450 --> 24:48.110
Wait. There we go.

24:50.288 --> 24:52.038
Broad snout.

24:52.390 --> 24:54.030
Boney ridge over the eyes.

24:54.359 --> 24:55.469
Definitely caiman.

24:55.727 --> 24:57.537
Female coloring. Easy 10-footer.

24:59.631 --> 25:01.331
That's the one, right?

25:01.666 --> 25:03.156
Animal's protected.

25:03.468 --> 25:05.458
Well, then how come I
had such a clear shot?

25:14.479 --> 25:16.149
Unorthodox? Try "nuts."

25:16.481 --> 25:18.881
I'm not autopsying an alligator.

25:19.317 --> 25:21.427
- Get that thing off my table.
- Caiman.

25:21.820 --> 25:24.450
- Then let the kid do it.
- Right, and the chain of evidence goes out the window.

25:24.923 --> 25:27.353
- See? You think I'm right.
- I think you're nuts.

25:27.792 --> 25:29.432
But we've been over that already.

25:29.761 --> 25:30.901
Hey, guys.

25:31.162 --> 25:34.092
Tubal absorption runs along
the length of the thorax.

25:34.599 --> 25:36.789
So anything this guy's eaten
over the last 10 days...

25:37.202 --> 25:38.402
will be right along here.

25:38.670 --> 25:40.250
Look at that...
all marked up for you and everything.

25:40.572 --> 25:42.792
Thanks for letting me observe, Dr. Sanchez.
Really appreciate it.

25:43.208 --> 25:44.958
Yeah. No problem.

25:47.879 --> 25:50.309
Uh, <i>Caiman latirostris</i>
is pretty efficient as a predator.

25:50.749 --> 25:52.679
It eats fish, turtles...

25:53.051 --> 25:55.511
small land creatures
like raccoon, possum...

25:55.954 --> 25:57.944
pretty much anything that
ventures into its waters...

25:58.323 --> 25:59.753
especially when it's nesting
or just gave birth.

26:00.058 --> 26:01.668
Their enzyme production is really low...

26:01.993 --> 26:03.513
'cause they have, like, no immune system.

26:03.828 --> 26:05.498
And basically, they never get sick...

26:05.830 --> 26:08.550
so it gets pretty bagged up in there.

26:19.811 --> 26:21.621
Uh, catfish.

26:26.985 --> 26:29.705
I'd say bream or perch maybe.

26:34.526 --> 26:35.896
Oh, box turtle.

26:43.401 --> 26:45.651
- Okay, that's it.
- No, no, no. There's more.

26:47.205 --> 26:49.895
Yeah. I can feel it. Definitely.

27:06.157 --> 27:08.237
Oh, man. Sweet.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.937
A jawbone.

27:20.405 --> 27:22.515
Anything popping with that?

27:22.907 --> 27:24.657
It keeps asking me to update the software.

27:25.010 --> 27:28.170
Ignore it. Most departments work off
Adobe "3.9 years ago" anyway.

27:28.713 --> 27:31.263
Tourists, transients, illegals.
This is Florida.

27:31.716 --> 27:33.146
Thousands of visitors
from all over the world...

27:33.451 --> 27:34.821
pass through here this time of year.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.870
Just focus on the ones
that have been reported missing.

27:37.222 --> 27:38.712
What if they haven't?

27:39.024 --> 27:42.424
Family, coworkers, friends...
someone eventually calls it in.

27:42.994 --> 27:44.894
- Then there's the HIPAA rules.
- Whoa.

27:45.263 --> 27:47.813
We got a lot of legwork to do
before we start asking for dental records.

27:48.266 --> 27:50.316
Pace yourself. It'll come together.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.540
You-You could help.

27:53.905 --> 27:55.015
I found the jawbone.

27:56.908 --> 27:58.658
I saved you a trip to the high school.

27:59.010 --> 28:01.530
Lane Brussard, class of '02. And I quote:

28:01.980 --> 28:03.680
"Okeechobee Southerner's Are Sub-Human."

28:04.015 --> 28:06.325
A quote that's been popping up
all over the high school this past week.

28:06.751 --> 28:08.501
We still don't know what it means.

28:08.853 --> 28:11.373
It means the one-year anniversary
of his brother being killed by a tourist...

28:11.823 --> 28:13.313
had not gone forgotten.

28:21.800 --> 28:24.230
So I figured out who's been painting
on the sides of buildings around here.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.267
- Your brother.
- That's not funny.

28:27.605 --> 28:29.595
Well, I don't mean your brother per se.

28:29.974 --> 28:31.844
I mean someone who loved your brother...

28:32.210 --> 28:34.140
someone who thought he was
a hero worth remembering.

28:34.512 --> 28:36.122
We got a lot of people like that.

28:38.016 --> 28:39.506
Here's what I think is going on...

28:39.818 --> 28:41.518
and you tell me if I've got it wrong.

28:41.853 --> 28:44.253
You hate tourists.
I mean, who doesn't, right?

28:44.689 --> 28:47.649
But unlike us, you have
a really good reason.

28:48.159 --> 28:51.319
And knowing that, I'd be kind of an idiot
not to pursue the possibility...

28:51.863 --> 28:54.523
that you lured one of those
annoying ass wipes into a situation...

28:54.999 --> 28:57.049
killed her, dumped her body in the swamp...

28:57.435 --> 28:59.395
then dragged poor Erin
into it after the fact...

28:59.771 --> 29:02.081
so she could witness you
finding her headless body.

29:02.507 --> 29:04.617
How's that?

29:07.045 --> 29:09.125
Only that's not what happened.

29:09.514 --> 29:11.294
I mean, you might have done it.

29:11.649 --> 29:14.579
I've been wrong before.
But I just don't see it.

29:15.954 --> 29:17.444
See, the thing about murder...

29:17.756 --> 29:19.836
is you really have to be able
to keep it together to get away with it.

29:20.225 --> 29:23.155
And, I don't know,
something about the way a kid like you...

29:23.661 --> 29:25.471
is able to sit here sawing away
at Robbie's chicken-fried steak...

29:25.830 --> 29:27.560
just doesn't say to me
that, three days ago...

29:27.899 --> 29:29.979
you killed a woman
and fed her to an alligator.

29:30.368 --> 29:32.038
Now, what I do see you doing...

29:32.370 --> 29:34.240
is spray-painting "Okeechobee whatever
the hell" on the side of buildings...

29:34.606 --> 29:36.036
so no one would forget your brother.

29:36.341 --> 29:37.651
Will you give me that?

29:40.278 --> 29:42.028
- Okay.
- Good.

29:42.380 --> 29:43.810
Was it your idea or your girlfriend's...

29:44.115 --> 29:45.665
to plaster it all over your high school?

29:45.984 --> 29:47.714
- She's not my girlfriend.
- Not your girlfriend.

29:48.052 --> 29:50.422
- We're just hanging out.
- Hanging out with a 16-year-old?

29:50.855 --> 29:53.985
I mean, it's just...
We were both thinking about him.

29:54.526 --> 29:56.486
I was drunk. I passed out.

29:56.861 --> 29:59.881
I just wanted to remember him.

30:03.268 --> 30:04.758
Sorry, kid.

30:12.310 --> 30:14.970
Yeah, well, he was drunk.
That's not exactly news.

30:15.446 --> 30:18.466
Kid doesn't even remember trying
before passing out completely in the car.

30:18.983 --> 30:20.563
Sure as hell can't account
for Erin's whereabouts.

30:20.885 --> 30:22.995
Yet he can remember tagging
half the damn county.

30:23.388 --> 30:25.258
<i>I got calls in to all
the major airlines...</i>

30:25.623 --> 30:30.373
checking passenger lists on flights
from Flagstaff, Phoenix, Albuquerque.

30:31.129 --> 30:33.379
- I could've done that.
- I said I'd handle it.

30:33.798 --> 30:35.468
The entire school was tagged,
so we should check and see...

30:35.800 --> 30:38.230
<i>if any female teachers or employees</i>
<i>have failed to show up for work.</i>

30:38.670 --> 30:40.780
<i>- Eliminate by profile.</i>
- Oh, we do profiles now?

30:41.172 --> 30:43.222
Approximate height, age, weight.
No children.

30:43.608 --> 30:45.538
This is not my first picnic, Jim.

30:45.910 --> 30:47.460
I still say she'll turn
out to be a tourist.

30:47.779 --> 30:51.089
Uh, bad cop work sticking to one theory,
<i>mi amigo.</i>

30:53.852 --> 30:56.372
- Did you bring your dog to work?
<i>- Had to swing by the house.</i>

30:56.821 --> 30:58.341
Promised the wife I'd look after it.

30:58.656 --> 31:00.236
The last thing I need is to come home...

31:00.558 --> 31:03.658
with the neighbors banging on the door
that the damn thing barked all day.

31:04.195 --> 31:06.685
<i>I'll check with the school,</i>
<i>and then I'll get back to you.</i>

31:07.131 --> 31:08.801
Would you just go?

31:36.828 --> 31:39.788
<i>So, a Blow Pop, two Red Bulls,</i>
<i>corn nuts and lotto ticket.</i>

31:40.298 --> 31:43.698
She buy anything else... beer, whiskey?

31:44.269 --> 31:46.109
- Offer to have sex with you?
- What?

31:46.471 --> 31:48.341
Did she buy anything else?
Maybe came in with someone?

31:48.706 --> 31:50.726
Our A.T.M. was down.
She asked where the nearest one was.

31:51.109 --> 31:52.599
I told her it was across town.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.691
Was her behavior odd
or suspicious in any way?

31:56.247 --> 31:57.857
She seemed pissed off about something...

31:58.182 --> 32:01.222
a little wired
for 2:00 in the morning really.

32:02.754 --> 32:05.154
- You can keep that if you want.
- Really?

32:16.567 --> 32:18.707
A'ight, go.

32:19.103 --> 32:20.533
- Son, I told you.
- What?

32:20.838 --> 32:21.918
I told you already.

32:23.508 --> 32:25.678
<i>♪ She always stay by my side</i>
<i>because she care for me♪</i>

32:26.077 --> 32:27.507
<i>♪ Will you be there for me?♪</i>

32:31.516 --> 32:33.006
<i>Girl bought a lotto ticket?</i>

32:33.318 --> 32:35.368
<i>Blow Pop, two Red Bulls,</i> <i>bag
of corn nuts and lottery tickets.</i>

32:35.753 --> 32:38.333
He was drunk and passed out.
She had to do something.

32:38.790 --> 32:41.220
- Jeff doesn't drink those, does he?
- Yeah, lives on 'em.

32:41.659 --> 32:43.499
- You know what's in that stuff?
- No. Do you?

32:43.861 --> 32:46.231
Oh! Make you pee like a racehorse.

32:46.664 --> 32:48.274
Two of those, she'd be up all night.

32:48.599 --> 32:51.559
Well, I haven't noticed
Jeff doing an inordinate amount of peeing.

32:52.070 --> 32:54.790
- Am I bothering you?
- Yes. I'm busy.

32:55.273 --> 32:57.993
Don't take it personally.
I have a test on Monday.

32:58.476 --> 33:00.726
I don't know... 16-year-old female killer?

33:01.145 --> 33:02.955
Statistical long shot.

33:03.314 --> 33:06.064
But she did lie about leaving.
Maybe even lied to Justin.

33:06.551 --> 33:08.011
I still don't understand
why you guys do that.

33:08.319 --> 33:09.989
Because we can.

33:10.321 --> 33:12.281
It's special, or at least
you guys think it is.

33:12.657 --> 33:15.587
- You don't think it's special?
- I did at the time.

33:16.094 --> 33:19.344
I saw Jeff hanging with some older boys.

33:19.897 --> 33:21.447
I know his friends. They're okay.

33:21.766 --> 33:24.046
- Or maybe... Was he smoking?
- Nope.

33:24.469 --> 33:27.809
You wouldn't tell me if he was.

33:28.373 --> 33:30.683
You can't talk Jeff into doing something
he doesn't wanna do.

33:31.109 --> 33:33.359
If he's into something wrong,
he got there by himself.

33:33.778 --> 33:35.268
It's the best you can hope for.

33:35.580 --> 33:38.130
- You have to read that whole book?
- Eventually.

33:38.583 --> 33:40.833
Maybe I'll take Jeff to a movie.

33:42.653 --> 33:45.143
You barely have enough time for yourself.
I'm sure he's bored.

33:45.590 --> 33:47.260
Look, don't police my son.

33:47.592 --> 33:50.462
Neither one of us are huge fans
of your line of work.

33:50.962 --> 33:53.042
Yes, I understand that.

33:56.267 --> 33:57.437
Mike.

33:57.702 --> 33:59.372
The high school hasn't reported...

33:59.704 --> 34:01.484
any of their regular female teachers
missing, however...

34:01.839 --> 34:03.099
She doesn't have to be a regular employee.

34:03.374 --> 34:05.924
Damn it, Jim! Would you just for once
let me finish my thought?

34:06.377 --> 34:07.547
Sorry.

34:09.414 --> 34:11.024
There was a substitute teacher
who was scheduled to teach last week...

34:11.349 --> 34:13.099
who never showed up
and hasn't been heard from since.

34:13.451 --> 34:14.591
Did the substitute teacher have a name?

34:14.851 --> 34:17.782
Yes. Salazar. Gina Salazar.

34:19.190 --> 34:20.739
Huh.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.349
Jim?

34:23.860 --> 34:25.201
Jim?

34:27.831 --> 34:29.322
I hate you, too, you little shit.

34:45.315 --> 34:46.806
Sucks...

34:49.487 --> 34:51.036
letting someone go.

35:02.700 --> 35:03.550
Thanks.

35:03.768 --> 35:05.498
Just not in the car.

35:30.328 --> 35:33.428
The night he was killed,
he was coming to see me.

35:35.600 --> 35:38.290
Lane. He'd just gotten
off work at Pizza Hut...

35:38.769 --> 35:40.759
and I told him to meet me here.

35:41.139 --> 35:44.009
I told him to wear his Calvin Klein...

35:44.509 --> 35:47.169
'cause I didn't want him
smelling like Pizza Hut my first time.

35:49.280 --> 35:51.210
I was so nervous.

35:51.582 --> 35:53.252
Maybe he was too. I don't know.

35:53.584 --> 35:55.364
Maybe his mind was just elsewhere.

36:03.227 --> 36:05.097
I never told Justin this, but...

36:07.331 --> 36:09.961
he and Lane look really alike.

36:11.702 --> 36:14.252
I mean, not in the face or anything.

36:15.773 --> 36:18.383
But like, you know, their hands...

36:19.877 --> 36:21.367
their voice.

36:22.980 --> 36:24.880
It's so weird on the phone.

36:26.951 --> 36:29.791
I thought that with Calvin Klein
and everything...

36:30.288 --> 36:32.068
it might seem like it was him.

36:34.825 --> 36:38.195
Like if Lane hadn't been killed
on his motorcycle that night...

36:39.664 --> 36:41.564
and we finally got to do it.

36:44.835 --> 36:46.645
I really wanted it to be him.

36:47.004 --> 36:48.494
He was a surrogate.

36:50.308 --> 36:52.038
You used Justin in place of his brother.

36:54.011 --> 36:56.121
He didn't like that... subbing
for his brother?

36:56.514 --> 36:59.794
Threw a brand-new bottle
of C.K. in the creek.

37:00.351 --> 37:03.041
- Is that why you left?
- Partly.

37:03.521 --> 37:05.251
He was too drunk by then anyway.

37:05.590 --> 37:07.080
Tried for, like, 15 minutes.

37:09.694 --> 37:12.274
You'd think he'd stop drinking.

37:12.730 --> 37:15.420
But I think trying made him drink more.

37:15.900 --> 37:18.800
So after he passed out, I just left.

37:19.303 --> 37:20.563
Tried to stay gone a long time.

37:20.838 --> 37:22.678
Went and got my daddy his lotto scratchers.

37:24.141 --> 37:26.221
I was mad, I guess. I don't know.

37:26.611 --> 37:28.861
Wanted Justin to worry about me.

37:29.280 --> 37:30.950
How long were you gone?

37:32.483 --> 37:34.733
- I don't know, hour maybe.
- So you left twice.

37:36.687 --> 37:39.237
And you were gone a lot
longer than an hour.

37:39.690 --> 37:41.650
You got here just after
2:00 in the morning...

37:42.026 --> 37:44.776
then used an A.T.M. at the bank in the
strip mall at the other side of town.

37:46.764 --> 37:48.724
I went twice.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.440
I told you I was trying
to make Justin worry about me.

37:54.238 --> 37:56.228
You remember a Gina Salazar?

37:56.607 --> 37:58.797
She sometimes
substitute-teaches at your school.

38:00.378 --> 38:01.368
No.

38:01.612 --> 38:03.542
Yeah. She served you
with detention for writing...

38:03.914 --> 38:06.194
"Okeechobee Southerners are sub-human"
on your assignment.

38:06.617 --> 38:08.367
Okay.

38:08.719 --> 38:10.269
She's missing.

38:32.843 --> 38:35.533
I guess that's better than Pizza Hut.

38:36.013 --> 38:39.323
- Hey! I think I got one!
- I'm impressed.

38:39.884 --> 38:41.934
I was told there weren't
any fish in this creek.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.990
Got lucky, I guess.

38:46.590 --> 38:49.340
- What kind of fish is that?
- Looks like a shiner.

38:49.827 --> 38:52.017
I thought you said fishing was gay.

38:52.430 --> 38:54.210
Hey, aren't I contaminating a crime scene?

38:54.565 --> 38:56.705
You're helping me interview witnesses.

38:59.970 --> 39:01.370
Doesn't look like he saw much.

39:01.672 --> 39:04.132
Thank him for his time,
send him on his way.

39:10.781 --> 39:12.121
<i>So the teacher's not missing?</i>

39:12.416 --> 39:13.966
She ran off with some guy.

39:14.285 --> 39:15.715
Husband was pissed I even called.

39:16.020 --> 39:17.830
Told me to shove his wife's
dental records up my ass.

39:18.189 --> 39:20.939
- Girl still lied.
- Yeah.

39:21.425 --> 39:23.155
Sometimes they do that.

39:25.196 --> 39:26.716
Hey, I appreciate
your keeping our streak alive.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.371
Just burgers.

39:28.666 --> 39:30.336
Under the circumstances,
I would've understood.

39:30.668 --> 39:32.748
I know I've been treating you
like my secretary.

39:35.139 --> 39:38.099
Well, we got the jawbone. I'll stay on it.

39:40.745 --> 39:42.415
You know, you might feel a bit better...

39:42.747 --> 39:44.477
if you get out whatever it is
that's bothering you.

39:48.252 --> 39:51.212
I mean, look, I never intended
on playing this card, but...

39:51.722 --> 39:53.422
We're partners,
but technically, with seniority...

39:53.758 --> 39:55.658
I'm your supervisor, your boss.

39:56.026 --> 39:57.516
I guess I know that.

39:57.828 --> 40:00.288
I've given you a lot of latitude,
too much maybe.

40:00.731 --> 40:03.691
But how else was I supposed
to evaluate your worthiness?

40:04.201 --> 40:05.661
I mean, hell, you won't even
wear the uniform.

40:05.970 --> 40:09.190
I wear the badge, you know, in spirit.

40:11.308 --> 40:12.888
I've been doing a good job here
for a long time.

40:13.210 --> 40:16.310
- I'm just trying to work in.
- Well, I'm having trouble with that.

40:16.847 --> 40:19.627
You being here, I mean
it's not really fair to either one of us.

40:20.117 --> 40:21.897
Why should I feel like
I'm not up to the job?

40:22.253 --> 40:25.003
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to tell you that this isn't working out.

40:25.489 --> 40:27.509
No, I mean the meat.
You're smashing the burgers. Dries 'em out.

40:31.996 --> 40:35.336
Look, I appreciate
you telling me how you feel.

40:36.801 --> 40:38.291
I know you and Janice are fighting.

40:38.602 --> 40:40.092
I know that's hard for you.

40:41.572 --> 40:43.242
You can't really expect me to be sloppy...

40:43.574 --> 40:45.124
just so you feel better about yourself.

40:49.914 --> 40:51.404
The burgers are done.

40:53.083 --> 40:55.453
- When's Janice coming home?
- She didn't say.

40:55.886 --> 40:57.556
She didn't say?

40:58.889 --> 41:00.669
She must really be mad at you.

41:04.895 --> 41:06.565
I need to chop an onion.

41:28.385 --> 41:30.225
Better get to these quick.

41:30.588 --> 41:33.018
Do you even carry your service revolver?

41:33.457 --> 41:35.567
I checked your vehicle. It wasn't there.

41:35.960 --> 41:38.480
It's Sunday, Mike.
What do I need a gun for?

41:38.929 --> 41:41.419
You pulled my wife's dental records...

41:41.866 --> 41:43.356
without telling me.

41:43.667 --> 41:46.157
What kind of cop looks into his partner
without telling him?

41:47.638 --> 41:49.828
Your wife was missing.

41:50.241 --> 41:52.901
- Well, that and your shoes.
- My shoes?

41:53.377 --> 41:55.567
Which were all over the crime scene.

41:55.980 --> 41:57.380
To say nothing of the M.E.'s report...

41:57.681 --> 41:59.491
which confirmed
the victim's natural Florida tan...

41:59.850 --> 42:01.250
and the fact she'd never had children.

42:01.552 --> 42:03.392
Probably settling for a dog,
which you hate...

42:03.754 --> 42:05.454
but cared for so the neighbors
wouldn't get suspicious.

42:05.789 --> 42:07.979
- Jim...
- Then, of course, there's the capsicum in her stomach...

42:08.392 --> 42:10.442
 - evidence that
she'd recently eaten Southwestern spicy food.

42:10.828 --> 42:12.498
And the fact that just hours
before she was killed...

42:12.830 --> 42:15.640
she was on a commercial flight wearing a
blouse she bought while visiting her sister.

42:16.133 --> 42:19.123
- Okay, Jim. - To be perfectly honest,
amigo, when you really think about it...

42:19.637 --> 42:22.187
- you were so incredibly bad at this.
- I said okay!

42:22.640 --> 42:24.420
I feel kind of stupid
that it took me so long.

42:28.512 --> 42:32.172
Your wife didn't go to her sister's
because you had a fight, Mike.

42:32.783 --> 42:35.153
She was flying back to tell you
she was gonna leave you.

42:35.586 --> 42:38.686
And... you had a fight.

42:41.058 --> 42:43.228
So, what are we gonna do?

42:44.862 --> 42:46.882
I killed my wife...

42:47.264 --> 42:49.924
mutilated the woman
I slept next to for 16 years.

42:50.401 --> 42:52.591
- You think I won't shoot you?
- Kind of hoping you won't.

42:53.003 --> 42:55.633
I mean, look at you. You act like a clown.

42:56.106 --> 42:58.766
- You treat the job like an inconvenience.
- It is kind of a pain in the ass.

42:59.243 --> 43:01.353
Why should I take shit from you?

43:03.547 --> 43:05.097
'Cause I'm a better cop than you.

43:09.520 --> 43:11.360
I tried.

43:11.722 --> 43:13.392
Jim, I really tried.

43:13.724 --> 43:16.534
I mean, things didn't
always suck between us.

43:17.027 --> 43:18.367
That wasn't my intention.

43:18.662 --> 43:21.122
I'm talking about me and Janice.

43:21.565 --> 43:23.345
Oh. Sorry.

43:23.701 --> 43:25.871
Um, what happened?

43:26.270 --> 43:28.410
Everything happened.

43:28.806 --> 43:30.886
I lost my confidence, the...

43:31.275 --> 43:33.175
I lost the one good thing
I had here at home.

43:34.812 --> 43:38.122
Sick and tired of hearing me
bitch about you all the time.

43:40.117 --> 43:41.407
I don't know.

43:41.685 --> 43:44.725
If we'd had kids, maybe...

43:45.255 --> 43:48.795
But it just got so bad.
I didn't know where I wanted to be.

43:49.393 --> 43:52.053
I didn't want to be at home.
I didn't want to be at work.

43:53.897 --> 43:56.297
Did you ever not want to be anywhere?

43:56.734 --> 43:59.664
Here. I hate it here.

44:01.071 --> 44:03.411
But the golf is great.

44:03.841 --> 44:06.271
And I might have met someone.

44:06.710 --> 44:09.640
She has a kid and is married to a guy
in prison, but we'll see how it goes.

44:16.987 --> 44:18.507
Can you give me an hour?

44:18.822 --> 44:20.432
How's that again?

44:20.758 --> 44:23.008
So I don't have to shoot you.

44:23.427 --> 44:26.007
You wouldn't get very far.

44:35.673 --> 44:37.043
Hands up. Give me the gun.

44:40.477 --> 44:41.967
Got it.

44:49.653 --> 44:51.403
Let's go.

45:00.731 --> 45:02.071
Did he say why?

45:02.366 --> 45:04.446
Not really. He blamed me.

45:05.736 --> 45:07.026
I can see that.

45:07.304 --> 45:09.764
Right. I'm so hard to work with,
a man killed his wife.

45:11.041 --> 45:12.331
You are.

45:17.948 --> 45:21.228
See that? Over your rudeness,
and I still punch it up there.

45:24.455 --> 45:25.305
Damn it!

45:26.457 --> 45:27.567
There you go.

45:34.364 --> 45:35.654
Ouch.

45:42.206 --> 45:44.346
If I make this and break 80...

45:44.742 --> 45:46.412
you're not gonna kill your wife, are you?

45:46.744 --> 45:49.204
And give you the satisfaction
of arresting me?

45:49.646 --> 45:50.936
No way.

45:56.954 --> 45:57.804
Yeah, baby!

45:58.021 --> 46:00.891
You're kidding me.

46:01.391 --> 46:03.441
I miss, you're happy.

46:03.827 --> 46:05.527
- You're an asshole.
- Why am I an asshole?

46:05.863 --> 46:08.173
Well, I wouldn't be, like,
"Yeah, baby! Conka-chunka!"...

46:08.599 --> 46:10.909
if you blew your chance to break 80.

46:11.335 --> 46:13.885
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

46:14.338 --> 46:17.028
- You're not gonna give me that?
- That's four feet.

46:17.508 --> 46:19.028
You're not gonna give me that for 80?

46:19.343 --> 46:21.013
Not four feet.

46:21.345 --> 46:23.455
Oh. Are you an asshole now?

46:25.415 --> 46:26.905
Okay.

46:32.723 --> 46:33.773
<i>An 81.</i>

46:34.024 --> 46:35.864
You three-putted the last hole.

46:36.226 --> 46:37.716
Burned the edge on the outside.

46:38.028 --> 46:40.218
Went five feet past. He gave me that one.

46:40.631 --> 46:42.411
A gimme 81. Wow.

46:42.766 --> 46:44.876
Hey, I feel good about it.
My game's in good shape.

46:45.269 --> 46:46.969
I left a couple of shots out there,
but that's golf.

46:47.304 --> 46:48.764
Oh, you watch way too much Golf Channel.

46:49.072 --> 46:51.322
- I do. I really do.
- Yeah.

46:55.879 --> 46:58.869
- Thanks for taking Jeff fishing.
- Sure.

46:59.383 --> 47:01.493
His dad never did anything like that.

47:01.885 --> 47:05.015
Well, he was trying to put
a roof over his family's head...

47:05.556 --> 47:07.306
you know, by stealing things
that didn't belong to him.

47:09.326 --> 47:12.166
I'm not making excuses.
I knew what he was doing.

47:12.663 --> 47:15.093
I didn't like it and I told him so...

47:15.532 --> 47:17.022
but I knew what he was doing.

47:17.334 --> 47:19.614
- Should've left him.
- I could've.

47:20.037 --> 47:21.877
But I didn't.

47:22.239 --> 47:23.909
And then I didn't have to.

47:24.241 --> 47:27.461
Well, you wouldn't be the first woman
in history to divorce a man in prison.

47:28.011 --> 47:32.701
Yeah, but then I'd be the woman
who divorced her husband in prison.

47:36.253 --> 47:37.863
What?

47:38.188 --> 47:40.378
- What?
- You're staring, and I don't...

47:40.791 --> 47:42.571
Oh. No, no. Nothing.

47:42.926 --> 47:45.506
Uh, just admiring the view.
