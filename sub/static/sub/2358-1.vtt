A KIM HAN-MIN FILM

01:08.236 --> 01:11.072
1597, Second Japanese Invasion

01:17.370 --> 01:20.039
<i>Accused by a Japanese double agent,</i>

01:20.039 --> 01:25.962
<i>Admiral Yi Sun-shin is relieved
of command and tortured.</i>

01:31.634 --> 01:35.471
<i>In July, Joseon's navy is
decimated in Chilcheollyang.</i>

01:35.680 --> 01:40.560
<i>Japan's army advances mercilessly,</i>

01:40.560 --> 01:45.106
<i>capturing two crucial regions in August,</i>

01:45.106 --> 01:50.445
<i>and setting its sights on the capital.</i>

01:50.445 --> 01:57.910
<i>King Seonjo quickly pardons and reinstates Yi,</i>

01:57.910 --> 02:02.915
<i>who immediately rallies his
remaining warships and troops.</i>

02:02.915 --> 02:09.380
<i>He obtains 12 ships that escaped
the battle of Chilcheollyang,</i>

02:09.380 --> 02:13.092
<i>and encamps on the Southern</i> Sea.

02:13.092 --> 02:18.306
<i>Just 20km away in Haenam,
Japan's navy sets up base,</i>

02:18.306 --> 02:24.645
<i>preparing to attack with over 300 ships.</i>

02:53.341 --> 02:54.967
So, Admiral,

02:56.511 --> 02:58.971
when will you join them?

03:01.224 --> 03:02.558
What do you mean?

03:05.102 --> 03:07.897
As per royal order, of course.

03:07.897 --> 03:12.068
Your orders are to join
forces with ground troops

03:13.820 --> 03:18.032
under General Gwon Yul.

03:19.784 --> 03:22.161
Is that what it says?

03:23.162 --> 03:24.038
What?

03:28.709 --> 03:30.253
With all due respect,

03:31.420 --> 03:34.173
the enemy has over 200 ships!

03:34.590 --> 03:37.635
Our men are deserting their posts!

03:37.635 --> 03:41.973
The number of deserters has reached...

03:42.849 --> 03:44.350
50...

03:44.809 --> 03:47.770
I must ease my mind.

03:48.396 --> 03:52.525
200 enemy ships could
invade at any moment!

03:53.192 --> 03:54.819
What strategy...

03:56.821 --> 04:02.451
have you in mind to repel them?

04:05.079 --> 04:08.374
Let's hear from the young officers!

04:08.374 --> 04:09.876
Do we stand a chance?

04:13.087 --> 04:13.838
Do we?

04:18.801 --> 04:21.428
Don't save your breath!

04:23.180 --> 04:24.473
Admiral.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.727
Please help us erase all doubt.

04:27.977 --> 04:31.981
Aside from a damaged turtle ship,
what plan is in place?

04:31.981 --> 04:34.525
You're addressing our commander!

04:35.276 --> 04:36.736
How dare you!

04:36.736 --> 04:38.946
I'm your ranking officer!

04:38.946 --> 04:40.489
Shut your mouth and listen!

04:40.489 --> 04:42.158
You have no right!

04:42.158 --> 04:45.453
You're merely a deserter
who fled from Chilcheollyang!

04:58.966 --> 05:02.762
Boy, we possess those 12 ships,

05:02.762 --> 05:05.848
because I got out from
that doomed battle.

05:05.848 --> 05:09.101
Know when to open your mouth.

05:10.061 --> 05:14.732
Admiral, you know as well as
anyone that this battle is futile.

05:15.066 --> 05:20.613
I saw firsthand the brutality
and strength of our foes!

05:21.072 --> 05:23.157
10,000 men were lost!

05:23.699 --> 05:28.079
Will you knowingly send
the rest of our men to their graves?

05:36.963 --> 05:39.131
This briefing is adjourned.

05:39.465 --> 05:40.800
Dismissed.

05:41.133 --> 05:42.259
Admiral!

05:42.259 --> 05:44.178
He gave an order!

05:50.059 --> 05:51.811
Everyone out.

05:52.603 --> 05:56.023
Our priority is to repair
the ships and train our men!

05:57.775 --> 05:58.609
Now!

06:50.411 --> 06:55.624
We must capture King Seonjo
and end this war.

06:55.624 --> 07:00.379
He mustn't slip through
our fingers like before.

07:00.755 --> 07:04.550
We must coordinate,
like a perfect storm!

07:04.550 --> 07:05.509
Prepare at once!

07:05.509 --> 07:06.677
Yes, commander.

07:06.969 --> 07:13.059
We can't allow Konishi
to dethrone Joseon first.

07:13.059 --> 07:19.273
But Chancellor Hideyoshi
wants us to wait for his man.

07:19.857 --> 07:23.861
So we have no choice.

07:30.326 --> 07:32.536
Aren't those Wakizaka's ships?

07:32.536 --> 07:36.957
Yes, back from reconnaissance.

07:37.666 --> 07:40.836
How many trips?

07:40.836 --> 07:43.923
Three, including last night's.

07:48.219 --> 07:49.595
But sir,

07:50.179 --> 07:55.518
who is the chancellor sending us?

07:57.311 --> 08:01.440
Someone essential
to this battle, I'm told.

08:01.982 --> 08:08.697
One who can overpower Yi Sun-shin.

08:09.907 --> 08:13.410
General

08:22.419 --> 08:30.010
It is futile to battle such a formidable foe.
I command you to disband
the navy and join Gwon Yul's army.

09:08.799 --> 09:10.217
Father! Father!

09:10.217 --> 09:12.970
Captain Bae tried,
but they're gonna kill him!

09:12.970 --> 09:14.805
He had to!

09:15.139 --> 09:16.640
We'll die anyway!

09:20.352 --> 09:23.022
Father! Father!

09:31.488 --> 09:33.824
I will...

09:35.159 --> 09:38.829
have your head!

10:52.820 --> 10:54.822
Forgive me for interfering.

10:55.281 --> 10:58.367
I couldn't simply pass by.

10:59.201 --> 11:04.081
Are you the one sent by the chancellor?

11:34.111 --> 11:36.739
It's the navy from Ehime Prefecture.

11:37.072 --> 11:38.490
They're not navy.

11:38.741 --> 11:40.659
Pirates, more like.

11:43.037 --> 11:44.288
Let's move.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.510
Deployment imminent

12:00.429 --> 12:02.598
It's swarming with activity.

12:02.890 --> 12:05.309
Over 200 warships are docked,

12:05.309 --> 12:07.519
supply ships are being loaded,

12:07.853 --> 12:11.523
and they're stealing
provisions from villagers.

12:11.815 --> 12:14.735
They cut off the nose
of any who resist,

12:15.152 --> 12:17.738
and use children for target practice.

12:21.492 --> 12:24.578
It seems as if...

12:25.120 --> 12:27.581
they're on the verge of deployment.

12:32.503 --> 12:34.671
Is it true that

12:35.714 --> 12:38.759
25,000 Japanese reinforcement
soldiers are en route?

12:39.635 --> 12:41.929
Yes, it appears so.

12:42.096 --> 12:45.265
They act like our navy does not exist,

12:45.265 --> 12:50.187
and talk of swarming the capital,
like it was nothing at all.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.607
We must do something,

12:55.651 --> 12:57.778
or the capital will run with blood.

13:04.159 --> 13:07.913
Deliver this to Junsa and
return with his report.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.581
At once, sir.

13:14.670 --> 13:17.589
The figurehead is complete!

13:18.090 --> 13:21.009
The figurehead is complete!

13:21.385 --> 13:24.930
Turtle ship's figurehead!

13:36.567 --> 13:37.818
Sweetheart.

13:41.572 --> 13:43.198
Another talisman?

13:44.700 --> 13:47.578
This isn't my first mission.

13:48.871 --> 13:50.497
But I'll treasure it.

13:50.873 --> 13:52.249
I'm off.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.387
Take care of yourself!

14:41.548 --> 14:45.010
Is Yi disobeying
the royal order again?

14:45.302 --> 14:47.679
He pursues what he feels
is a logical path.

14:47.679 --> 14:51.725
If he disobeys the royal order,
I cannot guarantee his safety.

14:51.725 --> 14:54.269
The southern provinces have fallen.

14:54.436 --> 14:56.813
Japan's ground
forces are northbound.

14:56.813 --> 15:01.276
If their navy should also reach
the capital via the southern sea,

15:01.276 --> 15:02.444
what would happen?

15:02.611 --> 15:05.364
But what can he do
with a measly 12 ships?!

15:05.364 --> 15:09.117
How can 12 measly ships
reinforce the army?

15:10.452 --> 15:11.787
Don't mince words!

15:12.079 --> 15:14.206
I know he's not even in good health!

15:14.206 --> 15:17.251
And who's responsible for that?

15:18.544 --> 15:20.128
You son of a...

15:20.462 --> 15:23.632
Do you even know the situation here?

15:24.049 --> 15:27.928
The infamous Kiyomasa is
knocking at our gate.

15:28.220 --> 15:33.517
Ergo! We need every
able body still standing!

15:34.685 --> 15:35.394
Grab him!

15:36.019 --> 15:36.770
Grab him!

15:36.770 --> 15:37.437
Let go!

15:38.021 --> 15:39.064
Let go!

15:47.364 --> 15:50.909
Please general,
grant us men and weapons.

15:51.535 --> 15:54.871
The navy is facing a Goliath!

15:55.789 --> 15:57.499
So obey the royal order.

15:58.041 --> 16:03.171
Will you ignore the admiral's
earnest request?

16:03.714 --> 16:05.841
How dare you!

16:06.174 --> 16:07.718
You are out of line!

16:08.302 --> 16:10.178
What are you all waiting for?

16:10.178 --> 16:12.055
Take him away and
lock him up this instant!

16:12.055 --> 16:13.557
General!

16:14.016 --> 16:15.142
General!

16:16.602 --> 16:17.894
Please!

16:17.894 --> 16:21.315
The admiral wishes
to convey these words!

16:21.315 --> 16:25.360
"To forfeit the sea is to forfeit Joseon!"

16:25.694 --> 16:29.072
General! General!

16:38.790 --> 16:40.959
I've waited half a day.

16:41.335 --> 16:45.172
Is this how you treat your guest?

16:53.555 --> 16:56.391
We were too focused on
the war briefing

16:56.391 --> 16:58.894
to give attention to our guest.

16:59.269 --> 17:00.687
I beg your forgiveness.

17:02.773 --> 17:07.944
By the way, how do pirates

17:08.319 --> 17:10.238
usually kill a king?

17:12.281 --> 17:14.159
Please enlighten us.

17:23.126 --> 17:26.588
I've surveyed the region.

17:26.588 --> 17:31.009
If we ride the morning
tide in the strait,

17:31.009 --> 17:33.595
we can resupply the troops by night,

17:33.595 --> 17:36.223
and sail into the capital.

17:36.223 --> 17:40.602
We'll be there in a day and a half.

17:51.154 --> 17:53.448
Easier said than done.

17:54.199 --> 17:57.202
Yi Sun-shin is not a feeble adversary.

17:59.496 --> 18:02.082
Sailing the open sea,

18:03.125 --> 18:05.001
and approaching the capital

18:05.001 --> 18:09.756
to annihilate Yi with
the army is the best strategy.

18:09.756 --> 18:16.638
Why do you think
Hideyoshi sent me, Wakizaka?

18:20.892 --> 18:24.312
How dare you utter his name!

18:46.543 --> 18:50.964
I will crush Yi with this hand.

18:54.384 --> 18:59.598
Will you allow Konishi
to walk into the capital first?

19:08.231 --> 19:11.359
I've committed a grave mistake.

19:11.818 --> 19:16.198
Please forgive my men.

19:16.573 --> 19:21.495
Sit with me, Kurushima.

19:37.719 --> 19:41.598
One swing of this sword, blood will spread

19:51.858 --> 19:53.318
Mother...

20:04.830 --> 20:06.832
Father, it's Hoe.

20:19.845 --> 20:21.513
It's nice to be with you.

20:23.849 --> 20:24.724
Yes, sir.

20:28.770 --> 20:29.729
Father.

20:31.356 --> 20:32.983
Speak freely.

20:34.484 --> 20:37.112
Perhaps this is a blessing in disguise.

20:37.112 --> 20:40.740
Why not blame ailing
health and return home?

20:41.700 --> 20:44.703
We haven't held a proper
funeral for grandmother.

20:44.703 --> 20:47.372
Only a temporary shrine.

20:49.374 --> 20:51.293
Allow our men to join the army,

20:53.044 --> 20:55.922
and say you can no longer
fulfill your duties.

21:00.594 --> 21:03.471
I feel your resentment
towards our king.

21:04.222 --> 21:06.933
The king tried to take your life.

21:08.852 --> 21:11.438
How could you not feel resentment?

21:12.022 --> 21:13.064
Father.

21:14.149 --> 21:16.401
Our fleet is but 12 ships.

21:17.110 --> 21:19.946
It is shameful to call
ourselves a navy.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.239
Even if...

21:22.032 --> 21:25.327
you somehow lead
these men to victory,

21:26.036 --> 21:28.371
the king will surely abandon you.

21:30.749 --> 21:32.667
What are you fighting for?

21:34.461 --> 21:35.462
For loyalty.

21:35.462 --> 21:36.630
To that...

21:38.590 --> 21:40.258
...impudent king?

21:40.425 --> 21:41.927
It is said,

21:44.304 --> 21:48.350
a commander's loyalty
must lie with the king,

21:49.809 --> 21:54.648
and the king must follow his subjects.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.108
Not himself?

21:57.359 --> 22:00.028
The people build a nation.

22:00.528 --> 22:02.697
Only then can a king exist.

22:02.697 --> 22:04.240
Even if...

22:06.409 --> 22:11.748
those people care about nothing
more than their own lives?

22:16.795 --> 22:20.298
Eat your meal, it's precious food.

22:29.349 --> 22:30.767
Make way!

22:35.814 --> 22:36.481
Admiral.

22:43.905 --> 22:46.866
Stay away to avoid beheading

22:48.159 --> 22:50.078
Look... look at this...

22:50.662 --> 22:53.748
That's Captain Bae Hong-suk!

22:54.666 --> 22:56.668
He led the flagship!

23:20.650 --> 23:22.819
Do not enter

23:38.209 --> 23:39.252
Get them out of here!

23:39.252 --> 23:40.336
Get them out!

23:40.962 --> 23:42.130
Get out from there!

23:42.130 --> 23:43.298
Now!

23:48.470 --> 23:51.347
June 7th
Kurushima Michifusa
25 years

23:57.020 --> 24:01.441
Did you behead the prisoners
and send them back?

24:04.152 --> 24:07.822
After cutting off their noses and ears.

24:08.448 --> 24:12.452
Have you a death wish?

24:16.873 --> 24:21.628
Why provoke the enemy
with this senseless act?

24:22.712 --> 24:27.759
Why not? It'll be an interesting fight.

24:28.259 --> 24:29.803
But...

24:30.929 --> 24:34.182
will they fight?

24:34.390 --> 24:38.228
Yi Sun-shin is not a foe to take lightly!

24:38.520 --> 24:46.736
1 hear some of your men
revere Yi's prowess.

24:46.945 --> 24:50.532
Perhaps the defeat in Hansan

24:52.325 --> 24:54.327
has shriveled your balls?

24:55.745 --> 24:56.996
How dare you?

25:19.936 --> 25:22.188
Let me be clear.

25:22.730 --> 25:25.942
Why do you think
the chancellor sent me?

25:26.943 --> 25:31.114
It's because of men like you
who tremble at Yi's name.

25:33.449 --> 25:36.077
Don't draw your sword so recklessly.

25:36.452 --> 25:39.998
Your head may be the first to fall.

25:57.974 --> 26:02.854
My brother Michiyuki became
minion to the chancellor,

26:03.229 --> 26:08.067
and died on his quest
to conquer Joseon.

26:08.610 --> 26:14.574
With me facing the chancellor's wrath,
he joined this war to save me,

26:14.574 --> 26:18.453
and died by 'H's hand.

26:19.245 --> 26:25.043
The chancellor is ill,
he has a year at most.

26:25.418 --> 26:29.547
That's why he's rushing this campaign.

26:32.258 --> 26:36.304
Joseon, which he so desires,

26:37.430 --> 26:39.682
will fall to me.

26:43.061 --> 26:48.566
That is why Yi must perish.

26:50.610 --> 26:52.320
Do you understand, Haru?

26:55.865 --> 26:58.868
Perhaps this will also be

27:01.246 --> 27:03.790
proper revenge for my brother.

27:11.464 --> 27:13.132
Why did he do it?

27:13.800 --> 27:15.260
Isn't that Oh Sang-go?

27:16.552 --> 27:18.763
He got caught trying to flee!

27:19.681 --> 27:22.100
It is! It's Sang-go!

27:34.279 --> 27:37.490
He was captured near
Blood Isle while fleeing.

27:43.162 --> 27:49.210
My comrades of 6 years
all died in Chilcheollyang.

27:51.004 --> 27:55.258
Today I buried them
with my own hands...

27:55.591 --> 27:58.261
I couldn't help myself.

27:59.470 --> 28:02.473
Now, my turn will come.

28:04.142 --> 28:06.561
Must all of us...

28:07.353 --> 28:10.231
die in vain?

28:15.862 --> 28:18.114
Are you finished?

28:47.518 --> 28:49.187
Discipline stands!

28:50.313 --> 28:52.106
In any situation!

28:54.108 --> 28:55.818
Is that clear?

29:19.550 --> 29:22.970
There's no way out now.

29:23.388 --> 29:25.932
He'll kill even his own.

29:26.349 --> 29:28.142
There is...

29:30.144 --> 29:32.188
always a way.

30:17.733 --> 30:20.027
As the bottleneck of the strait,

30:20.027 --> 30:22.238
the current is very strong here.

30:22.238 --> 30:26.617
They say it is so treacherous,
nothing can escape.

30:28.161 --> 30:29.328
Is it here, sir?

30:32.915 --> 30:37.462
Sir, we can assume that
they'll only enter this strait

30:37.462 --> 30:40.173
if they see it as an advantage.

30:41.424 --> 30:42.800
Look at those waves.

30:43.509 --> 30:48.389
They'll ride those waves
and ram into our ships.

30:48.723 --> 30:50.683
We don't stand a chance.

30:50.683 --> 30:53.811
That's why we need the turtle ship.

30:53.811 --> 30:56.022
Use it to break the front line,

30:56.022 --> 30:59.650
and our warships can fire
cannons from a distance.

30:59.650 --> 31:02.862
It takes half a day
for the tide to change,

31:02.862 --> 31:05.573
will the turtle ship hold?

31:16.792 --> 31:21.422
When the tide changes,
the sea calms considerably.

31:22.089 --> 31:24.800
But that sound...

31:26.469 --> 31:30.806
has changed from what is was before.

31:31.265 --> 31:35.937
It is like the sound of
a man's howling.

31:38.439 --> 31:41.234
The real problem is the whirlpool.

31:42.443 --> 31:47.907
You rarely hear the sound
during high tide.

31:47.907 --> 31:50.618
But if somehow
you should hear it then,

31:50.618 --> 31:52.620
a giant whirlpool appears.

31:54.914 --> 31:58.167
High tide comes in 2 days,

31:58.709 --> 32:01.170
and so it could only mean...

32:24.944 --> 32:27.071
Do you hear it?

32:28.447 --> 32:30.866
I hear that sound...

32:32.868 --> 32:37.039
as the howling of men
lost in Chilcheollyang.

32:39.542 --> 32:45.172
Is the turtle ship your only tactic?

32:49.635 --> 32:52.013
Tactics are not the problem.

32:52.638 --> 33:01.772
It's the fear that is spreading
among my men like a virus.

33:12.199 --> 33:14.118
Is there a way to overcome it?

33:17.705 --> 33:20.666
What are we to do if we cannot?

33:23.169 --> 33:28.049
Is beheading our own men,
like this morning,

33:28.215 --> 33:29.967
the only means of discipline?

33:31.719 --> 33:34.138
Can we achieve victory that way?

33:36.599 --> 33:39.101
But you...

33:39.101 --> 33:41.437
We can use it.

33:45.650 --> 33:47.068
You mean...

33:48.444 --> 33:49.654
the fear?

34:22.895 --> 34:24.688
Admiral...

34:26.899 --> 34:28.818
It is unjust...

34:36.909 --> 34:38.411
Admiral...

34:39.578 --> 34:42.706
Avenge us...

34:47.002 --> 34:49.380
Avenge us...

34:51.549 --> 34:53.676
So good to see you.

34:57.179 --> 34:59.682
Welcome, Hong-suk.

34:59.974 --> 35:03.561
Captain Choi, Captain Lee...

35:03.561 --> 35:06.063
Avenge us...

35:18.492 --> 35:20.077
Come...

35:21.829 --> 35:23.497
accept my drink.

35:28.461 --> 35:31.213
Please take this drink.

35:33.215 --> 35:34.341
Men...

35:36.135 --> 35:38.387
Where are you going?

35:38.387 --> 35:39.764
Captain Lee...

35:40.097 --> 35:43.476
Hong-suk...

35:46.687 --> 35:48.230
Please!

35:48.939 --> 35:52.276
Why must you rush off?

36:01.660 --> 36:02.453
Father!

36:22.765 --> 36:24.892
The turtle ship's on fire!

36:42.451 --> 36:43.452
Admiral!

36:51.210 --> 36:53.379
It's General Bae Seol's first mate.

37:00.719 --> 37:03.013
Put out the fire!

37:03.681 --> 37:05.558
Hurry!

37:05.975 --> 37:07.476
Put it out!

37:08.853 --> 37:11.647
Bring water!

37:12.690 --> 37:13.816
Over there!

37:22.491 --> 37:24.326
Hear me!

37:24.702 --> 37:27.246
Don't you want to live?!

37:27.580 --> 37:30.082
A dying man...

37:30.082 --> 37:32.877
is leading us to the gates of Hell!

37:34.253 --> 37:35.462
But, I...

37:36.922 --> 37:39.258
...have found a way out!

37:39.592 --> 37:42.887
Do not senselessly
throw away your lives!

37:43.304 --> 37:45.306
So join me!

38:08.579 --> 38:10.039
No...

38:10.873 --> 38:14.376
Can't be...

38:14.793 --> 38:18.380
Admiral, it's too dangerous!

38:19.423 --> 38:20.633
Please no!

38:21.634 --> 38:23.010
No!

38:25.471 --> 38:27.139
It can't be!

38:31.602 --> 38:33.520
No!

38:34.855 --> 38:36.899
- Admiral!
- Let me go!

38:38.025 --> 38:39.193
No!

38:39.568 --> 38:42.196
Our turtle ship!

38:43.364 --> 38:46.075
Father, it's all over!

38:46.075 --> 38:47.409
There's nothing we can do!

38:47.409 --> 38:50.245
Only one day from completion!

38:50.245 --> 38:53.499
I will face them with this turtle ship!

38:55.918 --> 38:59.213
No!

39:35.749 --> 39:38.419
Commander Todo! Commander Todo!

39:41.797 --> 39:44.717
Yi's turtle ship has burned.

39:45.259 --> 39:46.218
What?

39:46.218 --> 39:50.514
A scout was sent after spotting
fire and smoke from Yi's base,

39:50.514 --> 39:54.059
and the ship is now ashes!

39:55.769 --> 39:58.981
It was his last turtle
ship, was it not?

39:58.981 --> 40:00.941
Yes.

40:00.941 --> 40:04.778
Yi does not have any turtle ships left.

40:11.869 --> 40:14.455
Taito mumun...

40:14.455 --> 40:19.084
"Do not look back when
the only course is forward."

40:19.084 --> 40:25.966
I feel your great resolve
in the calligraphy.

40:30.929 --> 40:35.225
This is the spirit
we need at this junction.

40:40.314 --> 40:41.607
Prepare for battle!

40:51.992 --> 40:53.702
Prepare for battle!

40:56.080 --> 40:58.665
Junsa... where are you...

41:17.851 --> 41:19.186
What happened here?

41:19.186 --> 41:20.896
Help!

41:22.189 --> 41:23.232
Grab him!

41:29.113 --> 41:30.656
Get him!

41:40.082 --> 41:41.500
Please! Help me!

41:48.549 --> 41:50.008
Help me!

41:51.760 --> 41:53.178
Hurry up!

41:54.721 --> 41:56.223
Find the other one!

42:03.105 --> 42:04.356
Find him!

42:19.079 --> 42:20.372
Hurry up!

42:21.248 --> 42:22.583
March!

42:27.921 --> 42:30.966
I'm from a fishing village,

42:30.966 --> 42:35.387
and I can row very well!

42:35.929 --> 42:37.931
Really good rower! One of the best!
What's he jabbering?

42:41.810 --> 42:42.853
What the hell?

42:43.228 --> 42:44.188
Su-bong!

42:44.771 --> 42:46.481
You little rat!

42:48.901 --> 42:50.485
Wait! I'm sorry!

42:59.077 --> 43:01.163
Please don't kill me!

43:03.165 --> 43:04.291
Calm down!

44:14.611 --> 44:16.113
Whirlpool...

44:23.704 --> 44:25.372
Turtle ship...

44:41.221 --> 44:42.639
Father!

44:43.598 --> 44:44.433
Father!

44:45.642 --> 44:47.019
A message from Junsa!

44:49.187 --> 44:50.939
We'll reach Myeongnyang
tomorrow morning.

44:50.939 --> 44:56.445
We deploy with the tide,
and the fleet is over 330 ships.

44:56.445 --> 45:01.575
Captain of the vanguard is,
unfortunately, someone new.

45:01.575 --> 45:05.704
His name is Kurushima,
known as the Pirate King,

45:05.704 --> 45:07.706
and versed in similar conditions.

45:07.706 --> 45:12.044
Fortunately, backing him up
is General Wakizaka,

45:12.044 --> 45:14.087
whom you defeated in Hansan.

45:14.087 --> 45:16.340
I hope you find some comfort in this.

45:16.340 --> 45:20.052
I will join you once I fulfill my duty.

45:25.140 --> 45:26.683
Let's go to Usuyeong.

45:26.683 --> 45:29.811
- Sir?
- We cannot fight with the strait behind us.

45:29.811 --> 45:32.439
We must move our men now!

46:03.220 --> 46:04.721
To war!

46:07.808 --> 46:11.228
Run as fast as the wind,
stand still as the trees

46:28.537 --> 46:31.206
A message from General Konishi.

46:36.628 --> 46:39.965
He's pressing me.

46:39.965 --> 46:44.428
We will reach the king before him.

46:44.678 --> 46:46.721
We're ready for deployment.

46:47.472 --> 46:52.018
Joseon looks particularly savory today.

46:53.019 --> 46:56.398
I like this land.

47:14.291 --> 47:15.000
Captain.

47:16.251 --> 47:17.461
Status.

47:19.838 --> 47:21.256
All prepared, sir.

47:21.590 --> 47:24.885
There are only POWs below deck,

47:24.885 --> 47:27.429
and we've stockpiled the gunpowder.

47:29.264 --> 47:30.307
Yi Sun-shin...

47:30.849 --> 47:34.019
will not survive this.

47:57.709 --> 47:58.919
To war!

48:13.642 --> 48:15.560
Not even a turtle ship!

48:15.560 --> 48:19.105
Does a single line formation
even qualify as a tactic?!

48:19.105 --> 48:20.941
Has the admiral gone mad?

48:20.941 --> 48:21.900
He's right!

48:21.900 --> 48:23.777
Just listen to that!

48:24.069 --> 48:26.029
We can't all die in vain.

48:26.363 --> 48:28.573
We must come up with a new plan!

48:28.573 --> 48:29.908
A new plan!

48:29.908 --> 48:32.410
And what could that be?

48:32.744 --> 48:36.581
Could you be implying that
we assassinate the admiral?

48:36.998 --> 48:38.208
No!

48:40.126 --> 48:42.254
That's not what I'm saying!

48:42.254 --> 48:44.631
Time is of the essence,

48:44.923 --> 48:48.760
and we can't even send
a message up the ranks.

48:51.012 --> 48:51.930
Let's go to him.

48:54.558 --> 48:55.517
To who?

49:01.731 --> 49:05.235
I'll convince the admiral, if not...

49:06.403 --> 49:09.406
I'll offer up my life instead.

49:15.579 --> 49:17.122
<i>Your majesty,</i>

49:17.581 --> 49:22.168
<i>if you disband the navy now,</i>

49:22.502 --> 49:29.009
<i>I'm afraid the enemy will
reach you unimpeded.</i>

49:30.802 --> 49:35.390
<i>I still have 12 ships at my command.</i>

49:36.391 --> 49:41.730
<i>If we fight to our last breath,
it is not impossible.</i>

49:42.897 --> 49:46.443
<i>As long as I still breathe...</i>

49:58.079 --> 50:03.918
<i>the enemy shall never
feel safe on our soil.</i>

50:28.068 --> 50:28.818
Admiral.

50:29.444 --> 50:33.657
At the risk of my own life,
I'd like to speak my mind.

50:37.410 --> 50:38.912
Sir!

50:39.871 --> 50:41.581
This battle is futile!

50:42.707 --> 50:43.958
It's futile!

50:44.167 --> 50:47.837
Even if we lure the enemy
into the narrow strait,

50:48.213 --> 50:52.384
we cannot face them
without a single turtle ship!

50:52.384 --> 50:55.553
Save this battle
for another day! Please!

50:55.553 --> 50:56.721
Please!

51:06.981 --> 51:09.526
Is that how you really feel?

51:12.070 --> 51:17.158
Please take my life,
if you believe otherwise.

51:17.534 --> 51:20.787
I'd rather die by your sword!

51:38.430 --> 51:43.143
If that is how you feel, very well.

51:43.727 --> 51:48.815
Gather all the men
in front of the camp.

51:55.196 --> 51:56.239
Yes, sir!

51:57.991 --> 51:58.658
Yes, sir!

52:08.543 --> 52:10.837
General

52:23.767 --> 52:26.895
Captains Kim and Hwang,
have you brought it?

52:26.895 --> 52:28.062
Yes, admiral!

52:28.313 --> 52:29.439
Pour it!

52:34.277 --> 52:36.362
What are you waiting for?

52:37.489 --> 52:39.157
- Pour it!
- Yes, sir!

52:51.628 --> 52:52.712
Light it!

52:52.712 --> 52:53.922
Sir!

52:54.589 --> 52:55.465
Admiral Yi!

53:10.480 --> 53:11.648
Stand back!

53:17.237 --> 53:23.201
It's shameful that you still
only consider your own lives!

53:25.620 --> 53:26.538
Death...

53:28.748 --> 53:30.667
is unavoidable!

53:32.919 --> 53:35.880
Is avoiding combat
the path to survival?

53:37.340 --> 53:39.592
Will we be safe on land?

53:43.429 --> 53:45.098
Behold!

53:47.100 --> 53:51.312
I am burning this land
so that I can die at sea.

53:52.981 --> 53:58.278
This is where we stand and fight!

54:01.990 --> 54:04.200
Do not hold onto life!

54:06.911 --> 54:10.248
If you crave life, you will surely die!

54:10.957 --> 54:14.085
If you fight to the death, you will live!

54:14.711 --> 54:23.011
One man at the strategic point
can fend off a thousand men!

54:24.470 --> 54:30.351
Those words were spoken
to describe our situation now!

55:04.427 --> 55:05.678
<i>Father.</i>

55:06.721 --> 55:12.602
<i>How will you utilize
this cancerous fear?</i>

55:32.580 --> 55:36.250
Is this Captain Bae Hong-suk's son?

55:36.709 --> 55:37.835
Yes, sir.

55:38.169 --> 55:41.547
He brought Junsa's message
instead of our scout.

55:42.006 --> 55:46.886
Junsa encountered him
by chance and helped him escape.

55:57.772 --> 56:00.024
This was your father's.

56:02.318 --> 56:03.945
Will you accept it?

56:15.456 --> 56:16.874
What is your name?

56:18.960 --> 56:20.336
Bae Su-bong, sir.

56:21.212 --> 56:23.006
With your father by my side,

56:24.674 --> 56:27.468
we fought for 6 years.

56:28.469 --> 56:32.181
I will not forget your
father and your names.

56:45.820 --> 56:47.030
I...

56:47.780 --> 56:49.157
I have a request, sir.

56:50.700 --> 56:51.659
Go on.

56:51.909 --> 56:56.039
Please allow me to board
your ship and fight for you!

57:01.419 --> 57:04.422
Only if you'll take an oar
rather than a sword.

57:05.381 --> 57:06.466
Thank you.

57:06.883 --> 57:07.925
Thank you!

58:10.321 --> 58:11.739
<i>Mother.</i>

58:12.573 --> 58:17.912
<i>I must be off now.</i>

58:23.501 --> 58:29.799
<i>My only wish is that
our death will not be in vain.</i>

59:52.757 --> 59:53.507
Admiral.

59:53.799 --> 59:55.218
Good work.

59:56.677 --> 59:58.888
We offer you our assistance.

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:03.226
It is greatly appreciated.

01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:10.107
Admiral!

01:00:15.321 --> 01:00:16.489
Junsa, thank you.

01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:50.564
Full deployment.

01:00:54.318 --> 01:00:57.238
Full deployment!

01:01:07.957 --> 01:01:10.418
Let's go to war!

01:01:11.127 --> 01:01:13.379
Deploy!

01:01:13.879 --> 01:01:16.257
Deploy!

01:03:18.379 --> 01:03:19.797
Battle formation.

01:03:39.191 --> 01:03:42.611
The current's pushing us back!
Row harder!

01:03:43.028 --> 01:03:45.489
Drum louder!

01:03:54.290 --> 01:03:55.708
Load the cannons!

01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:19.607
We must hold our position!

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:22.109
Row harder!

01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:51.388
Get rid of it.

01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:43.899
- Look!
- What is that?

01:05:43.899 --> 01:05:45.609
What's that black mass?

01:06:07.548 --> 01:06:09.466
Our fleet!

01:06:13.429 --> 01:06:15.055
Close the lid!

01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:20.019
Su-bong, I think
we boarded the wrong ship.

01:06:20.019 --> 01:06:21.979
Didn't know it was the flagship?

01:06:22.646 --> 01:06:26.442
But why must the flagship
be at the front?!

01:06:31.030 --> 01:06:33.198
I'll order our fleet to
remain in formation!

01:06:35.451 --> 01:06:36.535
Let them be.

01:06:37.578 --> 01:06:39.622
Sir? But admiral...

01:06:39.913 --> 01:06:42.499
Lower the anchor
and prepare for battle.

01:06:48.547 --> 01:06:50.758
Lower the anchor!

01:07:19.203 --> 01:07:23.165
Why isn't Yi raising his command ﬂag?

01:07:24.083 --> 01:07:25.834
Just look at them.

01:07:26.835 --> 01:07:30.089
Even if he did, would
his men follow him?

01:07:36.136 --> 01:07:38.305
Vanguard 1, advance.

01:07:38.305 --> 01:07:40.474
Vanguard 1!

01:07:40.933 --> 01:07:42.851
Advance!

01:08:11.296 --> 01:08:13.257
Rotate starboard
and prepare the cannons.

01:08:13.257 --> 01:08:15.300
Prepare the cannons!

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:18.970
Starboard oars, stop!

01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:22.474
Port oars, row faster!

01:08:32.024 --> 01:08:33.068
Lieutenant Nah!

01:08:33.068 --> 01:08:34.278
Captain Song!

01:08:34.778 --> 01:08:38.490
Aim all cannons and explosive
arrows at their vanguard ships!

01:08:38.741 --> 01:08:39.700
Yes, sir!

01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:43.787
Aim the cannons at the vanguard!

01:08:43.787 --> 01:08:45.956
Archers, battle station!

01:08:46.582 --> 01:08:47.541
Aim!

01:08:56.759 --> 01:08:57.926
Prepare to fire!

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:01.596
Ready!

01:09:02.639 --> 01:09:03.807
Fire!

01:09:30.959 --> 01:09:33.170
The current is picking up,
steer carefully!

01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:34.171
Ready to fire!

01:09:44.305 --> 01:09:47.225
- Fire!
- Fire!

01:10:13.335 --> 01:10:14.294
Now!

01:10:27.683 --> 01:10:31.270
Increase speed and rotate to port!

01:10:40.612 --> 01:10:42.030
Fire!

01:10:57.212 --> 01:10:59.798
Watch out!

01:11:13.186 --> 01:11:13.896
Fire!

01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:35.500
Yi is concentrating attack
on the front line.

01:11:35.918 --> 01:11:39.004
Vanguard ships are
colliding into one another.

01:11:39.004 --> 01:11:43.258
Yi's holding his position.

01:11:44.426 --> 01:11:46.970
Could he be waiting for something?

01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:50.140
Shouldn't we join the assault
and reinforce the front?

01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:54.937
No...

01:11:55.187 --> 01:11:57.439
Wait a little longer.

01:12:03.445 --> 01:12:08.909
Fear does not discriminate,
it can equally affect our enemy.

01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:15.040
Six years of defeat have
planted fear in their men, too.

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:18.835
Fear does not discriminate...

01:12:25.425 --> 01:12:26.843
Is that all?

01:12:27.886 --> 01:12:29.721
Is that how we use fear?

01:12:30.639 --> 01:12:36.228
If only we can turn fear into courage.

01:12:46.905 --> 01:12:50.450
Send in vanguard 2, and press harder.

01:12:51.618 --> 01:12:53.787
Vanguard 2!

01:12:54.079 --> 01:12:55.580
Advance!

01:12:58.959 --> 01:13:03.046
Kurushima keeps sending in ships.

01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:06.550
He's very skilled
in handling strong tides.

01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:09.344
Let's wait and see.

01:13:14.891 --> 01:13:16.309
Just watch.

01:13:16.935 --> 01:13:20.147
The current is on our side.

01:13:20.397 --> 01:13:23.650
We will demolish them.

01:13:41.501 --> 01:13:45.630
Admiral! Due to the current,
our accuracy has gone down!

01:13:47.007 --> 01:13:48.050
Cut the anchor lose.

01:13:48.675 --> 01:13:51.887
Ride the current towards Blood Isle.

01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:54.639
Right away!

01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:12.449
They're trapped.

01:14:12.449 --> 01:14:13.784
Fire!

01:14:23.043 --> 01:14:24.377
Get the poles!

01:14:29.633 --> 01:14:31.510
Port oars, row harder!

01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:33.804
We mustn't hit the rocks!

01:14:38.517 --> 01:14:40.977
Sir! We must alert our fleet!

01:14:40.977 --> 01:14:43.480
We won't last long
at our current position!

01:14:44.439 --> 01:14:48.318
Switch to shrapnel shells.

01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:52.739
And prepare for close combat.

01:15:01.456 --> 01:15:02.541
Get ready!

01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:05.961
For close combat!

01:16:13.236 --> 01:16:14.237
Now!

01:16:25.248 --> 01:16:26.249
Fire!

01:16:54.861 --> 01:16:56.321
Board!

01:19:01.446 --> 01:19:05.116
Kurushima is about to win the battle!

01:19:05.325 --> 01:19:09.037
Yi held his ground long enough.

01:19:18.546 --> 01:19:22.050
We're all going to die!

01:19:25.136 --> 01:19:27.180
Admiral!

01:20:52.891 --> 01:20:53.600
Admiral!

01:20:54.058 --> 01:20:58.605
Gather all cannons
to the port oar of the ship.

01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:00.356
Can you do it?

01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:05.445
But we could all die!

01:21:05.445 --> 01:21:06.988
Just get it done!

01:21:09.866 --> 01:21:12.076
Yes, sir! It will be done!

01:21:14.996 --> 01:21:16.206
Hold your ground!

01:21:26.216 --> 01:21:29.469
Place cannons on port oar opening!

01:21:29.928 --> 01:21:31.179
What are you waiting for?!

01:21:31.179 --> 01:21:33.640
Get the shells!

01:21:34.015 --> 01:21:36.226
- It's too dangerous, don't do it!
- Hurry up!

01:21:59.999 --> 01:22:03.169
Gather the shells and gunpowder!

01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:08.675
On the double!

01:22:30.530 --> 01:22:36.953
One swing of this sword,
blood will spread

01:22:47.338 --> 01:22:48.840
Admiral!

01:22:49.048 --> 01:22:51.467
We're ready!

01:22:52.635 --> 01:22:56.431
Brace yourselves!

01:22:57.432 --> 01:22:59.767
Brace yourselves!

01:22:59.767 --> 01:23:01.561
Hit the deck!

01:23:21.581 --> 01:23:23.958
Is that how we use fear?

01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:30.048
If only we can turn fear into courage...

01:23:34.802 --> 01:23:39.974
It will inspire even more courage.

01:23:42.352 --> 01:23:43.686
But father...

01:23:45.647 --> 01:23:51.319
How can we possibly inspire
such courage in our men?

01:23:55.907 --> 01:23:58.159
I must be sacrificed.

01:24:08.670 --> 01:24:10.046
Could this be...

01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:12.340
the end?

01:24:24.977 --> 01:24:25.687
Look!

01:24:59.011 --> 01:25:00.972
The flagship survived!

01:25:00.972 --> 01:25:03.015
It's still standing!

01:25:07.478 --> 01:25:09.814
The flagship survived!

01:25:15.737 --> 01:25:18.448
Destroy the enemy!

01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:27.498
Sons of bitches!

01:25:28.291 --> 01:25:30.042
I'll kill them all!

01:25:30.418 --> 01:25:32.128
I want to kill, too!

01:25:59.739 --> 01:26:01.657
Full speed ahead!

01:26:01.908 --> 01:26:03.493
Full speed ahead!

01:26:33.564 --> 01:26:34.816
Whirlpool...

01:26:37.109 --> 01:26:38.444
It's the whirlpool...

01:26:41.197 --> 01:26:43.658
Yi Sun-shin...

01:26:53.584 --> 01:26:57.588
So there was a reason
why you were holding out there.

01:26:58.339 --> 01:27:02.260
The current has changed,
a large whirlpool is forming!

01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:05.638
Thanks to that, the water
near the isle is calm,

01:27:05.638 --> 01:27:08.140
which greatly increases their accuracy.

01:27:08.558 --> 01:27:13.938
If he holes up there,
no one can pass the strait.

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:16.566
And the battle will be over.

01:27:16.566 --> 01:27:23.906
Maximum speed to the flagship,
before he gets in formation!

01:27:29.287 --> 01:27:31.747
Sir, that's their main fleet.

01:27:44.051 --> 01:27:45.344
Raise the flag.

01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:46.679
Yes, sir.

01:29:35.788 --> 01:29:36.789
<i>You're mine.</i>

01:30:18.706 --> 01:30:20.166
Admiral!

01:30:21.542 --> 01:30:22.626
Captain Ahn!

01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:26.255
You must be disciplined
under strict martial law,

01:30:26.630 --> 01:30:28.799
but as we're at war,

01:30:29.175 --> 01:30:31.135
I command you to fight to the death!

01:30:31.469 --> 01:30:34.638
Defend Blood Isle with your life!

01:30:35.306 --> 01:30:36.390
Understood?!

01:30:37.725 --> 01:30:39.435
Yes, admiral!

01:30:40.269 --> 01:30:43.606
We must reach the center
of the strait quickly.

01:30:43.981 --> 01:30:44.857
Yes, admiral!

01:30:45.900 --> 01:30:48.944
To the center of the strait!

01:31:15.221 --> 01:31:17.389
Impeccable timing, sir.

01:31:17.598 --> 01:31:20.392
The explosion will be massive.

01:31:20.768 --> 01:31:24.438
We won't fall for Yi's decoy.

01:31:24.897 --> 01:31:28.317
Our main fleet will
continue towards the isle.

01:31:30.569 --> 01:31:31.487
Sir!

01:31:34.657 --> 01:31:37.034
A straw-covered ship is approaching!

01:31:39.036 --> 01:31:40.496
Archers in formation!

01:31:40.496 --> 01:31:41.539
Yes, sir!

01:31:42.957 --> 01:31:43.749
Fire!

01:31:52.091 --> 01:31:54.093
We're sitting ducks!

01:31:54.093 --> 01:31:55.719
Haul out the water!

01:31:56.262 --> 01:31:57.555
Hurry!

01:31:58.514 --> 01:32:01.267
We're out of shells on the deck!

01:32:45.519 --> 01:32:46.896
It severed my chain!

01:32:47.104 --> 01:32:48.564
Grab his sword!

01:33:04.830 --> 01:33:05.789
Lim Jun-young?

01:33:07.208 --> 01:33:08.167
Junsa!

01:33:11.170 --> 01:33:12.838
It's carrying gunpowder?

01:33:21.639 --> 01:33:24.808
Admiral, that vessel is
carrying gunpowder.

01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:28.187
Our scout Lim is on board.

01:34:31.959 --> 01:34:34.503
No response from Ahn's ship?!

01:34:35.629 --> 01:34:38.257
Load the cannons immediately!

01:34:39.550 --> 01:34:42.428
Admiral, there's no answer!

01:35:03.991 --> 01:35:09.663
Wave something and
make them fire at me!

01:35:16.587 --> 01:35:20.257
This ship...

01:35:22.259 --> 01:35:24.178
mustn't reach the admiral!

01:35:28.766 --> 01:35:30.893
You must!

01:35:52.539 --> 01:35:53.999
Good...

01:35:55.376 --> 01:35:56.877
That's it...

01:36:02.341 --> 01:36:03.675
Let's all signal!

01:36:03.675 --> 01:36:04.968
Everyone, hurry!

01:36:20.901 --> 01:36:21.819
Captain!

01:36:23.529 --> 01:36:24.613
Over there!

01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:35.582
A straw ship heading for the flagship!

01:36:40.087 --> 01:36:41.672
Get ready to fire!

01:36:41.839 --> 01:36:42.798
Yes, sir!

01:37:30.679 --> 01:37:31.805
Ready!

01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:37.144
Fire!

01:37:42.399 --> 01:37:44.109
Good work.

01:37:45.110 --> 01:37:47.696
So happy to see you,

01:37:50.073 --> 01:37:51.909
one last time...

01:38:47.297 --> 01:38:48.090
Admiral!

01:38:48.590 --> 01:38:50.759
Their vanguard flagship
is heading for us!

01:39:07.401 --> 01:39:10.862
The enemy's coming!

01:39:10.862 --> 01:39:12.656
Grab your oars!

01:39:39.516 --> 01:39:41.852
Finish him off!

01:40:31.526 --> 01:40:32.986
Close combat!

01:40:32.986 --> 01:40:34.696
Board their ship!

01:40:54.758 --> 01:40:55.509
Kuroda!

01:40:55.509 --> 01:40:56.176
Hurry!

01:40:56.426 --> 01:40:57.844
Should we reinforce?

01:41:11.608 --> 01:41:13.068
We're shorthanded!

01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:16.863
Let's reinforce our men on the deck!

01:41:23.495 --> 01:41:24.579
Su-bong!

01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:25.872
Su-bong!

01:43:15.565 --> 01:43:18.985
Yi Sun-shin! You're mine!

01:43:44.928 --> 01:43:48.348
Admiral! Our ships have
come to our aid!

01:44:03.488 --> 01:44:04.239
Kimura!

01:44:06.867 --> 01:44:08.368
Catch up to them!

01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:11.746
We've lost control...

01:44:16.376 --> 01:44:17.127
Load!

01:44:17.919 --> 01:44:19.379
Fire!

01:44:30.807 --> 01:44:33.727
You must request reinforcements!

01:44:33.727 --> 01:44:35.228
There is none.

01:44:36.813 --> 01:44:40.775
We're on our own.

01:44:46.489 --> 01:44:49.659
Shouldn't we reinforce them?

01:45:12.307 --> 01:45:14.643
Yi Sun-shin.

01:45:51.596 --> 01:45:53.014
Are you...

01:45:53.848 --> 01:45:59.062
a spy or a traitor?!

01:46:32.220 --> 01:46:38.184
Yi Sun-shin!

01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:21.454
Sir.

01:48:22.247 --> 01:48:25.875
I'm afraid our ship is failing...

01:49:28.021 --> 01:49:30.064
Admiral!

01:49:30.064 --> 01:49:32.609
We'll pull you out!

01:49:55.006 --> 01:49:56.132
Admiral!

01:49:57.258 --> 01:49:59.385
Our fleet is coming!

01:50:13.483 --> 01:50:16.527
We must destroy them
before they get into formation!

01:50:17.070 --> 01:50:19.197
Why aren't we going faster?!

01:50:19.197 --> 01:50:21.407
But the tide has turned...

01:50:21.824 --> 01:50:22.992
I know that!

01:50:22.992 --> 01:50:25.828
Whip the rowers to row faster!

01:50:25.828 --> 01:50:27.372
Speed! I need speed!

01:50:27.372 --> 01:50:29.874
That's our only chance!

01:50:30.500 --> 01:50:31.626
Full speed!

01:50:45.848 --> 01:50:47.809
Don't let go of the oars!

01:50:48.559 --> 01:50:50.186
Hang in there!

01:50:52.438 --> 01:50:54.899
When will this end, damn it?!

01:51:13.376 --> 01:51:14.627
We're free!

01:51:47.327 --> 01:51:48.286
Admiral!

01:52:23.154 --> 01:52:24.238
Here is my order!

01:52:30.286 --> 01:52:32.205
General

01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:40.088
It can't be...

01:53:05.238 --> 01:53:06.656
Brace for impact!

01:53:07.156 --> 01:53:10.618
They're coming in hard!

01:53:44.444 --> 01:53:47.822
No!

01:54:10.887 --> 01:54:13.723
Please, hold on a bit longer.

01:54:26.110 --> 01:54:27.945
They broke the front line.

01:54:28.988 --> 01:54:30.531
Risen from the dead!

01:54:31.157 --> 01:54:34.744
Rebirth of the turtle ship!

01:54:35.578 --> 01:54:40.458
It has returned!

01:55:06.359 --> 01:55:08.444
Was that...

01:55:08.819 --> 01:55:11.822
a part of his plan all along?

01:55:28.047 --> 01:55:30.716
They're fleeing! Look at them!

01:55:37.598 --> 01:55:39.725
Fire!

01:55:52.363 --> 01:55:55.324
Do not look back when the only course is forward

01:55:59.745 --> 01:56:01.872
Yi Sun-shin...

01:56:06.210 --> 01:56:07.753
Retreat!

01:56:26.981 --> 01:56:28.691
Turn the ship around.

01:56:29.984 --> 01:56:32.862
The tide has again turned in our favor.

01:56:41.579 --> 01:56:44.457
Battle report!

01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:48.002
31 ships destroyed!

01:56:48.586 --> 01:56:52.298
No ally ships lost!

01:56:52.715 --> 01:56:58.596
Invade all they want, they can't
do nothing on our watch!

01:56:58.596 --> 01:57:03.517
- Have some.
- I'm already full!

01:57:04.518 --> 01:57:09.148
I looked one in the eye
and he pissed his pants!

01:57:09.148 --> 01:57:10.983
I'm the best!

01:57:13.819 --> 01:57:17.448
Will history remember
how hard we fought?

01:57:17.448 --> 01:57:21.202
Every damn minute.

01:57:21.577 --> 01:57:23.746
You speak the truth!

01:57:23.746 --> 01:57:28.501
We're still breathing,
it's time to go back home.

01:57:28.501 --> 01:57:29.627
You said it!

01:57:30.002 --> 01:57:32.672
Here, have a drink!

01:57:39.095 --> 01:57:40.596
Isn't this taro?

01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:51.774
It feels good to eat.

01:58:09.917 --> 01:58:12.336
Admiral!

01:58:12.795 --> 01:58:15.673
Admiral!

01:58:54.295 --> 01:58:56.630
How can we ease...

01:58:59.675 --> 01:59:01.677
their suffering...

01:59:16.692 --> 01:59:18.027
Father.

01:59:21.030 --> 01:59:25.534
How did you think of
using the whirlpool?

01:59:27.328 --> 01:59:28.579
Father?

01:59:32.500 --> 01:59:34.668
What did you ask me?

01:59:36.086 --> 01:59:40.758
The whirlpool appeared at our
most desperate moment.

01:59:40.758 --> 01:59:42.885
If it weren't for that...

01:59:49.225 --> 01:59:51.018
It was the grace of God.

01:59:52.144 --> 01:59:53.854
The grace of God?

01:59:53.854 --> 01:59:58.275
You mean we could've
been defeated?

01:59:59.360 --> 02:00:03.155
Yes, indeed.

02:00:04.448 --> 02:00:09.495
If the peasants didn't save me then...

02:00:12.206 --> 02:00:15.125
Peasants were the grace of God?

02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:17.962
Not the whirlpool?

02:00:26.929 --> 02:00:32.268
Which do you think it is?

02:01:46.508 --> 02:01:47.927
There...

02:01:49.678 --> 02:01:50.888
What is that?

02:02:56.120 --> 02:02:59.415
CHOI MIN-SIK

02:02:59.415 --> 02:03:02.876
RYU SEUNG-RYONG

02:03:02.876 --> 02:03:06.255
