WEBVTT

00:01.200 --> 00:04.431
Do you just get up in the morning
and figure out ways to make me crazy?

00:04.600 --> 00:06.238
Is that what you do?
You plot it out?

00:06.400 --> 00:08.038
How can I make Alan
miserable today?

00:08.200 --> 00:09.918
How can I reach into his chest...

00:10.120 --> 00:12.918
...rip out his heart, and suck it dry?

00:14.240 --> 00:16.834
- Mom or ex-wife?
- Ex-wife.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.430
- Hi, Judith.
- Charlie says hello.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.989
She says hi.
You're evil and selfish, you know that?

00:22.960 --> 00:25.030
No, no. L... I think that is
a helpful comment.

00:25.200 --> 00:28.510
I pay you alimony and child support
so that you can have a nice house...

00:28.680 --> 00:31.240
...a nice car, every weekend free
because I've got Jake.

00:31.440 --> 00:35.115
And yet you're telling me
you need a vacation?

00:35.280 --> 00:38.716
Oh, really? Oh, really? And what exactly
is stressing you out, Judith?

00:38.880 --> 00:41.474
Is it the weekly manicure?
The housekeeper?

00:41.640 --> 00:43.517
- Boob lift.
- The boob lift.

00:43.720 --> 00:45.597
- That you paid for.
- That I paid for.

00:45.800 --> 00:48.394
- And never got to see.
- And never got to see.

00:49.880 --> 00:51.472
No, no, no. You listen to me.

00:51.640 --> 00:53.596
I think you live a damn fine lifestyle...

00:53.760 --> 00:55.955
...that I work 60 hours a week
to support.

00:56.120 --> 01:00.113
So if anybody needs a vacation,
it's not you. It's me!

01:00.680 --> 01:02.557
All right, then.

01:03.360 --> 01:04.952
Goodbye.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.794
Judith's going to Hawaii for a week.

01:11.800 --> 01:13.119
So Jake's staying here.

01:13.560 --> 01:15.471
I'm shocked.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.074

01:24.440 --> 01:26.829
Come on, Jake.
It's time to get up for school.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.353
I can't go to school.

01:28.520 --> 01:30.351
- I'm sick.
- What's wrong?

01:30.840 --> 01:33.479
I think I have acid reflex disease.

01:33.680 --> 01:37.389
Really? Acid reflex disease?

01:38.200 --> 01:39.918
Where does it hurt?

01:41.320 --> 01:42.958
My head?

01:43.720 --> 01:45.711
- Nice try.
- My throat?

01:45.920 --> 01:47.273
Get up.

01:48.920 --> 01:50.273
All right, all right.

01:50.440 --> 01:53.432
I just want you to know,
I'm starting my day really stressed out.

01:53.640 --> 01:56.632
Oh, I'm sorry. Would you like me
to send you to Hawaii?

01:56.840 --> 01:58.796
That would be nice.

02:02.720 --> 02:05.359
What's taking you so long?

02:05.880 --> 02:08.678
- I can't find my other shoe.
- So put on a different pair.

02:08.840 --> 02:10.158
But this one's on already.

02:13.080 --> 02:15.275
Hey, what are you doing up so late?

02:15.720 --> 02:17.438
It's 7 a.m.

02:18.760 --> 02:21.672
- What am I doing up so early?
- Where have you been?

02:21.880 --> 02:25.555
Searching the kingdom
for the woman who fits this shoe.

02:26.120 --> 02:27.678
Hey, that's mine. Where was it?

02:27.960 --> 02:29.075
In the driveway.

02:29.920 --> 02:31.717
Oh, yeah!

02:32.080 --> 02:33.354
Okay, let's go.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.192
- Got my lunch?
- Lunch?

02:35.400 --> 02:38.631
- You're supposed to make me lunch.
- Oh, crap.

02:39.480 --> 02:41.948
This isn't helping my stress level.

02:43.360 --> 02:45.749
I forget. Why are you here
in the middle of the week?

02:45.960 --> 02:48.918
- Because my mom's on vacation.
- From what?

02:49.320 --> 02:50.673
Me.

02:54.320 --> 02:57.232
A word of advice: Don't date women
who live near the airport.

02:57.680 --> 03:00.148
It's impossible to sleep in.

03:00.760 --> 03:03.069
I'll try to remember that.

03:03.280 --> 03:06.192
Wish I knew her well enough
to bring her back here.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.555
Well, maybe next time.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.358
Next time?

03:10.880 --> 03:13.599
- My lunch ready?
- It's right here. What are you doing?

03:13.760 --> 03:16.115
- That was for Jake.
- I don't see his name on it.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.389
Okay, fine. You'Il...
You'll have half a sandwich...

03:24.560 --> 03:28.553
...and a banana,
and maybe an orange, and...

03:28.720 --> 03:31.234
...what the hell, an artichoke.

03:32.680 --> 03:33.669
An artichoke?

03:35.000 --> 03:37.150
Maybe you can trade it
for something good.

03:37.880 --> 03:40.075
With who? One of the slow kids?

03:40.280 --> 03:42.589
Give it a shot. Tell him it's a puppy.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.472
Come on, let's go.

03:46.400 --> 03:50.029
I forgot. I have to write five insightful
questions I'd ask George Washington.

03:50.240 --> 03:52.390
What? Last night
you said you had no homework.

03:52.760 --> 03:55.115
Dad, I just said I forgot.

03:57.240 --> 04:01.836
- Okay, fine. You'll do it in the car.
- I was planning on doing math in the car.

04:03.920 --> 04:05.353
President Washington.

04:05.520 --> 04:07.272
Question number one:

04:07.440 --> 04:11.194
"Have you ever thought of coming
back from the dead as a zombie?"

04:12.760 --> 04:15.354
Jake, I don't think that's
what your teacher had in mind.

04:15.960 --> 04:17.473
Do you wanna do it?

04:18.079 --> 04:19.433
No, no. You're doing fine.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.036
Question two:

04:22.200 --> 04:25.351
"Can you eat human flesh
with wooden teeth?"

04:26.960 --> 04:29.190
Hi, Lorraine. I'm running a little late.

04:29.360 --> 04:33.353
Could you move my 9:30 to 10,
my 10 to 10:30...

04:33.520 --> 04:36.080
...and, well,
you see where this is going.

04:37.120 --> 04:38.678
You don't?

04:39.640 --> 04:41.870
Hang on, I've got somebody
on the other line.

04:42.480 --> 04:43.879
Hello.

04:44.040 --> 04:48.192
Oh, hi, Mom. Look, I can't talk
right now. I'm driving Jake to school.

04:48.400 --> 04:50.868
Well, Judith's in Hawaii.

04:51.400 --> 04:54.073
No, that does not make me
a doormat.

04:55.160 --> 04:58.072
Patsy is just another word
for doormat, Mom.

04:58.440 --> 05:01.477
L... Lo... I gotta go. I'll call you later.

05:03.160 --> 05:04.513
Hi, Lorraine. I'm back.

05:04.720 --> 05:06.631
No, no, don't put me on hold.

05:07.120 --> 05:08.473
Question three:

05:08.840 --> 05:12.071
"Do you think the Revolutionary War
would have been won sooner...

05:12.240 --> 05:14.993
...if you had an army of the undead?"

05:17.400 --> 05:19.789
This is actually pretty easy.

05:20.520 --> 05:23.273
Lorraine, this is Dr. Harper.

05:24.040 --> 05:27.032
Listen, I'm... I'm gonna be there
in about 40 minutes.

05:27.440 --> 05:29.715
What do you mean,
you're going home?

05:29.920 --> 05:33.356
Oh, come on.
You were premenstrual two weeks ago.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.956
Yes, I keep track.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.198
Question number four:

05:38.360 --> 05:42.433
"What's your opinion of the new,
faster-walking zombies?"

05:42.800 --> 05:44.438
No, no, no. Lor... Lorraine.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.272
Don't cry. Please don't cry.

05:52.040 --> 05:54.349
Charlie, I'm going home.

06:13.840 --> 06:17.389
How many times
have I asked you not to do that?

06:17.800 --> 06:20.997
- I'm going home.
- I suppose you want me to pay you.

06:21.200 --> 06:24.158
Not necessary.
I took the money out of your wallet.

06:25.720 --> 06:28.951
- Fine.
- Guess what? I got a raise.

06:30.120 --> 06:31.678
Congratulations.

06:31.880 --> 06:36.715
- You wanna know why I got a raise?
- No, I'm sure I had my reasons.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.709
Because when I took this job,
all I had to do was clean up after you.

06:41.920 --> 06:44.718
And while that may
have been disgusting, it was doable.

06:45.760 --> 06:50.390
And then your brother moved in, which
I accepted with my usual good humor...

06:50.560 --> 06:54.678
...because he cleans up after himself
like a neurotic raccoon.

06:55.840 --> 06:57.432
This is about the kid, right?

06:57.640 --> 07:00.598
Good for you.
That's why you're the boss.

07:01.760 --> 07:04.752
He's just here for a week.
It's a temporary situation.

07:04.960 --> 07:07.554
And yet my raise is permanent.

07:08.480 --> 07:09.879
Sounds fair.

07:10.320 --> 07:12.276
God, what a horrible day.

07:12.720 --> 07:14.836
- Tell me about it.
- Show of hands:

07:15.280 --> 07:17.714
Who spent their day
pre-soaking the shorts of a kid...

07:17.920 --> 07:20.753
...who leaves more skid marks
than a getaway car?

07:22.440 --> 07:23.953
That's what I thought.

07:24.120 --> 07:26.475
Now, if you ladies will excuse me...

07:27.160 --> 07:30.470
...I have three buses to catch.

07:33.840 --> 07:36.274
I bet she catches them by hand.

07:37.440 --> 07:39.556
Yeah, well, I have my own problems.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.473
I was late for work,
my receptionist went home early...

07:42.640 --> 07:46.519
...because, apparently, she has
the reproductive cycle of a jackrabbit...

07:46.960 --> 07:50.396
...and then I had a large,
drunk Samoan man walk in...

07:50.560 --> 07:54.838
...who thought that chiropractor means
"massage with happy ending."

07:56.320 --> 08:00.199
I kept trying to crack his back and
he kept rolling over and winking at me.

08:01.160 --> 08:03.310
- Wow, that's creepy.
- Tell me about it.

08:03.720 --> 08:05.711
So you're gonna see him again?

08:06.400 --> 08:10.109
Or should I say,
are you gonna see him Samoa?

08:12.840 --> 08:14.114
Oh, come on. That was funny.

08:14.280 --> 08:16.430
Oh, yeah. It's hilarious.

08:17.160 --> 08:19.071
You know what your problem is?

08:19.240 --> 08:22.676
- You don't drink enough.
- You're probably right.

08:22.840 --> 08:27.038
This is the first time today I've had a
chance to just sit down and decompress.

08:29.120 --> 08:31.429
- Cheers?
- Oh, cheers.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.073
Oh, that's good.

08:34.240 --> 08:36.958
I keep having this nagging feeling
that I forgot something.

08:37.159 --> 08:40.436
- Lf you forgot it, it wasn't important.
- Yeah, I guess.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.989
I can't believe you forgot me.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.430
I said I'm sorry.

08:59.600 --> 09:00.953
You forgot me.

09:01.120 --> 09:03.270
I know. I feel terrible.

09:03.440 --> 09:05.749
How many kids you got?

09:07.120 --> 09:09.588
- There's a towel on the floor, buddy.
- I'm okay.

09:10.080 --> 09:14.153
I want you to sit on it so you don't leave
a wet ass-print on my leather seats.

09:14.480 --> 09:15.799
You forgot me too.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.558
Yeah, but I'm just your uncle.

09:17.720 --> 09:19.073
He's your father.

09:19.280 --> 09:20.759
Yeah, my own father.

09:21.120 --> 09:22.394
Thanks, Charlie.

09:22.560 --> 09:24.391
Is there any way
I can make it up to you?

09:24.560 --> 09:27.472
- You wanna go out for a special dinner?
- No.

09:27.640 --> 09:29.153
- How about a movie?
- Why?

09:29.320 --> 09:30.833
You're gonna leave me there too?

09:32.120 --> 09:35.078
For the last time, I am sorry.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.157
Won't be the last time.

09:37.600 --> 09:39.670
I just wanna go home.
I'm cold and I'm wet.

09:39.880 --> 09:44.192
If you kick the back of my seat again,
you're gonna be colder and wetter.

09:45.240 --> 09:46.958
Ease up on him.
He's had a rough day.

09:47.160 --> 09:49.799
Yeah, my dad left me out in the rain.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.197
I'm sorry.

09:52.400 --> 09:53.879
What did I tell you?

09:56.360 --> 09:57.952
What's all this stuff on the floor?

09:58.120 --> 10:00.953
I don't know. Junk mail.
Parking tickets.

10:01.120 --> 10:03.714
- What's this?
- Satin blindfold.

10:05.040 --> 10:07.474
- For what?
- What do you mean, "For what"?

10:07.640 --> 10:08.914
In case I run into...

10:10.960 --> 10:12.393
...a piñata.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.070
- You're unbelievable.
- Don't judge.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.674
You felt up a Samoan dude.

10:20.080 --> 10:23.993
Hey, this is for me. From the IRS.

10:24.160 --> 10:26.674
It was mailed a month ago.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.235
Damn post office.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.391
Oh, perfect.

10:33.560 --> 10:36.358
- Just freaking perfect.
- Good news?

10:37.640 --> 10:39.312
I'm being audited.

10:39.480 --> 10:40.993
They wanna see me tomorrow.

10:41.360 --> 10:43.396
Oh, well, look at the upside.

10:43.760 --> 10:45.478
What upside?

10:46.840 --> 10:48.398
Yeah, okay, you got me.

10:49.280 --> 10:51.236
How could you forget
to give this to me?

10:51.800 --> 10:55.110
I don't know. How could you
forget your only son in the rain?

10:55.480 --> 10:57.789
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Watch the cleats.

11:03.720 --> 11:07.508
Let's go, sleepyhead.
Rise and shine, up and at 'em.

11:07.720 --> 11:11.508
Get out of my room
or I'll kill you with my bare hands.

11:11.720 --> 11:14.439
I'm being audited today.
You have to take Jake to school.

11:14.640 --> 11:16.392
Put him in a cab.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.597
Oh, please. I am counting on you.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.314
Then you're headed
for disappointment.

11:21.760 --> 11:24.558
You need to get Jake dressed,
make him his lunch...

11:24.720 --> 11:27.553
...and get him to school by 8, okay?
- Okay.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.630
- You're not moving.
- Yes, I am.

11:30.840 --> 11:32.876
I'm flipping you off under the covers.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.396
Get up!

11:39.160 --> 11:41.116
All right, I'm up.

11:41.520 --> 11:43.590
So you know what to do with Jake?

11:43.760 --> 11:46.228
You have to be responsible.
You have to be me today.

11:46.400 --> 11:49.517
- Think you can handle that?
- You left him out in the rain yesterday.

11:49.680 --> 11:51.511
It's not like you set the bar real high.

11:52.480 --> 11:53.879
- Charlie.
- Relax.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.315
I think I'm capable
of getting your kid to school.

11:56.480 --> 11:59.153
Good, because I really need your help.

11:59.920 --> 12:03.674
So... So I'm gonna leave now.

12:05.320 --> 12:07.197
You're all set, right?

12:07.400 --> 12:08.833
Charlie?

12:17.400 --> 12:19.868
Get up!

12:25.240 --> 12:26.992
Get dressed.
I'm taking you to school.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.635
I can't. I'm sick.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.310
Yeah, well, bite me.

12:33.040 --> 12:35.110
- Hey.
- Don't... Don't screw with me, shorty.

12:35.280 --> 12:37.555
I only got, like,
nine hours of sleep last night.

12:39.280 --> 12:42.192
- Now get dressed.
- I'm supposed to take a shower first.

12:45.760 --> 12:47.034
Sit near a window.

12:50.760 --> 12:54.070
- Here, put these on.
- I wore these yesterday.

12:54.280 --> 12:57.397
They're still extremely stylish.
Put them on.

12:58.400 --> 13:01.551
- Can I have some privacy, please?
- For what? You're 11.

13:01.760 --> 13:04.035
That's close to puberty.

13:04.960 --> 13:06.871
Okay, okay.

13:08.760 --> 13:10.034
I'm leaving.

13:15.320 --> 13:17.390
What am I, nuts?

13:28.960 --> 13:31.190
Get up!

13:33.920 --> 13:35.672
I could have dressed myself,
you know.

13:35.840 --> 13:38.070
You had your chance.

13:38.240 --> 13:40.276
I look stupid.

13:40.720 --> 13:43.518
Yeah, well, you're close to puberty.

13:43.720 --> 13:45.039
Oh, I forgot to comb my hair.

13:45.240 --> 13:47.879
No, no, no. I'll do it.

13:49.320 --> 13:50.719
That's spit.

13:50.920 --> 13:54.629
Hey, one man's saliva is another
man's mousse. Now shut up.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.157
There, you're beautiful. Let's go.

13:57.720 --> 14:00.234
- What about lunch?
- Sorry, I have plans.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.238
No, you're supposed to
make me lunch.

14:04.280 --> 14:06.475
Oh, all right, come on.

14:08.240 --> 14:10.913
You're not really a morning person,
are you?

14:11.080 --> 14:13.799
You're just saying that
because I spit on your head.

14:15.640 --> 14:18.359
- You like cold pizza, right?
- Sure.

14:24.360 --> 14:26.510
- This is frozen.
- Yeah. If you sit on it...

14:26.680 --> 14:28.636
...it'll thaw by lunch.

14:32.280 --> 14:34.874
My butt is freezing.

14:36.640 --> 14:37.914
You wanted pizza.

14:40.040 --> 14:41.917
All right, I'll put the seat warmer on.

14:42.080 --> 14:44.196
Cook it from both sides.

14:44.400 --> 14:47.995
- I like it better when my dad takes me.
- Oh, gee, you're not having fun?

14:48.160 --> 14:50.549
Because I'm farting rainbows
over here.

14:51.360 --> 14:53.954
First, he forgets me.
Now he leaves me with you.

14:54.400 --> 14:55.674
Hey, you know what?

14:55.840 --> 14:58.673
Your father works like a dog
to make sure you have everything.

14:59.160 --> 15:00.513
If he's not there for you...

15:00.680 --> 15:04.355
...it's just because he's trying
to stay out of federal prison.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.472
I think he needs to have sex.

15:11.080 --> 15:12.672
I was kidding about prison, Jake.

15:15.320 --> 15:17.038
What do you mean
he needs to have sex?

15:17.400 --> 15:19.118
Well, he's been really grumpy lately.

15:19.280 --> 15:22.352
You're usually in a good mood.
I figure it's because you have sex.

15:23.680 --> 15:27.514
Jake, it takes more than sex
to make a man happy.

15:28.640 --> 15:29.914
You also need money.

15:34.080 --> 15:35.718
All right, have a good day.

15:35.880 --> 15:38.314
- Learn something.
- This isn't my school.

15:39.240 --> 15:42.471
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I don't go to school here.

15:44.120 --> 15:46.031
Well, where do you go to school?

15:46.240 --> 15:48.037
Woodward Avenue Elementary.

15:48.240 --> 15:52.119
- And where the hell is that?
- Woodward Avenue, I guess.

15:53.480 --> 15:56.711
I don't know why you can't
tough it out here for one day.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.791
Make some new friends.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.839
Hey, Alan, it's Charlie.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.788
Look, I wanna ask you something but I
don't want you to read anything into it.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.877
Where exactly is Jake's school?

16:08.040 --> 16:10.315
<i>You don 't know where his school is?</i>

16:10.480 --> 16:12.311
<i>What the hell is wrong with you?</i>

16:12.480 --> 16:16.075
- <i>Are you trying to kill me?</i>
- You could be right about the sex thing.

16:18.840 --> 16:21.035
Okay, Woodward Avenue
Elementary School.

16:21.240 --> 16:22.639
Looks like they're closed.

16:22.800 --> 16:27.157
That's because I'm an hour late.
Even the crossing guard is gone.

16:29.120 --> 16:32.749
How about this? Why don't you just
bag school and we'll go catch a movie.

16:33.400 --> 16:36.392
- I can't skip school. I'm in the play.
- What play?

16:36.600 --> 16:38.955
The founding fathers' play.
You'll be there, right?

16:39.440 --> 16:41.590
Why would I be there?

16:41.880 --> 16:46.317
Because Mom's in Hawaii and Dad's got
that tax thing and you're all that's left.

16:47.480 --> 16:49.038
Oh, I'm all that's left.

16:49.240 --> 16:51.231
Hey, I'm not thrilled about it either.

16:52.800 --> 16:54.597
Okay. Where and when?

16:54.800 --> 16:56.677
In the auditorium after lunch.

16:56.880 --> 16:58.711
Oh, yeah. I need
a Ben Franklin costume.

16:59.360 --> 17:00.839
You're telling me this now?

17:01.040 --> 17:02.951
I told Mom but she's in Hawaii.

17:04.079 --> 17:05.798
All right.

17:06.079 --> 17:09.435
Let's see.
Washington, Jackson, Lincoln.

17:09.599 --> 17:11.829
Here we go. Benjamin Franklin.

17:12.319 --> 17:14.515
Why can't you be Lincoln?

17:14.839 --> 17:17.308
A beard, a mole, a top hat,
we're done.

17:17.520 --> 17:20.079
Because Lincoln
wasn't a founding father.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.676
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

17:23.880 --> 17:25.836
Now get out of here.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.279
Hey.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.677
You forgot your lunch.

17:33.840 --> 17:35.558
Hey.

17:41.480 --> 17:43.914
God, what a day.

17:44.080 --> 17:45.752
I don't wanna hear it.

17:45.920 --> 17:48.150
You know why I was being audited?

17:48.640 --> 17:52.792
Not because I have unsubstantiated
deductions. Which I have.

17:52.960 --> 17:55.838
Not because I take the occasional
cash payment from a client...

17:56.000 --> 17:58.560
...and forget to report it. Which I do.

17:58.720 --> 18:01.075
It was because no one at the IRS...

18:01.240 --> 18:05.597
...could believe I was paying
as much alimony as I claimed.

18:06.680 --> 18:09.478
It took me three hours
to convince them that, yes...

18:09.640 --> 18:12.154
...I am that big a schmuck.

18:12.960 --> 18:15.394
Oh, boo-hoo.

18:16.440 --> 18:18.590
You want a real fun time?

18:18.760 --> 18:21.274
Try finding an extra small
Ben Franklin costume...

18:21.440 --> 18:23.032
...at 9:00 in the morning.

18:23.760 --> 18:27.036
Oh, right. The play. How was it?

18:27.640 --> 18:30.200
Boffo. A smash.

18:31.320 --> 18:34.710
Among the highlights were a 12-year-old
Chinese George Washington...

18:34.880 --> 18:37.599
...with a powdered wig
and a snot bubble...

18:38.360 --> 18:40.794
...and your kid in a bald cap
and granny glasses...

18:40.960 --> 18:45.476
...holding a Tweety Bird kite and
announcing he's discovered elasticity.

18:46.160 --> 18:48.435
- Oh, I wish I'd seen it.
- Don't worry, you will.

18:48.600 --> 18:51.353
It was videotaped
from about 150 different angles.

18:51.680 --> 18:53.591
I should tell him
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.360
- Yeah, you should.
- Is he in his room?

19:24.920 --> 19:26.956
Here you go, pal. Your favorite.

19:27.120 --> 19:29.076
Bacon double cheeseburger
and cheese fries.

19:29.240 --> 19:32.312
And for dessert, I got fudge brownies
with that ice cream you like.

19:32.520 --> 19:34.750
Is this supposed to
make up for everything?

19:36.720 --> 19:38.517
- Yeah.
- Pretty much.

19:39.480 --> 19:42.313
Look, Jake, I know it's been rough
and I'm sorry.

19:42.520 --> 19:44.875
We're human, we make mistakes.
But I promise you...

19:45.040 --> 19:48.749
...neither of us will ever,
ever forget to pick you up again.

19:48.920 --> 19:51.309
Yeah, I still wanna go back to Mom's.

19:51.480 --> 19:54.199
When is she coming home
from Hawaii, anyway?

19:57.120 --> 19:58.872
Oh, crap.
