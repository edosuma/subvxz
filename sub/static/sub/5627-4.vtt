WEBVTT

00:14.170 --> 00:15.290
You're next.

00:22.620 --> 00:24.830
Meet 20-year-old Jose Rivera,

00:25.290 --> 00:28.290
night manager at a place
called Dee's Original Diner.

00:28.290 --> 00:30.290
And then this is Eddie Butler.

00:30.290 --> 00:32.080
He was 17. He was a fry cook,

00:32.460 --> 00:34.250
high school senior, basketball star.

00:44.460 --> 00:46.750
And finally Renee Acosta.

00:46.750 --> 00:49.920
She was 16 years old.
She was a cashier at the restaurant,

00:49.920 --> 00:52.750
and she was a junior in high school.

00:54.120 --> 00:55.670
- -

00:59.920 --> 01:03.920
And they were all murdered
last night just after closing.

01:03.920 --> 01:06.920
The safe and the cash
register were both emptied,

01:06.920 --> 01:08.790
and all the victims'
valuables were missing, too.

01:08.790 --> 01:10.380
Any surveillance video?

01:10.380 --> 01:12.420
No. Because the system
burnt down in a fire

01:12.420 --> 01:13.920
that was set after
the murders took place.

01:13.920 --> 01:16.460
The arson was probably
just a forensic countermeasure.

01:16.460 --> 01:17.620
-Look at me.
-

01:17.620 --> 01:18.880
The coroner has the bodies right now

01:18.880 --> 01:20.330
and it looks like
the cause of death to each

01:20.330 --> 01:21.830
was a gunshot wound to the head.

01:21.830 --> 01:23.250
Garcia, pause!

01:23.960 --> 01:25.040
Where did this happen?

01:25.380 --> 01:27.210
Oh, I was saving the worst for last.

01:27.210 --> 01:28.330
Las Vegas, New Mexico?

01:28.580 --> 01:29.620
Mmm-hmm.

01:31.250 --> 01:33.040
Wait, what's the deal with
Las Vegas, New Mexico?

01:33.040 --> 01:34.670
The same exact type
of robbery-homicide

01:34.670 --> 01:36.330
took place there six years ago.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.710
But that time it was at a place
called the Burger Corral

01:38.710 --> 01:39.920
and there were four victims.

01:39.920 --> 01:41.960
Teenagers.
They sexually assaulted the girls,

01:41.960 --> 01:43.960
then shot them execution style,
robbed the place,

01:43.960 --> 01:45.330
and then burned it down to the ground.

01:45.330 --> 01:48.210
We consulted from here
and the NCAVC coordinator

01:48.210 --> 01:49.580
in Santa Fe did the groundwork.

01:49.580 --> 01:50.880
Any suspects?

01:50.880 --> 01:52.460
None, but we knew it was
probably someone

01:52.460 --> 01:54.000
with a personal connection to the town.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.790
Problem was it's a pretty transient place.

01:55.790 --> 01:59.170
Tourists, truckers, and a lot of
the work opportunities are seasonal.

01:59.170 --> 02:00.920
Given the level of violence, we profiled

02:00.920 --> 02:03.000
it was two or more
criminally experienced UnSubs,

02:03.000 --> 02:05.750
most likely under
the influence of some type of narcotic,

02:05.750 --> 02:08.290
but they never struck again
and the case went cold.

02:08.290 --> 02:09.580
Looks like it's hot now.

02:09.580 --> 02:11.880
So are these guys back
or is this somebody playing copycat?

02:11.880 --> 02:13.040
That's what we need to find out.

02:13.040 --> 02:14.080
Wheels up in 30.

02:18.880 --> 02:19.920
Whoo!

03:15.710 --> 03:18.620
"All sins tend to be addictive.

03:18.620 --> 03:22.120
"And the terminal point
of addiction is damnation."

03:22.120 --> 03:23.880
W.H. Auden.

03:24.620 --> 03:26.880
Las Vegas, New Mexico,
was actually founded

03:26.880 --> 03:29.120
70 years before its Nevada counterpart.

03:29.120 --> 03:31.830
In the late 19th century,
it was a booming railroad hub

03:31.830 --> 03:33.290
with a reputation for lawlessness,

03:33.290 --> 03:36.250
and apparently, outlaws
are a part of the town's genetics.

03:36.250 --> 03:37.670
Billy the Kid lived there,

03:37.670 --> 03:39.170
and Doc Holliday himself
had a saloon there

03:39.170 --> 03:41.120
before going to meet
Wyatt Earp in Tombstone.

03:41.120 --> 03:43.830
The more things change,
the more things stay the same.

03:43.830 --> 03:47.290
All the victims in both instances
were teenagers, except for Jose Rivera.

03:47.290 --> 03:49.500
A younger staff,
that's pretty typical for a night shift.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.170
The UnSubs might have
considered that.

03:51.170 --> 03:53.710
It would be easier
to subdue a group of kids.

03:53.710 --> 03:55.830
Almost an identical MO.

03:55.830 --> 03:58.750
Copycat or no, why go back
to this town and do this again?

03:58.750 --> 04:01.120
They could be sending some kind of
message to announce their return.

04:01.120 --> 04:02.620
Or it just might be criminal ego.

04:02.620 --> 04:04.830
They got away with it the first time.
Why not do it again?

04:04.830 --> 04:06.120
With UnSubs this violent,

04:06.120 --> 04:08.330
how do you just disappear
and go dormant for six years?

04:08.330 --> 04:09.500
They may have been in prison.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.080
That would explain
the criminal experience.

04:11.080 --> 04:14.830
Crime U. Best education
taxpayer money can buy.

04:14.830 --> 04:17.040
When we land,
I'll have Garcia compile a list

04:17.040 --> 04:19.080
of recently released convicts
in the area.

04:19.080 --> 04:21.210
Morgan, you and Reid
go to the coroner when we land.

04:21.210 --> 04:23.250
Lewis, you're with Dave
and me at the local PD.

04:54.290 --> 04:56.000
That was a great day.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.460
Our girls had a ball.

04:59.750 --> 05:00.880
You didn't call me.

05:00.880 --> 05:02.460
You don't have to
come down here, you know.

05:02.460 --> 05:06.040
Word is there's a phone message.
Is it true?

05:06.040 --> 05:07.960
Brooks, there's nothing for you to do.

05:07.960 --> 05:09.330
Is it true, Raul?

05:10.710 --> 05:11.880
Yes.

05:16.710 --> 05:18.500
It's them, isn't it?

05:19.080 --> 05:21.170
Same ones as before.

05:22.420 --> 05:25.920
Brooks, you need to go home and wait
for me to call you with any news.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.710
It's worse at home and you know it.

05:27.710 --> 05:29.040
The feds are on their way.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.790
Behavioral specialists.

05:32.120 --> 05:34.040
Behavioral specialists.

05:34.710 --> 05:36.790
What the hell good's that gonna do,
huh?

05:38.710 --> 05:39.830
They're here.

05:44.500 --> 05:47.790
You know what? Come to think of it,
maybe you ought to stick around.

05:47.790 --> 05:48.920
They might want to talk with you.

05:50.460 --> 05:53.540
Agents, Chief Montoya at your service.
Thank you for coming.

05:54.080 --> 05:56.290
I'm Agent Hotchner.
This is Dr. Lewis and Agent Rossi.

05:56.290 --> 05:57.330
Nice to meet you.

05:57.710 --> 05:59.420
There's been a development.

05:59.420 --> 06:01.710
Renee Acosta's parents
discovered a voicemail

06:01.710 --> 06:04.250
she left when the assailants broke in.

06:04.250 --> 06:05.670
Over here.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.080
This is incredibly difficult,

06:09.080 --> 06:10.960
but anything you can tell us
about that call,

06:10.960 --> 06:13.080
anything at all, will be helpful.

06:14.380 --> 06:17.040
The message just showed up
this morning.

06:17.750 --> 06:19.540
Sometimes it does that.

06:21.080 --> 06:24.120
I didn't even hear my phone ring.

06:25.170 --> 06:27.540
Why did she call me?

06:27.540 --> 06:29.120
Why not the police?

06:29.120 --> 06:30.670
You're her mother,

06:31.460 --> 06:33.170
and she was frightened.

06:37.120 --> 06:40.460
I can't believe
it's been six years.

06:40.460 --> 06:42.920
It feels like yesterday.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.290
Fell asleep out on the couch.

06:45.540 --> 06:48.830
Next thing I know,
my wife's shaking me,

06:48.830 --> 06:51.040
yelling about how they killed Jenny.

06:52.460 --> 06:54.580
It all felt like a dream.

06:55.580 --> 07:00.120
I keep hoping
maybe I'll wake up one of these days.

07:00.830 --> 07:02.210
And where is your wife now?

07:02.710 --> 07:05.790
Went back to her family in Reno
about a year after it happened.

07:05.790 --> 07:07.500
Her heart was broken too bad.

07:07.500 --> 07:08.540
But you stayed.

07:09.670 --> 07:12.290
My daughter's buried right up the road.

07:12.620 --> 07:14.290
I ain't going anywhere.

07:15.620 --> 07:18.920
I thought for sure you'd have
caught 'em last time. I was positive.

07:18.920 --> 07:23.580
Mr. Tanner, we're going to do everything
we possibly can, I promise you.

07:23.580 --> 07:25.620
You just promise me

07:27.380 --> 07:29.670
you'll catch those sons of bitches

07:30.790 --> 07:32.290
and you're gonna make them pay.

07:33.960 --> 07:35.330
Oh, my God!

07:35.330 --> 07:38.380
Mom, they have guns.

07:40.040 --> 07:42.000
Get down!MAN 2: Shut your mouth!

07:42.000 --> 07:43.790
I got someone over here, partner.

07:55.420 --> 07:57.290
-You all right?
-

07:57.880 --> 07:59.880
Yeah. Yeah, just, um...

08:00.750 --> 08:04.080
Just listening to that voicemail again.

08:04.080 --> 08:07.830
With my work I've never been big on
the whole compartmentalization thing.

08:07.830 --> 08:09.750
I just feel like I can't
understand others' emotions

08:09.750 --> 08:11.710
if I don't deal with my own, you know?

08:11.710 --> 08:13.500
The best way out is always through.

08:14.290 --> 08:15.460
Too bad it's not always the easiest way.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.380
You're not kidding.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.880
You hear anything else
on the recording?

08:19.880 --> 08:22.170
Yeah. You guys profiled that you thought

08:22.170 --> 08:24.290
there might be multiple UnSubs.

08:24.290 --> 08:26.960
All right? I can only hear
two on this recording.

08:26.960 --> 08:29.960
So, unless there are others outside,

08:29.960 --> 08:31.580
we're dealing with a partnership.

08:32.290 --> 08:34.750
Several antemortem wounds,
facial lacerations,

08:34.750 --> 08:36.830
fractured jaw, a fractured skull.

08:36.830 --> 08:38.380
Yeah, it was a brutal beating.

08:38.380 --> 08:40.330
All three of them had broken ribs, too.

08:40.330 --> 08:41.620
And ligature marks.

08:41.620 --> 08:44.880
Looks like the boys were bound
with their own belts and electrical wires.

08:44.880 --> 08:48.040
I found leather
and melted plastic in their clothes.

08:48.040 --> 08:49.710
Renee Acosta was different.

08:49.710 --> 08:52.040
There's evidence of sexual assault.

08:53.330 --> 08:55.250
Any recoverable DNA?

08:55.250 --> 08:57.040
None. Whatever wasn't
destroyed by the fire

08:57.040 --> 08:58.710
got washed away by the sprinklers.

08:58.710 --> 09:00.620
But she was recovered
without clothes on.

09:00.620 --> 09:03.920
And based on the cotton and nylon
fibers I found around her wrists,

09:03.920 --> 09:05.880
I think they restrained her
with her own underwear.

09:06.960 --> 09:09.330
That's precisely what happened
to the female victims six years ago.

09:09.330 --> 09:10.880
Those details weren't
released to the press.

09:10.880 --> 09:13.750
These aren't copycats.
These are the same guys.

09:17.120 --> 09:18.460
Whoo!

09:19.920 --> 09:21.080
Want a bump, man?

09:21.080 --> 09:22.540
No, man, I'm good for now.

09:23.960 --> 09:25.080
Suit yourself.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.330
Gracias, amigo,pleasure doing business with you.

09:35.250 --> 09:36.580
Yes, sir.

09:36.580 --> 09:39.830
Get myself a big old hooker tonight
and have a little fun with her.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.040
Where you goin'?

09:43.580 --> 09:45.040
There's somebody I ain't seen
in a while.

09:45.040 --> 09:46.380
Oh, you gotta
be kidding me, man.

09:46.380 --> 09:49.040
What's a few hours?
Tell her to wait. You'll miss all the fun.

09:49.040 --> 09:51.330
No, man, I'm good.

09:51.960 --> 09:53.170
I'll meet you back here later.

09:54.290 --> 09:56.710
Aw, come on, Duke.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.580
Come on, man, we need
to score some more crank.

10:06.960 --> 10:09.210
Cole, honey, don't just eat your chips.

10:09.210 --> 10:11.830
I want to see you eat your sandwich.
Okay?

11:03.250 --> 11:04.420
When did you get out?

11:04.420 --> 11:05.960
Lovely to see you, too.

11:05.960 --> 11:07.540
You can't come in here.

11:07.540 --> 11:08.920
I got you flowers.

11:08.920 --> 11:10.460
You picked them from my yard.

11:10.460 --> 11:12.460
What's the matter, huh?
You love flowers.

11:12.790 --> 11:14.000
Go, please.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.500
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.790
Where's the fire, huh?

11:17.330 --> 11:19.460
What, you, uh...
You ain't happy to see me?

11:19.460 --> 11:20.880
Do I look happy to see you, Duke?

11:20.880 --> 11:23.580
You know, I wrote you letters.
I tried to call.

11:23.580 --> 11:27.080
Hell, you're... You are the only reason
I came back to this damn place.

11:27.080 --> 11:28.710
-You shouldn't have bothered.
-Hey!

11:28.710 --> 11:31.420
Not a day went by
that I didn't think about you.

11:32.330 --> 11:35.080
You saying you didn't miss me

11:35.080 --> 11:36.540
Not a bit.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.540
Mommy, who are you talking to?

11:39.540 --> 11:41.580
Nobody, baby.
Go on and finish your lunch.

11:41.580 --> 11:43.460
"Mommy"

11:43.460 --> 11:46.000
Get out of here, Duke. I'm serious.

11:49.540 --> 11:50.670
Wait a minute.

11:50.670 --> 11:52.250
-Don't ever come back.
-How old is he?

11:52.250 --> 11:53.670
Hey, kid! How old are you?

11:53.670 --> 11:54.880
Cole, I said go into the living room!

11:54.880 --> 11:56.540
-What is he, about five?
-I have a shotgun in here.

11:56.540 --> 11:58.080
You know I'll use it.

11:58.080 --> 11:59.540
-He's mine, isn't he?
-Goodbye.

11:59.540 --> 12:00.790
Tam, is that my son?

12:01.620 --> 12:02.960
-Is that my son?
-Get out of here!

12:02.960 --> 12:05.040
I'm gonna call the cops!

12:14.960 --> 12:17.920
Six years ago the UnSubs
separated the victims by gender.

12:17.920 --> 12:20.250
The bodies of the boys
were found out by the register,

12:20.250 --> 12:22.460
the two girls were found
in the back office.

12:22.460 --> 12:24.040
Yeah, we profiled
that was about control.

12:24.040 --> 12:25.790
Isolate the males
who were more of a threat.

12:25.790 --> 12:27.620
Exactly. They even blindfolded them.

12:27.620 --> 12:29.210
But they didn't do that this time.

12:29.210 --> 12:32.250
No blindfolds, and the three victims
were found in the same area,

12:32.250 --> 12:33.710
all within a few feet of each other.

12:33.710 --> 12:36.750
Dee's Original Diner had a back office.
Why didn't they use it?

12:36.750 --> 12:38.330
And look at the body position.

12:38.330 --> 12:40.080
The victims from six years ago
were prone,

12:40.080 --> 12:41.880
like they were shot while kneeling.

12:41.880 --> 12:44.120
But Jose Rivera and Eddie Butler
were both sitting up.

12:44.580 --> 12:46.290
Maybe they posed them that way.

12:46.290 --> 12:49.670
I don't think so. Ballistics suggest
they were seated when they were shot,

12:49.920 --> 12:51.080
and look at the way they're facing.

12:51.080 --> 12:52.960
It's like they wanted them
to see each other.

12:52.960 --> 12:54.580
Not see. Watch.

12:54.580 --> 12:56.750
You think they made
the boys watch the sexual assault?

12:56.750 --> 12:58.960
Well, if they did, they probably made
her watch the murders.

12:59.580 --> 13:01.040
Psychological sadism.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.830
A ritual aspect. That's new.

13:02.830 --> 13:06.620
And very specific.
Why didn't they do this before?

13:06.620 --> 13:08.120
Well, they could be evolving.

13:08.120 --> 13:11.960
Or it's possible only one of them
was involved six years ago.

13:11.960 --> 13:14.540
Which would mean
he has a new partner.

13:18.750 --> 13:19.880
It's slow.

13:20.540 --> 13:22.790
You know, we ought to knock off early.

13:22.790 --> 13:24.420
- -

13:24.420 --> 13:25.960
Spoke too soon.

13:26.290 --> 13:27.750
-Hi, how can I...
-

13:28.420 --> 13:29.830
Evening, folks.

13:30.080 --> 13:31.330
I'm gonna need you to fill a prescription.

14:25.330 --> 14:27.170
-All right, ladies and gentlemen...
-

14:27.170 --> 14:28.500
We're gonna have a little fun now.

14:28.500 --> 14:31.710
You come with me.
Come on. Let go of her. Let go.

14:39.040 --> 14:42.000
Randy McAdams, his niece Jane.

14:43.210 --> 14:45.000
My wife's friends with her mother.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.920
The press is outside.
Do you want us to handle this?

14:48.710 --> 14:50.580
No, I'll... I'll do it.

14:56.210 --> 14:58.710
He's looking for
methamphetamine hydrochloride.

14:59.250 --> 15:01.540
He cleaned out the cash register, too.

15:02.120 --> 15:04.620
There was only one of them.
Where's the partner?

15:05.040 --> 15:09.040
It's a huge risk to stay in town
and pull this so soon.

15:09.040 --> 15:11.920
They're meth addicts, though.
The risk may be of little consequence.

15:11.920 --> 15:14.040
Six years ago they up and disappeared.

15:14.500 --> 15:16.250
This one doesn't seem
like part of their playbook.

15:16.670 --> 15:18.620
My money says it's the new guy.

15:18.620 --> 15:21.290
He was smart enough to hide his face
and he didn't burn the place down.

15:21.290 --> 15:23.460
We still have to wait
for the autopsy, but,

15:23.460 --> 15:24.790
she's fully clothed.

15:24.790 --> 15:26.620
Doesn't look like there was
sexual assault either.

15:26.620 --> 15:28.880
But he still made them watch. Look.

15:28.880 --> 15:31.170
He positions them
so they're facing each other.

15:31.170 --> 15:34.580
That aspect is important to him,
almost compulsive.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.500
You think he's okay?

15:49.080 --> 15:50.920
No. I don't.

15:50.920 --> 15:56.000
His job is to keep this community safe,
and now he feels responsible.

16:19.460 --> 16:21.330
Ho-ho-ho, you missed it, brother.

16:21.330 --> 16:22.460
Where you been?

16:22.460 --> 16:23.960
I was out like I told you, man.

16:23.960 --> 16:25.460
I want a beer. You want a beer?

16:25.460 --> 16:27.290
You go and do
something stupid, Lester?

16:27.290 --> 16:29.330
No beer, man? This place is a dump.

16:29.330 --> 16:32.540
All them sirens I been hearing out there,
they better not be because of you.

16:32.540 --> 16:35.330
Relax, man. Cops got no idea it was me.

16:35.580 --> 16:37.830
I rode by a bunch of them
on the way back over here.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.290
What the hell did you do, man?

16:39.290 --> 16:41.540
I scored us some
primo pharmacy grade.

16:42.040 --> 16:44.170
-That's what.
-Damn it, Les, we're supposed to...

16:44.170 --> 16:45.540
What about, "Thank you, Les"?

16:45.540 --> 16:47.540
"That was very thoughtful of you, Les"?

16:47.540 --> 16:49.380
No problem, man. Don't sweat it.

16:49.380 --> 16:52.710
How about, "We were supposed
to be laying low, Les." How about...

16:52.710 --> 16:54.960
Who the hell died
and made you the boss, man?

16:54.960 --> 16:57.880
As I remember,
you were out making a booty call.

16:57.880 --> 17:00.000
Hey! She ain't got
nothing to do with this.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.500
The hell she don't.

17:01.500 --> 17:03.790
What am I supposed to do,
sit around and wait

17:03.790 --> 17:05.920
until you get your rocks off, man?

17:05.920 --> 17:07.580
Get the pills. We got to go.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.170
I ain't done talking about this.

17:11.170 --> 17:12.460
Well, I am.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.170
Hey, cute stuff,
you got something good for me?

17:21.170 --> 17:24.960
I am happy to report that I have
finished my nationwide ViCAP search

17:24.960 --> 17:26.670
of criminals who like to
make their victims

17:26.670 --> 17:28.380
watch them commit violent crimes.

17:28.380 --> 17:31.500
I'm sad to tell you
it is an appallingly populated genre.

17:31.500 --> 17:33.830
I got a whole lot of bad boys
and it's not even Saturday night.

17:33.830 --> 17:35.380
Well, narrow it down by
surrounding states.

17:35.380 --> 17:37.040
The UnSubs are probably
from somewhere in the region.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.380
And eliminate anybody
over the age of 45.

17:39.380 --> 17:40.960
These crimes are impulsive and violent.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.210
They're probably not that old.

17:42.210 --> 17:43.500
Copy you.

17:43.500 --> 17:46.120
That brings us down to four.

17:46.120 --> 17:49.790
Ooh. Wait. Rewind. Actually two.
'Cause two of those guys have died.

17:49.790 --> 17:50.920
What's that leave us?

17:51.210 --> 17:56.080
Uh, first up is 41-year-old Glen
Capshaw from Yuma, Arizona.

17:56.080 --> 17:59.920
He made his 9-year-old son
watch him beat up a bully's father.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.250
Apparently made
the 10-year-old bully watch, too.

18:02.250 --> 18:05.210
Which is mean,
but weirdly fair, maybe?

18:05.210 --> 18:07.250
He doesn't fit our profile. Who else?

18:07.250 --> 18:11.420
Okay, next up is 26-year-old
Lester Turner from Lubbock, Texas.

18:11.790 --> 18:14.670
When he was 16,
he raped a 15-year-old girl,

18:14.670 --> 18:17.120
made her 12-year-old brother watch.

18:17.380 --> 18:19.380
Beat up the brother really bad, too.

18:19.380 --> 18:22.330
Well, that would explain the ritual
aspect. What else you got on this guy?

18:22.330 --> 18:24.790
Uh, he served nine years,
two of them in juvie,

18:24.790 --> 18:27.040
the rest of them at Texas State Prison,

18:27.040 --> 18:28.580
which is owned by
the Citadel Corrections Company.

18:28.580 --> 18:29.960
He was released last year.

18:29.960 --> 18:32.170
So he was actually locked up
during the Burger Corral incident.

18:32.170 --> 18:34.210
They may have met in prison.
He could be his new partner.

18:34.210 --> 18:36.000
Garcia, give me everything
you've got on Turner,

18:36.000 --> 18:37.790
known associates, cell mates,
the whole nine.

18:37.790 --> 18:39.170
On it. Stand by, sugar love.

18:39.580 --> 18:42.170
A town this small, these guys
have got to be feeling the heat.

18:42.170 --> 18:43.540
They'll be on the move soon.

18:58.120 --> 19:00.000
Hey. What you got cooking, baby girl?

19:00.000 --> 19:03.290
Besides the fact that I'm all hopped up
on dark roast and espresso beans?

19:03.290 --> 19:05.790
I have intel to share.
'Tis why I have called thee.

19:05.790 --> 19:07.830
Deep background search
into Lester Turner

19:07.830 --> 19:09.420
brought me down into a wicked place.

19:09.420 --> 19:13.330
Turned out he shared a cell block
with a Benjamin Wade

19:13.330 --> 19:14.620
and a William Duke Mason.

19:14.620 --> 19:16.000
-What's so...
-

19:16.000 --> 19:18.040
You know better than to interrupt me
when I'm all 'feined out.

19:18.040 --> 19:19.830
You're gonna ask me
what is so sinisterly special

19:19.830 --> 19:21.790
about Wade and Mason,
and I'm going to tell you.

19:21.790 --> 19:24.420
They were meth'd out bikers,
who, five years ago

19:24.420 --> 19:27.790
were arrested in El Paso
for an armed robbery at a gas station

19:27.790 --> 19:29.000
where the clerk was killed.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.540
It turns out they tried to
torch the place,

19:30.540 --> 19:32.000
but the cops came and caught them.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.170
All right, can you send...

19:33.170 --> 19:34.670
Stop it. Check your tablets.
It's already there.

19:34.670 --> 19:36.210
Can I ask a question now?

19:36.210 --> 19:38.120
Definitely not,
because that's not the kicker.

19:38.120 --> 19:41.000
Get this. Before he dropped out
of high school and ran away,

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
William Duke Mason spent his junior
year in what New Mexico town?

19:44.000 --> 19:45.080
Yes, you may talk now.

19:45.540 --> 19:46.670
Las Vegas.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.710
Precisely! See, Mason's name
was on that list of ex-cons,

19:49.710 --> 19:51.460
but it wasn't flagged
because he's actually from Dallas,

19:51.460 --> 19:54.040
and high school records weren't part of
my search parameters, you guys.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.880
Garcia, where are Wade
and Mason now?

19:56.880 --> 19:58.290
Oh, I can tell you that definitely.

19:58.290 --> 20:00.750
Wade is still in prison
because he was the shooter

20:00.750 --> 20:03.750
in that robbery,
but Mason was paroled last month.

20:04.960 --> 20:07.580
Lewis and I will fly
to Texas and talk to Wade.

20:07.580 --> 20:09.330
Let's put out an APB
on Turner and Mason.

20:09.750 --> 20:13.120
William Duke Mason's mother Violet
moved here from Dallas

20:13.460 --> 20:16.920
after she married a rancher
named Jeff Koldyke,

20:16.920 --> 20:19.750
who worked for the Romero property
for a short time.

20:19.750 --> 20:21.040
Don't remember any of them.

20:21.040 --> 20:22.830
It's not surprising
you don't remember Mason.

20:22.830 --> 20:25.210
As a teenager,
he would have been withdrawn.

20:25.210 --> 20:28.080
Especially because
we think he hated it here.

20:28.080 --> 20:29.920
He was already fatherless,

20:29.920 --> 20:32.620
and then he was uprooted
and dragged to a new place

20:32.620 --> 20:33.920
where he had no friends.

20:33.920 --> 20:35.500
As a teenager, that can be traumatic

20:35.500 --> 20:38.420
and may somehow be a source of
animosity towards the town itself.

20:39.120 --> 20:40.380
Who... Who's that guy?

20:40.380 --> 20:41.750
His name is Ben Wade.

20:41.750 --> 20:43.120
We actually have reason to believe

20:43.120 --> 20:46.330
that he was involved in
the Burger Corral murder six years ago.

20:46.330 --> 20:49.540
Five years ago, Wade and Mason
were arrested in Texas.

20:49.540 --> 20:52.420
So we know
they were partners back then.

20:52.420 --> 20:54.670
Then in prison they met Lester Turner.

20:54.670 --> 20:57.500
Turner gets released
and a few months later Mason gets out.

20:57.500 --> 20:58.830
A partnership is born.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.880
A lot of criminal ego in play.

21:01.880 --> 21:04.080
So we think they
may have come back here

21:04.080 --> 21:07.460
in order to emulate the success
they had with their old partnership.

21:07.460 --> 21:10.080
They're methamphetamine users,
so it's likely

21:10.080 --> 21:12.330
the limbic systems in their brains
have been damaged.

21:12.330 --> 21:15.710
This is disconcerting, because it can
dramatically alter behavior

21:15.710 --> 21:18.460
and give rise to a series
of psychopathic tendencies

21:18.460 --> 21:20.920
and eventually turn into
full-blown psychosis.

21:20.920 --> 21:23.380
The dynamic between
Turner and Mason is rare,

21:23.380 --> 21:25.620
like two alpha males co-existing.

21:26.500 --> 21:27.540
Hey!

21:27.790 --> 21:29.170
I'm running low!

21:29.170 --> 21:31.460
They must have some
kind of respect and/or fear thing

21:31.460 --> 21:32.880
that's keeping them together.

21:32.880 --> 21:34.380
But it's a tenuous bond.

21:34.380 --> 21:36.580
A rift will grow
between these two

21:36.580 --> 21:39.290
if it hasn't already.
In fact, we're counting on it.

21:39.620 --> 21:42.250
Hopefully, they'll make a mistake.

21:42.750 --> 21:43.830
Thank you.

21:44.170 --> 21:46.000
All right. Let's get to it.

21:46.380 --> 21:47.670
Definitely.

21:50.420 --> 21:52.500
-Damn it.
-

21:52.500 --> 21:53.540
Damn it.

21:54.710 --> 21:56.290
Excuse me.

22:11.620 --> 22:13.710
How's the coffee around here?

22:14.330 --> 22:16.210
It ain't Starbucks.

22:16.210 --> 22:18.250
Well, that's not necessarily a bad thing.

22:18.250 --> 22:20.210
Me, I'm Italian. I like it strong.

22:20.210 --> 22:21.460
How about you?

22:21.710 --> 22:22.880
Hot and fresh.

22:22.880 --> 22:24.460
Really?

22:24.460 --> 22:28.540
'Cause I, uh, kind of pegged you
as a single malt kind of guy.

22:30.380 --> 22:34.120
Look, Chief, we both know
that if your judgement is compromised,

22:34.120 --> 22:37.420
it doesn't do us any good.
In fact, quite the opposite.

22:38.210 --> 22:40.420
The last thing your town needs

22:40.420 --> 22:43.920
is for its Chief of Police
to be caught drinking on the job.

22:44.880 --> 22:48.620
Now, I know you've buried
a lot of good people,

22:48.620 --> 22:50.710
people you're supposed to protect.

22:50.710 --> 22:54.830
But the ones who are still here
need you now more than ever.

22:54.830 --> 22:55.920
So...

22:57.380 --> 23:01.710
Why don't you go home,
drink some real coffee, and dry out.

23:03.120 --> 23:04.880
You come back fresh,

23:05.710 --> 23:07.540
you can help us catch these guys.

23:16.250 --> 23:18.250
Nixon State Penitentiary
EL PASO, TEXAS

23:18.250 --> 23:20.080
- -

23:20.710 --> 23:23.580
You sure are some kind
of tall drink of water, ain't you?

23:23.580 --> 23:25.540
I usually don't even like your kind.

23:25.540 --> 23:26.790
Shut up.

23:29.210 --> 23:31.790
We want to ask you about your partner,
William Duke Mason,

23:31.790 --> 23:33.290
and this man, Lester Turner.

23:33.290 --> 23:36.420
Six years ago a restaurant
in Las Vegas, New Mexico, was robbed.

23:36.420 --> 23:37.830
There's another Vegas?

23:38.620 --> 23:40.250
They got gambling
and hookers out there, too?

23:40.250 --> 23:41.790
The entire staff was killed

23:41.790 --> 23:43.790
and the restaurant
was burned to the ground.

23:43.790 --> 23:46.120
Not before they raped the girls, though.

23:46.120 --> 23:48.290
They were teenagers, all four of them.

23:48.290 --> 23:49.670
Well, ain't that just tragic.

23:49.670 --> 23:50.960
We know it was you, Ben.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.170
Y'all can't prove that.

23:54.170 --> 23:55.500
Not yet. As soon as we do,

23:55.500 --> 23:57.960
we'll make sure you're prosecuted
to the fullest extent of the law.

23:58.420 --> 24:00.750
And what that means is that
after you finish

24:00.750 --> 24:03.290
serving out your remaining
20 years here,

24:03.290 --> 24:05.290
you'll be transferred to New Mexico.

24:05.290 --> 24:08.540
Now, the good news is
they've outlawed the death penalty,

24:08.540 --> 24:12.420
but the bad news is,
it's gonna be a slow death in a cage.

24:13.080 --> 24:15.250
But we may be able
to convince the court to be lenient

24:15.250 --> 24:16.750
if you cooperate with us.

24:17.880 --> 24:20.080
Must have made you mad,
losing your partner like that.

24:20.080 --> 24:22.080
Stuck in here all by yourself.

24:22.330 --> 24:24.960
The two of them out there, together,

24:24.960 --> 24:27.790
raising the kind of hell
you can only dream about.

24:28.120 --> 24:30.380
But you can help us catch the men.

24:30.380 --> 24:33.290
Maybe knock a couple years off
your sentence while you're at it.

24:33.290 --> 24:37.380
Who knows? Maybe you'll get a
chance to ride a Harley again

24:37.380 --> 24:39.000
before you need a walker.

24:44.750 --> 24:46.040
All right.

24:46.830 --> 24:48.040
What do y'all want to know?

24:48.040 --> 24:50.000
We want to know
about their relationship.

24:50.830 --> 24:53.620
Thick as thieves, both of them.

24:53.620 --> 24:55.830
Kind of weird, too,
'cause Lester's stone cold crazy.

24:56.830 --> 24:59.170
-But he's a loyal little son of a bitch.
-How so?

24:59.170 --> 25:01.750
Well, one day Duke knocked out
this big-ass Mexican

25:01.750 --> 25:03.250
who was trying to shank Lester.

25:03.250 --> 25:05.540
Ever since then, they was inseparable.

25:05.540 --> 25:09.210
They'd tweak together,
share food, cigarettes.

25:09.210 --> 25:10.710
I'd always hear them talk
about how they was gonna

25:10.710 --> 25:12.250
open up a motorcycle shop someday.

25:12.250 --> 25:14.170
Tell you the truth, I think Lester's

25:14.170 --> 25:16.170
a little sweet on him,
if you know what I mean.

25:16.170 --> 25:18.500
And what's so
stone cold crazy about him?

25:18.500 --> 25:20.040
I'll put it this way, darling,

25:20.040 --> 25:22.040
if you happen to find him,
you ain't taking him alive.

25:22.420 --> 25:25.040
And he sure as hell isn't gonna
let you hurt his boy Duke.

25:48.500 --> 25:49.580
Hi, chief.

25:50.580 --> 25:53.500
I'll take these, and I'm gonna need
a fill-up on one and three.

25:54.670 --> 25:55.960
Okay.

25:57.250 --> 25:59.040
- -Whoa.

25:59.040 --> 26:00.330
Saw you on the news, mister.

26:00.580 --> 26:02.750
-Okay, calm down, amigo.-I'm calling the cops.

26:02.750 --> 26:05.880
It's okay. You don't want to do this, man.

26:05.880 --> 26:07.170
- -Afternoon, sir.

26:08.380 --> 26:10.920
Can't say I appreciate you pulling
that gun on my friend.

26:11.790 --> 26:13.830
Whoo! Lord have mercy!

26:13.830 --> 26:15.790
Clean out the register.
I got the cameras.

26:15.790 --> 26:17.580
Get lighter fluid
so we can torch this place.

26:17.580 --> 26:20.710
No time. The cops know who we are.
Got to keep moving.

26:20.710 --> 26:21.750
Whoo!

26:31.580 --> 26:33.620
Ah, here we go.

27:18.750 --> 27:20.620
Thank you so much. Thank you, man,
you've been so helpful.

27:20.620 --> 27:22.670
Can I get a high five? Yeah!

27:27.420 --> 27:29.380
All the surveillance has been destroyed.

27:29.380 --> 27:30.540
What'd the father say?

27:30.540 --> 27:32.460
There were two of them.
Both on motorcycles,

27:32.460 --> 27:34.580
both matching the descriptions
of Turner and Mason.

27:34.580 --> 27:36.330
They let them live. I wonder why.

27:36.330 --> 27:37.790
They said the one with the short hair

27:37.790 --> 27:40.080
just stood there pointing his weapon
but never pulled the trigger.

27:40.080 --> 27:41.290
That must have been Mason.

27:41.290 --> 27:43.000
Apparently the other one
wanted to shoot them,

27:43.000 --> 27:46.040
Mason wouldn't let him,
they had a brief argument and then fled.

27:46.040 --> 27:48.960
But here's the thing,
they've never left a survivor before.

27:48.960 --> 27:51.460
I think something between them
must have changed.

27:51.460 --> 27:53.670
If they were arguing, it could mean
the partnership's dissolving,

27:53.670 --> 27:54.830
exactly like we thought.

27:54.830 --> 27:57.040
These guys are headed south,
maybe Mexico.

27:57.040 --> 27:58.580
We should alert border patrol.

28:16.880 --> 28:18.040
We should keep moving.

28:18.040 --> 28:19.330
We've been moving, man.

28:19.330 --> 28:20.710
What the hell was that back there?

28:20.710 --> 28:22.210
I told you, I ain't killing kids.

28:22.210 --> 28:24.120
That's wasn't a kid, man.
That was a witness.

28:24.120 --> 28:26.210
He wasn't more than six years old.

28:26.210 --> 28:27.920
What about his daddy, huh?

28:27.920 --> 28:29.000
No.

28:29.620 --> 28:31.880
-Why not?
-Because a boy needs his father.

28:31.880 --> 28:33.170
Oh...

28:33.170 --> 28:34.880
So now you got a conscience.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.250
Ain't that something.

28:36.250 --> 28:38.620
Got any other new developments
you want to let me in on?

28:39.960 --> 28:41.710
-Yeah.
-Huh?

28:41.710 --> 28:43.420
Yeah, I think it's about time we split up.

28:43.710 --> 28:45.920
Split up?

28:48.330 --> 28:49.580
Are you serious?

28:49.580 --> 28:51.000
Just got different priorities now.

28:51.420 --> 28:54.120
What the hell happened to Mexico,
and the bike shop, man?

28:54.120 --> 28:55.710
Cervezas and seÃ±oritas.

28:55.710 --> 28:56.920
Things change, brother.

28:56.920 --> 28:58.920
We've been talking about this for years,

28:58.920 --> 29:00.830
and now you're just gonna
bail on me for some bitch?

29:02.170 --> 29:03.710
Don't call her that.

29:04.290 --> 29:05.830
That's the mother of my son.

29:08.210 --> 29:11.420
So now what, you just gonna run
off and live happily ever after

29:11.420 --> 29:13.080
like some fairy tale?

29:14.250 --> 29:16.540
You're a grade-A fugitive, my man.

29:16.540 --> 29:18.540
That may prove difficult.

29:18.540 --> 29:22.670
Well, I ain't running out on my kid so
she can go drag him from town to town.

29:22.670 --> 29:24.000
How do you know he's yours?

29:24.000 --> 29:25.170
He's mine.

29:25.170 --> 29:28.120
Yeah? Your ass has been locked up.

29:28.710 --> 29:31.040
That whore could've banged
any cowboy or...

29:31.040 --> 29:32.210
Watch your mouth.

29:32.210 --> 29:34.750
That bitch could've wrapped her legs
around just about anybody.

29:36.500 --> 29:38.620
Hey, you're an idiot, man.

29:38.920 --> 29:41.170
You go back there,
it's gonna be crawling with cops.

29:41.880 --> 29:42.960
Oh, come on!

29:49.710 --> 29:51.330
Duke!

29:53.540 --> 29:54.710
Agents.

29:54.710 --> 29:56.500
Chief, you're back.

29:56.500 --> 29:58.670
I made some phone calls.

29:58.670 --> 30:02.580
One of my guys knows a girl who went
to high school with Duke Mason.

30:02.580 --> 30:05.500
She said he used to date
a girl named Tammy Vasquez.

30:05.500 --> 30:09.250
Even after they graduated,
I guess he still would come around.

30:09.540 --> 30:11.380
Anyway, the rumor is
he got her pregnant.

30:11.380 --> 30:12.750
Is she still here?

30:12.750 --> 30:15.830
She sure is. Lives just outside of town.

30:16.120 --> 30:17.920
- -

30:17.920 --> 30:19.420
Ready and willing.
What can I do you for?

30:19.420 --> 30:22.250
Garcia, tell me everything you
can about a Tammy Vasquez.

30:22.500 --> 30:24.170
She's from here in Las Vegas.

30:24.170 --> 30:26.710
-Um, Tammy May Vasquez.
-

30:26.710 --> 30:30.750
She is a waitress at the Spic and Span
Diner in New Mexico.

30:30.750 --> 30:33.380
She has a 5-year-old son named Cole.
He's a cutie.

30:33.380 --> 30:36.420
So she must have gotten pregnant
right around that first set of murders.

30:36.710 --> 30:38.750
What can you tell us
about Cole's father?

30:38.750 --> 30:41.210
Absolutely nothing. It says "father
unknown" on the birth certificate.

30:42.920 --> 30:44.880
What if Tammy is the reason
Mason came back?

30:44.880 --> 30:46.460
Send us an address, Penelope.
We should talk to her.

30:46.460 --> 30:47.750
Sent.

30:47.750 --> 30:49.960
I can get you up there quick
if you don't mind an escort.

30:49.960 --> 30:51.460
Yeah. We should tell Hotch.

30:52.670 --> 30:53.960
Agent Rossi.

30:56.580 --> 31:00.920
I, uh, I thought about what you said
and did what you suggested.

31:01.750 --> 31:03.500
Had some real coffee.

31:04.790 --> 31:05.830
I'm good to go.

31:06.120 --> 31:07.620
You sure about that?

31:07.620 --> 31:08.960
You have my word.

31:30.790 --> 31:32.330
Here comes the T. rex...

31:32.330 --> 31:34.080
I'm gonna have a sleep.

31:34.380 --> 31:36.920
You're gonna have a sleep

31:36.920 --> 31:38.500
With a sleep pistol.

31:38.500 --> 31:42.670
A sleep pistol? I'm gonna break it all
down here.

31:42.670 --> 31:43.880
Hey, Tam.

31:43.880 --> 31:45.040
Hi, Mommy.

31:45.040 --> 31:47.170
Hey. What's this guy's name right here?

31:47.170 --> 31:48.420
He's a triceratops.

31:48.420 --> 31:49.710
-A triceratops.
-I'm sorry.

31:49.710 --> 31:51.250
Isn't that cool.

31:51.250 --> 31:52.580
Cole, baby, come here. Come to Mama.

31:52.580 --> 31:54.880
Oh, wait a minute.

31:54.880 --> 31:57.460
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute, now.

31:58.120 --> 31:59.420
Tam, come on.

31:59.420 --> 32:01.290
-I'm calling the cops.
-Tam! Tam.

32:02.250 --> 32:03.830
Now, we're playing here.

32:05.080 --> 32:06.250
Can't you see that?

32:09.790 --> 32:12.920
Why don't you come in here
and sit on down a minute.

32:14.250 --> 32:17.710
There you go. Look at us.

32:17.710 --> 32:20.920
One big happy family
just playing dinosaurs and Legos.

32:22.380 --> 32:24.210
I'm gonna make it up to you, Tam.

32:25.330 --> 32:26.710
I swear it.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.580
Cole, which is the toughest dinosaur?

32:29.580 --> 32:30.750
-The T. rex.
-

32:30.750 --> 32:32.670
A T. rex! That's right!

32:32.670 --> 32:35.120
I'm gonna eat this guy!

32:35.120 --> 32:36.540
I'm gonna tear his meat
right off his back.

32:57.170 --> 32:58.540
Ms. Vasquez! Police!

32:59.380 --> 33:00.830
Hello?

33:01.080 --> 33:02.540
Anybody home?

33:04.710 --> 33:06.120
Nobody here.

33:08.830 --> 33:10.040
Wait a minute.

33:14.210 --> 33:15.380
You hear that?

33:22.540 --> 33:24.790
FBI! Anybody here?

33:27.380 --> 33:28.420
There's somebody in there.

33:28.830 --> 33:30.170
Go around.

33:41.880 --> 33:43.000
Guys.

33:44.960 --> 33:47.250
It's okay. It's okay, I got you.

33:47.500 --> 33:48.580
I got you.

33:51.540 --> 33:52.790
Are you hurt?

33:52.790 --> 33:54.000
No. I'm fine.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.210
He took them. He took them both.

33:56.210 --> 33:58.210
We need to issue an Amber Alert.

34:17.880 --> 34:21.460
The Harley was reported stolen in
Odessa, Texas, three weeks ago.

34:21.920 --> 34:23.790
She said Mason was by himself.

34:23.790 --> 34:25.330
What happened to Turner?

34:25.330 --> 34:27.460
I bet it got pretty ugly
when they split up.

34:27.460 --> 34:29.710
Hotch is out coordinating roadblocks
and canvassing the area,

34:29.710 --> 34:30.880
but so far nothing.

34:30.880 --> 34:33.500
Why switch directions
and risk coming all the way back here?

34:33.500 --> 34:35.790
He's strung out
and believes that boy Cole is his son.

34:35.790 --> 34:37.080
He's capable of anything.

34:37.080 --> 34:38.380
We should extend the Amber Alert.

34:38.380 --> 34:41.080
Agents! Tammy Vasquez's
pickup truck was spotted

34:41.080 --> 34:42.620
heading south on Route 34.

34:42.620 --> 34:43.790
Is that far from here?

34:43.790 --> 34:46.420
About 10 miles or so.
State police have major roadways

34:46.420 --> 34:48.210
on the other end blocked off
so he can't get out,

34:48.210 --> 34:50.120
but it cuts through
the Santa Fe National Forest.

34:50.620 --> 34:52.790
If he knows what he's doing,
he can hole up out there for weeks.

34:52.790 --> 34:54.380
Where would he go
to access fresh water?

34:54.380 --> 34:57.540
There's an old abandoned campground.
It doesn't get used much.

34:57.540 --> 34:59.380
Sometimes the kids
go up there to drink.

34:59.380 --> 35:01.040
He'd want to go someplace familiar.

35:01.420 --> 35:04.460
Agents, if you don't mind
me making a suggestion,

35:04.460 --> 35:06.670
I know that place
like the back of my hand.

35:06.670 --> 35:08.210
My dad used to
take me hunting up there.

35:10.670 --> 35:11.960
Look, here's the campground.

35:13.620 --> 35:15.750
Try and get some rest,
okay, baby?

35:15.750 --> 35:17.920
But I'm not tired. I'm hungry.

35:18.620 --> 35:20.460
We'll get you something to eat soon.

35:20.460 --> 35:23.000
Mama, can I play on your phone?

35:23.000 --> 35:27.580
Oh, baby, Mama forgot it.

35:31.580 --> 35:34.210
We're gonna get you
something to eat soon, I promise.

35:40.500 --> 35:43.500
He needs to eat. We all do.

35:48.080 --> 35:49.960
Well, we're just gonna
have to wait a little while, okay?

35:50.210 --> 35:51.380
How long?

35:51.380 --> 35:52.880
Just till things cool off.

35:52.880 --> 35:54.040
Duke, what are you doing?

35:54.040 --> 35:55.460
I'm taking care of my son.

35:55.460 --> 35:58.170
If you were taking care of him,
you'd get him something to eat.

35:58.170 --> 35:59.330
So he is mine.

35:59.330 --> 36:00.880
Damn it, Duke, yes.

36:00.880 --> 36:02.170
That's what you want to hear?

36:02.170 --> 36:03.330
You know he's yours.

36:03.330 --> 36:04.670
Why didn't you tell me?

36:04.670 --> 36:06.500
I wrote you all them letters from jail,

36:06.500 --> 36:07.710
you ain't ever wrote back.

36:07.710 --> 36:09.750
Screw your letters, Duke!

36:09.750 --> 36:10.920
You changed.

36:11.250 --> 36:14.040
All that crystal,
always tweaked out and angry.

36:14.040 --> 36:15.420
Your sketchy friends.

36:15.420 --> 36:16.580
They ain't got nothing to do with this.

36:16.580 --> 36:18.380
-I loved you.
-I loved you, too.

36:18.380 --> 36:20.000
No, you didn't,
because you wouldn't stop.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.620
All your cared about was getting high.

36:21.620 --> 36:24.540
I had a right to know that I had a son,

36:25.040 --> 36:26.830
that I had a boy waiting for me,

36:26.830 --> 36:29.670
that my bloodline
is sitting in that truck right now.

36:29.670 --> 36:31.670
You're the one who left, remember?

36:32.040 --> 36:34.380
You didn't say a word.
You just took off!

36:34.790 --> 36:38.790
Then all of a sudden,
you're sending me letters from prison?

36:38.790 --> 36:40.960
And six years later you show up?

36:42.210 --> 36:44.420
You're gonna want to
watch the way you talk to me.

36:47.580 --> 36:50.210
Duke, it was you,
six years ago, wasn't it?

36:50.210 --> 36:52.790
It's okay. Look, it's all right, Tammy.

36:52.790 --> 36:55.170
I ain't like my daddy, or that drunk
bastard my mama married.

36:55.420 --> 36:56.880
I'm gonna take care of my boy.

36:56.880 --> 36:59.290
It was you, Duke. It was you, wasn't it?

36:59.290 --> 37:01.000
You killed all those kids.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.120
All right, I'm gonna show you
I can be a good daddy to him.

37:04.120 --> 37:06.330
I can be there for you. Hey, buddy.

37:06.330 --> 37:07.830
-There he is.
-Baby.

37:07.830 --> 37:10.330
There's my boy. That's my son.

37:10.330 --> 37:11.540
Go.

37:11.540 --> 37:13.040
-You're doin' real good...
-

37:17.460 --> 37:18.540
It's okay.

37:24.540 --> 37:27.580
Well, ain't this special.
A little family outing.

37:27.580 --> 37:28.750
What you doing here, Les?

37:28.750 --> 37:29.960
Did you follow me?

37:29.960 --> 37:31.920
Oh, she's real pretty, brother.

37:31.920 --> 37:34.120
-I can't say I blame you. -Who is this, Duke?

37:34.120 --> 37:35.880
Oh, I'm his partner, sweetheart.

37:35.880 --> 37:39.250
Me and him, we got real big plans,
and you ain't a part of that picture.

37:39.250 --> 37:40.580
You better back off, Les.

37:40.580 --> 37:42.290
Oh, yeah

37:42.290 --> 37:44.540
You gonna sucker punch me
like a little bitch again?

37:44.540 --> 37:46.210
FBI, drop the weapon!

37:53.040 --> 37:54.790
I ain't going back to jail, man.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.120
Whoo!

38:18.000 --> 38:20.750
Blaze of glory, man! Blaze of glory!

38:36.500 --> 38:37.670
Nice shot.

38:37.670 --> 38:38.790
Can you get a bead on the other one?

38:40.620 --> 38:41.790
He's still covered.

38:41.790 --> 38:43.040
Lester!

38:43.040 --> 38:44.880
Man, he got me good.

38:48.330 --> 38:50.250
