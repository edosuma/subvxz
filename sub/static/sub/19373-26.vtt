Marshall!

06:31.392 --> 06:35.160
(Siren wailing)

06:37.965 --> 06:39.731
This should be the place, pups.

06:39.733 --> 06:40.699
(Horn honking)

06:40.700 --> 06:41.666
This should be the place, pups.

06:41.668 --> 06:42.217
Ooh!

06:42.218 --> 06:42.767
This should be the place, pups.

06:42.770 --> 06:43.819
Mayor Goodway,
what are you doing here?

06:43.820 --> 06:44.869
This should be the place, pups.

06:44.872 --> 06:46.171
I got a Luke Stars
fan club alert

06:46.172 --> 06:47.471
This should be the place, pups.

06:47.474 --> 06:48.407
about his surprise
performance today.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.341
This should be the place, pups.

06:49.343 --> 06:51.009
You know I'm his number fan and
Chickaletta is his number one

06:51.010 --> 06:52.676
This should be the place, pups.

06:52.679 --> 06:53.462
purse chicken fan.

06:53.463 --> 06:54.246
This should be the place, pups.

06:54.248 --> 06:54.697
(Clucking)

06:54.698 --> 06:55.147
This should be the place, pups.

06:55.149 --> 06:56.165
Then, I got an update
that Luke needed rescuing,

06:56.166 --> 06:57.182
This should be the place, pups.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.450
so I followed you from
Adventure Bay. Where is he?

06:58.451 --> 06:59.717
This should be the place, pups.

06:59.720 --> 07:00.986
Hey, everyone.
I'm up here.

07:00.987 --> 07:02.253
This should be the place, pups.

07:02.256 --> 07:03.589
Oh, my stars!
Luke is in danger!

07:03.590 --> 07:04.923
This should be the place, pups.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.025
Don't worry, Mayor. Marshall's
gonna bring him down safely.

07:07.026 --> 07:09.126
This should be the place, pups.

07:09.129 --> 07:09.928
(Beeping)
You bet.

07:09.929 --> 07:10.728
This should be the place, pups.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.297
(Barking)
Ladder.

07:12.298 --> 07:13.864
This should be the place, pups.

07:14.401 --> 07:16.635
Good to see you,
my main pup, Marshall.

07:16.637 --> 07:18.287
You too, Luke.
Just climb down the ladder.

07:18.288 --> 07:19.938
Good to see you,
my main pup, Marshall.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.106
I'll be right behind you.

07:21.107 --> 07:22.273
Good to see you,
my main pup, Marshall.

07:25.279 --> 07:27.379
(Chirping)
Whoa! Whoa!

07:27.381 --> 07:27.963

07:34.053 --> 07:34.685

Whoa! Whoa!

07:34.688 --> 07:35.988
I mean, good Lukeness

07:35.989 --> 07:37.289
(Chirping)
Whoa! Whoa!

07:37.291 --> 07:38.090

07:39.375 --> 07:39.857
(Chirping)
Whoa! Whoa!

07:39.860 --> 07:41.944
But I can't celebrate until
I get my lucky hat back.

07:41.945 --> 07:44.029
(Chirping)
Whoa! Whoa!

07:44.031 --> 07:44.563
I can't sing without it.

07:44.564 --> 07:45.096
(Chirping)
Whoa! Whoa!

07:45.098 --> 07:46.631
Can't sing?
This is a hatastrophe!

07:46.632 --> 07:48.165
(Chirping)
Whoa! Whoa!

07:48.168 --> 07:50.669
PAW Patrol, you simply
must find Luke's lucky hat!

07:50.670 --> 07:53.171
(Chirping)
Whoa! Whoa!

07:53.173 --> 07:53.772
We're on it, Mayor Goodway.

07:53.773 --> 07:54.372
(Chirping)
Whoa! Whoa!

07:54.374 --> 07:56.274
Spy Chase is gonna launch his
drone and find that raccoon.

07:56.275 --> 07:58.175
(Chirping)
Whoa! Whoa!

07:58.178 --> 08:00.078
(Barking)
Drone launch!

08:00.079 --> 08:01.979
(Chirping)
Whoa! Whoa!

08:07.154 --> 08:10.655
Now, let's take a look.

08:10.657 --> 08:11.273
Whoa!

08:11.274 --> 08:11.890
Now, let's take a look.

08:11.892 --> 08:12.941
Good thing my drone can't smell.

08:12.942 --> 08:13.991
Now, let's take a look.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.027
No raccoon yet, Ryder.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.061
Now, let's take a look.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.446
Hmm. Try searching near water.

08:17.447 --> 08:18.830
Now, let's take a look.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.149
Raccoons like to
wash their food.

08:21.150 --> 08:23.467
Now, let's take a look.

08:23.470 --> 08:24.736
CHASE:
There's our masked suspect.

08:24.737 --> 08:26.003
Now, let's take a look.

08:26.006 --> 08:26.939
And there's my hat!

08:26.940 --> 08:27.873
Now, let's take a look.

08:27.875 --> 08:28.574
No!

08:28.575 --> 08:29.274
Now, let's take a look.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.609
Please don't get it wet.

08:30.610 --> 08:31.943
Now, let's take a look.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.481
Let's go get that hat.

08:36.483 --> 08:37.482
(Siren sounding)

08:37.483 --> 08:38.482
Let's go get that hat.

08:38.485 --> 08:40.402
(Siren wailing)

08:40.403 --> 08:42.320
Let's go get that hat.

08:44.491 --> 08:45.690
(Chittering)

08:45.692 --> 08:46.174
I've got this.

08:46.175 --> 08:46.657
(Chittering)

08:46.660 --> 08:48.360
(Barking)
Wall-walkers.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.061
(Chittering)

08:55.235 --> 08:56.334
(Straining)

08:56.336 --> 08:56.985
I can't reach the hat.

08:56.986 --> 08:57.635
(Straining)

08:57.638 --> 08:59.254
The raccoon is too far down.

08:59.255 --> 09:00.871
(Straining)

09:00.874 --> 09:01.690
Maybe we can coax the raccoon

09:01.691 --> 09:02.507
(Straining)

09:02.509 --> 09:04.242
out of the tree
with a pup treat.

09:04.243 --> 09:05.976
(Straining)

09:05.979 --> 09:07.112
Catch!

09:07.113 --> 09:08.246
(Straining)

09:09.383 --> 09:11.483
Hey, Raccoon.

09:11.485 --> 09:13.168
I've got a nice
treat for you.

09:13.169 --> 09:14.852
Hey, Raccoon.

09:14.855 --> 09:16.371
Not interested. Oops.

09:16.372 --> 09:17.888
Hey, Raccoon.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.426
Sorry. Rubble always says,

09:21.428 --> 09:22.327
"Never let a
pup treat go to waste."

09:22.328 --> 09:23.227
Sorry. Rubble always says,

09:23.230 --> 09:24.880
That's okay. I wonder
what else that raccoon likes.

09:24.881 --> 09:26.531
Sorry. Rubble always says,

09:26.533 --> 09:28.166
Beats me. It was just sitting
and listening to me sing

09:28.167 --> 09:29.800
Sorry. Rubble always says,

09:29.803 --> 09:30.619
before it took my hat.

09:30.620 --> 09:31.436
Sorry. Rubble always says,

09:31.438 --> 09:32.654
What if you try
singing to it again?

09:32.655 --> 09:33.871
Sorry. Rubble always says,

09:33.874 --> 09:34.489
Then, maybe it'll come out.

09:34.490 --> 09:35.105
Sorry. Rubble always says,

09:35.108 --> 09:36.808
No one could resist
the voice of Luke Stars.

09:36.809 --> 09:38.509
Sorry. Rubble always says,

09:38.512 --> 09:39.061
Um.

09:39.062 --> 09:39.611
Sorry. Rubble always says,

09:39.613 --> 09:40.495
Would it help to wear my helmet?

09:40.496 --> 09:41.378
Sorry. Rubble always says,

09:41.381 --> 09:42.731
Aw, thanks, Marshall,
but I need my hat.

09:42.732 --> 09:44.082
Sorry. Rubble always says,

09:44.084 --> 09:45.200
I feel strange
singing without it,

09:45.201 --> 09:46.317
Sorry. Rubble always says,

09:46.320 --> 09:47.586
especially when
everyone's looking at me.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.853
Sorry. Rubble always says,

09:48.855 --> 09:50.388
What if we all turned around?

09:50.389 --> 09:51.922
Sorry. Rubble always says,

09:51.925 --> 09:52.307
(Clucking)

09:52.308 --> 09:52.690
Sorry. Rubble always says,

09:52.693 --> 09:53.625
That includes
purse chickens.

09:53.626 --> 09:54.558
Sorry. Rubble always says,

09:54.561 --> 09:55.777
¶ You're my perfect friend ¶

09:55.778 --> 09:56.994
Sorry. Rubble always says,

09:56.997 --> 09:57.696
¶ Oh, you're
my perfect friend ¶

09:57.697 --> 09:58.396
Sorry. Rubble always says,

09:58.398 --> 09:59.781
It's working!
Keep singing!

09:59.782 --> 10:01.165
Sorry. Rubble always says,

10:01.168 --> 10:03.235
¶ Whenever we're together,
never want the time to end ¶

10:03.236 --> 10:05.303
Sorry. Rubble always says,

10:05.305 --> 10:06.822
¶ Oh, you're my perfect friend ¶

10:06.823 --> 10:08.340
Sorry. Rubble always says,

10:08.342 --> 10:09.141
(Chirping)

10:09.142 --> 10:09.941
Sorry. Rubble always says,

10:09.943 --> 10:10.459
(Chittering)

10:10.460 --> 10:10.976
Sorry. Rubble always says,

10:10.978 --> 10:13.162
All right! Thanks for helping me
get my hat back, PAW Patrol.

10:13.163 --> 10:15.347
Sorry. Rubble always says,

10:15.349 --> 10:15.848
No worries, Luke.

10:15.849 --> 10:16.348
Sorry. Rubble always says,

10:16.350 --> 10:18.333
Whenever you're in trouble,
just sing out for help.

10:18.334 --> 10:20.317
Sorry. Rubble always says,

10:23.624 --> 10:25.824
Sorry for taking so long.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.492
But I'm here now and I can't
wait to sing with you.

10:27.493 --> 10:29.159
Sorry for taking so long.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.212
It's a really great song.
Is something wrong?

10:31.213 --> 10:33.263
Sorry for taking so long.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.616
I'm a little nervous.

10:34.617 --> 10:35.967
Sorry for taking so long.

10:35.969 --> 10:36.852
I get nervous too when I sing.

10:36.853 --> 10:37.736
Sorry for taking so long.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.004
Whoa. Famous people get nervous?

10:39.005 --> 10:40.271
Sorry for taking so long.

10:40.273 --> 10:42.607
Sure. But I feel more confident
when I wear my lucky hat.

10:42.608 --> 10:44.942
Sorry for taking so long.

10:44.945 --> 10:45.794
What's so lucky about it?

10:45.795 --> 10:46.644
Sorry for taking so long.

10:46.647 --> 10:47.279
I don't really need it,

10:47.280 --> 10:47.912
Sorry for taking so long.

10:47.914 --> 10:48.913
but it makes me feel
warm and happy

10:48.914 --> 10:49.913
Sorry for taking so long.

10:49.916 --> 10:51.066
and that helps me sing.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.217
Sorry for taking so long.

10:52.219 --> 10:52.935
Do you have
something like that?

10:52.936 --> 10:53.652
Sorry for taking so long.

10:53.654 --> 10:54.953
I don't have
something like that,

10:54.954 --> 10:56.253
Sorry for taking so long.

10:56.256 --> 10:57.456
but I do have someone like that.

10:57.457 --> 10:58.657
Sorry for taking so long.

10:58.659 --> 10:59.575
(Music playing,
crowd cheering)

10:59.576 --> 11:00.492
Sorry for taking so long.

¶ You're my favorite kitty-cat,
yes, it's true ¶

11:20.446 --> 11:22.246
Sorry for taking so long.

11:22.249 --> 11:24.383

11:35.578 --> 11:37.261
¶ You're my perfect friend ¶

11:37.264 --> 11:39.231

I'll say it again ¶

11:57.484 --> 12:00.752
Happy Chicken Day, one and all!

12:00.754 --> 12:03.105
Oh, Chickaletta, where is
everyone on this special day?

12:03.106 --> 12:05.457
Happy Chicken Day, one and all!

12:06.927 --> 12:10.862
Mr. Porter,
I'm so relieved to see you.

12:10.864 --> 12:11.346
Hello, Mayor Goodway.

12:11.347 --> 12:11.829

(Sighing)

18:24.137 --> 18:25.503
Ryder!
Oh, thank goodness you're here!

18:25.504 --> 18:26.870
(Sighing)

18:26.873 --> 18:27.922
The Chicken of Honor
is missing.

18:27.923 --> 18:28.972
(Sighing)

18:28.975 --> 18:29.707
We'll find her, Mayor Goodway.

18:29.708 --> 18:30.440
(Sighing)

18:30.443 --> 18:31.442
But let's get you down first.

18:31.443 --> 18:32.442
(Sighing)

18:32.445 --> 18:33.611
(Barking)
Claw!

18:33.612 --> 18:34.778

18:38.451 --> 18:43.488
I'll help you down.
Easy does it. There.

18:43.490 --> 18:44.172
Thanks, Ryder.

18:44.173 --> 18:44.855
I'll help you down.
Easy does it. There.

18:44.858 --> 18:45.957
Chickaletta has
small delicate feet;

18:45.958 --> 18:47.057
I'll help you down.
Easy does it. There.

18:47.060 --> 18:47.642
she couldn't have gotten far.

18:47.643 --> 18:48.225
I'll help you down.
Easy does it. There.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.412
Spy Chase, see if you can find
her with your goggles.

18:50.413 --> 18:52.597
I'll help you down.
Easy does it. There.

18:52.599 --> 18:53.398
(Barking)

18:53.399 --> 18:54.198
I'll help you down.
Easy does it. There.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.500
Heat vision googles.

18:55.501 --> 18:56.801
I'll help you down.
Easy does it. There.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.371
Hmm.

19:00.373 --> 19:01.272
(Beeping)

19:01.273 --> 19:02.172
Hmm.

19:02.175 --> 19:03.758
What are those gophers doing
with a popcorn popper?

19:03.759 --> 19:05.342
Hmm.

19:05.345 --> 19:06.661
You found my popper!
ALEX: Yay!

19:06.662 --> 19:07.978
Hmm.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.264
(Squeaking)

19:09.265 --> 19:10.548
Hmm.

19:10.550 --> 19:11.866
PAW Patrol always
gets the job done.

19:11.867 --> 19:13.183
Hmm.

19:13.186 --> 19:15.086
True. But my chickypoo
is still missing.

19:15.087 --> 19:16.987
Hmm.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.441
Chickaletta? Chickaletta,
come here, precious.

19:19.442 --> 19:21.893
Hmm.

19:21.895 --> 19:23.111
What's this?

19:23.112 --> 19:24.328
Hmm.

19:24.330 --> 19:24.779
Chicken feed?

19:24.780 --> 19:25.229
Hmm.

19:25.231 --> 19:26.581
Corn kernel?
Chickens love 'em.

19:26.582 --> 19:27.932
Hmm.

19:27.934 --> 19:28.600
Mayor Goodway,

19:28.601 --> 19:29.267
Hmm.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.335
do you think Chickaletta
could have followed

19:30.336 --> 19:31.402
Hmm.

19:31.404 --> 19:32.070
this trail of kernels?

19:32.071 --> 19:32.737
Hmm.

19:32.739 --> 19:33.321
I certainly feed her

19:33.322 --> 19:33.904
Hmm.

19:33.907 --> 19:34.706
a balanced diet every day,

19:34.707 --> 19:35.506
Hmm.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.357
but my little chicky

19:36.358 --> 19:37.207
Hmm.

19:37.210 --> 19:38.176
has a big, big appetite.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.143
Hmm.

19:39.145 --> 19:39.527
Hmm...

19:39.528 --> 19:39.910
Hmm.

19:39.913 --> 19:40.862
The corn kernels lead
to those tire tracks.

19:40.863 --> 19:41.812
Hmm.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.931
And Farmer Al bought
some feed just this morning.

19:43.932 --> 19:46.049
Hmm.

19:46.052 --> 19:46.584
(Beeping)

19:46.585 --> 19:47.117
Hmm.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.920
Skye, fly over the farms and
see if Chickaletta's there.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.721
Hmm.

19:50.723 --> 19:52.457
<i> This puppy's gotta fly!</i>

19:52.458 --> 19:54.192
Hmm.

19:57.730 --> 20:01.098
(Clucking)

20:01.100 --> 20:02.733
(Clucking)

20:02.734 --> 20:04.367
(Clucking)

20:05.672 --> 20:07.004
Ryder, I found Farmer Al.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.606
He's just left
Farmer Yumi's farm.

20:08.607 --> 20:10.207
Ryder, I found Farmer Al.

20:10.210 --> 20:11.059
RYDER:
<i> Great work, Skye.</i>

20:11.060 --> 20:11.909
Ryder, I found Farmer Al.

20:11.911 --> 20:12.727
Maybe Chickaletta's down there.

20:12.728 --> 20:13.544
Ryder, I found Farmer Al.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.029
(Barking)
Goggles!

20:15.030 --> 20:16.513
Ryder, I found Farmer Al.

20:17.383 --> 20:20.685
That's her bracelet!
Ryder, I found Chickaletta!

20:20.687 --> 20:22.470
<i> She's with</i>
<i> Farmer Yumi's chickens.</i>

20:22.471 --> 20:24.254
That's her bracelet!
Ryder, I found Chickaletta!

20:24.257 --> 20:26.007
Great job, Skye.
We're on our way.

20:26.008 --> 20:27.758
That's her bracelet!
Ryder, I found Chickaletta!

20:29.128 --> 20:31.829
(Siren sounding)

20:31.831 --> 20:33.064
(Straining)
(Yelping)

20:33.065 --> 20:34.298
(Siren sounding)

20:34.300 --> 20:35.783
YUMI:
Way to get into
Chicken Day, Mayor Goodway.

20:35.784 --> 20:37.267
(Siren sounding)

20:37.270 --> 20:39.337
Thanks, Farmer Yumi.
It is such a special occasion.

20:39.338 --> 20:41.405
(Siren sounding)

20:41.407 --> 20:41.906
(Clucking)

20:41.907 --> 20:42.406
(Siren sounding)

20:42.408 --> 20:43.508
Oh, they all look so happy.

20:43.509 --> 20:44.609
(Siren sounding)

20:44.611 --> 20:45.877
The more the cluckier,
that's what I say.

20:45.878 --> 20:47.144
(Siren sounding)

20:47.146 --> 20:48.029
Chickaletta,

20:48.030 --> 20:48.913
(Siren sounding)

20:48.915 --> 20:49.581
Mommy's here!

20:49.582 --> 20:50.248

20:50.250 --> 20:50.715
(Clucking)

20:50.716 --> 20:51.181
(Siren sounding)

20:51.184 --> 20:52.634
Oh, and there's my precious pet!

20:52.635 --> 20:54.085
(Siren sounding)

20:54.087 --> 20:54.919
Come to Mommy!

21:11.704 --> 21:14.639
(Clucking)

21:15.508 --> 21:17.642
Hang on, Chickaletta.

21:17.644 --> 21:18.259
Mommy's on her way.

21:18.260 --> 21:18.875
Hang on, Chickaletta.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.578
Mayor Goodway, wait!
Those thorns are--

21:20.579 --> 21:22.279
Hang on, Chickaletta.

21:22.282 --> 21:23.748
(Yelping)
Caught on my costume.

21:23.749 --> 21:25.215
Hang on, Chickaletta.

21:25.218 --> 21:25.800
(Clucking)

21:25.801 --> 21:26.383
Hang on, Chickaletta.

21:26.386 --> 21:28.586
They're pretty strong.
I'll help you out.

21:28.587 --> 21:30.787
Hang on, Chickaletta.

21:30.790 --> 21:31.339
Ooh!

21:31.340 --> 21:31.889
Hang on, Chickaletta.

21:31.891 --> 21:32.790
Will we ever get Chickaletta

21:32.791 --> 21:33.690
Hang on, Chickaletta.

21:33.693 --> 21:34.509
out of this thorny mess?

21:34.510 --> 21:35.326
Hang on, Chickaletta.

21:35.328 --> 21:36.694
Yes, we will.
Spy Chase,

21:36.695 --> 21:38.061
Hang on, Chickaletta.

21:38.064 --> 21:38.963
use your zip line
to go over the thicket,

21:38.964 --> 21:39.863
Hang on, Chickaletta.

21:39.866 --> 21:41.149
then pick up Chickaletta.

21:41.150 --> 21:42.433
Hang on, Chickaletta.

21:42.435 --> 21:43.134
You got it, Ryder.

Ooh, Chickaletta,
I thought I'd lost you,

21:57.784 --> 21:59.734
then found you,
then nearly lost you again!

21:59.735 --> 22:01.685
Ooh, Chickaletta,
I thought I'd lost you,

22:01.688 --> 22:03.505

Ooh, Chickaletta,
I thought I'd lost you,

22:14.767 --> 22:15.600
