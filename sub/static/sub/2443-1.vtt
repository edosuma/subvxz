I don't think so.

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:13.050
It's useless, Liz.
We can't hide our feelings any longer.

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:16.284
- Feelings?
- I don't have to tell you...

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:19.171
...I'm a very eligible bachelor.

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:23.251
Lots of women would give anything

Well, I'm a lucky, lucky girl.

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:30.521
For me, it all started months ago...

...at your Labor Day barbecue,
remember?

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:36.843
And you asked me
how to marinate ahi tuna?

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:41.404
And I said,
"All you need is Italian salad dressing."

Thank God. We got him, people!

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:55.364
Listen. We're running late,
so pay attention.

01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:59.281
We sent you an instruction manual
so you know the important controls.

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:04.122
I'll go over the changes. There are
three cutoff valves to the nitro.

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:05.891
Here, here, here.

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:09.283
The reading on the pressure gauge
should be below 50.

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:11.881
Not 70, like we told you earlier.

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:13.730
The emergency cutoff is here.

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:16.882
The primary controls are here.

There's a microphone inside the helmet
to alter your voice properly.

it's the same as we talked about.

Stick to that, there'll be no problems.

I speak for everyone...

what happened at rehearsal.

We're confident we got
all the kinks out.

showed some brain activity today.

In a few moments Turbo Man will pick
a special child from the audience.

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:09.841
That child will be the winner
of a special edition Turbo Man doll.
