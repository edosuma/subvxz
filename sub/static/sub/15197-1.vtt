WEBVTT

00:36.837 --> 00:39.307
(wheel cranking)

00:46.214 --> 00:48.116
(winding down)

01:24.785 --> 01:27.388
Nil desperandum,
eh, Taxi?

01:34.928 --> 01:36.530
Ah!

01:36.564 --> 01:38.499
Almost as new.

01:38.532 --> 01:41.169
A First Millennium BC
dog bowl...

01:43.571 --> 01:46.540
for the Labrador
of Liverpool Street.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.409
(sniffing)

01:48.442 --> 01:49.743
(whimpering)
(smacks lips)

01:54.282 --> 01:56.217
MAN: Oh, there you are,
Mr. Bunbury.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.919
You were supposed to be
giving your speech
four and half minutes ago.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.389
I think it's a rather
good turnout, don't you?
Yes.

02:01.422 --> 02:04.192
More chance for you
to screw it up.
You'll be fine.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.593
You will be fine.
Yes.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.861
I'll have them eating
out of my hand.

02:07.895 --> 02:10.598
Oh, dear.
It seems a bit glued on. I--

02:10.631 --> 02:12.400
(gasps)
Oh, I can't look.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.535
Is that a dog biscuit,
Charles?
Mmm. It's rather good.

02:25.913 --> 02:28.582
CHARLES: What are these
curious numbers at the bottom
of this card?

02:28.616 --> 02:30.518
MAN: That's the date.
Oh, really.

02:30.551 --> 02:33.187
I thought the date was
the number in the brackets.

02:33.221 --> 02:35.523
Don't mention the number
in the brackets.
Woof, woof! Ah!

02:42.930 --> 02:44.965
CHARLES: Our core business is,
of course,

02:44.998 --> 02:46.834
making money.

02:46.867 --> 02:52.473
For 200 years, Tuftons has
survived war, depression

02:52.506 --> 02:55.409
and some really awful
'80s suits.

02:55.443 --> 02:57.311
I'm not looking at anyone
in particular, Nick.

02:57.345 --> 03:00.348
-(crowd laughs)
-(chuckles)

03:00.381 --> 03:04.285
Now, has anyone here
lost a hedge fund?

03:04.318 --> 03:06.454
(all laugh)

03:06.487 --> 03:09.189
(laughs)

03:10.458 --> 03:14.295
Not in my wife's
wildest dreams--

03:14.328 --> 03:15.896
He doesn't feature
in my wildest dreams.

03:15.929 --> 03:18.466
-could she have imagined
me addressing you--
-(mouthing words)

03:18.499 --> 03:24.338
as chairman of the bank
her family funded
200 years ago.

03:24.372 --> 03:26.840
-GUESTS: Yes, yes.
-(light applause)

03:28.409 --> 03:32.513
You know, I am but a small
cog in the wheel

03:32.546 --> 03:34.348
serving our shareholders--

03:34.382 --> 03:37.985
the largest of whom
happens to be my wife, Penelope.

03:38.018 --> 03:40.254
(applause)

03:41.655 --> 03:43.624
Because we here
at Tuftons believe

03:43.657 --> 03:46.694
that if we take care
of our customer values

03:46.727 --> 03:50.664
and our staff values,

03:50.698 --> 03:54.034
the shareholder value
will look after itself.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.370
(guests laugh)

03:56.404 --> 03:58.339
Thank you. Thank you.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.610
-Take Jenkins here--
-(gasps)

04:03.677 --> 04:06.680
C-Come, come.
Come on, Jenkins.

04:06.714 --> 04:10.718
Yes, you know, 15 years ago
Jenkins was about to retire.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.487
He'd been with us
in the backroom
it seemed forever.

04:13.521 --> 04:15.423
Part of the family, really.

04:15.456 --> 04:19.026
Said he'd do anything
to stay on, so--

04:19.059 --> 04:22.330
We paid for driving lessons,

04:22.363 --> 04:26.434
and Jenkins has been
driving me, well, ever since.

04:26.467 --> 04:27.735
(laughs)

04:27.768 --> 04:30.938
(snorts, chuckles)

04:30.971 --> 04:34.975
Of course he has to retake
the test every year, I know,
but my point is

04:35.008 --> 04:39.447
he represents
the kind of values
that Tuftons has stood for...

04:39.480 --> 04:41.014
for two centuries.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.583
Oh!
(light applause)

04:42.616 --> 04:44.385
(mouthing words)

04:44.418 --> 04:47.721
And-And so--
so I take great pleasure

04:47.755 --> 04:52.560
in proposing a toast
to Tuftons...

04:52.593 --> 04:54.562
and the next 200.

04:54.595 --> 04:56.564
GUESTS: Next 200!

04:56.597 --> 04:58.065
Tuftons.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.470
(glass shattering)
Good job.

05:10.411 --> 05:12.780
I have always admired
your hair.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.549
Oh, Beatrice, channeling
your inner flapper, I see.

05:15.583 --> 05:16.984
It's lovely.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.586
Grinding's the name,
banking's the game.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.788
Richard Grinding, Interglobal.
That was a hell of a speech.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.723
Oh! Apologies
if it was too long.

05:22.756 --> 05:25.459
I didn't have time
to write a shorter one.
(laughs)

05:25.493 --> 05:27.528
Did you enjoy the speech,
my snapdragon?
(scoffs)

05:27.561 --> 05:30.130
Jenkins was, admittedly,
a nice touch,

05:30.163 --> 05:32.132
if borderline crassly
sentimental.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.067
Hey, Richard Grinding,
Interglobal.

05:34.101 --> 05:36.670
Boy, I wish all my executives
looked like you.

05:36.704 --> 05:38.672
I'm Charles's wife.
Ah!

05:38.706 --> 05:41.709
Though I have been
on a sabbatical.
For 20 years.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.511
Well, the compliment stands.

05:43.544 --> 05:47.147
I wish all my wives
looked like you.
Oh, please! Don't.

05:47.180 --> 05:50.083
Get me away from this
frightful American.
It was nice meeting you.

05:50.117 --> 05:53.821
Charles, I have to say,
we at Interglobal think
Tuftons is a fine institution.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.657
Really. First-class clientele.
Tradition!

05:56.690 --> 05:58.492
I went to Yale, you know.

05:58.526 --> 06:01.028
"Y" is for youthfulness,
"A" is for ambition,

06:01.061 --> 06:03.731
"L" is for liberalism,
"E" is for enterprise!

06:03.764 --> 06:07.435
Mercifully you didn't attend
Massachusetts Institute
of Technology.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.539
You guys always been
on this site?

06:11.572 --> 06:14.174
-We didn't move here
until 1895.
-(chuckles)

06:14.207 --> 06:16.477
If you want to sell
a controlling shareholding,

06:16.510 --> 06:19.046
we at Interglobal are
highly energized to dominate
the capital market.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.182
Not sure
I catch your drift.

06:22.215 --> 06:25.052
They want to buy Tuftons.
I'm afraid it's not for sale.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.721
Charles's job is to hand
the bank to the next generation

06:27.755 --> 06:30.057
in a better condition
than when he started.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.059
Even if the next generation
don't deserve it.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.728
-Our daughter was supposed
to be here.
-That's a shame.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.864
Well, if you ever
change your mind--

06:36.897 --> 06:40.167
it is a woman's prerogative,
after all.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.617
(camera shutter clicks)

06:56.650 --> 06:58.519
Excuse me.

06:58.552 --> 06:59.653
Hello.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.191
Nakamura-san.

07:04.224 --> 07:06.494
Great privilege
to see you, Charles Bunbury.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.161
How are things
at Honshu Bank?

07:08.195 --> 07:11.565
We pruned,
cut out the dead weed,

07:11.599 --> 07:14.702
and now we sow the seeds
over long-term success

07:14.735 --> 07:16.737
to become ichiban.

07:16.770 --> 07:21.141
-Number-one bank on planet.
-So I see.

07:21.174 --> 07:23.477
(clicks)

07:23.511 --> 07:24.912
What is this,
Charles Bunbury?

07:24.945 --> 07:27.781
Tuftons sponsors the world
wiff waff championships.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.717
Wiff waff?
What is wiff waff?

07:29.750 --> 07:32.586
It was invented on
the dining tables of England
in the 1880s.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.555
You mean ping-pong?
Wiff waff.

07:34.588 --> 07:37.491
So called because
its first bats used parchment
stretched across the frame.

07:37.525 --> 07:41.161
When you hit the ball,
it made a sound
that gave the game its name.

07:41.194 --> 07:44.832
We at Tuftons have been playing
since the beginning
on that very boardroom table.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.867
So you play boardroom
table tennis?

07:46.900 --> 07:48.235
No.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.908
We play wiff waff.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.882
-I like the "riff-raff."
-Good!

08:01.915 --> 08:04.217
But obviously, we don't
have any riffraff as buyers.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.220
(ball bouncing)

08:14.227 --> 08:15.195
Ooh!

08:15.929 --> 08:18.198
Today I make you

08:18.231 --> 08:21.769
offer of a boardroom
wiff waff table and bats.

08:21.802 --> 08:25.205
In fact, whole bank.
Very generous offer.

08:25.238 --> 08:26.774
(grunts)

08:28.609 --> 08:30.911
Everything all right, boss?

08:33.013 --> 08:35.582
Flawless victory.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.857
(computer beeping)

08:47.928 --> 08:50.831
It's extraordinary.
The bank's been around
for over 200 years

08:50.864 --> 08:52.900
without so much
as a sniff of a takeover.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.668
Suddenly, two offers
come along at once.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.336
It's like London buses.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.607
What on earth would you know
about London buses?
Not a lot.

08:59.640 --> 09:02.342
Much the same as
investment banking then.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.344
Did I mention
just the other day

09:04.377 --> 09:07.715
I was telling Penelope
that I needed more space,
so she locked me outside.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.817
I think you did.
PENELOPE: I heard that!

09:09.850 --> 09:12.019
Did you say two offers?
Yes.

09:12.052 --> 09:16.657
Yes, a Yank named Grinding.
Do you know him?
Not personally.

09:16.690 --> 09:20.594
Maybe he heard about
our sticky patch.
"Sticky patch"?

09:20.628 --> 09:22.295
(whispering)
What sticky patch?
Relax.

09:22.329 --> 09:25.032
I've just done a trade
to end all trades.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.801
(computer beeping)

09:27.835 --> 09:29.036
(chattering)

09:29.069 --> 09:31.004
MAN: Look out!
(women gasping)

09:33.974 --> 09:37.010
(guests murmuring)

09:39.647 --> 09:42.015
Geez! Where's armed security?

09:47.320 --> 09:49.356
(guests gasping)

09:49.389 --> 09:51.291
(snickers)

09:51.324 --> 09:55.262
-Capitalism isn't working!
-Protesting isn't working.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.297
-Get down from there!
-Make me!

09:57.330 --> 09:58.732
Who the hell is that?

09:58.766 --> 10:00.000
PENELOPE: Get down, I say!

10:01.001 --> 10:02.903
That's our daughter.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.406
Pumpkin!

10:06.439 --> 10:08.375
(whispering)
I didn't think you were coming.

10:08.408 --> 10:12.880
-This bank paid for your
education, your clothes--
-And don't I know it.

10:12.913 --> 10:16.016
Still you think
that A-level is the first row
of Top Shop.

10:16.049 --> 10:19.052
I made it clear
that if she ran off
with the hippie-dippies,

10:19.086 --> 10:20.954
the checkbook
would be closed.

10:20.988 --> 10:23.290
Are we blackmailing
our daughter?
It's a good thing.

10:23.323 --> 10:26.326
Money may not be everything,
but it keeps you close
to your children.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.395
Oh, please, someone
just Tase me.

10:28.428 --> 10:30.430
-I can't bare
to hear this again.
-(kisses)

10:30.463 --> 10:31.631
Cheerio!

10:33.767 --> 10:37.771
-Do you know that man?
-Well, you always say you want
to meet my boyfriends.

10:37.805 --> 10:40.440
-(giggles) Excuse me!
-Just get them
out of here.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.310
(shouting)

10:43.343 --> 10:45.713
You know, she really
doesn't mean it, dear.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.681
She doesn't know
what she means.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.317
DAUGHTER: Bye!

10:50.350 --> 10:52.085
So what's your secret?

10:53.887 --> 10:56.924
Oh, uh, we go out
twice a week.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.759
I go out Tuesdays
and Thursdays.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.427
Penelope goes out
Wednesdays and Fridays.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.062
Don't give me that.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.832
How did you two become
banking's power couple?

11:04.865 --> 11:06.466
Ah.

11:06.499 --> 11:09.703
Well, when her father realized
we were going to be a fixture,

11:09.737 --> 11:11.671
he decided I needed a job.

11:13.774 --> 11:17.477
So you don't have any
banking qualifications?
No, not at all.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.913
I'm luckily surrounded
by some very clever people.

11:19.947 --> 11:21.815
Take young Nick Freeman
over there.

11:21.849 --> 11:25.018
When he first joined he didn't
know his mushy pea from
his avocado mousse.

11:25.052 --> 11:26.920
Now he's one of our
rising stars.

11:26.954 --> 11:29.489
Today, he completed
the trade to end all trades

11:29.522 --> 11:31.959
to help us through
our sticky patch.

11:31.992 --> 11:34.361
Sticky patch?

11:34.394 --> 11:36.930
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

11:36.964 --> 11:40.033
Oh, we couldn't be
in better shape, old bean.
(nervous chuckle)

11:40.067 --> 11:43.871
Just, uh, take a look at some
of these big numbers, huh?

11:46.874 --> 11:48.441
That's in brackets.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.811
A detail.

11:50.844 --> 11:53.113
Must speak to my accountant
about it. Graham!

11:53.146 --> 11:57.417
(clears throat)
What are these, uh--
these brackets for?

12:01.121 --> 12:03.857
After my discovery
last night,

12:03.891 --> 12:08.962
I'd say our conservative
estimate were about £306 million
behind budget

12:08.996 --> 12:12.032
with very little chance
of making it up
before year's end.

12:12.065 --> 12:15.969
Now, I'd say we have
no alternative but to issue
a profits warning.

12:17.504 --> 12:20.140
I want to say I feel very
queasy about these numbers.

12:20.173 --> 12:22.976
Relax, Arthur.
You're a non-exec.

12:23.010 --> 12:25.813
You're like the lights
on our corporate Christmas tree.

12:25.846 --> 12:28.115
You just sparkle brightly.
You're not supposed to
actually do anything.

12:28.148 --> 12:29.883
That's unfair.

12:29.917 --> 12:32.452
I always represent the bank
at the Chelsea Flower Show.

12:32.485 --> 12:34.922
It all relates to our
position in mortgage-backed
securities.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.057
I don't need to tell you
what that means.

12:37.090 --> 12:40.060
Absolutely.
Although it is difficult for me
to follow precisely

12:40.093 --> 12:44.131
because I've never needed
a mortgage myself.

12:44.164 --> 12:45.999
Run it past me
one more time.

12:46.033 --> 12:49.069
Okay, picture...

12:49.102 --> 12:53.173
an out-of-work coal miner
with five children living in
a council flat.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.908
"Ninjas," we call them.

12:54.942 --> 12:57.444
No income, no job,
no assets.

12:59.179 --> 13:02.115
The ninja is approached
by a young aggressive
mortgage broker,

13:02.149 --> 13:04.918
who offers him a mortgage
for its fully inflated value

13:04.952 --> 13:07.454
plus 20 grand thrown in
for fixtures and fittings.

13:07.487 --> 13:10.590
So, we package these
all together

13:10.623 --> 13:13.894
with loads of dodgy car loans
and a few household appliance
advances

13:13.927 --> 13:18.065
and call it
a special investment vehicle,
or "SIV" for short.

13:18.098 --> 13:19.867
Oh, I see.

13:19.900 --> 13:23.003
So, it's a "sieve"
because it's got holes in it.

13:23.036 --> 13:27.107
But what happens when someone
wants to know what's left
in this sieve of yours?

13:27.140 --> 13:29.943
They seldom do.
But don't worry,
because at this point,

13:29.977 --> 13:32.479
I invite the rating's
agency out for a slap-up meal.

13:32.512 --> 13:35.615
Over coffee, I describe
this toxic concoction,

13:35.648 --> 13:37.284
but they're having
a good time,

13:37.317 --> 13:40.053
they decide to give
the top tier of debt

13:40.087 --> 13:43.490
a triple-A credit rating
to disguise
the cesspool underneath.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.525
Now we're off to the races.

13:45.558 --> 13:48.929
We can package it all together
and sell it onto another bank
for 50 million.

13:48.962 --> 13:51.231
I see.

13:51.264 --> 13:54.167
So, it's like Pass the Parcel.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.036
There's a recession on!

13:56.069 --> 13:58.071
People are losing
their jobs.

13:58.105 --> 13:59.639
They can't
make repayments.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.975
Besides, it's so complicated
now nobody can work out

14:02.009 --> 14:04.244
which are the good loans
and the bad.

14:04.277 --> 14:07.514
So, I just flip
the whole package onto
some unsuspecting loser

14:07.547 --> 14:09.983
and joy-- it's bonus time.

14:10.017 --> 14:14.154
And last time, we won
Pass the Parcel to the tune
of a cool 200 mil.

14:14.187 --> 14:19.659
Look, Tuftons has always
done the right thing.

14:19.692 --> 14:24.231
Now, if we want to survive,
then we've no alternative but
to write down the investment.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.233
Good idea, Graham.

14:26.266 --> 14:31.538
Why don't you write it all down
and have a report on my desk
in the morning.

14:31.571 --> 14:34.207
Just that, um,
what I've discovered is that

14:34.241 --> 14:38.678
one of our traders lost
a lot of money

14:38.711 --> 14:42.950
on what was a-- (laughs)
pretty stupid transaction even
by today's subprime standards.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.219
Aren't you responsible
for our traders, Nick?

14:46.253 --> 14:48.555
What if I am, Graham?

14:48.588 --> 14:53.093
You two are just
doomed to have a clash
of personalities, aren't you?

14:53.126 --> 14:56.663
How can you have
a personality clash with someone
who doesn't have a personality?

14:56.696 --> 15:00.000
But Graham does have
a brain like a computer, Nick.

15:00.033 --> 15:02.702
Well, I'll enjoy punching
the numbers in, won't I?

15:02.735 --> 15:05.572
CHARLES: So, I just want to get
one thing clear:

15:05.605 --> 15:08.575
these big numbers
in the brackets

15:08.608 --> 15:09.609
are bad.

15:12.212 --> 15:15.182
Yes, they're, uh, negative.

15:15.215 --> 15:19.219
And we need to declare them
to our shareholders.
I'm sure they'll back us.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.588
Tell them,
they'll lose confidence.

15:21.621 --> 15:24.324
The whole thing will crumble,
and we'll lose control
of the bank.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.926
And that, Charles,
is bad.

15:34.101 --> 15:36.003
(sighs)

15:36.036 --> 15:37.204
Nick. Nick!

15:37.237 --> 15:39.372
Uh,

15:39.406 --> 15:42.175
last night you mentioned
something about a trade

15:42.209 --> 15:44.144
that could help us
through our sticky patch.

15:44.177 --> 15:47.114
Relax. Another day,
another deal.

15:47.147 --> 15:50.283
Have you heard of
Nurgistan Gas?

15:50.317 --> 15:51.985
No. Should I have?

15:52.019 --> 15:54.087
Largest natural active
gas field in the world.

15:54.121 --> 15:55.755
They're flogging it
to the Ruskies.

15:55.788 --> 15:59.092
But my sources tell me
they're ready to start
dealing with the Chinese.

15:59.126 --> 16:01.161
Which will triple
their profit.

16:01.194 --> 16:05.132
Let me bet the bank,
and Tuftons will live
to fight for another 200 years.

16:05.165 --> 16:07.000
That's the spirit.

16:07.034 --> 16:10.637
It's such a good deal.
I maybe thinking about
investing myself.

16:10.670 --> 16:13.073
Are you?

16:13.106 --> 16:15.108
Well, it sounds a bit
complicated,

16:15.142 --> 16:17.010
but if you're sure.

16:17.044 --> 16:18.645
Oh, I am.

16:18.678 --> 16:21.681
Or just to make
absolutely sure
of saving Tuftons,

16:21.714 --> 16:25.152
you could always
raise some capital
by selling shares in the bank.

16:48.308 --> 16:49.309
Fetch, Taxi!

16:51.278 --> 16:54.047
(barking)

16:54.081 --> 16:56.683
I have Charles Bunbury
returning Mr. Grinding's call.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.251
Please could you
put me through?

16:58.285 --> 17:00.253
Mr. Grinding is
never put on hold.

17:00.287 --> 17:02.455
Please put me through
to Mr. Bunbury first.

17:02.489 --> 17:05.291
Please, put Mr. Grinding
on the line first,
then I'll get Charles.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.127
It won't take a moment.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.162
You don't understand.
That simply isn't possible.

17:09.195 --> 17:11.498
(cell phone ringing)

17:11.531 --> 17:13.165
Grinding.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.368
Bunbury here.
I've been trying
to return your call.

17:16.403 --> 17:18.171
How'd you get through?

17:18.204 --> 17:21.208
Good old-fashioned
British ingenuity, my friend.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.310
It's good to hear from you.
Working hard?

17:23.343 --> 17:26.713
-Oh, you know, flat out!
-(whirring)

17:26.746 --> 17:29.182
I guess you're
a 24/7 type of guy.

17:29.216 --> 17:32.719
Twenty-four hours a week,
seven months a year-- that's me!

17:32.752 --> 17:34.154
(machine whirring)

17:34.187 --> 17:35.722
(barks)

17:35.755 --> 17:38.325
I wanted to follow up on our
conversation from last night.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.327
-I have a proposal for you.
-Really?

17:40.360 --> 17:43.330
Interglobal is interested in
making an offer for Tuftons,

17:43.363 --> 17:45.332
and we're willing to offer
£9 a share.

17:45.365 --> 17:46.533
That's disgusting!

17:46.566 --> 17:49.469
Okay, okay. I think
we can push it to £10.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.338
-Taxi!
-Well, don't go. I--

17:51.371 --> 17:52.705
(whirring)

17:53.506 --> 17:55.208
-Bitch!
-What?

17:55.242 --> 17:57.177
£10 a share?

17:57.210 --> 18:00.513
Charles, are you
walking Taxi?

18:00.547 --> 18:02.249
Sorry, Dick. Must dash.

18:04.251 --> 18:06.753
I'm sorry, darling.
I didn't hear you coming.

18:06.786 --> 18:10.223
Normally I spot the badgers
jumping into their traps
as you approach.

18:10.257 --> 18:13.793
Charles, I thought I told you
to tak the dog for a walk.

18:13.826 --> 18:17.130
-Do you never learn
from your mistakes?
-I try to forget my mistakes.

18:17.164 --> 18:20.233
I find there's little point
in two people remembering
the same thing.

18:20.267 --> 18:23.236
(birds squawking)

18:23.270 --> 18:28.141
Darling, I think I'm getting
a bit old for this banking game.

18:28.175 --> 18:30.777
I was born into a time
when "gay" meant "happy,"

18:30.810 --> 18:32.845
a "Big Mac" was just
a large raincoat

18:32.879 --> 18:36.249
and safe sex meant having
a padded headboard.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.786
Have I become a bit
of a dinosaur?

18:39.819 --> 18:42.355
I hope you're not thinking
about leaving Jurassic Park,
Charles?

18:42.389 --> 18:47.260
No. No, no, but surely
you're not suggesting that
I just go on and on?

18:47.294 --> 18:51.398
I generally do.
And it's far too late
for a midlife crisis.

18:51.431 --> 18:54.201
Besides, what on earth
would you do?

18:54.234 --> 18:56.436
True, I am what I do,

18:56.469 --> 18:59.406
which is not very much
admittedly.
(chuckles)

18:59.439 --> 19:02.809
Men are defined
by what they do,
or at least seem to be doing.

19:02.842 --> 19:05.612
I call it
the cocktail party test.
What do you mean?

19:05.645 --> 19:08.348
I feel an overwhelming
obligation to justify
my existence

19:08.381 --> 19:11.551
whenever someone asks me
what I do at a cocktail party.
Hm.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.520
Do you remember
when we...

19:14.587 --> 19:16.523
first got married?

19:17.557 --> 19:19.292
We agreed that...

19:19.326 --> 19:22.295
you would handle all
the minor decisions,

19:22.329 --> 19:25.532
and I would decide
the major ones.

19:25.565 --> 19:29.369
And we've had 30 years
without a major decision,
thanks to me.

19:29.402 --> 19:33.373
I think we can manage
another 200 years without one,
don't you?

19:35.475 --> 19:39.546
NAKAMURA: My offer of
£11 a share is 2 billion.

19:39.579 --> 19:44.584
A very large sum
when I get no fixed asset
if something goes wrong.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.486
Don't forget the portrait
in the boardroom.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.989
But the only real assets
are bankers

19:50.022 --> 19:52.625
who can walk out of door,
take clients with them.

19:52.659 --> 19:54.294
Mm-hmm.

19:54.327 --> 19:56.629
Have you considered giving
them golden handcuffs?

19:56.663 --> 20:01.000
-Golden handcuffs?
-Financial incentives, making it
impossible for them to leave.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.870
I need to know more about
your honorable institution.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.305
At Tuftons we basically
have two divisions.

20:05.338 --> 20:10.209
Firstly, fund management.
They sort of invest your money
until it's gone.

20:11.311 --> 20:14.314
Secondly, private banking.

20:14.347 --> 20:17.016
They will lend you money,
provided you've proved
to our satisfaction

20:17.049 --> 20:18.685
that you don't need it.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.620
(dog whimpers)

20:39.406 --> 20:42.475
NAKAMURA: Banking is indeed
a complex business.

20:42.509 --> 20:44.911
Why don't we make things
a bit more interesting?

20:44.944 --> 20:47.580
If I win, the price
goes to £12.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.517
You toy with me,
Charles Bunbury.

20:50.550 --> 20:54.354
-I hope your golf is not
as good as your wiff waff.
-Much better.

20:58.458 --> 21:00.693
Fore!

21:02.061 --> 21:04.931
-Where did it go?
-Off to the right.

21:04.964 --> 21:08.368
We call that a George Bush.
(chuckles)

21:12.972 --> 21:17.410
Graham, if one wanted to say,
theoretically speaking
of course,

21:17.444 --> 21:19.546
sell some shares at £12,

21:19.579 --> 21:22.515
how many would one have to
sell to raise--

21:22.549 --> 21:25.652
let's just pull a figure
out of the air-- £300 million?

21:25.685 --> 21:26.619
Very approximately.

21:29.088 --> 21:31.458
You have run this past
Mrs. Bunbury, haven't you?

21:31.491 --> 21:35.428
Of course I have.
Hypothetically.

21:35.462 --> 21:39.732
25 million.
Thank you, Graham.
Excellent data.

21:39.766 --> 21:41.501
Nick!

21:43.135 --> 21:46.639
This Nurgistan Gas thing,
you're happy with it?
Of course.

21:46.673 --> 21:50.443
They're due to announce
a major new fracking field,
after all it's only "OPM."

21:50.477 --> 21:52.111
"Only Penelope's Money"?

21:52.144 --> 21:54.514
Other People's Money.
Of course!

21:54.547 --> 21:57.617
We max out
the clients' accounts,
swap into the dollar

21:57.650 --> 21:59.452
and hedge into
the inter-bank market.

21:59.486 --> 22:03.055
All clear now?
Genius, I'd say.

22:03.089 --> 22:05.492
You might want to hold off
on that profits warning.

22:05.525 --> 22:07.527
I don't think
that's wise, sir.

22:07.560 --> 22:10.062
Graham, do you know why
the accountant crossed
the road?

22:10.096 --> 22:12.765
I haven't the faintest idea,
though strictly speaking,
I'm a quantitative analyst.

22:12.799 --> 22:16.035
-Because he did the same
last year.
-(laughs)

22:16.068 --> 22:19.539
Sometimes, Graham,
even as a quant,
you have to go with the flow.

22:19.572 --> 22:21.007
Let the trend be your friend.

22:21.808 --> 22:23.610
What is it you always say?

22:23.643 --> 22:25.745
Trash 'em and cash 'em,
pump 'em and dump 'em.

22:25.778 --> 22:29.482
Yes, you're the man now.
Way to go. (laughs)

22:29.516 --> 22:32.785
There are some people
who think I'm a fuddy-duddy.
That's quite extraordinary.

22:32.819 --> 22:35.655
-These are the e-mails
you need to reply to, sir.
-Ah.

22:37.424 --> 22:38.591
Tip-top.

22:43.763 --> 22:48.000
Oh, Nick, I'm not sure
we need to mention any of this
to Penelope, hmm?

22:49.636 --> 22:51.571
(chuckles)

22:53.139 --> 22:55.041
(man on phone, indistinct)

22:55.074 --> 23:00.647
Yes, please buy me
200 million shares
in Nurgistan Gas.

23:00.680 --> 23:04.484
You can take the money out of
my wife's pension fund account.

23:04.517 --> 23:06.653
Are you sure?
That's a hell of an order.

23:06.686 --> 23:08.688
Of course I'm sure.
I know these things.

23:08.721 --> 23:12.692
Well, actually I don't,
but I know a man who does.

23:21.734 --> 23:25.838
I forgot to ask, how did it go
with that dreadful American
after I left?

23:25.872 --> 23:28.207
Oh, I think you'll be
quite surprised

23:28.240 --> 23:31.811
with how I've managed
the, um, situation.

23:31.844 --> 23:34.647
Situation? (scoffs)
A polite word for "arse."

23:34.681 --> 23:36.649
(both giggle)

23:40.587 --> 23:45.091
This is Nurgistan,
home of the world's biggest
natural gas discovery.

23:45.124 --> 23:48.661
It's where they've been using
state-of-the-art
fracking technology.

23:48.695 --> 23:52.098
But this morning,
the site triggered the most
severe earthquake--

23:52.131 --> 23:54.634
an earthquake zone
in Nurgistan's history.

23:54.667 --> 23:56.536
(groans)

23:56.569 --> 23:59.506
The gas explosion was,
say experts,

23:59.539 --> 24:01.674
the equivalent of two
Hiroshima nuclear blasts.

24:01.708 --> 24:03.543
(explosion)

24:03.576 --> 24:05.578
The environmental fallout
is expected

24:05.612 --> 24:08.715
to make the damage
of the Deep Water Horizon
oil spill

24:08.748 --> 24:10.783
look like a storm in a teacup.

24:15.187 --> 24:17.690
(TV chatter)

24:17.724 --> 24:19.626
Everything all right, dear?

24:20.760 --> 24:23.630
(TV: cartoon)

24:23.663 --> 24:26.265
-What are you doing here?
-(rabbit groans)

24:26.298 --> 24:29.502
(bouncing noises)

24:29.536 --> 24:31.103
Oh, dear.

24:35.174 --> 24:36.442
Thank you.

24:36.475 --> 24:40.246
How bad is it?
Nurgistan Gas is down 75%
and may tank altogether.

24:40.279 --> 24:41.848
(explosion)

24:41.881 --> 24:43.616
Oh, dear God.

24:43.650 --> 24:46.285
I can't have lost
all of Penny's money.
She'll kill me.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.921
We're talking a paper loss
of two and a half billion,

24:48.955 --> 24:51.223
a touch more than
the net worth of the bank.

24:54.193 --> 24:58.230
Okay. Well, the bank is doomed.

24:58.264 --> 24:59.799
I'm doomed. You're doomed.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.668
In fact,
we're all bloody doomed.

25:01.701 --> 25:03.903
This is, uh,

25:03.936 --> 25:05.538
potentially very bad,
isn't it?

25:18.851 --> 25:21.253
With a global American bank
circling Tuftons,

25:21.287 --> 25:24.190
there is market gossip
that the Japanese
are also interested.

25:24.223 --> 25:28.895
So, Andrew, tell us,
what is the reaction
from staff at Tuftons?

25:28.928 --> 25:33.833
(ringtone: siren wailing)

25:33.866 --> 25:35.602
PENELOPE: What's happening?
with my bank?

25:35.635 --> 25:37.837
Because I'm here
watching the news,

25:37.870 --> 25:41.273
and it appears that we've
got Interglobal hammering
at our gates.

25:41.307 --> 25:44.577
Do we have a white flag flying
outside Tuftons already?

25:44.611 --> 25:47.680
Strictly speaking,
it's not entirely your bank,
sweetness.

25:47.714 --> 25:50.650
My point.
Any more of this nonsense
and it will be their bank.

25:50.683 --> 25:52.652
Are you in control there
or not?

25:52.685 --> 25:55.354
My war cabinet
is meeting even as we speak.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.790
That would be you,
Graham and Sophie.

25:57.824 --> 25:58.825
Uh--

25:58.858 --> 26:00.593
Uh, yes.

26:00.627 --> 26:01.728
Precisely.

26:03.062 --> 26:05.364
Charles. Charles?
Please use your brain.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.834
Definitely use your ears,
they're not just for glasses.

26:07.867 --> 26:10.670
They're not flaps of skin
that are useful on your head--

26:10.703 --> 26:14.641
They're useful things.
Charles? Are you there?

26:16.408 --> 26:20.246
Are you still listening to me?
Of course I am, dear.

26:20.279 --> 26:22.682
I had the feeling
I was talking to myself.

26:22.715 --> 26:26.719
Ha! Never! Never!
I hang on your every word.

26:26.753 --> 26:30.289
Hang on to these words, Charles:
don't lose my bank.

26:31.057 --> 26:32.625
(slams)

26:39.031 --> 26:41.668
(beeping)

26:41.701 --> 26:43.335
(gasps)

26:46.005 --> 26:47.707
(exhales)

26:58.084 --> 27:01.754
Are you sure?
The Japs will want
to take over the bank as well.

27:01.788 --> 27:03.890
GRAHAM: Getting the Japanese
to block the American bid

27:03.923 --> 27:08.294
is potentially
a bit of a River Kwai option,
but it might just work.

27:08.327 --> 27:11.330
Thank you for your analysis,
but what I really need
is your trousers.

27:21.708 --> 27:23.409
Lovely.
Thank you
very much.

27:28.380 --> 27:31.050
I wonder if Graham's okay
in the car.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.952
I did leave the window
open a bit.

27:36.956 --> 27:39.025
Mr. Nakamura,
thank you for seeing us.

27:39.058 --> 27:40.960
I understand.
Please.

27:46.833 --> 27:50.436
We would like to accept
your honorable offer to buy
a shareholding in our bank,

27:50.469 --> 27:54.807
and we'd like to ask
how you might feel
about £11 per share.

27:54.841 --> 27:57.977
Thank you, Mr. Charles,
for your very
honorable proposal.

27:58.010 --> 28:02.148
I know that my famous victory
on the golf course meant
we agreed to £12 per share.

28:02.181 --> 28:05.985
But, between friends,
that's all history now.

28:06.018 --> 28:08.154
But we have
this morning bought

28:08.187 --> 28:11.924
10.1% of Tuftons for £2.50.

28:14.526 --> 28:17.730
I'm sorry, £2... per share.

28:20.867 --> 28:24.737
You and the Thunderbirds here
thought you'd nip in
and buy us on the cheap?

28:24.771 --> 28:27.840
Integrity isn't the name
of a Japanese car.
CHARLES: Steady on, Nick.

28:27.874 --> 28:30.042
Bygones and all that.
You've done raided us.

28:30.076 --> 28:34.847
Don't forget that Pearl Harbor
wasn't exactly a sound
strategy in the medium term.

28:37.483 --> 28:39.718
We were leaving anyway.

28:41.153 --> 28:43.089
(sighs)

28:45.024 --> 28:47.960
I'm afraid it's over,
Charles.

28:47.994 --> 28:49.495
What do you mean, "over"?

28:49.528 --> 28:52.031
The balance sheet
is a mess.

28:52.064 --> 28:54.000
There's nothing right
on the left,

28:54.033 --> 28:55.367
and nothing left
on the right.

28:56.435 --> 28:58.204
I'm afraid
Nick's right, sir.

28:58.237 --> 29:01.140
As chairman of the bank,
you have a responsibility
to our creditors

29:01.173 --> 29:03.009
not to trade fraudulently.

29:03.042 --> 29:05.544
(ringtone: siren wailing)

29:05.577 --> 29:06.512
(clears throat)

29:08.948 --> 29:12.051
Charles, tell me what
you are doing, right now!

29:12.084 --> 29:15.521
Uh, well, since you ask,
sweet pea,

29:15.554 --> 29:18.157
Graham is thinking up
some very clever codes names
for bidders.

29:18.190 --> 29:22.028
And I'm working on venues
for our closing dinner.

29:22.061 --> 29:25.798
Um-- Isn't that right,
Team Tuftons?

29:25.832 --> 29:29.001
About the Americans?

29:29.035 --> 29:32.004
Not content with destroying
the bank's share price.

29:32.038 --> 29:36.175
You have allowed the Yanks
to make a rescue bid
for next to nothing.

29:36.208 --> 29:38.577
-Really? But how?
-(TV: no audible dialogue)

29:38.610 --> 29:40.847
They're about to buy Tuftons
for a song!

29:40.880 --> 29:42.514
GRAHAM: She's right.
Charles?

29:42.548 --> 29:45.852
-And they're certain to win
voting control.
-Are you listening to me?

29:45.885 --> 29:49.155
Congratulations, Charles.
You've broken the bank.

29:52.959 --> 29:56.228
200 proud years of history
gone in the blink of an eye.

30:00.532 --> 30:01.968
Something must be done.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.071
(beeps)

30:06.873 --> 30:09.608
-(beeps)
-NICK: I canceled it--

30:09.641 --> 30:12.478
pre-authorized
by Grinding in advance
of their takeover.

30:12.511 --> 30:15.181
-You do remember
the Interglobal motto?
-Not at the moment.

30:15.214 --> 30:17.083
If at first,
you don't succeed, Graham?

30:18.985 --> 30:20.052
You're fired.

30:23.155 --> 30:27.093
I thought everything was fine.
What about Nurgistan Gas?

30:27.126 --> 30:29.495
Oh, please, who in their
right mind would try fracking

30:29.528 --> 30:31.497
in one of the biggest
earthquake zones?

30:31.530 --> 30:34.100
-It was a disaster
waiting to happen.
-But-- (groans)

30:34.133 --> 30:36.903
I hope we didn't buy
any shares, Charles.

30:36.936 --> 30:38.604
Fracking terrible investment.

30:38.637 --> 30:40.139
Who, me?

30:40.172 --> 30:42.909
Of course not!

30:42.942 --> 30:45.912
I can hear you in the room.
Now pick up the phone.

30:45.945 --> 30:49.548
Penelope, dearest, it's--
An earthquake zone, Charles!

30:49.581 --> 30:51.017
What were you thinking?

30:52.151 --> 30:54.553
My Tuftons shares
are worthless.

30:54.586 --> 30:56.522
Charles-- (sighs)

30:56.555 --> 30:59.959
Thank God at least
I've still got my pension fund.

30:59.992 --> 31:02.028
Um, about that--

31:05.031 --> 31:07.566
(stutters)
That's really all I have.
I'm so sorry.

31:07.599 --> 31:09.068
Thank you.

31:11.137 --> 31:13.039
(lawn mower engine roaring)

31:20.112 --> 31:21.880
Penelope!

31:26.052 --> 31:27.253
My clothes!

31:27.286 --> 31:28.921
My shoes!

31:30.389 --> 31:32.324
Penelope? Penelope!

31:35.027 --> 31:38.030
Darling! You seem
a little out of sorts.

31:38.064 --> 31:40.199
What makes you say that?

31:41.400 --> 31:43.235
That's a Etruscan, 700 BC!

31:47.273 --> 31:48.274
(grunts)

31:50.642 --> 31:53.612
-I'm just as upset as you are.
-I seriously doubt that.

31:59.151 --> 32:01.087
Wait!

32:01.120 --> 32:04.656
No, carry on.
The golf club's worth more
than the porcelain dog.

32:04.690 --> 32:06.225
Thanks for telling me.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.060
(metal clanks)

32:08.094 --> 32:11.197
Don't you ever stop to think
how remarkable it is, Charles?

32:11.230 --> 32:14.333
That your brain starts working
the minute you get up
in the morning,

32:14.366 --> 32:18.104
and then it carries on working,
never missing a beat...

32:18.137 --> 32:20.272
until the second
that you get to the office.

32:20.306 --> 32:23.976
And then, as if by magic,
it suddenly stops!

32:25.677 --> 32:27.113
(sighs)

32:27.146 --> 32:30.082
Run a bank?
You couldn't run a bath.

32:30.116 --> 32:33.252
My poor father would be
spinning in his grave.

32:36.655 --> 32:38.124
Penny!

32:39.658 --> 32:41.260
Please!

32:41.293 --> 32:44.363
We can-- We can
get through this!
How?

32:44.396 --> 32:49.101
There is nothing left, Charles,
because you put it all
on Nurgistan Gas.

32:49.135 --> 32:50.669
I wanted
to surprise you.

32:50.702 --> 32:53.205
-Do I look surprised?
-A little bit.

32:53.239 --> 32:56.075
-You have lost all my money.
-I thought I was hedged.

32:56.108 --> 32:57.709
Well, you're certainly
hedged now.

32:59.245 --> 33:01.047
I'm sorry!

33:01.080 --> 33:03.649
It was Grinding
and Nick Freeman.
They tricked me.

33:03.682 --> 33:05.717
It was you!

33:05.751 --> 33:08.054
For once,
in your miserable existence,

33:08.087 --> 33:11.123
stand up and be counted
and take some responsibility.

33:11.157 --> 33:14.293
Everything that's ever
gone wrong with my life
was you.

33:15.261 --> 33:17.029
Surely you don't mean that.

33:17.063 --> 33:18.664
I never want
to see you again.

33:18.697 --> 33:21.400
You can keep the house,
darling.

33:21.433 --> 33:23.435
We are going
to lose the house.

33:23.469 --> 33:27.339
You've got your shares
in Tuftons. You can sell those.
Over your dead body.

33:27.373 --> 33:29.208
(engine starts)

33:32.778 --> 33:33.779
Penelope!

33:38.817 --> 33:42.688
Hasn't it ever occurred to you
why husbands die
before their wives?

33:42.721 --> 33:45.224
Because we want to!

34:00.839 --> 34:02.774
(dialing)

34:04.510 --> 34:07.146
(line ringing)

34:07.179 --> 34:09.315
Annabel,
it's your father.

34:09.348 --> 34:11.417
Yes,
I'm walking on foot.

34:18.290 --> 34:20.726
(whimpers)

34:20.759 --> 34:23.462
Very good of you
to see me, Annabel.

34:26.498 --> 34:29.301
People actually
live here?

34:29.335 --> 34:31.237
I live here, Dad.

34:34.406 --> 34:38.076
(knocking)

34:43.181 --> 34:44.150
Hey, Twig.

34:46.818 --> 34:50.389
You are aware most
of the food in your fridge
is out-of-date?

34:50.422 --> 34:55.161
(man vocalizing)
We're Freegans, Dad.

34:55.194 --> 34:56.895
Is that like a cult?

34:56.928 --> 35:00.432
Supermarkets throw away
tons of perfectly good food
every day.

35:00.466 --> 35:02.434
So we rescue it.

35:02.468 --> 35:04.203
-Where from?
-Skips and bins.

35:07.439 --> 35:09.775
-Is that hygienic?
-I have no idea.

35:09.808 --> 35:11.477
Hmm.

35:11.510 --> 35:13.912
My, these green meatballs
are really tasty.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.781
They're the dog's
bollocks.

35:22.821 --> 35:24.490
CHARLES: What else
goes on around here?

35:24.523 --> 35:26.258
We run a small
community bank.

35:26.292 --> 35:28.260
Oh! That's my girl.

35:28.294 --> 35:32.331
Someone needs a short-term loan
to repair a leak, buy a sofa,

35:32.364 --> 35:34.300
even to just tide themselves
over until payday,

35:34.333 --> 35:36.902
we do it... interest-free.

35:36.935 --> 35:38.904
Dad, people out there
are really hurting,

35:38.937 --> 35:41.807
especially when you guys
in the city screw up.

35:41.840 --> 35:45.844
I hardly think that's fair.
Oh, the big banks don't lend
money to the poor anymore.

35:45.877 --> 35:50.282
So the dongas and the pawnshops
can charge 3,000% interest.

35:50.316 --> 35:51.550
You're banksters.

35:51.583 --> 35:53.952
Oh, steady on, Twig.

35:53.985 --> 35:56.388
ANNABEL: The economic crisis
is mainly you bankers' fault.

35:56.422 --> 35:57.856
You've got lost.

35:57.889 --> 36:00.426
Every 70 years or so,
there's a financial crisis,

36:00.459 --> 36:03.362
South Sea bubble,
or whatever.
Capitalism is crocked.

36:03.395 --> 36:05.297
As soon
as the people in charge

36:05.331 --> 36:08.234
are too young to remember
the last disaster,
it happens again.

36:08.267 --> 36:10.402
Yes, it's called
the Kondratiev cycle.

36:10.436 --> 36:12.971
I forgot that banking
could be so absorbing.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.307
So is a kitchen towel.
(stifles laugh)

36:17.443 --> 36:19.978
Why are you looking at me
like that?

36:20.011 --> 36:23.515
It's just... been a while
since we've been able
to talk like this.

36:23.549 --> 36:25.451
We're not talking, Dad.

36:27.986 --> 36:30.889
You just do not get it,
do you?

36:32.624 --> 36:35.361
But when you're done
with your bollocks,
you should go.

36:40.366 --> 36:41.367
Good-bye, Dad.

36:44.035 --> 36:47.339
Why don't you...
get yourself a job?

36:47.373 --> 36:50.008
(chattering)

36:50.041 --> 36:52.511
Just wondered if there
were any jobs going.

36:52.544 --> 36:56.248
MAN: They're all going.
Address?

36:56.282 --> 36:58.917
Good question.
Can I get back to you
on that one?

37:00.952 --> 37:03.289
(clears throat) Mr. Bunbury,
without hesitation,

37:03.322 --> 37:05.324
please describe yourself
in three words.

37:05.357 --> 37:09.928
Hardworking, numerate
and upper-class.

37:12.498 --> 37:16.635
Reasons for leaving
previous employment--
"Losing the company £2 billion"?

37:16.668 --> 37:19.037
Yes. There was that.

37:19.070 --> 37:21.907
And I also...

37:21.940 --> 37:24.576
thought it might be time
for a new challenge.

37:24.610 --> 37:26.278
Right.

37:27.313 --> 37:29.014
Good luck.

37:32.718 --> 37:34.653
You got a car?

37:34.686 --> 37:36.388
My wife has the car.

37:36.422 --> 37:38.890
Will she let you
drive it?

37:39.691 --> 37:41.493
Probably not.

37:50.636 --> 37:54.440
** (dance)

37:55.741 --> 37:58.009
ALL: * Da-da-da
Da, da, da *

37:58.043 --> 38:00.078
* Another one bites
the dust *

38:00.111 --> 38:02.481
* And another one gone
And another one gone *

38:02.514 --> 38:04.650
* Another one bites the dust

38:04.683 --> 38:06.685
MAN:
* Hey, I'm gonna get you too

38:06.718 --> 38:08.587
* Another one bites the dust

38:08.620 --> 38:11.690
Think they'll get rid
of all of us?
Probably.

38:13.525 --> 38:15.561
* How do you think
I'm gonna get along *

38:15.594 --> 38:17.996
* Without you
when you're gone? *

38:18.029 --> 38:19.965
* You took me for everything
that I had *

38:19.998 --> 38:21.967
* And kicked me out on my own

38:22.000 --> 38:24.536
* Are you happy?
Are you satisfied? *

38:24.570 --> 38:26.572
* How long can you
stand the heat? *

38:26.605 --> 38:28.674
* Out of the doorway
the bullets rip *

38:28.707 --> 38:30.342
* To the sound of the beat

38:30.376 --> 38:32.644
* Look out

38:32.678 --> 38:35.113
RICHARD: Some people,
you put them in a big office,

38:35.146 --> 38:37.683
they look like they're waiting
for Teacher to arrive.

38:37.716 --> 38:39.351
You?

38:41.052 --> 38:43.755
We're all very excited.

38:43.789 --> 38:46.124
* Hey, I'm gonna get you too

38:46.157 --> 38:48.026
* Another one bites the dust

38:52.398 --> 38:54.733
There he is!
If he went into
the funeral business,

38:54.766 --> 38:56.468
people would stop dying.

38:56.502 --> 38:58.737
(groans)
Taxi for Bunbury!

38:58.770 --> 39:01.640
-CROWD (chanting):
Taxi for Bunbury!
-Bye-bye, Tuftons.

39:01.673 --> 39:06.445
Taxi for Bunbury!
Taxi for Bunbury!

39:13.184 --> 39:16.755
MAN: * Walking on rooftops

39:16.788 --> 39:19.791
* Talking of time

39:19.825 --> 39:23.562
* With our eyes a-glowing

39:23.595 --> 39:27.499
* Like the city lights

39:27.533 --> 39:30.402
* She stands on a ledge

39:30.436 --> 39:32.738
* She says

39:32.771 --> 39:37.743
* "It looks so high on top"

39:38.810 --> 39:40.679
* You know

39:40.712 --> 39:47.586
* It's a long way down

39:49.087 --> 39:54.392
* Feels like a long way down

39:56.528 --> 39:59.631
* It feels like
a long way down *
Penny.

39:59.665 --> 40:01.399
Annabel.

40:04.169 --> 40:05.537
Good-bye.

40:05.571 --> 40:10.642
* Like a long way down

40:10.676 --> 40:13.612
Hey!
This is my pitch.

40:13.645 --> 40:18.517
What's it going to do
to business if there's police
hazard tape up in the morning?

40:18.550 --> 40:21.086
I could just, uh,
move along a bit.

40:26.525 --> 40:27.826
Keep going.

40:31.129 --> 40:33.499
I do hope you're not
going to be loud.

40:33.532 --> 40:35.701
I will be very discreet.

40:43.542 --> 40:45.811
Are you actually
going to do it?

40:45.844 --> 40:47.646
I don't know now.

40:47.679 --> 40:49.848
I've been
considering it too,
you know,

40:49.881 --> 40:54.620
but I think I might
have a drink first.

40:57.756 --> 40:59.491
What have you got?

41:02.928 --> 41:04.663
What have you got?

41:04.696 --> 41:08.233
Oh, of course.
Well, you know, I--

41:08.266 --> 41:10.802
I'm afraid I'm a bit, uh--
Ooh!

41:19.277 --> 41:21.847
There was a time...

41:21.880 --> 41:24.883
when I had an office
in one of those buildings.

41:26.585 --> 41:31.790
I invented the banana,
but someone stole me idea.

41:33.759 --> 41:35.794
How long have you been
considering it?

41:36.662 --> 41:38.229
Two years,

41:38.263 --> 41:40.832
but don't try
and talk me out of it.

41:40.866 --> 41:43.902
I wouldn't dream of it,
old chap.

41:43.935 --> 41:47.573
After the banana,
I invented the Internet.

41:47.606 --> 41:49.641
Then suddenly we all got
credit crunched.

41:49.675 --> 41:51.677
The bank called in
my business loan.

41:51.710 --> 41:54.212
I lost the company,
the house, the wife.

41:54.245 --> 41:56.948
She left me for Bailiff.

41:56.982 --> 41:59.918
My wife left all my worldly
goods out for the bailiff.

42:02.353 --> 42:06.758
After that, there didn't seem
much point to anything.

42:06.792 --> 42:08.226
I know.

42:09.695 --> 42:12.664
I lost my daughter
in the process too.

42:12.698 --> 42:16.735
I just wish I could talk
to my wife,
but she won't see me.

42:16.768 --> 42:18.704
It's why I'm--

42:20.639 --> 42:21.907
Ditto.

42:23.775 --> 42:25.611
On the other hand,

42:25.644 --> 42:29.347
I can recommend a period of
due diligence and contemplation

42:29.380 --> 42:32.751
when it comes to making
this particular decision.

42:32.784 --> 42:35.253
You could end up regretting it
for quite some time.

42:48.667 --> 42:50.368
That doesn't mean you're
getting another drink.

42:50.401 --> 42:51.870
I know.

42:55.874 --> 42:57.609
Don't get them wet.

43:06.351 --> 43:08.654
(machine whirring)

43:13.024 --> 43:14.793
Taxi!

43:20.832 --> 43:22.300
Taxi?

43:25.370 --> 43:27.272
Taxi!

43:40.318 --> 43:42.287
(Taxi barking)

43:44.990 --> 43:49.027
Thanks, Caroline.
I know it's been a while.

43:49.060 --> 43:52.430
I do appreciate
you taking me in.
No problem, Pen.

43:52.463 --> 43:56.935
I know what it's like when
the phone stops ringing at
the smallest whiff of scandal.

43:56.968 --> 43:58.837
It's not easy at our age.

43:58.870 --> 44:00.672
(cell phone ringing)

44:00.706 --> 44:04.342
Cheltenham Ladies College never
really trained us for this.

44:04.375 --> 44:06.077
Yeah, what do you want?

44:06.111 --> 44:09.447
What do you want me
to do about it?

44:09.480 --> 44:12.317
Is this a bad time?
No, it's fine.
It's just work.

44:12.350 --> 44:14.986
You pathetic specimen.
You'd be out of your depth
in a puddle.

44:15.020 --> 44:16.421
Aren't you done yet?

44:20.091 --> 44:22.761
Oh, God,
what's taking you so long?

44:22.794 --> 44:24.329
Finally!

44:24.362 --> 44:25.831
(laughs)

44:27.365 --> 44:30.435
What's your job exactly?
I'm a phone prostitute.

44:30.468 --> 44:34.039
(laughs)
You a joking?

44:34.072 --> 44:38.076
It's not bad, as long as you
don't take it seriously.
You have to have a character.

44:38.109 --> 44:41.980
See, I'm a bored
and angry divorcée, who's only
doing it for the cash.

44:42.013 --> 44:44.349
Okay. Does that work?

44:44.382 --> 44:46.351
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

44:46.384 --> 44:49.955
It's for men
whose wives do understand them,
but they're still not satisfied.

44:49.988 --> 44:52.724
(cell phone ringing)
They love it!

44:52.758 --> 44:54.993
Sometimes I'm on three phones
at once.

44:55.026 --> 44:57.796
You know, I ignore them,
and then I shout at them.

44:57.829 --> 44:59.965
Yes, you!

44:59.998 --> 45:02.100
Well, you might know
99 different positions,

45:02.133 --> 45:05.370
but the trouble is
you don't know any women,
do you, saddo?

45:05.403 --> 45:07.105
Maybe I'll just take
my bags upstairs.

45:07.138 --> 45:09.474
There is no upstairs.
You can sleep on the sofa.

45:09.507 --> 45:11.977
(cell phone ringing)

45:12.010 --> 45:14.145
What do you want,
freak show?
That's my phone!

45:14.179 --> 45:16.181
Oh.
(nervous laugh)

45:16.214 --> 45:17.515
Hello.

45:17.548 --> 45:19.851
Hey! It's Richard... Grinding.

45:19.885 --> 45:21.787
I'm so sorry to hear that.

45:21.820 --> 45:23.154
Penelope,
I just wanted to--

45:23.188 --> 45:25.991
Never call me again.
Even if you're on fire!

45:30.028 --> 45:33.064
I could get you a job
if you're interested.
No! No, thank you.

45:44.843 --> 45:46.111
(door opens)

45:47.578 --> 45:49.447
Graham.

45:49.480 --> 45:51.149
* Zou bisou bisou

45:52.818 --> 45:56.054
-* Zou bisou bisou
-Graham.

45:56.087 --> 45:58.824
* Zou bisou bisou
Zou bisou, zou bisou *

45:58.857 --> 45:59.791
Graham.

46:01.059 --> 46:03.028
Graham!
Yes, sorry.

46:03.061 --> 46:05.530
I have a question.
Ask me anything.

46:05.563 --> 46:09.134
Well, you know they are doing
all the laying off
this afternoon.

46:09.167 --> 46:12.838
And apparently Nick has a list
of people who are getting fired.

46:12.871 --> 46:15.440
Do you know if I'm on it?

46:15.473 --> 46:17.976
I'm just an accountant,
really.

46:18.009 --> 46:21.947
Yeah, I know, but you've been
to Human Resources and sometimes
people just forget you're there.

46:21.980 --> 46:24.582
And they say things
in front of you.

46:24.615 --> 46:26.584
Yeah.

46:26.617 --> 46:29.087
Uh, just-just in case, um,

46:29.120 --> 46:31.923
we don't see
each other ever again,

46:31.957 --> 46:35.526
I-I was just wondering,
maybe if-- I hope you don't
think I'm being too forward--

46:35.560 --> 46:37.095
Oh!
It was just an idea.

46:37.128 --> 46:39.898
It's Nick. He must've got off
at the wrong floor.

46:39.931 --> 46:42.200
Okay. Here's the list.

46:42.233 --> 46:44.135
Better have security
standing by.

46:44.169 --> 46:45.871
Aren't security
on the list too?

46:45.904 --> 46:47.205
Move them to last then.

46:47.238 --> 46:49.207
What about me?

46:49.240 --> 46:51.209
I mean, where do I go?

46:51.242 --> 46:53.478
I worked for Charles, so--
Tracey, come on.

46:53.511 --> 46:55.213
It's Sophie.
I know.

46:55.246 --> 46:57.248
I'd never get rid of you.
You wouldn't?

46:57.282 --> 47:00.218
Your eyes are the same color
as one of my Aston Martins.

47:00.251 --> 47:02.487
They're fake contacts.
I know that.

47:02.520 --> 47:04.189
But we have a relationship.

47:04.222 --> 47:07.558
Why don't I take you out later
and we can talk about it?
Great.

47:07.592 --> 47:09.895
Bloody hell, Seddon,
I forgot you were there.

47:09.928 --> 47:12.063
It is my desk.
Not for much longer.

47:12.097 --> 47:15.967
Joking! I know there's less
to you than meets the eye,
but you're a decent accountant.

47:16.001 --> 47:18.236
I'm a quant, actually.
Don't put yourself down, Graham.

47:18.269 --> 47:21.106
(blows nose)

47:21.139 --> 47:23.274
(groans)
Look at his little face.

47:30.348 --> 47:32.884
Well, that's
good news.

47:34.920 --> 47:36.121
Wonderful.

47:38.289 --> 47:39.557
(groans)

48:13.959 --> 48:15.560
Share tips for a pound.

48:15.593 --> 48:17.128
A pound for a share tip.

48:17.162 --> 48:18.329
Thank you.

48:20.631 --> 48:22.567
Thanks, Oscar.

48:22.600 --> 48:24.335
OSCAR: Share tips for a pound.

48:28.139 --> 48:30.141
One pound for a share tip.

48:30.175 --> 48:32.343
Share tips for a pound.

48:34.312 --> 48:37.983
I suppose owing you
a pound for a tip would be
out of the question.

48:38.016 --> 48:41.152
With interest at three percent
above Libor.

48:41.186 --> 48:44.355
This whole Interglobal-Tuftons
bank thing--

48:44.389 --> 48:47.292
how can they be stopped from
grabbing the whole shebang?

48:47.325 --> 48:49.360
Why would anybody want
to do that?

48:49.394 --> 48:52.063
Well, they wouldn't, of course,
but out of interest.

48:56.667 --> 49:00.371
Interglobal have 79.8%
of Tuftons.

49:00.405 --> 49:05.210
The only thing stopping them
getting 90% and overall control

49:05.243 --> 49:11.149
are Honshu and one
private blocking shareholder,

49:11.182 --> 49:14.252
each with a 10.1% share.

49:14.285 --> 49:16.354
Of course!

49:16.387 --> 49:18.990
You wouldn't have a pound
I could borrow, would you?

49:19.024 --> 49:20.291
I'll give you a tip.

49:24.129 --> 49:26.364
Try Nurgistan Gas. It's going
to be a recovery play.

49:26.397 --> 49:30.168
Nurgistan? Nurgistan Gas?
Give me me pound back!

49:30.201 --> 49:31.202
No.

49:42.280 --> 49:46.417
I'd rather be having
my teeth drilled--
and that's not a euphemism.

49:46.451 --> 49:49.087
(cell phone ringing)

49:49.120 --> 49:50.655
On your knees.

49:52.057 --> 49:53.724
-Yes?
-Don't hang up!

49:53.758 --> 49:57.028
First, I need to say
that I have been so dense,

49:57.062 --> 49:58.663
light would bend round me.

49:58.696 --> 50:00.798
I can agree that
you haven't exactly been

50:00.831 --> 50:03.168
the brightest bulb
in the chandelier.

50:03.201 --> 50:05.236
I know. I know nothing
about banking.

50:05.270 --> 50:09.074
You are probably
the finest living example
of the Beta Principle.

50:09.107 --> 50:11.209
-The what?
-That everyone rises

50:11.242 --> 50:13.778
to the level
of their own incompetence.

50:13.811 --> 50:16.147
You may not be
the stupidest man I know,

50:16.181 --> 50:17.815
but when that man dies--

50:17.848 --> 50:20.385
But I know enough now
to know what Grinding's up to.

50:20.418 --> 50:21.719
Pathetic.

50:21.752 --> 50:24.822
Oh, God! Penelope, oh, God!

50:24.855 --> 50:26.324
(dial tone)

50:49.514 --> 50:51.282
I need to talk to you.

50:51.316 --> 50:53.184
This isn't talking.
It's curb-crawling.

50:53.218 --> 50:56.354
Come on, Jenkins, live it up,
put it in second.

50:56.387 --> 50:59.124
I will put this through
your window. I have form.

50:59.157 --> 51:01.492
I want your advice.
My advice is duck.

51:01.526 --> 51:04.862
On how to restore
the Tuftons name.
You stole it from my family.

51:04.895 --> 51:06.831
Oh, come on.

51:06.864 --> 51:10.135
Look, everybody knows
that you were the power
behind the Tuftons' throne.

51:10.168 --> 51:13.204
Be honest.
Your husband was running
the place into the ground.

51:13.238 --> 51:17.208
He was not. He sometimes
forgot to look out of the window
and check where it was going.

51:17.242 --> 51:19.144
There, you see, we're having
a reasonable conversation.

51:19.177 --> 51:20.478
We're exchanging opinions.

51:20.511 --> 51:22.380
Penelope, please.

51:22.413 --> 51:25.383
I am big enough to admit
that I need your help.

51:27.452 --> 51:31.356
I want dinner, and I want
to spend all of your money.
I accept your terms.

51:31.389 --> 51:34.492
Hence forward, please feel free
to regard my credit card limit
as a target.

51:38.529 --> 51:40.365
Now, may I take your brick?

51:40.398 --> 51:43.401
Yes. Preferably in your
nether regions, and at speed.

51:53.911 --> 51:55.380
(indistinct)

51:56.947 --> 52:00.418
Good evening,
work slaves.

52:00.451 --> 52:01.886
Lemmings!

52:01.919 --> 52:03.821
(both laughing)

52:08.293 --> 52:11.396
Charles?
Bournville.

52:11.429 --> 52:12.897
Oh!

52:12.930 --> 52:16.601
How the devil are you?
How are you?

52:16.634 --> 52:18.569
Heard about the bank.

52:19.404 --> 52:21.406
Unlucky.

52:21.439 --> 52:25.910
Mind you, most of the time,
I had no idea
what was going on either.

52:25.943 --> 52:27.612
Well, it's been lovely
bumping into you.

52:27.645 --> 52:30.248
Likewise.

52:30.281 --> 52:33.318
I don't blame you
cutting loose one bit.

52:33.351 --> 52:37.555
Who's this? Was he with
you and me at Tuftons?

52:37.588 --> 52:41.459
No, no, this is Oscar.
He's a real business genius.

52:44.295 --> 52:47.398
Must have lunch sometime.
I'll get my girl
to call you.

52:53.238 --> 52:54.205
Oscar?

52:55.606 --> 52:57.608
Oscar!

52:58.509 --> 53:00.611
Oscar. Oscar!

53:00.645 --> 53:02.347
OSCAR: Go away.

53:04.014 --> 53:05.283
Oscar!

53:06.251 --> 53:07.385
Oscar!

53:08.386 --> 53:10.555
Oscar!

53:22.900 --> 53:23.934
I--

53:31.576 --> 53:34.412
(phone ringing)

53:34.445 --> 53:37.582
Hello. Agincourt.
How can I help you?

53:37.615 --> 53:40.685
Uh, yeah,
we're at a table right
in the middle of the room.

53:40.718 --> 53:43.921
Would it be
too much to ask
to order some wine?

53:43.954 --> 53:46.291
Certainly, sir.
Thank you.

53:52.363 --> 53:55.333
How do you like the wine?
I would have chosen
the Valandraud '99.

53:55.366 --> 53:57.268
Oh. Why didn't
you order it?

53:57.302 --> 54:00.338
I watched you order
the most expensive bottle
on the menu.

54:00.371 --> 54:03.308
You reached
your credit card limit
without me even having to try.

54:03.341 --> 54:05.310
That was our understanding.
I win.

54:05.343 --> 54:07.478
(chuckles)
Congratulations.
Thank you.

54:07.512 --> 54:10.381
Wouldn't you rather have
the wine you wanted?
I wouldn't have won.

54:10.415 --> 54:13.284
So you won,
but you didn't get
what you wanted.

54:16.554 --> 54:20.425
You are Penelope Tufton,
not Penelope Bunbury.

54:20.458 --> 54:22.627
You're the greatest asset
that this bank has.

54:22.660 --> 54:25.596
You have the name, the brains
and you're a beautiful woman.

54:25.630 --> 54:27.998
Why aren't you
running this bank?

54:28.032 --> 54:30.468
Because my father
didn't have a son.

54:33.003 --> 54:34.572
Okay.

54:35.606 --> 54:37.408
History.

54:37.442 --> 54:39.944
You want Tuftons to be
the East India Company?

54:39.977 --> 54:43.614
A great British name,
now washed away
by history.

54:43.648 --> 54:45.516
Or Rolls-Royce?

54:45.550 --> 54:47.452
They used to make
a beautiful engine

54:47.485 --> 54:49.754
to take one guy
into the park for tea.

54:49.787 --> 54:53.057
Now they make a beautiful
engine that carries thousands
of people across the globe.

54:55.593 --> 54:58.596
Which one are you,
Penelope Bunbury?

54:58.629 --> 55:01.732
Well, I'm really getting
a good grinding now, aren't I?

55:01.766 --> 55:04.101
Maybe you need one.
Because right now,

55:04.134 --> 55:06.504
you're standing
in the shadow of a man

55:06.537 --> 55:08.439
who's having trouble
casting a shadow.

55:08.473 --> 55:09.707
Who is still my husband.

55:09.740 --> 55:12.076
(groans) Details.

55:14.379 --> 55:17.482
Listen to me.
You need a divorce lawyer.
Right. Of course.

55:17.515 --> 55:20.385
A woman would have
to be mentally ill
to marry you.

55:20.418 --> 55:23.388
How long does it usually take
for them to come
to their senses?

55:23.421 --> 55:24.689
Well, my wife died.

55:26.524 --> 55:27.792
I'm sorry.

55:27.825 --> 55:29.727
Well, it's been
a couple of years.

55:29.760 --> 55:31.629
At the reception,
you talked about ex-wives.

55:31.662 --> 55:33.631
No, just the one.

55:33.664 --> 55:37.568
It's easier to be that guy
than the guy who lost everything
in a car accident.

55:37.602 --> 55:40.505
I wasn't driving,
in case you wanted
to pin that one on me.

55:44.609 --> 55:46.611
Tell me why you
bought my bank.

55:46.644 --> 55:49.614
I wanna build
the bank up

55:49.647 --> 55:52.783
according to Edward Tufton's
original founding
principles.

55:52.817 --> 55:55.620
Then you should
have left it alone
in the first place.

55:55.653 --> 55:58.756
I do so enjoy
our full and frank
exchange of views.

55:58.789 --> 56:01.826
Yes, you turn up
with your views
and go away with mine.

56:01.859 --> 56:05.763
Forgive me, but men
aren't very creditworthy
in my eyes just at the moment.

56:05.796 --> 56:06.797
Good night.

56:08.533 --> 56:10.668
(whimpers)
RICHARD: Listen.

56:10.701 --> 56:12.503
If you--

56:13.804 --> 56:16.507
What are you doing?
I thought I had pepper spray,

56:16.541 --> 56:19.577
but I'm just going
to have to stab you
in the eye with a...

56:20.545 --> 56:21.712
tampon.

56:21.746 --> 56:25.583
Now, how do I get back
to Caroline's from here?

56:25.616 --> 56:28.052
This guy's got
a broomstick.
(chuckles)

56:28.085 --> 56:30.020
Why don't you
take the car.
I'm gonna walk.

56:31.689 --> 56:33.758
Trust me, Penelope.

56:33.791 --> 56:35.693
I may just
surprise you.

56:36.894 --> 56:38.596
(thunderclap)

57:00.785 --> 57:03.220
Oscar!
You took everything
from me.

57:03.253 --> 57:06.757
And I confided in you
about e-fruit.

57:09.827 --> 57:12.096
Here. I don't want them.

57:12.129 --> 57:13.130
But why?

57:19.670 --> 57:22.840
I banked at Tuftons.

57:22.873 --> 57:27.111
No, Oscar,
that's not my fault.
Please, come down.

57:27.144 --> 57:29.814
It never is.
You're all the same.

57:29.847 --> 57:31.549
You're going
to hurt yourself.

57:31.582 --> 57:33.484
Please.

57:33.518 --> 57:35.920
Oscar, if you were
really going to jump,

57:35.953 --> 57:37.755
you would have done it
two years ago.

57:44.629 --> 57:47.632
Due diligence
and contemplation.

57:49.867 --> 57:52.603
What was it Churchill said?

57:52.637 --> 57:55.540
"If you're going through hell,
keep going."

57:56.240 --> 57:58.676
Oscar, no! Oh, God!

58:01.311 --> 58:03.147
(thumping)
OSCAR: Ow!
Oh!

58:04.549 --> 58:06.150
That really hurt.

58:06.183 --> 58:08.152
Good shot though, eh?

58:08.185 --> 58:09.286
(chuckles)

58:09.319 --> 58:11.822
Hang on. I'm coming.

58:11.856 --> 58:13.624
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

58:13.658 --> 58:16.727
(sloshing)

58:16.761 --> 58:18.929
I don't need your help.

58:21.265 --> 58:22.700
You wouldn't help me then.

58:23.801 --> 58:26.503
You can't even help
yourself now.

58:31.308 --> 58:32.543
(sighs)

58:45.289 --> 58:46.891
(horn honks)

59:00.738 --> 59:02.773
Very good to see you, sir.

59:02.807 --> 59:04.675
I, um--

59:04.709 --> 59:07.712
I think there's something
you ought to know.

59:07.745 --> 59:10.314
About Mrs. Bunbury.

59:18.989 --> 59:21.859
-RICHARD: How is
Charlie-boy these days?
-Don't you talk about him.

59:21.892 --> 59:24.795
You're half the man he is.

59:24.829 --> 59:27.331
Unfortunately,
half of zero is also zero.

59:27.364 --> 59:30.000
If that's the case,
you think I can borrow
Charles's brain?

59:30.034 --> 59:32.369
Whatever for?
I'm thinking
of building an idiot.

59:32.402 --> 59:34.972
(tires squealing)

59:35.005 --> 59:36.941
So, Penelope,
I wanted to ask you

59:36.974 --> 59:39.376
if you would
consider being a part
of Tuftons again.

59:39.409 --> 59:41.311
You could chair
the charitable foundation,

59:41.345 --> 59:43.981
advise us
on the distribution--
I get my tomato juice here.

59:44.014 --> 59:46.984
Pull over.
If that traffic cop gives
you trouble, just run her over.

59:47.017 --> 59:48.585
Be back in a second.

59:50.287 --> 59:52.056
What are you doing
with him?

59:52.089 --> 59:54.925
What the hell are you doing?
I had to warn you.

59:54.959 --> 59:58.696
He's only after your shares.
You're the only thing stopping
him from having the whole bank.

59:58.729 --> 01:00:00.264
I'm not taking you back,
Charles.

01:00:00.297 --> 01:00:01.899
I don't remember
saying I'd want you.

01:00:05.302 --> 01:00:10.274
Look, I know
I was a terrible husband
and a useless banker.

01:00:10.307 --> 01:00:12.977
And your career
in this line of work
won't last long either.

01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:13.944
(door opens)

01:00:15.412 --> 01:00:18.015
So I hope you'll consider
my proposal, Penelope.

01:00:18.048 --> 01:00:20.651
-What proposal?
-Bunbury, what are you
doing in my car?

01:00:20.685 --> 01:00:22.687
He took our bank.

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:25.756
You could say Charlie
Chuckaway lost your bank.
Who asked for your opinion?

01:00:25.790 --> 01:00:28.325
-I didn't do anything.
-Charles has always
done nothing.

01:00:28.358 --> 01:00:30.294
But he does do nothing
very well.

01:00:30.327 --> 01:00:34.098
This is pretty interesting.
Do you wanna hurt
Charles more or me?

01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:36.901
-There's no reason
why I can't do both.
-Ow! Oh!

01:00:36.934 --> 01:00:38.435
What was that?

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:40.971
I was just telling Richard
what a relief it is

01:00:41.005 --> 01:00:43.674
to spend time with a man
who isn't an abject failure.

01:00:43.708 --> 01:00:46.677
Would you at least
consider being my guest at
the Interglobal closing party?

01:00:46.711 --> 01:00:50.047
(chuckles)
If I'm not washing
my... Jimmy Choos.

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:53.417
(groans) Okay, Bunbury,
you call pull over here.
I'm getting out.

01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:55.385
Please drop Penelope
wherever she requires.

01:00:55.419 --> 01:00:58.288
Return this call to Jenkins,
and I won't report this
to the police.

01:01:00.958 --> 01:01:04.128
Richard. You forgot
your tomato juice.

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:05.696
(door closes)

01:01:08.398 --> 01:01:10.935
Stop the car, Charles,
or I'll have you arrested
for kidnapping.

01:01:10.968 --> 01:01:12.336
Fine.
(tires screech)

01:01:13.437 --> 01:01:15.906
No one would pay
the ransom anyway.

01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:17.942
Good.

01:01:17.975 --> 01:01:21.145
I'll just take my chances
with the hoboes and...

01:01:21.178 --> 01:01:22.947
(clattering)
static travelers.

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:24.381
He's homeless too.

01:01:24.414 --> 01:01:26.150
You should meet.
You are insufferable.

01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:27.952
My apologies, sir.

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.021
Oscar.

01:01:31.055 --> 01:01:32.957
I'm so glad you're okay.

01:01:33.858 --> 01:01:35.960
Go away.
I'm working.

01:01:35.993 --> 01:01:37.962
Don't--
I'm so sorry.

01:01:37.995 --> 01:01:41.365
Believe me,
I'm-I'm not that man anymore.

01:01:41.398 --> 01:01:43.400
I'm the driver.

01:01:43.433 --> 01:01:46.737
Oscar, there must be some way
I can make this up to you.

01:01:48.138 --> 01:01:50.107
Even though
I ruined your life,

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:52.042
I could really do
with your help.

01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:56.013
To help me help myself.

01:01:58.849 --> 01:02:00.818
Not even for a pound?

01:02:01.986 --> 01:02:03.120
(spits)

01:02:03.153 --> 01:02:04.454
No.

01:02:10.895 --> 01:02:13.931
Can I at least give you
a lift somewhere?

01:02:16.867 --> 01:02:18.869
Could I take
me filing cabinet?

01:02:20.971 --> 01:02:23.774
So, that was your wife.

01:02:23.808 --> 01:02:27.044
And you really
want her back?
I tried to talk to her,

01:02:27.077 --> 01:02:30.547
but she's hooked up
with her new big-shot American
banker boyfriend instead.

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:34.184
Well, you can see her point.
I mean, you don't even own
your own shoes.

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:40.524
Making big decisions.
It's all about
insider information.

01:02:40.557 --> 01:02:42.759
Oh, damn.
I wasn't gonna tell you that.

01:02:57.241 --> 01:02:58.809
Could I interest you
in dinner?

01:03:05.515 --> 01:03:07.184
Oh, hey, Sophie.
Hey.

01:03:07.217 --> 01:03:08.953
How was your dinner
with Nick?

01:03:08.986 --> 01:03:10.554
I don't wanna talk
about it.

01:03:12.957 --> 01:03:16.226
Uh, would you like to go
for a drink sometime?

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:17.928
Okay.

01:03:17.962 --> 01:03:19.830
Really?
Sure.

01:03:21.198 --> 01:03:24.201
** (women singing in French)

01:03:26.503 --> 01:03:28.472
** (continues in French)

01:03:28.505 --> 01:03:29.506
Ooh.

01:03:30.507 --> 01:03:32.576
Where is this?

01:03:32.609 --> 01:03:34.278
This is Annabel's.

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:36.914
It used to be
a nightclub
in my day.

01:03:39.183 --> 01:03:40.817
(knocking)

01:03:46.957 --> 01:03:48.492
Dad.

01:03:48.525 --> 01:03:51.962
You can't just turn up here
with your banker buddies.

01:03:51.996 --> 01:03:54.564
How dare you cast
such aspersions.
When's dinner?

01:03:54.598 --> 01:03:56.100
He's homeless.

01:03:56.133 --> 01:03:58.202
Really?
I'm helping him.

01:03:58.235 --> 01:04:00.637
Since when?
Since--

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:03.040
Oh, it's--
it's complicated.

01:04:03.073 --> 01:04:05.275
Uh, if you
don't want us here,
it's fine.

01:04:05.309 --> 01:04:07.111
Come on. Let's go.
(mutters)

01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:12.582
That's the floor plan
of Tuftons Bank.

01:04:12.616 --> 01:04:14.618
How do you know?
I've got one.

01:04:14.651 --> 01:04:17.955
How else would I know
where to put the dynamite?
Ha ha ha.

01:04:17.988 --> 01:04:21.926
Finally, you're keeping
some decent company, Dad.

01:04:21.959 --> 01:04:26.063
Could I interest you
in some insider information?

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:29.533
There's an event there
tomorrow.

01:04:29.566 --> 01:04:32.602
Interglobal closing party.

01:04:37.141 --> 01:04:39.043
He can stay for dinner.

01:04:41.278 --> 01:04:43.047
Truffles?
Hmm.

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:44.314
I went skip diving
at Harrods.

01:04:46.083 --> 01:04:47.251
(chuckles)

01:04:51.321 --> 01:04:54.558
Do you have a girlfriend
at the moment, Graham?

01:04:54.591 --> 01:04:56.326
I've analyzed
girlfriends.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:59.163
Oh, yes.
I suppose you would.

01:04:59.196 --> 01:05:02.699
I came to the conclusion
that girlfriends are
a lot like swimming pools.

01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:06.103
Why is that?
They cost
an awful lot to run,

01:05:06.136 --> 01:05:08.238
considering
how little time
you spend in them.

01:05:08.272 --> 01:05:10.941
(both laughing)

01:05:10.975 --> 01:05:12.709
Oh, wow.

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:15.579
You're well-endowed, Graham.

01:05:15.612 --> 01:05:17.147
You're pulling
my leg.

01:05:21.218 --> 01:05:24.088
I do believe
you have a ladder
in your tights, Sophie.

01:05:24.121 --> 01:05:27.224
That isn't a ladder, Graham.
It's a stairway to heaven.

01:05:28.358 --> 01:05:30.094
No, it's definitely
a ladder.

01:05:30.127 --> 01:05:31.161
(grunts)

01:05:31.195 --> 01:05:33.063
* Zou bisou bisou

01:05:33.097 --> 01:05:34.698
(both groan)
Sorry.

01:05:34.731 --> 01:05:37.034
No, it's all right.
* Zou bisou bisou

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:42.706
* Zou bisou, zou bisou
Oh.

01:05:47.311 --> 01:05:49.146
Oh, wow.

01:05:49.179 --> 01:05:52.249
You don't have
any of those little
blue pills, do you?

01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:55.185
Yeah. Yeah.
Ah.

01:05:55.219 --> 01:05:57.254
* Zou bisou bisou

01:05:59.023 --> 01:06:01.025
* Zou bisou bisou

01:06:02.392 --> 01:06:05.762
* Zou bisou bisou
Zou bisou, zou bisou *

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:09.633
** (continues in French)

01:06:09.666 --> 01:06:12.236
The last girl I dated
got a headache
around this point too.

01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:14.971
Oh!

01:06:15.705 --> 01:06:17.241
* Zou bisou bisou

01:06:17.274 --> 01:06:19.109
** (ends)

01:06:22.779 --> 01:06:24.148
Mmm.

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.155
Dad.

01:06:31.188 --> 01:06:32.656
Hmm?

01:06:32.689 --> 01:06:34.124
What's going on?

01:06:37.161 --> 01:06:40.330
After Penelope
threw me out

01:06:40.364 --> 01:06:42.232
and you made
your feelings clear...

01:06:44.301 --> 01:06:46.170
I thought
I'd lost everything.

01:06:47.104 --> 01:06:49.306
So I went...

01:06:49.339 --> 01:06:51.175
down to the river,

01:06:51.208 --> 01:06:53.177
and, uh--

01:06:58.715 --> 01:07:00.317
He stopped me basically.

01:07:02.119 --> 01:07:03.187
Dad.

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:05.122
I shouldn't
have mentioned it.

01:07:06.256 --> 01:07:08.125
Jesus.

01:07:08.725 --> 01:07:10.460
I'm so sorry.

01:07:12.162 --> 01:07:14.098
Are you okay now?

01:07:14.131 --> 01:07:16.300
I don't know. Am I?

01:07:16.333 --> 01:07:21.171
I lost the business
that your family spent
the last 200 years creating.

01:07:21.205 --> 01:07:23.240
It wasn't your fault.

01:07:23.273 --> 01:07:26.343
I was like a blind man
in a dark room

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:29.346
looking for a black cat
that wasn't there.

01:07:31.148 --> 01:07:34.484
It's so silly
investing in something
we don't understand.

01:07:34.518 --> 01:07:38.422
I sometimes think if I had
five percent less intelligence,
I'd need watering.

01:07:40.424 --> 01:07:41.825
I was the chairman.

01:07:43.793 --> 01:07:47.264
The buck stops with me.

01:07:47.297 --> 01:07:50.134
Who else could I blame?
I thought it was
that American.

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:53.837
Who I saw her with today.

01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:57.274
And you're not going
to do anything about it?

01:08:00.277 --> 01:08:02.446
You know, Dad,
in many ways,

01:08:02.479 --> 01:08:04.848
you've led
a very charmed life.

01:08:04.881 --> 01:08:07.351
I made money
the old-fashioned way.

01:08:07.384 --> 01:08:08.785
I married it.

01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:12.256
But it has left me...

01:08:14.324 --> 01:08:18.495
with an abiding feeling
that I have never
really deserved

01:08:18.528 --> 01:08:21.798
any of the good things
in my life.

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:35.779
If you really want
something in life,

01:08:35.812 --> 01:08:38.548
you have to learn
to fight for it.

01:08:38.582 --> 01:08:41.385
So if you want
to get Mum back,

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:43.386
you've got to get
the bank back.

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:45.488
Who said anything
about wanting her back?

01:08:45.522 --> 01:08:47.424
She is rude,

01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:49.792
angry, controlling,

01:08:49.826 --> 01:08:52.496
sometimes...
a little frightening.

01:08:54.964 --> 01:08:57.201
But I suppose...

01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:00.537
she's still my wife.

01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:10.814
Perhaps I could do
with joining you
for that closing party.

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:15.852
Will there be champagne?

01:09:17.921 --> 01:09:19.456
(chuckles)

01:09:24.294 --> 01:09:25.562
(gasps)

01:09:29.466 --> 01:09:30.899
(gasps)

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:40.477
Oh, I slept on the couch.

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:42.979
Oh.
So nothing happened.

01:09:43.011 --> 01:09:45.215
I was a gentleman.

01:09:45.249 --> 01:09:47.216
Naturally.
Why?

01:09:59.429 --> 01:10:01.298
I'm still a virgin,
Barry.

01:10:02.366 --> 01:10:03.933
Thanks.

01:10:03.967 --> 01:10:06.336
CROWD (chanting):
Bankers out! Bankers out!

01:10:06.370 --> 01:10:08.972
Bankers out! Bankers out!
Thanks for having me along.

01:10:09.005 --> 01:10:11.941
My friends think
it's great that you want
to save the world,

01:10:11.975 --> 01:10:14.644
even though you're old
and won't be around
to enjoy it.

01:10:14.678 --> 01:10:16.413
(chanting continues)
Absolutely.

01:10:16.446 --> 01:10:19.449
I feel very strongly
about whatever it is
we're here for.

01:10:19.483 --> 01:10:22.519
You scrub up delightfully,
if I may say.

01:10:23.987 --> 01:10:26.323
Well, let's get on
with this show. Twig.

01:10:27.557 --> 01:10:29.959
What do we want?
A fair society!

01:10:29.993 --> 01:10:32.362
When do we want it?
Now!

01:10:32.396 --> 01:10:35.665
Well, I'm glad
we cleared that up.
Take it from there, Twig.

01:10:35.699 --> 01:10:39.403
-TWIG:
You say corporation, we say--
-PROTESTERS: Cooperation!

01:10:39.436 --> 01:10:43.039
You say corporation,
we say cooperation!

01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:47.577
You say corporation,
we say cooperation!

01:10:54.451 --> 01:10:56.620
Annabel Tufton
and her plus one.

01:10:56.653 --> 01:10:57.687
Madam.

01:11:00.056 --> 01:11:01.691
(no audible dialogue)

01:11:09.699 --> 01:11:12.536
I'd like to propose
a merger, Penny.

01:11:12.569 --> 01:11:16.306
And what do I get?
Financial security.
A place on the board.

01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:18.975
Life chair of the Tuftons
charitable foundation.

01:11:19.008 --> 01:11:20.710
My knickers are not
falling for that.

01:11:20.744 --> 01:11:23.680
Come on, Penelope.
You can't pretend forever.

01:11:23.713 --> 01:11:25.549
Thought you might
need rescuing.

01:11:25.582 --> 01:11:28.552
Tell me you are not going
to cause a scene, Charles.

01:11:28.585 --> 01:11:30.954
Who, me?
Admit you set me up.

01:11:30.987 --> 01:11:34.324
What are you even doing here?
With that shark
Nick Freeman!

01:11:34.358 --> 01:11:35.659
Stop it, Charles!

01:11:37.994 --> 01:11:39.496
Come with me.

01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:44.401
Nick, did you advise
Mr. Bunbury

01:11:44.434 --> 01:11:46.536
that Nurgistan would solve
all of Tuftons' problems?

01:11:46.570 --> 01:11:50.340
You win some, you lose some.
We all make deals based on tips.
It's how the city works.

01:11:50.374 --> 01:11:53.543
But you used your contacts
to trick me and ruin Tuftons.

01:11:53.577 --> 01:11:55.612
PENELOPE:
Is this true, Richard?
What were we talking about?

01:11:56.613 --> 01:11:58.748
(gurgles) It's true.

01:11:58.782 --> 01:12:00.650
Charles nearly
topped himself over it.

01:12:00.684 --> 01:12:02.018
Oh. Sorry.

01:12:03.052 --> 01:12:04.954
Charles.

01:12:07.557 --> 01:12:09.593
(gasps)

01:12:09.626 --> 01:12:12.996
So you couldn't even
do that properly.

01:12:13.029 --> 01:12:16.132
Because he was too busy
saving my life actually.

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:17.501
Thank you, Oscar.

01:12:19.736 --> 01:12:22.739
What's Annabel doing here?
A-Annabel?
How would I know?

01:12:22.772 --> 01:12:25.609
Get them out of here
and call the police.

01:12:25.642 --> 01:12:27.744
I'll let Annabel
know you're leaving.
Shehere.

01:12:27.777 --> 01:12:29.446
A family get-together.
Isn't that lovely?

01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:31.981
Gangway!

01:12:34.651 --> 01:12:36.553
You're just
a bunch of bankers!

01:12:36.586 --> 01:12:39.489
I knew it was
too good to be true.

01:12:39.523 --> 01:12:41.725
Is that
an Armani dinner suit?
Very nice.

01:12:41.758 --> 01:12:43.493
He gave it to me.

01:12:43.527 --> 01:12:45.094
My bloody Armani.

01:12:45.128 --> 01:12:46.362
It's him, Officer.

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:53.837
You may remain silent.

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:55.739
Good luck
with that one, Officer.

01:12:58.442 --> 01:13:00.043
How dare you lock me up.

01:13:00.076 --> 01:13:02.412
PENELOPE:
Do I honestly look
like a troublemaker?

01:13:02.446 --> 01:13:04.681
And since when
has prison ever worked?

01:13:04.714 --> 01:13:08.652
I don't know.
Nelson Mandela
never re-offended.

01:13:08.685 --> 01:13:11.855
You know, she's only
ever hit me once before.
With a Range Rover.

01:13:11.888 --> 01:13:14.524
Unfortunately,
I was in first gear
at the time.

01:13:16.159 --> 01:13:17.594
MAN:
* A broken heart

01:13:17.627 --> 01:13:19.028
Good-bye, Charles.

01:13:19.896 --> 01:13:22.532
* And only me to blame

01:13:23.667 --> 01:13:27.504
* For every single part

01:13:27.537 --> 01:13:30.807
* No science or religion

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:34.578
* Could make this soul

01:13:34.611 --> 01:13:38.515
* To be loved but never love

01:13:38.548 --> 01:13:40.817
* To have but never hold
Good luck, sir.

01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:44.688
* It's a life alone

01:13:44.721 --> 01:13:48.224
* And a desperate need

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:50.159
* To be held

01:13:50.193 --> 01:13:52.696
* To be loved so

01:13:52.729 --> 01:13:55.565
* This is gonna take
a bit of getting used to *

01:13:55.599 --> 01:14:00.136
* But I know
what's right for you *

01:14:01.237 --> 01:14:04.608
* Fly high

01:14:04.641 --> 01:14:07.176
* Let me go

01:14:08.712 --> 01:14:11.748
* The sky

01:14:11.781 --> 01:14:14.618
* Will save your soul

01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:19.523
* But this is gonna take
a bit of getting used to *

01:14:19.556 --> 01:14:21.658
* But I know what's right
for you *

01:14:21.691 --> 01:14:22.859
Annabel.

01:14:22.892 --> 01:14:24.861
Are you okay?
* Let me go

01:14:24.894 --> 01:14:29.733
So, uh, where
do we usually go

01:14:29.766 --> 01:14:31.568
when we get evicted?

01:14:31.601 --> 01:14:35.505
Somewhere
the disgustingly rich
have left disgracefully empty.

01:14:37.541 --> 01:14:40.644
(machine whirring)

01:14:44.748 --> 01:14:45.715
Okay.

01:15:04.768 --> 01:15:06.536
ANNABEL: My gosh.
Look at this place.

01:15:06.570 --> 01:15:07.904
Vandals must have got in.

01:15:07.937 --> 01:15:09.839
That was your mother.

01:15:09.873 --> 01:15:11.741
(dog whines)

01:15:11.775 --> 01:15:13.943
Taxi!
Taxi!
(barking)

01:15:13.977 --> 01:15:16.312
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I'm so glad
you're all right.

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:18.147
I will never leave
your side again.

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:21.818
OSCAR:
You're famous, Charles.

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:24.888
"Interglobal CEO
Richard Grinding said,

01:15:24.921 --> 01:15:26.990
'In our quest
to become the biggest dog,

01:15:27.023 --> 01:15:30.827
we won't be doing
a Bunbury anytime soon.'"
Ha ha.

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:32.295
What's that
supposed to mean?

01:15:32.328 --> 01:15:34.230
Losing your shirt
on the market.

01:15:35.799 --> 01:15:39.235
Sometimes, you know,
a major decision
must be made,

01:15:39.268 --> 01:15:41.237
even when you're not
quite sure what it is.

01:15:42.639 --> 01:15:45.742
Then you need
to understand shorting.

01:15:45.775 --> 01:15:47.911
You do understand
the shorting of shares?

01:15:47.944 --> 01:15:48.945
Does anybody?

01:15:48.978 --> 01:15:50.614
Oh.

01:15:51.715 --> 01:15:53.683
Right.

01:15:53.717 --> 01:15:57.954
Now, you want
to short sell my shoes,
but they belong to me.

01:15:57.987 --> 01:16:00.356
So I lend you my shoes,

01:16:00.389 --> 01:16:03.326
and I'll let you sell them
for four bananas.

01:16:03.359 --> 01:16:06.830
And you promise that you'll
give me the shoes back
in two weeks' time.

01:16:06.863 --> 01:16:08.965
Don't I have
to buy back the shoes?

01:16:08.998 --> 01:16:13.870
Yes. And if you gamble right,
they'll only be worth
one banana when you do.

01:16:15.038 --> 01:16:17.707
So I still got my shoes

01:16:17.741 --> 01:16:19.308
and you--
you're up three bananas.

01:16:19.342 --> 01:16:21.010
But that's bananas.

01:16:21.044 --> 01:16:23.312
No, it's a shoe-in.

01:16:23.346 --> 01:16:26.049
But what about Annabel?
Isn't she down
three bananas?

01:16:26.082 --> 01:16:30.987
You mean Nick Freeman
will be down three bananas.

01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:35.725
But you've got to short
an opponent's stock

01:16:35.759 --> 01:16:37.326
at exactly the right...

01:16:38.728 --> 01:16:39.963
moment,

01:16:39.996 --> 01:16:41.731
avoiding an attack.

01:16:41.765 --> 01:16:44.267
And then
instantly responding.

01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:48.337
Just like kendo, which,
according to Nakamura-san,
it's just like banking.

01:16:58.414 --> 01:17:01.017
(speaking Japanese)

01:17:01.050 --> 01:17:06.690
(with Japanese accent)
I am new sensei.
Saturday.

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:14.898
(yelling)

01:17:14.931 --> 01:17:16.866
(groans)

01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:19.068
Great privilege
to have you in my house,
Charles Bunbury.

01:17:19.102 --> 01:17:21.771
I have
a proposal.

01:17:21.805 --> 01:17:24.307
After wiff waff and golf,
we are even.

01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:26.810
You have come for tiebreaker.
(grunts)

01:17:27.844 --> 01:17:29.779
I have a vision

01:17:29.813 --> 01:17:32.816
to make Honshu
the world's largest bank.

01:17:35.084 --> 01:17:38.722
If you have
a vision, Charles-san,
you should see a doctor.

01:17:38.755 --> 01:17:40.423
You're probably right.

01:17:40.456 --> 01:17:42.759
Why should I listen to you?

01:17:42.792 --> 01:17:44.961
Your track record
not good.

01:17:44.994 --> 01:17:46.730
You broke bank.

01:17:46.763 --> 01:17:47.931
Yes.

01:17:47.964 --> 01:17:49.999
That is the elephant
in the room

01:17:50.033 --> 01:17:51.768
we are currently
grappling with.

01:17:51.801 --> 01:17:53.069
What elephant?

01:17:54.871 --> 01:17:56.105
Ow!

01:17:56.139 --> 01:18:00.944
My sword will not rest
until I wake with the dawn.

01:18:00.977 --> 01:18:03.747
The wind blows
from the east.

01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:06.349
And Honshu is ichiban...

01:18:06.382 --> 01:18:07.951
(yells)

01:18:07.984 --> 01:18:09.385
number one.

01:18:10.386 --> 01:18:12.488
I am like a dark lord.

01:18:12.521 --> 01:18:14.724
Do you have
special powers?

01:18:16.159 --> 01:18:17.927
(coughs, groans)

01:18:17.961 --> 01:18:19.996
I'll take that
as a yes then.

01:18:22.465 --> 01:18:25.068
RICHARD:
And their share price
has gone down.

01:18:25.101 --> 01:18:26.936
Yeah, it's done a Bunbury.

01:18:26.970 --> 01:18:29.105
"'In the true spirit
of blah blah blah,

01:18:29.138 --> 01:18:32.175
we intend to associate
with others with sincerity.'"

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:34.778
Dictum Meum Pactum,
my arse, Charles Bunbury.

01:18:34.811 --> 01:18:37.146
- Dictum--
What does that mean?
-"My word is my bond."

01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:41.050
I didn't get
where I am today
by trusting people.

01:18:41.084 --> 01:18:44.053
Nick, you got it made
in banking
when you can fake integrity.

01:18:44.087 --> 01:18:46.155
I do not like
the smell of that.

01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:51.427
It can only mean
that the Japs want
to make a move on Tuftons.

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:53.797
So we need to put
the squeeze on Honshu

01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:56.866
to force them
to surrender
their ten percent.

01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:58.835
Exactly.

01:19:05.441 --> 01:19:08.111
Uh, about
the other night--

01:19:08.144 --> 01:19:12.816
Graham, sometimes you
just have to give a girl
what she wants.

01:19:12.849 --> 01:19:14.417
I'll see you later.

01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:41.811
You know the story
of how Tuftons made its name?

01:19:41.845 --> 01:19:43.179
Something about
the Battle of Trafalgar.

01:19:43.212 --> 01:19:47.016
All hell is breaking loose
on the high seas.

01:19:47.050 --> 01:19:50.086
At the London Stock Exchange,
the traders are crapping
their pants

01:19:50.119 --> 01:19:52.956
because they think
they're gonna wake up French.

01:19:52.989 --> 01:19:55.258
Well, Tuftons has
a messenger at that battle,

01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:59.595
and he comes running back,
and he says it's game over--
frog's legs for breakfast.

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:02.899
Do you know what losing
does to the price
of the English government bond?

01:20:02.932 --> 01:20:04.067
Toilet paper.

01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:06.836
Tuftons scoops them up
for pennies.

01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:09.873
But wasn't the kicker
that the messenger lied?
England won.

01:20:09.906 --> 01:20:12.942
Now they sell them
for a fortune.

01:20:12.976 --> 01:20:14.510
Visionary.

01:20:14.543 --> 01:20:17.480
So you want us to do
something like that?
I'm just saying,

01:20:17.513 --> 01:20:20.083
they knew
how to do business
200 years ago.

01:20:20.116 --> 01:20:22.185
The power
of inside information.

01:20:22.218 --> 01:20:25.855
Nicholas.
We couldn't possibly do that.

01:20:27.256 --> 01:20:31.928
I just wanna take Tuftons back
to its founding principles.

01:20:58.087 --> 01:21:01.257
Don't even ask
what I paid
to get it back.

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:06.195
But then I realized,

01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:10.866
in a way, it's at the heart
of what Tufton stands for.

01:21:14.670 --> 01:21:16.172
(sobbing)

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:34.057
(sobbing continues)

01:21:48.137 --> 01:21:51.207
PENELOPE:
It was my father's car.

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:54.177
He gave it to Charles.
I thought it was gone forever.

01:21:55.344 --> 01:21:57.981
It's been with Tuftons
for over 50 years.

01:21:58.014 --> 01:21:59.182
Almost as long as Jenkins.

01:22:02.151 --> 01:22:03.953
Which is why you
have to stay too.

01:22:06.689 --> 01:22:09.225
You're the last
of the Tufton line.

01:22:16.632 --> 01:22:17.366
(sighs) Taxi.

01:22:19.235 --> 01:22:20.236
Oh.

01:22:21.637 --> 01:22:23.606
Charles's dog.
Oh.

01:22:25.641 --> 01:22:27.143
I love dogs.

01:22:29.212 --> 01:22:31.080
(sneezes)

01:22:31.114 --> 01:22:32.982
You better not
be going soft on me.

01:22:34.783 --> 01:22:37.120
Oh, no. Not at all.
It's a--

01:22:38.054 --> 01:22:39.355
It's a sinus thing.

01:22:39.388 --> 01:22:40.723
Hmm.

01:22:42.058 --> 01:22:43.092
You were saying?

01:22:45.094 --> 01:22:47.763
(sighs) Okay.

01:22:47.796 --> 01:22:51.367
Based on doing things
in the true spirit of Tuftons
and its Foundation--

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:54.737
Of course.
Then my shares
might be on the table.

01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:57.640
But only at a price
to reflect the resources
of the purchaser

01:22:57.673 --> 01:22:59.142
because
I loathe him so much.

01:23:05.448 --> 01:23:08.017
(engine starts)

01:23:13.156 --> 01:23:14.390
(Richard sneezes)

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:20.729
Sophie?

01:23:20.763 --> 01:23:23.732
MAN: I think you've dialed
the wrong number.
745-8610.

01:23:23.766 --> 01:23:26.435
Sorry, mate.
I must've dialed
my bonus by mistake.

01:23:36.845 --> 01:23:38.781
Are you okay?

01:23:38.814 --> 01:23:41.084
I've picked up
his dry cleaning.

01:23:41.117 --> 01:23:44.287
I've been sent
to survey strip clubs
and rate them out of ten

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:46.455
and then again
out of a hundred.

01:23:46.489 --> 01:23:49.358
And now I've just stuck
a 20-page document together

01:23:49.392 --> 01:23:51.327
after being asked to shred it.

01:24:00.336 --> 01:24:04.807
He's not just being reckless
with the bank's money.
He's endangering our jobs.

01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:09.378
Do you know how hard
I had to work to get here?
He's not going to make me quit.

01:24:09.412 --> 01:24:11.414
I'm gonna make sure
you don't have to.

01:24:12.848 --> 01:24:15.251
There you are, Graham.
In my office in five.

01:24:15.284 --> 01:24:19.322
Get these back to Cheryl--
something or other
her name was-- would you?

01:24:19.355 --> 01:24:21.457
Have you un-shredded
that document?

01:24:21.490 --> 01:24:23.359
It has already gone
to recycling.

01:24:24.793 --> 01:24:25.794
Sorry.

01:24:28.564 --> 01:24:30.499
You're such
a decent man, Graham.

01:24:32.501 --> 01:24:34.737
Why do I end up chasing
good-looking bastards

01:24:34.770 --> 01:24:36.505
when I could be
with someone like you?

01:24:38.441 --> 01:24:39.742
Hmm.

01:24:39.775 --> 01:24:41.744
(whirring)

01:24:41.777 --> 01:24:43.512
(grinding)

01:24:48.484 --> 01:24:51.887
I was just saying to Nick,
we live in uncertain times.

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:55.124
Too right.
This credit crunch is seriously
jeopardizing my future.

01:24:55.158 --> 01:24:58.394
So what we need
is a volatile banking stock

01:24:58.427 --> 01:25:01.364
where we know results
will be dreadful.

01:25:01.397 --> 01:25:04.467
And because Graham used to be
a particles physicist at CERN,

01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:06.802
everyone will believe him
when he writes
a bullish research report

01:25:06.835 --> 01:25:08.771
to spike
the price temporarily.

01:25:08.804 --> 01:25:12.375
-We short the hell out of it
and clean up on announcement.
-RICHARD: Wow.

01:25:12.408 --> 01:25:15.478
Nick, I'd hate
to stand between you
and a large bag of money.

01:25:15.511 --> 01:25:17.446
Do you have
a stock in mind?

01:25:19.548 --> 01:25:20.783
Bull's-eye!

01:25:22.485 --> 01:25:24.353
Get in.

01:25:24.387 --> 01:25:28.324
Graham, have you
seen your buddy
Charles-san recently?

01:25:30.293 --> 01:25:32.361
What about the financial
conduct authority?

01:25:32.395 --> 01:25:36.399
Toothless. New regulations
means new opportunities
to bend the law.

01:25:36.432 --> 01:25:39.535
I don't think I should.
Do you wanna keep
your job or not?

01:25:39.568 --> 01:25:42.871
Do you know
what your problem is, Graham?
You're too nice.

01:25:42.905 --> 01:25:45.941
You could be a quality banker
if it wasn't for all
that niceness.

01:25:45.974 --> 01:25:47.576
It's so aggravating.

01:25:47.610 --> 01:25:50.213
Or I could always
fire Sophie instead.

01:25:50.246 --> 01:25:51.914
No.
Come on, Graham.

01:25:51.947 --> 01:25:55.150
Tell us what's happening
in the House of the Rising Sun.

01:25:55.884 --> 01:25:57.253
Well...

01:25:58.987 --> 01:26:01.257
they find themselves trapped
between Scylla and Charybdis.

01:26:02.591 --> 01:26:04.927
-Between who and what?
-In Homer's Odyssey--

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:07.863
-He means
a rock and a hard place.
-Geez.

01:26:07.896 --> 01:26:10.533
Talk about two countries
separated by a common language.

01:26:10.566 --> 01:26:13.369
Their exposure
to subprime mortgages
is crippling--

01:26:13.402 --> 01:26:16.472
-Cut to the chase.
-It wouldn't surprise me
if they went under.

01:26:17.906 --> 01:26:20.443
Graham, you see?

01:26:20.476 --> 01:26:23.379
That's why
you quants come back
from Switzerland.

01:26:23.412 --> 01:26:26.382
(gasps)
It's the money.

01:26:26.415 --> 01:26:29.585
Actually, it's because
it was really dull.

01:26:29.618 --> 01:26:31.620
Let's go short
on Honshu stock.

01:26:31.654 --> 01:26:33.456
You're free to go, Graham.

01:26:34.990 --> 01:26:36.425
You organize
the bloodbath.

01:26:36.459 --> 01:26:38.461
I'll take Penelope
to the Future
of Banking lunch

01:26:38.494 --> 01:26:40.529
where she will sign this.

01:26:40.563 --> 01:26:43.632
-Let's bet the bank.
-Pump 'em and dump 'em!

01:26:43.666 --> 01:26:45.368
(laughs)

01:26:48.904 --> 01:26:50.273
(beeping, buzzing)

01:26:58.914 --> 01:26:59.848
(chimes)

01:27:04.487 --> 01:27:06.522
Graham,
stop sexting yourself.

01:27:06.555 --> 01:27:09.958
I need you to work out
how many Honshu shares
I need to short

01:27:09.992 --> 01:27:12.628
so I can retire
before you lose your virginity.

01:27:12.661 --> 01:27:15.431
I want a personal
proprietary position on this.

01:27:16.399 --> 01:27:17.666
A really big one.

01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:33.516
I may need to ask you

01:27:33.549 --> 01:27:37.286
your collateralized
debt obligation.

01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:41.023
MAN:
* The best things
in life are free *

01:27:41.056 --> 01:27:44.059
* But you can keep 'em
for the birds and bees *

01:27:44.092 --> 01:27:47.663
* Now give me money
* That's what I want

01:27:47.696 --> 01:27:51.534
* That's what I want
* That's what I want

01:27:51.567 --> 01:27:56.372
* That's what I want, yeah
* That's what I want

01:27:56.405 --> 01:27:58.441
* That's what I want

01:28:00.008 --> 01:28:03.546
* Your loving
gives me a thrill *

01:28:03.579 --> 01:28:06.549
* But your loving
don't pay my bills *

01:28:06.582 --> 01:28:10.386
* Now give me money
* That's what I want

01:28:10.419 --> 01:28:14.056
* That's what I want
* That's what I want

01:28:14.089 --> 01:28:18.694
* That's what I want, yeah
* That's what I want

01:28:18.727 --> 01:28:20.295
* That's what I want

01:28:22.598 --> 01:28:26.068
* Money don't get everything
it's true *

01:28:26.101 --> 01:28:28.771
* But what it don't get
I can't use *

01:28:28.804 --> 01:28:32.575
* Now give me money
* That's what I want

01:28:32.608 --> 01:28:36.579
* That's what I want
* That's what I want

01:28:36.612 --> 01:28:41.384
* That's what I want, yeah
* That's what I want

01:28:41.417 --> 01:28:43.719
* That's what I want

01:28:43.752 --> 01:28:45.454
* Whoa, give me money

01:28:45.488 --> 01:28:47.456
* That's what I want

01:28:47.490 --> 01:28:49.024
* A whole lot of money

01:28:49.057 --> 01:28:51.794
* That's what I want

01:28:51.827 --> 01:28:56.098
* That's what I want
* Oh, yeah

01:28:56.131 --> 01:28:58.634
* That's what I want

01:29:01.136 --> 01:29:02.971
(beeping)

01:29:07.410 --> 01:29:09.044
(beeping continues)

01:29:11.514 --> 01:29:13.449
Let's just keep calm and hold.

01:29:52.855 --> 01:29:55.524
Now, Japanese banks
such as Honshu

01:29:55.558 --> 01:29:57.092
would normally announce
their results

01:29:57.125 --> 01:29:58.694
before the afternoon
trading session.

01:29:58.727 --> 01:30:02.164
That's around 4:30 a.m.
London time.

01:30:02.197 --> 01:30:04.066
To be frank,

01:30:04.099 --> 01:30:08.070
this kind of delay usually
signals only one thing--
serious trouble.

01:30:08.103 --> 01:30:11.073
Leading Tuftons analyst
Graham Seddon

01:30:11.106 --> 01:30:13.576
had been surprisingly bullish
about his prospects.

01:30:13.609 --> 01:30:15.844
Let's short sell
these babies. Come on!

01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:27.523
Right.
You're gonna sign, uh--

01:30:27.556 --> 01:30:29.124
Oh, boy.

01:30:29.157 --> 01:30:31.760
Waiter, do you have
a pen for the lady?

01:30:31.794 --> 01:30:35.163
OSCAR:
Oh, I'm so sorry,
madame. I don't.

01:30:35.197 --> 01:30:36.632
Give me a minute.

01:30:53.849 --> 01:30:55.684
When I went bust,

01:30:55.718 --> 01:30:58.787
Tuftons forced me
to sign over the shares
in my business.

01:30:58.821 --> 01:31:00.823
Apart from me wife
walking out on me,

01:31:00.856 --> 01:31:02.825
it was the hardest loss
of my life.

01:31:09.264 --> 01:31:11.834
Okay. Uh, here you go.

01:31:11.867 --> 01:31:14.770
All right, you're gonna
sign right here, my dear.

01:31:16.304 --> 01:31:19.575
MAN: Silence, please,
for our keynote speaker,

01:31:19.608 --> 01:31:24.647
CEO, Interglobal-Europe,
Richard Grinding.

01:31:27.783 --> 01:31:29.685
Thank you. Thanks.

01:31:29.718 --> 01:31:30.819
Wish me luck.

01:31:30.853 --> 01:31:33.756
(groans)

01:31:36.559 --> 01:31:39.294
This waiter has
a real sense of humor.
If he is a waiter.

01:31:39.327 --> 01:31:42.731
Ladies and gentlemen,
as you may have realized,

01:31:42.765 --> 01:31:44.633
I am not the keynote speaker.

01:31:44.667 --> 01:31:45.901
(sneezes)

01:31:45.934 --> 01:31:47.936
I am clearly not
the future of banking.

01:31:47.970 --> 01:31:49.738
MAN: This ought to be good.

01:31:49.772 --> 01:31:53.175
But I do have something
I'd like to say,
mostly to my wife.

01:31:53.208 --> 01:31:55.177
That makes the rest of you
collateral damage.

01:31:55.210 --> 01:31:56.645
RICHARD:
Have we signed yet?

01:31:56.679 --> 01:31:58.647
Oh, hi, Bel.

01:31:58.681 --> 01:31:59.982
PENELOPE:
What are you doing here?

01:32:00.015 --> 01:32:01.984
Supporting the family.

01:32:02.017 --> 01:32:05.921
For the first time in 20 years,
I have made a major decision.

01:32:05.954 --> 01:32:07.656
All by myself.

01:32:07.690 --> 01:32:11.293
Because it was on my watch
that Tuftons got into this...

01:32:12.595 --> 01:32:13.929
terrible muddle.

01:32:13.962 --> 01:32:15.230
Where's that pen?

01:32:15.263 --> 01:32:18.667
Tuftons should have stuck
to its knitting.

01:32:18.701 --> 01:32:21.203
I had no idea
what I was doing.

01:32:21.236 --> 01:32:24.940
Can you imagine
a brain surgeon
or an aircraft engineer

01:32:24.973 --> 01:32:26.609
admitting to
something like that?

01:32:26.642 --> 01:32:27.910
(sneezes)

01:32:27.943 --> 01:32:30.212
What on earth is
the matter with you?

01:32:30.245 --> 01:32:31.680
Did you find
that pen?

01:32:31.714 --> 01:32:35.317
Like so many others,
I too believed that...

01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:36.952
greed is good.

01:32:36.985 --> 01:32:39.622
Okay, let's get
some breaking news from Japan,

01:32:39.655 --> 01:32:42.791
where the results
from troubled Honshu
are about to be released.

01:32:42.825 --> 01:32:45.694
Oh, this is possibly
even worse than feared.

01:32:45.728 --> 01:32:47.963
These Honshu numbers
are truly horrible.

01:32:47.996 --> 01:32:51.233
To the boys
with the big balls,

01:32:51.266 --> 01:32:52.968
bring on the bonuses!

01:32:53.001 --> 01:32:55.003
(all cheering)

01:32:55.037 --> 01:32:58.306
CHARLES: I was seduced by egos
bigger than my own

01:32:58.340 --> 01:33:00.709
to enter
the Capitalist Casino,

01:33:00.743 --> 01:33:03.846
a pyramid Ponzi scheme
of collateralized
debt obligations,

01:33:03.879 --> 01:33:08.250
leveraged buyouts,
mortgage-backed securities,
special investment vehicles.

01:33:08.283 --> 01:33:11.887
You name 'em, we bought,
sold and repackaged them.

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:15.624
They were financial weapons
of mass destruction.

01:33:15.658 --> 01:33:18.393
Ordinary people
were sold products

01:33:18.426 --> 01:33:20.863
they neither
understood nor needed.

01:33:20.896 --> 01:33:25.033
As Kierkegaard said,
"Life must be lived forwards,

01:33:25.067 --> 01:33:28.937
but can only be
truly understood backwards."

01:33:28.971 --> 01:33:30.372
And so today...

01:33:33.341 --> 01:33:35.744
I do understand.

01:33:35.778 --> 01:33:37.646
I don't wanna listen
to this anymore.

01:33:40.448 --> 01:33:43.986
It was our crazy
compensation culture
that drove us over the cliff.

01:33:44.019 --> 01:33:46.755
Our bonuses were based
upon short-term results,

01:33:46.789 --> 01:33:48.691
not our performance
in the long haul.

01:33:48.724 --> 01:33:50.659
(whines)
(sneezes)

01:33:51.794 --> 01:33:53.428
Uh, Nick--
Yes.

01:33:53.461 --> 01:33:57.432
Have you had a chance
to look at the Honshu report?

01:33:57.465 --> 01:34:01.303
It's just
that the, uh, share price
is at 7.70 again.

01:34:01.336 --> 01:34:03.305
Speculators, mate.
Don't worry about it.

01:34:03.338 --> 01:34:04.907
According to
our computer model,

01:34:04.940 --> 01:34:07.442
that can only happen
once in a million years.

01:34:07.475 --> 01:34:08.844
Right.

01:34:08.877 --> 01:34:12.681
I just think it might
be happening right now.

01:34:15.918 --> 01:34:18.320
There's a twist
in the tale,

01:34:18.353 --> 01:34:19.755
because according
to official sources,

01:34:19.788 --> 01:34:24.126
the Japanese government
intends to take over
this venerable institution,

01:34:24.159 --> 01:34:26.094
in effect nationalizing it,

01:34:26.128 --> 01:34:28.897
to secure
its long-term future.

01:34:31.099 --> 01:34:33.869
(cell phone buzzing, beeping)

01:34:33.902 --> 01:34:38.473
We had no thought or feeling
for anyone but ourselves.

01:34:38.506 --> 01:34:41.810
So I and my colleagues

01:34:41.844 --> 01:34:45.080
kept every one of the bonuses,

01:34:45.113 --> 01:34:46.982
leaving only the innocent,
RICHARD: Be quiet.

01:34:47.015 --> 01:34:50.118
the honest and the ethical...

01:34:51.386 --> 01:34:52.921
to pay.

01:34:52.955 --> 01:34:55.724
How clever is that?

01:34:57.793 --> 01:34:59.962
The keynote speaker
has arrived.

01:35:00.996 --> 01:35:02.965
We have
to buy Honshu stock.

01:35:02.998 --> 01:35:04.800
It's soaring.

01:35:04.833 --> 01:35:07.836
Our contract binds us
to sell it at £8 per share,

01:35:07.870 --> 01:35:10.739
and it's already worth 12.

01:35:10.773 --> 01:35:14.042
Which means we've lost
close to a... billion.

01:35:14.076 --> 01:35:15.377
And it's getting worse.

01:35:15.410 --> 01:35:18.513
Don't panic.
Don't... panic.

01:35:18.546 --> 01:35:19.748
The stock's
gonna plummet.

01:35:19.782 --> 01:35:23.118
Remember, if you can stay calm
whilst all around you is chaos--

01:35:23.151 --> 01:35:25.420
Then you've clearly
underestimated

01:35:25.453 --> 01:35:27.823
the seriousness
of the situation.

01:35:27.856 --> 01:35:31.894
Interglobal didn't happen
to have a proprietary position
in Honshu by any chance?

01:35:31.927 --> 01:35:33.128
What?

01:35:33.161 --> 01:35:35.898
Because it looks as if
it might have just...

01:35:35.931 --> 01:35:37.933
broken your bank.

01:35:37.966 --> 01:35:39.034
You're lying.

01:35:40.836 --> 01:35:42.771
It now looks
as though Interglobal's

01:35:42.805 --> 01:35:46.041
suspected aggressive shorting
of Honshu stock

01:35:46.074 --> 01:35:50.078
could prove ruinous
for the US giant.

01:35:50.112 --> 01:35:51.880
It seems almost certain

01:35:51.914 --> 01:35:55.884
that Interglobal's share price
will be hammered.

01:35:58.586 --> 01:36:01.423
It looks like
that offer of yours
for my wife's shares

01:36:01.456 --> 01:36:03.025
might just be
completely worthless.

01:36:03.892 --> 01:36:05.493
Ignore him, Penelope.

01:36:05.527 --> 01:36:08.030
-I usually do.
-(groans)

01:36:08.063 --> 01:36:10.498
Why is it going up?

01:36:10.532 --> 01:36:13.001
What?
I thought you might
wanna take a look at this.

01:36:14.602 --> 01:36:16.872
Ooh, look
at our share price.

01:36:16.905 --> 01:36:18.406
It's done a--

01:36:20.175 --> 01:36:21.810
Bunbury.

01:36:28.283 --> 01:36:30.986
Nick.

01:36:31.019 --> 01:36:35.223
For investors,
that spike in the share price
now looks like wishful thinking.

01:36:36.859 --> 01:36:37.993
Bollocks.

01:36:39.494 --> 01:36:41.463
Ichiban,
Nakamura-san!

01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:47.102
We played the game.

01:36:48.236 --> 01:36:50.272
To most of us,
it was just a game,

01:36:50.305 --> 01:36:52.440
where our money
was the score.

01:36:54.642 --> 01:36:59.047
We refused to see
the damage Wall Street
was inflicting on Main Street.

01:37:01.283 --> 01:37:03.118
We were blinded by--

01:37:06.654 --> 01:37:10.125
I was blinded by greed.

01:37:11.994 --> 01:37:15.230
And as a consequence,
I wrecked many lives,
including my own.

01:37:17.032 --> 01:37:18.867
And I broke the bank--

01:37:21.269 --> 01:37:23.138
our bank--

01:37:25.007 --> 01:37:28.176
that had been a force
for good for 200 years.

01:37:29.945 --> 01:37:31.179
And for that...

01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:34.549
I kneel here today...

01:37:37.552 --> 01:37:42.157
and ask you, Penny,

01:37:42.190 --> 01:37:44.126
for your forgiveness.

01:37:49.564 --> 01:37:51.133
I'll think about it.

01:37:51.166 --> 01:37:54.002
-Sorry?
-Possibly.

01:37:54.036 --> 01:37:56.338
But I'm not saying
I'll definitely take you back.

01:37:56.371 --> 01:37:58.240
Who said anything a--

01:37:59.574 --> 01:38:01.576
Who said anything
about wanting you back?

01:38:45.153 --> 01:38:46.621
(clears throat)

01:38:49.224 --> 01:38:51.059
I've got
a tip for you.

01:38:51.093 --> 01:38:52.660
Nurgistan Gas.

01:38:52.694 --> 01:38:55.097
It's going to be
a recovery player.

01:38:57.032 --> 01:38:58.366
Buy!

01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:00.102
Bye.

01:39:01.369 --> 01:39:04.172
Oh, my God!
It's going up!

01:39:04.206 --> 01:39:06.074
I do believe it is.

01:39:19.154 --> 01:39:20.989
To Tuftons

01:39:21.023 --> 01:39:22.657
and the next 200!

01:39:22.690 --> 01:39:25.160
ALL: The next 200!

01:39:27.062 --> 01:39:31.099
-Annabel is here with him.
-You can say his name.

01:39:31.133 --> 01:39:33.401
I can't. It's stupid.
If they have children,
they'll be Twiglets.

01:39:33.435 --> 01:39:36.438
Mum, you remember Twig.

01:39:36.471 --> 01:39:38.073
Top up, Mrs. B.?

01:39:40.342 --> 01:39:42.277
Was that so hard?
You have no idea.

01:39:44.146 --> 01:39:46.081
Wiff waff, Charles-san?

01:39:46.114 --> 01:39:48.350
Oh, I would love to,
Nakamura-san,

01:39:48.383 --> 01:39:52.187
but I promised Penelope
that I would learn bridge.

01:39:52.220 --> 01:39:55.057
Thank God for that.
The last time we played

01:39:55.090 --> 01:39:59.261
the only time I ever knew
what was in your hand
was when you were in the loo.

01:39:59.294 --> 01:40:02.197
Annabel, have I ever told you
that throughout our marriage

01:40:02.230 --> 01:40:06.234
your mother
has always been there
when she needed me?

01:40:06.268 --> 01:40:08.470
PENELOPE: You know what
they also say, Annabel:

01:40:08.503 --> 01:40:12.107
behind every successful man
is an astonished woman.

01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:16.044
CHARLES:
Yes, even the blind hog
finds a truffle sometimes.

01:40:16.078 --> 01:40:20.115
Will you just be quiet.
PENELOPE: No.

01:40:20.148 --> 01:40:22.384
MAN:
* Grow old with me

01:40:22.417 --> 01:40:25.320
* Let us share what we see

01:40:25.353 --> 01:40:28.356
* And oh the best it could be

01:40:28.390 --> 01:40:30.092
* Just you and I

01:40:30.125 --> 01:40:32.460
** (chorus vocalizing)

01:40:35.730 --> 01:40:39.067
* And our hands they might age

01:40:39.101 --> 01:40:42.337
* And our bodies will change

01:40:42.370 --> 01:40:45.340
* But we'll still be the same

01:40:45.373 --> 01:40:47.109
* As we are

01:40:48.543 --> 01:40:52.314
* We'll still sing our song

01:40:52.347 --> 01:40:55.350
* When our hair
ain't so blond *

01:40:55.383 --> 01:40:58.453
* And our children have sung

01:40:58.486 --> 01:41:00.288
* We were right

01:41:02.190 --> 01:41:05.193
* They'll sing
grow old with me *

01:41:05.227 --> 01:41:08.296
* Let us share what we see

01:41:08.330 --> 01:41:11.333
* And all the best it could be

01:41:11.366 --> 01:41:13.768
* Just you and I

01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:21.743
* And the hairs they stand up

01:41:21.776 --> 01:41:24.879
* And my feet start to thump

01:41:24.912 --> 01:41:29.817
* Yet the feeling
is dreaming around *

01:41:31.786 --> 01:41:34.856
* You'll be the one

01:41:34.889 --> 01:41:39.527
* Make me feel
like I'm real and alive *

01:41:41.929 --> 01:41:44.532
* Grow old with me

01:41:44.566 --> 01:41:47.769
* Let us share what we see

01:41:47.802 --> 01:41:50.538
* And all the best it could be

01:41:50.572 --> 01:41:53.141
* Just you and I

01:41:55.210 --> 01:41:57.779
* Grow old with me

01:41:57.812 --> 01:42:00.815
* Let us share what we see

01:42:00.848 --> 01:42:03.918
* And all the best it could be

01:42:03.951 --> 01:42:06.388
* Just you and I

01:42:16.364 --> 01:42:18.366
