WEBVTT

00:10.308 --> 00:13.141
(static crackles)

00:22.669 --> 00:26.918
- [Voiceover] I don't know
exactly how to start this.

00:26.918 --> 00:29.280
But I knew after I found this footage,

00:29.280 --> 00:31.881
I had to share it with everyone.

00:31.881 --> 00:34.462
In some type of effort to
try and better understand

00:34.462 --> 00:36.545
what happened in my life.

00:37.510 --> 00:40.169
Someone very close to me did something

00:40.169 --> 00:43.919
that still leaves me
and my family horrified.

00:45.392 --> 00:48.169
I found this footage in returned items

00:48.169 --> 00:52.240
after the police had completed
their initial investigation.

00:52.240 --> 00:54.390
From there, I decided that I would try

00:54.390 --> 00:56.896
to piece together in some
form of sequence of events.

00:56.896 --> 00:59.901
What you're about to
see is compiled footage

00:59.901 --> 01:03.138
of the events that happened as it leads up

01:03.138 --> 01:05.221
on the night in question.

01:07.742 --> 01:09.945
You see, no one knows exactly why,

01:09.945 --> 01:12.112
even how, it could happen.

01:14.161 --> 01:16.630
I will never understand why they chose

01:16.630 --> 01:20.718
to go into a place that
was known to be haunted.

01:20.718 --> 01:23.566
The Lafitte Plantation
in Vacherie, Lousiana

01:23.566 --> 01:26.895
is a place you don't play with.

01:26.895 --> 01:28.312
They knew better.

01:29.345 --> 01:31.928
(creepy music)

01:51.888 --> 01:53.546
- [Voiceover] Hi--
- [Swinging Woman] Hey.

01:53.546 --> 01:55.776
- My name is Anna and
I'm with the University

01:55.776 --> 01:58.348
of Southern Louisiana and
I'm kind of going around

01:58.348 --> 02:01.695
asking people what they know
about the Lafitte Plantation.

02:01.695 --> 02:02.791
- The what?

02:02.791 --> 02:05.307
- [Voiceover] The Lafitte Plantation?

02:05.307 --> 02:08.173
- Oh, you talkin' about that
old house on Route Seven?

02:08.173 --> 02:10.757
- [Voiceover] Yes, I heard it was haunted.

02:10.757 --> 02:11.656
(chuckling)

02:11.656 --> 02:13.879
- I don't want to be rude,
ma'am, but I don't even

02:13.879 --> 02:15.784
want to talk about the place.

02:15.784 --> 02:17.360
- [Voiceover] Local says
that it's still haunted

02:17.360 --> 02:18.478
and things like that.

02:18.478 --> 02:19.531
- Is it, or?

02:19.531 --> 02:21.475
- [Voiceover] I don't know, but, I mean,

02:21.475 --> 02:23.229
a few people have said it is, so.

02:23.229 --> 02:25.135
- Well, believe what you
hear, because it is haunted.

02:25.135 --> 02:26.326
- Nah, I don't believe
in none of that shit,

02:26.326 --> 02:27.428
I don't believe in none of that ghosts

02:27.428 --> 02:28.644
and spirits, anything like that.

02:28.644 --> 02:30.859
- My mother told us stories
about that place, growing up,

02:30.859 --> 02:34.231
and the hair stands up on my arms

02:34.231 --> 02:35.762
when we talk about that place.

02:35.762 --> 02:36.885
- I've heard things.

02:36.885 --> 02:40.098
Actually, I've heard a lot of things.

02:40.098 --> 02:41.897
- [Voiceover] Okay,
would you mind explaining

02:41.897 --> 02:43.125
or going into detail?

02:43.125 --> 02:44.528
- Sure.

02:44.528 --> 02:48.695
When it was a bed and
breakfast, I know that a lot

02:49.732 --> 02:53.586
of people reported seeing
in one of the bedrooms

02:53.586 --> 02:57.068
that children would jump
and down on the bed,

02:57.068 --> 03:00.651
or pull the toes of
whoever was in the bed.

03:02.170 --> 03:03.776
- I used to be a maid there, a nanny,

03:03.776 --> 03:05.616
whatever you want to call it,

03:05.616 --> 03:07.638
and I used to take care
of the family there.

03:07.638 --> 03:09.804
But they didn't stay very
long, they moved out.

03:09.804 --> 03:11.257
- [Voiceover] Well, why, what happened?

03:11.257 --> 03:14.276
- Like, stuff started to move
around, stuff was missing.

03:14.276 --> 03:17.953
I'd be dusting around and
there was pennies all over

03:17.953 --> 03:19.566
the place like somebody had threw

03:19.566 --> 03:21.235
it there in different rooms.

03:21.235 --> 03:22.648
Even if people weren't there,

03:22.648 --> 03:24.408
they just would appear.

03:24.408 --> 03:26.220
Lady floating around, no feet.

03:26.220 --> 03:28.418
Horses trotting outside,
you go look out the window,

03:28.418 --> 03:29.731
there's nothing there.

03:29.731 --> 03:31.928
- There are ghostly spirits walking,

03:31.928 --> 03:33.690
roaming the property.

03:33.690 --> 03:36.255
You have family members of the plantation,

03:36.255 --> 03:39.443
Lafitte Plantation, who
owned the home, died there

03:39.443 --> 03:41.809
and their spirits, their
ghost spirits are walking

03:41.809 --> 03:44.503
around in the property.

03:44.503 --> 03:48.191
Especially, this one lady
who appears out the window

03:48.191 --> 03:50.399
all the time, she's
wearing this white dress,

03:50.399 --> 03:52.639
a really young lady.

03:52.639 --> 03:56.306
- Um, Confederate
soldiers were killed there

03:57.761 --> 04:01.928
and it's reported that they
still haunt the grounds.

04:04.125 --> 04:06.073
I know that there was a thief

04:06.073 --> 04:09.479
that was killed on the 11th step

04:09.479 --> 04:12.606
and when people go up
and down the staircase,

04:12.606 --> 04:15.060
sometimes, they're tripped
for no apparent reason.

04:15.060 --> 04:16.810
- [Voiceover] Really?

04:17.839 --> 04:21.339
- And, in the dining room, there's a woman

04:23.606 --> 04:27.773
that is dressed in white
and she goes back and forth

04:28.831 --> 04:30.586
across the dining room.

04:30.586 --> 04:32.496
- [Voiceover] A woman in white?

04:32.496 --> 04:33.329
- Yes.

04:34.744 --> 04:36.969
- [Voiceover] Do you know who she is?

04:36.969 --> 04:39.858
- I think she was one
of the original owners

04:39.858 --> 04:42.691
or related to the original owners.

04:45.401 --> 04:47.544
- [Voiceover] Okay, thank you so much.

04:47.544 --> 04:51.079
- But I know, I think there
was a painting that hung

04:51.079 --> 04:54.246
above the fireplace or mantle, of her.

04:55.966 --> 04:57.880
- [Voiceover] Ma'am, thank you so much,

04:57.880 --> 05:00.713
this information's really helpful.

05:04.844 --> 05:07.974
- [Voiceover] Well, look at the light.

05:07.974 --> 05:11.317
- [Voiceover] Okay, I
still don't see anything.

05:11.317 --> 05:15.400
- Oh, if you flip the
little shutter thing, then,

05:18.448 --> 05:19.856
- Girl, you know I'm crazy.

05:19.856 --> 05:21.096
- You will be able to see.

05:21.096 --> 05:21.929
Yes, you are.

05:21.929 --> 05:23.024
Wait, so when did you get this?

05:23.024 --> 05:24.300
- I got it the other day.

05:24.300 --> 05:25.260
You know I didn't want to,

05:25.260 --> 05:26.592
but I have to pass this class, so.

05:26.592 --> 05:28.342
- [Voiceover] Mmmhmm.

05:29.695 --> 05:32.728
- Wait, is that the one with
the first mechanic in it?

05:32.728 --> 05:33.915
- [Voiceover] No, actually,
this is the one I got

05:33.915 --> 05:34.978
from the lab.

05:34.978 --> 05:36.114
- [Voiceover] Oh.

05:36.114 --> 05:37.161
- [Voiceover] Anyways, I'm hungry,

05:37.161 --> 05:38.344
you want something to eat?

05:38.344 --> 05:41.617
- [Voiceover] Yeah, um,
yes. What do you have?

05:41.617 --> 05:42.870
- [Voiceover] Pizza!

05:42.870 --> 05:43.703
- [Voiceover] Okay.

05:43.703 --> 05:45.970
- [Voiceover] Pizza

05:45.970 --> 05:48.556
- [Voiceover] All right, tell me what's up

05:48.556 --> 05:50.622
with you and Gavin.

05:50.622 --> 05:52.575
- Damn, we haven't even eaten yet,

05:52.575 --> 05:53.583
and you're gonna start this.

05:53.583 --> 05:54.981
What do you mean what's
up with me and Gavin?

05:54.981 --> 05:57.292
Nothing's up, we are together.

05:57.292 --> 06:00.165
- [Voiceover] Well, I
knew that, but I thought

06:00.165 --> 06:01.627
he was just a rebound.

06:01.627 --> 06:02.906
- What?

06:02.906 --> 06:04.458
Girl, I don't do rebounds, okay?

06:04.458 --> 06:07.367
I like him, he's funny,
he's tall, he's handsome,

06:07.367 --> 06:08.624
he treats me nice.

06:08.624 --> 06:09.905
- [Voiceover] Yeah, uh-huh, you know what?

06:09.905 --> 06:11.488
But he isn't Jonah.

06:12.611 --> 06:13.967
- Exactly, he's Gavin.

06:13.967 --> 06:16.185
He's hot, handsome and he has a big ass --

06:16.185 --> 06:18.183
- [Voiceover] Oh, my God.

06:18.183 --> 06:19.508
(laughter)

06:19.508 --> 06:20.406
Oh, my God.

06:20.406 --> 06:23.489
Okay, wait, wait. No, TMI, all right.

06:24.792 --> 06:28.225
- Um, did she sound kind
of weird on the phone?

06:28.225 --> 06:31.134
'Cause, like, when I
talked with the caretaker,

06:31.134 --> 06:32.583
I don't know, he just
kind of gave me the creeps

06:32.583 --> 06:33.503
a little bit.

06:33.503 --> 06:35.005
- Yeah, 'cause caretakers are creepy.

06:35.005 --> 06:35.902
(laughter)

06:35.902 --> 06:37.764
With the keys and

06:37.764 --> 06:40.480
cutting grass late at night.

06:40.480 --> 06:43.597
- Sitting around at
midnight just hanging round.

06:43.597 --> 06:45.458
- No, she seemed okay,
but that's just people

06:45.458 --> 06:48.218
from back home, we just don't talk

06:48.218 --> 06:50.359
about the Lafitte Plantation.

06:50.359 --> 06:51.734
It's like, hear no evil.

06:51.734 --> 06:54.567
(speaking Creole)

06:55.408 --> 06:59.027
- Well, I know French, so we will see

06:59.027 --> 07:01.268
if we see anything.

07:01.268 --> 07:03.153
- We will see.

07:03.153 --> 07:05.286
- [Voiceover] All right,
'cause I'm gonna try and see

07:05.286 --> 07:06.261
what we can...

07:06.261 --> 07:07.928
Oh, it's already on.

07:10.500 --> 07:12.653
- You said that thing was on?

07:12.653 --> 07:13.665
This camera?

07:13.665 --> 07:15.602
- [Voiceover] Yeah, uh huh.

07:15.602 --> 07:16.596
- Bring me this camera.

07:16.596 --> 07:21.204
- [Voiceover] Listen, I
have a paper due next week

07:21.204 --> 07:23.677
and I was going to ask
you to write it for me.

07:23.677 --> 07:24.602
But now, I'm going to make you write it--

07:24.602 --> 07:26.836
- Anna, you better delete
that before anyone --

07:26.836 --> 07:29.611
I am not playing with you.

07:29.611 --> 07:30.755
(phone ringing)

07:30.755 --> 07:34.543
You know what? You're lucky
this phone is ringing.

07:34.543 --> 07:35.793
Hello? Hey, ma.

07:37.106 --> 07:38.156
Don't start with all that stuff, okay?

07:38.156 --> 07:39.797
Nothin' is gonna happen.

07:39.797 --> 07:41.429
We're gonna spend the night filming,

07:41.429 --> 07:44.730
we'll be over to your
house to eat the next day,

07:44.730 --> 07:46.886
and everything will be fine.

07:46.886 --> 07:49.187
Okay, mom, look, all you
have to worry about doing

07:49.187 --> 07:50.418
is making me some pecan pie

07:50.418 --> 07:52.305
because I've been craving a slice.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.013
- And me, gotta make sure I get some too.

07:54.013 --> 07:55.286
- Okay, love you too, bye.

07:55.286 --> 07:56.119
Lord.

07:57.086 --> 07:58.468
- What was that about?

07:58.468 --> 07:59.578
- I don't know, I told you.

07:59.578 --> 08:00.700
People from back home,
they don't like to talk

08:00.700 --> 08:02.261
about the Lafitte Plantation
unless they telling

08:02.261 --> 08:04.432
you stay away from it.

08:04.432 --> 08:05.864
- Is it really that serious?

08:05.864 --> 08:07.047
- I don't think it's that serious,

08:07.047 --> 08:08.795
but it's always somebody
that knows somebody

08:08.795 --> 08:10.466
that knows somebody that went in

08:10.466 --> 08:11.838
and never came back.

08:11.838 --> 08:13.812
- Yeah, okay.
- [Anna] Whatever

08:13.812 --> 08:16.733
- But my family, they always
been weird about that place.

08:16.733 --> 08:19.867
My grandmother, she even
forbid us to talk about it.

08:19.867 --> 08:23.126
- Well, didn't that make
you kind of want to know

08:23.126 --> 08:25.024
what was in it and stuff like that?

08:25.024 --> 08:26.377
- Hell no!

08:26.377 --> 08:30.544
That place is eerie lookin',
I just stayed away from it.

08:31.790 --> 08:35.183
- That makes me even more curious, now.

08:35.183 --> 08:39.068
- [Voiceover] I saw
you in the choir today.

08:39.068 --> 08:40.280
- [Voiceover] Of course you didn't,

08:40.280 --> 08:41.344
that was a trick question.

08:41.344 --> 08:42.667
(laughter)

08:42.667 --> 08:43.842
- [Voiceover] You ever get stuck talkin'

08:43.842 --> 08:45.209
to like a group of freshmen?

08:45.209 --> 08:46.477
- [Voiceover] Oh, nice.

08:46.477 --> 08:47.665
- [Voiceover] Lucky dog.

08:47.665 --> 08:49.721
- [Voiceover] Freshmen.

08:49.721 --> 08:51.554
- [Voiceover] Hey, Ky.

08:53.690 --> 08:55.765
Hi, oh, I probably shouldn't
be doing that, sorry.

08:55.765 --> 08:56.844
- [Voiceover] What are you doing?

08:56.844 --> 08:57.898
- [Voiceover] Trying to figure it out,

08:57.898 --> 09:01.607
there's like some buttons
I can't understand

09:01.607 --> 09:02.547
- [Voiceover] Here, just give it to me.

09:02.547 --> 09:03.630
- [Voiceover] It's hard.

09:03.630 --> 09:06.316
- [Voiceover] That's what she said.

09:06.316 --> 09:07.454
- [Voiceover] Oh my God!

09:07.454 --> 09:08.445
- [Voiceover] Only because
you can't get anything

09:08.445 --> 09:09.363
before anyone, ever.

09:09.363 --> 09:10.475
- [Voiceover] Really?

09:10.475 --> 09:12.447
- Yeah, we got the 15
minute rule, starting now.

09:12.447 --> 09:13.434
- [Girl In White Shirt] All right.

09:13.434 --> 09:14.267
- [Voiceover] Starting now?

09:14.267 --> 09:15.179
He's already 10 minutes late.

09:15.179 --> 09:16.393
- Okay, we've got five more minutes then.

09:16.393 --> 09:17.455
- [Voiceover] Thank you.

09:17.455 --> 09:18.288
- [Boy In Blue Shirt] No, let's go now.

09:18.288 --> 09:19.121
- [Boy In Striped Shirt]
I'm ready to leave.

09:19.121 --> 09:20.752
- Me and Anna go by the 15 minute rule.

09:20.752 --> 09:23.919
(overlapping chatter)

09:28.264 --> 09:31.211
(door slamming)

09:31.211 --> 09:32.429
- Now we've got a quiz.

09:32.429 --> 09:33.262
- [Voiceover] She would probably die

09:33.262 --> 09:34.095
if she failed the class.

09:34.095 --> 09:35.451
- Okay, guys, okay.

09:35.451 --> 09:37.342
Let's get started.

09:37.342 --> 09:38.694
- [Voiceover] Damn it.

09:38.694 --> 09:40.691
- Jonah, what are you
doing with the camera?

09:40.691 --> 09:41.730
- [Jonah] Nothing.

09:41.730 --> 09:44.263
(laughter)

09:44.263 --> 09:46.410
It's sort of our project.

09:46.410 --> 09:49.932
- Okay, well, speaking of
which, what is your project?

09:49.932 --> 09:51.629
- [Voiceover] We're doing a documentary.

09:51.629 --> 09:53.379
- Uh, about teaching?

09:54.490 --> 09:56.664
(laughter)

09:56.664 --> 09:58.298
- [Voiceover] Uh, as
interesting as that may sound,

09:58.298 --> 09:59.807
not quite.

09:59.807 --> 10:01.720
Now, we want you to keep an open mind.

10:01.720 --> 10:02.854
We want to do something different,

10:02.854 --> 10:04.316
so we're gonna do a documentary

10:04.316 --> 10:06.976
on an abandoned plantation.

10:06.976 --> 10:07.990
- Really?

10:07.990 --> 10:10.714
And how exactly is that going to work?

10:10.714 --> 10:12.120
- [Voiceover] Well, we're
going to use the abandoned

10:12.120 --> 10:13.383
Lafitte Plantation in Vackery--

10:13.383 --> 10:17.191
- [Voiceover] Vacherie, it's
Vacherie, no, he said it,

10:17.191 --> 10:19.478
no, I'm sorry, he said it
wrong two times in a row.

10:19.478 --> 10:20.385
- [Voiceover] Excuse me--
- I can't let it go.

10:20.385 --> 10:21.218
- [Voiceover] I'm always wrong.

10:21.218 --> 10:22.051
- It's Vacherie, Louisiana.

10:22.051 --> 10:23.143
- [Voiceover] What do
you care what I think?

10:23.143 --> 10:25.368
- I'm just telling you to
say it right, Vacherie.

10:25.368 --> 10:26.828
- [Voiceover] Oh, excuse me, Miss Correct.

10:26.828 --> 10:28.790
- I'm always correct, but I'm from there.

10:28.790 --> 10:30.780
- [Voiceover] Really,
oh, I'm sorry, my bad.

10:30.780 --> 10:32.672
Same old shit that--
- [Professor] Okay, okay.

10:32.672 --> 10:34.455
- Everybody in class: Vacherie.

10:34.455 --> 10:37.784
- Everyone, what makes
this place so special?

10:37.784 --> 10:40.143
I mean, is there a story behind this?

10:40.143 --> 10:42.269
- Hell yeah, there's a story to be told.

10:42.269 --> 10:44.555
It's a plantation, it's
haunted, and I'm black,

10:44.555 --> 10:45.844
so there's three reasons
I don't see why the fuck

10:45.844 --> 10:47.187
I should be going.

10:47.187 --> 10:48.703
(laughter)

10:48.703 --> 10:51.208
(overlapping chatter)

10:51.208 --> 10:53.211
- Well, I'm not scared.

10:53.211 --> 10:55.355
- Well, Misty, you should be because

10:55.355 --> 10:57.728
if you don't get the extra
credit needed from this,

10:57.728 --> 10:59.269
you won't graduate.

10:59.269 --> 11:00.102
(class groaning)

11:00.102 --> 11:01.795
- [Voiceover] Oh, snap!

11:01.795 --> 11:04.759
- [Misty] Oh, yes, I will.

11:04.759 --> 11:06.956
- [Professor] Same thing goes for you, Ky.

11:06.956 --> 11:08.457
- [Ky] Why you gotta call me out?

11:08.457 --> 11:09.671
- [Anna] Because it's true, dude.

11:09.671 --> 11:11.753
- [Ky] Whatever, Anna.

11:11.753 --> 11:12.843
- Look, anyway--

11:12.843 --> 11:13.676
(laughter)

11:13.676 --> 11:15.183
Anyway, I'm gonna ask this again.

11:15.183 --> 11:17.222
What makes this place so special?

11:17.222 --> 11:18.839
Genevieve, you're pretty talkative--

11:18.839 --> 11:19.770
- [Genevieve] Yeah.

11:19.770 --> 11:21.323
- What do you have to say about it?

11:21.323 --> 11:22.400
- It's the wonderful cameraman back there

11:22.400 --> 11:24.492
that's just drilling it out of me today.

11:24.492 --> 11:26.662
- [Voiceover] Not the first time.

11:26.662 --> 11:28.276
- [Voiceover] Are they still together?

11:28.276 --> 11:30.100
- [Genevieve] I think
it's a great project.

11:30.100 --> 11:31.955
It talks about a woman who, uh--

11:31.955 --> 11:33.945
- [Voiceover] Wait a
minute, wait, wait, wait.

11:33.945 --> 11:35.753
Professor, if we tell you everything now,

11:35.753 --> 11:38.010
what's the point of us actually
making this documentary?

11:38.010 --> 11:39.797
Can we at least keep some things a mystery

11:39.797 --> 11:40.797
about this project?

11:40.797 --> 11:42.248
- Yeah, well, it's a big mystery

11:42.248 --> 11:44.119
if you're gonna pass this class.

11:44.119 --> 11:45.550
(class groaning)

11:45.550 --> 11:46.857
- [Voiceover] Burn!

11:46.857 --> 11:48.306
- [Voiceover] Look, I'm
just saying, I really do

11:48.306 --> 11:50.113
love telling a story through the lens.

11:50.113 --> 11:51.447
- Dude, Ky!

11:51.447 --> 11:53.602
Porn doesn't really tell much of a story.

11:53.602 --> 11:55.852
(laughter)

11:57.458 --> 11:59.297
- Especially when he makes up his own.

11:59.297 --> 12:01.344
- [Voiceover] Seriously,
guys, seriously guys, come on.

12:01.344 --> 12:03.738
Professor, professor, it's gonna be great.

12:03.738 --> 12:05.953
It's a great story and it just
needs to be told, that's all.

12:05.953 --> 12:06.848
Whatever.

12:06.848 --> 12:08.722
- Okay, well
- [Ky] You guys can be dicks.

12:08.722 --> 12:11.275
- I'm not going to push you guys anymore,

12:11.275 --> 12:14.453
I just want to make sure
have some good direction.

12:14.453 --> 12:16.114
Now, let's talk about the time frame.

12:16.114 --> 12:18.163
I have my colleague, Charles,

12:18.163 --> 12:21.949
he's gonna engineer all the
projects for my film classes.

12:21.949 --> 12:22.782
- [Ky] Charles?

12:22.782 --> 12:26.073
Is that the prick who
almost cost me my midterm?

12:26.073 --> 12:28.730
- [Professor] Well, as I
remember, Ky, you're the prick

12:28.730 --> 12:30.011
who showed up late for the shoot.

12:30.011 --> 12:32.304
- [Ky] Whatever, man, he sucks anyways.

12:32.304 --> 12:34.517
- [Genevieve] Please don't
be on time this time.

12:34.517 --> 12:36.195
- Well, you better hope not,
because you need this grade

12:36.195 --> 12:37.520
to graduate.

12:37.520 --> 12:39.872
Now, when are you filming?

12:39.872 --> 12:41.962
- Uh, we are filming, what
did I do with my calendar?

12:41.962 --> 12:45.212
We are filming next
weekend, Saturday morning.

12:45.212 --> 12:47.295
- [Voiceover] Can't wait.

12:48.197 --> 12:51.296
- Okay, that works out,
that works out perfect.

12:51.296 --> 12:53.044
I'll give him a call, make
sure he meets you guys

12:53.044 --> 12:54.711
on Saturday morning.

12:55.819 --> 12:58.617
- [Genevieve] Prof, can
we go early today, please?

12:58.617 --> 12:59.848
We did everything.

12:59.848 --> 13:02.148
- Absolutely, you guys have
been wonderful, good luck.

13:02.148 --> 13:04.981
I think you're gonna do fantastic.

13:07.220 --> 13:11.276
- [Voiceover] So, how does
Gavin feel about having

13:11.276 --> 13:13.752
to work on the project with Jonah?

13:13.752 --> 13:18.148
- Okay, okay, not that I care,
but I think it bothers him

13:18.148 --> 13:20.779
to be around Jonah any
longer than he has to.

13:20.779 --> 13:22.707
I mean, that's my ex-boyfriend.

13:22.707 --> 13:25.371
- [Voiceover] Well, I mean,
I guess I'll just have

13:25.371 --> 13:28.038
to accept that Jonah's your past

13:29.354 --> 13:32.031
and Gavin's your present, I guess.

13:32.031 --> 13:34.258
- Let me tell you, the real
problem with me and Jonah

13:34.258 --> 13:36.919
is that Jonah always wanted
to graduate from college,

13:36.919 --> 13:39.145
and be this big-time director in LA.

13:39.145 --> 13:43.022
And me, I'm an LA girl,
all right, as in Louisiana.

13:43.022 --> 13:45.152
So I got mad at myself about
where things were headed

13:45.152 --> 13:47.632
and we had to end it
before it got too serious.

13:47.632 --> 13:49.000
(computer keys clicking)

13:49.000 --> 13:49.936
Anna, you not paying attention to me,

13:49.936 --> 13:51.428
you asking me all these questions.

13:51.428 --> 13:52.409
- [Voiceover] No, I am.

13:52.409 --> 13:53.269
- Okay.

13:53.269 --> 13:55.830
- [Voiceover] Here,
look, here's the website

13:55.830 --> 13:58.830
that shows the place we're going to.

14:00.763 --> 14:02.329
- [Genevieve] Told you it was scary.

14:02.329 --> 14:04.935
- [Anna] Scary and haunted are like

14:04.935 --> 14:06.397
two totally different things.

14:06.397 --> 14:07.974
- Okay, we're gonna see about that.

14:07.974 --> 14:09.935
I want to hear you say that
when we get to that place.

14:09.935 --> 14:11.533
Tell me if you--

14:11.533 --> 14:12.366
- [Gavin] Hi, babe, ready to go?

14:12.366 --> 14:13.218
- [Genevieve] Hey, babe.

14:13.218 --> 14:14.185
- Hey, there Anna, what's up?

14:14.185 --> 14:15.018
- [Anna] Hey.

14:15.018 --> 14:15.851
- What y'all doin?

14:15.851 --> 14:17.483
- Nothing, work, what you doing?

14:17.483 --> 14:18.534
- Chillin'.

14:18.534 --> 14:19.367
- Yeah.

14:19.367 --> 14:20.994
- Tryin' to get something
to eat, I'm starving.

14:20.994 --> 14:21.882
- We can go eat.

14:21.882 --> 14:22.989
- Okay, cool.

14:22.989 --> 14:25.259
- Let us finish like two more
things, then we'll go eat.

14:25.259 --> 14:26.932
(phone vibrating)

14:26.932 --> 14:27.765
Hey, ma.

14:30.808 --> 14:33.620
Of course we still coming,
why wouldn't we be?

14:33.620 --> 14:35.275
Momma, we went over this already, okay.

14:35.275 --> 14:38.562
Don't worry, nothing's gonna happen.

14:38.562 --> 14:40.979
Yeah, Gavin, he's right here.

14:42.113 --> 14:44.759
Gavin, my mom said if
anything happens to me

14:44.759 --> 14:46.253
you are responsible.

14:46.253 --> 14:47.515
- Tell your mom I said.

14:47.515 --> 14:49.046
(fingers snapping)

14:49.046 --> 14:50.713
- He said okay, mom.

14:51.606 --> 14:53.289
all right, love you too, bye.

14:53.289 --> 14:54.182
Lord!

14:54.182 --> 14:55.309
- Is your mom really trippin'
about us going over there?

14:55.309 --> 14:56.142
- Yes!

14:56.142 --> 14:56.975
- For what?

14:56.975 --> 14:58.744
- I don't know, hopefully,
she'll just get over it.

14:58.744 --> 15:00.161
- Oh, she just bein' a
mom, you know that right?

15:00.161 --> 15:01.491
- Yeah, I guess, my momma.

15:01.491 --> 15:03.166
If it was your momma calling
you, you'd be feeling some

15:03.166 --> 15:04.096
kind of way about it.

15:04.096 --> 15:05.024
- I have to do it, my mommma loves me.

15:05.024 --> 15:05.857
- Oh, shut up.

15:05.857 --> 15:06.690
- She'd be calling my father.

15:06.690 --> 15:07.523
- You coming with us to eat?

15:07.523 --> 15:10.954
- [Anna] No, I'm gonna stay
here and do some more work.

15:10.954 --> 15:13.571
- Okay, well, print off
another copy for me, please,

15:13.571 --> 15:14.785
if you don't mind.

15:14.785 --> 15:15.820
- [Anna] Oh, yeah.

15:15.820 --> 15:17.089
- [Genevieve] And don't
work too hard, okay?

15:17.089 --> 15:18.433
- [Anna] Okay, I won't.

15:18.433 --> 15:19.830
- You gonna carry this all the way --

15:19.830 --> 15:20.663
- Yeah, yeah, my bad.

15:20.663 --> 15:21.496
- [Ky] Please know, you
gotta get your own bags.

15:21.496 --> 15:22.329
- [Gavin] What you got in here?

15:22.329 --> 15:23.529
- [Ky] There is no concierge service here.

15:23.529 --> 15:25.780
- It's got my hair.
- [Gavin] Are you ser-

15:25.780 --> 15:27.529
- [Ky] all right!

15:27.529 --> 15:29.348
- Okay we know what part
this is, I don't even know

15:29.348 --> 15:31.037
what's going down.

15:31.037 --> 15:32.349
- [Ky] Oh, my God.

15:32.349 --> 15:33.432
Aye, aye-aye!

15:34.510 --> 15:36.610
- You put other stuff in my bag.

15:36.610 --> 15:39.027
- Getting a belt monogrammed.

15:40.866 --> 15:44.479
- I mean, Ky, what's in your
bag, you're not carrying them?

15:44.479 --> 15:46.034
- What's in your bag, your sex toys?

15:46.034 --> 15:47.913
(laughter)

15:47.913 --> 15:50.474
- Hey, you need them everywhere you go.

15:50.474 --> 15:51.507
Oh shi--

15:51.507 --> 15:52.645
- When you're that lonely, you do.

15:52.645 --> 15:54.326
- Okay, okay, is this on?

15:54.326 --> 15:57.640
We're going to see if this
plantation is really haunted.

15:57.640 --> 16:00.189
But I'm going because I
need the extra credit.

16:00.189 --> 16:01.545
- Well, if you actually
would've showed up to class,

16:01.545 --> 16:02.878
you wouldn't need the extra credit.

16:02.878 --> 16:04.296
- You're such an asshole.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.505
- [Ky] Yeah, and you're so damn funny.

16:05.505 --> 16:06.602
- That's really really
funny coming from the guy

16:06.602 --> 16:07.435
with the non-existent GPA.

16:07.435 --> 16:09.379
- Okay, okay, all right, okay.

16:09.379 --> 16:11.112
Two lovebirds, less talk and more packing.

16:11.112 --> 16:12.548
- Lovebirds? Fucking Ky, really?

16:12.548 --> 16:15.024
- Shut up guys, wasting
too much time, come on.

16:15.024 --> 16:16.221
- [Gavin] Of course she's right.

16:16.221 --> 16:20.388
That's why she's impatient,
half an hour damn late.

16:24.535 --> 16:26.329
- [Voiceover] Is someone gonna help--

16:26.329 --> 16:27.532
- [Voiceover] Man,
that's camera equipment,

16:27.532 --> 16:28.955
not some bale of hay, Jethro.

16:28.955 --> 16:32.389
- It just dropped, jeez, it just dropped.

16:32.389 --> 16:33.616
- Someone needs to help me pack this shit.

16:33.616 --> 16:34.449
Thank you.

16:36.554 --> 16:39.554
- Here, shut it real quick, shut it.

16:41.770 --> 16:44.365
- [Genevieve] I think men
should be well-groomed.

16:44.365 --> 16:46.878
- [Ky] The only thing I do is manscaping.

16:46.878 --> 16:47.711
- [Genevieve] What?

16:47.711 --> 16:49.731
- [Gavin] The only thing I do
is shave underneath my balls

16:49.731 --> 16:51.263
and my armpits.

16:51.263 --> 16:53.200
- [Genevieve] I thought
manscaping was like.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.562
- [Gavin] That's manscaping,
so you don't trap no smell.

16:55.562 --> 16:56.648
- I want out of the car, now.

16:56.648 --> 16:57.481
- [Anna] What, no, it doesn't trap it.

16:57.481 --> 16:58.657
- [Gavin] It gets funky down there.

16:58.657 --> 17:00.191
- [Misty] Now, like.

17:00.191 --> 17:02.388
- [Genevieve] No, she says, she
says she wouldn't date a guy

17:02.388 --> 17:04.799
that used more product in his head.

17:04.799 --> 17:06.513
- [Gavin] This ain't nothing
but juices and berries in here.

17:06.513 --> 17:08.173
- Which is like no product, so.

17:08.173 --> 17:09.006
I don't use any product.

17:09.006 --> 17:10.067
- You ever saw coming to America?

17:10.067 --> 17:11.339
- [Voiceover] This is
au naturel, right here.

17:11.339 --> 17:14.473
- [Voiceover] The afro-sheen,
from Coming to America?

17:14.473 --> 17:15.502
- [Gavin] Just let your soul
glow, let your soul glow.

17:15.502 --> 17:16.909
- [Voiceover] Yeah, that's it.

17:16.909 --> 17:18.118
That's ridiculous, look
at that, look at his face.

17:18.118 --> 17:18.952
- What happened?

17:18.952 --> 17:19.829
- [Voiceover] That shit was funny.

17:19.829 --> 17:22.715
- [Voiceover] She's jealous
of my hair, that's why.

17:22.715 --> 17:25.242
- [Voiceover] Really,
is that what that means?

17:25.242 --> 17:26.076
Is that what it is?

17:26.076 --> 17:26.909
- Is that why?

17:26.909 --> 17:28.742
No, I dye, Creole boo.

17:29.767 --> 17:31.399
Don't be jealous of hair.

17:31.399 --> 17:32.522
- Ky, what you put in your hair?

17:32.522 --> 17:33.999
- I don't put anything in there.

17:33.999 --> 17:34.832
- You what?

17:34.832 --> 17:35.665
- I don't use anything in my hair.

17:35.665 --> 17:37.672
- Misty, if you could give
him a makeover, you would.

17:37.672 --> 17:39.030
- All natural roots in your hair.

17:39.030 --> 17:40.906
- Let's say if you could give
him a makeover, you would.

17:40.906 --> 17:42.113
- Oh, that's right.

17:42.113 --> 17:43.003
- All protein?

17:43.003 --> 17:43.855
- I'm sorry.

17:43.855 --> 17:44.688
- All natural protein?

17:44.688 --> 17:46.938
(laughter)

17:48.021 --> 17:48.991
- [Voiceover] What is
it, once, twice a day?

17:48.991 --> 17:50.907
- [Misty] I missed it, I don't
know what the fuck you're--

17:50.907 --> 17:54.650
- [Gavin] They say you use all
natural protein in your hair.

17:54.650 --> 17:56.494
- [Ky] Do we really need
to explain that to you?

17:56.494 --> 17:58.672
When guys finish on your head,

17:58.672 --> 18:01.838
it gets stuck in your hair and cakes over.

18:01.838 --> 18:03.936
That's what they're referring to.

18:03.936 --> 18:05.783
- [Misty] Is that what's
wrong with your head?

18:05.783 --> 18:06.825
- [Jonah] Ky, I think she
needs a demonstration.

18:06.825 --> 18:07.658
- [Genevieve] She said
"Is that what's wrong

18:07.658 --> 18:08.491
with your head", she told Ky.

18:08.491 --> 18:10.886
- It's not crunchy, look.

18:10.886 --> 18:14.535
Yours is a little crunchy, though.

18:14.535 --> 18:15.518
- [Jonah] You gotta wash it out.

18:15.518 --> 18:16.954
- That's not nice, that's not nice.

18:16.954 --> 18:18.788
- Hey, one year, I saw, I
saw this dude here like,

18:18.788 --> 18:21.788
- [Misty] I can't even say anything.

18:24.413 --> 18:25.246
- [Genevieve] You wouldn't want somebody

18:25.246 --> 18:26.892
to talk to your mom like that.

18:26.892 --> 18:28.292
- [Gavin] Oh, my elbow really hurts.

18:28.292 --> 18:31.234
- [Voiceover] Damn, Misty,
how many do you really have?

18:31.234 --> 18:32.949
- [Gavin] My elbow really
hurts, like for real, for real.

18:32.949 --> 18:35.333
I think I need a sling or
something, damn. I'm serious.

18:35.333 --> 18:37.443
- [Ky] You need to quit being a pussy.

18:37.443 --> 18:38.860
- [Gavin] Really?

18:39.792 --> 18:42.345
- [Ky] Takes one to know one,
that's what I'm saying, right?

18:42.345 --> 18:45.152
- [Gavin] I was going to
say I am what I eat, but--

18:45.152 --> 18:49.728
- Ah, that would be awk--
- Too close to home for you?

18:49.728 --> 18:52.180
- That would be awkward.

18:52.180 --> 18:53.013
Fuck you.

18:54.340 --> 18:55.722
- [Ky] How do you like
'em, do you like 'em bald?

18:55.722 --> 18:58.097
- Anna, that is disrespect,
don't do that to her.

18:58.097 --> 18:59.424
- [Gavin] Anna, have you had a boyfriend

18:59.424 --> 19:00.455
since you've been in college?

19:00.455 --> 19:02.538
Since we've been here at school,
have you had a boyfriend?

19:02.538 --> 19:04.655
- Let me tell you how many fuckin' figures

19:04.655 --> 19:06.599
I'm gonna be making when
I get out of college,

19:06.599 --> 19:07.766
how about that?

19:07.766 --> 19:09.512
- We're talking about the dudes you've had

19:09.512 --> 19:10.494
since you've been in college.

19:10.494 --> 19:11.327
- Yeah, she was dating those dudes

19:11.327 --> 19:12.160
on the softball team.

19:12.160 --> 19:13.512
- And then her grades
dropped and that was it.

19:13.512 --> 19:15.038
- There is no dudes on the
softball team, you get it?

19:15.038 --> 19:15.972
- That one guy and then
your grades dropped

19:15.972 --> 19:16.805
and that was it.

19:16.805 --> 19:18.148
- You get it?
- I know.

19:18.148 --> 19:19.467
- Ky said you was messing with the dudes

19:19.467 --> 19:21.270
on the softball team.

19:21.270 --> 19:24.147
(laughter)

19:24.147 --> 19:26.422
- So, whatever, you guys are
just gonna be fucking jealous.

19:26.422 --> 19:27.577
- Just give me a number.

19:27.577 --> 19:29.120
- No, that guy was, he was --

19:29.120 --> 19:30.232
- [Gavin] What guy?

19:30.232 --> 19:31.065
- [Anna] It was just like --

19:31.065 --> 19:34.965
- [Ky] The guy who played
shortstop on the softball team?

19:34.965 --> 19:36.437
- [Genevieve] Don't do that to
my friend, that is my friend.

19:36.437 --> 19:38.545
- [Anna] Really?

19:38.545 --> 19:39.974
- [Gavin] I'm just
saying, let's be for real.

19:39.974 --> 19:40.807
Can we throw --

19:40.807 --> 19:41.778
- So how many people have you slept with?

19:41.778 --> 19:42.611
- [Ky] Let's be honest.

19:42.611 --> 19:44.624
(chattering)

19:44.624 --> 19:46.069
- [Genevieve] I have
never, I have never --

19:46.069 --> 19:47.524
- [Gavin] You actually
gonna put me out on this?

19:47.524 --> 19:49.742
You answer the question.

19:49.742 --> 19:52.306
- [Voiceover] Never Have
I Ever, let's do it.

19:52.306 --> 19:55.945
- [Voiceover] I don't wanna play that!

19:55.945 --> 19:59.629
- If you've never done it, then
you have to raise your hand.

19:59.629 --> 20:01.704
- [Jonah] You put three fingers
up and if you've done it,

20:01.704 --> 20:03.285
you take a finger down.

20:03.285 --> 20:06.842
- [Genevieve] So if you've done
it, you take a finger down.

20:06.842 --> 20:07.878
- [Voiceover] You go first.

20:07.878 --> 20:10.838
- [Genevieve] So I have never --

20:10.838 --> 20:12.920
- [Misty] It's never have
I ever, say it right.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.601
- [Genevieve] Please
don't be starting that.

20:14.601 --> 20:15.763
- [Misty] No, it's never
have I ever, start.

20:15.763 --> 20:16.930
- [Jonah] I'll start.

20:16.930 --> 20:19.524
Never have I ever gotten off in the shower

20:19.524 --> 20:20.896
with a sprinkler head. Little --

20:20.896 --> 20:23.229
(vibrating)

20:24.069 --> 20:28.152
- [Ky] Misty, go ahead
and take two fingers down.

20:36.292 --> 20:38.875
- [Anna] Never have I ever, uh,

20:42.046 --> 20:43.041
I have to say something

20:43.041 --> 20:44.106
that I've actually done?

20:44.106 --> 20:48.068
- [Voiceover] No, that
you've never ever done.

20:48.068 --> 20:50.818
- Never have I ever went to a bar

20:54.087 --> 20:55.866
and picked up three dudes

20:55.866 --> 20:56.699
- That's too much.

20:56.699 --> 20:58.582
- [Anna] At one time.

20:58.582 --> 21:00.625
- But we know you've never
picked up dudes, we know that.

21:00.625 --> 21:02.875
(laughter)

21:06.558 --> 21:09.061
- [Anna] Never ever failed a test.

21:09.061 --> 21:10.644
I got all you guys.

21:16.041 --> 21:19.676
- [Voiceover] I think it's a
good thing to fail on this.

21:19.676 --> 21:22.092
- [Genevieve] Never have I
ever slept with a professor

21:22.092 --> 21:23.944
to get a better grade.

21:23.944 --> 21:27.107
- [Anna] Wait, so you put it down?

21:27.107 --> 21:29.832
- [Ky] Why do you still have fingers up?

21:29.832 --> 21:30.832
- No, listen

21:32.441 --> 21:34.725
- [Gavin] She was hot,
and physics was hard.

21:34.725 --> 21:36.225
That's the only A.

21:40.407 --> 21:42.873
- Never have I ever slept slash flirted

21:42.873 --> 21:45.531
with a professor to get a better grade.

21:45.531 --> 21:46.846
- [Misty] Okay, fine.

21:46.846 --> 21:48.511
- [Anna] This is boring, I
haven't done any of that.

21:48.511 --> 21:49.584
- Hold on, I got one.

21:49.584 --> 21:51.824
Never have I ever fucked Jonah.

21:51.824 --> 21:53.717
(laughter)

21:53.717 --> 21:54.985
- Does it count if I do it myself?

21:54.985 --> 21:56.310
- [Misty] Did you just put a finger down?

21:56.310 --> 21:57.960
- [Ky] I did, we had that one night.

21:57.960 --> 21:59.793
We had that one night.

22:01.287 --> 22:04.156
- [Gavin] I guess I gotta put it down too.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.011
- [Voiceover] Yes, really?

22:06.011 --> 22:07.520
- [Voiceover] Drive, drive.

22:07.520 --> 22:09.937
(exclaiming)

22:12.221 --> 22:14.575
(engine revving)

22:14.575 --> 22:16.825
(laughter)

22:27.305 --> 22:29.371
- Are we lost?
- [Jonah] What?

22:29.371 --> 22:30.904
- [Anna] Are we lost?

22:30.904 --> 22:33.672
- [Jonah] No, we're good.

22:33.672 --> 22:36.290
- It doesn't look like you
know where you're going.

22:36.290 --> 22:38.155
I know exactly where we're
going, it's these signs

22:38.155 --> 22:39.596
that are off.

22:39.596 --> 22:41.590
- Oh, yeah, sure.

22:41.590 --> 22:42.536
You are so lost.

22:42.536 --> 22:43.786
- I'm not lost.

22:47.709 --> 22:48.709
- He is so--

22:50.670 --> 22:52.470
(screaming)

22:52.470 --> 22:53.303
- [Voiceover] Shit, shit.

22:53.303 --> 22:54.136
- [Voiceover] What the hell?

22:54.136 --> 22:54.969
- Are you okay?

22:54.969 --> 22:56.026
- [Voiceover] Keep your eyes on the road.

22:56.026 --> 22:56.984
Are you all right?

22:56.984 --> 22:57.920
- [Voiceover] Jesus!

22:57.920 --> 22:58.753
- What's wrong?

22:58.753 --> 22:59.586
- I had a nightmare.

22:59.586 --> 23:02.847
- A nightmare, okay,
its gonna be, oh shit --

23:02.847 --> 23:04.694
- We need to go to the
nearest gas station.

23:04.694 --> 23:07.277
- Gas station, just keep going.

23:15.509 --> 23:16.522
- We're headed to the Lafitte Plantation

23:16.522 --> 23:17.832
to shoot a documentary.

23:17.832 --> 23:18.914
- You goin' to the Lafittes?

23:18.914 --> 23:20.835
Honey, you don't want
no part of that place.

23:20.835 --> 23:22.912
- Really, why not?

23:22.912 --> 23:25.127
- That place is all bad,
aint nothin' good about it.

23:25.127 --> 23:26.803
The Lafittes been buried on that land

23:26.803 --> 23:29.040
and some people say they
still occupy that old house.

23:29.040 --> 23:32.042
You know late at night,
when nobody's watching,

23:32.042 --> 23:34.661
Felicity Lafitte shows up in the windows.

23:34.661 --> 23:36.527
I don't know baby,
maybe you kids should do

23:36.527 --> 23:37.782
your documentary about something else.

23:37.782 --> 23:38.615
- Wow.

23:38.615 --> 23:39.448
- Guys, let's go.

23:39.448 --> 23:40.281
- [Misty] It sounds
like you really believe

23:40.281 --> 23:41.707
in all this hocus pocus shit.

23:41.707 --> 23:43.242
- [Clerk] Hocus pocus shit, eh?

23:43.242 --> 23:45.156
As soon as you set foot in that place,

23:45.156 --> 23:47.049
you'll understand why you
need to get in that van,

23:47.049 --> 23:49.630
turn it around and go back
to where you come from.

23:49.630 --> 23:51.210
- Well, I need my extra
credit points for class,

23:51.210 --> 23:53.028
so I think I'll take my
chances with a ghost.

23:53.028 --> 23:55.361
(screaming)

23:59.442 --> 24:01.525
- Hey, Misty, what was she
talking about back there?

24:01.525 --> 24:03.474
What was that lady
talking about back there?

24:03.474 --> 24:06.347
- Nothing, just a local
trying to get under our skin.

24:06.347 --> 24:07.461
- You sure that's all, because something

24:07.461 --> 24:09.676
about this is really getting weird.

24:09.676 --> 24:12.241
- Look, you need to man up,
'cause I really need this.

24:12.241 --> 24:13.619
That was just some stupid old lady trying

24:13.619 --> 24:15.952
to get under our skin, okay?

24:16.845 --> 24:19.169
- Really? Look at Gen.

24:19.169 --> 24:20.891
Obviously, she doesn't want to do this.

24:20.891 --> 24:21.724
I don't know.

24:21.724 --> 24:22.942
We should turn around.

24:22.942 --> 24:24.272
- [Gavin] Jonah, what
are you talking about?

24:24.272 --> 24:26.528
- I'm talking about turning
this van around and going home.

24:26.528 --> 24:28.600
Obviously, Gen doesn't
want to do this anymore.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.365
- First of all, who the
fuck is you yellin' at?

24:30.365 --> 24:31.198
And what you mean, Gen?

24:31.198 --> 24:32.777
Last time I checked, Gen was my girl,

24:32.777 --> 24:34.068
so she go where the fuck I go.

24:34.068 --> 24:35.580
And guess what, we ain't
turning around for nothing.

24:35.580 --> 24:38.078
- Well, I have the keys,
so I say what goes.

24:38.078 --> 24:38.915
- That's how you feel?

24:38.915 --> 24:39.748
- Yeah, that's exactly how I feel.

24:39.748 --> 24:41.121
- Well, we're gonna change that shit--

24:41.121 --> 24:41.954
- Hell, let's change it right now.

24:41.954 --> 24:44.611
- Hey, guys, stop, stop!

24:44.611 --> 24:46.195
Stop it.

24:46.195 --> 24:47.028
God, stop.

24:47.940 --> 24:49.568
Take a chill pill, let's get in the van.

24:49.568 --> 24:50.480
Go, come on.

24:50.480 --> 24:51.463
- No, we're not.

24:51.463 --> 24:53.218
Let's just let them duke it out right now,

24:53.218 --> 24:54.731
lemme throw a 20 on Gavin.

24:54.731 --> 24:58.748
- Or, I could take the camera
and bash your fuckin' face in.

24:58.748 --> 25:01.924
I don't think so, get in the van.

25:01.924 --> 25:02.757
Go.

25:05.270 --> 25:07.585
- [Misty] Oh, my gosh,
why are we stopping now?

25:07.585 --> 25:08.507
- Gotta piss, out of my way.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.016
- Really?

25:10.016 --> 25:11.418
- [Voiceover] Because we're here.

25:11.418 --> 25:12.707
- Here, where?

25:12.707 --> 25:15.249
I don't see a house here.

25:15.249 --> 25:17.234
- 'Cause it's on the other
side of the wooded area.

25:17.234 --> 25:18.817
- Huh. Oh, hell no.

25:19.908 --> 25:22.068
I'll be right here when y'all get back.

25:22.068 --> 25:24.460
- Really, well then I'll
just tell the professor

25:24.460 --> 25:27.017
that you did nothing but
chew bubblegum all weekend

25:27.017 --> 25:29.514
and you'll get an F.

25:29.514 --> 25:30.971
- Bitch.

25:30.971 --> 25:34.721
- Thank you, now get
your ass out of the van.

25:41.354 --> 25:43.687
- [Voiceover] What the hell?

25:46.313 --> 25:48.134
- Hey, dude, you got it all right?

25:48.134 --> 25:49.012
You good?

25:49.012 --> 25:50.091
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I'm good.

25:50.091 --> 25:51.091
- All right.

25:53.481 --> 25:57.206
- What the hell is this
abandoned plantation?

25:57.206 --> 25:58.600
- It's where they kept the horses.

25:58.600 --> 25:59.903
- [Ky] Where Misty turns her tricks.

25:59.903 --> 26:02.153
(laughter)

26:03.508 --> 26:05.126
- [Ky] Misty, you never play these games.

26:05.126 --> 26:05.959
- [Misty] There's
probably still some horses

26:05.959 --> 26:08.479
in there that you could
screw if you wanted.

26:08.479 --> 26:09.325
- [Jonah] Actually, he filmed that

26:09.325 --> 26:10.431
with the last girl that he had,

26:10.431 --> 26:13.962
she kinda actually hooked it right in.

26:13.962 --> 26:17.034
- Hey, Jonah, it was your mom, so.

26:17.034 --> 26:19.413
- My mom doesn't stoop
down to your standards.

26:19.413 --> 26:21.529
- [Anna] I want to see what's in here

26:21.529 --> 26:23.086
- [Misty] Come on, we already did this.

26:23.086 --> 26:25.167
This cannot be the place.

26:25.167 --> 26:26.348
- [Gavin] That's how people get killed.

26:26.348 --> 26:27.610
You always tryin' to look into something.

26:27.610 --> 26:28.764
- [Voiceover] No, let her go then.

26:28.764 --> 26:29.859
Let her go, Gav, let her go.

26:29.859 --> 26:31.162
- I'm not gonna be the first
black guy getting killed.

26:31.162 --> 26:31.995
I'm not, I refuse.

26:31.995 --> 26:32.828
- [Misty] Anna, this cannot be the place,

26:32.828 --> 26:34.002
you saw pictures.

26:34.002 --> 26:35.063
- [Gavin] I refuse, I refuse.

26:35.063 --> 26:36.382
- I don't think so.

26:36.382 --> 26:37.299
I am sorry.

26:39.239 --> 26:41.011
- [Voiceover] Bring your
crocodile hunter butt over here,

26:41.011 --> 26:42.208
get out of here, man.

26:42.208 --> 26:44.430
Always trying to travel things.

26:44.430 --> 26:46.136
- [Voiceover] Act like
you enjoy the place.

26:46.136 --> 26:47.570
- [Gavin] Jordan, didn't I
tell you about that, stupid.

26:47.570 --> 26:49.696
Oh my god. What the --

26:49.696 --> 26:52.029
(screaming)

26:56.316 --> 26:58.203
(laughter)

26:58.203 --> 26:59.883
- [Voiceover] Stop, stop, wait, wait.

26:59.883 --> 27:01.933
- [Voiceover] You dumbasses.

27:01.933 --> 27:04.261
You know you all a bunch of dumbasses.

27:04.261 --> 27:07.354
(murmuring)

27:07.354 --> 27:08.792
- [Voiceover] You gonna lag
ass or you gonna come with us?

27:08.792 --> 27:11.125
- [Voiceover] Whatever, bro.

27:12.176 --> 27:13.489
- [Voiceover] What, heard what?

27:13.489 --> 27:14.666
Wait, why are you the biggest fan?

27:14.666 --> 27:15.679
That's what I'm wondering.

27:15.679 --> 27:17.012
Like every dude.

27:17.968 --> 27:20.005
- [Gavin] It's something
different, that's all.

27:20.005 --> 27:21.361
- [Voiceover] Hey, you got enough wire

27:21.361 --> 27:23.194
to catch the feed from that house?

27:23.194 --> 27:24.098
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I'm actually gonna be

27:24.098 --> 27:26.821
monitoring it from the van, so.

27:26.821 --> 27:28.686
- Wait, you're not coming?

27:28.686 --> 27:30.373
- [Voiceover] No, somebody
has to stay out here

27:30.373 --> 27:31.889
and run the control board.

27:31.889 --> 27:32.925
- [Voiceover] You getting
scared or something, girl?

27:32.925 --> 27:35.729
- No, I just thought there
were gonna be more men around.

27:35.729 --> 27:37.930
- [Voiceover] There are, you little baby.

27:37.930 --> 27:39.406
- [Voiceover] Don't you got enough men?

27:39.406 --> 27:40.239
- How much further, do you not see

27:40.239 --> 27:41.788
the damn house in front of you?

27:41.788 --> 27:44.871
- [Voiceover] You got plenty of them.

27:47.622 --> 27:50.789
- [Genevieve] Can we have some action?

27:57.971 --> 27:59.102
- [Gavin] I'm gonna take my jacket off,

27:59.102 --> 28:00.800
what the fuck was I thinking?

28:00.800 --> 28:01.892
- I'm glad I'm not wearing heels,

28:01.892 --> 28:03.892
that's all I got to say.

28:05.105 --> 28:06.049
- You wanted to be cool,

28:06.049 --> 28:07.781
I told you don't wear the damn thing.

28:07.781 --> 28:09.329
- [Voiceover] Let's go.

28:09.329 --> 28:10.270
- I left it in the van.

28:10.270 --> 28:11.103
Sorry.

28:13.935 --> 28:15.216
- [Gavin] I'm gonna go fuckin naked,

28:15.216 --> 28:16.314
it's hot as fuck out here.

28:16.314 --> 28:17.361
- Anna, I'm getting a tan,

28:17.361 --> 28:19.257
that's how long we've been walking.

28:19.257 --> 28:23.023
- Your skin, it would take the
sun to shine and still hold.

28:23.023 --> 28:24.068
- All day.

28:24.068 --> 28:25.876
- Early morning, for your skin.

28:25.876 --> 28:29.876
- You're the last fucker.
- That ain't happening.

28:31.318 --> 28:32.218
- Okay.

28:32.218 --> 28:35.718
- It would take the sun to sleep with you.

28:37.662 --> 28:39.064
- What kind of fucking grand fire.

28:39.064 --> 28:40.971
Talk about being in
pants, get out of here.

28:40.971 --> 28:43.362
- [Voiceover] Ridiculous.

28:43.362 --> 28:44.578
- I don't get it.

28:44.578 --> 28:45.778
- Of course not.

28:45.778 --> 28:47.025
- No, like.

28:47.025 --> 28:48.203
- What?

28:48.203 --> 28:50.298
- Is that what you did?

28:50.298 --> 28:51.603
- Are you making fun of me?

28:51.603 --> 28:52.436
- No.

28:52.436 --> 28:54.212
- What is there not to get?

28:54.212 --> 28:55.735
What is not to get?

28:55.735 --> 28:57.222
Help me understand.

28:57.222 --> 28:58.843
- I wanna use this for the documentary.

28:58.843 --> 29:00.576
How's that footage?

29:00.576 --> 29:01.409
- [Voiceover] All pretty good.

29:01.409 --> 29:02.242
- [Voiceover] Yeah?

29:02.242 --> 29:03.075
- [Voiceover] Yeah, yeah.

29:03.075 --> 29:03.908
- [Voiceover] Did you get
the houses to watch out?

29:03.908 --> 29:04.987
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I
did, it's a pretty shot.

29:04.987 --> 29:06.495
- [Voiceover] All right.

29:06.495 --> 29:09.519
- I think I stepped on this pine needle.

29:09.519 --> 29:10.650
- Yeah kinda like that, you know.

29:10.650 --> 29:12.110
Walking in intro, you know.

29:12.110 --> 29:14.206
Just maybe some B roll
or something like that,

29:14.206 --> 29:15.591
we could use for the documentary.

29:15.591 --> 29:18.424
- [Voiceover] Sounds good, my man.

29:22.302 --> 29:23.584
- [Anna] Oh, there he is.

29:23.584 --> 29:24.751
Guys, come on.

29:31.811 --> 29:32.926
- [Genevieve] Yeah, one
person we should so come

29:32.926 --> 29:34.021
and one person only.

29:34.021 --> 29:36.781
- [Misty] Can I go watch the van?

29:36.781 --> 29:39.692
- [Gavin] all right, let's go.

29:39.692 --> 29:43.598
- [Genevieve] I told you,
I can't take this weird.

29:43.598 --> 29:45.498
That damn hoe.

29:45.498 --> 29:48.498
Waiting on people to come freak out.

29:51.202 --> 29:54.035
- [Ky] You'll see me plenty later.

29:55.421 --> 29:57.987
- [Anna] Our friend wasn't,
she wasn't feeling really well

29:57.987 --> 30:01.100
and then it's a really
long walk for us, so.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.174
- [Charles] Oh.

30:02.174 --> 30:03.007
- Yeah.

30:03.007 --> 30:04.312
- [Charles] Why in the
hell didn't you all just

30:04.312 --> 30:05.757
drive up the side way to the main house?

30:05.757 --> 30:07.629
- [Misty] Side way? Side way?

30:07.629 --> 30:08.566
- [Gavin] Are you kidding me?

30:08.566 --> 30:10.249
- That wasn't in the map.

30:10.249 --> 30:12.249
- No, no, no, nevermind.

30:14.426 --> 30:16.656
- All I knew was I wouldn't
have waited too much longer.

30:16.656 --> 30:18.329
It'll be dark soon.

30:18.329 --> 30:19.162
- [Voiceover] Yeah,
I'm sure it gets pretty

30:19.162 --> 30:21.126
hard to see around here.

30:21.126 --> 30:23.045
- I been minding these
parts my whole life.

30:23.045 --> 30:24.583
I could get around here blindfolded.

30:24.583 --> 30:26.320
I just don't hang around here.

30:26.320 --> 30:29.676
What are you staring at young lady?

30:29.676 --> 30:30.795
- Don't mind her.

30:30.795 --> 30:32.722
She all right.

30:32.722 --> 30:34.645
- Well, you know this place
got a strange effect on folks.

30:34.645 --> 30:36.547
Now, if I had some time, I'd
tell you about some of it.

30:36.547 --> 30:37.552
- Just give us the keys
and a quick tour man,

30:37.552 --> 30:39.302
we don't got all day.

30:40.256 --> 30:43.506
- Brother, you could never be my buddy.

30:44.699 --> 30:46.776
And besides, I just tend the grounds.

30:46.776 --> 30:47.811
- [Voiceover] Okay.

30:47.811 --> 30:48.985
- I don't hang around here at night.

30:48.985 --> 30:50.076
- Okay, okay, you made your point.

30:50.076 --> 30:53.993
It's scary, just give us
the keys man, come on.

30:56.926 --> 30:58.546
- Okay, oh, sir.

30:58.546 --> 31:01.002
Did you want us to give the
keys back to you in the morning

31:01.002 --> 31:02.148
or leave them here or
meet you up somewhere or,

31:02.148 --> 31:04.735
what would you like us to do with that?

31:04.735 --> 31:07.068
(chuckling)

31:11.647 --> 31:12.480
- Sooner.

31:16.242 --> 31:18.242
- [Gavin] What the hell?

31:22.948 --> 31:24.894
- [Anna] God, that cigar smell.

31:24.894 --> 31:26.702
- [Voiceover] But like, let's
just forget about this guy.

31:26.702 --> 31:28.189
Come on, let's just go set up.

31:28.189 --> 31:29.022
- [Anna] All right, well, wait.

31:29.022 --> 31:31.713
Before we set up, while
it's still daylight,

31:31.713 --> 31:33.562
can we go ahead and like just take a tour

31:33.562 --> 31:36.154
around the house to for the documentary?

31:36.154 --> 31:36.999
- [Voiceover] More walking?

31:36.999 --> 31:38.144
- Sure, why not?

31:38.144 --> 31:38.977
We've already walked ten miles.

31:38.977 --> 31:40.246
- Yeah, let's walk some more.

31:40.246 --> 31:41.608
Relay for life.

31:41.608 --> 31:43.733
Let's keep going, walking walking walking.

31:43.733 --> 31:44.566
- Come on.

31:56.816 --> 31:57.983
Oh, hell yeah.

31:59.957 --> 32:00.790
Service.

32:05.111 --> 32:07.861
(metal clanging)

32:14.705 --> 32:17.538
- Piece of shit, open the fuck up.

32:34.101 --> 32:36.242
- [Gavin] What's wrong with you?

32:36.242 --> 32:38.248
- [Genevieve] What? Nothing.

32:38.248 --> 32:39.454
- What do you mean nothing?

32:39.454 --> 32:40.287
You been quiet all the time

32:40.287 --> 32:41.642
and quiet ain't your personality.

32:41.642 --> 32:44.060
- Yeah, you know, I'm
just not feeling this.

32:44.060 --> 32:45.200
- What you mean you're not feeling this?

32:45.200 --> 32:46.648
- What you mean?

32:46.648 --> 32:48.682
- First of all, I been
trying to figure out

32:48.682 --> 32:49.979
is Jonah right or not?

32:49.979 --> 32:51.363
Since he know you so well.

32:51.363 --> 32:52.561
Do you wanna go back or not?

32:52.561 --> 32:53.394
- You know what?

32:53.394 --> 32:54.913
This don't have shit to do with Jonah.

32:54.913 --> 32:56.819
When the caretaker asked
me what was wrong with me,

32:56.819 --> 32:58.552
you ain't have shit to say, Gavin.

32:58.552 --> 32:59.600
You had nothing to say.

32:59.600 --> 33:00.522
Then back at the store,

33:00.522 --> 33:04.095
oh, that's my girl, she go
where I go, she do what I do.

33:04.095 --> 33:06.320
Right, that's what you
say to her, I heard you.

33:06.320 --> 33:07.309
I heard you.

33:07.309 --> 33:09.222
- Put your motherfucking voice
down when you talk to me.

33:09.222 --> 33:10.367
- Do you know who talking to?

33:10.367 --> 33:11.200
- I know who the fuck I'm talking to,

33:11.200 --> 33:12.073
- Apparently not, apparently not.

33:12.073 --> 33:12.910
- So I'm telling you
to put your voice down.

33:12.910 --> 33:14.003
Second of all if you wanna
go ahead and be on him.

33:14.003 --> 33:15.107
- You know what, I don't
have time to deal with this.

33:15.107 --> 33:16.314
- First of all, you don't walk
away when I'm talking to you.

33:16.314 --> 33:17.291
- No, I don't have time to deal with this

33:17.291 --> 33:18.129
and you gonna let me go.

33:18.129 --> 33:18.962
- I'mma let you go?

33:18.962 --> 33:19.795
- Oh, you will.

33:19.795 --> 33:20.628
- Or what?

33:20.628 --> 33:21.461
- What the fuck are you looking at?

33:21.461 --> 33:22.374
- [Gavin] Hey, don't get
mad at the damn cameraman

33:22.374 --> 33:23.517
'cause your ass --

33:23.517 --> 33:25.600
(static)

34:33.617 --> 34:34.449
- So hot.

34:38.989 --> 34:41.164
- It looks like different
plants growing in this way.

34:41.164 --> 34:42.663
- [Misty] What are you doing?

34:42.663 --> 34:45.779
- [Anna] I'm just looking
at the, it's like hunting.

34:45.779 --> 34:48.029
(laughter)

34:51.780 --> 34:53.621
- [Voiceover] Hey what's up?

34:53.621 --> 34:54.455
- [Misty] Running from the bugs

34:54.455 --> 34:55.858
that were trying to catch me.

34:55.858 --> 34:56.842
- [Voiceover] You would.

34:56.842 --> 34:57.676
- [Jonah] Really?

34:57.676 --> 34:58.847
- [Misty] They're bees!

34:58.847 --> 34:59.830
- Actually, there's a nest,

34:59.830 --> 35:00.738
there's gotta be a nest
over there somewhere.

35:00.738 --> 35:01.571
- [Voiceover] Oh shit.

35:01.571 --> 35:02.713
- [Voiceover] That we just pissed off.

35:02.713 --> 35:03.930
- [Misty] Shit.

35:03.930 --> 35:06.306
Okay, all right Anna.

35:06.306 --> 35:08.106
You go kill the bees, please.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.379
- [Voiceover] Yeah there's
a lot of them in there.

35:09.379 --> 35:11.525
- [Voiceover] Dude, it's
fine, don't worry about it.

35:11.525 --> 35:13.459
- [Voiceover] I'm not
getting stung, fuck that.

35:13.459 --> 35:15.430
- [Misty] You're more of a girl than me.

35:15.430 --> 35:18.638
- [Anna] All right, whatever.

35:18.638 --> 35:20.344
- [Voiceover] They are angry.

35:20.344 --> 35:22.841
- [Anna] Okay, I'm not.

35:22.841 --> 35:23.862
- [Voiceover] Honestly,
as long as you're not

35:23.862 --> 35:27.098
like right around here you're fine.

35:27.098 --> 35:28.015
We're good.

35:29.919 --> 35:31.673
Well, obviously then this
place isn't deserted.

35:31.673 --> 35:32.506
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

35:32.506 --> 35:33.640
- Oh yeah, cause bees live here.

35:33.640 --> 35:34.473
- Well, that's not the only thing.

35:34.473 --> 35:35.328
- Hopefully, those are the
only weird thing we see.

35:35.328 --> 35:36.161
- [Misty] No, really though,

35:36.161 --> 35:38.263
I feel like someone's watching me.

35:38.263 --> 35:41.037
- Yeah, I feel like
someone's watching me too.

35:41.037 --> 35:44.491
- Yeah, that's true, people
are always watching you.

35:44.491 --> 35:46.723
- [Anna] You guys are
like talking bobble heads.

35:46.723 --> 35:50.677
- [Voiceover] Hey, come
here, look at this.

35:50.677 --> 35:52.594
- [Anna] What the hell?

35:55.379 --> 35:58.796
- [Misty] Oh my God, this one was a baby.

35:59.795 --> 36:01.120
- [Voiceover] Where's Gen?

36:01.120 --> 36:03.203
- [Genevieve] Right here.

36:05.156 --> 36:08.007
I'm fine, we just need to
get the show on the road.

36:08.007 --> 36:09.956
Set up everything in the house.

36:09.956 --> 36:11.544
- Yeah, I'm down, let's go.

36:11.544 --> 36:13.127
- [Voiceover] Damn.

36:26.713 --> 36:28.678
- [Gavin] I did my tour but it's of the --

36:28.678 --> 36:29.511
(laughter)

36:29.511 --> 36:30.344
- [Voiceover] Yup.

36:30.344 --> 36:31.648
- [Gavin] Give us a start.

36:31.648 --> 36:34.231
(loud banging)

36:36.171 --> 36:37.183
- [Gavin] He just put the key in the door

36:37.183 --> 36:38.083
and the door banged.

36:38.083 --> 36:38.916
- [Voiceover] Hey, maybe
you were fucking ready.

36:38.916 --> 36:40.289
- It was loud as shit, you didn't hear?

36:40.289 --> 36:41.122
- [Gavin] Something's in there.

36:41.122 --> 36:42.663
- Listen, no one is in there.

36:42.663 --> 36:43.968
- How do you know that?

36:43.968 --> 36:45.035
- Gen, listen.

36:45.035 --> 36:47.469
(yelling)

36:47.469 --> 36:48.603
- I don't care who's in there,

36:48.603 --> 36:50.185
we are not leaving until we are done.

36:50.185 --> 36:51.018
- You're talking bullshit.

36:51.018 --> 36:51.905
Someone's in there.

36:51.905 --> 36:53.335
- Let's go, let's get out of here.

36:53.335 --> 36:55.702
- No, you know what,
we're not going anywhere.

36:55.702 --> 36:56.535
- Yes, we are.

36:56.535 --> 36:58.132
- We're gonna finish this
project with or without you,

36:58.132 --> 36:59.534
you can go wait in the fucking van.

36:59.534 --> 37:00.867
I got this shit.

37:02.295 --> 37:05.272
(screaming)

37:05.272 --> 37:06.177
- Hi.

37:06.177 --> 37:07.649
- [Gavin] Which way did he come from?

37:07.649 --> 37:08.482
- Okay.

37:08.482 --> 37:09.315
- I'm gonna leave it in the back.

37:09.315 --> 37:10.497
I'll be back to pick it up tomorrow.

37:10.497 --> 37:11.637
- Okay.

37:11.637 --> 37:13.590
- [Voiceover] This is
obviously another reason

37:13.590 --> 37:16.507
we should get the hell out of here.

37:17.531 --> 37:19.869
(knocking)

37:19.869 --> 37:20.702
- [Misty] Well, you see, look.

37:20.702 --> 37:22.415
They're letting us in.

37:22.415 --> 37:25.109
- [Ky] Oh, God, what is that smell?

37:25.109 --> 37:27.326
- [Gavin] I bet it's death.

37:27.326 --> 37:28.629
- [Ky] Dude, wait until you get in here.

37:28.629 --> 37:29.462
Holy shit.

37:29.462 --> 37:30.365
- [Misty] Hello?

37:30.365 --> 37:31.922
- [Ky] Hello?

37:31.922 --> 37:33.674
No one is in here, it's
the wind like I said.

37:33.674 --> 37:34.896
- Dude, it's fucking cold.

37:34.896 --> 37:38.278
- Maybe it's this funky fucking
smell banging on the door.

37:38.278 --> 37:39.520
- It's cold.

37:39.520 --> 37:41.611
Really really cold.

37:41.611 --> 37:43.667
- [Voiceover] Dude I'm
just saying, come on.

37:43.667 --> 37:45.277
Are you not, are you coming in?

37:45.277 --> 37:46.124
- [Misty] Seriously, guys.

37:46.124 --> 37:46.971
- [Gavin] Nah, we good.

37:46.971 --> 37:47.863
- [Ky] Dude, there's nothing here.

37:47.863 --> 37:48.696
- [Misty] You are such pussies.

37:48.696 --> 37:50.423
- Y'all grade depends on this.

37:50.423 --> 37:52.134
- Dude, come on, there's
nothing in here guys.

37:52.134 --> 37:53.273
- [Voiceover] It's dark as hell.

37:53.273 --> 37:54.636
- [Voiceover] You check
it out then we'll do it.

37:54.636 --> 37:56.493
- [Voiceover] Dude.

37:56.493 --> 37:58.438
- Hey guys, let's go get the equipment.

37:58.438 --> 38:00.751
Let's get set up, come on.

38:00.751 --> 38:03.787
- [Voiceover] Hey, Anna, are you coming?

38:03.787 --> 38:06.968
- Hey wait, which one of
y'all's bringing the car back?

38:06.968 --> 38:09.801
- [Voiceover] Yeah, Anna, come on.

38:10.971 --> 38:12.841
- [Misty] Dude, who's
bringing the car back?

38:12.841 --> 38:13.674
To the side road?

38:13.674 --> 38:15.039
- [Voiceover] Hey hey
hey, no y'all listen.

38:15.039 --> 38:16.682
We're gonna leave it where it is.

38:16.682 --> 38:17.515
- Why?

38:17.515 --> 38:19.104
I don't wanna walk any
farther than I have to.

38:19.104 --> 38:20.417
- [Voiceover] Because I
don't pick up any feedback

38:20.417 --> 38:22.184
from the house, so, Anna.

38:22.184 --> 38:23.526
- [Anna] Yes?

38:23.526 --> 38:25.252
- [Voiceover] Come get this camera.

38:25.252 --> 38:27.158
(mumbling)

38:27.158 --> 38:28.491
We'll be back.

38:28.491 --> 38:30.679
- [Voiceover] All right,
see you in a minute.

38:30.679 --> 38:32.179
- [Voiceover] All right.

38:32.179 --> 38:33.617
- [Misty] Y'all enjoy the fresh air.

38:33.617 --> 38:37.534
- [Voiceover] Yeah, enjoy
that funky ass smell.

38:39.119 --> 38:41.149
- Okay, no really though, do I look good?

38:41.149 --> 38:42.482
- [Anna] Uh, no.

38:45.083 --> 38:47.065
- [Misty] Nice.

38:47.065 --> 38:48.794
Okay, this is creepy.

38:48.794 --> 38:49.917
- [Genevieve] Wow.

38:49.917 --> 38:50.817
- [Anna] Even though it's dirty,

38:50.817 --> 38:52.928
it's actually still pretty nice.

38:52.928 --> 38:56.358
- [Misty] You would think that, Anna.

38:56.358 --> 38:57.329
- [Anna] Hey, Gen?

38:57.329 --> 38:58.538
- [Genevieve] Hmm?

38:58.538 --> 39:00.703
- [Anna] You've been kind of quiet.

39:00.703 --> 39:03.448
Is everything okay, with you and Gavin?

39:03.448 --> 39:05.538
- You know, I don't know.

39:05.538 --> 39:09.089
He's upset that Jonah
said that we have history.

39:09.089 --> 39:10.515
- Can you blame the guy?

39:10.515 --> 39:12.852
You were with Jonah
freshman to sophomore year.

39:12.852 --> 39:14.400
- Okay, well he needs to get over it,

39:14.400 --> 39:15.665
that was two years ago.

39:15.665 --> 39:17.041
We finished.

39:17.041 --> 39:19.077
- Well, if I had a man
with a body like Gavin,

39:19.077 --> 39:20.885
Jonah would be the last thing on my mind.

39:20.885 --> 39:22.090
- Bitch, if you had a man.

39:22.090 --> 39:22.923
- Yeah.

39:22.923 --> 39:24.212
- Yeah, and you don't.

39:24.212 --> 39:26.962
- You just don't know about them.

39:30.485 --> 39:32.740
- [Anna] It's been good so far.

39:32.740 --> 39:35.928
- [Misty] We have to behave, guys.

39:35.928 --> 39:37.011
What is that?

39:38.545 --> 39:40.850
- [Anna] I don't know.

39:40.850 --> 39:42.100
Oh my God, wow.

39:43.715 --> 39:46.632
- Is that the lady that lived here?

39:49.201 --> 39:50.579
Dude, she kind of looks like you.

39:50.579 --> 39:52.282
- [Gen] Yeah, no she doesn't, actually.

39:52.282 --> 39:53.849
Not at all, I don't think so.

39:53.849 --> 39:55.635
- [Anna] It is her.

39:55.635 --> 39:57.968
- Okay, and how do you know?

39:59.315 --> 40:00.803
Okay, what is her problem?

40:00.803 --> 40:03.412
- [Anna] Dude, just, whatever.

40:03.412 --> 40:05.273
Leave her alone.

40:05.273 --> 40:06.688
- Leave her alone?

40:06.688 --> 40:08.981
She just fucking storms
away and it's okay?

40:08.981 --> 40:10.320
Really, really?

40:10.320 --> 40:11.461
- [Anna] I don't know,

40:11.461 --> 40:13.464
it might just be this thing
with Gavin, I don't know.

40:13.464 --> 40:14.576
Whatever.

40:14.576 --> 40:17.162
- I just wanna get out of
this freaking creepy house.

40:17.162 --> 40:17.995
- [Anna] Okay, well.

40:17.995 --> 40:18.828
- Wait, why are the windows boarded up?

40:18.828 --> 40:20.137
Explain this to me.

40:20.137 --> 40:21.729
- [Anna] I don't know,
they didn't tell me,

40:21.729 --> 40:24.397
I don't know, I don't
have all the answers.

40:24.397 --> 40:26.017
- Oh, really?

40:26.017 --> 40:27.895
Did you just admit that?

40:27.895 --> 40:29.993
- [Anna] Yeah, really, great.

40:29.993 --> 40:31.719
Let's just go upstairs, cause they've got,

40:31.719 --> 40:35.870
I can turn the light
off when I get upstairs.

40:35.870 --> 40:37.988
- [Misty] Okay, this place is huge.

40:37.988 --> 40:38.912
- [Anna] Yeah.

40:38.912 --> 40:40.138
- [Genevieve] Yo, I'm up here.

40:40.138 --> 40:41.022
- [Anna] Where?

40:41.022 --> 40:44.265
- [Misty] You came up here by yourself?

40:44.265 --> 40:45.855
- [Genevive] Hurry in.

40:45.855 --> 40:47.541
- [Misty] Hey.

40:47.541 --> 40:49.831
What are you doing?

40:49.831 --> 40:51.292
- [Genevieve] Looking outside.

40:51.292 --> 40:52.852
- [Anna] This is a good view.

40:52.852 --> 40:54.076
- [Genevieve] No, Anna, you're right.

40:54.076 --> 40:56.022
It is a nice place.

40:56.022 --> 40:57.648
Like, you can tell it was nice

40:57.648 --> 40:59.116
a long time ago is all I'm saying.

40:59.116 --> 41:00.136
- [Misty] Really?

41:00.136 --> 41:02.053
Okay, yeah, I get that.

41:03.601 --> 41:04.434
Wait.

41:05.381 --> 41:06.858
- [Genevieve] That one's
locked, I don't know.

41:06.858 --> 41:09.802
- [Anna] He told us we
could have a whole bed.

41:09.802 --> 41:12.346
(screaming)

41:12.346 --> 41:14.288
- [Misty] Oh my god!

41:14.288 --> 41:15.121
Really?

41:20.450 --> 41:21.384
- [Voiceover] What's going on?

41:21.384 --> 41:22.508
- [Genevieve] Rats.

41:22.508 --> 41:23.341
- Rats?

41:23.341 --> 41:24.377
- In the closet, rats.

41:24.377 --> 41:25.210
- [Voiceover] Rats?

41:25.210 --> 41:27.806
- Yes, like for real, more than one.

41:27.806 --> 41:28.639
- [Anna] Oh my god.

41:28.639 --> 41:29.485
- Really?

41:29.485 --> 41:31.034
- Yo, that's just cause
ya'll didn't see it.

41:31.034 --> 41:32.102
That's what made me see.

41:32.102 --> 41:34.935
- What the -- I hate fucking guys.

41:36.586 --> 41:38.836
- They know we're above it.

41:39.739 --> 41:40.848
- [Voiceover] I can't believe that guy's

41:40.848 --> 41:43.019
doing all this dish work.

41:43.019 --> 41:44.437
Do you know how to set this up?

41:44.437 --> 41:45.922
- I don't really have a clue.

41:45.922 --> 41:48.860
I've done it once or twice,
don't ask me how I know.

41:48.860 --> 41:50.591
- It's the intro to film class, huh?

41:50.591 --> 41:51.813
- Intro to film, of course man.

41:51.813 --> 41:52.966
That's the whole reason we go to class.

41:52.966 --> 41:55.503
Too bad I don't really pay attention.

41:55.503 --> 41:56.593
- Who really does?

41:56.593 --> 41:58.343
That professor sucks.

41:59.384 --> 42:00.377
- I'll never say nothing.

42:00.377 --> 42:01.877
- No, it's cool, dude, man.

42:01.877 --> 42:02.710
- I think uh --

42:02.710 --> 42:03.543
- You got it on?

42:03.543 --> 42:04.376
- Yeah, I got it on.

42:04.376 --> 42:07.640
As a matter of fact,
gots a cool feature too.

42:07.640 --> 42:09.309
Back up, back up a second.

42:09.309 --> 42:10.659
- [Voiceover] What we got?

42:10.659 --> 42:12.226
- [Gavin] Back up a little more.

42:12.226 --> 42:14.701
I'm like the Grinch that Stole Christmas.

42:14.701 --> 42:15.836
Big nose you got.

42:15.836 --> 42:18.349
- [Voiceover] Hey, that's
kinda rude, you dick.

42:18.349 --> 42:19.500
- [Gavin] I got some night vision on this

42:19.500 --> 42:21.162
if I could find the frickin switch.

42:21.162 --> 42:22.708
- [Voiceover] Night vision
could come in handy.

42:22.708 --> 42:24.888
- [Gavin] I know man, where
the heck is this switch at?

42:24.888 --> 42:25.788
Oh, there it is, I got it.

42:25.788 --> 42:26.621
- [Voiceover] You got it?

42:26.621 --> 42:27.454
- [Gavin] Yeah.

42:27.454 --> 42:28.782
Boom.

42:28.782 --> 42:30.065
Yeah.

42:30.065 --> 42:31.633
- [Voiceover] Cause
next's our bedroom, huh?

42:31.633 --> 42:33.184
- [Gavin] Yeah all right,
let's go to the next room.

42:33.184 --> 42:34.184
- Let's go.

42:35.893 --> 42:39.694
- [Gavin] Bro, you watch those for me.

42:39.694 --> 42:40.834
- Ain't you over in Bowser?

42:40.834 --> 42:41.831
- Why, what's up?

42:41.831 --> 42:43.643
I'm trying to figure out what
I'm gonna do after graduation.

42:43.643 --> 42:44.833
- You're not gonna go pro?

42:44.833 --> 42:46.554
- Bro, I wish I could go pro,

42:46.554 --> 42:47.792
but after I blew my knee optices,

42:47.792 --> 42:50.223
it's like, the chances
aren't very high, not at all.

42:50.223 --> 42:51.955
- You can't go to training
camp or something like that?

42:51.955 --> 42:53.297
You're not gonna reach out?

42:53.297 --> 42:55.984
- I mean, I took this major
really to back up plan.

42:55.984 --> 42:57.490
But didn't nobody think
I'd be using it though.

42:57.490 --> 43:00.306
- Sportscaster, work for ESPN
or something, CBS Sports.

43:00.306 --> 43:02.563
- All those guys usually
work for that, they retired,

43:02.563 --> 43:05.085
they were great and acknowledged
and now they're retired.

43:05.085 --> 43:06.396
I don't even get a chance to do that.

43:06.396 --> 43:08.134
- But you're great in college.

43:08.134 --> 43:09.519
(scoffing)

43:09.519 --> 43:10.746
Guess I've always wanted to piss you off.

43:10.746 --> 43:13.034
- You're like pissing me off already.

43:13.034 --> 43:14.090
- Any other rooms?

43:14.090 --> 43:16.128
- Actually, we still
got the master bedroom.

43:16.128 --> 43:17.476
- Right here?

43:17.476 --> 43:19.157
- He said you could see a
silhouette lady on that side.

43:19.157 --> 43:20.129
- Take that dude.

43:20.129 --> 43:21.003
- Yeah.

43:21.003 --> 43:22.920
- [Voiceover] Let's go.

43:24.190 --> 43:25.867
Dude, is this thing locked?

43:25.867 --> 43:26.977
- [Voiceover] Bro, it's locked?

43:26.977 --> 43:29.087
- [Gavin] No, I checked it
earlier, it should be okay.

43:29.087 --> 43:30.647
- [Voiceover] I think
it's, then it's jammed.

43:30.647 --> 43:32.706
- [Ky] I can get it, hold on, all right.

43:32.706 --> 43:34.998
(laughing)

43:34.998 --> 43:35.831
Fuck.

43:37.934 --> 43:39.206
- [Gavin] Bro, you okay?

43:39.206 --> 43:40.495
- [Ky] Yeah, I'm fine.

43:40.495 --> 43:42.745
(laughter)

43:45.887 --> 43:47.584
- I'm pretty good at
being an ass, come on,

43:47.584 --> 43:48.592
I mean you're kidding me.

43:48.592 --> 43:50.842
(laughter)

43:53.401 --> 43:55.734
- [Ky] I just shit my pants.

43:56.776 --> 43:58.766
- [Gavin] Just shit my pants.

43:58.766 --> 43:59.683
- I'm good.

44:01.622 --> 44:02.888
Might have pooped a little bit.

44:02.888 --> 44:04.765
(laughter)

44:04.765 --> 44:05.903
- You got to set it up?

44:05.903 --> 44:07.031
- Yeah, I do, I got it.

44:07.031 --> 44:10.446
- Oh, real, so we can get
some of this weird stuff here.

44:10.446 --> 44:12.186
- This place, it ain't
a whole lot like home.

44:12.186 --> 44:13.199
- [Gavin] You know what,
I think you're right.

44:13.199 --> 44:14.915
I don't think we're even
gonna see shit at all.

44:14.915 --> 44:17.284
- Dude, so tell me, what's
going on with you and Gen.

44:17.284 --> 44:19.392
Y'all been fighting a lot.

44:19.392 --> 44:21.736
- Well, you see, it's
that love-hate nonsense,

44:21.736 --> 44:24.601
but forget about me, it's crazy what is up

44:24.601 --> 44:26.055
with you and Misty though.

44:26.055 --> 44:26.888
- Huh?

44:26.888 --> 44:27.893
- What's up with you and Misty?

44:27.893 --> 44:29.573
You say she be trying to
push up, wrestle up on you

44:29.573 --> 44:30.636
and all that stuff.

44:30.636 --> 44:31.482
When are you gonna go ahead

44:31.482 --> 44:32.771
and make a move on Misty or what?

44:32.771 --> 44:34.697
- If I can get her alone tonight, I will.

44:34.697 --> 44:36.848
- Hey, if you do, if you
get more play than me,

44:36.848 --> 44:37.965
that's wonderful.

44:37.965 --> 44:38.798
- Yeah.

44:39.967 --> 44:41.456
Well, things aren't
that bad, here we come.

44:41.456 --> 44:43.442
- Yep, shit is crazy.

44:43.442 --> 44:45.098
- [Voiceover] All right,
I need you to make sure

44:45.098 --> 44:46.594
that you got those lights
attached correctly,

44:46.594 --> 44:49.220
'cause they're not hanging
a light in this room.

44:49.220 --> 44:50.999
- What? No lights, dude? Come on.

44:50.999 --> 44:53.599
- Bro, this shit's abandoned,
what are you, scared?

44:53.599 --> 44:54.510
- Little bit.

44:54.510 --> 44:55.530
But you know me.

44:55.530 --> 44:56.593
- No, I'm not.

44:56.593 --> 44:58.426
Let's get out of here.

45:06.138 --> 45:07.358
- [Voiceover] Hey guys,
everything is set up

45:07.358 --> 45:08.792
and all the input is in place.

45:08.792 --> 45:11.422
And we need to start as soon as possible,

45:11.422 --> 45:12.674
but before I go to the
van, I want everybody

45:12.674 --> 45:14.922
to run those doors and
introductions please

45:14.922 --> 45:16.544
and no report's gonna run out.

45:16.544 --> 45:19.010
Queen Anna here, take the lead on this?

45:19.010 --> 45:20.267
- Don't mind if I do.

45:20.267 --> 45:21.411
- [Voiceover] Of course you are, please.

45:21.411 --> 45:22.911
- [Misty] Shocker.

45:23.786 --> 45:24.767
Is this good?

45:24.767 --> 45:26.514
- [Voiceover] Yes.

45:26.514 --> 45:28.685
- Hi, my name is Anna Davenport,

45:28.685 --> 45:30.127
and I'm a mass media major at

45:30.127 --> 45:32.622
the University of Southwestern Louisiana.

45:32.622 --> 45:37.095
I, along with my team
members, Gavin Charles,

45:37.095 --> 45:40.678
Genevieve Richard,
Misty Gilroy, Ky Brooks,

45:45.119 --> 45:47.464
and Jonah Girard are here to research

45:47.464 --> 45:50.428
the legend of the hauntings
of this plantation.

45:50.428 --> 45:52.848
It is legend that the former mistress,

45:52.848 --> 45:55.923
along with four Union
soldiers, died violently here.

45:55.923 --> 45:59.001
And their spirits are said
to still haunt these walls.

45:59.001 --> 46:01.203
In the recent past, there
have been a few people

46:01.203 --> 46:04.865
who have tried to inhabit this plantation.

46:04.865 --> 46:06.546
However, due to the spirits,

46:06.546 --> 46:09.624
they have not been said to stay very long.

46:09.624 --> 46:11.561
We do have state-of-the-art equipment

46:11.561 --> 46:15.359
that will capture some of
the footage, hopefully.

46:15.359 --> 46:16.192
Thank you.

46:17.360 --> 46:20.571
We have an EMF meter which
measures electro-magnetic fields.

46:20.571 --> 46:23.089
Electro-magnetic fields
are said to be present

46:23.089 --> 46:26.819
whenever spiritual entities are around.

46:26.819 --> 46:28.533
We also have an electric thermometer,

46:28.533 --> 46:30.806
which will measure the air
temperature in the room.

46:30.806 --> 46:32.126
That is said to change whenever

46:32.126 --> 46:35.384
these apparitions come into the same room.

46:35.384 --> 46:36.467
Thank you.

46:36.467 --> 46:40.642
And we do have a digital
recorder which will record

46:40.642 --> 46:43.420
any sounds that these spirits can make.

46:43.420 --> 46:45.603
- In other words, people,
if the bogeyman's here,

46:45.603 --> 46:46.578
we'll catch him tonight.

46:46.578 --> 46:47.432
- You're absolutely right.

46:47.432 --> 46:48.928
Also, we decided to set up cameras

46:48.928 --> 46:50.544
inside the home in the hot spots.

46:50.544 --> 46:52.077
We believe the hot spots in this home

46:52.077 --> 46:53.717
is the bedroom, the master bedroom,

46:53.717 --> 46:55.256
the staircase, and the hallway.

46:55.256 --> 46:58.015
This is where we believe
we'll see the most activity.

46:58.015 --> 46:59.387
- Besides the stationary cameras,

46:59.387 --> 47:01.204
everyone but me will have on headcams.

47:01.204 --> 47:03.187
These headcams will take the point of view

47:03.187 --> 47:05.056
of each person as they
go from room to room.

47:05.056 --> 47:08.213
I will have a handheld camera
as I move from room to room,

47:08.213 --> 47:09.839
gathering each person's experiences

47:09.839 --> 47:11.081
throughout the documentary.

47:11.081 --> 47:15.826
And if he's smart, he'll keep
it on this all night long.

47:15.826 --> 47:16.883
- Down, tiger.

47:16.883 --> 47:18.912
We'll just have to edit that out.

47:18.912 --> 47:20.948
Um, finally, we'll have
our engineer controlling

47:20.948 --> 47:23.768
camera shots and monitoring
footage from the van.

47:23.768 --> 47:26.093
- [Ky] Think that's about it.

47:26.093 --> 47:27.140
- Was that good?

47:27.140 --> 47:29.307
- [Voiceover] It was good.

47:30.898 --> 47:32.343
- [Jonah] All right, man, so what exactly

47:32.343 --> 47:33.990
are we looking for up here?

47:33.990 --> 47:35.922
- Okay, we got panties downstairs.

47:35.922 --> 47:36.755
- [Jonah] Uh, did you not see

47:36.755 --> 47:38.114
Misty's tits in that shirt?

47:38.114 --> 47:40.250
- Hell no, I wasn't listening
to, point well taken.

47:40.250 --> 47:42.109
Wait, hold on.

47:42.109 --> 47:42.942
- [Jonah] What?

47:42.942 --> 47:43.775
- Dude, I think I hear something here.

47:43.775 --> 47:44.608
- [Jonah] Seriously?

47:44.608 --> 47:45.441
- Yeah, seriously.

47:45.441 --> 47:47.910
Dude, there are definitely
spirits in here, I can hear them.

47:47.910 --> 47:49.018
Dude, are you getting this?

47:49.018 --> 47:51.103
- [Jonah] Well, if you
shut up, maybe I can.

47:51.103 --> 47:54.006
- Oh yeah, do you hear it, do you hear?

47:54.006 --> 47:55.082
- [Jonah] What?

47:55.082 --> 47:58.157
- It's right here, hold on.

47:58.157 --> 48:00.089
(farting)

48:00.089 --> 48:01.267
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, taste it, bro.

48:01.267 --> 48:02.768
- [Jonah] Oh, dude, you're such a dick.

48:02.768 --> 48:05.170
Oh, you just shit your pants, didn't you?

48:05.170 --> 48:07.253
- I definitely did, dude.

48:16.821 --> 48:18.899
- This place is kinda creepy.

48:18.899 --> 48:21.255
- I wonder if anyone
else has seen anything.

48:21.255 --> 48:24.013
- Oh, don't tell me you
believe in this shit too.

48:24.013 --> 48:26.117
- I don't know, I do, I don't.

48:26.117 --> 48:27.888
- Well, I don't.

48:27.888 --> 48:30.782
- Okay, well, you just said
this place was kinda creepy.

48:30.782 --> 48:33.806
- Yeah, and I totally meant in
the sense of spiders and rats

48:33.806 --> 48:35.375
not ghosts and goblins.

48:35.375 --> 48:37.035
- Come on, what's in this closet then?

48:37.035 --> 48:40.835
- Hey, no more playing the
game with this door, no.

48:40.835 --> 48:42.891
- It'll kill me if I don't.

48:42.891 --> 48:44.844
- Everything is going to kill you.

48:44.844 --> 48:45.761
Okay, fine.

48:48.556 --> 48:51.639
- See, nothing in here, just clothes.

48:52.897 --> 48:53.730
- Anna.

48:53.730 --> 48:54.563
- These are pretty nice.

48:54.563 --> 48:55.447
- There's nothing else in this house.

48:55.447 --> 48:56.858
Why the fuck are there clothes?

48:56.858 --> 48:57.805
- I don't know, check it out.

48:57.805 --> 49:00.154
(screaming)

49:00.154 --> 49:01.262
- Oh my god.

49:01.262 --> 49:03.454
What the fuck is wrong with you?

49:03.454 --> 49:04.758
- You scared the shit out of us.

49:04.758 --> 49:05.776
That shit is not funny.

49:05.776 --> 49:07.198
Seriously?

49:07.198 --> 49:09.462
- [Gavin] It was hilarious.

49:09.462 --> 49:10.295
Hilarious.

49:10.295 --> 49:11.273
- What are you doing?

49:11.273 --> 49:12.939
- You getting your ass
whooped would be funny.

49:12.939 --> 49:15.310
- [Gavin] Yeah, right, you would hurt me.

49:15.310 --> 49:16.639
- Uh, Gavin, what are you doing here?

49:16.639 --> 49:17.838
Where's Gen?

49:17.838 --> 49:18.775
- I don't know.

49:18.775 --> 49:20.339
I thought she was with you guys.

49:20.339 --> 49:21.749
- She's supposed to be with you.

49:21.749 --> 49:24.337
- Well, if you haven't noticed,
we have to talk about that.

49:24.337 --> 49:25.324
- 'Cause you're an ass.

49:25.324 --> 49:26.435
- No, 'cause she's an ass.

49:26.435 --> 49:27.321
- Okay, well that's great.

49:27.321 --> 49:28.629
Where is her ass?

49:28.629 --> 49:30.576
- No, I thought she was with you guys.

49:30.576 --> 49:31.562
- Okay, well, she's not with us,

49:31.562 --> 49:33.361
then she's probably deflowering Jonah.

49:33.361 --> 49:34.458
- Jonah?

49:34.458 --> 49:36.009
- Well, can you blame the girl?

49:36.009 --> 49:37.924
You kinda did just come out of the closet.

49:37.924 --> 49:38.813
- You know what, Misty?

49:38.813 --> 49:39.969
Go fuck yourself.

49:39.969 --> 49:41.177
- Hmm, I might.

49:41.177 --> 49:42.253
- All right, well, I'm gonna go downstairs

49:42.253 --> 49:45.088
and check and see if Ky and
the other guys have Gen.

49:45.088 --> 49:46.330
- I'll come with you.

49:46.330 --> 49:48.083
- Hey, wait, me alone?

49:48.083 --> 49:49.000
- Uh, yeah.

49:51.145 --> 49:53.057
I thought you said you
didn't believe in all this.

49:53.057 --> 49:54.332
- Well, I don't.

49:54.332 --> 49:55.369
I'll be fine.

49:55.369 --> 49:57.216
- Okay, good, we'll be back.

49:57.216 --> 49:58.216
- All right.

49:59.069 --> 50:00.116
- [Anna] You have the lights on?

50:00.116 --> 50:03.533
- [Gavin] Yeah, all right, let's go down.

50:07.973 --> 50:09.803
- [Misty] Dammit!

50:09.803 --> 50:11.720
No toilet, big shocker.

50:12.563 --> 50:16.348
Big shocker, no toilet in
the big plantation, Anna.

50:16.348 --> 50:18.492
I fuckin' hate y'all, I hate y'all.

50:18.492 --> 50:20.742
(stomping)

50:22.128 --> 50:25.045
(leaves crunching)

50:26.729 --> 50:29.165
- Really, Gen? You would
find that the only plantation

50:29.165 --> 50:31.665
ever without a bathroom, like!

50:39.826 --> 50:42.159
(urinating)

50:51.256 --> 50:52.853
Much better.

50:52.853 --> 50:54.686
Ugh, this is so gross.

51:10.364 --> 51:12.697
(screaming)

51:17.749 --> 51:20.582
(water splashing)

52:19.823 --> 52:21.048
- [Jonah] Hey Anna, what are you doing?

52:21.048 --> 52:22.609
- Hey, what's up?

52:22.609 --> 52:26.192
Nothing, I was actually,
I was looking for,

52:27.491 --> 52:28.834
I was just looking for you.

52:28.834 --> 52:30.734
- [Jonah] I don't know where Ky is.

52:30.734 --> 52:32.044
- [Anna] Seriously?

52:32.044 --> 52:34.711
- [Jonah] No, I've been outside.

52:35.680 --> 52:37.785
- [Anna] Have you seen Gen?

52:37.785 --> 52:41.112
- [Jonah] No, no, I thought
you all were together.

52:41.112 --> 52:42.112
- [Anna] No.

52:52.076 --> 52:53.465
Ooh, that stings.

52:53.465 --> 52:57.632
I just wish people wouldn't
just, like, wander off.

53:01.579 --> 53:02.862
I don't think why, I
don't know why they think

53:02.862 --> 53:05.094
they can just like, be
like, oh, okay, great,

53:05.094 --> 53:07.084
we'll just go out own way, you know?

53:07.084 --> 53:11.866
Then it's like, no dude,
we're all in this together,

53:11.866 --> 53:16.033
like, why would you just like,
think you could, whatever.

53:17.549 --> 53:19.471
- [Jonah] Well, I just wanna
get some shots, you know?

53:19.471 --> 53:20.564
While everyone's doing shit.

53:20.564 --> 53:22.409
- [Anna] Yeah, I know, but
I bet 10 bucks no one else

53:22.409 --> 53:25.242
has their headcams on or anything.

53:42.660 --> 53:44.327
Where are you going?

53:48.451 --> 53:49.284
- [Jonah] Yeah?

53:49.284 --> 53:50.286
- [Anna] Where are you going?

53:50.286 --> 53:52.203
- [Jonah] I don't know.

53:59.336 --> 54:02.169
(heavy breathing)

54:03.110 --> 54:04.255
- [Jonah] Dude, you getting anything?

54:04.255 --> 54:05.427
- Oh no, I wanna, shh.

54:05.427 --> 54:06.275
- [Jonah] Sorry.

54:06.275 --> 54:07.442
- That's cool.

54:16.827 --> 54:17.887
- [Jonah] What's wrong?

54:17.887 --> 54:19.525
- I don't know, I thought
I heard something.

54:19.525 --> 54:20.358
Hold on.

54:21.653 --> 54:23.422
It's real staticky, dude, I don't know.

54:23.422 --> 54:24.563
- [Jonah] Staticky?

54:24.563 --> 54:27.326
- Man, I don't know, this
is such a piece of shit.

54:27.326 --> 54:30.323
Okay, that looks good, all right.

54:30.323 --> 54:32.307
If there's any ghosts in
here, please show yourselves.

54:32.307 --> 54:34.059
- [Jonah] Hello?

54:34.059 --> 54:35.610
We don't mean to harm you,

54:35.610 --> 54:38.046
we just want to see if you're out here.

54:38.046 --> 54:39.689
Any ghosts in the area?

54:39.689 --> 54:41.281
- Hey Jonah, over here.

54:41.281 --> 54:42.139
- [Jonah] What, are you getting something?

54:42.139 --> 54:43.972
All right, yeah, yeah.

54:44.830 --> 54:47.663
- [Ky] All right, one, two, three.

54:51.374 --> 54:52.948
Man.

54:52.948 --> 54:53.781
No way.

54:54.743 --> 54:55.715
Are you sure that thing's working?

54:55.715 --> 54:57.518
- [Jonah] Dude, you can check it yourself.

54:57.518 --> 55:00.685
- [Ky] All right, let's see this shit.

55:03.019 --> 55:05.419
- [Jonah] All right,
um, can you look back?

55:05.419 --> 55:07.169
What's wrong with it?

55:08.572 --> 55:12.405
- [Ky] All right, well,
it's working, it's on.

55:13.367 --> 55:14.650
- [Jonah] Where are you getting that?

55:14.650 --> 55:17.733
- [Ky] Here, I'll get it right there.

55:18.930 --> 55:19.763
- [Jonah] Man, this is fucking dumb,

55:19.763 --> 55:20.828
are we sure they were here?

55:20.828 --> 55:22.245
- [Ky] Yes, dude.

55:24.695 --> 55:26.945
(clapping)

55:27.939 --> 55:29.003
- [Jonah] Dude, whatever man.

55:29.003 --> 55:30.449
Let's just try to find everybody else.

55:30.449 --> 55:31.301
- [Ky] Okay, maybe they found something,

55:31.301 --> 55:32.384
I don't know.

55:34.695 --> 55:36.414
- [Ky] Hey guys.
- [Jonah] Hello.

55:36.414 --> 55:37.640
- [Ky] Where in the hell are y'all?

55:37.640 --> 55:38.890
- [Jonah] Guys!

55:40.719 --> 55:43.636
- [Ky] All right, they're not here.

55:48.515 --> 55:49.744
Hey, guys!

55:49.744 --> 55:52.283
- [Jonah] You go outside and, all right.

55:52.283 --> 55:54.254
- [Ky] It oughta get dark.

55:54.254 --> 55:55.272
- [Jonah] Dude, I don't know.

55:55.272 --> 55:56.105
- [Ky] Going over here?

55:56.105 --> 55:57.355
- [Jonah] Yeah.

55:59.228 --> 56:01.647
Man, they're not out here.

56:01.647 --> 56:02.480
- [Gavin] Yo.

56:02.480 --> 56:03.313
- [Jonah] God almighty.

56:03.313 --> 56:04.213
- [Anna] You guys seen Gen?

56:04.213 --> 56:05.380
- [Ky] No, I thought she was with y'all.

56:05.380 --> 56:06.776
- Obviously, she's not.

56:06.776 --> 56:08.105
- Well, no, that's because he was too busy

56:08.105 --> 56:10.002
trying to scare the shit
out of me and Misty, so.

56:10.002 --> 56:10.848
- Yeah, whatever, whatever.

56:10.848 --> 56:12.085
- [Ky] Speaking of Misty, where is she?

56:12.085 --> 56:13.343
- [Gavin] We left her
- [Anna] We left her upstairs

56:13.343 --> 56:14.484
- [Gavin] upstairs somewhere.
- [Anna] in the bedroom.

56:14.484 --> 56:15.506
- [Ky] Perfect, I'm gonna see

56:15.506 --> 56:16.535
if she's okay all alone.

56:16.535 --> 56:18.403
- Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo,
Misty isn't lost, Gen is.

56:18.403 --> 56:19.473
- Dude, your woman, your problem.

56:19.473 --> 56:20.627
Misty all alone up there?

56:20.627 --> 56:21.561
My problem solved.

56:21.561 --> 56:23.515
- Hold on, don't you need her wasted

56:23.515 --> 56:24.680
like all your other conquests?

56:24.680 --> 56:25.861
- Ha! No, but if it was you,

56:25.861 --> 56:27.963
I would definitely have to be wasted.

56:27.963 --> 56:30.082
- [Jonah] Look, forget him, honestly,

56:30.082 --> 56:31.611
we need to find Gen.

56:31.611 --> 56:32.807
- No, no, no, I'm going to look for Gen.

56:32.807 --> 56:34.179
You guys just stay here and keep looking.

56:34.179 --> 56:35.139
She's probably outside somewhere.

56:35.139 --> 56:37.075
- [Jonah] Why the hell would
she be outside by herself?

56:37.075 --> 56:38.576
- Listen here, Jonah, I'm
getting sick and tired

56:38.576 --> 56:40.349
of you telling me what the
hell she would or would not do.

56:40.349 --> 56:42.242
Whatever you had in the
past, that's all in the past.

56:42.242 --> 56:45.378
- Okay, guys, all this arguing
really isn't gonna find Gen.

56:45.378 --> 56:46.918
- [Jonah] She's right.

56:46.918 --> 56:48.885
- Don't worry about it.
I'mma go look, and oh.

56:48.885 --> 56:50.257
- [Jonah] Yeah, take
your happy ass out there.

56:50.257 --> 56:51.230
- [Anna] Stop it, Jonah.

56:51.230 --> 56:52.132
- [Gavin] I'll deal with your ass later.

56:52.132 --> 56:55.059
- [Jonah] All right, cupcake.

56:55.059 --> 56:56.032
- Why are you doing this?

56:56.032 --> 56:57.669
It's obvious that every time
you say something about Gen

56:57.669 --> 56:59.069
it pushes his buttons.

56:59.069 --> 56:59.953
- [Jonah] I'm just trying to find her

56:59.953 --> 57:01.517
like everybody else, all right?

57:01.517 --> 57:03.452
She's made her choice and I accept it.

57:03.452 --> 57:05.370
- I understand that,
however, all this arguing

57:05.370 --> 57:07.054
isn't gonna get the project done

57:07.054 --> 57:09.906
and I honestly think that Gen's patience

57:09.906 --> 57:12.490
is kinda wearing thin with his, like, uh

57:12.490 --> 57:13.888
[Anna] Macho or whatever.
- [Jonah] Okay, fine, fine.

57:13.888 --> 57:16.388
Let's just go inside, come on.

57:23.888 --> 57:24.721
(knocking on door)

57:24.721 --> 57:26.280
- [Ky] Open up.

57:26.280 --> 57:27.389
You dressed, Misty?

57:27.389 --> 57:28.556
Sure hope not.

57:29.853 --> 57:31.526
Where are you?

57:31.526 --> 57:33.502
Okay, come with everyone else.

57:33.502 --> 57:35.085
Misty, you in here?

58:08.740 --> 58:10.990
(thumping)

58:14.513 --> 58:15.680
- [Gavin] Gen!

58:17.426 --> 58:18.259
Genevieve!

58:19.592 --> 58:22.177
Come on girl, I know you're out here.

58:22.177 --> 58:23.419
You better not be out here with Jonah,

58:23.419 --> 58:25.689
pissed the fuck off.

58:25.689 --> 58:26.522
Genevieve!

58:31.152 --> 58:34.081
Girl, I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to say what I said before.

58:34.081 --> 58:36.477
You know how I get upset sometimes.

58:36.477 --> 58:38.644
You know I'm easily angry.

58:39.672 --> 58:41.612
(sighing)

58:41.612 --> 58:44.112
Let me just make it up to you.

58:46.387 --> 58:47.692
Genevieve!

58:47.692 --> 58:50.192
For real though, where you at?

58:51.384 --> 58:55.551
Man, this girl got me worried,
where the hell is she at?

58:57.480 --> 58:58.737
Baby, just sit there and talk to me.

58:58.737 --> 58:59.926
Please, just give me a second to talk.

58:59.926 --> 59:03.894
I just wanna go ahead and take
the time to just apologize

59:03.894 --> 59:07.894
for being an asshole, for
being stupid and dumb.

59:09.712 --> 59:12.795
I mean, I know how you get sometimes,

59:13.946 --> 59:16.243
but don't treat me like
this, don't do me like that.

59:16.243 --> 59:17.076
Gen!

59:18.472 --> 59:21.129
Girl, I know you hear me.

59:21.129 --> 59:23.379
(crashing)

59:25.776 --> 59:27.859
(static)

59:56.915 --> 59:59.498
(creepy music)

01:00:00.771 --> 01:00:03.877
(car door opening)

01:00:03.877 --> 01:00:06.544
(motor revving)

01:00:18.151 --> 01:00:19.588
- [Ky] Anna, did you hear that?

01:00:19.588 --> 01:00:21.130
- What the hell was that noise?

01:00:21.130 --> 01:00:22.147
- What the fuck, man, what was that?

01:00:22.147 --> 01:00:22.980
- [Anna] I don't know.

01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:24.709
- It was loud as hell.

01:00:24.709 --> 01:00:25.542
- [Jonah] Is Misty still up there?

01:00:25.542 --> 01:00:27.188
- No, I couldn't find her.

01:00:27.188 --> 01:00:28.697
- This is getting weird.

01:00:28.697 --> 01:00:30.358
- Well, maybe the bogeyman
got her or something.

01:00:30.358 --> 01:00:31.191
I don't know.

01:00:31.191 --> 01:00:32.605
- Do you always have to be so stupid?

01:00:32.605 --> 01:00:34.111
- [Jonah] Guys, look,
our friends are missing,

01:00:34.111 --> 01:00:35.582
Gavin's still not back yet,

01:00:35.582 --> 01:00:37.409
let's just split up
and be back here in 15.

01:00:37.409 --> 01:00:38.757
- All right, cool,
yeah, I'll be back here.

01:00:38.757 --> 01:00:41.274
- No, no, no, we should all stay together.

01:00:41.274 --> 01:00:43.468
- What for? Misty and Gen
are probably together,

01:00:43.468 --> 01:00:44.546
Gavin'll be back here in a minute,

01:00:44.546 --> 01:00:45.744
let's just go.

01:00:45.744 --> 01:00:46.577
- [Jonah] Look, he's right.

01:00:46.577 --> 01:00:48.682
Let's go, come with me,
we'll be back here in 15.

01:00:48.682 --> 01:00:51.472
- Yeah, all right, cool. See you guys.

01:00:51.472 --> 01:00:52.715
- [Anna] Something is not right.

01:00:52.715 --> 01:00:55.009
Gavin and Misty would
never split up like this.

01:00:55.009 --> 01:00:55.898
You know that.

01:00:55.898 --> 01:00:57.148
- [Jonah] Anna.

01:00:58.990 --> 01:01:01.664
- [Ky] Misty! Genevieve!

01:01:01.664 --> 01:01:04.510
Where are these fucking girls?

01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:05.343
God dang.

01:01:06.482 --> 01:01:07.648
Down here.

01:01:07.648 --> 01:01:09.815
Misty, Gen, you down here?

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.368
Yo, quit fucking around.

01:01:12.368 --> 01:01:13.201
Come on.

01:01:14.289 --> 01:01:17.039
God, it's dark as shit down here.

01:01:21.537 --> 01:01:23.787
(thumping)

01:01:29.452 --> 01:01:30.788
- Where is everyone?

01:01:30.788 --> 01:01:32.755
Missing, this is fucking stupid.

01:01:32.755 --> 01:01:34.299
- [Jonah] Now this is stupid.

01:01:34.299 --> 01:01:36.055
But when I said something earlier,

01:01:36.055 --> 01:01:38.056
what about then?

01:01:38.056 --> 01:01:40.432
- Fine, as soon as Gavin
gets back, we'll go.

01:01:40.432 --> 01:01:42.599
- [Jonah] Sounds great, can't wait.

01:01:42.599 --> 01:01:43.682
- Gavin! Gen!

01:01:46.166 --> 01:01:47.066
Genevieve!

01:01:47.066 --> 01:01:50.483
- [Jonah] Hey, I think I heard something.

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:54.862
- What's that noise?

01:01:54.862 --> 01:01:57.123
- [Jonah] It came from
downstairs, I don't know.

01:01:57.123 --> 01:01:58.172
- We should go.

01:01:58.172 --> 01:01:59.774
- [Jonah] Wait, wait, look.

01:01:59.774 --> 01:02:02.184
We don't know what the fuck's going on.

01:02:02.184 --> 01:02:03.516
I think it's better that we just stay here

01:02:03.516 --> 01:02:04.992
and wait for the others.

01:02:04.992 --> 01:02:06.531
- That's one of our friends down there,

01:02:06.531 --> 01:02:08.343
he needs our help, then we should go.

01:02:08.343 --> 01:02:11.737
- [Jonah] Goddammit,
this is fucking stupid.

01:02:11.737 --> 01:02:13.120
- If it was you down there,
you would want someone

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.287
to help you, wouldn't you?

01:02:18.251 --> 01:02:19.834
- [Jonah] Fuck you.

01:02:23.515 --> 01:02:26.592
This is such a dumbass idea.

01:02:26.592 --> 01:02:27.670
Anna!

01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:28.899
- What?

01:02:28.899 --> 01:02:29.806
- [Jonah] Let's just go.

01:02:29.806 --> 01:02:32.745
- No! We're going this way!

01:02:32.745 --> 01:02:34.183
- [Jonah] It's just the fucking wind.

01:02:34.183 --> 01:02:35.100
- Let's go.

01:02:36.145 --> 01:02:39.145
I think I heard something down here.

01:02:45.375 --> 01:02:48.208
- Oh my, oh my god, what the fuck?

01:02:49.262 --> 01:02:50.095
- [Jonah] Holy shit!

01:02:50.095 --> 01:02:52.428
(screaming)

01:02:54.686 --> 01:02:57.258
(thumping)

01:02:57.258 --> 01:02:58.336
- [Jonah] What was that?

01:02:58.336 --> 01:03:00.169
Let's get out of here.

01:03:01.330 --> 01:03:03.688
Fuck you, let me out of here.

01:03:03.688 --> 01:03:05.085
- [Anna] Ky, please!

01:03:05.085 --> 01:03:06.690
- [Jonah] What the fuck?

01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:08.690
- [Anna] Please, please.

01:03:10.233 --> 01:03:11.936
- [Jonah] What the fuck?

01:03:11.936 --> 01:03:12.769
Fuck this.

01:03:14.281 --> 01:03:16.263
- [Anna] No, don't do it.

01:03:16.263 --> 01:03:17.680
- [Jonah] Ky, Ky.

01:03:20.435 --> 01:03:22.493
(explosion)

01:03:22.493 --> 01:03:23.894
- [Jonah] What the fuck was that?

01:03:23.894 --> 01:03:27.793
- [Anna] Think, think,
who else could it be?

01:03:27.793 --> 01:03:29.189
It's the old guy with the keys.

01:03:29.189 --> 01:03:30.022
- [Jonah] I don't fucking know, Anna,

01:03:30.022 --> 01:03:31.180
but I'm getting us out of here, all right?

01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:34.013
(banging on door)

01:03:34.904 --> 01:03:37.612
- [Anna] I need to find everyone else.

01:03:37.612 --> 01:03:39.362
- Anna, are you okay?

01:03:41.336 --> 01:03:42.361
You're shaking.

01:03:42.361 --> 01:03:43.212
Did you hear that?

01:03:43.212 --> 01:03:44.875
- [Anna] Don't!

01:03:44.875 --> 01:03:47.157
- [Jonah] I saw him.

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:48.756
(crying)

01:03:48.756 --> 01:03:49.951
- [Jonah] It's okay, it's okay.

01:03:49.951 --> 01:03:51.633
- [Anna] Jonah!

01:03:51.633 --> 01:03:54.910
- [Jonah] It's okay, it's okay.

01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:57.410
Look, listen to me, all right?

01:03:59.855 --> 01:04:04.163
I'm gonna get us fucking
out of here, all right?

01:04:04.163 --> 01:04:07.163
It's gonna be okay, okay, all right.

01:04:09.010 --> 01:04:11.427
I'm gonna get us out of here.

01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:17.239
(heavy breathing)

01:04:17.239 --> 01:04:19.156
What the fuck was that?

01:04:21.707 --> 01:04:22.671
- [Anna] Oh my god.

01:04:22.671 --> 01:04:23.921
- [Jonah] Shit.

01:04:25.765 --> 01:04:28.182
(whimpering)

01:04:30.018 --> 01:04:31.659
- [Anna] Be careful.

01:04:31.659 --> 01:04:32.676
- [Jonah] I'm gonna get us out of here.

01:04:32.676 --> 01:04:35.009
(screaming)

01:04:44.666 --> 01:04:46.123
(knocking on door)

01:04:46.123 --> 01:04:48.431
- [Jonah] All right, listen to me.

01:04:48.431 --> 01:04:50.098
- [Anna] What? What?

01:04:51.744 --> 01:04:54.159
- [Jonah] We gotta meet him down there.

01:04:54.159 --> 01:04:56.969
Just follow my lead, we
need to find the other side.

01:04:56.969 --> 01:04:57.802
- [Anna] Please.

01:04:57.802 --> 01:04:58.635
- [Jonah] Get the hell out of here.

01:04:58.635 --> 01:05:00.381
- [Anna] Jonah, be careful, Jonah.

01:05:00.381 --> 01:05:02.548
Please be careful, please.

01:05:11.188 --> 01:05:12.385
- [Jonah] Now let's go find Gen and Misty

01:05:12.385 --> 01:05:14.052
and get out of here.

01:05:16.956 --> 01:05:17.971
- [Anna] Jonah, wait!

01:05:17.971 --> 01:05:19.202
- [Jonah] Let's go, come on.

01:05:19.202 --> 01:05:21.369
(panting)

01:05:23.458 --> 01:05:24.749
Anna, let's go, this way.

01:05:24.749 --> 01:05:25.582
Come on!

01:05:27.365 --> 01:05:28.963
- [Anna] Jonah, slow down!

01:05:28.963 --> 01:05:30.546
- [Jonah] Let's go!

01:05:32.364 --> 01:05:34.551
(creepy music)

01:05:34.551 --> 01:05:35.439
- [Anna] What was that?

01:05:35.439 --> 01:05:37.476
- [Jonah] Nothing, let's move.

01:05:37.476 --> 01:05:38.309
Come on.

01:05:39.438 --> 01:05:40.271
Aw, shit.

01:05:41.843 --> 01:05:42.876
(shrieking)

01:05:42.876 --> 01:05:43.766
What?

01:05:43.766 --> 01:05:45.801
- [Anna] I don't know, I
don't know, I don't know.

01:05:45.801 --> 01:05:47.432
- [Jonah] Shit, fuck!

01:05:47.432 --> 01:05:48.599
- [Anna] Wait!

01:05:51.993 --> 01:05:54.730
- [Jonah] Anna, come on!

01:05:54.730 --> 01:05:57.707
What's that, are you okay?

01:05:57.707 --> 01:05:59.469
- [Anna] There's a hole right there.

01:05:59.469 --> 01:06:01.636
(panting)

01:06:06.151 --> 01:06:08.493
- [Jonah] Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.

01:06:08.493 --> 01:06:11.237
Okay, let's go, follow me.

01:06:11.237 --> 01:06:12.655
- [Anna] Where is he?

01:06:12.655 --> 01:06:14.822
(panting)

01:06:16.892 --> 01:06:17.902
- [Jonah] Careful.

01:06:17.902 --> 01:06:20.069
(panting)

01:06:22.978 --> 01:06:24.696
- [Anna] Girls!

01:06:24.696 --> 01:06:27.517
(screaming)

01:06:27.517 --> 01:06:28.767
- [Anna] Jonah!

01:06:31.625 --> 01:06:32.833
- [Jonah] I'm in a prickle bush.

01:06:32.833 --> 01:06:34.250
- [Anna] Come on.

01:06:37.112 --> 01:06:38.259
(shrieking)

01:06:38.259 --> 01:06:39.092
- [Jonah] What?

01:06:39.092 --> 01:06:40.509
- [Anna] Charles!

01:06:43.790 --> 01:06:46.286
Jonah, the van's around here somewhere.

01:06:46.286 --> 01:06:47.786
It was right here.

01:06:50.410 --> 01:06:52.247
- [Jonah] Where the fuck is the van?

01:06:52.247 --> 01:06:53.747
- [Anna] It was --

01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:58.190
- [Jonah] I parked it right here, Anna.

01:06:59.384 --> 01:07:02.287
- No, you didn't, no, you didn't.

01:07:02.287 --> 01:07:03.218
- [Jonah] The fuck are you doing?

01:07:03.218 --> 01:07:04.610
I parked it right here, yes, I did.

01:07:04.610 --> 01:07:06.109
- [Anna] No, you didn't, no, you didn't.

01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:07.014
- [Jonah] Charles!

01:07:07.014 --> 01:07:10.698
- [Anna] No, no, this is, you didn't --

01:07:10.698 --> 01:07:12.519
This isn't right.

01:07:12.519 --> 01:07:14.454
- [Jonah] I left it here.

01:07:14.454 --> 01:07:15.539
Charles!

01:07:15.539 --> 01:07:16.956
- [Anna] Charles!

01:07:19.044 --> 01:07:21.273
Let's go back to the house, come on.

01:07:21.273 --> 01:07:23.220
- [Jonah] What are you doing?

01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:24.328
- [Anna] Going back to the house!

01:07:24.328 --> 01:07:25.161
- [Jonah] Are you kidding me?

01:07:25.161 --> 01:07:26.457
You're gonna go back to the house.

01:07:26.457 --> 01:07:28.704
- [Anna] Yes I can, why not?

01:07:28.704 --> 01:07:30.940
- [Jonah] Why not? I can give
you so many reasons why not.

01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:32.666
You know what's in there.

01:07:32.666 --> 01:07:33.531
All right?

01:07:33.531 --> 01:07:34.843
You saw what happened to Ky.

01:07:34.843 --> 01:07:36.828
Doors don't just close
by themselves, Anna.

01:07:36.828 --> 01:07:38.395
There is something in that house.

01:07:38.395 --> 01:07:40.536
- No, and you know what's safer?

01:07:40.536 --> 01:07:44.664
To be in there than it is
to be out here right now.

01:07:44.664 --> 01:07:46.681
I can't keep wandering
in the woods with you.

01:07:46.681 --> 01:07:50.848
I can't do it, I can't, I'm
out of breath, I'm tired.

01:07:54.563 --> 01:07:58.480
- [Jonah] Anna, you don't
know what's in there.

01:08:01.428 --> 01:08:04.178
- Please, please, please, please.

01:08:08.339 --> 01:08:10.405
How do you know?

01:08:10.405 --> 01:08:11.274
- [Jonah] I don't.

01:08:11.274 --> 01:08:14.941
- That whatever is in
there isn't out there.

01:08:19.082 --> 01:08:21.134
How do you know?

01:08:21.134 --> 01:08:23.189
My lights aren't working.

01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:24.437
We have no fucking light.

01:08:24.437 --> 01:08:25.944
We're out in the middle of nowhere.

01:08:25.944 --> 01:08:28.046
We've probably passed this
place five million times

01:08:28.046 --> 01:08:29.712
and we just now looked at it.

01:08:29.712 --> 01:08:32.630
- [Jonah] Okay, we'll go, let's go.

01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:36.968
- [Anna] Oh my god.

01:08:36.968 --> 01:08:38.252
- [Jonah] Hold this.

01:08:38.252 --> 01:08:39.545
- [Anna] I knew it was him.

01:08:39.545 --> 01:08:40.631
He said there was something wrong with it

01:08:40.631 --> 01:08:42.732
so he could come back and kill us.

01:08:42.732 --> 01:08:44.899
Jonah, what are you doing?

01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:51.317
Dude, what, what is it?

01:08:51.317 --> 01:08:53.305
Jonah, what is it?

01:08:53.305 --> 01:08:54.984
- Let's go.

01:08:54.984 --> 01:08:57.444
- [Anna] Jonah, what is it?

01:08:57.444 --> 01:08:58.856
Tell me what it is!

01:08:58.856 --> 01:09:01.106
- [Jonah] It's Gavin, okay?

01:09:04.250 --> 01:09:05.519
Gen.

01:09:05.519 --> 01:09:06.957
- [Anna] Gen, come on, we gotta go.

01:09:06.957 --> 01:09:08.238
- [Jonah] Gen, look,
I'm sorry about Gavin.

01:09:08.238 --> 01:09:09.255
We just need to get the
hell out of here now.

01:09:09.255 --> 01:09:11.587
(screaming)

01:09:13.439 --> 01:09:14.999
- [Anna] Something's not
right, can't find Misty!

01:09:14.999 --> 01:09:16.185
- [Jonah] Misty! Go upstairs!

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:18.238
Misty, where are you?

01:09:18.238 --> 01:09:20.062
- [Anna] Misty!

01:09:20.062 --> 01:09:22.002
Holy shit, come on.

01:09:22.002 --> 01:09:23.252
- [Anna] Misty!

01:09:25.416 --> 01:09:26.542
(crashing)

01:09:26.542 --> 01:09:28.750
(screaming)

01:09:28.750 --> 01:09:29.582
- [Jonah] Holy shit!

01:09:29.582 --> 01:09:30.585
Go, go, go, go!

01:09:30.585 --> 01:09:31.939
(screaming)

01:09:31.939 --> 01:09:32.981
(crashing)

01:09:32.981 --> 01:09:35.314
(screaming)

01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:46.913
- [Jonah] Whatever the hell
this guy, or this thing is,

01:09:46.913 --> 01:09:48.997
we'll just call for help.

01:09:52.448 --> 01:09:55.615
- [Anna] Charles, if you can see this,

01:09:57.204 --> 01:09:59.787
please, please, please help me.

01:10:03.477 --> 01:10:05.716
Please help, please.

01:10:05.716 --> 01:10:08.872
- [Jonah] Look, you stay in here.

01:10:08.872 --> 01:10:10.716
I'm gonna lock the door,

01:10:10.716 --> 01:10:13.800
and we'll see what the
hell's going on down there.

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:15.616
- Don't go down there, please.

01:10:15.616 --> 01:10:18.104
Please don't go down there.

01:10:18.104 --> 01:10:19.871
- [Jonah] I have to.

01:10:19.871 --> 01:10:21.926
I don't know if we're gonna make this.

01:10:21.926 --> 01:10:23.917
And Misty's still in trouble.

01:10:23.917 --> 01:10:25.727
- Misty's dead!

01:10:25.727 --> 01:10:27.740
Everyone's dead!

01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:30.614
- [Jonah] You don't know that.

01:10:30.614 --> 01:10:32.837
And Gen is still out there.

01:10:32.837 --> 01:10:34.413
All right?

01:10:34.413 --> 01:10:36.259
- That wasn't Gen.

01:10:36.259 --> 01:10:38.326
I don't know who that was.

01:10:38.326 --> 01:10:39.608
- [Jonah] It's this fucking place.

01:10:39.608 --> 01:10:41.770
We should have never came here.

01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:45.248
But you have to stay with me, okay?

01:10:45.248 --> 01:10:46.415
Lock the door.

01:10:47.833 --> 01:10:48.958
I'll be back.

01:10:48.958 --> 01:10:50.065
- Please don't.

01:10:50.065 --> 01:10:52.482
- Just lock the door, please.

01:11:00.828 --> 01:11:02.411
Anna, I'll be back.

01:11:07.093 --> 01:11:07.926
I promise.

01:11:18.588 --> 01:11:19.421
Stop it.

01:11:22.138 --> 01:11:22.971
I promise.

01:11:24.172 --> 01:11:26.255
(crying)

01:11:28.697 --> 01:11:31.714
(thumping)

01:11:31.714 --> 01:11:33.797
(crying)

01:12:03.224 --> 01:12:06.514
(kicking door)

01:12:06.514 --> 01:12:07.501
(screaming)

01:12:07.501 --> 01:12:11.084
- Stop, stop, stop,
please, please, please.

01:12:12.755 --> 01:12:15.005
(chanting)

01:12:20.227 --> 01:12:21.560
- Gen, Gen, Gen?

01:12:25.559 --> 01:12:26.392
(groaning)

01:12:26.392 --> 01:12:29.142
(bones breaking)

01:12:37.488 --> 01:12:40.431
(thumping)

01:12:40.431 --> 01:12:42.667
- [Voiceover] Anna, Anna, it's me.

01:12:42.667 --> 01:12:44.158
(thumping)

01:12:44.158 --> 01:12:45.031
- [Anna] Jonah?

01:12:45.031 --> 01:12:47.031
- [Jonah] Open the door.

01:12:50.342 --> 01:12:51.425
- [Anna] Gen.

01:12:52.783 --> 01:12:55.150
(screaming)

01:12:55.150 --> 01:12:57.400
(thumping)

01:12:58.719 --> 01:13:01.052
(screaming)

01:13:07.864 --> 01:13:10.346
- I'm standing in front
of the Lafitte Plantation

01:13:10.346 --> 01:13:12.757
here in Vacherie, Louisiana,
where we are investigating

01:13:12.757 --> 01:13:16.959
the possible homicide of
six university students.

01:13:16.959 --> 01:13:20.240
While it is unclear exactly
what events took place here,

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:23.729
there is definitely a somber
presence with us today.

01:13:23.729 --> 01:13:26.693
Local police have yet to
release any information

01:13:26.693 --> 01:13:30.860
regarding the names of the
students or possible suspects.

01:13:33.197 --> 01:13:36.911
- So what you just saw is what we all saw.

01:13:36.911 --> 01:13:39.599
And we're asking anyone
who can give us any details

01:13:39.599 --> 01:13:42.109
regarding her whereabouts to come forward

01:13:42.109 --> 01:13:45.672
and inform the local
police as soon as possible.

01:13:45.672 --> 01:13:47.873
And on behalf of my family, we apologize

01:13:47.873 --> 01:13:52.020
and our hearts go out to
the families of the victims.

01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:54.219
I will leave you with
the last known footage

01:13:54.219 --> 01:13:56.702
we have of my sister.

01:13:56.702 --> 01:13:59.075
And if you do come in contact with her,

01:13:59.075 --> 01:14:00.908
approach with caution.

01:14:13.864 --> 01:14:15.364
- Why'd you do it?

01:14:16.227 --> 01:14:20.475
- I told you guys several
times before, I did not do it.

01:14:20.475 --> 01:14:24.475
I'm so confused, I don't
even know why I'm here.

01:14:25.372 --> 01:14:27.969
I don't know what happened,
I told the whole truth.

01:14:27.969 --> 01:14:28.851
I did not do it.

01:14:28.851 --> 01:14:29.684
- They were your friends.

01:14:29.684 --> 01:14:30.517
- I'm not --

01:14:30.517 --> 01:14:33.267
- Why did you murder your friends?

01:14:33.267 --> 01:14:35.691
- I didn't murder my
friends, they were my,

01:14:35.691 --> 01:14:37.152
I wouldn't do that to my friends.

01:14:37.152 --> 01:14:38.730
- So you're sure you knew to --

01:14:38.730 --> 01:14:40.063
- No, I did not.

01:14:43.481 --> 01:14:45.555
I'm so confused right now.

01:14:45.555 --> 01:14:50.049
- Forensics report places
your DNA on the murder scene.

01:14:50.049 --> 01:14:51.535
- We were there.

01:14:51.535 --> 01:14:53.193
- It places your DNA.

01:14:53.193 --> 01:14:55.693
- I explained why I was there.

01:14:56.527 --> 01:15:00.390
I was there, I know that,
because when I woke up,

01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:02.726
I was there, we were there for a project.

01:15:02.726 --> 01:15:03.911
- Which, where were you?

01:15:03.911 --> 01:15:04.937
Were you in the home?

01:15:04.937 --> 01:15:05.770
- I was by myself.

01:15:05.770 --> 01:15:06.619
- You was by yourself.

01:15:06.619 --> 01:15:07.452
- Yeah.

01:15:07.452 --> 01:15:08.766
- When you killed her,
were you by yourself then?

01:15:08.766 --> 01:15:10.534
- No, I didn't kill these people.

01:15:10.534 --> 01:15:13.253
(arguing)

01:15:13.253 --> 01:15:15.494
- I would never do my friends like that,

01:15:15.494 --> 01:15:16.941
I wouldn't do anybody like that

01:15:16.941 --> 01:15:18.241
that is not who I am,

01:15:18.241 --> 01:15:19.709
I'm not that person.

01:15:19.709 --> 01:15:21.813
Y'all got the wrong person.

01:15:21.813 --> 01:15:24.063
I am not her, I am not her.

01:15:25.349 --> 01:15:28.138
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry,
y'all have the wrong person.

01:15:28.138 --> 01:15:30.264
- Unless you start talking --

01:15:30.264 --> 01:15:31.351
- I'm not the --

01:15:31.351 --> 01:15:34.970
- This is gonna get really
fucking bad for you.

01:15:34.970 --> 01:15:37.076
- Sir, those are my friends, too.

01:15:37.076 --> 01:15:38.800
They were my friends there.

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:40.211
- What happened to them?

01:15:40.211 --> 01:15:42.791
- I don't, I cannot remember that evening.

01:15:42.791 --> 01:15:45.009
I cannot, the last thing I remember,

01:15:45.009 --> 01:15:46.702
I was, I woke up.

01:15:46.702 --> 01:15:50.614
- Why were you in the
woods in the first place?

01:15:50.614 --> 01:15:52.614
Why, why were you there?

01:15:53.454 --> 01:15:55.306
- I can't give you
anything, I don't remember.

01:15:55.306 --> 01:15:57.137
- But you remember being there?

01:15:57.137 --> 01:16:00.325
- I remember us driving there

01:16:00.325 --> 01:16:01.879
and I remember the drive there.

01:16:01.879 --> 01:16:04.627
Everything after that is a complete blur.

01:16:04.627 --> 01:16:06.782
I won't recollect any more, I cannot.

01:16:06.782 --> 01:16:08.810
That was all that I know.

01:16:08.810 --> 01:16:10.250
- You're guilty!

01:16:10.250 --> 01:16:12.692
You're guilty and you know it!

01:16:12.692 --> 01:16:14.249
We've got you now.

01:16:14.249 --> 01:16:16.332
(crying)

01:16:17.408 --> 01:16:19.741
(screaming)

01:16:23.127 --> 01:16:25.710
(creepy music)
