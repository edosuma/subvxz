01:56.000 --> 01:58.033
<i>My name is Anthony Sadler.</i>

01:58.035 --> 01:59.634
<i>You're probably wondering
why a brother like me</i>

01:59.636 --> 02:01.402
<i>is hanging out
with these two crackers.</i>

02:01.404 --> 02:04.239
<i>But trust me,
they're my two closest friends.</i>

02:04.241 --> 02:05.275
<i>Let me introduce you.</i>

02:05.277 --> 02:07.742
<i>This is Alek Skarlatos,
the robot.</i>

02:07.744 --> 02:09.411
<i>He's a strong guy.</i>

02:09.413 --> 02:11.013
<i>He'll always have your back
whenever you're in trouble.</i>

02:11.014 --> 02:13.081
<i>And this is Spencer Stone.</i>

02:13.083 --> 02:14.883
<i>You don't have to worry about
him having your back</i>

02:14.885 --> 02:17.819
<i>in trouble because I'm sure
he'll find it first.</i>

02:17.821 --> 02:19.488
<i>Seems like the three of us
have been</i>

02:19.490 --> 02:21.623
<i>gettin' each other in trouble
ever since middle school.</i>

02:21.625 --> 02:25.297
<i>But let me take you back and
show you how it all began...</i>

02:41.646 --> 02:44.379
Oh. Hi!

02:44.381 --> 02:45.614
Ms. Eskel?

02:45.616 --> 02:47.716
Yeah, hi.
I'm Spencer Stone's mother.

02:47.718 --> 02:49.718
This is Heidi,
Alek Skarlatos' mom.

02:49.720 --> 02:54.257
Oh. I'm sorry, I didn't think
we were meeting until 3:15.

02:54.259 --> 02:56.025
Yes. Well, um,

02:56.027 --> 02:59.628
we had some similar concerns.
So...

02:59.630 --> 03:02.465
Thought we'd join forces.

03:02.467 --> 03:03.764
Um, well, I...

03:03.766 --> 03:05.367
We're concerned, I guess,

03:05.369 --> 03:07.536
with the boys
starting junior high.

03:07.538 --> 03:09.170
- Rightfully so.
- Yeah.

03:09.172 --> 03:10.805
Uh, we've noticed
some bullying

03:10.807 --> 03:12.008
with the classmates,

03:12.010 --> 03:13.575
and we were worried
it might be

03:13.577 --> 03:14.977
affecting their school work.

03:14.979 --> 03:18.116
Ms. Eskel. Ms. Skarlatos.
May I be quite frank?

03:19.182 --> 03:21.751
Spencer is behind
on his reading.

03:21.753 --> 03:22.984
Very behind.

03:22.986 --> 03:26.355
And Alek is
too easily distracted.

03:26.357 --> 03:29.295
Has anyone ever discussed
ADD with you two?

03:29.861 --> 03:31.359
In my opinion,

03:31.361 --> 03:32.929
both Spencer and Alek suffer
from something called

03:32.931 --> 03:36.032
Attention Deficit Disorder,
ADD.

03:36.034 --> 03:37.665
Do you think that
you might be jumping

03:37.667 --> 03:39.200
to this conclusion
too quickly?

03:39.202 --> 03:41.470
It's not a quick jump,
Ms. Eskel.

03:41.472 --> 03:42.771
As I previously mentioned,

03:42.773 --> 03:44.907
Spencer cannot concentrate
on his reading.

03:44.909 --> 03:46.341
Well,
that might be my fault.

03:46.343 --> 03:48.277
Now that I know
he's falling behind, I can...

03:48.279 --> 03:51.547
And Alek spends most of his
day staring out the window.

03:51.549 --> 03:55.550
I'm sorry. Did you say that
Alek "looks out the window"?

03:55.552 --> 03:57.419
Yes.

03:57.421 --> 03:59.155
Just so I'm clear,

03:59.157 --> 04:02.191
do the other kids
not look out the window?

04:02.193 --> 04:04.693
There are things you can do
to help them focus.

04:04.695 --> 04:05.961
There are myriad medications

04:05.963 --> 04:06.895
out there
that will significantly...

04:06.897 --> 04:08.197
Medications?

04:08.199 --> 04:09.698
- Joyce, it's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

04:09.700 --> 04:11.233
I'm sorry. I'm just trying
to pinpoint you.

04:11.235 --> 04:13.735
So, you're telling me that
I need to drug my child

04:13.737 --> 04:15.236
to make your job easier.

04:15.238 --> 04:17.339
These medications
will help them focus,

04:17.341 --> 04:19.778
and it would be easier
for the boys...

04:21.010 --> 04:22.677
If you don't
medicate them now,

04:22.679 --> 04:24.679
they'll just
self-medicate later.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.114
Do you think
this is a good solution?

04:26.116 --> 04:27.919
Throwing pills at a problem?

04:28.952 --> 04:30.321
Then let's go.

04:32.121 --> 04:35.624
You know, boys of single moms,
it's just statistics.

04:35.626 --> 04:36.958
But statistically,

04:36.960 --> 04:39.297
they are more likely
to develop problems.

04:40.498 --> 04:44.398
My God is bigger
than your statistics,

04:44.400 --> 04:46.804
so I don't really care
what you have to say anymore.

04:56.246 --> 04:58.679
<i>I am happy to say that</i>

04:58.681 --> 05:01.650
<i>we will not have to have
another lice check tomorrow.</i>

05:01.652 --> 05:05.587
<i>And the results are in
for our class election.</i>

05:05.589 --> 05:07.155
<i>Our new school president is...</i>

05:07.157 --> 05:09.657
This is it, campaign manager.
The moment of truth.

05:09.659 --> 05:11.393
- <i>Marie Hodge.</i>
- Yes!

05:11.395 --> 05:13.496
<i>Congratulations to everybody
who ran,</i>

05:13.498 --> 05:16.200
<i>and congrats to our new
school president.</i>

05:17.101 --> 05:18.801
Hey, maybe it was a mistake.

05:18.803 --> 05:20.872
It's cool.

05:23.474 --> 05:24.976
Way to go, loser.

05:27.278 --> 05:29.677
Come on, Spencer, you're not
always going to win.

05:29.679 --> 05:31.679
It just doesn't work that way.

05:31.681 --> 05:33.117
You don't get it.

05:33.784 --> 05:35.618
No one gets it.

05:35.620 --> 05:37.451
I tried to fit in here.
I tried.

05:37.453 --> 05:38.989
They wouldn't let me.

05:39.989 --> 05:41.823
You fit in with me.

05:41.825 --> 05:43.893
I get you.

05:43.895 --> 05:45.126
My mom thought it'd be better

05:45.128 --> 05:46.727
switching me
to a Christian school.

05:46.729 --> 05:49.298
Instead,
it's like church, class,

05:49.300 --> 05:52.768
same people everywhere.
All the time.

05:52.770 --> 05:54.169
I just hate it.

05:54.171 --> 05:56.341
Boys, the bell rang,
you should be in class.

05:58.176 --> 06:00.111
A grunt of acknowledgment
would be helpful.

06:01.111 --> 06:02.177
All right,
you're late for class.

06:02.179 --> 06:03.413
Where's your hall pass?

06:04.248 --> 06:05.450
Hall pass.

06:13.390 --> 06:15.225
Here's my hall pass.

06:16.827 --> 06:19.798
Let's go. Principal's office.
Let's go.

06:22.866 --> 06:24.269
Move it.

06:28.638 --> 06:31.373
And like I said, sir,
it'll never happen again.

06:31.375 --> 06:33.411
Tell that wife of yours
I said hello.

06:36.947 --> 06:38.881
What are you guys in for?

06:38.883 --> 06:41.549
Expired hall pass.

06:42.953 --> 06:44.823
Amateurs.

06:45.823 --> 06:48.257
Up. Get up.

06:48.259 --> 06:50.458
Hey, word of advice?
Stay away from that kid.

06:50.460 --> 06:52.727
He is a charmer but he
will get you into trouble

06:52.729 --> 06:54.696
in a heartbeat.

06:54.698 --> 06:58.200
Of course if you're here,
you are already in trouble.

06:58.202 --> 07:01.406
Ah. Why are we dressed
like the A-Team, hmm?

07:02.640 --> 07:05.806
All right,
let's go. Good morning.

07:05.808 --> 07:07.642
Ooh, that's loud.

07:07.644 --> 07:09.510
Bring it in, come on.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.246
All right, if you haven't
already guessed,

07:11.248 --> 07:14.248
today's activity
is basketball.

07:14.251 --> 07:15.751
Hopefully, you've heard of it.

07:15.753 --> 07:18.220
I'm gonna divide you guys up
into two teams today.

07:18.222 --> 07:19.787
Okay? You listening?
Two teams.

07:19.789 --> 07:21.556
All right,
if your last name

07:21.558 --> 07:23.626
begins with A through M,
you're gonna be team one.

07:23.628 --> 07:25.126
You're gonna be over there.

07:25.128 --> 07:28.196
If it begins with N through Z,
you're here. All right?

07:28.198 --> 07:29.599
If you have any questions,
don't ask me.

07:29.601 --> 07:31.366
I promise I'm not gonna
have the answer.

07:31.368 --> 07:32.368
All right, go.

07:32.370 --> 07:33.734
Come on, guys.
Over here.

07:33.736 --> 07:34.938
Yeah, let's go!

07:38.609 --> 07:40.044
Right here.

07:46.116 --> 07:49.585
Hey, isn't that the kid
from the principal's office?

07:49.587 --> 07:51.890
Yeah. Yeah, that's him.

07:56.794 --> 07:58.594
Hey, what's up? I'm Stone.

07:58.596 --> 08:00.029
First name Spencer.

08:00.031 --> 08:02.164
I'm Skarlatos.
First name Alek.

08:02.166 --> 08:04.266
You always introduce
yourselves like that?

08:04.268 --> 08:07.302
No. Just wanted to show you
we we're on the same team.

08:07.304 --> 08:09.938
We're the kids from
Principal Akers' office.

08:09.940 --> 08:11.539
Oh, that's right.

08:11.541 --> 08:13.374
Sorry, I spend
a lot of time there.

08:13.376 --> 08:15.510
Did you ever get
that new hall pass?

08:15.512 --> 08:17.847
Well, I'm Sadler.
First name Anthony.

08:17.849 --> 08:19.248
And if you ever
do need a hall pass,

08:19.251 --> 08:20.414
I can hook you up.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.285
- Cool.
- Oh!

08:22.287 --> 08:24.787
Oops!

08:24.789 --> 08:25.888
What the hell?

08:25.890 --> 08:28.424
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:28.426 --> 08:29.758
Come on, man!

08:29.760 --> 08:31.559
You know that kind of language
isn't allowed in here.

08:31.561 --> 08:32.893
What are you doing?

08:32.895 --> 08:34.196
You're on a warning,
all right?

08:34.198 --> 08:35.931
Are you shitting me?

08:35.933 --> 08:37.465
Okay. All right, walk.

08:37.467 --> 08:38.899
You're going
to the principal's office.

08:38.900 --> 08:40.068
Now. Walk.

08:40.071 --> 08:41.505
Sadler out.

08:43.707 --> 08:44.940
You guys think
that's funny?

08:44.942 --> 08:46.210
You guys wanna walk, too?

08:47.410 --> 08:50.211
Yeah, why not? Why not?
What a fun day.

08:50.213 --> 08:51.979
Hey, who else?
Who else wants to go?

08:51.981 --> 08:53.114
Please, I'm in a mood.

08:53.116 --> 08:54.883
I can do this all day.

08:54.885 --> 08:56.654
All right, let's go.

08:59.324 --> 09:01.491
Oh! Are you guys for real?

09:08.665 --> 09:11.633
I had no idea
you guys could be that cool.

09:11.635 --> 09:13.535
What? We're cool.

09:13.537 --> 09:17.372
- Yeah. We're so cool.
- Huh.

09:17.374 --> 09:20.042
I think your appearance
might imply otherwise.

09:20.044 --> 09:22.480
Now, hold on. Camo's cool.

09:23.914 --> 09:26.415
Wait. Isn't camo cool?

09:26.417 --> 09:29.917
In a word? No.

09:29.919 --> 09:31.256
Sadler!

09:32.088 --> 09:34.323
My office. Right now.

09:34.325 --> 09:35.691
Don't roll your eyes at me.

09:35.693 --> 09:37.492
Didn't I warn you two
about this guy?

09:37.494 --> 09:39.360
Move, move, move, move.
Double time. Double time.

09:39.362 --> 09:41.098
Move, move, move your feet.

09:42.866 --> 09:45.236
Now, you said what?

09:47.105 --> 09:49.106
This is a Christian school!

09:54.611 --> 09:55.744
Anthony!

09:55.746 --> 09:57.448
Stone, my boy.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.348
- Hi!
- Hi.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.785
Oh, wow. That's fun.

10:02.787 --> 10:04.418
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Ms. Eskel.

10:04.420 --> 10:08.590
You too. Aren't you sweet?
You guys have fun.

10:08.592 --> 10:11.295
Anthony, come on.
I wanna show you my room.

10:13.163 --> 10:14.963
Alek and I are gonna play
Airsoft outside.

10:14.965 --> 10:16.434
You wanna pick a gun?

10:18.303 --> 10:20.538
- Whoa.
- M16.

10:23.140 --> 10:24.473
AK.

10:24.475 --> 10:25.643
Jeez.

10:27.343 --> 10:28.612
This here's the paintball gun.

10:31.015 --> 10:33.116
A couple pistols.

10:34.919 --> 10:36.420
Nice.

10:38.154 --> 10:40.721
Now, if you think that's cool,

10:40.723 --> 10:42.225
this is the big gun.

10:44.794 --> 10:45.796
Whoa!

10:49.066 --> 10:50.599
It's for hunting.

10:53.135 --> 10:54.335
You ever seen a real gun?

10:54.337 --> 10:57.138
No. Not a for real one.

10:57.140 --> 10:58.540
You've never been hunting?

10:58.542 --> 11:00.942
No. I mean, black people
don't really hunt.

11:00.944 --> 11:04.079
It's not like a thing we do
in our leisure time.

11:05.781 --> 11:08.683
Come on, let's go
find Alek and play war.

11:08.685 --> 11:12.254
You know what? I've got
an even better idea for war.

11:12.256 --> 11:13.491
Okay.

11:19.797 --> 11:21.297
Hello?

11:21.299 --> 11:23.699
Hi, Alice, how...

11:23.701 --> 11:25.901
Oh, well, it was probably just
some neighborhood kids.

11:25.903 --> 11:28.372
Do you want me to send
Spencer over to help you...

11:31.241 --> 11:33.211
You've gotta be kidding me.

11:40.285 --> 11:42.183
Jeez, Mom,
have you heard of knocking?

11:42.185 --> 11:43.417
This is my house.

11:43.419 --> 11:44.786
I don't need
your permission to enter.

11:44.788 --> 11:46.088
Okay, I'm sorry.

11:46.090 --> 11:47.622
I just hung up the phone
with Alice,

11:47.624 --> 11:49.391
and she told me
that a skinny black kid

11:49.393 --> 11:50.691
and a pasty white kid

11:50.693 --> 11:52.762
just decorated her house
with toilet paper.

11:57.701 --> 11:59.334
I'm sorry.

11:59.336 --> 12:01.035
I didn't think
she could see us.

12:01.037 --> 12:02.671
So that makes it okay?

12:02.673 --> 12:04.038
You can do what you want as
long as you don't get caught?

12:04.040 --> 12:05.440
No, Mom.
I didn't mean it that way.

12:05.442 --> 12:07.942
I am mortified, Spencer.
Mortified!

12:07.944 --> 12:09.777
What am I gonna tell
Anthony's father?

12:09.779 --> 12:11.280
I don't think
you should tell...

12:11.282 --> 12:12.947
No, you don't think.
The constant calls

12:12.949 --> 12:14.516
from the principal, all the
trouble you've been causing,

12:14.518 --> 12:17.118
it's too much.
It's too much, Spencer.

12:17.120 --> 12:18.652
Mom, I'm sorry.

12:18.654 --> 12:20.088
And it is getting harder
and harder to come in here,

12:20.090 --> 12:22.423
because every time I do,
I just leave disappointed.

12:22.425 --> 12:23.727
- Mom...
- Go to bed.

12:35.838 --> 12:36.906
Lord,

12:36.908 --> 12:39.508
make me an instrument
of Your peace.

12:39.510 --> 12:42.411
Where there is hatred,
let me sow love.

12:42.413 --> 12:45.047
Where there is injury, pardon.

12:45.049 --> 12:47.349
Where there is darkness,
light.

12:47.351 --> 12:51.355
And where there is sadness,
joy.

12:52.490 --> 12:55.690
For it is in giving
that we receive.

12:55.692 --> 12:58.994
It is in pardoning
that we are pardoned.

12:58.996 --> 13:03.165
And it is in dying that we
are born into eternal life.

13:03.167 --> 13:04.569
Amen.

13:26.990 --> 13:28.359
<i>Spencer, go!</i>

13:29.760 --> 13:31.893
FDR.

13:31.895 --> 13:34.363
A man who did the right things
at the right times

13:34.365 --> 13:40.035
to defuse dangerous situations
at extremely critical moments.

13:40.037 --> 13:41.936
So if something were to happen
right now...

13:43.106 --> 13:44.973
Mmm-hmm.

13:44.975 --> 13:46.941
Would you know what to do?

13:46.943 --> 13:48.645
Would you know how to act?

13:49.379 --> 13:50.880
Would you act?

13:54.285 --> 13:57.686
All right. Don't forget.
Test tomorrow.

13:57.688 --> 14:00.455
And read the book.
Do not say I didn't warn you.

14:00.457 --> 14:02.137
I'm talking to you, you
and especially you.

14:03.526 --> 14:04.825
Thanks, teach.

14:04.827 --> 14:07.461
- Glad you boys enjoyed.
- We always do.

14:07.463 --> 14:08.729
Were you ever able to find any

14:08.731 --> 14:10.431
battle plans
from World War II?

14:10.433 --> 14:12.633
Ah, you know what?

14:12.635 --> 14:13.935
Printed these out last night.

14:13.937 --> 14:16.238
That should hold you over
until tomorrow.

14:16.240 --> 14:18.572
Oh, my gosh.
Dude, check that out!

14:18.574 --> 14:19.807
- Oh, yeah.
- This is awesome.

14:19.809 --> 14:22.444
- Thank you so much.
- Dude, thank you.

14:24.014 --> 14:25.814
Those boys.

14:25.816 --> 14:28.351
Attack! Attack! Attack!

14:33.823 --> 14:35.859
Oh, crap.

14:42.198 --> 14:44.199
There's something
about war, man.

14:44.201 --> 14:46.734
The brotherhood, the history.

14:46.736 --> 14:48.237
In the trenches helping out.

14:48.239 --> 14:49.573
Like your grandpa, I guess.

14:53.143 --> 14:54.845
I wanna go to the prom.

14:55.511 --> 14:58.146
You mean, like, with us?

14:58.148 --> 15:00.648
No, man.
I mean, just in general.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.318
We don't have it
at our school.

15:02.320 --> 15:05.555
There's no prom here,
or homecoming.

15:06.324 --> 15:07.489
I don't know.

15:07.491 --> 15:09.324
No public school stuff.

15:09.326 --> 15:11.259
Exactly.

15:11.261 --> 15:13.029
So, are you gonna leave?

15:14.130 --> 15:15.533
Yeah.

15:16.800 --> 15:19.099
I mean, you guys are great,

15:19.101 --> 15:20.902
but I need a girlfriend.

15:22.438 --> 15:24.705
Well, we'll miss you, man.

15:24.707 --> 15:27.042
Hey, I'll keep in touch.

15:27.044 --> 15:28.509
I mean, someone's gotta
let you guys know

15:28.511 --> 15:29.979
what it's like
to have a girlfriend.

15:42.092 --> 15:43.394
Hey!

15:50.568 --> 15:51.966
Maybe Anthony's right.

15:51.968 --> 15:54.469
We should leave, too.
It sucks without him.

15:54.471 --> 15:55.903
We don't have a choice.

15:55.905 --> 15:58.873
We were lucky
to leave our last school.

15:58.875 --> 16:01.976
Look, it sucks. But if we keep
our heads down, we'll be fine.

16:01.978 --> 16:04.446
You've got to be kidding me.

16:04.448 --> 16:05.913
We gotta go,
we're gonna be late.

16:05.915 --> 16:08.148
We can't just spend
our lives in fear.

16:08.150 --> 16:10.121
Guys, class. Now.

16:11.489 --> 16:13.354
Class is right there.
We're on time.

16:13.356 --> 16:15.123
We're talking back today?

16:15.125 --> 16:17.259
But you're not in class,
are you, huh?

16:17.261 --> 16:20.928
And I suppose either of you
don't have hall passes.

16:20.930 --> 16:23.500
The two of you
need an escort? Move!

16:24.101 --> 16:26.070
Move!

16:27.538 --> 16:29.838
<i>No, they're not
problem children.</i>

16:29.840 --> 16:31.739
I don't understand
where this is coming from.

16:31.741 --> 16:33.108
Did anyone get hurt?

16:33.110 --> 16:36.009
No. No, Ms. Eskel,
no one has gotten hurt.

16:36.011 --> 16:38.846
Yet. But I wouldn't
put it past them.

16:38.848 --> 16:42.183
Is this a joke? You think our
boys would hurt someone?

16:42.185 --> 16:44.187
Ms. Skarlatos,

16:45.789 --> 16:47.623
we know this is difficult,

16:47.625 --> 16:50.792
but we think it would be
in your son's best interests

16:50.794 --> 16:53.463
if he stayed with his father.

16:54.463 --> 16:56.598
How dare you!

16:56.600 --> 16:58.733
After all I do
for this school!

16:58.735 --> 17:01.069
Coaching and volunteering.

17:01.071 --> 17:02.571
You have no business.

17:02.573 --> 17:04.339
No business!

17:04.340 --> 17:05.839
We have consulted
with the Lord.

17:07.243 --> 17:11.378
You have no right.
No right butting in our lives!

17:11.381 --> 17:13.217
The absurdity of it all.

17:16.117 --> 17:17.919
Jesus.

17:17.921 --> 17:20.924
Come on, sweetie. Come on.

17:26.229 --> 17:27.964
Come on, Spencer.

17:49.885 --> 17:51.888
- Okay.
- Wait!

18:02.799 --> 18:05.935
This isn't goodbye.
Just a see you later.

18:13.609 --> 18:15.375
It's okay.

18:15.377 --> 18:16.880
Ready?

18:17.315 --> 18:18.816
Let's go.

18:54.049 --> 18:55.685
Spencer.

18:58.120 --> 19:01.155
I know this is gonna
be hard on you,

19:01.157 --> 19:03.325
but it's a really
short flight to Oregon,

19:03.327 --> 19:06.227
and you can go visit him
whenever you want.

19:06.229 --> 19:08.132
I promise.

19:08.933 --> 19:10.332
Okay?

19:10.334 --> 19:11.602
Okay.

19:15.138 --> 19:16.639
Okay.

19:37.728 --> 19:39.094
What do you keep
looking at?

19:39.096 --> 19:41.965
That guy's been in there
for, like, 10 minutes.

19:42.933 --> 19:44.431
Ten minutes. Really?

19:44.433 --> 19:47.201
Yeah. Yeah. I saw him go
in there with a suitcase.

19:47.203 --> 19:48.135
A suitcase?

19:48.137 --> 19:49.871
I don't know what he's doing.

19:49.873 --> 19:51.940
Maybe he's changing
his clothes.

19:51.942 --> 19:54.642
Maybe so.
I'm gonna go check it out.

19:54.644 --> 19:56.314
- All right?
- Okay.

20:02.417 --> 20:04.853
Man, that guy's
been in there for a while.

20:04.855 --> 20:06.924
Yeah, I noticed.

20:19.035 --> 20:21.038
Get out of here, it's serious.

20:28.511 --> 20:29.812
I've got the gun.

20:35.018 --> 20:37.184
So data analysis is really
where it all begins.

20:37.186 --> 20:40.988
It's the basis for
any job you might have.

20:40.990 --> 20:44.892
Even if you wanted
to work in, say,

20:44.894 --> 20:46.661
middle management at Nike,

20:46.663 --> 20:48.363
you'd have to have
some semblance

20:48.365 --> 20:49.764
of knowledge of numbers

20:49.766 --> 20:52.300
in order to gauge sales.

20:52.302 --> 20:55.702
Mr. Skarlatos.

20:55.704 --> 20:57.037
What about you?

20:57.039 --> 20:59.173
What kind of work
are you interested in?

20:59.175 --> 21:00.308
Uh...

21:00.310 --> 21:01.910
I've always wanted
to join the military.

21:01.912 --> 21:03.577
Okay, now, see,

21:03.579 --> 21:06.713
even as it pertains to the
military, you'll need numbers.

21:06.715 --> 21:10.384
Statistics, analysis,
troop movements,

21:10.386 --> 21:11.919
supply chain logistics.

21:11.921 --> 21:14.154
Any kind of real-world job

21:14.156 --> 21:16.223
that any of you
might wanna have

21:16.225 --> 21:19.195
is going to include numbers.
You're gonna need...

21:24.568 --> 21:28.703
Hey, Stone, who are we
throwing daggers at?

21:28.705 --> 21:30.505
Not throwing daggers.
Just thinking.

21:30.507 --> 21:32.239
Don't hurt yourself.

21:32.241 --> 21:34.408
Hey, that recruitment center
over there, uh,

21:34.410 --> 21:35.844
what's all that about?

21:35.846 --> 21:38.612
It's where people go
and sign up for the service.

21:38.614 --> 21:39.747
What part of the service?

21:39.749 --> 21:41.716
All of them. I think.

21:41.718 --> 21:43.218
I don't think
they discriminate.

21:44.289 --> 21:45.920
Hey, sir.
How are you doing?

21:45.922 --> 21:47.422
Welcome to Jamba Juice.
What can I get for ya?

21:47.424 --> 21:49.123
Uh, you know,
can I just get a smoothie

21:49.125 --> 21:50.357
with strawberry and banana,
please? Nothing else.

21:50.359 --> 21:53.295
- Yeah, no problem. One second.
- Thanks.

21:53.297 --> 21:54.761
So if you don't
mind me asking,

21:54.763 --> 21:56.030
what part of the service
are you with?

21:56.032 --> 21:57.931
Oh, this here is
a Marine's uniform.

21:57.933 --> 22:01.137
Oh, yeah, right.
Just double-checking.

22:02.204 --> 22:03.805
So, if you could
do it all over again,

22:03.807 --> 22:04.940
which would you choose?

22:04.942 --> 22:06.473
- Which what?
- Which branch?

22:06.475 --> 22:08.108
I mean, would you still go
with the Marines?

22:08.110 --> 22:09.576
Or was there something else?

22:09.578 --> 22:12.547
Oh, I can't say I ever thought
about that before.

22:12.549 --> 22:14.516
So, you'd still go
with the Marines, then?

22:14.518 --> 22:16.317
Well, that's hard to say, too.

22:16.319 --> 22:18.018
I love what I do,
but I always wanted

22:18.020 --> 22:20.054
to be part of
the Air Force Pararescue.

22:20.056 --> 22:22.324
And their sole purpose
is saving people's lives.

22:22.326 --> 22:23.827
Pretty badass.

22:25.796 --> 22:27.431
Yeah. Yeah, that is badass.

22:28.798 --> 22:30.298
Can you imagine
putting your hands

22:30.300 --> 22:32.534
on a man in his most
frightening moment?

22:32.536 --> 22:34.669
And drawing him back to life?

22:34.671 --> 22:36.770
Yeah. Yeah, I can.

22:36.772 --> 22:37.904
Well, here you go.

22:37.906 --> 22:39.406
Thanks. How much?

22:39.408 --> 22:41.910
On the house.
Thanks for your service.

22:41.912 --> 22:43.280
Happy to do it.

22:43.779 --> 22:45.211
Thank you.

22:45.213 --> 22:47.114
Appreciate that. You have
a good rest of your day.

22:47.116 --> 22:48.351
You too.

22:50.186 --> 22:52.386
Wow. With that tip he left you,

22:52.388 --> 22:54.155
you're just about
able to cover

22:54.157 --> 22:56.790
the smoothie
you now get to pay for.

22:56.792 --> 22:58.227
Totally worth it.

23:05.602 --> 23:06.968
They're analyzing

23:06.970 --> 23:08.368
statistics of populations,

23:08.370 --> 23:10.904
they're analyzing
intelligence scores.

23:10.906 --> 23:13.007
There's all kinds
of applications

23:13.009 --> 23:14.675
for data analysis.

23:14.677 --> 23:16.912
This is a big first down.
They need this right here.

23:16.914 --> 23:18.613
I know. They better
give it to Marshawn, man.

23:18.615 --> 23:19.814
He's like their best player.

23:19.816 --> 23:21.348
He's been having
a monster game, too.

23:21.350 --> 23:24.117
I know. He's a beast, man.

23:24.119 --> 23:25.185
<i>Chambers was saying</i>

23:25.187 --> 23:26.420
<i>we play a lot of players.</i>

23:26.422 --> 23:28.021
- Come on, baby.
- There you go.

23:28.023 --> 23:29.156
Break that.
There you go.

23:29.158 --> 23:30.357
Keep going, keep going.

23:30.359 --> 23:32.027
- There you go.
- Oh! Run!

23:32.029 --> 23:33.428
- Boom. There you go, baby.
- And he ran them over.

23:33.430 --> 23:36.131
That was a good play.

23:36.133 --> 23:38.132
<i>And he's got
a first down for California.</i>

23:38.134 --> 23:39.700
- <i>At the 31.</i>
- Wow.

23:39.702 --> 23:41.602
Only a full day later.

23:41.604 --> 23:42.737
What happened?

23:42.739 --> 23:44.238
Alek, man.

23:44.240 --> 23:46.141
I texted him some big news,
like, eight hours ago,

23:46.143 --> 23:47.208
and he's just
getting back to me

23:47.210 --> 23:48.642
with this lukewarm response.

23:48.644 --> 23:50.177
What was the big news?

23:50.179 --> 23:51.711
Oh, I'm gonna try out
for the Air Force Pararescue.

23:51.713 --> 23:56.049
Oh. Man, that's, uh...
That's great. For real?

23:56.051 --> 23:58.752
You're gonna join
the Air Force now, huh?

23:58.754 --> 24:00.954
Okay.
So what's that about?

24:00.956 --> 24:02.623
What's what about?

24:02.625 --> 24:06.727
How come no one's hearing this
as life-changing information?

24:06.729 --> 24:09.499
I don't know, man. Maybe...
Maybe 'cause it's you.

24:10.599 --> 24:12.300
What does that even mean?

24:12.302 --> 24:14.768
I mean, not to say anything
against you or anything,

24:14.770 --> 24:16.104
but you kind of
got to be in shape

24:16.106 --> 24:17.639
to be in the military,
you know?

24:17.641 --> 24:20.740
Come on. So I gotta lose
some weight. So what?

24:20.742 --> 24:22.910
I mean, it's not just that.
What about your motivation?

24:22.912 --> 24:25.078
You quit football
to play basketball.

24:25.080 --> 24:26.547
Then you quit basketball

24:26.549 --> 24:28.348
because you weren't getting
enough playing time.

24:28.350 --> 24:31.618
Okay. So you don't think
I can do it, then?

24:33.022 --> 24:35.289
Spencer, man,
no one thinks you can't do it.

24:35.291 --> 24:36.993
We just don't think you will.

24:38.296 --> 24:39.596
Okay.

24:43.866 --> 24:46.400
Guess we'll see about that.

24:46.402 --> 24:49.439
<i>Forsett was a yard short
of 1,000 yards...</i>

24:57.780 --> 24:59.779
<i>Once you begin
to discover who you are,</i>

24:59.781 --> 25:01.282
<i>then you really realize</i>

25:01.284 --> 25:04.288
<i>how you have been given
authority over your life.</i>

25:06.956 --> 25:10.459
<i>But you can only do that
through the struggle of life.</i>

25:13.029 --> 25:14.964
<i>And most people
avoid the struggle.</i>

25:17.366 --> 25:19.936
<i>Most people go through life
avoiding pain.</i>

25:22.638 --> 25:24.070
<i>When you're working
on a dream,</i>

25:24.072 --> 25:25.339
<i>at some point in time</i>

25:25.341 --> 25:27.677
<i>a transition takes place.</i>

25:30.379 --> 25:33.914
<i>Something in you
that you never activated</i>

25:33.916 --> 25:36.253
<i>lies dormant in there.</i>

25:39.155 --> 25:41.354
<i>You learn how to leap higher.</i>

25:41.356 --> 25:45.393
<i>You start challenging yourself
to dig deeper.</i>

25:45.395 --> 25:49.898
<i>You don't need anybody
to approve your dream.</i>

25:49.900 --> 25:52.366
<i>Do what you know is right.</i>

25:52.368 --> 25:55.137
<i>Don't try and take
any shortcuts.</i>

25:55.806 --> 25:58.105
<i>Pay your dues.</i>

25:58.107 --> 26:01.077
<i>We've been chosen
for this great work.</i>

26:09.019 --> 26:10.285
Let's go!

26:10.287 --> 26:12.323
Is that all you got? Let's go!

26:16.158 --> 26:18.361
Nine minutes,
14 seconds.

26:19.095 --> 26:20.662
Damn, Stone...

26:20.664 --> 26:22.863
I didn't know a big guy
like you could run that fast.

26:22.865 --> 26:24.132
Thank you, sir.

26:26.235 --> 26:27.634
Ninety-six.

26:27.636 --> 26:29.871
You did it.
You passed. Congratulations.

26:29.873 --> 26:31.706
Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.

26:31.708 --> 26:33.143
Whoo!

26:35.878 --> 26:37.278
All right, that's very good.

26:37.280 --> 26:38.680
All right, now,
just step over here.

26:38.682 --> 26:40.049
Okay.

26:42.818 --> 26:44.354
Head against the bar.

26:46.455 --> 26:48.721
And which circle is different?

26:48.723 --> 26:50.159
Uh, let me see.

26:51.126 --> 26:52.762
Is this a trick question?

26:57.067 --> 26:58.266
Um...

26:58.268 --> 27:01.305
Number three is different.

27:03.973 --> 27:05.375
Stone.

27:08.279 --> 27:09.544
Here is a list
of specialty codes

27:09.546 --> 27:11.011
that you have qualified for.

27:11.013 --> 27:14.047
Please review the list
and choose your top three.

27:14.049 --> 27:16.219
- Turner?
- Sir.

27:18.521 --> 27:19.620
Hey, sir, sorry.

27:19.622 --> 27:21.456
The, uh, the job I wanted
is not on here.

27:21.458 --> 27:22.692
I don't see Pararescue.

27:25.461 --> 27:27.662
Looks like you didn't qualify.

27:27.664 --> 27:29.396
What do you mean,
I didn't qualify?

27:29.398 --> 27:33.066
I passed the stamina test,
I got a good ASVAB score.

27:33.068 --> 27:35.504
The doctors didn't say
anything was wrong with me.

27:39.642 --> 27:41.241
Looks like
you were disqualified

27:41.243 --> 27:42.977
for lack of depth perception.

27:42.979 --> 27:44.178
What?

27:44.180 --> 27:45.479
You don't have
depth perception.

27:45.481 --> 27:46.914
You can't be a PJ without it.

27:46.916 --> 27:48.583
Are you serious?

27:48.585 --> 27:50.652
Choose three jobs from the
list in order of preference.

27:50.654 --> 27:52.853
Pick quickly or you might
not get anything.

27:52.855 --> 27:55.292
We're only open
for another 30 minutes.

27:56.058 --> 27:57.924
Turner.

27:57.926 --> 27:59.626
Here's a list of jobs
that you have qualified for.

27:59.628 --> 28:02.331
Please review the list
and choose your top three.

28:06.434 --> 28:08.335
<i>A year I punish
myself and for what?</i>

28:08.337 --> 28:11.272
Because of depth perception?
You gotta be kidding me.

28:11.274 --> 28:13.239
Okay. Is there something
that you can do?

28:13.241 --> 28:14.374
Someone we can appeal to?

28:14.376 --> 28:15.643
Maybe we can write a letter.

28:15.645 --> 28:17.280
No. It's not something
you can appeal.

28:19.347 --> 28:22.415
Okay, okay.
Honey, here, sit down.

28:22.417 --> 28:24.786
Honey, it's gonna be okay.
It'll be okay.

28:24.788 --> 28:26.688
No, it's not gonna be okay.
That's the thing.

28:26.690 --> 28:28.922
Why did I even work so hard
in the first place?

28:28.924 --> 28:31.325
Baby, listen, it's you, okay?

28:31.327 --> 28:33.059
When you were a kid,
if you heard the word

28:33.061 --> 28:34.862
"war" on the television,

28:34.864 --> 28:36.064
you would practically jump

28:36.066 --> 28:37.332
inside the TV screen
to get involved.

28:37.334 --> 28:39.366
Exactly.
I just wanted to help.

28:39.368 --> 28:42.135
I don't get why they won't
just let me go do it.

28:42.137 --> 28:43.971
You know, I haven't really
accomplished much with my life.

28:43.973 --> 28:45.206
At least before I could say

28:45.208 --> 28:46.207
it's because
I hadn't really tried.

28:46.209 --> 28:48.209
Now I can't even say that.

28:48.211 --> 28:50.380
I tried and I failed.
This is worse.

28:56.253 --> 28:58.118
<i>...to McLemore. Wow!</i>

28:58.120 --> 28:59.820
<i>He still finishes!</i>

29:02.525 --> 29:04.091
<i>Saw that one coming.</i>

29:04.093 --> 29:07.564
<i>That's the second alley-oop
he's converted on.</i>

29:09.299 --> 29:10.463
Hey, what's going on, man?

29:10.465 --> 29:11.833
- What's up, man?
- Glad you made it.

29:11.835 --> 29:13.800
- How you doing?
- Good. Just watching the game.

29:13.802 --> 29:15.169
Come on in.

29:15.171 --> 29:16.504
Man, I hope San Jose State

29:16.506 --> 29:18.306
upsets Kansas, too.
We need this.

29:18.308 --> 29:20.208
Oh, yep, yep, yep.

29:20.210 --> 29:22.375
Saw this guy
dunk on this fool earlier.

29:22.377 --> 29:24.210
Reminded me when I dunked
on your ass.

29:24.212 --> 29:26.180
Ah, you ain't never
dunked on me.

29:26.182 --> 29:27.346
You want a beer?

29:27.348 --> 29:29.317
Actually, yeah.

29:29.319 --> 29:31.518
I had to come see you before you
dipped out of here, you know.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.019
You must be nervous, right?

29:33.021 --> 29:35.456
Ah, it's all good. I'm just
going to Texas for basic.

29:35.458 --> 29:36.757
Yeah, but not a lot of people

29:36.759 --> 29:38.858
make it this far
in the process, you know.

29:38.860 --> 29:39.929
That's a commitment.

29:40.895 --> 29:42.632
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

29:45.468 --> 29:46.967
So you're about to get up
out of here, man.

29:46.969 --> 29:48.335
You excited or what?

29:48.337 --> 29:50.004
Yeah, but...

29:50.006 --> 29:51.275
I don't know, man.

29:52.575 --> 29:55.875
Remember when I brought
this up a long time ago?

29:55.877 --> 29:56.877
How could I forget?

29:56.879 --> 29:58.746
You were about
30 pounds heavier

29:58.748 --> 30:00.413
and nobody thought
you would get here.

30:00.415 --> 30:02.048
Yeah, man.

30:02.050 --> 30:04.852
Well, it ended up being that
you were right.

30:04.854 --> 30:06.253
Right about what?

30:06.255 --> 30:07.654
Well, I went to MEPS

30:07.656 --> 30:09.056
and I got disqualified
for depth perception,

30:09.058 --> 30:11.459
so I can't even go be a PJ.

30:11.461 --> 30:12.692
You know,
I don't really know, like,

30:12.694 --> 30:14.161
the ins and outs
of the military stuff.

30:14.163 --> 30:15.729
What do you mean?

30:15.731 --> 30:19.270
Basically, I had to end up
signing up for SERE instead.

30:20.403 --> 30:22.102
What's that?

30:22.104 --> 30:24.505
It stands for Survival,
Evasion, Resistance and Escape.

30:24.507 --> 30:26.406
It's not really
the same thing at all.

30:26.408 --> 30:28.541
Well, I mean, even if
it's not the same thing,

30:28.543 --> 30:30.978
I'm sure it'll still be
meaningful, you know.

30:30.980 --> 30:35.149
Yeah. But I'm just not
passionate about it, you know?

30:35.151 --> 30:37.918
I just wanted to go to war
and I wanted to save lives.

30:37.920 --> 30:39.819
Well, I'm sure whatever job
they put you in,

30:39.821 --> 30:41.289
you'll still be able
to help others.

30:41.291 --> 30:42.692
It's who you've always been.

30:43.760 --> 30:46.663
Yeah, yeah, I guess so, man.

30:54.970 --> 30:57.707
- What's going on?
- Hey, man, what's happening?

31:01.777 --> 31:04.311
What the hell is that?
A sewing project?

31:04.313 --> 31:05.746
Yeah.

31:05.748 --> 31:07.815
Great! So I guess we have
that to look forward to.

31:07.817 --> 31:09.450
What function
does that even serve?

31:09.452 --> 31:11.752
Survival. If you eject
from an aircraft,

31:11.754 --> 31:13.320
all you'll have is a parachute,

31:13.322 --> 31:15.556
few other tools, you know,

31:15.558 --> 31:17.056
anything else
you can scrounge up to make

31:17.058 --> 31:20.560
a hammock, tent, trip wires,
weapons to hunt with.

31:20.562 --> 31:23.364
Cool. So I guess
home ec will help us survive.

31:23.366 --> 31:26.268
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Pretty much.

31:26.270 --> 31:28.068
Spencer, man, take a break.

31:28.070 --> 31:29.670
I can't, man. I'm already
pretty behind

31:29.672 --> 31:31.505
on all my assignments.
I'm about to fail out.

31:31.507 --> 31:33.472
Well, here, look.
Let me show you something.

31:33.474 --> 31:35.276
Check this out.

31:35.278 --> 31:36.510
- Ta-da!
- What is that?

31:36.512 --> 31:37.944
It's for sewing.

31:37.946 --> 31:39.314
So you can pound
needles through

31:39.316 --> 31:40.780
without your hands going raw.

31:40.782 --> 31:43.450
Okay. All right.
I see what you're doing.

31:43.452 --> 31:46.487
Now your hands
will stay baby soft.

31:46.489 --> 31:47.688
Dude, this is literally
the only way

31:47.690 --> 31:48.922
I'm gonna even finish in time.

31:48.924 --> 31:50.524
Oh, don't worry,
with baby soft hands,

31:50.526 --> 31:51.760
you'll always finish fast.

31:54.163 --> 31:55.930
You guys
are something else, man.

31:55.932 --> 32:00.269
Left face! In line.

32:00.271 --> 32:02.605
- Who are we?
- Air Force!

32:07.310 --> 32:09.009
Oh, shit!

32:09.011 --> 32:10.579
No! No! No!

32:17.653 --> 32:19.353
<i>♪ We are the Air Force!</i>

32:19.355 --> 32:22.257

32:41.109 --> 32:43.443
Airman Stone,
how nice of you to join us.

32:43.445 --> 32:45.147
Drop. On the podium.

32:50.752 --> 32:52.586
Airman Stone,
why are you doing push-ups?

32:52.588 --> 32:53.820
I'm late, Sergeant.

32:53.822 --> 32:57.156
Yes, you were late.
Why are you late?

32:57.158 --> 32:58.659
I overslept, Sergeant.

32:58.661 --> 33:00.059
He overslept.

33:00.061 --> 33:02.062
Ladies and gentlemen,
let this be an example

33:02.064 --> 33:04.097
to you of what not to do.

33:04.099 --> 33:06.300
SERE. SERE.

33:06.302 --> 33:08.170
1401.

33:09.472 --> 33:10.839
Recover.

33:13.408 --> 33:14.642
Carry on.

33:14.644 --> 33:16.045
SERE.

33:23.117 --> 33:24.587
Well done.

33:33.596 --> 33:36.229
Airman Stone, do you look
like everyone else?

33:36.231 --> 33:37.631
No, Sergeant.

33:37.633 --> 33:40.202
No, you do not. Drop.

33:43.807 --> 33:45.239
Airman Stone,
you're doing push-ups

33:45.241 --> 33:48.075
because you cannot follow
simple directions.

33:53.283 --> 33:55.217
SERE. SERE.

33:56.019 --> 33:57.787
1401.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.222
Recover.

34:02.191 --> 34:03.923
- Carry on.
- SERE.

34:03.925 --> 34:05.858
Airman Stone, your stitches
are not tight enough.

34:05.860 --> 34:07.393
I'll do them over again,
Sergeant.

34:07.395 --> 34:09.063
Airman Stone, I have no
choice. This is not a game.

34:09.065 --> 34:10.264
This is survival.

34:10.266 --> 34:11.398
There are no do-overs.
Do you understand me?

34:11.400 --> 34:12.533
Yes, Sergeant.

34:12.534 --> 34:13.867
Report to the MTLs

34:13.869 --> 34:15.630
and you'll be served
your elimination papers.

34:28.384 --> 34:29.686
Okay.

34:31.154 --> 34:32.286
Here we go.

34:32.289 --> 34:33.655
All right.

34:42.565 --> 34:43.764
I knew
you shouldn't have driven

34:43.766 --> 34:44.965
all the way here
just to say goodbye.

34:44.967 --> 34:47.168
Well, I was worried
about you, Alek.

34:47.170 --> 34:49.702
I've had this
profound sense of fear

34:49.704 --> 34:51.371
about you going to war.

34:51.373 --> 34:52.672
Well, you're a mom.

34:52.675 --> 34:54.041
You're supposed
to worry about your kids.

34:54.043 --> 34:57.210
But listen, sweetie.
I prayed about it.

34:57.212 --> 35:00.281
And God spoke to me
and He told me that

35:00.283 --> 35:04.351
something very exciting
is going to happen.

35:04.353 --> 35:06.086
And...

35:06.088 --> 35:09.726
I can't wait to see
what He has in store for you.

35:10.826 --> 35:12.761
I'm gonna be fine.

35:13.762 --> 35:15.063
Love you, Mom.

35:46.596 --> 35:49.028
What's going on? Somebody please!
What's happening?

35:49.030 --> 35:51.498
There's a guy with a gun.
Just run.

35:51.500 --> 35:52.833
Come on, Dad, we gotta go.

35:52.835 --> 35:54.301
No, you go, my darling.
You go.

35:54.303 --> 35:56.172
I'll follow. I'll follow.

36:21.730 --> 36:24.597
Oh, cool. We're gonna be
glorified cattle.

36:24.599 --> 36:27.434
That's what we get
for not cutting it at Lackland.

36:27.436 --> 36:29.436
Daycare for adults.

36:29.438 --> 36:32.005
What does that mean?

36:32.007 --> 36:34.374
Just what I heard.
Instead of teaching fighting

36:34.376 --> 36:35.876
they teach you how to

36:35.878 --> 36:37.610
"mitigate the room
vulnerabilities"

36:37.612 --> 36:40.847
by, like, running and hiding.

36:40.849 --> 36:42.382
Thought we were
in the military?

36:42.384 --> 36:43.983
That's hard.

36:43.985 --> 36:45.585
<i>♪ They've come
to get the wounded...</i>

36:45.587 --> 36:47.054
<i>♪ They've come
to get the wounded...</i>

36:47.056 --> 36:49.088
<i>♪ They've come
to get the dead...</i>

36:49.090 --> 36:51.260
<i>♪ They've come
to get the dead... ♪</i>

36:55.931 --> 36:57.130
All right,
so once you've inflated

36:57.132 --> 36:58.664
the bladder
to the desired pressure,

36:58.666 --> 37:00.733
in this case,
140 mmHg or higher,

37:00.735 --> 37:02.068
you're gonna listen
to make sure

37:02.070 --> 37:04.371
you cannot hear the pulse
below the bladder.

37:04.373 --> 37:05.639
That's critical.

37:05.641 --> 37:07.606
Are there any questions
on this section?

37:07.608 --> 37:09.476
No?

37:09.478 --> 37:11.744
Okay, let's move on.
Let's go to the next chapter.

37:13.283 --> 37:15.316
<i>There is
an active shooter on base.</i>

37:15.318 --> 37:17.784
<i>Shelter in place until you
receive further instructions.</i>

37:17.786 --> 37:19.119
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

37:19.121 --> 37:20.420
Okay, there is
an active shooter on base.

37:20.422 --> 37:21.487
You guys, move this desk
over to the door.

37:21.489 --> 37:22.789
Make sure it can't open.

37:22.791 --> 37:24.124
Everybody else,
get under your desks.

37:24.126 --> 37:26.059
This is not a drill! Move!

37:26.061 --> 37:29.228
This is not an exercise!
Get under your desks now.

37:31.067 --> 37:32.833
Okay, remember the protocol.

37:32.835 --> 37:34.066
If you escape,

37:34.068 --> 37:35.704
you do not engage.
Protect yourselves.

37:38.739 --> 37:40.340
- All right.
- We're so screwed.

37:40.342 --> 37:42.045
It's all I got, man.

37:45.281 --> 37:46.246
Stone!

37:46.248 --> 37:48.548
Stone, get under
your desk, now.

37:48.550 --> 37:49.949
God damn it. Stone!

37:49.951 --> 37:51.751
What the hell are you doing?

37:51.753 --> 37:54.019
None of you move.

37:55.325 --> 37:57.693
Francis, get back
under your desk!

37:59.261 --> 38:00.793
Stone, what the hell
are you doing?

38:00.795 --> 38:01.961
Get under your desk.

38:20.349 --> 38:22.115
We're clear!

38:22.117 --> 38:24.083
Okay, that's the all-clear.

38:24.085 --> 38:25.851
Stone, you wanna move
this desk back for me?

38:25.853 --> 38:27.924
Somebody help him, please.

38:38.833 --> 38:41.369
God damn it!

38:48.009 --> 38:49.777
Guys, this was a false alarm.

38:49.779 --> 38:50.978
Just wanted to let you know

38:50.980 --> 38:52.411
that everything
is completely fine,

38:52.413 --> 38:54.581
- and that we're all safe.
- What happened?

38:54.583 --> 38:57.285
An active shooter alert
went out over our PA system,

38:57.287 --> 39:00.153
but the actual location
wasn't attached.

39:00.155 --> 39:03.226
It was nearby,
but not our base.

39:04.826 --> 39:06.559
Carry on.

39:06.561 --> 39:08.561
Everybody settle.

39:08.563 --> 39:09.896
Jesus Christ...

39:09.898 --> 39:11.164
Stone, what the hell
were you going to do

39:11.166 --> 39:12.499
with a ball point pen
anyways, huh?

39:12.501 --> 39:14.034
I don't know, ma'am.

39:14.036 --> 39:15.303
I just didn't want
my family to find out

39:15.305 --> 39:16.103
that I'd died
hiding underneath a desk.

39:16.105 --> 39:17.470
Hmm.

39:17.472 --> 39:18.672
Huh.

39:18.674 --> 39:21.177
Show of hands.
Who thinks Stone's an asshole?

39:22.076 --> 39:23.443
Come on, man.

39:23.445 --> 39:25.085
Yeah, me too.
That's gonna be on the test.

39:53.007 --> 39:55.407
Strange.
No beggars on our tail.

39:55.409 --> 39:57.012
Guess they're not
following today.

39:58.346 --> 40:00.547
Check the DAGR
and confirm our coordinates.

40:00.549 --> 40:02.083
Roger.

40:06.788 --> 40:08.957
Skarlatos, come on, man.

40:09.925 --> 40:10.990
Shit!

40:10.992 --> 40:12.458
I can't find my rucksack.

40:12.460 --> 40:13.994
Did you have it
at the last stop?

40:13.996 --> 40:15.463
Yeah.

40:16.532 --> 40:18.367
Security halt.

40:23.771 --> 40:24.838
Better be back there.

40:24.840 --> 40:26.276
We have
a security halt.

40:26.708 --> 40:27.909
Cover!

40:32.914 --> 40:34.447
Shit! It's not here.

40:34.449 --> 40:36.615
I had two mags of 50 cal
and the DAGR in it.

40:36.617 --> 40:37.918
Everybody mount up!

40:37.920 --> 40:40.052
We're going back
to the village.

40:40.054 --> 40:41.321
I guess we figured out why

40:41.323 --> 40:43.456
the villagers
didn't follow us.

40:43.458 --> 40:45.624
Congratulations,
Airman Stone,

40:45.626 --> 40:48.327
you just gave this man
permanent brain damage.

40:48.329 --> 40:49.697
But I thought
I needed to get

40:49.699 --> 40:51.331
an airway in.
He needs to breathe, right?

40:51.333 --> 40:52.999
You do. But did you notice
that our friend here

40:53.001 --> 40:54.367
has clear fluid in his ears?

40:54.369 --> 40:56.536
What might that clear
fluid be, Mr. Stone?

40:56.538 --> 40:58.170
Oh, shit.

40:58.172 --> 41:00.606
Not quite. Guess again.

41:00.608 --> 41:01.673
Spinal fluid, ma'am.

41:01.675 --> 41:03.175
Correct. Spinal fluid.

41:03.177 --> 41:05.177
And if your friend has
spinal fluid in his ears,

41:05.179 --> 41:06.412
what does that tell us?

41:06.414 --> 41:07.914
He could have damage
to his skull.

41:07.916 --> 41:09.782
Okay. So, to recap.

41:09.784 --> 41:11.217
You just walked up
to a guy who was

41:11.219 --> 41:12.985
already having a pretty
bad day to begin with

41:12.987 --> 41:15.588
and you shove a piece of
silicone into his brain.

41:15.590 --> 41:16.990
You just lobotomized him.

41:16.992 --> 41:19.025
Well, I figured I'd get that
in first so he could breathe

41:19.027 --> 41:20.827
and then I'd move on to his
other stuff.

41:20.829 --> 41:22.028
Okay, but sometimes you need

41:22.030 --> 41:23.396
to deal with
the bleeding first.

41:23.398 --> 41:24.664
So, I'd put
a tourniquet on it, then?

41:24.666 --> 41:25.932
Not always.

41:25.934 --> 41:27.434
What if the wound
was on the neck, say?

41:27.436 --> 41:30.202
A tourniquet on the neck
is better known as a noose.

41:30.204 --> 41:31.371
What do I do, then?

41:31.373 --> 41:33.740
In that case,
you say a prayer.

41:33.742 --> 41:36.012
And you hope something
creative occurs to you.

41:37.846 --> 41:39.514
That's some sound advice.

41:54.263 --> 41:56.396
Let's make this quick.

41:56.398 --> 41:59.164
- Put out security.
<i>- Roger that.</i>

41:59.166 --> 42:01.735
Skarlatos, stay here.

42:01.737 --> 42:03.103
Don't move. Don't move!

42:03.105 --> 42:04.674
Let's go.

42:33.201 --> 42:35.235
- What'd they want?
- A knife.

42:35.237 --> 42:38.106
Some shell casings.
Our shiny trash.

42:40.208 --> 42:42.543
Yeah,
it's all here except...

42:42.545 --> 42:43.409
Except what?

42:43.411 --> 42:45.945
My hat. With my name on it.

42:45.947 --> 42:48.447
Well, looks like
some unfortunate soul

42:48.449 --> 42:50.552
just got
the nickname Skarlatos.

42:51.686 --> 42:53.619
Let's go. Mount up!

42:53.621 --> 42:55.757
- Mount up!
- Mount up! Let's move.

43:02.731 --> 43:04.030
We in?

43:04.032 --> 43:05.401
Hit it.

43:11.072 --> 43:13.274
Lock those hands up!

43:13.276 --> 43:14.510
Get in there, Spence!

43:15.210 --> 43:17.213
Spence, go for the legs.

43:21.717 --> 43:23.950
Okay, now when you have
someone in a hold like this,

43:23.952 --> 43:25.885
use your free hand
to clamp down

43:25.887 --> 43:27.019
on the carotid artery.

43:27.021 --> 43:28.155
There you go!

43:28.157 --> 43:29.922
Spence, get it in.

43:29.924 --> 43:31.224
You think your opponent's

43:31.226 --> 43:32.747
just gonna let you
do that to him, huh?

43:35.263 --> 43:36.396
Spence, you don't got it.

43:36.398 --> 43:37.630
Line his chin up
with the elbow.

43:37.632 --> 43:39.599
I'm trying.

43:39.601 --> 43:41.199
Spence, get your hooks in,
go for the legs.

43:41.201 --> 43:42.969
Not just the arms.
Go for the legs.

43:42.971 --> 43:44.706
Don't give him any clues.

43:47.476 --> 43:48.874
Spence, get your hooks in.

43:48.876 --> 43:50.145
Come on, man!

43:52.114 --> 43:54.183
- Deeper.
- Spence, lock it up!

43:55.349 --> 43:56.652
All right,
you got him now!

43:57.753 --> 43:58.754
Whoo!

44:13.034 --> 44:14.967
<i>Alek, what up?</i>

44:14.969 --> 44:16.570
Spencer, hey, what's up?

44:16.572 --> 44:19.072
<i>I'm fine.
Getting good at this.</i>

44:19.074 --> 44:21.308
Good at what?
Like, checking rashes?

44:21.310 --> 44:22.909
No, I've been doing jiu-jitsu.

44:22.911 --> 44:24.644
I'm starting to finally
figure this shit out.

44:24.646 --> 44:27.079
Not getting my ass beat
every match, at least.

44:27.081 --> 44:28.380
<i>Well, that's good.</i>

44:28.382 --> 44:29.882
<i>There's, like,
nothing to do over here.</i>

44:29.884 --> 44:31.383
But you're in Afghanistan.

44:31.385 --> 44:33.321
Yeah, well, nobody cares about
Afghanistan anymore.

44:33.323 --> 44:35.288
Now the real bad guys
are ISIS.

44:35.290 --> 44:36.889
<i>Not many of those over there?</i>

44:36.891 --> 44:40.961
No, I'm like a security guard.
Basically just a mall cop.

44:40.963 --> 44:43.195
Well, adventure starts soon.

44:43.197 --> 44:44.498
Did Strasser ever decide
if he's coming

44:44.500 --> 44:46.132
with us
on the Great European Tour?

44:46.134 --> 44:47.333
<i>Yeah, no, he can't go.</i>

44:47.335 --> 44:48.835
<i>I'm thinking about
asking Solon,</i>

44:48.837 --> 44:50.270
<i>but I don't think he's going
to have enough money.</i>

44:50.272 --> 44:52.405
Okay. Well,
just let me know, man.

44:52.407 --> 44:54.106
I'm getting excited.

44:54.108 --> 44:55.474
<i>Yeah, you have no idea.</i>

44:55.476 --> 44:56.943
<i>I'm desperate
to get out of here.</i>

44:56.945 --> 44:58.744
<i>I still think we need
to park it in Germany</i>

44:58.746 --> 45:00.445
<i>for a while, though.</i>

45:00.447 --> 45:02.516
Yeah, it's just that,

45:02.518 --> 45:04.650
there's so much I wanna see,
you know?

45:04.652 --> 45:06.452
And chances are
this will probably be

45:06.454 --> 45:09.222
one of the last times I'll get
to do something like this.

45:09.224 --> 45:11.356
<i>Look, I know you have
that girl there.</i>

45:11.358 --> 45:13.927
<i>What was she?
An exchange student?</i>

45:13.929 --> 45:15.360
Yeah, in Oregon.

45:15.362 --> 45:16.896
We just keep in touch.

45:16.898 --> 45:20.166
<i>And she invited you to stay
with her in Germany?</i>

45:20.168 --> 45:21.568
Yeah, but it's not just that.

45:21.570 --> 45:23.869
I just kind of wanna
soak it in a little bit.

45:23.871 --> 45:26.773
I don't wanna be moving around
every day.

45:26.775 --> 45:29.409
<i>I mean, we don't get to go
on leave that often.</i>

45:29.411 --> 45:31.244
Yeah, well, if you just wanna
stay in Germany, man,

45:31.246 --> 45:32.778
that's cool. Just do that.

45:32.780 --> 45:34.646
<i>Yeah, well, I mean,
my family history is there.</i>

45:34.648 --> 45:36.048
<i>And they're the reason
I wanted</i>

45:36.050 --> 45:37.950
<i>to join the military
in the first place.</i>

45:37.952 --> 45:39.786
Well, we don't have
to decide right now.

45:39.788 --> 45:41.629
Hey, whatever happened
to that sniper training?

45:42.556 --> 45:44.423
I'll tell you
about that later.

45:44.425 --> 45:47.025
Uh, basically,
I'm just really bored.

45:47.027 --> 45:50.597
<i>That sucks. I'm over here
having a freakin' blast!</i>

45:50.599 --> 45:54.333
<i>Drinking beers, hanging on
the beach, doing jiu-jitsu.</i>

45:54.335 --> 45:56.503
<i>Portugal is paradise.</i>

45:56.505 --> 45:58.672
You're a piece of shit.

45:58.674 --> 46:00.039
What's that?
You must be breaking up.

46:00.041 --> 46:01.641
Sounded like
you called me a piece of shit!

46:01.643 --> 46:03.342
<i>All right, well,
it's like midnight here.</i>

46:03.344 --> 46:04.711
<i>I gotta go to bed.</i>

46:04.713 --> 46:07.079
All right, hang in there,
brother. Later.

46:07.081 --> 46:08.384
<i>All right.</i>

46:22.096 --> 46:25.265
<i>Stone. First name Spencer.
What's up, my guy?</i>

46:25.267 --> 46:26.666
Chilling, man.
What are you doing?

46:26.668 --> 46:28.335
<i>You know,
just the morning routine.</i>

46:28.337 --> 46:29.836
Chilling. Any action
over there yet?

46:29.838 --> 46:31.603
<i>Nah, this is
a pretty cake assignment.</i>

46:31.605 --> 46:32.972
<i>But, listen,
I got an idea for you.</i>

46:32.974 --> 46:34.673
<i>Me and Alek
were just talking about</i>

46:34.675 --> 46:36.710
<i>doing a backpacking trip
all over Europe.</i>

46:36.712 --> 46:37.811
You should, man.
You could be posted

46:37.813 --> 46:39.478
anywhere after this one,
right?

46:39.480 --> 46:41.079
Yeah, but I'm trying to say
you should come with us.

46:41.081 --> 46:44.285
<i>Wait, wait.
You mean, meet you in Europe?</i>

46:44.287 --> 46:45.784
Yeah, son. It'll be crazy.

46:45.786 --> 46:47.487
You have the summer off,
don't you?

46:47.489 --> 46:49.989
Man, come on, you know I don't
got money like that.

46:49.991 --> 46:52.791
<i>Just take out a credit card.
You'll pay it back.</i>

46:52.793 --> 46:54.594
<i>Ah, I see them headphones.
You must be working</i>

46:54.596 --> 46:56.362
<i>for a credit card
company now, huh?</i>

46:56.364 --> 46:57.664
<i>Just see what you qualify for.</i>

46:57.666 --> 46:59.267
That's crazy
you say that though.

46:59.269 --> 47:00.633
I was just talking
to my coworker

47:00.635 --> 47:01.867
about getting a credit card

47:01.869 --> 47:03.503
with frequent
flyer miles, too.

47:03.505 --> 47:07.574
Anthony, it's meant to be,
dawg. Come on.

47:07.576 --> 47:09.409
<i>All right, man, screw it.
I'm in.</i>

47:24.692 --> 47:26.057
Hey! What's up, man.
You made it.

47:26.059 --> 47:27.793
What's up, bro?

47:27.795 --> 47:29.128
Hold on, let me grab
my bag real quick.

47:29.130 --> 47:30.197
All right.

47:30.199 --> 47:31.865
Come on, let's go check in.

47:31.867 --> 47:34.432
Isn't this crazy?
We made it to Europe, though.

47:34.434 --> 47:37.303
I know, man. Look around.

47:37.305 --> 47:40.375
Hold on, hold on. We gotta get
a shot of this real quick.

47:42.811 --> 47:44.543
There it is.

47:44.545 --> 47:46.244
Come on, man. I've been
waiting out here forever.

47:46.246 --> 47:47.582
All right, all right.

47:50.617 --> 47:52.719
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hello. Welcome to Roma.

47:52.721 --> 47:54.387
- Thanks.
- Last name?

47:54.389 --> 47:56.058
- Uh, Stone.
- Stone.

47:57.559 --> 47:59.292
Perfect. Well,
I have your room for two.

47:59.294 --> 48:00.594
Would you like two keys, then?

48:00.596 --> 48:02.094
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

48:02.096 --> 48:04.331
And is this your first time
staying with us?

48:04.333 --> 48:05.932
Uh, it's actually
our first time in Italy.

48:05.934 --> 48:08.133
Oh, welcome.
Well, in that case,

48:08.135 --> 48:09.769
if you don't have
any plans for tonight,

48:09.771 --> 48:12.272
we have a party bus
leaving from our bar.

48:12.274 --> 48:15.340
And they call it
the Perversion Excursion,

48:15.342 --> 48:16.710
if that translates.

48:16.712 --> 48:18.610
Oh, yeah,
I think it translates.

48:18.612 --> 48:19.979
Would you like me
to sign you up?

48:19.981 --> 48:21.148
Yes, please.

48:21.150 --> 48:22.481
I think we're gonna have
a good time in Italy.

48:22.483 --> 48:23.815
Yeah, I think so.

48:23.817 --> 48:25.351
Well, I hope
you're seeing all the sights

48:25.353 --> 48:26.619
before your excursion.

48:26.621 --> 48:29.155
Oh, yeah. We plan
on seeing all the sights.

48:29.157 --> 48:30.492
Mmm.

48:37.199 --> 48:38.965
We made it
to the Coliseum, baby.

48:38.967 --> 48:40.967
It's crazy that
they built this back then.

48:40.969 --> 48:42.668
Can you believe
how big it is?

48:42.670 --> 48:43.836
And can you believe people

48:43.838 --> 48:45.204
used to kill each other
in there?

48:45.206 --> 48:46.672
'Cause imagine
watching that now,

48:46.674 --> 48:48.675
somebody fight a lion.

48:48.677 --> 48:50.744
Are you not entertained?

48:50.746 --> 48:52.110
Do you give him
a thumbs up

48:52.112 --> 48:53.244
or a thumbs down?

48:53.246 --> 48:55.014
Thumbs down.

48:55.016 --> 48:56.449
Kill him.

48:56.451 --> 48:58.885
Lot of old shit here.
That's for sure.

48:58.887 --> 49:00.619
<i>You trying to throw
some coins in or something?</i>

49:00.621 --> 49:01.987
Just throw it backwards.

49:01.989 --> 49:04.359
- Throw it backwards?
- Yeah, if you want to.

49:07.628 --> 49:09.061
Did it make it?

49:09.063 --> 49:11.364
I don't know. We'll see
if we ever come back.

49:11.366 --> 49:12.465
Let's go down there, yeah.

49:12.467 --> 49:14.467
Then we'll know we made it.

49:14.469 --> 49:17.503
And again, one, two, three.

49:17.505 --> 49:18.670
Oh, yeah, that's good.
What you think?

49:18.672 --> 49:20.206
Hold on, what you think?

49:20.208 --> 49:21.641
Oh, yeah, you got the shot.
You got it, you got it.

49:21.643 --> 49:23.075
We gotta post that for sure.

49:23.077 --> 49:25.646
This is it, baby.
The Trevi Fountain.

49:27.447 --> 49:28.916
Don't fall over.

49:32.654 --> 49:34.119
Let's take a selfie
or something real quick.

49:34.121 --> 49:37.090
You know, we gotta capture
this moment. You feel me?

49:37.092 --> 49:39.762
Race you up the stairs.

49:42.130 --> 49:43.630
Ah, you slow.

49:43.632 --> 49:44.963
That must be where
the pope lives, you know?

49:44.965 --> 49:46.699
I don't even know.

49:46.701 --> 49:49.235
Is that the Vatican?
What is that?

49:49.237 --> 49:50.969
If you're standing
right here,

49:50.971 --> 49:53.505
you're directly in the center
of all these columns.

49:53.507 --> 49:55.074
Hold on, I gotta take
a picture of that.

49:55.076 --> 49:57.111
That's crazy.

50:00.815 --> 50:01.884
Wow.

50:09.391 --> 50:10.923
Trying to head back?

50:10.925 --> 50:13.193
Yeah. Let's go back
to the hostel.

50:13.195 --> 50:14.561
It was a good day.

50:14.563 --> 50:16.532
Yeah, let's get ready
for that excursion.

50:20.201 --> 50:21.469
Lea!

50:22.036 --> 50:23.670
Alek? Hi!

50:23.672 --> 50:25.874
- Hey, what's up?
- Jump in.

50:31.312 --> 50:32.677
- So good to see you.
- Hi!

50:32.679 --> 50:35.047
Welcome to Germany.

50:35.049 --> 50:36.182
Thank you.

50:36.184 --> 50:37.652
Let's go.

50:46.161 --> 50:49.362
Yo,
this shit is unreal.

50:49.364 --> 50:51.463
I'm saying.

50:56.637 --> 50:58.973
It's why they call it
backpacking, bro.

51:02.543 --> 51:04.811
Can we just please
get to the hostel, man,

51:04.813 --> 51:06.679
before I throw this damn bag
in the canal?

51:06.681 --> 51:08.648
Or I throw your ass in first.

51:08.650 --> 51:09.849
Hey, you're the one who almost

51:09.851 --> 51:11.349
cost us the trip
on the first night.

51:11.351 --> 51:12.585
Yeah, now I'm the guy

51:12.587 --> 51:14.321
traveling in Europe
on a broken ankle.

51:14.323 --> 51:15.789
Whatever, man.

51:15.791 --> 51:17.590
We need to catch one of these
taxis or whatever.

51:17.592 --> 51:19.726
These boats or something.

51:19.728 --> 51:21.226
Is this where we get on,
right here?

51:21.228 --> 51:22.594
Yeah, I think so.

51:22.596 --> 51:23.762
Are you sure?
Do you even know?

51:23.764 --> 51:25.299
I don't
even know, man.

51:25.301 --> 51:26.935
Let's just go figure it out.

51:28.369 --> 51:29.568
- Hello.
- Hello.

51:29.570 --> 51:31.503
Hello.

51:31.505 --> 51:32.572
Did you see
those pretzels?

51:32.574 --> 51:33.940
Oh, my God. They look so good.

51:33.942 --> 51:35.541
Yeah.

51:35.543 --> 51:37.175
So is it everything
you dreamed?

51:37.177 --> 51:39.914
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
This is amazing.

51:40.916 --> 51:42.815
Do you know
which table was his?

51:42.817 --> 51:44.983
Ah, I'm not sure
if he had a table per se,

51:44.985 --> 51:46.519
but if I know
my Grandpa Nick...

51:46.521 --> 51:47.753
- Yeah.
- Probably would have

51:47.755 --> 51:49.655
- sat right there. Yeah.
- Okay.

51:49.657 --> 51:50.992
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

51:55.697 --> 51:57.030
It's nice.

51:57.032 --> 51:58.530
Yeah.

52:03.804 --> 52:05.170
What did you get us?

52:05.172 --> 52:07.340
- Two beers.
- Oh, awesome. Great.

52:07.342 --> 52:08.708
Okay.

52:08.710 --> 52:11.143
So, you're not going
to tell me the story?

52:11.145 --> 52:13.246
Ah, well, it's not really
much of a story.

52:13.248 --> 52:14.281
Silly.

52:14.283 --> 52:16.048
My father says
everyone has a story

52:16.050 --> 52:17.849
and it's our duty to tell it.

52:17.851 --> 52:20.186
Well, all I know for sure
is that about

52:20.188 --> 52:23.588
sixty-two years ago,
my grandpa sat right here.

52:23.590 --> 52:24.923
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

52:24.925 --> 52:26.157
My grandpa sat right here

52:26.159 --> 52:27.693
and celebrated
getting his stripes.

52:27.695 --> 52:29.795
- Becoming a sergeant?
- Yeah.

52:29.797 --> 52:31.431
In the German forces?

52:31.433 --> 52:32.999
No. No. Uh, American.
He, uh...

52:33.001 --> 52:34.733
He was raised in New York,

52:34.735 --> 52:36.771
and he was stationed here
during World War II.

52:37.538 --> 52:39.838
Okay, so, here you are.

52:39.840 --> 52:42.007
Following in his footsteps.

52:42.009 --> 52:44.844
Yeah. I guess so, in a way.

52:44.846 --> 52:46.845
I'm so happy that you're here.

52:46.847 --> 52:48.349
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

52:56.958 --> 52:58.757
Wow, look at that view.

52:58.759 --> 53:00.425
Man, I haven't been able
to get a good picture

53:00.427 --> 53:01.594
this entire time
we've been here.

53:01.596 --> 53:02.927
Bro, just use my selfie stick.

53:02.929 --> 53:04.197
You'll get
all the background in it too.

53:04.199 --> 53:05.630
Why don't you just take
a picture of me?

53:05.632 --> 53:07.465
Hell no.
I'm tired from this heat,

53:07.467 --> 53:09.936
and those eight thousand miles
you made us walk today.

53:09.938 --> 53:11.503
Well, bro, I'm not about
to use a selfie stick,

53:11.505 --> 53:13.438
and stick out even more
than we already are.

53:13.440 --> 53:16.108
Right. 'Cause that'll make us
stick out any more.

53:21.916 --> 53:24.184
Hey, excuse me.
Do you speak English?

53:24.186 --> 53:25.383
Yeah, I do.

53:25.385 --> 53:28.086
Do you think you could
take a picture of me?

53:28.088 --> 53:29.588
Don't ask.
He's grumpy right now.

53:29.590 --> 53:32.358
- He doesn't wanna do it.
- Okay. Yeah. Sure.

53:32.360 --> 53:33.362
Cool. Thank you.

53:35.030 --> 53:35.994
Okay.

53:35.996 --> 53:39.432
One, two, three.

53:39.434 --> 53:41.700
Oh. It's kind of dark.
You wanna check it?

53:41.702 --> 53:43.303
I'm sure you got it.
Let me see.

53:43.305 --> 53:44.903
Yeah, that looks good.
Thank you.

53:44.905 --> 53:46.206
- I appreciate it.
- Yeah, of course.

53:46.208 --> 53:47.539
I'm Spencer.

53:47.541 --> 53:48.907
- Lisa.
- Nice to meet you, Lisa.

53:48.909 --> 53:50.208
- Nice to meet you.
- This is Anthony.

53:50.210 --> 53:52.811
He tragically can't stand up
right now.

53:52.813 --> 53:54.880
- How you doing?
- Nice to meet you.

53:54.882 --> 53:56.849
So what
are you up to?

53:56.851 --> 53:59.450
First day in the city.
Just taking a trip around.

53:59.452 --> 54:00.653
Nice. Us too.

54:00.655 --> 54:01.887
We're going over
to the San Marco Square.

54:01.889 --> 54:04.190
- You wanna go with us?
- Yeah. Sure.

54:04.192 --> 54:05.657
Yeah. All right, come on.
Take a seat.

54:05.659 --> 54:06.862
Okay.

54:07.728 --> 54:09.061
Thanks.

54:09.063 --> 54:11.597
- So where are you from?
- Uh, LA.

54:11.599 --> 54:12.831
Oh, nice. Yeah,

54:12.833 --> 54:14.400
- we're from Sacramento.
- Oh, nice.

54:14.402 --> 54:15.700
Three California kids in Italy?
What are the chances?

54:15.702 --> 54:16.836
Seriously.

54:16.838 --> 54:18.503
- Small world.
- Yeah, I know.

54:18.505 --> 54:19.739
Guys, say what you want,

54:19.741 --> 54:21.240
but we can't waste
this opportunity.

54:21.242 --> 54:23.108
- Look, we gotta take a selfie.
- It is pretty stunning.

54:23.110 --> 54:24.710
- It is, yeah.
- All right.

54:24.712 --> 54:26.347
Let's all get in it.

54:29.983 --> 54:32.385
Ah.

54:32.387 --> 54:34.186
- Let's check it out.
- That's pretty good.

54:34.188 --> 54:35.353
I gotta
give it to you, man.

54:35.355 --> 54:36.722
The selfie stick
is where it's at.

54:36.724 --> 54:37.992
I told you.
See. Look.

54:38.659 --> 54:40.761
That's Instagram-worthy.

54:49.170 --> 54:50.737
We gotta
get some gelato.

54:50.739 --> 54:52.170
Ah, this looks amazing.

54:52.172 --> 54:55.007
<i>Buongiorno!</i>

54:55.009 --> 54:56.541
Oh, I love
a good mint chip.

54:56.543 --> 54:58.344
Oh, my gosh.
I need this right now.

54:58.346 --> 54:59.945
Can I try the wild fruit,
please?

54:59.947 --> 55:01.949
- Wild fruit?
- Yeah.

55:04.152 --> 55:05.518
What are you getting?

55:05.520 --> 55:07.420
Can I get the mint
chocolate chip, please?

55:07.422 --> 55:08.487
Mint chocolate for you?

55:08.489 --> 55:09.854
- Yes, please.
- That looks good, too.

55:09.856 --> 55:11.324
Which one
are you gonna get?

55:11.326 --> 55:13.925
Think I might get
the hazelnut right there.

55:13.927 --> 55:15.494
<i>Grazie.</i>

55:15.496 --> 55:17.896
And then can I get
the hazelnut?

55:17.898 --> 55:19.565
And hazelnut for you.

55:19.567 --> 55:21.333
My treat, guys. My treat.

55:21.335 --> 55:23.303
It's amazing, guys.

55:23.305 --> 55:24.869
Oh, my God.

55:24.871 --> 55:26.373
- It's good?
- Mmm-hmm.

55:27.708 --> 55:29.507
Has to be good.

55:29.509 --> 55:31.278
It's the best in town.

55:31.280 --> 55:32.279
Thank you.

55:32.281 --> 55:33.945
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

55:33.947 --> 55:35.318
Thank you. Bye-bye.

55:35.849 --> 55:37.319
Thank you.

55:39.287 --> 55:41.588
Ooh, this place
is so dark.

55:41.590 --> 55:43.655
Oh, and I'm pretty sure
you're not allowed

55:43.657 --> 55:45.224
to take photos in here,
Anthony.

55:45.226 --> 55:47.525
Yeah, now you can
finally put that stick away.

55:49.030 --> 55:51.030
Whoa, guys.
Hold your horses.

55:51.032 --> 55:52.431
Wow. Really, bro?

55:52.433 --> 55:53.898
I thought it was
pretty funny.

55:55.402 --> 55:57.336
Man, you don't see
stuff like this back home.

55:57.338 --> 55:58.737
That's for sure.

55:58.739 --> 55:59.838
This would actually look cool

55:59.840 --> 56:01.206
in front of the capitol,
though.

56:01.208 --> 56:02.809
So, you guys wanna
go get some food now?

56:02.811 --> 56:04.210
Yeah, I'm starving.

56:04.212 --> 56:05.943
Are you as hungry
as a horse maybe?

56:08.183 --> 56:11.052
- Ooh!
- Looks good.

56:17.625 --> 56:19.492
So what do you think
of our plans so far?

56:19.494 --> 56:20.827
You think we're gonna
see enough?

56:20.829 --> 56:22.161
You're the world
traveler here.

56:22.163 --> 56:24.429
Yeah. I think
it all sounds pretty good.

56:25.933 --> 56:27.465
Except for Paris.

56:27.467 --> 56:29.168
How come? You didn't have,
like, the best time there?

56:29.170 --> 56:32.272
Ah, Paris was okay for me.
But I don't know.

56:32.274 --> 56:34.541
Maybe you guys will have
a different experience.

56:34.543 --> 56:36.074
That's actually funny
you said that.

56:36.076 --> 56:37.577
We were, like, debating
should we even

56:37.579 --> 56:38.844
fit it into our trip or not.

56:38.846 --> 56:41.646
- Yeah.
- What do you think?

56:41.648 --> 56:43.949
I mean, I wanna see it.
I think we should, you know?

56:43.951 --> 56:45.351
Just go experience it
for ourselves.

56:45.353 --> 56:47.686
Might as well.
While we're here, you know.

56:47.688 --> 56:50.722
But for today, we have Venice.

56:50.724 --> 56:52.090
- That is true.
- That is true.

56:52.092 --> 56:53.828
<i>Salute!</i>

56:57.898 --> 56:59.999
- It's good, too.
- Yeah.

57:00.001 --> 57:01.900
What are you guys
gonna get?

57:01.902 --> 57:03.270
- Pizza! Pizza!
- Pizza.

57:03.272 --> 57:04.135
Pizza!

57:04.137 --> 57:05.237
Craving it all today.

57:05.239 --> 57:07.505
- I know.
- I know. For real.

57:11.280 --> 57:13.314
Wow, this view is amazing.

57:13.316 --> 57:14.813
Yeah, it's nice.

57:14.815 --> 57:16.384
No, I'm good.

57:17.684 --> 57:21.219
It's crazy. You can see
the whole city from up here.

57:21.221 --> 57:22.990
Yeah, man.

57:26.226 --> 57:27.992
I feel like all we've been
doing is traveling.

57:27.994 --> 57:30.762
We might need to like, slow it
down a little bit, you know?

57:30.764 --> 57:32.331
Anthony, my man, you slow...

57:32.333 --> 57:35.301
...down, you die. I know.
Yeah, yeah.

57:35.303 --> 57:37.538
Maybe this is just, like,
a little different, though.

57:38.538 --> 57:39.606
Yeah, I don't know, man.

57:39.608 --> 57:40.972
You ever just feel like
life is just

57:40.974 --> 57:42.507
catapulting you
towards something?

57:42.509 --> 57:44.378
Some greater purpose?

57:45.846 --> 57:47.279
You sure
that's just a cigarette?

57:47.281 --> 57:49.815
If not,
I might need to hit that.

57:51.885 --> 57:53.552
No, man, I'm serious. Like...

57:53.554 --> 57:55.753
Sometimes, I don't even feel
like I have a choice, you know.

57:55.755 --> 57:58.023
Like life is just pushing us
towards something.

57:58.025 --> 57:59.358
Maybe it's, like,
life is meant to

57:59.360 --> 58:02.228
slow us down sometimes,
too, you know.

58:02.230 --> 58:05.498
Yeah, well,
not today, my friend.

58:05.500 --> 58:07.699
We gotta get up early
for Berlin tomorrow.

58:07.701 --> 58:09.601
Rescue Alek
from that exchange student.

58:09.603 --> 58:12.472
Ugh. You're right.
On to the next, I guess it is.

58:12.474 --> 58:14.274
- Yep.
- I'm pretty tired myself.

58:14.276 --> 58:15.974
It's been a long day.

58:15.976 --> 58:17.312
Almost there.

58:18.281 --> 58:19.414
This way.

58:24.085 --> 58:25.920
Keep up.

58:33.193 --> 58:35.298
All together this way.

58:42.036 --> 58:44.670
And now you see
this is a very important site.

58:44.672 --> 58:46.637
This is the Fuhrerbunker.

58:46.639 --> 58:48.907
This is one of the more
important sites

58:48.909 --> 58:50.441
in our history,

58:50.443 --> 58:53.246
and it is one of the, perhaps,
lesser studied sites.

58:53.248 --> 58:56.414
This is where Hitler
killed himself,

58:56.416 --> 58:57.715
as Russian forces
were closing in.

58:57.717 --> 58:59.050
Wait, for real?

59:00.119 --> 59:01.487
But I thought

59:01.489 --> 59:02.889
Hitler killed himself
in the Eagle's Nest,

59:02.891 --> 59:04.757
with the American forces
closing in.

59:04.759 --> 59:07.760
No, your American
textbooks are wrong

59:07.762 --> 59:10.396
by about 700 kilometers.

59:10.398 --> 59:12.298
The Kehlsteinhaus
is down in the south

59:12.300 --> 59:14.301
and Hitler was here
with his wife, Eva,

59:14.303 --> 59:16.303
and it was the Russians
who were closing in.

59:16.305 --> 59:18.070
You Americans
can't take credit

59:18.072 --> 59:21.005
every time
evil is defeated. <i>Ja?</i>

59:24.445 --> 59:25.981
Off we go.

59:26.480 --> 59:27.715
This way.

59:29.349 --> 59:32.717
<i>♪ Springtime for Hitler</i>

59:32.719 --> 59:34.820
<i>♪ And Germany ♪</i>

59:34.822 --> 59:36.755
Left.

59:36.757 --> 59:38.023
Hey, I'm about to go check

59:38.025 --> 59:39.391
my emails or something.
Text my dad.

59:39.393 --> 59:40.659
All right. I'm just gonna go
grab a drink.

59:40.661 --> 59:41.793
I'll be back in, like,
a little bit.

59:41.795 --> 59:43.028
All right, sounds good.

59:48.568 --> 59:50.135
- Hi, how you doing?
- <i>Hallo.</i>

59:50.137 --> 59:51.603
Can I just get a pint, please?

59:51.605 --> 59:54.173
Stein. Beer.

59:54.175 --> 59:56.044
- <i>Ja.</i>
- Thank you.

59:59.146 --> 01:00:00.378
So what do you think
about France?

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:01.880
Do you think it's worth going?

01:00:03.617 --> 01:00:05.083
- Uh...
- Um...

01:00:05.085 --> 01:00:06.285
Where are you from?

01:00:06.287 --> 01:00:08.353
Oh, uh, California.
Sacramento.

01:00:08.355 --> 01:00:10.789
Awesome. California.

01:00:10.791 --> 01:00:13.559
A beer for me, please.
Where are you headed next?

01:00:13.561 --> 01:00:15.394
Uh, we're gonna go to France,

01:00:15.396 --> 01:00:17.195
and then I think we're gonna
finish our trip off in Spain.

01:00:17.197 --> 01:00:18.731
And Amsterdam?

01:00:18.733 --> 01:00:19.798
Ah, we thought about it.

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:21.066
I don't think we're gonna
have enough time.

01:00:21.068 --> 01:00:23.269
Oh, make time for Amsterdam.

01:00:23.271 --> 01:00:25.204
I just got back from there
with my band.

01:00:25.206 --> 01:00:26.505
Excuse me.

01:00:26.507 --> 01:00:29.507
And I tell you,
one of my favorite things

01:00:29.509 --> 01:00:31.545
to do when we're up there.

01:00:32.112 --> 01:00:33.378
What's that?

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:35.646
I got some truffles.

01:00:35.648 --> 01:00:38.650
Head out to the countryside.
And you know what I do then?

01:00:38.652 --> 01:00:39.818
What? What's that?

01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:43.422
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
I do nothing.

01:00:43.424 --> 01:00:47.292
I just look at the nature,
birds, songs.

01:00:47.294 --> 01:00:49.128
They sing everything.

01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:50.461
That doesn't sound
too bad to me.

01:00:50.463 --> 01:00:51.864
- Making friends?
- Yeah, man. This is Anthony.

01:00:51.866 --> 01:00:53.032
Oh, hello. How are you?

01:00:53.034 --> 01:00:54.400
How you doing?
Nice to meet you.

01:00:54.402 --> 01:00:56.200
He's been telling me
about Amsterdam.

01:00:56.202 --> 01:00:57.568
- Oh, for real?
- Oh, Amsterdam.

01:00:57.570 --> 01:00:59.739
- Good things?
- Very good things.

01:00:59.741 --> 01:01:01.474
If you don't take
all the drug I do,

01:01:01.476 --> 01:01:03.342
Amsterdam is fantastic.

01:01:03.344 --> 01:01:05.543
The most nice people
in the world.

01:01:05.545 --> 01:01:06.911
That's what
we've been hearing.

01:01:06.913 --> 01:01:09.447
And beautiful women, too.

01:01:09.449 --> 01:01:12.285
- That's what we are after.
- We might have to go see that.

01:01:12.287 --> 01:01:13.585
We just might have to.

01:01:13.587 --> 01:01:15.521
And history.
Don't forget the history.

01:01:15.523 --> 01:01:17.222
Of course, the history.

01:01:17.224 --> 01:01:19.023
All history
is necessary for life.

01:01:20.294 --> 01:01:21.626
- To Amsterdam.
- To Amsterdam.

01:01:21.628 --> 01:01:23.195
- It's settled.
- He persuaded us.

01:01:23.197 --> 01:01:25.563
It's done. Just like that.

01:01:53.895 --> 01:01:56.896
Can I get two Red Bull
and vodkas and one beer?

01:01:56.898 --> 01:01:58.199
Sure.

01:02:08.342 --> 01:02:10.744
Alek, here, hand one to him.

01:02:15.416 --> 01:02:17.250
- Hey, it's different, huh?
- What is?

01:02:17.252 --> 01:02:18.816
This. Different from what
you've been doing.

01:02:18.818 --> 01:02:21.153
Man, it's the same damn thing
we've been doing.

01:02:21.155 --> 01:02:22.521
Remember the Perversion
Excursion, baby?

01:02:22.523 --> 01:02:23.621
Hey, come on, now.

01:02:23.623 --> 01:02:25.023
You know
I don't remember that.

01:02:25.025 --> 01:02:26.492
Is this really
what you guys have been

01:02:26.494 --> 01:02:27.860
doing this whole time
without me?

01:02:27.862 --> 01:02:29.362
Yeah, man.
Aren't you glad you came?

01:02:29.364 --> 01:02:31.331
I really am.

01:03:10.305 --> 01:03:12.407
- Yeah!
- Bought you drinks.

01:03:29.757 --> 01:03:30.822
Hey!

01:03:30.824 --> 01:03:34.025
- Cheers! Cheers!
- Hey, let me get in that.

01:03:34.027 --> 01:03:35.159
Cheers!

01:03:37.231 --> 01:03:39.934
Hey! I'm about
to make it rain!

01:03:41.001 --> 01:03:42.434
<i>Not as easy as it looks.</i>

01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:56.715
Guys, we need to get up.
It's almost noon.

01:04:01.155 --> 01:04:04.190
I feel miserable.

01:04:04.192 --> 01:04:06.894
Last night.
Man, last night.

01:04:09.663 --> 01:04:12.000
I still can't believe
I got on that stripper pole.

01:04:13.101 --> 01:04:14.934
So hungover.

01:04:14.936 --> 01:04:17.272
Let's go get some food
or something.

01:04:26.579 --> 01:04:28.479
- No, no.
- No, no.

01:04:28.481 --> 01:04:29.851
No, thank you. Just water.

01:04:30.751 --> 01:04:33.719
- More water please.
- Okay.

01:04:33.721 --> 01:04:36.288
Man, last night was crazy.
This morning, though.

01:04:36.290 --> 01:04:37.789
- Painful.
- That's the word.

01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:40.025
- Shit. Even words are...
- Painful.

01:04:40.027 --> 01:04:41.729
There it is.

01:04:43.398 --> 01:04:45.097
Guys, we need to talk
about Paris, though.

01:04:45.099 --> 01:04:46.998
I mean, like, at this point,
why even leave Amsterdam?

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.633
That was our best night yet.
Don't you think?

01:04:48.635 --> 01:04:49.967
Yeah. Weren't you guys
saying that

01:04:49.969 --> 01:04:51.936
everyone you ran into
was anti-Paris?

01:04:51.938 --> 01:04:53.104
I mean, I guess.

01:04:53.106 --> 01:04:54.539
They didn't have anything good
to say about it,

01:04:54.541 --> 01:04:55.974
that's for sure.

01:04:55.976 --> 01:04:58.876
Thank you. Or <i>grazie,</i>
or <i>danke.</i> Whatever.

01:04:58.878 --> 01:05:00.312
- Just thank you, thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:05:00.314 --> 01:05:02.414
So you guys
just wanna skip Paris?

01:05:02.416 --> 01:05:04.349
Or at least delay it
a little bit.

01:05:04.351 --> 01:05:06.351
I'm starving.

01:05:06.353 --> 01:05:07.820
Maybe it's like
you were saying,

01:05:07.822 --> 01:05:11.157
life's kind of catapulting you
towards something.

01:05:11.159 --> 01:05:14.126
Right now it's catapulting me
towards some hangover food.

01:05:14.128 --> 01:05:15.327
Wait, what did you say?

01:05:15.329 --> 01:05:16.494
I don't know, man.

01:05:16.496 --> 01:05:17.728
It was something
I said in Venice.

01:05:17.730 --> 01:05:18.963
I was caught up
in that European high.

01:05:18.965 --> 01:05:20.365
- I'm not gonna lie.
- No, no.

01:05:20.367 --> 01:05:21.499
You should have
heard this guy.

01:05:21.501 --> 01:05:22.666
He was talking
about how life is

01:05:22.668 --> 01:05:24.101
catapulting him
towards something,

01:05:24.103 --> 01:05:26.003
like some greater purpose
or something like that.

01:05:26.005 --> 01:05:28.940
- Spencer said that?
- I know. Deep shit, right?

01:05:28.942 --> 01:05:30.242
Do you still think that?

01:05:30.244 --> 01:05:31.476
I mean, I guess.

01:05:31.478 --> 01:05:33.177
But nothing's actually
stopping us.

01:05:33.179 --> 01:05:34.646
If we weren't meant
to be on the train tomorrow,

01:05:34.648 --> 01:05:36.081
something would
physically stop us.

01:05:36.083 --> 01:05:37.849
An object in motion
stays in motion,

01:05:37.851 --> 01:05:40.052
unless acted upon
by a greater force.

01:05:40.054 --> 01:05:41.254
Okay, Isaac Newton.

01:05:41.256 --> 01:05:42.787
I'm telling you, man,
he's been deep as hell

01:05:42.789 --> 01:05:44.655
on this trip.
I can't even deal with it.

01:05:44.657 --> 01:05:45.958
I mean, people are telling us

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:47.492
that the French
are the king of the rude.

01:05:47.494 --> 01:05:49.161
I wouldn't exactly call that
a greater force.

01:05:49.163 --> 01:05:51.161
Plus, we already bought
our train tickets, so...

01:05:51.163 --> 01:05:53.599
So, you guys just wanna stick
to the original plan?

01:05:53.601 --> 01:05:55.400
Might as well.

01:05:55.402 --> 01:05:57.722
I just need my selfie with the
Eiffel Tower and we're good.

01:06:12.085 --> 01:06:14.385
Hey, can you, like,
take a candid photo of me

01:06:14.387 --> 01:06:16.521
and the train station?

01:06:16.523 --> 01:06:18.557
All right.
You realize it's not candid

01:06:18.559 --> 01:06:19.990
if you ask me
to take it though, right?

01:06:19.992 --> 01:06:21.458
Just get me from the side
or something like that.

01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:23.130
All right.

01:06:25.532 --> 01:06:27.168
All right, there you go.

01:06:28.701 --> 01:06:30.402
You only took one photo.

01:06:30.404 --> 01:06:32.369
Yeah, so?
I think it looks good.

01:06:32.371 --> 01:06:33.604
I need multiples, man.

01:06:33.606 --> 01:06:34.572
'Cause I mean,
I know I look good.

01:06:34.574 --> 01:06:36.810
But I need options.

01:06:39.079 --> 01:06:40.545
Guys, come on.

01:06:40.547 --> 01:06:42.181
- That's us?
- Yeah, let's go.

01:06:42.183 --> 01:06:43.184
All right.

01:06:48.755 --> 01:06:50.625
- You ready?
- Let's do this.

01:06:57.463 --> 01:06:59.431
Look, there's some guys here.

01:06:59.433 --> 01:07:00.699
Excuse me. Terribly sorry.

01:07:00.701 --> 01:07:02.199
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:07:02.201 --> 01:07:03.869
Would you mind helping my dad
on board the train?

01:07:03.871 --> 01:07:05.838
- Oh, of course. Yeah, sure.
- With his suitcases.

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:07.472
Thank you so much.
That's so lovely.

01:07:07.474 --> 01:07:08.606
Give that to Spencer.

01:07:08.608 --> 01:07:09.840
Thank you very much.

01:07:09.842 --> 01:07:11.643
I'm sorry to accept
but it does help.

01:07:11.645 --> 01:07:13.244
- No problem.
- Thank you. That's so kind.

01:07:13.246 --> 01:07:15.579
If it doesn't go, you can
carry me all the way to Paris,

01:07:15.581 --> 01:07:18.250
- can't you?
- Uh, I'll give it a shot.

01:07:19.753 --> 01:07:21.254
Yeah, God bless you.

01:07:21.256 --> 01:07:22.753
Excuse me. Thank you.

01:07:22.755 --> 01:07:24.256
- Thank you very much.
- Watch your step here.

01:07:24.258 --> 01:07:25.590
That'll be fine. Yes.

01:07:25.592 --> 01:07:28.559
Yeah. God bless you.
Thank you very much.

01:07:28.561 --> 01:07:30.697
Yes. Thank you so much.

01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:35.099
Our seats are those.
Yes, they are.

01:07:35.101 --> 01:07:37.568
We're here.
Thank you so much.

01:07:37.570 --> 01:07:39.470
- Okay.
- God bless you guys.

01:07:39.472 --> 01:07:41.840
- No problem.
- Yes. Ah!

01:07:41.842 --> 01:07:43.675
- Thank you so much. Wonderful.
- Thank you.

01:07:43.677 --> 01:07:45.110
- Have a good trip.
- You too.

01:07:45.112 --> 01:07:46.711
You guys have a great trip.
Thank you.

01:07:46.713 --> 01:07:48.079
- Thank you, thank you.
- No problem, sir.

01:07:48.081 --> 01:07:50.449
Bye-bye.
- You guys just wanna sit here?

01:07:50.451 --> 01:07:52.351
Yeah. Looks good.

01:07:59.626 --> 01:08:01.960
Bye, Amsterdam.

01:08:01.962 --> 01:08:03.695
I'm kind of sad to leave it.
It was fun.

01:08:03.697 --> 01:08:04.795
- I know, really.
- Me too.

01:08:04.797 --> 01:08:06.032
It was a blast.

01:08:18.411 --> 01:08:22.246
All right. I'm tired of this.
And I'm bored.

01:08:22.247 --> 01:08:23.969
I'm gonna go check
the Wi-Fi in first class.

01:08:25.519 --> 01:08:26.886
- I'll be back.
- All right.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:29.920
We should have
brought some snacks.

01:08:29.921 --> 01:08:31.790
You know he gets cranky.

01:08:31.792 --> 01:08:33.491
Even I could go for a snack.

01:08:33.493 --> 01:08:34.926
Probably the perks
of first class.

01:08:34.929 --> 01:08:37.562
Maybe we should go
find those seats.

01:08:37.564 --> 01:08:39.130
Right now,
I just need some Wi-Fi

01:08:39.131 --> 01:08:40.665
so I can upload
these pictures.

01:08:47.808 --> 01:08:48.973
Found it.

01:08:48.975 --> 01:08:50.341
First class is up there

01:08:50.344 --> 01:08:51.642
and the Wi-Fi
is way better. Let's go up.

01:08:51.644 --> 01:08:52.879
- Sweet.
- Perfect.

01:08:57.885 --> 01:08:59.817
It was nice meeting you.
Safe travels.

01:08:59.819 --> 01:09:01.256
Thanks so much.

01:09:11.465 --> 01:09:13.397
This is way nicer.

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:15.000
I told ya.

01:09:15.002 --> 01:09:16.433
I'm gonna get
that window seat.

01:09:16.435 --> 01:09:17.702
Sure, man. Whatever.

01:09:17.703 --> 01:09:19.937
Thanks.

01:09:19.939 --> 01:09:22.076
I'm gonna take the solo.

01:09:40.894 --> 01:09:43.694
Snacks coming in,
twelve o'clock.

01:09:43.697 --> 01:09:45.763
Gentlemen,
may I offer you

01:09:45.765 --> 01:09:46.964
some snacks or a drink?

01:09:46.966 --> 01:09:49.567
- Yeah. Could I get a Coke?
- Sure.

01:09:49.569 --> 01:09:50.871
Thank you.

01:09:52.537 --> 01:09:54.004
There you go.

01:09:54.006 --> 01:09:55.540
Can I get some red wine,
please?

01:09:55.542 --> 01:09:57.210
- Sure.
- Thanks.

01:09:58.912 --> 01:10:01.146
- Thank you.
- For you, sir?

01:10:01.148 --> 01:10:03.080
Can I actually have a red wine
as well, please?

01:10:03.082 --> 01:10:04.951
- A red wine?
- Yeah, please.

01:10:06.752 --> 01:10:08.088
Thank you.

01:10:10.224 --> 01:10:12.490
Please let me know
if you need anything else.

01:10:12.492 --> 01:10:14.425
Oh, we will.

01:10:14.427 --> 01:10:15.660
Hurry up and drink this shit

01:10:15.662 --> 01:10:16.762
so we can ask her
to come back again.

01:10:16.764 --> 01:10:18.763
Oh, yeah.

01:10:18.765 --> 01:10:22.000
Oh, my God. Look at
the baby soda, Spencer!

01:10:22.002 --> 01:10:24.535
Alek, shut the heck up.

01:10:24.537 --> 01:10:25.839
So cute.

01:10:26.972 --> 01:10:29.409
I'm about to go to sleep.

01:10:31.144 --> 01:10:33.179
Uh, I guess nap time it is.

01:10:34.614 --> 01:10:35.815
Can't hang.

01:12:18.051 --> 01:12:20.221
Get out of here, it's serious.

01:12:23.088 --> 01:12:24.554
I've got the gun.

01:13:08.702 --> 01:13:09.970
Spencer, go!

01:13:36.061 --> 01:13:37.331
Get the gun!

01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:48.242
Holy shit!

01:13:50.577 --> 01:13:52.910
He's got a knife.
Get him off me!

01:13:52.912 --> 01:13:54.113
Shit!

01:14:01.087 --> 01:14:02.519
I got his arm,
I got his arm!

01:14:02.521 --> 01:14:04.522
Stop resisting!

01:14:04.524 --> 01:14:06.057
- Stop resisting.
- Hold him down!

01:14:06.059 --> 01:14:07.392
I got him!

01:14:07.394 --> 01:14:08.559
Shit!

01:14:08.561 --> 01:14:10.297
I can't hold his arm.
Move! Move!

01:14:22.908 --> 01:14:25.110
- Grab his arms!
- Get it, get it!

01:14:25.112 --> 01:14:26.447
There you go!

01:14:32.586 --> 01:14:34.052
Dude,
that's it, that's it!

01:14:34.054 --> 01:14:35.389
You got it! You got it!

01:14:48.001 --> 01:14:51.068
Guys! Guys!
This guy's been shot.

01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:52.370
This guy's bleeding,
he needs help!

01:14:52.372 --> 01:14:54.909
- Hold him down.
- Go, I got him.

01:14:58.144 --> 01:14:59.947
Move, move, move!

01:15:01.014 --> 01:15:02.683
Mark! Mark!

01:15:03.649 --> 01:15:05.317
- Mark! Mark!
- Shit.

01:15:05.319 --> 01:15:07.885
Help him please.
Could you help him, please?

01:15:07.887 --> 01:15:09.655
I got it, I got it.

01:15:09.657 --> 01:15:10.987
Please, help him.

01:15:13.025 --> 01:15:15.160
Can you help him?

01:15:15.162 --> 01:15:16.594
We need something
to tie him up with.

01:15:16.596 --> 01:15:19.130
No, just take him.
Hold him down.

01:15:19.132 --> 01:15:20.799
Okay.

01:15:20.801 --> 01:15:22.268
He's got another one there.

01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:24.371
Look, he's bleeding here, too.

01:15:26.372 --> 01:15:27.571
I got it, I got it.

01:15:27.573 --> 01:15:29.206
You're gonna be
all right, man.

01:15:29.208 --> 01:15:30.107
He's bleeding
from here, too. Look.

01:15:30.109 --> 01:15:31.174
You're good.

01:15:31.176 --> 01:15:32.509
I'm here, man, I'm here.

01:15:32.511 --> 01:15:34.345
Don't worry.
Hey, try not to move, okay?

01:15:34.347 --> 01:15:35.580
You guys got him?

01:15:35.582 --> 01:15:36.982
I'm gonna go
clear the other cars.

01:15:36.984 --> 01:15:39.318
Listen to me,
all right?

01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:40.785
Listen to your wife.
It's okay. See,

01:15:40.787 --> 01:15:42.387
when you move like that,
we can't do that, all right?

01:15:42.389 --> 01:15:43.888
- All right.
- Okay?

01:15:43.890 --> 01:15:46.223
Don't move, Mark,
please. Stay with me.

01:15:46.225 --> 01:15:48.192
If I lose it,
you're gonna die, okay?

01:15:48.194 --> 01:15:49.260
- Okay.
- I know you're hurting,

01:15:49.262 --> 01:15:50.594
but don't move, okay?

01:15:50.596 --> 01:15:53.031
Listen to me. Listen to me.
I love you.

01:15:53.033 --> 01:15:54.300
I love you, too, baby.

01:15:54.302 --> 01:15:55.901
You stay
with me, okay?

01:15:55.903 --> 01:15:57.869
- Hey, Mark? Mark?
- Yeah.

01:15:57.871 --> 01:16:00.472
Hey man,
do you wanna say a prayer?

01:16:00.474 --> 01:16:02.173
- No, thanks.
- No?

01:16:02.175 --> 01:16:03.708
He's not ready to go.

01:16:03.710 --> 01:16:05.712
- Okay.
- He's just not ready to go, okay?

01:16:09.683 --> 01:16:11.382
No, no. It's okay.

01:16:11.384 --> 01:16:13.351
Anybody got a towel?
Anything! Anything!

01:16:13.353 --> 01:16:14.755
It's okay. It's okay.

01:16:21.828 --> 01:16:23.861
No, no, it's okay.

01:16:23.863 --> 01:16:25.862
He's a good guy.
He's helping us.

01:16:25.864 --> 01:16:26.964
Is anybody else hurt?

01:16:26.966 --> 01:16:28.700
No. It's okay. It's okay.

01:16:28.702 --> 01:16:30.401
Tell everybody
just to stay back here.

01:16:30.403 --> 01:16:31.403
Okay.

01:16:43.649 --> 01:16:45.116
Just take the tie. Go on.

01:16:45.118 --> 01:16:46.750
Get it around under his arm.
Under his arms.

01:16:46.752 --> 01:16:49.019
- Ma'am. Ma'am!
- Yeah.

01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:50.187
Okay, I need you
to talk to him.

01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:51.789
Help me keep him awake.
Hey! Hey!

01:16:51.791 --> 01:16:53.959
- What's your name?
- Mark, you're gonna be okay.

01:16:53.961 --> 01:16:55.026
Mark.

01:16:55.028 --> 01:16:56.460
Mark. Hey, I'm Spencer, man.

01:16:56.462 --> 01:16:57.896
Hey, it's gonna be all right.

01:16:57.898 --> 01:17:00.498
We got it. Okay?
I'm cut up a little bit, too.

01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:01.866
You're gonna
be okay.

01:17:01.868 --> 01:17:03.201
It's gonna be
all good. All right?

01:17:03.203 --> 01:17:05.370
We stopped the bleeding.

01:17:05.372 --> 01:17:06.838
Where are you from?

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:08.106
Virginia.

01:17:08.108 --> 01:17:11.107
Virginia. Hey!
I'm from California, man.

01:17:11.109 --> 01:17:13.445
We're both Americans.

01:17:13.447 --> 01:17:14.812
I love you, okay? Don't go.

01:17:14.814 --> 01:17:16.314
You're gonna be
all right, all right?

01:17:16.316 --> 01:17:17.248
We're gonna get some beers
after this.

01:17:17.251 --> 01:17:18.549
It's gonna be all good.

01:17:18.551 --> 01:17:19.584
- Look at how lucky we got.
- Shit.

01:17:19.586 --> 01:17:21.387
It's, like, one in a million.

01:17:22.756 --> 01:17:24.054
Spencer, Spencer.

01:17:24.056 --> 01:17:25.423
Here. I got a sweater
so we can stop the bleeding.

01:17:25.425 --> 01:17:26.825
Can you use this sweater?

01:17:26.827 --> 01:17:28.260
Yeah, that's okay. I got it.

01:17:28.262 --> 01:17:29.727
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

01:17:29.729 --> 01:17:31.562
- Anthony. Anthony.
- Yeah, what do you need?

01:17:31.564 --> 01:17:32.797
I need a med kit or something
to cut his clothes off with.

01:17:32.799 --> 01:17:34.499
Okay. I'll try
and find something.

01:17:34.501 --> 01:17:36.166
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

01:17:36.168 --> 01:17:37.369
They have
to have one.

01:17:37.371 --> 01:17:38.902
Yeah. I got you.
I got you.

01:17:38.904 --> 01:17:40.405
It's gonna be okay.

01:17:40.407 --> 01:17:42.205
Hey, man, I need you
to stay awake, okay?

01:17:42.207 --> 01:17:43.874
Keep your eyes open.
Focus on your wife.

01:17:43.876 --> 01:17:46.443
- Stay with me.
- Come on, man. Hey.

01:17:46.445 --> 01:17:47.911
We're gonna get
to the train station.

01:17:47.913 --> 01:17:49.647
We're gonna get you some help,
okay? You're good.

01:17:49.649 --> 01:17:52.983
Stay with me, please.
Stay with me.

01:17:52.985 --> 01:17:55.652
Okay.

01:17:55.654 --> 01:17:58.759
- Okay? Just stay with me.
- Okay, okay.

01:18:33.527 --> 01:18:36.561
Still bleeding
in the back.

01:18:36.563 --> 01:18:38.094
It's okay. I can't
deal with that right now.

01:18:38.096 --> 01:18:40.464
Hey. That's the guy you want,
right there. He's out.

01:18:40.466 --> 01:18:42.066
Can you hear me?
Did you stop the bleeding?

01:18:42.068 --> 01:18:43.668
Is he the gun shot?

01:18:43.670 --> 01:18:45.035
I know
you're in pain.

01:18:45.037 --> 01:18:46.536
Don't move, okay?
Just don't move.

01:18:46.538 --> 01:18:48.458
There's a guy back there
got shot. He's bleeding.

01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:54.313
You're almost there, man.

01:18:54.315 --> 01:18:55.845
The paramedics are coming.

01:18:55.847 --> 01:18:57.847
You're gonna make it.
They're coming, just hold it.

01:18:58.518 --> 01:19:00.050
Here they come right now.
Just hold it, man.

01:19:00.052 --> 01:19:01.718
You made it, man. Come on.

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:04.556
They're coming, Mark.
They're coming, okay?

01:19:04.558 --> 01:19:05.857
They're gonna
take you to a hospital.

01:19:05.859 --> 01:19:06.991
They're gonna
take care of you, okay?

01:19:06.993 --> 01:19:08.093
Okay.

01:19:08.095 --> 01:19:09.160
They'll take care of you.

01:19:09.162 --> 01:19:10.530
You made it this long.

01:19:16.670 --> 01:19:18.272
They're
right here, Spencer.

01:19:30.082 --> 01:19:31.348
No, no. Stop, stop.

01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:33.017
Okay, look. Come here.

01:19:33.019 --> 01:19:34.286
You see? Okay.

01:19:34.288 --> 01:19:36.255
One, two, three.

01:19:36.257 --> 01:19:37.824
Go, go, go.

01:20:21.466 --> 01:20:23.099
- Hey.
- It's okay?

01:20:23.101 --> 01:20:24.334
- Yeah.
- Feels okay?

01:20:24.336 --> 01:20:25.602
Yeah, yeah.

01:20:25.604 --> 01:20:26.970
Where are we going?

01:20:26.972 --> 01:20:28.839
What are we doing here?

01:20:28.841 --> 01:20:30.309
Walk this way? Okay.

01:21:08.014 --> 01:21:12.083
<i>Lord, make me
an instrument of Your peace.</i>

01:21:12.085 --> 01:21:15.719
<i>Where there is hatred,
let me sow love.</i>

01:21:15.721 --> 01:21:19.123
<i>Where there is injury, pardon.</i>

01:21:19.125 --> 01:21:22.326
<i>Where there is doubt, faith.</i>

01:21:22.328 --> 01:21:26.229
<i>Where there is despair, hope.</i>

01:21:26.231 --> 01:21:29.067
<i>Where there is darkness,
light.</i>

01:21:29.069 --> 01:21:32.402
<i>And where there is sadness,
joy.</i>

01:21:32.404 --> 01:21:34.972
<i>For it is in giving
that we receive.</i>

01:21:34.974 --> 01:21:37.907
<i>It is in pardoning
that we are pardoned.</i>

01:21:37.909 --> 01:21:42.316
<i>And it is in dying that
we are born to eternal life.</i>

01:21:43.049 --> 01:21:44.319
<i>Amen.</i>

01:22:21.386 --> 01:22:22.952
Good afternoon.

01:22:22.954 --> 01:22:23.989

01:22:27.761 --> 01:22:28.929
