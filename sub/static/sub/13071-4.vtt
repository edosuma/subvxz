WEBVTT

00:00.968 --> 00:03.137
* Previously on BrainDead... *

00:03.171 --> 00:04.805
* Gareth and Laurel

00:04.838 --> 00:07.741
* Sittin' in a tree...

00:07.775 --> 00:09.477
* Oh, right,
that meteor that came here *

00:09.510 --> 00:10.578
* From beyond the stars

00:10.611 --> 00:12.513
* D.C. is filled with bugs

00:12.546 --> 00:14.348
* That eat your brains
and dig The Cars *

00:14.382 --> 00:16.084
* They crawl in
through your ear holes *

00:16.117 --> 00:18.252
* Control your thoughts
unless your head explodes *

00:20.254 --> 00:23.324
* Infected people keep infecting
people who are not *

00:23.357 --> 00:25.159
* Gustav is maybe
not a doctor... *

00:25.193 --> 00:26.494
No, but I read a lot.

00:26.527 --> 00:29.130
* A bug was in the CAT scan

00:29.163 --> 00:32.533
* Their sense of calm
and confidence erodes *

00:32.566 --> 00:33.434
* Ella's infected, too

00:33.467 --> 00:35.669
* Apparently,
the bugs want her to *

00:35.703 --> 00:38.806
* Embroil Luke
in a battle for control *

00:38.839 --> 00:40.608
* Abby's views got so extreme

00:40.641 --> 00:42.843
* Since she joined
the space bug team *

00:42.876 --> 00:45.213
* So Laurel knows
these bugs are on a roll *

00:45.246 --> 00:46.714
* A tender moment there

00:46.747 --> 00:48.616
* When Laurel thinks
that Gareth's dead *

00:48.649 --> 00:51.819
* Gustav plays The Cars tapes,
red Solo Cups around his head *

00:51.852 --> 00:55.189
* I've never seen two grown men
share a candy bar like that *

00:55.223 --> 00:57.591
* Have you no sense
of decency? *

00:57.625 --> 01:01.362
* My God, you monsters,
not the cat. *

01:09.337 --> 01:11.339
(keys jingling)

01:12.840 --> 01:14.808
Hey, my neighbor.
Finally. (chuckles)

01:14.842 --> 01:16.410
Yeah, I just moved in.

01:16.444 --> 01:18.612
Uh, Noah.
Uh, Jules.

01:18.646 --> 01:21.582
Well, if you need anything,
just...

01:21.615 --> 01:22.750
Bang on the wall?

01:22.783 --> 01:25.686
And... I'll bang back.
(chuckles)

01:40.768 --> 01:42.770
*

02:06.794 --> 02:08.429
(gasps)

02:19.773 --> 02:22.643
What we need is
another American revolution,

02:22.676 --> 02:24.712
but against the people
who are thwarting the dreams

02:24.745 --> 02:26.614
of the American people,

02:26.647 --> 02:29.650
who are doing everything
they can to put America last.

02:29.683 --> 02:32.420
MONARCH: And so the Republicans
have basically put a bullet

02:32.453 --> 02:34.322
in the head of the U.S. economy.

02:34.355 --> 02:37.958
By refusing to negotiate,
refusing to even talk, they...

02:37.991 --> 02:39.727
MISTY: Who else
but the Democrats have given

02:39.760 --> 02:41.895
health care
to the unproductive takers

02:41.929 --> 02:44.498
in our society at the expense
of the hardworking,

02:44.532 --> 02:48.736
average American middle class
and job creators in our econ...

02:48.769 --> 02:50.504
MONARCH:
...losses so far.

02:50.538 --> 02:52.606
They shaved point-six percent
off economic growth

02:52.640 --> 02:54.575
this quarter alone,
and the yield

02:54.608 --> 02:56.410
on short-term treasury bonds
has risen,

02:56.444 --> 02:59.980
causing global investors
to be extremely unhappy.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.250
(dog barking in distance)

03:03.717 --> 03:05.319
MAN (over radio):
On today's program,

03:05.353 --> 03:07.888
health care and lollipops.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.490
We all remember that moment...

03:09.523 --> 03:11.359
MAN 2 (over other radio):
Liberals hate America!

03:11.392 --> 03:12.793
They side with our enemies!

03:12.826 --> 03:14.895
They're more concerned
with banning soda pop...

03:14.928 --> 03:16.397
MAN:
The fall from the monkey bars...

03:16.430 --> 03:17.531
Could you please turn that down?

03:17.565 --> 03:20.268
(both radio programs continue)

03:20.301 --> 03:21.369
(turns up volume)

03:21.402 --> 03:22.236
MAN 2:
Feminista! Barack Obama!

03:22.270 --> 03:23.937
He's their guy!
(engine revving loudly)

03:23.971 --> 03:26.274
(tires screech)

03:30.844 --> 03:33.414
(man 2 continues shouting)

03:36.484 --> 03:38.752
MAN: And should that
even be a question?

03:38.786 --> 03:39.887
We're going to hear from Lucy...

03:42.055 --> 03:43.957
MAN 2:
...are people not seeing this?!

03:47.628 --> 03:48.762
(loud crash)

03:48.796 --> 03:50.898
(clattering)

03:53.801 --> 03:55.869
Rocky.
LAUREL:
Well, that's not bad.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.905
You look like a Rocky.
Nope.

03:57.938 --> 04:00.541
Rocky from Rocky and Bullwinkle.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.809
(laughing)
Yeah.

04:01.842 --> 04:04.978
Till I was 17,
I had a high-pitched voice.

04:05.012 --> 04:06.947
(high-pitched):
Hey, Bullwinkle!

04:06.980 --> 04:08.682
(both laugh)

04:08.716 --> 04:10.551
All right, what was
your nickname?
Mine?

04:10.584 --> 04:11.519
Yeah.
Oh, no,

04:11.552 --> 04:13.321
I wasn't popular enough
to have a nickname.

04:13.354 --> 04:14.888
See, that can't be true.
Come on.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.624
No, I'm serious.

04:16.657 --> 04:18.959
People thought I was a good
girl, so they called me...

04:18.992 --> 04:20.628
"good girl."

04:20.661 --> 04:22.396
Yeah, it wasn't

04:22.430 --> 04:24.732
a very creative school;
even the bullying was prosaic.

04:24.765 --> 04:25.833
(laughs)

04:25.866 --> 04:28.001
So, um...

04:28.035 --> 04:30.371
I need to ask you
a work question.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.005
Can you put your FBI hat on?

04:32.039 --> 04:33.006
Sure.

04:33.040 --> 04:33.974
Hold on.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.676
Okay, go.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.012
My brother says
that a terrorist group

04:39.046 --> 04:42.583
is responsible for these, um...
head eruptions.

04:42.616 --> 04:43.684
Uh, CHIs.
CHIs.

04:43.717 --> 04:46.019
Right. Is that true?

04:46.053 --> 04:49.523
The Islamic Rayid Front
claims responsibility,

04:49.557 --> 04:51.759
but they take responsibility
for everything.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.994
Actually, we think it's medical.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.663
We've just been given
2-64 powers.

04:55.696 --> 04:58.499
What's that?
U.S. Code 2-64.

04:58.532 --> 05:01.835
We can help the CDC investigate
by taking people into custody

05:01.869 --> 05:02.936
for observation.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.105
Have you heard of the screwworm?

05:05.138 --> 05:06.974
No. What's that?

05:07.007 --> 05:09.009
It's this bug from
Central America.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.978
It burrows into the skull

05:11.011 --> 05:11.979
and...

05:12.012 --> 05:13.847
Makes heads explode?

05:13.881 --> 05:16.116
I know. Look it up on Wikipedia.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.052
It's kind of terrifying. And...

05:24.692 --> 05:26.360
What's wrong?
Nothing.

05:26.394 --> 05:27.928
Just somebody
I know from work.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.463
Who, the Healy girl?

05:29.497 --> 05:30.798
GARETH:
Yeah. You know her?

05:30.831 --> 05:32.132
MISTY:
No. I know the Healys.

05:32.165 --> 05:35.436
Are you slumming with a
Democratic icon, Gareth?

05:35.469 --> 05:37.104
(chuckles)
(chuckles):
Oh, that's so cute.

05:37.137 --> 05:39.973
It's that newscaster, isn't it?

05:40.007 --> 05:41.809
Misty... something?

05:41.842 --> 05:44.011
Yeah. She's awful.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.946
Who's that guy she's with?
He looks familiar.

05:45.979 --> 05:47.781
I don't know.
Probably some lobbyist.

05:47.815 --> 05:50.984
The Healys are always jumping
into bed with somebody.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.387
So who's that? Old boyfriend?

05:53.421 --> 05:55.989
No. Just this Republican
I'm working with.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.625
(snaps fingers)

05:57.658 --> 05:59.126
I know him.
Great!

05:59.159 --> 06:01.061
You want to go sit at his table?

06:01.094 --> 06:03.531
(chuckles)

06:03.564 --> 06:05.599
So, Misty...

06:05.633 --> 06:08.068
have you heard about
this new group, the One Wayers?

06:08.101 --> 06:09.603
Grassroots.
Shrink the government.

06:09.637 --> 06:10.971
No new taxes.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.973
We've received 83 calls
in the last week.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.543
This isn't some ploy?
Get us to report

06:15.576 --> 06:17.778
on something you guys
are just astroturfing?

06:17.811 --> 06:19.447
Would I do that to you?
(chuckles)

06:19.480 --> 06:21.081
Look, all 83 calls
said the same thing:

06:21.114 --> 06:23.116
stay the course
on the government shutdown.

06:23.150 --> 06:25.719
Who leads it?
We don't know.

06:25.753 --> 06:27.755
I thought I'd get
a reporter to look into it.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.990
You let me know
if you see one around.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.792
(laughs)

06:34.094 --> 06:36.129
What do you want?

06:36.163 --> 06:38.131
Martini?
Yeah.

06:38.165 --> 06:40.167
Surprise me.

06:45.539 --> 06:47.575
So, this was subtle.

06:47.608 --> 06:50.578
Bringing your date to the same
bar we were at the other night.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.145
I'm sorry,
were you talking to me?

06:52.179 --> 06:53.981
Look, that guy you're with,
he's an FBI agent,

06:54.014 --> 06:56.083
and you need to
watch out for him.

06:56.116 --> 06:58.452
(laughs quietly)
What?

06:58.486 --> 07:01.522
I'm just saying,
he's not a good guy.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.524
You don't have
to listen to me.

07:03.557 --> 07:05.526
An Old Fashioned
and a light beer, please.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.528
Old Fashioned
and a martini.

07:07.561 --> 07:10.030
People at the FBI used to
call him a "ten center."

07:10.063 --> 07:12.700
You know why?
Just standing here
waiting for my drinks.

07:12.733 --> 07:15.569
It's like that old joke.
There's this elderly couple,

07:15.603 --> 07:16.937
and they find
themselves destitute.

07:16.970 --> 07:17.971
And the wife says,

07:18.005 --> 07:20.574
"Don't vorry, I vill go
out and sell my body."

07:20.608 --> 07:23.176
Are they Eastern European?
So, she's gone all day,

07:23.210 --> 07:25.746
and when she comes back,
she says, "Ve are saved.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.181
I have made 250 dollars
and ten cents."

07:28.215 --> 07:31.118
And the husband says, "Ten
cents? Who gave you ten cents?"

07:31.151 --> 07:33.954
She says, "Everybody."

07:33.987 --> 07:37.190
So my date is like
an Eastern European woman

07:37.224 --> 07:38.191
who sleeps around?

07:38.225 --> 07:39.860
No.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.929
Your date is
like a mercenary

07:41.962 --> 07:43.964
who sells himself to
the lowest bidder.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.868
(sets drink down)

07:47.901 --> 07:50.070
Okay, I'm going now.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.141
What was that all about?

07:54.174 --> 07:57.110
Nothing. He says
he knows you.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.979
ANTHONY:
Really?

08:00.080 --> 08:01.982
Oh, dear Lord.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.119
This night is like a circus.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.220
(exhales)

08:07.254 --> 08:08.822
One second. Just...

08:11.825 --> 08:13.026
Gustav, I'm having a drink.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.194
I've got some bugs.
Okay,

08:14.227 --> 08:15.896
can we talk about it
another time?

08:15.929 --> 08:17.565
And how did you even know
I was here?

08:17.598 --> 08:19.667
I was looking for bugs in my
apartment, and then I saw Zeke,

08:19.700 --> 08:21.268
and he was...
Who's Zeke?
No, don't answer that.

08:21.301 --> 08:23.270
(meows)

08:24.337 --> 08:26.206
Okay, Gustav. Tomorrow.

08:26.239 --> 08:27.975
Your date's leaving anyway--
work needs him.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.277
What?
Laurel, hey,
uh, I just got a text.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.580
I got to go.
Works needs me.

08:33.614 --> 08:34.815
I'm Anthony.

08:34.848 --> 08:35.916
I know.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.252
Okay, uh...
I'll call you later.

08:39.286 --> 08:40.253
All right? Okay.

08:40.287 --> 08:41.288
(phone chimes)
Okay.

08:43.223 --> 08:44.725
Okay, thanks. Laurel had fun.

08:45.759 --> 08:46.860
Okay.

08:46.894 --> 08:49.529
Uh... I'll call you.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.134
Did you text him?

08:54.167 --> 08:56.604
No. How would I know
how to do that?

08:58.071 --> 08:59.272
I just saw he was
getting a text.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.608
That's all.
Gustav...

09:00.641 --> 09:02.275
Look, this is more important.

09:02.309 --> 09:05.278
We have to get Zeke to your
doctor friend for a CAT scan.

09:06.847 --> 09:09.282
ROCHELLE:
Yep, cat CAT scan.

09:09.316 --> 09:12.986
I'm so glad
I went to med school.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.221
The pyriform's intact.
Everything's healthy.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.624
See?
Try the posterior
lateral sulcus.

09:18.726 --> 09:20.060
Try farther up.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.230
ROCHELLE:
Hmm.
There we go.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.297
Your cat moved.
He didn't move.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.667
What? What is it?
There is no
lateral sulcus.

09:26.700 --> 09:27.768
That's not possible.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.569
Try the
suprasplenial gyrus.

09:33.340 --> 09:34.642
It's the screwworms.

09:34.675 --> 09:36.343
They can't do that.
Clearly they did.

09:36.376 --> 09:38.211
How else can
you explain...
It's missing, too?

09:38.245 --> 09:41.048
Cat moved, or the CT...

09:41.081 --> 09:42.616
I don't know.

09:42.650 --> 09:44.051
The bugs ate
half its brain.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.252
That's why people
are changing.

09:45.285 --> 09:46.887
They only have
half their brains.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.656
Can you even live
with half a brain?

09:48.689 --> 09:50.223
(Zeke meows)

09:53.226 --> 09:55.863
LAUREL:
You don't see them, do you?
ROCHELLE: No.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.064
The eardrum's
punctured though.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.198
GUSTAV:
That's how they get in.

09:58.231 --> 10:00.133
The bugs push in
through the eardrum.

10:00.167 --> 10:01.969
Is that true?
I don't know.

10:02.002 --> 10:04.004
All I'm saying is this cat
has a punctured eardrum.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.673
That means
they're deaf in one ear.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.140
That's how we know
who's infected.

10:07.174 --> 10:09.009
We don't know
anything yet.

10:09.042 --> 10:11.278
Uh, perilymph
fluid is missing.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.213
What does that mean?

10:13.246 --> 10:14.748
Inner ear.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.717
A loss of fluid
means...
Balance.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.886
Absence of
perilymph fluid means

10:18.919 --> 10:20.320
that they're off balance.

10:20.353 --> 10:21.755
That's how we know
who's infected.

10:21.789 --> 10:23.991
If they're deaf in one ear
or off balance,

10:24.024 --> 10:25.392
they're probably missing
half their brain.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.999
Ah. Here's Senator
Pollack now.

10:32.032 --> 10:34.001
I asked her to
join us, too.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.669
Mr. Tabak,
Ella Pollack.

10:35.703 --> 10:38.371
I just lost $4 million.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.340
You just lost...?

10:40.373 --> 10:41.975
Eh, uh...

10:43.410 --> 10:45.245
I just lost $4 million more.

10:46.279 --> 10:48.015
Uh, sir, uh,

10:48.048 --> 10:49.750
we're in a complicated
situation.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.919
We're the party
of adults.
(scoffs)

10:51.952 --> 10:53.420
It's the Republicans

10:53.453 --> 10:55.355
who shut down
the government...
I don't care.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.190
Now, I've personally bundled

10:57.224 --> 10:59.026
half a billion dollars
for your party.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.795
Unless this is solved,
that money goes away.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.330
The Republicans are
asking us to cut

11:03.363 --> 11:05.298
three major agencies...
Yes, and you will

11:05.332 --> 11:07.134
slash one
as a show of good faith.

11:08.301 --> 11:09.803
No, we won't.
Yes, you will.

11:09.837 --> 11:11.705
Now, I'm meeting with
the Republicans in an hour,

11:11.739 --> 11:12.973
and I need a compromise.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.808
You have 40 seconds

11:14.842 --> 11:17.377
to name the agency...
You can take your money
and shove it.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.312
Ella, let's-let's
all just...
No.

11:19.346 --> 11:22.349
I'm sick of playing dead
for big money.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.284
See what you think
about a 20% jump

11:24.317 --> 11:26.319
in capital gains tax,
you jackass.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.355
Who is this woman?

11:28.388 --> 11:31.358
I'm the homeless person
knocking at your tinted window.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.293
I'm your daughter
when she sleeps with

11:33.326 --> 11:34.427
the poli-sci professor.

11:34.461 --> 11:35.863
40 seconds, Luke.

11:35.896 --> 11:38.098
National Endowment
for the Arts.

11:43.503 --> 11:45.138
Good.

11:45.172 --> 11:48.375
We'll wrap this up tomorrow.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.410
(choir singing
in foreign language)

11:53.413 --> 11:54.447
(choir continues)

11:54.481 --> 11:56.416
LAUREL (over video):
This music is disappearing,

11:56.449 --> 11:59.019
just as the island itself
is disappearing.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.288
All I need are matching funds.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.463
What are you doing?

12:10.497 --> 12:12.365
I'm cold.

12:12.399 --> 12:16.169
LAUREL: I need $200,000
to further this effort.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.205
Please give generously.

12:20.808 --> 12:23.443
I'm coming.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.312
(video stops)

12:27.547 --> 12:29.482
I'm hearing about these
One Wayers, Senator.

12:29.516 --> 12:31.018
What are they?

12:31.051 --> 12:33.520
Well, Misty,
just in the last week,

12:33.553 --> 12:36.824
we've received literally
hundreds of e-mails and calls

12:36.857 --> 12:39.526
from this group--
people who feel like

12:39.559 --> 12:41.461
they're losing their country,

12:41.494 --> 12:43.864
who feel America
is going to hell,

12:43.897 --> 12:46.299
and, well, they're out
to make it great again.

12:46.333 --> 12:49.302
These brave citizens
want to

12:49.336 --> 12:53.506
lift America out of its downward
spiral towards weakness...

12:53.540 --> 12:55.208
WOMAN (over TV):
As if the presidential campaign

12:55.242 --> 12:56.476
weren't hot enough,
the nation...

12:56.509 --> 12:57.845
Hello. I'm Laurel.

12:57.878 --> 12:59.012
I'm an aide to the senator

12:59.046 --> 13:01.214
specializing
in constituent casework.

13:01.248 --> 13:03.583
You are... Noah Feffer?

13:03.616 --> 13:05.185
Yes. Hello.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.887
That's a nasty cut
you've got there.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.388
I was in a car crash.

13:08.421 --> 13:11.058
I'm sorry. Are you all right?
Yes.

13:11.091 --> 13:13.026
Would you like to sit?
No.

13:13.060 --> 13:15.595
Would you like any water?
No.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.464
Okay.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.499
How may I help you?

13:20.567 --> 13:22.569
I'm angry.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.873
Regarding?

13:25.906 --> 13:27.540
Everything.

13:27.574 --> 13:30.277
The thing is,
the more specific you get...

13:30.310 --> 13:31.478
Income inequality,

13:31.511 --> 13:33.313
childhood diseases, big oil,

13:33.346 --> 13:35.916
your brother cutting the
National Endowment of the Arts.

13:35.949 --> 13:38.318
Why is he doing that?
Well, I think it's more
about reopening

13:38.351 --> 13:39.552
the government...
Oh, no, no.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.154
(door closes)

13:41.188 --> 13:43.957
It is about giving in
to the fascists.

13:43.991 --> 13:45.926
Now, he needs to take the
fight to the Republicans.

13:45.959 --> 13:48.061
When they kill a hostage,
he needs to kill a hostage.

13:48.095 --> 13:49.863
When they hold a knife
to his throat,

13:49.897 --> 13:51.564
he needs to hold a knife
to theirs.

13:51.598 --> 13:54.467
Look at Finland and Denmark--
why can't we be more like them?

13:55.668 --> 13:58.171
Okay. I will tell Senator Healy.
Thank you.

13:58.205 --> 13:59.372
Why aren't you angry?

14:00.373 --> 14:01.875
Why aren't I?

14:01.909 --> 14:03.643
I'm the constituent
caseworker here...

14:03.676 --> 14:06.079
Our country is in mortal danger.
Why can't you see that?

14:06.113 --> 14:08.048
We need a political revolution!

14:08.081 --> 14:10.083
You-you just sit there,
but the One Wayers,

14:10.117 --> 14:11.952
they count on us
being peaceful and calm.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.921
What... You haven't
heard a word I said.

14:13.954 --> 14:16.256
I have. Every word.
Even if I don't sound angry...

14:16.289 --> 14:17.624
Don't patronize me!

14:17.657 --> 14:19.592
Now, they are armed,
because they have the NRA,

14:19.626 --> 14:20.593
so we need to arm ourselves.
Okay.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.963
Thank you, sir.
I'm needed in another meeting.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.965
Oh, that's all you have
to say? This isn't over.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.366
Actually it is.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.970
Good-bye.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.242
*

14:47.087 --> 14:49.089
*

14:58.098 --> 15:00.467
He said what?
He said, "There are other
ways to arm ourselves."

15:00.500 --> 15:02.435
Get the capitol police on it.
I'm fine.

15:02.469 --> 15:04.037
No, he threatened you, Laurel.

15:04.071 --> 15:06.006
Did you call
the capitol police?

15:06.039 --> 15:08.208
Yes. But they're
a little busy.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.643
Then talk to the FBI, and if
they don't get right over here,

15:10.677 --> 15:12.946
get me on the phone
with them.
Luke, stop worrying, okay?

15:12.980 --> 15:14.614
And do you really
want me at this thing?

15:14.647 --> 15:16.383
I want you to talk
to his chief of staff,

15:16.416 --> 15:17.617
see where we're headed.

15:17.650 --> 15:20.020
We need to get the
government back to work.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.488
Uh, Mr. Tabak,
good morning.

15:22.489 --> 15:23.523
(groans softly)

15:23.556 --> 15:25.058
RED:
Ha-ha!

15:25.092 --> 15:26.994
Here we all are!

15:27.027 --> 15:28.728
Shall we settle this today?

15:28.761 --> 15:30.964
I think we shall.

15:32.399 --> 15:33.200
RED:
...already discussed this!

15:33.233 --> 15:35.535
ELLA:
No, we haven't discussed it!

15:35.568 --> 15:37.204
(arguing continues behind door)

15:37.237 --> 15:40.007
(sighs): Well...
this is going well.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.042
Hey, look,
your girlfriend's on TV.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.544
She's not my...

15:44.577 --> 15:46.679
She looks pouty today.
You upset her, Gar?

15:46.713 --> 15:49.182
So how long have you known
your FBI friend?

15:49.216 --> 15:51.184
What happened to her
usual bedroom eyes?

15:51.218 --> 15:53.086
She looks like
she's gonna cry.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.088
Yeah. It's probably
because the Democrats

15:55.122 --> 15:57.057
are bankrupting
our nation.

15:57.090 --> 16:00.260
(laughs quietly)

16:00.293 --> 16:02.729
RED: Look, you already agreed
to cut one department.

16:02.762 --> 16:04.264
Just cut the other two!

16:04.297 --> 16:06.066
See? This is what
we're up against.

16:06.099 --> 16:08.101
And we shouldn't even
be cutting that one!

16:08.135 --> 16:09.636
This isn't just me talking.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.771
No, actually, it is
just you talking.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.773
All right, look,
take this pencil.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.408
Try to break it.

16:15.442 --> 16:16.676
(whimpers mockingly)

16:16.709 --> 16:19.346
Take a whole stack
of pencils. (grunts)

16:19.379 --> 16:22.015
That's how strong we are!

16:23.450 --> 16:25.418
That's how strong I am!
This is the type

16:25.452 --> 16:28.021
of insanity I have to deal with
with the Democrats.

16:28.055 --> 16:30.590
Listen, we have hundreds
of e-mails telling us

16:30.623 --> 16:32.025
to hold the line.

16:32.059 --> 16:33.660
I want... I want to show you.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.295
(door opens)
Gareth.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.997
Do you have the e-mails
from the One Wayers?
Yes, sir.

16:44.404 --> 16:45.372
(door closes)

16:45.405 --> 16:46.673
What?

16:46.706 --> 16:48.175
What?

16:48.208 --> 16:50.610
You have an expression
on your face. What is it?

16:50.643 --> 16:52.011
Nothing.

16:54.081 --> 16:56.783
Did you notice your boss leans
toward the right when he walks?

16:57.784 --> 16:59.552
What?

16:59.586 --> 17:01.521
He leans toward the right.
Oh, is this, like,

17:01.554 --> 17:03.690
a Democratic taunt
that I don't understand?
Does he have trouble

17:03.723 --> 17:06.193
hearing in one ear?
Is he... is he deaf in one ear?

17:06.226 --> 17:08.528
Hey, turn that up.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.797
You're very
stream-of-consciousness.

17:10.830 --> 17:15.135
...in an abundance of caution,
the CDC is recalling

17:15.168 --> 17:18.471
three experimental
blood pressure medications:

17:18.505 --> 17:20.140
Polemitras, Traviscine
and Quinnox.

17:20.173 --> 17:21.608
What are we...?
Shh.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.843
Any combination
of blood pressure medications

17:23.876 --> 17:25.412
can have an adverse

17:25.445 --> 17:27.780
and unanticipated effect
on the body.

17:27.814 --> 17:30.650
If you aren't sure you are
on these medications...

17:30.683 --> 17:32.552
Polemitras, Traviscine
and Quinnox.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.121
Is he right?

17:34.154 --> 17:34.854
No, they're just
covering their ass.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.456
You don't know that.

17:36.489 --> 17:37.724
Your first instinct
is always to suspect...

17:37.757 --> 17:39.159
Did your father use them?

17:39.192 --> 17:41.094
Those medications?

17:41.128 --> 17:42.729
I don't know.

17:42.762 --> 17:45.332
Did he have
high blood pressure?

17:45.365 --> 17:47.134
No.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.136
See? They don't know
what they're talking about.
Okay.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.138
Look, I have a friend
from medical school

17:51.171 --> 17:52.339
who works with the CDC.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.307
I'll call him and
set up a lunch.

17:54.341 --> 17:56.109
And say what?
Screwworms.

17:56.143 --> 17:58.245
No. I'll find out what
they're thinking,

17:58.278 --> 17:59.879
what their evidence is.
And we'll show them ours.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.481
(computer chimes)
"We" won't do anything.

18:01.514 --> 18:02.882
I will. And Laurel.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.484
I think you
should come, too.

18:04.517 --> 18:05.785
Wait, why Laurel
and not me?

18:05.818 --> 18:07.854
ROCHELLE: Because, Gustav, you
have a tendency to get excited.

18:07.887 --> 18:09.889
GUSTAV: People's heads
are exploding.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.691
When are you supposed
to get excited?

18:11.724 --> 18:14.527
ROCHELLE: No one will help us if
we don't make a good impression.

18:14.561 --> 18:16.529
GUSTAV: So what are you
saying? I'm not presentable?

18:16.563 --> 18:18.765
Is that it?
ROCHELLE:
I didn't say that.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.167
But, you know, you
do have a tendency

18:20.200 --> 18:21.501
to come on strong
and weird people out.

18:21.534 --> 18:22.669
GUSTAV: We're living
in weird times.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.704
My behavior is
entirely appropriate.

18:28.375 --> 18:29.609
I'm angry.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.278
We're losing our country.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.613
They're taking it away
bit by bit.
I know.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.515
And that's why Senator Wheatus
needs your help.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.150
He's one of you.

18:37.184 --> 18:38.685
We're just sick of words;
we need action.

18:38.718 --> 18:41.154
It's like the Red Coats
all over again.
Yes.

18:41.188 --> 18:43.923
And that's why Red Wheatus

18:43.956 --> 18:45.925
wants you to form
the One Wayers.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.395
It's a grassroots campaign

18:48.428 --> 18:50.597
created and run by good citizens
like yourselves.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.132
So, if we can meet tomorrow
to discuss...

18:55.602 --> 18:58.805
Would you excuse me?

18:58.838 --> 19:01.174
Okay, look,
I didn't have anything to do

19:01.208 --> 19:02.309
with the negotiations.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.677
They fell apart
on their own.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.946
What's wrong?

19:06.979 --> 19:09.316
Nothing. Just...

19:09.349 --> 19:10.517
Thank you.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.485
Okay.

19:12.519 --> 19:13.686
For what?

19:13.720 --> 19:16.923
$750.10.

19:19.226 --> 19:20.827
That could be from anybody.

19:20.860 --> 19:23.330
Yeah, yeah, well...

19:23.363 --> 19:24.764
thank anybody.

19:29.936 --> 19:32.672
Okay, that's it. I just wanted
to say thank you, so...

19:32.705 --> 19:34.641
Laurel.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.743
You got a second?

19:36.776 --> 19:39.346
GARETH: This shutdown is
getting out of control.

19:39.379 --> 19:41.581
Compromise is
getting even harder.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.283
I agree.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.517
There's someone else
who agrees:

19:44.551 --> 19:46.919
Majority Leader Amarant.

19:46.953 --> 19:49.956
He just was in
a screaming fight...

19:49.989 --> 19:51.758
with my boss.

19:53.726 --> 19:58.231
The Republican leader wants to
compromise with the Democrats.

19:58.265 --> 20:00.533
He's worried that Wall Street's
gonna pull their PAC money,

20:00.567 --> 20:04.537
but he doesn't have enough votes
without your moderates.

20:04.571 --> 20:06.239
I know.

20:06.273 --> 20:08.007
You're wondering
whether you should trust me.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.008
Uh-huh.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.543
(sighs)

20:10.577 --> 20:13.380
Well, I'll leave that to you.

20:13.413 --> 20:14.914
I'm leaving first.

20:17.350 --> 20:18.785
LUKE:
Wait, who told you this?

20:18.818 --> 20:20.853
Is this from
your chief of staff friend?

20:20.887 --> 20:22.922
LAUREL: Use this information
if you want or don't,

20:22.955 --> 20:25.592
but apparently, Amarant got
into a screaming fight

20:25.625 --> 20:26.793
with Red Wheatus.

20:26.826 --> 20:27.994
Why would he undercut

20:28.027 --> 20:29.996
his own boss
by telling you this?

20:30.029 --> 20:31.431
Are you sleeping with him?

20:31.464 --> 20:32.632
Okay, good night, Luke.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.667
(birds fluttering nearby)

20:38.471 --> 20:40.239
Hello?

20:44.577 --> 20:46.913
Gareth?

20:46.946 --> 20:48.948
(footsteps running)

21:03.363 --> 21:04.731
Hey, why aren't
you helping me?

21:04.764 --> 21:06.366
Oh, come on.

21:06.399 --> 21:07.900
You want something,
you come to my work.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.569
You don't
follow me here.

21:09.602 --> 21:10.970
Do you listen to NPR?

21:11.003 --> 21:12.171
All Things Considered?

21:12.204 --> 21:14.807
You really want to let go
of All Things Considered?

21:14.841 --> 21:16.343
We will if we
lose the NEA.

21:16.376 --> 21:17.644
Sir, this is a work matter.

21:17.677 --> 21:20.046
This is not some...
You know what this is?

21:20.079 --> 21:22.048
It's from The Splendid Table,
their pledge drive.

21:22.081 --> 21:23.683
That's what we'll lose:

21:23.716 --> 21:25.352
Big Bird, Ken Burns,
The Splendid Table...

21:25.385 --> 21:26.919
What is that?
It's a rape button.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.988
Sends a GPS signal
to the police.

21:29.021 --> 21:30.390
What are you, insane?
This isn't a rape.

21:30.423 --> 21:31.658
I'm a member of
Men Against Rape.

21:31.691 --> 21:32.859
You're carrying a knife!

21:32.892 --> 21:34.427
It's from
The Splendid Table!

21:34.461 --> 21:35.728
Don't you want to know

21:35.762 --> 21:36.929
whether Reverend Chambers
solves the murder?

21:36.963 --> 21:37.897
I don't know what
you're talking about.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.366
Grantchester on
Masterpiece Theater!

21:39.399 --> 21:40.600
Don't you want to know?!

21:40.633 --> 21:42.402
If we lose the NEA,
we won't!

21:42.435 --> 21:43.503
Go.

21:43.536 --> 21:44.904
Go, now!

21:44.937 --> 21:47.006
We are angry and we
will not be denied.

21:47.039 --> 21:49.709
I don't care!
Go! Seriously, go!

21:49.742 --> 21:51.678
(chuckles): Oh, you
know what you are?

21:51.711 --> 21:54.581
I know who I am, and I don't
give a damn what you think I am.

21:54.614 --> 21:57.584
You're an obstructionist!

21:57.617 --> 21:59.085
Masterpiece Theater!

21:59.118 --> 22:00.353
This Old House!

22:00.387 --> 22:01.354
NOVA!

22:01.388 --> 22:02.955
Antiques Roadshow!

22:02.989 --> 22:04.457
Charlie Rose!

22:04.491 --> 22:05.725
Tavis Smiley!

22:15.535 --> 22:17.470
Don't look so nervous,
Senator.

22:17.504 --> 22:19.906
Oh, I feel like
I'm in a spy novel.

22:19.939 --> 22:21.741
If my caucus knew I
was meeting with you,

22:21.774 --> 22:23.109
they would tar
and feather me.

22:23.142 --> 22:24.577
Same here.

22:24.611 --> 22:28.415
So, I heard you had
a screaming match with Red.

22:28.448 --> 22:29.882
Times are changing.

22:29.916 --> 22:31.651
Extremists used to
make more sense.

22:31.684 --> 22:34.421
Now they don't care if we
throw away the presidency,

22:34.454 --> 22:36.589
they don't care if we
lose our PAC money.

22:36.623 --> 22:38.124
It's insane.

22:38.157 --> 22:39.892
So you want to end this,
I want to end this.

22:39.926 --> 22:40.927
How do we do it?

22:40.960 --> 22:42.595
Well, I have
31 moderates,

22:42.629 --> 22:44.464
but they won't
vote with you.

22:44.497 --> 22:46.633
Uh, there's this group,
the One Wayers--

22:46.666 --> 22:48.000
they're making
our life hell.

22:48.034 --> 22:50.136
If one of us even nods
when a Democrat speaks,

22:50.169 --> 22:51.604
we'll lose our seat.

22:51.638 --> 22:54.807
Well, how about
we kick it down the road?

22:56.676 --> 22:57.977
Sequestration?

22:58.010 --> 22:59.446
Yes.

22:59.479 --> 23:00.947
Agree to across-the-board
budget cuts.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.815
Ten percent military,
ten percent transportation...

23:02.849 --> 23:05.585
Ten percent health?
Right.

23:05.618 --> 23:07.620
Now, they only go
into effect in six months

23:07.654 --> 23:09.656
if we don't reach
a budget agreement.

23:11.724 --> 23:14.561
Yeah, I think I can
hold my 31 with that.

23:14.594 --> 23:16.763
But that still doesn't
help us with Red.

23:16.796 --> 23:19.098
When he gets on the floor,
nobody can hold their ground.

23:19.131 --> 23:20.900
Yeah, I have
the same problem with Ella.

23:20.933 --> 23:23.603
I'll find some way
to sideline them.

23:23.636 --> 23:26.105
All right, let's
see what we can do.

23:31.578 --> 23:33.112
What are you looking for?

23:33.145 --> 23:36.583
Uh, a constituent who was here
yesterday-- Noah something.

23:36.616 --> 23:37.950
He had a cut on his head.

23:37.984 --> 23:39.786
What happened to
yesterday's names?

23:39.819 --> 23:40.853
I cleared them out.

23:40.887 --> 23:43.690
Why would you do that?

23:43.723 --> 23:45.758
New policy.

23:45.792 --> 23:48.127
Destroying yesterday's names.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.096
You have some guests here.

23:55.968 --> 23:57.136
That's not the...

23:59.005 --> 24:01.808
I wasn't going to say
anything weird.

24:03.910 --> 24:05.444
Something's odd, huh?

24:08.247 --> 24:10.216
Yes.
Dex, you're with
the CDC.

24:10.249 --> 24:11.684
You have to stop saying

24:11.718 --> 24:13.486
these explosions are from
prescription medication.

24:13.520 --> 24:14.721
We're not saying that.

24:14.754 --> 24:15.955
We're saying that
we're looking into it.

24:15.988 --> 24:18.758
I took all the pills
14 hours ago-- nothing.

24:18.791 --> 24:19.759
What?

24:19.792 --> 24:21.227
I wanted to make sure

24:21.260 --> 24:22.962
they wouldn't
make my head explode.

24:22.995 --> 24:24.664
LAUREL: Gustav, you
can't just perform

24:24.697 --> 24:25.898
experiments on yourself.

24:25.932 --> 24:27.500
Why aren't these dots
just artifacts

24:27.534 --> 24:28.701
from a malfunctioning
CT scan?

24:28.735 --> 24:30.136
GUSTAV: Because of
the mandible there.

24:30.169 --> 24:31.571
See?

24:31.604 --> 24:33.606
Why isn't that
just a dust mite?

24:33.640 --> 24:35.775
Because it's not.
Look, I'm on your side.

24:35.808 --> 24:38.177
I think we're covering
our ass at the CDC.

24:38.210 --> 24:40.079
But I have to have more than
this. You think it's what?

24:40.112 --> 24:42.815
Cochliomyia hominivorax.

24:45.184 --> 24:47.820
I did my thesis
on screwworm eradication.

24:47.854 --> 24:49.722
You really think they're back?

24:49.756 --> 24:51.591
I think there are bugs

24:51.624 --> 24:53.526
eating through human eardrums,
embedding themselves in brains,

24:53.560 --> 24:54.894
and either changing
people's personalities

24:54.927 --> 24:57.263
or making their
heads explode.

24:57.296 --> 24:59.632
That's just one theory,
of course.

24:59.666 --> 25:01.067
I'm sorry.

25:01.100 --> 25:02.602
I love this stuff.

25:02.635 --> 25:03.703
Me, too.

25:03.736 --> 25:05.805
What is your name again?

25:05.838 --> 25:06.639
Gustav.

25:06.673 --> 25:07.874
Dexter Wu.

25:07.907 --> 25:09.642
It's really
a disgusting bug.

25:09.676 --> 25:11.678
I know.
But it usually only
infects livestock.

25:11.711 --> 25:13.012
Well, global warming
has changed that equation,

25:13.045 --> 25:15.014
don't you think?

25:15.047 --> 25:17.183
Okay, this is what
I suggest, Gustav.

25:17.216 --> 25:19.018
I'll take these CAT
scans to my boss,

25:19.051 --> 25:20.853
and he'll dismiss
them right off hand.

25:20.887 --> 25:23.189
But he'll need to see
a human who is infected.

25:23.222 --> 25:24.657
A human?

25:24.691 --> 25:25.925
Yes.

25:25.958 --> 25:27.860
Do you know of any?

25:31.931 --> 25:33.900
Surprise!

25:33.933 --> 25:35.134
In other campaign news,

25:35.167 --> 25:37.737
civility is once again
off the table.

25:37.770 --> 25:39.205
Nice apartment.
Thanks.

25:39.238 --> 25:41.841
You know, all lives matter.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.910
Not just black lives.

25:44.944 --> 25:46.646
Okay.

25:46.679 --> 25:48.214
Um, Abby...

25:48.247 --> 25:52.652
this is gonna sound strange,
but just keep an open mind.

25:52.685 --> 25:53.920
Rochelle is a doctor.

25:53.953 --> 25:55.888
ROCHELLE: At Mt. Vernon
Memorial Hospital.

25:55.922 --> 25:58.591
And I'm helping her track
a new kind of infection

25:58.625 --> 26:01.127
in the D.C. area--
it's like Lyme disease.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.962
We don't know
how serious.

26:02.995 --> 26:05.798
But we're worried you
may have contracted it.

26:05.832 --> 26:07.366
ROCHELLE:
It comes with loss of balance

26:07.399 --> 26:08.400
and deafness in one ear.

26:08.434 --> 26:10.803
LAUREL: Have you noticed
a change in your hearing?

26:10.837 --> 26:13.172
You're really jealous of
my success, aren't you, Laurel?

26:14.306 --> 26:16.108
No, I'm-I'm just concerned

26:16.142 --> 26:16.909
for your welfare.

26:16.943 --> 26:18.678
Well, thank you
for your concern,

26:18.711 --> 26:20.212
but I'm not sick.

26:20.246 --> 26:21.881
I'm doing well.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.750
Many people
are asymptomatic.

26:23.783 --> 26:26.085
If you don't mind,
I'd like to do a quick,

26:26.118 --> 26:27.620
easy, noninvasive test...

26:27.654 --> 26:29.121
So this is the nanny state now?

26:29.155 --> 26:32.324
Uninvited
house calls?

26:32.358 --> 26:34.260
No.

26:34.293 --> 26:35.795
We're just here
because I'm a friend

26:35.828 --> 26:37.797
and-and I saw these symptoms...

26:37.830 --> 26:38.998
It takes a village.

26:39.031 --> 26:42.268
Huh?

26:42.301 --> 26:45.772
Thanks for dropping by, Laurel.

26:45.805 --> 26:48.274
It's always good to see you.

26:49.876 --> 26:52.011
Well, that wasn't good.

26:52.044 --> 26:53.680
No.

26:53.713 --> 26:55.848
There might be
another way.

27:08.961 --> 27:11.864
ROCHELLE: It's clearly unrelated
to the blood pressure meds.

27:11.898 --> 27:14.867
It's probably a parasite like
spirometra erinaceieuropaei

27:14.901 --> 27:16.869
or naegleria fowleri.

27:16.903 --> 27:18.805
And those are?

27:18.838 --> 27:22.174
Think of them as a deadly
type of Lyme disease

27:22.208 --> 27:23.442
that attacks the brain.

27:23.475 --> 27:24.911
The reason
we called you, Anthony,

27:24.944 --> 27:26.946
is-is you have
that power that, um...

27:26.979 --> 27:27.947
2-64.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.448
Right. And this is someone

27:29.481 --> 27:32.018
who's resisting custody
for observation.

27:32.051 --> 27:34.987
CDC could really benefit
from investigating.

27:35.021 --> 27:36.923
(chuckles)

27:36.956 --> 27:39.258
You know, I, uh...
I looked up screwworms.

27:39.291 --> 27:40.259
Pretty disgusting.

27:40.292 --> 27:41.293
I know, huh?

27:41.327 --> 27:42.962
And, uh,
this woman, uh...

27:42.995 --> 27:45.031
Abby-- she's a friend of mine.

27:45.064 --> 27:46.866
And she's shown signs
of being infected,

27:46.899 --> 27:48.768
but she's resisted help.

27:48.801 --> 27:51.871
So we need you to help
bring her in for a CAT scan.

27:51.904 --> 27:53.305
Is she in pain?

27:53.339 --> 27:54.907
Mm.
No.

27:54.941 --> 27:55.942
Incoherent?

27:55.975 --> 27:59.445
No, but... she's changed.

27:59.478 --> 28:01.680
And she's shown
some of the symptoms.

28:05.484 --> 28:07.253
I'll be right back.

28:09.255 --> 28:10.823
What's going on?

28:10.857 --> 28:12.191
Oh, hey, I didn't want to...

28:12.224 --> 28:13.860
Just thought
I'd leave this with you.

28:13.893 --> 28:15.161
What is it?

28:15.194 --> 28:17.363
It's just information on...

28:17.396 --> 28:19.165
Information on...?

28:19.198 --> 28:21.167
Don't worry about it.
I'll get it to you later.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.002
Hey, uh, Laurel,
I'm gonna head out,

28:23.035 --> 28:24.303
but I'll take
care of this.

28:24.336 --> 28:26.172
Good. Thanks.

28:26.205 --> 28:28.007
Right. Hi.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.375
Hey.

28:29.408 --> 28:31.510
Right. You two
don't know each other.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.479
Um, Anthony,
this is Gareth.

28:33.512 --> 28:34.947
ANTHONY:
Nice to meet you.

28:34.981 --> 28:36.082
You, too.

28:36.115 --> 28:38.084
So, anyway...

28:38.117 --> 28:40.486
Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm heading
over there in an hour.

28:40.519 --> 28:41.921
Good.

28:41.954 --> 28:43.489
Sorry, headed where?

28:43.522 --> 28:44.757
Your friend's place.

28:44.791 --> 28:46.158
Right. Good. Thanks.

28:46.192 --> 28:48.160
Nice to meet
you, Gareth.

28:48.194 --> 28:49.361
You, too, Tony.

28:49.395 --> 28:51.397
Anthony.

28:55.101 --> 28:56.068
Nice guy.

28:56.102 --> 28:56.969
Shut up.

28:57.003 --> 28:58.838
Hey, are you gonna
leave that or what?

29:03.109 --> 29:04.276
Sure.

29:04.310 --> 29:05.311
No rush.

29:05.344 --> 29:08.080
Just... read it when you can.

29:11.884 --> 29:13.085
ANTHONY:
Ms. Summers, hi.

29:13.119 --> 29:15.855
Uh, I'm Agent Onofrio,
FBI Criminal Division.

29:15.888 --> 29:18.157
I'm investigating the
recent outbreak of CHIs.

29:18.190 --> 29:20.192
Uh, I don't know if you've been
following that in the news.

29:20.226 --> 29:21.427
Have I done something wrong?

29:21.460 --> 29:23.329
No, not at all.

29:23.362 --> 29:25.464
Uh, we've been
following an outbreak

29:25.497 --> 29:27.033
of a parasite infestation.

29:27.066 --> 29:29.135
We have reason to
believe you can help us.

29:29.168 --> 29:32.071
We ask that you let
the CDC conduct a quick,

29:32.104 --> 29:33.906
completely painless scan.

29:33.940 --> 29:34.974
It's really for
your own safety.

29:35.007 --> 29:36.342
Are you arresting me?

29:36.375 --> 29:38.845
No.

29:38.878 --> 29:40.346
But we have the power to impel.

29:40.379 --> 29:41.547
We're just worried

29:41.580 --> 29:43.215
that, untreated,
this condition can

29:43.249 --> 29:45.451
result in serious
injury, even death.

29:45.484 --> 29:46.986
It'll only take
15 minutes.

29:47.019 --> 29:48.354
What if I say no?

29:50.122 --> 29:52.191
Then I will have to impel
your cooperation.

29:52.224 --> 29:54.994
You're doing this for Laurel,
aren't you?

29:55.027 --> 29:57.229
No, I'm doing it for the safety
of the populace.

29:57.263 --> 29:58.998
Please, come with me.

29:59.031 --> 30:01.200
I'm gonna get my phone
and my jacket, okay?

30:02.368 --> 30:04.904
I'm gonna record
every step of this.

30:04.937 --> 30:06.238
Please do, ma'am.

30:06.272 --> 30:09.275
We welcome an
engaged citizenry.

30:10.910 --> 30:12.178
(body thuds)

30:12.211 --> 30:14.246
(woman screams)

30:14.280 --> 30:15.514
MAN:
Call for help!

30:15.547 --> 30:17.183
WOMAN:
Help! Someone help!

30:33.299 --> 30:34.233
We bought a domain name,

30:34.266 --> 30:36.268
and we'll be up and running
in a few hours.

30:36.302 --> 30:38.404
Great. And you'll lay out
the One Way philosophy there?

30:38.437 --> 30:40.406
Yes. Tom's writing
the manifesto.

30:40.439 --> 30:42.441
Do you want to see it?
No, the less we
coordinate the better.

30:42.474 --> 30:43.876
What else?

30:43.910 --> 30:45.277
JULES: We'll have columns,
blogs, comments

30:45.311 --> 30:48.414
and various instructive links
to bomb manufacturing

30:48.447 --> 30:50.616
or how to alter bullets
for better expansion.

30:50.649 --> 30:53.419
But also there will be a sign-up
sheet for further actions.

30:53.452 --> 30:55.121
I... W-Wait. What?

30:55.154 --> 30:56.255
We'll have a sign-up sheet
for further actions.

30:56.288 --> 30:59.158
No, no, uh, before that,
you said something about links?

30:59.191 --> 31:01.427
Yes. On the Web site,
to bomb-making materials.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.295
It's stuff you can
find online now,

31:03.329 --> 31:05.264
but it's good to resource
it all in one place.

31:05.297 --> 31:08.234
Why do you need links
to bomb-making materials?

31:08.267 --> 31:10.202
For the people who don't know
how to make them.

31:10.236 --> 31:11.603
It's all legal.

31:11.637 --> 31:15.274
Why do we... need bombs?

31:20.980 --> 31:22.248
To defend our country.

31:22.281 --> 31:23.515
From who?

31:23.549 --> 31:26.152
"Whom."
Whom.

31:26.185 --> 31:27.153
JULES:
Democrats.

31:27.186 --> 31:28.320
Socialists.

31:28.354 --> 31:29.455
Tax-and-spenders.

31:29.488 --> 31:31.223
Yeah, but you can't kill them.

31:31.257 --> 31:33.359
What do you mean?

31:33.392 --> 31:36.362
I mean you can't kill them.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.230
How do we stop them, then?

31:38.264 --> 31:40.299
It's another revolution.
Red said so.

31:40.332 --> 31:42.534
Yeah, but he didn't say,
"Pick up a musket and fight."

31:42.568 --> 31:43.936
Right, because
we have Glocks.

31:43.970 --> 31:45.972
You can't do this.

31:46.005 --> 31:47.373
Seriously, guys.

31:47.406 --> 31:48.941
With all due respect,

31:48.975 --> 31:51.043
you said we can't coordinate.

31:53.045 --> 31:54.413
Yeah, I did say that, but...

31:54.446 --> 31:57.083
Are you serious with this crap?

31:57.116 --> 31:58.550
Laurel, you know, it's, uh...
You leave this with me,

31:58.584 --> 32:00.252
and then you run away
like a little baby.

32:00.286 --> 32:01.988
Okay, can we just
step outside?

32:02.021 --> 32:04.123
Here, let's step outside.

32:04.156 --> 32:06.225
Stay here.

32:08.594 --> 32:10.362
Just stay out of my life.

32:10.396 --> 32:12.264
Okay, don't be throwing bombs
into my life.

32:12.298 --> 32:13.365
I just thought
you should know.

32:13.399 --> 32:15.701
Know what?
Half the report was redacted.

32:15.734 --> 32:16.902
I'm not talking about
the redactions.

32:16.935 --> 32:20.372
I'm talking about the photo
of Onofrio... waterboarding.

32:20.406 --> 32:22.174
It wasn't him.

32:22.208 --> 32:23.675
It looked nothing like him.
Just stop.

32:23.709 --> 32:26.178
Okay, if you think
you're helping me, you're not.

32:26.212 --> 32:28.247
Okay, if you want
to ignore the facts.
They're not facts.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.349
Well...
Just shh. Stop.

32:30.382 --> 32:33.119
(ringtone playing)

32:33.152 --> 32:34.520
Hello.

32:34.553 --> 32:36.355
Anthony, hi.
(groans)

32:36.388 --> 32:39.391
How'd it go?

32:39.425 --> 32:40.592
What-what problem?

32:40.626 --> 32:43.262
What?

32:49.301 --> 32:51.270
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

32:51.303 --> 32:53.305
*

33:02.081 --> 33:04.016
(sniffling)

33:06.085 --> 33:08.254
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

33:08.287 --> 33:10.289
(crying softly)

33:16.495 --> 33:18.464
ANTHONY:
It had nothing to do with us.

33:18.497 --> 33:21.233
But you came here
to take her?

33:21.267 --> 33:23.702
Yeah, but she was depressed.

33:23.735 --> 33:25.704
There were a lot
of changes in her life.

33:25.737 --> 33:27.206
How do you know?

33:27.239 --> 33:28.440
Her friend said.

33:28.474 --> 33:29.675
What friend?

33:31.677 --> 33:33.445
Stacie Zara.

33:39.751 --> 33:41.720
(classical music playing)

33:41.753 --> 33:44.723
(Red and Ella arguing over TV)

33:44.756 --> 33:46.425
Hey, let's get
this moving.

33:46.458 --> 33:47.626
This interview
will last 20 minutes.

33:47.659 --> 33:49.061
You have your 30 votes?

33:49.095 --> 33:50.529
Close by. Your 31?

33:50.562 --> 33:51.530
Close enough.

33:51.563 --> 33:53.832
Here goes. Career suicide.

33:53.865 --> 33:55.401
It's for the country.
Jim, ready?

33:55.434 --> 33:56.402
Hmm? Yes.

33:56.435 --> 33:57.569
All right, let's go.

33:57.603 --> 33:58.737
Senate's in session.
Now, Senator?

33:58.770 --> 34:01.340
There's no one here.
We are.

34:01.373 --> 34:02.641
RED: Yeah, that's right,
play the race card,

34:02.674 --> 34:04.076
'cause that's
what you people do.

34:04.110 --> 34:05.444
ELLA:
"You people"?

34:05.477 --> 34:06.478
"You people."

34:06.512 --> 34:07.813
Do you see how these phrases

34:07.846 --> 34:09.815
flow so naturally
from Senator Wheatus's lips?

34:09.848 --> 34:11.817
RED: Honey, you don't have
to worry about my lips,

34:11.850 --> 34:13.819
'cause they're never getting
near you, I can promise you.

34:13.852 --> 34:15.321
ELLA:
Don't try to cheer me up.

34:15.354 --> 34:16.355
Senate is back in session.

34:16.388 --> 34:18.724
The chair recognizes
the senator from Maryland.

34:18.757 --> 34:20.492
I move for unanimous
consent vote.

34:22.161 --> 34:23.595
Uh, there's only
three people here.

34:23.629 --> 34:26.632
You only need three
for a unanimous consent vote.

34:26.665 --> 34:28.267
You're kidding?
No, check the Senate rules.

34:28.300 --> 34:29.401
LUKE: I move that the
sequestration bill

34:29.435 --> 34:30.836
to reopen the government

34:30.869 --> 34:33.205
be approved
without debate or amendment.

34:33.239 --> 34:34.540
Any objections?

34:36.508 --> 34:38.277
With no objections,
all those in favor

34:38.310 --> 34:40.312
of calling a vote,
please signify by saying, "Aye."

34:40.346 --> 34:41.313
Aye.

34:41.347 --> 34:42.514
Aye.

34:43.849 --> 34:45.284
Nay.

34:45.317 --> 34:46.518
No, "aye."

34:46.552 --> 34:47.586
Aye.

34:47.619 --> 34:50.389
AMARANT:
All those opposed? Thank you.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.858
The unanimous consent bill
passes with no nays.

34:52.891 --> 34:54.860
The sequestration bill
is now ready for a vote.

34:54.893 --> 34:56.495
LUKE:
Chair.

34:56.528 --> 34:58.130
The senator from Maryland
is recognized.

34:58.164 --> 34:59.665
I move that the minimum
15-minute roll call

34:59.698 --> 35:00.666
be applied to the vote.

35:00.699 --> 35:02.534
Do I have a second?

35:02.568 --> 35:03.502
Second.

35:03.535 --> 35:05.471
All those in favor
of the 15-minute time limit.

35:05.504 --> 35:06.372
Aye.

35:06.405 --> 35:07.706
Aye.
JIM: Aye.

35:07.739 --> 35:09.475
LUKE: Call the question.
AMARANT: Second.

35:09.508 --> 35:12.211
RED (over TV): I did not
seek them out; they came to me.

35:12.244 --> 35:14.480
And these folks
are patriotic Americans

35:14.513 --> 35:16.915
from all over the country
who came to Washington

35:16.948 --> 35:18.517
to let their voices be heard.

35:18.550 --> 35:20.286
ELLA:
Same with the No Wayers.

35:20.319 --> 35:22.921
They've heard
what the One Wayers have said,

35:22.954 --> 35:24.890
and believe me,

35:24.923 --> 35:27.259
the No Wayers don't exist
in a vacuum.

35:27.293 --> 35:29.461
SERGEANT AT ARMS:
Bill 112-28 will be...

35:29.495 --> 35:32.464
MAN (over P.A.): All senators
are needed on the floor to vote.

35:32.498 --> 35:34.900
All senators are needed
on the floor to vote.

35:34.933 --> 35:36.568
...Senator Wheatus's One Wayers.

35:36.602 --> 35:38.270
RED: They're not
my One Wayers.

35:38.304 --> 35:40.206
Where is she
getting this?

35:41.473 --> 35:43.509
MISTY: Is there something
you'd like to add, Senator?

35:43.542 --> 35:47.179
Uh, yes, um,
unfortunately,

35:47.213 --> 35:50.482
there is a vote
that I'm needed at.

35:50.516 --> 35:52.718
Uh...

35:52.751 --> 35:55.654
Well, why don't we break away
for a second,

35:55.687 --> 35:57.223
and we'll be right back.

35:59.925 --> 36:02.261
(whistles)

36:02.294 --> 36:03.795
SERGEANT AT ARMS:
Senator Calastana.

36:03.829 --> 36:06.598
Senator Landers.

36:06.632 --> 36:07.733
Senator Charles Lane.

36:07.766 --> 36:08.767
Senator...

36:13.004 --> 36:14.273
RED:
No!

36:14.306 --> 36:15.707
What?
I have to get
on the subway.

36:17.376 --> 36:18.644
ELLA:
Oh, come on!

36:18.677 --> 36:20.412
(groans)

36:23.782 --> 36:26.752
SERGEANT AT ARMS:
Senator Wicker.

36:26.785 --> 36:29.555
With 53 yeas and 23 nays,

36:29.588 --> 36:32.724
bill 112-28... passes.

36:32.758 --> 36:34.760
(applause, excited chatter)

36:37.696 --> 36:39.465
(door opens)

36:41.933 --> 36:44.770
Red, how good to see you.

36:44.803 --> 36:46.872
How was your 15 minutes
of fame?

36:46.905 --> 36:49.475
You're dead.

36:49.508 --> 36:52.944
Hey, come at me.
I'm ready.

36:52.978 --> 36:55.981
No, seriously.

36:57.616 --> 36:58.717
You're dead.

37:08.294 --> 37:09.995
ROCHELLE:
I'm really sorry.

37:11.997 --> 37:13.765
Do you think this is
the infection?

37:13.799 --> 37:16.435
That made her do it?

37:16.468 --> 37:18.504
I don't know.

37:18.537 --> 37:21.273
That's no infection I know of.

37:21.307 --> 37:22.841
She didn't want
a CAT scan,

37:22.874 --> 37:24.776
so she jumped
out of a window.

37:24.810 --> 37:27.646
And the police report says
that she dove headfirst,

37:27.679 --> 37:29.281
so there wouldn't be
enough evidence.

37:29.315 --> 37:30.882
She was depressed, Laurel.

37:30.916 --> 37:32.618
No, Stacie said
she was depressed,

37:32.651 --> 37:34.353
but what if Stacie
is infected, too?

37:34.386 --> 37:37.656
Well, that suggests
some coordination

37:37.689 --> 37:39.691
between infected people.

37:41.693 --> 37:42.961
That makes no sense.

37:45.997 --> 37:46.965
(sighs)

37:46.998 --> 37:48.600
Am I getting paranoid?

37:48.634 --> 37:50.936
I don't know.

37:50.969 --> 37:54.806
When someone close to you dies,
you look for reasons.

37:56.975 --> 37:59.678
Oh, hey, congratulations.

37:59.711 --> 38:00.912
On what?

38:00.946 --> 38:02.781
I heard your brother
opened the government again.

38:02.814 --> 38:04.450
(knock at door)
Oh.

38:04.483 --> 38:06.518
I'm so self-involved,
I didn't even know.

38:06.552 --> 38:07.753
(laughs)
That's great.

38:07.786 --> 38:08.820
Yeah.

38:09.821 --> 38:11.423
Anthony.

38:11.457 --> 38:12.924
Hi.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.527
Hi. Uh, sorry.

38:15.561 --> 38:16.895
I didn't know you had a guest.

38:16.928 --> 38:18.897
Actually, um, I'm heading out.

38:18.930 --> 38:21.066
Don't. I just wanted to see
how you were doing.

38:21.099 --> 38:23.602
I got to head home anyway.

38:24.970 --> 38:26.938
Good night, Laurel.

38:28.674 --> 38:30.542
We'll be good.

38:30.576 --> 38:32.043
We will.

38:32.077 --> 38:34.946
Thanks.

38:34.980 --> 38:36.815
Uh, here.

38:36.848 --> 38:39.385
I got you cookies.

38:39.418 --> 38:40.486
I don't know why.

38:40.519 --> 38:41.887
Cookies are good.

38:41.920 --> 38:44.022
I just... I feel
bad about today.

38:44.055 --> 38:45.891
I know.

38:45.924 --> 38:47.025
You want one?

38:47.058 --> 38:48.093
No.

38:50.896 --> 38:52.431
Sure.

38:54.500 --> 38:55.734
What about you?

38:55.767 --> 38:57.035
No.

38:57.068 --> 38:58.970
A drink maybe.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.879
So I saw the Senate
torture report today.

39:07.913 --> 39:09.815
Somebody gave it to me.

39:09.848 --> 39:12.884
Yeah?

39:12.918 --> 39:14.920
Think you're in it.

39:14.953 --> 39:16.755
I am.

39:16.788 --> 39:19.491
So you were in Iraq?

39:19.525 --> 39:21.527
Yeah.

39:21.560 --> 39:24.930
And you did those
things to people?

39:24.963 --> 39:27.733
What things?

39:27.766 --> 39:29.501
Enhanced interrogation.

39:29.535 --> 39:32.871
Waterboarding.

39:32.904 --> 39:34.573
Is that what you think?

39:34.606 --> 39:35.974
I don't know
what I think.

39:36.007 --> 39:39.778
I just want to know
what's true.

39:39.811 --> 39:43.081
What's true is
I was a whistleblower.

39:43.114 --> 39:46.084
I'm only in the report
'cause I named names.

39:48.787 --> 39:49.888
Nothing more?

39:49.921 --> 39:51.457
Nothing more.

39:51.490 --> 39:53.925
There's this rumor
that I was a mercenary,

39:53.959 --> 39:56.762
that I tortured,
but it's not true.

40:00.999 --> 40:03.635
I'm sorry.

40:03.669 --> 40:05.704
For?

40:05.737 --> 40:07.739
For thinking
the opposite.

40:15.146 --> 40:16.948
Sorry.

40:16.982 --> 40:20.752
I, um... I've been wanting
to do that for a week now.

40:20.786 --> 40:22.554
Don't apologize.

40:22.588 --> 40:24.222
Have you noticed we
both apologize a lot?

40:24.255 --> 40:25.891
I know.
Yeah.

40:25.924 --> 40:27.859
Let's stop.

40:31.930 --> 40:32.998
Go to hell.

40:33.031 --> 40:34.032
Eat crap.

40:34.065 --> 40:36.702
(chuckles)

40:55.186 --> 40:57.989
In a wild night of
secret voting, the so-called

40:58.023 --> 40:59.090
(lowers volume):
Moderate Rebellion

40:59.124 --> 41:01.259
passed a sequestration bill

41:01.292 --> 41:04.095
that kept the government open,
at least temporarily.

41:04.129 --> 41:05.731
Well, I don't mean to brag,

41:05.764 --> 41:08.667
but this was statesmanship
at its best.

41:08.700 --> 41:11.069
I'm very proud of my colleagues
on both sides

41:11.102 --> 41:13.238
of the aisle who voted
for sequestration.

41:13.271 --> 41:15.040
Now our job will be
to work toward...

41:15.073 --> 41:17.075
(phone vibrating)

41:18.944 --> 41:21.046
Yeah, I'm pretty bitchin'.

41:21.079 --> 41:23.114
You are, I won't deny it.

41:23.148 --> 41:24.950
Mm, it was so sweet.

41:24.983 --> 41:26.952
Red didn't know what hit him.

41:26.985 --> 41:28.954
The memory's gonna
have to last for a while

41:28.987 --> 41:31.222
because we're heading
into an ugly time.

41:31.256 --> 41:32.724
Why?

41:32.758 --> 41:34.125
What, you didn't see
Red and Ella?

41:34.159 --> 41:35.727
No, what?
(Luke chuckles)

41:35.761 --> 41:38.063
It's best to avert your eyes.

41:38.096 --> 41:40.165
Uh, their sound bites...

41:40.198 --> 41:41.166
(sighs)

41:41.199 --> 41:42.634
I'll see you tomorrow.

41:42.668 --> 41:44.670
Congratulations, Luke.

41:54.846 --> 41:57.215
RED:
Look, I don't condone violence,

41:57.248 --> 42:00.285
but I can understand why people
would be passionate about this.

42:00.318 --> 42:03.154
This was basically
a senatorial coup d'état.

42:03.188 --> 42:04.723
JULES: I'm angry.
(crowd chanting)

42:04.756 --> 42:07.125
Since when can the government
just do what it wants?

42:07.158 --> 42:08.326
This is why voters have
to get involved.

42:08.359 --> 42:10.161
We need a revolution

42:10.195 --> 42:12.297
to show politicians
how angry we are.

42:12.330 --> 42:13.665
We are angry.

42:13.699 --> 42:15.200
(video stops)

42:20.271 --> 42:22.173
(truck beeping outside)

42:22.207 --> 42:24.209
(truck brakes squeal softly)

42:41.793 --> 42:43.829
Sorry about sleeping
on the couch.

42:43.862 --> 42:46.164
I think I just nodded off
and never came back.

42:46.197 --> 42:48.266
Mm-hmm.

42:48.299 --> 42:50.068
You sleep well?
You good?

42:52.070 --> 42:53.304
What?

42:53.338 --> 42:56.307
I said sorry
about sleeping on the couch.

42:56.341 --> 42:58.243
I think I nodded off...
