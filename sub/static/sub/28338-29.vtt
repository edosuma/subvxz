[sigh] Of course.

09:24.750 --> 09:26.880
We infected Marco
with our sad vibes.

09:26.880 --> 09:29.580
Wait, wait, wait.
So what does that mean?

09:29.580 --> 09:32.750
I think it means
you're stuck here.

09:34.290 --> 09:36.580
[Mr. Diaz]
I just don't understand!

09:36.580 --> 09:37.960
-[elevator music playing]
-How could they throw away

09:37.960 --> 09:39.710
their whole relationship
like that?

09:39.710 --> 09:41.710
Is love... a lie?

09:41.710 --> 09:44.000
[Teen Sadness operator]
So this Star and Tom,

09:44.000 --> 09:45.920
are they your friends
from school?

09:45.920 --> 09:48.330
They are friends
with my son, Marco!

09:48.330 --> 09:49.920
Wait, your son?!

09:49.920 --> 09:51.540
I thought you were
a sad teen!

09:51.540 --> 09:54.040
Oh, no, no, no.
I am a sad grown man.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.330
This hotline
is for teens only.

09:55.330 --> 09:56.880
[click, dial tone]

09:58.040 --> 10:00.960
Psst. Hey, Tom.
You awake?

10:00.960 --> 10:02.750
No.

10:02.750 --> 10:05.120
You're-- But--
But you're talking
right now.

10:05.120 --> 10:06.250
You're right.

10:06.250 --> 10:08.330
Miraculously,
I'm talking in my sleep.

10:08.330 --> 10:09.920
It's a demon power.

10:09.920 --> 10:11.920
Wait. Is--
Is that a thing?

10:11.920 --> 10:12.960
Of course it isn't, Marco!

10:12.960 --> 10:14.330
That'd be stupid.

10:14.330 --> 10:18.000
Okay, okay.
Sorry for bothering you.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.920
No, look, I'm sorry, man.
I-- I just--

10:20.920 --> 10:22.830
I think I'm
too emotionally exhausted

10:22.830 --> 10:24.250
to hold a conversation
right now.

10:24.250 --> 10:25.920
Dude. I get it.

10:25.920 --> 10:28.330
It took me months
to get over Jackie.

10:28.330 --> 10:29.670
Yeah, but did it really?

10:29.670 --> 10:31.330
Yes, it did!

10:31.330 --> 10:33.830
And I get
what you and Star
are going through.

10:33.830 --> 10:35.670
Thanks.

10:35.670 --> 10:37.290
I just--
You know, I just hope I--

10:37.290 --> 10:38.620
I get some time.

10:38.620 --> 10:40.040
Some calm time without any--

10:40.040 --> 10:41.670
-Guys!
-[Tom] Gaaaah!

10:41.670 --> 10:44.040
Ohh! Please, use your hands!

10:44.040 --> 10:45.620
What's happening?

10:45.620 --> 10:48.540
I don't know, but something
super, super weird.

10:48.540 --> 10:50.750
It's not just the portals
that are all out of whack!

10:50.750 --> 10:51.880
Look! Call Mom!

10:51.880 --> 10:53.000
[female voice]
Calling Mom.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.330
[line rings, static]

10:55.330 --> 10:57.460
Um, maybe she's asleep?

10:57.460 --> 10:59.880
Uh-uh. Call Ponyhead!

10:59.880 --> 11:01.290
Calling Ponyhead.

11:01.290 --> 11:03.420
[ring, static]

11:03.420 --> 11:06.620
But Ponyhead?
I mean, she stays up
till at least 4 A.M.

11:06.620 --> 11:10.960
So... what?
Are our emotions
doing this, too?

11:10.960 --> 11:13.830
No. There's definitely
something bigger going on here.

11:13.830 --> 11:15.710
I don't know what it means
or why it's happening,

11:15.710 --> 11:17.540
but I think it's really bad.

11:17.540 --> 11:18.540
[exhales]

11:18.540 --> 11:20.120
We have to go back to Mewni.

11:20.120 --> 11:21.580
[helicopter buzzing]

11:21.580 --> 11:23.540
[explosion]
