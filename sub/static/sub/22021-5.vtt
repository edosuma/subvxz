WEBVTT

00:01.418 --> 00:02.703
Previously on "Designated Survivor”...

00:02.836 --> 00:04.702
[Aaron] Did you and Damian
break into a storage unit?

00:04.838 --> 00:05.828
Yeah.

00:05.964 --> 00:08.045
| can't run interference for someone
who works for another government.

00:08.717 --> 00:10.424
-Wells.
-No. I'm gonna walk you out.

00:10.552 --> 00:11.929
I'm touched.

00:12.054 --> 00:14.466
[Alex] You find it plausible
that a contractor

00:14.598 --> 00:17.135
would think that my mother
was the right person to bribe?

00:17.267 --> 00:19.759
-We have circumstantial evidence.
-That my mother is a criminal?

00:20.521 --> 00:21.886
Did you accept a bribe?

00:22.022 --> 00:22.807
Yes.

00:22.940 --> 00:25.272
[Tom] It's a 30-year-old transgression
that your mom made

00:25.400 --> 00:27.812
in an effort to save her husband.
People will understand that.

00:27.945 --> 00:30.607
It's an FBI subpoena.
It's for your mother.

00:32.073 --> 00:34.441
[birds chirping]

00:37.246 --> 00:41.160
The scourge of gun violence
afflicts millions.

00:41.291 --> 00:45.910
And nation-states that sit idly by
while their citizens traffic in this evil

00:46.046 --> 00:48.162
aren't merely complicit.

00:48.298 --> 00:51.336
They're agents,
merchants of death.

00:51.468 --> 00:54.301
[branches rustling]

00:59.643 --> 01:00.883
Hello?

01:02.145 --> 01:03.431
Is someone there?

01:03.564 --> 01:05.054
[wings flapping]

01:12.489 --> 01:13.445
-[gasps]
-[gunshot]

01:13.574 --> 01:14.359
[whistle blows]

01:14.491 --> 01:16.949
[man 1] Up the wing. Up the wing.
He's offside! He's offside!

01:17.077 --> 01:17.942
Watch it. Watch it.

01:21.665 --> 01:22.905
[man 2] Take the shot!

01:23.834 --> 01:24.869
Over here! Over here!

01:25.002 --> 01:26.367
Check! Check him!

01:26.503 --> 01:27.538
[grunts]

01:27.671 --> 01:28.536
-Oh!
-Oh!

01:28.672 --> 01:30.128
-[whistle blows]
-Are you all right, sir?

01:30.924 --> 01:32.790
That's the best you got, Senator?

01:32.926 --> 01:35.668
| thought they bred hockey players
up there in Minnesota.

01:37.681 --> 01:38.637
[man] Center!

01:39.182 --> 01:40.138
Right here.

01:40.267 --> 01:41.132
All right, pass it.

01:41.268 --> 01:42.303
[whistle blows]

01:42.436 --> 01:43.551
[indistinct conversations]

01:43.687 --> 01:46.145
My point is that this financial scam
didn't just hit the rich.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.890
It wiped out hundreds of thousands
of state employee pensions.

01:49.026 --> 01:52.360
$8 billion in savings,
gone, up in smoke.

01:52.487 --> 01:54.398
You want me to support
your pension bailout bill.

01:54.531 --> 01:58.149
But my party does not believe in bailouts.
We believe in individual responsibility.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.492
Until it's time to bail out
Wall Street and the banks.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.362
Then the Republicans are all for it.

02:03.123 --> 02:06.081
You have a sponsor for the bill.
A Democratic sponsor.

02:06.209 --> 02:09.247
We need bipartisan support
to get it across the finish line.

02:09.378 --> 02:10.914
Come on, Alan.
That's why we're here.

02:11.048 --> 02:12.914
Government exists to help people
who can't help themselves.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.381
That is not government, sir.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.091
-That i-is charity.
-[scoffs] Fine.

02:16.219 --> 02:19.177
Then I'll make a stipulation that
the American people are suckers.

02:19.306 --> 02:22.014
Come on, how long have we been
playing hockey together... three years?

02:22.559 --> 02:25.551
I've never even asked you
to cross-check someone for me.

02:25.687 --> 02:28.520
| understand. But, sir, this...
this is a big ask.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.562
Then don't do it for me.
Do it for your own conscience.

02:32.736 --> 02:36.445
Barton Cushing's swindle is gonna cost
the American people $31 billion.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.780
We're facing a potential run
on the banks.

02:38.909 --> 02:40.775
Markets are teetering on free-fall.

02:40.911 --> 02:42.276
If we don't shore up
consumer confidence,

02:42.412 --> 02:44.574
we might as well just jump
headfirst into the abyss.

02:46.208 --> 02:50.122
-I'll run it up the flagpole.
-Thank you. I appreciate it.

02:50.253 --> 02:52.085
-Yes, sir.
-Good game.

02:52.214 --> 02:53.329
Good game, sir.

02:57.010 --> 03:00.093
Sir, a member of Parliament
was just murdered in Rock Creek Park.

03:00.222 --> 03:01.633
| have the British Prime Minister for you.

03:01.765 --> 03:03.176
[cellphone beeps]

03:04.101 --> 03:05.341
Madam Prime Minister...

03:06.269 --> 03:09.261
[Aaron] Why was a Member of Parliament
jogging in Rock Creek Park this morning?

03:09.398 --> 03:11.639
Charlotte Thorn was the British rep
at this week's G-20 conference.

03:11.775 --> 03:13.482
They were touting her as a future P.M.

03:13.610 --> 03:14.816
What do we know about this?

03:14.945 --> 03:16.151
Well, right now, not much.

03:16.279 --> 03:17.986
One to the head
while she was jogging.

03:18.115 --> 03:19.776
<i>D.C. Metro says
there's no witnesses.</i>

03:19.908 --> 03:21.649
-Did she have any enemies?
-Oh, plenty.

03:21.785 --> 03:23.150
She was outspoken on everything,

03:23.286 --> 03:26.278
from women's rights to illegal arms
dealing to corporate responsibility.

03:26.415 --> 03:27.496
You name it.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.410
Well, we're already fielding calls
about safety concerns

03:29.543 --> 03:31.079
from jumpy foreign leaders
that are threatening

03:31.211 --> 03:32.667
-to pull out of the G-20 conference.
-[cellphone buzzes]

03:32.796 --> 03:34.662
No. That can't happen.
Not when the Kirkman agenda

03:34.798 --> 03:36.584
is to take a bigger role
on the international stage

03:36.717 --> 03:39.505
with the IMF, the environment,
arms control. We need this.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.092
-All right, I'll keep you posted.
-Thank you.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.804
Well, 10 Downing's all over this.
They want their best guy on it.

03:49.271 --> 03:50.102
| know.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.436
You're speechless.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.932
Just take a moment, you know,
gather your thoughts,

03:54.067 --> 03:55.683
and when you work out
what you're gonna say--

03:55.819 --> 03:58.060
-You again?
-Such a wordsmith.

03:58.655 --> 04:01.522
So, it turns out you're only persona
non grata on this side of the pond

04:01.658 --> 04:05.117
until they need your expertise.
Chuck over there has been sharing his.

04:06.455 --> 04:07.661
Yeah.

04:07.789 --> 04:10.827
Thorn's upcoming speech to the G-20
was leaked on the Internet.

04:14.004 --> 04:15.494
Wow.

04:15.630 --> 04:17.962
She really is going after
illegal arms dealers.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.707
And their state sponsors.

04:19.843 --> 04:22.335
-She was going to name names.
-You know, the G-20 summit

04:22.471 --> 04:24.508
used to be about global economics.

04:24.639 --> 04:27.176
Now everybody's talking about
gun violence in America.

04:27.309 --> 04:28.970
Well, in England, we're talking about
our brightest candle

04:29.102 --> 04:32.345
-being snuffed out in America.
-[Chuck] I just heard from D.C. Metro.

04:32.481 --> 04:34.518
They found a 9 mm shell casing
at the scene.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.151
All right, let's start
at the British Embassy.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.359
- I got us an appointment there at noon.
-I got us in at 10:00.

04:39.488 --> 04:40.819
Tally ho, Agent Wells.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.156
[door opens]

04:51.166 --> 04:52.531
President Dietrich, I assure you,

04:52.667 --> 04:55.375
every attendee will have their own
Secret Service detail now,

04:55.504 --> 04:58.587
and we've widened the presence of
the FBI and the police around the city.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.047
Your delegate has nothing
to worry about.

05:02.886 --> 05:04.593
Yes, sir, of course.

05:04.721 --> 05:05.927
| understand.

05:06.056 --> 05:08.047
Thank you. Goodbye.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.763
I'm sorry about Charlotte Thorn.

05:11.895 --> 05:13.511
| really liked her.

05:14.898 --> 05:16.388
Me, too.

05:17.901 --> 05:20.518
Have you made a decision
about a lawyer for your mother?

05:21.321 --> 05:23.562
What about McKinley and Bradshaw?

05:23.698 --> 05:25.530
-They're a great firm.
-[Alex] Their white-collar practice

05:25.659 --> 05:29.118
isn't as big as it used to be, but...
Davenport and Williams?

05:29.246 --> 05:31.078
They got a full acquittal
for Senator Downing.

05:31.206 --> 05:33.948
But that place
is a Republican stronghold.

05:34.084 --> 05:36.416
Alex, any one of these firms
will do a great job.

05:36.545 --> 05:37.956
But you know my recommendation.

05:38.088 --> 05:40.420
-Kendra Daynes.
-Present company excluded,

05:40.549 --> 05:42.290
she's the best lawyer I know.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.382
With the added benefit
that she's easy to find.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.798
The way she handled
Hannah's investigation,

05:46.930 --> 05:48.967
it just... it rubbed me the wrong way.

05:49.099 --> 05:50.965
Wasn't it you who once told me
that that's what

05:51.101 --> 05:53.138
a good lawyer's supposed to do:
rub you the wrong way?

05:53.270 --> 05:55.181
That's how you know
they're doing their job?

05:55.856 --> 05:57.142
-Ah--
-Sir.

05:57.274 --> 05:59.436
Victims' rights advocate
Alice Roland is here.

05:59.568 --> 06:00.774
Thank you.

06:01.945 --> 06:05.063
Alex, please. Just call her.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.821
-Everybody, please sit.
-Mr. President.

06:09.953 --> 06:11.318
Alice, it's nice to see you again.

06:11.454 --> 06:13.832
We appreciate your meeting
with us again, sir.

06:13.957 --> 06:16.790
-But the people that I represent--
-I know.

06:16.918 --> 06:19.660
-They want action, not just words.
-What they want is their money back.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.914
And as long as I'm their advocate,
| don't intend to rest until I get it.

06:23.049 --> 06:25.336
And I share your desire,
which is why I've met with all of you

06:25.468 --> 06:26.845
three times over the last four months.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.802
Three times, because
we're not making any progress.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.467
It might not seem like it to you,
but I promise you, we are making progress.

06:31.600 --> 06:32.840
Not fast enough, sir.

06:32.976 --> 06:36.139
The fat cats that got screwed
by Barton Cushing will survive.

06:36.271 --> 06:38.683
But the beneficiaries of
the compromised state pension funds,

06:38.815 --> 06:40.931
they need this money to live.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.183
They're teachers, firefighters,
secretaries--

06:43.320 --> 06:46.153
The backbone of America. And I am
trying to get relief for all of them.

06:46.281 --> 06:47.988
Trying is not the same as getting.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.241
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

06:51.828 --> 06:54.286
These people don't want to work
until they're 75.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.280
They want to be able
to take a vacation,

06:56.416 --> 06:58.999
pay for their healthcare,
enjoy their golden years.

06:59.127 --> 07:01.414
| know you're frustrated. I am, too.

07:01.838 --> 07:03.875
But I need you to trust me.

07:04.007 --> 07:06.248
And we are closer than you think.

07:10.013 --> 07:11.378
So Halloween's just around the corner.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.471
-You know what I don't like?
-Candy?

07:13.600 --> 07:15.716
Tricks. I do like treats, though.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.138
And a great treat
would be confirmation

07:17.270 --> 07:18.556
of the President's slate
of judicial nominees.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.190
| laid the groundwork
for your meeting

07:20.315 --> 07:22.181
with Senator Krantz
from the Judiciary Committee.

07:22.317 --> 07:24.308
-She promised a rubber stamp.
-Good.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.900
Hey, Halloween's coming up.

07:26.029 --> 07:27.895
Did she give you
the whole trick or treat spiel?

07:28.031 --> 07:29.521
Yes. She doesn't like tricks.

07:29.658 --> 07:31.899
-No, she doesn't like candy.
-I like candy fine.

07:32.035 --> 07:33.901
No. Only Necco Wafers.
The pink ones.

07:34.037 --> 07:36.153
Okay, Willy Wonka, are you ready
for your auto exec meeting?

07:36.289 --> 07:38.326
Yep. Ready to hawk the President's
Clean Air Initiative.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.323
-Only one problem.
-What?

07:39.459 --> 07:41.746
-I don't know what the hell I'm doing.
-You're a senior staffer

07:41.878 --> 07:44.336
pitching in on the policy side because
we're short-handed. Suck it up.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.750
More like I'm gonna blow.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.043
Lyor, did you know that--

07:47.175 --> 07:49.883
If you do the Halloween thing again,
I'll murder you with an axe.

07:50.011 --> 07:52.173
-Bet I know what he's dressing as.
-Dead man walking, actually,

07:52.305 --> 07:54.546
which is what we're all gonna be
in five minutes.

07:54.683 --> 07:56.765
-Why?
-Carson Kramer.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.304
We need to find the President.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.558
Senator Rouse, I just want
to thank you for joining us.

08:01.690 --> 08:02.930
Of course.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.727
Senator,
you've been highly critical

08:04.859 --> 08:07.601
of what you term
"government handouts.”

08:07.737 --> 08:09.774
So, what about
the pension bailout bill?

08:09.906 --> 08:11.522
Another handout.

08:11.658 --> 08:14.616
-But the President's a big proponent.
-Yes.

08:14.744 --> 08:17.122
And, um, to be frank,
I'm not quite sure why.

08:17.247 --> 08:19.705
| met with him to discuss it, and...

08:20.709 --> 08:24.919
he called the American people...
suckers.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.208
Excuse me, Senator. He said what?

08:27.340 --> 08:28.421
His exact words were,

08:28.550 --> 08:29.711
"I'll make a stipulation

08:29.843 --> 08:32.460
that the American people are suckers.”

08:32.595 --> 08:35.724
Wow. It looks like the President's
the one who may need a bailout.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.090
Yes, Carson. I was pretty shocked
when I heard that myself.

08:38.226 --> 08:41.969
That disloyal, treacherous, lying--

08:42.105 --> 08:43.595
He wasn't lying.

08:43.732 --> 08:44.972
Sir?

08:45.108 --> 08:47.224
He betrayed my confidence.
He took me out of context.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.067
-But he wasn't lying.
-It doesn't matter.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.857
Sir, you have a very distinct brand.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.480
You're Honest Tom.
Man of the people.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.448
-If that's compromised--
-Lyor's right, Mr. President.

08:55.577 --> 08:57.443
This goes to your core identity.
We can't spin this.

08:57.579 --> 09:00.617
Exactly, 'cause it's a middle finger
aimed squarely at your base.

09:00.749 --> 09:02.831
And I don't like to traffic
in overstatement, sir.

09:02.959 --> 09:05.417
If this sticks, it's political Armageddon.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.037
Mr. President, you have calls

09:08.173 --> 09:10.335
from the Senate Minority
and Majority Leaders,

09:10.467 --> 09:12.083
the House Speaker,
and the House Minority Leader.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.300
The Four Horsemen of the apocalypse.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.765
Put them through.

09:17.140 --> 09:18.630
One at a time, please.

09:22.812 --> 09:23.973
[beep]

09:26.024 --> 09:27.981
[theme music]

09:34.949 --> 09:36.280
[all speaking at once]

09:36.409 --> 09:39.276
We are working with the British government
to investigate M.P. Thorn's murder.

09:39.412 --> 09:42.074
And we'll have another update for you
as soon as one is warranted. Yes?

09:42.207 --> 09:44.699
-What about Senator Rouse?
- have no comment about Senator Rouse.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.040
So you're not denying
the President said--

09:46.169 --> 09:47.284
Once again, folks, the conversation

09:47.420 --> 09:49.502
that the President had with Senator Rouse
was a private one.

09:49.631 --> 09:51.713
You know I don't comment
on the President's private conversations.

09:51.841 --> 09:53.673
[Natalie] Meaning you're not
issuing a denial.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.759
How did you just misconstrue
everything I just said?

09:55.887 --> 09:58.049
-How did I misconstrue it?
-You understand misconstruction, Natalie.

09:58.181 --> 09:59.467
-I've read your pieces.
-Come on, Seth.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.306
You got to give us something.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.471
And if you're not commenting
on private conversations,

10:03.603 --> 10:05.890
can you speak as to the follow-up
from Suckergate?

10:06.022 --> 10:08.138
[scoffs] Don't call it a gate, Carla.
It's not a gate.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.982
Look, the President's record speaks
for itself in terms of the esteem that

10:11.111 --> 10:13.728
-he holds for the American people.
-Are you saying Senator Rouse is lying?

10:13.863 --> 10:16.355
[Tom] You can assure your constituents
that word does not reflect

10:16.491 --> 10:20.029
how I feel about them, Mr. Speaker.
Of course. Thank you. Goodbye.

10:21.371 --> 10:23.032
[Lyor] They're calling it
Suckergate, sir.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.370
[sighs]

10:24.499 --> 10:26.081
Suckergate.
There are no good gates.

10:26.209 --> 10:27.699
Not Watergate, not Irangate, not--

10:27.836 --> 10:30.077
| think we should just
go about our business.

10:30.213 --> 10:34.002
All due respect, sir, we can't.
This will have a knock-on effect.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.716
[Lyor] You need to issue a strong denial.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.710
-[scoffs] I can't.
-Yes, sir. You can.

10:37.846 --> 10:40.258
If the President says he didn't say
something, it was never said.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.882
I'm not gonna start fighting distortions
with falsehoods.

10:43.017 --> 10:45.509
Besides, you said I had a good reputation
because I was honest.

10:45.645 --> 10:49.104
-Now you want me to start lying?
-Yes, to preserve that reputation.

10:49.232 --> 10:51.519
-You heard what you just said, right?
-Sir, I see Lyor's point.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.517
-Our options here are very limited.
-Well, I've got one.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.940
I'll sit down with Senator Rouse.
He's a good and honorable man.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.188
| consider him a friend.
We'll sort this thing out.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.065
-I'll set it up.
-Thank you.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.743
If you'd have told me
he was this honest,

11:06.875 --> 11:09.367
- never would have taken this job.
-You realize that's bananas, right?

11:09.502 --> 11:11.288
| don't like scruples.
They're impractical.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.583
His scruples are the reason
why everyone in this building

11:13.715 --> 11:16.582
-would have run through a wall for him.
-Tell me that when our agenda's dead

11:16.718 --> 11:19.426
because America thinks the President
is an elitist hypocrite.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.764
Aaron says he'll have an update
on the Thorn investigation shortly.

11:23.892 --> 11:26.304
And, per your request, I moved up
your meeting on judicial appointments

11:26.436 --> 11:28.143
-with Senator Krantz.
-Good. We need a win.

11:28.271 --> 11:30.478
-I want to talk to you about the lobby.
-Okay.

11:30.607 --> 11:34.316
There are candies there. Hard candies.
Some might call them "suckers."

11:34.444 --> 11:36.310
And, so, I wondered
if I should remove them.

11:36.446 --> 11:38.528
-You're kidding, right?
-Right.

11:39.908 --> 11:41.273
Remove them immediately.

11:43.953 --> 11:46.411
| asked Ms. Thorn not to go out
without a security detail.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.701
-But she wouldn't listen to me.
-Have there been threats?

11:48.833 --> 11:51.040
All the time. As Embassy Security head,

11:51.169 --> 11:53.501
| can't protect those who won't listen.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.166
[Hannah] We read Ms. Thorn's speech.

11:55.298 --> 11:57.505
It seems she was going after
arms dealers this time.

11:57.634 --> 12:00.752
[Peyton] Yes, I wanted her to tone it
down. But she turned it up.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.594
Ms. Lane, you were her aide
for six years.

12:02.722 --> 12:05.589
Is there anyone in particular
she crossed swords with?

12:05.725 --> 12:08.467
Darius Cray. A British importer-exporter.

12:08.603 --> 12:10.514
Well, that's a cover for arms dealing.

12:10.647 --> 12:14.015
He supplies half the African conflicts.
He's on most of Europe's no-fly lists.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.436
But he's running amok in America.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.024
| didn't see his name
in the speech.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.144
[Peyton] That's because
he called me a few days ago.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.442
Warned me that Charlotte
had better not identify him.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.611
His was the one name
| convinced her to pull out.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.155
I'm betting he thought
she was going to put it back in.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.862
He sounds like a good place to start.
Where is he?

12:28.998 --> 12:30.659
In town, thankfully enough.
At the Gallagher.

12:30.792 --> 12:33.250
But we've already reached out.
He's not answering questions.

12:33.378 --> 12:35.790
Well, people like that, you just need
to know how to ask.

12:35.922 --> 12:38.630
[indistinct conversations]

12:40.343 --> 12:41.799
Excuse me. I didn't order this.

12:41.928 --> 12:44.169
Actually, we're here to talk
about what you ordered.

12:44.305 --> 12:47.639
We need to ask you a few questions
about Charlotte Thorn, Mr. Cray.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.633
[Catherine] I am eating lunch
with my husband.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.351
Catherine, I'll see you
back in the room.

12:55.358 --> 12:57.099
[sighs]

12:57.235 --> 12:58.725
| never met Charlotte Thorn.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.147
Acquainted only
by reputation then?

13:00.280 --> 13:03.068
Because she sure had one
for getting under your skin.

13:03.199 --> 13:07.409
Yes, slander was a speciality of hers.
| didn't appreciate it.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.244
[Hannah] What are you doing in town, sir?

13:09.372 --> 13:11.704
G-20 conference.
A good place to ply my trade.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.073
Legal trade.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.496
-Not according to Ms. Thorn.
-Ergo the slander.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.370
-Did you threaten her?
-Only with lawsuits.

13:18.798 --> 13:22.587
| have a $100-million
legitimate munitions business.

13:22.719 --> 13:26.428
| pay taxes.
| abide by all the applicable laws.

13:26.556 --> 13:29.639
Yet some people insist
on turning me into this bogeyman.

13:29.767 --> 13:32.759
Well, here's the thing. We're not
D.C. Metro and we're not State.

13:32.895 --> 13:35.148
And you can't brush us off
with some canned statement.

13:35.273 --> 13:38.106
Tell us where you were at 6:00
this morning, we'll leave you alone.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.225
No, you'll leave me alone now.

13:41.154 --> 13:44.488
| have the best lawyers
in the city on a retainer.

13:44.615 --> 13:46.117
Ambush me again,

13:46.242 --> 13:48.199
and I'll sue you for harassment.

13:51.205 --> 13:53.071
Think we flushed him out?

13:53.207 --> 13:55.585
Well, I guess we'll find out
soon enough.

13:58.796 --> 14:01.413
[Lyor] 14 long-standing vacancies
on the federal appellate bench,

14:01.549 --> 14:03.131
it's a national embarrassment.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.796
Addressing that is
an administration priority.

14:05.928 --> 14:07.714
Our slate of candidates is moderate,

14:07.847 --> 14:10.464
specifically chosen to achieve
broad bipartisan support.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.216
We're reaching across party lines.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.434
-We wish we could reach back.
-Why can't you?

14:15.271 --> 14:17.729
When we had preliminary
discussions about judges,

14:17.857 --> 14:19.723
the President was
in a very different position.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.566
His centrist politics
were gathering steam.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.731
We thought he was a man
who should be listened to.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.524
Well, he is. He's the President.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.943
-Of a country of suckers.
-Really, Senator Krantz--

14:28.076 --> 14:30.158
| know how that remark
played out in my state.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.618
Not as bad as my following his lead
now will play.

14:32.747 --> 14:36.331
Senator, put politics aside for a second.
You're an attorney.

14:36.459 --> 14:39.167
You know every name on our list
is eminently qualified.

14:39.295 --> 14:41.286
Yes. But so are these.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.420
[laughs]

14:46.552 --> 14:48.930
None of these people have
President Kirkman's endorsement.

14:49.055 --> 14:51.843
Exactly. So none of them are toxic.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.715
Let me know what you think.

14:59.649 --> 15:01.435
| think I hate lawyers.

15:01.567 --> 15:05.026
[Alex] I think my mother's subpoena
is prosecutorial bad face.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.656
How do you figure, ma'am?

15:06.781 --> 15:09.614
There's no evidence of
any contemporary wrongdoing.

15:09.742 --> 15:13.235
And this attempt to tie her
into some conspiracy involving bribery

15:13.371 --> 15:16.204
in Eric Little's recent d--
| mean, it's ridiculous.

15:16.332 --> 15:18.243
Agreed. But you need
to keep emotion out of it.

15:18.376 --> 15:20.617
-We're talking about my mother--
-I understand.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.619
But John Foerstel
is a former U.S. Attorney.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.132
He will use your emotion against you.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.419
As proof that we're trying
to hide something.

15:26.551 --> 15:27.757
Yes.

15:29.178 --> 15:31.044
Which is why I'd like to be clinical.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.217
Sticking to the four corners
of the document

15:33.349 --> 15:35.215
is our best hope
of quashing the subpoena.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.809
| need to know
my family is protected.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.053
And I just haven't seen
enough evidence from you

15:40.189 --> 15:41.771
that you really understand that.

15:41.899 --> 15:43.401
| do, ma'am.

15:43.526 --> 15:45.392
And I've represented 11 senators

15:45.528 --> 15:47.644
who have been targets
of a criminal investigation.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.441
Not a single one was indicted.

15:50.741 --> 15:52.152
I'm experienced.

15:52.785 --> 15:53.946
And I'm good.

15:58.332 --> 15:59.709
What do you need from me?

15:59.834 --> 16:01.370
Just your trust.

16:02.336 --> 16:04.418
Let me do what I do.

16:04.547 --> 16:06.379
And I'll keep you posted.

16:08.968 --> 16:09.924
[door opens]

16:10.052 --> 16:11.759
-Alan.
-Mr. President.

16:11.888 --> 16:14.880
| was just explaining to Lyor and Emily
how we are friends.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.056
And I have to be honest.

16:17.185 --> 16:19.426
When among friends,
there is an expectation

16:19.562 --> 16:23.100
-that what one says remains private.
-I'm sorry if I violated that expectation.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.644
Well, you did. And I need you
to set the record straight.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.060
Well, I'm sorry, sir. I didn't lie.

16:29.197 --> 16:30.687
So I can't issue a retraction.

16:30.823 --> 16:31.779
I'm not asking you to.

16:31.908 --> 16:34.445
| just want you to provide
the full context of our discussion.

16:34.577 --> 16:36.784
Which was me asking you
to sign on to a bill

16:36.913 --> 16:39.154
that I thought would be helpful
to the average American.

16:39.290 --> 16:40.451
An overture you portrayed

16:40.583 --> 16:42.699
as the President's contempt
for average Americans.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.166
Alan, I know you don't believe that,

16:44.295 --> 16:46.832
but I can't have the American people
believing that, either.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.841
I'm sorry, sir, |- can't help you.

16:51.969 --> 16:55.007
You may wish to reconsider
that position, Senator.

16:55.139 --> 16:56.925
No, Ms. Rhodes, I don't think so.

16:58.309 --> 17:01.722
You say you're not a politician,
then you coerce me into backing a bill--

17:01.854 --> 17:03.436
Asking you for your support
is hardly coercion!

17:03.564 --> 17:06.181
It is if the person asking
is the President, sir.

17:06.317 --> 17:10.026
But more to the point, I have
an obligation I owe to my constituents.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.565
Which should include an obligation

17:11.696 --> 17:13.563
not to misrepresent
the President's words.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.484
| stood up to those words.

17:15.617 --> 17:18.827
My office received over 1,500 calls today
thanking me for that.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.695
| cannot defend you, sir.

17:20.830 --> 17:23.492
Senator, I'm not asking you for your
defense. I'm asking you for your honesty.

17:23.626 --> 17:25.742
You're out there portraying me
as an enemy of the people.

17:25.877 --> 17:26.992
That stops now!

17:27.128 --> 17:30.918
With respect, sir, if you don't want
to be the people's enemy,

17:31.050 --> 17:34.042
you need to start talking about them
as if they were your friends.

17:36.097 --> 17:37.553
I'll see myself out.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.262
[sighs]

17:46.065 --> 17:47.521
Well, who would have thought it?

17:47.650 --> 17:50.267
Homespun Tom Kirkman,
an elitist snob.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.861
He didn't just put his foot
in his mouth on this one.

17:52.989 --> 17:56.357
He put his whole leg.
Who's the sucker now, Mr. President?

17:56.492 --> 17:58.358
And we're already seeing
the fallout from--

17:58.494 --> 18:00.781
-[television shuts off]
-[Lyor] Yeah.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.369
So, in the last eight hours,

18:02.498 --> 18:04.785
we've lost congressional support
for our judicial slate.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.033
Your pension-bailout bill;
that's gone belly up.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.456
And the only topic of conversation
at the G-20 conference

18:09.589 --> 18:11.705
-is the murder rate in America.
-What's the press coverage?

18:11.841 --> 18:14.378
Uh, the Post and the Journal
have hit out at you over Suckergate.

18:14.510 --> 18:15.841
The Times is running an op-ed

18:15.970 --> 18:17.836
on the Administration's
failure to rein in arms dealers.

18:17.972 --> 18:20.839
We're looking at a perfect storm, sir.
So, we have to take emergency action.

18:20.975 --> 18:22.841
Finding Thorn's killer,
that's part of the solution.

18:22.977 --> 18:25.844
The other part is cauterizing Suckergate.

18:25.980 --> 18:28.096
Look, I understand we've taken
a hit for this thing--

18:28.232 --> 18:30.974
No, no, sir. It's much more than that.
This thing, it's made you radioactive.

18:31.110 --> 18:34.478
-And the fallout's just gonna get worse.
-Fine. What do you suggest?

18:34.614 --> 18:35.945
Oppo research on Senator Rouse.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.735
It's a silver bullet.
It'll stop the bleeding.

18:41.871 --> 18:44.203
Lyor, bullets don't stop bleeding.
They start it.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.073
We need to stabilize your base, sir.

18:47.209 --> 18:48.995
If I go down this road,
there's no turning back.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.368
-We will find another way.
-Mr. President--

18:50.504 --> 18:52.711
We will find another way.

18:55.509 --> 18:56.715
Thank you, sir.

19:02.558 --> 19:04.265
Seth? I need a minute.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.885
| have nothing else to say
about Suckergate, Tiffany.

19:07.021 --> 19:09.228
Good. Because I wanted
to ask about a subpoena.

19:09.357 --> 19:10.347
What subpoena?

19:10.483 --> 19:12.599
One a source tells me was
issued to the White House

19:12.735 --> 19:15.272
in connection with an investigation
into Icarus Astrotech.

19:15.404 --> 19:17.111
-To whom at the White House?
-You tell me.

19:17.239 --> 19:18.616
[laughs] You're fishing.

19:18.741 --> 19:20.197
-I'm going to publish.
-Publish what?

19:20.326 --> 19:23.444
A story about a subpoena issued to
an unspecified person in this building?

19:23.579 --> 19:24.785
So you're denying it then?

19:24.914 --> 19:26.575
That someone in the White House
has been subpoenaed?

19:26.707 --> 19:28.243
-Categorically.
-Seth, come on--

19:28.376 --> 19:29.582
Go fish.

19:32.963 --> 19:34.954
[Hannah] Darius Cray's boat is moored
at the Port of Baltimore.

19:35.091 --> 19:38.174
Three days ago, he extended
his slip rental for two weeks.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.547
And this afternoon,
right after we spoke to him,

19:40.680 --> 19:43.593
he filed paperwork with the harbormaster
to leave tonight.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.055
[Aaron] How strong a suspect is he?

19:45.184 --> 19:47.175
A flight risk. No alibi.
Plenty of motive.

19:47.311 --> 19:49.643
Plus we have video of his car
outside Charlotte Thorn's hotel

19:49.772 --> 19:51.388
two nights before she was killed.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.356
Which means he could have been
spoiling for a confrontation.

19:53.484 --> 19:55.270
Is it enough circumstantial
evidence for a warrant?

19:55.403 --> 19:57.770
If you know the right judge.
Give me an hour.

19:58.280 --> 20:01.648
[man] We've lost a lot of support with
this "Americans are suckers" comment.

20:01.784 --> 20:02.615
[Seth] Okay, hold on.

20:02.743 --> 20:05.485
The word "suckers" has nothing to do
with the President's Clean Air Initiative.

20:05.621 --> 20:06.577
[woman] Sure it does.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.073
The President's plan requires us
to up emissions standards.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.494
That's gonna cost us
hundreds of millions.

20:10.626 --> 20:12.082
And we want something in return.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.748
[man] But, if the Administration's
been crippled, what can you do for us?

20:14.880 --> 20:16.962
The federal tax incentives
the President's proposing are--

20:17.091 --> 20:18.081
Seth, you're not listening.

20:19.176 --> 20:22.168
-How's he gonna pass those now?
-With a little elbow grease.

20:22.304 --> 20:25.217
Everybody, please sit.
I'm sorry for interrupting.

20:25.349 --> 20:28.512
Seth, you're doing a great job
explaining the importance of this bill.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.976
But I wanted to take a moment
and come down here

20:31.105 --> 20:33.312
and thank you myself
for being here, for listening.

20:33.441 --> 20:37.651
And I hope you will join me in making
a better future for our children.

20:42.658 --> 20:43.648
Right.

20:44.827 --> 20:46.693
They're not the friendliest group.

20:46.829 --> 20:50.038
| have to say, I was hoping
for a little support from you.

20:50.166 --> 20:51.873
My cars are electric.

20:52.001 --> 20:53.867
I've delayed automating
my plants at your request.

20:54.003 --> 20:55.118
| gave at the office.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.120
| know. I know. And generously.

20:57.256 --> 21:01.716
But you're an industry leader.
Your silence spoke volumes.

21:01.844 --> 21:04.677
If you sensed a lack of enthusiasm
in there, you're right.

21:04.805 --> 21:07.217
The people in that room want to know
they're backing a winner.

21:07.349 --> 21:09.386
[sighs]
Come on. It was one word.

21:09.518 --> 21:12.852
It's not about the word, sir.
It's about leadership.

21:12.980 --> 21:15.563
If you can't lead the people,
you can't lead CEOs.

21:15.691 --> 21:18.183
| was being sarcastic.

21:19.945 --> 21:22.198
[Tom] In the end,
perception is everything.

21:22.323 --> 21:24.360
I've been fighting on behalf
of the American people

21:24.492 --> 21:25.823
from the second I was sworn in.

21:25.951 --> 21:28.158
Now they think
I'm fighting against them.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.073
No, they don't, sir.

21:30.206 --> 21:32.493
Everywhere we go,
you inspire people.

21:33.209 --> 21:34.620
But the problem is...

21:36.212 --> 21:38.579
It's all right, Mike.
Finish the sentence.

21:38.714 --> 21:42.173
Sir, when someone takes a cheap shot,
you don't respond.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.134
| don't like mudslinging.
It's not who I am.

21:45.262 --> 21:47.879
Don't sling mud, sir. Sling hope.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.719
See, that's the fight people want.

21:51.185 --> 21:52.516
It's the hope you give them.

21:52.645 --> 21:56.183
And sometimes it gets lost
under all these attacks.

21:56.899 --> 21:59.231
You just might have a future
in politics, Mike.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.601
[chuckles] No, sir.

22:01.737 --> 22:04.274
| like my fights
where I can see them.

22:04.406 --> 22:05.737
Right in front of me.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.781
Smart.

22:07.910 --> 22:09.492
Thank you.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.575
[fog horn blows]

22:16.710 --> 22:18.087
They're unloading something.

22:22.591 --> 22:25.629
[fog horn blows]

22:25.761 --> 22:27.422
[radio beeps]
Wells to base.

22:27.555 --> 22:28.636
Suspect's leaving the scene.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.926
We're heading over there now
to check out the boat.

22:49.076 --> 22:50.578
[latch opens]

23:04.300 --> 23:06.883
[indistinct conversations in distance]
[chain rattles]

23:23.569 --> 23:24.730
[man groans]

23:33.829 --> 23:35.411
It's Darius Cray.

23:39.627 --> 23:40.742
[Aaron] You know, Cray's boat

23:40.878 --> 23:44.166
had a $5 million cache
of black-market munitions.

23:44.298 --> 23:46.255
And we think he was making
a back-room deal

23:46.383 --> 23:48.499
with one of the G-20 delegates
to arm an insurgency.

23:48.636 --> 23:50.172
His arrest was all over the wire, sir.

23:50.304 --> 23:52.511
Mumbai is linking him
with arming Tamil separatists.

23:52.640 --> 23:55.177
The French are blaming him
for selling C-4 to Basque insurgents.

23:55.309 --> 23:57.425
And we're the ones who brought him
to justice. It's excellent.

23:57.561 --> 23:59.723
That's burying the lead.
What's important here, right now,

23:59.855 --> 24:01.892
is whether or not he was connected
to Thorn's murder.

24:02.024 --> 24:03.890
The gun found on him
was the same model,

24:04.026 --> 24:05.516
same caliber used
to kill Charlotte Thorn.

24:05.653 --> 24:06.768
We're running ballistics.

24:06.904 --> 24:08.315
-Is Cray talking?
-No, sir.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.528
He's in recovery and lawyered up.

24:09.657 --> 24:11.614
As soon as ballistics is back,
I'll let you know.

24:11.742 --> 24:15.110
-Okay. We should issue a press release.
-Yeah. When ballistics is back.

24:15.245 --> 24:16.986
It can focus on the arrest
of a notorious arms dealer.

24:17.122 --> 24:18.533
Which would step on the arrest
of Charlotte Thorn's killer.

24:18.666 --> 24:21.283
Anything to get us off Suckergate.
Seth, have you read the papers?

24:21.418 --> 24:22.874
No, I get my news from carrier pigeon.

24:23.003 --> 24:25.244
Okay, sir, there's obviously
spirited disagreement

24:25.381 --> 24:27.873
about our next steps to take
to help regain our momentum.

24:28.008 --> 24:30.545
Yes. I can see that.
And I have an idea.

24:31.387 --> 24:33.094
| would like to do an OTR.

24:33.222 --> 24:36.340
An "on the road"? I like the impulse, sir.
What I don't like is the risk.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.967
Too many variables we can't control.
We should do a one-on-one.

24:39.103 --> 24:42.016
With Carson Kramer. Same forum as when
Senator Rouse made his accusation.

24:42.147 --> 24:44.684
Release the oppo on Rouse right
before you go on just to set the stage.

24:44.817 --> 24:47.605
Lyor, I'm not interested
in the politics of personal destruction.

24:47.736 --> 24:49.397
Respectfully, sir,
this is not something that--

24:49.530 --> 24:51.362
Look, if the problem is
that I've lost the people,

24:51.490 --> 24:54.733
| need to take my argument to the people.
Show them that I'm fighting their fight.

24:54.868 --> 24:56.199
| want to do an OTR.

24:56.328 --> 24:57.739
-Shoot for lunchtime.
-Yes, sir.

24:58.914 --> 25:00.416
[Emily] Okay, lunch.
That gives us three hours.

25:00.541 --> 25:04.125
| want every detail stage-managed.
A diner. He'll order a hamburger.

25:04.253 --> 25:07.871
| don't want anything foofy on the menu
like Dijon mustard or profiteroles.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.418
-Diners don't have profiteroles.
-Yeah, exactly.

25:09.550 --> 25:10.756
We should hand-pick the audience.

25:10.884 --> 25:12.386
Yeah, we'll stock them
with salt-of-the-earth types.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.297
Folks who've been victimized
by the pension fraud.

25:14.430 --> 25:16.592
-Kirkman fans.
-I'll get started on the vetting.

25:16.724 --> 25:19.967
Emily, you're logistics.
Seth, you do your thing with words.

25:20.102 --> 25:22.093
Yeah, I got a word for you.

25:23.230 --> 25:27.269
[police radio chatter]

25:27.401 --> 25:28.391
[Alex] Good morning, Kendra.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.894
Mrs. Kirkman, I wasn't expecting you.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.395
| thought I should be here.

25:32.531 --> 25:33.817
Of course. That's absolutely your right.

25:33.949 --> 25:36.657
Uh, Cindy, make sure there's a chair
for Mrs. Kirkman in the gallery.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.196
Oh, I'd like to second chair.

25:39.955 --> 25:41.241
I'll see you inside.

25:44.793 --> 25:46.875
Respectfully, ma'am,
| don't think that's a good idea.

25:47.004 --> 25:48.119
Well, why not?

25:48.756 --> 25:52.249
Because this proceeding is about
a subpoena issued to your mother.

25:52.384 --> 25:53.249
Exactly.

25:53.385 --> 25:55.672
Which is precisely why
| recommend against your involvement.

25:55.804 --> 25:58.011
Because of your personal interest.

25:58.140 --> 26:00.347
| appreciate your concern.

26:00.476 --> 26:02.342
But I need you to appreciate mine.

26:02.478 --> 26:05.891
| can't stand by and watch determinations
being made about my family

26:06.023 --> 26:07.764
and not participate.

26:07.900 --> 26:10.107
If anything went wrong,
| would never forgive myself.

26:11.987 --> 26:13.978
I'm sure you understand.

26:15.991 --> 26:17.607
-Yes, ma'am.
-Good.

26:19.495 --> 26:22.453
[Kendra] Your Honor, this subpoena
is a classic fishing expedition.

26:22.581 --> 26:23.821
The simple fact that
we're seeking documents

26:23.957 --> 26:26.415
from the President's mother-in-law
does not make it a fishing expedition.

26:26.543 --> 26:29.035
30 years of documents.
And in service of a wild theory

26:29.171 --> 26:32.630
alleging a convoluted bribery scheme
that spans decades.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.920
A theory for which
Mr. Foerstel has no evidence.

26:35.052 --> 26:36.338
It's called discovery, Your Honor.

26:36.470 --> 26:38.006
If we had the evidence,
we wouldn't need the subpoena.

26:38.138 --> 26:40.300
Yes, but we still need probable cause
to prove a crime has been committed.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.389
-A crime was committed.
-30 years ago.

26:42.518 --> 26:44.976
Mrs. Kirkman?
Are you also appearing as counsel?

26:45.104 --> 26:47.846
-Yes, Your Honor.
-So noted on the record.

26:47.981 --> 26:51.440
A crime was committed 30 years ago.
A crime which can no longer be charged.

26:51.568 --> 26:53.479
The warrant alleges
an ongoing conspiracy--

26:53.612 --> 26:54.647
| know what the warrant alleges.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.487
Your Honor, I believe
my co-counsel's point--

26:56.615 --> 26:58.151
That this is a malicious prosecution.

26:58.283 --> 27:01.275
How is the mere issuance of a subpoena
a malicious prosecution?

27:01.411 --> 27:03.243
The suggestion that
there was some nefarious

27:03.372 --> 27:05.409
pay-for-play scandal
involving my mother.

27:05.541 --> 27:07.908
That she could be implicated
in the murder of Eric Little,

27:08.043 --> 27:09.829
a man she hasn't even seen for 30 years.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.999
Your Honor, can we please
get a 10-minute recess

27:12.131 --> 27:15.214
-so I can consult with my co-counsel?
- I think that would be an excellent idea.

27:16.760 --> 27:20.219
Mrs. Kirkman, we agreed
to keep these arguments technical.

27:20.347 --> 27:21.587
But not antiseptic.

27:21.723 --> 27:23.509
You're not making
any headway in there.

27:23.642 --> 27:26.600
The best basis for quashing the subpoena
is its overbreadth.

27:26.728 --> 27:30.642
| totally disagree. The subpoena is based
on investigational subterfuge.

27:30.774 --> 27:32.014
Illegal activity.

27:32.151 --> 27:34.062
Which are arguments
| will now have to make

27:34.194 --> 27:36.151
now that our procedural attack
is out the window.

27:36.280 --> 27:39.113
-Well, then, make them.
- I will. But not with you as co-counsel.

27:39.241 --> 27:41.152
[scoffs] Excuse me?

27:41.285 --> 27:44.949
Ma'am, I was asked to do a job. And
| will do it to the best of my ability.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.696
But I cannot do it
if you're compromising me.

27:46.832 --> 27:47.788
Well...
[scoffs]

27:47.916 --> 27:50.248
-That was not my intent.
-But it's your effect.

27:51.086 --> 27:53.202
If you want to argue the motion,
you're welcome to.

27:53.338 --> 27:57.423
But if I'm arguing it, it needs to be
without your interference.

28:03.557 --> 28:04.763
[Tom] Oh, she's beautiful.

28:04.892 --> 28:06.803
And you're right.
She looks a lot like my daughter.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.551
[camera shutters click]

28:08.687 --> 28:12.055
Firefighters have our backs.
And it's time we have theirs.

28:13.108 --> 28:16.317
Alex, you're wrong about the Redskins.
But you're right about everything else.

28:16.445 --> 28:18.152
Does this mean you're gonna try my chili?

28:18.280 --> 28:21.318
-[chuckles] Not a chance.
-[laughter]

28:21.450 --> 28:23.066
-Hi.
-[lwoman] Aww.

28:23.202 --> 28:24.112
[baby coos]

28:24.244 --> 28:26.406
Oh, she was talking to me
about tuition reform.

28:26.538 --> 28:27.619
[laughter]

28:27.748 --> 28:30.581
Don't worry, kiddo.
I'm gonna get to it. I promise.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.666
I've never seen anyone
this good with crowd work.

28:32.794 --> 28:34.660
It's because
it's not work for him.

28:34.796 --> 28:35.786
It's who he is.

28:35.923 --> 28:37.288
[baby coos]

28:37.424 --> 28:38.414
-Mr. President!
-Mr. President!

28:38.550 --> 28:39.836
[Tom] Thank you all for coming out.

28:39.968 --> 28:42.050
-Mr. President!
-Thank you.

28:42.179 --> 28:43.715
-Best burger in town.
-[Alice] Mr. President.

28:43.847 --> 28:44.837
Mr. President.

28:44.973 --> 28:48.637
-Alice, how are you?
-Not good, sir.

28:48.769 --> 28:51.261
I'm hearing that
the pension bailout bill is dead.

28:51.396 --> 28:52.773
That's not true.

28:52.898 --> 28:54.684
Well, the people I represent
want their futures back.

28:54.816 --> 28:57.274
Can you promise me
that you can still help them?

28:57.402 --> 28:59.188
Well, |-I can't promise--

28:59.321 --> 29:01.312
Well, then you're right, Mr. President.
We are suckers...

29:02.324 --> 29:04.156
...for trusting you.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.330
[Tom] Thank you...

29:14.503 --> 29:16.039
It wasn't that bad.

29:16.171 --> 29:18.538
No, she's right.
It was catastrophic.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.335
[Tom] Yeah.

29:20.467 --> 29:21.582
So...
[sighs]

29:21.718 --> 29:23.550
You're already lost cachet
with Congress.

29:23.679 --> 29:26.717
Stonewalling your judicial nominees
was the canary in the coal mine.

29:26.848 --> 29:28.759
Your whole legislative agenda's
at risk now.

29:28.892 --> 29:32.556
-It was one word. I was being sarcastic.
-Not to put too fine a point on it,

29:32.688 --> 29:35.555
but the rule is,
things last one news cycle or 10.

29:35.691 --> 29:38.308
We kill this story today, sir,
or it Kills us.

29:38.443 --> 29:40.650
-Emily?
-The business community is jumping ship.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.565
The media is turning on you.

29:42.698 --> 29:44.405
If we wake up tomorrow
and Suckergate's the lead,

29:44.533 --> 29:47.241
-the spiral may be irreversible.
-This is ridiculous.

29:47.369 --> 29:49.110
| mean, there has to be a solution.

29:49.246 --> 29:50.111
Well, there is, sir.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.451
It's sitting right on that coffee table.

29:57.713 --> 29:59.044
[sighs]

30:16.648 --> 30:18.355
Call Carson Kramer.

30:19.234 --> 30:20.315
Yes, sir.

30:25.198 --> 30:28.111
Your Honor, the basis for this subpoena
is an illegal search.

30:28.243 --> 30:30.701
Your Honor, the Fourth Amendment
has zero applicability to the request

30:30.829 --> 30:32.411
for documents connected to a company

30:32.539 --> 30:34.246
that Mrs. Booker admitted
she received a bribe from.

30:34.374 --> 30:37.082
-There's probable cause--
-I'd like to hear Ms. Daynes out.

30:37.210 --> 30:38.462
Mr. Foerstel is right.

30:38.587 --> 30:40.294
There is probable cause
for this subpoena.

30:40.422 --> 30:41.912
But it stems from Hannah Wells,

30:42.049 --> 30:43.790
who removed a hospital record
from an active crime scene.

30:43.925 --> 30:45.757
| don't see how that
invalidates the subpoena.

30:45.886 --> 30:48.298
The hospital record was obtained
illegally and without a warrant.

30:48.430 --> 30:49.295
Fruit of the poisonous tree?

30:49.431 --> 30:50.637
-Yes, Your Honor.
-Hold on.

30:50.766 --> 30:52.302
You're complaining about
the conduct of Agent Wells?

30:52.434 --> 30:53.924
Agent Wells works
for the White House.

30:54.061 --> 30:55.096
But Mrs. Booker doesn't.

30:55.228 --> 30:56.969
Then why is the White House
counsel representing her?

30:57.105 --> 30:58.607
It doesn't matter
who's representing her.

30:58.732 --> 31:00.314
What matters is whether
her rights were violated.

31:00.442 --> 31:01.773
I'm inclined to agree.

31:01.902 --> 31:03.609
Wait, Judge, there are
exigent circumstances.

31:03.737 --> 31:07.196
Agent Wells removed that document
because she was pursuing Patrick Lloyd.

31:07.324 --> 31:09.907
And if you were subpoenaing
Patrick Lloyd, I might look the other way.

31:10.035 --> 31:13.744
But you're not, and I won't.
Motion to quash granted.

31:16.792 --> 31:19.204
[announcer 1] Quick out,
they pick up the first down.

31:19.336 --> 31:20.576
10 inside the 35.

31:20.712 --> 31:22.578
-[announcer 2] A little bit of push--
-[knock on door]

31:22.714 --> 31:24.330
No doubt.
There might have been

31:24.466 --> 31:25.956
some offensive interference,
but it was not called.

31:26.093 --> 31:28.084
-[television shuts off]
-[knock on door]

31:40.232 --> 31:42.018
Shipping out tonight.

31:42.150 --> 31:43.481
Yeah?

31:43.902 --> 31:46.485
Do you need a ride to the airport?

31:46.613 --> 31:47.819
Sure.

31:48.657 --> 31:52.696
You know, I can always call DHS
and have you deported again.

31:52.828 --> 31:54.694
It's like Uber. With handcuffs.

31:54.830 --> 31:57.822
The ongoing pleasures
of American hospitality.

32:00.168 --> 32:01.829
Look, I just wanted to say...

32:03.672 --> 32:05.538
| know you've had my back.

32:05.674 --> 32:08.336
And, um, thanks.

32:10.345 --> 32:11.801
You, too.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.171
I'm kind of picky about
who I work with.

32:14.307 --> 32:17.174
And I didn't hate you.

32:18.353 --> 32:20.310
So, that's kind of a big deal for me.

32:31.324 --> 32:34.692
[cellphone buzzes]

32:36.037 --> 32:37.539
-[cellphone beeps]
-Yeah?

32:39.332 --> 32:40.868
Um, sure.

32:41.001 --> 32:42.867
| think I can track Damian down.
Yeah.

32:44.004 --> 32:45.586
Okay. See you soon.

32:45.714 --> 32:46.670
[cellphone beeps]

32:46.798 --> 32:48.254
There's been a development
in the Thorn case.

32:48.383 --> 32:50.374
Aaron Shore needs to see us
right away.

32:54.931 --> 32:57.263
We got ballistics back
for Darius Cray's gun.

32:57.392 --> 33:00.259
-It didn't kill Charlotte Thorn.
-Darius is an arms dealer.

33:00.395 --> 33:02.762
-He's got hundreds of guns.
-And there's something else.

33:02.898 --> 33:05.890
[Chuck] There was activity in one
of Cray's accounts after he was shot.

33:06.026 --> 33:08.859
A transfer of 100 million Euros
to a Swiss bank account.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.979
[Aaron] And the only person with access
to that account was Catherine, his wife.

33:12.115 --> 33:13.822
You saying we've been
chasing the wrong Cray?

33:13.950 --> 33:16.237
Yeah, Catherine's been calling the shots.
He was just a front.

33:16.369 --> 33:17.200
M-Maybe.

33:17.329 --> 33:20.242
But we still don't know that Darius
didn't kill Charlotte Thorn.

33:20.373 --> 33:21.750
Yeah, we do.

33:21.875 --> 33:24.162
-What?
-Check this out.

33:26.713 --> 33:28.920
This was taken yesterday morning.

33:33.345 --> 33:36.508
Darius was moving guns
when Charlotte Thorn was killed.

33:38.225 --> 33:39.886
[Aaron] Which means
| have to tell the President

33:40.018 --> 33:41.884
that our investigation is ongoing.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.931
And you two have to get back to work.

33:49.444 --> 33:51.606
[Carson] It's been a rough couple
of days, Mr. President.

33:51.738 --> 33:53.320
[Tom] Yes. Yes, it has.

33:53.448 --> 33:56.065
But you won't hear me complain.
Not for a second.

33:56.201 --> 33:57.942
Because I know that
there are people out there

33:58.078 --> 34:00.194
who are really having
a rough time right now.

34:01.122 --> 34:02.499
Now, I know
you want to address

34:02.624 --> 34:04.991
Senator Rouse's, uh, incendiary claim

34:05.126 --> 34:07.743
that you called
the American people suckers.

34:07.879 --> 34:10.337
-The floor is yours, sir.
-Thank you.

34:10.465 --> 34:11.967
| think that there is something

34:12.092 --> 34:13.924
the American people should know
about Senator Rouse.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.469
And that is...

34:22.893 --> 34:24.635
[quietly] Go there. Please go there.

34:26.481 --> 34:27.812
[scoffs]

34:27.940 --> 34:30.433
-...that he is telling the truth.
-Oh, my God.

34:30.569 --> 34:33.027
-What is he doing?
-He took my words out of context,

34:33.154 --> 34:35.612
but he is quoting me accurately.
-This is bad.

34:35.739 --> 34:38.152
So you really think
the American people are suckers?

34:39.286 --> 34:41.493
Yes. I guess so.

34:42.789 --> 34:45.371
Because they believe
in the American dream.

34:45.500 --> 34:48.117
This idea that our best tomorrows
are in front of us,

34:48.253 --> 34:50.460
regardless of what today
might be saying.

34:50.589 --> 34:53.126
And if that makes you a sucker,

34:53.257 --> 34:54.918
then count me in.

34:55.302 --> 34:56.463
Less bad.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.802
The great American generations
that have come before us...

34:58.930 --> 35:01.137
-Bring it home, sir. Bring it home.
-...have always managed

35:01.266 --> 35:03.052
to pull together when times were tough.

35:03.184 --> 35:06.973
We cannot be the exception.
And that's why it is so important

35:07.105 --> 35:09.563
that Congress gets behind
the pension bailout bill.

35:09.691 --> 35:11.978
Too many Americans have had
their security and their dreams

35:12.110 --> 35:14.647
-snatched away from them.
-Trending good.

35:14.779 --> 35:16.861
It's our turn to fix that.

35:16.990 --> 35:20.278
So, I am promising the American people
that I will not rest

35:20.410 --> 35:23.493
until that security
and those dreams

35:23.622 --> 35:25.329
have been restored.

35:31.713 --> 35:33.704
[Lyor chuckles]
I'm calling our polisters.

35:34.883 --> 35:36.840
[chuckles]

35:36.968 --> 35:39.175
Our boss may have just
pulled off the great escape.

35:39.554 --> 35:40.715
[sighs]

35:51.650 --> 35:53.015
Thank you for seeing me, sir.

35:53.151 --> 35:54.687
You're gonna have
to make it quick, Senator.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.196
| don't have a lot of time
for you right now.

35:56.321 --> 35:58.858
| understand.
| just wanted to let you know

35:58.990 --> 36:00.776
I've decided to support
your pension bailout bill.

36:00.909 --> 36:02.866
-You have?
-Yes, sir.

36:02.994 --> 36:05.702
Well, I hope nobody coerced you
into changing your mind.

36:05.830 --> 36:09.573
| don't expect you to forgive
my political opportunism.

36:11.920 --> 36:14.378
| have an explanation, not an excuse.

36:14.506 --> 36:16.088
I'm listening.

36:17.926 --> 36:21.089
Sonia has, um... ovarian cancer.

36:21.221 --> 36:22.757
Oh, my God.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.218
| am so sorry.

36:25.350 --> 36:27.182
A-Alan, please... please sit.

36:27.936 --> 36:28.846
Thank you, sir.

36:32.607 --> 36:34.393
[sighs]

36:36.111 --> 36:38.148
So it's two years in.

36:38.279 --> 36:41.408
Been an up-and-down battle.
Stressful.

36:43.702 --> 36:46.034
| took comfort elsewhere.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.450
An affair.

36:52.377 --> 36:53.538
|-I called it off,

36:53.670 --> 36:54.785
and, um...

36:55.797 --> 36:58.255
Sonia and I are in counseling.
We're trying to work it out,

36:58.383 --> 37:01.421
but my marriage
is hanging on by a thread.

37:01.553 --> 37:04.420
And the children...

37:04.806 --> 37:06.968
I'm so sorry you're going through this.

37:09.811 --> 37:11.802
We all have our cross to bear.

37:13.314 --> 37:16.147
...guess I...

37:18.236 --> 37:19.522
needed a victory.

37:19.654 --> 37:22.897
| was desperate,
and when I saw the opportunity, I--

37:26.286 --> 37:27.447
Alan.

37:27.579 --> 37:29.320
[voice breaking]
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

37:32.292 --> 37:35.284
Thank you for coming to me
a-and explaining this.

37:38.131 --> 37:40.122
[knock on door, door opens]

37:40.842 --> 37:42.924
Mr. President, Alice Roland is here.

37:43.052 --> 37:45.259
Thank you, Lily.
I'm gonna need a moment.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.677
[exhales sharply]

37:57.692 --> 37:59.478
| need you to look at this.

38:06.409 --> 38:09.697
-Oh, my God.
- I didn't use it.

38:10.705 --> 38:12.116
| couldn't.

38:13.583 --> 38:14.869
But if I have it,

38:16.211 --> 38:18.373
you need to take care of this now.

38:25.553 --> 38:27.885
Man, our boss has more lives than a cat.

38:28.473 --> 38:30.089
Good thing for us kittens.

38:30.225 --> 38:32.182
So, since we're not
burning the midnight oil...

38:32.310 --> 38:34.392
Oh, come by anytime.
I'll put out a bowl! of milk.

38:34.521 --> 38:36.432
-We can torture metaphors.
-Sounds good.

38:36.564 --> 38:38.680
-Hey.
-What is it?

38:38.817 --> 38:40.774
Is that like a mannequin challenge thing
or something?

38:40.902 --> 38:42.233
Never mind.

38:42.862 --> 38:44.239
[chuckles]

38:45.740 --> 38:48.232
Our latest, uh, poll numbers.

38:48.368 --> 38:49.608
Hmm.

38:49.744 --> 38:51.246
Our boss did okay tonight, huh?

38:51.371 --> 38:52.987
He did okay.

38:53.122 --> 38:55.739
You think he's weak
for not using the oppo, right?

38:57.335 --> 38:59.702
No. I think he's the President.

39:02.924 --> 39:04.289
[Tom] Thank you for coming.

39:04.425 --> 39:05.586
| invited you back here

39:05.718 --> 39:09.586
because I wanted to tell you myself
how much I respect you.

39:10.932 --> 39:13.674
Well, that respect is mutual, sir.

39:15.895 --> 39:18.683
| saw your interview on television.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.568
| know what kind of man you are.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.809
An honest man.

39:23.945 --> 39:25.481
Thank you.

39:25.613 --> 39:27.274
| appreciate that.

39:27.782 --> 39:31.070
| do the best I can,
and I know you do, too.

39:32.370 --> 39:35.237
Your work as a victims' advocate
IS inspiring.

39:35.373 --> 39:37.489
And... and I hope you don't mind,

39:37.625 --> 39:40.208
but I wanted to find out
what motivated you.

39:41.296 --> 39:44.789
And I was surprised to see that
you weren't one of the victims.

39:45.967 --> 39:48.629
But instead, the wife
of one of the perpetrators.

39:49.137 --> 39:51.003
Your late husband managed
one of the feeder funds

39:51.139 --> 39:54.131
and funneled hundreds of millions
of dollars back to himself.

39:57.562 --> 39:59.223
Yes.

40:00.815 --> 40:04.399
So, you became an advocate
out of a sense of obligation...

40:05.945 --> 40:09.063
...to those who paid such a high price
while your family prospered.

40:12.744 --> 40:14.155
Yes.

40:15.496 --> 40:17.407
The guilt must be overwhelming.

40:19.417 --> 40:22.580
| would expect at times
you feel like it's hard to even go on.

40:28.843 --> 40:30.459
[chuckles]

40:30.595 --> 40:33.678
| feel like that every time
| walk into this building.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.850
And sit in that chair...

40:40.104 --> 40:42.436
and have someone call me
"Mr. President"...

40:45.860 --> 40:48.272
...simply because I survived,

40:49.864 --> 40:51.650
because I was lucky.

40:55.536 --> 40:57.277
You know what people
like you and |

40:57.413 --> 40:59.450
are supposed to do
with that kind of luck?

40:59.582 --> 41:01.164
No, sir.

41:01.709 --> 41:03.450
Pay it forward.

41:06.798 --> 41:08.505
| promise you...

41:08.633 --> 41:10.294
In fact, I pledge to you...

41:11.386 --> 41:16.506
that I will do everything in my power
to try and pay it forward.

41:18.726 --> 41:20.512
And I know you will, too.

41:23.022 --> 41:24.478
Yes.
