00:02.336 --> 00:04.076
MATT: Previously on Heroes.

00:04.297 --> 00:06.913
I think I found someone
to fill Joseph's shoes.

00:07.175 --> 00:09.257
How do I look?
Like everybody else.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.458
I've never met you before.

00:10.595 --> 00:12.176
You pulled me
from the 424 bus

00:12.263 --> 00:14.254
after it crashed
at Lexington and 53rd.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.724
What made you
become a paramedic?

00:15.808 --> 00:18.049
I wanted to save lives
instead of watching them pass.

00:18.144 --> 00:20.351
You're exactly
who I'd hoped you'd be.

00:20.771 --> 00:22.307
Hi. I need a file.

00:22.523 --> 00:23.808
Who're you listening to?

00:25.026 --> 00:26.562
I'm talking to myself.

00:33.951 --> 00:35.532
Seriously, what are you?

00:35.661 --> 00:38.949
A vampire? An alien?
Some kind of freakish
government experiment?

00:39.457 --> 00:41.573
I saw this girl
on YouTube.

00:41.667 --> 00:44.158
She was born with
this gene that doesn't
let her feel any pain.

00:44.295 --> 00:46.286
I didn't tell her.
She just found out.

00:46.422 --> 00:47.628
Gretchen is
not the enemy.

00:47.757 --> 00:50.544
She's just a girl.
And she's the only
friend that I've made.

00:50.635 --> 00:52.626
This is my mess.
And I'm gonna clean it up.

00:52.762 --> 00:55.799
Iâ€™m tired of keeping
this secret to myself.

00:57.975 --> 01:00.011
Do you want to be
my roommate?

01:00.978 --> 01:02.138
To closure.

01:02.313 --> 01:03.473
MILLIE: To closure.

(SIREN WAILS)

01:39.225 --> 01:40.635
Had a little
too much to drink?

01:49.068 --> 01:52.606
On the ground.
Hands behind your head.
Down! Now!

02:11.465 --> 02:13.547
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

02:21.559 --> 02:24.551

Watch your back,
will you?

(SIZZLING)

02:35.656 --> 02:39.365

02:39.452 --> 02:42.159
This is my favorite
part of the day.

02:43.372 --> 02:45.408
SAMUEL:
It's full of possibility.

02:45.624 --> 02:48.036
Before the inevitable
monkey wrenches
come looking for us.

02:48.127 --> 02:49.287
(LAUGHS)

02:49.378 --> 02:53.496
But more than anything,
it's about being
with all of you.

02:53.591 --> 02:55.707
I know grace is
a supper thing,

02:55.801 --> 03:01.012
but every morning
I thank heaven and earth
for our family.

03:03.017 --> 03:06.225
Sadly, Joseph's death
has left us an empty seat,

03:06.312 --> 03:07.427
a broken circle.

03:07.521 --> 03:10.729
Butlfeeler
we're on the way
to mend it.

03:12.193 --> 03:14.900
There are lost lambs
out there.

03:15.029 --> 03:18.738
They're like us,
but they're hiding.
Alone.

03:19.158 --> 03:21.444
Pretending to be that
which they are not.

03:21.535 --> 03:22.866
It's sad, pathetic.

03:23.662 --> 03:26.574
These people,
they desperately need
what we have.

03:26.665 --> 03:30.874
Understanding,
unconditional love,
family, trust.

03:31.212 --> 03:33.703
Who are we
to deny anyone that?

03:33.923 --> 03:36.835
Today is an important day
for us, our family.

03:36.967 --> 03:39.219
And for one of them, too.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.513
Because by day's end,

03:45.601 --> 03:48.889
we will have
a full table again.

03:49.939 --> 03:51.054
Eat.

03:57.571 --> 04:01.439
Okay, I gotta ask.
What's with the ear-to-ear,
smiley?

04:03.411 --> 04:05.777
This... This is cool.

04:05.955 --> 04:07.161
Drinking chocolate milk?

04:07.248 --> 04:10.115
No. Me. In college.

04:10.209 --> 04:12.825
In a dining hall
with my new
college roommate.

04:12.920 --> 04:16.458
No snipers shooting at me.
No serial killers hunting me.

04:16.549 --> 04:18.335
It's a refreshing
change of pace.

04:18.426 --> 04:20.758
Yeah. Tedium can be
such a thrill.

04:20.928 --> 04:25.592
l have been chasing
normal life forever
and I finally caught it.

04:25.724 --> 04:28.761
I mean, don't get me wrong,
the chocolate milk is awesome,

04:28.894 --> 04:33.354
but right here, right now,
is full of possibilities.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.101
I can be anyone.

04:35.484 --> 04:38.772
GIRL: Claire Bennet,
you can't escape
your destiny.

04:39.697 --> 04:42.188
l'm Becky Taylor.
Psi Alpha rush chair.

04:42.283 --> 04:43.898
Your mom
Sandra's sorority.

04:43.993 --> 04:45.233
Your mom was
in a sorority?

04:45.911 --> 04:47.742
She totally was.

04:47.830 --> 04:49.616
Hi, Becky.
Hi.

04:50.082 --> 04:52.164
BECKY: So, National has you
on a list of legacies,

04:52.251 --> 04:54.037
but we haven't heard
from you about rush.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.961
I'm not really sure
I'm a sorority girl.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.457
BECKY: Neither
was I at first.

04:58.591 --> 05:01.298
So, listen, open rush
starts today at the house,

05:01.385 --> 05:02.750
why don't you come by
and meet the girls?

05:03.137 --> 05:04.798
No strings.
Yeah.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.473
Why not?
She's gonna have to pass.

05:07.892 --> 05:10.258
Well, great,
I'll see you there.

05:10.352 --> 05:11.387
Thanks.

05:14.064 --> 05:17.056
Isn't this what
we've been talking about?
Possibilities.

05:17.151 --> 05:20.018
I mean, I think my mom
is still friends with
her sorority sisters.

05:20.112 --> 05:22.023
Sororities are just
a social crutch

05:22.114 --> 05:24.025
for people who can't
make their own friends.

05:26.911 --> 05:30.654
She said,
"No strings attached."
What's the harm?

05:30.873 --> 05:33.205
(SIGHS) The harm is
that they get you alone

05:33.292 --> 05:35.157
and replace you
with Stepford Claire.

05:36.795 --> 05:39.582
Well, okay. How about
I don't go alone?

05:40.090 --> 05:43.002
Yeah. No.
No. No way.

05:43.093 --> 05:46.585
Please. Pretty please.
I'll be your best friend.

05:47.473 --> 05:49.088
I'll throw in
a chocolate milk.

05:49.433 --> 05:50.889
(LAUGHS)

05:51.977 --> 05:53.513
(SIGHS)

05:54.021 --> 05:56.979
What would Stepford Gretchen
wear to one of these things?

05:57.066 --> 05:58.681
(LAUGHS)

06:05.741 --> 06:06.947
Captain Lubbock?

06:07.493 --> 06:09.484
l'm Dr. Gibson. Madeline.

06:10.788 --> 06:12.369
Where's Dr. Verheiden?

06:12.456 --> 06:13.491
Retired.

06:13.958 --> 06:15.198
You're new?

06:15.292 --> 06:18.125
I've been interning
with Dr. Verheiden
at A.U. for three years,

06:18.254 --> 06:20.245
specializing in
psychopathy, malignant
narcissism disorders...

06:20.339 --> 06:24.173
And how many actual,
real-life criminal-psych
consults have you done?

06:24.260 --> 06:25.500
lncluding this one?

06:25.594 --> 06:26.583
(LAUGHS)

06:31.016 --> 06:32.096
So, who is he?

06:33.102 --> 06:35.718
We have no idea.
And neither does he.

06:35.813 --> 06:38.099
We found him last night
covered in dirt, blood.

06:38.190 --> 06:39.805
Bullet holes
in his jacket.

06:39.942 --> 06:41.978
The guy doesn't know his name,
what day it is, nothing.

06:43.028 --> 06:44.939
Amnesia can be
very complicated.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.861
Let me simplify it
for you, Madeline.

06:46.991 --> 06:49.653
Take out your rubber stamp
and mark this guy insane.

06:49.827 --> 06:51.488
They don't give us stamps.

06:52.997 --> 06:55.488
I'm gonna need
to talk to him.

07:01.338 --> 07:02.999

07:12.141 --> 07:15.349
Hi. My name
is Dr. Gibson.

07:16.020 --> 07:17.180
I'm here to help you.

07:17.605 --> 07:18.765
Can you tell me your name?

07:32.786 --> 07:34.196
(PANTS)

07:35.247 --> 07:37.238
There's been
a lot of that.

07:37.374 --> 07:38.830
Starts and stops?

07:38.917 --> 07:40.373
Mostly stops.

07:40.878 --> 07:41.913
What are you thinking?

07:42.880 --> 07:43.995
Could be an aphasia.

07:44.381 --> 07:45.632
Could be what?

07:45.716 --> 07:48.298
Any trauma to the head
could result in brain damage.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.216
He was like this
when we found him.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.303
Can you tell me
what happened to you?

07:55.976 --> 07:57.512

In the...

08:00.481 --> 08:01.561
In the forest.

08:03.275 --> 08:04.606
Lost.

08:07.112 --> 08:08.147
And then I was...

08:09.740 --> 08:11.071
(CRIES) Oh, God.

08:12.618 --> 08:13.733
(CRIES)

08:16.038 --> 08:17.278
Take your time.

08:20.417 --> 08:21.793
Walking.

08:23.212 --> 08:26.420
And now I'm here
in this room.

08:27.466 --> 08:29.582
In this tiny room and...

08:31.929 --> 08:34.386
Captain,
can you do me a favor
and unlock these cuffs?

08:34.473 --> 08:38.762
No. I don't make a habit
of locking myself in
with unrestrained Iunatics.

08:38.894 --> 08:40.805
Then can you leave me
your keys on the way out?

08:54.451 --> 08:59.320
Let's clean you up,
get you some clothes.
Maybe something to drink.

09:01.166 --> 09:04.124
I'm gonna help you
as best I can.

09:04.753 --> 09:08.211
Help you figure out
who you are,
put the pieces together.

09:08.298 --> 09:09.458
I promise.

09:22.062 --> 09:25.975
Emma, I wanted
to talk to you
about yesterday.

09:27.067 --> 09:30.275
Are you still seeing things,
the colors?

09:32.322 --> 09:34.483
l was thinking
more about it.

09:39.621 --> 09:41.282
I have another theory.

09:41.582 --> 09:44.995
Conversion disorder.
They used to call it...

09:48.589 --> 09:53.333
I think this whole
filing girl act is
finally getting to you.

09:58.515 --> 10:02.554
Only the ones
who happen
to be my daughter.

10:03.270 --> 10:06.854
I think this whole
focusing on work thing
is getting to me.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.022
I've been told by
more than one person

10:09.109 --> 10:12.021
that I've closed myself off
from human connection.

10:12.112 --> 10:15.696
Here, Mom. Mom, careful.
It's hot. It's hot.

10:15.949 --> 10:19.567
So this is me,
trying to connect again.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.410
Starting with you,
my family.

10:22.706 --> 10:24.697
The half that bothered
to show up, at least.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.740
You did call Nathan, right?

10:26.835 --> 10:29.542
Yeah. A couple times, Mom.
So I'm thinking, if...

10:29.630 --> 10:32.087
You didn'tjust talk
to that aide?

10:32.174 --> 10:35.962
That Elizabeth woman
is a phone-message
black hole.

10:38.096 --> 10:41.634
Can we just focus on me
for a second, Mom?

10:46.605 --> 10:50.564
DR. COOLIDGE:
Yes. You hide in here.
You're filing things.

10:50.651 --> 10:52.892
It's the waste of
a brilliant mind.

10:57.616 --> 10:58.856
Be serious.

11:09.419 --> 11:10.875
So I thought being
a paramedic,

11:10.963 --> 11:12.078
saving the most people
possible,

11:12.172 --> 11:15.209
that would fill
that hole, but I...

11:18.011 --> 11:19.091
Mom?

11:22.140 --> 11:24.517
Yes. Yes. You're right.

11:25.394 --> 11:26.429
Nathan will be fine.

11:27.020 --> 11:30.763
Let's just...
Go on with what
you were saying.

11:31.233 --> 11:32.518
Start over.

11:32.609 --> 11:33.769
I'm not starting over.

11:33.861 --> 11:36.443
I thought you said
it was important.

11:36.530 --> 11:38.521
I ran into Chief Kaufman.

11:38.615 --> 11:42.733
And he said that
you could re-start your
residency if you want.

11:44.121 --> 11:46.988
He always thought
you'd make
a wonderful doctor.

11:53.130 --> 11:54.540
It's been six years.

11:54.631 --> 11:58.374
It's time to stop
blaming yourself for
Christopher's death.

11:58.468 --> 12:02.632
You have to stop grieving
and take your life back, Emma.

12:10.606 --> 12:12.722
I'm not grieving.
I'm...

12:15.611 --> 12:16.771
Emma.

12:24.411 --> 12:25.776
I gotta go.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.404
I gotta get to work.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.492
I think I'll stay
for a while.

12:30.918 --> 12:31.998
Okay.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.825
Maybe Nathan's
just running late.

12:39.801 --> 12:41.757
It was good seeing you.
Yeah.

12:42.012 --> 12:43.422
Hey. Hey.

12:44.348 --> 12:45.428
Yes.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.590
You work too much.
You know that?

12:47.684 --> 12:48.799
Yeah. I do.

12:49.186 --> 12:50.346

all the girls
on my right,

13:35.107 --> 13:36.688
to the chairs
on the right.

13:36.775 --> 13:39.687
And all the girls
on my left, to the left.

13:41.071 --> 13:42.231
Should we make
a break for it?

13:42.406 --> 13:45.523
No. This is what
normal girls do, right?
Really?

13:45.909 --> 13:48.571
Scariest thing that
ever happened to me?
Does this count?

13:48.662 --> 13:51.153

professional show dogs.

to speak of.

Government paper.

13:56.128 --> 13:58.915

like a series of...

14:00.590 --> 14:01.796
No boyfriends.

Uh...

14:03.427 --> 14:04.963

14:07.889 --> 14:08.924
Gretchen told me.

14:09.933 --> 14:11.264
Really?

14:12.602 --> 14:14.467
