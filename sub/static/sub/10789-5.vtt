WEBVTT

00:01.834 --> 00:04.041
(THUD)

00:11.166 --> 00:12.458
HELP?

00:12.458 --> 00:13.708
WELL, HE MIGHT
NOTICE YOU FASTER

00:13.708 --> 00:17.125
IF, UM, IF YOU
LET ME DO A LITTLE WORK
ON THAT T-SHIRT OF YOURS.

00:17.125 --> 00:19.625
A FEW RIPS,
A FEW TEARS.

00:19.625 --> 00:20.959
DO WONDERS
FOR YOUR TIPS.

00:20.959 --> 00:22.166
MY WHAT?

00:22.166 --> 00:23.792
YOUR TIPS.

00:23.792 --> 00:26.000
YOUR GRATUITIES.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
(LAUGHS)

00:27.000 --> 00:28.291
WHAT DID YOU
THINK I SAID?

00:28.291 --> 00:29.667
NOTHING!

00:31.125 --> 00:32.208
YES.

00:32.208 --> 00:33.834
OH. FINALLY.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.500
COULD YOU MAKE ME WAIT
A LITTLE BIT LONGER
THE NEXT TIME?

00:35.500 --> 00:37.667
SORRY, I, UH...

00:37.667 --> 00:39.166
GUESS I FIND YOU
A LITTLE INTIMIDATING

00:39.166 --> 00:41.000
NOW THAT YOU'VE TRIED
TO RAM YOUR TONGUE
DOWN MY THROAT.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.917
I NEED 2 DRAFTS,
A BOILERMAKER,

00:43.917 --> 00:45.834
AND I THOUGHT
WE AGREED TO NEVER
SPEAK OF THAT AGAIN.

00:45.834 --> 00:46.750
YOU KNOW, I DON'T
REMEMBER HAVING
THAT CONVERSATION.

00:46.750 --> 00:48.500
WE DIDN'T.
IT WAS IMPLIED.

00:48.500 --> 00:52.291
SOCIAL CONVENTIONS DICTATE
THAT WHEN SOMETHING
EMBARRASSING HAPPENS,

00:52.291 --> 00:56.708
WE ALL TACITLY AGREE
TO NEVER SPEAK
OF THEM AGAIN.

00:56.708 --> 00:57.708
IT'S WHAT KEEPS US GOING
AS A SOCIETY.

00:57.708 --> 01:00.125
THAT...AND ALCOHOL.

01:01.458 --> 01:03.041
YEAH, WELL, I DON'T.

01:03.041 --> 01:03.542
YOU DON'T WHAT?

01:03.542 --> 01:06.500
DON'T AGREE.

01:08.208 --> 01:09.708
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I REALLY DON'T FEEL

01:09.708 --> 01:12.000
LIKE GETTING
INTO A PHILOSOPHICAL
DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.333
I JUST WOULD
LIKE YOU TO--

01:13.333 --> 01:14.166
OH, GOOD GOD!

01:14.166 --> 01:16.166
YOU TWO AREN'T
FIGHTING AGAIN,
ARE YOU?

01:16.166 --> 01:17.834
NO, NO. APPARENTLY,
WE'RE HAVING
SOME KIND OF...

01:17.834 --> 01:20.375
UH, PHILOSOPHICAL
DISCUSSION.

01:20.375 --> 01:22.625
OH. GOOD.
'CAUSE I'M LEAVING.

01:24.583 --> 01:26.583
OFF TO REHEARSAL,
WHERE I HOPEFULLY

01:26.583 --> 01:29.333
STILL HAVE
A FEW BAND MEMBERS
LEFT TO, UH, FIRE

01:29.333 --> 01:31.250
BEFORE OUR BIG
HELL'S KITCHEN

01:31.250 --> 01:33.333
DEBUT PERFORMANCE
TOMORROW NIGHT.

01:33.333 --> 01:34.917
HEY, IF YOU
WANT ME TO PUT UP

01:34.917 --> 01:36.583
SOME OF THOSE FLYERS
FOR YOU, I CAN.

01:36.583 --> 01:39.041
OH, YOU ARE A LOVE,

01:39.041 --> 01:41.917
AREN'T YOU? MMM! OH,
AND IT'S JUST GETTING

01:41.917 --> 01:43.458
A BIT CROWDED BACK THERE,
SO IF YOU TWO

01:43.458 --> 01:45.041
COULD JUST
KISS AND MAKE UP,

01:45.041 --> 01:46.875
I'M SURE THE CUSTOMERS
WOULD APPRECIATE IT.

01:52.375 --> 01:53.375
YOU TOLD HER.

01:53.375 --> 01:54.333
COINCIDENCE.

01:55.458 --> 01:56.583
WHAT? WHY
WOULD I TELL HER?

01:56.583 --> 01:59.083
TO EMBARRASS ME?

01:59.083 --> 02:03.208
OH, NOW, YOU'RE
DOIN' A PRETTY GOOD JOB
OF THAT ALL BY YOURSELF.

02:59.500 --> 03:01.500
(WHISPERING) Has anybody
told you how pretty you are?

03:07.625 --> 03:09.208
HEY.

03:09.208 --> 03:10.125
HI.

03:13.250 --> 03:14.834
UH...YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:14.834 --> 03:16.166
IT'S GETTING LATE.

03:16.834 --> 03:19.166
I SHOULD GET TO BED.

03:19.166 --> 03:20.000
BIG DAY TOMORROW.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.333
(DRUNKENLY)
NOT TO WORRY.

03:23.375 --> 03:24.291
YOU'LL BE GREAT, LUV.

03:26.917 --> 03:30.583
IF YOU WEREN'T
SUCH A DISASTER

03:30.583 --> 03:31.500
WITH WOMEN,

03:31.500 --> 03:35.542
YOU MIGHT BE SNEAKING
OFF TO JOIN HER NOW.

03:35.542 --> 03:37.291
WELL, CARRY ON.

03:37.291 --> 03:39.750
HOLD ON. YOU'RE NOT GETTIN'
RID OF ME THAT FAST.

03:42.208 --> 03:44.083
AS I SUSPECTED,

03:44.083 --> 03:46.250
YOU ARE NOT HERE
TO PARTICIPATE

03:46.250 --> 03:47.000
IN THE GENERAL
DEBAUCHERY.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.500
YOU'RE HERE
TO BORE ME

03:49.500 --> 03:52.458
WITH LITTLE
WORK-RELATED DETAILS.

03:52.458 --> 03:53.959
10 PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW
WHAT PLAN "B" IS FOR FRIDAY.

03:53.959 --> 03:56.750
TELL 'EM THERE
IS NO PLAN "B."

03:56.750 --> 03:57.750
YOU GOTTA AT LEAST
CALL HEATHER TRACY BACK.

03:57.750 --> 03:59.208
SHE'S CALLED,
LIKE, 6 TIMES
IN THE PAST 2 DAYS.

03:59.208 --> 04:04.041
LEERY, YOUR INABILITY
TO RELAX DISTURBS ME.

04:04.041 --> 04:06.291
WE'RE 3 DAYS BEHIND,
UNDER PENALTIES
EVERY DAY THIS WEEK.

04:06.291 --> 04:09.583
WE'VE GOT A MONSTER DAY
TOMORROW, NO SHOT LIST.

04:09.583 --> 04:12.375
THERE'S 70% CHANCE
OF RAIN ON FRIDAY, AND
APPARENTLY NO PLAN "B."

04:12.375 --> 04:13.917
HOW IS THAT
NO WORRIES?

04:13.917 --> 04:15.583
3 DAYS?

04:15.583 --> 04:17.708
I THOUGHT IT WAS 4.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.250
HEATHER!

04:20.250 --> 04:22.083
TODD.

04:22.083 --> 04:24.250
DON'T LOOK
SO SURPRISED.

04:24.250 --> 04:27.000
THIS IS WHAT YOU GET
FOR NOT RETURNING
MY PHONE CALLS.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
NO. IT'S LOVELY.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.375
IT'S LOVELY
TO SEE YOU.

04:34.458 --> 04:35.708
DO YOU REMEMBER DAWSON?

04:35.708 --> 04:38.500
YEAH. WE CAN B.S. THE
PLEASANTRIES LATER, SWEETIE.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.291
RIGHT NOW I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO GET ME A BETTER ROOM.

04:40.291 --> 04:43.625
THE GIRL AT THE FRONT DESK
SAID IT'S IMPOSSIBLE,

04:43.625 --> 04:46.166
BUT I'M SURE YOU CAN WORK
YOUR LITTLE P.A. MAGIC.

04:49.583 --> 04:50.708
(MOUTHING "HELP")

04:57.750 --> 05:00.083
(MUSIC PLAYING
THROUGH EARPHONES)

05:06.208 --> 05:07.500
(SHOUTS) WHAT?!

05:07.500 --> 05:08.792
(SHOUTS) NOTHING!

05:12.625 --> 05:12.959
IS IT GOOD?

05:12.959 --> 05:15.291
IS WHAT GOOD?

05:15.291 --> 05:15.875
THE BOOK.

05:15.875 --> 05:18.125
(SCOFFS)

05:18.125 --> 05:21.291
HONEY, IT'S REQUIRED.
HOW CAN IT BE GOOD?

05:21.291 --> 05:23.375
WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST THE FIRST BOOK

05:23.375 --> 05:25.417
THAT I'VE SEEN YOU CRACK
ALL SEMESTER.

05:27.291 --> 05:29.458
SHE DOESN'T ACTUALLY DRINK
THIS GREEN STUFF, DOES SHE?

05:29.458 --> 05:30.792
HEY! AUDREY!

05:30.792 --> 05:31.500
WHAT?

05:31.500 --> 05:33.000
WELL, I'M TRYIN'
TO TALK TO YOU.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.834
OK, I'M LISTENING.

05:35.834 --> 05:37.834
GREAT. THEN MAYBE
YOU CAN TELL ME

05:37.834 --> 05:39.208
WHAT'S BEEN BOTHERIN'
YOU ALL WEEK.

05:39.208 --> 05:41.291
NOTHING IS BOTHERING ME.

05:41.291 --> 05:43.667
REALLY?

05:43.667 --> 05:45.750
'CAUSE I GOTTA SAY
YOU'VE BEEN ACTIN'
A LITTLE WEIRD.

05:45.750 --> 05:47.583
OK, PACEY.

05:47.583 --> 05:49.041
DEFINE WEIRD.

05:49.041 --> 05:50.834
FINE. "WEIRD"
IS STUDIOUS.

05:50.834 --> 05:52.750
"WEIRD" IS QUIET.

05:52.750 --> 05:54.417
WHAT, SO I ACT
LIKE JOEY FOR A CHANGE,

05:54.417 --> 05:56.291
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
I'M  WEIRD?

05:57.458 --> 06:00.959
OK, FINE. LOOK, I JUST
WANT TO KNOW IF PERHAPS

06:00.959 --> 06:02.834
YOU AND JEN MIGHT'VE
GOTTEN INTO A LITTLE BIT
OF TROUBLE

06:02.834 --> 06:04.000
AT THAT PARTY LAST WEEK.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.375
NO. AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
FOR A FORMER PARTY GIRL,

06:06.375 --> 06:08.750
THAT GIRL'S NOT EVEN
ON A FIRST-NAME BASIS
WITH TROUBLE.

06:08.750 --> 06:10.166
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
JACK AND I WERE TALKING,

06:10.166 --> 06:11.625
AND HE SAID THAT HE LOST
YOU AT A CERTAIN POINT

06:11.625 --> 06:12.792
AND YOU WERE A LITTLE
WORRIED, MAYBE.

06:12.792 --> 06:14.291
WELL, YEAH. PACEY,
IT WAS CROWDED,

06:14.291 --> 06:15.917
AND JEN RAN INTO SOMEBODY
THAT SHE KNEW.

06:15.917 --> 06:18.041
OH, REALLY?

06:18.041 --> 06:19.041
A GUY?

06:19.041 --> 06:21.291
YEAH.

06:21.291 --> 06:22.542
A NICE GUY.

06:22.542 --> 06:24.458
A REGULAR KNIGHT
IN SHINING ARMOR.

06:24.458 --> 06:28.458
YEAH, I'M SURE HE WAS.
JUST LIKE ME, RIGHT?

06:29.834 --> 06:32.417
YES, HONEY.

06:32.417 --> 06:33.792
JUST LIKE YOU.

06:33.792 --> 06:36.917
YOU KNOW, FUNNY THING.

06:36.917 --> 06:38.750
WE ARE ALL ALONE
HERE TONIGHT.

06:38.750 --> 06:40.625
MMM.

06:43.583 --> 06:44.542
MMM.

06:48.250 --> 06:49.542
UM...

06:52.667 --> 06:54.041
YEAH.

06:54.041 --> 06:55.208
I'M SORRY.

06:55.208 --> 06:56.625
OH.

06:56.625 --> 06:57.583
OHH.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.250
NO, IT'S JUST THAT
I'M REALLY TIRED AND--

06:59.250 --> 07:02.041
YEAH, COOL.
THAT'S--TIRED.

07:02.041 --> 07:03.542
NO, BECAUSE WE COULD---
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

07:03.542 --> 07:06.000
I'M ONLY--
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
JUST...PSHH...NO.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.667
I'M JUST...
(LAUGHS)

07:10.625 --> 07:12.417
IT'S FINE.

07:12.417 --> 07:13.583
(SIGHS)

07:13.583 --> 07:15.583
(INHALES DEEPLY)

07:15.583 --> 07:16.750
HMM.

07:27.083 --> 07:28.667
PACEY!

07:35.083 --> 07:35.708
PACEY!

07:35.708 --> 07:36.667
YES! WHAT?
I DIDN'T DO IT.

07:36.667 --> 07:40.542
YOU STAYED UP AGAIN
ALL LAST NIGHT, HAVEN'T YOU?

07:40.542 --> 07:41.875
YES.

07:41.875 --> 07:44.250
AND YOU FINISHED
ALL THE COFFEE.

07:44.250 --> 07:46.125
OH!

07:46.125 --> 07:48.792
OK, YES. BUT THERE'S
MORE. WE HAVE PLENTY.

07:48.792 --> 07:50.250
AND YOU KNOW,
IT'S REALLY STRANGE.

07:50.250 --> 07:52.291
THAT THING THAT EVERYBODY
SAYS ABOUT IT BEING HARD
TO STAY UP ALL NIGHT--

07:52.291 --> 07:54.542
IT'S REALLY NOT. IT'S
JUST THAT HOUR FROM 4:00
TO 5:00 THAT GETS YOU.

07:54.542 --> 07:55.708
BUT YOU'D BE AMAZED
AT WHAT YOUR MIND
ACTUALLY RETAINS.

07:55.708 --> 07:59.458
I MEAN, I KNOW ALL
ABOUT MARKET OPTIONS,
EQUITY ACCOUNTS,

07:59.458 --> 08:01.375
NONCONVERTIBLE BONDS,
BUT YOU'D--
PACEY!

08:01.375 --> 08:02.625
YES?

08:02.625 --> 08:04.458
COFFEE!
I GOT IT.

08:04.458 --> 08:05.291
(WATER RUNNING)

08:05.291 --> 08:07.458
THAT'S NOT
YOUR BLOODY GIRLFRIEND

08:07.458 --> 08:07.583
IN THE SHOWER AGAIN,
IS IT?

08:11.583 --> 08:12.875
NOPE. THAT'S JACK.

08:25.500 --> 08:26.083
YES, WE DID.

WOKE UP ONE MORNING
AND HE WAS SUDDENLY GAY,

09:15.959 --> 09:19.083
IT'S NOT LIKE I WOULD
ACTUALLY GET INVOLVED
WITH THE GUY. COME ON.

09:19.083 --> 09:20.750

SORRY I'M LATE.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.667
BUT I SEE EXHIBITS
A, B, C, AND D HAVE ARRIVED,

09:29.667 --> 09:32.875
BY WHICH I MEAN, OF COURSE,
MY TEACHING ASSISTANTS,

09:32.875 --> 09:35.250
WHO MAY NOW BEGIN
THE ARDUOUS TASK

09:35.250 --> 09:36.625
OF HANDING YOU BACK
YOUR PAPERS.

YOU'D PREFER TO SIT HERE
FOR 50 MINUTES

09:47.375 --> 09:50.375
NO? NO,
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

09:50.375 --> 09:52.750
AS YOU KNOW,
THESE PAPERS REPRESENT
20% OF YOUR GRADE,

09:52.750 --> 09:55.834
MOST OF WHICH WERE
GRADED BY THE T.A.s,
OF COURSE.

09:55.834 --> 09:58.250
BUT I DID REVIEW
ALL THE GRADES
THOROUGHLY MYSELF,

09:58.250 --> 10:01.083
AND I AM PREPARED
TO DEAL WITH ANY
AND ALL SOB STORIES

10:01.083 --> 10:02.834
THAT MAY BE
COMING MY WAY.

10:02.834 --> 10:04.750

KEEP IN MIND
YEAH!

10:04.750 --> 10:06.291
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST
TIME I'VE HEARD THE ONE

10:06.291 --> 10:08.458
ABOUT HOW A B-PLUS IS
GONNA RUIN YOUR CHANCES
TURN IT OVER.

10:08.458 --> 10:10.792
OF GETTING INTO
A DECENT LAW SCHOOL.

10:10.792 --> 10:11.083
(LAUGHTER)

10:11.083 --> 10:13.542
(LAUGHS)

10:23.041 --> 10:24.583
SHOULD'VE
KEPT WALKIN'.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.458
HERE. LET ME.

10:26.458 --> 10:27.458
NOPE. I GOT IT.

10:27.458 --> 10:29.792
JUST TRYING TO BE NICE.
WELL, DON'T.

10:29.792 --> 10:32.583
I LIKED YOU A LOT BETTER
WHEN YOU WERE SURLY.

10:32.583 --> 10:33.917
I AM NOT--

10:36.417 --> 10:39.125
LOOK, I THINK THAT
WE HAVE BOTH BEEN ACTING

10:39.125 --> 10:41.166
A LITTLE IMMATURE
SINCE THE INCIDENT.

10:41.166 --> 10:43.125
I'VE  BEEN ACTING
IMMATURE?

10:45.041 --> 10:46.542
I KNOW THAT I  HAVE.

10:46.542 --> 10:47.834
DON'T DO THAT.

10:47.834 --> 10:50.625
DON'T BACK DOWN.
IF YOU DO THAT
IN CLASS TODAY,

10:50.625 --> 10:52.750
HETSON'S GONNA
EAT YOU ALIVE.

10:54.333 --> 10:57.125
I SEE, AND WHEN
WILL YOU BE GRACING US

10:57.125 --> 10:58.917
WITH YOUR
IN-CLASS PRESENTATION?

10:58.917 --> 11:01.750
YOU KNOW, IF YOU THINK
I'M BEING A JERK,
JUST TELL ME.

11:01.750 --> 11:04.250
AND HOW IS THAT
GONNA HELP US
GET ALONG ANY BETTER?

11:04.250 --> 11:06.458
OH, IT'S--IT'S NOT,
BUT LET'S NOT PRETEND

11:06.458 --> 11:08.208
THINGS ARE ALL NICE
WHEN THEY'RE NOT.

11:08.208 --> 11:09.667
THEY'RE NOT?

11:09.667 --> 11:13.458
NO. THE, UH, "INCIDENT,"
AS YOU SO CLINICALLY
REFER TO IT,

11:13.458 --> 11:16.208
WAS YOU KISSING ME
ON THE MOUTH

11:16.208 --> 11:18.291
WITH SOME SORT
OF TWISTED INTENT
WE'VE YET TO CLARIFY.

11:18.291 --> 11:21.250
AGREEABLE, YES,

11:21.250 --> 11:22.667
BUT HARDLY NICE.

11:22.667 --> 11:26.417
WHAT, SO NOW WE HAVE
TO GET INTO SOME SORT
OF SEMANTIC ARGUMENT?

11:27.708 --> 11:29.333
SO, YOU COMING
OR WHAT?

11:29.333 --> 11:30.500
WHAT, TO THE LIBRARY?

11:30.500 --> 11:31.917
YEAH. THAT'S
WHERE WE'RE HEADED.

11:31.917 --> 11:33.500
THAT'S WHERE
YOU  WERE HEADED.

11:33.500 --> 11:35.041
AND IF YOU'RE
STILL FEELING "NICE,"

11:35.041 --> 11:35.834
YOU MIGHT WANT TO HANG
SOME OF THESE UP
IN THERE.

11:49.333 --> 11:54.041
YEAH, WELL,
HE WANTS A NEW D.P.,
AND HE WANTS HIM NOW.

11:54.041 --> 11:55.834
IT'S NOT EVEN NOON,
AND SHE'S ALREADY FIRED
PEOPLE ON 3 CONTINENTS.

11:57.750 --> 11:58.708
3-EGG OMELET?

11:58.708 --> 12:00.208
ONE EGG,
2 EGG WHITES.

12:00.208 --> 12:01.667
LET'S DO IT.

12:02.542 --> 12:04.875
YEAH? WELL,
IF I KNEW THAT,

12:04.875 --> 12:06.041
THEN I'D  BE
THE ASSISTANT.

12:07.875 --> 12:10.667
LISTEN, SWEETIE,
I GOTTA GO.

12:10.667 --> 12:11.708
BREAKFAST
IS SERVED, LUV.

12:11.708 --> 12:13.166
I'M NOT GONNA
BEAT AROUND
THE BUSH, TODD.

12:13.166 --> 12:16.041
AS YOUR LITTLE FRIEND HERE
POINTED OUT LAST NIGHT,

12:16.041 --> 12:18.834
YOU'RE WAY BEHIND SCHEDULE
AND WAY OVER BUDGET,

12:18.834 --> 12:21.291
BOTH OF WHICH WE COULD
LIVE WITH IF THE FOOTAGE
WERE A DREAM.

12:21.291 --> 12:23.667
BUT WE HATE THE GIRL.

12:23.667 --> 12:25.041
NATASHA?

12:25.041 --> 12:27.041
NATASHA, NATALIE,
NADIA, WHATEVER.

12:27.041 --> 12:27.875
THE ONE
WITH THE NICE RACK.

12:27.875 --> 12:30.708
I KNOW YOU SAID
YOU COULD WORK WITH HER,

12:30.708 --> 12:34.083
BUT WE FIGURE WE
SHUT DOWN, WE RECAST--

12:34.083 --> 12:35.083
HOLD ON A BLOODY
MINUTE HERE!

12:35.083 --> 12:36.750
YES, SHE MIGHT'VE
BEEN A BIT UNPREPARED,

12:36.750 --> 12:39.208
BUT YOU DON'T
GO AND SHUT DOWN
AN ENTIRE PRODUCTION--

12:39.208 --> 12:40.625
SHE CAN DO THIS JOB.

12:41.750 --> 12:43.875
FOR A HORROR MOVIE
LIKE THIS TO WORK,

12:43.875 --> 12:46.333
THE HEROINE'S
GOTTA BE BOTH SEXY
AND INTELLIGENT.

12:46.333 --> 12:47.000
NATASHA IS  THAT GIRL.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.708
WHY DO I CARE
WHAT HE THINKS?

12:48.708 --> 12:50.625
HE IS  THE TARGET
DEMOGRAPHIC.

12:51.625 --> 12:53.083
SHOW HER
SOME CUT FOOTAGE.

12:53.083 --> 12:55.250
WE CAN PUT
SOME TOGETHER
BY THIS AFTERNOON.

12:55.250 --> 12:57.750
YOU REALLY THINK
THAT'S GONNA
CHANGE MY MIND?

12:57.750 --> 12:59.500
COULDN'T HURT.

13:01.917 --> 13:02.166
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

13:02.166 --> 13:04.125
YEAH?

13:12.583 --> 13:14.583
OK, WELL,
THIS HAS GOTTA BE
SOME KIND OF MISTAKE.

13:14.583 --> 13:16.959
I MEAN, MINE'S
HIGHER THAN YOURS.

13:16.959 --> 13:18.208
LOOKS THAT WAY.

13:18.208 --> 13:19.834
AND YOU'VE ACTUALLY
BEEN WORKING HARD
ALL SEMESTER.

13:19.834 --> 13:22.875
YEAH, WELL, APPARENTLY
NOT HARD ENOUGH.

13:26.375 --> 13:28.708
REAL NICE WORK.

13:29.500 --> 13:30.750
HI.

13:30.750 --> 13:32.291
DON'T TELL ME,
ANOTHER UNSATISFIED
CUSTOMER.

13:32.291 --> 13:35.458
I--I JUST, UM...

13:35.458 --> 13:37.542
HAD A QUESTION
ABOUT MY GRADE.

13:37.542 --> 13:39.750
UH, C-MINUS
SEEMS A LITTLE LOW

13:39.750 --> 13:41.625
FOR A PAPER
THAT YOU ENJOYED.

13:41.625 --> 13:43.041
I SAID THAT, DID I?

13:43.041 --> 13:44.834
YEAH, YOU DID
THE OTHER NIGHT.

13:44.834 --> 13:46.792
OF COURSE.

13:46.792 --> 13:49.458
UH, WHAT I MEANT WAS
I REALLY ENJOYED
THE CONTENT.

13:49.458 --> 13:52.959
YOUR GRASP OF STRUCTURE,
ON THE OTHER HAND,
IS QUITE RUDIMENTARY.

13:52.959 --> 13:55.834
I CAN RECOMMEND
A FEW BOOKS THAT
MIGHT HELP WITH THAT.

13:55.834 --> 13:59.250
HOWEVER, I DO HAVE
ANOTHER CLASS I NEED
TO GET TO RIGHT NOW.

14:00.917 --> 14:03.333
YEAH, SURE.

14:03.333 --> 14:06.417
YOU KNOW, A C-MINUS
REALLY ISN'T
ALL THAT BAD, JACK.

14:06.417 --> 14:09.166
YOU TOLD ME YOURSELF
YOU WEREN'T A VERY
MOTIVATED STUDENT.

14:09.166 --> 14:12.708
WELL, I GUESS I THOUGHT
I WAS DOIN' BETTER THIS TERM.

14:12.708 --> 14:15.375
WELL, MAYBE
YOUR EXPECTATIONS
WERE TOO HIGH.

14:20.166 --> 14:21.542
(SIGHS)

14:24.125 --> 14:25.291
SLOWER.

14:26.333 --> 14:27.542
SLOWER.

14:28.959 --> 14:30.208
(SHOUTS)

14:30.208 --> 14:32.375
CUT!
Man: CUT
ON REHEARSAL.

14:32.375 --> 14:34.750
CAN SOMEONE FIND LEERY
FOR ME, PLEASE?

14:34.750 --> 14:35.917
HERE.

14:35.917 --> 14:36.542
RIGHT HERE.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.875
SO, IS SHE GONE?

14:38.875 --> 14:41.375
SHE LEFT 15 MINUTES AGO
WITH DIRECTIONS
TO THE NEAREST GYM.

14:41.375 --> 14:43.542
GONNA MEET WITH HER
AND THE EDITOR WHEN
WE BREAK FOR LUNCH.

14:43.542 --> 14:45.375
TODD, HAIR AND MAKEUP'S
DONE WITH NATASHA. WE'RE
JUST WAITING ON CAMERA.

14:45.375 --> 14:46.875
THANKS.

14:46.875 --> 14:50.166
JUST THE CHANCE
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.

14:50.166 --> 14:50.875
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO?

14:50.875 --> 14:52.667
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I'M GONNA DO?

14:52.667 --> 14:55.125
FAVORITE PART
OF THE JOB, MATE.

14:55.125 --> 14:56.208
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

14:56.208 --> 14:58.208
COURSE I DO.
NOTHING'S AS MUCH FUN

14:58.208 --> 14:59.041
AS EXPLAINING
TO THE OVERPAID HAIRDOS

14:59.041 --> 15:01.458
HOW IMMINENTLY REPLACEABLE
THEY ALL ARE.

15:01.458 --> 15:02.333
I THOUGHT
YOU LIKED HER.

15:02.333 --> 15:03.500
I DO.

15:03.500 --> 15:04.834
NOT AS MUCH AS YOU DO,
OF COURSE,

15:04.834 --> 15:05.959
WHICH MAY BE
CLOUDING YOUR JUDGMENT
ON THIS MATTER.

15:05.959 --> 15:09.000
POINT TAKEN,
BUT HOW IS YELLIN'
AT HER GONNA HELP?

15:09.000 --> 15:11.333
I MEAN, IF YOU DESTROY
HER CONFIDENCE, THE DAY'S
NOT GONNA GO ANY FASTER.

15:11.333 --> 15:14.041
LISTEN, MATE,
LET ME LET YOU IN
ON A LITTLE SECRET.

15:14.041 --> 15:15.792
2-BIT HORROR MOVIES
THAT GET SHUT DOWN
ONE WEEK INTO PRODUCTION?

15:15.792 --> 15:18.875
THEY DON'T ALWAYS
GET STARTED UP AGAIN.

15:18.875 --> 15:20.333
AND AS SOMEONE
WHO WORKS FOR ME,

15:20.333 --> 15:22.041
MY CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT
MIGHT BE OF SOME INTEREST
TO YOU.

15:22.041 --> 15:23.834
SO YOU'D FIRE HER
JUST LIKE THAT.

15:23.834 --> 15:24.917
IF IT WAS A CHOICE
BETWEEN HER AND ME.

15:24.917 --> 15:27.208
THAT'D BE DEAD EASY
NOW, WOULDN'T IT?

15:27.208 --> 15:28.417
TODD.

15:28.417 --> 15:29.959
THEY NEED YOU
AT CAMERA.

15:29.959 --> 15:32.500
THIS DISCUSSION
IS NOT OVER.

15:35.625 --> 15:36.625
Todd:
'SCUSE ME.

15:42.083 --> 15:44.250
I THOUGHT
I HAD 5 MINUTES.

15:44.250 --> 15:45.375
OOH!
UM--SORRY.

15:45.375 --> 15:46.667
HA HA HA!

15:46.667 --> 15:49.583
BLACK BRA, WHITE SHIRT.

15:49.583 --> 15:51.750
NEVER A GOOD IDEA.

15:52.834 --> 15:53.792
SO, I, UM...

15:55.250 --> 15:57.125
I HEARD TODD
WANTS TO TALK WITH ME.

15:57.125 --> 15:58.417
UH, YEAH.
IT'S, UH...

15:58.417 --> 16:00.458
ABOUT THIS SHOT.

16:02.417 --> 16:03.625
WHAT, IT'S COMPLICATED?

16:03.625 --> 16:06.667
WELL, HE...LIKES
TO MOVE THE CAMERA.

16:06.667 --> 16:08.708
YEAH, SO I NOTICED.

16:08.708 --> 16:10.917
SO, UM...

16:10.917 --> 16:13.375
WHO'S THAT WOMAN
YOU GUYS WERE TALKING
TO THIS MORNING?

16:13.375 --> 16:15.667
SHE'S THE, UH,
EXECUTIVE IN CHARGE
OF PRODUCTION.

16:15.667 --> 16:18.458
SHE'S WORRIED ABOUT
ALL THE OVERTIME.

16:18.458 --> 16:19.875
COOL.

16:20.792 --> 16:23.333
IS SOMETHING WRONG, DAWSON?

16:23.333 --> 16:26.834
NO, NOTHIN', OTHER
THAN YOU BEING NAKED
WHEN I WALKED IN.

16:27.583 --> 16:29.542
SUCH A PRUDE.

16:31.166 --> 16:33.000
IF WE'RE GONNA WORK TOGETHER,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LEARN

16:33.000 --> 16:34.291
TO GET OVER THINGS
LIKE THAT.

16:34.291 --> 16:35.875
ALL RIGHT. WELL, YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE TO LEARN

16:35.875 --> 16:37.458
HOW TO NOT LEAVE
EVERY ROOM I WALK INTO.

16:37.458 --> 16:41.041
OK, SO WE BOTH HAVE ROOM
FOR IMPROVEMENT.

16:46.208 --> 16:48.291
I KNOW I'M IN THE DOGHOUSE.

16:50.250 --> 16:51.250
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT?

16:51.500 --> 16:54.166
LOOK...

16:54.166 --> 16:55.875
TODD'S NOT
THE BEST COMMUNICATOR,

16:55.875 --> 16:58.000
AND HE'S NOT EXACTLY
A TOUCHY-FEELY
KIND OF GUY.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.458
A GIRL CAN TELL.

16:59.458 --> 17:02.500
THAT'S WHY I REALLY NEED
TO NAIL THIS BIG SCENE
TONIGHT.

17:02.500 --> 17:03.041
HELP ME?

17:03.041 --> 17:05.208
MY BEST FRIEND'S DYING,

17:05.208 --> 17:07.416
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE THINKING.

17:07.416 --> 17:09.333
DON'T  THINK.

17:09.333 --> 17:11.333
YOUR BEST FRIEND'S
DYING. WHAT
ARE YOU GONNA DO?

17:11.333 --> 17:12.333
I DON'T KNOW.

17:14.208 --> 17:14.834
SAVE HER? COMFORT HER?

17:14.834 --> 17:16.959
AND IF
THAT DOESN'T WORK?

17:17.916 --> 17:19.000
SAVE MYSELF?

17:19.000 --> 17:21.416
EXACTLY. IT'S--
DON'T THINK. JUST ACT.

17:21.416 --> 17:22.625
JUST--AND WHEN TODD
ASKS YOU TO JUMP...

17:22.625 --> 17:23.834
ASK HOW HIGH.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.375
AND HOW FAR.

17:25.375 --> 17:27.208
ALWAYS BE AWARE
WHERE THE CAMERA IS.

17:27.208 --> 17:28.541
THAT'S HOW YOU
COMMUNICATE WITH HIM.

17:28.541 --> 17:30.417
(SIGHS) YOU REALLY THINK
THAT'S GONNA WORK?

17:31.542 --> 17:32.792
THEY'RE READY
FOR YOU, NATASHA.

17:37.041 --> 17:37.333
GUARANTEE IT.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.500
THANK YOU.

17:45.750 --> 17:46.875
Pacey: YOU'RE
KIDDIN' ME, RIGHT?

17:46.875 --> 17:50.166
I MEAN, STAN, LOOK,
I'M AS RISK-ADVERSE
AS THE NEXT GUY,

17:50.166 --> 17:51.458
BUT YOU'RE JUST QUITTIN'.

17:51.458 --> 17:53.375
Y-YOU'RE NOT EVEN KEEPIN' UP
WITH THE INFLATION,

17:53.375 --> 17:54.125
AND, STAN,
ALL I'M ASKIN' FOR

17:54.125 --> 17:58.458
IS A HINT OF
YOUR INTEREST, AND I W--

17:58.458 --> 18:02.250
UH...YOU KNOW WHAT, STAN?
I'M GONNA HAVE TO CALL
YOU BACK ON THIS,

18:02.250 --> 18:05.375
BUT I WILL  BE IN TOUCH,
BECAUSE, BELIEVE ME, THIS
IS GONNA BE A HOT ISSUE.

18:07.875 --> 18:09.000
AH! THERE YOU ARE.
FINALLY!

18:09.000 --> 18:11.750
THAT MEAN
RECEPTIONIST
WAS--
AUDREY.

18:11.750 --> 18:13.083
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

18:13.083 --> 18:15.250
NO HELLO?
NO SMOOCH?

18:15.250 --> 18:17.291
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU
IT TOOK ME FOREVER
TO GET PAST THE--

18:17.291 --> 18:18.250
HONEY. WE CAN'T
DO THIS HERE.

18:20.500 --> 18:21.333
GET A ROOM,
WITTER.

18:21.333 --> 18:24.708
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
THANKS FOR THE TIP.

18:24.708 --> 18:26.208
OK, LET'S GO
TO THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

18:26.208 --> 18:27.500
BYE, EVERYONE.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.708
(HUMMING)
AUDREY.

18:32.708 --> 18:35.250
YOU REALLY CAN'T
JUST POP IN
LIKE THIS.

18:35.250 --> 18:37.458
WELL, WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO, PACEY?

18:37.458 --> 18:38.834
YOU WON'T TAKE
ANY OF MY PHONE CALLS.

18:38.834 --> 18:39.667
BECAUSE I'M AT WORK.

18:39.667 --> 18:41.708
AND WHEN I'M AT WORK,
I'M ON THE PHONE,

18:41.708 --> 18:43.250
WHICH MAKES IT
PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT
FOR ME

18:43.250 --> 18:44.625
TO TAKE OTHER CALLS.

18:44.625 --> 18:46.667
IN FACT, I SHOULDN'T
BE IN HERE RIGHT NOW.
I SHOULD BE OUTSIDE...

18:46.667 --> 18:48.500
ON THE PHONE.

18:48.500 --> 18:49.792
I GET IT.

18:49.792 --> 18:51.250
OK, PLEASE
DON'T BE MAD AT ME.
PLEASE? PLEASE?

18:51.250 --> 18:54.250
THE ABSOLUTE BEST THING
IN THE WORLD HAS HAPPENED,

18:54.250 --> 18:56.208
AND I WOULDN'T
HAVE COME BY IF IT
WEREN'T COMPLETELY MAJOR.

18:57.500 --> 18:58.291
HOW MAJOR?

18:58.291 --> 19:01.792
EMMA HAS ASKED ME
TO BE IN HER BAND.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.458
ME. FOR REAL.
I MEAN, WELL,

19:03.458 --> 19:05.542
IT'S SORT OF
ON A TRIAL BASIS,
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,

19:05.542 --> 19:06.875
BASICALLY SHE
STILL CAN'T STAND ME

19:06.875 --> 19:09.083
AND SHE THINKS I ATE
ALL OF HER BASMATI RICE
OR WHATEVER,

19:09.083 --> 19:11.291
BUT WE HAVE BEEN
REHEARSING ALL DAY,

19:11.291 --> 19:12.834
AND WE HAVE A GIG TONIGHT
AT HELL'S KITCHEN.

19:12.834 --> 19:13.583
THAT'S GREAT.

19:13.583 --> 19:15.875
I KNOW! IT IS!

19:15.875 --> 19:17.750
WHICH IS WHY
I HAD TO COME HERE

19:17.750 --> 19:20.542
AND COERCE YOU INTO
COMING OUT THIS EVENING.

19:20.542 --> 19:22.500
HONEY, I NEED YOU THERE.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.291
IT'S KINDA
LIKE MY AUDITION, AND,
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND,

19:24.291 --> 19:27.041
EMMA IS A LITTLE BIT
OF A TEMPERAMENTAL
CONTROL FREAK

19:27.041 --> 19:28.375
WHEN IT COMES
TO HER BAND.
SAY NO MORE.

19:28.375 --> 19:30.333
YOU'RE GONNA COME?
I WILL,
JUST SO LONG AS--

19:30.333 --> 19:31.625
I'M LEAVING.

19:31.625 --> 19:33.333
OK.

19:33.667 --> 19:35.333
BYE.

19:37.166 --> 19:39.375
THE GAMES CONTINUE,
AND, OF COURSE,

19:39.375 --> 19:42.500
CULMINATE IN THE EXPLANATION
OF THE CRYPTOGRAMMIC PAPER.

19:42.500 --> 19:44.500
STOP.

19:44.500 --> 19:47.083
I'M SO BORED,
I'M LOSING MY PULSE
HERE, POTTER.

19:48.667 --> 19:50.000
WHEN HUMBERT GETS CALLED AWAY
FOR THE URGENT PHONE CALL,

19:50.000 --> 19:54.083
HE RETURNS TO FIND LOLITA
DOING WHAT WITH THE LIKES
OF CLARE QUILTY?

19:54.083 --> 19:54.750
PLAYING TENNIS.

19:54.750 --> 19:56.667
WHAT KIND OF TENNIS?

20:01.500 --> 20:03.166
GOOD TENNIS?

20:03.166 --> 20:03.750
POTTER!

20:03.750 --> 20:06.000
OH, YOU DISAPPOINT ME.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.208
HOW ARE WE EVER GONNA
LEARN ANYTHING TODAY

20:07.208 --> 20:08.708
WHEN THE PERSON WHO'S
SUPPOSED TO BE TEACHING US

20:08.708 --> 20:11.333
HASN'T EVEN
READ THE BOOK? SOMEBODY?

20:12.875 --> 20:15.000
ANYBODY?

20:18.166 --> 20:19.834
EDDIE.

20:19.834 --> 20:21.834
OF COURSE EDDIE.

20:21.834 --> 20:26.000
EDDIE ALWAYS KNOWS.
I MEAN, RARELY VOLUNTEERS,
BUT ALWAYS KNOWS.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.834
SO, PLEASE,
ENLIGHTEN US.

20:27.834 --> 20:29.375
DOUBLES.

20:29.375 --> 20:31.959
TOLD YOU.
ALWAYS KNOWS.

20:31.959 --> 20:35.542
AND THANK GOD HE'S HERE
TO PICK UP THE SLACK
FOR MISS POTTER, WHO...

20:35.542 --> 20:37.667
MAY NOW RETURN
TO BORING US TO DEATH.

20:37.667 --> 20:40.625
HEY, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE IF YOU LAID OFF HER
FOR 2 SECONDS AT A TIME,

20:40.625 --> 20:42.166
SHE MIGHT
NOT BE SO NERVOUS.

20:45.375 --> 20:46.250
WHAT WAS THAT?

20:46.250 --> 20:49.542
A LITTLE CRITICISM
OF MY TEACHING TECHNIQUES?

20:49.542 --> 20:52.708
BECAUSE I HAVE TO SAY
I'VE ALWAYS CONSIDERED
MYSELF PRETTY LENIENT,

20:52.708 --> 20:55.542
PRETTY WILLING
TO OVERLOOK CERTAIN THINGS

20:55.542 --> 20:59.417
THAT OTHER, MORE TRADITIONAL,
BY-THE-BOOK TEACHERS
MIGHT NOT APPRECIATE.

20:59.792 --> 21:02.333
WHATEVER.

21:02.333 --> 21:04.583
OH, YOU DON'T AGREE?

21:04.583 --> 21:05.792
(LAUGHS)

21:05.792 --> 21:07.500
I'M READY TO MAKE THIS
A LARGER DISCUSSION

21:07.500 --> 21:10.250
ANY TIME YOU ARE.
IN FACT, I'VE BEEN READY
FOR WEEKS NOW.

21:10.250 --> 21:13.375
Joey: AM I TEACHING HERE
OR WHAT? BECAUSE...

21:13.375 --> 21:15.917
THE DOUBLES THING IS
ACTUALLY VERY IMPORTANT.

21:15.917 --> 21:17.375
I KNOW.

21:17.375 --> 21:19.166
THAT'S WHY
I BROUGHT IT UP.

21:19.166 --> 21:21.250
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
ANOTHER CHANCE
TO REDEEM YOURSELF.

21:21.250 --> 21:25.250
CIRCA 1940, A WELL-KNOWN
RUSSIAN EMIGRE WRITER
NAMED VLADIMIR SIRIN

21:25.250 --> 21:26.291
CEASES TO EXIST.

21:26.291 --> 21:27.792
WHY?

21:32.625 --> 21:34.667
S-I-R-I-N.

21:34.667 --> 21:37.125
NO IDEA?

21:37.125 --> 21:40.708
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD ASK
YOUR ALWAYS-MUCH-BETTER-
INFORMED DOPPELGANGER.

21:40.708 --> 21:42.125
EDDIE.

21:42.125 --> 21:42.792
BECAUSE HE NEVER EXISTED
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

21:42.792 --> 21:44.792
NEVER EXISTED!

21:44.792 --> 21:47.083
YOU MEAN HE WAS
A SHADOW? A SHADE?

21:47.083 --> 21:48.166
A DOUBLE, PERHAPS?

21:48.166 --> 21:50.792
SOMEONE
PASSING HIMSELF OFF
AS SOMEONE ELSE?

21:50.792 --> 21:52.500
YEAH, YOU COULD SAY THAT,
OR YOU COULD JUST SAY
IT WAS A PEN NAME.

21:52.500 --> 21:57.000
YOU COULD, BUT
IT'S SECRET IDENTITY,
NONETHELESS.

21:58.250 --> 22:00.959
I'M SORRY.
THIS SEEMS A LITTLE...

22:00.959 --> 22:03.250
OFF-TOPIC FOR YOU?

22:03.250 --> 22:07.125
NO. I'M JUST SAYING
I GET THE POINT.

22:07.125 --> 22:08.750
AH.

22:08.750 --> 22:10.291
BUT DO THE REST OF THEM?

22:10.291 --> 22:11.834
DO THEY NEED TO?

22:11.834 --> 22:13.792
YOU  TELL  ME.

22:15.792 --> 22:17.667
PERSONALLY, I THINK
THE QUESTION IS MOOT.

22:17.667 --> 22:21.667
BUT IF IT REALLY
BOTHERS YOU THAT MUCH,
I'LL GO.

22:38.583 --> 22:39.792
OH, WELL, DON'T JUST
STAND THERE, POTTER. CARRY ON.

22:39.792 --> 22:42.875
IN A MINUTE.

22:43.667 --> 22:44.625
DID YOU JUST SAY
WHAT I THINK YOU SAID?

22:44.625 --> 22:46.959
YES.

22:50.667 --> 22:52.667
HEY. WAIT UP.

22:52.667 --> 22:54.166
OH, ARE YOU
LEAVING, TOO?

22:54.166 --> 22:55.166
NO, YOU'RE COMING BACK.

22:55.166 --> 22:56.792
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
JUST HAPPENED BACK THERE,

22:56.792 --> 22:58.834
BUT YOU CAN'T BACK DOWN
FROM HIM WHEN HE--
YOU'RE RIGHT.

22:58.834 --> 23:01.083
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
JUST HAPPENED BACK THERE,
SO IN THAT CASE,

23:01.083 --> 23:04.375
MAYBE THE BEST THING
FOR YOU TO DO IS JUST
MIND YOUR OWN DAMN BUSINESS.

23:12.667 --> 23:16.125
WELL, HE'S NOT HERE.
HE MUST NOT BE
WORKING TONIGHT.

23:16.125 --> 23:17.542
HE WORKS
EVERY NIGHT.

23:17.542 --> 23:19.375
WELL, NOT THIS ONE.

23:20.208 --> 23:21.208
WELL, YOU DON'T
HAPPEN TO KNOW

23:21.208 --> 23:23.750
WHERE HE LIVES,
DO YOU?

23:23.750 --> 23:26.250
FLAT SOMEWHERE.
TAKE YOU,
LIKE, 2 HOURS

23:26.250 --> 23:27.917
TO GET THERE
ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT.

23:27.917 --> 23:29.500
YOU MEAN HE DOESN'T
LIVE ON CAMPUS?

23:29.500 --> 23:31.417
WHICH ONE?
WORTHINGTON?

23:31.417 --> 23:34.041
WELL, WHY
WOULD HE LIVE ON THE
WORTHINGTON CAMPUS?

23:36.750 --> 23:37.875
UM, NO REASON.

23:37.875 --> 23:39.417
YOU DIDN'T THINK
HE'S A STUDENT,
DID YOU?

23:39.417 --> 23:42.041
I MEAN, I KNOW
HE READS A LOT.

23:42.041 --> 23:44.375
YEAH, HE DOES. UM...
YOU DON'T THINK

23:44.375 --> 23:46.917
THEY'D HAVE HIS ADDRESS
ON FILE IN THE BACK,
DO YOU?

23:46.917 --> 23:48.583
PROBABLY.

23:48.583 --> 23:50.291
THANKS. AND
I'LL BE BACK
TO CLOSE,

23:50.291 --> 23:53.333
AND GOOD LUCK
TONIGHT
WITH THE GIG.

23:53.333 --> 23:54.750
THANK YOU.

23:54.750 --> 23:57.208
GOT A BIT OF A SURPRISE
FOR YOU, ACTUALLY.

23:57.208 --> 23:58.542
REALLY!

24:02.917 --> 24:04.333
Natasha, on film:
SOMEBODY!
(POUNDING ON DOOR)

24:04.333 --> 24:07.583
SOMEBODY,
PLEASE HELP ME!

24:07.583 --> 24:08.792
HELP!

24:10.750 --> 24:12.083
WELL...

24:12.083 --> 24:13.291
THAT CONSTITUTES
IMPROVEMENT.

24:13.291 --> 24:16.583
ADEQUATE
INSTEAD OF ABYSMAL.

24:16.583 --> 24:17.583
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

24:17.583 --> 24:19.375
GET ME CHATSWORTH.

24:19.375 --> 24:20.583
I MEAN, COME ON.

24:20.583 --> 24:22.959
IS SHE SUPPOSED
TO BE LOOKING DOWN
AT THE GROUND LIKE THAT,

24:22.959 --> 24:25.125
OR DID SHE JUST NOT KNOW
WHERE HER MARKS ARE?

24:25.125 --> 24:27.625
NEW YORK, L.A.,
I DON'T CARE!

24:27.625 --> 24:29.208
SHE BARELY
EVEN WATCHED IT.

24:29.208 --> 24:30.792
YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT,
BUT EXACTLY WHOSE JOB

24:30.792 --> 24:32.208
ARE YOU TRYIN'
TO SAVE HERE?

24:32.208 --> 24:33.125
EVERYONE'S.

24:33.125 --> 24:34.792
LOOK, THE WORST
POSSIBLE THING
THAT HAPPENS,

24:34.792 --> 24:36.208
YOU GET SHUT DOWN.
RIGHT?

24:36.208 --> 24:38.291
SO YOU GOTTA GET HER
TO WATCH IT AGAIN,
AND THIS TIME,

24:38.291 --> 24:39.375
HIGHLIGHT NATASHA'S
STRENGTHS INSTEAD
OF HER WEAKNESSES.

24:39.375 --> 24:42.458
USE THAT CLOSEUP.
AND CHANGE THAT MUSIC.

24:42.917 --> 24:43.917
DO IT.

24:43.917 --> 24:46.375
FAST.

24:46.375 --> 24:48.333
AND...YOU STAY HERE.

24:48.333 --> 24:49.583
WHAT'S NEEDED NOW IS
SOME COOL PROFESSIONALISM.

24:51.417 --> 24:51.834
RIGHT.

24:51.834 --> 24:54.583
ALL RIGHT.

24:54.583 --> 24:55.041
FINE. I'LL HOLD.

24:55.041 --> 24:57.333
HEATHER, LUV.

24:57.333 --> 24:58.125
YES?

24:58.125 --> 24:59.125
HOW ABOUT WE DISCUSS
THIS RATIONALLY

24:59.125 --> 25:01.792
BEFORE YOU THROW OUT
SEVERAL THOUSAND
FEET OF FILM?

25:01.792 --> 25:02.834
RATIONAL?

25:02.834 --> 25:04.500
RATIONAL, LIKE
THE TIME YOU TOOK ME

25:04.500 --> 25:07.250
TO BERMUDA WITH YOU
AND DUMPED ME FOR
AN EXOTIC DANCE INSTRUCTOR?

25:07.250 --> 25:09.875
LOOK, THERE'S NO REASON
TO GET PERSONAL ABOUT IT.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

25:09.875 --> 25:11.583
YOU'RE ENGAGED NOW.
WORKING ON A FILM

25:11.583 --> 25:13.000
THAT'S ABOUT
TO BE SHUT DOWN...

25:13.000 --> 25:14.458
BY ME

25:14.458 --> 25:15.291
AND QUITE POSSIBLY

25:15.291 --> 25:17.583
NEVER STARTED UP AGAIN.

25:17.583 --> 25:18.542
STILL HOLDING.

25:18.542 --> 25:20.917
LOOK! YOU SIGNED OFF ON
THIS GIRL, DID YOU NOT?

25:20.917 --> 25:24.500
IT WASN'T SOME OTHER
PRADA-WEARING NIGHTMARE
I ACCIDENTALLY SHAGGED!

25:24.500 --> 25:26.834
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
I SIGNED OFF
ON THIS GIRL

25:26.834 --> 25:29.333
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
YOU COULD GET
A PERFORMANCE OUT OF HER.

25:29.333 --> 25:30.333
AND HE DID. YOU JUST
HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET.

25:30.333 --> 25:31.417
SCOTT?

25:39.333 --> 25:41.875
SOMEBODY,
PLEASE HELP ME!

25:42.166 --> 25:43.875
SOMEBODY!

25:46.041 --> 25:47.041
HELP ME!

25:47.041 --> 25:48.500
SOMEBODY!

25:48.500 --> 25:50.542
SOMEBODY,
HELP ME! PLEASE!

25:50.542 --> 25:52.041
PLEASE! SOMEBODY,
PLEASE HELP ME!

25:52.041 --> 25:54.542
BETTER, NO?

25:54.542 --> 25:56.375
BEFORE IT WAS
ALL ABOUT THE LOCATION,

25:56.375 --> 25:59.333
WHEREAS NOW
IT'S LIKE WE'RE ALONE
WITH HER AND HER FEAR.

25:59.333 --> 26:00.959
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

26:00.959 --> 26:02.708
YOUR JOB COULD BE
ON THE LINE HERE,
TOO, YOU KNOW.

26:05.875 --> 26:10.542
WELL, I THINK
YOUR LITTLE FRIEND HERE
MAKES A GOOD POINT.

26:16.542 --> 26:17.708
COME ON.

26:19.542 --> 26:20.708
(EXHALES)

26:29.291 --> 26:30.625
JACK. SORRY.
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYBODY
ELSE WAS OUT THERE.

26:30.625 --> 26:33.583
YEAH. MUST, UH...
MUST TAKE A WHILE

26:33.583 --> 26:35.917
TO GET
TO THE END OF ALL
YOUR ADORING FANS.

26:38.083 --> 26:38.959
SO, WHAT CAN I
HELP YOU WITH?

26:38.959 --> 26:42.250
LOOK, I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THIS ALL DAY.

26:42.250 --> 26:44.500
UH, THERE'S JUST ONE
MORE THING I GOTTA ASK
YOU ABOUT THIS PAPER.

26:44.500 --> 26:46.125
SURE.

26:46.125 --> 26:48.708
IF I HADN'T
BEEN SO SHOCKED

26:48.708 --> 26:51.625
ABOUT WHAT
YOU SAID TO ME
THE OTHER NIGHT,

26:51.625 --> 26:54.166
WOULD THIS C-MINUS
HAVE BEEN ANY HIGHER?

26:54.166 --> 26:56.500
LOW BLOW.

26:56.500 --> 26:57.708
YEAH, 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,

26:57.708 --> 26:59.667
I'M JUST TRYIN' TO MAKE
AN INFORMED DECISION
HERE,

26:59.667 --> 27:01.750
AND IF THAT'S WHAT
THIS IS ALL ABOUT,
HELL, ASK ME AGAIN,

27:01.750 --> 27:03.583
'CAUSE I JUST MIGHT
SAY YES THIS TIME.

27:03.583 --> 27:05.750
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY. UM...

27:05.750 --> 27:07.542
SOMETIMES PEOPLE READ
TOO MUCH INTO THINGS.

27:07.542 --> 27:08.625
TOO MUCH?
HOW ABOUT TOO LITTLE?

27:08.625 --> 27:10.250
'CAUSE I'M TOTALLY
WILLIN' TO GO THROUGH--

27:10.250 --> 27:12.875
I GET IT.
I GET YOUR POINT.

27:12.875 --> 27:16.834
YOU KNOW,
IT'S ONE THING TO BE
SOME SCARED TEENAGER,

27:16.834 --> 27:18.959
AFRAID OF HIS--
HIS FRIENDS, HIS FAMILY,

27:18.959 --> 27:20.959
AFRAID OF WHAT EVERYBODY
HE MEETS MIGHT THINK
AND SAY ABOUT HIM.

27:20.959 --> 27:24.291
YOU KNOW,
I CAN FORGIVE THAT.
HELL, I CAN EXPECT THAT.

27:24.291 --> 27:26.333
BUT YOU,
YOU'RE AN ADULT.

27:26.333 --> 27:27.333
OK, SOMEBODY'S
MARRIED TO YOU.
YOU'RE--

27:27.333 --> 27:29.291
YOU'RE RUINING LIVES
HERE ON A MUCH
LARGER SCALE.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.834
WHAT CAN I SAY?

27:32.834 --> 27:35.041
NOT EVERYONE'S
WILLING TO MAKE SACRIFICES

27:35.041 --> 27:36.875
FOR SOME SORT
OF POLITICAL AGENDA.

27:36.875 --> 27:39.125
NOT EVERYBODY'S WILLING
TO SPEND THEIR LIVES

27:39.125 --> 27:42.125
BEING PART
OF A DESPISED MINORITY.

27:42.125 --> 27:43.834
YEAH.

27:43.834 --> 27:45.625
(LAUGHS)

27:45.625 --> 27:46.834
WELL...

27:46.834 --> 27:49.959
THAT'S TRUE.

27:49.959 --> 27:52.792
BUT MAYBE YOU SHOULD
ASK YOURSELF WHO'S
DOIN' THE DESPISING.

28:04.667 --> 28:06.500
SO YOU CHECKED. I MEAN,
HE'S OUT THERE, RIGHT?

28:06.500 --> 28:07.708
WELL,
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE.

28:07.708 --> 28:09.083
IT'S--IT'S KIND OF
TOO CROWDED TO TELL.

28:09.083 --> 28:11.625
HOW CROWDED?

28:11.625 --> 28:12.834
WAY CROWDED.

28:12.834 --> 28:14.875
WHY? ARE YOU OK?
YOU'RE NOT SCARED,
ARE YOU?

28:14.875 --> 28:17.667
NO! GOD, NO.
WHY WOULD I BE SCARED?

28:17.667 --> 28:19.834
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU J--YOU JUST--
YOU SEEM SORT OF TENSE.

28:19.834 --> 28:21.250
I'M FINE.

28:21.250 --> 28:24.041
HEY. UM...ABOUT
THE OTHER NIGHT.

28:24.041 --> 28:25.333
WHAT OTHER NIGHT?

28:25.333 --> 28:28.625
WHEN WE GOT
REALLY DRUNK.

28:28.625 --> 28:30.458
YOU KNOW WHAT?

28:30.458 --> 28:32.875
TO BE HONEST-TO-GOD
TRUTHFUL WITH YOU, JEN,

28:32.875 --> 28:35.417
I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER
THAT AT ALL, SO--

28:35.417 --> 28:38.750
OK, LADIES, ENOUGH
CHECKIN' YOUR MAKEUP.

28:38.750 --> 28:41.208
I THINK THE CROWD'S
SUITABLY DRUNK BY NOW.

28:41.208 --> 28:42.000
DOES THAT MEAN
THAT WE'RE ON?

28:43.917 --> 28:46.000
IT DOES.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.208
HEY. THE PIERCINGS
ARE A NICE TOUCH,
BY THE WAY.

28:48.208 --> 28:49.458
THANK YOU!

28:49.458 --> 28:50.959
SCREW THIS UP,
AND I'LL KILL YOU.

28:50.959 --> 28:52.583
OK. SURE.

28:54.708 --> 28:57.208
UM...HEY, EVERYBODY.

28:57.208 --> 28:58.834
WE ARE THE HELL'S BELLES,

28:58.834 --> 29:02.166
AND WE THOUGHT WE WOULD PLAY
A FEW SONGS FOR YOU NOW,

29:02.166 --> 29:03.708
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING...

29:03.708 --> 29:04.750
SOOTHING,

29:04.750 --> 29:06.166
SOMETHING RELAXING,

29:06.166 --> 29:07.166
SOMETHING...

29:07.166 --> 29:08.041
(DRUM BEAT)

29:10.083 --> 29:12.417

WHAT THE HELL
YOU DOING HERE?

30:00.458 --> 30:02.542
GOD, YOU SCARED ME.

30:02.542 --> 30:03.583
YEAH, OBVIOUSLY.

30:03.583 --> 30:06.083
I ASKED YOU
A QUESTION.

30:06.083 --> 30:09.125
I JUST WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
IN CLASS TODAY.

30:09.125 --> 30:12.917
YEAH, WELL, SINCE
I'M NOT REALLY IN
THAT CLASS ANYMORE--

30:12.917 --> 30:15.959
LOOK, I KNOW.
I GET IT, OK?

30:15.959 --> 30:18.834
I GET THAT YOU'RE
NOT REALLY A STUDENT.

30:18.834 --> 30:20.166
YOU GET THAT, DO YOU?

30:20.166 --> 30:24.708
YEAH. I MEAN,
I DON'T REALLY GET
WHAT IT WAS ALL FOR, BUT--

30:26.792 --> 30:29.041
YOU KNOW,
I'VE COME A LONG WAY.

30:29.041 --> 30:31.041
MAYBE YOU COULD
JUST GIVE ME A GLASS
OF WATER OR SOMETHING?

30:44.125 --> 30:48.417
SO, MY PRESENTATION
ACTUALLY WENT OK
AFTER YOU LEFT.

30:48.417 --> 30:50.000
I MEAN, I JUST WENT
IN THERE, AND I--

30:50.000 --> 30:54.500
MM-HMM. CONGRATULATIONS,
JOEY. I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.

30:54.500 --> 30:56.000
YEAH. I'M SURE
YOU'RE ONLY SECONDS AWAY

30:56.000 --> 30:58.208
FROM BREAKING THROUGH
HETSON'S CRUSTY EXTERIOR,

30:58.208 --> 31:02.000
EARNING HIS UNDYING
RESPECT, AND GRADUATING
MAGNA CUM LAUDE.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.959
OR YOU COULD JUST SAVE
YOURSELF A LOT OF TROUBLE

31:03.959 --> 31:04.959
AND SLEEP WITH THE MAN.

31:04.959 --> 31:07.667
IS IT JUST ME, OR DO
YOU REACT THIS NICELY

31:07.667 --> 31:08.125
TO EVERYBODY WHO'S
TRYING TO HELP YOU?

31:10.708 --> 31:12.000
WHAT? NO RESPONSE?

31:12.000 --> 31:13.041
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
GIVE ME A SECOND HERE.

31:13.041 --> 31:16.875
I'M STILL TRYING TO PROCESS
THE CONDESCENDING NOTION

31:16.875 --> 31:18.375
THAT HELP
IS ACTUALLY REQUIRED.

31:18.375 --> 31:20.417
OH, YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S POSSIBLE
I COULD UNDERSTAND?

31:20.417 --> 31:22.917
NO, I DON'T.

31:22.917 --> 31:25.000
LOOK, JOEY, I'M SORRY
I DIDN'T TURN OUT

31:25.000 --> 31:26.417
TO BE THE PERSON
YOU THOUGHT I WAS,

31:26.417 --> 31:29.250
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
PROBABLY NOT TOO WISE

31:29.250 --> 31:31.291
TO INVEST THAT MUCH
IN PEOPLE YOU BARELY KNOW.

31:31.291 --> 31:32.750
OH, I HAVEN'T INVESTED
ANYTHING IN YOU.

31:32.750 --> 31:36.208
OH, YEAH?
THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE?

31:36.208 --> 31:38.875
SEE, IT SEEMS TO ME
THAT YOU'RE WASTING
VALUABLE TIME

31:38.875 --> 31:41.458
THAT WOULD BE BETTER SPENT
TRYING TO GET BACK

31:41.458 --> 31:43.041
WITH THAT PREPPY
BOYFRIEND OF YOURS
IF HE'LL HAVE YOU.

31:43.041 --> 31:45.375
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU REMEMBER
WHEN YOU TOLD ME

31:45.375 --> 31:46.834
TO TELL YOU WHEN YOU
WERE BEING A JERK?

31:46.834 --> 31:49.834
YEAH. YOU COULD HAVE SAVED
YOURSELF A LOT OF TROUBLE
BY JUST CALLING FIRST.

31:49.834 --> 31:53.083
OH. I GUESS
IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE
TROUBLE AT THE TIME.

32:19.667 --> 32:22.750
OH, MY GOD,
THAT WAS AMAZING!

32:22.750 --> 32:24.083
YEAH, WELL,
IT DIDN'T SUCK!

32:24.083 --> 32:26.792
OH, COME ON!
IT WORKED!
THEY LOVED US!

32:26.792 --> 32:27.834
ADMIT IT.
THEY LOVED US.

32:27.834 --> 32:30.917
ALL RIGHT. YEAH.
THEY LOVED US.

32:30.917 --> 32:32.375
JOEY, HONEY,
YOU MADE IT!

32:32.375 --> 32:33.917
YES. I DIDN'T SEE
THE WHOLE THING,

32:33.917 --> 32:34.834
BUT YOU WERE GREAT!

32:34.834 --> 32:36.250
YOU WERE MORE THAN GREAT.
YOU WERE AMAZING.

32:36.250 --> 32:40.458
SEE? DO YOU
SEE THAT?
WE WERE AMAZING.

32:40.458 --> 32:42.875
WHERE'S PACEY?

32:49.083 --> 32:50.250
(SIGHS)

32:50.250 --> 32:55.208
HEATHER, THERE'S SOMEONE
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET.

32:55.208 --> 32:57.625
NATASHA, THIS
IS HEATHER TRACY
FROM THE STUDIO.

32:57.625 --> 32:58.792
HI.
OH, MY GOD!

32:58.792 --> 33:03.208
IT IS SO GREAT--
MWAH!

33:03.208 --> 33:05.000
TO FINALLY
MEET YOU!

33:05.000 --> 33:07.583
YOU HAVE
AMAZING SKIN.

33:07.583 --> 33:09.625
UH...THANKS.

33:09.625 --> 33:10.959
SUCH A TOTAL PRO.

33:10.959 --> 33:13.458
WE ARE SO HAPPY
TO HAVE YOU ON OUR TEAM.

33:13.458 --> 33:16.166
GREAT JOB IN THE SCENE
TONIGHT, BY THE WAY.

33:16.166 --> 33:20.291
THANKS. I DECIDED
NOT TO THINK TONIGHT.

33:20.291 --> 33:22.667
HEATHER, SHALL WE?
GOODY.

33:22.667 --> 33:25.500
I CAN
HARDLY WAIT.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.291
SEE YOU KIDS LATER.

33:32.500 --> 33:34.166
SHE HATES ME, RIGHT?

33:34.166 --> 33:35.291
I WOULDN'T
SAY THAT.

33:35.291 --> 33:36.166
IT'S GENERALLY
NOT A GOOD SIGN

33:36.166 --> 33:38.375
WHEN THE DIRECTOR
LEAVES THE SET AT LUNCH

33:38.375 --> 33:40.375
WITH SOMEONE WHO'S
JUST ARRIVED FROM L.A.

33:40.375 --> 33:42.792
WHAT'D YOU GUYS DO,
GO SHOE SHOPPING?

33:42.792 --> 33:43.750
START AUDITIONING
MY REPLACEMENT?

33:43.750 --> 33:47.875
UH...THE FIRST ONE.

33:47.875 --> 33:49.750
YOU'RE NOT
A GOOD LIAR, DAWSON.

33:49.750 --> 33:54.125
IN FACT, YOU'RE
A SPECTACULARLY BAD LIAR.

33:54.125 --> 33:55.000
COME ON.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.583
YOU CAN
BE HONEST WITH ME.

33:57.583 --> 33:58.792
I KNOW I GOT THIS JOB
ON A FLUKE.

33:58.792 --> 34:01.667
YOU GOT THIS JOB BECAUSE
YOU'RE THE BEST PERSON
FOR THE PART,

34:01.667 --> 34:02.625
BECAUSE YOU'RE
TREMENDOUSLY TALENTED.

34:02.625 --> 34:08.041
YEAH, RIGHT. OR MAYBE
JUST TREMENDOUSLY LUCKY.

34:08.041 --> 34:11.583
I THINK EVERYONE FEELS
THAT WAY ABOUT SUCCESS--

34:11.583 --> 34:13.333
EVERYONE WITH A SOUL.

34:13.333 --> 34:15.625
AND YOU'VE
STILL GOT ONE, RIGHT?

34:15.625 --> 34:18.875
(SIGHS) I THINK SO.

34:18.875 --> 34:26.208
I THINK THAT
MAY BE WHY WE ENDED UP
TOGETHER, YOU AND ME.

34:26.208 --> 34:29.708
WHEN WE MET
AT THAT PARTY...
MM-HMM.

34:29.708 --> 34:32.250
I WAS PRETTY DOWN
ON MYSELF.

34:32.250 --> 34:35.125
I THOUGHT MAYBE
I WAS AN IDIOT FOR
TRYING TO DO THIS THING

34:35.125 --> 34:40.833
AND THAT I SHOULD
JUST GIVE UP
AND, I DON'T KNOW,

34:40.833 --> 34:43.583
BE A KINDERGARTEN
TEACHER LIKE MY MOM'S
ALWAYS TELLING ME.

34:43.583 --> 34:45.208
YOUR MOM WANTED YOU
TO BE A KINDERGARTEN
TEACHER?

34:45.208 --> 34:47.750
(LAUGHS) YEAH.
HA HA!

34:47.750 --> 34:50.542
THERE'S A LOT
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
ABOUT MY TEEN YEARS.

34:50.542 --> 34:52.625
HEH!
ANYWAY...

34:52.625 --> 34:53.583
I REMEMBER THINKING,

34:53.583 --> 34:56.083
IF ONE MORE WORKING ACTOR
SITS DOWN NEXT TO ME

34:56.083 --> 34:58.667
AND STARTS COMPLAINING
ABOUT HIS LIFE,

34:58.667 --> 35:01.417
I WILL SCREAM.
I WILL LITERALLY
GET UP OUT OF THIS CHAIR

35:01.417 --> 35:03.750
AND RUN SCREAMING
TO CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN,

35:03.750 --> 35:05.750
QUIT MY JOB,
AND MOVE HOME.

35:05.750 --> 35:08.083
AND THEN
YOU CAME OVER.

35:08.083 --> 35:11.417
WHY'D YOU DO THAT,
ANYWAY?

35:11.417 --> 35:11.708
HONESTLY?

35:11.708 --> 35:13.417
MM-HMM.

35:13.417 --> 35:15.000
YOU WERE THE ONLY
HOT GIRL IN THE ROOM

35:15.000 --> 35:16.375
WHO LOOKED
LIKE SHE MIGHT HAVE
ACTUALLY READ A BOOK

35:16.375 --> 35:17.750
AT SOME POINT
IN HER LIFE.

35:17.750 --> 35:20.583
AND YOU KNEW RIGHT THEN
THAT I WAS RIGHT
FOR THIS PART.

35:20.583 --> 35:22.500
AFTER I TALKED TO YOU
FOR A LITTLE WHILE,
YEAH.

35:22.500 --> 35:25.417
SO YOU WEREN'T
JUST CHATTING ME UP?

35:25.417 --> 35:26.542
OH, I WAS
CHATTING YOU UP.

35:26.542 --> 35:27.583
YOU WERE?
OH, YEAH.

35:27.583 --> 35:30.250
BUT I FIGURED
TELLING YOU ABOUT
SOME BIG AUDITION

35:30.250 --> 35:31.667
COULDN'T
EXACTLY HURT.

35:31.667 --> 35:33.458
YEAH. THEN I NAILED IT.

35:33.458 --> 35:35.875
I STILL
CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

35:35.875 --> 35:37.667
GOD, THAT WAS A GREAT DAY.

35:37.667 --> 35:41.000
IT FELT LIKE MY LUCK
WAS FINALLY CHANGING.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.583
IT HAS.

35:42.583 --> 35:44.291
YES, IT HAS.

35:47.041 --> 35:50.667
WELL, I SHOULD
GO GET CHANGED.

35:50.667 --> 35:52.125
ALL RIGHT.

35:52.125 --> 35:56.291
BUT MAYBE TONIGHT
AT THE BAR, WE COULD,

35:56.291 --> 35:59.417
I DON'T KNOW,
PLAY SOME AIR HOCKEY

35:59.417 --> 36:00.542
OR THROW SOME DARTS.

36:00.542 --> 36:02.792
I'D LIKE THAT.

36:02.792 --> 36:05.917
ME, TOO.

36:13.667 --> 36:16.166
Audrey: IT KIND OF ROCKS
THAT THE BAR'S
RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET.

36:16.166 --> 36:19.333
IT SIMPLIFIES THINGS
A BIT, ACTUALLY.

36:19.333 --> 36:21.125
YOU KNOW, I REALLY
SHOULD THANK YOU.

36:21.125 --> 36:22.000
WHAT FOR?

36:22.000 --> 36:24.083
FOR TAKING A CHANCE ON ME
AND ALL THAT CRAP.

36:24.083 --> 36:26.708
CAN'T REALLY MESS UP
PUNK-ROCK ALL THAT
BAD, NOW, CAN YOU?

36:26.708 --> 36:28.500
I KNOW, BUT STILL
IT WAS IMPORTANT TO YOU,

36:28.500 --> 36:30.959
AND YOU TRUSTED ME, AND...

36:30.959 --> 36:31.959
LET'S NOT HUG
OR ANYTHING.

36:31.959 --> 36:34.083
YOUR PIG OF
A BOYFRIEND'S
LIKELY TO ENJOY THAT.

36:34.083 --> 36:35.667
HE WOULD, ACTUALLY.

36:35.667 --> 36:38.208
OH, DEAR.

36:38.208 --> 36:40.083
POOR SOT.

36:40.083 --> 36:42.583
HE STAYED UP
ALL LAST NIGHT,
YOU KNOW,

36:42.583 --> 36:43.458
AND HE WAS
GONNA CRASH.

36:43.458 --> 36:47.000
OH, WELL.
SEE YOU TOMORROW.
GOOD NIGHT.

36:47.000 --> 36:47.500
GOOD NIGHT.

36:54.625 --> 36:56.417
UHH!

36:56.417 --> 36:57.750
HEY.

36:58.708 --> 37:00.875
OH, CRAP.

37:00.875 --> 37:03.625
I MISSED IT,
DIDN'T I?

37:03.625 --> 37:04.834
YEAH.

37:04.834 --> 37:07.166
AUDREY, I WAS COMING IN

37:07.166 --> 37:08.708
TO CHANGE MY CLOTHES,
AND I MEANT TO JUST--

37:08.708 --> 37:11.041
YOU DIDN'T GET VERY FAR
WITH THAT, DID YOU?

37:12.792 --> 37:15.250
OK. TELL ME HOW I CAN
MAKE THIS UP TO YOU.

37:15.875 --> 37:17.667
PLEASE.
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

37:17.667 --> 37:24.208
I AM COMPLETELY,
TOTALLY, UTTERLY YOURS,
AT YOUR SERVICE.

37:24.208 --> 37:27.208
I KNOW IT'S KIND OF LATE
AND EVERYTHING,

37:27.208 --> 37:29.041
BUT DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
JUST DRIVE ME HOME?

37:31.708 --> 37:33.500
YEAH, SURE.
OF COURSE.

37:33.500 --> 37:36.291
I JUST KIND OF WANT TO SLEEP
IN MY OWN BED TONIGHT.

37:36.291 --> 37:40.000
ABSOLUTELY.
NOT A PROBLEM.

37:43.875 --> 37:46.458
OK. I'M GONNA
GO GET MY STUFF.

37:46.458 --> 37:50.917
(YAWNS) OK. I'LL BE--
I'LL JUST WAIT HERE.

37:55.750 --> 37:59.542
(SIGHS)

38:04.083 --> 38:06.333
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

38:06.333 --> 38:08.875
I KNEW YOU WERE CLOSING,
THOUGHT YOU COULD USE
A LITTLE HELP.

38:08.875 --> 38:11.417
IN WHAT WAY COULD
YOU POSSIBLY HELP?

38:11.417 --> 38:13.583
ALL RIGHT.
THAT WAS FAIR.

38:13.583 --> 38:14.708
NOT TO MENTION HOW
CONDESCENDING IT IS,

38:14.708 --> 38:17.625
YOU KNOW,
THE ASSUMPTION THAT
I ACTUALLY NEED HELP.

38:17.625 --> 38:20.625
OK, I GET IT.
ARE YOU DONE YET?

38:20.625 --> 38:22.917
ONLY FOR
THE TIME BEING.

38:26.625 --> 38:30.792
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, OK?
THE FIRST TIME I DID IT.

38:30.792 --> 38:33.750
HOW DO YOU ACCIDENTALLY
SIT IN ON A CLASS AND
PRETEND TO BE A STUDENT?

38:33.750 --> 38:36.959
WELL, I'M ON MY LUNCH HOUR,
I'M SITTING UNDER SOME TREE,

38:36.959 --> 38:41.750
AND THIS GRAD STUDENT
COMES OVER WITH HIS WHOLE
SECTION OF "GREAT BOOKS"

38:41.750 --> 38:42.959
ONE-OH-WHATEVER-
THE-HELL-IT-IS,

38:42.959 --> 38:44.583
AND THEY START TALKING
ABOUT SHAKESPEARE.

38:44.583 --> 38:47.000
AND YOU JUST HAPPENED
TO BE READING IT
THAT DAY?

38:47.000 --> 38:48.125
NO. I WAS READING
MOBY DICK.

38:48.125 --> 38:50.125
LATER,
I READ SHAKESPEARE.

38:50.125 --> 38:51.834
ALL OF IT?

38:51.834 --> 38:53.792
NO SENSE IN DOING THINGS
HALFWAY, RIGHT?

38:55.250 --> 38:58.291
I SEE, AND SINCE
IT WAS SO EASY,

38:58.291 --> 39:00.333
YOU JUST
KEPT DOING IT.

39:00.333 --> 39:05.834
IT PREVENTS ME
FROM DELIBERATELY
STEPPING INTO THE STREET

39:05.834 --> 39:08.125
AND METHODICALLY KNOCKING
PEOPLE'S HATS OFF.

39:11.917 --> 39:13.583
MOBY DICK,  RIGHT?

39:13.583 --> 39:17.917
HEY, MAYBE YOU'RE NOT
AS DUMB AS HETSON
THINKS YOU ARE.

39:17.917 --> 39:19.500
WE'LL SEE. LOOK.

39:19.500 --> 39:23.000
CONTRARY TO WHAT
YOU MIGHT BELIEVE,

39:23.000 --> 39:25.667
I ONLY CAME BY YOUR PLACE
TONIGHT TO APOLOGIZE.

39:25.667 --> 39:27.500
I FELT LIKE
IT WAS KIND OF MY FAULT

39:27.500 --> 39:27.917
THAT YOU
GOT CAUGHT TODAY.

39:27.917 --> 39:30.291
HOW'S THAT?

39:30.291 --> 39:31.375
HETSON WOULDN'T
HAVE SINGLED YOU OUT

39:31.375 --> 39:34.208
IF YOU WEREN'T TRYING
TO BE SO NICE TO ME.

39:34.208 --> 39:36.166
NICE? YOU THOUGHT
I WAS TRYING
TO BE NICE TO YOU?

39:36.166 --> 39:39.583
YEAH. IT SEEMED
KIND OF OBVIOUS.

39:39.583 --> 39:41.500
WRONG.

39:41.500 --> 39:42.834
WRONG?

39:42.834 --> 39:44.542
YES. THAT WASN'T ME
BEING NICE.

39:44.542 --> 39:46.250
THAT WAS ME
SHOWING OFF.

39:46.250 --> 39:47.917
YOU KNOW,
YOU DISAPPOINT ME,
POTTER.

39:47.917 --> 39:49.625
I DO?
YES.

39:49.625 --> 39:52.875
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO LEARN ANYTHING
TODAY, PEOPLE?

39:52.875 --> 39:54.834
YOU DIDN'T DO
YOUR GROUNDWORK,
DID YOU?

39:54.834 --> 39:57.667
NO, I DIDN'T.

39:57.667 --> 40:00.000
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

40:06.875 --> 40:08.375
WHAT'S THIS?

40:08.375 --> 40:09.500
YOU LEFT YOUR PAPER
IN MY OFFICE YESTERDAY.

40:09.500 --> 40:12.875
IS THIS SUPPOSED TO
MAKE EVERYTHING OK?

40:12.875 --> 40:16.959
LOOK, MAYBE I DID LET
MY EMOTIONS AFFECT THE WAY
THAT I GRADED YOUR PAPER.

40:16.959 --> 40:17.708
IF I DID,
THAT'S INEXCUSABLE.

40:17.708 --> 40:19.875
I SENSE AN EXCUSE
COMING ON HERE.

40:19.875 --> 40:24.291
YOU HAVE NO IDEA,
DO YOU, OF HOW MUCH
THE WORLD HAS CHANGED?

40:24.291 --> 40:26.000
LOOK, IF THE WORLD'S
CHANGED, IT'S BECAUSE

40:26.000 --> 40:28.166
PEOPLE ARE
WILLING TO STAND UP AND
BE HONEST ABOUT THINGS,

40:28.166 --> 40:30.125
NOT HIDE BEHIND THINGS
THAT ARE EASIER.

40:30.125 --> 40:32.083
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP,
WHEN I WAS--HOW DID YOU
PUT IT--

40:32.083 --> 40:33.834
A SCARED TEENAGER,

40:33.834 --> 40:36.834
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
GAY KIDS COMING OUT
TO THEIR PARENTS ON MTV.

40:36.834 --> 40:40.208
YEAH, AND JACK TRIPPER
WAS THE ONLY GAY MAN
IN AMERICA, RIGHT?

40:40.208 --> 40:41.500
YOU THINK THAT'S
SUCH A SMALL THING,

40:41.500 --> 40:43.875
SUCH A MINUTE
CULTURAL DIFFERENCE?

40:43.875 --> 40:46.750
MAYBE YOU REALLY HAVEN'T
BEEN PAYING ATTENTION
IN MY CLASS, JACK.

40:48.333 --> 40:50.041
JUST DO ME A FAVOR

40:50.041 --> 40:52.959
AND HAVE ONE OF THE
T.A.s GRADE MY PAPERS
FROM NOW ON, PLEASE.

40:55.125 --> 40:56.750
NO PROBLEM.

41:01.625 --> 41:03.458
OOH, NICE.

41:03.458 --> 41:06.834
LITTLE PRIVATE
TEACHER CONFERENCE.

41:06.834 --> 41:08.000
WHAT WAS THAT
ALL ABOUT?

41:08.000 --> 41:11.625
I'M JUST GETTING
THAT THING WITH MY PAPER
STRAIGHTENED OUT.

41:11.625 --> 41:14.250
OH, YEAH. IS IT?

41:14.250 --> 41:15.291
STRAIGHT?

41:16.667 --> 41:19.667
YEAH. PERFECTLY.
