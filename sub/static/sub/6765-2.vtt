WEBVTT

00:03.250 --> 00:04.683
Well, no surprises here.

00:04.718 --> 00:06.845
The next gift is,
of course, from Donna.

00:06.887 --> 00:08.616
Donna's making us all look bad.

00:08.655 --> 00:10.145
She's gotta be stopped.

00:10.190 --> 00:12.658
Think how l feel.
l've been outshopped.

00:12.693 --> 00:14.490
And they said
it couldn't be done.

00:15.862 --> 00:16.886
Can you get everything?

00:16.930 --> 00:18.522
Uh, not quite.

00:18.565 --> 00:19.998
Where's David Silver
when you need him?

00:20.033 --> 00:21.193
l didn't hear
someone say

00:21.234 --> 00:23.259
they needed David Silver.
l didn't, did l?

00:23.337 --> 00:24.998
-No.
-Here, Jesse,

00:25.038 --> 00:26.232
let me do that
for a while.

00:26.273 --> 00:27.240
Oh, thank you.

00:27.274 --> 00:28.241
You're welcome.

00:28.275 --> 00:29.264
All right, you got it?

00:29.343 --> 00:30.571
Yeah, l got it.

00:30.610 --> 00:32.043
-lt's not as easy as it looks.
-Yeah.

00:32.079 --> 00:36.243
Oh, by the way, Brandon,
smart move losing the beard.

00:36.283 --> 00:38.080
Did Kelly tell you
to say that?

00:38.118 --> 00:39.278
No, l did not.

00:39.353 --> 00:42.880
Oh, Donna,
this is beautiful!

00:42.923 --> 00:44.891
Donna, you really cleared
the stores, didn't you?

00:44.925 --> 00:46.290
Yeah, well, your binge-

00:46.326 --> 00:48.260
shopping days are
numbered, sister,

00:48.295 --> 00:50.229
because registration
starts in two days.

00:50.263 --> 00:52.231
You know, l almost managed
to forget about that,

00:52.265 --> 00:54.825
and then l got an urgent call
from Josh Richland this morning.

00:54.868 --> 00:57.496
Josh Richland is a one-man
National Enquirer.

00:57.537 --> 00:59.505
That he is; l'm getting
together with him later

00:59.539 --> 01:01.131
to get all the gory details.

01:01.174 --> 01:04.575
Well, l guess this
is as good a time as any

01:04.611 --> 01:07.774
to tell you guys
something that l, uh,

01:07.814 --> 01:09.805
l've been meaning
to tell you.

01:09.850 --> 01:12.842
Uh, something's come up
and, uh...

01:12.886 --> 01:14.547
Spit it out. Go ahead.

01:14.588 --> 01:15.555
l, uh...

01:15.589 --> 01:18.080
l'm not going back to college.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:28.728 --> 02:30.889
How can there be no more money
left in the account?

02:30.931 --> 02:31.898
What, what about the T-bill?

02:31.932 --> 02:33.160
Well, l'm sorry,

02:33.200 --> 02:35.134
but we rolled it over for you
last week.

02:35.168 --> 02:36.863
You what?

02:36.903 --> 02:39.269
lt was automatically
reinvested.

02:39.306 --> 02:41.399
We tried to notify you.

02:41.441 --> 02:43.272
Well, you didn't.
You didn't notify me.

02:43.376 --> 02:45.139
lt's just like last time
nobody notified me!

02:45.178 --> 02:47.043
You transferred eight million
of my dollars somewhere

02:47.080 --> 02:49.708
30 seconds after
l deposited it!

02:51.485 --> 02:53.783
What about that savings bond?

02:53.820 --> 02:56.618
Well, no, you don't really want
to do that.

02:56.656 --> 02:58.556
l mean. there is
a substantial penalty

02:58.592 --> 02:59.786
for early withdrawal.

02:59.826 --> 03:01.555
l don't care.
How bad can the penalty be?

03:01.595 --> 03:02.994
Look, do l gotta say this?

03:03.029 --> 03:04.587
l need money.

03:05.966 --> 03:08.457
l'm gonna be outside.

03:15.308 --> 03:17.071
Dylan?

03:17.110 --> 03:18.668
Hey, stranger.
Dylan!

03:18.712 --> 03:20.577
Hi, Don.

03:20.614 --> 03:22.343
Hey, so where have
you been hiding out?

03:22.382 --> 03:24.247
You know, we had a baby shower
for Hannah yesterday.

03:24.317 --> 03:25.375
Everyone missed you.

03:25.418 --> 03:27.386
Yeah, l just got back
from Mexico.

03:27.420 --> 03:30.583
Oh, is, uh, is that where you
and Kevin set up your business?

03:30.624 --> 03:31.750
Not exactly.

03:31.791 --> 03:33.418
l was just down there
kicking back.

03:33.460 --> 03:35.394
So, uh, what about you,
what're you doing?

03:35.428 --> 03:37.726
Oh, we have been so busy,
well, my mom and l.

03:37.764 --> 03:39.629
She's right
over there. Mom.

03:39.666 --> 03:41.258
We've been in
Houston all summer.

03:41.334 --> 03:42.562
lt was so incredible.

03:42.602 --> 03:45.264
And guess what?
l am debuting this Christmas.

03:45.305 --> 03:46.897
Debut?

03:46.940 --> 03:48.965
Debutante.

03:49.009 --> 03:50.636
Yeah.

03:50.677 --> 03:52.406
ln fact, there's a benefit
tomorrow night.

03:52.445 --> 03:54.003
lt's the first
of the fall season.

03:54.047 --> 03:55.571
Um, you got a tux?

03:55.615 --> 03:56.843
l've got a wetsuit.

03:56.883 --> 03:58.373
Come on. Everyone's
gonna be there.

03:58.418 --> 03:59.612
lt's for a great cause:

03:59.653 --> 04:01.553
college scholarships
for inner-city kids.

04:01.588 --> 04:03.215
ln fact, Steve's father
is a patron.

04:03.290 --> 04:04.484
He's buying a whole table.

04:04.524 --> 04:07.687
Well, you know, l could go
for one of those.

04:07.727 --> 04:09.319
Really?

04:09.362 --> 04:11.489
Uh, Mom, Mom, guess what?

04:11.531 --> 04:12.520
Hi, Dylan.

04:12.566 --> 04:14.898
Dylan's pledging to buy a table.

04:14.935 --> 04:16.232
Well, that's very
generous of you.

04:16.336 --> 04:18.861
ln fact, maybe
it's too generous.

04:18.904 --> 04:19.963
Are you kidding?

04:20.005 --> 04:22.634
Dylan is practically
a mogul. ln fact,

04:22.676 --> 04:24.769
he owns this very hot
environmental research company.

04:24.811 --> 04:26.073
Really?

04:26.112 --> 04:29.081
Yeah. l, uh, l love a good
cause, what can l say?

04:29.115 --> 04:31.845
Excuse me.
Mr. McKay?

04:31.885 --> 04:34.115
l'll be right back.

04:34.154 --> 04:35.121
Okay.

04:35.155 --> 04:37.248
We'll wait.

04:37.324 --> 04:40.020
lt's the least we
can do for $2,500.

04:40.060 --> 04:41.584
Well, that's pretty good.

05:30.243 --> 05:32.211
Hey!

05:32.245 --> 05:33.644
Have you found
any good courses yet?

05:33.680 --> 05:35.648
Oh, a couple that
look interesting.

05:35.682 --> 05:36.910
We'll see.

05:36.950 --> 05:39.009
How's Brandon
holding out in there?

05:39.052 --> 05:41.520
That Josh guy is
quite a salesman.

05:41.554 --> 05:44.250
He never stops talking.

05:44.324 --> 05:46.690
Those two were barely on
speaking terms last year.

05:46.726 --> 05:49.354
Well, times change.

05:49.396 --> 05:50.624
People change.

05:50.664 --> 05:52.256
Which reminds me,

05:52.332 --> 05:54.266
l have nothing to wear tomorrow.

05:54.334 --> 05:56.632
l mean, my clothes
were okay for Buffalo,

05:56.670 --> 05:59.400
but Steve's father is taking us
to the banquet in his Bentley.

05:59.439 --> 06:01.168
Well, did you look through
Brenda's closet?

06:01.207 --> 06:02.731
Size two?

06:02.776 --> 06:03.834
l wish.

06:03.877 --> 06:06.937
Well, then, there's only
one thing to do.

06:09.616 --> 06:11.743
Oh, Cindy, l-l couldn't.

06:11.785 --> 06:12.809
Please.

06:12.852 --> 06:14.649
l insist.

06:14.688 --> 06:15.814
Cindy, my mother

06:15.855 --> 06:17.914
made me promise
not to be a burden on you.

06:17.957 --> 06:20.687
You are not a burden.

06:20.727 --> 06:23.059
Besides, this will be
between you and me.

06:23.096 --> 06:24.222
My treat.

06:24.297 --> 06:26.527
Thanks. You're amazing.

06:29.135 --> 06:31.763
We don't need an affiliation,
we'll run as independents.

06:31.805 --> 06:33.932
l'll be president,
you'll be vice president...

06:33.973 --> 06:35.440
unless you have
a problem with me.

06:35.475 --> 06:36.840
Look, it's not that.

06:36.876 --> 06:38.036
Actually, l'm flattered

06:38.078 --> 06:39.636
that you want me to be
your running mate.

06:39.679 --> 06:41.772
Okay, then take
the plunge, Walsh.

06:41.815 --> 06:42.941
l'm sorry, man.

06:42.982 --> 06:45.007
l just don't have
the stomach for it.

06:45.051 --> 06:46.245
Valerie, could you convince

06:46.319 --> 06:47.843
Brandon to run
for office with me?

06:47.887 --> 06:49.912
Probably could.

06:53.760 --> 06:55.250
l can't believe

06:55.328 --> 06:57.228
you get to share
a bathroom with that girl.

06:57.263 --> 06:58.457
Just don't make it the subject

06:58.498 --> 07:00.591
of your next sleazy exposé,
all right?

07:00.633 --> 07:03.625
Wait, l set out to write
a nice, little puff piece

07:03.670 --> 07:05.103
on how Kim and Landon

07:05.138 --> 07:07.106
fell in love on the
campaign trail.

07:07.140 --> 07:08.573
How was l supposed
to know they were dipping

07:08.608 --> 07:10.940
into the student fund
to decorate their apartment?

07:10.977 --> 07:13.411
Still, gunning for their jobs
after forcing them

07:13.446 --> 07:15.880
to resign does seem a little
self-serving, doesn't it?

07:15.915 --> 07:17.610
Come on.

07:17.650 --> 07:19.208
l know you want
to be in the game.

07:19.252 --> 07:21.083
Forget it.

07:21.121 --> 07:23.851
Do you remember how brutal
the campaign got last spring?

07:23.890 --> 07:25.949
lt was out of control,
especially after the Greeks

07:25.992 --> 07:28.017
published every
candidate's SAT scores.

07:28.061 --> 07:29.085
Actually, l thought that

07:29.129 --> 07:30.994
-was a stroke of genius.
-You see, Josh,

07:31.030 --> 07:33.430
that's why you're cut out
for student politics,

07:33.466 --> 07:34.899
-and l'm not.
-Brandon,

07:34.934 --> 07:37.232
-it's Kelly on the phone.
-As in Kelly,

07:37.270 --> 07:38.601
your make-believe girlfriend?

07:40.306 --> 07:42.206
Unlike you, Josh,
l have better things

07:42.242 --> 07:44.142
to do with my time
than be a punching bag

07:44.177 --> 07:46.168
in an election we'd lose anyway.

07:46.212 --> 07:49.238
So, what l'm hearing is
you wouldn't mind winning.

07:50.283 --> 07:51.545
Hey, babe.

07:51.584 --> 07:53.074
Brandon, thank God.

07:53.119 --> 07:54.381
l need a reality check.

07:54.420 --> 07:55.444
l'm at the Martins'

07:55.488 --> 07:56.785
with people l don't even know.

07:56.823 --> 08:00.452
They have names
like Buffy Moneymaker.

08:00.493 --> 08:02.586
Donna's gone completely
over the edge.

08:02.629 --> 08:04.096
She's having some guy
named Travis

08:04.130 --> 08:05.563
fly up from Houston
to escort her

08:05.598 --> 08:07.031
to the benefit tomorrow night.

08:07.066 --> 08:09.159
But that's not why l called.

08:09.202 --> 08:10.191
Guess who's back in town.

08:10.303 --> 08:11.531
You talked to Dylan?

08:11.571 --> 08:13.129
No, but Donna did.

08:13.173 --> 08:14.367
Well, what'd he say?

08:14.407 --> 08:17.399
Uh, l'll call you back.

08:17.443 --> 08:18.967
How are we doing, dear?

08:19.012 --> 08:20.604
Good.

08:20.647 --> 08:22.080
We're starting to get
some more pledges.

08:22.115 --> 08:23.878
lt's very sweet of you to help.

08:23.917 --> 08:25.544
Anything for Donna.

08:26.553 --> 08:27.986
Listen, Kelly, l just

08:28.021 --> 08:29.818
want to assure you
that whatever happens

08:29.856 --> 08:31.983
with Donna, Dr. Martin
and l will cover her rent

08:32.025 --> 08:34.424
until you find
a new roommate.

08:34.460 --> 08:35.950
A new roommate?

08:35.995 --> 08:37.621
Where is Donna going?

08:37.664 --> 08:39.928
Well, nowhere yet, but...

08:39.966 --> 08:42.433
at least not for
the next month.

08:42.467 --> 08:45.232
Didn't she tell you
what's going on with her?

08:45.305 --> 08:47.705
No. l guess she didn't
get around to it.

08:56.316 --> 08:58.546
So you're ditching
the apartment?

08:58.585 --> 09:01.315
l'm not ''ditching.''

09:01.354 --> 09:03.322
Didn't my mom talk to you?

09:03.356 --> 09:04.846
How come you didn't
talk to me?

09:06.426 --> 09:07.586
You know how l am.

09:08.628 --> 09:10.528
l'm beginning to wonder if l do.

09:10.563 --> 09:12.724
l mean, it's enough
of a bombshell

09:12.765 --> 09:16.132
to hear that you're
dropping out of school.

09:16.169 --> 09:19.036
lt's just for one semester,
so l can debut.

09:19.072 --> 09:21.666
lt's only because my cotillion
might be in Houston.

09:21.708 --> 09:23.005
You're moving to Houston?

09:23.042 --> 09:24.066
Maybe.

09:24.110 --> 09:25.941
lt's just another zip code.

09:25.979 --> 09:27.947
You know we'll always
stay in touch.

09:27.981 --> 09:29.448
Donna,

09:29.482 --> 09:31.848
you're absolutely right,
the canapés are perfect.

09:31.885 --> 09:33.079
l told you.

09:33.119 --> 09:34.848
Listen, Madeline Carins
and her daughter are here,

09:34.888 --> 09:37.356
so l think you really ought to
come out and join the group.

09:37.390 --> 09:38.687
Yeah, we were
just about to.

09:38.725 --> 09:40.693
Good. Let's go.

09:40.727 --> 09:42.388
Come on.

09:48.301 --> 09:51.134
lt-it wa... it was... weird.

09:51.170 --> 09:54.196
lt was like Donna
joined a cult or something.

09:54.240 --> 09:56.572
Every time l tried
to talk to her in private,

09:56.609 --> 09:59.100
her mom would suddenly appear
out of nowhere.

09:59.145 --> 10:01.943
Sort of spooky.

10:01.981 --> 10:04.006
Didn't they feed
you at this thing?

10:04.050 --> 10:05.847
l was afraid
to eat the food.

10:05.885 --> 10:07.409
l thought l might
turn into one of them.

10:07.453 --> 10:09.421
-Mm.
-You think l'm kidding.

10:09.455 --> 10:10.615
Well, from what
you described,

10:10.657 --> 10:13.524
it sounds
very... refined.

10:13.559 --> 10:16.187
Donna's dropping
out of school.

10:16.229 --> 10:17.457
For a few months

10:17.497 --> 10:19.260
to go to a bunch of
parties with rich people.

10:19.365 --> 10:21.356
What's the big deal?

10:23.236 --> 10:24.669
l know what this is about.

10:24.704 --> 10:26.137
This is about David.

10:26.172 --> 10:28.003
She wants to move out of L.A.

10:28.041 --> 10:29.565
so she doesn't have
to deal with seeing him.

10:30.610 --> 10:31.975
Kel,

10:32.011 --> 10:36.380
um... don't take this the
wrong way, but ever since

10:36.416 --> 10:38.475
the Dylan sighting,
you've been a little

10:38.518 --> 10:40.577
high-strung.

10:41.654 --> 10:42.814
l know.

10:42.855 --> 10:44.846
l'm sorry.

10:46.859 --> 10:50.260
When are we going
to tell him about us?

10:50.296 --> 10:51.957
l don't know.

10:51.998 --> 10:54.432
We'll figure something out.

10:54.467 --> 10:57.061
lt's like we're back
in a triangle all over again.

10:57.103 --> 11:00.163
Except l'm not Brenda, and
we're not in high school.

11:00.206 --> 11:02.697
Yeah, but it... when
it's two against one,

11:02.742 --> 11:05.233
you're always
ganging up on someone.

11:05.278 --> 11:07.576
All right, then,
l tell Dylan by myself,

11:07.613 --> 11:08.773
if that's what you want.

11:08.815 --> 11:10.248
You'd do that?

11:10.316 --> 11:11.977
Amongst other things.

11:12.018 --> 11:14.111
Like what?

11:20.159 --> 11:21.820
Like that?

11:24.664 --> 11:25.653
Like that?

11:42.949 --> 11:44.917
Well, howdy there, cutie!

11:44.951 --> 11:46.282
-Hi, Nat.
-Mm.

11:46.352 --> 11:47.910
Nat, this is
Travis Farnham.

11:47.954 --> 11:49.182
Howdy.

11:49.222 --> 11:50.951
Hi. Travis, you must be, uh,

11:50.990 --> 11:52.514
the guy from the big state

11:52.558 --> 11:54.617
that Donna keeps
telling us about.

11:54.660 --> 11:56.287
Well, l sincerely
hope it's me.

11:56.329 --> 11:57.660
But then, little Donna here--

11:57.697 --> 12:00.222
she has half of Houston wrapped
around her little finger.

12:01.367 --> 12:02.527
$6.75.

12:02.568 --> 12:03.728
Excuse me.

12:05.071 --> 12:06.868
Ooh.

12:08.641 --> 12:09.972
Excuse me.

12:11.411 --> 12:13.675
l think this belongs to you.

12:13.713 --> 12:16.238
Thanks.

12:16.349 --> 12:18.977
How you doing, Donna?

12:19.018 --> 12:20.883
Good. Hi, David.

12:20.920 --> 12:23.252
Uh, David Silver.
This is my friend,

12:23.322 --> 12:24.812
Travis Farnham.

12:24.857 --> 12:26.085
Nice to meet you.

12:26.125 --> 12:28.252
-So, you're from Houston, huh?
-Yeah.

12:28.361 --> 12:30.124
Yeah, l just flew
in to escort Donna

12:30.163 --> 12:31.687
to this little charity
shindig they're having.

12:31.731 --> 12:33.961
Hey, would you like to
sit down and join us?

12:36.335 --> 12:39.634
No. l've, uh... l
gotta get going.

12:40.907 --> 12:43.102
Nice to see you.

12:43.142 --> 12:45.576
You, too, David.

12:45.611 --> 12:48.671
Did l, uh... Did l say
something wrong, Donna?

12:48.714 --> 12:49.681
No.

12:49.715 --> 12:51.478
Actually, just the opposite.

12:51.517 --> 12:53.314
Thank you.

12:57.924 --> 12:59.289
Hola.

12:59.392 --> 13:01.986
Hey, Mr. Walsh,
good to see you.

13:02.028 --> 13:04.326
Really? 'Cause the
incommunicado treatment

13:04.363 --> 13:05.796
kind of had me wondering.

13:05.832 --> 13:07.823
Yeah. Sorry. l should
have checked the messages,

13:07.867 --> 13:09.164
-you know.
-No problem.

13:09.202 --> 13:11.193
Come on in.

13:12.205 --> 13:13.331
l was getting ready

13:13.372 --> 13:15.567
to take the bike out
for a test ride.

13:15.608 --> 13:18.236
You mean, this thing
actually runs?

13:18.311 --> 13:21.144
l always thought of it
as a porch decoration.

13:21.180 --> 13:22.772
Oh, no way, man.
Me and Kelly used

13:22.815 --> 13:24.407
to take it out every
weekend, seemed like.

13:24.450 --> 13:25.974
We'd drive up to Morro Bay.

13:26.018 --> 13:28.009
She loved to go camping.

13:30.223 --> 13:32.157
You want a beer?

13:32.191 --> 13:33.522
No, thanks.

13:33.559 --> 13:35.356
You want to quit staring
at mine, then?

13:35.394 --> 13:38.261
Tell me you're fine,
l won't say a thing about it.

13:38.364 --> 13:39.922
l'm fine.

13:40.967 --> 13:42.958
Although l have been...

13:43.002 --> 13:44.833
missing Kelly
a little bit lately.

13:44.871 --> 13:47.032
But you guys were always
fighting when you were together.

13:47.073 --> 13:48.506
Ah, it was always complicated.

13:48.541 --> 13:49.769
Brenda was around.

13:49.809 --> 13:51.970
Brenda called from
London the other day.

13:52.011 --> 13:53.603
After hitting up Dad
for more money,

13:53.646 --> 13:55.511
the first thing
she asked about was you.

13:55.548 --> 13:58.517
She seems like
such a long time ago.

13:58.551 --> 14:00.212
Everybody does, man.

14:00.253 --> 14:04.053
lt's just... like people
l knew in high school.

14:05.558 --> 14:08.049
Except you... Kel.

14:08.094 --> 14:09.391
You know what l mean?

14:10.429 --> 14:13.227
You sure you don't want a beer?

14:25.011 --> 14:27.104
l guess you guys have thought
of everything, huh?

14:27.146 --> 14:29.011
Well, not everything,
but we're working on it.

14:29.048 --> 14:30.242
You're still
affiliated

14:30.349 --> 14:32.146
with the Graduate School
of Education, aren't you?

14:32.185 --> 14:33.152
Absolutely.

14:33.186 --> 14:34.517
See, that's why

14:34.554 --> 14:36.146
they have such a phenomenal
child-to-caregiver ratio.

14:36.189 --> 14:37.850
What are your hours again?

14:37.890 --> 14:41.053
Oh, it's, uh, 7:30 to 6:00
Monday through Friday,

14:41.093 --> 14:43.186
and 9:00 to 4:00
on Saturdays.

14:43.229 --> 14:45.697
l read the brochure.

14:45.731 --> 14:47.858
Oh, your mother's
very thorough, Hannah.

14:47.900 --> 14:49.197
You'd better get used to it.

14:49.235 --> 14:50.725
She's already
used to it,

14:50.770 --> 14:53.261
and you're going to love it
here, aren't you, boo-boo?

14:53.372 --> 14:54.600
Yeah.

14:54.640 --> 14:57.404
Well, l, uh, think
it's unanimous.

14:57.443 --> 15:00.276
Great. So unless
you have any other questions,

15:00.346 --> 15:02.075
l'll see you
at registration.

15:02.114 --> 15:03.308
Thank you, Stacy.

15:03.349 --> 15:04.543
My pleasure.

15:04.584 --> 15:05.551
Thanks.

15:05.585 --> 15:06.574
You're welcome.

15:07.954 --> 15:10.388
We are so lucky we got a
priority number for this place.

15:10.423 --> 15:12.220
You think so?

15:12.325 --> 15:13.883
Jesse.

15:13.926 --> 15:16.360
l'm sorry. lt's just

15:16.395 --> 15:18.693
the whole concept of daycare--
it's so institutional to me.

15:18.731 --> 15:21.029
No, the hospital
was institutional.

15:21.067 --> 15:23.035
This place is
the total opposite.

15:23.069 --> 15:24.536
l mean, it's, it's warm,

15:24.570 --> 15:26.868
it's personal
and it's nurturing.

15:26.906 --> 15:29.033
Then why is that baby
crying over there?

15:31.711 --> 15:34.111
Because babies cry.

15:34.146 --> 15:36.205
Look, maybe it has
to have its diapers changed,

15:36.249 --> 15:38.877
maybe it's hungry,
maybe it just needs to be held.

15:38.918 --> 15:40.249
And you're perfectly okay

15:40.319 --> 15:42.253
with some strange person
doing all the holding?

15:42.321 --> 15:43.811
No, in a perfect universe,

15:43.856 --> 15:46.552
of course,
l would rather her be home.

15:46.592 --> 15:49.652
But Jesse, your mom works,
my mom works.

15:49.695 --> 15:52.027
Grandma Rose
isn't up to it.

15:52.064 --> 15:55.033
l mean, why should we pay
for a full-time baby-sitter,

15:55.067 --> 15:58.036
when... when the school
will do it free of charge?

15:58.070 --> 16:01.198
Besides, in between classes,

16:01.240 --> 16:04.403
l can come down
and be with her.

16:04.443 --> 16:06.434
Yeah, l guess
it's just a matter

16:06.479 --> 16:08.208
of getting used
to a new routine.

16:08.314 --> 16:12.683
Well, l think we're pretty good
at getting used to new routines.

16:19.925 --> 16:22.393
Believe me,
it was not the right time

16:22.428 --> 16:24.055
to tell Dylan about us.

16:24.096 --> 16:26.496
There is never going
to be a right time,

16:26.532 --> 16:27.726
and you know it.

16:27.767 --> 16:29.564
Fine, then.
Why don't we bite the bullet,

16:29.602 --> 16:32.571
and we'll both go over to his
house and tell him right now?

16:32.605 --> 16:35.073
l can't. Mrs. Martin is hosting

16:35.107 --> 16:37.234
a pre-benefit reception
for all the bigwigs.

16:37.276 --> 16:39.244
lf l don't get going,
l'm going to be late.

16:39.278 --> 16:40.575
Well, thanks for inviting me.

16:40.613 --> 16:43.946
You should be thanking me
for sparing you.

16:43.983 --> 16:46.076
Well, if all these people
are such stiffs,

16:46.118 --> 16:48.484
why don't you sit
at Steve's father's table

16:48.521 --> 16:50.113
with the rest
of us riffraff?

16:50.156 --> 16:51.589
Brandon, l told you--

16:51.624 --> 16:53.717
they're thinking of shipping
Donna back to Houston,

16:53.759 --> 16:55.920
and somebody's got
to do something.

16:58.931 --> 17:00.956
Can l call you back?

17:01.000 --> 17:02.194
l'll see you there.

17:02.268 --> 17:04.065
Okay. l love you.

17:04.103 --> 17:06.094
Yeah, l love you, too.

17:07.106 --> 17:08.630
Brandon, l spilled
some makeup.

17:08.674 --> 17:10.733
Can you tell if
l got it out?

17:10.776 --> 17:13.506
lt's kind of hard
to focus on the dress

17:13.546 --> 17:15.207
given the other scenery.

17:15.281 --> 17:16.771
Oh.

17:16.816 --> 17:19.751
Sorry. l... thought
we were like family now.

17:19.785 --> 17:21.218
Well, we are, but...

17:21.287 --> 17:23.084
Brandon,
it's okay.

17:23.122 --> 17:24.214
l get it.

17:24.290 --> 17:25.814
Um, just tell me one thing.

17:25.858 --> 17:27.119
Do you like the dress?

17:27.159 --> 17:28.820
Can't wait to see it on you.

17:28.861 --> 17:30.852
Good.

17:38.304 --> 17:39.931
Excuse me. Excuse me.

17:39.972 --> 17:42.202
Excuse me!

17:48.013 --> 17:50.413
Cobi! Great smile.

17:50.449 --> 17:52.076
-Yeah, there we go!
-Oh, beautiful!

17:52.118 --> 17:53.710
That looks great.

17:53.753 --> 17:55.812
Can you move in
a little on the right?

17:55.855 --> 17:56.981
Okay, thanks. Over here.

17:57.022 --> 17:57.989
Cobi?

17:58.023 --> 17:59.251
Look this way. Perfect.

17:59.358 --> 18:00.484
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

18:00.526 --> 18:01.891
Where's Steve?

18:01.927 --> 18:03.986
Arguing with his father
about whether Pebble Beach

18:04.029 --> 18:05.826
is a better golf
course than Kapalua.

18:05.865 --> 18:06.991
Pebble Beach?

18:07.032 --> 18:08.294
Are they always
like that?

18:08.334 --> 18:09.460
When they're talking.

18:09.502 --> 18:10.696
Come on, let's go in.

18:10.736 --> 18:12.931
See, these guys from
the U.S. soccer team.

18:12.972 --> 18:14.132
Oh...

18:19.545 --> 18:21.342
Then Travis's parents
made everyone go outside,

18:21.380 --> 18:23.940
and right there, in the backyard
was the entire philharmonic!

18:25.151 --> 18:26.209
Only in Texas.

18:26.318 --> 18:27.683
Better face facts, Donna.

18:27.720 --> 18:30.086
You just may have to debut
in Houston.

18:30.122 --> 18:31.919
Yeah, that's what l
told her, Mrs. Martin.

18:31.957 --> 18:34.187
l said l wouldn't be satisfied
until l've seen her do

18:34.226 --> 18:35.716
the Texas Dip.

18:35.761 --> 18:37.422
Uh, excuse me.

18:37.463 --> 18:38.657
l grew up in Texas,

18:38.697 --> 18:40.665
and l've never heard
of a Texas Dip.

18:40.699 --> 18:41.825
Oh. D'Shawn!

18:41.867 --> 18:43.425
-Hope l'm not intruding.
-No!

18:43.469 --> 18:46.336
Stay... please.

18:46.372 --> 18:47.896
Mom, Dad, this is
D'Shawn Hardell.

18:47.940 --> 18:49.237
Everyone knows
who D'Shawn is.

18:49.341 --> 18:50.638
How's the leg, son?

18:50.676 --> 18:52.644
-100% .
-D'Shawn,

18:52.678 --> 18:53.872
this is Travis Farnham.

18:53.913 --> 18:55.608
-Howdy.
-Hey.

18:55.648 --> 18:57.172
-Nice to meet you.
-D'Shawn plays

18:57.216 --> 18:59.081
on the basketball team at C.U.

18:59.118 --> 19:02.178
Correction. D'Shawn is
the basketball team at C.U.

19:02.288 --> 19:03.721
What are you
doing here, man?

19:03.756 --> 19:04.882
-l'm a presenter.
-Aha.

19:04.924 --> 19:06.824
But right now l'm
trying to get Donna

19:06.859 --> 19:08.793
to tell me what
a Texas Dip is.

19:08.828 --> 19:10.489
Uh...

19:10.529 --> 19:13.692
lt's, uh... it's the bow
that a debutante does to society

19:13.732 --> 19:15.427
at the Presentation Ball.

19:15.468 --> 19:17.629
Well, it's not just a bow.
No, ma'am.

19:17.670 --> 19:19.535
lt's a precision
maneuver

19:19.572 --> 19:21.836
of strength and timing

19:21.874 --> 19:23.466
and feminine grace.

19:24.743 --> 19:26.040
Oh. This l got to see.

19:26.078 --> 19:27.841
Why don't you show them?

19:29.315 --> 19:31.215
lt's really...
lt's not perfect yet.

19:31.317 --> 19:33.012
Oh, come on now, Donna.

19:33.052 --> 19:34.849
Now, the audience
demands a dip.

19:37.690 --> 19:40.887
Now, you have to imagine
she's just come down

19:40.926 --> 19:44.692
a long marble staircase
with two escorts.

19:44.730 --> 19:47.358
And all of Houston society
stands before her

19:47.399 --> 19:49.765
perfectly still.

20:12.358 --> 20:14.349
See what l mean?

20:14.393 --> 20:16.452
They've turned her
into a trained seal.

20:16.495 --> 20:18.895
Maybe you should
talk to her.

20:25.671 --> 20:26.865
Good night.

20:26.906 --> 20:28.931
'Night, honey.

20:28.974 --> 20:31.374
Valerie's dress
cost how much?!

20:31.410 --> 20:33.173
$300 is cheap.

20:33.212 --> 20:35.976
And she looked all over
to find something on sale.

20:36.015 --> 20:38.677
Yeah, all over Rodeo Drive.

20:38.717 --> 20:40.708
Brenda and l ran
into the same problem

20:40.753 --> 20:41.981
when we first moved here.

20:46.258 --> 20:48.158
Look what the cat dragged in.

20:50.529 --> 20:52.520
How you doing, partner?

20:52.565 --> 20:54.556
Um, sit down. Sit.

20:58.103 --> 20:59.798
l don't think
l'm gonna stay that long.

20:59.838 --> 21:01.567
Come on, l'll get
you some coffee. Sit.

21:01.607 --> 21:03.575
Just looking. l'm not
gonna say anything.

21:03.609 --> 21:05.770
l know what's going on inside.
Just... Just try to be nice.

21:05.811 --> 21:06.903
Dylan!

21:06.946 --> 21:08.743
-You just got to let go.
-Hey, you two.

21:08.781 --> 21:11.443
Got something to say about me,
why don't you say it to me?

21:11.483 --> 21:13.610
We weren't talking
about you, Dylan,

21:13.652 --> 21:15.244
but if it
looked that way,

21:15.321 --> 21:16.720
we apologize.

21:16.755 --> 21:19.155
Look, we don't owe this guy
any apologies.

21:19.191 --> 21:21.159
You're sitting in my booth,
my restaurant.

21:21.193 --> 21:23.991
You're not welcome
here anymore.

21:24.029 --> 21:26.020
Enjoy your meal.

21:33.138 --> 21:34.435
Dylan!

21:34.473 --> 21:36.941
Dylan, what the hell
are you doing?

21:36.976 --> 21:38.603
Come on. Nat,
the guy's a jerk.

21:38.644 --> 21:40.441
He's been in my face
since the day l met him.

21:40.479 --> 21:42.606
Oh, yeah? Well, that guy's been
through thick and thin with me,

21:42.648 --> 21:44.616
and he can go in the joint
and eat anytime he wants.

21:44.650 --> 21:45.947
Hey, l'll go you
one better.

21:45.985 --> 21:47.452
Why don't you make
him your partner?

21:47.486 --> 21:49.113
l'll sell him my half
anytime you want!

21:49.154 --> 21:51.520
What's happening to you?!

21:51.557 --> 21:54.287
You know, l never
thought l'd say this.

21:54.393 --> 21:56.520
l think all that money
you got in the bank

21:56.562 --> 21:58.029
has finally gone to your head.

21:58.063 --> 21:59.655
Nat, l love ya.
You don't know

21:59.698 --> 22:00.824
what you're talking
about here.

22:00.866 --> 22:02.390
Well, then what is it, man?

22:02.434 --> 22:03.594
Don't shut me out!

22:03.636 --> 22:05.194
Come on, give me some trust.

22:05.237 --> 22:07.228
Look, l'm having
a rough spot right now.

22:07.339 --> 22:08.567
ls it Kelly?

22:08.607 --> 22:10.040
l don't know. Maybe.

22:10.075 --> 22:11.474
-l don't know. Maybe.
-Aah!

22:11.510 --> 22:12.875
What do you expect?

22:12.911 --> 22:15.641
You take off, you don't
write, you don't call.

22:15.681 --> 22:17.774
You can't blame her
for going to Brandon.

22:21.920 --> 22:23.911
What did you say?

22:33.232 --> 22:35.928
You know, she hardly said a
word to me all through dinner.

22:35.968 --> 22:37.560
Then she gets up
with a total stranger

22:37.603 --> 22:38.900
and hits the dance floor.

22:38.937 --> 22:40.734
Well, Steve, maybe
if you hadn't spent all night

22:40.773 --> 22:43.765
bickering with your dad
about who has the best golf...

22:43.809 --> 22:45.834
Aw, come on, man, look,
look, l like this girl,

22:45.878 --> 22:46.845
Okay.

22:46.879 --> 22:48.073
Just put a good
word in for me.

22:48.113 --> 22:49.137
Okay.

22:49.181 --> 22:52.014
A good word... that means one.

22:52.051 --> 22:53.575
Either of you gents
seen Donna?

22:53.619 --> 22:55.052
lsn't she with her mom?

22:55.087 --> 22:56.520
No.

22:56.555 --> 22:58.455
l'm sure
she'll materialize soon, though.

22:58.490 --> 23:00.287
The band's fixing to play
a little Texas classic

23:00.359 --> 23:03.692
we danced to all summer--
''Faded Love.''

23:03.729 --> 23:05.822
Gets her every time.

23:06.865 --> 23:08.833
Breathe, breathe.

23:11.203 --> 23:14.536
So you and Brandon seem
to be getting along.

23:14.573 --> 23:16.837
So do you and
your mother.

23:19.344 --> 23:21.005
Look, don't think
l haven't noticed

23:21.046 --> 23:24.413
that you don't exactly approve
of what l'm doing.

23:25.718 --> 23:27.913
What are
you doing?

23:27.953 --> 23:30.922
Dropping out of school and
moving 2,000 miles away

23:30.956 --> 23:33.720
so you can learn
how to curtsy?

23:33.759 --> 23:37.126
Kel, l'm taking off
one semester.

23:37.162 --> 23:38.629
Donna, come on.

23:38.664 --> 23:41.098
l know how hard the end
of last year was for you.

23:41.133 --> 23:44.830
l mean... believe me,
l know how you feel.

23:44.870 --> 23:47.930
l mean, l feel kind of weird
about seeing Dylan again.

23:47.973 --> 23:49.167
Yeah, well,
for your information,

23:49.208 --> 23:50.800
l saw David today,
and it was easy.

23:50.843 --> 23:53.175
And my going to Houston has
nothing to do with David,

23:53.212 --> 23:54.770
and l resent you
even bringing that up!

23:54.813 --> 23:55.939
Why are you
yelling at me?

23:55.981 --> 23:57.278
You know what? You knew

23:57.316 --> 23:58.806
how important tonight was to me.

23:58.851 --> 24:00.284
Thanks for trying
to bring me down.

24:00.319 --> 24:02.617
lmportant to you
or to your mother?

24:26.278 --> 24:30.237
l've been practicing
that Texas dip of yours,

24:30.315 --> 24:31.942
and you ought to go
out for gymnastics.

24:31.984 --> 24:34.748
Oh, th-there it is.

24:34.787 --> 24:36.414
That cheered you up
a little bit, huh?

24:36.455 --> 24:40.221
Sorry, l know you're supposed
to sparkle at these things.

24:40.259 --> 24:41.385
Mm.

24:41.426 --> 24:43.121
At least
that's what my mom says.

24:43.162 --> 24:45.460
Well, my mother says
if you're always up,

24:45.497 --> 24:46.589
you must be on something.

24:48.300 --> 24:51.269
l hope this isn't about that
boyfriend of yours again.

24:51.303 --> 24:52.270
ls it?

24:52.304 --> 24:54.499
l don't know.

24:54.540 --> 24:57.100
lt's not
like l miss him exactly.

24:57.142 --> 25:02.079
lt's... it's just that it's
really hard to think about him

25:02.114 --> 25:03.945
without feeling
like a failure.

25:03.982 --> 25:06.610
That's going to get you nowhere.

25:06.652 --> 25:09.212
You got a big fan club, girl,

25:09.254 --> 25:11.347
and l'm proud to be
a charter member.

25:12.391 --> 25:15.189
Look, you know
you're special,

25:15.227 --> 25:17.218
even when you don't sparkle.

25:17.329 --> 25:19.854
Thank you.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.228
Want to dance?

25:23.335 --> 25:25.530
Yes, l love this song.

25:25.571 --> 25:27.402
Oh, shall we?

25:27.439 --> 25:28.428
We shall.

25:28.473 --> 25:31.340
-Oh...
-Mm-hmm.

25:31.376 --> 25:34.106
Universal health coverage
has its place,

25:34.146 --> 25:38.242
but not if it's going to cost
more taxes for you know who.

25:46.692 --> 25:48.557
Maybe Donna's right.

25:48.594 --> 25:50.459
Maybe l'm just trying
to ruin her life.

25:50.495 --> 25:51.621
Well, l wouldn't
put it past you.

25:51.663 --> 25:52.994
You've certainly
ruined mine.

25:55.701 --> 25:57.999
Well, look at that.

25:58.036 --> 26:00.004
Steve might get
lucky after all.

26:00.038 --> 26:01.027
What about you?

26:01.073 --> 26:03.166
You want to get lucky?

26:08.013 --> 26:09.981
Hmm, what would
Ms. Martin say

26:10.015 --> 26:12.415
about this public
display of affection?

26:12.451 --> 26:13.440
''Shocking.

26:13.485 --> 26:14.713
Where can l get some?''

26:20.792 --> 26:24.193
You two are like a bad movie--
my best friend, my best girl.

26:24.229 --> 26:26.129
What's this,
Blondie and The Boy Scout?

26:26.164 --> 26:27.893
l tried to tell you
at your house today.

26:27.933 --> 26:28.900
Really?
'Cause you said

26:28.934 --> 26:30.959
you came to welcome me home,
Brandon.

26:32.271 --> 26:34.102
l assume this isn't just
a physical thing, right?

26:34.139 --> 26:37.040
'Cause Kelly, she's not
into that, not anymore.

26:37.075 --> 26:38.235
lsn't that right, Kel?

26:38.277 --> 26:40.108
Don't try to make me
feel guilty, Dylan.

26:40.145 --> 26:41.339
Do you feel guilty?

26:42.381 --> 26:45.179
Huh?

26:45.217 --> 26:48.084
Do you... Brandon?

26:48.120 --> 26:50.918
l'm sorry you had
to find out this way.

26:50.956 --> 26:53.424
Don't you ever be sorry for me.

26:53.458 --> 26:55.085
All right, then, l'm not sorry.

26:55.127 --> 26:56.458
Why don't you shut up, then?

26:56.495 --> 26:57.962
Why don't you shut up?

26:57.996 --> 26:59.020
-Why don't you make me?
-Why don't you come over here...

26:59.064 --> 26:59.894
Why don't you guys
just stop it?

26:59.932 --> 27:01.524
Dylan...

27:01.566 --> 27:03.363
please take this somewhere else.

27:03.402 --> 27:06.303
Etiquette was never really
Dylan's strong suit.

27:06.338 --> 27:07.999
That's Brenda's Dylan?

27:08.040 --> 27:09.405
Kelly's Dylan, oh.

27:09.441 --> 27:10.408
You know, Nat said

27:10.442 --> 27:11.841
l was pushing everybody away.

27:11.877 --> 27:14.368
l want you both to look,
'cause here they all are.

27:14.413 --> 27:16.904
You make me sick.

27:16.949 --> 27:19.213
God.

27:19.318 --> 27:21.912
lt's great to have friends.

27:35.600 --> 27:37.067
Sorry, l got to go.

27:37.102 --> 27:39.400
Oh, look, this is for you.

27:39.438 --> 27:41.065
Thanks, l appreciate it.

27:47.079 --> 27:48.603
Macallan neat.

27:48.647 --> 27:50.808
Don't be stingy, huh?

27:52.551 --> 27:54.519
Hey, Jess.

27:54.553 --> 27:55.850
Hey, Dylan.

27:55.887 --> 27:57.252
How you doing, man?

27:57.289 --> 27:59.416
l figured you'd be in some
swanky law office by now.

27:59.458 --> 28:00.925
Well, l'm still
going to law school,

28:00.959 --> 28:02.620
and with Hannah
arriving early,

28:02.661 --> 28:04.561
flexibility got
to be kind of key.

28:04.596 --> 28:06.120
-Yeah.
-Besides,

28:06.164 --> 28:07.392
the tips are excellent.

28:07.432 --> 28:09.263
That's what it's
all about, isn't it?

28:11.570 --> 28:13.333
l've got this.

28:13.372 --> 28:15.863
The benefits
of knowing a bartender.

28:21.380 --> 28:22.711
What are you doing?

28:22.748 --> 28:24.978
Man, l can't serve you.

28:25.017 --> 28:26.678
Why can't you serve me?

28:26.718 --> 28:28.549
Come on, man, l know
you're underage.

28:28.587 --> 28:29.952
So give me some other guy.

28:29.988 --> 28:32.821
Here, let me get this for you.

28:32.858 --> 28:33.984
l'm sorry,

28:34.026 --> 28:35.459
it doesn't work that way.

28:37.095 --> 28:38.926
Works for me.

28:38.964 --> 28:40.727
Come on, man, what are you
trying to do?

28:40.766 --> 28:42.631
You want to get me fired?

28:42.667 --> 28:44.635
Jesse,
do we have a problem here?

28:44.669 --> 28:46.193
Yeah, l'm afraid we do.

28:46.238 --> 28:47.762
Yeah, we do, it's terrible.

28:47.806 --> 28:49.103
You see,
someone's crossed a lawyer

28:49.141 --> 28:50.836
with a bartender.

28:50.876 --> 28:54.039
Hey, just relax, okay,
l think l can hand...

28:54.079 --> 28:55.376
Hey,

28:55.414 --> 28:57.746
you know, there are better ways
to get a drink.

28:57.783 --> 29:00.581
Sweetheart, l am all ears.

29:00.619 --> 29:02.348
l hope not all ears.

29:03.922 --> 29:05.389
Shall we?

29:08.860 --> 29:12.193
Give that to a real bartender
if you see one.

29:22.407 --> 29:24.375
Hey, Brandon.

29:24.409 --> 29:25.376
You want some?

29:25.410 --> 29:28.868
No, thanks, l'm beat.

29:30.916 --> 29:33.043
l didn't think you were
coming home tonight.

29:33.085 --> 29:35.679
Well, Kelly decided
she wanted a little quiet time

29:35.720 --> 29:37.813
after the Dylan incident.

29:37.856 --> 29:38.982
l bet.

29:39.024 --> 29:41.117
ls he always like that?

29:41.159 --> 29:44.185
You mean condescending
and belligerent?

29:44.229 --> 29:46.220
Well, l thought he
was kind of dashing.

29:47.532 --> 29:50.797
ln a condescending, belligerent
sort of way, of course.

29:50.836 --> 29:53.896
lf l were you, l'd stay away
from Dylan for a while.

29:53.939 --> 29:56.908
That's a strange thing to say
about one of your best friends.

29:59.845 --> 30:01.870
Dylan's an alcoholic,
and to tell you the truth,

30:01.913 --> 30:04.245
l'd really rather not get
into any of that right now.

30:04.349 --> 30:06.214
No problem.

30:06.251 --> 30:09.550
So... how'd you like
our little benefit?

30:09.588 --> 30:12.182
l felt like Cinderella
at a ball.

30:12.224 --> 30:14.249
-Steve showed you a good time?
-Yeah.

30:14.292 --> 30:16.260
He's taking me to registration
at C.U. tomorrow.

30:16.328 --> 30:17.955
Cheap date, but it's a start.

30:18.997 --> 30:20.487
He kind of badgered me into it,

30:20.532 --> 30:23.092
but how can you say no
to registration?

30:23.135 --> 30:25.603
Listen.

30:25.637 --> 30:26.797
Steve's a...

30:26.838 --> 30:31.673
really good guy and
he's a good friend.

30:31.710 --> 30:33.541
And he asked you
to tell me that, right?

30:33.578 --> 30:35.170
Yeah.

30:35.213 --> 30:39.741
Don't worry,
l'll take it under advisement.

30:39.784 --> 30:41.752
'Night, Brandon.

30:48.793 --> 30:49.760
Hi, Mom.

30:49.794 --> 30:50.783
Hi, honey.

30:50.829 --> 30:51.921
You want some tea?

30:51.963 --> 30:53.260
Thanks.

30:53.298 --> 30:55.129
Travis is settled
in at his hotel.

30:55.167 --> 30:56.964
He says good-bye.

30:57.002 --> 30:58.993
He could have stayed
here with us.

30:59.037 --> 31:00.664
Yeah, l, l kept
telling him that,

31:00.705 --> 31:03.640
but his plane leaves
so early in the morning,

31:03.675 --> 31:06.235
he didn't want
to disrupt anyone.

31:06.344 --> 31:07.675
Oh.

31:07.712 --> 31:10.408
lt's nice to know one of
your friends is considerate.

31:12.083 --> 31:15.052
Mom, Kelly explained
what happened.

31:15.086 --> 31:16.144
Dylan came in,

31:16.188 --> 31:17.985
he saw her and Brandon
kissing, and...

31:18.023 --> 31:19.422
he kind of blew up.

31:19.457 --> 31:24.394
l see. So, uh, Kelly can't
control her impulses,

31:24.429 --> 31:26.397
and her ex-boyfriend,

31:26.431 --> 31:29.093
who is a bad drunk,
can't control himself.

31:29.134 --> 31:31.466
Mom, l'm so sorry.

31:31.503 --> 31:33.596
l had no idea
this was going to happen.

31:33.638 --> 31:36.038
These people were our guests.

31:36.074 --> 31:38.372
Their behavior reflects
on all of us.

31:38.410 --> 31:41.902
l want to tell you
something my mother told me.

31:41.947 --> 31:43.278
lt might sound
quaint, but...

31:43.381 --> 31:47.442
it's helped me
through the years.

31:47.485 --> 31:50.420
Always remember who you are
and what you represent.

31:51.456 --> 31:54.653
l'll try.

31:54.693 --> 31:58.094
l mean, what may have been
acceptable when you were 14

31:58.129 --> 32:01.098
just isn't going
to work anymore.

32:03.101 --> 32:05.968
But l, l didn't do
anything wrong.

32:06.004 --> 32:08.370
Let's talk about it
tomorrow, all right?

32:08.406 --> 32:09.373
What?

32:09.407 --> 32:10.601
What did l do wrong?

32:10.642 --> 32:13.873
Well, you made quite
a spectacle of yourself

32:13.912 --> 32:16.346
dancing with that basketball
player. Don't you think?

32:16.381 --> 32:21.080
Mom, D'Shawn has been a
very good friend to me.

32:21.119 --> 32:23.349
ln fact, he's practically the
only friend l made last year.

32:23.388 --> 32:24.616
l understand that.

32:24.656 --> 32:27.250
All l'm saying is,
you need to be realistic.

32:27.292 --> 32:28.589
People talk.

32:28.627 --> 32:29.753
Well, l'm sorry,
but if the sight

32:29.794 --> 32:32.661
of me dancing with a black man
offends someone,

32:32.697 --> 32:33.925
then that's their problem.

32:33.965 --> 32:38.368
No, sweetheart,
that's our problem, too.

32:38.403 --> 32:40.428
The world we live in
may be flawed,

32:40.472 --> 32:42.770
but if you want to be an adult,

32:42.807 --> 32:45.275
and you want to be formally
introduced to society,

32:45.310 --> 32:47.244
you just can't be naive.

32:49.281 --> 32:51.875
Can we at least
agree on that?

32:54.152 --> 32:57.280
Yeah, if you say so.

32:57.322 --> 32:58.880
Good.

32:58.923 --> 33:01.619
Then, let's just put
tonight behind us, huh?

33:01.660 --> 33:05.027
We've got a full
fall season ahead.

33:16.274 --> 33:18.105
Dylan, open the door.

33:23.948 --> 33:25.779
Hi, how are you?

33:25.817 --> 33:27.250
What's going on?

33:27.319 --> 33:28.411
Technically,

33:28.453 --> 33:30.717
l think they call it
a ''relapse.''

33:30.755 --> 33:33.417
But it's expected, so l wouldn't
worry about it if l were you.

33:33.458 --> 33:35.085
You know what that stuff
does to you.

33:35.126 --> 33:37.356
At the risk
of sounding glib, Kel,

33:37.395 --> 33:38.657
that's why l drink.

33:38.697 --> 33:40.665
l hate to see you like this.

33:40.699 --> 33:42.963
Put some clothes on.

33:43.001 --> 33:44.491
We'll go get some coffee
and talk.

33:47.138 --> 33:49.163
Um, Eberlee...

33:49.207 --> 33:50.834
this is Kelly.

33:50.875 --> 33:53.275
You didn't tell me
you were married.

33:53.311 --> 33:54.608
We're not.

33:54.646 --> 33:56.637
She just stopped by,
you know, for what?

33:56.681 --> 33:58.672
Coffee? To talk?

33:58.717 --> 34:00.480
What were we doing?

34:00.518 --> 34:01.644
What was that called?

34:01.686 --> 34:03.210
Body shots.

34:03.321 --> 34:04.913
Yeah, ''body shots.''

34:04.956 --> 34:07.049
First, the salt.

34:10.428 --> 34:11.759
Mmm.

34:17.635 --> 34:19.694
Are we even yet?

34:22.774 --> 34:23.934
Ooh.

34:25.643 --> 34:27.907
l can't believe l came here
to apologize to you.

34:27.946 --> 34:29.436
Mnh-mnh.

34:29.481 --> 34:31.380
Not after two years
of psych class, Kel.

34:31.416 --> 34:33.850
You can't expect me to believe
you came to some guy's house

34:33.885 --> 34:36.649
at 2:00 in the morning
to apologize.

34:38.690 --> 34:39.850
lt's over.

34:39.891 --> 34:41.358
lt's so over.

34:44.228 --> 34:46.322
So what'd you come here for?!

35:09.454 --> 35:10.751
Valerie!

35:10.789 --> 35:12.450
Steve's here!

35:13.825 --> 35:15.759
Even my father was
shocked to see Dylan

35:15.794 --> 35:17.159
swilling wine out
of the bottle.

35:17.195 --> 35:19.595
Mrs. Martin, she practically
had herself a heart attack.

35:19.631 --> 35:22.225
l can't believe Brandon
didn't mention any of this.

35:22.300 --> 35:24.029
Hey! What didn't Brandon
mention?

35:24.068 --> 35:25.399
Oh, the incredible ruckus

35:25.437 --> 35:28.600
-at the benefit.
-And on a school night no less.

35:28.640 --> 35:29.766
So Steve, you ready?

35:29.808 --> 35:31.605
-Ready, willing and able.
-Okay.

35:31.643 --> 35:32.974
Good luck, you two.

35:33.011 --> 35:35.445
Oh, and l'll be on campus
if you need a ride back.

35:35.480 --> 35:37.072
Actually, l was hoping
you'd consider me

35:37.115 --> 35:38.742
your own personal chauffeur.

35:38.783 --> 35:40.410
Just what a girl
needs in Beverly Hills,

35:40.452 --> 35:41.919
her own car and driver.

35:41.953 --> 35:44.251
And Brandon can always
be there for you in a pinch.

35:44.355 --> 35:46.255
-Where is Brandon anyway?
-Oh, uh,

35:46.357 --> 35:47.756
he got a call
from Kelly and took off.

35:47.792 --> 35:49.123
l assume he is with her.

36:00.905 --> 36:02.896
Wake up, McKay.

36:04.776 --> 36:06.767
Dylan, wake up.

36:11.282 --> 36:13.409
How'd you get in?

36:13.451 --> 36:14.918
Door was open.

36:14.953 --> 36:16.318
Someone left you
a fan letter.

36:16.354 --> 36:18.345
Put some clothes on,
l'll be outside.

36:28.399 --> 36:30.560
Nice mess you've made here.

36:30.602 --> 36:33.332
Nobody's asking you to stay.

36:33.371 --> 36:36.704
Look, Dylan, you can drink
all you want,

36:36.741 --> 36:40.472
you can pull whatever
self-destructive trip you want,

36:40.512 --> 36:42.810
but you can't treat Kelly
like you did last night.

36:44.449 --> 36:47.179
Whatever problem you've got
with her and me, get over it.

36:47.218 --> 36:49.243
Okay, put something in writing,
l'll sign it.

36:49.320 --> 36:50.844
l'm gonna go back to bed.

36:50.889 --> 36:53.084
No, no, no, hey--
we're gonna clear this up.

36:53.124 --> 36:54.250
Okay, clear this up for me.

36:54.359 --> 36:56.350
What'd you come
over here for the other day?

36:56.394 --> 36:58.487
You didn't even have the guts
to tell me the truth.

36:58.530 --> 36:59.895
You were drinking.

36:59.931 --> 37:02.195
Yeah. You still lied to me.

37:03.434 --> 37:04.867
l was trying to make things
easier on you,

37:04.903 --> 37:07.736
but, okay...

37:07.772 --> 37:09.171
l was wrong.

37:09.207 --> 37:11.198
Thank you, Brandon.

37:11.276 --> 37:13.141
Look,

37:13.177 --> 37:15.907
if you've got a problem
with me, that's fine.

37:15.947 --> 37:20.384
But Kelly only came over here
because she cares about you.

37:20.418 --> 37:22.409
You owe her an apology.

37:32.297 --> 37:34.492
lf you need any
extra diapers,

37:34.532 --> 37:36.193
there should be some more
in the side pocket

37:36.234 --> 37:37.997
with the rattle
and the pacifier.

37:38.036 --> 37:39.833
Great, thanks.

37:39.871 --> 37:42.237
Oh, and also, this morning
she had a little mucous,

37:42.273 --> 37:43.831
but the nurse at the health
center said it was clear,

37:43.875 --> 37:45.206
so it shouldn't be a problem.

37:45.243 --> 37:47.905
Good, that just
about does it, then.

37:47.946 --> 37:49.641
Great, um, l'll be
back really soon.

37:49.681 --> 37:51.945
l pre-registered
for most of my classes.

37:51.983 --> 37:53.473
You do what you have to do.

37:53.518 --> 37:55.952
We'll be right here taking
good care of little Anna.

37:55.987 --> 37:57.545
lt's Hannah.

37:57.589 --> 37:58.681
Excuse me?

37:58.723 --> 38:00.088
-With an ''H.''
-l'm sorry.

38:00.124 --> 38:02.058
Let me change
the card right now.

38:02.093 --> 38:03.560
Hannah Vasquez.

38:03.595 --> 38:07.827
That's Hannah Zuckerman Vasquez,
with a ''Z.''

38:07.865 --> 38:10.129
l'll have to get another card.

38:10.168 --> 38:11.692
l'll wait.

38:13.605 --> 38:15.197
How's everything
going, Andrea?

38:15.273 --> 38:17.104
Not too many first-day
jitters, l hope.

38:17.141 --> 38:18.199
No. We're doing great.

38:18.276 --> 38:19.368
Hmm, don't worry.

38:19.410 --> 38:21.139
Babies thrive
in this program.

38:21.179 --> 38:23.443
Before you know it,
she'll be crawling

38:23.481 --> 38:25.449
and walking
and talking up a storm.

38:25.483 --> 38:27.075
After a while, you'll
hardly recognize her.

38:27.118 --> 38:28.517
She'll be so big.

38:30.188 --> 38:32.179
lsn't she adorable?

38:37.595 --> 38:39.119
-Hi.
-Hi.

38:39.163 --> 38:40.357
How are you doing?

38:40.398 --> 38:41.660
Better than last night.

38:41.699 --> 38:43.633
Um, is Kelly here?

38:43.668 --> 38:45.602
No. Actually l was
looking for her myself.

38:45.637 --> 38:47.036
Her stuff's gone;
she must've already

38:47.071 --> 38:48.698
headed off to registration.

38:48.740 --> 38:50.731
Come in.

38:52.977 --> 38:56.208
l, uh, l came
to talk to Kel.

38:56.247 --> 38:59.614
Since she's not here,
l guess l can start with you.

38:59.651 --> 39:01.448
Look, you don't owe
me any apologies.

39:02.854 --> 39:04.719
l know what it's like to see
someone you care about

39:04.756 --> 39:05.780
with someone else.

39:07.058 --> 39:09.390
Actually, l felt
pretty bad for you.

39:09.427 --> 39:11.895
l don't think
your mother felt so bad.

39:11.929 --> 39:14.989
Yeah, well, my mother and l

39:15.033 --> 39:17.399
don't feel the same way about
a lot of things these days.

39:17.435 --> 39:19.198
Donna, you're not your mother.

39:19.303 --> 39:21.897
l know.

39:21.939 --> 39:24.669
l just wish l had
found that out sooner.

39:24.709 --> 39:26.836
l was kind of counting
on hiding out

39:26.878 --> 39:29.506
on her party circuit,
and now l can't.

39:29.547 --> 39:32.448
Dylan, it's still
so hard to see David.

39:33.785 --> 39:36.015
You know, l thought it
would stop, but it hasn't.

39:36.054 --> 39:39.490
And l just-- l feel like
l have no place else to go.

39:41.392 --> 39:43.326
l'm sorry.

39:43.361 --> 39:45.795
Hey, what are you
sorry for? Come on.

39:47.999 --> 39:51.435
l just... l should have
done something different.

39:51.469 --> 39:55.769
l just-- l go over it
and over it.

39:55.807 --> 39:58.207
You could have done
everything perfect,

39:58.242 --> 40:00.005
and David would
still have ended up

40:00.044 --> 40:02.103
in the back of that
car with that girl.

40:04.148 --> 40:06.446
l just don't know
if l can go back to school,

40:06.484 --> 40:08.384
knowing David's
going to be there.

40:08.419 --> 40:11.115
What are you talking about?
David Silver?

40:11.155 --> 40:12.622
Skinny David Silver?

40:12.657 --> 40:15.820
l mean, one guy on
a campus of what, 14,000?

40:18.162 --> 40:19.720
l know. lt sounds crazy.

40:19.764 --> 40:21.959
l'll tell you what sounds crazy.

40:21.999 --> 40:24.433
A girl like you being
here all by yourself.

40:24.469 --> 40:26.300
Your friends are
somewhere else.

40:27.672 --> 40:29.401
Will you come
to registration with me?

40:29.440 --> 40:31.704
l mean...

40:31.743 --> 40:33.711
maybe if we face him
together.

40:33.745 --> 40:35.576
Please?

40:37.014 --> 40:38.641
l'll meet you there.

40:38.683 --> 40:40.674
Okay.

40:44.922 --> 40:47.618
So are you ready for this?

40:47.658 --> 40:49.558
l liked the summer.

40:49.594 --> 40:52.825
lt was quiet and warm,
and just us.

40:52.864 --> 40:55.355
Well, this is nice, too.

41:00.438 --> 41:02.668
You know, with Dylan
falling off the wagon

41:02.707 --> 41:04.902
and blowing off
college, per usual,

41:04.942 --> 41:07.604
l feel disgustingly wholesome.

41:07.645 --> 41:09.977
You don't know how
attractive that is.

41:10.014 --> 41:12.244
Feel free to tell
me any time.

41:12.283 --> 41:14.808
Well, it's nice to see
familiar faces.

41:14.852 --> 41:17.446
Clare! What are you
doing here?

41:17.488 --> 41:19.581
Uh, registering.

41:19.624 --> 41:22.388
This wouldn't happen to have
anything to do with, uh...

41:22.426 --> 41:23.950
No, it has nothing to do
with you.

41:25.096 --> 41:26.256
Unless of course
you're

41:26.297 --> 41:27.764
the one that gave me
a full year of credit

41:27.799 --> 41:28.993
for my AP classes.

41:29.033 --> 41:31.024
You're a sophomore?

41:31.068 --> 41:33.002
Just like you.

41:33.037 --> 41:34.732
So what are you taking?

41:34.772 --> 41:36.797
Well...

41:36.841 --> 41:38.138
these look pretty good to me.

41:43.748 --> 41:46.945
l got Mr. Sass for Psychology.

41:46.984 --> 41:48.952
Lou?

41:48.986 --> 41:50.112
What do you mean ''Lou''?

41:50.154 --> 41:51.621
What are you, on a first
name basis with him?

41:51.656 --> 41:54.250
l don't know
where the class is.

41:54.292 --> 41:55.816
-Listen, l'll see you later.
-Excuse me, is this

41:55.860 --> 41:59.296
where you sign up to learn
how to write sleazy exposés?

41:59.397 --> 42:01.524
lt's called
investigative reporting.

42:01.566 --> 42:03.431
They give Pulitzers
for this stuff.

42:03.467 --> 42:05.458
l'll see you later.

42:07.305 --> 42:09.830
So, Josh, how do you expect
to have time for the paper

42:09.874 --> 42:11.569
with you and l running
the student government?

42:11.609 --> 42:12.837
You're serious?

42:12.877 --> 42:15.004
l was hoping
for a little more enthusiasm.

42:15.046 --> 42:16.707
Rah.

42:16.747 --> 42:18.476
Thanks.

42:23.154 --> 42:25.145
Jesse, l just changed
my mind, that's all.

42:25.189 --> 42:27.521
lt-lt's no big deal.

42:27.558 --> 42:30.026
Can we talk about this
after school?

42:30.061 --> 42:31.050
All right.

42:31.095 --> 42:33.393
l have the same classes.

42:33.431 --> 42:34.955
That's cool,
l'll call you later.

42:34.999 --> 42:36.159
All right, bye.

42:38.636 --> 42:39.762
Hello, David.

42:39.804 --> 42:40.930
Hey, Donna.

42:40.972 --> 42:43.566
Steve told me you were
taking the semester off.

42:43.608 --> 42:45.906
Nope. Here l am.

42:45.943 --> 42:48.468
So does that mean
you forgive me?

42:48.512 --> 42:50.742
No.

42:50.781 --> 42:52.976
lt means it's a big campus.

42:53.017 --> 42:54.211
You have a nice semester.

42:56.254 --> 42:58.245
You, too.

43:08.299 --> 43:10.597
So, is my old room
still available?

43:10.635 --> 43:13.103
lt's waiting for you.

43:13.137 --> 43:14.331
l haven't changed anything

43:14.372 --> 43:15.930
'cause l was hoping
you'd come back.

43:15.973 --> 43:17.941
l know. l was there
this morning.

43:17.975 --> 43:19.237
So was Dylan.

43:19.277 --> 43:20.767
What was Dylan doing there?

43:20.811 --> 43:22.472
He was looking for you.

43:22.513 --> 43:23.605
To apologize.

43:25.149 --> 43:26.446
lt's a little late
for apologies.

43:26.484 --> 43:27.473
Come on, Kelly.

43:27.518 --> 43:28.507
He wants to come back,

43:28.552 --> 43:30.383
start over with everyone.

43:30.421 --> 43:32.218
He's meeting me here today
to register.

43:33.758 --> 43:35.623
Just give him a chance.
