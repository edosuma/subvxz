00:01.000 --> 00:03.961
One of my friends, um, called
me on Skype one day, and said,

00:03.961 --> 00:07.422
"Hey, have you seen this
show?"And I'm like, "no."

00:07.423 --> 00:10.884
She's like, "well, it's called My
Little Pony: Friendship is Magic,"

00:10.885 --> 00:15.006
"and it's... the internet is raving about it,
you have got to see this show, it's so good."

00:15.014 --> 00:19.794
And I was like, "My Little
Pony... My Little Pony..."

00:19.894 --> 00:22.020
I'm like, "isn't that like
a show for little girls?"

00:22.021 --> 00:24.606
And she's like, "yeah, yeah, yeah,
but it's great, it's great, trust me."

00:24.607 --> 00:27.851
I watch it for a little bit, and
I think, huh, this isn't too bad.

00:27.861 --> 00:33.392
So, I put on another one, and
another one, and another one.

00:33.491 --> 00:36.618
The characters would speak, and
they would end up with a smile,

00:36.619 --> 00:39.059
and I would smile back at
them because it was just,

00:39.164 --> 00:42.207
it was such a good, it
was such a little thing,

00:42.208 --> 00:44.501
but it would make my day
just to see them smile.

00:44.502 --> 00:46.904
It teaches so many good things.

00:46.963 --> 00:49.673
And the next thing I know, I was kind
of leaning forward into my monitor,

00:49.674 --> 00:52.759
and I was like, "this,
this show is amazing."

00:52.760 --> 00:56.096
And I thought, maybe I'm the
only one who knows about this.

00:56.097 --> 00:57.890
Maybe I should
start telling people.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.214
After at some point, I
was like, wait a second.

01:00.643 --> 01:05.173
My Little Pony, I am getting
excited about My Little Pony.

01:05.607 --> 01:08.726
So she's like, "Okay,
so are you a Brony?"

01:08.902 --> 01:11.278
I'm like, "Well what's that?"

01:11.279 --> 01:15.157
And she's like, "There's this
huge movement of, you know,"

01:15.158 --> 01:19.203
"guys, you know, in high school and
college that are just so into the show."

01:19.204 --> 01:23.040
"And they're goin' to cons, and they're
like, making music, and you know, art."

01:23.041 --> 01:25.876
And so she's like, "Are you,
would you call yourself a Brony?"

01:25.877 --> 01:28.712
"Would you, you know, be willing to
like just check out more of this stuff?"

01:28.713 --> 01:33.842
And I'm like, "Yeah, yeah!
I'd call myself a Brony, yeah."

01:33.843 --> 01:35.844
It was then that I became a Brony.

01:35.845 --> 01:36.511
I'm a Brony.

01:36.512 --> 01:37.179
I'm a Brony.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.640
And that's when I knew
that I was a Brony.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.433
I, I want to become a Brony.

01:41.434 --> 01:42.643
And I am a Brony.

01:42.644 --> 01:45.103
I'm a Brony too.

01:45.104 --> 01:46.438
- Another disturbing trend,
- Yes.

01:46.439 --> 01:51.060
- Uh, Bronies, grown men,
who love My Little Pony.
- Oh, wow.

01:51.236 --> 01:52.903
I think I'd ask if they were gay.

01:52.904 --> 01:54.571
Old men, like pedophiles.

01:54.572 --> 01:56.198
It's a little mind-boggling.

01:56.199 --> 01:57.282
More flamboyant.

01:57.283 --> 01:58.283
He dresses like a girl.

01:58.284 --> 01:59.368
It's pretty weird.

01:59.369 --> 02:01.146
Creeps. [LAUGHS]

02:01.287 --> 02:04.206
I've never watched a single
episode of My Little Pony.

02:04.207 --> 02:06.541
There's definitely
sexual deviancy involved.

02:06.542 --> 02:07.084
Creepy.

02:07.085 --> 02:10.211
- There are worse hobbies for a young lad to have,
- [LAUGHS]

02:10.213 --> 02:11.505
Like, you know, terrorism.

02:11.506 --> 02:14.883
- If, am I wrong?
- Bronies, I don't know, that's on the edge.

02:14.884 --> 02:15.634
Pretty twisted.

02:15.635 --> 02:18.637
This, this phenomenon
of Brony conventions

02:18.638 --> 02:21.390
clearly was foretold in
the Book of Revelation.

02:21.391 --> 02:24.434
This is it, we are
toast, it is over,

02:24.435 --> 02:27.884

[MUSIC STARTING] [TROTTING HOOVES]

02:49.669 --> 02:52.296
For one to fully comprehend
this pony fascination,

02:52.297 --> 02:55.590
Let me first sum up the
previous of pony generations.

02:55.591 --> 02:57.884
Generation 1 appeared
on TV in the 80's.

02:57.885 --> 03:01.221
It was made to sell toys,
plots were hardly very weighty.

03:01.222 --> 03:03.807
And Generation 2, I do not
mean to grouse and gripe,

03:03.808 --> 03:07.019
But these characters fell right
into the girly stereotypes.

03:07.020 --> 03:11.189
And Generation 3 is just
too awful and too tragic.

03:11.190 --> 03:17.688
So let's jump to number 4,.
Where Friendship is Magic!

03:18.531 --> 03:21.491
All the characters compelling
and the stellar storytelling,

03:21.492 --> 03:25.817
And the lovely animation
brought about great dedication!

03:25.913 --> 03:28.832
This is where we meet the Bronies,
for they like My Little Pony.

03:28.833 --> 03:32.169
Yes the bros enjoy the ponies
so let's go and meet the Bronies!

[FILM STRIP ROLLING]

03:44.807 --> 03:49.311
I love flying. The
airport is my second home.

03:49.312 --> 03:54.483
It's the greatest passion, because it
adds a, a third dimension to your life.

03:54.484 --> 03:58.605
People who limit themselves to the
ground are, are missing out a lot,

03:58.905 --> 04:02.699
because the world is just completely
different, up there and, uh,

04:02.700 --> 04:04.977
it's just total freedom.

04:07.205 --> 04:11.333
What I'd usually be doing right now
is grabbing my friends Chris and Ethan,

04:11.334 --> 04:15.739
we'll just go out to a local pizza
joint, we'll just go be teenagers.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.257
We just eat there, and
then we'll go to Wal-Mart,

04:19.257 --> 04:22.258
'cause that's the thing to do
around here, is just go to Wal-Mart.

04:22.428 --> 04:24.554
That's considered a hot
date around this area.

04:24.555 --> 04:27.075
The rednecks will take their
girlfriends to Wal-Mart.

04:27.350 --> 04:30.560
And this is one of the only places
I can come and buy Pony Merch.

04:30.561 --> 04:35.933
I have a, a friend in there, he
lets me know when the stuff comes in.

04:36.025 --> 04:39.144
I'm waiting to receive a
text for that White Celestia,

04:39.362 --> 04:41.389
I'm excited for her.

04:46.244 --> 04:47.953
It's fun to drive a
Mercedes because you,

04:47.954 --> 04:51.498
you're usually the only one that has
one, especially an old one like this one.

04:51.499 --> 04:54.584
I get a lot of weird looks from
the rednecks, cause you know,

04:54.585 --> 04:57.295
they're expecting me to be
driving a big truck, or, you know,

04:57.296 --> 05:00.257
I'm supposed to be competing
with them somehow, and

05:00.258 --> 05:02.752
I don't, I don't
see the fun in that.

05:02.802 --> 05:08.223
My first exposure to My Little Pony was
in a, uh, an internet video collaboration,

05:08.224 --> 05:12.018
and this guy, he had created a
collaboration of the good shows,

05:12.019 --> 05:14.563
that got a start in in 2010, and,

05:14.564 --> 05:18.608
I saw the, the ponies on there, and I'm,
I just couldn't get them out of my head.

05:18.609 --> 05:20.944
Like something just
caught my eye about 'em.

05:20.945 --> 05:23.745
I don't know why, so I figured,
well, I'll give 'em a chance.

05:23.906 --> 05:25.933
I gave it a shot, and I was hooked.

05:27.034 --> 05:28.856
Spike, take a note please.

05:28.870 --> 05:32.664
I, Princess Celestia,
hereby decree,

05:32.665 --> 05:37.696
that the unicorn Twilight Sparkle shall
take on a new mission for Equestria.

05:37.753 --> 05:40.422
She must continue to study
the magic of friendship.

05:40.423 --> 05:46.219

from her new home in Ponyville.

[CHEERING] [MUSIC]

05:56.439 --> 06:00.066
I was like, no, there's no way I'm
watching this little girl's show.

06:00.067 --> 06:03.570
I can't be likin' this, you know
that's, that's not right, you know.

06:03.571 --> 06:05.864
But something about it
just kept me coming to it.

06:05.865 --> 06:10.285
The show itself, of course is about the magic
of friendship, hence, Friendship is Magic.

06:10.286 --> 06:13.288
And what really speaks
to me as a grown man is,

06:13.289 --> 06:17.417
that these characters are so deep
and in-depth, and complicated,

06:17.418 --> 06:20.196
while they each portray
an Element of Harmony.

06:20.338 --> 06:24.413
The spirits of the Elements
of Harmony are right here!

06:24.717 --> 06:30.624
Honesty! Loyalty! Laughter!
Kindness! Generosity!

06:30.848 --> 06:33.225
When those elements
are ignited by the...

06:33.226 --> 06:36.186
the 'spark', that resides
in the heart of us all,

06:36.187 --> 06:41.093
it creates the sixth
element, the element of magic!

06:41.150 --> 06:44.444
I wanted to have a show
about six characters,

06:44.445 --> 06:46.112
six girls, six ponies,

06:46.113 --> 06:48.406
who were friends with one another.

06:48.407 --> 06:51.368
I already wanted Princess
Celestia, I already wanted

06:51.369 --> 06:54.412
Twilight to be her
student who was displaced.

06:54.413 --> 06:58.542
I had her, in Mork and
Mindy style, write letters

06:58.543 --> 07:02.420
surmising what she learned about
friendship at the end of the episode.

07:02.421 --> 07:04.422
Dear Princess Celestia.

07:04.423 --> 07:07.717
This adventure has taught me to
never lose faith in your friends.

07:07.718 --> 07:10.053

source of strength,

07:10.054 --> 07:13.298

even your greatest fears.

07:28.948 --> 07:32.742
I'm one of those people who
can be attached to objects,

07:32.743 --> 07:36.989
particularly one which I had which
was a toy aircraft carrier, 'cause

07:37.790 --> 07:40.250
I always thought it
was just cool, and

07:40.251 --> 07:41.835
it was my favorite toy for a while.

07:41.836 --> 07:45.088
But um, it eventually got
yard saled, and I got over it,

07:45.089 --> 07:47.591
obviously, because
I have to grow up.

07:47.592 --> 07:51.553
I mean I can't, I can't be
like 50 or something, and like

07:51.554 --> 07:55.390
all alone in my house with just a
toy aircraft carrier going, "yes".

07:55.391 --> 07:57.714
This, I'm probably
never gonna sell.

07:58.644 --> 08:04.649
Lyle is very creative, very artistic.
He enjoys building with LEGO.

08:04.650 --> 08:07.736
He enjoys games on the computer,

08:07.737 --> 08:11.364
such as the Minecraft,
Halo, that kind of thing.

08:11.365 --> 08:13.867

excellent shot, he's,

08:13.868 --> 08:18.398
when it comes to target shooting,
he's got me beat by a long shot.

08:19.165 --> 08:24.836
Before I watched the show,
I was kind of sad and lonely,

08:24.837 --> 08:28.757
and then when I did watch the show,
it opened up to this huge community,

08:28.758 --> 08:33.755
because the community's just so accepting,
and it's just a really great thing.

08:33.763 --> 08:38.350
It's not a show that you'd expect a
lot of people my age and older to watch.

08:38.351 --> 08:42.062
The show does help teach
a lot of life lessons.

08:42.063 --> 08:46.263
There's almost any episode that
can help with almost any situation.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.942

each other the truth.

a lot of situations way better
than I could have before.

09:05.378 --> 09:08.797
He said, "What would you think, mom, if
I really said I liked My Little Pony?"

09:08.798 --> 09:11.132
And he'd been joking
about this for a long time.

09:11.133 --> 09:13.176
I was talking about
how it was a good show,

09:13.177 --> 09:15.500
but her initial reaction
was a bit like "ehhh".

09:15.554 --> 09:18.014
I said, "I'd be worried
about you, Lyle."

09:18.015 --> 09:23.770
it made me kind of nervous, like she
wouldn't really accept it if I was serious.

09:23.771 --> 09:25.438
I didn't think he was serious!

09:25.439 --> 09:27.682
And so I told her it was a joke.

09:27.775 --> 09:30.276
I was very nervous
about my dad finding out.

09:30.277 --> 09:35.729
He might be thinking that I'm
gay, or a man-child or something.

09:36.450 --> 09:39.911

of exploded into, um,

09:39.912 --> 09:42.664
you know musicians and
artists and animators,

09:42.665 --> 09:44.541
and all these people
getting behind the show that,

09:44.542 --> 09:47.866
that they use the content from
the show and build off that.

at Cartoon Network,

moment I met her.

smart, and, and insightful,

12:26.495 --> 12:30.650

she wanted on different things, and...

one day and asked me

12:32.626 --> 12:35.044
if I had played with My Little
Pony toys as a little girl.

'Course I did, I had every
pony, I had every sticker.

12:37.798 --> 12:44.512
And she said, it's been her dream to have
her vision of My Little Pony be on the air,

12:44.513 --> 12:46.264
and could she come over
and show me some stuff?

12:46.265 --> 12:49.544
And I said, sure. So we actually
went upstairs to my little studio.

12:49.643 --> 12:51.519

12:51.520 --> 12:55.607

Applejack for just the pitch.

know, the party girl and really happy,

13:03.073 --> 13:08.119
and she wanted sort of high pitched,
um, really silly girl, girlie girl.

13:08.120 --> 13:12.498
And that she wanted Twilight to be a
little bit more serious, still likeable.

13:12.499 --> 13:17.086
She's sort of the leader of
the ponies, um, and book smart,

13:17.087 --> 13:21.799
and a little bit nerdy, but still
someone that you'd want to hang out with.

13:21.800 --> 13:26.250
And knowing that she had to be,
you know, bookish, but still cute.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.264
Um, and it's right in that
pocket where it's like,

13:28.265 --> 13:31.184
"Dear Princess Celestia,
today I learned..."

13:31.185 --> 13:36.022
And then she'll talk about whatever it
was that her, friendship lesson of the day.

13:36.023 --> 13:38.024
"Your faithful student,
Twilight Sparkle."

13:38.025 --> 13:39.984
Once she heard my
Twilight, she's like,

13:39.985 --> 13:43.389
*[GASP] Oh my gosh, you're...
you're Twilight, that's my Twi.

13:43.614 --> 13:46.908
My Little Pony: Friendship
is Magic is about a bunch of

13:46.909 --> 13:53.908
tiny, little, cute little herbivores, that are
facing down these titanic personified evils.

13:54.124 --> 13:58.044
And, I think some days
we all feel like that.

13:58.045 --> 14:03.201
We all feel like we're just a
little small thing facing down these

14:03.717 --> 14:06.495
huge forces that
are greater than us.

14:18.399 --> 14:21.693
Animals I find much more, like
easier when I'm trying to relax

14:21.694 --> 14:25.564
or that you know, cool down
from talking to a lot of people.

14:29.994 --> 14:34.570
They don't have any sort of major
demands, not emotional demands anyway.

14:34.665 --> 14:39.320
So I feel like they're much easier
to understand and interact with.

14:39.753 --> 14:40.824
Yeah!

14:41.130 --> 14:43.589
When I took him for his
three-year assessment,

14:43.590 --> 14:46.801
I was talking to the health
visitor and Daniel was behind me.

14:46.802 --> 14:49.762
And she said to me,
"Does he always do that?"

14:49.763 --> 14:54.058
And I turned around, and he'd
lined all the chairs up in the room,

14:54.059 --> 14:57.395
right, really straight,
all the way across the room,

14:57.396 --> 15:01.524
which he did with everything; his toys,
video... he used to make a video...

15:01.525 --> 15:05.945
a line from the telly, all the
way into the kitchen, with videos.

15:05.946 --> 15:08.474
And, anything he used to line up.

15:08.657 --> 15:10.783
And so I said, "Yes,
he always does that."

15:10.784 --> 15:12.910
And she said, "I think
we need to have a talk,"

15:12.911 --> 15:16.360
and he was diagnosed
with Asperger's.

15:21.879 --> 15:25.783
Having Asperger's is like...
well, I really can't explain it.

15:26.258 --> 15:30.636
It's basically not being able to understand
maybe people's emotions, at a time,

15:30.637 --> 15:35.463
or understand why someone would
do something on an emotional level.

15:35.893 --> 15:39.012
"Are they sad? Are they
happy? Are they angry?"

15:39.271 --> 15:42.641
Something like that is very difficult
for someone with Asperger's, usually.

15:42.691 --> 15:47.187
Daniel first told me
about six months ago.

15:47.321 --> 15:51.032
I was thinking, "Oh, I like
this show, I want pony stuff."

15:51.033 --> 15:55.661
"How am I going to go about getting them
without telling them anything about it."

15:55.662 --> 16:00.583
So I sort of just sat my mom down and said,
"Okay, I'm gonna tell you something a bit weird."

16:00.584 --> 16:03.203
And I thought, "Oh
my God, what is it?"

16:03.545 --> 16:07.048
Um, and he says, I really like this
program, I want you to watch it,

16:07.049 --> 16:08.951
don't say anything, just watch it.

16:09.676 --> 16:11.623
[TELEVISION] "No distractions."

16:12.930 --> 16:16.129
I was thinking, "Oh my
God, why does he like this?"

16:16.475 --> 16:21.426
And after it had finished, I thought, "Well...
[SIGH] Yeah, I can see why he likes it."

16:21.438 --> 16:23.356
And I thought, "He's gonna
get obsessed with this..."

16:23.357 --> 16:26.859
Soon as I saw it, I knew that he
was... he would be obsessed with it.

16:26.860 --> 16:29.987
The ponies I would most relate
to would probably be Twilight,

16:29.988 --> 16:33.241
because she gets very freaked out
when elements don't go her way.

16:33.242 --> 16:36.869
I mean, I can see a lot of
him in some of the characters.

16:36.870 --> 16:40.873
And so I, I thought, I bet he can see
himself in a lot of the characters.

16:40.874 --> 16:44.919
If something she's trying to achieve goes
out of her control, or that she fails at,

16:44.920 --> 16:48.995
she gets very anxious, or
agitated, or very stressed out.

16:49.258 --> 16:52.385
Or she has a mental, psychological
breakdown, goes crazy.

16:52.386 --> 16:55.881
It looks like some pony's getting
themselves all worked up over nothing.

16:55.973 --> 16:59.172
[KICK] This is not nothing.
This is everything!

16:59.476 --> 17:02.687
I need you guys to help me find some pony
with a problem I can fix before sundown!

17:02.688 --> 17:05.231
[DRAMATIC MUSIC]
My whole life depends on it!

17:05.232 --> 17:06.352
[EXASPERATED SIGH]

17:06.483 --> 17:12.738
I can see obsessive, and, um, not
coping with certain situations,

17:12.739 --> 17:17.242
and I'm- I-I was wondering,
of the episodes I've watched,

17:17.243 --> 17:22.415
whether perhaps one of the script writers
were, or knew somebody with Asperger's.

17:22.415 --> 17:25.114
Because it was, it
was so, so similar.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.986
And magic makes it all complete!

19:14.987 --> 19:16.946
My Little Pony.

19:16.947 --> 19:23.400
Do you know you are
my very best friends!

19:43.682 --> 19:45.975
I'm known as LaserPon3
on the internet.

19:45.976 --> 19:48.185
And I make the laser
pony animations.

19:48.186 --> 19:54.066
When I make a new show, first I start
with a notepad, just a physical notepad

19:54.067 --> 19:59.572
and start writing down everything that I hear
in the song that I associate with the song,

19:59.573 --> 20:03.534
like I hear a sad part, I maybe think of violins,
I maybe think of this, I maybe think of that,

20:03.535 --> 20:08.622
and what write everything down, and I would,
eventually I have a whole paper filled with,

20:08.623 --> 20:11.667
with words, which I then
grab and make a story out of.

20:11.668 --> 20:14.275
And I basically put some
characters from the show,

20:14.301 --> 20:16.422
I put, associate them
with those objects,

20:16.423 --> 20:19.467
I associate them with the
emotions that go on the show.

20:19.468 --> 20:23.012
And in that kind of way I start
developing a very, very thin storyline.

20:23.013 --> 20:28.184
Then I start drawing some frames,
some test frames to see if, you know,

20:28.185 --> 20:32.010
it appears so it doesn't flicker too much,
like the frame rate doesn't drop too much.

20:32.064 --> 20:35.052
From there on I just start making
the show and then, it just...

20:35.078 --> 20:36.359
my mind goes all by itself.

20:36.360 --> 20:39.236
"...Yes, you!"

20:39.237 --> 20:41.856
It requires a lot of
precision, a lot of work.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.784
Uh, you have to make sure that the
three laser beams that come out of,

20:44.785 --> 20:47.703
that are in the projector,
that combine to one beam,

20:47.704 --> 20:50.081
uh, are perfectly
overlapping each other.

20:50.082 --> 20:55.127
For example, a white laser beam
is, you're perceiving it as white,

20:55.128 --> 20:59.032
but it's actually still three separate
laser beams just tightly spaced together.

20:59.299 --> 21:02.885
So every kind of small
mis-alignment will make a difference,

21:02.886 --> 21:04.926
and your audience
will be able to see it.

21:04.930 --> 21:07.431
The Elements of Harmony, are
playing a role in my life,

21:07.432 --> 21:10.518
I think generosity
plays an important part.

21:10.519 --> 21:15.147
You know, making stuff for other people,
like for free just gives me a great feel,

21:15.148 --> 21:17.300
that, that, people
can enjoy what I do.

21:24.491 --> 21:28.536
I was just sitting there, I was just
livin' day to day, you know, in the house,

21:28.537 --> 21:32.123
uh, you know just trying to get by doing
work for my father here and there, and

21:32.124 --> 21:36.710
I didn't really have anything to look
forward to, just you know, to see the sunset,

21:36.711 --> 21:40.206
and that was it, you know,
we'd go to the next day.

21:40.424 --> 21:43.759
As soon as ponies came into my life, I
was like, wow, I never want the day to end,

21:43.760 --> 21:48.757
you know, it's just such a
positive outlook on things.

21:48.807 --> 21:50.891
And now I have something
to look forward to.

21:50.892 --> 21:53.352
Here we have a strong
stereotyping that

21:53.353 --> 21:59.358
if you aren't extremely masculine and
chauvinistic then you're a homosexual,

21:59.359 --> 22:02.979
and in this area homosexuality
is also looked down upon, so

22:03.155 --> 22:05.955
I guess it comes hand in hand
that if you watch a show that's

22:06.116 --> 22:08.701
target audience was
children, small girls,

22:08.702 --> 22:13.414
then suddenly maybe you're homosexual,
and then it's a reason to hate you.

22:13.415 --> 22:17.918
If you choose to be a Brony in the Appalachian
Mountains, you're gonna have problems.

22:17.919 --> 22:20.963
You might get beat up,
you could get cussed at,

22:20.964 --> 22:22.882
you could get things thrown at you.

22:22.883 --> 22:26.036
It's not an easy thing.

22:27.888 --> 22:31.838
One night there was a, uh, a few
rednecks standing around my car,

22:32.058 --> 22:35.686
uh, there was a truck in front of my
car, behind it, so I couldn't move.

22:35.687 --> 22:37.964
They had tire irons, baseball bats.

22:38.231 --> 22:43.152
I had just got uh, custom
decals uh, for my windows,

22:43.153 --> 22:46.780
uh, on my back window I had a
large Celestia and a large Luna,

22:46.781 --> 22:50.822
and they were kneeling up together and forming
an archway and it was just the coolest thing.

22:50.952 --> 22:53.730
Uh, and they went
right to my back window,

22:53.747 --> 22:56.165
hit it a few times
and then, smashed it.

22:56.166 --> 22:56.832
[BREAKING GLASS]

22:56.833 --> 23:00.203
The guy, he ran to his
truck and came back out,

23:00.253 --> 23:03.156
with his rifle he
had been hunting with.

23:03.507 --> 23:05.750
Uh, I got pretty
scared at that point.

23:06.259 --> 23:08.594
You know, he was playfully
aiming it at me like, you know,

23:08.595 --> 23:12.920
"You gonna stop this Pony, your little
gay girly shit!" You know, and uh.

23:14.476 --> 23:17.186
So he pointed it
right at me and I was,

23:17.187 --> 23:19.522
I freaked out, you know I
slammed the car in reverse,

23:19.523 --> 23:23.484
and, you know, just managed to get the
whole side of this car just bashed up.

23:23.485 --> 23:26.737
And then I come home and then of course
my father saw the damage to the car,

23:26.738 --> 23:30.324
and he was, uh, he was a little angry
and I just had to explain to him,

23:30.325 --> 23:33.069
like, "Oh, I ran off the
road" or something, and

23:33.828 --> 23:35.508
you know, to try to cover it up.

23:45.173 --> 23:48.497
We were asked to make
a two part special.

23:48.552 --> 23:51.046
And I wanted it to
be a great big story.

23:51.179 --> 23:55.808
We had this opportunity for a new
villain, so we created Discord,

23:55.809 --> 24:00.563
and when we were writing the
character and we were pitching our, um,

24:00.564 --> 24:04.942
our premise to, to our bosses
at Hasbro and the Hub, you know,

24:04.943 --> 24:08.643
we were tellin' em, "he's like
a trickster kind of character."

24:08.905 --> 24:13.435
They were a little uncertain
at first until, uh, I said,

24:13.577 --> 24:16.453
"He's like Q, from Star Trek!"
[LAUGHS]

24:16.454 --> 24:19.198
And they were like, "[GASP]
Can we get John de Lancie?!"

24:19.416 --> 24:24.211
Keep trying, Twilight Sparkle, maybe
the "Magic of Friendship" can help you!

24:24.212 --> 24:27.965
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some chaos to wreak.

24:27.966 --> 24:32.371
I think the Bronies like Discord
because he's naughty, you know.

24:32.721 --> 24:33.846
And... they're guys.

24:33.847 --> 24:39.143
And I was looking at uh, Greek
mythological characters like chimeras,

24:39.144 --> 24:41.770
and um, uh, manticores.

24:41.771 --> 24:46.776
I wanted all of his body parts to be
from a different animal so that he's,

24:46.802 --> 24:48.203
he's not harmonious.

24:48.653 --> 24:50.571
Ugh, this again?

24:50.572 --> 24:52.519
[SIPS]

24:53.158 --> 24:55.231
[EXPLOSION]

24:55.785 --> 25:00.190
My first introduction to My Little Pony was
I got a call from my agent saying that...

25:00.415 --> 25:01.987
"You have a... a job."

25:02.459 --> 25:06.409
And I read the material, it was very
good, I went in, I knocked it off,

25:07.172 --> 25:09.620
and completely forgot about it.

25:10.258 --> 25:13.761
Three months later I go down
to my computer and I open it up

25:13.762 --> 25:18.008
and there must be, I don't know,
three or four hundred emails.

25:18.391 --> 25:22.394
And they all say uh, "My Little
Pony", and I'm, I call up to my wife

25:22.395 --> 25:24.521
and I said, "What do you
about My Little Pony?"

25:24.522 --> 25:27.524
And she said, "Well you voiced
it about three months ago."

25:27.525 --> 25:29.777
Pretty sure... I completely
forgot about that.

25:29.778 --> 25:32.727
And um, she says, "It's a
program for little girls."

25:33.406 --> 25:35.308
I said "well, let me tell ya..."

25:36.117 --> 25:38.535
"...these aren't little
girls that are writing me."

25:38.536 --> 25:40.412
There's a number of
reasons people love him.

25:40.413 --> 25:44.488
I think they were excited
by how epic that episode was.

25:55.553 --> 25:58.581
It is definitely not a
typical little girls' show.

25:58.848 --> 26:01.376
None of this would be
possible without the internet.

26:01.434 --> 26:04.561
But Bronies now are
starting to get together.

26:04.562 --> 26:07.511
First at meet-ups
and then conventions.

26:07.857 --> 26:10.100
Germany... England...

26:10.777 --> 26:13.145
and the biggest
convention, BronyCon.

26:14.948 --> 26:17.282
So, when I heard about
BronyCon coming up,

26:17.283 --> 26:20.311
I decided that I
really wanted to go.

26:20.453 --> 26:23.789
So I came up with this
plan, with one of my friends.

26:23.790 --> 26:25.999
If I am willing to
pay for the hotel room,

26:26.000 --> 26:29.700
he and his dad would drive
me up and pay for meals.

26:30.004 --> 26:33.799
So, I told my parents that I wanted
to take a trip with one of my friends.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.592
They weren't really
keen on the idea.

26:35.593 --> 26:39.096
They don't really trust me as
far as money goes, and what not,

26:39.097 --> 26:45.675
so they insisted that they
go, if I'm gonna go at all.

26:45.770 --> 26:48.939
So, they kept asking questions,

26:48.940 --> 26:51.400
and I eventually told
them it was a Comic-Con.

26:51.401 --> 26:53.527
So then that just got them
more excited and they were like,

26:53.528 --> 26:54.611
"Oh, well who's gonna be there?"

26:54.612 --> 26:56.739
And I was like, "Well I just
kinda wanna go with my friend."

26:56.740 --> 27:02.488
But yet I couldn't find anything online
about it, as a "comic" convention.

27:02.704 --> 27:06.278
Oh no, my parents,
they're gonna find out!

27:06.541 --> 27:09.334
Then eventually, my mom just, the
curiosity got the better of her,

27:09.335 --> 27:12.546
and she looked it up online, with
all the information I'd given her.

27:12.547 --> 27:14.548
She found out about BronyCon,

27:14.549 --> 27:17.590
and she came downstairs to me one
day with a smug look on her face,

27:17.802 --> 27:21.046
like, asking me to
elaborate, and I did.

27:21.598 --> 27:24.672
And then she told my dad.

27:24.684 --> 27:26.506
He's conservative.

27:26.811 --> 27:28.178
Um...

27:31.191 --> 27:35.095
I guess that's the major word I would
use to describe my husband, conservative.

27:36.196 --> 27:39.691
"Well, it's not
really a Comic-Con."

27:40.450 --> 27:46.983
She says, "Remember uh, back
in the 80's, My Pretty Pony?"

27:47.248 --> 27:49.070
And I went, "Yeah?"

27:49.542 --> 27:52.411
She goes, "it's, like,
something to do with that."

27:52.962 --> 27:54.505
I was like "Huh?"

27:54.506 --> 27:56.829
My dad is very conservative.

27:57.091 --> 28:03.498
I don't know how my dad reacts to me being
a Brony, 'cause he's very quiet about it.

28:19.155 --> 28:22.308
The big reason I'm
coming to BronyCon is that

28:28.581 --> 28:32.193
I am really afraid that
he's going to be, like,

28:32.219 --> 28:35.981
live performing in front
of the audience, because

28:49.310 --> 28:51.562
When I first get there,
like when I'm drivin' in,

28:51.563 --> 28:53.730
I want to be seein' em' all walkin'
in there and I'm gonna be goin',

28:53.731 --> 28:54.898
"Aw man, this is going to be,"

28:54.899 --> 28:58.110
"like almost like going to a rock
concert for your favorite band."

28:58.111 --> 28:59.778
I was like, "Oh man,
I'm gonna be so pumped."

28:59.779 --> 29:03.774
All right, we're going to
New York! That's the money!

29:04.075 --> 29:06.994
The first convention
ever held for Bronies,

29:06.995 --> 29:08.245
there were only 100 people.

29:08.246 --> 29:11.748
And the current one, it's
gonna hit its cap at 4,000.

29:11.749 --> 29:13.696
It's become a global phenomenon.

29:14.085 --> 29:16.086
Well I'm leaving early in
the morning for B.U.C.K.

29:16.087 --> 29:20.913
Now there are dozens of conventions just in
the United States alone, dozens more in Europe.

29:25.179 --> 29:29.975
I first saw the convention
on Equestria Daily I think.

29:29.976 --> 29:33.353
They were talking about
a British Brony con UK.

29:33.354 --> 29:37.190
I saw that and thought, "Brilliant,
I don't have to travel to America."

29:37.191 --> 29:40.569
So I definitely decided straight away
I've got to go to that convention.

29:40.570 --> 29:46.950
He wouldn't have considered going to
a convention about something before.

29:46.951 --> 29:49.953
Pony convention I'm
going to see people.

29:49.954 --> 29:51.914
So yes, that's very ironic because

29:51.915 --> 29:54.791
I wouldn't normally go to
a convention to see people.

29:54.792 --> 29:57.878
He's organized everything himself,
I haven't organized anything.

29:57.879 --> 30:00.088
He wanted to do it
all himself, so yeah.

30:00.089 --> 30:02.132
I think he's... he's
looking forward to it.

30:02.133 --> 30:07.084
Well I plan on getting to the convention
by taking an hour train ride to Manchester.

30:07.597 --> 30:11.433
This is from getting from the train
station to the Bridgewater Hall,

30:11.434 --> 30:13.477
where the Brony con
UK is being hosted.

30:13.478 --> 30:16.104
I don't think I'd be comfortable
asking people for directions.

30:16.105 --> 30:21.181
During my trip I'm trying to cut down as
much interaction with people as possible.

30:22.737 --> 30:26.239
If I was in a large crowd, probably
paranoia would be quite likely.

30:26.240 --> 30:29.117
I'm sort of very aware
of people around me,

30:29.118 --> 30:32.120
because I'm very paranoid
about these sort of things like,

30:32.121 --> 30:34.944
"Oh, what if uh, that guy's
a mugger!" or something.

30:34.999 --> 30:40.337
Things Daniel will face I will find, I think
he will find very hard, are the train station.

30:40.338 --> 30:42.756
Stafford won't be too bad,
but when he gets to Manchester

30:42.757 --> 30:45.706
it's going to be very crowded
which he's gonna find quite hard.

30:47.387 --> 30:52.391
Walking through yeah, a general area such
as Manchester, I get a little jittery.

30:52.392 --> 30:54.590
I start shaking a bit more maybe.

30:54.852 --> 30:58.005
I would tend to want to
rush, like get places faster.

30:58.356 --> 31:03.353
Gonna be anxious because it's not a new
environment, but it's a different environment.

31:03.528 --> 31:05.904
People walking about,
doing different things,

31:05.905 --> 31:08.728
yeah, in an environment
I can't control.

32:38.748 --> 32:43.668
I told my wife, "No
way, just say no."

32:43.669 --> 32:46.379
I think if my dad was to
meet someone at BronyCon,

32:46.380 --> 32:51.218
if he met someone with similar interests,
from the same culture he's used to

32:51.219 --> 32:56.389
and same generation, um, it
would just help to bridge the gap

32:56.390 --> 33:00.102
between him and this
strange new culture shock.

33:00.103 --> 33:03.757
Probably see people with
purple and pink hair, and...

33:04.107 --> 33:07.807
I don't know, satin pink costumes.
[LAUGH]

33:07.902 --> 33:09.569
If only I could get my
dad to watch the show,

33:09.570 --> 33:11.780
he could understand, and
things would be so much better.

33:11.781 --> 33:14.309
I'm not interested in
watching My Little Pony.

33:36.722 --> 33:38.181
So this is just people lining up.

33:38.182 --> 33:42.428
We predict about a thousand to
get their early registration.

33:54.782 --> 33:58.527
My friend Donna did my nails up for
me with her [PINKIE PIE'S] cutie mark.

34:01.914 --> 34:04.749
I took uh, two trains to meet
up with uh some other Bronies,

34:04.750 --> 34:06.042
and then we carpooled over here.

34:06.043 --> 34:08.460
So the total travel time
would be about seven hours.

34:08.462 --> 34:09.920
I love the songs.

34:09.922 --> 34:13.466
And the culture around
the show, is amazing.

34:13.467 --> 34:17.262
I'm in particular looking forward
to seeing and hearing Lauren Faust.

that he decided to voice Discord,

34:21.225 --> 34:23.893
because nopony else could
have done it better than him.

There's harmony present
among all the Bronies here.

[CROWD CHEERING]

FOUR thousand people,

35:18.699 --> 35:22.273
who had a sense that they were being
part of something that was unique.

35:22.453 --> 35:26.983
It was the spirit of that
convention that was so attractive.

35:27.875 --> 35:30.543
The reason I brought my
sister to BronyCon was because

35:30.544 --> 35:34.506
I felt that she would be the kind of person
who would understand this sort of thing.

35:34.507 --> 35:36.216
And, he can't drive.

35:36.217 --> 35:38.218

There is so many people
dressed in fantastic outfits.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.147
It's just jaw dropping.

35:51.148 --> 35:54.484
You also get to meet
the original voice cast,

35:54.485 --> 35:57.445
you get to see what they
think of the Brony culture,

35:57.446 --> 36:00.895
and they are shocked by how
many people have come here today.

36:01.117 --> 36:03.451
How important are these
cons, like BronyCon

36:03.452 --> 36:05.704
and the other ones that are
emerging for the Brony culture?

36:05.705 --> 36:07.372
I think they're very important.

36:07.373 --> 36:09.958
They serve multiple functions
in the Brony community.

36:09.959 --> 36:13.043
For one thing, they provide
an opportunity for people

36:13.069 --> 36:16.756
who might not ordinarily be able
to socialize with other Bronies

36:16.757 --> 36:20.343
to do so in a non threatening environment,
where nobody's gonna look at you funny

36:20.344 --> 36:23.998
if you're wearing a Fluttershy shirt,
and you're a 35 year old guy with a beard.

36:24.098 --> 36:25.974
And that's really important.

36:25.975 --> 36:29.644
A lot of people need to be able to
express their enjoyment of the show

36:29.645 --> 36:32.343
in a non judgmental environment.

36:32.523 --> 36:36.985
There's more to it than just ponies, and
people think it's ponies and all for girls,

36:36.986 --> 36:37.986
but it's really not.

36:37.987 --> 36:40.113
It's about friendship
and having a good time,

36:40.114 --> 36:42.608
and it's pretty much what
everybody's doing now here.

36:42.908 --> 36:47.162
I really love the characters because
they're relatable to everyone,

36:47.163 --> 36:51.333
and they have some depth so it's
not like they're just stereotypes.

at you, and just walked away.

37:17.651 --> 37:22.655
but I also don't feel like it's like where
most minorities kind of feel suppressed,

us, but it's not a bad thing.

That was part of the reason why
I started BronyCon, I realized,

38:28.264 --> 38:31.391
this is a community that
deserves a real world presence,

38:31.392 --> 38:36.688
it deserves what the Star Trek fans and
the Sci-Fi people, and the Anime fans have.

38:36.689 --> 38:40.593

scene, and now it has one.

This is incredible.

38:49.618 --> 38:53.413

and I'm hanging
out with them today.

It's very exciting and really really cool
that my dad is okay with this kind of thing,

cause My Little Pony is like, there's nothing
violent about it, there's nothing wrong with it,

39:15.269 --> 39:19.765
it's a cartoon that people
enjoy for good reason.

"Yeah, I'll go,"and
I said, "Okay, fine."

she didn't wanna do that trip,

a young man named Lyle

who said that his father
was very conservative,

40:05.236 --> 40:08.238
and he was concerned about
coming to the convention.

to meet his father.

- A little bit.
- Yeah. [LAUGHS]

40:18.749 --> 40:21.000
So, should we go in
and start taking a look?

40:21.001 --> 40:23.586
Because we're gonna see this
sort of through your eyes,

40:23.587 --> 40:26.740

all, all of our eyes, okay?

40:26.799 --> 40:31.761
Uh-oh. [LAUGHING]

I decided that maybe we could
have a surprise for Lyle's father

40:35.099 --> 40:40.019
and that was that he could meet another father,
a father of a young man who was also a Brony,

40:40.020 --> 40:45.108
and this father actually did know all about
BronyCon and wanted to bring his son to it.

40:45.109 --> 40:49.195
And we thought it would be very interesting to
have these two fathers get together and talk.

- Gilpatrick.

about coming here?

You know, it's pretty much a little
girls' thing and I was like, "What?"

41:07.881 --> 41:13.386
But you know my son, uh, he said, "You know
Dad, you know, before you think about this,"

41:13.387 --> 41:16.306
"you know, let me explain why,"
so he explained it to me, and I,

41:16.307 --> 41:18.391
he actually got me
to look at some stuff.

41:18.392 --> 41:22.020
My son has always never been
one who follows the, the crowd.

41:22.021 --> 41:25.189
You know, that's one thing that I always
like about him, he's an individual,

41:25.190 --> 41:29.193
which is sometimes hard for him,
um, and I know is hard for Bronies,

41:29.194 --> 41:32.905
that they get picked on
at school just all around,

41:32.906 --> 41:35.700
a lot of em don't like to tell people
that they're Bronies because of that,

41:35.701 --> 41:37.327
especially when they're younger.

41:37.328 --> 41:41.483
My son still has concerns about
what other people may think,

41:41.915 --> 41:47.003
so I expect he's not gonna be buying a
pink hooded sweatshirt at this convention.

41:47.004 --> 41:50.465
My son has friends that he's a
little hesitant to even tell them,

41:50.466 --> 41:53.961
he has other friends he's got a
number of friends that are Bronies too.

41:54.303 --> 41:58.598
The fact that my son came to me
and he confided in me and felt that
he was comfortable to say that,

41:58.599 --> 41:59.724
I think that's a good thing.

41:59.725 --> 42:03.436
And I think that you should take that as a
good thing that your son has a relationship

42:03.437 --> 42:06.814
where he, you know, he took a
chance and discussed it with you,

42:06.815 --> 42:08.358
or you found out, one or the other.

42:08.359 --> 42:10.735
Um, I found out through my wife,

42:10.736 --> 42:15.016
my son was hesitant to
mention it to me himself.

42:15.741 --> 42:20.411
I have great sympathy for Lyle's
father because his 16 year old boy

42:20.412 --> 42:22.872
wants to watch a
cartoon for little girls.

42:22.873 --> 42:25.708
I also understand the fact that
he was willing to go with his son,

42:25.709 --> 42:28.532
which I thought was really
quite wonderful on his part.

42:28.545 --> 42:34.372
And to walk into a world which was very
different than the world that he is used to.

42:34.551 --> 42:36.803
They don't understand
how lucky they are.

42:36.804 --> 42:40.223
My son isn't able to talk,
he isn't able to walk,

42:40.224 --> 42:45.019
he isn't able to do any of the things
that I expected him to be able to do.

42:45.020 --> 42:48.564
If he was a Brony, I would
think that was amazing because

42:48.565 --> 42:53.277
he would be a sweet, understanding,
compassionate boy that got that

42:53.278 --> 42:58.449
watching girl characters do
awesome things is just as awesome as

42:58.450 --> 43:00.993
watching boy characters
do awesome things.

43:00.994 --> 43:07.250
To people who feel that, you know, an adult man
watching a show that's meant for little girls,

43:07.251 --> 43:10.503
that they think that that's wrong or
that's strange, I think I would say this.

43:10.504 --> 43:14.799
I would ask them, "Why do
you think that's strange?"

43:14.800 --> 43:18.094
And, "What about that
makes you uncomfortable?"

43:18.095 --> 43:23.933
As a society I think our first reaction
is to jump to the conclusion that
there's something wrong with than

43:23.934 --> 43:26.352
but I think that that's
what's needs to be changed.

43:26.353 --> 43:31.315
We need to allow men to be
gentle and to be sensitive,

43:31.316 --> 43:35.516
and to care about one another
and not call them weak for caring.

43:36.029 --> 43:39.198
At BronyCon there was a lunch just
for people who were in the military

43:39.199 --> 43:42.773
and it was really amazing, because
close to sixty people showed up.

43:43.328 --> 43:46.197
Coming here and seeing so
many other military Bronies,

43:46.290 --> 43:49.534
has just been really
uplifting, because

43:49.752 --> 43:53.212
as a Brony, I just really
felt isolated, you know,

43:53.213 --> 43:56.742
like I was the only one in the
military and that it was so hard

43:56.800 --> 44:00.178
to be so excited about something I loved
so much and not being able to tell anyone.

44:00.179 --> 44:04.182
"I'm going to a BronyCon," you know, I wanted
to tell everyone, I want to tell my friends,

44:04.183 --> 44:07.685
and my family, but my friends
are all in the military,

44:07.686 --> 44:11.189
and it's like, oh, I can't
tell them because, you know.

44:11.190 --> 44:12.106
Because why?

44:12.107 --> 44:17.820
'Cause of the way that the
military in general, would react.

44:17.821 --> 44:22.116
It's like, "Oh, you like a little girls'
show, oh, well you must be you know,"

44:22.117 --> 44:25.036
"feminine, and or gay, or
whatever," and it's like, you know,

44:25.037 --> 44:26.788
I want to just sit down
and say, no, you know,

44:26.789 --> 44:31.793
watch the show, watch the animation,
and, and appreciate it for what it is,

44:31.794 --> 44:34.337
and get past that, cause
I mean, are you so afraid,

44:34.338 --> 44:36.506
of exposing yourself
to something feminine,

44:36.507 --> 44:38.049
that you're gonna
suddenly turn gay,

44:38.050 --> 44:40.218
you're gonna "catch the
gay" by watching the show?

44:40.219 --> 44:42.094
The Elements of Harmony, you know,

44:42.095 --> 44:44.347

44:44.348 --> 44:47.183
Magic, uh, Laughter and Honesty,

44:47.184 --> 44:49.894
coincide with some of
the Army values of uh,

44:49.895 --> 44:54.596
loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service,
honor, integrity and personal courage.

44:54.733 --> 44:57.944
I was so excited to meet all these
Bronies who serve in the military.

44:57.945 --> 45:01.599
I surprised them, and I brought
them autographed slap bracelets.

45:01.782 --> 45:02.990
Who wants to be slapped?

45:02.991 --> 45:04.283
- I do!
- Hai-yah! [SLAP]

45:04.284 --> 45:08.120
- Yes.
- Yah! Yah! Yah!

45:08.121 --> 45:12.617
One of the things that I think was
really important for them to find
out was that they were not alone.

45:12.626 --> 45:14.961

everything that you do,

[MUSIC STARTING]

45:31.270 --> 45:34.146
Though the growth in pony
fandom might simply seem absurd,

45:34.147 --> 45:37.108
True fans adore the show while
others gallop to the herd!

45:37.109 --> 45:40.194
For hipster Bronies watching
pastel ponies has appeal,

45:40.195 --> 45:43.072
though first it seems ironic,
soon enough it's very real!

45:43.073 --> 45:45.992
For moderates the start was
humble, finding it through hype,

45:45.993 --> 45:48.995
when the Bronies did invade their
favorite forums and websites.

45:48.996 --> 45:52.164
And though first a little
skeptical these moderates inquired,

45:52.165 --> 45:55.334
and once they finally saw the
show their love for it caught fire!

45:55.335 --> 45:58.004
The core of the meet-ups
and conventions that you see,

45:58.005 --> 46:00.798
Are the social groups that
come to BronyCon and Everfree.

46:00.799 --> 46:03.676
Yes the moderates and hipsters
are the big groups of the Bronies,

46:03.677 --> 46:07.096
They're the dudes that are the bulk
of all the men who like the ponies.

46:07.097 --> 46:09.420
[MUSIC ENDING]

46:10.934 --> 46:14.312
What we did is we defined
Brony fan behaviors,

46:14.313 --> 46:17.481
and we also looked at the
different types of Bronies.

46:17.482 --> 46:20.109
One of the things we
wanted to really do was to

46:20.110 --> 46:23.779
look at some of the myths
that people had about Bronies.

46:23.780 --> 46:26.032
A lot of those stereotypes
would say, you know,

46:26.033 --> 46:28.701
"They're 30 year old,
unemployed males who

46:28.702 --> 46:31.537
live in their parents' basements
and watch cartoons all day."

46:31.538 --> 46:37.793
This was not the case, that in fact they are
highly educated, group of heterosexual males.

46:37.794 --> 46:43.007
I'm a biologist, uh, I work at uh,
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

46:43.008 --> 46:45.217
The average age is around 20.

46:45.218 --> 46:48.763
In the stressful environment that
is college, it's a fun escape for me.

46:48.764 --> 46:52.099
The Bronies tend to be
open to new experiences,

46:52.100 --> 46:55.102
but they also tend to
be more introverted.

46:55.103 --> 46:59.774
I'm a Brony because the fandom creates
a sense of security and acceptance

46:59.775 --> 47:02.568
in an uncertain and
troublesome world.

47:02.569 --> 47:05.363
There are a group of Bronies
who are more extroverted,

47:05.364 --> 47:07.907
and we call those
the Social Bronies.

47:07.908 --> 47:12.279
I sometimes have taken to call
them our Evangelical Bronies,

47:12.329 --> 47:16.958
because these are the Bronies who are out
there, trying to uh, increase the herd.

47:16.959 --> 47:20.294
I'm a Brony because this
fandom is freaking incredible.

47:20.295 --> 47:22.004
We're Bronies!

47:22.005 --> 47:26.092
Because it's a show about colorful ponies
in a magical land of sunshine and rainbows.

47:26.093 --> 47:27.551
And awesome.

47:27.552 --> 47:30.012
The show breeds genuineness.

47:30.013 --> 47:33.349
When I realized they weren't being
sarcastic or ironic, it was amazing!

47:33.350 --> 47:35.810
And that has actually
really impacted me.

47:35.811 --> 47:40.648
And the fans, now it's, now
it kind of belongs to them now,

47:40.649 --> 47:43.109
and they're, they're
making this movement,

47:43.110 --> 47:45.736
and I think it's refreshing.

47:45.737 --> 47:48.823
I have watched all the
episodes of My Little Pony,

47:48.824 --> 47:51.951
in part, because when I'm
interacting with the Bronies,

47:51.952 --> 47:56.949
I like to know what they mean
by terms like uh, "20% cooler".

47:57.290 --> 47:58.708
Do you not like the color?

47:58.709 --> 48:01.210
The color's fine, just
make it look cooler.

48:01.211 --> 48:02.503
Do you not like the shape?

48:02.504 --> 48:06.298
The shape's fine, just make the
whole thing, you know, cooler.

48:06.299 --> 48:08.634
It needs to be about 20% cooler.

48:08.635 --> 48:12.847
We are post 9/11, with uh,

48:12.848 --> 48:16.969
worrying about terrorism,
worrying about aggression,

48:17.019 --> 48:21.313
and in a lot of respects, I believe
that this is a flight from that.

48:21.314 --> 48:25.526
That it's a retreat to
something which is happier,

48:25.527 --> 48:28.446
which stresses getting
along with others,

48:28.447 --> 48:34.618
and is an escape from the worries
that these young people are facing.

48:34.619 --> 48:40.332
My Little Pony Friendship is Magic is sort
of letting them know that they're not alone.

48:40.333 --> 48:42.835
One of the other things
that we did look at,

48:42.836 --> 48:45.838
was what was the
function of being a Brony.

48:45.839 --> 48:48.049
The first one was
a social function.

48:48.050 --> 48:52.011
The second function, and the
one which surprised us the most,

48:52.012 --> 48:55.632
is that it's also served
a guidance function.

48:55.640 --> 48:58.684
Because cartoons
are little parables,

48:58.685 --> 49:03.230
and we have begun to
call this the WWPD factor:

49:03.231 --> 49:04.982
What Would a Pony Do?

49:04.983 --> 49:09.138
It's a show that has
actually created a community.

49:09.279 --> 49:11.989
I think it's a visceral
thing that's happening here,

49:11.990 --> 49:14.450
I think it's
connected to the heart,

49:14.451 --> 49:16.945
and I think the show
is a show of excellence.

49:17.245 --> 49:20.273
I think I made up stories
right out of the gate.

49:20.290 --> 49:22.416
With, when I got
my first pony toys.

49:22.417 --> 49:24.752
Um, it was just the way I played,

49:24.753 --> 49:28.339
and I actually think that
the way I played with ponies,

49:28.340 --> 49:30.257
with Strawberry Shortcake,
with my stuffed animals,

49:30.258 --> 49:35.137
I look back now and I know that that's
kind of where my creative mind started,

49:35.138 --> 49:38.182
and what lead me to writing
stories for a living.

49:38.183 --> 49:40.935
There's something about
the color combinations,

49:40.936 --> 49:43.479
the picture on their
butt, their cutie mark,

49:43.480 --> 49:48.359
that just made my brain automatically
start putting those puzzle pieces together

49:48.360 --> 49:50.152
and creating
personalities for them.

49:50.153 --> 49:51.821
And then once I had my cast,

49:51.822 --> 49:57.076
I would put them in different areas
of my room, so like my dresser drawer

49:57.077 --> 50:00.788
I would put the castle up on top of that
and that was the castle up on the mountain,

50:00.789 --> 50:03.791
and I'd put the cloud
somewhere on my bed,

50:03.792 --> 50:07.086
and the whole bed was just like the
expanse of where the Pegasus lived,

50:07.087 --> 50:12.049
and my whole room would become
the world that they lived in,

50:12.050 --> 50:16.637
and the stuffed animals I played with would
be the creatures that they encountered,

50:16.638 --> 50:21.392
and I'd make up these adventure
stories for them to go on.

53:25.327 --> 53:27.119
you know try and look like
they're just right from the show,

53:27.120 --> 53:29.079
and he does a little more stylized.

53:29.080 --> 53:33.751
I decided to come to BronyCon because
Lauren Faust is going to be here.

53:33.752 --> 53:36.045
If it weren't for her,
I wouldn't be here.

53:36.046 --> 53:37.629
I have to thank her so much.

53:37.630 --> 53:41.300
He takes the characters from
the show, a fan asks a question,

53:41.301 --> 53:44.345
and he draws the response
that character would make.

53:44.346 --> 53:48.751
When I draw, and I see the smile
on their faces, I'm so happy.

53:49.893 --> 53:53.812
The Brony community is very into,
like, making their own content.

53:53.813 --> 53:57.691
It means a lot to them to be able
to become a part of the community

53:57.692 --> 53:59.234
and expand the community more.

53:59.235 --> 54:02.404
And so one of the things
that had started happening was

54:02.405 --> 54:03.947
they started making
their own games,

54:03.948 --> 54:06.316
and they started making
their own animations.

54:07.702 --> 54:11.455
It's kind of brought out a creative side
that I haven't used in almost 20 years.

54:11.456 --> 54:15.250
So, when I was growing up there was
a lot of creative, creative outlets,

54:15.251 --> 54:18.212
that I would have, like with my
singing, and the playing of the clarinet,

54:18.213 --> 54:21.090
and marching band, and then
my family moved to Texas,

54:21.091 --> 54:24.051
and I joined the military,
and that all went away.

54:24.052 --> 54:29.629
And so, here, after you know, 16, 17 years,
here I am, I'm practicing my singing again,

54:29.641 --> 54:33.352
I'm helping animators with artistic
projects, I'm writing a story,

54:33.353 --> 54:36.472
and I've kind of surprised myself
with it to be absolutely honest.

54:37.190 --> 54:39.024
BronyCon means to me,

54:39.025 --> 54:42.361
a place where people can go
and be tolerated and accepted,

54:42.362 --> 54:46.532
it doesn't matter your age,
your gender, anything about you,

54:46.533 --> 54:48.992
no matter who you are, you
can find a place in this fandom

54:48.993 --> 54:51.286
and you can be accepted and
I think that's really cool,

54:51.287 --> 54:54.110
because a lot of other
fandoms are restrictive.

55:30.410 --> 55:32.453
We're cosplaying, as uh,

55:32.454 --> 55:34.830

55:34.831 --> 55:37.082
Everything is fine,
Mr. and Mrs. Cake.

55:37.083 --> 55:38.417
I really like dressing up,

55:38.418 --> 55:40.794

with the sewing machine,

55:40.795 --> 55:44.244

so it was really easy to do it.

know a bit more.

were gonna think it was lame, no matter what,

talk about why we're
all friends that like

these lessons to heart,

of their community

01:04:01.754 --> 01:04:03.588
to be "Love and Tolerate".

we have in the show, they're,

their lives and their world,

amazing thing they've done,

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:15.934
and I think the, the biggest
thing that they've done

01:04:15.935 --> 01:04:20.090
in the name of this, like, "Love and Tolerate"
and spreading the magic of friendship,

01:04:20.398 --> 01:04:23.441
is the amount of money that they've
been able to raise for good causes.

01:04:23.442 --> 01:04:24.889

Here's a Brohoof just for you.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.652
Hi guys!

01:05:19.665 --> 01:05:25.447
Today we are gonna go visit Grayson,
and I'm surprising him with a giant pony.

01:05:25.588 --> 01:05:28.256
Just goes to show you how
generous this community is,

01:05:28.257 --> 01:05:32.135
I put on my Twitter that proceeds from
these little hats we made will go to him,

01:05:32.136 --> 01:05:36.014
which we sold 500 dollars worth of
hats so I gotta give his mom that check,

01:05:36.015 --> 01:05:39.350
and then there's a $6000 dollar
check, just from donations online.

01:05:39.351 --> 01:05:42.228
This is one of the
things that they made me.

01:05:42.229 --> 01:05:43.146
Awww.

01:05:43.147 --> 01:05:47.442
People who don't like, or hate Bronies,
have no idea what the group is about.

01:05:47.443 --> 01:05:50.361
They look outside of themselves,

01:05:50.362 --> 01:05:52.642
and they're doing good
things for other people.

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:55.526
- You're Twilight Sparkle.
- Okay good. [LAUGHS]

01:05:56.994 --> 01:05:59.079
This poster has been in my
possession since December,

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:02.957
and I had decided a while
ago that at or after BronyCon

01:06:02.958 --> 01:06:06.237
I was going to contribute it
somehow to some charitable cause.

01:06:06.545 --> 01:06:11.007
So, I'm sad to see it go,
but I'm happy to see it go

01:06:11.008 --> 01:06:13.768
because I know that it's going
to go to a really good cause.

01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:19.516
Charity is part of the show in that we all help
each other without expecting anything in return,

01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:23.888
and at every convention, there's always a
big auction to raise funds for a worthy cause.

01:06:26.774 --> 01:06:28.847

01:06:59.014 --> 01:07:01.337
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:01.934 --> 01:07:03.476
The message is really good,

01:07:03.477 --> 01:07:06.646
because it's aimed at sort of a
fundamental thing about human behavior,

01:07:06.647 --> 01:07:08.231
which is just, be a good friend.

01:07:08.232 --> 01:07:10.066
Which is something you're
trying to teach your children

01:07:10.067 --> 01:07:12.193
when they're at the age that
that demographic is about

01:07:12.194 --> 01:07:15.029
There's something really attractive
about getting that message again.

01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:19.784
It is a time in society when people
are breaking from stereotypes,

01:07:19.785 --> 01:07:22.287
and treasuring their individuality.

01:07:22.288 --> 01:07:27.041
Today's world of utter chaos needs actual
messages of integrity and harmony, and

01:07:27.042 --> 01:07:29.069
it doesn't. Have. To suck.

01:07:32.798 --> 01:07:36.301
When I was invited to
BronyCon, um, you know,

01:07:36.302 --> 01:07:39.376
I had a lot of mixed feelings
'cause I had already left the show.

but I don't regret the
decision to leave; I had to.

see it continue without me.

if you could sign my DVD.
- Of course I can!

- [CROWD] Yeah! [CHEERING]

Well, I feel like this whole
um, this whole event has

01:16:20.075 --> 01:16:23.869
helped me to maybe approach people who
I wouldn't normally or wouldn't know,

01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:27.498
and um, yeah, I could do it a
lot more easier I think because

01:16:27.499 --> 01:16:31.794
this is, I have done it so
much in the past two days,

01:16:31.795 --> 01:16:34.243
so I feel like I could
do it a lot easier.

01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:38.118
So, if I happen to
get lost... again...

01:16:38.135 --> 01:16:41.053
I feel like it would be a lot easier
to approach someone for directions,

01:16:41.054 --> 01:16:44.223
rather than spinning around in
a circle for fifteen minutes.

try to piece it together.

Yeah!

01:17:05.036 --> 01:17:09.957
I believe this movement is something that
can be more than what it currently is,

01:17:09.958 --> 01:17:12.293
and I think it's going to
turn into something like than

01:17:12.294 --> 01:17:16.297
it is a way of dealing
with human interaction.

01:17:16.298 --> 01:17:19.759

know these core values,

be kind, courteous,

something you don't see these days.

It may have been
intended for little girls,

01:17:26.433 --> 01:17:28.551
but it ended up transcending that.

01:17:28.769 --> 01:17:32.969
I wouldn't be surprised if
My Little Pony has a hand

01:17:33.064 --> 01:17:34.815
in changing how people see things.

01:17:34.816 --> 01:17:40.097
I think it makes these little tweaks on
people to sort of go, "Oh, okay." [LAUGH]

01:17:40.197 --> 01:17:44.492
A lot of people find
something healing in it, that,

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:47.036
that makes the world
brighter, and makes you go,

01:17:47.037 --> 01:17:48.746
"Okay, it's not so bad."

01:17:48.747 --> 01:17:53.959
Bronies are not just fans that are
interested in watching a cartoon.

01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:55.085
Ponies!

01:17:55.086 --> 01:17:57.797
What makes them special
is they're willing to take

01:17:57.798 --> 01:18:03.170
the lessons from this show, and they're
lessons that were intended for children,

01:18:03.303 --> 01:18:09.433
and turn them into adult lessons,
and they're still the same lessons
that we need to be applying as adults.

01:18:09.434 --> 01:18:13.813
And that we're really talking about being
nice and kind and generous, and loyal,

01:18:13.814 --> 01:18:18.567
and we don't have many things in
our society right now that does that.

01:18:18.568 --> 01:18:23.113
My Little Pony might be
opening some people's minds

01:18:23.114 --> 01:18:27.326
about what is acceptable
in behavior for men,

01:18:27.327 --> 01:18:28.953
and what it means to be a man,

01:18:28.954 --> 01:18:34.667
and whether or not being sensitive and
being caring is part of being a man.

01:18:34.668 --> 01:18:39.839
Maybe those are like little seeds that are
being planted into the world and into society

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:44.837
that in years to come, might,
might make a difference somewhere.

01:18:45.262 --> 01:18:47.335
