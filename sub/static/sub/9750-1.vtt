00:48.433 --> 00:49.991
Like, wait for me.

00:54.372 --> 00:56.704
<i>Thanks. lt won't happen again.</i>

01:00.712 --> 01:02.441
Hey, you mind if l--?

01:03.214 --> 01:04.875
Got it.

01:06.050 --> 01:07.347
Ah!

01:11.556 --> 01:14.184
Have a nice trip, Shaggy?

01:14.359 --> 01:17.226
Hey, yep, sure did. Just like yesterday...

01:17.395 --> 01:20.762
...and the day before that,
and the day before that.

01:22.433 --> 01:23.457
Grow up, man.

01:26.704 --> 01:27.796
Hey, watch out!

01:28.406 --> 01:29.737
Sorry.

01:32.310 --> 01:34.073
Be careful.

01:34.312 --> 01:36.974
What do you got there?
Trying to build a better mousetrap?

01:37.148 --> 01:40.982
This is the prototype of a ethanol-based,
self-circulating nanoreactor.

01:41.152 --> 01:43.620
lt filters negative energy
through a quantum matrix...

01:43.788 --> 01:46.188
...by compressing relative density
of atomic matter.

01:46.357 --> 01:49.815
Which l know sounds highly unstable
unless you invert the zirconium....

01:50.361 --> 01:51.692
''That which we call a rose...

01:51.863 --> 01:53.854
...by any other name
would smell as sweet...

01:54.032 --> 01:55.056
...without that title.

01:55.233 --> 01:56.564
Romeo, doff thy name...

01:56.734 --> 01:59.567
-...and for that--''
-Excuseth me.

01:59.737 --> 02:02.900
Do you just mind if l just get in there?

02:03.074 --> 02:05.872
-Oh, sure. Just let me move my bag.
-Okay, perfect. Thanks.

02:06.044 --> 02:08.705
<i>All right, l'm just gonna--
l'm just gonna get in here.</i>

02:08.880 --> 02:12.111
<i>Just move my bag, all will be fine.
-l know what l'm doing.</i>

02:12.283 --> 02:14.444
<i>Really? Because l don't think
you do know.</i>

02:14.952 --> 02:16.544
Made it.

02:17.622 --> 02:21.058
<i>''What's in a name?
What's in a name? What's--?''</i>

02:23.528 --> 02:25.155
Care for a bite?

02:25.329 --> 02:26.728
What is that?

02:26.898 --> 02:28.490
<i>lt's a PBJ and S.</i>

02:28.666 --> 02:31.829
-Peanut butter, jelly and sardines.
-Oh, oh, okay.

02:32.003 --> 02:34.267
-l can scrape off the jelly.
-No, thanks.

02:34.439 --> 02:36.031
They scoffed Oppenheimer too.

02:36.207 --> 02:38.801
l realized the kinetic instability
could be addressed...

02:38.976 --> 02:41.809
...by reversing the polarity
of the cadmium core--

02:41.979 --> 02:46.848
Voila, l knew everyone at the science fair
would bow before me.

02:47.018 --> 02:49.384
Oh. Hello.

02:49.554 --> 02:53.547
This is the prototype of an ethanol-based,
self-circulating nanoreactor.

02:53.725 --> 02:57.718
lt filters negative energy through a quantum
matrix by compressing relative density.

03:10.341 --> 03:12.400
<i>-Come on, it's just Shaggy.
-Every day.</i>

03:14.145 --> 03:16.807
All right, have a good one, Velma.

03:19.283 --> 03:20.341
Ah!

03:20.518 --> 03:23.885
<i>-lt's just so easy.
-Just go.</i>

03:24.655 --> 03:29.092
<i>Arriba, arriba, the Spanish club
will be hosting a fiesta lunch next Tuesday.</i>

03:29.260 --> 03:30.284
Come on.

03:34.198 --> 03:36.291
Must be the humidity.

03:36.467 --> 03:39.493
Oh, my God.
Not interested?

03:44.041 --> 03:45.770
l hate this job.

03:47.111 --> 03:49.602
l never wanted to be a janitor.

03:51.682 --> 03:53.149
Excuse me.

03:53.317 --> 03:56.809
Coming through. Help me.

03:59.490 --> 04:01.958
Locker problems again, Mr. Rogers?

04:02.126 --> 04:07.393
Yeah, l....
l seem to get the squirrelly one every year.

04:08.199 --> 04:13.068
l like to think l am pretty plugged in
to the scene here at the ''C.H.''

04:13.237 --> 04:14.795
<i>And if we're keeping it real...</i>

04:15.239 --> 04:17.969
<i>...l can't help but notice
that you've had a hard time...</i>

04:18.142 --> 04:22.340
...finding a crew of homebuds
to ''kick it'' with.

04:24.182 --> 04:25.410
Say what now?

04:25.983 --> 04:29.646
Friends, Mr. Rogers. Do you have any?

04:30.288 --> 04:33.416
Friends? Yeah.
Like, l got tons of those, you know.

04:33.591 --> 04:36.025
Just lots.
They are always inviting me to this--

04:36.194 --> 04:38.185
<i>We're going to the park...</i>

04:38.362 --> 04:41.593
...and throwing and--
Hey, is that a new bow tie?

04:42.200 --> 04:43.428
Right.

04:43.601 --> 04:46.661
Now, believe it or not,
when l was your age...

04:46.838 --> 04:49.238
...l had a hard time
making connections with people.

04:49.807 --> 04:51.206
No.

04:51.375 --> 04:52.740
But you know what helped me?

04:52.910 --> 04:53.934
Philately.

04:54.111 --> 04:55.976
-Bless you.
-No, philately.

04:56.147 --> 04:58.775
<i>Stamp collecting.
Oh, l know what you're thinking.</i>

04:58.950 --> 05:00.542
Dweeb city, huh?

05:00.718 --> 05:04.245
But l have to tell you,
it is more like thrill city.

05:04.422 --> 05:08.256
<i>l'm particularly excited
about my latest find.</i>

05:08.659 --> 05:11.127
One-eyed Jack. Here.

05:13.531 --> 05:18.400
<i>Now, if you'll look closely, you'll notice
that the jackrabbit has only one eye.</i>

05:18.569 --> 05:22.733
<i>lt's a misprint.
Those are the most valuable.</i>

05:22.907 --> 05:25.068
Would you look at that?

05:27.945 --> 05:30.413
So, Norville...

05:30.581 --> 05:34.073
<i>...l guess what l'm trying to say
is don't give up.</i>

05:34.252 --> 05:37.016
<i>You'll find people you fit in with.</i>

05:37.188 --> 05:39.281
They may not know it themselves...

05:39.457 --> 05:43.325
<i>...but they're out there,
waiting to fit in with you too.</i>

05:43.494 --> 05:45.928
And until that day....

05:48.532 --> 05:50.830
<i>''Philately is Phun ''?</i>

05:54.672 --> 05:56.264
Thanks.

05:57.909 --> 06:00.241
Hey, hey. Right here, dog.

06:01.679 --> 06:03.010
Yeah.

06:03.180 --> 06:06.411
-That is what l am talking about.
-See you.

06:07.084 --> 06:08.745
Okay.

06:16.294 --> 06:18.728
<i>Welcome to the
Pet Adoption Fair. Open your hearts...</i>

06:18.896 --> 06:21.626
<i>...to an adorable puppy,
kitten or adult pet.</i>

06:21.799 --> 06:24.267
<i>They don't get any cuter
than these little guys.</i>

06:27.872 --> 06:29.567
Banjo here has a lot of personality.

06:29.740 --> 06:32.300
<i>l think we're looking for something
a little bit bigger.</i>

06:32.476 --> 06:35.309
Well, l think l know just the dog for you.

06:35.947 --> 06:36.971
Here he is.

06:37.448 --> 06:40.940
<i>Meet our pet of the day.
He's very affectionate.</i>

06:41.118 --> 06:42.881
<i>He'd bring a lot of joy to any family.</i>

06:43.054 --> 06:46.251
Are you kidding? Looks like
it would eat us out of house and home.

06:46.424 --> 06:48.324
No, no, no.

06:48.793 --> 06:50.260
No.

06:54.632 --> 06:56.691
<i>Don't worry, Scoobert, l have a feeling...</i>

06:56.867 --> 07:00.200
<i>...that you're finally
gonna get adopted today. l just know it.</i>

07:06.844 --> 07:07.868
Hello.

07:10.781 --> 07:13.477
Hello. Hello. Hello.

07:16.954 --> 07:18.080
Hey.

07:35.973 --> 07:38.669
That one. l want that one, Daddy.

07:38.843 --> 07:42.677
This is the last time l tell you
you can get anything you want.

07:44.882 --> 07:46.076
Hiya, boy.

07:46.984 --> 07:48.576
<i>Hi, we'll take this one.</i>

07:48.753 --> 07:51.085
-That, one? Really?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:51.255 --> 07:54.486
<i>Oh, gosh, you know,
we're gonna be really sorry to see him go.</i>

07:54.658 --> 07:55.716
<i>l'll get the paperwork.</i>

07:56.727 --> 07:58.957
Well, fella, you ready to meet
your new family?

07:59.130 --> 08:00.358
Yeah.

08:02.867 --> 08:05.392
-No, no, no!
Daddy! Ah!

08:06.737 --> 08:09.604
-Scoobert, no!
-Daddy! Help!

08:09.774 --> 08:12.140
-Someone, hey!
-Get him off me!

08:12.309 --> 08:15.278
<i>This crazy mutt's out of control!</i>

08:16.814 --> 08:17.838
<i>Thank you all...</i>

08:18.015 --> 08:22.475
<i>...for making this our most successful
pet adoption fair ever.</i>

08:23.587 --> 08:26.920
Next month for sure, Scoobert.
l just know it.

08:28.526 --> 08:30.221
<i>You're good.</i>

08:51.015 --> 08:54.143
Hey. Hey. Hey, wait for me.

08:54.752 --> 08:59.314
Hey. Wait for-- Wait for me.

09:16.040 --> 09:18.668
<i>Philately is Phun?</i>

09:19.176 --> 09:20.302
Phooey.

10:24.909 --> 10:30.074
Come, Prudence.
We must serve our new master.

11:04.615 --> 11:07.516
<i>What's the matter, boy?
ls something out there got you spooked?</i>

11:07.685 --> 11:09.983
Ghosts. Ghosts.

11:10.154 --> 11:13.419
<i>A ''roast''? Like, what's so scary
about a delicious roast?</i>

11:13.591 --> 11:15.616
Not ''roast,'' ghosts.

11:16.493 --> 11:19.326
<i>lt's okay, boy. You're safe here with me.</i>

11:20.431 --> 11:23.764
<i>M name's Norville.
But most people call me Shaggy.</i>

11:23.934 --> 11:26.835
<i>-Shaggy.
-Let's see what your name is.</i>

11:27.571 --> 11:29.630
Scoobert Doo.

11:30.107 --> 11:32.405
Like, l wonder if people call you Scooby.

11:32.576 --> 11:34.942
<i>Kind of has a nice ring to it,
don't you think?</i>

11:35.112 --> 11:38.445
<i>-Yeah.
-Then it's nice to meet you, Scooby-Doo.</i>

11:38.616 --> 11:41.050
Nice to meet you, Shaggy.

11:42.753 --> 11:45.517
<i>l don't see anything else on your tags.</i>

11:45.689 --> 11:48.249
<i>Who's your owner?
Where do you belong, boy?</i>

11:48.425 --> 11:50.290
Nowhere.

11:52.329 --> 11:55.355
<i>-Well, you're welcome to stay here with me.
-Really?</i>

11:55.532 --> 11:57.625
We can be friends.
How does that sound?

11:59.003 --> 12:00.129
Okay.

12:00.304 --> 12:02.704
Scoob. Scooby, buddy, okay.

12:02.873 --> 12:06.036
<i>We'll be friends. We'll be friends.
Okay. Okay.</i>

12:26.363 --> 12:29.355
<i>Oh, yeah. Who's a good Shaggy?</i>

12:57.161 --> 12:58.628
Hello.

13:00.931 --> 13:02.193
Nice bus.

13:05.336 --> 13:08.863
<i>l told you this would work.
People barely even know that l'm--</i>

13:09.039 --> 13:10.199
Ah!

13:11.709 --> 13:12.869
Neanderthals.

13:13.043 --> 13:15.807
-What are you, 5?
-What are you, the fun police?

13:17.247 --> 13:21.149
Calm down, boy.
Happens all the time. Come on.

13:21.952 --> 13:23.749
Lousy son of a....

13:23.921 --> 13:27.015
<i>l know we didn't have time
for breakfast...</i>

13:27.191 --> 13:29.250
...so wanna go halfsies?

13:29.426 --> 13:30.893
Scooby?

13:34.365 --> 13:36.959
<i>l just don't get what's so fun
about doing that to somebody?</i>

13:37.134 --> 13:38.692
<i>Dude, if you don't know-- Ow!</i>

13:39.703 --> 13:42.263
Hey, you,
what are you doing down there, huh?

13:42.439 --> 13:44.031
<i>-Scooby, don't!
That's enough!</i>

13:45.142 --> 13:46.803
-Bullying peo--
What?

13:46.977 --> 13:50.242
<i>My science project.
-Buddy, you're gonna get it.</i>

13:50.414 --> 13:51.745
<i>Hey, that's my dog.</i>

13:51.915 --> 13:53.576
All right, stop.
Buddy-- Hey!

13:55.319 --> 13:56.946
<i>l said l'm-- Ow! Ow!</i>

14:02.493 --> 14:06.987
Hey, yo, V.P. Grimes got himself a new car.

14:09.032 --> 14:11.296
Oh, yeah.

14:13.837 --> 14:16.032
<i>There's metal in the purse. Ow! Ow!</i>

14:16.807 --> 14:20.834
Hey! Hey, you kids.
Knock it off back there.

14:35.192 --> 14:37.752
My new car.

14:46.537 --> 14:49.631
Who is responsible for this?

14:56.113 --> 14:59.571
Six weeks of detention?
But Vice Principal Grimes...

14:59.750 --> 15:02.878
-...l was merely a victim of circumstance.
-As was l.

15:03.053 --> 15:06.045
-And l was only trying to help.
-Oh, save it.

15:06.490 --> 15:10.984
<i>Consider yourselves lucky
l'm not suing your parents for damages.</i>

15:11.462 --> 15:15.057
Hey, l was just wondering,
are snacks provided for us here...

15:15.232 --> 15:17.291
...or do we have to bring our own stuff?

15:17.468 --> 15:20.130
You will spend two hours in this room...

15:20.304 --> 15:23.501
...every day starting at 3:00 sharp.
Got it?

15:24.975 --> 15:26.033
Vice Principal Grimes.

15:26.210 --> 15:29.976
<i>Championships coming up, don't you think
an athletic exemption might be in order?</i>

15:30.147 --> 15:31.774
Athletic exemption?

15:31.949 --> 15:34.213
What about an exemption
for the science fair?

15:34.751 --> 15:37.219
The destruction of my prototype
is gonna set me back--

15:37.387 --> 15:38.513
Stop it!

15:38.689 --> 15:40.156
Just stop it.

15:40.657 --> 15:43.057
<i>l cannot believe what l'm hearing.</i>

15:43.227 --> 15:46.856
Petty squabbling over athletics, science.

15:47.331 --> 15:48.423
Meanwhile...

15:48.599 --> 15:51.159
-...the school play is in jeopardy.
-Oh, my goodness.

15:51.335 --> 15:54.998
School play? Come on.
-Oh, ''state championships.''

15:55.172 --> 15:57.231
Enough!

15:57.407 --> 15:59.170
No exemptions.

15:59.343 --> 16:00.901
No exceptions.

16:01.078 --> 16:03.273
No excuses.

16:03.447 --> 16:05.938
<i>You're going to be spending
a lot of time together.</i>

16:06.116 --> 16:08.550
Better get used to it.

16:10.120 --> 16:12.111
<i>Maybe just a pass for today's pep rally?</i>

16:12.890 --> 16:14.414
Gotcha.

16:18.228 --> 16:20.856
The rules for detention
are the same as in the library.

16:21.031 --> 16:24.091
That means no talking, no texting...

16:24.268 --> 16:26.930
-...and no eating.
-No fair.

16:27.104 --> 16:30.540
So, like, what the heck are we supposed
to do in a library for two hours?

16:30.707 --> 16:32.607
Try reading a book.

16:35.579 --> 16:36.978
Bad enough they cut my budget.

16:37.147 --> 16:40.742
<i>Now l've gotta do double-duty
with a bunch of illiterates.</i>

16:52.362 --> 16:56.264
Hey, like, look at that,
you all like mysteries, huh?

16:56.433 --> 17:00.460
<i>Yeah, l'm not so into them myself.
You know, they kind of freak me out.</i>

17:01.238 --> 17:03.763
And, you know,
you never know who did it until the end.

17:04.441 --> 17:07.740
<i>But hey, l'm open-minded,
l'll give them another chance.</i>

17:07.911 --> 17:09.435
Anyone got an extra book?

17:15.319 --> 17:19.881
<i>Right. Thanks.
But l'll just pretend l'm in class.</i>

17:26.063 --> 17:28.998
<i>Hey, l'm sorry about bumping into you
like that on the bus.</i>

17:29.166 --> 17:32.158
<i>-lt really was an accident.
-lt's okay, whatever.</i>

17:32.336 --> 17:33.963
<i>-No, l didn't mean to--
-Okay, look.</i>

17:34.137 --> 17:38.733
<i>l really just wanna finish my book.
l'm just getting to the good part.</i>

17:39.042 --> 17:40.373
Okay, okay.

17:40.944 --> 17:42.878
No problem.

17:48.719 --> 17:51.586
-What?
-Oh, nothing.

17:51.755 --> 17:54.883
l just find it interesting
that you apologized to the pretty girl...

17:55.058 --> 17:58.323
...and not to the girl whose science project
you destroyed.

17:58.495 --> 18:00.588
<i>l didn't apologize
because it wasn't my fault.</i>

18:00.764 --> 18:04.860
<i>Right, just like it's not your fault
that he falls to the floor every morning.</i>

18:05.035 --> 18:06.525
<i>lt's not.</i>

18:06.703 --> 18:09.797
<i>Well, you don't exactly
do anything to stop it, so....</i>

18:10.707 --> 18:12.572
<i>He's my friend.
What am l supposed to do?</i>

18:12.743 --> 18:14.210
Some friend.

18:14.378 --> 18:16.608
<i>He's not my ''friend'' friend.</i>

18:16.780 --> 18:21.649
<i>-We just play on the same team, that's all.
-Yeah, the Coolsville Neanderthals.</i>

18:23.086 --> 18:26.749
Okay, you know what? Forget all of you.
l was just trying to be nice.

18:30.594 --> 18:32.858
Oh, and by the way,
l already read that one.

18:33.030 --> 18:34.861
The old innkeeper did it.

18:35.032 --> 18:37.125
<i>-Oh, no, you didn't.
-l did.</i>

18:37.300 --> 18:41.168
-Hey, l was gonna read that one next.
-Sorry.

18:56.453 --> 18:59.217
<i>Oh, you've completely ruined everything.</i>

19:04.261 --> 19:06.229
<i>Oh, what's going on?</i>

19:15.539 --> 19:19.999
Oh, wow,
brain freeze without the slushy.

19:21.545 --> 19:22.773
Cool.

19:22.946 --> 19:28.646
Unusual climatic anomaly.
There must be a logical explanation for this.

19:46.336 --> 19:50.602
<i>l've heard of books flying off the shelves,
but this is ridiculous. Ow!</i>

19:56.313 --> 19:58.577
Oh, no! Oh, boy.

20:05.922 --> 20:08.914
So much for a logical explanation.

20:21.505 --> 20:23.803
Go. Go! Go, go!

20:23.974 --> 20:25.236
Go!

20:37.320 --> 20:43.225
And now, it is my great pleasure
to introduce those crazy cats...

20:43.393 --> 20:44.951
<i>...of Eerie County.</i>

20:45.128 --> 20:46.152
<i>The Coolsville...</i>

20:46.329 --> 20:48.559
...Cougars!

20:53.003 --> 20:54.231
Go, Cougars?

20:55.238 --> 20:58.071
Run! Everybody run!

20:59.676 --> 21:02.270
<i> Run? There's no big rush.
Run, run!</i>

21:27.037 --> 21:29.267
Students of Coolsville High...

21:29.706 --> 21:34.405
...leave this place now,
or pay for all eternity.

21:34.578 --> 21:38.571
Whoever chooses to remain here
will be doomed.

21:38.748 --> 21:41.182
Hear me? Doomed.

21:43.820 --> 21:46.050
Single file. Single file, please.
Everyone-- No!

21:46.590 --> 21:50.026
Fire drill procedures, please.

21:50.193 --> 21:53.458
Everyone, just calm down.
The late buses will be here soon...

21:53.630 --> 21:57.464
...and, well, l suppose we should consider
canceling classes tomorrow.

21:57.634 --> 21:59.932
What? Cancel classes?

22:00.103 --> 22:02.435
With all due respect, sir,
l strongly disagree.

22:02.606 --> 22:05.632
<i>-But l--
-lt's obvious what's going on around here.</i>

22:05.809 --> 22:08.334
<i>Clearly, we've been made victims
of some sort of prank.</i>

22:08.511 --> 22:11.605
-But why would ghosts pull a prank?
-There are no ghosts.

22:11.781 --> 22:16.775
This is all a hoax perpetrated
by a group of students with an ax to grind.

22:16.953 --> 22:19.979
-Them.
-But we were in detention.

22:20.156 --> 22:21.418
Exactly.

22:21.591 --> 22:25.755
You were the only ones not at the pep rally,
giving you opportunity on top of motive.

22:26.663 --> 22:30.724
lt gives me great pleasure to inform you
that you no longer have detentions.

22:30.901 --> 22:35.167
<i>-Oh, l was freaking out.
-Because now you're all suspended.</i>

22:36.072 --> 22:37.437
Suspended?

22:37.607 --> 22:40.075
<i>But won't that go
on our permanent records?</i>

22:40.243 --> 22:43.041
<i>l'll make sure of it.</i>

22:44.614 --> 22:48.812
Grimes, we really must discuss this.
No running. No running.

22:48.985 --> 22:50.418
Suspended?

22:50.587 --> 22:52.054
What am l gonna tell my parents?

22:52.222 --> 22:54.213
<i>Hey, l'm gonna have to run away
from home.</i>

22:54.391 --> 22:55.756
Oh, no, mother.

22:55.926 --> 22:58.759
<i>l know you'll believe me
when l tell you l did nothing wrong.</i>

22:59.262 --> 23:00.559
lt was ghosts.

23:00.730 --> 23:02.527
Ghosts.

23:04.401 --> 23:09.270
<i>Ghosts. Like, that's what Scooby
was saying. Not ''roasts,'' ''ghosts.''</i>

23:09.439 --> 23:11.100
Hey, wait up!

23:11.274 --> 23:13.765
<i>Like, maybe we don't have to
tell our parents.</i>

23:13.944 --> 23:17.471
l know someone
who can help us clear our names.

23:19.149 --> 23:21.617
Scooby-Doo, where are you?

23:22.485 --> 23:24.009
Right here.

23:24.487 --> 23:27.115
<i>There he is. Handsome devil, isn't he?</i>

23:34.531 --> 23:38.023
<i>l can't believe this.
Following a dog to find a ghost?</i>

23:38.201 --> 23:40.601
<i>l can't believe
we're trying to find a ghost at all.</i>

23:40.770 --> 23:43.238
<i>l mean, l don't even think
l believe in ghosts.</i>

23:43.406 --> 23:45.067
While l too am skeptical...

23:45.241 --> 23:49.007
<i>...there's volumes of evidence supporting
the existence of the supernatural.</i>

23:49.546 --> 23:55.416
And historically, canines have been proven
to be highly sensitive to paranormal activity.

23:59.289 --> 24:01.689
Well, we have to try something...

24:01.858 --> 24:04.190
-...if we wanna clear our names.
-Awesome.

24:11.101 --> 24:12.534
Cemetery?

24:13.670 --> 24:16.503
Okay, so now that we know
where the ghosts came from...

24:16.673 --> 24:20.473
...we can just go home
and alert the authorities, and leave.

24:20.643 --> 24:22.804
<i>Oh, guys,
you can't be serious about this.</i>

24:22.979 --> 24:25.311
<i>We're not actually going to a cemetery,
are we?</i>

24:29.152 --> 24:32.553
You sure this is where
you saw those ghosts, Scoob?

24:32.722 --> 24:35.748
Yeah. Sorry.

24:43.266 --> 24:44.392
Boo.

24:45.502 --> 24:48.062
<i>You're not scared, are you?</i>

24:48.238 --> 24:49.330
What?

24:49.506 --> 24:50.598
No.

24:50.774 --> 24:55.074
<i>No. l'm a football player.
We have no fear.</i>

24:55.245 --> 24:56.906
<i>lt's just....</i>

24:57.914 --> 24:59.506
No.

25:00.417 --> 25:04.285
Some of these graves
are over a hundred years old.

25:04.788 --> 25:07.951
That one dates all the way back
to the great Coolsville flood.

25:08.124 --> 25:10.319
Coolsville flood?

25:10.493 --> 25:13.826
Right before the turn of the century,
the Eerie Dam burst...

25:13.997 --> 25:15.897
...and all of Coolsville was washed away.

25:16.666 --> 25:19.567
A whole new town was built
right on top of the old one.

25:21.871 --> 25:25.136
Looks like a lot of these people
lost their lives on that fateful day.

25:26.242 --> 25:31.111
<i>Zoinks. Like, we're not expecting rain,
are we? Ow.</i>

25:33.116 --> 25:36.745
-Hey, l think your dog found something.
-Over here.

25:40.323 --> 25:41.881
''Prudence Prufrock.''

25:42.058 --> 25:43.525
''Ezekial Gallows.''

25:43.693 --> 25:48.130
''Keep off the grass.'' l made a funny.

25:48.298 --> 25:50.926
Who are they?
And why are they buried together?

25:51.101 --> 25:54.537
<i>-l mean, they don't seem to be related.
-l don't know.</i>

25:54.704 --> 25:57.730
<i>But there's something about these names
that's very familiar.</i>

25:57.907 --> 26:01.104
<i>l just know l've seen them
someplace before.</i>

26:02.278 --> 26:05.679
<i>Looks like following you
wasn't a bad idea after all, was it, boy?</i>

26:05.849 --> 26:07.316
Yeah.

26:08.418 --> 26:13.549
So-- So if Scooby saw those ghosts
come out of these graves...

26:13.723 --> 26:16.021
...then that means they must be real.

26:16.192 --> 26:19.787
<i>Fake ghosts don't come from real graves,
do they?</i>

26:20.163 --> 26:22.188
l guess not.

26:22.499 --> 26:25.798
But hold on.
There were three ghosts at the pep rally

26:26.436 --> 26:28.404
Then why are there only two graves?

26:28.571 --> 26:32.632
Well, looks like we officially
have a mystery on our hands.

26:34.844 --> 26:37.142
<i>Let's meet up tomorrow at--</i>

26:37.313 --> 26:38.507
Wait.

26:38.681 --> 26:40.808
<i>Where can we meet?
We're not allowed at school.</i>

26:40.984 --> 26:44.112
<i>We can't go to my house.
The staff would just love to rat me out.</i>

26:44.287 --> 26:47.779
<i>-Staff?
-Oh, no, no, no. lt's not a staff.</i>

26:47.957 --> 26:51.256
<i>lt's just two maids, a butler,
a groundskeeper--</i>

26:51.427 --> 26:54.487
<i>-Oh, and my dad's valet.
-No, not a staff.</i>

26:55.465 --> 26:58.161
Hey, you can all come over to my place.

26:58.334 --> 27:02.202
My parents both work
and l got the whole basement to myself.

27:03.106 --> 27:04.437
Yeah, wait till you see it.

27:04.607 --> 27:10.375
l mean, l got a TV, a CD, a DVD, an MP3,
and l even have my own bathroom...

27:10.547 --> 27:13.448
-...if you have to go--
-We all got it, Shaggy.

27:14.184 --> 27:16.015
-See you there.
See you tomorrow.

27:18.354 --> 27:20.948
<i>How about that, Scoob?
We're having company.</i>

27:21.124 --> 27:23.092
Oh, boy.

27:28.932 --> 27:32.868
<i>Feel better, honey.
There's extra chicken soup in the fridge.</i>

27:34.537 --> 27:38.530
<i>Thanks, Ma. And don't worry about me.</i>

27:39.075 --> 27:43.102
<i>l'll be on my cell phone
all day if you need anything.</i>

27:46.082 --> 27:50.018
<i>Hey, come on, Scoob.
Let's get this place cleaned up.</i>

28:05.768 --> 28:08.293
Perfect timing. Fred, Daphne.
-Hey, Shaggy.

28:08.471 --> 28:10.666
Welcome to the party.

28:11.007 --> 28:12.668
Party?

28:13.042 --> 28:16.443
<i>Oh, like, yeah.
lt's always a party here at Shagwell Manor.</i>

28:16.613 --> 28:18.877
May l take your coats?

28:19.549 --> 28:22.143
l mean, please sit down.

28:22.318 --> 28:23.546
Make yourselves at home.

28:23.720 --> 28:26.416
-Sweet pad, Shag.
-Thank you.

28:31.394 --> 28:32.486
<i>l'm sorry.</i>

28:32.662 --> 28:33.959
-This is an old couch.
-Yeah.

28:34.130 --> 28:36.530
-And legs.
-Old. Yeah.

28:36.833 --> 28:38.198
Bon appétit.

28:38.801 --> 28:40.359
Thanks.

28:41.671 --> 28:43.764
-Wow, these are really good.
-Yeah.

28:43.940 --> 28:44.964
What are they?

28:45.141 --> 28:47.939
<i>No, they don't have a name,
just something l whipped up.</i>

28:48.111 --> 28:51.171
You know, eggs, water,
flour, cocoa, sugar...

28:51.714 --> 28:53.978
...and a little dog kibble for texture.

28:57.754 --> 29:00.279
- lt was good.
-Delicious.

29:02.759 --> 29:03.783
Oh, Scoob.

29:05.795 --> 29:07.387
<i>You didn't save any for Velma.</i>

29:12.435 --> 29:13.663
-Greetings.
-Hi.

29:13.836 --> 29:15.701
l found those names
from the gravestones.

29:22.045 --> 29:24.843
You are not gonna believe this.

29:27.283 --> 29:29.148
Oh, sorry.

29:30.053 --> 29:35.457
Prudence Prufrock and Ezekial Gallows.
The founding faculty of Coolsville Academy.

29:35.625 --> 29:37.718
<i>And time capsule? What's that?</i>

29:37.894 --> 29:40.692
<i>lt's a container used to preserve
historical artifacts...</i>

29:40.863 --> 29:43.354
...in order to capture a certain time.

29:43.866 --> 29:45.493
What will they think of next?

29:47.303 --> 29:48.702
According to this article...

29:48.871 --> 29:52.238
...Gallows and Prufrock were set to open
the doors to their new school...

29:52.408 --> 29:53.898
...when tragedy struck.

29:54.077 --> 29:59.845
The flood destroyed Coolsville Academy,
and the two founding faculty were killed.

30:01.918 --> 30:03.317
Spooky, huh?

30:03.486 --> 30:06.853
lt says here that like the rest of the town,
the new school was built...

30:07.023 --> 30:09.491
...right over the ruins of the old school.

30:09.659 --> 30:13.254
This is great, Velma. That explains two
of the ghosts, and if we figure out...

30:13.429 --> 30:16.694
<i>...who the third one is, we'll be
much closer to clearing our names.</i>

30:16.866 --> 30:20.768
You know what we need to do?
Go back to the scene of the crime.

30:20.937 --> 30:24.873
<i>But how? We can't be seen
back on school grounds.</i>

30:25.041 --> 30:28.636
<i>Then we'll have to use the cover of night
as our silent ally.</i>

30:28.811 --> 30:32.269
<i>Yes, it'll be just like in one
of our mystery books.</i>

30:34.050 --> 30:36.041
Have you been eating dog food?

30:36.219 --> 30:38.653
Yeah. Good for the coat.

30:40.223 --> 30:41.656
Oh, yum.

30:51.534 --> 30:53.764
<i>Okay. Let's do this.</i>

31:21.631 --> 31:24.691
Okay, we can cover more ground
if we split up and search for clues.

31:24.867 --> 31:27.301
-Daphne, you come with me and--
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:27.470 --> 31:28.994
Why do l have to go with you?

31:29.172 --> 31:33.700
<i>Yeah, who made you boss?
Why can't we pick our own teams?</i>

31:34.477 --> 31:38.106
-Well, l just thought--
-You just wanted to go with the hottie.

31:39.782 --> 31:43.718
<i>l did not. And just for the record,
l don't even think she's that hot.</i>

31:43.886 --> 31:45.148
Oh, really?

31:45.721 --> 31:49.782
-Well, just for the record--
-Guys, like, can we just get to it?

31:49.959 --> 31:52.655
<i>Seriously, the school's scary enough
during the day.</i>

31:53.729 --> 31:56.129
Fine. How about we all just go together?

31:56.299 --> 31:58.358
-Fine.
-Works for me.

32:02.638 --> 32:05.198
-Touchy bunch, huh?
-Uh-huh.

32:09.345 --> 32:13.372
<i> Find out what they're up to,
then get rid of them.</i>

32:52.054 --> 32:55.717
All right, guys. Our objective here
is to gather forensic evidence.

32:55.892 --> 33:00.192
And keep an eye out
for that tooth l lost playing dodge ball.

33:00.363 --> 33:04.766
<i>Oh, hope you don't mind, l took the liberty
of borrowing this for our investigation.</i>

33:04.934 --> 33:07.061
Look at that. Groovy and practical.

33:08.004 --> 33:10.939
-Jinkies. Look at this.
-What is it?

33:11.641 --> 33:12.801
<i>l'm not sure.</i>

33:12.975 --> 33:16.877
But this is directly under where the
spectral figure appeared and disappeared.

33:21.717 --> 33:24.413
Do you always carry slides with you?

33:24.587 --> 33:26.714
What good is a microscope
without slides?

33:27.356 --> 33:28.948
Right.

33:35.598 --> 33:37.122
You see anything?

33:40.836 --> 33:42.997
Ghost! Ghost!

33:43.172 --> 33:44.503
Boo.

33:46.309 --> 33:47.936
Going somewhere?

33:51.314 --> 33:53.942
Hey, how about playing a few downs
with me?

33:55.718 --> 33:58.448
<i>-Go! Let's go!
-After them.</i>

34:03.326 --> 34:06.955
-Hey, come on.
-Care to play around?

34:10.266 --> 34:14.168
<i>-You think we lost him?
-l don't think so.</i>

34:16.472 --> 34:20.101
-Oh, too low, princess. Come on.
-Your luck just ran out.

34:27.516 --> 34:29.210
The Specter.

34:31.320 --> 34:32.786
Costume?

34:33.989 --> 34:35.456
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

34:38.761 --> 34:42.629
All right, no more playing around.
Come at me. Come on.

34:49.371 --> 34:53.034
-Come out, wherever you are.
-Oh, no.

34:54.810 --> 34:56.208
l got it.

34:58.581 --> 35:00.071
ls that all you got?

35:00.249 --> 35:03.218
<i>-Come on.
-Let's try a different game.</i>

35:25.007 --> 35:27.441
<i>Yeah. Now that's how a Cougar does it.</i>

35:29.045 --> 35:33.106
Follow me, Scoob.
l know the perfect place to hide.

35:44.326 --> 35:46.920
Next time, ladies.

35:48.898 --> 35:53.267
<i>-Come on, Velma. Let's make tracks.
- l'm right behind you.</i>

35:56.972 --> 35:59.566
-Like, time for a nutrition break, eh, Scoob?
-Yeah.

35:59.742 --> 36:01.903
First, a grammar lesson.

36:02.078 --> 36:06.538
-Never start a sentence with ''like.''
-Like, sorry.

36:09.051 --> 36:11.747
<i>-Let's go, Scoob.
-Okay.</i>

36:16.892 --> 36:18.450
Hey, Scoob.

36:18.627 --> 36:22.063
<i>-Where are we?
-l don't know, Shaggy.</i>

36:25.301 --> 36:26.700
Oh, no.

36:26.869 --> 36:30.703
How do you like that?
Undone by the thing we love most.

36:30.873 --> 36:33.171
lrony. Ech!

36:35.945 --> 36:38.345
Giddy up, Daphne.

36:43.185 --> 36:45.915
Never come back.

36:50.626 --> 36:53.026
Hey, wait up. Wait up.

36:55.898 --> 37:00.096
<i>You're okay. l was gonna call you
but l didn't know your last name.</i>

37:00.269 --> 37:01.566
Really?

37:01.737 --> 37:02.795
You were gonna call me?

37:02.972 --> 37:05.964
<i>Yeah, l didn't-- l thought
if you got stuck in the school...</i>

37:06.142 --> 37:08.940
<i>...then we'd all get in more trouble,
l didn't want that so--</i>

37:09.411 --> 37:11.038
<i>That's why you were gonna call.</i>

37:11.680 --> 37:13.113
<i>My last name's Jones.</i>

37:13.549 --> 37:14.641
<i>Mine's Blake.</i>

37:15.317 --> 37:17.308
-Dinkley.
-Pardon?

37:17.486 --> 37:18.510
My surname.

37:18.988 --> 37:20.853
<i>lt's Dinkley.</i>

37:21.056 --> 37:22.080
-Yeah.
-Oh, cool.

37:22.258 --> 37:23.350
Yeah.

37:23.526 --> 37:26.427
So Dinkley and Blake,
you guys heard from Shaggy and Scooby?

37:26.595 --> 37:28.222
l was hoping they got out with you.

37:30.199 --> 37:31.393
-Help.
-Help.

37:31.567 --> 37:33.592
-Someone help.
-Help.

37:33.769 --> 37:35.930
Help us.

37:36.705 --> 37:39.173
<i>Oh, we're saved.</i>

37:42.411 --> 37:44.971
<i>-Oh, we're doomed.
-Doomed?</i>

37:49.585 --> 37:52.748
Whoa, look at this place.

37:54.690 --> 37:58.888
-Extreme makeover, ghost edition.
-These paranormal poltergeists...

37:59.061 --> 38:02.519
<i>-...aren't pussyfooting around.
-What are we gonna do?</i>

38:02.698 --> 38:06.361
Same thing they do in our mystery books.
We have to examine the clues.

38:06.535 --> 38:08.059
Way ahead of you, Freddie.

38:08.237 --> 38:11.729
l analyzed that green residue
from the gym floor. And guess what it is.

38:11.907 --> 38:15.172
Magnesium chlorate. Can you believe it?

38:15.644 --> 38:16.804
Of course.

38:16.979 --> 38:19.675
Magnesium chlorate
is a highly-combustible substance...

38:19.849 --> 38:24.343
<i>...that can be used to create an explosion
identical to the third ghost's smoke screen.</i>

38:25.254 --> 38:26.915
How did you--?

38:27.089 --> 38:30.286
<i>-l can read upside down.
-That's great.</i>

38:30.459 --> 38:34.054
But why would a ghost
need a smoke screen?

38:34.230 --> 38:36.528
Because maybe....

38:36.699 --> 38:38.690
<i>Maybe he's not a ghost at all.</i>

38:38.868 --> 38:41.666
Remember, last night,
we thought we saw the third ghost...

38:41.837 --> 38:45.034
<i>...it was just one of the Greek chorus
costumes from Julius Caesar.</i>

38:45.207 --> 38:47.937
l guess that would explain
why there are only two graves...

38:48.110 --> 38:51.876
<i>...but l still don't understand
how someone wearing a costume could fly.</i>

38:52.047 --> 38:56.279
l do. The safety rigging. You know
that thing they use for gymnastics?

38:56.452 --> 39:00.479
When l was facing off against the ghost,
you know, head-to-head, football style.

39:01.090 --> 39:04.423
-Shake and bake and just a little stiff-arm.
-We get it.

39:04.593 --> 39:08.256
Right, well, l used the gymnastics harness
to escape.

39:08.430 --> 39:11.024
And l bet it sure looked like l was flying.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.327
<i>Okay. So what we've deduced...</i>

39:13.502 --> 39:17.097
<i>...is that there's one sneaky human
working with two real ghosts.</i>

39:17.273 --> 39:20.572
Exactly. Come on, this has to be enough
to clear our names.

39:24.046 --> 39:27.846
Principal Deedle, we have some
information about the ghosts.

39:28.017 --> 39:29.541
The ghosts?

39:29.718 --> 39:32.778
What more information do we need
except that they want us to leave?

39:32.955 --> 39:36.686
l was about to call the superintendent
to insist on the immediate closure of--

39:36.859 --> 39:38.019
-Nonsense.
-What?

39:38.193 --> 39:42.926
<i>l've got your ghosts right here.
l found these two in the freezer.</i>

39:43.098 --> 39:45.498
<i>Obviously, they'd been there all night.</i>

39:47.036 --> 39:49.436
<i>l'm out of here.</i>

39:49.605 --> 39:53.041
<i>Which would've given them ample time
to do all this.</i>

39:53.208 --> 39:55.073
What? Are you sure?

39:55.244 --> 39:58.475
Because this seems like an awful lot
of damage for a couple of--

39:58.647 --> 40:01.309
Principal Deedle,
l am more than familiar...

40:01.483 --> 40:03.713
<i>...with the troublemaker's capacity
for damage.</i>

40:03.886 --> 40:06.616
That is why you put me in charge
of discipline, remember?

40:06.789 --> 40:11.089
<i>-Now, Vice Principal Grimes, l really don't--
-l will handle it, Principal Deedle.</i>

40:12.928 --> 40:15.556
Vice Principal Grimes,
you have to believe me.

40:15.731 --> 40:18.131
<i>We didn't do any of this.
lt really was the ghosts.</i>

40:18.300 --> 40:20.268
They locked us in the freezer.

40:20.436 --> 40:22.267
Oh, and they ate all the ice cream too.

40:22.438 --> 40:25.839
Right. More ghost stories.

40:26.008 --> 40:28.704
So do we have all of you
to thank for this?

40:28.877 --> 40:32.176
Or did Ben and Jerry here
act alone this time?

40:33.615 --> 40:35.242
-Well--
-Well--

40:35.417 --> 40:36.975
-We were kind of--
-Well--

40:37.152 --> 40:38.585
No.

40:40.055 --> 40:41.716
No, it was just us.

40:45.094 --> 40:49.190
Fine. l wish l could say your cooperation
would mitigate your punishment.

40:49.365 --> 40:50.559
<i>But it won't.</i>

40:52.601 --> 40:55.069
<i>Hold on. lt wasn't just them.</i>

40:55.237 --> 40:57.102
l was there too.

40:57.439 --> 40:58.906
So was l.

40:59.074 --> 41:03.875
<i>Yeah, mea culpa as well.
But that doesn't mean we did any of this.</i>

41:04.046 --> 41:08.210
<i>Someone's working with the ghosts to close
the school. We have evidence to prove it.</i>

41:08.384 --> 41:11.251
Oh, really? Evidence?

41:11.420 --> 41:13.718
Do tell. Who?

41:13.889 --> 41:16.756
Who is working with the ghosts?

41:16.925 --> 41:18.222
ls it Dracula?

41:18.794 --> 41:23.595
-Frankenstein? The Wolf Man?
-Wow, this goes deeper than we thought.

41:25.367 --> 41:27.927
<i>Well, we're not exactly clear on who...</i>

41:28.103 --> 41:31.800
...or why, but the evidence
is impressive nonetheless.

41:31.974 --> 41:35.671
<i>What's impressive is the amount of damage
you've done to this school.</i>

41:36.578 --> 41:40.742
Well, l am pleased to inform you
that your suspensions have been lifted.

41:40.916 --> 41:42.975
Hallelujah.

41:43.152 --> 41:47.486
<i>-Because now you're all expelled.
-Even better. Oh, wait.</i>

41:47.656 --> 41:50.750
And if you set one foot
on school property ever again...

41:50.926 --> 41:53.156
...l will have you all arrested
for trespassing.

41:56.532 --> 41:58.693
Well, that went well.

41:58.867 --> 42:02.860
Hey, thanks for not letting me
go down alone back there.

42:03.038 --> 42:05.268
<i>No one's ever stood up for me
like that before.</i>

42:05.974 --> 42:06.998
Shag...

42:07.176 --> 42:09.303
<i>-...we're all in this together.
-Yeah.</i>

42:09.478 --> 42:12.504
Unless we figure out who would want
the school closed and why...

42:12.681 --> 42:15.878
<i>...we'll all be flipping burgers together.</i>

42:29.865 --> 42:34.097
l hate this school.
Never wanted to be a janitor.

42:37.673 --> 42:39.231
Bad enough they cut my budget...

42:39.408 --> 42:43.071
<i>...now l've gotta do double-duty
with a bunch of illiterates.</i>

42:46.248 --> 42:48.182
What are you looking at?

42:49.718 --> 42:51.982
Guys, we got suspects.

42:55.958 --> 42:59.394
Well, thanks to Shaggy,
now we have our suspects.

42:59.561 --> 43:03.361
<i>But how are we gonna investigate them?
We can't be seen anywhere near the school.</i>

43:03.532 --> 43:04.794
Exactly.

43:04.967 --> 43:08.198
<i>We can't be seen anywhere
near the school.</i>

43:08.504 --> 43:11.667
Cool. An invisibility serum?

43:11.840 --> 43:17.801
Actually, l was thinking
of a more theatrical approach.

43:22.384 --> 43:24.011
Hold still.

43:24.586 --> 43:29.649
<i>-Ouch! Daphne, l don't know about this.
-Just stop squirming and trust me.</i>

43:29.825 --> 43:31.884
<i>-Okay, let's just get this over with.
-Okay.</i>

43:32.060 --> 43:33.618
Okay.

43:34.263 --> 43:37.562
-Oh! Okay. This is just--
-Hey, hey, hey.

43:37.733 --> 43:39.701
<i>Don't be such a baby. Okay?</i>

43:39.868 --> 43:42.336
<i>You'll be surprised
with a little bit of blush...</i>

43:42.504 --> 43:44.529
...and a simple pair of tweezers can do.

43:44.706 --> 43:49.109
<i>Oh, please.
Like, there'll actually be a noticeable.</i>

43:49.278 --> 43:51.974
-Metamorphosis.
-You see that?

43:52.147 --> 43:55.605
An extra 1 0 minutes a day
and your phone would never stop ringing.

43:55.784 --> 43:57.342
An extra 1 0 minutes?

43:57.519 --> 44:00.488
<i>Well, l'm not devoting enough time
to my extra-curriculars...</i>

44:00.656 --> 44:03.124
-...and volunteer work as it is.
-Oh, come on.

44:03.292 --> 44:05.487
<i>There's always time for makeup.</i>

44:05.661 --> 44:06.889
And boys.

44:08.263 --> 44:09.457
Well...

44:09.631 --> 44:14.193
...it would be kind of nice to have someone
to escort me to the chess club socials.

44:14.369 --> 44:15.393
<i>That's the spirit.</i>

44:16.805 --> 44:22.209
<i>What about Fred? He's pretty cute, right?
Do you think he would--? Ouch!</i>

44:22.377 --> 44:26.279
Oh, sorry. lt slipped.

44:37.292 --> 44:41.388
So the Bears really slaughtered
those Dolphins last night, huh?

44:41.563 --> 44:43.326
<i>What? That's terrible.</i>

44:43.498 --> 44:46.092
Who in their right mind
would bring bears to the beach?

44:46.268 --> 44:47.792
No, not real--

44:47.970 --> 44:50.404
<i>Look, you don't watch a lot of sports,
do you, Shag?</i>

44:50.572 --> 44:54.133
<i>Sure l do. l'm a big fan of the MLE.</i>

44:54.943 --> 44:56.433
Wait, what?

44:56.612 --> 44:59.581
Oh, the MLE. Major League Eating.

44:59.748 --> 45:04.242
You know, like that Japanese guy
that ate 58 hot dogs in under three minutes.

45:04.419 --> 45:07.877
<i>-lt's thrilling.
-That sounds pretty cool.</i>

45:08.056 --> 45:10.684
<i>Hey, if you want,
l'll take you to the next match.</i>

45:10.859 --> 45:15.262
<i>Here's a tip, though. lf you wanna
sit in the front, bring a poncho.</i>

45:15.430 --> 45:16.761
<i>All right, l'm there.</i>

45:18.066 --> 45:19.090
Now introducing...

45:19.268 --> 45:24.171
...the new and improved Velma Dinkley.

45:28.810 --> 45:32.211
-Jinkies.
-Hubba-hubba.

45:32.848 --> 45:36.682
-You can say that again, Scoob.
-Hubba-hubba.

45:39.554 --> 45:41.681
What are you guys staring at?

45:41.857 --> 45:44.690
<i>-lt's just a disguise.
-Mm-hm.</i>

45:45.527 --> 45:47.961
So, what are we gonna go as?

46:18.593 --> 46:19.685
Look.

46:28.537 --> 46:31.062
PDAs. Against the code of conduct.
Break it up.

46:35.110 --> 46:37.408
And pull your pants up, droopy drawers.

46:41.450 --> 46:44.078
-Good thinking.
-Thanks.

46:47.155 --> 46:48.884
<i>What's wrong with you two?</i>

46:49.491 --> 46:51.425
-Nothing.
-Yeah.

46:51.593 --> 46:53.458
<i>Yo, let's do this.</i>

46:56.698 --> 46:58.996
Like, wait for me.

47:20.655 --> 47:22.885
Nice job, guys. Now keep watch.

47:23.592 --> 47:25.492
Roger that.

47:48.717 --> 47:49.911
Look.

47:50.085 --> 47:52.178
<i>-lt's him.</i>

47:55.323 --> 47:58.190
Hi. l never wanted to be a janitor.

47:58.360 --> 47:59.987
l always wanted to be...

48:00.162 --> 48:04.963
<i>...America's next dancing star.</i>

48:29.558 --> 48:32.322
Hey, what are you kids doing down here?

48:33.261 --> 48:35.627
Take two.

49:08.530 --> 49:09.792
Yes.

49:09.965 --> 49:13.162
Soon this school will vex me no more.

49:19.441 --> 49:22.899
''We are pleased to inform you
that Coolsville University Library...

49:23.078 --> 49:26.411
...would like to offer you
a senior position on our staff.''

49:26.681 --> 49:30.048
Huzah! Books without pictures.

49:40.195 --> 49:43.130
Jinkies. What do we have here?

49:43.298 --> 49:46.028
<i>l'd forget my bun
if it wasn't attached to my head--</i>

49:47.202 --> 49:50.467
<i>What are you doing?
Students aren't allowed back here.</i>

49:52.340 --> 49:55.400
Exchange student. Very lost.

49:55.577 --> 49:56.976
ls that a Russian accent l detect?

49:59.047 --> 50:00.412
How wonderful.

50:00.582 --> 50:04.746
l spent a semester studying the language
at the University of Moscow.

50:24.739 --> 50:28.800
How l miss the Russian sense of humor.

50:28.977 --> 50:30.604
That was a good one.

50:37.319 --> 50:39.753
<i>l just can't believe
the janitor checked out.</i>

50:39.921 --> 50:43.084
l mean, l thought for sure
that guy was dirty.

50:44.759 --> 50:46.920
l get it. Janitor. Dirty.

50:48.930 --> 50:51.694
Well, hopefully Velma found something.

50:51.866 --> 50:54.926
You bet your Bunsen burner l did.

50:55.103 --> 50:56.661
-The librarian did it?
-No.

50:56.838 --> 51:00.001
-How--? How did you--?
-She seems to be innocent.

51:00.175 --> 51:02.803
But l did find something
in a box of old books.

51:02.978 --> 51:04.502
Take a look at this.

51:04.679 --> 51:07.546
<i>lt's a three-volume set of books
about the supernatural.</i>

51:07.983 --> 51:10.451
<i>''Volume One:
Ghostly Hauntings, a History. ''</i>

51:11.886 --> 51:15.515
<i>''Volume Two:
Common Spells, Curses and Hexes. ''</i>

51:15.690 --> 51:19.956
<i>''Volume Three:
A Practical Guide to Raising the Dead...</i>

51:20.128 --> 51:22.494
<i>...and How to Use Them
for Your Own Evil Purposes. ''</i>

51:22.664 --> 51:24.655
<i>That's the one we need
to get our hands on.</i>

51:24.833 --> 51:28.462
<i>But it's missing.
And look who checked it out last.</i>

51:31.039 --> 51:34.065
-Vice Principal Grimes?
-We gotta check him out.

51:34.242 --> 51:38.042
-Velma, can you find out where he lives?
-Already on it, Freddie.

51:39.781 --> 51:43.478
Oh, no. He lives on top of
Coolsville Mountain.

51:43.652 --> 51:46.177
<i>lt'd take us all night to ride our bikes
up there.</i>

51:46.354 --> 51:49.812
What other choice do we have?
Wait until we get our licenses?

51:55.730 --> 51:57.561
Like, l have my license.

51:58.166 --> 51:59.827
See.

52:00.001 --> 52:02.162
You do? How?

52:02.337 --> 52:06.000
<i>Well, it's complicated. See.</i>

52:06.174 --> 52:10.372
<i>l was born on a leap year,
and l'm very tall for my age.</i>

52:10.545 --> 52:14.106
<i>-lt's because of a pituitary condition and--
-Shaggy.</i>

52:15.183 --> 52:17.743
Like, all right. l got held back.

52:19.220 --> 52:21.279
Twice.

52:25.760 --> 52:29.491
There, l said it. l just--
l just get so hungry in class...

52:29.664 --> 52:33.794
...and l have a hard time concentrating,
and-- Hey, have you always worn glasses?

52:33.968 --> 52:36.960
Shaggy, focus. We need you to drive us.

52:37.138 --> 52:40.437
<i>Well, like, l said l have my license,
but l don't have a car.</i>

52:40.909 --> 52:45.710
<i>l do. Well, at least, my dad does.
lt's mine when l turn 1 6.</i>

52:45.880 --> 52:49.281
<i>We can use it,
but we'll have to sneak it out.</i>

52:50.018 --> 52:53.249
<i>All right, gang. We'll meet at Daphne's
after our parents go to sleep.</i>

52:53.421 --> 52:54.445
Sound like a plan?

52:54.622 --> 52:56.317
-Got it.
-Stack them up.

52:56.925 --> 52:59.086
-Not quite a hands in moment.
-No.

52:59.260 --> 53:00.420
-Sorry.
-Oh, but--

53:02.330 --> 53:05.094
l thought it was opportune.

53:19.647 --> 53:21.638
Get a load of this place, eh, Scoob?

53:22.984 --> 53:24.474
Fancy-pants.

53:26.821 --> 53:28.413
Okay. Here we go.

53:32.093 --> 53:35.426
<i>-Velma, you really don't--
-Just let her go, man.</i>

53:48.777 --> 53:50.438
Check it out.

53:50.612 --> 53:52.443
Beemer.

53:53.882 --> 53:55.679
A Morgan?

53:57.919 --> 54:02.322
Oh, an MGA in British racing green?

54:03.792 --> 54:06.818
<i>-So which one's our ride?
-Right behind you.</i>

54:08.463 --> 54:10.624
How groovy.

54:10.932 --> 54:14.732
<i>Okay, look, just because my parents
are well-off doesn't mean l get everything.</i>

54:14.903 --> 54:15.927
Yeah, but--

54:16.104 --> 54:19.164
<i>lt's what the groundskeeper uses
to haul stuff around.</i>

54:20.441 --> 54:24.036
<i>When l turn 1 6,
they're buying him a new one.</i>

54:28.750 --> 54:30.377
<i>Shouldn't these things have treads?</i>

54:30.552 --> 54:35.751
<i>Three hundred thousand miles?
lt's a mystery this machine still runs.</i>

54:35.924 --> 54:38.825
<i>lt's not so bad.
All it needs is a makeover.</i>

54:38.993 --> 54:41.587
Right? l was thinking
maybe some blue and--

54:41.763 --> 54:44.027
Oh, and some big orange flowers, eh.

54:44.199 --> 54:45.689
<i>-That'd be cool, right?
-Yeah.</i>

54:46.835 --> 54:48.200
l guess.

54:48.369 --> 54:50.599
All right, Shaggy, do your thing.

54:52.907 --> 54:54.431
Right.

54:54.609 --> 54:58.943
Okay, step aside.
Fully-licensed driver coming through.

55:06.221 --> 55:08.052
Shotgun.

55:09.958 --> 55:12.722
<i>Okay, l'll sit in the back.</i>

55:18.533 --> 55:20.160
All right.

55:20.335 --> 55:23.133
<i>We'll just get going here.</i>

55:24.639 --> 55:27.472
Oh, good. Those are working.

55:29.077 --> 55:30.977
And now to just start us up.

55:32.680 --> 55:34.204
Shaggy, my parents.

55:34.649 --> 55:35.911
Sorry.

55:40.221 --> 55:42.485
<i>Shaggy, are you sure
you know what you're doing?</i>

55:42.657 --> 55:46.718
Yeah, yeah. Just l--
Just going through my checklist.

55:47.428 --> 55:48.918
Here goes.

56:00.174 --> 56:01.664
Oh, and, Shag.

56:01.843 --> 56:07.179
Go easy, all right? My dad says this van
requires a very gentle touch.

56:09.250 --> 56:10.911
<i>We're gonna die!</i>

56:13.421 --> 56:17.482
<i>-You'll wake the entire neighborhood.
-lt's just-- l'm sorry, l'm sorry.</i>

56:17.659 --> 56:20.924
l really just wanna do my part,
but l just got my license last month...

56:21.095 --> 56:23.256
<i>...and l'm having a hard time
concentrating.</i>

56:23.431 --> 56:26.229
-Hey, have you always worn glasses?
-Get it together, man.

56:26.401 --> 56:30.064
The State of Ohio issued you a license.
Now show us you deserve it.

56:30.238 --> 56:33.366
Now put your hands on the 1 0:00
and 2:00 positions...

56:33.541 --> 56:37.068
-...just like the DMV recommends.
-Okay, okay. l think l got it now.

56:37.245 --> 56:40.009
<i>Okay, that's lovely.
Now, let's hit the road.</i>

56:42.850 --> 56:44.010
There we go.

56:44.185 --> 56:46.050
As smooth as syrup.

56:46.721 --> 56:48.018
Thanks, guys.

56:48.189 --> 56:49.850
-No problem.
-No problem.

56:56.998 --> 56:59.193
Hey, Scoob, look what l got.

57:04.172 --> 57:07.403
Oh, those were supposed to last us
all night.

57:07.575 --> 57:08.701
Sorry.

57:14.415 --> 57:16.315
-What?
-Oh, nothing.

57:17.018 --> 57:18.508
<i>lt's just--</i>

57:18.686 --> 57:20.677
Since we started this investigation...

57:20.855 --> 57:23.221
...so many of my theories
have been disproved.

57:23.391 --> 57:26.258
What are you talking about?
You were right about the chemical.

57:26.427 --> 57:29.021
-And you found the name.
-No, no, not about that stuff.

57:29.197 --> 57:33.998
<i>About you. You're just not at all
the person l thought you were.</i>

57:34.168 --> 57:36.762
<i>-Who did you think l was?
- l don't know.</i>

57:37.238 --> 57:40.765
Bubble-head, snob,
spoiled princess with a daddy complex.

57:41.609 --> 57:45.067
<i>But you're not.
l was totally, indisputably wrong.</i>

57:45.546 --> 57:47.673
Thanks. l think.

57:48.216 --> 57:51.777
<i>l have to admit, you're not the girl
l thought would be behind those glasses.</i>

57:52.286 --> 57:53.617
Really?

57:53.788 --> 57:55.949
<i>-Well, what did you expect?
-l don't know.</i>

57:56.124 --> 57:57.523
Egghead, know-it-all...

57:57.692 --> 58:01.560
...alpha nerd who enjoys throwing off the
curve, making everyone else feel dumb.

58:03.231 --> 58:04.960
Jinkies.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.365
l have to admit...

58:07.535 --> 58:10.231
...there is something inside me
that likes throwing off the curve.

58:12.540 --> 58:15.065
Well, what about me?

58:17.412 --> 58:19.107
-You?
-Yeah.

58:20.114 --> 58:23.675
<i>Fred, you're exactly
what we thought you'd be.</i>

58:23.851 --> 58:25.910
-Right, Velma?
-To a T.

58:26.087 --> 58:27.987
-Come on.
-Or make than an N.

58:28.156 --> 58:30.215
For Neanderthal.

58:30.391 --> 58:32.222
Sorry for ever saying that.

58:32.393 --> 58:36.090
ln retrospect,
it was an inaccurate classification.

58:36.264 --> 58:37.925
No problem.

58:38.099 --> 58:39.794
Do me. Do me.

58:43.638 --> 58:47.233
<i>l don't think any of us
have figured you out yet, Shaggy.</i>

58:47.675 --> 58:49.666
Hey, yeah, me neither.

58:49.844 --> 58:52.210
<i>Hear that, Scoob?
We're in a class all our own.</i>

58:52.380 --> 58:54.644
-Yeah.
-Yup.

59:17.004 --> 59:18.972
This is bizarre.

59:24.045 --> 59:26.536
<i>There's no lights on.
Grimes must be asleep.</i>

59:26.714 --> 59:30.445
<i>Or he's out planning another one
of his late-night creep-fests.</i>

59:30.618 --> 59:32.984
Only one way to find out.

59:34.055 --> 59:35.682
Oh, wait.

59:35.857 --> 59:38.018
<i>So, like, what's the plan?</i>

59:38.192 --> 59:40.956
<i>We can't just go breaking
into Vice Principal Grimes' house.</i>

59:41.129 --> 59:43.154
Then he really could have us arrested.

59:43.331 --> 59:46.960
<i>lt's not breaking in
if the front door's wide open.</i>

59:47.902 --> 59:48.960
Come on.

59:50.838 --> 59:53.170
Guys, l think we should
reconsider this.

59:53.341 --> 59:56.208
Hey, wait for me.

01:00:12.827 --> 01:00:14.522
Guys, it just a dummy.

01:00:21.702 --> 01:00:26.002
Looks like Vice Principal Grimes
is quite the World War ll buff.

01:00:27.542 --> 01:00:30.272
<i>All right, gang,
l'm just throwing this out there...</i>

01:00:30.444 --> 01:00:32.275
...not trying to boss anyone around.

01:00:32.446 --> 01:00:36.542
But you think it might be a good idea
if we split up and search for clues?

01:00:36.984 --> 01:00:38.212
<i>l'm just saying.</i>

01:00:38.386 --> 01:00:40.854
Well, mathematically,
the odds of finding anything...

01:00:41.022 --> 01:00:43.582
-...would increase if we were divided.
-Exactly.

01:00:43.758 --> 01:00:45.453
-Works for me.
-Great.

01:00:45.626 --> 01:00:47.423
<i>Velma, Daphne, we'll check upstairs.</i>

01:00:47.595 --> 01:00:49.790
Shaggy, Scooby,
you guys looks around down here.

01:00:49.964 --> 01:00:52.159
Look for that book
and anything else suspicious.

01:00:52.333 --> 01:00:53.732
Yep.

01:01:00.007 --> 01:01:01.702
Like, look at this.

01:01:06.581 --> 01:01:08.879
<i>Come on, Scoob. Let's see if it works.</i>

01:01:09.050 --> 01:01:10.449
Aye, aye, captain.

01:01:16.524 --> 01:01:18.549
Fresh as a daisy.

01:01:22.096 --> 01:01:25.623
<i>Oh, Scoob.
Oh, come on, let's get to work.</i>

01:01:28.269 --> 01:01:31.830
<i>''Discipline 1 01, '' ''Getting in Touch
with your Inner Disciplinarian ''...</i>

01:01:32.006 --> 01:01:35.498
<i>... ''The Complete Disciplinarian's Guide
to Discipline. ''</i>

01:01:36.377 --> 01:01:37.901
<i>Tuesdays With Morrie.</i>

01:01:50.725 --> 01:01:52.317
Books.

01:01:55.129 --> 01:01:56.460
Oh, Scoob...

01:01:56.631 --> 01:01:59.498
<i>...quit crowding me.
You're breathing right down my neck, man.</i>

01:01:59.667 --> 01:02:02.830
<i>-l am?
-Like, if that's not your breath--</i>

01:02:04.705 --> 01:02:06.195
Zoinks!

01:02:38.706 --> 01:02:41.334
Jinkies. Look.

01:02:45.579 --> 01:02:49.037
Looks like we were right about Grimes.
We have the evidence we need.

01:02:49.216 --> 01:02:50.240
...to clear our names.

01:02:50.418 --> 01:02:54.184
And if we can find the right spell,
we can break his control of the ghosts.

01:02:54.355 --> 01:02:57.916
<i>But we still don't know
why Grimes is doing any of this.</i>

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:00.525
Wait a second.

01:03:00.695 --> 01:03:02.356
Maybe we do, Freddie.

01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:06.330
<i>-What is it?
-Looks like some of Grimes' research.</i>

01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:07.660
And look.

01:03:08.336 --> 01:03:09.496
Time capsule?

01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:12.332
<i>lt's gotta be what he's after. Remember?</i>

01:03:12.506 --> 01:03:15.873
<i>They were going to bury it
on the school's opening day...</i>

01:03:16.043 --> 01:03:18.102
<i>-...but they never did.
-That's right.</i>

01:03:18.279 --> 01:03:20.543
-Because of the Coolsville Flood.
-Exactly.

01:03:20.715 --> 01:03:25.345
So that means that the time capsule
is still inside the old school.

01:03:25.519 --> 01:03:28.352
Which is buried 200 feet
under the new school.

01:03:30.391 --> 01:03:32.757
We did it. We solved the mystery.

01:03:33.761 --> 01:03:37.128
<i>-Hey, guys, we gotta get out of here.
-Shaggy, what's wrong?</i>

01:03:38.566 --> 01:03:40.090
That!

01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:47.466
Jinkies!

01:03:51.479 --> 01:03:54.414
Scooby-Doo, where are you?

01:03:54.582 --> 01:03:57.551
<i>Here, l'm coming.</i>

01:04:01.122 --> 01:04:05.081
<i>Foolish children.
You've fallen right into my trap.</i>

01:04:06.427 --> 01:04:08.657
l just remembered...

01:04:08.829 --> 01:04:11.059
...magnesium chlorate has sulfur.

01:04:11.632 --> 01:04:13.156
Sulfur...

01:04:13.334 --> 01:04:14.995
...makes you sleepy.

01:04:15.169 --> 01:04:18.900
Sweet dreams, kiddies.

01:04:26.127 --> 01:04:28.561
Daphne, are you okay?

01:04:28.729 --> 01:04:30.219
Where are we?

01:04:30.397 --> 01:04:32.194
Looks like the gym.

01:04:32.366 --> 01:04:33.856
How did we get here?

01:04:34.034 --> 01:04:38.164
<i>l don't know. l can't remember
anything after that green spray.</i>

01:04:40.307 --> 01:04:43.174
Bet you this is the work
of that phony specter.

01:04:43.344 --> 01:04:45.005
Bravo.

01:04:45.179 --> 01:04:49.513
Bravo, little puzzle masters.
You put all the pieces together.

01:04:49.683 --> 01:04:53.744
<i>The time capsule,
it's all about the time capsule.</i>

01:04:53.921 --> 01:04:58.153
But thanks to you, l can retrieve it
without even getting my hands dirty.

01:04:58.325 --> 01:04:59.986
<i>lronic, isn't it?</i>

01:05:00.161 --> 01:05:02.959
All you were trying to do
is clear your names...

01:05:03.130 --> 01:05:06.896
...but all you did
was get yourselves in deeper.

01:05:07.067 --> 01:05:10.264
Now, get down there
and find me that time capsule.

01:05:10.437 --> 01:05:14.032
<i>-Like, we'd ever help you.
-Fine. But if you don't...</i>

01:05:14.208 --> 01:05:16.676
<i>...you'll never see
your little puppy dog again.</i>

01:05:18.579 --> 01:05:20.012
Scooby?

01:05:20.581 --> 01:05:22.913
<i>You'll never get away,
Vice Principal Grimes.</i>

01:05:23.083 --> 01:05:24.107
Grimes?

01:05:25.519 --> 01:05:28.784
That was the one piece of the puzzle
you never managed to put into place.

01:05:33.093 --> 01:05:37.223
Ghosts. Get these two out of my sight.

01:05:39.366 --> 01:05:41.732
Help, Shaggy.

01:05:41.902 --> 01:05:43.426
-Help.
-Scooby-Doo.

01:05:43.604 --> 01:05:45.094
Just remember...

01:05:45.272 --> 01:05:47.263
<i>...dogs don't have nine lives.</i>

01:05:57.184 --> 01:05:59.084
What are we gonna do?

01:05:59.253 --> 01:06:00.447
<i>l don't know.</i>

01:06:00.621 --> 01:06:02.384
lf we actually do what he wants...

01:06:02.556 --> 01:06:05.957
...being expelled would be the least
of our worries.

01:06:07.661 --> 01:06:09.219
Shaggy, what are you doing?

01:06:10.297 --> 01:06:13.460
<i>Scooby-Doo's my dog
and l'd do anything to save him.</i>

01:06:15.369 --> 01:06:18.770
<i>He's right, guys.
And Scooby's not just his dog.</i>

01:06:18.939 --> 01:06:20.566
<i>l feel like he's my dog too.</i>

01:06:26.313 --> 01:06:27.473
l have to admit...

01:06:27.648 --> 01:06:30.116
<i>...he's really grown on me too.</i>

01:06:34.188 --> 01:06:36.247
Oh, jinkies.

01:06:36.857 --> 01:06:38.848
<i>He's sloppy, he smells...</i>

01:06:39.026 --> 01:06:41.324
<i>...and l'm really more of a cat person...</i>

01:06:41.495 --> 01:06:44.362
<i>...but he's still the cutest dog
l've ever seen.</i>

01:06:44.531 --> 01:06:47.659
What do you say, gang?
Do it for Scooby-Doo?

01:06:49.136 --> 01:06:50.899
For Scooby!

01:07:04.184 --> 01:07:05.674
Kind of musty down here.

01:07:05.853 --> 01:07:08.981
<i>l sure hope my allergies
don't start acting up.</i>

01:07:13.327 --> 01:07:14.919
Oh, Shaggy.

01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:24.530
So long Coolsville,
welcome to Creepsville.

01:07:24.705 --> 01:07:27.333
Like, l guess this is what they mean
by a fixer-upper.

01:07:27.508 --> 01:07:31.171
No one has fixed this place up
since the turn of the century.

01:07:31.345 --> 01:07:35.281
Well, l guess we better start looking
for the time capsule.

01:07:35.449 --> 01:07:37.815
-Come on, this way.
-Yeah.

01:07:51.865 --> 01:07:56.359
Yuck. Now l know why he wanted us
to come down here.

01:07:57.304 --> 01:07:59.966
Oh, so like, if the time capsule
was never buried...

01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:03.803
<i>-...then where would it be?
-l don't know.</i>

01:08:03.977 --> 01:08:07.174
l guess we just have to search
until we find it.

01:08:08.248 --> 01:08:10.011
<i>What's this?</i>

01:08:12.319 --> 01:08:14.583
-Come on.
-All right, let me try.

01:08:14.755 --> 01:08:17.189
<i>l'm good with these kinds of things.</i>

01:08:24.231 --> 01:08:25.858
See?

01:08:29.502 --> 01:08:30.993
Jinkies!

01:08:31.171 --> 01:08:32.263
- Get back!
-Velma!

01:08:37.111 --> 01:08:38.237
Are you okay?

01:08:38.845 --> 01:08:40.939
Never better.

01:08:43.450 --> 01:08:47.443
<i>Hi. Don't mind us,
but Scooby-Doo? Remember?</i>

01:08:51.024 --> 01:08:54.720
<i>l don't know about you, but l don't know
how many doors l wanna be opening here.</i>

01:08:54.895 --> 01:08:55.919
Yeah.

01:08:56.095 --> 01:08:57.461
And you know what...

01:08:57.631 --> 01:09:00.997
...even if we do manage
to find the time capsule...

01:09:01.167 --> 01:09:04.535
...he still can pin the whole thing on us.

01:09:04.738 --> 01:09:08.504
Maybe not. l have a plan. Huddle up.

01:09:13.781 --> 01:09:17.113
Excuse me, Mr. Creepy Dude, sir?

01:09:17.584 --> 01:09:19.245
May we have a word with you?

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:21.381
Just a quick--

01:09:21.555 --> 01:09:22.680
Yeah, hello?

01:09:22.856 --> 01:09:26.917
-Hello?
-What? What is it?

01:09:27.461 --> 01:09:29.554
l think we found it.

01:09:29.729 --> 01:09:32.528
<i>-But the problem is--
-lt's really heavy.</i>

01:09:32.698 --> 01:09:35.600
<i>Yeah, and we're gonna--</i>

01:09:35.769 --> 01:09:37.964
-Need some help.
-Yeah.

01:09:38.604 --> 01:09:43.633
<i> lt's just like they always say,
never work with children or animals.</i>

01:09:52.051 --> 01:09:54.247
Well, all right.

01:09:54.421 --> 01:09:56.412
Where is it?

01:09:56.890 --> 01:10:00.348
-Hey, where are you kids?
-All aboard.

01:10:00.527 --> 01:10:01.653
Whoa!

01:10:03.130 --> 01:10:06.031
<i>Here's for trying to frame us.
-l'll take that.</i>

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:08.725
Please keep your arms and legs
inside the vehicle.

01:10:08.902 --> 01:10:11.735
 Now, you just wait in here
until the authorities arrive.

01:10:17.377 --> 01:10:18.571
Huh?

01:10:24.785 --> 01:10:28.414
The time capsule. Mine at last.

01:10:30.858 --> 01:10:35.158
Thanks, kids.
l really appreciate your help.

01:10:35.329 --> 01:10:37.229
How can l ever thank you?

01:10:37.397 --> 01:10:41.527
Oh, l know.
How about by burying you alive?

01:10:41.702 --> 01:10:42.726
Run!

01:10:45.272 --> 01:10:48.207
<i>This isn't the teacher's lounge.
After them.</i>

01:10:50.511 --> 01:10:53.275
Do l have to think of everything
around here?

01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:02.384
Velma, we need a spell
to get rid of these ghosts.

01:11:02.556 --> 01:11:04.888
<i>l'm on it. l'm on it.</i>

01:11:05.726 --> 01:11:07.091
My glasses.

01:11:09.596 --> 01:11:11.325
-Sorry.
-Great.

01:11:11.498 --> 01:11:13.227
<i>You're gonna have to find a spell.</i>

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:16.528
-Come on!
-Wait for me.

01:11:19.072 --> 01:11:21.040
Okay, gang, in here.

01:11:22.809 --> 01:11:24.367
<i>All right. l think we're safe.</i>

01:11:44.097 --> 01:11:45.462
Go!

01:11:49.770 --> 01:11:51.965
-Oh. no. Spiders!
-Spiders.

01:11:52.139 --> 01:11:53.936
Shaggy, come on.

01:12:00.847 --> 01:12:02.940
-Shaggy!
-Okay.

01:12:03.116 --> 01:12:04.310
Okay, l think l got one.

01:12:11.725 --> 01:12:13.886
Oh, man.

01:12:16.763 --> 01:12:19.254
Shaggy, wrong spell!

01:12:20.367 --> 01:12:21.994
Go!

01:12:31.578 --> 01:12:33.842
<i>See the world in wax, improve your mind.</i>

01:12:34.014 --> 01:12:38.110
<i>See the chamber of horrors
and scare yourself out of a year's growth.</i>

01:13:09.416 --> 01:13:13.318
-Anyone for chicken cordon boo?
-Oh!

01:13:16.289 --> 01:13:21.056
Aha! There you are.
Where did you kids run off to?

01:13:21.228 --> 01:13:24.857
-Shaggy, we need a new spell.
-Will do. All right, all right, hold on.

01:13:25.032 --> 01:13:27.000
<i>The fun's over. Get them!</i>

01:13:46.153 --> 01:13:49.782
<i> We're sorry.
-We were under his control.</i>

01:14:01.635 --> 01:14:03.569
We did it.

01:14:05.305 --> 01:14:10.106
<i>You think that changes anything?
l'm still the only one getting out of here.</i>

01:14:32.699 --> 01:14:34.098
Great job, Scoob.

01:14:34.768 --> 01:14:36.429
<i>That's my boy.</i>

01:14:36.603 --> 01:14:41.302
<i>-Now, let's see who this clown really is.
-No, no, no.</i>

01:14:41.475 --> 01:14:43.238
Principal Deedle?

01:14:43.410 --> 01:14:45.139
You ruined everything.

01:14:45.846 --> 01:14:50.010
l was so close.
The time capsule was in my hands.

01:14:50.183 --> 01:14:52.117
<i>This doesn't make any sense.</i>

01:14:52.319 --> 01:14:55.288
<i>What could be in the time capsule
that's so valuable...</i>

01:14:55.455 --> 01:14:57.650
...a principal would wanna close
his own school?

01:14:57.824 --> 01:14:59.587
Only one way to find out.

01:15:05.599 --> 01:15:09.035
<i>lt's just a bunch of old letters
and papers and stuff.</i>

01:15:09.202 --> 01:15:13.764
Not just letters. Letters with stamps.
And look at this one.

01:15:14.407 --> 01:15:18.867
<i>-lt's a misprint.
-Yes. The Eerie stamp.</i>

01:15:19.045 --> 01:15:22.014
The most valuable misprint
in the entire world.

01:15:22.783 --> 01:15:25.343
lt would have been all mine...

01:15:25.519 --> 01:15:28.488
<i>...if it weren't for you meddling kids
and your dog.</i>

01:15:28.655 --> 01:15:30.145
<i>That's me.</i>

01:15:32.526 --> 01:15:34.721
Scooby-Doo.

01:15:35.562 --> 01:15:38.156
Scoob, Scoob, come on, buddy.
Come on.

01:15:38.331 --> 01:15:41.630
l know. l love you too, boy.
l love you too. l know.

01:15:41.902 --> 01:15:43.927
<i>We solved the mystery. lt's okay.
l understand.</i>

01:15:44.104 --> 01:15:50.009
And that is why all of Coolsville
owes these students a debt of gratitude.

01:15:58.285 --> 01:16:01.914
And l want to personally apologize
for wrongly accusing you.

01:16:02.088 --> 01:16:06.548
l just-- l just love this school so much.

01:16:06.726 --> 01:16:10.662
So tell us, kids.
How did you solve the mystery?

01:16:11.665 --> 01:16:15.260
<i>Well, it was a combination
of Fred's leadership.</i>

01:16:15.502 --> 01:16:17.163
<i>And Velma's brains.</i>

01:16:17.337 --> 01:16:19.271
<i>Daphne's resourcefulness.</i>

01:16:19.439 --> 01:16:22.135
And the most important ingredient
of all...

01:16:22.309 --> 01:16:23.333
...our friendship.

01:16:23.810 --> 01:16:25.175
Thank you.

01:16:25.345 --> 01:16:28.041
That was beautiful, Shaggy.

01:16:28.215 --> 01:16:30.479
And now, to mark the occasion...

01:16:30.650 --> 01:16:36.054
...we are going to officially bury
the Coolsville Academy time capsule.

01:16:53.406 --> 01:16:54.532
Zoinks.

01:16:54.708 --> 01:16:56.073
Sorry.

01:16:57.177 --> 01:16:59.270
Accidents happen.

01:17:06.286 --> 01:17:09.449
<i>l can't believe it.
We solved an actual mystery.</i>

01:17:09.623 --> 01:17:10.749
l have to admit...

01:17:10.924 --> 01:17:14.621
<i>...it's much more satisfying solving them
than it is reading about them.</i>

01:17:14.794 --> 01:17:19.094
Yeah, and this way,
no one can ruin the ending for you.

01:17:19.799 --> 01:17:21.494
Sorry.

01:17:21.968 --> 01:17:24.129
So, like, what do we do now?

01:17:31.378 --> 01:17:33.107
<i>l don't know.</i>

01:17:34.047 --> 01:17:36.481
<i>-l guess we'll see each other on the bus.
-Yeah.</i>

01:17:36.650 --> 01:17:38.277
-Yeah.
-The bus.

01:17:38.451 --> 01:17:40.112
Okay.

01:17:40.987 --> 01:17:42.147
<i>Hey, l'll see you around.</i>

01:17:42.322 --> 01:17:44.085
<i>-l'll see you around.
-Okay.</i>

01:17:44.557 --> 01:17:46.115
Okay? Okay.

01:17:47.127 --> 01:17:48.594
Bye.

01:17:48.762 --> 01:17:50.491
Come on, Scoob.

01:17:54.034 --> 01:17:56.525
Actually, wait. Hold on.

01:17:58.939 --> 01:18:02.136
<i>l hear there's been some strange goings-on
at the Coolsville Museum.</i>

01:18:03.109 --> 01:18:06.510
<i>-Anyone feel like checking it out?
-Sounds like another mystery. l'm in.</i>

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:07.840
Count me in too.

01:18:08.014 --> 01:18:10.710
<i>-What do you say, guys?
-Hey, l'd go anywhere with you all.</i>

01:18:10.884 --> 01:18:13.546
-How about it, Scoob?
-No way.

01:18:15.255 --> 01:18:18.156
Well, would you do it
for a Scooby Snack?

01:18:18.325 --> 01:18:20.156
-Scooby snack?
-Yeah.

01:18:20.327 --> 01:18:23.057
<i>l figure you love these so much,
l'd name them after you.</i>

01:18:25.732 --> 01:18:28.257
<i>-l'm in.
-Glad you're on board, Scoob.</i>

01:18:28.435 --> 01:18:32.895
<i>-lt wouldn't be the same without you.
-Scooby-Dooby-Doo.</i>

01:18:33.673 --> 01:18:36.005
<i>All right, come on, gang. Let's go.</i>
