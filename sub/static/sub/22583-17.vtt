00:04.085 --> 00:05.882
Previously on Enterprise:

00:06.605 --> 00:08.163
The Insectoid ship's been damaged.

00:08.285 --> 00:09.400
Target the second one.

00:12.605 --> 00:15.677
Is that what this is all about?
You think I want to replace you?

00:15.805 --> 00:18.558
You just can't stand
taking orders from me, can you?

00:22.485 --> 00:24.157
- Tell me something.
- What?

00:24.285 --> 00:26.196
Why won't you let me do my job?

00:27.965 --> 00:30.081
I want to know
where you're building the weapon.

00:30.205 --> 00:32.958
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- The hell you don't.

00:33.085 --> 00:35.519
There's a reference
to a planet he visited recently.

00:35.645 --> 00:37.203
Azati Prime.

00:37.325 --> 00:40.123
The coordinates match
the location of one of the red giants.

00:40.245 --> 00:43.203
Set a course for Azati Prime,
maximum warp.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:55.445 --> 00:56.514
Magnify.

00:59.445 --> 01:01.163
It's definitely Xindi, sir.

01:01.285 --> 01:04.322
The hull composition matches
the other ships we've seen.

01:04.644 --> 01:07.557
It doesn't look like a Reptilian
or a Primate design.

01:07.885 --> 01:08.954
Bio-signs?

01:09.085 --> 01:12.395
None that I can detect.
There's no atmosphere aboard.

01:15.045 --> 01:17.479
- Anyone else in the system?
- No, sir.

01:20.245 --> 01:22.156
- Put a team together.
- Aye, sir.

01:27.165 --> 01:29.725
It's been a long road

01:32.365 --> 01:34.356
Gettin' from there to here

01:34.485 --> 01:37.283
It's been a long time

01:38.165 --> 01:41.635
But my time is finally near

01:42.045 --> 01:45.435
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

01:46.205 --> 01:49.038
I will touch the sky

01:49.445 --> 01:52.994
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

01:53.125 --> 01:56.037
No, they're not gonna change my mind

01:56.165 --> 02:00.443
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

02:00.765 --> 02:03.598
I'm going where my heart will take me

02:03.725 --> 02:07.877
I've got faith to believe

02:08.324 --> 02:10.919
I can do anything

02:11.044 --> 02:14.754
I've got strength of the soul

02:15.565 --> 02:18.318
And no one's gonna bend or break me

02:18.445 --> 02:22.643
I can reach any star

02:23.965 --> 02:25.956
I've got faith

02:27.645 --> 02:30.762
I've got faith

02:31.325 --> 02:34.601
Faith of the heart

03:35.085 --> 03:37.155
We'll take them back to Enterprise.

03:37.725 --> 03:39.920
Tell Phlox I want a complete autopsy.

03:40.725 --> 03:42.795
The Major and I will search
the port side.

03:43.005 --> 03:45.041
See if you can access
their ship's database.

04:47.645 --> 04:49.203
It's a computer interface.

04:49.325 --> 04:50.997
See what you can download.

04:54.965 --> 04:57.684
My father would love to get a look
at this place.

04:58.525 --> 05:00.641
He's fascinated by insects.

05:00.765 --> 05:03.598
Always filling the house up with bugs
he's collected.

05:03.725 --> 05:05.283
Drives my mother crazy.

05:06.165 --> 05:09.282
Maybe we can bring home
something new for his collection.

05:13.125 --> 05:15.081
It's heavily reinforced.

05:36.845 --> 05:38.198
It's pressurising.

05:40.085 --> 05:41.962
Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere.

05:43.405 --> 05:44.633
After you.

05:49.685 --> 05:52.279
A little stale, but breathable.

05:53.285 --> 05:54.400
Bio-signs...

05:55.485 --> 05:56.554
very faint.

05:57.365 --> 05:58.798
Coming from in here.

06:08.805 --> 06:10.477
Some kind of shuttlecraft?

06:10.885 --> 06:12.716
More like an assault vehicle.

06:13.765 --> 06:17.758
I'm reading a half-dozen
particle-cannons, torpedo launchers.

06:20.845 --> 06:21.914
Archer.

06:22.045 --> 06:24.001
You'd better get over here, sir.

06:49.085 --> 06:51.645
The DNA is identical
to the bodies we found.

06:52.285 --> 06:55.163
They would appear to be
the crew's offspring.

06:57.965 --> 06:59.114
A hatchery?

06:59.245 --> 07:01.475
They built this place to take
quite a beating.

07:01.605 --> 07:04.358
Reinforced bulkheads,
backup power systems.

07:04.725 --> 07:06.841
Thirty-one eggs are still viable.

07:06.965 --> 07:09.798
They won't survive for long.
Their bio-support is losing power.

07:09.925 --> 07:11.756
Do you think you can repair it?

07:11.965 --> 07:14.081
I wouldn't even know where to start.

07:16.005 --> 07:19.077
There's a shuttlecraft in their port bay,
get it back to the ship.

07:19.205 --> 07:22.197
I want an analysis of their
tactical systems as soon as possible.

07:22.325 --> 07:23.724
Aye, sir.

07:37.405 --> 07:38.884
Did you find their Bridge?

07:39.005 --> 07:40.723
I'm not certain there is one.

07:40.845 --> 07:44.042
Their command functions appear to be
distributed through various...

07:44.165 --> 07:45.484
Captain!

07:48.765 --> 07:50.039
I'm all right.

07:50.525 --> 07:52.356
We should get you to Sickbay.

08:04.365 --> 08:07.835
A mild neurotoxin, likely part
of an autonomic defence system.

08:07.965 --> 08:10.433
The egg probably considered you
a threat.

08:10.565 --> 08:13.033
Humans seem to have that effect
on the Xindi.

08:13.765 --> 08:16.598
An analgesic should take care
of the irritation.

08:18.565 --> 08:20.999
Malcolm's bringing you
two dead Insectoids.

08:21.485 --> 08:23.715
I want you to learn
as much as you can about them.

08:23.845 --> 08:25.164
Understood.

08:26.885 --> 08:28.364
We've located their Armoury.

08:28.485 --> 08:31.318
Found several particle weapons
and torpedo casings.

08:31.485 --> 08:32.918
What about the data you recovered?

08:33.044 --> 08:34.558
Ensign Sato's translating it.

08:34.684 --> 08:38.313
We'll be ready to leave orbit
as soon as the Xindi shuttle's aboard.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.436
We've cleared the thermosphere.

08:47.645 --> 08:50.682
You might want to do a better job
securing our guests.

08:54.845 --> 08:57.075
I think it's safe to assume it's dead.

08:57.205 --> 08:58.638
Just being cautious.

09:02.885 --> 09:05.558
Certain insects on Earth
are known to hibernate.

09:17.005 --> 09:18.882
Do you intend to shoot me, Major?

09:19.005 --> 09:20.916
It's not you I'm worried about.

09:22.605 --> 09:25.563
I've been going over the results
from the last training session.

09:25.685 --> 09:28.119
Your senior officers have shown
a lot of improvement...

09:28.245 --> 09:30.634
but I think they can do better.
With your permission...

09:30.765 --> 09:33.598
I'd like to schedule more
target practice for Monday evening.

09:33.725 --> 09:36.285
That won't go over well
with Commander Tucker.

09:36.605 --> 09:38.675
Monday night is movie night.

09:40.765 --> 09:44.519
Maybe he can sacrifice some
leisure time for the sake of this mission.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.674
The senior officers
do have other duties.

09:48.405 --> 09:52.114
We can't all spend our time playing
holographic games in the Armoury.

09:52.565 --> 09:55.284
I'm not sure that's how the Captain
would see it.

09:55.605 --> 09:58.597
Enterprise to Shuttlepod 2.
You're clear to approach.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.598
Acknowledged. Deploy the docking arm.

10:03.725 --> 10:04.840
Come in.

10:06.605 --> 10:08.561
I think we figured out
what happened to them.

10:08.685 --> 10:12.360
One of the nacelles fractured while they
were coming out of a subspace vortex.

10:12.485 --> 10:15.921
They probably tried to make
an emergency landing on this planet.

10:17.845 --> 10:21.235
According to Phlox, the Insectoids
we found weren't killed in the crash...

10:21.365 --> 10:22.354
they suffocated?

10:22.485 --> 10:25.318
Most of the crew appear to have died
when they transferred...

10:25.445 --> 10:27.515
their life support to the hatchery.

10:28.165 --> 10:30.918
They sacrificed themselves
to save their children.

10:33.005 --> 10:35.439
You said the hatchery
is losing bio-support.

10:35.725 --> 10:37.238
How long will it last?

10:37.765 --> 10:39.245
Another day, at most.

10:40.125 --> 10:42.514
I want you to assign a team to repair it.

10:43.165 --> 10:45.076
- Captain?
- What about Azati Prime?

10:45.205 --> 10:47.799
It's not going anywhere.
This is a sentient species.

10:47.925 --> 10:49.153
We can't abandon them.

10:49.285 --> 10:51.879
Captain, with all due respect,
why the hell not?

10:52.005 --> 10:55.156
I've got half a mind
to take a plasma torch to that place.

10:55.325 --> 10:59.477
What if we found a nursery
filled with 31 infant Primates?

10:59.845 --> 11:01.642
Would you want to torch them?

11:01.765 --> 11:03.517
The Xindi are trying to destroy Earth...

11:03.645 --> 11:05.795
because they heard
that humans are ruthless.

11:05.925 --> 11:07.961
This is a chance to prove them wrong.

11:08.085 --> 11:11.077
We can bring the eggs aboard.
Reconfigure one of the cargo bays.

11:11.205 --> 11:12.479
I already talked to Phlox.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.880
He says they're integrated
into the hatchery walls.

11:15.005 --> 11:16.484
If we remove them, they'll die.

11:16.605 --> 11:19.756
Sir, this is crazy.
These people are trying to kill us.

11:19.885 --> 11:21.796
This isn't open for discussion.

11:22.245 --> 11:24.156
I'll lead the engineering team.

11:24.485 --> 11:28.637
I need you here to help Travis figure out
how to operate that Xindi shuttle.

11:28.765 --> 11:30.960
- Captain.
- I've made my decision.

11:32.805 --> 11:33.954
Get to work.

11:46.805 --> 11:50.002
Captain's Starlog, January 8, 2154.

11:50.645 --> 11:52.795
We've been in orbit for more than a day.

11:52.925 --> 11:55.439
The crew is restless,
eager to resume our mission.

11:55.565 --> 11:58.318
But I'm certain my decision to stay
was the right one.

11:58.445 --> 12:01.960
They may know how to build a weapon
system, but these people could learn...

12:02.125 --> 12:04.878
a thing or two about designing
a comfortable chair.

12:05.005 --> 12:07.519
For an Insectoid,
maybe they are comfortable.

12:08.045 --> 12:10.275
The power grid
doesn't make much sense.

12:10.405 --> 12:13.078
Almost half of it is routed
to structural integrity.

12:13.205 --> 12:16.117
You could probably fly this thing
inside a gas giant.

12:16.525 --> 12:18.993
Assuming you could figure out
how to fly it.

12:19.205 --> 12:22.561
This icon looks like it might represent
the impulse manifolds.

12:22.965 --> 12:24.318
Give it a shot.

12:28.605 --> 12:31.039
I don't think this ship likes us
very much.

12:33.205 --> 12:36.515
You're going to have to remove
the relays here and here.

12:36.645 --> 12:38.476
That should disable
the security protocols.

12:38.605 --> 12:40.880
We can't initialise the engines
without them.

12:41.005 --> 12:42.563
What about the ship on the surface?

12:42.685 --> 12:44.516
We might be able to salvage
what we need.

12:44.645 --> 12:45.794
Yeah.

12:46.765 --> 12:49.563
Any word on how much longer
he's planning to stay in orbit?

12:49.685 --> 12:51.482
The repairs are moving slow.

12:52.165 --> 12:54.440
I'd be the last to question
the Captain's orders...

12:54.565 --> 12:57.204
but doesn't it seem a little odd
that we're staying here...

12:57.325 --> 12:59.122
to save a nest of Xindi?

12:59.245 --> 13:01.281
The Captain thinks
it's the right thing to do.

13:01.405 --> 13:04.283
We may be at war,
but these creatures need our help.

13:04.485 --> 13:07.204
Meanwhile, their big brothers
are trying to destroy Earth.

13:07.325 --> 13:10.442
Every day we stay here gives them
more time to finish their weapon.

13:10.565 --> 13:11.759
Look...

13:13.245 --> 13:17.284
there's a chance we'll run into more
Insectoids when we reach the red giant.

13:17.445 --> 13:21.563
Spending an extra day or two studying
their tactical systems might be useful.

13:27.485 --> 13:28.554
Captain.

13:29.525 --> 13:32.756
I've learned quite a bit
about this fascinating fellow.

13:33.325 --> 13:37.364
Perhaps "fellow" is the wrong word,
their species is genderless.

13:38.405 --> 13:39.963
Then who made all those eggs?

13:40.085 --> 13:41.837
They reproduce asexually.

13:42.445 --> 13:45.676
Each adult appears capable
of producing multiple egg sacs.

13:45.805 --> 13:49.593
I wouldn't be surprised if every
Insectoid vessel had its own hatchery.

13:50.405 --> 13:55.081
I'd estimate their lifespan
is no more than 12 Earth years.

13:55.205 --> 13:57.958
This individual may be
one of the elder members of the crew.

13:58.085 --> 13:59.757
It was nearly 10 years old.

13:59.885 --> 14:01.477
What about the hatchery?

14:01.645 --> 14:03.317
When will the eggs mature?

14:03.565 --> 14:07.160
Without knowing more about their
incubation cycle, it's impossible to say...

14:07.285 --> 14:10.561
but probably no more than a week,
at most.

14:13.565 --> 14:18.081
Captain, if you don't mind my saying,
you look as if you could use some rest.

14:18.205 --> 14:20.116
We've got to get the repairs finished.

14:20.245 --> 14:21.837
Surely a few hours' sleep wouldn't...

14:21.965 --> 14:24.160
Contact me if you find anything else.

14:56.165 --> 14:58.360
- Is there a problem, Corporal?
- No, ma'am.

14:58.485 --> 15:01.443
- Why are you guarding this chamber?
- Captain's orders.

15:23.205 --> 15:25.924
- Lieutenant Reed's report.
- What?

15:26.045 --> 15:29.082
You requested a tactical analysis
of the Insectoid ship.

15:29.485 --> 15:30.759
Later.

15:32.645 --> 15:35.113
- Are we ready?
- Just a few seconds, Captain.

15:36.965 --> 15:38.603
There are two MACOs posted outside.

15:38.725 --> 15:41.956
I asked Major Hayes to assign them.
These eggs are vulnerable.

15:42.085 --> 15:44.280
There are breaches in the outer hull.

15:44.645 --> 15:46.601
There could be predators around.

15:47.245 --> 15:50.555
Aside from microbes, we found
no evidence of life on this planet.

15:50.685 --> 15:52.880
- Trip.
- We're ready.

15:53.765 --> 15:57.394
Start at 40 megajoules, but keep an eye
on that matrix converter.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.558
Take it up to 50.

16:08.965 --> 16:09.954
Trip?

16:14.205 --> 16:15.354
Shut it down.

16:19.285 --> 16:20.434
What happened?

16:21.125 --> 16:23.719
There must have been a surge
in the power grid.

16:24.285 --> 16:26.321
I'll need a few minutes, Captain.

16:34.845 --> 16:36.324
Archer to Enterprise.

16:37.605 --> 16:38.958
Medical emergency.

16:51.565 --> 16:53.999
There was nothing I could do. I'm sorry.

17:00.365 --> 17:02.720
How's Hoshi coming
with that translation?

17:02.845 --> 17:06.121
Their iconography is different
from the other Xindi species.

17:06.325 --> 17:07.838
It's taking some time.

17:08.125 --> 17:12.003
When she's done,
ask her to search their database.

17:12.125 --> 17:15.276
See if she can locate anything
about their burial rituals.

17:16.605 --> 17:18.482
Do you plan to hold a funeral?

17:19.565 --> 17:21.203
Tucker to Captain Archer.

17:23.405 --> 17:24.554
Go ahead.

17:24.685 --> 17:26.164
I think I figured out the problem.

17:26.285 --> 17:28.241
Their power grid can't handle
our converters.

17:28.365 --> 17:30.799
It's going to take at least three days
to make them compatible.

17:30.925 --> 17:33.155
What about the reactor?
Any way to bring it online?

17:33.285 --> 17:36.880
It's possible, but they lost most of their
antimatter in the accident.

17:37.125 --> 17:38.399
Stand by.

17:41.285 --> 17:42.479
Work with Trip.

17:42.765 --> 17:43.914
Help him get their reactor
up and running.

17:44.045 --> 17:45.080
Sir?

17:45.205 --> 17:47.799
We're going to transfer our antimatter
to their ship.

17:47.925 --> 17:49.119
Use as much as you have to.

17:49.245 --> 17:51.201
Our reserves are at less than 60%...

17:51.325 --> 17:53.714
I'm not going to let
any more of them die.

18:08.525 --> 18:11.881
To get that reactor running again,
we're going to have to use a third...

18:12.005 --> 18:13.324
of our antimatter reserves.

18:13.445 --> 18:14.594
Why so much?

18:14.725 --> 18:16.602
Every system on that ship is integrated.

18:16.725 --> 18:20.354
The only way to bring bio-support back
online is to power up the whole thing.

18:20.485 --> 18:23.318
That's not going to leave much
antimatter for our torpedoes...

18:23.445 --> 18:24.480
never mind our engines.

18:24.605 --> 18:26.277
Did you inform the Captain?

18:26.405 --> 18:28.760
I wanted to run it by both of you first.

18:29.845 --> 18:33.394
I never imagined Captain Archer
would put the welfare of a few Xindi...

18:33.525 --> 18:35.197
before his own people.

18:35.685 --> 18:38.199
Do you know he's spent nearly two days
in that hatchery?

18:38.325 --> 18:41.085
From what I'm told, he hasn't stopped
working long enough to even sleep.

18:41.085 --> 18:42.154
From what I'm told, he hasn't stopped
working long enough to even sleep.

18:43.685 --> 18:45.403
Delay the transfer for now.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.956
The Captain gave us an order.

18:49.005 --> 18:50.438
I'll speak with him.

19:04.165 --> 19:05.280
Where's Trip?

19:05.405 --> 19:07.965
- Did you bring the antimatter?
- No.

19:09.165 --> 19:10.314
What's the problem?

19:10.445 --> 19:13.596
Initialising their reactor
will deplete our reserves by one-third.

19:13.725 --> 19:15.124
We can spare it.

19:15.245 --> 19:17.679
We're only a few light-years
from the red giant.

19:17.805 --> 19:20.114
We'll still have more than enough fuel
to get there.

19:20.245 --> 19:23.442
We don't know for certain
if the weapon is in that system.

19:25.925 --> 19:27.756
There are lives at risk here.

19:28.085 --> 19:31.555
Billions of lives are at risk on Earth
if our mission fails.

19:31.685 --> 19:33.243
I'm well aware of that.

19:36.325 --> 19:38.759
These Xindi are innocent.

19:39.605 --> 19:43.803
If we let them die, we'll be proving
to the others that they're right about us.

19:45.005 --> 19:48.395
I don't know much about Vulcan ethics,
but humans don't throw morality...

19:48.525 --> 19:50.959
out the window
when things start getting a little rough.

19:51.085 --> 19:53.121
Commander Tucker
and Lieutenant Reed also believe...

19:53.245 --> 19:55.076
that this would compromise
our mission.

19:55.205 --> 19:57.036
Your opinions have been noted.

19:57.685 --> 20:01.519
Now get back to Enterprise
and start the antimatter transfer.

20:02.245 --> 20:04.713
I'm sorry, Captain,
I can't obey that order.

20:11.085 --> 20:13.076
You may not be wearing a uniform...

20:14.085 --> 20:16.838
but you can still be charged
with insubordination.

20:17.445 --> 20:21.484
Perhaps we should contact Starfleet
and discuss this with Admiral Forrest.

20:25.005 --> 20:26.802
You're relieved as First Officer.

20:26.925 --> 20:30.918
Major, escort T'Pol back to the ship
and confine her to her quarters.

20:31.125 --> 20:32.956
- Sir?
- I gave you an order.

20:35.605 --> 20:36.594
Ma'am.

20:56.125 --> 20:57.194
Come in.

21:00.245 --> 21:02.236
The first shuttlepod is on its way.

21:02.365 --> 21:04.560
How long will it take to transfer
the antimatter?

21:04.685 --> 21:07.757
Using both shuttlepods,
about four or five hours.

21:10.445 --> 21:13.243
I didn't realise how badly I needed
a shower.

21:13.645 --> 21:16.034
I've spent too much time
in that hatchery.

21:16.405 --> 21:19.715
If you're looking for a new first officer,
you should consider Malcolm.

21:19.845 --> 21:21.836
You're going to want someone
on the Bridge full-time...

21:21.965 --> 21:23.398
I'm a little busy at the moment.

21:23.525 --> 21:26.358
I'm happy with the command structure
the way it is.

21:26.525 --> 21:28.243
This is only temporary.

21:28.685 --> 21:30.915
T'Pol just needed a slap on the wrist.

21:31.445 --> 21:34.084
She's questioned your orders
lots of times...

21:34.205 --> 21:36.639
but you've never locked her up before.

21:37.965 --> 21:40.957
You have to admit,
it's a little out of the ordinary.

21:41.085 --> 21:43.201
These aren't ordinary circumstances.

21:43.805 --> 21:46.558
T'Pol refused a direct order
in front of the crew.

21:47.205 --> 21:49.878
I can't have senior officers
behaving like that.

21:50.085 --> 21:52.360
Especially on a mission this important.

21:54.805 --> 21:57.683
Maybe you ought to confine me
to quarters, too, sir.

21:58.125 --> 22:01.242
Because I'm still not sure
we're doing the right thing here.

22:01.365 --> 22:03.481
If the roles were reversed...

22:03.605 --> 22:06.438
I can't imagine these Xindi
would do the same for us.

22:09.925 --> 22:14.396
My great-grandfather was in
North Africa during the Eugenics Wars.

22:15.645 --> 22:18.239
His battalion was evacuating civilians
from a war zone...

22:18.365 --> 22:20.162
when they came under attack.

22:20.565 --> 22:24.160
There was a school full of children
directly between them and the enemy.

22:24.285 --> 22:27.163
If his men had returned fire,
they might have hit it.

22:27.965 --> 22:30.559
So he called the commander
on the other side...

22:30.885 --> 22:35.675
and got him to agree to hold his fire
long enough to evacuate the school.

22:36.885 --> 22:39.353
There are rules, Trip, even in war.

22:42.245 --> 22:44.156
We have to help these children.

22:53.565 --> 22:56.602
This is what you wanted to show me?
A battle simulation?

22:56.725 --> 23:00.161
Scenarios like this can tell us a lot
about the enemy's tactical capabilities...

23:00.285 --> 23:02.515
much more than we'd learn
from a standard analysis.

23:02.645 --> 23:06.558
I asked you to look for weaknesses
in their shields, not to play more games.

23:06.685 --> 23:08.915
This isn't exactly a game, Lieutenant.

23:09.445 --> 23:12.198
The simulation found
that they're vulnerable here.

23:12.565 --> 23:15.363
They've got minimal shielding
around their impulse manifolds.

23:15.485 --> 23:18.318
A pair of torpedoes should be enough
to take out the engines.

23:18.445 --> 23:20.720
Those manifolds are pretty narrow...

23:21.085 --> 23:24.122
but our targeting scanners
should be able to get a lock.

23:26.125 --> 23:28.434
- Nice work.
- Thank you, sir.

23:30.725 --> 23:34.434
I apologise. I overreacted.

23:36.125 --> 23:39.242
- A lot of the crew's on edge lately.
- They certainly are.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.474
I heard things got pretty ugly
down there.

23:43.205 --> 23:46.322
It's not every day I'm asked
to confine a senior officer.

23:46.565 --> 23:48.999
I can't say I disagree
with the Captain's decision.

23:49.765 --> 23:52.757
If one of my men disobeyed orders,
I'd throw him in the stockade.

23:57.245 --> 23:58.917
I've got to get back to the Bridge.

23:59.045 --> 24:01.878
Let me know if your simulation
finds anything else.

24:10.765 --> 24:11.959
I need to see T'Pol.

24:12.085 --> 24:13.837
She's not supposed to have any visitors.

24:13.965 --> 24:14.954
This isn't a social call.

24:15.085 --> 24:18.236
I'm here for my neuro-pressure
treatment. Doctor's orders.

24:19.565 --> 24:22.398
You don't want me to bring Phlox
down here, do you?

24:28.645 --> 24:29.714
What's our status?

24:29.845 --> 24:32.154
The antimatter's on its way.
I had a talk with him.

24:32.285 --> 24:35.595
Everything's gonna be all right. This
whole thing'll blow over in a day or two.

24:35.725 --> 24:38.319
Our antimatter supply
will be depleted by then.

24:38.565 --> 24:43.002
The Captain's behaviour is becoming
increasingly illogical, even for a human.

24:44.165 --> 24:47.999
He's preoccupied with the hatchery,
he's displaying signs of paranoia.

24:48.165 --> 24:50.281
I think you're overstating things
just a little.

24:50.405 --> 24:52.794
You can't allow him
to use our antimatter.

24:53.005 --> 24:55.599
What do you suggest I do?
Start a mutiny?

24:55.725 --> 24:59.559
You have to speak with Phlox. Ask him
to run a full exam on the Captain.

24:59.685 --> 25:00.720
What good would that do?

25:00.845 --> 25:04.076
If the Doctor can find something
wrong, we may have medical grounds...

25:04.205 --> 25:06.924
- to relieve him of command.
- Relieve him?

25:07.365 --> 25:10.038
Look, I know you're upset
about what happened...

25:10.165 --> 25:12.235
but I think you're taking this personally.

25:12.365 --> 25:14.925
How long before the reactor
is brought online?

25:15.445 --> 25:19.484
Assuming Hoshi can translate
the interface, about 12 hours.

25:19.605 --> 25:23.200
You have to delay it until we can verify
the Captain's mental state.

25:23.325 --> 25:26.761
If he finds out what we're doing,
we'll both end up in the Brig.

25:30.205 --> 25:32.275
You're asking me to betray him.

25:32.405 --> 25:36.478
You can't allow your personal feelings
for the Captain to affect your decision.

25:36.605 --> 25:39.961
We both know he's endangering
this ship and our mission.

25:44.685 --> 25:46.084
What is it?

25:46.205 --> 25:48.844
A subspace vortex is opening
off the port bow.

25:48.965 --> 25:50.523
Tactical Alert.

25:51.285 --> 25:53.515
Captain Archer, report to the Bridge.

25:59.565 --> 26:01.760
It's an Insectoid.
Three bio-signs aboard.

26:01.885 --> 26:03.079
They're firing.

26:04.605 --> 26:06.516
They're moving away at full impulse.

26:06.645 --> 26:10.923
Pursuit course. Arm phase-cannons.
Disable their engines.

26:18.885 --> 26:19.874
No effect.

26:20.005 --> 26:23.793
Their main deflector's charging.
They could be trying to open a vortex.

26:24.725 --> 26:29.037
Torpedoes. Maximum yield.
Target their impulse manifolds.

26:29.325 --> 26:30.644
- Ready.
- Fire.

26:38.125 --> 26:41.003
- What the hell's going on?
- An Insectoid ship, sir.

26:43.605 --> 26:44.833
You destroyed them?

26:44.965 --> 26:47.604
They were opening a vortex.
They would have escaped.

26:47.725 --> 26:50.478
The crew might have been able to
take care of the hatchery.

26:50.605 --> 26:51.879
Sir?

26:52.005 --> 26:55.077
We could have kept our antimatter
and continued the mission.

26:55.205 --> 26:58.322
They would have told their superiors,
sir, given away our position.

26:58.445 --> 27:00.436
If you'd explained to them
why we were here...

27:00.565 --> 27:02.795
you might have avoided a fire-fight.

27:02.925 --> 27:07.123
With all due respect, sir, they didn't
seem particularly interested in talking.

27:12.445 --> 27:14.595
- Archer to Major Hayes.
- Go ahead, Captain.

27:14.725 --> 27:16.443
Report to my Ready Room,
on the double.

27:16.565 --> 27:17.884
Aye, sir.

27:20.805 --> 27:23.035
I'm relieving you as Tactical Officer.

27:23.445 --> 27:26.084
From now on,
you'll report to Major Hayes.

27:26.205 --> 27:29.754
I did what was necessary
to protect this ship and its mission.

27:29.885 --> 27:32.274
You'll be confined to quarters
until further notice.

27:32.405 --> 27:34.282
- Captain!
- Dismissed.

27:39.765 --> 27:41.039
Yes, sir.

27:46.485 --> 27:49.283
- Are you done with that translation?
- Almost.

27:49.405 --> 27:52.795
I want you to put together a distress call
in the Insectoid language.

27:52.925 --> 27:55.917
Transmit it on all frequencies
as soon as you're ready.

27:56.525 --> 27:57.719
Understood.

28:00.245 --> 28:02.884
There's nothing more important
than the success of this mission.

28:03.005 --> 28:04.518
- Do you agree, Major?
- Of course, sir.

28:04.645 --> 28:08.274
My senior officers don't seem to
understand what I'm trying to do here.

28:08.405 --> 28:09.918
I guess I have myself to blame.

28:10.045 --> 28:12.513
In the past, I've encouraged them
to ask questions...

28:12.645 --> 28:14.636
but we don't have time for that now.

28:14.845 --> 28:18.121
I need officers who respect the chain
of command and can follow orders.

28:18.245 --> 28:19.963
It won't be a problem, sir.

28:21.165 --> 28:22.757
I thought what happened with T'Pol...

28:22.885 --> 28:26.195
might have been an isolated incident
but I'm not so sure now.

28:26.445 --> 28:29.482
Lieutenant Reed destroyed a ship
that could have helped us.

28:29.605 --> 28:33.484
I'm starting to wonder if he deliberately
tried to sabotage this mission.

28:35.805 --> 28:37.796
You're in command
while I'm on the surface.

28:37.925 --> 28:41.042
You answer to me and me alone.
Is that understood, Major?

28:41.365 --> 28:43.560
- Perfectly, sir.
- That'll be all.

28:54.565 --> 28:57.398
- Can we talk to you for a minute, sir?
- What is it?

29:00.285 --> 29:02.674
I'd like you to go to Sickbay with Phlox.

29:03.405 --> 29:05.077
Do I look sick to you?

29:05.485 --> 29:08.477
Hoshi says you ordered her
to transmit a distress call.

29:09.445 --> 29:10.878
That's right.

29:11.005 --> 29:13.439
Don't you think that's a little dangerous?

29:13.645 --> 29:16.796
We'll be light-years from here
before the Xindi respond to it.

29:16.925 --> 29:19.200
We don't know how far away
their ships are.

29:19.325 --> 29:22.078
If we send that message,
we'll be taking a hell of a risk.

29:22.205 --> 29:26.039
We can't afford to play it safe anymore.
This mission's too important.

29:26.165 --> 29:28.121
This mission is to save Earth...

29:29.365 --> 29:31.117
not an alien hatchery.

29:31.245 --> 29:34.362
Captain, you haven't eaten or slept
in almost two days.

29:34.525 --> 29:37.642
You've shown signs
of obsessional behaviour and paranoia.

29:43.485 --> 29:45.555
If it'll make the two of you feel better...

29:45.685 --> 29:48.358
I'll go to Sickbay
for a complete physical...

29:51.085 --> 29:54.760
- as soon as that reactor's online.
- That's not good enough, sir.

29:55.605 --> 29:58.278
Phlox has the authority
to order you to Sickbay.

29:59.965 --> 30:02.160
T'Pol is manipulating you, isn't she?

30:02.885 --> 30:05.240
If I'm declared unfit for duty,
then she takes over.

30:05.365 --> 30:06.957
Captain, if you won't come with me...

30:07.085 --> 30:09.599
I'll be required under
Starfleet Order 104, Section C...

30:09.725 --> 30:11.158
to relieve you of command.

30:11.285 --> 30:13.674
I expected something like this
from her...

30:15.205 --> 30:17.799
but not from the two of you. Corporal.

30:20.045 --> 30:23.117
I've already confined
two senior officers today.

30:37.885 --> 30:41.355
- His neurochemistry appears normal.
- There's nothing wrong with him?

30:41.485 --> 30:42.759
This scan is hardly conclusive.

30:42.885 --> 30:44.921
I'll need to get him into
the imaging chamber...

30:45.045 --> 30:46.717
and run a complete neurological series.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.597
When Hoshi sends that distress call...

30:48.725 --> 30:52.081
every Xindi ship that picks it up
will start heading this way.

30:53.605 --> 30:56.961
He's got Hayes on the Bridge,
MACOs posted all over the ship.

30:58.845 --> 31:01.598
Whatever we do,
we're going to have to do it fast.

31:02.325 --> 31:04.361
What are you proposing, Commander?

31:05.645 --> 31:08.284
I think it's time we throw the rule book
out the window.

31:19.205 --> 31:20.433
Captain.

31:33.845 --> 31:36.484
- I'm sorry, sir, no visitors.
- You let me in before.

31:36.605 --> 31:38.243
I have new orders from Major Hayes.

31:38.365 --> 31:41.721
Look, T'Pol was a little rough with me
during the last session.

31:41.845 --> 31:43.437
I think she caused some nerve damage.

31:43.565 --> 31:45.362
You'll have to speak with the Major, sir.

31:45.485 --> 31:46.474
This is a Starfleet ship.

31:46.605 --> 31:48.641
I don't have to ask Major Hayes
for anything.

31:48.765 --> 31:51.643
- Step away, sir.
- Stand down, Corporal.

31:54.485 --> 31:56.441
The Captain gave Hayes
control of the Bridge...

31:56.565 --> 31:57.634
posted MACOs on every deck.

31:57.765 --> 31:59.118
- Is he still on the surface?
- Yeah.

31:59.245 --> 32:01.839
Retrieving him and the antimatter
should be the priority.

32:01.965 --> 32:04.957
I'd advise securing the Bridge first.
If Hayes gets wind of this...

32:05.085 --> 32:06.757
we could have a fire-fight on our hands.

32:06.885 --> 32:09.115
Perhaps we should approach the Major,
and explain the situation.

32:09.245 --> 32:10.963
- He seems like a reasonable man.
- That would be risky.

32:11.085 --> 32:14.680
If Hayes sides with the Captain,
this mutiny will be over before it begins.

32:14.805 --> 32:17.842
We'll need more people.
Who's on duty in the Armoury?

32:18.005 --> 32:19.597
Ensign Walsh and two of my men.

32:19.725 --> 32:22.922
They'll side with us,
but Hayes posted two MACO there.

32:28.885 --> 32:32.355
- Take the shuttlepod back to Enterprise.
- What about you, sir?

32:32.485 --> 32:33.759
You heard me.

32:48.885 --> 32:50.113
Hold it.

32:50.485 --> 32:51.600
Sorry.

32:53.765 --> 32:55.676
That's going to leave a bruise.

33:01.805 --> 33:04.000
- All right. You're with me.
- Yes, sir.

33:30.645 --> 33:33.034
Well, we won't get to the Bridge
this way.

34:01.205 --> 34:02.354
Captain!

34:13.965 --> 34:15.762
Captain, it's Trip!

34:18.565 --> 34:20.601
You shouldn't have weapons in here.

34:31.125 --> 34:32.319
Go ahead.

34:32.445 --> 34:36.040
Major, Corporal Chang's been found
unconscious in T'Pol's quarters.

34:36.165 --> 34:38.520
- Where's T'Pol?
- Not here, sir.

34:39.205 --> 34:41.002
Hayes to the Armoury.

34:43.085 --> 34:44.563
Armoury, respond.

34:49.445 --> 34:50.878
Stand down!

34:56.885 --> 35:00.195
- You intend to shoot me, Lieutenant?
- Tell them to stand down.

35:00.325 --> 35:03.522
The Captain relieved you of duty.
Both of you.

35:03.645 --> 35:06.523
We don't want anyone injured.
Put down your weapons.

35:06.685 --> 35:10.644
Until the Captain says otherwise,
I give the orders on this Bridge.

35:18.685 --> 35:21.961
- Go back to the ship.
- You have to come with us.

35:28.605 --> 35:29.799
Captain.

35:35.165 --> 35:36.803
It's all right.

35:52.605 --> 35:54.960
- Contact the Captain.
- Belay that.

35:57.085 --> 35:59.280
I gave you a direct order, Ensign.

36:00.885 --> 36:02.603
I'm sorry, Major.

36:23.565 --> 36:25.157
It's over, Major.

36:30.725 --> 36:32.841
- Take him to his quarters.
- Aye, sir.

36:34.685 --> 36:36.880
- It's Commander Tucker.
- Put him through.

36:37.005 --> 36:38.996
- Go ahead.
- We've got the Captain.

36:39.125 --> 36:42.117
- What's going on up there?
- The Bridge is secure.

36:42.645 --> 36:45.113
Tell Phlox to get
the imaging chamber ready.

36:45.645 --> 36:47.442
We've got a patient for him.

36:50.165 --> 36:52.599
Acting Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

36:52.725 --> 36:55.239
We've resumed our course
for Azati Prime.

36:55.365 --> 36:58.516
Major Hayes and his men have been
temporarily relieved of duty.

36:58.645 --> 37:02.763
Dr. Phlox believes he has found an
explanation for the Captain's behaviour.

37:02.885 --> 37:06.560
- Where is he?
- In his quarters, resting.

37:07.805 --> 37:11.684
Do you recall when the Captain
was attacked by one of the eggs?

37:12.005 --> 37:16.317
- It sprayed something in his face.
- And I thought it was a defence reflex.

37:17.125 --> 37:19.685
But it was actually something
far more sophisticated.

37:19.805 --> 37:22.080
The substance contained
a unique neurochemical.

37:22.205 --> 37:24.639
It infiltrated the Captain's
synaptic pathways...

37:24.765 --> 37:28.280
causing him to reverse-imprint
on the baby Insectoids.

37:28.565 --> 37:33.241
It's the opposite of what happens when
a young animal bonds with its mother.

37:33.805 --> 37:36.558
Are you saying he thought
he was the mother of those things?

37:36.685 --> 37:38.198
Well, more likely, a caretaker.

37:38.325 --> 37:40.793
Of course, the Captain didn't realize this
on a conscious level.

37:40.925 --> 37:43.678
Eventually, he became obsessed
with protecting the eggs...

37:43.805 --> 37:47.115
- to the exclusion of everything else.
- Including our mission.

37:48.485 --> 37:50.715
I'd like to speak with him,
if you don't mind.

37:50.845 --> 37:54.474
He'll be awake in a few hours.
He should be fully recovered by then.

37:55.405 --> 37:57.999
I want you and your men
to return to duty.

37:58.205 --> 37:59.524
Yes, ma'am.

38:06.045 --> 38:08.923
Not the sort of thing
they trained us for at West Point.

38:09.045 --> 38:10.524
I imagine not.

38:12.805 --> 38:16.036
You could have come to me,
explained the situation.

38:17.325 --> 38:20.635
We couldn't take the chance
that you'd side with the Captain.

38:22.405 --> 38:25.238
- I probably would have.
- Yeah.

38:34.285 --> 38:35.479
Come in.

38:40.325 --> 38:44.284
- I didn't mean to wake you, sir.
- It's all right, I was getting up anyway.

38:44.845 --> 38:47.518
- How are you feeling?
- I've been better.

38:49.045 --> 38:51.354
You sure you had that pistol set to stun?

38:51.885 --> 38:53.318
Captain.

38:55.645 --> 38:58.637
I hope you understand
if there'd been any other way...

38:58.965 --> 39:03.083
You were protecting our mission, Trip.
I would have done the same thing.

39:03.205 --> 39:06.754
Still, I never thought I'd find myself
pointing a weapon at you...

39:07.285 --> 39:09.321
no matter what the circumstances.

39:09.845 --> 39:12.040
Let's put this behind us, okay?

39:13.365 --> 39:14.718
Yes, sir.

39:16.605 --> 39:17.924
What's our status?

39:18.045 --> 39:21.003
We just recovered the last
of our antimatter reserves.

39:22.365 --> 39:23.718
The hatchlings?

39:24.005 --> 39:27.361
Phlox says there's 19 of them
running around down there.

39:27.805 --> 39:31.354
Chances are they'll survive
until the next Xindi ship comes along.

39:32.045 --> 39:34.036
It's time we got back on the road.

39:35.045 --> 39:36.603
I want you at your post.

39:36.965 --> 39:40.844
We're going to be pushing the engines
pretty hard. I'll be on the Bridge.

39:41.045 --> 39:44.082
- Aren't you supposed to get some rest?
- I've had plenty.

39:45.165 --> 39:48.475
I'm sorry, sir,
but the Doctor was insistent.

39:51.125 --> 39:52.319
Okay.

39:53.245 --> 39:55.884
I guess I don't want another mutiny
on my hands.

39:57.085 --> 39:59.724
Tell Travis to set a course
for Azati Prime, maximum warp.

39:59.845 --> 40:01.403
Right away, sir.
