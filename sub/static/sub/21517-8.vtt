05:11.979 --> 05:12.979

-You know, so maybe you

05:34.376 --> 05:38.045

05:38.046 --> 05:40.506
That is my... my Achilles heel.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.744

is let them go.

And that's what you're doing
for your sister

06:13.582 --> 06:16.626

actually, is to say...

10:22.414 --> 10:25.166
of the executive producer

10:25.167 --> 10:26.792
<i>of</i> Project Runway.

10:26.793 --> 10:30.588
My stress level just went up
like a hundred points.

10:30.589 --> 10:32.006
Hey, designers.
I'm Gus Dominguez,

10:32.007 --> 10:34.050
lighting director on the show.
I'm gonna be nominating

10:34.051 --> 10:35.593
-my friend Analyssa.
-Hi.

10:35.594 --> 10:37.929
Do me a favor--
take care of her.

10:37.930 --> 10:39.013
I'm watching you guys.

10:39.014 --> 10:40.431
-(laughter)
-TIM: Analyssa,

10:40.432 --> 10:42.600
-you are with Brandon.
-Hi. -Hi.

10:42.601 --> 10:46.145
Hi, designers. I'm nominating
my mom, Sabrina Hocking.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.481
She was diagnosed with
breast cancer three years ago,

10:48.482 --> 10:51.526
and she's finally starting to
get her energy and spirit back,

10:51.527 --> 10:56.781
so I need a new look for her
to bring back her confidence.

10:56.782 --> 10:59.200
-Hello.
-How are you?

10:59.201 --> 11:01.035
SAPNA SHAH:
I want to nominate my mom.

11:01.036 --> 11:03.913
She wants a look
for an upcoming wedding.

11:03.914 --> 11:05.706
-Hi.
-Nice to meet you. Hi.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.542
KRISTEN ADAMS: I'd like
to nominate my mom, Michele,

11:07.543 --> 11:10.211
because it's my mom's first time
being a grandmother,

11:10.212 --> 11:11.712
and she doesn't want
to start dressing

11:11.713 --> 11:12.797
like a traditional grandmother.

11:12.798 --> 11:15.216
ice to meet you.
-KENYA: <i>Oh, she gives me</i>

11:15.217 --> 11:16.050
the biggest hug ever--

11:16.051 --> 11:18.511
like one of those mama hugs,
you know?

11:18.512 --> 11:20.555
We immediately connected.

11:20.556 --> 11:21.848
(laughing)

11:21.849 --> 11:23.891
CLIVE SALMON: I'm nominating
my friend Gina Dunlop.

11:23.892 --> 11:26.143
So bring it. That's all I'm
gonna say to y'all-- bring it.

11:26.144 --> 11:28.896
Hi. Come on in. Nice to
meet you. -Nice to meet you.

11:28.897 --> 11:30.439
CHANDLER DEWITT:
My mom, she's the epitome

11:30.440 --> 11:32.567
-of a woman on the go.
-Hi.

11:32.568 --> 11:34.569
And is in desperate need
of a day-to-night look.

11:34.570 --> 11:38.239
You look just like
your daughter. -(laughter)

11:38.240 --> 11:39.156
Hi. I'm Oscar Cordova.

11:39.157 --> 11:41.951
I nominate my wife,
Cynthia Cordova.

11:41.952 --> 11:44.120
Yay! Your jumper's so cute.

11:44.121 --> 11:45.413
Hi. Nice to meet you.

11:45.414 --> 11:46.539
I nominate my wife.

11:46.540 --> 11:47.999
Designers, hook her up.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.960
I want her to feel and know
that she's beautiful. -Hi.

11:50.961 --> 11:52.628
Come on, gorgeous.
I'm so excited.

11:52.629 --> 11:54.547
HALONA:Most of the time,
 I'm wearing jeans

11:54.548 --> 11:57.091
and a T-shirt
because I'm an at-home mom,

11:57.092 --> 11:58.384
<i>but my outfit here</i>

11:58.385 --> 12:01.137
is gonna be really,
really, really nice.

12:01.138 --> 12:03.973
-We'll make you look good.
-TIM: Now that we have

12:03.974 --> 12:06.559
our designer/client pairings,
there is

12:06.560 --> 12:08.728
one more element
to this challenge.

12:08.729 --> 12:12.773
You will also be creating
a custom print

12:12.774 --> 12:15.568
that is to be featured
within your look.

12:15.569 --> 12:16.903
-(designers gasping, murmuring)
-TERESA: And...

12:16.904 --> 12:18.571
we will take the winning
designer's look

12:18.572 --> 12:21.657
and their custom print,
and we'll use it

12:21.658 --> 12:23.951
to inspire a special
Dixie to-go cup

12:23.952 --> 12:26.370
which will be available
for purchase

12:26.371 --> 12:28.789
-at retailers and online.
-All right!

12:28.790 --> 12:30.583
Cool.

12:31.668 --> 12:36.297
Not only that.
The winner will receive $25,000,

12:36.298 --> 12:38.299
-courtesy of Dixie.
-Whoa.

12:38.300 --> 12:42.261
-Whoa.
-Did I hear that right?

12:42.262 --> 12:44.472
This is... Wow.

12:44.473 --> 12:46.265
KENYA:
<i>They better call the medic,</i>

12:46.266 --> 12:47.975
<i>'cause I'm gonna pass out.</i>

12:47.976 --> 12:49.477
I-I'm gonna... (laughs)

12:49.478 --> 12:51.395
MARGARITA (sighing):
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

12:51.396 --> 12:53.022
<i>This is huge.</i>

12:53.649 --> 12:55.149
This is life-changing.

12:55.150 --> 12:57.026
TIM: Teresa, we're so grateful
to you and to Dixie.

12:57.027 --> 13:00.196
-Thank you so very much.
-Oh, thank you for having us.

13:00.197 --> 13:01.948
Good luck, everyone,
and I can't wait

13:01.949 --> 13:03.491
-to see your designs.
-DESIGNERS: Thank you.

13:03.492 --> 13:05.535
TIM:
Thanks, Teresa.

13:05.536 --> 13:07.036
All right, now,
down to some business.

13:07.037 --> 13:08.704
You have two days
for this challenge.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.915
-(designers murmuring)
-TIM: You will have 30 minutes

13:10.916 --> 13:12.792
to meet with your new client,

13:12.793 --> 13:14.627
and then an additional
20 minutes

13:14.628 --> 13:15.962
to finalize your print.

13:15.963 --> 13:18.256
Your print-design fabric
will be

13:18.257 --> 13:19.340
delivered tomorrow morning.

13:19.341 --> 13:22.510
After your session
with your clients,

13:22.511 --> 13:23.594
we're going to Mood

13:23.595 --> 13:26.097
-for additional materials.
-Sure.

13:26.098 --> 13:27.181
I'll be back.

13:27.182 --> 13:28.766
MICHAEL:
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

13:28.767 --> 13:29.851
I'm so excited.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.269
GINA:
I kind of want some spunk

13:31.270 --> 13:34.272
kind of just to match my
personality. -Okay. Okay. Okay.

13:34.273 --> 13:35.022
(laughing)

13:35.023 --> 13:37.191
MICHAEL: As far as a print,
do you like abstract?

13:37.192 --> 13:39.694
I'm Native American,
so one of the things... -Cool.

13:39.695 --> 13:42.488
...I like is the Native
American prints. -Yeah.

13:42.489 --> 13:45.366
It's funny that it's a pattern,
because I was gonna tell you,

13:45.367 --> 13:46.659
"I don't wear any patterns,"

13:46.660 --> 13:48.953
-but now I'm like, "Oh, Lord."
-Okay.

13:50.581 --> 13:52.707
CLAIRE:She hates prints.
 This is a print challenge.

13:52.708 --> 13:53.875
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

13:53.876 --> 13:56.544
What I was thinking
would be having

13:56.545 --> 13:57.879
one leg be printed...

13:57.880 --> 14:00.548
<i>-Okay. Okay.
 -...on just the front,</i>

14:00.549 --> 14:03.634
where everything else
would be more neutral.

14:03.635 --> 14:05.720
So, how do you feel about
wearing, like, a skirt? -Yeah.

14:05.721 --> 14:08.055
-Or, like... pencil skirt?
-I could do... Yeah.

14:08.056 --> 14:10.725
I want a dress. Long sleeves.

14:10.726 --> 14:13.477
The fact that you want long
sleeves-- awesome. (laughs)

14:13.478 --> 14:15.479
-Okay. Got it.
-So I do have a longer waist.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.732
I... you know, I'm
a little more busty and hip...

14:17.733 --> 14:19.650
-You got cute curves.
-(laughs)

14:19.651 --> 14:22.236
-Thank you.
-You gotta let 'em know.

14:22.237 --> 14:25.573
<i>For Michele,
 I'm thinking a pleated top</i>

14:25.574 --> 14:29.243
<i>and a nice, high-waisted,
fitted skirt so, like,</i>

14:29.244 --> 14:30.828
when she walks,
her skirt is kind of

14:30.829 --> 14:32.622
doing a little something
like this.

14:32.623 --> 14:34.207
I think she's gonna be hot.

14:34.208 --> 14:36.334
-(laughing)
-That's it. That's it.

14:36.335 --> 14:37.210
Perfect.

14:37.211 --> 14:39.378
-Talk to me about colors.
-I like to go out.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.756
I like to have fun,
but when I travel,

14:41.757 --> 14:43.007
I just pack all black.

14:43.008 --> 14:44.634
Okay. Well, that's smart
for traveling.

14:44.635 --> 14:47.261
<i>I love designing textiles.
 Like, I love doing florals.</i>

14:47.262 --> 14:49.055
I love doing watercolors,

14:49.056 --> 14:50.515
<i>organic kind of shapes,</i>

14:50.516 --> 14:51.432
so I'm excited.

14:51.433 --> 14:53.017
Do you like florals?

14:53.018 --> 14:55.520
I kind of like, um...
I like geometrics.

14:55.521 --> 14:57.605
MARGARITA:
<i>I'm like...</i>

14:57.606 --> 14:58.481
"Okay, great."

14:58.482 --> 15:00.316
KENTARO: You want to have,
like, long dress

15:00.317 --> 15:01.776
because, for a wedding,
you don't want

15:01.777 --> 15:04.111
-to do short, right?
-Right. Right.

15:04.112 --> 15:05.363
My client, she's a beautiful

15:05.364 --> 15:07.406
<i>Indian lady,
so I'm pushing myself</i>

15:07.407 --> 15:08.616
<i>out of my comfort zone.</i>

15:08.617 --> 15:09.867
<i>I'm going to use a lot</i>

15:09.868 --> 15:11.452
<i>of strong colors,
like fuchsia,</i>

15:11.453 --> 15:13.955
pink and orange and red,
and things like that.

15:13.956 --> 15:16.499
My favorite color's purple,
but I would never wear purple.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.793
-Oh, never? Why?
-I don't know.

15:18.794 --> 15:21.796
I feel like colors like purple,
green really, like, just

15:21.797 --> 15:23.673
bring out your energy
and your confidence. -Okay.

15:23.674 --> 15:25.842
'Cause you need some color
to just make you stand out.

15:25.843 --> 15:27.009
-Yeah.
-And make you beautiful.

15:27.010 --> 15:29.470
<i>Sabrina, she is
 a great inspiration,</i>

15:29.471 --> 15:31.305
<i>and I just want to show her</i>

15:31.306 --> 15:32.723
as a bright light on the runway.

15:32.724 --> 15:35.726
-I feel good about this.
-How would you feel if, um...

15:35.727 --> 15:37.812
um... I don't think I need to...

15:37.813 --> 15:40.356
No, I don't need
to measure your ankle.

15:40.357 --> 15:42.692
CECILIA:
<i>I feel like Claire's head</i>

15:42.693 --> 15:43.901
is somewhere else.

15:43.902 --> 15:45.278
(groans)

15:45.279 --> 15:48.823
I'm getting nervous energy
from her. Very tense.

15:48.824 --> 15:52.827
CLAIRE: Last week,
my twin sister went home.

15:52.828 --> 15:55.454
I'm sad your sister went home,
but I'm glad

15:55.455 --> 15:59.125
I'm the first person
that you're working with.

15:59.126 --> 16:00.293
We're going to keep going

16:00.294 --> 16:01.544
and proceed
and make great things,

16:01.545 --> 16:03.796
and I want to make the most
of... of all...

16:03.797 --> 16:05.715
-everything that we're doing.
-Yeah, you gotta use...

16:05.716 --> 16:08.968
you have to use your energy
for positive, but we rollin'.

16:08.969 --> 16:09.969
Come on.

16:09.970 --> 16:12.889
-(grunts) All right!
-Get with it.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.266
All right, designers.

16:15.267 --> 16:16.809
Say good-bye to your clients.

16:16.810 --> 16:18.811
And, after your clients leave,

16:18.812 --> 16:21.731
you'll have 20 minutes
to design your print.

16:21.732 --> 16:22.565
All righty. Bye.

16:22.566 --> 16:24.984
-Bye. -Bye.
-Bye.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.530
Need more red.

16:29.531 --> 16:30.865
-Hello.
-Hi. Kenya.

16:30.866 --> 16:32.325
ice to meet you, Kenya.
-Nice to meet you.

16:32.326 --> 16:35.369
KENYA: <i>How many people
can say that their print</i>

16:35.370 --> 16:36.370
is on a Dixie cup?

16:36.371 --> 16:37.705
AMY:
You've never had to

16:37.706 --> 16:39.123
speed-design before, have you?
(laughs)

16:39.124 --> 16:41.918
Welcome to <i>Project Runway.
</i>-AYANA:The rigidness

16:41.919 --> 16:44.545
is actually okay, 'cause it kind
of looks like a brushstroke.

16:44.546 --> 16:46.797
<i>My print design is essentially</i>

16:46.798 --> 16:48.799
the word "Dixie" in Arabic.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.301
That's not bad.

16:50.302 --> 16:51.594
I-I want something that's...

16:51.595 --> 16:52.887
that's kind of more graphic.

16:52.888 --> 16:55.723
<i>My idea is to create
 a very large</i>

16:55.724 --> 16:58.601
<i>zigzag pattern
out of a brushstroke.</i>

16:58.602 --> 17:00.394
It's an overall print
that, I think,

17:00.395 --> 17:02.063
<i>is more in keeping with what</i>

17:02.064 --> 17:03.940
Cecilia favors
from her clothing.

17:03.941 --> 17:08.236
I think the main thing I do want
to do is the shapes first.

17:08.237 --> 17:09.444
KENTARO:
I'm going to have a...

17:09.445 --> 17:10.905
probably, like,
a one-inch stripe.

17:10.906 --> 17:12.406
Just run them like...
da-da-da-da-da.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.282
-Is that big enough?
-That's perfect. Yeah.

17:14.284 --> 17:16.368
I want to stretch it out
so it can look

17:16.369 --> 17:17.494
more like tie-dye a little bit.

17:17.496 --> 17:19.121
I bet we could smudge it
as well.

17:19.122 --> 17:20.915
I love patterns, bold prints,

17:20.915 --> 17:22.250
<i>anything that pops</i>

17:22.251 --> 17:23.792
and make you go, "Wow."

17:23.794 --> 17:25.586
<i>So, this is my challenge.</i>

17:25.587 --> 17:26.921
-I like. I like.
-Okay.

17:26.922 --> 17:29.841
I want it to repeat four times,
but I don't want it to do that.

17:29.842 --> 17:31.008
But I only have ten minutes,

17:31.009 --> 17:32.969
so we're just gonna roll
with it.

17:32.970 --> 17:34.428
<i>I ended up with a design

17:34.429 --> 17:35.805
<i>what it's gonna
look like, guys.</i>

17:35.806 --> 17:36.722
It might be tribal.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.891
<i>It might be graphic.</i>

17:38.892 --> 17:41.018
We don't know.
It's a <i>sorpresa</i> on the making.

17:41.019 --> 17:43.396
-Thanks. Thank you.
-(horns honking)

17:43.397 --> 17:46.732

 you have 30 minutes to shop.

17:48.610 --> 17:49.694

-Yeah.

<i>and she loves purple,</i>

18:10.299 --> 18:12.216
<i>so I'm adding purple
 to her life.</i>

18:12.217 --> 18:15.303
<i>I also got some denim.
I felt it worked</i>

18:15.304 --> 18:16.345
with what she wanted.

18:16.346 --> 18:18.973
Designers, time is up.

18:18.974 --> 18:21.559
Thank you, Mood.

18:26.648 --> 18:29.317
CLAIRE:
<i>I wish that Shawn were here.</i>

18:29.318 --> 18:33.404
I pinned a card and some photos
<i>on my dress form.</i>

18:33.405 --> 18:34.989
I need a piece
of my family with me

18:34.990 --> 18:39.202
because I need to be positive
<i>and think about</i>

18:39.203 --> 18:41.871
why I'm here
and who I'm here for.

18:41.872 --> 18:43.789
Excuse me. Thank you.

18:50.339 --> 18:51.839
It's gonna tie like this?

18:51.840 --> 18:53.925
MICHAEL: It's supposed to look
like a Native American blanket.

18:53.926 --> 18:55.343
-Oh, cool.
-MICHAEL: <i>I want to make Halona</i>

18:55.344 --> 18:58.971
a jumpsuit with her traditional
<i>Native American roots.</i>

18:58.972 --> 19:00.723
<i>So I want to have
 a lot of draping</i>

19:00.724 --> 19:03.351
<i>and a lot of folding over
 to mimic</i>

19:03.352 --> 19:05.811
the blanket style around her.

19:06.897 --> 19:07.939
KENTARO:
Oh, my God.

19:07.940 --> 19:10.233
-(chuckles)
-(slap)

19:10.859 --> 19:14.487
I'm trying to figure out
a top for her.

19:17.032 --> 19:21.035
young and fresh, but I'm almost
thinking that I should

19:21.036 --> 19:25.039
do more like
a peplum-style tank top.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.750
BRANDON:Shawn is gone.
 Claire doesn't really have

19:27.751 --> 19:28.835
<i>her person to kind of</i>

19:28.836 --> 19:31.128
run to and, uh,
bounce ideas off of,

19:31.129 --> 19:33.297
<i>and so she seems just lost.</i>

19:33.298 --> 19:35.633
CLAIRE:
Uh, yeah...

19:35.634 --> 19:39.220
Let's see if I can do
something with that.

19:39.221 --> 19:41.222
<i>I am incorporating pleating</i>

19:41.223 --> 19:46.060
<i>and different design lines
</i> and sculpting the silhouette,

19:46.061 --> 19:51.399
<i>and I really think that it
 is going to elevate my look</i>

19:51.400 --> 19:53.234
and really please Cecilia.

20:00.284 --> 20:03.244
MARGARITA: <i>Claire's sitting
in front of me,</i>

20:03.245 --> 20:05.121
<i>and I can't help but notice
 that she's</i>

20:05.122 --> 20:09.083
<i>draping a piece
 that looks damn near exact</i>

20:09.084 --> 20:12.420
<i>what I made for JCPenney
 last week.</i>

20:15.799 --> 20:17.383
(Kentaro laughs)

20:22.181 --> 20:24.932
I've known that the twins
knock off other designs,

20:24.933 --> 20:29.812
and I was complacent with it,
<i>but now she is copying me.</i>

20:30.689 --> 20:31.981
<i>I'm, like...</i>

20:31.982 --> 20:33.441
trying to stay focused on what

20:33.442 --> 20:36.360
<i>I'm doing, but I want
 everybody to play fair.</i>

20:36.361 --> 20:38.279
She's like my friend,
but at the same time,

20:38.280 --> 20:39.405
it's like, she's not my friend,

20:39.406 --> 20:40.740
because a friend
wouldn't do that.

20:40.741 --> 20:43.409
It's bugging the (bleep)
out of me right now.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.953
She is knocking off
my shirtdress.

20:45.954 --> 20:47.163
(bleep) crazy.

20:47.164 --> 20:48.831
I will just raise hell

20:48.832 --> 20:50.208
if she wins with my knockoff.

20:50.209 --> 20:52.126
Do you think the judges
will notice?

20:52.127 --> 20:54.003
No. They'll probably be like,
"This is brilliant.

20:54.004 --> 20:55.963
Where did you come up
with this idea?"

20:55.964 --> 20:57.632
AMY:
<i>Margarita is just...</i>

20:57.633 --> 21:00.009
festering a little bit,
which isn't healthy.

21:00.010 --> 21:02.136
<i>I feel bad for her.</i>

21:02.137 --> 21:03.679
(sighs)

21:04.890 --> 21:06.557
MARGARITA:
<i>I'm so pissed. I gotta stop</i>

21:06.558 --> 21:08.476
<i>looking around the workroom,
but it's, like,</i>

21:08.477 --> 21:10.811
<i>right in front of me.
I just can't help it.</i>

21:10.812 --> 21:12.104
It is just blowing my mind.

21:12.105 --> 21:13.981
Like, I'm about
to cry right now.

21:13.982 --> 21:15.650
This is so frustrating.

21:16.109 --> 21:18.194
<i>I might just explode.</i>

21:22.366 --> 21:25.159
HEIDI:
♪ ♪Coming

21:26.912 --> 21:30.540
-I can't wait to see my fabric.
-Oh, I like it a lot.

21:30.541 --> 21:33.501
-Ooh.
-Super cool.

21:33.502 --> 21:36.546
-Can I just use as a scarf?
-(laughter)

21:36.547 --> 21:39.423
My print kicks ass.

21:39.424 --> 21:41.133
It came out kind of light,
but...

21:41.134 --> 21:42.718
BATANI:
<i>My printed fabric is</i>

21:42.719 --> 21:45.513
spaced out further
than I wanted it to be,

21:45.514 --> 21:49.058
<i>but I decided already that I'm
just going to cut it out</i>

21:49.059 --> 21:51.477
and make, you know,
a new design with it.

21:51.478 --> 21:52.728
Oh, man.

21:52.729 --> 21:54.939
My print's awful.
I mean, it looks tribal.

21:54.940 --> 22:00.027
<i>The color is like a cheesy
 pink fuchsia, like Barbie,</i>

22:00.028 --> 22:03.698
<i>and to top it off, I just kept
 thinking in my head,</i>

22:03.699 --> 22:05.199
I can't believe Claire
is actually

22:05.200 --> 22:08.578
<i>making what I did
 for the last challenge.</i>

22:08.579 --> 22:10.663
(fabric tearing)

22:11.248 --> 22:13.708
MARGARITA:
Girl... I believe in karma.

22:13.709 --> 22:17.712
-KENYA: Just be flattered.
-I am. What makes me sad

22:17.713 --> 22:20.089
is that somebody else

22:20.090 --> 22:21.757
with genuine and original design
will go home.

22:21.758 --> 22:24.302
AYANA: Sorry. I'm not good
with all this, like...

22:24.303 --> 22:26.679
Yeah. -I don't get involved
in all this drama.

22:26.680 --> 22:30.266
Margarita feels like Claire
knocked off her design.

22:30.267 --> 22:32.727
I don't really feel that way
so much.

22:32.728 --> 22:36.606
<i>It's just a sideways ruching
 with... paired with pants.</i>

22:36.607 --> 22:38.482
We all do ruching at some point.

22:38.483 --> 22:39.442
AMY:
<i>Ja.</i>

22:39.443 --> 22:41.235
<i>Interpreting fashion</i>

22:41.236 --> 22:42.737
and being inspired by fashion

22:42.738 --> 22:45.907
<i>is an absolutely normal part
of the process.</i>

22:45.908 --> 22:48.534
<i>It's all very subjective.</i>

22:51.663 --> 22:55.625
It looks like it has to go
with kimono sleeve, right?

22:55.626 --> 22:57.919
BRANDON:
Yeah.

23:09.681 --> 23:13.059
KENYA: Am I the only person
on earth who eats, um...

23:13.060 --> 23:15.937
popcorn with hot sauce
with a spoon, like it's cereal?

23:15.938 --> 23:17.563
MARGARITA:
You're the first one I've met.

23:17.564 --> 23:20.733
Oh, I'm done.
This is the last of it.

23:20.734 --> 23:22.610
My print needs more blue in it.

23:22.611 --> 23:24.237
Thankfully, I have some

23:24.238 --> 23:25.696
<i>turquoise, teal dye.</i>

23:25.697 --> 23:26.989
And it looks so much better.

23:26.990 --> 23:28.616
That was a little bit of Jesus

23:28.617 --> 23:30.409
-helping me out.
-Mm-hmm.

23:30.410 --> 23:33.162
-Hi.
-Hey.

23:33.163 --> 23:34.413
-Hi again.
-Yes.

23:34.414 --> 23:36.457
-And it'll have a big old cuff.
-These are amazing.

23:36.458 --> 23:38.626
-Do you like this little jacket?
-I do.

23:38.627 --> 23:40.127
So, I want it to be reversible.

23:40.128 --> 23:42.630
-Hi, honey.
-It's beautiful!

23:42.631 --> 23:44.799
It is gorgeous.

23:44.800 --> 23:47.510
-Thank you.
-Oh, no. Thank you.

23:47.511 --> 23:49.846
One of the things for me was
I didn't want

23:49.847 --> 23:52.723
<i>a matronly look,
</i> nbut I didn't want a young girl.

23:52.724 --> 23:54.183
She truly gets me.

23:54.184 --> 23:55.184
I love the print.

23:55.185 --> 23:56.561
I've adopted her, and she'll be

23:56.562 --> 23:59.647
coming for Thanksgiving
with us. (laughs)

23:59.648 --> 24:00.481
That's hot.

24:00.482 --> 24:01.816
-Do you like it?
-Yeah.

24:01.817 --> 24:03.484
AYANA: Oh, you're kind of
wearing pants right now.

24:03.485 --> 24:04.986
-Yeah.
-That gives us an idea.

24:04.987 --> 24:06.988
CECILIA: Like, I kind of
want to cry. -Oh, good.

24:06.989 --> 24:08.656
-This is fabulous.
-Oh, good!

24:08.657 --> 24:10.491
(indistinct chatter)

24:10.492 --> 24:12.159
What a lively room.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.453
As you know,
this is our critique,

24:14.454 --> 24:15.496
but for our clients, I want you

24:15.497 --> 24:17.206
to think of this
as a coaching session.

24:17.207 --> 24:20.459
We can do that. You can do
that. -You are helping coach

24:20.460 --> 24:21.669
your designer to $25,000.

24:21.670 --> 24:24.422
-Oh, my gosh. -Yeah.
-TIM: All right?

24:24.423 --> 24:26.799
-Let's go.
-Awesome.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.676
-Kentaro, Kekina.
-Hi.

24:28.677 --> 24:30.636
So, how has
your collaboration been?

24:30.637 --> 24:31.846
-It's been good.
-Good.

24:31.847 --> 24:34.807
She wanted to make a dress
for her friend's wedding,

24:34.808 --> 24:37.894
so I wanted to make
something flowy.

24:37.895 --> 24:41.731
And you have. But I wouldn't
know that this is your design.

24:41.732 --> 24:43.649
Is there enough of you in this?

24:43.650 --> 24:45.067
What do you mean?

24:45.068 --> 24:48.237
Well, it just looks
like a slip dress.

24:51.658 --> 24:52.950
Kekina, how do you feel?

24:52.951 --> 24:55.870
I feel it's simple
for a wedding.

24:55.871 --> 24:58.497
-Too simple?
-Yeah.

24:58.498 --> 25:01.417
It's not what I would call
an innovation.

25:02.044 --> 25:03.794
What do you think
of the print, though?

25:03.795 --> 25:04.837
-Do you like it?
-Ooh.

25:04.838 --> 25:07.131
I like the print.
It came out nice. -Yeah.

25:07.132 --> 25:08.508
I'm butting in.
I like the print, too.

25:08.509 --> 25:10.176
How did you come up
with a garment design?

25:10.177 --> 25:13.596
Well, she told me that she likes
wrap-style dresses,

25:13.597 --> 25:15.014
so I'm giving her the option

25:15.015 --> 25:18.392
of either having a skirt--
like a dress--

25:18.393 --> 25:20.895
or like a jumpsuit that wraps.

25:20.896 --> 25:22.688
The jumper
is kind of like pulling

25:22.689 --> 25:24.440
-at my heartstrings right now.
-Okay.

25:24.441 --> 25:25.358
-TIM: Okay.
-Yeah.

25:25.359 --> 25:27.401
-This is about winning.
-MICHAEL: Yeah.

25:27.402 --> 25:29.737
It can't just be a plain pant

25:29.738 --> 25:32.490
that Halona could go out
and buy already. -Yes. Yeah.

25:32.491 --> 25:33.991
I look at the top,
I know it's you.

25:33.992 --> 25:35.409
-It has your signature.
-Right.

25:35.410 --> 25:38.246
I look at the skirt,
and Analyssa could have

25:38.247 --> 25:40.039
bought it from
any number of people.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.582
AMY:
So I'm doing like a jacket.

25:41.583 --> 25:43.960
Black blouse, and then the pants
also in the print.

25:43.961 --> 25:46.504
TIM:
Given how great the shirt is,

25:46.505 --> 25:48.297
what if it's a shirt
and a pair of pants?

25:48.298 --> 25:50.675
-She's in love with the shirt.
-I'm in love with the shirt.

25:50.676 --> 25:51.968
-Like, for real.
-Then let's show it off.

25:51.969 --> 25:54.095
Yeah. -Okay. -The main
thing we're doing is...

25:54.096 --> 25:56.973
a dress, and then we're still
deciding on pants.

25:56.974 --> 25:59.725
I think the pants beg
the question, "Why?"

25:59.726 --> 26:02.478
We want some skin.
Look at her legs. Fab.

26:02.479 --> 26:03.896
I'm just kidding. (chuckles)

26:03.897 --> 26:05.857
I want to represent
the modest fashion that I do,

26:05.858 --> 26:08.943
<i>but at the same time,
 I'm not gonna put my client</i>

26:08.944 --> 26:11.779
in something that she's not
comfortable and happy with.

26:11.780 --> 26:12.780
So, no pants.

26:12.781 --> 26:13.990
o, no, we'll scrap 'em.
-Yes.

26:13.991 --> 26:16.868
The tone of this
is definitely more yellow

26:16.869 --> 26:18.953
than the blue I had anticipated.

26:18.954 --> 26:21.956
So I was quick on my feet
to go dye it. -TIM: Oh.

26:21.957 --> 26:24.000
-STACEY: Isn't that pretty?
-Actually, that's a hit.

26:24.001 --> 26:25.543
-Right? So much better.
-Right. -Yeah, love it.

26:25.544 --> 26:28.129
And then I have this jacket
that she can throw on

26:28.130 --> 26:30.548
-over this dress.
-I love this color gray.

26:30.549 --> 26:32.633
-I do, too. It's sophisticated.
-She does. She's...

26:32.634 --> 26:34.510
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Oh, good. That's a good word.

26:34.511 --> 26:35.970
It's not as hideous
as I expected.

26:35.971 --> 26:37.889
<i>Hopefully, it'll all come
 together tomorrow,</i>

26:37.890 --> 26:40.141
and she'll feel really fabulous.

26:40.142 --> 26:41.267
Thank you.

26:41.268 --> 26:42.310
-Good.
-All right.

26:42.311 --> 26:43.853
-He doesn't hate it.
-(laughs)

26:43.854 --> 26:45.688
Sabrina is a cancer survivor,

26:45.689 --> 26:48.191
and she wants more color
in her life.

26:48.192 --> 26:50.359
And so this is
what I've been working on.

26:50.360 --> 26:51.861
This is the print
I came up with.

26:51.862 --> 26:53.321
Where is the print?

26:53.322 --> 26:54.780
I'm going to put it here,

26:54.781 --> 26:57.617
here and some in the back.

26:58.160 --> 27:03.831
My initial response when I hear
that Sabrina wants color:

27:03.832 --> 27:05.208
Where is it?

27:06.627 --> 27:10.296
It's just... a gray shroud.

27:11.089 --> 27:15.843
SABRINA:This dress is something
 that I would wear at home.

27:15.844 --> 27:17.428
<i>It's not something that I want</i>

27:17.429 --> 27:19.138
to walk down the runway.

27:22.184 --> 27:24.560
HEIDI:
Coming up onProj just a gray s

27:24.561 --> 27:27.688
It doesn't have any oomph.

27:28.857 --> 27:31.859
And you want some oomph.

27:33.195 --> 27:34.070
He is correct

27:34.071 --> 27:35.404
<i>because, on the runway,</i>

27:35.405 --> 27:36.364
<i>it will not pop,</i>

27:36.365 --> 27:37.365
and I need it to pop.

27:37.366 --> 27:39.367
What do you think
about this color?

27:39.368 --> 27:40.535
SABRINA:
Oh, I haven't seen this yet.

27:40.536 --> 27:42.370
Yeah, I forgot to show you.

27:42.371 --> 27:44.247
TIM:
Well, you have some color.

27:44.248 --> 27:45.540
What did you not like about it?

27:45.541 --> 27:47.250
Maybe a little bit
of the texture.

27:47.251 --> 27:49.669
TIM: But it works.
What I care about

27:49.670 --> 27:51.003
is the runway impact.

27:51.004 --> 27:53.297
-Mm-hmm. Okay.
-And this color has much more

27:53.298 --> 27:55.174
-than what Sabrina has on.
-Okay.

27:55.175 --> 27:56.050
What else are you hiding?

27:56.051 --> 27:57.718
Nothing else. Nothing else.
(laughs)

27:57.719 --> 28:00.763
Kenya and Michele, I feel like
I'm interrupting a love fest.

28:00.764 --> 28:03.558
You are. You are.

28:03.559 --> 28:04.559
(laughing)

28:04.560 --> 28:06.894
-60. Fabulous.
-TIM: Yes.

28:06.895 --> 28:09.897
Grandma. Doesn't want
to look like a grandma. -No.

28:09.898 --> 28:12.233
No one does.
Or no one should.

28:12.234 --> 28:13.734
So, this is her top.

28:13.735 --> 28:16.612
But I'm going to cut it,
'cause I want the peplum piece

28:16.613 --> 28:19.448
to be, like, right at
the small of her waist.

28:19.449 --> 28:22.118
TIM: The peplum
doesn't look as though

28:22.119 --> 28:25.288
it's fully integrated
into the top.

28:26.957 --> 28:28.249
I feel bad for Kenya's model

28:28.250 --> 28:29.375
<i>because I think the peplum</i>

28:29.376 --> 28:31.294
<i>under the bust is just,
 honestly,</i>

28:31.295 --> 28:32.295
such a bad look.

28:32.296 --> 28:34.589
TIM:
It just feels like

28:34.590 --> 28:35.923
an add-on.

28:36.675 --> 28:40.469
What I'm going to do
is one leg of the print,

28:40.470 --> 28:45.725
the other leg
in the stretch black sateen.

28:45.726 --> 28:48.769
TIM: I just fear
that the one artwork leg

28:48.770 --> 28:50.980
-and the one black leg...
-CLAIRE: Mm-hmm.

28:50.981 --> 28:53.274
-It feels gimmicky.
-Okay.

28:53.275 --> 28:56.110
So, then, what I can do
is I can make

28:56.111 --> 28:57.737
-the entire top out of black.
-Yeah.

28:57.738 --> 29:00.239
CLAIRE: It's going to have
a peplum all the way around

29:00.240 --> 29:04.076
and have this open piece
right here. -Okay.

29:04.953 --> 29:06.787
-My comment would be...
-Mm-hmm.

29:06.788 --> 29:09.207
MARGARITA: <i>I want to hear
</i> what he's gonna say to Claire

29:09.208 --> 29:10.708
<i>because she's right
 in front of me.</i>

29:10.709 --> 29:12.126
It's the elephant in the room.

29:12.127 --> 29:14.378
-TIM: This top...
-CLAIRE: Mm-hmm.

29:14.379 --> 29:17.089
I've seen a similar version
of this before.

29:17.090 --> 29:19.592
-Okay.
-From you.

29:20.302 --> 29:23.763
And I just don't want the judges
to call this out and say,

29:23.764 --> 29:25.973
"Claire, we've seen this
before." -"We've seen this."

29:25.974 --> 29:28.601
-Sure.
-MARGARITA: <i>Really, Tim?</i>

29:28.602 --> 29:29.685
<i>Did you forget</i>

29:29.686 --> 29:31.229
that it was me who did it?

29:31.230 --> 29:33.689
Please say good-bye
to your clients.

29:33.690 --> 29:36.400
You will see them
in the morning.

29:36.401 --> 29:37.777
Kenya, you can let go
of Michele.

29:37.778 --> 29:40.446
-She'll be back.
-(laughing): Okay.

29:40.447 --> 29:42.573
-They're making me leave.
-Okay.

29:42.574 --> 29:43.533
Bye.

29:43.534 --> 29:44.992
All right.

29:44.993 --> 29:46.661
You have until 10:30 tonight.

29:46.662 --> 29:47.995
-Yes! -Oh!
-TIM: Work hard.

29:47.996 --> 29:50.831
I know you will. $25,000
is at stake. -(whooping)

29:50.832 --> 29:52.291
Of course you're going
to work hard.

29:52.292 --> 29:53.417
-All right.
-All right?

29:53.418 --> 29:54.669
-Bye, everybody.
-DESIGNERS: Bye.

29:54.670 --> 29:57.004
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

30:01.969 --> 30:04.262
Less volume here if you have
so much here, you know?

30:04.263 --> 30:06.681
Mm-hmm. -I think, like,
this is a little tighter.

30:06.682 --> 30:08.266
Tim said it's too simple, so...

30:08.267 --> 30:11.352
<i>I have to change my design
 a little bit</i>

30:11.353 --> 30:12.353
<i>to make it look better.</i>

30:12.354 --> 30:15.565
-So, bring everything up, yeah?
-Yeah.

30:17.025 --> 30:19.902
Margarita, I have a question
for you if you have...

30:19.903 --> 30:23.865
if you can look up for two
seconds when you have a second.

30:23.866 --> 30:27.702
<i>I actually think people
 in the workroom</i>

30:27.703 --> 30:29.495
<i>are interacting with me</i>

30:29.496 --> 30:30.538
a little less than they...

30:30.539 --> 30:32.206
than they used to
when Shawn was here.

30:32.207 --> 30:37.628
How do you feel about doing
sleeve where it's not connected?

30:37.629 --> 30:40.381
I don't hate it. (chuckles)

30:41.425 --> 30:42.175
<i>I miss</i>

30:42.176 --> 30:44.886
the camaraderie
that was more present,

30:44.887 --> 30:47.138
<i>and now it's...
 it's a little more tense.</i>

30:47.139 --> 30:48.848
It's a little more cold.

30:48.849 --> 30:53.394
How are you gonna make sure
it doesn't gape?

30:53.395 --> 30:54.812
Good question.

30:54.813 --> 30:57.273
AYANA:
<i>Everyone's kind of just like</i>

30:57.274 --> 30:58.316
whispering around.

30:58.317 --> 30:59.775
I'm sure Claire can feel it,

30:59.776 --> 31:01.152
but no one is saying anything

31:01.153 --> 31:03.905
<i>to her directly,
 which I think is an issue.</i>

31:03.906 --> 31:05.990
Is it something you can take off
if it doesn't work?

31:05.991 --> 31:07.825
Exactly.
<i>-I can't say anything.</i>

31:07.826 --> 31:09.243
I can't say anything,
'cause I'm gonna explode,

31:09.244 --> 31:11.412
and I don't want her
to feel attacked,

31:11.413 --> 31:13.414
but it's really (bleep)
with my focus.

31:13.415 --> 31:17.460
Why do I keep pinning this
the wrong way? Damn it.

31:18.003 --> 31:20.421
BATANI:Once I showed Tim
 my purple fabrics,

31:20.422 --> 31:21.756
it was like, "Here's color."

31:21.757 --> 31:23.382
<i>Now I'm just trying
to figure out</i>

31:23.383 --> 31:25.009
<i>where to put the print.</i>

31:32.893 --> 31:36.103
No, it's a huge deal.
I mean, $25,000...

31:36.104 --> 31:38.064
That's more than I-I make

31:38.065 --> 31:39.690
basically in a whole year
almost.

31:39.691 --> 31:41.400
I made, like...

31:54.248 --> 31:57.124
She hides it pretty well.

32:02.714 --> 32:03.756
No.

32:03.757 --> 32:05.007
<i>I feel very strongly</i>

32:05.008 --> 32:06.884
about fairness
in the competition,

32:06.885 --> 32:09.303
<i>and the fact that Claire
 isn't playing</i>

32:09.304 --> 32:13.349
the game right
really bothers me.

32:21.859 --> 32:23.317
Do you still have hella
to finish?

32:23.318 --> 32:25.903
Uh, I gotta put a hem
on the skirt.

32:25.904 --> 32:28.573
AYANA:Kenya's fireflies
 are really cute.

32:28.574 --> 32:29.657
<i>Judges will either love it</i>

32:29.658 --> 32:31.826
because she's put, like,
an older lady

32:31.827 --> 32:33.661
<i>in something that fun,</i>

32:33.662 --> 32:35.329
or they will completely hate it.

32:36.790 --> 32:38.416
AMY:
That's a cute top, Claire.

32:38.417 --> 32:39.167
Thank you.

32:39.168 --> 32:41.002
I'm actually pleased with it.

32:41.003 --> 32:42.879
-For once.
-Good place to be.

32:42.880 --> 32:44.839
CLAIRE:
<i>I really agree with</i>

32:44.840 --> 32:46.465
Tim's advice and...

32:46.466 --> 32:47.758
<i>changed the top.</i>

32:47.759 --> 32:48.759
<i>I'm taking the</i>

32:48.760 --> 32:50.011
keyhole accent and putting it

32:50.012 --> 32:54.682
<i>in the front and the back,
 as well as on the sleeves.</i>

32:54.683 --> 32:56.058
(Margarita sighs)

32:58.854 --> 32:59.854
I keep making mistakes.

32:59.855 --> 33:01.480
<i>I keep cutting
 the gray fabric wrong.</i>

33:01.481 --> 33:03.524
I mean, it's really
(bleep) with me.

33:10.991 --> 33:13.534
<i>Oh, my God! I, like,
 don't have enough gray fabric.</i>

33:13.535 --> 33:15.161
So I'm like, "Well,
how am I gonna fix this?"

33:15.162 --> 33:18.623
<i>I have to, like,
 use a hot-pink fuchsia.</i>

33:18.624 --> 33:19.999
Like, Jesus, please help me.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.793
All right, everybody,
I'm sleepy.

33:22.794 --> 33:25.129
DESIGNERS:
No!

33:25.839 --> 33:28.049
MARGARITA:
I'm just feeling so defeated.

HEIDI:
Coming up onProj

33:35.557 --> 33:38.893
KENYA:Winning this challenge
 is everything.

33:38.894 --> 33:41.270
The struggle
as an independent designer

33:41.271 --> 33:43.231
<i>is really real.</i>

33:43.232 --> 33:45.983
<i>I've been evicted two times.</i>

33:45.984 --> 33:47.401
<i>My credit sucks.</i>

33:47.402 --> 33:48.694
<i>So $25,000</i>

33:48.695 --> 33:52.240
in my life is life-changing.

33:56.119 --> 33:57.453
AMY:
How you doing, Margarita?

33:57.454 --> 34:00.456
Well, I have mixed emotions.

34:00.457 --> 34:02.416
-Yeah?
-It's just one roadblock

34:02.417 --> 34:03.751
after the next, you know?

34:03.752 --> 34:07.505
<i>I'm so ashamed of what
 I put together for Stacey.</i>

34:07.506 --> 34:09.297
<i>When she walks in today
 and sees</i>

34:09.299 --> 34:11.467
that I couldn't finish the gray

34:11.467 --> 34:13.344
because I didn't have
enough fabric,

34:13.344 --> 34:15.513
she is going to kill me.

34:15.514 --> 34:18.516
I did not anticipate
any of this.

34:18.516 --> 34:20.726
It literally looks
like a Barney outfit.

34:20.726 --> 34:21.853

CLAIRE: <i>I'm excited

34:31.612 --> 34:33.114

Anyone in the Brother Sewing
and Embroidery Studio?

34:40.246 --> 34:41.371
Please come in

-Okay.

34:48.130 --> 34:50.715

-Hello.

I need you to try this on

Oh, my God, they fit perfectly.

So, the gray ended up
not working

35:39.223 --> 35:41.682
'cause I didn't have
enough of it. -Oh, no.

35:41.683 --> 35:44.519
And I was like, "We'll just
have to go with the fuchsia."

35:44.520 --> 35:45.895
I saw her face.
Just, like,

<i>worse than the face she saw</i>

35:46.939 --> 35:48.147

46:17.653 --> 46:18.819
HEIDI:
I have to say,

46:18.820 --> 46:20.488
I'm very confused
when I see this look.

46:20.489 --> 46:25.409
From the neck up,
I see a very polished,

46:25.410 --> 46:26.494
put-together woman,

46:26.495 --> 46:29.872
and then from the neck down,
I'm seeing Coachella.

46:29.873 --> 46:33.918
Or I'm seeing hippie-dippy,
someone who's like, "Whoo..."

46:33.919 --> 46:36.379
The makeup and hair is not me.

46:36.380 --> 46:39.215
This is more me. -Obviously,
you wanted to do what she...

46:39.216 --> 46:41.467
She listened to what I asked
her to do. -Yeah, exactly.

46:41.468 --> 46:43.135
HEIDI: I don't know.
You can't just be like,

46:43.136 --> 46:45.054
"Well, this is what she wanted,
and there it is."

46:45.055 --> 46:46.389
SOPHIA: The purple
looks beautiful on you,

46:46.390 --> 46:49.934
but asymmetrical hemline,
asymmetrical belt.

46:49.935 --> 46:52.395
Then the vest--
just, nothing is balanced.

46:52.396 --> 46:54.355
The placement of the print
is weird.

46:54.356 --> 46:56.482
-Can you turn around?
-ZAC: Womp, womp.

46:56.483 --> 46:58.234
NINA:
Like, what is that stripe?

46:58.235 --> 47:01.362
And then that side's
like an afterthought.

47:01.363 --> 47:05.116
This was a print challenge.

47:05.742 --> 47:06.993
That's what it was.

47:06.994 --> 47:08.536
This was your challenge.

47:08.537 --> 47:11.414
-Big missed opportunity.
-HEIDI: Michael.

47:11.415 --> 47:14.750
She mentioned that she does have
Native American roots,

47:14.751 --> 47:16.961
so we both agreed
on a color palette

47:16.962 --> 47:18.129
of orange and blues.

47:18.130 --> 47:21.424
As far as design,
I created kind of a blanket--

47:21.425 --> 47:22.550
Native American wrap style.

47:22.551 --> 47:23.885
Halona,
how do you like your look?

47:23.886 --> 47:26.095
It's beautiful.
I love my blouse the most

47:26.096 --> 47:28.055
-'cause of the print.
-ZAC: I think your model

47:28.056 --> 47:29.307
did a terrific job.

47:29.308 --> 47:33.269
I am pretty disappointed
with this from you.

47:33.270 --> 47:37.106
NINA: You had a very
ambitious design, but...

47:37.107 --> 47:39.233
there's too much going on,
and you didn't

47:39.234 --> 47:41.903
take into consideration
her proportions.

47:41.904 --> 47:45.198
These pants need somebody
quite tall.

47:45.199 --> 47:48.367
I got immediately what you were
trying to do with the print,

47:48.368 --> 47:51.204
but I didn't like
the openings on the sleeve.

47:51.205 --> 47:52.788
It's just a lot.

47:52.789 --> 47:55.082
Kenya, tell us about your look,

47:55.083 --> 47:57.251
your client
and what your client wanted.

47:57.252 --> 47:58.836
Michele is 60.
She's a grandmother

47:58.837 --> 48:01.422
who doesn't want to look
like a grandmother.

48:01.423 --> 48:04.050
She wants something nice,
sophisticated.

48:04.051 --> 48:07.220
And the top was inspired
by Dixie.

48:07.221 --> 48:10.181
I think that would be really,
really cute on a cup.

48:10.182 --> 48:13.434
And I think
that I made her happy.

48:13.435 --> 48:14.519
Well, she made me happy.

48:14.520 --> 48:18.147
Yeah, she just made me feel
really good with her design.

48:18.148 --> 48:22.276
Kenya, you certainly know
how to whip up a blouse.

48:22.277 --> 48:25.613
You keep giving us beautiful,
beautiful tops,

48:25.614 --> 48:26.864
and this one is no exception.

48:26.865 --> 48:28.115
YOLANDA:
I love the color.

48:28.116 --> 48:30.618
I love the print. It's small.

48:30.619 --> 48:32.119
I'm not a big print person.

48:32.120 --> 48:33.621
It's elegant. It's classy.

48:33.622 --> 48:35.790
ZAC:
The detailing throughout

48:35.791 --> 48:38.709
is exceptional--
really beautiful work.

48:38.710 --> 48:40.628
And she's happy.
However...

48:40.629 --> 48:43.881
this kind of
peplum empire thing--

48:43.882 --> 48:46.217
-I've seen it a lot from you.
-Okay.

48:46.218 --> 48:49.136
I think to do a peplum
right under the chest...

48:49.137 --> 48:50.972
(clicks tongue)
does not look good.

48:50.973 --> 48:52.932
ZAC: It makes her
very short-waisted.

48:52.933 --> 48:54.809
HEIDI:
Also, the skirt

48:54.810 --> 48:55.977
is too tight.

48:55.978 --> 48:58.145
I was not a fan today, Kenya.

48:58.146 --> 48:59.730
But she feels good in it,

48:59.731 --> 49:01.566
so who cares
what the judges think?

49:01.567 --> 49:03.693
-But you should.
-(light laughter)

49:03.694 --> 49:06.112
Thank you, Kenya.
Kentaro.

49:06.113 --> 49:10.241
She asked me to make a dress
for her Indian friend's wedding.

49:10.242 --> 49:12.451
She was inspiring me
about Indian culture,

49:12.452 --> 49:15.162
how they use, like,
different bright colors,

49:15.163 --> 49:18.165
so this was first time
I went for color color.

49:18.166 --> 49:20.084
Ever or in the competition?

49:20.085 --> 49:22.420
No, ever.
I feel like I became

49:22.421 --> 49:24.130
a new designer a little bit.

49:24.131 --> 49:26.174
This is sublime.

49:26.175 --> 49:28.968
The movement.
Color is your friend.

49:28.969 --> 49:32.180
<i>These colors just sang
 down that runway.</i>

49:32.181 --> 49:34.348
<i>The print is effective.</i>

49:34.349 --> 49:35.725
The finishing.

49:35.726 --> 49:37.226
The whole thing.

49:37.227 --> 49:39.687
-I'm blown away by this.
-Thank you.

49:39.688 --> 49:41.856
I agree with Zac,
but only on the color.

49:41.857 --> 49:45.860
Here you have a woman
who couldn't be more petite,

49:45.861 --> 49:49.655
and you're drowning her
in 20 yards of fabric.

49:49.656 --> 49:52.074
-(scoffs)
-Where is she in there?

49:52.075 --> 49:53.784
ZAC:
No, this is beautiful.

49:53.785 --> 49:56.078
-Yeah, gorge'.
-ZAC: Divine.

49:56.079 --> 49:58.247
It is 360-degree elegance here.

49:58.248 --> 50:01.792
In every turn she makes,
this dress is stunning.

50:01.793 --> 50:04.670
It just really knocked me
off my feet.

50:04.671 --> 50:09.509
Kentaro, really, when I see
a designer on <i>Project Runway</i>

50:09.510 --> 50:12.053
really grow in front
of our eyes,

50:12.054 --> 50:15.097
I am so proud of you.

50:15.474 --> 50:16.224
HEIDI:
Claire.

50:16.225 --> 50:18.226
This is my stunning model,
Cecilia.

50:18.227 --> 50:20.061
And one of the first things
she tells me

50:20.062 --> 50:22.563
is that she really doesn't
favor prints.

50:22.564 --> 50:25.233
So I had a little
mini heart attack.

50:25.234 --> 50:26.567
CECILIA:
I was so nervous

50:26.568 --> 50:28.319
when I heard that it
was a print challenge,

50:28.320 --> 50:33.574
and she created something
that I would want in my closet.

50:33.575 --> 50:35.243
-I love this.
-HEIDI: Claire, I have to ask,

50:35.244 --> 50:36.869
this was your first challenge

50:36.870 --> 50:39.664
without your sister here.
How was that?

50:39.665 --> 50:41.415
It was certainly a challenge.

50:41.416 --> 50:44.877
I used Shawn as a sounding board
and as a source of comfort.

50:44.878 --> 50:48.798
So, what I've been pretending
is that she's still here with me

50:48.799 --> 50:53.427
and I can be resilient
and make things happen.

50:53.428 --> 50:56.180
I personally think it must have
been a good thing.

50:56.181 --> 50:57.849
-CLAIRE: Well, there we go.
-Because, when I'm looking

50:57.850 --> 51:00.810
at Cecilia today,
I think she looks perfect

51:00.811 --> 51:02.937
-head-to-toe.
-Thank you so much.

51:02.938 --> 51:04.772
To me, this is
a woman on the go.

51:04.773 --> 51:08.985
You gave her a great pair
of pants with a great print.

51:08.986 --> 51:10.736
It looks very chic
and very modern.

51:10.737 --> 51:12.530
ZAC:
When it came down the runway,

51:12.531 --> 51:14.615
<i>immediately I thought,
 "This was</i>

51:14.616 --> 51:18.119
-the effective print."
-NINA: I love a graphic print,

51:18.120 --> 51:20.454
and what I loved most
about this print

51:20.455 --> 51:23.541
was trying to imagine it
on a Dixie cup. -CLAIRE: Mm-hmm.

51:23.542 --> 51:25.668
NINA: Because, if it
were on a Dixie cup,

51:25.669 --> 51:27.795
I would want to have
that Dixie cup.

51:27.796 --> 51:29.463
-(laughter)
-So... Yeah. -That's good.

51:29.464 --> 51:30.798
NINA:
That really worked.

51:30.799 --> 51:33.342
I don't have a lot of pattern
in my closet, either,

51:33.343 --> 51:36.304
and I would actually wear
this piece even on its own.

51:36.305 --> 51:38.431
Like, I would wear the pants
with a cute crop top, or...

51:38.432 --> 51:41.100
I could wear the top with a cute
pair of jeans and heels.

51:41.101 --> 51:43.311
HEIDI: There is so much
detail to this top.

51:43.312 --> 51:44.645
It's nice to have these slits

51:44.646 --> 51:46.480
to see a little skin
coming through.

51:46.481 --> 51:49.525
NINA: I think,
in terms of the design,

51:49.526 --> 51:52.570
am I blown away?
Have I never seen this before?

51:52.571 --> 51:55.740
No, I have seen
a version of this.

51:55.741 --> 51:57.325
But it's suitable
for your model.

51:57.326 --> 52:00.745
She feels very comfortable,
and I think many women would.

52:00.746 --> 52:02.997
ZAC:
The top looks polished and,

52:02.998 --> 52:05.958
you know, ready to buy,
but I think you have

52:05.959 --> 52:07.835
more creativity in you.

52:08.462 --> 52:09.795
Sure.

52:09.796 --> 52:12.340
Margarita, tell us about
your look, your print,

52:12.341 --> 52:13.883
and what your client wanted.

52:13.884 --> 52:15.927
MARGARITA:
Stacey travels a lot.

52:15.928 --> 52:17.470
She's a woman on the go.

52:17.471 --> 52:19.180
She doesn't really wear
a lot of color,

52:19.181 --> 52:20.681
but she wanted
something that would

52:20.682 --> 52:22.266
brighten up her wardrobe.

52:22.267 --> 52:23.684
I did not anticipate

52:23.685 --> 52:26.604
that the print color and scale
would come

52:26.605 --> 52:29.690
in the way that it did,
and I ran out of fabric.

52:29.691 --> 52:31.692
It was just a snowball effect.

52:31.693 --> 52:34.737
She's been amazing to work with,
and I promised her I would

52:34.738 --> 52:36.364
make her a better one
after this.

52:36.365 --> 52:38.407
-(laughter)
-MARGARITA: You know?

52:38.408 --> 52:40.034
Stacey, how do you feel
in your look?

52:40.035 --> 52:43.454
I feel like she
is a long-distance runner.

52:43.455 --> 52:46.040
She rallied.
She had great vision.

52:46.041 --> 52:48.042
She was just fabulous.

52:48.043 --> 52:51.921
What most confuses me--
the dress looks like

52:51.922 --> 52:56.133
she's a preppy lady
going to Martha's Vineyard,

52:56.134 --> 52:58.135
and then the top
looks like she's going

52:58.136 --> 53:00.263
to a cocktail party in the city.

53:00.264 --> 53:02.348
They have no connection
whatsoever.

53:02.349 --> 53:05.101
-I got lost.
-It is... Yes.

53:05.102 --> 53:07.395
YOLANDA:
I do like pink with gray, but I

53:07.396 --> 53:08.729
would have rather seen the dress

53:08.730 --> 53:10.982
with a pair of flip-flops
and a beach bag.

53:10.983 --> 53:14.360
ZAC:
I actually like your print.

53:15.028 --> 53:16.571
That's about it.

53:16.572 --> 53:17.905
I understand.

53:17.906 --> 53:20.324
I expect a lot more from you.

53:21.034 --> 53:22.743
-What happened?
-(sighs)

53:22.744 --> 53:25.496
I put so much pressure
on myself,

53:25.497 --> 53:28.165
and I got distracted
from everything else

53:28.166 --> 53:30.168
that was going on
in the workroom

53:30.169 --> 53:32.378
and just lost my focus, so...

53:33.714 --> 53:37.383
Margarita, what was
so distracting in the workroom?

53:37.384 --> 53:39.135
(sighs)

53:39.136 --> 53:40.553
I don't know why I let

53:40.554 --> 53:42.430
the outside get to me,
but I did.

53:42.431 --> 53:44.432
We want to know-- what happened?

53:44.433 --> 53:48.227
No? You're not gonna tell me?

53:48.812 --> 53:52.398
I wasn't raised to throw people
under the bus, so...

53:52.399 --> 53:54.442
I'm just gonna...

53:54.443 --> 53:55.443
Hmm.

53:55.444 --> 53:57.111
Thank you, Stacey.

53:57.112 --> 53:58.613
Thank you, Margarita.

53:58.614 --> 53:59.780
Thank you, guys.

53:59.781 --> 54:02.491
HEIDI: Okay, we've heard
what you had to say.

54:02.492 --> 54:04.577
We're going to take
a closer look at your designs,

54:04.578 --> 54:06.662
have a little chat,
and then I'll call you back

54:06.663 --> 54:09.040
onto the runway.
Thank you.

54:10.542 --> 54:13.294
Hey, guys. He's smiling,
so he's in the top. -Top. Top.

54:13.295 --> 54:14.754
-Claire? Top.
-Top.

54:14.755 --> 54:18.132
-AYANA: Spill the beans.
-CLAIRE: They thought that it

54:18.133 --> 54:20.551
was a very nice use
of the print itself,

54:20.552 --> 54:23.346
that I incorporated it well
into the design.

54:23.347 --> 54:25.473
Which I thought I did. Um...

54:25.474 --> 54:27.016
Well, it's a wearable pair
of pants. You know, it's

54:27.017 --> 54:29.477
a black and white print
pair of pants. -CLAIRE: Exactly.

54:29.478 --> 54:31.020
One of the things that I find
the most difficult--

54:31.021 --> 54:33.814
and this is no shade,
you know, truthfully--

54:33.815 --> 54:36.567
but they say it's ready to buy,

54:36.568 --> 54:39.570
and they see a lack
of originality,

54:39.571 --> 54:40.738
yet they praise it.

54:40.739 --> 54:42.615
CLAIRE: Well, a lot of
people look good

54:42.616 --> 54:46.494
in very clean, sleek,
sophisticated shapes.

54:46.495 --> 54:47.828
That's where I saw
the confusion--

54:47.829 --> 54:49.914
because, ultimately,
I feel like you could

54:49.915 --> 54:53.209
find those two pieces
in J.Crew, you know?

54:53.210 --> 54:55.211
What did they say to you,
Margarita?

54:55.212 --> 54:57.463
They were like, "What happened?"
And I was like,

54:57.464 --> 54:58.881
"I was not raised
to throw people

54:58.882 --> 55:01.342
under the bus," is what I said.

55:01.343 --> 55:02.176
I hear you.

55:02.177 --> 55:04.512
MARGARITA:
<i>I'm so pissed.</i>

55:04.513 --> 55:05.555
Claire's at the top.

55:05.556 --> 55:07.181
Like, of course
she's at the top.

55:07.182 --> 55:09.016
<i>This is so unfair.</i>

55:09.017 --> 55:11.769
It was just a bad day.

55:16.942 --> 55:18.651
HEIDI: <i>The winner
 of</i> Project Runwaywill receive

55:18.652 --> 55:20.236
