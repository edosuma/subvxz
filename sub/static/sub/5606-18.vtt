I've been here for years.

00:19.386 --> 00:20.885
Well, pump your brakes
there, Mulder.

00:20.887 --> 00:22.387
She's not official Five-O.

00:22.389 --> 00:23.488
We're just swearing her in

00:23.490 --> 00:24.522
on a temporary basis

00:24.524 --> 00:25.824
'cause she's shadowing us

00:25.826 --> 00:27.876

that's all.

00:35.302 --> 00:36.868
STEVE: Yeah.
Who is he?

00:36.870 --> 00:38.536
CHIN: Rex Coughlin
was an IA detective

00:38.538 --> 00:40.872
who investigated me
a few years back.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.273
If it is an investigation,

00:42.275 --> 00:43.608
Robert's gonna have people
working for him.

00:43.610 --> 00:45.276
I've been under for months now,

00:45.278 --> 00:46.878
and I haven't seen anything

00:46.880 --> 00:49.414
to warrant disbanding
to indicting members of Five-O.

COUGHLIN:<i> Are you sure your</i>

00:51.184 --> 00:53.017

00:53.019 --> 00:55.153
<i>You're gonna go back to Five-O,</i>

00:55.155 --> 00:58.556
<i> and you will stay under</i>
<i> until you get something.</i>

00:58.558 --> 01:00.024
Is that clear?

01:00.026 --> 01:01.025
CHIN:<i> Left you</i>

01:01.027 --> 01:02.293

01:03.563 --> 01:05.997
Chin, there's something
I need to tell you.

Are you upset because I made you
leave your phone in the car?

03:12.392 --> 03:13.758
We had a deal-- we agreed

03:13.760 --> 03:16.627
that this would be
a no-phone zone, right?

03:16.629 --> 03:18.363
Nice family time, right?

03:18.365 --> 03:20.298
I didn't agree.
Oh.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.300
I don't understand,
what's so good about your phone

03:22.302 --> 03:24.168
that you'd rather sit
staring at your phone

03:24.170 --> 03:25.636
than having these moments
with us?

03:25.638 --> 03:26.738
This is
a father-daughter moment.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.456
We should cherish this.

03:28.457 --> 03:30.173
Well, that's why I need it--
to Instagram the moment

03:30.176 --> 03:32.110

03:32.111 --> 03:34.045
Oh, preser... See, 'cause,
listen, when I was a kid,

03:34.047 --> 03:35.380
I didn't even have a phone,

03:35.382 --> 03:38.182

I still have

03:38.184 --> 03:40.118
vivid memories.

03:40.119 --> 03:42.053
You know, the brain does a lot
of very interesting things.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.122
You know, remembering stuff
is one of the things it does.

03:44.124 --> 03:45.323
You should give it
a shot sometime.

03:45.325 --> 03:47.458
Moani Rose says
if it's not Instagrammed,

03:47.460 --> 03:48.726
how do you know
if it happened?

03:48.728 --> 03:49.727
Huh.

03:49.729 --> 03:52.030
Is this Moani, uh,
a philosopher?

03:52.032 --> 03:54.198
No, she's in my jazz tap class.

they stare at their phone.

04:02.108 --> 04:03.508
They go to a movie theater,
they stare at their phone.

04:03.510 --> 04:05.376
You know, if you picked
your head up out of your phone

04:05.378 --> 04:07.078
every once in a while,
you might see

04:07.079 --> 04:08.779

04:41.414 --> 04:43.247
I don't think it's, uh, magic.

04:43.249 --> 04:44.549

Daddy's car.

Wow, that sucks.

<i> Where were they found?</i>

08:57.370 --> 09:00.371
Makaha Beach. Two men were
clinging to a floatation device.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.640
One of them was dead
with a gunshot wound.

09:02.642 --> 09:03.775
The other one's in ICU.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.209
When they pulled him
out of the water,

09:05.211 --> 09:06.544
they found a revolver
on him.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.146
And we don't think
that's the shooter?

09:08.148 --> 09:09.481
No, ballistics weren't a match.

09:09.483 --> 09:11.816
All right, I'll check in
with the Coast Guard,

09:11.818 --> 09:13.284
see if they had
any distress calls

09:13.286 --> 09:15.286
or shipwrecks
in the past couple of days.

09:15.288 --> 09:17.155
Guys had to come from somewhere.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.673
Right.

09:18.674 --> 09:20.190
Although our victim sustained
a gunshot wound,

09:20.193 --> 09:23.094
cause of death
was ventricular fibrillation--

09:23.096 --> 09:25.163
cardiac arrest--
as a result of hypothermia

09:25.165 --> 09:26.498
within the last 24 hours.

09:26.500 --> 09:27.832
Hmm.

09:27.834 --> 09:28.967
Any idea who he is?

09:28.969 --> 09:30.101
Based on prints,

09:30.103 --> 09:31.503
I was able to establish
our victim's name

09:31.505 --> 09:33.438
is Somchai Wattana.

09:33.440 --> 09:36.007
However, according to
Thai government reports...

09:38.278 --> 09:40.211
...our victim was
executed by firing squad

09:40.213 --> 09:42.213
at Bang Kwang Central Prison

09:42.215 --> 09:44.415
in June, 2009,

09:44.417 --> 09:46.251
on drug trafficking charges.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.854
That's over six years ago.

09:49.856 --> 09:51.456
How is that possible?

09:51.458 --> 09:53.792
I don't know, but apparently,

09:53.794 --> 09:56.261
this isn't the first time
our victim has died.

10:06.072 --> 10:07.138
GRACE:
Why can't we just use

10:07.140 --> 10:09.107
the restaurant's phone
and call a cab?

10:09.109 --> 10:10.275
You got $1,000?

10:10.277 --> 10:11.910
That's what it would cost

10:11.912 --> 10:14.179
taking a cab back into town,
all right? With the traffic.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.281
We're in the middle

10:16.283 --> 10:17.849

What about Uncle Steve?

10:19.252 --> 10:20.819
Maybe he can come pick us up.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.253
You always talk
about how much

10:22.255 --> 10:23.855
he loves driving.
No.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.523
We don't need to bother
Uncle Steve with this.

10:25.525 --> 10:27.458
More importantly, Uncle Steve
does not need to know

10:27.460 --> 10:29.294
that this happened to
my car ever.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.129
You understand?
Besides, this is good.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.564
It's good for both of you.

10:32.566 --> 10:34.833
You know? When I was a kid,
I rode the bus all the time.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.067
It's good for you.
It's character-building.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.168
Know what I mean?

10:37.170 --> 10:38.503
It's good for the environment.

10:38.505 --> 10:40.505
You sit on a bus, you relax,

10:40.507 --> 10:41.973
maybe read a book,

10:41.975 --> 10:45.543
meet... interesting
people and...

10:45.545 --> 10:47.078

10:53.186 --> 10:55.320
Come on, buddy.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.224
Detective Williams!

10:59.226 --> 11:00.892
Hey, Mamo.
Howzit?

11:00.894 --> 11:01.893
What's up, buddy? How you doing?
Long time!

11:01.895 --> 11:03.562
Yeah. Good to see you.

11:03.563 --> 11:05.230
What happened to that
nice car of yours?

11:06.900 --> 11:09.200
Uh, that's a...
that's a very good question.

11:09.202 --> 11:10.602
Uh, does this bus go to Waikiki?

11:10.604 --> 11:12.637
Last stop.

11:12.639 --> 11:14.639
Fantastic.
All right.

11:14.641 --> 11:15.640
Here you go, buddy.

11:15.642 --> 11:16.908
(laughs)

11:18.445 --> 11:21.646
MAMO:
Enjoy the ride, brah.

11:24.584 --> 11:26.451
See?

11:26.453 --> 11:27.652
Nice people.

11:30.924 --> 11:31.990
Hello.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.261
Maybe not him.

11:37.597 --> 11:39.330
See? This is gonna
be fun, right?

11:39.332 --> 11:40.598
Right?

11:40.600 --> 11:42.000
CHARLIE: Daddy, I think
I'm going to throw up.

11:42.002 --> 11:43.001
Don't do that. Huh?

11:43.003 --> 11:44.369
What's the matter
with you?

11:44.371 --> 11:45.436
GRACE (sarcastically):
<i> You're right.</i>

11:45.438 --> 11:48.206
<i> This is gonna be so much fun.</i>

11:50.143 --> 11:52.543
KONO:
<i> Here's what we know so far.</i>

11:52.545 --> 11:54.312
Our survivor
in the ICU

11:54.314 --> 11:55.947
is Edward Torres.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.181
Interpol Missing
Persons has

11:57.183 --> 11:59.684
a yellow notice out
on him from 2013.

11:59.686 --> 12:01.152
So I ran him
through the system,

12:01.154 --> 12:03.388
but unlike our
dead guy, Mr. Wattana,

12:03.390 --> 12:05.356
Torres has no record.

12:05.358 --> 12:06.357
He's a family man.

12:06.359 --> 12:07.492
Member of his
local church.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.227
If he's such a Boy Scout,

12:09.229 --> 12:12.363
what's he doing hanging out with
a death row felon like Wattana?

12:12.365 --> 12:13.364
I don't know.

12:13.366 --> 12:14.999
We reached out to his family,

12:15.001 --> 12:16.301
let them know
that he's been found.

12:16.303 --> 12:17.936
Maybe they can fill in
some of the blanks

12:17.938 --> 12:19.337
until he's well enough
to talk to us.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.105
I just hung up
with the Coast Guard.

12:21.107 --> 12:22.240
They have nothing.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.508
No distress calls,

12:23.510 --> 12:25.376
no shipwrecks within
the last 72 hours.

12:25.378 --> 12:28.112
Okay, so where did
these guys come from?

12:28.114 --> 12:30.148
Well, let's break this down.
We know they had a gun.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.650
We know somebody fired
at least once at them.

12:32.652 --> 12:33.985
We know they
went overboard.

12:33.987 --> 12:36.354
Maybe pirates hit the ship.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.589
Maybe-maybe it was
a drug deal gone bad.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.491
We know Wattana had narcotics
charges against him, right?

12:40.493 --> 12:42.593
Yeah, about that:

12:42.595 --> 12:44.329
I also spoke with the consulate.

12:44.331 --> 12:46.164
The Thai government
is sticking with their story.

12:46.166 --> 12:48.032
According to them,

12:48.034 --> 12:51.235
Wattana was executed at
Bang Kwang Prison in 2009

12:51.237 --> 12:53.338
and they ain't helping us with this.
(phones ringing)

12:56.409 --> 12:57.542
Well!

12:57.544 --> 13:00.011
Hold the front page.

13:00.013 --> 13:02.313
We got a Jerry Alert.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.115
Did you see the article
on hoaxposed

13:04.117 --> 13:05.516
about the Philae Lander?

13:05.518 --> 13:08.019
Billions of dollars
to land on a comet?

13:08.021 --> 13:09.020
I don't think so.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.021
What was it, then?

13:10.023 --> 13:11.490
An alien artifact.

13:11.492 --> 13:13.659
That makes so much more sense.

13:13.661 --> 13:14.726
MEREDITH: Right?

13:16.230 --> 13:17.429
STEVE:
Aloha.

13:17.430 --> 13:18.629
STEVE and GROVER: Say good-bye, Jerry.
JERRY: Gotta go.

13:18.632 --> 13:19.965
Later. Bye.

13:23.237 --> 13:24.470
MEREDITH: Bye.

13:24.471 --> 13:25.704
Sorry.
She just called. I just was...

13:28.809 --> 13:30.242
It's fine.

13:30.244 --> 13:31.777
I'm actually glad to see

13:31.779 --> 13:34.646
your little romance
is, uh, taking off.

13:34.648 --> 13:36.715
Oh, you know,
we're just keeping it casual.

13:38.519 --> 13:40.786
Uh, anyway,

13:40.788 --> 13:42.588
that floatation device

13:42.590 --> 13:44.656
that those men were
found clinging to...

13:44.658 --> 13:46.325
the boys in the lab
were able to clean it up

13:46.327 --> 13:47.659
and pull a serial number,

13:47.661 --> 13:48.927
which I ran through various

13:48.929 --> 13:50.729
maritime databases,
and it belongs

13:50.731 --> 13:52.531
to this ship.

13:52.533 --> 13:54.266
The<i> Sea Falcon.</i>

13:54.268 --> 13:55.934
When was that taken, Jerry?
1963.

13:55.936 --> 13:59.304
And here's where it gets
a little bit Stephen King.

13:59.306 --> 14:04.476
This was taken in 2005,
at the dry dock in Bangkok

14:04.478 --> 14:08.847
where the<i> Sea Falcon</i>
was decommissioned.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.315
GROVER:
Wait a second.

14:10.317 --> 14:11.583
You're telling me

14:11.585 --> 14:13.685
that this thing has been
in the boat graveyard

14:13.687 --> 14:15.420
for the last ten years?

14:15.422 --> 14:16.421
Ship-breaking,
as it's referred to,

14:16.423 --> 14:17.623
actually happens
at a scrap yard.

14:17.625 --> 14:18.824
But yes, I'm saying this boat's

14:18.826 --> 14:19.992
been out of commission
for ten years.

14:21.729 --> 14:23.028
So we got a ship
that doesn't exist

14:23.030 --> 14:24.863
and a vic that's been dead
for six years.

14:24.865 --> 14:27.966
Kind of makes sense,
though, doesn't it?

14:27.968 --> 14:30.335
Ghost crew, ghost ship...

14:31.839 --> 14:34.306
Let me break this to you:

14:34.308 --> 14:38.443
Ghosts and ghost ships
do not exist.

14:38.445 --> 14:41.380
I have to respectfully disagree.

14:41.382 --> 14:43.649
The<i> Marie Celeste, </i>
the<i> Flying Dutchman,</i>

14:43.651 --> 14:46.018
the S.S.<i> Valencia, </i>

14:46.020 --> 14:47.886
the<i> Baychimo,</i>
the<i> Octavius...</i>

14:47.888 --> 14:49.988
I could go on.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.456
Please don't.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.394
MAMO:
<i> Sure.</i>

14:55.396 --> 14:56.928
I've been a Waikiki
beach boy all my life,

14:56.930 --> 14:58.330
but when the waves
are flat in the winter,

14:58.332 --> 15:00.365
I drive this baby.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.601
I get to see the island,
meet new people.

15:02.603 --> 15:03.869
I love this bus life, brah.

15:03.871 --> 15:05.504
She may be old,

15:05.506 --> 15:06.938
but she runs like a Swiss watch.

15:06.940 --> 15:10.375
And no one keeps their ride
cleaner than me.

15:10.377 --> 15:11.860
I gotta tell you,
this is without question

15:11.861 --> 15:13.344
the cleanest bus I have
ever been on in my life.

15:13.347 --> 15:14.746
What are you doing?
Stop that.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.448
Stop that.
What are you, nuts?

15:16.450 --> 15:17.549
MAMO:
See, I go at it even after

15:17.551 --> 15:18.750
the clean-up crew
have done their work.

15:18.752 --> 15:22.521
Not everyone has
the same standard, you know.

15:22.523 --> 15:24.089
Listen, uh, I am all for
a tidy vehicle...

15:24.091 --> 15:26.358
which is very hard to keep

15:26.360 --> 15:28.627
when you gotta share your car
with a Neanderthal, you know?

15:28.629 --> 15:29.761
(gunshots)

15:29.763 --> 15:31.897
(people screaming)

15:31.899 --> 15:34.399
(gunshot)

15:34.401 --> 15:36.101
(gunshots)

15:36.904 --> 15:39.471
MAN: Come on! Get in!

15:39.473 --> 15:41.740
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

15:43.744 --> 15:44.976
There's Daddy's car.

15:49.049 --> 15:51.350
All right.
Mamo, follow that car.

15:51.352 --> 15:52.651
Someone could
be hurt back there.

15:52.652 --> 15:53.951
No, they got people there
that can help.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.437
You got a cell phone I could borrow?
Sure...

15:55.438 --> 15:56.921
Thank you. ...but we're in a black hole.
No service.

15:56.924 --> 15:58.523
Gas station's got a land line.

15:58.525 --> 15:59.791
We could go there, call it in.

15:59.793 --> 16:01.526
No, no, no. Look, we need
to stick with this car

16:01.528 --> 16:02.627
until I can get in touch
with HPD, all right?

16:02.629 --> 16:04.396
All right, brah.
All right.

16:04.398 --> 16:05.964
DANNY:
Excuse me, everybody.

16:05.966 --> 16:07.132
If I could have
your attention, please.

16:07.134 --> 16:09.368
Uh, my name is
Detective Danny Williams.

16:09.370 --> 16:10.469
I'm with Five-O.

16:10.471 --> 16:12.371
I'm very sorry
to interrupt your trip,

16:12.373 --> 16:14.072
but I need to take this bus

16:14.074 --> 16:16.475
and follow that car that we just
saw flee the gas station.

16:16.477 --> 16:18.009
So if everybody in
the front could, please,

16:18.011 --> 16:19.845
move to the back, please.

16:19.847 --> 16:20.912
Thank you.

16:20.914 --> 16:22.581
Just have a seat
and try to relax.

16:22.583 --> 16:24.333
All right. Thank you.

16:24.334 --> 16:26.084
Your phones. Everybody, please,
take out your cell phones.

16:26.086 --> 16:27.519
Let me know if
anyone has service.

16:29.056 --> 16:30.756
Don't look at me like that.

16:36.397 --> 16:38.430
STEVE:<i> You know, Jerry might</i>
<i> be onto something</i>

16:38.432 --> 16:39.698
<i> with his ghost theory.</i>

16:39.700 --> 16:40.832
<i>I mean, everyone in the service</i>

16:40.834 --> 16:42.167
<i> knows about the U.S.S.</i> Hornet.

16:42.169 --> 16:43.602
GROVER:
The what-what?

16:43.604 --> 16:44.803
It was an aircraft carrier

16:44.805 --> 16:46.905
that helped sink
the<i> Yamato</i> in 1945.

16:46.907 --> 16:49.708
But in her 27 years
of active service,

16:49.710 --> 16:52.411
over 300 people lost
their lives aboard that ship.

16:52.413 --> 16:53.812
Some people now claim it

16:53.814 --> 16:55.580
to be the most haunted
place in America.

16:55.582 --> 16:57.849
In fact, some
people even claim

16:57.851 --> 17:01.620
to have actually seen
the Dress White Ghost.

17:01.622 --> 17:03.522
Well, what's the
"Dress White Ghost"?

17:03.524 --> 17:05.490
Oh, it's this sailor in
his dress white uniform.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.025
He just roams the corridors

17:07.027 --> 17:10.061
as if carrying out orders
from another time.

17:10.063 --> 17:12.831
For real?

17:17.471 --> 17:19.838
STEVE:
Gotcha.

17:22.142 --> 17:24.009
All right, so I got
the toxicology report

17:24.011 --> 17:25.010
back from the lab.

17:25.012 --> 17:26.545
Both men had
extremely high levels

17:26.547 --> 17:27.813
of mercury in their systems.

17:27.815 --> 17:29.614
Their vitamin D levels
were so low

17:29.616 --> 17:31.016
that the lab said it looked like

17:31.018 --> 17:33.084
they hadn't seen
the sun in years.

17:33.086 --> 17:35.153
And both sets of
lungs also had evidence

17:35.155 --> 17:37.489
of poisoning
from diesel fumes.

17:37.491 --> 17:39.124
So I'm thinking,
whatever boat they were on,

17:39.126 --> 17:41.226
they were on it
for a very long time.

17:41.228 --> 17:42.894
They were below deck
or working at night.

17:42.896 --> 17:45.564
Right? That would explain
the vitamin D deficiency.

17:45.566 --> 17:47.799
It would also explain why they
were breathing diesel fumes

17:47.801 --> 17:49.835
from the ship's engine room.

17:49.837 --> 17:51.036
And if the only
thing you're eating,

17:51.038 --> 17:52.504
day in, day out, is fish,

17:52.506 --> 17:54.606
yeah, you could definitely
get mercury poisoning.

17:54.608 --> 17:56.508
So these guys
were fishermen.

17:56.510 --> 17:59.911
Yeah, but the kind of working
conditions they were in...

17:59.913 --> 18:01.613
What kind of a fishing
vessel were they on?

18:01.615 --> 18:03.782
The kind of vessel
that doesn't care

18:03.784 --> 18:06.518
about the people working on it.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.920
I don't think
they were fishermen.

18:08.922 --> 18:11.156
I think they were slaves.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.216
(engine running)

18:21.217 --> 18:22.633
EDWARD TORRES:<i> For three years,</i>
<i> we were on that ship.</i>

18:22.636 --> 18:23.969
MAN 2:
<i> Lights out! No more!</i>

18:26.540 --> 18:28.507
You make nets,
then you eat!

18:31.612 --> 18:33.545
Not once did I see land,

18:33.547 --> 18:35.046
or daylight.

18:36.750 --> 18:39.518
<i> His name was Somchai Wattana.</i>

18:39.520 --> 18:41.786
<i> That was the first,</i>

18:41.788 --> 18:44.589
<i> not the last time,</i>
<i> that he would save me.</i>

18:47.895 --> 18:50.161
We worked
from sundown

18:50.163 --> 18:52.097
to sunup, seven days a week.

18:54.034 --> 18:55.300
<i> If we weren't fishing,</i>

18:55.302 --> 18:57.769
<i> we were repairing nets.</i>

18:57.771 --> 18:59.638
<i> There wasn't much else to do</i>

18:59.640 --> 19:01.106
<i> on our floating prison.</i>

19:02.943 --> 19:05.944
<i> The work kept</i>
<i> our minds occupied.</i>

19:05.946 --> 19:09.014
<i> It was the only way</i>
<i> to keep from going insane.</i>

19:10.250 --> 19:12.183
<i> But if you stopped,</i>

19:12.185 --> 19:13.752
<i> you were punished.</i>

19:13.754 --> 19:14.920
<i>Khun tun!</i>

19:14.922 --> 19:17.556
EDWARD:
<i> Some days, we were beaten</i>

19:17.558 --> 19:19.624
<i> just to remind us</i>
<i> that we were their property.</i>

19:19.626 --> 19:21.693
(screams)

19:23.564 --> 19:26.798
When I slept,

19:26.800 --> 19:30.669
I dreamed of my wife, Tala,

19:30.671 --> 19:32.871
and the child she was carrying.

19:37.744 --> 19:41.212
I dreamed I would see her again.

19:41.214 --> 19:44.816
See the face of my son or
daughter for the first time.

19:46.186 --> 19:49.654
<i> Somchai and I</i>
<i> kept each other strong</i>

19:53.961 --> 19:56.661
How did you escape?

19:56.663 --> 19:59.998
When our freezers
were full of fish,

20:00.000 --> 20:02.100
the ship would anchor offshore

20:02.102 --> 20:04.836
and another boat would sail out
to collect the haul,

20:04.838 --> 20:06.972
to sell in
the local market.

20:06.974 --> 20:09.007
Do you think you could
I.D. that boat?

20:09.009 --> 20:10.942
No.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.145
Our captain always
kept us locked

20:14.147 --> 20:16.748
in the cage below deck
during the handover.

20:16.750 --> 20:19.017
<i> We knew, at these moments,</i>

20:19.019 --> 20:21.119
<i> we would never</i>
<i> be closer to land.</i>

20:21.121 --> 20:22.253
(bell clanging in distance)

20:22.255 --> 20:24.756
<i> Making it to shore seemed like</i>

20:24.758 --> 20:26.825
<i> a million-to-one shot.</i>

20:29.129 --> 20:31.029
(men shouting)

20:31.031 --> 20:33.732
<i> But one day, it seemed like</i>
<i> the only choice.</i>

20:43.644 --> 20:45.110

Hey!

20:45.112 --> 20:46.711
(shouting)

20:48.715 --> 20:49.981
Decha!

21:05.032 --> 21:08.033
For three days and nights...

21:09.302 --> 21:11.136
<i> ...we swam...</i>

21:11.138 --> 21:13.171
<i> and slept...</i>

21:13.173 --> 21:15.173
<i> and swam...</i>

21:15.175 --> 21:17.776
and on the third day,

21:17.778 --> 21:21.146
I looked up and I saw it there,

21:21.148 --> 21:25.116
<i> like a beautiful promise</i>
<i> on the horizon.</i>

21:26.687 --> 21:29.054
<i> I tried to wake my friend...</i>

21:33.093 --> 21:35.960
(voice breaking):
...but he was gone.

21:47.174 --> 21:50.842
At that moment,
I had never felt so alone.

21:50.844 --> 21:53.211
My arms and legs
were burning

21:53.213 --> 21:55.847

21:57.451 --> 22:00.151

22:02.122 --> 22:05.223
<i> ...and slip beneath the waves.</i>

22:09.796 --> 22:11.062
And then I remembered

22:11.064 --> 22:12.797
<i> the promise I made</i>

22:12.799 --> 22:14.766
<i> to my friend Somchai.</i>

22:16.103 --> 22:19.804
<i> Not to let him become</i>
<i> a ghost of the ocean.</i>

22:26.146 --> 22:29.114
It takes a lot to survive
an ordeal like that.

22:33.120 --> 22:34.919

For my child.

22:45.899 --> 22:48.199
It's beautiful.

22:48.201 --> 22:50.368
We contacted your family.

22:50.370 --> 22:52.470
They're on their way

22:55.075 --> 22:56.975

Edward, do you know,

22:58.879 --> 23:02.313
um, how many other men
were held on that ship?

23:05.886 --> 23:08.486
There were 14 others.

23:10.891 --> 23:12.323
All right,
so this Captain Decha,

23:12.325 --> 23:13.892
okay, if he's got
any sense at all,

23:13.894 --> 23:15.026
he's out of here, right?

23:15.028 --> 23:16.294
Two of his men go overboard.

23:16.296 --> 23:18.429
He's got to assume,
however unlikely,

23:18.431 --> 23:20.165
it's possible
they made it to shore

23:20.166 --> 23:21.900
and alerted the authorities
about this operation, right?

23:21.902 --> 23:23.969
He's not gonna stick
around and get caught.

23:23.970 --> 23:26.037
Right, but if that's the case,
his ship could be anywhere.

23:26.039 --> 23:27.272

Nuh-uh.

buying that fish.

23:30.443 --> 23:32.043
And they got to have
ship-to-shore comms,

23:32.045 --> 23:33.278

23:33.280 --> 23:34.813

find Captain Decha
