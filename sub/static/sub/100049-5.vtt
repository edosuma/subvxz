00:01.540 --> 00:04.000
Previously on "How to Get Away
With Murder"...

00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
Banker:
Bermuda North Atlantic Bank.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.380
The balance?
$208,000.

00:06.380 --> 00:08.540
Kelly: Please give
a warm welcome to Solomon Vick.

00:08.540 --> 00:09.830
Solomon:
I know you, Michaela.

00:09.830 --> 00:12.080
I've been waiting for this day
for a long time.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.790
We threw a party.
Everyone was drinking.

00:13.790 --> 00:15.830
Four guys
took one girl upstairs.

00:15.830 --> 00:19.120
Those articles all mentioned
a gang-rape cover-up.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.460
I don't want anything
to do with you.

00:20.460 --> 00:21.540
Asher: I have a girl
about to come over.

00:21.540 --> 00:23.170
How am I supposed to explain
that my sister's here?

00:23.170 --> 00:24.830
I just want to talk.

00:24.830 --> 00:26.620
It's Cora Duncan. I'll get back
to you as soon as possible.

00:26.620 --> 00:28.670
Okay.
Let's finally do the thing.

00:28.670 --> 00:30.330
Gabriel: They're
her therapy sessions with Sam.

00:30.330 --> 00:32.000
Gabriel: But it was you
who manipulated him.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.460
Young Annalise:
I met someone else.

00:33.460 --> 00:35.420
Young Sam: Who is it?
He's my therapist.

00:35.420 --> 00:36.620
I found her.

00:36.620 --> 00:38.750
His cab's license matches
the one Laurel got into.

00:38.750 --> 00:40.080
It's some kind
of safe house.

00:40.080 --> 00:41.670
The FBI?
Are you working with them?

00:41.670 --> 00:42.620
No.

00:43.620 --> 00:45.580
No. Frank?

00:45.580 --> 00:47.040
Frank.

00:51.250 --> 00:53.420
Young Annalise:
I met someone else.

00:53.420 --> 00:54.670
Young Sam: Who is it?

00:54.670 --> 00:56.210
A man.

00:56.210 --> 00:58.790
He's kind,
caring, handsome.

00:58.790 --> 01:01.380
Problem is,
he's my therapist.

01:01.380 --> 01:04.250
Annalise --
I'm sorry, I just can't stop
thinking about you.

01:04.250 --> 01:06.750
I'm married.
To a woman who doesn't
make you happy.

01:06.750 --> 01:08.080
She does.
You're lying.

01:08.080 --> 01:10.960
You're just as lost as me.
I see it, Sam.

01:10.960 --> 01:13.710
And you see me -- all of me,
even the worst parts,

01:13.710 --> 01:16.000
and they don't scare you
because you want this, too.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.080
Tell me I'm wrong.

01:18.290 --> 01:20.080
See? You can't.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.880
This happens in therapy,
Annalise.

01:21.880 --> 01:23.290
You've felt this
with other patients?

01:23.290 --> 01:24.580
Have you?

01:24.580 --> 01:26.420
Tell me to go
if that's what you want.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.960
Of course
I don't want that.

01:27.960 --> 01:29.920
'Cause you want me?

01:29.920 --> 01:32.170
Say it, or I'll go.

01:32.170 --> 01:34.120
I want you.

01:34.120 --> 01:38.500
I've wanted you
since the second I saw you.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.790
Touch me.

01:40.790 --> 01:43.500
Touch me, Sam.
Touch me.

01:43.500 --> 01:46.920
Annalise, I want...
every part of you.

02:05.170 --> 02:06.670
Hey.

02:10.790 --> 02:12.580
Bonnie, how bad is it?

02:12.580 --> 02:14.170
-We don't know yet.
-He's hypotensive.

02:14.170 --> 02:15.960
Blood pressure 70 over palp.
-Oxygen saturation's below 80.

02:15.960 --> 02:17.330
Prep him for ultrasound.
Let's look for blood in the gut.

02:17.330 --> 02:18.670
What does that mean?
Internal bleeding?

02:18.670 --> 02:19.790
Ma'am, please step back.

02:28.790 --> 02:30.080
Hey, Frank.

02:32.580 --> 02:33.830
Where is she?

02:33.830 --> 02:36.580
You think
I'd follow you here if I knew?

02:36.580 --> 02:38.710
All I've done since that night
is try to find her.

02:38.710 --> 02:41.210
I'm embarrassed
I haven't.

02:41.210 --> 02:44.000
But Laurel...

02:44.000 --> 02:47.040
Laurel's always been
a few steps ahead.

02:47.040 --> 02:49.290
Of all of us,
apparently.

02:49.290 --> 02:52.080
You finished,
or you gonna kill me?

02:52.080 --> 02:54.290
Mnh-mnh.

02:54.290 --> 02:55.920
Last thing I want to do
is hurt you, Frank.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.080
'Cause you know
the Feds are on your ass.

02:57.080 --> 02:58.290
No.

02:58.290 --> 02:59.290
'Cause you're the only guy
smart enough

02:59.290 --> 03:01.000
to help me find
my sister.

03:05.080 --> 03:08.790
I'll kill you before I ever
let you see Laurel again.

03:13.710 --> 03:14.750
It's nice seeing you.

03:35.080 --> 03:36.210
Psst.

03:36.210 --> 03:37.790
Hey.
Check-in time.

03:37.790 --> 03:39.170
Check-in for what?

03:39.170 --> 03:41.710
Regret, shame,
Catholic guilt.

03:41.710 --> 03:42.960
None of the above.
You?

03:42.960 --> 03:44.330
I feel great.
It's weird.

03:44.330 --> 03:46.540
Okay, here we go.

03:46.540 --> 03:48.080
Eggs Benedict.

03:48.080 --> 03:49.710
Let me know
if I used too much cayenne.

03:49.710 --> 03:51.620
I have an aggressive hand.

03:51.620 --> 03:53.580
As you both know.

03:54.830 --> 03:56.420
Can we keep him?

03:56.420 --> 03:58.420
Michaela:
It was a one-night stand?

03:58.420 --> 04:00.830
I got to know Iris
during Dwight's trial.

04:00.830 --> 04:02.580
She was a rock,
you know --

04:02.580 --> 04:05.000
the way she handled stress
while working two jobs,

04:05.000 --> 04:07.250
yet she was the one
giving me props.

04:07.250 --> 04:10.960
Yeah, it was
a one-night stand, but...

04:10.960 --> 04:13.500
it meant something to me.

04:13.500 --> 04:15.380
When did she tell you
she was pregnant?

04:15.380 --> 04:16.620
She didn't.

04:16.620 --> 04:20.210
I found out after I saw her
a few months later.

04:20.210 --> 04:22.250
She begged me
not to say anything.

04:22.250 --> 04:26.210
So it was her decision?

04:26.210 --> 04:28.620
How convenient she's not alive
to say otherwise.

04:28.620 --> 04:30.500
You think I'd choose
to have my own daughter

04:30.500 --> 04:31.790
be raised
by someone else?

04:31.790 --> 04:33.380
You did choose that.

04:35.290 --> 04:37.290
And I regretted it --
for years,

04:37.290 --> 04:39.000
until I finally
looked you up.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.420
You were already
in high school.

04:40.420 --> 04:41.880
You should've come
and rescued me.

04:41.880 --> 04:43.170
You were a valedictorian.

04:43.170 --> 04:44.960
You had a full scholarship
to Yale.

04:44.960 --> 04:48.000
I only reached out to Annalise
when you got into Middleton,

04:48.000 --> 04:50.620
asked her to keep her eye
on you, which she has, I hope?

04:50.620 --> 04:53.380
Sir, your video conference with
the Rytax Board is starting.

04:54.880 --> 04:56.420
Come by my room
tomorrow at 10:00.

04:56.420 --> 04:57.670
You have a strategy call
at 10:00 tomorrow.

04:57.670 --> 04:59.290
Cancel it.

04:59.290 --> 05:00.170
10:00?

05:04.830 --> 05:06.040
Sleep well.

05:10.960 --> 05:13.170
I was a hot mess after Dad died.
You can't blame me for that.

05:13.170 --> 05:14.710
I blame you
for siding with Mom.

05:14.710 --> 05:16.290
She made me.

05:16.290 --> 05:17.960
You are an adult woman,
Chloe!

05:17.960 --> 05:19.210
Mom said
that you were the one

05:19.210 --> 05:20.830
who made up that stuff
about Dad being corrupt.

05:20.830 --> 05:22.580
He was corrupt.
I don't believe that.

05:22.580 --> 05:25.120
Why would he kill himself
if he was innocent, Chloe?

05:28.120 --> 05:29.880
Don't you even wanna know
why I'm here?

05:29.880 --> 05:31.500
You're broke, right?

05:31.500 --> 05:33.120
Or you got another DUI and Dad's
not here to bail you out?

05:34.790 --> 05:35.830
It's Mom.

05:37.620 --> 05:38.540
She needs you.

05:38.540 --> 05:39.960
Screw her.

05:39.960 --> 05:41.420
She hasn't left the house
in months!

05:41.420 --> 05:43.670
She keeps talking about
giving up, and...

05:46.000 --> 05:48.620
I'm scared she's gonna
hang herself, like Dad.

05:52.710 --> 05:54.790
He is not gonna die.

05:54.790 --> 05:56.580
It's Frank.

05:56.580 --> 05:58.210
He's gonna
outlive us all.

06:00.290 --> 06:02.080
Here.

06:02.080 --> 06:04.580
Oh, hell no.
I'm jittery enough.

06:04.580 --> 06:05.620
When are you
gonna tell her?

06:05.620 --> 06:06.750
Tell me what?

06:07.710 --> 06:08.540
Nate?

06:12.960 --> 06:14.750
The FBI
offered me a deal.

06:14.750 --> 06:16.920
When?
A few days ago.
I told them no.

06:16.920 --> 06:18.830
Then why not tell me?
So you wouldn't
react this way.

06:18.830 --> 06:20.580
I'm reacting this way
because you didn't tell me.

06:20.580 --> 06:21.580
Tell her the rest, Nate.

06:23.290 --> 06:26.080
He still thinks Tegan is
working with the Castillos.

06:26.080 --> 06:28.330
Stop.
How do we know she's not part
of what happened to Frank?

06:28.330 --> 06:29.330
You're an idiot.

06:31.080 --> 06:32.000
You're here
with Frank Delfino?

06:33.330 --> 06:34.880
Yes.
Do you know something?

06:34.880 --> 06:36.620
No. We're hoping to get
some information from you.

06:36.620 --> 06:38.670
-You're all family?
-Friends.

06:38.670 --> 06:41.210
Frank lives with me.
He was left at my house.

06:41.210 --> 06:42.620
Our records say
a man called 911.

06:42.620 --> 06:43.920
Yeah, that was me.

06:43.920 --> 06:45.290
Who are you
to Mr. Delfino?

06:45.290 --> 06:47.880
A friend.
Like she told you.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.460
Please don't
get aggressive, sir.

06:49.460 --> 06:50.790
Annalise:
You want to see aggressive?

06:50.790 --> 06:52.620
Then keep asking
these stupid questions.

06:52.620 --> 06:54.210
We know who did this
to Frank.

06:54.210 --> 06:56.080
His name is
Xavier Castillo,

06:56.080 --> 06:57.670
and the FBI knows
where to find him,

06:57.670 --> 06:59.830
so go out there
and do your damn job.

07:03.250 --> 07:04.830
Dr. Cundey!

07:04.830 --> 07:06.670
Sir, please do not move.

07:06.670 --> 07:07.960
Frank, it's Bonnie.

07:07.960 --> 07:09.120
Let's restrain him.

07:09.120 --> 07:10.920
-He needs morphine!
-IV's out.

07:10.920 --> 07:12.710
Get me 50 mikes fentanyl!
Was it Xavier?
Did he do this to you?

07:12.710 --> 07:15.040
-Laurel.
-What?

07:15.040 --> 07:16.960
Laurel.

07:16.960 --> 07:18.960
You saw Laurel?
She was there?

07:18.960 --> 07:20.670
Let's get him
to the OR!

07:22.170 --> 07:23.170
Laurel was there.

07:23.170 --> 07:24.380
We don't know that.

07:24.380 --> 07:26.670
Well, he said her name.
She was there.

07:28.380 --> 07:29.880
Woman: Someone call
the on-call surgeon.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.330
We need to get him
into surgery.

07:39.080 --> 07:44.080
The FBI has an informant
working against you and Keating.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.170
It's someone
in your group.

07:46.790 --> 07:48.000
Frank:
Give me the name.

07:51.620 --> 07:54.120
First, help me
find my sister, Frank.

07:57.040 --> 07:58.540
Laurel hates you.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.170
More than your father,
even.

08:02.170 --> 08:04.540
'Cause at least your father
came up on his own.

08:04.540 --> 08:05.830
But you...

08:07.670 --> 08:10.120
It must be hard to know

08:10.120 --> 08:14.880
that Daddy's little girl
will always outshine you.

08:39.250 --> 08:42.040
He just
went into surgery.

08:42.040 --> 08:45.710
I'm telling you that
so you can update the FBI.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.420
Well, Lanford says
Miller's innocent.

08:49.620 --> 08:51.000
And you believe that?

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Not sure.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.380
Why are you being a fool?

08:53.380 --> 08:55.000
I could say the same
for you believing Tegan.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.330
Oh, shut up with that.

08:56.330 --> 08:58.290
Give me proof
she ain't behind all this.

08:58.290 --> 09:00.210
I have my gut,
the same gut that tells me

09:00.210 --> 09:02.830
that you are not an informant
for the FBI.

09:02.830 --> 09:04.620
Or am I
being a fool here?

09:04.620 --> 09:07.120
After everything that we've
been through with your father,

09:07.120 --> 09:09.330
maybe you're small enough
to turn on me.

09:09.330 --> 09:10.620
Keep talking to me
like that,

09:10.620 --> 09:12.460
you make a deal
look better and better.

09:28.750 --> 09:31.250
Still love working
the weekends, huh?

09:31.250 --> 09:32.620
I'm not working today.

09:32.620 --> 09:34.290
I just wanted you to see

09:34.290 --> 09:37.460
my new giant, corner,
managing-partner office.

09:37.460 --> 09:39.580
And you don't want me
near your apartment.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.460
Townhouse.
And that's true.

09:41.460 --> 09:43.040
No way in hell
I'm letting you go home

09:43.040 --> 09:45.380
and tell Patrick you don't like
my window treatments.

09:45.380 --> 09:46.830
They're fantastic,
by the way.

09:47.830 --> 09:49.380
I'm sure they are.

09:52.790 --> 09:54.000
Hi, Tegan.

09:55.330 --> 09:57.330
Hello, Cora.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.120
Sit.

10:02.120 --> 10:03.790
Shall we start
at the top?

10:03.790 --> 10:04.750
Yeah.

10:07.170 --> 10:09.670
There won't be any air rights on
the market left in five years.

10:09.670 --> 10:11.080
You've --

10:11.080 --> 10:12.830
Listen, Warren,
my next meeting's here.

10:12.830 --> 10:14.460
Just meet the asking price.

10:14.460 --> 10:15.750
Alright.

10:18.420 --> 10:20.880
You didn't run back
to Philly?

10:20.880 --> 10:22.250
Thought about it.

10:22.250 --> 10:24.710
Hey, you hungry?
I-I-I don't know what you like.

10:24.710 --> 10:26.080
I just ordered
the whole menu.

10:29.540 --> 10:32.420
Well, if it's gonna
go to waste...

10:32.420 --> 10:34.250
So...

10:34.250 --> 10:36.620
I have more questions
about my mother, obviously,

10:36.620 --> 10:40.080
but also exactly how did you
find out that I was adopted?

10:40.080 --> 10:42.710
First, I'd like to talk to you
about this --

10:42.710 --> 10:45.830
"Birthing While Black:
Racial Disparities in
Maternal Mortality."

10:45.830 --> 10:48.000
You were, what, eight years
ahead of the curve on this?

10:48.000 --> 10:49.380
Is that my Yale thesis?

10:49.380 --> 10:50.710
I leave no stone unturned

10:50.710 --> 10:53.120
when it comes to researching
a new business partner.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.250
Um...new what?

10:55.250 --> 10:58.880
I've been getting dozens
of proposals on my women's fund,

10:58.880 --> 11:01.380
and I would like you
to help me decide

11:01.380 --> 11:03.170
who gets
the first cash infusion.

11:03.170 --> 11:05.880
That sounds more like "employee"
than "business partner."

11:05.880 --> 11:07.000
Not if you're getting 2%

11:07.000 --> 11:08.210
on the back end
of my future earnings.

11:13.080 --> 11:14.710
10%.

11:14.710 --> 11:15.790
2.5.

11:15.790 --> 11:17.210
You left me in a swamp.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.790
3.
With horrible white people.

11:18.790 --> 11:21.210
Anything more than 3.5
is extortion.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.000
Boyfriend problems?

11:29.000 --> 11:30.880
Need me to handle him?

11:30.880 --> 11:32.790
4% is as low
as I'll go.

11:32.790 --> 11:34.500
Otherwise, I'll take
that entire platter of macarons

11:34.500 --> 11:35.750
and you'll never
see me again.

11:37.710 --> 11:39.460
Deal.

11:39.460 --> 11:41.620
Rochelle, get Michaela started
with everything she needs.

11:41.620 --> 11:43.580
Yes, sir.
Mr. Shiu's on the line.

11:43.580 --> 11:44.830
Mm.

11:44.830 --> 11:46.500
Li, hey.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.790
Tell me you did not pull the
trigger on this Huang-Zhao deal.

11:55.210 --> 11:56.670
Wake up.
It's Saturday.

11:56.670 --> 11:58.620
Don't care.
I got stuff to do.

11:58.620 --> 12:00.330
"Stuff" more important
than your suicidal mother?

12:00.330 --> 12:02.790
Yes, actually.
Now, leave so I can get ready.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.460
God, your breath smells
like ass, by the way.

12:06.460 --> 12:08.620
That's your apartment.
Well, at least I paid for it
with my own money.

12:08.620 --> 12:10.670
-And out you go.
-Okay, wait.

12:10.670 --> 12:12.250
Chloe, enough.

12:12.250 --> 12:14.080
Mom fixed the Tiffany thing
for you.

12:14.080 --> 12:15.290
Asher:
Dad, I'm in trouble.

12:15.290 --> 12:16.290
What's wrong, Ash?

12:16.290 --> 12:18.170
It's about Tiffany.

12:18.170 --> 12:19.620
That was Dad.

12:19.620 --> 12:21.290
It was Mom.

12:21.290 --> 12:22.880
She scared Tiffany's parents
into dropping the case

12:22.880 --> 12:24.250
because that's who Mom is.

12:24.250 --> 12:25.750
She'll do anything
to protect her children,

12:25.750 --> 12:27.170
even if they're rapists.

12:27.170 --> 12:28.880
I didn't --
That was --

12:28.880 --> 12:30.210
Your friends?
Right.

12:30.210 --> 12:32.420
My point is, now it's your turn
to be there for her.

12:32.420 --> 12:34.420
And me.
We're your family.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.420
You ditched me
when I needed you the most,

12:36.420 --> 12:38.040
so I found a new family.

12:38.040 --> 12:39.420
Who?
It's none of your business,
okay?

12:39.420 --> 12:41.380
Would you get out
of my house, please?

12:41.380 --> 12:43.120
It's not a house.
Go.

12:50.580 --> 12:51.960
Where's Michaela?

12:51.960 --> 12:55.290
Connor: She's still on her
lover's getaway with Gabriel.

12:55.290 --> 12:57.460
-Tell me you're joking.
-Yeah, my sentiments exactly.

12:57.460 --> 12:59.880
They're just hooking up.
Now, tell us why you're here.

13:00.960 --> 13:02.420
Frank got beat up.

13:02.420 --> 13:04.080
We think it was Xavier.

13:04.080 --> 13:05.670
-Is he okay?
-How bad was it?

13:05.670 --> 13:07.620
He's in surgery now, but we
have to prepare for the worst.

13:09.120 --> 13:11.330
The worst?
Like, he might die?

13:11.330 --> 13:13.250
Or that we're next?
We're fine.

13:13.250 --> 13:15.580
They kidnapped Laurel
and Christopher. We're not fine.

13:15.580 --> 13:16.880
You're mad at me
when I don't tell you things

13:16.880 --> 13:18.380
and mad when I do.

13:18.380 --> 13:21.170
Okay, I have -- I have something
to tell you all.

13:21.170 --> 13:23.710
Please don't yell at me.

13:23.710 --> 13:24.670
Oliver?

13:26.170 --> 13:27.620
Frank might've
found Laurel.

13:27.620 --> 13:28.670
-What?
-Where?

13:28.670 --> 13:31.580
He had a photo of her
leaving a bank.

13:31.580 --> 13:33.080
It was a few days
after she disappeared.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.250
She was getting in a cab,

13:34.250 --> 13:36.830
so I helped Frank
find the driver.

13:36.830 --> 13:37.960
Why didn't you tell us?

13:37.960 --> 13:39.380
Because Frank said
he didn't want everyone

13:39.380 --> 13:42.120
making fun of him about
being obsessed with Laurel.

13:42.120 --> 13:43.710
And you fell for that?

13:43.710 --> 13:45.290
Did the cab driver know
where Laurel was going?

13:45.290 --> 13:48.290
No. Frank said the guy didn't
even remember driving her,

13:48.290 --> 13:49.790
so I thought
he stopped looking for her.

13:49.790 --> 13:51.500
I'm sorry.

13:51.500 --> 13:54.080
Well, don't apologize to him.
Apologize to Frank.

13:54.080 --> 13:56.540
He's the one who might die
because of your stupidity.

14:06.670 --> 14:08.580
How you doing?

14:08.580 --> 14:09.620
Tired?

14:09.620 --> 14:10.960
It's Laurel, right?

14:10.960 --> 14:12.790
She's talking
to the FBI.

14:14.420 --> 14:16.170
Frank, we're only here

14:16.170 --> 14:17.830
because I want you
to help me find her.

14:17.830 --> 14:20.710
She cleared out her safety
deposit box a few weeks ago.

14:20.710 --> 14:21.960
You probably helped her.

14:21.960 --> 14:23.290
No.

14:23.290 --> 14:25.420
So this is all
just some trap.

14:29.120 --> 14:32.080
I emptied
the safe deposit box, Frank.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.710
Well, not me.

14:36.120 --> 14:37.330
Her.

14:42.830 --> 14:44.710
My assistant, Jamie.

14:44.710 --> 14:47.540
She took everything inside,
including Wes' confession.

14:47.540 --> 14:49.380
He wrote about
how you killed Sam,

14:49.380 --> 14:52.460
Annalise helped cover it up,
how you shot Wallace Mahoney.

14:52.460 --> 14:54.120
So?

14:54.120 --> 14:56.670
Take it to the FBI.

14:56.670 --> 14:59.120
All I want
is my sister back.

14:59.120 --> 15:01.920
You just have to say yes.

15:26.670 --> 15:28.170
Trauma surgeon:
The main source of the bleeding

15:28.170 --> 15:30.540
was caused
by a large intestinal tear,

15:30.540 --> 15:32.380
but we also believe
that he was electrocuted.

15:32.380 --> 15:34.830
We discovered burn marks
on the body.

15:34.830 --> 15:38.250
The effects of electrocution
can cause kidney failure,

15:38.250 --> 15:40.080
as well as the loss
of some physical ability.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.750
Like what?

15:41.750 --> 15:45.040
Breathing, walking, all types
of motor coordination.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.880
I'm only telling you
so that you can prepare.

15:55.670 --> 15:57.210
This is Michaela Pratt.

15:57.210 --> 15:59.290
A text or e-mail
is preferred to voicemail.

15:59.290 --> 16:01.380
Look, I know you're pissed,

16:01.380 --> 16:04.500
but you're also the one
who said "no ghosting," so...

16:05.710 --> 16:07.920
I'm not giving up.

16:07.920 --> 16:09.120
Call me.

16:11.080 --> 16:13.420
Ms. DaSilva's proposal
for wind energy

16:13.420 --> 16:14.830
guarantees you
a double-digit return

16:14.830 --> 16:17.330
on your $10 million investment
within five years.

16:17.330 --> 16:19.290
Unless the region's
political instability

16:19.290 --> 16:20.830
makes foreign investment
unfeasible.

16:20.830 --> 16:22.830
No, what's happening
in Venezuela and Bolivia

16:22.830 --> 16:24.000
works to your advantage.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.670
I'm sorry.
This proposal's a pass for me.

16:25.670 --> 16:27.750
But I'm your business partner,
and I'm right.

16:27.750 --> 16:29.620
Take the loss.
Move on.

16:29.620 --> 16:31.710
Mr. Vick, I have Yardley
calling from Reykjavik.

16:31.710 --> 16:33.080
Mm.

16:33.080 --> 16:35.040
Uh, Rochelle, tell Yardley
we'll call back.

16:36.500 --> 16:37.580
And you leave, too.

16:46.500 --> 16:49.210
So, is this
what you did to my mom --

16:49.210 --> 16:50.960
told her what she wanted
so she'd open her legs,

16:50.960 --> 16:52.420
then ditched her
when you got your fill?

16:52.420 --> 16:53.830
That is not
how any of this happened.

16:53.830 --> 16:55.250
See,
what I don't understand

16:55.250 --> 16:57.750
is not checking on her
after she had me,

16:57.750 --> 17:01.000
or at least wanting to make sure
that she or I was okay.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.620
Or maybe...you're making up
that version of the story.

17:04.620 --> 17:05.830
Why would I do that?

17:05.830 --> 17:07.420
To hide the fact
that you're a bad person.

17:07.420 --> 17:08.790
Okay.

17:08.790 --> 17:10.880
Michaela, fine.

17:10.880 --> 17:12.000
Let's say
that I screwed up --

17:12.000 --> 17:13.710
I just did.

17:17.290 --> 17:19.880
What can I do
to get you to trust me?

17:19.880 --> 17:21.460
Seriously?

17:21.460 --> 17:24.290
This is the biggest regret
of my life,

17:24.290 --> 17:25.620
and I want to fix it.

17:25.620 --> 17:26.830
Us.

17:30.460 --> 17:31.960
Give me money.

17:34.620 --> 17:36.250
Is that all?

17:36.250 --> 17:37.210
Considering
you're incapable

17:37.210 --> 17:38.750
of giving me a half-hour
of your time

17:38.750 --> 17:40.830
without a work call
interrupting?

17:40.830 --> 17:42.290
Yes.

17:49.790 --> 17:52.080
And don't think that this is
a one-time payment.

17:52.080 --> 17:53.500
I researched
your net worth.

17:57.170 --> 17:58.620
Here.

18:06.040 --> 18:07.880
Take whatever
you think you deserve.

18:10.290 --> 18:12.290
Tegan: You're paying
for all the couples counseling.

18:12.290 --> 18:14.120
It was couples counseling.
We both went.

18:14.120 --> 18:16.830
Because of you and Patrick.
Hell, make him pay for it.

18:16.830 --> 18:18.170
That's not gonna happen.

18:18.170 --> 18:19.960
'Cause he's still stuck
in that janky FEMA job?

18:19.960 --> 18:21.380
We broke up, Tegan.

18:22.420 --> 18:24.290
When?

18:24.290 --> 18:25.500
Six months ago.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.920
Go ahead.
Do your victory lap.

18:28.920 --> 18:30.290
Laugh your ass off.

18:30.290 --> 18:31.880
You thought
this would make me happy?

18:31.880 --> 18:33.460
The only thing worse
than being left for a man

18:33.460 --> 18:35.670
is being left for a man
you're no longer with.

18:35.670 --> 18:37.210
You're really making this
about you?

18:37.210 --> 18:38.750
Why are you
only telling me this now?

18:41.710 --> 18:44.170
Your egotistical ass
thought I'd get my hopes up

18:44.170 --> 18:45.290
about
getting back together?

18:45.290 --> 18:47.170
No. No, that's not --
Then admit this.

18:47.170 --> 18:49.420
That whole story about you
and Patrick not being a thing

18:49.420 --> 18:51.460
until after we separated --
that's bull, right?

18:51.460 --> 18:52.830
You were sleeping together
before?

18:52.830 --> 18:55.120
We did not get intimate
until after I moved out.

19:01.500 --> 19:05.750
But...I had feelings
for him before.

19:13.210 --> 19:15.250
I'm about to take you
for everything you're worth.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.120
Are we sure
this is even a real check?

19:28.120 --> 19:30.000
It better be so we can
cash it for millions

19:30.000 --> 19:31.580
and all flee
the Castillos.
Michaela: No.

19:31.580 --> 19:33.170
Just listen
to what's been going on here.

19:33.170 --> 19:34.830
It's a trap to find out
how much I think I'm worth.

19:34.830 --> 19:36.290
What does Gabriel
think you should do?

19:36.290 --> 19:37.420
Since you took him
to meet your father

19:37.420 --> 19:38.670
instead of, say, me?

19:38.670 --> 19:39.830
We don't have time
for this.

19:39.830 --> 19:41.000
You know, the last time
I told you a secret,

19:41.000 --> 19:42.710
you went
straight to Annalise

19:42.710 --> 19:44.330
and said Gabriel killed
his mom's ex.

19:44.330 --> 19:46.000
Yeah, I still think
he did that.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.330
Well, he didn't.
Well, he's a liar.

19:47.330 --> 19:49.290
We're all liars,
even Oliver.

19:49.290 --> 19:50.920
I was just trying
to be a good friend.

19:50.920 --> 19:52.210
To Frank?

19:52.210 --> 19:54.500
Wait, what did I miss?

19:54.500 --> 19:56.500
Oh, nothing big.
Just -- Frank found Laurel.

19:56.500 --> 19:57.750
What?!
Yeah.

19:57.750 --> 19:59.420
And Oliver knew
and didn't tell us,

19:59.420 --> 20:01.080
and now Frank's
about to die in a hospital

20:01.080 --> 20:02.750
after being beaten up
by probably Xavier.

20:02.750 --> 20:05.620
What -- How are you
telling me this just now?

20:05.620 --> 20:07.420
You were too busy
humble bragging about
your blank check.

20:09.080 --> 20:10.540
Oh, don't worry.

20:10.540 --> 20:12.210
That's probably just Xavier
coming to kill us all.

20:15.830 --> 20:17.120
Who are you?

20:17.120 --> 20:19.670
Chloe.
Is my brother here?

20:19.670 --> 20:21.120
You stalker.

20:21.120 --> 20:24.120
You forgot to turn off
your location on Flirt Inferno.

20:24.120 --> 20:26.290
Hi, friends
Asher thinks of as family.

20:38.250 --> 20:39.500
Frank: Aah!

20:50.960 --> 20:52.290
Just say stop,
and we will.

20:55.620 --> 20:56.580
Guard: Hey.

21:21.500 --> 21:24.380
You can't leave me here
all alone, okay?

21:24.380 --> 21:27.420
You gotta stay for me.

21:30.380 --> 21:31.460
How long have
y'all known each other?

21:31.460 --> 21:32.960
Since we got to law school.
Now let's go.

21:32.960 --> 21:35.120
But you all live here
except Asher. Why is that?

21:35.120 --> 21:36.420
'Cause I wanted
to live alone.

21:36.420 --> 21:37.790
Now, get over here
and leave.

21:37.790 --> 21:41.170
No. I wanna get to know
your friends/family.

21:41.170 --> 21:43.580
Did my brother tell you
that our mom's not well?

21:43.580 --> 21:44.960
Chloe.

21:44.960 --> 21:46.790
-What's wrong with your mom?
-Suicidal.

21:46.790 --> 21:48.790
She's exaggerating.
That's her one special skill.

21:48.790 --> 21:50.830
We lost all our family money
due to our dead dad

21:50.830 --> 21:52.330
being falsely accused
of corruption.

21:52.330 --> 21:54.290
See? All the lies
you never wanted to hear.

21:54.290 --> 21:57.080
If they care about you
like you say they do, Asher,

21:57.080 --> 21:58.460
'course they want to hear.

21:58.460 --> 21:59.830
You do care about him,
right?

21:59.830 --> 22:01.170
Of course.

22:01.170 --> 22:02.210
-We love him.
-He's like a brother.

22:03.460 --> 22:05.710
Asher's middle name?
You.

22:05.710 --> 22:07.620
He...doesn't have one.

22:07.620 --> 22:09.040
It's Kevin,
and

22:09.040 --> 22:10.830
I'm sorry, uh,
what's your point?

22:10.830 --> 22:12.500
What? You don't think that
we're close to your brother?

22:12.500 --> 22:14.920
That we don't know that
his favorite holiday
is the Super Bowl?

22:14.920 --> 22:16.000
Ice cream, rocky road.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.420
Oh, and you know
what else I know?

22:17.420 --> 22:19.040
He needed you
after your dad died,

22:19.040 --> 22:20.250
but you weren't there.

22:20.250 --> 22:21.420
I was.

22:23.420 --> 22:25.210
Oh, my God.
Are you dating this girl?

22:25.210 --> 22:27.380
No.
But we did,
for a very long time,

22:27.380 --> 22:28.750
something it seems
that you would know

22:28.750 --> 22:31.080
if you were as close to Asher
as you say you are.

22:31.080 --> 22:32.460
Oh.

22:32.460 --> 22:34.170
And the name's Michaela.

22:35.790 --> 22:36.670
I'm ready to go now.

22:36.670 --> 22:38.000
Yeah.

22:42.960 --> 22:44.670
Sorry.

22:49.170 --> 22:50.830
Tell me
how Frank found Laurel.

22:53.710 --> 22:55.250
Nate: Peace offering.

22:55.250 --> 22:57.290
Thanks.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.380
What?

23:02.380 --> 23:03.790
Tegan's wife is in town.

23:03.790 --> 23:05.170
Can you please stop?

23:05.170 --> 23:06.540
She works
for Homeland Security.

23:06.540 --> 23:08.080
Don't they have
a history of torture?

23:08.080 --> 23:09.960
I can't deal with this
right now.
I know.

23:09.960 --> 23:12.830
But now's not the time to let
our guard down about anyone.

23:18.750 --> 23:20.960
Flowers just 'cause I told you
you can come over?

23:20.960 --> 23:22.880
They were sitting
at your door.

23:22.880 --> 23:24.250
Oh.

23:25.670 --> 23:27.960
"Might these persuade you

23:27.960 --> 23:29.880
to say yes
to a second date?

23:29.880 --> 23:31.210
Robert."

23:31.210 --> 23:33.120
Robert from
our Flirt Inferno case?

23:33.120 --> 23:35.250
Mm.
We went on a date.

23:35.250 --> 23:36.670
I honestly forgot
until now.

23:36.670 --> 23:37.920
You get some?

23:37.920 --> 23:39.250
Tell me
what he's working with.

23:39.250 --> 23:40.620
Not that I care...

23:40.620 --> 23:42.500
but if you're gonna go
with a man,

23:42.500 --> 23:44.040
it better be worth it.

23:45.580 --> 23:46.620
You're drunk?

23:46.620 --> 23:48.380
Sloppy.

23:49.750 --> 23:51.790
I did some shots
before coming here,

23:51.790 --> 23:53.580
out of respect
for your sobriety and whatnot.

24:01.500 --> 24:02.670
Bad day?

24:03.750 --> 24:06.040
The worst.

24:06.040 --> 24:10.210
Cora and I finally sat down

24:10.210 --> 24:13.540
to work out the divorce,
but...

24:13.540 --> 24:14.580
See?

24:17.000 --> 24:19.620
These tears mean
I'm still in love with her.

24:19.620 --> 24:21.540
I wish I weren't,

24:21.540 --> 24:23.380
but the dumb bitch
is in my blood!

24:23.380 --> 24:25.420
It's good
the bitch is in your blood.

24:25.420 --> 24:27.170
Why?

24:27.170 --> 24:29.080
'Cause that means
you're alive.

24:32.420 --> 24:34.620
Do you know
how much I admire you?

24:34.620 --> 24:37.330
Why? 'Cause my life
is so perfect?

24:37.330 --> 24:39.460
It's not perfect.
That's what I admire.

24:39.460 --> 24:43.460
And you don't pretend it is
or that you're perfect.

24:43.460 --> 24:45.830
You're messy...

24:45.830 --> 24:47.500
and honest.

24:48.540 --> 24:49.500
It can be brutal.

24:51.420 --> 24:54.120
But it makes me
just want to be near you.

24:57.040 --> 24:59.750
I'm glad I know you,
Annalise.

25:18.500 --> 25:21.210
I'm gonna get you some food
to soak up that gin.

25:37.750 --> 25:39.830
How's he doing?

25:39.830 --> 25:41.000
Same.

25:43.120 --> 25:45.380
Our Gabriel problem
is back.

25:45.380 --> 25:47.330
What?

25:47.330 --> 25:51.500
Vivian had tapes
of my therapy with Sam.

25:51.500 --> 25:53.080
Gabriel heard them.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.170
I crossed a line.
I went after him.

25:59.210 --> 26:01.330
No.
He was your doctor.

26:01.330 --> 26:03.670
All this time, I told myself
that I wasn't to blame,

26:03.670 --> 26:05.500
but...

26:05.500 --> 26:07.380
Because that's how
they do it.

26:07.380 --> 26:10.500
They get us to blame ourselves
when it's them.

26:10.500 --> 26:12.500
I was afraid to be gay.

26:17.210 --> 26:21.500
Should've stayed with Eve,
loved her,

26:21.500 --> 26:22.960
but I wanted
to be normal,

26:22.960 --> 26:24.710
I wanted
to be accepted.

26:26.830 --> 26:30.120
So I threw myself at him,
and look where it's gotten us.

26:32.920 --> 26:34.380
Everything bad
that's happened to us

26:34.380 --> 26:36.620
started with Sam,
not you.

26:39.670 --> 26:40.750
Forgive yourself.

26:53.500 --> 26:54.670
Young Annalise: You don't
have to see me again.

26:54.670 --> 26:56.250
Sam: What?
If this was
a mistake...

26:56.250 --> 26:58.670
No. No, this...

26:58.670 --> 27:01.790
this is the best decision
I've made in years.

27:23.670 --> 27:25.330
I get why you would be
so angry.

27:25.330 --> 27:27.460
That tape makes me sound like
a villain.

27:27.460 --> 27:28.670
Because you were.

27:28.670 --> 27:30.960
Listen, I've been
lying to myself for years,

27:30.960 --> 27:32.880
telling myself
that it was all Sam,

27:32.880 --> 27:34.080
that he manipulated me.

27:34.080 --> 27:35.580
So, what's the truth?

27:35.580 --> 27:37.540
Say it.

27:37.540 --> 27:39.380
To his son who was raised
without a father.

27:39.380 --> 27:40.420
Say it right now.

27:40.420 --> 27:41.540
I went after Sam

27:41.540 --> 27:44.380
because I didn't want
to be left alone.

27:47.710 --> 27:49.330
I was just
a few years older

27:49.330 --> 27:50.960
than what you are right now,
Gabriel.

27:50.960 --> 27:52.540
I was a mess.

27:54.920 --> 27:58.380
So, I wanted to be loved,
regardless of who I hurt.

28:00.330 --> 28:03.040
So, you've changed?

28:03.040 --> 28:05.250
That woman on the tape --

28:05.250 --> 28:07.210
you don't...
lie like that anymore?

28:07.210 --> 28:09.420
I hope not.

28:10.790 --> 28:13.710
Then why lie to Michaela
about not knowing her father?

28:22.330 --> 28:24.000
Avoiding Oliver?

28:24.000 --> 28:25.460
Who knew
that he'd turn out to be

28:25.460 --> 28:26.960
the biggest liar
of us all?

28:26.960 --> 28:28.460
Nope.

28:28.460 --> 28:30.960
Apparently, Laurel
still holds that title.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.330
I have to dump Gabriel.

28:35.330 --> 28:36.830
Why?

28:36.830 --> 28:38.670
He took Solomon's side.

28:38.670 --> 28:39.750
Bastard.

28:39.750 --> 28:42.540
You know
who's not a bastard?

28:42.540 --> 28:44.080
Asher.
Asher.

28:47.830 --> 28:49.670
Alright, no more moping.

28:49.670 --> 28:52.790
This...
is a golden ticket.

28:52.790 --> 28:55.000
I say you take the money
and run.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.170
But I want him to suffer.

28:58.170 --> 29:00.250
Like, sue him
for child abandonment

29:00.250 --> 29:01.750
and get him disbarred.

29:01.750 --> 29:03.330
Make it public and messy

29:03.330 --> 29:06.290
and ruin his reputation
and career and life.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.460
What?

29:09.460 --> 29:11.750
Wasn't he, like, our age
when this all happened?

29:11.750 --> 29:13.250
So?

29:13.250 --> 29:14.750
So you'd probably do
the same thing.

29:14.750 --> 29:16.250
Abandon my child?

29:16.250 --> 29:18.330
Choose your career
over everything else.

29:19.710 --> 29:22.620
♪ I know ♪

29:22.620 --> 29:23.710
I hate you.

29:23.710 --> 29:25.670
♪ Who you are ♪

29:25.670 --> 29:27.920
Annalise: I didn't call you here
to talk about Michaela.

29:27.920 --> 29:29.880
I want to tell you
about Sam.

29:29.880 --> 29:31.120
That's why you're here,
right?

29:31.120 --> 29:33.580
So, ask me anything
you want to know about him.

29:33.580 --> 29:36.120
♪ A scratch becomes a scar ♪

29:36.120 --> 29:39.040
Why'd you choose him
over Eve?

29:39.040 --> 29:42.040
♪ A scratch becomes a scar ♪

29:42.040 --> 29:44.540
Because he looked like
a version of life

29:44.540 --> 29:47.750
I'd dreamed about
my whole childhood.

29:47.750 --> 29:52.120
Big house, nice family,
easy smile.

29:54.880 --> 29:57.830
He belonged...

29:57.830 --> 29:59.960
while I never felt
like I did.

30:01.210 --> 30:05.620
♪ I know how to move you ♪

30:05.620 --> 30:06.580
Thanks for coming back.

30:11.750 --> 30:13.500
I have trouble
being honest.

30:14.960 --> 30:17.290
You know that.

30:17.290 --> 30:20.710
Especially when I'm hurt.

30:20.710 --> 30:22.250
And I'm hurt.

♪ You're making me choose ♪

30:23.620 --> 30:25.040
Still.

30:25.040 --> 30:27.120
I wish I could say
I'm over you.

30:27.120 --> 30:30.420
I wish I could just let go
and move on.

30:33.750 --> 30:35.710
But I still miss you.

30:39.750 --> 30:40.960
Tegan...

30:44.330 --> 30:46.420
...I don't miss you.

30:46.420 --> 30:48.540
It's brutal for me
to say that, I know.

30:48.540 --> 30:50.580
I know that.

30:50.580 --> 30:53.330
But I haven't missed you
for a while.

30:54.710 --> 30:56.210
Even before Patrick.

30:56.210 --> 30:58.290
Look, I didn't want
to hurt you,

30:58.290 --> 31:01.250
so I made it about him,
but...

31:01.250 --> 31:04.710
God's honest is...

31:04.710 --> 31:07.790
I wasn't in love with you
anymore.

31:07.790 --> 31:09.120
And I'm not
in love with you now.

31:10.710 --> 31:12.580
It's over, Tea.

31:12.580 --> 31:14.710
We're over.

31:16.790 --> 31:18.790
♪ You fail ♪

31:18.790 --> 31:20.750
Thank you for telling me.

31:20.750 --> 31:23.170
Annalise:
Sam never stopped pushing me.

31:23.170 --> 31:26.290
He pushed me
to want to know myself,

31:26.290 --> 31:28.920
to admit
that I wanted a family...

31:32.330 --> 31:34.210
...children...

31:34.210 --> 31:36.330
things I believed
I never could have.

31:36.330 --> 31:38.250
Chloe: They're not
good people, Asher.

31:38.250 --> 31:39.790
You met them
for five minutes.

31:39.790 --> 31:41.250
I have a good gut
about these things,

31:41.250 --> 31:43.620
and those people
are bad news.

31:43.620 --> 31:45.500
I think you're confusing them
with Mom and Dad.

31:45.500 --> 31:46.670
See?

31:46.670 --> 31:47.920
The Asher I knew before

31:47.920 --> 31:49.830
would never say something
as hideous as that.

31:49.830 --> 31:51.250
Those bad people
were there for me

31:51.250 --> 31:53.500
when no one was,
including you.

31:53.500 --> 31:55.540
But will they be there for you
after law school?

31:55.540 --> 31:57.380
Yeah.
I think that they will.
You think?

31:57.380 --> 31:59.620
Because I think you're doing
what you did with Dad --

31:59.620 --> 32:01.540
becoming some person you're not
to fit in and be liked.

32:01.540 --> 32:03.080
That's your M.O.

32:03.080 --> 32:05.120
You're so desperate to be
accepted that you don't realize

32:05.120 --> 32:06.960
the people
whose approval you want

32:06.960 --> 32:08.710
don't deserve yours.

32:08.710 --> 32:11.120
You don't know who I am
anymore, Chloe.

32:12.420 --> 32:14.880
I know you're not happy.

32:14.880 --> 32:16.920
I mean,
look at your eyes.

32:16.920 --> 32:19.710
They're sad eyes,
baby brother.

32:19.710 --> 32:21.000
Meanwhile,
you're pushing away

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
the people
who actually love you --

32:23.000 --> 32:24.620
me, Mom.

32:24.620 --> 32:25.710
We're your family.

32:25.710 --> 32:27.710
And we need you so bad
right now.

32:27.710 --> 32:28.620
Not just Mom.

32:30.250 --> 32:32.120
Me too.

32:33.460 --> 32:35.750
So, please,
just come home.

32:36.960 --> 32:38.670
Give us another chance.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.880
Annalise:
But then, I wasn't enough.

32:44.330 --> 32:45.750
Sam wanted more.

32:45.750 --> 32:48.000
You.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.790
That's why I never stopped
trying to give him a child.

32:51.790 --> 32:54.500
Because he wanted you.

32:56.830 --> 32:59.500
He wanted you, Gabriel.

32:59.500 --> 33:01.750
He loved you.

33:08.420 --> 33:10.460
Oliver: You ever gonna sleep
in the same room as me again?

33:10.460 --> 33:12.880
Why didn't you tell me?

33:12.880 --> 33:14.790
I was just doing
what Frank asked.

33:16.580 --> 33:18.960
I'm your husband.

33:18.960 --> 33:22.210
And you knew how guilty
I felt about Christopher.

33:23.880 --> 33:26.170
So why not say something?

33:26.170 --> 33:29.000
I mean, you --
you can tell me anything

33:29.000 --> 33:30.960
and -- and I can take it
because we're married,

33:30.960 --> 33:32.500
and I don't want
to get divorced yet,

33:32.500 --> 33:34.710
even though
I'm really angry right now.

33:34.710 --> 33:35.750
I knew
you would tell Annalise.

33:35.750 --> 33:37.040
No, I wouldn't!

33:41.080 --> 33:43.000
I don't know
if I believe that.

33:44.210 --> 33:45.290
So, you don't trust me?

33:45.290 --> 33:46.540
No.
That's what you're saying?

33:46.540 --> 33:49.500
I mean, after everything
we've been through together?

33:49.500 --> 33:51.790
Your husband, who loves you
more than anything in the world,

33:51.790 --> 33:52.830
you don't trust me?

33:52.830 --> 33:54.330
I'm just being honest.

33:54.330 --> 33:56.420
That's part
of being married, too.

34:06.380 --> 34:07.580
Did Frank die?

34:08.540 --> 34:09.960
It's Ravi.

34:09.960 --> 34:13.330
He wants to...come over
for a second round.

34:26.170 --> 34:27.420
Hey.

34:27.420 --> 34:28.580
Hey.

34:30.040 --> 34:31.830
It's me.

34:31.830 --> 34:34.330
It's me.

34:37.960 --> 34:39.210
We need a nurse here!

34:39.210 --> 34:41.120
Please! Hurry up!

34:48.380 --> 34:49.380
Hi.

34:49.380 --> 34:51.960
Annalise?

34:51.960 --> 34:54.120
You have to come
right away.

35:01.250 --> 35:02.830
What happened?

35:02.830 --> 35:04.290
He's awake.

35:04.290 --> 35:06.210
Okay. Is he okay?

35:06.210 --> 35:07.830
Talk.

35:07.830 --> 35:09.710
He was saying "Laurel"
to you.

35:09.710 --> 35:11.620
What?

35:11.620 --> 35:13.710
He was saying "Laurel"
to you

35:13.710 --> 35:15.790
because you helped her
disappear.

35:19.790 --> 35:21.040
Guard: Hey.

35:35.080 --> 35:36.330
Ahhhhhh.

35:36.330 --> 35:37.790
Finally makes sense.

35:39.420 --> 35:40.460
What?

35:40.460 --> 35:42.040
How Laurel got away.

35:44.120 --> 35:45.210
It was Annalise.

35:46.420 --> 35:48.080
Bonnie: Laurel paid you
to help her.

35:48.080 --> 35:49.250
No!

35:49.250 --> 35:50.830
Do not lie to me.

35:50.830 --> 35:52.290
Xavier told Frank that,

35:52.290 --> 35:54.250
and you two are dumb enough
to believe it?

35:54.250 --> 35:55.830
Where did you
get the money, then?

35:55.830 --> 35:58.830
Xavier: It's Annalise's
secret bank account.

35:58.830 --> 35:59.790
You didn't know, did you?

36:01.210 --> 36:03.880
There's no proof
that money came from Laurel.

36:03.880 --> 36:05.670
Bermuda North Atlantic Bank.

36:05.670 --> 36:07.540
It's where my family does
all their offshore business.

36:07.540 --> 36:08.920
My dad, me, Laurel.

36:08.920 --> 36:10.710
$208,000.

36:12.710 --> 36:15.330
That's a whole lot of cash
to come up with out of nowhere.

36:15.330 --> 36:16.960
Annalise:
That's my money.

36:16.960 --> 36:18.580
From where?
C&G.

36:18.580 --> 36:20.580
I got them to give me
my bonus.

36:20.580 --> 36:22.250
Why wouldn't you tell me that?

36:22.250 --> 36:24.620
Because it's for me.

36:24.620 --> 36:27.210
Okay, for when Nate or Gabriel
or you turn on me,

36:27.210 --> 36:29.120
I can get the hell out of here
and actually live.

36:29.120 --> 36:31.620
Xavier: You honestly think
Annalise cares about you?

36:31.620 --> 36:33.380
She only cares
about herself.

36:33.380 --> 36:36.170
And you've been her loyal dog
long enough.

36:36.170 --> 36:38.290
Annalise knows
where Laurel is, Frank.

36:39.880 --> 36:41.960
You can help me
find her.

36:41.960 --> 36:44.620
Annalise: This is
exactly what Xavier wants.

36:44.620 --> 36:46.790
He tortured Frank
to torture us,

36:46.790 --> 36:48.000
and it's working.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.460
That's how
we're all gonna go down.

36:49.460 --> 36:51.830
Not because we got beat,
but because we...

36:53.290 --> 36:55.670
...we beat ourselves.

36:57.290 --> 36:58.790
Bonnie.

36:58.790 --> 37:00.710
Bonnie.

37:13.330 --> 37:14.080
Don't.

37:16.250 --> 37:17.580
I'm fine.

37:20.290 --> 37:21.790
Okay.

37:34.040 --> 37:36.880
I'm fine.

37:36.880 --> 37:38.920
I'm fine. I'm fine.

39:47.250 --> 39:49.170

We have a dead informant

41:51.170 --> 41:52.080
Stop right there,
ma'am.

41:52.080 --> 41:53.750
I'm here
on behalf of my client.

41:53.750 --> 41:55.880
This is a closed crime scene.
No lawyers allowed.

41:55.880 --> 41:57.620
I represent a suspect
in this case,

41:57.620 --> 41:59.500
so you better believe
I'm going up those stairs

41:59.500 --> 42:01.920
before you plant evidence
or destroy DNA.

42:01.920 --> 42:03.790
Ma'am,
we are following protocol.

42:03.790 --> 42:05.000
Like I trust you.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.880
Is the body still there?
I can't share that.

42:06.880 --> 42:09.000
Because you're messing
with a corpse to make
my client look guilty?

42:09.000 --> 42:10.540
Ma'am, I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave,

42:10.540 --> 42:11.750
or I will call
my captain.
Try it.

42:11.750 --> 42:13.080
I'll sue your ass,

42:13.080 --> 42:14.960
and my client
will get off scot-free.

42:14.960 --> 42:16.670
You'll have made my day.
