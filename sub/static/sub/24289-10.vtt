WEBVTT

00:11.011 --> 00:12.804
So Vera, I was thinking...

00:13.430 --> 00:16.015
you and me should
spend some time together.

00:16.391 --> 00:17.726
You and me or you and I?

00:18.101 --> 00:21.230
I was thinking you and I should
spend some time together.

00:21.313 --> 00:22.648
Time or quality time?

00:22.898 --> 00:25.525
So Vera, I was thinking
you and I should spend

00:25.609 --> 00:27.236
some quality time together.

00:27.319 --> 00:28.487
Just the two of us.

00:28.570 --> 00:29.738
We could go see a movie?

00:29.821 --> 00:32.031
No, a movie is no good.
You can't talk during a movie.

00:35.118 --> 00:37.287
...quality time together, you and I...

00:38.705 --> 00:40.165
Just the two of us.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.793
We could go for some pizza, and then...

00:42.876 --> 00:44.044
Parker?

00:46.171 --> 00:47.464
Hey, Vera.

00:48.590 --> 00:51.134
Uh, I didn't know you were...
How long have you...

00:51.218 --> 00:52.678
Were you talking to someone?

00:54.680 --> 00:56.765
Actually, um... Hey, Vera.

00:56.932 --> 00:58.350
I was thinking...

00:59.268 --> 01:01.270
You know, if you wanted to...

01:01.520 --> 01:03.456
- Or we could do something...
- Are you all right, Parker?

01:03.480 --> 01:05.107
You seem especially nervous.

01:05.357 --> 01:09.611
Not... Not nerv...
No, uh... Not me, uh...

01:09.778 --> 01:11.446
You just caught me off guard, that's all.

01:11.613 --> 01:13.173
I'm sorry if my presence has upset you.

01:13.282 --> 01:14.700
Oh, no, no, no. That's not what...

01:14.783 --> 01:18.745
No, I uh... Trust me, the more
present you are the better.

01:19.288 --> 01:22.457
I mean, I like it when you're around.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.085
I like when you're around, too.

01:25.252 --> 01:26.503
Really?

01:26.670 --> 01:28.046
Of course.

01:29.298 --> 01:30.465
That's awesome.

01:31.133 --> 01:32.718
I mean, yeah, cool.

01:32.801 --> 01:34.177
Cool. Right.

01:34.344 --> 01:35.679
So, Vera.

01:36.013 --> 01:37.373
I was thinking you and I should...

01:38.557 --> 01:39.599
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

01:39.808 --> 01:40.808
Hello, Trey.

01:41.476 --> 01:42.769
Oh, hey.

01:42.978 --> 01:43.979
Hi, Trey.

01:44.146 --> 01:45.897
Were the Codebreakers triumphant?

01:46.023 --> 01:48.650
<i>Yeah, we won the game,
but it was a squeaker.</i>

01:49.067 --> 01:50.787
<i>I'm actually on my way
to the bus right now.</i>

01:51.111 --> 01:52.711
<i>We're still on for tonight, right, Vera?</i>

01:53.113 --> 01:54.823
Yes, of course.

01:55.532 --> 01:58.702
Well, I guess
congratulations are in order.

01:58.910 --> 01:59.910
<i>What do you mean?</i>

02:00.037 --> 02:01.204
The basketball game?

02:01.330 --> 02:02.748
What else would I mean?

02:03.165 --> 02:05.542
You know, I'm sure
you scored like 100 points, right?

02:05.667 --> 02:09.545
Got like a gazillion assists,
rebounds and touchdowns and...

02:10.464 --> 02:12.049
<i>Yeah, not even close.</i>

02:12.132 --> 02:13.175
<i>I shot terribly.</i>

02:13.258 --> 02:17.304
<i>I only had 26 points,
a few assists and eight boards.</i>

02:17.888 --> 02:20.448
<i>But the other guys stepped up.
The team's really coming together.</i>

02:20.682 --> 02:22.893
<i>- I gotta go. Uh, see you later.</i>
- Goodbye.

02:24.436 --> 02:26.063
Only 26 points.

02:26.271 --> 02:29.274
God. Even on an off day
that guy's on fire.

02:29.941 --> 02:31.026
Yes.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.737
Trey is on pace to become
Alan Turing High's leading scorer

02:33.820 --> 02:35.238
in just one season.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.199
Go team Trey, right?

02:37.866 --> 02:39.159
Rah.

02:41.953 --> 02:43.372
Megabyte alert.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.539
The virus is on the move.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:57.677 --> 03:00.013
Bring the cyber catapult forward.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.231
Prepare to launch!

03:13.402 --> 03:14.736
Fire!

03:20.951 --> 03:24.079
Oh. If at first you don't succeed...

03:24.538 --> 03:25.664
Fire!

03:33.588 --> 03:35.132
Excellent.

03:37.259 --> 03:38.343
Guard the entrance.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.345
The rest of you, follow me.

03:40.512 --> 03:41.763
Yes, Megabyte.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.769
Vector. Enigma.

03:47.853 --> 03:50.522
Megabyte has been located
in a remote sector.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.065
Your patrol is over.

03:52.149 --> 03:53.358
I will reroute the codec.

03:53.442 --> 03:54.860
<i>Okay, Vera. Set the course.</i>

03:54.943 --> 03:56.194
<i>We'll check it out.</i>

03:56.778 --> 03:58.029
Coordinates are locked in.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.399
Megabyte must have gone in there.

04:07.456 --> 04:09.332
Yeah. I wonder what's inside.

04:09.416 --> 04:12.085
Probably something important
if he brought the warship.

04:12.294 --> 04:13.670
You mean the sitting duck?

04:15.088 --> 04:16.630
Fire!

04:23.263 --> 04:24.598
- That was easy.
- Yeah.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.600
- Zip board!
- Stealth glider!

04:26.683 --> 04:28.683
Now, let's find out
what Megabyte's up to.

04:35.692 --> 04:40.322
So many moods and no one
to inflict them upon.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.282
Hexadecimal.

04:43.742 --> 04:46.036
You're looking as terrifying as ever.

04:47.245 --> 04:49.247
Could it be?

04:49.456 --> 04:51.166
What's this?

04:51.249 --> 04:55.128
No affectionate greeting
for your own brother?

05:06.473 --> 05:09.100
Well, sister.
What do you think?

05:09.643 --> 05:13.688
The pompous voice, the condescending tone,

05:14.064 --> 05:15.857
you sound like Megabyte

05:15.982 --> 05:18.777
but you don't look like Megabyte.

05:18.902 --> 05:22.030
I am the upgraded, improved version.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.866
A Megabyte for a new millennium.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.955
Now, now, Hexadecimal, play nice.

05:30.288 --> 05:33.959
I've seen a world beyond
your wildest partition setting.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.586
I'm here to share it with you.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.672
Do I have a choice?

05:39.047 --> 05:41.299
Well, I could command
my sentinels to seize you

05:41.383 --> 05:44.052
and throw you in my dungeon
for all eternity,

05:44.344 --> 05:47.097
which would certainly give me pleasure,

05:47.430 --> 05:52.602
or you can join me in a new viral dawn.

05:52.894 --> 05:56.231
Conniving. Manipulative. Self-serving.

05:56.565 --> 06:01.194
Now that's the Megabyte I know and loathe.

06:06.992 --> 06:08.326
Hey, Vera, what's going on?

06:08.451 --> 06:09.536
I'm trying to determine...

06:10.912 --> 06:11.913
Did you just beep?

06:12.122 --> 06:13.248
Yes.

06:13.331 --> 06:15.000
I'm tracking Vector and Enigma.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.960
Their location in cyberspace

06:17.043 --> 06:19.254
corresponds to a real world location.

06:19.337 --> 06:20.856
Yeah, I get that. But why are you beeping?

06:20.880 --> 06:22.799
The signal has never been

06:22.882 --> 06:24.134
so strong.

06:24.301 --> 06:25.501
It's almost as if

06:25.552 --> 06:26.886
they're in...

06:28.722 --> 06:30.056
This room.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.560
- In this room?
- Yes.

06:34.311 --> 06:35.478
No way.

06:35.854 --> 06:37.230
It's getting stronger.

06:37.731 --> 06:38.731
In this direction.

06:43.486 --> 06:44.487
What's even back here?

06:50.243 --> 06:51.411
This is the spot.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.209
Whoa.

06:58.460 --> 07:00.086
This is an old mainframe computer.

07:01.171 --> 07:02.756
Did you know this was here, Vera?

07:02.964 --> 07:04.049
No.

07:04.716 --> 07:08.136
It must have been installed by
Austin's father when he set up the room.

07:10.847 --> 07:12.182
It's in power saver mode.

07:21.191 --> 07:22.901
Whoa. Who turned on the lights?

07:23.109 --> 07:24.527
I think I did!

07:25.528 --> 07:28.156
You guys are inside
an old mainframe computer in room zero.

07:28.573 --> 07:31.910
Wow. It's like ancient technology
one point retro.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.206
This thing's like a collector's item.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.390
No way!

07:53.890 --> 07:55.350
Is this for real?

08:01.439 --> 08:02.482
Yes!

08:04.943 --> 08:06.111
It is!

08:06.236 --> 08:08.655
After 20 years of waiting,
it's finally happened.

08:09.781 --> 08:11.700
Mainframe is back online.

08:15.370 --> 08:16.413
Check it out.

08:17.706 --> 08:19.582
It looks like a diner.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.710
- It's...
- Under my protection.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.088
Back off, blue boy.

08:26.881 --> 08:27.966
Blue boy?

08:28.049 --> 08:29.467
I am Bob.

08:29.634 --> 08:32.929
I come from the 'net, through
systems, peoples and cities,

08:33.013 --> 08:35.097
to this place, Mainframe.

08:35.306 --> 08:37.142
My format? Guardian.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.684
"To mend and defend."

08:38.893 --> 08:39.894
You're a guardian?

08:40.186 --> 08:41.813
Cool! So are we. Look.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.481
Then why are your faces hidden?

08:43.565 --> 08:44.941
Take off those masks.

08:45.233 --> 08:46.860
We can't. Long story.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.528
But trust us, we're guardians, too.

08:48.737 --> 08:50.363
Next generation guardians.

08:50.572 --> 08:52.115
We come from outside the 'net.

08:52.282 --> 08:53.450
Outside the 'net?

08:53.533 --> 08:55.660
They say the user lives outside the 'net

08:55.744 --> 08:57.662
and inputs games for pleasure.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.622
No one knows for sure.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.541
Well, it's true.

09:01.624 --> 09:02.709
I knew it!

09:04.711 --> 09:06.087
What's going on, Bob?

09:06.212 --> 09:08.548
Dot, Enzo, you'll never believe it.

09:08.631 --> 09:10.133
These two say they're guardians

09:10.216 --> 09:12.677
but they're also users
from outside the 'net!

09:12.927 --> 09:13.970
Alphanumeric!

09:14.054 --> 09:15.889
Hey! This place is awesome.

09:16.264 --> 09:18.016
Bob, don't. He's with us.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.393
Googz, what're you doing here?

09:20.477 --> 09:21.394
Thought you guys could use some help.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.605
Besides, there's no point
in me staying with Vera.

09:24.314 --> 09:25.523
I'm no basketball hero.

09:26.191 --> 09:27.484
- What?
- Never mind.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.319
Have you guys found Megabyte?

09:29.444 --> 09:31.071
Megabyte?

09:31.196 --> 09:32.197
That's why we're here.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.823
To catch that virus.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.911
Coolness! Any enemy of Megabreath
is a friend of ours.

09:38.161 --> 09:41.915
Do you have any idea
where Megabreath might be?

09:44.876 --> 09:46.461
Lost Angles is just up ahead.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.296
That's where Hexadecimal's lair is.

09:48.463 --> 09:49.839
I'm guessing Megabyte's there.

09:50.006 --> 09:51.049
Good guess.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.136
Those are Megabyte's sentinels.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.639
How fortuitous.

09:57.722 --> 10:00.975
It seems you will get to meet
the new breed of guardians

10:01.059 --> 10:05.730
as well as renew acquaintances
with your old favorite, Bob.

10:06.189 --> 10:08.817
Ooh, good.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.735
Sentinels! Attack!

10:18.660 --> 10:22.664
Oh, Bob, it's so good to see you again.

10:22.914 --> 10:24.916
Have you been working out?

10:25.041 --> 10:26.835
What are you doing, Hexadecimal?

10:26.918 --> 10:28.336
You know you can't trust Megabyte.

10:28.419 --> 10:29.420
I know.

10:29.504 --> 10:31.631
But he is family.

10:36.010 --> 10:37.178
Same old Hex.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.109
The guardians need a plan if they're going

10:51.192 --> 10:53.444
to defeat Megabyte and Hexadecimal.

10:55.363 --> 10:57.115
So far they're doing okay.

11:06.249 --> 11:08.126
<i>Starship Alcatraz.</i>

11:08.793 --> 11:10.587
How long has it been?

11:15.967 --> 11:17.135
Bob.

11:17.218 --> 11:19.345
Time to finally finish you.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.601
Megabyte hates you even
more than he hates us.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.811
We've got history. Give it time.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.980
<i>Warning, incoming game.</i>

11:30.773 --> 11:33.109
<i>Warning, incoming game.</i>

11:33.568 --> 11:35.695
Not a game! Not now!

11:40.783 --> 11:41.868
Where are we?

11:42.827 --> 11:43.912
What's going on?

11:43.995 --> 11:45.538
We're inside a game.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.665
It's our job to win it.

11:48.207 --> 11:49.208
And if we don't?

11:49.709 --> 11:50.960
It's game over.

11:59.385 --> 12:02.055
Take one final look, dear sister.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.474
I will miss this Mainframe.

12:04.557 --> 12:07.018
So many memories.

12:07.101 --> 12:10.605
Yes, but beyond Mainframe
lies a vast cyberverse

12:10.688 --> 12:12.190
for us to corrupt.

12:15.276 --> 12:17.403
Your corrupting days are over, Megabyte.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.322
Oh, on the contrary.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.157
They are just beginning!

12:28.164 --> 12:30.458
Hey! A girl guardian.

12:30.625 --> 12:31.834
The name's "Enigma."

12:32.001 --> 12:35.129
Pleased to delete you.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.760
Well done, dear sister.

12:40.843 --> 12:42.387
Well done!

12:44.973 --> 12:46.641
Enigma! Are you okay?

12:46.724 --> 12:48.309
No. I had her!

12:48.601 --> 12:52.146
Hexadecimal is totally random
and has crazy powers!

12:52.438 --> 12:53.439
Now you tell me.

12:54.065 --> 12:55.608
What happened to Vector and Googz?

12:55.692 --> 12:57.902
They're inside the game with Bob!

12:58.027 --> 13:00.655
Well, let's get them out.
Energy shurikens!

13:04.158 --> 13:05.868
You can't help them now.

13:08.371 --> 13:09.539
Who's that?

13:09.622 --> 13:10.915
The user.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.793
This is gonna be too easy.

13:14.293 --> 13:17.005
My player will escape
<i>Starship Alcatraz</i> first!

13:18.297 --> 13:20.466
<i>Danger. Prison cell breech.</i>

13:20.883 --> 13:23.594
<i>Self-destruct sequence initiated.</i>

13:23.678 --> 13:24.678
Reboot!

13:27.890 --> 13:29.600
Uh, what just happened?

13:29.726 --> 13:31.853
When you're in a game you reboot
so you get the powers

13:31.936 --> 13:33.730
and weapons you need to win.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.356
You have to reboot.

13:35.690 --> 13:36.834
I don't think we can do that.

13:36.858 --> 13:38.985
I'll give it a try. Reboot!

13:40.903 --> 13:42.280
Nope. Nothing.

13:42.363 --> 13:43.781
Too bad. I wanted an eye patch.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.285
Code disruptor!

13:48.411 --> 13:49.412
What gives?

13:52.915 --> 13:54.542
Are you sure you're guardians?

13:54.625 --> 13:58.171
Yes, but... I think this game
is messing with our powers.

13:58.421 --> 13:59.547
Yeah, this game's old.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.174
Like 64 bit old.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.884
Well, the user is way ahead of us.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.595
Come on. We have to beat him
or we get nullified.

14:05.720 --> 14:06.846
That doesn't sound good.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.432
No, it's bad. Very bad.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.479
Enigma, what's happening?

14:14.771 --> 14:16.731
I can't reach Vector and Googz.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.524
There's too much interference.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.401
<i>They're trapped in a game, Vera.</i>

14:20.693 --> 14:22.445
- Can you get them out?
- <i>No.</i>

14:23.071 --> 14:26.491
<i>Apparently they have to beat whoever
is playing the game in the real world.</i>

14:26.783 --> 14:28.951
So close.

14:29.744 --> 14:31.204
Just one more level.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.708
Whoa! Who's shooting at us?

14:35.875 --> 14:38.294
The self-destruct sequence
sets off all kinds of traps

14:38.378 --> 14:40.463
to stop us and the user from escaping.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.216
Deflector ring!

14:43.299 --> 14:44.217
Yikes!

14:44.300 --> 14:46.302
Okay, so my deflector ring's not working.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.055
I can still do this!

14:53.601 --> 14:54.727
Spider eyes.

14:55.978 --> 14:56.978
I know this game!

14:57.271 --> 14:58.591
What're you talking about, Googz?

15:01.150 --> 15:02.193
What's the deal?

15:02.276 --> 15:04.195
We need to get as many
spider eyes as we can.

15:04.487 --> 15:06.114
That's not how you win.

15:06.197 --> 15:09.325
Listen, me and Vector,
we've played this game as users.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.160
- We have?
- Yes, with your dad.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.871
Trust me. Spider eyes are our best chance.

15:14.622 --> 15:17.792
I hope you're right,
'cause right now we're losing.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.919
I'm finally gonna win!

15:20.378 --> 15:23.172
And mom said all this time
in the basement was wasted!

15:24.132 --> 15:26.843
<i>Self-destruct in 30 seconds.</i>

15:31.931 --> 15:33.599
We need more spider eyes!

15:34.183 --> 15:35.518
Coming right up.

15:44.735 --> 15:45.736
Now what?

15:47.196 --> 15:48.531
It's back to the control room.

15:53.494 --> 15:54.579
I guess it's our turn.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.877
Come on! We have to slot in
all the spider eyes!

16:01.377 --> 16:04.130
<i>Self-destruct in 15 seconds.</i>

16:04.213 --> 16:05.213
They're gonna make it.

16:05.339 --> 16:06.507
I know they are.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.931
Yes!

16:14.515 --> 16:15.515
Yes!

16:16.225 --> 16:18.186
<i>Self-destruct in five seconds.</i>

16:18.269 --> 16:19.269
We need one more!

16:21.063 --> 16:22.648
- <i>Four.</i>
- Bob, over there!

16:22.857 --> 16:23.983
<i>Three.</i>

16:24.358 --> 16:26.861
<i>Two. One.</i>

16:28.321 --> 16:29.405
I won!

16:29.489 --> 16:30.656
Yes!

16:30.740 --> 16:31.824
Yes!

16:38.498 --> 16:40.500
I told you they were gonna win!

16:40.625 --> 16:41.959
Whoa!

16:43.544 --> 16:45.922
<i>Game over. You lose.</i>

16:46.005 --> 16:47.215
No.

16:48.299 --> 16:50.259
I was so close!

16:54.597 --> 16:57.391
You next gen guardians
sure play a different game.

16:57.642 --> 17:00.895
So, you were about to lose,
but then you won!

17:00.978 --> 17:02.396
How'd you do that?

17:02.480 --> 17:03.481
I knew a cheat code.

17:03.648 --> 17:05.608
Vector's dad showed it to us
when we were kids.

17:05.816 --> 17:08.569
Yeah. Like a get out of jail free card.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.700
I'm just glad you're safe.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.786
Aw, get a sector!

17:17.161 --> 17:19.372
I think that's our cue to go.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.500
Vector, Googz, Enigma.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.042
It was an honor.

17:24.126 --> 17:26.295
We'll do our best to mend and defend.

17:26.503 --> 17:27.713
Stealth glider.

17:27.797 --> 17:29.131
Quadra disc.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.591
Zip board.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.053
Stay frosty!

17:34.470 --> 17:37.139
Looks like cyberspace is in good hands.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.156
I still can't believe it.

17:54.574 --> 17:57.952
Bob, Dot, and Enzo are inside
my dad's mainframe computer.

17:58.035 --> 18:00.162
And it was in room zero the entire time.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.748
I guess that means
we can check in on them whenever we want.

18:04.292 --> 18:06.127
Sorry I missed all the action, guys.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.890
I really wish I coulda been there to help.

18:08.004 --> 18:09.338
We were fine without you.

18:09.672 --> 18:10.672
No, we weren't.

18:10.965 --> 18:12.717
Megabyte and Hexadecimal got away.

18:13.718 --> 18:14.844
Thanks to me.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.597
It wasn't your fault.

18:18.973 --> 18:20.182
Yes, it was.

18:20.808 --> 18:22.810
"Mend and defend."

18:23.603 --> 18:25.062
I didn't do either.

18:25.313 --> 18:28.316
Not every mission results in
a 100 percent positive outcome.

18:29.817 --> 18:32.445
Yeah. I mean, it's like basketball.
You can't win every game.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.697
Except you
are winning every game.

18:36.073 --> 18:37.158
Okay, true.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.285
But sometimes, like today, just barely.

18:41.329 --> 18:45.708
Tell me about it. We won that
<i>Starship Alcatraz</i> game at the last second.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.084
Last millisecond.

18:47.168 --> 18:50.421
Hey, dude, how'd you remember
that cheat code with the spider eyes?

18:51.005 --> 18:52.548
Come on. Your dad showed it to us.

18:53.424 --> 18:54.901
Obviously you paid way more attention

18:54.925 --> 18:56.218
to that stuff than I did.

18:56.302 --> 18:57.720
I took notes.

18:58.054 --> 19:00.097
He had a ton of cool game tips and tricks.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.492
I think you used to come over to my house

19:02.516 --> 19:04.435
to hang out with him instead of me.

19:05.269 --> 19:06.854
Oh, for sure. He was way more fun.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.025
You ready?

19:11.192 --> 19:12.443
Yes. Good idea.

19:17.365 --> 19:18.824
Where are you going, Vera?

19:19.283 --> 19:20.368
You live here.

19:21.327 --> 19:22.327
Oh.

19:25.039 --> 19:27.625
- Trey and I...
- Actually, I don't wanna know.

19:28.751 --> 19:30.086
Okay.

19:30.795 --> 19:32.296
See you guys tomorrow.

19:40.304 --> 19:41.555
Story of my life, right?

19:42.473 --> 19:46.602
I'm on the sidelines while
a super jock gets the girl.

19:49.980 --> 19:52.233
Dude, I don't think
Vera's programmed that way.

19:58.406 --> 20:00.491
What's up with you?
You've been quiet all night.

20:02.827 --> 20:05.663
I told you... Megabyte and Hexadecimal.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.124
Hey, come on.

20:08.416 --> 20:10.176
Don't let what happened
in Mainframe bug you.

20:11.001 --> 20:12.086
We'll get Megabozo

20:12.211 --> 20:15.297
and Hexadecimal is just
some nasty malware.

20:15.965 --> 20:17.341
We'll take her down next time.

20:18.592 --> 20:21.262
You didn't see her up close like I did.

20:23.347 --> 20:24.765
That chick's scary.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.310
Lovely space.

20:28.769 --> 20:31.772
It could use a splash of color
and some mirrors.

20:31.856 --> 20:33.524
It is fine as it is.

20:34.483 --> 20:37.862
Now, I am in need of a new Alpha Sentinel.

20:40.072 --> 20:44.493
Enjoy your promotion...
while it lasts.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.329
What's your name, big boy?

20:47.788 --> 20:49.123
Leave him be.

20:49.206 --> 20:51.375
He cannot afford to be distracted.

20:51.459 --> 20:53.711
Same old Megabyte.

20:53.794 --> 20:56.297
All work and no play.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.674
Yes, exactly.

20:59.467 --> 21:02.762
And there is much work to be
done before I,

21:03.012 --> 21:07.600
or rather, we will rule all of cyberspace.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.770
Ooh, I like the sound of that.
