WEBVTT

00:09.509 --> 00:11.602
Hey, Nat,
someone keeps taking down

00:11.644 --> 00:13.544
my Roger Corman Film Festival
posters.

00:13.580 --> 00:15.639
It was me.
I figured four was enough.

00:15.682 --> 00:16.910
Never enough!

00:16.950 --> 00:18.349
Come on, I'm doing
this for course credit

00:18.385 --> 00:20.080
in Film Theory,
and promotion counts.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.951
Not to mention the king himself,

00:21.988 --> 00:24.320
the pope of pulp is coming
here to bless the event.

00:24.357 --> 00:27.190
Oh. Excuse me if I don't
kiss his ring.

00:27.227 --> 00:28.455
What's the matter?

00:28.495 --> 00:30.190
Too lowbrow for you.

00:30.230 --> 00:31.822
Check out some of these movies...
look at this.

00:31.865 --> 00:34.993
Machine Gun Kelly,
Swamp Woman. The Undead.

00:35.101 --> 00:36.227
Very impressive, Steve.

00:38.071 --> 00:40.335
Everybody's a critic.

00:44.444 --> 00:46.378
Hotel stationery.

00:46.413 --> 00:47.937
Let me guess, your father.

00:47.981 --> 00:49.005
He's coming in tomorrow.

00:49.115 --> 00:50.412
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

00:50.450 --> 00:53.283
- I just got the letter today.
- Typical.

00:53.319 --> 00:55.014
What are you going
to do about it?

00:55.055 --> 00:56.113
I don't know.

00:56.156 --> 00:57.783
He wants me to meet him
at the airport.

00:57.824 --> 01:00.486
Probably so he'll have someone
to talk to during his layover.

01:00.527 --> 01:02.518
That's not it.

01:02.562 --> 01:03.620
He's coming here to stay.

01:03.663 --> 01:04.959
For how long?

01:04.998 --> 01:06.966
He says he's moving here.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.694
And you believe him?

01:08.735 --> 01:10.293
Why shouldn't I?

01:10.336 --> 01:12.133
Let me see...

01:12.172 --> 01:14.072
I could give you
21 years of reasons.

01:14.107 --> 01:17.133
Why are you always this way
when it comes to him?

01:17.177 --> 01:19.168
Because he's done nothing
but disappoint you

01:19.212 --> 01:20.509
since the day you were born.

01:20.547 --> 01:21.775
That is not true.

01:21.815 --> 01:24.807
Honey, you have always worn
rose-colored glasses

01:24.851 --> 01:26.148
when it comes to your father.

01:26.186 --> 01:27.983
I just don't want you
to be hurt again.

01:28.021 --> 01:30.148
Mom, he came to my graduation.
I didn't even ask him.

01:30.190 --> 01:32.090
Well, when you have
such low expectations,

01:32.125 --> 01:33.649
I guess any crumb is a meal.

01:33.693 --> 01:36.992
He's taken good care of me.

01:37.063 --> 01:38.587
And let's face it,

01:38.631 --> 01:41.498
you haven't exactly been
the model mother or wife.

01:41.534 --> 01:45.630
Well, if you mean by
"taking good care of you,"

01:45.672 --> 01:47.264
that you always had plenty
of money, fine.

01:47.307 --> 01:50.037
Just don't come crying to me
when he breaks your heart again.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:22.435 --> 03:24.164
Excuse me.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.967
Hi, is Bill Taylor's
plane in yet?

03:26.039 --> 03:27.472
- It just landed.
- Oh, great.

03:27.507 --> 03:29.202
You can meet him
outside if you like.

03:29.242 --> 03:30.607
Thanks.

03:58.771 --> 03:59.863
Daddy!

03:59.906 --> 04:02.898
Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly!

04:05.545 --> 04:07.103
Hello!

04:07.146 --> 04:08.204
Hi.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.476
Oh, you look great.

04:09.515 --> 04:10.675
No, you look great.

04:10.717 --> 04:12.241
How's my favorite girl, huh?

04:12.285 --> 04:13.309
Happy her dad's back.

04:13.353 --> 04:14.684
Ah.

04:14.721 --> 04:15.813
Oh, uh, thanks, Dave.

04:15.855 --> 04:18.322
See the rest of my stuff
gets back to the hotel.

04:18.358 --> 04:19.450
I'm going with my daughter.

04:28.334 --> 04:29.358
So, how's school?

04:29.402 --> 04:30.733
Good.

04:30.770 --> 04:31.896
Studying psychology, huh?

04:31.938 --> 04:33.269
Yeah.

04:33.306 --> 04:35.934
Well, you've got a whole family
of lunatics to draw on.

04:35.975 --> 04:38.409
God, it is so good
to see you, honey.

04:38.444 --> 04:39.968
I've missed you very much.

04:40.046 --> 04:41.513
Me, too.

04:41.547 --> 04:43.447
What did you think
of my letter?

04:43.483 --> 04:45.576
That depends.

04:45.618 --> 04:46.949
Did you mean it?

04:46.986 --> 04:48.453
Which part?

04:48.488 --> 04:50.956
The part about
staying here in L.A.

04:50.990 --> 04:53.083
Yes, I did. I...

04:53.126 --> 04:55.287
It's about time we got
to know each other again.

04:55.328 --> 04:58.195
So... what do you say?

04:58.231 --> 05:00.893
I say, welcome back, Dad.

05:00.933 --> 05:03.424
It's good to be home, honey.

05:08.341 --> 05:10.741
Donna...

05:10.777 --> 05:13.371
Joe, what happened?

05:13.413 --> 05:15.313
My ankle swelled up
on me last night.

05:15.348 --> 05:17.179
It does this every
once in a while

05:17.216 --> 05:18.308
since I hurt it in high school.

05:19.419 --> 05:20.386
It's nothing.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.479
I just need to ice it
for a few hours.

05:22.522 --> 05:23.511
Are you sure you're okay?

05:23.556 --> 05:24.921
Yeah, if the swelling

05:24.957 --> 05:26.083
doesn't go down by tomorrow,

05:26.125 --> 05:27.956
I'll go get it checked out
by the team doctor.

05:28.027 --> 05:31.724
Don't worry.

05:31.764 --> 05:32.958
Thanks.

05:33.066 --> 05:36.229
Ah, greetings, "B" movie
aficionados.

05:36.269 --> 05:38.328
Steve, you look way too happy.

05:38.371 --> 05:41.932
Well, I got a call from
Roger Corman himself.

05:41.974 --> 05:44.442
He's sending over one more
special film for me to see.

05:44.477 --> 05:46.775
How'd you guys like to screen
it with me tonight?

05:46.813 --> 05:47.802
Count me in.

05:47.847 --> 05:48.871
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

05:48.915 --> 05:50.075
What do you say, Keats?

05:50.116 --> 05:51.606
You know what they say,

05:51.651 --> 05:53.983
nothing like a little mayhem
and murder on a double date.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.884
And don't forget the cheesy sex.

05:55.922 --> 05:57.787
Is that cheesy sex
or sex with cheese?

05:57.824 --> 06:00.224
Oh... oh!

06:00.259 --> 06:02.159
- Well, how about both?
- Aw!

06:02.195 --> 06:04.095
Be right back.

06:09.569 --> 06:11.264
- Kel.
- Hi.

06:11.304 --> 06:12.396
Hi.

06:12.438 --> 06:14.065
Oh, Lord.

06:14.107 --> 06:16.837
I completely forgot
this was in my purse.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.935
What are you doing with that?

06:19.011 --> 06:21.809
It's evidence.

06:21.848 --> 06:24.078
Valerie gave it to me.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.813
Although I haven't gotten around
to confronting the guilty party.

06:26.853 --> 06:27.877
Colin?

06:27.920 --> 06:29.148
Yeah.

06:29.188 --> 06:32.453
Well, do yourself a favor

06:32.492 --> 06:34.460
and don't walk around
with it in your purse.

06:34.494 --> 06:37.725
Unless you want to find yourself
accidentally in jail.

06:37.764 --> 06:40.858
Good idea.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.733
So, I heard your dad's
coming into town, huh?

06:43.770 --> 06:45.260
Yeah, yeah, he flew in
this morning.

06:45.304 --> 06:46.737
We're going to get
together tonight.

06:46.773 --> 06:48.570
Is that good or bad?

06:48.608 --> 06:51.736
I don't know.

06:51.778 --> 06:54.338
I could be on
a disaster course,

06:54.380 --> 06:56.405
or I could be getting
back the parent

06:56.449 --> 06:57.939
I've been missing
all these years.

06:57.984 --> 07:00.885
Well, let's hope for the latter.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.480
Yeah.

07:05.892 --> 07:08.759
You all did a great job today.

07:08.795 --> 07:11.320
Especially for beginners.

07:11.364 --> 07:13.264
You know, just like when
we were little kids,

07:13.299 --> 07:15.824
we'd pick up a crayon
almost every day.

07:15.868 --> 07:17.358
Remember that? Hmm?

07:17.403 --> 07:19.496
Well, in this class
we're going to recapture

07:19.539 --> 07:21.564
that natural instinct
we all have for art.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.501
All right, that's it.

07:24.544 --> 07:25.704
We'll see you next time.

07:29.816 --> 07:31.943
This class is more
popular than I thought.

07:31.984 --> 07:33.383
I got the last spot in it.

07:33.419 --> 07:35.182
I can't believe so
many people signed up.

07:35.221 --> 07:36.483
Must make you feel good.

07:36.522 --> 07:37.887
Yeah, it does.

07:37.924 --> 07:39.186
How are you feeling
these days?

07:39.225 --> 07:40.453
Great, great.

07:40.493 --> 07:42.222
I've been working out at the gym
every day,

07:42.261 --> 07:43.558
painting every night.
It's been great.

07:43.596 --> 07:45.188
New Year's resolutions?

07:45.231 --> 07:47.324
Yeah, something like that.

07:47.366 --> 07:49.425
Well, I'm glad you're
cleaning your act up.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.834
I was worried about you.

07:50.870 --> 07:54.738
I know, I know.
I appreciate it.

07:54.774 --> 07:56.901
But believe me, I've got
everything under control.

07:56.943 --> 07:59.138
Even Kelly?

07:59.178 --> 08:01.669
That may take a little longer.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.090
Still hurt?

08:17.129 --> 08:19.529
At this point, you could
take a sledgehammer to my ankle

08:19.565 --> 08:21.795
and I wouldn't feel it.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.893
I think the ice
can come off now.

08:27.306 --> 08:30.139
No, no, sit. Whatever
you need, I'll get it.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.939
I have to use the bathroom.

08:32.044 --> 08:34.034
That you're gonna have
to do by yourself.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.410
Right.

08:38.451 --> 08:40.179
Ow! Damn!

08:42.355 --> 08:45.381
I think I better go see
that doctor tomorrow.

08:45.424 --> 08:47.051
Yeah, good idea.

08:52.465 --> 08:54.399
Okay, here we go.

08:54.433 --> 08:58.392
A bona fide selection from
Roger Corman's own video vault.

09:01.140 --> 09:03.904
It's called Unholy Rollers.

09:03.976 --> 09:06.774
Oh, man, tell me this isn't
about a sex-starved minister.

09:06.812 --> 09:10.407
Or about a sex-crazed guy
who invented the wheel.

09:10.449 --> 09:13.179
Guys, Corman films are much
more complex than that.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.618
Mm-hmm.

09:14.654 --> 09:18.249
This one's about a
sex-crazed girl who joins

09:18.291 --> 09:19.781
the ruthless world
of roller derby.

09:19.825 --> 09:21.087
See?

09:21.127 --> 09:22.560
Definitely complex.

09:22.595 --> 09:24.119
Here we go.

09:24.163 --> 09:27.599
Unholy Rollers starring, Claudia
Jennings.

09:27.633 --> 09:29.294
Great actress.
Died very young.

09:29.335 --> 09:34.534
Louis Quinn, Betty Anne Rees,
Roberta Collins, Nat Benson...

09:34.574 --> 09:35.700
Nat Benson?

09:35.741 --> 09:37.572
That name sounds familiar.

09:37.610 --> 09:39.635
Yeah, I think he was
Mr. America, 1972.

09:39.679 --> 09:41.806
Seldom right
and wrong again, Steve.

09:41.847 --> 09:44.475
I do believe that that
was Nat's stage name.

09:44.517 --> 09:46.246
Our Nat?

09:46.285 --> 09:47.252
- Yeah.
- No, no.

09:47.286 --> 09:48.253
Fast forward.

09:48.287 --> 09:50.653
No way, he was in this film.

09:50.690 --> 09:52.715
He could've been; he was an
actor in the early '70s.

09:52.758 --> 09:55.556
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, press play.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.063
Oh, my God.

10:01.334 --> 10:02.596
It's him!

10:02.635 --> 10:03.932
I don't believe it.

10:03.970 --> 10:05.437
This is great, this is great!

10:05.471 --> 10:07.302
Not only do I have
Roger Corman coming,

10:07.340 --> 10:10.400
but I got Nat Benson...
a bona fide cult film star.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.876
Who didn't mention
a word of this

10:11.911 --> 10:14.209
while you were hanging posters
all week in the Peach Pit.

10:14.246 --> 10:16.214
Yeah. Curious, huh?

10:16.248 --> 10:18.182
Maybe he's shy.

10:18.217 --> 10:19.309
Nat? Shy?

10:19.352 --> 10:21.183
Maybe he's, like, trying
to hide something.

10:21.220 --> 10:22.778
Yeah. Like his performance.

10:24.090 --> 10:26.058
Nice shirt.

10:32.231 --> 10:33.960
Hey, honey,
you're a good driver.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.627
Thank you.

10:35.668 --> 10:37.761
I remember trying
to teach your mother

10:37.803 --> 10:39.327
how to drive a stick shift.

10:39.372 --> 10:42.000
Biggest mistake I ever made...
we fought the whole time.

10:42.074 --> 10:44.372
You guys fought all the time.

10:44.410 --> 10:45.968
No, actually, we didn't.

10:46.012 --> 10:48.606
Only, uh, 23 hours a day.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.583
It must have been hard on you

10:51.617 --> 10:53.778
living with her when
she was doing drugs.

10:53.819 --> 10:56.652
Your mother wasn't using
anything I didn't use.

10:56.689 --> 10:59.715
In those days,
we all got drunk or high

10:59.759 --> 11:02.455
on whatever was around,
whenever we could.

11:02.495 --> 11:06.829
It's sex, drugs
and rock and roll!

11:06.866 --> 11:09.596
Boy, were we stupid.

11:11.570 --> 11:13.538
When did you stop?

11:13.572 --> 11:16.439
When I left your mother,
I had no choice.

11:16.475 --> 11:19.706
She wasn't around to pick up
the pieces for me anymore.

11:19.745 --> 11:24.478
Well, the day you left, she
went on a 15-year bender.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.984
Yeah, I know.

11:26.018 --> 11:28.316
I'm sorry you had
to live through that.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.288
Me, too.

11:30.322 --> 11:33.621
I always thought that you
would come back and rescue me,

11:33.659 --> 11:35.820
but you never did.

11:35.861 --> 11:38.557
There was a reason
for that, Kel.

11:38.597 --> 11:39.825
What?

11:39.865 --> 11:41.560
I always thought that if I came

11:41.600 --> 11:43.295
and took you away
from your mother,

11:43.335 --> 11:45.530
that that would have
been the end of her.

11:47.573 --> 11:49.632
You're probably right.

11:49.675 --> 11:51.302
You know...

11:51.343 --> 11:52.708
I wouldn't mind seeing Jackie.

11:52.745 --> 11:55.213
You think she'd put up
with us for dinner

11:55.247 --> 11:57.215
one of these nights, huh?

11:57.249 --> 11:59.376
I think I could arrange that.

11:59.418 --> 12:00.783
Oh, good!

12:00.820 --> 12:03.084
Good girl.

12:06.992 --> 12:10.120
So, what's Colin got lined up
for tomorrow, finger painting?

12:10.162 --> 12:12.460
He's just trying
to unlock our innocent,

12:12.498 --> 12:14.796
- creative instincts.
- Uh-huh.

12:14.834 --> 12:17.632
So, how's his
not-so-innocent nose problem?

12:17.670 --> 12:19.934
He says he's been clean
since New Year's.

12:19.972 --> 12:22.236
Yeah, well, let's hope he's
on the level for Kelly's sake.

12:22.274 --> 12:24.868
Kelly can take care of herself.

12:24.910 --> 12:27.071
I'm not so sure about that.

12:27.113 --> 12:29.138
She's made some
pretty dubious choices

12:29.181 --> 12:30.773
in the boyfriend department.

12:30.816 --> 12:32.477
Well, she got pretty serious
about Brandon.

12:32.518 --> 12:34.179
I hardly call him
a dubious choice.

12:34.220 --> 12:36.381
That's true,
but she also dumped him.

12:36.422 --> 12:37.684
Good point.

12:37.723 --> 12:39.987
I hear her father's in town.
What's he like?

12:40.025 --> 12:41.322
I don't really know.

12:41.360 --> 12:43.453
I wasn't friends with Kelly
growing up.

12:43.496 --> 12:46.431
I shook his hand once,
at the high school graduation,

12:46.465 --> 12:49.525
but, uh, he hasn't made
any appearances since then.

12:49.568 --> 12:52.093
It's no wonder she goes
for the unreliable type...

12:52.138 --> 12:53.628
it's what she's used to.

12:53.672 --> 12:56.140
Thank you, Dr. Malone.

12:58.010 --> 12:59.807
What do you think?

12:59.845 --> 13:02.575
Let's just be thankful
you have other talents.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.081
What?

13:09.989 --> 13:12.480
Here we are.

13:12.525 --> 13:14.857
Home sweet home.

13:14.894 --> 13:17.886
Ah, very nice!

13:17.930 --> 13:19.830
Hey, Kel.
Hi, Mr. Taylor.

13:19.865 --> 13:21.492
- Hi.
- Ah, Donna,

13:21.534 --> 13:23.331
it's so good
to see you again.

13:23.369 --> 13:25.428
Yeah, you, too.
Can I make you some coffee?

13:25.471 --> 13:28.531
No, no, actually, I'd love
some tea, if you have any.

13:28.574 --> 13:29.905
Yeah, sure, no problem.

13:29.942 --> 13:31.967
Uh, Kel, Colin's been
calling you and calling you.

13:32.044 --> 13:33.443
Okay, thanks.

13:33.479 --> 13:34.673
Want to sit down?

13:34.713 --> 13:35.702
Yeah, yeah.

13:35.748 --> 13:37.773
Uh... Colin?

13:37.817 --> 13:40.183
That's a name
I haven't heard.

13:40.219 --> 13:42.449
Let's keep it that way.

13:43.856 --> 13:46.347
Come on, now, what did this
guy do to deserve that?

13:46.392 --> 13:48.553
I don't really want
to get into it.

13:48.594 --> 13:50.459
Oh, come on, Kel,
I'm your father.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.260
Okay.

13:53.299 --> 13:55.927
He broke a promise
too many times.

13:55.968 --> 13:57.731
Ah. But you're
in love with him?

13:58.938 --> 13:59.996
Yeah.

14:00.039 --> 14:01.802
That's the problem.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.706
That's always the
problem, honey.

14:03.742 --> 14:05.903
Being in love with
someone who hurts you.

14:06.946 --> 14:08.846
Well, actually...

14:08.881 --> 14:10.849
he's hurting himself.

14:12.318 --> 14:14.718
He loves his cocaine
more than he loves me.

14:14.753 --> 14:17.347
I doubt that, but it's a very,

14:17.389 --> 14:20.290
uh, seductive mistress,
I can attest to that.

14:20.326 --> 14:23.784
I just don't want to deal
with it, you know?

14:23.829 --> 14:25.387
Mm.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.533
You know, honey,
I always think

14:28.567 --> 14:31.536
that people deserve
a second chance.

14:31.570 --> 14:34.698
Of course a guy like me
has to think like that,

14:34.740 --> 14:36.298
because I'm always
asking for one.

14:37.509 --> 14:40.444
Well, I am ready to give you
a second chance...

14:40.479 --> 14:42.845
and a third chance
and a fourth chance,

14:42.882 --> 14:44.372
a fifth chance...

14:46.385 --> 14:48.353
I'm glad you're here, Dad.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.412
Yeah, me, too.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.338
Condor. Keats's office.

15:07.373 --> 15:08.465
Yeah, is Susan there?

15:08.507 --> 15:10.498
No, she's not.
Can I take a message?

15:10.542 --> 15:12.476
- Who's this?
- Brandon Walsh.

15:12.511 --> 15:14.877
Walsh, it's, uh, Casten.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.779
Isn't this auspicious.

15:16.815 --> 15:18.578
I don't know, Jonathan, is it?

15:18.617 --> 15:19.948
So, how's Susan?

15:20.052 --> 15:21.849
You taking good care of her?

15:21.887 --> 15:23.616
Susan can take care of herself.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.146
Oh, that's for sure.

15:25.190 --> 15:28.216
Listen, do me a favor, um,
tell Susan I'm gonna be in L.A.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.888
a week from Friday, and I
would really like to see her.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.296
You bet, I'll be sure
to pass that along.

15:33.332 --> 15:34.697
I'll bet you will.

15:34.733 --> 15:36.098
I'll see you soon.

15:36.135 --> 15:38.467
Uh-huh. Have a nice day.

15:38.504 --> 15:40.995
Oh, man.

15:45.044 --> 15:46.978
Hi. What'd I miss?

15:47.046 --> 15:48.877
Nothing.

16:01.360 --> 16:03.624
Picture this...
Roger Corman comes in,

16:03.662 --> 16:07.120
gives a little intro
on the making of Unholy Rollers.

16:07.166 --> 16:10.067
He talks about the actors,
where they are now.

16:10.102 --> 16:12.127
Bang! You pop out on stage.

16:12.171 --> 16:14.571
Direct from
our very own Peach Pit...

16:14.606 --> 16:15.868
Sorry, no go.

16:17.209 --> 16:18.836
Talk to him, Clare.

16:18.877 --> 16:21.277
All right, Nat, think about it.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.781
It's gonna be a full house
at the club tonight.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.943
Who knows, you might even jump-
start the old acting career.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.351
Plus, I was on the
radio this morning.

16:28.387 --> 16:30.287
I billed you as
our special guest.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.187
Don't make a liar out of me.

16:32.224 --> 16:36.058
I'm flattered and I'm touched,
but I won't do it.

16:36.095 --> 16:37.289
Be reasonable.

16:37.329 --> 16:38.921
I am being reasonable.

16:38.964 --> 16:41.091
I left acting behind
a long time ago,

16:41.133 --> 16:43.693
and I have no desire
to reenter that world.

16:43.736 --> 16:45.897
End of story.

16:50.275 --> 16:51.799
So, um...

16:51.844 --> 16:54.244
what are you gonna do now?

16:54.279 --> 16:56.543
I'm gonna wear him down.

17:00.185 --> 17:01.914
- Hey, Kel.
- Hey.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.922
- How's your dad?
- Good. He's, uh, moving here.

17:04.990 --> 17:06.617
What? After
all these years?

17:06.657 --> 17:08.683
I know. He says he's
come full circle.

17:08.727 --> 17:10.490
He's tired of
life on the road.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.792
Well, I'd like to say
I'm happy for you,

17:12.830 --> 17:15.356
but after what my father's
told me about him, uh,

17:15.401 --> 17:17.164
I'd be careful if I were you.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.170
Well, tell Mel
to get used to him,

17:19.204 --> 17:21.262
because we are going
house-hunting today.

17:21.306 --> 17:22.796
Hey, guys. You want anything?

17:22.840 --> 17:23.933
No. No, thanks.

17:23.976 --> 17:25.272
I got to go.

17:27.846 --> 17:30.576
Well, I guess it was too much
for Kelly to join us.

17:30.616 --> 17:32.311
Aw, come on,

17:32.351 --> 17:34.683
she's meeting her father today...
give her a break.

17:34.720 --> 17:38.383
Why should I give her a break?
She never gives me one.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.461
Don't worry about
the ankle, Joe.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.127
We did an MRl... it's fine.

17:50.169 --> 17:52.467
Just take it easy
for a couple of days.

17:52.504 --> 17:54.131
Like, don't walk, you mean?

17:54.173 --> 17:56.539
No. Like, don't run
the stadium steps.

17:56.575 --> 17:57.974
Now swing around.

17:58.010 --> 18:01.002
Long as you're here, let me
check everything else out.

18:02.181 --> 18:03.341
So, how's life, Joe?

18:03.382 --> 18:04.679
You got a girlfriend?

18:04.716 --> 18:06.343
Yeah, couple
of months, actually.

18:06.385 --> 18:07.477
Oh, great, great.

18:09.488 --> 18:11.979
Now, take a deep breath.

18:16.528 --> 18:18.519
Breathe again.

18:23.335 --> 18:25.030
Listen, Joe,

18:25.070 --> 18:26.560
you had a cold lately?

18:26.605 --> 18:27.902
No.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.500
Well, it's probably nothing.

18:30.542 --> 18:33.375
I just want you
to do me a favor.

18:33.412 --> 18:35.642
I want you to see
a cardiologist.

18:35.681 --> 18:37.444
Dr. Levin's a
topnotch heart man

18:37.483 --> 18:38.609
right here on campus.

18:38.650 --> 18:40.675
Unless you have someone
else you prefer.

18:40.719 --> 18:42.949
My girlfriend's father's
a cardiologist.

18:43.021 --> 18:44.545
Uh, Dr. John Martin?

18:44.590 --> 18:46.080
He's terrific.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.821
Just get it checked out.

18:50.529 --> 18:53.157
Is there something
I should be worried about?

18:53.198 --> 18:56.065
No. Just humor me
and take care of it.

18:57.703 --> 18:58.829
All right, Doc.

18:58.871 --> 19:00.736
But if there's
anything wrong with me,

19:00.772 --> 19:02.296
you lose your season tickets.

19:05.477 --> 19:07.104
Oh, it's very nice.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.011
Well, it's got it all.

19:09.047 --> 19:10.844
Original peg-and-
groove floors,

19:10.883 --> 19:13.716
that Malibu tile
in the fireplace,

19:13.752 --> 19:15.276
and a gourmet kitchen

19:15.320 --> 19:19.188
with a six-burner restaurant
stove and a griddle? Ha!

19:19.224 --> 19:21.192
Oh, for all those mornings
I'll make you hotcakes.

19:21.226 --> 19:22.853
You don't even know
how to make toast.

19:22.895 --> 19:25.796
I'll learn, I'll learn.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.799
So, um...

19:27.833 --> 19:29.698
what do you think?

19:29.735 --> 19:30.929
Well, I am sold,

19:31.003 --> 19:33.597
but he is the one
you have to convince.

19:33.639 --> 19:35.163
Say the word,

19:35.207 --> 19:37.835
I'll have that lease
drawn up by tomorrow.

19:37.876 --> 19:41.903
Well, Candace, since, uh,
you put it that way...

19:41.947 --> 19:43.380
sign me up.

19:43.415 --> 19:44.939
All right!

19:51.356 --> 19:55.156
Hey, Val, can I ask you
for some advice?

19:55.194 --> 19:57.162
I'd be honored.

19:57.196 --> 20:00.757
Actually, I was hoping to tap
into your more devious side.

20:00.799 --> 20:04.895
Well, in that case, I'm not
honored, but ask anyway.

20:04.937 --> 20:08.236
Okay. I was in Susan's office,
I answered the phone,

20:08.273 --> 20:10.241
and it was that Jonathan guy.

20:10.275 --> 20:11.674
You should've hung up on him.

20:11.710 --> 20:12.938
You're right, I should have.

20:12.978 --> 20:14.570
But I didn't...
I took a message.

20:14.613 --> 20:16.444
But then I didn't
give it to Susan.

20:16.481 --> 20:18.676
And I'm gathering
it was a message

20:18.717 --> 20:20.275
- you didn't want her to get.
- You could say that.

20:20.319 --> 20:22.412
All right, well,
this is a no-brainer.

20:22.454 --> 20:24.319
You go in tomorrow morning,
you write the message down

20:24.356 --> 20:25.846
on those little "while
you were out" pads,

20:25.891 --> 20:27.552
and throw it on the
mess on her desk,

20:27.593 --> 20:28.582
and eventually
she'll find it.

20:28.627 --> 20:30.492
That'll work.

20:30.529 --> 20:31.962
Glad I could help.

20:35.367 --> 20:38.461
Well, Kelly, I've
enjoyed dinner, but, uh,

20:38.503 --> 20:39.800
how about this Colin?

20:39.838 --> 20:41.772
I'll give him the once-over,
and maybe

20:41.807 --> 20:44.640
you'll do the right thing and
give him a second chance, huh?

20:46.678 --> 20:48.373
We are in his neighborhood.

20:48.413 --> 20:49.471
Oh, we are.

20:49.514 --> 20:52.074
Well, what are we waiting for?

21:22.180 --> 21:23.147
Hi.

21:23.181 --> 21:24.170
Kelly!

21:24.216 --> 21:26.377
I want you to meet my father.

21:28.920 --> 21:31.616
Colin Robbins.
Welcome.

21:31.657 --> 21:32.851
Oh, thanks.

21:32.891 --> 21:34.791
Are-are we catching you
at a bad time?

21:34.826 --> 21:36.851
No, no. Actually,
I can use the break.

21:36.895 --> 21:39.455
Ah. Uh, great loft.

21:39.498 --> 21:40.897
Thanks, thanks.

21:40.932 --> 21:42.763
You know, it's really
a pleasure to meet you.

21:42.801 --> 21:43.995
I've heard so much
about you.

21:44.036 --> 21:45.594
Same here.
I'd, I'd really like

21:45.637 --> 21:47.332
to take a look at your work.

21:47.372 --> 21:48.600
Feel free.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.631
Thanks. Excuse me.

21:51.343 --> 21:53.106
Thank you for coming.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.636
Thank you for bringing
your father.

21:55.681 --> 21:57.239
I've missed you so much.

21:57.282 --> 21:59.011
Thank you for being high.

21:59.051 --> 22:00.382
Come on, Kelly.

22:00.419 --> 22:02.284
I can see it in
your eyes, Colin.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.346
The holidays are over,
and so are we.

22:04.389 --> 22:05.356
Dad, let's go.

22:05.390 --> 22:06.482
What's the big rush, honey?

22:06.525 --> 22:09.221
Colin's got to get back
to his work.

22:09.261 --> 22:10.319
Oh,

22:10.362 --> 22:14.162
I like your style, Colin.

22:14.199 --> 22:15.860
I try.

22:15.901 --> 22:17.698
Trying doesn't cut it.

22:17.736 --> 22:18.964
Ready?

22:19.071 --> 22:20.971
Mm-hmm.
Nice to meet you.

22:21.039 --> 22:22.028
You, too.

22:33.385 --> 22:34.545
Damn it!

22:59.945 --> 23:03.381
No, it's been busy as usual.

23:03.415 --> 23:05.076
Where are you?

23:06.918 --> 23:08.545
I'm in Atlanta. Yeah.

23:08.587 --> 23:10.885
I'm here
for the World Nudist Convention.

23:10.922 --> 23:11.911
I bet you are.

23:11.957 --> 23:14.425
Actually, I'm meeting Elton John
for lunch.

23:14.459 --> 23:15.619
You are not!

23:15.660 --> 23:17.355
Yeah, really. I am.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.193
He has an apartment here.
He's gonna give me a tour.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.893
And how'd you do that?

23:21.933 --> 23:23.560
Ah, it must be
my inimitable charm.

23:23.602 --> 23:24.899
So did you get my message?

23:24.936 --> 23:26.403
No, what message?

23:26.438 --> 23:27.837
Oh, that figures.

23:27.873 --> 23:29.170
What figures?

23:29.207 --> 23:30.970
Ask Walsh.
I called yesterday.

23:31.042 --> 23:31.974
He didn't tell you?

23:32.043 --> 23:35.774
Uh, no, he didn't.

23:35.814 --> 23:37.975
All right. Well, I'm gonna be in
a week from Friday,

23:38.083 --> 23:39.675
so tell Walsh you're busy
next weekend, okay?

23:39.718 --> 23:41.686
I am busy... with him.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.483
Yeah, we'll see about that.

23:43.522 --> 23:44.921
Love you. Bye.

23:47.325 --> 23:49.589
Walsh, get in here!

23:52.130 --> 23:55.293
What?

23:55.333 --> 23:57.631
Why didn't you tell me
Jonathan called yesterday?

23:57.669 --> 23:58.693
I did tell you.

23:58.737 --> 24:00.898
No, you didn't.

24:00.939 --> 24:03.203
Sure, I did. I left a note
right on your desk.

24:03.241 --> 24:06.039
Although, how you can find
anything in that mess...

24:06.077 --> 24:07.806
Where?

24:07.846 --> 24:11.077
Uh, how about

24:11.116 --> 24:13.016
right under your nose?

24:16.087 --> 24:18.715
Sorry.

24:18.757 --> 24:21.920
So are you going to see him
while he's here?

24:21.960 --> 24:25.521
I don't know. I'll leave
a message on your desk.

24:27.299 --> 24:28.732
Brandon, wait.

24:28.767 --> 24:30.359
I'm...

24:30.402 --> 24:35.499
I'm sorry. It's just you
and Jonathan.

24:35.540 --> 24:37.838
I thought maybe you,
you forgot it on purpose.

24:37.876 --> 24:39.241
It's all right.

24:39.277 --> 24:41.245
No apology necessary.

24:53.458 --> 24:54.447
Hey.

24:54.493 --> 24:55.983
Hey.

24:56.094 --> 24:57.994
So, what'd the doctor say?

24:58.029 --> 24:59.223
Well, you were right.

24:59.264 --> 25:00.856
I just need
to stay off it.

25:00.899 --> 25:02.389
I told you.

25:02.434 --> 25:06.131
Listen, what kind of doctor
is your dad again?

25:06.171 --> 25:07.433
Cardiologist. Why?

25:07.472 --> 25:09.872
It's Coach Lynch.
He's having some chest pain.

25:09.908 --> 25:11.273
He needs
to see a specialist.

25:11.309 --> 25:12.936
I was wondering
if your father would see him.

25:13.044 --> 25:13.942
Yeah, sure.

25:14.045 --> 25:16.343
Just have the coach
call the office,

25:16.381 --> 25:17.939
and my dad will fit
him in whenever.

25:17.983 --> 25:19.974
Great.
Cool.

25:24.189 --> 25:27.317
Hey, Nat, can I get a pot of
coffee for my slaves next door?

25:27.359 --> 25:28.417
They're working
really hard

25:28.460 --> 25:29.950
to get this festival
off the ground.

25:30.061 --> 25:31.153
Ask Willie.

25:32.864 --> 25:34.889
You know, I know you said you
wouldn't come tonight,

25:34.933 --> 25:36.400
but I really think
you should reconsider.

25:36.434 --> 25:37.958
No.

25:38.003 --> 25:38.970
Why not?

25:39.037 --> 25:40.470
Is it Corman?
Did he stiff you?

25:40.505 --> 25:41.767
That hasn't got anything
to do with it.

25:41.806 --> 25:43.637
Roger Corman's a great guy.

25:43.675 --> 25:45.506
Then what was it?
We saw the film.

25:45.544 --> 25:46.704
You were very funny.

25:46.745 --> 25:48.645
Thank you.

25:48.680 --> 25:49.669
Hmm,

25:49.714 --> 25:50.681
this doesn't make any sense.

25:50.715 --> 25:51.841
What happened?

25:51.883 --> 25:54.943
It's personal, and I don't want
to talk about it, okay?

25:54.986 --> 25:57.079
Was it a woman?

25:57.122 --> 26:01.081
It was a woman!

26:01.126 --> 26:03.117
Okay, which one
of the actresses was it?

26:03.161 --> 26:05.721
One of those roller derbettes,
huh, huh?

26:05.764 --> 26:06.924
She wasn't in the picture.

26:07.032 --> 26:09.227
Well, who is she?

26:09.267 --> 26:10.325
And what happened to her?

26:10.368 --> 26:12.393
Told you,
I don't want to talk about it.

26:15.106 --> 26:16.471
Okay, forget I asked.

26:16.508 --> 26:19.807
Listen, you go have a good time,
tonight.

26:19.844 --> 26:23.678
Send my best to Roger Corman,
okay?

26:28.053 --> 26:30.419
Uh, good evening,
ladies and gentlemen

26:30.455 --> 26:32.946
and welcome to the Roger Corman
Film Festival,

26:33.058 --> 26:35.993
brought to you by your very own
Steve Sanders!

26:40.065 --> 26:42.898
Well, as promised, the maestro
is here himself

26:42.934 --> 26:44.765
to introduce
our first selection.

26:44.803 --> 26:46.498
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
a warm welcome

26:46.538 --> 26:50.133
for the legendary Roger Corman.

26:52.143 --> 26:53.508
Thanks, Steve.

26:53.545 --> 26:55.479
I'm more than flattered

26:55.513 --> 26:57.708
that my work has been chosen
for this event.

26:57.749 --> 27:01.014
The movie tonight
is a personal favorite of mine.

27:01.052 --> 27:02.076
I hope you enjoy it.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.553
Thanks, Roger.

27:04.990 --> 27:07.720
Now let's watch the magic
of these women on wheels

27:07.759 --> 27:09.784
in Roger Corman's
Unholy Rollers.

27:09.828 --> 27:12.023
Oh, yeah!

27:15.100 --> 27:18.160
All right, all right.

27:18.203 --> 27:19.932
Damn Stern,
cheapest guy in the world.

27:20.005 --> 27:24.772
Got me doing 15 jobs
around here on a guard's pay.

27:24.809 --> 27:27.369
Too cheap to give me a helper.

27:27.412 --> 27:31.712
Welcome, roller derby fans
to Stern Stadium.

27:31.750 --> 27:32.808
There's Nat.

27:32.851 --> 27:33.840
Which one?

27:33.885 --> 27:35.182
The one on the left.

27:39.024 --> 27:41.288
Oh, he's so cute.

27:43.995 --> 27:47.726
I get a trophy every time
I put someone in the hospital?

27:47.766 --> 27:50.132
We had this one made special.

27:50.168 --> 27:51.692
Pardon me.

27:51.736 --> 27:54.330
Wasn't Nat Benson supposed
to be here tonight?

27:54.372 --> 27:55.703
I heard something
on the radio.

27:55.740 --> 27:57.605
Yes, he was. Unfortunately,
it didn't work out.

27:57.642 --> 27:59.610
Oh, I was hoping
I'd see him.

27:59.644 --> 28:01.544
Do you know Nat Benson?

28:01.579 --> 28:03.342
I did a long time ago.

28:03.381 --> 28:04.348
You don't say?

28:04.382 --> 28:06.282
How long has it been
since you've seen him?

28:06.317 --> 28:08.911
Has to be about 25 years.

28:09.020 --> 28:10.715
In fact, the last time
I saw him

28:10.755 --> 28:12.723
was when he was making
this picture.

28:12.757 --> 28:15.885
Really? And how do
you know him?

28:15.927 --> 28:19.590
Well, to tell you the truth,
we were engaged.

28:19.631 --> 28:22.566
Engaged to be married engaged?

28:22.600 --> 28:24.192
- To Nat?
- You know Nat?

28:24.235 --> 28:26.760
Do I know Nat?
What's your name?

28:26.805 --> 28:29.035
Joan. Joan Diamond.

28:29.074 --> 28:31.304
It's nice to meet you, Joan.

28:31.342 --> 28:32.309
Come with me.

28:32.343 --> 28:34.072
Let's take a little walk.

28:40.452 --> 28:41.680
Nat,

28:41.720 --> 28:43.950
there's someone
here to see you.

28:44.055 --> 28:45.352
Nat?

28:46.825 --> 28:48.190
Joanie?

28:49.227 --> 28:51.457
What are you doing here?

28:51.496 --> 28:53.464
Looking for you.

28:55.366 --> 28:56.424
Oh, my!

28:56.468 --> 28:58.959
Oh, God,

28:59.070 --> 29:00.230
I can't believe it.

29:00.271 --> 29:01.397
You haven't changed at all.

29:01.439 --> 29:03.430
Oh, yeah, I have, a lot.

29:03.475 --> 29:05.670
It's been such a long time.

29:05.710 --> 29:07.371
I've been married and divorced.

29:07.412 --> 29:08.379
I've got three kids.

29:08.413 --> 29:10.108
And I'm a grandmother now, Nat.

29:10.148 --> 29:12.013
That can't be possible.

29:12.050 --> 29:14.450
A lot can happen in 25 years.

29:15.787 --> 29:16.879
Well, it looks like
you took over

29:16.921 --> 29:17.910
for your dad
after all, huh?

29:17.956 --> 29:20.481
Yeah, I...

29:20.525 --> 29:24.359
Steve, aren't you busy
next door?

29:24.395 --> 29:25.487
Yeah.

29:29.734 --> 29:32.703
Yeah, I, uh, I didn't have much
choice.

29:32.737 --> 29:35.501
When he got sick, I had to just
step up to the plate.

29:35.540 --> 29:39.135
Well, sometimes life makes
our choices for us.

29:40.645 --> 29:43.239
Still, you were a good actor.
Very good.

29:43.281 --> 29:46.546
Yeah, I came close

29:46.584 --> 29:47.846
a couple of times.

29:47.886 --> 29:49.945
I had two great parts.

29:50.054 --> 29:54.252
A lucky break, I wouldn't be
slinging hash for a career.

29:54.292 --> 29:56.453
Well, running a successful
business seems

29:56.494 --> 29:58.621
like a pretty good career move
to me.

29:58.663 --> 30:00.563
You think so?

30:00.598 --> 30:02.065
Yeah, I do.

30:02.100 --> 30:04.330
It's kind of nice
to hear you say that.

30:07.305 --> 30:09.273
I never thought
I'd see you again.

30:09.307 --> 30:11.798
Here you are.

30:11.843 --> 30:14.539
You know,
I've never forgotten you.

30:14.579 --> 30:17.605
I can't say that there wasn't
a part of me that always hoped

30:17.649 --> 30:19.139
that I'd look over that counter

30:19.184 --> 30:20.845
and see you walk
through that door.

30:23.555 --> 30:25.216
Well, here I am.

30:25.256 --> 30:27.520
Here we are.

30:27.559 --> 30:29.220
So, let's sit down.
Fill me in.

30:29.260 --> 30:30.659
And tell me everything,
would you?

30:30.695 --> 30:31.923
That could take all night.

30:31.963 --> 30:33.260
You got other plans?

30:33.298 --> 30:36.358
I was going to watch
that movie next door.

30:36.401 --> 30:37.732
Oh, hell, I know the ending.

30:37.769 --> 30:40.033
Come on. I want
to show you around and talk.

30:44.976 --> 30:47.342
Well, thank you very much.

30:47.378 --> 30:49.869
I'm really glad
you could join us.

30:49.914 --> 30:51.575
Shall I order
a bottle of wine?

30:51.616 --> 30:53.675
No, not for me, thanks,
but you go ahead.

30:53.718 --> 30:55.015
How long's it been
now, Jackie?

30:55.053 --> 30:56.782
I've been sober
for five years now.

30:56.821 --> 30:58.812
Well, I guess

30:58.857 --> 31:01.382
we all have to pull ourselves
out of the fast lane eventually.

31:01.426 --> 31:03.587
Is that why you're moving back
to L.A.?

31:03.628 --> 31:08.327
Well, I, after 35 years, I think
it's time to settle down.

31:08.366 --> 31:10.129
Better late than never.

31:11.202 --> 31:12.294
So where's this new house?

31:12.337 --> 31:13.895
Beverly Glen.
Our old neighborhood.

31:13.938 --> 31:15.064
Really?

31:15.106 --> 31:17.597
That's where you spent
the first years of your life.

31:17.642 --> 31:20.202
I know.
Not that I remember any of it.

31:20.245 --> 31:22.338
We had this precious
little house in the canyon.

31:22.380 --> 31:25.440
Which got hit by mudslides
every year without fail.

31:25.483 --> 31:28.247
I don't remember any of that.

31:28.286 --> 31:29.981
I'm amazed we do.

31:30.088 --> 31:31.919
It's just as well
you don't remember, honey.

31:31.956 --> 31:34.823
The high times on the Glen were
a little too high,

31:34.859 --> 31:36.793
as I recall.

31:36.828 --> 31:39.456
So how old is
the baby now?

31:39.497 --> 31:40.896
She's not a baby anymore.

31:40.932 --> 31:42.126
She's four years old.

31:42.166 --> 31:43.133
And you and Mel?

31:43.167 --> 31:44.134
Just fine

31:44.168 --> 31:46.534
living together.
Very happily unmarried.

31:46.571 --> 31:50.439
I'm glad you were able to turn
your life around, Jackie.

31:50.475 --> 31:53.103
It's great seeing
you doing so well.

31:53.144 --> 31:56.375
You know, I have to admit, Bill,
that when Kelly told me

31:56.414 --> 31:59.906
you were coming back to town,
I warned her about you.

31:59.951 --> 32:03.512
Well, I guess I deserve that.

32:03.554 --> 32:05.647
To my parents.

32:05.690 --> 32:08.056
To our daughter.

32:08.092 --> 32:12.051
Who hopefully will not make
the same mistakes we did.

32:12.096 --> 32:13.961
Amen.

32:19.404 --> 32:20.735
What are you doing here?

32:20.772 --> 32:22.763
For all the money I spent
on your education,

32:22.807 --> 32:25.469
I find you in these lousy
locker rooms!

32:25.510 --> 32:27.705
Val, can I talk
to you for a minute?

32:27.745 --> 32:30.373
I'm a little busy.

32:30.415 --> 32:33.316
This'll just take a minute.
Upstairs?

32:33.351 --> 32:34.978
I'll be right back.

32:35.086 --> 32:37.077
Yeah.

32:37.121 --> 32:40.488
Okay, I'm sorry. But you think
that the next time

32:40.525 --> 32:43.460
you come barging in here
you could knock first?

32:44.862 --> 32:47.422
Okay, what's so important
that it couldn't wait,

32:47.465 --> 32:50.127
at least till after
the screening?

32:50.168 --> 32:51.499
I want my coke back.

32:51.536 --> 32:53.163
Excuse me?

32:53.204 --> 32:55.536
The blow you took from me on New
Year's. I want it back.

32:55.573 --> 32:57.097
I'm in the middle of
a painting right now.

32:57.141 --> 32:58.301
I really need it
to finish.

32:58.343 --> 33:00.140
Well, drink some coffee
like the rest of us, Colin.

33:00.178 --> 33:01.145
What's wrong with you?

33:01.179 --> 33:02.942
Nothing's wrong with me.

33:03.014 --> 33:05.209
Nothing a few lines
won't take care of.

33:05.249 --> 33:07.911
Well, I don't
have it anymore.

33:07.952 --> 33:09.078
What?

33:09.120 --> 33:10.485
I said, I don't have it anymore.

33:10.521 --> 33:14.150
Please tell me
you threw it away.

33:14.192 --> 33:15.955
No, I didn't throw it away.
I gave it to Kelly.

33:16.060 --> 33:17.152
What do you mean
you gave it to Kelly?

33:17.195 --> 33:18.753
I gave it to Kelly.
She didn't tell you?

33:18.796 --> 33:20.559
No, she didn't tell me!

33:20.598 --> 33:21.963
What are you thinking, Valerie?

33:22.066 --> 33:23.966
I can't believe
you did this.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.299
What can't you believe, Colin?

33:26.537 --> 33:28.164
That I gave your drugs to Kelly,

33:28.206 --> 33:30.071
or you don't have
any more drugs to do?

33:52.363 --> 33:53.955
You should have
heard them, Donna.

33:53.998 --> 33:57.092
I don't think I've ever seen
my parents get along that well.

33:57.135 --> 34:00.104
I couldn't even get a word
in edgewise after a while.

34:00.138 --> 34:02.698
Well, your dad is charming.

34:02.740 --> 34:04.435
I think it's more than that.

34:04.475 --> 34:07.535
This sounds weird to say
about your own dad, but...

34:07.578 --> 34:10.513
I think he finally
grew up.

34:12.382 --> 34:14.851
If that's Colin, tell him
I'm not here, okay?

34:14.886 --> 34:16.820
Okay.

34:16.853 --> 34:18.286
Hello?

34:18.322 --> 34:19.846
Hi, hang on. It's Joe.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.916
Oh, okay.
If my dad calls for me,

34:21.958 --> 34:24.587
tell him I'm on my way
to the Beverly Glen house.

34:24.629 --> 34:27.324
Okay. Hey, you, I thought we had
a study date this morning.

34:27.364 --> 34:28.831
Yeah, I can't make it.

34:28.866 --> 34:30.264
I'll see you on campus later?

34:30.301 --> 34:31.962
Yeah, sure.
Is everything okay?

34:32.070 --> 34:34.971
Yeah, just bad planning
on my part.

34:35.039 --> 34:36.630
I forgot I had an appointment.

34:36.674 --> 34:37.971
Look, I got to run.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.475
Okay.
I'll see you later.

34:39.510 --> 34:41.000
Great. Bye.

34:42.547 --> 34:43.639
Excuse me, Joe.

34:43.681 --> 34:45.978
Dr. Martin's going
to be a little longer.

34:46.016 --> 34:48.143
So I'll get you started
with a chest X-ray, and then

34:48.186 --> 34:49.676
we'll run an echocardiogram,
all right?

34:49.719 --> 34:51.347
Whatever you say.

34:51.389 --> 34:53.118
All right, follow me.

34:59.197 --> 35:00.186
What?

35:00.231 --> 35:02.256
Well, that's a friendly
greeting.

35:04.302 --> 35:05.826
What do you want, Valerie?

35:05.870 --> 35:07.394
Well, I thought I'd alert you
to the fact

35:07.438 --> 35:08.928
that you're supposed to
be teaching a class right now.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.577
I'm taking a personal day.

35:13.611 --> 35:15.772
Oh, is that what you call it?

35:15.813 --> 35:17.405
Sounds to me like
you copped another gram.

35:17.448 --> 35:19.075
I was up all night painting,
all right?

35:19.117 --> 35:21.051
Well, I hope it was worth it.

35:21.085 --> 35:23.178
You know what, it was.

35:23.221 --> 35:24.449
It's fantastic.

35:24.489 --> 35:27.185
Good for you.

35:49.780 --> 35:51.338
Is this a blond thing?

35:51.382 --> 35:53.316
I mean, we did say
11:00, didn't we?

35:53.351 --> 35:55.945
Yeah, yeah, he should
be here any minute.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.784
Well, it's creeping
up on noon,

35:57.822 --> 36:00.154
and I have another
appointment.

36:00.191 --> 36:02.682
My father's usually
very prompt.

36:02.727 --> 36:04.524
Could we just give him
a few more minutes?

36:04.562 --> 36:05.529
I really can't.

36:05.563 --> 36:07.554
Look, if you still
want the house...

36:07.598 --> 36:09.532
Oh, we do.
We definitely do.

36:09.567 --> 36:11.364
- There's no question about that.
- Good.

36:11.402 --> 36:14.030
Then just call me, and we'll
do this again tomorrow.

36:14.071 --> 36:15.333
Great.

36:15.373 --> 36:17.068
Just promise me you won't
give it to anybody else.

36:17.108 --> 36:18.939
I promise I won't.

36:19.010 --> 36:21.274
I'll call you first.

36:21.312 --> 36:22.472
Thanks, Candace.

36:22.513 --> 36:23.775
Bye.
Bye.

36:35.893 --> 36:37.952
Donna, I don't usually
do this kind of thing,

36:38.062 --> 36:42.931
but, um, this morning,
when I called you,

36:42.967 --> 36:44.798
I wasn't exactly
telling the truth.

36:44.835 --> 36:46.735
What do you mean?

36:46.771 --> 36:48.534
Well, it wasn't just
any appointment.

36:48.573 --> 36:50.803
I was at your
father's office.

36:50.841 --> 36:52.206
With the coach?

36:52.243 --> 36:53.835
No.

36:53.878 --> 36:56.108
By myself.

36:59.283 --> 37:01.114
There's something wrong
with my heart.

37:01.152 --> 37:02.915
What?

37:02.987 --> 37:04.079
Why wouldn't you tell me?

37:04.121 --> 37:05.713
Because I didn't
want you to worry.

37:05.756 --> 37:08.850
Well, what's wrong?
What did my dad say?

37:08.893 --> 37:11.487
Well, the team doctor
heard something weird,

37:11.529 --> 37:12.928
and now your father thinks
that I've got

37:12.997 --> 37:15.591
some kind of
a congenital heart thing.

37:15.633 --> 37:18.761
A defect.

37:18.803 --> 37:19.929
Oh, my God.

37:20.037 --> 37:21.527
I just got back from
a meeting with the coach

37:21.572 --> 37:22.766
and the athletic director,

37:22.807 --> 37:24.274
and they want me to get
a second opinion.

37:24.308 --> 37:26.936
Yeah, you should.

37:26.978 --> 37:28.809
I know my dad always
recommends that.

37:28.846 --> 37:31.713
Well, I hate to say this, Donna.

37:31.749 --> 37:33.876
But I'm hoping the next guy
will say your father was wrong.

37:33.918 --> 37:35.852
Yeah, me, too.

37:35.886 --> 37:38.320
I got to get going.

37:38.356 --> 37:39.550
They made an appointment for me

37:39.590 --> 37:40.784
at the health center
this afternoon.

37:40.825 --> 37:42.918
Do you want me
to go with you?

37:42.960 --> 37:45.520
Yeah, that'd be great.

37:57.541 --> 38:00.339
Hi, I'd like to speak
to Bill Taylor.

38:00.378 --> 38:04.212
He's in room 1019.

38:04.248 --> 38:06.443
Excuse me?

38:06.484 --> 38:09.920
He checked out?
When?

38:09.954 --> 38:11.854
I see.

38:11.889 --> 38:13.584
No. No message.

38:31.575 --> 38:32.599
Here you go.

38:32.643 --> 38:33.940
- Ah...
- Thanks.

38:33.978 --> 38:35.536
So, Nat, how does it feel

38:35.579 --> 38:37.740
seeing a woman you love
after 25 years?

38:37.782 --> 38:39.875
Sweet.
Really sweet.

38:39.917 --> 38:42.044
That's it? That's all
you're going to give us?

38:42.086 --> 38:43.917
All right.

38:43.954 --> 38:45.387
I'll give you one more thing.

38:45.423 --> 38:47.550
A great big kiss!

38:48.926 --> 38:50.860
I guess the film
festival was a success.

38:50.895 --> 38:53.193
It kind of changed my life.

38:53.230 --> 38:54.424
Oh, that's great.

38:54.465 --> 38:56.023
No, you two are great.

38:59.603 --> 39:02.333
So I was thinking,
next weekend

39:02.373 --> 39:04.603
maybe we should drive
up to San Luis Obispo.

39:04.642 --> 39:06.234
I love it up there
this time of year.

39:06.277 --> 39:07.244
Next weekend?

39:07.278 --> 39:09.576
Yeah.
Unless you're busy.

39:09.613 --> 39:13.242
No, you mean, unless I have
plans with Jonathan.

39:13.284 --> 39:15.252
Do you have plans
with Jonathan?

39:15.286 --> 39:16.651
No.

39:16.687 --> 39:19.247
Good.

39:19.290 --> 39:21.554
So where is San Luis
Obispo, anyway?

39:21.592 --> 39:22.559
I have no idea.

39:22.593 --> 39:23.958
Me neither.

39:30.067 --> 39:32.900
Well, Joe.

39:32.937 --> 39:34.598
I think we've got
what we need here.

39:34.638 --> 39:36.503
Am I gonna be okay?
Yeah.

39:36.540 --> 39:38.735
I'm glad to say you are.
You're just fine.

39:38.776 --> 39:40.801
What about what Dr. Martin said?

39:40.845 --> 39:43.336
With all due respect,
I have a differing opinion.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.679
It's not uncommon
in our specialty.

39:45.716 --> 39:47.547
He said he didn't think
I should play football.

39:47.585 --> 39:48.950
That it might be dangerous.

39:49.053 --> 39:50.953
I don't think you have
to worry about that.

39:51.055 --> 39:52.113
You're a healthy young man.

39:52.156 --> 39:53.919
Sometimes even
with the best

39:53.958 --> 39:55.323
that medical science
has to offer,

39:55.359 --> 39:56.724
there are anomalies.

39:56.761 --> 39:58.228
And I think that

39:58.262 --> 40:00.321
Dr. Martin's assessment of
your condition is one of them.

40:00.364 --> 40:02.389
So I can play ball?

40:02.433 --> 40:03.661
And do things I've always done?

40:03.701 --> 40:04.929
Till further notice.

40:04.969 --> 40:07.267
Thanks, Doctor.

40:07.304 --> 40:10.501
Man, am I glad
I came to see you.

40:18.315 --> 40:19.942
Well?

40:19.984 --> 40:21.417
I don't know
how to say this.

40:21.452 --> 40:22.248
What?

40:22.286 --> 40:24.220
Well, your father was...

40:24.255 --> 40:25.950
My father was what?

40:28.259 --> 40:30.659
Your father was wrong.
I'm fine.

40:33.063 --> 40:33.995
What's the matter?

40:34.098 --> 40:35.963
I thought you'd
be happy for me.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.467
No, I am.

40:37.501 --> 40:38.695
I'm just a little
surprised.

40:38.736 --> 40:40.363
I mean, my dad's
a good doctor.

40:40.404 --> 40:42.998
I know, but that's what second
opinions are for, aren't they?

40:43.073 --> 40:44.335
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess so.

40:44.375 --> 40:45.808
So be happy for me.

40:45.843 --> 40:47.538
I am. I...

40:47.578 --> 40:49.136
I am.

41:14.538 --> 41:16.199
Excuse me.

41:16.240 --> 41:18.174
Is Bill Taylor's plane
still here?

41:18.209 --> 41:19.676
It took off
ten minutes ago.

41:19.710 --> 41:22.270
Is there something that
I can do for you, Miss?

42:07.825 --> 42:09.224
Dear Kelly...

42:09.260 --> 42:10.591
I'm so sorry.

42:10.628 --> 42:13.597
A great textile deal came along
that I couldn't pass up.

42:13.631 --> 42:15.724
I'm flying off to Milan.

42:15.766 --> 42:19.463
Buy yourself a present and I'll
call you in a couple of weeks.

42:19.503 --> 42:22.165
Love, Dad.

43:22.666 --> 43:24.327
Thanks, Dad.
