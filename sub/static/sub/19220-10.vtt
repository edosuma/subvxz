00:07.160 --> 00:09.080
Let the fun commence.

00:11.280 --> 00:13.520
'This is Ex on the Beach.'

00:16.480 --> 00:20.760
'Eight unsuspecting singles
are looking for love.'

00:20.840 --> 00:23.560
'But what they don't know is...'
Fuck.

00:23.640 --> 00:27.720
'...there are more exes
than ever before.'

00:27.800 --> 00:30.480
My arse just fell out me shorts.
You cheated on me!

00:30.560 --> 00:32.520
Stop acting the fucking big man!

00:32.600 --> 00:35.480
You are my best friend
and I wouldn't do that to you!

00:35.560 --> 00:39.240
'And they're flying in
from everywhere.'

00:39.320 --> 00:42.600
(shouting, laughter)

00:43.960 --> 00:46.800
'Some exes want romance.'

00:46.880 --> 00:48.480
I do really, really love him.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.120
'Some want revenge.'

00:51.200 --> 00:53.520
(screaming)
Both of you, let go now!

00:53.600 --> 00:54.960
Let go now!

00:55.040 --> 00:57.160
No-one fucking likes you!
See you later.

00:57.240 --> 01:00.320
'And others just want to
wreck the gaff.'

01:01.600 --> 01:03.160
Hey!
(clattering)

01:03.240 --> 01:06.000
Fuck! That'll be someone's
fucking head in a minute.

01:06.080 --> 01:09.920
'As always, the Tablet of Terror
is topping up the torment...'

01:10.000 --> 01:12.760
It's going to be fireworks.
'...causing misery...'

01:12.840 --> 01:14.640
(sobs)
What am I gonna do?

01:14.720 --> 01:16.800
You will never, ever
have me ever again.

01:16.880 --> 01:19.040
'...mayhem...'
You fucking dickhead!

01:19.120 --> 01:22.160
(shouting)
'...and madness.'

01:22.240 --> 01:25.520
Oh!
'It's gonna get explosive.'

01:25.600 --> 01:27.640
Or fucking what?!
Ooh!

01:27.720 --> 01:30.440
(shouting)
Fucking slag!

01:30.520 --> 01:33.280
'12 exes have already arrived.'

01:33.360 --> 01:37.520
'But on the last day,
will it be love or war?'

01:37.600 --> 01:39.040
I will smash your face in.

01:39.120 --> 01:41.200
'Whose...'
I hate her guts.

01:41.280 --> 01:43.000
Slag, slag, slag, slag, slag.

01:43.080 --> 01:44.480
'...ex...'

01:44.560 --> 01:45.840
'...is...'

01:47.120 --> 01:48.400
'...next?'

01:48.480 --> 01:50.520
My heart is breaking.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.400
It's the last day in the villa,

02:26.480 --> 02:28.960
I'm absolutely chuffed
I woke up next to Sean.

02:29.040 --> 02:31.720
And we had sex again, for ages.

02:31.800 --> 02:33.840
I've been with Zahida since day one.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.640
She made me laugh,
I'm attracted to her, we had fun,

02:36.720 --> 02:39.360
the experience wouldn't be
the same without her.

02:42.360 --> 02:44.760
Morning, mate.
S'appening? Yous good?

02:46.640 --> 02:49.280
Me and Harriette have been up
and down, up and down.

02:49.360 --> 02:51.000
I did think it was the end,

02:51.080 --> 02:54.000
but then she crawls
in my bed wanting to fuck.

02:54.080 --> 02:55.400
Get under, babe.

02:55.480 --> 02:56.920
I used him, babe.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.640
I wish I could get used.
I got used three times.

02:59.720 --> 03:04.400
I'm so done with the arguments
and the rollercoaster relationship.

03:04.480 --> 03:08.440
When I walk out, I wanna be
walking out with Ross. 100%.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.320
I didn't even kiss him.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.800
Jack and Becca
went in the penthouse?

03:14.880 --> 03:16.840
Oh, yeah.
They haven't come down.

03:16.920 --> 03:20.040
The only reason she went with him
is cos I put it on the table.

03:20.120 --> 03:21.800
Or she was gonna look a mug.

03:25.120 --> 03:27.200
Yo, yo, yo.
S'appening?

03:28.480 --> 03:31.360
How was last night?
Yeah, it was all right.

03:31.440 --> 03:33.120
Did you bang then?
Yeah.

03:33.200 --> 03:37.200
Last night I was going like
a rabbit for about an hour, so,

03:37.280 --> 03:39.880
I don't think she's gonna be
going back to Aaron.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.720
I went to the penthouse with Jack
cos I fancy him like fuck.

03:44.800 --> 03:49.000
Me and Aaron are done. He's getting
with Jenny, I'm getting with Jack.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.920
Today is the last day
and as far as I'm concerned,

03:55.000 --> 03:57.600
me and Becca haven't
sorted anything out.

03:57.680 --> 04:00.520
I don't need her in my life,
so she can fuck off.

04:04.920 --> 04:08.280
I've had the best time in my life
here, especially cos of you.

04:11.160 --> 04:13.040
We've had fun, haven't we?
Yeah.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.400
You've picked us up at my lowest.

04:16.640 --> 04:17.959
That's what I do.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.560
Me and Sean have strong
feelings for each other.

04:20.640 --> 04:22.640
We cuddle and kiss,
that's how we are.

04:22.720 --> 04:25.400
I think I'm in a good place,
this is where I wanna be.

04:25.480 --> 04:29.320
I would never have learned to get
over Joe if I didn't come here

04:29.400 --> 04:33.000
and you've been a massive part of
that, you've made us care about you.

04:33.080 --> 04:34.720
I care about you as well.

04:34.800 --> 04:38.320
All this time I've told Zahida
to keep her feelings at a distance

04:38.400 --> 04:40.640
and all I was doing
was denying my own.

04:40.720 --> 04:44.360
I like this girl. It's the last day
and I'm gonna walk out with her.

04:44.440 --> 04:46.480
Dunno, you're my dream.

04:46.560 --> 04:48.040
(laughs)

04:49.640 --> 04:51.400
I ain't going. Not yet.

04:55.760 --> 04:58.520
I don't think anything
can ruin what me and Sean have.

04:58.600 --> 05:02.200
It's the last day, we've overcome
everything we potentially could.

05:04.040 --> 05:07.080
Actually, it's the last day,
his ex could come in.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.320
'That's right, Zahida.'

05:09.400 --> 05:11.080
'It might be the last day,

05:11.160 --> 05:15.040
but there's still enough time for one
more ex to land on the beach

05:15.120 --> 05:17.280
and wreak havoc in the villa.'

05:17.360 --> 05:20.320
'Whose ex is next?'

05:25.120 --> 05:28.040
You know what, I wanna have
a day where no-one argues.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.040
'Yeah, good luck with that, Ross.'

05:30.120 --> 05:32.080
(Tablet of Terror buzzes)

05:32.160 --> 05:33.440
Oh!

05:33.520 --> 05:34.640
Here we go again.

05:34.720 --> 05:36.280
"Morning, everyone."

05:36.360 --> 05:40.440
"It's the final day in the villa
and a good time to reflect."

05:40.520 --> 05:43.200
"Aaron and Becca,
it's time to go down memory lane

05:43.280 --> 05:44.880
and remember the good times."

05:44.960 --> 05:47.320
(laughter)

05:47.400 --> 05:51.640
I'm going on a date with Aaron, but
I don't want to go after last night.

05:51.720 --> 05:53.280
See you later, Aaron.

05:53.360 --> 05:56.040
The last person I wanna go
on a date with is Becca.

05:56.120 --> 05:59.120
I just hope
there's no fucking arguing.

05:59.200 --> 06:01.720
Aaron's a good sport, man.

06:01.800 --> 06:06.040
I ain't worried. Becca knows
where her bread's buttered.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.400
I feel sorry for Aaron, though.

06:10.600 --> 06:13.400
(laughs) Them eyes, boy.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.040
Obviously it's our last day
and when we get back tomorrow,

06:23.120 --> 06:26.120
you've gotta pack your stuff
at Jacques's and move out.

06:26.200 --> 06:29.280
Obviously I'm worried,
in case you do go back there.

06:29.360 --> 06:31.120
Me and Nicole are in a good place.

06:31.200 --> 06:33.320
When we get out,
it could all change.

06:33.400 --> 06:37.840
I am not going back with Jacques
after being humiliated.

06:37.920 --> 06:40.000
So, you did cheat on her?

06:40.080 --> 06:41.440
You cheated on her?

06:41.520 --> 06:42.880
Fucking idiot, mate.

06:42.960 --> 06:44.640
All I've gotta do is get my stuff.

06:44.720 --> 06:48.120
If you wanna take me out when
I'm home, that will be your choice.

06:48.200 --> 06:52.120
Adam's worried I'm gonna take
Jacques back. It's not gonna happen.

06:52.200 --> 06:55.200
I think it's best to wait for
you to sort your shit out

06:55.280 --> 06:57.000
and then focus on me and you.

06:57.080 --> 07:00.360
There is doubt, cos I know
how strongly she felt about Jacques,

07:00.440 --> 07:03.200
but I wanna give her space
to make her own decision.

07:03.280 --> 07:06.320
Hopefully we get back together.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.840
What, and you really mean that?

07:08.920 --> 07:11.800
Oh!

07:15.040 --> 07:17.680
'With no love lost
between Aaron and Becca,

07:17.760 --> 07:20.720
the Tablet of Terror has sent them
on a treasure hunt date

07:20.800 --> 07:23.400
to reminisce about
their time in the villa.'

07:24.920 --> 07:27.880
This is the last day and the last
chance to speak to Becca,

07:27.960 --> 07:30.280
cos tomorrow
I won't speak to the girl again.

07:30.360 --> 07:34.480
"You've both been getting fruity
and you've found a new squeeze."

07:34.560 --> 07:37.080
"Time to find a shady spot
in the orange trees."

07:37.160 --> 07:38.800
Shady spot in the orange trees?

07:38.880 --> 07:41.600
That's a lime tree.
Oranges that aren't ripe, dick.

07:43.400 --> 07:45.480
I found it!

07:45.560 --> 07:49.280
As soon as I see the picture
of me and Jack, I'm like, oh, fuck.

07:51.440 --> 07:53.920
Let me look. Why? Give us a look.

07:55.120 --> 07:58.400
It's not nice seeing a girl
you care about kissing another man,

07:58.480 --> 08:01.600
but it is what it is
and I'm gonna have to deal with it.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.200
Why did you come in here?

08:03.280 --> 08:05.320
For you. To work things out.

08:05.400 --> 08:09.080
To sort things out, at least...
It doesn't make sense.

08:09.160 --> 08:11.960
It does, though.
Hang on, you know how angry I get.

08:12.040 --> 08:14.200
My decision were based on anger.

08:16.600 --> 08:19.200
The one decision you made
was the penthouse.

08:19.280 --> 08:22.320
I know and I should have
thought about it

08:22.400 --> 08:24.920
and I've said that
and I'm sorry for that as well.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.600
As much as I want to take
Becca's apology, I can't.

08:27.680 --> 08:30.640
I feel like a mug. She's upstairs
having sex with Jack

08:30.720 --> 08:33.000
while I'm downstairs
fucking devastated.

08:33.080 --> 08:36.080
Not being funny, you could
have had me if you wanted us.

08:36.159 --> 08:38.720
Deep down, do you think we'd work?
I dunno.

08:38.799 --> 08:40.240
You didn't give it a chance.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.200
You made sure it would never happen.

08:42.280 --> 08:46.560
Aaron, I shouldn't have done
the things I've done, I know that.

08:46.640 --> 08:48.800
I didn't come here
to get back with you.

08:48.880 --> 08:52.480
You came apparently to get back
with me. I think it's a lie.

08:52.560 --> 08:55.600
Aaron will not accept my apology.

08:55.680 --> 08:59.280
I understand why he's hurt, the fact
I went to the penthouse with Jack

08:59.360 --> 09:01.840
when really I should have
been there with him.

09:07.800 --> 09:09.680
That's fucking nice, isn't it?

09:09.760 --> 09:13.200
It's a picture of Jenny and Aaron.
Why do I wanna see them kissing?

09:13.280 --> 09:14.800
I don't wanna see that.

09:14.880 --> 09:17.320
How come it's OK for you
to do something?

09:17.400 --> 09:18.720
Double standards.

09:18.800 --> 09:22.080
I don't rub it in your face, you do.
How?

09:22.160 --> 09:24.000
The way you were around the pool.

09:24.080 --> 09:26.480
Cos I laid next to her?
Laughing and joking.

09:26.560 --> 09:29.920
You know why? Cos you said
when you came, you think I'm yours.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.080
Obviously, cos I do still love you
deep down, you know that.

09:34.160 --> 09:37.080
I've just seen you in a different
light to what I used to.

09:38.120 --> 09:40.200
(sighs)

09:40.280 --> 09:43.880
This experience has proven
that we should never be together.

09:46.680 --> 09:50.720
Clearly we've hurt each other, so we
need to finish this treasure hunt

09:50.800 --> 09:54.200
and then, as far as I'm concerned,
we can go our separate ways.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.440
(Tablet of Terror buzzes)

10:07.520 --> 10:09.120
(groaning)

10:09.200 --> 10:12.200
Tablet of Terror just rang again,
what do you want now?

10:13.400 --> 10:15.720
"Afternoon.
It's your last day in the villa,

10:15.800 --> 10:17.760
but now all your exes have arrived."

10:19.040 --> 10:20.440
"Can Sean...
(grunts)

10:20.520 --> 10:25.200
"...Ross and Jenny go to the beach
to greet the new arrivals?"

10:25.280 --> 10:28.200
Me, Sean and Ross
are going down to the beach

10:28.280 --> 10:32.040
and Becca and Aaron are on a date,
so I have butterflies.

10:32.120 --> 10:34.760
(laughs) Shit!

10:34.840 --> 10:37.760
Every fucker that's come out
of the sea's caused drama.

10:37.840 --> 10:39.640
I'm just praying it's not my ex.

10:39.720 --> 10:45.040
The thought of Ross's ex coming in
is making me feel really nervous.

10:45.120 --> 10:47.720
To be perfectly honest,
I am shitting myself.

10:47.800 --> 10:50.160
Sean, I reckon it's yours.
You're quiet.

10:50.240 --> 10:53.560
Sean, you've had it way too easy
in here though, mate.

10:53.640 --> 10:55.880
Ain't you?
Fuck. This ain't gonna be good.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.800
In my mind I'm going
absolutely crazy.

11:00.880 --> 11:02.680
We do everything together.

11:02.760 --> 11:05.680
If his ex comes, I'm scared
it'll take him away from us.

11:05.760 --> 11:08.520
It'll be all right,
he's gonna get back with his ex.

11:08.600 --> 11:11.000
Do you want us
to shave your eyebrows off?

11:11.080 --> 11:13.880
Don't worry about it, Z.
Don't worry about it, girl.

11:17.760 --> 11:21.880
We go to the last clue, and surely
it can't be worse than the last two.

11:21.960 --> 11:24.040
Oh, it is as well.

11:24.680 --> 11:25.920
Aww.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.560
It's a picture of me and Aaron
and we do look amazing together.

11:29.640 --> 11:33.400
What I really wanna know is
how Aaron feels about me.

11:36.920 --> 11:38.600
When we are together...

11:40.760 --> 11:41.760
...I'm into it.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.320
Yeah, we are good.

11:44.520 --> 11:47.160
The next person I settle with
is gonna be the person

11:47.240 --> 11:49.760
I wanna be with
for the rest of my life.

11:51.080 --> 11:53.920
But as much as I didn't think
I'd ever say this,

11:54.000 --> 11:56.760
I think now I don't think
we will be anything.

12:01.880 --> 12:04.560
Too much has gone on
to ever go back.

12:06.360 --> 12:09.160
For you to hurt me like you have,
we're not meant to be.

12:09.240 --> 12:11.880
You would never hurt someone
you wanna be with.

12:11.960 --> 12:13.120
I know.

12:13.200 --> 12:17.840
He'll never get back with me. I hurt
him too much, which I understand,

12:17.920 --> 12:22.160
but really, deep down, I'm thinking,
mate, I still love you.

12:23.160 --> 12:26.000
I wish things coulda been different.
Me too. I know.

12:26.080 --> 12:30.360
It's my fault.
Like, the decisions I've made.

12:30.440 --> 12:32.440
Like, I'm not saying it's not.

12:33.680 --> 12:35.520
I am stupid for that.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.640
You don't have to get upset.
See what I mean?

12:40.720 --> 12:44.400
Seeing Becca upset breaks my heart.
Clearly we care about each other.

12:44.480 --> 12:49.320
If situations had been different,
we would be leaving as a couple.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.080
This has to be closure,
so we'll leave the villa as friends.

12:55.160 --> 12:58.320
I'd rather have one more friend
than one less.

12:58.400 --> 13:01.360
We're gonna try and be mates.
Give us a cuddle.

13:03.920 --> 13:06.360
Happy ending. Ish.

13:13.240 --> 13:16.440
'So, there's no fairy-tale ending
for Aaron and Becca,

13:16.520 --> 13:20.720
and over at the beach,
the nightmare is just beginning.'

13:20.800 --> 13:23.280
Everything's good till I sit down.

13:23.360 --> 13:26.480
I'm shitting it. I've not had
an ex yet. This could be mine.

13:26.560 --> 13:29.560
I think I'd work it well,
but I don't think she would.

13:31.160 --> 13:32.840
With what's going on with Aaron,

13:32.920 --> 13:37.720
I still would be worried, cos you
never know which one it could be.

13:37.800 --> 13:39.720
I've had an easy ride in this villa.

13:39.800 --> 13:44.040
I've been to the beach twice and
swerved it. It could be different.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.600
Fuck this.

14:01.160 --> 14:03.160
Are you feeling a bit touchy?

14:03.240 --> 14:05.880
Yeah, I'm nervous.
Shaking my leg like fuck.

14:05.960 --> 14:08.600
Me and Sean have been
together every single night,

14:08.680 --> 14:11.000
every morning,
we do everything together.

14:11.080 --> 14:14.160
I Sean's ex comes in,
I dunno how I'm gonna react.

14:14.240 --> 14:17.200
I do think positive, but when
something plays on my mind,

14:17.280 --> 14:19.360
I turn into a little fucking psycho.

14:19.440 --> 14:22.600
I've just ate two slices of cheese
as well, cos I felt sad.

14:22.680 --> 14:25.920
He's a nice guy and he's gonna
come back and it's gonna be fine.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.520
I hope so. I wind myself up,
so I'm a nutter with a bad temper.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.280
I'm feeling fucking shit.

14:32.360 --> 14:35.520
I'm putting on a brave face,
but I dunno how long it will last.

14:35.600 --> 14:38.040
I feel like any minute
I'm gonna crumble.

14:43.680 --> 14:44.680
I'm shitting it.

14:44.760 --> 14:48.000
If your ex came in, would she
be fuming at your situation?

14:48.080 --> 14:52.200
Problem is, mate, if my ex came in,
bad as it sounds, I'd drop Zahida.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.320
What?

14:54.400 --> 14:55.560
(rewinding)

14:55.640 --> 14:57.920
If my ex came in,
I would drop Zahida.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.400
Are you fucking serious?

14:59.480 --> 15:02.280
If Zahida knew that,
she'd be heartbroken.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.360
With any ex?
With any of them.

15:04.440 --> 15:08.000
Ross and Jenny seem shocked,
but my exes are both good looking.

15:08.080 --> 15:11.360
I know if they came in,
I'd drop Zahida. I like them more.

15:15.720 --> 15:17.120
Oh, fuck.

15:20.040 --> 15:21.600
Oh!

15:36.640 --> 15:38.440
(laughs) Oh, shit.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.000
I dunno what to say.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.640
I'm Ross. Nice to meet you.

15:41.720 --> 15:43.400
I'm Taylor.
Pleased to meet you.

15:43.480 --> 15:45.920
Hey, Taylor, I'm Jenny.
Nice to meet you.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.960
Taylor. We had it off big time
before we came to the villa.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.800
I dunno what to think.

15:50.880 --> 15:53.200
She's not mine, she's not yours.

15:53.280 --> 15:54.280
You all right?

15:58.360 --> 16:03.480
I'm Taylor, I'm 21. I'm the nice
girl. That is, until you cross me.

16:03.560 --> 16:06.200
Sean likes everyone
to think he's the good guy,

16:06.280 --> 16:11.600
when really, he's a manipulating,
lying, cheating little dickhead.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.760
Make sure you put that on,
that was good.

16:13.840 --> 16:17.440
No doubt Sean's got a new girl in the
villa wrapped around his finger.

16:17.520 --> 16:22.600
If so, I'm gonna come out there and
show this girl exactly who he is.

16:22.680 --> 16:26.360
I'm coming out there to get revenge.
Sean, go fuck yourself.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.680
You're a manipulative prick.

16:30.760 --> 16:33.560
You said he's a manipulative prick,
what do you mean?

16:33.640 --> 16:35.680
He says things you want to hear.

16:35.760 --> 16:38.520
He knows how to get in your head.
Really?Yes.

16:38.600 --> 16:39.920
Very much so.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
Tell me, I wanna know all.
I wanna know the goss.

16:43.080 --> 16:45.800
Well, we was basically
seeing each other last year

16:45.880 --> 16:49.080
and he was still seeing his ex
at the same time as seeing me.

16:49.160 --> 16:53.520
Sean's always battling about morals,
but turns out he's a cheat.

16:53.600 --> 16:56.760
I'd see you kick off
cos your ex was getting with people.

16:56.840 --> 16:59.600
What am I meant to think?
You were a prick to me.

16:59.680 --> 17:01.240
Taylor's got a lot on her mind.

17:01.320 --> 17:04.079
The only words coming out are
"Fuck off" and "Prick".

17:04.160 --> 17:06.599
Not looking forward
to saying about Zahida.

17:06.680 --> 17:08.440
I've cracked on with other girls.

17:08.520 --> 17:11.839
It doesn't bother me.
They obviously don't know you.

17:11.920 --> 17:15.079
We got the penthouse.
You banged on the first night?

17:15.160 --> 17:17.599
He was sat there grinning
cos he finds it funny.

17:17.680 --> 17:19.680
He doesn't understand what he's done.

17:19.760 --> 17:21.400
Do you wanna work things out?

17:21.480 --> 17:25.079
Do you wanna know where you stand
and why he did what he did?

17:25.160 --> 17:29.160
I'd just like some closure.
Yeah, you want a chat and closure?

17:29.240 --> 17:31.400
Have you still got feelings for him?

17:31.480 --> 17:35.240
I'll say it first,
I do have feelings for you.

17:35.320 --> 17:39.480
If you had feelings, you wouldn't
have done the things you did.

17:39.560 --> 17:40.840
I didn't wanna commit.

17:40.920 --> 17:45.280
This is the thing with the girl I've
got now, she's more attached to me.

17:45.360 --> 17:48.160
Why don't you tell her?
You know you'll hurt her.

17:48.240 --> 17:49.920
I felt sorry for her.

17:51.240 --> 17:52.440
That's muggy, mate.

17:52.520 --> 17:54.520
It started off
cos her ex gave her shit.

17:54.600 --> 17:57.760
I went to make her experience
more fun by being there for her.

17:57.840 --> 18:02.080
Sean said he only got with Zahida
cos he felt sorry for her.

18:02.160 --> 18:04.920
He is a massive prick. Massively.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
You look good, anyway.
Fuck off.

18:08.160 --> 18:11.680
You do look good.
Fuck off. Prick.

18:11.760 --> 18:13.240
(Tablet of Terror buzzes)

18:13.320 --> 18:17.480
Oh, shit. Whoa, ho, ho.

18:17.560 --> 18:20.840
"Welcome to the beach, Taylor.
You're off on a date with Sean."

18:21.920 --> 18:24.880
"Ignite your flame?
Or wish it never happened?"

18:24.960 --> 18:26.680
I'm not gonna lie, I'm happy.

18:26.760 --> 18:30.240
It's gonna give us time to sort our
heads out and see where we stand.

18:30.320 --> 18:32.800
Are you excited?
I'm excited to talk.

18:32.880 --> 18:36.360
This is my time to say how I feel
and hopefully get an apology.

18:36.440 --> 18:38.360
Lovely to meet you, Taylor.
You too.

18:38.440 --> 18:40.480
See you later.
She's got a good bum.

18:46.680 --> 18:51.000
I hear the door slam, I'm hoping
it's Sean, but it's Aaron and Becca.

18:51.080 --> 18:53.160
(cheering)

18:53.240 --> 18:56.080
Oh, look at that,
a trip down memory lane.

18:56.160 --> 18:58.640
(all) Aww.

19:00.920 --> 19:02.080
How was your date?

19:02.160 --> 19:04.800
Was it emotional?
It was emotional.

19:04.880 --> 19:08.800
We made up and became best friends.
We've just been having a laugh.

19:08.880 --> 19:11.480
Did you leave with a friendly kiss?
Nah.

19:11.560 --> 19:15.280
Aaron and Becca have their closure,
so I'll be in the penthouse tonight

19:15.360 --> 19:17.640
sipping champagne and banging Becca.

19:17.720 --> 19:20.040
'Ah, who said romance was dead?'

19:20.120 --> 19:23.680
It was nice to, after two years,
close whatever happened

19:23.760 --> 19:25.400
and start afresh as friends.

19:32.080 --> 19:36.760
"Over on their date, it's time to see
if Sean can win back Taylor."

19:36.840 --> 19:38.600
So, what is it you've come out for?

19:38.680 --> 19:40.400
Closure and an apology.

19:40.480 --> 19:43.280
You were vile to me.
The right girl, wrong time.

19:43.360 --> 19:45.640
Taylor coming in
puts me in a predicament.

19:45.720 --> 19:47.920
I'm attracted to her,
she looks great.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.160
It was left pretty sore,
and I still have feelings for you.

19:51.240 --> 19:53.080
I don't believe anything he says.

19:53.160 --> 19:56.920
He's told me lie after lie after lie
and it's just what I'm used to now.

19:57.000 --> 20:01.520
I'm physically attracted to you
more than I am with Zahida.

20:01.600 --> 20:04.360
I'd like to think we could
develop things again.

20:05.400 --> 20:08.000
Who the fuck does he think he is?
He's seeing a girl

20:08.080 --> 20:10.680
and he's gonna crack on with me?
I don't think so.

20:10.760 --> 20:15.480
You're willing to go to the villa,
tell Zahida you don't wanna see her?

20:15.560 --> 20:18.200
You're just gonna cut things off?
I'll do it later.

20:18.280 --> 20:21.200
You think she'll be happy?
She'll probably glass me.

20:21.280 --> 20:24.440
What a load of shit.
He's treating Zahida like a dog.

20:24.520 --> 20:28.520
I'm gonna go in there and show
everyone what a prick Sean is

20:28.600 --> 20:30.680
and to royally fuck him over.

20:35.040 --> 20:37.240
Cheers to the last night, yeah?

20:37.320 --> 20:38.680
(cheering)

20:38.760 --> 20:41.200
It's the last night,
we're all having drinks

20:41.280 --> 20:43.360
all on a high,
this is gonna be mint.

20:43.440 --> 20:44.520
I'm so excited.

20:44.600 --> 20:47.240
I feel like I've made
friends for life.

20:48.800 --> 20:52.360
Love you all. Adam, I never thought
I'd say this, but I love you too.

20:52.440 --> 20:54.760
(cheering)

20:54.840 --> 20:57.360
I do love Adam.
We're in such a good place.

20:57.440 --> 20:59.680
See where the future takes us.
I love you

20:59.760 --> 21:03.000
I love you too.
(cheering)

21:03.080 --> 21:05.440
Deep down, I knew Nicole
was in love with me.

21:05.520 --> 21:08.880
I'm glad she told the truth
and showed her feelings.

21:10.080 --> 21:11.560
Where the fuck are they?

21:11.640 --> 21:14.720
Everyone's having a great time,
but all I can think about

21:14.800 --> 21:18.200
is where the hell's Sean? It's
getting late. Sean, where are you?

21:18.280 --> 21:21.240
(cheering)

21:21.320 --> 21:26.400
Ross and Jenny have come back
and Zahida's face has dropped.

21:26.480 --> 21:28.680
There's no Sean.
It was Sean's ex.

21:28.760 --> 21:30.280
Fuck off.

21:30.360 --> 21:32.720
Yeah, she's called Taylor.
What the hell?

21:32.800 --> 21:35.920
Basically, he said if his ex came in
he was gonna drop you.

21:37.800 --> 21:40.040
Wow.
What the fuck?

21:40.120 --> 21:42.840
She saying he's
a really manipulative person.

21:42.920 --> 21:46.240
He sells a dream
and he can't commit.

21:46.320 --> 21:47.840
Fuck.

21:47.920 --> 21:50.880
What, so he said to you
he's gonna drop me for her?

21:50.960 --> 21:53.600
Yeah.
I feel so stupid.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.360
I believed him all along.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.360
It shows you
what a little man he is.

21:57.440 --> 21:59.840
No surprise to me.
You're a snake, mate.

21:59.920 --> 22:03.320
We all see it, babe. I think Sean
should be shitting himself now.

22:07.120 --> 22:11.480
I know what it's like to be blinded
by love and that's what's happening.

22:11.560 --> 22:13.320
She needs her friends around.

22:13.400 --> 22:18.720
The person I cared about has
is the opposite of what I thought.

22:18.800 --> 22:21.720
Listen to me, you've gotta take
my advice, hear him out.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.760
You'll be able to tell
if he's lying.

22:23.840 --> 22:27.760
I'm livid, but I'm trying
to stay calm for Zahida.

22:27.840 --> 22:31.720
Look how beautiful you are, he's
punching above his sack of potatoes.

22:31.800 --> 22:33.440
I'm fucking fuming at Sean.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.800
He comes in,
fills her head with shit.

22:35.880 --> 22:39.480
He's a compulsive liar, I think
he's Pinocchio's brother to be fair.

22:39.560 --> 22:42.440
I don't believe
a word he says any more.

22:42.520 --> 22:47.720
I would never toy with anyone's
emotions the way Sean has with mine.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.120
I can't even talk.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.440
(weeps)

22:53.480 --> 22:57.680
I'm not gonna lie, like, I really
feel sorry for her. I believed him.

22:57.760 --> 23:00.040
Let's be honest,
he's saying to all of us

23:00.120 --> 23:02.920
that they're both single,
so why's he getting upset?

23:03.000 --> 23:04.840
Josh, he's not telling her that.

23:04.920 --> 23:07.960
He says one thing to Zahida
and one thing to everyone else.

23:08.040 --> 23:09.840
The kid is a two-faced prick.

23:09.920 --> 23:12.200
I backed him up all day.
He's a waste man.

23:19.480 --> 23:22.200
'With the last night
turning into a Greek tragedy,

23:22.280 --> 23:26.800
the Tablet of Terror has organised
a big, fat Greek wedding.'

23:26.880 --> 23:29.640
Wait, I'm the bride
and Sean's the groom.

23:29.720 --> 23:31.040
Fuck Sean!

23:31.120 --> 23:32.440
'This should go well.'

23:32.520 --> 23:34.120
Cheers to Zahida's wedding.

23:34.200 --> 23:37.240
Cheers to my wedding.
My groom is cheating on us.

23:37.320 --> 23:41.960
This has taken the emphasis off
them, everyone's having a good time.

23:42.040 --> 23:46.120
Cheers to everyone that's not made
it, been thrown out, or dropped out.

23:46.200 --> 23:49.040
(all) Cheers.

23:49.120 --> 23:51.720
I'm here so I can
sort it out with Zahida.

23:51.800 --> 23:54.120
Have you shagged her?
Straight up, yeah.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.800
Fuck! You're a little slag. Fuck!

23:56.880 --> 23:58.800
Fuck! Fuck!

23:58.880 --> 24:00.760
Get me outta here!

24:00.840 --> 24:02.880
Cheers to Josh throwing Alex out.

24:02.960 --> 24:05.120
(cheering)

24:05.200 --> 24:06.760
All I wanna do is talk to Alice.

24:06.840 --> 24:08.600
Can't wait to see her and chat.

24:08.680 --> 24:11.080
(cheering, screaming)

24:11.160 --> 24:13.240
I don't wanna be with you, Alex.

24:13.320 --> 24:17.080
I just wanna be with you,
Alice, man. So bad.

24:17.160 --> 24:18.320
(sniffles)

24:18.400 --> 24:23.760
I'm glad I kicked Alex out, but also,
I'm glad Alice went. She was a bore.

24:23.840 --> 24:26.320
Boring.
Who the fuck's Alice?

24:26.400 --> 24:28.720
Who else is left? Zara went.

24:28.800 --> 24:29.840
Cheers to that.

24:31.720 --> 24:34.240
ZaraLena, she's like
the Grim Reaper.

24:34.320 --> 24:36.280
Sucking people's lives and souls.

24:37.640 --> 24:40.480
You're so negative.
She's boring as fuck.

24:43.080 --> 24:44.640
Whatever.

24:44.720 --> 24:45.960
Fuck 'em.

24:49.800 --> 24:52.640
I've come here to tell you
I love you, Nic.

24:52.720 --> 24:56.280
Adam told me you cheated on me.
It's bullshit.

24:56.360 --> 24:59.320
If I found out he was lying,
I'd cut his penis off.

24:59.400 --> 25:01.840
Tell the truth,
cos you're mugging off Nicole.

25:01.920 --> 25:04.160
So, you did cheat on her?

25:06.800 --> 25:09.960
You are my best friend
and I wouldn't do that to you!

25:10.040 --> 25:11.920
How can you do that to me?

25:12.000 --> 25:13.440
Oh, Chanelle!

25:13.520 --> 25:16.840
(screaming)

25:16.920 --> 25:20.440
You dunno if you'll wake up to me
stabbing you, or sucking you off.

25:20.520 --> 25:21.800
Fucking cunt!

25:21.880 --> 25:23.600
(screams)

25:25.640 --> 25:26.720
(screams)

25:26.800 --> 25:29.720
Woo! Shake your titties.

25:29.800 --> 25:32.080
(screams)

25:35.200 --> 25:37.320
'With Sean still late
for his own wedding

25:37.400 --> 25:41.040
Harriette takes the opportunity
to steal the limelight.'

25:41.120 --> 25:46.080
My best moment was, without a doubt,
our first date where we met.

25:46.160 --> 25:48.280
I realised, fuck,
I really like this guy.

25:48.360 --> 25:52.600
As cringey as it sounds,
you are head-to-toe my type.

25:52.680 --> 25:54.720
Really? He's really hot.

25:58.600 --> 26:03.280
And my worst moments
are when I get drunk

26:03.360 --> 26:05.440
and I say stupid shit.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.000
Fucking cunt!

26:07.080 --> 26:08.440
Let me go!

26:08.520 --> 26:12.120
Shit, shit, shit. I'm done, mate.

26:12.200 --> 26:15.400
And the thing is, I've realised
that's really immature.

26:15.480 --> 26:19.240
You've taught me a lot. I need to
grow up and not bite at shit.

26:19.320 --> 26:21.720
When Harriette stops
shouting down my ear,

26:21.800 --> 26:24.200
I think she's amazing
and I do really like her.

26:24.280 --> 26:26.040
I smile all day, everyday.

26:26.120 --> 26:28.520
(Tablet of Terror buzzes)

26:28.600 --> 26:30.120
(groaning)

26:30.200 --> 26:33.800
The Tablet goes off, what's going
on? We're having a good wedding.

26:33.880 --> 26:38.240
"Good evening, every good wedding
needs honesty."

26:38.320 --> 26:39.400
"Here's Ross."

26:41.240 --> 26:45.160
I had a date with you yesterday
and that was the best day I've had.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.520
(laughter)

26:49.600 --> 26:52.040
Shit. What the fuck have I done?

26:57.200 --> 27:01.520
We told you straight we had
a laugh on the date, didn't we?

27:01.600 --> 27:05.640
Ross is saying he's had a better
time with me than Harriette.

27:05.720 --> 27:07.720
Fucking hell.
What the fuck?

27:08.720 --> 27:11.720
What the fuck? The best day
you've had in the villa, Ross?

27:11.800 --> 27:12.800
The best day?

27:12.880 --> 27:16.120
I love Ross to pieces,
but he shouldn't have said that.

27:16.200 --> 27:18.400
That's hurt her.
Ross?

27:18.480 --> 27:20.560
That was the best day you had?

27:20.640 --> 27:23.040
Say something,
cos you're awfully quiet.

27:24.760 --> 27:26.920
That was the best day? With her?

27:27.000 --> 27:28.640
I had a good time,
we had a laugh.

27:28.720 --> 27:31.480
I said when we came back.
That was the best day you had?

27:31.560 --> 27:34.520
No, it wasn't.
That's what you said. Is that lying?

27:36.120 --> 27:38.160
I'm lying, obviously, on there.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.440
You're lying on there?
Yeah.

27:40.520 --> 27:43.600
She's fuming. I don't think
we'll come back from this.

27:43.680 --> 27:47.360
The best day you had was with her?
No, it wasn't. We had a great time.

27:47.440 --> 27:50.840
We were laughing and I wasn't
getting shouted at like this again.

27:50.920 --> 27:53.360
He pretended
to actually give a shit.

27:53.440 --> 27:58.120
And one date meant more than
countless hours, minutes, seconds.

27:58.200 --> 28:02.880
Fucking every single moment
we shared together meant nothing!

28:02.960 --> 28:07.640
But one date with a bird he hardly
knows means everything?!

28:07.720 --> 28:09.720
Am I a fucking dickhead?

28:09.800 --> 28:13.560
In my head, it's game over.
Harriette's never gonna speak to me.

28:15.120 --> 28:17.520
What can I say? I fucked up.

28:17.600 --> 28:18.960
He sucked me in.

28:20.320 --> 28:22.400
And he spat me out.

28:27.640 --> 28:31.520
'Ross's betrayal has cast
a dark cloud over proceedings.'

28:31.600 --> 28:34.400
'But for Zahida,
there's a bigger storm brewing.'

28:35.400 --> 28:37.560
I can't stop looking that way.

28:37.640 --> 28:42.000
I keep looking to see if the villa
door opens and Sean's gonna walk in.

28:42.080 --> 28:44.120
It's only 11.30pm.

28:44.200 --> 28:45.400
I'm winding myself up.

28:45.480 --> 28:49.560
Everyone's trying to keep us calm.
I'm losing patience. I'm annoyed.

28:50.800 --> 28:53.640
The tension is bubbling
in this villa tonight.

28:53.720 --> 28:57.560
I cannot wait to see
how fit Sean's ex is. (laughs)

29:00.320 --> 29:03.800
'Calm down, Josh,
you won't have long to wait.'

29:03.880 --> 29:05.480
Guys, guys, guys.

29:05.560 --> 29:08.680
Why are they holding hands?
Are yous fucking joking?

29:08.760 --> 29:12.200
Sean's walking in
hand-in-hand with his ex.

29:12.280 --> 29:13.840
Is he serious right now?

29:15.920 --> 29:19.200
Mate, you are asking to be cremated.

29:19.280 --> 29:21.000
Is he having a fucking laugh?

29:23.600 --> 29:26.000
He's a fucking piss-taker.

29:29.800 --> 29:32.320
Why are you holding her hand?
Like, seriously?

29:32.400 --> 29:35.280
Why are you doing that?
I like her. We had a nice date.

29:35.360 --> 29:37.880
Sean thinks he's holding my hand
to reassure me,

29:37.960 --> 29:40.920
but I'm now here to make sure
everyone knows who he is.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.960
There's a judgement being made here.

29:43.040 --> 29:46.320
I introduced Taylor and everyone
piped down and said fuck all.

29:46.400 --> 29:49.920
Everyone say fucking hello to her.
Hang on, don't tell us what to do.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.880
Why you piping up?
Why am I piping up?

29:51.960 --> 29:54.440
You dunno what's gone on.
I ain't got a clue.

29:54.520 --> 29:57.640
You seem different to the guy
I knew three weeks ago.

29:57.720 --> 30:00.560
Everyone's having it off with me,
giving me grief.

30:00.640 --> 30:03.360
They dunno what happened.
I haven't kissed Taylor.

30:03.440 --> 30:05.240
Z's hurt. Look how hurt she is.

30:05.320 --> 30:08.560
I know. She was hurt when Joe
was here and I picked her up.

30:08.640 --> 30:12.560
OK. Well, why have you picked her up
and made her feel like shit?

30:12.640 --> 30:15.400
When you said we're ending
the experience together,

30:15.480 --> 30:18.960
how do you think it feels for me
watching you walk in with someone?

30:19.040 --> 30:21.400
He's been making himself out to be

30:21.480 --> 30:24.320
the most amazing person ever
in front of everyone.

30:24.400 --> 30:28.760
Now that his ex is here,
who the fuck is he?

30:31.400 --> 30:32.480
Let Taylor speak.

30:32.560 --> 30:37.160
Sean's been playing a game, but now
I'm here and I'm gonna fuck it up.

30:37.240 --> 30:39.800
I came here to get closure,
an apology,

30:39.880 --> 30:42.200
but after what he said to me,
it's different.

30:42.280 --> 30:43.480
What's he said?

30:43.560 --> 30:47.280
Basically if I came in
he'd sack Zahida off.

30:47.360 --> 30:50.080
That's wrong.
No, it's definitely not.

30:50.160 --> 30:53.480
You said that you got with Zahida
cos you felt sorry for her.

30:53.560 --> 30:57.040
Fuck off. That's fucking wrong.
That's fucking wrong.

30:57.120 --> 31:00.160
Why don't you tell her?
Cos you know you're gonna hurt her.

31:00.240 --> 31:02.040
I felt sorry for her.

31:02.120 --> 31:06.160
(weeping) You get the fuck out,
you fucking horrible prick.

31:09.040 --> 31:11.960
Sean is a massive fucking liar!

31:12.040 --> 31:15.760
He said that he cares about us,
and the only reason he gets with us

31:15.840 --> 31:18.360
is because he feels sorry for us.

31:18.440 --> 31:19.640
(crying)

31:19.720 --> 31:21.720
Sean has been exposed
for what he is.

31:21.800 --> 31:24.320
He's a lying, manipulative prick.

31:24.400 --> 31:27.000
Bruv, you're a dickhead.
You're a fucking idiot.

31:27.080 --> 31:30.840
Everyone turned on me. I thought we
were pals, why you giving me grief?

31:30.920 --> 31:32.240
You are a prick.

31:32.320 --> 31:35.160
Selling the girl a dream, bruv.
Selling a girl a dream.

31:35.240 --> 31:36.760
(applause)
You're a prick.

31:36.840 --> 31:39.560
Sean acts like he's a saviour
for all these girls,

31:39.640 --> 31:41.520
but really he treats them like shit.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.800
If I wasn't in here, I'd punch you.

31:43.880 --> 31:45.640
Come on then.
Fucking idiot.

31:45.720 --> 31:47.360
You are a fucking idiot.

31:47.440 --> 31:49.920
You are a fucking idiot.
I will smash your face.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.560
Sean's true colours have been
splattered over the venue tonight.

31:54.640 --> 31:56.840
He looks like
a fucking massive cock.

32:00.480 --> 32:02.640
I'm sorry you have to
meet us like this.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.320
I'm really angry.

32:04.400 --> 32:07.400
By the thing she's said,
I think I need to talk to Taylor.

32:07.480 --> 32:08.960
I need to hear it for myself.

32:09.040 --> 32:11.640
Drop me? That his words?
Yeah.

32:11.720 --> 32:15.000
He's vile. He said he only got with
you cos he felt sorry for you,

32:15.080 --> 32:17.160
cos you had shit
going on with your ex.

32:18.160 --> 32:21.680
So he doesn't care about us?
He doesn't give a shit about you.

32:24.800 --> 32:27.200
He obviously doesn't care about us.

32:27.280 --> 32:29.040
I'm nothing.

32:29.120 --> 32:30.640
Me, you and him have to talk.

32:30.720 --> 32:33.560
Everything you said
needs to be said in front of him.

32:33.640 --> 32:36.320
I do not want that boy
to lie to my face any more.

32:36.400 --> 32:39.040
Who the fuck does Sean think he is?

32:39.120 --> 32:41.960
You messed with my emotions,
you've played us,

32:42.040 --> 32:44.200
now you've dropped us
like a bag of shit.

32:44.280 --> 32:46.600
He thinks he can
get away with it constantly.

32:46.680 --> 32:48.560
Well, he's not now.

32:48.640 --> 32:51.680
I'm not listening
to Sean's bullshit a moment longer.

32:54.200 --> 32:57.880
'Sean's not the only one
who's got explaining to do.'

32:57.960 --> 33:00.200
I need to talk to you properly.
OK.

33:01.200 --> 33:04.640
I can't even begin to tell you
how much pain I'm in now.

33:05.640 --> 33:07.280
I'm broken.

33:07.360 --> 33:10.120
I did not mean that
at all like that.

33:10.200 --> 33:11.760
That's not the best day for me.

33:11.840 --> 33:14.120
Yeah, I did say that on the video.

33:14.200 --> 33:19.120
At this point,
I look like a class-A bellend.

33:19.200 --> 33:21.200
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

33:22.200 --> 33:23.880
You really fucking hurt me.

33:23.960 --> 33:26.440
I think I fucked it up.

33:26.520 --> 33:28.920
(sighs)

33:29.000 --> 33:31.640
(exhales loudly)

33:33.520 --> 33:36.800
At the end of the day, I wanna be
with you and you wanna be with me.

33:36.880 --> 33:38.840
Right or wrong?

33:41.960 --> 33:43.480
Don't do that sad face.

33:45.280 --> 33:47.360
Oh, fuck.

33:52.800 --> 33:54.480
I've got a lot of making up to do,

33:54.560 --> 33:58.440
but I said I wanted to leave the
same way I started, with Harriette.

33:58.520 --> 34:01.160
Don't fucking hurt me.
I won't hurt you. Promise.

34:06.120 --> 34:08.199
'With Ross and Harriette back on,

34:08.280 --> 34:10.560
the rest of the villa
have a ringside seat

34:10.639 --> 34:14.719
as Zahida and Taylor take on Sean.'

34:14.800 --> 34:17.760
So, why say you'd cut things
off with her and then...

34:17.840 --> 34:18.880
I didn't say that.

34:18.960 --> 34:22.080
You did. You said you was
gonna cut it off and be with me.

34:22.159 --> 34:24.120
I am absolutely fucking fuming.

34:24.199 --> 34:27.800
He's making me out to be a liar,
when he knows what he said.

34:27.880 --> 34:29.920
I said it would be nice to see...

34:30.000 --> 34:31.560
Oh, nice?
You know what?

34:31.639 --> 34:33.639
Straight away, fuck that.

34:33.719 --> 34:37.880
Hang on, you did say you're
interested to see how it develops?

34:37.960 --> 34:41.920
As much as I said, like...
You made us look like a cock.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.960
It's like he doesn't give a shit
about the lies he's told.

34:45.040 --> 34:46.440
He's forgot his story.

34:46.520 --> 34:50.639
You were sat on the beach saying you
only got with me cos you felt sorry.

34:50.719 --> 34:52.480
I felt sorry for you. You was low.

34:52.560 --> 34:55.000
So, his cock dropped in you
cos he felt sorry.

34:55.080 --> 34:57.480
We went to the penthouse
and she came on to me.

34:57.560 --> 35:00.800
Sean is making himself
look like a dick right now.

35:00.880 --> 35:02.640
You obviously won't carry on now.

35:02.720 --> 35:04.520
I will carry on.

35:04.600 --> 35:07.440
You gonna sleep with him?
I ain't gonna sleep with you.

35:07.520 --> 35:10.360
I don't need to sleep with you.
He's working on this.

35:10.440 --> 35:12.400
What Taylor's saying is bullshit.

35:12.480 --> 35:14.760
In minutes she turned
everyone against me.

35:14.840 --> 35:16.800
Do you know what? You're a slag.

35:16.880 --> 35:18.840
Oi, Sean, don't talk like that, bruv.

35:18.920 --> 35:22.400
I'm not shit-stirring, you just
don't like being caught out.

35:24.560 --> 35:26.080
Let me up, man.

35:26.160 --> 35:28.480
I dunno how much more I can take.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.840
He's doing my fucking nut in.

35:30.920 --> 35:34.640
Oi, listen. I say, yeah, in here

35:34.720 --> 35:37.880
you've been the first geezer
to pipe up to a lot of geezers

35:37.960 --> 35:40.880
about piping up to girls,
you're a womaniser.

35:40.960 --> 35:43.520
You come in on a game...
Selling fake dreams.

35:43.600 --> 35:46.760
You make yourself look like
Superman when you're not, mate.

35:46.840 --> 35:50.200
You're clever. You're a coward
and you're clever.

35:53.200 --> 35:56.080
So, she's a mug?
You're calling her a mug?

35:56.160 --> 35:57.960
Why are you calling a girl a mug?

35:58.040 --> 36:00.480
Why are you calling a girl a mug?

36:00.560 --> 36:02.440
Why are you calling a girl a mug?

36:02.520 --> 36:04.200
Z, I'll be on the bed.

36:04.280 --> 36:06.760
No, she don't wanna talk,
go on your own.

36:06.840 --> 36:08.600
Adam, fuck off, mate.

36:08.680 --> 36:11.480
(Tablet of Terror buzzes)

36:11.560 --> 36:15.720
It's all kicking off and then the
tablet goes off. What is going on?

36:15.800 --> 36:17.640
"Good evening. It's the last night

36:17.720 --> 36:20.480
and it's time to pick
who gets the penthouse."

36:20.560 --> 36:22.640
"Sean, it's your choice."

36:22.720 --> 36:24.800
"Taylor, or Zahida?"

36:26.720 --> 36:28.880
Zahida.

36:28.960 --> 36:31.680
Is he all right?
Like, literally is he joking?

36:34.200 --> 36:35.360
Let him go on his own.

36:35.440 --> 36:37.840
Let him go on his own.
He's a dickhead.

36:37.920 --> 36:40.040
We've told her,
so we've all done our bit.

36:40.120 --> 36:44.160
If she wants to go, it's up to her,
but she'll get her heart broken.

36:44.240 --> 36:47.440
Zahida, he has picked you
cos she has pied him.

36:49.880 --> 36:52.480
Zahida better not go
to that penthouse with Sean.

36:52.560 --> 36:54.720
He mugged her off
and she needs to see it.

36:54.800 --> 36:57.800
He has just fucking mugged you.
Don't listen to him.

36:57.880 --> 36:58.960
He's a fucking liar.

36:59.040 --> 37:01.920
Bigger picture, remember.
Remember the big picture.

37:07.560 --> 37:11.360
Come on, let go of that shit now,
drop him out.

37:14.440 --> 37:17.400
Why do you want us now?
You wanted Taylor two seconds ago.

37:20.360 --> 37:22.720
Now suddenly you want us again?

37:22.800 --> 37:26.520
No, thank you. I'll go and drink
by myself. You can fuck off.

37:26.600 --> 37:29.160
(cheering)
Well done, girl.

37:29.240 --> 37:31.960
(applause)

37:34.200 --> 37:37.800
You broke my heart.
Do not ever come near me again.

37:53.520 --> 37:56.000
The only thing I want smashed
is my vagina.

38:01.640 --> 38:03.800
(laughs)

38:10.360 --> 38:13.200
I am leaving this villa
fully single.

38:13.280 --> 38:16.120
I'm going back to Newcastle
and doing what I always do,

38:16.200 --> 38:17.520
shag and get pissed.

38:17.600 --> 38:21.560
Although me and Ross have had
a rollercoaster time in here,

38:21.640 --> 38:23.400
we are gonna walk out together.

38:32.040 --> 38:35.520
I'm walking out of this villa
with so many new friends

38:35.600 --> 38:38.240
and I've got Adam back in my life.

38:55.320 --> 38:58.520
Little does Sean know we're getting
married, having babies,

38:58.600 --> 39:01.960
we'll have a beautiful house,
cars, go on holiday.

39:02.040 --> 39:04.960
I've got his postcode.
There's no getting away from me.

39:05.040 --> 39:07.320
I'm your future, Sean.

39:07.400 --> 39:09.720
Mrs Pratt. (laughs)
