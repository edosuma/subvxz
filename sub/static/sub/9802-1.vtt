WEBVTT

03:02.217 --> 03:04.884
Kinda lonesome back here.

03:04.886 --> 03:07.654
Yeah, little help.

03:07.656 --> 03:12.592
Okay, um, just, I have to keep
my hands on the wheel.

03:13.795 --> 03:16.029
Excuse me. Whoo!

03:16.031 --> 03:17.864
Ah, Dopinder.

03:17.866 --> 03:19.933
Pool. Dead.

03:21.203 --> 03:22.669
Hmm, nice.

03:23.705 --> 03:24.838
Smells good, no?

03:24.840 --> 03:26.873
Not the Daffodil Daydream.
The girl.

03:26.875 --> 03:28.875
Ah, yes. Gita.

03:28.877 --> 03:30.810
Hmm.
She is quite lovely.

03:30.812 --> 03:33.146
She would have made me
a very agreeable wife.

03:33.148 --> 03:35.215
But, um...

03:35.217 --> 03:38.985
Gita's heart has been stolen
by my cousin Bandhu.

03:38.987 --> 03:42.722
He is as dishonorable
as he is attractive.

03:43.925 --> 03:45.892
Dopinder, I'm starting to think

03:45.894 --> 03:47.827
there's a reason
I'm in this cab today.

03:47.829 --> 03:49.562
Yeah, sir, you called for it,
remember?

03:49.564 --> 03:54.567
No, my slender brown friend.
Love is a beautiful thing.

03:54.569 --> 03:55.969
When you find it,
the whole world

03:55.971 --> 03:57.237
tastes like Daffodil Daydream.

03:58.573 --> 04:00.673
So you gotta hold onto love...

04:00.675 --> 04:01.975
...tight!
Ah.

04:01.977 --> 04:03.510
And never let go.

04:03.512 --> 04:04.978
Don't make
the same mistakes I did.

04:04.980 --> 04:07.748
Got it?
Yeah.

04:07.749 --> 04:10.517
Or else the whole world tastes
like Mama June after hot yoga.

04:10.519 --> 04:12.852
Sir, what does
Miss Mama June taste like?

04:12.854 --> 04:15.855
Like two hobos fucking in a shoe
filled with piss. Okay, enough.

04:15.857 --> 04:18.791
I can go all day, Dopinder.
The point is, it's bad!

04:18.793 --> 04:20.894
Hmm, it's bad.

04:20.896 --> 04:23.730
Uh, why the fancy
red suit, Mr. Pool?

04:23.732 --> 04:25.832
Oh, that's because
it's Christmas Day, Dopinder.

04:25.834 --> 04:28.268
And I'm after someone
on my naughty list.

04:28.270 --> 04:29.969
I've been waiting one year,
three weeks...

04:29.971 --> 04:31.938
six days and, oh...

04:31.940 --> 04:34.274
14 minutes to make him fix
what he did to me.

04:35.911 --> 04:38.211
And what did he do
to you, Mr. Pool?

04:38.213 --> 04:39.746
This shit...

04:40.882 --> 04:41.948
Boo!

05:02.804 --> 05:03.970
They won't disappoint.

05:04.639 --> 05:06.306
They'd better not.

05:06.308 --> 05:08.875
And what about
next month's shipment?

05:08.877 --> 05:10.610
There won't be one.

05:10.612 --> 05:12.252
You're not the only one
with a war to win.

05:13.315 --> 05:14.881
That won't do.

05:17.786 --> 05:20.286
See, we've had
this small disruption

05:20.288 --> 05:21.754
to our supply chain...

05:25.360 --> 05:27.794
We'd appreciate your patience.

05:30.165 --> 05:31.764
Okay.

05:31.766 --> 05:34.233
We'll deliver in full
the following month.

05:37.739 --> 05:39.019
Pleasure doing
business with you.

05:42.744 --> 05:44.611
Fucking mutant.

05:54.356 --> 05:56.022
Oh, shit!

05:56.024 --> 05:57.824
I forgot my ammo bag.

05:57.826 --> 05:58.992
Shall we turn back?

05:58.994 --> 06:00.360
No, no time.

06:00.362 --> 06:02.061
Fuck it. I got this.

06:02.063 --> 06:05.365
9, 10, 11, 12 bullets,
or bust.

06:05.367 --> 06:06.699
Right here!

06:08.370 --> 06:11.070
That's, uh, $27.50.

06:11.072 --> 06:12.872
I... I never carry a wallet
when I'm working.

06:12.874 --> 06:14.741
Ruins the lines
of my suit.

06:14.743 --> 06:15.875
Oh.
But, uh,

06:15.877 --> 06:17.210
how about
a crisp high five?

06:17.212 --> 06:18.344
Okay.

06:18.346 --> 06:21.014
Merry Christmas.

06:21.016 --> 06:24.150
And a convivial Tuesday
in April to you too, Pool!

06:24.152 --> 06:27.720

I wanna shoop, baby</i>

06:27.722 --> 06:30.690

Oh, hello. I know, right?

06:48.777 --> 06:50.743
Whose balls
did I have to fondle

06:50.745 --> 06:52.378
to get my very own movie?

06:52.380 --> 06:53.780
I can't tell you,

06:53.782 --> 06:56.249
but it does rhyme
with "Polverine."

06:56.251 --> 06:59.102
And let me tell you,

06:59.103 --> 07:01.954
he's got a nice pair of
smooth criminals down under.

07:01.956 --> 07:06.125
Anyway, I got places to be,
a face to fix and, oh...

07:06.127 --> 07:08.928
Bad guys to kill.

07:14.202 --> 07:15.268
Maximum effort.

07:25.313 --> 07:26.379
Cock shot.

07:31.319 --> 07:32.418
Ha!

07:34.122 --> 07:36.255
Rich Corinthian leather.

07:38.159 --> 07:40.460
I'm looking for Francis!

07:40.462 --> 07:42.261
Have you seen this man?

07:42.263 --> 07:44.330
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

07:50.472 --> 07:52.171
Ow. Ow!

07:52.173 --> 07:53.272
Yanky, yanky!

08:26.474 --> 08:28.274
I've never said this,
but don't swallow.

08:49.397 --> 08:51.497
Shit.

08:51.499 --> 08:53.566
Did I leave the stove on?

09:11.085 --> 09:12.885
<i>Now, breaking news.</i>

09:12.887 --> 09:14.954
<i>A multi-car collision
turned shots fired</i>

09:14.956 --> 09:16.856
<i>on the crosstown expressway
this morning.</i>

09:16.858 --> 09:19.091
<i>Gridlock has kept
police from the scene.</i>

09:19.093 --> 09:21.561
<i>Residents are advised
to remain in their homes.</i>

09:21.563 --> 09:23.229
<i>The assailant
appears to be armed,</i>

09:23.231 --> 09:24.831
<i>dangerous, and wearing...</i>

09:24.833 --> 09:26.265
<i>a red suit.</i>
A red suit.

09:26.935 --> 09:28.167
Deadpool.

09:28.169 --> 09:31.838
Negasonic!
Come, we have mission.

09:31.840 --> 09:34.273
Colossus, wait up.

09:34.275 --> 09:37.610
I've given Deadpool
every chance to join us...

09:37.612 --> 09:39.979
but he'd rather
act like a child.

09:39.981 --> 09:42.348
A heavily-armed child.

09:42.350 --> 09:46.252
When will he grow up and see
benefits of becoming X-Man?

09:46.254 --> 09:48.387
Which benefits?
The matching unitards?

09:48.389 --> 09:50.289
The house that blows up
every few years?

09:50.291 --> 09:51.390
Please.

09:51.392 --> 09:54.293
House blowing up
builds character.

09:54.295 --> 09:56.229
You ate breakfast, yes?

09:56.231 --> 09:59.365
Breakfast is most
important meal of day.

09:59.367 --> 10:03.636
Here, protein bar.
Good for bones.

10:03.638 --> 10:06.305
Deadpool may try
to break yours.

10:14.649 --> 10:16.115
Get out of the way!

10:33.401 --> 10:35.034
Hey! Whoo!

10:46.114 --> 10:47.613
Wait!

10:47.615 --> 10:49.916
You may be wondering,
"Why the red suit?"

10:49.918 --> 10:51.951
Well, that's so bad guys
can't see me bleed.

10:52.987 --> 10:54.420
This guy's got the right idea.

10:54.422 --> 10:55.955
He wore the brown pants.

10:57.659 --> 11:00.026
Fine!
I only have 12 bullets...

11:00.028 --> 11:01.594
so you're gonna
have to share!

11:01.596 --> 11:03.496
Let's count them down.

11:22.717 --> 11:24.083
Shit.

11:27.021 --> 11:28.688
Motherfucker!

11:30.058 --> 11:31.190
10! Shit!

11:31.659 --> 11:32.725
Nine. Fuck.

11:33.194 --> 11:34.327
Eight.

11:34.329 --> 11:35.394
Shit-fuck!

11:39.133 --> 11:40.366
Bad Deadpool.

11:41.669 --> 11:44.070
Seven.
Good Deadpool.

11:56.751 --> 11:58.017
Oh!

12:07.494 --> 12:08.934
Someone's not counting. Six.

12:28.416 --> 12:30.016
Oh!

12:35.323 --> 12:37.256
Four...

12:38.760 --> 12:40.159
Gotcha.

12:41.596 --> 12:43.095
Right up main street.

12:47.068 --> 12:48.134
Three, two!

12:48.136 --> 12:50.102
Stupid! Worth it.

13:14.095 --> 13:15.294
Ah!

13:16.397 --> 13:18.431
I'm touching myself tonight.

13:19.233 --> 13:20.633
Francis!

13:20.635 --> 13:22.101
Francis...

13:23.805 --> 13:26.238
What the shit-biscuit!

13:26.240 --> 13:28.074
Where you at,
Francis?

13:36.784 --> 13:38.084
You're not Francis.

13:45.860 --> 13:48.461
Really?
Rolling up the sleeves?

13:58.706 --> 14:00.272
<i>You're
probably thinking,</i>

14:00.274 --> 14:02.208
<i>"My boyfriend said
this was a superhero movie...</i>

14:02.210 --> 14:03.676
<i>"but that guy in the red suit
just turned</i>

14:03.678 --> 14:06.212
<i>"that other guy
into a fucking kabab!"</i>

14:06.214 --> 14:10.783
<i>Well, I may be super,
but I'm no hero.</i>

14:10.785 --> 14:13.152
<i>And yeah, technically,
this is a murder.</i>

14:13.154 --> 14:15.421
<i>But some of the best love
stories start with a murder.</i>

14:15.423 --> 14:18.491
<i>And that's exactly
what this is, a love story.</i>

14:18.493 --> 14:19.859
<i>And to tell it right...</i>

14:19.861 --> 14:22.261
<i>I gotta take you back
to long before</i>

14:22.263 --> 14:25.698
<i>I squeezed this ass
into red spandex.</i>

14:25.700 --> 14:28.434
Look, would it help
if I slow it down for you?

14:28.436 --> 14:30.803
I didn't order the pizza.

14:30.805 --> 14:34.740
Is this 7348 Red Ledge Drive?
Are you Mr. Merchant?

14:34.742 --> 14:38.244
Yeah, the Mr. Merchant who
didn't order the fucking pie!

14:38.246 --> 14:39.411
Then who placed the call?

14:39.847 --> 14:41.380
I did!

14:43.551 --> 14:45.484
Pineapple and olive?

14:45.486 --> 14:48.454
Sweet and salty.

14:48.456 --> 14:49.622
The fuck are you?

14:49.624 --> 14:51.624
The fuck you doing
in my crib...

14:51.626 --> 14:52.791
Is it burnt crust?

14:52.793 --> 14:54.727
I... God,
I hope not. Um...

14:54.729 --> 14:56.662
Whoa... Man, look,
if this is about that poker game.

14:56.664 --> 14:58.931
I told Howie,
I told him that...

14:58.933 --> 15:02.935
Okay, uh, look,
just take whatever you want.

15:02.937 --> 15:05.171
Thanks.

15:05.173 --> 15:06.472
Sir, before you do
anything to him,

15:06.474 --> 15:08.207
do you mind
if I get a big tip?

15:08.209 --> 15:10.943
Uh, Jeremy, is it?

15:10.945 --> 15:12.578
Umm-hmm.
Wade. Wade Wilson.

15:13.648 --> 15:16.682
That is a no go
on the tiperoo, Jer.

15:16.684 --> 15:18.551
I'm not here for him.

15:18.553 --> 15:20.286
I'm here for you.

15:20.288 --> 15:21.820
Oh.

15:21.822 --> 15:23.589
Okay, wow, dodged
a big-time bullet on that one.

15:23.591 --> 15:26.292
Not out of the woods yet.

15:26.294 --> 15:28.627
You need to seriously ease up
on the bedazzling.

15:28.629 --> 15:30.629
They're jeans,
not a chandelier.

15:30.631 --> 15:32.865
P.S. I'm keeping your wallet.
You did kinda give it to me.

15:32.867 --> 15:34.767
Okay, just look, man,
can I have my Sam's card...

15:34.769 --> 15:37.836
I will shoot your fucking cat!

15:37.838 --> 15:40.639
I don't really know what that means.
I don't have a cat.

15:40.641 --> 15:42.508
Then whose kitty litter
did I just shit in?

15:46.547 --> 15:48.714
Anyhoo, tell me something...

15:48.716 --> 15:52.551
what situation
isn't improved by pizza?

15:52.553 --> 15:54.853
Do you happen to know
a Meghan Orflosky?

15:54.855 --> 15:56.589
Getting that right?
Orflosky?

15:56.591 --> 15:58.891
Orlovsky? Yeah? Good.

16:00.228 --> 16:01.493
Because she knows you.

16:01.495 --> 16:03.729
Jeremy, I belong
to a group of guys

16:03.731 --> 16:05.864
who take a dime
to beat a fella down.

16:05.866 --> 16:07.433
And little Meghan,
she's not made of money,

16:07.435 --> 16:08.734
but lucky for her...

16:08.736 --> 16:10.769
I got a soft spot.

16:10.771 --> 16:13.272
But I'm a...
A stalker.

16:13.274 --> 16:14.740
Threats hurt, Jer.

16:14.742 --> 16:18.410
Though not nearly as badly
as serrated steel.

16:18.412 --> 16:21.513
So keep away
from Meghan.

16:21.515 --> 16:22.581
Cool?

16:22.583 --> 16:23.749
Yes, sir.

16:23.751 --> 16:25.251
Then we're done.

16:25.253 --> 16:27.353
Wait.
We are?

16:27.355 --> 16:29.622
Yeah. We're totally done.

16:29.624 --> 16:31.257
You should've
seen your face.

16:31.259 --> 16:32.691
I didn't know what to do.
I was so scared.

16:32.693 --> 16:33.826
Soft spot, remember?

16:35.363 --> 16:37.463
You even look in her
general direction again...

16:37.465 --> 16:38.964
and you will learn
in the worst of ways

16:38.966 --> 16:41.300
that I have
some hard spots too.

16:43.037 --> 16:44.603
That came out wrong.

16:45.640 --> 16:46.872
Or did it?

16:59.520 --> 17:01.020
Mmm... Meghan?

17:04.291 --> 17:06.012
You've heard the last
of Jeremy. He's sorry.

17:06.527 --> 17:08.460
No friggin' way.

17:13.300 --> 17:14.433
Should've brought
my roller blades.

17:14.435 --> 17:15.867
Show these kids
how it's done.

17:15.869 --> 17:19.471
Oh. And that's why we do it.
But mostly the money.

17:19.473 --> 17:21.440
Hey, think you could
fuck up my step-dad?

17:21.442 --> 17:22.941
I give a guy
a pavement facial,

17:22.943 --> 17:24.063
it's because he's earned it.

17:24.679 --> 17:25.978
Hey, wait!

17:27.647 --> 17:28.914
You're my hero.

17:28.916 --> 17:31.583
No-no-no-no.
That I ain't!

17:33.087 --> 17:35.688
<i>Nope. Never will be.</i>

17:35.690 --> 17:37.690
Oh. Fuck you, Wade.

17:37.692 --> 17:41.360
<i>I'm just a bad guy who gets
paid to fuck up worse guys.</i>

17:42.596 --> 17:44.563
<i>Welcome to Sister Margaret's.</i>

17:44.565 --> 17:47.533
<i>It's like a job fair
for mercenaries.</i>

17:47.535 --> 17:49.468
<i>Think of us as really
fucked up tooth fairies...</i>

17:49.470 --> 17:52.037
<i>except we knock out the teeth
and take the cash.</i>

17:52.039 --> 17:55.107
<i>You'd best hope we never see
your name on a gold card.</i>

17:55.109 --> 17:57.476
Buck! Liefeld...

17:57.478 --> 17:58.744
Hey, Wade!

17:58.746 --> 17:59.978
Wade Wilson,
patron saint of the pitiful.

17:59.980 --> 18:01.847
What can I do for you?

18:01.849 --> 18:03.482
I'd love a Blow Job.

18:03.484 --> 18:04.683
Oh, God, me too.

18:04.685 --> 18:06.819
The drink, moose knuckle.
But first...

18:08.489 --> 18:10.522
Hey, and I ain't taking
any babysitting money, all right?

18:10.524 --> 18:12.091
Make sure
that gets back to Ms...

18:12.093 --> 18:13.392
Orlovsky.

18:13.394 --> 18:14.460
Yeah, her.

18:14.462 --> 18:15.894
You sure?
Hmm.

18:15.896 --> 18:18.464
You know, for a merc,
you're pretty warm-blooded.

18:18.466 --> 18:20.432
I bet you let
the kid off easy, too.

18:20.434 --> 18:22.401
Oh, he's not a bad kid, Weas.

18:22.403 --> 18:23.635
Just a little light stalking.

18:23.637 --> 18:25.371
I was way worse than him
when I was his age.

18:25.373 --> 18:27.005
I was traveling
to exotic places...

18:27.007 --> 18:29.775
Baghdad, Mogadishu,
Jacksonville,

18:29.777 --> 18:31.677
meeting new and exciting
people. And then, uh...

18:31.679 --> 18:33.879
Killing them. Yeah,
I've seen your Instagram.

18:33.881 --> 18:36.415
So what was Special Forces doing
in Jacksonville, anyway?

18:36.417 --> 18:37.916
That's classified.

18:37.918 --> 18:40.152
They have
a wonderful TGI Fridays.

18:40.154 --> 18:42.654
All right,
Kahlua, Baileys and...

18:42.656 --> 18:43.922
whipped cream.

18:43.924 --> 18:46.558
I give you a Blow Job.

18:46.560 --> 18:47.926
Why do you
make me make that?

18:47.928 --> 18:49.795
Kelly, Kelly, Kelly...

18:49.797 --> 18:51.397
Take that over
to Buck please,

18:51.399 --> 18:53.165
and tell him it's from Boothe.
Little foreplay.

18:53.167 --> 18:55.634
Remind me what good
will come of this?

18:55.636 --> 18:57.703
I don't take the shits.
I just disturb them.

18:57.705 --> 18:59.004
Boothe!
Oh!

18:59.006 --> 19:00.406
Easy, man.
Hold up! Hold up!

19:00.408 --> 19:01.473
What you want?

19:04.078 --> 19:06.879
- Cheers. To your health.
- Fuck you.

19:06.881 --> 19:09.047
Come here,
you fat fuck!

19:09.049 --> 19:10.749
That's a new stool.

19:15.523 --> 19:16.955
Stay the fuck down.

19:19.627 --> 19:21.427
Whoa! Took his ass out!

19:21.429 --> 19:23.095
All right, move.
Move, move, move.

19:23.097 --> 19:24.463
Buck, go rest.

19:25.699 --> 19:27.059
Boothe got hit
then went down.

19:30.738 --> 19:33.472
Yeah, he's still breathing.

19:36.010 --> 19:37.643
Nobody wins today.

19:37.645 --> 19:39.445
Nice try, Wade.

19:39.447 --> 19:41.580
You got me.
I picked Boothe in the dead pool.

19:41.582 --> 19:42.948
Who did you pick?

19:42.950 --> 19:45.150
Yeah, Wade,
about that, um...

19:45.152 --> 19:46.685
No.

19:46.687 --> 19:48.620
You did not bet
on me to die.

19:51.992 --> 19:53.592
You bet on me to die. Wow!

19:53.594 --> 19:55.461
Motherfucker, you're
the world's worst friend.

19:55.463 --> 19:57.696
Well, joke's on you.
I'm living to 102.

19:57.698 --> 19:59.832
And then dying.
Like the city of Detroit.

19:59.834 --> 20:02.835
I'm sorry. I just...
I wanted to win money.

20:02.837 --> 20:04.136
I never win anything.

20:04.138 --> 20:05.237
Whatever.

20:05.239 --> 20:06.972
Soldiers of fortune,
drinks on me!

20:09.477 --> 20:11.243
Domestic, nothing imported.

20:14.014 --> 20:15.647
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa...

20:15.649 --> 20:19.218
Baby, are you sure you wanna
shoot your whole wad?

20:19.753 --> 20:22.621
Uh... Tight.

20:24.091 --> 20:26.525
Vanessa.
Wade.

20:26.527 --> 20:28.727
What's a nice place like you
doing in a girl like this?

20:29.964 --> 20:31.230
I'd hit that.

20:32.600 --> 20:34.500
Buck, you best
apologize before...

20:34.502 --> 20:36.902
Yeah, that.

20:36.904 --> 20:38.670
Say the magic words,
Fat Gandalf.

20:38.672 --> 20:40.506
I'm sorry.
Breathe through the nose.

20:40.508 --> 20:42.774
I don't have a filter
between my brain and my...

20:42.776 --> 20:44.776
Let go. Okay.
Hey, oh, oh, oh...

20:44.778 --> 20:45.878
Hakuna his tatas.
He's sorry.

20:45.880 --> 20:47.212
I'm working on it.

20:47.214 --> 20:49.848
Get out of here.
Go. Go cast a spell.

20:49.850 --> 20:52.251
Hey. Hands off
the merchandise.

20:53.821 --> 20:55.254
Merchandise? Huh...

20:55.256 --> 20:57.856
So you, uh...

20:57.858 --> 20:59.224
bump fuzzies for money?

20:59.226 --> 21:01.293
Yep.
Rough childhood?

21:01.295 --> 21:02.561
Rougher than yours.

21:02.563 --> 21:04.730
Daddy left before
I was born.

21:04.732 --> 21:06.231
Daddy left before
I was conceived.

21:07.535 --> 21:09.101
Ever had a cigarette
put out on your skin?

21:09.103 --> 21:10.602
Where else do you
put one out?

21:10.604 --> 21:11.870
I was molested.

21:11.872 --> 21:13.672
Me too. Uncle.

21:13.674 --> 21:16.141
Uncles. They took turns.

21:16.143 --> 21:17.676
I watched my own
birthday party

21:17.678 --> 21:18.877
through the keyhole
of a locked closet...

21:18.879 --> 21:20.279
which also happens to be my...

21:20.281 --> 21:23.148
Your bedroom. Lucky.
I slept in a dishwasher box.

21:23.150 --> 21:25.751
You had a dishwasher.

21:25.753 --> 21:26.852
I didn't even know sleep.

21:26.854 --> 21:28.787
It was pretty much
24/7 ball gags,

21:28.789 --> 21:30.255
brownie mix and clown porn.

21:34.161 --> 21:35.627
Who would do such a thing?

21:37.097 --> 21:40.732
Hopefully you, later tonight?

21:43.337 --> 21:48.340
Hey, what can I get for,
uh, $275 and a...

21:49.643 --> 21:51.243
a Yogurtland rewards card?

21:51.245 --> 21:54.012
Baby, about 48 minutes of
whatever the fuck you want.

21:55.316 --> 21:57.182
And a low-fat dessert.

22:04.124 --> 22:06.625
Did she just put a gift card
in your mouth?

22:07.795 --> 22:09.928
It's time to put
balls in holes.

22:10.898 --> 22:12.598
You said whatever I want.

22:13.100 --> 22:14.600
I get it.

22:14.602 --> 22:16.101
You love skee ball.

22:16.103 --> 22:18.370
Apparently more than
you love vagina.

22:18.372 --> 22:20.839
That's a tough call.

22:20.841 --> 22:23.108
I just wanna get to
know the real you, you know.

22:23.110 --> 22:25.110
Not the short-shorted,
two-dimensional

22:25.112 --> 22:27.079
sex object
peddled by Hollywood.

22:27.081 --> 22:28.146
Balls in holes.

22:29.216 --> 22:30.282
Balls in holes.

22:30.284 --> 22:31.917
Prepare to lose tragically.

22:31.919 --> 22:33.051
Bring it, big man.

22:33.053 --> 22:34.119
Okay.

22:36.390 --> 22:37.756
Uh-oh.

22:38.158 --> 22:39.224
Uh-oh.

22:40.327 --> 22:41.927
The limited edition

22:41.929 --> 22:45.197
Voltron: Defender of
the Universe ring, <i>por favor.</i>

22:45.199 --> 22:48.767
Okay. Here we go.

22:48.769 --> 22:50.902
Had my eye on
this sucker for a while.

22:50.904 --> 22:52.838
And I will take
the pencil eraser.

22:52.840 --> 22:54.239
Okay.

22:54.241 --> 22:57.142
You are now the protector
of the planet Arus.

22:57.144 --> 22:59.144
And you can erase stuff...

22:59.146 --> 23:00.912
written in pencil.

23:00.914 --> 23:02.280
M'lady?

23:02.282 --> 23:03.749
Well, I hate to
break it to you...

23:03.751 --> 23:06.018
but your 48 minutes
are up.

23:06.020 --> 23:08.920
Hey, how many more minutes
can I get for this?

23:08.922 --> 23:11.356
FYI, five mini lion-bots
come together

23:11.358 --> 23:13.792
to form one super-bot, so...

23:13.794 --> 23:16.895
Five mini lion-bots?
Three minutes.

23:16.897 --> 23:18.564
Deal.

23:18.565 --> 23:20.805
What do we do with the remaining
two minutes, 37 seconds?

23:21.035 --> 23:22.100
Cuddle?

23:26.340 --> 23:28.106
How long can you
keep this up?

23:28.108 --> 23:29.441
All year?

23:39.920 --> 23:41.853
Happy Valentine's Day.

23:49.329 --> 23:51.063
Happy Chinese New Year.

23:51.065 --> 23:52.397
Year of the Dog.

23:57.471 --> 23:59.271
Relax.

23:59.273 --> 24:01.440
And Happy
International Women's Day.

24:05.979 --> 24:09.147
No. No. No.

24:11.385 --> 24:12.751
Happy Lent.

24:16.490 --> 24:17.889
Ow, ow.

24:17.891 --> 24:19.157
Wade?
Sorry.

24:19.159 --> 24:20.759
Happy Halloween.

24:20.761 --> 24:21.893
Happy Halloween.

24:31.438 --> 24:33.305
Happy Thanksgiving.

24:35.242 --> 24:36.242
I love you.

24:40.247 --> 24:42.314
If your left leg
is Thanksgiving...

24:42.316 --> 24:44.116
and your right leg
is Christmas...

24:45.319 --> 24:46.985
can I visit you
between the holidays?

24:47.788 --> 24:48.887
Oh!

24:48.889 --> 24:50.789
That sweater is terrible.

24:51.892 --> 24:53.325
But red looks good on you.

24:53.327 --> 24:54.760
Red's your color.

24:54.762 --> 24:56.294
Brings out the bloodshot
in your eyes.

24:57.197 --> 24:58.296
Listen,
I've been thinking...

24:58.298 --> 25:00.132
Really?

25:00.134 --> 25:02.200
...about why we're
so good together.

25:02.202 --> 25:04.136
Why's that?

25:04.138 --> 25:08.140
Well, your crazy matches
my crazy. Big time.

25:08.142 --> 25:10.075
Hmm.

25:10.077 --> 25:11.810
And, uh, we're like
two jigsaw pieces,

25:11.812 --> 25:13.411
you know,
the weird curvy edges...

25:13.413 --> 25:15.881
You put them together and you
can see the picture on top.

25:16.483 --> 25:17.816
Right.

25:18.218 --> 25:20.051
Wade...

25:20.053 --> 25:22.487
there's something I've been
meaning to ask you.

25:22.489 --> 25:25.157
But only because you haven't
gotten around to asking me.

25:27.227 --> 25:28.360
Will you, uh...

25:29.463 --> 25:31.429
stick it in my...
Marry me?

25:33.167 --> 25:35.433
Uh... Jinx?

25:35.435 --> 25:37.302
Huh.

25:37.304 --> 25:38.470
Where were you
hiding that?

25:38.472 --> 25:40.505
Nowhere.

25:40.507 --> 25:42.307
They say one month's salary.
So, uh...

25:42.309 --> 25:43.341
You mean?

25:43.343 --> 25:44.409
I do.

25:44.411 --> 25:45.477
That's my line.

25:48.916 --> 25:51.316
I love you, Wade Wilson.

25:51.318 --> 25:52.818
You're supposed to...
So that's a...

25:52.820 --> 25:54.252
Yes!
Whoo!

25:54.988 --> 25:56.121
Yes!

25:58.192 --> 26:00.058
I feel just like
a little girl.

26:04.998 --> 26:07.332
What if I just held on
and never let go?

26:07.334 --> 26:10.068
Just ride a bitch's back,
like Yoda on Luke.

26:10.070 --> 26:12.404
Oh, <i>Star Wars</i> jokes.

26:12.940 --> 26:14.172
<i>Empire.</i>

26:15.475 --> 26:16.942
Jesus Christ.

26:16.944 --> 26:18.944
It's like I made you
in a computer.

26:20.514 --> 26:21.580
Mmm.

26:23.083 --> 26:24.149
Hey.

26:25.152 --> 26:26.551
Perfect.

26:30.290 --> 26:31.957
Let's see.
All right, wee break.

26:31.959 --> 26:33.225
Shake it, yeah.

26:39.366 --> 26:40.999
<i>Here's the thing.</i>

26:41.001 --> 26:42.968
<i>Life is an endless series
of train-wrecks...</i>

26:42.970 --> 26:47.372
<i>with only brief,
commercial-like breaks of happiness.</i>

26:47.374 --> 26:50.175
<i>This had been the ultimate
commercial break.</i>

26:52.512 --> 26:54.012
<i>Which meant
it was time to return</i>

26:54.014 --> 26:55.914
<i>to our regularly
scheduled program.</i>

26:55.916 --> 26:57.649
What the...

26:57.651 --> 26:58.984
Oh, my God. Wade?

27:05.158 --> 27:06.992
You're clowning.

27:06.994 --> 27:08.593
You're not clowning?

27:08.595 --> 27:11.046
I sense clowns.

27:11.047 --> 27:13.498
People react to news of
late-stage cancer differently.

27:13.500 --> 27:16.401
There are certainly options
we can look into.

27:16.403 --> 27:18.270
New drugs are being
developed every day.

27:22.676 --> 27:24.342
So what do we do?

27:24.344 --> 27:27.946
Surely there is
something we can do.

27:27.948 --> 27:30.482
My uncle Ivan was diagnosed
with thyroid cancer...

27:30.484 --> 27:33.084
and there were all these new
experimental drugs from Germany.

27:33.086 --> 27:35.587
<i>Vanessa's already
working on Plan A, B,</i>

27:35.589 --> 27:37.589
<i>all the way through Z.</i>

27:37.591 --> 27:41.960
<i>Me? I'm memorizing
the details of her face.</i>

27:41.962 --> 27:44.329
<i>Like it's the first time
I'm seeing it.</i>

27:44.331 --> 27:45.463
<i>Or the last.</i>

27:45.465 --> 27:47.132
Mr. Wilson...

27:47.134 --> 27:48.967
Mr. Wilson?

27:48.969 --> 27:52.237
Take your time
to process this.

27:52.239 --> 27:54.239
<i>It's important not to
do anything rash.</i>

28:05.619 --> 28:08.386
Now, if I were
a 200-pound sack

28:08.388 --> 28:11.056
of assholes named Francis,
where would I hide?

28:14.728 --> 28:15.994
Oh.

28:36.416 --> 28:38.350
A hush falls
over the crowd

28:38.352 --> 28:40.652
as rookie sensation
Wade W. Wilson...

28:40.654 --> 28:44.289
out of Regina, Saskatchewan,
lines up the shot.

28:46.093 --> 28:47.692
His form looks good.

28:48.528 --> 28:49.694
Oh!

28:49.696 --> 28:54.232
And that's why Regina
rhymes with fun.

28:54.234 --> 28:56.534
Ladies and gentlemen,
what you're witnessing...

28:56.536 --> 28:59.004
is sweet dick-kicking revenge.

28:59.773 --> 29:01.673
Oh! Giving him the business.

29:01.675 --> 29:04.009
Incoming!

29:04.011 --> 29:07.679
This is taking unsportsmanlike
conduct to a whole new level!

29:13.120 --> 29:15.120
Looking good, Francis.
Well rested.

29:15.122 --> 29:17.288
Like you've been pitching,
not catching.

29:17.290 --> 29:19.324
Ringing any bells? No?

29:24.264 --> 29:25.497
How about now?

29:29.436 --> 29:31.636
Wade fucking Wilson.

29:34.174 --> 29:36.324
Well,
hello, gorgeous.

29:36.325 --> 29:38.475
Yeah, like I got bit
by a radioactive Shar-Pei.

29:38.478 --> 29:41.679
Yeah. And whose fault
is that, huh, Francis?

29:41.681 --> 29:43.715
Yeah, time to undo what
you did to this butterface.

29:43.717 --> 29:45.550
Please,
you should thank me.

29:45.552 --> 29:47.185
Apparently,
I made you immortal.

29:47.187 --> 29:48.720
I'm actually
quite jealous.

29:48.722 --> 29:51.222
Yeah, but this ain't
a life worth living, is it?

29:53.193 --> 29:54.826
Now, I'm about
to do to you

29:54.828 --> 29:57.362
what Limp Bizkit did to
music in the late 90s.

29:59.433 --> 30:00.498
Dad?

30:03.837 --> 30:06.604
<i>I think we can all agree
that shit just went sideways</i>

30:06.606 --> 30:08.540
<i>in the most colossal way.</i>

30:09.509 --> 30:12.077
<i>Well, maybe not the most.</i>

30:12.079 --> 30:15.780
Uh... This is
my most prized possession.

30:16.349 --> 30:17.449
Wham?

30:17.451 --> 30:19.717
No, no, no. Wham!

30:19.719 --> 30:23.321
<i>Make It Big</i> is the album that George
and Andy earned the exclamation point.

30:24.324 --> 30:25.857
So, am I supposed
to just smile

30:25.859 --> 30:27.325
and wave you out the door?

30:27.327 --> 30:28.726
Think of it like
spring cleaning.

30:28.728 --> 30:30.261
Only if spring
was death.

30:30.263 --> 30:32.630
God, if I had a nickel
for every time

30:32.632 --> 30:35.233
I spanked it to
Bernadette Peters.

30:35.235 --> 30:37.469
Sounds like you do.

30:37.471 --> 30:39.404
Bernadette is not
going anywhere,

30:39.406 --> 30:41.406
because you're not
going anywhere.

30:41.408 --> 30:42.707
Drink.

30:42.709 --> 30:44.109
You're right.
Cancer is only in my liver,

30:44.111 --> 30:45.410
lungs, prostate, and brain.

30:45.412 --> 30:46.644
All things I can
live without.

30:47.747 --> 30:48.847
Ha.

30:48.849 --> 30:50.882
You belong here
at home.

30:50.884 --> 30:52.517
Surrounded by
your Voltron

30:52.519 --> 30:54.652
and your Bernadette,
and your me.

30:55.856 --> 30:59.491
Listen, we both know
that cancer is a shit-show.

31:01.161 --> 31:03.294
Like, a Yakov-Smirnoff-
opening-for-the

31:03.296 --> 31:06.164
Spin-Doctors-at-the-
Iowa-State-Fair shit-show.

31:08.168 --> 31:12.704
And under no circumstances
will I take you to that show.

31:13.907 --> 31:15.707
I want you to remember me.

31:17.244 --> 31:19.144
Not the ghost
of Christmas me.

31:19.146 --> 31:21.379
Well, I wanna remember us.

31:21.381 --> 31:23.815
I swear to God, I will
find you in the next life...

31:23.816 --> 31:26.250
and I'm gonna boom-box
<i>Careless Whisper</i> outside your window.

31:26.253 --> 31:27.652
Wham!

31:30.924 --> 31:34.192
No one is boom-boxing shit.
Okay?

31:36.596 --> 31:38.196
We can fight this.

31:41.268 --> 31:44.269
Besides, I just
realized something.

31:44.271 --> 31:46.604
You win.
Your life is officially

31:46.606 --> 31:49.407
way more fucked up
than mine.

31:53.680 --> 31:54.746
I love you.

32:06.426 --> 32:07.625
Wade.

32:09.696 --> 32:11.262
Weas.

32:11.264 --> 32:13.565
You look like you need
a Blow Job and a shower.

32:13.567 --> 32:15.700
Though courtesy calls
for the latter first.

32:15.702 --> 32:17.468
How about three shots
of Patron?

32:17.470 --> 32:21.306
Or how about <i>Triticum aestivum,</i>
wheatgrass.

32:21.308 --> 32:22.640
Excellent for
the immune system.

32:22.642 --> 32:24.742
Jesus Christ.
You sound like Vanessa.

32:24.744 --> 32:27.128
Here, check it out.

32:27.129 --> 32:29.513
She's sending away for all these
colorful clinic brochures.

32:29.516 --> 32:31.716
I'm sure they're
all FDA approved.

32:31.718 --> 32:34.719
Chechnya. Isn't that where
you go to get cancer?

32:34.721 --> 32:37.855
You got China
and Central Mexico.

32:37.857 --> 32:40.325
You know how they
say "cancer" in Spanish?

32:40.327 --> 32:41.859
No.

32:41.861 --> 32:43.595
<i>El Cancer.</i>
Oh.

32:43.597 --> 32:45.863
I could have
guessed that.

32:45.865 --> 32:47.432
Look how happy
you look here.

32:47.434 --> 32:49.000
Mind if I keep this?
Put it up,

32:49.002 --> 32:51.903
so I can remember
when you looked alive.

32:51.905 --> 32:53.905
At least now I'm gonna
win the dead pool.

32:53.907 --> 32:56.708
Now that you're gonna die
tragically of cancer.

32:56.710 --> 32:58.610
I got it, Weas. Thanks.

32:58.612 --> 33:01.012
Oh.

33:01.014 --> 33:03.715
And, uh, that guy over there
came in looking for you.

33:03.717 --> 33:06.651
Real Grim Reaper type.

33:06.653 --> 33:08.686
I don't know.
Might further the plot.

33:12.692 --> 33:13.791
Boothe.

33:13.793 --> 33:14.959
Wade.

33:20.267 --> 33:21.699
Mr. Wilson.

33:21.701 --> 33:22.900
How can I help you?

33:22.902 --> 33:25.670
Besides luring children
into a panel van.

33:25.672 --> 33:29.440
I understand you've recently
been diagnosed with terminal cancer.

33:29.442 --> 33:30.608
Stalker alert.

33:30.610 --> 33:33.511
It's my job.
Recruitment.

33:33.513 --> 33:36.948
I'm sorry you've had
such a tough go.

33:36.950 --> 33:39.417
But you're a fighter.
Special Forces.

33:39.419 --> 33:42.320
41 confirmed kills.

33:42.322 --> 33:43.688
One every seven weeks.

33:43.690 --> 33:46.724
Same rate most folks
get a haircut. Hmm...

33:46.726 --> 33:47.992
It's to wash
the taste out.

33:47.994 --> 33:51.562
It's tough to forget
being so impressive.

33:51.564 --> 33:53.598
And now you
spend your days

33:53.600 --> 33:55.600
sticking up for
the little people...

33:55.602 --> 33:57.602
People change.
What do you want?

33:57.604 --> 34:00.738
I represent an organization
that may be able to help.

34:02.609 --> 34:06.844
What if I told you
we can cure your cancer?

34:06.846 --> 34:11.014
And what's more, give you abilities
most men only dream of?

34:14.688 --> 34:16.587
I'd say that you sound
like an infomercial,

34:16.589 --> 34:18.755
but not a good one,
like Slap Chop.

34:18.757 --> 34:20.491
More Shake Weight-y.

34:20.493 --> 34:23.561
The world needs
extraordinary soldiers.

34:23.563 --> 34:25.697
We won't just
make you better.

34:25.699 --> 34:28.766
We will make you
better than better.

34:29.703 --> 34:31.369
A superhero.

34:31.371 --> 34:34.105
Look, Agent Smith,

34:34.107 --> 34:36.741
I tried the hero business
and it left a mark.

34:36.743 --> 34:39.510
But if I ever hit "fuck it,"
I'll look you up.

34:40.013 --> 34:41.779
Oh, um...

34:41.781 --> 34:43.481
Shit. We're within
500 yards of a school,

34:43.483 --> 34:44.716
so you may wanna...

34:49.656 --> 34:50.922
His drink's on him.

34:56.596 --> 34:58.429
What did he say?

35:20.887 --> 35:22.620
Hey, what's going on?

35:22.622 --> 35:25.022
Hey. Sorry.

35:26.526 --> 35:29.427
I had a Liam Neeson
nightmare.

35:29.429 --> 35:30.895
I dreamt I kidnapped
his daughter

35:30.897 --> 35:32.630
and he just
wasn't having it.

35:40.173 --> 35:45.510
Hey, uh, they've made
three of those movies.

35:45.512 --> 35:48.713
At some point you have
to wonder if he's just a bad parent.

35:48.715 --> 35:49.781
Hmm.

36:02.962 --> 36:06.964
<i>The worst part about cancer
isn't what it does to you...</i>

36:06.966 --> 36:10.101
<i>but what it does to
the people you love.</i>

36:10.103 --> 36:12.804
<i>Who knew if this guy
could save my life...</i>

36:12.806 --> 36:15.940
<i>but I knew there was only one
way that I could save hers.</i>

36:19.679 --> 36:21.946
<i>Isn't that what
superheroes do?</i>

36:34.160 --> 36:38.496
<i>Okay. Let's pro-con
this superhero thing.</i>

36:38.965 --> 36:40.164
Ow.

36:40.166 --> 36:43.134
<i>Pro: They pull down
a gaggle of ass.</i>

36:43.136 --> 36:44.702
<i>Local dry cleaning discounts.</i>

36:44.704 --> 36:46.571
<i>Lucrative film deals,
both origin stories</i>

36:46.573 --> 36:48.739
<i>and larger ensemble
team movies.</i>

36:48.741 --> 36:51.843
Con: They're all lame-ass
teacher's pets.

36:51.845 --> 36:53.711
You know,
I can hear you.

36:53.713 --> 36:56.681
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to them.

36:56.683 --> 36:58.983
Stay right here.

36:58.985 --> 37:01.252
You've been
warned before, Deadpool.

37:01.254 --> 37:04.989
This is a shameful and
reckless use of your powers.

37:04.991 --> 37:07.124
You will both
be coming with us.

37:07.126 --> 37:09.060
Look, Colossus,
I don't have time for

37:09.062 --> 37:11.162
the goody two-shoes
bullshit right now!

37:11.164 --> 37:13.097
And you are?

37:14.734 --> 37:16.634
Negasonic Teenage Warhead.

37:16.636 --> 37:20.037
Negasonic Teenage...
What the shit?

37:20.039 --> 37:21.939
That's the coolest name ever!

37:23.276 --> 37:26.010
So, what, you're like,
uh, his sidekick?

37:26.012 --> 37:27.645
No. Trainee.

37:27.647 --> 37:29.046
Let me guess.

37:29.048 --> 37:31.682
X-Men left you behind
on what? Shit detail?

37:31.684 --> 37:33.434
What does that make you?

37:33.435 --> 37:35.185
Pretending you're not here,
Negasonic Teenage Warhead.

37:35.188 --> 37:36.654
Can we trade names?

37:36.656 --> 37:38.155
Can we go?

37:38.157 --> 37:40.691
Look!
I'm a teenage girl.

37:40.693 --> 37:42.894
I'd rather be
anywhere than here.

37:42.896 --> 37:45.096
I'm all about
long sullen silences...

37:45.098 --> 37:49.033
followed by mean comments,
followed by more silences.

37:49.035 --> 37:52.270
So what's it gonna be, huh?
Long sullen silence...

37:52.272 --> 37:54.972
or mean comment? Go on.

37:56.175 --> 37:57.542
You got me in a box here.

37:57.544 --> 37:58.643
Aha!

37:58.645 --> 38:00.645
We can't allow this,
Deadpool.

38:00.647 --> 38:02.046
Please, come quietly.

38:02.048 --> 38:04.315
You big chrome
cock-gobbler!

38:04.317 --> 38:05.767
That's not nice.

38:05.768 --> 38:07.218
You're really gonna
fuck this up for me?

38:07.220 --> 38:11.789
Trust me, that wheezing bag
of dick-tips has it coming.

38:11.791 --> 38:14.725
He's pure evil.

38:14.727 --> 38:18.029
Besides...
Nobody's getting hurt.

38:23.202 --> 38:25.603
That guy was already up there
when I got here.

38:25.605 --> 38:28.839
Wade, you are
better than this.

38:28.841 --> 38:31.208
Join us.
Use your powers for good.

38:31.210 --> 38:32.276
Heads up.

38:32.278 --> 38:33.744
Be a superhero.

38:33.746 --> 38:35.513
Listen!

38:35.514 --> 38:37.281
The day I decide to become a
crime-fighting shit-swizzler...

38:37.283 --> 38:40.685
who rooms with a bunch of other little
whiners at the Neverland mansion...

38:40.687 --> 38:45.623
of some creepy, old, bald,
Heaven's Gate-looking motherfucker...

38:45.625 --> 38:47.291
on that day...

38:47.293 --> 38:49.694
I'll send your shiny,
happy ass a friend request.

38:49.696 --> 38:52.163
But until then, I'mma do
what I came here to do.

38:52.165 --> 38:54.966
Either that or slap
the bitch outta you!

38:54.968 --> 38:56.233
Wade...
Hey.

38:56.235 --> 38:57.602
Zip it, Sinead!

38:57.604 --> 38:58.669
Hey, douche-pool!

38:58.671 --> 38:59.971
And I hope
you're watching...

39:04.711 --> 39:06.377
Quite unfortunate.

39:09.849 --> 39:12.183
That does it!

39:13.386 --> 39:14.852
Oh!

39:14.854 --> 39:17.922
Canada!

39:19.058 --> 39:20.124
That's not good.

39:20.126 --> 39:21.292
Wade, please.

39:21.294 --> 39:24.195
Cock shot!

39:24.197 --> 39:26.030
Oh, your poor wife.

39:26.032 --> 39:28.265
You really should stop.

39:31.337 --> 39:33.938
All the dinosaurs
feared the <i>T. rex.</i>

39:38.845 --> 39:40.778
I promise this gets
worse for you, big boy!

39:40.780 --> 39:42.747
This is embarrassing.

39:42.749 --> 39:45.416
Please, stay down.

39:45.418 --> 39:48.019
You ever hear of the one-legged
man in the ass-kicking contest?

39:48.021 --> 39:49.420
Do you have
off switch?

39:49.422 --> 39:51.188
Yeah, it's right next
to the prostate.

39:51.190 --> 39:52.323
Or is that the on switch?

39:52.325 --> 39:54.425
Enough!

40:03.036 --> 40:05.302
Let us go talk
to the Professor.

40:05.304 --> 40:07.171
McAvoy or Stewart?

40:07.173 --> 40:09.407
These timelines
are so confusing.

40:10.810 --> 40:13.377
"Dead or alive,
you're coming with me!"

40:13.379 --> 40:15.246
You will
recover, Wade.

40:15.248 --> 40:16.947
You always do.

40:21.354 --> 40:24.989
You ever see <i>127 Hours?</i>
Spoiler alert.

40:28.695 --> 40:29.860
Oh, my God.

40:34.000 --> 40:34.665
Nasty.

40:34.666 --> 40:35.946
Oh, there's
the money shot, baby.

40:36.736 --> 40:38.469
<i>Are You There God?
It's Me, Margaret.</i>

40:49.449 --> 40:52.349
<i>Rock, meet bottom.</i>

40:52.351 --> 40:55.786
<i>And when life ends up
breathtakingly fucked...</i>

40:55.788 --> 40:59.990
<i>you can generally trace it
back to one big, bad decision.</i>

40:59.992 --> 41:03.194
<i>The one that sent you
down the road to Shitsburgh.</i>

41:03.196 --> 41:06.897
<i>This? Well, this was mine.</i>

41:06.899 --> 41:09.767
Mr. Wilson.

41:09.769 --> 41:14.205
Nothing warms my heart more than
a change of someone else's.

41:14.207 --> 41:16.040
You finally hit "fuck it."

41:17.110 --> 41:19.844
Just promise
you'll do right by me.

41:19.846 --> 41:21.912
So I can do right
by someone else.

41:21.914 --> 41:23.814
Of course.

41:23.816 --> 41:25.516
And please don't make
the super-suit green.

41:26.853 --> 41:28.319
Or animated.

41:34.861 --> 41:36.393
Move it! Keep moving.

41:48.407 --> 41:51.342
This place seems sanitary.

41:51.344 --> 41:53.544
My first request
is warmer hands.

41:53.546 --> 41:57.448
Oh! And, Jesus,
a warmer table.

41:59.018 --> 42:01.218
We should really come up
with a safe word, fellas.

42:01.220 --> 42:03.154
I'm thinking
"pork and beans."

42:06.425 --> 42:08.559
Easy.

42:10.496 --> 42:12.963
Aren't you a little
strong for a lady?

42:13.533 --> 42:15.266
I'm calling wang.

42:18.971 --> 42:20.371
What's up with the matches?

42:20.373 --> 42:23.307
Oral fixation
or just a big Stallone fan?

42:24.577 --> 42:26.076
Patience, Angel.

42:26.979 --> 42:28.579
All in good time.

42:28.581 --> 42:30.581
Are you here for
the turndown service, or what?

42:32.185 --> 42:33.751
We have another talker.

42:33.752 --> 42:35.318
I'm just excited about my
first day at superhero camp.

42:35.321 --> 42:37.521
Shut the fuck up.

42:40.860 --> 42:42.893
Mr. Wilson, my name's Ajax.

42:43.863 --> 42:46.997
I manage this workshop.

42:46.999 --> 42:50.267
Ah, my welcome speech used to
be full of euphemisms like...

42:50.269 --> 42:51.902
"This may hurt a little."

42:51.904 --> 42:53.971
"This may cause you
some discomfort."

42:53.973 --> 42:56.273
But I've grown blunt.

42:56.275 --> 42:59.009
This workshop is not
a government-led program.

42:59.011 --> 43:02.546
It's a private institution that turns
reclamation projects like yourself...

43:02.548 --> 43:06.083
into men of
extraordinary abilities.

43:07.553 --> 43:11.021
But if you think super-human
powers are acquired painlessly...

43:11.891 --> 43:13.290
Wrong.

43:13.292 --> 43:14.959
I'm injecting you
with a serum...

43:14.961 --> 43:17.561
that activates any mutant
genes lurking in your DNA.

43:17.563 --> 43:21.565
For it to work we need to
subject you to extreme stress.

43:27.073 --> 43:31.108
You've heard that whole "make an omelet,
break some eggs" bit, right?

43:31.110 --> 43:33.577
I'm about to hurt you, Wade.

43:33.579 --> 43:36.647
I was a patient here once
myself, you know.

43:36.649 --> 43:39.516
The treatment affects
everyone differently.

43:39.518 --> 43:42.653
It made Angel
inhumanly strong.

43:42.655 --> 43:47.258
In my case,
it enhanced my reflexes.

43:47.260 --> 43:50.294
Also scorched my nerve endings,
so I no longer feel pain.

43:51.998 --> 43:55.933
And, in fact,
I no longer feel anything.

44:04.277 --> 44:07.344
Thanks! Thank you. Thank you.

44:07.346 --> 44:10.080
You have something
in your teeth.

44:10.082 --> 44:12.283
Right in the middle there.
Just, I don't...

44:12.285 --> 44:15.386
A little nugget of romaine
lettuce or something.

44:17.223 --> 44:19.690
It's been bothering me
for a long time.

44:21.127 --> 44:22.393
Ah, made you look.

44:22.395 --> 44:24.161
Hey, is Ajax
your actual name?

44:24.163 --> 44:25.996
Because it sounds
suspiciously made up.

44:25.998 --> 44:27.131
What is it, really?

44:27.133 --> 44:29.400
Kevin? Bruce? Scott?

44:29.402 --> 44:31.702
Mitch? The Rickster?

44:31.704 --> 44:33.570
Is it Basil Fawlty?

44:33.572 --> 44:35.539
Oh, joke away.

44:35.541 --> 44:37.041
One thing that never
survives this place

44:37.043 --> 44:39.043
is a sense of humor.

44:39.045 --> 44:40.210
We'll see about that.

44:40.212 --> 44:41.578
I suppose we will.

44:43.049 --> 44:44.548
He's all yours.

44:44.550 --> 44:46.317
Oh, come on.

44:46.319 --> 44:47.718
You're gonna leave me
all alone here.

44:47.720 --> 44:49.486
With less-angry
Rosie O'Donnell?

44:53.726 --> 44:56.026
<i>This is how
it's going to work.</i>

44:56.028 --> 44:59.530
<i>Adrenaline acts as a catalyst
for the serum...</i>

44:59.532 --> 45:02.199
<i>so we're going
to have to make you suffer.</i>

45:03.736 --> 45:05.736
<i>If you're lucky,
the mutant genes will activate</i>

45:05.738 --> 45:08.672
<i>and manifest in
a spectacular fashion.</i>

45:13.045 --> 45:15.746
<i>If not, well, we'll
have to keep on hurting you...</i>

45:17.583 --> 45:19.016
<i>in new and different ways,</i>

45:19.018 --> 45:20.417
<i>each more painful
than the last...</i>

45:23.089 --> 45:25.422
until you finally mutate.

45:27.059 --> 45:28.292
Or die.

45:35.101 --> 45:36.633
You mean a bucket list?

45:36.635 --> 45:39.103
Like a fuck-it list.

45:39.105 --> 45:40.371
I'd really like
to light a spliff

45:40.373 --> 45:42.306
off the Olympic torch.

45:42.308 --> 45:44.241
Pass it
to me right after.

45:44.243 --> 45:47.644
Let's not forget naked
tandem base-jumping

45:47.646 --> 45:51.248
with the WNBA's
Sacramento Monarchs.

45:51.250 --> 45:54.752
Anything on my bucket list
would involve public nudity.

45:54.754 --> 45:58.088
Finally, giving Meredith
Baxter-Birney a Dutch oven.

45:58.090 --> 46:01.258
No. Receiving a Dutch oven
from Meredith Baxter-Birney.

46:05.731 --> 46:09.333
Making banana pancakes
for my kids.

46:12.638 --> 46:14.738
Vanessa.

46:18.277 --> 46:20.611
<i>I wanna see Vanessa.</i>

46:20.613 --> 46:22.146
You're lovely.

46:22.148 --> 46:25.516
I don't know about
anyone else, but I'm touched.

46:25.518 --> 46:26.550
We were just joking.

46:26.552 --> 46:29.086
No, no. It's okay.

46:30.156 --> 46:32.523
I encourage distractions.

46:32.525 --> 46:34.825
Wouldn't want you giving up
on us, now would we?

46:34.827 --> 46:36.760
Hey, don't take any shit
from him, Cunningham.

46:37.696 --> 46:40.230
How tough can he be...

46:40.232 --> 46:43.233
with a name like Francis?

46:43.636 --> 46:45.169
Francis?

46:45.171 --> 46:47.171
That's his legal name.

46:47.173 --> 46:50.641
He got "Ajax"
from the dish soap.

46:52.578 --> 46:56.346
F, R, A, N, C, I...

46:56.649 --> 46:58.215
Oops!

46:59.785 --> 47:02.753
Snagged the dry cleaning tag
off your lab coat.

47:04.590 --> 47:07.191
FYI, I could probably get you
the superhero discount.

47:07.193 --> 47:08.559
You are so
relentlessly annoying.

47:08.561 --> 47:09.593
Thanks.

47:09.595 --> 47:11.228
Never heard that before.

47:11.230 --> 47:14.298
Why don't you do us all
a favor and shut the fuck up?

47:14.300 --> 47:16.366
Or I'll sew
your pretty mouth shut.

47:16.669 --> 47:18.135
Oh...

47:18.137 --> 47:19.736
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

47:19.738 --> 47:21.371
See, here's the problem with

47:21.373 --> 47:23.207
round-the-clock torture...

47:23.209 --> 47:26.243
is that you can't really
step it up from there.

47:28.681 --> 47:31.215
Is that what you think?

47:36.355 --> 47:38.822
If this doesn't unlock
your mutation, then, well...

47:39.625 --> 47:41.425
nothing will.

47:41.427 --> 47:42.943
Now, what we're going to do is

47:42.944 --> 47:44.460
lower the oxygen
concentration in the air...

47:44.463 --> 47:47.364
to the exact point you feel
like you're suffocating.

47:47.366 --> 47:48.632
If your brainwaves slow,

47:48.634 --> 47:51.235
meaning you're
about to pass out...

47:51.237 --> 47:52.436
then we'll turn up the O2.

47:53.372 --> 47:54.771
If your heart rate slows...

47:54.773 --> 47:57.574
meaning you're able
to catch your breath...

47:57.576 --> 47:59.576
we'll turn it back down.

47:59.578 --> 48:01.245
And that's where
we'll leave you.

48:01.247 --> 48:03.614
Right there.

48:03.616 --> 48:05.883
Oh, and I thought
you guys were dicks before.

48:05.885 --> 48:09.219
You know
the funniest part of this?

48:09.221 --> 48:12.389
You still think we're making
you a superhero.

48:12.391 --> 48:15.826
You. A dishonorable discharge.

48:16.529 --> 48:18.662
Hip-deep in hookers.

48:19.365 --> 48:20.931
You're nothing.

48:21.800 --> 48:24.268
Little secret, Wade.

48:24.270 --> 48:26.203
This workshop
doesn't make superheroes,

48:26.205 --> 48:29.406
we make super-slaves.

48:29.408 --> 48:31.241
We're gonna fit you
with a control collar

48:31.243 --> 48:33.810
and auction you off
to the highest bidder.

48:33.812 --> 48:36.213
Who knows what
they'll have you doing?

48:36.215 --> 48:39.616
Terrorizing citizens,
putting down freedom fighters.

48:41.687 --> 48:44.955
Maybe just mow
the occasional lawn.

48:44.957 --> 48:47.624
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

48:52.765 --> 48:55.666
You're never going home
after this.

48:55.668 --> 48:57.901
Now there's a brave face.

48:58.837 --> 49:00.571
Wait, wait! Wait. Wait.

49:02.775 --> 49:06.777
Seriously, you actually have
something in your teeth now.

49:08.647 --> 49:10.447
Enjoy your weekend.

49:10.449 --> 49:12.249
"Weekend"? Back up.

49:12.251 --> 49:13.483
Weekend?

49:54.994 --> 49:57.294
<i>Did I say
this was a love story?</i>

49:57.296 --> 49:59.696
<i>No, it's a horror movie.</i>

50:16.048 --> 50:18.382
Fucking hell.

50:18.384 --> 50:21.652
Looks like someone lost his
shot at Homecoming King.

50:21.654 --> 50:23.787
What have you done to me?

50:23.789 --> 50:25.322
I've merely raised
your stress levels

50:25.324 --> 50:27.057
high enough
to trigger a mutation.

50:27.059 --> 50:29.926
You sadistic fuck!

50:29.928 --> 50:32.396
I've cured you, Wade.

50:32.398 --> 50:35.032
Now your mutated cells
can heal anything.

50:35.034 --> 50:37.868
It's attacking your cancer
as fast as it can form.

50:39.038 --> 50:41.738
Yeah, I've seen similar
side-effects before.

50:42.941 --> 50:44.007
I could cure them...

50:47.646 --> 50:49.446
but where's the fun in that?

50:51.650 --> 50:54.351
Now, I'm gonna
shut you in again, Wade.

50:55.921 --> 50:57.954
Not because I need to.

51:01.827 --> 51:03.694
Because I want to.

51:17.976 --> 51:19.576
Oh, well.

51:19.578 --> 51:20.811
Go ahead.

51:23.782 --> 51:25.649
Oh, you smell like shit.

51:26.819 --> 51:28.852
Whoa!

51:28.854 --> 51:30.821
Motherfucker.

51:30.823 --> 51:32.789
Hey, hey, hey.
It's all right, it's all right.

51:33.826 --> 51:35.826
I think we owe him
that one, yeah?

51:35.828 --> 51:38.395
You take off. Go on.

51:38.964 --> 51:40.497
Off you go.

51:51.443 --> 51:53.009
Quick question.

51:55.147 --> 51:57.414
What's my name?

52:02.988 --> 52:04.521
Didn't think so.

52:06.158 --> 52:09.025
<i>Sorry, Francis.
My lips are sealed.</i>

54:05.544 --> 54:06.877
You don't want to kill me.

54:06.879 --> 54:09.212
I'm the only one
who can fix your ugly mug.

55:05.938 --> 55:07.604
What's my name?

55:13.679 --> 55:14.878
Wade.

56:22.114 --> 56:25.215
<i>I didn't just get</i>
<i>the cure to</i> el cancer...

56:26.752 --> 56:29.352
<i>I got the cure</i>
<i>to</i> el <i>everything.</i>

56:33.025 --> 56:35.258
<i>But there was
only one thing...</i>

56:35.260 --> 56:37.027
<i>that really mattered.</i>

57:06.324 --> 57:07.390
Come on, let's go.

57:12.864 --> 57:15.699
Oh, that must hurt.

57:16.435 --> 57:18.935
Thank you so much.

57:29.948 --> 57:32.182
God, he's so fucking gnarly.

57:32.184 --> 57:33.750
Look at his face.

57:33.752 --> 57:36.086
Oh, my God. Poor guy.

57:36.088 --> 57:37.220
Honey, don't stare.

57:37.222 --> 57:38.488
Freak.

57:58.844 --> 58:02.345
No way. I'm not making
her life as ugly as mine.

58:02.347 --> 58:05.014
Come on, Wade,
it can't be that bad.

58:05.016 --> 58:07.384
Ah, bullshit!

58:07.385 --> 58:09.753
I'm a monster inside and out.
I belong in a fucking circus.

58:09.755 --> 58:12.288
Wade, Vanessa loves you.
She doesn't care what you...

58:12.290 --> 58:14.023
Oh! Oh.

58:14.025 --> 58:15.191
Do you like what you see?

58:15.193 --> 58:16.926
No.

58:16.928 --> 58:18.394
You look like an avocado

58:18.396 --> 58:20.964
had sex with an older,
more disgusting avocado.

58:20.966 --> 58:22.132
Yeah.

58:22.134 --> 58:24.200
Not gently.
Like it was hate-fucking.

58:24.202 --> 58:26.136
There was something wrong
with the relationship...

58:26.138 --> 58:28.071
and that was
the only catharsis

58:28.073 --> 58:29.973
that they could find
without violence.

58:29.975 --> 58:32.375
And the only guy
who can fix this fugly mug...

58:32.377 --> 58:35.211
is the British shitstick
who ran the mutant factory.

58:35.213 --> 58:37.147
And he's gone. Poof!

58:37.149 --> 58:38.982
Yeah, well you gotta do
something to remedy this...

58:38.984 --> 58:40.116
because as of now,

58:40.118 --> 58:42.018
you only have
one course of action.

58:42.020 --> 58:43.253
Damn straight.

58:43.255 --> 58:45.121
Find Francis.
Star in horror films.

58:45.123 --> 58:46.222
What?

58:46.224 --> 58:48.291
Star in your own horror films.

58:48.293 --> 58:49.893
Because you look
like Freddy Krueger

58:49.895 --> 58:53.129
face-fucked
a topographical map of Utah.

58:53.131 --> 58:54.998
Here's what
I'm actually gonna do.

58:55.000 --> 58:56.132
I'm gonna work
through his crew

58:56.134 --> 58:58.118
until somebody
gives up Francis...

58:58.119 --> 59:00.103
force him to fix this, then
put a bullet in his skull...

59:00.105 --> 59:01.871
and fuck the brain hole.

59:01.873 --> 59:05.008
I don't wanna see that
or think of it again.

59:05.010 --> 59:07.110
But the douchebag does
thinks you're dead, right?

59:07.112 --> 59:08.378
Yeah.

59:08.380 --> 59:09.913
That's good.
You should keep it that way.

59:09.915 --> 59:11.514
What, like, wear a mask?

59:11.516 --> 59:14.517
Yes. A very thick mask.
All the time.

59:15.153 --> 59:16.286
I am sorry...

59:16.288 --> 59:19.022
you are haunting.

59:19.024 --> 59:21.024
Your face is
the stuff of nightmares.

59:21.026 --> 59:22.325
Like a testicle with teeth.

59:22.327 --> 59:24.160
You will die alone.

59:24.162 --> 59:26.329
I mean, if you could die.

59:26.331 --> 59:28.398
Ideally, for others' sake.

59:28.400 --> 59:30.033
That'll do.

59:30.035 --> 59:31.901
All you need now is a suit
and a nickname...

59:31.903 --> 59:34.137
like Wade the Wisecracker...

59:34.139 --> 59:37.273
or Scaredevil,
Mr. Neverdie.

59:37.909 --> 59:39.209
Oh, shit.

59:39.578 --> 59:41.544
What?

59:41.546 --> 59:43.580
I put all my money
on you and now...

59:43.582 --> 59:45.181
I just realized
I'm never gonna win the, uh...

59:45.183 --> 59:46.282
Dead pool.

59:50.188 --> 59:52.488
Captain Deadpool...

59:54.326 --> 59:55.458
No, just...

59:55.460 --> 59:57.293
Just Deadpool, yeah.
Just Deadpool.

59:57.295 --> 59:59.462
To you, Mr. Pool.

59:59.464 --> 01:00:00.864
Deadpool.

01:00:00.866 --> 01:00:02.306
That sounds like
a fucking franchise.

01:00:16.581 --> 01:00:19.349
This shit's gonna
have nuts in it.

01:00:19.351 --> 01:00:20.984
Where's Francis?

01:00:34.966 --> 01:00:36.566
Where's Francis?

01:00:44.976 --> 01:00:47.010
Seltzer water
and lemon for blood.

01:00:48.213 --> 01:00:51.180
Or wear red. Dumbass.

01:01:09.701 --> 01:01:11.334
Don't make me
ask twice.

01:01:12.570 --> 01:01:14.137
Where...

01:01:14.139 --> 01:01:16.673
is Francis?

01:01:16.675 --> 01:01:18.508
He made me ask twice.

01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:20.576
Is the mask muffling my voice?

01:01:25.317 --> 01:01:26.950
Where's Francis?

01:01:29.421 --> 01:01:31.354
Where the fuck is Francis?

01:01:40.031 --> 01:01:43.333
You're about to be killed
by a Zamboni.

01:01:43.335 --> 01:01:44.567
Where's Francis?

01:01:46.037 --> 01:01:47.670
No! Please!

01:01:47.672 --> 01:01:50.606
Oh, God! I'm so sorry!

01:01:51.676 --> 01:01:54.577
Oh! You little
spider monkey!

01:01:57.449 --> 01:02:01.050
Where... is... Francis?

01:02:02.153 --> 01:02:03.353
This is confusing.

01:02:03.355 --> 01:02:04.687
Is it sexist to hit you?

01:02:04.689 --> 01:02:06.356
Is it more sexist
to not hit you?

01:02:06.358 --> 01:02:08.725
I mean, the line
gets real... blurry.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:11.000
WHERE IS FRANCIS?

01:02:12.497 --> 01:02:14.564
Tell me where
your fucking boss is

01:02:14.566 --> 01:02:16.432
or you're gonna die!

01:02:16.434 --> 01:02:18.167
In five minutes!

01:02:28.213 --> 01:02:30.113
Don't hesitate to call me.

01:02:45.530 --> 01:02:47.730
Nice to see you, Jared.

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:50.633
I'll take the footlong...

01:02:50.635 --> 01:02:51.701
Fully loaded.

01:03:05.784 --> 01:03:07.350
Whoa, whoa!

01:03:07.352 --> 01:03:09.085
41 confirmed kills.

01:03:09.087 --> 01:03:11.454
Now it's 89.
About to be 90.

01:03:12.223 --> 01:03:13.356
Mr. Wilson?

01:03:13.358 --> 01:03:14.457
Ding-ding.

01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:17.560
You're looking
very alive.

01:03:17.562 --> 01:03:19.829
Ha! Only on the outside!

01:03:19.831 --> 01:03:21.497
This is not going to
end well for me, is it?

01:03:21.499 --> 01:03:22.799
This is not gonna
end well for you, no.

01:03:22.801 --> 01:03:24.167
Where's your boss?

01:03:24.169 --> 01:03:25.668
I can tell you exactly...

01:03:27.439 --> 01:03:29.806
Oh, you'll tell me.
But first...

01:03:29.808 --> 01:03:32.275
You might wanna
look away for this.

01:03:32.277 --> 01:03:33.576
Now this little piggy
went to...

01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:38.081
Thank you, Agent Smith.

01:03:41.519 --> 01:03:42.585
Taxi!

01:03:44.122 --> 01:03:46.422
Hop in! Great day for a ride.

01:03:48.293 --> 01:03:49.933
And we all know
how this turned out.

01:03:52.564 --> 01:03:54.797
<i>Whoops!
You weren't meant to see that.</i>

01:04:02.707 --> 01:04:04.874
There. All caught up.

01:04:12.550 --> 01:04:15.151
We're here.

01:04:15.153 --> 01:04:18.521
Sorry about
bleeding in all your garbage.

01:04:24.696 --> 01:04:26.796
Seltzer water and
lemon for blood.

01:04:27.298 --> 01:04:28.865
Whoo!

01:04:28.867 --> 01:04:31.567
Some kinds of anger
can't be managed...

01:04:31.569 --> 01:04:33.736
like the kind where
your year-long plan

01:04:33.738 --> 01:04:37.340
ends with the wrong guy
getting dismembered!

01:04:37.342 --> 01:04:40.243
That said, when it comes time
to licking wounds,

01:04:40.245 --> 01:04:42.478
there's no place like home.

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:44.580
Ah, and I share that home
with someone you've met,

01:04:44.582 --> 01:04:47.350
the old blind lady
from the laundromat, Al.

01:04:47.352 --> 01:04:49.252
God, I miss cocaine.

01:04:49.254 --> 01:04:51.738
Her.

01:04:51.739 --> 01:04:54.223
Fourth-wall break
inside a fourth-wall break.

01:04:54.225 --> 01:04:57.326
That's like 16 walls.

01:04:57.328 --> 01:04:58.794
She's like Robin to my Batman,

01:04:58.796 --> 01:05:02.732
except she's old,
and black, and blind.

01:05:02.734 --> 01:05:04.767
And I think
she's in love with me.

01:05:04.769 --> 01:05:08.371
<i>Wait, pretty sure
Robin loves Batman, too.</i>

01:05:18.283 --> 01:05:19.348
Al?

01:05:21.619 --> 01:05:23.219
Morning, sleepyhead.

01:05:24.522 --> 01:05:26.689
It smells like
old lady pants in here.

01:05:26.691 --> 01:05:28.691
Yes, I'm old.
I wear pants.

01:05:28.693 --> 01:05:30.560
But you're no lady.

01:05:30.562 --> 01:05:33.829
Oh! So comfy.

01:05:33.831 --> 01:05:36.899
Upside of being blind:
I've never seen you in Crocs.

01:05:36.901 --> 01:05:38.434
You mean my big,
rubber masturbating shoes?

01:05:38.436 --> 01:05:39.936
Yes, I know.

01:05:39.938 --> 01:05:42.705
Downside of being blind...

01:05:42.707 --> 01:05:45.274
I hear everything
in this duplex.

01:05:47.312 --> 01:05:48.544
Sit on a stick.

01:05:48.546 --> 01:05:49.579
Bactin?

01:05:49.581 --> 01:05:53.716
Yeah. Bactin should do it.

01:05:54.786 --> 01:05:56.586
How's that Kullen
coming along?

01:05:56.588 --> 01:05:58.688
IKEA doesn't assemble itself,
you know.

01:05:58.690 --> 01:06:01.691
You're telling me.
I don't mind the Kullen.

01:06:01.693 --> 01:06:04.327
It's an improvement
on the Hurdal.

01:06:04.329 --> 01:06:06.862
Please. Anything's an
improvement over the Hurdal.

01:06:06.864 --> 01:06:10.967
I'd have taken an Hemnes
or a Trysil over the Hurdal.

01:06:10.969 --> 01:06:13.836
Oh, no, I didn't get excited
till I saw the Kullen.

01:06:13.838 --> 01:06:15.004
Screw, please.

01:06:15.006 --> 01:06:16.572
Here? Now?
Just kidding.

01:06:16.574 --> 01:06:17.740
I know it's been decades.

01:06:17.742 --> 01:06:18.908
You'd be surprised.

01:06:19.611 --> 01:06:20.776
Pretty grossed out.

01:06:22.714 --> 01:06:25.281
Ta... Da.

01:06:30.855 --> 01:06:34.490
I wish I never heard
of Craigslist.

01:06:34.492 --> 01:06:35.758
And I quote,
"Looking for roommate,

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.026
"blind to
life's imperfections.

01:06:37.028 --> 01:06:38.811
"Must be good with hands."

01:06:38.812 --> 01:06:40.595
Or would you rather I build
the IKEA, and you pay rent?

01:06:40.598 --> 01:06:42.565
Why such a douche
this morning?

01:06:43.334 --> 01:06:45.034
Let's recap.

01:06:45.035 --> 01:06:46.735
The cock thistle that
turned me into this freak...

01:06:46.738 --> 01:06:48.537
slipped through
my arms today...

01:06:50.008 --> 01:06:51.707
Arm.

01:06:51.709 --> 01:06:53.042
Catching him was
my only chance

01:06:53.044 --> 01:06:54.877
to be hot again,
get my super sexy ex back...

01:06:54.879 --> 01:06:57.346
and prevent this shit from
happening to someone else.

01:06:57.348 --> 01:06:59.348
So, yeah,
today was about as much fun

01:06:59.350 --> 01:07:00.983
as a sandpaper dildo.

01:07:02.887 --> 01:07:04.553
# driveby.

01:07:21.906 --> 01:07:23.939
Found out who our friend
in the red suit is.

01:07:26.377 --> 01:07:29.045
Fucking Wade Wilson.

01:07:29.047 --> 01:07:32.048
I suppose I'd wear a mask too
if I had a face like that.

01:07:32.050 --> 01:07:33.716
I only wish I healed the same.

01:07:37.655 --> 01:07:40.523
Still, we'll put him
out of our misery.

01:07:40.525 --> 01:07:42.024
On our terms.

01:07:42.026 --> 01:07:43.893
Right.
And when he heals?

01:07:44.829 --> 01:07:46.028
He can't.

01:07:46.030 --> 01:07:48.664
Not if there's nothing
left of him to heal.

01:07:48.666 --> 01:07:52.702
You know, it's funny.
I almost miss the fucker.

01:07:54.005 --> 01:07:55.604
I like a challenge.

01:07:56.841 --> 01:07:58.974
But he's bad
for business.

01:07:58.976 --> 01:08:00.810
Now let's go
find him.

01:08:01.679 --> 01:08:02.745
Oh.

01:08:05.116 --> 01:08:06.716
Tylenol PM?

01:08:06.718 --> 01:08:09.618
You can stick that
where you stuck the Bactin.

01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:11.987
I raided my stash
of wisdom tooth Percocet...

01:08:11.989 --> 01:08:16.058
and I am orbiting
fucking Saturn right now.

01:08:18.863 --> 01:08:21.831
But I appreciate the gesture.

01:08:21.832 --> 01:08:26.435
Am I crazy,
or is your hand really small?

01:08:26.437 --> 01:08:28.470
About the size of
a KFC spork.

01:08:28.473 --> 01:08:30.372
Ugh.

01:08:30.375 --> 01:08:32.608
I get why you're so pissy...

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:34.143
but your mood's
never gonna brighten

01:08:34.145 --> 01:08:35.611
till you find this woman...

01:08:35.613 --> 01:08:36.979
and tell her how you feel.

01:08:36.981 --> 01:08:38.680
What do I keep telling you,
Mrs. Magoo?

01:08:38.683 --> 01:08:40.515
She wouldn't have me.

01:08:40.518 --> 01:08:42.151
If you could see me,
you'd understand.

01:08:42.153 --> 01:08:43.486
Looks aren't everything.

01:08:43.488 --> 01:08:44.620
Looks are everything.

01:08:44.622 --> 01:08:46.721
You ever heard
David Beckham speak?

01:08:46.724 --> 01:08:49.058
It's like he mouth-sexed
a can of helium.

01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:50.626
You think Ryan Reynolds
got this far

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:52.495
on his superior acting method?

01:08:52.497 --> 01:08:53.763
Love is blind, Wade.

01:08:53.765 --> 01:08:54.830
No.

01:08:55.867 --> 01:08:57.800
You're blind.

01:08:57.801 --> 01:09:00.770
So, you're just gonna
lie there and whimper?

01:09:00.772 --> 01:09:02.872
No, I'm gonna wait till this
arm plows through puberty...

01:09:02.874 --> 01:09:03.906
and then I'm gonna
come up with

01:09:03.908 --> 01:09:05.108
a whole new
Christmas Day plan.

01:09:05.810 --> 01:09:07.076
In the meantime,

01:09:07.078 --> 01:09:09.078
you might wanna
leave the room.

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:11.680
I bet it feels huge
in this hand.

01:09:12.917 --> 01:09:16.085
Go, go, go.

01:09:16.087 --> 01:09:17.886
So, the doctor says,
"The bad news is

01:09:17.889 --> 01:09:19.339
"you don't have
that long to live."

01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:20.790
So, the patient says,
"How long do I have?"

01:09:20.792 --> 01:09:22.758
The doctor says, "Five."

01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:24.493
The guy says, "Five what?"

01:09:24.495 --> 01:09:27.696
And the doctor says,
"Four, three, two..."

01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:37.038
Can I help you ladies?

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:40.843
Oh, I do hope so.

01:09:44.948 --> 01:09:46.582
I heard you might be
able to point me

01:09:46.584 --> 01:09:49.685
in the direction
of a, um, friend of mine.

01:09:49.687 --> 01:09:50.752
Name of Wade Wilson.

01:09:52.122 --> 01:09:53.456
Sorry.

01:09:53.457 --> 01:09:54.990
I don't know the name.

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:04.733
Hey, you're not supposed
to be behind the bar.

01:10:08.239 --> 01:10:10.206
I've seen this girl.

01:10:10.208 --> 01:10:11.707
Ah, this must be Vanessa.

01:10:11.709 --> 01:10:12.908
I've heard so much about you.

01:10:17.114 --> 01:10:19.882
Um, sweetheart,
you might wanna look around.

01:10:19.884 --> 01:10:22.651
This isn't really the place
to do something like that.

01:10:23.888 --> 01:10:25.721
Easy, Angel.

01:10:25.723 --> 01:10:27.089
Put the little man down.

01:10:28.693 --> 01:10:30.826
We have everything
we need now.

01:10:30.828 --> 01:10:32.628
You sure?

01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:35.731
You don't want any clothes
that are not monochromatic?

01:10:35.733 --> 01:10:38.534
Have fun at your midnight
showing of <i>Blade II.</i>

01:10:40.605 --> 01:10:42.004
Whoo.

01:10:42.006 --> 01:10:43.839
Thanks for having
my back, guys.

01:10:48.779 --> 01:10:51.146
Wade, we have
a fucking problem.

01:10:51.148 --> 01:10:53.916
And by "we," I mean "you."

01:10:53.918 --> 01:10:56.051
Ah, I can't believe
I'm doing this.

01:10:56.053 --> 01:10:58.988
Is there a word for
half afraid, half angry?

01:10:58.990 --> 01:11:01.156
Yeah, "afrangry",
I guess.

01:11:01.158 --> 01:11:03.025
Have you decided what
you're gonna say to her?

01:11:03.027 --> 01:11:04.293
Fuck me!

01:11:04.295 --> 01:11:06.295
Uh, maybe not
start with that.

01:11:12.136 --> 01:11:15.604
<i>Hey, coming onto
our stage right now...</i>

01:11:15.606 --> 01:11:17.806
<i>give it up for Chastity!</i>

01:11:21.612 --> 01:11:23.913
Or as I like
to call her, Irony.

01:11:23.915 --> 01:11:26.048
Better find her fast
before numbnuts does.

01:11:26.050 --> 01:11:27.683
How do you know
she's in here?

01:11:27.685 --> 01:11:30.853
Because I'm constantly
stalking that fox.

01:11:55.813 --> 01:12:00.082
<i>Every time I see her,
it's like the first time...</i>

01:12:00.084 --> 01:12:02.284
<i>Especially from this angle.</i>

01:12:25.810 --> 01:12:27.109
<i>You can't buy love,</i>

01:12:27.111 --> 01:12:29.912
<i>but you can rent it
for three minutes.</i>

01:12:32.850 --> 01:12:35.651
Ah, you weak motherfucker!

01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:37.286
Come on!

01:12:38.389 --> 01:12:39.855
Come on, get it together.

01:12:39.857 --> 01:12:41.924
This isn't about me,
this is about Vanessa.

01:12:45.963 --> 01:12:47.296
Here we go.

01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:51.667
Maximum effort.

01:12:55.006 --> 01:12:56.171
Vanessa.

01:12:58.743 --> 01:13:00.743
Someone out back
asking for you.

01:13:00.745 --> 01:13:02.911
Something about, uh,
an old boyfriend.

01:13:30.141 --> 01:13:31.273
I knew it was you.

01:13:33.077 --> 01:13:35.110
The weird,
curvy edges.

01:13:36.681 --> 01:13:38.414
Like a jigsaw puzzle.

01:13:48.426 --> 01:13:50.392
You have Wade Wilson
to thank for this.

01:13:59.336 --> 01:14:01.070
Hey. Hey! Where'd she go?

01:14:01.072 --> 01:14:03.038
Uh, I saw her
head to the back.

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.406
Go get her, tiger.

01:14:27.364 --> 01:14:29.865
Fuck. Fuck!

01:14:32.369 --> 01:14:34.203
Motherfucker!

01:14:34.205 --> 01:14:35.337
Wait, wait.
Let's... Just...

01:14:35.339 --> 01:14:36.405
Cock juggling...

01:14:36.406 --> 01:14:37.472
We can talk about
what we're gonna...

01:14:37.475 --> 01:14:38.507
Jiminy! Fuck face!

01:14:38.509 --> 01:14:39.942
Okay, or you
can hit that.

01:14:39.944 --> 01:14:41.844
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Fuck! Fuck!

01:14:41.846 --> 01:14:43.212
No, no.
All right. Hey!

01:14:43.214 --> 01:14:44.980
Fuck! Fuck!

01:14:44.982 --> 01:14:46.515
Fuck!
Hey, um...

01:14:46.517 --> 01:14:49.118
Whoa! Whoa!
Relax. Relax. Okay.

01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:50.419
Okay. I think
that's a good start.

01:14:50.421 --> 01:14:52.488
Oh, I'm gonna rip
his motherfucking...

01:14:52.490 --> 01:14:53.756
Wait.

01:14:53.758 --> 01:14:55.224
Find it! Find it.
What?

01:14:55.226 --> 01:14:57.092
I'm gonna get angry.
Okay. All right.

01:14:57.094 --> 01:14:58.961
All right. Okay. All right.

01:14:58.963 --> 01:15:00.262
Here. This is Vanessa.

01:15:00.264 --> 01:15:02.297
What?
No, wait. It's Francis.

01:15:02.299 --> 01:15:05.100
He wants you
to come to him.

01:15:05.102 --> 01:15:06.869
What is that?
That's the shit emoji.

01:15:06.871 --> 01:15:09.004
You know, it's the turd with
the smiling face and the eyes?

01:15:09.006 --> 01:15:11.340
I thought it was chocolate
yogurt for so long.

01:15:12.042 --> 01:15:13.275
I need guns.

01:15:13.277 --> 01:15:14.409
Okay, which ones?

01:15:14.411 --> 01:15:15.544
I need all the guns!

01:15:15.546 --> 01:15:17.012
All right. Okay.

01:15:37.468 --> 01:15:39.101
That's about 3,000 rounds.

01:15:40.037 --> 01:15:42.404
We all know
what I can do with 12.

01:15:42.406 --> 01:15:44.573
Hey, hey, careful with that,
Ronnie Milsap!

01:15:44.575 --> 01:15:45.941
We're downrange.

01:15:47.211 --> 01:15:48.877
I was gonna
spend the night

01:15:48.879 --> 01:15:52.014
assembling the Borje,
but this is holding my interest.

01:15:52.016 --> 01:15:54.917
I told you, we're going with
the Urvaj, not the Borje.

01:15:54.919 --> 01:15:56.919
Get it through your head
or get out of fuck town.

01:15:56.921 --> 01:15:59.588
Shit. That's all the pieces
in the house.

01:15:59.590 --> 01:16:01.924
Nah, nah... Come on.
Let's go. Cough it up.

01:16:01.926 --> 01:16:03.392
Up, up, up.

01:16:04.428 --> 01:16:05.961
Oh. Down, down, down.

01:16:05.963 --> 01:16:07.029
Fuck you.

01:16:08.833 --> 01:16:11.533
.45 cal. I like it.

01:16:13.571 --> 01:16:15.003
Wade...

01:16:16.106 --> 01:16:18.974
I'd go with you,
but I don't want to.

01:16:22.046 --> 01:16:23.345
Uh...

01:16:23.347 --> 01:16:24.546
Listen, Al...

01:16:25.516 --> 01:16:28.183
if I never see
you again,

01:16:28.185 --> 01:16:31.620
I want you to know that
I love you very much.

01:16:31.622 --> 01:16:35.490
And also, uh, there's
about 116 kilos of cocaine

01:16:35.492 --> 01:16:37.025
buried somewhere
in the apartment...

01:16:37.027 --> 01:16:39.862
right next to the cure
for blindness. Good luck.

01:16:45.202 --> 01:16:46.635
You wanna get fucked up?

01:16:56.513 --> 01:16:58.180
Put her down
over here.

01:17:08.259 --> 01:17:09.491
Go on then.

01:17:11.996 --> 01:17:14.997
Thanks, dickless.
And I mean you.

01:17:14.999 --> 01:17:18.300
Wow. You're a talker too.
You and Wade.

01:17:18.302 --> 01:17:20.135
I've been trying
to tell you assholes,

01:17:20.137 --> 01:17:21.536
you've got the wrong girl.

01:17:21.538 --> 01:17:23.238
My old boyfriend,
he's dead.

01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:27.009
See, I thought that too.
But he keeps on coming back.

01:17:27.011 --> 01:17:28.277
Like a cockroach...

01:17:28.279 --> 01:17:30.545
but uglier.

01:17:30.547 --> 01:17:35.183
Now, I may not feel,
but he does.

01:17:35.185 --> 01:17:37.225
Let's see how he fights
with your head on the block.

01:17:46.063 --> 01:17:47.529
Ripley, from <i>Alien 3!</i>

01:17:48.165 --> 01:17:50.132
Fuck, you're old.

01:17:51.568 --> 01:17:54.036
Fake laugh.
Hiding real pain.

01:17:54.038 --> 01:17:55.370
Go get Silver Balls.

01:17:55.372 --> 01:17:57.940
You guys going for a bite?
Early bird special?

01:17:57.942 --> 01:17:59.174
Oh, like there's
something wrong

01:17:59.176 --> 01:18:00.709
with eating before sundown
or saving money.

01:18:00.711 --> 01:18:04.246
No, you know that bad guy
that you let go?

01:18:04.682 --> 01:18:06.615
He's got my girl.

01:18:06.617 --> 01:18:08.450
You're gonna
help me get her back.

01:18:08.452 --> 01:18:10.352
Wade, is that you?

01:18:10.354 --> 01:18:12.020
Yeah, it's me, Deadpool,

01:18:12.022 --> 01:18:14.957
and I got an offer
that you can't refuse.

01:18:17.461 --> 01:18:18.560
I'm gonna wait
out here, okay?

01:18:18.562 --> 01:18:20.128
It's a big house.

01:18:20.130 --> 01:18:21.964
It's funny that I only
ever see two of you.

01:18:21.966 --> 01:18:24.247
It's almost like the studio
couldn't afford another X-Man.

01:18:27.604 --> 01:18:29.237
And that is why,
in my opinion...

01:18:29.239 --> 01:18:32.975
the movie <i>Cocoon</i>
is pure pornography.

01:18:32.977 --> 01:18:34.643
Who brought
this twinkly man?

01:18:34.645 --> 01:18:36.745
Twinkly, but deadly.

01:18:36.747 --> 01:18:39.348
My chrome-penised
friend back there

01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:41.450
has agreed
to do me this solid.

01:18:41.452 --> 01:18:43.452
In exchange,
I said that I would

01:18:43.454 --> 01:18:45.487
consider joining his boy band.

01:18:45.489 --> 01:18:46.755
It's not boy band.

01:18:46.757 --> 01:18:48.590
Sure it's not.

01:18:48.592 --> 01:18:51.626
So,
any luck winning Gita back?

01:18:51.628 --> 01:18:54.229
I tried to hold on tight,
Mr. Pool...

01:18:54.231 --> 01:18:58.467
but Bandhu is more craftier
and handsomer than me.

01:18:58.469 --> 01:19:00.302
Well, I think you're
pretty darn cute.

01:19:06.143 --> 01:19:07.709
Dopinder.
Hmm?

01:19:09.113 --> 01:19:10.178
What was that?

01:19:10.748 --> 01:19:12.147
Uh...

01:19:12.149 --> 01:19:17.719
That was Bandhu
in the trunk.

01:19:18.389 --> 01:19:20.456
Ban who?

01:19:20.457 --> 01:19:22.524
My romantic rival Bandhu.
He's tied up in the trunk.

01:19:22.526 --> 01:19:24.292
I'm doing as you said, DP.

01:19:24.294 --> 01:19:26.294
I plan to gut him
like a tandoori fish,

01:19:26.296 --> 01:19:28.196
then dump his carcass
on Gita's doorstep.

01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:31.166
I did not tell him
to do that.

01:19:31.168 --> 01:19:33.769
Absolutely not.
It got lost in translation.

01:19:33.771 --> 01:19:37.172
Dopinder, this is no way
to win Gita's heart back!

01:19:37.174 --> 01:19:38.807
I'm so proud of you.

01:19:38.808 --> 01:19:40.441
Drop Bandhu off,
safe and gentle-like.

01:19:40.444 --> 01:19:41.510
Kill him.

01:19:41.512 --> 01:19:43.678
And then,
win Gita back...

01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:46.548
the old fashioned way:
with your boyish charm.

01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:48.150
Kidnap her.

01:19:49.453 --> 01:19:50.652
He's super dead.

01:19:51.188 --> 01:19:52.254
Whoa!

01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:57.692
I presume a crisp
high five?

01:19:57.694 --> 01:20:00.562
For you? 10.

01:20:00.564 --> 01:20:03.432
Okay, guys, let's get out there
and make a difference.

01:20:03.434 --> 01:20:05.400
You know what to do.

01:20:06.303 --> 01:20:09.071
Knock 'em dead,
Pool Boy!

01:20:10.174 --> 01:20:12.240
Time to make
the chimi-fuckin'-changas.

01:20:13.577 --> 01:20:15.310
<i>Not often
a dude ruins your face...</i>

01:20:15.312 --> 01:20:18.313
<i>skull-stomps your sanity,
grabs your future baby mama...</i>

01:20:18.315 --> 01:20:20.082
<i>and personally sees to four</i>

01:20:20.084 --> 01:20:22.484
<i>of your five
shittiest moments.</i>

01:20:22.486 --> 01:20:26.688
<i>Let's just say it's beginning
to look a lot like Christmas.</i>

01:20:39.603 --> 01:20:41.103
Hey.

01:20:41.105 --> 01:20:42.404
Where's your duffle bag?

01:21:01.225 --> 01:21:04.192
Bandhu?

01:21:04.194 --> 01:21:06.261
<i>Leave a message
and have a happy day.</i>

01:21:06.263 --> 01:21:07.629
God damn it!

01:21:07.631 --> 01:21:09.397
I'm gonna do this
the old fashioned way...

01:21:09.399 --> 01:21:12.834
with two swords
and maximum effort.

01:21:13.770 --> 01:21:14.870
Cue the music.

01:21:30.921 --> 01:21:33.922
Wade Wilson!

01:21:33.924 --> 01:21:35.657
What's my name?

01:21:35.659 --> 01:21:37.859
Oh, I'mma fuckin'
spell it out for ya.

01:21:40.230 --> 01:21:41.363
Go get some.

01:21:41.365 --> 01:21:42.531
Superhero landing.

01:21:42.533 --> 01:21:43.665
She's gonna do
a superhero landing.

01:21:43.667 --> 01:21:44.733
Wait for it.

01:21:47.938 --> 01:21:49.237
Whoo!

01:21:49.239 --> 01:21:50.805
Superhero landing!

01:21:50.807 --> 01:21:52.307
You know, that's really
hard on your knees.

01:21:52.309 --> 01:21:54.276
Totally impractical.
They all do it.

01:21:54.278 --> 01:21:57.546
You're a lovely lady, but
I'm saving myself for Francis.

01:21:57.548 --> 01:21:58.847
That's why
I brought him.

01:21:58.849 --> 01:22:02.184
I prefer not to hit a woman,
so please...

01:22:09.293 --> 01:22:12.394
I mean,
that's why I brought her?

01:22:13.797 --> 01:22:15.964
Oh, no, finish your tweet.
It's not... That's...

01:22:15.966 --> 01:22:17.666
Just give us a second.
Yeah.

01:22:17.668 --> 01:22:19.201
There you go.
Hashtag it.

01:22:20.437 --> 01:22:22.370
Go get her, tiger.

01:22:28.845 --> 01:22:32.681
Oh, I so pity the dude who
pressures her into prom sex.

01:22:33.417 --> 01:22:35.217
All right, then. Fire!

01:22:46.630 --> 01:22:48.363
Finish fucking her
the fuck up!

01:22:48.365 --> 01:22:49.464
Language, please.

01:22:49.466 --> 01:22:50.699
Suck a cock.

01:23:16.627 --> 01:23:18.426
Look away, child.

01:23:18.929 --> 01:23:20.462
Look away!

01:23:27.671 --> 01:23:29.004
Wait!

01:23:29.006 --> 01:23:30.338
Wait!

01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:31.373
Cease fire!

01:23:31.375 --> 01:23:32.674
Cease fire!

01:23:32.676 --> 01:23:34.309
Fellas! Hey! Hey!

01:23:35.545 --> 01:23:39.381
You only work for that
shit-spackled muppet fart.

01:23:39.383 --> 01:23:41.549
So, I'mma give you a chance

01:23:41.551 --> 01:23:43.418
for y'all to lay down
your firearms...

01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:46.488
in exchange for preferential,
bordering on gentle...

01:23:46.490 --> 01:23:50.058
possibly even
lover-like treatment.

01:23:51.895 --> 01:23:53.061
Fine.

01:23:53.063 --> 01:23:54.362
Commando!

01:25:06.370 --> 01:25:07.502
Teabag!

01:25:11.875 --> 01:25:12.941
Bob?

01:25:13.877 --> 01:25:15.127
Wade?

01:25:15.128 --> 01:25:16.378
Oh, my God,
I haven't seen you since...

01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:18.680
Jacksonville. Fridays.
Since TGI Fridays.

01:25:19.483 --> 01:25:21.716
Well, what the hell!

01:25:21.718 --> 01:25:23.385
God, come here, you.

01:25:25.455 --> 01:25:27.856
How are the kids?
Good?

01:25:27.858 --> 01:25:29.691
And Gail, she still fixing
that tuna casserole?

01:25:29.693 --> 01:25:31.526
So good.
But bad for the waistline,

01:25:31.528 --> 01:25:32.888
if you know what
I'm talking about.

01:25:37.167 --> 01:25:39.401
Oh!

01:25:39.403 --> 01:25:42.737
Your... On the left.
You are beautiful woman.

01:25:42.739 --> 01:25:44.005
That is so sweet.

01:25:44.007 --> 01:25:45.140
Uh...

01:25:45.142 --> 01:25:46.408
Thanks.

01:25:58.488 --> 01:25:59.254
Yoo-hoo!

01:25:59.255 --> 01:26:00.021
Does he
write you notes too?

01:26:00.023 --> 01:26:02.424
He's such a romantic.

01:26:02.426 --> 01:26:03.826
Don't worry, baby.
I'm comin'.

01:26:05.028 --> 01:26:06.561
Fire!

01:26:13.770 --> 01:26:15.537
Hey!

01:26:15.539 --> 01:26:16.604
Climb on!

01:26:53.577 --> 01:26:55.076
Motherfucking...

01:27:06.490 --> 01:27:08.957
Motherfucker should have
worn his brown pants.

01:27:11.728 --> 01:27:12.927
You were right,
beautiful.

01:27:13.763 --> 01:27:15.630
Red really is my color.

01:27:16.132 --> 01:27:17.265
Wade?

01:27:17.267 --> 01:27:18.733
Don't worry, baby...

01:27:18.735 --> 01:27:21.135
I'mma get you out
of that shit-box.

01:27:21.137 --> 01:27:23.571
What better way to crawl back
inside that head of yours?

01:27:23.573 --> 01:27:25.507
Oh, you never left.

01:27:25.509 --> 01:27:27.642
But you did, asshole!

01:27:27.644 --> 01:27:29.077
Ah, deep breath, darling.

01:27:30.647 --> 01:27:31.813
Oh, wait.

01:27:32.849 --> 01:27:34.549
Wrong choice of words.

01:27:37.586 --> 01:27:39.586
I hope they blocked pain
to your every last nerve.

01:27:39.589 --> 01:27:40.722
'Cause I'mma go lookin'!

01:27:41.992 --> 01:27:44.626
I hear you grow back
body parts now, Wade.

01:27:44.628 --> 01:27:45.727
When I'm finished...

01:27:45.729 --> 01:27:47.629
parts will have
to grow back you.

01:27:47.631 --> 01:27:48.796
Good one.

01:27:49.666 --> 01:27:51.599
Yep, that was a good one.

01:27:51.601 --> 01:27:52.667
Let's dance.

01:27:53.904 --> 01:27:55.136
And by dance, I mean...

01:27:55.138 --> 01:27:56.771
let's try to kill each other.

01:28:50.961 --> 01:28:53.361
Fine. Fists.

01:28:53.363 --> 01:28:55.597
Oh, sounds like
your last Saturday night.

01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:19.280
Asshole!

01:31:15.505 --> 01:31:17.105
Hang in there,
baby!

01:31:17.107 --> 01:31:19.173
Wade!
I gotcha!

01:31:22.412 --> 01:31:24.879
I got a plan.
You're not gonna like it.

01:31:35.125 --> 01:31:36.290
Shit! Shit! Shit!

01:31:42.165 --> 01:31:44.832
Don't worry.
I'm totally on top of this.

01:31:59.916 --> 01:32:01.949
Ah! Damn it!

01:32:02.786 --> 01:32:05.787
Maximum effort!

01:32:48.031 --> 01:32:49.096
Thanks.

01:32:54.037 --> 01:32:55.570
Just take it slow.

01:33:02.278 --> 01:33:03.845
Yoo-hoo!

01:33:06.082 --> 01:33:08.850
Oh, my God! That was so...

01:33:39.649 --> 01:33:42.350
There are no words!

01:33:42.352 --> 01:33:46.087
Me and you are headed
to fix this butterface.

01:33:46.656 --> 01:33:48.022
What?

01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:53.394
You stupid fucking idiot.

01:33:53.396 --> 01:33:58.099
Did you really think
there was a cure... for that?

01:33:59.936 --> 01:34:01.302
What?

01:34:01.304 --> 01:34:02.403
You heard me.

01:34:04.173 --> 01:34:05.339
No.

01:34:05.341 --> 01:34:06.574
No!

01:34:13.917 --> 01:34:17.518
So, you mean to say...

01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:22.390
after all this,
you can't fix me?

01:34:22.392 --> 01:34:24.525
It sounds even stupider
when you say it.

01:34:24.527 --> 01:34:26.460
Like the kind of stupid
who admits

01:34:26.462 --> 01:34:29.630
he can't do the one thing
I'm keeping him alive for?

01:34:33.503 --> 01:34:35.369
Any last words?

01:34:37.206 --> 01:34:38.339
What's my name?

01:34:39.375 --> 01:34:40.508
Who fucking cares?

01:34:40.510 --> 01:34:41.575
Wade!

01:34:43.212 --> 01:34:46.080
Four or five moments.

01:34:46.082 --> 01:34:47.815
I'm sorry?

01:34:47.816 --> 01:34:49.549
Four or five moments,
that's all it takes.

01:34:50.186 --> 01:34:51.252
To?

01:34:52.155 --> 01:34:53.487
Be a hero.

01:34:55.525 --> 01:34:58.426
Everyone thinks
it's a full-time job.

01:34:58.428 --> 01:35:00.728
Wake up a hero,
brush your teeth a hero,

01:35:00.730 --> 01:35:02.163
go to work a hero.

01:35:02.498 --> 01:35:04.398
Not true.

01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:07.601
Over a lifetime, there are
only four or five moments

01:35:07.603 --> 01:35:10.237
that really matter.

01:35:10.239 --> 01:35:12.673
Moments when you're
offered a choice.

01:35:12.675 --> 01:35:15.443
To make a sacrifice,
conquer a flaw,

01:35:15.445 --> 01:35:17.078
save a friend...

01:35:17.513 --> 01:35:20.681
spare an enemy.

01:35:20.683 --> 01:35:22.249
In these moments...

01:35:23.019 --> 01:35:26.420
everything else falls away.

01:35:26.422 --> 01:35:29.423
The way the world sees us.

01:35:29.425 --> 01:35:30.491
The way we...

01:35:34.630 --> 01:35:35.763
Why?

01:35:37.033 --> 01:35:39.100
You were droning on.

01:35:39.102 --> 01:35:42.169
Sure, I may be stuck looking
like pepperoni flatbread...

01:35:42.171 --> 01:35:45.206
but at least fuckface
won't heal from that.

01:35:45.208 --> 01:35:48.275
If wearing superhero tights...

01:35:48.277 --> 01:35:49.677
means sparing psychopaths...

01:35:49.679 --> 01:35:52.046
then maybe I wasn't
meant to wear 'em.

01:35:52.048 --> 01:35:54.382
Not everyone monitors
a hall like you.

01:35:54.384 --> 01:35:55.483
Just promise...

01:35:55.485 --> 01:35:57.218
Yeah, yeah,
I'll be on the lookout

01:35:57.220 --> 01:35:59.453
for the next four moments.

01:35:59.455 --> 01:36:01.188
Oh, shit.

01:36:01.190 --> 01:36:04.792
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm just a boy,

01:36:04.794 --> 01:36:07.194
about to stand
in front of a girl...

01:36:07.196 --> 01:36:08.496
and tell her...

01:36:08.498 --> 01:36:10.564
What the fuck
am I gonna tell her?

01:36:10.566 --> 01:36:14.035
Well, hmm,
you better figure it out.

01:36:15.371 --> 01:36:16.637
I can't even tell you...

01:36:16.639 --> 01:36:18.506
I deserved that.
That, too.

01:36:18.508 --> 01:36:20.274
No, no, no,
maybe not the nethers.

01:36:20.276 --> 01:36:22.243
Start talking!

01:36:24.213 --> 01:36:26.080
I'm sorry.

01:36:26.082 --> 01:36:28.315
I'm so sorry.

01:36:28.317 --> 01:36:30.818
For everything,
I'm sorry for leaving...

01:36:32.355 --> 01:36:34.455
I'm sorry for not
cowboying up sooner.

01:36:34.457 --> 01:36:36.290
It's been rough
couple of years.

01:36:36.292 --> 01:36:37.358
Rough?

01:36:45.134 --> 01:36:47.068
I live in a crackhouse.

01:36:48.204 --> 01:36:49.537
With a family of 12.

01:36:51.274 --> 01:36:52.740
Every night
we spoon for warmth.

01:36:52.742 --> 01:36:55.810
Everybody fights for Noelle.
She's the fattest.

01:36:55.812 --> 01:36:57.578
There's nothing
that we don't share.

01:36:57.580 --> 01:37:01.782
Floor space, dental floss,
even condoms.

01:37:09.792 --> 01:37:12.193
So, you live in a house.

01:37:20.803 --> 01:37:23.838
I should have come
and found you sooner.

01:37:25.341 --> 01:37:26.674
But, baby,
the guy under this mask,

01:37:26.676 --> 01:37:29.376
he ain't the same one
that you remember.

01:37:33.616 --> 01:37:34.849
You mean this mask?

01:37:54.904 --> 01:37:56.637
And this one.

01:37:58.141 --> 01:37:59.840
In case the other fell off.

01:38:02.745 --> 01:38:05.212
All right.
Yeah, just... Ow.

01:38:05.214 --> 01:38:06.814
Like a Band-Aid,
just give it a...

01:38:06.816 --> 01:38:09.150
Owdie 5,000.

01:38:09.152 --> 01:38:10.284
Wait, wait, wait...

01:38:12.155 --> 01:38:13.420
Are you sure?

01:38:15.258 --> 01:38:16.323
I'm sure.

01:38:26.536 --> 01:38:27.601
Wow.

01:38:28.838 --> 01:38:30.204
Yeah.

01:38:36.879 --> 01:38:38.412
Hey.

01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:42.783
After a brief
adjustment period...

01:38:42.785 --> 01:38:44.785
and a bunch of drinks...

01:38:46.255 --> 01:38:48.289
it's a face...

01:38:52.595 --> 01:38:54.361
I'd be happy to sit on.

01:39:01.671 --> 01:39:05.306
I'm not the same
underneath this suit, either.

01:39:05.308 --> 01:39:06.740
No.

01:39:06.742 --> 01:39:08.742
Super-penis.

01:39:08.744 --> 01:39:10.844
Come on, Wade. Language.

01:39:10.846 --> 01:39:12.413
Young one is present.

01:39:13.416 --> 01:39:15.349
What are you still doing?

01:39:15.351 --> 01:39:17.952
Get out of here.
Go make yourself useful!

01:39:17.954 --> 01:39:20.821
You, go be a really
big brother to someone.

01:39:20.823 --> 01:39:22.656
Tell Beast to stop
shitting on my lawn.

01:39:22.658 --> 01:39:24.625
And you,
chicken noodle...

01:39:24.627 --> 01:39:26.527
Nothing compares to you.

01:39:26.529 --> 01:39:28.629
Sinead O'Connor, 1990.
Sorry.

01:39:28.631 --> 01:39:31.465
That's all right.
You're cool.

01:39:33.336 --> 01:39:34.935
What in the ass?

01:39:34.937 --> 01:39:38.505
That was not mean.
I'm proud of you!

01:39:38.507 --> 01:39:41.675
We will make an X-Man
of you yet, Wade.

01:39:41.677 --> 01:39:42.977
For a second there,

01:39:42.979 --> 01:39:44.812
it felt like we were
three mini-lion robots...

01:39:44.814 --> 01:39:47.248
coming together to form
one super robot.

01:39:47.883 --> 01:39:49.283
There's a stupid.

01:39:49.285 --> 01:39:50.384
Yeah.

01:39:53.689 --> 01:39:58.259
And now, for the moment
I've all been waiting for.

01:40:01.797 --> 01:40:02.963
Come here.

01:40:12.808 --> 01:40:15.843
Wham! As promised.

01:40:28.824 --> 01:40:30.424

01:40:30.426 --> 01:40:33.694

01:47:07.790 --> 01:47:09.356
You're still here?

01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:15.062
It's over. Go home.

01:47:16.765 --> 01:47:19.232
Oh, you're expecting
a teaser for <i>Deadpool 2.</i>

01:47:19.234 --> 01:47:22.069
Well, we don't have
that kind of money.

01:47:22.071 --> 01:47:25.105
What are you expecting?
Sam Jackson to show up?

01:47:25.107 --> 01:47:27.874
With an eye patch and a saucy
little leather number?

01:47:27.876 --> 01:47:29.443
Go. Go.

01:47:34.783 --> 01:47:36.550
Oh.

01:47:36.551 --> 01:47:38.318
But I can tell you one thing,
and it's a bit of a secret.

01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:41.488
For the sequel,
we're gonna have Cable.

01:47:41.490 --> 01:47:44.057
Amazing character.
Bionic arm, time travel.

01:47:44.059 --> 01:47:45.225
We have no idea
who we're gonna cast yet,

01:47:45.227 --> 01:47:46.359
but it could be anybody.

01:47:46.361 --> 01:47:47.994
Just need a big guy
with a flat top.

01:47:47.996 --> 01:47:49.796
Could be Mel Gibson,
Dolph Lundgren...

01:47:49.798 --> 01:47:52.232
Keira Knightley.
She's got range. Who knows.

01:47:52.234 --> 01:47:53.800
Anyway, big secret. Shh...

01:47:53.802 --> 01:47:55.836
Oh, and don't leave your
garbage all lying around.

01:47:55.838 --> 01:47:58.238
It's a total dick move.

01:47:59.141 --> 01:48:00.273
Go.
