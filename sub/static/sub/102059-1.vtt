WEBVTT

00:13.292 --> 00:14.581
Equalizing
that reach early.

00:14.583 --> 00:16.790
- Mixing things up.
- Oh, she's tagged her!

00:16.792 --> 00:18.165
She's tagged her again!

00:18.167 --> 00:20.040
- Oh and again.
- Oh, shit.

00:20.042 --> 00:22.665
Katrina's in trouble.
She's in trouble, Mike.

00:22.667 --> 00:23.500
Big trouble.

00:24.333 --> 00:25.915
Can she finish
it, right here, right now?

00:25.917 --> 00:27.873
Oh, she
shot her to the body!

00:27.875 --> 00:30.331
Katrina's in huge trouble, Mike.

00:30.333 --> 00:32.415
Oh, my! Over and over!

00:32.417 --> 00:34.873
- Boom, that's it!
- Oh, my goodness!

00:34.875 --> 00:36.042
Oh, my goodness! What a fall
from grace!

00:38.250 --> 00:42.373
Katrina the HellKat Bash,
KO'd and it's all over.

00:42.375 --> 00:43.375
Just like that.

01:28.625 --> 01:29.542
Heavenly.

02:10.333 --> 02:11.333
Beautiful.

03:24.042 --> 03:25.748
Where you headed?

03:25.750 --> 03:26.583
You need a lift?

03:36.958 --> 03:37.833
How about a smoke?

03:40.542 --> 03:43.540
You know, the next town's
60 miles from here.

03:43.542 --> 03:46.833
They got a bus station there,
and a bar.

03:50.417 --> 03:51.540
Hey.

03:51.542 --> 03:54.498
I'm just tryin' to do
a good Samaritan here.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.042
I'm not planning on hurting ya.

03:57.667 --> 03:59.625
I'm not worried about you
hurting me.

04:00.792 --> 04:01.625
Then hop in.

04:03.042 --> 04:03.875
Or not.

04:30.417 --> 04:31.250
Heavenly.

04:33.167 --> 04:34.167
Beautiful, isn't it?

04:35.292 --> 04:38.333
The way everything just
disappears into the darkness.

04:45.542 --> 04:47.083
They say smoking's bad for you.

04:48.417 --> 04:49.248
But if that was true,

04:49.250 --> 04:51.375
why would the good Lord
have created tobacco?

04:57.583 --> 05:00.458
I say indulge in his intelligent
design.

05:04.917 --> 05:06.456
You smoke pot?

05:06.458 --> 05:08.248
You smell of pot.

05:08.250 --> 05:09.417
I got a nose for that.

05:11.833 --> 05:13.790
You like cigarettes.

05:13.792 --> 05:15.248
I bet you like booze.

05:15.250 --> 05:17.875
Yeah, people say I got a sixth
sense.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.748
You're passin' through.

05:20.750 --> 05:21.583
Where you headed?

05:23.250 --> 05:24.250
I'm not sure.

05:25.375 --> 05:26.208
Somewhere.

05:27.375 --> 05:29.456
You're already somewhere,
sister.

05:29.458 --> 05:30.623
Somewhere.

05:30.625 --> 05:32.290
Anywhere.

05:32.292 --> 05:34.831
♪ Doesn't really matter ♪

05:34.833 --> 05:38.040
♪ 'Cause his righteous
hands are always there ♪

05:38.042 --> 05:41.540
♪ To help you up the ladder ♪

05:41.542 --> 05:42.873
That's one of mine.

05:42.875 --> 05:44.792
I wrote a few songs, sermons and
sets.

05:45.708 --> 05:47.373
That's really interesting.

05:47.375 --> 05:50.000
Just using my talents
to further his work.

05:52.250 --> 05:54.375
You ever heard of the prosperity
gospel?

05:55.792 --> 05:57.375
- Nope.
- Oh, sure you have.

05:58.458 --> 06:00.998
If you give a little to the
ministry,

06:01.000 --> 06:02.542
you get a lot from the Lord.

06:03.375 --> 06:05.415
Don't ask why. It's a miracle.

06:05.417 --> 06:07.917
Jesus wants you to have
abundance.

06:09.875 --> 06:11.125
Prosperity gospel.

06:12.167 --> 06:13.167
That was my idea.

06:14.583 --> 06:15.958
They stole it from me.

06:17.500 --> 06:19.042
I even designed a coin.

06:20.167 --> 06:21.208
Limited edition.

06:22.292 --> 06:24.665
On one side, you had Jesus,

06:24.667 --> 06:29.667
and on the other, you had
an AR-15 rifle and an eagle,

06:29.917 --> 06:32.292
all wrapped up in the stars and
stripes.

06:33.292 --> 06:36.125
That majestic bird, staring up
to heaven.

06:37.625 --> 06:40.333
How much do you think people
would give for that coin?

06:41.333 --> 06:44.583
Pass it down on their deathbed,
clutch it to their chest.

06:46.125 --> 06:48.331
God knows.

06:48.333 --> 06:49.706
Exactly.

06:49.708 --> 06:51.373
You got a quick wit.

06:51.375 --> 06:53.665
Can I get an Amen?

06:53.667 --> 06:56.498
I'll pass.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.708
Am I annoying you yet?

07:01.750 --> 07:03.792
Now where did you get that scar?

07:04.833 --> 07:06.081
What scar?

07:06.083 --> 07:08.833
Oh, the one between
the wings on your neck.

07:15.250 --> 07:16.625
Did I touch a nerve, sister?

07:54.208 --> 07:55.292
Thanks for the ride.

07:58.167 --> 08:00.000
Now hold on a second,
sister.

08:02.542 --> 08:03.500
Unlock the door.

08:04.625 --> 08:06.875
But wouldn't you like
a smoke for the road?

08:07.875 --> 08:10.456
Unlock the door.

08:12.042 --> 08:15.373
But I've been looking for
you everywhere, Katrina Bash.

08:15.375 --> 08:17.583
And hallelujah, I've found you.

08:24.458 --> 08:25.458
Oh, you like guns?

10:18.792 --> 10:19.958
Destination?

10:24.875 --> 10:27.083
Where can I get to for 80
bucks?

10:28.208 --> 10:29.958
A lot of places better than
here.

10:34.167 --> 10:37.125
When you know where you're
going, I'm right here.

10:39.042 --> 10:40.081
Mine it is.

10:40.083 --> 10:41.833
A rather good choice.

10:43.042 --> 10:43.958
Ladies night!

11:00.583 --> 11:02.248
Fuck everyone else.

11:32.958 --> 11:35.167
You know, non-alcohol beer...

11:42.042 --> 11:44.500
Is worse for you than alcoholic
beer.

11:45.667 --> 11:47.250
It's full of additives and shit.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.542
It's like cancer in a glass.

12:00.875 --> 12:02.831
What can I get ya?

12:02.833 --> 12:03.708
Water.

12:19.083 --> 12:19.915
You're in luck.

12:19.917 --> 12:21.750
No charge for water on ladies
night.

12:23.250 --> 12:24.583
I'd prefer tequila.

12:26.917 --> 12:28.542
Except, I don't have any money.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.667
Just another no-good drifter!

12:35.458 --> 12:39.125
I'd buy you a drink, but I
don't need a handjob tonight.

12:40.917 --> 12:43.831
Besides, you stink.

12:43.833 --> 12:46.417
You smell like an ashtray
in a kitty litter box.

13:06.625 --> 13:08.042
Fuck sake, man.

13:18.625 --> 13:20.958
How do you feel about vomit?

13:22.667 --> 13:24.208
And urine.

13:25.417 --> 13:27.125
Bodily fluids in general.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.583
I'll stick with water.

13:30.917 --> 13:31.831
You clean that up,

13:31.833 --> 13:34.831
and I'll fill your glass
to the brim with tequila.

13:34.833 --> 13:37.375
And I'll keep it coming. You
drink as much as you want.

13:41.250 --> 13:43.958
And you can stay the night
in the drunk tank out back.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.623
Oh, drunk tank.

13:46.625 --> 13:47.998
Sounds heavenly.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.792
Well, it's more of a shed,
really.

13:50.875 --> 13:52.665
Little service we offer
for those who wanna

13:52.667 --> 13:54.417
get away from the wife for a
while.

13:56.042 --> 13:57.083
It's vacant tonight.

13:58.667 --> 14:00.167
Unless you're too good for it?

14:01.000 --> 14:02.625
I'm not too good for anything.

14:05.500 --> 14:06.583
Throw in two packs.

14:14.458 --> 14:15.998
I tell ya.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.208
Cans are usually more disgusting
tonight.

14:26.333 --> 14:27.250
Deal's a deal.

14:51.958 --> 14:53.458
Ain't exactly 100% Agave.

14:54.958 --> 14:57.417
More like squeezed out
demapo from Tijuana.

14:58.375 --> 14:59.875
As long it helps me forget.

15:00.917 --> 15:02.208
Another one, please.

18:13.458 --> 18:14.375
You like boxing?

18:20.417 --> 18:23.290
Used to.

18:23.292 --> 18:24.540
Don't suppose you've expanded

18:24.542 --> 18:27.165
your tequila selection since
last night?

18:27.167 --> 18:28.000
Nope.

18:28.917 --> 18:30.042
Stayin' another night?

18:31.125 --> 18:32.042
Probably.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.415
You gonna clean up again at
close?

18:34.417 --> 18:36.790
That's the plan.

18:36.792 --> 18:38.583
Can't get any worse than last
night.

18:53.875 --> 18:56.875
So, what's the next move,
drifter?

18:58.458 --> 19:00.748
I don't have any more moves.

19:00.750 --> 19:02.333
Drink herself to death!

19:03.708 --> 19:04.542
That'll work.

19:08.542 --> 19:10.375
Barkeep, could I get an ashtray?

19:13.500 --> 19:14.833
What a clueless bitch.

19:17.042 --> 19:18.750
You can't drink yourself to
death.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.123
If you're already dead.

19:24.542 --> 19:26.500
Oh, you must be some
brain-damaged hoe.

19:27.417 --> 19:29.873
Oh, we've all got a little hoe
in us,

19:29.875 --> 19:31.165
and we're all on our way to
death.

19:31.167 --> 19:33.042
Barkeep, can you hit me again,
please?

19:37.708 --> 19:39.331
Barkeep.

19:39.333 --> 19:41.042
How do you make a lesbian
vampire?

19:43.000 --> 19:45.248
We don't do that kinda
trendy shit. You know that.

19:45.250 --> 19:46.542
Nothin' trendy about it.

19:47.417 --> 19:48.956
This is a timeless drink.

19:48.958 --> 19:50.083
Highball glass.

19:51.042 --> 19:53.040
Don't bother washing
it from the last drunk.

19:53.042 --> 19:55.123
Just wipe it with a dirty rag.

19:55.125 --> 19:57.540
Two shots little raw whiskey.

19:57.542 --> 19:59.581
Two shots Russian piss vodka.

19:59.583 --> 20:00.417
And the rest?

20:01.375 --> 20:02.625
Mad Dog, Ripple.

20:03.500 --> 20:06.123
Whatever wino shit you
can get from the gutter.

20:06.125 --> 20:07.706
And no ice.

20:07.708 --> 20:08.833
That's for faggots.

20:12.750 --> 20:13.583
Then...

20:15.458 --> 20:18.542
You cut some part of the body.

20:19.792 --> 20:20.625
Your body.

20:22.833 --> 20:24.748
Somebody else's body.

20:24.750 --> 20:25.583
Doesn't matter.

20:26.750 --> 20:31.750
Then you drip, drip, drip
the blood in.

20:32.375 --> 20:33.292
That's the cherry.

20:34.625 --> 20:37.917
The coup de grace, like the
frogs say.

20:39.083 --> 20:40.458
You forgot the umbrella.

20:41.500 --> 20:42.458
What did you say?

20:45.833 --> 20:49.915
I said, you're a
mouth-breathing knuckle-dragger.

20:49.917 --> 20:51.498
- What?
- Ah!

20:51.500 --> 20:53.208
And a deaf-mute, too.

20:54.250 --> 20:56.290
Get outta here before you get
hurt.

20:56.292 --> 20:57.917
Before who gets
hurt?

20:59.792 --> 21:03.208
Time to go, Viper.

21:08.458 --> 21:12.498
There ain't no such thing
as a vampire cocktail.

21:12.500 --> 21:14.833
You shut your beak,
you waste-of-life boozer.

21:15.833 --> 21:16.667
Worthless drunk.

21:18.542 --> 21:20.498
They say it's a disease!

21:20.500 --> 21:22.000
You're a fuckin' disease.

21:25.583 --> 21:27.292
What're you gonna do about it,
bitch?

21:28.792 --> 21:29.917
Some vigilante shit?

21:30.792 --> 21:31.873
I don't think so.

21:47.833 --> 21:49.415
Hit the road, Viper.

21:49.417 --> 21:50.750
That's enough for tonight.

21:53.500 --> 21:55.415
You get rid of one worthless
drunk,

21:55.417 --> 21:57.625
another one pops up
right back in his place.

21:58.750 --> 21:59.958
Right, Cucaracha?

22:01.500 --> 22:02.875
Look at me, you dumb broad!

22:04.667 --> 22:06.417
We're gonna match now, sister,
see.

22:12.708 --> 22:14.415
Like I said.

22:14.417 --> 22:17.456
You're already dead, HellKat.

22:17.458 --> 22:19.290
Started from the bottom?

22:19.292 --> 22:20.375
Welcome back.

22:22.625 --> 22:23.500
See you soon.

22:50.792 --> 22:51.625
Again.

23:23.375 --> 23:24.792
What the hell?

23:30.042 --> 23:31.292
Closing time, drifter.

23:33.917 --> 23:36.665
Okay, what is this?

23:36.667 --> 23:38.540
What is what?

23:38.542 --> 23:39.625
Two moons.

23:42.500 --> 23:43.917
Maybe tequila moons.

23:47.625 --> 23:50.667
I think you've got something
to tell me.

23:52.333 --> 23:53.625
Wish I could, kitty cat.

23:55.458 --> 23:56.417
It's not my job.

23:57.917 --> 23:59.958
Okay, what is going on here?

24:00.958 --> 24:02.792
You all know me, I don't know
you.

24:04.833 --> 24:05.667
What's your name?

24:07.667 --> 24:08.750
I don't have a name.

24:10.208 --> 24:11.208
I'm just a barkeep.

24:57.792 --> 25:00.081
Basements don't need cleaning.

25:00.083 --> 25:01.375
Just the bathrooms.

25:25.792 --> 25:27.665
What the hell?

25:39.833 --> 25:41.417
You do good cleaning work.

25:42.417 --> 25:43.250
Right.

25:45.792 --> 25:47.373
Tequila?

25:48.667 --> 25:50.917
You sure can drink,
but last call's over.

25:52.792 --> 25:55.498
I'm not permitted to serve after
closing.

25:55.500 --> 25:56.998
Seriously?

25:57.000 --> 25:59.706
Our deal was I drink whenever I
want.

25:59.708 --> 26:01.706
Not after closing.

26:01.708 --> 26:03.331
Well, isn't this your bar?

26:03.333 --> 26:05.540
- No.
- Well, who owns it then?

26:05.542 --> 26:07.790
I do.

26:07.792 --> 26:10.583
I own your entire world now,
Katrina.

26:14.708 --> 26:17.665
Party's about to begin, HellKat.

26:17.667 --> 26:18.500
Are you ready?

26:37.083 --> 26:39.415
And in the
blue corner, the challenger.

26:39.417 --> 26:41.998
Fighting out of Albuquerque, New
Mexico,

26:42.000 --> 26:44.998
the number one ranked women's
middleweight in the world,

26:45.000 --> 26:47.500
Katrina Bash HellKat!

27:00.958 --> 27:03.081
Oh, look.

27:03.083 --> 27:04.958
How bewitching the moons are
tonight.

27:09.500 --> 27:12.998
You know, you can
tell a lot about a person

27:13.000 --> 27:14.417
by what's in their backpack.

27:17.750 --> 27:19.290
Dope?

27:19.292 --> 27:20.417
Or is it catnip?

27:22.167 --> 27:23.000
Meow.

27:25.292 --> 27:27.542
Oh, look. She's a reader.

27:28.458 --> 27:31.373
Probably that
prosperity gospel shit.

27:31.375 --> 27:33.165
Look at this butch-ass wallet.

27:33.167 --> 27:34.208
What do we have here?

27:37.500 --> 27:38.792
Broke-ass bitch.

27:45.625 --> 27:48.042
Look at this little faggot.

28:22.375 --> 28:24.375
Katrina, are you okay?

28:27.542 --> 28:28.958
Hello, HellKat.

28:39.458 --> 28:42.625
I'd offer you cigarette,
but this is my last one.

28:44.042 --> 28:45.083
The fuck is that?

28:47.458 --> 28:50.417
Evening, kids.

28:51.917 --> 28:52.831
What're you staring at?

28:52.833 --> 28:54.958
You got something on
your shirt, Dominus.

28:56.208 --> 28:57.042
Pocket.

29:01.667 --> 29:04.331
Now the party really has
started.

29:04.333 --> 29:07.542
We even got hors d'oeuvres.

29:15.292 --> 29:17.123
Mm.

29:17.125 --> 29:20.165
Just like an oyster,
except for the aftertaste.

29:21.500 --> 29:22.792
Better than liver, though.

29:23.792 --> 29:27.167
My momma used to make us eat
liver every Friday night.

29:28.625 --> 29:31.083
'Cause that weren't meat,
see, that was an organ,

29:32.000 --> 29:36.081
and I used to keep it
balled up in my cheek.

29:36.083 --> 29:39.417
Looked like a little chipmunk.

29:40.917 --> 29:43.248
And I'd run round the back of
the house,

29:43.250 --> 29:45.665
and I'd spit it in the lake.

29:45.667 --> 29:47.333
Till one day, she caught me.

29:49.250 --> 29:51.331
And then I learned to love
liver.

29:51.333 --> 29:55.000
I learned to love all organs.

29:56.833 --> 29:57.792
Let's play a game.

29:59.542 --> 30:02.831
It's called whoever wins the
fight,

30:02.833 --> 30:05.456
gets to leave the bar alive.

30:05.458 --> 30:09.456
It's a catchy title, isn't it?

30:09.458 --> 30:11.167
You ever seen one of these
before?

30:12.208 --> 30:14.873
Ah, it's enchanting.

30:14.875 --> 30:18.167
Whoever says the magic word gets
it.

30:37.833 --> 30:39.456
Get up, bitch.

30:39.458 --> 30:40.292
Hit me!

30:41.125 --> 30:43.081
Fucking hit me!

30:51.958 --> 30:56.958
Why, that's quite the
statement.

30:57.542 --> 30:59.915
I should kill you.

30:59.917 --> 31:00.792
Kill me?

31:02.042 --> 31:03.958
Oh, you're fuckin' high, sister.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.083
And not on life.

31:07.083 --> 31:09.667
Let's not spend any more
valuable time together.

31:12.875 --> 31:14.292
Keep your distance.

31:16.750 --> 31:19.042
What kind of a mother are you
anyway?

31:23.250 --> 31:27.206
The kind who doesn't give
a shit about her own son.

31:27.208 --> 31:28.833
Leaves him to die.

31:30.250 --> 31:34.708
A narcissist who put her
career in front of her family.

31:36.458 --> 31:40.708
If you could call that
a career, or a family.

31:41.917 --> 31:47.123
Just feels like a pathetic
waste of space to me.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.540
You made it to the big leagues,

31:51.542 --> 31:54.208
but you couldn't close the deal,
could ya?

31:55.542 --> 31:59.540
And what a heavy price
you paid for failure.

32:01.833 --> 32:03.042
I can't remember.

32:04.292 --> 32:09.250
Have I complemented you on
your neck tattoo?

32:39.583 --> 32:41.956
Do you need a hug?

32:47.792 --> 32:48.625
Atonement.

32:49.833 --> 32:52.125
Oh, how sweet the sound.

32:53.042 --> 32:55.792
"If I could just have another
chance!"

33:01.542 --> 33:05.915
Well, here you are.

33:05.917 --> 33:07.083
Look familiar?

33:08.625 --> 33:11.792
You have no idea.

33:13.167 --> 33:16.248
Keep watchin'.

33:16.250 --> 33:19.831
It's better if you get it in
the full-screen experience.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.833
You gettin' it now?

34:37.792 --> 34:40.542
You might need one of these
when you hear the next bit.

34:49.833 --> 34:51.623
I quit.

34:51.625 --> 34:52.790
Oh.

34:52.792 --> 34:54.167
Congratulations.

34:55.250 --> 34:57.292
Too bad you didn't do it
earlier, though.

34:58.292 --> 35:00.875
'Cause you left one
smoldering in the ashtray.

35:02.458 --> 35:04.000
Burned the whole motel down.

35:05.417 --> 35:07.125
Killed an entire family.

35:08.042 --> 35:09.248
Mommy.

35:09.250 --> 35:10.706
Daddy.

35:10.708 --> 35:12.456
Baby girl.

35:12.458 --> 35:14.165
A little kiddie, too.

35:15.583 --> 35:17.000
Oh, the irony.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.665
See, you can't help it, Katrina.

35:20.667 --> 35:24.042
You destroy everything you
touch.

35:25.625 --> 35:27.706
They were just poor white trash
anyway,

35:27.708 --> 35:31.331
so nobody gave a shit.

35:31.333 --> 35:33.000
Back to more important things.

35:34.167 --> 35:36.956
Like what the hell is going on
here.

35:36.958 --> 35:39.373
Just hold your horses, little
lady.

35:39.375 --> 35:43.375
All I need from you is
a digital signature,

35:44.375 --> 35:47.167
and I'll let the cat out of the
bag.

35:48.125 --> 35:51.333
If we can find the will.

35:55.750 --> 35:56.542
What can I do?

35:59.042 --> 36:01.542
The boy gets another
spin at the vida loca.

36:02.625 --> 36:06.125
All you have to do is put on a
good show.

36:12.500 --> 36:14.331
Self-correction.

36:14.333 --> 36:16.292
You gotta win the tournament.

36:17.583 --> 36:20.542
Old-school, O.G. UFC one.

36:21.500 --> 36:24.248
But I know you can do it,
HellKat.

36:24.250 --> 36:25.292
I'm a believer.

36:26.208 --> 36:29.917
There's a special place inside
me reserved for dark horses.

36:31.125 --> 36:32.625
I'll be looking out for you.

36:34.833 --> 36:39.456
So just stare your eyeball real
close into the screen there.

36:39.458 --> 36:41.290
Retina scan.

36:41.292 --> 36:43.917
State your full name, loud and
clear,

36:44.958 --> 36:46.458
and we'll call that a deal.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.333
Katrina Bash.

36:55.458 --> 36:56.917
Katrina Bashinski.

37:05.917 --> 37:09.958
Doesn't quite roll off the
tongue, does it?

40:40.792 --> 40:41.625
HellKat.

40:45.167 --> 40:46.000
HellKat!

40:48.792 --> 40:52.625
The proud are laid low
and the humble exalted!

41:10.292 --> 41:12.042
You're a bloody mess!

41:14.583 --> 41:15.915
Don't move!

41:15.917 --> 41:17.498
Almost done!

41:20.708 --> 41:23.331
- What the hell?
- Indeed!

41:35.167 --> 41:37.415
You won't feel a thing.

41:38.917 --> 41:42.248
Just kidding of course.

41:46.083 --> 41:48.917
Fixing you up for your next
fight!

41:56.208 --> 41:57.792
You can get up now.

42:10.625 --> 42:11.458
Gratitude?

42:13.542 --> 42:14.748
What about it?

42:14.750 --> 42:16.042
You should try it!

42:19.875 --> 42:21.415
You know where you are?

42:21.417 --> 42:23.331
She has no idea.

42:23.333 --> 42:25.375
I believe she does.

42:27.542 --> 42:28.458
I've gone crazy?

42:30.625 --> 42:31.458
Not yet.

42:33.583 --> 42:34.748
I'm in hell?

42:34.750 --> 42:35.792
Not quite.

42:37.458 --> 42:38.417
I'm starving?

42:39.542 --> 42:41.415
We have an infinite supply.

42:41.417 --> 42:43.623
Chips and jerky.

42:43.625 --> 42:45.583
What more could you want in
life?

42:52.375 --> 42:53.208
Fish!

42:57.792 --> 42:58.958
Are you ready?

43:03.500 --> 43:05.956
Are you gonna piss your pants?

43:09.583 --> 43:11.165
Oh.

43:11.167 --> 43:12.667
What a cliche.

43:14.625 --> 43:17.665
Glad I didn't ask if you
were shittin' yourself.

43:21.542 --> 43:25.083
You signed up for this, so
let's not make a biggie of it.

43:26.250 --> 43:28.792
- Who am I fighting?
- You mean what.

43:30.250 --> 43:32.956
- What?
- Yeah.

43:32.958 --> 43:34.667
What are you fightin'.

43:36.458 --> 43:38.792
A most charming critter, indeed.

43:40.292 --> 43:45.292
Because today's the day the
teddy bears have their picnic.

46:12.417 --> 46:13.250
No!

46:31.458 --> 46:33.748
What the fuck?

46:33.750 --> 46:34.583
What happened?

46:36.792 --> 46:39.915
Somebody won, somebody lost.

46:39.917 --> 46:42.248
What happens to somebody who
lost?

46:42.250 --> 46:43.540
That depends.

46:43.542 --> 46:48.206
If somebody is of the
nether, they cease to exist.

46:48.208 --> 46:51.081
If somebody is human,
they become of the nether.

46:51.083 --> 46:53.373
They become a fucking monster?

46:53.375 --> 46:55.498
Not that they are aware of.

46:55.500 --> 46:56.956
Oh, what a relief.

46:56.958 --> 46:59.206
You are here of your own
doings.

46:59.208 --> 47:02.623
Your actions brought you here.

47:02.625 --> 47:05.206
Be grateful you have one last
chance.

47:05.208 --> 47:08.458
And be thankful I'm here to help
you.

47:11.333 --> 47:12.750
Better warm up.

47:16.208 --> 47:17.667
By hitting that meat bag?

47:18.625 --> 47:21.500
How do you prepare for a
giant mother nether fuck?

47:22.625 --> 47:23.458
Lubricate.

47:24.625 --> 47:28.540
Try fuckin' this.

47:31.792 --> 47:33.250
Save your energy, sister.

47:34.667 --> 47:38.375
You're gonna need it and you're
beginning to piss me off.

47:43.167 --> 47:44.375
You're up in five.

47:45.792 --> 47:46.625
Lubricate.

47:54.125 --> 47:55.540
This is it.

47:55.542 --> 47:56.831
Fuck me.

47:56.833 --> 47:58.456
I'm done.

47:58.458 --> 47:59.998
You can do
this.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.206
No.

48:01.208 --> 48:02.456
It's over.

48:02.458 --> 48:03.625
I'm over.

48:04.583 --> 48:05.792
HellKat won her fight.

48:06.792 --> 48:08.790
If she can, you can win.

48:08.792 --> 48:10.290
We can win.

48:10.292 --> 48:11.915
This little shit won?

48:11.917 --> 48:12.915
How?

48:12.917 --> 48:16.873
All you think you know means
nothing.

48:16.875 --> 48:20.706
Ignore your mind, embrace your
spirit.

48:20.708 --> 48:21.873
Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.

48:21.875 --> 48:24.623
Everything that really
matters is right here.

48:24.625 --> 48:26.915
That's your heart!

48:26.917 --> 48:28.831
I said your spirit!

48:28.833 --> 48:30.706
What difference does it make?

48:30.708 --> 48:32.748
I'm fucked either way.

48:32.750 --> 48:35.208
Why the fuck do you think
I'm here to start with?

48:36.750 --> 48:38.375
What did you do to get put here?

48:40.958 --> 48:42.208
Do you know why I'm here?

48:43.792 --> 48:45.290
I don't need to know.

48:45.292 --> 48:47.750
You don't want to know.
Believe me.

48:49.333 --> 48:50.958
I am not fit to judge.

48:54.917 --> 48:56.415
And the only way I can save
myself

48:56.417 --> 48:58.706
is by fighting a fucking
monster?

48:58.708 --> 49:00.540
Everyone has their own path.

49:00.542 --> 49:02.623
Oh, spare the Buddha
bullshit. I'm fucked.

49:02.625 --> 49:04.040
- So we've heard!
- Fuck you!

49:04.042 --> 49:05.248
Calm down, Salt.

49:05.250 --> 49:06.540
You calm down!

49:06.542 --> 49:08.206
Shit!

49:08.208 --> 49:10.083
What are they gonna put in front
of me?

49:11.000 --> 49:13.165
What if it's something
I'm really scared of?

49:13.167 --> 49:14.665
They know everything about us.

49:14.667 --> 49:16.665
Our, our pasts, our nightmares.

49:16.667 --> 49:18.456
Okay look, just stop it, okay?

49:18.458 --> 49:19.956
Fuck off!

49:19.958 --> 49:21.373
Oh, my god.

49:21.375 --> 49:22.542
Not here.

49:24.208 --> 49:25.540
Why?

49:25.542 --> 49:26.540
Why?

49:26.542 --> 49:29.081
We all know why we're here.

49:29.083 --> 49:30.956
We've earned it!

49:30.958 --> 49:35.040
Now face it and do what you do
need to do.

49:35.042 --> 49:38.998
This is truly your last chance.

49:39.000 --> 49:40.081
Fuck!

49:40.083 --> 49:40.917
Jesus.

49:42.000 --> 49:45.415
Did somebody say "fuck Jesus?"

49:46.875 --> 49:49.331
Can I get an Amen?

49:55.292 --> 49:56.208
Can you hear that?

49:58.833 --> 49:59.958
What are they saying?

50:02.250 --> 50:03.625
"Kill the bitch."

50:05.000 --> 50:05.833
Let's go.

50:07.083 --> 50:08.915
I didn't know what I was
doing.

50:08.917 --> 50:11.373
It wasn't my fault. I was sick.

50:11.375 --> 50:12.581
What do they call it?

50:12.583 --> 50:14.000
Not guilty due to insanity.

50:15.458 --> 50:16.500
I don't deserve this.

50:19.167 --> 50:20.167
Yes, you do.

50:56.708 --> 50:57.542
Oh, no.

51:02.083 --> 51:04.831
You get your fuckin' ass in
there,

51:04.833 --> 51:07.042
or I'll send you straight to
hell.

51:08.667 --> 51:09.458
Get up.

51:32.542 --> 51:34.998
I'm sorry.

51:35.000 --> 51:36.998
I'm sorry for what I did.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.748
Oh, okay.

51:41.333 --> 51:45.250
All is forgiven then.

52:53.042 --> 52:54.206
Yes!

52:54.208 --> 52:55.123
Fuck yes!

52:55.125 --> 52:57.917
Now let me go. I want my reward,
you fuck.

52:59.667 --> 53:01.540
Here she is.

53:01.542 --> 53:02.706
Don't you look divine?

53:02.708 --> 53:05.165
Mm, Jimmy.

53:05.167 --> 53:06.292
Are you singing?

53:07.958 --> 53:10.373
Not yet.

53:18.875 --> 53:20.208
What the fuck?

53:48.167 --> 53:49.083
Oh, fuck.

53:56.000 --> 53:57.873
Ain't no way I'm gonna lose,
man.

54:00.208 --> 54:01.040
Ain't no way.

54:08.083 --> 54:09.083
Fuck this.

54:10.042 --> 54:15.165
There is eternity, there is
oblivion and there is hope.

54:15.167 --> 54:20.083
Where you end up, believe it
or not, is entirely up to you.

54:27.958 --> 54:30.292
Let's get ready to rumble!

54:36.750 --> 54:39.542
Whatever you are, I don't
care.

54:47.958 --> 54:51.333
You're really beginning
to piss me off, sister.

54:54.500 --> 54:56.000
You're up, big boy.

55:39.875 --> 55:41.831
Listen, before you go in,

55:41.833 --> 55:45.248
is there any way you could
lay down on this one?

55:45.250 --> 55:47.415
Because if you lose, we could do
a whole

55:47.417 --> 55:50.498
cat versus dog thing in the next
round.

55:50.500 --> 55:51.831
That's clever, right?

56:01.042 --> 56:04.081
Jimmy.

56:35.708 --> 56:37.373
Come on, big boy.

56:37.375 --> 56:38.623
Hit him!

56:38.625 --> 56:43.250
Hit him!

57:17.417 --> 57:20.083
Jimmy!

57:28.167 --> 57:29.000
Jimmy!

58:33.667 --> 58:38.748
Oh, fuck.

58:38.750 --> 58:40.581
He'll be fine.

58:40.583 --> 58:41.998
Get ready for the...

58:49.708 --> 58:51.998
Congratulations,
big boy.

58:52.000 --> 58:55.833
You beat the tomato can,
and with such style, too.

59:00.500 --> 59:02.250
You're up next, kit cat.

59:18.167 --> 59:19.875
Oh, do you like my boots?

59:21.000 --> 59:22.333
I'm flattered you noticed.

59:23.917 --> 59:25.540
They're very rare.

59:25.542 --> 59:28.623
Made of 100% human skin.

59:28.625 --> 59:31.248
Just the uppers, of course.

59:31.250 --> 59:33.292
They'd make a great present for
somebody.

59:34.292 --> 59:38.333
Unless you'd like a pair
for yourself.

1:02:08.792 --> 1:02:10.790
Holy Moses.

1:02:12.167 --> 1:02:13.415
I gotta tell ya.

1:02:13.417 --> 1:02:15.915
I can't wait for this next
fight.

1:02:15.917 --> 1:02:18.873
The crowd is so quiet with
anticipation down there,

1:02:18.875 --> 1:02:21.915
you could hear a rat piss in
Hong Kong.

1:02:23.250 --> 1:02:24.208
Are you ready?

1:02:25.875 --> 1:02:26.748
No.

1:02:26.750 --> 1:02:27.833
Well, get ready.

1:02:29.333 --> 1:02:31.040
One night only.

1:02:31.042 --> 1:02:33.123
Last man standing.

1:02:33.125 --> 1:02:35.290
John Hancock on the jotted line.

1:02:35.292 --> 1:02:36.790
Son of a bitch.

1:02:36.792 --> 1:02:38.248
Indeed.

1:02:38.250 --> 1:02:40.373
She was a bitch.

1:02:40.375 --> 1:02:43.998
Her specialty was drinking
and then she'd hit me

1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:46.208
with whatever she could get her
hands on.

1:02:47.292 --> 1:02:49.917
Took till the time came
for me to hit her back.

1:02:51.083 --> 1:02:53.375
And there began the yellow brick
road.

1:02:54.500 --> 1:02:55.417
And look at me now.

1:02:57.125 --> 1:02:58.331
I'm the wizard.

1:03:01.250 --> 1:03:02.583
Here we go, big boy.

1:03:04.458 --> 1:03:05.417
Gotta tell ya.

1:03:06.458 --> 1:03:08.167
I don't fancy your chances.

1:03:14.583 --> 1:03:18.873
No one saves us, but
ourselves.

1:03:18.875 --> 1:03:21.373
- What about God?
- God?

1:03:21.375 --> 1:03:23.581
God grants you free will!

1:03:23.583 --> 1:03:27.206
Your own mind, your own spirit,
yourself.

1:03:27.208 --> 1:03:30.665
Your being alone has the
power to enlighten you.

1:03:30.667 --> 1:03:34.125
Just as it may destroy you.

1:03:43.083 --> 1:03:43.917
What?

1:03:45.083 --> 1:03:46.706
What's that?

1:03:46.708 --> 1:03:48.581
Liquid God.

1:03:48.583 --> 1:03:49.417
Come here!

1:03:52.500 --> 1:03:53.915
Turn around!

1:03:53.917 --> 1:03:54.750
Trust me.

1:03:55.833 --> 1:03:57.581
This will help.

1:04:03.125 --> 1:04:04.540
Damn.

1:04:04.542 --> 1:04:06.540
That feels good.

1:04:06.542 --> 1:04:11.458
No matter what awaits you
below, believe you can prevail.

1:04:23.750 --> 1:04:24.583
Damn.

1:04:27.250 --> 1:04:28.540
Show time.

1:06:02.417 --> 1:06:03.790
Come!

1:06:03.792 --> 1:06:05.331
Let me work on you!

1:06:05.333 --> 1:06:06.167
No.

1:06:07.375 --> 1:06:08.750
- Come!
- I said, no!

1:06:10.125 --> 1:06:12.873
Then you will face the
repercussions.

1:06:12.875 --> 1:06:14.458
I'm done with this shit, man.

1:06:15.750 --> 1:06:18.331
You know why this is?

1:06:18.333 --> 1:06:19.167
Yes.

1:06:21.292 --> 1:06:25.415
You must atone to redeem
for what you have done.

1:06:25.417 --> 1:06:26.792
I know, shit!

1:06:31.167 --> 1:06:33.417
Sounds like someone needs a
reminder.

1:06:34.542 --> 1:06:35.375
Damn you.

1:06:38.583 --> 1:06:41.248
What about you, Katrina?

1:06:41.250 --> 1:06:42.292
What did you do?

1:06:46.250 --> 1:06:47.792
Cat got your tongue?

1:06:49.333 --> 1:06:50.125
Shut up.

1:06:51.917 --> 1:06:53.290
Mom of the year?

1:06:53.292 --> 1:06:54.375
Shut your mouth!

1:06:55.708 --> 1:06:57.081
What happened?

1:06:57.083 --> 1:06:58.956
Yeah, Katrina.

1:06:58.958 --> 1:07:00.206
What happened?

1:07:00.208 --> 1:07:01.042
You know.

1:07:03.583 --> 1:07:04.458
Is that it?

1:07:05.458 --> 1:07:07.831
Can we not have a bit more
color?

1:07:07.833 --> 1:07:12.125
Like, "don't leave mommy's
opiates lying around."

1:07:14.042 --> 1:07:17.250
But it goes with the
territory, doesn't it, HellKat?

1:07:18.875 --> 1:07:22.456
Blah, blah, blah. All this talk.

1:07:22.458 --> 1:07:24.708
We've gotta get on with the
grand finale.

1:07:25.917 --> 1:07:27.583
You're up, HellKat.

1:07:31.125 --> 1:07:33.208
And you too, big poppa pump.

1:07:43.083 --> 1:07:43.917
I won't do it.

1:07:45.542 --> 1:07:46.375
Me neither.

1:07:48.292 --> 1:07:49.708
Oh, yes, you will.

1:07:51.458 --> 1:07:54.542
You'll do anything to save your
boy.

1:07:58.750 --> 1:07:59.831
And you?

1:07:59.833 --> 1:08:02.790
Your wife and your brother.

1:08:04.625 --> 1:08:06.623
Your wife and your brother.

1:08:06.625 --> 1:08:11.042
That's some real trailer
park shit.

1:08:11.917 --> 1:08:12.750
Oh!

1:08:13.625 --> 1:08:18.665
"I'd do anything to
atone for my mistakes."

1:08:21.750 --> 1:08:22.583
Oh, yeah.

1:08:24.792 --> 1:08:25.667
You'll do it.

1:08:26.917 --> 1:08:29.583
I think you'll do just about
anything.

1:08:36.750 --> 1:08:38.331
Oh, no!

1:08:38.333 --> 1:08:40.873
A chainsaw!

1:08:40.875 --> 1:08:44.873
And here's me, sittin' on a
tree!

1:08:44.875 --> 1:08:48.790
You will be punished for your
anger!

1:08:48.792 --> 1:08:51.665
You will be punished by your
anger!

1:08:51.667 --> 1:08:55.415
Come on, then!

1:09:54.125 --> 1:09:55.458
What the hell?

1:10:02.375 --> 1:10:03.208
God damn it.

1:10:06.083 --> 1:10:07.790
Are you gettin' it now?

1:10:07.792 --> 1:10:09.500
This is my world!

1:10:11.167 --> 1:10:12.456
Time to fight.

1:10:25.917 --> 1:10:29.917
They're like two scorpions
in a bottle.

1:10:35.708 --> 1:10:37.250
Jimmy, why ain't they fighting?

1:10:38.500 --> 1:10:40.583
I think they need a bit of...

1:10:42.167 --> 1:10:43.000
Prodding.

1:10:44.375 --> 1:10:47.167
Yes, I think they do too.

1:11:19.833 --> 1:11:20.667
Matteo.

1:11:24.875 --> 1:11:25.708
Matteo?

1:14:10.542 --> 1:14:12.250
Come on, finish him.

1:14:16.333 --> 1:14:17.542
What're you waiting for?

1:14:19.792 --> 1:14:22.623
Kill him, Katrina.

1:14:22.625 --> 1:14:24.373
Kill the cock sucker!

1:14:24.375 --> 1:14:25.915
Shut up!

1:14:29.333 --> 1:14:30.167
This is it.

1:14:31.208 --> 1:14:32.458
Think of your son.

1:14:36.875 --> 1:14:39.292
I'll give you another chance.

1:14:40.500 --> 1:14:42.331
I'll make you a champion.

1:14:42.333 --> 1:14:44.917
Everybody will know who you are.

1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:47.415
You'll be a legend.

1:14:47.417 --> 1:14:51.875
Everybody will know the name of
HellKat.

1:15:05.500 --> 1:15:07.000
What're you doin'?

1:15:08.500 --> 1:15:09.333
Get up.

1:15:13.417 --> 1:15:16.417
Stand up and fight for your
soul!

1:15:18.458 --> 1:15:19.292
No.

1:15:20.917 --> 1:15:24.040
Fight me!

1:15:24.042 --> 1:15:25.625
No more fighting.

1:15:27.500 --> 1:15:30.000
Fight for your pathetic son!

1:15:33.958 --> 1:15:34.792
Then die!
