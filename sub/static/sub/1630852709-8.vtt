00:09.634 --> 00:11.594


00:11.678 --> 00:13.805


00:13.888 --> 00:15.015


00:23.815 --> 00:25.984


00:32.198 --> 00:34.325


00:34.409 --> 00:37.454


00:38.079 --> 00:40.498


00:41.750 --> 00:43.793


00:46.504 --> 00:47.630
Gah! Ha ha!

00:47.714 --> 00:48.631
Mine, mine!

00:48.715 --> 00:49.549
Ooh!

00:50.008 --> 00:50.925
-Whee!
-Uh!

00:51.009 --> 00:53.011
Uhh!

00:53.094 --> 00:54.971
Gah! Whoo-hoo!

00:55.054 --> 00:56.014
I got it!

00:56.097 --> 00:56.931
Whoa-ho!

00:57.599 --> 00:59.184
Heads up!

00:59.267 --> 01:01.269


01:03.688 --> 01:05.857
All right, everyone. This is--

01:05.940 --> 01:07.484
Uh…

01:07.567 --> 01:09.986
Penley, our newest camper.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.200
You okay? He looks a little green.

01:15.283 --> 01:17.535
Uh, duh, 'cause he's a pig.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.538
Stella, be nice!

01:20.622 --> 01:23.083
Don't listen to her.
She gets cranky when she loses.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.627
Especially at games
she rules at.

01:25.710 --> 01:28.505
No, he actually is a pig, Chuck.

01:28.588 --> 01:29.839
Oh, is he?

01:29.923 --> 01:32.759
Ah. Well, all you young people
look the same to me.

01:32.842 --> 01:34.427
Wait, you're just gonna leave him?

01:34.511 --> 01:36.471
How's he gonna figure out
how things work here?

01:36.554 --> 01:39.641
That's why I'm leaving him
in your capable wings.

01:39.724 --> 01:41.476
But shouldn't he be at Pig Camp?

01:41.559 --> 01:43.853
Oh, definitely, but you know how it is.

01:43.937 --> 01:46.231
Paperwork snafu. Yada yada.
Check already cleared.

01:46.314 --> 01:48.066
Have fun! Toodle-oo!

01:48.983 --> 01:51.152
"Ooh! Look at me. I'm Lynette.

01:51.236 --> 01:55.073
I don't care what happens to anyone
as long as it makes my life easier."

01:56.199 --> 01:57.867
I heard that!

01:57.951 --> 02:00.453
Anyway.
Hello!

02:00.537 --> 02:01.996
I'm Stella!

02:02.080 --> 02:04.499
This is Red, Bomb, and Chuck.

02:07.252 --> 02:09.087
Um, anyone know what he said?

02:09.170 --> 02:12.132
Stand back. I did a semester
of pig latin back home.

02:19.889 --> 02:20.849
Yeah, I got nothin'.

02:20.932 --> 02:23.268
Don't worry, Penley.
You're gonna love it here.

02:23.351 --> 02:25.854
Yeah, there's something for everyone
at Camp Splinterwood.

02:25.937 --> 02:28.106
Stick with us and we'll figure out
what your thing is.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.151
-Ooh.

02:31.234 --> 02:33.945
But first, my thing. Lunch!

02:34.904 --> 02:36.531
You know, eating?

02:40.118 --> 02:42.829
This is the fastest way to get around.

02:42.912 --> 02:44.038
Fun, right?

02:44.122 --> 02:46.166
Just relax. You'll get the hang of it.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.672
-See? Having a great time already.

02:56.718 --> 02:57.594
Whoo, yeah!

02:57.677 --> 02:58.761
-Whoo-hoo!
-Hee-hee!

02:58.845 --> 02:59.846
Whoo hoo hoo!

03:04.642 --> 03:06.728
So, Penley, what looks good to you?

03:14.527 --> 03:17.113
He's eating garbage? Who does that?

03:17.614 --> 03:19.782
Here, try this.

03:22.827 --> 03:26.331
Well, this is how most of us
eat around here, Penley.

03:32.211 --> 03:33.129
Wanna try it?

03:35.632 --> 03:37.967
If you're not gonna finish that,
mind if I--

03:38.051 --> 03:39.427
Whoo!

03:48.102 --> 03:51.397
What the-- Ohh. You better
clean that up, whoever you--

03:51.481 --> 03:54.484
Well, what do we have here?

03:54.567 --> 03:56.986
Uh-oh. Trouble. Twelve o'clock.

03:57.779 --> 04:00.073
Look, uh, piggy,

04:00.156 --> 04:02.909
I'm kind of the king of camp
and you're new around here,

04:02.992 --> 04:04.619
so I'll let you make it up to me by--

04:10.250 --> 04:12.460
Okay… heh.

04:12.543 --> 04:14.629
I was thinking you could, like,
give me your fruit cup or something,

04:14.712 --> 04:16.089
but this'll do.

04:16.631 --> 04:19.634
Yes. This'll do nicely.

04:19.717 --> 04:21.427
Hey, Penley, buddy.

04:21.511 --> 04:24.597
Let's try to avoid
any unnecessary jerks, okay?

04:24.681 --> 04:27.058
That was uncalled for. I was just--

04:27.141 --> 04:28.768
Taking advantage of him.

04:28.851 --> 04:32.563
Well, you have your way of making friends.
I have mine.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.524
See you around, new pig.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.361
Ta-ta!

04:38.987 --> 04:41.406
Word of advice, watch out for Neiderjerk.

04:41.489 --> 04:45.326
Otherwise, you'll be doing what he wants
and not what you want.

04:45.410 --> 04:48.204
Speaking of, we have
to figure out what that is.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.540
Okay, time for the grand tour.

04:50.623 --> 04:52.792
First stop, basketbird.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.887
Okay, not the sporty type.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.849
-Fine. Let's try… the slide!

05:09.267 --> 05:11.019
This is the one. I know it.

05:18.276 --> 05:21.654
-He stopped screaming. He must like it.

05:29.078 --> 05:30.079
Whew!

05:36.210 --> 05:38.671
Hey, that looked fun. Can I go next?

05:40.256 --> 05:43.051
Okay, Penley. This is it for sure.

05:43.134 --> 05:45.762
The dojo. Uh-- Hey, where'd he go?

05:50.975 --> 05:53.186
Not too shabby,
new pig.

05:53.269 --> 05:54.854
Hot tub room, check.

05:54.937 --> 05:57.815
Now, let's get started
on that worm juice cellar.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.318
Neiderjerk! Penley's here to have fun,

06:00.401 --> 06:04.322
not waste his time on your stupid
construction projects! Argh!

06:04.405 --> 06:07.408
We'll take our friend back,
if you don't mind.

06:08.117 --> 06:09.786
Sure thing, Rod!

06:09.869 --> 06:12.246
Hey, when you get tired of these losers,

06:12.330 --> 06:15.041
you know where to find me! Ta-ta!

06:15.625 --> 06:19.587
Now, back to finding your thing,
and my money's on canoeing.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.469
Okay, we tried archery, Dodgebird,

06:26.552 --> 06:29.305
arts and crafts, the rope course,
and hatchling whack-a-mole,

06:29.388 --> 06:32.433
but there's one thing we haven't tried--
this place.

06:39.482 --> 06:42.151
Actually, Penley, I have zero idea
what's happening here.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.778
Hey, where'd Penley go?

06:43.861 --> 06:48.825
I guess Camp Splinterwood has something
for everyone… except Penley.

06:48.908 --> 06:52.537
I promised we'd help him find his thing,
and I blew it.

06:52.620 --> 06:55.706
Don't be so hard on yourself, Red.
That's my job.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.750
But yeah, you totally blew it.

07:01.087 --> 07:02.630
Huh! Well, that's new.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.093
Penley, why do you keep
wandering off to build stuff

07:07.176 --> 07:09.595
instead of helping us figure out
what you love to do?

07:09.679 --> 07:12.306
Oh, man. We're so dumb.

07:12.390 --> 07:13.599
Hey, speak for myself!

07:13.683 --> 07:17.103
I know what Penley's thing is.
Isn't it obvious, guys?

07:19.230 --> 07:22.108
Well, duh, totally obvious.

07:22.191 --> 07:23.609
But, uh, you say it first.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.403
You like building stuff!

07:25.486 --> 07:27.864
Building stuff. I knew it. I said it, too.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.034
See? I knew he'd figure it out.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.162
And you're really great at it.

07:34.245 --> 07:36.747
This takes the slide to a whole new level.

07:37.623 --> 07:40.626
It goes through the dining hall,
over the basketbird court…

07:40.710 --> 07:42.462
Through Lynette's office.

07:42.545 --> 07:46.257
And finishes up sending
all the campers flying out right into--

07:46.340 --> 07:47.967
Wait, that's our cabin!

07:48.050 --> 07:50.261
It's totally gonna be destroyed!

07:51.345 --> 07:54.015
<i>Attention Camp Splinterwood!</i>

07:54.098 --> 07:56.934
<i>Hello, little people-- I mean, friends.</i>

07:57.018 --> 07:58.936
<i>Thanks to Yours Truly,</i>

07:59.020 --> 08:02.023
<i>there's now a totally awesome addition</i>
<i>to the big slide!</i>

08:02.106 --> 08:05.318
Neiderflyer! Neiderflyer!
Neiderflyer! Neiderflyer!

08:05.401 --> 08:08.613
Ah, the one you should
really be cheering for is--

08:08.696 --> 08:12.325
Well, yes, me,
for getting the new pig to build it.

08:12.408 --> 08:14.577
You're the bird, Neiderflyer!

08:14.660 --> 08:15.828
I know, I know.

08:15.912 --> 08:18.581
Though, while I selflessly
did this for you,

08:18.664 --> 08:23.085
an added bonus is that it's
going to completely destroy Rod's cabin.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.546
Whoa, bro. That's cold.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.425
You didn't know, did you?

08:29.509 --> 08:31.052
-Don't worry.

08:31.135 --> 08:32.261
We can fix this.

08:32.345 --> 08:35.765
Yeah! 'Cause we have the best builder
in all of Camp Splinterwood.

08:41.812 --> 08:43.439
Ah. Eek! Uhh.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.571
Hey, wait a minute.
What are we doing again?

08:50.655 --> 08:53.199
We're building a new section of slide
to stick at the end

08:53.282 --> 08:56.327
and reroute the campers before they
smash our cabin to smithereens.

08:56.410 --> 08:57.995
Ohh…

08:58.079 --> 09:00.957
-Well, then what are we waiting for?
-Uh, we're not.

09:02.625 --> 09:05.044
That's it. Ram in!

09:05.127 --> 09:08.130
The more the merrier,
and the more damage it'll do.

09:08.714 --> 09:09.632
Yeow!

09:20.601 --> 09:22.103
Oh, boy!

09:24.146 --> 09:25.690
Whoa-whah!

09:27.358 --> 09:28.192
Yeah!

09:30.695 --> 09:33.030
Almost showtime.

09:34.699 --> 09:37.243
Oh no! They're coming.

09:41.330 --> 09:42.999
In three…

09:45.751 --> 09:47.295
-Two…

09:49.171 --> 09:50.047
One.

09:56.971 --> 09:57.847
Uh-oh.

10:03.561 --> 10:06.856
My hot tub!

10:09.525 --> 10:12.278
Noooo!

10:13.112 --> 10:15.197
Yeah! We did it!

10:15.281 --> 10:17.199
You saved our bunk, Penley!

10:17.283 --> 10:21.370
Which makes it as much yours as ours,
if you want to join us, bunkie.

10:22.580 --> 10:26.125
Hey! You never called me bunkie before.

10:28.794 --> 10:32.923
Ah, Penley… where have you
and this hot tub been all my life?

10:33.007 --> 10:35.509
Chuckieball!

10:39.972 --> 10:40.890
What?
