00:28.895 --> 00:31.655
Sophie!

00:31.697 --> 00:34.758
Is that you? Hey.

00:35.271 --> 00:37.620
It's Emma from the Give an Hour 5K.

00:37.662 --> 00:40.310
- Sheri introduced us.
- Ah, sorry. I...

00:40.352 --> 00:41.872
I met a lot of people that day.

00:41.914 --> 00:43.808
Yeah, i-it was quick, but

00:43.850 --> 00:47.882
I was just so moved by
your family's story.

00:48.404 --> 00:50.417
Sheri filled me in a little bit

00:50.459 --> 00:52.488
a-about what you guys
have been going through.

00:52.797 --> 00:56.488
Well, I was pregnant when
I lost my husband, too,

00:56.530 --> 00:57.855
just like your mom.

00:57.897 --> 01:01.060
- I'm so sorry.
- That's okay. It was a long time ago.

01:01.102 --> 01:02.611
But thank you.

01:03.007 --> 01:05.373
How is she, your mom?

01:05.847 --> 01:08.155
Some days are better than others.

01:09.177 --> 01:10.643
Well, if you think it might help for her

01:10.685 --> 01:12.919
to have someone to talk
to who's been through it,

01:12.961 --> 01:14.965
um, I'd be happy to.

01:15.007 --> 01:17.027
Yeah, I'm sure she'd really like that.

01:17.069 --> 01:19.863
- Is she around now?
- She just left.

01:19.905 --> 01:22.754
Oh, shoot. Well, I'll tell you what.

01:22.796 --> 01:24.503
- M-Maybe I could leave her a note.
- Yeah.

01:24.545 --> 01:26.178
I don't have a pen.

01:26.220 --> 01:27.575
Oh, well, I can grab one.

01:27.617 --> 01:29.353
- Oh, you don't have to do that.
- No, no, no. I-It's fine.

01:29.395 --> 01:31.030
- Yeah? All right.
- Come on.

01:39.382 --> 01:41.414
You know, if you would've
been here two minutes ago,

01:41.456 --> 01:43.142
you would've seen her.

01:43.560 --> 01:45.811
You all look so happy.

01:48.361 --> 01:51.148
I'll go get a pen.

02:08.500 --> 02:10.252
No, anything for Maggie.

02:10.294 --> 02:12.200
I just wish we could be there.

02:12.242 --> 02:14.575
Here's the lasagna.

02:15.123 --> 02:18.534
Please promise me
you'll text us updates.

02:18.576 --> 02:20.550
I just wish we could be there with you.

02:20.592 --> 02:23.148
Yes, lots and lots of text updates.

02:23.190 --> 02:25.984
She loves Regina's lasagna.
It's a new thing.

02:26.026 --> 02:28.871
Oh, hey, Mom, there's
somebody here to see you.

02:28.913 --> 02:31.544
I met her outside. She
said she's from the 5K.

02:31.586 --> 02:34.560
Hey, Emma, uh, my mom's back if you...

02:36.119 --> 02:37.806
She's gone.

02:38.847 --> 02:40.545
That's weird.

02:43.718 --> 02:48.312
- Synced and corrected by <font color="#009BCB"><b>chamallow</b></font>/<b><font color="#ff0000">btsix</font></b> -
- www.addic7ed.com -

02:48.354 --> 02:50.310
And this is a consent for
a blood transfusion,

02:50.352 --> 02:52.305
- should the need arises.
- Which it won't.

02:52.347 --> 02:55.364
- She still needs to sign the form.
- I understand.

02:55.855 --> 02:57.421
Okay. You're all set.

02:57.463 --> 02:59.044
We'll be in shortly to
take you to the O.R.

02:59.086 --> 03:00.451
We'll be here.

03:01.326 --> 03:03.724
You canceled Pilates, right?

03:03.766 --> 03:05.140
Don't worry about her.

03:05.182 --> 03:06.814
Compared to your mastectomy,
this is nothing.

03:06.856 --> 03:08.293
- This is child's play.
- Yeah.

03:08.335 --> 03:09.726
Lymph nodes? Come on.

03:09.768 --> 03:12.359
May as well be taking out my tonsils.

03:14.247 --> 03:17.508
Um, hey, um, could you
grab the Post-It notes

03:17.550 --> 03:19.957
so I can write down my parents'
number so you can update them?

03:19.999 --> 03:21.412
Oh, you don't have to do
that. We'll just call 'em

03:21.454 --> 03:23.450
when you get out of surgery.
You can give me their number

03:23.492 --> 03:24.910
when you wake up.

03:27.488 --> 03:30.765
Ye... I might be groggy.

03:31.238 --> 03:33.490
You might be a little groggy.

03:37.913 --> 03:39.961
Ugh, the rosary.

03:40.003 --> 03:43.080
I'm sorry. It sounded like
you said "the rosary."

03:43.122 --> 03:46.547
Relax. It's not mine. It's my mom's.

03:46.589 --> 03:49.408
When I told them I didn't want
them to fly in for this...

03:49.450 --> 03:51.336
they've just been through
too much with Chad...

03:51.378 --> 03:52.982
my mom sent me her rosary.

03:53.024 --> 03:56.888
She swears it got my dad through
his double bypass, and I...

03:56.930 --> 03:59.178
Ugh, I forgot it at home.

03:59.220 --> 04:00.882
Okay. I'll go get it.

04:00.924 --> 04:02.556
- No.
- You sure?

04:02.598 --> 04:05.092
Yeah, it's just beads, right?

04:05.508 --> 04:09.474
But if you ever meet her
and she ever asks you,

04:09.516 --> 04:12.224
I was holding it this entire time.

04:12.885 --> 04:15.518
- Deal.
- Deal.

04:18.976 --> 04:20.639
You know, if you want to do an errand,

04:20.680 --> 04:21.892
you could go get me some more ice chips.

04:21.935 --> 04:23.936
Mm-hmm. I was born to
do stuff like that.

04:23.978 --> 04:25.622
- Yeah.
- You want salsa with your ice chips?

04:25.664 --> 04:28.519
I apologize for that joke.

04:33.089 --> 04:34.584
Boo.

04:34.626 --> 04:37.579
Ooh, what have I found in the printer.

04:37.621 --> 04:39.196
Look at this.

04:39.238 --> 04:41.170
My man's opus, hot off the press.

04:41.212 --> 04:42.904
No, no, no, no. No, baby,
baby, it's not ready.

04:42.946 --> 04:45.127
- I still got to proof it.
- Oh, come on. Just the first scene.

04:45.169 --> 04:46.392
- No.
- I'll look past the typos.

04:46.434 --> 04:48.966
Wouldn't you rather be
reading about that hip new

04:49.008 --> 04:51.388
- "culinary jewel" in Inman Square?
- Oh, my God.

04:51.430 --> 04:53.422
- Is it the restaurant review?
- Mm-hmm.

04:53.464 --> 04:55.103
It's here? "Culinary
jewel"? It said that?

04:55.145 --> 04:57.852
- Yep, and it also says how, like...
- Wait, did you buy all the copies?

04:57.894 --> 04:59.388
Well, I figured we could
pass 'em out to people

04:59.430 --> 05:01.681
- entering nearby restaurants.
- Smart.

05:01.723 --> 05:04.065
"With its mouth-watering food
and up-and-coming location,

05:04.107 --> 05:06.726
I, for one, am glad
'Someday' finally came."

05:06.768 --> 05:08.886
Ooh! Someday is today, baby!

05:08.928 --> 05:11.127
"Its warm ambiance and stylish design

05:11.169 --> 05:14.009
are outdone only by the bold,
ingredient-driven menu."

05:14.051 --> 05:15.023
Yes, they are.

05:15.065 --> 05:16.682
"You may have had
grilled octopus before,

05:16.724 --> 05:18.920
- but never like this."
- I can attest to that.

05:18.962 --> 05:21.363
- Whoa.
- What is it?

05:21.405 --> 05:23.881
"The talent behind this
delectable confection of flavors

05:23.923 --> 05:27.090
is mastermind Andrew Pollock, who
seems to have done it again.

05:27.132 --> 05:29.782
His elegant style is never
more apparent than in..."

05:30.821 --> 05:32.592
"...in the saffron risotto."

05:32.634 --> 05:34.226
O-Okay, wait a minute. That's your dish.

05:34.268 --> 05:36.034
My signature dish.

05:36.076 --> 05:38.112
I got to be in here somewhere.

05:38.154 --> 05:39.342
"Pollock's team in the kitchen

05:39.384 --> 05:41.683
is led by executive chef Regina Howard."

05:41.725 --> 05:43.803
Okay! There's my baby.
What else does it say?

05:43.845 --> 05:45.186
That's it.

05:45.228 --> 05:48.185
Just one line at the
end. I'm a footnote.

05:48.227 --> 05:52.331
Okay. Admittedly, very frustrating.

05:52.373 --> 05:54.392
But, baby, you wanted to give
back your uncle's money.

05:54.434 --> 05:56.694
And Andrew made that possible.

05:56.736 --> 05:59.771
Babe, you can't take on a
huge investor like that

05:59.813 --> 06:03.105
and not expect there to be, you
know, a few strings attached.

06:04.480 --> 06:05.987
Regina.

06:06.571 --> 06:09.231
This is an amazing review.

06:09.273 --> 06:11.553
You basically got six out of five stars.

06:11.595 --> 06:14.828
Yeah. You're right. You're right.

06:15.134 --> 06:17.841
My last place never got press like this.

06:17.883 --> 06:20.665
And this one puts you on the map.

06:21.086 --> 06:24.638
We are definitely framing
several of these.

06:26.583 --> 06:29.896
Welcome, my little flounders of
E. Melvin Elementary School,

06:29.938 --> 06:33.713
to the aquarium and what
promises to be a fin-tastic day.

06:33.755 --> 06:34.988
Okay, uh...

06:35.030 --> 06:37.051
let's just put our lunches
in the cubbies over here.

06:37.093 --> 06:39.522
- Okay? There we go.
- All right, guys, let's go.

06:39.564 --> 06:41.439
- Yes, there will be fun, okay?
- Mom?

06:41.481 --> 06:44.220
- Yeah?
- I left my lunch at school.

06:44.262 --> 06:46.442
Oh, uh, okay. We can
just share my lunch.

06:46.484 --> 06:48.054
It's turkey.

06:48.096 --> 06:50.451
- Oh, no.
- Why, honey? You like turkey.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.403
No. I got another nosebleed.

06:52.445 --> 06:54.176
Okay. Yeah, just keep pinching it.

06:54.218 --> 06:56.476
All right, hurry up, everybody! You
know what they call slow fish.

06:56.518 --> 06:58.206
Shark bait!

06:58.248 --> 07:00.488
- They're leaving!
- It's okay. We'll... We'll catch up.

07:00.530 --> 07:02.949
Put your bag in the cubby,
and let's just get some ice

07:02.991 --> 07:03.937
for the back of your neck, okay?

07:03.979 --> 07:06.103
But I'm gonna miss the
4-D penguin movie.

07:06.145 --> 07:08.979
- The fourth "D" is water.
- Oh, okay.

07:13.097 --> 07:15.198
Our first official rave review!

07:15.240 --> 07:17.467
They called "each dish more
enchanting than the next."

07:17.509 --> 07:18.645
Which they are.

07:18.687 --> 07:21.873
They called your decor "elegant
and stylish." Which it is.

07:21.915 --> 07:24.173
Are you okay, though? I mean,
I know the critic loved us,

07:24.215 --> 07:27.206
but they didn't exactly give you
the credit that you deserve.

07:27.248 --> 07:29.186
Yeah, of course I'm okay.

07:29.769 --> 07:32.237
- Oh, what's with the tables?
- Oh, we ordered four more.

07:32.279 --> 07:34.260
Oh. But when I suggested it last week,

07:34.302 --> 07:36.126
you said you didn't think
we needed extra seating.

07:36.168 --> 07:37.918
I know, but now with this great review,

07:37.960 --> 07:40.270
Andrew thinks we are gonna
get a lot busier, so...

07:40.312 --> 07:42.342
Hey, Delilah. Where do you want these?

07:42.384 --> 07:43.849
Uh, You know what?

07:43.891 --> 07:44.953
Just put them all over there.

07:44.995 --> 07:47.681
Hmm. "Mastermind Andrew
Pollock does it again."

07:54.419 --> 07:56.191
- Gary?
- No, no, no, no. No.

07:56.233 --> 07:57.196
- Gary?
- All right, ma'am,

07:57.238 --> 07:58.091
just take some deep breaths.

07:58.133 --> 07:59.685
No, no, no, no! Here I
am! I'm right here!

07:59.727 --> 08:02.336
- Look. I-I brought you these.
- I tried to make them wait.

08:02.378 --> 08:04.118
It's okay. It's okay.

08:05.197 --> 08:07.008
Why didn't you tell me about Linda?

08:07.050 --> 08:08.777
Oh, hold on. Please, please.

08:09.326 --> 08:11.680
- One second.
- How... How did you know about that?

08:11.722 --> 08:13.407
I didn't want to say anything,

08:13.449 --> 08:16.717
but I texted her this morning,
and her daughter called me.

08:16.759 --> 08:17.689
Okay.

08:17.731 --> 08:20.282
She was so sure that she
was gonna beat this.

08:20.324 --> 08:23.598
Okay. Okay. You listen to me, Bloom.

08:24.493 --> 08:26.877
What happened to Linda is
not gonna happen to you.

08:26.919 --> 08:29.617
You hear me?

08:29.659 --> 08:31.393
I'm gonna see you later.

08:33.405 --> 08:35.304
Okay. Okay.

08:54.069 --> 08:56.674
Dude, unless you are
powering this hospital

08:56.716 --> 08:58.003
with your foot...

08:58.346 --> 08:59.179
Sorry.

08:59.221 --> 09:00.844
You need a distraction.

09:03.394 --> 09:05.763
How 'bout this? How 'bout you
let me read your script?

09:07.929 --> 09:10.350
"Untitled." That's ...That's mysterious.

09:10.392 --> 09:12.401
I'll let you read it as
soon as you wash your hat.

09:12.443 --> 09:14.378
I know you think that thing
got you through cancer,

09:14.420 --> 09:16.813
but when's the last time
you actually washed it?

09:16.855 --> 09:19.063
If I wash the hat, I might
wash out the good luck.

09:20.088 --> 09:22.848
It doesn't matter if it makes
sense to you. See, it only

09:22.890 --> 09:25.114
needs to make sense to me.

09:30.036 --> 09:31.720
You can hold down the fort, right?

09:31.762 --> 09:33.199
There's something I got to do.

09:33.241 --> 09:35.320
- Now who's being mysterious?
- I'll be right back.

09:35.362 --> 09:37.581
I just got to get something.
Text me any updates.

09:37.623 --> 09:38.615
- Where are you going?
- I'll be right back.

09:38.657 --> 09:41.235
- What are you gonna get?
- Just text me updates.

09:45.873 --> 09:48.319
_

09:56.862 --> 09:58.463
How great was that review?

09:58.505 --> 10:00.630
Yeah, it was pretty great.

10:00.672 --> 10:02.987
I think you're one step
closer to a Michelin star.

10:04.174 --> 10:05.439
All right, Table 12.

10:05.481 --> 10:07.696
- One octopus, one steak, one salmon.
- Now, wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

10:07.738 --> 10:09.777
Maybe put a little
balsamic drizzle on that,

10:09.819 --> 10:12.320
just a little pop of color for balance?

10:14.960 --> 10:16.532
It's perfect, Luis. Table 12's waiting.

10:16.574 --> 10:17.703
- Please.
- Yes, Chef.

10:17.745 --> 10:18.823
Sorry.

10:18.865 --> 10:20.613
Church and state. Kitchen's your domain.

10:20.655 --> 10:21.783
Oh, uh, which reminds me...

10:21.825 --> 10:22.783
"Fenway Foodies" is gonna come by.

10:22.825 --> 10:23.744
They want to do a profile.

10:23.786 --> 10:25.000
They'll interview you later today.

10:25.042 --> 10:26.097
They do?

10:26.139 --> 10:27.968
Yeah, of course. You're the chef.

10:37.008 --> 10:38.966
I am never gonna find a spot.

10:39.008 --> 10:40.551
Uh, talk about miracles.

10:40.593 --> 10:41.711
Thank you, Virgin Mary.

10:41.753 --> 10:43.197
Now remember where we parked.

10:43.239 --> 10:44.361
2B.

10:46.112 --> 10:48.320
2B or not 2B.

10:48.362 --> 10:49.910
Come on, Gramps.

10:49.952 --> 10:51.200
Don't make me wait your whole life.

10:51.242 --> 10:53.780
What the hell? Oh, no. No, she's not.

10:53.822 --> 10:55.950
No, no, no, no, no. No, no,
no. This is not happening!

10:55.992 --> 10:57.857
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:57.899 --> 11:00.257
Ah, ah, ah, ah! Ah, ah, ah! Excuse me.

11:00.299 --> 11:01.321
Excuse me!

11:01.363 --> 11:03.953
Absolutely not! You saw
me. I was here first.

11:03.995 --> 11:06.290
I know you... I know you
saw me. I was waiting.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.792
I-I was here first.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.462
No, you... you weren't here first.

11:09.504 --> 11:11.529
If you were here first, then you
would be in this parking spot.

11:11.571 --> 11:14.715
Oh, please don't... don't be
that... don't be that person.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.020
Not today.

11:16.062 --> 11:17.280
Are you okay?

11:17.322 --> 11:18.454
No, I'm not ...not today.

11:18.496 --> 11:20.028
'Cause you seem like maybe
you need the psych ward,

11:20.070 --> 11:21.999
and if you do, that's just three blocks

11:22.041 --> 11:23.975
- down that way, okay?
- A psych ward?!

11:24.017 --> 11:25.265
- Get out of my spot.
- This isn't your spot.

11:25.307 --> 11:26.475
I'm sorry. Get out of my spot.

11:26.517 --> 11:27.758
- It's my spot.
- Please get out of my spot?

11:28.873 --> 11:29.864
How about that?

11:32.834 --> 11:34.450
- I could do this all day.
- Yeah, whatever.

11:34.492 --> 11:36.073
I could do this all day!

11:36.115 --> 11:37.860
Unbelievable!

11:37.902 --> 11:40.486
Oh, hey. If the box is empty, I need it.

11:40.528 --> 11:41.576
Don't break it apart.

11:41.618 --> 11:42.736
You know, if you can't afford a crib,

11:42.778 --> 11:44.366
I can always build you one.

11:45.948 --> 11:47.139
No, I, um...

11:47.181 --> 11:50.084
I actually have to pack
Jon's things up tonight.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.738
Oh, wow.

11:52.198 --> 11:55.047
- Yep.
- You know, when Debra died,

11:55.089 --> 11:56.240
I couldn't face it.

11:56.282 --> 11:59.427
So I ended up giving all her stuff away.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.764
Now, most days, I-I just...
I wish I had it back.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.183
I get that.

12:06.069 --> 12:07.702
This is...

12:08.169 --> 12:09.345
This is different, though.

12:09.387 --> 12:11.084
Jon had, uh...

12:11.126 --> 12:13.602
had an apartment that
I didn't know about.

12:14.772 --> 12:15.849
Wow.

12:16.772 --> 12:18.810
I don't know if I'm ready
to deal with a past

12:18.852 --> 12:20.757
- that I never knew about, you know?
- Yeah.

12:20.799 --> 12:23.060
Well, when you are,

12:23.102 --> 12:24.270
I want you to know

12:24.312 --> 12:26.711
that you don't have to do it alone.

12:26.753 --> 12:28.072
Deal?

12:30.363 --> 12:31.441
Deal.

12:36.329 --> 12:37.456
Dude, and then this lady comes...

12:37.498 --> 12:39.345
and by "lady," I'm
being very generous...

12:39.387 --> 12:41.473
down the wrong way, zips
in, steals my spot,

12:41.515 --> 12:42.880
pretends like she doesn't see me

12:42.922 --> 12:45.177
sitting there with my
indicator indicating.

12:45.219 --> 12:46.880
- What is he upset about?
- Everything.

12:46.922 --> 12:48.124
But, uh, right now,

12:48.166 --> 12:49.574
someone stealing his parking space.

12:49.616 --> 12:51.402
- Who wants coffee?
- We have a humanity problem.

12:51.444 --> 12:52.609
Getting you decaf. Rome?

12:52.651 --> 12:53.705
No, I'm good.

12:53.747 --> 12:54.914
Uh, Patricia's getting me one.

12:54.956 --> 12:56.664
Patricia? Who's Patricia?

12:56.706 --> 12:58.090
Rome, here's your coffee.

12:58.132 --> 12:59.610
Oh, thank you.

12:59.652 --> 13:02.110
Gary, this is Maggie's mom.

13:04.782 --> 13:08.110
Y-Yeah, we have, uh...
We have already met.

13:12.365 --> 13:14.693
Dude, what exactly happened
in that parking lot, man?

13:14.735 --> 13:17.879
Well, let's put it this
way... I lost it, okay?

13:17.921 --> 13:20.443
- And things were said.
- What things exactly?

13:20.485 --> 13:22.734
Eh, the word "liar" may have been used.

13:22.776 --> 13:24.701
"Liar"? That's... That's...
That's pretty harsh.

13:24.743 --> 13:26.194
But still, not a total loss.

13:26.236 --> 13:28.076
No, y-you can bounce back
from "liar." What else?

13:28.118 --> 13:31.394
- "Shriveled."
- "Shriveled" is not good.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.104
A lot of people don't bounce
back from "shriveled."

13:33.146 --> 13:35.274
Okay, "shriveled" is problematic.

13:35.316 --> 13:36.440
- Come on.
- Is that it?

13:36.482 --> 13:37.560
No.

13:37.602 --> 13:38.850
I called her Dick Cheney.

13:38.892 --> 13:40.020
What's so bad about...

13:40.062 --> 13:41.440
- I left off the "Cheney."
- Oh, no.

13:41.482 --> 13:42.818
- Oh, no, you didn't do that.
- That's not good.

13:42.860 --> 13:46.254
I didn't know it was
Maggie's mother, obviously.

13:46.296 --> 13:47.614
But come on, man.

13:47.656 --> 13:49.021
She stole my freaking parking spot!

13:49.063 --> 13:51.566
You just go over there and be the
most caring, concerned version

13:51.608 --> 13:52.794
of Maggie's boyfriend you can be.

13:52.836 --> 13:54.101
And whatever you do,

13:54.143 --> 13:56.836
do not mention the parking spot.

13:57.695 --> 13:59.025
Go.

14:02.954 --> 14:04.372
I'm proud of you.

14:10.566 --> 14:12.524
Here we go.

14:12.566 --> 14:14.606
10 bucks says he brings
up the parking spot.

14:19.901 --> 14:22.191
The nurse says Maggie
should be out by 3:00.

14:24.781 --> 14:26.991
By the way, your daughter is amazing.

14:28.039 --> 14:29.435
Thank you.

14:29.477 --> 14:33.289
Yeah, it's been so great
getting to know her, and...

14:34.567 --> 14:37.315
I'd like to get to know you, too.

14:37.357 --> 14:40.575
You don't have to do this.
I live seven hours away.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.468
Anyway, I just want you to know

14:48.510 --> 14:51.086
how much I love your daughter, truly.

14:52.052 --> 14:53.932
I am here for her day and night.

14:55.914 --> 14:56.952
I mean, not all night.

14:56.994 --> 14:58.572
Not... Not through the...

14:58.614 --> 15:01.374
I mean, I stay over some...

15:01.416 --> 15:04.201
Trust me, my toothbrush does not reside

15:04.243 --> 15:05.574
in your daughter's bathroom.

15:06.430 --> 15:08.020
Well, that's good to know.

15:12.553 --> 15:14.303
Okay.

15:16.413 --> 15:17.873
Look, Patricia,

15:17.915 --> 15:19.204
let's just call it like it is, okay?

15:19.246 --> 15:20.206
You're angry,

15:20.248 --> 15:22.456
and you have every reason to be.

15:22.498 --> 15:24.337
I was a jerk in that parking lot,

15:24.379 --> 15:27.073
I overreacted, and I apologize.

15:27.115 --> 15:29.272
- Wow. That's good.
- Okay.

15:29.314 --> 15:30.935
Okay.

15:32.270 --> 15:34.358
I... appreciate that.

15:34.400 --> 15:38.399
Great. And I'm willing to
move forward if you are.

15:39.267 --> 15:40.920
Well, I certainly will try.

15:41.973 --> 15:43.048
What?

15:43.440 --> 15:44.575
What?

15:46.350 --> 15:47.858
It's just...

15:47.900 --> 15:49.947
I have very... I have
very strong principles.

15:49.989 --> 15:51.067
- Oh, God, he's doing it.
- Oh, no.

15:51.109 --> 15:52.277
W-What does that mean?

15:52.319 --> 15:53.867
Well, it means that I
came over here and...

15:53.909 --> 15:56.777
and I admitted that I was wrong,

15:56.819 --> 15:59.031
and now, perhaps, you would
like to do the same.

15:59.073 --> 16:00.161
What?

16:01.413 --> 16:02.621
I didn't do anything wrong.

16:02.663 --> 16:03.835
Are you kidding me?

16:03.877 --> 16:06.045
- Patricia, I know you saw me waiting.
- Gary, Stop! Stop.

16:06.087 --> 16:07.715
I know you saw my indicator indicating.

16:07.757 --> 16:09.455
And I know that you know

16:09.497 --> 16:10.915
that you went down the wrong way

16:10.957 --> 16:12.088
and you stole my spot.

16:12.130 --> 16:13.757
Wow. Wow, wow.

16:16.337 --> 16:17.545
You are quite a catch.

16:17.587 --> 16:18.997
Wh...

16:21.496 --> 16:22.996
Hi.

16:29.929 --> 16:31.818
- It's so cold!
- I know, T,

16:31.860 --> 16:33.509
but you know it helps stop the bleeding.

16:33.551 --> 16:34.740
I want to play with my friends!

16:34.782 --> 16:36.571
I should be wearing that shark hat.

16:36.613 --> 16:39.162
Okay, how about we just sit
here for a few minutes.

16:39.204 --> 16:41.251
We can share my lunch.

16:41.293 --> 16:42.548
It'll be fun.

16:42.590 --> 16:44.804
Nothing about this is fun.

16:45.848 --> 16:47.306
Okay. Here.

17:08.990 --> 17:10.698

17:10.740 --> 17:12.778
is because we're listening to the radio

Yeah. Me, too.

17:45.762 --> 17:47.471
Hey, D.

17:47.513 --> 17:49.562
No. No real updates.

17:49.604 --> 17:51.473
She'll be out in an hour or so.

17:51.515 --> 17:53.864
Yeah. She's not out of surgery yet.

17:54.279 --> 17:55.497
Oh, I know, I know,

17:55.539 --> 17:56.908
but I'm here for both of us, Eugene,

17:56.950 --> 17:58.699
so you should just go
back to your conference,

17:58.741 --> 18:00.573
and I'll call you later, okay?

18:00.615 --> 18:02.904
I have a <i> lot </i> to update you on.

18:02.946 --> 18:06.096
I have a lot to update you on.

18:08.162 --> 18:10.250
You didn't happen to see a
script laying around here?

18:10.292 --> 18:12.501
Um, I'm sorry. I-I haven't seen it.

18:12.543 --> 18:14.616
Uh, but Maggie told me
that you're a writer.

18:14.658 --> 18:16.697
- Yes.
- That is so creative.

18:16.739 --> 18:20.118
Yeah, well, I wouldn't
call myself creati...

18:20.160 --> 18:21.239
Could you excuse me?

18:21.281 --> 18:23.240
Oh, sure. Well, I'll keep my eye out.

18:23.282 --> 18:24.283
Thank you.

18:25.766 --> 18:27.217
- What?
- You two pals now?

18:27.259 --> 18:28.350
Come on, man. Really?

18:28.392 --> 18:29.592
I'm looking for my damn script.

18:29.634 --> 18:31.660
Yeah, she probably stole it,
like she stole my spot.

18:31.702 --> 18:33.579
Hey, maybe you left it over
at the vending machine.

18:33.621 --> 18:35.225
I was just gonna take a
Little Debbie break.

18:35.267 --> 18:36.112
I could do that.

18:36.154 --> 18:38.575
Hey, hey! You guys don't
have to go together.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.653
You leave me all by myself with her,

18:40.695 --> 18:42.079
that's just gonna make things worse.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.914
Dude, relax, okay?

18:43.956 --> 18:45.833
It can't get any worse.

18:51.822 --> 18:53.571
<i>MTP to O.R. 3.</i>

18:53.613 --> 18:55.018
<i>Blood bank on stand-by.</i>

18:55.060 --> 18:57.221
<i>MTP to O.R. 3.</i>

18:59.098 --> 19:00.255
Excuse me.

19:00.572 --> 19:02.941
- Is Maggie Bloom in O.R. 3?
- I'm sorry, sir.

19:02.983 --> 19:05.343
They don't give us that
information, but...

19:08.609 --> 19:10.067
Excuse me. What was that announcement?

19:10.109 --> 19:11.568
W-What's an MTP?

19:11.610 --> 19:13.178
I'm not allowed to give
out that information.

19:13.220 --> 19:15.549
What does MTP stand for, please?

19:15.591 --> 19:17.312
Massive Transfusion Protocol.

19:17.354 --> 19:19.867
Okay. I-Is Maggie Bloom in O.R. 3?

19:19.909 --> 19:21.158
I apologize, sir,

19:21.200 --> 19:23.055
but if there's anything you
need to know, your doctor...

19:23.097 --> 19:24.855
- 20 units of A-negative?
- Yeah.

19:28.521 --> 19:30.530
That's Maggie's blood type.

19:44.360 --> 19:45.520
Robin.

19:46.455 --> 19:47.673
Is Maggie okay?

19:47.715 --> 19:49.514
We heard there was a...
an emergency transfusion.

19:49.556 --> 19:51.055
That was for another patient.

19:51.097 --> 19:52.356
Oh...

19:52.398 --> 19:54.149
Oh, so... so she's okay?

19:55.160 --> 19:57.078
The surgery's taking
longer than expected

19:57.120 --> 19:58.909
because of the positioning of the tumor.

19:58.951 --> 20:00.992
The doctor will update
you as soon as he can.

20:01.574 --> 20:03.314
Okay. Thank you.

20:05.403 --> 20:08.242
What if they... find more cancer?

20:08.284 --> 20:09.422
I mean, that was what
happened last time.

20:09.464 --> 20:11.343
They found more cancer, and then...

20:11.385 --> 20:13.636
then she had to have the mastectomy.

20:15.684 --> 20:17.934
She's... She's gonna be okay.

20:19.288 --> 20:21.037
You don't know that.

20:30.474 --> 20:32.489
The scan under-called this mass.

20:32.531 --> 20:35.160
- Give me more gauze.
- Yes, doctor.

20:35.202 --> 20:37.491
This appears to be
more advanced disease.

20:37.533 --> 20:38.992
Yeah.

20:39.034 --> 20:41.373
- Keep Path on stand-by.
- Will do.

20:41.415 --> 20:43.204
Are you seeing this?

20:43.246 --> 20:45.042
Let's see if we can get a closer look.

20:45.084 --> 20:47.534
Are those margins clear?

20:49.027 --> 20:50.031
Hey.

20:50.073 --> 20:51.937
Any luck finding that screenplay?

20:51.979 --> 20:53.807
Nah, it probably got tossed out.

20:53.849 --> 20:55.647
Where you going?

20:55.689 --> 20:57.361
Oh. Yeah, I told Gary.

20:57.403 --> 20:59.750
Um, I promised Katherine I'd swing by

20:59.792 --> 21:02.094
and sign the divorce papers.

21:02.136 --> 21:04.844
Ooh. That's got to be rough, man.

21:04.886 --> 21:06.223
It's weird.

21:06.886 --> 21:08.674
Like, she and I are
getting along better now

21:08.716 --> 21:10.134
than we have in a long time.

21:10.176 --> 21:12.062
Well, it sounds like it's for the best.

21:12.926 --> 21:14.106
Yeah.

21:15.055 --> 21:16.843
Well, let me know if
there are any updates.

21:16.885 --> 21:18.015
Will do.

21:20.805 --> 21:22.265
Hey.

21:22.943 --> 21:24.401
I think that's mine.

21:24.443 --> 21:26.232
Oh. Sorry, I-I just, uh...

21:26.274 --> 21:27.652
I found it in the waiting room.

21:27.694 --> 21:28.772
I've been here all day.

21:28.814 --> 21:30.192
You want to swap out for an "Us Weekly,"

21:30.234 --> 21:31.286
because I'm gonna need that back.

21:31.328 --> 21:32.705
Yeah, yeah, sure. My bad.

21:32.747 --> 21:34.664
Thank you, man.

21:35.354 --> 21:36.622
Hey, can I ask you,

21:36.664 --> 21:38.641
does Leo ever tell Nina the truth?

21:38.683 --> 21:39.802
What?

21:39.844 --> 21:41.762
I got to know, man.

21:41.804 --> 21:42.946
Wait.

21:43.474 --> 21:44.512
You liked it?

21:44.554 --> 21:45.900
Yeah, it's great.

21:45.942 --> 21:47.823
So, does he tell her?

21:49.154 --> 21:50.572
You know what?

21:50.614 --> 21:53.443
Make yourself comfortable. Finish it.

21:53.485 --> 21:55.194
I'm-a get you a blueberry scone

21:55.236 --> 21:58.905
or whatever else this
vending machine is hocking.

21:58.947 --> 22:00.786
Two more.

22:07.524 --> 22:09.693
Okay, what's going on? Why
are we angry chopping?

22:09.735 --> 22:10.896
We're not.

22:12.383 --> 22:13.761
Regina, come on.

22:13.803 --> 22:16.132
Talk to me before another
carrot has to die.

22:17.353 --> 22:18.400
It's just, everywhere I turn,

22:18.442 --> 22:19.610
there's Andrew stepping on my toes.

22:19.652 --> 22:20.691
I know.

22:20.733 --> 22:22.404
The guy's been an investor
for all of two weeks,

22:22.446 --> 22:24.212
and he's already weighing
in like an equal partner.

22:24.254 --> 22:25.712
I know, but, Gina, he's the reason

22:25.754 --> 22:27.962
we were able to open in the first place.

22:28.004 --> 22:30.474
And he... And he pulled a favor
and got the critic here.

22:30.516 --> 22:31.703
Yeah, but that review
makes it sound like

22:31.745 --> 22:33.453
the restaurant is his idea.

22:33.495 --> 22:35.333
You know, D, we worked
so hard on this place

22:35.375 --> 22:36.793
and I am barely mentioned,

22:36.835 --> 22:38.033
and you're left out of it entirely.

22:38.075 --> 22:39.693
That... doesn't bother you?

22:39.735 --> 22:42.150
No. No, it doesn't,
because we're so busy,

22:42.192 --> 22:43.610
we're turning people away.

22:43.652 --> 22:46.240
So if that's partly due
to Andrew, then great.

22:46.282 --> 22:48.025
I'm grateful that we have
somebody in our corner

22:48.067 --> 22:49.437
who knows what they're doing.

22:50.247 --> 22:52.375
- I didn't mean that...
- Really?

22:52.417 --> 22:54.005
Because you didn't think
it was a good idea

22:54.047 --> 22:55.625
to bring in more tables
when I wanted to,

22:55.667 --> 22:57.705
but as soon as Andrew
suggested it, then it's fine.

22:57.747 --> 22:59.276
That's not fair.

22:59.318 --> 23:01.547
You know, this was
supposed to be my do-over.

23:02.297 --> 23:04.005
How am I supposed to believe in myself

23:04.047 --> 23:05.791
when my own partner and
best friend doesn't?

23:05.833 --> 23:06.819
Gina, I didn't...

23:06.861 --> 23:08.927
I have to get ready for the dinner rush.

23:16.586 --> 23:17.794
- Really?
- Yes.

23:17.836 --> 23:19.464
All right. Thanks.

23:19.506 --> 23:20.532
Excuse me.

23:20.574 --> 23:22.433
The woman that was sitting right there

23:22.475 --> 23:23.884
has been gone for quite a while.

23:23.926 --> 23:25.030
You have any idea where she went?

23:25.072 --> 23:26.467
- No.
- No, of course not.

23:59.866 --> 24:01.617
I swore not to tell you this,

24:01.659 --> 24:05.538
but... Maggie forgot it.

24:05.580 --> 24:07.837
And I went back to her place to grab it,

24:07.879 --> 24:09.167
and that's where I was coming from

24:09.209 --> 24:10.491
when we...

24:12.129 --> 24:13.379
when we met.

24:15.629 --> 24:17.337
I thought you might want it.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.709
Thank you.

24:32.685 --> 24:33.755
Gary.

24:40.226 --> 24:41.644
Sit with me.

24:45.396 --> 24:47.024
Okay, we made it.

24:52.602 --> 24:54.184
How about I make you a snack?

24:54.226 --> 24:56.087
I don't want one.

24:56.720 --> 24:58.909
Just so you know, you
did a bad job today.

25:01.306 --> 25:04.212
Actually, I did a great job today.

25:04.936 --> 25:06.935
I studied up on manatees,

25:07.371 --> 25:10.438
and I helped Maya find her inhaler,

25:11.266 --> 25:13.575
and I spent some quality
time with my son.

25:13.617 --> 25:15.644
But you didn't cheer me up.

25:15.686 --> 25:16.757
Well, I tried.

25:16.799 --> 25:18.350
But you didn't!

25:19.622 --> 25:21.513
I knew it should've been Dad.

25:25.524 --> 25:26.633
You know what, T?

25:27.189 --> 25:28.405
That's not okay.

25:28.814 --> 25:30.896
I took the day off to spend with you.

25:30.938 --> 25:32.359
I helped you stop your nosebleed,

25:32.401 --> 25:34.286
I gave you the big half of my sandwich,

25:34.328 --> 25:35.832
and I'm sorry you're in a bad mood,

25:35.874 --> 25:37.828
but that doesn't mean you
get to take it out on me.

25:42.286 --> 25:43.898
I'm sorry, Mom.

25:48.325 --> 25:50.286
Give me a consequence.

25:51.459 --> 25:53.677
Should I take out the recycling?

25:58.729 --> 26:00.724
Do you feel bad about what you said?

26:03.639 --> 26:05.558
That's your consequence.

26:19.408 --> 26:21.578
You're not religious, are you?

26:24.868 --> 26:27.196
Um, my father is Mexican.

26:27.238 --> 26:28.837
I was raised Catholic.

26:29.526 --> 26:32.616
Church every Sunday, twice at Christmas.

26:34.530 --> 26:36.488
When my mom left, it
was just me and Pops.

26:36.530 --> 26:38.528
He wanted to go more,
I wanted to go less,

26:38.570 --> 26:40.988
and by the time I left home, I was...

26:41.030 --> 26:43.858
- You were over it.
- I was way over it.

26:47.566 --> 26:49.854
Well, I bought this from
a woman in Calcutta

26:49.896 --> 26:54.826
who swore that it was
blessed by Mother Teresa.

26:58.456 --> 27:00.919
I don't know if it was
or it wasn't, but...

27:01.663 --> 27:05.281
in my family, whenever anyone
was sick or in crisis,

27:05.323 --> 27:08.743
we would pass it around.

27:11.539 --> 27:13.539
I don't know if it helped.

27:17.249 --> 27:19.419
Yeah, but you don't know that it didn't.

27:20.539 --> 27:22.827
There was time that I was
a lapsed Catholic there

27:22.869 --> 27:24.457
for a while myself.

27:29.942 --> 27:32.094
Maggie told me about Chad.

27:32.136 --> 27:33.677
I'm sorry.

27:35.755 --> 27:36.883
Thank you.

27:42.801 --> 27:44.460
Yeah, it wasn't till Maggie got sick

27:44.502 --> 27:46.921
that I found my way back to God.

27:46.963 --> 27:48.462
Guess it's true what they say...

27:48.504 --> 27:51.461
there are no atheists in a foxhole.

27:52.143 --> 27:53.523
Hmm.

27:57.902 --> 28:00.562
I can't lose another child.

28:28.450 --> 28:29.658
In the third act...

28:29.700 --> 28:32.868
Oh, and... and the part
with the anti-depressants,

28:32.910 --> 28:34.868
you know, when, uh, when...
when Leo told his dad,

28:34.910 --> 28:36.568
- "That... That's me trying to fix me."
- "Trying to fix me."

28:37.910 --> 28:39.608
But his dad, he didn't want to hear it.

28:39.650 --> 28:41.270
He didn't want to go there.

28:41.312 --> 28:42.767
That felt so real.

28:44.808 --> 28:46.558
Is this based on your life?

28:48.084 --> 28:49.584
Kind of, yeah.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.830
That really spoke to me, man.

28:54.190 --> 28:55.749
I've had days like that.

28:56.928 --> 28:58.645
Like Leo, when...

28:59.614 --> 29:00.798
When I...

29:01.907 --> 29:04.034
When I couldn't breathe.

29:05.367 --> 29:07.785
And... And... And sometimes,
it's just, like,

29:07.827 --> 29:11.830
what I'm going through is
invisible to everybody but me.

29:11.872 --> 29:15.003
But... But reading this,

29:16.111 --> 29:18.838
it made me realize that maybe
other people feel invisible, too.

29:22.101 --> 29:23.142
They do.

29:24.262 --> 29:25.747
But they're not.

29:27.128 --> 29:28.321
And neither are you.

29:28.974 --> 29:30.100
I see you.

29:31.946 --> 29:33.547
I'm PJ.

29:34.482 --> 29:36.083
Nice to meet you, PJ.

29:36.125 --> 29:37.608
Rome.

29:37.650 --> 29:38.981
Hey.

29:39.023 --> 29:40.935
Table 9 wants to talk to you.

29:40.977 --> 29:42.446
Okay. Can you send Andrew out there?

29:42.488 --> 29:43.826
He loves to hobnob with the guests.

29:43.868 --> 29:46.519
I would, but they
specifically asked for you.

29:53.423 --> 29:54.802
Hi. Welcome to Someday.

29:54.844 --> 29:56.404
Is there something I can help you with?

29:56.446 --> 29:58.694
Uh, actually, yes. It's
about the risotto.

29:58.736 --> 30:00.830
- Is there a problem?
- Well, not anymore,

30:00.872 --> 30:03.736
but we had to wait two
years to have it again.

30:04.706 --> 30:07.374
We used to go to your
old place all the time.

30:07.416 --> 30:08.707
And then it closed.

30:09.239 --> 30:10.987
And then this one tried
to make it at home,

30:11.029 --> 30:12.408
and it was a disaster.

30:12.450 --> 30:13.468
Well, thank you,

30:13.510 --> 30:15.480
and I'm sorry for keeping you waiting.

30:15.522 --> 30:17.449
- What are you drinking?
- Pinot Gris.

30:17.491 --> 30:19.386
Okay. Two more glasses coming up.

30:19.428 --> 30:20.569
Thanks.

30:22.729 --> 30:24.907
- Two glasses of Pinot Gris, please.
- Yeah.

30:26.790 --> 30:28.034
Well played.

30:28.076 --> 30:29.452
How could you think for one second

30:29.494 --> 30:30.721
that I don't believe in you?

30:30.763 --> 30:32.288
I'm your biggest fan.

30:32.330 --> 30:35.166
I guess my insecurities
just got the best of me.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.627
If you're saying that
your past can haunt you,

30:37.669 --> 30:39.587
I am familiar with that concept.

30:40.828 --> 30:43.166
- Ready to go?
- Is it okay if I skip out?

30:43.208 --> 30:44.886
Andrew's gonna help me move the boxes

30:44.928 --> 30:46.916
- out of Jon's apartment.
- Oh. Of course. Of course.

30:46.958 --> 30:48.939
Um, thank you.

30:48.981 --> 30:50.076
That's really nice of you.

30:50.118 --> 30:52.193
Well, we help each other out, right?

30:53.181 --> 30:54.730
- Good night.
- Good night.

31:22.799 --> 31:25.220
<i>National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.</i>

31:26.393 --> 31:28.431
<i>Hello? Are you there?</i>

31:28.473 --> 31:30.963
Yeah, uh... I'm not calling for help.

31:31.005 --> 31:34.021
Um, I'm calling to see
how I can volunteer.

31:41.392 --> 31:43.012
Hi, honey.

31:46.452 --> 31:50.104
So... I met your mom.

31:53.505 --> 31:55.580
I stole his parking spot.

32:01.361 --> 32:03.112
Okay.

32:06.738 --> 32:09.818
I'm sorry again about how
I behaved today, Mommy.

32:14.021 --> 32:16.867
I want you to...

32:16.909 --> 32:19.938
remember something really important.

32:21.231 --> 32:24.651
You know earlier today
when you were mean to me

32:24.693 --> 32:26.987
or when I was upset with you?

32:27.387 --> 32:29.389
You know what's true
about both those times?

32:30.221 --> 32:32.534
I never stopped loving you.

32:33.714 --> 32:36.002
You know, sometimes, you and I

32:36.044 --> 32:38.582
are gonna be upset with each other.

32:39.485 --> 32:41.735
But that doesn't mean I don't love you.

32:42.765 --> 32:44.725
Just like you and Dad.

32:49.645 --> 32:51.244
Yeah.

32:57.343 --> 32:58.585
Hey.

32:59.616 --> 33:02.606
Just came by so we
could sign the papers.

33:04.856 --> 33:06.794
What are you smiling about?

33:06.836 --> 33:08.843
Our son just learned remorse.

33:09.543 --> 33:11.614
Ah, well, I guess...

33:11.656 --> 33:14.326
Theo and I both learned
that one this year.

33:15.446 --> 33:16.870
Maybe we all did.

33:17.976 --> 33:19.562
When I called you today...

33:19.604 --> 33:21.979
...I saw you light up.

33:22.558 --> 33:26.132
And I realized it's been a long time

33:26.174 --> 33:30.550
since I made you feel
good about yourself.

33:31.102 --> 33:33.328
Maybe that's why you and Delilah...

33:34.039 --> 33:36.164
Maybe that's part of why it happened.

33:37.374 --> 33:38.808
I guess after that,

33:38.850 --> 33:41.578
I wasn't feeling so good about myself,

33:41.620 --> 33:43.380
so Hunter and I...

33:44.431 --> 33:45.578
I know you saw the plates.

33:45.620 --> 33:46.925
You don't need to explain.

33:46.967 --> 33:48.068
I know.

33:49.836 --> 33:51.506
I want to.

33:53.090 --> 33:55.090
I needed to feel noticed.

33:58.630 --> 34:00.522
I guess we both did.

34:07.353 --> 34:08.681
Katherine?

34:19.933 --> 34:23.563
You are amazing.

34:26.080 --> 34:27.789
In every single way.

34:28.507 --> 34:30.321
And I am sorry

34:30.993 --> 34:32.753
that I didn't tell you more.

34:37.802 --> 34:39.327
Hey.

34:52.560 --> 34:54.525
I don't want to be shark bait!

34:54.567 --> 34:57.297
I'm the slowest one! It's gonna eat me!

34:58.045 --> 34:59.631
- It's a night terror.
- Night terror.

34:59.673 --> 35:01.144
- It has sharp teeth!
- It's okay, bud.

35:01.186 --> 35:03.187
- Get it away from me!
- You're having a bad dream.

35:18.767 --> 35:22.262
Hey.

35:22.934 --> 35:25.019
Hey, we fell asleep.

35:25.061 --> 35:27.270
Oh, God.

35:28.385 --> 35:30.396
We better get out of
here before he wakes up.

35:45.305 --> 35:46.570
This is for you.

35:46.612 --> 35:49.763
Really?

35:51.532 --> 35:52.496
Mm.

35:52.538 --> 35:53.973
"Invisible."

35:54.015 --> 35:56.183
I like it.

36:09.282 --> 36:11.394
- Um, babe?
- Oh. Yeah.

36:11.436 --> 36:13.046
Yeah, I'll give you space.

36:13.088 --> 36:14.520
You can get me some coffee.

36:14.562 --> 36:16.233
That, too. Okay.

36:18.462 --> 36:19.680
I'm sorry. I just...

36:19.722 --> 36:21.792
I didn't want to confuse Theo.

36:21.834 --> 36:23.667
No, no. I totally get it.

36:38.135 --> 36:40.427
This table has been a part...

36:40.469 --> 36:43.184
...of every big moment in our lives.

36:46.999 --> 36:48.287
I will say I enjoyed

36:48.329 --> 36:49.577
the other things we did on this table

36:49.619 --> 36:50.787
more than this.

37:22.472 --> 37:24.078
Nine years,

37:24.665 --> 37:26.619
boiled down to one signature.

37:28.167 --> 37:29.409
It feels like it

37:29.451 --> 37:31.076
should've been a bigger deal.

37:33.622 --> 37:36.254
Yeah.

37:39.692 --> 37:41.839
I'll file it as soon as
I get to the office.

37:41.881 --> 37:42.919
Okay.

37:42.961 --> 37:45.589
Thanks.

37:48.641 --> 37:50.519
Okay.

37:50.561 --> 37:53.681
Okay.

38:02.335 --> 38:03.924
Oh, hey.

38:03.966 --> 38:05.241
You up?

38:06.110 --> 38:07.452
Yeah.

38:08.384 --> 38:10.271
You get discharged at noon.

38:12.525 --> 38:13.983
So, what do you want to do today?

38:15.451 --> 38:17.648
I don't know. What do
you want to do today?

38:18.212 --> 38:19.464
I...

38:20.321 --> 38:21.949
want to rent a truck...

38:25.112 --> 38:26.925
...and have you move in with me.

38:27.872 --> 38:29.450
- You're serious?
- Yeah.

38:31.017 --> 38:33.177
I don't want to go home to <i> my</i> place.

38:34.508 --> 38:36.508
I want to go home to <i> our</i> place.

38:37.823 --> 38:40.281
Gary, we're still holding our breath

38:40.323 --> 38:42.162
waiting for the pathology report,

38:42.204 --> 38:44.874
- 'cause we don't know...
- We don't know what?

38:44.916 --> 38:46.148
That I love you?

38:47.107 --> 38:48.257
We know.

38:49.745 --> 38:51.823
However many moments we have left,

38:51.865 --> 38:54.082
I want to spend them with you.

38:55.908 --> 38:57.406
I don't want to not live

38:57.448 --> 38:59.408
because I'm afraid of not living.

39:02.064 --> 39:04.862
Besides, you're already packed.

39:05.906 --> 39:07.616
This just makes sense.

39:09.397 --> 39:12.395
Mm...

39:12.437 --> 39:13.818
What's the matter?

39:14.631 --> 39:16.419
Are you gonna throw up?

39:16.461 --> 39:17.920
God, every time I say
something nice to you,

39:17.962 --> 39:18.982
you throw up.

39:19.024 --> 39:20.089
It's okay.

39:20.131 --> 39:21.753
I'm not throwing up.

39:30.971 --> 39:32.029
You're in?

39:32.071 --> 39:33.143
I'm in.

39:46.951 --> 39:48.766
How's it going, Mom?

39:51.491 --> 39:54.058
Just going through it all.

39:58.432 --> 40:00.628
Oh, my God.

40:00.670 --> 40:03.289
Dad looks so '90s.

40:04.668 --> 40:06.949
Who are all these people?

40:06.991 --> 40:08.656
I have no idea.

40:10.331 --> 40:11.619
Hmm.

40:17.630 --> 40:19.297
Wait, um...

40:19.339 --> 40:20.878
Oh, my God, that's Emma.

40:20.920 --> 40:22.249
What?

40:22.291 --> 40:23.500
That's... That's Emma!

40:23.542 --> 40:25.965
That's... That's the woman that
came to our house yesterday.
