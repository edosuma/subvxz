Nucky: <i>What do you want,</i>
<i>Chalky?</i>

00:01.694 --> 00:04.761
A club... on the boardwalk
where Babette's used to was.

00:04.796 --> 00:06.496
- A Negro club?
- This an opportunity...

00:06.531 --> 00:09.835
There's a dividing line.
Why is that hard to understand?

00:09.869 --> 00:12.071
Nucky Thompson,
he's a worried man.

00:12.105 --> 00:14.106
I wouldn't know
anything about that.

00:14.141 --> 00:15.475
Well, you
pay him, right?

00:15.509 --> 00:17.344
I mean, he gets his taste
no matter what.

00:17.378 --> 00:19.579
Every business
has its costs.

00:19.614 --> 00:22.115
I wish that
I could kiss you.

00:24.519 --> 00:26.288
How you doin'
in school, Master Samuel?

00:26.322 --> 00:29.825
- I graduate in two and a half years.
- You'll be a doctor.

00:29.859 --> 00:31.994
You'll need to leave first.
I'll follow after.

00:32.028 --> 00:34.097
We leave together,
he'll find out.

00:34.131 --> 00:36.867
I'm pregnant.
It's yours.

00:36.901 --> 00:39.670
50 pounds of heroin,
300 grand.

00:39.704 --> 00:41.939
Nucky Thompson's about
to move on Joe Masseria.

00:41.974 --> 00:44.810
<i>It would be unwise</i>
<i>to venture into any new deals.</i>

00:44.844 --> 00:48.080
300,000. What else do I
get besides a profit?

00:48.115 --> 00:50.716
Nucky Thompson.
He's thinking about making a move.

00:50.750 --> 00:53.085
- On <i>me?</i>
- Do we have a deal or no?

00:53.119 --> 00:54.686
We have deal.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.388
Masseria goes
to the Turkish baths

00:56.422 --> 00:58.123
- <i>every Thursday.</i>
- That might work.

00:58.158 --> 01:00.126
- I'll go with you as backup.
- You're going to Chicago.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.128
- What the hell's in Chicago?
- Johnny Torrio

01:02.162 --> 01:05.031
and, with any luck, an army
of men who'll help us out.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.767
What's going on?

01:06.801 --> 01:08.302
There is
a delivery.

01:09.471 --> 01:10.938
Nucky: <i>Close it up.</i>
<i>Close it!</i>

01:10.972 --> 01:13.640
( sobbing )
No!

Man #2:
<i>We're all set.</i>

03:30.686 --> 03:32.621
<i>( man #3 grunts )</i>
<i>Got it?</i>

03:32.655 --> 03:36.124
- All right. - Easy, easy.
There you go.

03:36.158 --> 03:39.427
- It's done.
- You will keep watch out here.

03:46.403 --> 03:48.504
It is taken care of.

03:48.539 --> 03:50.473
They'll use
the service elevator.

03:50.508 --> 03:53.710
<i>I instructed them</i>
<i>to take it to the warehouse</i>

03:53.745 --> 03:55.746
until a decision is made.

03:55.780 --> 03:58.315
I don't think there
was much notice taken

03:58.349 --> 04:01.118
of the delivery
because of the hour,

04:01.152 --> 04:04.455
- <i>so there is no need...</i>
- Is she gone?

04:04.489 --> 04:08.058
Mrs. Thompson
has left, yes.

04:08.092 --> 04:10.193
The children?

04:10.260 --> 04:14.731
<i>A taxi to the station...</i>
<i>all of them.</i>

04:14.765 --> 04:16.399
And you?

04:17.334 --> 04:19.435
I'm sorry?

04:20.704 --> 04:23.473
You.

04:23.507 --> 04:27.143
Did you know?

04:28.546 --> 04:32.181
- I... I don't understand.
- Owen and my wife.

04:32.216 --> 04:34.317
Did you know?

04:36.653 --> 04:38.387
I tend only to you.

04:38.455 --> 04:42.224
That is all I do.
That is my life.

04:44.594 --> 04:46.028
You need to leave.

04:46.062 --> 04:48.564
- Nucky, please, I beg you...
- <i>It's not safe.</i>

04:48.598 --> 04:51.067
They're coming.
That's what the crate's about.

04:51.101 --> 04:53.436
- You have to go.
- I will not leave you alone.

04:53.470 --> 04:56.539
- There's Gareth and the others.
- They are only men you pay.

04:56.573 --> 04:59.375
- How can you trust them?
- I need to reach Eli.

04:59.409 --> 05:01.343
<i>Get word to Mickey Doyle.</i>

05:01.377 --> 05:03.412
Try Chalky at home.

05:03.446 --> 05:05.080
If he's not there,
call him at his club.

05:05.114 --> 05:07.582
- <i>He can...</i>
- ( clicking )

05:07.617 --> 05:09.417
- What?
- There is nothing.

05:09.452 --> 05:12.054
- You haven't even...
- There is no one. The line is dead.

- <i>Ja.</i>

06:54.022 --> 06:56.624
Everyone knows
this is you.

06:56.658 --> 06:58.559
We don't have time.

07:00.095 --> 07:02.763
Okay... no, no, no, no.
It's okay, it's okay.

07:02.798 --> 07:04.265
You know who I am,
right?

07:04.299 --> 07:06.534
- Yes.
- I need to take your car.

07:06.568 --> 07:08.035
Here, take this.

07:08.103 --> 07:10.004
<i>Here's 500.</i>

Just take it.

- <i>( keys jingle )</i>
- ( groans ) We must go now.

07:22.851 --> 07:24.251
Head to Lolly's.

07:24.286 --> 07:26.120
We'll set up there,
see if the phones work.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.554
I need to reach Eli.

07:27.588 --> 07:29.389
And cash...
I'm going to need cash.

07:29.423 --> 07:31.157
You were right
about the men.

07:31.191 --> 07:33.326
Whoever's left,
they can't be trusted.

07:33.360 --> 07:34.927
I'll have
to tap Chalky,

07:34.962 --> 07:36.529
which'll cost me,
but I'll get it back later.

07:36.563 --> 07:37.797
Just for now I have to...

07:37.831 --> 07:39.031
- what are you doing?!
- <i>( car horn honking )</i>

07:39.065 --> 07:40.266

07:40.300 --> 07:43.068
- ( crashes )
- ( groans )

07:43.103 --> 07:45.838
- Please forgive me.
- What...?

07:47.574 --> 07:49.241
- Nucky: God damn it!
- ( groaning )

07:49.275 --> 07:51.910
I said I didn't want you
getting mixed up.

07:51.944 --> 07:53.712
Come on, I'm going
to move you over.

07:53.746 --> 07:56.548
- I'll drive.

Tonino: <i>We got guys</i>
<i>all over the city.</i>

07:59.352 --> 08:02.387
- <i>We're looking for him.</i>
- Where?

08:02.422 --> 08:04.423
Between the seat cushions?

08:04.457 --> 08:06.692
<i>We think he was hit.</i>
<i>The car's still outside.</i>

08:06.726 --> 08:09.462
- Somebody had to see him.
- Set up a roadblock.

08:09.496 --> 08:11.230
That casino he got.

08:11.297 --> 08:13.165
Check the hospital,
the warehouse.

08:13.199 --> 08:14.999
Tonino: <i>The titsoons?</i>
<i>He's tight with them, too.</i>

08:15.067 --> 08:17.736
Tell them we'll pay.
25,000.

08:17.770 --> 08:19.738
That's a fortune
to a jigaboo.

08:19.772 --> 08:21.640
I want him
in front of me

08:21.674 --> 08:23.709
on his knees
or on a slab.

08:23.743 --> 08:25.410
And find her
something to eat.

08:25.445 --> 08:27.546
- She's starving.
- ( whimpers )

08:29.216 --> 08:31.684
You wanna call Masseria?
Give him the skinny?

08:31.718 --> 08:34.086
I'll have them hook up
the switchboard again.

08:38.692 --> 08:41.360
We're gonna need to call in
his ward heelers, sheriff,

08:41.394 --> 08:43.696
let them know
it's business as usual.

08:47.267 --> 08:49.702
My opinion?

08:49.736 --> 08:51.337
No one wants any fuss.

08:51.371 --> 08:53.172
Just so they see it's in
their best interests...

08:53.240 --> 08:54.774
- Tonino.
- Yeah?

08:54.808 --> 08:56.609
Shut the fuck up.

<i>( carnival music</i>

outta this dump.

09:31.581 --> 09:34.516
- Eddie. - Ja, ja, I will
have it for you immediately.

09:34.584 --> 09:37.385
No, listen to me.
We're at the hospital.

09:37.420 --> 09:39.954
They'll help you, but I'm going
to have to leave you here.

09:40.022 --> 09:42.824
( speaking German )

09:45.195 --> 09:47.563
- ( coughing )
- You. Somebody.

09:47.597 --> 09:50.199
- It's an emergency. I need help with...
- Dr. Landau: <i>Mr. Thompson!</i>

09:50.234 --> 09:53.236
- Dr. Landau.
- What's wrong?

09:53.271 --> 09:54.571
I require discretion here.

09:54.605 --> 09:57.674
He's injured.
It was an accident.

09:57.708 --> 10:00.777
Listen, there's a fucking
wing here named after me.

10:00.812 --> 10:03.079
- Get a goddamn stretcher and...

- Couldn't be helped.

10:42.789 --> 10:44.390
We had business
across town.

10:44.424 --> 10:46.325
Apologies.

10:46.359 --> 10:47.793
You gonna introduce?

10:47.861 --> 10:48.894
Sam Moceri.

10:48.929 --> 10:51.964
Come down from Buffalo,
like I said.

10:52.032 --> 10:53.899
He don't speak?

10:53.934 --> 10:55.868
- I told you about that.
- No.

10:58.906 --> 11:00.740
In Castellammare
years back.

11:00.774 --> 11:02.508
You pinched somebody's
chickens or something, right?

11:02.543 --> 11:05.778
But Magaddino bring
Sam down personal

11:05.846 --> 11:07.380
<i>for this part</i>
<i>of the operation.</i>

11:07.414 --> 11:10.817
- Right.
- <i>Well, here we all are.</i>

11:19.727 --> 11:21.561
It's 200 an ounce.

Straight from China.

11:27.101 --> 11:29.670
<i>( thunderclap )</i>

11:42.918 --> 11:47.422
- The fuck does that mean?
- He said five pounds, $15,000.

11:47.456 --> 11:50.558
And he doesn't appreciate
you being rude.

11:50.592 --> 11:53.227

12:22.325 --> 12:23.725
You were gone all night.

12:23.759 --> 12:26.728
I was beginning to get
rather worried.

12:26.762 --> 12:28.730
I lost track of the time.

12:28.764 --> 12:31.399
That happens
when you're in love.

12:32.401 --> 12:35.870
You are, aren't you?

12:37.439 --> 12:40.241
<i>No need to be</i>
<i>embarrassed.</i>

12:40.275 --> 12:43.044
<i>I envy you a little.</i>

12:44.179 --> 12:46.180
But...

12:47.516 --> 12:49.917
you have to be careful.

12:49.952 --> 12:51.652
About what?

12:51.687 --> 12:53.287
<i>Dreaming about things</i>

A man get himself
killed like that.

14:37.255 --> 14:39.824
I'll keep that
in mind.

14:53.038 --> 14:55.172

15:03.147 --> 15:05.682
Man: <i>Yeah, my cousin Lefty,</i>
<i>he got three, four men</i>

15:20.564 --> 15:24.534
50 men, shotgun,

15:24.568 --> 15:29.238
Thompsons, riding round the street.

No phone in

Word come around
you dead.

15:37.214 --> 15:39.182
Not yet.

15:39.216 --> 15:42.252
Rosetti's here with
Masseria's men, I'm guessing.

15:42.287 --> 15:45.723
They're at the hotel,
the hospital, everywhere.

15:45.757 --> 15:47.991
How many guns
do you have?

15:49.160 --> 15:52.263
Enough for me and mine.

15:52.330 --> 15:54.131
What's that
supposed to mean?

15:54.165 --> 15:57.101
- You come round here
looking for an army? - Yes.

15:57.168 --> 15:59.169
Mm mm mm.

15:59.204 --> 16:01.839
Ain't that just
something fine?

16:01.873 --> 16:04.208
'Cause I ain't heard
one peep about it till now.

This isn't the time

like you ain't say nothing
except "Jump, boy."

16:12.183 --> 16:14.785
I never called you...

16:14.820 --> 16:17.388
Owen is dead.
I can't reach Eli.

16:17.422 --> 16:19.656
Eddie is in the car
with a bullet in his gut.

16:19.691 --> 16:21.124
<i>He needs a doctor.</i>

16:21.159 --> 16:24.361
I came to you for help.

16:25.563 --> 16:28.031
What is it you would
like to do?

16:32.204 --> 16:34.238
Go on now
to fetch him in.

16:34.272 --> 16:36.674
<i>Set up a cot</i>

16:36.708 --> 16:39.610
and stow the car
around back.

16:44.048 --> 16:46.449
You safe here

16:46.483 --> 16:48.084
for the nonce.

16:49.953 --> 16:51.154
- <i>( music playing )</i>
- Gyp: <i>I want it right</i>

16:51.189 --> 16:53.556
<i>in the middle there.</i>
<i>Behind me...peacock feathers.</i>

16:53.590 --> 16:55.224
Tonino: <i>Nice, but where we gonna</i>
<i>find one of those?</i>

16:55.258 --> 16:57.026
Gyp:
<i>On a peacock.</i>

16:57.060 --> 17:00.396
<i>Then I wanna find me one of them</i>
<i>cuckoo clocks, put it in the corner.</i>

17:00.431 --> 17:04.000
- Get the hoes on their toes.
- <i>Sure.</i>

17:04.068 --> 17:05.902
Howdy, Red.

17:05.936 --> 17:07.871
What do you hear?

17:08.939 --> 17:11.273
What an unexpected surprise.

17:11.308 --> 17:13.675
Ain't all surprises
unexpected?

17:13.711 --> 17:15.579
Of course.

17:15.613 --> 17:17.681
That's what makes life
so exciting.

17:17.714 --> 17:19.249
But I thought
Atlantic City

17:19.282 --> 17:21.084
wasn't the best place
for you right now.

17:21.117 --> 17:23.386
Well, I can't think
of anywhere better.

17:23.421 --> 17:25.755
In fact,
I like it so much,

17:25.790 --> 17:28.157
I'm pitching my tent.

17:28.226 --> 17:29.560
Heigh ho.

17:29.594 --> 17:32.463
- <i>( men grunting )</i>
- What is that?

17:32.498 --> 17:35.400
Gyp: <i>Nucky's desk</i>
<i>from the Ritz.</i>

17:35.434 --> 17:38.169
- Easy, easy.
- He won't need it no more.

17:38.204 --> 17:40.138
What happened to him?

17:40.172 --> 17:42.507
Same thing happens
to everyone,

17:42.542 --> 17:44.643
just sooner.

17:45.678 --> 17:49.614
- Mr. Rosetti...
- Ah ah ah ah.

17:51.084 --> 17:53.185
Gyp.

17:54.754 --> 17:56.355
Gyp.

17:58.825 --> 18:01.928
You're always
a welcome guest here,

18:01.962 --> 18:03.596
but I have
a business to run.

18:03.630 --> 18:05.798
And you'll keep on
runnin' it.

18:05.833 --> 18:08.101
Everything gonna
stay the same.

18:08.135 --> 18:12.273
Only now you'll have
a pal in charge.

18:12.307 --> 18:16.310
What do you say,
Strawberry?

18:19.781 --> 18:22.516
It's what I've always
hoped for.

18:23.751 --> 18:26.186
Well, how about
some breakfast, then, huh?

18:26.220 --> 18:29.522
We've been on the go
since midnight.

18:29.556 --> 18:31.457
Make yourselves
at home,

18:31.492 --> 18:35.094
and we'll do whatever we can to
see that you're comfortable.

18:42.936 --> 18:45.203
Tommy is not
to come down here.

18:45.238 --> 18:47.939
Keep him in his room.
Lock the door.

18:47.973 --> 18:51.108
( men grunting )

18:54.879 --> 18:56.881
- Man: <i>He's not here.</i>
- Just put him on the line.

18:56.915 --> 18:58.349
<i>I just told you</i>
<i>he's not here.</i>

18:58.383 --> 19:00.818
Look, I know
Torrio's bullshit.

19:00.852 --> 19:02.419
Tell him to pick up
the phone.

19:02.454 --> 19:04.655
<i>Who are you again?</i>

19:04.689 --> 19:06.957
- Where's Capone?
- <i>Thought you said Torrio.</i>

19:06.991 --> 19:09.893
I want you
to listen closely.

19:09.928 --> 19:11.396
My brother is there.

19:11.430 --> 19:13.865
You find him.
You put him on.

19:13.899 --> 19:15.599
<i>Nah, there's</i>
<i>nobody's brother.</i>

19:15.667 --> 19:17.467
Elias Thompson.

19:17.502 --> 19:19.303
He's there.

19:19.337 --> 19:21.505
He has to call me at...

19:21.539 --> 19:24.240
- What's the number?
- You don't know it?

19:24.275 --> 19:25.808
Eddie does.

19:25.843 --> 19:27.377
One triple eight.

19:27.411 --> 19:29.178
Marine one
eight eight eight.

19:29.213 --> 19:30.713
- You got that?
- <i>( clicks )</i>

19:30.747 --> 19:33.782
Hello? Hello?

19:39.122 --> 19:41.089
We dug him up.

19:45.195 --> 19:47.397
This one big favor.

19:47.431 --> 19:49.799
You understand?

19:53.304 --> 19:55.439
Master Samuel.

19:57.942 --> 20:00.110
You know what
I need you to do?

20:01.179 --> 20:03.547
I have some idea, sir.

20:03.581 --> 20:05.549
This strictly between us.

20:05.583 --> 20:08.385
Maybelle, your folks...

20:08.419 --> 20:10.888
this here ain't none
of their business.

20:12.023 --> 20:14.458
I'll make it worth your while.

20:17.762 --> 20:19.863
Let me see him.

20:19.897 --> 20:23.033
- ( flies buzzing )
- ( murmuring )

20:24.702 --> 20:27.004
I don't know what I can do.

20:27.038 --> 20:28.872
You're a doctor, aren't you?

20:28.973 --> 20:30.540
I'm a medical student.

20:30.575 --> 20:32.610
And this man needs
to be in a hospital.

20:32.644 --> 20:34.879
Can't take him
to no hospital.

20:34.913 --> 20:37.114
Gonna have to
be right here.

20:37.149 --> 20:38.816
In the kitchen?

20:40.853 --> 20:43.322
( murmuring continues )

20:43.356 --> 20:44.957
I can clean out
his wound,

20:44.991 --> 20:47.927
try to control
the bleeding.

20:47.961 --> 20:50.163
( speaking German,
moaning )

20:50.197 --> 20:53.833
The rest...
I don't know.

20:55.002 --> 20:57.604
This could ruin me.
You realize that?

20:57.638 --> 21:01.808
We all take care
of each other, son.

21:01.842 --> 21:03.476
That's how it work.

21:08.183 --> 21:10.284
Fill up as many pots
as you have.

21:10.319 --> 21:11.819
Get them boiling.

21:11.854 --> 21:15.123
Sheets, towels, tablecloths,
anything that's clean.

21:15.157 --> 21:17.325
There's no ether,
of course,

21:17.359 --> 21:20.828
so I strongly suggest
you get him drunk.

21:23.999 --> 21:25.433
Wash your hands, please.

21:25.467 --> 21:27.902
I'm going to need help.
Bring me alcohol.

21:27.936 --> 21:30.171
Sanitize my instrument.

21:35.710 --> 21:37.677
Come on,
it's 15 grand.

21:37.712 --> 21:39.813
Meyer: <i>I don't know</i>
<i>Magaddino.</i>

21:39.847 --> 21:41.714
Yes, you do.

21:41.749 --> 21:44.217
I don't know him,
Charlie.

21:45.219 --> 21:47.620
All right.
Well, I do.

21:49.223 --> 21:50.623
And there's
50 pounds of white

21:50.657 --> 21:52.324
we borrowed big
from Masseria for.

21:52.358 --> 21:54.459
We gotta start
moving it,

21:54.493 --> 21:56.194
'cause what
we gotta pay off...

21:56.228 --> 21:57.862
You didn't hear
what happened last night?

21:57.897 --> 22:00.098
Your mother served pork chops?
How the fuck do I know?

22:00.132 --> 22:02.567
Nucky's lrishman,
he went after Masseria.

22:02.602 --> 22:04.769
They sent him back
in a box.

22:06.805 --> 22:09.474
Whichever way it goes,
we need to be very careful now

22:09.508 --> 22:11.476
about who people see us
do business with.

22:11.510 --> 22:12.977
He's from Buffalo, Meyer.

22:13.012 --> 22:15.413
And it's 15 grand.

22:15.447 --> 22:17.548
<i>Okay, look.</i>

22:17.583 --> 22:19.283
<i>I couldn't fucking</i>
<i>sleep last night</i>

22:19.318 --> 22:21.753
when I was running the numbers
on what we're gonna owe.

22:21.787 --> 22:24.656
You don't think I remember?
Down to the penny?

22:28.861 --> 22:31.796
Everything connects,
Charlie,

22:31.831 --> 22:33.898
whether you know it
or not.

22:33.966 --> 22:38.537
You need to stop
and think it through.

22:43.643 --> 22:45.611
All right?

22:52.853 --> 22:54.921
You're making
my head hurt.

22:55.022 --> 22:56.956
Let this one go.

22:59.793 --> 23:02.295
- Yeah.
- I'm serious.

23:02.363 --> 23:04.831
I said yeah.

23:09.436 --> 23:13.072
- What's his name?
- Eddie.

23:13.140 --> 23:15.308
I can't call him that.

23:15.376 --> 23:18.044
Kessler.

23:18.078 --> 23:20.880
Mr. Kessler,
can you hear me?

23:20.948 --> 23:24.184
( murmuring in German )

23:24.219 --> 23:25.753
What's that?

23:25.787 --> 23:27.788
It's just something
he's been babbling.

23:27.823 --> 23:31.326
( German continues )

23:31.360 --> 23:33.128
Give him
some more whiskey.

23:33.162 --> 23:35.330
He's on the verge
of alcohol poisoning already.

23:35.398 --> 23:38.199
<i>( Eddie speaking German )</i>

23:38.234 --> 23:40.034
Okay, okay.

23:40.068 --> 23:42.337
Get started.

23:46.441 --> 23:49.310
I'll need you both
to hold him down.

23:52.914 --> 23:55.015
( screaming )

23:55.049 --> 23:56.717
- Hold him.
- ( crying )

23:56.751 --> 23:58.318
<i>Hold him!</i>

24:01.021 --> 24:03.055
Okay, all right.

24:08.528 --> 24:11.197
( screaming )

24:17.973 --> 24:20.074
It's in deep.

24:21.109 --> 24:22.509
<i>( Eddie yelling )</i>

24:22.544 --> 24:26.246
<i>( car pulls up,</i>
<i>dogs barking )</i>

24:29.784 --> 24:31.618
You expecting
somebody?

24:35.222 --> 24:37.690
Gyp:
<i>Chalky White!</i>

24:37.724 --> 24:40.860
<i>Paging</i>
<i>Mr. Chalky White!</i>

24:48.835 --> 24:52.004
- <i>( Eddie groans )</i>
- Shh.

24:52.038 --> 24:55.006
Y'all keep him quiet.

25:02.648 --> 25:04.949
Should... should
I keep going?

25:10.922 --> 25:12.523
( muffled screaming )

25:12.591 --> 25:14.658
Shh.

25:35.579 --> 25:39.048
Giuseppe Colombano
Rosetti.

25:39.116 --> 25:42.052
My friends call me Gyp.

25:42.086 --> 25:43.787
How do I address you?

25:43.821 --> 25:45.355
You doin' it.

25:45.390 --> 25:48.959
( chuckles )
I'm doin' it.

25:48.994 --> 25:50.427
Okay.

25:50.462 --> 25:53.031
You know what's going on,
don't you, around here?

25:53.065 --> 25:56.768
Some kind of ruckus over
on the white part of town.

25:56.803 --> 25:58.804
That's all done now.

25:58.838 --> 26:00.405
I'm gonna be
running things.

26:00.440 --> 26:02.174
People tell me
you the man to see

26:02.208 --> 26:04.743
on this side
of the fence.

26:04.778 --> 26:06.846
I come to pay
my respects,

26:06.913 --> 26:10.082
<i>Mr. White.</i>

26:10.116 --> 26:13.518
Do we really need
all these guns?

26:16.989 --> 26:19.892
Not if you put
yours down first.

26:44.285 --> 26:46.119
Look at us now.

26:46.154 --> 26:48.554
We're almost kissing.

26:48.589 --> 26:51.224
- ( muffled screaming )
- Okay, okay.

26:51.258 --> 26:53.425
All right.

26:53.460 --> 26:55.260
( muffled screaming )

26:55.328 --> 26:58.531
Nucky: <i>Okay, okay, it's out.</i>
<i>It's out, Eddie.</i>

27:01.135 --> 27:03.970
I'm not looking to put
my hand in your pockets.

27:04.004 --> 27:07.774
However things used to work,
I don't operate that way.

27:07.808 --> 27:10.844
I mean, look at me,
look at you.

27:10.879 --> 27:12.947
We got a lot
in common, huh?

27:12.981 --> 27:14.848
And what's that?

27:14.916 --> 27:17.951
We both got left out
in the sun too long.

27:19.754 --> 27:22.856
Maybe you
a little longer, huh?

27:22.891 --> 27:25.593
You just ain't done
cooking yet, friend.

27:28.330 --> 27:31.032
I'm gonna
treat you good.

27:31.066 --> 27:33.034
Better than you been
treated before.

27:33.068 --> 27:35.203
That's all I come to say.

27:36.538 --> 27:38.973
Can we shake on that?

27:44.679 --> 27:47.081
Oh, one more thing.

27:47.115 --> 27:50.685
How about I slip 25 Gs
in your pocket right now,

27:50.719 --> 27:54.788
you let me walk in there, drag
Nucky Thompson out by his dick?

27:54.823 --> 27:56.957
Chalky:
<i>What make you think he here?</i>

27:56.992 --> 28:00.127
<i>( conversation continues</i>
<i>indistinctly )</i>

28:00.162 --> 28:02.597
If I don't
stitch him up now,

28:02.631 --> 28:05.267
he won't last
another five minutes.

28:15.678 --> 28:17.779
( muffled screaming )

28:17.813 --> 28:20.382
What do you say?

28:20.416 --> 28:23.418
I ain't seen Nucky
going on three weeks now.

28:23.452 --> 28:27.088
- That's not what I heard.
- Oh, you heard wrong.

28:27.123 --> 28:31.126
I pay that man his cut and
he leave me to my business.

28:31.160 --> 28:33.895
Now what happen to him
ain't none of my concern.

28:33.930 --> 28:37.833
Still, I'll go on in
and take a look.

28:37.867 --> 28:39.235
Huh?

28:39.269 --> 28:42.071
- ( muffled screaming )
- Gyp: <i>One way or the other,</i>

28:42.105 --> 28:45.008
<i>I'll still pass you</i>
<i>the 25 Gs</i>

28:45.075 --> 28:46.943
<i>as a gesture.</i>

28:50.281 --> 28:53.150
Got a little private affair
going on right now.

28:53.184 --> 28:55.986
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

28:56.021 --> 28:59.223
And I'd like it
to stay private.

28:59.257 --> 29:00.925
She see all y'all gents
marching in,

29:00.959 --> 29:02.526
gonna cost me
more than money.

29:02.561 --> 29:05.429
That's something else
we got in common.

29:05.464 --> 29:07.498
We're both romantics.

29:07.532 --> 29:09.566
Well, maybe you is.

29:09.601 --> 29:13.104
I just aim to keep my johnson
hanging in its rightful place.

29:13.138 --> 29:16.374
I know some skirts
like that, too.

29:21.839 --> 29:23.806
$25,000.

29:23.841 --> 29:27.543
<i>Nucky Thompson.</i>
<i>Tell your friends.</i>

29:30.079 --> 29:32.914
( sniffing )

29:35.150 --> 29:37.818
I really want us
to get along.

29:52.063 --> 29:54.230
Look like we gonna
need some more guns.

29:54.264 --> 29:56.566
Mm-hmm.

30:06.308 --> 30:09.610
You can take
your hand off now.

30:09.645 --> 30:12.314
Unless you intend
to asphyxiate him.

30:12.348 --> 30:15.217
Dunn: <i>You, make sure</i>
<i>they don't come back.</i>

30:15.251 --> 30:17.118
Will he live?

30:18.621 --> 30:21.189
I'm just a student.

30:31.633 --> 30:34.536
25 grand
to give you up.

30:34.570 --> 30:37.372
That's a whole lot of money
on the Northside.

30:37.406 --> 30:39.907
I'll pay you.
Is that what you want to hear?

30:39.942 --> 30:42.643
I ain't talking
about me.

30:42.677 --> 30:44.211
You trust your men?

30:44.246 --> 30:47.148
I don't trust nobody,
Nucky, never did.

30:47.182 --> 30:49.550
Get me out of here.

30:49.585 --> 30:50.985
You can name
your price.

30:51.020 --> 30:54.655
- I already named it.
- The club?

30:54.690 --> 30:57.658
On the Boardwalk?

30:57.692 --> 31:01.028
How can I give you
what I don't own anymore?

31:01.063 --> 31:03.163
( scoffs )

31:05.700 --> 31:08.536
What about him?

31:08.570 --> 31:10.571
( sighs )

31:10.605 --> 31:12.640
Just take him
somewhere safe.

31:12.674 --> 31:15.910
- See that he's comfortable.
- He got any family?

31:22.484 --> 31:24.152
I don't know.

31:27.756 --> 31:29.557
( harp twanging )

31:29.591 --> 31:32.860
- <i>( men chattering )</i>
- <i>( music playing )</i>

31:42.137 --> 31:43.737
Let's go upstairs.

31:43.772 --> 31:45.472
Come with me.
Come on.

31:45.507 --> 31:47.575
Let's go.

31:55.885 --> 31:58.219
- The fuck?
- What do you think you're doing?

31:58.254 --> 31:59.988
- I told him we had to go upstairs.
- Who gives a fuck?

32:00.022 --> 32:02.024
It's all
the same cathouse.

32:07.096 --> 32:08.663
You want some, too?

32:13.234 --> 32:15.302
I'll tell Mr. Rosetti.

32:15.336 --> 32:18.172
Hey, she'll tell
Mr. Rosetti.

32:18.206 --> 32:21.375
<i>( men laughing )</i>

32:34.523 --> 32:37.259
What are you doing?

32:37.293 --> 32:40.628
Just a walk
around the grounds.

32:48.570 --> 32:50.705
You say it, dear,

32:50.739 --> 32:53.274
but tell the truth.

32:53.308 --> 32:55.809
You know
that's always best.

32:57.212 --> 33:00.214
We're going to Julia's.

33:00.248 --> 33:02.349
Oh.

33:04.085 --> 33:06.053
Is that her name?

33:09.123 --> 33:11.491
It's an innocent question.

33:13.327 --> 33:15.128
Yes.

33:16.797 --> 33:19.606
Pretty girl,
pretty name.

33:20.709 --> 33:22.443
She doesn't look blind.

33:24.112 --> 33:25.346
In the photograph.

33:25.414 --> 33:29.117
That's mine.
My life.

33:29.151 --> 33:30.885
You have no right.

33:34.157 --> 33:37.259
I know it isn't fun
to be stuck inside,

33:37.293 --> 33:40.462
but sometimes
we have to put up

33:40.496 --> 33:42.664
with things
that we don't like

33:42.699 --> 33:45.434
in order to get
what we want.

33:45.468 --> 33:47.837
So jacket off.

33:47.871 --> 33:50.173
Hang it up neatly.

33:50.241 --> 33:53.410
Go on.
Ice cream later.

33:57.848 --> 33:59.649
Could you two
come in here?

33:59.684 --> 34:01.284
Please.

34:04.689 --> 34:07.057
What's the problem?

34:07.091 --> 34:09.159
I'm hoping
there isn't one.

34:11.329 --> 34:14.097
I tried to explain
to you this morning.

34:14.130 --> 34:17.567
I suppose you
didn't understand.

34:17.601 --> 34:19.536
I have to
remind myself

34:19.570 --> 34:21.938
you're not really
a complete person.

34:21.973 --> 34:24.074
He doesn't belong here.

34:24.108 --> 34:26.076
Of course he does.

34:26.143 --> 34:28.379
This is the only
home he has,

34:28.413 --> 34:31.547
not in some fantasy
world of yours.

34:32.717 --> 34:35.686
Mr. Rosetti wants
this man gone.

34:37.456 --> 34:39.056
He didn't say
nothing to us.

34:39.091 --> 34:41.359
He couldn't
have been clearer.

34:44.030 --> 34:47.766
You lied to me, Richard.

34:47.833 --> 34:49.835
That's what hurts the most.

35:12.457 --> 35:14.258
- 25 grand.
- That's a lot of money.

35:14.292 --> 35:17.828
- 25,000.

35:38.551 --> 35:42.520
Should I b-bring
the car?

35:42.555 --> 35:45.690
No. No, I don't
need the car.

But... but how...
how will...

35:49.295 --> 35:51.830
how will you go
to the theater?

35:51.864 --> 35:54.333
I'm not going
to a show tonight.

35:54.367 --> 35:56.135
Oh.

35:56.169 --> 35:59.071
Then... then I will see

35:59.105 --> 36:01.707
It's all right.
It's all right.

36:03.343 --> 36:05.311
You...

36:07.815 --> 36:10.183
you can have
the evening off.

36:10.251 --> 36:11.985
No, no, no.

36:12.020 --> 36:15.389
There is still
too much to do.

36:16.658 --> 36:18.692
Eddie,

36:18.726 --> 36:21.862
do you have
any family?

36:21.896 --> 36:24.398
Yes, of course.

36:24.466 --> 36:27.201
A... a wife.

36:27.235 --> 36:29.336
Two boys.
