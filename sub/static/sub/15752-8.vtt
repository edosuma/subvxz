WEBVTT

00:08.276 --> 00:11.312
I'm gonna get the 900
no matter how long it takes.

00:11.412 --> 00:12.646
I'm just gonna
put on a diaper

00:12.746 --> 00:13.747
and sit here
till tomorrow.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.149
You can't afford diapers.

00:15.249 --> 00:16.550
I never said
I was gonna buy one.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.586
Anything could be used
as a diaper.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.054
- You want some of this?
- No, no, it's okay.

00:20.154 --> 00:21.255
I got a big day
at work tomorrow.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.023
- Oh, work's for jerks!
- Lame!

00:23.124 --> 00:25.059
- It's tomorrow.
- Okay.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.096
[coughs]

00:28.196 --> 00:31.232
Oh, my God, dudes.
This game is so old school.

00:31.332 --> 00:32.833
Listen to that music.

00:32.933 --> 00:34.935
Oh, yeah.
Super old school.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.037
Like, middle school.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.506
[laughs]

00:38.606 --> 00:40.908
Yep, just about right--
right around there.

00:41.008 --> 00:42.910
Hey, I remember when
this game came out, man,

00:43.010 --> 00:44.412
I didn't even skate
or anything.

00:44.512 --> 00:46.046
I used to skateboard
when I was a kid.

00:46.147 --> 00:47.248
I was pretty decent too.

00:47.348 --> 00:49.383
Oh, yeah?
I love that.

00:49.483 --> 00:51.385
Just picture you
in, like, tube socks

00:51.485 --> 00:53.020
and checkered Vans.

00:53.121 --> 00:54.755
[laughs]

00:54.855 --> 00:56.924
And pigtails
like Punky Brewster.

00:57.024 --> 00:58.192
[laughs]

00:58.292 --> 00:59.627
Like what?

00:59.727 --> 01:02.896
Uh, like--
like a funky rooster.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.601
You're so baked.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.837
Uh!
Come on!

01:09.937 --> 01:11.772
You suck.
Hey, Liza's turn.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.507
Oh, no, no, it's okay.
I don't play video games.

01:13.607 --> 01:14.708
What do you mean?

01:14.808 --> 01:16.877
My parents didn't
allow them.

01:16.977 --> 01:18.446
That's, like,
child abuse.

01:18.546 --> 01:21.282
I mean, you've played
something though, right?

01:21.382 --> 01:22.950
Like, Mario Kart
at a friend's house.

01:23.050 --> 01:24.285
No, I haven't.

01:24.385 --> 01:25.853
What about, like,
Candy Crush?

01:25.953 --> 01:27.555
Sorry.

01:27.655 --> 01:29.923
So you're a video game
virgin.

01:30.023 --> 01:31.792
Is that a big deal?

01:31.892 --> 01:33.594
Not if you're Amish.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.028
Look, okay, I don't want
to be a bad influence,

01:35.163 --> 01:36.630
so I'm just gonna
take your turn.

01:36.730 --> 01:37.698
You don't want to get
started on this stuff.

01:37.798 --> 01:39.167
No, you're not.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.302
Take this.
Here.

01:41.402 --> 01:43.937
It's easy once you
get a hang of it.

01:44.037 --> 01:44.938
Grab the controller.

01:45.038 --> 01:47.175
Firmly?

01:47.241 --> 01:49.243
Yeah, firmly.

01:49.343 --> 01:52.213
This--this button
right here

01:52.313 --> 01:54.948
makes you move forward
and backward.

01:55.048 --> 01:57.985
I like moving
forward and backward.

01:58.085 --> 02:00.688
And what does
this button on the tip do?

02:00.788 --> 02:03.191
What if I touch

02:03.224 --> 02:05.326
just the tip?

02:05.426 --> 02:06.560
Yeah.

02:06.660 --> 02:12.400
It's all yours, big guy.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.801
What happened to the door?

02:13.901 --> 02:15.903
Oh, we--
we broke it wrestling.

02:16.003 --> 02:17.405
We're using it
as a table.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.039
You should've
totally been there.

02:19.207 --> 02:20.441
Next time.

02:20.541 --> 02:21.742
We can't.
They're right there.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.577
They're fine.

02:23.677 --> 02:25.213
They won't lift their heads
from that game for hours.

02:25.313 --> 02:26.714
It's fine, it's fine.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.749
All right, I think
I'm gonna take a rain check.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.083
Or a door check.

02:30.218 --> 02:31.385
Or we could go
check the shower.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.621
Mm, you have mushrooms
growing on the tub.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.589
It's okay.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.991
I really do have a big day
at work tomorrow.

02:38.091 --> 02:39.727
Work is a four-letter word.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.362
So is door.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.500
[groans]

02:48.001 --> 02:49.537
Bye, boys.

02:52.273 --> 02:53.741
*

02:53.841 --> 02:55.743
We need a new door.

02:55.843 --> 02:58.746
[guitar rock music]

02:58.846 --> 03:06.920
*

03:08.822 --> 03:09.990
Skinny cap,

03:10.090 --> 03:10.991
low foam.

03:11.091 --> 03:13.661
And I got you both

03:13.761 --> 03:16.664
bold control
and high lift L'OrÃ©al.

03:16.764 --> 03:20.167
Oh, and Nina from publicity
wants to know the exact name

03:20.268 --> 03:23.136
of the honor Bjornberg is
receiving at the PEN awards.

03:23.271 --> 03:25.406
The Scandinavian Prize.

03:25.506 --> 03:28.576
And does PEN stand for "poets,
essayists, and novelists,"

03:28.676 --> 03:30.678
or, "playwrights,
essayists, and novelist"?

03:30.778 --> 03:32.446
She didn't ask that,
did she?

03:32.546 --> 03:34.682
Well, apparently there's
some confusion on Wikipedia.

03:34.782 --> 03:37.518
Apparently,
publicity is incapable

03:37.618 --> 03:39.086
of doing anything
on their own.

03:39.186 --> 03:40.354
Well, I think it's
just because

03:40.454 --> 03:42.089
Nina just had eye surgery

03:42.189 --> 03:44.124
and her cat has a urinary
tract infection, so she--

03:44.292 --> 03:46.927
Liza, this is the most important
literary event of the season.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.195
Don't get sidetracked.

03:48.296 --> 03:49.830
I need you to
triple-check everything,

03:49.930 --> 03:51.765
especially social media.

03:51.865 --> 03:54.101
I have. All the live tweets
you've approved are ready to go.

03:54.201 --> 03:55.869
Did you check Empirical's
table placement?

03:55.969 --> 03:57.538
We have two
right near the stage.

03:57.638 --> 03:59.940
Good, I want the heavy hitters
to see that we have Bjornberg.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.909
Just finished the final edit
on Anton's speech,

04:02.009 --> 04:02.910
and I emailed it to you.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.111
Is he nervous?

04:04.211 --> 04:06.046
Only about finding
the perfect tux,

04:06.146 --> 04:07.981
so I'm going
to help him now.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.350
Black tie means black tie.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.385
No color.
This isn't the Grammys!

04:13.086 --> 04:14.688
Is transportation set?

04:14.788 --> 04:16.790
Yes, and all the cars have
umbrellas in case it rains.

04:16.890 --> 04:17.958
Good.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.593
I need you
to make sure Bjornberg

04:19.692 --> 04:21.595
has a place to smoke
after the red carpet,

04:21.695 --> 04:23.364
pick up my dress
from the dry cleaners.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.799
Oh, Bjornberg's wife
is flying in to surprise him,

04:25.899 --> 04:27.635
so take the town car,
escort her to the hotel,

04:27.735 --> 04:29.337
and make sure she has
everything she needs.

04:29.437 --> 04:30.771
Bjornberg's wife
is coming here?

04:30.871 --> 04:32.506
Yes, but, shh,
it's a surprise.

04:35.809 --> 04:38.011
(Bjornberg)
Kelsey, can you come
and take a look at this?

04:38.111 --> 04:40.881
Yeah.

04:40.981 --> 04:41.882
Wow.

04:41.982 --> 04:42.916
Wow.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.074

04:51.124 --> 04:53.961
[moaning]

04:54.061 --> 04:55.563
(woman)
Is everything okay in there?

04:55.663 --> 04:58.366
Uh, yeah.

04:58.399 --> 05:01.769
(Kelsey)
We, um, are just checking
the fit of the--of the pant.

05:01.869 --> 05:03.371
(Anton)
Go, go, go.

05:03.471 --> 05:04.438
Okay, okay, okay.

05:07.941 --> 05:10.444
They're great.
We'll take 'em.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.112
Excellent.

05:12.212 --> 05:13.914
[cell phone chimes]

05:18.586 --> 05:19.887
His wife is coming?

05:19.987 --> 05:21.389
Yeah, aren't you glad
I found out now,

05:21.455 --> 05:22.990
before she just
showed up at the awards?

05:23.090 --> 05:23.991
Yeah.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.025
Why would she do that?

05:25.125 --> 05:26.527
Because she's his wife,

05:26.627 --> 05:28.796
and she wants to share
his life with him?

05:28.896 --> 05:31.399
I guess I never really
thought about his wife.

05:31.499 --> 05:33.000
That was the great part.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.402
She's in Sweden.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.203
Yeah, no one ever
thinks about the wife.

05:36.303 --> 05:38.071
All the sacrifices
she's made,

05:38.171 --> 05:40.541
all the dinners she's cooked,
all the toilets she's cleaned.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.209
If this woman finds out
about the affair,

05:42.309 --> 05:43.644
she's gonna be devastated.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.479
Girls in their 20s
don't think about that.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.748
"Girls in their 20s"?

05:47.848 --> 05:49.983
You're in your 20s.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.552
Yeah, but I'm very mature.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.421
I spent a lot of years
meditating.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.489
I just don't get it.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.190
What's in this for you?

05:57.290 --> 05:59.159
What?
Are you kidding me?

05:59.259 --> 06:01.128
He's this brilliant writer

06:01.228 --> 06:02.996
who happens to be
amazing in bed.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.832
I'm not gonna
pass that up.

06:04.932 --> 06:08.168
And by the way,
isn't Anton's wife his problem?

06:08.268 --> 06:10.137
Yeah, but who's
problem is Thad?

06:10.237 --> 06:12.005
If Thad and I
are gonna be together,

06:12.105 --> 06:14.207
I'm probably gonna be
happy I had the affair.

06:14.307 --> 06:16.076
I don't want to be
one of those women

06:16.176 --> 06:18.446
who wakes up at 40 and realizes
she forgot to have a life.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.847
Okay, Kelsey,

06:19.947 --> 06:22.349
I'm your friend,
but I got to tell you,

06:22.450 --> 06:25.085
your adventure with Bjornberg
has collateral damage.

06:25.185 --> 06:26.520
[cell phone chimes]

06:26.620 --> 06:29.356
And I got to go pick her up
at the airport.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.234
Thank you so much
for meeting me.

06:41.334 --> 06:44.037
Please, let me
treat you to lunch.

06:44.137 --> 06:46.239
I can't. I have to get
back to the office.

06:46.339 --> 06:48.542
There's, like, a million errands
to do before the awards tonight.

06:48.642 --> 06:51.078
You must take 20 minutes
for a bite to eat.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.846
I insist.
Come.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.114
Okay.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.585
And the linguini
with clam sauce for you.

06:57.685 --> 06:58.586
Thank you.

06:58.686 --> 06:59.687
More jasmine iced tea?

06:59.787 --> 07:02.189
Uh, please.

07:02.289 --> 07:03.657
This is heaven.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.159
Well, you assistants--
you take care of everyone.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.562
You deserve to be taken
care of once in a while.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.263
Not everyone
thinks that way.

07:10.363 --> 07:12.099
Well, I remember very well

07:12.199 --> 07:14.067
what it's like to have
these jobs in your 20s.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.171
You're in your 20s,
Liza, yes?

07:18.271 --> 07:20.373
Yes, I'm 26.

07:20.508 --> 07:22.676
You're so lovely.

07:22.776 --> 07:26.179
Your eyes--they're
very much like doe eyes.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.915
Has anyone ever
said that to you before?

07:28.015 --> 07:30.518
Maybe.

07:30.618 --> 07:32.853
My husband said you've been
showing him such hospitality

07:32.953 --> 07:34.522
while he's been here
in New York.

07:34.555 --> 07:37.390
The whole company
is so happy to have him.

07:37.525 --> 07:39.026
My husband--

07:39.126 --> 07:41.228
he started writing
his new novel.

07:41.328 --> 07:43.430
He sends me
all the pages.

07:43.531 --> 07:44.532
Wow, that's exciting.

07:44.565 --> 07:45.866
Yes, it is.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.300
And, of course,
you know that

07:47.400 --> 07:49.402
Anton always writes
from his real experiences.

07:49.537 --> 07:53.406
And this is about his
experiences here in New York.

07:53.541 --> 07:55.042
Would you like me
to read you some?

07:55.142 --> 07:56.544
Sure.

07:59.880 --> 08:04.351
[speaking in Swedish]

08:04.451 --> 08:06.453
I'm so sorry.
I don't speak Swedish.

08:06.554 --> 08:09.923
[shouting in Swedish]

08:14.995 --> 08:16.096
What--what--
what's going on?

08:16.196 --> 08:17.931
Don't pretend
you don't know!

08:18.031 --> 08:19.867
He writes about you.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.569
His 26-year-old mistress

08:21.635 --> 08:24.371
who works as an assistant
in a publishing house!

08:24.471 --> 08:25.706
He wrote about that?

08:25.806 --> 08:26.740
So you admit it?

08:26.840 --> 08:28.108
No, no, no--
it's not me.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.577
Oh, it's not you,
with the doe eyes?

08:29.643 --> 08:33.480
[speaking in Swedish]

08:33.581 --> 08:34.748
A what?

08:34.847 --> 08:37.751
A vagina as soft
as a walrus' fold.

08:37.851 --> 08:41.722
[shouting in Swedish]

08:41.822 --> 08:42.756
You!

08:42.856 --> 08:44.958
You stay away
from my husband!

08:54.067 --> 08:56.169
I just had lunch
with Bjornberg's wife.

08:56.269 --> 08:57.805
Is she pretty?

08:57.905 --> 08:59.439
- Not when she's hitting me.
- What?

08:59.607 --> 09:01.208
She knows he's having
an affair.

09:01.308 --> 09:03.744
She thinks I'm the one
he's sleeping with.

09:03.844 --> 09:05.613
What would make her
think that?

09:05.679 --> 09:06.947
He wrote about it
in his new book.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.216
He said his mistress
has doe eyes

09:09.316 --> 09:11.852
and a vagina as soft
as a walrus' fold.

09:11.952 --> 09:14.722
Okay, something must have
gotten lost in translation.

09:14.822 --> 09:17.457
Kelsey, this is serious.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.927
I know, I know.

09:20.027 --> 09:21.428
I have to break things off
with Anton.

09:21.528 --> 09:22.630
But I can't right now.

09:22.730 --> 09:24.297
The PEN awards
are in, like, an hour.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.633
I just don't--

09:25.699 --> 09:26.800
[knock on door]

09:26.900 --> 09:28.235
Oh, here you are.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.737
In an entirely
different department

09:29.837 --> 09:31.371
than the one
that employs you.

09:31.471 --> 09:33.106
You're supposed to be
helping me get ready.

09:36.343 --> 09:37.645
Did you get everything
on the list?

09:37.745 --> 09:40.447
Yes, I got your fake eyelashes
and your SPANX.

09:40.547 --> 09:41.649
Shh, shh, shh.
Charles.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.784
Hi. Hi, Dana.

09:43.884 --> 09:45.786
And Liza, right?

09:45.886 --> 09:47.220
Right.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.089
Looking forward to
the PEN awards tonight?

09:49.189 --> 09:51.992
Yeah, I am looking forward
to seeing the Knopf table

09:52.092 --> 09:54.662
applaud our star
Bjornberg.

09:54.695 --> 09:57.097
Maybe we can share
a town car over.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.466
I can't. I have to go home
and meet the new babysitter.

09:59.566 --> 10:02.435
Oh, I understand.
Well, see you there.

10:02.535 --> 10:03.871
Yep.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.774
Is he looking?

10:06.874 --> 10:08.408
He sure is.

10:08.508 --> 10:10.443
No, don't look.
You'll ruin the moment.

10:16.516 --> 10:18.085
Did you make sure I was
seated next to him?

10:18.185 --> 10:19.086
Weeks ago.

10:19.186 --> 10:20.087
Did you--

10:20.187 --> 10:21.488
I reconfirmed it
today.

10:21.588 --> 10:23.356
I feel sorry for him
about the divorce,

10:23.456 --> 10:25.358
but I can't say I'm not thrilled
he's on the market.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.526
He does seem nice.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.528
Nice?
Are you kidding me?

10:28.628 --> 10:31.031
He's straight, handsome,
intellectual, and available.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.766
Do you realize
how rare that is?

10:32.866 --> 10:34.835
It's like finding a snow leopard
in your backyard.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.937
Oh, come on.
It's not that bad.

10:37.037 --> 10:39.372
You have no idea what it's like
to be single and in your 40s.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.508
It's like trying to rent out
a beautiful apartment

10:41.608 --> 10:43.376
where a murder took place--
everyone's spooked.

10:43.476 --> 10:46.279
I kick myself for all those
years I wasted with Philip Roth.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.515
Have I mentioned that I was
involved with Philip Roth?

10:48.615 --> 10:50.383
Several times.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.985
I was.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.055
Hey.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.090
I hate being 26.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.558
What happened?

10:58.658 --> 10:59.893
Should I start
with how I had

10:59.993 --> 11:01.729
to pluck a chin hair
from my boss' face,

11:01.795 --> 11:04.197
or perhaps you'd like to hear
how I was accused of adultery

11:04.297 --> 11:06.934
and whacked with a rolled-up
manuscript?

11:07.034 --> 11:08.635
What?

11:08.736 --> 11:10.804
I just don't know if I could
go through all this again.

11:10.904 --> 11:12.205
It's so demeaning.

11:12.305 --> 11:16.476
All the grunt work
and all the lying.

11:16.576 --> 11:18.511
I honestly don't know
if I can do this anymore.

11:18.611 --> 11:20.547
Well, you need
the money.

11:20.647 --> 11:22.382
And there's perks
to being 26,

11:22.482 --> 11:25.185
like, having sex
with a hot 26-year-old.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.187
He doesn't even have a door
on his bedroom anymore.

11:27.287 --> 11:29.389
Now all we do
is play video games.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.391
Need some wine?

11:31.491 --> 11:32.392
Thank you.

11:32.492 --> 11:34.061
Want some parmigiano?

11:34.161 --> 11:36.396
- Prosciutto.
- Yes.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.465
And can we put on our sweats
and watch Downton Abbey?

11:38.565 --> 11:40.067
Absolutely.

11:40.167 --> 11:41.902
It'll be like having
a 40-year-old time-out.

11:42.002 --> 11:43.136
Should I break out
the slanket?

11:43.236 --> 11:44.137
I love you.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.438
[cell phone buzzing]

11:45.538 --> 11:47.540
Mm, getting a call?

11:47.640 --> 11:50.477
- Oh, no.
- What?

11:50.577 --> 11:52.379
Hello?

11:52.479 --> 11:54.247
Charles' babysitter didn't show,
so I volunteered you.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.049
Uh, I'm already
back in Brooklyn.

11:56.149 --> 11:58.285
If only there were some sort
of underground train system

11:58.385 --> 12:00.420
that could get you to the upper
West side in 30 minutes,

12:00.520 --> 12:02.322
which is when
he's expecting you.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.657
Is this already
a done deal?

12:04.792 --> 12:06.293
I'm texting you
the address right now.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.895
Leave immediately.

12:07.995 --> 12:09.362
What?

12:09.462 --> 12:10.998
I have to go babysit
my boss' boss' kids.

12:11.098 --> 12:11.999
- Now?
- Yup.

12:12.099 --> 12:13.801
Back to 26.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.936
Oh, you poor thing.
Here, chug that.

12:22.475 --> 12:23.944
(Charles)
Thank you for coming, Liza.

12:24.044 --> 12:25.378
You are really
saving the day.

12:25.478 --> 12:28.081
Oh, well,
it's no problem.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.383
Hi.
I'm Liza.

12:30.483 --> 12:33.353
This is Bianca.
That's Nicole.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.388
Say hi.
Don't be shy.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.893
I used to babysit
a girl who was very shy.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.361
What was her name?

12:41.461 --> 12:42.930
Kaitlyn.

12:43.030 --> 12:44.364
And you know what
Kaitlyn loved?

12:44.464 --> 12:45.365
What?

12:45.465 --> 12:46.599
Polly Pockets.

12:46.699 --> 12:48.535
So do I!

12:48.635 --> 12:50.838
It's too bad we don't have any
here that we could play with.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.405
We do!

12:52.505 --> 12:54.041
I have Polly, Lea,
Chrissy, Lila, and Shani.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.309
- Come to my playroom!
- No, come to my playroom.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.045
What, you have two
playrooms?

12:58.145 --> 12:59.579
And a media room
and a library.

12:59.679 --> 13:01.148
- Wow.
- Come on!

13:01.248 --> 13:03.116
- Have fun.
- You too.

13:03.216 --> 13:04.417
Be good.

13:08.856 --> 13:11.691
It's so difficult being
married to a renowned author.

13:11.859 --> 13:14.862
Women literally throw
themselves at Anton.

13:14.962 --> 13:17.030
They think baiting
a literary giant

13:17.130 --> 13:19.867
will give meaning to their
miserable little lives.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.269
Well, I suppose
some of the--

13:22.369 --> 13:24.872
Those little groupies?
They're disgusting.

13:24.972 --> 13:27.374
And you know the women
I'm talking about, yes?

13:27.474 --> 13:30.043
Yes, yes, yes.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.579
Yes, I do.
Excuse me.

13:35.682 --> 13:37.584
I can't believe
you wrote about our affair

13:37.684 --> 13:39.119
and showed your wife.

13:39.219 --> 13:41.955
It was vague.
Could be anyone your age.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.157
Oh, anyone in publishing

13:44.257 --> 13:47.394
who has doe eyes
and a walrus vagina?

13:47.494 --> 13:49.496
What the hell
does that even mean?

13:49.596 --> 13:51.598
Have you ever touched
a walrus fold?

13:51.698 --> 13:54.167
When would I ever
do that?

13:54.267 --> 13:57.270
Well, then you cannot
understand.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.973
It is the highest
compliment in my country.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.913
Oh, no!
Oh, no!

14:05.979 --> 14:07.314
The zombies are closing in!

14:07.414 --> 14:08.916
What am I gonna do?

14:09.016 --> 14:09.917
Oh, no!
Oh--

14:10.017 --> 14:10.984
[cell phone chimes]

14:11.084 --> 14:12.019
Freeze!

14:14.654 --> 14:16.589
I got to text
the sheriff.

14:27.567 --> 14:28.635
Okay.

14:28.735 --> 14:31.471
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Ow, my brains!

14:31.571 --> 14:34.474
(man)
This year's PEN
social justice award

14:34.574 --> 14:36.743
goes to Alex Minnick.

14:36.843 --> 14:38.745
[applause]

14:38.845 --> 14:41.781
[both speaking in Swedish]

14:57.364 --> 14:58.798
Long line at the bar.

14:58.966 --> 15:00.968
Thought I'd bring you
another scotch just in case.

15:01.034 --> 15:02.169
Well, thank you.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.104
Oh.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.739
So, how are you
holding up?

15:06.839 --> 15:08.575
Oh, you know.

15:08.675 --> 15:09.842
Day by day.

15:09.977 --> 15:11.478
Divorce is tough.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.613
Are you divorced?

15:13.713 --> 15:15.015
Yes, yes.

15:15.115 --> 15:16.516
I was married briefly
in my 20s.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.518
Everyone kept asking,
"What happened?"

15:18.618 --> 15:20.287
Like it's so easy
to explain.

15:20.387 --> 15:22.855
Well, it's, uh,
easy for me to explain.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.591
My wife left me
for another man.

15:24.691 --> 15:26.526
So did my husband.

15:26.626 --> 15:29.329
[cell phone chimes]

15:29.429 --> 15:31.864
It's from Liza.

15:31.999 --> 15:33.100
I asked her to check in
with me.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.601
(Liza)
Oh...

15:34.701 --> 15:36.369
Brains!

15:36.469 --> 15:38.005
Oh, no!

15:38.105 --> 15:40.707
She is just fantastic
with kids.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.042
I love kids too.

15:42.142 --> 15:45.012
Some people
find them annoying,

15:45.112 --> 15:46.679
but I-I just love them.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.481
(man)
Welcome back,
ladies and gentlemen.

15:48.581 --> 15:51.718
Looks like Bjornberg
is up next.

15:51.818 --> 15:53.153
Anton, stop it.

15:53.253 --> 15:55.222
Your wife is right there.

15:55.322 --> 15:56.323
[speaking indistinctly]

15:56.423 --> 15:57.524
It's brilliant.

15:57.624 --> 16:01.128
No, it's--it's terrible.

16:01.228 --> 16:04.031
Listen, this whole thing--

16:04.131 --> 16:06.299
I've loved our time
together, okay,

16:06.399 --> 16:07.900
but it needs to end.

16:08.035 --> 16:09.902
I mean it.

16:10.037 --> 16:11.404
[clears throat]

16:14.407 --> 16:15.675
[gasps]

16:15.775 --> 16:17.110
This is how I feel
when you say that.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.111
What are you doing?

16:18.211 --> 16:19.546
I will not agree to this.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.714
Stop.
God, you're bleeding.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.616
(man)
And this year's PEN
Scandinavian prize

16:23.716 --> 16:26.286
goes to Anton Bjornberg.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.688
I refuse to lose you.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.457
Okay, okay.
You won't have to.

16:30.557 --> 16:31.558
Just go. Go.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.593
[applause]

16:45.672 --> 16:47.074
I don't think
we've officially met.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.176
I'm Kelsey Peters.
I'm Anton's editor.

16:49.276 --> 16:52.179
Oh.
Nice to meet you, Kelsey.

16:52.279 --> 16:54.314
I'm the one sleeping
with your husband.

16:54.414 --> 16:55.582
Excuse me?

16:55.682 --> 16:57.384
It's not Liza.

16:57.484 --> 16:59.419
I am the walrus.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.291
Hello?

17:09.929 --> 17:10.829
Are they asleep?

17:10.930 --> 17:11.830
Oh, yeah.
Hours ago.

17:11.931 --> 17:12.832
How was it?

17:12.932 --> 17:14.267
Everything was great.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.604
Except Kelsey Peters
left rather abruptly.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.406
Yeah, she texted me.
She was sick.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.242
How did everything
go here?

17:22.342 --> 17:23.510
Oh, it was great.

17:23.609 --> 17:25.978
You didn't do
the windows, did you?

17:26.113 --> 17:29.449
Uh, no, that's
"monster go away" spray.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.251
[laughs]

17:31.351 --> 17:32.785
Can I
offer you a drink?

17:32.885 --> 17:35.788
Sure. I'll have
what you're having.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.624
Uh--

17:37.724 --> 17:41.161
Okay.
Thank you.

17:41.261 --> 17:43.330
The girls--they were
just angels tonight.

17:43.430 --> 17:44.931
I am glad to hear that.

17:45.031 --> 17:46.266
Please.

17:46.366 --> 17:48.768
This divorce has been
rough on them,

17:48.868 --> 17:50.903
and they can act out.

17:51.003 --> 17:52.672
Well, you must be doing
something right.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.674
I don't know,
their mother's in California,

17:54.774 --> 17:57.043
and the girls haven't
seen her for months.

17:57.144 --> 17:59.212
Yeah, Nicole told me.
It's rough.

17:59.312 --> 18:01.914
Yeah, it's a mess.

18:02.014 --> 18:03.650
Mm, it's okay.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.018
Messes make people
interesting.

18:06.153 --> 18:08.321
They do?

18:08.421 --> 18:10.590
Yes.
The messier, the better.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.825
Name any great artist.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.162
Uh, Beethoven.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.029
Alcoholic father.

18:17.164 --> 18:19.065
Kurt Vonnegut.

18:20.967 --> 18:22.702
Searching.
Okay, keep going.

18:22.802 --> 18:23.836
Jonathan Franzen.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.805
Oh, messy divorce.

18:25.905 --> 18:26.806
Woody Allen.

18:26.906 --> 18:28.175
[scoffs]
Please.

18:28.241 --> 18:29.709
[laughs]

18:29.809 --> 18:33.180
Vonnegut--
mom committed suicide. Boom.

18:33.246 --> 18:36.849
So now we're taking pleasure
in other peoples' misery?

18:36.949 --> 18:39.186
No, we're taking solace
in other peoples' misery,

18:39.286 --> 18:43.456
and we should do it frequently
in order to maintain our sanity.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.458
You sure you're 26?

18:45.558 --> 18:47.660
[laughs]

18:47.760 --> 18:49.095
[cell phone chimes]

18:52.665 --> 18:54.567
Oh, a friend's
walking me home.

18:54.667 --> 18:57.670
Oh, I was gonna call you a car,
but that's good.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.872
So I'll--I'll see you
at the office?

18:59.972 --> 19:00.973
Yeah.

19:01.208 --> 19:03.476
Maybe you can
babysit again.

19:03.576 --> 19:07.380
Yeah, just let me know.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.981
Yeah, you don't want me
to keep you here

19:09.081 --> 19:10.983
when you have
a young man waiting.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.520
Well, how do you know
it's a young man?

19:15.755 --> 19:17.257
Isn't it?

19:19.226 --> 19:22.128
Uh, yeah, it is.

19:25.565 --> 19:27.600
Okay. Sorry.
Good night.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.602
Good night.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.073
Wait.

19:34.241 --> 19:36.643
I, uh,

19:36.743 --> 19:39.246
forgot to, uh, pay you.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.817
Thank you.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.553
Thank you.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.355
I'll see you at work.

19:48.455 --> 19:50.257
You got it.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.393
Good night.

20:01.634 --> 20:03.403
You didn't have
to come get me.

20:03.503 --> 20:05.338
Hi.

20:05.438 --> 20:09.842
But then I would've had to wait
so long to give you this.

20:09.942 --> 20:10.843
What?

20:10.943 --> 20:11.844
What?

20:11.944 --> 20:13.179
Come on.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.881
You said you were
badass, right?

20:14.981 --> 20:16.516
Yeah, when I was 17.

20:16.616 --> 20:17.950
Well, that wasn't
that long ago.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.919
Uh, yeah, it is.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.288
Come on.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.723
Let's give it a go.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.725
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

20:25.825 --> 20:28.295
- Ready?
- Yes.

20:28.395 --> 20:30.463
Okay.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.499
Whoo-hoo!

20:35.468 --> 20:37.069
[laughs]

20:37.169 --> 20:38.338
Oh, snap.
