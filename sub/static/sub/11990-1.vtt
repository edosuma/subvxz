03:01.922 --> 03:05.857
   Did you ever wonder about
   the moment you became you?

03:05.859 --> 03:09.260
       I've been thinking
       about that lately.

     decides how we forever

   incredible spectacles and

06:40.094 --> 06:42.427

   could buy and own and have

          as possible.

         I'm so sorry.

39:25.974 --> 39:28.474
     It's okay, it's okay.
           It's okay.

39:28.476 --> 39:30.509
          -I'm sorry.
          -It's okay.

39:31.545 --> 39:35.480
     Hey listen, I've been
   thinking about something.

39:35.482 --> 39:38.883
    Um, I was thinking about
     what you said earlier

39:38.885 --> 39:43.754
       about leaving your
   parents and you're right.

39:43.756 --> 39:46.056
        You stood up for
      me, you know, you...

39:46.058 --> 39:48.558
     You took a chance that
    I would be the guy that

39:48.560 --> 39:50.626
        you'd hope for.

39:50.628 --> 39:53.428
        Isn't that what
       people in love do?

39:53.430 --> 39:54.762
             Yeah.

39:54.764 --> 39:57.297
   Yeah, but what they don't
   do, or what they shouldn't

39:57.299 --> 40:00.600
   do is ask the people they
     love to give up other

40:00.602 --> 40:01.601
     people that they love.

40:01.603 --> 40:02.835
          No, that...

40:02.837 --> 40:04.536
    It didn't have anything
        to do with you.

40:04.538 --> 40:05.837
      That was my choice.

40:05.839 --> 40:09.540
    But I let it happen so I
  feel like it was our choice.

40:09.542 --> 40:11.642
     And it was a mistake.

40:11.644 --> 40:13.977
     Look, I know that it's
       very hard to trust

40:13.979 --> 40:17.814
   anything I say right now,
   but since I feel like you

40:17.816 --> 40:23.019
   have a little bit of pity
 for me, can I ask you a favor?

40:23.021 --> 40:25.788
   Well, you can always ask.

40:27.659 --> 40:31.127
         I want you to
       call your parents.

40:31.129 --> 40:32.561
              No.

40:32.563 --> 40:33.562
              Why?

40:33.564 --> 40:34.996
           Listen...

40:34.998 --> 40:38.132
     After my mother died,
   there hasn't been a single

40:38.134 --> 40:40.434
   day that's gone by that I
   don't think about what it

40:40.436 --> 40:44.704
  would've been like to share
 every single moment with her.

40:44.706 --> 40:46.739
     The good and the bad.

40:46.741 --> 40:48.874
     And it's just too much
   burden for me to feel like

40:48.876 --> 40:51.176
    I am the reason that you
   don't talk to your parents

40:51.178 --> 40:53.178
    and god forbid something
     should happen to them.

40:53.180 --> 40:54.045
             Kevin.

40:54.047 --> 40:55.112
              No.

40:55.114 --> 40:56.646
     Not after the way they
        treated you. No.

40:56.648 --> 40:58.748
    Look, they never treated
        me badly, Gayle.

40:58.750 --> 41:01.751
      Being careful about
     bringing somebody into

41:01.753 --> 41:03.085
          your family,
       that's admirable.

41:03.087 --> 41:04.586
     That's not judgmental.

41:04.588 --> 41:06.588
        And look at me.

41:06.590 --> 41:08.823
    I mean, they were right
   to be worried about their

41:08.825 --> 41:09.857
       daughter's future.

41:09.859 --> 41:11.892
         I don't blame
         them for that.

41:12.661 --> 41:14.093
           I just...

41:15.529 --> 41:17.595
   I know that they love you.

41:17.597 --> 41:20.064
     I know that they want
       the best for you.

41:20.066 --> 41:23.167
      And I just want you
       to think about it.

41:23.169 --> 41:27.004
     I'm just being selfish
   because I'm thinking maybe

41:27.006 --> 41:28.638
         we can move in
       with your parents.

41:28.640 --> 41:31.841
 It's better than living in my
  grandma's closet in Newark.

41:31.843 --> 41:33.509
            [laughs]

41:39.550 --> 41:41.516
     I will think about it.

41:41.518 --> 41:42.750
           Thank you.

41:44.720 --> 41:46.486
      How was it tonight?

41:46.488 --> 41:47.587
          Pretty tame.

41:47.589 --> 41:49.655
         Made some good
          tips though.

41:49.657 --> 41:51.123
      How are you feeling?

41:51.125 --> 41:52.757
          Super tired.

41:52.759 --> 41:57.895
    I slept the whole day so
   now I can't really sleep.

41:57.897 --> 41:59.129
     What are you watching?

41:59.131 --> 42:01.097
     Just channel surfing.

42:01.099 --> 42:03.165
       Still pretty wound
         up from today.

42:03.167 --> 42:04.599
      What are you eating?

42:04.601 --> 42:05.900
       Chocolate brownie.

42:05.902 --> 42:07.534
          Your faves.

42:07.536 --> 42:09.669
 I'm kinda tight with the sous
  chef so he made me a batch.

42:09.671 --> 42:11.771
     Speaking of which, I'm
      gonna send you some.

42:11.773 --> 42:12.738
            Thanks.

42:12.740 --> 42:14.239
              Hey.

42:14.241 --> 42:16.174
       Don't worry, okay?

42:16.176 --> 42:18.142
        Someone's gonna
          be a match.

42:18.777 --> 42:21.043
    You know what I'd like?

42:21.045 --> 42:23.211
    I'd like to know what it
    feels like to have a man

42:23.213 --> 42:25.112
      be in love with me.

42:26.181 --> 42:28.214
    I mean, really love me.

42:28.216 --> 42:34.053
  Not some idea of me or how I
  make him feel about himself.

42:34.055 --> 42:35.587
              Me.

42:37.624 --> 42:40.524
        What if I don't
       get to feel that?

42:40.526 --> 42:42.125
    I think some people live
     really long lives that

42:42.127 --> 42:44.560
    never get to feel that.

42:45.529 --> 42:48.096
        I'm scared, too.

42:48.098 --> 42:50.698
   You know why I called you?

42:50.700 --> 42:53.701
         I mean, after
         all this time.

42:53.703 --> 42:56.670
       To save me from a
    lifetime of debauchery?

42:56.672 --> 42:58.004
            [laughs]

42:58.006 --> 43:03.142
   Um, I guess because we've
   been best friends forever.

43:03.144 --> 43:06.812
 You're the last person that I
   know that really loved me.

43:06.814 --> 43:09.848
   My mom said that once when
     she came up to campus.

43:10.951 --> 43:14.686
 You remember that weird modern
 dance recital that we were in?

43:15.655 --> 43:18.922
    She said afterwards that
   she thought that we seemed

43:18.924 --> 43:20.756
         like sisters.

43:24.261 --> 43:26.027
     You know that place I
    was telling you about in

43:26.029 --> 43:29.330
   Chinatown is getting a new
  shipment in from Hong Kong.

43:29.332 --> 43:31.732
   I was thinking about using
    some of my tip money and

43:31.734 --> 43:34.634
     going to buy some new
      brocade and boucle.

43:34.636 --> 43:36.969
     Only you can get that
     excited about fabrics.

43:36.971 --> 43:38.136
            [scoffs]

43:38.138 --> 43:39.971
    Okay, I mean I was gonna
      make you something,

43:39.973 --> 43:41.272
      but if you're gonna
        go and talk some

43:41.274 --> 43:44.074
       trash then you're
          on your own.

43:52.784 --> 43:54.216
             Sorry.

43:54.218 --> 43:55.817
          Come on in.

44:01.057 --> 44:02.623
          Take a seat.

44:04.827 --> 44:08.261
    Uh, so uh, I just wanted
       to say thanks, uh,

44:08.263 --> 44:11.063
       in person for what
      you've done for me.

44:11.065 --> 44:15.333
   Uh, I know what I do with
   music, but those pictures,

44:15.335 --> 44:17.835
     you really, you really
      captured something.

44:17.837 --> 44:19.636
     Well, thanks. Thanks.

44:19.638 --> 44:21.304
    I mean, you were the one
    that inspired it all so

44:21.306 --> 44:23.773
        really were just
         a great team.

44:23.775 --> 44:25.674
     I want you on my tour.

44:25.676 --> 44:27.175
          Six months.

44:27.911 --> 44:29.377
              Wow.

44:29.379 --> 44:30.845
        That's amazing.

44:30.847 --> 44:33.097
             Um...

44:33.098 --> 44:35.348
  Yeah, it would be amazing to
   have that kind of time to,

44:35.351 --> 44:38.185
         you know like,
       tell a real story.

44:38.187 --> 44:40.854
    Yeah, something amazing.

44:40.856 --> 44:43.022
           So, yeah?

44:43.024 --> 44:47.959
   Yeah, I just have to check
     the dates and clear my

44:47.961 --> 44:50.661
        schedule and...

44:50.663 --> 44:51.328
             Yeah.

44:51.330 --> 44:52.295
            Alright.

44:52.297 --> 44:53.796
             Cool.

44:53.798 --> 44:54.997
            Amazing.

45:00.904 --> 45:02.370
              Hey.

45:02.372 --> 45:04.205
    Don't tell me you stole
       Beth's car again.

45:04.207 --> 45:06.173
       I don't think I'd
      try that one again.

45:06.175 --> 45:08.341
      I took the train and
      she knows I'm here.

45:10.411 --> 45:12.677
    Mom gave me this letter
        for you to read.

45:12.912 --> 45:15.812
       It's uh, grandma's
            writing.

45:17.916 --> 45:21.050
    Your name's on it, too.
     Why don't you read it?

45:33.396 --> 45:37.331
        Um, you sure you
        wanna hear this?

45:39.201 --> 45:41.067
              No.

45:46.173 --> 45:47.805
       To my bony Becca,

45:47.807 --> 45:50.107
 My beloved girl who bewitched
     me the moment her eyes

45:50.109 --> 45:51.842
        flashed at mine.

45:51.844 --> 45:53.410
    By now you have learned
   the truth and no doubt you

45:53.412 --> 45:56.179
   are angry at me, and Beth,
   and Peter for robbing you

45:56.181 --> 45:59.315
       the reality of the
  circumstances of your birth.

45:59.317 --> 46:02.051
   You are no longer a girl,
     but a grown person of

46:02.053 --> 46:03.819
     great mind and heart.

46:03.821 --> 46:06.454
    I ask you to reach deep
    inside yourself and ask,

46:06.456 --> 46:08.889
   what should've been done?

46:08.891 --> 46:11.691
   A girl was not ready to be
   a mother and a woman who's

46:11.693 --> 46:13.726
        not yet finished
           being one.

46:13.728 --> 46:16.995
     It wasn't ideal, but I
   knew how to keep you whole

46:16.997 --> 46:18.963
    so you could grow up to
   have all the strength you

46:18.965 --> 46:21.065
   needed to understand that
   your life was filled with

46:21.067 --> 46:24.934
         true love, not
          true labels.

46:26.737 --> 46:31.005
   I loved being your mother,
    grandmother, and friend.

46:31.440 --> 46:36.309
   And to my Tony, you might
 just be old enough to realize

46:36.311 --> 46:38.911
       how lucky you are
       to have a sister.

46:39.947 --> 46:42.180
   I hope you will be closer
    to her than anyone else

46:42.182 --> 46:44.749
        because you two
        need each other.

46:47.019 --> 46:49.185
     You must both forgive
        Beth and Peter.

46:49.187 --> 46:50.920
     For they have been the
    ones carrying this heavy

46:50.922 --> 46:52.888
    burden these many years.

46:52.890 --> 46:56.892
Only you have the power to lift
  the weight off their hearts.

46:56.894 --> 47:01.930
    Set them free, my loves,
   and you will be free, too.

47:01.932 --> 47:06.100
        Free to love any
        chance you get.

47:12.942 --> 47:14.341
          What's this?

47:16.745 --> 47:20.480
    Dear Becca, Tony Irving,

47:20.482 --> 47:24.450
 Your grandmother, Alice Zelda
  Irving, has left her estate

47:24.452 --> 47:29.488
   in the sum of $2.3 million
 dollars to her grandchildren,

47:29.490 --> 47:31.790
    Rebecca and Tony Irving.

47:32.526 --> 47:34.759
           Holy crap.

47:43.002 --> 47:44.401
         Oh, Miss Gray.

47:46.872 --> 47:47.971
       How are you today?

47:47.973 --> 47:51.507
   Hi, Doctor Conrad, I'm...

47:52.943 --> 47:55.510
      Well, I see you were
  referred by your internist,

47:55.512 --> 47:57.478
        Doctor Hamilton.

47:57.480 --> 48:01.215
   And my notes say here that
   you're here for a D and C.

48:02.051 --> 48:04.951
    Dilation and curettage.

48:05.320 --> 48:07.253
   Termination of pregnancy.

48:07.255 --> 48:08.020
              Oh!

48:08.022 --> 48:08.887
              Yes.

48:08.889 --> 48:10.288
       Yes, that's right.

48:10.290 --> 48:13.257
    But your nurse said you
    wanted to see me first?

48:13.259 --> 48:15.559
     Well, yes. We take the
    termination of pregnancy

48:15.561 --> 48:17.827
        very seriously.

48:18.996 --> 48:23.065
 Right. Well, I can assure you,
 doctor, that I take everything

48:23.067 --> 48:26.268
       to do with my body
       very seriously and

48:26.270 --> 48:28.903
      I've done extensive
    research on this subject

48:28.905 --> 48:33.908
    and, you know, I'm quite
    prepared for the medical

48:33.910 --> 48:38.913
      risks and as for the
     mental complications,

48:38.915 --> 48:44.151
  it's not like some pubescent
    teenage girl with raging

48:44.153 --> 48:47.454
   hormones that's surprised
       by her condition.

48:47.456 --> 48:53.025
    You know, and unaware of
    the choice she's making.

48:53.027 --> 48:56.461
 For the record, your hormones
     are, in fact, raging.

48:56.463 --> 48:58.596
   And your primary physician
     has noted her that you

48:58.598 --> 49:01.065

        It is not fair.

57:17.988 --> 57:18.987
      Whatever I've done.

57:18.989 --> 57:21.589
         I didn't raise
       you to be a bully.

57:21.591 --> 57:23.057
   God, what is your problem?

57:23.059 --> 57:23.957
      What is my problem?

57:23.959 --> 57:25.692
         Seriously, you
          ask me that?

57:25.694 --> 57:28.895
   Don't you realize, life is
   short and I love you and I

57:28.897 --> 57:32.632
       have not seen you
         for two years.

57:32.634 --> 57:35.501
    And that's all my fault.

57:37.738 --> 57:40.504
          No, probably
        it is my fault.

57:45.744 --> 57:48.228
          You know...

57:48.229 --> 57:50.713
    When you were born and I
     saw you, I didn't know

57:50.715 --> 57:53.582
     that I could ever need
   anything that badly, that

57:53.584 --> 57:56.451
       I could ever love
      anything that much.

57:56.453 --> 57:57.819
            Just...

57:57.821 --> 58:00.521
     -My life just stopped.
             -Mom.

58:00.523 --> 58:03.056
    I mean, when I held you
     for the first time, I

58:03.058 --> 58:05.825
   didn't know if it was for
   five minutes or five hours

58:05.827 --> 58:06.859
         or five weeks.

58:06.861 --> 58:08.827
   I mean, time just stopped.

58:08.829 --> 58:10.228
             -Mom.
        -In a good way.

58:10.230 --> 58:11.963
         In a good way.

58:12.699 --> 58:16.634
        And I know I was
         overbearing...

58:16.636 --> 58:18.035
            No, mom.

58:18.037 --> 58:21.738
   Yeah. I mean, it was just,
 you were so perfect and I was

58:21.740 --> 58:24.240
       so proud of myself
        for making you.

58:24.242 --> 58:26.742
    You weren't overbearing.

58:26.744 --> 58:29.878
    There was just so much--

58:29.880 --> 58:31.079
           Pressure?

58:31.081 --> 58:32.480
           Attention.

58:32.482 --> 58:38.818
   And it was just relentless
       and overwhelming.

58:38.820 --> 58:40.920
          I just never
         felt worth it.

58:40.922 --> 58:42.588
          Oh, sweetie.

58:42.590 --> 58:45.824
My ninth birthday, I don't know
 if you remember that party...

58:45.826 --> 58:49.027
    There were sixteen kids
     and Mr. Marquee on the

58:49.029 --> 58:51.095
     front lawn, two peanut
     allergies, and I think

58:51.097 --> 58:52.863
   there was some conjurer...

58:52.865 --> 58:56.766
     Right, uh well, when I
     blew out my candles...

58:56.768 --> 58:59.535
         Two red, three
       blue, four white.

58:59.537 --> 59:00.869
        Okay, rain man.

59:00.871 --> 59:03.204
           When I...

59:03.206 --> 59:08.609
        When I blew out
         my candles...

59:08.611 --> 59:14.648
      I wished to be good.

59:14.650 --> 59:18.218
    And I know that my grown
     up brain now says good

59:18.220 --> 59:23.122
       enough, but I will
       never forget that.

59:23.124 --> 59:28.894
   You know, I wanna be good.

59:28.896 --> 59:31.096
    And it never came true.

59:31.098 --> 59:32.831
         But you were.

59:32.833 --> 59:35.600
         You were over
        and over for me.

59:35.602 --> 59:38.169
          I mean, you
        were my miracle.

59:38.171 --> 59:41.705
   You were my miracle and if
    miracles are good, then

59:41.707 --> 59:42.839
         you were good.

59:42.841 --> 59:44.874
         You were good.

59:46.244 --> 59:50.745
     How much do you need?

59:52.115 --> 59:54.181
            32,000.

59:54.917 --> 59:55.916
          Wow, really?

59:55.918 --> 59:57.617
      For cakes? That's...

59:57.619 --> 01:00:00.152
         What are they,
     designer ingredients?

01:00:00.154 --> 01:00:01.887
      You know, it's uh...

01:00:01.889 --> 01:00:04.856
      storefront, delivery
   truck, mixers, and ovens.

01:00:04.858 --> 01:00:07.792
     It actually is a very
    thorough business plan.

01:00:07.794 --> 01:00:09.226
          Yeah, yeah.

01:00:09.228 --> 01:00:10.994
             Um...

01:00:11.963 --> 01:00:13.295
     And this is really...

01:00:13.297 --> 01:00:16.031
   This is what you wanna do?

01:00:17.034 --> 01:00:18.233
             Sure.

01:00:18.235 --> 01:00:19.634
              No.

01:00:19.636 --> 01:00:21.936
         Of course not.

01:00:21.938 --> 01:00:24.605
          I want to go
        back to college.

01:00:24.607 --> 01:00:26.907
        I want to teach
          art history.

01:00:26.909 --> 01:00:28.842
        Well, then let's
         do that then.

01:00:28.844 --> 01:00:29.742
         Let's do that.

01:00:29.744 --> 01:00:30.943
          It's easier
        said than done.

01:00:30.945 --> 01:00:33.745
    No, I bet you could get
     enrolled in the fall.

01:00:33.747 --> 01:00:37.782
   It's not about logistics.

01:00:37.784 --> 01:00:42.987
    It's more a question of
     childcare facilities.

01:00:44.357 --> 01:00:47.224
       Oh my god, really?

01:00:47.226 --> 01:00:50.026
          Oh, sweetie,
       that's wonderful!

01:00:50.028 --> 01:00:51.227
       You're not a touch
         disappointed.

01:00:51.229 --> 01:00:52.962
        No, why would I
        be disappointed?

01:00:52.964 --> 01:00:57.866
   Oh, I don't know because I
   never exactly accomplished

01:00:57.868 --> 01:01:00.168
     anything spectacular.

01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:02.203
      Producing a daughter
        is spectacular.

01:01:02.205 --> 01:01:04.271
     Well we don't know yet
       if it's a boy or--

01:01:04.273 --> 01:01:06.640
          It's a girl,
          it's a girl.

01:01:06.642 --> 01:01:11.044
 -Oh, you know that for a fact.
 -I do, I would bet a designer
   cake business on it, yes.

01:01:11.046 --> 01:01:12.979
     Why do you think that?
           Seriously.

01:01:12.981 --> 01:01:14.380
       Have you met your
          grandmother?

01:01:14.382 --> 01:01:15.781
           Uh, yeah.

01:01:15.783 --> 01:01:17.249
    Is she not the sweetest
     woman in the universe?

01:01:17.251 --> 01:01:19.117
         Absolutely, no
       argument from me.

01:01:19.119 --> 01:01:22.220
     Well, I made her life
      miserable for years.

01:01:22.222 --> 01:01:23.955
            -Really?
           -Yup, yup.

01:01:23.957 --> 01:01:25.389
    -She never told me that.
              -No.

01:01:25.391 --> 01:01:26.957
            [laughs]

01:01:26.959 --> 01:01:28.124
        That is actually
         really funny.

01:01:28.126 --> 01:01:31.827
    I needed to have you to
      teach me how to be a

01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:34.395
     daughter to my mother.

01:01:36.132 --> 01:01:37.364
            Oh, god.

01:01:37.366 --> 01:01:39.232
     It's definitely going
    to be a girl, isn't it?

01:01:39.234 --> 01:01:40.399
            [laughs]

01:01:40.401 --> 01:01:43.702
      And she is going to
    torture me, but I guess

01:01:43.704 --> 01:01:45.804
       it's no more than
       I deserve, right?

01:01:45.806 --> 01:01:48.273
          It's no more
       than you deserve.

01:01:48.275 --> 01:01:50.308
         Hey, I'm home.

01:01:50.310 --> 01:01:52.009
    Who are you talking to?

01:01:52.011 --> 01:01:54.644

         Excuse me, is

       Of course, Rigby.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.032
           You mind?

01:02:20.034 --> 01:02:20.932
              No.

01:02:20.934 --> 01:02:21.866
       Hi, Doctor Conrad.

01:02:21.868 --> 01:02:23.200
    What are you doing here?

01:02:23.202 --> 01:02:24.401
            Eating.

01:02:25.303 --> 01:02:27.169
             Right.

01:02:27.171 --> 01:02:30.071
   Why are patients always so
    surprised when they see

01:02:30.073 --> 01:02:32.206
        their doctors in
        the real world?

       grocery shopping.

    You know, we don't wanna
  see our super heroes forced

     to endure the mundane.

01:02:42.918 --> 01:02:44.250
              Mm.

01:02:45.886 --> 01:02:49.420
   I'm really sorry about the

         Eh, it's fine.

01:02:56.393 --> 01:02:57.792
        How's the pasta?

01:02:57.794 --> 01:02:59.360
       It's really good.

01:02:59.362 --> 01:03:00.194
              -Hi.
            -Oh, hi.

      What can I get you?

     Hm, a glass of Chianti
   and uh, seafood marinara.

01:03:06.901 --> 01:03:08.033
            Thanks.

01:03:11.038 --> 01:03:14.806
    Rigby, such a cool name.

   It's my mom's maiden name.

01:03:18.411 --> 01:03:21.378
   Her dad never had any boys
     so you know the story.

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:22.779
              Hm.

01:03:22.781 --> 01:03:25.982
     Oh, I'm sorry, did you
     want a glass of wine.

01:03:25.984 --> 01:03:28.451
        Um, I thought I
      wasn't supposed to.

01:03:28.453 --> 01:03:30.352
       Oh, I thought you
      were going to um...

01:03:30.354 --> 01:03:32.287
         No, I am, yes.

01:03:32.289 --> 01:03:34.188
     I am still, I just...

01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:36.857
         I just thought
       maybe I shouldn't.

01:03:36.859 --> 01:03:39.226
     Probably a good idea.

01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:43.062
        Can I ask you a
       personal question?

01:03:43.064 --> 01:03:44.863
              Hm.

01:03:44.865 --> 01:03:47.265
    Does your wife ever mind
     you working so closely

01:03:47.267 --> 01:03:49.200
       with other women?

01:03:50.836 --> 01:03:54.137
       I look at the body
    clinically for a living.

01:03:54.139 --> 01:03:58.441
  I mean, lips can be used for
  talking as well as kissing.

01:03:58.443 --> 01:04:02.511
     The hands for working
      as well as touching.

01:04:02.513 --> 01:04:07.214
  The female organs for giving
  birth as well as conceiving.

01:04:09.117 --> 01:04:13.853
       I mean, the whole
      body can be sexual.

01:04:13.855 --> 01:04:16.355
         It's all about
          the context.

01:04:17.324 --> 01:04:20.091
    I don't think I'd be too
    happy if my husband did

01:04:20.093 --> 01:04:22.293
     what you do for a job.

01:04:22.295 --> 01:04:23.994
              Hm.

01:04:23.996 --> 01:04:26.396
        I didn't realize
       you were married.

01:04:26.398 --> 01:04:27.930
         -No, I'm not.
             -Yeah?

01:04:27.932 --> 01:04:29.398
        I'm just saying,
           if I were.

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:30.499
              Oh.

01:04:30.501 --> 01:04:33.335
        Did you deliver
         your own kids?

01:04:33.337 --> 01:04:35.270
             I did.

01:04:35.272 --> 01:04:37.338
        I don't think I
         could do that.

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:42.109
     If my husband were my
      doctor, I'd have to

01:04:42.111 --> 01:04:45.345
       keep some mystery.

01:04:51.352 --> 01:04:53.051
         I'm that way.

01:04:53.953 --> 01:04:55.886
         I'm this way.

01:04:58.090 --> 01:04:59.489
    It was nice seeing you.

01:04:59.491 --> 01:05:00.990
           You, too.

01:05:03.294 --> 01:05:04.359
