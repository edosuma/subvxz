00:47.845 --> 00:52.045
<i>- Â™ª Baby, daddy! Baby, daddy! Â™ª</i>
- Yeah?

00:52.125 --> 00:53.925
- Daddy!
- What was your question?

00:54.045 --> 00:55.125
You can ask Hao.

00:55.605 --> 00:59.925
- What are you gonna name your baby?
- <i>Clayton.</i>

01:00.125 --> 01:01.485
- Oh...
- Oh!

01:02.125 --> 01:03.885
Whose baby is in Mommy's tummy?

01:04.765 --> 01:08.805
- Uh, Kelly.
- Whose baby is it? Is it our baby?

01:08.925 --> 01:10.085
- No.
- No.

01:10.165 --> 01:12.525
Where's the baby gonna go after he's born?

01:12.605 --> 01:13.965
Um, I don't know.

01:14.045 --> 01:16.205
- You don't remember?
- No.

01:16.285 --> 01:18.365
- Goodbye.
- Daddy, where are you going?

01:18.445 --> 01:20.165
<i>I'm the person behind the camera.</i>

01:20.725 --> 01:23.645
<i>And this wonderful woman</i>
<i>is pregnant with my baby.</i>

01:25.045 --> 01:26.645
<i>But this is not my family.</i>

01:30.445 --> 01:33.205
<i>I grew up in Chengdu,</i>
<i>in Southwest China,</i>

01:33.485 --> 01:35.805
<i>where my mother's side</i>
<i>of the family lives.</i>

01:38.005 --> 01:40.845
<i>In most aspects, my family's average,</i>

01:41.005 --> 01:44.885
<i>indistinguishable from the city's</i>
<i>other 14 million residents.</i>

01:45.965 --> 01:47.965
So true! Even for us first cousins,

01:48.045 --> 01:50.525
if we bump into each other,
we won't recognize each other.

01:55.405 --> 01:57.965
Luckily I survived the Great Famine.

01:58.365 --> 02:00.885
I would've died
if I'd stayed in the village.

02:00.965 --> 02:02.965
So many died in the countryside.

02:03.525 --> 02:06.205
<i>Here's my mom,</i>
<i>at my grandpa's birthday party.</i>

02:07.725 --> 02:09.645
Back then, I was stupid.

02:09.725 --> 02:13.005
I didn't test into college
because I didn't study hard.

02:13.285 --> 02:17.765
So I focused on educating
my son and daugher from a young age.

02:18.045 --> 02:20.325
They had to do better academically.

02:21.045 --> 02:22.485
<i>And this is my dad.</i>

02:23.045 --> 02:26.525
In my family,
I was the only one who went to college.

02:26.885 --> 02:30.245
The two of you went
to even better schools.

02:30.525 --> 02:34.925
I feel my life
hasn't been a complete waste.

02:35.885 --> 02:37.405
I didn't...

02:38.205 --> 02:39.725
let my ancestors down.

02:40.605 --> 02:43.125
<i>And this my grandpa with my step-grandma.</i>

02:45.285 --> 02:47.325
<i>My grandpa, with his three daughters.</i>

02:49.685 --> 02:52.725
<i>And many other relatives</i>
<i>whose relation to me</i>

02:52.805 --> 02:54.405
<i>I no longer remember.</i>

02:55.085 --> 02:59.725
Hurry and come over.
Damn, stop acting coy.

03:00.285 --> 03:03.685
Grandpa, we wish you good health...

03:04.045 --> 03:06.765
<i>And this is me</i>
<i>and my sister in the family video.</i>

03:08.485 --> 03:10.405
You were always a model good boy.

03:10.805 --> 03:13.165
As the only boy in the clan,

03:13.245 --> 03:16.805
you were expected
to have children and get a good job.

03:17.165 --> 03:18.605
So I can continue to...

03:18.685 --> 03:21.125
- Make the ancestors proud.
- ...make the ancestors proud.

03:21.205 --> 03:22.045
Yes.

03:24.005 --> 03:26.525
<i>Having moved to the US 20 years ago,</i>

03:26.645 --> 03:30.485
<i>for a long time, I rarely</i>
<i>went back to China to visit my family.</i>

03:31.205 --> 03:33.205
Happy birthday to you.

03:33.885 --> 03:36.445
<i>For my grandpa's big 90th birthday,</i>

03:36.645 --> 03:38.325
<i>I felt obligated to return.</i>

03:40.405 --> 03:43.765
<i>Mostly, I hid</i>
<i>behind the camera to avoid any attention.</i>

03:44.725 --> 03:49.005
<i>But my grandpa's biggest concern</i>
<i>was about me, his only grandson.</i>

03:49.205 --> 03:51.485
See you all in another ten years.

03:52.325 --> 03:54.325
Yes, at your 100th birthday.

03:57.485 --> 04:00.205
You all have to come back
for my 100th birthday.

04:00.485 --> 04:02.045
- Of course.
- Absolutely.

04:02.125 --> 04:06.885
You must bring back a wife
for my birthday.

04:07.165 --> 04:09.525
Not a girlfriend. A wife.

04:09.845 --> 04:12.365
A grandkid would be even better.

04:12.605 --> 04:14.125
No need to be cute?

04:14.205 --> 04:16.485
Doesn't matter.
As long as they're your own.

04:17.125 --> 04:18.644
Not adopted.

04:20.685 --> 04:22.525
You already have two great grandkids.

04:23.085 --> 04:26.245
They are your sister's.
I want to see yours.

04:28.045 --> 04:30.285
So, I asked your mom
why she's not worried.

04:30.365 --> 04:33.645
I said, "Tell your son to come back
to get on those dating shows,

04:33.725 --> 04:36.005
such as <i>Saturday Rendezvous."</i>

04:36.445 --> 04:40.445
There's so many new shows now,
<i>- China Style.</i>

04:41.045 --> 04:46.005
In that show, there are so many girls
with both beauty and talent.

04:48.325 --> 04:51.325
<i>I don't remember anyone</i>
<i>ever having to worry about me</i>

04:51.405 --> 04:52.365
<i>when I was little.</i>

04:53.325 --> 04:56.085
<i>My parents worked for</i>
<i>a State-owned car company</i>

04:56.325 --> 04:59.565
<i>so I do remember</i>
<i>lots of chimneys and gray skies.</i>

05:01.165 --> 05:04.805
<i>I also remember my parents</i>
<i>constantly telling me to be obedient</i>

05:05.125 --> 05:06.805
<i>and to excel at school,</i>

05:06.885 --> 05:10.245
<i>which I did.</i>
<i>And that made them very, very proud.</i>

05:12.765 --> 05:14.845
<i>But that was a long, long time ago.</i>

05:19.245 --> 05:22.445
Get out of my way.
Why are you filming this mess?

05:23.205 --> 05:25.885
Enough, enough! So annoying!

05:29.605 --> 05:31.925
I'll never allow you
to come home again!

05:32.005 --> 05:34.045
You say that every time.

05:35.045 --> 05:38.445
Neither of you picks up after yourself
or goes to bed on time.

05:40.525 --> 05:44.965
We sleep at normal hours.
It's you who always stays up late.

05:46.565 --> 05:48.845
I have to wait for you to go to bed first,

05:48.925 --> 05:51.085
so I can bleach
your white laundry at night!

05:51.565 --> 05:53.445
I think for your mom...

05:53.925 --> 05:55.765
her family is her focus.

05:56.045 --> 05:59.165
Her hobby is to make her family

05:59.405 --> 06:02.205
ever cleaner and more perfect.

06:02.285 --> 06:05.485
As soon as you get up,
you yell and I wake up.

06:08.325 --> 06:10.565
If I don't yell to wake up your dad,

06:10.645 --> 06:12.925
no one in this family would get up!

06:13.325 --> 06:16.085
Who'd do the work? Your dad--

06:16.165 --> 06:18.405
- I don't do any work.
- I have to wake him up every day.

06:18.485 --> 06:21.125
Your mom says
the only thing I do is mop the floor.

06:21.205 --> 06:23.245
Get to it. Get it done already!

06:25.565 --> 06:29.365
I don't have energy like before.

06:29.765 --> 06:31.485
I feel very tired every day.

06:31.805 --> 06:34.765
- You will all tire me to death!
- Mom is the spine of this family.

06:37.165 --> 06:38.765
Mom loves to nag.

06:39.245 --> 06:43.045
She has tamed Dad into a "good" dad.

06:44.085 --> 06:46.925
So she wants to use the same method

06:47.005 --> 06:51.085
to tame us into model "good" kids.

06:51.165 --> 06:54.245
I want comfort, too!
If you made a lot of money...

06:54.325 --> 06:56.765
- But you haven't.
- I've made money.

06:56.845 --> 06:59.405
If you made a lot of money,

06:59.485 --> 07:01.965
I'd buy whatever I want

07:02.045 --> 07:05.525
and travel wherever I want.

07:06.045 --> 07:12.885
The only discomfort now is
your mom's high demand for daily cleaning.

07:13.445 --> 07:15.205
Total bullshit!

07:15.285 --> 07:18.645
My demand for cleaning? Bullshit.

07:22.245 --> 07:23.765
So sometimes I wonder--

07:23.965 --> 07:27.245
am I lucky to have been
born into this family?

07:27.325 --> 07:29.565
Sometimes I feel happy.

07:29.965 --> 07:31.245
And then...

07:31.445 --> 07:33.445
for me personally...

07:34.765 --> 07:37.605
I'd say a speedy death
is the ultimate happiness.

07:37.965 --> 07:40.245
For old people, the faster the happier.

07:40.805 --> 07:42.765
<i>As far back as I could remember,</i>

07:43.245 --> 07:45.485
<i>I always wanted to have</i>
<i>a different family.</i>

07:45.565 --> 07:47.645
I don't want to talk about my daughter!

07:47.725 --> 07:49.725
Wait, let me tell you about my daughter!

07:50.085 --> 07:52.685
<i>A family</i>
<i>not full of yelling and screaming.</i>

07:52.765 --> 07:54.845
The two of them
want to be together!

07:55.205 --> 07:57.685
<i>A family</i>
<i>less controlling of its young generation.</i>

07:57.765 --> 07:59.925
The boy Zhao Jing likes...

08:00.005 --> 08:02.085
Let's meet him to see if we like him.

08:02.165 --> 08:04.325
If not, we'll break them up.

08:04.685 --> 08:07.445
You all think that's control, but I...

08:07.845 --> 08:13.445
I feel that
we have a good education model.

08:13.845 --> 08:16.045
I admit I have a bad temper.

08:16.125 --> 08:18.685
But why did I end up
with this bad temper?

08:18.765 --> 08:20.845
For Mom, she has...

08:21.365 --> 08:23.925
always treated us as little kids.

08:24.005 --> 08:27.485
So she would never let go of control.

08:27.925 --> 08:29.885
<i>So in high school, I rebelled.</i>

08:31.125 --> 08:33.885
<i>When disco came to China, I did disco.</i>

08:37.205 --> 08:39.005
<i>When break dance came, I did that too.</i>

08:40.645 --> 08:43.845
<i>My friends and I were frowned upon.</i>
<i>But China was changing.</i>

08:44.485 --> 08:47.245
<i>And it felt exhilarating</i>
<i>to be able to be different...</i>

08:47.325 --> 08:48.725
<i>...finally.</i>

08:54.365 --> 08:58.285
<i>But I was still keeping a big secret</i>
<i>of how different I truly was.</i>

08:59.525 --> 09:04.885
<i>Because the only Western psychology book</i>
<i>I could find told me I was mentally ill.</i>

09:06.645 --> 09:08.805
I know. I'll never forget it.

09:09.605 --> 09:13.925
I remember you wrote me a letter
at that time.

09:14.645 --> 09:17.525
I... I read it for a long time.

09:18.125 --> 09:20.965
And I remember clearly
I cried for a long time.

09:22.445 --> 09:24.245
Did you ever suspect anything?

09:24.325 --> 09:27.725
I'd never heard of such a thing!
For our generation,

09:28.085 --> 09:31.445
the concept of homosexuality
was nonexistent.

09:31.765 --> 09:33.045
I knew nothing about it.

09:33.405 --> 09:39.085
And those colleagues
of your dad's and mine,

09:39.205 --> 09:41.405
no one knew anything either!

09:42.245 --> 09:47.205
Have you researched online
to understand what this is about?

09:47.685 --> 09:51.525
This I know. This I know, it's a...

09:52.005 --> 09:54.005
what's it called...

09:55.085 --> 09:57.885
It's called... the issue of orientation.

09:58.205 --> 10:00.685
This I know. I know.

10:01.805 --> 10:05.445
Only that-- when this happened to you,

10:06.765 --> 10:08.885
it dealt my dreams...

10:10.925 --> 10:12.285
a devastating blow.

10:15.405 --> 10:16.805
<i>When I turned 20,</i>

10:17.285 --> 10:19.485
<i>I ran away to America.</i>

10:21.685 --> 10:22.565
<i>America,</i>

10:23.125 --> 10:25.005
<i>the land to forget one's past,</i>

10:25.925 --> 10:27.405
<i>to reinvent oneself.</i>

10:28.525 --> 10:33.285
<i>To search for the promise of a happy life</i>
<i>that remains forever elusive,</i>

10:34.125 --> 10:37.965
<i>yet forever inviting</i>
<i>and seemingly within reach.</i>

10:44.805 --> 10:47.205
Look at Empire State,
the tallest building ahead.

10:47.285 --> 10:48.925
<i>But the son of a Chinese family</i>

10:49.005 --> 10:50.805
<i>can never run away from his past.</i>

10:51.525 --> 10:53.285
<i>At least not from his parents.</i>

10:54.285 --> 10:56.445
You told me it's very prosperous,

10:56.845 --> 10:58.725
but it doesn't look that way.

11:00.045 --> 11:02.285
Eric, are you nervous meeting my parents?

11:02.365 --> 11:04.885
Not really.
I only cleaned the apartment three times.

11:06.205 --> 11:08.645
What a mess!

11:10.605 --> 11:12.605
No place to hang a bag.

11:15.285 --> 11:18.165
Such a simple place costs so much money...

11:19.325 --> 11:20.685
This is New York!

11:21.765 --> 11:24.125
Finish it soon so you can rest.

11:25.605 --> 11:27.605
It's so dirty!

11:27.965 --> 11:30.765
Look, the grease has hardened.

11:36.085 --> 11:39.525
Son, can I wash your sneakers?

11:39.605 --> 11:42.605
Son, look how clean your mom made it.

11:45.045 --> 11:49.285
<i>When we finally</i>
<i>ventured out for sight-seeing, unlike Dad,</i>

11:49.365 --> 11:52.085
<i>Mom was not someone easily impressed.</i>

11:52.605 --> 11:56.005
Mom, this is the famous
clam chowder. Do you like it?

11:56.765 --> 11:58.205
Um, how should I put it?

11:59.325 --> 12:02.245
<i>To my great relief, Mom really liked Eric.</i>

12:02.805 --> 12:07.085
<i>A Chinese-American with a stable job</i>
<i>and far better manners than mine.</i>

12:08.845 --> 12:12.965
<i>So, one day I shared with her something</i>
<i>to make her even happier.</i>

12:14.125 --> 12:15.325
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

12:16.645 --> 12:20.165
I adamantly object
to people like you having kids.

12:22.525 --> 12:25.045
If you had a normal family
like your sister's,

12:25.125 --> 12:27.045
I wouldn't object to you having kids.

12:28.085 --> 12:31.045
I imagined that you would remain single,

12:31.285 --> 12:33.565
have a good job and save some money.

12:33.645 --> 12:36.605
So that when you are old
you could afford quality senior care.

12:37.085 --> 12:39.885
If you could die that way,
with enough money,

12:40.125 --> 12:42.685
only that would ease my mind.

12:43.085 --> 12:47.485
Don't you ask yourself
why you went to college and got an MBA?

12:47.845 --> 12:49.965
What do you hope to achieve
in filmmaking?

12:50.045 --> 12:53.245
Even if you do achieve something,
since you're making documentaries,

12:53.325 --> 12:55.005
it won't amount to much.

12:56.645 --> 12:58.885
You guys worry too much.

12:58.965 --> 13:01.365
- My son...
- Worrying is...

13:01.685 --> 13:04.845
a great tradition for us Chinese.

13:04.925 --> 13:07.125
He can't see things

13:07.605 --> 13:09.045
from our standpoint.

13:09.125 --> 13:10.445
You're not in our shoes.

13:10.885 --> 13:14.325
I won't mention your being gay, okay?
Now I can forgive you.

13:14.765 --> 13:18.125
I simply love you too much,
So I have to...

13:19.725 --> 13:21.685
accept what you chose, right?

13:24.085 --> 13:26.125
I think you're exactly like your mom.

13:26.205 --> 13:27.245
In what way?

13:27.845 --> 13:30.605
You are short-tempered.

13:31.845 --> 13:34.845
You refuse to acknowledge
your own shortcomings.

13:37.765 --> 13:39.005
And you have a big heart.

13:43.205 --> 13:44.925
<i>The more my mom objects,</i>

13:45.285 --> 13:48.205
<i>the more I'm determined</i>
<i>to have the life I want.</i>

13:48.725 --> 13:51.685
<i>To build my own family</i>
<i>and give my kids</i>

13:51.765 --> 13:54.645
<i>something I don't think</i>
<i>I ever had from my parents--</i>

13:55.725 --> 13:57.725
<i>the support for being who I am.</i>

13:57.805 --> 14:00.565
We would be-- We never--
This house with me now...

14:00.645 --> 14:03.445
It's Brian. He and Matt
are thinking about having kids.

14:03.525 --> 14:06.245
Hi, Brian.
Everybody's having babies.

14:07.365 --> 14:11.885
<i>Was it, like, complicated to figure out</i>
<i>the logistics of making that happen?</i>

14:11.965 --> 14:16.445
It was quite complicated, so--
so once we found the egg donor agency

14:16.525 --> 14:19.365
we then had to find an IVF clinic

14:19.445 --> 14:22.805
and then once we decided on that,
it was finding surrogates--

14:23.285 --> 14:25.405
<i>Sorry, can you tell me how you guys</i>

14:25.765 --> 14:30.245
<i>reached the first decision</i>
<i>about surrogacy versus other types of--</i>

14:30.325 --> 14:33.565
Oh. Hao's response.

14:34.165 --> 14:35.285
Your approach would be

14:35.365 --> 14:37.485
that the world is already filled
with all these kids

14:37.565 --> 14:40.405
that don't have great families
that in an ideal world

14:40.485 --> 14:42.725
we would wanna adopt but--

14:42.925 --> 14:45.645
Yeah. It's just, like,
my parents are really into

14:45.725 --> 14:47.925
having genetically-related children.

14:48.005 --> 14:52.565
So, I think at some level
I kind of wanna make them happy as well.

14:54.645 --> 14:57.925
Best to find a Chinese egg donor.

15:00.445 --> 15:04.685
I'd prefer our offspring be pureblood.

15:06.285 --> 15:07.365
Absolutely no kids!

15:08.285 --> 15:11.645
If you insist,
I'll divorce your dad for sure!

15:11.725 --> 15:14.565
The egg donor is Chinese,
but the one pregnant is a foreigner?

15:15.205 --> 15:17.445
<i>Big Aunt is Mom's favorite sister</i>

15:17.525 --> 15:22.525
<i>and the only relative Mom has confided in</i>
<i>about my situation.</i>

15:22.805 --> 15:25.605
How old is the egg donor?
What's her education level?

15:26.005 --> 15:29.445
She has to be smart, pretty
and nice-tempered. Where do I find one?

15:30.325 --> 15:32.365
It's not like I'm looking for dates.

15:32.445 --> 15:35.245
- How many weeks along are we?
- Thirty-three and a half.

15:35.725 --> 15:37.845
Down the home stretch.

15:37.925 --> 15:39.445
Do we already know the gender?

15:39.525 --> 15:41.925
- Yes. It's a boy.
- Don't want to ruin the surprise.

15:42.445 --> 15:44.725
<i>I've been praying for this day to come.</i>

15:44.805 --> 15:47.565
Is Shuang Shuang different
from sister's kids?

15:47.725 --> 15:51.005
Very different. Yours is the male line.
Male line or not,

15:51.365 --> 15:55.805
for us old traditional folks,

15:56.485 --> 15:58.405
there is a difference.

15:59.245 --> 16:01.685
Okay.
So, all the this little fuzz is hair.

16:01.765 --> 16:03.645
- Look at that hair!
- Oh!

16:04.445 --> 16:06.365
Are babies usually born with hair?

16:06.445 --> 16:08.325
Oh, and look at that belly.

16:08.405 --> 16:10.845
- Show-off!
- What is he showing off? Sorry.

16:10.925 --> 16:12.685
His practice breathing.

16:14.125 --> 16:16.765
I really have
no other choice, my son.

16:16.845 --> 16:18.605
You think I want this?

16:19.405 --> 16:22.325
I really have no choice,
ever though it still bugs me.

16:22.405 --> 16:26.165
But the kids are on their way, so I can
only encourage you to raise them well.

16:26.245 --> 16:29.085
You think I can accept you now?
I really can't.

16:29.965 --> 16:31.965
I'm happy as long as I have a grandson.

16:33.045 --> 16:34.645
- It's a girl.
- It's a girl.

16:34.725 --> 16:35.725
So give me an update.

16:35.805 --> 16:38.005
How did this all start and how did you do?

16:38.085 --> 16:40.445
Any things going on that
I should be brought up to speed about.

16:40.525 --> 16:41.485
I know. I mean, I--

16:41.565 --> 16:43.125
Let me fill you in here. Okay.

16:43.205 --> 16:44.685
- So, this is Hao.
- Hao.

16:44.765 --> 16:46.765
- And his partner Eric.
- Okay.

16:46.845 --> 16:48.765
- Wanted to go through surrogacy.
- Okay.

16:48.845 --> 16:50.805
They wanted to have two babies,

16:50.885 --> 16:53.445
but they didn't wanna go
through the twin pregnancy.

16:53.525 --> 16:55.165
- Okay.
- So, myself...

16:55.245 --> 16:58.245
and Cortnie, that's also here,
are carrying for them.

16:58.325 --> 17:02.005
So, that's how
our little wonderful story comes together.

17:02.325 --> 17:04.365
- Cortnie and I have been friends forever.
- How are you--

17:04.444 --> 17:06.005
The number is still zero?

17:06.204 --> 17:08.444
- Yeah, right now--
- You-- Right now it's still zero.

17:08.525 --> 17:10.365
You haven't brought a baby home yet.

17:10.444 --> 17:12.605
So, this is all brand new for you still?

17:12.765 --> 17:14.845
I know, so that's why I'm like,

17:14.925 --> 17:16.525
"What questions should I ask?"

17:18.605 --> 17:20.243
It's like, "Where do I go?"

17:20.325 --> 17:21.964
How are you going from zero to two?

17:22.045 --> 17:23.204
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:26.525 --> 17:27.845
So, let's see what that--

17:27.925 --> 17:29.845
His mom is coming up.

17:30.525 --> 17:31.685
Oh, that's awesome.

17:31.765 --> 17:32.925
They met him in April.

17:33.005 --> 17:35.285
Yes, and everything--
Obviously you're still alive

17:35.365 --> 17:36.605
so everything went well.

17:38.005 --> 17:39.565
Because I was like, "Ooh."

17:39.645 --> 17:40.565
The baby!

17:40.645 --> 17:43.645
Now we have all these friends
who want to do the same thing as us.

17:44.525 --> 17:47.125
<i>Everything looks all set</i>
<i>on the American front</i>

17:47.285 --> 17:49.285
<i>for us to welcome our two kids.</i>

17:50.285 --> 17:54.165
<i>But problems occur</i>
<i>whenever I travel back to China for work.</i>

17:54.845 --> 17:59.525
<i>Whenever I see my parents who now</i>
<i>live with my sister's family in Shanghai.</i>

18:02.045 --> 18:04.725
Son, take a nibble at this.
You won't find this in America.

18:04.805 --> 18:07.965
- This tastes good.
- I don't like chicken feet.

18:09.165 --> 18:11.485
In the future, when the kids are grown,

18:11.885 --> 18:15.125
how will you explain it to them?

18:15.205 --> 18:17.405
Just tell them they have two dads.

18:17.485 --> 18:18.765
What about their mother?

18:19.165 --> 18:20.645
No mother. Only surrogate mothers.

18:20.725 --> 18:22.565
Why bother telling them that?

18:23.045 --> 18:25.845
Keep this a secret forever.

18:28.365 --> 18:31.165
I think we should try our best to...

18:32.805 --> 18:35.085
hide this from friends and relatives.

18:36.845 --> 18:39.405
Then how will I explain it
when we bring the kids back?

18:39.765 --> 18:41.685
I'd say their mother...

18:43.005 --> 18:45.285
- Left him?
- Not that.

18:45.605 --> 18:47.725
- Don't say she left you.
- So, she's dead?

18:47.805 --> 18:48.765
That wouldn't do.

18:48.845 --> 18:52.285
How would you explain it then?
I don't know how.

18:53.165 --> 18:57.605
We can say she's an...
illegal immigrant.

18:57.925 --> 19:00.485
Completely illegal.
So, she dare not leave the U.S.

19:04.845 --> 19:07.485
Just tell the truth.
What's the big deal?

19:07.565 --> 19:10.005
- Say she's dead?
- Let's tell the truth!

19:11.085 --> 19:12.725
No way. Absolutely not in China.

19:13.605 --> 19:15.125
Wu Hao, that really won't work.

19:20.445 --> 19:23.365
<i>After having lived</i>
<i>openly and proudly in America</i>

19:23.445 --> 19:24.805
<i>for over 20 years,</i>

19:25.525 --> 19:28.685
<i>I find it frustrating to have to go back</i>
<i>into the closet</i>

19:28.765 --> 19:30.965
<i>whenever I see grandpa in Chengdu.</i>

19:33.045 --> 19:34.845
<i>But that's what my parents want.</i>

19:35.445 --> 19:39.045
<i>And I don't want to create any more drama</i>
<i>before the kids arrive.</i>

19:40.165 --> 19:42.165
Will grandpa be able to understand this?

19:42.245 --> 19:44.965
Grandpa is more stubborn than Mom.

19:46.005 --> 19:48.205
But you never know...

19:48.285 --> 19:53.085
Grandpa, in some ways,
is more open and hip than Mom.

19:53.885 --> 19:54.725
What?

19:54.805 --> 19:58.685
Do you worry like my parents
about me doing films?

19:59.005 --> 20:00.525
- Doing films?
- Yeah.

20:01.525 --> 20:04.805
That's fine. The problem I see...

20:05.365 --> 20:08.045
You should find...

20:08.765 --> 20:10.085
a girlfriend.

20:10.645 --> 20:15.405
Better someone who can work with you.
Right?

20:17.325 --> 20:19.045
<i>For my latest film project</i>

20:19.125 --> 20:20.725
<i>on China's internet celebrities,</i>

20:20.805 --> 20:23.285
<i>I visit my hometown a lot for filming.</i>

20:24.645 --> 20:26.365
<i>Every time I'm back in town,</i>

20:26.805 --> 20:31.885
<i>Grandpa insists on treating me and whoever</i>
<i>is there helping me to a fancy meal.</i>

20:33.525 --> 20:37.325
Hey, where's your companion?

20:37.405 --> 20:39.885
- My assistant is coming soon.
- Oh.

20:40.245 --> 20:41.525
Hello.

20:42.005 --> 20:43.165
How are you?

20:43.445 --> 20:44.925
Sorry for being late.

20:45.805 --> 20:47.805
Grandpa, how old are you?

20:47.885 --> 20:49.885
Over 92 years old.

20:51.045 --> 20:52.325
You are in great health.

20:54.525 --> 20:57.725
- His dad is from Guang'an region.
- Oh.

20:57.805 --> 20:59.405
He was born there.

21:00.285 --> 21:02.165
I'm introducing our family background.

21:03.285 --> 21:05.205
He may skip details.

21:05.285 --> 21:06.405
You live in the U.S.?

21:06.485 --> 21:08.485
Yes. We both live in New York.

21:09.205 --> 21:12.685
Hey! When you come back next year,
bring one more person home.

21:13.685 --> 21:15.445
Why are we talking about this?

21:15.805 --> 21:17.365
She's here to help me film.

21:17.845 --> 21:20.205
Bring back a little rascal.

21:20.285 --> 21:24.805
Next year he will skip the middle steps
and directly bring a kid home.

21:24.885 --> 21:27.245
Do you want a boy or a girl?

21:28.165 --> 21:30.285
It's entirely up to you.

21:30.685 --> 21:34.285
It's not about what I want,
but what you want.

21:35.565 --> 21:37.125
What the two of you want.

21:38.245 --> 21:39.285
Me and her?

21:39.565 --> 21:40.605
How would I know?

21:41.205 --> 21:43.365
Only you would know.

21:44.565 --> 21:47.245
<i>Then,</i>
<i>not knowing what I'm getting myself into,</i>

21:47.525 --> 21:48.925
<i>I become a father.</i>

21:56.365 --> 21:58.045
I'll start to review this...

21:58.525 --> 22:01.165
- Hello!
- Hello.

22:03.045 --> 22:05.365
Did you hear me screaming, huh?

22:06.045 --> 22:07.245
Oh!

22:12.725 --> 22:13.885
Wu Hao,

22:13.965 --> 22:16.565
how come my grandson is so ugly?

22:17.605 --> 22:19.165
As long as he has double eyelids.

22:19.485 --> 22:21.165
I'm worried about single eyelids.

22:21.245 --> 22:23.245
Do you have an outlet outside?

22:24.645 --> 22:27.925
Where's your-- Let me see your teeth.
There's your cute smile.

22:28.005 --> 22:29.765
Brennan, where's your smile?

22:31.325 --> 22:32.925
There, another go. Okay.

22:33.005 --> 22:34.645
Remember to pull his nose.

22:34.725 --> 22:39.725
Do it often, during nap time
or when you play with him. Got it?

22:42.205 --> 22:43.565
There we go.

22:44.965 --> 22:48.005
That was a lot of work wasn't it? I know.

22:48.325 --> 22:51.805
- Hi.
- So different from Clayton's. Nuts.

22:55.725 --> 22:57.085
<i>For over 40 years,</i>

22:57.325 --> 22:59.885
<i>I've had to suffer through</i>
<i>my parents nagging</i>

23:00.565 --> 23:04.885
<i>about how much work parenting is.</i>
<i>How much they've sacrificed to raise us.</i>

23:06.365 --> 23:07.565
<i>Now I'm a father,</i>

23:08.325 --> 23:11.805
<i>I'm finally starting to see</i>
<i>that they were not exaggerating.</i>

23:12.725 --> 23:14.565
As time passes,

23:15.645 --> 23:17.725
as the kids continue...

23:18.365 --> 23:22.325
to grow and mature,

23:22.765 --> 23:25.005
you'll begin to understand

23:25.605 --> 23:27.125
what it takes to be a parent,

23:27.445 --> 23:31.645
and the thoughts and actions
that go with it.

23:32.085 --> 23:35.445
You'll understand it better. Right?

23:46.045 --> 23:47.565
<i>Parenthood changes you.</i>

23:48.405 --> 23:49.245
Jump.

23:51.045 --> 23:52.525
What's so special about the sippy cup?

23:52.605 --> 23:54.845
I'm not gonna tell you on camera.
Just look at this.

23:55.565 --> 23:56.485
Why not?

23:56.565 --> 23:59.445
<i>It makes me wonder</i>
<i>what it means to have a family.</i>

23:59.525 --> 24:02.405
<i>And how much help you need</i>
<i>to build a family.</i>

24:05.045 --> 24:06.885
You are just so sweet. Who is that?

24:08.325 --> 24:12.245
<i>And it makes me miss my family</i>
<i>a continent and an ocean away</i>

24:12.725 --> 24:15.525
<i>regardless of how noisy and nutty it is.</i>

24:16.885 --> 24:18.765
Can you see me, Leni?

24:27.205 --> 24:31.445
Now that you have kids
and I can't give you any help,

24:31.525 --> 24:34.485
I feel very guilty.
Your life has been so tough already.

24:34.965 --> 24:37.965
Mom, why on Earth
are you talking about this?

24:38.965 --> 24:41.925
Happy birthday, little one.
Look how happy you are!

24:46.765 --> 24:49.405
We'll visit grandparents
in February, okay?

24:49.605 --> 24:53.045
A few more months
and our Leni will turn one.

24:53.125 --> 24:54.525
We'll go home then, okay?

25:00.845 --> 25:02.405
Clayton, where are we?

25:02.765 --> 25:06.045
We are in Shanghai now.

25:06.725 --> 25:09.925
<i>Before I take the kids</i>
<i>to see my family for Chinese New Year,</i>

25:10.685 --> 25:14.005
<i>we meet with my sister</i>
<i>and my brother-in-law to strategize.</i>

25:16.245 --> 25:18.285
I come here today to discuss

25:18.365 --> 25:20.845
if I should go tell grandpa first.

25:21.285 --> 25:22.605
Don't tell him.

25:23.445 --> 25:24.485
Don't tell him?

25:24.725 --> 25:29.045
It'd confuse the old guy
and cause a lot of trouble.

25:29.965 --> 25:30.845
It's true.

25:30.925 --> 25:33.365
But my grandpa is hipper than most.

25:35.485 --> 25:37.685
I've been observing Grandpa.

25:39.125 --> 25:42.365
He's all about fighting
the Japanese and the Americans.

25:42.445 --> 25:45.685
He's been totally brainwashed
by the Communist Party.

25:45.765 --> 25:49.725
Don't expect him to be able to change.

25:50.005 --> 25:54.005
Just give him what he wants.
Like he's pissed at Trump.

25:54.445 --> 25:56.565
He wants to fight him.
I said we couldn't win.

25:57.245 --> 25:59.245
So he considered me a loser.

26:03.285 --> 26:06.405
We've told him
that you are bringing two kids home.

26:06.485 --> 26:08.165
He didn't ask any questions.

26:08.245 --> 26:09.125
He didn't?

26:09.205 --> 26:10.925
Nope. How do you want to handle this?

26:11.005 --> 26:13.605
I'd planned to think about this,

26:14.005 --> 26:16.845
but I've been too exhausted by the kids
and the jet lag.

26:16.925 --> 26:18.645
What if we just tell him the truth?

26:33.845 --> 26:35.605
<i>To minimize complication,</i>

26:36.045 --> 26:37.845
<i>Eric decides not to show up</i>

26:37.925 --> 26:40.205
<i>when the family meets the kids</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

26:40.885 --> 26:42.445
This is Grandma.

26:42.525 --> 26:45.245
Let Grandma hold you.

26:45.325 --> 26:49.245
Let me hold you, Grandma's precious.

26:49.965 --> 26:52.005
Let Grandma hold you. It is okay.

26:52.085 --> 26:54.085
Don't cry. Don't cry.

26:54.165 --> 26:55.925
Good boy.

26:56.005 --> 26:57.525
- Where's Grandpa?
- Grandpa?

26:57.605 --> 26:58.645
Grandpa is here.

26:59.165 --> 27:01.925
Say hi to your great-grandpa.

27:02.725 --> 27:04.445
Hello.

27:04.685 --> 27:06.205
The little one is on the floor.

27:06.285 --> 27:08.245
This one is more outgoing.

27:08.325 --> 27:09.885
Come sit down, Grandpa.

27:09.965 --> 27:12.085
This one is outgoing,
the other one clingy.

27:12.925 --> 27:14.365
- This here.
- Yeah?

27:14.965 --> 27:18.045
Remember to pull it.

27:18.245 --> 27:20.445
- Why the nose?
- Do it often.

27:20.565 --> 27:23.485
- Then he won't have a flat nose.
- Okay, a flat nose.

27:23.565 --> 27:25.565
Especially during...

27:25.805 --> 27:28.205
the first few months after birth,

27:28.525 --> 27:30.685
if you do it then,
the result will be even better.

27:31.325 --> 27:33.325
- Clayton.
- Hello.

27:35.565 --> 27:37.725
<i>I know the question's definitely coming,</i>

27:37.805 --> 27:43.045
<i>so I look for my mother to offer her</i>
<i>version of the truth before I'm ready.</i>

27:43.205 --> 27:44.525
Oh...

27:45.565 --> 27:49.005
<i>But Mom, as usual,</i>
<i>is busy working in the kitchen.</i>

27:50.965 --> 27:52.325
His mother didn't come?

27:52.405 --> 27:54.045
- Huh?
- She is not here?

27:54.725 --> 27:56.565
No, she didn't.

27:56.885 --> 27:59.245
- You brought both back by yourself.
- Well...

28:00.685 --> 28:02.805
Hey, Emma, be careful!

28:03.325 --> 28:04.485
So heavy.

28:05.125 --> 28:06.605
Where's his mother from?

28:07.285 --> 28:08.325
Huh?

28:08.645 --> 28:09.885
Where's she from?

28:10.885 --> 28:12.965
Where is her hometown?

28:13.045 --> 28:14.405
America.

28:14.485 --> 28:16.805
Hometown? Both kids are American.

28:17.165 --> 28:18.405
American?

28:18.485 --> 28:20.605
They are American
because they were born there.

28:20.685 --> 28:22.445
He's American,

28:22.525 --> 28:26.245
but I was asking
where your wife's hometown is.

28:26.845 --> 28:27.805
America.

28:27.885 --> 28:29.285
- She's American, too?
- Yeah.

28:29.365 --> 28:32.205
- She was born in America.
- Born in America?

28:34.925 --> 28:36.525
So, an American-born Chinese.

28:38.885 --> 28:40.205
- Let Mom tell him.
- Eh?

28:40.285 --> 28:42.565
- Let Mom explain.
- Let her explain?

28:42.925 --> 28:45.205
- Let her do whatever...
- It's exhausting?

28:45.285 --> 28:46.765
- What?
- Is it exhausting?

28:47.525 --> 28:50.285
I don't know where to start.
Raising kids is not as hard.

28:50.365 --> 28:52.205
Wow, you can eat this by yourself!

28:53.845 --> 28:56.365
Mom said to ask Eric
to come over for lunch.

28:56.445 --> 28:58.765
Wouldn't that be even more awkward?

28:59.325 --> 29:02.445
Let's bring this out in
the open so Hao doesn't have to struggle.

29:02.525 --> 29:05.165
It's already a done deal.
Why would it matter?

29:05.765 --> 29:07.605
So, we'll go ahead and tell Grandpa?

29:10.285 --> 29:11.165
Okay.

29:13.005 --> 29:14.765
<i>I don't know what's holding me back.</i>

29:15.165 --> 29:18.925
<i>I don't remember being this indecisive</i>
<i>when I came out for the first time.</i>

29:21.005 --> 29:22.005
Mom.

29:22.365 --> 29:23.965
Just say Hao...

29:24.045 --> 29:27.005
How should we explain Eric to Grandpa?

29:27.085 --> 29:28.845
Just say he's a colleague.

29:29.685 --> 29:32.645
But they look so intimate together.

29:33.485 --> 29:37.125
Ugh, it's not a big deal.
They are good friends.

29:37.405 --> 29:39.325
A close colleague and a good friend.

29:40.845 --> 29:42.845
It doesn't look right.

29:42.925 --> 29:45.005
You Grandpa
doesn't pay attention to details.

29:45.085 --> 29:46.045
Let's talk later.

29:46.125 --> 29:49.885
Grandpa has been asking
both Big Aunt and me.

29:50.725 --> 29:53.405
- He asked me and Big Aunt.
- He asked you, too?

29:53.485 --> 29:54.365
Oh, yeah.

29:54.965 --> 29:57.525
The mother is busy with work in America.

29:58.765 --> 30:00.765
Grandpa, this is Eric.

30:01.005 --> 30:03.565
Happy New Year.

30:04.925 --> 30:08.805
You sit. You sit.
I'll sit on the floor. You sit.

30:09.085 --> 30:11.485
- Sit over here.
- You sit, Grandpa.

30:18.565 --> 30:20.805
<i>Eric, are you bothered by all this?</i>

30:21.285 --> 30:24.325
No. I think
it's all part of being in a family.

30:27.005 --> 30:28.245
Little Aunt is here.

30:29.165 --> 30:30.845
Say hi to your Great Aunt.

30:31.205 --> 30:33.205
- Is this for real?
- Of course it is.

30:33.285 --> 30:35.765
- Then where is her mother?
- Huh?

30:35.845 --> 30:39.925
Her mother. I've never met her.
You have to introduce us.

30:40.005 --> 30:41.645
You must be joking!

30:41.925 --> 30:43.925
How on Earth could it be possible?

30:44.005 --> 30:46.605
Even a shotgun wedding
wouldn't be this fast.

30:47.245 --> 30:50.125
Sis, whose kid is this?

30:50.365 --> 30:52.365
Both are my son's.

30:52.525 --> 30:55.045
- Both? How many are there?
- Two.

30:55.125 --> 30:57.205
- Both.
- The other one is napping.

30:57.285 --> 30:58.565
There are two!

30:58.645 --> 31:02.765
I feel like I'm being struck by thunder!

31:02.845 --> 31:05.365
I pulled her into the bathroom
and told her.

31:05.605 --> 31:09.125
It's time to tell her.
It's already an irreversible fact.

31:09.605 --> 31:11.485
I was shocked out of my mind.

31:11.565 --> 31:14.485
That night I couldn't sleep all night.

31:15.845 --> 31:16.765
Oh, dear...

31:17.365 --> 31:20.125
It's irreversible, right?

31:23.925 --> 31:26.685
You probably don't know this,
so let me tell you,

31:26.765 --> 31:30.565
our Zhang family has Hao as the only son.

31:30.645 --> 31:33.285
My father is especially nice to him.

31:33.365 --> 31:35.045
- Is that right?
- Oh, yeah.

31:35.125 --> 31:38.205
He heard Hao's coming to Shanghai,
so he came all the way...

31:51.965 --> 31:53.445
Okay, let's do another toast.

31:53.525 --> 31:55.045
Great fortune, everyone!

31:55.125 --> 31:57.045
Cheers.

31:57.965 --> 31:59.565
Great fortune, everyone!

32:06.525 --> 32:08.685
- Sound check.
- Hello, hello.

32:09.285 --> 32:11.285
- Okay, good.
- Does it sound good?

32:11.525 --> 32:13.525
Well, what's there to talk about?

32:13.645 --> 32:16.165
I'm getting close to expiring already.

32:17.365 --> 32:18.805
It's all pointless.

32:19.885 --> 32:23.125
How long did it take you
to get through that?

32:24.325 --> 32:27.565
It took me two to three years.

32:28.085 --> 32:29.045
At least.

32:30.005 --> 32:33.365
The first six months
were extremely painful.

32:35.565 --> 32:37.565
I couldn't make any sense of it.

32:38.885 --> 32:41.525
I couldn't get over it.
That precious son of mine,

32:41.805 --> 32:43.045
what happened to him?

32:44.005 --> 32:48.725
When I had my son,
I loved and treasured him.

32:48.805 --> 32:51.845
Plus I had a son and a daughter.
I was so happy.

32:52.125 --> 32:56.205
On top of that, both were great kids.
So, to tell you the truth...

32:57.085 --> 33:03.125
I was happy and satisfied
through and through.

33:03.485 --> 33:05.605
But I never imagined that...

33:06.325 --> 33:11.085
my son would change into that.

33:12.085 --> 33:14.845
I couldn't accept it.

33:15.805 --> 33:16.925
Very painful.

33:17.565 --> 33:20.805
So, I never dared to tell your grandpa.

33:20.885 --> 33:25.645
Your grandpa used to say that our family
finally had a son, a descendant.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.645
So, even now your grandpa doesn't know.

33:37.045 --> 33:38.405
Ah!

33:39.245 --> 33:41.165
<i>Chinese New Year used to represent</i>

33:41.245 --> 33:43.925
<i>everything I disliked about being Chinese.</i>

33:44.165 --> 33:46.125
Everyone sit down.
Grandpa wants to eat.

33:46.205 --> 33:47.085
Come on!

33:47.165 --> 33:49.205
<i>The absolute respect for elders.</i>

33:49.765 --> 33:52.365
<i>The face-saving lies and pretenses.</i>

33:53.485 --> 33:56.645
<i>Their inability to communicate</i>
<i>unless around food.</i>

33:57.845 --> 34:01.205
<i>And being forced to eat</i>
<i>because it's all for your own good.</i>

34:03.045 --> 34:04.925
Enough! Enough!

34:05.005 --> 34:07.085
Give them to me! I'll feed him.

34:07.165 --> 34:09.725
You think you can make him eat!

34:09.804 --> 34:11.045
Come, my precious.

34:11.405 --> 34:13.445
Come, Grandma loves you.

34:13.525 --> 34:17.045
<i>In my Chinese family, love means worries.</i>

34:17.764 --> 34:20.885
<i>Which leads to control</i>
<i>to allay those worries.</i>

34:21.445 --> 34:24.125
<i>All of which</i>
<i>I couldn't wait to run away from.</i>

34:25.165 --> 34:27.005
Grandma welcomes you to stay.

34:27.085 --> 34:29.525
Why don't you ditch your dad
and live with Grandma?

34:29.605 --> 34:30.804
I'll get a nanny.

34:31.165 --> 34:33.885
He's like, "I don't understand
your Sichuan dialect."

34:34.925 --> 34:36.405
Yes. It is true.

34:40.045 --> 34:42.045
<i>But once I decided to make a film</i>

34:42.125 --> 34:44.205
<i>about my struggles with this control,</i>

34:45.165 --> 34:49.284
<i>once I interviewed my family and learned</i>
<i>how my coming out had hurt them,</i>

34:50.165 --> 34:53.005
<i>I no longer have the heart</i>
<i>to come out to my grandpa,</i>

34:54.085 --> 34:56.125
<i>which would hurt them all over again.</i>

34:57.885 --> 34:59.405
<i>Now as a parent myself.</i>

35:02.605 --> 35:05.765
Everyone get on! Hurry!

35:07.085 --> 35:10.045
Mom still objects.
She talked about it again last night.

35:10.125 --> 35:11.285
- She did?
- Yeah.

35:11.485 --> 35:15.325
She still said not to tell Grandpa.

35:15.405 --> 35:16.885
Then we don't tell Grandpa.

35:16.965 --> 35:19.405
I argued with her for a long time.

35:20.285 --> 35:23.005
It's okay. Everyone knows now,
except Grandpa.

35:23.085 --> 35:25.005
Grandpa is actually getting it, a little.

35:25.085 --> 35:27.085
- You think so?
- A little bit.

35:27.365 --> 35:28.845
Notice he's stopped asking?

35:29.325 --> 35:30.765
Indeed, he's stopped.

35:31.445 --> 35:35.165
He stopped asking
once he met Eric yesterday.

35:36.565 --> 35:38.965
Grandpa, do you want to ride bicycles?

35:39.725 --> 35:42.005
Grandpa, this makes you happy, right?

35:42.205 --> 35:45.845
Being surrounded
by family and kids. Right?

35:46.245 --> 35:47.405
Sure, I'm happy.

35:48.485 --> 35:49.525
I'm happy.

35:50.765 --> 35:53.405
Do you still object
to my having kids?

35:54.725 --> 35:57.325
I still feel uncomfortable inside.

35:57.765 --> 36:00.325
What's uncomfortable?
We have such a good life now.

36:01.245 --> 36:04.925
- The four of us.
- I still feel it's not normal.

36:05.005 --> 36:09.005
But isn't my family
happier than your family?

36:09.085 --> 36:11.805
- What family?
- Happier than your "normal" family.

36:11.885 --> 36:12.965
Mine is not normal?

36:13.045 --> 36:15.565
I mean your family is normal,
but is it happy?

36:15.645 --> 36:18.005
- Why not?
- You and dad quarrel every day.

36:18.805 --> 36:21.245
You sometimes quarrel with Eric, too.

36:21.325 --> 36:27.045
It's natural. All families have conflicts.
They are unavoidable.

36:27.125 --> 36:30.845
- But you and Dad quarrel every single day.
- That's not true.

36:31.365 --> 36:34.605
With you two, I worry about the future.

36:35.045 --> 36:36.885
- What do you mean?
- Can you two stay together

36:36.965 --> 36:40.845
and raise the kids well?

36:41.605 --> 36:42.645
Why not?

36:42.885 --> 36:45.205
The divorce rate is high

36:45.525 --> 36:50.085
even for straight couples,
not to mention your type of relationship.

36:50.165 --> 36:52.965
Plus, when the kids grow older,

36:53.045 --> 36:55.645
what if they ask about their mother?

36:55.725 --> 36:57.645
No mother. They have two dads.

36:57.725 --> 36:59.565
"But where is my mother?

36:59.645 --> 37:03.925
All other kids have a mom and a dad.

37:04.085 --> 37:07.965
Why do I only have dads?"
How will you explain it then?

37:08.045 --> 37:11.205
I'll pity my grandchildren
whenever I see them

37:11.285 --> 37:15.925
because they lack the love of a mother.

37:16.125 --> 37:18.645
To be honest, you are my son,

37:20.005 --> 37:22.045
so it pains me...

37:22.285 --> 37:24.205
So, you decide what you do.

37:27.765 --> 37:32.525
Her-- Her way of thinking... I get it.

37:34.645 --> 37:36.845
I get what she's thinking.

37:41.045 --> 37:42.005
Mom.

37:46.325 --> 37:49.445
It's funny how,
when you were young...

37:49.725 --> 37:52.885
the truth is more important
than anything else.

37:53.245 --> 37:55.245
Now as you get older, you feel that...

37:57.805 --> 37:59.605
what's important
is not just truth,

37:59.685 --> 38:03.365
but also there are other things
that are as important.

38:03.685 --> 38:05.645
For example, other people's feelings.

38:07.045 --> 38:08.525
As long as I don't--

38:09.525 --> 38:12.285
I don't have--
I don't have to live in a lie,

38:12.645 --> 38:15.205
and also as long as...

38:17.245 --> 38:20.565
I'm not being denied to live the way
I want to live my life.

38:23.965 --> 38:26.645
<i>Soon enough, my kids will grow up</i>

38:26.725 --> 38:28.365
<i>and want to run away from me.</i>

38:29.405 --> 38:32.965
<i>I only hope they know</i>
<i>they have a family to return to</i>

38:33.525 --> 38:35.525
<i>regardless of our differences.</i>

38:35.885 --> 38:37.805
What's making you so happy, Clayton?
