Yes! Hit him!

00:27.244 --> 00:28.898
Hit him again!
Kill him!

00:28.985 --> 00:31.248
- Kill that son of a bitch!
- Uh, do you wanna just--

00:31.335 --> 00:34.643
Yeah! Break his face!

01:21.516 --> 01:24.345
So...you must hit
a lot of guys, huh?

01:24.432 --> 01:27.826
Well, I'm a cop, so it comes
with the job sometimes.

01:27.913 --> 01:29.567
It's only ever self--

01:29.654 --> 01:33.832
That is so hot. I would love
to see you hit someone.

01:33.919 --> 01:37.053
Oh. Uh... maybe.

[screaming]

03:08.927 --> 03:11.843
[theme music]

03:20.939 --> 03:23.377
Charlotte Mitchell was her name.
She was a book writer

03:23.464 --> 03:24.595
writing a book.

03:24.682 --> 03:26.162
Got control
of the crime scene.

03:26.249 --> 03:27.250
It's gonna be
a wide suspect list.

03:27.337 --> 03:28.686
Get statements from

03:28.773 --> 03:30.427
all the security guards,
vendors, and attendants.

03:30.514 --> 03:31.820
Find out who could
get backstage.

03:31.907 --> 03:33.691
Right. It's gonna be
hundreds, at least.

03:33.778 --> 03:35.693
Look, uh, just to be clear..

03:35.780 --> 03:37.304
...I don't own this arena.

03:37.391 --> 03:40.698
I simply promoted the fight.
I have no liability here.

03:40.785 --> 03:42.744
What was Charlotte Mitchell's
connection to you?

03:42.831 --> 03:44.833
She was writing a book
about this fight

03:44.920 --> 03:48.184
about my guy Manny Flaco
and Rowdy Merriman.

03:48.271 --> 03:51.405
She said it was
a microcosm of whatever.

03:51.492 --> 03:56.061
I...I figured any P.R.,
for my boy Manny is good P.R.

03:56.148 --> 03:57.454
That's the kind
of kid he is.

03:57.541 --> 03:59.456
Got the initial report
from the ME.

03:59.543 --> 04:00.979
Shot twice, close range.

04:01.066 --> 04:03.112
'Had a purse,
money, jewelry all intact.'

04:03.199 --> 04:05.245
Estimated time of death.
8:30, 9:00 p.m.

04:05.332 --> 04:08.378
That was right
in the middle of the fight.

04:08.465 --> 04:10.728
When was the last time
you saw Ms. Mitchell?

04:10.815 --> 04:14.123
[sighing]
We were supposed to sit
together during the fight.

04:14.210 --> 04:16.299
She didn't show up.

04:16.386 --> 04:20.869
Sir, why are you staring
at me like that?

04:20.956 --> 04:22.697
I was staring?

04:22.784 --> 04:26.831
Oh, I'm so sorry.
My mind was elsewhere.

04:26.918 --> 04:29.486
That's Charlotte Mitchell,
right? And you're, uh..

04:29.573 --> 04:33.055
And you're
Leonard Artash, promoter.

04:33.142 --> 04:34.665
Let's go talk
to the fighters, shall we?

04:34.752 --> 04:36.276
Really?

04:36.363 --> 04:38.365
Well, Rigsby just told us
it wasn't a robbery.

04:38.452 --> 04:40.018
We know it wasn't sexual.

04:40.105 --> 04:44.240
Looks like it was in cold blood,
so not a crime of passion.

04:44.327 --> 04:46.938
What's that leave us?
I'd bet your pension

04:47.025 --> 04:48.723
this has something
to do with the fight.

04:48.810 --> 04:51.203
But Manny and Merriman
were in the cage.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.032
- When she was shot.
- Are you a detective?

04:54.119 --> 04:56.687
- No.
- Well, then..

04:56.774 --> 05:00.735
Manny Flaco, you're the man.
You were fantastic in there.

05:00.822 --> 05:03.303
Messed him up
like he was dog meat.

05:03.390 --> 05:05.435
You're gonna be champion
of the world. You hear me?

05:05.522 --> 05:06.828
'Champion of the world.'

05:09.265 --> 05:10.571
Gotta deal with this now?

05:10.658 --> 05:12.486
Yes, ma'am, we do.

05:12.573 --> 05:15.184
What's the problem, Mia?
Who are those guys?

05:15.271 --> 05:18.187
- They're cops.
- Oh, come on now. Can it wait?

05:18.274 --> 05:19.884
Let the kid enjoy his win.

05:19.971 --> 05:21.146
Talk to him after he
checks in with the doctor.

05:21.233 --> 05:22.496
I don't need the doc.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.019
Hey, better safe
than sorry, right?

05:24.106 --> 05:25.716
Manny's got nothing
to do with this.

05:25.803 --> 05:27.370
Nothing to do with what?

05:27.457 --> 05:29.720
Charlotte Mitchell was murdered
earlier this evening.

05:29.807 --> 05:32.506
Charlotte murdered? Oh, my God.

05:32.593 --> 05:33.985
Just stay cool.
Don't get excited.

05:34.072 --> 05:36.553
She was found shot to death
in a service corridor

05:36.640 --> 05:39.121
underneath the arena.
It happened during your fight.

05:39.208 --> 05:40.818
You knew and you didn't tell me?

05:40.905 --> 05:42.385
Manny, come on. You know
we're trying to protect you.

05:42.472 --> 05:44.213
Listen, I didn't wanna
spoil your night.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.649
Who did this?

05:45.736 --> 05:47.390
That's what we're
looking to find out.

05:47.477 --> 05:50.132
You liked her a lot, huh?
This lady, uh, what's her name?

05:50.219 --> 05:53.527
- What's her name?
- Charlotte Mitchell.

05:53.614 --> 05:54.963
Yeah, I liked her.

05:55.050 --> 05:57.748
Everybody liked her.
She was good people.

05:57.835 --> 06:01.448
Yeah, she was.

06:01.535 --> 06:04.625
Okay.

06:04.712 --> 06:06.627
Great.
Well, thank you.

06:06.714 --> 06:08.193
Uh, where's Merriman's room?

06:08.280 --> 06:09.543
Oh. So we're
done now, are we?

06:09.630 --> 06:10.892
Oh, I'm sorry.
You have some questions.

06:10.979 --> 06:14.330
- Yeah.
- She has some questions.

06:16.071 --> 06:18.943
[instrumental music]

06:28.736 --> 06:30.781
You don't wanna
go back there.

06:30.868 --> 06:33.480
These aren't the droids
you're looking for.

06:40.530 --> 06:44.186
Argh!

06:44.273 --> 06:46.101
[grunting]

06:46.188 --> 06:47.494
[panting]

06:47.581 --> 06:49.017
Tough night, huh?

06:49.104 --> 06:51.933
Uh, listen.
Consolation-wise

06:52.020 --> 06:53.543
you know what Nietzsche said?

06:53.630 --> 06:57.547
Was uns nicht umbringt,
macht uns staerker.

06:57.634 --> 06:59.375
Man, who the hell areyou?
You know what?

06:59.462 --> 07:01.072
I don't even care.
Get your butt outta here!

07:01.159 --> 07:03.423
I'm CBI.
I'm investigating a murder.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.599
- Oh, you're a cop?
- Well, not officially.

07:05.686 --> 07:07.775
No, man, screw murder.
I got a robbery to report.

07:07.862 --> 07:09.385
That little fanny-pack Flaco
wouldn't have won dip

07:09.472 --> 07:11.256
if he didn't have
the stinkin' ref in his pocket!

07:11.343 --> 07:13.389
Son of a bitch was
head-buttin' me the whole night!

07:13.476 --> 07:15.870
Ouch.

07:15.957 --> 07:18.568
- Who got murdered?
- Charlotte Mitchell.

07:18.655 --> 07:22.006
No kiddin'?
The book writer?

07:22.093 --> 07:24.792
Damn. That's messed up.

07:24.879 --> 07:28.709
Ain't gonna be
no book now, I guess. Huh.

07:28.796 --> 07:32.321
They rape her as well?
She was kinda hot.

07:32.408 --> 07:33.453
Hello?

07:38.109 --> 07:40.460
[chuckling]

07:40.547 --> 07:42.244
Either you're
a genius manipulator

07:42.331 --> 07:45.160
concealing your
complicity in the case.

07:45.247 --> 07:50.861
Or you're a...
dimly lit clown.

07:50.948 --> 07:51.993
Which is it?

07:55.344 --> 07:56.563
[instrumental music]

07:59.348 --> 08:00.654
You were right, big man.

08:00.741 --> 08:02.394
'Say that again,
you son of a bitch!'

08:02.482 --> 08:04.309
Why don't you get back here, see
what runnin' your mouth's gonn--

08:04.396 --> 08:08.400
Hey!Hey!
Leave him alone.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.663
He's a cop.

08:13.623 --> 08:15.320
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

08:15.407 --> 08:18.323
I'll get back to you.

08:18.410 --> 08:21.457
Ballistics came back.
9-millimeter weapon.

08:21.544 --> 08:23.764
Rifling patterns
and striations on the bullets

08:23.851 --> 08:25.635
indicate the gun used
to kill Charlotte Mitchell

08:25.722 --> 08:28.420
was also used in a murder
back in 2001.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.161
The weapon
was never recovered.

08:30.248 --> 08:32.076
The killer was a man
named Joe Reyes.

08:32.163 --> 08:34.818
Got out eight months ago.
Early release.

08:34.905 --> 08:36.994
Cho's still working through
suspects from the arena.

08:37.081 --> 08:38.474
Take Rigsby
and talk to Reyes.

08:38.561 --> 08:40.302
Find out what happened
to that gun.

08:40.389 --> 08:42.217
I'm gonna go talk
to the victim's father.

08:42.304 --> 08:44.262
Rigsby's busy.

08:44.349 --> 08:45.481
With what?

08:45.568 --> 08:47.352
Mr. LaRoche
is interviewing him.

08:47.439 --> 08:48.615
Oh?

08:48.702 --> 08:51.356
A man named Todd Johnson
was murdered

08:51.443 --> 08:53.054
while in CBI custody.

08:53.141 --> 08:55.883
Yes. Cop killer,
burned to death in his cell.

08:55.970 --> 09:00.322
I just wanted to get
your opinion on some things.

09:00.409 --> 09:03.586
You were an arson investigator
before coming to CBI, right?

09:03.673 --> 09:05.240
Yeah, in San Diego.

09:05.327 --> 09:07.068
Yeah.
Are you familiar with..

09:09.287 --> 09:11.376
...pyrophoric igniters?

09:11.463 --> 09:13.248
Sure. Liquid or solid?

09:13.335 --> 09:16.599
Used in conjunction
with a xylene accelerant?

09:18.079 --> 09:20.298
- Overkill, I'd say.
- Really?

09:20.385 --> 09:24.738
And the fire safety system
here in CBI..

09:24.825 --> 09:27.044
...easy to access
and deactivate?

09:27.131 --> 09:28.959
Top of the line
ESFR system? No.

09:29.046 --> 09:31.919
Bypassing that
took real know-how.

09:32.006 --> 09:35.575
You could deactivate it,
couldn't you?

09:35.662 --> 09:36.793
Yes, I could.

09:38.621 --> 09:41.450
Are you accusing me?

09:41.537 --> 09:42.886
Are you confessing?

09:42.973 --> 09:44.105
[chuckling]

09:49.066 --> 09:53.288
Your father is
Steven Robert Rigsby.

09:53.375 --> 09:54.724
Yes, he is.

09:54.811 --> 09:56.378
What does he got to do
with the investigation?

09:56.465 --> 09:57.858
Used to be affiliated

09:57.945 --> 10:00.512
with the Iron Gods
Motorcycle Gang, yes?

10:00.600 --> 10:01.775
Well, you know he was.

10:01.862 --> 10:03.820
Yes, I have his sheet here.

10:05.996 --> 10:07.215
Robbery.

10:07.302 --> 10:08.912
Narcotics.

10:08.999 --> 10:10.740
Assault.

10:10.827 --> 10:14.657
Manslaughter.
Quite the rascal.

10:14.744 --> 10:16.920
Look, I have nothing
to do with my father.

10:17.007 --> 10:20.010
Nothing at all?
No card at Christmas?

10:20.097 --> 10:21.882
Nope. We don't talk.
I don't know where he is.

10:21.969 --> 10:23.710
[door opening]
'LaRoche.'

10:23.797 --> 10:25.015
You're supposed to inform me

10:25.102 --> 10:26.843
when you talk
to one of my people.

10:26.930 --> 10:29.237
That's not a right.

10:29.324 --> 10:31.979
That's a courtesy
we extend on occasion.

10:32.066 --> 10:33.284
Well, in the future

10:33.371 --> 10:36.157
I'd like you to extend
that courtesy to me.

10:39.900 --> 10:43.251
Thank you, Agent Rigsby.
That should do it.

11:16.240 --> 11:19.896
My gun? A-a woman was killed
with my gun?

11:19.983 --> 11:21.985
Same one you used
back in 2001.

11:22.072 --> 11:24.031

11:24.118 --> 11:25.946
So you just cannot

11:29.645 --> 11:30.907

11:30.994 --> 11:32.648
Did you know
Charlotte Mitchell?

11:32.735 --> 11:34.128
No, ma'am, I did not

11:34.215 --> 11:35.607
and I don't have that gun
anymore either.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.174
Got rid of it back when
you shot that guy?

11:38.872 --> 11:40.221
[Wayne]
'What did you do with it?'

11:40.308 --> 11:42.179
I gave it to a lady friend
of mine at the time.

11:42.266 --> 11:43.964
What didshedo with it?

11:44.051 --> 11:46.227
That I don't know. I haven't
seen her since my arrest.

11:46.314 --> 11:47.707
What was the lady's name?

11:47.794 --> 11:49.447
Uh, Dawn.
Dawn May.

11:50.666 --> 11:53.060
- Address?
- Don't know.

11:53.147 --> 11:55.453
Like I said, I didn't look
for her when I got out.

11:55.540 --> 11:59.066
After finding my faith,
I realize I had to turn my back

11:59.153 --> 12:00.850
on all my evil ways
and all the people

12:00.937 --> 12:02.460
that could possibly
lead me back there.

12:03.984 --> 12:05.725
Alright.
Thanks for your time.

12:07.901 --> 12:09.903
Why did you kill that man
back in 2001?

12:09.990 --> 12:11.034
If you don't mind
my asking.

12:13.254 --> 12:14.995
[scoffing]

12:15.082 --> 12:16.257
I don't know, ma'am.

12:17.562 --> 12:19.956
It was foolishness.

12:20.043 --> 12:21.958
Look, I-I did a lot of
bad things back in the day.

12:23.655 --> 12:25.092
And that was just the one
they caught me for.

12:27.572 --> 12:29.487
This is God's plan.

12:38.366 --> 12:39.976
[female #1]
'Here it is. I found it.'

12:40.063 --> 12:41.151
[male #1]
'Good, good, good. Okay.'

12:41.238 --> 12:42.979
- 'Hold it up.'
- 'Dad.'

12:43.066 --> 12:46.635
'No, come on. Hold it up.
Higher, higher, higher. Okay.'

12:46.722 --> 12:48.419
'It's just a town hall report.'

12:48.506 --> 12:51.031
'No, it's your first
newspaper article--'

12:54.164 --> 12:55.296
[sighing]

12:56.776 --> 12:59.474
She was a good girl.

12:59.561 --> 13:01.215
A fine human being.

13:03.347 --> 13:04.914
We're sorry for your loss,
Mr. Mitchell.

13:05.001 --> 13:06.437
Hmm. Thank you.

13:08.352 --> 13:11.007
Would you mind terribly if I
just took a little look around?

13:11.094 --> 13:12.922
Uh, no, uh, not at all.

13:13.009 --> 13:16.447
The kitchen is, uh, there,
and her office is this way.

13:20.843 --> 13:21.801
These..

13:23.628 --> 13:24.934
...are her notebooks.

13:26.414 --> 13:27.807
She kept good notes.

13:28.720 --> 13:29.852
'I taught her that.'

13:32.855 --> 13:34.901
I apologized to her
only last week

13:34.988 --> 13:36.903
teaching her
a dying profession.

13:38.992 --> 13:40.297
Journalism's dying,
you know.

13:43.083 --> 13:45.215
All this..

13:45.302 --> 13:46.216
...internet.

13:48.131 --> 13:50.090
Uh, maybe we should go in
the living room, Mr. Mitchell.

13:51.308 --> 13:52.614
Uh, yeah. Um..

13:53.876 --> 13:55.182
I'll take this.

13:57.184 --> 13:58.359
I'll be right there.

14:04.321 --> 14:05.757
Can I get you something
to drink, Mr. Mitchell?

14:05.845 --> 14:07.194
Some water, maybe?

14:07.281 --> 14:09.849
Yeah. That would be
very nice, thank you.

14:18.770 --> 14:20.207
[man on TV]
'It's newspaper articles.'

14:20.294 --> 14:22.644
No, I've been published
in real newspapers before.

14:22.731 --> 14:24.124
Those were
not real newspapers.

14:24.211 --> 14:26.430
- Yes, they were so!
- 'No, they weren't.'

14:26.517 --> 14:28.432
'Now, okay.
Alright, alright.'

14:28.519 --> 14:29.869
'Now I want you to read
from it.'

14:32.088 --> 14:33.873
- 'Come on. Read from it.'
- 'I'm reading it.'

14:33.960 --> 14:36.092
'Oh, ha ha. Out loud!
Go on!'

15:18.700 --> 15:20.267
Thanks. Let us know.

15:23.487 --> 15:26.621
The doctors say Tom Mitchell
had a major cardiac arrest.

15:26.708 --> 15:28.362
Hmm. I could have
told them that.

15:28.449 --> 15:31.017
They were able to stabilize him,
but he's still unconscious.

15:31.104 --> 15:33.367
They're gonna keep him
in ICU until he wakes up.

15:33.454 --> 15:35.760
Poor man.

15:35.847 --> 15:37.893
- Ooh.
- Went down and stayed down.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.460
Oh, yeah.

15:39.547 --> 15:41.592
Now, I've been looking
through Mitchell's notebooks.

15:41.679 --> 15:43.855
Aside from a whole bunch
of stuff about the dangers

15:43.943 --> 15:46.336

- What do you think?
- Merriman took a fall?

15:51.602 --> 15:54.344
Yeah, I can't see it.
It's worth killing over, though.

15:54.431 --> 15:56.825
A lot of money to be made
on a sure thing.

15:56.912 --> 15:58.783
We should talk
to the promoter Artash

15:58.870 --> 16:00.481
see what he has to say
about fight fixing.

16:02.309 --> 16:03.440
[indistinct chatter]

16:09.011 --> 16:10.099
Mr. Artash?

16:12.232 --> 16:14.016
Alright, 60-40 split.

16:14.103 --> 16:16.976
And an option
for his next three fights.

go eat a shoelace.

done by Friday.

16:23.634 --> 16:25.288

with the long hair?

16:36.865 --> 16:39.085
He's gonna be my next champion.
Mark my words.

16:39.172 --> 16:41.000
Fight fixing, what can you
tell us about it?

16:41.087 --> 16:42.827
No, that doesn't happen.

16:42.914 --> 16:47.049
The board finds out everyone
involved is done...forever.

16:47.136 --> 16:49.617
And you need a fighter
willing to take a dive.

16:49.704 --> 16:51.575
- Which Merriman isn't.
- No?

16:51.662 --> 16:53.403
Egotistical jerk like him?

16:53.490 --> 16:57.190
Come on!
Stick the jab and shoot it.

Stick and shoot!

17:01.977 --> 17:03.718
Get off the ropes!

17:06.199 --> 17:07.765
Your fighter looks bigger
and stronger.

17:07.852 --> 17:09.941
- Shouldn't he be winning?
- Well, he's slower and dumber.

17:16.470 --> 17:17.558
You're Floyd Benton,
aren't you?

17:17.645 --> 17:19.125
Didn't you train
Manny Flaco?

17:19.212 --> 17:21.040
Used to, until he got
too big and smart to learn.

17:22.563 --> 17:24.478
Come on, son of a bitch.
Stick it! Move! Come on!

17:26.871 --> 17:31.311
- Ah. Police officer.
- How'd you know?

17:31.398 --> 17:33.095
Police and fine women
always think they got a right

17:33.182 --> 17:35.880
to be wherever they're at,
and you ain't no fine woman.

17:38.318 --> 17:40.407
I'm here
about Charlotte Mitchell.

17:40.494 --> 17:41.930
Yeah. Poor girl.

17:43.453 --> 17:45.542
You think it was
about the fight?

17:45.629 --> 17:47.109
What do you think?

17:47.196 --> 17:48.589
I think if it wasn't
about the fight

17:48.676 --> 17:50.286
you wouldn't even
be here.

17:50.373 --> 17:53.507
What aspect of the fight do you
think would motivate murder?

17:55.291 --> 17:58.207
[chuckling]
You're the detective.

17:58.294 --> 17:59.600
What, am I supposed to do
your job for you?

18:01.863 --> 18:03.299
What if I do your job
for you?

18:03.386 --> 18:05.388
Is that a fair exchange?

18:05.475 --> 18:08.696
- Shoot.
- Artash's prospect has a tell.

18:08.783 --> 18:11.568
He taps his forehead before
he throws a right uppercut.

18:11.655 --> 18:13.135
When he does that,
your guy

18:13.222 --> 18:14.702
should step to the right
and throw a hook.

18:18.271 --> 18:19.489
Huh.

18:19.576 --> 18:21.143
Damn, if you
ain't almost correct.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.146
You got a good eye.

18:24.233 --> 18:26.017
Well, thank you.
Now it's your turn.

18:27.280 --> 18:30.065
Charlotte Mitchell...who
killed her?

18:30.152 --> 18:32.981
Don't know.
But I will say this.

18:33.068 --> 18:35.201
There's more to Manny Flaco
than meets the eye.

18:36.637 --> 18:39.118
Oh, and what's that?

18:39.205 --> 18:40.771
Just a vibe I get.

18:40.858 --> 18:42.904
Does that vibe have
anything to do with the fact

18:42.991 --> 18:44.210
that he fired you
as his trainer?

18:47.604 --> 18:49.128
I'm a bigger man than that.

18:50.955 --> 18:52.740
Okay, listen up. Come here.
Come here, come here, come here.

18:54.437 --> 18:55.743
Listen, the man there..

19:01.357 --> 19:03.577
There she is
Joe Reyes' old girlfriend.

19:03.664 --> 19:06.928
Keep on going, alright.
Come on now. Keep movin'.

19:08.756 --> 19:10.540
- We need to talk.
- What's this about?

19:10.627 --> 19:12.455
You remember a guy
named Joe Reyes?

19:12.542 --> 19:14.936
We need to know what happened
to a gun he gave you.

19:15.023 --> 19:16.459
Could you guys keep it down?

19:16.546 --> 19:17.852
People around here
might get upset

19:17.939 --> 19:19.245
if they knew about
my past business.

19:19.332 --> 19:21.638
The gun...what'd you do with it?

19:21.725 --> 19:23.379
I gave it
to my cousin Bobby.

19:23.466 --> 19:24.685
I-I don't know
what he did with it.

19:24.772 --> 19:26.382
Where's your cousin Bobby?

19:26.469 --> 19:28.602
Dead. Got blown up in Iraq.

19:28.689 --> 19:30.430
[cell phone ringing]
Excuse me.

19:30.517 --> 19:31.735
What's it's all about?

19:31.822 --> 19:34.434
- Hello?
- 'Am I in trouble?'

19:34.521 --> 19:37.698
Agent Rigsby,
this is J.J. LaRoche.

19:37.785 --> 19:39.961
Where are you?
We need to talk more.

19:40.048 --> 19:42.529
- I'm working a case.
- 'When are you coming back in?'

19:42.616 --> 19:44.357
Well, I couldn't say.
It's an active case.

19:44.444 --> 19:46.620
I could ask Agent Lisbon
to bring you back.

19:46.707 --> 19:48.012
'Should I do that?'

19:49.405 --> 19:50.711
I'll be there in an hour.

19:55.237 --> 19:57.326
Two kids I'm trying
to raise right who don't know

19:57.413 --> 19:58.762
the kind of life
I used to lead.

19:58.849 --> 19:59.807
Ma'am, we won't speak
to your children

19:59.894 --> 20:00.982
about this
unless we need to.

20:01.069 --> 20:02.157
- You ready?
- Yeah.

20:02.244 --> 20:03.593
Thank you, ma'am.
We'll be in touch.

20:03.680 --> 20:04.594
Thank you.

20:07.467 --> 20:08.729
Says she was at
a parent teacher conference

20:08.816 --> 20:09.773
the night before last.

20:09.860 --> 20:10.992
Should be easy to check.

20:12.776 --> 20:14.735
Anything wrong?
Who called?

20:14.822 --> 20:16.084
Nothing. Nobody.

20:20.697 --> 20:23.222
You said there had been
no contact.

20:23.309 --> 20:26.660
But phone records show
six phone calls from your father

20:26.747 --> 20:28.227
between June and July
of 2008.

20:29.924 --> 20:31.230
What does this have to do
with someone burning

20:31.317 --> 20:33.406
a cop killer to death
here in CBI?

20:33.493 --> 20:35.451
Nothing...directly.

20:35.538 --> 20:37.584
But it does speak
to character.

20:37.671 --> 20:38.672
You're questioning
my character?

20:40.326 --> 20:43.677
Did you know there are
criminological studies

20:43.764 --> 20:48.377
that posit criminality
as a heritable trait?

20:48.464 --> 20:50.945
Like eye color
or a baritone voice.

20:51.032 --> 20:52.686
Wh-what?

20:52.773 --> 20:57.430
I just mean, it may not be
your fault, Agent Rigsby.

20:57.517 --> 21:02.130
You may simply be predisposed
to criminal behavior..

21:02.217 --> 21:03.697
...scientifically speaking.

21:03.784 --> 21:05.394
Look, my father called me

21:05.481 --> 21:07.266
about a mix-up
with his parole officer.

21:07.353 --> 21:08.919
Was I supposed to ignore him?
Hang up?

21:09.006 --> 21:11.226
And did you forget
that conversation

21:11.313 --> 21:12.706
or you just chose
not to speak of it?

21:12.793 --> 21:14.055
I forgot.

21:16.971 --> 21:19.408
Are we done here?
I think we're done.

21:29.940 --> 21:32.552
[knocking]
Hey. I got something.

21:32.639 --> 21:34.075
A security guard had a run-in

21:34.162 --> 21:35.729
with Charlotte Mitchell
before the fight.

21:35.816 --> 21:37.644
She was trying to get
into the dressing room area.

21:37.731 --> 21:39.733
Didn't have the right
kind of access laminate

21:39.820 --> 21:40.995
so he wouldn't let her in.

21:41.082 --> 21:42.736
She got agitated,
made a scene

21:42.823 --> 21:45.521
and he threw her out.
This was at approximately 6:30.

21:45.608 --> 21:46.740
6:30?

21:46.827 --> 21:48.132
And that puts her
in the arena an hour

21:48.219 --> 21:49.656
before the ME's estimate.

21:49.743 --> 21:51.875
Yep, and that means
Flaco and Merriman

21:51.962 --> 21:53.703
both had opportunity.
They're suspects, too.

21:53.790 --> 21:55.705
Bring 'em both in. See what they
have to say under questioning.

21:55.792 --> 21:56.750
Okay.

22:03.844 --> 22:05.541
[dramatic music]

22:05.628 --> 22:08.457
Mr. Merriman, your associates
are gonna have to wait outside.

22:08.544 --> 22:09.937
- Oh, they're cool.
- They're cool outside.

22:12.069 --> 22:14.463
Hey, Flaco, you little punk,
you used plaster wraps,

22:14.550 --> 22:17.727
didn't you? I know a little punk
like you don't hit that hard.

22:17.814 --> 22:19.599
Mr. and Mrs. Flaco,
why don't we talk in my office?

22:19.686 --> 22:21.035
Come on, babe.

22:21.122 --> 22:22.558
Oh, now you running
away, Manny?

22:22.645 --> 22:24.865
Just like you did
in the cage, huh?

22:24.952 --> 22:27.258
Two million people saw me
kick your butt. Live with it.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.870
Oh, hell, no. Come on.

22:29.957 --> 22:31.350
Control yourselves,
both of you.

22:31.437 --> 22:32.916
Look, either of you try
anything,

22:33.003 --> 22:35.484
and I'm gonna put you in cuffs.
So let's just calm down.

22:35.571 --> 22:41.447
and get back
to business.

22:41.534 --> 22:43.449
I think you like,
getting beaten up.

22:43.536 --> 22:46.713
A little masochistic
streak there, huh?

22:46.800 --> 22:47.888
[indistinct shouting]

22:47.975 --> 22:49.280
Thanks for that.
Thanks.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.544
Break it up, guys!
That is enough!

22:51.631 --> 22:53.763

is going on here?

23:05.775 --> 23:06.994
Do you people even know.
What you're doing?

23:07.081 --> 23:07.821
- Can we sit down, Mr. Lima.
- No!

23:07.908 --> 23:09.388
Not until you tell me

23:09.475 --> 23:11.128
why you're set Manny
up to get jumped.

23:11.215 --> 23:13.217
Mr. Lima, how we conduct
interviews is not your concern.

23:13.304 --> 23:15.263
It is if
it endangers my fighter.

23:15.350 --> 23:16.395
Manny shouldn't have
been called in here

23:16.482 --> 23:17.613
anyway he's grieving
for Charlotte.

23:17.700 --> 23:18.875
We just need to ask
him a few questions.

23:18.962 --> 23:20.660
Now, please,
take a seat.

23:20.747 --> 23:22.444
Why? I mean, you got,
the man you want already.

23:22.531 --> 23:23.489
You mean
Rowdy Merriman?

23:23.576 --> 23:24.925
You saw him.
He doesn't like it

23:25.012 --> 23:26.361
when he doesn't get
what he wants.

23:26.448 --> 23:28.189
and he didn't get what
he wanted from Charlotte.

23:28.276 --> 23:32.759
- And what didhe want?
- Guess.

23:32.846 --> 23:35.718
Nah, I didn't kill
the writer lady. Why would I?

23:35.805 --> 23:37.372
I've looked at
your rap sheet.

23:37.459 --> 23:39.113
There's a history
of violence against women.

23:39.200 --> 23:42.856
Pfft. Man, if I slap a bitch,
It's 'cause she asked for it.

23:42.943 --> 23:44.684
Bitches like to get slapped.
Don't ask me why.

23:44.771 --> 23:46.468
Did, Charlotte Mitchell,
ask for it?

23:46.555 --> 23:47.861
No, she didn't.

23:47.948 --> 23:50.472
But I askedher
though, you know? Huh.

23:50.559 --> 23:51.952
You know,
she was like,"ew!"

23:52.039 --> 23:54.084
You know,
I disgusted her, man.

23:54.171 --> 23:55.782
Nice, clean, college lady.

23:55.869 --> 23:58.219
She rejected you.
How'd that make you feel?

23:58.306 --> 24:00.308
Like, I had to call another
bitch, to break me off a piece.

24:00.395 --> 24:02.658
which I did.

24:02.745 --> 24:04.834
And she was researching,
you and Flaco.

24:04.921 --> 24:05.922
Maybe she found out,
something about you

24:06.009 --> 24:07.228
you didn't want
anybody to know.

24:07.315 --> 24:09.883

I got nothin' to hide.

24:18.326 --> 24:19.980
Flaco, what's
he got to hide?

24:20.067 --> 24:22.286
I mean, he was knocking boots
with that writer lady, for one.

24:22.373 --> 24:24.158
Doggin' on that nasty,
little wife of his.

24:24.245 --> 24:25.246
You have proof of that?

24:25.333 --> 24:27.466
Proof, man.
Ask the punk, dude.

during your interview?

24:44.352 --> 24:46.310
Normally, we do this alone.

24:46.397 --> 24:49.009
I need her here.
I got no secrets from, Bea.

24:49.096 --> 24:52.229
Okay, what was your relationship
with Charlotte Mitchell?

24:52.316 --> 24:55.145
She was writing a book about me
and Rowdy, about the fight.

24:55.232 --> 24:56.625
Which started when?

24:56.712 --> 24:58.584
Since I started
training for the fight

24:58.671 --> 25:00.455
Six months ago.

25:00.542 --> 25:02.718
And how about when,
you weren't training?

25:02.805 --> 25:04.198
What does that mean?

25:04.285 --> 25:05.591
Don't act dumb, Manny.
She wants to know

25:05.678 --> 25:06.592
if you were
sleeping with her.

25:06.679 --> 25:08.071
What?No.

25:08.158 --> 25:09.943
Look at me when
you say that.

25:10.030 --> 25:11.727
Honey, I wasn't
sleeping with her.

25:11.814 --> 25:14.600
Honey? huh, please.

25:14.687 --> 25:16.689
So he's sleeping
with her. So what?

- No. I don't wanna hear it now.

and killed the lady.

- Not here.

You want to talk
to Floyd Benton.

about how he dopes

26:14.485 --> 26:16.096

at his gym.

Manny, out of there.

of the Flaco, Merriman fight?

At the fight. I had to buy
a ticket. You believe that?

26:24.147 --> 26:26.323
Charlotte Mitchell,
asked you about steroid use

26:26.410 --> 26:28.412
at your gym, correct?

26:28.499 --> 26:30.197
Beatriz Flaco.

26:30.284 --> 26:33.722
She hasn't liked me, since she
was a little girl, in pigtails.

26:33.809 --> 26:35.724
What's Beatriz Flaco
got to do with this?

26:35.811 --> 26:37.204
She told you that crap.

26:37.291 --> 26:39.075
We heard from
numerous sources

26:39.162 --> 26:40.860
that Flaco, fired
you as his trainer

26:40.947 --> 26:42.601
because you were
pushing steroids on him.

26:42.688 --> 26:44.472
No onewas pushed
to do anything.

26:44.559 --> 26:46.517
But there was,
steroid abuse

26:46.605 --> 26:48.302
and Charlotte found
out about it, right?

26:48.389 --> 26:51.392
Big scoop.
Athletes get juiced.

26:51.479 --> 26:53.176

So arrest me.
I won't resist.

than abuse steroids.

she told you, she gave that gun

28:18.087 --> 28:19.872
to her cousin Bobby,
who passed.

28:19.959 --> 28:22.918
That's right. We can't
track the gun past him.

28:23.005 --> 28:25.225
Yeah, well, it's not
true, what she said.

28:25.312 --> 28:28.184
She didn't gave that gun
to Bobby, god rest his soul.

28:28.271 --> 28:29.751
She just said that
because Bobby's dead

28:29.838 --> 28:31.318

you know?

30:33.309 --> 30:34.702
wanted to know if there
was anybody else there

30:34.789 --> 30:38.575
you know, who could
verify it, and... I said you.

30:40.055 --> 30:41.013
What?

of my mouth.

taken it back, I would've.

checked back with you

'But we had a dream, and
today that dream is a reality.'

31:58.568 --> 32:00.962
'God bless America.'

32:01.049 --> 32:02.485
Anything on Mitchell's notes?

32:02.572 --> 32:04.139
Not a thing.

32:04.226 --> 32:06.620
Manny Flaco, is challenging
for the middleweight crown.

32:06.707 --> 32:08.274
Len Artash,
just announced it.

32:08.361 --> 32:10.145
- What are you doing?
- Going to talk, to Len Artash.

32:10.232 --> 32:11.842
Aren't you coming?

32:14.454 --> 32:16.673
[Len Artash]
'Pull the guard!'

32:16.760 --> 32:20.547
- Reverse, reverse, reverse.
- Watch the guillotine!

32:20.634 --> 32:22.027
Artash, got some
questions for you.

32:22.114 --> 32:24.594
- You were born in America, yes?
- That's right.

32:24.681 --> 32:27.902
- And your parents are Armenian.
- Yes. Why?

32:27.989 --> 32:30.905
- What was your father's name?
- Arik Artashian.

32:30.992 --> 32:33.081
- What's your father's name?
- Floyd.

32:33.168 --> 32:35.344
Uh-huh. And your mother?

32:35.431 --> 32:37.477
Nancy.
What is this about?

32:37.564 --> 32:40.219
Nancy, doesn't sound,
like an Armenian name.

32:40.306 --> 32:42.134
No, it's not. It's what
she called herself

32:42.221 --> 32:43.613
when she got
here to America.

32:43.700 --> 32:45.485
[Jane]
What was she christened?

32:45.572 --> 32:47.182
Nargiz.
And do you have--

32:47.269 --> 32:51.230
Nargiz. I bet that means
something beautiful.

32:51.317 --> 32:52.666
It's a flower.

32:52.753 --> 32:55.799
Either of you
recognize this?

32:55.886 --> 32:57.323
No, what is it?

32:57.410 --> 32:58.802
It's Charlotte Mitchell's
notebook.

32:58.889 --> 33:02.763
You know what that says?

33:02.850 --> 33:04.373
What about you?

33:04.460 --> 33:05.984
No. What do
you think it is?

33:06.071 --> 33:10.162
I don't know. Some kind
of coded shorthand, most likely.

33:10.249 --> 33:14.122
Doesn't matter. Uh, I'll bet
her father knows what it says.

33:14.209 --> 33:15.123
Doctors said that,
Thomas Mitchell

33:15.210 --> 33:17.169
has taken a turn for the better.

33:17.256 --> 33:18.170
Uh, expected to regain
consciousness

33:18.257 --> 33:19.214
in 12 to 24 hours, right?

33:19.301 --> 33:20.824
Right.

33:20.911 --> 33:23.479
So there we have it.
Thomas Mitchell will tell us

33:23.566 --> 33:25.525
what this says, and then,
I'll bet we will find out

33:25.612 --> 33:30.573
what Charlotte, learned
that got her killed.

33:30.660 --> 33:32.053
I went through
that entire notebook.

33:32.140 --> 33:33.620
There wasn't
any shorthand in it.

33:33.707 --> 33:36.927
Really? How weird.
Wonder where it came from.

33:41.584 --> 33:44.587
[instrumental music]

33:50.245 --> 33:53.422
You served in the military,
didn't you, Agent Cho?

33:55.946 --> 33:57.948
Yes.

33:58.036 --> 34:00.386
Rangers?

34:00.473 --> 34:01.648
Special forces.

34:01.735 --> 34:03.650
Ah. Hmm.

34:03.737 --> 34:07.567
So... you understand
the concept of honor.

34:12.398 --> 34:15.836
That's an affidavit
that Wayne Rigsby signed

34:15.923 --> 34:18.752
saying that you and he,
spent an afternoon

34:18.839 --> 34:21.624
with his criminal father.

34:21.711 --> 34:24.410
You remember that day,
Agent Cho?

34:30.981 --> 34:33.288
Agent Rigsby
initially claimed

34:33.375 --> 34:36.248
to have no contact
with his father

34:36.335 --> 34:41.079
then became evasive when
confronted with his falsehood.

34:44.865 --> 34:49.217
Looking into it,
I... discovered that

34:49.304 --> 34:55.180
Wayne provided an alibi that
kept his father out of jail..

34:55.267 --> 34:57.747
...and you were part
of that alibi.

35:01.142 --> 35:03.536
So..

35:03.623 --> 35:07.496
...I just need you to confirm..

35:08.541 --> 35:10.325
[papers rustling]

35:10.412 --> 35:12.806
...on your honor..

35:12.893 --> 35:15.635
...that you
were indeed there that day.

35:18.246 --> 35:20.553
Yes, I was.

35:20.640 --> 35:23.773
I was there with,
agent Rigsby, and his father.

35:23.860 --> 35:25.732
Okay.

35:25.819 --> 35:27.560
Good.

35:35.263 --> 35:38.962
What did you do that afternoon,
the three of you?

35:40.138 --> 35:41.661
Give me some details.

35:43.445 --> 35:45.578
[folder sliding]

35:45.665 --> 35:47.710
I don't recall.

35:51.497 --> 35:53.760
Nothing at all?

35:53.847 --> 35:55.370
Strange.

35:55.457 --> 35:57.459
I was there.

35:57.546 --> 35:59.809
I'll swear to it.

35:59.896 --> 36:01.768
You need me to sign,
something to make it official?

36:03.770 --> 36:06.033
No.

36:06.120 --> 36:08.035
That won't be necessary.

36:15.738 --> 36:19.046
That'll be all.
Thank you, agent.

36:30.318 --> 36:32.407
I told him I was with you.

36:32.494 --> 36:34.583
Alright, let's go.
We've gotta get to the hospital.

36:34.670 --> 36:38.239
Jane and Van Pelt are
already there. You guys okay?

36:38.326 --> 36:40.850
Let's go.
I'll explain on the way.

36:46.552 --> 36:48.815
All clear in Mitchell's room.

36:51.731 --> 36:53.559
Hallway's clear.

36:53.646 --> 36:55.517
All clear here.

36:58.128 --> 37:01.044
Wait a minute.

37:01.131 --> 37:05.571
I think I saw Reyes.
He's headed your way.

37:12.969 --> 37:15.755
I see him.
Cho, cut him off.

37:21.151 --> 37:22.501
Mr. Reyes..

37:22.588 --> 37:23.980
What are you doing here?

37:24.067 --> 37:25.678
Um, I was just coming
to pay my respects.

37:25.765 --> 37:27.332
No, you can't be here.
We have to leave now.

37:27.419 --> 37:29.116
Wait. I didn't mean anything.
What are you doing?

37:29.203 --> 37:34.382
Don't argue, Mr. Reyes.
Right this way. Come on.

37:34.469 --> 37:37.342
[intense music]

38:08.373 --> 38:11.550
Mr. Lima, put your hands on
your head where I can see 'em.

38:11.637 --> 38:14.248
Mr. Mitchell, left
the ICU yesterday

38:14.335 --> 38:15.858
but I'll be glad to pass on
your best wishes.

38:15.945 --> 38:18.905
Whatever. You got nothing.

38:18.992 --> 38:20.994
That notebook shorthand
crap, won't fly in court.

38:21.081 --> 38:23.605
True enough.
I happened to write

38:23.692 --> 38:26.347
that notebook
shorthand crap myself.

38:26.434 --> 38:29.437
Charlotte Mitchell, was murdered
because she discovered a secret.

38:29.524 --> 38:31.874
I simply had to convince
the killer that the secret

38:31.961 --> 38:34.268
didn't die with her.
Et voila.

38:34.355 --> 38:36.705
And this should
fly nicely in court.

38:36.792 --> 38:38.098
- You got it all wrong--
- Save it.

38:38.185 --> 38:39.926
This is the gun,
that was used

38:40.013 --> 38:41.580
to shoot
Charlotte Mitchell

38:41.667 --> 38:44.104
and you're the one
who killed her.

38:46.149 --> 38:48.674
Mm-hmm-hmm.

38:48.761 --> 38:52.373
You can have
these back now, Mr. Mitchell.

38:52.460 --> 38:54.462
I, uh...I'm sorry.

38:54.549 --> 38:56.072
But I-I scribbled,
in one of those.

38:56.159 --> 38:57.726
That's, uh, how we caught

38:57.813 --> 38:59.075
the man that shot
your daughter.

38:59.162 --> 39:00.294
I hope you don't mind.

39:00.381 --> 39:02.296
No, no. That's, uh..

39:03.558 --> 39:06.431
So...um, it's over?

39:07.519 --> 39:09.651
Y-you've solved the case?

39:09.738 --> 39:12.262
Yes. Now we're just
tying up some loose ends.

39:17.877 --> 39:22.185
Never, never would've figured,
Suge Lima, as a murderer.

39:22.272 --> 39:25.188
Yeah, that's terrible.
Shocking.

39:25.275 --> 39:26.581
Yes, it is.

39:26.668 --> 39:30.237
What for?
Why'd he do it?

39:30.324 --> 39:33.109
So, uh, is there
anything I can do to help?

39:33.196 --> 39:34.720
[Jane]
'There is, actually.'

39:34.807 --> 39:37.200
Your mother's name,
the, uh, the flower?

39:37.287 --> 39:38.680
Yes. Nargiz.

39:38.767 --> 39:42.597
Nargiz, which means...narcissus

39:42.684 --> 39:45.078
same name as your club,
named it after your mom.

39:45.165 --> 39:46.862
Yeah.

39:46.949 --> 39:51.389
Club Narcissus where
Frank Lopez lost Joe Reyes' gun.

39:51.476 --> 39:52.955
Yeah, the one he got
from Dawn May.

39:53.042 --> 39:54.479
That one.

39:54.566 --> 39:56.176
Who?What?

39:56.263 --> 39:59.222
You don't know the guys, but we
know how you got the gun

39:59.309 --> 40:00.441
that Lima used to kill
Charlotte Mitchell

40:00.528 --> 40:02.878
and you're under arrest.
Stand up.

40:02.965 --> 40:05.315
The only thing we don't know,
is why you had to kill her.

40:05.403 --> 40:08.014
And that's what
we're gonna find out.

40:10.930 --> 40:13.889
Mr. Flaco, do you remember
around a year ago

40:13.976 --> 40:15.674
giving blood to be tested?

40:15.761 --> 40:17.327
Sure. Results came back

40:17.415 --> 40:20.896
said I was as healthy as
a horse. Suge told me.

40:20.983 --> 40:23.377
Suge lied.

40:23.464 --> 40:25.553
He and Artash,
submitted the samples

40:25.640 --> 40:28.991
under Suge's name, instead
of yours just in case.

40:29.078 --> 40:30.950
Markers showed
a high level of protein

40:31.037 --> 40:34.736
that indicates cranial bleeding
and spinal leakage.

40:34.823 --> 40:37.739
Oh, my god.

40:37.826 --> 40:40.916
[Lisbon]
'Charlotte Mitchell
figured out the switch.'

40:43.832 --> 40:46.052
I know that blood sample
was Manny's not Lima's.

40:46.139 --> 40:48.184
If Manny gets in that cage,
he could die.

40:48.271 --> 40:50.665
What the hell are
you talking about, lady?

40:50.752 --> 40:53.015
And how'd you get, your hands
on those tests?

40:53.102 --> 40:55.627
Stop the fight, Len, or else..

40:55.714 --> 41:00.109
Alright, alright.
I'll stop the fight. Calm down.

41:00.196 --> 41:01.459
[phone beeping]

41:03.199 --> 41:05.071
We got a problem.

41:08.901 --> 41:11.512
Those sons of bitches.

41:11.599 --> 41:13.340
They risked Manny's life.

41:13.427 --> 41:16.822
No MMA authority would let him
in the cage if word got out.

41:22.697 --> 41:24.917
It'sonedoctor's opinion.
He looks fine to me.

41:25.004 --> 41:27.180
Do you really think
you'll get away with this?

41:27.267 --> 41:30.879
I will tell everyone.

41:30.966 --> 41:36.276
Let go of me.

41:36.363 --> 41:38.278
[gunshot]

41:42.456 --> 41:45.285
[dramatic music]

41:52.466 --> 41:54.947
It's gonna be fine, baby.

41:55.034 --> 41:56.514
We're gonna make
it through this.

41:56.601 --> 42:00.387
[elevator door closing]

42:00.474 --> 42:02.607
You gotta feel for the guy,
He lost his livelihood.

42:02.694 --> 42:04.260
Meh. Lost a life of
getting hit in the head

42:04.347 --> 42:07.176
but he got his marriage back.
Seems like a fair trade to me.

42:07.263 --> 42:08.787
Aren't you the romantic.

42:08.874 --> 42:12.312
Makes the world go round.

42:12.399 --> 42:15.620
[telephone ringing]

42:17.665 --> 42:19.101
Hey. Cho..

42:20.015 --> 42:21.626
...thank you.

42:36.815 --> 42:39.687
[Jane]
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.
