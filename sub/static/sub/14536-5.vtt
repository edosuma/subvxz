00:01.893 --> 00:03.644
<i>Previously...</i>

00:03.679 --> 00:04.936
I didn't get to properly
introduce myself before.

00:04.971 --> 00:08.915
I'm KC Cooper,
and I'm your cousin.

00:08.950 --> 00:11.100
I'm actually looking at
my mother's face.

00:11.136 --> 00:14.613
- Abby, she's alive.
- What?

00:14.648 --> 00:16.431
She's alive, and I know
where she is.

00:16.467 --> 00:18.566
Hello, Abby.

00:18.602 --> 00:19.676
I'd know my baby anywhere.

00:19.712 --> 00:23.572
Actually... I'm KC.

00:23.607 --> 00:25.548
That's Abby.

00:25.583 --> 00:27.016
Hello.

00:27.052 --> 00:31.020
We did good, Mom. You did good.

00:31.056 --> 00:32.948
So what are you
really doing here?

00:32.983 --> 00:35.317
- Carrying out my mission.
- Which is?

00:35.352 --> 00:37.544
Win KC's trust so she
can convince Kira

00:37.579 --> 00:39.738
to bring me to you.

00:44.436 --> 00:46.044
All right, everyone,
Cooper family meeting.

00:46.079 --> 00:48.797
We need to discuss
our little problem.

00:48.832 --> 00:51.024
If you ask me, our problem is

00:51.059 --> 00:52.626
all these
Cooper family meetings.

00:52.661 --> 00:54.761
Look, it's not the meetings
that's a problem for me.

00:54.796 --> 00:56.305
It's the lack of snacks.

00:56.340 --> 00:59.099
Would it really kill somebody
to put out a crudit?

00:59.101 --> 01:02.811
I'm talking about how you
two told Abby we're spies.

01:02.846 --> 01:05.221
Honey, we had no choice.

01:05.257 --> 01:06.848
Sweetheart, we are
secret agents,

01:06.883 --> 01:09.017
not blab-it-to-anyone-
who'll-listen agents.

01:09.053 --> 01:10.602
There's only one thing
we can do.

01:10.638 --> 01:13.822
All right, I'll eliminate Abby.

01:13.857 --> 01:16.892
I meant memory spray.

01:16.927 --> 01:17.642
I guess that's
another way to go.

01:17.677 --> 01:19.236
Softies.

01:21.465 --> 01:23.348
Dad, no.

01:23.383 --> 01:25.609
The whole point of sneaking
Abby to Anguilla

01:25.644 --> 01:27.302
was for her to meet her mother.

01:27.338 --> 01:29.505
If we're looking
to get rid of memories,

01:29.507 --> 01:30.855
I vote for the time that
Ernie got out of the pool

01:30.890 --> 01:33.533
but his bathing suit didn't.

01:33.569 --> 01:36.052
I know I'm still
trying to forget about it.

01:36.087 --> 01:38.313
Craig, look, it's fine.

01:38.349 --> 01:40.073
I mean, no one else knows
that Erica's alive.

01:40.108 --> 01:41.674
She's still hiding out
in Anguilla.

01:41.710 --> 01:44.010
I don't know
if we can trust that.

01:44.045 --> 01:46.085
- But she's family.
- But she's so pretty.

01:48.950 --> 01:51.560
Family. I meant family.

01:54.256 --> 01:55.905
Craig, the Organization
check and everything

01:55.940 --> 01:57.991
Abby told us was true.

01:58.026 --> 01:59.926
No. We can't take the chance.

01:59.961 --> 02:01.628
I've made a decision.
We're memory spraying her.

02:01.663 --> 02:03.371
( Knocking on door )

02:03.406 --> 02:07.108
Hi! I brought cookies.

02:07.144 --> 02:09.102
Because I wasn't sure
what a thank you for

02:09.137 --> 02:11.671
reuniting me with my
supposed-to-be-dead mom gift is.

02:11.706 --> 02:13.982
Plus, I had cookie mix.

02:14.017 --> 02:15.642
We're happy we could help.

02:15.677 --> 02:18.345
Right, Dad?

02:18.347 --> 02:20.880
Meeting my mom was
the greatest moment of my life.

02:20.915 --> 02:22.824
- One I'll never forget.
- Hear that, Dad?

02:22.860 --> 02:25.368
She'll never forget.

02:25.403 --> 02:26.911
And I owe it all
to my new family.

02:26.947 --> 02:28.180
Family.

02:31.869 --> 02:33.793
Abby, look at me.

02:33.829 --> 02:36.196
I'm sorry, but...

02:36.232 --> 02:40.041
You're not gonna say anything about
what we do for a living, are you?

02:40.077 --> 02:41.837
I don't know
what you're talking about.

02:44.305 --> 02:46.072
Softies.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.668
See, you guys, look.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.545
No one will ever know.

02:51.580 --> 02:54.847
Come on, give me those cookies.

02:54.883 --> 02:59.085
All right, we need
some plates, glasses.

03:03.058 --> 03:05.725
So Erica King is alive
and in Anguilla.

03:05.760 --> 03:08.645
Send in a field team.

03:08.647 --> 03:11.873
It's time we finally
brought that evil woman in.

03:11.908 --> 03:15.251
¶ Oh, when danger
comes for you ¶

03:15.286 --> 03:18.447
¶ You know
I'll stand beside you ¶

03:18.449 --> 03:21.366
¶ 'Cause ain't nobody
keep things hustle cool ¶

03:21.401 --> 03:26.462
¶ I'll always find a way,
a way out of the fire ¶

03:26.498 --> 03:30.166
¶ Don't tell nobody,
tell nobody ¶

03:30.201 --> 03:32.218
¶ I'm not perfect ¶

03:32.254 --> 03:36.289
¶ So many things
I wanna tell you ¶

03:36.324 --> 03:40.184
¶ But I, I, I,
I keep it undercover ¶

03:40.220 --> 03:42.253
¶ Livin' my life,
no way to learn ¶

03:42.288 --> 03:44.531
¶ Doin' my thing,
gonna make it work ¶

03:44.566 --> 03:46.966
¶ Know I'm the realest,
baby, I'm fearless ¶

03:47.002 --> 03:49.077
¶ But I always got your back ¶

03:49.112 --> 03:50.963
¶ Nobody can do it like I can ¶

03:50.998 --> 03:53.248
¶ I gotta find out who I am ¶

03:53.283 --> 03:55.884
¶ Ain't got to worry about me ¶

03:55.919 --> 03:56.985
¶ It's all part of the plan ¶

03:57.020 --> 03:59.387
I keep it undercover.

03:59.422 --> 04:01.022
I keep it undercover.

04:05.579 --> 04:08.614
Hey. What are you guys
doing out here?

04:08.649 --> 04:10.290
We need to talk.

04:10.292 --> 04:13.435
Is this an intervention
about my hands-free purse

04:13.470 --> 04:15.344
We have been through
this 100 times.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.480
It is not a hands-free purse.

04:17.515 --> 04:19.508
It is a fanny pack.
Say it with me.

04:19.543 --> 04:23.611
BOTH: If your purse has Velcro,
it is not in style.

04:23.647 --> 04:26.707
Thank you.

04:26.742 --> 04:28.809
But that's not what
this is about.

04:28.844 --> 04:30.568
We heard you have
a date with Darien.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.371
Yeah, you heard that from me,

04:33.407 --> 04:35.757
because I told you.

04:35.792 --> 04:37.701
And it's your fourth date.

04:37.736 --> 04:38.660
Yeah, so?

04:38.695 --> 04:41.813
KC, KC, KC.

04:41.848 --> 04:43.214
Everybody knows
what the fourth date means.

04:43.249 --> 04:45.141
That we liked the first
three so much,

04:45.176 --> 04:47.477
we decided to do it again?

04:47.513 --> 04:50.505
KC, let me ask you something.
You like Darien, right?

04:50.540 --> 04:52.674
Yes, I do.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.534
I really, really do.

04:54.569 --> 04:56.594
Great. So let's say,
at the end of the date,

04:56.630 --> 04:59.498
he leans in close,
stares longingly into your eyes

04:59.533 --> 05:02.834
with his lips so close, you could feel
his warm breath against your face.

05:02.869 --> 05:04.911
What do you do?

05:04.946 --> 05:08.364
Hope he didn't eat garlic?

05:08.400 --> 05:10.466
Wrong. You kiss him.

05:10.502 --> 05:11.909
Unless you're not ready.

05:11.945 --> 05:13.578
Or he ate garlic.

05:13.613 --> 05:15.914
And even if he did,
you power through.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.549
I think what Marisa
is trying to say

05:17.584 --> 05:20.710
- is things seem to be progressing...
- So you should kiss him.

05:20.745 --> 05:22.428
- Only if you want to.
- If you're not ready...

05:22.464 --> 05:24.906
You should let him kiss you
right on the lips.

05:24.941 --> 05:28.618
Go for it! Kiss, kiss!

05:28.653 --> 05:31.104
Get a hold of yourself, okay?

05:31.139 --> 05:34.215
I'll do what I want when I want,

05:34.251 --> 05:35.859
and not until I am ready.

05:35.894 --> 05:38.144
Right. I'm sorry.

05:38.179 --> 05:39.746
So you think you're
gonna kiss him?

05:42.325 --> 05:45.251
Hey, Ernie, you remember
Colin Cleveland?

05:45.287 --> 05:47.311
Your friend,
the politician's son?

05:47.347 --> 05:49.122
The one who thinks
I'm the greatest thing

05:49.157 --> 05:52.008
since anti-microbial
shower shoes?

05:52.043 --> 05:54.886
I don't know why you insist
on bring up

05:54.922 --> 05:57.597
your funky, funky feet, but yes.

05:57.632 --> 06:01.059
Yes. He and his dad
are on their way over.

06:01.095 --> 06:02.769
You think you can entertain him

06:02.805 --> 06:03.862
while his dad and I catch up?

06:03.897 --> 06:05.455
I can spare some time...

06:05.490 --> 06:06.889
for a fan.

06:06.924 --> 06:09.333
Hold up.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.544
Just to be clear,
this boy admires you?

06:11.580 --> 06:13.140
This is an actual,
real-life kid and not

06:13.165 --> 06:14.931
a figment of your imagination?

06:14.967 --> 06:18.009
No! Not this time.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.661
( Knocking on door )

06:23.867 --> 06:25.917
Ah!

06:25.953 --> 06:27.793
BOTH: Kappa Kappa Delta forever!

06:28.505 --> 06:32.549
Remember that time we almost
joined that fraternity?

06:34.811 --> 06:36.536
Oh, Jackson, it's good
to see you, man.

06:36.572 --> 06:38.463
Ernie, Judy! Hey.

06:38.498 --> 06:40.173
Whoa!

06:40.208 --> 06:42.033
Did you hit a growth spurt?

06:42.068 --> 06:43.526
You're like a giant.

06:43.561 --> 06:45.711
A giant what? Pain in the butt?

06:45.747 --> 06:48.782
Nope. Same height.

06:48.817 --> 06:50.450
Just wearing some new orthotics.

06:50.485 --> 06:52.193
And you wear them well!

06:54.055 --> 06:55.580
Come on upstairs
and I'll show you

06:55.615 --> 06:57.615
how to power a light bulb
with a potato.

06:59.644 --> 07:03.279
So how are you doing,
Mr. Vice President?

07:03.314 --> 07:04.972
Please. I haven't won yet.

07:05.008 --> 07:06.950
The election isn't
for another week.

07:06.985 --> 07:11.913
And even if we are ahead by an
impossible-to-beat 12 points, don't jinx it.

07:11.948 --> 07:15.068
Who am I kidding? I'm gonna be the
vice-president of the United States!

07:19.572 --> 07:21.464
Seriously, I have a favor
to ask of you, Coop.

07:21.500 --> 07:25.126
I'm hoping you'll head up
my security team.

07:25.161 --> 07:26.452
I could use someone
I really trust.

07:26.488 --> 07:30.031
Wow, Jackson, I'm flattered.

07:30.066 --> 07:31.950
My commitment is to
the Organization.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.810
I'm not asking for
anything long-term.

07:33.845 --> 07:34.911
Just get me through
the election.

07:34.946 --> 07:36.479
Can I think about it?

07:36.514 --> 07:38.798
- Why not?
- Would I get a pair of

07:38.834 --> 07:40.025
those cool
Secret Service sunglasses?

07:40.060 --> 07:42.669
Why not?
- Can I fly Air Force One?

07:42.704 --> 07:44.454
Don't push it, Craig.

07:49.711 --> 07:52.019
I don't mean to brag,
but with this puppy,

07:52.055 --> 07:54.597
I can talk to people
as far away as Indonesia.

07:54.632 --> 07:57.300
So can I.
Ever heard of a cell phone?

07:59.045 --> 08:00.862
This is cooler.

08:00.897 --> 08:03.690
And you don't have to worry
about going over your data plan.

08:03.725 --> 08:05.900
Plus, I built it myself,

08:05.935 --> 08:07.694
with a few capacitors, a diode,

08:07.729 --> 08:09.487
and about ten feet
of electrical wire.

08:09.522 --> 08:12.757
Whoa! I am freaking out.

08:12.792 --> 08:14.712
You wanna see
some electrical wires?

08:16.212 --> 08:17.862
No one needs your help, Judy.

08:21.593 --> 08:24.802
I had a great time, even if
you did beat me at Skee Ball.

08:24.838 --> 08:28.148
Beat you? Excuse me,
I pummeled you.

08:28.183 --> 08:31.501
I guess you just can't
handle... how I roll.

08:33.814 --> 08:35.571
Hey, in my defense,

08:35.606 --> 08:37.031
I was distracted by
a beautiful girl.

08:37.067 --> 08:38.449
( Nervous chuckle )

08:38.485 --> 08:39.634
Thank you.

08:55.360 --> 08:56.480
Good night.

08:58.738 --> 09:02.181
All right. See you tomorrow.

09:02.217 --> 09:03.491
Well, I kissed him.

09:03.526 --> 09:04.843
Yay!

09:04.878 --> 09:07.629
Where did it happen?

09:07.631 --> 09:09.346
At the movies, at the restaurant?
On the porch?

09:09.382 --> 09:11.524
- On his eyeball.
- What?

09:11.559 --> 09:15.045
I kissed him on his eyeball.

09:15.080 --> 09:18.623
Ay yi eyeball.

09:18.658 --> 09:20.792
Marisa, I am such an idiot.

09:20.827 --> 09:23.068
What if he doesn't
like me anymore?

09:23.104 --> 09:24.437
KC, would you just relax?

09:24.472 --> 09:26.648
Darien likes you.
He isn't going anywhere.

09:26.683 --> 09:30.426
( Car tires screeching,
crashing sound )

09:30.461 --> 09:33.004
Quick, call an ambulance.

09:33.039 --> 09:35.199
A car just came out of
nowhere and hit Darien.

09:48.646 --> 09:50.772
I don't know if you can hear me,

09:50.807 --> 09:53.875
but I really need you
to get better.

09:56.446 --> 10:00.515
I really, really like you.

10:00.517 --> 10:04.143
I mean, my life can be
kind of stressful sometimes.

10:04.178 --> 10:05.862
More like all the time.

10:05.897 --> 10:11.234
But when I'm with you, I forget
about all of that, you know?

10:11.269 --> 10:13.303
You just let me be me.

10:13.338 --> 10:17.039
You know, just regular,
boring KC.

10:17.075 --> 10:21.436
I have no idea
why you like me so much,

10:21.471 --> 10:23.613
but I'm really glad that you do.

10:25.283 --> 10:28.701
Yes, I really, really
want you to be my boyfriend.

10:33.583 --> 10:36.334
Oh, I kissed you out of a coma!

10:38.855 --> 10:40.463
Actually, you kissed me
out of a nap.

10:40.498 --> 10:42.357
Oh.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.483
Okay, um...

10:44.519 --> 10:45.593
So you gonna be all right?

10:45.628 --> 10:48.246
Yeah. I just have a broken arm
and a slight concussion.

10:48.281 --> 10:50.815
They're gonna keep me another
day or so for observation.

10:50.850 --> 10:54.210
Okay. That's great.

10:54.245 --> 10:57.389
I'd hug you, but you
couldn't really hug me back.

10:57.424 --> 10:59.664
'Cause the arm, so... high five!

11:06.575 --> 11:09.375
So?

11:09.410 --> 11:11.485
What's exactly the plan here?

11:11.521 --> 11:12.895
We gonna pretend like
you didn't just say

11:12.930 --> 11:14.213
you wanted me
to be your boyfriend?

11:14.248 --> 11:16.883
Okay, did I say that,

11:16.918 --> 11:19.343
or did you dream that?

11:19.378 --> 11:21.478
No, I think you said it.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.531
No, I think you imagined it,

11:23.566 --> 11:25.166
because of the drugs
they gave you.

11:25.201 --> 11:27.502
You mean the antibiotics?

11:27.537 --> 11:30.255
Yes. Of course.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.865
Antibiotic hallucinations.

11:32.901 --> 11:34.567
It's 100% medically accurate,

11:34.602 --> 11:37.495
despite what your doctor
will tell you after I leave.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.514
Oh, okay.

11:39.549 --> 11:41.057
You should probably know.

11:41.092 --> 11:43.050
I wanna be your boyfriend.

11:43.086 --> 11:44.810
Really?

11:44.845 --> 11:46.362
Really.

11:46.397 --> 11:51.592
Are you sure that's not
just the antibiotics talking?

11:51.628 --> 11:52.610
I'm really glad you're okay.

11:52.645 --> 11:54.704
Me, too.

11:58.276 --> 12:00.267
All right, Colin,

12:00.303 --> 12:02.303
remember the water
we dyed red yesterday?

12:02.338 --> 12:04.797
I wish I died yesterday.

12:04.832 --> 12:08.617
Well, a stalk of celery has been
sitting in it overnight.

12:08.652 --> 12:10.720
Take a look at this. Voila.

12:13.258 --> 12:15.808
A sorcerer. You're a sorcerer!

12:15.843 --> 12:18.677
Actually, it's due to
capillary action.

12:18.713 --> 12:22.782
Which is the only action
Ernie will ever see.

12:22.817 --> 12:24.800
Just because you mumble

12:24.835 --> 12:26.795
doesn't mean I can't
hear you, Judy.

12:27.664 --> 12:29.947
You actually like this stuff?

12:29.983 --> 12:33.485
- Like it? I love it!
- Yeah!

12:33.520 --> 12:36.312
You don't have cable TV, do you?

12:36.348 --> 12:38.164
You should get it.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.788
All that manpower,

12:45.824 --> 12:47.665
and the search turned up
absolutely nothing.

12:47.700 --> 12:48.933
If Erica King isn't in Anguilla,

12:48.968 --> 12:50.048
where the heck is she?

13:14.744 --> 13:16.436
Hey, what's up, Abby?

13:16.471 --> 13:19.321
Thank you so much for stopping
by and checking on Darien,

13:19.357 --> 13:21.090
but good news, he is
gonna be perfectly fine.

13:21.125 --> 13:23.467
Well, this time he is.

13:23.502 --> 13:26.004
What you talking about?

13:26.039 --> 13:27.680
His accident.

13:27.715 --> 13:29.891
It wasn't an accident.

13:29.926 --> 13:33.744
I'm sorry,
that doesn't make any sense.

13:33.779 --> 13:36.464
Who would intentionally
hurt Darien?

13:36.499 --> 13:38.558
I would.

13:41.345 --> 13:43.696
Oh.

13:43.731 --> 13:44.221
You work for
the Other Side, don't you?

13:44.256 --> 13:45.915
Yeah.

13:45.950 --> 13:49.877
Oh, okay, so you've just been
playing me this whole time.

13:49.912 --> 13:52.012
Well, look at that.

13:52.047 --> 13:53.764
You're not just book smart.

13:53.799 --> 13:55.107
You can also point out
the obvious.

13:55.143 --> 13:59.762
Huh. I don't know why you
bothered bringing a laser gun.

13:59.798 --> 14:03.499
When you already
stabbed me in the back.

14:03.534 --> 14:04.884
Are you done?

14:04.919 --> 14:06.039
I forgot one more thing.

14:21.143 --> 14:22.983
I defended you to my parents.

14:25.515 --> 14:27.648
I trusted you.

14:30.145 --> 14:32.362
I listened to
your kissing advice.

14:32.397 --> 14:36.032
Did you, 'cause I never said anything
about making out with his eyeball.

14:38.486 --> 14:41.512
Get your butt back here.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.590
No one runs my boyfriend
over with a car

14:43.592 --> 14:45.383
and makes me spill
his overpriced commissary snacks

14:45.418 --> 14:47.585
and gets away with it.

14:52.692 --> 14:56.276
Hello, KC. Hope you don't
mind me dropping in.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.632
Let your Auntie Erica
give you a hug.

15:04.203 --> 15:06.846
Erica. So you're back
from Anguilla.

15:06.881 --> 15:09.315
She really does
state the obvious.

15:11.052 --> 15:15.246
Now unless you wanna end up
in a hospital bed or worse,

15:15.248 --> 15:17.448
you'd better listen to
what your auntie has to say.

15:26.101 --> 15:28.701
Isn't this lovely?

15:28.736 --> 15:30.694
So happy to see you, sis.

15:30.729 --> 15:33.014
Surprised to get your text.

15:33.049 --> 15:35.099
Usually you need a Ouija board

15:35.134 --> 15:36.974
to communicate with the devil.

15:38.655 --> 15:40.822
You look nice, KC.

15:40.857 --> 15:42.097
Oh, thanks, traitor.

15:51.584 --> 15:55.303
All right, Erica, cut to the chase.
What do you want from us?

15:55.338 --> 15:57.312
You and your daughter are
going to carry out

15:57.348 --> 15:59.473
a very special mission
for the Other Side.

15:59.509 --> 16:01.575
And if we refuse?

16:01.610 --> 16:04.946
Darien will end up
having another accident.

16:04.981 --> 16:07.048
And don't say a word about this,

16:07.050 --> 16:09.917
or we'll move on to
getting rid of your family.

16:09.953 --> 16:12.313
Ooh, I vote we start with her.

16:13.581 --> 16:16.057
Very funny, KC.

16:16.092 --> 16:18.476
But the Organization
won't be laughing

16:18.478 --> 16:20.053
when they find out
your mother's been protecting me

16:20.088 --> 16:21.562
all these years.

16:21.597 --> 16:24.089
Do I make myself clear?

16:24.124 --> 16:26.484
Crystal.

16:26.519 --> 16:30.430
We'll provide further
instructions when we're ready.

16:30.465 --> 16:33.524
Now, ladies,
let's enjoy our tea.

16:34.669 --> 16:37.478
Would anyone like some clotted
cream for their scone?

16:37.513 --> 16:39.280
Oh, I would, thank you.

16:41.067 --> 16:43.959
Oops. Oh, I'm so clumsy.

16:43.994 --> 16:46.495
Don't wanna waste it.

16:52.236 --> 16:53.819
Get ready, Colin,

16:53.854 --> 16:56.163
'cause this volcano's
about to blow.

16:56.198 --> 16:57.548
Here we go. It's going in.

16:57.583 --> 16:59.892
All right. Okay.

16:59.928 --> 17:02.645
Oh, awesome!

17:02.680 --> 17:04.546
Biggest explosion ever.

17:04.582 --> 17:08.559
Guess you never heard Ernie
after a four-cheese pizza.

17:10.371 --> 17:13.881
I'll bet you're wondering
how I'm gonna top this volcano.

17:13.916 --> 17:15.775
Two words: Rock collection.

17:19.697 --> 17:22.798
What a dork.

17:22.834 --> 17:25.251
What?! I thought
you looked up to him.

17:25.286 --> 17:27.904
I did, when I was five,

17:27.939 --> 17:30.548
and my best friend
was a blanket.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.492
Then why have you been
kissing his butt all week?

17:33.528 --> 17:36.721
My dad said I had to be
on my best behavior

17:36.723 --> 17:40.408
but how much longer
can I pretend he's interesting?

17:40.443 --> 17:43.094
He's a total doofus,
and he doesn't even know it.

17:43.129 --> 17:45.054
Rock collection.

17:45.089 --> 17:50.276
Hey, nobody thinks Ernie's
a bigger doofus than I do,

17:50.278 --> 17:53.720
but at least he's smart
and funny and he's honest.

17:53.756 --> 17:56.465
He doesn't pretend to be
something he's not,

17:56.500 --> 17:58.660
which makes him
way cooler than you'll ever be.

18:03.215 --> 18:05.457
Why did they have to drag
Darien into this?

18:05.492 --> 18:07.084
All he did was like me.

18:07.119 --> 18:08.911
I finally have a boyfriend,

18:08.946 --> 18:10.604
and now Erica and Abby
want to hurt him.

18:10.640 --> 18:13.323
I'm so sorry, honey.

18:13.359 --> 18:16.251
But you remember when
you decided to be a spy

18:16.287 --> 18:16.902
and I said
it wasn't gonna be easy?

18:16.938 --> 18:20.223
Decided?

18:20.225 --> 18:23.008
No, I distinctly remember
you fake kidnapping me

18:23.043 --> 18:25.553
and then begging me to be
part of the family business.

18:25.588 --> 18:30.057
True, but I distinctly remember
saying it wasn't gonna be easy.

18:32.703 --> 18:35.479
( Sighs ) Mom, I really,
really like Darien.

18:35.514 --> 18:38.840
What am I supposed to do,
just no like anyone ever?

18:38.876 --> 18:41.101
No, baby.

18:41.137 --> 18:44.112
But any time you get
involved with a civilian,

18:44.148 --> 18:46.207
they're always
gonna be vulnerable.

18:46.242 --> 18:49.134
So I should only date spies.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.970
Well, I was lucky enough
to fall in love with one.

18:52.006 --> 18:55.424
But I mean, it's not
like I never dated a civilian.

18:55.459 --> 18:57.417
I remember this one guy,

18:57.453 --> 18:59.428
Olympic athlete
Andre Vervavitch.

18:59.463 --> 19:02.932
Things were going great
until he fell head over heels.

19:02.967 --> 19:04.475
Wait, isn't that a good thing

19:04.510 --> 19:05.351
when you're dating someone?

19:05.386 --> 19:09.121
No, I mean the Other Side
pushed Andre off a building

19:09.156 --> 19:11.607
and he fell head over heels.

19:11.642 --> 19:13.225
Over head, over heels.

19:16.772 --> 19:17.721
This is just not fair.

19:17.756 --> 19:19.648
I know.

19:19.684 --> 19:21.742
But that's the way it is.

19:21.777 --> 19:23.719
<i>So what do we do now?</i>

19:23.754 --> 19:25.429
<i>Well, we have to wait for Erica,</i>

19:25.464 --> 19:29.350
<i>'cause unfortunately,
she's holding all the cards.</i>

19:29.385 --> 19:32.010
Okay, so now we know
Erica's back.

19:32.046 --> 19:33.637
We're not gonna make a move.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.322
I think, if we play
our cards right,

19:35.358 --> 19:38.934
she might finally lead us
to the head of the Other Side.

19:38.970 --> 19:41.095
Imagine, after all this time,

19:41.130 --> 19:43.422
finally discovering
who he really is.

19:49.063 --> 19:50.596
Hey, Ernie,
how'd your procedure go?

19:50.631 --> 19:51.755
What procedure?

19:51.791 --> 19:55.843
The one where they removed
Colin's lips from your butt.

19:55.878 --> 19:58.504
He's with his mom.

19:58.539 --> 20:00.089
And you can bag on me
all you want,

20:00.124 --> 20:03.626
- but I know you love me.
- Yuck! Why would you say that?

20:03.661 --> 20:06.512
Because I heard all the nice
things you said about me to Colin.

20:06.547 --> 20:08.330
- You're dreaming.
- Am I?

20:08.366 --> 20:09.931
Am I really?

20:09.967 --> 20:12.067
( Tape rewinding )

20:12.103 --> 20:13.936
He doesn't pretend to be
something he's not,

20:13.971 --> 20:16.830
which makes him
way cooler than you'll ever be.

20:16.866 --> 20:19.833
Way cooler than you'll ever be.

20:19.869 --> 20:21.577
Way cooler than you'll ever be.

20:21.612 --> 20:23.671
Fine, I said it!

20:23.706 --> 20:25.756
And?

20:25.791 --> 20:28.467
And I love you.

20:28.502 --> 20:29.760
And I love you.

20:29.795 --> 20:32.263
And I love you.

20:32.298 --> 20:33.538
And I love you.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.644
Well, Jackson,
I thought it over,

20:39.680 --> 20:41.280
and if you still want me,

20:41.315 --> 20:44.075
I'd be happy to
head up your security team

20:44.110 --> 20:46.160
through the election.
In fact, it would

20:46.195 --> 20:48.879
be an honor, Mr. Vice-President.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.798
( Protesting ) No jinxies.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.742
Yeah, right.

20:53.778 --> 20:55.795
You are definitely mature enough

20:55.830 --> 20:57.470
to be a heartbeat
away from the president.

20:58.782 --> 21:01.592
- Thank you, Craig.
- ( both laughing )

21:01.627 --> 21:03.635
All kidding aside,
I'll feel a lot safer,

21:03.670 --> 21:05.362
with you in my corner.

21:05.397 --> 21:07.506
Don't worry, I got your back.

21:07.541 --> 21:10.634
You never know what kind of
crazies there are out there.

21:17.267 --> 21:19.507
So what exactly is the plan
for KStop calling me that. re

21:20.538 --> 21:21.612
Fifteen years ago,

21:21.647 --> 21:25.215
when your father became
the head of the Other Side,

21:25.250 --> 21:27.210
he and I had
a little disagreement.

21:28.671 --> 21:31.497
I wanted her dead.

21:31.532 --> 21:34.984
And silly me,
I wanted to stay alive.

21:35.019 --> 21:37.236
So we compromised.
She disappeared.

21:37.271 --> 21:40.314
You mean you banished me.

21:40.349 --> 21:42.883
And separated me
from my only child.

21:42.885 --> 21:44.009
And she was better off
without the likes of you.

21:44.045 --> 21:47.170
Aw, Mom, Dad.

21:47.206 --> 21:47.930
Just think of
all the Christmases

21:47.965 --> 21:51.175
we could've spent together
as one big, unhappy family.

21:53.595 --> 21:56.313
Anyway, he finally sent for me,

21:56.348 --> 21:58.824
because he needed
his top programmer.

21:58.860 --> 22:01.743
Programmer? You can't even
use your cell phone.

22:01.779 --> 22:03.553
Not that kind of
programmer, smart mouth.

22:03.589 --> 22:05.606
- She gets it from you, you know.
- Take that back.

22:05.641 --> 22:09.209
I'd like to take back
the ten years I wasted with you.

22:09.245 --> 22:12.021
Was it only ten?
'Cause it felt like 110.

22:12.056 --> 22:13.814
I will crash this car right now.

22:13.849 --> 22:16.275
Do it, do it! I dare you!

22:16.310 --> 22:18.969
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

22:19.005 --> 22:22.731
Um... sorry to interrupt
this love fest,

22:22.766 --> 22:25.141
but you were saying something
about being a programmer.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.836
A mind control programmer.

22:27.871 --> 22:31.506
My mission was to identify
up-and-coming individuals

22:31.542 --> 22:33.267
who might one day wield power.

22:33.302 --> 22:35.952
Then I brainwash them,
so that when the time came,

22:35.988 --> 22:37.637
I'd activate them.

22:37.673 --> 22:38.873
And your mother's grating voice

22:38.908 --> 22:42.017
is one half of the trigger.
You're wearing the other half.

22:44.229 --> 22:46.069
The locket Aunt Kira gave me.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.000
I knew she'd keep it safe.

22:50.036 --> 22:53.436
She was always such a sentimental sap.
Softie.

22:54.773 --> 22:58.425
With this, my voice
will control the mind

22:58.461 --> 23:00.794
of Senator Jackson Cleveland,

23:00.829 --> 23:02.021
who's about to become
vice-president.

23:02.056 --> 23:07.108
Which puts him one step away
from becoming the president.

23:07.144 --> 23:09.320
When that happens,

23:09.355 --> 23:12.047
the Other side
will control the White House.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.998
Hi, KC. Guess what.

23:29.033 --> 23:31.392
I get out tomorrow.

23:31.427 --> 23:33.476
Doctor said in a couple of days,

23:33.512 --> 23:35.028
I'll be ready for
that Skee Ball rematch.

23:35.064 --> 23:38.098
Uh, Darien, I'm not into you.

23:38.133 --> 23:40.642
What are you talking about?

23:40.677 --> 23:42.027
I like you, you like me.
Things are going great.

23:42.062 --> 23:43.929
No, they're not.

23:43.964 --> 23:46.106
Not for me.

23:46.142 --> 23:48.775
Oh. I get it.

23:48.810 --> 23:50.436
It's the boyfriend-girlfriend
thing.

23:50.471 --> 23:52.070
We can slow it down.

23:52.105 --> 23:53.905
Darien, you're
not listening, okay?

23:53.941 --> 23:55.833
I don't like you.

23:55.868 --> 23:57.259
I'm breaking up with you.

23:57.294 --> 23:59.703
No.

23:59.738 --> 24:01.913
No, this makes no sense.

24:01.949 --> 24:03.299
This isn't right.

24:03.334 --> 24:05.893
Something else must be going on.

24:05.928 --> 24:07.603
KC, talk to me.

24:10.291 --> 24:11.291
Take care, Darien.

24:21.143 --> 24:24.411
I know, baby. I know.

24:26.540 --> 24:28.500
But at least now,
he'll be safe, okay?

24:30.536 --> 24:33.136
<i>Rob, your name's on TV.</i>
