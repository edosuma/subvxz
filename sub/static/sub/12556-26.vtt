THE SLOVV VVALK TO THE LITTLE
ROOM, OR E\/EN DEATH ITSELF.

02:59.888 --> 03:03.927
IT'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT HOLDS ADAM
GRANT IN THE HOT, SVVEATY GRIP OF FEAR.

03:04.017 --> 03:07.931
SOMETHING VVORSE THAN ANY PUNISHMENT

IT'S MY FAULT. I--

[sighs]

04:17.048 --> 04:19.836
I GOT YOU OUT OF A
BAD MOVIE I SAW ONCE,

<i>PHILLIPS!
SHUT YOUR FACE!</i>

A MONTH AGO, HE VVAS A HUMAN BEING.
NOVV VVHAT IS HE?

05:00.884 --> 05:03.876
AN ANIMAL,
A THING. WHY?

05:03.970 --> 05:06.632
BECAUSE HE COULDN'T
STOP THINKING ABOUT IT.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.839
I KNOW IT.

05:08.934 --> 05:13.144

<i>SOMETIMES I WONDER, TOO,

05:24.658 --> 05:26.524

WHAT IT'S LIKE.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.327
YOU WALK OUT
OF YOUR CELL,

05:31.373 --> 05:34.081
PASS TWO GRAY DOORS,

05:34.167 --> 05:39.537
SEVENTY-EIGHT STEPS TO THE FINAL DOOR.
IT'S PAINTED GREEN.

05:39.631 --> 05:43.670
THERE'S A GUARD THAT OPENS THE DOOR
FOR YOU, AND YOU GO INTO A ROOM.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.382
IT'S TAN.

05:50.475 --> 05:53.433
IT'S ALL TAN.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.638
THERE'S NOTHING IN IT
EXCEPT ONE CHAIR.

05:57.732 --> 06:01.566
<i>IT'S LIKE A CHAIR YOU USED TO SIT IN WHEN
YOU WERE A KID. IT'S HARD AND SOLID.</i>

06:01.653 --> 06:03.860
AH, CUT IT OUT,
CUT IT OUT.

06:03.905 --> 06:07.273
THEY STRAP YOUR
ARMS AND LEGS.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.405
THEN THEY ATTACH
THE ELECTRODES.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.868
IT'S FUNNY.

06:15.959 --> 06:18.542
THEY ALWAYS FEEL COLD
TO THE TOUCH AT FIRST.

06:18.587 --> 06:22.296
AVV, GRANT, YOU TALK LIKE YOU
BEEN THROUGH IT ALREADY.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.875
THEN THEY
DROP THE MASK.

06:25.927 --> 06:29.966
IT'S MUSTY. IT SMELLS
LIKE AN OLD SOFA.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.969
AND THEN YOU WAIT.

06:34.728 --> 06:38.221
EVERY MUSCLE
TENSE, STRAINING.

06:40.108 --> 06:43.271
<i>ANY SECOND,
ANY SECOND.</i>

06:43.361 --> 06:46.228
THEN YOU CAN
ALMOST HEAR IT.

06:47.616 --> 06:49.232
THEY PULL THE SWITCH.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.696
[humming]

07:04.299 --> 07:06.415
<i>[doorbell rings]</i>

FOOD AND LODGING FOR THE NIGHT.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.688
YOU'RE LOADED.

07:21.775 --> 07:25.109
HANK, I'VE JUST BEEN
INSULTED BY YOUR WIFE.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.360
SHE'S SAYS I'M LOADED.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.949
WELL, AREN'T YOU?

07:28.990 --> 07:31.197
THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

07:34.788 --> 07:38.497
HEY. HEY, TAKE IT EASY.
THAT'S MY BEST GIN.

07:40.961 --> 07:44.374
DEAR FRIENDS,
WHEN I DIE

07:44.464 --> 07:47.502
I DON'T WANNA SEE
ANY FULL BOTTLES AROUND.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.378
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.836
IT WASN'T MEANT TO BE.

07:51.930 --> 07:54.888
IT VVAS MEANT TO BE A
COMMENT ON THE SHORT,

07:54.975 --> 07:59.344
UNHAPPY LIFE
OF PAUL CARSON.

07:59.437 --> 08:00.939
COME.

08:03.149 --> 08:06.392
DRINK AND BE MERRY,

08:06.486 --> 08:08.068
FOR TOMORROW--

08:08.154 --> 08:11.488
OH, SHUT UP, PAUL.

08:11.574 --> 08:13.656
<i>SORRY.</i>

08:20.667 --> 08:24.752
<i>WELL, ONLY A
FEW MORE HOURS.</i>

08:24.838 --> 08:27.580
I KNEW IT. I KNEW IT
THE MINUTE YOU WALKED IN.

08:27.674 --> 08:31.417
VVE'RE NOT NERVOUS ENOUGH. OH, NO, VVE
HA\/E TO LISTEN TO THE GREAT OITY EDITOR

08:31.511 --> 08:34.003
WITH HIS NEWS
BEHIND THE NEWS.

08:34.054 --> 08:37.844
IF I'M NOT WELCOME HERE, THEN I SHALL
GO ELSEWHERE AND BREATHE MY LAST--

08:37.892 --> 08:41.429
OH, NEVER MIND. I'\/E HAD
ENOUGH OF THIS VVAKE ANYVVAY.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.102
GOOD NIGHT, DEAR.

08:43.188 --> 08:45.271
WHAT ABOUT DINNER?

08:45.358 --> 08:47.474
LOST MY APPETITE.

08:51.156 --> 08:53.523
OH, THE STEAK CAN COME
OUT IN FI\/E MINUTES.

08:55.660 --> 08:56.775
HANK.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.577
NOW, DON'T START IT.

08:58.663 --> 09:01.371
I'VE GOT TO START IT.
I'M NOT UPSET OR DISTURBED

09:01.458 --> 09:03.620
OR NERVOUS ANYMORE.
I'M SCARED.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.542
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.874
I KNOVV IT IS, I KNOVV IT
IS, BUT THAT DOESN'T HELP.

09:07.964 --> 09:11.207
DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU
BELIEVE THAT CRAZY STORY?

09:11.301 --> 09:13.463
GOD, HELP ME,
HANK, BUT I DO.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.385
AT LEAST, I BELIEVE
IT'S POSSIBLE.

09:15.472 --> 09:17.964
VVELL, VVHY NOT? CAN
VVE PROVE HE'S VVRONG?

09:18.058 --> 09:21.392
MAYBE NOT, BUT THAT'S A POOR
REASON FOR BELIEVING IN ANYTHING.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.936
I CAN'T PROVE THAT THE
VVORLD ISN'T GOING TO END.

09:26.691 --> 09:29.729
BUT IT ISN'T.

09:29.778 --> 09:32.145
THIS GUY KILLED
A MAN IN COLD BLOOD,

09:32.238 --> 09:34.821
AND HE'S GOING TO PAY FOR IT.
THOSE ARE THE FACTS.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.491
ANYTHING ELSE IS
SPECULATION, FANTASY.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.490
<i>ARE YOU SURE'? THEN WHAT ARE
YOU SO STEAMED UP ABOUT'?</i>

09:40.580 --> 09:43.663
I'LL TELL YOU VVHY. BECAUSE A
LITTLE PART OF YOU BELIE\/ES, TOO.

09:43.750 --> 09:47.744
JUST A LITTLE, TINY PART OF HENRY RITCHIE
SAYS, "MAYBE THIS GRANT IS RIGHT.

09:47.796 --> 09:51.005
MAYBE THIS IS ALL A DREAM." THE THOUGHT
HAS OCCURRED TO YOU, HASN'T IT?

09:51.091 --> 09:54.425
HANK, HAVEN'T YOU EVER STOPPED AND
SAID, "THIS COULDN'T BE REAL.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.426
"I COULDN'T BE
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY.

09:56.513 --> 09:58.754
"I COULDN'T HA\/E A
LOVELY VVIFE LIKE CAROL,

09:58.848 --> 10:03.263
"AND A LOVELY HOME AND MONEY IN THE
BANK, NOT IN ANY REAL VVORLD."

10:03.353 --> 10:04.969
HAVEN'T YOU, HANK?

10:05.063 --> 10:07.100
WELL, OF COURSE.
EVERYONE HAS.

10:07.190 --> 10:09.932
IF YOU'RE A SUCCESS, YOU'RE
BOUND TO THINK IT'S A DREAM.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.937
IF NOT, YOU THINK
IT'S A NIGHTMARE.

10:12.028 --> 10:14.611
THIS ONLY PROVES
THAT GRANT IS HUMAN.

10:14.656 --> 10:16.772
HE CAN'T BELIEVE
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO HIM,

10:16.825 --> 10:20.159
SO HE TRIES TO CONVINCE HIMSELF
THAT IT ISN'T, NOT REALLY.

10:20.245 --> 10:23.328
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
I THOUGHT TOO AT FIRST.

10:23.414 --> 10:27.282
BUT HANK, I'\/E BEEN TALKING TO THIS
KID A LOT LATELY, AND HE MAKES SENSE.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.997
GO DOVVN AND SEE FOR YOURSELF.
DON'T TAKE MY VVORD FOR IT.

10:30.088 --> 10:31.453
IT WOULDN'T
DO ANY GOOD.

10:31.506 --> 10:32.871
YOU ONLY LISTENED
TO HIM ONCE.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.582
THAT WAS ENOUGH.

10:34.676 --> 10:38.169
HANK, FOR MY SAKE,
PLEASE, GO AND SEE HIM.

10:38.263 --> 10:42.723
LET HIM TELL YOU.
PLEASE, HANK.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.550
IT'S POINTLESS BUT--

10:44.644 --> 10:46.009
THANKS.

10:47.730 --> 10:50.392
JIGGS. JIGGS!

10:50.483 --> 10:52.065
YEAH?

10:52.152 --> 10:54.143
<i>WHAT TIME IS IT?</i>

10:55.196 --> 10:57.187
9:05.

10:57.282 --> 11:00.070
WHY, YOU GOT
A DATE SOMEWHERE?

11:00.160 --> 11:03.073
NO, I'M JUST
EXPECTING SOMEONE.

11:03.163 --> 11:07.373
<i>THE GOVERNOR, RIGHT? WITH A
NICE FAT PARDON IN HIS FIST.</i>

11:08.835 --> 11:10.542
NO, IT'S THE
DISTRICT ATTORNEY.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.585
HE USUALLY COMES
AROUND ABOUT 9:00.

11:12.672 --> 11:17.337
OH, YOU DON'T SAY?
THE D.A. HIMSELF, HUH?

11:17.385 --> 11:21.674
YEAH, YEAH,
THE D.A. HIMSELF.

11:21.723 --> 11:24.966
AH, YOU GOT A GREAT
SENSE OF HUMOR, PAL.

11:27.228 --> 11:31.847
VVAIT A MINUTE. THERE'S SOMETHING
ELSE THAT DOESN'T VVORK. THE VVATCH.

11:31.941 --> 11:36.606
PRISONERS ABOUT TO BE EXECUTED AREN'T ALLOVVED
TO VVEAR WATCHES BECAUSE OF THE GLASS.

11:39.991 --> 11:43.859
YOU SEE? HE'S RIGHT
ON TIME, HUH, JIGGS?

11:46.414 --> 11:48.280
TEN MINUTES,
MR. RITCHIE.

11:48.374 --> 11:51.116
ALL RIGHT. YOU CAN
LEAVE US ALONE.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.458
HELLO, GRANT.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.630
HELLO, MR. RITCHIE.

12:05.099 --> 12:07.477
YOU DON'T SEEM
SURPRISED TO SEE ME.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.052
I'M NOT.
YOU ALWAYS COME.

12:10.104 --> 12:13.392
I MEAN, THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY ALVVAYS
COMES. IT ISN'T ALVVAYS YOU.

12:13.483 --> 12:14.644
GRANT.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.645
YES?

12:16.736 --> 12:20.604
I TAKE IT YOU'RE STICKING TO
THIS DREAM STORY OF YOURS.

12:20.698 --> 12:22.735
THAT'S RIGHT.

12:22.784 --> 12:24.821
IT CAN'T POSSIBLY
DO YOU ANY GOOD NOW.

12:24.911 --> 12:27.073
YOU REALIZE THAT--

12:27.163 --> 12:31.122
I SHOULD, AFTER ALL THIS
TIME, EVERY NIGHT I EXPLAIN.

12:31.209 --> 12:33.496
EVERY NIGHT
IT'S THE SAME.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.749
ALL RIGHT,
EXPLAIN AGAIN.

12:36.839 --> 12:39.672
WELL, IT'S VERY SIMPLE.
WHEN I DIE, YOU DIE,

12:39.759 --> 12:43.923
AND EVERYBODY IN THIS VVORLD DIES
BECAUSE THIS VVORLD DOES NOT EXIST.

12:44.013 --> 12:47.802
IT'S A DREAM OF MINE. IT'S A NIGHTMARE.
CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

12:47.892 --> 12:50.930
NO, GRANT, I CAN'T
UNDERSTAND THAT.

12:51.020 --> 12:54.513
NOT BECAUSE IT'S A NEVV IDEA. I
CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT CR ACCEPT IT

12:54.607 --> 12:59.022
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY KIND OF LOGICAL SENSE.

12:59.112 --> 13:02.104
BUT IT DOES. IT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT DOES MAKE LOGICAL SENSE.

13:02.156 --> 13:04.864
TAKE YOU, FOR INSTANOE. DO YOU
THINK YOU'D BE VISITING A MAN

13:04.951 --> 13:07.989
THAT VVAS JUST ABOUT TO BE EXECUTED
IN REAL LIFE? OF COURSE NOT.

13:08.079 --> 13:10.787
THEY WOULDN'T ALLOVV YOU IN HERE.
OR YOU TAKE ME.

13:10.873 --> 13:15.288
YOU DON'T KNOVV ANY MORE ABOUT ME NOVV THAN YOU
DID VVHEN THIS THING STARTED. I'M A STRANGER.

13:15.336 --> 13:17.668
THERE ARE A HUNDRED
VAGRANTS IN EVERY TOWN

13:17.755 --> 13:20.793
VVITHOUT NAMES, VVITHOUT HISTORIES.
STOP THAT!

13:24.470 --> 13:27.212
WE KNOW YOU'RE
MENTALLY SOUND.

13:27.307 --> 13:30.299
AND I DON'T THINK YOU'RE
DELIBERATELY LYING TO ME.

13:33.187 --> 13:37.476
I'M GONNA DESTROY THAT STORY OF
YOURS, GRANT, NOVV, ONCE AND FOR ALL.

13:37.525 --> 13:40.563
YOU SAY THAT ALL
THIS IS A DREAM,

13:40.653 --> 13:43.031
AND THAT WHEN YOU'RE
ELECTROCUTED YOU WAKE UP,

13:43.114 --> 13:45.697
AND WHEN YOU WAKE UP,
WE ALL DISAPPEAR, RIGHT?

13:45.783 --> 13:47.490
THAT'S RIGHT.

13:47.577 --> 13:49.989
WHAT ABOUT OUR PARENTS
AND OUR PARENTS' PARENTS,

13:50.079 --> 13:52.332
AND EVERYBODY WHO NEVER
EVEN HEARD OF YOU?

13:52.415 --> 13:56.579
VVHAT ABOUT THEM, MR. RITCHIE? A DREAM
BUILDS ITS OVVN VVORLD, MR. RITCHIE.

13:56.669 --> 14:02.415
IT'S COMPLETE. VVITH A PAST, AND, AS
LONG AS YOU STAY ASLEEP, A FUTURE.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.761
WHAT ABOUT US THEN
WHEN WE SLEEP AND DREAM?

14:04.844 --> 14:06.710
OR IS THAT WHEN
YOU'RE UP AND AROUND?

14:06.804 --> 14:10.763
YOU ONLY SLEEP AND DREAM
BECAUSE I DREAM YOU THAT VVAY.

14:10.850 --> 14:14.559
ALL RIGHT,
NOW ANSWER ME THIS.

14:14.645 --> 14:18.013
YOU'RE SCARED NOW.
WHY? WHY ARE YOU SCARED?

14:18.066 --> 14:21.275
YOU'VE GOT TO VVAKE UP SOMETIME
E\/EN IF YOU'RE ELECTROCUTED.

14:21.361 --> 14:24.319
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST
SIT BACK AND ENJOY IT?

14:27.700 --> 14:29.862
ENJOY IT?

14:35.500 --> 14:40.961
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. MR.
RITCHIE, HOVV SOUNDLY DO YOU SLEEP?

14:41.047 --> 14:42.958
WELL, I MEAN,
YOU DREAM, DON'T YOU?

14:43.049 --> 14:44.790
CERTAINLY, SOMETIMES.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.342
HAVEN'T YOU EVER BEEN HURT
IN ONE OF THOSE DREAMS?

14:47.428 --> 14:51.888
HA\/EN'T YOU EVER FALLEN OUT OF A VVINDOVV
OR BEEN DROVVNED OR TORTURED? YOU HA\/E!

14:51.933 --> 14:54.391
DON'T YOU REMEMBER
HOW REAL IT HAD SEEMED?

14:54.477 --> 14:57.265
REMEMBER HOW YOU
WOKE UP SCREAMING?

14:57.355 --> 15:01.314
<i>WELL, LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. HOW DO YOU
LIKE TO WAKE UP SCREAMING EVERY NIGHT?</i>

15:01.401 --> 15:05.941
<i>THA T55' I/I/HA T I DO- BECAUSE</i> I <i>DREAM THE
SAME DREAM NIGHT AFTER NIGHT AFTER NIGHT!</i>

15:06.030 --> 15:08.488
IT'S THIS ONE!

15:08.574 --> 15:13.068
IT CHANGES A LITTLE BIT. THE PEOPLE GET
TVVISTED AROUND, BUT IT'S THE SAME DREAM.

15:13.121 --> 15:16.955
YOU'\/E GOT TO BELIEVE ME! I CAN'T
GO ON DYING! I CAN'T GO ON DYING!

15:17.041 --> 15:19.578
I CAN'T, I CAN'T--

15:19.669 --> 15:21.455
I'M TELLING THE
TRUTH, MR. RITCHIE!

15:21.546 --> 15:24.413
PLEASE, LET ME LIVE
AND I'LL KEEP YOU ALIVE.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.581
I'LL DREAM YOU EVERY
NIGHT JUST LIKE THIS.

15:26.676 --> 15:28.838
WAIT A MINUTE!
I'LL PROVE IT TO YOU.

15:28.928 --> 15:32.512
YOU VVIFE, SHE HAS A STEAK COOKING FOR YOU.
GO HOME, LOOK IN THE O\/EN.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.930
<i>IT'LL BE
SOMETHING ELSE.</i>

15:34.976 --> 15:36.762
<i>PLEASE!</i>

15:42.275 --> 15:44.016
WELL?

15:47.613 --> 15:50.446
WHAT'S WRONG, HANK?

15:50.491 --> 15:53.108
THAT'S A ROAST.

15:53.202 --> 15:55.660
WHAT ABOUT IT?

15:55.746 --> 15:57.282
HANK, WHAT ABOUT IT?

16:08.801 --> 16:11.793
<i>(Jiggs)

16:11.888 --> 16:13.174
HUH?

16:13.264 --> 16:14.971

16:15.016 --> 16:17.303

16:20.646 --> 16:22.228
NO.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.056

16:24.150 --> 16:25.561
NOTHING'S FUNNY.

16:25.651 --> 16:29.485
WELL, YOU WAS
LAUGHING. I HEARD YA.

16:29.530 --> 16:32.397
HEY, GRANT, LISTEN,

16:32.492 --> 16:34.984
I BEEN THINKING
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID,

16:35.077 --> 16:37.990
ABOUT THIS ALL BEING
A DREAM AND ALL.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.492
WELL, NOW, MAYBE
IT WON'T WORK,

16:40.541 --> 16:44.000
BUT IF YOU TOLD THAT STORY TO THE GOVERNOR,
HE MIGHT LET YOU OUT ON A PSYOHO.

16:44.045 --> 16:47.083
HE WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME.

16:47.173 --> 16:49.255
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,
DO YOU, JIGGS?

16:49.342 --> 16:51.583
<i>OH, THAT'S GOT
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.</i>

16:51.677 --> 16:53.839
IF YOU THINK
IT'S TRUE, SEE,

16:53.930 --> 16:56.092
WHY, THEN YOU GOT
A LOOSE COG SOMEWHERE,

16:56.182 --> 16:58.344
AND THEY DON'T BURN
GUYS WITH LOOSE COGS.

16:58.392 --> 17:01.259
WHAT IF I
PROVED IT TO YOU?

17:01.354 --> 17:03.015
<i>HOW?</i>

17:05.398 --> 17:09.188
VVELL, JIGGS, DON'T YOU THINK
THAT ALL OF THIS IS JUST-

17:09.278 --> 17:11.770
JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH
THE VVAY IT SHOULD BE?

17:11.864 --> 17:13.855
I DON'T GET YOU.

17:13.950 --> 17:16.066
WELL, I MEAN
IT'S SO PAT.

17:16.160 --> 17:19.778
I GOT TRIED AND SENTENCED THE SAME DAY.
IT DOESN'T VVORK LIKE THAT.

17:19.872 --> 17:25.367
BUT YOU SEE, THAT'S THE VVAY THAT I SAVV IT
IN MY MIND AND SO THAT'S THE VVAY IT IS.

17:25.419 --> 17:29.413
OR Y-YOU TAKE THIS PLACE HERE.
YOU AND COLEY AND HIS HARMONICA,

17:29.507 --> 17:31.965
<i>OR PHILLIPS
AND HIS MOTHER.</i>

17:32.051 --> 17:35.089
<i>[laughing]</i>

17:35.179 --> 17:36.920
IT'S LIKE A MOVIE.

17:37.014 --> 17:38.800
REAL DEATH HOUSES
AREN'T LIKE THAT.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.974
BUT YOU SEE, I'VE NEVER
BEEN IN A REAL DEATH HOUSE

17:42.061 --> 17:44.803
SO THAT'S, THAT'S MY
IMPRESSION OF IT.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.810
MAN, YOU'VE
REALLY FLIPPED.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.483
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

17:58.786 --> 18:01.073
WELL, THE BROTHERS
GRIMM, AS I IIVE--

18:01.163 --> 18:03.245
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING UP?

18:03.332 --> 18:07.667
I'M NOT UP. I'M DOVVN, JUST LIKE
YOU AND YOUR FUNNY FRIEND HERE.

18:07.753 --> 18:08.834
<i>HAVE THEY-</i>

18:08.921 --> 18:11.583
FIFTEEN MORE MINUTES.

18:14.260 --> 18:17.798
THAT'S ANOTHER THING. VVHY DOES THIS
ALVVAYS HAPPEN AROUND MIDNIGHT?

18:17.888 --> 18:19.504
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHEN IT HAPPENS.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.931
YEAH, BUT WHY?

18:21.976 --> 18:24.809
ACCORDING TO GRANT, HE DOESN'T
KNOVV ANYTHING ABOUT THESE MATTERS

18:24.895 --> 18:28.263
EXCEPT VVHAT HE SEES IN THE MOVIES. IN THE
MOVIES, IT ALVVAYS HAPPENS AT MIDNIGHT.

18:28.357 --> 18:30.348
BECAUSE MOVIES ARE
TECHNICALLY ACCURATE.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.855
THAT'S STRANGE, TOO, VVHEN
YOU COME TO THINK OF IT.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.232
THEN DON'T COME
TO THINK OF IT.

18:39.243 --> 18:42.452
<i>(JIQQS) HEY, SCREWS,
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME.</i>

18:42.496 --> 18:46.956
YOU CAN'T KILL HIM. YOU VVANT TO
KNOVV VVHY? I'LL TELL YOU VVHY.

18:47.043 --> 18:52.004
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOTHING BUT DREAMS.
DREAMS! YOU HEAR THAT, SCREVVS?

19:02.183 --> 19:04.720
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU WISH TO SAY

19:04.810 --> 19:09.304
IN THESE FEW MOMENTS
REMAINING TO YOU, MY SON?

19:09.357 --> 19:11.189
NO.

19:12.485 --> 19:15.318
THEN LET US PRAY.

19:15.363 --> 19:17.570
THERE'S NO NEED.

19:17.657 --> 19:22.026
THERE'S ALWAYS A NEED
FOR PRAYER, MY SON.

19:22.119 --> 19:25.737
ONLY IN THE REAL VVORLD,
FATHER, NOT IN A NIGHTMARE.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.914
YOU FEEL DETACHED
FROM REALITY?

19:29.001 --> 19:31.993
[laughs softly]

19:32.046 --> 19:34.629
I NOT ONLY FEEL IT,
IAM DETACHED.

19:40.137 --> 19:44.677
I VVONDER VVHERE I'\/E SEEN YOU,
VVHERE YOUR FACE CAME FROM.

19:44.725 --> 19:49.344
IT'S FAMILIAR. ALMOST EVERY
TIME IT JUST ABOUT COMES TO ME.

19:49.397 --> 19:51.604
WE'VE NEVER MET.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.682
OH, YES.

19:53.776 --> 19:56.734
YES, WE HAVE.

OH, EVERYBODY
CAME TO YOUR FUNERAL.

20:08.082 --> 20:10.039
MY NAME IS

20:10.126 --> 20:15.041
YES, AND-AND THEN A YOUNG PRIEST
CAME AND TOOK YOUR PLACE--

20:15.089 --> 20:17.547
[laughs softly]

20:17.591 --> 20:20.253
THAT WAS CARSON.

HIM FOR THE EDITOR.

20:23.097 --> 20:24.804

20:24.890 --> 20:28.724
BUT WHAT ABOUT RITCHIE,
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY?

20:28.811 --> 20:32.395
HE MUST HAVE BEEN
A SCHOOLTEACHER OF MINE.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.898
MAYBE HE WAS
A FRIEND OF DAD'S.

20:56.714 --> 20:59.001
<i>(JiQQSI HEY, GRANT, THEY
CAN'T DO THIS TO YOU.</i>

20:59.091 --> 21:02.959

21:06.348 --> 21:08.305
<i>WAKE UP! WAKE UP!</i>

21:11.520 --> 21:14.433
YOU COULD AT LEAST GET A STAY OF EXECUTION.
I KNOVV YOU CAN DO THAT.

21:14.523 --> 21:18.107
VVHAT GOOD VVOULD IT DO? VVE'D SIMPLY HA\/E TO
GO THROUGH THE VVHOLE THING ALL OVER AGAIN.

21:18.194 --> 21:20.777
MAYBE NOT. LOOK, HANK. FORGET
ALL ABOUT THAT DREAM STUFF.

21:20.863 --> 21:25.278
WHETHER THAT'S TRUE OR NOT, IT DOESN'T MATTER.
THE KID BELIE\/ES IT. HE'S GOT A CASE.

21:25.326 --> 21:28.535
THE PSYCHIATRIST MADE A MISTAKE.
IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.953
GET A WEEK'S STAY. VVE'LL
THROVV IN ANOTHER TEAM.

21:31.040 --> 21:34.829
VVHY NOT? BECAUSE VVE MIGHT BE VVRONG?
VVELL, MAYBE VVE ARE, BUT MAYBE VVE'RE NOT,

21:34.919 --> 21:39.288
AND IN MY BOOK, THAT'S REASONABLE DOUBT.
HANK, THAT KID IS SICK IN THE HEAD.

21:39.381 --> 21:42.874
ARE YOU GONNA SEND A MENTAL
INCOMPETENT TO THE CHAIR?

21:50.476 --> 21:54.470
I REGRET THIS, PAUL. I'LL
REGRET THIS AS LONG AS I LI\/E.

22:01.570 --> 22:04.312
