WEBVTT

00:22.522 --> 00:23.830
Look at this.

00:24.157 --> 00:26.068
You think somebody
got here before us?

00:26.326 --> 00:27.999
You didn't tell anybody, did you?

00:28.061 --> 00:31.167
No, I didn't tell anybody.

00:31.231 --> 00:33.108
I'm going to be pissed
off if someone did.

00:34.100 --> 00:35.443
Open it.

01:00.493 --> 01:02.268
Ugh, it's warm.

01:02.429 --> 01:04.431
Maybe we should just
let this one go, man.

01:04.497 --> 01:07.307
No. Nobody else is
getting our copper.

01:18.878 --> 01:20.221
Shh.

01:22.082 --> 01:25.495
Someone's here. There's no
truck outside except ours.

01:25.785 --> 01:27.230
Maybe they already took a load.

01:27.287 --> 01:28.994
I mean, someone's still cutting.

01:29.055 --> 01:31.695
Well, they're going
to have to share.

01:36.162 --> 01:37.368
They've got a torch.

01:56.316 --> 01:58.193
Whoever's down here,
you better get the hell out.

01:59.152 --> 02:01.758
We're security, and we'll
arrest your ass if we find you.

02:08.661 --> 02:12.165
You take off now, and we'll
forget you were ever here.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.377
We're not going to tell you again.

02:21.207 --> 02:22.618
Get the hell out of here.

02:37.357 --> 02:38.665
I can't breathe.

02:54.073 --> 02:56.679
Idiot! You trying to
get yourself killed?

03:31.444 --> 03:33.947
Where are the bodies?
Downstairs in the basement.

03:34.013 --> 03:35.617
What condition? Toast.

03:36.015 --> 03:37.392
We get an ID yet?

03:37.483 --> 03:39.656
It's going to require dental work,
but we've got the pickup.

03:39.719 --> 03:42.290
Registered to Joseph Oliver,
small-time operator.

03:42.355 --> 03:44.801
I've arrested him a couple
of times for stealing scrap.

03:44.857 --> 03:47.565
But, I couldn't tell you that
was him in that basement.

03:47.627 --> 03:48.628
Ooh.

03:49.395 --> 03:52.808
Uh, we got the owner of the building,
Lance Truman, waiting to talk to you.

03:52.865 --> 03:55.004
He found the break-in this morning,
called it in.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.604
The guy with him is his contractor.

03:56.669 --> 03:58.876
ls Arson downstairs? Yeah.
It's Jordan Vance.

03:58.938 --> 04:01.646
He's downstairs, doing the prelim.
You want to talk to Truman?

04:01.708 --> 04:03.551
Oh, let's see what the
bodies have to say first.

04:03.610 --> 04:06.386
Okay. It's pretty rank down there.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.156
Looks like they were
here to steal the copper.

04:16.221 --> 04:17.997
We found a pile of it
in a cart over there.

04:18.057 --> 04:20.935
Were they using torches? WU:
if they were, we didn't find any.

04:20.994 --> 04:22.701
Well, then, how did they
set themselves on fire?

04:22.762 --> 04:25.572
I guess that's why we have
an arson investigator.

04:25.632 --> 04:26.872
Ooh.

04:31.337 --> 04:33.476
What do we got?

04:33.873 --> 04:36.911
Where's my "Good morning"?
Good morning, Jordan.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.616
What do we got?
Not a heck of a lot.

04:39.679 --> 04:42.285
Two dead men, I think.

04:42.348 --> 04:45.329
Don't know the source of the fire.
But it happened pretty quick.

04:45.385 --> 04:47.831
So, whatever they were working
with is extremely volatile.

04:47.887 --> 04:49.525
Don't know the source
of ignition, yet.

04:49.589 --> 04:52.934
Usually, you don't burn a body unless
you're trying to cover up a homicide.

04:52.992 --> 04:54.062
Well, that's if they were dead.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.630
Burn patterns suggest
ignition occurred here

04:56.696 --> 04:59.336
and they were thrown up against
the wall as a result of the blast.

04:59.399 --> 05:01.379
What, so someone doused them first?

05:01.701 --> 05:03.874
Explosion like this, had to be.

05:03.936 --> 05:06.007
Gasoline? No, we would smell that.

05:06.172 --> 05:07.651
I'll know more after
I run some tests.

05:08.074 --> 05:09.917
But here's the odd thing.

05:09.976 --> 05:12.013
A body has to burn for a few hours

05:12.078 --> 05:13.682
to reach this state of immolation.

05:13.746 --> 05:17.250
So, whatever it was got
really hot really fast.

05:17.684 --> 05:20.494
Like getting hit with napalm.

05:20.553 --> 05:22.464
That's kind of brutal.

05:22.522 --> 05:23.523
Let's talk with the owner.

05:25.825 --> 05:28.931
Uh, this is the third building
I own that's been hit.

05:29.362 --> 05:30.932
Anything copper, they take it.

05:31.297 --> 05:33.743
I put fences around my buildings.
I padlock them.

05:34.434 --> 05:35.469
It doesn't make any difference.

05:35.535 --> 05:38.072
They just cut into any
type of lock I put on it.

05:38.137 --> 05:39.480
Well, they didn't use
a welder's torch.

05:40.807 --> 05:43.481
There's no clean cut mark.
It's like

05:43.543 --> 05:45.318
the whole area around
the latch is melted.

05:45.478 --> 05:46.821
I don't know what they used,

05:46.879 --> 05:49.416
but that's the same as
all my other buildings.

05:52.118 --> 05:55.224
This feels like oil.
Anybody have a match?

05:55.288 --> 05:56.289
A lighter.

05:58.424 --> 06:00.768
Thanks. Yeah.

06:02.261 --> 06:03.706
Whoo. Damn.

06:04.864 --> 06:06.309
Am I reading this right? Lipids?

06:06.366 --> 06:08.277
Yes. Basically human fat.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.480
Human fat? Are you sure?

06:11.671 --> 06:12.945
No mistake about that.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.844
Mixed with a lot of methane.

06:14.907 --> 06:18.116
If sprayed and ignited, it will flash
and burn and become intensely hot.

06:18.578 --> 06:20.251
Where does someone get
that much human fat?

06:20.780 --> 06:22.953
Well, if it were beef,
I would say a butcher shop.

06:23.349 --> 06:25.522
But human fat...

06:25.585 --> 06:26.689
A morgue, maybe? I don't know.

06:26.753 --> 06:28.289
We're running samples for DNA.

06:28.354 --> 06:29.526
We think it's a homicide.

06:29.589 --> 06:32.092
Why? NICK: No evidence
of ignition at the scene.

06:32.158 --> 06:34.570
So, whoever set them on fire
had to have taken it with them.

06:34.627 --> 06:37.039
The same substance was used to
burn through the lock on the gate

06:37.096 --> 06:38.336
and the lock on the
loading dock door.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.435
And we found other instances
of similar break-ins,

06:40.500 --> 06:42.446
all at abandoned or
shut-down properties.

06:42.502 --> 06:44.812
Someone stealing copper is nothing new.
You check with the scrap yards?

06:44.871 --> 06:47.545
Yeah. According to them,
they're not seeing any copper.

06:47.974 --> 06:50.420
So, whoever's stealing
it isn't selling it.

06:50.476 --> 06:51.614
Makes a lot of sense.

06:53.012 --> 06:55.492
Sorry to interrupt.
Witness just came in.

06:55.548 --> 06:58.290
Says he saw somebody running away
from that building last night.

06:59.285 --> 07:02.027
I was driving by that
building last night.

07:02.088 --> 07:05.831
I didn't think anything of it until I heard
about the two guys dying on the news.

07:05.892 --> 07:07.530
You saw someone
outside the building?

07:07.593 --> 07:09.504
Yeah. He ran right in front of me.

07:11.764 --> 07:13.004
I almost hit him.

07:13.065 --> 07:14.442
I don't know if he had
anything to do with it.

07:14.500 --> 07:18.915
But he was there.
And he looked scared.

07:19.038 --> 07:20.278
Can you describe him?

07:20.339 --> 07:23.843
Huh. I'll never forget.
Half his face was scarred up.

07:24.644 --> 07:27.124
His hair was all scraggly.

07:27.180 --> 07:28.989
Looked like he hadn't
shaved in awhile.

07:29.048 --> 07:32.291
And he was wearing a long coat.
My guess is he was homeless.

07:32.585 --> 07:34.531
What happened after you stopped?

07:34.587 --> 07:38.034
I yelled at him for being an idiot.
He kept on running.

07:38.090 --> 07:39.660
You didn't see him
get into a vehicle?

07:40.326 --> 07:41.327
No.

07:41.994 --> 07:43.905
We'd like you to talk
to the police artist.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.965
See if you can work up a
sketch of what he looked like.

07:46.032 --> 07:47.033
Okay.

07:59.512 --> 08:01.082
That's pretty close.

08:06.686 --> 08:09.599
Hey. 9-1-1 call just came in.

08:09.655 --> 08:12.499
Lance Truman got attacked outside the
building where we found the burn vics.

08:13.092 --> 08:14.833
We've got a patrol car en route.

08:19.465 --> 08:21.809
We need an ambulance
at 391 Clark Street.

08:23.002 --> 08:25.812
He hit me. I think he's
still inside the building.

08:25.872 --> 08:28.443
Stay with him. Return to
the scene of the crime?

08:28.508 --> 08:30.488
If you see him, do not go near him.

08:30.543 --> 08:32.385
Keep a visual, and radio it.

09:06.178 --> 09:07.384
The shopping cart's gone.

09:07.513 --> 09:08.958
How did they get it upstairs?

09:09.048 --> 09:12.825
The elevator's not working.
The only way is the stairs.

09:12.885 --> 09:14.387
WU ON RADIO:
We've got movement up here.

09:28.868 --> 09:30.779
WU ON RADIO: I heard something.

09:31.470 --> 09:33.245
In the shipping and receiving area.

09:35.274 --> 09:37.777
Toward the back.

09:42.915 --> 09:45.953
I got sprayed. I can't breathe.

09:46.018 --> 09:49.522
Move back. Run.
Do not fire your gun.

09:59.031 --> 10:02.535
Stay where you are.

10:29.028 --> 10:30.166
You okay? Yeah. You?

10:30.229 --> 10:31.902
Yeah. Uh, I'm not.

10:31.998 --> 10:33.944
This stuff is in my eyes,
my nose, my ears...

10:34.000 --> 10:35.741
I saw him. It's definitely
the guy with the scar.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.041
You see where he went? No.

10:37.103 --> 10:38.138
Let's get him out of here.

10:38.204 --> 10:39.740
I like that idea a lot. Burkhardt.

10:40.673 --> 10:41.743
Yeah?

10:41.807 --> 10:43.878
It's Vance. He's got DNA
results on the lipids.

10:43.943 --> 10:45.149
We've got an ID. Go ahead.

10:55.554 --> 10:58.296
Fred Eberhart.
Forty-eight years old.

10:58.357 --> 11:00.837
Been in and out of the VA
hospital for several years now.

11:00.926 --> 11:03.099
Desert Storm vet and
decorated war hero.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.870
You talk to VA about him? I did.

11:05.931 --> 11:07.501
They said they haven't seen
him in the last six months.

11:07.566 --> 11:09.739
Evidently, Eberhart drops
off the grid quite a bit.

11:10.036 --> 11:11.845
Any known address? No.

11:12.138 --> 11:13.344
What about a last job?

11:13.939 --> 11:17.648
Worked as a welder for the rail road.
But they, uh, laid him off two years ago.

11:18.010 --> 11:21.082
Where's he from? Local boy.
Portland, born and raised.

11:21.380 --> 11:24.884
Any relatives here?
There's a daughter. Uh...

11:25.818 --> 11:29.197
Ariel Eberhart. VA had her
phone number as next of kin.

11:29.255 --> 11:31.030
Well, let's see if she's home.

11:32.191 --> 11:33.898
Did you get a look at
what Eberhart was using?

11:33.959 --> 11:35.097
Was it a tank of some kind?

11:35.161 --> 11:36.868
It was too dark to tell.

11:37.329 --> 11:40.242
But I heard some kind of noise.
Like a real bad smoker's cough.

11:40.299 --> 11:42.939
Next thing I know,
a ball of flame was coming at us.

11:43.936 --> 11:47.440
Well, it's not a home
phone or a cell phone.

11:48.240 --> 11:51.187
Got an answering machine
for Club Trop Chaud.

11:51.243 --> 11:53.484
Maybe she works there.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.321
It's on my way home.
I'll check it out.

11:56.782 --> 11:57.783
Hi. Hi.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.226
The show's already started.
But if you're alone,

11:59.285 --> 12:00.286
I could squeeze you in.

12:00.352 --> 12:04.357
Oh. I'm, uh,
looking for Ariel Eberhart.

12:04.724 --> 12:05.725
You know her?

12:09.595 --> 12:10.630
There she is.

13:08.020 --> 13:11.194
Hey, Nick. What are
you doing here, man?

13:12.391 --> 13:14.997
It's not exactly the last place in
the world I'd expect to see you,

13:15.060 --> 13:17.472
but, uh, pretty darn close.

13:17.663 --> 13:20.701
Do you come here a lot?
What, me? No.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.507
You know, sometimes.

13:24.737 --> 13:27.183
Okay, a lot. Come on.
She is smoking hot.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.556
I've got a case
involving her father.

13:37.616 --> 13:38.924
He's some kind of a...

13:40.586 --> 13:41.792
Daemonfeuer.

13:44.356 --> 13:46.700
You sure we should be
conversing like this here?

13:49.128 --> 13:51.438
I was hoping you'd say that O.

14:01.273 --> 14:04.152
So, Daemonfeuer? You just said we
weren't going to do that in here!

14:07.947 --> 14:08.982
Okay.

14:11.517 --> 14:12.894
I really don't know
that much about them.

14:12.952 --> 14:14.989
There's not that many
of them around anymore.

14:15.621 --> 14:17.760
They're kind of a throwback
to the days of yore.

14:17.823 --> 14:19.302
You know? Knights in shining armor.

14:19.358 --> 14:22.362
From my understanding,
they come from a dragon-like lineage.

14:23.062 --> 14:25.201
Uh, I thought dragons
were mythological.

14:25.264 --> 14:26.265
Dragons are.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.038
Daemonfeuers aren't.

14:30.269 --> 14:31.907
Well, so, can they breathe fire?

14:33.272 --> 14:35.718
Well, in an obtuse way,
I guess they can. Yeah.

14:36.308 --> 14:39.812
I mean, from my understanding, and I'm
telling you, I'm not an expert on this,

14:39.979 --> 14:42.118
it's a kind of ketonic...

14:42.815 --> 14:45.159
What's the word I'm
looking for? Vomit.

14:45.251 --> 14:47.754
Did you ever hear of the low-carb,
high-fat diet?

14:48.721 --> 14:51.964
It puts your body in a state of ketosis,
where it burns its own fat.

14:52.024 --> 14:54.504
In their case, they can
vaporize their own fat.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.665
Highly explosive and
kind of disgusting.

14:57.029 --> 14:59.270
Unless, of course, you're
dancing half-naked on a stage.

14:59.331 --> 15:00.537
Well, how do they ignite it?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.911
Static electricity
would be my guess.

15:03.435 --> 15:04.880
What did her father do?

15:06.305 --> 15:09.047
Well, he may have burned a
couple of guys to death.

15:09.108 --> 15:11.714
Ooh. Actually, that reminds me.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.351
I got a call from my
cousin Naydler, in Antwerp.

15:15.447 --> 15:17.723
Apparently, a Grimm was
found dead in a back alley

15:17.950 --> 15:20.328
off the Krijgsbaan
near the Schoonselhof.

15:20.386 --> 15:22.229
Which, I'm sure,
means nothing to you.

15:24.590 --> 15:25.694
When?

15:27.493 --> 15:28.733
Two days ago.

15:29.261 --> 15:32.538
He was decapitated.
And the head has not been found.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.202
Rumor has it, it was the Reapers.

15:35.267 --> 15:39.716
So, I'm thinking, you know,
you should watch yourself.

15:59.625 --> 16:02.128
I'm Detective Burkhardt.
I need to talk to you.

16:02.227 --> 16:03.228
Lucky me.

16:12.371 --> 16:15.409
I'm investigating an
arson-related homicide.

16:18.444 --> 16:20.856
I had that tattoo way
before the books came out.

16:26.485 --> 16:28.692
Am I your first Daemonfeuer?

16:29.288 --> 16:30.289
I hope so.

16:33.559 --> 16:35.038
You're my first Grimm.

16:36.762 --> 16:39.675
I was a little worried I
wouldn't get to see you again.

16:39.999 --> 16:43.970
Although I have to say,
you're not exactly what I expected.

16:44.370 --> 16:46.213
And what did you expect?

16:47.539 --> 16:49.382
Grimms are bad-asses.

16:49.508 --> 16:51.317
That's kind of a turn-on.

16:53.145 --> 16:55.216
Unless, of course,
you're going to cut off my head.

16:59.284 --> 17:02.788
I'm looking for your
father Fred Eberhart.

17:04.390 --> 17:05.664
You're not going to find him here.

17:05.958 --> 17:10.202
He's a suspect in an arson
investigation. Two men died.

17:11.497 --> 17:13.602
So, you figure, where there's smoke,
there's an Eberhart?

17:14.032 --> 17:16.205
Do you know where he is? No.

17:17.403 --> 17:18.905
When was the last time you saw him?

17:20.439 --> 17:23.079
My father is a bit of a
lost soul, Detective.

17:24.076 --> 17:28.047
After my mother passed away,
he fell apart.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.758
He blamed himself.

17:31.617 --> 17:34.757
Maybe he should have.
He didn't protect her.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.159
Anyway, he couldn't
handle anything.

17:37.456 --> 17:38.958
Especially me.

17:39.558 --> 17:42.835
I kind of lost both
parents at the same time.

17:47.199 --> 17:49.907
Does he have any friends
who might know where he is?

17:49.968 --> 17:52.448
I wouldn't know I wish I did.

17:52.838 --> 17:54.909
Sometimes, I really miss him.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.047
Are you sure it was him?

18:00.112 --> 18:01.284
Yeah.

18:02.748 --> 18:05.422
So, you want to put my father in prison,
and you want me to help.

18:05.551 --> 18:09.021
I want to stop him.
Before he hurts someone else.

18:12.524 --> 18:14.026
So should you.

20:23.689 --> 20:25.600
Wow. And I thought I was hot.

20:27.326 --> 20:29.533
Okay. Just wait a minute here.

20:30.028 --> 20:31.735
No, I'm glad you stopped by.

20:31.797 --> 20:33.777
Next time,
try using the front door.

20:34.266 --> 20:36.212
Oh, I just saw something
in your backyard.

20:36.268 --> 20:39.078
You did. I was doing
a little purging.

20:45.944 --> 20:47.582
Hello. Nick's phone.
What do you want?

20:48.080 --> 20:49.320
Who is this?

20:49.381 --> 20:51.327
Uh, this is a friend of Nick's.
Who's this?

20:51.383 --> 20:52.453
Give me the phone.

20:52.618 --> 20:55.030
Where is Nick?
He's right here with me.

20:55.387 --> 20:58.231
Hey. Take it easy, baby.
Oh, that kind of feels good.

20:58.290 --> 21:00.292
Uh, which one's Juliette?

21:00.859 --> 21:04.136
Juliette? I can explain.
Oh, good. I can't wait.

21:12.204 --> 21:14.582
Oh, you're not leaving
so soon, are you?

21:14.773 --> 21:16.684
After you came all this way?

21:17.342 --> 21:19.652
I hope you're not
some kind of a tease.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.990
Remember, Nick. You came for me.

21:24.383 --> 21:26.363
I didn't come for you.

21:27.486 --> 21:28.965
Why wasn't Hank with you?

21:29.054 --> 21:30.795
Because he went home.

21:30.989 --> 21:32.696
All right? I told him I'd
follow up on a number,

21:32.758 --> 21:34.704
which led me to the club.
Which led me to her,

21:34.760 --> 21:37.366
which led me to her house.
And Juliette, she's...

21:37.429 --> 21:39.375
I mean, she's crazy.

21:39.498 --> 21:41.068
How did she get your phone?

21:41.566 --> 21:43.773
It fell out of my
pocket in the backyard.

21:43.835 --> 21:46.509
Hmm. So, it just jumped
out into her hands?

21:46.571 --> 21:47.845
Oh, stop.

21:48.807 --> 21:51.413
No, that is... I know where you're going,
and that is not what happened.

21:53.745 --> 21:55.349
Okay, I was hit.

21:55.447 --> 21:57.154
She hit you? Yeah.

21:58.016 --> 22:00.587
Why didn't you arrest her
for assaulting an officer?

22:00.652 --> 22:04.065
Because I'm trying to get
her to help me find her dad.

22:04.656 --> 22:08.695
What does this girl do besides
hitting young men in her back yard?

22:11.596 --> 22:13.633
Well, she's a fire dancer.

22:13.699 --> 22:17.772
Juliette, listen. I could not
make this up if I wanted to.

22:22.274 --> 22:23.912
I'm really sorry.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.519
I hope so.

22:26.812 --> 22:29.554
I would never do anything
like that to you.

22:29.648 --> 22:32.993
Then make sure you keep
your phone in your pocket.

22:51.103 --> 22:54.084
"His children were even more
fierce than the Daemonfeuer.

22:55.006 --> 22:57.509
"Willing to sacrifice
themselves for him.

22:58.243 --> 23:01.281
"We avoided them and followed the
Daemonfeuer high into the mountains,

23:01.346 --> 23:04.054
"where we discovered
his terrible lair,

23:04.149 --> 23:07.722
"filled with treasures
stolen from all the villages.

23:07.786 --> 23:10.960
"The bones at the entrance of
the cave were too many to count.

23:11.022 --> 23:15.732
"If we did not know better, we would have
guessed it was the entrance to Hell."

23:18.430 --> 23:21.707
That's just what I need.
An entrance to Hell.

23:45.290 --> 23:47.497
It's going to be okay, Daddy.

23:47.759 --> 23:50.797
I found someone who's
going to make you better.

23:54.232 --> 23:56.838
Eberhart was one of the
best welders we had.

23:56.902 --> 23:58.404
Learned in the military.

23:58.470 --> 24:01.940
Told me his old man handled
a flamethrower in Vietnam,

24:02.007 --> 24:04.112
and his grandfather used
one in the South Pacific.

24:04.176 --> 24:05.246
He was pretty proud of that.

24:05.310 --> 24:06.755
When was the last time you saw him?

24:06.812 --> 24:09.019
It was a couple of weeks ago.

24:10.949 --> 24:13.327
I tried to talk to him,
but he ran off.

24:13.385 --> 24:17.527
He's gone crazy. You know,
his wife died in a fire,

24:17.989 --> 24:19.730
and he was never the
same after that.

24:19.791 --> 24:21.361
Just stopped showing up.

24:21.426 --> 24:23.497
I felt bad for him,
but what could I do?

24:23.995 --> 24:26.168
Where was he when you saw him last?

24:26.264 --> 24:28.505
He was over by an old
line we don't use anymore.

24:28.567 --> 24:30.171
It's an old, uh, mining spur.

24:30.435 --> 24:32.415
You see where he came from or went?

24:32.704 --> 24:35.742
No. He was just walking
down the tracks.

24:48.053 --> 24:49.327
I got it.

24:50.055 --> 24:53.593
It's a map from 1945 showing
all the old rail lines.

24:53.758 --> 24:56.034
This is the old rail
station right there.

24:56.094 --> 24:57.801
And this is the spur line
he was talking about.

24:57.863 --> 24:59.399
It goes right up into the hills.

24:59.464 --> 25:00.875
Branches off into four tracks.

25:00.932 --> 25:03.173
A what? Nice place for a lair?

25:04.336 --> 25:07.215
You know, a good place
to hide. Burkhardt.

25:07.739 --> 25:09.309
Hi. It's me.

25:10.275 --> 25:13.916
I'm putting on a special
show tonight. Just for you.

25:14.546 --> 25:15.854
Don't disappoint me.

25:15.914 --> 25:16.949
Listen to me.

25:17.115 --> 25:18.992
I know, Nick. You're taken.

25:19.484 --> 25:21.259
I'm just having fun.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.990
Listen, I've decided to
help you find my father.

25:25.824 --> 25:29.135
Come by my house tonight and
I'll tell you everything I know.

25:32.130 --> 25:33.438
Who was that?

25:34.366 --> 25:36.346
That was Ariel Eberhart.

25:36.935 --> 25:38.812
She says she wants to
help us find her dad.

25:38.970 --> 25:40.381
How? I don't know.

25:40.605 --> 25:42.607
She said she wants me to
stop by her house tonight.

25:42.674 --> 25:43.914
Really?

25:44.676 --> 25:47.850
You sure she's not playing a
little badge bunny with you?

25:48.513 --> 25:51.255
All I know is you're
coming with me.

25:53.451 --> 25:54.521
Hi. Hi.

25:55.253 --> 25:57.961
Okay, I'm going to be right upfront.
I'm going to be late.

25:58.023 --> 26:01.027
The investigation is taking us
back to the fire dancer's house.

26:01.092 --> 26:02.765
And I do mean "us."

26:02.827 --> 26:04.067
Hank's coming with me.

26:04.129 --> 26:05.130
Tell her, Hank. I'm going with him.

26:06.698 --> 26:07.699
Okay?

26:07.766 --> 26:09.939
Okay, okay, I get it. I trust you.

26:10.101 --> 26:12.911
Maybe I'll be waiting for
you when you get home.

26:13.171 --> 26:15.151
Have a little fire
dance of our own.

26:16.374 --> 26:18.081
Yeah. Can't wait.

26:31.489 --> 26:35.301
Ooh, man. This place
must be fun in a storm.

26:47.672 --> 26:49.447
Detectives Burkhardt and Griffin.

26:54.179 --> 26:56.523
If her father knew she was
trying to help us find him...

26:56.581 --> 26:58.356
Yeah, her life could be in danger.

26:58.416 --> 27:00.418
That's what I'm thinking.

27:21.039 --> 27:22.541
What the hell?

27:24.542 --> 27:26.351
It's all copper.

27:27.278 --> 27:31.693
Why? I mean, I had an aunt who
wore tinfoil hats for years.

27:31.883 --> 27:33.556
But this... Jeez.

27:45.030 --> 27:48.534
This girl takes being wired
to a whole new level.

27:59.477 --> 28:02.651
So. Where is she?

28:07.919 --> 28:09.455
You hear that?

28:09.721 --> 28:12.895
Yeah. I think it's
time for us to...

28:12.957 --> 28:14.630
Get the hell out.

28:22.167 --> 28:24.204
About all we can do is
run an APB on her car.

28:24.269 --> 28:26.215
See if we can pick her up.

28:26.271 --> 28:28.945
Until then, you might as well
go home and get a little.

28:29.007 --> 28:30.111
Rest.

29:18.890 --> 29:20.927
Where you going, baby?

29:27.398 --> 29:28.604
Where's Juliette?

29:28.666 --> 29:30.304
What do you care?
You've got me now.

29:30.502 --> 29:32.573
I'm asking you one last time.

29:32.637 --> 29:35.140
Ooh. Knight in shining armor.

29:36.941 --> 29:38.511
Where is she?

30:15.146 --> 30:16.420
Juliette, where are you?

30:16.481 --> 30:20.122
She's with me. Time for a
little search and rescue.

30:20.552 --> 30:22.122
Where are you taking her?

30:22.187 --> 30:24.793
Oh, come on, Nick.
Where do you think?

30:25.757 --> 30:28.363
You know who we are.
You know what we do.

30:28.860 --> 30:30.464
What do you want?

30:30.528 --> 30:33.304
I'd lost hope of being
able to help my father.

30:33.364 --> 30:35.037
Until I found you.

30:35.500 --> 30:38.106
Offering my father a
chance at redemption.

30:38.169 --> 30:41.048
Now, Grimm up. It's time
to face your Daemonfeuer.

30:41.639 --> 30:44.017
Oh. And if you want to
see her alive again...

30:44.576 --> 30:45.816
No cops.

30:57.822 --> 31:02.293
My guess? "Meet your Daemonfeuer" means,
you know, "See you at the lair."

31:02.527 --> 31:04.370
And according to this map,

31:04.495 --> 31:08.841
the third track goes into a tunnel.
Which would be perfect.

31:09.534 --> 31:12.777
Dude. You know what she's doing?

31:12.937 --> 31:14.075
You know what this is all about?

31:14.639 --> 31:16.778
I can't believe I didn't
see it before. What?

31:16.841 --> 31:18.343
It is so classic. What?

31:18.443 --> 31:19.717
The quest.

31:19.844 --> 31:22.882
Your princess has been
taken by the dragon, right?

31:23.214 --> 31:25.285
And the rest is obvious, you know?

31:25.350 --> 31:29.230
Beautiful women being taken,
dragged into caves,

31:29.287 --> 31:32.393
and the men sacrificing
everything to go after them.

31:32.457 --> 31:36.462
It is the ancient archetype of
the whole relationship megillah.

31:39.764 --> 31:42.540
Only problem is,
somebody always dies.

32:18.536 --> 32:20.311
That's Juliette's car.

32:21.639 --> 32:24.381
It looks like the tunnel is
all the way down those tracks.

32:24.442 --> 32:26.183
That's a long walk.

32:28.379 --> 32:30.017
Oh, there's got to
be a quicker way.

32:31.616 --> 32:32.788
What about that?

32:32.850 --> 32:35.558
Hell, yeah. That's a
Fairmont section car, man.

32:36.387 --> 32:38.458
A draisine. Any idea how it works?

32:38.756 --> 32:41.100
I haven't been a model train collector
all these years for nothing.

32:41.159 --> 32:43.002
All right.

32:44.862 --> 32:48.935
Now. Just so you know, Baron Karl
Christian Ludwig Drais von Sauerbrohn

32:49.434 --> 32:54.281
invented the precursor to this,
called a Laufmaschine, in 1817.

32:54.339 --> 32:55.750
So, you should know that.

32:55.807 --> 32:56.979
Great.

32:57.075 --> 32:58.554
Come on, baby.

33:03.181 --> 33:05.127
Oh, yeah.

33:05.183 --> 33:06.924
Come on. All right.

33:11.422 --> 33:12.901
Now, hold on.

33:14.459 --> 33:16.837
Whoa! Whoops. Sorry about that.

33:16.894 --> 33:18.271
Here we go.

33:42.887 --> 33:45.925
Hey, I'm just glad I could
be here to, you know,

33:46.491 --> 33:48.835
help rescue a woman
I've never met before.

33:49.360 --> 33:53.240
Or been introduced to. But you know,
hey, I don't take it personally.

33:53.297 --> 33:55.504
It's just... Are you really going
to bring that up right now?

33:55.566 --> 33:57.045
No, I know. I know.
I'm just a little nervous.

33:57.101 --> 33:59.172
You know, these are
Daemonfeuers, after all.

33:59.404 --> 34:03.614
I know you have a plan. It's just,
you know, you haven't shared it with me.

34:03.674 --> 34:04.744
Yet.

34:06.778 --> 34:08.416
Oh, dear God.

34:18.022 --> 34:19.501
Dad, wake up.

34:21.292 --> 34:22.929
I've brought her.

34:23.860 --> 34:25.362
She's here. Waiting for you.

34:26.330 --> 34:29.174
She's just like Mom
Now's your chance.

34:43.481 --> 34:45.324
Isn't she perfect?

34:51.889 --> 34:54.665
Who... Who comes for her?

34:55.560 --> 34:57.437
Someone worthy of you.

35:04.869 --> 35:06.644
Now, we better stop here.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.494
So, what are we going to do?

35:20.785 --> 35:24.198
I mean, you can't use your gun in there.
You know, with them breathing all that gas.

35:24.255 --> 35:26.667
Ah, it's too bad you
don't have a lance.

35:26.724 --> 35:28.294
I bet you've got one
back in the trailer.

35:28.359 --> 35:30.896
I'm giving them what they want. Me.

35:32.330 --> 35:34.367
I'm not liking the plan so far.

35:34.732 --> 35:37.872
I'm going to distract them long
enough for you to get Juliette.

35:37.935 --> 35:39.312
Well, what if I can't find her?

35:39.370 --> 35:41.543
What if I get burned alive?

35:41.973 --> 35:44.214
We're going in, no matter what.

35:44.609 --> 35:48.216
Okay. No. I got it. Just stay
in the present, not the future.

36:23.981 --> 36:27.519
Ariel? I'm here!

36:39.830 --> 36:41.070
Juliette?

36:47.004 --> 36:48.210
Ariel?

36:59.717 --> 37:02.664
Ariel, think about
what you're doing!

37:17.602 --> 37:20.640
He's coming for Mom.
You have to protect Mom.

37:36.087 --> 37:37.157
Shh!

37:41.726 --> 37:44.070
I'm here to help. You're Juliette.

37:44.295 --> 37:47.037
We've never been introduced,
but I'm a friend of Nick's.

37:47.098 --> 37:49.169
Give me your hands.

37:54.805 --> 37:56.182
Don't move.

38:16.594 --> 38:18.505
Time for you to scream.

38:18.829 --> 38:20.240
Time for you to scream.

38:24.368 --> 38:27.144
We've got to get out
of here now. Come on.

38:27.271 --> 38:28.306
Okay. Follow me.

39:41.379 --> 39:44.849
Dad! You fought valiantly, Daddy.

39:45.182 --> 39:46.422
You did.

39:55.493 --> 39:57.234
I got her, Nick!

39:57.294 --> 39:59.205
We're out!

40:03.734 --> 40:05.509
You didn't help him.

40:06.003 --> 40:08.813
But you did. He died with dignity.

40:10.775 --> 40:12.652
Now, it's my turn.

40:12.810 --> 40:14.847
Ariel.

40:15.579 --> 40:16.649
Don't.

40:25.222 --> 40:27.202
Father of fire, fierce and wise,

40:27.258 --> 40:30.034
dragon blood shall once more rise.
Dragon blood...

40:30.694 --> 40:31.968
Nick!

40:32.096 --> 40:34.542
Avenge thine father
by dragon's fire.

40:35.833 --> 40:37.506
Are you okay?

40:38.269 --> 40:39.407
Mmm.

40:39.937 --> 40:41.245
Are you okay? Yeah, I think so.

40:41.305 --> 40:43.376
That was a little close
for comfort, man.

40:43.908 --> 40:45.114
Thanks.

40:50.448 --> 40:53.156
This is Detective Burkhardt.
I'm at the end of the old rail line...

40:53.217 --> 40:55.356
Are you a detective, too?

40:55.653 --> 40:59.965
More of a private investigator.
Friend of Nick's.

41:01.392 --> 41:04.236
I'm Monroe, by the way.
It's nice to meet you.

41:07.231 --> 41:08.505
You, too.

41:25.149 --> 41:26.924
Nick, pull over.

41:40.698 --> 41:41.972
You okay?

41:45.102 --> 41:49.778
Look, Juliette, I'm sorry.
I didn't want this to happen.

41:53.110 --> 41:58.617
Look, if I... I had
any way of knowing...

41:59.216 --> 42:01.787
Nick, she was crazy.
How could you ever know

42:01.852 --> 42:03.729
what somebody like
that is going to do?

42:03.787 --> 42:06.495
Well, I can't promise it's
going to get any better.

42:07.958 --> 42:10.837
I can't promise I
can keep doing this.

42:16.200 --> 42:17.838
I know you love Juliette.

42:18.702 --> 42:20.613
But you have to end it
and never see her again.

42:24.875 --> 42:27.048
What do you want to do?

42:30.147 --> 42:33.219
All I know is that I'm too
tired to talk about it tonight.

42:33.984 --> 42:35.725
Let's just go home.

42:39.857 --> 42:42.133
I'm just glad that bitch is dead.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
