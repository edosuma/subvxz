02:01.040 --> 02:04.544
- What's this?
- Hey! Off the car!

02:05.712 --> 02:07.697
Kids!

02:07.697 --> 02:11.088
I said get off the car!

02:20.368 --> 02:22.801
No.

03:59.570 --> 04:01.490
Mr. Harris?
Detective Carver.

04:01.490 --> 04:02.929
- Brian Carver.
- How do you do?

04:02.929 --> 04:04.850
- This is my partner, Lewis Carnegie.
- And how do you do?

04:04.850 --> 04:06.290
- Nice to meet you.
- How was your flight?

04:06.290 --> 04:08.498
- Long.
- I hate flying.

04:08.498 --> 04:11.298
They pack you in like sardines
and half starve you.

04:11.298 --> 04:13.298
Upper class is usually okay.

04:13.298 --> 04:15.698
The car's this way, sir.

04:26.258 --> 04:28.658
- I'll put this in the back
for you, sir. - Thank you.

04:28.658 --> 04:30.578
- First time in London?
- Yes.

04:30.578 --> 04:32.643
I've been looking
forward to it.

04:32.643 --> 04:34.979
I hope we don't
disappoint you.

05:20.739 --> 05:23.619
Fucking animals.

05:23.619 --> 05:27.460
- Not exactly Hollywood,
is it, sir? - Not yet.

05:29.860 --> 05:34.131
Todo hace lo mismo.

05:34.131 --> 05:37.972
It's Spanish. It means
"Everything eventually becomes the same."

05:38.451 --> 05:40.852
Well, they teach you that
at Police Academy, do they?

05:40.852 --> 05:46.100
No. You pick it up
along the way. It helps.

05:46.100 --> 05:50.708
Yeah? Fuck me, Brian.
We'd better learn to speak Chinese, eh?

05:53.844 --> 05:56.276
Aw, paddy.

05:56.276 --> 05:58.195
Bollocks.

06:15.060 --> 06:16.500
- Thanks for the ride.
- No problem.

06:16.980 --> 06:19.860
Be all right, will you?
Stupid question, I suppose.

06:19.860 --> 06:22.484
If ever you want to change your life
with mine while you're here, just ask.

06:22.484 --> 06:25.204
It's the lobby. Hotels usually go
downhill from here.

06:25.204 --> 06:28.260
- I'll see you gentlemen in the morning.
- I'm looking forward to it.

06:42.259 --> 06:44.276
Thank you very much, sir.

07:08.772 --> 07:10.693
Hi, this is Sam Harris.

07:10.693 --> 07:12.613
<i>I can't get to the phone.
Leave a message, okay?</i>

07:12.997 --> 07:16.533
<i>Thanks. Bye.</i>

07:26.213 --> 07:30.693
Right. George Fletcher, a string
of previous convictions.

07:31.093 --> 07:34.213
Mostly armed robbery.
Served seven years.

07:34.213 --> 07:37.573
Came out in '87.
Teamed up with Curtis Payne.

07:37.573 --> 07:41.749
Between them they controlled a chain of
supply houses from Brixton to Greenwich.

07:42.133 --> 07:44.437
Mostly designer drugs.
Ecstasy. Crack.

07:44.437 --> 07:48.309
Probably one of the biggest
drug rings we've uncovered.

07:48.309 --> 07:52.917
Killed by automatic gunfire.
No known suspects.

07:52.917 --> 07:56.374
Roy England.
Minor drug-related convictions.

07:56.374 --> 07:59.446
Limehouse drug squad reckoned
he was expanding his operation.

07:59.446 --> 08:02.518
Died april the 12th.
Shot in the face, back and chest.

08:02.518 --> 08:04.838
No suspects.

08:06.757 --> 08:10.390
Frank Pierce. You all know him.
One of the old greats.

08:10.774 --> 08:13.846
Mayfair safety deposit job
back in '74.

08:16.150 --> 08:20.054
Very powerful. No recent record.
Just legitimate imports.

08:20.054 --> 08:23.750
Freight, trucking. No known
involvement in the drugs trade.

08:23.750 --> 08:27.943
Killed last wednesday with his
bodyguard. Messy killing.

08:27.943 --> 08:31.782
One shot to the head, five
to the body. Close range.

08:31.782 --> 08:36.470
No arrests, no leads, no sense.

08:38.006 --> 08:41.143
Obviously, there's a pattern.
They're not random targets.

08:41.143 --> 08:45.062
They're specific. In fact, if they
hadn't have been the victims,

08:45.062 --> 08:47.414
they'd have been
our first suspects.

08:47.414 --> 08:49.623
Any prints found at the scene
are new to us.

08:49.623 --> 08:51.927
- Maybe it's the Jamaicans moving in.
- Yeah, that's what we thought...

08:51.927 --> 08:54.615
'til they come to us...
for protection.

08:57.687 --> 09:00.343
The men are from all over
really. Mainly C.I.D.

09:00.343 --> 09:02.263
Detectives already linked with
the relevant investigations.

09:02.743 --> 09:05.143
The whole operation's being
coordinated from here.

09:05.143 --> 09:08.503
This is going to belong to a foreign bank
eventually. We've leased it for six months.

09:08.503 --> 09:10.903
They think we're with
The Inland Revenue.

09:10.903 --> 09:13.783
- It's all a secret then?
- Secret? No, it's not a secret.

09:14.263 --> 09:17.143
We just don't tell them what we're doing.
Mr. Harris, detective Foster.

09:17.143 --> 09:20.022
Special branch.
One of mine, actually.

09:20.022 --> 09:22.486
- Foster takes over when I'm not around.
- Pleased to meet you, Mr. Harris.

09:22.486 --> 09:24.951
How was the flight?

09:24.951 --> 09:28.854
- What's wrong? - I just didn't expect
everyone to be so polite.

09:28.854 --> 09:32.775
Well, I hope that doesn't have
to change. We're just down here.

09:36.615 --> 09:39.943
Good morning, gentlemen.

09:39.943 --> 09:42.342
Just a few moments of your time.
If I could have your attention...

09:42.342 --> 09:46.182
- Oh, good morning, Mr. Gray.
- Good morning. - How are you?

09:46.182 --> 09:49.544
This won't take too long.

09:49.544 --> 09:52.616
This is John Harris, who just flew
in yesterday from Los Angeles...

09:53.062 --> 09:54.983
to help us with our
investigation.

09:54.983 --> 09:57.863
Mr. Harris is a...
group leader...

09:58.295 --> 10:01.719
with the drug enforcement
administration.

10:01.719 --> 10:05.464
He has operational experience in New York
and more recently in Los Angeles.

10:05.464 --> 10:10.312
Over here, his principal capacity
is that of an... advisor.

10:10.312 --> 10:12.231
We're very lucky
to have him with us.

10:12.231 --> 10:15.223
He's a highly
decorated policeman.

10:15.223 --> 10:18.071
Would you like to say a
few words to the troops?

10:19.608 --> 10:21.863
I'm not going to say much.

10:21.863 --> 10:25.702
Excuse me.
I don't think I have to.

10:25.702 --> 10:29.672
As Mr. Donnelly said, I am here as an
advisor. I'm not here to get in your way.

10:31.607 --> 10:36.600
The D.E.A. is extremely experienced at
establishing a task-force environment.

10:36.984 --> 10:40.472
Getting everyone together like this,
exchanging needs, ideas...

10:40.472 --> 10:45.176
It gives everyone the opportunity to
focus clearly on the real problems.

10:45.176 --> 10:47.671
It also gives us a wider jurisdiction
when it comes to the arrests.

10:48.056 --> 10:49.208
And who are we going
to arrest exactly?

10:49.592 --> 10:51.927
Whoever's responsible for
what's going on here.

10:52.313 --> 10:56.152
And who's that? All we've got at the moment
is a bunch of dead villains. Nothing else.

10:56.152 --> 10:59.224
You're gonna have plenty of time to
talk about it, Carnegie.

10:59.224 --> 11:01.527
You and Carver are going to be
showing Mr. Harris around.

11:03.065 --> 11:06.696
Give me the keys.
I'm driving.

11:06.696 --> 11:09.096
So, what do you want
to see first, Mr. Harris?

11:09.096 --> 11:11.976
Frank Pierce's funeral.
That should be interesting.

11:11.976 --> 11:13.896
He won't be able
to tell you much.

11:14.377 --> 11:17.257
I'm sure there'll be a lot of
concerned friends present.

11:17.257 --> 11:21.097
Maybe not friends, just concerned.
I'd like to hear why.

11:21.097 --> 11:24.216
"I am the resurrection and
the life," said the Lord.

11:24.216 --> 11:28.536
"He that believeth in me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.

11:28.536 --> 11:31.417
"And whosoever liveth
and believeth in me..."

11:48.025 --> 11:51.096
Well. Real celebrity
turnout today.

11:51.096 --> 11:55.578
See the gray-haired geezer
there, shaking hands?

11:55.578 --> 11:57.225
You've got a real star there.

11:57.225 --> 12:01.337
Sidney Callow. One of the last
remaining good old boys.

12:01.785 --> 12:03.321
He was big in the 60's, early 70's.

12:03.706 --> 12:06.010
They treat him like
fucking royalty.

12:06.010 --> 12:09.177
- Another drug man?
- No, thanks.

12:09.177 --> 12:12.537
Callow's not into drugs
and never has been.

12:12.537 --> 12:14.937
No, protection.

12:14.937 --> 12:19.018
A good, old-fashioned gangster.
Made a fortune in prison.

12:19.018 --> 12:22.186
- Ran his own little empire, whitechapel
to bow. - Thanks for coming with us.

12:22.186 --> 12:26.393
They loved him. Was probably drugs
that put him out of business.

12:26.393 --> 12:30.218
It's a young man's poison.
It's a whole new world.

12:30.618 --> 12:33.306
these old boys,
I never could understand them.

12:35.226 --> 12:37.273
And now?

12:37.273 --> 12:40.794
- Moved out to the suburbs.
Croydon somewhere. - Yeah, Surrey.

12:40.794 --> 12:43.225
Who's the guy with the glasses?

12:43.225 --> 12:46.825
Jack Doyle. Nightclub owner.
Last person to see Frank alive.

12:46.825 --> 12:49.226
What did he have to say?

12:49.226 --> 12:53.179
- Came in himself as soon as he heard.
- Couldn't tell us anything.

12:56.537 --> 12:59.705
Sid!

12:59.705 --> 13:02.585
Lewis is over there.

13:02.585 --> 13:04.826
Hello, Lewis, Brian.

13:07.497 --> 13:10.650
- Wouldn't have thought you'd have bothered.
- I had no problems with Frank.

13:11.034 --> 13:12.570
Who's your friend?

13:12.570 --> 13:14.554
One of our colleagues
from across the Atlantic.

13:14.554 --> 13:16.474
Haven't we got
enough policemen?

13:16.474 --> 13:19.930
You read the papers. We've got their crime,
we may as well have their coppers.

13:19.930 --> 13:22.027
John Harris, Sidney Callow.

13:22.027 --> 13:24.955
I've been to the states
a couple of times.

13:24.955 --> 13:27.258
Disney World. I like it there.
The streets are spotless.

13:27.258 --> 13:30.107
They hire a lot of people
to pick up the garbage.

13:30.107 --> 13:32.827
- Where are you from?
- New York. You ever been there?

13:32.827 --> 13:34.361
No.

13:34.747 --> 13:37.818
I think you'd like it there.

13:39.466 --> 13:41.306
What's going on, Lewis?

13:41.306 --> 13:43.418
I thought you could tell me.

13:43.418 --> 13:46.106
Nobody knows a thing.
Believe me, I've asked.

13:46.106 --> 13:49.178
All I know is, nobody's
doing anything to stop it.

13:49.178 --> 13:51.098
Was Frank getting
into anything new?

13:51.098 --> 13:54.186
I don't think so.

13:54.186 --> 13:58.043
Maybe it was what he
wasn't getting into.

14:04.986 --> 14:08.170
If this goes on much longer, he's going
to be coming to us for protection.

14:08.555 --> 14:11.098
Come on, let's get out
of here. I'm starving.

15:13.084 --> 15:14.749
Don't worry, man.
Put your money away.

15:15.180 --> 15:17.388
- I got enough of it... it's all right.
- Put your money away.

15:17.388 --> 15:20.748
But this is what it's all about,
isn't it, Lionel? Money.

15:20.748 --> 15:22.668
Nothing else.

15:22.668 --> 15:26.140
Look, man, we don't take shit
anymore. We don't have to.

15:28.541 --> 15:30.748
- What are you trying to say?
- What am I trying to say?

15:30.748 --> 15:32.941
You don't get it, do ya?
You could have some of this.

15:33.420 --> 15:34.380
We know somebody.

15:34.380 --> 15:36.108
- Don't want to know, okay?
- Boy-oy-oy-oy!

15:36.588 --> 15:39.020
We're giving you
a chance, boy.

15:39.020 --> 15:41.964
What else have you got?
You got something better?

15:41.964 --> 15:45.532
- Or are you better than us? - You ain't
better. Same prick with a portable phone.

15:45.532 --> 15:48.028
You better watch what
you're saying, brother.

15:48.028 --> 15:51.996
- I ain't your brother.
- You ain't nothing, fuck!

15:53.710 --> 15:55.548
- Big man.
- Yes.

15:55.548 --> 15:57.853
Yeah, that's right!

15:57.853 --> 16:01.085
Now if you want some of this,
you're not gonna be the first.

16:02.780 --> 16:05.596
Let's go. Let's go, Lionel.
Come on.

16:05.981 --> 16:08.636
- Watch your backs, boys.
- Fuck off!

16:14.269 --> 16:18.029
Oh, something's going down.

16:18.029 --> 16:20.957
We've gotta take a look.
This is our neighborhood.

16:27.644 --> 16:30.909
Ah, it's just kids.

16:30.909 --> 16:33.789
- Stop the car!
- What?

16:33.789 --> 16:35.709
Oh, for Christ's sake!

16:38.878 --> 16:40.316
Step back, step back.

16:40.797 --> 16:42.718
- Leave him! Leave him!
- Who the hell are you?

16:42.718 --> 16:45.117
It's all right.
He's with us.

16:47.997 --> 16:50.877
Anybody call an ambulance?
Anybody call an ambulance?

16:50.877 --> 16:54.813
It'd be quicker to take him ourselves.
Barts is just five minutes away.

16:54.813 --> 16:58.509
Hold on.
Let's go.

16:58.990 --> 17:01.389
- Mr. Harris...
- Open the door!

17:01.389 --> 17:03.997
- Mr. Harris?
- What? Let him bleed to death?

17:03.997 --> 17:06.396
Watch your head.

17:08.030 --> 17:11.229
Bollocks.

17:11.229 --> 17:14.125
- What's your name?
- Christian O'Neill.

17:14.125 --> 17:16.718
Okay, Christian.

17:16.718 --> 17:19.037
- Keep your hand on the wound.
It'll stop... - Yeah, I know.

17:19.037 --> 17:22.943
What happened?

17:24.637 --> 17:27.037
You're Dermott's boy, aren't you?

17:27.037 --> 17:29.438
Whatever. You'll be spending
the night in jail.

17:43.581 --> 17:47.039
Just a minute.

17:58.478 --> 18:01.310
- Who is it?
- Carnegie.

18:02.751 --> 18:04.671
Don't tell me we woke
you up, detective?

18:04.671 --> 18:07.070
- What time is it?
- It's okay, we're early.

18:07.552 --> 18:09.710
Ohhh! Must be jet-lagged
or something.

18:09.710 --> 18:11.710
We thought you might like
to be on your own today.

18:12.190 --> 18:15.519
You know, take a look around.
Do some shopping.

18:15.583 --> 18:17.678
- Shopping?
- It's up to you, sir.

18:18.079 --> 18:21.055
We have to speak
to Jack Doyle again.

18:21.055 --> 18:22.750
He's the guy that owns
the nightclub, right?

18:23.135 --> 18:27.246
Yeah. Just a few loose
ends to tie up.

18:27.246 --> 18:31.359
I'd like to go along. Frank Pierce
was killed just around the corner.

18:31.359 --> 18:34.447
- I'd like to check out
the murder scene. - Fine.

18:34.447 --> 18:37.535
Sorry to rush you like this.

18:37.535 --> 18:39.663
Well, you're early.

18:39.663 --> 18:43.438
Computer wizard, are you, sir?

18:43.438 --> 18:45.663
I don't understand
them personally.

18:45.663 --> 18:47.999
- I leave all that stuff to my
six-year-old. - You have a son?

18:48.480 --> 18:51.103
- Lewis here has four
daughters. - Really?

18:51.487 --> 18:53.407
- You a family man?
- Mmm.

18:57.199 --> 19:00.543
- My daughter's 12 now.
- My son's 5.

19:00.543 --> 19:02.463
- Beautiful boy.
- Thank you.

19:04.800 --> 19:07.263
Oh, beautiful!

19:07.263 --> 19:10.320
I bet they love it out
there in California.

19:10.320 --> 19:13.008
They live with their mother
in New York.

19:26.048 --> 19:28.768
- Is this where it happened?
- Yeah, it's, uh...

19:28.768 --> 19:31.488
That's it. Just up there
beyond the bridge.

19:34.688 --> 19:36.399
See you later.

19:44.896 --> 19:47.392
- Jack?
- Upstairs.

19:55.456 --> 19:57.008
Bit early for that?

19:58.448 --> 20:01.024
I hear you're getting
married again, Dermott?

20:01.024 --> 20:03.360
It's none of your
fucking business.

20:04.704 --> 20:07.488
- I bumped into your
boy last night. - Where?

20:07.872 --> 20:10.176
None of your fucking business.

20:45.649 --> 20:47.425
- Busy, Jack?
- Business meeting.

20:47.809 --> 20:50.113
- Anyone I know?
- I doubt it.

20:50.497 --> 20:52.801
I hear you've, uh,
been busy down there?

20:52.801 --> 20:55.489
Just work, Jack.
Just work.

20:59.169 --> 21:01.217
Good boy, Jack.

21:21.249 --> 21:23.649
Come on, let's go.

21:23.649 --> 21:26.417
Here, let me do the driving.

21:26.417 --> 21:29.378
Huh! Give me the keys,
will you?

21:29.378 --> 21:30.913
Come on.

21:48.770 --> 21:53.762
- Do you think he's
onto something? - Nah.

21:53.762 --> 21:56.498
I'll bet he earns a packet.

21:56.882 --> 21:59.586
More than us, that's for sure.

21:59.586 --> 22:01.634
Thank god for our friends
in lowly pl...

22:06.690 --> 22:09.074
Oh, no.

22:14.178 --> 22:16.018
Hey!

22:38.019 --> 22:40.499
My god!

22:48.771 --> 22:51.427
Are you okay?

22:51.427 --> 22:54.307
They're not here, and
none of these faces fit.

22:54.787 --> 22:57.633
- Can I get an artist's
impression? - You'll get it.

22:57.633 --> 22:59.699
I have to talk to the press.

22:59.699 --> 23:02.339
What are you gonna tell them?

23:02.339 --> 23:05.059
I'll tell them that Carnegie and Carver
were two of the best men I had.

23:05.443 --> 23:08.899
- Is that what you really think?
- They were good policemen.

23:11.699 --> 23:13.443
You're two faggots!
You're ugly!

23:13.443 --> 23:14.595
Let him go!

23:14.595 --> 23:17.746
Calm down.
Cool. Cool.

23:22.020 --> 23:24.771
- What did they say?
- Nothing.

23:24.771 --> 23:26.690
It's not them, is it?

23:27.075 --> 23:30.563
I don't know.
I want to talk to the boy.

23:30.947 --> 23:34.147
- Carnegie's arrest from
the nightclub. - Why?

23:34.147 --> 23:36.515
He probably knows more than
all of us put together.

23:36.515 --> 23:38.436
As long as that's
okay with you.

23:51.076 --> 23:53.379
Mind if I show you something?

23:53.379 --> 23:56.067
Do I have any choice?

24:00.291 --> 24:02.500
You recognize him?

24:02.500 --> 24:06.435
- No. - I think he helped
kill two police officers.

24:06.820 --> 24:09.891
He threw a fire bomb
into their car.

24:09.891 --> 24:12.964
They burned to death.

24:15.651 --> 24:18.724
Why would he want to
do that, Chris?

24:20.260 --> 24:22.948
All right, play it your way.

24:22.948 --> 24:26.020
I hear you haven't spoken to anyone
since your arrest. Do you like it here?

24:26.020 --> 24:29.476
- I've seen worse. - If I were you,
I'd get myself an attorney.

24:29.860 --> 24:32.164
Assault.
Resisting arrest.

24:33.700 --> 24:37.540
Who's to say you didn't stick
the knife into your pal?

24:37.540 --> 24:39.844
Who did then? Who?

24:50.132 --> 24:52.453
You know who did it,
don't you?

24:57.061 --> 24:59.749
How's Lionel?

24:59.749 --> 25:03.972
Lionel's in very bad shape.
He might not make it.

25:05.893 --> 25:07.813
I want to see him.

25:07.813 --> 25:12.132
Help me out, Chris, and I'll
make sure that you see him.

25:25.749 --> 25:29.093
Check him out.

25:29.093 --> 25:30.630
Okay, he's clean.

25:30.630 --> 25:34.181
- What did he say? - He knows who they are.
He's gonna point them out to me.

25:34.181 --> 25:37.508
- Really? - Yeah. I think
I'll recognize them.

25:39.189 --> 25:43.397
I've got the boy's confidence,
so why don't you let me run with it?

25:44.645 --> 25:46.597
- What do you say?
- Okay.

25:46.597 --> 25:49.637
But we have to do it properly.
I still need to do my job.

25:49.637 --> 25:53.349
- Fine. So do it.
- Still an "advisor," Mr. Harris?

27:06.789 --> 27:09.669
You know what I mean?

27:09.669 --> 27:11.590
Who the fuck's this?

27:12.070 --> 27:14.950
- You're both under arrest.
- We're fucking what?

27:15.430 --> 27:18.310
Fuck!

27:18.310 --> 27:21.190
Freddy, run!

27:42.710 --> 27:45.638
I just don't believe this.
It's assault!

27:45.638 --> 27:47.543
Oh, you want to press charges,
do you? Right.

27:47.543 --> 27:50.535
- Somebody hit you over the head with
a bottle, did they? - Well, look at me!

27:50.535 --> 27:52.152
Who was it?
The American?

27:52.584 --> 27:54.903
Oh, come on now.
Who was it, your mate?

27:54.903 --> 27:57.432
Oh, right! Your mate hit you over
the head with a bottle, did he?

27:57.831 --> 27:59.382
Nice mates.

27:59.382 --> 28:01.543
That'll add grievous bodily harm
to everything else.

28:01.543 --> 28:03.464
Fuck off!

28:05.142 --> 28:07.912
This is just going to go on
and on until we're satisfied.

28:07.912 --> 28:10.231
Are you listening?

28:10.231 --> 28:14.711
Two of my policemen are dead, and we
have people who saw you at the scene.

28:14.711 --> 28:18.086
Bollocks! This ain't even
a police station.

28:19.624 --> 28:23.703
Look, either charge me
or let me go.

28:23.703 --> 28:25.862
How old are you? Eighteen, right?
Look it up.

28:25.862 --> 28:28.936
Prison. your life's over.
Is that what you want?

28:28.936 --> 28:31.671
- How long have you been doing this job, man?
- Who's your American friend?

28:32.120 --> 28:34.054
I don't know any
fucking Americans!

28:34.440 --> 28:38.664
You're a terrible liar, Dwayne.
You know plenty of Americans.

28:39.047 --> 28:41.735
What about Michael Jackson?
Mickey Mouse?

28:41.735 --> 28:45.192
Thomas Nuefeld?
Joseph Hernandez?

28:45.192 --> 28:47.880
Carl Fraser?

28:47.880 --> 28:51.335
Is that the name
he's using now?

28:51.720 --> 28:55.272
He's changed names more times than
you've changed your underwear, Dwayne.

28:55.657 --> 28:57.704
Fuck off!

28:57.704 --> 29:01.447
You curse me or my friend one more time
and I'll tear your fucking jaw off!

29:01.447 --> 29:03.368
Got it?

29:03.753 --> 29:06.824
He's using you.
It's what he does.

29:06.824 --> 29:09.513
But you're so full of shit
you can't even see it, can you?

29:09.513 --> 29:11.817
Can you?

29:15.704 --> 29:18.984
- They're just kids.
- That's where it starts.

29:23.976 --> 29:27.433
We can't detain them any longer unless
we can make a positive identification.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.031
What's all this
about an American?

29:29.031 --> 29:32.520
Drop them back home in squad cars
and make sure everyone sees them.

29:32.905 --> 29:34.665
I want the entire neighborhood
to know we busted them.

29:34.665 --> 29:37.897
- Is that an order?
- It's police work.

29:39.257 --> 29:41.225
Maybe we should just
give you a gun...

29:41.225 --> 29:43.528
-and let you clear out this
whole town for us. - Maybe.

29:43.528 --> 29:47.016
Who is it, Harris?
Who are you after?

29:47.016 --> 29:49.817
I knew we couldn't have
been paying for this.

29:49.817 --> 29:52.553
We can't even afford to convict
half the criminals we do catch.

29:52.553 --> 29:55.240
American money buys you more.

29:55.240 --> 29:57.928
In case you didn't realize it,
our aims are the same.

29:57.928 --> 30:01.386
Keeping things from me
doesn't help.

30:04.313 --> 30:07.240
Can't you get enough of this place?
I thought I'd pick up my wages.

30:07.624 --> 30:11.354
Fair enough. You look like shit.
Haven't you been to bed all night?

30:11.354 --> 30:15.082
See you monday. Do yourself a favor,
get some sleep.

33:05.068 --> 33:07.308
No!

33:29.995 --> 33:32.140
You all right?

33:34.508 --> 33:37.245
- Hi, stranger.
- How you doing, Rachael?

33:37.245 --> 33:40.237
Just come to see
my favorite cousin.

33:40.237 --> 33:44.077
- I've got to get back to work
soon, all right? - Okay.

33:44.077 --> 33:46.732
And how are you doing?

33:48.269 --> 33:49.804
Good.

33:52.876 --> 33:56.668
We'll be moving you down to surgery
soon. Don't be long, please.

33:58.988 --> 34:00.908
Surgery?

34:02.444 --> 34:04.876
They're operating again?

34:09.275 --> 34:13.228
Listen, it's no problem.
It'll be all right, man. Hear?

34:13.228 --> 34:16.109
Come here.

34:18.126 --> 34:20.045
She likes you.

34:20.045 --> 34:22.348
You didn't tell me
she'd be here.

34:22.348 --> 34:25.469
- Coincidence.
- Yeah, right.

34:25.469 --> 34:27.388
You're a coward, O'Neill.

34:27.388 --> 34:29.309
Talk about me when
I've gone, all right?

34:39.837 --> 34:42.349
Okay, Lionel, how
are you feeling?

34:42.349 --> 34:43.755
- Fine.
- Good.

34:44.188 --> 34:47.069
This is more like it, eh?

35:09.677 --> 35:12.077
Wait a minute.
Wait, please.

35:12.077 --> 35:14.189
Chris!

35:14.189 --> 35:16.525
Lie down, please.

35:27.629 --> 35:30.317
Hello?

35:30.317 --> 35:34.190
- Who are you? - You must want Sam.
I'll...  I'll go get her.

35:36.109 --> 35:38.093
Hello?
John?

35:38.093 --> 35:41.758
- Who was that? - It's Barnaby.
He lives across the street.

35:41.758 --> 35:44.558
He looks after the kids
for me sometimes.

35:44.558 --> 35:47.663
- Barnaby?
- The kids like him, okay?

35:47.663 --> 35:51.885
- Barnaby. - Look, John,
don't start, all right? Jesus.

35:51.885 --> 35:55.343
- What time is it over there?
- It's late. Why?

35:55.343 --> 35:58.030
- Why aren't the kids in bed?
- They are in bed.

35:58.030 --> 36:01.486
Yeah? Well, if the kids are in bed,
what's Barnaby doing there?

36:01.486 --> 36:05.710
If you're gonna be like this, I'm just
gonna hang up. I'm gonna go to bed.

36:06.094 --> 36:09.166
Alone?

36:14.990 --> 36:16.910
Come on, hit him!

36:26.479 --> 36:29.359
Kenneth!
Through with it!

36:29.838 --> 36:31.567
Points!

36:32.351 --> 36:34.271
It's not exactly salubrious.

36:34.271 --> 36:38.078
- Seat yourself down.
- Thanks.

36:38.078 --> 36:41.166
I hope you're not going to ask me who
blew up your friends, Mr. Harris.

36:41.550 --> 36:44.815
What do you take me for, a cop?

36:44.815 --> 36:47.887
- You'd tell me if you knew anything.
- Is that right?

36:47.887 --> 36:50.479
I read your record.

36:52.399 --> 36:54.734
You've had your fair share
of enemies.

36:54.734 --> 36:58.575
I'd rather just watch
a good fight these days.

36:58.575 --> 37:01.263
If the kids want to fight,
then let them do it... properly.

37:01.647 --> 37:03.951
Give them some rules.
Make it fair.

37:03.951 --> 37:06.511
There's no respect these days.

37:06.511 --> 37:09.711
The kids don't steal because they have to,
they steal because they want to.

37:09.711 --> 37:13.967
- Tell me about Jack Doyle. - What?
Did he kill Carnegie and Carver?

37:13.967 --> 37:16.399
- I doubt it.
- Get into him!

37:16.399 --> 37:20.239
Doyle's just an angry young man who
believes everything he sees in movies.

37:20.239 --> 37:23.311
- American movies.
- Is that right?

37:23.311 --> 37:26.800
- Oh, for fuck's sake!
- You see that young paddy there?

37:26.800 --> 37:28.559
Him in the blue.

37:29.040 --> 37:31.439
- Come on! - We have ourselves a little
lightweight contender there.

37:31.439 --> 37:33.071
Stick him!
Come on, stick him!

37:33.071 --> 37:36.591
- His trainer doesn't seem to think so.
- No, that's his father.

37:36.591 --> 37:38.351
Come on, bring the glove down!

37:38.351 --> 37:41.903
At least he knows where his kid is at night.
Might even make something out of him.

37:42.288 --> 37:44.079
Come on, move!
Turn it!

37:51.072 --> 37:53.232
- You can reach me tomorrow.
- Okay, good-bye.

38:01.872 --> 38:05.712
I'll see you tomorrow morning
at 8:00. Good-bye.

38:08.480 --> 38:10.880
- You all right?
- Jesus!

38:10.880 --> 38:12.800
- I thought you were going to
mug me. - I was just passing.

38:12.800 --> 38:14.240
No, you weren't.

38:14.720 --> 38:16.752
I was. I've been doing
some shopping.

38:17.200 --> 38:21.264
Mmm. How long have you
been waiting over here?

38:25.712 --> 38:29.553
48 minutes. What were you
talking about?

38:29.553 --> 38:31.856
Well, people like you give
us a lot to talk about.

38:31.856 --> 38:34.352
Would you like to go
to a wedding?

38:34.737 --> 38:38.001
Yeah.

38:38.001 --> 38:40.913
- All right. Whose is it?
- My dad's.

38:42.833 --> 38:46.001
Lionel's right.
You are weird.

38:46.001 --> 38:48.641
Look, the last time we went out I was
the only one who showed up.

38:48.913 --> 38:50.721
It won't happen this time.

38:50.721 --> 38:53.297
- How do I know that?
- I'm best man.

38:53.729 --> 38:55.649
Oh.

39:23.489 --> 39:25.889
- How ya doin', boys?
- All right, Mr. Fraser.

39:25.889 --> 39:27.793
All right, Mr. Fraser.

39:27.793 --> 39:31.697
We didn't say nothing. They didn't get
a word out of us. That's the truth.

39:31.697 --> 39:33.617
I wouldn't lie to you, man.

39:33.617 --> 39:35.697
- I know.
- They didn't get nothin'.

39:35.697 --> 39:37.617
- Nothin'.
- Of course they didn't.

39:37.617 --> 39:40.306
You're good boys,
both of youse.

39:43.410 --> 39:48.018
I used to live in a neighborhood
like this. A fucking sewer.

39:49.553 --> 39:54.162
People treating you like shit.
Nothing but trouble.

39:54.545 --> 39:57.010
- Isn't that right?
- Yeah.

39:57.394 --> 39:59.506
Every city in the world's
got a place like this,

39:59.506 --> 40:02.962
people like us.

40:02.962 --> 40:07.666
I'll tell you one thing,
I'm not going back.

40:10.402 --> 40:12.322
What about you fellows?

40:12.802 --> 40:16.801
Huh? You want out
of this place?

40:16.801 --> 40:19.330
- Yeah. - Want to really make
something out of your lives?

40:19.330 --> 40:22.099
Huh?

40:22.099 --> 40:24.787
You want to be somebody?

40:24.787 --> 40:26.642
- Yeah.
- Yeah, man.

40:26.642 --> 40:29.586
Mm-hmm.
Of course you do.

40:29.971 --> 40:33.522
Boys like you,
you deserve better.

40:33.522 --> 40:36.018
The best.

40:36.018 --> 40:38.323
You're special.

40:40.242 --> 40:43.123
And that's why I trust you.

40:44.658 --> 40:47.730
What do you say we
take a little spin?

40:48.114 --> 40:49.890
Yeah, man.

40:53.651 --> 40:57.171
The night's still young.
Let's do something!

40:57.554 --> 40:59.603
Yeah.

41:13.139 --> 41:15.059
Yeah?

41:15.059 --> 41:18.355
Mr. Harris? There's a car
waiting for you downstairs, sir.

42:29.908 --> 42:33.460
Excuse me.
Are you a friend?

42:38.901 --> 42:42.740
Sir? Sir?

42:50.372 --> 42:52.772
Lionel?

42:52.772 --> 42:55.173
- Lionel!
- Stay away!

42:55.173 --> 42:58.532
- Stay away from my son!
You hear me? - Mrs. Stevens...

42:58.532 --> 43:01.412
- You're evil, just like all the rest.
- I just want to talk to him.

43:01.412 --> 43:04.292
Get away! He doesn't need
friends like you!

43:09.013 --> 43:11.029
Lionel!

43:21.941 --> 43:23.476
This is him?
Carl Fraser?

43:23.861 --> 43:26.293
- I could be wrong.
- Let's hope not.

43:26.773 --> 43:29.332
He's been all over.
Brazil, Cuba, Mexico, Miami.

43:29.332 --> 43:33.940
We almost got him once,
smuggling into L.A. from Colombia.

43:33.940 --> 43:36.246
Eight months surveillance,

43:36.629 --> 43:40.469
40 D.E.A. videos,
tapes, everything.

43:40.469 --> 43:42.389
He didn't show.
He was tipped off.

43:42.772 --> 43:45.877
Turned out he bought
two of our guys.

43:45.877 --> 43:50.197
They disappeared and turned up six weeks later
in Mexico, their bodies dumped in a field.

43:50.197 --> 43:52.566
One shot to the head,
five to the body, just like them.

43:52.566 --> 43:55.733
I see.
You knew about this?

43:55.733 --> 43:58.085
It was the kids
that gave him away.

43:58.517 --> 44:00.438
He always recruits
kids of that age.

44:00.438 --> 44:03.541
Virgin hit men. No records.
Clean, enthusiastic.

44:03.925 --> 44:07.766
Makes them feel like they're a part of
something. Treats them like family.

44:08.149 --> 44:11.606
These kids killed Roy England,
Curtis Payne and Frank Pierce?

44:11.606 --> 44:13.590
I think so.

44:13.590 --> 44:15.510
Well, he shouldn't be
that difficult to find.

44:15.510 --> 44:17.813
Not if he's shipping
stuff in on this scale.

44:17.813 --> 44:19.734
You should familiarize
yourself with that.

44:19.734 --> 44:22.678
Familiarize myself? I should have known
about this from the very beginning.

44:22.678 --> 44:26.518
Come on, Edward! We couldn't say anything
until we were absolutely certain.

44:26.902 --> 44:30.550
We? A week ago I had 100 men
on this case; now I've got 98.

44:30.550 --> 44:32.470
It's a bit late to start
getting familiar.

44:32.470 --> 44:36.181
I'm not undermining your position, Edward,
but John needs more time.

44:36.567 --> 44:40.021
He knows Fraser.
That's why he's here.

44:40.021 --> 44:42.390
I thought he was here
as an advisor.

44:42.390 --> 44:47.542
He is. And I feel confident we shall be
seeing results, sooner rather than later.

44:58.135 --> 45:00.423
All right, all right!

45:01.653 --> 45:05.093
A bloody speech,
for what it's worth.

45:05.093 --> 45:09.078
Well, I'd like to thank
you all for coming.

45:10.262 --> 45:13.255
It means a lot to Katie and me.

45:13.719 --> 45:17.174
I'd, uh, I'd like to
thank my son for...

45:17.174 --> 45:20.263
for the most bloody awful speech
I've heard in my life.

45:20.742 --> 45:22.663
- Don't forget to thank them
for the cards! - What?

45:22.663 --> 45:24.583
- The cards. - Oh, okay.
- Hey, Dermott!

45:25.046 --> 45:26.614
- She's bossing you around
already! - Oh, no!

45:26.614 --> 45:28.822
- We've only been married two hours.
- Listen to her, will you?

45:28.822 --> 45:33.047
Thank you for the cards. Thank you for
the presents. Yes, you know, but I...

45:33.047 --> 45:36.022
No, thank you again,
thank you again. I'm...

45:36.407 --> 45:39.479
I suppose it's, uh,
it's times like this...

45:39.479 --> 45:41.239
when you realize who
your friends are, huh?

45:41.622 --> 45:45.558
Well, we'll, uh, we'll miss you all
when we get back to Dublin.

45:45.943 --> 45:48.775
And you better come and
visit us, you bastards!

45:48.775 --> 45:52.903
Come on now, raise 'em again,
and have one for yourselves!

45:52.903 --> 45:55.767
- We're only just beginning.
- Cheers.

45:56.151 --> 45:57.943
Cheers.

46:32.824 --> 46:34.968
- What are you doing here? - I thought
you might be able to help me.

46:34.968 --> 46:37.688
I did.
And I'm not proud of it.

46:37.688 --> 46:39.383
Sorry. I've got to get back
to my dad's wedding.

46:39.383 --> 46:42.296
Dwayne Henry and
Robert Dean are dead.

46:45.065 --> 46:49.400
Their bodies were found in a ditch out
in some field. They were both shot.

46:49.400 --> 46:51.832
You hear anything about it?

46:54.135 --> 46:55.673
No.

46:55.673 --> 46:58.361
What about Jack Doyle?

46:58.361 --> 47:00.280
What about him?

47:00.665 --> 47:02.200
You tell me.

47:02.584 --> 47:04.504
What is all of this to you, eh?

47:04.504 --> 47:07.575
- That's my business.
- Yeah?

47:07.960 --> 47:10.647
Well, this is my business.
this is where I live.

47:10.647 --> 47:14.921
These are all people I know.
leave me alone.

47:15.320 --> 47:17.576
Your people keep dying, Chris.

47:22.905 --> 47:27.944
Come all you maidens

47:27.944 --> 47:31.704
young and fair

47:31.704 --> 47:34.104
do you mind?
You'll have to excuse me.

47:34.104 --> 47:37.465
All you that are young?

47:37.944 --> 47:41.576
And in your prime?

47:44.937 --> 47:49.256
Always beware oh,
just a minute.

47:49.256 --> 47:52.136
Hello, Chris.
Been a good day, has it?

47:52.136 --> 47:55.993
- Yeah. - Good, good, good.
Who's this, you lucky boy?

47:56.376 --> 47:59.576
Rachael Stevens,
Jack Doyle.

47:59.576 --> 48:02.648
Pleased to meet you.
We all thought he was queer.

48:02.648 --> 48:05.112
Listen, you need anything,
anything at all, you come and see me.

48:05.112 --> 48:07.864
All right.
You're lovely.

48:07.864 --> 48:09.561
What was all that about?

48:09.976 --> 48:11.722
Nothin'.

48:15.098 --> 48:18.968
As time are you gonna dance
with me then?

48:18.968 --> 48:21.656
Brings all things
I can't dance.

48:21.656 --> 48:24.617
# To my mind #
- You have to.

48:27.016 --> 48:31.322
# Time with all its flavors

48:31.705 --> 48:34.425
# Along with all

48:34.425 --> 48:37.786
# Its joys # - Look who's come
to join us. - Hello, son.

48:37.786 --> 48:41.626
# Time brings all things #

48:41.626 --> 48:45.945
# To my mind # - You didn't tell
me they were going to Dublin.

48:45.945 --> 48:48.825
I don't know a thing
about you, do I?

48:49.306 --> 48:51.417
What do you want to know?

48:52.377 --> 48:54.777
What happened to
your real mother?

48:54.777 --> 48:57.657
- She's around somewhere.
- Mm-hmm.

48:59.097 --> 49:01.977
She got sick of him
being away all the time.

49:02.457 --> 49:05.817
He was either being banged up in
prison or kicked out of pubs.

49:08.697 --> 49:13.225
One day she gave me the family allowance book,
told a neighbor to keep an eye on me and left.

49:13.705 --> 49:15.625
- Mm-hmm.
- I was 12.

49:15.625 --> 49:17.546
I'm sorry.

49:17.546 --> 49:20.426
Oh, you!

49:20.426 --> 49:24.026
It's all right.
It was a long time ago.

49:24.026 --> 49:28.106
You get on with your life,
mind your own business.

49:30.266 --> 49:34.106
If you get happy along the way,
then you're lucky.

49:55.226 --> 49:59.626
I got a hold of a car for you.
It's there if you want it.

50:02.987 --> 50:07.658
I've been trying to get this guy to say
more than two words to me all afternoon.

50:07.658 --> 50:10.060
Want a drink?

50:10.060 --> 50:11.962
No, thanks.

50:12.347 --> 50:14.779
- Oh, come on, have a drink.
- I'll have a coke.

50:19.147 --> 50:21.068
Two cokes.

50:23.947 --> 50:26.172
Put a double vodka
in one of them.

50:27.322 --> 50:30.138
I looked at the report.

50:30.138 --> 50:32.826
It doesn't say how long
you've been after him.

50:32.826 --> 50:35.067
I mean, you, personally.

50:36.507 --> 50:40.346
I put him away once
a while back.

50:42.044 --> 50:44.507
I mean, that's what I'm
supposed to do, isn't it?

50:44.507 --> 50:48.267
What's the difference how long?
That's what we do.

50:48.666 --> 50:50.923
We chase bad guys.

50:50.923 --> 50:53.787
And he's a fucking bad guy.

50:56.155 --> 50:58.843
How old are you?

50:58.843 --> 51:01.916
- Why?
- Go on.

51:01.916 --> 51:04.139
- How old are you?
- Thirty-one.

51:04.139 --> 51:08.219
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

51:08.219 --> 51:11.387
How'd you get here?

51:11.387 --> 51:16.107
I served in the army for eight years, and I met
Donnelly when I was working with intelligence.

51:16.107 --> 51:19.355
He got you in the police force?

51:19.355 --> 51:22.379
Not every policeman has to
walk the beat, Mr. Harris.

51:22.859 --> 51:25.980
Sure.

51:25.980 --> 51:29.547
Sure, you can be ambitious.

51:32.459 --> 51:34.860
Scotland Yard, Sherlock.

51:41.580 --> 51:45.420
# From the port of old tralee
to the Dublin City bar

51:45.420 --> 51:49.260
# From the Cork and
Kerry Mountains to the sea

51:49.260 --> 51:52.620
# With a porter in my hand
I be singing with the band

51:52.620 --> 51:56.444
# And I'll drink
'til the party's over #

51:58.668 --> 52:02.989
Oh, lads, ah,
no bloody respect, eh?

52:02.989 --> 52:05.948
In our day there was dignity,
but not anymore.

52:05.948 --> 52:10.780
Now it's all drugs.
Crack? What is that?

52:10.780 --> 52:13.181
- It sounds like a bloody firework.
- Same effect, so I hear.

52:13.181 --> 52:17.981
The outsiders, Sid.
Bloody foreigners, Americans!

52:17.981 --> 52:21.820
It's like the bloody war again.
They're all over the place!

52:21.820 --> 52:24.700
You know, there's kids
younger than my son.

52:25.180 --> 52:28.669
They're hanging on to this yank
like he's some fucking pop star.

52:29.053 --> 52:31.389
What's that, Dermott?

52:31.773 --> 52:35.500
The yank. Oh, he's some
friend of Jack's.

52:35.500 --> 52:37.421
Something to do with the club.
I don't know.

52:37.901 --> 52:42.525
But I tell you what, if I caught
him using my boy, I'd kill him!

52:42.909 --> 52:47.133
We don't need them anymore. We've done
all right without them in the past.

52:47.133 --> 52:50.461
Let them keep their crack. Kick their
fucking asses back where they came from!

52:50.461 --> 52:52.733
- Who are you talking about,
Dermott? - Hey!

52:53.149 --> 52:55.549
How're you hanging, paddy?
Ain't you fallen over yet?

52:56.029 --> 52:58.429
- He's all right. - Listen, don't
neglect your missus tonight.

52:58.429 --> 53:01.869
- I said, he's all right.
- Yeah? And who the fuck asked you?

53:01.869 --> 53:06.589
Oh, hey, listen!
Hey, we're old friends.

53:06.589 --> 53:08.781
Since before you were born.

53:08.781 --> 53:12.637
There were none of your flash
motorcars and discos then!

53:12.637 --> 53:15.630
We did it the hard way.
Hard time!

53:15.630 --> 53:18.462
A stint in the
fucking army, eh, Sid?

53:18.462 --> 53:21.342
We was just talking, Jack.
Just talking.

53:26.910 --> 53:30.141
Ah, he's just tired.
He's a good guy. He's all right.

54:41.182 --> 54:44.062
What am I doing here?

54:44.062 --> 54:47.519
Do you want to go?

54:54.047 --> 54:55.999
Are you gonna let me
get to know you?

54:59.839 --> 55:01.759
Yeah, please.

55:53.760 --> 55:58.015
- Are you shaking?
- Yeah. It's cold.

56:09.184 --> 56:11.104
I feel stupid.

56:14.944 --> 56:18.016
I think I'm falling for you,
Christian O'Neill.

57:14.353 --> 57:17.713
- How long have you been here?
- About an hour, sir.

57:25.281 --> 57:28.705
The coroner reckoned he'd had a
lot to drink. Could have fallen in.

57:28.705 --> 57:32.065
- You've informed his wife?
- She's under sedation.

57:32.065 --> 57:33.985
Woke up this morning,
and he was missing.

57:34.465 --> 57:35.906
Open it up.

57:38.753 --> 57:39.969
Christ.

57:42.784 --> 57:44.608
Okay, then.

58:16.992 --> 58:20.354
- Morning.
- Morning.

58:25.059 --> 58:27.074
Don't get used to this.

58:34.529 --> 58:36.834
Rachael, would you stay
for a while?

58:43.362 --> 58:45.666
Let me show you something.

58:50.562 --> 58:53.442
- Here we are.
- Um, this is great.

58:58.722 --> 59:00.834
Do you come up here a lot?

59:26.722 --> 59:28.611
Yes.

59:30.947 --> 59:32.867
Thanks.

59:54.211 --> 59:56.947
Chris, what is it?
Chris.

01:00:02.276 --> 01:00:04.531
Chris, what is it?
Chris!

01:00:30.564 --> 01:00:32.867
No!

01:00:33.252 --> 01:00:34.948
No!

01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:40.228
Oh, no!

01:01:14.485 --> 01:01:18.613
Let us take leave
of our brother.

01:01:35.285 --> 01:01:37.684
Trusting in God...

01:03:55.927 --> 01:03:57.654
Chris.

01:03:57.654 --> 01:04:01.495
Ice. Now. Go.

01:05:47.881 --> 01:05:50.569
You were gonna kill me, were ya?

01:05:53.256 --> 01:05:56.712
If I see you again, I'll kill ya!

01:05:58.249 --> 01:06:02.089
Both of ya!
You understand?

01:06:03.624 --> 01:06:05.929
Now get out of here.

01:06:05.929 --> 01:06:07.897
Get out!

01:06:42.441 --> 01:06:44.521
Bastards!

01:06:54.890 --> 01:06:57.289
That-a-way!

01:06:58.730 --> 01:07:00.650
Sorry I'm late.

01:07:02.570 --> 01:07:04.969
I hate watching united.

01:07:04.969 --> 01:07:08.330
- No good, huh? - Too good.
Too fucking good, mate.

01:07:18.697 --> 01:07:20.618
Keep this for yourself.

01:07:20.618 --> 01:07:24.937
I been coming here
for fifty years.

01:07:24.937 --> 01:07:27.337
Have you got a team,
Mr. Harris?

01:07:27.337 --> 01:07:30.217
The Giants.
The New York Giants.

01:07:30.217 --> 01:07:32.137
My dad was nuts about them.

01:07:32.617 --> 01:07:36.938
- Took me to my first game when
I was four. - What's he do, your father?

01:07:36.938 --> 01:07:39.818
- He was a cop.
- I thought so.

01:07:39.818 --> 01:07:41.738
Following in his footsteps, eh?

01:07:41.738 --> 01:07:44.138
No, no, no.

01:07:44.138 --> 01:07:46.538
He got shot in the
back on the job.

01:07:46.538 --> 01:07:48.938
Killed by some 14-year-old punk.

01:07:49.418 --> 01:07:53.738
- I heard that kind of thing doesn't
happen over here. - Things change.

01:07:54.218 --> 01:07:56.618
We always catch up with
you yanks eventually.

01:07:56.618 --> 01:07:58.538
Skyscrapers, hot dogs,

01:07:58.538 --> 01:08:00.938
dishwashers,
remote controls.

01:08:00.938 --> 01:08:03.818
Now this.

01:08:03.818 --> 01:08:06.698
What did you want to tell me?

01:08:08.618 --> 01:08:10.442
I'm next, Mr. Harris.

01:08:10.826 --> 01:08:12.395
Why?

01:08:12.779 --> 01:08:16.457
My living's become
my undoing.

01:08:16.457 --> 01:08:18.379
I'm being hunted...

01:08:18.379 --> 01:08:20.298
by the sons of younger men,

01:08:20.298 --> 01:08:23.755
kids fighting somebody
else's war...

01:08:23.755 --> 01:08:26.059
because they don't know
any better.

01:08:28.363 --> 01:08:31.435
I'm a grandfather.

01:08:31.435 --> 01:08:34.124
Six-month-old baby boy.
I'm...

01:08:34.124 --> 01:08:36.426
Scared for him.

01:08:36.426 --> 01:08:38.345
Sounds funny, doesn't it?

01:08:38.345 --> 01:08:40.649
Someone like me.
But...

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:42.987
What can I do, eh?

01:08:42.987 --> 01:08:46.474
It's not my town any more.
I don't recognize it.

01:08:47.627 --> 01:08:51.466
I want to help you
to get this scum.

01:08:56.874 --> 01:09:00.683
- Is Jack around?
- Upstairs.

01:09:06.538 --> 01:09:10.763
- Who are you?
- Chris. I work here.

01:09:10.763 --> 01:09:12.683
Hmm.

01:09:14.987 --> 01:09:18.060
Well, would you do me
a favor, Chris?

01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:19.979
Tell Jack Mr. Fraser
has arrived.

01:09:20.363 --> 01:09:23.082
Yeah. Sure.

01:09:25.002 --> 01:09:26.573
- I'll take you up.
- Thank you.

01:09:30.890 --> 01:09:33.658
Mr. Doyle.

01:09:33.658 --> 01:09:35.883
- Excuse the Fr...
- Evenin', Mr. Doyle.

01:09:38.139 --> 01:09:41.580
Carl. I wasn't expectin'
you to drop by.

01:09:41.964 --> 01:09:44.011
What's the matter,
you don't like surprises?

01:09:44.011 --> 01:09:46.443
- I got you a present
and everything. - Great.

01:09:46.443 --> 01:09:48.747
- Shall we go upstairs? Chris, get some
drinks. You want a beer, Carl?

01:09:48.747 --> 01:09:51.930
- Yeah. Make sure it's cold, Chris.
- Mm-hmm.

01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:01.020
- Chris. You heard him.
- Yeah.

01:10:08.461 --> 01:10:12.172
Jesus Christ.
That is beautiful. Thanks.

01:10:12.172 --> 01:10:16.396
I know how hard it is to get hold
of these things over here, so...

01:10:16.396 --> 01:10:18.317
It's a good gun.

01:10:18.317 --> 01:10:20.236
- Listen, I should be buying
you something. - Aren't you?

01:10:20.236 --> 01:10:24.844
- It's going fine. Don't worry. - I never
worry, Jack. It makes me look ugly.

01:10:24.844 --> 01:10:29.485
Like, you know, I don't wanna
sit on this shit for too long.

01:10:29.485 --> 01:10:32.173
It's... it's here?

01:10:32.173 --> 01:10:35.293
Come on, Jack.
You know I don't talk...

01:10:35.293 --> 01:10:37.821
about stuff I ain't got.
Yeah, it's here.

01:10:37.821 --> 01:10:40.141
40 K's.

01:10:40.141 --> 01:10:43.213
That'll keep London talking
shit for a long time.

01:10:43.213 --> 01:10:47.052
- What, you bring it here?
- Yeah. It's up to you, Jack.

01:10:47.437 --> 01:10:49.740
I just wanna see it move.

01:11:03.469 --> 01:11:05.645
- What are you doing tonight?
- We're closed.

01:11:05.645 --> 01:11:08.653
You're closed? Good.
Come over to my place.

01:11:08.653 --> 01:11:14.093
We're gonna have a thing for some
investors. We'll work it out there, okay?

01:11:14.093 --> 01:11:16.845
How about you, Chris?
You about finished here?

01:11:16.845 --> 01:11:18.814
Is he almost...
could you let him off early?

01:11:19.197 --> 01:11:22.061
I wanted to take a ride around town.
He could show me stuff.

01:11:22.477 --> 01:11:26.830
Huh? Then we'll go over to my place,
we'll party a little.

01:11:26.830 --> 01:11:29.678
Have a nice little steak, huh?

01:11:29.678 --> 01:11:32.366
Fine. Yeah. Great.

01:11:34.285 --> 01:11:36.205
Like my car?

01:11:36.205 --> 01:11:40.046
Yeah.
What's not to like?

01:11:40.046 --> 01:11:42.493
You wanna drive?

01:11:42.493 --> 01:11:45.998
- I haven't got a license.
- So, don't hit anything.

01:11:46.382 --> 01:11:49.453
# Go, go #

01:11:52.814 --> 01:11:56.174
These guys
are so funny, man.

01:11:56.174 --> 01:11:58.862
Oh, man.

01:11:58.862 --> 01:12:02.414
I love this fuckin' town.

01:12:02.414 --> 01:12:04.398
You know?
I love this country.

01:12:04.398 --> 01:12:06.734
It's so, uh...
it's so...

01:12:06.734 --> 01:12:09.134
you know, so old.
You know.

01:12:09.134 --> 01:12:12.110
People got no ambition, though.

01:12:12.494 --> 01:12:15.741
I mean, it's a shame.
It's really fuckin' depressing.

01:12:19.710 --> 01:12:23.854
What about you, Chris? You gonna spend
the rest of your life behind a bar?

01:12:26.895 --> 01:12:29.230
Guy like you, you could have
anything you want.

01:12:29.230 --> 01:12:31.614
Any fuckin' thing you want.

01:12:31.614 --> 01:12:36.334
You know that?
It's up to you.

01:12:36.334 --> 01:12:38.734
# Hypocrisy is the
greatest luxury

01:12:39.214 --> 01:12:41.134
# Raise the double standard
hypocrisy

01:12:41.134 --> 01:12:43.055
# Is the greatest luxury

01:12:43.055 --> 01:12:45.455
# Raise the double standard
hypocrisy

01:12:45.455 --> 01:12:48.335
# Is the greatest luxury

01:12:48.783 --> 01:12:51.743
# Go, go, go, go
go, go, go, go

01:12:52.174 --> 01:12:56.015
# Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go

01:12:56.015 --> 01:12:57.934
# The race, the trouble
don't make a rebel

01:12:57.934 --> 01:13:00.334
# Havin' a life together does?

01:13:00.334 --> 01:13:02.223
# America has an image
of a young boy

01:13:02.223 --> 01:13:04.623
# Backstabbin' not
giving an expletive

01:13:04.623 --> 01:13:07.503
# No respect for his or the lives
of those around him

01:13:07.983 --> 01:13:09.423
# Well, suicidal, homicidal

01:13:09.423 --> 01:13:11.342
# Or at very least
extremely unbridled

01:13:11.342 --> 01:13:15.663
# How convenient for those who
would like to destroy him

01:13:15.663 --> 01:13:18.543
# The problem has never been
our political logic

01:13:18.543 --> 01:13:19.983
# But the way we enact it

01:13:19.983 --> 01:13:21.583
# We can imagine
a perfect society

01:13:21.583 --> 01:13:24.559
# But can't maintain
a decent relationship

01:13:24.559 --> 01:13:26.782
# The failure finding
the luxuries # - What's up?

01:13:26.782 --> 01:13:29.103
You still worried about
what happened?

01:13:29.103 --> 01:13:32.543
- Yeah. - Well, I'm upset too,
you know.

01:13:32.543 --> 01:13:35.375
- We're hearin' one thing from you and
one thing... - You're hearin', I'm hearin'.

01:13:35.375 --> 01:13:39.566
I'm hearin' all day about it.
I told you what happened.

01:13:39.566 --> 01:13:42.303
All right? There's no
secrets here. You know?

01:13:42.783 --> 01:13:45.664
Cops, I told you,
they kept him up all night.

01:13:45.664 --> 01:13:48.528
My boys didn't say nothin'.
Next morning, bullet to the head.

01:13:48.528 --> 01:13:51.456
- But they can't do that. - Yeah,
well, they did do it, all right?

01:13:51.456 --> 01:13:55.375
Why don't you fuckin' drop it? That's
what they got planned for people like us.

01:13:55.375 --> 01:13:59.104
Just watch your back,
keep your fuckin' mouth shut.

01:13:59.584 --> 01:14:01.840
- All right?
# Hypocrisy is the greatest luxury #

01:14:02.224 --> 01:14:04.336
Come on, loosen up.
You're makin' me look bad.

01:14:04.816 --> 01:14:08.176
It's a party. You want somethin',
take it. It's free.

01:14:09.616 --> 01:14:11.056
- Jesus.
# Raise the double standard

01:14:11.535 --> 01:14:13.456
# Hypocrisy is the
greatest luxury #

01:14:14.896 --> 01:14:17.776
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

01:14:20.416 --> 01:14:24.256
I didn't bring you here to suck
that shit up your nose all night.

01:14:27.425 --> 01:14:30.337
Ohh.

01:14:30.337 --> 01:14:32.256
Don't, please.

01:14:34.416 --> 01:14:37.471
Shut up! Do me a favor.
Do me a favor.

01:14:37.905 --> 01:14:40.704
Mingle. Mingle.

01:14:51.665 --> 01:14:54.977
Come on, fuck somethin'. What
do you think they're here for?

01:14:55.455 --> 01:14:57.856
Jesus Christ.

01:14:57.856 --> 01:15:01.937
- Fraser. Them lads I was
telling you about. - Yeah.

01:15:01.937 --> 01:15:03.664
They're over there.

01:15:05.056 --> 01:15:06.976
- They good boys?
- Yeah.

01:15:06.976 --> 01:15:08.689
Call me.

01:15:08.689 --> 01:15:11.457
Come forward, lads.

01:15:11.935 --> 01:15:15.776
This is Fraser. Fraser,
this is quick, and that's James.

01:15:15.776 --> 01:15:18.465
Pleased to meet you,
gentlemen.

01:15:20.865 --> 01:15:23.345
- So, you got everything you
need here? - Yeah, man.

01:15:23.345 --> 01:15:25.265
- Good to see you.
- Nice party.

01:15:25.265 --> 01:15:28.945
- How'd you like to make some quick money?
- I love to make money.

01:15:30.145 --> 01:15:32.065
Hey. Where you goin'?

01:15:32.065 --> 01:15:33.985
I've got to go.
Got somewhere else to be.

01:15:33.985 --> 01:15:35.906
Oh. Well, you be good,
All right?

01:15:35.906 --> 01:15:38.305
Hey, wait!

01:15:39.537 --> 01:15:42.608
- Got a cigarette?
- Yeah.

01:15:43.056 --> 01:15:44.785
Good.

01:15:47.185 --> 01:15:49.586
- So, uh, you're leaving?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:15:50.065 --> 01:15:53.425
- What's the matter, aren't you having fun?
- No, it's great. I'm tired.

01:15:53.425 --> 01:15:55.345
Oh, you're tired.

01:15:55.825 --> 01:15:57.746
- Okay, go. Go.
- Yeah.

01:15:57.746 --> 01:16:00.626
- Hey, you want a ride? I'll give
you a ride. - No. No, thanks.

01:16:00.626 --> 01:16:02.546
# Seriously it can't
be like that

01:16:02.546 --> 01:16:05.185
# But before I put my foot
in my mouth #

01:16:05.185 --> 01:16:09.024
- He's okay. - Yeah, he's
one of the family.

01:17:13.267 --> 01:17:16.147
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:17:16.147 --> 01:17:19.507
I-I was just puttin' me walkman
away. It's knackered.

01:17:19.507 --> 01:17:21.907
- Where you headed?
- Bethnal Green.

01:17:21.907 --> 01:17:24.787
- I'll come with ya.
- Yeah. Sure.

01:17:47.410 --> 01:17:50.898
- This has to stop. - You know who it is.
Just arrest him.

01:17:50.898 --> 01:17:54.034
- You've met him?
- Yes, I've met him.

01:17:54.034 --> 01:17:55.779
What's wrong, Chris?

01:17:55.779 --> 01:17:59.634
One of the guys at the club... Mark Byrne...
I think he suspects something.

01:17:59.634 --> 01:18:01.554
Who's he?

01:18:01.939 --> 01:18:04.242
Jack's hardly ever there.

01:18:04.242 --> 01:18:07.058
Mark kinda runs things.

01:18:07.058 --> 01:18:10.131
He knows everything.
He watches me.

01:18:10.131 --> 01:18:13.204
- I can feel him watching me.
- Something's going to happen soon? Where?

01:18:13.587 --> 01:18:17.427
You don't care, do you?

01:18:25.268 --> 01:18:27.635
At the club, probably.

01:18:27.635 --> 01:18:29.555
It's all on the tape.

01:18:32.244 --> 01:18:34.932
Tell me about Mark Byrne.

01:18:55.380 --> 01:18:59.219
What are you doing?

01:18:59.219 --> 01:19:02.676
- I'm just trying to find out
something about you. - Did you?

01:19:06.132 --> 01:19:08.052
What do you expect me to do?

01:19:09.588 --> 01:19:11.892
Look,

01:19:11.892 --> 01:19:14.197
you've been spending a lot
of time here recently.

01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:17.636
I-I don't think it's,
it's fair on, on you. I can't...

01:19:17.636 --> 01:19:20.036
You want me to leave?
Fine.

01:19:20.036 --> 01:19:21.956
- Get off me!
- Rachael. - Get off me!

01:19:21.956 --> 01:19:25.172
- Listen to me. - I'm trying, Chris,
but you don't say anything.

01:19:25.172 --> 01:19:26.996
- Wait.
- Don't touch me!

01:19:27.381 --> 01:19:29.717
You asked me to stay,
now you want me to go!

01:19:29.717 --> 01:19:32.085
- You don't understand!
- No, I don't understand!

01:19:32.468 --> 01:19:34.276
You disappear without a word,
you come back,

01:19:34.276 --> 01:19:36.196
You won't even tell me
where you've been!

01:19:36.196 --> 01:19:40.148
I mean, what am I supposed
to think, Chris?

01:19:40.148 --> 01:19:41.812
What are you so scared of?

01:19:44.117 --> 01:19:46.052
How can you stand
being so unhappy?

01:19:48.405 --> 01:19:50.070
How can I?

01:20:11.573 --> 01:20:13.524
Hello?

01:20:14.678 --> 01:20:17.046
- Hi.
- John?

01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:22.806
- How are you? - Christ, John, it's the
middle of the night. I'm exhausted.

01:20:26.645 --> 01:20:31.094
Marty's been whining all day.
He locked himself in his room.

01:20:31.094 --> 01:20:33.782
Is he okay?

01:20:33.782 --> 01:20:35.702
He lost a tooth.

01:20:35.702 --> 01:20:39.157
He's been crying all afternoon.

01:20:39.542 --> 01:20:42.805
Why'd he get so upset?

01:20:42.805 --> 01:20:47.189
Because the tooth fairy forgot to
leave something under his pillow.

01:20:47.574 --> 01:20:50.391
I was busy. I forgot.

01:20:50.391 --> 01:20:52.998
Oh.

01:20:52.998 --> 01:20:54.998
You all right?

01:20:55.381 --> 01:20:58.070
Fine.

01:20:58.454 --> 01:21:01.910
Okay, I gotta go.
The tooth fairy's beat.

01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:07.670
What's wrong?

01:21:10.741 --> 01:21:13.045
It'll be okay.

01:21:13.045 --> 01:21:15.733
Yeah, I know.

01:21:17.670 --> 01:21:21.541
John.

01:21:21.541 --> 01:21:23.846
What do you want, John?

01:21:29.719 --> 01:21:31.638
I, um...

01:21:35.094 --> 01:21:37.782
I, uh...

01:21:37.782 --> 01:21:39.702
Just wanted to talk.

01:21:44.311 --> 01:21:46.150
Oh, hi. How are ya?

01:21:46.150 --> 01:21:48.551
I'll get this and send
somebody to pay for it.

01:21:48.551 --> 01:21:52.391
Who came up with the idea of sticking
a slice of lime in a bottle of beer?

01:21:52.391 --> 01:21:54.311
Probably the geezer that first
tasted the contents. Fizzy piss.

01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:56.710
- Can I get you a girl, luv?
- Don't beg.

01:21:56.710 --> 01:21:59.111
Toss off.

01:21:59.111 --> 01:22:01.991
You all right?
Come on, spit it out.

01:22:03.912 --> 01:22:06.792
- I wanna ask you something.
- What?

01:22:08.230 --> 01:22:10.631
- You wanna score
something? - Yeah.

01:22:10.631 --> 01:22:13.030
- Something to liven
me up. - Yeah.

01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:16.391
- Let's go down there.
- Yeah, come on. No problem.

01:22:24.919 --> 01:22:28.472
Let's see what we got here
for you, then.

01:22:28.951 --> 01:22:32.791
Listen, Christian, take it easy
on this shit, all right?

01:22:32.791 --> 01:22:35.671
- Promise me?
- Of course. Cheers.

01:22:36.152 --> 01:22:38.072
- How much do I owe you?
- It's all done. - Take it.

01:22:38.551 --> 01:22:40.952
- It's all right. - Please.
- I don't want it. - Go on.

01:22:40.952 --> 01:22:43.992
- No. - Take it. 
- No! - Take it!

01:22:43.992 --> 01:22:46.872
- Fucking take it!
- Stop! Police!

01:22:46.872 --> 01:22:49.879
- Hands up! Stand still!
- Hands in the air!

01:22:52.632 --> 01:22:54.871
Cuff him!

01:22:58.488 --> 01:23:01.832
Grass. Grass. Grass!

01:23:01.832 --> 01:23:06.632
- Fucking grasses! Fucking grasses!
- Hold him! Stop it!

01:23:06.632 --> 01:23:09.512
Shut your mouth!

01:23:12.392 --> 01:23:14.311
Grass!

01:23:15.751 --> 01:23:19.319
- All right!
- Cuff him!

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:21.239
Grass!

01:23:27.479 --> 01:23:29.687
- Get off. Don't touch me.
- It's okay, Chris.

01:23:29.687 --> 01:23:31.880
Bullshit, it's okay!

01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:34.232
I can't do it.
Not like that.

01:23:34.232 --> 01:23:38.071
Yes, you can. Yes, you can.
You can. You can do it.

01:23:38.071 --> 01:23:39.992
I'll see you!

01:23:39.992 --> 01:23:42.760
Grass!

01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:47.176
Calm down. Everything's
gonna be all right.

01:23:48.952 --> 01:23:51.608
It's almost over.
You can trust me.

01:24:02.424 --> 01:24:04.761
- You seen Mark?
- No.

01:24:04.761 --> 01:24:08.600
- The last time I saw him he was in
the market. - Where the fuck is he?

01:24:11.288 --> 01:24:13.321
I'm sorry, Jack.
I can't find him anywhere.

01:24:13.704 --> 01:24:15.242
- Where the fuck's he disappeared to?
- Fucking nowhere!

01:24:15.642 --> 01:24:18.840
Did you ask Chris?
Does he know where he is?

01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:23.609
Chris? Now listen, tonight you're
gonna have your hands full.

01:24:23.609 --> 01:24:26.680
I'm gonna be busy with Mr. Fraser.
Any problems at all,

01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:30.136
you're gonna have to
sort it out yourself.

01:24:30.136 --> 01:24:33.593
- I do not want to be disturbed when
I'm with him, understand? - Okay.

01:24:33.977 --> 01:24:36.666
Billy? Right.
Listen, find him,

01:24:36.666 --> 01:24:40.888
And when you do, get him here
or I'll chop his fucking dick off!

01:24:45.497 --> 01:24:47.801
Mr. Harris, it's for you.
Christian O'Neill.

01:24:51.161 --> 01:24:54.040
Chris?

01:25:19.961 --> 01:25:21.497
Hey, how you doin'?

01:25:24.185 --> 01:25:26.873
- So, what do we do?
- Wait.

01:25:26.873 --> 01:25:29.561
- Gum?
- No.

01:25:52.074 --> 01:25:54.474
Don't say it. It's Mark Byrne.
He's been released.

01:25:54.954 --> 01:25:56.730
- How? - Jesus Christ!
- A technicality.

01:25:56.730 --> 01:25:59.290
The O'Neill boy didn't take the drugs.
They didn't do the deal.

01:25:59.673 --> 01:26:01.690
We can only charge him
with possession.

01:26:02.074 --> 01:26:03.898
This changes nothing.
We're ready to move.

01:26:03.898 --> 01:26:05.610
Byrne would have gone
straight to the club.

01:26:05.610 --> 01:26:08.858
- We gotta get Chris out. - If we pull the kid out,
we could lose the whole thing.

01:26:09.242 --> 01:26:11.930
- Byrne could've phoned anyway. - To tell them
he fucked up? He'll deal with it himself.

01:26:11.930 --> 01:26:14.442
You're guessing, Harris.
I'm sorry for the kid,

01:26:14.442 --> 01:26:16.346
-but we do it as planned.
- I agree.

01:26:16.346 --> 01:26:19.962
This operation is far too important
to jeopardize now, for any reason.

01:26:24.155 --> 01:26:25.963
Tell me exactly what happened.

01:26:25.963 --> 01:26:28.362
O'Neill dropped the drugs
as he gave him the money.

01:26:28.362 --> 01:26:31.483
- Nothing we could hold
him with? - Harris!

01:26:35.163 --> 01:26:37.483
Who are you calling?
Christian?

01:26:37.483 --> 01:26:39.643
- I can't let you do that.
- I'm not calling him.

01:27:01.979 --> 01:27:04.764
- Where have you been?
- I need to speak to you, Mr. Doyle.

01:27:04.764 --> 01:27:06.684
In private.

01:27:06.684 --> 01:27:08.604
Excuse me. Upstairs.

01:27:08.604 --> 01:27:11.195
Where you goin'?

01:27:11.195 --> 01:27:13.116
I'll be back.

01:27:16.203 --> 01:27:19.067
- I gotta talk to you. now,
Rachael, please. - Not now.

01:27:19.451 --> 01:27:21.196
- No.
- You gotta get out.

01:27:21.196 --> 01:27:23.868
Rachael, get out!

01:27:55.035 --> 01:27:58.396
- Cut!
- Aaaah!

01:28:08.684 --> 01:28:12.252
Oh, for Christ's sake, Harris.

01:28:12.252 --> 01:28:14.316
What's he doing here?

01:28:21.405 --> 01:28:24.237
- One moving van on
its way. - Okay.

01:28:40.317 --> 01:28:43.005
A little late for a delivery.

01:29:11.645 --> 01:29:13.613
What you looking for,
Chris, a gun?

01:29:15.901 --> 01:29:18.445
What were you going to do,
kill me, man?

01:29:21.036 --> 01:29:25.005
What have you done, Chris?
Come on, what the fuck have you done?

01:29:25.484 --> 01:29:27.405
What were you going to
make it out of it?

01:29:27.405 --> 01:29:30.046
Tell me, what were you
going to gain?

01:29:33.949 --> 01:29:35.933
Stand by.

01:29:37.470 --> 01:29:40.126
Just fucking kill me, Jack.
You've destroyed everything else.

01:29:40.510 --> 01:29:42.460
I took you in!
I gave you everything!

01:29:42.846 --> 01:29:47.005
- You killed my dad! You fucking killed him!
- Your dad was a fucking drunk!

01:29:47.005 --> 01:29:50.606
He was a fool! He'd have ruined
everything I worked for!

01:29:50.606 --> 01:29:53.278
Ruined what? Another
fucking drug deal, eh?

01:29:53.278 --> 01:29:57.198
Come on, kill me! I don't care
anymore. Just fucking kill me!

01:29:57.198 --> 01:29:59.566
- Is that what you want?
- Yeah! - Really?

01:30:02.302 --> 01:30:06.302
- That's him.
- Go! Go!

01:30:11.405 --> 01:30:14.286
Move it!

01:30:40.607 --> 01:30:43.647
Police!

01:30:53.310 --> 01:30:56.382
Chris?

01:30:56.382 --> 01:30:59.071
Chris!
Chr... aah!

01:30:59.071 --> 01:31:02.494
Is that your boyfriend?

01:31:02.494 --> 01:31:04.687
- Let her go.
- John.

01:31:06.607 --> 01:31:09.599
Where's your gun?

01:31:11.998 --> 01:31:14.687
How do you like London?

01:31:14.687 --> 01:31:16.607
- Same shit, different town.
- Let her go.

01:31:16.607 --> 01:31:18.495
Fuck you!

01:31:24.928 --> 01:31:26.798
Aaah!

01:32:18.528 --> 01:32:20.688
You okay?
You okay?

01:32:27.087 --> 01:32:29.488
Satisfied?

01:32:29.488 --> 01:32:31.408
Put the gun down, Chris.

01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:38.496
- It was self-defense.
- All right.

01:32:38.496 --> 01:32:42.912
- It's over. Put it down.
- You arresting me?

01:32:42.912 --> 01:32:45.215
Put the gun down.

01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:12.577
Okay.

01:33:14.496 --> 01:33:16.033
We have to go.

01:34:21.410 --> 01:34:24.034
Hi, it's me.

01:34:24.034 --> 01:34:27.601
Hi. Where are you?

01:34:27.601 --> 01:34:31.394
London.
I'm at the airport.

01:34:31.394 --> 01:34:34.402
I'm going back
to Los Angeles.

01:34:34.402 --> 01:34:36.962
What, right now?

01:34:37.441 --> 01:34:41.170
I've got a connecting flight.
I'll be stopping in New York.

01:34:41.170 --> 01:34:44.754
- Yeah?
- I thought I'd...

01:34:44.754 --> 01:34:47.457
I thought I'd come by.

01:34:47.457 --> 01:34:50.945
Um, to see...
to see the kids.

01:34:50.945 --> 01:34:54.017
Yeah. Okay.
They'd like to see you.

01:34:56.370 --> 01:34:58.769
All right.

01:34:59.250 --> 01:35:01.649
- Good. See you.
- All right. Call me when you get in.

01:35:10.771 --> 01:35:15.249
Virgin Atlantic Airways
flight number V-S-0-0-1...

01:35:15.249 --> 01:35:19.090
departing for Newark
is now boarding at gate 12.

01:36:39.492 --> 01:36:42.372
# Darling

01:36:42.372 --> 01:36:46.212
# Stop confusing me

01:36:46.212 --> 01:36:51.972
# With your wishful thinking

01:36:51.972 --> 01:36:58.212
# Hopeful embraces

01:36:58.212 --> 01:37:03.972
# Don't you understand

01:37:03.972 --> 01:37:09.253
# I have to go through this

01:37:09.253 --> 01:37:13.092
# I belong to there
where no one cares

01:37:13.092 --> 01:37:15.491
# And no one loves

01:37:15.972 --> 01:37:21.251
# And I don't care
to live in

01:37:21.733 --> 01:37:24.613
# A place called hate

01:37:24.613 --> 01:37:28.453
# The city of hate

01:37:28.453 --> 01:37:31.333
# Aaaah

01:37:32.772 --> 01:37:35.652
# Aah-aah-aah-aah

01:37:36.133 --> 01:37:38.532
# Hate

01:37:51.493 --> 01:37:55.333
# I play dead

01:37:58.214 --> 01:38:02.532
# It starves the wanting in me

01:38:03.013 --> 01:38:08.292
# I play dead

01:38:10.212 --> 01:38:15.972
# And it hurts to start

01:38:15.972 --> 01:38:21.253
# It's sometimes
just like sleepin'

01:38:21.253 --> 01:38:24.133
# Curling up inside

01:38:24.613 --> 01:38:27.974
# Crying crying in torture

01:38:27.974 --> 01:38:33.253
# I must give in to pain

01:38:33.253 --> 01:38:36.614
# And suffering

01:38:36.614 --> 01:38:39.972
# Caress every name

01:38:39.972 --> 01:38:43.333
# Ohhhh

01:38:43.333 --> 01:38:46.213
# Yaah yah yah

01:38:46.693 --> 01:38:53.893
# Aaaaaaah #
