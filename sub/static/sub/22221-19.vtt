WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:03.117
Just keep going.

00:03.212 --> 00:04.713
Follow the Nexus Coordinates.

00:04.797 --> 00:07.254
Pilot:
But we've been following them
for three solar days.

00:07.341 --> 00:09.081
Just follow them, Pilot.

00:09.177 --> 00:11.293
Or do I have to take over
manual command?
-Zhaan, maybe...

00:11.387 --> 00:13.218
Go away, Crichton.

00:15.099 --> 00:18.591
All right, look, we've all been
talking. We think maybe we
should turn back.

00:19.187 --> 00:20.267
No.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.015
When Stark communicated
with me,

00:22.106 --> 00:26.019
he insisted that we follow
the Nexus Coordinates.

00:26.110 --> 00:28.146
If we do what he says,
he will be there.

00:28.237 --> 00:29.738
There's nothing
out there, okay?

00:29.822 --> 00:32.234
Aeryn has gone and done
the long range recon...

00:32.325 --> 00:34.111
We should return to the
slave auction immediately.

00:34.202 --> 00:36.067
And do what?

00:36.162 --> 00:39.370
We have no currency, D'Argo.
We cannot save your son.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.748
But we can save Stark.

00:44.295 --> 00:46.377
Zhaan, maybe, uh...

00:47.256 --> 00:49.087
What?

00:49.175 --> 00:50.506
Well, maybe I'm...

00:50.593 --> 00:54.802
I'm just saying maybe you
didn't communicate with Stark.

00:54.889 --> 01:00.225
You know, Zhaan, sometimes when
we want something really badly,

01:00.311 --> 01:02.302
we think things happen
when they don't.

01:02.396 --> 01:05.433
I do not need a lesson
from you, child.

01:05.524 --> 01:08.311
This mask talked to me.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.903
Unless you all think I'm
imagining it.

01:09.987 --> 01:12.148
I do.

01:12.240 --> 01:18.531
Stark is gone, but my son
is still alive.

01:18.621 --> 01:23.786
So I want you to turn
this ship around.

01:25.586 --> 01:31.297
Crichton, do you also believe I
am imagining my communication
with Stark?

01:33.678 --> 01:36.795
Bluey, since we've been together

01:36.889 --> 01:39.596
you've shown me some
pretty wacky things.

01:39.684 --> 01:43.222
But it's been three days,
and D'Argo's son...

01:43.312 --> 01:44.518
Stark:
Don't give up.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.391
Don't stop, Zhaan.

01:46.482 --> 01:48.063
Hurry.

01:48.150 --> 01:49.651
I'm dying.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.726
Pilot:
Moya's found something.

01:51.821 --> 01:54.107
There's a ship directly
in front of us.

01:54.198 --> 01:55.438
Stark!

01:55.533 --> 01:57.489
Moya's sensors are picking
up one being.

01:57.576 --> 01:59.362
Maneuver close and deploy
the docking web.

01:59.453 --> 02:03.196
The life is faint, Crichton.
We have to reach him quickly.

02:08.713 --> 02:09.919
He's barely breathing.

02:10.006 --> 02:12.042
This is impossible.
We saw him die.

02:12.133 --> 02:14.169
Well, let's get him to Zhaan
before he dies again.

02:14.260 --> 02:15.796
( hyperventilating )

02:15.886 --> 02:18.343
D'Argol D'Argo, I've done it.
I've found it.

02:18.431 --> 02:21.093
I know how to save your son.

02:28.190 --> 02:30.351
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

02:30.443 --> 02:33.856
A radiation wave hit and I got
shot through a wormhole.

02:33.946 --> 02:36.653
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship,

02:36.741 --> 02:40.325
a living ship, full of strange
alien life-forms.

02:40.411 --> 02:41.161
Help me.

02:41.245 --> 02:42.451
Listen, please.

02:42.538 --> 02:44.369
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

02:44.457 --> 02:48.746
I'm being hunted by an insane
military commander.

02:48.836 --> 02:51.202
I'm doing everything I can.

02:51.297 --> 02:54.130
I'm just looking for
a way home.

03:12.943 --> 03:14.319
It's all here, D'Argo.

03:14.403 --> 03:16.359
Everything, everything.
-Be calm, Stark. Be calm.

03:16.447 --> 03:18.813
What is this dren? How will it
help me save my son?

03:18.908 --> 03:20.318
I've got a plan, a plan to...

03:20.409 --> 03:23.196
Shh! Stark, your life signs
are still weak.

03:23.287 --> 03:24.367
Just let him talk.

03:24.455 --> 03:27.288
Crichton:
Hang on. Before we hear
about any plan,

03:27.375 --> 03:30.959
inquiring minds want to know
how the hell did you get here?

03:31.045 --> 03:32.410
I stole a ship.

03:32.505 --> 03:34.461
No, on the hubcap.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.925
You were executed.
You were dispersed.

03:37.009 --> 03:41.969
Crichton, this body is only
a... a molecular creation.

03:42.056 --> 03:44.263
Which enables me to live
in your realm.

03:44.350 --> 03:50.141
It's merely a... a vessel for
my true incorporeal self.

03:50.231 --> 03:52.847
You want to run that by
me one more time?

03:52.942 --> 03:57.686
When I dispersed, I instantly
traveled to locate these plans
and blueprints.

03:57.780 --> 04:03.946
And then I... l reconstituted
the shell of this body, and...

04:04.036 --> 04:08.200
and stole a ship to
come find you.

04:08.290 --> 04:10.622
Chiana:
I told you he was still alive.

04:10.709 --> 04:12.119
I don't believe it.

04:12.211 --> 04:14.122
Zhaan was telling the
truth, I...

04:15.339 --> 04:16.499
Go on, Stark.

04:16.590 --> 04:21.175
Ka D'Argo, your son is being
sold in a lot of 10,000 slaves.

04:21.262 --> 04:26.131
Now, this is a blueprint
for a depository.

04:26.225 --> 04:27.180
What, you mean like a bank?

04:27.268 --> 04:29.429
Yes.
-Are we gonna rob a bank?

04:29.520 --> 04:30.851
Yesl

04:30.938 --> 04:32.644
Steal other people's currency
to help ourselves?

04:32.731 --> 04:34.596
We can't do that, I can't.

04:34.692 --> 04:36.182
Well, sure you can.

04:36.277 --> 04:38.768
Stark:
Zhaan, it is not a
normal depository.

04:38.863 --> 04:41.070
It is one that services
only criminals

04:41.157 --> 04:44.194
who wish to hide what they
have stolen from others.

04:44.285 --> 04:47.743
Rygel:
Wait a microt. Are you talking
about a shadow depository?

04:47.830 --> 04:52.324
Yes, and it's within the range
of a Transport Pod from here.

04:52.418 --> 04:54.204
Hmm. So you are insane.

04:54.295 --> 05:00.165
Well, I saw a shadow depository
once that had more firepower
than a Gammak Base.

05:00.259 --> 05:05.299
Yes, but with these I can
control the internal depository
door motion detectors.

05:05.389 --> 05:06.674
And these...

05:06.765 --> 05:09.472
these are a complete set
of blueprints.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.801
Vault layout, everything.

05:11.896 --> 05:16.606
In one container is enough
wealth to buy the entire
shipment of slaves

05:16.692 --> 05:21.982
and still have enough left over
to make all of us filthy
rich forever.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.109
Where did you get these?

05:25.201 --> 05:28.318
I helped the deposit designer
cross over to death.

05:28.412 --> 05:30.653
His last thoughts led
me to these.

05:30.748 --> 05:32.955
They're genuine.

05:33.042 --> 05:35.328
Did you kill him?

05:35.419 --> 05:37.125
Not exactly.

05:37.213 --> 05:39.750
Aeryn:
Did the designer have enough
time to explain to you

05:39.840 --> 05:43.003
how much firepower is actually
inside this depository?

05:43.093 --> 05:44.128
Not...

05:44.220 --> 05:45.380
not precisely.

05:45.471 --> 05:46.961
Oh, that's comforting.

05:47.056 --> 05:48.842
We're going to have to go down
and have a look for ourselves.

05:48.933 --> 05:52.346
Aeryn:
Their arsenal would be massive.
This is suicide, D'Argo.

05:52.436 --> 05:55.303
Well, it's the only way we
can save my son. We must
consider it.

05:55.397 --> 05:57.228
D'Argo, wait. No, no, no.

05:57.316 --> 05:59.227
I know this is important.

05:59.318 --> 06:02.560
I know you want to do this
but it is not possible.

06:02.655 --> 06:04.270
You won't even consider this?

06:04.365 --> 06:05.901
ljust don't see how we...

06:05.991 --> 06:07.106
Well, fine!
We'll go without you.

06:07.201 --> 06:09.317
We'll go without all
four of you.

06:09.411 --> 06:11.197
Chiana, it's just you,
me and Stark.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.279
Well sure Bubba, but you
know, maybe...

06:13.374 --> 06:14.784
maybe we should just...
-What? You're against me, too?

06:14.875 --> 06:16.490
No, no, I'm with you. It's...

06:16.585 --> 06:21.204
When you ask me to do
something, did I ever question
if it was possible?

06:21.298 --> 06:24.790
D'Argo, I...
-No, I didn't.

06:25.511 --> 06:28.548
You cowards. All of you.

06:37.606 --> 06:39.187
Pilot:
He does not need my permission.

06:39.275 --> 06:40.481
Crichton:
Get him on the phone.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.524
He is not responding to
any of my signals.

06:42.611 --> 06:44.852
D'Argol
-How much of a head start
does he have?

06:44.947 --> 06:48.531
He cleared Moya not more
than 50 microts ago.

06:48.617 --> 06:51.950
Crichton:
D'Argo, pick up the damn phone.
I know you can hear me.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.575
D'Argo?!
-We're taking the Prowler.

07:06.719 --> 07:08.926
That's big.

07:09.013 --> 07:10.799
It's very big.

07:16.145 --> 07:22.232
Natira:
| suggest you take it, or
your business will be no longer appreciated.

07:22.318 --> 07:24.809
Threp:
Don't threaten me, Natira.
-Don't lose D'Argo.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.315
And don't forget who I am.

07:27.406 --> 07:29.067
I haven't.

07:29.158 --> 07:31.945
You're nobody here.

07:32.036 --> 07:36.154
But do as I say, and we'll let
the relationship unfold.

07:36.248 --> 07:38.113
Just, um...

07:38.417 --> 07:39.247
What?

07:39.335 --> 07:40.370
Scorpius.

07:40.461 --> 07:41.792
Where?

07:41.879 --> 07:45.417
Over there. Talking to that
weird, blue alien.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.709
That's not Scorpius.
You're having visions again.

07:50.638 --> 07:52.128
Have a look.

07:52.222 --> 07:54.429
Natira:
But that should be the least
of your worries.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.007
See?

07:57.102 --> 07:58.387
Sorry about that.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.102
And we're worried about D'Argo.

08:01.774 --> 08:03.514
(alarm blaring)

08:07.279 --> 08:09.190
Hand over your weapons...

08:09.281 --> 08:11.237
slowly.

08:11.325 --> 08:15.944
What is your business here,
Peacekeepers?

08:16.580 --> 08:18.116
Good.

08:18.207 --> 08:21.199
Very, very good.
-Clear, Akkor.

08:21.293 --> 08:22.533
You in charge here?

08:22.628 --> 08:24.994
What is your business?

08:25.089 --> 08:27.705
This is a depository, right?

08:27.800 --> 08:29.210
We have something to deposit.

08:29.301 --> 08:32.168
What makes you think
we'd be interested?

08:32.262 --> 08:34.389
You ever hear of KFC?

08:35.307 --> 08:36.683
KFC?

08:36.767 --> 08:39.474
It is, to my knowledge,
unique in the universe.

08:39.561 --> 08:43.304
And unique is always valuable.

08:43.399 --> 08:47.233
Now we have managed to procure
all 11 secret ingredients.

08:47.319 --> 08:51.608
What we need to do now is
discuss the terms of...
-Security breach, portal five!

08:51.699 --> 08:53.655
Guards! The Luxan!

08:54.326 --> 08:55.566
Seize him!

08:56.912 --> 08:58.368
( groans )

08:58.455 --> 09:00.946
Gan:
Get him on the ground.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.781
On the ground.
-On the ground.

09:04.628 --> 09:06.129
Hold him!

09:08.340 --> 09:10.046
Wait.

09:10.134 --> 09:11.544
D'Argo:
l was told the security
here was week. -What for?

09:11.635 --> 09:14.251
l was right. The security
here is frelled.

09:14.346 --> 09:15.426
SHence!

09:37.995 --> 09:40.327
As a race,

09:40.414 --> 09:43.872
Luxans can be inartful at love,

09:43.959 --> 09:47.201
inadequate at war

09:47.296 --> 09:49.628
and intrinsically inept.

09:51.508 --> 09:55.797
But this one, is intelligent.

09:55.888 --> 09:57.799
Shall I execute him?

09:57.890 --> 09:59.630
Natira:
No.

09:59.725 --> 10:02.933
He also expects to be
interrogated.

10:03.020 --> 10:04.851
Don't you...

10:05.773 --> 10:09.061
Ka D'Argo.

10:10.027 --> 10:11.642
See?

10:12.738 --> 10:15.571
It's a dance, gentlemen.

10:15.657 --> 10:17.784
Let's not disappoint him.

10:17.868 --> 10:19.153
(groaning)

10:19.244 --> 10:21.360
(laughing)

10:21.455 --> 10:26.324
You went to so much trouble to
open that door, Ka D'Argo...

10:27.252 --> 10:29.413
be my guest.

10:29.505 --> 10:31.791
(groaning and coughing)

10:31.882 --> 10:33.122
It's time to go.

10:36.094 --> 10:37.254
Aeryn.

10:44.895 --> 10:46.385
You! You set him up.

10:46.480 --> 10:49.438
D'Argo is down there
because of you!

10:49.525 --> 10:52.608
Look, you left him no choice!
He had to, had to.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.901
It's the only way to save
Jothee. It's the plan!

10:54.988 --> 10:57.104
What plan?! What are you
talking about?!

10:57.199 --> 11:01.818
The plan, the plan to get
D'Argo back and to rob
the depository.

11:01.912 --> 11:04.870
But you put the whole place
on security alert!

11:06.959 --> 11:10.122
It's his... it's all part of
the plan, you see?

11:10.212 --> 11:14.125
Because D'Argo's breached the
system, they'll scramble
their codes.

11:14.216 --> 11:16.798
And while they're resetting
their security codes,

11:16.885 --> 11:19.547
I can link in and they'll
never even know.

11:19.638 --> 11:23.176
But I have to work quickly.

11:23.267 --> 11:24.928
So you'll leave me alone!

11:25.018 --> 11:28.181
I've only got six arns before
they reset their codes.

11:28.272 --> 11:29.808
I'm going to reset his codes.

11:29.898 --> 11:32.640
How the hell are we supposed
to get D'Argo back?!

11:32.734 --> 11:34.349
Don't worry about a thing.

11:34.444 --> 11:36.275
I've got it all figured out.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.194
It's all part of the plan.

11:38.282 --> 11:41.024
You better have it all
figured out. D'Argo bet
his life on that.

11:41.118 --> 11:44.610
No, he bet his son's
life on that.

11:45.914 --> 11:48.155
You manipulated us.

11:50.627 --> 11:54.290
This plan will work.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.379
(grunts)

11:59.261 --> 12:01.468
(kick and grunts)

12:03.390 --> 12:06.223
He hasn't said a word.

12:07.227 --> 12:10.719
He's Luxan. He'll die first.

12:11.982 --> 12:15.145
Which means all this pain
has been for nothing.

12:17.112 --> 12:19.979
As it will continue to be.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.109
But perhaps you like pain.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.280
( screams )

12:23.368 --> 12:25.233
Is that it?

12:26.872 --> 12:28.203
I hope so.

12:28.290 --> 12:30.622
( screaming )

12:30.709 --> 12:32.324
I've changed my mind.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.035
Seven percent isn't nearly
enough. lwant ten.

12:35.130 --> 12:37.291
Listen slug, you'll get
what we agreed upon

12:37.382 --> 12:39.373
and you'll be happy
about it, okay?

12:39.468 --> 12:40.423
Okay?!

12:40.510 --> 12:42.501
It's easy, Rygel. Okay.

12:42.596 --> 12:46.180
Now, Stark's gadget will switch
our container for the
valuable one.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.472
Mm-hmm.

12:47.559 --> 12:48.469
Oh!

12:48.560 --> 12:50.096
And no Comms.
-What?

12:50.187 --> 12:52.018
All transmissions will
be detected.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.481
But what if something
goes wrong?

12:53.565 --> 12:55.430
We have complete confidence
in you, Rygel,

12:55.525 --> 12:57.436
especially where money
is concerned.

12:57.527 --> 12:58.562
( chuckles )

12:58.654 --> 13:00.610
Chiana, swallow this.

13:00.697 --> 13:03.609
It will protect you from the
effects of the melar gas.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.369
You ready, Rygel?

13:06.453 --> 13:10.116
(farting)

13:10.207 --> 13:12.414
(high voice):
Do I look ready?

13:12.501 --> 13:14.116
You have nothing to fear.

13:14.211 --> 13:16.577
The gas will suspend your
biological functions

13:16.672 --> 13:20.381
just long enough to avoid being
detected by a bioscan.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.332
Goddess be with you,

13:22.427 --> 13:23.883
brave Rygel.

13:25.389 --> 13:28.096
(high voice):
Ten percent! Do you hear me?!
Ten!

13:28.183 --> 13:32.517
I consider this an
oral contract...

13:32.604 --> 13:34.765
Strange. It should have
been instantaneous.

13:34.856 --> 13:37.063
I'll have to adjust the
mix next time.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.604
( chuckles )

13:40.696 --> 13:44.109
No, no, no! Wrong chip!
Bad chip!

13:46.535 --> 13:47.945
Bad!

13:48.036 --> 13:50.152
Crichton:
Have you accessed their
security systems yet?

13:50.247 --> 13:51.487
Soon.

13:51.581 --> 13:53.242
You said we had less
than six arns.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.368
I know what I said.

13:54.459 --> 13:56.871
That means you have less
than an am left.

13:58.463 --> 14:00.545
All bad.

14:00.632 --> 14:03.294
It's a matter of precision
and timing.

14:03.385 --> 14:06.718
I must create my link at
the precise moment they
reset their...

14:08.306 --> 14:09.682
I'm in.

14:10.642 --> 14:11.802
I'm in.

14:11.893 --> 14:13.269
Are you sure this is
going to work?

14:13.353 --> 14:16.095
Yes, it'll work. I spent too
much time thinking it through.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.931
I spent too much time thinking
through the Farscape project.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.436
Your side, my side!

14:20.527 --> 14:22.267
My side, your side!

14:22.362 --> 14:23.818
Now go away.

14:23.905 --> 14:26.237
You know, go back to your
quarters. Get something
to eat, take a nap.

14:26.324 --> 14:29.282
Do nothing. That's what
D'Argo said you do best.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.369
Ground rules.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.247
You don't lie to me.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.467
Did D'Argo say that?

14:45.260 --> 14:51.381
No. I'm sorry. He didn't.

14:51.475 --> 14:55.844
Do you have any other lies
you wanna confess?

14:55.937 --> 14:57.268
No.

15:04.988 --> 15:08.276
You wanna guilt trip me,
that's fine. Just...

15:09.618 --> 15:11.449
don't lie to me.

15:11.536 --> 15:13.948
Good. Good.

15:16.708 --> 15:19.415
(thunder crashing)

15:25.383 --> 15:27.169
This is it?

15:27.260 --> 15:29.171
Huh, lame.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.468
We can do better.

15:30.555 --> 15:32.216
Better is whatever I say it is.

15:32.307 --> 15:33.137
I knew that.

15:33.225 --> 15:34.180
May I help you?

15:34.267 --> 15:36.303
No. Bring me whoever's
in charge here.

15:36.394 --> 15:38.134
I assure you madam, I am
more than capable...

15:38.230 --> 15:39.686
Don't elevate yourself.

15:39.773 --> 15:42.640
I know a functionary when one
crawls in front of my face.

15:42.734 --> 15:44.816
Now fetch me your master like
a good little minion.

15:44.903 --> 15:46.734
l'm Natira.

15:48.198 --> 15:51.190
Are you here to make
a transaction?

15:51.284 --> 15:53.661
lam Orala.

15:53.745 --> 15:56.532
You act as if that name should
mean something to me.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.864
I understand you've been
having security problems.

15:58.959 --> 16:01.120
You've been misinformed.

16:01.211 --> 16:03.202
Oh, really?

16:03.296 --> 16:06.788
I had one of my operatives test
your systems himself.

16:06.883 --> 16:10.216
He got halfway into your vault
before you even noticed him.

16:10.303 --> 16:14.262
The Luxan? He barely made it
through the first door.

16:14.349 --> 16:15.555
He belongs to you?

16:15.642 --> 16:16.882
He's still alive?

16:16.977 --> 16:18.308
Last I checked.

16:18.395 --> 16:20.511
Chiana:
They couldn't even
kill a Luxan.

16:20.605 --> 16:22.266
Unbelievable.

16:22.357 --> 16:24.939
I will take him back now.

16:25.026 --> 16:26.982
You'll take whatever
I give you.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.185
Oh...

16:28.280 --> 16:29.941
How did he get our code?

16:30.031 --> 16:34.149
It is not myjob to plug
your security leak.

16:34.244 --> 16:36.701
Then why have you come here?

16:37.539 --> 16:39.154
Time sensitive goods.

16:39.249 --> 16:41.410
Short term deposit.
-Short term.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.117
I need storage for
one solar day.

16:44.212 --> 16:45.247
-One solar day.

16:48.258 --> 16:49.168
Explosives, negative.

16:49.259 --> 16:50.749
Biologicals, negative.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.380
Power-field emitters, negative.

16:53.513 --> 16:54.753
Hynerian?

16:54.848 --> 16:57.214
Yes. Naltoth era.

16:57.309 --> 17:01.143
Hmm, it's extremely ugly.

17:01.229 --> 17:03.220
But priceless.

17:04.441 --> 17:06.523
And now my Luxan.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.775
Natira:
This way, please.

17:15.285 --> 17:17.401
Take him back to the ship.
-At once.

17:17.954 --> 17:20.741
Freakin' Attila the Hun.

17:20.832 --> 17:22.823
Natira:
Your guards can watch you from
the observation room.

17:22.918 --> 17:24.374
He looks bad.

17:24.461 --> 17:27.544
Those are my rules, and if
you don't like them,
then leave. Now.

17:31.676 --> 17:34.167
The vault is made from
Maddium steel,

17:34.262 --> 17:37.675
strong enough to withstand
a Meta-vek explosion.

17:37.766 --> 17:39.882
Does that alleviate your
security concerns?

17:39.976 --> 17:41.432
I'll let you know in
one solar day.

17:41.519 --> 17:43.976
Please.
( beeping )

17:44.064 --> 17:46.976
The code to your container
is now linked to your
genetic profile.

17:47.067 --> 17:50.309
Computer:
Retrieving container.
-Only you will be able to gain access.

17:52.239 --> 17:54.605
Here comes your container now.

18:09.965 --> 18:13.173
The first time can be a
little intimidating.

18:13.260 --> 18:15.125
(rumbling)

18:21.935 --> 18:23.846
( beeping )

18:25.730 --> 18:27.231
Bonnie and Clyde.

18:27.315 --> 18:29.351
Oh no, forget about that one.
It's a bad ending.

18:29.442 --> 18:32.900
(whispering ):
Scorpius is here.
Natira should know.

18:36.074 --> 18:38.156
You know, it's really not
very nice to whisper.

18:38.243 --> 18:40.905
All right, Zhaan, come on.
Come on. Wrap it up.

18:40.996 --> 18:42.907
Scorpius:
You can't escape me.
You know that.

18:42.998 --> 18:45.580
Not now, you freak.
Get out of my head.

18:45.667 --> 18:46.702
You can't escape me.

18:46.793 --> 18:47.953
Scorpius.

18:48.044 --> 18:49.500
Yes, Scorpius.

18:49.587 --> 18:53.045
No... Scorpius.

18:54.759 --> 18:56.374
You see him?

19:00.265 --> 19:02.631
This is bad.

19:02.726 --> 19:04.808
This is very bad.

19:10.191 --> 19:11.226
(sighing)

19:11.318 --> 19:14.481
Akkor:
Scorpius? Scorpius?

19:14.571 --> 19:16.152
Scorpius:
Don't talk. I've come
for my property.

19:16.239 --> 19:19.197
Akkor:
If you could just be
a little patient.

19:19.284 --> 19:20.239
No...

19:20.327 --> 19:21.988
No, no, no, no.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.818
I must see Natira now.

19:23.913 --> 19:26.120
Yes, but...
-You're stalling me, Akkor.

19:26.207 --> 19:27.333
No.

19:27.417 --> 19:29.703
He's about to walk in on Zhaan.
We'd better warn her.

19:29.794 --> 19:32.285
We can't use the Comms
because they'll hear us.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.211
She'll be right with you.

19:34.299 --> 19:35.505
(growling impatiently)

19:35.592 --> 19:38.049
Please, understand.

19:38.136 --> 19:42.596
Natira's policy on client
confidentiality is very strict.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.638
I could lose my position.

19:44.726 --> 19:46.466
Of course.

19:46.561 --> 19:48.847
Oh, I understand.

19:50.398 --> 19:52.389
(groaning)

19:52.484 --> 19:54.270
Now it won't be your fault.

19:55.904 --> 19:57.144
(panting)

19:57.238 --> 19:58.364
Okay...

19:59.407 --> 20:01.193
All right.

20:01.284 --> 20:02.899
Hold still.

20:04.287 --> 20:06.073
What is that?

20:08.458 --> 20:11.040
My boy Scorpius.

20:22.138 --> 20:23.674
( beeping )

20:23.765 --> 20:25.471
(whirring )

20:27.185 --> 20:29.517
He's half Scarran.
Got a hell of a heat problem.

20:30.814 --> 20:32.850
That must be how he stays cool.

20:32.941 --> 20:35.273
Zhaan:
I trust your machinery will not
damage my possessions.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.692
Come on, Zhaan. Quit your
yakking and get out of there.

20:41.157 --> 20:42.772
Come on, Zhaan.

20:42.867 --> 20:45.574
...far more fragile and
valuable than yours.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.869
( beeps )

20:51.960 --> 20:53.791
(whispering ):
Scorpius is here.

20:53.878 --> 20:57.245
Natira:
If you'd allow my assistant
to escort you.

21:03.221 --> 21:04.711
Natira!

21:04.806 --> 21:07.138
Natira:
Scorpius!

21:09.060 --> 21:11.267
How good to see you.

21:14.315 --> 21:16.226
Follow me.

21:28.830 --> 21:32.288
I'm here to claim my property.

21:33.751 --> 21:37.243
Is that it?
Straight to business?

21:38.590 --> 21:39.545
(sighing)

21:39.632 --> 21:41.588
Scorpius.

21:41.676 --> 21:46.170
For a half Scarran, you can
sometimes be so... cold.

21:46.264 --> 21:47.970
( chuckles )

21:48.057 --> 21:50.969
We have so much to catch up on.

21:51.060 --> 21:53.722
I heard about the destruction
of your Gammak Base.

21:53.813 --> 21:56.190
And you thought I was dead.

21:56.274 --> 21:58.606
Well, I'm glad I was wrong.

21:58.693 --> 22:00.558
You've seized my property.

22:01.279 --> 22:02.689
Well...

22:02.780 --> 22:04.645
of course.

22:06.910 --> 22:10.949
But I'll provide you with
merchandise of equal value.

22:11.039 --> 22:14.531
No. For my inconvenience,
you'll provide me...

22:17.462 --> 22:19.669
with triple the value.

22:25.762 --> 22:27.298
Double.

22:30.767 --> 22:32.507
Triple.

22:36.105 --> 22:38.517
I'll make the arrangements.

22:39.651 --> 22:41.437
Hey, Stark, riddle me this.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.860
What's black and white
and black and white and
black and white?

22:43.947 --> 22:44.857
Scorpy.

22:44.948 --> 22:45.937
And in the bank.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.112
Here?

22:47.200 --> 22:48.781
You knew!

22:48.868 --> 22:51.951
You knew that he had a safe
deposit box in that bank.

22:52.038 --> 22:54.120
Oh, well...
-Uh-uh!

22:54.207 --> 22:56.198
We've talked about lying.

22:56.292 --> 22:58.829
Yes, I knew, but if
I told you...

22:58.920 --> 23:03.163
Hell, we would have stayed the
hell away from the bank!

23:03.258 --> 23:04.748
What the hell were you thinking?

23:04.842 --> 23:06.628
I didn't know he'd be here.

23:06.719 --> 23:10.303
No, no, no, no, you just want
to... you want to boost,
boost, boost his stuff!

23:10.390 --> 23:11.800
You just wanted revenge!

23:11.891 --> 23:13.427
That is not true!

23:13.518 --> 23:16.726
My people and D'Argo's son
are the reason I'm here.

23:16.813 --> 23:21.933
Now, if it's Scorpius's wealth
that frees them, well that's
an added bonus.

23:22.026 --> 23:23.607
You want revenge.

23:23.695 --> 23:25.276
No, I don't.

23:25.363 --> 23:27.194
I want to kill him.

23:27.282 --> 23:29.022
That's justice.

23:30.535 --> 23:31.775
How's D'Argo?

23:31.869 --> 23:33.245
Recovering.

23:33.329 --> 23:36.241
Pilot, is there any sign of
Scorpius's Command Carrier?

23:38.293 --> 23:42.081
But Moya did sense one small
vessel approaching the
planet earlier.

23:42.171 --> 23:46.289
Oh, that's fine. That's
probably just a Marauder on
a stealth trajectory.

23:46.384 --> 23:47.169
There's no need to panic.

23:47.260 --> 23:49.216
We can still pull this
off undetected.

23:49.304 --> 23:54.264
Look, I've modified these Comms
so that they'll encrypt all
transmissions.

23:54.350 --> 23:57.137
We can communicate safely
at all times.

23:57.228 --> 24:02.313
And this pass key has been
calibrated to control
all their doors.

24:02.400 --> 24:05.938
You see, this plan will work.

24:06.029 --> 24:09.396
In any event, we're committed.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.732
I need one more thing.

24:14.329 --> 24:15.284
( beeps )

24:16.122 --> 24:17.032
Zhaan?

24:17.123 --> 24:18.909
Zhaan:
Yes, John?

24:19.000 --> 24:22.913
Can you concoct something for
me that reacts with heat,

24:23.004 --> 24:26.747
and by react I mean explode?

24:26.841 --> 24:30.504
I can prepare some
jelifan paste.

24:30.595 --> 24:31.835
Do that, please.

24:31.929 --> 24:34.306
Don't turn this into a
vendetta, John.

24:35.350 --> 24:36.886
I didn't.

24:41.648 --> 24:46.017
l'm procuring a quarter sakmar
of Borinium ingots for you.

24:46.110 --> 24:48.852
At least three times the value
of the property you had stored.

24:48.946 --> 24:51.483
And where are you stealing
them from?

24:51.574 --> 24:53.781
Do you care?
-No.

24:53.868 --> 24:56.530
How soon will we have them?

24:56.621 --> 24:58.407
The arrangements are
rather complex.

24:58.498 --> 25:02.082
And what am I supposed to
do while I wait?

25:02.168 --> 25:04.750
Accept my apologies.

25:04.837 --> 25:07.920
Return to the Marauder.
I will summon you
if I need you.

25:08.007 --> 25:12.671
Leave that. Natira will tend
to me, should I require it.

25:12.762 --> 25:14.252
True.

25:14.347 --> 25:17.839
I know many ways to bleed off
your excess heat.

25:27.360 --> 25:28.975
Crichton:
How you doing?

25:29.070 --> 25:31.026
How do I look?

25:31.114 --> 25:33.275
You look like crap.

25:33.366 --> 25:35.732
Well, there's your answer.

25:35.827 --> 25:37.158
Blood's clear.

25:37.245 --> 25:38.826
Not much damage.

25:38.913 --> 25:40.244
He's still in a lot
of pain, though.

25:40.331 --> 25:42.287
Yeah, we're, uh...

25:42.375 --> 25:44.286
we're going ahead
with the plan.

25:44.377 --> 25:46.618
Because now it's begun,
you have no other choice.

25:46.713 --> 25:49.170
Now, who exactly got us into
this great plan, anyway?

25:49.257 --> 25:50.918
Well someone had to act.

25:51.008 --> 25:53.294
You mean someone had to take
matters into their own hands?

25:53.386 --> 25:54.341
What, and you never do?

25:54.429 --> 25:56.215
Crichton, just... just leave
him alone, okay.

25:56.305 --> 25:58.591
No, it's fine. If he wants to
get into it, we can get into it.

25:58.683 --> 26:01.265
Well yeah, sure.
Now's just a great time.

26:01.352 --> 26:05.345
Hey, how about | just go grab
some rags in case he starts
bleeding again.

26:10.778 --> 26:12.860
I didn't come here to fight.

26:12.947 --> 26:14.983
I came to see how you are.

26:15.074 --> 26:19.113
Well, we've already
covered that.

26:19.203 --> 26:21.285
Is there anything else?

26:26.043 --> 26:28.534
(thunder rumbling)

26:32.550 --> 26:34.541
Rygel:
One, get out of statue.

26:34.635 --> 26:37.377
Two, use gadget to
retrieve prize.

26:37.472 --> 26:41.556
Three, jump into containers
full of riches.

26:41.642 --> 26:44.679
The problem is... step one!

26:44.771 --> 26:47.513
(grunting and panting)

26:47.607 --> 26:52.021
Frell! The blue bitch said
this would be easy.

26:53.362 --> 26:56.320
Withdraw your possessions
akeady?

26:56.407 --> 26:57.317
Mm-hmm.

26:57.408 --> 26:59.444
That's unusual.

26:59.535 --> 27:01.617
My life is unusual.

27:01.704 --> 27:03.740
Chiana:
Very unusual.

27:03.831 --> 27:06.573
I said this was a
short term deposit.

27:06.667 --> 27:08.498
Short term.

27:11.047 --> 27:12.378
(grunting)

27:12.465 --> 27:14.797
(panting)

27:16.427 --> 27:19.760
Dren!
(grunts)

27:19.847 --> 27:23.339
No Dominar should have
to work this hard.

27:24.519 --> 27:26.225
(grunts)

27:27.021 --> 27:28.602
(panting)

27:28.689 --> 27:30.395
(mechanical whirring)

27:30.483 --> 27:34.817
All right, let's see if this
thing actually works.

27:45.623 --> 27:47.159
(whispering ):
So far, we're right
on schedule.

27:47.250 --> 27:48.831
(whispering ):
Let's hope Rygel is.

27:48.918 --> 27:50.704
All he's got to do is
switch containers.

27:50.795 --> 27:53.457
He gets it right, I got one
big kiss for him.

27:53.548 --> 27:55.334
(chuckling)

27:57.260 --> 27:58.420
What are you doing?

27:58.511 --> 28:00.172
Doing what guys do best.

28:00.263 --> 28:03.255
I'm looking for Baywatch.

28:07.728 --> 28:10.265
Better yet, the
Discovery Channel.

28:21.409 --> 28:23.115
Are you still angry with me?

28:23.202 --> 28:25.818
Mmm, furious.

28:26.831 --> 28:28.196
Good.

28:28.291 --> 28:31.283
It adds enthusiasm to
our encounters.

28:35.715 --> 28:38.081
(grunts)

28:40.344 --> 28:43.381
Leave the cooling rods. Leave
the cooling rods. Leave 'em.

28:43.472 --> 28:44.427
Perfect! Come on.

28:44.515 --> 28:46.346
Crichton...
-Let's go.

28:46.434 --> 28:47.514
( beeping )

28:47.602 --> 28:48.842
Computer:
Retrieving container.

28:48.936 --> 28:50.847
(gasping)

28:55.359 --> 28:57.850
( screaming )

29:08.205 --> 29:10.412
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

29:15.421 --> 29:16.831
Scorpius (whispering ):
Hello, John.

29:16.923 --> 29:18.754
Go. Go away.

29:24.305 --> 29:26.341
You, move that over there.

29:26.432 --> 29:27.672
Oh!

29:28.309 --> 29:29.640
Careful.

29:31.395 --> 29:33.101
Crichton:
Go away. Go.

29:33.189 --> 29:34.929
I cannot let you do this!
-Go away. Go away.

29:35.024 --> 29:36.013
Shh.

29:36.108 --> 29:37.848
It's just Scorpius.
He's in my ear.

29:37.944 --> 29:39.150
How about some jelifan paste...

29:39.236 --> 29:40.737
Put it down.
-In his ear?

29:40.821 --> 29:43.563
Stop it. Stop that.
Put it down.

29:43.658 --> 29:45.068
Get out.

29:45.159 --> 29:46.615
(whispering ):
Shut up.

29:46.702 --> 29:48.283
Put it down, John.
-I can do this.

29:48.371 --> 29:51.113
Put it down. I can't let you
do this. -I can do...
I can do this.

29:51.207 --> 29:53.823
No, John, lwon't let you.
I won't let you.

29:53.918 --> 29:56.079
No, you can't. Give it to me.

29:56.170 --> 29:58.126
Come on, Aeryn.
Come on, come on, come on.

29:58.214 --> 30:00.079
All right, all right,
aHnght

30:00.174 --> 30:01.835
(door opening)
Aeryn, Aeryn, quick.

30:01.926 --> 30:03.132
Okay.

30:03.219 --> 30:05.551
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it
up. Come on, come on, come on.

30:05.638 --> 30:07.128
Get down.

30:08.182 --> 30:09.262
(grunting)

30:24.573 --> 30:26.404
( beeping )

30:29.996 --> 30:34.956
The Borinium ingots have been
transferred into your
container.

30:35.042 --> 30:37.624
You'll be pleased with
their value.

30:37.712 --> 30:42.581
I'd better be similarly pleased
with their quantity.

30:42.675 --> 30:45.132
( Natira hisses )

30:45.219 --> 30:46.880
I will not be late for
my Taladine tea.

30:46.971 --> 30:49.257
You want to push?

30:49.348 --> 30:52.135
We'll be aboard the transport
shortly, Orala.

30:52.226 --> 30:54.182
( beeping )

30:55.312 --> 30:57.143
Borinium ingots?

30:57.231 --> 31:00.815
The Delvian woman.
These are her possessions.

31:00.901 --> 31:02.562
A Delvian?
-Security lockdown.

31:02.653 --> 31:04.029
Who was with her?

31:04.113 --> 31:06.229
A Nebari, a Luxan and
two Sebaceans.

31:06.323 --> 31:08.655
Crichton! Seal all exits!

31:08.743 --> 31:11.405
(alarm pulsating )

31:11.495 --> 31:13.156
( growls )

31:16.542 --> 31:17.952
Frell!

31:20.838 --> 31:22.203
(grunts)

31:25.718 --> 31:27.208
Frell.

31:27.303 --> 31:29.635
Time to try Stark's lockpick.

31:29.722 --> 31:31.258
( beeping )

31:31.348 --> 31:33.054
Nuh, time to try
something else.

31:33.142 --> 31:34.052
Zhaan.

31:34.143 --> 31:35.303
Zhaan!

31:37.188 --> 31:38.177
Zhaan!

31:38.272 --> 31:41.230
Get away from the portal.

31:41.317 --> 31:43.148
The doors are sealed, Aeryn.
What's happening?

31:43.235 --> 31:44.941
Scorpius must be on to us.

31:46.030 --> 31:46.940
Stupid plan.

31:47.031 --> 31:48.362
Very stupid plan.

31:48.449 --> 31:50.360
Don't panic.
Hold your position.

31:51.285 --> 31:52.320
Do we have a choice?

31:52.411 --> 31:54.117
Stark? Stark! Pick up!

31:54.205 --> 31:56.947
I want him captured,
not deafened.

31:57.041 --> 31:59.703
This facility is bristule
tight. They won't get out.

31:59.794 --> 32:03.161
l have less than a skerrick of
faith in your words, Natila.

32:03.255 --> 32:04.210
Locate them now.

32:04.298 --> 32:06.163
This wasn't supposed to happen.

32:06.258 --> 32:07.464
Wasn't supposed to happen.

32:07.551 --> 32:09.212
Yes, well it did.

32:09.303 --> 32:12.215
Now, can you pinpoint our
location and turn off
the damn camera?

32:12.306 --> 32:13.091
I'm here.

32:15.392 --> 32:18.600
What the frell?!
They're jamming the cameras.

32:18.687 --> 32:21.770
Give me your level, corridor,
segment, in that order.

32:21.857 --> 32:24.189
Stark, this gizmo you gave me.

32:24.276 --> 32:26.562
It's supposed to give me
control over all the doors.

32:26.654 --> 32:30.067
Yes. Yes, but they'll know
right where you are.
It's best to let me...

32:30.157 --> 32:32.113
Just give me control!

32:32.201 --> 32:37.286
Stark. You and D'Argo get
Zhaan, Chiana and Rygel out and
we'll act as a diversion.

32:37.373 --> 32:38.863
That is suicide, Aeryn.

32:38.958 --> 32:43.247
Almost as suicidal as strolling
in and walking through a
security door.

32:45.422 --> 32:46.673
Camera function restored.

32:46.757 --> 32:48.668
A portal's been breached,
level nineteen.

32:49.343 --> 32:50.332
Is it Crichton?

32:50.427 --> 32:52.839
We can't be sure until we...
-Make sure.

32:54.306 --> 32:55.807
Scorpius:
Stop running.

32:57.101 --> 32:59.057
You cannot resist.

32:59.145 --> 33:01.352
What is the matter with you?

33:03.691 --> 33:05.306
What is wrong?

33:06.235 --> 33:07.850
Aeryn, Scorpy.

33:12.324 --> 33:14.030
(voices approaching )
Guards.

33:20.249 --> 33:22.240
Oh, hell.

33:22.334 --> 33:23.870
Got an idea.

33:25.254 --> 33:28.462
Take your first on the right.

33:28.549 --> 33:31.086
Rygel:
Ten percent of this
plan is lunacy.

33:31.177 --> 33:33.338
Fifty percent of these riches
is not enough!

33:33.429 --> 33:35.340
One hundred percent of
dead is dead!

33:35.431 --> 33:36.546
Stark, which way now?

33:36.640 --> 33:38.892
(Stark mumbles)
Stark!

33:38.976 --> 33:40.216
D'Argo, are you there?

33:40.311 --> 33:42.723
Stark, they need you.

33:42.813 --> 33:45.555
If you fail them,
I'll kill you.

33:45.649 --> 33:47.310
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
this will work.

33:47.401 --> 33:49.187
Trust me. We just have to
find a place to...
-This will never work.

33:49.278 --> 33:51.109
get our clothes off.
-You two. Hold it.

33:51.197 --> 33:52.733
They went that way.

33:52.823 --> 33:54.279
Level twenty two, corridor
riga, segment trada five.

33:54.366 --> 33:57.278
They must be overriding
portal controls.
-Not possible.

33:57.369 --> 34:00.361
Notify me constantly
of their progress.

34:00.456 --> 34:02.447
This is my facility, Scorpius.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.497
You go nowhere without me.

34:04.585 --> 34:06.200
Nat...

34:06.754 --> 34:08.415
( growls )

34:10.090 --> 34:11.500
Natira.

34:11.592 --> 34:15.255
How much do you owe me?

34:16.555 --> 34:18.762
In every way?

34:20.017 --> 34:23.259
Too much, that I cannot repay.

34:23.354 --> 34:28.269
If I leave with this man in
custody, then all is forgiven.

34:34.907 --> 34:36.272
Blue, how you doing?

34:36.367 --> 34:39.234
We're almost to the central
processing area, John.

34:42.248 --> 34:44.239
Stark, open the last door.

34:44.333 --> 34:45.914
Stark:
Not the plan, not the plan,
not the plan.

34:46.001 --> 34:47.866
My fault, my fault, my fault.

34:47.962 --> 34:50.453
They're almost out of there.
Come on, you can do it.

34:50.547 --> 34:54.165
Stark. Stark, open the door.

34:54.260 --> 34:56.251
I can hear them coming.

34:57.096 --> 34:58.302
Stark!

35:03.519 --> 35:05.350
Scorpius:
John, I need you.

35:05.437 --> 35:06.597
Aeryn.
-What?

35:06.689 --> 35:08.145
If Scorpius gets me...

35:08.232 --> 35:09.597
I know, shoot you.

35:09.692 --> 35:11.728
No. No, no, no. Shoot him.

35:11.819 --> 35:13.025
Look, we have to talk.

35:13.112 --> 35:14.977
Not here. You'll get
us both killed.

35:15.072 --> 35:18.235
Aeryn, l have to tell
you how I feel.

35:18.325 --> 35:19.314
l have to tell you.

35:19.410 --> 35:21.696
No, you don't.
-Yes, I do.

35:21.787 --> 35:22.902
I do.

35:22.997 --> 35:24.612
No, you don't.

35:27.293 --> 35:28.373
Natira, report.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.496
Crichton's heading towards
the main chamber.

35:30.587 --> 35:33.715
Your current vector will
intercept him.

35:33.799 --> 35:37.712
The Delvian still has the
special reserve you
intended for Scorpius.

35:37.803 --> 35:40.340
Good luck to her.
The least of our worries.

35:40.431 --> 35:42.171
They're coming, D'Argo. Hurry!

35:42.266 --> 35:44.131
I am working on it.

35:44.226 --> 35:45.887
Just frelling hurry.

35:45.978 --> 35:48.936
Chiana, have you got your pill
for the melar gas? Take it now.

35:49.023 --> 35:51.639
Where's my pill?
This time | get a pill.

35:53.319 --> 35:54.525
We have to reach them quickly.

35:54.611 --> 35:57.478
l'm following the frelling
sequence!

35:58.949 --> 36:03.113
That's it, D'Argo.
You're back in their system.

36:03.203 --> 36:07.287
A pill for Rygel? Of course
not. When did anyone
think of me?

36:07.374 --> 36:08.534
Stand your ground! Don't move!

36:08.625 --> 36:10.240
We'll shoot if you resist.

36:13.047 --> 36:14.833
Don't think about it.

36:18.385 --> 36:20.501
Oh, frell!

36:24.516 --> 36:25.892
Much better.

36:25.976 --> 36:28.217
I knew I had to adjust the mix.
(both laughing)

36:28.312 --> 36:30.724
Natira:
Crichton's out racing you to
the main chamber.

36:30.814 --> 36:32.270
Move it, Scorpius.

36:32.358 --> 36:33.518
Capture them.

36:33.609 --> 36:36.191
Take Crichton, alive.

36:36.278 --> 36:39.065
We must change your cooling
rods. You're burning through
them too fast.

36:39.156 --> 36:40.896
( growls )

36:44.161 --> 36:47.119
Oh, thank the goddess
you made it.

36:47.206 --> 36:48.366
ls Rygel dead?

36:48.457 --> 36:50.197
( Scorpius wispers in
John's head )
Unconscious.

36:50.292 --> 36:53.204
Aeryn, you help them load. I'm
gonna go seal all the doors.

36:53.295 --> 36:56.002
No, reverse that, John.
You do this, I'll do that.

36:56.090 --> 36:58.672
Scorpius:
There's no escape.
-This is mine.

36:58.759 --> 37:00.169
Load.

37:20.322 --> 37:21.937
John...

37:35.337 --> 37:36.952
Braca:
Come on.

37:40.884 --> 37:42.294
Hold it!
-Come on, Braca.

37:42.386 --> 37:43.501
Hold it!

37:43.971 --> 37:45.302
Help me!

37:48.350 --> 37:50.261
( screams )

37:50.352 --> 37:52.058
Thank you.

37:52.146 --> 37:53.807
Hey, Braca.

37:53.897 --> 37:58.311
Tell me, is the rematch ever
better than the original fight?

37:59.903 --> 38:01.689
Hmm?Hmm?Hmm?

38:16.920 --> 38:20.913
You have no idea how patient I
have been for this moment.

38:21.008 --> 38:24.216
Well, since I got you
here, tell me.

38:24.303 --> 38:26.840
What the frell did you
put in my head?!

38:27.347 --> 38:29.133
Some awareness.

38:29.683 --> 38:31.924
A neuro-biotracer.

38:32.019 --> 38:34.977
Call it what you like.

38:36.148 --> 38:37.513
A tiny chip,

38:37.608 --> 38:41.317
a tiny seed that's been
growing in your brain.

38:41.403 --> 38:45.521
Touching every aspect
of your personality...

38:45.616 --> 38:48.198
your memory.

38:48.285 --> 38:51.118
Didn't happen to see
LuAnne Johnson, did ya?

38:51.205 --> 38:53.070
And whispering advice.

38:53.165 --> 38:58.580
I trust it's helped save you
once or twice since escaping
my Gammak Base.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.410
(gasping)

39:04.009 --> 39:05.874
Oh, what's the matter Scorpy?

39:05.969 --> 39:07.345
You don't look too good.

39:07.429 --> 39:09.511
Neither do you, Crichton.

39:09.598 --> 39:12.089
(groaning)

39:12.184 --> 39:17.178
I got a piece of you in me.
Now you got a piece of
me in you.

39:20.359 --> 39:21.769
Change it.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.191
Change it now!

39:23.278 --> 39:24.734
Scorpius.

39:45.008 --> 39:50.002
You could not let me die any
more than I can sacrifice you.

39:50.097 --> 39:54.090
That's what you're telling me
in my head, but I think I'll
give it a shot.

39:54.184 --> 39:57.642
No, you will save me.

39:57.729 --> 39:59.014
No.

39:59.106 --> 40:01.142
Now, take one. Take it.

40:01.233 --> 40:03.189
No!

40:03.277 --> 40:04.562
Take it.

40:05.237 --> 40:06.568
Take it!

40:07.281 --> 40:08.817
Take it!

40:12.953 --> 40:15.615
Now insert the rod
in the gannet.
-No.

40:17.207 --> 40:18.947
Insert the rod!

40:24.214 --> 40:26.421
Insert the rod!

40:27.426 --> 40:29.257
Insert it!

40:29.344 --> 40:32.802
Insert it! Insert it!
Insert it!

40:32.889 --> 40:35.551
Insert the rod, John!

40:37.311 --> 40:39.723
You're really not my type.

40:41.940 --> 40:46.309
Die, you grotesque bastard!

40:46.403 --> 40:49.315
Even if it means I die, too.

40:51.033 --> 40:55.242
Neither one of us can die.

40:55.329 --> 41:00.039
(John sings)
Oh, say can you see...

41:00.125 --> 41:06.041
I command you to help me.
-By the dawn's early light...

41:06.131 --> 41:10.465
John Crichton, I command
you to help me!
-What so proudly we hail...

41:10.552 --> 41:15.842
At the twilight's last
gleaming...

41:15.932 --> 41:20.847
Whose broad stripes and
bright stars...

41:28.945 --> 41:31.197
(grunting)

41:37.746 --> 41:41.204
Rygel:
We've done it! We are rich!

41:41.291 --> 41:45.125
As soon as we establish an
exchange rate for these ingots,

41:45.212 --> 41:47.328
we'll know exactly how
rich we really are.

41:47.422 --> 41:51.335
We agreed, Rygel, nothing gets
touched until after D'Argo's
son and the others

41:51.426 --> 41:53.337
get freed from the slave
auction, right?

41:53.428 --> 41:58.172
Yes, yes, let's all pretend
we're not thinking how
ill-advised that covenant was.

41:58.266 --> 42:01.349
He provides a perspective
otherwise lacking.

42:01.436 --> 42:03.688
I must apologize for my panic.

42:03.772 --> 42:05.512
My shame is great.

42:05.607 --> 42:08.519
You did brilliantly. We
wouldn't have had a chance
without you.

42:08.610 --> 42:10.896
For which I am
eternally grateful.

42:10.987 --> 42:12.602
Ka D'Argo.

42:12.698 --> 42:15.861
You've proven yourself to
be a worthy friend.

42:15.951 --> 42:18.988
And one not to be
distrusted again.

42:23.959 --> 42:26.291
Nice sentiment.

42:26.378 --> 42:30.587
After all these desolate cycles,
I'm about to see my son.

42:30.674 --> 42:34.337
And that tortured being there
is the one who's made
it possible.

42:34.428 --> 42:38.012
What about your other
tortured friend?

42:38.098 --> 42:42.387
Friends support one another
unconditionally.

42:42.477 --> 42:45.093
They also forgive one another.

42:59.411 --> 43:01.322
It was real.

43:03.165 --> 43:05.577
I didn't imagine it.

43:07.169 --> 43:09.376
What was real, John?

43:18.805 --> 43:21.182
I had Scorpius in my head.

43:25.771 --> 43:29.764
And it was hard letting him die.

43:32.527 --> 43:36.987
There's still a part of me that
wishes l'd saved him.

43:37.073 --> 43:39.109
Well, you mustn't forget what
he wanted from you.

43:39.201 --> 43:41.988
He wanted to dissect
your brain.

43:47.584 --> 43:49.245
Hmm.

43:53.340 --> 43:56.082
Aeryn, I, um...

44:00.347 --> 44:02.929
I meant what I said...

44:03.475 --> 44:05.511
didn't say.

44:14.402 --> 44:16.188
I know.

44:32.254 --> 44:34.290
( rattling )
