WEBVTT

00:32.933 --> 00:36.036
(loud music, indistinct chatter)

00:39.540 --> 00:41.542
DEWEY:
Officer down!

00:41.542 --> 00:44.645
I'm in the
freakin' bedroom!

00:48.549 --> 00:50.284
Come on!
I'm in the bedroom!

00:50.284 --> 00:51.852
Come and get me!

00:51.852 --> 00:53.554
(John laughs)

00:53.554 --> 00:55.022
Come on, man.

00:55.022 --> 00:56.224
This is a...

00:56.224 --> 00:58.292
(man laughing)

00:58.292 --> 00:59.927
Is he wearing
underwear?

00:59.927 --> 01:01.028
I don't know.

01:01.028 --> 01:02.230
It's funny, right?

01:02.230 --> 01:04.932
Come on. Just give
the key. Unlock me.

01:04.932 --> 01:05.899
Come on. Just unlock me!

01:05.899 --> 01:07.435
No, no, don't do that.

01:07.435 --> 01:08.602
That's not right.
That's not right! Don't!

01:08.602 --> 01:11.639
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:11.639 --> 01:13.641
MAN:
Three officers
started out the day

01:13.641 --> 01:15.576
thinking they had
nothing in common.

01:15.576 --> 01:20.548
By end of shift, two of them
found out this was not true.

01:20.548 --> 01:22.216
What happened
to Dr. Breslow?

01:22.216 --> 01:26.220
He retired rather
suddenly, I'm afraid.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.090
Did he get shot?
What? Uh, no.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.759
No?
No. No, no...

01:31.759 --> 01:33.861
I thought maybe a hostage
situation or something.

01:33.861 --> 01:35.028
Yeah...

01:35.028 --> 01:36.297
(laughs)
Yes.

01:36.297 --> 01:38.432
How long you
been doing this?

01:38.432 --> 01:40.934
Um, this is
my second day.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.070
Your sec... All right.

01:43.070 --> 01:44.638
Well, you're doing good.

01:44.638 --> 01:45.606
(laughs)

01:45.606 --> 01:47.475
Well, uh, thank
you very much.

01:47.475 --> 01:48.609
Oh, sure.

01:48.609 --> 01:51.579
What kind of practice
did you have before this?

01:51.579 --> 01:53.514
Private.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.416
The, uh, well-off worried.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.585
Should their kids transfer

01:57.585 --> 01:59.653
from Crossroads
to Harvard-Westlake?

01:59.653 --> 02:02.022
Someone got a better facelift
than someone else.

02:02.022 --> 02:03.824
That sort of thing.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.226
I went to Harvard-Westlake.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.994
Oh.

02:06.994 --> 02:09.697
I transferred out
after a semester.

02:09.697 --> 02:12.366
My father stopped paying
the tuition.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.703
How'd you feel about that?

02:15.703 --> 02:16.770
What?

02:16.770 --> 02:19.173
How did you
feel about that?

02:19.173 --> 02:20.741
(chuckles)

02:20.741 --> 02:23.311
I was pretty confused
at that point.

02:23.311 --> 02:25.513
My, uh...

02:25.513 --> 02:27.548
My father walked out
on my mom and me.

02:27.548 --> 02:30.150
We were living in this big house
off of Sunset.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.719
(sighs)

02:31.719 --> 02:34.255
And I started going
to public school.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.959
Dr. Breslow...

02:38.959 --> 02:40.294
(clears his throat)

02:40.294 --> 02:42.196
...mentioned
that there was...

02:42.196 --> 02:43.631
(papers riffling)

02:43.631 --> 02:46.033
...a violent incident
in your childhood.

02:46.033 --> 02:48.168
Is that right?

02:49.670 --> 02:53.207
Would you mind my asking
what happened?

02:55.376 --> 02:57.378
My father's a defense attorney.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.947
One of his clients broke
into our house.

02:59.947 --> 03:02.015
My father had already split.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.618
My mom and I were there.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.420
Go on.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.256
They beat her up.

03:08.256 --> 03:10.090
You saw this?

03:10.090 --> 03:12.993
Yeah, I did.

03:12.993 --> 03:14.628
How old were you?

03:14.628 --> 03:17.431
I was ten.

03:17.431 --> 03:18.766
So you're ten
years old,

03:18.766 --> 03:20.801
your father
walks out on you,

03:20.801 --> 03:22.936
drug dealers beat
up your Mom, and...

03:22.936 --> 03:24.372
it's fine?

03:24.372 --> 03:25.973
And now I'm a cop.

03:25.973 --> 03:27.908
Thank you, Dr. Freud.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.846
(sighs)

03:32.846 --> 03:35.583
Says here that this
is your last session.

03:36.817 --> 03:39.520
How do you feel
about the shooting?

03:42.155 --> 03:44.558
I'm okay with it.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.494
(sighs)

03:47.895 --> 03:49.863
I didn't enjoy it.

03:49.863 --> 03:52.065
It was unavoidable.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.901
Some guys, they work 20 years,

03:53.901 --> 03:56.970
they never have
to shoot anybody.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.772
It's just weird.

03:58.772 --> 04:01.442
How much it means
to guys like that.

04:01.442 --> 04:02.976
I'm okay with it.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.645
Good.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.880
Good.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.482
Good. All right.

04:08.482 --> 04:10.618
Well, I'm gonna go to work.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.920
All right,
well, I, uh...

04:12.920 --> 04:14.922
I wish you luck.

04:14.922 --> 04:17.024
Yeah, you, too.

04:21.795 --> 04:24.298
So that wraps it
up there, right?

04:24.298 --> 04:26.567
Yup.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.302
Being from Beverly
Hills and all,

04:28.302 --> 04:30.137
you must have been
in lots of therapy.

04:30.137 --> 04:32.740
Yeah, it's definitely
not my first time at the rodeo.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.908
What about you?
You ever been in therapy?

04:34.908 --> 04:36.109
Yeah.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.245
When my marriage ended.

04:38.245 --> 04:39.680
It was good.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.850
Worked some things out.

04:43.984 --> 04:46.086
DISPATCH:
Six Adam 43, see the man.

04:46.086 --> 04:49.323
Possible stolen vehicle
at 455 Tiffany Circle.

04:49.323 --> 04:50.824
What the hell
does that mean?

05:02.135 --> 05:04.538
Donte, Po-po's here.

05:14.648 --> 05:18.218
Yeah. All right. Peace.

05:18.218 --> 05:21.689
Sir, your car was stolen?

05:21.689 --> 05:22.990
Yeah.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.392
Azure got jacked.

05:24.392 --> 05:25.626
Playoffs coming up, dude.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.628
I can't be in that
kind of trouble.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.329
Can you be
more specific?

05:30.364 --> 05:33.000
Went out last night,
hit some places,

05:33.000 --> 05:34.368
came home,

05:34.368 --> 05:37.004
some people came to chill,
Bentley Azure got jacked.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.306
So you want to file
a police report

05:39.306 --> 05:40.708
for a stolen vehicle?

05:40.708 --> 05:43.911
You ever go for some strange?

05:43.911 --> 05:45.212
Excuse me?

05:45.212 --> 05:46.580
All right.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.048
All right,
come here.

05:48.048 --> 05:50.050
Come here.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.819
(clears throat)

05:51.819 --> 05:53.454
I'm married,
all right?

05:53.454 --> 05:55.623
My wife is in St. Barts
with Donte Junior.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.057
She has this dog,

05:57.057 --> 05:58.559
a Great Dane.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.528
I don't give a fuck
about the car.

06:00.528 --> 06:01.729
Insurance'll cover it,

06:01.729 --> 06:04.297
but you got to get me
the dog back.

06:04.297 --> 06:06.233
Now, she comes
home tomorrow.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.035
Got to get me the dog.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.604
I got some pictures of
it somewhere around here.

06:10.604 --> 06:15.242
Sir, do you or do you not
want to file a police report?

06:15.242 --> 06:16.544
I'm married,
motherfucker,

06:16.544 --> 06:18.111
I can't be
filing no report.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.379
(chuckles)

06:19.379 --> 06:20.814
So, women took the car?

06:20.814 --> 06:22.783
Yeah, women took the car.

06:22.783 --> 06:24.317
And you don't want
to file a report?

06:24.317 --> 06:26.286
You ain't
listening, bro.

06:26.286 --> 06:28.889
Protect and serve,
motherfucker.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.158
You got something
against me? I got rights.

06:32.693 --> 06:36.564
Sir, you have
to file a police report.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.532
We're not private detectives.

06:38.532 --> 06:39.700
All right.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.535
All right. All right.

06:41.535 --> 06:42.936
I got a better idea.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.104
I go with you.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.105
We go looking around.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.074
I got some ideas
where the bitches be at.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.976
Wait here. Let me
change, all right?

06:48.976 --> 06:50.944
Ten, 15 minutes.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.562
I can't even...

07:08.562 --> 07:12.733
DISPATCH:
15 Adam 85, a possible overdose
at 3321 Mulholland.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.067
Possible overdose now.

07:14.067 --> 07:17.104
Two-seven-nine-one,
RD-one-five-seven nine.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.673
He said they'd been doing drugs,
she started to choke.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.008
I guess she was overdosing.

07:21.008 --> 07:22.943
He said they'd been
partying hard all night.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.745
Anyway, she's choking,
he panics,

07:24.745 --> 07:27.581
says he wanted
to give her a tracheotomy.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.717
I guess he missed.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.271
So, I guess
it's a suspicious death, right?

07:51.271 --> 07:52.940
No.

07:52.940 --> 07:55.776
No, it's not
a suspicious death.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.277
This isn't a frigging
Agatha Christie novel.

07:57.277 --> 07:59.747
There's accidental
death, there's suicide,

07:59.747 --> 08:01.148
and then there's homicide.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.816
This is homicide.
He's going in for murder.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.686
You should give him one
of your dad's cards.

08:05.686 --> 08:08.321
This guy-- he's gonna
need a good lawyer.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.790
Let's go.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.291
Why are you
arresting me?

08:11.291 --> 08:12.626
I tried to
save her life!

08:12.626 --> 08:14.762
With a Bic pen?

08:24.538 --> 08:28.175
(horn honking)

08:28.175 --> 08:30.110
JOHN:
I just got shot.
Where are we?

08:30.110 --> 08:30.944
I don't know.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.045
Every time I make a turn,

08:32.045 --> 08:33.480
you look up at
the street sign.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.015
You got to know
where we are at all times.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.284
All right, I got it.
This is it. This is it.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.619
(tires squeaking)

08:38.619 --> 08:40.020
(shouting)
CHICKIE:
Put it down right now!

08:40.020 --> 08:41.555
Shoot her! Shoot her!
Shoot her! Shoot her!

08:41.555 --> 08:42.856
I spent all weekend
with this scumbag,

08:42.856 --> 08:44.024
and then he stops payment
on the check?!

08:44.024 --> 08:45.525
Ma'am, put the gun down
right now!

08:45.525 --> 08:46.293
Leave me alone!
She's gonna shoot me!

08:46.293 --> 08:47.494
I spent three days

08:47.494 --> 08:48.161
with this scumbag,
and then he...

08:48.161 --> 08:50.898
Put it down!

08:50.898 --> 08:51.965
Ma'am, put the gun down.
Please. I'm sorry.

08:51.965 --> 08:53.366
We'll deal
with that later.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.702
Put the gun down
right now!
Put the gun down!

08:54.702 --> 08:56.203
Put the gun down
right now!

08:56.203 --> 08:57.671
Put the gun down.
Please don't shoot me.

08:57.671 --> 08:58.706
I'm begging you.
I'm begging you.

08:58.706 --> 09:00.073
Please, don't, don't.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.942
Yeah. Oh, get her.
Get her! Get her!

09:01.942 --> 09:03.577
Get her! Get her! Get her!
She's-She's gonna kill me.

09:03.577 --> 09:05.278
Sir, turn around, put
your hands on the car.
What?

09:05.278 --> 09:07.047
Turn around, put your hands
on the car, spread your legs.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.849
I got to search you.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. No...

09:08.849 --> 09:10.450
Put your hands
on the car.
I'm the star of the movie.

09:10.450 --> 09:12.352
That's Timmy
freakin' Davis, man.

09:12.352 --> 09:13.553
I thought you retired.

09:13.553 --> 09:14.922
Retired? Bitch
filed for divorce.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.590
She wants half
my pension?

09:16.590 --> 09:17.557
Hell with that.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.959
Besides, I miss you guys.

09:18.959 --> 09:20.027
WOMAN:
Why don't you
arrest him?

09:20.027 --> 09:21.629
I spent three days with him,

09:21.629 --> 09:23.631
doing every single thing he
wants, and he bounces the check?

09:23.631 --> 09:25.265
We were so high, I don't
even remember your name.

09:25.265 --> 09:26.634
I'll write you another...
(loud, overlapping chatter)

09:26.634 --> 09:27.935
Hey.
It was a
misunderstanding.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.202
I didn't have enough
money in my account.

09:29.202 --> 09:30.638
I'm a big fan, man.
I love your movies.

09:30.638 --> 09:31.839
Really?
I'm a huge fan.

09:31.839 --> 09:33.273
You should be.
I love Bodybag.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.742
Oh, Bodybag II's
coming out in the fall.

09:34.742 --> 09:35.843
It's the bomb.
Oh, sweet.

09:35.843 --> 09:37.077
All right, okay,
you know what?

09:37.077 --> 09:38.245
You got to go down
to the station,

09:38.245 --> 09:40.013
talk this over
with the detectives.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.481
Oh, no. I-I'm work...
I'm shooting a movie right now.

09:41.481 --> 09:43.483
I understand that.
Look, we can smooth this out.

09:43.483 --> 09:44.451
JOHN:
Smooth it out?

09:44.451 --> 09:45.619
What are you...?

09:45.619 --> 09:46.920
You know what?
Maybe you should retire.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.521
She's pointing
a loaded gun at him.

09:48.521 --> 09:49.823
This is ADW, okay?
She's going to jail.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.358
Hey, look, look.
Come on, guys.

09:51.358 --> 09:53.827
I'll just write her
another check. No big deal.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.362
You see? He'll
write another check!

09:55.362 --> 09:56.229
Yeah, and I'm...
All right?

09:56.229 --> 09:57.297
How about we clear it up

09:57.297 --> 09:58.565
with the detectives
down at the station?

09:58.565 --> 09:59.733
Or we can do that.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.568
I got him.

10:01.568 --> 10:02.770
I got him. I got him.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.437
You go with her, okay?
I got him.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.405
Give me the
weapon.

10:05.405 --> 10:06.606
Okay.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.041
Come on,
let's go.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.376
Okay.
Let's go.

10:09.376 --> 10:10.377
Let's go.
Let's go.

10:10.377 --> 10:12.479
Officer, uh, Dudeck is it? Okay.

10:12.479 --> 10:13.681
Bring him in, Dewey.

10:13.681 --> 10:14.882
(mumbling)
All right.
All right.

10:14.882 --> 10:17.384
You start taking
witness statements.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.922
Come here.

10:21.922 --> 10:24.191
I'll get your cuffs
back to you.

10:30.063 --> 10:32.465
You're booking him for murder?

10:32.465 --> 10:34.167
Yes, we are.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.435
This isn't a murder!

10:35.435 --> 10:37.237
I didn't murder anyone!

10:37.237 --> 10:39.639
Well, when the coroner's
report comes back, we'll see.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.009
Oh.
But right now,
it's 187 PC.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.711
And you're bailing
him out anyway,

10:43.711 --> 10:46.747
so what's the difference?
Victim's sister
is here.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.916
He was trying to help her.

10:48.916 --> 10:50.851
He should get an award for this.

10:50.851 --> 10:53.353
Right. You get awards
for saving lives,

10:53.353 --> 10:55.322
not taking them.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.523
Ms. Campbell?

10:56.523 --> 10:57.791
Mm-hmm.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.659
Why don't you
have a seat?

10:59.659 --> 11:00.861
Okay?

11:00.861 --> 11:02.495
Well, just-just tell me.

11:02.495 --> 11:06.233
She's... She's dead, right?

11:06.233 --> 11:08.769
Yes. I'm very sorry.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.172
She OD'd, right?

11:12.172 --> 11:14.241
Well, we're not
exactly sure.

11:14.241 --> 11:16.443
What the hell
does that mean?

11:16.443 --> 11:18.511
She was doing some drugs.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.513
She passed out,

11:20.513 --> 11:22.515
and the man who she was with

11:22.515 --> 11:25.318
tried to do a tracheotomy
on her.

11:25.318 --> 11:28.856
And he... he cut
her carotid artery,

11:28.856 --> 11:31.058
and she bled to death.

11:38.331 --> 11:39.933
There was no reason
for him to leave the set

11:39.933 --> 11:41.268
in the first place.
He was...

11:41.268 --> 11:42.836
I understand.
We're working on it.

11:42.836 --> 11:45.205
All right? Good luck.
Good luck on the movie.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.573
Yeah.

11:46.573 --> 11:47.741
Is that the director?

11:47.741 --> 11:49.176
Oh, yeah.

11:49.176 --> 11:50.577
Yeah.

11:50.577 --> 11:51.745
Dude!

11:51.745 --> 11:52.913
Hold on, baby.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.314
What's up?

11:54.314 --> 11:55.883
Hey, guess what.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.317
I, uh... I did
hire your dad,

11:57.317 --> 11:59.252
and I hooked up
with your sister again.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.521
We're all going out tonight.
You want to cruise?

12:01.521 --> 12:04.424
Baby, yeah. Guess who
I'm standing here with?

12:04.424 --> 12:06.359
Yeah. It's for you.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.763
Hey, Olivia. Yeah?

12:09.763 --> 12:11.431
(chuckles)

12:11.431 --> 12:13.466
Want to search my trailer?

12:13.466 --> 12:16.036
(chuckles)

12:16.036 --> 12:18.171
Yeah, I'll call you
later.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.973
Yeah.

12:19.973 --> 12:22.109
So you coming out tonight
or what?

12:27.080 --> 12:29.282
(laughing):
Yeah, baby, isn't
that crazy?

12:29.282 --> 12:31.218
I know.

12:34.021 --> 12:36.089
You think you guys are
the only ones who work?

12:36.089 --> 12:37.324
Keep me waiting for an hour?

12:40.560 --> 12:42.896
JOHN:
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.766
Therapy in the morning,

12:46.766 --> 12:49.769
a little chitchat
on the phone.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.039
You want to go to
Spago for lunch?

12:52.039 --> 12:53.640
I hate that place.
Guys are too old.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.275
Shut up!

12:57.177 --> 12:58.778
What the hell
are you doing?

13:00.480 --> 13:02.482
People become cops for
two reasons, all right.

13:02.482 --> 13:03.951
They need the paycheck

13:03.951 --> 13:06.319
or they like to carry a big gun
and tell people what to do.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.121
All right, now you--

13:08.121 --> 13:11.124
you surely don't
need the money.

13:11.124 --> 13:15.128
I don't think
you're a freak.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.164
So what the hell are
you doing here?

13:17.164 --> 13:18.899
I'm a cop,
same as you're a cop.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.367
Bullshit, Richie Rich.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.836
When I joined, this was
the only job I could get

13:22.836 --> 13:24.304
making 30 thou a year.

13:24.304 --> 13:27.440
It's better
than digging ditches.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.182
(sighs)

13:35.182 --> 13:37.317
I left my wallet
in my trailer, bro.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.757
Here you go.
Oh, be cool, man.
That's embarrassing.

13:44.757 --> 13:46.359
Give me a C-note.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.494
Come on.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.496
(whistles)

13:52.632 --> 13:55.335
(chuckling)

13:55.335 --> 13:56.970
(mumbling)

13:56.970 --> 13:59.106
Let's go.
Let's go, come on.

14:06.146 --> 14:07.680
Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.848
You're gonna drive.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.317
We're gonna
have a cigar.

14:10.317 --> 14:11.618
Dewey, are you kidding me?

14:11.618 --> 14:13.620
You can't smoke in there.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.255
Who cares?

14:15.255 --> 14:16.523
Lighten up
a little bit.

14:16.523 --> 14:17.925
Yeah, lighten up,
sweetheart, okay?

14:17.925 --> 14:19.159
Have some fun.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.094
Hey.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.432
What do you think about acting?

14:25.432 --> 14:27.434
You know like in the movies
like me.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.402
(Dewey laughs)
That works for you?

14:29.402 --> 14:31.972
Women actually
go for that?

14:31.972 --> 14:34.474
Women go for anything I do.

14:34.474 --> 14:35.608
(laughing)

14:35.608 --> 14:38.411
Women go for it.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.449
She's a drag.
Come on.

14:51.591 --> 14:56.196
DISPATCH:
All units, a 211 in progress
at 402 Genessee.

14:56.196 --> 14:58.231
Two male Caucasians
wearing dark clothing.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.633
Whoa!
Light 'em up!
Whoa!

15:04.804 --> 15:06.940
Hold on, darlin'.

15:08.675 --> 15:11.278
(grunts)

15:17.050 --> 15:19.586
(tires screeching)

15:21.021 --> 15:22.422
(tires screeching)
(thud)

15:22.422 --> 15:23.423
Go!

15:27.860 --> 15:30.230
(tires squealing)

15:40.974 --> 15:42.709
(men grunting)

15:46.279 --> 15:48.115
Officer needs assistance,

15:48.115 --> 15:50.183
two suspects heading northbound
on Genessee

15:50.183 --> 15:51.351
between the businesses.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.427
(grunts)

16:04.131 --> 16:05.365
MAN (distantly):
Run, run!

16:05.365 --> 16:06.833
MAN 2:
I'm telling you, baby!

16:06.833 --> 16:08.068
MAN:
He's gaining on you!

16:09.969 --> 16:11.104
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

16:11.104 --> 16:13.106
BEN:
Stop! Stop! Stop!

16:13.106 --> 16:14.574
Down!

16:14.574 --> 16:17.144
Face down, arms
at your side! Now!

16:18.545 --> 16:21.548
Down!

16:21.548 --> 16:25.485
Spread 'em!

16:25.485 --> 16:29.056
6 Adam 43,
show suspects in custody

16:29.056 --> 16:31.858
at the rear of 132 1/2 Genessee.

16:31.858 --> 16:33.560
DISPATCH:
Copy that.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.528
132 1/2?

16:36.629 --> 16:39.032
That's right.

16:41.368 --> 16:43.770
(sirens approaching)

16:49.909 --> 16:52.045
These the guys
that beat you?

16:58.985 --> 17:00.920
No, that's not them.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.289
LACEY:
Of course that's them.

17:02.289 --> 17:03.956
I saw them beating her!

17:03.956 --> 17:05.492
Ma'am, step inside,
please.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.294
(scoffs)

17:07.294 --> 17:09.429
Put 'em in the tank.

17:30.650 --> 17:33.453
Look...

17:33.453 --> 17:36.589
I know what's
going on here.

17:37.757 --> 17:41.094
These guys are hassling you
every week, right?

17:42.962 --> 17:46.966
You don't have to pay
these people.

17:46.966 --> 17:50.069
Is it just these two
or are there more?

17:53.406 --> 17:55.942
Could you get
my wig, please?

17:55.942 --> 17:58.077
It's...

18:17.130 --> 18:19.966
We're the police.

18:19.966 --> 18:22.269
We will protect you.

18:22.269 --> 18:24.371
Look, you seem like
a lovely gentleman,

18:24.371 --> 18:27.640
but who the hell do you think
you're kiddin'?

18:37.717 --> 18:40.920
Tell Dewey to take our suspect
back with him.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.922
I'm going to stay here,

18:42.922 --> 18:44.857
see if she'll
change her mind.

18:46.159 --> 18:48.161
Bentley and a Great Dane.

18:48.161 --> 18:50.663
BEN:
Want me to call it in?

18:53.766 --> 18:55.702
No.

18:57.204 --> 18:58.671
So, anyway, I got this blond.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.273
I got her bent over a sofa,
right.

19:00.273 --> 19:01.808
But I'm inebriated,
right.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.075
I'm intoxicated.

19:03.075 --> 19:04.944
And I-I pass out
on top of her

19:04.944 --> 19:05.978
and I'm smoking
a cigar.

19:05.978 --> 19:09.482
I burn a hole...

19:09.482 --> 19:11.150
So, look, we're gonna hand
you over our suspect.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.852
We gotta stay here and
deal with this.
Fine.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.687
Was Dewey just in the
back seat with him?

19:14.687 --> 19:15.722
Don't ask.

19:18.225 --> 19:20.227
Ma'am, we're gonna
transfer you over now.

19:20.227 --> 19:22.229
I had a Bentley once.

19:22.229 --> 19:24.364
For a week.

19:26.199 --> 19:28.034
Hey!

19:28.034 --> 19:29.502
Hey, come on!

19:29.502 --> 19:31.638
You can't park there!

19:34.707 --> 19:36.409
Okay, ma'am,
out of the car, please.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.077
I'd rather stay
with you.
(chuckles)

19:38.077 --> 19:40.012
Now, please.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.014
(Ben grunts)

19:42.014 --> 19:43.950
Thanks.

19:46.986 --> 19:48.988
Dewey, where is he?

19:48.988 --> 19:50.790
Who?
(scoffs)

19:50.790 --> 19:53.960
I don't know, he
must have escaped.

19:53.960 --> 19:57.964
You're such an asshole.

19:57.964 --> 19:59.966
(Dewey chuckles)

19:59.966 --> 20:01.901
CHICKIE:
Watch your head.

20:03.236 --> 20:05.238
Hey, I'm sorry.
Whoa! Whoa!

20:05.238 --> 20:07.374
Hey, man, I don't
want to lose that.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.812
You feel bad
about what you told her?

20:12.812 --> 20:15.948
What? What, "we're the police,
we'll protect you"?

20:15.948 --> 20:16.716
Yeah.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.318
No.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.653
You don't lie to 'em like that,
nobody ever gets put away.

20:20.653 --> 20:21.788
Yeah, but we can't
protect them.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.189
Those guys are just
gonna come back.

20:23.189 --> 20:26.293
Or two more
just like 'em.

20:26.293 --> 20:28.328
It is what it is.

20:28.328 --> 20:31.331
This domestic
we're going to?

20:31.331 --> 20:32.565
They're tricky.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.567
Gotta be on your guard.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.503
You get there and she's
screaming at you

20:36.503 --> 20:38.538
to lock up the asshole
that just beat her up,

20:38.538 --> 20:40.640
you go to put the cuffs on him,
next thing you know,

20:40.640 --> 20:42.709
she's jumping
on your back,

20:42.709 --> 20:45.044
trying to rake your eyes out
for locking up her beloved.

20:45.044 --> 20:46.212
Yeah, I got it.

20:46.212 --> 20:47.514
Oh, yeah?

20:47.514 --> 20:50.350
Mommy and Daddy
didn't get along?

20:50.350 --> 20:52.352
A little trouble
in Beverly Hills?

20:52.352 --> 20:54.387
What is your problem?
Well, you never said

20:54.387 --> 20:55.855
why you learned to shoot.

20:55.855 --> 20:58.257
You said where,
but you never said why.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.092
I wanted to learn.
Yeah.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.094
(chuckles)

21:02.094 --> 21:03.763
Nobody shoots like you

21:03.763 --> 21:05.532
didn't spend a lot
of time doing it.

21:05.532 --> 21:08.668
Just doesn't equate, Bijan.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.839
How'd you learn?

21:12.839 --> 21:15.575
My dad taught me.

21:15.575 --> 21:18.711
In between stints
in prison.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.688
MAN:
Why don't you try
Be a man sometimes!

21:28.688 --> 21:30.357
open your ears
Why don't you try
to be a man?

21:30.357 --> 21:31.491
and shut your mouth!
Get a job!

21:31.491 --> 21:33.493
(overlapping yelling)
Shit.

21:33.493 --> 21:34.961
WOMAN:
I should punch you
in your mouth!

21:34.961 --> 21:36.596
I should punch you
in your mouth!

21:36.596 --> 21:38.598
This asshole has been
hitting me again.

21:38.598 --> 21:39.999
I been screaming
all day.

21:39.999 --> 21:42.935
(overlapping yelling)

21:42.935 --> 21:44.971
Hey! Hey! Hey!

21:44.971 --> 21:46.138
Stop!

21:46.138 --> 21:47.206
Shut up right now!

21:47.206 --> 21:48.708
Shut up!

21:48.708 --> 21:49.976
Where are the kids?
They're in school.

21:49.976 --> 21:51.344
Where the hell you
think they are?

21:51.344 --> 21:52.244
You know what?

21:52.244 --> 21:53.145
...you.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.447
I'm sick of this.

21:54.447 --> 21:56.349
I'm not coming back
here anymore.

21:56.349 --> 21:57.884
Put your hands
on my badge.

21:57.884 --> 22:00.119
What? What for?
I'm giving you
a divorce.

22:00.119 --> 22:01.688
MAN:
Man, you trippin'.

22:01.688 --> 22:03.122
You can't do that.
Sure I can.

22:03.122 --> 22:06.025
Put your hand
on my badge.

22:10.497 --> 22:12.031
Right hand.

22:12.031 --> 22:13.500
Get-get-- Don't!
Off! Off!

22:13.500 --> 22:15.267
I said don't touch me.
Don't touch me!

22:15.267 --> 22:17.269
Put your goddamn
hands on...

22:17.269 --> 22:18.304
You watch...
Don't touch me!

22:18.304 --> 22:19.972
Get off me! Get off me!
Oh...

22:19.972 --> 22:21.708
You watching this?

22:21.708 --> 22:22.775
All right now.
Okay.

22:22.775 --> 22:24.444
Do you want
to do this?

22:24.444 --> 22:25.978
Do you want
to do this?

22:25.978 --> 22:28.047
Oh, please!

22:28.047 --> 22:30.483
Please!
Whatcha gonna do?

22:30.483 --> 22:31.718
You got a choice
right now.

22:31.718 --> 22:33.686
You put your hand
on my badge

22:33.686 --> 22:34.854
and we take
care of this.

22:36.022 --> 22:38.024
Now.

22:42.261 --> 22:45.164
Right hand.

22:45.164 --> 22:48.501
By the power vested in me
by the state of California,

22:48.501 --> 22:51.404
I now pronounce you divorced.

22:51.404 --> 22:54.407
Now, pack your bag
Mm-hmm.

22:54.407 --> 22:56.443
and get the fuck out of here.

22:56.443 --> 22:58.511
Go! You heard him! Get out!

22:58.511 --> 23:00.647
Yeah, why don't you get
off your ass sometimes?

23:00.647 --> 23:01.748
Oh, get out!
Get your ass

23:01.748 --> 23:03.650
off the couch
sometime, will you?

23:03.650 --> 23:04.817
(indistinct yelling)

23:04.817 --> 23:06.419
He ain't even
got no car!

23:06.419 --> 23:08.521
Walk! Walk!
Broke! Broke ass!

23:08.521 --> 23:09.889
I'll be back
for your ass!
Shut up!

23:09.889 --> 23:11.257
That's for damn sure!
Oh, please!

23:11.257 --> 23:12.792
You better believe that!
You heard him, right?

23:12.792 --> 23:13.860
You believe it,
all right?!

23:13.860 --> 23:15.294
You hear that?
Yeah.

23:15.294 --> 23:16.829
Yeah, I did.

23:27.940 --> 23:30.610
(laughing)

23:30.610 --> 23:32.879
Okay, no, I gotta call you back.

23:32.879 --> 23:34.714
Why the hell you
wearing a puss, huh?

23:34.714 --> 23:36.015
You had a good day.

23:36.015 --> 23:37.717
You made a bust, pulled
a gun off the street.

23:37.717 --> 23:39.852
Dewey, you let him go.

23:39.852 --> 23:41.353
That's gonna come
back to haunt us.

23:41.353 --> 23:42.722
We needed his statement.

23:42.722 --> 23:44.591
Why the hell you gotta
make such a big deal

23:44.591 --> 23:45.658
out of everything?

23:45.658 --> 23:47.727
You gotta be kidding me.

23:47.727 --> 23:49.395
I put my ass on
the line for you.

23:49.395 --> 23:51.931
I gave you another shot when
no one else would work with you.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.432
No one!

23:53.432 --> 23:56.235
And now I'm gonna get
in trouble for this?

23:56.235 --> 23:57.604
For that asshole?

23:57.604 --> 23:58.805
So you can impress him

23:58.805 --> 24:01.708
with what a big man you are?

24:01.708 --> 24:03.209
You know what, Dewey?

24:03.209 --> 24:05.645
I actually care about my job.

24:05.645 --> 24:07.780
If this is the way
you do police work,

24:07.780 --> 24:09.949
I want a new partner.

24:10.650 --> 24:13.853
You on the rag?

24:13.853 --> 24:15.555
Hmm?

24:15.555 --> 24:17.356
The shift is freaking over, man.

24:17.356 --> 24:18.958
Relax.

24:24.764 --> 24:28.434
She, uh, acted a little bit.

24:28.434 --> 24:31.704
Barry was a producer.

24:31.704 --> 24:34.173
Uh, she tried to write.

24:34.173 --> 24:35.274
I'm a writer.

24:35.274 --> 24:37.777
Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.

24:37.777 --> 24:39.679
What do you write?

24:39.679 --> 24:43.482
I just published
my second novel.

24:43.482 --> 24:46.919
That's, that's tremendous.

24:46.919 --> 24:49.421
Hmm.

24:49.421 --> 24:51.423
Don't tell me
you want to write?

24:51.423 --> 24:55.061
(chuckles)
Busted.

24:55.061 --> 25:00.633
I would, uh, I would think
that the things that you witness

25:00.633 --> 25:05.504
would be very interesting.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.607
And heartbreaking.

25:09.275 --> 25:10.777
Have you tried?

25:10.777 --> 25:13.780
Yeah, yeah, I have.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.447
Short stories.

25:15.447 --> 25:16.983
Very short.

25:16.983 --> 25:18.284
(both chuckling)

25:18.284 --> 25:19.518
I teach a class.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.353
You should come.

25:21.353 --> 25:22.989
I'm a really good teacher.

25:22.989 --> 25:24.490
Yeah.

25:24.490 --> 25:27.159
It would light a fire
under your ass.

25:27.159 --> 25:30.462
You actually produce for my
class or I throw your ass out.

25:30.462 --> 25:31.664
(Russell laughing)

25:31.664 --> 25:34.366
No excuses.

25:34.366 --> 25:37.704
Hey.

25:37.704 --> 25:40.306
Hey, um, we need to go
do that interview.

25:43.475 --> 25:45.511
This is Keren Campbell.

25:45.511 --> 25:46.679
I'm sorry for your loss.

25:46.679 --> 25:47.947
Thank you.

25:55.655 --> 25:57.423
So where do you live now?

25:57.423 --> 25:59.726
KEREN:
Uh, in Los Feliz.

25:59.726 --> 26:02.862
(rapid gunfire,
chatter and laughter)

26:08.668 --> 26:09.902
Sweet!

26:12.705 --> 26:14.707
You all right?
You all right?

26:14.707 --> 26:16.042
Of course I'm all right.

26:18.645 --> 26:21.247
Whoo-hoo! (laughing)

26:21.247 --> 26:23.182
Thanks, bro.

26:24.751 --> 26:27.687
Grab the tomatillo sauce.

26:27.687 --> 26:29.689
You know, if those
kids were there,

26:29.689 --> 26:31.323
I would've handled
that differently.

26:31.323 --> 26:36.796
The only way it ends
is if one of them leaves.

26:36.796 --> 26:38.197
But they never do.

26:38.197 --> 26:40.667
Either that or one of them
kills the other one.

26:40.667 --> 26:42.501
Round and round.

26:42.501 --> 26:43.670
It never ends.

26:43.670 --> 26:45.838
So fucking sick of it.

26:47.006 --> 26:48.975
Your Dad ever hit your Mom?

26:48.975 --> 26:50.743
Have to call the West
Latte police station,

26:50.743 --> 26:51.711
have them come on over?

26:51.711 --> 26:53.145
Man, what is it with you?

26:53.145 --> 26:55.114
Enough.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.816
Tomatillo sauce.

26:56.816 --> 26:58.384
Can I get some napkins?

26:58.384 --> 26:59.819
This thing's a class three!

26:59.819 --> 27:01.688
How the hell'd you
get a permit for this?

27:01.688 --> 27:02.855
I didn't.

27:02.855 --> 27:04.957
My props guy-- Hey, man!

27:04.957 --> 27:06.726
Props guy, he hooked me up,

27:06.726 --> 27:09.161
he converted it
from a semi to full auto.

27:09.161 --> 27:10.462
(Dewey laughing)

27:10.462 --> 27:12.665
Hey, baby, this is
my friend, uh, Dewey.

27:12.665 --> 27:15.802
Wow, yeah.
Is that a costume?

27:15.802 --> 27:17.804
Yeah, I'm one of
the Village People.

27:17.804 --> 27:18.938
(laughing):
You the Y, the W,

27:18.938 --> 27:20.539
the C or the A, huh?

27:20.539 --> 27:22.508
Hey, be cool, man.
Rambo!

27:22.508 --> 27:26.612
I know, hey, this mother
fires real live ammo, okay.

27:26.612 --> 27:27.814
Coyote!

27:31.718 --> 27:32.852
Dead coyote.

27:32.852 --> 27:35.822
(both laughing)

27:41.527 --> 27:42.962
You like that thing?

27:44.864 --> 27:47.233
Text all your
little buddies?

27:47.233 --> 27:48.935
I don't get it.

27:48.935 --> 27:53.906
I want less ways for people
to reach me, not more.

27:53.906 --> 27:55.942
The lone wolf.

27:55.942 --> 27:57.977
That's right, hombre.

27:57.977 --> 27:59.545
Got yourself a hot date?

27:59.545 --> 28:01.080
Yeah, it's my half sister.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.850
Ah, don't you Beverly Hills
folks date your sisters?

28:03.850 --> 28:07.519
There's nothing wrong
with that, right?

28:07.519 --> 28:09.388
(chuckling)

28:13.225 --> 28:14.126
Whoa.

28:14.126 --> 28:16.128
Pull it over.

28:33.312 --> 28:34.981
WOMAN:
It's all good,
it's all good.

28:38.450 --> 28:40.352
Hey, guys.

28:40.352 --> 28:41.988
How you doing tonight?

28:41.988 --> 28:43.122
License and registration,
please.

28:43.122 --> 28:45.958
I got it in here somewhere.

28:45.958 --> 28:47.326
How you doing?

28:47.326 --> 28:49.528
Oh, we're fine.

28:49.528 --> 28:51.998
Oh.

28:51.998 --> 28:53.800
This is registered
to Donte Johnson.

28:54.666 --> 28:55.634
I know.

28:55.634 --> 28:56.803
He gave it to me.

28:56.803 --> 28:58.871
(dog growling)
It's a present.

28:58.871 --> 29:01.173
What's the dog's name?

29:03.075 --> 29:05.311
I do not remember.

29:05.311 --> 29:06.378
Come on, ladies.

29:06.378 --> 29:08.848
You took the car,
you took the dog.

29:08.848 --> 29:09.882
No, no, no, no, no.

29:09.882 --> 29:11.918
It ain't even like that, no.

29:11.918 --> 29:14.153
Donte is a real close friend.

29:14.153 --> 29:16.088
I got a lot of close friends.

29:16.088 --> 29:18.157
You boys feel like a party?

29:18.157 --> 29:19.225
No.

29:19.225 --> 29:20.392
You sure?

29:20.392 --> 29:21.994
He's sure.

29:21.994 --> 29:24.864
Well, you can pet him,
he's real nice and friendly.

29:24.864 --> 29:27.499
(dog barking)

29:28.600 --> 29:30.369
I just died!

29:30.369 --> 29:31.804
I'm on this
domestic call, right?

29:31.804 --> 29:33.039
Husband and wife.

29:33.039 --> 29:34.273
The chick's been beat down, man,

29:34.273 --> 29:36.708
two black eyes, she's crying.

29:36.708 --> 29:38.444
I'm feeling bad,
what the hell do you say

29:38.444 --> 29:40.079
to a woman whose
got two black eyes?

29:40.079 --> 29:42.014
What?
Nothing!

29:42.014 --> 29:43.549
You done told that bitch twice!

29:43.549 --> 29:44.616
(laughing)

29:44.616 --> 29:45.818
What's the matter, man?

29:45.818 --> 29:46.752
A bunch of girls
here, man, be cool.

29:46.752 --> 29:47.887
You don't like that one?

29:47.887 --> 29:48.988
That was not good.
I'm an actor.

29:48.988 --> 29:50.022
Hey, hey!
Know your audience.

29:50.022 --> 29:51.523
You know what, I need some...

29:51.523 --> 29:53.159
I need some new material,
could you help me with that?

29:53.159 --> 29:54.493
You do need some new material,
you can't have her.

29:54.493 --> 29:58.965
(laughing)

29:58.965 --> 30:02.168
You know, I always knew,
one way or another,

30:02.168 --> 30:07.173
that this guy
would do her in.

30:07.173 --> 30:09.475
You know, I'd send
her to Hazeldon,

30:09.475 --> 30:12.611
she would stay straight
for a few months

30:12.611 --> 30:14.080
and then Barry would call

30:14.080 --> 30:16.782
and he would say that
he'd straightened out,

30:16.782 --> 30:19.585
that they needed each other.

30:19.585 --> 30:21.854
And she would
go back to him.

30:21.854 --> 30:23.990
Every time.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.259
Why do women do that?

30:27.259 --> 30:29.862
Why do they go back
to the men that hurt them?

30:32.598 --> 30:34.433
I don't know.

30:36.702 --> 30:39.038
It's a terrible disease.

30:41.240 --> 30:43.075
No.

30:43.075 --> 30:45.912
You know what? Screw that.

30:45.912 --> 30:49.181
Lou Gehrig had a disease.

30:49.181 --> 30:51.283
Muhammed Ali has a disease.

30:51.283 --> 30:55.121
Michael J. Fox has a disease.

30:59.691 --> 31:02.161
Franklin D. Roosevelt?

31:08.534 --> 31:12.138
(laughing)

31:14.006 --> 31:17.643
(both laughing)

31:25.251 --> 31:27.186
(crying)

31:30.689 --> 31:32.925
(sobbing)

31:52.478 --> 31:55.614
(Keren sobbing)

32:06.792 --> 32:08.961
God...

32:08.961 --> 32:11.063
(sighing)

32:16.835 --> 32:19.571
You're hilarious.

32:19.571 --> 32:20.906
Are you married?

32:20.906 --> 32:22.975
Yeah.
Hmm.

32:22.975 --> 32:24.776
I am.
Too bad.

32:24.776 --> 32:27.379
(laughs)

32:38.390 --> 32:39.725
Want to go surf tomorrow?

32:39.725 --> 32:40.559
Where?

32:40.559 --> 32:41.827
I don't know.

32:41.827 --> 32:45.031
We could make a day of
it and drive up the coast.

32:45.031 --> 32:47.499
Stop at the Fish
Shack on the way back.

32:47.499 --> 32:48.667
Cool.

32:48.667 --> 32:49.968
Can Adam come?

32:49.968 --> 32:51.337
Which one's Adam?

32:51.337 --> 32:52.904
I met him in sixth grade.

32:52.904 --> 32:54.073
He's Samoan.

32:54.073 --> 32:55.574
Sure.

32:55.574 --> 32:56.675
(beeping)

33:04.016 --> 33:05.684
What is it?

33:05.684 --> 33:08.620
DEWEY:
Hey. Hey, I need you
to come get me right now.

33:08.620 --> 33:10.122
Where are you?

33:10.122 --> 33:12.124
I don't know.
I'm in Hollywood somewhere.

33:12.124 --> 33:13.492
I'm at Davis's place.

33:13.492 --> 33:14.460
No way.

33:14.460 --> 33:16.528
I'm fucked up right now, okay?

33:16.528 --> 33:18.330
I need you.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.032
Why don't you call your wife,
Dewey?

33:20.032 --> 33:21.367
Get her to come.

33:21.367 --> 33:23.902
Wait. wait.
Listen to me. Listen to me.

33:23.902 --> 33:26.072
I-I got a disorder, all right?

33:26.072 --> 33:27.906
I know I'm an ass, but...

33:27.906 --> 33:29.175
(Dewey panting)

33:29.175 --> 33:30.409
I'm an alcoholic, okay?

33:30.409 --> 33:31.877
I'm working on the ninth step.

33:31.877 --> 33:33.779
I need to make amends with you.

33:33.779 --> 33:34.980
Tonight?!

33:34.980 --> 33:37.015
Now! Right now!

33:37.015 --> 33:39.151
(grunts)

33:42.721 --> 33:43.955
Yeah?

33:43.955 --> 33:45.057
DONTE:
I don't care about

33:45.057 --> 33:46.692
the car, Mannix.

33:46.692 --> 33:48.194
I just want the damn dog.

33:48.194 --> 33:49.995
So, you still won't
press charges?

33:49.995 --> 33:51.297
No, dawg.

33:51.297 --> 33:54.032
Just bring the car, the animal,

33:54.032 --> 33:56.702
whatever, back over to me here,

33:56.702 --> 33:59.338
I'll take care of y'all.

33:59.338 --> 34:01.340
I look like Anthony Pellicano?

34:01.340 --> 34:03.509
Good luck in the playoffs, dawg.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.912
Let's go.

34:06.912 --> 34:08.714
Ladies, you have a good night.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.682
Thank you.

34:10.682 --> 34:12.618
(phone ringing)

34:13.885 --> 34:16.088
What?

34:17.823 --> 34:20.058
What's the address?

34:23.362 --> 34:25.131
We got to make
a little stop.

34:25.131 --> 34:27.266
(clears throat)

34:29.901 --> 34:32.070
(loud buzz of conversation)

34:32.070 --> 34:34.573
(dance music begins)

34:36.074 --> 34:38.277
Hot fuzz!

35:06.472 --> 35:08.106
DEWEY:
Officer down!

35:09.875 --> 35:12.644
I'm in the freakin' bedroom!

35:19.918 --> 35:21.253
Come on!
I'm in the bedroom!

35:21.253 --> 35:23.722
Come and get me!

35:24.556 --> 35:27.025
Come on, man!
This is a...

35:27.025 --> 35:29.361
(all laughing)

35:29.361 --> 35:30.729
Is he wearing
underwear?

35:30.729 --> 35:31.730
I don't know.

35:31.730 --> 35:32.864
It's funny, right?

35:32.864 --> 35:34.833
Come on. Just give me the key.
Unlock me.

35:34.833 --> 35:36.768
(Dewey panting)

35:36.768 --> 35:38.904
Coop, unlock me, okay?
Oh, hang on
there a second.

35:38.904 --> 35:40.306
No, no, don't do that.

35:40.306 --> 35:41.440
That's not right.
That's not right.

35:41.440 --> 35:42.608
That's not cool. That's...

35:42.608 --> 35:43.775
Don't do that. Don't do that.

35:43.775 --> 35:45.344
Rogue's gallery.
Okay?

35:45.344 --> 35:47.779
Some people say it doesn't
exist, and you know...

35:47.779 --> 35:48.980
Just unlock it.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.749
We document
the colossal fuck up,

35:50.749 --> 35:53.585
the indescribably grotesque,
the profane...

35:53.585 --> 35:54.586
Come on!

35:54.586 --> 35:57.055
the ridiculous,
the sacred.

35:57.055 --> 35:59.691
Unlock me, man! Now!

35:59.691 --> 36:02.060
(John laughing)

36:02.060 --> 36:04.630
Hey, whoa, whoa. Hold
on, hold on, hold on.

36:04.630 --> 36:05.797
Better get
this. Here.

36:05.797 --> 36:06.765
Ow! Ow! Shit.

36:06.765 --> 36:08.900
I don't want you
to lose that.

36:08.900 --> 36:09.668
Oh shit.
All right.

36:09.668 --> 36:11.036
Give me the key.

36:11.036 --> 36:14.072
No. You got yourself into
this, you get yourself out.

36:14.072 --> 36:15.941
Wait. What do you mean?
You're gonna just leave me here?

36:15.941 --> 36:17.042
Where's your gun?

36:17.042 --> 36:19.211
My pants are right here. Ow!

36:19.211 --> 36:20.412
Ow. Ow.

36:20.412 --> 36:22.581
Where's the
gun, dude?

36:22.581 --> 36:24.516
(sighs)

36:26.552 --> 36:28.354
Some chick took it.

36:29.855 --> 36:31.557
Pray she's still here.

36:31.557 --> 36:32.958
(sighs)

36:32.958 --> 36:34.460
I swear
to God, Cooper,

36:34.460 --> 36:36.295
I'm gonna
kill you.

36:36.295 --> 36:37.696
(panting)

36:37.696 --> 36:40.532
I'm gonna freakin'
kill you, Coop...

36:40.532 --> 36:42.501
(crying)

36:57.048 --> 36:58.850
Stop moving.

36:58.850 --> 36:59.951
Stop... moving.

37:04.790 --> 37:06.992
You got a pass today.

37:06.992 --> 37:08.860
Next time,

37:08.860 --> 37:11.563
I call your parole officer,
and you're going in.

37:17.002 --> 37:18.937
Come on, dance.

37:18.937 --> 37:21.106
Dance. Forget about him.

37:21.106 --> 37:23.241
Forget about him.

37:30.349 --> 37:32.117
It's an old injury.
Yeah?

37:32.117 --> 37:33.419
No big deal.

37:33.419 --> 37:34.853
You ever try
acupuncture?

37:34.853 --> 37:36.121
(laughs)

37:36.121 --> 37:38.324
I've tried everything.

37:56.408 --> 37:58.410
You guys okay?

37:58.410 --> 38:00.412
We're used
to this.

38:00.412 --> 38:02.581
Our Aunt's
coming to
pick us up.

38:02.581 --> 38:04.316
You got
your stuff?

38:04.316 --> 38:07.453
Yeah.

38:07.453 --> 38:10.422
MAN:
Shut up! Let me
get my stuff!

38:10.422 --> 38:13.091
so I can get
out of here.
(woman shouting)

38:13.091 --> 38:14.360
Oh, your boys
are back.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.362
(scoffs)

38:16.362 --> 38:17.696
Mutual combat.

38:17.696 --> 38:18.830
I told him not
to come back.

38:18.830 --> 38:20.131
I came back to
get my stuff.

38:20.131 --> 38:21.733
She stood in
front of the door.

38:21.733 --> 38:23.168
Call up for transport.
They're both going in.
What?!

38:23.168 --> 38:24.470
Get up!
(overlapping shouting)

38:24.470 --> 38:25.904
Six Adam 43. Request transpo,
our location.

38:25.904 --> 38:27.439
Turn around,
ma'am.
(overlapping shouting)

38:27.439 --> 38:28.740
Hands behind your back.
Hands behind your back.

38:28.740 --> 38:30.676
Palms together.
Palms together.

38:30.676 --> 38:31.810
What, you happy now?
Yes!

38:31.810 --> 38:33.479
Yes. Yes.
I'll bet you are.

38:33.479 --> 38:35.113
Next time, you're going
out on a stretcher.

38:35.113 --> 38:37.282
By whom?
Mm-hmm. Uh, see if you
can walk out next time.

38:37.282 --> 38:38.750
This in unbelievable. I'm the
victim here. Look at my face.

38:38.750 --> 38:39.885
You have the right
to remain silent.

38:39.885 --> 38:41.620
You have the right
to remain silent.

38:41.620 --> 38:43.088
BOTH:
Anything you say can be used
against you in court.

38:43.088 --> 38:44.590
Oh!

38:44.590 --> 38:46.392
BOTH:
You have the right
to the presence of an attorney

38:46.392 --> 38:48.627
before and during
any questioning.

38:48.627 --> 38:51.262
You still didn't
answer my question.

38:51.262 --> 38:52.798
Yeah? Which one?

38:52.798 --> 38:56.101
You got a look on your face
at the domestic.

38:56.101 --> 38:58.336
Leads me to think...

38:58.336 --> 39:01.373
Daddy beat up Mommy.

39:02.441 --> 39:04.476
It was worse
than that.

39:04.476 --> 39:06.478
Hmm. Nothing's worse
than that.

39:06.478 --> 39:07.979
Believe me, I know.

39:07.979 --> 39:09.014
Oh, yeah?

39:09.014 --> 39:10.215
Oh, yeah.

39:10.215 --> 39:14.553
My old man is the biggest
asshole who ever lived.

39:14.553 --> 39:16.588
What'd yours do?

39:16.588 --> 39:18.123
I already told you.

39:18.123 --> 39:19.391
(laughs)

39:19.391 --> 39:20.592
All right,
all right.

39:20.592 --> 39:22.761
No. Do you
want to know?

39:24.396 --> 39:25.564
All right,
I was ten.

39:25.564 --> 39:27.332
My mom-- she's a little, uh...

39:27.332 --> 39:28.967
She's a little fragile.

39:28.967 --> 39:31.036
My dad walks out on her.

39:31.036 --> 39:32.771
And these drug dealers
he represented--

39:32.771 --> 39:34.640
they broke
into the house.

39:34.640 --> 39:36.341
They beat the hell
out of her.

39:36.341 --> 39:39.077
I mean, just...

39:39.077 --> 39:41.480
I went to defend her,

39:41.480 --> 39:44.015
and they knocked out my teeth.

39:44.015 --> 39:46.852
And after that, I...

39:48.754 --> 39:51.590
I had some trouble sleeping,
so...

39:51.590 --> 39:53.224
So I learned to shoot.

39:53.224 --> 39:55.661
All right? End of story.

39:56.595 --> 39:58.730
Now will you get off my back?

40:02.634 --> 40:05.771
My old man's a
bigger asshole than that.

40:07.973 --> 40:10.208
Is he dead?

40:10.208 --> 40:12.210
No.

40:12.210 --> 40:14.212
(laughs)

40:14.212 --> 40:16.147
No, he's, uh...

40:18.316 --> 40:20.318
He's around.

40:20.318 --> 40:21.787
In prison.

40:25.824 --> 40:28.527
He raped and murdered someone.

40:35.567 --> 40:37.736
You have a good night.

40:47.245 --> 40:48.647
Thank you.

40:48.647 --> 40:50.682
WOMAN:
Look, um, I don't know
how much longer

40:50.682 --> 40:52.751
I can keep doing this,
'cause I'm really afraid

40:52.751 --> 40:54.385
one of the doctors
is gonna notice.

40:54.385 --> 40:56.522
How much of that stuff
are you taking?

40:56.522 --> 40:58.524
(laughs)

40:58.524 --> 41:00.892
You worried about me?

41:00.892 --> 41:04.696
Yeah, John, I'm
worried about you.

41:04.696 --> 41:07.232
You're working non-stop,
I know you're in pain...

41:07.232 --> 41:09.768
I'm fine. I'm fine.

41:09.768 --> 41:12.137
This is worse
than when we were married.

41:28.386 --> 41:30.689
Can I help you?

41:30.689 --> 41:33.725
Yeah, uh, Sherman party, please?

41:34.760 --> 41:36.895
Right this way, sir.

41:51.109 --> 41:52.477
Ben!

41:52.477 --> 41:53.979
Dude.

41:53.979 --> 41:57.315
Dad heard you were coming,
so he wanted to come say hello.

41:57.315 --> 41:59.985
Ben. Hello.
