You know, where Ollie's life is going...

36:46.955 --> 36:49.537
...there's not room for me in it.

36:50.166 --> 36:54.455
And I know he'd never admit that...

36:56.590 --> 36:58.330
...so I had to.

37:01.595 --> 37:03.301
ljust, um....

37:04.556 --> 37:07.798
I can't face another heartbreak
down the road.

37:26.995 --> 37:32.991
Besides, you know, why settle for hot, rich
and famous when I can hang out with you?

37:53.480 --> 37:56.062
I guess you got Blondie's message too.

37:58.109 --> 38:00.942
I spoke to Lois.
I'm sorry about what happened.

38:01.780 --> 38:05.364
Maybe she'll get used
to the whole dual identity thing someday.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.695
Yeah, like when?

38:07.869 --> 38:11.612
When the Earth cracks open
and time ticks backwards? I don't think so.

38:14.417 --> 38:17.534
Hey. Thanks for coming.

38:17.921 --> 38:20.537
I guess I need to eat a little crow, huh?

38:21.883 --> 38:23.669
Is it too late to ask for an apology?

38:24.052 --> 38:25.508
Apology accepted.

38:25.679 --> 38:27.840
Assuming you stop moonlighting for Lex.

38:28.014 --> 38:30.972
That won't be a problem.
I've decided to hang up my ﬁshnets.

38:32.310 --> 38:35.894
I think I was out of my league.
I'll just stick to being the word ofjustice.

38:36.064 --> 38:38.555
At least I can't hurt anyone
over the airwaves.

38:38.733 --> 38:40.564
Well, as long as they're not subsonic.

38:41.027 --> 38:42.563
Still, I gotta say, um...

38:43.405 --> 38:44.815
...kind of seems like a waste.

CLARK: Besides, Oliver and his boys
could always use a den mother.

38:47.909 --> 38:49.274
It's true.

38:49.452 --> 38:51.738
I'm not really much of a team player.

38:51.913 --> 38:54.245
Really? That's perfect.
You're gonna ﬁt right in.

38:58.628 --> 39:00.164
What about you?

39:00.338 --> 39:04.331
I'd say ricocheting bullets off your back
earns you the secret handshake.

39:04.926 --> 39:06.427
Maybe someday.

OLIVER:
Come on.

39:08.930 --> 39:11.216
There's a couple of people
I want you to meet.

39:13.810 --> 39:17.428
So no one ever told you
you have lousy taste in women?

Yeah.

Hi.

Hi.

39:50.930 --> 39:52.511
I talked to Chloe.

39:52.682 --> 39:55.799
Thought I should go stay with her
for a few days.

40:06.488 --> 40:07.978
I stole a Lamborghini.

40:10.700 --> 40:13.658
I broke into a bank of ATM machines
and I stole all the money.

And I know that it's hard to live with me,

Clark, I've been a two-headed hydra
lately myself.

40:44.692 --> 40:48.856
It's funny, you can have all the right
motives and still do all the wrong things.

40:54.869 --> 40:56.245
But...

40:57.413 --> 41:01.622
...for what it's worth,
I am still committed to us.

You don't think I am.

41:07.799 --> 41:10.165
...I think that you doubt
whether I'm the one...

Honestly, I don't know
what's gonna happen to us.

41:28.486 --> 41:30.147
I promise I'm gonna do everything...

41:30.321 --> 41:33.063
...to make sure
that we can trust each other again.
