06:28.009 --> 06:29.189
- Let's do it.

06:28.009 --> 06:29.189
- Should we get a cool glass?

06:29.199 --> 06:31.170
- Okay.

06:29.199 --> 06:31.170
Yes, I...

06:31.180 --> 06:33.189
- We might as well, right?

06:31.180 --> 06:33.189
- Right.

06:38.250 --> 06:40.149
- Hi.

06:38.250 --> 06:40.149
- It's Dorit.

06:40.159 --> 06:41.240
- Hi, guys!

06:42.240 --> 06:44.139
- Hi, Kathy.

06:42.240 --> 06:44.139
- Hello!

06:44.149 --> 06:45.110
- I'm so happy!

06:44.149 --> 06:45.110
- How are you?

06:45.120 --> 06:46.269
- Good to see you again.

06:45.120 --> 06:46.269
- How are you?

06:46.279 --> 06:49.009
- Good.

06:46.279 --> 06:49.009
- It's like I just saw you...

06:49.019 --> 06:50.209
- English and Scottish.

06:50.220 --> 06:52.009
- I asked for

06:50.220 --> 06:52.009
patriotic attire,

06:52.019 --> 06:53.279
but I think Dorit

06:52.019 --> 06:53.279
missed the memo.

06:53.290 --> 06:56.159
This is her

06:53.290 --> 06:56.159
preppy leprechaun look.

06:56.170 --> 06:58.110
- Oh, that looks beautiful!

06:56.170 --> 06:58.110
- Don't eat the flags.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.259
That's what he said.

06:59.269 --> 07:03.129
- No, no flags. Let's, no...

06:59.269 --> 07:03.129
- Hey! Hello!

07:03.139 --> 07:06.019
How are you?

07:03.139 --> 07:06.019
- Hi!

07:06.029 --> 07:07.069
- You're what? What'd you say?

07:06.029 --> 07:07.069
You're what?

07:07.079 --> 07:08.069
- I'm good!

07:08.079 --> 07:09.089
- Oh, I thought you said

07:08.079 --> 07:09.089
something else.

07:09.100 --> 07:10.250
- No, no, no, I'm good.

07:09.100 --> 07:10.250
- Hi, Kyle. How are you?

07:10.259 --> 07:12.000
She pushed me to the side!

07:12.009 --> 07:13.120
- Oh, my God! Hey.

07:12.009 --> 07:13.120
- Hi!

07:13.129 --> 07:14.290
- Hi, guys. Nice to see you.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.120
- How are you?

07:15.000 --> 07:16.120
- I'm well.

07:16.129 --> 07:18.160
- Crystal and I

07:16.129 --> 07:18.160
are being very polite.

07:18.170 --> 07:21.290
I mean walking on very thin,

07:18.170 --> 07:21.290
crystal ice with her.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.079
- Hi!

07:22.000 --> 07:23.079
- I'm Sutton Stracke.

07:23.089 --> 07:24.209
- What's up?

07:23.089 --> 07:24.209
- Nice to meet you.

07:24.220 --> 07:26.029
- Nice to meet you too.

07:24.220 --> 07:26.029
- What's your name?

07:26.040 --> 07:27.160
- Rob.

07:26.040 --> 07:27.160
- Rob. Nice to meet you.

07:27.170 --> 07:28.279
- How are you?

07:27.170 --> 07:28.279
- I'm good. How are you?

07:28.290 --> 07:30.189
- I'm good.

07:28.290 --> 07:30.189
- Yeah, good. Election night.

07:30.199 --> 07:32.019
This is what

07:30.199 --> 07:32.019
we've been waiting for.

07:32.029 --> 07:34.079
- Right.

07:32.029 --> 07:34.079
- Hello!

07:34.090 --> 07:35.189
all: Oh!

07:34.090 --> 07:35.189
- Hello, everybody.

07:35.199 --> 07:36.250
It's election night!

07:36.259 --> 07:38.240
- The party's here!

07:36.259 --> 07:38.240
- Oh, my God.

07:38.250 --> 07:41.079
[overlapping chatter]

07:41.090 --> 07:42.220
[all cheering]

07:42.230 --> 07:44.040
- Woo!

07:42.230 --> 07:44.040
- Rinna, is that Sabrina?

07:44.050 --> 07:45.159
- It's Barbie. Harry named her.

07:45.170 --> 07:46.220
- Oh!

07:45.170 --> 07:46.220
- Oh, my God.

07:46.230 --> 07:48.079
- Harry named her Barbie

07:46.230 --> 07:48.079
tonight,

07:48.090 --> 07:49.269
so you kind of have

07:48.090 --> 07:49.269
to go with it.

07:49.279 --> 07:52.199
Harry and I have spent

07:49.279 --> 07:52.199
a lot of time together.

07:52.209 --> 07:54.240
I think a new persona

07:52.209 --> 07:54.240
doesn't hurt.

07:54.250 --> 07:56.290
You know, it spices

07:54.250 --> 07:56.290
things up a little bit.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.129
- Grab your drinks.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.129
Let's go outside for a minute.

07:59.139 --> 08:00.189
Let's go outside.

08:00.199 --> 08:01.279
- I have to peek in

08:00.199 --> 08:01.279
from time to time.

08:01.290 --> 08:03.040
- No, I have a TV outside.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.149
- Oh, you have a TV outside?

08:03.050 --> 08:04.149
- Yeah.

08:04.160 --> 08:05.259
- Okay. Where's the TV?

08:05.269 --> 08:07.149
- Oh, it's in there.

08:05.269 --> 08:07.149
- It's over there, yeah.

08:07.160 --> 08:09.290
- Isn't this cool?

08:07.160 --> 08:09.290
- Yeah. This is great.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.160
- Everyone sit down.

08:11.170 --> 08:13.089
- Oh, look at this

08:11.170 --> 08:13.089
presentation!

08:13.100 --> 08:15.100
- You guys, who do we think is

08:13.100 --> 08:15.100
going to win tonight?

08:15.110 --> 08:16.279
- Remember 4 years ago...

08:16.290 --> 08:18.259
- No, I don't think we're going

08:16.290 --> 08:18.259
to know until Thursday.

08:18.269 --> 08:20.230
- I don't think we're going

08:18.269 --> 08:20.230
to know for another month.

08:20.240 --> 08:22.040
- Any other talk to Erika

08:20.240 --> 08:22.040
today?

08:22.050 --> 08:24.139
- I did.

08:24.149 --> 08:26.149
- Did you already know

08:24.149 --> 08:26.149
what was going on?

08:26.160 --> 08:31.050
- I didn't know until she sent

08:26.160 --> 08:31.050
that text to us today at 9:15,

08:31.060 --> 08:32.259
and I instantly called her.

08:32.269 --> 08:37.009
And you know, I was just as

08:32.269 --> 08:37.009
surprised as we all were.

08:37.019 --> 08:39.009
Erika had us over a year ago.

08:39.019 --> 08:43.100
Tom was in great spirits.

08:39.019 --> 08:43.100
He was beyond charming.

08:43.110 --> 08:45.269
- In a movie in high school.

08:43.110 --> 08:45.269
- It was a western.

08:45.279 --> 08:49.159
- So I got shot off the roof

08:45.279 --> 08:49.159
and fell down.

08:49.169 --> 08:50.230
- Did you have a stunt double?

08:50.240 --> 08:53.269
- No, it was all me.

08:50.240 --> 08:53.269
[laughter]

08:53.279 --> 08:58.019
- Erika was enjoying watching

08:53.279 --> 08:58.019
Tom be charming with us.

08:58.029 --> 08:59.169
There was just no sign

08:59.179 --> 09:02.019
of anything

08:59.179 --> 09:02.019
that would lead to a divorce.

09:02.029 --> 09:04.000
- It was a surprise.

09:02.029 --> 09:04.000
- Mm-hmm.

09:04.009 --> 09:06.250
- You know, we don't know

09:04.009 --> 09:06.250
enough about what's happening.

09:06.259 --> 09:08.279
- We don't know what goes on

09:06.259 --> 09:08.279
behind closed doors.

09:08.289 --> 09:11.169
- You don't!

09:08.289 --> 09:11.169
- You never, never know.

09:11.179 --> 09:13.279
- I know that if I was

09:11.179 --> 09:13.279
going through a divorce,

09:13.289 --> 09:15.220
I would have shared it

09:13.289 --> 09:15.220
with these women.

09:15.230 --> 09:18.220
I'm not judging,

09:15.230 --> 09:18.220
I'm just thinking,

09:18.230 --> 09:20.179
"Gosh, I thought we were

09:18.230 --> 09:20.179
closer than that."

09:20.190 --> 09:22.250
Now, not to make

09:20.190 --> 09:22.250
things awkward,

09:22.259 --> 09:24.179
but I know that you guys

09:22.259 --> 09:24.179
have not seen each other

09:24.190 --> 09:25.279
since Lake Tahoe

09:24.190 --> 09:25.279
and on the plane.

09:25.289 --> 09:27.009
- Right. Right.

09:27.019 --> 09:30.009
- And you guys had your thing.

09:27.019 --> 09:30.009
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:30.019 --> 09:31.279
No, I mean, I know

09:30.019 --> 09:31.279
that I had my little breakdown,

09:31.289 --> 09:35.120
and I have apologized,

09:31.289 --> 09:35.120
and I felt good when we left,

09:35.129 --> 09:40.000
so I don't know if

09:35.129 --> 09:40.000
there's anything left to say.

09:40.009 --> 09:41.289
- You know, it was good.

09:40.009 --> 09:41.289
I think it was fine.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.120
- What was the report

09:42.000 --> 09:44.120
from Crystal

09:44.129 --> 09:45.289
from her first trip

09:44.129 --> 09:45.289
with the ladies?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.259
- You know what, she had

09:47.269 --> 09:50.220
a great time with

09:47.269 --> 09:50.220
almost everybody.

09:50.230 --> 09:52.250
- Yeah. Almost everybody.

09:50.230 --> 09:52.250
- Almost everybody.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.070
- So who is the

09:52.259 --> 09:54.070
almost not, Sutton?

09:54.080 --> 09:55.200
- Yeah.

09:55.210 --> 09:56.200
- From the way I heard

09:55.210 --> 09:56.200
the story,

09:56.210 --> 09:57.250
it was just, you know,

09:56.210 --> 09:57.250
it was a girl's trip,

09:57.259 --> 10:00.240
and just, you know, she walked

09:57.259 --> 10:00.240
in to return a sweater.

10:00.250 --> 10:02.169
- First of all, I would never

10:00.250 --> 10:02.169
walk in to someone's room

10:02.179 --> 10:04.250
without knocking, and secondly,

10:02.179 --> 10:04.250
if I saw that they were...

10:04.259 --> 10:05.259
- Dude, if you and I

10:04.259 --> 10:05.259
were on a guy's trip,

10:05.269 --> 10:07.200
you'd walk in my room

10:05.269 --> 10:07.200
in a ----ing nanosecond.

10:07.210 --> 10:08.289
- Yeah, but this isn't

10:07.210 --> 10:08.289
a guy's trip.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.009
- What are you

10:09.000 --> 10:10.009
even talking about?

10:10.019 --> 10:11.129
You don't even have to...

10:11.139 --> 10:12.289
- It's not a ----ing

10:11.139 --> 10:12.289
guy's trip, Moe.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.240
- Let's be real.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.240
I don't think I'd invite you

10:14.250 --> 10:16.190
on a guy's trip to be...

10:14.250 --> 10:16.190
- Good, so we're good.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.149
- [laughs]

10:17.159 --> 10:19.269
- I'm not coming,

10:17.159 --> 10:19.269
you're not inviting.

10:19.279 --> 10:22.220
All he does is smoke the doobie

10:19.279 --> 10:22.220
and talk sh--,

10:22.230 --> 10:23.259
so I'm not sure I'd bother.

10:23.269 --> 10:27.129
- I got home that afternoon,

10:23.269 --> 10:27.129
and I got on the scale.

10:27.139 --> 10:28.289
And I lost five pounds.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.240
- Well, thank you!

10:29.000 --> 10:30.240
- How fabulous!

10:30.250 --> 10:33.080
- Say, "Thank you, Sutton!"

10:30.250 --> 10:33.080
- Hallelujah!

10:33.090 --> 10:34.200
- Wow!

10:34.210 --> 10:37.129
- Wait, say...

10:34.210 --> 10:37.129
- A new weight-loss program.

10:37.139 --> 10:38.129
- You guys, wait.

10:38.139 --> 10:40.240
It wasn't like a great feeling

10:38.139 --> 10:40.240
because, like,

10:40.250 --> 10:42.039
I have food issues,

10:40.250 --> 10:42.039
like, whatever.

10:42.049 --> 10:43.159
- I am sorry.

10:42.049 --> 10:43.159
I am not going to--

10:44.230 --> 10:46.090
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

10:46.100 --> 10:47.250
I am not responsible for

10:46.100 --> 10:47.250
anybody losing five pounds. No.

10:47.259 --> 10:49.029
- Like, I'm anger hungry.

10:47.259 --> 10:49.029
- Wait, hold on.

10:49.039 --> 10:50.190
I want to hear this.

10:50.200 --> 10:52.009
- No, I'm a recovering bulimic,

10:50.200 --> 10:52.009
so, like...

10:52.019 --> 10:55.000
and I say recovering

10:52.019 --> 10:55.000
because, like, it's...

10:55.009 --> 10:56.090
I don't know what it's like

10:55.009 --> 10:56.090
to be any other thing.

10:56.100 --> 10:57.269
- I didn't know that.

10:56.100 --> 10:57.269
- I know you don't.

10:57.279 --> 11:02.100
♪ ♪

11:02.110 --> 11:03.139
- Coming up...

11:03.149 --> 11:06.019
- Do you want to invest

11:03.149 --> 11:06.019
in our friendship like this?

11:06.029 --> 11:07.019
- I think I have.

11:07.029 --> 11:09.169
- Then don't ever talk to me

11:07.029 --> 11:09.169
like that again.

11:14.080 --> 11:14.289
- I got home,

11:14.169 --> 11:14.289
and I got on the scale.

11:16.100 --> 11:17.269
And I lost five pounds.

11:17.279 --> 11:19.230
- Well, thank you!

11:17.279 --> 11:19.230
- How fabulous!

11:19.240 --> 11:22.059
- Wait, say "Thank you, Sutton."

11:19.240 --> 11:22.059
- Hallelujah!

11:22.070 --> 11:23.230
- Wait, hold on.

11:22.070 --> 11:23.230
I want to hear this.

11:23.240 --> 11:25.070
- No, I'm a recovering bulimic,

11:23.240 --> 11:25.070
so, like...

11:25.080 --> 11:26.200
- Oh!

11:25.080 --> 11:26.200
- And I say recovering because,

11:26.210 --> 11:28.039
like, it's...

11:28.049 --> 11:29.250
I don't know what it's like

11:28.049 --> 11:29.250
to be any other thing.

11:29.259 --> 11:31.080
- I didn't know that.

11:29.259 --> 11:31.080
- I know you don't.

11:31.090 --> 11:32.159
- But that's really nice

11:31.090 --> 11:32.159
for you to share that.

11:32.169 --> 11:33.240
- Brave of you to share that.

11:33.250 --> 11:35.029
- That's so important

11:33.250 --> 11:35.029
to share that.

11:35.039 --> 11:36.259
- It was not, like,

11:35.039 --> 11:36.259
a good weight loss.

11:36.269 --> 11:38.139
I was like, "Okay,

11:36.269 --> 11:38.139
this is sort of indicative

11:38.149 --> 11:39.279
how I felt about the trip."

11:39.289 --> 11:42.259
To be clear, I didn't have

11:39.289 --> 11:42.259
a relapse on the trip.

11:42.269 --> 11:44.210
I was just under

11:42.269 --> 11:44.210
so much stress,

11:44.220 --> 11:46.009
and I was just having

11:46.019 --> 11:48.289
such a horrible time

11:46.019 --> 11:48.289
I just couldn't eat.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.100
- How long have you

11:49.000 --> 11:50.100
had this problem?

11:50.110 --> 11:52.019
- I became a bulimic

11:50.110 --> 11:52.019
when I was 11.

11:52.029 --> 11:53.019
- You what?

11:53.029 --> 11:54.059
- I was a bulimic

11:53.029 --> 11:54.059
when I was 11.

11:54.070 --> 11:56.279
- I just want the girls to know

11:54.070 --> 11:56.279
how hyperaware I am

11:56.289 --> 11:58.090
of my weight,

11:58.100 --> 12:00.200
and some of the struggles

11:58.100 --> 12:00.200
that I go through.

12:00.210 --> 12:03.200
I will say that,

12:00.210 --> 12:03.200
like, it's under control.

12:03.210 --> 12:05.000
- Good!

12:05.009 --> 12:06.289
- But it's not something

12:05.009 --> 12:06.289
that I've ever hidden

12:07.000 --> 12:07.269
because it's been so long,

12:07.279 --> 12:11.049
or I'm not suffering

12:07.279 --> 12:11.049
on a daily about it.

12:11.059 --> 12:15.139
I was 11 years old

12:11.059 --> 12:15.139
when I watched a video in class

12:15.149 --> 12:16.269
about eating disorders,

12:16.279 --> 12:18.240
and obviously it was

12:16.279 --> 12:18.240
a negative message.

12:18.250 --> 12:21.080
And then I sort of picked up

12:18.250 --> 12:21.080
some tools from it,

12:21.090 --> 12:23.110
and that's when it began.

12:21.090 --> 12:23.110
Even, like, in high school,

12:23.120 --> 12:25.230
I felt very, like,

12:23.120 --> 12:25.230
normal to talk about it.

12:25.240 --> 12:27.230
Like it was,

12:25.240 --> 12:27.230
I have a grasp at it,

12:27.240 --> 12:30.100
and I think that was also

12:27.240 --> 12:30.100
part of my sickness.

12:30.110 --> 12:32.210
Like, "Oh, I can talk about it.

12:30.110 --> 12:32.210
I'm normal about it."

12:32.220 --> 12:33.220
- Right.

12:33.230 --> 12:35.110
- I think everyone's experience

12:33.230 --> 12:35.110
is different.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.159
- Wow.

12:36.169 --> 12:38.080
- But by you sharing that,

12:36.169 --> 12:38.080
it's going to help someone.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.220
- I watched a lot of movies...

12:38.090 --> 12:39.220
- Sure does.

12:39.230 --> 12:40.269
It will help someone.

12:40.279 --> 12:43.110
- I think Amelia being so brave

12:43.120 --> 12:45.289
and so honest

12:43.120 --> 12:45.289
about her story...

12:46.000 --> 12:49.090
- There's so much I need to say

12:46.000 --> 12:49.090
about anorexia

12:49.100 --> 12:52.000
because, like, I could've died.

12:52.009 --> 12:53.250
- It helped Kyle come out,

12:52.009 --> 12:53.250
I think.

12:53.259 --> 12:56.039
- When I was younger,

12:53.259 --> 12:56.039
I had my own problems.

12:56.049 --> 12:57.090
- Did you?

12:56.049 --> 12:57.090
- Yeah.

12:57.100 --> 13:00.039
But I never wanted to say

12:57.100 --> 13:00.039
because I never wanted my kids

13:00.049 --> 13:01.250
to have that problem,

13:00.049 --> 13:01.250
you know what I mean?

13:01.259 --> 13:04.019
- I love that Crystal has just

13:01.259 --> 13:04.019
been this open

13:04.029 --> 13:06.070
because

13:04.029 --> 13:06.070
once you are honest about it,

13:06.080 --> 13:08.049
it helps you

13:06.080 --> 13:08.049
and it helps other people.

13:08.059 --> 13:10.279
- I didn't think I would

13:08.059 --> 13:10.279
actually talk about that.

13:10.289 --> 13:14.090
- Let me hug you

13:10.289 --> 13:14.090
because that's a big deal.

13:14.100 --> 13:15.240
That was brave.

13:15.250 --> 13:17.070
- I'm nervous

13:15.250 --> 13:17.070
about this election.

13:17.080 --> 13:18.090
- Are you?

13:18.100 --> 13:19.200
- It almost can't be that bad

13:19.210 --> 13:20.289
because

13:19.210 --> 13:20.289
it already was that bad.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.039
- It won't be.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.039
It's only 4 more years.

13:22.049 --> 13:23.149
That's the way I look at it.

13:23.159 --> 13:27.029
- I'm going to Costa Rica maybe

13:23.159 --> 13:27.029
if it doesn't go well tonight.

13:27.039 --> 13:30.009
- You know what, we're not...

13:27.039 --> 13:30.009
- Uh-oh.

13:30.019 --> 13:32.120
- No, come on, come on.

13:30.019 --> 13:32.120
- Come talk to me for a second.

13:32.129 --> 13:35.019
- There's enough stuff

13:32.129 --> 13:35.019
going on.

13:35.029 --> 13:36.129
- Let me talk

13:35.029 --> 13:36.129
to you for a minute.

13:36.139 --> 13:38.200
- Where? Here?

13:36.139 --> 13:38.200
- No.

13:40.240 --> 13:43.080
I'm coming to paddle you

13:40.240 --> 13:43.080
for your behavior on the plane.

13:43.090 --> 13:46.019
- Excuse me?

13:46.029 --> 13:47.279
- I don't know why this is

13:46.029 --> 13:47.279
in here, actually.

13:47.289 --> 13:49.240
- Really, you don't know why

13:47.289 --> 13:49.240
that's in there?

13:49.250 --> 13:51.179
I don't know why

13:49.250 --> 13:51.179
you have a paddle.

13:51.190 --> 13:53.000
- I just wanted

13:51.190 --> 13:53.000
to talk to you...

13:53.009 --> 13:54.039
- Food.

13:54.049 --> 13:56.049
- About what happened

13:54.049 --> 13:56.049
on the plane.

13:56.059 --> 13:57.049
- Okay.

13:57.059 --> 13:59.059
- This is not the first time

13:57.059 --> 13:59.059
this has happened

13:59.070 --> 14:00.259
between Dorit and me.

14:00.269 --> 14:03.129
We've had this conversation

14:00.269 --> 14:03.129
before in this exact room,

14:03.139 --> 14:05.019
and I poured

14:03.139 --> 14:05.019
my heart out to her.

14:05.029 --> 14:07.070
I really do love you,

14:05.029 --> 14:07.070
and I feel like

14:07.080 --> 14:10.289
we're a friendship that's going

14:07.080 --> 14:10.289
to last a lifetime.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.179
And I really don't want to see

14:11.000 --> 14:14.179
that just tossed away

14:14.190 --> 14:15.230
over stupid, petty crap.

14:15.240 --> 14:18.259
I cannot keep doing this

14:15.240 --> 14:18.259
with her every couple months.

14:18.269 --> 14:21.029
Either we fix it

14:18.269 --> 14:21.029
and put a stop to this,

14:21.039 --> 14:22.259
or we're not

14:21.039 --> 14:22.259
going to be friends.

14:22.269 --> 14:26.009
On the plane, I only wanted

14:22.269 --> 14:26.009
to say one thing to Crystal,

14:26.019 --> 14:28.009
and you screamed at me.

14:28.019 --> 14:29.259
You said, "Can I just

14:28.019 --> 14:29.259
finish my sentence?"

14:29.269 --> 14:33.059
If anyone else had jumped in

14:29.269 --> 14:33.059
and, like, chimed in like that,

14:33.070 --> 14:35.289
you would have not had

14:33.070 --> 14:35.289
that same reaction.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.019
I feel like you treat me

14:36.000 --> 14:38.019
differently than the others,

14:38.029 --> 14:40.019
and I don't know what that is.

14:40.029 --> 14:44.009
- Okay, first off,

14:40.029 --> 14:44.009
last year you interrupted me

14:44.019 --> 14:47.039
in the middle of my sentences

14:44.019 --> 14:47.039
a lot.

14:47.049 --> 14:49.149
You and I had--

14:47.049 --> 14:49.149
then from there I said...

14:49.159 --> 14:51.259
- But you...

14:49.159 --> 14:51.259
- Own up to what you did...

14:51.269 --> 14:54.220
- For crying out loud, let me--

14:51.269 --> 14:54.220
- You never stop talking!

14:56.029 --> 14:59.029
- And it's almost as if you

14:56.029 --> 14:59.029
don't feel what I have to say

14:59.039 --> 15:02.190
has as much value

14:59.039 --> 15:02.190
as what you have to say.

15:02.200 --> 15:06.070
You scream this all the time,

15:02.200 --> 15:06.070
"You talk too much.

15:06.080 --> 15:07.269
I never get a chance."

15:07.279 --> 15:09.139
The only thing I said was,

15:07.279 --> 15:09.139
"Let me finish a sentence."

15:09.149 --> 15:11.039
- No, you screamed that at me,

15:09.149 --> 15:11.039
Dorit. And what's...

15:11.049 --> 15:13.059
- No, but, Kyle,

15:11.049 --> 15:13.059
it's only that you interrupt

15:13.070 --> 15:14.159
in mid-sentence, that's all.

15:14.169 --> 15:16.009
- No, honey, 45 minutes...

15:16.019 --> 15:18.240
- I was not talking

15:16.019 --> 15:18.240
for 45 minutes.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.090
- We hung out last week.

15:20.100 --> 15:21.269
The wives were away,

15:20.100 --> 15:21.269
and the girls rang.

15:21.279 --> 15:23.250
Do you remember

15:21.279 --> 15:23.250
we put the phones together,

15:23.259 --> 15:25.029
and we were so drunk,

15:23.259 --> 15:25.029
I said, "Watch this."

15:25.039 --> 15:26.120
- We were right here

15:25.039 --> 15:26.120
at this bar.

15:26.129 --> 15:29.009
- I put Kyle

15:26.129 --> 15:29.009
on speaker on his phone,

15:29.019 --> 15:31.009
Dorit on speaker on my phone.

15:29.019 --> 15:31.009
I put the two phones together.

15:31.019 --> 15:32.039
I put them over there,

15:32.049 --> 15:33.149
and we just

15:32.049 --> 15:33.149
carried on drinking.

15:33.159 --> 15:34.279
- Nice!

15:33.159 --> 15:34.279
- And they kept talking,

15:34.289 --> 15:36.169
and they had no idea

15:34.289 --> 15:36.169
that we weren't listening.

15:36.179 --> 15:38.100
- They'd been together

15:36.179 --> 15:38.100
the whole night,

15:38.110 --> 15:39.240
and they carried on talking.

15:39.250 --> 15:40.279
- Fantastic!

15:41.000 --> 15:42.059
- Am I an important

15:41.000 --> 15:42.059
friend to you?

15:42.070 --> 15:43.149
- Yes, I just said that.

15:43.159 --> 15:45.149
- Do you want to make

15:43.159 --> 15:45.149
this effort with me?

15:45.159 --> 15:48.059
Like, do you want to invest

15:45.159 --> 15:48.059
in our friendship like this?

15:48.070 --> 15:49.159
- I think I have.

15:49.169 --> 15:52.080
- Then don't ever talk to me

15:49.169 --> 15:52.080
like that again

15:52.090 --> 15:53.279
because that's not

15:52.090 --> 15:53.279
what friends do.

15:53.289 --> 15:55.100
- You're actually

15:53.289 --> 15:55.100
turning around to me

15:55.110 --> 15:58.029
and putting our friendship on

15:55.110 --> 15:58.029
the line because I said to you,

15:58.039 --> 16:01.019
"Can you not interrupt

15:58.039 --> 16:01.019
another sentence of mine?"

16:01.029 --> 16:03.129
- Yeah, but friends don't do--

16:01.029 --> 16:03.129
it was one time I spoke.

16:03.139 --> 16:07.090
- Should I say that last year

16:03.139 --> 16:07.090
you said, "(BLEEP) you, Dorit.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.279
(BLEEP) you!"

16:07.100 --> 16:09.279
You break down in tears!

16:09.289 --> 16:11.179
- (BLEEP) you!

16:09.289 --> 16:11.179
(BLEEP) you, Dorit.

16:11.190 --> 16:15.019
You can't tell me how I feel

16:11.190 --> 16:15.019
and react to things, okay?

16:15.029 --> 16:17.049
- Did I turn around and say

16:15.029 --> 16:17.049
to you after that,

16:17.059 --> 16:18.179
"You know what,

16:17.059 --> 16:18.179
you want to be friends with me,

16:18.190 --> 16:20.000
don't ever speak to me

16:18.190 --> 16:20.000
that way?"

16:20.009 --> 16:22.120
No, I didn't.

16:22.129 --> 16:24.090
- Last year we were

16:22.129 --> 16:24.090
in a heated moment.

16:24.100 --> 16:26.120
Everyone was at the table

16:24.100 --> 16:26.120
in a heated moment.

16:26.129 --> 16:28.129
On the plane,

16:26.129 --> 16:28.129
it was calm and nice.

16:28.139 --> 16:30.039
I was waiting for an in,

16:28.139 --> 16:30.039
waiting for an in,

16:30.049 --> 16:32.000
and I didn't want

16:30.049 --> 16:32.000
to be accused of that,

16:32.009 --> 16:33.070
so I was trying

16:32.009 --> 16:33.070
to be respectful

16:33.080 --> 16:34.129
because I do care about you.

16:34.139 --> 16:36.100
And I know what you said

16:34.139 --> 16:36.100
last year, and I heard that.

16:36.110 --> 16:37.149
And I took it to heart.

16:37.159 --> 16:39.129
- Okay, well then

16:37.159 --> 16:39.129
we're good, Kyle.

16:39.139 --> 16:40.210
We're good.

16:39.139 --> 16:40.210
Let's go back to your guests.

16:40.220 --> 16:43.049
- I want to really be good and

16:40.220 --> 16:43.049
not just say that we're good.

16:43.059 --> 16:44.190
- We're good. We're good.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.070
- Now you're doing the Erika,

16:44.200 --> 16:46.070
"We're good."

16:46.080 --> 16:50.269
- I'm good. I'm good.

16:46.080 --> 16:50.269
I don't want to do this.

16:50.279 --> 16:53.110
- We're good. We're good.

16:50.279 --> 16:53.110
I'm fine.

16:53.120 --> 16:54.169
- Why are you walking away?

16:54.179 --> 16:58.049
- Because I'm done.

16:58.059 --> 16:59.289
- Coming up...

17:00.000 --> 17:03.230
- Could I be a little gauche

17:00.000 --> 17:03.230
and ask how much that would go?

17:03.240 --> 17:05.000
Can I ask?

17:05.009 --> 17:06.059
- This particular one

17:05.009 --> 17:06.059
about 380.

17:06.069 --> 17:07.089
- Okay.

17:11.210 --> 17:12.130
- Okay, well then

17:12.029 --> 17:12.130
we're good, Kyle.

17:13.069 --> 17:15.089
Good.

17:13.069 --> 17:15.089
- Why are you walking away?

17:15.099 --> 17:17.009
- Because I'm done.

17:17.019 --> 17:18.170
[tense music]

17:18.180 --> 17:20.099
- [sighs]

17:22.200 --> 17:24.140
- I'm just, like, really

17:22.200 --> 17:24.140
disappointed in her right now,

17:24.150 --> 17:27.099
and if you hadn't brought my

17:24.150 --> 17:27.099
dad tonight, I wouldn't leave.

17:27.109 --> 17:29.039
But I do want

17:27.109 --> 17:29.039
to get back to my parents'.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.130
- Are we going?

17:29.049 --> 17:30.130
- I'd like to.

17:30.140 --> 17:32.170
- Okay, well, immediately?

17:30.140 --> 17:32.170
Or straight away?

17:32.180 --> 17:34.150
- Immediately, if not sooner.

17:32.180 --> 17:34.150
- I guess that's it then, huh?

17:36.000 --> 17:39.160
- Thank you, Rob.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.160
Moe, I love you.

17:39.170 --> 17:41.049
- Who's winning?

17:41.059 --> 17:42.220
- Biden's in the lead.

17:41.059 --> 17:42.220
- Oh, Portia,

17:42.230 --> 17:46.200
this is your patriotic wear,

17:42.230 --> 17:46.200
with your orange scrunchie?

17:49.039 --> 17:51.170
- Guys, I love you.

17:49.039 --> 17:51.170
- Are you leaving?

17:51.180 --> 17:52.160
- I love you.

17:51.180 --> 17:52.160
- Are you leaving?

17:52.170 --> 17:54.069
- I am. My dad just came in

17:52.170 --> 17:54.069
this morning.

17:54.079 --> 17:55.130
- Go see your dad!

17:55.140 --> 17:56.220
- I know, and I told them

17:55.140 --> 17:56.220
I'd be gone

17:56.230 --> 17:59.119
for a couple of hours,

17:56.230 --> 17:59.119
but I want to see them.

17:59.130 --> 18:01.009
Love you.

17:59.130 --> 18:01.009
Bye, guys.

18:01.019 --> 18:03.049
I came to Kyle's party

18:01.019 --> 18:03.049
because she's my friend.

18:03.059 --> 18:05.200
- Why can't we stay

18:03.059 --> 18:05.200
a little longer, eat...

18:05.210 --> 18:08.119
- Let me see my parents.

18:08.130 --> 18:10.079
But if she's going

18:08.130 --> 18:10.079
to treatment me like this,

18:10.089 --> 18:12.160
I don't need to be here.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.160
I'm ready to go.

18:12.170 --> 18:14.099
- Love you. Bye, darling.

18:20.180 --> 18:22.130
- [sighs]

18:22.140 --> 18:26.049
So annoying. Not fun.

18:26.059 --> 18:27.109
- Didn't really eat anything.

18:27.119 --> 18:28.170
We were in the middle

18:27.119 --> 18:28.170
of a conversation.

18:28.180 --> 18:30.019
- You had a hamburger

18:28.180 --> 18:30.019
before you left

18:30.029 --> 18:31.160
an hour and a half ago.

18:30.029 --> 18:31.160
- No, but I'm just saying.

18:31.170 --> 18:33.059
They could throw it as,

18:33.069 --> 18:34.230
that we were rude,

18:33.069 --> 18:34.230
we left early.

18:34.240 --> 18:36.119
We didn't eat.

18:34.240 --> 18:36.119
You know, I'm just saying.

18:36.130 --> 18:37.240
- Well, that's not

18:36.130 --> 18:37.240
what friends do, PK,

18:37.250 --> 18:39.039
and it's definitely not

18:39.049 --> 18:41.079
what friends do

18:39.049 --> 18:41.079
what she did tonight.

18:41.089 --> 18:43.039
- Hi, sit down.

18:43.049 --> 18:45.019
- [sighs]

18:43.049 --> 18:45.019
- Are we okay?

18:45.029 --> 18:47.049
- Feeling bad Dorit left

18:45.029 --> 18:47.049
'cause she got upset with me.

18:47.059 --> 18:48.180
- No, no, no! Her dad...

18:47.059 --> 18:48.180
- No, she was here...

18:48.190 --> 18:50.059
She already said her dad

18:48.190 --> 18:50.059
just arrived.

18:50.069 --> 18:53.079
- PK wanted to stay.

18:50.069 --> 18:53.079
- Did you guys not work it out?

18:53.089 --> 18:55.019
- I just want to nip it

18:53.089 --> 18:55.019
in the bud.

18:55.029 --> 18:57.089
- She's just happy she's not

18:55.029 --> 18:57.089
in the middle of this one.

18:57.099 --> 18:58.210
[laughter]

18:58.220 --> 19:01.170
- I love you, mother...

18:58.220 --> 19:01.170
- Praise baby Jesus!

19:01.180 --> 19:05.029
- Look, you guys!

19:01.180 --> 19:05.029
- We are now hearing at 11:41

19:05.039 --> 19:09.089
from both sides that a winner

19:05.039 --> 19:09.089
will not be determined tonight.

19:09.099 --> 19:11.240
- Neither campaign expects

19:09.099 --> 19:11.240
there to be a result tonight?

19:11.250 --> 19:13.250
- Correct.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.250
- It's all too early to call.

19:13.259 --> 19:15.140
- Too early to call!

19:15.150 --> 19:19.079
- This is just a big,

19:15.150 --> 19:19.079
anticlimactic evening, Kyle.

19:19.089 --> 19:26.099
♪ ♪

19:29.240 --> 19:31.220
- This one's fancy.

19:35.140 --> 19:37.170
- Well!

19:37.180 --> 19:40.069
- Welcome to my private

19:37.180 --> 19:40.069
Bentley shopping day.

19:40.079 --> 19:41.119
- Oh, my God.

19:41.130 --> 19:44.039
- I wanted to be able to enjoy

19:41.130 --> 19:44.039
it without our masks on,

19:44.049 --> 19:45.180
so they closed it up for us.

19:45.190 --> 19:47.230
- Well, of course!

19:45.190 --> 19:47.230
Wow!

19:47.240 --> 19:50.160
- When you shop for couture,

19:47.240 --> 19:50.160
you're by yourself.

19:50.170 --> 19:53.069
You get to try it on

19:50.170 --> 19:53.069
by yourself,

19:53.079 --> 19:55.210
so this makes

19:53.079 --> 19:55.210
complete sense to me.

19:55.220 --> 19:57.029
This is how you shop.

19:57.039 --> 19:58.079
- Okay, what are we

19:57.039 --> 19:58.079
looking for?

19:58.089 --> 19:59.150
- Okay.

19:58.089 --> 19:59.150
- What's our vibe?

19:59.160 --> 20:00.200
- I like a convertible.

20:00.210 --> 20:03.140
I came here on Saturday.

20:00.210 --> 20:03.140
I've seen a couple of models.

20:03.150 --> 20:04.109
- Okay.

20:04.119 --> 20:06.059
- And so I think

20:04.119 --> 20:06.059
I like this one and...

20:06.069 --> 20:07.259
- Maybe you get one,

20:06.069 --> 20:07.259
I get one, who knows?

20:07.269 --> 20:09.140
- Yeah, buy one, get one.

20:09.150 --> 20:12.200
- My very first car

20:09.150 --> 20:12.200
was a Toyota Tercel.

20:12.210 --> 20:16.190
Could I be a little gauche

20:12.210 --> 20:16.190
and ask how much that would go?

20:16.200 --> 20:17.240
Can I ask? You know me.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.109
- This particular one about

20:17.250 --> 20:19.109
380.

20:19.119 --> 20:20.099
- Okay.

20:20.109 --> 20:21.259
And then when

20:20.109 --> 20:21.259
I could afford something

20:21.269 --> 20:25.240
a little bit more fancy,

20:21.269 --> 20:25.240
I got a Mazda RX-7,

20:25.250 --> 20:28.039
and I didn't know

20:25.250 --> 20:28.039
how to drive a stick shift.

20:28.049 --> 20:31.230
So I'm leaving the dealer

20:28.049 --> 20:31.230
and I'm like this. [laughs]

20:31.240 --> 20:35.089
- See, I love that green,

20:31.240 --> 20:35.089
but I want a convertible.

20:35.099 --> 20:36.240
You missed Kyle's

20:35.099 --> 20:36.240
election party.

20:36.250 --> 20:38.039
- Yes! I was home.

20:38.049 --> 20:39.170
- Were you just at home

20:38.049 --> 20:39.170
with the boys.

20:39.180 --> 20:40.279
- I was home with the boys.

20:39.180 --> 20:40.279
They were upstairs.

20:40.289 --> 20:42.259
I tried to coerce them

20:40.289 --> 20:42.259
to come down.

20:42.269 --> 20:43.289
- Yeah.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.099
- They came down

20:44.000 --> 20:45.099
for five minutes,

20:45.109 --> 20:47.210
and then I had

20:45.109 --> 20:47.210
a glass of tequila.

20:47.220 --> 20:49.259
- I texted Erika yesterday.

20:47.220 --> 20:49.259
- And did she come?

20:49.269 --> 20:52.099
- No, she didn't come.

20:49.269 --> 20:52.099
- Okay, I was going to say.

20:52.109 --> 20:53.079
- And I ask Lisa.

20:53.089 --> 20:56.099
I said, "Did she mention

20:53.089 --> 20:56.099
anything to you?"

20:56.109 --> 20:57.250
And she's like, "No."

20:57.259 --> 21:00.089
- When my life started

20:57.259 --> 21:00.089
unraveling with my divorce,

21:00.099 --> 21:01.200
I didn't want to see people.

21:01.210 --> 21:04.079
I didn't want to do anything,

21:01.210 --> 21:04.079
and Erika it was in the press.

21:04.089 --> 21:05.190
People knew about it,

21:05.200 --> 21:08.150
so I can understand

21:05.200 --> 21:08.150
why she wouldn't show up.

21:08.160 --> 21:09.230

the top!

21:12.240 --> 21:15.160

They already know

21:22.140 --> 21:24.170
what I can afford.

21:25.289 --> 21:27.180

21:31.170 --> 21:33.180

21:33.190 --> 21:35.079
a little kick.

- Well, you know...

21:47.130 --> 21:49.099
- Like new house...

- Is this what we call

21:49.109 --> 21:51.170
a midlife crisis?

21:51.180 --> 21:53.269
- Men get Porsches

21:51.180 --> 21:53.269

21:53.279 --> 21:55.140
You get a Bentley.

First of all, we have to

23:13.000 --> 23:16.180

special for the three of them.

that you had told everybody

from an eating disorder.

- Good for you.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.170
- Yeah.

24:14.180 --> 24:18.009
- It's a weird topic

24:14.180 --> 24:18.009
to connect with someone.

24:18.019 --> 24:19.220
- Well, but you like food.

- I love food.

24:19.230 --> 24:21.029

24:21.039 --> 24:22.259

admit liking food.

- Because I had so much shame

24:27.019 --> 24:28.160
around food.

24:28.170 --> 24:29.250
- Right.

24:29.259 --> 24:32.190

24:29.259 --> 24:32.190
rooted in, like, my childhood.

24:32.200 --> 24:35.230

24:32.200 --> 24:35.230

24:35.240 --> 24:38.269

I totally wanted

24:38.279 --> 24:40.240
to be American,

24:40.250 --> 24:43.160

24:40.250 --> 24:43.160
as a child was white.

You know, I always felt like

the ugly kid.

24:51.180 --> 24:54.170

They're healthy."

"Okay, well that means

27:47.019 --> 27:48.210
I don't want to talk

27:47.019 --> 27:48.210
about it right now."

27:48.220 --> 27:50.069
- Yeah, so I guess I'll ask her

27:48.220 --> 27:50.069
if she's coming

27:50.079 --> 27:54.000
'cause I kind of need to know

27:50.079 --> 27:54.000
for catering purposes.

27:54.009 --> 27:55.230
- Yes.

27:54.009 --> 27:55.230
- Well, you can send her a text.

27:55.240 --> 27:57.279
Just say, "Are you going

27:55.240 --> 27:57.279
to be able to make it Saturday?

27:57.289 --> 27:59.059
I need a headcount."

27:59.069 --> 28:00.109
- She's quick.

28:00.119 --> 28:01.240
- She's a court reporter

28:00.119 --> 28:01.240
on the side.

28:01.250 --> 28:02.220
- I just said, "Hey, you.

28:02.230 --> 28:04.220
"I know you are swamped

28:02.230 --> 28:04.220
and no pressure.

28:04.230 --> 28:06.079
"Just wondering

28:04.230 --> 28:06.079
if you think you'll be up

28:06.089 --> 28:10.119
for coming on Saturday?"

28:06.089 --> 28:10.119
Let's just have a nice lunch.

28:10.130 --> 28:13.029
I am trying to move some of

28:10.130 --> 28:13.029
the things from the store

28:13.039 --> 28:14.109
into my house

28:14.119 --> 28:17.000
so it kind of feels

28:14.119 --> 28:17.000
very Parisian.

28:17.009 --> 28:18.220
- I really do not think

28:18.230 --> 28:21.000
that you need

28:18.230 --> 28:21.000
that piece of furniture there,

28:21.009 --> 28:23.049
and I see that

28:21.009 --> 28:23.049
that closet is empty.

28:23.059 --> 28:24.230
- That's...

28:23.059 --> 28:24.230
- That's a bathroom.

28:24.240 --> 28:26.230
- Oh.

28:24.240 --> 28:26.230
- That's the powder room.

28:26.240 --> 28:29.220
- Okay.

28:26.240 --> 28:29.220
- Which we need.

28:29.230 --> 28:32.269
- Yes, you do.

28:29.230 --> 28:32.269
- We like to give advice.

28:32.279 --> 28:34.200
- Otherwise, no,

28:32.279 --> 28:34.200
otherwise it's...

28:34.210 --> 28:36.240
- How I survived all this time

28:34.210 --> 28:36.240
without y'all, I don't know.

28:36.250 --> 28:38.039
- I don't know how.

28:38.049 --> 28:40.039
- Kathy's used to being

28:38.049 --> 28:40.039
the oldest sister

28:40.049 --> 28:42.200
and sort of

28:40.049 --> 28:42.200
bossing people around.

28:42.210 --> 28:43.250
- And what's behind here?

28:43.259 --> 28:46.279
- That's like our kitchen

28:43.259 --> 28:46.279
and stuff.

28:46.289 --> 28:48.089
- I'm not allowed to swear.

28:48.099 --> 28:49.210
I shouldn't be wearing

28:48.099 --> 28:49.210
certain things.

28:49.220 --> 28:51.099
And now it's rolled

28:49.220 --> 28:51.099
into my kids.

28:51.109 --> 28:54.049
They'll put something on

28:51.109 --> 28:54.049
and I'll say, "Don't wear that.

28:54.059 --> 28:56.079
Aunt Kathy's

28:54.059 --> 28:56.079
not going to like that."

28:56.089 --> 28:58.079
- Oh, Erika texted me back.

28:56.089 --> 28:58.079
She is coming.

28:58.089 --> 28:59.240
- She's coming?

28:58.089 --> 28:59.240
- Oh, good.

28:59.250 --> 29:01.019
- Okay, good.

29:01.029 --> 29:02.059
- When I was going through

29:01.029 --> 29:02.059
my divorce,

29:02.069 --> 29:05.000
if I got invited to something,

29:02.069 --> 29:05.000
it gave me a reason

29:05.009 --> 29:06.099
to get out of bed,

29:06.109 --> 29:08.250
put on clothes

29:06.109 --> 29:08.250
and try to be around people.

29:08.259 --> 29:11.140
That's the best thing

29:08.259 --> 29:11.140
she can do for herself.

29:11.150 --> 29:13.210
I think we should

29:11.150 --> 29:13.210
take it easy on her, you know?

29:13.220 --> 29:15.119
- Why wouldn't we?

29:13.220 --> 29:15.119
- Yeah, don't bombard her.

29:15.130 --> 29:17.019
- People talk

29:15.130 --> 29:17.019
when they want to.

29:17.029 --> 29:18.289
- Why would we do anything

29:17.029 --> 29:18.289
other than take it easy on her?

29:19.000 --> 29:21.049
- Let's not ask her

29:19.000 --> 29:21.049
any questions.

29:21.059 --> 29:23.029
- Do you need this desk here?

29:23.039 --> 29:25.220

"We'd better have a garden

30:01.150 --> 30:04.240
because it's going to be

Armageddon at any moment."

30:04.250 --> 30:06.140
Hey, we have a pumpkin!

30:06.150 --> 30:08.049
- Yeah, that's actually

30:06.150 --> 30:08.049
ready to harvest.

30:08.059 --> 30:10.019
- He literally went on

30:08.059 --> 30:10.019
the Internet and was like,

30:10.029 --> 30:11.029
"How do I grow a garden?"

30:11.039 --> 30:15.029
He decided to first build

30:11.039 --> 30:15.029
a little garden up above

30:15.039 --> 30:16.269
on the deck in a box,

30:16.279 --> 30:19.049
and it went so well

30:16.279 --> 30:19.049
that then he said

30:19.059 --> 30:21.009
I'm going to build

30:19.059 --> 30:21.009
a garden down there.

30:21.019 --> 30:23.119

30:26.000 --> 30:29.279
The house is becoming

30:26.000 --> 30:29.279
quite sustainable, shall we say.

30:29.289 --> 30:31.109
Is this your compost thing?

- That's my compost thing,

30:31.119 --> 30:33.000
yeah.

30:33.009 --> 30:34.039
- What do you do with it?

30:34.049 --> 30:35.059
- Well, you take

30:34.049 --> 30:35.059
all the cuttings

30:35.069 --> 30:38.069
and all the stuff that,

30:35.069 --> 30:38.069
you know, you left over,

30:38.079 --> 30:42.099
and you put it in there

30:38.079 --> 30:42.099
and chop it all up.

30:42.109 --> 30:44.029
- What are we doing that for?

30:44.039 --> 30:46.089
- Out comes the best soil

30:44.039 --> 30:46.089
you can possibly have.

30:46.099 --> 30:48.119
- Oh, so you put it all here

30:46.099 --> 30:48.119
so the plants will grow?

30:48.130 --> 30:49.160
- That's right.

30:49.170 --> 30:51.160
- Did you put poop in there?

30:49.170 --> 30:51.160
- No.

30:51.170 --> 30:53.079
- No, right?

30:51.170 --> 30:53.079
Like, no fertilizer, like,

30:53.089 --> 30:56.289
it becomes fertilizer but

30:53.089 --> 30:56.289
you don't put poop in there.

- No.

31:07.160 --> 31:08.289
We've got to do the fire drill.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.039
- We should go do it.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.039
- We have to do that

31:10.049 --> 31:12.009
because there are going to be

31:10.049 --> 31:12.009
Santa Ana winds coming.

- Let's go do it.

There is a fine line

31:16.119 --> 31:18.279
between quirky and paranoid.

31:18.289 --> 31:20.130
- This is not really

31:18.289 --> 31:20.130
a swimming pool.

31:20.140 --> 31:22.000
This is a reservoir.

32:49.109 --> 32:51.089
the first time

32:51.099 --> 32:53.109
