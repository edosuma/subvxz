WEBVTT

00:02.330 --> 00:04.480
So that happened, huh?

00:04.710 --> 00:09.480
To think that that's how I'd reunite with Kazuhiko.

00:09.900 --> 00:17.490
It seems a lot of different feelings were 
colliding in and around this town.

00:18.270 --> 00:20.100
What are Minori and the others doing?

00:20.100 --> 00:22.640
They're safe, I suppose, but...

02:50.180 --> 02:52.900
<i>In the end, I couldn't make him understand.</i>

02:53.330 --> 02:56.050
<i>I couldn't save the town.</i>

02:56.530 --> 02:59.350
<i>I wasn't really useful...</i>

02:59.950 --> 03:00.930
<i>I...</i>

03:12.460 --> 03:18.420
<b>The Skylarks Take Flight</b>

03:14.300 --> 03:16.040
The Skylarks Take Flight.

03:22.810 --> 03:24.830
This will take us to Ikoma, right?

03:25.130 --> 03:26.180
Yeah.

03:26.180 --> 03:28.620
Then you're leaving?

03:28.620 --> 03:32.440
I do have someplace I'm trying to reach.

03:32.440 --> 03:35.070
But I don't know where I'll ultimately end up.

03:36.220 --> 03:37.400
Oh, right.

03:37.770 --> 03:41.070
I'd like you to give this to...

03:41.380 --> 03:42.930
your brother, I suppose.

03:43.550 --> 03:44.930
To Shiroe?

03:44.930 --> 03:46.080
Yeah.

03:46.690 --> 03:47.670
Um...

03:50.590 --> 03:53.080
No, all right.

03:53.820 --> 03:56.590
Okay, off I go.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.940
It's such nice weather, you know.

03:58.940 --> 04:01.060
A little too nice...

04:08.330 --> 04:10.100
Thank you.

04:16.100 --> 04:19.450
Would you call me "big sister" one more time?

04:20.310 --> 04:22.520
Goodbye, big sister!

04:23.530 --> 04:24.860
I love the sound of that!

04:25.230 --> 04:26.290
Sis...

04:27.170 --> 04:28.630
Sister Roe 2...

04:28.630 --> 04:30.590
Goodbye, big sister.

04:31.230 --> 04:33.750
Let's meet again someday, big sister.

04:34.460 --> 04:35.310
Yeah.

04:37.130 --> 04:42.000
Let us meet again, my little brothers and sisters!

04:45.960 --> 04:47.310
She's gone.

04:47.310 --> 04:49.410
I'll be on my way, as well.

04:49.840 --> 04:51.730
I wish I could stay, but...

04:52.910 --> 04:56.650
Someone's come to meet me 
at Sanaru, just up the road.

04:58.580 --> 05:01.770
It was fun meeting you all.

05:02.230 --> 05:05.030
I hope we can meet again somewhere, someday.

05:05.930 --> 05:07.000
Yes.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.830
We feel the same way.

05:29.430 --> 05:32.240
Was it really all right to let her go like that?

05:32.240 --> 05:33.270
What do you mean?

05:33.660 --> 05:35.440
Miss Dariella.

05:35.440 --> 05:36.390
Oh...

05:43.680 --> 05:44.960
It's fine.

05:45.450 --> 05:46.320
Okay.

05:49.250 --> 05:51.640
You know, Dariella...

05:52.490 --> 05:55.100
Her nails were all chewed up.

05:55.100 --> 05:57.440
Like she'd bitten them because she was suffering.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.830
Is that so?

06:03.370 --> 06:06.410
<i>You were always watching her, weren't you?</i>

06:07.140 --> 06:10.850
<i>And I'm sure it's because you are 
who you are that you were able</i>

06:12.010 --> 06:13.550
<i>to notice her pain.</i>

06:14.600 --> 06:17.810
Do you ever bite your nails, Tohya?

06:17.810 --> 06:20.690
Hmm... No, now that I think of it.

06:20.690 --> 06:22.260
Not since I came here.

06:22.260 --> 06:23.360
I'm glad to hear it.

06:23.860 --> 06:25.590
What, Rudy?

06:25.590 --> 06:28.610
If you want to say something, say it.

06:30.340 --> 06:33.180
Well, Tohya, if something's bothering you,

06:33.180 --> 06:35.620
just come talk to me, Rundel Haus Code.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.990
Talk to you? About what?

06:37.990 --> 06:39.880
About romance.

06:40.920 --> 06:44.990
No, if I were going to ask someone 
about that, it wouldn't be you!

06:44.990 --> 06:46.130
What?!

06:59.420 --> 07:02.170
Welcome back, Lady Nureha.

07:02.170 --> 07:03.670
We were worried.

07:27.510 --> 07:30.270
Can we just leave them like this?

07:31.150 --> 07:35.360
Maybe we could stay a little longer 
and help with the cleanup.

07:35.360 --> 07:40.390
No, we have the wyvern skins, 
and we can get the rest in Akihabara.

07:40.840 --> 07:43.800
We've accomplished our goal, 
so we shouldn't stay here too long.

07:44.270 --> 07:47.020
But just leaving doesn't feel right...

07:47.020 --> 07:49.130
Don't worry.

07:49.130 --> 07:51.440
This is an important stop on the Red Road.

07:51.440 --> 07:53.260
It'll be back up in no time.

07:53.260 --> 07:55.820
Well, now that you mention it,

07:55.820 --> 07:58.620
the people don't seem that upset.

07:58.620 --> 08:01.440
They're used to this stuff.

08:01.440 --> 08:02.540
For better or worse...

08:03.030 --> 08:07.010
But I don't think having more people can hurt.

08:07.010 --> 08:08.920
If we can help a little...

08:09.360 --> 08:11.790
No, it's really okay.

08:11.790 --> 08:14.190
Help will come from the neighboring towns.

08:14.190 --> 08:16.040
And, well...

08:16.040 --> 08:20.580
Sometimes, it's better to not 
have any outsiders around...

08:22.070 --> 08:24.600
Are you trying to be nice, Rudy?

08:24.600 --> 08:27.820
Like, we should leave the People of the 
Land's problems to them or something?

08:28.090 --> 08:30.260
Anyway, there's no need to worry!

08:30.260 --> 08:32.380
They'll be just fine on their own.

08:33.680 --> 08:36.700
Well, if you say so.

08:36.700 --> 08:37.830
Yeah.

08:40.840 --> 08:44.670
Don't you think it was fate 
that brought us together?

08:46.640 --> 08:49.020
What? Does he think he's hitting on us?

08:49.020 --> 08:51.330
Isn't he creepy?

08:51.330 --> 08:54.720
Would you please become my beautiful bride?

08:54.720 --> 08:57.170
What burger should we have today?

08:57.170 --> 08:59.030
Or should we have rice balls?

08:59.430 --> 09:02.180
Is that what we're doing for lunch again?

09:02.520 --> 09:03.770
That's right.

09:03.770 --> 09:07.440
We also need to decide where we'll 
get delivery from for dinner.

09:07.770 --> 09:11.530
Well, there's nothing wrong with eating out,

09:11.530 --> 09:15.540
but since Nyanta left, are we really 
getting enough nutrition?

09:15.540 --> 09:17.450
If my skin gets ruined,

09:17.450 --> 09:21.200
fans all over the galaxy will go crazy 
and cause another Big Bang!

09:21.620 --> 09:26.920
If you have time to talk nonsense, 
why don't you make something yourself?

09:26.920 --> 09:27.990
That's right.

09:27.990 --> 09:31.650
Akatsuki and I both gave it a try.

09:31.650 --> 09:32.960
A try.

09:36.970 --> 09:40.470
An idol isn't allowed to make anything but sweets!

09:40.470 --> 09:42.180
What the heck?

09:44.980 --> 09:47.020
Hey, are you okay?

09:48.030 --> 09:49.220
What's wrong?

09:49.220 --> 09:50.770
Are you sick?

09:51.950 --> 09:53.780
It's nothing.

09:56.550 --> 10:02.060
Jeez, he must've been jealous of the obvious 
romance between me and Naotsugu.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.910
I've been thinking...

10:03.910 --> 10:07.600
Haven't there been a lot more 
people like that around?

10:08.540 --> 10:10.420
Yeah, you're right.

10:11.100 --> 10:15.420
It reminds me of when we 
first came to this world.

10:15.880 --> 10:18.090
At first, there was so much confusion,

10:18.090 --> 10:22.060
and then everyone just sat around, 
unable to do anything.

10:22.560 --> 10:25.680
Wait a second, it's only a coincidence.

10:25.680 --> 10:28.940
Look, there are happy people like that, too!

10:32.550 --> 10:35.380
You're overthinking it. Really!

10:35.380 --> 10:38.090
You may look like you only think about panties,

10:38.090 --> 10:41.570
but you're actually really delicate, 
aren't you, Naotsugu?

10:41.850 --> 10:42.830
What?

10:43.360 --> 10:45.220
Hey, are you going to ignore that?

10:45.220 --> 10:47.080
She just said pan—

10:51.170 --> 10:52.650
Ow...

10:52.650 --> 10:54.630
What's with them?

10:56.390 --> 10:58.600
<i>I'm overthinking it, huh?</i>

10:59.010 --> 11:00.220
<i>I hope so.</i>

11:00.770 --> 11:06.840
<i>But if the same sense of apathy 
is overcoming Akihabara...</i>

11:08.200 --> 11:10.590
<i>It might be worse than last time.</i>

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
<b>Eat Grass</b>

11:16.780 --> 11:22.660
This world tried to do something to me that 
I didn't want, regardless of my feelings.

11:22.660 --> 11:26.040
So I'm going to do what I want to it.

11:26.760 --> 11:29.470
<i>So Londark was talking like that...</i>

11:30.550 --> 11:33.570
<i>There are more and more adventurers 
who can't adapt to this world</i>

11:33.570 --> 11:36.050
<i>and are getting angry.</i>

11:36.590 --> 11:40.040
But there are people who 
can't adapt to this society.

11:40.040 --> 11:42.340
Are we just going to abandon them?

11:43.380 --> 11:48.030
<i>And adventurers like that are working with 
People of the Land who want to start wars.</i>

11:48.530 --> 11:50.850
<i>Sometimes, adventurers even 
encourage them to do so.</i>

11:52.620 --> 11:54.230
A war, huh?

11:55.220 --> 11:57.390
<i>I didn't think it would happen.</i>

11:57.390 --> 12:00.540
<i>Not between adventurers, at least.</i>

12:01.220 --> 12:04.610
<i>But if the People of the Land 
get involved, things change.</i>

12:05.550 --> 12:09.220
<i>War has always been a part of their lives.</i>

12:09.770 --> 12:12.290
<i>Unlike us, who were born in peaceful Japan.</i>

12:13.600 --> 12:20.010
<i>And once one starts, will we be able 
to continue to stay out of it?</i>

12:21.050 --> 12:23.280
Oh, damn it!

12:23.280 --> 12:25.450
<i>If this were a quest, there'd be no problem.</i>

12:25.450 --> 12:29.100
<i>Even if it were a fight, I can handle monsters.</i>

12:29.540 --> 12:30.460
<i>But...</i>

12:30.890 --> 12:32.590
<i>If a war starts between</i>

12:32.590 --> 12:35.630
<i>People of the Land and adventurers, 
or among adventurers themselves,</i>

12:36.160 --> 12:38.900
<i>what can the current Round Table do?</i>

12:39.920 --> 12:42.510
<i>It hurts not having Crusty here.</i>

12:43.060 --> 12:47.910
<i>I hope something comes of what I asked of Isaac...</i>

12:52.060 --> 12:53.060
Hey!

12:53.060 --> 12:55.160
Make them run faster!

12:55.940 --> 12:59.400
They're pathetic, giving up so easily.

12:59.830 --> 13:01.440
It can't be helped.

13:01.440 --> 13:04.030
People of the Land don't have that much stamina.

13:04.440 --> 13:08.430
The villain gave me the most boring jo—

13:09.700 --> 13:10.840
H-Hey...

13:10.840 --> 13:12.060
Work harder!

13:12.880 --> 13:14.460
Isaac?

13:14.460 --> 13:16.900
Sir Isaac!

13:22.130 --> 13:23.770
Sir Isaac...

13:25.270 --> 13:28.490
But why was Sara kidnapped?

13:28.490 --> 13:31.600
Hatred, I guess. The unjustified kind.

13:31.600 --> 13:32.700
Hatred?

13:33.140 --> 13:36.280
That Camus guy is no good.

13:36.280 --> 13:38.490
Supposedly, he's a People of the Land merchant.

13:38.490 --> 13:41.900
But he keeps hitting on every girl he sees.

13:41.900 --> 13:45.050
My, he hasn't hit on me.

13:46.730 --> 13:49.790
Anyway, he came after us, too.

13:51.520 --> 13:55.480
Would you please become my beautiful bride?

13:58.820 --> 14:02.040
He was creepy, so we ran away.

14:02.520 --> 14:05.490
But I guess another girl from 
our guild rejected him before,

14:05.870 --> 14:07.610
and he's holding a grudge.

14:08.110 --> 14:09.580
There he is!

14:18.810 --> 14:21.460
Isn't Sara acting weird?

14:21.460 --> 14:26.010
She looks more like she's been 
seduced than kidnapped.

14:26.010 --> 14:26.970
No way.

14:27.580 --> 14:30.380
Either way, he's no good!

14:30.380 --> 14:31.300
Kurinon...

14:32.880 --> 14:35.560
Bastard! What have you done to Sara?!

14:37.390 --> 14:39.560
Would you please become my beautiful...

14:39.560 --> 14:42.020
Heck, no!

14:42.650 --> 14:44.190
<b>Camus /Traveling Merchant</b>

14:42.650 --> 14:44.190
<b>Sara /Maid</b>

14:42.650 --> 14:44.190
<b>Kurinon /Priest, Lv. 91</b>

14:44.190 --> 14:45.960
<b>Genius of Marriage
Camaysar /Genius, Lv. 83
Rank /Party</b>

14:46.960 --> 14:48.210
The genius...

14:48.210 --> 14:49.200
...of marriage?

14:49.750 --> 14:50.500
Gotcha.

14:50.500 --> 14:51.370
Sara!

14:51.370 --> 14:54.370
It's okay, she's just knocked out.

14:56.750 --> 14:59.040
Fate must have brought us together.

15:00.270 --> 15:03.260
You want to get hit again, huh?!

15:11.270 --> 15:13.930
Would you please become my beautiful bride?

15:15.920 --> 15:19.060
I will...

15:19.620 --> 15:21.960
No way! Not Kurinon!

15:21.960 --> 15:23.020
Be careful!

15:23.540 --> 15:25.690
It looks like he's using some kind of strange skill!

15:27.270 --> 15:28.230
Souji!

15:28.230 --> 15:29.400
Sou!

15:29.950 --> 15:32.730
I suppose these weirdos

15:32.730 --> 15:35.790
are showing up now because the 
defensive barrier is gone.

15:37.710 --> 15:40.990
I won't let you deceive these girls!

15:42.830 --> 15:46.420
Would you please become my beautiful bride?

15:52.970 --> 15:55.390
How dare you say that to Sou?!

15:55.390 --> 15:57.470
Oh, my! You're into that sort of thing?

15:59.180 --> 16:01.560
There's a lot to carry!

16:02.220 --> 16:05.790
In times like these, I wish we had a magic bag...

16:05.790 --> 16:08.370
Well, this is all stuff to make a magic bag.

16:10.610 --> 16:12.320
I think you did great, Tohya.

16:13.520 --> 16:15.950
When you were talking with that knight...

16:16.470 --> 16:19.550
Is it that important

16:19.550 --> 16:21.500
whether you can die or not?

16:22.090 --> 16:25.810
Have you ever died?

16:26.390 --> 16:29.550
Did you ever die in the old world?

16:30.500 --> 16:33.050
You told him exactly how you felt.

16:33.510 --> 16:35.930
But I couldn't make him understand.

16:36.900 --> 16:39.060
That isn't true!

16:39.550 --> 16:42.780
Even if he doesn't understand yet, 
he won't forget it!

16:43.210 --> 16:46.240
I think there's meaning in the fact 
that you were able to say it.

16:47.580 --> 16:49.800
Everyone's so amazing.

16:49.800 --> 16:53.570
Minori, Tohya, Isuzu...

16:54.920 --> 16:57.160
Even Rudy, maybe.

16:57.160 --> 17:00.190
Everyone seems like they're 
really doing the right thing.

17:00.190 --> 17:02.090
So are you, Serara.

17:02.090 --> 17:03.080
No...

17:03.350 --> 17:09.340
On this journey, I realized that 
I have a long way to go...

17:10.210 --> 17:13.090
I'm glad I understood that, I think.

17:17.150 --> 17:19.320
We're going to have to walk home...

17:19.320 --> 17:21.440
You okay, Miss Isuzu?

17:21.440 --> 17:22.760
There...

17:22.760 --> 17:24.320
I'm fine.

17:24.320 --> 17:26.980
It isn't as far as I thought.

17:31.150 --> 17:35.860
Shall we ask the people around here if 
they need any of the stuff we don't?

17:37.160 --> 17:39.370
It might be better than throwing it away...

17:42.370 --> 17:43.710
It's strange.

17:43.710 --> 17:45.990
I thought they would protect us.

17:45.990 --> 17:48.380
But they were useless.

17:48.380 --> 17:50.810
Some heroes...

17:50.810 --> 17:52.880
In the end, they're just adventurers.

17:53.380 --> 17:55.150
They don't care about us.

17:56.930 --> 17:58.390
No, Isuzu!

17:58.390 --> 17:59.890
They aren't talking about you!

18:00.150 --> 18:01.060
Yeah.

18:01.620 --> 18:04.460
They're talking about those knights, aren't they?

18:05.090 --> 18:06.090
But...

18:08.300 --> 18:14.150
I understand why you wanted to get 
us out of here as soon as possible.

18:15.630 --> 18:20.910
I think a lot of people's lives were saved 
because the knights were here.

18:21.780 --> 18:26.570
But there are some people who feel betrayed 
because they got their hopes up.

18:27.430 --> 18:30.790
Yeah, we're also adventurers.

18:30.790 --> 18:33.180
We might be blamed for that.

18:34.590 --> 18:35.650
I'm sorry.

18:37.360 --> 18:40.280
It's not something you need to apologize for.

18:40.280 --> 18:45.380
And I'm really glad we came here.

18:45.380 --> 18:50.190
All the things that were bothering 
me seem so small now.

18:51.120 --> 18:54.540
So I wanted to do something for this town.

18:55.070 --> 18:57.450
I wanted to leave something for them.

18:58.090 --> 19:00.430
You gave them a forty-three..

19:00.870 --> 19:04.640
A new song that never existed in this world.

19:05.170 --> 19:09.460
That song... It's hope! Hope!

19:09.970 --> 19:11.960
Thank you, Rudy.

19:12.900 --> 19:15.590
But if it doesn't remain here, then...

19:29.490 --> 19:31.550
Our journey's over, isn't it?

19:31.550 --> 19:32.610
Yeah.

19:36.700 --> 19:38.070
Is something wrong?

19:39.610 --> 19:40.490
A song?

19:40.760 --> 19:41.690
A song?

19:41.690 --> 19:43.790
You're right! That song!

19:55.970 --> 19:57.710
Those kids...

19:57.710 --> 20:00.290
It's still here.

20:02.550 --> 20:05.260
You made a new song.

20:05.760 --> 20:11.270
And now, that song will become 
a new hope for those kids.

20:25.530 --> 20:29.200
They're singing Isuzu's song over there, too!

20:30.030 --> 20:33.580
This is as far as we were able to come, but...

20:34.230 --> 20:36.980
Yes, but this song...

20:37.700 --> 20:39.750
It'll go farther west.

20:39.750 --> 20:43.430
It will spread out around the whole world!

20:44.290 --> 20:50.470
<i>And it'll give everyone the 
most important thing: hope.</i>

21:07.530 --> 21:08.690
A griffon?

21:10.200 --> 21:11.240
Meow.

21:12.030 --> 21:13.390
Nyanta!

21:15.520 --> 21:16.560
Chief!

21:16.560 --> 21:17.710
Nyanta!

21:24.310 --> 21:27.720
<i>It'd been so long since we'd seen Akihabara.</i>

21:28.340 --> 21:33.180
<i>And the city and everyone's smiles 
seemed so bright, so hopeful.</i>

21:34.730 --> 21:38.010
<i>I felt my whole body relaxing.</i>

21:39.040 --> 21:42.740
<i>All the tension just disappeared...</i>

21:45.430 --> 21:47.940
Cheers!

21:52.830 --> 21:58.770
<i>Yes... We've always been protected 
here, by these people.</i>

21:59.700 --> 22:03.460
<i>I remembered that again.</i>

22:06.100 --> 22:13.980
<i>Afterward, everyone else and I fell asleep, 
though we don't remember when.</i>

22:14.510 --> 22:19.030
<i>But I remember Roe 2 appeared in my dreams.</i>

22:20.100 --> 22:23.690
<i>Even in my dream, she was a mystery.</i>

24:06.310 --> 24:11.380
Unknown monsters, the Geniuses, 
sneak into Akihabara to cause chaos.

24:11.380 --> 24:13.300
Who are they?

24:13.300 --> 24:17.230
The letter from Roe 2 holds 
the key to that mystery.

24:17.230 --> 24:20.760
There is still something in this world that 
Shiroe and the others know nothing of.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.770
The People of the Land, the adventurers, and...

24:23.770 --> 24:25.430
Next time: Stranger.

24:23.770 --> 24:29.940
<b>Stranger</b>

24:25.430 --> 24:27.260
I have friends to run with me.
