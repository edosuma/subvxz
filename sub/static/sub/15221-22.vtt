It's just-

15:51.550 --> 15:54.451
I really don't believe
that I was here to save her.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.188
Then why are you here?

15:58.257 --> 16:00.316

I think we should ask Ziggy.

Mmm. What?

16:12.304 --> 16:14.932
What is this?
This is all wrong.
What?

16:15.007 --> 16:17.805
It says you're here
to prove my innocence.

16:17.876 --> 16:20.743
What's wrong with that?
I never stood trial.

16:20.813 --> 16:26.080
See, Lisa told Commander, uh-
my defense attorney,
Commander What's-his-name-

16:26.151 --> 16:29.382
Dobbs.
Dobbs.
Hell of a nice guy.

16:29.455 --> 16:32.481
She told him that I was with her
on the night of the murder.

16:33.959 --> 16:38.089
And then when Lisa was... killed,

16:38.163 --> 16:42.259
he told her story to the navy
and convinced them to drop the charges.

16:42.334 --> 16:48.102
So, you didn't leap in to save me,
because Lisa already did it.

16:48.173 --> 16:50.107
God love her.
Oh, boy.

16:50.175 --> 16:54.509
"Oh, boy,'' what?
Uh, why don't you ask Ziggy...

16:54.580 --> 16:56.878
what the odds are that you're
gonna be court-martialed?

16:56.949 --> 16:59.543
I told you.
They never pressed charges.
Yeah, I know.

16:59.618 --> 17:01.813
Why don't you
just ask him though?

17:03.989 --> 17:06.617

And that you'll be convicted?

Uh, Al-

[ Sighs ]

17:16.801 --> 17:21.637
I changed history.
I thought I was here
to prove your innocence,

17:21.707 --> 17:24.073
so I told Lisa not to say anything
to Commander Dobbs,

17:24.143 --> 17:29.137
so she never told him
that she was your alibi.

17:29.214 --> 17:32.081
Oh.

17:32.151 --> 17:35.143
Well, I'm glad.
You mean, you're glad
I just blew your alibi?

Yeah, but there won't be anybody

Marci wasn't very subtle, sir.

Everybody knew about it.
I mean, even Commander Riker,

she had a lot of accidents.

have an affair with you?

19:13.352 --> 19:15.513
They weren't affairs, sir.
They were initiations.

19:17.089 --> 19:19.751
Unfortunately,
she never did it more than once.

19:21.527 --> 19:24.496
When did she initiate
Ensign Calavicci?

19:24.563 --> 19:28.863
She didn't. Bingo was involved
with Lisa when he joined us.

19:28.934 --> 19:31.334
So Ensign Calavicci
turned Mrs. Riker down?

19:33.005 --> 19:35.405
Yes, sir. And that really
got her heater itching.

19:35.474 --> 19:38.932
Like I said, sir,
she wasn't very subtle.

19:39.011 --> 19:42.913
But last Saturday night,
she really laid it out there.

She was all over Bingo.
Practically raped him

Of course you did, mister.
I watched you do it.

I watched her run from your car.

I watched you catch her,
tear her clothes off, rape her.

22:37.289 --> 22:40.258
You watched your wife being raped
and did nothing to stop it?

It was some kind of game,
wasn't it?

- Yell?
-" Hey, stop that!''

I object. Defense council
is badgering the witness.

requested clarification.
I simply gave it to him.

- Objection overruled.
- Did you yell?

- <i>You watched a man rape your wife...</i>

- Because she deserved it.

The U.S. Navy may not trust
a rowboat to Commander Riker
after his testimony,

for precisely that reason.

to convict me.

30:37.535 --> 30:39.469

If you didn't murder his wife-
and I believe you didn't-

30:43.141 --> 30:45.507
Commander Dirk Riker's lying.

30:46.845 --> 30:49.405
Maybe to save his own neck.

44:57.928 --> 45:00.863
Yeah, um, at least we leaped
him- uh, me-

45:00.931 --> 45:02.865
Bingo!
Uh, yeah, Bingo out.

45:02.933 --> 45:05.766
Now, where he landed-
When is more important.

45:05.836 --> 45:08.498
That too. Ziggy says there's
an 80% chance...

45:08.572 --> 45:11.973
that he landed here
before Marci got murdered.

45:12.042 --> 45:15.910
It's gonna work, Al,
as long as you- as long as Bingo
keeps Chip away from Marci.

45:15.979 --> 45:18.777
How- How is it gonna save Lisa?

45:18.849 --> 45:21.044
You told me that she was crying,
right?

45:21.118 --> 45:24.110
That Lisa was wiping her eyes
before she ran into the semi, right?

45:24.188 --> 45:26.281
Yeah.

45:26.356 --> 45:30.292
If Marci's not killed,
and you're not accused,
she has no reason to be crying.

45:30.360 --> 45:33.261
So that-
What?

45:34.264 --> 45:36.255
What?

45:37.401 --> 45:39.801
<i>Sam, what?</i>
He's gone.

45:39.870 --> 45:43.772
- Who's gone?
- He's gone. My shadow's gone.

45:43.841 --> 45:46.810
He's go- He-
Well, maybe he went to the head.

45:46.877 --> 45:48.868
He would sooner wet his pants
than leave that door.

45:48.946 --> 45:50.914
You did it, buddy!
You and Bingo did it!

45:50.981 --> 45:52.972
God, I hope you're right.

45:53.050 --> 45:57.919
<i>Yo, Bingo.! Hey, Bingo,</i>
<i>look who got off duty early.</i>

46:00.224 --> 46:02.818
Heya, sailor, you want to buy
a thirsty nurse a drink?

46:02.893 --> 46:04.884
Lisa.

46:17.374 --> 46:20.935
<i>[ Woman ]</i>
<i>Lee? Look. Smile.</i>

46:25.115 --> 46:27.049
<i>[ Sam ]</i>
<i>Oh, boy.</i>
