No! No...!

00:45.671 --> 00:47.455
Don't!

00:48.807 --> 00:51.459
Captain!

00:51.461 --> 00:53.061
Torres!

00:53.063 --> 00:54.962

01:33.269 --> 01:35.236
Ah, the sweet smell
of recycled air.

01:35.238 --> 01:37.489
The hot glare
of an annoying skylight.

01:37.491 --> 01:39.975
The weird whir
of broken fax machine.

01:39.977 --> 01:41.409
Another day in paradise.

01:41.411 --> 01:44.129
Well, somebody woke up
on the far side of the bed.

01:44.131 --> 01:46.915
Actually, I sort
of did, Ziva.

01:46.917 --> 01:48.500
Thanks to my annoying
new neighbors

01:48.502 --> 01:50.952
who kept me awake
until 5:00 this morning.

01:50.954 --> 01:51.886
The screamers?

01:51.888 --> 01:53.638
The screamers.

01:53.640 --> 01:55.757
Third night in a row.
ZIVA: I had neighbors

01:55.759 --> 01:57.792
once who never <i>stopped</i> fighting.

01:57.794 --> 01:59.627
Not that kind of screamer, Ziva.

01:59.629 --> 02:00.729
Hey.

02:00.731 --> 02:01.763
I don't know what happened,

02:01.765 --> 02:02.814
but I must have taken your bag

02:02.816 --> 02:04.298
last night when I left.
Do you have mine?

02:04.300 --> 02:06.300
Yeah.

02:06.302 --> 02:07.936
Thank you.

02:07.938 --> 02:10.304
Hey, you didn't snoop, did you?

02:10.306 --> 02:11.489
No, I didn't snoop.

02:11.491 --> 02:13.658
That's your department.

02:13.660 --> 02:16.528
My 1974 Instamatic.

02:16.530 --> 02:17.779
You're taking up photography?
No.

02:17.781 --> 02:19.948
No, but I loved it
when I was a kid.

02:19.950 --> 02:21.482
I took this camera
with me everywhere.

02:21.484 --> 02:24.318
And I found it in this box that
my dad gave me a while back.

02:24.320 --> 02:26.204
I'm hoping Abby can develop
whatever's on this film.

02:26.206 --> 02:27.956
You do not know?
No.

02:27.958 --> 02:31.259
Well, if it's anything like
your boarding school picture...

02:31.261 --> 02:32.493
What boarding school picture?

02:32.495 --> 02:34.629
You did snoop,
you little liar.

02:34.631 --> 02:36.664
Give it to me.
I don't know.

02:36.666 --> 02:39.634
I really think Ziva
should see it first. Ziva?

02:39.636 --> 02:41.720
(gasps)
Oh!

02:41.722 --> 02:43.504
Oh, oh, oh.

02:43.506 --> 02:45.690
Okay. Okay.
(Ziva laughs)

02:45.692 --> 02:48.360
(laughs)
Okay.

02:48.362 --> 02:49.394
Have your chuckles.

02:49.396 --> 02:50.612
By the way,

02:50.614 --> 02:53.281
that was a very good
look back in the day.

02:53.283 --> 02:54.399
For a Bible salesman.

02:54.401 --> 02:55.567
ZIVA:
Tony, if I were you,

02:55.569 --> 02:57.035
I would burn that film

02:57.037 --> 02:59.287
because you do not want any more
of these getting out there.

02:59.289 --> 03:00.705
It shouldn't have
gotten out at all,

03:00.707 --> 03:02.290
but it did
thanks to McSnoop Dogg here.

03:02.292 --> 03:04.492
Now, listen, give me the picture...
(elevator bell dings)

03:04.494 --> 03:05.860
...because Gibbs cannot
get his hands on this.

03:05.862 --> 03:07.045
Do you understand me?

03:07.047 --> 03:08.163
Nice look, helmet head.

03:08.165 --> 03:09.631
Hey, boss.

03:09.633 --> 03:11.032
It was a transitional phase.

03:11.034 --> 03:14.035
You know, the eighties.

03:14.037 --> 03:17.255
Sort of had a John Denver thing
going on, and, uh..

03:17.257 --> 03:21.142
Let's go.
Dead Marine downtown.

03:21.144 --> 03:23.544
Uh, boss,
can I have that back, please?

03:23.546 --> 03:25.313
(whispers):
See what you did?!

03:25.315 --> 03:27.949
Can I have that back, please?

03:27.951 --> 03:30.101
(train whistle blowing)

03:32.855 --> 03:34.639
(camera shutter clicking)

03:34.641 --> 03:37.158
McGEE:
Watch and wallet are still here.

03:37.160 --> 03:38.443
No signs of a robbery.

03:38.445 --> 03:39.744
Got an I.D.?

03:39.746 --> 03:42.614
Yeah. First Lieutenant
Michael Torres, 31.

03:42.616 --> 03:44.532
Originally from Ohio.

03:44.534 --> 03:46.668
Moved to D.C. after getting
engaged last year.

03:46.670 --> 03:48.569
Family?
Parents have been notified.

03:48.571 --> 03:50.905
Fiancée's out of town on a trip.
Get her back.

03:50.907 --> 03:53.091
It looks as though
he's been beaten, Jethro.

03:53.093 --> 03:54.843
Any weapon, Duck?

03:54.845 --> 03:56.010
Uh, wounds
are consistent

03:56.012 --> 03:58.296
with the good
old-fashioned human fist.

03:58.298 --> 03:59.580
Yeah, believe it or not,

03:59.582 --> 04:01.433
at one point in my life,
I dabbled in boxing.

04:01.435 --> 04:03.468
Well, I wasn't really
a boxer, per se.

04:03.470 --> 04:05.419
Uh, more of a, uh,

04:05.421 --> 04:06.604
an assistant.

04:06.606 --> 04:07.972
Uh...

04:07.974 --> 04:10.525
Uh... I was a bucket boy.

04:10.527 --> 04:11.776
Give me a T.O.D., Duck.

04:11.778 --> 04:13.778
DUCKY: Judging by the
lack of rigor

04:13.780 --> 04:18.116
and the coagulation, oh,
approximately 2:00 to 3:00 a.m.

04:18.118 --> 04:21.870
Oh, that is a nasty gash
to the back of his head.

04:21.872 --> 04:23.488
Deep laceration.

04:23.490 --> 04:25.273
Doctor, there's something
under his fingernails here.

04:25.275 --> 04:27.275
Looks like dirt.

04:27.277 --> 04:28.576
I have located just
one security camera.

04:28.578 --> 04:29.878
Belongs to the owner
of the building.

04:29.880 --> 04:30.795
The camera face the alley?

04:30.797 --> 04:32.446
He believes so,
but I will verify.

04:32.448 --> 04:33.614
TONY:
Hey, boss.

04:33.616 --> 04:34.916
Cops just got a call

04:34.918 --> 04:36.251
about someone breaking
into the victim's apartment.

04:36.253 --> 04:38.136
Witnesses described
a young white male

04:38.138 --> 04:40.805
with blood
on his clothes.

04:43.225 --> 04:45.426
(door squeaks open)

04:48.481 --> 04:50.682
(dog barking)

04:51.517 --> 04:53.685
(items clanking)

04:55.404 --> 04:58.490
NCIS. Turn around.

04:58.492 --> 04:59.440
Now!

05:01.277 --> 05:03.611
Captain Joe Westcott, Sir.

05:03.613 --> 05:05.646
Don't shoot. Don't shoot!

05:05.648 --> 05:07.031
You're coming with us, Captain.

05:07.033 --> 05:08.333
No, I can't. Can't. Those men--

05:08.335 --> 05:11.035
they took Lieutenant Torres,
and I have to get him back.

05:13.255 --> 05:14.989
No one has him.

05:16.625 --> 05:18.259
He's dead.

05:18.261 --> 05:20.428
(gasps)

05:33.357 --> 05:34.664
TONY: Guy seemed pretty
out of it, boss.

05:34.666 --> 05:37.033
Maybe he's still in shock.
Or guilty.

05:37.035 --> 05:38.051
Background.
By all accounts,

05:38.053 --> 05:39.702
Captain Joseph Westcott

05:39.704 --> 05:41.471
and Lieutenant Michael
Torres were close.

05:41.473 --> 05:43.306
Friends since childhood,
joined the Corps together.

05:43.308 --> 05:44.641
TONY:
Records are spotless.

05:44.643 --> 05:46.176
Both highly regarded
by their unit.

05:46.178 --> 05:47.260
C.O. called them
born leaders.

05:47.262 --> 05:48.928
Says they exemplify
the highest level

05:48.930 --> 05:50.230
of commitment to the Marines.

05:50.232 --> 05:51.648
Captain never called 911.

05:51.650 --> 05:53.433
Doesn't sound
like commitment to me.

05:53.435 --> 05:54.884
What else?

05:54.886 --> 05:57.187
Lieutenant Torres was finishing
his second tour in Afghanistan.

05:57.189 --> 05:59.022
And, uh, Captain
Westcott his third

05:59.024 --> 06:00.890
before his release

06:00.892 --> 06:02.942
for medical discharge
eight months ago.

06:02.944 --> 06:04.778
And yet he still uses the title.

06:04.780 --> 06:05.745
That's habit.

06:05.747 --> 06:06.780
ZIVA:
He lives in Ohio.

06:06.782 --> 06:07.997
Currently unemployed.

06:07.999 --> 06:10.333
Father is alive,
mother is deceased.

06:10.335 --> 06:12.369
One brother.
He's a Marine.

06:12.371 --> 06:14.454
What type of injury?
Nerve damage to his right leg

06:14.456 --> 06:16.423
after an ambush
on his unit

06:16.425 --> 06:18.341
last year
near Arghanda.

06:18.343 --> 06:20.026
Still gathering details,
but we do know

06:20.028 --> 06:22.045
that four Marines were killed.

06:22.047 --> 06:25.081
With Lieutenant Torres...

06:25.083 --> 06:28.101
that makes five.

06:34.058 --> 06:36.276
GIBBS:
So, what were you were doing

06:36.278 --> 06:38.144
in Lieutenant
Torres' apartment?

06:38.146 --> 06:39.429
Gathering supplies, sir.

06:39.431 --> 06:40.730
I had to find him.

06:40.732 --> 06:41.931
You saying he was
taken from the alley?

06:41.933 --> 06:43.066
'Cause that's where
he was found.

06:43.068 --> 06:45.201
They must've
dumped him back there.

06:45.203 --> 06:47.821
They?
There were five or six attackers.

06:47.823 --> 06:50.606
They came out of nowhere, sir.
Out of nowhere.

06:50.608 --> 06:52.909
Special Agent Gibbs.
Sorry.

06:52.911 --> 06:54.210
It's habit.

06:54.212 --> 06:56.129
Where'd you get these?

06:59.500 --> 07:01.418
Everything was just
happening so fast.

07:01.420 --> 07:03.420
We were running,
it was dark, and I kept

07:03.422 --> 07:05.972
yelling for Torres
to stay with me.

07:05.974 --> 07:08.425
Stay with me.
Don't... let them gain on us.

07:08.427 --> 07:10.626
And then, I...

07:13.431 --> 07:15.631
I lost him.

07:16.684 --> 07:19.152
Let's start
from the beginning, all right?

07:19.154 --> 07:21.271
Where were you?

07:22.773 --> 07:25.525
Last night...
when this happened.

07:25.527 --> 07:28.111
We finished dinner at
this Italian place,

07:28.113 --> 07:30.280
and we headed over
to a convenience store

07:30.282 --> 07:31.881
to get something to drink.

07:31.883 --> 07:33.450
And when we walked out,

07:33.452 --> 07:35.351
I felt these guys
right on our tail.

07:35.353 --> 07:36.953
Okay. What
time was that?

07:36.955 --> 07:38.421
Around 0200.
Okay. Then what?

07:38.423 --> 07:40.990
Well, then, next thing I know,
we're getting pounded.

07:40.992 --> 07:42.325
And I got hit hard.

07:42.327 --> 07:44.127
When I came to,

07:44.129 --> 07:45.879
I saw Torres being dragged away,

07:45.881 --> 07:47.831
and he was in bad shape.

07:47.833 --> 07:49.832
And I just...

07:49.834 --> 07:52.519
I wanted to help him.

07:56.340 --> 07:58.341
I ran.

07:58.343 --> 08:00.527
Uh...

08:01.779 --> 08:05.148
Did you get a good look
at the attackers?

08:05.150 --> 08:07.650
Uh... one.

08:07.652 --> 08:08.818
And I keep

08:08.820 --> 08:11.020
seeing his face
over and over in my head.

08:11.022 --> 08:12.622
Okay.

08:12.624 --> 08:14.657
I'll bring someone
in to do a sketch.

08:14.659 --> 08:16.359
You can give
details, right?

08:17.878 --> 08:20.196
Right? Captain?

08:21.031 --> 08:22.882
Do my best, sir.

08:26.387 --> 08:28.171
You serve, Agent Gibbs?

08:28.173 --> 08:30.473
Scout sniper.

08:32.058 --> 08:34.092
Then you know what it's like.

08:34.095 --> 08:36.179
Seeing your friends die,

08:36.181 --> 08:39.381
and thinking
you could've done more.

08:41.836 --> 08:43.937
He's haunted by
what he saw.

08:43.938 --> 08:45.655
I'm not at all surprised.

08:45.657 --> 08:49.192
Lieutenant Torres suffered quite
an attack before his death.

08:49.194 --> 08:50.527
Mr. Palmer?

08:50.529 --> 08:51.727
We counted ten wounds.

08:51.729 --> 08:53.496
Four in the arms and torso,

08:53.498 --> 08:55.114
three in the face,
three to the back.

08:55.116 --> 08:58.334
In other words, he was getting
punched from all directions.

08:58.336 --> 08:59.452
Multiple attackers.

08:59.454 --> 09:00.620
Well, it would appear so.

09:00.622 --> 09:03.006
And yet, we didn't find
any offensive wounds.

09:03.008 --> 09:05.091
His knuckles
are clear of bruising,

09:05.093 --> 09:07.877
and his hands have no fractures.

09:07.879 --> 09:10.096
Nothing to suggest
that he fought back.

09:10.098 --> 09:11.848
That's weird
for a seasoned combat vet.

09:11.850 --> 09:13.550
Cause of death?
Blunt force trauma.

09:13.552 --> 09:16.719
The impact almost
split his skull open.

09:16.721 --> 09:20.473
Oh, and there was a small amount
of gravel in the wound.

09:20.475 --> 09:22.425
That's his head
hitting concrete.

09:22.427 --> 09:24.060
We didn't find any fingerprints?

09:24.062 --> 09:26.729
And no word from Abby yet on the
substance under his fingernails.

09:26.731 --> 09:28.948
Yes, but I sent her
samples of blood

09:28.950 --> 09:30.933
from each of his wounds.

09:30.935 --> 09:32.535
These are her results.

09:32.537 --> 09:35.238
They all match the
lieutenant's except one.

09:35.240 --> 09:37.290
Doesn't match Westcott, either.

09:37.292 --> 09:39.492
Yeah, well, it means one thing.

09:39.494 --> 09:43.580
Find someone with a DNA match,
and you have your killer.

09:49.453 --> 09:50.637
McGee, give me something.

09:50.639 --> 09:51.971
Well, credit card records show

09:51.973 --> 09:54.173
that Lieutenant Torres
made purchases at

09:54.175 --> 09:56.426
Brusquelli's Restaurant
at 12:45 a.m.,

09:56.428 --> 09:59.629
then at Atlantic E-Z Mart
at 2:03.

09:59.631 --> 10:01.180
Right before his murder. Video?

10:01.182 --> 10:02.849
Store security cameras were down
for repair.

10:02.851 --> 10:04.767
Tony and Ziva talked
to the manager.

10:04.769 --> 10:06.019
They're on their way back.

10:06.021 --> 10:07.737
Got footage from the alley?
Hasn't been easy.

10:07.739 --> 10:09.072
It's off an
old VHS tape.

10:09.074 --> 10:10.473
Trying to work
with this stuff

10:10.475 --> 10:13.860
is like trying to ride
a dinosaur on the freeway.

10:14.645 --> 10:16.446
Not your concern.
I'll put it up.

10:17.498 --> 10:19.699
(computer trilling)

10:21.368 --> 10:22.619
What am I looking at?

10:22.621 --> 10:24.087
Those shadows
you see may be duplicates,

10:24.089 --> 10:25.038
or ghost images.

10:25.040 --> 10:26.005
It's what happens

10:26.007 --> 10:27.206
when the same tape
gets recorded

10:27.208 --> 10:28.458
over without being erased.

10:28.460 --> 10:29.342
Meaning?
Meaning,

10:29.344 --> 10:30.510
some of the people

10:30.512 --> 10:31.878
you see were there last night,

10:31.880 --> 10:33.346
some maybe... six months ago.

10:33.348 --> 10:36.832
Even worse, alley's right next
to a train station.

10:36.834 --> 10:38.668
Gets a ton
of foot traffic.

10:38.670 --> 10:40.436
GIBBS:
Any of these Lieutenant Torres?

10:40.438 --> 10:42.305
Well, after matching
the time code on the tape

10:42.307 --> 10:43.640
to the time
of the murder,

10:43.642 --> 10:46.008
I was able to isolate
what I believe is him.

10:46.677 --> 10:48.144
(computer chirps)

10:48.146 --> 10:50.113
There. Right next to him.

10:50.115 --> 10:52.565
Looks like Captain Westcott's
height and build.

10:52.567 --> 10:54.417
Keep going.
I.D. the attackers.

10:54.419 --> 10:57.236
We already did.
Name is Sam Mathis.

10:57.238 --> 10:59.188
Put it up.

11:03.877 --> 11:05.161
(chuckles)

11:07.864 --> 11:09.532
Manager reported
he was at the store

11:09.534 --> 11:11.167
last night
hassling customers.

11:11.169 --> 11:12.752
Said he was looking
to start a fight.

11:12.754 --> 11:13.869
Guy's got a record, boss.

11:13.871 --> 11:15.871
Assault charges
dating back to 2000.

11:15.873 --> 11:19.008
Hey, you recognize him?

11:19.010 --> 11:20.259
JOE:
Maybe, not sure,

11:20.261 --> 11:22.011
uh, but this guy--

11:22.013 --> 11:23.763
he was there, no doubt.
Ziva,

11:23.765 --> 11:25.715
start a BOLO on this.

11:25.717 --> 11:27.383
DiNozzo, you find Mathis.

11:27.385 --> 11:28.818
McGee...
McGEE: I'll keep working the video.

11:28.820 --> 11:29.769
Get Abby to help.

11:29.771 --> 11:31.237
You are still a witness
in this case.

11:31.239 --> 11:32.905
Stay close for a few days.

11:32.907 --> 11:33.940
I'm here to help, Agent Gibbs.

11:33.942 --> 11:35.575
I just want to find
whoever did this.

11:37.411 --> 11:41.330
I don't understand how this
could happen, Agent Gibbs.

11:41.332 --> 11:43.282
Michael was home.

11:43.284 --> 11:45.118
Home's supposed
to be safe.

11:45.120 --> 11:47.537
Your fiancé have
any enemies,

11:47.539 --> 11:49.088
anybody that'd
want to hurt him?

11:49.090 --> 11:50.256
No.

11:50.258 --> 11:51.741
The only enemies
he worried about

11:51.743 --> 11:53.576
were the ones
in Afghanistan.

11:53.578 --> 11:55.094
When'd you last talk?
Last night,

11:55.096 --> 11:58.181
uh, um, 9:30.

11:58.183 --> 12:00.433
Did he seem upset or
did he seem agitated?

12:00.435 --> 12:03.419
No, no, he was fine,

12:03.421 --> 12:06.723
excited that The General
was in town visiting.

12:09.593 --> 12:11.561
Who is, uh, The General?

12:11.563 --> 12:14.930
That's what all the guys in
the unit called Joe Westcott.

12:14.932 --> 12:16.916
They worshipped him.

12:16.918 --> 12:18.618
He was their rock.

12:20.320 --> 12:23.806
And lately, um,
he had Michael worried.

12:23.808 --> 12:25.575
Why?

12:27.594 --> 12:31.581
After he was discharged,
he kind of withdrew.

12:31.583 --> 12:35.117
Michael thought that he was
too isolated in Ohio.

12:35.119 --> 12:37.953
Kept telling him
to come visit.

12:37.955 --> 12:42.792
That's the only thing
giving me comfort right now...

12:42.794 --> 12:46.345
just knowing that Joe was
with Michael when he died.

12:52.853 --> 12:54.270
(Ziva laughs)

12:54.272 --> 12:55.438
No need to
explain, Tony.

12:55.440 --> 12:58.324
Everyone goes through
a, an awkward stage.

12:58.326 --> 12:59.776
(scoffs)
Granted,

12:59.778 --> 13:02.161
it may have been
a little awkward,

13:02.163 --> 13:04.914
but take a look at me
now-- not very awkward.

13:04.916 --> 13:06.582
Well, I think,
underneath that nice suit

13:06.584 --> 13:08.084
and that charming smile,

13:08.086 --> 13:11.687
you are still
a very homely little boy.

13:11.689 --> 13:13.956
Homely little boy?

13:13.958 --> 13:14.841
(scoffs)

13:14.843 --> 13:16.008
I was an adorable
little boy

13:16.010 --> 13:17.293
and when I get those
pictures developed,

13:17.295 --> 13:20.630
your world will be
rocked, Ms. David.

13:20.632 --> 13:21.997
Well, I'm looking
forward to it.

13:21.999 --> 13:23.165
(knocking)

13:24.351 --> 13:26.219
Sam Mathis.

13:26.221 --> 13:28.137
NCIS.

13:28.139 --> 13:31.808
(Spanish hip hop playing)

13:31.810 --> 13:32.975
NCI who?

13:32.977 --> 13:34.343
You need
to come

13:34.345 --> 13:35.027
with us.

13:35.029 --> 13:37.697
(grunting)

13:42.369 --> 13:44.787
How's that for homely?

13:55.215 --> 13:56.364
(chuckling)

13:56.366 --> 13:57.532
Ha.

13:57.534 --> 13:59.589
Yeah, it's a real
laugh riot, huh?

13:59.591 --> 14:00.874
Well, keep it up,

14:00.876 --> 14:03.086
smart-ass, and I'll put you
right back in cuffs.

14:03.087 --> 14:05.388
Would you
like that?

14:05.390 --> 14:07.857
It's all fun and games
until somebody gets hurt

14:07.859 --> 14:09.976
or, in Lieutenant
Torres' case,

14:09.978 --> 14:11.927
killed.

14:13.731 --> 14:16.149
Why don't we take a look
at what you did?

14:16.984 --> 14:18.768
Hey.

14:18.770 --> 14:20.820
I told you I don't know
nothing about no murder.

14:20.822 --> 14:22.038
No, of course not,

14:22.040 --> 14:25.658
and I bet those cuts got there
all by themselves.

14:25.660 --> 14:27.243
It's not what
it looks like, man.

14:27.245 --> 14:28.944
Hey, I've got an idea.

14:28.946 --> 14:30.330
Let's look at your record.

14:30.332 --> 14:31.664
I've done some stuff.

14:31.666 --> 14:32.715
So what?

14:32.717 --> 14:35.385
That don't make me
no killer.

14:35.387 --> 14:37.804
We know you were in the
Atlantic E-Z Mart last night

14:37.806 --> 14:38.838
looking for a fight.

14:38.840 --> 14:40.556
I was just messing around.
Messing around?

14:40.558 --> 14:43.125
Well, let's see,
if, by "messing around,"

14:43.127 --> 14:46.929
you mean, uh, getting up
in people's faces,

14:46.931 --> 14:48.348
then, I guess

14:48.350 --> 14:49.482
you are correct.

14:49.484 --> 14:51.434
Did you get up
in Lieutenant Torres' face?

14:51.436 --> 14:53.403
Maybe, I don't know.

14:53.405 --> 14:54.771
I think you did

14:54.773 --> 14:56.773
and I think you followed him out
of the store, down the street,

14:56.775 --> 14:58.241
and I think you jumped him.

14:58.243 --> 14:59.325
Okay.

14:59.327 --> 15:02.445
Yeah, I left right after
that guy and his friend,

15:02.447 --> 15:04.447
but I didn't follow them.

15:04.449 --> 15:05.999
Had someplace else to be.

15:06.001 --> 15:07.000
Really?

15:07.002 --> 15:08.150
Hot date?

15:08.152 --> 15:09.985
I don't want to say,
all right?

15:09.987 --> 15:11.871
My old lady would kill me
if she knew.

15:11.873 --> 15:13.051
Where do you think
I got these from?

15:13.052 --> 15:15.503
Hey, you don't have an
alibi, so the next time

15:16.378 --> 15:18.878
you see your old lady,
it's going to be in court.

15:19.763 --> 15:22.548
I was at High Points, okay?

15:22.550 --> 15:24.384
I was at High Points
all night.

15:24.386 --> 15:26.185
The strip club
over on Third?

15:26.187 --> 15:27.854
Yeah.

15:28.889 --> 15:30.673
You know the place?

15:33.394 --> 15:35.311
Okay.

15:35.313 --> 15:36.846
Great, Misty,

15:36.848 --> 15:38.031
all right,
all right, all right.

15:38.033 --> 15:39.115
Yes.

15:39.117 --> 15:40.683
(laughing):
That is all I need to know.

15:40.685 --> 15:42.235
I can't thank you
enough.

15:42.237 --> 15:44.120
You have always been
so helpful,

15:44.122 --> 15:46.039
and I mean that
in the most professional way.

15:46.041 --> 15:47.189
No, I'm not going

15:47.191 --> 15:48.374
to play "Misty" for you.

15:48.376 --> 15:49.692
(laughing):
All right.

15:49.694 --> 15:50.660
I got to run.

15:50.662 --> 15:51.744
Yeah, take care
of yourself, bye.

15:51.746 --> 15:52.795
(hangs up phone)

15:52.797 --> 15:55.298
Get your mind
out of the gutter, David.

15:55.300 --> 15:56.382
I'm a professional

15:56.384 --> 15:59.552
and Misty is a very nice girl.

15:59.554 --> 16:00.837
am sure she is.

16:00.839 --> 16:02.338
Give me the latest.
Club owner confirmed

16:02.340 --> 16:04.674
Mathis arrived at 2:00 a.m.,
left just after 6:00.

16:04.676 --> 16:05.725
Faxing over
receipts now.

16:05.727 --> 16:07.060
And Abby ran a test
on his blood.

16:07.062 --> 16:09.679
It does not match
the sample we found.

16:09.681 --> 16:11.514
Not our killer.
BOLO.

16:11.516 --> 16:12.765
Nothing yet.

16:12.767 --> 16:14.851
Local and state authorities
are still on alert.

16:14.853 --> 16:16.519
Go back over
Lieutenant Torres' record,

16:16.521 --> 16:18.354
interview marines
he served with.

16:18.356 --> 16:20.323
What about Captain Westcott?

16:20.325 --> 16:21.290
Yeah, what about him?

16:21.292 --> 16:23.409
Shouldn't we talk to him again,

16:23.411 --> 16:25.495
see if he's forgetting
something?

16:25.497 --> 16:29.732
No, he's given us enough.

16:33.337 --> 16:35.538
What, DiNozzo?

16:36.757 --> 16:37.957
Well, he was
the last one

16:37.959 --> 16:39.041
to see Lieutenant Torres alive

16:39.043 --> 16:40.710
and he had bruises
all over his hands.

16:40.712 --> 16:41.761
Ducky never found

16:41.763 --> 16:44.046
any physical evidence
tying him to the murder.

16:44.048 --> 16:45.765
I still think
that warrants a second look.

16:45.767 --> 16:47.750
And I don't.
(phone rings)

16:47.752 --> 16:49.585
Special Agent David.

16:49.587 --> 16:51.971
I will let him know.

16:51.973 --> 16:53.523
Gibbs, there is

16:53.525 --> 16:55.775
a visitor downstairs
for Captain Westcott.

16:55.777 --> 16:56.926
Who?

16:56.928 --> 16:59.112
(elevator bell dings)

17:00.731 --> 17:02.698
Agent Gibbs.

17:02.700 --> 17:04.483
Sergeant Westcott.
Good to meet you.

17:04.486 --> 17:05.484
Your brother know
you're here?

17:05.487 --> 17:07.737
I hope so, sir,
he called me.

17:07.739 --> 17:08.788
Said you were
on a seven-month tour,

17:08.790 --> 17:10.790
not back till Christmas.
No, sir,

17:10.791 --> 17:12.625
on leave till Christmas.

17:12.627 --> 17:14.877
He must have got
them mixed up.

17:14.878 --> 17:17.780
Understandable, considering.
Your father coming, too?

17:18.832 --> 17:20.782
Uh, no, no.

17:20.785 --> 17:22.251
Soon, though,
he just had

17:22.252 --> 17:24.118
to take care of a few
work things back home.

17:24.121 --> 17:25.838
Probably for
the best.

17:25.839 --> 17:27.006
Why is that?

17:27.840 --> 17:30.259
Where can I find
my brother, sir?

17:31.929 --> 17:33.930
He's at the Adler Hotel
downtown.

17:33.932 --> 17:35.932
Can take you
if you'll wait a minute.

17:35.934 --> 17:37.233
You know, I'd rather not.

17:37.235 --> 17:39.769
I'd like to see him
as soon as I can.

17:39.771 --> 17:42.304
Okay, understood.
(elevator bell dings)

17:44.191 --> 17:45.474
Family first.

17:45.476 --> 17:47.693
Always, sir.

17:47.695 --> 17:49.912
(elevator bell dings)

17:55.202 --> 17:57.370
Gibbs, Gibbs, don't go,
don't go that way.

17:57.372 --> 17:58.955
No, don't go that way.

17:58.957 --> 18:01.156
Abbs, where?

18:01.158 --> 18:02.675
This way,

18:02.677 --> 18:04.010
this way.

18:04.012 --> 18:05.011
McGEE:
Try spending

18:05.013 --> 18:06.379
the day with her.
Oh, you love it

18:06.381 --> 18:07.847
and you know it.

18:08.682 --> 18:10.883
So, based on the
evidence from the scene,

18:10.885 --> 18:12.685
I was able to recreate
all the blows

18:12.687 --> 18:14.437
to Lieutenant Torres' body.

18:14.439 --> 18:15.605
There were
ten blows in total

18:15.607 --> 18:19.008
to the arms, torso,
back, and face.

18:19.010 --> 18:21.510
So it looks like he
was surrounded, right?

18:21.512 --> 18:24.447
But, look, if he had
been surrounded,

18:24.449 --> 18:27.233
each wound would have
a distinct impression because

18:27.235 --> 18:28.901
each attacker would
have been standing

18:28.903 --> 18:30.036
in a totally
different place

18:30.038 --> 18:32.187
and striking from a
totally different angle.

18:32.189 --> 18:33.689
Now, based on
my measurements,

18:33.691 --> 18:36.859
I only found two types
of impressions--

18:36.861 --> 18:39.879
striking from the front
and the back.

18:39.881 --> 18:42.164
Two attackers.

18:42.166 --> 18:44.000
McGee, you find anything
from the video?

18:44.002 --> 18:46.719
McGEE: No, I'm working on it,
but still no faces.

18:46.721 --> 18:48.921
This tape is, like,
a million years old.

18:48.923 --> 18:50.506
It's giving me all
kinds of problems.

18:50.508 --> 18:51.674
It's like riding a...
Dinosaur.

18:51.676 --> 18:52.842
Freeway.
Got it.

18:52.844 --> 18:55.761
Yeah.
Yeah, but faces or no faces, Gibbs,

18:55.763 --> 18:57.396
our findings
do not match up

18:57.398 --> 18:58.731
with Captain Westcott's story.

18:58.733 --> 19:01.717
I mean, there's no way there
were multiple attackers.

19:01.719 --> 19:02.818
Think he's lying?

19:02.820 --> 19:05.571
Time to find out.

19:07.357 --> 19:08.858
(elevator bell dings)

19:08.860 --> 19:10.576
He won't open the door,
Agent Gibbs.

19:10.578 --> 19:12.028
He say anything?

19:12.030 --> 19:13.913
Uh, he told me
to go back to Ohio,

19:13.915 --> 19:17.199
he doesn't need anyone,
he's fine.

19:17.201 --> 19:19.085
It's just like him,
you know,

19:19.087 --> 19:21.087
taking everything on himself.

19:23.924 --> 19:25.958
Captain Westcott.
Special Agent Gibbs.

19:25.960 --> 19:26.926
Open the door.

19:26.928 --> 19:28.744
(knocks)
Westcott!

19:28.746 --> 19:29.912
(door opens)

19:31.598 --> 19:32.798
Well, hey,

19:32.800 --> 19:34.917
look who's here.
Oh,

19:34.919 --> 19:36.102
five minutes ago you
wouldn't answer the door,

19:36.104 --> 19:37.270
now you're
the funny guy.

19:37.272 --> 19:38.387
(scoffs)
Let's talk, Captain.

19:38.389 --> 19:39.755
Well, I'm kind of
in the middle

19:39.757 --> 19:41.607
of something right now,
Agent Gibbs, can it wait?

19:41.609 --> 19:44.226
No, no, it can't wait.

19:46.947 --> 19:48.764
(chuckles)

19:51.101 --> 19:53.286
No.

19:54.437 --> 19:56.122
He's coming, too.

19:56.124 --> 19:57.606
(chuckles)

20:09.169 --> 20:10.419
What, you smoking now, Joe?

20:10.421 --> 20:11.420
JOE:
Yeah.

20:11.422 --> 20:12.788
Why are you even
here anyway?

20:12.790 --> 20:14.423
You called me, remember?

20:14.425 --> 20:15.558
Yeah, I remember.
I'm just

20:15.560 --> 20:16.559
messing with you,
little brother,

20:16.561 --> 20:17.977
just messing
with you.

20:17.979 --> 20:19.812
That mean something, Captain?

20:19.814 --> 20:23.099
You know,
I've been brainstorming all day

20:23.101 --> 20:24.734
about everything that happened,
and I think if we went

20:24.736 --> 20:26.652
back to the convenience
store and we did a little...

20:26.654 --> 20:28.470
We found some inconsistencies.

20:29.439 --> 20:31.140
Yeah?
Okay, well,

20:31.142 --> 20:32.575
let's talk it out,
let's talk it out.

20:32.577 --> 20:34.493
Maybe I can help you piece
some things together and...

20:34.495 --> 20:35.778
I meant with your story.

20:38.448 --> 20:40.449
What are you saying,
Agent Gibbs?

20:40.451 --> 20:42.484
Evidence says two attackers.
No, that's wrong,

20:42.486 --> 20:44.319
all right, I told you that
there were five or six.

20:44.321 --> 20:46.038
Yeah, I'm telling you
that's not possible.

20:46.040 --> 20:47.322
Think I'm lying?

20:49.009 --> 20:50.676
Like I don't know what I saw?

20:50.678 --> 20:51.844
I'm not crazy.

20:51.846 --> 20:53.012
I didn't say that.

20:53.014 --> 20:55.164
A man's dead
and I'll find the truth.

20:55.166 --> 20:56.098
Yeah,

20:56.100 --> 20:57.600
what, and I
don't want to?

20:57.602 --> 20:59.451
Talking about my best friend
here, Agent Gibbs.

20:59.476 --> 21:00.547
Hey,
wait a minute, take it easy.

21:00.548 --> 21:01.949
Nobody wants to find
the truth more than me.

21:01.950 --> 21:04.150
Joe, come on, that's not what...
Shut up, Evan, you stay out of it.

21:04.475 --> 21:05.891
Now, I know
what I saw.

21:05.893 --> 21:07.777
We were attacked and
my friends are dead.

21:07.779 --> 21:09.011
Your friends?
You

21:09.013 --> 21:10.279
should be out there
looking for the killers...

21:10.281 --> 21:11.313
I got a job to do.
...instead of standing here

21:11.315 --> 21:12.982
questioning me!
You got a job to do?!

21:12.984 --> 21:14.316
Well, do it somewhere else!

21:14.318 --> 21:15.317
Joe.
Get out!

21:16.069 --> 21:17.486
Joe, what
the hell are you doing?

21:17.488 --> 21:19.354
Get out now.
Now!

21:23.526 --> 21:26.212
(door opens)

21:28.165 --> 21:31.584
I know what I saw!

21:34.221 --> 21:36.422
I know what I saw.

21:46.841 --> 21:48.674
Joe's never
lost it like that.

21:48.676 --> 21:51.727
He never even
raises his voice.

21:51.729 --> 21:53.846
I need to go back.
Try and reason with him.

21:53.848 --> 21:55.430
He won't listen.

21:55.432 --> 21:57.048
Not now.

21:57.050 --> 21:59.618
Just give him time.
He's not going anywhere.

21:59.620 --> 22:00.769
With all due respect,

22:00.771 --> 22:02.521
I think I know him
a little better than you do.

22:02.523 --> 22:03.689
He's confused.

22:04.491 --> 22:06.358
You saw that, right?
He's in pain.

22:06.360 --> 22:07.693
His best friend is dead.

22:07.695 --> 22:09.661
This isn't just
about Lieutenant Torres.

22:11.030 --> 22:12.397
There's something else going on.

22:12.399 --> 22:14.249
All right, I know
what you're thinking,

22:14.251 --> 22:15.400
but you're wrong.

22:15.402 --> 22:17.953
My brother's fine,
Agent Gibbs.

22:17.955 --> 22:20.422
He's fine.

22:30.016 --> 22:32.267
Looking for answers?

22:32.269 --> 22:35.470
'Cause I can assure you
Lieutenant Torres

22:35.472 --> 22:38.357
stopped talking a long time ago.

22:38.359 --> 22:40.359
So has Captain Westcott.
I take it

22:40.361 --> 22:42.477
your conversation
did not go well.

22:42.479 --> 22:45.013
He's in trouble, Duck.
He's struggling with the truth.

22:45.015 --> 22:48.066
And you think you're the one
to help him find it?

22:48.068 --> 22:49.651
I don't know. Maybe.

22:49.653 --> 22:53.322
Oscar Wilde said,
"Man is least himself

22:53.324 --> 22:56.325
"when he talks
in his own person.

22:56.327 --> 23:00.278
But give him a mask,
and he will tell you the truth""

23:00.280 --> 23:04.750
I suspect that you know
all too well

23:04.752 --> 23:08.053
the mask that the captain
is wearing.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.622
Not about me.

23:10.624 --> 23:12.140
No, it's not.

23:12.142 --> 23:14.593
But perhaps
your own past struggles

23:14.595 --> 23:19.064
can help you to unlock
what the captain is hiding.

23:19.066 --> 23:20.682
He's shut down, Duck.

23:20.684 --> 23:21.984
So is his brother.

23:21.986 --> 23:24.519
Well, denial is
a very powerful thing.

23:24.521 --> 23:26.655
Well, then we got
to break through.

23:26.657 --> 23:28.991
It's the only way
we're gonna find

23:28.993 --> 23:30.409
the lieutenant's killer.

23:30.411 --> 23:31.360
He, uh,

23:31.362 --> 23:33.946
seemed obsessed with this.

23:33.948 --> 23:36.198
Any idea what it means?

23:37.483 --> 23:39.484
Might have something to do
with an ambush last year.

23:39.486 --> 23:41.703
He keeps talking about friends he lost.
Well, it's not

23:41.705 --> 23:46.008
unusual for one trauma to evoke
strong memories of another.

23:46.010 --> 23:47.793
Well, that's what
I'm worried about.

23:47.795 --> 23:49.127
Well, worry tomorrow.

23:49.129 --> 23:51.597
It's late,
Jethro. Go home.

23:51.599 --> 23:54.132
Get some sleep.

23:54.134 --> 23:56.051
I'll see you
in the morning.

24:03.342 --> 24:06.278
Hey, Boss. Early bird
gets the worm?

24:06.280 --> 24:08.447
Figure this out?

24:11.401 --> 24:13.068
I-J-I?

24:13.070 --> 24:14.486
Iji.

24:14.488 --> 24:16.405
Actually, you know, I got a text
once from an ex-girlfriend

24:16.407 --> 24:17.489
that said...
DiNozzo.

24:17.491 --> 24:18.907
Sorry.

24:18.909 --> 24:20.525
What do you think?

24:20.527 --> 24:22.377
Looks like an acronym.
Or a name.

24:22.379 --> 24:24.046
It means something
to Captain Westcott.

24:24.048 --> 24:25.697
Find out why.
TONY: We're giving him a second

24:25.699 --> 24:26.665
look, after all?

24:26.667 --> 24:28.533
We are covering all bases.

24:28.535 --> 24:30.168
Starting now.

24:30.170 --> 24:31.837
You have any other questions?

24:31.839 --> 24:33.972
(phone ringing)
Nope. I'm good.

24:33.974 --> 24:35.841
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

24:35.843 --> 24:38.260
Yeah, Abbs.
I'm on my way.

24:38.262 --> 24:39.845
Revisit the
Arghanda ambush.

24:39.847 --> 24:41.096
Dig deeper.

24:41.098 --> 24:43.381
We are still awaiting
the official military report.

24:43.383 --> 24:44.816
Talk to State. DoD.

24:44.818 --> 24:47.686
I want answers. Everything. Now.

24:50.740 --> 24:52.937
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but isn't he...

24:52.962 --> 24:53.743
Yeah.

24:53.744 --> 24:55.410
He's still wearing
the same clothing

24:55.412 --> 24:56.528
he was wearing yesterday.

24:56.530 --> 24:57.729
Noticed that, too.

24:57.731 --> 24:59.781
I think he's getting
too close to this case.

24:59.783 --> 25:01.950
Too close to Westcott, for sure.

25:01.952 --> 25:04.369
Gibbs only gets too close when
he sees something we do not.

25:04.371 --> 25:06.571
Wonder what he's seeing
this time.

25:08.841 --> 25:10.008
Oh, good, there you are.

25:10.010 --> 25:11.593
Things are getting
much clearer.

25:11.595 --> 25:13.578
We finally ID'd
the attacker's face.

25:13.580 --> 25:15.347
"Face"? You said
there were two.

25:15.349 --> 25:17.799
Ugh. Gibbs, that
was so yesterday.

25:17.801 --> 25:19.351
After a very
long night, and

25:19.353 --> 25:21.803
more Caf-POW!s than the
recommended daily allowance,

25:21.805 --> 25:24.056
we were able to isolate
the last moments

25:24.058 --> 25:25.607
before Lieutenant
Torres' murder.

25:25.609 --> 25:27.976
By stripping down and
reassembling the tape,

25:27.978 --> 25:29.594
I was able to get
a much clearer picture

25:29.596 --> 25:32.531
of just who was in the alley
and who wasn't.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.203
Go closer.

25:40.439 --> 25:42.524
That's the same guy
in Westcott's sketch.

25:42.526 --> 25:44.159
ABBY: Right down to the beady
little eyes.

25:44.161 --> 25:45.711
I got a hit on
facial recognition,

25:45.713 --> 25:48.380
and then McGee found him in
the state police database.

25:48.382 --> 25:49.581
McGEE:
Randall Kersey,

25:49.583 --> 25:50.832
25 years old.

25:50.834 --> 25:53.668
Cited for jaywalking
last month. He works for

25:53.670 --> 25:55.721
Bilson Phone Company
here in DC.

25:55.723 --> 25:57.139
What's his connection to Torres?

25:57.141 --> 25:58.223
McGEE:
None that I can find.

25:58.225 --> 25:59.508
No military
background either,

25:59.510 --> 26:01.309
but I did find
something else.

26:05.014 --> 26:07.349
They followed
<i>him,</i> Boss.

26:09.836 --> 26:12.303
There's more.

26:12.305 --> 26:14.239
So, you know those
mystery particles

26:14.241 --> 26:16.324
we found underneath Lieutenant
Torres' fingernails?

26:16.326 --> 26:17.743
It wasn't dirt.

26:17.745 --> 26:20.362
They're tiny pieces
of mammalian flesh.

26:20.364 --> 26:22.364
And not the human kind.

26:22.366 --> 26:23.815
It's bovine.

26:23.817 --> 26:25.117
Like a cow.

26:25.119 --> 26:26.535
Or a... buffalo.

26:26.537 --> 26:28.587
Or... Who knows? Mm.
The important thing is

26:28.589 --> 26:31.339
it tested positive
for the lipase enzyme

26:31.341 --> 26:33.542
that's used to
process leather.

26:33.544 --> 26:35.293
On Captain Westcott's jacket.

26:35.295 --> 26:38.163
ABBY: If Lieutenant Torres had that
much under his nails,

26:38.165 --> 26:40.799
he must've really been
holding on to the captain.

26:40.801 --> 26:43.668
Or holding him back.

26:43.670 --> 26:46.004
I was afraid
for my life.

26:46.006 --> 26:49.357
You're sure these are the
two men who came after you?

26:51.027 --> 26:52.477
Yeah, him.

26:52.479 --> 26:53.645
Not the other one.

26:53.647 --> 26:56.698
GIBBS: Well, "the other one"
has a name.

26:56.700 --> 26:58.950
That's Lieutenant Torres.

26:58.952 --> 27:00.685
And he's dead.

27:02.972 --> 27:04.890
(sighs)

27:04.892 --> 27:06.124
It was an accident.

27:06.126 --> 27:08.210
I didn't mean to hurt him.
What happened?

27:08.212 --> 27:10.579
They followed me out
of a convenience store

27:10.581 --> 27:11.997
on Third.

27:11.999 --> 27:14.382
And... this guy

27:14.384 --> 27:15.967
here.

27:15.969 --> 27:17.586
He... was yelling.

27:17.588 --> 27:20.371
H-He was saying stuff
that didn't even make any sense.

27:20.373 --> 27:22.874
I tried to get away,
and he chased me down.

27:22.876 --> 27:24.542
And then I asked him
what he wanted,

27:24.544 --> 27:27.229
and then... he just lost it.

27:27.231 --> 27:29.547
He just started
throwing punches.

27:30.349 --> 27:31.566
You punched back.
I mean,

27:31.568 --> 27:33.902
the guy was out of his mind, okay?
Yeah.

27:33.904 --> 27:35.553
Where was Lieutenant Torres?

27:35.555 --> 27:36.571
He was... holding on to him.

27:36.573 --> 27:38.106
He was trying
to get him to stop.

27:38.108 --> 27:39.491
And then he got
in-between us,

27:39.493 --> 27:41.526
a-and the t... the tall guy...

27:41.528 --> 27:42.694
Captain Westcott.
Yeah.

27:42.696 --> 27:44.779
He just kept swinging,
so I did, too.

27:44.781 --> 27:47.532
And his friend, h-he was
still in-between us,

27:47.534 --> 27:49.284
so he was getting hit
a bunch of times.

27:49.286 --> 27:51.620
I mean, i-it was...
it was total chaos.

27:52.455 --> 27:55.123
And then finally
I-I pushed

27:55.125 --> 27:58.009
as hard as I could
to get away...

27:58.845 --> 28:01.079
...and then that's...

28:01.081 --> 28:02.597
(sighs)

28:03.549 --> 28:05.517
That's when Lieutenant Torres
went down.

28:05.519 --> 28:07.435
Yeah, he was...

28:07.437 --> 28:10.555
he was just lying there
on the ground.

28:10.557 --> 28:12.858
And he must've

28:12.860 --> 28:15.610
hit his head or something 'cause
there was blood everywhere.

28:15.612 --> 28:16.862
Did you go for help?

28:16.864 --> 28:18.480
No.

28:19.448 --> 28:20.649
I panicked, okay?

28:20.651 --> 28:22.117
I just wanted
to get out of there.

28:22.119 --> 28:24.035
I wanted to go somewhere safe.

28:24.037 --> 28:26.955
You could be brought up on
involuntary manslaughter.

28:26.957 --> 28:29.491
No. No, no, no.
No way.

28:29.493 --> 28:31.042
I'm gonna get a lawyer.

28:31.044 --> 28:33.111
I know this is self-defense.

28:34.547 --> 28:36.581
This guy here. He was crazy.

28:36.583 --> 28:39.301
Okay, Agent Gibbs?

28:39.303 --> 28:41.136
He came after <i>me.</i>

28:43.956 --> 28:46.291
I still cannot reach him.

28:46.293 --> 28:47.475
What about his brother?
He has not seen

28:47.477 --> 28:49.728
or spoken to Captain Westcott
since last night.

28:49.730 --> 28:51.296
Not returning any
of his calls, either.

28:51.298 --> 28:52.430
Hotel?
Front desk

28:52.432 --> 28:53.682
said he left early this morning.

28:53.684 --> 28:55.183
Belongings are still
in his room.

28:55.185 --> 28:56.434
Gibbs, you don't think

28:56.436 --> 28:57.736
he would do anything crazy...
McGee.

28:57.738 --> 28:58.853
Phone.

28:58.855 --> 29:01.990
Pulling up the cell grid now.
No hits.

29:01.992 --> 29:03.825
Either he's got
his cell phone turned off

29:03.827 --> 29:04.693
or he's left the area.

29:04.695 --> 29:05.944
TONY:
I don't think so.

29:05.946 --> 29:07.746
Metro P.D. just spotted a guy

29:07.748 --> 29:09.331
matching Captain Westcott's
description.

29:09.333 --> 29:11.816
Where?
Third and Rose, downtown.

29:11.818 --> 29:12.651
ZIVA: That is right
near the spot

29:12.653 --> 29:14.419
of Lieutenant Torres' death.

29:14.421 --> 29:15.337
GIBBS:
You guys stay here.

29:15.339 --> 29:17.339
I got DiNozzo. Let's move.

29:27.850 --> 29:31.269
Hey. Westcott.

29:31.271 --> 29:34.139
(mumbling)

29:37.226 --> 29:39.811
Captain Westcott.

29:39.813 --> 29:41.346
Special Agent Gibbs.

29:41.348 --> 29:42.864
Put down the knife.

29:43.733 --> 29:45.900
(grunts)

29:45.902 --> 29:48.370
General, put down your weapon!

29:51.907 --> 29:53.375
Your men need you.

29:59.031 --> 30:00.415
You're not alone.

30:18.100 --> 30:20.735
I think I need help.

30:32.472 --> 30:33.664
Turn it off.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.415
Turn it...
(beep)

30:35.417 --> 30:37.066
This is hard.
I feel

30:37.068 --> 30:38.067
like I'm going crazy.

30:38.069 --> 30:39.085
You're not.

30:39.087 --> 30:40.503
How do you know that?
Because...

30:40.505 --> 30:42.071
I had my own head

30:42.073 --> 30:44.424
scrambled once a long time ago.

30:45.292 --> 30:47.243
I'm telling you

30:47.245 --> 30:48.511
something happened to me
that night, Agent Gibbs.

30:48.513 --> 30:49.545
I don't...

30:49.547 --> 30:51.464
I got confused.

30:54.635 --> 30:57.437
Like I was someplace else.

30:57.439 --> 30:59.255
You back at the ambush?

31:00.107 --> 31:02.525
It's okay.

31:03.394 --> 31:05.395
It's okay to talk about it.

31:07.448 --> 31:09.098
It's okay to talk about...

31:09.100 --> 31:10.900
Marines you lost.

31:11.768 --> 31:13.936
(sighs)

31:16.040 --> 31:18.324
They were damn good men.

31:19.793 --> 31:21.127
All of them.

31:21.129 --> 31:22.611
But they never
had a chance, 'cause

31:22.613 --> 31:24.163
the enemy came out
of nowhere.

31:25.015 --> 31:26.349
And I was convinced...

31:26.351 --> 31:28.217
I was convinced
that that guy on the tape

31:28.219 --> 31:29.419
was there.

31:29.421 --> 31:30.970
Fighting

31:30.972 --> 31:31.971
with the other side.

31:31.973 --> 31:33.840
Randall Kersey
lives in Virginia.

31:33.842 --> 31:37.510
(sighs) His passport says he's never
been to Afghanistan.

31:38.345 --> 31:39.812
Then why did I follow him?

31:39.814 --> 31:43.816
Your mind plays tricks on you
when you're in pain.

31:46.820 --> 31:48.821
When I saw him in
the store that night,

31:48.823 --> 31:50.073
I don't know,
I didn't...

31:50.075 --> 31:53.276
know what was real
and what wasn't.

31:53.278 --> 31:55.411
<i>I lost control.</i>
(panting)

31:55.413 --> 31:56.979
(shouting)

31:56.981 --> 31:59.582
I felt like I had
to fight for my life,

31:59.584 --> 32:00.950
for Torres' life.

32:00.952 --> 32:04.253
(gasping, grunting)

32:04.255 --> 32:07.290
I was back in Arghanda
all over again.

32:07.292 --> 32:09.125
Move! Move! Move!

32:10.060 --> 32:12.295
(gunfire, shouting)

32:15.299 --> 32:16.366
Get down!

32:16.368 --> 32:18.701
Fall back! Fall back!

32:18.703 --> 32:20.386
Fall back!

32:20.388 --> 32:22.238
Captain!

32:22.240 --> 32:23.306
Captain!

32:23.308 --> 32:24.874
Captain...!

32:26.243 --> 32:27.560
I thought I saw Torres being

32:27.562 --> 32:29.529
dragged away in the alley
that night, but it was really

32:29.531 --> 32:31.647
<i>PFC Hall in Arghanda.</i>

32:31.649 --> 32:32.648
Captain!

32:33.784 --> 32:34.951
<i>Then I got scared.</i>

32:34.953 --> 32:36.919
<i>Then I ran.</i>

32:36.921 --> 32:38.554
(gunfire, men shouting
in distance)

32:38.556 --> 32:40.823
<i>One of my men went in</i>
<i>and grabbed Hall,</i>

32:40.825 --> 32:42.725
<i>brought him back to the unit.</i>

32:42.727 --> 32:45.244
But he didn't make it.

32:45.246 --> 32:47.580
You see, I couldn't save Hall,
I couldn't save Torres--

32:47.582 --> 32:50.466
I... I'm just a big damn coward.
No, you're not a coward.

32:50.468 --> 32:53.086
You're human.
I don't know how to do this.

32:53.088 --> 32:54.337
I don't, and I'm supposed to be

32:54.339 --> 32:56.672
the one everybody leans on,
"The General."

32:56.674 --> 32:58.141
You'll get back there,
I promise.

32:58.143 --> 33:01.427
But what if I can't?

33:01.429 --> 33:05.298
What if I'm stuck like this?
You won't be.

33:06.150 --> 33:08.067
Face the fear.

33:10.521 --> 33:12.405
MAN:
<i>Captain Westcott,</i>

33:12.407 --> 33:14.741
I'm Lieutenant Commander
Peter Sanger

33:14.743 --> 33:16.943
from Portsmouth
Naval Hospital.

33:16.945 --> 33:19.228
You can feel free
to call me Dr. Pete.

33:19.230 --> 33:20.329
Most people do.

33:20.331 --> 33:22.248
Now, first I just
want to commend you

33:22.250 --> 33:24.250
for reaching out
to Agent Gibbs.

33:24.252 --> 33:25.835
The hardest part

33:25.837 --> 33:28.121
is asking for help.

33:28.123 --> 33:30.373
Post-traumatic stress
is a complicated disorder

33:30.375 --> 33:33.342
affecting many of our
military's finest.

33:33.344 --> 33:35.378
It feels like I'm the only one.

33:35.380 --> 33:36.629
Well, you're not.

33:36.631 --> 33:38.047
Trust me.

33:38.049 --> 33:39.298
Now, besides

33:39.300 --> 33:42.135
these, um,
recurring flashbacks,

33:42.137 --> 33:46.856
are you experiencing
any nightmares or insomnia,

33:46.858 --> 33:49.559
anger, irritability,
panic attacks?

33:49.561 --> 33:53.112
Yes, sir.
And which ones, Captain?

33:53.114 --> 33:54.730
All of them, sir.

33:57.151 --> 33:58.985
(clears throat)

33:58.987 --> 34:01.871
For how long?

34:01.873 --> 34:04.290
It started
right after I got back,

34:04.292 --> 34:06.159
so about eight months ago.

34:06.161 --> 34:08.411
And this is
the first time

34:08.413 --> 34:09.911
you're sharing this
with your brother?

34:09.914 --> 34:11.797
Um... it's
nobody else's problem.

34:11.800 --> 34:16.252
You do need to remember that
you're not a burden, Captain.

34:17.087 --> 34:19.472
I'm sorry.

34:19.474 --> 34:22.007
Don't be--
it is what it is.

34:22.010 --> 34:24.594
EVAN: No,
Joe, I...

34:24.596 --> 34:26.179
I'm sorry.

34:26.181 --> 34:28.313
I mean, I knew
you weren't right,

34:28.315 --> 34:30.817
but I didn't
want to face it.

34:33.353 --> 34:35.353
I just want you
to be okay.

34:35.356 --> 34:38.608
(quiet sigh)

34:39.443 --> 34:41.994
I know, little brother.
Me, too.

34:42.830 --> 34:44.780
(sniffles)

34:50.820 --> 34:53.656
I thought you, uh,
you had to work, sir.

34:53.658 --> 34:55.991
I took some time off.

34:55.993 --> 34:58.895
Your brother said
I needed to be here.

35:00.547 --> 35:02.348
What's going on, son?

35:03.433 --> 35:05.635
Have a seat, Mr. Westcott.

35:06.520 --> 35:08.437
Doc will fill you in.

35:09.306 --> 35:11.140
Doctor?

35:13.443 --> 35:16.062
Are you sick?

35:16.064 --> 35:19.532
Dad... sit down, please.

35:24.371 --> 35:26.539
There you are.

35:27.691 --> 35:30.192
Are you looking at
more homely pictures?

35:30.194 --> 35:34.497
(laughs)
(sighs)

35:34.499 --> 35:37.032
(sighs)

35:40.137 --> 35:42.471
Are you all right, Tony?

35:45.542 --> 35:48.060
Can I show you something?

35:48.896 --> 35:51.046
Yes.

35:54.351 --> 35:56.602
♪

36:05.279 --> 36:07.530
Is this your mother?

36:07.532 --> 36:10.199
Yes.
(laughs)

36:10.201 --> 36:13.252
Wow, she was...
she was beautiful.

36:13.254 --> 36:15.738
Oh.

36:18.125 --> 36:20.710
I... I guess she was.

36:20.712 --> 36:23.912
How come you never talk about her?
I don't?

36:23.914 --> 36:25.598
No.

36:26.916 --> 36:29.018
No, you don't.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.353
Hm.

36:31.688 --> 36:34.190
Well, I guess, uh...

36:35.592 --> 36:38.311
...she was the first
woman to break my heart,

36:38.313 --> 36:42.732
and I don't like to talk
about things like that.

36:42.734 --> 36:46.435
You don't like to talk about it
because you don't want to.

36:48.271 --> 36:50.957
Maybe it causes
you too much pain.

36:57.080 --> 37:00.166
So she was the one
that took you to the movies, huh?

37:00.168 --> 37:01.667
Yeah.

37:01.669 --> 37:03.952
Yeah, we would go
to these, uh,

37:03.954 --> 37:05.721
dollar matinees,
make these weekend trips

37:05.723 --> 37:08.557
into the city, and...
there was this theater

37:08.559 --> 37:10.509
that she loved
over on 42nd Street.

37:10.511 --> 37:12.478
(chuckles)
It was pretty rundown,

37:12.480 --> 37:14.647
but... she loved movies.

37:14.649 --> 37:17.566
You know, and, uh...

37:17.568 --> 37:21.237
I think she loved
the escape.

37:25.659 --> 37:29.144
This was the last movie
we ever saw together.

37:29.997 --> 37:32.248
Right before she...

37:35.035 --> 37:37.003
The Little Prince.

37:37.005 --> 37:39.672
Mm.

37:41.541 --> 37:45.428
"That which is essential
is invisible to the eye""

37:46.996 --> 37:49.665
Ziva David, did you
just quote a movie?

37:49.667 --> 37:52.635
No. I quoted a book...

37:52.637 --> 37:55.054
that was made
into a movie.

37:56.306 --> 37:58.557
Huh.

37:59.409 --> 38:01.527
(chuckles)

38:08.702 --> 38:10.036
(door closes)
(sighs)

38:10.038 --> 38:13.823
Well, not so good with the emotions,
my old man.

38:13.825 --> 38:16.191
Well, you can't worry
about your father right now, Captain.

38:16.193 --> 38:17.827
You have to take
care of yourself.

38:17.829 --> 38:19.795
But if you need
anything else,

38:19.797 --> 38:22.498
day or night, you just
give me a call, okay?

38:22.500 --> 38:23.916
I'm here.

38:23.918 --> 38:25.301
Will do.

38:30.924 --> 38:32.725
No more messing around, huh?

38:32.727 --> 38:35.344
I guess the real
work starts now?

38:35.346 --> 38:37.096
Yep.

38:37.098 --> 38:38.647
Looks like it.

38:39.516 --> 38:41.484
Hey, listen,

38:41.486 --> 38:43.686
if I have to lie back on a couch

38:43.688 --> 38:46.021
and talk about
the pet bunny that I lost

38:46.023 --> 38:48.524
when I was three,
I'm coming after you, Agent Gibbs.

38:48.526 --> 38:50.109
Yeah, okay. I got it.
Big-time.

38:51.661 --> 38:53.829
You're a good man.

38:55.082 --> 38:57.500
Oorah, Agent Gibbs.

38:57.502 --> 38:59.368
Oorah.

38:59.370 --> 39:02.070
General.

39:04.407 --> 39:06.592
Well, as fun as that
all-dog talent show sounds,

39:06.594 --> 39:09.095
I've still got some stuff
to finish up here, Abby.

39:09.097 --> 39:10.379
Meet you for dinner later?

39:10.381 --> 39:12.298
Yep.
Okay. Bye.

39:15.552 --> 39:17.770
What have we here?

39:17.772 --> 39:19.421
Hey.

39:19.423 --> 39:22.090
Ziva, what were
those three initials

39:22.092 --> 39:24.393
that Gibbs was
talking about? I-J...

39:24.395 --> 39:26.195
I-J-I. Why
do you ask?

39:26.197 --> 39:28.114
Marines' After-Action Report
of the Arghanda Ambush

39:28.116 --> 39:29.482
just came through.

39:29.484 --> 39:31.099
They I.D.'d
the group responsible.

39:31.101 --> 39:33.602
The Ijil Rebels.
McGEE: So maybe

39:33.604 --> 39:35.994
Captain Westcott really <i>was</i>
trying to remember something.

39:36.019 --> 39:37.440
GIBBS: Yeah. Or someone.

39:37.441 --> 39:39.625
GIBBS: Background. Go.
TONY: Well, it looks like State

39:39.627 --> 39:41.460
just added them
to their watch list.

39:41.462 --> 39:42.578
They're young, growing fast,

39:42.580 --> 39:44.497
strong ties
to Hamas and Hezbollah.

39:44.499 --> 39:45.614
McGee, location.
McGEE: Last known

39:45.616 --> 39:47.883
headquarters were
in the Kanjal Province.

39:47.885 --> 39:50.002
ZIVA: That is less than
five miles from Arghanda.

39:50.004 --> 39:51.787
Close enough to keep
an eye on Westcott's unit.

39:51.789 --> 39:54.473
Close enough to launch a surprise
nighttime attack. Surveillance.

39:54.475 --> 39:56.759
CIA sent in a drone
to monitor activities.

39:56.761 --> 39:59.127
Looks like there
may be some photos on file.

39:59.129 --> 40:00.062
Get tighter.

40:05.769 --> 40:07.636
Boss, isn't that...?

40:07.638 --> 40:10.606
Randall Kersay really <i>was</i>
fighting with the enemy.

40:10.608 --> 40:12.992
McGEE: Okay, boss,
he's in Rosslyn, Virginia,

40:12.994 --> 40:15.528
just off the I-66.
Let's go.

40:19.683 --> 40:21.700
(gate creaks)

40:25.288 --> 40:26.755
(knocking)

40:45.442 --> 40:46.842
ZIVA: Clear!
TONY: Clear!

40:46.844 --> 40:48.510
Either he never
actually lived here,

40:48.512 --> 40:50.846
or he knew how
to clean up well.

40:53.900 --> 40:57.703
Hey, boss, you might want
to come out and look at this.

41:11.585 --> 41:13.469
What is that?

41:14.304 --> 41:16.722
GIBBS:
It's a building blueprint.

41:19.142 --> 41:21.227
TONY: Looks like our wannabe
John Walker Lindh

41:21.229 --> 41:22.311
was planning something.

41:22.313 --> 41:23.929
Something big.

41:23.931 --> 41:26.232
Not <i>was.</i>

41:26.234 --> 41:28.267
Is.

41:28.269 --> 41:29.602
Find him.

41:29.604 --> 41:33.604
