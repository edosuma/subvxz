01:13.089 --> 01:16.960
Now, remember what I told you. Plant your
elbow inside your knee, like this, All right.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.660
And don't just lift your arm.
Pull the weight to your shoulder.

01:19.700 --> 01:20.710
Good, good.

01:20.809 --> 01:23.369
Now, exhale on exertion.

01:23.450 --> 01:25.440
Try grunting. It helps.

01:27.450 --> 01:30.040
Good guy, Brad. You're gonna be
real strong if you keep this up.

01:30.129 --> 01:32.399
I'm gonna be the strongest one
on the football team.

01:32.490 --> 01:33.710
I can see it now.

01:33.809 --> 01:36.800
"Bradley Taylor, the muscular son
of Tim Taylor, is carrying the ball."

01:36.889 --> 01:40.839
"He's got 60 people dragging behind him.
30, the 20, the ten."

01:40.930 --> 01:44.399
"Oh, he fell because his muscles
are just too big."

01:45.369 --> 01:49.040
Hey, Brad.
Your muscles look really big.

01:49.169 --> 01:52.440
- Think so?
- Yeah. The one in your head.

01:52.530 --> 01:54.879
- You'd better watch it.
- Settle, boys.

01:54.970 --> 01:57.720
I'll give you haircuts.

01:58.730 --> 02:01.800
Whoa. Muscle beach
right here in my own garage.

02:01.889 --> 02:06.520
Wrong, honey.
This is the Tim Taylor Testosterone Hour.

02:07.450 --> 02:09.520
I got an idea.
Let's flex for her.

02:09.609 --> 02:12.800
Drop the weights.
Brad, take the coat off.

02:13.450 --> 02:17.119
Right, guys, prepare yourselves.
Ready?

02:17.210 --> 02:20.240
The Egyptian biception.

02:20.329 --> 02:22.359
Whoa.

02:22.970 --> 02:25.399
Buttocks, flex.

02:28.889 --> 02:31.000
Three-point crab.

02:31.089 --> 02:34.079
Whoa. Very scary.
Incredible. Ten points.

02:34.169 --> 02:38.399
I pump for you,
my little edelweiss.

02:44.089 --> 02:46.079
Vere's de oil?

02:46.169 --> 02:49.319
Well, stick around.
I'll smear you with bacon grease.

02:49.409 --> 02:51.760
I'll be back.

02:51.849 --> 02:54.680
Tim, don't forget to pick up some videos
tonight after work.

02:54.770 --> 02:56.919
Yeah. Dad, how about we get
B4ry Me Again?

02:57.010 --> 03:01.040
- Hey, no! It's family night.
- Yeah, yeah, it's family night.

03:01.129 --> 03:04.960
- How about <i>Bayonet Hell</i> ?
- Yeah!

03:05.050 --> 03:08.040
Hey! It's my turn to pick.
You're gonna get <i>Sound of Music</i>.

03:12.770 --> 03:13.909
I'll get it.

03:14.010 --> 03:16.040
family movie.

03:16.129 --> 03:19.720
Hey. Dad, how about we get
fang Woman? She had a family.

03:19.809 --> 03:22.000
She ate her family.

03:23.450 --> 03:24.559
Tim!

03:24.649 --> 03:26.440
- Coming.
- He'll be right there.

03:26.530 --> 03:28.359
- What's the matter?
- Stu Cutler.

03:28.450 --> 03:30.750
- Calling from Akron?
- No. He's in town.

03:30.849 --> 03:33.599
- Great!
- Do not invite that slug over here tonight.

03:33.690 --> 03:36.760
Come on, he's one of my best friends.
Come on.

03:36.849 --> 03:39.079
Hey, puke-face!

03:39.169 --> 03:41.240
How's it hanging?

03:41.329 --> 03:43.839
And deep.

03:44.849 --> 03:47.839
So, they let you back in town?
Yeah.

03:47.930 --> 03:50.839
Oh, yeah, we gotta see each other.

03:50.930 --> 03:53.639
Jill would love to see you.

03:53.730 --> 03:56.030
This afternoon?

03:59.050 --> 04:01.349
I work… I gotta work this Saturday.
Yeah.

04:01.450 --> 04:04.280
We're working all day. Huh?
Come over there.

04:04.369 --> 04:07.760
Yeah. It'd be great.

04:07.849 --> 04:11.200
Not even with yo4r lips.
Yeah. See you.

04:12.569 --> 04:14.359
- Oh, boy.
- Please say he's not coming over tonight.

04:14.450 --> 04:16.909
This is family night. We have chilli,
corn bread, <i>The Sound of Music</i>.

04:17.010 --> 04:18.519
I didn't invite him over.

04:18.608 --> 04:21.639
I said I'd meet him after work, we'll have
a couple beers. I'll come home after that.

04:21.730 --> 04:25.159
- Alone.
- Yes. Why are you so hard on Stu?

04:25.250 --> 04:27.440
The last time he was here
he shook up a beer

04:27.530 --> 04:29.599
and sprayed it all over the family room.

04:29.690 --> 04:31.359
foam fight.
He likes to clown around.

04:31.450 --> 04:36.800
His idea of clowning around
is drinking and making body noises.

04:37.809 --> 04:39.919
o .

04:41.290 --> 04:44.359
He likes to drink beer and make music.

04:45.609 --> 04:49.879
Playing "The Girl from Ipanema"
in his armpit is not musical.

04:50.730 --> 04:53.680
You ever tried that?

04:54.730 --> 04:56.520
And that's how you beat Old Man Winter.

04:56.569 --> 04:59.800
by installing a properly clad
aluminum storm window

04:59.889 --> 05:02.919
inside your wood-frame window.

05:03.930 --> 05:07.000
Now, no less effective,
and sometimes less costly.

05:07.089 --> 05:10.359
is installing plastic sheeting
on the inside of your window. Right, Al?

05:10.450 --> 05:11.669
That's right, Tim.

05:11.770 --> 05:14.760
We've taken a three-millimeter
piece of plastic sheeting.

05:14.849 --> 05:17.599
cut it two inches larger
than our interior frame.

05:17.690 --> 05:21.389
Right, Al. And we've tucked it
over the top, taped it.

05:21.490 --> 05:25.440
and now are ready to shrink it
using an electric hair dryer. Lisa.

05:25.530 --> 05:28.480
- Here you go, Tim.
- Thanks.

05:28.569 --> 05:34.000
We do this to get a wrinkle-free,
clear covering over our windows.

05:43.770 --> 05:46.760
Now, this works best, but if you
don't happen to have a hair dryer.

05:46.849 --> 05:51.399
get your mother-in-law over to the house
and have her yap at the window for a while.

05:51.490 --> 05:55.960
You know, you should have married
Dr Conrad. He's a brain surgeon.

05:56.050 --> 05:58.839
No, you end up with
this loser on the tool show.

06:05.169 --> 06:07.240
I've just… You don't want..,
you don't want…

06:07.329 --> 06:09.440
You don't want to irritate
any mother-in-laws, do you, Al?

06:09.530 --> 06:12.760
You already have, Tim.

06:14.609 --> 06:17.399
That's it from me.
Tim "the tool man" Taylor.

06:17.490 --> 06:21.079
reminding you to get
those storm windows and doors in early.

06:21.169 --> 06:24.559
'cause you never know when that storm's
gonna come rolling through.

06:24.649 --> 06:26.639
See you next time.

06:33.889 --> 06:35.879
Taylor!

06:35.970 --> 06:38.040
Oh. God.

06:38.129 --> 06:40.040
Cutler?

06:40.129 --> 06:42.879
Hey, buddy!
Good to see you, man.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.440
- Good to see you too.
- See you Monday, Tim.

06:44.530 --> 06:46.599
Wait a minute, Al, come over here.
Please. Come on.

06:46.690 --> 06:50.760
This wild dog here is my college
roommate. Stu Cutler, Al Borland.

06:50.849 --> 06:52.839
- Hi. Stu.
- Hey, Al.

06:52.930 --> 06:56.710
Nice beard.
Had chilli for lunch?

06:57.530 --> 06:59.909
No. I didn't. Stu.

07:01.409 --> 07:04.399
So, gotta work with this jerk, huh, Al?

07:04.490 --> 07:07.200
Yes. I do. Stu.

07:10.169 --> 07:12.599
Well, it was nice meeting you.

07:16.329 --> 07:19.319
- Great sense of humor.
- Thank you.

07:22.050 --> 07:24.720
He's a serious guy,
but he knows his way around a shop.

07:24.809 --> 07:26.680
Whoa.

07:26.770 --> 07:29.119
Kill me. Just kill me now.

07:30.329 --> 07:33.520
She looks even better in person.
Introduce me.

07:33.609 --> 07:35.359
- No.
- Why not?

07:35.450 --> 07:37.440
Because she's a co-worker,
a good friend of mine

07:37.530 --> 07:41.200
and you're nothing but dried hog phlegm.

07:41.290 --> 07:43.669
Watch my move.

07:43.770 --> 07:46.800
- Hi. Stu Cutler.
- Bye, Tim. See you Monday.

07:46.889 --> 07:49.000
Night. Lise.

07:50.210 --> 07:52.440
Ah, boy.

07:52.530 --> 07:55.960
It's good to see
you still have it. Cutler.

07:56.050 --> 07:59.520
She's not your type, man.
She can see.

08:00.530 --> 08:02.200
Now, come on.
Let's go down and get a beer.

08:02.290 --> 08:05.000
- I'll get changed up and go.
- Your house?

08:05.089 --> 08:07.280
I thought we'd go to
the place on the corner we like.

08:07.369 --> 08:09.559
You're not going to take me
home to dinner?

08:09.649 --> 08:11.720
I thought that maybe just you and me
go out together.

08:11.809 --> 08:14.760
Wait, now. I can't come to town
without seeing Jill the pill.

08:14.849 --> 08:17.200
She'll understand.
Like, a guys' night out.

08:17.809 --> 08:20.960
What? So, you don't want me
to come to your house, is that it?

08:21.050 --> 08:23.879
No, no. Of course not.
You're always welcome at my house.

08:23.970 --> 08:26.349
Well… Let's go!

08:26.450 --> 08:28.000
Yeah, why not?

08:28.089 --> 08:30.919
Yeah, Jill'll be
so surprised to see you.

08:31.010 --> 08:34.879
- I can't wait to see her face.
- Me neither.

08:36.089 --> 08:37.039
Jill, Jill.

08:37.129 --> 08:39.480
Good, you're home.
You got rid of Stu fast.

08:39.568 --> 08:43.599
- I didn't get rid of him, he's parking his car.
- Oh, no. You brought him home?

08:43.690 --> 08:45.800
Jill, he really misses you.
He likes you.

08:45.889 --> 08:50.159
No, he doesn't. He just likes to make fun
of me and crush beer cans on his head.

08:50.250 --> 08:53.280
Well, they gotta be crushed
if we're gonna recycle them.

08:53.809 --> 08:56.190
I couldn't get rid of him.
I couldn't say no.

08:56.290 --> 08:57.879
He'll come over,
have a beer and that'll be it.

08:57.970 --> 09:01.589
OK. But if he crosses the line.
I'm personally gonna throw him out.

09:01.690 --> 09:02.750
What's "crossing the line"?

09:02.849 --> 09:05.720
Behavior that would be classified
as subhuman.

09:05.809 --> 09:08.369
Can't you be a little
more flexible than that?

09:09.010 --> 09:11.359
One beer and he is gone.

09:12.889 --> 09:16.430
- The Stu-ster's here!
- Beer. Stu?

09:16.530 --> 09:20.559
- Read my mind.
- Come on in, buddy.

09:20.649 --> 09:23.240
- Where's that Jill?
- Right here.

09:29.889 --> 09:32.119
God, you look good.
Now, you've lost some weight.

09:32.210 --> 09:35.879
- Yeah. I have. Thank you.
- Now there is a very human compliment.

09:35.970 --> 09:37.760
So, what's the goal?
Another ten?

09:39.849 --> 09:42.230
Tim, if you hadn't have married Jill.
I would have.

09:42.329 --> 09:46.599
Now there's something
to think about, honey.

09:48.970 --> 09:52.669
Well.., life would sure be different.

09:52.770 --> 09:55.680
Well, it sure would.
Timmy, you'd be visiting us tonight.

09:55.770 --> 09:59.639
And Jill would be a satisfied woman.

10:00.530 --> 10:05.720
- Almost done with that beer. Stu?
- Haven't even cracked it.

10:05.809 --> 10:09.159
- So, where's the boys?
- They're across the street.

10:09.250 --> 10:11.809
Well, get 'em over here.
I gotta see those wild puppies.

10:11.889 --> 10:14.919
Well, they wouldn't want
to miss the Stu-ster.

10:15.010 --> 10:17.000
Brad? Randy! Mark!

10:18.129 --> 10:20.280
foam fight!

10:20.369 --> 10:23.079
- Stu, come on.
- I wasn't really going to do it.

10:23.169 --> 10:25.399
- Good.
- I just wanted to see that look on Jill's face.

10:25.490 --> 10:29.160
Yeah. There's that look
right there.

10:30.169 --> 10:33.870
- Hey! Stu-ster.
- Hey, Randy! Whoa! Look at you!

10:33.970 --> 10:37.240
- Hey. Stu!
- The Brad-ster.

10:37.330 --> 10:40.039
You guys are getting so big. Pretty soon
you'll be able to take the old man.

10:40.129 --> 10:42.120
We already can.

10:43.209 --> 10:44.350
That hurt.

10:44.450 --> 10:47.160
- Uncle Stu!
- Marky.

10:47.249 --> 10:50.359
God, look at you.
You're getting so big and strong.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.879
We've been lifting Dad's weights.
Want to see 'em?

10:52.970 --> 10:55.479
- Well, sure. Where are they?
- In the garage. Come on.

10:55.569 --> 10:57.560
Yeah.

10:57.649 --> 10:59.999
Daddy was posing for Mommy.

11:00.089 --> 11:02.919
Posing as what? A man?

11:08.410 --> 11:10.760
Well, did he cross the line?

11:10.850 --> 11:13.760
Honey, you got to admit, it's an
interesting way to begin family night, huh?

11:39.010 --> 11:41.569
- Hey. Taylor. Think quick.
- Boy.

11:41.649 --> 11:44.680
- Crushed and ready to recycle.
- It's official. One beer and he's gone.

11:44.769 --> 11:47.439
I'm way ahead of you.
I'll get him to go.

11:47.530 --> 11:50.240
Hey, guys. You go inside and help
set the table. I'm gonna talk to Uncle Stu.

11:50.330 --> 11:54.109
Not so fast, poser.
I got 150 pounds on here.

11:54.209 --> 11:58.720
Boys. I don't think the old man
can bench-press this.

11:58.810 --> 12:00.600
- One hand.
- Show him. Dad.

12:00.689 --> 12:03.519
- Yeah. Do it.
- Spot me. Cutler.

12:14.370 --> 12:17.080
Were you gonna do this
sometime today?

12:18.689 --> 12:20.680
She's up.

12:24.050 --> 12:27.720
He's turning red.
I hope his eyes don't pop out.

12:31.890 --> 12:34.120
Are you OK. Dad?

12:37.729 --> 12:40.479
- It's easy when you use the right form.
- Yeah.

12:40.569 --> 12:44.479
- Are you gonna cry?
- No. I'm not gonna cry.

12:44.569 --> 12:47.919
Go set the table.

12:53.490 --> 12:57.109
Hey, you didn't strain anything,
did you?

12:57.209 --> 12:59.319
I'll knock you out.

12:59.410 --> 13:01.519
Hey, remember how we used
to go to the gym.

13:01.609 --> 13:04.169
practically kill ourselves
trying to impress Donna Gilmore?

13:04.249 --> 13:08.640
Donna Gilmore.
I haven't seen or heard from her in years.

13:08.729 --> 13:14.680
Hey, remember? You and me and Donna
driving around in our '68 Impala.

13:14.769 --> 13:17.359
top down,
her blonde hair blowing in the wind?

13:19.450 --> 13:23.120
- God, she was a beauty.
- Sure was. What a car.

13:25.450 --> 13:28.120
That was a 327 small block, man.

13:28.209 --> 13:31.439
I had a big Holley 850
dual feed on that thing.

13:31.530 --> 13:35.879
I had tubular headers, glass packs,
chromed the canooter valve.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.999
- Hey! You know what I got?
- I know what you got.

13:39.089 --> 13:43.919
- Picture of that Impala.
- Hood up, hood down.

13:44.010 --> 13:45.479
There's a screaming machine.

13:45.569 --> 13:48.479
This would be a classic today,
if it weren't for that little fire we had.

13:48.569 --> 13:52.560
And I know I tightened
that fuel filter on it. It wasn't my fault.

13:52.649 --> 13:54.839
Yeah, we've had some good times,
haven't we?

13:54.930 --> 13:57.120
- Yeah, we have.
- Yeah.

13:57.890 --> 14:02.120
Don't you wish we could go back,
live those days all over again?

14:02.209 --> 14:04.439
They were great.

14:04.530 --> 14:06.600
but today's real good, you know?

14:06.689 --> 14:08.839
Not the same.

14:08.930 --> 14:14.560
Just look me straight in the eye and
tell me that wasn't the best time of your life.

14:14.649 --> 14:17.959
It was good. It was good.

14:18.050 --> 14:21.200
Listen. Stu, Jill and I were talking.
Tonight's family night…

14:21.289 --> 14:23.720
Hey, wait. You've already
made me feel like family.

14:23.810 --> 14:26.269
- No, what I'm trying…
- Know what we need here? Another beer.

14:26.370 --> 14:28.959
I'm all out of beer.
I should have thought of that.

14:29.050 --> 14:31.720
I'll just go get some more.

14:34.370 --> 14:36.959
- Where's my coat?
- Stu, are you leaving?

14:37.249 --> 14:38.080
Yeah.

14:38.169 --> 14:42.120
Well, it was so nice to see you.
I hope we can do it again.

14:42.209 --> 14:45.600
Well. Let's do it again in 15 minutes.
I'm just going to get some beer.

14:45.689 --> 14:48.120
Beer?

14:49.330 --> 14:53.640
- Be my contribution to dinner.
- Well, thanks.

14:53.729 --> 14:55.479
Jill.

14:55.569 --> 14:59.999
that pile of human vermin
is the best friend I ever had.

15:00.089 --> 15:03.439
Stu, you should write greeting cards.

15:08.089 --> 15:10.200
There it was.

15:13.289 --> 15:15.200
You want to taste this chilli?

15:15.289 --> 15:19.919
I told you I'd get him to go after one beer.
I didn't say he wouldn't be coming back.

15:20.010 --> 15:21.839
Try it.

15:22.890 --> 15:24.879
It's good.

15:26.450 --> 15:28.879
I know that we all used to be friends
in college and everything, but…

15:28.970 --> 15:32.510
do you.., like Stu now?

15:32.609 --> 15:36.720
I know he can be a pain,
but we've shared a lot of good times.

15:36.810 --> 15:39.479
Well, if you just met him today
for the first time.

15:39.569 --> 15:41.720
- do you think you would become friends?
- Yeah.

15:41.810 --> 15:45.399
- Really?
- He's a lot of laughs.

15:46.249 --> 15:48.479
I guess I just don't get it.

15:48.569 --> 15:51.560
Well, it's.., it's a guy thing.

15:55.209 --> 15:56.319
Wilson?

15:56.410 --> 15:59.479
- Hi-ho, neighbor.
- What are you doing?

15:59.569 --> 16:02.560
Oh, just pounding myself
some horseshoes.

16:02.649 --> 16:06.839
Wouldn't a pair of loafers
be more comfortable?

16:06.930 --> 16:08.919
No, no, no, Tim.

16:12.249 --> 16:14.879
These are shoes that I toss.

16:14.970 --> 16:18.919
Look at this, Tim. Perfect weight,
perfect balance. Aerodynamically correct.

16:19.010 --> 16:20.399
Yeah.

16:20.490 --> 16:23.399
And very, very hot.

16:23.490 --> 16:26.640
I tell you, Tim. I love this game.

16:26.729 --> 16:30.760
What it is, it's all in the wrist.

16:32.169 --> 16:36.160
- Wilson, can I ask you something?
- Make your best pitch, Tim.

16:36.249 --> 16:40.560
I've got this old friend in town, and I always
think we're gonna have a lot of fun.

16:40.649 --> 16:43.240
but instead we always talk about
all the fun we used to have.

16:43.330 --> 16:47.030
Well, there's nothing wrong
with reminiscing, Tim.

16:47.129 --> 16:49.760
But he thinks I'm the same guy
I was 15 years ago.

16:52.129 --> 16:55.160
And I try to be that guy,
but I'm really not.

16:55.249 --> 16:58.240
Well, it sounds like he's spending
all his time looking backwards

16:58.330 --> 17:02.030
and you're spending yours
looking forward.

17:03.490 --> 17:05.599
That's it.
I can't keep up with this guy.

17:05.689 --> 17:11.240
The thought of crushing a beer can
on my head makes my butt quiver.

17:13.169 --> 17:16.439
Well, that's why I gave it up, Tim.

17:19.410 --> 17:21.079
I don't know what to do about him.

17:21.169 --> 17:24.950
Well, it sounds to me like you're having
a hard time saying goodbye.

17:25.050 --> 17:29.519
Why should I say goodbye? He's been
one of my best friends for 15 years.

17:29.609 --> 17:33.479
Well, has he, Tim? Or was he
your best friend 15 years ago?

17:33.930 --> 17:36.200
You see, Tim. I believe
it was St. Paul who said:

17:36.289 --> 17:42.760
"When I was a child I spoke as a child. I
understood as a child. I thought as a child.

17:42.850 --> 17:46.470
but when I became a man.
I put away childish things."

17:56.050 --> 17:58.760
Guess who I ran into
down at the store?

17:58.850 --> 18:00.959
Mike Forshay and Tino.

18:01.050 --> 18:04.039
Hey, Tino.
What are those guys up to now?

18:04.129 --> 18:06.280
They're still a couple of wild dogs.

18:06.370 --> 18:08.519
They're going down to Club Piranha
and get crazy.

18:08.609 --> 18:10.080
I told them you and I'd meet 'em there.

18:10.169 --> 18:12.519
I'm not going to Club Piranha.

18:12.609 --> 18:14.280
But you have to go!

18:14.370 --> 18:17.399
You remember back in college,
the four of us stayed up 36 hours.

18:17.490 --> 18:22.430
then drove halfway to Mexico City
with the emergency brake on?

18:22.530 --> 18:25.120
- I'm not going out tonight.
- Why not?

18:25.209 --> 18:29.399
I thought we were gonna stay here.
Watch TV, the video, chilli with the kids.

18:29.490 --> 18:32.760
- Oh, right. The family thing.
- Yeah.

18:32.850 --> 18:36.800
No problem. I'll call Tino and Forshay, they
can get a keg of beer and come over here.

18:36.890 --> 18:38.999
No. Stu. No.

18:39.089 --> 18:43.039
Hey! This is Tino and Forshay.
It'll be like old times.

18:43.129 --> 18:45.640
Tell you what, why don't
you go down to Club Piranha

18:45.729 --> 18:47.359
and you hang out
with those guys tonight?

18:47.450 --> 18:50.680
Without you?
Come on! It won't be the same.

18:50.769 --> 18:53.999
Stu. I don't think it is the same.

18:58.729 --> 19:01.720
Dad, dinner's ready.
Can I turn on the video?

19:01.810 --> 19:04.439
- Not now.
- OK.

19:11.089 --> 19:13.680
- What are you watching?
- <i>Sound of M4sic</i>.

19:13.769 --> 19:16.359
<i>Sound of Music</i> ?

19:17.370 --> 19:20.439
Maybe I will go down
and meet Forshay and Tino.

19:20.530 --> 19:23.839
Would I be a real jerk if I skipped dinner
and kind of headed out?

19:23.930 --> 19:26.039
No, no, not at all. Skip.

19:26.129 --> 19:29.080
- Well. I just don't want to disappoint Jill.
- Don't worry about it.

19:29.169 --> 19:33.160
It'll be rough,
but I'll be able to smooth it out.

19:35.890 --> 19:38.160
How lovely.
We'll have dinner music.

19:39.410 --> 19:41.640
- Boys.
- Perfect timing.

19:41.729 --> 19:44.879
- Come on. Uncle Stu. Sit by us.
- Yeah.

19:44.970 --> 19:48.749
Well, buddies. I gotta be heading out.

19:48.850 --> 19:50.800
Jill. I know this is
a tremendous disappointment.

19:50.890 --> 19:53.640
All of you. Stu can't stay for dinner
or the movie.

19:55.169 --> 19:57.600
I ran into some old buddies.

19:57.689 --> 20:01.519
We're just gonna go out,
have some coffee and talk.

20:01.609 --> 20:03.910
Coffee?

20:05.050 --> 20:06.919
- Bye, Jill.
- Goodbye. It was nice to see you.

20:07.010 --> 20:10.550
It was good to see you, too.
You be good, huh?

20:10.649 --> 20:12.399
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

20:12.490 --> 20:13.839
- Bye.
- Take care.

20:13.930 --> 20:15.600
Bye. Uncle Stu.

20:15.689 --> 20:18.640
If you and Tino and Forshay get crazy,
you call a cab. OK?

20:18.729 --> 20:20.999
Always do.

20:22.249 --> 20:26.240
Hey. Next time I'm in town. I'll give you
a little more warning when I call.

20:26.359 --> 20:27.990
Do that.

20:28.079 --> 20:32.029
We'll still get together.
Hang out. Have some laughs.

20:32.119 --> 20:35.109
- Just like the old days, eh?
- Like the old days.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.190
Hey, man. See ya.

20:39.039 --> 20:41.029
- Tell you what, keep the beer.
- You go ahead.

20:41.119 --> 20:43.269
Come on.

20:44.359 --> 20:47.190
- See you.
- See you.

20:56.240 --> 20:58.799
- Everything OK?
- Perfect.

20:58.880 --> 21:01.829
- OK. Dad, the movie's ready.
- OK, All right.

21:01.920 --> 21:03.349
- Everybody can see?
- Yup.

21:03.440 --> 21:05.789
Oh, wait.
I need my box of tissues.

21:06.839 --> 21:09.750
- OK.
- Ready?

21:12.240 --> 21:15.710
Wait, this isn't <i>Sound of Music</i>.
This is… <i>Bayonet Hell</i>.

21:15.799 --> 21:18.069
Yeah!

21:22.039 --> 21:24.599
Last time we showed you
how to install an aluminum storm window

21:24.680 --> 21:26.269
on an existing wooden frame.

21:26.359 --> 21:29.589
Today, we hung a storm door
on an existing wood frame.

21:29.680 --> 21:32.059
Now, the important thing
about putting a door in is hanging it.

21:32.160 --> 21:36.750
'cause if it's not hung well,
you got a problem. Right, Al?

21:36.839 --> 21:39.910
Speak for yourself, Tim.

21:48.720 --> 21:52.339
When installing a door, you gotta
make it fit exactly like it's supposed to,

21:52.440 --> 21:54.670
so make sure your hinge
is aligned with the king stud.

21:54.759 --> 21:57.630
Well, thank you, Tim.

21:57.720 --> 21:59.950
It's also very important
to remember

22:00.039 --> 22:03.430
that doors often change with age.

22:03.519 --> 22:06.950
The older a door gets,

22:07.960 --> 22:09.990
the more warped it becomes.

22:10.079 --> 22:14.789
Sometimes we forget
that things change with age.

22:14.880 --> 22:17.549
So, remember:

22:17.640 --> 22:21.390
check those doors.
They might not fit like you remember.

22:35.839 --> 22:39.269
- Stand by, please.
- OK. Let's do that five count.

22:39.359 --> 22:42.430
four. Three.

22:42.519 --> 22:46.509
And five, four, three, two…

22:46.599 --> 22:49.509
As you remember, last time we showed
you how to install aluminum storm windows

22:49.599 --> 22:53.750
in an ex.., existing storm door.

22:53.839 --> 22:57.869
Good night. I'm here all week.
Try the veal.

22:57.960 --> 23:00.670
- OK. I'll get it this time.
- OK. Here we go.

23:00.759 --> 23:02.230
We're having fun.
That's what counts.

23:02.319 --> 23:04.589
- In five, four…
- This camera here?

23:04.680 --> 23:05.789
- Here?
- Right here.

23:05.880 --> 23:09.309
- All right. Well, let's go here then.
- five, four, three, two…

23:09.400 --> 23:11.470
Two, phew…

23:11.559 --> 23:16.190
five, four, three, two…

23:16.279 --> 23:18.470
On last week's show…
Excuse me, let's start again.

23:18.559 --> 23:22.029
Now remember,
the most important port…

23:24.279 --> 23:29.400
Last time we showed you how to install
your storm window over existing storm…

23:29.480 --> 23:32.109
- Roll it. Stand by, please.
- Except sign my check.

23:32.200 --> 23:33.390
Stand by, please.
