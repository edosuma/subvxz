WEBVTT

00:02.836 --> 00:04.072
(Mindy)
I THINK THAT WAS THE BEST
WEDDING I'VE EVER BEEN TO.

00:04.105 --> 00:05.273
THE BRIDE WAS
OLDER THAN ME

00:05.306 --> 00:06.374
AND SHE WEIGHED MORE
THAN ME.

00:06.407 --> 00:07.241
DID YOU NOTICE THAT?

00:07.275 --> 00:08.309
I STILL DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD'VE BROUGHT

00:08.342 --> 00:09.577
A GIFT
TO A SECOND WEDDING.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.079
YOU KNOW?
IT'S REWARDING FAILURE.

00:11.112 --> 00:12.746
[police sirens]

00:12.780 --> 00:14.082
OH, NO.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.483
OH, FOR PETE'S SAKE.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.118
(Danny)
THIS IS WHY
I SHOULD'VE DRIVEN.

00:17.151 --> 00:18.018
(Mindy)
YOU HAD FOUR DRINKS.

00:18.052 --> 00:20.388
YEAH, BUT DRUNK ME
IS SAFER THAN SOBER YOU.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.256
RELAX. I'VE BEEN
PULLED OVER A HUNDRED TIMES,

00:22.290 --> 00:24.192
AND I'VE NEVER ONCE
GOTTEN A TICKET.
HOW?

00:24.225 --> 00:25.693
THE WAY I GET OUT
OF EVERYTHING--

00:25.726 --> 00:26.694
LYING AND CRYING.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.297
OKAY, FINE.

00:29.330 --> 00:30.564
OFFICER, THE REASON
WE WERE SPEEDING

00:30.598 --> 00:32.233
IS BECAUSE WE WERE
RUSHING AWAY

00:32.266 --> 00:34.235
FROM THIS DEVASTATING
FUNERAL

00:34.268 --> 00:36.270
OF A VERY CLOSE FRIEND
OF OURS WHO DIED.

00:36.304 --> 00:38.172
AND THE FUNERAL HAD
A PHOTO BOOTH...

00:38.206 --> 00:39.307
WITH PROP MOUSTACHES?

00:39.340 --> 00:41.509
[fake sobbing]

00:41.542 --> 00:43.477
YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:43.511 --> 00:45.846
JUST GIVE ME A TICKET.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.181
I CAN'T HAVE A BABY!

00:47.215 --> 00:48.782
CALM DOWN!
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK!

00:48.816 --> 00:50.218
CALM DOWN,
I'LL CUT YOU A BREAK.

00:50.251 --> 00:51.685
I'LL CUT YOU
A BREAK.
REALLY?

00:51.719 --> 00:53.087
YOU REMIND ME
OF THE DEMENTED AUNT

00:53.121 --> 00:54.155
THAT RAISED ME.

00:54.188 --> 00:56.390
THAT'S THE NICEST THING
ANYONE'S EVER SAID TO ME.

00:56.424 --> 00:57.625
DRIVE SAFE.

00:57.658 --> 01:01.229
[crying] THANK YOU.
YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD GUY.

01:03.231 --> 01:04.665
AND THAT IS HOW
IT'S DONE.

01:04.698 --> 01:05.733
YOU'RE GOING
TO HELL.

01:05.766 --> 01:06.867
FOR THAT LITTLE PERFORMANCE,

01:06.900 --> 01:09.570
DON'T YOU THINK
I DESERVE A REWARD?

01:09.603 --> 01:10.704
(Mindy)
OH, MY GOD.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.340
WHOA, NELLY.

01:12.373 --> 01:14.542
MA'AM, YOU'VE BEEN PARKED IN
THE TURNPIKE FOR 15 MINUTES.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.544
SIR, WHAT'S THAT
AROUND YOUR NECK?

[upbeat music]

01:19.580 --> 01:27.588

01:31.392 --> 01:33.327
(Mindy)
I GOTTA LEARN.

01:33.361 --> 01:34.828
MY FRAT BUDDY,
PUBE, IS DEAD.

01:34.862 --> 01:36.230
both:
WHAT?
HE'S DEAD TO ME.

01:36.264 --> 01:37.765
BECAUSE HIS DAD
IS DEAD.

01:37.798 --> 01:39.167
AND HE'S GOTTA GO
TO THE FUNERAL,

01:39.200 --> 01:40.534
MAKING HIM UNAVAILABLE
TO BE MY PARTNER

01:40.568 --> 01:42.403
AT THE DARTMOUTH ALUMNI
BEER-PONG TOURNAMENT.

01:42.436 --> 01:43.103
I COULD BE YOUR PARTNER.

01:43.137 --> 01:44.672
I'M BASICALLY
A FRAT GUY.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.640
YOU KNOW WHY?
'CAUSE I LOVE DRINKING,

01:46.674 --> 01:48.342
AND I HATE NERDS.
BOP!

01:48.376 --> 01:49.510
I'M COOL.
NO, HE'S COOL.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.545
IT WAS FUNNY 'CAUSE LIKE
IT'S SO NOT TRUE.

01:51.579 --> 01:53.281
THANK YOU, BUT THERE'S
NO CHICKS ALLOWED.

01:53.314 --> 01:54.815
PLUS, I NEED A PARTNER
THAT'S REALLY GOOD

01:54.848 --> 01:55.816
TO BEAT LAST YEAR'S

WAIT, I THOUGHT
YOU JUST SAID

01:58.686 --> 01:59.487
THAT NO CHICKS
WERE ALLOWED.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.155
YEAH, BUT SHE'S
SUCCESSFUL LIKE A MAN.

"WHERE ARE YOU ALL?

02:05.326 --> 02:06.760
I'M REALLY PANICKED,
IF YOU CAN'T TELL."

02:06.794 --> 02:07.828
OH NO, WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE MEETING

02:07.861 --> 02:10.398
THE NEW DEPARTMENT CHIEF
AT THE HOSPITAL RIGHT NOW.

02:10.431 --> 02:11.932
I TOLD JEREMY
IF HE EVER WANTS ME

02:11.965 --> 02:13.901
TO GO ANYWHERE,
HE HAS TO TRICK ME

02:13.934 --> 02:15.803
INTO BELIEVING THAT PHARRELL

JUST SHOWED UP."
HOLY MOLY.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.509
COME ON, LET'S GO, BABE!
PETER!

NOW THAT I'VE DESCRIBED
MY VISION FOR THE HOSPITAL,

02:25.379 --> 02:26.347
A LITTLE ABOUT ME.

02:26.380 --> 02:29.650
DR. JEAN FISHMAN,
FORMERLY OF MASS GENERAL,

02:29.683 --> 02:32.553
WHERE I RAN
A VERY TIGHT SHIP.

02:32.586 --> 02:33.854
BUT I'M NOT HERE
TO MAKE FRIENDS--

OH, NO, NO, NO.

02:38.459 --> 02:39.727
[whispers]
SORRY.

02:40.961 --> 02:42.463
SO GLAD YOU GUYS
COULD MAKE IT.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.831
I HOPE IT WASN'T
TOO MUCH TROUBLE.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.533
OH, RELAX, WE'RE LIKE
THE FIRST PEOPLE HERE.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.701

ALMOST 16 MINUTES LATE.

YOU'RE LUCKY I DON'T KNOW
WHAT PRACTICE YOU'RE FROM.

OH, WE WORK
AT SHULMAN & ASSOCIATES.

A SAFE PLACE FOR WOMEN.

MAY I CONTINUE?

02:56.344 --> 02:58.479
OF COURSE. IT'S WEIRD
I'M TALKING AT ALL.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.713
SHUT UP.
OW!

02:59.747 --> 03:04.318
AS I WAS SAYING,
THERE ARE CERTAIN REFORMS

03:04.352 --> 03:06.287
THAT I WANNA PUT
IN PLACE IMMEDIATELY--

03:06.320 --> 03:08.389

I'M GONNA TURN IT OFF.

03:15.763 --> 03:16.897
JUST HOLD THIS, PLEASE.

A GOOD SONG THOUGH, RIGHT?

03:23.103 --> 03:24.037
THERE'S TOO MUCH IN HERE,
SO I THINK THE BEST THING

03:24.071 --> 03:26.574
IS JUST PROBABLY
JUST LET IT RUN ITS COURSE.

THIS TIME.

I JUST RECEIVED
THE NEW HOSPITAL SCHEDULE,

03:37.318 --> 03:38.286
AND DR. FISHMAN
HAS GIVEN US

03:38.319 --> 03:40.288
THE GRAVEYARD SLOT
FOR ALL OF OUR PROCEDURES.

03:40.321 --> 03:43.023
OH, NO, I CAN'T DO A C-SECTION
AT 11:00 P.M. ON A SUNDAY.

IDEAS, PLEASE, COME ON.
[snapping]

03:47.628 --> 03:49.297
I HAVE AN IDEA.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.432
A SINCERE APOLOGY
AND A PROMISE TO DO BETTER.

03:51.465 --> 03:53.901
I'M SORRY, WHAT'RE--
WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE, BUDDY?

03:53.934 --> 03:55.536
OH, HE'S SHADOWING ME.

IT'S LEGIT, LIKE HOW?

03:56.904 --> 03:59.039
LOOK, I CAN'T HELP
BUT FEEL PARTLY RESPONSIBLE

03:59.072 --> 04:00.574
FOR THIS.
[loudly]
BECAUSE IT'S YOUR--

04:00.608 --> 04:02.042
[lowers voice]
BECAUSE IT'S YOUR FAULT.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.043
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.579
IT'S 100% ON
YOUR SHOULDERS.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.047
OKAY, YOU DON'T ALL
HAVE TO GANG UP AGAINST ME.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.482
ALL RIGHT?
THAT'S ACTUALLY AGAINST THE LAW.

04:08.516 --> 04:10.017
LEAVE HER ALONE.
THANK YOU.

OKAY, SO WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO?

04:11.319 --> 04:12.853
I THINK I HAVE
A PRETTY GREAT IDEA.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.021
I'M GONNA TAKE
DR. FISHMAN OUT

04:14.054 --> 04:15.523
FOR A NIGHT ON THE TOWN.

YOU KNOW, GIRLS LOVE ME!
WE'LL GAB, WE'LL HANG OUT

NO! CACTUSES
MIGHT SEEM PRICKLY,

A BETTER SCHEDULE,

WHAT'D YOU HAVE
IN MIND?

05:36.537 --> 05:38.038
I HAVE NO IDEA,
BECAUSE I DID NOT THINK

05:38.071 --> 05:39.607
I WOULD GET THIS FAR.

05:39.640 --> 05:40.974
BUT IT IS GONNA
BLOW YOUR MIND.

A THOUSAND TIMES BETTER

WE'VE HAD OUR FAIR SHARE

06:14.808 --> 06:17.878
OF UPS-AND-DOWNS
SINCE I STARTED DATING LAUREN,

06:17.911 --> 06:21.148
BUT...I COULD BE
YOUR BEER-PONG PARTNER.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.716

06:22.750 --> 06:24.151
I ACTUALLY HAVE
AMAZING AIM.

06:24.184 --> 06:25.152
AS A CHILD,
IT WAS MY JOB

06:25.185 --> 06:27.455
TO PUT ICE
IN FATHER'S DRINK.

06:27.488 --> 06:30.090
AND IF I GOT TOO CLOSE,
HE WOULD SWAT AT ME.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.793
OKAY, OLIVER,
THESE STORIES ARE GETTING SO--

06:34.962 --> 06:36.997
OKAY, YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT ABOUT MAKING IT.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.432
IT'S ABOUT TECHNIQUE.

06:40.968 --> 06:42.970
ALL RIGHT, ALREADY!

06:43.003 --> 06:43.937
CLEARLY, YOU HAVE
AN AFFINITY

FOR THROWING SMALL OBJECTS
INTO SMALL GLASSES.

SUCH GOOD CHUMS.

WATCH THIS.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.519
I SINK THIS--MUAH--

06:58.552 --> 06:59.520
YOU AND I ARE PARTNERS.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.489
HAH--

07:01.522 --> 07:04.224
SO I GUESS
WE'RE PARTNERED UP.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.894
GREAT, ANOTHER ACTIVITY
I'M EXCLUDED FROM.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.899
WELL, THIS IS ME.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.734
WHOA!
SWANK.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.469
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M SAYING THIS,

07:15.503 --> 07:17.204
BUT I REALLY HAD
A GOOD TIME.

07:17.237 --> 07:19.239
EVEN WHEN YOU TRIED
TO DANCE

07:19.272 --> 07:21.074
WITH THOSE KIDS
ON THE SUBWAY.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.242
YEAH, THEY REALLY HATED IT.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.243
THEY HATED IT.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.578
IT HURT MY FEELINGS,
ACTUALLY.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.179
WE GOTTA DO THIS AGAIN
SOON THOUGH.

07:26.213 --> 07:28.215
COOL.

07:28.248 --> 07:29.950
OH...

07:32.285 --> 07:33.253
HMM, A BEETLE.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.856
OH, THANKS.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.024
THAT MEANS GOOD LUCK!

07:37.057 --> 07:39.593
[both chuckle awkwardly]

07:51.872 --> 07:53.073
MINDY, AMAZING NEWS.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.108
JEAN HAS TAKEN US
OFF THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.109
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.045
I'M SO HAPPY
THAT IT WORKED OUT.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.714
IN OTHER NEWS:
I THINK I'M GAY.
WHAT?

08:00.748 --> 08:03.216
WELL, OF COURSE HE'S GAY.
HE'S DATING DR. C.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.885
MINDY, YOU'RE NOT GAY.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.019
YOU ASKED ME
TO HELP YOU

08:06.053 --> 08:07.721
MAIL YOURSELF
TO CHRIS HEMSWORTH.

08:07.755 --> 08:09.022
YEAH, WELL, LAST NIGHT

08:09.056 --> 08:11.559
DR. FISHMAN KISSED ME
ON THE MOUTH.

08:11.592 --> 08:12.960
WAIT--WHAT?

08:12.993 --> 08:14.862
DANNY, I'M SO SORRY.
IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.063
[whispers]
DID YOU LIKE IT?

08:16.096 --> 08:17.197
DANNY CASTELLANO!

08:17.230 --> 08:18.198
[whispers]
IT'S OKAY IF YOU DID.

08:18.231 --> 08:19.600
NO, YOU PERV!

08:19.633 --> 08:20.868
SO WHAT?
SO YOU HAD A GAY EXPERIENCE.

08:20.901 --> 08:21.702
WE ALL HAVE GAY EXPERIENCES.

08:21.735 --> 08:23.671
YEAH, I ONCE KISSED
MY COUSIN SHEENA

08:23.704 --> 08:25.539
TO GET INVITED ONTO
AIR FORCE TWO.

08:25.573 --> 08:28.275
SURE, AND IF I RUN ACROSS
ONE OF RICHIE'S MEAT MAGS,

08:28.308 --> 08:30.911
I FLIP THROUGH IT,
CHECK OUT THE COMPETITION.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.279
IS THAT...NORMAL TO DO?

08:32.312 --> 08:33.814
YEAH, YOU ALWAYS
WANNA MAKE SURE

08:33.847 --> 08:34.848
THAT YOU'RE
STACKING UP.

08:34.882 --> 08:36.016
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT DID JEAN SAY

08:36.049 --> 08:37.985
WHEN YOU TOLD HER
YOU WERE STRAIGHT?

08:38.018 --> 08:39.119
I DIDN'T TELL HER.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.721
AND NOW,
JEAN HAS A CASE

08:40.754 --> 08:41.722
OF MINDY FEVER,
AND WE ALL KNOW

08:41.755 --> 08:42.723
THERE AIN'T NO CURE
FOR THAT.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.091
WAIT A MINUTE,
YOU DIDN'T TELL HER THE TRUTH?

08:44.124 --> 08:45.559
AND SHE WON'T TELL HER.
OKAY?

08:45.593 --> 08:47.060
I CAN'T GO BACK TO
3:00 A .M. DELIVERIES.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.562
MINDY, CAN'T YOU CONTINUE
BEING A LESBIAN

08:48.596 --> 08:49.897
FOR THE GOOD
OF THE GROUP?

08:49.930 --> 08:51.031
I COULD JUST BE HER FRIEND
PLATONICALLY

08:51.064 --> 08:52.199
UNTIL SHE GETS SICK OF ME--

08:52.232 --> 08:53.701
THAT USUALLY HAPPENS
REALLY FAST.
MM-HMM.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.235
OKAY, YOU'RE
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

08:55.268 --> 08:56.970
[ringtone: Divinyls'
I Touch Myself plays]
OH, MY GOD, THAT'S HER.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.171
TAKE CARE OF THIS.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.107
THAT'S THE RINGTONE
YOU GAVE HER?
YEAH.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.909
OH, HELLO, JEAN.

09:01.942 --> 09:02.910
DINNER TONIGHT?

09:02.943 --> 09:03.911
[whispering]
NO. NO.
YES!

09:03.944 --> 09:05.312
YES!
ABSOLUTELY NOT!

09:05.345 --> 09:08.181
I CAN'T, BECAUSE
I HAVE PLANS TO STAY HOME

09:08.215 --> 09:11.118
AND CATCH UP ON MY SHAVING.

09:11.151 --> 09:12.853
WHY DON'T YOU COME OVER?

09:12.886 --> 09:13.654
[whispering]
DON'T--
YES!

09:13.687 --> 09:17.157
UM, UH, I GUESS
YOU COULD COME OVER.

09:17.190 --> 09:18.358
AND I DON'T KNOW LIKE,
BRING A BOTTLE OF WINE

09:18.391 --> 09:20.327
AND WE CAN LIKE
CURL UP BY THE FIRE.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.929
BYE!
SHE'S DONE THIS BEFORE.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.096
DID YOU JUST SAY,
"CURL UP BY THE FIRE"?

09:23.130 --> 09:24.665
THAT SNOWBALLED
RATHER QUICKLY.

09:29.737 --> 09:31.705
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

09:31.739 --> 09:33.674
DO I LOOK LIKE
A BEER-PONG CHAMPION?

09:33.707 --> 09:35.776
FIRST OFF,
NEVER TWIRL AGAIN.

09:35.809 --> 09:36.777
RIGHT.

09:36.810 --> 09:37.778
SECONDLY,
I KINDA LIKE IT.

09:37.811 --> 09:38.779
YOU LOOK NORMAL.

09:38.812 --> 09:39.680
THANK YOU.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.982
I EVEN "PRE-GAMED"
AS YOU RECOMMENDED.

09:42.015 --> 09:43.751
A VERY SUBTLE
PINOT GRIGIO.

09:43.784 --> 09:44.752
OH, THAT REMINDS ME!

09:44.785 --> 09:46.854
YOU NEED A WHOLE NEW
PERSONALITY.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.055
AND A NICKNAME.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.723
I PLAYED OPHELIA
IN BOARDING SCHOOL.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.925
BARF.
YOUR NAME IS BARF.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.829
(Peter)
THIS IS SLOPPY SECONDS.

09:55.863 --> 09:57.030
THIS IS AL BUNDY.

09:57.064 --> 09:58.666
THAT'S TED BUNDY.

09:58.699 --> 09:59.833
THAT'S MY FRIEND, MLK.

09:59.867 --> 10:01.268
HEY, WHAT'S UP, LEFTY?

10:01.301 --> 10:02.836
YO, CROTCH ROT,
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

10:02.870 --> 10:03.804
(Crotch Rot)
HEY LEFTY,
WHAT'S HAPPENIN'?

10:03.837 --> 10:04.905
HOW ARE YA?

10:04.938 --> 10:06.006
WHY'S YOUR NICKNAME LEFTY?

10:06.039 --> 10:08.241
UM, I SPRAINED
MY WRIST AS A FRESHMAN

10:08.275 --> 10:10.844
WHEN I WAS YANKIN' IT,
AND THAT STORY KINDA WENT VIRAL

10:10.878 --> 10:12.713
THROUGH CAMPUS,
SO IT'S LIKE...

10:12.746 --> 10:14.815
HEY, LEFTY,
REMEMBER ME?

10:14.848 --> 10:16.383
ANDREW FREEMAN,
CLASS OF '97?

10:16.416 --> 10:18.852
CEO OF SPLODERZ
PORNOGRAPHIC WEBSITE.

10:18.886 --> 10:19.887
THAT'S RIGHT,
THESE ARE THE GUYS

10:19.920 --> 10:21.321
THAT PUT MINDY'S SEX TAPE
ONLINE.

10:21.354 --> 10:22.790
HOW'S EVERYTHING
AT MY DREAM JOB?

10:22.823 --> 10:23.623
NEVER BETTER.

10:23.657 --> 10:24.825
IN FACT, THE PROFITS
ARE ALLOWING US

10:24.858 --> 10:25.693
TO GIVE BACK THROUGH
OUR CHARITY

10:25.726 --> 10:27.761
THAT PARACHUTES PORN
INTO NORTH KOREA.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.797
OPERATION:
PEE-ONG BANG.

10:29.830 --> 10:30.998
[laughter]

10:31.031 --> 10:32.700
ZACHARY FREEMAN.

10:32.733 --> 10:33.867
I DON'T BELIEVE
WE HAVE MET.

10:33.901 --> 10:34.935
YOU HERE FOR
THE TOURNAMENT?

10:34.968 --> 10:36.937
OH, UH, UM,
MY BUDDY DOESN'T--

10:36.970 --> 10:37.938
HE'S KIND OF QUIET.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.206
[American accent]
HEY, DUDES.

10:39.239 --> 10:41.909
BARF'S THE NAME.
BEER-PONG'S MY GAME.

10:41.942 --> 10:42.976
OKAY, BRO,
I LOVE THAT!

10:43.010 --> 10:44.011
WHAT FRAT?

10:44.044 --> 10:45.979
PLEASE, IS THERE MORE
THAN ONE?

10:46.013 --> 10:46.980
SIGMA NU?

10:47.014 --> 10:47.981
YEAH.

10:48.015 --> 10:48.982
YEAH, THAT IS THE ONE.

10:49.016 --> 10:50.217
THAT IS THE ONE,
ME TOO.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.419
DON'T THINK
I REMEMBER YOU THOUGH, BRO.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.387
OH, UM...

10:54.421 --> 10:55.856
I HAD TO TAKE
THREE YEARS OFF.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.390
SEXUAL HARASSMENT THING.

10:57.424 --> 11:00.193
YEAH...

11:00.227 --> 11:02.830
I THINK I WAS
AT A FUNDRAISER

11:02.863 --> 11:03.731
FOR YOUR DEFENSE.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.866
IT WAS THE BOOZE CRUISE
THAT CAPSIZED.

11:05.899 --> 11:06.900
AH, THAT WAS
A GREAT PARTY.

11:06.934 --> 11:09.036
WAH-HOO-WAH!

11:09.069 --> 11:10.437
both:
WAH-HOO-WAH!

11:10.470 --> 11:11.438
all:
YEAH!

11:11.471 --> 11:12.706
Andrew:
ALL RIGHT, LEFTY, BARF,

11:12.740 --> 11:13.707
GREAT TO SEE YOU GUYS.

11:13.741 --> 11:14.708
GOOD LUCK
IN THE TOURNAMENT.

11:14.742 --> 11:15.776
THANKS, BROS.

11:15.809 --> 11:16.810
WE'LL SEE YOU BROS
ON THE ICE.

11:16.844 --> 11:17.778
YEAH.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.379
HEY, LEFTY,
GRAB ME A BREWKSI.

11:19.412 --> 11:21.448
I GOTTA HIT THE CAN.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.386
(Mindy)
DANNY, I AM HAVING TROUBLE
FINDING A DRESS

11:26.419 --> 11:27.821
THAT I DON'T LOOK TEMPTING IN.

11:27.855 --> 11:29.456
HEY.
WHOA.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.324
OKAY, YOU'RE FLIRTING
WITH YOUR REFLECTION AGAIN.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.392
CUT IT OUT.

11:32.425 --> 11:34.895
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
HANG OUT WITH JEAN TONIGHT.

11:34.928 --> 11:37.030
YOU HAVE TO FACE
THE CONSEQUENCES NOW, OKAY?

11:37.064 --> 11:39.066
IT'S BETTER TO DO THAT
THAN TO KEEP UP THIS LIE.

11:39.099 --> 11:40.167
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED
WITH CLIFF.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.135
DANNY, I HATE
FACING CONSEQUENCES.

11:42.169 --> 11:43.170
THAT'S WHY I HAVEN'T
OPENED MY MAIL

11:43.203 --> 11:44.137
IN LIKE TWO YEARS.

11:44.171 --> 11:45.873
YEAH, I KNOW YOU LOVE
YOUR LITTLE WHITE LIES.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.440
BUT IT'S ONE THING
TO HOLE-PUNCH

11:47.474 --> 11:48.776
YOUR OWN FREQUENT
YOGURT CARD.

11:48.809 --> 11:49.777
IT'S ANOTHER THING
TO MESS WITH

11:49.810 --> 11:51.211
SOMEONE'S HEART.

11:51.244 --> 11:52.946
FINE.
I WILL TELL THE TRUTH.

11:52.980 --> 11:55.382
BUT I'M NEVER COMING CLEAN
ABOUT MY LOOTING DURING SANDY.

11:55.415 --> 11:56.784
GOOD. NOW GET OUT
OF THAT DRESS

11:56.817 --> 11:58.285
AND PUT ON
THAT UGLY SWEAT SUIT

11:58.318 --> 11:59.787
I KEEP THROWING OUT.

11:59.820 --> 12:00.821
LET'S GO SET
THE RECORD STRAIGHT.

12:00.854 --> 12:01.855
FINE.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.758
(announcer)
IF LEFTY SINKS THIS SHOT

12:04.792 --> 12:06.860
HE'LL UNSEAT REIGNING CHAMP,
SHONDA RHIMES

12:06.894 --> 12:08.161
AND MOVE INTO THE FINALS.

12:08.195 --> 12:10.764
SINK IT DUDE!
SINK IT FOR AMERICA.

12:10.798 --> 12:11.899
FOR THE TROOPS.
FOR FREEDOM!

12:11.932 --> 12:13.400
I GOT IT.

12:17.270 --> 12:20.540
[cheering]

12:20.573 --> 12:22.375
WOO-HOO-HOO!
OH, YEAH!

12:22.409 --> 12:24.077
WHAT'S UP, SHONDA?

12:24.111 --> 12:27.280
AM I THE NEW MAYOR
OF SHONDA-LAND?

12:27.314 --> 12:29.249
GREAT GAME, LEFTY.
YOU STILL GOT IT.

12:29.282 --> 12:30.483
[British accent]
OH, MY GOD, SHONDA RHIMES,

12:30.517 --> 12:31.919
I AM OBSESSED WITH--
DUDE.

12:31.952 --> 12:34.454
WHAT'S UP? I'M BARF.
SCANDAL'S MY JAM.

12:34.487 --> 12:36.556
THANKS. YOU KNOW,
WRITING'S HOW I PAY THE BILLS,

12:36.589 --> 12:37.858
BUT MY PASSION IS BEER-PONG.

12:37.891 --> 12:38.959
NATURALLY.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.527
LEFTY, I HEARD
YOUR GOOD NEWS.

12:40.560 --> 12:41.528
YOU'RE DATING
THAT BRAIN SURGEON?

12:41.561 --> 12:43.931
OH, UH, PFFT,
LAUREN?

12:43.964 --> 12:45.532
WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY
TOGETHER ANYMORE.

12:45.565 --> 12:47.100
BUT IT'S OKAY,
I MEAN,

12:47.134 --> 12:48.936
I HARDLY EVEN CRY
ABOUT HER IN THE TUB.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.905
SHE LEFT YOUR HAIRY ASS,
DIDN'T SHE, LEFTY?

12:51.939 --> 12:54.141
OH, IT HAPPENED
AGAIN?

12:54.174 --> 12:56.276
YOU KNOW, THIS TIME,
WE BROKE UP MUTUALLY, SO--

12:56.309 --> 12:58.178
OH, MAN!
I CALLED IT!

12:58.211 --> 12:59.880
CLASSIC LEFTY!

12:59.913 --> 13:02.515
HA HA!
LEFTY! LEFTY!

13:02.549 --> 13:05.152
[all chanting: "Lefty!"]

13:05.185 --> 13:06.153
CLASSIC LEFTY!

13:06.186 --> 13:07.287
SHONDA.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.823
LEFTY, LEFTY, LEFTY,
LEFTY!

13:09.857 --> 13:11.491
YOU KNOW, I WROTE A TV PILOT
ABOUT HIM ONCE.

13:11.524 --> 13:14.895
NETWORK SAID IT WAS TOO SAD.

13:14.928 --> 13:16.363
(Mindy)
HEY JEAN.

13:16.396 --> 13:17.931
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

13:17.965 --> 13:20.000
I'M KIND OF BUSY.
CAN WE TALK ABOUT IT LATER?

13:20.033 --> 13:22.602
NO, NO. ACTUALLY, I NEED
TO GET THIS OFF OF MY CHEST.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.337
LOOK,
YOU'RE AN AMAZING KISSER.

13:24.371 --> 13:25.839
YOU HAVE THE SOFTNESS
OF A WOMAN

13:25.873 --> 13:27.875
BUT THE STRENGTH
OF A MAN.

13:27.908 --> 13:28.909
I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING
ABOUT IT

13:28.942 --> 13:31.945
LATER IN THE BATH
AND I--

13:31.979 --> 13:34.547
THE PROBLEM IS
I'M STRAIGHT.

13:34.581 --> 13:36.583
AND I'M SORRY
IF I LED YOU ON.

13:36.616 --> 13:37.584
WOW.

13:37.617 --> 13:38.585
IN RETROSPECT,
I COULD SEE HOW

13:38.618 --> 13:41.955
OUR NUDE COUPLES MASSAGE
WOULD'VE CONFUSED YOU.

13:41.989 --> 13:43.957
OR WHEN I ASKED YOU
TO CHECK MY BREASTS

13:43.991 --> 13:46.359
TO MAKE SURE
THAT THEY WERE SYMMETRICAL.
WHAT?

13:46.393 --> 13:48.595
BUT MOSTLY,
I REGRET THAT I LET YOU KISS ME.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.898
WHAT?
YOU KISSED HER?

13:50.931 --> 13:52.399
EXCUSE ME, SIR,
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE

13:52.432 --> 13:53.901

I CAN'T BELIEVE

14:02.342 --> 14:03.911
THAT YOU'VE BEEN KEEPING
THIS LITTLE BUTCH

14:03.944 --> 14:05.478
AND HER GIRLFRIEND
ON THE SIDE!
EXCUSE ME?

14:05.512 --> 14:07.547
I AM NOT BUTCH.
I'M A LIPSTICK LESBIAN.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.449
I MEAN,
I'M A STRAIGHT WOMAN.
SHE'S STRAIGHT.

14:09.482 --> 14:10.650
HERE'S THE DEAL, OKAY?
WHAT?

14:10.683 --> 14:11.952
I'M A MASCULINE WOMAN,

14:11.985 --> 14:13.353
AND THIS IS
AN EFFEMINATE MAN.
WHAT?

14:13.386 --> 14:15.288
THE LIPS, THE LASHES--
IT'S A LITTLE MUCH, I KNOW.

14:15.322 --> 14:17.224

I'M A MAN!

14:17.257 --> 14:18.558
I'M A MAN,
AND THAT'S MY GIRLFRIEND!

14:18.591 --> 14:20.127
LET'S ALL JUST RELAX HERE,
OKAY?

14:20.160 --> 14:21.228
SHE IS DEFINITELY STRAIGHT.

14:21.261 --> 14:22.495
SHE DOESN'T DO
ALL THE THINGS

14:22.529 --> 14:23.931
THAT STRAIGHT GIRLS DO,
BUT SHE'S STRAIGHT.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.132
OKAY, YOU'RE VERY
WELL TAKEN CARE OF.

14:25.165 --> 14:26.399
I'M SORRY, DEBORAH,
THAT THIS HAPPENED.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.401
DEB-DEB,
IF SHE HAD MENTIONED YOU

14:28.435 --> 14:30.137
BUT ONCE IN OUR FIVE-HOUR DATE,

14:30.170 --> 14:32.272
I WOULDN'T HAVE
LET HER KISS ME.

14:33.941 --> 14:35.542
DEB-DEB!

14:35.575 --> 14:37.244
I AM GOING TO RE-DO

SEE THE SUN AGAIN!

THE TRUTH SUCKS!

OH, THERE YOU ARE.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.319
WOULD YOU BURP ME?

14:46.353 --> 14:49.256
CAN YOU PLEASE LEAVE
BETH AND I ALONE?

14:49.289 --> 14:51.024
IS THIS ABOUT THE LEFTY THING?

14:51.058 --> 14:53.026
IT'S JUST A NICKNAME, BUDDY.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.095
LIKE WHEN FATHER CALLS ME
"NOT-MINE."

14:55.128 --> 14:57.097
WHO KNOWS
WHAT IT MEANS?

14:57.130 --> 14:59.632
DO YOU KNOW WHY
THEY CALL ME LEFTY?

14:59.666 --> 15:01.701
BECAUSE EVERY GIRL I LOVE
ALWAYS LEAVES ME,

15:01.734 --> 15:03.603
AND THEY ALWAYS LEAVE ME
FOR ONE OF MY FRIENDS.

15:03.636 --> 15:06.974
DOES THAT SOUND
FAMILIAR TO YOU, DR. REED?

15:07.007 --> 15:08.675
WELL, WHY DID YOU
INVITE ME THEN?

15:08.708 --> 15:10.377
BECAUSE I WANT TO WIN.

15:10.410 --> 15:14.047
I DON'T WANT TO BE KNOWN
AS JUST A DUMPED CHUMP.

AND STARTED THE PETER PARTY.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.189
I DO LOVE ALLITERATION.

OKAY, IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO LEAD US TO VICTORY.

BYE, DANNY.
BYE-BYE NOW.

21:30.590 --> 21:33.426
THAT IS HOW IT'S DONE.
