Previously on Beauty and the Beast:

00:03.600 --> 00:06.365
Liam killed my sister, all right?
He's an animal, all right?

00:06.520 --> 00:09.683
- We've got to stop him.
- I don't do this because I want to.

00:09.840 --> 00:13.811
I do this because I can't risk
anybody else being enhanced.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.161
What's the matter?

00:22.320 --> 00:24.402
My boyfriend still has
a superhuman target on his back

00:24.560 --> 00:25.846
and beasts are back in our lives.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.843
No wonder Julianna wanted
to capture Vincent.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.321
She thought only a beast
could stop a beast.

00:30.480 --> 00:32.561
A superhuman beast,
let's not forget.

00:32.720 --> 00:34.210
Yeah.

00:34.360 --> 00:38.649
Sensing a beast again for the first time
in a very long time,

00:39.160 --> 00:41.925
it made me feel like I used to.

00:42.080 --> 00:43.570
Like what?

00:43.720 --> 00:47.167
Like a predator out for my kill.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.444
All right, come on, we gotta move fast.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.443
Really?
You think I'm choosing this speed?

00:55.600 --> 00:57.090
- No, I gotta keep you moving.
- This is crazy.

00:57.240 --> 00:58.480
How long can we keep this up?

00:58.640 --> 01:01.564
- As long as it takes.
- No, I'm serious, Vincent.

01:01.720 --> 01:04.325
I've been bounced around from
safe house to safe house for days

01:04.480 --> 01:07.768
and since I'm the last serum-enhanced
person left on the list,

01:07.920 --> 01:11.129
you know it's only a matter of time
before Liam finds me.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.408
Okay, I will not let Liam find you,
all right?

01:13.560 --> 01:16.928
But aren't you a little more concerned
now that you know he's a beast too?

01:17.080 --> 01:20.721
- What do you mean?
- I mean, you know what I mean.

01:20.880 --> 01:23.201
You thought we were done with beasts
just as much as I did.

01:23.360 --> 01:26.443
- Doesn't this bring up issues?
- You've been talking to Catherine?

01:26.600 --> 01:28.523
No.

01:28.680 --> 01:30.409
She might've mentioned
something about it.

01:30.560 --> 01:34.281
Well, whatever. I got caught off-guard
when I first found out, you know?

01:34.440 --> 01:37.523
I got a little out of control
but it won't happen again.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.206
Still, Liam can get to you
in ways no one else can.

01:40.360 --> 01:41.521
Primal ways.

01:41.680 --> 01:43.842
Okay, that was before
I knew he was a beast.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.402
Besides, I've already proven that I can
keep myself from going primal,

01:47.560 --> 01:49.961
- thank you very much.
- Once, maybe.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.721
But I like the confidence, I do.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.882
By the way, any luck finding the gem?

01:56.040 --> 01:58.725
Be nice to keep
his beast side in check.

01:58.880 --> 02:00.609
J.T., I went to the dungeon,
it's not there.

02:00.760 --> 02:02.649

I swore I hid it there.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.962
You didn't. Until you find out
where you did hide it,

02:05.120 --> 02:07.043

- Ah, Sarah's wedding was awesome.

02:32.040 --> 02:33.565
But I'd hold off on buying her
a gift

02:33.720 --> 02:35.848

the marriage is gonna last.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.764

02:37.920 --> 02:41.322
Yeah.
So you owe me 86 bucks in cab fare.

- You're a big tipper.
- Are you mad?

02:43.680 --> 02:45.728
In the old days, yes,
but now that I know everything

02:45.880 --> 02:47.769
that you're dealing with the--

02:47.920 --> 02:49.206
- Beasts?
- Shh.

something happen while I was away?

Other than trying to stop
a superhuman maniac?

02:56.440 --> 02:58.522
Who also happens to be a beast.

02:58.680 --> 03:00.523
What? You mean Liam?

03:00.680 --> 03:03.411
- You mean he's like Vincent?
- No, he is not.

03:03.560 --> 03:06.006
- But you just said he was...
- It's not the same thing.

03:06.160 --> 03:11.007
Liam is a lost cause, he's crossed
the primal line, and Vincent hasn't.

03:11.160 --> 03:13.925
- But you're worried he could?
- No, of course not.

03:15.160 --> 03:18.243
Okay. I mean, I wasn't worried,

03:18.400 --> 03:20.801
but after we found out about Liam,
I think that Vincent is.

03:22.160 --> 03:25.004
I wish there was a way to put
this worry to bed once and for all.

03:25.160 --> 03:28.050
Well, I think it's silly that you're
worrying about it at all anymore.

03:28.200 --> 03:31.363
You and Vincent have come so far,
you're not gonna lose him to that.

03:33.120 --> 03:36.044
Although, I must say,
the fact that Liam is a beast

03:36.200 --> 03:38.646
might just tie in perfectly
with this whole destiny thing.

03:39.160 --> 03:40.207
Sorry?

03:40.360 --> 03:42.601
I looked into your ancestor Rebecca
while I was in London

03:42.760 --> 03:46.845
and apparently Alistair
wasn't the only beast in 1854,

03:47.000 --> 03:49.685
although the newspapers called them
"monsters" back then.

03:49.840 --> 03:51.490
Okay, what does
that have to do with...?

03:51.640 --> 03:54.450
Rebecca and Alistair were up against
a beast back then

03:54.600 --> 03:56.443
when they were engaged,
and now you and Vincent

03:56.600 --> 03:58.728
are up against another one,
now, engaged.

04:00.040 --> 04:03.886
Buy you a cup of coffee?
Or would you prefer to arrest me now?

04:04.040 --> 04:06.771

- This must be your sister.

04:07.960 --> 04:09.485

04:09.640 --> 04:11.290
Leave her alone, Liam.

- Liam?
- What do you want?

04:13.840 --> 04:15.410
I wanna talk, in private.

04:15.560 --> 04:17.642
And seeing as how
I'm a wanted man,

04:17.800 --> 04:20.007
I figured the best way would be
for you to arrest me.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.891
Or I could just kill everyone here.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.490
Aren't you gonna read me my rights?

04:31.640 --> 04:34.007

04:36.200 --> 04:37.281
Well, I told him to come.

Not in so many words, of course,
but beast to beast.

04:41.280 --> 04:44.523
It's like dog hearing.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.120
You wouldn't understand.

04:48.040 --> 04:50.930
Don't be scared. If I wanted to kill you,
Catherine, I would have by now.

04:51.080 --> 04:53.765
Besides, hurting you
would only anger Vincent,

04:53.920 --> 04:55.365
and I wouldn't wanna do that,
would I?

04:55.520 --> 04:57.045
What do you want?

It's a beautiful thing. I envy that.

05:11.920 --> 05:15.686
You give rne one good reason why
I shouldn't end you here, right now.

05:15.840 --> 05:18.764
You think you can?
I don't think so.

05:18.920 --> 05:20.649
But it'd be a hell of a battle,
wouldn't it?

05:20.800 --> 05:24.885

for perhaps the last two beasts alive.

you and I.

- No, we're nothing alike.

- You're a cold-blooded killer, Liam.
- And you're not?

05:33.640 --> 05:35.768
Tell me, Vincent, how many people
have you killed?

05:35.920 --> 05:39.083
It's not the same thing.
Vincent doesn't kill innocent people.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.561
- He doesn't blow hospitals up.
- A kill is a kill.

05:41.720 --> 05:43.051

him from being more like rne is you.

Look, there's nothing I can do.

06:34.200 --> 06:36.680
- But why?
- You ever hear of the Ellingsworihs?

06:36.840 --> 06:39.411
- Yeah, the philanthropists.
- They are protecting Liam.

06:39.560 --> 06:42.404
They even used their influence
to block his extradition to Interpol

06:42.560 --> 06:44.483
so there is no way the DA
is touching this.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.847

protect Liam?

- They're saints and he's...
- Using them.

- Obviously.
- And not just to get out of jail.

an end game, right?

got to figure out what he wants.

Fortunately, DHS hasn't identified it
as prom-beast yet

they'll expose me as a beast.

our country, but in others too.

36:00.840 --> 36:05.209
- Maybe you ought to try telling Helen.
- That Liam is her ancestor? How?

36:05.360 --> 36:06.964
He destroyed the blood samples

36:07.120 --> 36:09.327
and besides, I highly doubt
that she would believe that.

36:10.360 --> 36:11.725
Right.

36:11.880 --> 36:14.008
Did you figure out
what Liam wants with them?

36:14.160 --> 36:16.891
No. No, but I can sense revenge.

36:17.040 --> 36:21.204
Specifically what or how, I don't know,
but it certainly drives the guy.

36:21.360 --> 36:23.840
Because Rebecca rejected him
all those decades ago?

36:24.000 --> 36:26.321
- What's the connection?
- Well, maybe none.

36:26.480 --> 36:29.450
You know, I get the feeling
that his pain precedes Rebecca.

36:29.600 --> 36:31.284
It's more primal or something.

36:31.440 --> 36:33.841
If it was my guess, I would say
it has to do with his family.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.241
Well, according to their genealogy,
if it's the same kid,

36:36.400 --> 36:38.528
they abandoned him and put him
in an orphanage.

36:38.680 --> 36:41.081
Probably after they found out
what his other half really was.

36:41.240 --> 36:44.084
Even so, Helen's not responsible
for what her relatives may have done

36:44.240 --> 36:46.527
back in the 1800s.

36:46.680 --> 36:48.682
Fruit of the poisoned tree.

36:49.280 --> 36:51.009
Who knows?

36:51.160 --> 36:52.889
Well, we've got to figure it out soon

36:53.040 --> 36:54.804
because now that Liam knows
he can't turn you,

36:54.960 --> 36:56.962
he's gonna have to escalate
whatever he's planning.

36:57.120 --> 36:59.122
Now, that is a tomorrow problem.

37:03.600 --> 37:07.161
Do you wanna go, uh,
maybe take a walk?

37:08.240 --> 37:09.480
Yeah, sure.

37:09.640 --> 37:12.450
Um, hey, can you do me a favour?
If Tess calls, let me know.

37:12.600 --> 37:14.443
She went to see J.T.
I wanna make sure she's okay.

37:14.600 --> 37:17.490
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

37:20.320 --> 37:21.367
[SIGHS]

37:30.160 --> 37:33.607
Why didn't you tell me?
Why would you hide this from me?

37:34.880 --> 37:38.407
- I didn't wanna worry you.
- Bull.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.403
It is.

37:40.560 --> 37:41.686
Come on, tell me why.

37:41.840 --> 37:45.083
I guess I just don't wanna be weak
around you, okay?

37:45.240 --> 37:47.083
I don't. I mean, let's face it.

37:47.240 --> 37:50.369
You started liking me,
really started liking me,

37:50.520 --> 37:53.729
- when you thought I was...
- Superhuman?

37:53.880 --> 37:55.803
- Yeah.
- That's-- That's crazy.

37:55.960 --> 37:58.247
I never cared--
What is the matter with you?

37:58.680 --> 38:01.251
What's the matter with me?
I'm dying, Tess.

38:01.400 --> 38:04.927
Look, maybe,
but I never cared about that, never.

38:05.080 --> 38:07.811
I love you. I never cared about
whether you could hit a bull's eye

38:07.960 --> 38:11.442
or see without your glasses
or leap tall buildings, never.

38:11.600 --> 38:14.001
I care about you. I love you.

38:14.200 --> 38:15.486
[SCOFFS]

38:15.640 --> 38:18.723
I love you too, okay?

38:18.880 --> 38:21.406
[SOBBING] Then don't push me away
when you're hurting, okay?

38:21.560 --> 38:22.800
Okay.

38:25.200 --> 38:26.804
- Okay.
- Okay.

38:28.240 --> 38:31.403
Look, it's not like this is the first time
we've gone through this.

38:31.560 --> 38:35.007
I thought I lost you once and I didn't.
You were saved.

38:35.160 --> 38:37.731
Yeah, by the very same serum
that's killing me now.

38:37.880 --> 38:39.962
I've gone over and over again.

38:40.120 --> 38:43.203
The same T-cells that accelerated
my healing are now accelerating--

38:43.360 --> 38:45.010
J.T., we'll figure it out.

38:46.760 --> 38:48.410
I can't lose you.

38:53.320 --> 38:55.482
Come on,
how worried were you, really?

38:55.640 --> 38:58.371
I told you, only at first.

38:58.520 --> 39:01.251
I knew that you'd be tested
and that I'd have no control over it.

39:01.400 --> 39:04.131
Yeah, well, it was the first time
the test involved a beast.

39:04.280 --> 39:06.806
- And not just any beast.
- I know.

39:06.960 --> 39:09.804
And then I started to think
that it was a test for me too.

39:09.960 --> 39:13.328
To see if I could be myself,

39:13.480 --> 39:16.165
not make all my choices based
on worrying about it all the time,

39:16.320 --> 39:18.049
worrying about you.

39:18.200 --> 39:19.804
Come on, you don't worry about me
anymore?

39:19.960 --> 39:21.450
No. Heh.

39:21.600 --> 39:26.288
I mean, now I'm worried about you
outliving me by a few hundred years.

39:26.440 --> 39:28.283
How about you? Are you worried?

39:28.440 --> 39:31.603
You know what? No.
That's what I wanted to tell you.

39:31.760 --> 39:34.411
Neither of us have to worry
about that anymore.

39:34.560 --> 39:36.528
So, Liam did us a favour
trying to tear us apart

39:36.680 --> 39:37.886
He made us stronger.

39:38.040 --> 39:39.963
That's not the only favour
that he did us.

39:40.120 --> 39:42.009
You know, he tipped his hand.

39:42.160 --> 39:45.050
If he was so afraid of us
stopping him together,

39:45.200 --> 39:47.680
then we know
that means that we can.

39:47.840 --> 39:49.968
Yeah,
we just have to figure out how.

39:50.120 --> 39:51.326
It can't be a coincidence

39:51.480 --> 39:54.723
that the beast who killed Rebecca
and Alistair is back in our lives, can it?

39:54.880 --> 39:58.362
Either way,
we can't let history repeat itself.
