"Dear diary...

00:06.336 --> 00:10.336
"Hmm. "

00:12.496 --> 00:15.495
Yeah.

00:15.496 --> 00:18.375
Go. I don't think I'm strong enough
to make it on my own!

00:18.376 --> 00:21.775
Give it a go. You've got your mum,
all your friends. Please, please.

00:21.776 --> 00:24.575
"There is a difference
between snacking and bingeing. "

00:24.576 --> 00:26.455
If that's how you feel, maybe...

00:26.456 --> 00:29.135
we shouldn't be friends.

00:29.136 --> 00:31.935
Oh! I'm pregnant.

00:31.936 --> 00:34.615
Being dead nice to me,
then just doing something rude...

00:34.616 --> 00:35.895
I'm not trying to be heavy.

00:35.896 --> 00:37.215
I don't want to be your friend.

00:37.216 --> 00:39.056
There is always, always,
always a way out.

00:41.656 --> 00:45.656
I'm actually mad. I think
you're ready to start therapy.

00:53.336 --> 00:54.576
"Dear Tix...

00:54.661 --> 00:57.820
"First of all, my diary is full.

00:57.821 --> 01:01.020
"But who needs a diary
when I can write to you, fatty?

01:01.021 --> 01:02.900
"And second of all,

01:02.901 --> 01:05.379
"I've got loads to tell you.

01:05.381 --> 01:08.460
"This summer seems to be
going on forever.

01:08.461 --> 01:12.461
"Like the heat of the sun
is warping time itself.

01:14.061 --> 01:15.901
"So, I'm still here. "

01:21.021 --> 01:22.780
"And so's Archie.

01:22.781 --> 01:26.781
"And he's still gorgeous.

01:28.421 --> 01:32.421
"Chop and Izzy
are still inseparable...

01:34.901 --> 01:37.020
"And Chloe's still,

01:37.021 --> 01:41.021
"well, Chloe.

01:41.861 --> 01:44.900
"And thanks to Karim,
my mum's happy too.

01:44.901 --> 01:48.901
"Sometimes, we even look
vaguely like a normal family. "

01:56.301 --> 01:57.820
"We're all untouchable.

01:57.821 --> 02:01.821
"And, Tixy, I've got this feeling
that I'm not used to.

02:01.941 --> 02:05.941
"It fizzes like cherry cola
and tingles like kisses on my neck.

02:06.021 --> 02:08.220
"I think it's called happiness. "

02:08.221 --> 02:10.100
Hey, hey, hey!

02:10.101 --> 02:14.101
Welcome drink.

02:16.221 --> 02:17.300
"Oh...

02:17.301 --> 02:21.301
"I guess there's one person
I've not mentioned.

02:21.541 --> 02:24.300
"My Finn.

02:24.301 --> 02:27.660
"I don't even know where to start.

02:27.661 --> 02:31.661
"All I can say is that, well,
a lot is going on.

02:34.261 --> 02:38.261
"I suppose I'd better begin
at the beginning. "

03:17.901 --> 03:20.180
"It was the day after
my mum's wedding.

03:20.181 --> 03:24.181
"Chloe had assembled everyone
so we could talk about me being ill.

03:24.661 --> 03:27.340
"She was trying to help,
but I wanted someone

03:27.341 --> 03:28.980
"to put a bullet in my head. "

03:28.981 --> 03:31.220
Right, OK, so when you have
the ketchup bottle,

03:31.221 --> 03:32.820
you can ask Rae
a question about it.

03:32.821 --> 03:36.700
Maybe we can just talk about it
whenever people want?

03:36.701 --> 03:37.860
Yeah, why can't we do that?

03:37.861 --> 03:40.300
Cos this is a good way of
getting everything out there.

03:40.301 --> 03:42.580
And because this is how
we're doing it. All right?

03:42.581 --> 03:45.860
"It was agony.
But at least Finn wasn't there.

03:45.861 --> 03:48.140
"I didn't want him
thinking I was still ill...

03:48.141 --> 03:49.741
"Fuck!"

03:51.701 --> 03:55.140
Where have you been?
Er, soz, Mum!

03:55.141 --> 03:57.180
Afternoon. Afternoon.

03:57.181 --> 03:59.780
Well, I'll go first.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.780
When they took you into hospital,

04:01.781 --> 04:05.781
did they proper drag you out,
like, and put you in a van? No.

04:06.461 --> 04:10.020
I was already in hospital,
because I'd hurt myself.

04:10.021 --> 04:13.620
So, it was voluntary? Actually,
you don't have the ketchup bottle.

04:13.621 --> 04:17.620
Don't speak if you don't have
the ketchup bottle.

04:17.661 --> 04:19.180
So, it was voluntary?

04:19.180 --> 04:21.180
They said they'd agreed it
with my mum

04:21.180 --> 04:24.300
and then they asked me
what I wanted to do,

04:24.301 --> 04:28.301
but I think they'd have
made me stay anyway.

04:30.701 --> 04:33.060
You're all right now, though?

04:33.061 --> 04:34.700
Are you?

04:34.701 --> 04:37.540
Yes.

04:37.541 --> 04:39.901
I'm better.

04:45.181 --> 04:48.740
"We met that night, Tixy.
Just him and me.

04:48.741 --> 04:52.741
"We hadn't said it was a date,
but it definitely was a date. "

04:55.341 --> 04:57.020
"By the way,

04:57.021 --> 04:59.820
"his arse is so beautiful
that sometimes,

04:59.821 --> 05:03.821
"I have to stop myself from crying
when I look at it. "

05:10.181 --> 05:12.500
Not too shabby, Findlay.

05:12.501 --> 05:14.220
Right, you're up.

05:14.221 --> 05:16.620
Are you sure you don't want
the bumpers up?

05:16.621 --> 05:19.500
No, I'll be all right.

05:19.501 --> 05:23.501
Aim just to the left or the right of
the centre one, yeah?

05:24.941 --> 05:28.941
Just try and hit 'em.

05:41.701 --> 05:43.820
I thought you said
you'd never played before!

05:43.821 --> 05:45.260
I say a lot of things.

05:45.261 --> 05:49.261
That's how it's going to be, is it?
That's how it's going to be.

05:50.941 --> 05:53.180
"I was in heaven, Tix.

05:53.181 --> 05:57.181
"It was the greatest date
in the history of dating. "

05:58.661 --> 06:01.380
It's been two days
and he still hasn't called.

06:01.381 --> 06:04.740
I'm such an idiot!
It clearly wasn't a date.

06:04.741 --> 06:08.741
I thought it might not be a date.
You guys hang out all the time.

06:08.941 --> 06:12.340
Have you even kissed yet? No.
I don't think it was a date.

06:12.341 --> 06:15.940
What about what he wrote
on your back? He must like you.

06:15.941 --> 06:17.780
Yeah, well,
the thing with that was...

06:17.781 --> 06:19.580
I'd had three Tia Marias.

06:19.581 --> 06:23.581
So maybe he actually wrote something
really weird, like...

06:24.261 --> 06:25.860
"I'm an emu. "

06:25.861 --> 06:29.300
Rae... Oh... Maybe you're right
about what he wrote,

06:29.301 --> 06:30.900
but he meant it as a friend.

06:30.901 --> 06:32.700
I don't want him as a friend.

06:32.701 --> 06:36.701
I want him to go down on me for
so long that he has to evolve gills.

06:38.301 --> 06:41.620
All right, calm down...

06:41.621 --> 06:44.940
and drink some of your coke.

06:44.941 --> 06:48.300
I think I might know why he hasn't
been in touch, Rae. Why?

06:48.301 --> 06:50.740
It's because you beat him
at bowling. What?

06:50.741 --> 06:53.180
Men don't like being beaten
at sports.

06:53.181 --> 06:57.181
Do they not? No, seriously. They
feel like it, um, emasculates them.

06:57.701 --> 06:59.220
I read it in Just Seventeen.

06:59.221 --> 07:01.100
What am I going to do?

07:01.101 --> 07:03.740
My relationship is over
and it hasn't even begun.

07:03.741 --> 07:05.420
No, no, calm down.

07:05.421 --> 07:06.980
You need to be in a situation
with him

07:06.981 --> 07:09.980
where he can show you that
he's manly. Mm-hm.

07:09.981 --> 07:13.860
You know? Where he can show you
that he is strong...

07:13.861 --> 07:14.980
and he is fierce.

07:14.981 --> 07:17.340
Yeah. Fierce.

07:17.341 --> 07:20.141
What you need to do. Yeah.

07:21.701 --> 07:25.380
That's it, run! Yeah, go on! Kick!

07:25.381 --> 07:28.220
You can score a goal!

07:28.221 --> 07:30.980
I know you're tired,
but you can do it!

07:30.981 --> 07:32.780
Woo!

07:32.781 --> 07:36.781
Loving your work, Finn!
Loving your work!

07:39.181 --> 07:43.181
Oh, no.

07:48.661 --> 07:50.660
It stinks in here.

07:50.661 --> 07:54.661
They add that boy smell, so you know
you're in a changing room!

07:55.141 --> 07:59.141
You looked good out there.
Proper manly.

07:59.781 --> 08:03.781
You say the weirdest stuff sometimes!

08:03.821 --> 08:05.540
You do.

08:05.541 --> 08:07.700
You don't think I'm weird,
though, do you?

08:07.701 --> 08:11.540
No. I don't want you
to think I'm weird

08:11.541 --> 08:14.500
by asking if you think I'm weird.
By the way, I'm not paranoid

08:14.501 --> 08:18.340
about stuff like that,
I'm not some kind of person...

08:18.341 --> 08:22.341
"Oh, my God!"

08:25.901 --> 08:29.060
You don't have to kiss me
because you feel sorry for me.

08:29.061 --> 08:32.780
I'm not kissing you
cos I feel sorry for you.

08:32.780 --> 08:36.059
I'm kissing you because I want to.

08:36.061 --> 08:40.061
And also, maybe to shut you up
a little bit.

08:46.701 --> 08:50.540
"And that was our first kiss,
amongst the dirty socks,

08:50.541 --> 08:54.541
"with the smell of sweat and dirt,
both of us covered in blood.

08:56.221 --> 08:58.260
"It was perfect.

08:58.261 --> 09:02.261
"PS - in your face, Chloe,
I knew it was a date!

09:05.261 --> 09:08.420
"And that brings me back
to the present day,

09:08.421 --> 09:12.220
"Where you will find Finn,
with his index...

09:12.221 --> 09:14.820
".. and middle finger upon
my lady area. "

09:14.821 --> 09:17.140
You all right?

09:17.141 --> 09:20.300
Good?

09:20.301 --> 09:22.060
"What if I can't relax?

09:22.061 --> 09:25.060
"What if I get so nervous that
my vagina turns to stone

09:25.061 --> 09:26.580
"and I can't feel anything?

09:26.581 --> 09:29.980
"Or even worse, what if Finn
didn't know what he was doing?

09:29.981 --> 09:33.981
"I had hours and days and weeks
of experience in the lady area,

09:34.621 --> 09:35.820
"I knew how it operated.

09:35.821 --> 09:38.420
"What if I had to fake an orgasm?

09:38.421 --> 09:40.260
"How the hell do you fake
an orgasm?!

09:40.261 --> 09:41.980
"What if he couldn't find my...?"

09:41.981 --> 09:44.860
Oh! Holy Lord Jesus Christ!

09:44.861 --> 09:47.460
Fuck. Shh.

09:47.461 --> 09:51.260
Feel good?

09:51.261 --> 09:53.820
It's all right, yeah.

09:53.821 --> 09:57.540
"This is heaven.
I'm actually in heaven.

09:57.541 --> 10:00.980
"He's using his thumb to tap.

10:00.981 --> 10:04.981
"Oh, my God! He's a sex wizard!"

10:26.031 --> 10:28.310
Oh, hi, Finn.
I didn't know you were here.

10:28.311 --> 10:29.990
Hiya.

10:29.991 --> 10:33.151
What you doing, Rae?
What do you want, Mum?

10:33.188 --> 10:34.627
We're having a hotpot for tea,

10:34.628 --> 10:36.387
so I need you to run down to
the corner shop

10:36.388 --> 10:38.227
and get me some red cabbage.

10:38.228 --> 10:40.867
You burst in here
because of red cabbage?

10:40.868 --> 10:43.747
You can't have a hotpot without
red cabbage, can you, Finn?

10:43.748 --> 10:45.547
No. No, you can't, no.

10:45.548 --> 10:47.307
Are you staying for tea, lovely?

10:47.308 --> 10:51.308
No, I've got football.
Thanks, though.

10:56.028 --> 10:59.947
Guys, I'm happy.

10:59.948 --> 11:03.948
I'm so happy.

11:05.548 --> 11:07.467
I'm sorry...

11:07.468 --> 11:11.147
I'm a bit emotional at the moment.

11:11.148 --> 11:14.347
I think I'm going through changes.

11:14.348 --> 11:15.907
You know, Finn?

11:15.908 --> 11:18.267
Changes.

11:18.268 --> 11:22.268
Yeah. My mum went through her changes
early as well.

11:24.628 --> 11:28.628
Sorry.

11:32.148 --> 11:36.148
Red cabbage.

11:37.948 --> 11:41.948
Is she all right?
Yeah, ignore her, she's a weirdo.

11:42.228 --> 11:46.228
Look, I've got to get to football.
Oh, but...

11:46.508 --> 11:50.507
"And then he said it, Tix.
Three little words.

11:50.508 --> 11:54.387
"No, not I love you. Even better. "

11:54.388 --> 11:58.388
To... be... continued.

11:59.948 --> 12:02.505
"And there go my ovaries!"

12:04.442 --> 12:06.302
I'm happy.

12:06.358 --> 12:08.558
Yeah?

12:08.563 --> 12:12.563
Yeah. Good.

12:13.923 --> 12:16.722
How's the diary?

12:16.723 --> 12:20.723
Look, don't be mad,
but I've stopped it.

12:23.556 --> 12:24.675
It's your diary.

12:24.676 --> 12:27.456
It was useful when I was struggling,

12:27.532 --> 12:30.432
but I'm not...

12:30.487 --> 12:34.487
so... it's not.

12:36.007 --> 12:38.926
There's a couple of things
I wanted to talk to you about.

12:38.927 --> 12:42.166
The first thing is, I run
a group therapy session once a week,

12:42.167 --> 12:44.486
and I think it would be
really good for you.

12:44.487 --> 12:46.686
Just so you know you're not alone.

12:46.687 --> 12:48.686
Nah.

12:48.687 --> 12:51.366
Danny goes.

12:51.367 --> 12:53.286
I know he'd love to see you there.

12:53.287 --> 12:57.287
I think he misses you and he could
do with cheering up right now.

12:57.487 --> 13:01.487
We all could.

13:01.967 --> 13:05.406
Well, just say
you'll think about it.

13:05.407 --> 13:08.486
I'll think about it.

13:08.487 --> 13:11.246
The other thing I wanted to say...

13:11.247 --> 13:14.446
I think there's something
we've been avoiding talking about.

13:14.447 --> 13:17.167
I think we both know what that is.

13:21.447 --> 13:23.486
Oh.

13:23.487 --> 13:27.487
Time's up.

13:28.407 --> 13:32.407
See ya!

13:34.567 --> 13:37.686
So I guess you girls are
planning on doing you-know-what?

13:37.687 --> 13:39.766
I haven't really thought about
my first time.

13:39.767 --> 13:42.566
But I want it to be perfect.

13:42.567 --> 13:45.966
I want it to be in a big four-poster
bed with white satin sheets,

13:45.967 --> 13:49.086
and Chop's lit some candles
and put some rose petals down,

13:49.087 --> 13:50.806
and he's opened a bottle of wine,

13:50.807 --> 13:53.326
but the butler only brought
one glass, so we have to share.

13:53.327 --> 13:55.086
Butler? Yeah.

13:55.087 --> 13:57.166
And the balcony windows are open
a little bit,

13:57.167 --> 13:59.806
and I can hear church bells.

13:59.807 --> 14:01.927
So, you haven't really thought
about it, then?

14:04.167 --> 14:05.686
What about you, Rae?

14:05.687 --> 14:09.286
Hmm. I want Finn naked,

14:09.287 --> 14:10.886
covered in Dairylea.

14:10.887 --> 14:12.886
Rae...

14:12.887 --> 14:16.646
The Dairylea is optional.

14:16.647 --> 14:18.246
I dunno.

14:18.247 --> 14:22.247
The other night,
we were getting really close,

14:22.407 --> 14:25.526
but then he just rushed off.

14:25.527 --> 14:28.166
Well, do you think he's nervous
about moving too fast

14:28.167 --> 14:30.686
cos you were ill? What d'you mean?

14:30.687 --> 14:33.086
Because Finn's nice, isn't he?
Yeah.

14:33.087 --> 14:36.086
You know, maybe he's worried it'll
be too much, or whatever.

14:36.087 --> 14:37.886
Maybe you need to be more forward,

14:37.887 --> 14:40.126
you know, let him know
that you're ready.

14:40.127 --> 14:43.486
Anyway, I suggest you girls get it
in the bag as soon as possible. Why?

14:43.487 --> 14:45.086
Well, college starts very soon.

14:45.087 --> 14:47.446
Do you really want to be
the only girls to turn up

14:47.447 --> 14:48.806
with your V plates intact?

14:48.807 --> 14:51.246
She's talking about us
being virgins still.

14:51.247 --> 14:54.206
Yeah. I got it.

14:54.207 --> 14:58.207
You girls need to get it in the bag,
and quick.

15:08.207 --> 15:12.207
This is both disgusting and
depressing. What a treat.

15:12.687 --> 15:16.687
Maybe we should kiss?

15:18.047 --> 15:21.606
Right. Me and Izzy have decided...

15:21.607 --> 15:23.926
we're going camping.

15:23.927 --> 15:26.366
What? I hate camping.
Why do we have to go

15:26.367 --> 15:29.006
sleep in a field when we've got
perfectly good beds? Ow!

15:29.007 --> 15:31.326
Did you just kick me?

15:31.327 --> 15:33.766
We don't need a reason to have fun,
Archie.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.366
Don't be so boring.

15:35.367 --> 15:39.006
We just thought that it would be
something nice to do

15:39.007 --> 15:40.646
before college starts.

15:40.647 --> 15:43.526
You know,
celebrate the end of summer.

15:43.527 --> 15:47.527
When were you thinking of going?
Next Saturday. What?

15:47.967 --> 15:50.526
What? What are you doing?

15:50.527 --> 15:53.766
I thought we wanted to go camping
before college starts.

15:53.767 --> 15:55.206
Yeah.

15:55.207 --> 15:56.766
College starts next Monday.

15:56.767 --> 16:00.206
No. College starts this Monday.

16:00.207 --> 16:04.207
In five days.

16:04.927 --> 16:08.806
Guys, when does college start?

16:08.807 --> 16:11.646
College starts this Monday.
They sent out, like,

16:11.647 --> 16:15.647
4 million reminder letters
over the holidays.

16:19.807 --> 16:22.686
I'm not even going
and I knew that.

16:22.687 --> 16:24.006
Rae...

16:24.007 --> 16:26.046
Rae... You all right, Raemundo?

16:26.047 --> 16:27.566
Good, yeah.

16:27.567 --> 16:29.966
So, when's camping? Saturday?

16:29.967 --> 16:31.606
Yeah.

16:31.607 --> 16:33.206
Jesus. Has anyone even got a tent?

16:33.207 --> 16:34.326
No. No.

16:34.327 --> 16:38.327
Good. This should be great!

16:41.207 --> 16:43.566
Where's my mail?

16:43.567 --> 16:46.446
Um, I don't know.
Why don't you look in the place?

16:46.447 --> 16:47.686
What place?

16:47.687 --> 16:51.687
Behind the pig on the radiator.

16:53.687 --> 16:57.687
What the fuck...

17:00.047 --> 17:01.606
Jesus Christ!

17:01.607 --> 17:04.965
How long have you been putting
my mail behind that pig?

17:04.967 --> 17:08.846
College starts on Monday.
I've got to get an outfit,

17:08.847 --> 17:12.847
I've got to get
my timetable sorted...

17:14.247 --> 17:16.925
Are...

17:16.926 --> 17:18.806
Are you wearing my top?

17:18.807 --> 17:21.366
You don't mind, do you?
I thought it looked quite funky.

17:21.367 --> 17:25.006
"Funky"? Yeah, that's what
you guys say now, isn't it?

17:25.007 --> 17:26.446
Which guys?

17:28.166 --> 17:31.206
I like it when we have a laugh
like this, Rae.

17:31.207 --> 17:33.446
We're like sisters sometimes,
really, aren't we?

17:33.447 --> 17:35.646
No.

17:35.647 --> 17:38.846
Are you on drugs?

17:38.847 --> 17:40.566
Just trying to look younger.

17:40.567 --> 17:42.166
Why?

17:42.167 --> 17:44.006
Look, I'm going through the change.

17:44.007 --> 17:47.366
Karim is already 12 years
younger than me.

17:47.367 --> 17:51.367
How is he going to feel
being married to an old woman...

17:53.087 --> 17:54.606
that is drying up?

17:54.607 --> 17:57.086
Weird things are happening to me.

17:57.087 --> 18:01.087
I cried at Wheel Of Fortune today.

18:07.487 --> 18:11.487
'Five days till college, Tixy. '

18:16.767 --> 18:20.767
'It's not that I'm worried about it,
Tix. I'm not even bothered.

18:22.287 --> 18:24.206
'I've got 107 hours, 16 minutes

18:24.207 --> 18:26.487
'and 28 seconds
until college starts... '

18:28.327 --> 18:30.966
'.. to get ready, to prepare myself.

18:30.967 --> 18:34.086
'And, oh, yeah, to pop my cherry. '

18:34.087 --> 18:37.886
Right, so, what do people wear
to college?

18:37.887 --> 18:40.566
Just anything?
Or are there any don'ts?

18:40.567 --> 18:42.566
Rae, we're not here to shop for
college.

18:42.567 --> 18:45.566
You and Izzy are here to shop for
camping. Oh, we're getting tents?

18:45.567 --> 18:48.166
No, Rae.

18:48.167 --> 18:50.846
Come on.

18:50.847 --> 18:54.847
'Oh, tits. '

18:59.567 --> 19:02.486
You can't have a full cup, Rae.
It's all about the half cup.

19:02.487 --> 19:04.246
Well, what about support?

19:04.247 --> 19:08.247
Bollocks to support.
It's all about looking amazing.

19:08.447 --> 19:12.447
Right, what do you reckon?
That'd look so amazing on you, Chlo.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.526
What have we here, then?

19:16.527 --> 19:18.406
30B?

19:18.407 --> 19:22.407
These breasts are good, but small.
They need lifting.

19:23.167 --> 19:24.726
38F?

19:24.727 --> 19:28.246
These breasts are good, but big.
They need shaping.

19:28.247 --> 19:31.606
'I felt like I was
in Goldilocks And The Three Bears.

19:31.607 --> 19:35.607
'Of course, guess whose tits were
just like the baby bear's porridge...

19:36.007 --> 19:37.406
'just right. '

19:37.407 --> 19:39.686
These breasts are very good.

19:39.687 --> 19:42.326
I don't like them,
cos I like a challenge

19:42.327 --> 19:45.526
and these breasts
don't bloody challenge me.

19:45.527 --> 19:47.526
That's a compliment, love. 32C.

19:47.527 --> 19:51.527
So, matching tops and bottoms?

19:51.847 --> 19:53.646
Yeah. We all want proper lingerie.

19:53.647 --> 19:57.647
'The worst thing though, Tix, was
that a lot of the stuff was so nice.

19:58.807 --> 20:01.446
'It was so pretty and delicate.

20:01.447 --> 20:04.326
'It just wasn't made for someone
whose body wasn't pretty,

20:04.327 --> 20:07.566
'wasn't delicate. '

20:07.567 --> 20:09.006
Love?

20:09.007 --> 20:11.446
Come on.

20:11.447 --> 20:15.447
Don't be scared of your own tits.

20:22.967 --> 20:26.967
'The funny thing was, Tix,
is that all I wanted to do was go

20:27.087 --> 20:29.806
'and show Finn what I'd bought,
get him excited for camping.

20:29.807 --> 20:33.006
'Bollocks to mine
and Izzy's shagus pactus.

20:33.007 --> 20:35.446
'The clock was ticking.
Maybe he'd ask me to try it on

20:35.447 --> 20:38.406
'and he wouldn't be able to resist. '

20:38.407 --> 20:41.006
Rae. You're just in time!

20:41.007 --> 20:44.686
I was just about to stick on me
limited edition Brothers In Arms vinyl.

20:44.687 --> 20:48.687
I can't promise I won't break into some serious
air guitaring during Money For Nothing!

20:49.287 --> 20:50.486
Um...

20:50.487 --> 20:52.566
We can rain check.

20:52.567 --> 20:56.406
Yeah, um, let's rain check.
Is Finn in?

20:56.407 --> 21:00.407
Yeah, he's upstairs. Come in.

21:26.927 --> 21:30.188
Holy fuck.

21:54.045 --> 21:56.326
It's not what most people would
do with a bottle of whisky

21:56.345 --> 21:59.105
at the weekend but this is the ninth
annual...

21:59.139 --> 22:02.339
.. phenomenon that's baffled
the... Over 2,000...

22:02.428 --> 22:06.428
.. and needs to be seen to be
believed. When there's no more...

22:07.588 --> 22:11.588
.. balls. A few new tricks from
fellow perf...

22:21.160 --> 22:25.160
'Tixy, I feel like my mind
has been poisoned by beauty.

22:25.826 --> 22:29.826
'I was so annoyed at myself.
I had the perfect chance

22:29.901 --> 22:33.901
'to throw a pint of sex in his face,
and I blew it. '

22:42.061 --> 22:46.061
All right, fatty?

22:53.901 --> 22:55.500
Er, where have you two been?

22:55.501 --> 22:59.100
We've just been out having fun,
like young couples do, you know.

22:59.101 --> 23:01.380
No, I don't.

23:01.381 --> 23:02.521
What's that?

23:02.522 --> 23:04.202
Special TV.

23:04.239 --> 23:08.239
Just a new TV. But check this out.
It's got a VCR built in.

23:09.065 --> 23:11.264
What, built in? Yeah.

23:11.265 --> 23:13.305
Built in to the TV? Yeah.

23:13.529 --> 23:17.829
Yeah, good, because the remote
control for that piece of junk there

23:17.867 --> 23:19.466
has stopped working.

23:19.467 --> 23:22.306
Oh, well, it's not for down here.
It's for mine and Karim's room.

23:22.307 --> 23:26.306
What? Why are you putting
a video player in your room?

23:26.307 --> 23:30.307
Don't argue, Rae. If you want one
for yourself, get a job and save up.

23:30.707 --> 23:34.707
But you don't even own any videos.

23:39.387 --> 23:42.586
'Tix, my mum is still hugely
selfish.

23:42.587 --> 23:46.587
'She doesn't even own any videos,
for fuck's sake. '

23:52.987 --> 23:56.987
She doesn't even own any video...

24:14.747 --> 24:18.747
Missionary: Impossible.

24:23.547 --> 24:26.706
That's impossible!

24:26.707 --> 24:30.106
'These people can't be real, Tix.

24:30.107 --> 24:34.107
'They were probably made in a sex
factory somewhere near Munich. '

24:35.787 --> 24:39.787
'Hang on a minute.
Something's missing. '

24:52.707 --> 24:56.066
OK, Rachel. What style
did you decide on in the end?

24:56.067 --> 25:00.067
Oh, just the standard.
I just want my bikini line doing.

25:00.467 --> 25:02.906
OK.

25:02.907 --> 25:06.907
How much is it?
It's Â£7.50 for a standard.

25:07.987 --> 25:09.306
Let's call it a tenner.

25:09.307 --> 25:12.906
'Now, just think about something
nice and lovely.

25:12.907 --> 25:16.627
'Lovely clouds. Kittens. Flowers.
Puppies. '

25:17.907 --> 25:21.907
'Fluffy bastard cloud kittens!'

25:25.107 --> 25:26.786
How was it?

25:26.787 --> 25:30.546
Well, my lady clam no longer
looks like a barber's bin,

25:30.547 --> 25:33.586
if that's what you mean.

25:33.587 --> 25:37.586
Are you nervous about camping
tomorrow? A little bit.

25:37.587 --> 25:40.866
I'm excited but... you know
the other day at the bra shop?

25:40.867 --> 25:41.906
Yeah.

25:41.907 --> 25:44.546
Chloe looked so good in her
underwear.

25:44.547 --> 25:46.986
She looked perfect.

25:46.987 --> 25:50.987
I just was worried that
I don't look like that.

25:51.507 --> 25:53.826
I don't think many people
look perfect.

25:53.827 --> 25:57.827
Isabelle?

26:01.067 --> 26:02.546
'Thank God for Izzy.

26:02.547 --> 26:05.666
'Thank God that someone else
felt the way I did.

26:05.667 --> 26:07.306
'That someone else wasn't... '

26:07.307 --> 26:11.307
Perfect.

26:19.827 --> 26:23.746
So what d'you think has changed? Why
d'you think you're happy?

26:23.747 --> 26:26.386
You told me to start liking myself.

26:26.387 --> 26:29.386
And do you?

26:29.387 --> 26:31.146
I've got a boyfriend.

26:31.147 --> 26:32.986
Right.

26:32.987 --> 26:36.466
He's delicious. Too delicious.

26:36.467 --> 26:38.666
What d'you mean, too delicious?

26:38.667 --> 26:41.906
Nothing.

26:41.907 --> 26:43.586
It was a joke.

26:43.587 --> 26:45.546
I dunno.

26:45.547 --> 26:49.547
It's easier to like yourself
when someone likes you, isn't it?

26:49.707 --> 26:52.066
You should like yourself
because you're a good person,

26:52.067 --> 26:54.626
not because someone else likes you.
I didn't say that.

26:54.627 --> 26:58.627
What did you say?

27:00.907 --> 27:03.026
At our last session we ran out of
time.

27:03.027 --> 27:05.986
We didn't get to finish what we were
talking about. Oh, yeah?

27:05.987 --> 27:07.826
Oh, yeah.

27:07.827 --> 27:11.226
I've been waiting for you
to bring it up in your own time,

27:11.227 --> 27:15.227
but now I'm beginning to worry that
we're... just avoiding the subject.

27:17.227 --> 27:21.227
Why can't you just be like
a proper therapist?

27:22.067 --> 27:25.746
Punch pillows
and play word association?

27:25.747 --> 27:27.186
I'm afraid we don't do any of that.

27:27.187 --> 27:30.986
I'd like it more if we did.

27:30.987 --> 27:33.426
Right.

27:33.427 --> 27:34.506
Word association.

27:34.507 --> 27:38.266
I say a word, you say the first
thing that comes into your head.

27:38.267 --> 27:40.066
Home. Bedroom.

27:40.067 --> 27:41.186
Tree. Bark.

27:41.187 --> 27:43.426
Dog. Bark.

27:43.427 --> 27:44.506
Mum. Dad.

27:44.507 --> 27:46.346
Dad. Man.

27:46.347 --> 27:49.386
Kester. Divorce.

27:49.387 --> 27:51.226
Rae. Davies.

27:51.227 --> 27:52.706
Rae. Me.

27:52.707 --> 27:54.186
Boys. Gents.

27:54.187 --> 27:55.626
Food. Eat.

27:55.627 --> 27:56.906
Tix. Friend.

27:56.907 --> 27:58.106
Skin. Itchy.

27:58.107 --> 27:59.146
Dog. Bite.

27:59.147 --> 28:00.946
Boys. Fat. Food. Fat.

28:00.947 --> 28:04.947
Rae. Fat.

28:07.547 --> 28:11.547
I do like myself.

28:15.547 --> 28:18.706
'Check. '

28:18.707 --> 28:22.707
'Check. '

28:23.107 --> 28:27.107
'It's here, Tix. The day of
Operation Bang Out has arrived.

28:29.307 --> 28:30.626
'I needed to take it up a notch.

28:30.627 --> 28:34.627
'I had to do something
I'd never attempted before.

28:34.907 --> 28:37.227
'Flirt. '

28:41.547 --> 28:45.547
Finn, what are you...

28:47.747 --> 28:51.747
Get in the back seat. Now!

28:52.587 --> 28:56.506
D'you want water? Here.

28:56.507 --> 29:00.507
'Say something. Anything. '

29:00.987 --> 29:03.226
I was just thinking about
how sexy you were.

29:03.227 --> 29:07.227
Oi! You'll make me crash.

29:07.547 --> 29:10.666
I was thinking about tonight,
too.

29:10.667 --> 29:14.667
What's... What's happening
tonight?

29:15.627 --> 29:19.627
Doesn't matter.

29:23.347 --> 29:25.226
Who's in with me?

29:25.227 --> 29:29.227
I'll get in with Archie.

29:31.867 --> 29:35.106
So we ended up having to ring
Dan Rigby, but I got two tents.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.906
Two?!

29:36.907 --> 29:40.266
Yeah. Two free manors. So me and
Izzy can sleep in with Archie

29:40.267 --> 29:42.786
and you two can sleep in with
Chlo.

29:42.787 --> 29:45.786
We said, "Get three tents. "

29:45.787 --> 29:48.426
What am I, Captain Fucking Tent
Shop?

29:48.427 --> 29:50.807
Why am I the one always
sorting stuff?

29:50.900 --> 29:54.900
I'm not Del Boy.
I get zero appreciation for it.

29:57.958 --> 30:01.958
That's bloody marvellous.

30:04.798 --> 30:07.597
I got you a copy of the photos from
the beer garden the other day.

30:07.598 --> 30:10.957
Thanks.

30:10.958 --> 30:14.877
It's inevitable, Izzy.

30:14.878 --> 30:16.317
Thanks to this tent situation,

30:16.318 --> 30:19.997
we are pretty much turning up
to college virgins.

30:19.998 --> 30:23.998
Actually, er... I need to tell you
something.

30:25.518 --> 30:27.477
Me and Chop had sex last night.

30:27.478 --> 30:29.277
What?!

30:29.278 --> 30:31.557
How could you let that happen?

30:31.558 --> 30:34.957
We had a pact.
Yeah, well, it wasn't like that.

30:34.958 --> 30:37.397
I went over to Chop's to show him the
new underwear I bought

30:37.398 --> 30:40.637
to get him excited for camping
and stuff, and then...

30:40.638 --> 30:43.757
well... we did it.

30:43.758 --> 30:45.517
It wasn't like I imagined it.

30:45.518 --> 30:47.357
It was on the couch in his
lounge.

30:47.358 --> 30:49.277
Crimewatch was on in the
background,

30:49.278 --> 30:51.277
and Crimewatch
scares me a little bit,

30:51.278 --> 30:54.117
so I was a bit distracted, but...

30:54.118 --> 30:58.118
...I enjoyed it, though. The sex,
I mean.

31:01.078 --> 31:02.557
Congratulations.

31:02.558 --> 31:06.558
Thanks.

31:09.638 --> 31:13.638
'So there I was, Tix,
the last virgin standing.

31:13.718 --> 31:17.718
'Two days to college, two shared
tents and zero chance of a shag. '

31:25.158 --> 31:28.157
What's up?

31:28.158 --> 31:31.997
It's Chloe. She keeps touching
me.

31:31.998 --> 31:34.477
Touching you how?

31:34.478 --> 31:37.997
You know, touching touching.
She's pretty tactile.

31:37.998 --> 31:40.797
Maybe she's just touching you
the same amount as always.

31:40.798 --> 31:43.117
Yeah, maybe.

31:43.118 --> 31:45.437
At least you're getting touched
anyway.

31:45.438 --> 31:47.237
What's up?

31:47.238 --> 31:51.157
I'll tell you what's up, Archie.
I'm wearing ridiculous underwear

31:51.158 --> 31:53.517
that is offering no support
whatsoever

31:53.518 --> 31:57.518
to my boobs.

31:58.358 --> 32:02.358
Here.

32:05.318 --> 32:09.318
Oh, God, that feels good.

32:09.918 --> 32:12.597
I fucking hate camping.

32:12.598 --> 32:16.598
Me, too.

32:37.998 --> 32:41.797
You all right, Raemundo?
Yeah.

32:41.798 --> 32:45.798
But what about in yourself,
like? I'm fine.

32:51.078 --> 32:55.078
Wanna go for a walk, girl?

32:57.398 --> 33:01.398
Cute, aren't they?
Yeah.

33:05.478 --> 33:09.478
You know you don't have
to give me space, don't you?

33:09.798 --> 33:12.597
What d'you mean?

33:12.598 --> 33:16.598
I mean that I know I've been ill
but...

33:17.678 --> 33:21.678
...you're the only one who doesn't
ask if I'm all right all the time.

33:22.598 --> 33:24.717
I like that.

33:24.718 --> 33:28.718
That you just treat me normal.

33:29.878 --> 33:33.878
I like you.
I'm glad you like me.

33:34.158 --> 33:38.158
Because I've got a surprise
for you.

33:40.318 --> 33:41.597
Oh...

33:41.598 --> 33:43.797
What's this?

33:43.798 --> 33:47.798
When I say, "To be continued,"

33:47.918 --> 33:51.918
I mean, to be continued.

33:54.198 --> 33:55.997
'Jesus.

33:55.998 --> 33:59.998
'I was so turned on, we were gonna
need a canoe and life jackets. '

34:02.998 --> 34:06.677
'Maybe sometimes it does
happen how you imagine it

34:06.678 --> 34:09.357
'cos I felt like I was in a movie.

34:09.358 --> 34:11.036
'Not a crap one.

34:11.038 --> 34:13.757
'An amazing, brilliant,
unbelievable,

34:13.757 --> 34:17.757
'mega, fucking awesome
one. '

34:28.358 --> 34:32.358
You OK?

34:32.958 --> 34:36.958
I just need to freshen up.

34:44.958 --> 34:48.958
What the fuck are you doing?

35:07.238 --> 35:11.238
'It was the first time
I'd seen us together. '

35:16.638 --> 35:20.638
'I knew he was out of my league, but
I didn't know just how much. '

35:24.918 --> 35:28.397
'No-one could understand why we were
together, and all of a sudden...

35:28.398 --> 35:32.398
'neither could I.'

35:41.478 --> 35:43.997
Is everything OK?

35:43.998 --> 35:47.998
Yeah... Um... I've just got a
massive headache.

35:50.598 --> 35:52.397
Why didn't you say, you numpty?

35:52.398 --> 35:56.398
You know what's good for headaches,
don't you?

35:57.598 --> 36:00.077
Vodka!

36:00.078 --> 36:02.077
D'you want one?

36:02.078 --> 36:03.666
I'll get two glasses.

36:09.596 --> 36:13.556
'Tixy, I have totally, utterly
and unquestionably

36:13.592 --> 36:15.792
'failed to lose my virginity.

36:15.986 --> 36:19.985
'I may as well go to college
with it written on my face. '

36:19.986 --> 36:23.986
Oh!

36:24.186 --> 36:27.345
Oh, my God, Rae, you need to help me.

36:27.346 --> 36:29.905
What? Chloe!

36:29.906 --> 36:33.086
Because you and Finn went off
last night,

36:33.162 --> 36:35.761
we ended up sharing a tent
on our own!

36:35.762 --> 36:38.321
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!

36:38.322 --> 36:41.841
I turn around to get in
my sleeping bag

36:41.842 --> 36:45.842
and when I turn back, she's laying
there in some sexy lingerie number.

36:49.962 --> 36:51.761
Oh, my God!

36:51.762 --> 36:53.361
What did you do?

36:53.362 --> 36:56.361
I let her kiss me for a minute,
and then...

36:56.362 --> 36:58.162
What?

36:59.802 --> 37:03.802
I pretended I was asleep.

37:05.202 --> 37:06.482
I feel terrible.

37:08.122 --> 37:11.721
Oh, my God!

37:11.722 --> 37:15.722
Can we go back to civilisation now,
please?!

37:16.122 --> 37:17.881
You all right?

37:17.882 --> 37:21.882
Yeah.

37:29.362 --> 37:31.761
'Summer's over, Tixy.

37:31.762 --> 37:35.762
'The bubble's burst. '

37:36.922 --> 37:40.161
Rae... I wanted to ask you something.

37:40.162 --> 37:42.681
What?

37:42.682 --> 37:46.682
Have you been in mine and Karim's
room recently? No.

37:48.522 --> 37:50.481
Why? No reason.

37:50.482 --> 37:54.482
How's that TV/VCR working out?

37:57.802 --> 37:59.681
It's all right, yeah.

37:59.682 --> 38:02.721
Like you said, I don't own any
videos, so...

38:02.722 --> 38:06.722
Well, maybe you should bring it
downstairs, then?

38:07.162 --> 38:11.162
Unless you're planning on
watching videos on it...

38:12.002 --> 38:14.761
when you're in bed.

38:14.762 --> 38:18.361
No, I wasn't planning on doing that.

38:18.362 --> 38:22.362
So... Yes, good idea.

38:23.362 --> 38:25.321
Cool.

38:25.322 --> 38:29.322
Anyway, you better get some sleep.
College tomorrow.

38:30.122 --> 38:34.122
'I still had time, Tix. Ten hours,
eight minutes and 14 seconds...

38:36.082 --> 38:40.082
'to sleep, to get ready,
to prepare myself. '

38:45.682 --> 38:48.682
Come on, get up! You're late!

38:56.882 --> 39:00.882
Look at you!
New beginnings and all that.

39:01.882 --> 39:03.961
How are you feeling, anyway?

39:03.962 --> 39:06.161
I wish people would stop asking me
that.

39:06.162 --> 39:08.761
People only ask because
they care about you, love.

39:08.762 --> 39:11.201
I know you must be nervous
about today,

39:11.202 --> 39:14.441
what with everything that happened,
you know, at your old school.

39:14.442 --> 39:17.041
But I'm really proud of you, Rae,

39:17.042 --> 39:20.201
how you're coping.

39:20.202 --> 39:22.921
Four months ago, I would never have
said you were well enough

39:22.922 --> 39:26.922
to go to college. Yeah.

39:38.802 --> 39:42.761
'Mum was right, Tix.
I had the gang now.

39:42.762 --> 39:46.762
'It wasn't going to be like
last time. '

39:52.682 --> 39:56.241
Good morning! How are you?!

39:56.242 --> 39:58.881
I got you a brew.

39:58.882 --> 40:02.882
How's your migraine?
All right.

40:05.042 --> 40:09.042
'I've got Finn now, Tixy. '

40:11.562 --> 40:14.641
'It wasn't going to be like
last time. '

40:14.642 --> 40:17.041
Do I look all right?
Cos I want to make a good impression.

40:17.042 --> 40:18.601
For who?! It's only college!

40:18.602 --> 40:21.841
It's all right for you, Finn. You're
a boy and you're in second year.

40:21.842 --> 40:23.241
Everyone'll be staring at us.

40:23.242 --> 40:25.361
They're not going to be staring.

40:25.362 --> 40:27.961
They so are. We're fresh meat, babe.

40:27.962 --> 40:31.321
It's like they're all sitting at our
restaurant waiting for the delivery

40:31.322 --> 40:35.322
and we're the food. Oi! You two are
taken. Remember that.

40:39.722 --> 40:43.722
'I had the gang now, Tixy.

40:45.162 --> 40:47.921
'It wasn't going to be like
last time. '

40:47.922 --> 40:49.601
Tonight, babe. Yeah.

40:49.602 --> 40:53.602
Bye. See you later.

41:00.002 --> 41:01.481
'I've got Finn now.

41:01.482 --> 41:05.482
'It wasn't going to be like
last time. '

41:45.242 --> 41:47.401
Boys. Fat.

41:47.402 --> 41:50.281
Food. Fat.

41:50.282 --> 41:52.801
Rae. Fat.

41:52.802 --> 41:54.281
Boys. Fat.

41:54.282 --> 41:55.601
Rae. Fat.

41:55.602 --> 41:56.681
Food. Fat.

41:56.682 --> 42:01.842
Rae. Fat.

42:04.802 --> 42:06.481
D'you know where the toilets are?

42:06.482 --> 42:08.521
Round there. Why, what's wrong?

42:08.522 --> 42:12.522
Nothing. I'll see you in a bit,
yeah?

42:12.682 --> 42:16.682
Give us a shout if you need
anything, though. Rae?

42:17.002 --> 42:21.002
See you later, then.

42:58.002 --> 43:02.002
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck indeed.

43:14.682 --> 43:17.961
If I find out which one of you
jokers set off the fire alarm,

43:17.962 --> 43:20.322
that's it, you're done for the year.

43:27.442 --> 43:29.641
'I've been living in denial, Tix.

43:29.642 --> 43:33.642
'About being better,
about me and Finn.

43:34.242 --> 43:38.242
'About everything. '

43:40.282 --> 43:44.282
Rae?

43:52.002 --> 43:56.002
I'm a mess.

43:59.842 --> 44:03.842
I miss her.

44:04.242 --> 44:05.601
Yeah. Me, too.

44:05.602 --> 44:09.602
Then why aren't you more upset?
You don't even seem upset.

44:16.362 --> 44:20.362
I'm devastated, Rae.

44:23.682 --> 44:27.441
I'm sorry I didn't go to the
funeral.

44:27.442 --> 44:29.041
I just...

44:29.042 --> 44:31.601
I couldn't.

44:31.602 --> 44:34.081
It's only a funeral.

44:34.082 --> 44:38.082
You know she wouldn't have cared.

44:38.202 --> 44:42.202
But funerals do have their purpose.

44:43.842 --> 44:47.842
They're places where we get
to say goodbye.

45:07.922 --> 45:09.362
Bye, Tix.

45:23.562 --> 45:27.562
'Dear Diary, there are two things
you should know about me.

45:30.082 --> 45:34.082
'I'm still fat.

45:35.402 --> 45:38.841
'And I'm still mad. '

45:38.842 --> 45:41.361
Rae!

45:41.362 --> 45:43.041
I've missed you.

45:43.042 --> 45:46.441
Oh, Danny, I've missed you, too.

45:46.442 --> 45:48.961
How are you doing?

45:48.962 --> 45:52.161
Not the best, to be honest.

45:52.162 --> 45:55.481
Where's your hats? What hats?

45:55.482 --> 45:57.921
All right, everybody.

45:57.922 --> 46:01.922
Welcome to group.

46:03.322 --> 46:07.322
Let's just jump right in, will we?

46:08.482 --> 46:12.482
So, has anybody got anything
they want to share this week?

46:17.042 --> 46:20.561
Liam, what about you?

46:20.562 --> 46:24.562
Different week.

46:25.922 --> 46:27.820
Same old bullshit.
