WEBVTT

00:10.510 --> 00:11.970
Night has fallen, Firewood,

00:12.053 --> 00:14.472
and the time has come
for the last night of camp dance!

00:14.556 --> 00:17.142
Oh, and don't forget,
our visiting group of alumni,

00:17.225 --> 00:21.771
the JCs of '81, are gonna be kickin' it
alongside us all night.

00:21.855 --> 00:25.024
So slap on that cologne
and take a hit of that breath spray,

00:25.108 --> 00:28.361
â€˜cause it's time to do some night howling.

00:28.445 --> 00:32.156
♪ Everybody was night howling ♪

00:34.200 --> 00:36.953
Launch to commence in 40 minutes.

00:37.037 --> 00:40.415
Look at these fools. If only they knew.

00:41.833 --> 00:43.710
I'd like to make a toast.

00:44.753 --> 00:48.757
To the successful nuking
of a children's sleepaway camp.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.300
Cheers!

00:51.050 --> 00:53.219
Now, let's go topside.

00:53.303 --> 00:56.306
I wanna see the full destruction in 3-D.

00:56.389 --> 01:00.643
Georgie, grab my camera, would you?
I'd like to document this.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.604
One step ahead of you, sir.

01:02.687 --> 01:04.938
Don't brag, George.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.614
Modesty is a virtue.

01:20.663 --> 01:23.917
Better get ready for the dance, Coop.
You know Beth wants us all there.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.627
-Whatever.
-Whoa.

01:25.710 --> 01:26.878
Who pooped in your tuba?

01:26.961 --> 01:30.131
Ginny dumped me.
Thanks for asking.

01:30.882 --> 01:32.675
Hey, what happened to you, man?

01:32.759 --> 01:34.427
What does it look like, Gary? You blind?

01:41.684 --> 01:42.685
Don't ask.

01:44.187 --> 01:47.982
Some of these 16-year-old JCs
look like they're 21,

01:48.066 --> 01:50.777
and I'm 22,
so that is a one-year difference.

01:50.860 --> 01:53.279
-But they're not 21. They're 16.
-Yeah, exactly!

01:53.363 --> 01:55.865
Um, has anyone seen Coop or Ginny?

01:55.949 --> 01:57.659
"Um, has anyone seen
Coop or Ginny?"

01:57.742 --> 01:59.160
God, you're such a blowhard!

01:59.244 --> 02:01.955
Wow. Who died and made you
mayor of King Shit Mountain?

02:02.038 --> 02:03.248
-You did!
-I did not.

02:03.331 --> 02:05.792
I don't have the jurisdiction for that.
It's an elected position.

02:05.875 --> 02:07.752
- Has anybody seen Andy?
- I'm right here.

02:07.836 --> 02:10.713
Have you been sitting there the whole time
since you lost King of Camp?

02:10.797 --> 02:14.801
I didn't lose King of Camp!
The whole competition is bogus!

02:14.884 --> 02:16.219
Besides, I can't find one person

02:16.302 --> 02:18.680
that saw Deegs on
the backwards steeplechase course,

02:18.763 --> 02:21.432
which means that he ran through the woods
to get ahead of me.

02:21.516 --> 02:23.977
And he was wearing gloves
during the greased watermelon toss,

02:24.060 --> 02:25.562
which is total violation of the whole--

02:25.645 --> 02:27.230
Whoo!

02:27.313 --> 02:29.232
Who wants to get down?

02:29.816 --> 02:32.026
Finally, somebody's having a good time.

02:32.110 --> 02:35.071
Victor got laid!

02:35.155 --> 02:39.117
Ladies and germs,
I am an ice-cold Maytag re-fuck-erator.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.452
We all know you're a virgin, Vic.

02:41.536 --> 02:46.291
Correction. I was a virgin.
Not no more.

02:46.374 --> 02:49.460
I didded the deed,
and then I spreaded my seed.

02:49.544 --> 02:51.963
Hey, have you guys ever tried
the thing at the end--

02:52.046 --> 02:52.964
Enough, Victor!

02:53.047 --> 02:54.591
It's like your weenie's a volcano,

02:54.674 --> 02:56.634
but it's not hot lava,
it's like hair conditioner?

02:56.718 --> 02:59.053
-Vic!
-No, no, but it's like stuff comes out.

02:59.137 --> 03:00.179
Stop!

03:01.806 --> 03:04.142
This whole act is getting
a little pathetic, dude.

03:04.976 --> 03:06.853
I'm not lying, man.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.230
I'm like you guys now.

03:10.565 --> 03:13.651
Hey, yeah, sure, man.
You'll do it one day.

03:13.735 --> 03:14.819
I did do it!

03:18.823 --> 03:20.950
Why isn't anybody happy for me?

03:22.619 --> 03:24.495
I'm happy for you, kid.

03:26.080 --> 03:29.876
Dave, bump the lead at 10:00.
I have got the top story.

03:29.959 --> 03:31.628
Whoa. Where's the fire, girl?

03:31.711 --> 03:33.129
You have a top story, Lindsay?

03:33.212 --> 03:35.506
What is it?
"Which Shampoo Helps Split Ends"?

03:35.590 --> 03:39.469
Yeah! Or is it
"Fun Summer Salads on a Budget"?

03:39.552 --> 03:42.430
Guys, I have a lead on something huge.

03:42.513 --> 03:45.683
It involves a summer camp
and a former president.

03:47.810 --> 03:49.354
Wow, that's great, Linds.

03:49.437 --> 03:53.024
You know, maybe we can take a look
and see exactly what you got.

03:53.107 --> 03:56.236
You haven't talked to anyone else yet,
right, Linds?

03:56.319 --> 03:57.320
We have a code six.

03:57.946 --> 04:00.365
Uh... No, why?

04:00.448 --> 04:02.992
No reason. We just wanna keep
the exclusive on this thing.

04:04.452 --> 04:05.578
Uh-huh.

04:08.539 --> 04:09.499
Stop her!

04:11.000 --> 04:17.074

04:20.218 --> 04:21.052
Damn it!

04:21.135 --> 04:23.054
-Where'd she go?
-That way.

04:23.137 --> 04:24.138
Okay.

04:25.181 --> 04:26.599
Out of my way!

04:30.937 --> 04:33.481
Help! Is someone out there?

04:33.564 --> 04:35.775
If only there was another way out.

04:35.858 --> 04:38.319
Being stuck in here is so grating!

04:40.196 --> 04:41.698
Grating.

04:41.781 --> 04:44.033
That's it. A grate.

04:46.035 --> 04:48.496
Great! A grate!

05:03.303 --> 05:05.305
-We're here.
-Let's go.

05:27.744 --> 05:29.912
This just might work.

05:43.926 --> 05:46.429
And now it's time
for the popular girls to perform

05:46.512 --> 05:49.057
their annual end of summer dance.

05:51.434 --> 05:53.436
♪ I got trouble on my mind ♪

05:54.270 --> 05:56.189

Man, was it always this lame?

06:10.912 --> 06:12.955
-This party's a dud.
-Is there any booze here?

06:13.039 --> 06:15.583
Um, no, because it's a party
for a bunch of kids.

06:15.666 --> 06:16.918
Whatever.

06:18.586 --> 06:19.796
Let's get this over with.

06:27.678 --> 06:30.890
All right, gentlemen.
Let's get this plan in action.

06:33.559 --> 06:34.811
Did you hear something?

06:37.605 --> 06:38.940
-No.
-No, I didn't hear anything.

06:39.023 --> 06:40.024
Hear what?

06:40.108 --> 06:42.151
The sound. I heard a sound.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.611
There's something up there.

06:44.654 --> 06:46.197
-I heard you.
-I heard you.

06:55.915 --> 06:58.042
- It's nothing. Let's go.
- Let's go!

07:01.003 --> 07:02.380
All right,
there's a secret passageway

07:02.463 --> 07:04.382
to the underground bunker in the pantry.

07:04.465 --> 07:07.135
Whatever Reagan's up to,
that's where we'll find it.

07:07.218 --> 07:08.052
Follow me.

07:08.136 --> 07:12.557
The theme tonight is Shakespeare, folks,
so it's time for a traditional waltz!

07:12.640 --> 07:14.642
Oh, good. I love waltzing.

07:23.901 --> 07:24.777
Is Ashley okay?

07:25.361 --> 07:29.240
Yeah, I paid a camper $100
to stand over her crib while she slept.

07:29.323 --> 07:30.658
She's safe.

07:30.741 --> 07:33.536
I'm just saying,
I haven't done King of Camp in ten years,

07:33.619 --> 07:36.581
and this Deegs kid was probably
training all summer for today.

07:36.664 --> 07:39.292
Andy! Nobody cares. Nobody!

07:39.375 --> 07:43.171
It's just a dumb series of goofy contests.
It means nothing!

07:43.254 --> 07:47.842
You are obsessed with losing something
that nobody but you cares about.

07:47.925 --> 07:49.302
When are you gonna grow up?

07:49.385 --> 07:50.553
Hey, man, ease up.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.305
No, I'm not gonna ease up!

07:52.889 --> 07:54.432
Andy, you are 26 years old.

07:54.515 --> 07:58.060
What is wrong with you?
We can't be teenagers forever.

08:00.938 --> 08:03.316
You're right. Look at me.

08:05.693 --> 08:07.278
I'm a joke.

08:08.738 --> 08:09.739
I gotta go.

08:11.657 --> 08:14.452
Man, you've had a twig in your butt
ever since you got here.

08:14.535 --> 08:16.037
If you're so miserable,
why'd you even come?

08:17.205 --> 08:19.499
At this point, I don't even know.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.014
Hello?

08:36.140 --> 08:38.558
Hey, Trace. It's me.

08:41.229 --> 08:42.563
Are you there?

08:42.647 --> 08:44.899
Yes. What do you want, Andy?

08:45.858 --> 08:48.110
I'm sorry I've been
out of touch for a while.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.195
You're sorry?

08:49.278 --> 08:52.198
Well, I guess that means
everything's forgiven.

08:53.491 --> 08:55.326
I just wanted to see how you're doing.

08:56.452 --> 08:58.162
I thought maybe I could talk to Nathan.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.584
I don't think that's a good idea.

09:04.168 --> 09:07.797
You can't just waltz in and out
of our lives whenever it suits you.

09:07.880 --> 09:11.050
Mom, who is that?

09:11.968 --> 09:12.969
No one.

09:21.310 --> 09:25.398
♪ You make me want you
Every time that you run away ♪

09:25.481 --> 09:26.816
♪ You got me chasing you down... ♪

09:26.899 --> 09:28.484
Well, well, well.

09:28.568 --> 09:32.280
If it isn't the grand dame
of the Camp Firewood theater scene.

09:33.030 --> 09:34.031
Go away, Logan.

09:34.115 --> 09:35.116
Oh, you want me to leave?

09:35.199 --> 09:36.826
Is this your barn, too,
just like the theater?

09:38.286 --> 09:39.412
Garth left me.

09:41.163 --> 09:42.206
Oh, my God.

09:44.792 --> 09:45.960
I'm so sorry.

09:46.043 --> 09:48.963
I was so stupid.

09:49.046 --> 09:50.047
Come here, you.

09:51.257 --> 09:54.677
You weren't stupid.
You were just in love.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.388
Hey, do you want to dance?

09:59.849 --> 10:01.183
No.

♪ Wish I could tell you
It was me in your backyard ♪

10:04.687 --> 10:06.522
♪ I left your sneakers, speakers... ♪

10:20.119 --> 10:22.705
- We need a map.
- Boys...

10:23.581 --> 10:24.874
you know what to do.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.676
This should do the trick.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.178
Okay, downloading.

10:39.263 --> 10:42.016
Come on. Come on!

10:43.392 --> 10:44.935
-Come on!
-Come on!

10:45.895 --> 10:47.897
Come on!

10:47.980 --> 10:49.523
Come on!

10:50.358 --> 10:51.359
Oh, come on!

10:52.234 --> 10:53.736
Yes! Got it.

10:59.158 --> 11:00.159
This way.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.079
Can I tell you something?

11:04.038 --> 11:06.040
The only reason I'm back here at Firewood

11:06.123 --> 11:09.502
is 'cause I blew my big audition
in the Berkshires for summer stock .

11:10.086 --> 11:13.464
I know I can make it
in this business, okay?

11:13.547 --> 11:17.009
But if someone doesn't give me a break,
I don't know how I'll do it.

11:17.093 --> 11:20.471
You'll make it, Logan.
You're too talented not to.

11:20.554 --> 11:24.183
It wasn't a mÃ©nage, per se.
Yaron was mostly coaching.

11:24.266 --> 11:25.309
Well?

11:25.935 --> 11:27.978
-Well, what?
-Let me see it.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.148
Oh...

11:31.232 --> 11:32.233
Okay.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.113
Here it is.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.656
- Whoa!
- Yeah.

11:38.739 --> 11:42.326
Look at that thing!
Looks like a train ran over it.

11:42.410 --> 11:43.327
Well done!

11:43.411 --> 11:46.414
Thank you, Abby.
That means so much, coming from you.

11:49.959 --> 11:52.670
-You could put it back in again.
-Okay.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.510
Missile should be in here.

12:03.389 --> 12:04.432
This is a fallout barrier.

12:05.599 --> 12:07.184
The steel's gotta be two feet thick.

12:07.268 --> 12:10.646
We'll never get through it.
I know about steel. I'm made of it.

12:10.729 --> 12:13.023
Stand back. We got this.

12:14.733 --> 12:15.901
You ready?

12:22.116 --> 12:25.286
Sorry about Ginny. What a bummer.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.497
Yeah. It is.

12:29.915 --> 12:35.045
You know, I've been thinking
about what you said at the barn before.

12:35.129 --> 12:38.048
Maybe we should...
give it a chance, you and me.

12:38.132 --> 12:42.928
Oh, Coop, maybe we just got caught up
in all that camp nostalgia.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.263
But you should be with Ginny.

12:45.306 --> 12:48.851
Yeah, but that's...
See, that's not an option anymore.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.936
So I'm saying that's why
it should be you and me.

12:51.020 --> 12:55.024
I understand, and you know
that I care about you so much.

12:55.107 --> 12:58.527
I just don't want to be
a rebound girlfriend.

12:59.361 --> 13:04.033
Maybe at our 20th reunion,
we'll both be in a better place.

13:04.116 --> 13:06.202
Wait a second. What?

13:20.090 --> 13:24.762
Ahoy, mateys! I see dry land.

13:25.721 --> 13:30.476
You know, between our videotape series
and our unborn child, life is complete.

13:30.559 --> 13:32.186
What should we name the baby?

13:32.269 --> 13:34.355
Zephaniah if it's a boy
and Hephzibah if it's a girl.

13:34.438 --> 13:36.440
Hebrew is such a beautiful--

13:37.358 --> 13:38.943
-Oh, my gosh!
-What is this?

13:39.026 --> 13:40.945
There's no time to explain.
Where is everyone?

13:41.028 --> 13:42.613
-They're at the dance.
-Let's show you.

13:42.696 --> 13:43.906
Let's go. Come on.

13:43.989 --> 13:46.617
You telling me that you've been
thinking about me all this time,

13:46.700 --> 13:48.994
and now that I'm actually single,
you don't even want to be with me anymore?

13:49.078 --> 13:50.287
But that's not fair, Coop.

13:50.371 --> 13:52.623
I didn't know you had a fiancÃ©e
when I came here this weekend.

13:52.706 --> 13:54.792
-You can't put that on me.
-The only thing I know is,

13:54.875 --> 13:57.253
if I hadn't come here this weekend,
I'd still be engaged.

13:57.336 --> 14:01.048
Oh, I am so sorry that my presence here
is such a disaster for you, Coop.

14:01.131 --> 14:03.968
This whole reunion was a mistake.

14:04.843 --> 14:06.262
You're drunk, aren't you?

14:06.345 --> 14:07.846
Whatever!

14:07.930 --> 14:11.642
Hey, guys! Can I have your attention?

14:11.725 --> 14:15.145
I thought it might be nice to have
one of our former campers

14:15.229 --> 14:19.149
speak to what the spirit has meant to him
throughout the years.

14:19.233 --> 14:23.153
So please help me welcome Coop!

14:39.336 --> 14:41.714
I spent nine summers at Firewood.

14:42.548 --> 14:46.093
During that time,
the spirit of Camp Firewood

14:46.176 --> 14:48.762
was as much a part of my experience

14:48.846 --> 14:53.267
as all of the first kisses,
hikes, cookouts...

14:53.851 --> 14:56.186
and all the last-night dances combined.

14:57.646 --> 14:59.440
Now that I've been out
in the real world a little bit,

14:59.523 --> 15:01.901
I'm here to tell you
one thing I know for sure.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.696
And that one thing...

15:07.740 --> 15:10.993
is that the spirit of Camp Firewood
is bullshit.

15:12.369 --> 15:13.412
It's not real.

15:13.495 --> 15:17.249
There's no magic out in the forest.

15:17.833 --> 15:21.754
It's just some crap
they put in the pamphlets

15:21.837 --> 15:23.964
so that the parents
can feel warm and fuzzy

15:24.048 --> 15:28.260
about sending their children away
to sleepaway camp for eight weeks.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.722
'Cause spirit doesn't pay the rent!

15:32.723 --> 15:38.228
And spirit doesn't put food in your belly,
or a shirt on your back.

15:39.355 --> 15:44.568
And spirit doesn't help you
from feeling lost...

15:46.028 --> 15:47.363
and unloved.

15:49.531 --> 15:54.078
Spirit of Camp Firewood is a nice idea,
but it's not real.

15:54.870 --> 15:56.497
And it never was.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.875
And it never will be.

16:06.465 --> 16:09.843
I guess I just found
the last chapter to my novel.

16:12.221 --> 16:13.597
Everything sucks.

16:14.890 --> 16:16.016
The end.

16:21.814 --> 16:25.818
Okay, I guess that's how
they used to party in 1981.

16:25.901 --> 16:28.529
Well, here's how we do it in '91.

16:32.783 --> 16:34.827
-Guys! Emergency!
-What is it?

16:34.910 --> 16:36.745
President Reagan's coming
to destroy Camp Firewood.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.623
We have to evacuate immediately.
Now! Let's go!

16:42.793 --> 16:45.004
Come on, guys, hurry!

16:54.096 --> 16:55.931
Oh, God, this is bad!

16:58.017 --> 17:00.019
Missile in launch position.

17:01.145 --> 17:04.606
Welcome to the last day of camp...

17:05.441 --> 17:06.275
ever!

17:06.358 --> 17:07.401
We need to run!

17:08.027 --> 17:10.112
The time for running is over.

17:10.194 --> 17:13.240
Now is the time for dying!

17:13.323 --> 17:15.867
Let me introduce you to Jelly Bean.

17:15.951 --> 17:18.287
- Jelly B!
- What does he mean by that?

17:18.369 --> 17:20.414
Jelly Bean is the name of the missile.

17:20.497 --> 17:22.249
I gave it that name.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.835
That's not really its name, is it?

17:25.419 --> 17:28.130
We're too late.
Half of this nuke is above ground now.

17:28.213 --> 17:30.299
We can't disarm the warhead
from down here.

17:30.382 --> 17:33.802
Nope, but if I can find a way
into the defense network,

17:33.886 --> 17:35.179
there might be another solution.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.598
And this terminal
just might be our ticket.

17:37.681 --> 17:38.766
I don't understand.

17:38.849 --> 17:41.310
How's a computer gonna stop
a goddamn nuke?

17:41.393 --> 17:44.980
It's complicated, but it's called
the Strategic Defense Initiative,

17:45.064 --> 17:46.356
also known as Star Wars.

17:46.440 --> 17:49.943
An interlocking system of satellites
that can destroy missiles in space.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.696
Reagan spent billions researching it.

17:53.280 --> 17:57.242
The public thought it was never completed,
but secretly, it was.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.621
-Should be online now.
-Hold tight.

18:07.336 --> 18:09.088
-Says "no missile detected."
-Damn it!

18:09.171 --> 18:10.130
What's that mean?

18:10.214 --> 18:13.634
What it means is that Reagan must have
disabled the missile's tracking system.

18:13.717 --> 18:16.178
Until it's activated, we're flying blind!

18:16.261 --> 18:17.971
We gotta get to that tracking system,

18:18.055 --> 18:19.807
which is located
in the top of this missile.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.517
Ah...

18:21.600 --> 18:24.770
-All the way up there? Above ground?
-Yeah.

18:24.853 --> 18:27.356
That's a suicide mission.
We'd never come back alive.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.817
Reagan's security would see to that.

18:29.900 --> 18:32.277
I'd rather die a hero than live a coward.

18:32.361 --> 18:33.570
Let's go, brother.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.906
If Eric and I manage
to turn on that tracker,

18:35.989 --> 18:36.990
you know what to do.

18:38.242 --> 18:41.370
Somebody do something!

18:41.453 --> 18:43.163
Calm down, J.J.

18:43.247 --> 18:44.706
There's gotta be something
we can do!

18:44.790 --> 18:48.043
There's nothing you can do.
The countdown has already begun.

18:48.669 --> 18:51.922
By the time the bomb explodes,
I'll be long gone.

18:52.005 --> 18:54.758
Enjoy your last precious moments
of life, campers.

18:57.553 --> 18:58.887
We're all fucked!

19:00.597 --> 19:02.641
No! You're not!

19:02.724 --> 19:04.685
What?

19:04.768 --> 19:07.646
Sorry I missed the reunion, guys.
I had to work.

19:07.729 --> 19:09.106
I love your show!

19:09.189 --> 19:10.983
Yeah, it is a really good show.

19:11.066 --> 19:12.526
- Thanks.
- My mom loves you, too.

19:12.609 --> 19:13.485
Top five.

19:13.569 --> 19:16.989
Former President Reagan
is not here to settle an old score.

19:17.072 --> 19:21.618
Oh, no. He's here to destroy evidence.

19:22.536 --> 19:24.371
- Evidence?
- What evidence?

19:24.454 --> 19:27.166
Evidence of his humanity.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.293
His frailty.

19:29.376 --> 19:33.755
For long before President Reagan
was leader of the free world,

19:33.839 --> 19:39.136
he was just a young boy who came
to this very summer camp in 1921.

19:39.219 --> 19:40.596
It's not true.

19:40.679 --> 19:42.181
And he wasn't just any camper.

19:42.764 --> 19:46.643
Oh, no. He was a legend.
Weren't you, sir?

19:46.727 --> 19:48.020
I...

19:48.103 --> 19:52.816
For Ronald Wilson Reagan
is none other than

19:52.900 --> 19:55.110
Little Willie-Shits-His-Pants.

19:56.778 --> 19:58.363
It's not true!

19:58.447 --> 20:00.449
Ronald Wilson Reagan!

20:00.532 --> 20:04.203
Don't you see?
Willie is short for Wilson!

20:04.786 --> 20:07.164
-You're right!
-Willie is short for Wilson!

20:16.924 --> 20:17.966
Oh, hi, boys.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.177
You gotta get outta here. You're not safe.

20:20.260 --> 20:22.888
Actually, boys, it's you who aren't safe.

20:22.971 --> 20:25.474
You don't get it.
Reagan is here, and he has a nuke.

20:25.557 --> 20:26.683
Oh, I get it.

20:28.644 --> 20:32.189
The only question is... do you get it?

20:35.901 --> 20:37.110
She's the mole.

20:38.487 --> 20:40.739
She's been the mole the whole time.

20:42.032 --> 20:44.660
I don't know what they're paying you,
but this is madness.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.703
Thousands of lives are at stake.

20:46.787 --> 20:51.875
The only madness is you thinking
I'm gonna let you anywhere near that nuke.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.044
Gene, careful.

20:54.127 --> 20:57.756
That's preposterous!
Me? Little Willie-Shits-His-Pants?

20:57.839 --> 20:59.675
How could you make such an accusation?

20:59.758 --> 21:02.803
Because I found your dance partner.

21:04.721 --> 21:08.809
Meet Vivian Larson,
Firewood class of 1921.

21:08.892 --> 21:09.768
Vivian.

21:10.727 --> 21:12.980
Vivian, why don't you tell the story?

21:13.981 --> 21:17.025
I remember it like it was yesterday.

21:17.818 --> 21:20.320
We were too shy to talk to each other,

21:20.404 --> 21:23.240
but I had a crush on Willie
all summer long.

21:24.866 --> 21:27.411
Finally, it was the end of summer dance.

21:27.494 --> 21:30.163
It seemed like everyone in camp
had found their match.

21:30.664 --> 21:32.791
Everyone but me, that is.

21:32.874 --> 21:35.544
And Willie was on the other side
of the barn,

21:35.627 --> 21:37.754
too nervous to ask me to the floor.

21:37.838 --> 21:43.635
But then my favorite ditty,
"Meet Me Tonight in Dreamland," came on,

21:44.344 --> 21:48.265
and I don't know what came over me,
but I just marched across that floor,

21:48.348 --> 21:51.893
walked right up to Willie,
and extended my hand.

21:51.977 --> 21:55.355
Girls did not ask boys to the dance floor.

21:55.439 --> 21:59.651
Everyone stared, but I paid them no mind.

22:00.652 --> 22:05.198
It was the most wonderful moment
of my young life.

22:05.282 --> 22:06.491
Until...

22:12.539 --> 22:14.458
Oh, no. It's happening.

22:24.009 --> 22:28.555
It was the roundest,
most perfect dookie you ever did see.

22:29.264 --> 22:31.183
Little Willie shits his pants!

22:31.266 --> 22:33.185
Little Willie shits his pants!

22:33.268 --> 22:37.355
And that's how the legend of
Little Willie-Shits-His-Pants was born.

22:37.439 --> 22:38.482
Aw...

22:41.109 --> 22:43.195
-Hello, Willie.
-Vivian.

22:45.030 --> 22:49.409
After that turd
rolled out of my pant leg...

22:50.619 --> 22:54.164
I ran into the woods
and never stopped running.

22:54.998 --> 22:56.875
I guess, in a lot of ways,

22:56.958 --> 23:00.545
I've been running from that moment
my entire life.

23:00.629 --> 23:05.342
My one regret is that
we never did get to finish that dance.

23:06.802 --> 23:07.844
Sir...

23:08.595 --> 23:09.805
there's still time.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.516
May I have this dance, Mr. President?

23:12.599 --> 23:15.227
Oh, Vivian, of course.

23:15.310 --> 23:19.940
♪ Meet me tonight in dreamland ♪

23:20.023 --> 23:23.819
♪ Under the silvery moon ♪

23:24.528 --> 23:25.612
Let us pass, Nancy.

23:25.695 --> 23:28.240
Nancy, you're way out of your league here.

23:28.323 --> 23:29.950
I don't want to hit a nurse.

23:35.747 --> 23:37.666
Nancy, we don't have to do this.

23:37.749 --> 23:39.042
Oh, yes, we do.

23:46.842 --> 23:48.760
Sorry.

23:53.140 --> 23:55.976
You get to the missile.
I'll try to hold her off.

23:56.560 --> 23:57.978
It's suicide!

24:00.063 --> 24:02.232
It's a life well-lived.

24:12.993 --> 24:16.079
♪ ...love-light gleaming ♪

24:16.163 --> 24:19.332

24:23.545 --> 24:24.796
Let him go, Nancy.

24:24.880 --> 24:27.507
Gail, you came back!

24:27.591 --> 24:30.468
Oh, look.
It's the arts and crafts counselor.

24:30.552 --> 24:31.970
Still looking for a husband?

24:32.053 --> 24:34.389
Right now,
I'm only looking for two things.

24:34.472 --> 24:37.517
A class on how to make your own
paper-machÃ© pencil holder,

24:37.601 --> 24:39.019
and an ass to kick.

24:39.102 --> 24:40.312
And it looks like I missed the class

24:40.395 --> 24:42.272
on how to make your own
paper-machÃ© pencil holder.

24:42.355 --> 24:45.025
That means you're gonna kick her ass.

24:45.108 --> 24:47.110
Too bad you won't be around to see it.

24:49.112 --> 24:49.946
Gene!

24:50.030 --> 24:53.658
Why?

24:53.742 --> 24:55.994
Gene!

24:56.077 --> 25:01.333
♪ Meet me tonight in dreamland ♪

25:01.416 --> 25:02.834
Oh, no.

25:03.835 --> 25:05.587
It's happening again.

25:07.088 --> 25:08.298
Doo-doo.

25:09.466 --> 25:12.260
Oh, Ronald, you can make it.

25:12.844 --> 25:13.929
Focus on me.

25:14.596 --> 25:16.348
Look into my eyes.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.901
Wench, you gonna die.

25:27.984 --> 25:29.569
Bring it, sister.

25:30.403 --> 25:31.655
-Come on, Ronny.
-Hold it in.

25:31.738 --> 25:33.782
-You can do it.
-Don't do it.

25:33.865 --> 25:35.867
-Come on, Ron.
-Breathe through it.

25:35.951 --> 25:38.495
You can do it, Ronny.

25:38.578 --> 25:40.247
My bowels are settling.

25:40.330 --> 25:42.624
Yes!

25:42.707 --> 25:44.292
-They're settling.
-Yeah!

25:44.376 --> 25:46.044
Way to not shit!

25:46.127 --> 25:49.464
Oh, Vivian, thank you for the dance.

25:49.547 --> 25:51.174
You look as beautiful as ever.

25:53.009 --> 25:55.262
I wanted to destroy the camp...

25:56.471 --> 26:00.392
because I wanted to destroy the memory
of what happened that day.

26:00.475 --> 26:03.228
It was a wound that could not heal.

26:04.854 --> 26:05.897
But it is gone now...

26:06.982 --> 26:09.776
and I no longer want to destroy the camp.

26:10.944 --> 26:13.196
Firewood is safe.

26:17.033 --> 26:18.201
Good job, Ron.

26:18.285 --> 26:21.746
Uh, Mr. President, it's great that
you don't want to nuke the camp anymore,

26:21.830 --> 26:23.248
but maybe you should tell the nuke.

26:23.331 --> 26:25.500
Launch to commence
in ten minutes.

26:27.919 --> 26:28.795
Well, if you could.

27:02.620 --> 27:03.663
Gene!

27:04.289 --> 27:07.375
Oh, Gene! Gene. Gene.

27:07.917 --> 27:10.003
Gene. Gene.

27:12.797 --> 27:14.299
Oh, my Gene.

27:14.382 --> 27:18.887
Oh, Gene. Oh, Gene.

27:21.264 --> 27:22.098
Why?

27:22.182 --> 27:25.852
I'll just punch in the disarm code.

27:26.978 --> 27:29.522
One, two, three.

27:29.606 --> 27:31.816
What's this?

27:31.900 --> 27:33.485
One, two, three.

27:33.568 --> 27:35.737
The disarm code isn't working.

27:36.821 --> 27:39.491
That's because I changed it.

27:39.574 --> 27:41.910
- What?
- All I've been hearing about for years

27:42.702 --> 27:46.289
is "President Reagan this,
President Reagan that."

27:46.373 --> 27:48.708
Well, guess what, fuckers?

27:48.792 --> 27:54.339
I'm your president now,
and I demand some goddamn respect!

27:54.422 --> 27:56.091
George, you don't have to do this.

27:56.174 --> 27:59.177
You call me Mr. President,
