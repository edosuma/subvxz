09:49.632 --> 09:52.635
It sounds like Luke and Baxter
are getting along.

09:53.723 --> 09:55.682
I know that laugh.

09:58.510 --> 09:59.511
They're getting ready
to order pizza.

10:04.560 --> 10:05.909
Just my luck.

10:05.996 --> 10:08.303
I got a couple of
idiot nine-year-olds

10:08.390 --> 10:09.609
fixing my roof.

10:09.696 --> 10:12.002
I'm nine.

10:13.569 --> 10:15.571
Nothing to brag about.

10:15.658 --> 10:17.660
BAXTER:
Hey, man, let's order a pizza!

10:24.928 --> 10:25.886
Ow!

10:29.237 --> 10:30.238
Ow!

10:34.459 --> 10:35.635
Ah!

10:36.679 --> 10:37.549
This is fun.

10:41.553 --> 10:42.903
What are you doing?

10:42.990 --> 10:43.555
Working.

10:45.601 --> 10:47.516
I knew I should've
handled this myself.

10:47.603 --> 10:50.345
Christy, it's done.

10:50.432 --> 10:52.086
Look. All sealed.

10:52.173 --> 10:53.478
Just got to let it dry

10:53.565 --> 10:55.132
and put the shingles
on tomorrow.

10:55.219 --> 10:57.047
Oh.

10:57.134 --> 10:58.266
Okay.

10:58.353 --> 11:00.094
Good.

11:00.181 --> 11:02.444
Just promise me
you'll be careful.

11:02.531 --> 11:03.619
Promise.

11:03.706 --> 11:05.186
I don't care if you get high.

11:05.273 --> 11:07.057
I just don't want anybody
getting hurt.

11:07.144 --> 11:09.669
We are not getting high.

11:13.107 --> 11:14.630
She knows, dude.

11:16.980 --> 11:18.721
Relax.
We're being real safe.

11:18.808 --> 11:21.332
Thank you.

11:21.419 --> 11:23.073
No, no, no, no, no!

11:23.160 --> 11:24.161
[crashing]

11:27.121 --> 11:29.471
Oh. She tensed up.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.700
It was so smart
to save this.

11:43.180 --> 11:44.921
Another vomit-related injury?

11:45.008 --> 11:46.401
[sighs]

11:46.488 --> 11:47.445
No.

11:47.532 --> 11:48.577
Slammed it in a car door.

11:48.664 --> 11:50.057
Drunk?Acid.

11:50.144 --> 11:51.319
Ah.

11:51.406 --> 11:54.409
Thought I was invisible.

11:54.496 --> 11:57.151
[sighs] I can't believe
you're going to work.

11:57.238 --> 11:58.630
Why not?

11:58.718 --> 11:59.980
Your ankle's the size
of a grapefruit.

12:00.067 --> 12:02.069
You just fell off
a freaking ladder.

12:02.156 --> 12:03.548
It's a miracle you're not
driving a wheelchair

12:03.635 --> 12:05.159
with your tongue.

12:05.246 --> 12:07.074
I'm fine.

12:07.161 --> 12:08.553
It's just a sprain...

12:12.993 --> 12:14.298
What are you
trying to prove?

12:14.385 --> 12:15.038
[sighs]

12:15.125 --> 12:15.865
Nothing.

12:15.952 --> 12:18.563
I have a job.

12:18.650 --> 12:20.522
I've got bills,
I've got obligations...

12:20.609 --> 12:21.871
[keys clatter to floor]

12:24.134 --> 12:25.745
Would you like me
to pick that up for you?

12:26.789 --> 12:28.878
No. Thank you.

12:46.591 --> 12:49.246
Oh...

12:51.509 --> 12:53.120
Got it!

12:56.601 --> 12:58.647
Soup's up.

12:58.734 --> 13:00.954
Oh, God.

13:01.041 --> 13:02.607
Not more soup.

13:02.694 --> 13:05.567
Careful.

13:05.654 --> 13:07.525
Very hot.

13:09.571 --> 13:10.746
I'll see you in hell.

13:13.227 --> 13:14.750
[gasps]

13:14.837 --> 13:15.751
Ah...

13:15.838 --> 13:16.883
Ow.

13:16.970 --> 13:18.362
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

13:18.449 --> 13:20.756
Ow, ow, ow.

13:20.843 --> 13:21.757
Ow, ow, ow.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.019
Ow.

13:23.106 --> 13:24.934
Why is this
so enjoyable?

13:25.021 --> 13:28.416
I think 'cause
we're bad people.

13:29.939 --> 13:31.898
[gasps]

13:32.942 --> 13:34.639
Son of a bitch.

13:36.772 --> 13:38.513
Hot, hot, hot, hot.

13:38.600 --> 13:39.166
Hot, hot, hot.

13:39.253 --> 13:41.690
Ah, hot.

13:41.777 --> 13:43.953
Ah... hot.

13:44.040 --> 13:44.954
Ah...

13:45.041 --> 13:45.607
ah... ah...

13:45.694 --> 13:47.609
[panting]

13:47.696 --> 13:48.697
Ah...

13:50.786 --> 13:51.743
Ah... ooh...

13:51.831 --> 13:53.833
[panting]

13:57.967 --> 14:00.709
Uh...

14:00.796 --> 14:03.930
It appears we are
out of soup.

14:18.727 --> 14:19.641
Mmm.

14:19.728 --> 14:21.034
[door closes]

14:21.121 --> 14:22.078
What are you doing
back so early?

14:22.165 --> 14:23.993
Oh...

14:24.080 --> 14:26.039
Gabriel sent me home.

14:26.126 --> 14:26.604
He didn't fire you,
did he?

14:26.691 --> 14:29.303
No.

14:29.390 --> 14:31.566
The one perk to having slept
with your married boss

14:31.653 --> 14:33.655
is job security.

14:36.266 --> 14:37.702
Why don't you relax
and I'll make dinner?

14:37.789 --> 14:38.965
No, I got it.

14:39.052 --> 14:41.054
Christy...I said I got it!

14:48.539 --> 14:52.500
[sobbing loudly]

14:52.587 --> 14:54.415
[sobbing]:
I don't got it.

14:54.502 --> 14:56.199
[Christy sniffs]

14:56.286 --> 14:57.722
I don't got it.

14:57.809 --> 14:59.333
What's that I hear?

14:59.420 --> 15:01.030
Was that a cry for help?

15:03.903 --> 15:05.905
I'm done.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.820
There's nothing left.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.475
[sniffs]

15:11.562 --> 15:14.043
I still didn't hear
the word "help."

15:18.743 --> 15:19.962
Help.

15:24.749 --> 15:26.751
[sobbing]Oh...

15:28.753 --> 15:29.885
Come here.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.191
Let's get you into bed,

15:31.278 --> 15:32.670
and I will cook us all
a nice dinner.

15:32.757 --> 15:34.803
Thank you.

15:34.890 --> 15:35.891
[sniffs]

15:38.024 --> 15:39.939
How do you feel
about some hot soup?

15:44.856 --> 15:47.381
Thanks for helping out, man.

15:47.468 --> 15:48.991
My pleasure.

15:49.078 --> 15:50.645
Pitching in around here
makes me feel better

15:50.732 --> 15:53.822
about being late with
the child support payments.

15:53.909 --> 15:56.303
You'll understand
that soon enough.

15:59.045 --> 16:00.350
I really appreciate
you talking me

16:00.437 --> 16:01.308
through this whole
baby thing.

16:01.395 --> 16:03.179
Ah, it was nothing.

16:03.266 --> 16:05.007
No, man, it was
a big help.

16:05.094 --> 16:06.704
I would give you

16:06.791 --> 16:09.403
a "world's greatest dad"
T-shirt unironically.

16:12.493 --> 16:15.975
Wow. Thanks.

16:16.062 --> 16:18.194
I don't get a lot of
positive feedback.

16:19.848 --> 16:22.024
All right.

16:22.111 --> 16:23.025
Enough emotion.

16:23.112 --> 16:24.331
Let's get baked.

16:24.418 --> 16:26.681
Right.

16:28.378 --> 16:30.206
I'm just so tired.

16:30.293 --> 16:32.426
That's because you don't
let anybody help you.

16:32.513 --> 16:33.862
[sighs]
I would,

16:33.949 --> 16:35.385
but then things
don't get done right.

16:35.472 --> 16:38.084
Before you know it,
everything's falling apart.

16:38.171 --> 16:40.477
Stop tucking.
I'm not a burrito.

16:41.696 --> 16:43.219
Sorry.

16:43.306 --> 16:44.090
And you don't know how
to fluff a pillow.

16:44.177 --> 16:46.005
Oh, go fluff yourself.

16:48.224 --> 16:49.138
Sure.

16:49.225 --> 16:50.357
Abandon me.

16:50.444 --> 16:51.532
That's how this all started.

16:51.619 --> 16:53.055
Come again?

16:53.142 --> 16:54.709
Forget it.

16:54.796 --> 16:56.276
No, you-you seriously think

16:56.363 --> 16:57.016
I'm the reason
you're a control freak?

16:59.061 --> 17:00.236
You seriously don't?

17:00.323 --> 17:02.195
Here we go.

17:02.282 --> 17:05.762
Welcome back to another exciting
episode of Blaming Bonnie!

17:05.849 --> 17:07.765
As far back as I can remember,

17:07.852 --> 17:08.896
I came home every night
to an empty house.

17:08.983 --> 17:12.291
Ah, I've seen this one.

17:12.378 --> 17:13.902
If I didn't cook dinner,
I didn't eat.

17:13.989 --> 17:15.512
At least the fridge
was filled with food.

17:15.598 --> 17:17.079
Don't you dare defend yourself!

17:17.165 --> 17:18.602
But I provided. I...No, no, no, no, no! No!

17:18.689 --> 17:20.517
This is not a conversation.

17:20.604 --> 17:22.258
Do I have
to remind you

17:22.345 --> 17:23.390
that I raised myself?

17:23.477 --> 17:25.521
I did my own
laundry,

17:25.608 --> 17:26.915
I made my own lunches,

17:27.002 --> 17:28.699
I hitchhiked to school.

17:28.786 --> 17:30.527
What's that got to do with

17:30.614 --> 17:33.313
you being a bitter, angry,
resentful woman right now?

17:35.924 --> 17:38.883
I said this is not
a conversation!

17:43.584 --> 17:44.324
[deep voice]:
Hey, dude.

17:44.411 --> 17:46.717
Pass the joy.

17:48.850 --> 17:50.112
I don't have it.

17:50.199 --> 17:52.158
I don't have it, either.

17:54.116 --> 17:55.509
[chuckles]

17:55.596 --> 17:58.381
Too bad it's not a phone.
We could call it.

17:58.468 --> 17:59.861
[laughing]

17:59.948 --> 18:00.862
Whoa.

18:00.949 --> 18:03.082
What?

18:04.126 --> 18:05.954
This is amazing weed.

18:06.041 --> 18:07.912
I can see your farts!

18:11.916 --> 18:16.182
Awesome.

18:16.269 --> 18:18.053
Do you honestly believe
you have to remind me

18:18.140 --> 18:20.186
how much I screwed up?

18:20.273 --> 18:21.578
You don't think
I carry that with me

18:21.665 --> 18:23.537
every minute
of every freaking day?

18:23.624 --> 18:24.581
Do you?

18:24.668 --> 18:25.408
The actual amount of time

18:25.495 --> 18:27.018
is not important.

18:28.759 --> 18:30.239
All you need to know

18:30.326 --> 18:32.111
is I am trying to be here
for you right now,

18:32.198 --> 18:34.852
and you can stop beating me up
for who I used to be,

18:34.939 --> 18:36.027
because I've got that covered.

18:39.596 --> 18:41.294
But I like beating you up.

18:44.949 --> 18:46.342
How's this for a plan?

18:46.429 --> 18:48.736
You can blame me
for all your problems

18:48.823 --> 18:51.434
on Tuesdays, Thursdays
and Sundays.

18:51.521 --> 18:53.871
I'll punish myself
the rest of the week.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.353
Well, it is Monday.

18:59.007 --> 19:00.748
All right.

19:00.835 --> 19:03.229
I was a terrible mother.

19:03.316 --> 19:04.665
And I let you down,

19:04.752 --> 19:07.711
and nobody hates me
more than me.

19:07.798 --> 19:09.539
How's that?

19:12.238 --> 19:14.414
It would've been better
if you cried.

19:16.851 --> 19:18.853
I'll work on it.

19:21.943 --> 19:23.205
I'm so sorry, baby.

19:26.077 --> 19:27.078
Aw...

19:31.082 --> 19:33.172
Do you smell something?

19:35.130 --> 19:38.220
[deep voice]:
Uh-oh.

19:42.224 --> 19:45.184
You were so smart
to save this.

19:46.402 --> 19:47.447
Thanks.

19:47.534 --> 19:49.623
It's the herbal tea, right?

19:49.710 --> 19:51.059
As you requested.

19:51.146 --> 19:52.452
Just checking.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.981
Purple's such
a pretty color.

20:00.068 --> 20:01.417
It doesn't
feel pretty.

20:05.160 --> 20:08.250
I do love taking
care of you.

20:08.337 --> 20:10.426
I love it, too, Mom.

20:10.513 --> 20:11.688
Well... probably
should've done it

20:11.775 --> 20:12.646
when you were a kid.

20:12.733 --> 20:14.169
That would've been nice.

20:18.129 --> 20:20.131
[thunder rumbles]

20:22.612 --> 20:24.223
[exhales]
Gotta hand it Baxter.

20:24.310 --> 20:26.660
He did a good
job up there.

20:26.747 --> 20:28.009
Yeah, he did.

20:28.096 --> 20:29.837
I'm hard on him, but...

20:29.924 --> 20:31.055
he is trying
to step up.

20:31.142 --> 20:33.144
Maybe people can change.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.669
[water drips]

20:38.715 --> 20:40.674
Or maybe not.

20:42.197 --> 20:43.503
[pops lips]

20:43.590 --> 20:44.982
If it makes you
feel any better,

20:45.069 --> 20:46.332
I forgot you wanted herbal.
