00:13.541 --> 00:19.125


00:19.208 --> 00:22.416


00:22.500 --> 00:25.625


00:57.000 --> 01:00.500


01:14.166 --> 01:17.083
So, you got that package?

01:17.166 --> 01:18.083
Yeah.

01:21.375 --> 01:23.166
One box of grenades.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.916
Two sacks of gunpowder.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.291
A spool of piano wire.

01:29.083 --> 01:31.166
And one tube of toothpaste.

01:31.666 --> 01:33.000
Spearmint.

01:34.125 --> 01:38.333
Nobody procures black-market goods
like you do, Porkrind.

01:38.833 --> 01:40.916
Shh! Don't use my real name!

01:41.000 --> 01:43.916
I like to keep a low profile.

01:44.916 --> 01:46.791
Hi, Porkrind!

01:49.583 --> 01:55.083
Today's the day, Porkrind.
We've been saving up our chore nickels!

01:55.166 --> 01:57.375
Can you guess
what we're gonna spend them on?

01:57.458 --> 01:58.416


01:58.500 --> 01:59.333
No.

01:59.416 --> 02:02.583
The greatest game
in all the Inkwell Isles.

02:02.666 --> 02:05.208
Also, it's a little bit scary.

02:05.291 --> 02:08.083
<i>Dirk Dangerous vs. the Volcano!</i>

02:11.333 --> 02:13.125
-Nickel me.

02:35.583 --> 02:38.291
Danger! Danger! Danger!

02:40.000 --> 02:40.916
Oh.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.208
Hey, Porkrind! Whatcha doin'?

02:43.291 --> 02:45.583
-That looks neat.
-Not for you.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.708
-What's in this jar?
-Hands off.

02:47.791 --> 02:49.958
-What about this?
-Classified.

02:52.250 --> 02:53.916
Whoa! Porkrind!

02:54.000 --> 02:55.166
A shoe!

02:55.250 --> 02:57.833
I found a shoe on the road
and put it on my foot.

02:57.916 --> 03:00.958
The shoe was too small.
I wore it anyway. I lost my shoe earlier.

03:01.041 --> 03:02.541
And it popped right on!

03:02.625 --> 03:05.208
I realized the shoe I found <i>was </i>my shoe!

03:05.291 --> 03:08.583
It wasn't too small.
Just a family of mice living inside.

03:08.666 --> 03:12.041
I named them. Wanna know
what I named them? I named the mama Ding.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.750
I named the papa Ding-Ding.

03:13.833 --> 03:14.958
I named their baby…

03:15.041 --> 03:17.208
-Eee!

03:30.875 --> 03:34.625
Porkrind. Porkrind. Porkrind.

03:34.708 --> 03:40.541
-Hey, Porkrind! Porkrind! Porkrind!

03:40.625 --> 03:44.625
You know, you two would be perfect
for a special job.

03:45.708 --> 03:49.875
Eh, never mind.
It's probably too dangerous.

03:50.583 --> 03:51.875
Dangerous?

03:51.958 --> 03:53.208
Dangerous?

03:54.583 --> 03:57.041
Oh, yeah. Very scary.

03:57.125 --> 04:01.750
I need a delicate package picked up
from this very dangerous location.

04:02.416 --> 04:04.291
"Mt. Eruptus"?!

04:04.791 --> 04:06.625
Mount Eruptus?

04:06.708 --> 04:08.791
Yep. That's the name of the place.

04:08.875 --> 04:13.791
I can sense within you the bravery
required to complete this mission.

04:14.291 --> 04:15.958
You, not so much.

04:17.083 --> 04:20.375
Well, I take offense.
I could be dangerous too.

04:20.458 --> 04:23.166
-Hmph!
-Yeah. Don't wait up for us.

04:29.166 --> 04:31.541
I'm not dangerous. How could I say that?

04:31.625 --> 04:36.000
We gotta back out! I'm not up for this!
I wanna go home!

04:36.750 --> 04:38.125
Oh, brother.

04:38.208 --> 04:39.041
Wait!

04:42.458 --> 04:43.791
Hold on there, Mugsy.

04:43.875 --> 04:46.375
Whenever I need a little extra confidence,

04:46.458 --> 04:48.958
I slap on these Dirk Dangerous goggles.

04:49.041 --> 04:51.791
These things have
some kind of magical power.

04:51.875 --> 04:52.708
Really?

04:52.791 --> 04:55.250
Would I lie
about something this important?

04:55.333 --> 04:59.875
I'm telling you, when I put these on,
I'm infused with confidence and bravery!

05:01.250 --> 05:03.125
Confidence and bravery?

05:04.166 --> 05:06.083
Oh, yeah!

05:06.166 --> 05:09.666
Cuphead, I'm feeling a little dangerous.

05:10.750 --> 05:14.125
That's the spirit!
Next stop, Mount Eruptus!

05:16.125 --> 05:17.250
There she is!

05:21.750 --> 05:23.375
This tub oughta do nicely.

05:28.916 --> 05:32.000
Shouldn't we get the one
that's <i>most </i>seaworthy?

05:32.083 --> 05:36.375
Dirk Dangerous doesn't do seaworthy.
He does dangerous.

05:36.458 --> 05:37.291
Ho, ho!

05:37.375 --> 05:38.500
Now you're talking!

05:41.708 --> 05:43.791
I gotta tell you, Mug… man,

05:43.875 --> 05:45.625
now that you're so dangerous,

05:46.125 --> 05:50.416
I'm… even more excited
for this… adventure!

05:50.500 --> 05:53.083
Just wait till we go over the falls.

05:54.208 --> 05:55.333
The falls?!

06:03.625 --> 06:05.291
That was…

06:05.375 --> 06:07.000
sensational!

06:08.083 --> 06:09.750
You just follow me, Cuphead.

06:09.833 --> 06:14.583
These goggles give me a sense of adventure
you can't possibly comprehend.

06:18.375 --> 06:19.916
-What? What happened?
-Uh…

06:20.000 --> 06:25.458
Nothing! You just, uh, look so brave
in your goggles, which you're wearing,

06:25.541 --> 06:27.166
is all I wanted to say.

06:27.833 --> 06:29.250
Great. Let's move.

06:47.041 --> 06:48.125
Ow, ow, ow!

06:50.458 --> 06:52.125
-Phew!

06:52.208 --> 06:53.291


06:55.833 --> 06:57.083


06:57.958 --> 06:59.625
-

07:07.041 --> 07:10.750
Come on, Cuphead!
We gotta prove Porkrind wrong!

07:10.833 --> 07:13.791
Maybe we've had
enough danger for one day?

07:13.875 --> 07:16.750
We don't even know
what this delicate package is!

07:16.833 --> 07:18.750
Oh, yes, we do!

07:20.416 --> 07:22.208
Eggs are delicate packages.

07:33.250 --> 07:34.333
Ow!

07:34.416 --> 07:37.708
If we don't turn back, we're gonna die!

07:37.791 --> 07:41.041
Trust the goggles.
They haven't failed us yet.

07:41.125 --> 07:45.083
You lost the goggles!
You haven't been wearing them for hours!

07:45.666 --> 07:46.875
No… No goggles?

07:51.166 --> 07:52.875
No goggles?!

07:53.708 --> 07:54.958


07:55.041 --> 07:57.541
This is bad. This is bad!

08:05.125 --> 08:08.500
I'm sorry, Mugsy.
I shoulda told you the goggles came off.

08:08.583 --> 08:10.500
Now we're gonna die!

08:11.958 --> 08:14.333
Wait. If I wasn't wearing the goggles,

08:14.416 --> 08:17.291
that means I did
that dangerous stuff without them!

08:17.375 --> 08:18.750
Don't you see, Cuphead?

08:18.833 --> 08:22.625
The goggles were inside me
this whole time!

08:23.208 --> 08:25.458
Gross. But I see your point.

08:26.083 --> 08:27.375
Watch this.

08:32.041 --> 08:32.875
Ah!

08:37.416 --> 08:39.000
-Whoa!

09:09.666 --> 09:12.166
Here's your delicate package, my good sir.

09:12.250 --> 09:15.791
Where have you guys been?
You were gone for three days.

09:15.875 --> 09:19.791
Well, what do you expect?
You sent us to the top of Mount Eruptus.

09:19.875 --> 09:21.916
Not <i>the</i> Mount Eruptus.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.375
Mt. Eruptus Cleaners!

09:24.458 --> 09:26.833
"Mt. Eruptus Cleaners"?

09:27.416 --> 09:29.458
Oh!

09:29.541 --> 09:30.833
Oh, well.

09:30.916 --> 09:33.708
I guess there's only one thing
left to do, then.

09:33.791 --> 09:35.708
Time to break my high score!

09:36.583 --> 09:38.916
-Uh, Cuphead?
-What is it, Mugsy?

09:39.000 --> 09:40.333
I'm feeling a little…

09:40.416 --> 09:41.916
…dangerous.

09:46.791 --> 09:47.625
Nickel me.

09:49.541 --> 09:51.333
Oh, no, you don't!

09:52.875 --> 09:55.583
Here! Take it! And get out!

09:58.333 --> 10:00.000
Thank you, Porkrind!

10:00.083 --> 10:02.500
Fricking, fracking, lousy cups.

10:04.041 --> 10:07.250
Wait. If this ain't my laundry,
what the heck is it?

10:08.208 --> 10:09.625
An egg?

10:15.333 --> 10:16.583
Aw, cute.

10:18.333 --> 10:20.500
I know what I'm having for dinner.

10:23.375 --> 10:24.333
Uh-oh.

10:40.708 --> 10:42.916
I hate those cups.
