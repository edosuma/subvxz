WEBVTT

00:57.080 --> 00:59.040
-Hello!
-Greetings!

00:59.080 --> 01:01.520
Thank you so much. Thank you.

01:04.840 --> 01:06.600
JEREMY: Thanks, everybody.

01:06.640 --> 01:08.440
Good noises.

01:11.400 --> 01:14.320
JEREMY: Thank you.
Thank you, everyone.

01:15.480 --> 01:19.880
Welcome! And in
this incredible show...

01:19.920 --> 01:22.840
JEREMY:
Richard reads a map...

01:22.880 --> 01:25.520
James wears a hat...

01:25.560 --> 01:27.960
And I remember how old I am.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.800
I'm 57.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
-Brilliant stuff.

01:33.040 --> 01:35.280
A brilliant show.
A good one.

01:35.320 --> 01:38.480
Now, that smorgasbord

01:38.520 --> 01:41.280
of nail-biting action
is all to come,

01:41.320 --> 01:43.920
but we start with our feet
firmly on the ground.

01:43.960 --> 01:47.280
You see, us three agree on,
well, almost nothing, really,

01:47.320 --> 01:51.240
but we do agree that all
medium-sized SUVs

01:51.280 --> 01:54.000
are dreary and drab
and rubbish.

01:54.040 --> 01:56.720
Yes, but, and we were talking
about this the other day,

01:56.760 --> 01:58.720
they are incredibly popular.

01:58.760 --> 02:01.240
And we were arguing over
which ones we'd buy,

02:01.280 --> 02:03.920
if we absolutely had to.

02:03.960 --> 02:05.680
Yeah, and needless to say,
we couldn't agree.

02:05.720 --> 02:07.040
No, it got quite heated.

02:07.080 --> 02:08.360
It did get
very heated indeed.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.600
So we decided
we should settle it

02:10.640 --> 02:13.560
by taking The Grand Tour
this week to Canada.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.080
No, we didn't.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.040
JEREMY: This was
the meeting point we chose.

02:26.240 --> 02:28.520
The Area 27 race track.

02:30.480 --> 02:33.680
It was designed by F1 star
Jacques Villeneuve.

02:36.360 --> 02:38.440
And it's a bit of
a hidden gem.

02:43.600 --> 02:46.080
And I'd be driving
round it in this:

02:46.120 --> 02:48.600
the new Alfa Romeo Stelvio.

02:51.520 --> 02:54.960
There is no way in hell that
I would buy one of these

02:55.000 --> 02:57.400
because the saloon
on which it's based

02:57.440 --> 03:00.200
is faster, cheaper,
more economical

03:00.240 --> 03:01.600
and nicer to drive,

03:01.640 --> 03:04.720
but if I had to have
an SUV...

03:06.160 --> 03:08.200
This is what I'd choose.

03:08.240 --> 03:10.200
At this point, May arrived

03:10.240 --> 03:14.080
in the supercharged
V6 Range Rover Velar.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.040
Well, you've done that wrong.

03:20.080 --> 03:22.080
-No, I haven't.
-Mm.

03:22.120 --> 03:24.560
Look, in the first season
of The Grand Tour ,

03:24.600 --> 03:27.600
we did a big test of three
large off-roaders.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.320
You had a Range Rover
and you went:

03:29.360 --> 03:31.040
"You'd be mad not to have
a Range Rover,

03:31.080 --> 03:32.440
the Range Rover
is literally the best."

03:32.480 --> 03:34.240
So you can't then stand there
and say that it isn't.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.920
What I meant when
I said you'd got it wrong,
well, I meant two things.

03:36.960 --> 03:39.160
One: you've picked
the wrong one -
you should have had an Alfa,

03:39.200 --> 03:41.440
and two:
it's the wrong colour.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.160
I saw one of those
in London

03:43.200 --> 03:44.880
the other day
and it was silver,

03:44.920 --> 03:46.880
and it's one of the
best-looking cars
I've ever seen.

03:46.920 --> 03:48.440
It is a very good-looking
car, yes, I agree.

03:48.480 --> 03:50.120
Really good-looking.
That's just hideous.

03:50.160 --> 03:54.240
That looks like it's got a
glovebox full of K and MDF...

03:54.280 --> 03:55.560
What, building materials?

03:55.600 --> 03:58.080
No, not MDF. What do I mean?
What is it? I don't know.

03:58.120 --> 04:00.520
DIRECTOR: MDMA.
-MDMA. Director
knew that, weirdly.

04:00.560 --> 04:01.920
Anyway, never mind that.

04:01.960 --> 04:04.800
What that is is a Range Rover

04:04.840 --> 04:08.840
that sits between the Evoque
and the Range Rover Sport.

04:09.960 --> 04:12.000
I thought the Disco
sat there.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.600
No, that sits over
to one side.

04:13.640 --> 04:18.080
No, the Discovery Sport sits
between the Evoque and the...

04:18.120 --> 04:19.800
-No, wait.
-No, the Discovery Sport...

04:19.840 --> 04:22.200
-Hang on, you've got Evoque.
-Yes.

04:22.240 --> 04:24.320
Discovery Sport off
to one side.

04:24.360 --> 04:25.600
-No, it isn't.
-Yes, it is.

04:25.640 --> 04:28.560
-Because that's the serious
off-roady bit, not the...

04:28.600 --> 04:29.800
It's not serious!

04:29.840 --> 04:31.960
JEREMY: Before we had a
chance to get to the bottom

04:32.000 --> 04:34.480
of Land Rover's very
complicated line-up,

04:34.520 --> 04:37.280
Richard Hammond
arrived in a Porsche Macan.

04:37.320 --> 04:40.560
Wow, Hammond, that is modern.

04:40.600 --> 04:41.880
Yeah, that's where
you're wrong.

04:41.920 --> 04:43.160
He's making a habit of that.

04:43.200 --> 04:47.040
This is the new Porsche Macan
Turbo Performance Pack.

04:47.080 --> 04:49.520
You get 40 horsepower
more than the standard Turbo,

04:49.560 --> 04:52.040
so it makes 434 in total.

04:52.080 --> 04:55.160
-Yeah, in there, yes.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.000
And you managed
to make it move?

04:57.040 --> 04:59.960
-505!

05:00.000 --> 05:02.040
Italian horses.

05:02.080 --> 05:04.000
Which, let's face it,
a flock of Italian horses

05:04.040 --> 05:05.880
could go from
Shire to Shetland.

05:05.920 --> 05:08.480
-These are German horses--

05:08.520 --> 05:12.160
-442.
-443.

05:12.200 --> 05:13.560
Oh, right. One more.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.800
Well, it's too many
for a car on stilts.

05:15.840 --> 05:18.000
-This isn't!

05:18.040 --> 05:19.640
What do you mean?
Of course it's high!

05:19.680 --> 05:21.840
It looks like somebody's
startled it!

05:21.880 --> 05:23.200
It's an SUV!

05:24.480 --> 05:26.480
JEREMY: At this point,

05:26.520 --> 05:28.320
we decided to get on
with testing

05:28.360 --> 05:32.840
the "S" part of our SUVs,
the sporty bit.

05:38.240 --> 05:42.000
We began by sending
a BMW M3 sport saloon

05:42.040 --> 05:45.400
round the track to get
a benchmark time.

05:48.320 --> 05:50.360
It's a really,
really good race track.

05:52.640 --> 05:55.480
"Good race track"
is like saying "fun fair",

05:55.520 --> 05:57.680
it's just a contradiction.

05:57.720 --> 06:00.440
James, I think most
of our viewers would
disagree with you on that.

06:00.480 --> 06:02.720
I dunno.

06:02.760 --> 06:04.280
-Here it comes.
-Here it is, and...

06:08.120 --> 06:09.880
Two minutes 26 seconds,

06:09.920 --> 06:12.600
and James May will
now fail to match that

06:12.640 --> 06:15.560
in his Range Rover Velar.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.000
JEREMY: James was
soon ready to go,

06:23.120 --> 06:25.240
but there was a problem.

06:25.280 --> 06:28.640
Can you hear me in the BMW?

06:28.680 --> 06:31.480
Could we have the brown
BMW get off the track?

06:31.520 --> 06:33.840
DIRECTOR: Saying
the key isn't in the car.

06:33.880 --> 06:35.720
-I don't know.

06:35.760 --> 06:37.800
Because if it was keyless,
if somebody got out

06:37.840 --> 06:39.440
with the key
and it was running--

06:39.480 --> 06:41.680
-No, no, cos they stop.
-No, they don't.

06:41.720 --> 06:42.880
What?

06:42.920 --> 06:45.000
Course they don't,
cos otherwise it'd
just stop on the motorway.

06:45.040 --> 06:46.280
What they won't
do is restart.

06:46.320 --> 06:49.440
All the while this is going on,
I'm forgetting the track.

06:49.480 --> 06:51.240
You go down here
and you go left,

06:51.280 --> 06:53.760
and then it's a fog.

06:53.800 --> 06:55.280
Who has the key?

06:55.320 --> 06:58.280
Come on, one of you
has been near the BMW.

06:58.320 --> 07:00.840
Where's the key? Have you
checked your pockets?

07:02.040 --> 07:04.080
With the key nowhere
to be found,

07:04.120 --> 07:06.520
there was only one solution.

07:06.560 --> 07:10.120
Ditch the health and safety
and get on with it anyway.

07:16.080 --> 07:17.480
And he's off!

07:21.680 --> 07:23.960
Right, compared
with Pinky and Perky

07:24.000 --> 07:26.520
I have the least power,
the least torque,

07:26.560 --> 07:30.800
I have the least impressive
0-60 time and top speed,

07:30.840 --> 07:34.200
but I do have the mostest
number of gears at eight,

07:34.240 --> 07:37.760
so that's nice and confusing.

07:37.800 --> 07:40.760
What happens here? No idea.

07:40.800 --> 07:45.560
You know, one of
the reasons why that thing
is gonna be very slow

07:45.600 --> 07:47.360
is because of
who's driving it.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.960
Yeah, it's cause and effect.

07:50.840 --> 07:54.120
Now in bigger Range Rovers
the power is split 50-50

07:54.160 --> 07:55.400
between the front
and rear wheels.

07:55.440 --> 07:57.920
On this one, it's biased
more towards the back

07:57.960 --> 07:59.920
which is, of course,
very sporty.

07:59.960 --> 08:02.280
But it will put some
to the front

08:02.320 --> 08:04.640
when you're off-road,
and you need traction, or...

08:04.680 --> 08:06.680
Oh, God.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.200
When I cock it up.

08:09.240 --> 08:11.080
JEREMY: Do you know
what he did last weekend?

08:11.120 --> 08:15.520
He took his girlfriend across
London to the Victoria
and Albert Museum

08:15.560 --> 08:17.760
to look at
an exhibition of plywood.

08:21.920 --> 08:24.440
How good was that?

08:24.480 --> 08:26.760
JEREMY: Next up,
Richard "Lucky" Hammond.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.760
His wife's already telephoned
him this morning,

08:29.800 --> 08:33.080
said if he goes round the
corner with any tyre squeal,
she's divorcing him.

08:34.720 --> 08:36.480
Three, two, one. Go!

08:37.560 --> 08:38.920
RICHARD: And we're away.

08:38.960 --> 08:40.920
Whoa!

08:42.560 --> 08:44.960
Minding the BMW on arriving
at this first turn.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.880
No tyre squeal.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.440
This is the only
one of the three

08:50.480 --> 08:53.600
that has a proper
dual-clutch gearbox.

08:53.640 --> 08:56.160
the other two are just
old-school slushmatics.

08:56.200 --> 09:00.240
So it does change
like a race car.

09:00.280 --> 09:01.480
Ooh, did you hear that?

09:01.520 --> 09:03.240
- Nice little sporty noise.
- JEREMY: Yeah.

09:04.720 --> 09:07.440
There is no doubt this thing
can talk the talk.

09:07.480 --> 09:10.880
It's got dry sump,
active aero,

09:10.920 --> 09:13.240
but it's all wrapped up
in the wrong body.

09:15.840 --> 09:17.560
Huge amount of lean,
I mean...

09:19.600 --> 09:20.840
Scrabbling for grip.

09:20.880 --> 09:24.920
Those squeals from the tyres
are in protest, not for joy.

09:26.400 --> 09:31.640
Hammond breaking
his record, completing
a lap without a crash.

09:31.680 --> 09:35.600
JEREMY: Finally, it was
the turn of the Stelvio.

09:35.640 --> 09:38.840
Three, two, one. Go!

09:40.400 --> 09:42.760
Oh, well, that's
just a flying start.

09:46.200 --> 09:47.960
And he's hit the BMW.

09:50.640 --> 09:53.880
The twin turbo-charged
V6 engine in this thing...

09:55.240 --> 09:57.920
Well, it's a masterpiece,
there's no other word.

10:01.120 --> 10:04.000
The body's made
from aluminium.

10:04.040 --> 10:06.800
The prop shaft is made
from carbon fibre.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.960
This has all the ingredients
of a full-on racer.

10:12.800 --> 10:15.760
And it is quick. Easily
the quickest car here.

10:15.800 --> 10:18.160
0-60, 3.9 seconds.

10:18.200 --> 10:21.680
Top speed, 177.

10:21.720 --> 10:23.080
In an SUV!

10:24.760 --> 10:28.440
In a straight line, it would
leave even the M3 for dead.

10:28.480 --> 10:30.760
But this circuit
isn't a straight line.

10:30.800 --> 10:33.600
Which causes a few problems.

10:33.640 --> 10:36.800
Oh, chief among which
is the steering.

10:36.840 --> 10:39.960
It's as fast as the steering
you get in the saloon car

10:40.000 --> 10:43.120
and it is too quick
in a car of this type.

10:45.880 --> 10:48.600
It...  hell!

10:48.640 --> 10:50.720
See what I mean?

10:50.760 --> 10:53.720
Tiniest little movement of
the wheel and it's darting
all over the place.

10:53.760 --> 10:57.960
Couple that to the wobbly
long travel suspension

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
and it all gets
a bit haywire.

11:02.520 --> 11:03.640
Whoa!

11:03.680 --> 11:06.680
-That was rubbish!

11:07.960 --> 11:09.640
And across the line.

11:11.320 --> 11:13.920
JEREMY: After that fast
but messy lap,

11:13.960 --> 11:16.320
it was time to review
the times.

11:16.360 --> 11:19.480
BMW, two minutes 26.

11:19.520 --> 11:23.240
Range Rover,
three minutes two.

11:23.280 --> 11:29.240
Porsche, 2.46, you're
only 20 seconds slower
than the M3.

11:29.280 --> 11:33.120
Alfa Romeo, 2.40.

11:33.160 --> 11:36.920
Six seconds faster
than the Porsche Turbo

11:36.960 --> 11:39.680
which proves, conclusively,

11:39.720 --> 11:44.280
that the most sporty of three
completely un-sporty vehicles

11:44.320 --> 11:46.120
is the Alfa Romeo.

11:46.160 --> 11:48.240
-Yes.
-Right.

11:48.280 --> 11:51.960
Onwards, to the next
part of our test.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.840
JEREMY: Which was to find out
how utilitarian they are.

11:58.160 --> 12:01.000
We're gonna do this
by seeing which one of us

12:01.040 --> 12:05.080
can get the most
amount of dogs in
the boot of our car.

12:06.240 --> 12:09.000
Hammond, you idiot.

12:09.040 --> 12:10.160
What are they?

12:10.200 --> 12:12.400
If you say "dog" in Canada,
these are what you get.

12:12.440 --> 12:15.000
-Newfoundlands!
-Hammond, they're enormous.

12:15.040 --> 12:17.440
JAMES: They're not dogs,
they're cattle.

12:17.480 --> 12:19.240
Yep...

12:19.280 --> 12:20.720
JAMES: Oh, they're
having sex behind you.

12:20.760 --> 12:24.360
Oh, there's dog sex. There's
actual dog sex going on.

12:24.400 --> 12:27.160
-Dog sex. We don't
need to see this.
-Maybe we should...

12:27.200 --> 12:31.520
In a brief break from
the mating, we got on
with the test.

12:32.840 --> 12:35.760
Up you go! Come on!
Come on!

12:35.800 --> 12:39.560
Up! In the car! Come on,
it's a new Range Rover!
Come on, dog!

12:39.600 --> 12:44.000
Right. Erm, there's...
No. No.

12:44.040 --> 12:48.240
I've got...
Up we go. In we go.

12:48.280 --> 12:51.960
JAMES: The dog has
never been in a car and
doesn't want to go in one.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.640
Right. Sit.

12:54.680 --> 12:56.440
Getting another dog.

13:02.640 --> 13:04.320
Dog beer.

13:08.320 --> 13:09.560
Ow.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.440
Yes! Stay.

13:13.720 --> 13:19.080
Ahem! The Alfa Romeo,
not only the sportiest
vehicle,

13:19.120 --> 13:22.280
but, as you can see,
perfectly capable

13:22.320 --> 13:25.560
of handling a brace of dogs.

13:29.760 --> 13:31.040
Oh.

13:32.320 --> 13:35.440
Yeah, the problem is,
you know electric
tailgates...

13:35.480 --> 13:37.080
If they sense anything,
they'll open.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.360
-Yes, that's what's...

13:38.400 --> 13:42.280
-So you can't
actually close...

13:42.320 --> 13:45.400
Oh! Biggest dog here is in.

13:45.440 --> 13:48.440
Yeah, but you try closing,
OK, close your boot, then.

13:48.480 --> 13:50.400
Go on, then.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.280
You see, it won't close
cos it's electric.

13:55.440 --> 13:57.520
All we've established,
then, so far

13:57.560 --> 13:59.960
is that these cars are
nowhere near as fast

14:00.000 --> 14:02.320
as an ordinary car
around a race track.

14:02.360 --> 14:05.080
That you cannot put
a medium-sized dog in them

14:05.120 --> 14:08.080
because of
the electric tailgate

14:08.120 --> 14:10.680
and you'll damage
them cos they've all
got painted rear ends

14:10.720 --> 14:11.960
and carpeted boot floors.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.920
And that concludes another
important test. I'm sorry!

14:19.200 --> 14:20.920
JEREMY: We then
went for a short drive

14:20.960 --> 14:23.400
to the location
for our third test.

14:24.680 --> 14:29.280
How well our cars
worked as vehicles.

14:30.560 --> 14:32.240
Now to do this,
we are going to see

14:32.280 --> 14:35.480
whether our cars
are better than a horse.

14:35.520 --> 14:37.360
And here comes the horse now.

14:39.640 --> 14:42.440
It's being ridden by someone
called Meinie Kampf.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.640
-It's Maddie.

14:44.680 --> 14:46.080
It's Maddie.

14:46.120 --> 14:48.280
Yes, Maddie,
Meinie's something
completely different.

14:48.320 --> 14:52.240
Do you know, my Range Rover
is better than that horse
in every single way.

14:52.280 --> 14:53.640
-Yes, it is.

14:53.680 --> 14:54.960
-Well, yes it is,

14:55.000 --> 14:57.840
because it doesn't
jig around a bit when
you're trying to get in it.

14:57.880 --> 15:00.200
It doesn't set off on its own
at maximum speed.

15:00.240 --> 15:02.600
It doesn't veer off to one
side to eat something

15:02.640 --> 15:04.400
or sniff another
Range Rover's arse.

15:04.440 --> 15:07.600
Yes, good.
Thing is, though, we're
trying to find out now

15:07.640 --> 15:11.280
whether our cars
are faster than
this horse in this arena.

15:18.400 --> 15:21.560
This is barrel racing.

15:21.600 --> 15:24.120
A sport for cowboy girls,

15:24.160 --> 15:28.720
the idea is that you
ride round three barrels
as fast as possible...

15:32.240 --> 15:34.920
..while wearing
Wrangler jeans.

15:36.760 --> 15:41.280
Her time was 22.69 seconds.
That's what she did it in.

15:41.320 --> 15:43.240
I shall now go and
beat it in my Porsche.

15:43.280 --> 15:46.840
Well, this is what roads look
like where Hammond lives.

15:46.880 --> 15:49.800
All of this is
like his garden.

15:49.840 --> 15:52.600
Broken tractor,
knackered old caravan...

15:52.640 --> 15:53.960
JAMES: Rusty fence...

15:54.000 --> 15:56.920
It's as if we've come
to Hammond's house.

15:56.960 --> 16:00.040
RICHARD: Soon,
I was in position and
preparing for the off.

16:00.080 --> 16:03.160
Right, to do this
I need Sport Plus...

16:03.200 --> 16:05.120
Firm suspension...

16:05.160 --> 16:06.520
No ride height...

16:06.560 --> 16:08.000
Traction control off...

16:08.040 --> 16:14.560
OK, in three, two, one... Go!

16:14.600 --> 16:16.280
And we're off!

16:16.320 --> 16:20.200
Barrel racing, so, I've gotta
get round this one first
of all, on my right.

16:23.160 --> 16:25.680
I'm already going
much faster than the horse.

16:25.720 --> 16:26.960
Left now.

16:29.480 --> 16:30.840
What?

16:33.160 --> 16:36.400
-He's stuck.

16:36.440 --> 16:38.320
A four-wheel drive overload!

16:39.600 --> 16:41.120
What?

16:42.520 --> 16:44.400
Oh, it's gone into
limp home mode!

16:46.920 --> 16:49.720
JEREMY: This is the most
lamentable spectacle!

16:49.760 --> 16:51.480
HAMMOND: Can I do it again?

16:51.520 --> 16:52.920
No,
don't let him do it again.

16:52.960 --> 16:54.520
JEREMY: No,
you can't have another go.

16:54.560 --> 16:57.480
That was your time,
and it was 48.7 seconds,

16:57.520 --> 17:02.160
which means that car,
it's not even half
as good as a horse.

17:02.200 --> 17:05.400
Next, it was May's
turn in the Velar.

17:06.920 --> 17:08.600
Three, two, one, go!

17:18.520 --> 17:21.920
He's not lost.
Actually, I really did
think he'd be lost.

17:21.960 --> 17:24.280
-Oh, God, he's gonna beat me.
-Come on.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.280
HAMMOND: Oh, no! Look,
he can't find the fence.

17:29.320 --> 17:32.120
What is he...
He can't find the fence!

17:32.160 --> 17:33.640
What the hell is this?

17:33.680 --> 17:34.840
Come on.

17:37.320 --> 17:40.520
What's the time?
Please tell me he's
quicker than you.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.160
40.78.

17:43.920 --> 17:46.000
-Would you like to jump off
the back here?
-Yes.

17:47.760 --> 17:49.640
JEREMY: Finally,
it was my turn,

17:49.680 --> 17:51.960
and I'd had a brilliant idea.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.440
This is what
those two didn't realise.

17:55.480 --> 17:59.960
Use the handbrake,
fight the turnaround
on the up.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.040
In three, two, one, go.

18:06.160 --> 18:07.680
There it is!

18:07.720 --> 18:09.520
Ready for the handbrake?

18:09.560 --> 18:11.360
Here it comes!

18:12.400 --> 18:13.600
Oh.

18:13.640 --> 18:16.120
He's gone to put
the handbrake on,

18:16.160 --> 18:19.120
but it's an electronic
handbrake so it
just stops dead.

18:19.160 --> 18:22.680
The electric handbrake
is as useless as
the electric tailgate!

18:27.320 --> 18:28.680
Oh, no!

18:28.720 --> 18:31.440
No, I'm in limp home!

18:31.480 --> 18:35.120
Service ATV system,
everything has failed!

18:36.240 --> 18:37.920
Virtually parked.

18:37.960 --> 18:40.160
This is it flat out.

18:40.200 --> 18:43.040
Foot hard down,
barely moving.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.440
That looks utterly feeble.

18:45.480 --> 18:47.680
He's still not out.
And... He's out.

18:47.720 --> 18:48.880
Damn you!

18:52.280 --> 18:54.320
-You did it...

18:54.360 --> 18:55.640
-Yes.
-...in...

18:55.680 --> 18:57.080
Yes.

18:57.120 --> 18:59.640
...45.44!

18:59.680 --> 19:02.320
-So James May
was the fastest?
-Yes.

19:02.360 --> 19:05.680
-And then I was
the second fastest?
-Yes.

19:05.720 --> 19:08.520
And, with that
test completed,

19:08.560 --> 19:11.040
it was time
for our conclusion.

19:11.080 --> 19:14.240
We've proved that
SUVs are no good

19:14.280 --> 19:17.520
at sport or utility stuff.

19:17.560 --> 19:19.200
And that if you
want a vehicle,

19:19.240 --> 19:21.160
you're better off
with a horse.

19:21.200 --> 19:23.320
And with that,
back to the tent.

19:27.120 --> 19:29.440
-Hang on.
-It was important work.

19:31.040 --> 19:35.120
Thing is, we thought that
we'd finished at that point,

19:35.160 --> 19:38.000
but Mr Willman
had other ideas,

19:38.040 --> 19:40.400
so we're gonna be
picking that up later on.

19:40.440 --> 19:41.640
Yes, we shall.

19:41.680 --> 19:46.520
However, now it's time to
step in a dog turd of chat

19:46.560 --> 19:48.800
on Conversation Street.

19:48.840 --> 19:51.680
Ow. Aargh. Ow.

19:51.720 --> 19:54.440
JAMES: Ooh. Ow. Ow. Ooh.

19:54.480 --> 19:56.040
-It was a good day, that.

19:57.600 --> 20:01.640
Now, I wanna stick, if I may,
for a minute or two, on SUVs

20:01.680 --> 20:04.680
because 25 percent
of all new cars

20:04.720 --> 20:06.800
sold in Britain
these days are SUVs.

20:06.840 --> 20:08.960
And the thing is, I was
working out the other day

20:09.000 --> 20:10.440
why so many people buy them.

20:10.480 --> 20:11.800
And I've worked it out.

20:11.840 --> 20:13.760
See, if you were in
a hatchback or a saloon

20:13.800 --> 20:16.080
and you see an SUV -
which is larger -
coming towards you,

20:16.120 --> 20:17.800
you think, "If we
have an accident,

20:17.840 --> 20:19.040
"I'm gonna come off worse.

20:19.080 --> 20:20.880
"So I'd better
have one, too."

20:20.920 --> 20:22.200
They're like nuclear weapons.

20:22.240 --> 20:24.880
Once one person's got one,
everyone's gotta have one.

20:24.920 --> 20:28.680
Next thing you know,
Kim Jong-Un's got one,
and then it's all a disaster.

20:28.720 --> 20:31.080
But the fact remains,
everybody has them or not,

20:31.120 --> 20:32.280
they are really silly.

20:32.320 --> 20:34.480
The moment we asked
that Alfa and that Porsche

20:34.520 --> 20:35.960
to do a tiny bit of
off-roading

20:36.000 --> 20:37.240
in that horse arena,

20:37.280 --> 20:39.800
they just panicked
and gave up and went
into limp home mode.

20:39.840 --> 20:42.960
I actually think they
might have too much
electronic stuff on them.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.560
They do. The four-wheel-drive
system's all idiotic,

20:45.600 --> 20:48.320
and then the handbrake,
that doesn't work,
and the tailgate.

20:48.360 --> 20:52.000
I mean, how do you actually
load a dog into a car?

20:52.040 --> 20:53.640
I dunno. I mean, you can't...

20:53.680 --> 20:55.840
If you put your hand in
to hold the dog back,

20:55.880 --> 20:58.280
then it's gonna
detect your arm.

20:58.320 --> 21:00.920
You'd have to go
round and hold
the dog against the seat.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.320
But then you can't
close the boot.

21:02.360 --> 21:04.600
I know. And also,
while you're walking round,

21:04.640 --> 21:07.560
the dog's left on its own in
a boot with an open tailgate.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.400
What you're doing is
asking a dog to stay alone

21:10.440 --> 21:13.240
in a room
that's getting smaller.

21:13.280 --> 21:14.880
It's not gonna do it,
it's gonna run away.

21:14.920 --> 21:16.960
There is no solution to this
that I can think of.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.640
There is a way to do it.

21:18.680 --> 21:20.760
You'd have to put
your dog in the boot,

21:20.800 --> 21:22.360
shoot it with
a tranquiliser dart,

21:22.400 --> 21:23.880
so that it went out
for a bit.

21:23.920 --> 21:26.400
Well, yes, James,
you could do that

21:26.440 --> 21:28.840
or you could buy a car with
a manually closing boot lid.

21:28.880 --> 21:32.280
Yeah, which would be cheaper,
lighter, faster and easier.

21:32.320 --> 21:36.200
So, that's covered that.
Don't buy SUVs,
they're stupid.

21:36.240 --> 21:38.240
But we have got
more on them later on.

21:38.280 --> 21:40.000
I've got a bit
of conversation.

21:40.040 --> 21:41.680
-Is it about iambic
pentameters?
-No.

21:41.720 --> 21:44.400
-No.

21:44.440 --> 21:46.120
-No.

21:46.160 --> 21:48.160
-It's about vans.

21:48.200 --> 21:49.760
-Yes.

21:49.800 --> 21:51.840
Because I borrowed
a transit van the other day

21:51.880 --> 21:53.320
and the amazing
thing about it is,

21:53.360 --> 21:55.840
it's got all the equipment
you'd expect on a posh car,

21:55.880 --> 21:59.240
including those
sensing headlights
that dip automatically.

21:59.280 --> 22:01.600
So when they see lights
coming the other way,
they automatically dip,

22:01.640 --> 22:04.800
but they also dip if they
see a reflective road sign.

22:04.840 --> 22:06.360
Oh, I know,
that's unbelievable,

22:06.400 --> 22:07.800
cos it blinds you,
cos they've dipped.

22:07.840 --> 22:09.360
And now you can't
see where you're going,

22:09.400 --> 22:12.400
as you approach
a sign warning you
of a hazard ahead

22:12.440 --> 22:14.360
which you then can't see.
No, they are stupid.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.360
Here comes a really
dangerous right-hand bend.

22:16.400 --> 22:19.280
-I'll just turn the lights
off so you can't see it.
-They do do that.

22:19.320 --> 22:21.320
But apart from that,
I have to say,

22:21.360 --> 22:22.960
the Ford Transit van
long wheel-base,

22:23.000 --> 22:24.320
is absolutely brilliant.

22:24.360 --> 22:27.280
Much better than any SUV
and half the price.

22:27.320 --> 22:31.600
And the amazing thing is,
you can get absolutely
tonnes in the back of it.

22:31.640 --> 22:35.880
Well, yeah, James.
It's a van. It's kinda
what it's for.

22:35.920 --> 22:37.960
The one problem
with it was, I found,

22:38.000 --> 22:40.400
is that when you load a van,
you have to get out.

22:40.440 --> 22:42.720
You don't step out,
you sort of do
a little jump...

22:42.760 --> 22:44.720
No, I don't do
a little jump. I just...

22:44.760 --> 22:46.880
You do a little jump,
but what I didn't think of

22:46.920 --> 22:49.040
was that I had
my big parka on,

22:49.080 --> 22:51.400
and as I jumped out,
the hood caught on the roof

22:51.440 --> 22:54.760
and I actually hanged
myself pretty much as I...

22:54.800 --> 22:56.280
If you actually
had hung yourself,

22:56.320 --> 22:57.760
we'd have put out
a press release

22:57.800 --> 22:59.800
saying that you'd died
in an autoerotic accident.

22:59.840 --> 23:01.160
-Yeah, we would.
-Thank you.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.560
-Did you have an orange
in your mouth?
-No, I didn't.

23:03.600 --> 23:05.880
You would have done
in our version of events.

23:05.920 --> 23:08.560
You'd have been
wearing a fur-lined
anorak and nothing else.

23:08.600 --> 23:10.920
When you were
found by police.

23:12.560 --> 23:15.440
Bet you wish
you hadn't started
that conversation now.

23:15.480 --> 23:17.720
Now, we get quite
a few letters asking us

23:17.760 --> 23:20.640
why we never review
anything made by Tesla.

23:20.680 --> 23:22.280
Mm, very simple, actually.

23:22.320 --> 23:26.400
Many years ago, I gave
a firm but fair review

23:26.440 --> 23:28.800
to the Roadster -
picture of that one there.

23:28.840 --> 23:31.120
-Yep, and Tesla sued.
-Yes, they did.

23:31.160 --> 23:34.160
And they lost. And then they
appealed and they lost that.

23:34.200 --> 23:37.840
Which is all fine,
but being sued is
a massive pain in the arse.

23:37.880 --> 23:39.800
It keeps you awake
at night, really stressy.

23:39.840 --> 23:43.840
So I thought I will never,
ever review another
Tesla as long as I live,

23:43.880 --> 23:45.400
I shall simply ignore them.

23:45.440 --> 23:50.080
However, Tesla is
on the brink of becoming
a mainstream manufacturer.

23:50.120 --> 23:52.000
They reckon that
by the end of this year,

23:52.040 --> 23:54.400
they'll be bigger than Volvo.

23:54.440 --> 23:56.280
Mm. So I couldn't really
ignore them any more.

23:56.320 --> 23:59.640
Which is why I decided to
test the new Model X, OK?

23:59.680 --> 24:04.480
Because I thought
this might actually be
an SUV we all like.

24:08.400 --> 24:10.560
JEREMY: With its
bobby-dazzler back doors,

24:10.600 --> 24:13.280
this doesn't look like
a normal family SUV,

24:14.640 --> 24:15.960
it looks better.

24:17.800 --> 24:21.200
Especially on the inside.

24:21.240 --> 24:23.840
And it's more practical, too.

24:25.200 --> 24:29.080
Because you have
seating for seven,

24:29.120 --> 24:33.160
a boot at the back that's big
enough for an owl sanctuary,

24:33.200 --> 24:36.800
and then another boot
at the front,

24:36.840 --> 24:40.280
because, of course,
it's electric
so there's no engine.

24:41.720 --> 24:45.320
Most of all, though,
I'm intrigued by this car

24:45.360 --> 24:48.680
because it represents a whole
new way of thinking about...

24:50.480 --> 24:51.920
What a car actually is.

24:53.640 --> 24:58.800
Take this enormous
command and control
screen as an example.

24:58.840 --> 25:00.240
It does all the usual stuff:

25:00.280 --> 25:02.400
navigation, music,
connectivity and so on,

25:02.440 --> 25:04.560
and so much more besides.

25:04.600 --> 25:08.680
For example, if I want, I can
turn it into a sketchpad.

25:08.720 --> 25:11.360
Then I can just draw
pretty patterns

25:11.400 --> 25:13.840
and so on as I go along.

25:13.880 --> 25:18.040
Or, if I'm bored with being
in  -

25:18.080 --> 25:19.960
there you are,
Swindon, which I am,

25:20.000 --> 25:23.440
I can change it
so that I become...

25:23.480 --> 25:27.960
On Mars! Look at that,
I'm actually on Mars.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.280
I mean, I'm not there,
obviously,

25:30.320 --> 25:32.600
but it says I am
and that's fun!

25:32.640 --> 25:34.360
Ooh, and this is a good one.

25:34.400 --> 25:38.440
If you don't want to see
the car you're driving
depicted on the screen,

25:38.480 --> 25:41.480
you can change it
so that it becomes...

25:43.160 --> 25:45.480
Bond's Lotus.

25:46.600 --> 25:48.480
That is actually quite funny.

25:51.200 --> 25:53.200
Of course,
you may think all of this

25:53.240 --> 25:57.920
might be a bit of
a distraction when
you're driving.

25:57.960 --> 26:00.200
Ah, well, now, you see,
that's the thing.

26:00.240 --> 26:03.160
Because if I pull
this lever here twice...

26:04.360 --> 26:07.320
I get a bong to tell me
I've engaged the autopilot,

26:07.360 --> 26:09.600
which means I'm not driving.

26:09.640 --> 26:11.800
It is.

26:11.840 --> 26:13.720
Seriously,
it's doing it all by itself.

26:16.280 --> 26:20.800
Legally, cars aren't allowed
to drive around by themselves

26:20.840 --> 26:22.280
but this is getting
awfully close

26:22.320 --> 26:24.600
because it's reading
the white lines in the road

26:24.640 --> 26:26.920
and then simply
sticking between them.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.320
Then if I want to
change lanes,

26:29.360 --> 26:32.320
I don't have to bother
with any of that mirror,
signal, manoeuvre nonsense,

26:32.360 --> 26:34.400
you just put
the indicator on...

26:34.440 --> 26:36.200
And if it's safe
to pull out, it does.

26:38.120 --> 26:42.280
Put the indicator on
to pull back into
the central lane and...

26:43.920 --> 26:47.680
That's just astonishing!

26:49.040 --> 26:51.280
All of this means
that I can drive along

26:51.320 --> 26:55.120
writing important messages
on my sketchpad.

26:55.160 --> 26:59.280
Because I know that if
the car in front slows down,
I'll slow down.

26:59.320 --> 27:00.800
If it speeds up,
I'll speed up.

27:00.840 --> 27:02.560
If the traffic stops,
I'll stop.

27:02.600 --> 27:04.600
Honestly, this is...

27:04.640 --> 27:07.560
the most relaxing thing
I've ever driven.

27:07.600 --> 27:11.840
Cos all I have to do
is sit here.

27:11.880 --> 27:15.240
Unless, of course, I can't
be bothered to do even that.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.480
OK, the car is over there

27:19.520 --> 27:23.200
and I literally can't be
arsed to walk to it.

27:23.240 --> 27:26.720
So, take out my phone,
put it in summon mode,

27:26.760 --> 27:28.560
connecting to vehicle and...

27:28.600 --> 27:29.840
Here we go.

27:39.880 --> 27:42.520
Look at that!

27:42.560 --> 27:45.320
I mean, it can't extricate
itself from a parking space

27:45.360 --> 27:47.880
or come to you from
the other side of town,

27:47.920 --> 27:50.520
so it is only a gimmick.

27:50.560 --> 27:52.520
But what's wrong
with a gimmick?

27:52.560 --> 27:53.720
That's brilliant!

27:53.760 --> 27:55.960
And... Stop!

28:01.200 --> 28:05.960
But what's it like if
you do actually drive it?

28:11.040 --> 28:15.760
Well, because it's electric,
it's quiet, obviously.

28:15.800 --> 28:17.920
Eerily quiet.

28:17.960 --> 28:22.560
Stupidly quiet. Too quiet,
as they say in the movies.

28:24.640 --> 28:29.200
It's also heavy because
of its massive battery pack.

28:29.240 --> 28:32.760
However, because
it's mounted under the floor,

28:32.800 --> 28:35.280
the centre of gravity
is very low down.

28:37.600 --> 28:40.880
And because you've got one
electric motor at the front
running the front wheels

28:40.920 --> 28:42.880
and one at the back
driving the back wheels...

28:48.080 --> 28:51.120
..the car feels
nimble and agile.

28:52.360 --> 28:53.640
Feels good.

28:56.520 --> 28:59.600
So, you're thinking it's
a fun-filled family car

28:59.640 --> 29:04.200
with show-off doors
and lots of stuff
to excite your inner child,

29:04.240 --> 29:08.760
but that there's
nothing here for
the enthusiastic motorist.

29:08.800 --> 29:10.000
Hm...

29:10.040 --> 29:11.920
Not so fast
on that one...

29:11.960 --> 29:14.680
Because what I'm gonna do now

29:14.720 --> 29:18.120
is drag race this family SUV

29:18.160 --> 29:22.360
against a mid-engine,
V10-powered

29:22.400 --> 29:26.440
600 horsepower Audi R8.

29:29.840 --> 29:31.240
Right, before I do this

29:31.280 --> 29:34.280
I'm going to engage what's
called "Ludicrous Mode".

29:35.600 --> 29:37.320
There we are.
Hold on, I've got a choice.

29:37.360 --> 29:40.040
"Do you wanna do this?"
"No, I want my Mommy."

29:40.080 --> 29:42.520
"Yes, bring it on!"
There we are.

29:42.560 --> 29:46.720
And then, because
I have the mental age
of a nine-year-old,

29:46.760 --> 29:50.440
I'm going to use
the warp speed graphic.

29:50.480 --> 29:51.880
And there it is!

29:51.920 --> 29:54.600
Right, good. I'm ready.

30:14.760 --> 30:17.440
Sweet Jesus!

30:18.960 --> 30:21.760
That really is
properly ludicrous!

30:24.480 --> 30:27.040
A hundred miles an hour!

30:27.080 --> 30:29.200
105, 110...

30:29.240 --> 30:30.920
112,
the Audi's coming!

30:32.360 --> 30:33.760
But not fast enough!

30:40.720 --> 30:42.920
That is astonishing!

30:44.240 --> 30:45.640
Small wonder
this thing is fitted

30:45.680 --> 30:49.840
with my favourite mode of
them all - celebration mode.

30:49.880 --> 30:52.680
There we are. All I have to
do now is put it in park,

30:52.720 --> 30:54.080
get out and lock the doors.

30:55.480 --> 30:57.160
Watch this.

30:57.200 --> 31:00.440
♪ MOZART:
Marriage Of Figaro Overture

31:24.280 --> 31:27.080
So, this may be
a two-and-a-half tonne,

31:27.120 --> 31:28.920
seven-seater PlayStation,

31:31.160 --> 31:34.240
but it'll do 0-60
in 3.1 seconds

31:34.280 --> 31:39.000
and has a top speed of 155.

31:39.040 --> 31:44.040
So it really does seem
to be all things to all men.

31:45.080 --> 31:47.640
It's serious
and light-hearted.

31:47.680 --> 31:49.880
It's sensible and daft.

31:51.560 --> 31:53.160
It doesn't feel
like anything else.

31:53.200 --> 31:54.960
It doesn't go
like anything else.

31:56.040 --> 31:57.240
It's fabulous.

32:01.560 --> 32:04.400
There are, however,
some drawbacks.

32:04.440 --> 32:06.280
But before talking
about those,

32:06.320 --> 32:09.240
Mr Willman said I should
fill the remaining six seats

32:09.280 --> 32:11.800
with a team of lawyers.

32:15.960 --> 32:17.520
First thing I wanna
talk about is range,

32:17.560 --> 32:21.720
because Tesla say this will
do 351 miles between charges.

32:21.760 --> 32:27.000
But, in my experience,
electric cars
never do the range...

32:27.040 --> 32:29.760
How extensive is
your experience, Jeremy?

32:29.800 --> 32:31.240
How many electric cars
have you driven?

32:31.280 --> 32:33.120
-Two.
-Ah.

32:33.160 --> 32:35.480
Both of them
failed to do the range

32:35.520 --> 32:37.120
that the manufacturer
said they would do.

32:37.160 --> 32:38.880
Cos it depends
on temperature,

32:38.920 --> 32:40.680
it depends on a million
things, and anyway--

32:40.720 --> 32:44.520
As you've said, legally
we need to make very clear,
it depends.

32:44.560 --> 32:46.160
It depends on the conditions.

32:46.200 --> 32:49.320
Most people are not driving
like a maniac like you.

32:49.360 --> 32:51.520
I'm not.
I'm doing 34 miles an hour.

32:51.560 --> 32:53.320
At the moment.

32:53.360 --> 32:55.480
So that we're clear,
we completely accept

32:55.520 --> 32:59.840
that this car
can do 351 miles
between charges, don't we?

32:59.880 --> 33:01.600
I don't know,
I haven't tried it.

33:01.640 --> 33:03.800
I think we should accept that
if that's what Tesla says

33:03.840 --> 33:05.760
and we don't have any
evidence to the contrary.

33:05.800 --> 33:08.720
What, you just take what
a car manufacturer
says as being gospel?

33:08.760 --> 33:10.640
Vauxhall says its cars
are exciting.

33:10.680 --> 33:13.280
I wouldn't wish to contradict
them on television

33:13.320 --> 33:15.400
unless we had strong
evidence to the contrary.

33:15.440 --> 33:17.440
Suggesting a claim by
the manufacturer is untrue

33:17.480 --> 33:19.520
is not where we're going
to go today, is it?

33:19.560 --> 33:21.720
All right, then. Batteries.

33:22.960 --> 33:25.680
We on this show
have some experience

33:25.720 --> 33:27.840
of electrical fires
in a crash.

33:27.880 --> 33:31.400
And this has the same sort of
batteries that the Rimac had.

33:31.440 --> 33:33.160
Yeah, that was in
a crash, wasn't it?

33:33.200 --> 33:36.640
Drove off an edge and
rolled down two hillsides.

33:36.680 --> 33:39.200
You're saying Richard Hammond
was too small to see over
the steering wheel?

33:39.240 --> 33:40.760
I'm not saying anything,

33:40.800 --> 33:42.320
I'm just saying that
that was a crash.

33:42.360 --> 33:44.040
What people don't understand

33:44.080 --> 33:46.440
is that if you crash
an electrical car,

33:46.480 --> 33:49.640
and it has
lithium-ion batteries,
it could catch fire.

33:49.680 --> 33:51.640
And often,
the fire brigade will turn up

33:51.680 --> 33:52.960
and they've only
got water on board,

33:53.000 --> 33:55.200
so as you're sitting there,
on fire,

33:55.240 --> 33:57.080
you're then
being electrocuted.

33:57.120 --> 33:59.640
It's just something
that's worth
bearing in mind, isn't it?

33:59.680 --> 34:01.360
I think we should
make it clear

34:01.400 --> 34:03.240
that we're not suggesting
that these cars

34:03.280 --> 34:04.680
have any inherent defect.

34:04.720 --> 34:07.320
I mean, look what
happened with Samsung
with their batteries.

34:07.360 --> 34:10.480
We're not gonna start
defaming Samsung, are we?

34:10.520 --> 34:13.400
I think the battery
is a good analogy

34:13.440 --> 34:15.640
for libel law
and reviews generally,

34:15.680 --> 34:17.880
in that it has
to be balanced.

34:17.920 --> 34:19.920
You must have
the positive and
you must have the negative.

34:19.960 --> 34:21.840
Shall we bear that in mind?

34:21.880 --> 34:24.760
What we should bear in mind
is that - what I've just
written on the screen.

34:26.600 --> 34:28.840
I know an area
we need to discuss.

34:28.880 --> 34:33.080
I think the biggest drawback
with this car, actually,
is the width of it.

34:33.120 --> 34:35.120
It's so wide, 79 inches,

34:35.160 --> 34:38.440
that it won't actually
go across Albert Bridge
in London.

34:38.480 --> 34:40.040
It really won't go
across the bridge

34:40.080 --> 34:43.120
or do you mean it won't go
through a width restriction,
a road narrowing?

34:43.160 --> 34:44.880
Right, so I have to say

34:44.920 --> 34:48.840
this is too wide
to fit through

34:48.880 --> 34:52.480
the width restriction
at the start,

34:52.520 --> 34:54.760
and indeed finish,
of Albert Bridge?

34:54.800 --> 34:56.040
That's perfect.

34:58.680 --> 35:01.120
There is, however,
one advantage to this size.

35:01.160 --> 35:04.520
Especially in
a supermarket car park

35:04.560 --> 35:07.040
when your Model X
is full of lawyers.

35:07.080 --> 35:08.960
- It can be interpreted--
-No, no. Listen.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.880
Mean what you say, say what
you mean, that's the law.

35:11.920 --> 35:13.960
Just stay there, all right?
Stay there.

35:15.400 --> 35:19.920
OK. Got the phone.
Summon mode, forwards.

35:27.520 --> 35:29.840
I'm sorry, that never
ceases to amaze me.

35:29.880 --> 35:32.840
Little bit more,
little bit more...

35:32.880 --> 35:34.760
And... Stop!

35:36.040 --> 35:38.240
Right, now they can't
open the doors -

35:38.280 --> 35:39.680
they're trapped -

35:39.720 --> 35:41.480
which means
they can't interfere

35:41.520 --> 35:44.960
when I tell you this car's
really big drawback.

35:45.000 --> 35:49.280
It's £156,000.

35:52.800 --> 35:55.760
JEREMY: There is...
a lot to like on that.

35:55.800 --> 35:58.400
-Yeah.
-There's a lot to like.

35:59.680 --> 36:01.960
Thing is, though,

36:02.000 --> 36:05.080
is that an SUV
that we all like?

36:05.120 --> 36:06.400
No. Not at that price.

36:06.440 --> 36:07.960
No, 156 is silly.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.400
I do love some
of the gimmicks.

36:09.440 --> 36:13.640
Yeah, now, on that, I have
to say, you know the summon
facility it's got on it?

36:13.680 --> 36:15.760
That didn't always work.

36:15.800 --> 36:17.600
And then there was
the business on the motorway

36:17.640 --> 36:20.000
where it checks
for traffic coming behind
before moving lanes.

36:20.040 --> 36:21.440
How'd you find that?

36:21.480 --> 36:23.840
Well, I can't say.

36:23.880 --> 36:26.160
So I got a lawyer
to write this for me.

36:30.160 --> 36:32.440
It's my honest belief
that a driverless system

36:32.480 --> 36:34.480
does not always
behave as you'd expect

36:34.520 --> 36:37.000
and when it doesn't,
it can be discomforting.

36:37.040 --> 36:38.160
Discomforting?

36:38.200 --> 36:40.840
However,
I acknowledge and accept

36:40.880 --> 36:43.880
that a number of external
factors can reasonably result

36:43.920 --> 36:46.840
in a driverless car's
decision to deactivate
self-driving,

36:46.880 --> 36:48.920
including,
but not limited to,

36:48.960 --> 36:52.280
other cars on the road
unexpectedly accelerating.

36:52.320 --> 36:53.680
-So...
-No.

36:53.720 --> 36:55.640
-No, just...

36:55.680 --> 36:57.560
For the avoidance
of any doubt,

36:57.600 --> 37:00.400
these personal observations
about driverless cars

37:00.440 --> 37:01.640
are my honest opinion

37:01.680 --> 37:03.400
and should not be
regarded as any statement

37:03.440 --> 37:06.760
about the general safety,
roadworthiness
or mechanical effectiveness

37:06.800 --> 37:09.640
of this specific car
or any other Tesla vehicle.

37:12.040 --> 37:13.520
It is bloody fast, though,
isn't it?

37:13.560 --> 37:14.800
-It really was!
-Really fast!

37:14.840 --> 37:16.520
We actually put it round
the Eboladrome.

37:16.560 --> 37:20.080
It did a 1.29.06,
which is the same
as a five-litre Mustang.

37:20.120 --> 37:21.880
-It is quick.

37:21.920 --> 37:23.480
But anyway, we must
park the Tesla now

37:23.520 --> 37:26.000
and move on to
Celebrity Face Off!

37:38.920 --> 37:43.400
Another important question,
and it's this.

37:43.440 --> 37:47.600
Who is the world's fastest
golfing enthusiast?

37:47.640 --> 37:50.360
Well, to find out,
would you please welcome

37:50.400 --> 37:53.120
Rory McIlroy
and Paris Hilton!

37:55.960 --> 37:57.960
JEREMY: Look at this!

37:58.960 --> 38:00.960
That is a surprise!

38:02.600 --> 38:04.600
Hello, chap, how are you?
Have a seat.

38:04.640 --> 38:06.480
Paris, lovely to see you,
how are you?

38:06.520 --> 38:08.720
-Great.
-Have a seat!

38:10.080 --> 38:12.240
We're not messing around.

38:12.280 --> 38:15.560
We are not
messing around this week.

38:15.600 --> 38:17.960
Now, you are both
golf enthusiasts.

38:18.000 --> 38:21.560
You obviously are, cos you're
heavyweight golfing champion
of the world.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.640
-Sorta need to be, yeah.

38:23.680 --> 38:25.520
You, more of a surprise,
but your family, of course,

38:25.560 --> 38:28.040
does own 50 golf tracks,
doesn't it?

38:28.080 --> 38:29.440
Yes.

38:29.480 --> 38:32.080
Or was it courses?
Courses, that's what it is.

38:32.120 --> 38:34.080
Fifty golf-- So you play
quite a bit of golf.

38:34.120 --> 38:37.320
I'm not as good a golfer
as him, obviously.

38:37.360 --> 38:38.920
As him? No, that figures.

38:38.960 --> 38:42.920
But I have been playing since
I was around four years old.

38:42.960 --> 38:46.240
The one area of golf
I really genuinely love
are the golf carts.

38:46.280 --> 38:47.920
Me too.

38:47.960 --> 38:51.840
I don't think I've ever
got out of a fully
functioning golf cart.

38:51.880 --> 38:53.120
In my life, ever.

38:53.160 --> 38:54.680
Cos I've always crashed them.

38:54.720 --> 38:56.160
I don't know what it is
that makes you think

38:56.200 --> 38:57.720
"Right, I'm going
to go a million."

38:57.760 --> 39:00.520
You would like my golf cart
because I've got
the restrictor taken off it

39:00.560 --> 39:02.160
so it goes about
50 miles an hour.

39:02.200 --> 39:03.680
-You're kidding.
-No, it does.

39:03.720 --> 39:06.360
-That's sick.
-How much damage
could I do with that?

39:06.400 --> 39:07.960
-You could do a lot.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.200
I love the golf carts.

39:09.240 --> 39:10.680
Actually,
when I was a little girl,

39:10.720 --> 39:12.280
my grandfather has

39:12.320 --> 39:14.760
a Rolls Royce golf cart
and a Bentley one.

39:14.800 --> 39:18.600
So my sister and I decided
that we wanted to race them.

39:18.640 --> 39:20.920
So we're going around
the pond on the golf course

39:20.960 --> 39:22.960
and going so fast,

39:23.000 --> 39:26.080
I smashed the Rolls
into this huge rock.

39:26.120 --> 39:29.200
The entire thing was smashed,
it was totalled.

39:29.240 --> 39:31.040
We were so scared,
we just ran away.

39:31.080 --> 39:32.960
And then later
my grandpa's like,

39:33.000 --> 39:35.240
"Where's the Rolls? I wanna
go golfing right now."

39:35.280 --> 39:38.880
Stolen. Stolen is the answer.
That's what I always say.

39:38.920 --> 39:41.680
Someone went
and had a joyride in it.

39:41.720 --> 39:44.480
I know one thing
I wanted to talk
about is golfing slang.

39:44.520 --> 39:46.280
-OK.
-Cos apparently

39:46.320 --> 39:48.760
there's quite a bit of,
well, it's quite rude.

39:48.800 --> 39:50.080
Are you familiar with this?

39:50.120 --> 39:52.240
There's a Richard Hammond,
I know that.

39:52.280 --> 39:53.640
There's a Richard Hammond,
which means

39:53.680 --> 39:55.160
straight down
the middle like a rocket,

39:55.200 --> 39:57.560
then veers off into
the rough at the last minute.

40:05.120 --> 40:08.800
Jamie Oliver, you really
wanna smack it but you can't.

40:10.640 --> 40:12.520
I actually like Jamie Oliver,
make that quite plain.

40:12.560 --> 40:14.080
This is not me, this is
just golfing people.

40:14.120 --> 40:18.360
Ryanair. OK in the air
but landed miles from
where you wanted it to be.

40:19.720 --> 40:21.400
Right, shall we
get on to cars?

40:21.440 --> 40:23.440
Cos this is another thing
you two have in common.

40:23.480 --> 40:27.240
Genuinely an astonishing
collection of cars
that you both have.

40:27.280 --> 40:30.200
You started, at the age
of 17, with a BMW.

40:30.240 --> 40:32.160
Yeah, I had a 1 Series
was my first car.

40:32.200 --> 40:34.240
-Not very well, no.

40:34.280 --> 40:37.600
I thought I was cool
having a BMW at that age,

40:37.640 --> 40:39.880
just passed my test.

40:39.920 --> 40:42.760
Tried to do some
handbrake turns in
the golf club car park

40:42.800 --> 40:44.120
and that didn't go so well.

40:44.160 --> 40:46.960
Nearly actually drove it
through the front door
of the golf club.

40:47.000 --> 40:50.320
Hit a big, high kerb,
bent the steering axle

40:50.360 --> 40:52.080
and I literally had
to drive it like this

40:52.120 --> 40:54.240
to keep it straight for
the five miles I went home.

40:54.280 --> 40:55.760
And I got back to my parents

40:55.800 --> 40:58.600
and I said I had to swerve
to miss a fox and hit a kerb.

40:58.640 --> 41:02.360
But, any girls watching,
they will have
been impressed.

41:02.400 --> 41:03.680
We've argued this many times.

41:03.720 --> 41:05.720
When a girl sees a guy
do a handbrake turn,

41:05.760 --> 41:07.440
it's like when a peacock
does that feather thing.

41:08.640 --> 41:10.120
You say
you're not interested,

41:10.160 --> 41:11.480
but you are, aren't you?

41:11.520 --> 41:14.600
-I think it's pretty hot.
-There you go.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.800
First honest girl
I've ever met.

41:16.840 --> 41:21.040
So that was your 1 Series,
and then you moved up
quickly, age 19, I think?

41:21.080 --> 41:24.560
I won my first professional
golf tournament at 19

41:24.600 --> 41:27.920
and I always thought
the image of success
was a Ferrari,

41:27.960 --> 41:30.000
so I bought a Ferrari at 19.

41:30.040 --> 41:32.400
How the hell
did you insure it?

41:32.440 --> 41:36.880
The premium was quite high.

41:36.920 --> 41:39.520
-Make it live for us.
-25 grand a year.

41:41.840 --> 41:43.640
You need to win
a lot of golf.

41:43.680 --> 41:45.800
Yeah, you do, yeah, yeah.

41:45.840 --> 41:47.760
And did that kindle
a love of Ferraris?

41:47.800 --> 41:50.160
It did, yeah. And
I always knew that
you've loved Ferraris

41:50.200 --> 41:52.920
and the reason that
I have the cars that
I have at the minute,

41:52.960 --> 41:56.240
I saw you test drive
the F12 that I have.

41:56.280 --> 41:58.680
Oh, the F12?
That's a scary car.

41:58.720 --> 42:00.160
-Yeah.

42:00.200 --> 42:02.160
That's a really,
that's almost too fast.

42:02.200 --> 42:03.720
And didn't you get
a LaFerrari?

42:03.760 --> 42:04.920
I've got a LaFerrari, yeah.

42:04.960 --> 42:07.920
No, cos why did you go for a
LaFerrari and not a P1,

42:07.960 --> 42:10.160
which I proved on this show
was better?

42:10.200 --> 42:12.400
I would have killed myself
in a P1, I think.

42:12.440 --> 42:14.360
The P1 is nuts,
but they are brilliant.

42:14.400 --> 42:16.400
-I mean,
the LaFerrari is also...
-It's incredible.

42:16.440 --> 42:19.240
I haven't taken
the LaFerrari on a track

42:19.280 --> 42:21.280
like what we obviously
did today,

42:21.320 --> 42:23.080
and I don't know
if I'd want to.

42:23.120 --> 42:25.360
I'd be so scared
of flipping it or rolling it.

42:25.400 --> 42:27.200
That's where it belongs,
on a track.

42:27.240 --> 42:30.680
-I know, I just...
I'm scared.

42:30.720 --> 42:32.400
That's an impressive
car collection.

42:32.440 --> 42:34.080
Well, not really
a collection,

42:34.120 --> 42:35.840
but two really
super-fast Ferraris.

42:35.880 --> 42:38.080
But yours is not far behind,
cos you've got a McLaren.

42:38.120 --> 42:39.840
Yes.

42:39.880 --> 42:42.480
-I love it.

42:42.520 --> 42:44.160
I think it's just such
a sexy car.

42:44.200 --> 42:47.040
It is. And then, and
I really hate to say this,

42:47.080 --> 42:49.520
my favourite car in the whole
wide world, you also own.

42:49.560 --> 42:53.120
Which is slightly
murderous, actually,
is the word I'm looking for.

42:53.160 --> 42:54.800
You've got a Lexus LFA.

42:54.840 --> 42:57.200
I actually got the second one
they ever made.

42:57.240 --> 42:59.600
-So I was so excited.

42:59.640 --> 43:00.760
And just driving
on the street,

43:00.800 --> 43:02.400
no one had ever
seen it before

43:02.440 --> 43:04.400
so they looked at it
like a UFO or something.

43:04.440 --> 43:05.560
That is definitely
a head-turner.

43:05.600 --> 43:07.360
Didn't you drive
a Bentley every day?

43:07.400 --> 43:10.520
Yes, I actually had
a Bentley custom-made

43:10.560 --> 43:14.000
so it's all baby pink
with crystals on it.

43:14.040 --> 43:15.360
-Oh, wow, that's...
-There you go.

43:15.400 --> 43:17.880
It's very pink. I used
to drive it all the time,

43:17.920 --> 43:21.280
but when I drive it,
it's literally like
Mickey Mouse at Disneyland.

43:21.320 --> 43:23.120
People are pulling over
on the freeway.

43:23.160 --> 43:25.600
-I wonder why.
-Taking selfies.

43:25.640 --> 43:27.360
It causes, like,
accidents almost,

43:27.400 --> 43:29.840
so I try to keep it
at home now.

43:29.880 --> 43:32.760
Anyway, listen. You obviously
came to do your laps.

43:32.800 --> 43:35.720
There's no snow this week,
which is good,
but it's still quite greasy.

43:35.760 --> 43:37.560
-It was icy.
-Yeah, it was
a little greasy.

43:37.600 --> 43:40.800
Icy and greasy, so we're
not gonna be looking
for a record time today.

43:40.840 --> 43:43.600
And you were seriously
pushing it, by all accounts.

43:43.640 --> 43:46.960
I was. I love driving fast.

43:47.000 --> 43:50.960
And I love when there's
no cops around
to pull me over, so it's...

43:51.000 --> 43:56.880
Exactly. Well, anybody
wanna see an outtake
of Paris trying really hard?

43:56.920 --> 43:59.280
Let's have a look.
This is the last corner,

43:59.320 --> 44:01.120
which you've
gotta slow down for.

44:01.160 --> 44:03.680
Which we obviously never told
the poor girl, here we go.

44:03.720 --> 44:05.520
Shit!

44:09.360 --> 44:12.600
That's a properly big one,
and well done.

44:12.640 --> 44:15.000
-Thanks.

44:15.040 --> 44:18.120
You did have
a problem, apparently,
with that last corner?

44:18.160 --> 44:20.520
Because I just wanted
to go so fast at the end

44:20.560 --> 44:22.840
and then just
making that right...

44:22.880 --> 44:25.400
You've gotta slow
right down to get round.

44:25.440 --> 44:26.920
I thought I was
gonna flip over,

44:26.960 --> 44:28.520
I was actually really
scared at that point.

44:28.560 --> 44:31.480
Would anybody like
to see Paris's actual lap?

44:31.520 --> 44:33.080
AUDIENCE: Yes!

44:33.120 --> 44:34.760
Let's play the tape!

44:37.160 --> 44:39.640
JEREMY: Yep,
that's an aggressive start.

44:39.680 --> 44:42.040
Let's go!

44:42.080 --> 44:44.240
OK, the first S.

44:44.280 --> 44:47.160
Ooh, beautifully done,
keeping it very tidy.

44:47.200 --> 44:49.600
I like to brake there.

44:49.640 --> 44:53.720
Was that left foot braking?
Probably not.
That's panic braking.

44:53.760 --> 44:55.480
Ooh, I say,
that's the tail out, there.

44:55.520 --> 44:58.080
On to the difficult bit.

44:58.120 --> 44:59.520
And how are we
gonna handle this?

44:59.560 --> 45:04.080
First right,
wide, but nicely held.

45:04.120 --> 45:06.600
And completely off the track.

45:06.640 --> 45:08.640
But that's OK,
back on it again now.

45:08.680 --> 45:10.480
rocks!

45:10.520 --> 45:11.720
The what

45:11.760 --> 45:15.680
Ooh, that's some
family-friendly words there.

45:15.720 --> 45:18.680
Through the gravel cell,
still looking tidy,

45:18.720 --> 45:21.520
not necessarily the wrong
thing to do, keeping it tidy.

45:21.560 --> 45:22.880
Ooh, that's wild.

45:22.920 --> 45:25.240
And now trying
to get in shape,

45:25.280 --> 45:27.160
ready to go back
on the tarmac.

45:27.200 --> 45:28.440
I bet this was slippery, too.

45:28.480 --> 45:29.880
Ooh, no, you've done
that beautifully.

45:29.920 --> 45:31.800
And then...

45:31.840 --> 45:34.080
Right, now,
round the final left

45:34.120 --> 45:36.520
and on to the straight
flat out.

45:36.560 --> 45:39.240
Let's do it!

45:39.280 --> 45:41.720
Now, this isn't your
tricky bit. This is now.

45:41.760 --> 45:43.200
You've gotta start braking...

45:43.240 --> 45:44.880
Now.

45:44.920 --> 45:47.360
And do you?

45:47.400 --> 45:51.760
Oh, yeah. That's heavy,
that was probably
too much braking,

45:51.800 --> 45:53.880
but there we are,
anyway, you've made it
across the line.

45:53.920 --> 45:55.360
Nicely done.

45:56.520 --> 45:58.400
Good.

45:58.440 --> 45:59.640
Looks good.

46:01.160 --> 46:03.360
So what do you reckon,
then, now you've seen that?

46:03.400 --> 46:05.000
Are you feeling nervous?

46:05.040 --> 46:06.320
-Yeah.

46:06.360 --> 46:07.920
Anyone wanna see Rory's lap?

46:07.960 --> 46:09.360
PARIS: Yeah!
AUDIENCE: Yes!

46:09.400 --> 46:11.280
Let's see if you chose
the wrong sport.

46:11.320 --> 46:12.600
Here we go.

46:14.200 --> 46:17.200
Right, and we are underway.

46:17.240 --> 46:20.960
Third, fourth..
Brake at the 50 board.

46:21.000 --> 46:24.240
JEREMY: This is a man
who's been listening to
the instructors, haven't you?

46:24.280 --> 46:26.440
You can tell,
that's nicely done.

46:26.480 --> 46:29.760
Listening to the instructors
is always the key, really.

46:29.800 --> 46:31.920
Most men think, "I can
go better than they do.

46:31.960 --> 46:33.520
I know more than they do."

46:33.560 --> 46:36.600
Right and... Holding it on.

46:36.640 --> 46:38.480
Yeah, are we gonna
take the Paris line?

46:38.520 --> 46:40.240
No, we're gonna stick
on the actual track.

46:40.280 --> 46:43.200
Ah, little bit. Don't let it
get too sideways, Rory!

46:45.440 --> 46:47.640
Yep, that's beautifully
held through there.

46:49.160 --> 46:51.560
Smooth power application,
yep.

46:51.600 --> 46:54.560
More of it.
Should have done this,
you're in the wrong sport.

46:54.600 --> 46:56.080
Ah, I dunno.

46:56.120 --> 46:57.560
No, this is looking
very good indeed.

46:57.600 --> 46:59.480
Are we gonna be able
to control it here?

46:59.520 --> 47:02.000
Very nice in,
keeping it to the right.

47:02.040 --> 47:04.080
Which puts you in the right
place for that left.

47:04.120 --> 47:06.800
You've managed to keep
two tyres on the track,
so that's all right.

47:06.840 --> 47:08.240
And off we go.

47:08.280 --> 47:10.280
OK, come on,
lift a little, turn in!

47:12.040 --> 47:13.640
Probably not flat
through there today.

47:13.680 --> 47:15.240
It's too slippery, too icy.

47:15.280 --> 47:17.000
RORY: Here's the corner
we were having trouble with.

47:17.040 --> 47:19.400
JEREMY: This is the tricky
one, the last corner.

47:19.440 --> 47:22.480
Ooh, bit of understeer
but just keeping it...

47:22.520 --> 47:23.880
Oh, no!

47:23.920 --> 47:26.440
Just about made it
across the line!

47:28.000 --> 47:29.240
Oh, yeah.

47:31.800 --> 47:33.160
So there we are.

47:35.360 --> 47:37.520
Right, so just so you know,

47:37.560 --> 47:39.280
I've got some times
we've had.

47:39.320 --> 47:42.440
Fastest so far 1:17,
Kevin Pietersen.

47:42.480 --> 47:45.600
Slowest, Dynamo,
last week, 1.39.3.

47:45.640 --> 47:48.000
But the track was
two feet deep in snow

47:48.040 --> 47:49.640
so he has got an excuse.

47:49.680 --> 47:51.080
-Oh, my goodness.
-He does.

47:51.120 --> 47:52.920
Got your times here.

47:52.960 --> 47:54.920
Paris Hilton...

47:56.400 --> 47:58.600
1.25.8.

47:58.640 --> 48:01.640
So that puts you - have
a round of applause for that.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.040
You're faster than two people
you've never heard of:

48:06.080 --> 48:11.280
Alfie Boe and Bill Bailey
are both, well, round
about that sort of time, OK?

48:11.320 --> 48:15.720
1.25.8, that's the time
you've gotta beat
on a greasy track, Rory.

48:17.680 --> 48:19.600
One...

48:19.640 --> 48:21.960
21...

48:22.000 --> 48:23.720
-Ooh.
-...point 9.

48:23.760 --> 48:25.520
That is a very good time.

48:26.720 --> 48:28.400
Very good time.

48:30.880 --> 48:32.160
Faster than Hugh Bonneville.

48:32.200 --> 48:35.360
-There you go.
-Faster than Hugh Bonneville,
and he was on a dry track.

48:35.400 --> 48:37.320
So that was extremely good.

48:37.360 --> 48:40.080
-I can't thank you enough
for coming, I really can't.
-Thank you for having us.

48:40.120 --> 48:42.000
Pleasure to have you here.
Ladies and gentlemen,

48:42.040 --> 48:46.480
Paris Hilton, and the world's
fastest golfing enthusiast,
Rory McIlroy!

48:51.560 --> 48:54.320
Now. Now.

48:54.360 --> 48:57.080
Earlier on,
we were in Canada,

48:57.120 --> 48:59.480
where we proved that
medium-sized SUVs

48:59.520 --> 49:01.760
are useless at everything.

49:01.800 --> 49:06.400
But Mr Willman said the tests
we'd done were idiotic.

49:06.440 --> 49:09.240
Yeah, he said people actually
buy them to go canoeing

49:09.280 --> 49:11.400
and hiking
and mountain biking,

49:11.440 --> 49:14.440
and he then also said
that we could only come home

49:14.480 --> 49:17.360
once we'd completed
one more challenge.

49:32.400 --> 49:35.200
JAMES: Why are we
towing speedboats?

49:35.240 --> 49:36.480
Never mind that, James.

49:36.520 --> 49:39.320
Why have you bought
a brown speedboat?

49:39.360 --> 49:41.400
Er, it's orange.

49:41.440 --> 49:43.240
Never mind James's
brown speed boat,

49:43.280 --> 49:45.400
where's your Alfa Romeo?

49:45.440 --> 49:47.880
It was stolen.

49:47.920 --> 49:49.640
-No, it wasn't.
- It was!

49:49.680 --> 49:52.920
I came out of the hotel this
morning, it was just gone.
Literally gone.

49:52.960 --> 49:56.360
You know Canada is number one
in the world for car theft?

49:56.400 --> 49:57.680
No, it isn't.

49:57.720 --> 49:59.800
So what I've done
is I've replaced it

49:59.840 --> 50:02.880
with this Ford F150
pickup truck,

50:02.920 --> 50:05.760
which is the best-selling
vehicle, not just in Canada,

50:05.800 --> 50:08.040
but the entire world.

50:08.080 --> 50:11.760
Yeah, but the fact is
you've replaced your Alfa

50:11.800 --> 50:14.240
because we were told
to tow speedboats

50:14.280 --> 50:16.800
and you can't fit
a towbar to a Stelvio.

50:18.160 --> 50:21.320
The problem is that they've
routed the exhaust

50:21.360 --> 50:22.680
on the Stelvio in such a way

50:22.720 --> 50:25.160
that you can't, actually, as
Hammond says, fit a towbar.

50:25.200 --> 50:27.480
I think the thing is,

50:27.520 --> 50:31.480
that in Italy it's unmanly
and undignified
to tow something.

50:32.600 --> 50:34.080
I mean, why would
they tow something?

50:34.120 --> 50:35.280
It just slows you down.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.240
Soon, we arrived
at the start point

50:40.280 --> 50:42.360
for Mr Willman's challenge.

50:42.400 --> 50:45.920
Which was precisely
in the middle of nowhere.

50:48.400 --> 50:50.320
JEREMY: James...

50:50.360 --> 50:51.720
This is a skip.

50:51.760 --> 50:53.640
No, it's just all stuff
that was thrown in.

50:53.680 --> 50:55.760
Literally thrown in, yeah.

50:55.800 --> 50:58.560
-It's all boat stuff.
There's a traffic cone.

50:58.600 --> 51:00.600
Well, that's probably
something to do with boating.

51:00.640 --> 51:02.080
It isn't anything
to do with boating!

51:02.120 --> 51:03.960
This is an oar
and a boat suit and...

51:04.000 --> 51:06.080
-Looking for bears.

51:06.120 --> 51:07.440
Why?

51:07.480 --> 51:10.360
Because one of the
things I don't wanna be
is eaten by a bear.

51:10.400 --> 51:12.640
I wouldn't worry about
being eaten by one.

51:12.680 --> 51:14.000
Well, I do.

51:14.040 --> 51:15.480
Well,
they do far worse than that.

51:15.520 --> 51:18.240
-Hang on, hang on,
we have a message,

51:18.280 --> 51:20.120
and it's from Mr Willman.

51:20.160 --> 51:23.920
"Each of your cars
has been fitted with
a satellite compass

51:23.960 --> 51:25.880
which will direct you
to the finish line.

51:25.920 --> 51:30.040
Whoever arrives first can
claim to have the best SUV."

51:30.080 --> 51:31.320
Well, that's me.

51:31.360 --> 51:33.360
Well, apart from
you haven't got an SUV.

51:33.400 --> 51:35.080
It's got a twin
turbo-charged V6 -

51:35.120 --> 51:36.400
same as the Alfa.

51:36.440 --> 51:38.120
Four-wheel drive,
same as the Alfa.

51:38.160 --> 51:40.520
It's exactly the same colour.

51:40.560 --> 51:43.600
JEREMY: With all that
cleared up... the race began.

51:43.640 --> 51:45.960
-Ah!

51:46.000 --> 51:47.680
Right, where are we
now? There.

51:47.720 --> 51:51.680
My compass thing
says I've gotta go
in that direction

51:51.720 --> 51:53.800
for 5.1 kilometres.

51:54.960 --> 51:56.960
How hard can that be?

52:00.400 --> 52:04.760
Come on, little Porsche,
this is your chance to show
your off-road credentials.

52:04.800 --> 52:07.800
The Porsche is the only one
with a proper four-wheel
drive system for this.

52:07.840 --> 52:10.200
It can divert all of its
power to the front wheels

52:10.240 --> 52:12.720
so it can scrabble its way
out of trouble like a dog,

52:12.760 --> 52:14.440
pulling itself
with its front legs.

52:16.600 --> 52:20.720
Right. Typical of those two,
just roar off
being brilliant.

52:20.760 --> 52:23.040
Let's have a look
at the map first.

52:26.520 --> 52:28.360
Might just go
straight up here.

52:28.400 --> 52:30.440
Through these nettles.

52:30.480 --> 52:32.840
What are they,
Christmas trees?
I don't know what they are.

52:37.760 --> 52:39.800
If you really want
to go off-road,

52:39.840 --> 52:41.600
you need a real off-roader.

52:41.640 --> 52:45.680
A Range Rover,
a Land Cruiser, a Raptor.

52:45.720 --> 52:47.960
There's no point messing
around with a little SUV.

52:48.000 --> 52:49.240
It's not gonna go anywhere.

52:50.400 --> 52:51.640
Speaking of which...

52:56.080 --> 52:57.800
RICHARD: Oh, I'm stuck.

52:57.840 --> 53:00.000
I'm going backwards now.

53:03.680 --> 53:09.200
So I'm going west-northwest.
That's high terrain...

53:09.240 --> 53:11.720
That's very high,
I want to avoid that.
I should try to...

53:14.840 --> 53:16.440
Come on, come on.

53:22.280 --> 53:25.000
Four-wheel drive overload,
rear-wheel drive only.

53:25.040 --> 53:26.680
Reduce engine load.

53:26.720 --> 53:28.360
It doesn't work!

53:28.400 --> 53:30.600
I need another route.

53:30.640 --> 53:34.320
RICHARD: James, meanwhile,
had sorted out his route

53:34.360 --> 53:36.800
and was now
sorting out his car.

53:36.840 --> 53:40.640
I'm putting my
response system
in grass, gravel and snow.

53:40.680 --> 53:42.160
It has just started snowing.

53:42.200 --> 53:43.480
-I also have--

53:43.520 --> 53:45.520
Who the hell is that?

53:45.560 --> 53:47.520
It's Hammond, look,
he's got exactly nowhere.

53:48.840 --> 53:50.240
What a spanner.

53:50.280 --> 53:52.880
Anyway.

53:52.920 --> 53:55.880
JEREMY: With both
my colleagues still
on the start line,

53:55.920 --> 53:58.320
I was winning by miles.

54:00.080 --> 54:02.320
This is a very narrow
little path, this one.

54:02.360 --> 54:04.280
I don't want to be
making a mess... Oh, hello.

54:06.080 --> 54:07.560
Right.

54:07.600 --> 54:10.880
What that is
is a fallen-down tree.

54:10.920 --> 54:13.520
How the hell do you
reverse a trailer?

54:16.320 --> 54:18.760
So if I turn the steering
wheel this way...

54:21.040 --> 54:23.760
This way.

54:23.800 --> 54:26.120
Yeah, I've got it,
I've got it.

54:28.120 --> 54:30.320
This is a bit... No, not...

54:30.360 --> 54:33.640
Oh, shit, no! Ooh, God!

54:37.280 --> 54:39.800
Boat is still attached,
correct.

54:39.840 --> 54:42.400
Direction, roughly right.

54:42.440 --> 54:44.440
Everything's excellent.

54:46.120 --> 54:47.760
Plenty of power,
this is good.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.080
Right,
arrow's pointing that way.

54:55.520 --> 54:57.280
Now we're making progress.

54:58.840 --> 55:02.400
I want to go...
If I turn into the...

55:04.840 --> 55:06.120
No, this way.

55:09.320 --> 55:11.120
Oh, Christ, that's not right.

55:11.160 --> 55:13.920
JEREMY: Having carefully
unhitched the trailer...

55:14.920 --> 55:16.080
Right.

55:16.120 --> 55:19.280
I was soon turned round
and back on the move

55:19.320 --> 55:22.400
looking for another route.

55:22.440 --> 55:27.320
Trailers definitely
have an intelligence.

55:27.360 --> 55:29.760
They have a mind of their own
and it's a vindictive mind.

55:29.800 --> 55:31.480
It wants you to fail.

55:34.640 --> 55:36.760
JEREMY: And, thanks
to its vindictiveness,

55:36.800 --> 55:39.680
all of my lead in this
important race was gone.

55:44.440 --> 55:46.840
Quite ballsy of
Land Rover, really,

55:46.880 --> 55:51.600
to build a car that doesn't
have a low-ratio gearbox.

55:51.640 --> 55:53.960
But there is a lot of
electronically-controlled
stuff.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.760
The central diff,
for example - it just
locked for me then.

55:56.800 --> 55:59.560
I can feel it
working stuff out,

55:59.600 --> 56:01.880
finding the grip
on different wheels.

56:03.320 --> 56:05.200
And it works: look at that.

56:09.360 --> 56:11.360
My off-road work
is exceptional.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.880
How long before James May
says keep your thumbs
out of the steering wheel?

56:16.920 --> 56:19.400
It's all he knows
about off-roading.

56:19.440 --> 56:22.400
Thumbs outside
the steering wheel
in case it kicks.

56:24.400 --> 56:27.080
Mud ruts selected.

56:27.120 --> 56:29.880
Just because it's gone
a bit slippery.

56:29.920 --> 56:33.800
JAMES: But then,
I too hit a dead end.

56:33.840 --> 56:35.040
Oh, cock.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.160
Right, trailer reversing tip,

56:39.200 --> 56:43.360
if I look in the mirror
and I say I want
the boat to go that side,

56:43.400 --> 56:45.360
I lift that hand.

56:45.400 --> 56:47.640
So you look in the mirror.
So I'll do that...

56:54.640 --> 56:56.320
Right,
well, I am getting closer

56:56.360 --> 56:57.960
according to
my electronic compass.

56:58.000 --> 56:59.320
This is looking good.

57:00.720 --> 57:02.720
I've just gotta hope
they don't find this track.

57:04.680 --> 57:08.760
To be honest, in the Raptor,
I didn't need a track.

57:10.440 --> 57:11.960
I'm not a fan of
pickup trucks

57:12.000 --> 57:14.240
and I will kill you
if you ever tell
Richard Hammond this,

57:14.280 --> 57:15.840
but this is impressive.

57:17.280 --> 57:19.560
It's just drumming its
fingers coming along here.

57:19.600 --> 57:22.440
I mean, if I'd have asked it
to tow a battleship,

57:22.480 --> 57:26.240
maybe it would be
struggling a bit,
but a speedboat? Pah.

57:31.800 --> 57:34.120
Yes! Well done you,
little car!

57:36.000 --> 57:37.880
Do you know,
I'm gonna win this.

57:39.520 --> 57:41.200
Oh, hang on a minute.

57:44.240 --> 57:46.880
This thing's telling me,
it must be the other
side of the lake.

57:49.280 --> 57:50.520
I can see a flag.

57:50.560 --> 57:52.000
There's a flag. It's there.

57:53.360 --> 57:54.920
Clearly,
it would be impossible

57:54.960 --> 57:57.960
to drive the Macan
round the shoreline.

57:58.000 --> 58:02.280
So I needed
to break out the map
and find another route.

58:02.320 --> 58:04.160
A track, a track, a track.
There will be one.

58:05.720 --> 58:07.800
Oh...
Oh, good.

58:09.720 --> 58:11.760
JEREMY:
Why've you stopped here?
Finish line's over there.

58:11.800 --> 58:14.920
Yes, I know, I'm just
working out how to get there!

58:14.960 --> 58:17.680
You just drive round the
outside, look, on the beach.

58:17.720 --> 58:19.320
I can't do that.

58:19.360 --> 58:21.080
That's cos you're
in the wrong car.

58:21.120 --> 58:23.720
-No, you're in the wrong car.
-I'm not in the wrong car!

58:23.760 --> 58:26.360
You are!

58:26.400 --> 58:28.400
JEREMY: Rather
than have a pointless
debate about this,

58:30.080 --> 58:33.920
I decided to let
the Raptor do the talking.

58:33.960 --> 58:36.560
Here we go. Oh, yep.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.200
JAMES:
Meanwhile, very far back,

58:40.240 --> 58:41.840
in a blizzard, on a hill,

58:41.880 --> 58:44.280
the Velar's electronics,
predictably,

58:44.320 --> 58:46.360
were starting to struggle.

58:46.400 --> 58:50.280
Right, no traction launch.
Activate.

58:52.320 --> 58:54.240
Doesn't like it.

58:54.280 --> 58:55.920
Oh, no!

58:57.160 --> 59:00.040
I've gotta be honest,
I'm a bit disappointed.

59:00.080 --> 59:02.480
I'm using absolutely
everything on here.

59:05.280 --> 59:06.880
No.

59:10.320 --> 59:11.720
Come on. There you go.

59:14.760 --> 59:17.240
Oh! What's that big bump?

59:17.280 --> 59:19.520
This beach is woodier
than I thought.

59:20.960 --> 59:23.480
But the speedboat is still
upright, and that's good.

59:23.520 --> 59:25.800
And round we go.

59:27.680 --> 59:30.920
Ooh. Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

59:30.960 --> 59:33.320
No! Bloody hell!

59:35.240 --> 59:37.480
Distance, reducing.

59:37.520 --> 59:40.520
Hill descent control
is automatically on.

59:40.560 --> 59:43.360
Controlling the speed
with my thumb.

59:43.400 --> 59:47.480
It's excellent at going down
hills, this Range Rover.

59:47.520 --> 59:49.200
Not so sure
about it going up them.

59:49.240 --> 59:53.080
JEREMY: Having righted
the boat with no help
from any of the film crew...

59:55.840 --> 59:58.240
I was back on the move.

59:59.640 --> 1:00:02.080
Stop just dithering about.

1:00:03.560 --> 1:00:05.120
Ooh, God!

1:00:10.800 --> 1:00:12.440
Found it.

1:00:13.640 --> 1:00:16.120
This is what we need.

1:00:16.160 --> 1:00:18.560
Proper track.
It's farther from the lake,
I'll have further to go

1:00:18.600 --> 1:00:20.920
but I can get a move on.

1:00:20.960 --> 1:00:22.680
Now we've got
a race on our hands.

1:00:24.040 --> 1:00:26.600
JAMES: Eventually,
I arrived at the lake,

1:00:26.640 --> 1:00:28.840
but I wasn't worried
about how far back I was

1:00:28.880 --> 1:00:32.080
because I'd had an idea.

1:00:33.440 --> 1:00:35.400
That message from Mr Willman,

1:00:35.440 --> 1:00:38.680
it said the first person
to get to the finishing
line, didn't it?

1:00:38.720 --> 1:00:40.360
-Yes.

1:00:40.400 --> 1:00:43.080
The first person. Didn't
say anything about the car.

1:00:43.120 --> 1:00:47.560
So why don't I just unload
the boat and boat across?

1:00:47.600 --> 1:00:50.680
JEREMY: Meanwhile,
I'd left the difficult beach
through a wood

1:00:52.280 --> 1:00:56.000
and was on a track
with a problem.

1:00:56.040 --> 1:00:59.080
My vindictive trailer has now
decided to have a puncture.

1:01:02.360 --> 1:01:06.000
Well, I'm going to pay
it back by not stopping
cos I haven't got time.

1:01:06.040 --> 1:01:10.800
JEREMY: I didn't even stop
when the vindictive trailer
decided to be on fire.

1:01:20.760 --> 1:01:22.760
Oh, I'm gonna
lose that outboard.

1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:30.920
Boat suit.

1:01:36.160 --> 1:01:40.520
One wheel on my wagon
and I'm still rolling along.

1:01:40.560 --> 1:01:43.880
This is good.
This is very good.

1:01:43.920 --> 1:01:45.720
But then...

1:01:45.760 --> 1:01:47.360
Bloody hell.

1:01:47.400 --> 1:01:49.720
No! I'm in another dead end!

1:01:51.080 --> 1:01:52.880
There was only
one thing for it:

1:01:52.920 --> 1:01:55.400
another manual
three-point turn.

1:02:01.440 --> 1:02:06.440
This steel's just so
warm and comfortable!

1:02:11.040 --> 1:02:13.240
Whoa! Come on!

1:02:14.480 --> 1:02:15.760
Drifting my boat.

1:02:29.320 --> 1:02:30.920
I'm 57.

1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:35.800
No! No, no!

1:02:44.560 --> 1:02:46.240
Come on, come on, come on.

1:02:47.280 --> 1:02:48.920
Right.

1:02:48.960 --> 1:02:52.040
JAMES: Meanwhile, I was
ready for the final charge.

1:02:52.080 --> 1:02:53.640
Goodbye, losers.

1:02:53.680 --> 1:02:56.520
Ignition, start!

1:03:03.680 --> 1:03:06.520
Oh, cock.

1:03:08.200 --> 1:03:11.400
I'm just going
as fast as I dare.

1:03:15.520 --> 1:03:17.760
Speed... speed power.

1:03:20.120 --> 1:03:22.440
JAMES: With the other
two heading for failure,

1:03:22.480 --> 1:03:24.960
I got HMS Orange started

1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:28.360
and was cruising
to an easy win.

1:03:28.400 --> 1:03:29.880
This is just brilliant.

1:03:29.920 --> 1:03:31.720
Full throttle!

1:03:42.800 --> 1:03:44.280
Oh, cock.

1:03:44.320 --> 1:03:47.240
The boat is beginning
to behave oddly!

1:03:47.280 --> 1:03:51.360
There is a bit
of water coming in,
but it's not very far.

1:03:57.680 --> 1:03:59.200
Come on!

1:04:03.760 --> 1:04:05.120
There's the flag!

1:04:08.200 --> 1:04:10.960
Oh, really?

1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:12.720
Los-er!

1:04:12.760 --> 1:04:15.440
Oh, God.

1:04:15.480 --> 1:04:17.880
-Well, hang on a minute.

1:04:17.920 --> 1:04:19.320
Where's your boat?

1:04:19.360 --> 1:04:21.400
-It's there.
-No, it's not.

1:04:21.440 --> 1:04:23.720
It's just some bits of boat!

1:04:23.760 --> 1:04:26.200
It's a boat jigsaw.

1:04:26.240 --> 1:04:28.960
So you're finishing this race
without your car,

1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:31.800
without your trailer or
the boat that was on it...

1:04:31.840 --> 1:04:34.080
-I have got the boat!
-You've got
some bits of boat.

1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:36.200
-You're claiming
to be the winner.
-Listen.

1:04:36.240 --> 1:04:38.640
You've come second,
you're taking it badly.

1:04:38.680 --> 1:04:40.560
I think it doesn't matter

1:04:40.600 --> 1:04:43.760
because an even
more interesting race

1:04:43.800 --> 1:04:46.560
is developing out on
the water as we speak.

1:04:48.200 --> 1:04:50.800
Handling is affected
by water ingress!

1:04:50.840 --> 1:04:52.800
It's getting closer
to my kneecaps!

1:04:52.840 --> 1:04:55.640
Oh, Canadian flag, come on!

1:04:55.680 --> 1:05:00.160
Will he make it to the
finish point before he sinks?

1:05:00.200 --> 1:05:02.800
-That's got some tension
in it, hasn't it?
-I know!

1:05:02.840 --> 1:05:04.800
There's no tension here,
this is done.

1:05:04.840 --> 1:05:06.920
-Oh, yeah,
this is very tense.
-But we'll give you more.

1:05:06.960 --> 1:05:08.680
You two! Help!

1:05:08.720 --> 1:05:11.680
Come and rescue!
I'm going down!

1:05:11.720 --> 1:05:13.880
My boat's smashed
to pieces, James,

1:05:13.920 --> 1:05:15.440
I can't help you with that.

1:05:15.480 --> 1:05:19.600
My boat's, look,
it'll take me ages.
It's all the way over there!

1:05:19.640 --> 1:05:21.520
It's going down!

1:05:21.560 --> 1:05:24.480
I'd have to move mine
out of the way...

1:05:24.520 --> 1:05:27.120
And then I'd have
to walk up there,
along those rocks...

1:05:27.160 --> 1:05:30.360
It's gone! Oh, Jesus, ah!

1:05:30.400 --> 1:05:32.000
It's so cold!

1:05:32.040 --> 1:05:34.800
JEREMY: Look, he's going...
-Argh, you bastard!

1:05:34.840 --> 1:05:36.360
JEREMY: Have you ever seen...

1:05:36.400 --> 1:05:38.480
Argh! My testicles
are retreating!

1:05:38.520 --> 1:05:40.360
We don't need to know that!

1:05:40.400 --> 1:05:42.360
-Oh, no!

1:05:42.400 --> 1:05:44.520
-Ooh!
-Oh! Oh!

1:05:44.560 --> 1:05:46.400
That hurt me just watching!

1:05:46.440 --> 1:05:48.720
I've got a runny nose
thinking of it.

1:05:48.760 --> 1:05:50.000
My bits just shrivelled!

1:05:51.280 --> 1:05:54.080
-That was a cold, cold day.

1:05:54.120 --> 1:05:56.640
-I wouldn't want to be
in that water.

1:05:56.680 --> 1:05:59.560
-You couldn't help.
-l really wouldn't.

1:06:02.480 --> 1:06:06.760
What that film proves is
that if you want to buy
a Range Rover Velar

1:06:06.800 --> 1:06:08.840
or a Stelvio or a Macan,

1:06:08.880 --> 1:06:11.280
you're better off
with a Ford Raptor.

1:06:11.320 --> 1:06:15.440
Yeah, not only that,
the Raptor is actually
nearly half the price.

1:06:15.480 --> 1:06:18.440
Yes, but you can't
buy a Raptor in Britain.

1:06:18.480 --> 1:06:20.720
And so, on that terrible
disappointment,

1:06:20.760 --> 1:06:23.600
for you lot, at least,
it's time to end.

1:06:23.640 --> 1:06:25.440
Thank you so much
for watching, goodbye!
