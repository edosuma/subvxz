00:21.105 --> 00:22.982
"Never again, Mr. President,

00:23.023 --> 00:26.318
can we let the Chinese motorboat

your treaties?"

Dick Jr.

46:03.887 --> 46:07.807
Your wife was asleep,
and I saw his night-light on.

46:07.849 --> 46:10.393
"'Are you my mother?'
the baby bird asked a cow.

46:10.435 --> 46:12.520
"'How could I be your mother?

46:27.452 --> 46:30.038
Dick, this guy bothering you?

46:34.709 --> 46:36.419
Am I bothering you, Dick?

46:36.461 --> 46:39.506
Listen, ass-munch, I don't know
who the fuck you think you are.

46:39.547 --> 46:41.883
We got a problem?

46:43.259 --> 46:44.844
What the fuck?

46:53.937 --> 46:57.148
I know you'll keep tonight
between us,

46:57.190 --> 47:00.527
make sure your boys
keep their mouths shut.

47:00.568 --> 47:03.112
Otherwise, I can keep
their mouths shut for them.

47:03.154 --> 47:07.617
Please, no,
we-we'll-we'll keep quiet.

47:09.827 --> 47:13.039
Dick Jr. asked
if I was the monster

47:13.081 --> 47:16.209
under his bed.

47:16.251 --> 47:18.419
He said he was sure

47:18.461 --> 47:20.838
there was a monster
living there,

47:20.880 --> 47:22.882
but every time you would
go in to check...

47:22.924 --> 47:25.760
Under the bed, in the closet...

47:25.802 --> 47:29.305
You could never see it.

47:29.347 --> 47:32.892
Tell me, Congressman,

47:32.934 --> 47:35.144
do you see me now?

48:01.754 --> 48:04.257
Mr. Offerman
put up your bond, son.

48:05.800 --> 48:07.802
$1,200.

48:30.908 --> 48:34.495
You're free to go, for now.

48:35.830 --> 48:38.166
His driver's waiting
outside for you.

48:41.878 --> 48:44.714
I wasn't there to sell.

48:44.756 --> 48:47.133
I know why you were there.

48:48.760 --> 48:52.013
This has to stop now,

48:52.055 --> 48:54.891
before you get hurt.

48:54.932 --> 48:58.811
Leave the detective work to us.

48:58.853 --> 49:02.106
Detective work

49:02.148 --> 49:05.109
would be realizing
that the pattern

49:05.151 --> 49:08.404
of the locations
of your mystery rapist's crimes

49:08.446 --> 49:10.865
fits the A35 bus route

49:10.907 --> 49:13.785
to a T,

49:13.826 --> 49:16.579
so he must be taking
that bus line

49:16.621 --> 49:18.831
to his victims' apartments.

49:22.919 --> 49:25.463
Detective work

49:25.505 --> 49:29.258
would be finding
who killed my grandma.

49:29.300 --> 49:31.969
You're not doing detective work.

49:32.011 --> 49:34.555
All you're doing
is sitting around

49:34.597 --> 49:37.600
circle jerking to police
sketches of Son of Sam.

49:39.602 --> 49:42.021
Don't let me keep you
from busting a nut.

50:04.544 --> 50:07.755
Holy balls.

50:07.797 --> 50:09.841
He's expecting you.

50:17.765 --> 50:20.017
Well, I never.

50:20.059 --> 50:22.729
Holy mackerel, I don't know
how you boys do it.

50:22.770 --> 50:25.773
Doc, it's a masterpiece.

50:25.815 --> 50:28.109
Good work.

50:30.570 --> 50:34.741
"And God appointed a great fish

50:34.782 --> 50:37.076
"to swallow Jonah up.

50:37.118 --> 50:41.456

Jonah cried

50:41.497 --> 50:44.792
and God did hear his voice."

50:44.834 --> 50:48.129
You should read the Torah more.

50:48.171 --> 50:51.507
It is the original comic book.

50:51.549 --> 50:54.761

- I'm fine.

50:54.802 --> 50:56.846
Your face still looks like shit.

50:56.888 --> 51:00.099
- At least mine will heal.
- You will h... Uh, yeah.

51:00.141 --> 51:02.226
Well, you didn't tell me
you were Bruce Wayne rich.

51:02.268 --> 51:04.395
Well...

51:04.437 --> 51:06.689
What are you doing with this
Hell Devils? What is that?

51:06.731 --> 51:07.982
Please, can we...

51:08.024 --> 51:10.151
- Does that seem wise?
- I'm gonna pay you back,

51:10.193 --> 51:11.944
- every single penny of my bail.
- What? No.

51:11.986 --> 51:14.006
- I don't want your money,
please. Ugh. No.
- Just don't give me a speech.

51:14.030 --> 51:16.866
I forgive the loan
in its entirety.

51:16.908 --> 51:20.620
All I want from you
is the thrill

51:20.661 --> 51:24.791
of besting a Torah-ignorant punk

51:24.832 --> 51:27.001
in a chess match.

51:27.043 --> 51:29.045
What do you say?

51:31.047 --> 51:34.342
You know, there was
a very famous prisoner

51:34.383 --> 51:37.595
in Auschwitz

51:37.637 --> 51:42.141
named Markus Roth.

51:42.183 --> 51:45.812
He was the Bobby Fischer
of Germany.

51:45.853 --> 51:50.316
And as fate would have it,
one of the Nazi guards,

51:50.358 --> 51:53.653
a sadistic man named
Heinz Richter,

51:53.694 --> 51:57.198
he had always aspired
to be a great chess player, too,

51:57.240 --> 51:59.367
but for years, in tournaments,

51:59.408 --> 52:04.080
he was, he was trounced
by the chess-playing Jew,

52:04.121 --> 52:06.415
who was now his prisoner.

52:06.457 --> 52:09.377
Now, one morning in the camps,

52:09.418 --> 52:11.462
Richter rounded up Markus

52:11.504 --> 52:14.340
and 32 others,

52:14.382 --> 52:17.552
marched them into the woods.

52:17.593 --> 52:20.805
Each day, more prisoners

52:20.847 --> 52:24.225
were led into those same woods.

52:24.267 --> 52:27.895
One morning,

52:27.937 --> 52:31.983
your safta's younger sister

52:32.024 --> 52:33.651
was taken.

52:36.362 --> 52:38.322
Your safta,

52:38.364 --> 52:42.201
foolish and fearless,

52:42.243 --> 52:46.831
was determined
to rescue her dear Chava,

52:46.873 --> 52:50.793
so we snuck into the dark woods

52:50.835 --> 52:53.129
after them.

52:53.170 --> 52:56.757
And? What did you see?

52:56.799 --> 53:00.136
Well, in a small clearing...

53:00.177 --> 53:03.931
Richter had constructed
a human chessboard.

53:06.350 --> 53:09.562
On those squares
stood the prisoners...

53:12.607 --> 53:14.817
each one with a blade.

53:26.787 --> 53:30.416
Richter commanded the black,

53:30.458 --> 53:33.961
forced Markus to play
with the white.

53:34.003 --> 53:35.004
Bishop...

53:38.466 --> 53:39.759
to E3.

53:41.510 --> 53:43.179
I'm sorry, Chava.

54:00.321 --> 54:01.572
Chava!

54:22.218 --> 54:26.138
Chava didn't fare well.

54:30.393 --> 54:34.271
After seven days
of this torture,

54:34.313 --> 54:37.191
Markus Roth grabbed a blade,

54:37.233 --> 54:41.445
tried to kill
the barbarous Heinz Richter.

54:43.406 --> 54:45.616
Markus, of course,
was shot dead,

54:45.658 --> 54:49.328
but not before
he gave Richter a scar

54:49.370 --> 54:50.705
across his throat

54:50.746 --> 54:53.541
in the shape of an "X."

54:53.582 --> 54:57.336
Markus never lost
one match, however.

54:57.378 --> 55:00.464
Not one.

55:02.508 --> 55:06.804
Perhaps we can take
some solace in that.

55:08.681 --> 55:11.600
What I'd give to have killed
those motherfuckers.

55:11.642 --> 55:15.312
Your grandmother never told you
of such stories?

55:15.354 --> 55:18.607
Of our history? No?

55:18.649 --> 55:22.695
You rich folks have the luxury
of living in the past.

55:22.737 --> 55:26.073
Rest of us can only afford
the present.

55:26.115 --> 55:28.993
The past is all there is, Jonah,

55:29.035 --> 55:31.287
repeating over and over again,

55:31.328 --> 55:34.331
with new players of new times

55:34.373 --> 55:37.585
hoping for a different outcome.

55:44.300 --> 55:46.302
Checkmate.

55:52.767 --> 55:56.187
What, uh, what is this?

55:56.228 --> 55:58.457
Yeah, I call it beating an
old man's ass at his own game.

You're what they call
"a little shit," aren't you?

56:03.027 --> 56:05.047
- You want to play another...?
- The telephone is for you.

56:05.071 --> 56:07.615
It's the mayor's office.

56:07.656 --> 56:09.617
I should just be a moment.

Probably win that, too.

Dr. Fischer do for you?

Gretel was a chemist.

1:02:18.485 --> 1:02:20.863

1:02:36.795 --> 1:02:38.839
And what was she working on now?

1:02:38.881 --> 1:02:41.091
Dr. Fischer was...

1:02:41.133 --> 1:02:43.385
working on a chemical solution
that would heighten

1:02:43.427 --> 1:02:47.806
our astronauts' tolerance
of g-force from 16 to 30,

1:02:47.848 --> 1:02:49.641
highly theoretical work.

1:02:49.683 --> 1:02:53.395
That was completed back in 1954
when John Stapp harnessed

1:02:53.437 --> 1:02:57.441
nearly 46 Gs in the
U.S. Air Force tests, no?

1:02:59.318 --> 1:03:02.529
Sir, I'm not interviewing you
for Reader's Digest.

1:03:02.571 --> 1:03:04.198

1:03:04.239 --> 1:03:06.033

of one of your employees.

1:03:06.074 --> 1:03:07.719

1:03:09.119 --> 1:03:10.996

1:03:12.539 --> 1:03:14.791
Agent Morris,
if you would like to discuss

1:03:14.833 --> 1:03:17.628

classified research,

1:03:17.669 --> 1:03:20.839

on receipt of a warrant.

1:03:20.881 --> 1:03:26.053

Fuck you.

1:03:43.153 --> 1:03:45.781

1:04:09.596 --> 1:04:14.059
The Russians used to send each
of their cosmonauts into space

1:04:14.101 --> 1:04:16.061
with a sawed-off shotgun.

1:04:16.103 --> 1:04:18.146

against aliens.

1:04:18.188 --> 1:04:20.857
Nothing ridiculous like that.

1:04:20.899 --> 1:04:23.860
It was because
on their return to Earth,

1:04:23.902 --> 1:04:25.487
if they landed off course,

1:04:25.529 --> 1:04:27.197
they'd have to hike
hundreds of miles

1:04:27.239 --> 1:04:29.300

1:04:29.324 --> 1:04:33.120

When you land, Agent Morris,

1:19:08.161 --> 1:19:11.581
- Did you tell the authorities?
- Well, we tried, but...

1:19:11.622 --> 1:19:14.000
We went through
all the proper channels, so...

1:19:14.041 --> 1:19:19.505
law enforcement,
the courts, INS.

1:19:19.547 --> 1:19:22.300
But whether out of incompetence,

1:19:22.341 --> 1:19:24.802
ignorance, or animus,

1:19:24.844 --> 1:19:26.262
we were laughed at.

1:19:26.304 --> 1:19:28.264
They didn't believe us.

1:19:28.306 --> 1:19:31.767
So I took the matter
to the senators I knew,

1:19:31.809 --> 1:19:34.353
the congressmen
who I got elected,

1:19:34.395 --> 1:19:36.939
but they ignored me.

1:19:36.981 --> 1:19:41.569
No one cares
to stake their reputation

1:19:41.611 --> 1:19:46.407
on investigating
some Jew killers.

1:19:46.449 --> 1:19:50.203
So, with nowhere else to turn,

1:19:50.244 --> 1:19:52.330
we made a vow.

1:19:53.873 --> 1:19:57.293
We would find
these criminals ourselves...

1:19:59.504 --> 1:20:02.673
and bring God's justice

1:20:02.715 --> 1:20:05.009
to their doorstep.

1:20:08.554 --> 1:20:10.389
You mean murder them.

1:20:10.431 --> 1:20:11.390
Murder?

1:20:11.432 --> 1:20:14.435
No. No, Jonah.

1:20:14.477 --> 1:20:16.479
This is not murder.

1:20:17.605 --> 1:20:21.651
Before Jews even existed,

1:20:21.692 --> 1:20:25.238
hatred and slaughter
waited for us.

1:20:25.279 --> 1:20:28.533
For thousands of years,

1:20:28.574 --> 1:20:31.869
from Masada to Munich,
we have been massacred.

1:20:31.911 --> 1:20:36.832
Pharaohs and popes and princes
and popular votes

1:20:36.874 --> 1:20:40.836
calling for our blood.

1:20:40.878 --> 1:20:42.838
Now?

1:20:42.880 --> 1:20:45.591
We survive the war,

1:20:45.633 --> 1:20:49.679
we survive the greatest
mass eradication

1:20:49.720 --> 1:20:51.764
in modern history,

1:20:51.806 --> 1:20:55.685
and we arrive home to find

1:20:55.726 --> 1:20:57.979
that the people
who did this to us,

1:20:58.020 --> 1:21:01.190
they're our neighbors.

1:21:01.232 --> 1:21:05.570
So tell me, what should we do?

1:21:05.611 --> 1:21:08.364
Shake hands?

1:21:08.406 --> 1:21:11.033
Turn a blind eye?

1:21:11.075 --> 1:21:14.453
Forget? No, no.

1:21:17.832 --> 1:21:21.919
The greatest single gift
of the Jewish people

1:21:21.961 --> 1:21:24.880
is our capacity...

1:21:24.922 --> 1:21:27.967
our capacity to remember.

1:21:30.928 --> 1:21:33.556
And it's because of our memory

1:21:33.598 --> 1:21:37.101
that we know this is survival.

1:21:40.021 --> 1:21:42.732
This is not murder.

1:21:42.773 --> 1:21:44.358
This is mitzvah.

1:21:44.400 --> 1:21:47.361
The man from the market...

1:21:47.403 --> 1:21:50.156
became our first.

1:21:50.197 --> 1:21:55.036
Heinz is number seven.

1:21:56.996 --> 1:21:59.874
We number our kills.

1:21:59.915 --> 1:22:02.543
Eye for eye.

1:22:02.585 --> 1:22:07.381
Jonah, this is not because
we want for this.

1:22:07.423 --> 1:22:11.260
Because we have no choice.

1:22:11.302 --> 1:22:15.848
We must instill fear...

1:22:15.890 --> 1:22:18.392
send a message.

1:22:18.434 --> 1:22:21.270
Let them know...

1:22:21.312 --> 1:22:23.939
not again.

1:22:23.981 --> 1:22:25.775
No more.

1:22:27.276 --> 1:22:29.862
No more, Jonah.

1:22:31.530 --> 1:22:33.199
Nip it in the bud.

1:22:37.286 --> 1:22:39.288
Who is that? The Wolf?

1:22:40.956 --> 1:22:44.460
The Nazi doctor from Auschwitz.

1:22:44.502 --> 1:22:46.587
The monster of my story.

1:22:47.797 --> 1:22:50.257
Still haunts me to this day.

1:22:57.014 --> 1:22:59.141
The Talmud is wrong.

1:22:59.183 --> 1:23:02.061
Living well is not
the best revenge.

1:23:02.103 --> 1:23:04.063
You know what
the best revenge is?

1:23:04.105 --> 1:23:06.524
Revenge.

1:23:09.110 --> 1:23:13.698
I want in.
I want in.

1:23:16.075 --> 1:23:19.578
Your grandmother protected you
from all this.

1:23:19.620 --> 1:23:22.707
She risked her life
so you could live out yours.

1:23:22.748 --> 1:23:25.876
She's dead because of me.

1:23:25.918 --> 1:23:27.878
I will regret that
for the rest of my life.

1:23:27.920 --> 1:23:30.339
I have to do this.

1:23:32.174 --> 1:23:34.593
I can't allow it.

1:23:34.635 --> 1:23:35.803
No, it's my right.

1:23:35.845 --> 1:23:37.471
It's my choice.

1:23:37.513 --> 1:23:39.306
I found him.

1:23:39.348 --> 1:23:41.559
I did.

1:23:41.600 --> 1:23:44.937
You found what I could not.

1:23:53.863 --> 1:23:58.325
You found what I could not.

1:24:01.078 --> 1:24:04.248
Your grandmother said,
"A brilliant mind...

1:24:04.290 --> 1:24:06.709
from God, a gift."

1:24:08.210 --> 1:24:12.840
But you followed
in her footsteps today.

1:24:12.882 --> 1:24:15.801
You held her dagger.

1:24:18.929 --> 1:24:21.056
You did her work.

1:24:21.098 --> 1:24:26.020
Your grandmother wished

1:24:26.061 --> 1:24:29.690

1:24:29.732 --> 1:24:32.067
