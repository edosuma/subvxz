03:39.151 --> 03:41.278
- Coffee?
- Yeah, thank you.

03:43.489 --> 03:46.458
<i>How have you liked</i>
<i>your stay?</i>

03:46.525 --> 03:49.153
What I've seen, I've liked.

03:53.766 --> 03:56.894
<i>Please to explain why</i>
<i>I should agree to interview...</i>

03:56.969 --> 03:59.494
with pro-Zionist
American media?

04:01.173 --> 04:03.164
Because I think
Hezbollah...

04:03.242 --> 04:07.838
is trying to broaden into
a political party right now,

04:07.913 --> 04:10.575
so you care about what
you're thought of in America,

04:10.649 --> 04:13.516
and in America
at this moment in time,

04:13.585 --> 04:16.577
Hezbollah does not
have a face.

04:16.654 --> 04:20.785
- That's why.
- Perhaps you approve
journalism objectivity,

04:20.858 --> 04:22.793
and I see
the questions first.

04:22.861 --> 04:25.625
Then I decide if I grant
the interview.

04:25.697 --> 04:28.165
No.
We don't do that.

04:28.233 --> 04:31.566
You've seen <i>60 Minutes</i>
and Mike Wallace,

04:31.637 --> 04:34.868
so you know our reputation
for integrity and objectivity.

04:34.940 --> 04:39.343
You also know we are
the highest-rated, most-respected...

04:39.411 --> 04:42.847
TV magazine news show
in America.

04:50.689 --> 04:54.022
So, Mr. Wallace...
should he get on a plane or not?

04:55.861 --> 04:59.024
<i>Tell him I'll see him</i>
<i>day after tomorrow.</i>

04:59.097 --> 05:01.361
That's good.
That works.

05:04.102 --> 05:08.903
You know, I want to ask you something.
I know it sounds odd, but...

05:13.579 --> 05:15.513
Hello? Sheikh?

05:19.151 --> 05:21.711
Hello? Sheikh?

05:28.527 --> 05:30.927
- Norman?
- What? What?

05:30.996 --> 05:33.362
Take your blindfold off.

05:38.737 --> 05:41.865
<i>Welcome to the world.</i>

05:47.346 --> 05:49.940
Fluctuating
all over the place.

05:50.015 --> 05:54.418
Anywhere we shoot here, it's gonna
be portable gennies and we'll run cable.

06:04.363 --> 06:06.593
- Hello?
- Mike, it's me.

06:06.665 --> 06:09.498
We're on.

07:58.309 --> 08:01.608
Hi, honey.

08:01.679 --> 08:04.011
<i>- Hi, Daddy.</i>
- What's new?

08:04.082 --> 08:08.109
- Miss Loughrey gave me a star today.
- Yeah? What for?

08:08.186 --> 08:11.212
- For reading.
- That's great.

08:18.763 --> 08:21.755
A little early for cartoons,
isn't it?

08:22.900 --> 08:25.596
Okay.

08:31.843 --> 08:33.936
<i>Deborah? Debbie?</i>

08:43.187 --> 08:45.678
Oh, I didn't know
you were home.

08:45.757 --> 08:49.090
It's early,
isn't it?

08:49.160 --> 08:52.254
Gotta take Debbie to ballet.

08:53.331 --> 08:56.459
<i>Mommy!</i>

09:03.775 --> 09:05.709
Sweetheart, come on.
Come on.

09:05.777 --> 09:08.610
<i>- She was playing</i>
<i>with my Pooh doll again.</i>

09:08.679 --> 09:12.445
Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.
Breathe deep. Breathe deep.

09:14.685 --> 09:16.482
Slow down, honey. Slow down.

09:16.554 --> 09:19.421
Slow down.

09:19.490 --> 09:22.653
<i>Here we go.</i>
<i>Deep breaths.</i>

09:22.727 --> 09:25.195
- Deep breaths.
<i>- She was playing with the Pooh doll.</i>

09:25.263 --> 09:29.495
Pooh's dusty, sweetheart.
He's dusty, and you breathed him in.

09:29.567 --> 09:31.660
Okay? So, what's happening to you...
Look at me.

09:31.736 --> 09:34.432
What's happening to you now
is cells called mass cells...

09:34.505 --> 09:38.601
told your lungs, " Don't breathe
any more of that dust in."

09:38.676 --> 09:41.167
And the airways in your lungs
are like branches,

09:41.245 --> 09:45.147
and when the branches close up,
you get an asthmatic attack,

09:45.216 --> 09:48.014
and we give you medicine,
and you get better.

09:48.085 --> 09:50.553
Uh-huh? Okay?

09:50.621 --> 09:52.555
Better already,
aren't you?

10:00.531 --> 10:02.465
Okay, baby?

10:11.108 --> 10:13.474
Can I go to dance tomorrow?
I-I'm better.

10:13.544 --> 10:17.173
If you are, then I'll take Barbara
to soccer and take you to dance after.

10:17.248 --> 10:19.716
I can take her.

10:19.784 --> 10:23.311
Don't you have to
be at the office?

10:23.387 --> 10:26.845
- Is there any more rice?
- Yes, it's on the stove.

10:30.461 --> 10:32.429
<i>Do you want more rice?</i>

10:32.497 --> 10:34.988
<i>- Maybe later.</i>
<i>- How about you?</i>

10:35.066 --> 10:37.000
<i>- I'll take some.</i>
- Instant rice?

10:42.840 --> 10:44.808
<i>Can I go over to Jeanineâ€™s house?</i>

10:44.876 --> 10:49.313
- I'm sorry, darling.
Have you seen my coffee mug?
- Try the car.

11:11.235 --> 11:14.762
Um, what are
those boxes?

11:14.839 --> 11:17.831
- I'm going to the store.
You need anything?
- What do you need at the store?

11:17.909 --> 11:20.002
- Soy sauce.
- Right now?

11:20.077 --> 11:22.011
That's my stuff
from the office.

11:22.079 --> 11:24.673
Why did you take
your stuff from the office?

11:24.749 --> 11:27.445
- I didn't want to leave it there.
- I don't understand.

11:31.088 --> 11:34.216
I got fired
this morning.

11:34.292 --> 11:37.318
Where else am I
gonna take it?

11:37.395 --> 11:40.831
Why?
Who said?

11:40.898 --> 11:42.832
Thomas Sandefur.

11:47.338 --> 11:50.899
What are we
supposed to do?

11:50.975 --> 11:54.741
What about our medical coverage?
What about our health?

11:54.812 --> 11:59.545
What about our... car payments?
The payments on this house?

12:07.792 --> 12:10.317
The severance agreement
includes cash payoffs over time...

12:10.394 --> 12:13.158
and continuing
medical coverage.

12:13.230 --> 12:15.698
Sure you don't need anything?

12:15.766 --> 12:18.030
No, thank you.

12:25.843 --> 12:28.573
Jeffrey?

12:46.064 --> 12:50.626
I am very pleased to receive you
as my guest, Mr. Wallace.

12:50.702 --> 12:54.832
- Well, thank you for having us.
<i>- Think I got a problem with the gennie.</i>

12:54.906 --> 12:56.840
I gotta go outside.

12:59.844 --> 13:01.709
Give me a hand with this,
will you?

13:04.749 --> 13:06.717
Norman!

13:10.288 --> 13:13.485
- He says, uh, you must not sit so close.
- What?

13:14.959 --> 13:17.257
I can't conduct an interview
from back there.

13:20.965 --> 13:24.401
You must move back
your chair.

13:24.469 --> 13:27.131
Well, you tell him that when
I conduct an interview,

13:27.205 --> 13:30.402
I sit anywhere
I damn please.

13:35.980 --> 13:40.007
- There is no interview.
- You!

13:40.084 --> 13:45.249
I'm talking to you! What the hell do
you think I am, a 78-year-old assassin?

13:45.323 --> 13:48.690
You think I'm gonna karate him
to death with this notepad?

13:56.234 --> 13:57.724
- Are you interpreting what I'm saying?
- Yes.

13:57.802 --> 14:01.568
- We're there.
- Good. Well, ask him if Arabic
is his second language.

14:01.639 --> 14:03.869
Don't interpret that. Hold it.

14:03.942 --> 14:06.502
Hold it! Hold it!
Slow. Slow.

14:06.578 --> 14:09.240
Sheikh, do you mind?

14:09.314 --> 14:12.078
If you would just turn
your chair a little bit...

14:12.150 --> 14:14.846
to face Mr. Wallace.

14:16.487 --> 14:19.513
- Is that okay?
- Okay.

14:21.159 --> 14:23.855
Are you ready, or do you
wanna keep fucking around...

14:23.928 --> 14:25.862
and warm up some more?

14:25.930 --> 14:29.058
- No. I've got my heart started.
- Okay.

14:30.335 --> 14:32.701
All right, Todd.

14:33.838 --> 14:36.466
Give me the three-button
on Mike, please.

14:37.542 --> 14:41.137
Good. Good.

14:41.212 --> 14:44.477
Okay, we are rolling.

14:47.151 --> 14:50.314
<i>- Okay, Mike.</i>
- Sheikh Fadlallah.

14:50.388 --> 14:53.448
Thank you so much for seeing us.
Are you a terrorist?

14:54.859 --> 14:58.761
Mr. Wallace, I am
a servant of God.

14:58.830 --> 15:01.924
A servant of God?
Really?

15:02.000 --> 15:05.367
Americans believe that you...
as an Islamic fundamentalist...

15:05.436 --> 15:11.102
that you are a leader who contributed
to the bombing of the U.S. Embassy.

15:32.363 --> 15:37.767
Everybody thinks Canadian Mounties ride
horses and rescue ladies from rapids.

15:37.835 --> 15:41.202
Mike, they backed locals
in Oka in a fight with Mohawks...

15:41.272 --> 15:43.706
over building a golf course
on their burial site,

15:43.775 --> 15:46.471
They beat up protesters at Kanasake...

15:48.946 --> 15:50.880
- Where'd you hear that?
- Hello.

15:50.948 --> 15:54.816
Oh, someone took a poll?
"Are all things Canadian boring?"

15:54.886 --> 15:57.184
- It's Stuart. He's in Mexico City.
- Oh. Let me call you back.

15:58.256 --> 16:00.622
Yeah, Stuart?

16:00.692 --> 16:03.456
- What New York bank?
<i>- Hey, Dad.</i>

16:03.528 --> 16:06.725
Will he go on camera and talk
about the Mexico City branch?

16:06.798 --> 16:08.925
- Hey, Jake.
- Whose money are they laundering?

16:09.000 --> 16:12.197
- No classes this morning?
- I don't have to be there till 10:30.

16:12.270 --> 16:15.797
<i>- Hey, Mom. Hello.</i>
- Hi, sweetheart.

16:19.844 --> 16:22.472
- Hello? Yeah.
- Do independent sources corroborate?

16:27.452 --> 16:30.148
<i>- Dad, you got a box out here.</i>
- Let me see this a second.

16:30.221 --> 16:33.850
- 'Cause I gotta know where
you're going at all times.

16:45.670 --> 16:48.400
<i>I can't. I've gotta fly</i>
<i>to Boston tomorrow.</i>

16:48.473 --> 16:50.805
2:00 P.M. Great.

16:50.875 --> 16:54.641
- Bye-bye.
- "Ignition propensity."

16:54.712 --> 16:57.078
You understand
any of this?

17:00.585 --> 17:02.644
No.

17:03.821 --> 17:06.618
Uh, this looks like
a table of temperatures.

17:06.691 --> 17:10.218
- Who's this from?
- It's anonymous.

17:10.294 --> 17:12.854
References to "P.M."

17:12.930 --> 17:14.954
It's gotta be
Phillip Morris, huh?

17:15.031 --> 17:17.898
Hmm. I have to
take a shower.

17:35.186 --> 17:38.417
Yeah?

17:38.489 --> 17:40.457
Hi. This is
Doug Oliver.

17:40.525 --> 17:42.652
Oh, hi, Doug.
It's Lowell.

17:42.727 --> 17:46.390
I'm doing this story on fire
safety, and people burning up
from falling asleep smoking.

17:46.464 --> 17:50.924
I receive a shitload of scientific
papers from inside Phillip Morris.

17:51.002 --> 17:54.165
Anonymous. You or anybody
in F.D.A. Know someone...

17:54.238 --> 17:56.934
who can translate this stuff
into English for me?

17:57.008 --> 17:59.135
Uh, yeah.

18:15.626 --> 18:19.187
- Hello?
- Uh, Mr. Wigand, please?

18:19.263 --> 18:23.301
Someone's calling
for Daddy, Mom.

18:26.404 --> 18:28.736
- Oh. Thank you, Bob.
- Who's calling?

18:28.806 --> 18:31.001
Uh, my name
is Lowell Bergman.

18:31.075 --> 18:35.774
- Did you say "Berman"?
- No, Bergman. B-E-R-G-M-A-N.

18:35.846 --> 18:38.371
- I'm a producer for <i>60 Minutes.</i>
<i>- 60 Minutes?</i>

18:38.449 --> 18:41.418
- Yeah.
<i>- 60 Minutes,</i> the television show?

18:41.485 --> 18:44.886
- Yes.
- He doesn't want to talk to you.

18:47.124 --> 18:49.888
How does he know he doesn't
want to talk to me? He doesn't
know what I'm calling him about.

18:49.960 --> 18:52.520
He doesn't care to know.

19:14.618 --> 19:17.781
<i>This is the Wigands'.</i>

19:17.855 --> 19:21.347
<i>If you'd like to leave a message</i>
<i>or send a fax, start now.</i>

19:21.425 --> 19:24.394
<i>This is Lowell Bergman with</i> 60 Minutes,
<i>and I'm doing a story...</i>

19:24.462 --> 19:26.521
<i>on fire safety</i>
<i>and cigarettes.</i>

19:26.597 --> 19:29.691
<i>I have scientific documents</i>
<i>from a tobacco company,</i>

19:29.767 --> 19:32.531
<i>and I could use your help</i>
<i>as a consultant...</i>

19:32.603 --> 19:34.537
<i>explaining these documents</i>
<i>to me.</i>

19:34.605 --> 19:40.510
<i>Now, my number is</i>
<i>area code 510-555-0199.</i>

19:40.578 --> 19:45.345
<i>I'll be there at this number</i>
<i>in ten minutes.</i>

22:13.831 --> 22:16.891
If you're curious
to meet me,

22:16.967 --> 22:21.927
I'm gonna be in the lobby
of the Seelbach Hotel in Louisville...

22:22.006 --> 22:26.033
<i>reading</i> The New York Times
<i>tomorrow at 5:00.</i>

23:44.687 --> 23:47.281
<i>Have you always lived in Louisville?</i>

23:47.356 --> 23:51.486
Mr. Bergman, what did you
want me to consult about?

23:51.561 --> 23:55.088
Who's that?

23:56.766 --> 24:00.031
That's room service.

24:00.102 --> 24:02.866
They usually
knock first.

24:02.939 --> 24:05.134
Come on in.

24:05.208 --> 24:07.301
Over here, please.

24:16.285 --> 24:20.619
- Thank you.
- How do you like your coffee? Black?

24:20.690 --> 24:23.682
Black. Black.

24:23.759 --> 24:26.785
I really don't have that much time.

24:29.031 --> 24:31.693
Is there anything you want to know
about me, Mr. Wigand?

24:31.767 --> 24:33.894
Like what?
Your sign?

24:37.240 --> 24:39.299
I know what I
have to know.

24:39.375 --> 24:43.175
Just so I know you know,
when I talk to people in confidence,

24:43.246 --> 24:45.180
it stays that way.

24:47.617 --> 24:51.519
How did a radical journalist
from <i>Ramparts</i> magazine end up at CBS?

24:54.357 --> 24:56.848
I still do
the tough stories.

24:56.926 --> 24:59.292
<i>60 Minutes</i> reaches
a lot of people.

25:01.464 --> 25:03.659
Let me see
the documents.

25:31.894 --> 25:34.021
This is a, um,

25:34.096 --> 25:37.998
fire-safety product study
for Phillip Morris.

25:38.067 --> 25:42.026
Burn rates, ignition propensity,
things of this nature.

25:42.104 --> 25:44.971
I could very easily explain this
to you in layman's terms...

25:45.041 --> 25:46.975
because it's from
another company.

25:47.043 --> 25:50.809
- But that's as far as I go.
- As far as you go where?

25:51.881 --> 25:53.815
This issue is
a drop in the bucket.

25:53.883 --> 25:55.908
I can talk to you
about what's in here, but I...

25:55.985 --> 25:58.613
I can't talk to you
about anything else.

26:02.725 --> 26:05.922
I signed a confidentiality agreement.
I honor agreements.

26:09.999 --> 26:12.399
Doesn't CBS have confidentiality
agreements, Mr. Bergman?

26:12.468 --> 26:16.336
Between journalists and management,
yes, I believe they do.

26:16.405 --> 26:19.738
But I don't take that seriously.
Where do you work?

26:19.809 --> 26:21.743
Did work.

26:21.811 --> 26:25.941
<i>- Did</i> work?
- How much would I get paid?

26:29.285 --> 26:32.777
That you have to discuss
with CBS Business Affairs.

26:32.855 --> 26:37.485
But for something like this, I would
say anywhere between ten, 12 thousand.

26:41.430 --> 26:43.523
Should I just take
the documents now?

26:44.767 --> 26:47.292
If you want to do it.

26:53.943 --> 26:56.605
I worked as a, uh,

26:56.679 --> 26:59.580
head of Research and Development
for Brown & Williamson.

26:59.649 --> 27:02.140
Tobacco company.

27:05.388 --> 27:08.118
I was a corporate
vice president.

27:09.592 --> 27:11.958
Mr. Bergman.

27:39.388 --> 27:41.356
<i>President Assad of Syria said...</i>

27:41.424 --> 27:44.587
<i>that difficult obstacles remain,</i>
<i>but that his country,</i>

27:44.660 --> 27:49.097
"looks forward to a great long peace
with Israel."

27:49.165 --> 27:51.656
That's a Peabody, Mike.

27:51.734 --> 27:54.828
When you're dead and buried, this is
the one they're gonna remember you by.

27:57.039 --> 27:59.303
- Are you eating with us?
- Yeah.

27:59.375 --> 28:03.106
- Bring a tie so they let us
in the front door.

28:03.179 --> 28:05.272
Come on.

28:12.521 --> 28:15.183
- Debbie!
<i>- Hey, Lowell.</i>

28:15.257 --> 28:18.055
Oh, Bill. Main Justice is investigating
a major New York bank...

28:18.127 --> 28:20.595
laundering narco dollars
out of their Mexico City branch.

28:20.663 --> 28:22.722
- You want it for the news?
- What about you? You got a crew already?

28:22.798 --> 28:25.790
- I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Catch you later.
- Okay.

28:30.873 --> 28:32.807
- Debbie.
- How are you?

28:32.875 --> 28:36.311
I want you to get Legal on a corporate
confidentiality agreement.

28:36.378 --> 28:38.778
- Okay.
- Boundaries of their constraint,

28:38.848 --> 28:41.783
Kentucky state law about...

28:41.851 --> 28:43.785
<i>- I want you to drop everything.</i>
- Okay.

28:43.853 --> 28:46.185
- I don't have any change.
You got some change?
<i>- Oh, here.</i>

28:55.097 --> 28:57.088
Tony.

29:12.381 --> 29:15.111
<i>Mr. Wigand? You can go up now.</i>

29:37.839 --> 29:40.103
Sorry. I'm accepting
an award...

29:40.174 --> 29:43.940
from the Retinitis
Pigmentosa Foundation.

29:44.012 --> 29:46.378
It's gonna kill
the rest of my day.

29:52.020 --> 29:56.150
So, have you had a chance
to play golf?

29:56.224 --> 30:00.058
Jeff's a premier golfer.
What are you, a two handicap?

30:00.128 --> 30:03.359
- Seven.
- And he gets out there...

30:03.431 --> 30:06.093
and he has
five strokes on us.

30:06.167 --> 30:09.432
He has more concentration
than anybody I've ever met.

30:09.504 --> 30:12.962
It's spooky
how he can concentrate.

30:15.910 --> 30:18.174
I'd rather play
than talk about it.

30:19.781 --> 30:22.477
What did you
want to see me about?

30:22.550 --> 30:24.484
I don't like
being back here.

30:24.552 --> 30:27.316
Jeffrey says exactly
what's on his mind.

30:27.388 --> 30:30.323
Most people consider
what they're saying... social skills.

30:30.391 --> 30:33.326
Jeffrey just charges
right ahead.

30:33.394 --> 30:38.388
Now, I know you understood the nature
of the confidentiality portion...

30:38.466 --> 30:41.333
of your severance agreement
with Brown & Williamson.

30:41.402 --> 30:44.337
- Chapter and verse.
- Yeah, I know you do.

30:44.405 --> 30:48.364
You know, I came up
through sales.

30:48.443 --> 30:50.809
One of the reasons
I was a great salesman...

30:50.878 --> 30:53.938
was I never made a promise
I couldn't keep.

30:54.015 --> 30:56.745
I knew that if I ever
broke my promise,

30:56.818 --> 30:59.514
I'd suffer
the consequence.

30:59.587 --> 31:01.452
Is that a threat?

31:02.757 --> 31:06.158
We worked together for...
what was it, three years?

31:06.227 --> 31:09.162
Now, the work we did here is
confidential, not for public scrutiny...

31:09.230 --> 31:11.357
any more than
are one's family matters.

31:11.432 --> 31:13.696
You're threatening
my family now too?

31:13.768 --> 31:17.397
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.

31:17.472 --> 31:20.930
About the direction of research here,
we may have had our differences, but...

31:21.008 --> 31:25.707
Research. You declare
as a badge of honor you don't
even know what makes water boil.

31:25.780 --> 31:28.271
Well, that's why
we hire scientists.

31:28.349 --> 31:31.648
Okay.

31:31.719 --> 31:34.552
I don't believe that you can
maintain corporate integrity...

31:34.622 --> 31:37.420
without
confidentiality agreements.

31:37.492 --> 31:39.517
I was paid well
for my work,

31:39.594 --> 31:42.620
the health and welfare
benefits are good,

31:42.697 --> 31:45.063
the severance package
is fair.

31:45.133 --> 31:49.092
I have no intention of violating
my confidentiality agreement...

31:49.170 --> 31:52.799
<i>and disclosing that</i>
<i>which I said I wouldn't.</i>

31:54.242 --> 31:56.676
I appreciate
all that, Jeff,

31:56.744 --> 32:02.307
but upon reflection, we've decided
to expand our zone of comfort with you,

32:02.383 --> 32:05.477
so we've drafted a supplement
to your agreement.

32:06.854 --> 32:10.187
<i>It broadly defines and</i>
<i>expands in more detail...</i>

32:10.258 --> 32:12.226
what is confidential.

32:12.293 --> 32:16.059
Nobody will be able
to say, "Well, hell's bells, Margaret,

32:16.130 --> 32:18.690
I didn't know <i>that</i>
was a secret."

32:18.766 --> 32:22.031
We're very serious
about protecting our interests.

32:22.103 --> 32:24.867
We'd like you
to sign it.

32:26.407 --> 32:28.568
And if I don't?

32:28.643 --> 32:32.101
If we arrive at the conclusion
that you're acting in bad faith,

32:32.180 --> 32:36.116
we would terminate right now
payoffs under your severance package,

32:36.184 --> 32:41.315
you and your family's medical
benefits and initiate litigation
against you, Mr. Wigand.

32:42.790 --> 32:46.726
<i>- Dr.</i> Wigand.
<i>- Dr. Wigand.</i>

32:46.794 --> 32:50.457
<i>If you've examined the document, you'll</i>
<i>see it's in your own best interest...</i>

32:50.531 --> 32:52.658
and you'll sign it.

32:58.439 --> 33:02.933
What you're saying is it isn't enough
that you fired me for no good reason.

33:03.010 --> 33:05.035
Now you question
my integrity?

33:05.112 --> 33:09.776
On top of the humiliation
of being fired, you threaten me,

33:09.851 --> 33:13.184
you threaten
my family.

33:13.254 --> 33:16.382
It never crossed my mind
not to honor my agreement.

33:16.457 --> 33:19.426
I will tell you, Mr. Sandefur...
and Brown & Williamson too...

33:19.494 --> 33:22.691
Fuck me?
Well, fuck you!

33:32.540 --> 33:35.703
I'm not sure
he got the message.

33:35.776 --> 33:38.506
Oh, I think he did.

33:50.958 --> 33:52.721
- Yeah.
- You fucked me!

33:53.961 --> 33:56.521
- Who's this?
- Protect your sources?

33:56.597 --> 33:58.531
You screwed me.
You sold me out.

34:00.401 --> 34:05.073
- What are you talking about?
Where are you?
- Fuck you too!

37:27.875 --> 37:30.173
Stay away from me.

37:31.545 --> 37:33.945
You stay away from me!

37:42.123 --> 37:45.058
Jeffrey, you forgot
the lunches!

37:51.265 --> 37:53.529
<i>- Mrs. Wigand?</i>
- Jump in quick. Come on.

37:53.601 --> 37:57.162
How do you do? I'm Lowell Bergman.
We spoke on the phone.

37:59.273 --> 38:02.299
- Come here. I want to talk to you.
- Good. I want to talk to you.

38:02.376 --> 38:05.277
- This is my house.
In front of my wife, my kids?
- I did not burn you.

38:05.346 --> 38:07.541
I did not give you up
to anyone.

38:07.615 --> 38:10.778
- What business do we have?
- I'm here to straighten
something out with you.

38:10.851 --> 38:12.819
Right here, right now.

38:12.887 --> 38:15.515
You haven't mentioned my name?
You haven't talked to anybody about me?

38:15.589 --> 38:17.022
- What am I gonna mention your name for?
- Why are Brown & Williamson...

38:17.091 --> 38:19.025
How the hell do I know about
Brown & Williamson?

38:19.093 --> 38:22.551
It happened just after I talked to you.
I do not like coincidences.

38:22.630 --> 38:25.565
Well, I don't like paranoid accusations.
I'm a journalist.

38:25.633 --> 38:29.763
Think. Use your head.
How do I operate as a journalist?
By screwing the people...

38:29.837 --> 38:34.069
who could provide me with information
before they provided me with it?

38:34.141 --> 38:37.508
- You came all the way
down here to tell me that?
- No, I did not.

38:37.578 --> 38:39.637
Big Tobacco
is a big story,

38:39.714 --> 38:42.080
and you got something
important to say. I can tell.

38:42.149 --> 38:45.710
But yes, I did. I came all
the way down here to tell you...

38:45.786 --> 38:48.846
Story, no story...
fuck your story.

38:50.424 --> 38:53.222
I don't burn people.

39:24.158 --> 39:26.888
Ride with me while I
take the girls to school.

39:55.856 --> 39:58.086
<i>My little girl has acute asthma.</i>

39:58.159 --> 40:01.856
Deborah, my oldest daughter.

40:01.929 --> 40:05.296
And I'm unemployed, so I have
to protect my medical coverage.

40:07.468 --> 40:11.427
So I left them a message
this morning. Their expanded
confidentiality agreement...

40:13.574 --> 40:16.270
I will sign it.

40:16.343 --> 40:19.107
- They're afraid of you, aren't they?
- They should be.

40:25.886 --> 40:28.719
Talk to me outside the zone
of your agreement.

40:28.789 --> 40:32.850
- Like what?
- Like, uh, where'd you work
before Brown & Williamson?

40:32.927 --> 40:35.225
Johnson &Johnson.

40:35.296 --> 40:37.321
Union Carbide in Japan.

40:37.398 --> 40:40.856
I was the general manager and director
of new products. I speak Japanese.

40:40.935 --> 40:45.269
I was a director
of corporate development at Pfizer.

40:45.339 --> 40:47.967
All health-related.

40:50.444 --> 40:52.435
What else
outside the zone?

40:54.782 --> 40:57.376
I don't know. Do you think the Knicks
are gonna make it to the semifinals?

41:10.630 --> 41:12.461
- Just give me an example.
- Okay.

41:12.532 --> 41:15.399
For example, um,
James Burke.

41:15.468 --> 41:17.561
- C.E.O. Of Johnson &Johnson.
- Yeah.

41:17.637 --> 41:22.472
When he found out that some lunatic
had put poison in Tylenol bottles,

41:22.542 --> 41:24.476
he didn't argue
with the F.D.A.

41:24.544 --> 41:27.206
He didn't even wait for the F.D.A.
To tell him. He just pulled Tylenol...

41:27.280 --> 41:31.649
off every shelf of every store
right across America, instantly.

41:31.718 --> 41:34.881
And then he developed a safety cap.

41:34.954 --> 41:39.550
Because as a C.E.O., sure, he's
gotta be a great businessman, right?

41:39.626 --> 41:42.060
But he's also
a man of science.

41:42.128 --> 41:47.430
He's not gonna allow his company
to put on the shelf a product
that might hurt people.

41:47.500 --> 41:49.593
Not like
the Seven Dwarfs.

41:49.669 --> 41:52.433
- Seven Dwarfs?
- Seven C.E.O. S of Big Tobacco.

41:52.505 --> 41:54.598
They got in front of Congress
that time. It was on television.

41:54.674 --> 41:57.370
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Swore under oath that
they know nothing about addiction...

41:57.443 --> 41:59.434
It was on C-SPAN.
Yeah.

41:59.512 --> 42:04.609
Okay, so, here you are.
You-You-You go to work for tobacco.

42:04.684 --> 42:07.585
You come from corporate cultures
where research...

42:07.654 --> 42:10.316
really creative thinking...
these are core values.

42:10.390 --> 42:13.757
You go to tobacco.
Tobacco is a sales culture...

42:13.826 --> 42:16.886
market and sell enormous volume,
go to a lot of golf tournaments.

42:16.963 --> 42:19.227
The hell with everything else.
What are you doing?

42:19.299 --> 42:22.029
- Why are you working
for tobacco in the first place?
- I can't talk about it.

42:22.101 --> 42:24.831
The work I was supposed to do...

42:24.904 --> 42:27.964
might have had some positive effect,
I don't know.

42:28.041 --> 42:32.740
Could have been beneficial.
Mostly, I got paid a lot.

42:32.812 --> 42:36.077
I took the money.
My wife was happy.

42:36.149 --> 42:39.414
My kids had good medical,
good schools. Got a great house.

42:39.485 --> 42:41.715
I mean, what the hell
is wrong with that?

42:41.788 --> 42:44.348
Nothing's wrong with that. That's it.
You're making money.

42:44.424 --> 42:47.086
You're providing for your family.
What could be wrong with that?

42:50.163 --> 42:53.929
I always thought of myself as a man of
science, that's what's wrong with it.

42:55.935 --> 42:59.029
Then you're in
a state of conflict, Jeff.

42:59.105 --> 43:01.801
Because look,
here's how it lays out.

43:01.874 --> 43:03.842
If you've got vital
insider stuff,

43:03.910 --> 43:06.572
the American people, for their
welfare, really do need to know,

43:06.646 --> 43:08.614
and you feel impelled
to disclose it...

43:08.681 --> 43:11.878
and violate your agreement
in doing so, that's one thing.

43:11.951 --> 43:15.853
On the other hand, if you want
to honor this agreement,

43:15.922 --> 43:18.186
then that's simple...
you do so.

43:18.257 --> 43:20.452
You say nothing,
you do nothing.

43:20.526 --> 43:23.757
There's only one guy
who can figure that out for you,

43:23.830 --> 43:26.663
and that's you
all by yourself.

43:32.805 --> 43:34.932
I gotta go pick up the girls.
They only had a half a day.

43:54.360 --> 43:57.056
<i> I've heard virtually</i>
<i>all the... We touched on it...</i>

43:57.130 --> 44:00.861
<i>- Yes or no, do you believe</i>
<i>nicotine is not addictive?</i>
<i>- Congressman,</i>

44:00.933 --> 44:06.132
<i>cigarettes and nicotine clearly</i>
<i>do not meet the classic</i>
<i>definitions of addiction.</i>

44:06.205 --> 44:08.867
- There is no intoxication.
- We'll take that as no.

44:08.941 --> 44:10.932
Again, time is short.

44:11.010 --> 44:13.570
I think each of you believe
nicotine is not addictive...

44:13.646 --> 44:16.012
<i>and just would like to</i>
<i>have this for the record.</i>

44:16.082 --> 44:20.143
I believe that nicotine
is not addictive.

44:20.219 --> 44:22.619
I too believe
that nicotine...

44:22.689 --> 44:25.715
<i>He referred to this...</i>
<i>the Seven Dwarfs...</i>

44:25.792 --> 44:28.784
- What Seven Dwarfs?
<i>- The seven C.E.O. Of Big Tobacco...</i>
<i>referred to this.</i>

44:28.861 --> 44:32.888
Said they should be afraid of him.
I assume afraid of what he could reveal.

44:32.965 --> 44:37.834
Now you tell me. What does this guy
have to say that threatens these people?

44:37.904 --> 44:40.065
Well, it isn't cigarettes
are bad for you.

44:40.139 --> 44:42.403
- Hardly new news.
- No shit.

44:44.043 --> 44:48.571
- What's this?
<i>- What that is is tobacco's</i>
<i>standard defense.</i>

44:48.648 --> 44:50.582
It's the "we don't know"
litany.

44:50.650 --> 44:54.484
Addiction? We believe not.
Disease? We don't know.

44:54.554 --> 44:57.387
We take a bunch of leaves,
we roll them together, you smoke 'em.

44:57.457 --> 45:00.790
After that, you're on your own.
We don't know.

45:00.860 --> 45:02.919
<i>So, that</i>
<i>tells me nothing.</i>

45:02.995 --> 45:06.226
- Besides, you'll never get
what he's got.
- Why not?

45:06.299 --> 45:08.358
<i>Because of this guy's</i>
<i>confidentiality agreement,</i>

45:08.434 --> 45:10.800
he's never gonna be able
to talk to you.

45:10.870 --> 45:13.498
That's not good enough.
This guy is the top scientist...

45:13.573 --> 45:16.041
in the number-three
tobacco company in America.

45:16.109 --> 45:20.068
He's a corporate officer.
You never get whistle-blowers
from Fortune 500 companies.

45:20.146 --> 45:22.842
This guy is
the ultimate insider.

45:22.915 --> 45:25.941
He's got something to say. He wants
to say it. I want it on <i>60 Minutes.</i>

45:26.018 --> 45:28.145
Doesn't matter what he wants.
<i>Am I missing something here?</i>

45:28.221 --> 45:31.486
- What do you mean, Mike?
- He's got a corporate secrecy agreement.

45:31.557 --> 45:33.787
Give me a break.

45:33.860 --> 45:37.694
This is a public health issue, like an
unsafe air frame on a passenger jet...

45:37.764 --> 45:40.562
or some company dumping cyanide
into the East River.

45:40.633 --> 45:43.329
Issues like that.
He can talk, we can air it.

45:43.402 --> 45:46.929
They've got no right to hide behind
a corporate agreement. Pass the milk.

45:47.006 --> 45:49.668
They don't need the right.
They got the money.

45:49.742 --> 45:53.109
The unlimited checkbook.
That's how Big Tobacco wins...

45:53.179 --> 45:55.170
every time
on everything.

45:55.248 --> 46:00.413
They spend you to death.
$600 million a year in outside legal.

46:00.486 --> 46:04.422
Chadbourne-Park, Ken Starr's firm,
Kirkland and Ellis.

46:04.490 --> 46:07.186
Listen, G.M. And Ford,
they get nailed...

46:07.260 --> 46:10.252
after 11 or 12 pickups
blow up, right?

46:10.329 --> 46:13.526
- These clowns have never... I mean ever...
<i>- Not even once.</i>

46:13.599 --> 46:17.091
Not even with hundreds of thousands
dying each year from an illness...

46:17.170 --> 46:20.833
<i>related to their product have ever</i>
<i>lost a personal injury lawsuit.</i>

46:20.907 --> 46:24.308
On this case, they'll issue gag orders,
sue for breach... anticipatory breach...

46:24.377 --> 46:29.144
enjoin him, you, us,
his pet dog, the dog's veterinarian,

46:29.215 --> 46:32.651
tie 'em up in litigation for ten
or 15 years, I'm telling you,
they bat a thousand.

46:32.718 --> 46:36.449
Every time. He knows that.
That's why he's not gonna talk to you.

46:43.529 --> 46:47.397
<i>Okay, let's look through</i>
<i>the looking glass the other way.</i>

46:47.466 --> 46:50.060
What do you mean?

46:50.136 --> 46:52.502
We got a guy who wants to talk,
but he's constrained.

46:52.572 --> 46:55.735
- What if he were compelled to talk?
- Oh, torture. Great ratings.

46:55.808 --> 46:57.969
What do you mean, "compelled"?

46:58.044 --> 47:01.207
I mean, compelled
by a, uh, Justice Department.

47:01.280 --> 47:03.441
State courts.
Be a witness.

47:03.516 --> 47:06.747
That would cut through any
confidentiality agreement, wouldn't it?

47:06.819 --> 47:09.185
- What does that do?
- What do you mean, what does it do?

47:09.255 --> 47:12.588
What I mean is like, how does it cut
through the confidentiality agreement?

47:12.658 --> 47:15.491
Because he has to, uh,
reveal it in a court of law.

47:15.561 --> 47:18.325
It's on record. It's out.
It's no secret anymore.

47:18.397 --> 47:22.231
So how can they restrain his speech
or retaliate? It's out in the world.

47:22.301 --> 47:24.929
If you could engineer it into the
court record, you might have something.

47:25.004 --> 47:28.030
They would have a hell of a time
trying to restrain his speech
then, wouldn't they?

47:28.107 --> 47:31.873
Yeah, but what venue? And where does
he get... Does he have killer attorneys?

47:31.944 --> 47:34.845
I don't think he's got
any attorneys.

47:34.914 --> 47:38.475
<i>He's gonna need attorneys who aren't</i>
<i>afraid of risking years of litigation...</i>

47:38.551 --> 47:42.885
and millions of dollars
of their own dough in legal costs.

47:42.955 --> 47:45.446
What do you say, Mike?
What do you think?

47:48.060 --> 47:50.551
Even if he gets
the defense team,

47:55.067 --> 47:57.627
will he go for it?

48:03.743 --> 48:06.871
You're awfully
overqualified, Dr. Wigand.

48:13.619 --> 48:16.053
I'm trying to start
a new career.

48:17.957 --> 48:20.016
I believe I could be
a good teacher.

48:24.864 --> 48:26.798
Let me give it
some thought.

48:31.337 --> 48:35.569
And not a lot of companies in the health
care field hire ex-tobacco scientists.

49:09.841 --> 49:11.775
That's it.

49:20.085 --> 49:23.020
It's where
our babies were born.

49:26.791 --> 49:29.157
Debbie took her first steps
right there on...

49:31.263 --> 49:33.197
In the grass.

49:36.268 --> 49:39.863
- I didn't plan on this.
- Hey, hey, hey.

49:39.938 --> 49:42.031
Come on. Come on.

49:46.077 --> 49:50.241
We can make this
work for us. Okay?

49:50.315 --> 49:52.249
It's just...
It's not...

49:52.317 --> 49:55.150
It's just...
It's a smaller scale.

49:55.220 --> 49:59.122
Simpler, easier.

49:59.190 --> 50:03.422
More time.
More time together.

50:03.495 --> 50:05.759
More time
with the kids.

50:05.830 --> 50:08.663
More time for us.
Okay? It's just...

50:11.503 --> 50:15.166
Can you imagine me
coming home from some job...

50:15.240 --> 50:17.401
feeling good
at the end of the day?

50:19.878 --> 50:21.812
This is gonna be better.

50:24.516 --> 50:26.814
This is gonna be better.

50:45.503 --> 50:48.267
<i> Love your home</i>

51:32.250 --> 51:34.684
Hey, baby.
What's wrong?

51:34.753 --> 51:36.880
Who's that outside,
Daddy?

51:39.090 --> 51:41.854
- Did you see somebody
or did you hear them?
- I heard him.

51:43.495 --> 51:46.089
- Where?
- In the backyard.

52:03.014 --> 52:05.881
Sit at Daddy's desk, okay?
Why don't you sit up at the desk.

52:05.950 --> 52:07.884
All right?

52:07.952 --> 52:12.048
Get out some paper,
and draw me a picture. Okay?

52:17.595 --> 52:21.725
What are you gonna draw me, baby?
An animal? Something like that?

52:21.800 --> 52:24.963
You stay down here until Daddy
gets back, all right, Barbara?

52:25.036 --> 52:26.970
You stay down here.

53:24.329 --> 53:26.661
You almost got
your damn head blown off.

54:06.504 --> 54:08.438
Daddy!

54:09.541 --> 54:13.341
It was just a raccoon, baby.
Nothin'.

54:13.411 --> 54:15.902
They're nocturnal.
You know what that means?

54:15.980 --> 54:18.414
That means that they
only come out at nighttime.

54:31.496 --> 54:33.513
- Yeah.
- Lowell. Jeffrey Wigand.

54:33.548 --> 54:35.530
- Yeah.
- Lowell. Jeffrey Wigand.

54:35.599 --> 54:38.898
<i>Is it too late?</i>

54:38.969 --> 54:41.062
No, no, it's okay. I...

54:41.138 --> 54:43.072
How-How's the new place?

54:43.140 --> 54:45.540
The new place?
New.

54:45.609 --> 54:49.045
- You okay?
- Sure.

54:49.113 --> 54:52.549
I was thinking of
calling you tomorrow anyway.

54:52.616 --> 54:57.280
- Uh, how's your kids,
uh, handling the new house?
- Good.

54:57.354 --> 55:00.585
- You got kids?
- We have a couple.

55:00.658 --> 55:04.617
One's hers, one's mine.
Everybody uses a different name.

55:04.695 --> 55:06.629
Modern marriage.

55:06.697 --> 55:08.892
Uh, how's Liane?

55:10.634 --> 55:13.933
Uh, she's okay. Uh...

55:14.004 --> 55:15.938
Hold on a minute.

55:22.680 --> 55:25.114
Lowell.

55:25.182 --> 55:28.379
Somebody may be following me. I-I don't
know. They came on the property.

55:28.452 --> 55:31.717
What do you mean, following you?
Did you call the police?

55:31.789 --> 55:34.781
I-I don't wanna be paranoid.
I mean...

55:34.859 --> 55:38.556
- Maybe it's a game.
Some kind of mind game.
- What do you really think?

55:38.629 --> 55:40.563
I don't know what the fuck
I really think.

55:40.631 --> 55:43.623
Are they doing it?
Is some crank doing it?

55:43.701 --> 55:45.635
Are they doing it
to make me feel paranoid?

55:45.703 --> 55:48.604
Are they doing it for real and don't
give a shit what I think? I don't know.

55:48.672 --> 55:51.573
- I don't fuckin' know.
- Jeffrey, describe for me...

55:51.642 --> 55:53.610
in detail what happened.

55:53.677 --> 55:55.702
Well...

55:55.780 --> 55:59.341
No. Look, I mean, there was
a footprint. Forget it.

55:59.416 --> 56:01.907
It's probably
not important at all.

56:01.986 --> 56:06.855
You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching
high school. Japanese and Chemistry.

56:08.893 --> 56:12.090
Uh, so, uh, what were you
calling about?

56:12.163 --> 56:15.621
- You called me.
- No, you said you were gonna
call me tomorrow.

56:15.699 --> 56:18.497
- So, what about?
- Oh, yes, yes, yes. I did.
I wanted to talk to you.

56:18.569 --> 56:23.302
I wanted to hook up with you,
talk to you about what we were
talking about in your car.

56:25.442 --> 56:27.376
Okay.

56:27.444 --> 56:30.971
It makes you feel good,
putting what you know to use?

56:33.551 --> 56:36.452
- How'd you know that, Lowell?
- It's obvious, isn't it?

56:39.590 --> 56:41.922
Hello?
Are you there?

56:41.992 --> 56:44.460
Yeah.

56:44.528 --> 56:47.053
Look, um...

56:47.131 --> 56:49.395
Thanks for talking.
I'm sorry I woke you up.

56:49.466 --> 56:53.061
- I didn't know.
- It's okay.

57:01.579 --> 57:05.413
Lowell.

57:05.482 --> 57:07.416
Who is this?

57:07.484 --> 57:10.078
<i>Do not call here!</i>
<i>Do not...</i>

57:34.712 --> 57:36.646
What are you
gonna get us?

57:36.714 --> 57:38.705
Tempura.

57:42.586 --> 57:45.077
The Internet said you did
graduate work at Wisconsin,

57:45.155 --> 57:48.647
then went to U.C. La Jolla
with Professor Herbert?

57:48.726 --> 57:51.126
- Marcus...
- Marcuse. Yeah.

57:51.195 --> 57:53.493
He was my mentor.

57:53.564 --> 57:56.727
He had a major influence
on the New Left in the late '60s.

57:56.800 --> 57:58.825
And on me, personally.

57:58.903 --> 58:01.428
- Next to your father?
- My father?

58:01.505 --> 58:04.099
What the hell's that got
to do with my father?

58:06.277 --> 58:08.370
I, uh...

58:08.445 --> 58:12.404
Is that why you became a journalist?
Then you get to ask all the questions?

58:12.483 --> 58:15.850
You charge by the hour?

58:15.920 --> 58:18.821
My father was a...
A mechanical engineer.

58:18.889 --> 58:20.823
Most ingenious man
I ever knew.

58:20.891 --> 58:22.916
My father left us
when I was five years old.

58:22.993 --> 58:24.927
He was not the most ingenious man
I ever knew.

58:24.995 --> 58:29.591
Let's get back to Brown & Williamson.
If you decide to go on <i>60 Minutes,</i>

58:29.667 --> 58:32.932
I gotta know everything
about why you were fired.

58:33.003 --> 58:37.167
- Why?
- They're gonna dig up
stuff from your past.

58:37.241 --> 58:40.802
They're gonna throw it at you.
I gotta know what they're gonna throw.

58:40.878 --> 58:42.812
You understand?

58:45.449 --> 58:47.383
I drink.

58:47.451 --> 58:50.147
- Couple of occasions
more than I should have.
- Um-hmm.

58:53.757 --> 58:57.090
I was cited for shoplifting
once, but it was a mistake.

58:59.763 --> 59:02.732
Pushed Liane one time. We were both
stressed out because of the pressure.

59:02.800 --> 59:05.462
She went to her mother's.

59:05.536 --> 59:08.505
I got, uh, fired,
because, uh,

59:08.572 --> 59:11.405
when I get angry, I have
difficulty censoring myself,

59:11.475 --> 59:14.342
and I don't like
to be pushed around.

59:14.411 --> 59:17.869
I'm not pushing you around.
I'm asking you questions.

59:20.384 --> 59:22.944
I'm just a commodity
to you, aren't I?

59:23.020 --> 59:26.387
I could be anything, right? Anything
worth putting on between commercials.

59:26.457 --> 59:28.857
To a network, probably,
we're all commodities.

59:28.926 --> 59:31.394
To me, you're not a commodity.
What you are is important.

59:33.297 --> 59:36.733
You go public, and 30 million people
hear what you gotta say,

59:36.800 --> 59:40.361
nothing... I mean nothing...
will ever be the same again.

59:40.437 --> 59:42.632
- You believe that?
- No.

59:42.706 --> 59:45.470
You should. Because when
you're done the judgment...

59:45.542 --> 59:49.535
is gonna go down in the court
of public opinion, my friend.

59:49.613 --> 59:52.207
And that's...
the power you have.

59:52.282 --> 59:55.547
- You believe that?
- I believe that?

59:55.619 --> 59:57.553
- Yes, I believe that.
- You believe that...

59:57.621 --> 01:00:00.351
- because you get information out
to people, something happens?
- Yes.

01:00:00.424 --> 01:00:03.291
Maybe that's just what you've been
telling yourself all these years...

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.294
to justify having a good job.

01:00:05.362 --> 01:00:07.330
Having status.

01:00:07.398 --> 01:00:10.424
Maybe for the audience
it's just voyeurism, something
to do on a Sunday night.

01:00:10.501 --> 01:00:12.492
Maybe it won't
change a fuckin' thing,

01:00:12.569 --> 01:00:15.060
and people like myself
and my family...

01:00:15.139 --> 01:00:19.269
are left hung out to dry,
used up, broke, alone.

01:00:19.343 --> 01:00:22.335
Are you talking to me, or did somebody
else just walk in here? I never...

01:00:24.281 --> 01:00:28.115
Don't evade a choice you gotta make
by questioning my reputation...

01:00:28.185 --> 01:00:30.585
or <i>60 Minutes</i>
with this cheap skepticism.

01:00:30.654 --> 01:00:33.589
I have to put my family's welfare
on the line here, my friend.

01:00:33.657 --> 01:00:36.285
- What are you putting up?
You're putting up words.
- "Words."

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:39.591
While you've been dicking around some
fucking company golf tournaments,

01:00:39.663 --> 01:00:42.530
I've been out in the world
givin' my word...

01:00:42.599 --> 01:00:45.124
and backing it up
with action.

01:00:49.273 --> 01:00:51.935
Now, are you gonna go
and do this thing or not?

01:00:54.678 --> 01:00:56.976
I said I'd call the kids
before they went to bed.

01:01:09.993 --> 01:01:13.952
<i>Stringer was supposed to be shooting</i>
<i>B- roll on street cops in New Orleans.</i>

01:01:14.031 --> 01:01:17.401
<i>- What's with all the horses?</i>
<i>- Camera guy's got</i>
<i>a thing about mounted police.</i>

01:01:17.534 --> 01:01:21.061
Don't any of these guys
ride in cars? Walk?

01:01:21.138 --> 01:01:23.402
- How long are these things?
- What was he saying?

01:01:23.473 --> 01:01:25.941
Hello. Yes, I'm trying
to reach Mr. Richard Scruggs.

01:01:26.009 --> 01:01:28.443
This is Richard Scruggs.

01:01:28.512 --> 01:01:30.446
Can you hold on
a second, please?

01:01:30.514 --> 01:01:32.846
Lowell, got him
on the phone.

01:01:36.219 --> 01:01:39.279
- Hello, I'm Lowell Bergman.
- Hold on.

01:01:39.356 --> 01:01:43.122
Mobile Approach, this is
Leo-November-643. Over.

01:01:45.762 --> 01:01:47.787
Request a flight level
of 220...

01:01:47.864 --> 01:01:50.458
on a heading
of 284 degrees. Over.

01:01:52.269 --> 01:01:54.294
- Mr. Bergman?
- Yes, I'm right here.

01:01:54.371 --> 01:01:57.067
- Could you call me back on a hard line?
- All right.

01:01:57.140 --> 01:02:02.703
- Area code 212-555-0199.
<i>- I'll call you then.</i>

01:02:08.752 --> 01:02:11.516
<i>What do we do with that?</i>

01:02:11.588 --> 01:02:14.056
I don't know.

01:02:14.124 --> 01:02:16.058
Richard Scruggs.

01:02:16.126 --> 01:02:19.357
You filed a lawsuit against tobacco
on behalf of the state of Mississippi.

01:02:19.429 --> 01:02:21.363
<i>- Did you not?</i>
- That's right.

01:02:21.431 --> 01:02:25.993
<i>I'm working with someone now</i>
<i>who's the former head of</i>
<i>research at Brown & Williamson.</i>

01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:28.663
<i>Former corporate officer there.</i>

01:02:28.738 --> 01:02:30.706
What's your interest
in this, Mr. Bergman?

01:02:30.774 --> 01:02:33.072
Well, he may tape
an interview with us,

01:02:33.143 --> 01:02:36.476
and we believe if his testimony
showed up in a court record first,

01:02:36.546 --> 01:02:40.573
<i>it would free him up from his</i>
<i>confidentiality agreement</i>
<i>and give him some protection.</i>

01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:43.642
It could work. If it's public record,
it's public record.

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:46.018
<i>Yeah, and he's gonna need</i>
<i>legal representation.</i>

01:02:46.089 --> 01:02:48.353
He sure as hell will.

01:02:48.425 --> 01:02:51.155
Has he decided
to go public?

01:02:51.228 --> 01:02:53.924
Because let me tell ya.
We been doin' this for three years now,

01:02:53.997 --> 01:02:57.558
and we've worked with a lot of corporate
cases involving whistle-blowers.

01:02:57.634 --> 01:03:00.899
So we know Big Tobacco will do
everything in their power to stop him.

01:03:00.971 --> 01:03:04.031
So is your man
truly committed?

01:03:04.107 --> 01:03:07.440
Well, actually, no... Well, he's
on the fence. That's the point.

01:03:10.146 --> 01:03:13.547
Well, we'd certainly be interested
in making his acquaintance.

01:03:13.617 --> 01:03:16.108
But without knowing
what he's gonna do...

01:03:16.186 --> 01:03:19.553
Would you want him to call you, or you
wanna call him? How do you wanna do it?

01:03:19.623 --> 01:03:22.490
It would be better
if he called us.

01:03:22.559 --> 01:03:24.550
- Yeah. Okay.
- All right?

01:03:24.628 --> 01:03:26.858
Okay. Thank you.
Shit.

01:03:31.101 --> 01:03:33.626
We need cops on the streets.
We don't need them on horses.

01:03:33.703 --> 01:03:35.603
- I don't know what he was thinking.
- For God's sake.

01:03:35.672 --> 01:03:37.731
- This guy got a horse fetish?
- All right, all right.

01:03:37.807 --> 01:03:39.968
Get me, uh...
Get me to New Orleans this afternoon.

01:03:40.043 --> 01:03:42.273
I'll shoot
the fucking thing myself!

01:03:43.713 --> 01:03:45.647
- Have a good one.
<i>- All right.</i>

01:04:06.469 --> 01:04:08.403
<i>What are you cooking?</i>

01:04:08.471 --> 01:04:12.339
- I'm cooking pasta primavera.
<i>- Oh, I love that stuff.</i>

01:04:15.979 --> 01:04:17.913
I'm going to
have to go downstairs.

01:04:49.879 --> 01:04:51.608
Jeffrey!

01:05:13.770 --> 01:05:15.829
<i>Jeffrey! Jeffrey!</i>

01:05:15.905 --> 01:05:19.204
<i>Jeffrey! Jeffrey!</i>

01:05:47.404 --> 01:05:51.340
<i>- What happened?</i>
<i>- Dispatcher received a call</i>
<i>of shots fired in the area.</i>

01:05:51.408 --> 01:05:56.072
Uniforms arrived on the scene, found
this white male subject shot to death.

01:05:56.146 --> 01:05:59.411
- Was it gang related?
- There's no indication...

01:05:59.482 --> 01:06:04.351
as far as a tag or an advertisement.

01:06:04.421 --> 01:06:06.946
Yeah.

01:06:08.425 --> 01:06:11.121
They're terrorizing us.
Death threats. My family, my kids.

01:06:11.194 --> 01:06:13.128
Whoa. What are you
talking about?

01:06:13.196 --> 01:06:16.688
- Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
- Jeff, call the F.B.I.

01:06:16.766 --> 01:06:19.030
- Right away.
- They do this with impunity.

01:06:19.102 --> 01:06:21.570
- Jeff...
- They get to go home at night.

01:06:21.638 --> 01:06:24.300
What does it cost these people
to do this to us? Nothing!

01:06:26.342 --> 01:06:28.902
My girls are crying.
So fuck them.

01:06:28.978 --> 01:06:31.071
- I wanna tape. I'm done...
- I heard you.

01:06:31.147 --> 01:06:33.638
I gotta arrange
for a legal defense first.

01:06:33.717 --> 01:06:36.811
I gotta get you to testify in court,
get it on public record.

01:06:36.886 --> 01:06:39.684
Then hold it off the air until you
got that, but I wanna go to New York,

01:06:39.756 --> 01:06:43.089
and I wanna go on the record...
right now.

01:06:43.159 --> 01:06:47.391
- Good. But, Jeff...
- I'll call them, Lowell.

01:06:51.835 --> 01:06:55.635
Did you handle the round,
Mr. Wigand?

01:06:55.705 --> 01:06:57.639
Yes, I'm afraid I did.

01:06:57.707 --> 01:07:00.301
We won't be able to lift
usable prints.

01:07:02.245 --> 01:07:04.805
Do you own a gun,
Mr. Wigand?

01:07:06.015 --> 01:07:08.575
- A gun? Yes.
- What caliber is your gun?

01:07:10.053 --> 01:07:11.987
What caliber is <i>my</i> gun?

01:07:12.055 --> 01:07:14.990
Yes, sir.
What caliber is your gun?

01:07:15.058 --> 01:07:17.925
What does that have to do
with the price of tea in China?

01:07:20.897 --> 01:07:24.628
You think I put the bullet
in the mailbox myself?

01:07:24.701 --> 01:07:27.261
If we could
take a look, Mr. Wigand.

01:07:40.517 --> 01:07:42.451
Why do you keep this gun?

01:07:42.519 --> 01:07:46.011
I don't think it's unconstitutional
yet to own a gun. I'm a target shooter.

01:07:46.089 --> 01:07:49.183
That bullet was for a.38 caliber.
Do you own a.38?

01:07:49.259 --> 01:07:52.285
<i>Yes, I do. A.38 Target Master</i>
<i>in my gun safe downstairs.</i>

01:07:52.362 --> 01:07:55.456
A.45 Gold Cup,
a.22 target pistol. So what?

01:07:56.900 --> 01:08:00.529
Do you have a history
of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?

01:08:00.603 --> 01:08:02.662
Yeah. Yes, I do.

01:08:02.739 --> 01:08:06.470
Yes, I get extremely emotional when
assholes put bullets in my mailbox.

01:08:06.543 --> 01:08:10.639
I didn't tell you that so you could
pick it up and take it away.

01:08:10.713 --> 01:08:13.238
- Jeffrey!
- What's going on?

01:08:13.316 --> 01:08:15.250
I told them you had an e-mail
death threat that told you...

01:08:15.318 --> 01:08:17.252
if you didn't shut the "F" up,
they were gonna kill you.

01:08:17.319 --> 01:08:20.756
You can't take that. It's personal
property. My personal correspondence,

01:08:20.823 --> 01:08:23.554
letters to my brother, my will.

01:08:35.104 --> 01:08:37.037
You all right?

01:08:46.416 --> 01:08:48.350
That computer has
every single...

01:08:49.685 --> 01:08:51.688
<i>You all right, Mr. Wigand?</i>

01:08:51.821 --> 01:08:54.721
We need to take a look
at your gun safe, Mr. Wigand.

01:09:11.808 --> 01:09:15.767
I'm telling <i>you...</i> your agents
in that office are acting improperly.

01:09:15.845 --> 01:09:17.779
Now who are they
trying to protect?

01:09:17.846 --> 01:09:19.781
Let me, tell you something,
Lowell. Look, look.

01:09:19.849 --> 01:09:22.113
You're talking about two agents
in a regional office in Louisville.

01:09:22.185 --> 01:09:25.381
I got the goddamned Unabomber
threatening to blow up L.A.X.

01:09:25.455 --> 01:09:29.720
I gotta move 45 agents
from all over the country into L.A.

01:09:29.792 --> 01:09:31.725
All right? When I get a chance,
I'll give it a look.

01:09:31.794 --> 01:09:34.627
You better take a good
look because I'm getting two things:

01:09:34.697 --> 01:09:36.892
Pissed off and curious!

01:09:36.966 --> 01:09:41.767
Now, any of these guys been offered jobs
in corporate security after they retire?

01:09:41.837 --> 01:09:45.171
Either one of those guys got
ex-agent pals already in those jobs?

01:09:45.241 --> 01:09:48.506
Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor
who's already at Brown & Williamson...

01:09:48.578 --> 01:09:50.636
as we fuckin' speak!

01:09:50.712 --> 01:09:52.647
- I'll give it a look.
- You're getting my drift?

01:09:52.715 --> 01:09:54.649
I'll give it a look.

01:09:56.119 --> 01:09:58.485
So is everything okay?

01:10:00.089 --> 01:10:02.956
- How are the rooms? Comfortable?
- Yes, very.

01:10:03.025 --> 01:10:06.153
Do you know,
I enjoy your work so much.

01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:09.756
When you're talkin' to somebody,
I always feel like I'm right there.

01:10:09.832 --> 01:10:12.130
Thank you for saying that.

01:10:12.201 --> 01:10:14.362
Do you think we could
talk about the taping?

01:10:14.437 --> 01:10:18.874
Tomorrow's taping? Just so we
can get it out of the way and order.

01:10:18.941 --> 01:10:24.004
Yeah, well, questions will go
towards what work you did there,
why you were fired and other...

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:26.674
Taping?

01:10:30.286 --> 01:10:34.382
- What are you taping?
- I'm doin' an interview.

01:10:37.226 --> 01:10:39.524
An interview?

01:10:44.767 --> 01:10:47.702
Do you know what
they will do to us?

01:10:47.770 --> 01:10:49.738
I thought we...

01:10:53.709 --> 01:10:55.677
I'm sorry.

01:10:55.745 --> 01:10:57.679
Liane, this is
a preliminary...

01:11:07.056 --> 01:11:10.150
You didn't
tell her we were taping?

01:11:10.226 --> 01:11:13.992
What did she think she was
coming to New York for?

01:11:14.063 --> 01:11:17.499
Talk about it, think about it.
I had a plan to, uh, ease her into it,

01:11:17.567 --> 01:11:20.400
but I really...
I don't know how to do that.

01:11:26.075 --> 01:11:28.669
Oh, man.

01:11:32.815 --> 01:11:34.749
Who are these people?

01:11:37.553 --> 01:11:40.716
Ordinary people under
extraordinary pressure, Mike.

01:11:42.525 --> 01:11:45.392
What the hell you expect,
grace and consistency?

01:12:13.856 --> 01:12:17.724
<i>Five, four, three, two...</i>

01:12:19.262 --> 01:12:21.492
You heard Mr. Sandefur say...

01:12:21.564 --> 01:12:26.160
before Congress that he believed
nicotine was not addictive.

01:12:26.235 --> 01:12:29.227
I believe Mr. Sandefur
perjured himself...

01:12:29.305 --> 01:12:31.239
because I watched those
testimonies very carefully.

01:12:31.307 --> 01:12:35.505
<i> All of us did. I mean,</i>
<i>there was this whole line of people,</i>

01:12:35.578 --> 01:12:38.103
<i>whole line of C.E.O. 's</i>
<i>up there swearing.</i>

01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:42.241
<i>Part of the reason</i>
<i>I'm here is that I felt...</i>

01:12:42.318 --> 01:12:44.718
that their representation
clearly misstated...

01:12:44.787 --> 01:12:46.721
at least within Brown & Williamson's
representation...

01:12:46.789 --> 01:12:51.123
clearly misstated what is common
language within the company.

01:12:51.193 --> 01:12:53.593
We are in
the nicotine delivery business.

01:12:53.663 --> 01:12:55.756
And that's what
cigarettes are for.

01:12:55.831 --> 01:12:58.095
Delivery device for nicotine.

01:12:58.167 --> 01:13:00.101
A delivery device
for nicotine.

01:13:00.169 --> 01:13:02.967
Put it in your mouth, light it up
and you're going to get your fix.

01:13:03.039 --> 01:13:07.476
- You're gonna get your fix.
<i>- You're saying that</i>
<i>Brown & Williamson...</i>

01:13:07.543 --> 01:13:10.671
<i>manipulates and adjusts</i>
<i>the nicotine fix...</i>

01:13:10.746 --> 01:13:12.680
not by artificially
adding nicotine,

01:13:12.748 --> 01:13:15.774
but by enhancing
the effect of nicotine...

01:13:15.851 --> 01:13:20.288
<i>through the use</i>
<i>of chemical elements such as ammonia.</i>

01:13:20.356 --> 01:13:23.052
The process is known
as impact boosting.

01:13:23.125 --> 01:13:25.821
<i>While not spiking nicotine,</i>

01:13:25.895 --> 01:13:28.830
<i>they clearly manipulate it.</i>

01:13:28.898 --> 01:13:33.301
There is extensive use of this
technology, known as ammonia chemistry.

01:13:33.369 --> 01:13:36.930
It allows for the nicotine to be
more rapidly absorbed in the lung...

01:13:37.006 --> 01:13:39.702
and therefore affect the brain
and central nervous system.

01:13:43.946 --> 01:13:47.575
<i>The straw that broke the camel's</i>
<i>back for me and really put me</i>
<i>in trouble with Sandefur...</i>

01:13:47.650 --> 01:13:50.312
was a compound called coumarin.

01:13:50.386 --> 01:13:52.320
When I came on board
at B&W,

01:13:52.388 --> 01:13:57.121
they had tried to transition
from coumarin to a similar flavor...

01:13:57.193 --> 01:14:00.822
that would give the same taste
and had been unsuccessful.

01:14:00.896 --> 01:14:04.525
I wanted it out immediately.
I was told...

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:08.627
that it would effect sales, so
I should mind my own business.

01:14:08.704 --> 01:14:11.764
I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur
indicating I could not in conscience...

01:14:11.841 --> 01:14:14.571
continue with coumarin
in a product that we now knew...

01:14:14.643 --> 01:14:19.103
we had documentation... was similar to
coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen.

01:14:19.181 --> 01:14:21.945
And you sent the document
forward to Sandefur?

01:14:22.018 --> 01:14:23.952
I sent the document
forward to Sandefur.

01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:27.421
I was told that we would
continue to work on a substitute.

01:14:27.490 --> 01:14:31.290
We weren't going to remove it
as it would impact sales
and that that was his decision.

01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:34.022
<i> In other words,</i>
<i>you are charging Sandefur...</i>

01:14:34.096 --> 01:14:36.030
and Brown & Williamson...

01:14:36.098 --> 01:14:38.464
with ignoring health
considerations consciously?

01:14:40.970 --> 01:14:43.734
- Most certainly.
- And on March 24,

01:14:43.806 --> 01:14:47.503
Thomas Sandefur,
C.E.O. Of Brown & Williamson,

01:14:47.576 --> 01:14:49.942
had you fired.

01:14:51.547 --> 01:14:53.481
<i>And the reason</i>
<i>he gave you?</i>

01:14:55.484 --> 01:14:57.679
Poor communication skills.

01:14:59.822 --> 01:15:03.417
And you wish
you hadn't come forward?

01:15:03.492 --> 01:15:06.086
You wish you hadn't
blown the whistle?

01:15:07.696 --> 01:15:10.130
Yeah, there are times
I wish I hadn't done it.

01:15:12.034 --> 01:15:15.299
There are times I feel com...
compelled to do it.

01:15:17.239 --> 01:15:19.207
If you'd asked me...

01:15:19.275 --> 01:15:21.903
would I do it again,
do I think it's worth it?

01:15:25.781 --> 01:15:27.840
Yeah, I think it's worth it.

01:16:01.083 --> 01:16:04.211
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:16:04.286 --> 01:16:06.652
My name is Jeff Wigand.

01:16:09.224 --> 01:16:11.556
You can call me, uh,
Mr. Wigand.

01:16:11.627 --> 01:16:13.561
You can call me
Dr. Wigand.

01:16:13.629 --> 01:16:17.190
I have a Ph.D. In biochemistry
and endocrinology.

01:16:17.266 --> 01:16:19.996
You can call me Jeff.

01:16:21.770 --> 01:16:24.500
Anything else you want to call me,
you'll have to do so in private.

01:16:24.573 --> 01:16:28.339
Um, okay.

01:16:28.410 --> 01:16:30.640
I find chemistry
to be magical.

01:16:30.713 --> 01:16:32.874
I find it an adventure.

01:16:32.948 --> 01:16:37.317
An exploration into the building
blocks of our physical universe.

01:16:37.386 --> 01:16:39.877
So how many of you have
taken chemistry before?

01:16:42.891 --> 01:16:45.883
Okay. I've never taught it
before, so we're gonna be fine.

01:16:45.961 --> 01:16:48.725
Our first experiment
is gonna be measuring...

01:16:48.797 --> 01:16:50.822
the molecular weight
of butane.

01:16:52.868 --> 01:16:55.496
He's on line three.

01:16:58.907 --> 01:17:02.707
- Hello?
- Mr. Scruggs? Jeff Wigand.

01:17:02.778 --> 01:17:04.871
Lowell Bergman said
I should give you a call.

01:17:04.947 --> 01:17:07.438
My co-counsel,
Ron Motley and I,

01:17:07.516 --> 01:17:10.917
have filed a lawsuit against
the tobacco industry on behalf
of the state of Mississippi...

01:17:10.986 --> 01:17:13.511
to get the state
reimbursed Medicaid costs...

01:17:13.589 --> 01:17:16.183
for treatin' people
with smoking-related illness.

01:17:17.393 --> 01:17:19.418
If you'd be interested
in talkin' to us,

01:17:19.495 --> 01:17:21.861
we'd certainly like
to talk to you.

01:17:23.766 --> 01:17:25.631
When should we do this?

01:17:49.358 --> 01:17:51.826
Who the hell are you?
What are you doing in my house?

01:17:51.894 --> 01:17:54.454
<i>- It's okay, Jeff. It's okay.</i>
- Mr. Wigand, you need to speak to...

01:17:54.530 --> 01:17:58.830
You've got
your own security now.

01:18:01.103 --> 01:18:03.367
You know, Lowell,
I can't... I can't afford to...

01:18:03.439 --> 01:18:07.603
No, they volunteered.
A friend owns a large security company.

01:18:07.676 --> 01:18:10.770
<i>How're you doing, Mr. Wigand?</i>
<i>I'm John Telafarro.</i>

01:18:10.846 --> 01:18:13.747
There'll be three of us
on the detail.

01:18:13.816 --> 01:18:17.843
I'm going to the store. Please explain
our new houseguests to your children.

01:18:19.621 --> 01:18:22.988
Mrs. Wigand's leaving the house.

01:18:26.195 --> 01:18:29.961
Uh, I called Richard Scruggs
in Mississippi.

01:18:30.032 --> 01:18:34.492
- I heard.
- I'm gonna be a witness for them
in their litigation.

01:18:36.572 --> 01:18:39.097
So I'm gonna fly to Pascagoula,
give a deposition.

01:18:39.174 --> 01:18:41.369
I know. I'm gonna
go there tonight.

01:18:43.278 --> 01:18:46.008
<i>You all right?</i>

01:18:46.081 --> 01:18:48.606
- Did you have a good day?
- Yes, I did. I had a great day.

01:18:48.684 --> 01:18:51.278
<i>- Uh, coffee, Lowell?</i>
- Yeah, all right.

01:18:51.353 --> 01:18:53.685
Wanna play that game
we were playing before?

01:18:53.755 --> 01:18:56.588
You know, I think you
got it up to five.

01:18:56.658 --> 01:18:59.024
<i>I was ahead of you,</i>
<i>and then you just...</i>

01:19:19.481 --> 01:19:23.178
Please don't wash your hands
in the sink.

01:19:23.252 --> 01:19:26.312
Where should I wash them?

01:19:26.388 --> 01:19:28.856
Use the bathroom.

01:19:28.924 --> 01:19:30.858
What's the difference?

01:19:30.926 --> 01:19:32.860
That's for food.

01:19:46.341 --> 01:19:49.435
Leave it on.
Just leave it on! Okay?

01:20:46.668 --> 01:20:48.898
I don't think
I can do this.

01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:57.408
I want to stand by
my husband.

01:20:57.479 --> 01:20:59.811
I really do, Jeffrey,
but...

01:21:01.717 --> 01:21:04.117
I don't think I can
do this anymore.

01:21:07.422 --> 01:21:09.356
I am so sorry.

01:21:28.844 --> 01:21:31.677
Can we talk about this
when I get back?

01:21:37.219 --> 01:21:39.153
Yes, Jeffrey.

01:22:35.011 --> 01:22:37.980
It's okay.

01:22:50.693 --> 01:22:52.718
Jeff!

01:22:56.433 --> 01:22:58.367
You've been served.

01:23:10.914 --> 01:23:13.576
Now, what this one is is
a temporary restraining order,

01:23:13.650 --> 01:23:17.108
a gag order,
issued by a Kentucky court.

01:23:17.187 --> 01:23:19.781
Jeff Wigand,
Michael Moore.

01:23:19.856 --> 01:23:21.790
Good to meet you,
Dr. Wigand.

01:23:21.858 --> 01:23:23.849
<i>Mike's our attorney general</i>
<i>down here.</i>

01:23:23.927 --> 01:23:26.157
<i>I was just explaining to Jeff</i>
<i>they got a Kentucky court...</i>

01:23:26.229 --> 01:23:29.096
<i>to issue a gag order</i>
<i>to stop his deposition today.</i>

01:23:29.165 --> 01:23:31.292
<i>- Right.</i>
- Now,

01:23:31.367 --> 01:23:33.733
they tried to get
the Mississippi court to honor it,

01:23:33.803 --> 01:23:35.737
but the judge threw it out.

01:23:35.805 --> 01:23:40.606
However, for you, there is a more
perilous effect of the gag order.

01:23:40.677 --> 01:23:44.738
Dr. Wigand, you do understand
what can happen, don't you?

01:23:47.484 --> 01:23:51.716
I'm not free to testify...
here.

01:23:51.788 --> 01:23:54.586
That's right. If you violate
the Kentucky order,

01:23:54.657 --> 01:23:56.818
when you
step foot back in Kentucky...

01:23:56.893 --> 01:23:59.862
they can find you in contempt
and they can incarcerate you.

01:23:59.929 --> 01:24:01.863
And you ought to know that.

01:24:05.502 --> 01:24:07.800
- Jail.
- Possibly, yes.

01:24:07.871 --> 01:24:10.897
That is one of the possible consequences
of your testifying here today.

01:24:10.974 --> 01:24:12.908
That's right.

01:24:18.014 --> 01:24:21.541
How does...
How does one go to jail?

01:24:21.618 --> 01:24:25.281
Wh-What does my family do?

01:24:25.355 --> 01:24:27.721
Go on welfare?

01:24:27.790 --> 01:24:31.055
If my wife has to work,
who's gonna look after the kids?

01:24:31.127 --> 01:24:33.618
Put food on the table?
I mean, my children need me.

01:24:33.696 --> 01:24:35.926
If I'm not teaching,
there's no medical.

01:24:35.999 --> 01:24:39.901
No medical, even on co-pay,
that's like... Tuition...

01:24:39.969 --> 01:24:42.870
Dr. Wigand, listen.

01:24:42.939 --> 01:24:45.373
You may not be able
to do this thing.

01:24:45.441 --> 01:24:48.171
As I understand from Dick,
you're our key witness,

01:24:48.244 --> 01:24:51.680
and I hope
you don't withdraw.

01:24:51.748 --> 01:24:54.239
Um, I guess we'd all
understand if you did.

01:24:55.552 --> 01:24:57.645
Guys, I gotta go.
I'm gonna be late for court.

01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:01.087
I'll see y'all later.
Dr. Wigand, good luck.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.491
I know what you're facing,
Jeff.

01:25:13.570 --> 01:25:15.538
And I think I know
how you're feeling.

01:25:17.407 --> 01:25:21.707
In the navy, I flew
A-6's off carriers.

01:25:21.778 --> 01:25:25.236
In combat, events have
a duration of seconds.

01:25:25.315 --> 01:25:27.647
Sometimes minutes.

01:25:27.717 --> 01:25:30.584
But what you're going through
goes on day in, day out,

01:25:30.653 --> 01:25:32.814
whether you're
ready for it or not.

01:25:32.889 --> 01:25:34.823
Week in, week out.

01:25:34.891 --> 01:25:37.553
Month after month
after month.

01:25:37.627 --> 01:25:41.154
Whether you're up
or whether you're down.

01:25:41.231 --> 01:25:44.166
You're assaulted
psychologically.

01:25:44.234 --> 01:25:46.566
You're assaulted
financially,

01:25:46.636 --> 01:25:51.300
which is its own special kind
of violence because it's
directed at your kids.

01:25:51.374 --> 01:25:53.706
What school can you afford?

01:25:53.776 --> 01:25:56.267
How will that
affect their lives?

01:25:56.346 --> 01:25:58.280
You're asking yourself,

01:25:58.348 --> 01:26:01.647
"Will that limit
what they may become?"

01:26:01.718 --> 01:26:04.414
You feel your whole family's future
is compromised,

01:26:04.487 --> 01:26:07.047
held hostage.

01:26:07.123 --> 01:26:09.250
I do know how it is.

01:26:23.706 --> 01:26:25.640
You attract a crowd.

01:26:25.708 --> 01:26:27.642
Yeah.
Great.

01:26:29.579 --> 01:26:32.639
I heard about
the Kentucky gag order.

01:26:36.319 --> 01:26:38.753
I don't know what to do.

01:27:41.216 --> 01:27:44.515
Hold on a second.

01:27:44.586 --> 01:27:48.682
Would you please ask Mr. Motley if he
expects his witness to appear or not?

01:28:16.384 --> 01:28:19.285
I can't seem to find
the criteria to decide.

01:28:21.289 --> 01:28:24.588
It's too big a decision to make
without being resolved in my own mind.

01:28:26.928 --> 01:28:29.897
Maybe things have changed.

01:28:51.119 --> 01:28:53.053
A lot's changed.

01:28:58.326 --> 01:29:00.294
You mean since this morning?

01:29:02.597 --> 01:29:05.828
No, I mean since whenever.

01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:14.440
Fuck it.

01:29:14.509 --> 01:29:16.670
Let's go to court.

01:29:16.745 --> 01:29:19.441
<i>Dr. Wigand would like to leave now.</i>

01:31:44.092 --> 01:31:46.526
Okay, Jeff. I'm gonna sit you down
at that table over there.

01:31:46.594 --> 01:31:48.528
I want to start
as fast as possible.

01:31:48.596 --> 01:31:50.996
I don't want to give them a chance to
get another restraining order. Okay?

01:31:51.066 --> 01:31:53.000
- Let's go.
- Good luck, Doc.

01:32:01.242 --> 01:32:04.905
Please stand.
Raise your right hand.

01:32:04.979 --> 01:32:09.109
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

01:32:09.184 --> 01:32:12.347
<i>- I do.</i>
<i>- You may be seated.</i>

01:32:12.420 --> 01:32:15.218
<i>You understand, Dr. Wigand,</i>
<i>you are under oath?</i>

01:32:15.290 --> 01:32:19.317
This is a sworn deposition.
There's no judge. It's not a trial.

01:32:19.394 --> 01:32:22.557
Will you state your name
for the record?

01:32:22.630 --> 01:32:26.168
Jeffrey S. Wigand.
R-E-Y. W-I-G-A-N-D.

01:32:29.671 --> 01:32:32.105
Got any idea what's
going on in there?

01:32:32.174 --> 01:32:34.108
No, I don't have
a clue.

01:32:36.344 --> 01:32:38.812
- That is correct.
- In other words, it acts as a drug,

01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:41.144
- Object to the form of the question.
- It acts as a drug...

01:32:41.216 --> 01:32:43.047
- Object to the form...
- It acts as a drug...

01:32:43.118 --> 01:32:45.211
- Object!
- Is there an echo in here?

01:32:45.287 --> 01:32:47.312
<i>Your objection's been recorded.</i>

01:32:47.389 --> 01:32:50.552
<i>She typed it into her little machine</i>
<i>over there. It's on the record.</i>

01:32:50.625 --> 01:32:55.119
<i>So now I'll proceed</i>
<i>with my deposition of my witness.</i>

01:32:57.032 --> 01:33:00.331
- Does it act as a drug?
- Dr. Wigand!

01:33:00.402 --> 01:33:02.927
I am instructing you...

01:33:03.004 --> 01:33:05.404
<i>not to answer that question.</i>

01:33:05.473 --> 01:33:09.102
In accordance to the terms of
the contractual obligations...

01:33:09.177 --> 01:33:11.702
<i>undertaken by you...</i>

01:33:11.780 --> 01:33:14.840
<i>not to disclose</i>
<i>any information...</i>

01:33:14.916 --> 01:33:18.613
about your work at the Brown
& Williamson Tobacco Company.

01:33:18.687 --> 01:33:21.918
And in accordance
with the force and effect...

01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:24.083
of the temporary
restraining order...

01:33:24.159 --> 01:33:26.320
<i>that has been</i>
<i>entered against you...</i>

01:33:26.394 --> 01:33:30.262
<i>by the court</i>
<i>in the state of Kentucky.</i>

01:33:30.332 --> 01:33:32.994
That means you don't talk.

01:33:33.068 --> 01:33:35.093
Mr. Motley, we have rights here.

01:33:35.170 --> 01:33:37.468
Oh, you've got rights.

01:33:37.539 --> 01:33:41.532
And lefts.
Ups and downs and middles.

01:33:41.610 --> 01:33:46.309
So what? You don't get
to instruct anything around here!

01:33:46.381 --> 01:33:50.681
This is not North Carolina,
not South Carolina, nor Kentucky.

01:33:50.752 --> 01:33:54.153
This is the sovereign state
of Mississippi's proceeding.

01:33:54.222 --> 01:33:57.055
Wipe that smirk off your face!

01:33:57.125 --> 01:34:01.027
Dr. Wigand's deposition
will be part of this record!

01:34:01.096 --> 01:34:05.123
And I'm gonna take my witness' testimony
whether the hell you like it or not!

01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:21.114
Answer the question,
Doctor.

01:34:21.182 --> 01:34:26.381
<i>Yes. It produces</i>
<i>a physiological response, which</i>
<i>meets the definition of a drug.</i>

01:34:26.454 --> 01:34:29.685
Um, nicotine
is associated with...

01:34:29.758 --> 01:34:32.192
impact, satisfaction.

01:34:32.260 --> 01:34:36.822
It has a pharmacological effect that
crosses the blood-brain barrier intact.

01:34:39.768 --> 01:34:42.635
<i>Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.</i>

01:35:26.481 --> 01:35:28.915
One of the reasons
I'm here is that I felt...

01:35:28.983 --> 01:35:32.248
that their representation
clearly...

01:35:34.489 --> 01:35:38.653
Run that Sandefur piece
on "nicotine's not addictive."

01:35:38.727 --> 01:35:42.322
Run that on camera, then cut right to
Wigand with "I believe they perjured..."

01:35:42.397 --> 01:35:45.230
Then go wide to the C.E.O. S
all taking the oath.

01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:48.235
Then back on Jeff...

01:35:48.303 --> 01:35:50.897
and play the pause after
the word "felt" on the B-side.

01:35:50.972 --> 01:35:54.271
Hell of a show, Mike.
Explosive material.

01:35:56.378 --> 01:35:59.108
- It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
- Good.

01:36:00.382 --> 01:36:02.441
- I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:36:02.517 --> 01:36:05.850
They argued that he was going
to reveal the secret formula
of Kools to the world.

01:36:08.490 --> 01:36:10.958
<i>Sealed doesn't hurt Scruggsâ€™ litigation,</i>

01:36:11.025 --> 01:36:14.620
<i>and since we're the only ones</i>
<i>with the story, I believe</i>
<i>we're sitting on an exclusive.</i>

01:36:14.696 --> 01:36:17.096
I like that.
<i>Corporate has some questions.</i>

01:36:17.165 --> 01:36:19.531
<i>We've got a meeting at "Black Rock"</i>
<i>first thing in the morning.</i>

01:36:19.601 --> 01:36:23.628
- When's the air date?
<i>- Lowell, Sharon's on line three.</i>

01:36:23.705 --> 01:36:27.801
- Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
<i>- Here we go.</i>

01:36:27.876 --> 01:36:30.344
That they had long
known that the nicotine in tobacco...

01:36:30.412 --> 01:36:34.712
is an addictive drug despite their
public statements to the contrary.

01:36:34.783 --> 01:36:38.549
Like the testimony before Congress
of Dr. Wigand's former boss,

01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:42.579
Brown & Williamson's chief
executive officer, Thomas Sandefur.

01:36:42.657 --> 01:36:45.182
I believe that nicotine
is not addictive.

01:36:45.260 --> 01:36:47.820
I believe Mr. Sandefur
perjured himself...

01:36:47.896 --> 01:36:50.364
because I watched those
testimonies very carefully.

01:36:50.432 --> 01:36:53.924
All of us did.
There was this whole line of people,

01:36:54.002 --> 01:36:56.436
whole line of C.E.O.'s
up there all swearing.

01:36:56.504 --> 01:36:59.200
Part of the reason
I'm here is that I felt...

01:37:00.408 --> 01:37:02.467
that their representation
clearly misstated...

01:37:02.544 --> 01:37:04.808
what is common language
within the company.

01:37:04.879 --> 01:37:07.143
We are in the nicotine
delivery business.

01:37:07.215 --> 01:37:10.742
<i>There is extensive use of this</i>
<i>technology, known as ammonia chemistry.</i>

01:37:10.819 --> 01:37:14.721
<i>It allows for the nicotine to be</i>
<i>more rapidly absorbed in the lung...</i>

01:37:14.789 --> 01:37:17.451
and therefore affect the brain
and central nervous system.

01:37:17.525 --> 01:37:20.585
That's what cigarettes are for.
- Delivery device for nicotine.

01:37:20.662 --> 01:37:23.529
A delivery device
for nicotine. Put it in your mouth,

01:37:23.598 --> 01:37:25.691
light it up and
you're going to get your fix.

01:37:25.767 --> 01:37:28.099
You're going to get your fix.

01:40:32.286 --> 01:40:35.255
- Shall I send for coffee?
Sorry I'm late.
- No, we're fine.

01:40:35.322 --> 01:40:38.120
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:40:38.192 --> 01:40:40.490
All right. I thought
we'd get together...

01:40:40.561 --> 01:40:42.495
because there's
a legal concept...

01:40:42.563 --> 01:40:45.259
that has been getting
some new attention recently.

01:40:45.332 --> 01:40:47.425
Tortious interference.

01:40:47.501 --> 01:40:51.301
<i>If two people have an agreement,</i>
<i>like a confidentiality agreement,</i>

01:40:51.372 --> 01:40:55.832
and one of them breaks it because they
are induced to do so by a third party,

01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:59.004
the third party can be sued
for damages for interfering.

01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:01.275
Hence, tortious interference.

01:41:01.348 --> 01:41:04.476
"Interfering"?
That's what we do.

01:41:04.552 --> 01:41:07.282
<i>I think what we're trying to tell you</i>
<i>is that it happens all the time.</i>

01:41:07.354 --> 01:41:11.381
This is a news organization. People are
always telling us things they shouldn't.

01:41:11.459 --> 01:41:15.691
We have to verify if it's true
and in the public interest.
And if it is, we air it.

01:41:15.763 --> 01:41:20.097
And after we corroborate it.
That's why we've never lost
a lawsuit and run a classy show.

01:41:20.167 --> 01:41:24.968
- Anything else?
- And <i>60 Minutes'</i> verification
is exact and precise.

01:41:25.039 --> 01:41:28.941
And I don't think it would hurt
to make sure you're right on this one.

01:41:29.009 --> 01:41:32.945
<i>Why? You think we have liability?</i>

01:41:33.013 --> 01:41:35.106
What's the CBS News position,
Eric?

01:41:35.182 --> 01:41:37.343
There's a possibility.
It's rather remote.

01:41:37.418 --> 01:41:40.410
But one we
have to check on, Mike.

01:41:40.488 --> 01:41:43.082
I've retained outside counsel
to do exactly that...

01:41:43.157 --> 01:41:47.753
on a segment, I might add,
that's already rife with problems.

01:41:47.828 --> 01:41:49.762
What does that mean?
"Rife with..."

01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:53.095
I'm told unusual promises
were made to Wigand.

01:41:53.167 --> 01:41:56.261
No, only that we would hold his story
until it was safe for him.

01:41:56.337 --> 01:41:59.431
And I'm told there are questions
as to our star witness' veracity.

01:41:59.507 --> 01:42:02.499
His "veracity" was good enough
for the state of Mississippi.

01:42:02.576 --> 01:42:05.044
Our standards have to be
higher than anyone else's,

01:42:05.112 --> 01:42:08.104
because we are the standard
for everybody else.

01:42:08.182 --> 01:42:13.347
Well, as a "standard," I'll hang with
"is this guy telling the truth?"

01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:16.150
Well, with tortious interference,
I'm afraid...

01:42:16.223 --> 01:42:19.715
the greater the truth,
the greater the damage.

01:42:21.328 --> 01:42:23.728
- Come again?
- They own...

01:42:23.798 --> 01:42:26.358
the information he's disclosing.

01:42:26.433 --> 01:42:28.492
The truer it is,

01:42:28.569 --> 01:42:30.560
the greater
the damage to them.

01:42:30.638 --> 01:42:34.267
If he lied, he didn't
disclose their information,
and the damages are smaller.

01:42:39.380 --> 01:42:44.215
- Is this <i>Alice in Wonderland?</i>
- You said "on this one."

01:42:44.285 --> 01:42:46.219
What about this one?

01:42:46.287 --> 01:42:49.984
<i>If this holds up...</i>
<i>And it very well may not, Mike.</i>

01:42:50.057 --> 01:42:53.356
But if it did
and we aired this segment,

01:42:53.427 --> 01:42:57.454
and CBS was sued
by Brown & Williamson,

01:42:57.531 --> 01:42:59.590
I think we could be
at grave risk.

01:42:59.667 --> 01:43:03.467
- How grave?
<i>- Well, at the end of the day,</i>

01:43:03.537 --> 01:43:06.233
because of your segment,

01:43:06.307 --> 01:43:08.741
the Brown & Williamson
Tobacco Company...

01:43:08.809 --> 01:43:10.834
could own CBS.

01:43:12.947 --> 01:43:15.848
Oh. You know,

01:43:15.916 --> 01:43:19.875
I am sorry,
but I'm due upstairs.

01:43:19.954 --> 01:43:22.923
Is CBS Corporate
telling CBS News...

01:43:22.990 --> 01:43:26.482
"Do not go to air
with this story"?

01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:29.188
You're getting ahead of yourself.
We're all in this together.

01:43:29.263 --> 01:43:32.460
We're all CBS.
We'll find out soon.

01:43:32.533 --> 01:43:34.467
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:43:41.508 --> 01:43:43.476
"Tortious interference."

01:43:43.544 --> 01:43:46.604
That sounds like a disease
caught by a radio.

01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:49.114
<i>- Lunch?</i>
- Sure.

01:43:49.183 --> 01:43:51.583
Don't worry.
We call the shots around here.

01:44:05.165 --> 01:44:07.531
Hello?

01:44:07.601 --> 01:44:10.434
Debbie, it's me. I want
you to check some filings,

01:44:10.504 --> 01:44:12.995
and give me John Wilson's number
at Bear-Stearn.

01:44:21.282 --> 01:44:23.716
- What now?
- Kluster's coming over.

01:44:31.392 --> 01:44:33.360
<i>Hello, Lowell, Mike.</i>

01:44:33.427 --> 01:44:35.793
<i>Don.</i>

01:44:35.863 --> 01:44:40.197
There has been so much soul searching
about this Wigand.

01:44:40.267 --> 01:44:42.400
I've decided we should cut
an alternate version of
the show without his interview.

01:44:42.435 --> 01:44:44.533
I've decided we should cut
an alternate version of
the show without his interview.

01:44:44.605 --> 01:44:49.269
So what happened to Ms. Caperelli's
checking with outside counsel first?

01:44:49.343 --> 01:44:51.277
- All that crap?
- That's happening.

01:44:51.345 --> 01:44:53.939
Hopefully, we won't have to use
the alternate, but we should
have it in the can.

01:44:54.014 --> 01:44:56.346
- I'm not touching my film.
- I'm afraid you are.

01:44:56.416 --> 01:45:00.580
- No, I'm not.
- We're doing this
with or without you, Lowell.

01:45:00.654 --> 01:45:04.613
If you like, I can assign
another producer to edit your show.

01:45:06.693 --> 01:45:08.786
Since when has the, uh,

01:45:08.862 --> 01:45:12.263
paragon of
investigative journalism...

01:45:12.332 --> 01:45:16.598
allowed lawyers to determine
the news content on <i>60 Minutes?</i>

01:45:16.670 --> 01:45:19.002
<i>It's an alternate version.</i>

01:45:19.072 --> 01:45:21.768
So what if we have
an alternate version?

01:45:21.842 --> 01:45:24.470
And I don't think our being cautious
is so damned unreasonable.

01:45:25.813 --> 01:45:27.747
So now, if you will
excuse me, gentlemen,

01:45:27.815 --> 01:45:30.409
Mr. Rather's been complaining
about his chair again.

01:45:30.484 --> 01:45:33.317
Before you go,

01:45:34.388 --> 01:45:36.356
I discovered this.

01:45:38.325 --> 01:45:42.887
S.E.C. Filing for the sale of CBS
Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.

01:45:42.963 --> 01:45:45.227
- What?
- Yeah, I heard rumors.

01:45:45.299 --> 01:45:48.427
It's not a rumor. It's a sale.
If Tisch can unload CBS...

01:45:48.502 --> 01:45:50.834
for $81 a share
to Westinghouse,

01:45:50.904 --> 01:45:52.872
and then is
suddenly threatened...

01:45:52.940 --> 01:45:56.706
with a multi-billion dollar
lawsuit from Brown & Williamson,

01:45:56.777 --> 01:45:58.711
that could screw up the sale,
could it not?

01:45:58.779 --> 01:46:02.715
<i>- What are you implying?</i>
- I'm not implying. I'm quoting.

01:46:02.783 --> 01:46:06.685
Uh, " More vested interests. Persons
who will profit from this merger.

01:46:06.753 --> 01:46:11.986
"Ms. Helen Caperelli, general counsel
of CBS News, 3.9 million.

01:46:12.059 --> 01:46:15.119
"Mr. Eric Kluster,
president of CBS News,

01:46:15.195 --> 01:46:18.062
1.4 million."

01:46:18.131 --> 01:46:21.259
<i> Are you suggesting that</i>
<i>she and Eric are influenced by money?</i>

01:46:21.335 --> 01:46:25.362
No, no, of course they're not
influenced by money. They work for free.

01:46:25.439 --> 01:46:27.873
And you are a volunteer
executive producer.

01:46:27.941 --> 01:46:31.877
CBS does not do that. And you're
questioning our journalistic integrity.

01:46:31.945 --> 01:46:33.879
No, I'm questioning
your hearing.

01:46:33.947 --> 01:46:36.245
You hear "reasonable"
and "tortious interference."

01:46:36.316 --> 01:46:39.513
I hear "potential Brown
& Williamson lawsuit...

01:46:39.586 --> 01:46:42.578
jeopardizing the sale
of CBS to Westinghouse."

01:46:42.656 --> 01:46:46.057
I hear "Shut the segment down.
Cut Wigand loose.

01:46:46.126 --> 01:46:48.924
Obey orders and fuck off."
That's what I hear.

01:46:48.996 --> 01:46:50.930
<i>- You're exaggerating.</i>
- I am?

01:46:50.998 --> 01:46:53.796
You pay me
to go get guys like Wigand,

01:46:53.867 --> 01:46:57.701
to draw him out, to get him to trust
us, to get him to go on television.

01:46:57.771 --> 01:47:00.672
I do. I deliver him.
He sits. He talks.

01:47:00.741 --> 01:47:04.108
He violates his own fucking
confidentiality agreement.

01:47:04.177 --> 01:47:08.238
And he's only the key witness in the
biggest public health reform issue,

01:47:08.315 --> 01:47:10.408
maybe the biggest,
most expensive...

01:47:10.484 --> 01:47:13.419
corporate malfeasance case
in U.S. History.

01:47:13.487 --> 01:47:15.819
And Jeffrey Wigand,
who's out on a limb,

01:47:15.889 --> 01:47:18.255
does he go on television
and tell the truth?

01:47:18.325 --> 01:47:20.657
Yes.
Is it newsworthy?

01:47:20.727 --> 01:47:23.423
Yes.
Are we gonna air it?

01:47:23.497 --> 01:47:25.488
Of course not. Why?

01:47:25.565 --> 01:47:27.829
Because he's not
telling the truth? No.

01:47:27.901 --> 01:47:31.735
<i>Because he is telling the truth.</i>
<i>That's why we're not gonna air it.</i>

01:47:31.805 --> 01:47:34.103
And the more truth he tells,
the worse it gets.

01:47:34.174 --> 01:47:38.110
<i> You are a fanatic,</i>
<i>an anarchist. You know that?</i>

01:47:38.178 --> 01:47:41.705
If we can't have a whole show, then
I want half a show rather than no show.

01:47:41.782 --> 01:47:45.548
But, oh, no. Not you. You
won't be satisfied unless you're
putting the company at risk!

01:47:45.619 --> 01:47:48.850
What are you? Are you a businessman
or are you a newsman?

01:47:48.922 --> 01:47:51.288
Because that happens to be
what Mike and I...

01:47:51.358 --> 01:47:53.986
and some other people
around here do for a living.

01:47:54.061 --> 01:47:57.656
<i>- Lowell...</i>
- Put the corporation at risk?
Give me a fucking break!

01:47:57.731 --> 01:47:59.892
These people are
putting our whole reason...

01:47:59.967 --> 01:48:02.629
- for doing what we do on the line!
- Lowell!

01:48:02.703 --> 01:48:04.728
What?

01:48:04.805 --> 01:48:07.000
I'm with Don
on this.

01:48:29.463 --> 01:48:31.431
What's wrong?

01:48:31.498 --> 01:48:34.058
They're killing
the Wigand interview.

01:48:34.134 --> 01:48:38.400
- What?
- They're pretending it's process.
That's bullshit. It's foregone.

01:48:41.808 --> 01:48:43.742
What are you and Mike
gonna do?

01:48:46.546 --> 01:48:49.174
I'm alone on this.

01:48:50.250 --> 01:48:52.582
- Oh, baby.
- Yeah.

01:49:21.782 --> 01:49:23.716
It's Jeffrey Wigand.

01:49:33.493 --> 01:49:36.985
Jeffrey.
How are you?

01:49:37.064 --> 01:49:39.191
How's the family?
Okay?

01:49:39.266 --> 01:49:42.201
- There is... There is no family.
- What do you mean, "there is no family"?

01:49:42.269 --> 01:49:44.567
Uh, Liane has filed for divorce.

01:49:44.638 --> 01:49:47.971
And, so,
I've moved out.

01:49:48.041 --> 01:49:50.601
I see the girls
a couple of days a week.

01:49:50.677 --> 01:49:56.047
- Where are you staying now?
- Our favorite hotel, honey.

01:49:56.116 --> 01:50:00.212
I checked into room 930.

01:50:00.287 --> 01:50:02.221
Odd choice, huh?

01:50:06.026 --> 01:50:08.256
I don't know how
to say this,

01:50:08.328 --> 01:50:10.694
Jeff, except to just
say it right out.

01:50:10.764 --> 01:50:14.996
So, uh, I'll say it.
They do not want to air it.

01:50:16.870 --> 01:50:22.001
- What?
- B&W may have threatened litigation.

01:50:22.075 --> 01:50:24.635
CBS is on the block.

01:50:24.711 --> 01:50:27.839
- But you, I mean... I know how you...
- No.

01:50:28.949 --> 01:50:31.076
No, what?

01:50:31.151 --> 01:50:35.918
I do not think that you know for me
what it is to walk in my shoes.

01:50:37.691 --> 01:50:40.785
For my kids
to have seen it,

01:50:40.861 --> 01:50:43.728
for them to know why I've
put them through what I did.

01:50:43.797 --> 01:50:47.392
The public airing of that,
the testament to why I did what I did.

01:50:47.467 --> 01:50:50.436
You're telling me it's not
gonna see the light of day?

01:50:50.504 --> 01:50:53.268
Jeff.

01:51:35.916 --> 01:51:37.850
Mrs. Wigand?

01:51:39.586 --> 01:51:42.783
It hasn't been Mrs. Wigand
for some time.

01:51:42.856 --> 01:51:47.520
I'm an investigator, and I was
wondering if I could ask you a
couple of questions about that.

01:51:49.396 --> 01:51:51.330
All right.

01:51:55.335 --> 01:51:57.860
Um, seven months
after we were married,

01:51:57.938 --> 01:52:00.372
we found out that I had
multiple sclerosis.

01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:02.374
<i>And you had a daughter, Diane...</i>

01:52:02.442 --> 01:52:04.376
<i>Tommy Sandefur told me himself.</i>

01:52:04.444 --> 01:52:08.904
<i>He's not going to allow Brown</i>
<i>& Williamson to be demonized</i>
<i>to the American public.</i>

01:52:08.982 --> 01:52:11.974
So I told Pete Jennings.
And I... Hold on.

01:52:12.052 --> 01:52:15.681
You had multiple sclerosis.
You had a small child to raise.

01:52:15.755 --> 01:52:19.816
Uh, mention that part in the
executive summary and in the chapters.

01:52:19.893 --> 01:52:22.293
First wife
and estrangement of daughter.

01:52:22.362 --> 01:52:24.796
So I was telling Pete, I said,
"You've been taken in by this guy."

01:52:24.864 --> 01:52:27.594
The divorce was something
that we both wanted.

01:52:28.702 --> 01:52:31.330
He's a shoplifter.

01:52:31.404 --> 01:52:33.872
He's a convicted
shoplifter.

01:52:52.459 --> 01:52:55.792
So, um, what are you
gonna do?

01:52:55.862 --> 01:52:59.025
What do you think I'm gonna do?
Quit in protest?

01:52:59.099 --> 01:53:01.329
I'm not gonna do that.

01:53:01.401 --> 01:53:03.335
You're taking "no"
for an answer?

01:53:03.403 --> 01:53:06.372
No, I'm not gonna take
"no" for an answer. No.

01:53:06.439 --> 01:53:09.567
You're not?
What <i>are</i> you doing?

01:53:09.643 --> 01:53:13.101
I'm staying right here, doing my job.
Fighting to get my show on the air.

01:53:13.179 --> 01:53:15.875
You don't like it?
Hey, I tell you what?

01:53:15.949 --> 01:53:19.009
Fire my ass.

01:53:19.085 --> 01:53:22.885
End up in a high-profile lawsuit with
Lowell, the First Amendment martyr?

01:53:26.192 --> 01:53:29.855
I don't think so.
Take a look at this.

01:53:29.929 --> 01:53:32.762
This is a summary of a dossier
that's being prepared.

01:53:32.832 --> 01:53:35.062
He wouldn't lie
about his whole life.

01:53:35.135 --> 01:53:37.899
Who's gonna believe him
about anything he says?

01:53:37.971 --> 01:53:41.771
<i>The</i> Wall Street Journal <i>is doing</i>
<i>a major story, and, I think, the</i> Post.

01:53:42.842 --> 01:53:45.174
You backed the wrong horse.

01:53:45.245 --> 01:53:49.579
The version without the interview
is gonna air the week after next.

01:53:55.355 --> 01:53:58.381
What was that about?

01:53:58.458 --> 01:54:00.483
- Get me Wigand.
- Sure.

01:54:03.563 --> 01:54:07.294
What the fuck is this?
Fuck!

01:54:07.367 --> 01:54:09.528
You never told me
you were married before.

01:54:09.602 --> 01:54:12.867
- That you had a daughter.
- How is that any of your business?

01:54:12.939 --> 01:54:15.339
That is not something
that you people need to know.

01:54:15.408 --> 01:54:17.376
Oh, you know what we do
or do not need to know?

01:54:17.444 --> 01:54:19.878
- Since when have you become
a media expert?
- What do you wanna do, Lowell?

01:54:19.946 --> 01:54:22.244
- Look up my ass too?
- Oh, for God's sake.

01:54:22.315 --> 01:54:25.045
- You're not even on this anymore.
What do you care?
- Jeff, wake the fuck up!

01:54:25.118 --> 01:54:28.610
Everybody is on the line here.
If they catch you in a lie,

01:54:28.688 --> 01:54:31.418
they can paint everything with
that brush, you understand?

01:54:31.491 --> 01:54:33.982
- Everything you say.
- I told the truth.

01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:37.587
Everything you say.
And I can't defend you, man,

01:54:37.664 --> 01:54:39.689
with one hand tied
behind my back...

01:54:39.766 --> 01:54:42.326
because you keep from me
what they can discover.

01:54:42.402 --> 01:54:45.132
And they will discover
everything. Believe me.

01:54:45.205 --> 01:54:47.366
I was young!
I was young!

01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:50.466
Confused. We didn't
handle it the right way.

01:54:50.543 --> 01:54:53.307
- She sued you for back payments
of child support?
- She did not sue me.

01:54:53.380 --> 01:54:58.511
We had a dispute over money. I settled
it. She dropped the complaint.

01:54:58.585 --> 01:55:00.519
- Any other questions?
- Yes. Did you lie...

01:55:00.587 --> 01:55:02.817
about being on the American
judo team in the Olympics?

01:55:03.923 --> 01:55:06.016
- What?
- Some public relations guy...

01:55:06.092 --> 01:55:08.151
got hold of a tape of an interview
where you're saying...

01:55:08.228 --> 01:55:10.788
you were on the American
judo team in the Olympics.

01:55:10.864 --> 01:55:13.992
What kind of shit is this?
I... I was...

01:55:14.067 --> 01:55:17.559
I was not <i>on</i> the team.
I <i>sparred</i> with the Olympic team.

01:55:17.637 --> 01:55:20.663
- Okay?
- All right. ABC Telemarketing Company?

01:55:20.740 --> 01:55:24.403
- ABC...
- ABC Telemarketing Company.

01:55:24.477 --> 01:55:27.344
The can opener!
A 39.95 can opener!

01:55:27.414 --> 01:55:30.110
I cancelled payment.
It was junk!

01:55:30.183 --> 01:55:33.346
You ever bounce a check, Lowell?
You ever look at another woman's tits?

01:55:33.420 --> 01:55:35.718
You ever cheat a little
on your taxes?

01:55:35.789 --> 01:55:39.350
Whose life, if you look at it under
a microscope, doesn't have any flaws?

01:55:39.426 --> 01:55:41.951
Well, that's the whole point, Jeffrey.
That's the whole point.

01:55:42.028 --> 01:55:45.896
Anyone's, everyone's.
They are gonna look under every rock,

01:55:45.965 --> 01:55:49.731
dig up every flaw,
every mistake you've ever made.

01:55:49.803 --> 01:55:53.762
They are going to distort and exaggerate
everything you've ever done, man.

01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:56.536
- Don't you understand?
- What does this have to do
with my testimony?

01:55:56.609 --> 01:55:58.770
- That's not the point...
- What does it have to do
with my testimony?

01:55:58.845 --> 01:56:01.575
- I told the truth!
It's true and provable!
- It's not about...

01:56:01.648 --> 01:56:05.015
That's not the fucking point,
whether you told the truth or not!

01:56:06.586 --> 01:56:08.520
Hello?

01:56:11.424 --> 01:56:13.790
I told the truth.

01:56:15.495 --> 01:56:17.429
I told the truth.

01:56:18.765 --> 01:56:21.325
I gotta teach class. I gotta go.

01:56:21.401 --> 01:56:25.167
- I gotta teach class.
- And I gotta refute every
fucking accusation made...

01:56:25.238 --> 01:56:28.105
in this report before
the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> runs.

01:56:31.945 --> 01:56:34.038
I am trying to protect you,
man.

01:56:35.148 --> 01:56:37.082
I hope you improve
your batting average.

01:56:56.536 --> 01:56:59.869
<i>They're cutting the interest rate,</i>
<i>and I have that great feature...</i>

01:57:06.212 --> 01:57:08.146
- Hello?
- It's Lowell.

01:57:08.214 --> 01:57:12.844
Are you guys planning to do a piece on
a former top executive in Big Tobacco?

01:57:12.919 --> 01:57:15.752
- You caught me in a news meeting.
- Are you, are you not, Charlie?

01:57:15.822 --> 01:57:17.813
You bet we are,
and I can't talk to you now.

01:57:17.891 --> 01:57:20.826
- We gotta hook up.
- Sure. Where?

01:57:20.894 --> 01:57:23.795
- P.J.'s.
- I'll be there.

01:57:30.837 --> 01:57:33.465
Yeah, I got it.
Five hundred pages of it.

01:57:33.540 --> 01:57:37.169
They looked in every corner
of this guy's life,
from the spousal abuse charge,

01:57:37.243 --> 01:57:40.940
to shoplifting, to a traffic ticket
he got once for running a red light.

01:57:41.014 --> 01:57:44.541
It's Terry Lenzner's outfit,
I.G.I. Jack, listen to me.

01:57:44.617 --> 01:57:49.213
Their strategy: Discredit
this guy, ruin his reputation
in the <i>Wall Street Journal...</i>

01:57:49.289 --> 01:57:52.690
and then nobody will ever listen
to what he's got to say about tobacco.

01:57:52.759 --> 01:57:55.887
He's dead unless I can
get this thing knocked down.

01:57:55.962 --> 01:57:58.396
Make it even
a little more attractive.

01:57:58.464 --> 01:58:01.058
I don't know if you're
ever gonna get paid.

01:58:01.134 --> 01:58:03.728
- Is there any truth to any of it?
- That's a good question.

01:58:03.803 --> 01:58:06.203
"Is there any truth to any of it?"
I doubt it.

01:58:06.272 --> 01:58:09.730
- What's the deadline?
- Soon.

01:58:13.679 --> 01:58:16.546
- Fax me the summary.
- That's great, Jack.

01:58:23.255 --> 01:58:26.816
- Hey. How are you? Hey, listen.
- Hey.

01:58:26.892 --> 01:58:30.191
I hear you guys are sitting
on something sensational over there.

01:58:30.262 --> 01:58:33.823
- Really? Hi, June.
- Oh, hi, baby.

01:58:35.634 --> 01:58:37.761
- Catch you later.
- Okay. Take care.

01:58:39.605 --> 01:58:41.539
- When's your deadline?
- Monday.

01:58:41.607 --> 01:58:44.542
- Push it.
- What? Forget it.

01:58:44.610 --> 01:58:46.544
It's a smear campaign,
Charlie.

01:58:46.612 --> 01:58:48.580
- It's drawn from
a selectively circulated...
- Oh, yeah.

01:58:48.647 --> 01:58:51.673
Real selective. About as hard to get
ahold of as the Manhattan phone book.

01:58:51.750 --> 01:58:55.550
Well, it's authoritive...
and overwhelmingly documented.

01:58:55.621 --> 01:58:58.613
And it's bullshit. And if
I'm right, are you gonna put...

01:58:58.691 --> 01:59:01.888
the <i>Journal's</i> reputation behind a story
that's gonna blow up in your face?

01:59:01.961 --> 01:59:05.863
I'll take a look at what you got
but I'm not moving any deadlines
because you say so.

01:59:13.439 --> 01:59:15.373
Are you all right?

01:59:17.643 --> 01:59:19.577
Yeah.

01:59:28.887 --> 01:59:31.287
Officer Muravchick?

01:59:31.357 --> 01:59:34.383
Thank you.

01:59:34.460 --> 01:59:36.860
Officer Muravchick,
how are you?

01:59:36.929 --> 01:59:39.022
- I'm Sandra Sutherland.
- How do you do?

01:59:39.098 --> 01:59:41.157
Fine, thank you.
I'm doing a background check.

01:59:41.233 --> 01:59:43.167
Mind if I sit down?

01:59:45.371 --> 01:59:49.137
Your Honor,
could I have a word with you?

01:59:49.208 --> 01:59:52.974
You presided in a dispute
over support payments.

01:59:53.045 --> 01:59:56.344
Jeffrey Wigand?
Yeah, I cited him.

01:59:56.415 --> 02:00:00.476
CBS is under criticism because
the CBS News program, <i>60 Minutes,</i>

02:00:00.552 --> 02:00:02.520
will not be presenting
an interview...

02:00:02.588 --> 02:00:05.489
What the hell
are you doing?

02:00:05.557 --> 02:00:07.582
What does it look like
I'm doing? I'm editing.

02:00:07.660 --> 02:00:10.527
No, no, no that. I'm talking
about the Associated Press.

02:00:10.596 --> 02:00:15.192
They got the story that
we pulled this interview,
and they talked to Mike and I.

02:00:15.267 --> 02:00:17.258
Did you tell them
that we were lying?

02:00:17.336 --> 02:00:19.304
No!
I should have.

02:00:19.371 --> 02:00:21.566
I told them I disagreed
with you, Mike and Kluster...

02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:24.473
that this segment
is as good as the original.

02:00:24.543 --> 02:00:26.670
<i>I'm not lying for you.</i>
<i>I'm not gonna shut up for you.</i>

02:00:26.745 --> 02:00:29.612
<i>- Not on any of it.</i>
- Hey, I'm not gonna fire you.

02:00:29.682 --> 02:00:32.708
Okay? Take a vacation. Now!

02:00:36.388 --> 02:00:40.017
<i>Lowell? Look, I've decided</i>
<i>to preface Sunday's show.</i>

02:00:40.092 --> 02:00:42.890
I did three minutes on the
<i>Evening News.</i> You'll want to see it.

02:00:42.961 --> 02:00:45.987
- Where are you going?
- I've been banished...

02:00:46.065 --> 02:00:49.296
<i>in lieu of being fired.</i>

02:00:49.368 --> 02:00:52.337
<i>I took off on Tisch.</i>
<i>I took off on Corporate.</i>

02:00:52.404 --> 02:00:55.032
They'll know they're not, uh, going
to see everything on Sunday night.

02:00:56.341 --> 02:00:59.572
I don't know. How does that
get Wigand on the air?

02:00:59.645 --> 02:01:01.772
Do me a favor,
will you? Spare me.

02:01:01.847 --> 02:01:04.315
For God's sake, get in the
real world. What do you think?

02:01:04.383 --> 02:01:07.978
I'm going to resign in protest
to force it on the air?

02:01:08.053 --> 02:01:10.954
The answer's no. I don't plan
to spend the end of my days...

02:01:11.023 --> 02:01:14.049
wandering in the wilderness
of National Public Radio.

02:01:14.126 --> 02:01:16.060
That decision
I've already made.

02:01:18.063 --> 02:01:20.463
<i> This Sunday,</i>
<i>Wallace will broadcast a report...</i>

02:01:20.532 --> 02:01:24.798
<i>on the tobacco industry,</i>
<i>including the tough tactics</i>
<i>tobacco companies employ...</i>

02:01:24.870 --> 02:01:27.668
to keep a lid on information
that might be damaging.

02:01:27.740 --> 02:01:30.538
Is there information
that people should have...

02:01:30.609 --> 02:01:34.943
that they're not going to have
because you're not going to
broadcast this interview?

02:01:35.013 --> 02:01:39.074
- Yes.
- Today, CBS News president
Eric Kluster...

02:01:39.151 --> 02:01:41.915
<i>defended the network's decision</i>
<i>not to broadcast...</i>

02:01:41.987 --> 02:01:44.956
<i>key portions</i>
<i>of the controversial interview.</i>

02:01:45.023 --> 02:01:47.821
<i>Mr. Kluster said, quote,</i>
<i>"The atmosphere is tougher than ever."</i>

02:01:47.893 --> 02:01:50.384
- Where's the rest?
- Dan.

02:01:50.462 --> 02:01:52.396
Where the hell's the rest?

02:01:52.464 --> 02:01:55.433
<i>- Nebraska football</i>

<i>Coming up in</i>
<i>Bernard Goldberg's America.</i>

02:01:58.470 --> 02:02:01.462
- You cut the guts out of what I said!
- It was a time consideration...

02:02:01.540 --> 02:02:04.373
Time? Bullshit!
You corporate lackey.

02:02:04.443 --> 02:02:08.277
Who told <i>you</i> your incompetent
little fingers have the
requisite skills to edit me?

02:02:08.347 --> 02:02:11.077
I'm trying to Band-Aid a situation
here, and you're too dim...

02:02:11.150 --> 02:02:13.516
Mike. Mike. Mike.

02:02:13.585 --> 02:02:17.612
"Mike"? Mike!

02:02:17.689 --> 02:02:19.486
Try "Mr. Wallace."

02:02:19.558 --> 02:02:23.426
We work in the same corporation. Doesn't
mean we work in the same profession.

02:02:23.495 --> 02:02:26.089
Now, now what are you going to do now?
You going to finesse me?

02:02:26.165 --> 02:02:30.499
Lawyer me some more? I've been
in this profession 50 fucking years!

02:02:30.569 --> 02:02:33.436
You and the people you work for
are destroying the most respected,

02:02:33.505 --> 02:02:36.474
the highest rated, the most
profitable show on this network.

02:02:52.524 --> 02:02:55.857
Here. These are
their leads, their sources.

02:02:55.928 --> 02:02:59.193
- I want you to have your reporters...
- Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.

02:02:59.264 --> 02:03:01.459
Have them make
their own calls.

02:03:01.533 --> 02:03:06.300
They'll find that these sources
have a different story than
the one that's in the dossier.

02:03:07.573 --> 02:03:09.507
Push the deadline,
Charlie.

02:03:14.746 --> 02:03:19.080
I'll push it for a week.
I want Milo and Suein to go through it.

02:03:33.332 --> 02:03:35.391
What do you want
to buy him for a gift?

02:03:35.467 --> 02:03:39.233
<i>Mmm, he's into</i>
<i>kind of little cars that, um...</i>

02:03:39.304 --> 02:03:41.534
- That remote control thing?
- Yeah.

02:03:41.607 --> 02:03:43.905
All right.
We'll go do that tomorrow.

02:03:43.976 --> 02:03:48.345
<i> The 63-36 vote was three</i>
<i>shy of the two-thirds needed to pass...</i>

02:03:48.413 --> 02:03:50.847
- Mom. There's Dad.
- Yes?

02:03:50.916 --> 02:03:54.317
<i>- On the TV.</i>
<i>- ... dating back to 1986.</i>

02:03:54.386 --> 02:03:56.547
The most recent trouble
for Wigand occurred here...

02:03:56.622 --> 02:03:58.749
And in local news,
WLKO, Louisville,

02:03:58.824 --> 02:04:01.418
has gained access
to a 500-page dossier...

02:04:01.493 --> 02:04:04.394
<i>on former Brown & Williamson</i>
<i>research head, Jeffrey Wigand,</i>

02:04:04.463 --> 02:04:08.331
<i>detailing charges of shoplifting</i>
<i>and failing to pay child support.</i>

02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:10.391
Wigand is currently teaching
chemistry and Japanese...

02:04:10.469 --> 02:04:12.403
<i>at the</i>
<i>DuPont Manual High School.</i>

02:04:12.471 --> 02:04:14.405
<i>Maria.</i>

02:04:36.060 --> 02:04:38.324
<i> Thousands of documents</i>
<i>from inside the tobacco industry...</i>

02:04:38.396 --> 02:04:40.489
<i>have surfaced</i>
<i>over the past year.</i>

02:04:40.564 --> 02:04:42.589
<i>Documents that</i>
<i>appear to confirm...</i>

02:04:42.667 --> 02:04:44.601
what a former
U.S. Surgeon general...

02:04:44.669 --> 02:04:48.537
and the current head of the Food and
Drug Administration have been saying.

02:04:48.606 --> 02:04:51.234
We learned of a tobacco insider
who could tell us...

02:04:51.309 --> 02:04:55.302
<i>whether or not the tobacco industry</i>
<i>has been leveling with the public.</i>

02:04:55.379 --> 02:04:57.313
<i>That insider was formerly...</i>

02:04:57.381 --> 02:05:00.316
<i>a highly-placed executive</i>
<i>with a tobacco company.</i>

02:05:00.384 --> 02:05:04.218
<i>But we cannot broadcast what critical</i>
<i>information about tobacco,</i>

02:05:04.288 --> 02:05:07.587
<i>addiction and public health</i>
<i>he might be able to offer.</i>

02:05:07.658 --> 02:05:11.492
<i>Why? Because he had to sign</i>
<i>a confidentiality agreement...</i>

02:05:11.562 --> 02:05:13.928
<i>with the tobacco company</i>
<i>he worked for.</i>

02:05:13.998 --> 02:05:17.126
<i>The management of CBS</i>
<i>has told us...</i>

02:05:17.201 --> 02:05:19.328
<i>that knowing</i>
<i>he had that agreement...</i>

02:05:19.403 --> 02:05:21.871
<i>if we were to broadcast</i>
<i>an interview with him,</i>

02:05:21.939 --> 02:05:25.898
<i>CBS could be faced with</i>
<i>a multi-billion dollar lawsuit.</i>

02:05:25.977 --> 02:05:29.606
<i>The fact is, we are not allowed</i>
<i>even to mention his name...</i>

02:05:29.680 --> 02:05:32.410
or the name of the company
he worked for.

02:05:32.483 --> 02:05:36.817
And, of course, we cannot
show you his face.

02:05:36.887 --> 02:05:39.981
And your confidentiality
agreement with...

02:05:40.057 --> 02:05:42.617
- Is still in force?
- Yes, it is.

02:05:42.693 --> 02:05:45.821
<i>So what are they gonna do?</i>
<i>Sue you for making this appearance?</i>

02:05:45.896 --> 02:05:48.262
<i>I would bet on it.</i>

02:05:48.332 --> 02:05:51.324
<i> The former executive</i>
<i>has reason to bet on being sued,</i>

02:05:51.402 --> 02:05:54.303
for major cigarette
manufacturers...

02:06:13.391 --> 02:06:16.360
Yeah.

02:06:16.427 --> 02:06:18.895
You disappeared on me.

02:06:18.963 --> 02:06:22.296
- How long you staying?
- I disappeared on you?

02:06:22.366 --> 02:06:25.028
All right.
What did you think?

02:06:26.103 --> 02:06:28.401
I think it was
a disgrace.

02:06:51.996 --> 02:06:55.727
- Still no answer.
- Get me the manager's office.

02:06:56.934 --> 02:06:59.198
David. David, you've got
a call on line four.

02:06:59.270 --> 02:07:02.330
I think you
better take it.

02:07:02.406 --> 02:07:04.397
This is David McDougal.
How can I help you?

02:07:04.475 --> 02:07:08.343
Mr. McDougal, my name is Lowell Bergman.
I'm a producer for <i>60 Minutes.</i>

02:07:08.412 --> 02:07:13.782
I'm concerned for a friend of mine
who's staying at your hotel right now.

02:07:20.424 --> 02:07:22.551
Mr. Wigand?

02:07:22.626 --> 02:07:24.560
Mr. Wigand?

02:07:30.201 --> 02:07:33.364
I-I think I need to call the police.
He won't respond.

02:07:33.437 --> 02:07:36.167
No, no, don't call the police. Just
tell him I'm on the phone with you.

02:07:36.240 --> 02:07:38.708
My name is Lowell Bergman.
Just tell him that.

02:07:38.776 --> 02:07:43.304
Mr. Wigand, Mr. Bergman
is on the telephone.

02:07:43.380 --> 02:07:45.871
Did he hear you?

02:07:45.950 --> 02:07:48.282
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.

02:07:48.352 --> 02:07:50.946
What about now?

02:07:51.021 --> 02:07:53.546
- What?
- Hello? Can you hear me now?

02:09:01.258 --> 02:09:05.160
- What's happening?
- He doesn't seem to be listening.

02:09:05.229 --> 02:09:09.131
All right. Now listen to me.
I want you... I want you to tell him...

02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:11.634
in these words:
Get on the fucking phone.

02:09:11.702 --> 02:09:13.966
I-I can't say that.

02:09:14.038 --> 02:09:16.563
No, you can. Tell him
to get on the fucking phone!

02:09:16.640 --> 02:09:19.734
He told me to tell you
to get on the... fucking phone!

02:09:25.749 --> 02:09:28.650
You manipulated me into this.

02:09:28.719 --> 02:09:30.983
- That's bullshit, Jeff.
- You greased the rails.

02:09:31.055 --> 02:09:35.185
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted
to say "yes." I helped him to say "yes."

02:09:35.259 --> 02:09:37.887
That's all.
You're not a robot, Jeff.

02:09:37.962 --> 02:09:40.897
- All right? You got a mind
of your own, don't you?
- " Up to you, Jeffrey.

02:09:40.965 --> 02:09:43.160
"That's the power you have,
Jeffrey.

02:09:43.234 --> 02:09:45.702
Vital inside information
the American public need to know."

02:09:45.769 --> 02:09:49.227
Lowell Bergman... the hotshot who never
met a source he couldn't turn around.

02:09:49.306 --> 02:09:51.501
I fought for you,
and I still fight for you!

02:09:51.575 --> 02:09:54.237
You fought for me?
You manipulated me...

02:09:54.311 --> 02:09:57.371
into where I am now... staring
at the Brown & Williamson building!

02:09:57.448 --> 02:10:00.645
It's all dark except the tenth floor.
That's the legal department.

02:10:00.718 --> 02:10:04.586
That's where they
fuck with my life.

02:10:07.691 --> 02:10:09.625
Jeffrey, where you going
with this?

02:10:11.262 --> 02:10:14.026
So, where you going?

02:10:18.202 --> 02:10:21.035
You are... important...

02:10:21.105 --> 02:10:24.006
to a lot of people,
Jeffrey.

02:10:24.074 --> 02:10:26.133
You think about that.

02:10:27.211 --> 02:10:29.145
You think about them.

02:10:42.226 --> 02:10:44.626
I'm running out
of heroes, man.

02:10:45.729 --> 02:10:47.856
Guys like you
are in short supply.

02:10:54.004 --> 02:10:55.938
Yeah, guys like you too.

02:11:00.711 --> 02:11:02.804
Where are you, anyway?

02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:07.408
I'm on a leave of absence.
Forced vacation.

02:11:09.586 --> 02:11:12.783
- You try and have a good time.
- Yeah.

02:11:12.856 --> 02:11:15.154
Yeah, I will.

02:11:29.307 --> 02:11:32.367
I'm Lowell Bergman. I'm from <i>60 Minutes.</i>
You know, you take the <i>60 Minutes...</i>

02:11:32.443 --> 02:11:34.968
out of that sentence,
nobody returns your phone calls.

02:11:36.247 --> 02:11:40.047
<i>Maybe Wigand's right.</i>
<i>Maybe I'm hooked.</i>

02:11:41.385 --> 02:11:43.319
What am I hooked on?

02:11:43.387 --> 02:11:45.651
The rush of <i>60 Minutes?</i>

02:11:45.723 --> 02:11:49.523
<i>What the hell for?</i>
<i>"Infotainment"!</i>

02:11:49.594 --> 02:11:51.858
It's so fucking useless,
all of it.

02:11:51.929 --> 02:11:55.660
So it's a big country with a free press.
You can go and work somewhere else.

02:11:55.733 --> 02:11:57.826
"Free press"?
The press is free.

02:11:57.902 --> 02:12:01.565
For anyone who owns one.
Larry Tisch has a free press.

02:12:01.639 --> 02:12:03.834
- Get some perspective, Lowell.
- I got perspective.

02:12:03.908 --> 02:12:05.899
No, you do not.

02:12:07.345 --> 02:12:09.836
From my perspective,

02:12:09.914 --> 02:12:13.816
what's been going on and what
I've been doing is ridiculous.

02:12:13.885 --> 02:12:16.217
- It's half-measures.
<i>- You're not listening.</i>

02:12:22.627 --> 02:12:25.619
Really know what you're
going to do before you do it.

02:13:07.271 --> 02:13:09.364
<i>I've got Richard Scruggs on the phone.</i>

02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:12.341
Patch him through.

02:13:12.410 --> 02:13:15.208
Well, Lowell, you are
not gonna believe this.

02:13:15.279 --> 02:13:19.579
The governor of Mississippi
is suing his own attorney general...

02:13:19.650 --> 02:13:23.245
to abandon litigation
against Big Tobacco.

02:13:23.321 --> 02:13:27.223
- Oh, good.
- But now that the version
without Jeff ran,

02:13:27.291 --> 02:13:30.624
what's the chance of getting
his interview on the air?

02:13:33.097 --> 02:13:35.190
- Hello?
- Yeah, I'm here.

02:13:35.266 --> 02:13:37.632
What chance is there of getting
Jeff's interview on the air?

02:13:37.702 --> 02:13:39.636
Less than great.

02:13:44.308 --> 02:13:46.606
I'd be lying to you
if I did not tell you...

02:13:46.677 --> 02:13:50.078
how important it was
in the court of public opinion.

02:13:50.147 --> 02:13:52.809
I'd be lying to you
if I didn't tell you...

02:13:52.883 --> 02:13:56.649
I'm about out of moves,
Dick.

02:13:58.889 --> 02:14:00.857
All right.
See ya.

02:14:23.014 --> 02:14:25.642
Hi.

02:14:27.385 --> 02:14:31.719
So, what are you folks
doing... here in Lincoln?

02:14:32.823 --> 02:14:36.816
- Geology survey.
- Geology?

02:14:36.894 --> 02:14:39.920
Yeah?
Really?

02:14:39.997 --> 02:14:41.931
How about you?

02:14:43.334 --> 02:14:45.894
I work for CBS News.

02:14:45.970 --> 02:14:48.461
Oh, yeah?

02:15:15.800 --> 02:15:18.360
Just ran into
two of your geologists.

02:15:18.436 --> 02:15:20.961
Geologists whose hands
aren't all chewed up.

02:15:21.038 --> 02:15:25.099
Lowell, do not...
screw this up.

02:15:25.176 --> 02:15:27.542
We are a week away
from an arrest.

02:15:27.611 --> 02:15:31.945
- So I'll hold it. And?
- We'll give you a heads-up
before we launch.

02:15:32.016 --> 02:15:34.507
- How long?
- Three hours.

02:15:34.585 --> 02:15:36.519
<i>You got a deal.</i>

02:15:51.836 --> 02:15:55.499
<i>... like the testimony before Congress</i>
<i>of Dr. Wigand's former boss,</i>

02:15:55.573 --> 02:15:59.339
<i>Brown & Williamson's chief</i>
<i>executive officer, Thomas Sandefur.</i>

02:15:59.410 --> 02:16:01.640
I believe that nicotine
is not addictive.

02:16:01.712 --> 02:16:04.203
I believe Mr. Sandefur
perjured himself...

02:16:04.281 --> 02:16:07.978
- because I watched those
testimonies very carefully.
- All of us did.

02:16:08.052 --> 02:16:10.247
There was this
whole line of people,

02:16:10.321 --> 02:16:12.846
whole line of C.E.O.'s
up there all swearing.

02:16:12.923 --> 02:16:16.017
Part of the reason I'm here
is that I felt...

02:16:16.093 --> 02:16:18.288
that their representation...

02:16:47.725 --> 02:16:49.659
...can be more rapidly absorbed
in the lung...

02:16:49.727 --> 02:16:51.853
and therefore affect the brain
and central nervous system.

02:17:16.554 --> 02:17:18.487
- Hello?
- Jim, it's Lowell.

02:17:18.556 --> 02:17:22.287
- Hey, where are you?
- Remember that night at P.J.'s?

02:17:22.359 --> 02:17:25.886
You asked me if we were
sitting on something explosive.
Well, we're not sitting on it.

02:17:25.963 --> 02:17:29.660
CBS Corporate leaned on CBS News,
which yanked an interview we did...

02:17:29.733 --> 02:17:33.691
with a top-ranking tobacco scientist,
corporate officer.

02:17:33.771 --> 02:17:35.830
They're trying to
close down the story.

02:17:35.906 --> 02:17:39.171
You mean, <i>60 Minutes</i>
is letting CBS Corporate...

02:17:39.243 --> 02:17:41.609
decide what is
or is not news?

02:17:41.679 --> 02:17:44.307
What's Wallace think
about this? Or Hewitt, or...

02:17:44.380 --> 02:17:46.508
How prominent?
What kind of placement?

02:17:46.584 --> 02:17:50.041
Oh, come on, Lowell. This is
<i>The New York Times.</i> I don't know.

02:17:50.120 --> 02:17:54.317
Well, until you do, all I can
tell you is what you already know.

02:17:54.391 --> 02:17:56.382
They will not
air an interview.

02:17:56.459 --> 02:17:58.860
Call me back in ten.

02:18:06.670 --> 02:18:08.968
- Hello?
- Debbie, it's me.

02:18:09.039 --> 02:18:11.473
Hi.
What time is it?

02:18:11.541 --> 02:18:15.568
- Oh, it's late.
- That I know. When are you coming back?

02:18:15.646 --> 02:18:18.410
I can't get out of here till
mid-morning. I'll be in tomorrow night.

02:18:18.482 --> 02:18:22.145
Listen, could you call a number
for me? It's in Mississippi.

02:18:22.218 --> 02:18:24.153
Okay.
Hold on a second.

02:18:26.590 --> 02:18:28.592
What is it?

02:18:34.431 --> 02:18:36.365
- Hello?
- It's Lowell.

02:18:36.433 --> 02:18:40.425
All right, Lowell. Page one.
Editorial's interested. Let's talk.

02:18:40.503 --> 02:18:44.906
Here's how it works. You ask me
questions. I tell you if you're wrong.

02:18:44.975 --> 02:18:49.241
- Lowell, you sure you want to do this?
- Why?

02:18:49.312 --> 02:18:52.873
Hey, it doesn't work,
you've burned your bridges, man.

02:18:52.949 --> 02:18:55.110
You ready?

02:18:55.184 --> 02:18:57.745
Okay.
About this whistle-blower,

02:18:57.821 --> 02:19:00.550
did Mike and Don go along
with the corporate decision?

02:19:02.691 --> 02:19:07.493
- Lowell?
- Did I tell you you were wrong?

02:19:07.564 --> 02:19:11.522
No. Um, I'm assuming
the cave-in begins...

02:19:11.601 --> 02:19:14.001
with the threat of litigation
from Big Tobacco.

02:19:14.070 --> 02:19:16.561
Are we talking, uh...

02:19:16.639 --> 02:19:19.507
Are we talking
Brown & Williamson here?

02:19:52.342 --> 02:19:54.401
Did I get you up?

02:19:54.477 --> 02:19:58.504
No, I usually sit around
my hotel room dressed like this
at 5:30 in the morning,

02:19:58.581 --> 02:20:00.515
sleepy look on my face.

02:20:02.552 --> 02:20:04.543
How many shows have
we done? Huh?

02:20:04.621 --> 02:20:06.714
- Come on. How many?
- Oh, lots.

02:20:06.790 --> 02:20:08.724
That's right.

02:20:10.660 --> 02:20:13.151
But in all that time,
Mike,

02:20:13.229 --> 02:20:16.027
did you ever get off a plane,
walk into a room...

02:20:16.099 --> 02:20:21.298
and find that a source
for a story changed his mind?

02:20:21.371 --> 02:20:23.669
Lost his heart?
Walked out on us?

02:20:23.740 --> 02:20:26.436
Not one fucking time.
You wanna know why?

02:20:26.509 --> 02:20:29.034
I see a rhetorical question
on the horizon.

02:20:29.112 --> 02:20:31.046
I'm gonna tell you why.

02:20:31.114 --> 02:20:34.572
Because when I tell someone
I'm gonna do something, I deliver.

02:20:34.651 --> 02:20:38.781
Oh, how fortunate I am to have
Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage...

02:20:38.855 --> 02:20:41.585
- to point me down the shining
path, to show me the way.
- Oh, please, Mike.

02:20:41.658 --> 02:20:43.922
- Give me a break.
- You give me a break.

02:20:43.993 --> 02:20:47.121
I never left a source
hung out to dry <i>ever.</i>

02:20:47.197 --> 02:20:50.098
Abandoned.
Not till right fucking now.

02:20:50.166 --> 02:20:53.897
When I came on this job,
I came with my word intact.

02:20:53.970 --> 02:20:57.929
I'm gonna leave with my word intact.
Fuck the rules of the game!

02:20:58.007 --> 02:20:59.941
Hell, you're supposed
to know me, Mike.

02:21:00.009 --> 02:21:02.102
What the hell
did you expect?

02:21:02.178 --> 02:21:04.840
You expect me to lie down?

02:21:04.914 --> 02:21:07.906
Back off?
Or get over it?

02:21:07.984 --> 02:21:12.182
In the real world, when you get to where
I am, there are other considerations.

02:21:12.255 --> 02:21:15.452
Like what?
Corporate responsibility?

02:21:15.525 --> 02:21:17.755
- What, are we talking celebrity here?
- I'm not...

02:21:17.827 --> 02:21:21.786
I'm not talking about
celebrity, vanity, CBS. I'm...

02:21:21.865 --> 02:21:23.799
I'm...
I'm talking about...

02:21:23.867 --> 02:21:27.997
when you're nearer the end
of your life than the beginning.

02:21:28.071 --> 02:21:31.802
And what do you think
you think about then? The future?

02:21:31.875 --> 02:21:34.537
"In the future, I'm gonna
do this, become that"?

02:21:34.611 --> 02:21:36.806
What future? No.

02:21:36.880 --> 02:21:39.781
What you think is...

02:21:39.849 --> 02:21:42.374
"How will I be regarded
in the end...

02:21:42.452 --> 02:21:46.047
after I'm gone?"

02:21:46.122 --> 02:21:50.081
Oh, along the way, I suppose
I made some minor impact.

02:21:50.160 --> 02:21:54.221
I did Irangate,
the Ayatollah, Malcolm X,

02:21:54.297 --> 02:21:57.061
Martin Luther King,
Saddam, Sadat, etc., etc.

02:21:57.133 --> 02:22:01.832
I showed them thieves in suits.
I spent a lifetime building...

02:22:01.905 --> 02:22:03.839
all that.

02:22:05.441 --> 02:22:10.777
But history only remembers most
what you did last.

02:22:10.847 --> 02:22:13.975
And should that be
fronting a segment...

02:22:14.050 --> 02:22:17.816
that allowed a tobacco giant
to crash this network...

02:22:24.027 --> 02:22:26.552
Does it give someone...

02:22:26.629 --> 02:22:31.931
at my time of life pause?

02:22:32.001 --> 02:22:33.935
Yeah.

02:22:40.877 --> 02:22:42.811
Mike,

02:22:44.581 --> 02:22:46.515
in my...

02:22:48.651 --> 02:22:51.814
You and I
have been doing this...

02:22:51.888 --> 02:22:55.722
together for 14 years.

02:22:57.360 --> 02:23:00.329
This is today's
<i>New York Times.</i>

02:23:00.396 --> 02:23:02.591
In it is the whole
sordid story...

02:23:02.665 --> 02:23:06.226
of what went on
inside our shop.

02:23:06.302 --> 02:23:10.830
And in the editorial,
it accuses us...

02:23:10.907 --> 02:23:13.876
of betraying the legacy
of Edward R. Murrow.

02:23:39.134 --> 02:23:41.898
They conclude most of it
seems pretty unsubstantiated.

02:23:51.046 --> 02:23:52.980
You're full of shit,
John.

02:24:03.625 --> 02:24:05.593
Yeah.

02:24:05.661 --> 02:24:08.357
<i>Front page. There's a picture of Wigand.</i>

02:24:08.430 --> 02:24:10.364
<i>Article's entitled,</i>
<i>"Getting Personal."</i>

02:24:12.501 --> 02:24:14.935
Wait. Hold on
a second, Lowell.

02:24:15.003 --> 02:24:16.868
Yeah.

02:24:21.376 --> 02:24:24.004
Yeah, I'll see
if I can find him.

02:24:24.079 --> 02:24:27.207
Yeah, hold on.
Don's looking for you.

02:24:27.282 --> 02:24:30.683
- Good.
- The subheading
is " Brown & Williamson...

02:24:30.752 --> 02:24:33.949
has a 500-page dossier
attacking chief critic."

02:24:34.022 --> 02:24:36.422
It quotes Richard Scruggs
calling it the worst kind...

02:24:36.491 --> 02:24:39.790
of an organized smear campaign
against a whistle-blower.

02:24:39.861 --> 02:24:43.353
"A close look at the file
and independent research
by this newspaper...

02:24:43.432 --> 02:24:46.731
"into its key claim indicates
that many of the serious allegations...

02:24:46.802 --> 02:24:52.104

scant or contradictory evidence."

02:25:11.526 --> 02:25:14.222

for caving
to corporate interests!

02:25:19.201 --> 02:25:23.160
<i>The New York Times</i> ran a
blow-by-blow of what we talked
about behind closed doors.

02:25:23.238 --> 02:25:25.968
- You fucked us!
- No! You fucked you!

02:25:26.041 --> 02:25:28.032
Don't invert stuff.

02:25:28.110 --> 02:25:30.943
Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand.
You bought it.

02:25:31.012 --> 02:25:33.947
The <i>Wall Street Journal...</i>
here... not exactly...

02:25:34.015 --> 02:25:36.711
a bastion of
anti-capitalist sentiment,

02:25:36.785 --> 02:25:39.345
refutes Big Tobacco's
smear campaign...

02:25:39.421 --> 02:25:42.857
as the lowest form
of character assassination.

02:25:42.924 --> 02:25:44.892
And now, even now,
when every word...

02:25:44.960 --> 02:25:47.952
of what Wigand has said
on our show is printed,

02:25:48.029 --> 02:25:51.658
the entire deposition
of his testimony in a court of law...

02:25:51.733 --> 02:25:53.894
in the state of Mississippi,

<i>totally</i> out of the bag,

02:25:56.738 --> 02:25:58.797
you're still

02:26:03.278 --> 02:26:05.678
Mike, you tell him.

02:26:05.747 --> 02:26:07.715
You fucked up, Don.

02:26:15.023 --> 02:26:18.049
It's old news. Stick with me,
like always. We'll be okay.

02:26:18.126 --> 02:26:21.220
These things have
a half-life of 15 minutes.

02:26:21.296 --> 02:26:25.289
No, that's fame.
Fame has a 15-minute half-life.

02:26:25.367 --> 02:26:27.335
Infamy lasts
a little longer.

02:26:27.402 --> 02:26:32.601
<i>We caved. It's foolish.</i>
<i>It's simply dead wrong.</i>

02:26:32.674 --> 02:26:36.576
Now this is what we're going to do.
We're going over to Black Rock...

02:26:40.315 --> 02:26:44.752
Okay? So let's get back to work.
Now what we saw there...

02:26:44.820 --> 02:26:47.448
<i>was two potassium chlorate...</i>

02:26:47.522 --> 02:26:52.687
would yield two potassium
chloride, also a solid...

02:27:02.737 --> 02:27:07.037
They cancelled the 6:00.
I don't know why. I...

02:27:07.108 --> 02:27:10.874
I'm on the 8:10.
I should be home... 9:30.

02:27:10.946 --> 02:27:13.414
I'll see you then.
I love you. Bye.

02:27:27.662 --> 02:27:29.630
- Oh. Thanks, Dad.
- Thanks.

02:27:42.277 --> 02:27:44.245
CBS management wouldn't
let us broadcast...

02:27:44.312 --> 02:27:47.804
our original story and our
interview with Jeffrey Wigand...

02:27:47.883 --> 02:27:50.283
because they were worried
about the possibility...

02:27:50.352 --> 02:27:53.253
of a multi-billion dollar
lawsuit against us...

02:27:53.321 --> 02:27:55.619
<i>for tortious interference.</i>

02:27:55.690 --> 02:27:57.885
<i>But now things have changed.</i>

02:27:57.959 --> 02:28:00.757
<i>What Dr. Wigand told us</i>
<i>was that his former...</i>

02:28:29.958 --> 02:28:32.893
<i> This industry,</i>
<i>in my opinion, is an industry...</i>

02:28:32.961 --> 02:28:36.920
that has perpetrated the biggest fraud

02:29:05.560 --> 02:29:09.894
Yeah, there are times
I wish I hadn't done it.

02:29:09.965 --> 02:29:15.130
There are times I feel com...
compelled to do it.

02:29:15.203 --> 02:29:17.137
If you ask me...

02:29:17.205 --> 02:29:20.197
would I do it again,
do I think it's worth it?

02:29:23.144 --> 02:29:25.078
Yeah, I think it's worth it.

02:29:30.652 --> 02:29:34.418
I promised you a three-hour
heads up. Here it is.

02:29:34.489 --> 02:29:37.925
Have a camera crew standing by
in Helena, Montana on Tuesday,

02:29:37.993 --> 02:29:39.927
and I'll give you
a three-hour head start.

02:29:39.995 --> 02:29:43.362
All right? By the way, that was
a hell of a good show tonight.

02:29:43.431 --> 02:29:45.422
- Thank you, Bill.
- Yeah.

02:30:04.819 --> 02:30:08.084

02:30:08.156 --> 02:30:10.090
Yeah.
