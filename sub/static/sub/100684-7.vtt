WEBVTT

00:03.177 --> 00:05.918
Guys, come on! Chels, Felix.

00:05.962 --> 00:07.964
What's going on?

00:08.008 --> 00:09.835
I made breakfast.

00:09.879 --> 00:11.185
Morning, Benjamin.What?

00:11.228 --> 00:12.751
I made you breakfast.

00:12.795 --> 00:16.712
No, I heard you.
I'm... I'm surprised.

00:16.755 --> 00:18.757
You've been letting me
stay here for free.

00:18.801 --> 00:20.759
You gave me a job.

00:20.803 --> 00:25.634
It's just my way of
saying... thank you,

00:25.677 --> 00:26.983
or-or whatever.Thank you.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.550
Looks delicious.

00:28.593 --> 00:30.204
Yeah. No problem.

00:30.247 --> 00:32.119
Hey, are you not gonna
eat with us?

00:32.162 --> 00:34.121
Oh, I ate when
I got up.

00:34.164 --> 00:36.732
Yeah, this is, uh,
it's just for you guys.

00:36.775 --> 00:39.648
I am going to jump
in the shower, though.

00:39.691 --> 00:41.389
That was really decent of you.

00:41.432 --> 00:43.478
Chels, don't.
What?

00:45.436 --> 00:46.524
Yum!

00:46.568 --> 00:49.092
This is a real twist, huh?
[chuckles]

00:51.486 --> 00:52.661
Oh, my God, are you okay?Yeah.

00:52.704 --> 00:53.879
No, I'm fine, I'm good.

00:53.923 --> 00:56.056
I'm actually really good.

00:56.099 --> 00:57.883
I'm... [laughs softly]

01:00.147 --> 01:02.714
My brother's come a long way,
and I think his sobriety

01:02.758 --> 01:04.281
might actually stick this time.

01:04.325 --> 01:08.285
Oh, I-I...
I didn't know, um...

01:08.329 --> 01:09.504
Don't say anything.

01:09.547 --> 01:11.332
Like, it's-it's a very
touchy subject.

01:11.375 --> 01:13.247
Nobody in my family talks to him
anymore because of it.

01:13.290 --> 01:15.379
Really? That's not cool.

01:15.423 --> 01:16.685
No, I get it.

01:16.728 --> 01:18.513
Uh, my mom died of cancer.

01:18.556 --> 01:20.341
I don't think--
I don't think you know that.

01:20.384 --> 01:21.820
I'm so sorry.

01:21.864 --> 01:23.083
It's okay, it
was years ago.

01:23.126 --> 01:25.433
Um...

01:27.043 --> 01:29.741
Anyway, at the end, she was

01:29.785 --> 01:31.700
in an insane amount of pain,

01:31.743 --> 01:33.310
like an unbearable amount
of pain.

01:33.354 --> 01:34.616
And the doctors couldn't

01:34.659 --> 01:35.747
figure out why.

01:35.791 --> 01:37.836
And it turns out
that Ben was

01:37.880 --> 01:41.492
stealing her pain meds and
replacing them with vitamin C.

01:41.536 --> 01:43.320
Oh, my God.

01:43.364 --> 01:45.975
Yeah. I mean,
addiction's a bad disease.

01:46.018 --> 01:47.977
Yeah.

01:48.020 --> 01:50.153
Hey, please don't
judge him. Okay?

01:50.197 --> 01:52.329
I've forgiven him for
everything, and I wish the rest

01:52.373 --> 01:53.852
of my family
would do the same.

01:53.896 --> 01:57.204
I mean, he's a completely
different person now. Okay?

01:57.247 --> 01:59.380
I'm really, really proud of him.

02:04.733 --> 02:06.735
♪

02:15.700 --> 02:17.137
Hey there.
Felix Bell.

02:17.180 --> 02:19.095
I don't know if we've been,
like, formally introduced,

02:19.139 --> 02:21.663
actually, so, um, but
ver-very nice to meet you.

02:21.706 --> 02:22.620
What is this?

02:22.664 --> 02:25.145
He's cool.

02:28.235 --> 02:30.062
So you change your mind
about turning on Nia?

02:30.106 --> 02:32.674
Yeah.

02:32.717 --> 02:35.067
When you try and kill
my best friend,

02:35.111 --> 02:37.418
I'm not really gonna want
to work for you anymore.

02:37.461 --> 02:39.681
I feel you.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.164
So, what's the...
what's the secret plan?

02:47.993 --> 02:49.212
She told you, I'm cool.

02:49.256 --> 02:52.259
All right.

02:52.302 --> 02:56.001
There's this dude, Josiah,
who's closing in on Nia.

02:56.045 --> 02:57.699
I'm gonna help him
take over her territory

02:57.742 --> 03:00.136
little by little till
she has nothing left.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.834
You said we were gonna
destroy her.

03:02.878 --> 03:05.272
That's what we're doing.
I'm gonna feed Josiah

03:05.315 --> 03:07.187
Nia's product, but only after
we get all of it

03:07.230 --> 03:08.449
out of Guiding Hope.

03:08.492 --> 03:11.234
My boy Trey told me
he's losing his patience,

03:11.278 --> 03:12.670
so we gotta get this done.

03:12.714 --> 03:14.585
Why can't Felix just
give you the code to the safe,

03:14.629 --> 03:16.152
and you give it all to him now?

03:16.196 --> 03:18.981
Nah. If Nia finds out what
you're holding's gone missing,

03:19.024 --> 03:20.200
she'll come after you guys.

03:20.243 --> 03:21.462
We need to make her realize

03:21.505 --> 03:23.899
Guiding Hope isn't a good fit
for her operation

03:23.942 --> 03:25.205
so she'll move everything out.

03:25.248 --> 03:27.076
Then we can get it to Josiah.

03:27.119 --> 03:29.034
I need you guys
to play it cool.

03:29.078 --> 03:31.385
Meantime, I'm gonna find her
a better stash house

03:31.428 --> 03:32.864
and convince her to move it.

03:32.908 --> 03:34.997
Okay.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.259
What are we supposed to do?

03:36.303 --> 03:38.043
Nothing. Don't do anything.

03:38.087 --> 03:41.221
But we have a drop today.

03:41.264 --> 03:43.875
Tell 'em you can't do it,
that there's too many

03:43.919 --> 03:46.138
people around. I don't
want you guys looking good

03:46.182 --> 03:48.489
while I'm trying to convince her
to move her stuff out.

03:48.532 --> 03:52.101
Okay, so you basically
brought us all the way here

03:52.144 --> 03:54.451
just to tell us
to do nothing?

03:54.495 --> 03:57.193
Yeah, well, you're... you.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.673
And I need this to go smooth.

03:58.716 --> 04:01.110
I got it.

04:09.031 --> 04:10.815
My wife paid, Parish.

04:10.859 --> 04:13.383
I'm getting it, okay?
Swear to God.

04:13.427 --> 04:14.732
[grunts]

04:14.776 --> 04:17.213
You better get it to me.

04:19.955 --> 04:22.914
All right, you almost done?
We gotta go.

04:22.958 --> 04:25.395
All my friends get to stay home

04:25.439 --> 04:27.397
on parent-teacher
conference days.

04:27.441 --> 04:31.140
Well, not you, because
you are grounded.

04:31.183 --> 04:33.316
So you're coming
to work with me

04:33.360 --> 04:35.100
until Grandma can
pick you up.

04:37.842 --> 04:40.367
Why did Murphy say
all that stuff last night?

04:40.410 --> 04:42.804
What stuff?

04:42.847 --> 04:47.069
The stuff about you
getting away with murder.

04:51.900 --> 04:56.339
Look, Murphy is an alcoholic.

04:56.383 --> 04:58.385
And I am starting to think

04:58.428 --> 05:01.388
a pathological liar.

05:01.431 --> 05:03.825
She's not right in the head.

05:03.868 --> 05:07.394
Which-which is why I don't...
I don't want you around her.

05:07.437 --> 05:11.398
Now, get your boots on.
I can't be late.

05:11.441 --> 05:13.661
Jess hasn't responded
to any of my texts.

05:13.704 --> 05:15.315
Is she talking to you?

05:15.358 --> 05:17.099
She literally hasn't
said a word to me

05:17.142 --> 05:18.318
in the last 12 hours.

05:18.361 --> 05:20.320
[sighs]

05:20.363 --> 05:21.756
Cool!

05:21.799 --> 05:23.671
Like... [scoffs]

05:30.155 --> 05:32.506
So how are we supposed
to include her if she--

05:32.549 --> 05:34.769
Hey, Benjamin.

05:36.597 --> 05:38.076
Thanks again for that
yummy breakfast.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.340
That was delightful.

05:40.383 --> 05:42.342
Okay.

05:48.957 --> 05:51.220
It's like, how are we-- Hey...

05:51.263 --> 05:53.353
Jess.

05:55.877 --> 05:57.008
Are you feeling
any better?

05:57.052 --> 05:58.836
Don't.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.839
Come on, Jess, you know
the silent treatment is

06:01.883 --> 06:03.885
particularly mean
to blind people.

06:12.110 --> 06:14.896
Hi.

06:14.939 --> 06:16.114
Hey.

06:16.158 --> 06:19.988
Wh-What's up?

06:20.031 --> 06:22.469
Uh, nothing. Um...

06:22.512 --> 06:27.387
What?
I was just, um...

06:27.430 --> 06:29.954
I-I was just...

06:31.956 --> 06:35.177
Look, when we met, um,
I wasn't looking for this.

06:35.220 --> 06:37.527
Like, a relationship
or whatever.

06:41.749 --> 06:44.708
Oh, okay. Yeah...

06:44.752 --> 06:46.144
[chuckles]
I didn't--

06:46.188 --> 06:47.668
I didn't think we were
in a relationship.

06:47.711 --> 06:50.192
I just thought we were
hanging out.

06:50.235 --> 06:53.108
Right, well, um, we-we
hang out every day.

06:53.151 --> 06:54.326
I know. Yeah.

06:54.370 --> 06:55.458
We don't have to--
we don't have to do that.

06:55.502 --> 06:56.677
We can just--
we can take things slow.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.418
I just...
Mm-hmm?

06:58.461 --> 07:03.423
I just don't think
this is gonna work.

07:10.212 --> 07:12.127
Okay.

07:14.651 --> 07:17.262
Okay, um...

07:19.526 --> 07:23.617
Hey, Sterling, uh...

07:23.660 --> 07:26.707
You know what, actually,
I think-- do you...

07:29.274 --> 07:31.233
C-Can you maybe,
like, not be here?

07:31.276 --> 07:33.148
Can you leave for the day?
Could you go talk to Felix

07:33.191 --> 07:34.497
and tell him you're
sick or something?

07:34.541 --> 07:36.630
I just...

07:36.673 --> 07:40.242
I need space. Please.

07:40.285 --> 07:43.288
Um...

07:43.332 --> 07:46.074
This has nothing to do...

07:46.117 --> 07:48.119
With me.

07:49.556 --> 07:51.079
Right.

07:51.122 --> 07:54.125
[laughs]

07:54.169 --> 07:55.779
Thank you.

08:04.571 --> 08:06.573
[hyperventilating]

08:27.811 --> 08:29.813
[hyperventilating continues]

08:33.600 --> 08:35.602
[breathing slows, steadies]

08:38.430 --> 08:40.781
This can't happen again.

08:40.824 --> 08:42.043
When do you want me to hit back?

08:42.086 --> 08:43.566
His guys are loyal
to a fault.

08:43.610 --> 08:45.829
If you hit Josiah, you're dead.

08:45.873 --> 08:48.136
Josiah's almost
out of product.

08:48.179 --> 08:49.572
When we get that shipment
from Mateo next week,

08:49.616 --> 08:51.574
he'll be completely choked off.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.837
Meantime, find me another way
into that prison.[phone vibrating]

08:57.232 --> 08:58.363
Yeah?

08:58.407 --> 09:00.583
Hey, it's-it's Murphy.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.716
Um, I know we're supposed to
make a drop today,

09:02.759 --> 09:04.848
but there's just
a lot of people here,

09:04.892 --> 09:06.197
and I'm thinking it might be...

09:06.241 --> 09:08.112
It's off.Oh.

09:08.156 --> 09:09.766
What happened?

09:09.810 --> 09:12.552
We lost our way into the prison.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.249
We were supplying the prison?

09:14.292 --> 09:17.905
Yeah. Where did you think?

09:17.948 --> 09:20.734
Um, I-I didn't, I guess.

09:20.777 --> 09:23.606
I don't know,
I-I didn't think about it.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.434
All right, bye.

09:28.698 --> 09:30.221
Call "Max Cellmate."

09:30.265 --> 09:32.397
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Calling Max Cellmate.

09:32.441 --> 09:34.399
[phone vibrates]

09:34.443 --> 09:36.271
Hello?

09:36.314 --> 09:37.925
Can I talk to Max?

09:37.968 --> 09:39.796
He's in the infirmary
getting stitched up.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.189
He got jumped.

09:41.232 --> 09:43.321
What? Why?

09:43.365 --> 09:44.322
Why you think?

09:44.366 --> 09:46.368
He owes stuff to, like, 20 guys.

09:46.411 --> 09:48.936
You know who he's working for?

09:48.979 --> 09:51.199
He's gonna need a delivery,
like, now.

09:51.242 --> 09:53.767
[buzzing in distance]I gotta go.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.255
The whole reason you
put the drugs in here
is to keep Max safe.

10:04.299 --> 10:07.389
Now Max...
definitely not safe.

10:07.432 --> 10:09.783
Yes, the irony is not
lost on me.

10:09.826 --> 10:12.263
Now, I...

10:12.307 --> 10:15.658
What? Go ahead.

10:15.702 --> 10:18.008
No.

10:18.052 --> 10:19.749
Say "I told you so,"

10:19.793 --> 10:21.272
and I'll just punch you
in the face.

10:21.316 --> 10:22.796
Did I say that?

10:24.536 --> 10:26.669
Murphy?

10:26.713 --> 10:28.802
Okay.

10:28.845 --> 10:30.847
Come on.
Let's hear it.

10:31.892 --> 10:33.197
Hear what?

10:33.241 --> 10:36.200
You're gonna tell me
some insane idea

10:36.244 --> 10:39.900
to get drugs to Max,
so... bring it on.

10:40.944 --> 10:43.468
Wait, you think we can do that?

10:43.512 --> 10:44.992
No.

10:45.035 --> 10:47.037
No!

10:49.083 --> 10:51.041
[moans]

10:51.085 --> 10:53.435
Why do I talk?
Why do I ever talk?

10:53.478 --> 10:55.785
Smoked my first cigarette
last year. Now look at me.

10:55.829 --> 10:57.308
Shh.
Shh?

10:57.352 --> 11:00.137
Shh.Shh! You heard Darnell.

11:00.181 --> 11:01.704
"Don't do anything."

11:01.748 --> 11:03.619
Literally, that was
his only instruction.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.186
It's fine because
no one's gonna know.

11:06.535 --> 11:07.884
Is it working?

11:07.928 --> 11:09.625
Oh, God, it is.Let me see.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.323
This will definitely fit
in Max's waistband.

11:12.367 --> 11:13.585
Here.

11:15.631 --> 11:17.720
[sighs]

11:17.764 --> 11:19.461
You're a genius.

11:19.504 --> 11:20.723
Hmm.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.420
You still have a
long way to go.

11:23.378 --> 11:26.033
Now you need
to contact Max, okay?

11:26.076 --> 11:27.512
His cellmate gave
me his number.

11:27.556 --> 11:29.514
What am I supposed to say?

11:29.558 --> 11:31.821
Just pretend you're one of
Nia's guys and tell him

11:31.865 --> 11:33.693
he has to be at
visitation today.

11:34.781 --> 11:37.174
[sighs]:
Okay. Um...

11:37.218 --> 11:40.351
"Meet your
new supplier..."

11:40.395 --> 11:41.570
Yeah.

11:41.613 --> 11:44.399
"...at visitation.

11:44.442 --> 11:47.576
Or else."Or else?

11:47.619 --> 11:49.926
I don't know, Murphy. I've never
sent a threatening text before.

11:49.970 --> 11:51.362
It's not a threatening text,
you dumbass.

11:51.406 --> 11:55.149
Just say, "Be at visitation
today for a drop-off."

11:55.192 --> 11:57.412
"Be at visitation today
for a drop-off."

11:57.455 --> 11:58.674
[door handle rattles]

11:58.718 --> 12:00.545
[dogs barking]

12:02.286 --> 12:03.418
[knocking on door]

12:03.461 --> 12:05.333
FELIX:
One second!

12:13.776 --> 12:15.735
Jess. Hey, what's up?

12:17.867 --> 12:19.956
JESS:
You know, it's one thing
to store heroin here,

12:20.000 --> 12:21.175
but it's another thing

12:21.218 --> 12:23.655
to steal medication
for sick dogs.

12:24.656 --> 12:26.136
[laughs]:
Wha...

12:26.180 --> 12:27.572
What are you talking about?

12:27.616 --> 12:29.400
Oh, you know the key
to my medicine cabinet?

12:29.444 --> 12:31.228
Yesterday,
it-it went missing.

12:31.272 --> 12:34.318
And then today, it just
mysteriously showed up,

12:34.362 --> 12:37.017
and all the opioids
are gone, so...

12:37.060 --> 12:40.194
I swear to God,
we didn't touch anything.

12:40.237 --> 12:43.414
I-I have no energy to hear
any more lies from you two.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.025
We're not lying.Shut up,

12:45.068 --> 12:46.722
Murphy.

12:48.463 --> 12:50.030
S-She left.

12:50.073 --> 12:52.075
I heard her, Felix.

12:55.862 --> 12:58.821
You think someone
really stole her opioids?

12:58.865 --> 13:00.257
I don't know,

13:00.301 --> 13:02.085
but she didn't misplace them,
so I don't,

13:02.129 --> 13:04.261
I don't know who would
do that. [sniffles]

13:04.305 --> 13:05.523
Hmm.

13:08.962 --> 13:10.746
Oh, my God.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.704
What?

13:12.748 --> 13:15.359
Oh, my God.
What?

13:16.317 --> 13:17.753
I think it was Ben.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.321
Chelsea told me he used to be
an addict, and he looks...

13:22.540 --> 13:23.715
...pretty high.Felix.

13:23.759 --> 13:25.152
You hired an addict?

13:25.195 --> 13:27.981
I obviously didn't know.
She just told me.

13:29.896 --> 13:32.333
I don't know. Maybe
he's just... sleepy.

13:32.376 --> 13:34.248
Ugh, it's seriously
so hard to tell.

13:34.291 --> 13:36.163
Just ask him.
You'll know if he's lying.

13:36.206 --> 13:39.166
No, no, no. I-I can't do that.

13:39.209 --> 13:40.645
Um, so we have
a lot of drugs here.

13:40.689 --> 13:43.344
If he's stealing pills,
he cannot work here.

13:43.387 --> 13:46.216
So grow a pair
and go talk to him.

13:46.260 --> 13:49.045
Okay-- I'll-I'll do it after
we get back from the prison.

13:49.089 --> 13:52.309
No. Visitation's not
for another hour. Do it now.

13:52.353 --> 13:53.876
No. No.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.182
Fine. I'll help you.No, Murphy...

13:55.225 --> 13:56.661
You have a lot of straws to do,

13:56.705 --> 13:57.967
so you're gonna
get this over with.Murphy. Murphy.

13:58.011 --> 14:00.883
Murphy, wait. Murphy.

14:00.927 --> 14:02.058
[whispers]:
Wait.

14:02.102 --> 14:03.277
[Murphy slaps desk]

14:03.320 --> 14:05.061
Felix wants to see you.

14:07.890 --> 14:10.153
[knocking on door]Oh, hey.

14:10.197 --> 14:12.068
How's it going?

14:12.112 --> 14:14.462
Uh, fine.

14:14.505 --> 14:16.899
You want to have a seat?

14:16.943 --> 14:19.249
What-What's up?

14:19.293 --> 14:23.340
Um, how you feeling?

14:23.384 --> 14:25.255
Great.

14:25.299 --> 14:28.041
Oh, I just wanted to ask,

14:28.084 --> 14:32.088
there were some, uh, dog drugs--
well, painkillers--

14:32.132 --> 14:33.481
uh, missing,

14:33.524 --> 14:36.092
and I just,

14:36.136 --> 14:38.486
uh...

14:38.529 --> 14:40.314
You think it was me?

14:40.357 --> 14:41.489
No, no, no, no. No. No.

14:41.532 --> 14:42.707
Definitely not. I just...

14:42.751 --> 14:45.275
My stupid sister told you,
didn't she?

14:45.319 --> 14:46.711
No. What? I don't...

14:46.755 --> 14:48.670
No. She didn't
tell me anything.

14:48.713 --> 14:50.280
Okay.

14:50.324 --> 14:52.282
I'm asking everyone.Yeah?

14:52.326 --> 14:54.328
Who else did you ask?

14:55.503 --> 14:57.722
W-Well, technically, you were...

14:57.766 --> 15:00.987
Look, it wasn't me, man. Okay?

15:01.030 --> 15:02.423
I'm sober.

15:05.643 --> 15:07.036
92 days.

15:08.733 --> 15:10.692
I didn't...

15:10.735 --> 15:13.434
Yeah, it's okay.
Just sucks, you know?

15:13.477 --> 15:14.957
I don't want to be the person

15:15.001 --> 15:17.829
that people think of first
when some drugs go missing.

15:17.873 --> 15:19.005
It's like...

15:19.048 --> 15:20.441
I'm sorry.

15:20.484 --> 15:21.572
It's fine.

15:21.616 --> 15:23.792
Just pretend that, you know--

15:23.835 --> 15:26.447
'cause honest--
I'm very... supportive.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.275
Of that, of what you're doing.

15:28.318 --> 15:30.712
Hey.

15:30.755 --> 15:33.889
Oh. Hey.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.847
CHLOE:
Yeah, Dad?

15:35.891 --> 15:38.285
Oh, no, I'm-I'm actually
just looking for him.

15:38.328 --> 15:40.591
Oh. He just ran to the bathroom.

15:40.635 --> 15:42.985
Ah, cool, coo--
I'm-I'm Gene, by the way.

15:43.029 --> 15:44.726
I'm your dad's new partner.Oh.

15:44.769 --> 15:46.249
Hi. It's nice to meet you.

15:46.293 --> 15:48.643
Yeah. I've-I've heard
a lot about you.

15:48.686 --> 15:51.863
Really? He hasn't
really mentioned you.

15:51.907 --> 15:54.431
Oh. That hurts, Chloe.

15:54.475 --> 15:55.824
That-that hurts bad.

15:55.867 --> 15:57.652
[chuckles]:
I didn't mean it
like that.

15:57.695 --> 16:00.133
I think he just misses
his old partner.

16:00.176 --> 16:03.223
Yeah. Yeah, no,
I heard about the death. Uh...

16:03.266 --> 16:05.225
That must have been
really, really hard.

16:06.443 --> 16:09.185
My dad told me
she got transferred.

16:10.186 --> 16:11.753
Right. Yeah.

16:11.796 --> 16:13.755
Mm, I don't know.

16:13.798 --> 16:15.626
I probably had
my wires crossed.

16:15.670 --> 16:17.977
Hey.Dean, there he is.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.152
My man.Where you been?

16:19.195 --> 16:22.024
Uh, trying to be a hero.

16:22.068 --> 16:23.373
Spent three hours trying
to get that truck driver

16:23.417 --> 16:25.375
we busted to flip on Nia.

16:25.419 --> 16:26.507
She still won't budge.

16:26.550 --> 16:27.551
Maybe we'll have
a little more luck

16:27.595 --> 16:29.075
with who she was delivering to.

16:29.118 --> 16:30.772
So you want to see if Parish
has access to the kitchen?

16:30.815 --> 16:32.339
Okay.

16:32.382 --> 16:33.644
All right.
Want to get a bite?

16:33.688 --> 16:35.385
Like, all three of us?

16:38.301 --> 16:39.563
Yeah. Okay.

16:39.607 --> 16:42.566
Hey.

16:42.610 --> 16:44.133
Hello.

16:44.177 --> 16:45.961
I was supposed
to grab lunch with Felix

16:46.005 --> 16:47.528
before my shift,
but he's...

16:47.571 --> 16:50.226
He just left with Murphy.
They're probably banging.

16:50.270 --> 16:51.793
Tough break.
Shut up, Ben.

16:51.836 --> 16:53.360
He texted me that he had a work
thing and he had to cancel,

16:53.403 --> 16:56.406
but since I was almost here,
I thought I would eat with you.

16:56.450 --> 16:58.800
We should go to a bar instead.

16:58.843 --> 17:01.020
That's not funny.All I am to you

17:01.063 --> 17:04.414
is an addict, so at the very
least, I could be drinking.

17:05.502 --> 17:06.677
What are you talking about?

17:06.721 --> 17:09.419
You told Felix? Chels.

17:09.463 --> 17:12.466
What I was saying
was how proud I am of you.

17:12.509 --> 17:13.989
And how you've
completely turned around.

17:14.033 --> 17:17.471
Then why did he accuse me
of stealing dog painkillers?

17:17.514 --> 17:18.689
He what?

17:19.734 --> 17:21.388
I'm just, I'm over this.

17:21.431 --> 17:26.262
I am over feeling like a pile
of trash every waking moment.

17:26.306 --> 17:28.525
I'll see you later.

17:37.969 --> 17:40.929
Why are you being so quiet?
You're freaking me out.

17:40.972 --> 17:43.149
I'm sorry, it's just...

17:43.192 --> 17:45.151
one more thing I could
get arrested for.

17:45.194 --> 17:46.456
Obviously, you would
take the brunt of it.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.719
Can you stop, please?Sorry.

17:48.763 --> 17:50.547
[sighs]

17:50.591 --> 17:53.202
Okay. Is Pretzel good to go?

17:53.246 --> 17:55.813
Yeah, he's good.

17:55.857 --> 17:59.730
I guess this is where
I leave you guys.

17:59.774 --> 18:03.169
I can't wait here.
There's too many guards.

18:03.212 --> 18:05.519
Just pick us up in an hour.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.047
Wait, wait, no.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.657
No. You wouldn't hug me

18:13.701 --> 18:15.181
unless you thought
I was gonna get caught.

18:15.224 --> 18:17.313
No, that's not true. No, it
was just a-a good luck hug.

18:17.357 --> 18:18.532
Just in case.

18:18.575 --> 18:20.229
Not that you need luck,
but you know.

18:20.273 --> 18:22.188
In case. You'll be fine,
probably.

18:22.231 --> 18:25.060
They're not gonna check
Pretzel's vest.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.715
They didn't last time
I brought him.

18:28.716 --> 18:30.021
Okay.

18:30.065 --> 18:32.502
Bye.

18:32.546 --> 18:34.374
Let's go, Pretzel.

18:37.551 --> 18:41.598
Come on. Good boy.

18:43.470 --> 18:45.472
[phone vibrating]

18:45.515 --> 18:47.604
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Text from Darnell.

18:49.084 --> 18:50.216
Going to talk to Nia.

18:50.259 --> 18:52.609
All good on your end?

18:52.653 --> 18:54.655
[clears throat]
Uh, yep.

18:54.698 --> 18:57.614
All good here.

18:57.658 --> 18:59.573
Next.
Forward.

19:03.098 --> 19:04.186
Uh, I'm here to see Max Parish.

19:09.583 --> 19:10.758
Surprise.

19:10.801 --> 19:12.499
What are you doing here?

19:12.542 --> 19:16.851
I had some time to kill, and
I know I missed our lunch, so...

19:16.894 --> 19:21.508
I brought you... a sandwich.

19:22.596 --> 19:25.555
Okay. You hate sandwiches.

19:27.862 --> 19:30.430
Are you okay? What's going on?

19:35.826 --> 19:37.393
Chels, what's going on?

19:37.437 --> 19:40.004
You accused Ben
of stealing dog drugs?

19:40.048 --> 19:43.791
Okay. Yes.

19:43.834 --> 19:46.359
There-- I--
there were some missing,

19:46.402 --> 19:48.230
and I jumped to conclusions.

19:48.274 --> 19:49.710
I trusted you with, like,
sensitive information

19:49.753 --> 19:51.712
about my family because
I thought we were at that place.

19:51.755 --> 19:54.367
I know, I know. I'm so sorry.

19:54.410 --> 19:56.804
I panicked and...

19:56.847 --> 19:58.632
Look, I can't even look at you.

19:58.675 --> 20:00.416
Wait, hold on.Can you just go?

20:00.460 --> 20:02.679
Wait, hold on.Take your dumb
sandwich with you.

20:05.813 --> 20:07.031
[door closes]

20:09.643 --> 20:10.818
GUARD:
Next.

20:10.861 --> 20:12.863
Forward.

20:15.692 --> 20:17.825
No pets allowed.

20:17.868 --> 20:20.044
He's a service animal.

20:20.088 --> 20:22.090
Sorry, no animals.

20:22.133 --> 20:23.831
You can leave
him with me.

20:23.874 --> 20:27.269
Since when?
I-I've taken him in before.

20:27.313 --> 20:29.576
Then someone wasn't
doing their job.

20:29.619 --> 20:32.056
I don't know what to tell you.

20:32.100 --> 20:35.843
Well, can I, can I just quickly
take him to the restroom, then?

20:35.886 --> 20:39.063
Or I can just guess
where the toilet is.

20:39.107 --> 20:41.588
DARNELL:
Here's what I'm thinking.
For this district,

20:41.631 --> 20:44.068
we rent a house on the app, move
our stuff in for a couple days,

20:44.112 --> 20:45.635
then we move on.

20:45.679 --> 20:48.159
Cleaning crew contaminates any
usable evidence left behind.

20:48.203 --> 20:51.032
A mobile stash house?

20:51.075 --> 20:54.601
It's smart, Darnell.

20:54.644 --> 20:57.560
What about transport?

20:57.604 --> 20:59.780
That's a lot of moving product
around for us.

20:59.823 --> 21:03.914
Safer than where
it's at right now.

21:03.958 --> 21:07.266
Nia, real talk,
what are we doing there?

21:07.309 --> 21:10.312
It's a guide dog school.
There's no security.

21:10.356 --> 21:12.314
There's people coming
in and out. It's weak.

21:14.316 --> 21:16.275
[panting]

21:18.102 --> 21:20.757
And Murphy...

21:28.504 --> 21:30.376
...she's messy.

21:43.519 --> 21:46.000
She doesn't know
what she's doing.

21:46.043 --> 21:48.263
She can't even
take care of herself.

21:51.484 --> 21:54.704
And she's holding your product
when we're on the ropes?

21:59.318 --> 22:02.364
You and I both know we need
to get it out of there.

22:04.235 --> 22:06.803
[lock buzzes]

22:11.852 --> 22:15.246
With Josiah closing in, we got
to make the smart play here,

22:15.290 --> 22:17.597
and it is not Murphy Mason.

22:17.640 --> 22:21.252
Here you go.

22:21.296 --> 22:24.081
One violation of the Americans
with Disabilities Act.

34:58.096 --> 35:00.098
Hello?

35:03.188 --> 35:04.798
Right now?

35:04.841 --> 35:06.582
Yes. Okay.

35:06.626 --> 35:08.149
I can be there.
[clears throat]

35:08.193 --> 35:09.455
Bye.

35:11.283 --> 35:12.719
Um...

35:12.762 --> 35:15.156
I'm really sorry. I...
I would love to stay, but I...

35:15.200 --> 35:17.593
Don't worry.
I'll, uh, I'll drink alone.

35:17.637 --> 35:19.639
Try hitting on some
chicks with your cane.

35:19.682 --> 35:21.467

35:25.123 --> 35:26.602
Listen, uh...
[clears throat]

35:26.646 --> 35:30.954
I know that Gene told
you about Jules today.

35:30.998 --> 35:33.957
Yeah. But I just figured
it was another thing

35:34.001 --> 35:36.351
you were keeping from me.

35:36.395 --> 35:38.875
Well, it is
actually thething

35:38.919 --> 35:40.834
that I've been
keeping from you.

35:40.877 --> 35:43.097
It's, um...

35:43.141 --> 35:46.753
honestly hard for
me to talk about...

35:46.796 --> 35:50.713
but... the weekend

35:50.757 --> 35:53.281
that Murphy and
I went away...

35:53.325 --> 35:55.501
Jules took her own life.

35:58.417 --> 36:00.767
We were supposed to be
working together...

36:00.810 --> 36:04.205
but I took a couple days
off to go out of town,

36:04.249 --> 36:07.600
and, uh... [exhales]

36:07.643 --> 36:12.474
when the chief called to tell me
what Jules had done,

36:12.518 --> 36:15.956
I... [scoffs]

36:15.999 --> 36:19.133
I blamed myself
for not being there.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.527
And Murphy wasn't

36:21.570 --> 36:24.617
exactly sympathetic,

36:24.660 --> 36:29.578
which led to a big fight
between us, and, um,

36:29.622 --> 36:33.843
that is the real reason
that we broke up.

36:34.844 --> 36:36.150
But...

36:36.194 --> 36:39.980
what Jules did,
it wasn't your fault.

36:40.023 --> 36:41.286
[sighs]

36:41.329 --> 36:43.940
I know that now.

36:43.984 --> 36:46.943
But in the moment...

36:46.987 --> 36:49.598
being so far away...

36:49.642 --> 36:52.645
uh... it was just easier
to blame myself.

36:55.213 --> 36:58.955
And that's why Murphy
called you a murderer.

37:00.392 --> 37:03.264
Yeah. [scoffs]

37:03.308 --> 37:04.874
She knew saying that
would hurt me

37:04.918 --> 37:07.181
on a very deep level.

37:10.271 --> 37:13.970
I am so sorry I
didn't tell you.

37:15.450 --> 37:17.452
I love you so
much, Chloe.

37:17.496 --> 37:19.498
I love you, too.

37:33.338 --> 37:35.949
[clicks tongue, exhales]

37:48.744 --> 37:50.093
How you doing?

37:50.137 --> 37:53.880
Um... I'm good. How--

37:53.923 --> 37:55.490
I'm good. How are you?

37:55.534 --> 37:58.537
Alive.
Thanks to your friend.

37:59.712 --> 38:01.931
Yeah. She's good
to have around.

38:03.846 --> 38:06.501
I heard you been
smuggling my product.

38:10.723 --> 38:12.377
I'm sorry. I-I...

38:12.420 --> 38:13.639
Look, I don't know how
you did it,

38:13.682 --> 38:16.598
but I want you to keep doing it.

38:16.642 --> 38:18.818
And you're
gonna start delivering

38:18.861 --> 38:20.602
to the women's
prison, too.

38:20.646 --> 38:23.605
You know, everybody thinks
it's stupid for me

38:23.649 --> 38:25.259
to keep my stash
at Guiding Hope,

38:25.303 --> 38:26.652
but what they don't realize,

38:26.695 --> 38:29.785
ain't that dog school
I see potential in, it's you.

38:29.829 --> 38:32.005
Me?Yeah.

38:32.048 --> 38:35.008
[grunts]
You act like you don't like it,

38:35.051 --> 38:37.010
but you're good at it.

38:37.053 --> 38:40.100
You don't ask permission,
you don't rely on anybody,

38:40.143 --> 38:42.015
you just do.

38:42.058 --> 38:43.843
And you do it for yourself.

38:43.886 --> 38:46.976
That's exactly how I got to
where I am right now.

38:47.020 --> 38:49.196
But if we're gonna keep
working together,

38:49.239 --> 38:52.330
you need to know
a few things.What?

38:53.722 --> 38:56.638
I can see how loyal you are
to the people you love.

38:56.682 --> 38:59.032
And I admire that.

38:59.075 --> 39:02.035
But I'm gonna need
some of that loyalty, too.

39:02.078 --> 39:04.907
Be careful who you trust.

39:04.951 --> 39:07.736
I learned that the hard way.

39:07.780 --> 39:09.956
People are just out
for themselves.

39:09.999 --> 39:11.784
And when their back's
against the wall,

39:11.827 --> 39:14.700
that's when you
got to watch out.

39:14.743 --> 39:16.528
Take it from me.
