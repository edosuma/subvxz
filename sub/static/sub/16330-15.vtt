Training helped you,

Well, it's gonna take time.

(Weller) Yeah, that's
something that we don't have.

00:41.647 --> 00:44.381
Well, my memories came back
when I was in the field.

What if we take Roman out again?

- It's a phone that my source

Hello.

Sorry, you don't need to...

After you told me about
it, I started thinking.

We need to be careful.

02:15.942 --> 02:18.784
Sandstorm feels like it's everywhere.

02:18.786 --> 02:21.358
Shepherd's been watching
me since I was a kid.

02:21.360 --> 02:23.213
They used you against me.

02:23.215 --> 02:25.470
You think Oliver is part of Sandstorm?

02:25.472 --> 02:29.420
We didn't realize Borden was
with them until it was too late.

02:29.422 --> 02:33.490
Inviting new people into our lives...

02:33.492 --> 02:35.793
that could give them the
opening they're looking for.

02:37.041 --> 02:38.834
- Morning.
- Morning.

02:38.836 --> 02:41.332
I just got a very unexpected
call from my source

02:41.334 --> 02:43.000
inside Sandstorm.

02:43.002 --> 02:44.263
He wants to meet.

02:44.265 --> 02:45.602
How can you be sure it's him?

02:45.604 --> 02:48.138
We had a challenge phrase. I'm sure.

02:48.140 --> 02:49.473
Where does he want to meet?

02:49.475 --> 02:51.642
I'm waiting for instructions.

02:53.103 --> 02:54.870
(Weller) Let us know
when you hear something.

02:58.784 --> 03:01.290
- Where's Reade?
- Delays on the "A" train.

03:01.292 --> 03:03.276
All right, so what do you got?

03:03.278 --> 03:07.016
All right, so, this is the
tattoo on Jane's left hip.

03:07.018 --> 03:09.287
Embedded within it is a continental coin.

03:09.289 --> 03:12.021
Anyone care to guess
the year it was minted?

03:12.023 --> 03:13.255
Obviously not.

03:13.257 --> 03:16.313
1776, the birth of our great nation.

03:16.315 --> 03:18.727
(Weller) Did Rich.com help you crack this?

03:18.729 --> 03:20.195
He might have loosened the jar.

03:20.197 --> 03:22.512
- Huh!
- Rich recognized the center symbol

03:22.514 --> 03:24.684
as a calling card for a notorious

03:24.686 --> 03:27.272
dark web courier called Lelantos.

03:27.274 --> 03:29.243
- What's he move?
- Anything you want.

03:29.245 --> 03:30.523
He's the FedEx of the underworld.

03:30.525 --> 03:32.574
The FBI never knew about this Lelantos?

03:32.576 --> 03:33.953
We've heard the name and known about

03:33.955 --> 03:35.852
a mysterious courier for a while, but...

03:35.854 --> 03:37.212
Now we know they're one and the same.

03:37.214 --> 03:38.317
(Jane) Do we have an ID on him?

03:38.319 --> 03:40.354
No! Look, the guy is a ghost,

03:40.356 --> 03:42.574
but it's rumored that he's
tatted up with this symbol.

03:42.576 --> 03:44.996
And he's moved some seriously scary stuff:

03:44.998 --> 03:47.644
chemical weapons, a
missing Turkish fighter jet.

03:47.646 --> 03:49.758
How do you move a fighter
jet without getting caught?

03:49.760 --> 03:51.028
Exactly.

03:51.030 --> 03:55.264
His last job was moving a boatload
of surface-to-air missiles into Syria.

03:55.266 --> 03:57.311
And the latest chatter is that Lelantos

03:57.313 --> 03:59.596
is about to move something
big into New York.

03:59.598 --> 04:00.551
So how do we find him?

04:00.553 --> 04:02.538
That's where another
tattoo comes into play.

04:02.540 --> 04:05.140
So, Jane has this tattoo of Aura

04:05.142 --> 04:07.061
on the back of her left ankle.

04:07.063 --> 04:10.480
In Greek mythology, Aura
is the daughter of Lelantos.

04:10.482 --> 04:14.083
So the numbers below Aura
correspond to the swords

04:14.085 --> 04:15.617
in the Lelantos tattoo.

04:15.619 --> 04:17.952
The swords point to letters.

04:17.954 --> 04:19.521
So, 29 is the 29th sword,

04:19.523 --> 04:21.557
which points to "M," 25 points to "A."

04:21.559 --> 04:23.759
Okay, then we cut to the
end and what does it say?

04:23.761 --> 04:25.858
"Marc Gelman."

04:25.860 --> 04:29.198
He's currently serving time
for involuntary manslaughter.

04:29.200 --> 04:30.510
But there's more.

04:30.512 --> 04:33.936
So, when I treated these
numbers as single digits,

04:33.938 --> 04:38.273
I was able to spell "Inner Care Medi-Spa."

04:38.275 --> 04:40.442
What's the name of the doctor
that runs it? He's famous.

04:40.444 --> 04:41.443
Dustin Katz.

04:41.445 --> 04:44.746
(Jane reading in Greek)

04:44.748 --> 04:46.682
Well, how does that play into this?

04:46.684 --> 04:48.650
Well, it's all Greek to me.

04:50.553 --> 04:51.725
Right, okay.

04:51.727 --> 04:53.722
So, as I was saying,

04:53.724 --> 04:55.390
that translates to,

04:55.392 --> 04:58.260
"Every division is a former union."

04:58.262 --> 05:00.960
I think that's a key, but I
haven't quite figured it out yet.

05:00.962 --> 05:02.931
So, what's the connection
between the prisoner,

05:02.933 --> 05:04.900
the spa, and the mystery puzzle?

05:04.902 --> 05:06.076
No idea.

05:06.078 --> 05:08.768
But these three tattoo
clues have to be the key

05:08.770 --> 05:10.272
to taking down Lelantos.

05:10.274 --> 05:11.838
The last time this guy surfaced,

05:11.840 --> 05:14.409
he gave Syria the ability
to shoot our planes down.

05:14.411 --> 05:16.244
Now he's moving something into New York.

05:19.616 --> 05:22.974
We need to split up.
Shut this thing down, now.

clue until we find this courier.

05:42.433 --> 05:44.033
Jane, Tasha, you're together.

05:44.035 --> 05:45.434
I want you to talk to Marc Gelman,

05:45.436 --> 05:46.398
see what you can find out.

05:46.400 --> 05:48.037
All right, his prison
transfer was approved.

05:48.039 --> 05:49.505
He's on his way here as we speak.

05:49.507 --> 05:51.720
I'll check out this medi-spa with Roman.

05:53.543 --> 05:54.977
You're taking Roman with you?

05:54.979 --> 05:56.433
This case has nothing to do with him.

05:56.435 --> 05:57.563
(Weller) Pellington called me,

05:57.565 --> 06:01.149
and if we don't start getting
actionable intel out of Roman soon,

06:01.151 --> 06:03.252
he's gonna hand him over to the CIA.

06:03.254 --> 06:06.055
All of Jane's memories
were triggered in the field.

06:06.057 --> 06:08.757
If we want the same for Roman,
we have to get him out there.

06:08.759 --> 06:10.372
This doesn't feel right.

06:10.374 --> 06:12.928
He's one of the architects
for Jane's tattoos.

06:12.930 --> 06:15.497
So letting him follow one
might trigger something big.

06:15.499 --> 06:17.266
Well, then maybe I should
be the one to go with him.

06:17.268 --> 06:18.153
No.

06:18.155 --> 06:21.195
The whole point is to put Roman
into new situations, all right?

Yeah, I'm fine. Just stupid drama.

07:16.093 --> 07:19.895
I just heard back from Patterson.
Marc Gelman is here in holding.

07:19.897 --> 07:20.996
What do we know about him?

07:20.998 --> 07:24.133
40, owns a shop specializing in
home decor in Greenwich Village.

07:24.135 --> 07:25.267
No priors.

07:25.269 --> 07:27.303
Circumstances around his arrest?

07:27.305 --> 07:30.606
He ran over a 90-year-old woman
crossing the street in the rain.

07:30.608 --> 07:31.827
Connections to Lelantos?

07:31.829 --> 07:34.510
Nada. At least not on paper.

07:34.512 --> 07:37.680
Wait, he hit that poor
woman three months ago.

07:37.682 --> 07:39.114
But the tattoo spelling out his name

07:39.116 --> 07:41.083
was put on your body way before that.

07:41.085 --> 07:43.402
So the car accident's
unrelated to Lelantos.

07:43.404 --> 07:44.753
We need to find out what Gelman was up to

07:44.755 --> 07:47.022
before the accident.

07:49.459 --> 07:51.627
I'm Agent Zapata. This
is my associate Jane.

07:51.629 --> 07:54.463
We have some questions as a
part of an ongoing investigation.

07:54.465 --> 07:56.265
(Jane) We're looking
into a courier service.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.552
I know the best one.

Place your order with me by noon,

08:00.525 --> 08:02.089
get it wrapped and ready
by the end of the day.

08:02.091 --> 08:05.374
Have you ever worked with a
courier by the name of Lelantos?

08:05.376 --> 08:06.525
Doesn't ring a bell.

08:06.527 --> 08:08.293
I mainly deal with Ethan or Ed.

08:09.749 --> 08:12.214
How about this symbol, hmm?

- Wish I could help you.

08:16.261 --> 08:17.786
If you know something,

08:17.788 --> 08:20.263
you'll make it a lot easier
on yourself by talking now.

08:20.265 --> 08:22.466
(Zapata) You know, all
your buddies back in prison

08:22.468 --> 08:23.592
know you were moved out.

08:23.594 --> 08:27.296
You wouldn't want them to know
that you were working with the Feds.

08:28.592 --> 08:30.291
Nobody likes a snitch.

08:30.293 --> 08:33.645
If I knew anything, I'd tell you.

08:40.376 --> 08:42.510
Did you see his face
when he saw the tattoo?

08:42.513 --> 08:45.470
Yeah. I hope he's a good designer
because he's a terrible poker player.

08:45.472 --> 08:47.282
- He knows something.
- Yeah.

08:47.284 --> 08:49.385
Look, I'm having my team
look into his finances,

08:49.387 --> 08:51.019
see if we find any red flags.

08:51.021 --> 08:53.021
All right. I'll look into known associates.

08:53.023 --> 08:55.090
Maybe he was connected
to this Lelantos courier

08:55.092 --> 08:56.125

08:56.127 --> 08:57.459
Yeah, cool.

Well, I took the "A"
train this morning, too,

09:05.169 --> 09:07.161
and it was running just fine.

09:07.163 --> 09:09.438

09:09.440 --> 09:10.417

09:10.419 --> 09:13.442
No, Reade's fine. He just slept in.

09:13.444 --> 09:16.200
I didn't want him to look
bad in front of Weller.

09:16.202 --> 09:19.515
You've never covered up
for somebody you care about?

09:19.517 --> 09:21.383
Look, if he's in some kind of trouble...

09:21.385 --> 09:23.585
He's fine.

Oh.

21:24.902 --> 21:26.802
A long time to see a doctor.

21:26.804 --> 21:29.504
Well, Patterson got us
to the front of the line.

21:29.506 --> 21:33.041
All right, I'm Chase Frank...

21:33.043 --> 21:36.730
a reclusive... trust fund baby.

21:36.732 --> 21:38.536
Won't the doctor know you're
not the real Chase Frank

21:38.538 --> 21:39.598
when he sees you?

21:39.600 --> 21:42.184
No, he hasn't met him before.

21:42.186 --> 21:45.004
What happens when the real guy shows up?

21:45.006 --> 21:47.522
He's being investigated for tax evasion.

21:47.524 --> 21:48.957
Patterson turned over some hidden assets

21:48.959 --> 21:51.290
with an old friend from the SEC.

21:51.292 --> 21:54.062
So, the IRS is having a field day

21:54.064 --> 21:56.565
in his Park Avenue penthouse.

21:56.567 --> 21:58.400
I'm guessing, from my suit, I'm your...

21:58.402 --> 21:59.801
Bodyguard.

21:59.803 --> 22:01.595
So just act like one.

22:01.597 --> 22:04.098
Keep your eyes peeled, stick close to me.

22:04.100 --> 22:05.974
And don't speak unless spoken to.

22:05.976 --> 22:08.977
Your name is Arnold Edwards.

22:10.747 --> 22:12.848
No weapon for me, I'm assuming.

22:14.880 --> 22:16.218
No.

22:16.220 --> 22:18.649
Just act like you have one.

22:18.651 --> 22:20.989
Our appointment's in an
hour. You almost ready?

22:20.991 --> 22:22.190
Yeah.

22:23.826 --> 22:26.657
Hey, thanks... for doing this.

22:26.659 --> 22:27.992
Bringing me out in the field.

22:29.101 --> 22:30.565
Every tattoo that we solve

22:30.567 --> 22:32.300
gets us a step closer to Shepherd.

22:32.302 --> 22:34.002
Once she's been put away for good,

22:34.004 --> 22:35.690
we can all move on with our lives.

22:35.692 --> 22:36.838
(locker clangs)

22:36.840 --> 22:39.975
Okay, Arnold Edwards,
you know your backstory?

22:39.977 --> 22:41.793
- I think so.
- All right.

22:41.795 --> 22:43.345
So, how long have you worked for me?

22:43.347 --> 22:44.913
Two years in April.

22:46.549 --> 22:48.884
Before you worked for me,
who else did you work for?

22:48.886 --> 22:52.062
Three years in Northlake
Security, Marines before that.

22:52.064 --> 22:53.155
What's your middle name?

22:53.157 --> 22:56.625
Trick question, I have two. Shawn Charles.

22:56.627 --> 22:58.560
- Very good. Memory's not that bad.
- (cell phone ringing)

22:58.562 --> 23:01.563
Here we are.

23:01.565 --> 23:03.970
Patterson just sent me
the plans to the medi-spa.

23:05.868 --> 23:07.936
(Roman) "Authorized personnel only."

23:07.938 --> 23:10.320
So... my guess is

23:10.322 --> 23:11.721
we gotta get in there.

23:13.976 --> 23:15.977
You're security, open the door.

23:15.979 --> 23:17.579
Thank you.

23:26.389 --> 23:27.556
Good morning.

23:39.268 --> 23:42.370
Welcome. You must be Chase.

23:42.372 --> 23:44.606
Yes. Hello.

23:44.608 --> 23:45.607
And you are?

23:45.609 --> 23:47.943
He's my personal security.

23:47.945 --> 23:50.645
Have a seat, please.

23:50.647 --> 23:52.948
(clears throat)

23:52.950 --> 23:55.050
So, you collect coins?

23:55.052 --> 23:57.252
It was a gift.

23:57.254 --> 23:59.428
Let me tell you a little
about what we do here.

23:59.430 --> 24:01.256
We're a holistic practice,

24:01.258 --> 24:02.591
meaning we believe good health

24:02.593 --> 24:05.560
comes from a strong body and mind.

24:05.562 --> 24:08.563
We offer full body scans,
psychological work-ups

24:08.565 --> 24:11.066
and personalized meal plans.

24:11.068 --> 24:12.467
That sounds very good.

24:12.469 --> 24:13.493
Well, a lot of patients rebel

24:13.495 --> 24:15.103
when I tell them they
have to give up poisons

24:15.105 --> 24:17.162
like beer and sweets,

24:17.164 --> 24:21.409
but they always thank me in the end.

24:21.411 --> 24:23.845
I can't help but notice your scar.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.016
May I ask how you got it?

24:28.018 --> 24:30.126
I don't know.

24:30.128 --> 24:35.590
Physical scars often indicate
deep emotional ones as well.

24:35.592 --> 24:37.931
If you'd like, one of our
trained psychologists could...

24:37.933 --> 24:39.479
What does this have to do with anything?

24:39.481 --> 24:41.316
Please. I don't mean to upset you.

24:41.318 --> 24:43.771
You see this and you think
you know everything about me?

24:43.773 --> 24:45.300
No, no, let him go.

24:45.302 --> 24:47.428
Let him go, Arnold. Let him go.

24:47.430 --> 24:49.838
- Oh, God.
- S-Sorry.

24:49.840 --> 24:51.988
I-I don't know what came over him.

24:51.990 --> 24:55.143
Well, why don't you show
them to the meditation space?

24:55.145 --> 24:58.513
Okay. Doctor. Heh.

24:59.515 --> 25:01.383
(clears throat)

25:01.385 --> 25:03.318
Thank you.

25:05.755 --> 25:07.255
Sir, come with me?

25:07.257 --> 25:09.224
Yes, thank you.

25:09.226 --> 25:10.425
(woman) This way.

25:14.230 --> 25:15.662
What the hell is wrong with you?

25:15.664 --> 25:17.594
You could have just
compromised this whole mission.

25:22.872 --> 25:26.508
The secure door. Now we can get in.

25:26.510 --> 25:29.010
That was out of line.

25:29.012 --> 25:30.178
But nice work.

25:30.180 --> 25:31.880
(cell phone rings)

25:33.883 --> 25:36.751
APB... from Jane and Tasha.

25:37.987 --> 25:39.921
You recognize her?

25:39.923 --> 25:42.724
No, but at least their part of the tattoo

25:42.726 --> 25:44.226
is leading somewhere.

25:44.228 --> 25:45.493
(grunts)

25:45.495 --> 25:47.696
All right, let's go.

25:50.399 --> 25:51.867
(keypad beeps, door clicks)

25:54.470 --> 25:55.470
(handle clicking)

25:59.208 --> 26:00.208
All right.

26:00.210 --> 26:02.577
Roman, keep an eye out.

26:04.280 --> 26:06.514
(click, computer trilling)

26:06.516 --> 26:08.249
_

26:08.251 --> 26:12.220
(cell phone vibrating)

26:12.222 --> 26:13.288
It's Weller.

26:13.290 --> 26:14.623
It's Reade and Patterson.

26:14.625 --> 26:16.224
Tasha and Jane, too.

26:16.226 --> 26:17.418
You got me, too.

26:17.420 --> 26:19.469
Hey, Marjory Ellis, the woman from our APB,

26:19.471 --> 26:23.265
has been laundering millions
out of an auction house.

26:23.267 --> 26:25.077
- Any idea what for?
- (Zapata) <i>Not yet.</i>

26:25.079 --> 26:26.316
<i>But she has heavy protection.</i>

26:26.318 --> 26:27.535
Just tried to have us killed.

26:27.537 --> 26:30.438
If these tattoos are connected,
it could be cartel-related.

26:30.440 --> 26:35.143
That address led us to a guy
with ties to the Estebez family.

26:35.145 --> 26:36.774
Yeah, well, it might be drug money.

26:36.776 --> 26:38.370
(Reade) Possibly, but now
we're standing in a warehouse

26:38.372 --> 26:39.915
our dead suspect was paying for

26:39.917 --> 26:42.298
and the cots all have chains on the beds.

26:42.300 --> 26:44.319
(Patterson) <i>And all
these people are missing.</i>

26:45.888 --> 26:47.489
Any idea who they are?

26:47.491 --> 26:49.499
(Patterson) <i>Our suspect sponsored</i>

26:49.501 --> 26:52.115
<i>dozens of work visas
for Mexican nationals.</i>

26:52.117 --> 26:53.373
- (computer beeps)
- Looks like it might've been

26:53.375 --> 26:55.768
an elaborate scheme to traffic people.

26:56.766 --> 26:57.899
Done.

27:01.470 --> 27:04.906
This doctor's got a cabinet full
of cyclosporine and tacrolimus.

27:04.908 --> 27:07.242
Wait, those are anti-rejection meds.

27:07.244 --> 27:09.010
For organ transplants.

27:09.012 --> 27:10.771
So this isn't just a medi-spa.

27:10.773 --> 27:11.845
_

27:11.847 --> 27:13.648
They're doing the transplants here.

27:13.650 --> 27:15.951
Missing people are being
sold for their organs.

27:15.953 --> 27:18.186
So that's how Dr. Katz
performed his miracles.

27:18.188 --> 27:20.989
Makes sense why someone would
hire Lelantos to move them.

27:23.821 --> 27:24.821
(Roman) Weller.

27:27.663 --> 27:29.331
It's the woman from the APB.

27:29.333 --> 27:30.665
Marjory Ellis is there?

27:30.667 --> 27:32.000
Call you back.

27:32.002 --> 27:33.335
(phone beeps off)

27:33.337 --> 27:34.336
Come on.

27:37.840 --> 27:39.287
We have to pack up! It's over.

27:39.289 --> 27:41.009
They won't be able to pin anything on us.

27:41.011 --> 27:43.144
The best thing to do is
cooperate with the authorities.

27:43.146 --> 27:45.447
Are you insane?! You...

27:45.449 --> 27:47.136
You're gonna put all of
this on me, aren't you?

27:47.138 --> 27:48.049
Calm down.

27:48.051 --> 27:49.784
I'm not going to let you sell me out!

27:49.786 --> 27:52.119
- Marjory!
- Get your hands off of me!

27:55.825 --> 27:57.025
(gunshots, Katz shouts)

28:06.235 --> 28:08.870
He's gone. We gotta find Marjory.

28:12.575 --> 28:13.708
FBI.

28:13.710 --> 28:15.710
- Drop your weapon...
- (both groan)

28:15.712 --> 28:17.312
(Tasers clacking)

28:25.014 --> 28:26.582
(Reade) All right, just got off with NYPD.

28:26.584 --> 28:28.650
No sign of Weller or
Roman at the medi-spa,

28:28.652 --> 28:30.485
but the undercover car's
still parked at the lot.

28:30.487 --> 28:32.320
They never would have
turned their phones off.

28:32.322 --> 28:34.889
All right, these are the files
Weller uploaded to the cloud.

28:34.891 --> 28:37.826
Dozens of Dr. Katz's
patients are on the wait-list

28:37.828 --> 28:39.394
for the national donor registration.

28:39.396 --> 28:41.496
Katz was bypassing the wait-list

28:41.498 --> 28:44.766
and performing black market
transplants for his rich patients.

28:44.768 --> 28:46.067
Wait.

28:46.069 --> 28:49.454
Dr. Katz made a wire transfer
in the amount of $320,000

28:49.456 --> 28:51.490
to one of Marjory's hidden
accounts this morning.

28:52.914 --> 28:54.909
He was paying for a
fresh shipment of people.

28:54.911 --> 28:56.411
The missing people from the warehouse.

28:56.413 --> 28:57.879
Well, that lines up with chatter about

28:57.881 --> 29:00.081
Lelantos moving goods in New York.

29:00.083 --> 29:02.304
Marjory is tying up loose ends,

29:02.306 --> 29:04.286
so she might be trying to get rid of them.

29:04.288 --> 29:06.857
If we track them, then we may
have a chance at catching her

29:06.859 --> 29:08.523
and saving the innocent people.

29:08.525 --> 29:10.250
And getting Weller and Roman back.

29:10.252 --> 29:12.585
(cell phone vibrates)

29:12.587 --> 29:14.120
Okay, this is from my source.

29:14.122 --> 29:15.737
He's given me coordinates on a dead drop.

29:15.739 --> 29:17.657
- It's way out of town.
- We got this.

29:19.060 --> 29:20.794
I'll be back as soon as I can, okay?

29:20.796 --> 29:22.429
Keep me in the loop.

29:26.876 --> 29:29.544
There were three clues from my tattoo,

29:29.546 --> 29:32.013
and one pointed directly at Marc Gelman.

29:32.015 --> 29:34.716
He's gotta know more than he's letting on.

29:34.718 --> 29:37.519
He could help us find Weller and Roman.

29:37.521 --> 29:38.924
Organ trafficking ring?

29:38.926 --> 29:41.269
We have a money trail
a mile long to prove it.

29:41.271 --> 29:43.825
I don't know what to tell you.

29:43.827 --> 29:45.149
Found this on Marjory's hard drive.

29:45.151 --> 29:46.511
We're in a relationship.
What does that prove?

29:46.513 --> 29:48.213
That you had your girlfriend
running your operation

29:48.215 --> 29:49.297
while you were behind bars.

29:49.299 --> 29:52.033
Marjory killed one of
your clients, Dr. Katz.

29:52.035 --> 29:53.902
What?

29:53.904 --> 29:55.152
What are these?

29:55.154 --> 29:57.150
Offshore accounts in Marjory's name only.

29:57.152 --> 29:58.042
(Reade) You had her open these accounts

29:58.044 --> 29:59.320
so you wouldn't raise any red flags.

29:59.322 --> 30:02.710
No, no. No, I didn't. No. I swear.

30:02.712 --> 30:06.047
Okay, I believe you.

30:06.049 --> 30:08.129
You didn't know Marjory was
keeping the business running

30:08.131 --> 30:11.553
and holding the profits for herself.

30:11.555 --> 30:15.824
I trusted her. I loved her.

30:15.826 --> 30:18.927
But she never had your back.
She was in it for the money.

30:18.929 --> 30:23.164
Are you really willing to
risk a life in prison for her?

30:23.166 --> 30:25.934
(sighs)

30:25.936 --> 30:27.702
How could she do this?

30:27.704 --> 30:30.205
You have a lot of blood on your hands.

30:30.207 --> 30:32.814
But now's your chance to save lives.

30:34.243 --> 30:35.985
Where would she have taken the people?

30:35.987 --> 30:37.100
I don't know.

30:37.102 --> 30:38.746
Unless she arranged another sale.

30:38.748 --> 30:40.515
To who?

30:40.517 --> 30:42.584
Think, Marc. Who would she call?

30:42.586 --> 30:45.186
There were these buyers, Ukrainians.

30:45.188 --> 30:47.689
They were the only ones that
Marjory dealt with directly.

30:47.691 --> 30:49.958
She knows the language.

30:49.960 --> 30:51.459
Okay, where do the deals go down?

30:51.461 --> 30:54.471
Route 23, the truck depot past exit 15.

30:54.473 --> 30:56.064
Anything else you want to tell us?

30:56.066 --> 30:58.600
Lelantos...

30:58.602 --> 31:01.703
he'll be driving the truck.

31:01.705 --> 31:04.072
Don't underestimate him.

31:06.050 --> 31:08.218
(engine revving, truck squeaking)

31:08.220 --> 31:09.619
(Roman coughs)

31:11.388 --> 31:13.523
(coughing)

31:18.529 --> 31:21.197
They threw me in that room!
They threw me in there!

31:21.199 --> 31:22.198
Roman, calm down.

31:22.200 --> 31:23.765
I saw the orphanage.

31:23.767 --> 31:25.602
Roman, look at me. Look at me!

31:25.604 --> 31:27.470
All right, just calm down.

31:27.472 --> 31:30.273
You're not there. You're
not in the orphanage.

31:30.275 --> 31:34.711
You want to see your sister
again, just listen to me. Okay?

31:34.713 --> 31:36.813
You're not helpless anymore. All right?

31:36.815 --> 31:38.481
We can get out of here.

31:38.483 --> 31:40.683
We can save all these people.

31:40.685 --> 31:42.819
But I need your help, okay?

31:42.821 --> 31:44.754
We have to do it together.

31:46.357 --> 31:47.664
Okay.

Hey, how are you feeling?

I'm fine. How's Roman doing?

35:27.280 --> 35:29.561
Oh, he'll be okay, thanks to you.

35:29.563 --> 35:34.015
Heh. You know, he wasn't
half-bad company today.

35:34.017 --> 35:35.267
Oh, yeah?

35:35.269 --> 35:37.269
I think I kind of like him.

35:37.271 --> 35:40.071
Well, just play it cool. You
don't want to come on too strong.

35:40.073 --> 35:42.641
(laughing) Hey, uh...

35:44.110 --> 35:46.178
You know what I said to you this morning

35:46.180 --> 35:48.660
- about that guy that you're seeing?
- Kurt, you don't have to...

35:48.662 --> 35:50.148
No, I do.

35:50.150 --> 35:54.256
Look, you need to be cautious, we all do.

35:54.258 --> 35:57.522
But that doesn't mean you
have to assume the worst.

35:57.524 --> 35:59.824
So you think I should give him a chance?

35:59.826 --> 36:03.361
Well, that's... that's up to you.

36:03.363 --> 36:06.464
You always look for the best in people.

36:06.466 --> 36:09.726
I wouldn't want you to change that.

36:09.728 --> 36:11.328
It's one of my favorite things about you.

36:12.338 --> 36:14.639
Thank you.

36:26.752 --> 36:29.487
Close call out there.

36:29.489 --> 36:32.591
Yeah, I'm just finishing
up my work on Marc Gelman.

36:32.593 --> 36:34.092
Hope he enjoys supermax.

36:34.094 --> 36:35.994
Yeah.

36:38.130 --> 36:39.726
Well, he probably never imagined

36:39.728 --> 36:42.500
that his girlfriend would
be the reason he'd go down.

36:42.502 --> 36:44.269
(laughing) Nope.

36:45.771 --> 36:46.923
I think you were right.

36:46.925 --> 36:49.941
Could you do a background check on Oliver?

36:49.943 --> 36:51.752
You sure?

36:51.754 --> 36:53.845
Yeah. I mean...

36:53.847 --> 36:55.883
hopefully, there's nothing,

36:55.885 --> 36:57.732
but at least I'll know.

36:57.734 --> 36:59.386
Okay, what's his name?

36:59.388 --> 37:01.136
- Oliver Kind.
- Birthday.

37:01.138 --> 37:03.639
November 6, 1979.

37:03.641 --> 37:05.940
(computer beeping)

37:05.942 --> 37:07.709
Huh. Okay.

37:07.711 --> 37:09.580
I have a court document that says

37:09.582 --> 37:11.906
that he changed his name 12 years ago.

37:11.908 --> 37:13.040
Why would he do that?

37:13.042 --> 37:15.570
Lots of people change their
names. Don't jump to conclusions.

37:15.572 --> 37:17.178
Would you jump to conclusions?

37:17.180 --> 37:19.280
Yeah, but that's why I'm single.

37:21.277 --> 37:22.344
Right.

37:25.247 --> 37:26.247
(door clatters)

37:28.622 --> 37:29.796
How's your wrist?

37:29.798 --> 37:31.199
Hurts like hell.

37:31.201 --> 37:32.975
Try this.

37:32.977 --> 37:36.037
Dr. Katz is full of
crap. Beer's good for you.

37:36.039 --> 37:37.466
(cracks tab)

37:37.468 --> 37:39.107
- You did good today.
- (Roman cracking tab)

37:39.109 --> 37:40.408
Nice work.

37:47.716 --> 37:50.819
I didn't remember anything new.

37:50.821 --> 37:53.888
Just the same old
nightmares from my childhood.

37:53.890 --> 37:55.790
Sorry to hear that, Roman.

37:55.792 --> 37:57.584
And I speak a little Spanish.

37:57.586 --> 38:00.820
(chuckling)

38:00.822 --> 38:04.415
I know you're all counting on me...

38:04.417 --> 38:07.642
but part of me hopes I
never remember anything else.

38:10.164 --> 38:13.099
I don't want to know what
else I had to live through.

38:13.101 --> 38:15.635
What else Shepherd made me do.

38:17.471 --> 38:20.006
There are a few things from my childhood...

38:20.008 --> 38:21.674
I wish I could just forget.

38:21.676 --> 38:23.437
I know what it's like...

38:23.439 --> 38:24.978
to have a parent that wasn't there

38:24.980 --> 38:27.313
when you needed them to be.

38:30.184 --> 38:34.187
The feeling that you always
have to fend for yourself.

38:36.090 --> 38:39.058
No kid should ever have
to grow up like that.

38:44.565 --> 38:45.632
(locker shuts)

38:48.869 --> 38:50.870
Hey.

38:50.872 --> 38:53.273
Hey, you going to this
drink thing at Weller's?

38:53.275 --> 38:54.607
Yeah.

38:54.609 --> 38:56.209
Need a ride?

38:56.211 --> 38:58.678
No.

38:58.680 --> 38:59.712
(bag zips shut)

39:01.782 --> 39:04.384
You were a split second away
from getting killed today.

39:04.386 --> 39:06.777
Yeah, I know, I can't
thank you enough, man.

39:06.779 --> 39:07.921
Let me finish.

39:07.923 --> 39:10.056
It would have been your own fault.

39:10.058 --> 39:11.925
(chuckles) What?

39:14.428 --> 39:16.596
I know you're using.

39:16.598 --> 39:18.431
What?

39:18.433 --> 39:20.467
I don't know how bad it is, but I know.

39:20.469 --> 39:22.869
Before you say anything else stupid,

39:22.871 --> 39:24.270
maybe you should go home.

39:24.272 --> 39:26.811
This morning, your pupils were dilated.

39:26.813 --> 39:28.074
You were anxious and irritable.

39:28.076 --> 39:29.476
You've been showing up late for work

39:29.478 --> 39:32.212
and lying about it, and today...

39:32.214 --> 39:35.815
you nearly got killed
because you were unfocused.

39:35.817 --> 39:38.232
How the hell do you think
you know anything about me

39:38.234 --> 39:39.667
or what I'm going through?

39:41.255 --> 39:43.590
I have a brother.

39:43.592 --> 39:45.592
I don't really talk about him.

39:47.394 --> 39:49.086
But he almost died
because of his addiction,

39:49.088 --> 39:50.363
and he's still not well.

39:50.365 --> 39:52.969
And whenever the phone rings
in the middle of the night,

39:52.971 --> 39:54.767
I think it's finally the call.

39:54.769 --> 39:58.471
I'm sorry about your brother...

39:58.473 --> 40:01.098
but I was off today because I was tired.

40:01.100 --> 40:03.576
That's it. So maybe we need to stop

40:03.578 --> 40:05.800
and just pretend that we
never had this conversation.

40:05.802 --> 40:07.163
You need help.

40:07.165 --> 40:09.673
And you need to stop projecting
and deal with your own issues

40:09.675 --> 40:11.575
because you don't know what
the hell you're talking about.

40:19.760 --> 40:21.661
(knocking on door)

40:23.284 --> 40:24.317
(clears throat)

40:25.332 --> 40:26.466
Hey.

40:26.468 --> 40:27.667
Sorry I'm late. I had to stop

40:27.669 --> 40:29.168
at two places to get everything.

40:29.170 --> 40:31.004
Oh, that's all right.

40:31.006 --> 40:32.672
- Mm.
- Hmm...

40:34.275 --> 40:36.075
(giggles)

40:36.077 --> 40:37.443
(laughing)

40:37.445 --> 40:38.811
What's for dinner?

40:38.813 --> 40:41.060
We are having pan-seared barramundi

40:41.062 --> 40:42.348
flown in from Queensland.

40:42.350 --> 40:45.229
You do know I'm a horrible cook, right?

40:45.231 --> 40:47.420
- All you need to do is eat.
- Mmm.

40:47.422 --> 40:50.423
Well, I think I can manage that.

40:50.425 --> 40:52.255
(clears throat)

40:52.257 --> 40:54.027
I was thinking, uh, there's something

40:54.029 --> 40:55.828
I've been wanting to ask you.

40:55.830 --> 40:57.497
- Will you open that?
- Um...

41:01.802 --> 41:04.381
Did you... change your name?

41:10.010 --> 41:12.522
You looked into me. I don't understand.

41:12.524 --> 41:15.832
You were the one who said you
didn't want to talk about the past.

41:15.834 --> 41:18.983
I don't push you on your mysterious tattoos

41:18.985 --> 41:20.453
or where you go all day.

41:20.455 --> 41:23.681
Why you live in this apartment with
practically no personal belongings.

41:23.683 --> 41:24.891
I know, I'm...

41:24.893 --> 41:28.346
So it's not okay for me to ask a
question, but you can go digging.

41:28.348 --> 41:29.864
There are circumstances.

41:29.866 --> 41:32.098
And what exactly are those circumstances?

41:35.636 --> 41:39.238
Right. You don't want to talk about it.

41:39.240 --> 41:41.407
I'm gonna go.

41:45.179 --> 41:47.680
