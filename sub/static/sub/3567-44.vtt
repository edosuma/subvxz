<i> ~ Fora Temer ~</i>

00:03.527 --> 00:05.678
<i>Can I look yet?</i>

00:05.762 --> 00:07.763
Okay.

00:07.848 --> 00:10.850
Books!
Whoa! Cool cover.

00:10.934 --> 00:14.603
It's my favorite series.
It's about this girl named Lisa,

00:14.688 --> 00:17.406
and she's a witch.
I mean, she doesn't know she's

00:17.441 --> 00:19.942
a witch at first.
And she has a familiar, which is

00:19.993 --> 00:23.862
sort of like this spirit companion
that everyone in the world has,

00:23.897 --> 00:26.782
and hers is a talking
falcon named Archimicarus.

00:26.833 --> 00:30.453
Anyways, she goes on this quest
to find her father after

00:30.537 --> 00:32.838
he's kidnapped by a
mysterious one-eyed man.

00:32.923 --> 00:37.793
- Whoa! Mystery!
- Here, let me get you started.

00:39.107 --> 00:41.630
"Chapter one: The morning thief.

00:41.681 --> 00:45.468
Lisa awoke with a start,
the echoes of her dreams still

00:45.602 --> 00:48.304
<i>dancing in her mind.
The low rumble of thunder</i>

00:48.355 --> 00:49.855
<i>murmured through the quiet house."</i>

00:51.625 --> 00:53.275
Whoa!

00:53.310 --> 00:57.646
- This is a really good book.
- Uh... okay.

00:57.697 --> 01:01.650
"The house was deathly still.
The only sound Lisa could hear

01:01.701 --> 01:04.569
was her own heartbeat
pounding in her ears.

01:04.654 --> 01:07.490
The hairs on her neck tingled
when suddenly..."

01:07.541 --> 01:09.625
What the...

01:09.659 --> 01:11.452
What was that?

01:16.766 --> 01:19.552
- It's one of the marble robots!
- What?

01:20.837 --> 01:22.671
Huh?!

01:22.756 --> 01:26.592
<i>- Amethyst! Pearl!
- Hyah!</i>

01:30.597 --> 01:32.848
- You okay?
- I love hanging out at your place.

01:32.899 --> 01:37.485
- Pearl, do you think this was ...
- One of Peridot's machines?

01:37.520 --> 01:41.774
Yes, I think so, only ...
we've never seen one this big before.

01:41.858 --> 01:46.411
- Or this gooey.
- Amethyst, we need to be careful.

01:46.446 --> 01:49.281
We don't know what this stuff is.

01:49.366 --> 01:51.917
Oh, no. Don't you
dare get that stuff on me!

01:52.002 --> 01:53.586
Goop hug!

01:53.670 --> 01:55.788
Come here, Pearl!
I love you, Pearl!

01:55.872 --> 01:58.207
Peridot. Is that the
gem you told me about ...

01:58.341 --> 02:00.459
the one that's trying
to come to Earth?

02:00.544 --> 02:02.962
Yeah, we stopped her
before, but I guess she can

02:03.046 --> 02:05.548
still shoot stuff here from space.

02:07.657 --> 02:09.858
So, what do you think it was here to do?

02:09.943 --> 02:12.661
We destroyed it.
That's all that matters.

02:12.696 --> 02:14.530
Hmm.

02:14.581 --> 02:16.365
Goop hug!

02:20.203 --> 02:22.137
Connie!
The Steven Universe boy

02:22.205 --> 02:24.506
would like to speak with you.

02:24.574 --> 02:26.608
I swear that's not his real name.

02:26.710 --> 02:29.111
Hi, Steven. What's up?
Have you read more

02:29.179 --> 02:31.680
- "Unfamiliar familiar"?
- Yeah, but I'm ...

02:31.748 --> 02:33.682
Isn't it amazing?

02:33.750 --> 02:35.985
- How far did you get?
- I'm in the middle

02:36.052 --> 02:37.853
of one of them, but I'm really confused.

02:37.921 --> 02:41.123
They keep talking about this
plinkman guy who died.

02:41.191 --> 02:44.426
- Am I supposed to know who he is?
- Plinkman?

02:44.494 --> 02:47.863
But that's Lisa's dad.
Steven, you're reading them

02:47.931 --> 02:50.632
- in order, right?
- There's an order?!

02:50.700 --> 02:54.036
Aw, man. I just started with
the one with the coolest cover.

02:55.171 --> 02:56.171
<i>Hello?</i>

02:56.720 --> 02:58.657
Connie?

02:58.658 --> 03:00.075
What the...

03:00.160 --> 03:02.461
Something
entered the atmosphere.

03:02.545 --> 03:04.480
Up there!

03:04.547 --> 03:06.548
It's another one of those things!

03:06.633 --> 03:08.417
It landed on mask island.

03:08.468 --> 03:11.562
- Come on!
- Connie, I'm gonna call you back!

03:14.841 --> 03:16.809
Is it looking for a warp?

03:16.893 --> 03:18.844
We have to stop it!

03:23.900 --> 03:27.063
Yeesh.
What are these things trying to do?

03:27.098 --> 03:29.638
We're not really that sure.

03:29.639 --> 03:34.476
- It's not trying to do anything now.
- Mm.

03:34.544 --> 03:37.846
Okay, so, you read the first
three books in order.

03:37.914 --> 03:41.450
- Do you... like them?
- Of course!

03:41.501 --> 03:43.819
They're awesome!
I really love Lisa's familiar.

03:43.887 --> 03:46.622
He's my favorite.
I'm just confused about

03:46.723 --> 03:49.058
- one thing, though.
- Mm, what's that?

03:49.125 --> 03:54.630
- What is a familiar?
- Nooo.

03:56.850 --> 03:59.935
Was that another one
of those marble things?

04:01.413 --> 04:05.941
- Yeah.
- Grrr! What is with these things?!

04:06.042 --> 04:09.511
- This is like the fifth one this week.
- We'll find it in the desert.

04:09.579 --> 04:13.315
Connie, talk later.
Wait, you guys! Wait for me!

04:20.572 --> 04:24.660
Stop coming here, you stupid balls!

04:24.711 --> 04:26.829
Yeah, let it out! Get crazy!

04:26.913 --> 04:28.797
- Wah!
- Guys, guys, guys!

04:28.832 --> 04:32.000
Stop!
How many more of these things

04:32.135 --> 04:35.087
- are you gonna have to fight?
- We don't know!

04:35.171 --> 04:38.507
They just keep coming and
coming, and we don't even know

04:38.591 --> 04:41.844
what they are!
We don't know anything!

04:41.895 --> 04:45.481
Th-That's okay.
I-I don't know anything all the time.

04:45.515 --> 04:49.276
It's like my whole life.
But I've got you guys to tell me

04:49.277 --> 04:51.900
about gem stuff, Connie can explain what

04:51.901 --> 04:55.131
familiars are, and Dad
tells me weird Dad stuff.

04:55.166 --> 04:57.860
But nobody knows what
these things are here to do.

04:57.911 --> 05:01.497
Well... it probably does.

05:01.531 --> 05:03.532
- What?
- We could follow it

05:03.583 --> 05:05.834
- and see where it goes.
- Are you nuts?!

05:06.029 --> 05:08.030
Who knows what could go wrong?!

05:08.081 --> 05:10.532
We can't fight
these things forever.

05:10.617 --> 05:12.200
Well, we can, but I don't want to.

05:12.285 --> 05:14.786
- Let's do it Steven's way.
- Yeah!

05:14.871 --> 05:18.924
# let's follow the funky flo-o-o-w#

05:19.008 --> 05:22.825
We're dead.

05:24.130 --> 05:26.848
All right, big guy.

05:26.933 --> 05:28.967
- Mush.
- Oh, oh, oh!

05:31.688 --> 05:32.771
Whoo-hoo!

05:36.142 --> 05:38.727
Kindergarten.

05:38.811 --> 05:41.730
Oh, why here?
This site has been damaged

05:41.814 --> 05:45.351
<i>enough by the gems that were
incubated here 6,000 years ago.</i>

05:45.386 --> 05:47.619
That's it! It's confirmed!

05:47.737 --> 05:49.905
- This thing is up to no good.
- Wait!

05:49.989 --> 05:51.990
We don't even know what it's
doing here.

05:52.075 --> 05:54.993
Can't we just see where it wants to go?

05:55.078 --> 05:57.579
- Garnet.
- Mm...

05:57.664 --> 05:59.665
- Steven's way.
- Ugh.

06:04.754 --> 06:06.638
<i>What does it want here?</i>

06:06.723 --> 06:09.591
Maybe it just wants
to see where Amethyst was made.

06:09.676 --> 06:11.760
Maybe it should
mind its own business.

06:11.844 --> 06:13.261
I don't like this at all.

06:13.346 --> 06:15.514
- But ...
- I'm kind of with

06:15.598 --> 06:17.816
- Pearl on this one.
- Aw, come on.

06:17.900 --> 06:19.901
Can't you feel this guy's funky flow?

06:19.986 --> 06:24.063
- He's a funk master.
- I can't believe we're doing this.

06:24.624 --> 06:26.383
Why'd you stop, little buddy?

06:26.634 --> 06:29.361
- Something's happening.
- Whoa!

06:38.921 --> 06:41.373
Yes!

06:44.210 --> 06:47.796
See? I knew we'd find
something cool! Let's go.

06:52.909 --> 06:55.770
Hey, guys. Goin' down?

06:55.855 --> 06:58.723
- Are you okay?
- What is all this?

07:11.570 --> 07:14.039
What's that sound?

07:36.812 --> 07:39.147
<i>Establish gem-projection
link with control room.</i>

07:39.231 --> 07:41.933
<i>Plug robonoid has successfully
landed on planet Earth and</i>

07:42.018 --> 07:44.436
<i>entered prime kindergarten
control room in Facet 5.</i>

07:44.487 --> 07:48.073
<i>We'll proceed to perform
status-check of kindergarten.</i>

07:48.107 --> 07:50.108
It's Peridot.

07:50.192 --> 07:52.193
Is she trying to
re-activate the kindergarten?

07:52.278 --> 07:54.362
Doesn't she know it'll destroy
all life on Earth?

07:54.447 --> 07:56.748
- Why don't we ask her?
- Shh!

07:56.849 --> 08:00.247
Steven, we're facing an enemy
we don't know,

08:00.291 --> 08:03.788
a technology we don't understand.
This isn't the time to be

08:03.856 --> 08:05.990
- asking questions.
- Really sounds like it is.

08:06.058 --> 08:08.660
Okay, here's the plan ...

08:08.695 --> 08:10.929
we can't let her see us,
so we wait for an opening.

08:10.996 --> 08:13.423
When she's distracted,
we destroy the power

08:13.424 --> 08:15.850
source on the far wall.
Steven stays here.

08:15.935 --> 08:17.802
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

08:21.357 --> 08:22.737
<i>Steven!</i>

08:22.738 --> 08:26.378
<i>Now accounting for all
operational injectors.</i>

08:26.379 --> 08:31.533
<i>Checking for aberrations
in perimeter.</i>

08:31.617 --> 08:34.807
<i>This gem tech is simply archaic.</i>

08:34.842 --> 08:40.207
Uh, I don't know.
I think it looks pretty cool.

08:40.292 --> 08:42.043
Hi. I'm Steven.

08:43.879 --> 08:48.483
<i>There appears to be an infestation
of..."Stevens" in the kindergarten.</i>

08:48.484 --> 08:51.695
Aw, I'm not so bad
once you get to know me.

08:51.696 --> 08:55.814
<i>And how many more Stevens
are present in this area?</i>

08:55.849 --> 08:58.309
Oh.
Just me.

08:58.344 --> 09:02.313
<i>Ah, that's a relief.
So, tell me, have Stevens</i>

09:02.348 --> 09:05.934
<i>replaced humans as the
dominant species on Earth?</i>

09:06.018 --> 09:08.153
Oh, no, there's lots of humans.

09:08.187 --> 09:12.740
There's my Dad, Connie, Lars,
and Sadie, the mailman, Onion ...

09:12.858 --> 09:14.859
I think.
Lots of people!

09:14.944 --> 09:17.295
- Hmm.
- Now I get to ask a question.

09:17.363 --> 09:20.498
What are you doing?

09:20.566 --> 09:24.035
<i>Mm.
Just picking up where we left off.</i>

09:31.093 --> 09:33.845
<i>A gem?!</i>

09:33.879 --> 09:36.047
<i>More?
But the red eye didn't report</i>

09:36.132 --> 09:38.216
<i>the presence of any gems on this planet.</i>

09:38.267 --> 09:40.268
That's because we destroyed it.

09:40.386 --> 09:42.887
<i>You what?
But the records say that gems</i>

09:42.972 --> 09:45.190
<i>were wiped out on Earth.
Wait a minute.</i>

09:45.224 --> 09:48.393
<i>You're the ones that have been
destroying my plug robonoids!</i>

09:48.477 --> 09:51.896
<i>Are you the reason the
homeworld warp is down again?</i>

09:51.947 --> 09:54.199
<i>Is this your bizarre icon?!
Ohh!</i>

09:54.233 --> 09:56.985
<i>Why do you keep destroying my things?!</i>

09:57.069 --> 10:00.505
Because we are the Crystal Gems!

10:00.573 --> 10:04.259
We're still alive, and
we're still the guardians

10:04.260 --> 10:07.946
of this planet and all
its living creatures!

10:08.013 --> 10:11.249
<i>The Crystal Gems?</i>

10:11.383 --> 10:14.552
<i>Stop! How dare you?!</i>

10:14.637 --> 10:16.304
<i>I'm doing this one way or another.</i>

10:16.388 --> 10:20.354
<i>You're just
making it really difficult!</i>

10:20.389 --> 10:22.260
Amethyst, now!

10:22.344 --> 10:26.147
- Destroy!
- I'm reporting this!

10:27.834 --> 10:29.434
Is it over?

10:33.355 --> 10:35.607
Okay.
I-I might have gone a little

10:35.691 --> 10:38.985
- too far this time.
- Well, Steven, you weren't

10:39.020 --> 10:40.411
completely wrong.
We learned something new because

10:40.446 --> 10:43.338
- of your decisions.
- All right!

10:43.373 --> 10:45.642
But, yeah, this
was a pretty bad idea.

10:45.677 --> 10:48.203
Aw, man.
