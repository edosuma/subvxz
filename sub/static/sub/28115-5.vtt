36:59.200 --> 37:01.520
Not long, actually.

37:01.560 --> 37:04.280
I was just-- I was just deciding

37:04.320 --> 37:07.560
whether there was any point
in talking to you...

37:07.600 --> 37:10.200
Sally.

37:10.240 --> 37:14.240
She told me all about you,
your mum.

37:14.280 --> 37:16.440
Painted a hell of a picture.

37:17.880 --> 37:21.000
But the thing is, I was there.

37:21.040 --> 37:22.600
I was there
cleaning up her shit.

37:22.640 --> 37:23.960
[crying]

37:24.000 --> 37:26.120
I was there to walk her
up and down the hallway

37:26.160 --> 37:28.320
because she couldn't stand
the sight of that ceiling.

37:28.360 --> 37:31.320
I was there when she died.

37:31.360 --> 37:34.200
I actually cared
enough about her tobe there.

37:35.240 --> 37:37.280
You didn't know her.

37:37.320 --> 37:39.120
[laughs]:
Oh, I bloody knew her

37:39.160 --> 37:40.720
better than you did.

37:40.760 --> 37:42.680
[whispering]: She's my mother.
How fucking dare you?

37:42.720 --> 37:46.560
I worked at the hospice
where she died.

37:46.600 --> 37:49.160
And you had no idea who I was.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.960
That's how much you cared.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.040
-I got back to see her
whenever I could.
-Oh, right.

37:54.080 --> 37:56.080
Every three months,
like clockwork.

37:56.120 --> 37:58.480
48 hours, and then
you're off again.

37:58.520 --> 38:00.680
You always talk about
doing good things, Judith,

38:00.720 --> 38:03.680
but do you actually give
a shit about anyone?

38:03.720 --> 38:07.160
You stole from me.
You stole from me.

38:07.200 --> 38:09.640
What, and now you're trying
to lecture me?

38:09.680 --> 38:13.880
I give and I give
and I help day and night.

38:13.920 --> 38:15.760
And I get nothing back.

38:15.800 --> 38:19.000
-So now it's my turn.
-How could you?

38:19.040 --> 38:24.280
How could you lie to me
all those nights?

38:24.320 --> 38:28.040
Honestly... it made it exciting.

38:28.080 --> 38:31.200
Lying there,
knowing what I was going to do.

38:31.240 --> 38:34.080
You did this, Judith.

38:34.120 --> 38:38.080
You left that beautiful
old woman to die alone.

38:38.120 --> 38:41.520
She was always alone.

38:41.560 --> 38:44.400
For good reason.
She made it that way.

38:44.440 --> 38:47.880
Well, we all make
the beds we lie in.

38:47.920 --> 38:50.400
Maybe that's the way you are.

38:50.440 --> 38:53.440
Smiles and kindness
on the outside,

38:53.480 --> 38:57.280
but on the inside you're angry.

38:57.320 --> 38:58.880
You're screaming.

38:58.920 --> 39:03.080
But maybe I've
set you free, Judith.

39:03.120 --> 39:06.120
Because I was
the one risk you took.

39:06.160 --> 39:09.560
I was the one time
you let someone in.

39:09.600 --> 39:13.800
You know what, I'm done.
You don't exist.

you were a salesman.

40:40.800 --> 40:43.360

From a government mine?

41:33.560 --> 41:36.880

41:36.920 --> 41:39.360
I lose millions

42:01.080 --> 42:04.240
It's got nothing to do
with my heart.

42:04.280 --> 42:06.920
It's a callous world
out there, Major General.

42:06.960 --> 42:10.640
Everyone's out for themselves,
skimming off the top.

Hands in someone else's pockets.

children like you.

back to Kinshasa.

43:06.480 --> 43:08.440
-I don't want to.
-They'll help you.

43:08.480 --> 43:10.880
They say they help you,
but this is not what they do.

I'm at her house now.

43:51.880 --> 43:54.600
-And?
-There's a problem, Georgia.

43:54.640 --> 43:56.760
Judith is dead.

43:56.800 --> 43:58.440
What?

43:58.480 --> 44:00.760
She was stabbed here,
in the house.

44:00.800 --> 44:03.400
The hospital thought
they'd saved her,

44:03.440 --> 44:09.200

an artery this morning, so...

GEORGIA:
Jesus, what now?

44:12.720 --> 44:15.080
We're gonna find
who planted that bomb.

44:15.120 --> 44:16.280
We'll figure this out.
