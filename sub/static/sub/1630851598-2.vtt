08:24.787 --> 08:27.919
[vocalizes Italian song]

08:28.987 --> 08:32.672
Now, we join Ellena
as she is about to begin

08:32.747 --> 08:34.112
her second life.

08:34.187 --> 08:36.312
Ellena! Right in front
of the electrical van.

08:36.387 --> 08:37.872
What I'm worried about
with her, Wayans,

08:37.947 --> 08:39.152
is the 7-foot jump.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.232
- All right!
- Ooh, wow.

08:40.307 --> 08:41.752
We'll take it.
Get up.

08:41.827 --> 08:43.072
You don't want to be roadkill,

08:43.147 --> 08:44.712
or as we call it, toad kill.

08:44.787 --> 08:46.432
Can she get to
the crosswalk button?

08:46.507 --> 08:47.872
All right, Ellena,
you're gonna have to

08:47.947 --> 08:49.312
get out of there fast,
though.

08:49.387 --> 08:51.192
- Another 7-footer.
- You gotta go, go, go!

08:51.267 --> 08:53.512
Don't go out of bounds!
Oh, that is a life.

08:53.587 --> 08:55.912
I cannot do this.

08:55.987 --> 08:58.032
You cannot take the course
around that curve.

08:58.041 --> 08:59.879
She loses life number two.

08:59.954 --> 09:03.632
Okay, Super Mom is back
with her second life

09:03.707 --> 09:05.632
as she faces off once more

09:05.641 --> 09:09.112
against
the Jean Claude Ram Vans.

09:09.121 --> 09:10.679
- Ooh!
- And good night.

09:10.754 --> 09:12.472
Down goes Mom.

09:12.547 --> 09:14.992
We love you, Nicole,
but that is life number two.

09:15.001 --> 09:16.752
And she left a dent
in that fender.

09:16.827 --> 09:19.239
[imitates kid]
"Mom! Where's the pizza?"

09:20.267 --> 09:21.239
"I'm hungry!"

09:21.314 --> 09:23.712
[imitates Nicole]
"I'm swimming!"

09:23.787 --> 09:26.272
"I'll get it when I get out!"

09:26.281 --> 09:28.472
Ellena is back and about to use

09:28.547 --> 09:30.792
her third and final
Frogger life.

09:30.867 --> 09:34.232
She has to make it further
than the Jean Claude Ram Vans

09:34.307 --> 09:36.959
or Nicole wins the crossing.

09:37.034 --> 09:38.112
Come on, you got this.

09:38.187 --> 09:39.479
She's really into "Flashdance,"

09:39.554 --> 09:41.559
which is remembered for
Jennifer Beals

09:41.634 --> 09:43.432
being doused in water.

09:43.507 --> 09:45.952
Wow. She must
be living her dream, then.

09:45.961 --> 09:47.912
She's done that routine,
at least once.

09:47.987 --> 09:49.319
Hopefully not again.

09:49.394 --> 09:51.672
Here she goes.

09:51.747 --> 09:53.079
She crosses--look out
for the cab!

09:53.154 --> 09:55.192
Onto the Croaklyn Bridge.
She's alive!

09:55.267 --> 09:56.279
- Okay.
- Well done.

09:56.354 --> 09:57.692
Excellently done.

09:57.767 --> 10:00.672
And now, she's gotta get
in front of Thunder Truck.

10:00.747 --> 10:03.272
Thunder Truck's still angry
Super Mom got by him.

10:03.347 --> 10:05.239
It's slippery!

10:07.601 --> 10:09.919
- She okay?
- Oh, no!

10:11.467 --> 10:14.879
What a way to go.
Ellena is done!

10:15.714 --> 10:16.672
Where'd she go?

10:16.747 --> 10:18.192
Uh...I don't know.

10:18.267 --> 10:19.512
Ellena!

10:19.587 --> 10:21.519
- There she is.
- Oh! Hey.

10:21.594 --> 10:23.032
She's alive.

10:23.041 --> 10:24.472
She just overjumped it.

10:24.547 --> 10:26.912
Look, she went
to another dimension.

10:26.921 --> 10:28.879
It's like...
[imitates game over sfx]

10:29.641 --> 10:32.279
Well, what can we say?
That's it for Ellena.

10:32.354 --> 10:34.952
She uses up her third
and final life

10:35.027 --> 10:36.432
failing to catch up
to Nicole.

10:36.507 --> 10:38.872
So Nicole wins,
with a life to spare!

10:38.947 --> 10:40.992
Nicole, congratulations.

10:41.067 --> 10:43.272
You are going to
the Boss Toad Bonus Round.

10:43.347 --> 10:43.952
How do you feel?

10:44.027 --> 10:46.312
Whoo! So excited!

10:46.387 --> 10:48.792
Mama did good, kids.
Well done.

10:48.867 --> 10:50.672
Yes!
- Congratulations to Nicole,

10:50.747 --> 10:53.272
who flexes her Mom Guns
and knocks out Ellena

10:53.347 --> 10:54.832
to become
tonight's first Frogger

10:54.841 --> 10:57.112
into the
Boss Toad Bonus Round.

10:57.187 --> 10:58.872
Who'll be joining her
to battle it out

10:58.947 --> 11:01.679
for the $10,000
Golden Fanny Pack?

11:01.754 --> 11:03.992
We're about to find out.

11:04.067 --> 11:04.919
- Uh, hey, Kyle?
- Yeah.

11:04.994 --> 11:06.479
You ticklish?

11:06.554 --> 11:07.799
Uh, I'm not answering that.

11:07.874 --> 11:09.192
There's not a good answer
to that question.

11:09.267 --> 11:10.912
- How do you mean?
- Well, if I say yes,

11:10.987 --> 11:12.912
then you tickle me.
If I say no,

11:12.987 --> 11:14.492
then you try to tickle me
to prove me wrong.

11:14.494 --> 11:16.432
- It's a classic catch-22.
- There's an alternative.

11:16.441 --> 11:18.712
- What? Really?
- Yeah. Works every time.

11:18.787 --> 11:20.432
Try me.

11:20.507 --> 11:21.672
Hey, Damon, are you--

11:21.747 --> 11:23.712
Aaah!

11:23.787 --> 11:26.519
[chuckles] Yeah.

11:26.594 --> 11:29.512
- Nobody tickles Crazy Damon.
- I'm out.

11:29.587 --> 11:30.919
That always works.

11:40.627 --> 11:43.112
All right, Wayans,
the bayou beckons.

11:43.187 --> 11:44.752
I hope our two Froggers
are ready

11:44.827 --> 11:48.432
for the flowing waters
of Ribbit River.

11:48.507 --> 11:51.552
Shout out to our dry ice guy.
Or girl. We got a great one.

11:51.627 --> 11:53.872
Just look at that.
Is that actually on fire?

11:53.947 --> 11:56.112
It's quite dangerous,
but I'm enjoying myself.

11:56.187 --> 11:57.839
Let's get to the crossing.

12:00.947 --> 12:02.952
Froggers must pass
the powerful jets

12:02.961 --> 12:05.552
of the waterfall,
then call for the turtles

12:05.627 --> 12:07.152
and jump a ride to the logs,

12:07.227 --> 12:11.192
or take a tough shortcut
through the Spinning Lilies.

12:11.267 --> 12:14.032
Once they've traversed
the up-and-down Loco Lilies,

12:14.107 --> 12:15.919
Froggers then need
to ride the gators

12:15.994 --> 12:18.392
and scale the rocks
before swinging home

12:18.467 --> 12:21.159
to the safety
of the landing pad.

12:22.347 --> 12:25.392
Cruel waters run deep
on Ribbit River.

12:25.467 --> 12:27.512
But will our Froggers
get swept away

12:27.587 --> 12:29.472
when they face...

12:29.547 --> 12:31.512
Jason Waterfalls?

12:31.587 --> 12:34.752
A brutal trip across
17-inch-wide stepping stones

12:34.827 --> 12:39.592
while being pummeled by
52 gallons of water per second.

12:39.667 --> 12:42.032
And the Spinning Lily.

12:42.041 --> 12:44.199
Rotating at 12 revolutions
per minute,

12:44.274 --> 12:47.479
it's a tempting shortcut
that will leave you dizzy.

12:49.067 --> 12:51.152
What a matchup we've got.

12:51.227 --> 12:52.239
All right, let's do this!

12:52.314 --> 12:53.992
[both yelling indistinctly]

12:54.001 --> 12:55.479
[both cheering]

12:56.507 --> 12:57.999
It's Frogger champ Ryan

12:58.074 --> 13:01.672
versus ballroom dancer Xander.

13:01.681 --> 13:03.752
Hello.
My name is Ryan Zlatniski.

13:03.827 --> 13:05.072
I'm 24 years old.

13:05.147 --> 13:08.032
I'm a little bit obsessed
with Frogger.

13:08.107 --> 13:11.432
I'm currently ranked
10th in the world at Frogger.

13:11.507 --> 13:14.959
It was not an easy feat,
but it's one I am proud of.

13:16.027 --> 13:17.432
You'd better
hop out of my way,

13:17.507 --> 13:19.959
'cause I am gonna leap
to that finish line.

13:21.267 --> 13:22.952
I'm Xander.
I'm 32 years old.

13:23.027 --> 13:24.352
I'm from New York,

13:24.427 --> 13:27.152
and I'm really good
at ballroom dancing.

13:27.227 --> 13:28.632
I know I can win Frogger

13:28.707 --> 13:29.712
because my secret weapon

13:29.787 --> 13:31.232
is all the Latin moves

13:31.307 --> 13:32.752
that I've learned
throughout ballroom dancing.

13:32.827 --> 13:35.152
Moving my hips,
moving my feet.

13:35.161 --> 13:37.839
I'm gonna win this.
Watch out.

13:38.714 --> 13:40.399
Don't slip and fall, bruh.

13:41.267 --> 13:42.712
Nah, that's more your speed.

13:42.721 --> 13:44.152
This is the ultimate test
of whether

13:44.227 --> 13:46.119
experience at
the videogame Frogger

13:46.194 --> 13:48.559
actually translates
to real-life Frogger.

13:49.587 --> 13:53.232
But Ryan's entire personality
is on the line, here.

13:53.307 --> 13:55.239
If the world's 10th best
Frogger player

13:55.314 --> 13:57.112
can't make it across
Ribbit River,

13:57.121 --> 13:58.959
they might not let him
back in the arcade.

14:00.667 --> 14:03.112
Ryan, hand on the joystick,

14:03.187 --> 14:04.992
one of the world's foremost
Frogger players

14:05.067 --> 14:07.152
doing it in real life, Wayans.

14:07.227 --> 14:08.999
XANDER: All right, buddy.

14:10.427 --> 14:13.752
Off we go, Ryan,
directly into the waterfall.

14:13.827 --> 14:16.439
The Froggers have to pass over
the stepping stones.

14:16.514 --> 14:17.952
It is slippery, be careful.

14:18.027 --> 14:19.832
We call it Jason Waterfalls,

14:19.907 --> 14:22.472
a punishing barrage
of water cannons.

14:22.547 --> 14:25.352
300 gallons of water
per millisecond.

14:25.427 --> 14:28.832
I think he's already realizing
this is not an arcade game.

14:28.907 --> 14:31.672
- Ohh! Oh, my God!
- This is real.

14:31.747 --> 14:33.312
Tenth best
Frogger in the world,

14:33.387 --> 14:35.359
The other nine are looking on
with bated breath at home.

14:35.434 --> 14:37.072
They don't want to fall
in the rankings

14:37.081 --> 14:39.159
'Cause Ryan could make them
plummet right here.

14:39.234 --> 14:40.832
Beautiful legs,
beautiful twitch.

14:40.907 --> 14:42.792
We're already in
a perilous situation.

14:42.867 --> 14:43.992
I hope he falls,
I hope he falls.

14:44.067 --> 14:45.792
- Oh, no!
- He's over!

14:45.867 --> 14:47.832
- What you're supposed to do.
- Absolutely beautiful!

14:47.907 --> 14:49.632
That's how you play!

14:49.707 --> 14:51.072
Let's go, turtles! Whoo!

14:51.147 --> 14:52.392
And with this kind of a course,

14:52.467 --> 14:53.752
the Froggers have to do
a mating call.

14:53.827 --> 14:55.719
And our turtles,
Tommy and Tony,

14:55.794 --> 14:57.112
will spring
right into action...

14:57.187 --> 14:59.032
- Whoo!
- ...looking for a mate.

14:59.107 --> 15:02.512
Let's go! Let's rock!
Ah-ooga!

15:02.521 --> 15:03.952
Ah-wooga!

15:04.027 --> 15:05.912
- Please. Please.
- Let it all out!

15:05.987 --> 15:07.552
Let's rock! Let's rock!

15:07.627 --> 15:10.992
Ah-wooga! Ah-wooga!

15:11.067 --> 15:13.552
- Oh, whoa, okay.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:13.627 --> 15:14.892
He's hungry.

15:14.967 --> 15:16.352
Come on over here.
Come on!

15:16.427 --> 15:18.839
I don't know, that turtle's
moving a little fast!

15:20.161 --> 15:21.792
Oh, my God,
he made it look easy.

15:21.867 --> 15:23.552
Are you ready?
Take me to my home.

15:23.627 --> 15:25.552
Take me to my home!

15:25.627 --> 15:27.032
Don't miss that lily!

15:27.107 --> 15:29.752
Now, our Froggers can jump
to the Spinning Lily Pad,

15:29.827 --> 15:33.192
our shortcut--it'll make a
shorter journey across the logs.

15:33.267 --> 15:35.352
But if you go on
to Tony Turtle,

15:35.427 --> 15:38.399
it's sort of
the more scenic route.

15:39.627 --> 15:41.672
And we're onto the lily pad!
All right!

15:41.747 --> 15:43.032
groans]

15:43.107 --> 15:44.632
That is the short cut,
which means now

15:44.707 --> 15:46.952
he's got less work to do,
but he's gotta jump on

15:47.027 --> 15:49.672
one of those 14-foot logs.
They're 2 1/2 feet wide.

15:49.747 --> 15:52.312
They are way, way more
challenging than they look.

15:52.387 --> 15:55.352
The shortcut is deceptively
alluring.

15:55.427 --> 15:57.272
It is!
You wanna grab that thing.

15:57.281 --> 15:58.792
It's kind of like the--
you know, the carpool lane

15:58.867 --> 16:00.119
- in LA, usually.
- Yeah.

16:00.194 --> 16:01.472
"Come on over here.
No one'll see you.

16:01.547 --> 16:03.032
No one'll see you.
You'll get home faster."

16:03.041 --> 16:04.512
- And then, traffic.
- [imitates police siren]

16:04.587 --> 16:05.552
- Oh.
- Oh, no.

16:05.627 --> 16:06.999
I wish it was traffic!

16:08.467 --> 16:10.472
Don't forget to jump on
that log, buddy!

16:10.547 --> 16:12.072
It gets you dizzy real fast.

16:12.147 --> 16:14.359
Just watching him,
I'm nauseous.

16:15.427 --> 16:16.752
BOTH: Oh!

16:16.827 --> 16:18.832
Frogger down! In the water!

16:18.841 --> 16:20.919
He was doing so well!

16:20.994 --> 16:22.312
Ryan Zlatniski,

16:22.387 --> 16:23.992
no one knows this game
better, of course.

16:24.067 --> 16:25.272
The world's champion
Frogger player.

16:25.347 --> 16:26.952
Three lives,
and he just spent one.

16:27.027 --> 16:28.712
I bet he needs a cheat code
about now.

16:28.787 --> 16:29.952
Um, I'm not gonna lie.

16:30.027 --> 16:31.952
I'm impressed with
how far he got.

16:32.027 --> 16:33.712
- It's a quality first life.
- Yeah.

16:33.787 --> 16:36.559
Two left to go, unless
Xander's some sort of genius.

16:37.427 --> 16:39.119
Hey, can we talk about
Xander's apparel?

16:39.194 --> 16:42.352
These are sort of
Ultimate Warrior-esque armbands

16:42.427 --> 16:43.752
hanging off of him, but
we've never seen that before.

16:43.827 --> 16:45.312
I don't know.
I like it.

16:45.387 --> 16:47.552
Wonder if they could use them
like some sort of lanyard

16:47.627 --> 16:48.719
or rope or something.

16:48.794 --> 16:50.559
Let's do this!

16:50.634 --> 16:53.112
Xander the Ballroom Dancer,
promenade position,

16:53.187 --> 16:57.352
start the music,
and let's Xan-a-do this.

16:57.427 --> 16:58.952
He is off.

16:59.027 --> 17:00.512
Already a little bit
of a stumble,

17:00.521 --> 17:02.799
not short of enthusiasm here.

17:02.874 --> 17:04.432
Get ready to get wet!

17:04.441 --> 17:05.985
Watch out for the cannons.

17:06.061 --> 17:07.712
They will knock you
into next week.

17:07.787 --> 17:09.119
- Whoa.
- Uh-oh.

17:10.147 --> 17:11.919
Those rocks are slippery!

17:14.067 --> 17:15.952
[all groan]

17:15.961 --> 17:17.719
- Faceplant onto that.
- Wow.

17:17.794 --> 17:20.032
- I'm nervous already.
- Xander.

17:20.107 --> 17:22.152
Oh, Xander, we love ya!

17:22.227 --> 17:24.352
- We got a human bridge!
- Ballroom dancing--

17:24.427 --> 17:26.632
oh, he's getting wrecked
by the water.

17:26.707 --> 17:28.999
Olivia Newton, where are you
when we need you?

17:29.074 --> 17:30.759
Come on! Come on!

17:33.361 --> 17:35.152
- And he's alive!
- All right.

17:35.227 --> 17:36.952
- Xander lives!
- Okay!

17:37.027 --> 17:38.512
Have you got a mating call?

17:38.587 --> 17:40.752
Come on, turtles, let's go!

17:40.827 --> 17:42.392
I'll dance for you!

17:42.467 --> 17:44.552
Rewind that. Play it slow
and to music.

17:44.627 --> 17:45.712
[fast rewinding]

17:45.787 --> 17:49.392
[slow-mo]
I'll dance for you!

17:49.401 --> 17:50.999
I expected more
out of a ballroom dancer.

17:51.074 --> 17:52.952
I would've thought so, too.

17:53.027 --> 17:55.152
This is what we call
Turtle Town.

17:55.227 --> 17:57.519
Come on, little buddy.
I got you.

18:00.147 --> 18:02.592
- Whoa!
- My goodness, he almost...

18:02.667 --> 18:04.472
On a turtle.
Who is my buddy.

18:04.547 --> 18:06.112
Everything's sloppy with him,
right?

18:06.121 --> 18:07.352
- Yeah, yeah.
- It's kinda fun!

18:07.427 --> 18:09.232
- Here we go.
- BOTH: Oh!

18:09.307 --> 18:11.352
- [laughter]
- Right to the shortcut!

18:11.427 --> 18:12.712
Right to the shortcut!

18:12.787 --> 18:15.072
I feel like a lot of people
are taking the shortcut.

18:15.147 --> 18:17.472
Xander makes the shortcut leap,

18:17.547 --> 18:19.552
and is now tied with Ryan.

18:19.561 --> 18:20.679
Can he take the lead?

18:20.754 --> 18:22.519
Spinning!
It's spinning!

18:22.594 --> 18:24.112
I don't think you'll make it!

18:24.187 --> 18:25.792
Really getting into his head,
wow!

18:25.801 --> 18:27.039
Look at that,
they're spinning

18:27.114 --> 18:28.432
like a pizza cutter
right there.

18:28.507 --> 18:29.992
- Whoa! Just kidding.
- And he's almost

18:30.067 --> 18:31.512
going over the side.
Xander,

18:31.587 --> 18:33.392
I got nerves right now, buddy.

18:33.467 --> 18:35.832
Lily pad...and...

18:35.907 --> 18:38.352
- [grunts]
- BOTH: Oh!

18:38.427 --> 18:39.752
That one was mean.

18:39.827 --> 18:41.312
[cheering]

18:41.387 --> 18:43.712
Ryan is very excited
right now.

18:43.787 --> 18:45.232
Yes, he is.
He should be,

18:45.307 --> 18:46.752
because that's one life apiece.

18:46.827 --> 18:49.592
One life down,
both Xander and Ryan

18:49.667 --> 18:51.632
at the exact same spot.

18:51.707 --> 18:53.752
The exact same number of lives.

18:53.761 --> 18:56.352
I think they call this a tie.

18:56.427 --> 18:58.199
You don't have a chance.

19:08.987 --> 19:09.992
Don't land on your head!

19:10.067 --> 19:11.232
Do you wish to play again?

19:11.307 --> 19:13.432
Ryan selects "Y" for "yes."

19:13.507 --> 19:16.312
Ryan starts where he failed,
on the Spinning Lily.

19:16.387 --> 19:19.672
Now on his second life.
Here he goes!

19:19.747 --> 19:21.992
And he is off and he is down!

19:22.067 --> 19:24.592
Ryan falls short again.

19:24.667 --> 19:26.192
Kind of like being a plumber,

19:26.267 --> 19:28.832
and being bad
at Super Mario Bros? Like...

19:28.907 --> 19:30.232
If you can plumb,
you gotta play with Mario.

19:30.307 --> 19:33.599
Xander Duff.
Second life.

19:34.634 --> 19:36.165
I know he's used to spinning.

19:36.167 --> 19:37.272
I feel like he should have
a rose in his mouth

19:37.347 --> 19:38.519
right now or something,
Wayans.

19:38.594 --> 19:40.392
He's gonna need it.
And he's off!

19:40.467 --> 19:42.839
And he's down.

19:42.914 --> 19:45.232
No good! No good!

19:45.307 --> 19:47.232
I don't know if this is
working out for these gentlemen.

19:47.307 --> 19:50.392
We've had four combined deaths
on the exact same spot.

19:50.467 --> 19:53.279
It's almost haunted,
this lily pad at this point.

19:56.587 --> 19:58.992
24-year-old Ryan Zlatniski.

19:59.067 --> 20:00.352
Third and final life.

20:00.427 --> 20:02.672
He is back on
the Spinning Lily

20:02.747 --> 20:04.792
that claimed his second life.

20:04.867 --> 20:07.072
Plays Frogger every morning,

20:07.081 --> 20:09.192
tenth-ranked player
in the world.

20:09.201 --> 20:11.392
Has played countless hours
of this game.

20:11.467 --> 20:14.112
This is the biggest jump
he has ever attempted.

20:14.187 --> 20:15.392
Oh, boy.

20:15.467 --> 20:16.632
You know, this is Ryan's
first time

20:16.707 --> 20:17.879
playing 3-D Frogger?

20:17.954 --> 20:19.239
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:19.314 --> 20:21.112
Doesn't surprise me.
Might be his last

20:21.187 --> 20:22.599
if he doesn't make this jump.

20:23.747 --> 20:25.199
Ladies and gentlemen,
here comes the moment.

20:25.274 --> 20:27.639
He's done at least 57 spins
on this lily pad

20:27.714 --> 20:29.192
and here's the jump for all--

20:29.267 --> 20:31.479
And he's on top!
Ryan lives!

20:31.554 --> 20:34.112
Ryan is alive!
He stuck the landing.

20:34.187 --> 20:36.112
- Ryan!
- Get yourself up! Come on.

20:36.187 --> 20:37.719
- Come on.
- Ryan!

20:37.794 --> 20:39.192
- All right!
- Wow!

20:39.201 --> 20:40.359
[exhales]

20:40.434 --> 20:41.952
And here we go.

20:42.027 --> 20:44.472
24-year-old Ryan Zlatniski.

20:44.547 --> 20:47.192
Tenth-ranked Frogger player
in the world.

20:47.201 --> 20:50.032
Take a moment,
because these are known

20:50.041 --> 20:51.752
as the Loco Lilies,

20:51.761 --> 20:52.959
'cause they crazy.

20:54.147 --> 20:55.392
Now he's backtracking.

20:55.467 --> 20:56.992
Ryan's gonna use
every inch of this log.

20:57.067 --> 20:58.392
Wayans, you love a runway.

20:58.467 --> 21:00.392
He's gonna get
a full running start.

21:00.467 --> 21:04.152
Wow, man.
This guy may really be

21:04.227 --> 21:06.399
the tenth-greatest Frogger
of all time.

21:07.547 --> 21:08.992
- Here we go! Three...
- Here we go. Here we go.

21:09.067 --> 21:10.792
Two, one...

21:10.867 --> 21:12.792
- Whoa!
- Oh, what?

21:12.867 --> 21:14.592
You need elevation as well.

21:14.667 --> 21:16.552
You can't just drive
into the parking lot?

21:16.627 --> 21:17.992
[laughs] No!

21:18.067 --> 21:20.159
What a moment.

21:20.234 --> 21:21.472
That sprinter's start
is ironic.

21:21.481 --> 21:23.192
He's actually running
the hurdles,

21:23.201 --> 21:24.992
and he just decided to just
run right through them

21:25.067 --> 21:26.279
or rather into them.

21:26.354 --> 21:27.999
Just give the lily pad
a chest bump.

21:28.074 --> 21:29.992
Right into it, yeah.
Just a flying chest bump.

21:30.001 --> 21:31.399
"Hey, man! What's up, bro?"

21:31.474 --> 21:33.832
- "Yo dude, what up?"
- "I'm out! All right."

21:33.907 --> 21:36.319
The chest bump said
"Sit down, bro."

21:37.547 --> 21:39.112
- Xander.
- Hello.

21:39.187 --> 21:41.352
This is your third
and final life.

21:41.427 --> 21:44.912
I know. I think my tassels
are getting in the way?

21:44.987 --> 21:47.072
So I'm just gonna like
tuck them in.

21:47.147 --> 21:48.792
I think they're ruining
my mobility.

21:48.867 --> 21:50.132
I still think
he could've used them

21:50.134 --> 21:51.392
as some sort
of Spider-Man thing,

21:51.467 --> 21:52.832
but we'll never know.

21:52.907 --> 21:55.632
Xander Duff,
ladies and gentlemen.

21:55.707 --> 21:58.552
Looking to toe-tap his way
onto the log.

21:58.627 --> 22:00.712
Remember, he'll need to get
past it for the win.

22:00.787 --> 22:02.992
Hold on.
Do it one more time.

22:03.001 --> 22:04.392
And...aah.

22:04.467 --> 22:05.992
I'm psyching myself
out here.

22:06.067 --> 22:09.312
A 6-foot jump
from an only 2 1/2-foot wide

22:09.387 --> 22:13.352
Spinning Lily Pad,
Xander has to reach the log

22:13.427 --> 22:15.112
to stay alive.

22:15.187 --> 22:17.999
Can he do it?
Can he do it?

22:18.074 --> 22:19.839
I don't think he can.

22:21.267 --> 22:24.552
- Xander...down.
- Whoo!

22:24.627 --> 22:25.752
Get out of here.

22:25.761 --> 22:27.392
Let the tassels out,
my friend.

22:27.467 --> 22:28.792
You're done!

22:28.867 --> 22:32.072
Xander, a hell of a Frogger,

22:32.147 --> 22:33.392
but Ryan goes on!

22:33.467 --> 22:35.752
Hop like a frog!
[indistinct]

22:35.827 --> 22:38.032
Oh! Oh! Oh! Aah!

22:38.107 --> 22:39.552
- Yeah!
- Wow.

22:39.627 --> 22:41.152
He literally frog danced.

22:41.227 --> 22:43.392
Well played, my friend.

22:43.467 --> 22:45.192
Well played.

22:45.201 --> 22:48.592
Frogger king!
Frogger king here.

22:48.667 --> 22:50.232
Ryan will be now allowed
back into

22:50.307 --> 22:51.712
the Frogger message boards.

22:51.787 --> 22:53.312
They were gonna ban him
for life.

22:53.387 --> 22:56.152
And he is now through
to the Boss Toad Bonus Round.

22:56.227 --> 22:58.072
Who'll be joining him
in tonight's showdown?

22:58.147 --> 23:00.272
We're about to find out.

23:00.347 --> 23:03.159
Everybody start the countdown,
because it's time

23:03.234 --> 23:05.479
for Frogs in Space.

23:06.707 --> 23:08.639
Looking at frogs in space,
it always reminds me

23:08.714 --> 23:10.872
of back when I was a kid
and I wanted to be an astronaut.

23:10.947 --> 23:12.872
Yeah, I wanted to be
an astronaut, too.

23:12.947 --> 23:14.425
For like five minutes.

23:14.501 --> 23:16.592
Ah, well, what were
your other childhood dreams?

23:16.601 --> 23:18.159
You know, the classics.

23:18.234 --> 23:21.792
Firefighter, uh,
professional wrestler.

23:21.867 --> 23:23.632
BOTH: Lion tamer.

23:23.641 --> 23:25.672
- Bro!
- Dude.

23:25.747 --> 23:27.639
[both laugh]

23:27.714 --> 23:28.952
Bouncing to the craters,

23:29.027 --> 23:30.639
Froggers will climb
the satellite

23:30.714 --> 23:32.192
to start the launch sequence,

23:32.201 --> 23:34.192
then hit
the lighted countdown pads

23:34.267 --> 23:37.079
in the right order
as they complete the course.

23:37.154 --> 23:38.879
They'll have to leap
from the second satellite

23:38.954 --> 23:41.032
to the Spinning
Space Amphibian,

23:41.041 --> 23:42.832
dodge the Space Jets,

23:42.841 --> 23:44.912
and inch around
the Galaxy Hopper

23:44.987 --> 23:46.352
before facing the Space Worms

23:46.427 --> 23:48.999
on their way
to the landing pad.

23:54.547 --> 23:56.512
This crossing might be
out of this world,

23:56.521 --> 23:59.352
but these obstacles
will bring our Froggers

23:59.427 --> 24:00.959
back to earth.

24:01.034 --> 24:03.079
The Space Amphibians,

24:03.154 --> 24:04.792
a huge 5-foot jump

24:04.867 --> 24:06.792
onto an uneven,
spinning target.

24:06.867 --> 24:09.272
Timing and height
are everything.

24:09.347 --> 24:11.999
And Croaknik Station--

24:12.074 --> 24:15.072
an 18-foot traverse
past the opening golden doors.

24:15.147 --> 24:16.792
Be nimble, be quick!

24:16.867 --> 24:19.192
Or your crossing could be over.

24:19.267 --> 24:20.472
But remember, Froggers,

24:20.547 --> 24:24.559
in space, no one can
hear you scheme.

24:24.634 --> 24:25.992
Here we go.

24:26.067 --> 24:27.392
Tonight's last head-to-head,

24:27.467 --> 24:30.999
it's Dancer Melody
versus Aerialist Jackie.

24:32.467 --> 24:34.832
Hi, my named is
Melody Almé Byrd

24:34.907 --> 24:37.079
and I'm 24-year-old
choreographer

24:37.154 --> 24:40.552
living in the great city of
Los Angeles, California.

24:40.627 --> 24:44.392
People always say, can I sing
because my name is Melody?

24:44.401 --> 24:46.319
And the answer is yes!

24:55.314 --> 24:57.072
Hi, I'm Jackie.
I'm 30 years old

24:57.147 --> 24:58.359
and I'm an aerialist.

24:58.434 --> 25:01.152
It's a combo
of this creative dance

25:01.227 --> 25:03.792
but the strength and acrobatics
of circus.

25:03.867 --> 25:05.192
It's just beautiful.

25:05.267 --> 25:08.072
People underestimate me
because I'm small.

25:08.147 --> 25:10.272
I'm only 5'2", but I'm strong.

25:10.347 --> 25:12.839
I've got a little bit
of an edge, so watch out.

25:13.747 --> 25:15.152
- Whoo!
- Melody Byrd,

25:15.227 --> 25:17.199
the dance choreographer
is looking to

25:17.274 --> 25:20.559
set a tempo of allegro
here on Frogs in Space.

25:23.867 --> 25:25.112
All right, girl!

25:25.187 --> 25:26.312
She's already off!

25:26.387 --> 25:27.839
Right on
to the Crustacean Craters.

25:27.914 --> 25:29.912
The cameras can barely
keep up with her.

25:29.987 --> 25:30.992
[laughter]

25:31.067 --> 25:33.912
Melody Byrd, already on to

25:33.987 --> 25:35.432
the second
space rocket booster.

25:35.507 --> 25:36.952
This is awesome.

25:37.027 --> 25:39.192
That thing does not look easy
to climb on.

25:39.201 --> 25:42.152
- Uh-oh.
- Hold on, Melody.

25:42.227 --> 25:43.152
[exhales]

25:43.227 --> 25:44.592
To set off the launch sequence,

25:44.667 --> 25:46.992
you gotta scale this thing
one way or another,

25:47.067 --> 25:48.479
and set off that light
at the top.

25:48.554 --> 25:51.799
That will activate all five
countdown platforms.

25:52.867 --> 25:54.799
Will she make it to the top?

25:55.634 --> 25:57.119
Whoo!

25:57.194 --> 25:58.632
- Yes! Absolutely!
- The light has been released!

25:58.707 --> 26:01.632
Launch sequence activated.

26:01.707 --> 26:03.032
I love the way it lights up.

26:03.107 --> 26:04.672
It's beautiful.
Melody Byrd, already

26:04.681 --> 26:06.192
putting together a nice little
cross in here

26:06.267 --> 26:07.959
on life number one.

26:09.467 --> 26:10.559
T-minus five.

26:10.634 --> 26:12.999
She stomped on that thing
with authority!

26:13.874 --> 26:15.432
Oh! Oh, no.

26:15.507 --> 26:16.999
So close, so close!

26:17.074 --> 26:19.432
That looked like it "hoit"!

26:19.507 --> 26:20.992
That was a close one.

26:21.067 --> 26:22.392
Well, it's fascinating
she's losing her footing,

26:22.467 --> 26:25.112
because she has
these superhero feet, right?

26:25.187 --> 26:27.312
She can grab anything,
but man,

26:27.387 --> 26:30.112
that was some kind of
choreography she just worked.

26:30.121 --> 26:32.592
Now you are 9 feet off
the surface of the water.

26:32.667 --> 26:33.952
It's a long way down.

26:33.961 --> 26:35.392
She's going straight
from X to O.

26:35.467 --> 26:37.199
She is going from X to O.

26:37.274 --> 26:38.552
Kisses and hugs.

26:38.627 --> 26:40.199
You can do this.

26:43.187 --> 26:44.072
Oh!

26:44.147 --> 26:46.039
And she's down!

26:48.267 --> 26:49.432
- This is a little scooty.
- Yeah.

26:49.507 --> 26:50.512
Like a kid off the end
of a bench?

26:50.587 --> 26:52.272
Tried to ballet it,

26:52.347 --> 26:54.632
and then she got Black Swanned.

26:54.707 --> 26:56.392
Ha! Almost.

26:56.467 --> 26:59.072
One life down
for Melody Byrd.

26:59.147 --> 27:02.632
Now, Jackie Chang steps up
to the plate.

27:02.641 --> 27:06.592
Does she have what it takes
to conquer Frogs in Space?

27:06.667 --> 27:09.512
She's 5'2", 118 pounds.

27:09.587 --> 27:10.912
This is a huge jump.

27:10.987 --> 27:12.879
Oh, my God.

27:23.627 --> 27:25.479
Whoo!
Gotta breathe.

27:26.707 --> 27:27.879
Ready Frogger Two?

27:27.954 --> 27:30.639
- Ready!
- Here we go!

27:32.274 --> 27:34.632
Jackie Chang from the great
Garden State of New Jersey,

27:34.707 --> 27:37.912
works in user experience
and attempts to log on

27:37.987 --> 27:39.832
and she has connected.

27:39.841 --> 27:44.032
Jackie Chang was actually
named after Jackie Onassis.

27:44.041 --> 27:45.952
Is that right? Because
you hear Jackie Chang,

27:46.027 --> 27:47.399
and you think
"Rumble in the Bronx,"

27:47.474 --> 27:49.432
- "Shanghai Nights."
- Yeah, she says she's heard

27:49.507 --> 27:52.072
every iteration of those kind
of jokes, by the way.

27:52.147 --> 27:53.632
You got it, ninja!

27:53.641 --> 27:55.152
You made it look easy!

27:55.227 --> 27:57.632
Legend in Hong Kong
Jackie Chang

27:57.641 --> 27:59.992
looking to become a legend
on Frogs in Space.

28:00.067 --> 28:02.432
- Love me some Jackie Chan.
- Who doesn't?

28:02.441 --> 28:04.279
And I gotta go
for the light on top.

28:05.587 --> 28:06.832
Here we go, bit of magic.

28:06.907 --> 28:08.632
She pulls that plutonium
out and we got it!

28:08.707 --> 28:12.232
- Whoo!
- Launch sequence activated.

28:12.307 --> 28:14.999
1.21 gigawatts of power.

28:15.074 --> 28:18.032
Trying to get to
Countdown Platform 5.

28:18.107 --> 28:20.039
Come on, Jackie.
Get down on the side, girl!

28:23.307 --> 28:25.032
- Whoo! All right!
- T-minus five.

28:25.107 --> 28:26.912
Okay, this is the hard part
right here.

28:26.987 --> 28:28.912
All right, you can do it.

28:28.921 --> 28:30.345
She was like a speed demon
initially,

28:30.421 --> 28:31.952
and now she's like,
"You know what?

28:32.027 --> 28:33.192
- I gotta be careful here."
- All right.

28:33.267 --> 28:35.232
This thing looks tricky.

28:35.307 --> 28:37.632
Let's see if she learned
from Melody.

28:37.707 --> 28:39.512
Let's see if there's any give.

28:39.587 --> 28:41.152
All right, she's gonna do it
a little differently.

28:41.227 --> 28:42.512
She's doing the frog.

28:42.587 --> 28:45.552
She's in the classic
frog squat position.

28:45.627 --> 28:46.632
- Okay.
- Here she goes.

28:46.707 --> 28:48.999
Three, two...

28:49.074 --> 28:50.632
- one.
- Snap it. Screencap it.

28:50.707 --> 28:53.672
- All right! Graceful.
- Wow, great job, man.

28:53.747 --> 28:54.952
Oh, my God!

28:55.027 --> 28:57.519
Spinning Space Amphibian
waiting for her,

28:57.594 --> 28:59.392
one of the tougher jumps
in this entire crossing.

28:59.467 --> 29:02.519
This is a 5-foot jump
onto a moving target.

29:02.594 --> 29:06.032
- ...two, one.
- And off she goes!

29:06.107 --> 29:07.799
- Great job!
- Oh, shoot.

29:07.874 --> 29:10.072
Here come the cannons.

29:10.147 --> 29:11.832
Those cannons are relentless.

29:11.841 --> 29:13.152
- Wow!
- Unbelievable!

29:13.227 --> 29:15.272
- Wow!
- She made it look easy!

29:15.347 --> 29:18.032
- Jackie Chang came to play!
- Absolutely.

29:18.107 --> 29:20.879
Can she get
to Countdown Platform 4?

29:21.707 --> 29:23.832
Three, two, one.

29:23.841 --> 29:25.359
And she's off--got it!

29:26.267 --> 29:29.952
T-minus 4.
Space station activated.

29:30.027 --> 29:32.152
That thing is freaking me out!
Okay, wait.

29:32.161 --> 29:35.232
Three, two, one! Jump!

29:35.307 --> 29:38.032
Encouraged by Melody,
she makes it.

29:38.041 --> 29:40.032
Welcome up to Croaknik.

29:40.107 --> 29:42.432
Croaknik has four
opening doors.

29:42.507 --> 29:46.072
These things open and shut
every two seconds exactly.

29:46.081 --> 29:47.912
You've gotta move quickly.

29:47.987 --> 29:50.032
You hit the doors,
you hit the water.

29:50.041 --> 29:51.552
[indistinct]

29:51.627 --> 29:53.112
[laughs]

29:53.187 --> 29:55.879
Two, three, go.

29:55.954 --> 29:58.632
Two, three,

29:58.707 --> 30:00.192
go!

30:00.201 --> 30:02.432
Gonna have to rely on
your elusiveness

30:02.507 --> 30:04.399
and quickness
to beat those doors.

30:04.474 --> 30:07.432
Oh, those things are gonna
knock her down.

30:07.507 --> 30:10.272
- [squeals]
- [hosts groan]

30:10.347 --> 30:11.879
Jackie!

30:12.907 --> 30:15.352
Kind of like how these doors
just take people out sometimes.

30:15.427 --> 30:17.232
- They don't care, do they?
- No, they're just like,

30:17.307 --> 30:19.119
"You know what? Somebody's
standing right there."

30:19.194 --> 30:21.559
"Who?" And then
they're in the water.

30:22.841 --> 30:25.752
Now, Melody back
for her second life.

30:25.761 --> 30:28.872
She has to make it
past the doors

30:28.947 --> 30:30.152
to take the lead.

30:30.161 --> 30:32.432
She's Ground Control
to Major Frog,

30:32.507 --> 30:34.752
and she is off,
and she's got it!

30:34.827 --> 30:36.399
- Easy!
- All right.

30:37.747 --> 30:38.712
- Oh!
- And she's alive--

30:38.787 --> 30:40.599
Oh, she's gonna--she's down.

30:44.107 --> 30:45.632
That was an awkward fall,
wasn't it?

30:45.707 --> 30:47.952
Caught it half body up,
half body down,

30:48.027 --> 30:49.232
and Melody's in trouble.

30:49.307 --> 30:52.192
Jackie can eliminate her
if she crosses.

30:52.267 --> 30:54.832
Let's see if Jackie's got
that killer instinct.

30:54.907 --> 30:56.032
She can finish this thing.

30:56.107 --> 30:57.832
Jackie Chang.

30:57.841 --> 30:59.432
Concentrating.

30:59.507 --> 31:02.399
Focused.

31:02.474 --> 31:03.592
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

31:03.601 --> 31:05.432
- And, oh!
- Wow!

31:05.507 --> 31:07.392
That's that balance
right there, man.

31:07.467 --> 31:09.199
- Really good.
- Oh, my God!

31:09.274 --> 31:11.159
It's a piece of cake, Jack!

31:12.467 --> 31:15.232
This is at least
a 7-, 8-foot jump.

31:15.307 --> 31:17.192
She's gonna go for it!

31:17.267 --> 31:19.072
- And she's got it!
- Wow!

31:19.081 --> 31:23.712
Now, she's gotta make it past
those pesky Space Worms.

31:23.787 --> 31:26.832
Every jump's a big jump
for her.

31:26.907 --> 31:28.792
She's made it, Wayans.
She's alive.

31:28.867 --> 31:30.112
Ah, they're so much farther!

31:30.187 --> 31:31.592
Every inch matters.

31:31.667 --> 31:34.432
This is the home stretch
of Frogs in Space.

31:34.507 --> 31:35.699
This is Churchill Downs.

31:36.474 --> 31:38.839
- Let's go!
- I know, I'm going!

31:39.747 --> 31:42.599
All right, this is a 5-foot jump
to a 2 1/2 foot diameter

31:42.674 --> 31:45.039
and she's got--oh!

31:46.307 --> 31:49.312
And just like that,
Jackie loses her balance

31:49.321 --> 31:52.152
trying to avoid
the evil Space Worm.

31:52.227 --> 31:54.432
She was unsteady,
and that worm said, "Boop!"

31:54.507 --> 31:56.832
Jackie Chang,
two lives into the water.

31:56.907 --> 31:59.232
Huge lead,
but down to her last life.

31:59.307 --> 32:00.532
Yay!

32:00.534 --> 32:02.832
Melody says,
"I'm still playing Frogger!"

32:02.907 --> 32:05.312
Melody is so happy right now.

32:05.387 --> 32:09.312
Melody needs to reach
the first Space Worm.

32:09.387 --> 32:11.272
That is her end zone right now.

32:11.347 --> 32:13.832
If she doesn't, she's out,

32:13.841 --> 32:15.519
Jackie Chang wins.

32:16.747 --> 32:18.999
Frog in the background
does not look confident.

32:19.074 --> 32:21.839
Absolutely petrified,
that frog.

32:22.681 --> 32:25.352
She's off...
and she's down!

32:25.361 --> 32:30.112
Oh, into the water,
and Melody, Wayans, is out.

32:30.187 --> 32:31.379
- You know what that means?
- What's that mean?

32:31.381 --> 32:33.432
- Jackie Chang...
- Thank you!

32:33.507 --> 32:36.999
is going to
the Boss Toad Bonus Round.

32:37.074 --> 32:39.512
Congratulations to Jackie.
She moves on.

32:39.587 --> 32:42.952
We have got a showdown
coming up, my friends.

32:43.027 --> 32:44.832
Who's taking home
that Golden Fanny Pack?

32:44.907 --> 32:46.239
Why don't we find out?

32:58.467 --> 33:01.999
He's the enemy
of all Froggers.

33:04.147 --> 33:06.472
He strikes fear in the hearts

33:06.547 --> 33:08.479
of baby froglets.

33:09.674 --> 33:14.479
It is rumored he invented
the term, "Game Over."

33:15.434 --> 33:17.472
He is...

33:17.547 --> 33:19.479
Boss Toad.

33:22.387 --> 33:24.239
Pinch your nose, everyone.

33:26.147 --> 33:28.039
Uch. This guy.

33:30.434 --> 33:32.672
So stinky.

33:32.747 --> 33:33.719
[farts]

33:33.794 --> 33:36.472
- I don't like him.
- Mm-mm.

33:36.547 --> 33:38.312
What's worse is that
he's frognapped

33:38.387 --> 33:39.992
five froglets and hidden them

33:40.067 --> 33:42.279
across the most challenging
Frogger crossing of them all,

33:42.354 --> 33:44.312
the Boss Toad Temple.
It happened.

33:44.387 --> 33:46.112
Our Froggers each get
five minutes

33:46.187 --> 33:48.432
to rescue those froglets,
as many as they can,

33:48.507 --> 33:51.032
and then they can choose
any route they want

33:51.107 --> 33:52.992
to get the job done.

33:53.067 --> 33:54.232
But they only have one life,

33:54.307 --> 33:56.879
so if they fall in,
game over.

33:58.227 --> 33:59.672
Tonight's winner takes home

33:59.747 --> 34:02.072
the $10,000 Golden Fanny Pack

34:02.147 --> 34:03.872
and will also go on
to compete

34:03.881 --> 34:05.399
in the Ultimate
Frogger Championship

34:05.474 --> 34:09.032
and the chance to take home
a cool $100,000.

34:09.107 --> 34:10.225
- Whoo!
- Hoo!

34:11.427 --> 34:16.472
We have Jackie,
who defied gravity in space.

34:16.547 --> 34:18.072
Super Mom Nicole,

34:18.147 --> 34:20.432
who blitzed her way
through Frog City.

34:20.507 --> 34:25.992
But first, into the action,
arcade king Ryan.

34:26.067 --> 34:27.919
- Ready, Frogger?
- Ready!

34:27.994 --> 34:29.272
Here we go!

34:29.347 --> 34:31.439
- All right, let's do it!
- So positive.

34:31.514 --> 34:33.039
Very positive.
Very smiley.

34:33.114 --> 34:37.752
He scored 119,000
on the video game Frogger.

34:37.827 --> 34:40.079
Can he score a 5 on this one?

34:46.547 --> 34:48.192
Here he goes.

34:48.267 --> 34:50.392
You see on the edge
of the Venus flytrap

34:50.467 --> 34:51.879
there is one of our froglets.

34:51.954 --> 34:54.519
The closest to the beach.

34:56.714 --> 34:58.405
Oh, boy. Pull yourself up.

34:58.481 --> 35:00.839
- Pulled himself up. Nice jump.
- This is Ryan Zlatniski.

35:00.914 --> 35:02.632
Of course you know him
if you are a fan

35:02.707 --> 35:03.879
of the video game Frogger.

35:03.954 --> 35:05.759
He's sort of a legend
in those circles.

35:05.834 --> 35:08.672
Trying to become one here.
Steps onto a tongue.

35:08.747 --> 35:10.159
Uh! You're going in.

35:11.234 --> 35:13.472
Ryan, a deliberate pace here,
not frantic.

35:13.547 --> 35:15.952
That can serve you well.
Giving the thing a kiss,

35:16.027 --> 35:17.232
and he tossed it away.

35:17.307 --> 35:19.399
He's gonna make the jump
without it.

35:23.347 --> 35:26.079
Big jump, here we go!

35:27.521 --> 35:28.872
- Oh!
- Oh!

35:28.947 --> 35:31.832
Aw, Ryan goes down.

35:31.907 --> 35:36.272
That dastardly Boss Toad
claims another Frogger's life.

35:36.347 --> 35:38.832
Now folks, that froglet
does not count

35:38.907 --> 35:40.392
'cause he did not put it
in the bassinet.

35:40.467 --> 35:43.592
Ryan's score is
unfortunately zero.

35:43.667 --> 35:45.472
If you're one of
these Froggers watching,

35:45.547 --> 35:47.159
if you're Nicole,
if you're Jackie,

35:47.234 --> 35:49.199
what did you learn
from watching Ryan?

35:49.274 --> 35:52.112
- Absolutely nothing.
- Diddley.

35:52.187 --> 35:53.039
That would be their answer.

35:53.114 --> 35:55.319
Diddley squizz-at.

35:56.347 --> 35:58.312
All right, next up
in the supreme battle

35:58.387 --> 36:00.312
against Boss Toad's temple

36:00.387 --> 36:02.592
- Super Mom Nicole.
- Here we go.

36:02.667 --> 36:03.992
- Kyle, I love Nicole.
- Oh, yeah.

36:04.067 --> 36:05.512
All right?
She is a legit Super Mom,

36:05.587 --> 36:08.032
and is back to fight
another day.

36:08.107 --> 36:10.512
- Ready, let's do it!
- Here we go!

36:10.587 --> 36:12.432
- She's excited.
- Very excited.

36:12.507 --> 36:14.879
This is New Hampshire's
Nicole Fagundez.

36:14.954 --> 36:17.592
"Live free or die!"

36:17.667 --> 36:19.519
One frog, and live.

36:22.147 --> 36:23.072
Here we go.

36:23.081 --> 36:24.552
Nicole, meet Harriet.

36:24.627 --> 36:26.272
She's on top of the hippo,
off to a good start,

36:26.281 --> 36:28.512
going a different direction
than Ryan Zlatniski.

36:28.587 --> 36:30.872
Probably a good idea.
Onto the lily.

36:30.947 --> 36:32.912
Does she go
Chopper or Toad Temple?

36:32.987 --> 36:35.592
Wayans, let's find out.

36:35.667 --> 36:37.152
She's going Chopper again!

36:37.227 --> 36:38.952
Toad Temple's intimidating.

36:39.027 --> 36:40.832
Now up the wall,
onto the helipad.

36:40.907 --> 36:42.272
- Doing well.
- Look at the speed.

36:42.281 --> 36:43.712
She's not just chilling, man.

36:43.787 --> 36:45.079
- Mm-mm.
- She's going for it.

36:47.474 --> 36:48.872
Come here,
my little frog baby.

36:48.947 --> 36:51.512
And welcome to
the Hopper Chopper 1000.

36:51.587 --> 36:52.632
Take off, my friend.

36:52.707 --> 36:54.032
She's definitely done this
before.

36:54.107 --> 36:56.152
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

36:56.227 --> 36:58.912
Watch the dismount, Wayans!
This is everything!

36:58.987 --> 37:01.192
- Wow! Good job!
- Nice!

37:01.267 --> 37:03.832
And she takes the lead.

37:03.907 --> 37:06.072
Nicole Fagundez
is out in front,

37:06.147 --> 37:07.952
Ryan is eliminated,

37:08.027 --> 37:10.392
And now she can add
to that lead quickly.

37:10.467 --> 37:11.992
She's got four minutes left.

37:12.067 --> 37:13.672
- Tons of time.
- Tons of time.

37:13.747 --> 37:16.432
Four minutes, four froglets.
It's symmetry.

37:16.507 --> 37:19.072
And here comes number two
in the teeth

37:19.147 --> 37:20.872
- of that Venus Frogtrap.
- Oh, look at that!

37:20.947 --> 37:23.159
The straddle strategy,
I love it!

37:23.234 --> 37:25.039
Now will she throw it?
Will she shoot it?

37:26.347 --> 37:28.632
She's gonna jump with it.

37:28.707 --> 37:29.825
- [grunts]

37:29.901 --> 37:31.552
Oh, Nicole's down!
It's over!

37:31.627 --> 37:34.839
It's over! She tried to make
the jump with the froglet.

37:34.914 --> 37:36.432
So tough.

37:36.507 --> 37:39.072
Super Mom Nicole has
fallen victim

37:39.147 --> 37:40.919
to that evil Boss Toad.

37:40.994 --> 37:42.672
Now, the final Frogger
to face

37:42.747 --> 37:46.072
the Boss Toad Bonus Round,
Jackie Chang.

37:46.147 --> 37:49.232
The stakes are through
the roof for Jackie Chang.

37:49.307 --> 37:51.879
Analytical thinker
who loves puzzles,

37:51.954 --> 37:54.832
this is a $10,000 puzzle.

37:54.907 --> 37:55.872
Biggest puzzle of her life.

37:55.881 --> 37:58.232
Not 10,000 pieces,
$10,000.

37:58.307 --> 38:00.352
Two froglets wins it.

38:00.427 --> 38:02.479
Or one in under 46 seconds.

38:04.747 --> 38:06.879
There's B.T.,
that royal jerk.

38:09.074 --> 38:11.112
Watching, smirking, leering.

38:11.187 --> 38:12.479
Here we go.

38:19.187 --> 38:21.472
Missed the jump.

38:21.547 --> 38:24.599
The clock has already started
Seven seconds in already.

38:24.674 --> 38:26.992
So she's gonna go low and slow.
Barbecue style.

38:27.067 --> 38:30.279
Here she goes, onto Harriet.

38:31.867 --> 38:33.432
- All right!
- Safe long jump.

38:33.507 --> 38:36.232
Nice play. Let's see
what she does here.

38:36.307 --> 38:38.472
- Oh.
- Again, scenic route.

38:38.547 --> 38:40.712
Slow and steady wins the race,
I guess!

38:40.787 --> 38:43.319
Already she's not gonna come
close to the 46 seconds.

38:43.394 --> 38:45.072
We know that.
She's gonna have to get two,

38:45.147 --> 38:46.152
or she's gonna go home.

38:46.227 --> 38:48.479
One will not do it.

38:50.147 --> 38:51.472
- Lily pad, got it.
- Great. Great jump.

38:51.547 --> 38:53.712
Remember, if she goes
in the water, it's over.

38:53.787 --> 38:55.199
It is over and Nicole wins.

38:56.427 --> 38:57.672
She's going right
to the helipad.

38:57.747 --> 38:58.912
They love the helipad, Wayans.

38:58.987 --> 39:00.072
People like to fly, man.

39:00.147 --> 39:01.239
They love to fly.

39:01.314 --> 39:03.119
I'm digging the hairstyle
right now.

39:03.194 --> 39:05.152
Digging all the style,
including

39:05.227 --> 39:07.192
the classic leg pinch
on the froglet.

39:07.267 --> 39:11.272
Now don't let go
of that Hopper Chopper 1000.

39:11.347 --> 39:13.119
- Oh, no!
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

39:14.787 --> 39:16.592
Oh, that was so close.

39:16.667 --> 39:18.992
Okay, dismount.
Give me the dismount.

39:19.001 --> 39:20.832
She's gonna need it properly.
She's got it.

39:20.907 --> 39:23.032
Okay! Wow!
That was a great landing.

39:23.041 --> 39:24.712
Got one froglet down.

39:24.787 --> 39:26.072
Another for the win.

39:26.147 --> 39:28.959
Whoo! One now.

39:31.354 --> 39:33.512
Now there is the winning
froglet, right in front of her,

39:33.587 --> 39:35.079
in the mouth
of the Venus Frogtrap.

39:35.154 --> 39:36.439
Right there in the teeth.

39:37.307 --> 39:39.879
It's gonna come down to
a $10,000 jump, Wayans.

39:41.267 --> 39:42.879
She's made it.
She's alive.

39:44.027 --> 39:45.272
Venus flytrap mouth,

39:45.347 --> 39:47.712
and that is a $10,000 froglet.

39:47.787 --> 39:49.872
- Whoo!
- Look out!

39:49.881 --> 39:51.192
That thing wants to eat her.

39:51.267 --> 39:53.512
And will she get
to Gilligreen's Island?

39:53.587 --> 39:55.279
Here's the biggest jump
of her life, Wayans.

39:56.681 --> 39:58.359
- Absolutely beautiful.
- Smart move.

39:58.434 --> 40:00.272
Almost trying to bowl it
in there.

40:00.347 --> 40:02.272
And now this is everything,
folks.

40:02.347 --> 40:04.672
This is why you tune in.
This is why we do "Frogger."

40:04.747 --> 40:06.872
She's jumped it one way.
Can she do it the other?

40:06.947 --> 40:08.352
Here we go!
It's elevated.

40:08.427 --> 40:11.032
It's difficult.
Jackie Chang, one jump

40:11.107 --> 40:12.792
for the win.

40:12.867 --> 40:14.632
If she splashes, she's done.

40:14.707 --> 40:16.592
If she sticks it, she wins.

40:16.667 --> 40:20.352
This jump has already claimed
Ryan and Nicole.

40:20.427 --> 40:22.432
Oh, my goodness.

40:22.507 --> 40:25.152
Jackie Chang...

40:25.227 --> 40:26.625
- Gotta pull. Fight. Fight.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

40:26.701 --> 40:28.072
- Fight, fight, fight.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

40:28.147 --> 40:29.312
Up up up up.
We gotta get this guy up.

40:29.387 --> 40:32.192
- Come on! Jackie!
- Come on!

40:32.267 --> 40:34.552
Come on, Jackie!
Don't you--don't you--

40:34.627 --> 40:36.032
Oh, she's maneuvering.
She's trying to get

40:36.107 --> 40:37.439
to the seam
in Gilligreen's Island.

40:37.514 --> 40:39.472
She could use the leverage.
Yes, she's got it.

40:39.547 --> 40:41.872
Oh, she's spreading the cheeks
of Gilligreen's Island.

40:41.881 --> 40:43.432
- She really is.
- Oh, my God.

40:43.507 --> 40:45.032
This is a full examination.
She's got the foot up,

40:45.107 --> 40:46.472
That's not gonna do it.
Oh, this is brutal.

40:46.547 --> 40:48.272
- Wow.
- This is high-stakes Frogger.

40:48.347 --> 40:51.872
Wayans, this is the biggest
moment of her Frogger life.

40:51.947 --> 40:54.232
If the clock expires,
she loses

40:54.307 --> 40:56.872
because she banked the froglet
slower than Nicole did.

40:56.947 --> 41:00.672
$10,000 are on the line.

41:00.747 --> 41:03.672
She's got 90 seconds
to make this happen.

41:03.747 --> 41:06.152
If there was ever a gear
you could reach, Jackie,

41:06.227 --> 41:07.752
now's the time.

41:07.827 --> 41:10.392
Problem is, the longer
she waits, the harder it gets.

41:10.467 --> 41:12.352
The energy's sapped out
of those muscles

41:12.361 --> 41:14.392
and everything's
weighing her down.

41:14.467 --> 41:16.672
- Find another gear.
- Oh no.

41:16.747 --> 41:18.839
Upper body strength!

41:18.914 --> 41:20.992
High-stakes Frogger,
right here.

41:21.067 --> 41:22.432
Oh.

41:22.507 --> 41:23.512
Where is she?

41:23.587 --> 41:24.592
[splash]

41:24.601 --> 41:26.392
And it is over.

41:26.401 --> 41:28.272
Jackie went down
like a champ,

41:28.347 --> 41:30.232
but the real champ
is Nicole.

41:30.241 --> 41:33.359
- Wow!
- Who wins with one froglet

41:33.434 --> 41:35.439
in the most improbable of ways.

41:35.514 --> 41:38.272
Great start,
landed on Harriet Hippo

41:38.347 --> 41:41.072
- like she knew her.
- Took a nice photo-op.

41:41.147 --> 41:43.152
Watch this dismount, man.
Mom Ninja.

41:43.227 --> 41:44.352
- Look at that.
- Stuck it.

41:44.427 --> 41:46.072
Not all heroes wear capes.

41:46.081 --> 41:47.639
Some wear fanny packs.

41:47.714 --> 41:52.079
And Super Mom Nicole has
just become tonight's top frog.

41:52.154 --> 41:55.639
She has earned herself...

41:55.714 --> 41:57.192
...and a place for Super Mom

41:57.267 --> 41:59.639
in the Ultimate Frogger
Championship.

42:00.594 --> 42:02.112
Next time on "Frogger"...

42:02.187 --> 42:03.472
- No!
- BOTH: Oh!

42:03.481 --> 42:06.672
...six more athletes
enter the arena.

42:06.747 --> 42:08.072
- Aw!
- There'll be thrills...

42:08.147 --> 42:10.912
- Wow!
- Oh, my God!

42:10.987 --> 42:12.072
spills...

42:12.147 --> 42:13.319
Oh, no!

42:13.394 --> 42:14.539
...and gills.

42:14.614 --> 42:16.919
Actually, Wayans,
frogs do not have gills.

42:16.994 --> 42:18.272
You're right!

42:18.347 --> 42:19.672
There'll be thrills...

42:19.747 --> 42:21.159
Oh, I did that, I did that,
I did that!

42:21.234 --> 42:22.999
...spills,
and frogs don't have gills.

42:23.907 --> 42:26.439
It's exciting and educational.
