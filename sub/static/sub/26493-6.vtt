09:05.540 --> 09:08.134
YOUR DAD DOESN'T LIKE ME.
I'M TAKING OFF.

09:08.140 --> 09:10.302
OH, IN YOUR PRIVATE JET?

09:10.310 --> 09:11.971
HEY, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO ACT THAT WAY

09:11.980 --> 09:13.106
TO IMPRESS
MY DAD, OK?

09:13.110 --> 09:14.418
JUST BE YOURSELF.

09:14.420 --> 09:16.070
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY.
THE GAME SUCKED.

09:16.080 --> 09:19.744
TALKING TO YOUR DAD SUCKED.
YOUR BROTHER SUCKS.

09:19.750 --> 09:20.854
I'M GOING HOME.

09:20.860 --> 09:24.353

09:37.070 --> 09:38.299
WELL, IT JUST SEEMS
A LITTLE CONVENIENT.

09:38.310 --> 09:39.732
ONE MINUTE SHE'S
A NO-NAME ARTIST

09:39.740 --> 09:41.071
ON MY DAD'S LABEL,
AND THE NEXT,

09:41.080 --> 09:42.639
SHE'S DATING HIM WITH
AN ALBUM DROPPING.

09:42.640 --> 09:45.007
OLIVIA: HE'S NOT THE TYPE
TO GET PLAYED, LEILA.

09:45.010 --> 09:46.569
YOU KNOW THAT.

09:46.580 --> 09:48.469
I JUST HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:51.850 --> 09:53.955
MAN: SKR, SKR

10:07.300 --> 10:08.597
AND IF THERE'S EVER
A PROBLEM, I CAN...

10:08.600 --> 10:10.932
THAT'S LOYALTY,
THAT'S LOYALTY

10:10.940 --> 10:12.203
I'M TALKING LOYALTY

10:12.210 --> 10:13.609
THAT'S LOYALTY, LOYALTY

10:13.610 --> 10:16.272

10:16.280 --> 10:17.941
LOYALTY, I'M TALKING

10:17.950 --> 10:19.349

YOU, ALL RIGHT?

10:23.280 --> 10:24.918
LOOK, I'M SORRY, MAN.

10:24.920 --> 10:26.649

10:26.650 --> 10:27.685
RIGHT.

10:27.690 --> 10:29.055
BUT, YO, I HEARD YOU
ALMOST TOOK ONE BACK.

10:29.060 --> 10:30.824
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN THAT.

10:30.830 --> 10:32.628

10:47.080 --> 10:48.400

10:48.410 --> 10:49.832

10:49.840 --> 10:51.444
AIN'T THE WAY
THAT WORKS NO MORE.

10:51.450 --> 10:53.077
SPENCE, IT'LL BE REAL QUICK.

10:53.080 --> 10:54.309

10:55.450 --> 10:57.088
WE'LL SEE YOU ALL

10:57.090 --> 10:58.512
SPENCER: SO THAT'S
HOW IT IS.

10:58.520 --> 11:00.784
SHAWN SNAPS HIS FINGERS,
AND COOP GOES ROLLING?

11:00.790 --> 11:02.258
PRETTY MUCH.

11:02.260 --> 11:03.853
WHAT THEY BEEN DOING?

11:03.860 --> 11:06.454
I DON'T KNOW. SHE DON'T SAY.

11:06.460 --> 11:10.226
BUT COOP'S TOO SMART TO BE
WASTING HER TIME WITH SHAWN.

11:10.230 --> 11:13.165
GOT TO FIND A WAY TO GET
HER OUT FROM UNDER HIM.

11:15.840 --> 11:18.104
COME ON. LET ME

13:58.600 --> 14:00.694
HE WON'T STOP BITCHING.
"PASS TO ME." "DON'T PASS TO ME."

14:00.700 --> 14:02.338
ASHER: I SHOULD'VE BROKEN A
RECEIVING RECORD LAST YEAR.

14:02.340 --> 14:03.637

FROM PRACTICE TOGETHER

14:08.640 --> 14:10.176
TILL WE
COULD WORK IT OUT.

14:10.180 --> 14:11.648
BUT TIMES HAVE
CHANGED.

14:11.650 --> 14:14.574
SO I'M GONNA TAKE
YOU BOYS

14:14.580 --> 14:17.811
ON A LITTLE FIELD TRIP
INSTEAD. COME ON.

14:29.700 --> 14:31.190
SPENCER, HEY,
THANKS FOR COMING.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.759

14:32.770 --> 14:34.738
NOTHING I LIKE MORE THAN
COMING INTO WORK ON MY DAY OFF.

14:34.740 --> 14:36.469
SORRY. MY DAD NEEDS TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING,

14:36.470 --> 14:39.269
BUT I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
BEFORE HE GETS HERE.

14:43.210 --> 14:44.609
THAT'S KIND OF FAST, LEILA.

14:44.610 --> 14:46.203

HOLDING HANDS YET.

14:46.210 --> 14:47.746
SHUT UP.
THIS IS SERIOUS.

14:47.750 --> 14:50.720
I THINK MY DAD WANTS
TO PROPOSE TO CHINA.

14:50.720 --> 14:52.381
AND YOU'RE NOT HAPPY
ABOUT THAT.

14:52.390 --> 14:54.381
DATING IS ONE THING,
BUT MARRIAGE?

14:54.390 --> 14:57.360
COME ON. SHE'S BARELY
OLDER THAN ME.

14:57.360 --> 14:59.283
I JUST DON'T WANT
ANYONE

14:59.290 --> 15:01.224
TAKING ADVANTAGE
OF MY DAD.

15:01.230 --> 15:03.767
SO I WAS THINKING
MAYBE YOU

15:03.770 --> 15:07.297
COULD DO THAT
THING AND FIND OUT.

15:07.300 --> 15:08.290
WHAT THING?

15:08.300 --> 15:09.597
READ HER.

15:09.600 --> 15:13.104
THAT'S NOT
A SUPERPOWER, LEILA.

15:13.110 --> 15:14.373
LOOK, PLEASE.
I NEED YOUR HELP.

15:14.380 --> 15:16.235
I JUST--I DON'T WANT
MY DAD

15:16.240 --> 15:18.345
TO MAKE
A HUGE MISTAKE.

15:19.880 --> 15:21.575
OK.

15:22.780 --> 15:25.181
SO HOW LONG YOU BEEN
CUTTING HAIR?

15:25.190 --> 15:26.942
LONG ENOUGH, MAN.

15:26.950 --> 15:29.715
EVERYBODY GOT A SIDE
HUSTLE IN THE HOOD.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.189
MAN: YOU KNOW, THAT'S
A HARD SPOT TO COP.

15:32.190 --> 15:34.192
WHERE'D YOU GET THE HOOK UP?

15:34.200 --> 15:37.022
WHERE YOU THINK?

15:48.510 --> 15:50.171
YOU KNOW, I HEARD
YOU AND YOUR BOYS

15:50.180 --> 15:52.444
WAS HANGING AROUND
THE SHOP AGAIN.

15:52.450 --> 15:54.145
YOU MUST'VE FORGOT
THAT, UH,

15:54.150 --> 15:55.447
THIS SPOT'S NEUTRAL.

15:55.450 --> 15:57.282
NEXT TIME YOU GOT TO GET
THEM NAPS TRIMMED,

15:57.290 --> 15:58.689
YOU DO IT SOMEWHERE ELSE.

15:58.690 --> 16:00.283
THE NEXT TIME I ROLL
THROUGH HERE,

16:00.290 --> 16:01.985
YOU, HER,

16:01.990 --> 16:04.288
AND WHATEVER BUSINESS
YOU GOT UP IN HERE

16:04.290 --> 16:06.520
BEST BE GONE.

16:06.530 --> 16:10.160
TRY ME AND SEE.

16:10.160 --> 16:11.798
LET'S ROLL, JUICE.

16:19.540 --> 16:21.338
M-MAYBE YOU NEED TO
MOVE THAT DROP.

16:21.340 --> 16:22.899
BONEZ DON'T KNOW NOTHING.

16:22.910 --> 16:24.708
AND EVEN IF HE DID,
AIN'T NOBODY TELL ME

16:24.710 --> 16:27.418
HOW TO HANDLE MY BUSINESS.

16:29.550 --> 16:32.542
I SWEAR, KENDRICK WALKED
OUT THE STUDIO

16:32.550 --> 16:35.190
AND TELLS J.P.
"I'M THE REAL DEAL."

16:35.190 --> 16:36.385
SPENCER: WOW.

16:36.390 --> 16:37.858
BET DAY OF MY LIFE.

16:37.860 --> 16:42.252
WELL, SECOND BEST DAY
AFTER MEETING MY BABY.

16:43.600 --> 16:46.399
SO THAT MUST'VE BEEN
SOME TRACK KENDRICK HEARD.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.129
WHAT WAS IT CALLED AGAIN?

16:48.140 --> 16:49.232
"SHOE GAME."

16:49.240 --> 16:52.107
YOU SHOULD HEAR IT
SOON, HOPEFULLY.

16:52.110 --> 16:53.259
WHY "HOPEFULLY"?

16:53.270 --> 16:54.669
WELL, TECHNICALLY WE
DON'T HAVE A VENUE

16:54.680 --> 16:57.172
FOR HER RELEASE PARTY
JUST YET.

16:57.180 --> 17:00.275
THAT'S WHERE
YOU COME IN, SPENCE.

17:00.280 --> 17:01.941
ME?

17:01.950 --> 17:03.748

17:03.750 --> 17:05.582
SEE, CHINA, SHE COULD
PERFORM LIVE

17:05.589 --> 17:07.354
FOR HER HOME CROWD,

17:07.359 --> 17:08.885
AND WE CAN PROVIDE
EXTRA FOOD,

17:08.890 --> 17:11.279
ACTIVITIES FOR THE KIDS,
T-SHIRTS.

17:11.290 --> 17:13.019
SO YOU WANT TO TURN
A KIDS' BLOCK PARTY

17:13.030 --> 17:14.759
INTO CHINA'S RELEASE PARTY.

17:14.760 --> 17:16.592
CHINA: MORE LIKE COMBINE
THE TWO EVENTS.

17:16.599 --> 17:18.068
BENEFIT THE KIDS.

17:18.069 --> 17:20.128
YEAH. IT'S A WIN-WIN FOR
EVERYONE, BABY.

17:20.130 --> 17:22.440
SO YOU THINK YOU COULD
PUT IN

17:22.440 --> 17:24.431

17:41.560 --> 17:42.880

17:42.890 --> 17:44.654
PATIENCE: YEAH. I MEAN,
HE'S NOT WRONG.

17:44.660 --> 17:47.129
YOU GOT A GIFT, A GIFT
THAT NEEDS TO BE SHARED

17:47.130 --> 17:48.894
WITH EVERYONE, NOT JUST ME.

17:48.900 --> 17:50.129
SPENCER: RIGHT?

17:50.130 --> 17:52.269
COOP: UH, LOOK, YOU TWO
AIN'T GOT TO SMOOTH TALK ME,

17:52.270 --> 17:53.260
ALL RIGHT?

17:53.270 --> 17:54.499
I'M IN.

17:54.500 --> 17:56.935
HEY, WHAT YOU THINK, ALVIN?

17:56.940 --> 17:58.567
I THINK THE KIDS ARE
GONNA LOVE IT.

17:58.570 --> 18:00.800
BOOM! HA HA!

18:00.810 --> 18:03.905
KID: YOU GOT TO COME SEE THIS!

18:17.430 --> 18:19.580
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

18:19.590 --> 18:22.059
EVERYBODY KNOWS THIS IS
A SAFE SPACE.

18:22.060 --> 18:24.893
WE AIN'T GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH GANGS.

18:24.900 --> 18:28.689
NOW, WHY WOULD THEY WANT
TO HIT UP MY SHOP?

18:42.580 --> 18:44.685
YO, MAN, YOU HEARD

18:44.690 --> 18:46.317
LOWER YOUR VOICE.

18:46.320 --> 18:47.458
YO, YOU NEED TO MOVE

18:47.460 --> 18:48.859
THE MONEY STAYS
WHERE IT IS.

18:48.860 --> 18:50.453
MAN. THE HELL IT DOES, MAN.

18:50.460 --> 18:52.588
I SAID, LOWER YOUR

19:09.540 --> 19:11.008
WHY WOULD YOU?

19:11.010 --> 19:12.546
SHE AIN'T YOURS.

19:12.550 --> 19:15.019
HER MAMA LEFT
A WHILE BACK.

19:15.020 --> 19:17.546
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT
GETTING HER OUT OF THIS LIFE?

19:17.550 --> 19:19.814
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I'M TRYING TO DO?

19:19.820 --> 19:21.413
THAT MONEY'S
FOR HER.

19:21.420 --> 19:22.819
SHE'S THE REASON

19:22.820 --> 19:24.424
I GOT TO KEEP IT
AT ALVIN'S.

19:24.430 --> 19:26.228
IT'S NEUTRAL, COOP.

19:26.230 --> 19:28.858
ANYWHERE ELSE, AND MY HUSTLE
BECOMES EVERYBODY'S HUSTLE.

19:28.860 --> 19:31.363
I THINK IT'S TIME YOU
FIND A NEW HUSTLE.

19:31.370 --> 19:33.498
LIKE WHAT, MAN?

19:33.500 --> 19:35.138

19:44.210 --> 19:46.907
YOU JUST BEEN WORKING
WITH THE WRONG PEOPLE.

19:46.910 --> 19:49.516
THERE GOT TO BE SOMETHING
ELSE OUT HERE YOU COULD DO.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.215
YOU PLAYING YOURSELF

19:51.220 --> 19:53.985

SAME SHOTS OTHER PEOPLE DO

19:53.990 --> 19:57.756
BECAUSE IF WE DID,
I'D BE OUT.

19:57.760 --> 20:00.923
MAYA: SHE WONDERS
WHY ALL THIS IS GONE.

20:00.930 --> 20:03.353
HEY, LEAVE THAT

HEY, COME HERE.

20:11.910 --> 20:13.935

20:16.280 --> 20:18.374

20:18.380 --> 20:20.644
I WAS READY FOR WHATEVER,
I WAS BORN LIKE THIS

20:20.650 --> 20:22.072
I WAS BORN LIKE THIS

20:22.080 --> 20:24.082

20:25.720 --> 20:27.484
YOU GET SO ANGRY

20:27.490 --> 20:28.560
WHY?

20:28.560 --> 20:29.550
WHY YOU ALWAYS SO MAD?

20:43.300 --> 20:45.860
THAT'S LOOKING GOOD.
DOUBLE TIME, DOUBLE TIME.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.474
WHY AREN'T YOU OUT
THERE PRACTICING

20:47.480 --> 20:48.629
WITH THE REST OF YOUR SQUAD?

20:48.640 --> 20:51.644
IT'S THE SAME 5 ROUTINES
EVERY GAME.

20:51.650 --> 20:53.607
I CAN DO THIS IN
MY SLEEP.

20:53.610 --> 20:56.716
NOW, THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.588
YOU WANT TO WATCH
ME SLEEP?

20:59.590 --> 21:01.684
CAN THAT BE ARRANGED?

21:03.090 --> 21:04.785
THAT DEPENDS.

21:04.790 --> 21:07.851
DEPENDS ON WHAT?

21:09.200 --> 21:11.123
YOU ASKING ME ON A DATE?

21:13.530 --> 21:15.635

21:27.820 --> 21:29.470
THEIR BEST
DEFENSIVE END.

21:29.480 --> 21:30.641
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

21:30.650 --> 21:32.140
BECAUSE WHEN MY MOM
MOVED TO MALIBU,

21:32.150 --> 21:34.016
I CAME AND LOOKED AT
A FEW SCHOOLS HERE.

21:34.020 --> 21:35.658
I DECIDED TO STAY

21:35.660 --> 21:36.786
HMM, LUCKY US.

21:36.790 --> 21:37.860

GETTING ANY BAD VIBES

22:35.150 --> 22:36.220
FROM CHINA?

22:36.220 --> 22:37.779
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE
TRYING REAL HARD

22:37.790 --> 22:39.019
TO FIND SOMETHING
WRONG WITH HER,

22:39.020 --> 22:40.283
BUT I'D GIVE HER
A CHANCE.

22:40.290 --> 22:42.349
I MEAN, YOUR DAD
SEEMS TO LIKE HER.

22:42.360 --> 22:45.182
WELL, PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME
THINKING STRAIGHT WHEN THEY'RE GRIEVING.

22:45.190 --> 22:47.022
AREN'T YOU STILL
GRIEVING?

22:47.030 --> 22:49.226

23:48.360 --> 23:50.749
SHE WANTED HER BOY BY
HER SIDE, THAT'S ALL.

23:50.760 --> 23:51.989
WHY IS THAT?

23:51.990 --> 23:53.754

THE BOTH OF US.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.759
NAH. NO WAY.

LOOK, YOU GOT TO GO, BRO.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.399

AH, KEEP IT. WE ONLY NEED

26:41.030 --> 26:42.520
THOUGH WHEN I WAS
COACHING BEVERLY,

26:42.530 --> 26:44.225
I NEVER FELT THE NEED
TO ADOPT A KID

26:44.230 --> 26:46.164
JUST TO MAKE MY TEAM
BETTER.

26:46.170 --> 26:48.935
BUT, LIKE YOU SAID,
A WIN'S A WIN.

26:48.940 --> 26:50.863
TOUCHE.

IF WE'RE GONNA BEAT THEM.

26:58.080 --> 26:59.741
SERIOUSLY?

26:59.750 --> 27:02.776
DUDE, THIS PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE
CRAP IS GETTING OLD.

27:02.780 --> 27:05.044
IT'S BETTER THAN THE
ALTERNATIVE, OK, TRUST ME?

27:05.050 --> 27:06.882
WELL, WHAT THE HELL

OH, FINE. I'M DONE TRYING.

27:13.930 --> 27:16.991
HEY, DON'T PASS TO ME,

27:26.470 --> 27:27.904
HOW COULD YOU TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF HER?

27:27.910 --> 27:30.072
-LOOK, IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.
WHAT WAS IT LIKE?

27:30.080 --> 27:32.276

27:32.280 --> 27:33.839
ARE YOU KIDDING ME, DUDE?

27:33.850 --> 27:35.215
HOW DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GONNA WIN

27:35.220 --> 27:38.349
WHEN YOU CAN'T EVEN
CONTROL YOUR PLAYERS?

27:42.060 --> 27:43.710
HEY. HEY.

27:43.720 --> 27:45.085
HEY!

27:45.090 --> 27:47.149
GET UP OFF THE GROUND.

27:48.160 --> 27:49.628
MAN: BEEP-BEEP, BACK IT UP

27:49.630 --> 27:53.089
LAY IT DOWN LIKE
A CEMENT TRUCK

27:53.100 --> 27:54.590
SHUT UP. YOU DID GOOD.

27:54.600 --> 27:55.965
<i>-THANK YOU.
-HA HAL</i>

27:55.970 --> 27:58.359
HEY, YOU GOT THE
WHOLE PLACE ROCKING.

27:58.370 --> 28:00.930
OK. I AIN'T DO NOTHING
BUT STAND UP AND YELL.

28:00.940 --> 28:04.137
YEAH. YOU'RE PRETTY
GOOD AT THAT.

28:04.140 --> 28:05.278
CHECK IT.

28:05.280 --> 28:06.975
I GOT THE BIG DOG'S
CARD.

28:06.980 --> 28:09.039
HE SAID HE MIGHT
HAVE A JOB FOR ME.

28:09.050 --> 28:12.714
BOOM! THAT'S SICK. OH, MAN.

28:12.720 --> 28:14.814
MAYBE YOU RIGHT, COOP.

28:14.820 --> 28:15.912
ABOUT WHAT?

28:15.920 --> 28:17.456
GETTING THE MONEY
OUT OF ALVIN'S.

28:17.460 --> 28:19.087
IT NEVER SHOULD'VE
BEEN THERE ANYWAY.

28:19.090 --> 28:21.127
YEAH, YOU KNOW I'll
GO WITH YOU.

28:21.130 --> 28:23.349
NAH. IT'S JUST AROUND
THE BLOCK.

28:23.360 --> 28:26.421
YOU STAY HERE, KEEP
THIS PARTY ALIVE, HUH?

28:26.430 --> 28:27.568
HUH?

28:35.910 --> 28:37.332
LEILA:
MUST BE FUN COMING BACK

28:37.340 --> 28:38.876
TO YOUR OLD NEIGHBORHOOD
LIKE THIS.

28:38.880 --> 28:40.405
IT'S SPECIAL.

28:40.410 --> 28:43.072
WHERE ARE YOU FROM, REALLY?

28:44.590 --> 28:46.285
CRENSHAW.,

28:47.290 --> 28:48.883
I MOVED WHEN I WAS
LITTLE. SO WHAT?

28:48.890 --> 28:51.086
SO YOU'RE USING YOUR
COMMUNITY TO SELL RECORDS

28:51.090 --> 28:52.683
AND YOU'RE USING MY DAD.

28:52.690 --> 28:54.556
NOBODY'S USING ANYBODY.

28:54.560 --> 28:56.892
I DON'T NEED ANYBODY'S
HELP, SIS.

28:56.900 --> 28:58.766
AND THE WHOLE CRENSHAW
ANGLE,

28:58.770 --> 29:01.296
THAT'S YOUR DAD'S IDEA.

29:01.300 --> 29:03.689
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

29:03.700 --> 29:07.238
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
ASK HIM YOURSELF?

29:12.010 --> 29:15.719
COOP: OH! GO PUT YOUR
HANDS UP, UP IN THE SKY

29:15.720 --> 29:18.087
PUT YOUR HANDS UP,
UP IN THE SKY

29:18.090 --> 29:20.650
SAY, "GO, CHINA!
GO, CHINA! GO!"

29:20.650 --> 29:22.414
AUDIENCE: GO, CHINA!
GO, CHINA! GO!

29:22.420 --> 29:26.186
COOP: SAY, "GO, CHINA!
GO, CHINA! GO

29:26.190 --> 29:27.851
CHINA: COMING
STRAIGHT OUT OF CRENSHAW

29:27.860 --> 29:29.954
CRAZY LITTLE CHICK
NAMED CHINA...

29:29.960 --> 29:32.327
[SONG CONTINUES,
INDISTINCT]

29:36.500 --> 29:39.208
BUT CROSS ME, AND MY
HATERS COME AND FIND YOU

29:39.210 --> 29:41.099
NO PRACTICE,
WE GET ACCESS

29:41.110 --> 29:43.033
NO RESPITE,
DEAL WITH IT...

29:43.040 --> 29:45.873
SORRY, FELLAS.
THE SHOP'S CLOSED.

29:45.880 --> 29:47.609
WE AIN'T HERE
FOR NO HAIRCUT,

29:47.610 --> 29:50.671
BUT WE DEFINITELY
GONNA TAKE A CUT.

29:50.680 --> 29:53.217
WHEN I WAS COMING UP,
I AIN'T HAVE MUCH

29:53.220 --> 29:55.609
SO I LIKE TO LIVE IT
UP, NOT AVERAGE

29:55.620 --> 29:57.759
I LIKE TRIPS TO SPAIN,
DUBAI, PARIS...

29:57.760 --> 29:59.819
SHAWN: JUST WALK AWAY
AND LET ME TAKE WHAT'S MINE.

29:59.830 --> 30:03.130
THE PROBLEM IS,
WHAT'S YOURS IS OURS NOW.

30:15.180 --> 30:16.238
MAN: COMING STRAIGHT OUT
OF CRENSHAW.

30:24.450 --> 30:26.316
COOP!

30:49.080 --> 30:50.104
HEY, COOP, COOP!

30:50.110 --> 30:51.271
WHERE YOU GOING?

30:51.280 --> 30:52.805
I'M GOING TO LOOK FOR
SHAWN, MAN.

30:52.810 --> 30:54.812
HE COULD BE HURT, ANYTHING.
I GOT TO KNOW HE COOL.

30:54.820 --> 30:57.278
HE AIN'T COOL. THAT'S A DEAD
BODY OVER THERE AT ALVIN'S SHOP.

30:57.280 --> 30:59.214
LOOK, SHAWN WAS TRYING
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

30:59.220 --> 31:01.018
BOTH OF HIS BOYS IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.

31:01.020 --> 31:03.250
LOOK, SHAWN SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
MESSING WITH ALVIN'S IN THE FIRST PLACE.

31:03.260 --> 31:04.557
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

31:04.560 --> 31:05.857
WHAT AM I GONNA DO,
SPENCER?

31:05.860 --> 31:07.225
YOU DON'T HAVE NO
IDEA

31:07.230 --> 31:08.823
WHAT'S GOING DOWN
IN THE HOOD RIGHT NOW.

31:08.830 --> 31:10.719
YOU TOLD ME TO GO
TO BEVERLY, ALL RIGHT?

31:10.730 --> 31:12.664
THAT'S WHAT I DO. I LOOK
OUT FOR MY PEOPLE.

31:12.670 --> 31:14.365
AND DESPITE WHAT
YOU THINK OF SHAWN...

31:14.370 --> 31:16.031
-COOP.
-BELIEVE IN HIM...

31:16.040 --> 31:17.337
THE SAME WAY 1
BELIEVE IN YOU.

31:17.340 --> 31:20.970
HE'S A THUG, ALL RIGHT?
HE'S A THUG.

31:20.970 --> 31:22.836
WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE FOR
YOU TO FINALLY LET HIM GO?

31:22.840 --> 31:24.979
WHAT? YOU WANT TO BE UNDER
ONE OF THOSE SHEETS?

31:24.980 --> 31:27.176
'CAUSE WHATEVER'S COMING FOR
HIM IS COMING FOR YOU, TOO, ALL RIGHT?

31:27.180 --> 31:29.774
AND IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE THEY SHOW UP AT MY HOUSE,

31:29.780 --> 31:33.387
PUTTING MY FAMILY IN DANGER,
AND THAT CAN'T HAPPEN.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.554
I KNOW.

31:38.190 --> 31:40.249
I'll BE GONE TONIGHT.

31:40.260 --> 31:42.194
SO WHAT,
SO THAT'S IT?

31:42.200 --> 31:43.497
YOU'RE GONNA CHOOSE
HIM OVER ME?

31:43.500 --> 31:44.968
OVER MY MOMS?
OVER DYLAN?

31:44.970 --> 31:48.133
SPENCER, YOU GOOD NOW.
YOU DON'T NEED ME ANYMORE.

31:48.140 --> 31:49.335
BUT SHAWN DOES,

31:49.340 --> 31:51.263
AND I'M NOT GONNA TURN
MY BACK ON HIM.

31:51.270 --> 31:53.568
I NEVER DID ON YOU.

31:58.810 --> 32:00.869
YOU REALLY THINK HE'S
GONNA MAKE US WALK

32:00.880 --> 32:02.018
ALL THE WAY BACK?

32:02.020 --> 32:04.443
IT'S LIKE 10 MILES,
DUDE.

32:06.350 --> 32:08.159
WILL YOU LET ME EXPLAIN?

32:08.160 --> 32:09.582
WAS SHE SOBER?

32:12.860 --> 32:14.453
EXACTLY. AND YOU KNEW SHE WAS
GOING THROUGH A HARD TIME.

32:14.460 --> 32:15.894
WE BOTH WERE.

32:15.900 --> 32:17.891
RIGHT. STAR WIDE RECEIVER,
LIVING IN A MANSION,

32:17.900 --> 32:19.789
DATING THE MOST POPULAR
GIRL IN SCHOOL.

32:19.800 --> 32:20.722
SOUNDS ROUGH.

32:20.730 --> 32:23.267
I'M NOT LIVING IN
A MANSION.

32:23.270 --> 32:26.262
WE LOST THE HOUSE.

32:27.310 --> 32:29.108
AND WE'RE BROKE.

32:29.110 --> 32:31.374
MY DAD GOT LAID OFF
LAST YEAR,

32:31.380 --> 32:33.303
AND WE LOST
EVERYTHING.

32:33.310 --> 32:36.041
THAT'S WHY MY MOM
LEFT HIM.

32:36.050 --> 32:37.472
THAT'S WHY SHE LEFT US.

32:37.480 --> 32:39.289
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME?

32:39.290 --> 32:40.940
IT'S EMBARRASSING, MAN.

32:42.560 --> 32:45.382
I--I DIDN'T TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF YOUR SISTER.

32:45.390 --> 32:48.621
I WAS DEPRESSED,
AND SHE WAS, TOO,

32:48.630 --> 32:50.621
AND IT JUST HAPPENED.

32:50.630 --> 32:54.260
ONCE. IT WAS A MISTAKE.

32:54.270 --> 32:56.898
AND I-I'M SORRY.

33:00.410 --> 33:01.900
SO YOU JUST THREW THAT
HUGE PARTY

33:01.910 --> 33:03.935
AT SOMEONE ELSE'S HOME?

33:06.680 --> 33:08.318
TWO DJS.

33:11.020 --> 33:13.216
DESTROYED THEIR
CAR, TOO.

33:13.220 --> 33:14.619
OH, MY GOD.

33:14.620 --> 33:16.315
HA HA!

33:25.370 --> 33:27.725
YOU BOYS GOOD NOW?

33:28.970 --> 33:30.961
YEAH. WE'RE GOOD.

33:30.970 --> 33:33.962
ALL RIGHT. THE LONG WALK
HOME WORKS EVERY TIME.

33:33.970 --> 33:37.531
HOP IN. WE GOT A GAME
TO GET READY FOR.

33:40.610 --> 33:42.612
J.P.: GREAT.
THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

33:42.620 --> 33:46.284
LET'S PUT IT ON
THE SCHEDULE. BABE?

33:46.290 --> 33:48.145
THAT WAS A REPORTER
FROM THE "TIMES."

33:48.150 --> 33:51.381
THEY WANT TO DO A PIECE
ABOUT YOUR TIES TO CRENSHAW.

33:51.390 --> 33:53.927
WHAT'D I TELL YOU, HUH?

33:53.930 --> 33:57.389
YOU CAN'T BUY PUBLICITY
LIKE THAT.

34:01.100 --> 34:02.295
DAD?

34:02.300 --> 34:03.893
HEY, BABY.

34:03.900 --> 34:05.208
WHY ARE YOU HAPPY?

34:05.210 --> 34:07.838
SOMEBODY COULD BE HURT,
AND YOU'RE CELEBRATING?

34:07.840 --> 34:09.501
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT,
PRINCESS.

34:09.510 --> 34:10.705
NO, YOU WANTED

34:10.710 --> 34:12.507
AN AUTHENTIC
CRENSHAW EXPERIENCE.

34:12.510 --> 34:14.205
I GUESS
YOU GOT IT, HUH?

34:14.210 --> 34:15.917
YOU TWO DESERVE
EACH OTHER.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.274
HAVE A NICE LIFE.

34:17.280 --> 34:19.487
PRINCESS.

34:26.960 --> 34:29.156
MAN, I AIN'T GOT TIME
TO DEAL WITH YOU TONIGHT.

34:29.159 --> 34:33.063
I AIN'T COME TO FIGHT,
SHAWN. I CAME TO TALK.

34:33.070 --> 34:34.094
SO TALK.

34:34.100 --> 34:37.730
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU GOT GOING ON,

34:37.739 --> 34:40.801
BUT NOW YOU GOT COOP
WRAPPED UP IN IT.

34:40.810 --> 34:43.905
SO IT'S ON YOU TO LOOK
OUT FOR HER NOW.

34:45.580 --> 34:47.571
AND IF YOU DRAG
HER DOWN WITH YOU--

34:47.580 --> 34:49.241
YOU AND ME,

34:49.250 --> 34:53.187
WE'RE GONNA BE HAVING A VERY
DIFFERENT CONVERSATION,

34:53.190 --> 34:54.442
ALL RIGHT?

34:54.449 --> 34:56.054
BELIEVE THAT.

34:56.060 --> 34:59.086
OH, GOD, I HOPE SHE
RIGHT ABOUT YOU.

35:17.940 --> 35:19.203
I'M SORRY YOU HAD
TO DEAL WITH THAT TODAY.

35:19.210 --> 35:20.541
IT'S OK.
I JUST...YEAH.

35:20.550 --> 35:22.541
I'VE--I'VE NEVER BEEN
THAT CLOSE TO GUNFIRE.

35:22.550 --> 35:23.676
LIKE, EVER.

35:23.680 --> 35:25.546
IT WASN'T THAT CLOSE.

35:25.550 --> 35:26.949
OH, YEAH?

35:26.950 --> 35:30.454
THEN WHY DID YOU PUT
YOUR ARMS AROUND ME?

35:30.460 --> 35:35.660
SEE? YOU ARE
BLOWING MY COVER AGAIN.

35:39.570 --> 35:41.197
THIS IS ME.

35:41.200 --> 35:43.237
OK.

35:45.640 --> 35:48.337
I ACTUALLY HAD A GOOD
TIME WITH YOU TODAY.

35:48.340 --> 35:49.705
ME, TOO.

35:49.710 --> 35:56.013
SO YOU GONNA GIVE ME
THEM DIGITS OR WHAT?

35:57.420 --> 36:02.415
UM...I KIND OF SWORE
OFF MEN FOR A WHILE.

36:02.420 --> 36:04.912
I'M TRYING TO FOCUS ON
MYSELF, YOU KNOW?

36:04.920 --> 36:08.595
OK. OK. WELL,
I'll TELL YOU WHAT,

36:08.600 --> 36:12.195
TAKE MY NUMBER DOWN.

36:12.200 --> 36:15.397
AND ONCE YOU FIGURE IT OUT,

36:15.400 --> 36:17.789
YOU LET ME KNOW.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.006
OK.

36:20.410 --> 36:21.605
GOOD NIGHT.

36:21.610 --> 36:24.409
GOOD NIGHT.

36:24.410 --> 36:28.620
HEY. DRIVE SAFE.

36:28.620 --> 36:30.509
I WILL.

36:47.900 --> 36:49.834
HEY.

36:49.840 --> 36:51.137
HEY.

36:51.140 --> 36:52.835
I'M SORRY ABOUT TODAY.

36:52.840 --> 36:54.330
WHY?

36:54.340 --> 36:57.105
CHINA GOT THE STREET CRED
MY DAD WAS LOOKING FOR.

36:57.110 --> 36:59.204
HE COULDN'T HAVE PLANNED
IT BETTER HIMSELF.

36:59.210 --> 37:02.009
YOU DON'T THINK YOU'RE
BEING A LITTLE HARD ON HIM?

37:02.020 --> 37:04.443
HE USED THOSE KIDS
TODAY, SPENCER.

37:04.450 --> 37:07.715
HE USED YOU. HE USED
ME TO GET TO YOU.

37:07.720 --> 37:09.484
IS THAT REALLY WHAT
YOU'RE ANGRY ABOUT?

37:09.490 --> 37:10.912
BECAUSE IF YOU ASK ME,
IT SEEMS LIKE

37:10.920 --> 37:12.888
THERE'S A LOT MORE
GOING ON HERE.

37:12.890 --> 37:14.927
YOU SHOULD TALK TO HIM.

37:14.930 --> 37:16.420
HE'S PROBABLY HALFWAY TO
THE AIRPORT NOW ANYWAY.

37:16.430 --> 37:18.990
LOOK, I AIN'T GET A CHANCE
TO KNOW MY POPS, ALL RIGHT?

37:19.000 --> 37:21.264
AND YOU AIN'T GET IT
WITH YOUR MOMS.

37:21.270 --> 37:23.659
BUT YOU OWE IT TO
YOURSELF TO BE HONEST.

37:23.670 --> 37:25.809
THE TRUTH IS ALL WE GOT...

37:27.110 --> 37:29.636
EVEN WHEN IT HURTS.

37:31.340 --> 37:33.342
HE'S JUST
ALL I HAVE LEFT,

37:33.350 --> 37:36.615
AND I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE HIM,

37:36.620 --> 37:39.681
IF I HAVEN'T
ALREADY.

37:43.060 --> 37:45.722
YOU HAVEN'T.

37:53.430 --> 37:56.036
I'M GLAD
I FOUND YOU HERE.

37:56.040 --> 37:59.260
I DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE
THINGS LIKE THAT.

38:01.310 --> 38:02.709
I WANTED TO SAY
GOOD-BYE.

38:02.710 --> 38:06.704
WELL, THE THING IS YOU
SAID GOOD-BYE WHEN MOM DIED.

38:06.710 --> 38:08.712
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW IT YET.

38:08.720 --> 38:09.949
LEILA, HONEY, I--

38:09.950 --> 38:12.647
SHE WAS TAKEN, BUT...

38:12.650 --> 38:15.187
YOU CHOSE TO GO.

38:19.290 --> 38:21.281
I LOVED YOUR MOM, BUT...

38:25.670 --> 38:27.468
I WAS...

38:27.470 --> 38:29.666
I WAS NEVER GOOD
ENOUGH FOR HER...

38:31.000 --> 38:33.162
OR YOU.

38:33.170 --> 38:36.970
ALWAYS ALL ABOUT ME.

38:38.810 --> 38:41.700
YOUR MOM...

38:42.820 --> 38:45.710
SHE FILLED
EVERY DARK SPOT

38:45.720 --> 38:46.983
WITH LIGHT.

38:46.990 --> 38:49.288
AND NOW THAT SHE'S GONE,

38:49.290 --> 38:51.850
YOU'RE FINALLY SEEING
ME FOR WHAT I AM.

38:51.860 --> 38:54.682
YOU SAW THAT TODAY.

38:58.300 --> 39:00.769
AND I'M SORRY FOR THAT.

39:00.770 --> 39:04.035
YOU AND I BOTH.

39:06.740 --> 39:09.334
THIS WASN'T FOR CHINA.

39:11.850 --> 39:14.478
THIS WAS FOR YOU.

39:14.480 --> 39:16.778
I BOUGHT IT
FOR YOUR MOTHER.

39:18.620 --> 39:21.248
IT WAS AN ANNIVERSARY
UPGRADE.

39:21.250 --> 39:24.754
I NEVER HAD THE CHANCE
TO GIVE IT TO HER.

39:26.330 --> 39:31.029
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT
TO HAVE IT.

39:34.800 --> 39:36.894
LISTEN, I, UM...

39:40.210 --> 39:43.874
I--I KNOW I'M NOT
THE PERSON

39:43.880 --> 39:46.201
THAT YOU THOUGHT
I WAS.

39:47.810 --> 39:50.245
I'M NOT THE FATHER
YOU DESERVE TO HAVE,

39:50.250 --> 39:52.218
BUT I LOVE YOU.
