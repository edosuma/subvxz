07:10.430 --> 07:11.932
with anybody else

07:11.973 --> 07:14.017
we sort of have a date

07:11.973 --> 07:14.017
with each other.

07:14.059 --> 07:15.685
Unbelievable.

07:15.727 --> 07:19.273
Even when he doesn't have

07:15.727 --> 07:19.273
a date, he has a date.

07:19.314 --> 07:21.816
Go on. Get out of here.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.026
Hello, everybody.

07:23.068 --> 07:24.236
Jesse.

07:26.529 --> 07:28.198
Robin, I'd like you to meet

07:26.529 --> 07:28.198
my brother-in-law, Jesse.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.824
Jesse, this is Robin.

07:29.866 --> 07:32.077
She was a news writer

07:29.866 --> 07:32.077
at my first station.

07:33.995 --> 07:36.039
- Hello.

07:33.995 --> 07:36.039
- Hi.

07:36.081 --> 07:38.375
- Hi.

07:38.417 --> 07:40.585
Any day now, they'll

07:38.417 --> 07:40.585
get to "Nice to meet you."

07:42.212 --> 07:43.380
We're going out

07:42.212 --> 07:43.380
tomorrow, right?

07:43.422 --> 07:44.505
Absolutely.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.591
Boy, does he work fast.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.887
We met at the station.

07:50.929 --> 07:53.514
Oh. Jesse, I hope

07:50.929 --> 07:53.514
you don't mind

07:53.556 --> 07:56.017
but I-I invited Robin to

07:53.556 --> 07:56.017
stay here this weekend

07:56.059 --> 07:57.894
and I thought she could

07:56.059 --> 07:57.894
stay in your room.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.109
God bless you.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.526
Of course, that means

08:04.151 --> 08:05.526
you'll be moving in with--

08:05.568 --> 08:07.112
No, no, no, no.

08:05.568 --> 08:07.112
Don't say it.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.863
Please don't say

08:07.154 --> 08:08.863
the "J" word.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.782
Ding ding ding! Come on!

08:10.824 --> 08:13.034
Soup's on! Hey, plenty

08:10.824 --> 08:13.034
of grub for everybody!

08:13.076 --> 08:15.078
Hyah! Keep them

08:13.076 --> 08:15.078
doggies rolling!

08:15.120 --> 08:18.415
Go on, grab a beef hoof,

08:15.120 --> 08:18.415
Danny! Go on, hyah!

08:18.457 --> 08:19.582
Hi, roomie!

08:19.624 --> 08:20.708
Hi, Jesse.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.210
Hi, Jill.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.754
Hi, Jill?

08:22.252 --> 08:24.754
Hi, Jill!

08:24.796 --> 08:26.881
Oh, you didn't forget about

08:24.796 --> 08:26.881
our date tonight, did you?

08:26.923 --> 08:30.051
Uh, no. No, of course not.

08:26.923 --> 08:30.051
We're going right now.

08:30.093 --> 08:31.261
Let's go, let's go

08:30.093 --> 08:31.261
get something to eat.

08:31.303 --> 08:32.929
- Shall we?

08:31.303 --> 08:32.929
- Wait. Don't go.

08:32.971 --> 08:35.723
I spent hours cooking

08:32.971 --> 08:35.723
a delicious Chinese meal.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.643
Yum! I love Chinese!

08:42.356 --> 08:45.317
I better check

08:42.356 --> 08:45.317
on my egg rolls.

08:45.359 --> 08:47.152
You better protect

08:45.359 --> 08:47.152
your egg rolls.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.373
Have a seat, roomie!

09:01.833 --> 09:05.420
So, Robin, this

09:01.833 --> 09:05.420
is my friend Jill.

09:05.462 --> 09:08.048
Jill, this is my

09:05.462 --> 09:08.048
other friend Robin.

09:08.089 --> 09:10.175
Yes, friends

09:08.089 --> 09:10.175
meeting friends

09:10.217 --> 09:11.634
having a nice,

09:10.217 --> 09:11.634
friendly dinner

09:11.676 --> 09:13.970
of friendship, if you will.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.138
Jill and I

09:14.012 --> 09:15.138
have already met

09:15.180 --> 09:16.723
but it's nice to

09:15.180 --> 09:16.723
meet you again.

09:16.764 --> 09:18.016
In fact,

09:16.764 --> 09:18.016
Jill was telling me

09:18.058 --> 09:20.101
that you two have

09:18.058 --> 09:20.101
a date tonight.

09:20.143 --> 09:22.145
Yeah, can you believe

09:20.143 --> 09:22.145
he got off this cheap?

09:22.187 --> 09:26.107
But he's so cute.

09:22.187 --> 09:26.107
How could you not love him?

09:30.695 --> 09:32.239
So, let's see what

09:30.695 --> 09:32.239
Joseph's cooked up

09:32.280 --> 09:34.366
for us tonight, shall we?

09:32.280 --> 09:34.366
Oh, look at this food.

09:34.408 --> 09:35.700
- Joey, it smells great.

09:34.408 --> 09:35.700
- Mmm.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.370
- Mmm.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.370
- It is good.

09:38.412 --> 09:40.038
Thank you, I guess

09:38.412 --> 09:40.038
that's the last we'll hear

09:40.080 --> 09:42.623
about Joey being a bad cook.

09:42.665 --> 09:44.501
You know, it tastes

09:42.665 --> 09:44.501
a little like the<i> Lo mien</i>

09:44.543 --> 09:46.794
at Uncle Wu's

09:44.543 --> 09:46.794
Chinese palace.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.047
- Mm-hmm.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.047
- Yes, it does.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.091
Except it's much better.

09:51.132 --> 09:53.843
Thank you, Stephanie.

09:55.929 --> 09:59.182
So sweetie, what movie

09:55.929 --> 09:59.182
should we see tonight?

09:59.224 --> 10:01.809
Uh-uh...we-we'll decide

09:59.224 --> 10:01.809
on the way.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.646
So, D.J., how was

10:03.520 --> 10:05.646
your day at school?

10:05.688 --> 10:06.856
Fine.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.902
Uh, uh, Steph, h-how was your

10:08.316 --> 10:10.902
day at school today?

10:10.944 --> 10:12.153
Fine.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.658
Normally, you can't

10:15.323 --> 10:17.658
shut 'em up.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.453
Daniel, you have

10:17.700 --> 10:19.453
an exciting career.

10:19.494 --> 10:21.079
How was your day

10:19.494 --> 10:21.079
at work today?

10:21.121 --> 10:22.330
Fine.

10:23.331 --> 10:26.709
Mmm, this food is yum.

10:26.751 --> 10:29.045
You know, Jesse and I met

10:26.751 --> 10:29.045
in a Chinese restaurant.

10:29.087 --> 10:31.965
I don't think they wanna

10:29.087 --> 10:31.965
hear about that, Jill.

10:32.006 --> 10:33.258
Oh, I'd love to.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.759
Now she talks.

10:35.676 --> 10:36.761
Well, Jesse came in to pick up

10:36.803 --> 10:39.389
a take-out order

10:36.803 --> 10:39.389
with baby Michelle.

10:39.431 --> 10:41.433
There's something

10:39.431 --> 10:41.433
about a man with a baby

10:41.475 --> 10:43.518
that's so sexy

10:43.560 --> 10:47.147
and so...hard to resist.

10:47.188 --> 10:49.816
Oh, it's becoming easier.

10:51.734 --> 10:54.070
You use my baby to meet women?

10:56.072 --> 10:59.242
Michelle, tomorrow you're coming

10:56.072 --> 10:59.242
with<i> me</i> to the market.

11:01.244 --> 11:04.831
Once Jesse got me to kiss

11:01.244 --> 11:04.831
the baby, I was hooked.

11:06.166 --> 11:10.086
Really? Did you blow

11:06.166 --> 11:10.086
on her tummy too?

11:10.128 --> 11:12.964
Yeah, the first time I met her.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.591
How did you know?

11:14.633 --> 11:17.218
[chuckles]

11:14.633 --> 11:17.218
Just some crazy hunch.

11:20.388 --> 11:23.016
Uncle Jesse, is the food

11:20.388 --> 11:23.016
too spicy for you?

11:23.057 --> 11:24.351
No, why?

11:24.392 --> 11:25.810
Because you're

11:24.392 --> 11:25.810
sweating bullets.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.730
[instrumental music]

11:31.608 --> 11:32.900
(Robin)

11:31.608 --> 11:32.900
'And turning to local news'

11:32.942 --> 11:34.194
substantial rainfall at

11:34.235 --> 11:36.029
key northern watersheds

11:34.235 --> 11:36.029
has eliminated the--

11:36.070 --> 11:37.572
- Hello! Hello! Hello!

11:36.070 --> 11:37.572
- Hey, Jess.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.199
Hope I'm not

11:37.614 --> 11:39.199
interrupting anything.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.450
Oh, not at all,

11:39.240 --> 11:40.450
Robin and I were

11:40.492 --> 11:41.951
just working on

11:40.492 --> 11:41.951
her audition piece.

11:41.993 --> 11:43.453
Great. Listen, this will

11:41.993 --> 11:43.453
just take a few minutes.

11:43.495 --> 11:45.455
I need to talk to Robin

11:43.495 --> 11:45.455
privately, please.

11:45.497 --> 11:46.540
Sounds like my cue.

11:46.581 --> 11:48.749
Uh, no, Danny, don't go.

11:48.791 --> 11:52.128
Jesse, if this is about Jill

11:48.791 --> 11:52.128
there's nothing to explain.

11:52.170 --> 11:53.505
Yes, there is,

11:52.170 --> 11:53.505
I want you to know that

11:53.547 --> 11:54.839
there's nothing between us.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.007
Jesse, we just met!

11:56.049 --> 11:57.551
There is no reason in the world

11:57.592 --> 11:59.594
why you should feel bad

11:57.592 --> 11:59.594
about having a date tonight.

11:59.636 --> 12:01.555
Great, so we're still

11:59.636 --> 12:01.555
going out tomorrow night?

12:01.596 --> 12:03.097
Well, you know, I've been

12:01.596 --> 12:03.097
thinking about this

12:03.139 --> 12:04.599
and it's probably

12:03.139 --> 12:04.599
not a good idea.

12:04.641 --> 12:07.060
I should be focusing

12:04.641 --> 12:07.060
on my career.

12:07.101 --> 12:10.313
Did I hear you say you're

12:07.101 --> 12:10.313
breaking our date?

12:10.355 --> 12:11.523
Did I just hear Michelle?

12:11.565 --> 12:13.400
Danny, don't go.

12:11.565 --> 12:13.400
Yes, Jesse.

12:13.441 --> 12:17.320
I'm sorry, but I am.

12:13.441 --> 12:17.320
I'm breaking our date.

12:17.362 --> 12:19.531
- No.

12:17.362 --> 12:19.531
- Yes.

12:19.573 --> 12:20.865
No.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.492
Yes.

12:22.534 --> 12:24.827
Jesse, she's breaking the date.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.413
No.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.956
(together)

12:26.454 --> 12:28.956
Yes.

12:28.998 --> 12:30.749
The truth is, seeing you

12:28.998 --> 12:30.749
and Jill together

12:30.791 --> 12:33.545
it made me realize I've

12:30.791 --> 12:33.545
been out with you before.

12:33.587 --> 12:35.088
Not in this life.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.591
Oh, I..

12:35.129 --> 12:37.591
In a past life.

12:37.632 --> 12:41.720
We doubled with Shirley Maclaine

12:37.632 --> 12:41.720
and King Tut, right?

12:41.760 --> 12:43.221
Okay, that was very cute.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.889
See, I'm cute now.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.889
You think I'm cute now.

12:44.931 --> 12:47.934
I am adorable on

12:44.931 --> 12:47.934
a date. Tell her.

12:47.975 --> 12:50.311
He's a fox.

12:50.353 --> 12:53.064
What I meant is,

12:50.353 --> 12:53.064
I've been out with..

12:53.106 --> 12:54.566
...your type before

12:54.608 --> 12:56.568
and it always gets me

12:54.608 --> 12:56.568
into trouble, Jesse.

12:56.610 --> 12:58.069
Oh, I'm a type!

12:58.111 --> 12:59.862
I'm sure there's someplace

12:58.111 --> 12:59.862
else I have to be.

12:59.904 --> 13:02.699
Sit down!

13:02.741 --> 13:05.159
You don't wanna miss this. She's

13:02.741 --> 13:05.159
about to tell me about my type.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.621
Go ahead, go ahead.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.621
Type away.

13:07.662 --> 13:08.913
Alright.

13:08.955 --> 13:12.041
I'll tell you exactly

13:08.955 --> 13:12.041
what your type is.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.502
You're the guitar-playing,

13:12.083 --> 13:14.502
leather-wearing

13:14.544 --> 13:16.921
Elvis-loving,

13:14.544 --> 13:16.921
motorcycle-riding

13:16.963 --> 13:18.757
girl-chasing,

13:16.963 --> 13:18.757
blow-drying

13:18.797 --> 13:22.385
baby-toting tough-guy type.

13:18.797 --> 13:22.385
How's that?

13:22.427 --> 13:24.471
Lucky guess.

13:24.512 --> 13:25.846
- But you got me.

13:24.512 --> 13:25.846
- Yeah.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.724
'You got me on that one.'

13:27.766 --> 13:30.101
Robin, sit down.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.103
See, I'm other types too. I'm..

13:32.145 --> 13:34.606
I'm-I'm the romantic type.

13:34.648 --> 13:38.192
I'm, uh,

13:34.648 --> 13:38.192
I'm the compassionate type.

13:38.234 --> 13:41.028
I'm the type that's

13:38.234 --> 13:41.028
attracted to your type.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.448
Really?

13:45.158 --> 13:48.035
Is anyone aware of the fact

13:45.158 --> 13:48.035
that I'm still in the room?

13:48.077 --> 13:49.579
- Excuse me.

13:48.077 --> 13:49.579
- Uh, Danny.

13:49.621 --> 13:51.998
Don't you dare leave now.

13:52.039 --> 13:54.208
Jesse, there's one more

13:52.039 --> 13:54.208
thing about your type.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.834
I will take bets

13:54.250 --> 13:55.834
that you have not had

13:55.876 --> 13:57.420
a relationship last

13:55.876 --> 13:57.420
for more than 3 months.

13:57.462 --> 13:58.463
Am I right or am I right?

13:58.505 --> 13:59.838
- Wrong!

13:58.505 --> 13:59.838
- Wrong?

13:59.880 --> 14:01.090
Wrong, I was madly in love

13:59.880 --> 14:01.090
with this girl named

14:01.132 --> 14:03.884
Sharon...uh, Sharon.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.553
- Edwards.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.553
- Edwards. Sharon Edwards.

14:05.595 --> 14:06.929
I was madly in love

14:05.595 --> 14:06.929
with Sharon Edwards

14:06.971 --> 14:08.682
for four beautiful months.

14:08.723 --> 14:10.350
I remember her.

14:10.391 --> 14:12.268
Didn't she spend two of those

14:10.391 --> 14:12.268
beautiful months in Europe?

14:12.310 --> 14:14.562
Get out. Get out.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.562
Get out of here!

14:14.604 --> 14:16.773
Yes, I can leave now. Ha! Ha!

14:16.815 --> 14:17.856
I'm off now to patch up

14:17.898 --> 14:20.401
that pesky Iran-Iraq squabble.

14:23.321 --> 14:25.824
[sighs]

14:25.865 --> 14:27.074
The truth?

14:28.576 --> 14:30.662
I'm afraid of

14:28.576 --> 14:30.662
getting hurt again.

14:30.704 --> 14:33.289
Guys like you and I,

14:30.704 --> 14:33.289
we never work out

14:33.331 --> 14:35.625
because we're totally

14:33.331 --> 14:35.625
different people.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.752
Yes, but Robin, that's

14:35.667 --> 14:37.752
the exciting part.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.420
That's the beauty

14:37.794 --> 14:39.420
of this thing.

14:39.462 --> 14:43.049
We're like...like fire

14:39.462 --> 14:43.049
and ice, you and me.

14:43.090 --> 14:45.176
Do you know what you get

14:43.090 --> 14:45.176
with fire and ice?

14:45.218 --> 14:48.095
Yeah...steam.

14:49.930 --> 14:52.684
A puddle!

14:49.930 --> 14:52.684
Goodnight, Jesse.

14:52.726 --> 14:54.143
Well, that's it. I'm not

14:52.726 --> 14:54.143
taking no for an answer.

14:54.185 --> 14:55.812
I'm not going out

14:54.185 --> 14:55.812
with you. Goodnight.

14:55.854 --> 14:57.313
But thank you very much for

14:55.854 --> 14:57.313
letting me use your room.

14:57.355 --> 14:58.981
I'm kicking you

14:57.355 --> 14:58.981
out of your own room.

14:59.023 --> 15:01.192
- Oh, thank you very much.

14:59.023 --> 15:01.192
- You're welcome very much.

15:01.234 --> 15:04.863
And don't touch

15:01.234 --> 15:04.863
any of my records!

15:04.904 --> 15:06.280
Hi.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.660
We were just, uh..

15:10.702 --> 15:11.828
...talking and--

15:11.870 --> 15:13.162
Oh, it's-it's none

15:11.870 --> 15:13.162
of our business.

15:13.204 --> 15:14.873
We were all just

15:13.204 --> 15:14.873
passing in the hall

15:14.914 --> 15:17.584
at the exact same time.

15:17.625 --> 15:20.044
Uncle Jesse, you

15:17.625 --> 15:20.044
really like her, huh?

15:20.086 --> 15:22.088
No, I don't like her.

15:22.129 --> 15:25.383
I'll admit at first there was

15:22.129 --> 15:25.383
a wee bit of an attraction.

15:27.009 --> 15:31.013
[sighs]

15:27.009 --> 15:31.013
Yes, I really like her.

15:31.055 --> 15:32.515
This is the worst

15:31.055 --> 15:32.515
breakup ever

15:32.557 --> 15:35.142
in my whole entire life.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.977
And I haven't even been

15:35.184 --> 15:36.977
out with her yet.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.193
[instrumental music]

15:45.862 --> 15:47.572
Fellas, look. I'm alright.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.867
It's over. Her loss.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.867
I'm moving on.

15:50.909 --> 15:52.952
You can't fool your roomie.

15:52.993 --> 15:55.329
Joseph, why

15:52.993 --> 15:55.329
don't you believe me?

15:55.371 --> 15:56.956
Because you were up

15:55.371 --> 15:56.956
almost the whole night

15:56.997 --> 15:59.751
singing "Heartbreak Hotel"

15:56.997 --> 15:59.751
in your sleep.

15:59.793 --> 16:02.086
Jesse, you always rush

15:59.793 --> 16:02.086
into everything.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.421
Why don't you

16:02.128 --> 16:03.421
just slow down?

16:03.463 --> 16:06.132
Let her get to know you.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.132
Be her friend first.

16:06.173 --> 16:07.842
Friends are what

16:06.173 --> 16:07.842
you're forced to become

16:07.884 --> 16:09.427
after you break up.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.888
Look, guys, it doesn't

16:09.469 --> 16:11.888
matter, okay? I'm fine.

16:11.930 --> 16:13.681
Oh, yeah? Is that why

16:11.930 --> 16:13.681
you just served me

16:13.723 --> 16:16.225
the leaning tower

16:13.723 --> 16:16.225
of French toast?

16:17.644 --> 16:19.520
You look thin.

16:19.562 --> 16:22.440
Oh, and I suppose

16:19.562 --> 16:22.440
I'm King Kong Bundy?

16:24.233 --> 16:26.402
You're getting so pretty.

16:26.444 --> 16:28.195
Can I help you

16:26.444 --> 16:28.195
with your nails?

16:28.237 --> 16:31.574
Sure, D.J., just try to stay

16:28.237 --> 16:31.574
above the cuticles, okay?

16:32.784 --> 16:34.452
Are there any other

16:32.784 --> 16:34.452
parts on your body

16:34.494 --> 16:36.329
that I can help with?

16:36.370 --> 16:38.331
Ah, would you like

16:36.370 --> 16:38.331
to brush my hair?

16:38.372 --> 16:42.335
Alright!

16:38.372 --> 16:42.335
Much better than nails.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.964
When you get the job

16:44.337 --> 16:45.964
and move here..

16:46.005 --> 16:47.966
...you can come visit us

16:46.005 --> 16:47.966
all the time.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.009
And date Uncle Jesse.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.678
Well, I would love to

16:50.050 --> 16:51.678
see the two of you

16:51.719 --> 16:53.053
but you know,

16:51.719 --> 16:53.053
I wouldn't count on me

16:53.095 --> 16:54.597
dating your Uncle Jesse.

16:54.639 --> 16:56.557
You know, David and Maddie

16:54.639 --> 16:56.557
on "Moonlighting"

16:56.599 --> 16:58.685
didn't like each other

16:56.599 --> 16:58.685
at first, either.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.855
Uncle Jesse's

16:59.686 --> 17:01.855
a great catch.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.189
He can sing.

17:03.230 --> 17:05.274
And he gives fun

17:03.230 --> 17:05.274
piggyback rides.

17:05.316 --> 17:07.902
He's got an awesome

17:05.316 --> 17:07.902
head of hair.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.570
And he teaches you to ride

17:09.612 --> 17:12.448
a 2-wheeler without

17:09.612 --> 17:12.448
training wheels.

17:12.490 --> 17:14.450
As long as you don't

17:12.490 --> 17:14.450
ride in the street.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.744
Oh, you know,

17:14.492 --> 17:16.744
you two are so sweet.

17:16.786 --> 17:19.121
I only hope someday that I

17:16.786 --> 17:19.121
have nieces just like you.

17:19.163 --> 17:22.416
Marry Uncle Jesse

17:19.163 --> 17:22.416
and you will.

17:22.458 --> 17:23.626
'Good morning, girls.'

17:23.668 --> 17:25.837
- 'Morning. Morning.'

17:23.668 --> 17:25.837
- Hi, Robin.

17:25.879 --> 17:27.005
Good morning, Jesse.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.130
Come on, girls, I'll

17:27.046 --> 17:28.130
give you a ride

17:28.172 --> 17:29.841
to school in my bug-mobile.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.091
Shotgun!

17:31.133 --> 17:32.927
No fair. I gotta get

17:31.133 --> 17:32.927
my milk money.

17:32.969 --> 17:34.679
Okay. Hurry up, kid.

17:32.969 --> 17:34.679
I'll wait for you.

17:37.139 --> 17:38.599
Ow! Ow! Ow!

17:37.139 --> 17:38.599
Ow! Ow!

17:38.641 --> 17:40.434
What, what, what, what,

17:38.641 --> 17:40.434
what, what, what, what?

17:40.476 --> 17:41.644
Let me see! Let me see!

17:40.476 --> 17:41.644
Let me see!

17:41.686 --> 17:44.731
Aw, uh, uh, oh! You're in luck.

17:44.772 --> 17:47.400
It just so happens that I went

17:44.772 --> 17:47.400
to finger college, okay?

17:47.441 --> 17:49.027
Now in order to

17:47.441 --> 17:49.027
treat your finger

17:49.068 --> 17:51.153
I've got to know

17:49.068 --> 17:51.153
what color the pain is.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.655
'What you have to do is

17:51.195 --> 17:52.655
close your eyes'

17:52.697 --> 17:54.114
put your finger

17:52.697 --> 17:54.114
on your nose

17:54.156 --> 17:56.158
and that way we can tell

17:54.156 --> 17:56.158
what color the pain is.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.911
Come on, do it.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.911
I'm the finger doctor.

17:57.952 --> 18:01.622
Okay, very good.

17:57.952 --> 18:01.622
Now, what color is the pain?

18:01.664 --> 18:03.290
It's kind of green.

18:03.332 --> 18:06.210
It's kind of green?

18:03.332 --> 18:06.210
Any other colors?

18:06.252 --> 18:07.587
How about polka dots?

18:07.628 --> 18:10.757
Yeah, there's polka dots.

18:07.628 --> 18:10.757
Blue ones.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.967
Blue ones.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.967
Any stripes?

18:13.009 --> 18:14.093
No stripes.

18:14.134 --> 18:15.511
Oh, good! That's good.

18:15.553 --> 18:16.846
Because stripes are dangerous.

18:16.888 --> 18:18.639
'Alright, this is

18:16.888 --> 18:18.639
easy to diagnose.'

18:18.681 --> 18:21.559
Nine out of ten doctors

18:18.681 --> 18:21.559
will agree

18:21.601 --> 18:24.604
that we can solve the pain

18:21.601 --> 18:24.604
by opening your eyes

18:24.645 --> 18:28.107
and taking your finger

18:24.645 --> 18:28.107
off your nose.

18:28.148 --> 18:31.485
It's gone.

18:28.148 --> 18:31.485
Thanks, Uncle Jesse.

18:32.236 --> 18:33.571
Alright. No charge.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.074
We'll put it on your

18:33.613 --> 18:36.074
father's medical insurance.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.785
You're wasting

18:36.115 --> 18:38.785
your time killing bugs.

18:38.826 --> 18:40.202
Come on. I'll give you

18:38.826 --> 18:40.202
a piggyback ride.

18:40.244 --> 18:41.913
Here we go! Here we go!

18:41.955 --> 18:43.205
Up!

18:43.247 --> 18:45.750
Good luck today.

18:43.247 --> 18:45.750
What a guy, huh?

18:49.754 --> 18:52.172
And there were no fights

18:49.754 --> 18:52.172
in hockey today.

18:52.214 --> 18:54.508
Finally, Michelle would

18:52.214 --> 18:54.508
like to thank all of you

18:54.550 --> 18:56.510
for your calls asking

18:54.550 --> 18:56.510
her to be a regular

18:56.552 --> 18:58.972
on the 4 o'clock sports.

18:59.013 --> 19:01.599
Yesterday, Michelle

18:59.013 --> 19:01.599
picked the warriors by five.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.225
And son of a gun.

19:03.267 --> 19:06.687
Son of a gun if they

19:03.267 --> 19:06.687
didn't win 106-101.

19:06.729 --> 19:09.816
But I'm afraid Michelle

19:06.729 --> 19:09.816
is retiring as odds maker.

19:09.857 --> 19:12.944
That's right, to resume her

19:09.857 --> 19:12.944
former career of eating

19:12.986 --> 19:15.529
learning to talk, and burping.

19:15.571 --> 19:18.074
[laughs]

19:18.116 --> 19:19.283
Well, that's sports.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.452
This is Danny

19:19.325 --> 19:21.452
and Michelle Tanner

19:21.494 --> 19:24.371
saying bye-bye

19:21.494 --> 19:24.371
and bye-bye.

19:24.413 --> 19:25.957
So long, San Francisco..

19:25.999 --> 19:27.708
...until 6:00. See you then.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.085
(Derek)

19:27.750 --> 19:29.085
'We're off the air.'

19:29.127 --> 19:32.046
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.

19:32.088 --> 19:33.756
Jesse, thanks for

19:32.088 --> 19:33.756
picking up Michelle.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.842
No problem. Everybody

19:33.798 --> 19:35.842
has a purpose in life.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.094
Mine is chauffeuring

19:35.883 --> 19:38.094
around little babies.

19:38.136 --> 19:40.220
- Keep up the good work.

19:38.136 --> 19:40.220
- Okay.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.348
"Substantial rainfall

19:40.262 --> 19:42.348

Now, what does this--"

19:48.437 --> 19:51.565
Hi! Hi!

19:51.607 --> 19:53.192
What? What is it, Jesse?

19:53.233 --> 19:55.820
Well, Michelle was

19:53.233 --> 19:55.820
just, uh, saying

19:55.862 --> 19:57.279
how interesting it was.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.406
Don't do that Michelle

19:57.321 --> 19:59.406
business, please.

19:59.448 --> 20:00.908
You didn't like it. Be honest.

20:02.326 --> 20:05.872
How do I say this without

20:02.326 --> 20:05.872
hurting your feelings?

20:05.913 --> 20:07.373
It put me to sleep.

20:07.414 --> 20:09.792
That's not how you'd say it.

20:09.834 --> 20:13.253
Robin, you have something

20:09.834 --> 20:13.253
special inside you.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.965
You gotta let it out.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.965
You gotta show some energy.

20:17.050 --> 20:19.635
Auditions scare me to death.

20:19.677 --> 20:21.054
You have to have fun,

20:19.677 --> 20:21.054
I mean, you know?

20:21.095 --> 20:23.181
You have to have fun,

20:21.095 --> 20:23.181
like the kid.

20:24.348 --> 20:27.476
You can't be afraid

20:24.348 --> 20:27.476
to get crazy.

20:27.518 --> 20:29.020
Let me show you. Let me show you

20:27.518 --> 20:29.020
What I'm talking about? Here.

20:29.062 --> 20:32.523
- Okay.

20:29.062 --> 20:32.523
- Hold the baby. Come here.

20:32.565 --> 20:33.691
It's gotta be

20:32.565 --> 20:33.691
something like this.

20:33.733 --> 20:34.901
Okay.

20:36.318 --> 20:39.155
Hello, San Francisco.

20:36.318 --> 20:39.155
How the heck are you?

Jesse Cochran here,

substantial rainfall

20:46.412 --> 20:49.040
in key northern watersheds."

20:46.412 --> 20:49.040
What does that mean?

20:49.082 --> 20:51.584
No more having to beg for

20:49.082 --> 20:51.584
water in restaurants.

20:51.625 --> 20:54.087
Take longer showers.

20:51.625 --> 20:54.087
Wash your car every day.

20:54.128 --> 20:56.881
And hey, yank that brick out

20:54.128 --> 20:56.881
of the toilet, huh?

20:56.923 --> 20:59.425
San Francisco,

20:56.923 --> 20:59.425
the good life is back.

20:59.466 --> 21:02.178
We've got water

21:07.641 --> 21:09.185
You see? That's it.

21:07.641 --> 21:09.185
You've got to laugh.

21:09.227 --> 21:10.561
You've got to smile.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.438
That's what you have to

21:10.603 --> 21:12.438
put into your audition.

21:12.479 --> 21:14.398
'We've got to beef up

21:12.479 --> 21:14.398
security in here.'

21:14.440 --> 21:17.110
'Miss Winslow, you're on.'

21:17.151 --> 21:19.779
She's beautiful. She's

21:17.151 --> 21:19.779
intelligent. She's charming.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.447
Everything that I

21:19.820 --> 21:21.447
want in a newswoman.

21:21.488 --> 21:24.491
Ladies and gentlemen, may I

21:21.488 --> 21:24.491
present Miss Robin Winslow.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.786
Give me the kid.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.246
Thank you, young man..

21:28.287 --> 21:30.456
...whoever he was.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.456
I don't know.

21:32.250 --> 21:35.711
Hello, San Francisco.

21:32.250 --> 21:35.711
This is Robin Winslow.

newest field reporter.

21:46.764 --> 21:49.683
(together)

21:46.764 --> 21:49.683
Alright!

21:49.725 --> 21:53.187
And to all of you for

21:49.725 --> 21:53.187
all of your help, thank you.

21:53.229 --> 21:54.688
You're welcome.

21:54.730 --> 21:56.440
What did you do?

21:56.482 --> 21:57.691
I don't know.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.568
But when somebody

21:57.733 --> 21:59.568
says thank you

21:59.610 --> 22:02.362
you're supposed to

21:59.610 --> 22:02.362
say, "you're welcome."

22:02.404 --> 22:03.656
Jesse, can I

22:02.404 --> 22:03.656
have a word with you?

22:03.697 --> 22:06.117
Sure. Will you excuse us?

22:06.159 --> 22:08.953
You're excused.

22:06.159 --> 22:08.953
I love being polite.

22:15.709 --> 22:18.712
I just wanted to thank you

22:15.709 --> 22:18.712
for all your help.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.506
Hey, I'm happy to do it.

22:20.547 --> 22:22.258
Which part helped you

22:20.547 --> 22:22.258
out the most?

22:22.300 --> 22:25.052
Oh, I'd have to say it was

22:22.300 --> 22:25.052
your insane newscast.

22:25.094 --> 22:27.429
It was so awful,

22:25.094 --> 22:27.429
it made me look terrific.

22:27.471 --> 22:29.849
That was all part of my plan.

22:29.890 --> 22:32.268
I was wrong about you.

22:32.310 --> 22:34.561
You're different than all the

22:32.310 --> 22:34.561
other "yous" I've dated before

22:34.603 --> 22:36.438
but do you know

22:34.603 --> 22:36.438
what I like most?

22:36.480 --> 22:37.815
Hmm. Let's see.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.692
How about my love

22:37.857 --> 22:39.692
for adventure?

22:39.733 --> 22:42.236
Uh, the way I live

22:39.733 --> 22:42.236
my life on the edge?

22:42.278 --> 22:44.530
Your strong

22:42.278 --> 22:44.530
maternal instincts.

22:44.571 --> 22:46.699
The words I've been

22:44.571 --> 22:46.699
dying to hear from a woman.

22:49.243 --> 22:52.246
Oh, boy, how

22:49.243 --> 22:52.246
did this happen?

22:52.288 --> 22:54.623
I never even used to like kids

22:52.288 --> 22:54.623
until I talked to one.

22:54.665 --> 22:56.667
Well, you've got

22:54.665 --> 22:56.667
a terrific family here.

22:56.709 --> 22:59.045
Those girls really adore you.

22:59.086 --> 23:01.797
And I'm beginning to see why.

23:01.839 --> 23:03.465
Listen, Robin, I'm

23:01.839 --> 23:03.465
not the type of guy

23:03.507 --> 23:06.927
that just rushes

23:03.507 --> 23:06.927
into relationships, okay?

23:06.969 --> 23:09.555
I think you and I

23:06.969 --> 23:09.555
should become friends.

23:09.596 --> 23:10.890
I'd like that.

23:10.931 --> 23:13.726
Good. So we'll just

23:10.931 --> 23:13.726
be friends. Period.

23:13.767 --> 23:14.935
You've got it, buddy.

23:14.977 --> 23:17.355
Alright, pal.

23:17.395 --> 23:20.607
But listen, now if you want to

23:17.395 --> 23:20.607
go beyond this friendship thing

23:20.649 --> 23:22.151
you're gonna have to

23:20.649 --> 23:22.151
make the first move, okay?

23:22.193 --> 23:24.111
'cause it's not gonna be me.

23:24.153 --> 23:26.197
I understand that.

23:26.239 --> 23:28.324
Let's get back

23:26.239 --> 23:28.324
to the party. Come on.

23:28.366 --> 23:30.534
Robin, I'm curious,

23:28.366 --> 23:30.534
if you did happen

23:30.576 --> 23:32.119
to make that first move,

23:30.576 --> 23:32.119
what would it be?

23:32.161 --> 23:34.412
I mean, I-I would

23:32.161 --> 23:34.412
hate to miss it.

23:34.454 --> 23:37.375
Trust me, if I made

23:34.454 --> 23:37.375
a move, you'd know it.

23:37.415 --> 23:38.876
Okay, pal?

23:38.918 --> 23:41.087
Okay, little buddy.

23:47.801 --> 23:49.469
Was that a move?

23:49.511 --> 23:50.846
Did your toes curl?

23:50.888 --> 23:53.182
Yeah. Does that mean

23:50.888 --> 23:53.182
you're making a move?

23:53.224 --> 23:56.018
No, when I make a move..

23:57.144 --> 23:58.812
...everything curls.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.025
Have mercy!
