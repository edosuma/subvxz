I've never gotten them
this stirred up before.

09:15.790 --> 09:18.959
- Okay, so what's the plan?
- Ah, give them a little time.

09:18.960 --> 09:23.539
They'll cool down, and then
we'll never have another
neighbor bother us again.

09:23.540 --> 09:26.669
Right. They'll stop being angry
and go back to being afraid.

09:26.670 --> 09:29.079
Can't even have
a neighborhood barbecue.

09:29.080 --> 09:31.879

Things'll go back to normal.

What about you, boy?
I thought you were on my side.

I... didn't think it
would get this bad, Gramma.

09:37.620 --> 09:41.039

threatening our lives

No more...

- Everyone get her!

09:49.750 --> 09:52.379
- Gramma, what're you...
- Halt!

09:52.380 --> 09:56.039
People that live near us,
I have something to show you!

09:56.040 --> 09:58.879
Something I've kept hidden
from you all these years.

09:58.880 --> 10:01.499
I don't really follow,
Gramma. What're you...

10:01.500 --> 10:04.379

10:18.580 --> 10:21.419
Y'all looked like a bunch
of sad losers in there,

10:24.960 --> 10:27.999
I've got to compromise and do
what's best for all of you.

- [all] Aw!

10:41.960 --> 10:45.619
- You're a regular gramma!
- You're just like my gramma!

10:45.620 --> 10:47.619
Can we play sometime, old lady?

10:47.620 --> 10:50.249
[shuddering]
See what I do for you all?

10:50.250 --> 10:52.920
Hey, what do you say we get back
to having a barbecue!

10:53.920 --> 10:55.249
Hey, nice crisscross!

10:55.250 --> 10:57.079
[giggling]

10:57.080 --> 10:58.919
Oh, can I try some
of that barrel water?

10:58.920 --> 11:01.249
[Tilly] You don't
drink barrel water!

11:01.250 --> 11:02.830
[kite cackling]
