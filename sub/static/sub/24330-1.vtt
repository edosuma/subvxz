00:54.100 --> 00:54.840
Ah...

01:42.860 --> 01:44.070
Stop, stop!

01:44.120 --> 01:47.230
Kirsten, now, now, calm yourself.

01:47.280 --> 01:48.310
There.

01:48.860 --> 01:52.310
There, there, there. Shuh, Shuh!

01:52.580 --> 01:53.960
There, there...

02:21.760 --> 02:24.350
She was alive when I left
the house. I hitched a lift.

02:24.400 --> 02:25.830
It was a good car. It was big.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.670
It was practically brand-new.

02:27.720 --> 02:29.150
The driver was in his 30s.

02:29.200 --> 02:32.790
He was wearing a dark overcoat and
a striped shirt and I saw the cuff.

02:32.840 --> 02:34.710
It was striped, like pyjamas.

02:34.760 --> 02:37.790
- I'm sorry, am I boring you, Father?
- If you had a name...

02:37.840 --> 02:40.880
I didn't ask his name. I
didn't know I'd be needing it.

02:42.440 --> 02:44.670
All your life, you've courted trouble

02:44.720 --> 02:46.800
and never faced any consequences.

02:48.640 --> 02:51.510
But you have to face the
consequences now, Jack.

02:51.560 --> 02:54.360
- You have to.
- I didn't kill her.

02:56.040 --> 02:58.270
Please, find that man, find that man.

02:58.320 --> 02:59.790
He can prove it.

02:59.840 --> 03:01.520
I didn't do it.

03:03.320 --> 03:04.360
Perfect match.

03:05.600 --> 03:08.080
'And that's the last twist
of the knife, Jack.'

03:10.800 --> 03:13.480
Your refusal to admit what you have done.

03:15.640 --> 03:16.800
It was you.

03:18.680 --> 03:21.590
Your fingerprints mixed

03:21.640 --> 03:23.550
with your mother's blood.

03:23.600 --> 03:25.790
No-one else's.

03:25.840 --> 03:27.000
Yours, Jack.

03:39.120 --> 03:45.870
I'd hoped that, one day, he might
understand what he had done to us.

03:45.920 --> 03:50.480
I'd hoped your brother
might, one day, be sorry.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.470
He wasn't.

04:01.440 --> 04:03.480
But we forgive him because we loved him.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.160
And now...

04:09.360 --> 04:13.110
.. we have to look after each
other and keep on living.

04:55.520 --> 04:57.710
Michael? Christina?

04:57.760 --> 05:00.430
These are your new sisters and brother.

05:00.480 --> 05:02.390
Mary, Hester and Jack.

05:02.440 --> 05:04.710
You'll be very happy here.

05:04.760 --> 05:07.840
A good bath, tea and then straight to bed.

05:30.240 --> 05:32.040
Aren't you grubby little tykes?

05:58.520 --> 06:00.030
Everybody ready?

06:00.080 --> 06:01.990
That's quite tight, Jack.

06:02.040 --> 06:03.080
Smile, Mother.

06:04.480 --> 06:06.080
So everyone knows we are happy.

06:07.320 --> 06:09.240
Best faces, please.

07:18.840 --> 07:20.550
Leo!

07:20.600 --> 07:22.710
I'm off now.

07:22.760 --> 07:24.520
Don't lose track of the time.

07:30.440 --> 07:32.160
Bloody... hell.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.390
All the cuttings raked up.

08:09.440 --> 08:13.080
- All the cuttings! - Yes,
ma'am. - I'll be checking.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.110
'There are, of course,

08:27.160 --> 08:29.390
some concerns about the high risk of fire

08:29.440 --> 08:31.790
should there be an atomic
detonation in Britain.

08:31.840 --> 08:33.429
But people must remember

08:33.480 --> 08:36.110
that our homes are built very differently

08:36.159 --> 08:38.669
to the domestic architecture in Japan.

08:38.720 --> 08:42.870
There, the houses are made from
light, highly flammable materials,

08:42.919 --> 08:45.310
such as paper and card...

08:45.360 --> 08:47.750
- Kirsten? - .. and any
schoolchild will tell you

08:47.800 --> 08:50.200
that paper and card
burn quickly and easily.

08:56.480 --> 08:57.920
Kirsten!

09:08.840 --> 09:11.950
Why doesn't anyone in this house
answer when I call for them?

09:12.000 --> 09:13.040
I didn't hear you.

09:15.240 --> 09:17.190
My dress for this evening
is hanging in my room.

09:17.240 --> 09:18.870
It needs a press.

09:18.920 --> 09:21.270
And will you please cover your legs?

09:21.320 --> 09:22.950
Hosiery.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.190
No-one wants to see your chunky calves.

09:25.240 --> 09:26.670
Yes, Miss Vaughan.

09:26.720 --> 09:29.560
And no creases in the tablecloths.

09:40.920 --> 09:43.160
Nearest stop to Sunny Point, please.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.590
Hester?

10:02.640 --> 10:04.040
Hester!

10:06.880 --> 10:08.720
I don't know what you're smiling at.

10:10.920 --> 10:13.160
It's my house now.

10:30.280 --> 10:31.250
[Hester?]

10:31.800 --> 10:33.520
[Hester!]

10:55.840 --> 10:57.020
[Hester!]

11:16.920 --> 11:19.240
Honestly, Hester, we're going to be late.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.680
Right. In.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.950
I do have to go to work after this.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.790
I think fitting bridesmaids dresses

11:40.840 --> 11:43.190
is a teensy bit more
important than stamping books

11:43.240 --> 11:45.360
in a boring, bloody
library, actually, Tina.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.760
Now look what you've made me do.

13:10.120 --> 13:12.400
You ready for me, darling?]

14:38.600 --> 14:40.630
You need a shave.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.910
Don't they sell razors in London?

14:42.960 --> 14:45.230
- Where's your case?
- I'll get it in a minute.

14:45.280 --> 14:47.950
Well, well, the prodigal returns.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.510
Let's round up the fatted calf,

14:51.560 --> 14:55.840
slit its throat and sport
and play in its hot blood.

14:56.960 --> 14:58.790
- Philip.
- Mickey.

14:58.840 --> 15:00.630
Good, you're here.

15:00.680 --> 15:03.190
Finally. Come.

15:03.240 --> 15:04.640
Sorry, darling.

15:06.440 --> 15:09.200
It's only London, Mickey, you
could have got here sooner.

15:53.280 --> 15:54.710
Mickey, this sham of a wedding

15:54.760 --> 15:56.710
cannot go ahead and I'm relying on you.

15:56.760 --> 15:58.070
I'm the only one that cares

15:58.120 --> 16:00.510
that Daddy's marrying
that bloody secretary.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.150
Tina's like a ghost, Hester's
playing the innocent baby.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.670
It's as if mother never existed.

16:04.720 --> 16:06.350
You're cutting it a bit fine, aren't you?

16:06.400 --> 16:08.750
I mean, they're getting married
the day after tomorrow.

16:08.800 --> 16:11.550
Daddy isn't thinking clearly.
He's just blinded by S-E-X,

16:11.600 --> 16:14.590
which is all Gwenda's got,
but that works in our favour.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.990
I've got a plan.

16:16.040 --> 16:20.310
You pay her a lot of
attention and flatter her,

16:20.360 --> 16:22.430
let her see you looking at her.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.630
At her... curves.

16:24.680 --> 16:26.440
Letting your eyes linger.

16:27.440 --> 16:29.230
You make up to her

16:29.280 --> 16:31.280
and then, well, you know?

16:32.920 --> 16:34.590
- What?
- You make a pass at her.

16:34.640 --> 16:37.190
She responds, which she
will, because she's a tart,

16:37.240 --> 16:40.110
and we arrange it so that Daddy
catches her and she's gone.

16:40.160 --> 16:44.950
He throws her out and he'll be
upset, of course, but he'll have us.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.830
If he catches me up his fiancee,
he won't have me, will he?

16:47.880 --> 16:49.750
Yes, but I'll convince him it was all her.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.190
And you'll be completely forgiven

16:51.240 --> 16:53.750
because he'll realise you
are both just victims

16:53.800 --> 16:55.390
of the same gold-digging slut!

16:55.440 --> 16:57.990
Mary, you need to lie
down in a nice dark room

16:58.040 --> 17:00.640
for just about the rest of your life.

17:01.680 --> 17:04.310
I don't know why I ever
expected anything from you.

17:04.359 --> 17:07.470
You never help. You just swan off.

17:07.520 --> 17:10.319
To Korea, to your new life in London.

17:11.839 --> 17:14.640
It's all right for you, but the
rest of us have to stay here.

17:15.720 --> 17:18.310
Korea was a war, not a bloody holiday!

17:18.359 --> 17:20.960
Are you going to help save
Daddy from Gwenda, yes or no?

17:22.319 --> 17:23.359
No.

17:24.800 --> 17:26.000
Jack would have done it.

17:27.560 --> 17:28.910
Jack's not here.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.040
<Mickey?

17:36.680 --> 17:38.750
Dear boy!

17:38.800 --> 17:40.030
My best man.

17:40.080 --> 17:42.110
Mary, isn't this
wonderful? He's come home.

17:42.160 --> 17:43.280
Wonderful...

17:44.840 --> 17:46.630
This gathering tonight,

17:46.680 --> 17:49.670
I absolutely will not
mind if you slope off.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.110
There are so many people to thank

17:51.160 --> 17:53.840
and since the wedding itself
is only going to be us...

17:55.360 --> 17:57.590
Do you think it's too soon?

17:57.640 --> 18:00.310
- The party?
- Me marrying again.

18:00.360 --> 18:03.230
Mary's not taking it particularly well.

18:03.280 --> 18:05.080
She didn't say anything to me.

18:06.440 --> 18:08.880
I'm... I'm happy for you.

18:10.360 --> 18:12.390
That means a great deal, you know.

18:12.440 --> 18:13.920
A very great deal.

18:15.240 --> 18:17.270
Hester is giddy to see you.

18:17.320 --> 18:19.600
- Prepare yourself for
an onslaught. - Yes.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.700
It wouldn't have been the
same without you, son.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.080
I've missed you.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.600
Very much.

18:40.080 --> 18:41.920
A good bath, tea and straight to bed.

18:44.480 --> 18:45.560
Ah.

18:47.440 --> 18:48.920
And this is your new daddy.

18:50.640 --> 18:51.680
Hello.

18:55.160 --> 18:56.440
Come along.

19:08.520 --> 19:11.430
I say, I do hope that's not THE dress.

19:11.480 --> 19:13.350
No, that's going to the
hotel on the morning

19:13.400 --> 19:16.430
- so there's no danger of Leo seeing it.
- We saw it, though.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.950
It's white and that's all I'm saying.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.830
- Look who's here.
- Oh!

19:22.560 --> 19:24.190
Door, Hester, please.

19:24.240 --> 19:27.510
- But Mickey... - Will still be
there when you've answered the door.

19:27.560 --> 19:29.910
Michael, the tailor is coming tomorrow

19:29.960 --> 19:32.110
to make sure your morning suit fits.

19:32.160 --> 19:35.470
Hello, by the way. I'm so
glad that you could make it.

19:35.520 --> 19:37.470
Do you ever stop talking?

19:37.520 --> 19:39.590
You're very early.
Where's your instrument?

19:39.640 --> 19:41.190
My instrument?

19:41.240 --> 19:44.320
Your cello. And I do hope you
have something smarter to wear.

19:45.520 --> 19:47.390
- No, I...
- Oh, for God's sake.

19:47.440 --> 19:49.790
What is the matter with people?
This is a formal occasion.

19:49.840 --> 19:52.270
We can find something for him to wear.

19:52.320 --> 19:54.550
I'm not a musician.

19:54.600 --> 19:57.230
I'm Arthur Calgary.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.680
The man in the car.

20:01.440 --> 20:03.520
I'm Jack Argyll's alibi.

20:41.360 --> 20:43.480
My apologies for keeping you waiting.

20:50.440 --> 20:52.160
My family are very...

20:53.440 --> 20:55.190
.. shocked.

20:55.240 --> 20:56.320
Understandably so.

20:58.480 --> 21:00.350
You're an Egyptologist.

21:00.400 --> 21:03.840
- A gentleman amateur.
- Oh. Most of them are, aren't they?

21:10.960 --> 21:12.390
Mr Calgary...

21:12.440 --> 21:14.870
It's Doctor, actually.

21:14.920 --> 21:17.390
Not that I set particular store by titles.

21:17.440 --> 21:21.400
And not a doctor of
medicine. Science. Physics.

21:22.560 --> 21:24.750
Does that have a bearing
on this situation?

21:24.800 --> 21:26.760
It does, actually, yes.

21:28.880 --> 21:31.400
I came across this only very recently.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.960
And recognised him straightaway.

21:36.280 --> 21:39.190
It was Christmas Eve
1954 he flagged me down

21:39.240 --> 21:42.080
and I gave him a lift to the local town.

21:43.520 --> 21:45.790
I dropped him off outside
the public house.

21:45.840 --> 21:48.910
I asked him for the time.
I've never worn a watch.

21:48.960 --> 21:50.350
I'm late for everything.

21:50.400 --> 21:51.870
He told me it was just before nine,

21:51.920 --> 21:54.430
but it says here that your wife was...

21:54.480 --> 21:57.160
That she... died just before nine.

21:58.360 --> 22:01.270
But that's when your son was
with me some distance away, so...

22:01.320 --> 22:05.430
Where were you going when Jack
stopped you? What were you late for?

22:05.480 --> 22:07.830
A dinner party.

22:07.880 --> 22:11.840
I'm afraid the cliche about
absent-minded scientists is true.

22:16.080 --> 22:19.040
It's been 18 months since my wife was...

22:20.360 --> 22:22.800
.. killed. Why have you
not come forward before?

22:24.960 --> 22:26.120
I went away for my work.

22:27.600 --> 22:29.470
Just after Christmas.

22:29.520 --> 22:31.480
A research station in the Arctic.

22:34.800 --> 22:38.870
- The Arctic? - That's why I didn't see
any papers, hear any radio reports.

22:38.920 --> 22:40.430
I only got back in the last few days,

22:40.480 --> 22:42.710
and if this hadn't been
wrapped around some equipment,

22:42.760 --> 22:44.350
I wouldn't have known anything at all.

22:44.400 --> 22:47.550
You were going to a dinner party,
so you were wearing a dinner jacket?

22:47.600 --> 22:50.790
- That's right.
- I just want to be absolutely clear.

22:50.840 --> 22:54.230
A dinner suit. Black tie,
black jacket, black trousers?

22:54.280 --> 22:58.190
I wish I could have got here
sooner, but I'm here now,

22:58.240 --> 23:00.990
and I'm willing to go on oath in court.

23:01.040 --> 23:05.390
So your son con be released because
this terrible crime, Mr Argyll,

23:05.440 --> 23:07.350
he didn't do it.

23:07.400 --> 23:10.590
We've had a lot of people coming
here claiming to be Jack's alibi,

23:10.640 --> 23:13.040
to know something about
him, about our family.

23:14.040 --> 23:16.960
All those claims proved fraudulent.

23:18.080 --> 23:19.550
Well, obviously.

23:19.600 --> 23:22.550
Psychics, tarot readers.

23:22.600 --> 23:25.430
A water diviner turned up once.

23:25.480 --> 23:26.830
With rods.

23:26.880 --> 23:29.720
Greedy, venal people.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.950
Fame seekers and charlatans.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.840
You can imagine the hurt
and distress that caused us.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.710
It must have been awful,

23:40.760 --> 23:43.240
but I just want to do what's right.

23:44.360 --> 23:46.070
Jack was in my car.

23:46.120 --> 23:47.830
He's innocent.

23:47.880 --> 23:51.240
Well, once again, you're too late.

23:55.240 --> 23:58.800
Jack died in prison before
the case could come to trial.

24:04.200 --> 24:05.760
He died?

24:09.440 --> 24:11.040
He can't be dead. He...

24:12.680 --> 24:14.440
He has to be alive. He...

24:16.680 --> 24:18.040
He died how?

24:20.560 --> 24:22.920
He got into a fight with another inmate.

24:24.120 --> 24:26.470
Jack was a difficult young man.

24:26.520 --> 24:29.510
We loved him, but he was difficult.

24:29.560 --> 24:30.600
Disturbed.

24:33.280 --> 24:34.720
We hope he's at peace now.

24:41.800 --> 24:45.280
And I hope you'll leave us
to our own hard-won peace.

25:21.640 --> 25:23.510
I'm so sorry.

25:23.560 --> 25:25.190
Really.

25:25.240 --> 25:27.510
- So dreadfully sorry.
- Actually, we're all rather busy,

25:27.560 --> 25:30.080
- so if you wouldn't mind...
- Yes, of course.

25:31.240 --> 25:34.950
I don't suppose you know of any
hotels or boarding houses nearby?

25:35.000 --> 25:37.870
There's a hotel in town.
Good day, Doctor Calgary.

25:37.920 --> 25:40.440
Don't come back. There's
nothing for you here.

25:44.920 --> 25:47.150
No more information than
he'd read in the newspaper,

25:47.200 --> 25:50.710
like all the others. He said
he was wearing a dinner jacket

25:50.760 --> 25:52.190
so we know he was lying.

25:52.240 --> 25:54.550
I thought this had stopped.

25:54.600 --> 25:57.110
Why won't these ghouls
just leave us alone?

25:57.160 --> 25:58.590
He told me he's a physicist

25:58.640 --> 26:02.790
who's only just returned from
an expedition to the Arctic,

26:02.840 --> 26:05.360
which has got to be one
of the best ones yet.

26:06.600 --> 26:09.630
Forget about him. This
is not going to shake us.

26:09.680 --> 26:11.590
Hester, take those boxes upstairs.

26:11.640 --> 26:14.400
Kirsten, we'll have tea on the lawn.

26:17.240 --> 26:18.910
I'll take mine in my room.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.880
As you wish, Lieutenant Durrant.

26:26.040 --> 26:29.270
Strange turning up like
that out of the blue

26:29.320 --> 26:30.870
all this time later.

26:30.920 --> 26:32.910
Very... strange.

26:32.960 --> 26:35.910
Like my dad said, forget about him.

26:35.960 --> 26:38.070
Well, I'm sure we'll all give it a try,

26:38.120 --> 26:40.270
but it brings it all back, doesn't it?

26:40.320 --> 26:41.720
Like it was yesterday.

26:42.880 --> 26:44.920
Your poor, dear mother.

26:47.840 --> 26:48.760
"Butter".

26:49.960 --> 26:51.710
There are two Ts, Michael.

26:51.760 --> 26:54.670
Two of them. Christina can do it.

26:54.720 --> 26:55.760
Butter.

26:58.080 --> 26:59.910
Why can't you?

26:59.960 --> 27:01.000
Butter.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.600
But'er.

27:05.680 --> 27:06.720
Stand up.

27:07.880 --> 27:09.400
Look me in the eye and say it.

27:12.480 --> 27:13.520
But'er.

27:17.560 --> 27:18.600
Give me that.

27:23.800 --> 27:26.350
Kirsten, Michael has had a little mishap.

27:26.400 --> 27:29.720
A dab of disinfectant
and a plaster, I think.

27:35.360 --> 27:37.510
Mary, your French composition.

29:23.160 --> 29:24.910
Don't.

29:24.960 --> 29:26.630
Jack always said he was innocent.

29:26.680 --> 29:30.160
I'd say the same if I'd
been charged with murder.

29:34.920 --> 29:37.470
When we were standing around his coffin

29:37.520 --> 29:40.420
and they'd had to cover most of
his face so we couldn't see...

29:42.600 --> 29:45.350
.. what had been done to
him, how he'd been hurt,

29:45.400 --> 29:49.110
you didn't once think, "What
if Jack was telling the truth?"

29:51.880 --> 29:53.600
- No.
- Well, I did.

29:55.080 --> 29:56.920
I do. I think about it all the time.

29:58.120 --> 30:01.270
What if Jack was telling the
truth? What if he was innocent?

30:01.320 --> 30:04.440
- What if he had an alibi? What
if Dr Calgary... - Was lying.

30:05.680 --> 30:07.350
Leave it.

30:07.400 --> 30:10.270
You going on won't change
anything or bring anyone back.

30:10.320 --> 30:13.150
Tina! It's about time. I'm beside myself.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.790
We need help with the tables.

30:15.840 --> 30:18.470
Can you make sure they all
have the little lamps on them?

30:18.520 --> 30:19.960
Poor Tina.

30:21.280 --> 30:24.400
That's why I hide up here,
so they can't make me help.

30:28.320 --> 30:29.360
Where are you going?

30:30.480 --> 30:33.110
- Get some cigarettes.
- There's cigarettes in the store cupboard.

30:33.160 --> 30:34.670
Not the ones I like.

30:53.800 --> 30:55.950
I'm not cross, Hester.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.630
- You're not?
- It's Christmas Eve.

30:58.680 --> 31:00.320
How can I be cross?

31:08.680 --> 31:11.150
Well, of course, I saw
through him immediately.

31:11.200 --> 31:13.190
If you're going to pretend to be a doctor,

31:13.240 --> 31:14.950
don't dress as a caricature of one.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.560
A tweed suit and winter brogues
in July? It's ridiculous.

31:20.800 --> 31:23.390
- What did he say?
- Oh, the usual.

31:23.440 --> 31:25.160
Daddy dealt with him.

31:26.160 --> 31:29.510
Look at her, pointing at
flowers as if she's the Queen.

31:29.560 --> 31:32.230
You know, I thought
Mickey might help for once

31:32.280 --> 31:34.510
but he only cares about himself.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.910
Is her dress really white?

31:36.960 --> 31:40.430
- Ivory.
- Ivory! It's the same as white!

31:40.480 --> 31:42.670
This is unbearable!

31:42.720 --> 31:44.070
How can you go along with it?

31:44.120 --> 31:46.870
Bending over backwards
to be her new best friend.

31:46.920 --> 31:50.030
Why doesn't it kill you like it kills me?

31:50.080 --> 31:51.240
Because it doesn't.

31:52.800 --> 31:54.350
Well...

31:54.400 --> 31:55.760
I was the first.

31:57.160 --> 31:58.880
I loved Mother longest.

32:00.120 --> 32:02.640
- Mother... - Always pulling
at me! It's intolerable.

32:07.320 --> 32:08.840
It's different for you.

32:10.880 --> 32:12.110
It's not different for me.

32:12.160 --> 32:13.960
You think you were the favourite...

32:15.680 --> 32:17.120
.. but you weren't.

32:19.280 --> 32:21.120
Mother just felt sorry for you.

32:28.800 --> 32:30.720
Filth! Filth! Filth!

34:07.160 --> 34:09.790
'.. Against fire and radioactive fallout.

34:09.840 --> 34:11.949
And if you don't have one of those,

34:12.000 --> 34:15.230
then simply place a door
against a wall inside your house

34:15.280 --> 34:18.270
as an extra precaution for
yourself and your family

34:18.320 --> 34:21.870
until the police or Civil
Defence Corps arrive

34:21.920 --> 34:23.790
to tell you the danger is passed.

34:23.840 --> 34:25.790
If you are outside,

34:25.840 --> 34:28.070
then simply lie down.

34:28.120 --> 34:29.949
It is inadvisable to smoke,

34:30.000 --> 34:32.550
so keep your cigarettes in your pocket

34:32.600 --> 34:34.989
until you hear the all-clear siren.

34:35.040 --> 34:36.630
I want to remind everyone

34:36.679 --> 34:38.710
that although Great
Britain does face a threat

34:38.760 --> 34:41.190
from unscrupulous foreign powers...

34:55.000 --> 34:56.679
Sh. No, no, no.

35:12.200 --> 35:13.520
Who are you?

35:15.040 --> 35:17.510
Arthur Calgary, Dr Arthur Calgary.

35:17.560 --> 35:19.800
Well, you don't have
anything that proves it.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.240
No.

35:23.640 --> 35:25.080
How did you do that?

35:26.600 --> 35:31.480
I got brambles caught in my
trousers. The thorns, they...

35:33.440 --> 35:36.670
Tell me the story, the
one you told my dad.

35:36.720 --> 35:38.960
- It's not a story.
- Tell it anyway.

35:40.600 --> 35:43.110
- I was driving.
- What sort of car?

35:43.160 --> 35:45.350
- I don't really know about cars.
- Describe it.

35:45.400 --> 35:47.270
- I don't...
- Big?

35:47.320 --> 35:49.110
Small?

35:49.160 --> 35:51.070
Big, I suppose.

35:51.120 --> 35:52.160
You suppose?

35:53.240 --> 35:55.150
Where is it now?

35:55.200 --> 35:56.700
Because you didn't drive here.

35:58.240 --> 35:59.720
I don't have it any more.

36:02.240 --> 36:03.560
Go on.

36:05.120 --> 36:07.830
- I was driving...
- In the car that you don't know

36:07.880 --> 36:09.550
whether it was big or small?

36:09.600 --> 36:11.390
- Yes.
- That you don't have any more?

36:11.440 --> 36:14.840
- Driving on the road that goes past your house.
- How fast were you going?

36:16.080 --> 36:17.350
Quite slowly.

36:22.600 --> 36:24.030
Go on.

36:24.080 --> 36:26.790
Driving on the road
that goes past your house

36:26.840 --> 36:28.550
and this man stepped out into the road

36:28.600 --> 36:30.310
and put his hands up to ask for a lift.

36:30.360 --> 36:33.110
I stopped and gave him a
lift -- your brother, Jack.

36:33.160 --> 36:36.830
And we drove on and I dropped
him off outside a pub.

36:36.880 --> 36:40.080
I asked him for the time
and I went on my way.

36:44.240 --> 36:47.270
How come you don't have
anything that proves who you are?

36:47.320 --> 36:49.440
You're a driver. Where's your licence?

36:51.000 --> 36:52.440
I don't know.

36:53.440 --> 36:55.350
Did you lose it?

36:55.400 --> 36:57.080
In the Arctic?

36:58.680 --> 37:00.280
I might have done.

37:01.280 --> 37:03.200
Did it get eaten by a penguin?

37:04.720 --> 37:06.110
Penguins don't live in the Arctic,

37:06.160 --> 37:08.070
they live in the southern hemisphere.

37:12.720 --> 37:16.070
- Don't take the piss out of me.
- I'm not, I'm just pointing out a fact.

37:16.120 --> 37:18.350
I need you to do something.

37:18.400 --> 37:20.000
I need you to go.

37:21.200 --> 37:24.720
Because we've had enough of people
like you, we've really had enough.

37:26.200 --> 37:27.720
It's important you get that.

37:29.960 --> 37:32.590
Don't be here tomorrow.

37:32.640 --> 37:34.710
And don't go talking to
anyone else around here.

37:34.760 --> 37:36.000
Remember...

37:37.520 --> 37:39.120
.. I can get in.

38:15.800 --> 38:17.560
You can't go out.

38:23.200 --> 38:24.240
Darling...

38:26.680 --> 38:30.990
.. an evening spent in the
company of your father's friends

38:31.040 --> 38:33.990
and their bloated-pig wives

38:34.040 --> 38:36.030
braying over my head

38:36.080 --> 38:39.560
while my face is at crotch level...

38:41.440 --> 38:42.840
Not my idea of fun.

38:44.200 --> 38:47.840
I'm just going to go out and have
a quiet supper in town, all right?

38:50.040 --> 38:51.280
Oh.

39:06.480 --> 39:07.920
Ah, yes.

39:11.240 --> 39:13.760
Now, you won't drink too much, will you?

39:21.680 --> 39:23.600
You look very pretty.

39:26.640 --> 39:29.430
Don't let any of the men
flirt with you, will you?

39:31.120 --> 39:33.080
I'll see you later.

39:39.680 --> 39:42.760
Hm. Hm, hm, hm.

39:56.480 --> 39:58.280
Oh!

40:07.760 --> 40:10.390
I'm honestly not trying to
take your mother's place, Mary.

40:10.440 --> 40:13.230
I'd like us to be friends.

40:13.280 --> 40:16.710
We could have shopping trips, lunches.

40:16.760 --> 40:18.000
Just us girls.

40:21.600 --> 40:23.280
I don't want to be your friend.

40:24.720 --> 40:28.030
And as for taking my poor mother's place,

40:28.080 --> 40:30.120
with your elocution lessons and...

40:31.320 --> 40:33.030
.. your padded brassieres,

40:33.080 --> 40:35.240
you don't have a chance.

40:39.320 --> 40:44.080
Well, look at you, playing the
adoring, heartbroken daughter.

40:46.040 --> 40:47.640
"My poor mother."

40:51.400 --> 40:55.440
The thing is, no-one
hated her more than you.

41:09.160 --> 41:11.840
- Well, it looks like real gold.
- Shut up.

41:16.240 --> 41:18.600
Here she comes, Mother Superior.

41:21.760 --> 41:23.550
Thank you.

41:23.600 --> 41:25.470
What are you doing?

41:25.520 --> 41:27.430
You've got guests.

41:27.480 --> 41:30.230
It's just that it's my last evening
here, so I thought I'd just...

41:30.280 --> 41:32.910
You need to change into your
going-away outfit while your husband

41:32.960 --> 41:34.990
is still sober enough to
walk you out of the house.

41:35.040 --> 41:38.140
What's the rush? Why can't she just
sit here with us if she wants to?

41:40.240 --> 41:41.750
Because it doesn't look right.

41:41.800 --> 41:44.560
And that's what matters,
is it, "looking right"?

41:45.640 --> 41:48.030
Look, it won't take me a moment to change.

41:48.080 --> 41:50.160
You are happy for me, Mother, aren't you?

41:51.560 --> 41:55.160
Such hot, little hands!
You'll mark my suit. Come on.

42:03.200 --> 42:04.560
Don't.

42:06.560 --> 42:08.360
One day...

42:11.440 --> 42:13.760
One day just to crack the shell.

42:15.240 --> 42:16.840
See if there's anything inside.

42:37.600 --> 42:39.000
Don't!

42:50.160 --> 42:51.460
We can't avoid each other.

42:52.920 --> 42:55.160
So, we should probably make an effort.

42:58.560 --> 43:00.080
Don't come back.

43:08.800 --> 43:10.320
I suppose we should.

43:20.680 --> 43:22.240
One tiny, little push.

43:26.520 --> 43:27.880
Go ahead.

43:48.080 --> 43:49.550
Ah.

43:49.600 --> 43:51.030
Doctor Calgary.

43:51.080 --> 43:53.230
I apologise for not
coming to find you myself

43:53.280 --> 43:56.710
but I'm not as good at
the stairs as I once was.

43:56.760 --> 43:58.150
We weren't introduced earlier.

43:58.200 --> 44:01.240
I am Flight Lieutenant Durrant,
but please call me Philip.

44:02.680 --> 44:04.310
- Arthur.
- Arthur.

44:04.360 --> 44:06.070
I'd like to buy you dinner.

44:06.120 --> 44:09.350
I thought that at least one person
in the family should be hospitable.

44:09.400 --> 44:10.600
What do you say?

44:12.600 --> 44:13.670
Thank you.

44:13.720 --> 44:15.240
Thank you, sir.

44:18.040 --> 44:19.630
It's funny, isn't it?

44:19.680 --> 44:24.320
How some murders fly right under
the radar and no-one really cares...

44:25.360 --> 44:28.590
.. and others make a lot of noise.

44:28.640 --> 44:30.070
Although let's face it,

44:30.120 --> 44:33.070
"Perfect mother beaten to
death by her adopted son"

44:33.120 --> 44:34.750
is a newspaper man's dream,

44:34.800 --> 44:39.350
really makes you sit up over
your toast and marmalade.

44:39.400 --> 44:42.710
Especially when the perfect
mother is an heiress.

44:42.760 --> 44:44.430
Jack was adopted?

44:44.480 --> 44:46.430
Yes, God, yes, they all are.

44:46.480 --> 44:50.390
Even the maid is from
some dismal foundling home,

44:50.440 --> 44:53.670
they couldn't have children of their own

44:53.720 --> 44:57.470
so they filled the house
with little unwanteds.

44:57.520 --> 45:01.000
Landed with their bums in the
butter with all that Argyll money.

45:02.560 --> 45:04.030
Not that I see any of it.

45:04.080 --> 45:07.000
They keep me on very short commons.

45:08.520 --> 45:11.230
Every man gets himself into a bit of debt,

45:11.280 --> 45:13.910
you'd think they'd be only
too happy to help a chap out.

45:13.960 --> 45:17.150
A flying ace, decorated,

45:17.200 --> 45:19.250
I'm a bloody hero.

45:19.800 --> 45:23.150
The whole world tilted
on my wing, I was...

45:28.000 --> 45:29.480
I was a god.

45:30.960 --> 45:32.200
Now...

45:33.480 --> 45:36.110
Now I piss in a bottle.

45:40.960 --> 45:42.440
Cheers.

45:44.160 --> 45:45.910
I tip them extra.

45:45.960 --> 45:47.150
Don't I?!

45:50.400 --> 45:52.150
Yes, I'd only got out of hospital

45:52.200 --> 45:54.310
the night before Rachel's sad demise.

45:54.360 --> 45:58.150
I wrote the car off on the
way back from the races.

45:58.200 --> 45:59.720
Broke my back.

46:01.320 --> 46:02.640
I'm sorry.

46:04.320 --> 46:05.560
So am I.

46:15.760 --> 46:18.150
Wonderful spread, Kirsten.

46:18.200 --> 46:21.360
- Thank you, Chief Constable.
- You always feed us so well.

46:23.720 --> 46:26.790
Things are bound to change
under the new Mrs Argyll,

46:26.840 --> 46:31.320
if it gets difficult, you just
let me know. I have Leo's ear.

46:32.920 --> 46:34.230
Difficult?

46:34.280 --> 46:37.670
I wouldn't like to see you get side-lined

46:37.720 --> 46:40.120
when you were so devoted to Rachel.

46:59.840 --> 47:03.120
So, what were you doing
in the Arctic, then?

47:05.120 --> 47:07.830
I'm not able to discuss my work.

47:07.880 --> 47:10.480
You were a military
man, you will understand.

47:12.440 --> 47:15.440
Official secrets, hm?

47:17.880 --> 47:19.710
Well, you're right to keep quiet,

47:19.760 --> 47:22.150
you never know who's listening these days

47:22.200 --> 47:24.750
and all after the same thing.

47:28.760 --> 47:31.070
Jack's brother came to see me.

47:31.120 --> 47:33.990
Mickey? And what did he want?

47:34.040 --> 47:38.150
He suggested that I
leave and not come back.

47:38.200 --> 47:40.910
How typically charming of him!

47:40.960 --> 47:42.000
And...

47:44.160 --> 47:47.030
.. are you going to go
away and never come back?

47:47.080 --> 47:48.710
I don't see what else I can do.

47:48.760 --> 47:50.830
Jack's dead.

47:50.880 --> 47:52.640
I can't do any good here.

47:54.120 --> 47:56.830
There is an awful lot of
good that you can do here.

47:56.880 --> 48:00.710
- What do you mean?
- You're going to stick around, Arthur.

48:00.760 --> 48:04.030
Tell your version of events and
let the rumour mill do the rest.

48:04.080 --> 48:06.550
A place like this, suspicions run riot.

48:06.600 --> 48:09.120
The whole bloody family are suspects.

48:10.440 --> 48:13.430
Which one of them's got
blood on their hands?

48:13.480 --> 48:15.240
So deliciously squalid.

48:49.480 --> 48:51.110
You're leaving, Jack.

48:51.160 --> 48:52.680
God almighty, Mother.

49:01.800 --> 49:04.350
Jack killed Rachel, all right.

49:04.400 --> 49:06.880
He was a nasty, little bastard.

49:08.520 --> 49:10.630
A demon seed.

49:10.680 --> 49:12.830
- But he didn't.
- Yes, he did. Of course, he did,

49:12.880 --> 49:15.270
His fingerprints were all
over the murder weapon,

49:15.320 --> 49:18.350
the whisky decanter, which weighed
a bloody tonne, I can assure you.

49:18.400 --> 49:20.550
No, no, no, he got what was coming to him.

49:20.600 --> 49:24.110
But people starting to think
that it might not have been him

49:24.160 --> 49:26.270
works very well for us.

49:26.320 --> 49:30.680
- What do you mean?
- Well, if a newspaper picks it up...

49:31.680 --> 49:33.910
.. lawyers get interested.

49:33.960 --> 49:36.470
I feed you all the information that I have

49:36.520 --> 49:38.310
and together we stir the pot.

49:38.360 --> 49:40.670
And if Leo Argyll wants you gone --

49:40.720 --> 49:42.470
and he bloody well will --

49:42.520 --> 49:44.110
he'll have to pay.

49:44.160 --> 49:45.870
And pay big.

49:45.920 --> 49:47.920
50-50 split.

49:49.920 --> 49:52.350
That's... That's extortion.

49:52.400 --> 49:54.790
I won't do that.

49:54.840 --> 49:56.630
I can't believe you'd
suggest such a thing,

49:56.680 --> 49:58.750
your own family, when they're grieving.

49:58.800 --> 50:02.150
If I tell a newspaper or a lawyer
anything, it'll be about you.

50:02.700 --> 50:04.560
- Sit down! - Let go of me! - Sit down.

50:07.720 --> 50:10.510
If you're a scientist doing
secret research in the Arctic,

50:10.560 --> 50:12.870
- then I'm a baboon's ball sack.
- That's where I've been!

50:12.920 --> 50:14.990
The sun doesn't set far
north in the midsummer,

50:15.040 --> 50:16.910
you'd have a bit of colour
in your face, but you,

50:16.960 --> 50:19.630
you look like a maggot, like you've
been living under a rotten log.

50:19.680 --> 50:21.870
And, to me, that says one
thing, you've been in prison.

50:21.920 --> 50:24.350
Yes, I'm right, aren't I?
Is that where you met Jack?

50:24.400 --> 50:25.710
- I gave him a lift.
- My arse!

50:25.760 --> 50:27.230
You're a conman. You've been inside,

50:27.280 --> 50:29.950
and one word from me will
have you sent straight back!

50:30.000 --> 50:31.790
Oh, Christ, you look terrified!

50:31.840 --> 50:34.150
What are you so scared about?

50:34.200 --> 50:37.680
He's attacking me! The war hero in
a wheelchair! He's attacking me!

50:46.200 --> 50:50.880
Dear friends, I would like
to say thank you to Gwenda...

50:52.320 --> 50:54.270
.. for agreeing to be my wife.

50:54.320 --> 50:55.830
No!

50:55.880 --> 50:58.910
- Which I think is happening
quite soon. - Stop!

51:00.720 --> 51:04.070
And I would like to say thank you...

51:04.120 --> 51:06.150
to my children...

51:06.200 --> 51:08.590
all grown up now...

51:08.640 --> 51:10.480
for giving us their blessing.

51:12.120 --> 51:13.630
(Smile.)

51:13.680 --> 51:16.030
Thank you for being here.

51:16.080 --> 51:18.230
You have been steadfast

51:18.280 --> 51:24.310
during the most appalling
ordeal any family could endure.

51:24.360 --> 51:30.920
And you have the gratitude of
myself and my children forever.

52:21.280 --> 52:22.840
Can I get a lift?

52:30.600 --> 52:32.080
Well?

52:33.800 --> 52:38.030
The toast I would like
to make is to Rachel.

52:38.080 --> 52:42.430
Wife, mother, a force of nature,

52:42.480 --> 52:44.200
a crusader for good.

52:51.840 --> 52:53.560
Let me go!

52:54.600 --> 52:55.720
Don't!

53:15.720 --> 53:19.510
Do you have the time? I'm
supposed to be there by nine.

53:19.560 --> 53:21.800
Yes, well, it's nearly
that now. So, you're late.

53:56.960 --> 53:59.640
There. There, there.
Sh, sh. There, there...

54:47.400 --> 54:49.270
Rachel.

54:49.320 --> 54:50.960
To Rachel.

54:53.360 --> 54:55.710
We've been through hell. You
don't know what that's like!

54:55.760 --> 54:57.400
I know what hell is like.

54:59.040 --> 55:00.480
Leave me alone!

55:03.000 --> 55:06.150
- Why don't you believe me? I'm
telling you the truth! - Shut up!

55:06.200 --> 55:08.700
I could have killed her
that night for what she did.

55:10.720 --> 55:12.190
Why are you so cruel to me?

55:12.240 --> 55:15.000
It's like kicking a
whipped dog. It's easy.

55:17.400 --> 55:21.600
Jack was innocent, and your
wife's killer is still free.

55:30.400 --> 55:32.350
Do you really not know what you've done?

55:32.400 --> 55:33.990
The bomb you've just dropped?

55:34.040 --> 55:36.000
A bit too old for you, though, aren't I?

55:38.360 --> 55:40.120
You won't break me, Jack.

55:44.640 --> 55:46.200
They're all in on it.

55:48.600 --> 55:52.160
If Jack didn't kill Mother, then who did?

55:58.440 --> 55:59.880
Of course it's you.
