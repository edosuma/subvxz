WEBVTT

00:02.403 --> 00:03.703
Oh, okay.

00:03.771 --> 00:06.507
Here's one of the first things
your Uncle Charlie wrote.

00:06.574 --> 00:07.808
( plays piano )

00:07.875 --> 00:13.414
* Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles... *

00:14.948 --> 00:17.085
Eh? What do you think?

00:17.151 --> 00:20.321
Must have been
before my time.

00:22.123 --> 00:24.358
Okay, we're done here.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.195
Hey, hey, hey.

00:27.261 --> 00:29.029
Don't put your
juice box on the piano.

00:29.097 --> 00:30.398
It leaves a ring.

00:30.464 --> 00:33.201
How could a box leave a ring?

00:34.268 --> 00:35.736
Got to run
to the grocery store.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.305
I'm going to need somebody
to fold these clothes.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.806
I don't know
if the grocery store

00:38.872 --> 00:41.175
is the first place
I'd go for that, but good luck.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.010
Oh, oh, remember.

00:43.077 --> 00:44.112
You're being punished.

00:44.178 --> 00:46.347
So no TV, no computer,
no Gameboy.

00:46.414 --> 00:48.015
Charlie, I need you
to be my eyes and ears.

00:48.082 --> 00:51.519
Okay, but you have to be
my liver and prostate.

00:52.953 --> 00:55.089
Whoa, whose is this?

00:57.091 --> 00:58.126
Uh, Charlie, you want
to field that one?

00:58.192 --> 00:59.627
No problem.

00:59.693 --> 01:03.097
Jake, sometimes when you have
a casual, sexual relationship...

01:03.164 --> 01:04.665
All right, all right.

01:06.334 --> 01:08.869
Jake, we take in
strangers' laundry

01:08.936 --> 01:10.304
because we're poor.

01:12.005 --> 01:13.307
I'll be back in an hour.

01:13.374 --> 01:15.176
Start folding. No TV.

01:18.979 --> 01:20.414
What'd you get busted for?

01:20.481 --> 01:22.116
Painted my room at Mom's house.

01:22.183 --> 01:23.151
What's wrong with that?

01:23.217 --> 01:25.253
I'm ten years old.

01:26.987 --> 01:30.558
Hey, how about
a little sock golf?

01:30.624 --> 01:31.659
What's that?

01:31.725 --> 01:33.861
Okay, here's how it works.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.430
The living room
is a dog leg par four.

01:36.497 --> 01:40.000
That means you have to get your
sock into the kitchen sink

01:40.067 --> 01:41.969
in four strokes or less.

01:42.035 --> 01:43.304
Okay.

01:43.371 --> 01:44.938
Play for a quarter
a hole.

01:45.005 --> 01:47.375
Your handicap's obvious.

01:47.441 --> 01:50.844
You're short and you've never
heard of the Ninja Turtles.

01:50.911 --> 01:52.112
All right,

01:52.180 --> 01:54.748
keep your knees bent,
your arms straight

01:54.815 --> 01:56.650
and swing easy.

02:00.020 --> 02:01.689
Oh, man.

02:01.755 --> 02:02.690
I'm being hustled.

02:02.756 --> 02:04.692
We can play for less
if you want.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.260
Don't get cocky.

02:06.327 --> 02:10.130
There's 17 more holes.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:19.273 --> 02:20.708
( British accent ):
The 18th hole.

02:20.774 --> 02:21.775
All square.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.377
The defending champion

02:23.444 --> 02:25.946
looks to have
an easy tap in for a birdie,

02:26.013 --> 02:28.115
as the gallery waits
breathlessly

02:28.182 --> 02:30.150
for the rookie to respond.

02:30.218 --> 02:32.586
Would you please
stop talking?

02:34.188 --> 02:36.657
Tempers flare
as the pressure mounts.

02:41.995 --> 02:42.930
Oh, yeah!

02:42.996 --> 02:44.232
It's unbelievable.

02:44.298 --> 02:45.866
And eagle on the 18th.

02:45.933 --> 02:48.936
This has never happened before
in the history of sock golf.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.404
Little help here.

02:50.471 --> 02:52.340
Fans are coming out
of the gallery

02:52.406 --> 02:54.608
with sacks of groceries
for the young phenom.

02:54.675 --> 02:55.643
What's going on?

02:55.709 --> 02:57.778
I won.
I beat Uncle Charlie.

02:57.845 --> 02:58.946
Excuse me.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.581
Didn't I ask you
to fold the laundry?

03:00.648 --> 03:01.849
Laundry?

03:01.915 --> 03:03.417
Are you barking mad?

03:03.484 --> 03:06.854
The child just won
the coveted Palmolive Cup.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.923
* I won, you lose,
I won... *

03:09.990 --> 03:11.759
Charlie...

03:11.825 --> 03:14.762
when I ask Jake to do something,
I need you to help me make sure

03:14.828 --> 03:15.763
that he does it.

03:15.829 --> 03:16.930
I'm trying to teach him

03:16.997 --> 03:17.931
responsibility.

03:17.998 --> 03:19.567
This sock is soaking wet.

03:19.633 --> 03:22.336
Yeah, I chipped into
the water hazard

03:22.403 --> 03:24.572
on the ninth and
the lid was open.

03:24.638 --> 03:26.073
So, this is toilet water.

03:26.139 --> 03:28.409
At least.

03:34.815 --> 03:35.883
All right,

03:35.949 --> 03:38.185
I put Jake to bed,
I folded the laundry,

03:38.252 --> 03:39.620
I put the groceries
away...

03:39.687 --> 03:41.655
The guilt thing doesn't
work on me, Alan.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.724
Yeah, well, it's all I got.

03:43.791 --> 03:45.158
I'll be back
in a little while.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.594
Where are you going?

03:46.660 --> 03:48.629
Oh, I have to bring
the garbage cans back in.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.498
Today wasn't garbage day.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.333
Oh, no, not here. At Judith's.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.635
At Judith's?

03:54.702 --> 03:57.638
Alan, your wife threw you out.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.573
Yeah, well, that doesn't mean
she doesn't need me.

03:59.640 --> 04:02.943
Yeah, it kind of does.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.512
Well, look, we're still married.

04:04.578 --> 04:05.946
It's still my house,

04:06.013 --> 04:09.016
and she still counts on me
to do a few chores.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.518
It's good.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.754
It leaves the door open
for, you know, reconciliation.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.155
I see.

04:15.222 --> 04:19.993
So, how do you lift those
garbage cans without a spine?

04:24.031 --> 04:25.599
They're on wheels.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.410
What are you watching?

04:36.477 --> 04:38.946
I'm watching a movie.

04:39.012 --> 04:41.615
And you're not supposed
to be watching anything.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.317
Oh, yeah.

04:43.384 --> 04:45.953
Is that guy a good guy
or a bad guy?

04:46.019 --> 04:47.488
Good guy.

04:47.555 --> 04:50.023
And you're not supposed
to be watching TV.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.325
I know.

04:54.995 --> 04:57.164
Is that his girlfriend?

04:57.230 --> 04:58.499
Ex-girlfriend.

04:58.566 --> 05:00.033
But he still loves her, right?

05:00.100 --> 05:03.504
I'm not going to walk you
through the whole movie.

05:04.405 --> 05:06.239
I think so.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.941
Go to bed, Jake.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.977
Okay.

05:13.246 --> 05:14.515
Who's that guy?

05:14.582 --> 05:15.849
That's the guy
he was in jail with

05:15.916 --> 05:17.885
and told him
where the money was hidden.

05:17.951 --> 05:20.220
Oh, right.

05:20.287 --> 05:21.755
Hey, you're being punished.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.056
No TV.

05:23.123 --> 05:24.758
I know.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.431
( door opening )

05:32.366 --> 05:34.234
What the hell is going on?

05:34.301 --> 05:36.804
BOTH:
Shh.

05:36.870 --> 05:37.938
Jake.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.707
Good night.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.077
Hey,
I'm watching that.

05:44.144 --> 05:46.213
What part of "no TV"
didn't you understand?

05:46.279 --> 05:48.882
I'm allowed to watch TV.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.350
I mean Jake.

05:50.418 --> 05:51.619
I said, "No TV."
He said, "Okay."

05:51.685 --> 05:53.421
I said, "Go to bed."
He said, "Okay."

05:53.487 --> 05:54.688
What do you want from me?

05:54.755 --> 05:56.356
Charlie, he's taking
advantage of you

05:56.424 --> 05:57.891
because he knows
you won't follow through.

05:57.958 --> 06:01.028
Well he obviously knows me
better than you do.

06:01.094 --> 06:02.796
Okay, look,
if this is going to work out

06:02.863 --> 06:05.399
with Jake living here part-time,
you have to be an adult.

06:05.466 --> 06:06.634
You have to impose discipline.

06:06.700 --> 06:07.968
Yeah, fine, whatever.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.136
Give me back the remote.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.638
No, no, you're
not listening to me.

06:10.704 --> 06:11.905
You need to be firm.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.807
Okay.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.876
Go to your room.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.144
Yes, like that.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.446
I mean it.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.614
Give me the remote
and go to your room.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.416
That's very funny. Ha-ha.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.584
I'm serious.
Get out of here.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.586
I will kick your ass.

06:34.194 --> 06:35.963
Oh, man.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.846
Shoo.

07:00.220 --> 07:04.357
( "Road Runner" plays )

07:04.424 --> 07:06.226
Jake.

07:06.293 --> 07:07.528
( firmer ):
Jake.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.497
It was on when I came in.

07:12.065 --> 07:14.201
Yeah, right.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.770
What did I tell you about
leaving juice boxes on my piano?

07:16.837 --> 07:19.907
How do you know it's mine?

07:19.973 --> 07:21.408
Oh, come on.

07:21.475 --> 07:26.013
Who else around here drinks
"Transylvania Goofy Juice"?

07:26.079 --> 07:28.482
Good point.

07:28.549 --> 07:29.950
And another thing,

07:30.017 --> 07:32.486
were you on the deck
feeding the seagulls again?

07:32.553 --> 07:34.922
Sorry, I forgot.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.357
Okay.

07:37.424 --> 07:38.992
We need to talk.

07:40.193 --> 07:41.895
Love you, Uncle Charlie.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.231
Look, we don't feed
the seagulls

07:44.297 --> 07:46.534
because you
can't get rid of them.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.201
And we don't leave
the doors and windows open

07:48.268 --> 07:50.871
because we get all kinds of bugs
and crap flying in the house.

07:50.938 --> 07:51.872
Okay.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.641
No, no, no,
don't just say, "Okay."

07:53.707 --> 07:55.843
This is not the grown-up
telling the kid what to do.

07:55.909 --> 07:58.278
This is just two guys agreeing
how to live together.

07:58.345 --> 07:59.479
Are we cool?

07:59.547 --> 08:01.882
Yeah, cool.

08:01.949 --> 08:02.950
Hey.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.217
What's going on?

08:04.284 --> 08:05.218
Nothing.

08:05.285 --> 08:06.720
Was he watching TV?

08:06.787 --> 08:07.755
No.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.559
Jake, I have to run

08:11.625 --> 08:12.693
a quick errand,

08:12.760 --> 08:14.227
so why don't you
wash and dress

08:14.294 --> 08:15.596
and when I get back
we'll do something fun.

08:15.663 --> 08:17.030
Can we watch TV?

08:17.097 --> 08:18.065
Go.

08:20.768 --> 08:22.069
Where are you off to?

08:22.135 --> 08:25.272
Uh, the, uh, uh...
grocery store.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.546
You're going to Judith's,
aren't you?

08:32.613 --> 08:33.881
( scoffs )

08:33.947 --> 08:35.616
No.

08:35.683 --> 08:39.452
Then where are you going?

08:39.519 --> 08:42.022
Judith's.

08:42.089 --> 08:43.657
Oh, Alan.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.192
I have to. I have to.

08:45.258 --> 08:46.359
The-the-the-timer

08:46.426 --> 08:47.895
on the sprinkler system
is broken

08:47.961 --> 08:50.063
and the flower beds
are getting flooded,

08:50.130 --> 08:52.332
and I love her
and I want her back.

08:52.399 --> 08:55.135
Oh, buddy, I feel for you.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.203
Well, thank you.

08:56.269 --> 08:59.773
Unfortunately,
the feeling is nausea.

08:59.840 --> 09:03.076
Great, great.
I'll see you later.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.579
Alan, you've been making the
same mistake your whole life.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.014
Being the good boy,

09:07.080 --> 09:09.149
fixing everything
so everybody would love you.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.818
It didn't work with Mom,

09:10.884 --> 09:13.587
didn't work with either of
the women you went out with.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.055
And it's not going to work
with your wife.

09:15.122 --> 09:17.858
Charlie, you know nothing
about commitment

09:17.925 --> 09:20.327
and responsibility
to a relationship.

09:20.393 --> 09:23.496
Granted, but I do know
when a woman's using me.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.799
And by that I mean
not in a fun way.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.300
Well, you can rest easy,

09:27.367 --> 09:29.036
because no one is using me.

09:32.372 --> 09:34.708
And did you mean
that I only dated two women

09:34.775 --> 09:35.909
including Judith?

09:35.976 --> 09:37.244
Because,

09:37.310 --> 09:39.713
because if you did,
I have two words for you.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.016
Maxine Chernakoff.

09:50.924 --> 09:51.992
Ya!

09:56.463 --> 09:58.031
Did you fix it?

09:58.098 --> 09:59.900
Not quite.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.869
Doesn't seem like
you're changing anything.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.838
Well, no, well, sometimes
change happens, Judith,

10:04.905 --> 10:06.139
and you can't see it.

10:07.675 --> 10:08.709
Okay, fine.

10:08.776 --> 10:09.743
When you're done fixing this,

10:09.810 --> 10:10.944
would you come inside

10:11.011 --> 10:12.612
and take a look
at the garbage disposal?

10:12.680 --> 10:15.082
Sure.
Thank you.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.017
Wait, no.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.553
What?

10:20.620 --> 10:21.955
No, I-I won't come inside

10:22.022 --> 10:24.257
and look at
the garbage disposal.

10:24.324 --> 10:27.661
Why not?

10:27.728 --> 10:30.230
I know when I'm being used,
Judith,

10:30.297 --> 10:31.865
and not in a fun way.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.701
What are you talking about?

10:33.767 --> 10:34.902
Who are we kidding?

10:34.968 --> 10:36.704
The marriage is over.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.005
You're just afraid
to move on,

10:38.071 --> 10:39.940
so you keep dragging
me over here,

10:40.007 --> 10:42.776
and I'm afraid to move on,
so I keep coming.

10:45.679 --> 10:46.714
Good-bye, Judith.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.281
You're free. I...

10:48.348 --> 10:52.853
I hope you find whatever it is
you're looking for.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.433
Jake?

11:06.499 --> 11:07.801
What you got there?

11:07.868 --> 11:09.903
Just a little bread.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.539
Please tell me you're not
feeding the seagulls again.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.742
( seagull screeching )

11:15.809 --> 11:17.544
Okay.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.346
Oh, man, did you let another one

11:19.412 --> 11:22.015
of those big, flappy bastards
in the house?

11:22.082 --> 11:24.818
You have to put a dollar
in the swear jar.

11:24.885 --> 11:25.919
You said "bastards."

11:25.986 --> 11:28.756
Smart-- poke the bear.

11:28.822 --> 11:31.391
I'm telling you, Jake,
this is the last ti...

11:31.458 --> 11:35.295
( seagulls crying )

11:35.362 --> 11:37.297
Yikes.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.604
I'm really sorry,
Uncle Charlie.

11:44.671 --> 11:46.206
I don't want to talk
to you right now.

11:46.273 --> 11:48.041
Hello, uh, do you
have a department

11:48.108 --> 11:52.445
of animal control
or bird abatement?

11:52.512 --> 11:55.248
I have a seagull problem.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.717
Sea-gull.

11:57.785 --> 11:59.552
Thank you. I'll hold.

11:59.619 --> 12:01.789
I didn't know
there'd be so many.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.523
I told you,
don't feed the damn things.

12:03.590 --> 12:06.126
I told you,
don't leave the windows open.

12:06.193 --> 12:08.228
Yeah, hi, uh-uh,
who is this?

12:08.295 --> 12:11.264
Phyllis Siegal.

12:18.438 --> 12:19.873
No, no, Phyllis,

12:19.940 --> 12:23.110
I-I wanted to talk to somebody
about seagulls.

12:23.176 --> 12:26.446
I got a flock of seagulls
in my house.

12:26.513 --> 12:29.917
No, I don't know
whatever happened to them.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.885
I'm really sorry.

12:31.952 --> 12:34.354
We had an agreement, Jake,
and you broke it.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.389
Look, uh, I-I need somebody

12:36.456 --> 12:39.426
who can come over
with a net or something.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.661
Sure. I'll hold.

12:41.728 --> 12:44.264
Hello? Who is this?

12:44.331 --> 12:46.266
Annette.

12:48.001 --> 12:51.038
Look, I got a room
filled with seagulls.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.439
No-no-no-no-no...

12:54.641 --> 12:55.675
Hi, Phyllis.

12:55.742 --> 12:57.310
Hey.

12:57.377 --> 12:58.745
Good-bye, Phyllis.

12:58.812 --> 13:00.047
Good news.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.314
Really?

13:01.381 --> 13:02.816
Come tell me
in Jake's room.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.317
What did he do?

13:04.384 --> 13:05.785
He didn't paint
anything, did he?

13:05.853 --> 13:08.922
I want you
to be surprised.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.892
You will never
guess what happened

13:11.959 --> 13:13.894
while I was at Judith's.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.762
Neither will you.

13:15.829 --> 13:18.231
( gulls squawking )

13:18.298 --> 13:19.166
Oh, my God!

13:19.232 --> 13:22.870
So what's your good news?

13:22.936 --> 13:24.704
Open the door!

13:24.771 --> 13:26.206
Your kid got 'em in there.

13:26.273 --> 13:27.007
You get 'em out.

13:27.074 --> 13:28.008
( banging door )

13:28.075 --> 13:31.912
Open... this door!

13:35.182 --> 13:39.186
That was not
funny, Charlie.

13:39.252 --> 13:42.122
Depends on what side of the door
you were on.

13:43.756 --> 13:45.525
Look, I-I'm really sorry
about the birds,

13:45.592 --> 13:47.861
but I'm sure they'll leave
as soon as they get hungry.

13:47.928 --> 13:50.397
That's what I thought about you.

13:50.463 --> 13:51.798
Well, you know what--
Jake and I may be

13:51.865 --> 13:52.832
out of here sooner
than you think.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.067
What do you mean?

13:54.134 --> 13:56.803
At Judith's,
there was kissing.

13:56.870 --> 13:58.338
Mutual kissing.

13:58.405 --> 14:00.607
Unprompted, but reciprocated
by yours truly.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.709
Wow.
Mm.

14:02.775 --> 14:04.344
And was it as boring
as it sounds?

14:05.412 --> 14:06.880
Charlie, Charlie,
she kissed me,

14:06.947 --> 14:08.348
and this was not
the kiss of a woman

14:08.415 --> 14:10.850
who just wanted
her garbage disposal
unclogged.

14:12.252 --> 14:15.122
Well, you know her plumbing
better than I do.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.689
You know what
I'm going to do?

14:16.756 --> 14:18.691
I'm going to let
her come to me.

14:18.758 --> 14:20.360
You know, be detached.

14:20.427 --> 14:21.328
Play it cool.

14:21.394 --> 14:24.197
Yeah, that's
your home run swing.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.401
Hey, Uncle Charlie,
want to play some sock golf?

14:28.468 --> 14:29.836
No, thanks.

14:29.903 --> 14:30.870
JAKE:
Where you going?

14:30.938 --> 14:32.472
CHARLIE:
Going for a drive.

14:32.539 --> 14:35.142
Can I come?
Nope.

14:38.078 --> 14:40.880
I don't think
Uncle Charlie likes me anymore.

14:40.948 --> 14:42.049
Don't be silly.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.650
He-he's just a little upset

14:43.716 --> 14:46.086
about the 30, 40 screaming,
crapping birds in his house.

14:46.153 --> 14:47.988
Why don't you, uh...

14:48.055 --> 14:50.623
Why don't you write him
a note and tell him
how sorry you are.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.192
Okay.

14:52.259 --> 14:55.095
Don't worry. He'll come around.

14:55.162 --> 14:58.331
Sooner or later,
everybody comes around.

14:59.566 --> 15:02.035
You just have to give 'em
a little time...

15:02.102 --> 15:05.872
and a little space.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.907
Hello, Judith?

15:12.612 --> 15:14.681
What's in the bucket?

15:14.747 --> 15:16.683
Chum.

15:17.617 --> 15:18.685
What?

15:18.751 --> 15:19.987
Bait.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.354
I went down to
the bait shop

15:21.421 --> 15:23.556
and asked them what
seagulls liked to eat.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.292
We're keeping them?

15:25.358 --> 15:28.361
No. We're going to throw
the bait out the window

15:28.428 --> 15:30.030
to lure the birds
out of the house.

15:30.097 --> 15:31.831
Oh, that-that's pretty clever.

15:31.898 --> 15:33.500
Yeah, it's a variation

15:33.566 --> 15:36.236
on something I do
with women and tennis bracelets.

15:38.605 --> 15:41.574
Hey, Uncle Charlie,
I made this for you.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.581
Thanks.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.750
I made it myself.

15:50.817 --> 15:52.952
I see that.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.288
What you doing?

15:55.355 --> 15:56.423
Getting rid of the birds.

15:56.489 --> 15:57.557
Can I help?

15:57.624 --> 16:00.293
Nope.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.729
Uh, Jake, why don't you go out
and play on the deck, okay?

16:02.795 --> 16:04.564
Okay.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.436
What is wrong with you?

16:09.502 --> 16:11.204
He worked really
hard on that card.

16:11.271 --> 16:12.239
You barely looked at it.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.540
What do you want
from me, Alan?

16:13.606 --> 16:15.875
Well, he's dying
for you to forgive him.

16:15.942 --> 16:18.045
Fine. I forgive him.

16:18.111 --> 16:20.047
Now, are you going
to help me or not?

16:20.113 --> 16:23.583
I got a serious problem here.

16:23.650 --> 16:26.019
Really? 'Cause you look
like you have it all together.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.689
Okay, here's the deal.

16:30.757 --> 16:32.125
We go in there

16:32.192 --> 16:34.094
and start throwing this stuff
out the windows.

16:34.161 --> 16:35.495
When the last bird's out,

16:35.562 --> 16:38.131
we close the window
and get on with our lives.

16:39.032 --> 16:40.567
You ready?

16:41.768 --> 16:43.370
Sure.

16:43.436 --> 16:46.039
You know, if they love
this bait so much,

16:46.106 --> 16:48.208
why would they
even wait for...

16:48.275 --> 16:50.710
( gulls squawking )
( screaming )

17:01.154 --> 17:03.823
It's almost like somebody
tipped 'em off.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.425
Got any other bright ideas?

17:05.492 --> 17:06.492
Yeah.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.595
I'm going to get
a dry wall guy in there

17:08.661 --> 17:09.695
and seal off that room.

17:11.464 --> 17:12.699
Very funny.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.733
I'm not kidding.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.736
That room is dead to me.

17:18.505 --> 17:20.207
It's either that
or sell the house.

17:20.272 --> 17:21.374
I'll put it
on the market

17:21.441 --> 17:24.344
as a two-bedroom-plus aviary.

17:24.411 --> 17:26.746
Everybody loves an aviary.

17:27.847 --> 17:28.881
What about Jake?

17:28.948 --> 17:30.183
You going to put him
on the market,

17:30.250 --> 17:32.051
or just wall him off?

17:32.119 --> 17:33.620
Hey, I tried
with that kid, Alan.

17:33.686 --> 17:36.289
He-he-he says one thing and then
he goes and does another.

17:36.356 --> 17:38.991
He's ten. He's got the attention
span of a hummingbird.

17:39.058 --> 17:42.629
Well, then, what am I supposed
to do when he ignores me?

17:42.695 --> 17:44.131
You punish him--
you-you take away his computer,

17:44.197 --> 17:45.598
his-his TV, his toys.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.534
Well, you already took away
all the good stuff.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.370
What am I supposed to take
away-- his bronchial inhaler?

17:50.437 --> 17:51.771
You know what I'm saying,
Charlie.

17:51.838 --> 17:54.241
You just... you don't...
take away your love.

18:41.654 --> 18:42.555
Hi, uh,

18:42.622 --> 18:43.556
I tried calling,

18:43.623 --> 18:44.924
but I kept getting
your machine,

18:44.991 --> 18:46.159
so I thought I'd
bring this over.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.594
What is it?

18:47.660 --> 18:49.662
Oh, it's my master file
of, uh, handymen,

18:49.729 --> 18:52.365
plumbers, electricians,
maintenance schedules,

18:52.432 --> 18:55.034
warranties, authorized
repair centers, um...

18:55.101 --> 18:56.669
et cetera.

18:56.736 --> 18:59.706
Okay, well, uh,
you're on your own.

18:59.772 --> 19:00.707
Got to run.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.709
Alan, wait.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.747
Yes?

19:07.814 --> 19:09.516
About that kiss...

19:09.582 --> 19:11.184
Ah.

19:11.251 --> 19:13.586
When you said
we should move on,

19:13.653 --> 19:14.821
I got scared,

19:14.887 --> 19:16.356
and, uh...

19:16.423 --> 19:18.425
Alan, I kissed you
out of fear.

19:18.491 --> 19:21.160
Hey, it still counts.

19:21.228 --> 19:22.729
Alan, you were right.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.497
We have to move on.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.234
Okay.

19:28.134 --> 19:30.237
Alan, wait.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.675
Yes?

19:35.742 --> 19:38.245
The garbage disposal's still
making that horrible noise.

19:38.311 --> 19:40.780
Well, I keep telling you
not to put bones in it.

19:40.847 --> 19:41.814
I didn't.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.716
The sink trap does
not lie, Judith.

19:46.118 --> 19:48.688
This is so cool,
Uncle Charlie.

19:48.755 --> 19:51.224
Yeah, well, I
was kind of hard
on you, and I...

19:51.291 --> 19:52.692
I wanted to make it up.

19:52.759 --> 19:55.194
So you're not still mad
about the seagulls?

19:55.262 --> 19:56.529
Oh, I'm still mad.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.631
I just figured out a better way
to deal with it.

19:58.698 --> 20:02.535
Well, I think this
is a very good way.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.037
Me, too.

20:05.104 --> 20:06.506
I'm buying you
all this stuff,

20:06.573 --> 20:10.042
but, as punishment
for letting seagulls
in my house,

20:10.109 --> 20:11.878
you can't play
with it for a month.

20:11.944 --> 20:13.780
A month?

20:13.846 --> 20:16.182
Pretty smart, huh?

20:16.249 --> 20:17.817
It's not fair.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.020
You know what
this is?

20:21.087 --> 20:23.256
The world's smallest violin.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.727
What are you talking about?

20:38.271 --> 20:40.273
They're gone,
Charlie.

20:41.808 --> 20:43.142
Are you sure?

20:43.209 --> 20:44.911
Check under the bed.

20:47.447 --> 20:48.881
All clear.

20:49.982 --> 20:51.918
Okay.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.420
I wonder why they left.

20:53.486 --> 20:56.923
Maybe because
we stopped feeding them.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.925
Whoa, check it out.

21:02.295 --> 21:03.896
Wow.

21:03.963 --> 21:06.098
You know what this
means, don't you?

21:06.165 --> 21:07.066
Yeah.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.268
Breakfast.
