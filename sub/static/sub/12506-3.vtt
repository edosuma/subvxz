00:05.606 --> 00:07.041
[Kaylie] Previously
on Make It Or Break It:

00:07.075 --> 00:09.677
[woman] I was presented
with evidence

00:09.710 --> 00:11.112
of inappropriate conduct.

00:11.145 --> 00:13.047
Here it is.

00:13.081 --> 00:14.615
[exhales]

00:14.648 --> 00:15.716
Hey, you OK?

00:17.651 --> 00:20.654
For the next eight weeks, you
need to forget about The Rock.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.090
[man] The National
Gymnastics Organization

00:22.123 --> 00:25.626
knows how strong this team is,
how strong its captain is.

00:25.659 --> 00:29.163
Starting today, the girl I
put you with is your other half.

00:29.197 --> 00:31.765
- It's you and me, Kaylie.
- You and me, girl.

00:31.799 --> 00:34.602
Thank you for being my partner
and making me look good.

00:34.635 --> 00:37.738
- Ditto.
- I guess I know Payson
better than you.

00:40.774 --> 00:42.610
It can all change in a moment.

00:42.643 --> 00:44.712
Every day you have to earn
your right to be here,

00:44.745 --> 00:46.780
or you could be that girl
packing to go home.

00:46.814 --> 00:49.650
[man] After triumphing
over a broken back,

00:49.683 --> 00:52.186
reinventing yourself
as an artistic gymnast,

00:52.220 --> 00:54.655
and pulling a Kerri Strug
at Worlds,

00:54.688 --> 00:55.756
people are calling you
"The Comeback Kid".

00:55.789 --> 00:57.191
How's that make you feel?

00:57.225 --> 01:00.628
I was glad to go out
on a limb for you, Mac.

01:00.661 --> 01:03.731
I appreciate just how far
on that limb you had to go.

01:05.065 --> 01:08.702
We both know the NGO is not
in the business of doing favors.

01:08.736 --> 01:10.037
So, how's it going?

01:10.070 --> 01:11.705
Coaching girls
for the first time must be

01:11.739 --> 01:13.174
like learning a new language.

01:13.207 --> 01:17.077
Girls, boys... at this level,
an athlete is an athlete.

01:17.111 --> 01:19.647
Gender doesn't even
play a part.

01:19.680 --> 01:22.683
I've worked
in women's gymnastics
a long time, Mac.

01:22.716 --> 01:24.185
Girls are different.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.053
Not so much.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.189
Sure, we're still trying to
figure out who we are as a team,

01:28.222 --> 01:31.792
but, you know, I'm sure you'll
see that things are solid.

01:31.825 --> 01:33.794
We were surprised to hear
about Jordan Randall.

01:33.827 --> 01:36.730
Wasn't she
a rather late addition
to your roster?

01:36.764 --> 01:39.066
Marcus, you gotta trust me.

01:39.099 --> 01:43.137
I trust that you can deliver
the next gold medal team
for the USA.

01:43.171 --> 01:45.806
I'm just one person
you need to please, Mac.

01:45.839 --> 01:48.776
You got a whole organization
chomping at the bit

01:48.809 --> 01:50.778
to hear a positive report
on your progress.

01:50.811 --> 01:53.847
And I'm sure you'll be able
to report that they picked
the right coach.

01:53.881 --> 01:55.783
The girls are really starting
to respond to me.

01:57.851 --> 02:00.721
Who would you say is
your inspiration on your quest
for Olympic gold?

02:00.754 --> 02:02.690
Sasha Belov.

02:02.723 --> 02:06.093
He inspired me every day
to be a better gymnast
and a better person.

02:06.126 --> 02:10.231
And Coach McIntire,
would you also consider him
to be an inspiration?

02:10.264 --> 02:12.300
Oh, well, I don't really
know Coach McIntire yet.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.170
What's that all about?

02:16.204 --> 02:18.706
[Lauren] Payson didn't tell you?

02:18.739 --> 02:21.141
She's doing a piece
for that series
Gold Medal Stories.

02:21.175 --> 02:25.713
Oh, well,
I'm sure she just forgot.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.248
It's a major deal
that they picked her first.

02:27.281 --> 02:30.284
I mean, I'm sure eventually
we'll all get one.

02:30.318 --> 02:36.123
I guess between Austin and KP,
you're never around.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.293
The fact that they're
featuring Payson just means
she's a good story.

02:39.327 --> 02:41.161
It doesn't mean she'll
make the Olympic Team.

02:41.195 --> 02:43.831
And really, isn't that
what we're here for?

02:43.864 --> 02:46.300
Jealous much?

02:48.836 --> 02:49.903
That's what a coach
like Sasha does:

02:49.937 --> 02:53.207
He makes you feel
like the impossible is possible.

02:53.241 --> 02:55.309
Honestly, I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for him.

02:55.343 --> 02:57.144
I wish he was here right now.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.812
Interesting to hear
you say that.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.881
Let's talk about
that kissing scandal.

03:00.914 --> 03:04.218
That picture of you
and Sasha Belov kissing

03:04.252 --> 03:07.154
was the talk
of the gymnastics world
for months.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.224
It went viral like wildfire.
Of course, later it was shown

03:10.258 --> 03:12.293
that he couldn't have
pushed you away faster,

03:12.326 --> 03:15.963
but it all must've been
humiliating for you, right?

03:17.798 --> 03:20.234
Ms. Keeler, do you care
to comment?

03:21.369 --> 03:25.205
[clears throat]
No. I have no comment.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.246
[crowd cheering]

03:37.351 --> 03:39.887
[rock music plays]

03:40.921 --> 03:43.223
[indistinct chattering]

03:44.825 --> 03:48.228
* Time to keep my window

03:48.262 --> 03:51.332
* Open wide

03:51.365 --> 03:54.868
How am I supposed to put this
behind me when people keep
asking me about it?

03:54.902 --> 03:57.204
I kissed my coach,
I didn't kill someone.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.206
It was one stupid mistake!

03:59.239 --> 04:04.378
- Pay, I think you're good.
- I'm just so over this.

04:04.412 --> 04:07.348
I feel like that stupid kiss
is going to haunt me
for the rest of my life.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.883
- [both cough]
- Pay?

04:09.917 --> 04:12.386
You're a few weeks away
from the biggest day
of your life.

04:12.420 --> 04:13.854
Don't let this get to you.

04:13.887 --> 04:16.324
Yeah, you need to focus
on what's important,

04:16.357 --> 04:19.226
- not some silly gossip.
- [Payson] You're right.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.962
This is a distraction
I can't afford.

04:21.995 --> 04:25.232
Hey! What are we talking about?

04:25.265 --> 04:28.936
* I'll get
my piece of the sky *

04:28.969 --> 04:32.306
Come on, guys. I'm not Jordan.
It's not like I'm going
to narc to the coach.

04:34.975 --> 04:37.878
[scoffs] OK, never mind.

04:42.015 --> 04:45.285
Sorry, I should spot her.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.424
Did Kaylie just diss us for KP?

04:50.458 --> 04:52.393
Looks that way.

04:55.396 --> 04:59.400
All right, Mac, give me
something to bring back
to the powers that be.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.035
[rap music plays]

05:02.069 --> 05:03.471
- * Get, get
- * Get up on it

05:04.372 --> 05:05.939
[grunts]

05:05.973 --> 05:08.041
That is not even close
to trying, Cruz.

05:08.075 --> 05:10.043
Where's your form?

05:10.077 --> 05:12.279
Your presence
is lazy and sluggish.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.415
Do you even
want to be here?

05:14.448 --> 05:16.016
- * Get, get
- * Get up on it

05:16.049 --> 05:17.418
- * Get
- * Get up on it

05:17.451 --> 05:19.019
- * Get, get
- * Get up on it

05:19.052 --> 05:21.389
* Yes, you have
to work it, girls *

05:21.422 --> 05:22.456
* It's a must

05:22.490 --> 05:23.457
* And you better
bring your boys *

05:23.491 --> 05:24.958
* Or bite the dust

05:24.992 --> 05:29.029
You call that extension?
Not good enough. Again.

05:29.062 --> 05:31.999
You'll do this all day
if you have to. Move!

05:32.032 --> 05:34.301
* Ain't got your back
then roll with it
Roll with it *

05:34.334 --> 05:37.405
* To the next gangstress
with the cash and the know *

05:37.438 --> 05:40.408
* And if your man ain't got
a plan or a mission at all*

05:40.441 --> 05:43.977
* You better to leave him
You no need nothin' at all *

05:44.011 --> 05:45.078
* And if your girl
ain't gotta hustle *

05:45.112 --> 05:48.048
Wendy, get over here!

05:48.081 --> 05:50.017
I have this skill.

05:50.050 --> 05:53.521
Keeler needs someone
to show her a skill she should
be able to do in her sleep.

05:55.055 --> 05:58.959
I think you and I
need to have a talk...

05:58.992 --> 06:00.494
...in your office.

06:02.963 --> 06:06.500
I'm sorry I'm late.
That meeting took forever.

06:06.534 --> 06:09.403
So, how'd it go
with Marcus today?

06:09.437 --> 06:12.072
- Good.
- You OK?

06:12.105 --> 06:14.041
Yeah, but...

06:14.074 --> 06:17.411
You know Marcus.
He's always a little uptight.

06:18.412 --> 06:20.448
He expressed his concern.

06:20.481 --> 06:22.983
Concern? About what?

06:24.384 --> 06:27.020
He thought I should be
connecting with the girls more.

06:27.054 --> 06:31.091
- He felt they were
a little skittish.
- Well, what do you think?

06:31.124 --> 06:34.462
I thought they were
a little nervous
'cause he was there.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.564
Nobody could land a damn trick.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.567
Anyway...

06:41.469 --> 06:43.571
I thought maybe we should
have a little vegan take-out?

06:44.505 --> 06:46.373
Excuse me?

06:46.406 --> 06:49.076
What did the body snatchers
do with my husband?

06:49.109 --> 06:51.411
- What? I like veggies.
- OK.

06:51.445 --> 06:54.381
- You know, when they
taste like other things.
- Mm-hmm.

06:54.414 --> 06:57.518
- Is there something
wrong with that?
- No.

06:57.551 --> 07:01.021
[Lauren exhales] I feel like
my legs are going to fall off.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.556
[Payson scoffs]
Mine already have.

07:02.590 --> 07:04.458
That looks
like a strawberry.

07:04.492 --> 07:08.028
It beats looking like a zombie.

07:08.061 --> 07:10.464
Ow, it even hurts to laugh.

07:10.498 --> 07:13.400
You know,
it wouldn't be so bad
if we were getting better.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.503
- But we're not.
- Except, of course,

07:15.536 --> 07:18.438
for little miss
I'm-only-15-and-my-
muscles-never-ache Wendy.

07:18.472 --> 07:21.509
I swear, I want to just
lock her in the equipment cage
and never let her out.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.410
We should put Jordan
in there with her.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.113
Wasn't it interesting
that Coach McIntire

07:26.146 --> 07:29.082
knew all the choreography
to our routines even though
we never showed him?

07:29.116 --> 07:31.519
And who else saw them?
Oh, right. Jordan.

07:31.552 --> 07:33.587
Deffo. Jordan's the narc.

07:33.621 --> 07:36.089
I know we're icing her out,
but we have to turn it up.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.058
Way up. She can't get to London.

07:38.091 --> 07:40.027
I'm not going there
with someone I can't trust.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.496
I don't understand exactly
what she's doing here still.

07:42.530 --> 07:45.065
I don't understand anything
that's going on here.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.504
Do you guys think Coach McIntire
knows what he's doing?

07:50.538 --> 07:53.206
Honestly? No.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.043
- [Payson sighs]
- [Lauren]
What was the NGO thinking?

07:56.076 --> 07:57.611
He's never even
coached girls before.

07:57.645 --> 08:01.048
You're right. His track record
with the boys is great, but...

08:01.081 --> 08:03.116
- We're not boys.
- He's a bully.

08:03.150 --> 08:06.119
You know, I haven't even been
complimented once!

08:06.153 --> 08:08.622
He had me up on that beam
for hours today.

08:08.656 --> 08:11.091
He's always saying,
"Oh, you're just a specialist."

08:11.124 --> 08:13.126
Maybe that's because you never
let me try any other apparatus.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.196
Not to mention
that ranking board
and the pairing up.

08:16.229 --> 08:19.066
I just don't understand
what method he's using.

08:19.099 --> 08:21.134
OK, so,
let's call it what it is.

08:21.168 --> 08:24.204
He drives us,
but doesn't inspire us

08:24.237 --> 08:27.074
and none of us
are advancing.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.610
- So, what do we do?
- If we were any place but here,

08:29.643 --> 08:31.612
we would fire him
or go to a new gym.

08:31.645 --> 08:35.583
[scoffs] But that's not
an option. We're stuck here.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.217
With a coach we don't trust.

08:37.250 --> 08:40.087
Who's blocking our way
to the Olympics.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.089
- I can go to my dad.
- [all] No!

08:42.122 --> 08:47.561
OK. Or we could
just go talk to the NGO.

08:47.595 --> 08:52.199
That's crazy. Nobody has
the guts to talk to the NGO.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.636
Coach said I should ice.

08:55.669 --> 08:58.639
There isn't any room in here.
We'll all be done in ten.

08:58.672 --> 09:01.274
And then you can ice... alone.

09:03.210 --> 09:06.546
Oh, and hey, Jordan?
You're dead to us.

09:11.318 --> 09:13.520
Harsh.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.590
- But necessary.
- [cell phone vibrates]

09:21.729 --> 09:23.263
Right here.

09:24.331 --> 09:25.532
Tough practice?

09:25.565 --> 09:27.300
You have no idea.
What are you doing here?

09:27.334 --> 09:29.302
My social media class
got out early,

09:29.336 --> 09:32.239
so I thought I could
catch up with you
before I had to meet my team.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.642
- [bell tolling on phone]
- Which is right now.

09:34.675 --> 09:38.545
- Sorry, that's my alarm.
- Is that Big Ben?

09:38.578 --> 09:40.714
I figure I'll hear
the real Big Ben
at the Olympics,

09:40.748 --> 09:42.750
so it's my constant reminder
to never give up.

09:44.284 --> 09:46.253
Well, it was nice seeing you.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.255
Yeah, you, too.

09:55.629 --> 09:57.597
[bell tolling on phone]

09:57.631 --> 09:59.700
I think Big Ben
really wants you.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.601
I really gotta go.

10:03.270 --> 10:06.273
But even seeing you
for one minute
is worth it, Payson!

10:13.747 --> 10:18.351
Well, I never thought
I'd say this, but I actually
miss my mom's cooking.

10:18.385 --> 10:23.323
If by mom's cooking, you mean
frozen dinners, then yeah,
I miss my mom's, too.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.659
Hey, it was really nice

10:25.693 --> 10:28.595
for the four of us to hang out
after practice, wasn't it?

10:28.628 --> 10:30.597
You don't have
to do that, Kaylie.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.600
- Do what?
- Pretend that we're
all friends.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.303
Post-practice icing
is hardly hanging out.

10:36.336 --> 10:40.373
Look, when you walked
over to us in the gym
and we stopped talking,

10:40.407 --> 10:43.677
I know what it looked like,
but I swear it wasn't
about you.

10:43.711 --> 10:45.345
Then, what was it about?

10:45.378 --> 10:49.783
That whole kissing scandal
with Sasha

10:49.817 --> 10:52.285
came up in the interview
and Payson was freaking out.

10:52.319 --> 10:55.288
And we stopped talking
for her sake, not yours.

10:55.322 --> 10:59.626
- Poor Payson.
- I swear Ellen Beals
is pure evil.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.329
You really think Ellen Beals
is the one that released
that picture?

11:02.362 --> 11:03.764
She wanted
to get rid of Sasha.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.699
Yeah, but it doesn't add up.
Think about it.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.634
Ellen didn't even have
access to The Rock.

11:07.667 --> 11:11.304
- I always thought it had
to be somebody from inside.
- What? No!

11:11.338 --> 11:15.675
Nobody at The Rock would do
something that awful... right?

11:16.810 --> 11:18.746
I know somebody
that could find out.

11:19.813 --> 11:22.415
My mom.
She's tight with the NGO.

11:22.449 --> 11:25.252
One phone call,
she could get the whole scoop.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.821
I don't think we should
go digging. It's not
what Payson wants.

11:27.855 --> 11:30.824
Don't you think Payson
has the right to know?

11:30.858 --> 11:32.826
It could help her.

11:34.694 --> 11:38.766
Oh, sorry, that's Austin.
I promised I'd see him.

11:39.733 --> 11:41.334
Look, thanks for the offer,

11:41.368 --> 11:43.737
but I really think it's best
if we forget the whole thing.

11:43.771 --> 11:47.340
Yeah, I totally understand.
You got it.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.476
- OK. Bye.
- Bye.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.854
Hey, Mom. It's me.

12:02.322 --> 12:03.791
I need to ask you a favor.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.829
[pop music plays]

12:23.243 --> 12:25.212
You do realize
you're staring at me, right?

12:25.245 --> 12:28.048
Mm-hmm.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.150
* Not the right one

12:30.183 --> 12:33.220
* But the left one
gives you speed *

12:35.956 --> 12:38.191
- What's up?
- You know about boys.

12:38.225 --> 12:40.928
- No, now don't do all that.
- Do what?

12:40.961 --> 12:42.229
The smiling and making me
feel ridiculous,

12:42.262 --> 12:44.197
like you're my mom
and I'm going to prom.

12:44.231 --> 12:47.134
OK, I'm sorry.
No smiling, no momming.

12:47.167 --> 12:50.904
- You were saying?
- OK. How do you
know when someone is...

12:50.938 --> 12:52.973
You mean, Rigo. Go on.

12:53.006 --> 12:55.876
How do you know
when a boy is into you?

12:55.909 --> 12:58.946
But not, like, into you
like "I just want
to hook up" into you,

12:58.979 --> 13:02.082
but "into you" into you
like I want to be a couple?

13:02.115 --> 13:06.019
Well, if a guy just wants
to hook up with you, then he
won't put in much effort.

13:06.053 --> 13:08.055
He'll get what he can
and move onto the next girl.

13:08.088 --> 13:11.191
But if a guy really likes you,
then he'll ask you
on a date, a real date.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.961
It can't be
over text or email.
It's got to be in person.

13:13.994 --> 13:16.930
But with both our schedules,
we can't find any time.

13:16.964 --> 13:19.967
- Then you make time.
- But it's all so complicated.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.137
Pay, it's only so complicated
if you make it complicated.

13:24.171 --> 13:28.108
I never thought
in a million years I'd be
crushing on someone at the TC.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.943
- Can I smile?
- Yes! Yes!

13:31.044 --> 13:33.280
- Finally! Oh.
- [knocking at door]

13:37.017 --> 13:39.052
I was just... leaving!

13:44.958 --> 13:49.196
- Is she OK?
- Yeah, just really excited
about practice.

13:49.229 --> 13:52.065
Sorry to ambush you so early
in the morning.

13:52.099 --> 13:53.934
It's the only free time
I have today.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.268
Yeah, tell me about it.

13:55.302 --> 13:57.304
And I swear
I'm not stalking you.

13:57.337 --> 14:00.941
- Maybe just a little?
- OK, maybe a little.

14:00.974 --> 14:04.077
No, the reason
I'm here at six a.m.

14:04.111 --> 14:06.013
is that I want to ask you
out on a date.

14:06.046 --> 14:10.083
And I'm not talking,
like, the coffee shop
or the dining hall.

14:10.117 --> 14:14.321
I mean, like, a real, official,
get-dressed-up, leave-campus
kind of date.

14:14.354 --> 14:18.358
- Are you down?
- Sure. OK, let me
just check my schedule.

14:21.228 --> 14:25.232
All right, so next weekend
is our X-treme Exhibition.
How about Friday night?

14:25.265 --> 14:28.335
I can't Friday. It was
the only time I could fit in
my public speaking class.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.170
How about Thursday
after practice?

14:30.203 --> 14:34.241
Uh, no, I have
my endorsement event. Wednesday?

14:34.274 --> 14:37.010
Tuesday and Wednesday
I'm booked up with
the Healthy Bar reps.

14:37.044 --> 14:39.012
And we're
in double conditioning
this week.

14:39.046 --> 14:41.014
- Tonight?
- Tonight is...

14:42.215 --> 14:44.284
...perfect.

14:50.123 --> 14:52.159
Pony tails and glitter
don't win gold medals.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.394
Oh! But selling out
your teammates does?

14:56.096 --> 14:59.199
Let me guess. Kaylie Cruz
is leading that rumor.

14:59.232 --> 15:04.371
Look, you guys can beat me up
all you want, but you have
no idea what you're up against.

15:04.404 --> 15:09.242
I'm a survivor,
and I promise you I will be
on the team going to London.

15:11.078 --> 15:13.080
Look, I got news for you:

15:13.113 --> 15:16.016
You might not want to trust
everything Kaylie has to say.

15:16.049 --> 15:18.385
What? You think
she's your friend?

15:18.418 --> 15:22.289
All she's good for
is deserting people.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.158
Just you wait and see.

15:27.227 --> 15:29.062
Oh, thanks.

15:35.168 --> 15:39.339
- [Payson] Mr. McGowen?
- Hey, Payson. Nice to see you.

15:39.372 --> 15:42.309
- I'm sorry to bother you
like this.
- No, it's never a bother.

15:45.345 --> 15:48.248
The team is worried
about Coach McIntire.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.117
Really?

15:50.150 --> 15:51.318
I'm not one to complain,

15:51.351 --> 15:53.386
and you know I don't
blame other people
for my shortcomings.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.255
I love to be pushed
to train hard.
And it's not about that.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.258
What are you trying
to tell me, Payson?

16:00.127 --> 16:04.264
I look around the gym
and I see a bunch of girls
who aren't advancing...

16:04.297 --> 16:08.135
...as a team. Olympic Trials
are six weeks away,

16:08.168 --> 16:10.137
and we just don't think
Coach McIntire is up to it.

16:10.170 --> 16:14.141
Have any of you tried
to talk to Coach McIntire
about your concerns?

16:14.174 --> 16:18.245
It's sort of hard to talk to him
when all he does is yell at us.

16:19.246 --> 16:20.280
All right, listen.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.349
I appreciate you coming
to me, Payson.

16:22.382 --> 16:25.452
And I want you to know
that the NGO hears you. OK?

16:33.226 --> 16:35.195
[up-tempo music plays]

16:37.497 --> 16:42.102
- Any better?
- Same as last time.

16:42.135 --> 16:44.371
All right, give me
the watch. You're up.

16:46.439 --> 16:50.477
So I've been thinking a lot
about what you said last night.
About Ellen Beals.

16:50.510 --> 16:54.147
And you're right.
It just doesn't add up.

16:54.181 --> 16:56.316
She wasn't even there
the week that it happened,

16:56.349 --> 16:59.219
so who else would
want Sasha gone?

17:00.353 --> 17:03.190
I don't know,
but we could find out.

17:03.223 --> 17:06.193
Do you want me
to call my mom?

17:06.226 --> 17:08.261
I really think
that this could help Payson.

17:08.295 --> 17:11.364
And aren't you just
a tiny bit curious to know
who betrayed you guys?

17:11.398 --> 17:14.267
This could've brought down
your whole gym.

17:14.301 --> 17:17.137
I know.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.339
[Kelly] We wouldn't even
have to tell her

17:19.372 --> 17:21.174
if you thought
it was too much.

17:22.342 --> 17:28.215
OK, but just between you and me
for now. Promise?

17:28.248 --> 17:29.249
Promise.

17:31.251 --> 17:34.287
Those two sure have gotten
pretty tight.

17:34.321 --> 17:37.224
[Payson] Kaylie and KP are
paired up, just like we are.

17:37.257 --> 17:40.393
We spend all our time
together now. I wouldn't
take it so personally.

17:42.262 --> 17:45.298
Jordan says Kaylie
eventually deserts her friends.

17:45.332 --> 17:49.369
And you're actually choosing
to believe something
that Jordan said?

17:49.402 --> 17:54.441
Lauren, trust me. Once we're all
on the Olympic Team, everything
will go back to normal.

17:54.474 --> 17:57.444
But first we gotta make
the Olympic Team, so please...

17:57.477 --> 17:59.379
- You're up.
- [clears throat]

17:59.412 --> 18:02.249
* Come on, girl
I'm in the zone *

18:02.282 --> 18:04.251
* Come on, come on
Can you feel this? *

18:04.284 --> 18:08.255
* Hit me up, baby
and let me know *

18:08.288 --> 18:10.423
[woman vocalizing]

18:39.619 --> 18:42.355
- [heart beating loudly]
- [exaggerated breathing]

18:50.430 --> 18:53.266
Lauren! Lauren, are you OK?!
Can you hear me?!

18:53.300 --> 18:55.535
Lauren! Lauren, come on!
Wake up!

18:55.568 --> 18:57.570
What happened?
Are you all right?

18:57.604 --> 19:00.407
I'm fine. I'm fine.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.443
My hands just slipped.
That's all.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.612
They were sweaty.
It's no big deal.

19:21.561 --> 19:24.597
Lauren, I saw you fall.
You didn't slip.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.566
I told you I'm fine.

19:26.599 --> 19:28.435
It's gymnastics.
We fall all the time.

19:28.468 --> 19:30.670
Not like that we don't.
So, tell me what's going on.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.705
Why do you care so much?

19:32.739 --> 19:35.575
Because right now,
we're more than just teammates.
We're friends,

19:35.608 --> 19:37.710
and real friends don't keep
secrets from each other.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.647
Payson, you're right.

19:40.680 --> 19:44.684
But really,
there's nothing to tell.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.453
Stop.

19:49.656 --> 19:53.693
So that's it? You're giving me
48 hours to fix this problem?

19:53.726 --> 19:55.695
Mac, one of the girls
came to me.

19:55.728 --> 19:58.398
- Which girl?
- That's not important.

19:58.431 --> 20:01.401
It's not about
what one girl said.
It's about what I've seen here.

20:01.434 --> 20:04.471
I can't have
our gymnasts falling apart
right before trials.

20:04.504 --> 20:06.473
They're the commodity,
not you.

20:09.709 --> 20:13.580
I'm really hoping
you can pull this team together.

20:13.613 --> 20:16.483
Because the last thing
I want to do is replace you.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.570
Everyone, listen up!

20:39.706 --> 20:43.476
I'm calling
a mandatory meeting
at my house.

20:43.510 --> 20:45.445
It's more like,
uh, an evening.

20:45.478 --> 20:48.615
It's a... evening meeting.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.786
Six o'clock, don't be late.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.727
I guess this means
no date with lover boy.

21:04.531 --> 21:06.533
Hey, I just got your text
to meet you. I only have...

21:06.566 --> 21:07.600
One minute. I know.
Me, too.

21:07.634 --> 21:08.901
I was so looking
forward to our date tonight...

21:08.935 --> 21:12.472
- But?
- I can't go. Coach McIntire
called a last minute meeting.

21:12.505 --> 21:14.774
Is there any way we can switch
to tomorrow? I'll cancel
my Healthy Bar dinner.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.709
I'm sorry. I can't.
I just found out

21:16.743 --> 21:19.512
that I have to replace
a teammate at a meet in Arizona.

21:19.546 --> 21:21.681
- I'm leaving tomorrow morning.
- For how long?

21:21.714 --> 21:24.617
A week. Man, this is funny,
isn't it?

21:24.651 --> 21:26.719
Just a riot.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.788
I was so psyched to find
a girl like you.

21:28.821 --> 21:31.724
All the girls back home
in Riverside,
they just don't understand

21:31.758 --> 21:34.494
the level of commitment we have
to have to do what we do.

21:34.527 --> 21:37.830
But if you ever find
another athlete,
you can never see them.

21:37.864 --> 21:40.567
We could always meet in London.

21:40.600 --> 21:43.803
- Summer 2012.
- [Big Ben chimes on phone]

21:47.840 --> 21:52.479
Lauren, it's a meeting
at his house. Who cares
what you're wearing?

21:52.512 --> 21:55.515
I know. I'm sorry. I turn
to fashion when I'm nervous.

21:55.548 --> 21:58.551
[sighs] It just feels
like we're being punished.

21:58.585 --> 22:00.520
You don't think
there's any way he found out

22:00.553 --> 22:01.821
we were talking about him
behind his back, do you?

22:01.854 --> 22:05.658
[sighs] I went to Marcus
before practice today.

22:05.692 --> 22:08.561
You did what?!
Are you crazy?

22:08.595 --> 22:09.862
Come on, Lauren.
I had to say something.

22:09.896 --> 22:12.699
Payson, McIntire
is still the coach.

22:12.732 --> 22:16.869
what if he knows it was you
who spilled? You could be
in some major trouble.

22:18.538 --> 22:21.708
God, I am so not
looking forward to this.

22:21.741 --> 22:24.644
Why does he want us
to come to his house?
It doesn't make sense.

22:24.677 --> 22:27.780
I don't know, but we definitely
don't want to be late.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.849
- [sighs]
- [cell phone beeps]

22:29.882 --> 22:30.883
Oh, my phone.

22:37.590 --> 22:39.726
- Oh, my God.
- What?

22:40.627 --> 22:42.629
It's a text from my mom.

22:42.662 --> 22:44.597
Remember we asked her
to find out

22:44.631 --> 22:46.533
who leaked the video
of Payson kissing Sasha?

22:46.566 --> 22:47.767
And?

22:47.800 --> 22:49.869
It was Lauren.

22:58.044 --> 23:00.680
[low-tempo music]

23:00.713 --> 23:03.082
* I dreamed I was
with you that afternoon *

23:03.115 --> 23:05.818
Honey... breathe.

23:05.852 --> 23:08.821
Thanks for making this happen
so last minute.

23:08.855 --> 23:12.091
No worries. Nothing I
like more than making dinner

23:12.124 --> 23:14.393
for six unexpected house guests.

23:16.128 --> 23:17.997
This is getting serious, Annie.

23:19.866 --> 23:24.103
- I really could lose this job.
- But you won't.

23:24.136 --> 23:27.106
Look, I think having
a casual night,
watching training videos

23:27.139 --> 23:30.376
is a fantastic way to get
everyone on the same page.

23:30.409 --> 23:33.980
When Marcus told me
one of the girls went
behind my back, I...

23:36.916 --> 23:38.050
I don't know.

23:38.084 --> 23:40.386
I never had something like that
happen with the boys.

23:40.419 --> 23:43.122
I'm sorry.
That must have felt horrible,

23:43.155 --> 23:47.026
but, honey, you have
to remember these are girls.

23:47.059 --> 23:50.930
OK? They are away
from their homes,
their families.

23:50.963 --> 23:52.965
They're probably just scared.

23:52.999 --> 23:55.968
That's why I thought
bringing them here,

23:56.002 --> 23:58.037
away from the pressures
of the gym,

23:58.070 --> 24:00.072
could make it more personal.

24:00.106 --> 24:02.875
And this way they'll be
a little more receptive to me.

24:02.909 --> 24:06.078
Hon, you can be a tough guy
to warm up to.

24:07.013 --> 24:09.148
You asked me out for six months

24:09.181 --> 24:11.884
before I even said yes,
remember?

24:11.918 --> 24:15.154
Yeah, but I don't have
six months. I got 48 hours.

24:15.187 --> 24:17.890
And I've been given
the raw materials
for possibly

24:17.924 --> 24:22.995
the greatest gymnastic team
in US history,
and if I fail them...

24:23.029 --> 24:25.031
...I'll regret it
for the rest of my life.

24:25.064 --> 24:30.136
Then, failure is not an option,

24:30.169 --> 24:34.140
because my husband doesn't
live with regrets.

24:37.944 --> 24:39.445
I love you.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.147
I love you, too.

24:44.951 --> 24:47.019
This all looks so delicious,
Mrs. McIntire.

24:47.053 --> 24:49.956
Oh, good.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.457
Every now and then,
a home-cooked meal

24:51.490 --> 24:53.092
is just what
the nutritionist ordered.

24:53.125 --> 24:56.095
- Thank you.
- [whispers] I wonder
if he poisoned it.

24:56.128 --> 24:57.964
- OK.
- Thank you.

24:57.997 --> 25:00.132
Hey, Lauren,
how have you been feeling?

25:00.166 --> 25:04.036
- Any recent dizzy spells?
- Nope, I've been feeling great.

25:04.070 --> 25:05.972
Lowering my glycemic index
really did the trick.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.040
- Good.
- Thanks.

25:10.109 --> 25:11.477
- There you go.
- Thanks.

25:11.510 --> 25:12.478
You're welcome.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.013
[cell phone beeps]

25:20.019 --> 25:21.988
Kelly, calm down!
What is going on?

25:22.021 --> 25:23.222
I just got
an email from my mom.

25:23.255 --> 25:25.191
Definite proof
that Lauren is so guilty.

25:25.224 --> 25:28.260
It's a copy
from Lauren to Ellen Beals
with the video attached.

25:28.294 --> 25:30.162
You can see right there
it's from Lauren.

25:30.196 --> 25:32.531
- Yeah.
- Well, uh...

25:34.100 --> 25:36.135
[whispers] What are you
going to do?

25:38.270 --> 25:40.206
Nothing.

25:40.239 --> 25:42.174
This could destroy Payson.

25:42.208 --> 25:45.111
And Lauren is her partner now,
her lifeline to London.

25:45.144 --> 25:47.513
I can't see Payson
get anymore hurt
than she already has.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.515
- OK?
- Yeah.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.183
Now, come on, let's go.

25:53.285 --> 25:55.254
Just going to the bathroom.

25:55.287 --> 25:59.025
- You are such
a grade-A stalker.
- Get a life, Jordan.

26:03.562 --> 26:07.066
[McIntire] This is what I'm
talking about. Right here.

26:07.099 --> 26:11.103
That bend in your legs
is worth a deduction
each and every time you do it.

26:11.137 --> 26:13.272
Tight form, you get it?

26:14.306 --> 26:16.142
Good, 'cause I'm
not gonna tell you again.

26:16.175 --> 26:20.112
And point your toes.
It's supposed to look pretty.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.583
You need to open
your shoulder angle, Payson.

26:24.617 --> 26:27.319
You see there? When you're
swinging around the bar,

26:27.353 --> 26:31.090
you'll get more stretch
and more power if you keep
your elbows by your ears.

26:31.123 --> 26:33.125
Yeah, that's one way
of doing it, but...

26:33.159 --> 26:36.128
Do you even think for one moment
there is room here for excuses?

26:36.162 --> 26:41.133
I'm not making any excuses.
I'm explaining another way.

26:41.167 --> 26:42.601
Sounds like an excuse to me.

26:42.635 --> 26:45.171
Jordan, no one
asked for your opinion.

26:45.204 --> 26:47.239
And I know my own strengths.

26:47.273 --> 26:51.343
- [sighs] Well, then it looks
like you just coach yourself.
- I said, "All right!"

26:52.211 --> 26:53.212
OK.

26:55.181 --> 26:58.384
Tonight isn't entirely
about work. We're going
to have some fun, too.

27:01.353 --> 27:04.590
Have you all seen
Remember the Titans?
It's very inspiring.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.292
The men's team watched it
before every tournament.

27:06.325 --> 27:09.195
It absolutely bonded us
as a team.

27:09.228 --> 27:11.263
I thought it could be
our ritual, too.

27:12.364 --> 27:14.300
I know you guys
are gonna love it.

27:15.201 --> 27:16.669
[music plays in movie]

27:32.651 --> 27:35.087
Way to screw things up, Jordan.

27:35.121 --> 27:36.388
Oh, please, you're all pathetic.

27:36.422 --> 27:39.358
- Hey!
- You whine and complain...

27:39.391 --> 27:42.394
- I don't!
- Just do your job, OK?
That's why we're here.

27:42.428 --> 27:44.330
Why are you
attacking everyone?

27:44.363 --> 27:47.266
Well, look who speaks.

27:47.299 --> 27:49.401
Maybe you'd like to share
something with the group?

27:49.435 --> 27:51.137
What are you talking about?

27:51.170 --> 27:52.404
Oh, I don't know.

27:52.438 --> 27:56.408
Maybe something
you guys found out
in the hallway tonight?

27:56.442 --> 28:01.147
Or maybe something
you'd like to share
with your dear friend Payson?

28:01.180 --> 28:03.215
Stop it, Jordan. It is fine
if you want to hate me,

28:03.249 --> 28:05.184
but do not drag
other people into this.

28:05.217 --> 28:09.388
Hey, I just figured Payson
would like to know who sent
the kiss cam video to the NGO.

28:10.356 --> 28:11.657
What is she talking about?

28:11.690 --> 28:14.360
Can't we all just get along?
I made cookies.

28:14.393 --> 28:17.363
- [all] Shut up!
- Kaylie, if you've
ever been my friend,

28:17.396 --> 28:19.398
you'll tell me right now.
What is Jordan talking about?

28:19.431 --> 28:21.700
- Payson, please...
- No, no, it's OK, Payson.

28:21.734 --> 28:24.336
I can assure you
that Kaylie was
never your friend.

28:24.370 --> 28:25.671
- See, I'll tell you the truth.
- No!

28:25.704 --> 28:27.273
- It was...
- Don't do this!

28:27.306 --> 28:29.441
It was Lauren, all right?
It was Lauren.

28:40.719 --> 28:41.720
[clears throat]

28:43.455 --> 28:48.727
- I already knew that,
but thanks for sharing.
- [Kaylie] Payson!

28:51.463 --> 28:53.199
[door slams]

28:58.337 --> 29:00.472
Remember the Titans?

29:00.506 --> 29:04.476
It always worked with the boys.
Man, this bunch.

29:04.510 --> 29:06.745
They want to know
why I do everything I do.

29:06.779 --> 29:10.382
I'd tell the men to jump,
and they'd just say,
"How high, coach?"

29:10.416 --> 29:14.320
I don't think I have
the same authority here.

29:14.353 --> 29:17.723
I think you have plenty
of authority. It's just...

29:17.756 --> 29:21.760
- What?
- You know when you and I
are having a conflict?

29:21.794 --> 29:24.396
Like our fight
about your deadbeat brother
coming to stay, again?

29:24.430 --> 29:26.398
Yes, like that.

29:26.432 --> 29:28.434
You know how I always want
to know what's going on
in your head?

29:28.467 --> 29:31.871
What you're thinking about?
That's how I feel safe.

29:31.904 --> 29:34.373
And I just want you to tell me
what to do to fix it.

29:34.406 --> 29:35.741
I don't need to know
everything you're thinking.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.845
Exactly! That's how us ladies
are different.

29:40.512 --> 29:41.814
[sighs]

29:58.564 --> 29:59.765
You knew?

29:59.798 --> 30:02.534
Of course I didn't know.

30:02.568 --> 30:06.572
But I wasn't going to let
anyone else embarrass me
about that kiss.

30:11.410 --> 30:16.949
Do you have any idea... any idea
at all how much you hurt me?

30:18.885 --> 30:21.787
I know this sounds horrible...

30:21.820 --> 30:25.457
...but no. Back then, I didn't.

30:26.893 --> 30:29.461
I don't expect you
to ever forgive me, Payson.

30:29.495 --> 30:32.899
What I did
was mean and selfish.

30:34.566 --> 30:37.469
And possibly the worst thing
I have ever done,

30:37.503 --> 30:42.441
but you need to know
it had nothing to do with you.

30:42.474 --> 30:45.577
- I swear.
- Nothing to do with me?

30:45.611 --> 30:49.949
Are you serious?
How can you say that?
It had everything to do with me.

30:49.982 --> 30:53.852
You practically ruined
my entire life,
not to mention Sasha's.

30:55.521 --> 30:57.924
I was so desperate
to make Summer my mom,

30:57.957 --> 31:00.927
and when I saw her
and Sasha getting close,

31:00.960 --> 31:02.528
I don't know, I panicked.

31:03.930 --> 31:05.597
[sighs]

31:08.534 --> 31:13.439
I was scared
she was going to leave me...

31:14.941 --> 31:17.977
...just the way
everyone eventually does.

31:18.010 --> 31:21.513
And why? Why do you think
people leave you, Lauren?

31:26.885 --> 31:28.654
I deserve that.

31:31.490 --> 31:35.494
I never, ever meant
to hurt you, Payson.

31:35.527 --> 31:39.966
And when you said to me
earlier in the gym that...
that we were friends...

31:42.969 --> 31:47.039
...it just meant so much to me.

31:49.008 --> 31:52.544
Because it was
the first time

31:52.578 --> 31:56.482
that I actually
believed someone.

31:57.549 --> 31:59.986
I know I'm a better person now.

32:00.019 --> 32:04.991
Please... please, just give me
a chance to prove it.

32:05.024 --> 32:07.926
- Please?
- I'm sorry, Lauren...

32:11.530 --> 32:13.499
...but I don't think
I can do that.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.642
[sobbing]

32:25.577 --> 32:26.612
[sobbing]

32:26.645 --> 32:28.547
How could you do that?

32:28.580 --> 32:30.582
And to Payson of all people?

32:30.616 --> 32:34.020
You know what, Kaylie? I don't
have to explain myself to you!

32:34.053 --> 32:36.022
Actually, I think you do.

32:36.055 --> 32:38.991
I think you need
to explain yourself
to everybody at The Rock

32:39.025 --> 32:40.959
because you put all of us
in jeopardy!

32:40.993 --> 32:43.695
Well, I guess it's a good thing
we're not at The Rock anymore.

32:43.729 --> 32:45.964
I don't even know you now.

32:45.998 --> 32:48.567
Are you kidding?

32:48.600 --> 32:51.037
How could you know who I am?
I mean, you're
never even around?

32:51.070 --> 32:53.039
I don't think you care
about me or Payson!

32:53.072 --> 32:57.509
You know what?
Jordan was right about you.

32:57.543 --> 33:01.080
You use people,
and then you throw them away.

33:01.113 --> 33:04.050
And I thought I knew you
a little better than that.

33:10.056 --> 33:11.590
Hey, are you OK?

33:13.592 --> 33:14.960
I'm fine.

33:14.993 --> 33:19.065
I'm just... I guess
I'm just finding out
who my real friends are.

33:19.098 --> 33:21.067
You've always got me.

33:33.645 --> 33:37.015
Did Yoast take the job yet?
What happened to the movie?

33:38.684 --> 33:40.052
Am I missing something here?

33:44.790 --> 33:48.060
All right, you know what?

33:48.094 --> 33:50.129
I am utterly baffled
by all of you.

33:50.162 --> 33:55.701
I'm trying here. I really am,
but you need to try, too.

33:55.734 --> 33:59.004
You want to know
why you're really here tonight?

33:59.037 --> 34:03.742
It's not to watch
training videos
or some inspirational movie.

34:03.775 --> 34:07.779
You're here because this team
is falling apart.

34:09.148 --> 34:11.183
There is no trust between us.

34:12.718 --> 34:14.686
I know one of you
went behind my back.

34:16.622 --> 34:18.090
I'd like to know who it was.

34:20.792 --> 34:23.129
It was me.

34:23.162 --> 34:24.796
Why didn't you come to me?

34:24.830 --> 34:28.734
I'm trying to coach the next
gold medal Olympic Team,

34:28.767 --> 34:31.637
- not run a preschool.
- No, you're not.

34:31.670 --> 34:32.704
Excuse me?

34:33.839 --> 34:36.142
You're not coaching us.

34:36.175 --> 34:39.778
You're a bully, you yell
at us, and all you do is tell us
how horrible we are.

34:43.649 --> 34:45.651
Hmm.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.656
Does anyone else feel that way?

34:58.197 --> 35:01.800
Honestly, we feel like you're
just messing with our heads.

35:01.833 --> 35:06.705
You do all these things...
and you don't tell us why.

35:06.738 --> 35:10.176
Like the arbitrary rankings
and the pairings.

35:10.209 --> 35:13.712
And you criticize
everything we do.

35:13.745 --> 35:15.714
You point out everything
we do wrong.

35:15.747 --> 35:17.216
[Wendy] But you never tell us
what we do right.

35:18.750 --> 35:21.153
You haven't told me "good job"
once since I've been here.

35:22.821 --> 35:26.258
And... I need that.

35:28.894 --> 35:30.162
We all do.

35:31.730 --> 35:34.666
You can't bully us
into being good.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.835
You need to believe
in us to be great.

35:38.704 --> 35:40.739
Believe in you?

35:40.772 --> 35:43.175
[scoffs] You girls...

35:45.244 --> 35:49.815
I look at you...
I look at your strength,

35:49.848 --> 35:52.251
your determination,
your perseverance.

35:52.284 --> 35:56.188
I look at your bruised shins
and your blistered hands

35:56.222 --> 35:59.691
and your torn up feet,
and all I feel is belief.

35:59.725 --> 36:04.162
Look, we kind of feel like...

36:04.196 --> 36:06.898
...we don't know
much of anything
when it comes to you.

36:06.932 --> 36:08.734
I mean, you want us
to trust you,

36:08.767 --> 36:11.237
but it's hard when we have
no idea what's going on.

36:14.740 --> 36:16.208
Girls, listen...

36:17.243 --> 36:19.211
...nothing I do is arbitrary.

36:21.247 --> 36:24.716
I paired you up the way I did
because I believe
that each of you

36:24.750 --> 36:27.219
has something specific
to give to your partner.

36:28.887 --> 36:31.890
You'll see that there's
a method to everything I do.

36:31.923 --> 36:35.261
Wendy, you need maturing.

36:35.294 --> 36:38.830
Jordan, you need
some youthful exuberance.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.899
That's why you're together.

36:40.932 --> 36:45.237
Lauren, Payson, you've been
on the same team for six years,

36:45.271 --> 36:49.241
but you've never trusted
each other. Am I right?

36:50.309 --> 36:52.244
I'm trying to build that trust.

36:53.312 --> 36:55.747
Look, if you asked my wife,

36:55.781 --> 37:00.218
she'd tell you
I'm not the most expressive guy
on the planet.

37:00.252 --> 37:03.322
Yes, I can
definitely confirm that.

37:04.923 --> 37:05.991
Thanks.

37:08.927 --> 37:11.963
But I understand that you girls
are professional athletes

37:11.997 --> 37:15.934
at the most clutch time
in your life.

37:15.967 --> 37:18.937
You're not little girls
or normal teenagers.
I understand that.

37:19.971 --> 37:21.773
And what I hear you saying is

37:21.807 --> 37:24.943
you need a partner
in me as well as a coach.

37:24.976 --> 37:27.779
A partner you can trust.

37:27.813 --> 37:32.884
I want to be that partner...
all the way to London.

37:32.918 --> 37:37.289
Let's start tomorrow.
A brand new day.
What do you say?

37:40.258 --> 37:41.893
[doorbell rings]

37:42.961 --> 37:44.930
I got it!

37:48.266 --> 37:51.903
Uh, Payson, you have a visitor.

38:01.313 --> 38:03.982
Coach McIntire, sir...
[clears throat]

38:04.015 --> 38:06.452
I know you're having
a team meeting,
and I don't want to interfere.

38:06.485 --> 38:10.422
Now, I know you may feel
this is inappropriate,

38:10.456 --> 38:14.560
but I promise you... it is.
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't.

38:14.593 --> 38:18.564
I just really want to talk
to Payson for five minutes.
That's all.

38:21.600 --> 38:26.037
You got five minutes.
Five minutes.

38:32.411 --> 38:35.547
Are you crazy coming
to my coach's house?
What are you doing here?

38:35.581 --> 38:38.550
Well, you know how I said
I was leaving tomorrow?

38:38.584 --> 38:41.487
I'm not.
I'm leaving tonight.

38:41.520 --> 38:44.456
And I know this is
going to sound lame,

38:44.490 --> 38:50.362
but I just couldn't stand
the thought of having
to wait another week before...

38:50.396 --> 38:52.531
Before what?

38:52.564 --> 38:54.566
Before I did this.

39:11.082 --> 39:14.352
I'd really like to change
my status on Social Lounge.

39:14.386 --> 39:16.422
That is if you're into it?

39:16.455 --> 39:18.490
I'm so into it!

39:24.430 --> 39:27.499
One week, Miss Keeler.
One week.

39:27.533 --> 39:29.367
Have a great meet!

39:30.502 --> 39:32.438
[Rigo] Woo-hoo!

39:44.382 --> 39:48.587
Why did you take the blame
for me about going to Marcus?

39:48.620 --> 39:51.089
I didn't want you
to get in trouble.

39:51.122 --> 39:55.694
But why? Since when does
Lauren Tanner care
about anyone but herself?

39:58.597 --> 40:01.500
When we started
to become friends...

40:01.533 --> 40:05.103
[sighs] ...it was the first
time I felt like someone was
choosing the real me...

40:05.136 --> 40:07.639
...whoever that is.

40:08.707 --> 40:10.442
I was choosing you.

40:10.476 --> 40:13.111
I never thought
I would say this,

40:13.144 --> 40:15.481
but I really like you.

40:15.514 --> 40:18.183
And that's why it hurt so bad
to hear what you did.

40:21.520 --> 40:24.523
I'm relieved the secret's out.

40:24.556 --> 40:28.460
- I don't want there to be
anymore lies between us.
- But there are still lies.

40:28.494 --> 40:30.596
I know something's wrong
with you, with your health.

40:30.629 --> 40:34.500
And if you really want to be
my friend, just tell me
the truth right now.

40:43.742 --> 40:45.611
Something is wrong.

40:47.212 --> 40:49.615
I don't know what it is,
and I'm scared, Pay.

40:49.648 --> 40:51.683
But I'm more terrified
that I'll get kicked out

40:51.717 --> 40:54.419
before I even get a chance
to make the Olympic Team.

40:54.452 --> 40:58.657
My dream is six weeks away.

41:01.192 --> 41:04.429
I didn't work my entire life
to give up now.

41:04.462 --> 41:07.165
Then we go to a doctor
together.

41:07.198 --> 41:11.670
We figure out what's wrong,
and we make sure you're ready
to compete in six weeks.

41:11.703 --> 41:14.573
Would you keep it between us?

41:14.606 --> 41:17.442
You've been here, Pay,
with your back.
You know what it's like.

41:17.475 --> 41:19.511
I promise.

41:19.545 --> 41:21.680
I promise I won't say anything

41:21.713 --> 41:25.517
as long as you agree
to go get help.

41:26.752 --> 41:28.720
You said together?

41:28.754 --> 41:31.723
Lauren, we're a team.

41:31.757 --> 41:35.226
You fall, I fall. Get it?

41:37.262 --> 41:38.697
I got it.

41:40.599 --> 41:41.667
Good.

41:45.270 --> 41:47.773
So, does this mean we're OK?

41:47.806 --> 41:49.675
No.

41:53.579 --> 41:54.780
But we will be.

42:01.787 --> 42:03.655
[up-tempo music plays]

42:06.558 --> 42:07.726
Hey, coach!

42:07.759 --> 42:11.730
* Woke up this morning
feeling new today *

42:11.763 --> 42:13.799
* Nothing's gonna stop me
'cause I'm on my way *

42:13.832 --> 42:17.636
- Sorry, I was just...
- Hey, forget the fall.

42:17.669 --> 42:21.773
This is the first time
I've actually seen you
square your hips. Good job.

42:21.807 --> 42:24.542
Thanks, coach.

42:26.612 --> 42:28.246
Brand new day.

42:28.279 --> 42:31.583
* I'll be heading
for the highway *

42:31.617 --> 42:33.785
* Today I'm gonna
have some fun *

42:33.819 --> 42:36.788
* I'll be driving
to the beat of my radio *

42:36.822 --> 42:40.592
You were right, coach.
I kept my shoulders by my ears,
and it completely worked!

42:40.626 --> 42:41.793
Thanks!

42:41.827 --> 42:45.530
* To the beat of my radio

42:45.563 --> 42:49.735
* Life goes on and on and on

42:49.768 --> 42:52.270
You're really close, Wendy.
We can fix that.

42:52.303 --> 42:54.606
[relieved sigh] Great!

42:54.640 --> 42:56.574
Thanks, coach.

42:56.608 --> 42:58.677
* I found a brand new vision

42:58.710 --> 43:01.647
* The negative's
about to change *

43:04.315 --> 43:05.817
They got a way to go.

43:05.851 --> 43:08.553
Yes, they do.

43:08.586 --> 43:11.322
- You've come a long way.
- [McIntire chuckles]

43:12.658 --> 43:14.860
And you still
have got six weeks.

43:14.893 --> 43:18.697
* I'll be driving
to the beat of my radio *

43:18.730 --> 43:20.331
Thanks, Marcus.

43:21.599 --> 43:22.701
We won't let you down.

43:22.734 --> 43:25.603
* To the beat of my radio

43:25.637 --> 43:28.774
* To the beat of my radio *
