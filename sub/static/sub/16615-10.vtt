00:00.031 --> 00:02.013
<i>Previously on
"Once Upon a Time"...</i>

00:02.039 --> 00:03.000
But without a genie,

00:03.025 --> 00:05.147
I can't use a wish to
get back to Agrabah.

00:05.172 --> 00:06.104
I think you will.

00:06.418 --> 00:08.386
This is the sword from my vision.

00:08.411 --> 00:09.443
This is the sword that killed you.

00:09.545 --> 00:10.594
Now that we have it,

00:10.619 --> 00:12.223
maybe we can finally
find who's responsible.

00:12.248 --> 00:13.981
And then we can stop them.

00:15.479 --> 00:16.945
Do you really think you've got something

00:16.970 --> 00:18.236
in your vault that can destroy it?

00:18.338 --> 00:21.439
We don't want to destroy
it. We want to understand it.

00:21.541 --> 00:23.074
It's fated to kill her.

00:23.143 --> 00:25.276
The hooded figure who uses
it is fated to kill me.

00:25.379 --> 00:26.911
We need to figure out who that is.

00:27.014 --> 00:29.814
And then we can worry
about destroying things.

00:29.916 --> 00:31.349
Bloody hell.

00:34.588 --> 00:36.179
Get away from him!

00:37.509 --> 00:39.557
Uh, don't worry. I'm not here

00:39.660 --> 00:42.560
to desecrate Robin's
final resting place.

00:43.374 --> 00:45.030
I loved him, too, you know.

00:45.098 --> 00:47.991
[Chuckles] <i> Loved.</i>

00:48.241 --> 00:49.740
Past tense.

00:49.951 --> 00:53.794
Losing Robin Hood was the best
thing that ever happened to us.

00:53.929 --> 00:58.256
It pushed you to liberate <i> me,</i>

00:58.281 --> 01:03.217
to free me from the prison
of your self-loathing,

01:03.312 --> 01:06.747
to make me the best version of us.

01:06.849 --> 01:08.815
Regina, don't let her get to you.

01:08.847 --> 01:11.147
It's too late.

01:11.202 --> 01:12.802
[Chuckles] What are you gonna do?

01:13.022 --> 01:14.621
Throw a fireball at yourself?

01:15.666 --> 01:19.467
The only way to hurt <i>
me</i> is to hurt <i> you,</i>

01:19.570 --> 01:21.837
which is why your friends
won't be able to stop me.

01:21.939 --> 01:26.074
See? Love is weakness.

01:26.616 --> 01:29.678
Say hi to Sleeping Beauty...

01:30.358 --> 01:32.981
or is it Sleeping Daddy?

01:33.520 --> 01:35.287
Emma, no!

01:38.522 --> 01:39.863
[Gasps] Are you...?

01:40.114 --> 01:42.214
I'm... fine.

01:50.033 --> 01:51.299
[Grunts]

01:55.098 --> 01:57.269
We can kill her.

[Thunder rumbles]

02:22.589 --> 02:24.422
Thinking of going for a drive?

02:24.635 --> 02:26.368
Rumple, I'm in no mood.

02:27.947 --> 02:30.505
Looks like the Savior's found a weapon.

02:31.291 --> 02:35.076
Now, normally I'd be upset
that someone stole from me,

02:35.178 --> 02:39.614
but in this case, I think I'll
let Ms. Swan's pilfering slide,

02:39.683 --> 02:42.017
and I can focus on finding my son.

02:42.119 --> 02:44.052
And <i> you</i>

02:44.404 --> 02:46.087
can prepare...

02:47.303 --> 02:49.024
to die.

02:49.627 --> 02:54.252
Now, no matter where
you go, I can find you.

02:54.353 --> 02:59.159
You see, what you did to me,
to Belle, was unforgivable.

02:59.269 --> 03:02.470
So if, at the end of the day,

03:02.572 --> 03:05.640
the Savior has yet to dispatch of you,

03:05.835 --> 03:09.537
rest assured that after I find my son,

03:10.028 --> 03:12.647
I will gladly finish the job.

03:16.086 --> 03:17.819
[Sighs]

03:20.659 --> 03:24.693
So it can hurt the queen
without hurting Regina.

03:25.448 --> 03:27.014
The Evil Queen needs to die.

03:27.163 --> 03:29.798
[Cellphone ringing]

03:29.900 --> 03:30.799
[Cellphone beeps]

03:30.901 --> 03:33.101
Yeah.

03:33.656 --> 03:35.489
You sure about this, love?

03:35.538 --> 03:37.444
In this case, the clichÃ© is true.

03:37.469 --> 03:39.341
I was... born for this.

03:41.108 --> 03:43.578
Henry: Mom.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.013
Don't do it.

03:46.383 --> 03:49.784
Henry, I can stop her.

03:49.809 --> 03:51.342
With this sword, I can save all of us.

03:51.521 --> 03:53.588
That sword is what kills you.

03:53.657 --> 03:56.725
How do you know this isn't
how you die... facing her?

03:57.177 --> 03:59.627
What if she's the figure
under the hood in your vision?

04:00.287 --> 04:01.629
I can't sit out every battle

04:01.654 --> 04:03.987
because I think it might be my last.

04:04.640 --> 04:06.267
I'm the Savior, kid.

04:06.370 --> 04:08.269
You're also my mom.

04:12.642 --> 04:14.676
[Swords clang]

04:16.113 --> 04:17.678
Hey. That was Leroy.

04:17.704 --> 04:20.137
Evil queen was spotted
headed down Main Street.

04:20.317 --> 04:23.018
- All right. Let's go.
- No. You can't.

04:23.120 --> 04:25.060
The only way you can hurt
her is to hurt yourself,

04:25.085 --> 04:26.554
and I can't let you do that.

04:26.656 --> 04:28.156
I've got this.

04:28.258 --> 04:29.424
You need to stay here with Henry.

04:31.795 --> 04:33.361
[Sighs] Good luck.

04:53.350 --> 04:54.816
Woman: Help me!

05:02.259 --> 05:03.992

Ah, ah.

05:06.997 --> 05:09.531
<i>This</i> is about <i> me.</i>

05:09.599 --> 05:11.800
It's always about me.

05:11.868 --> 05:13.668
- Damn right.
- [Whoosh]

05:13.737 --> 05:14.669
[Groans]

05:14.694 --> 05:16.160
I can snap her neck

05:16.273 --> 05:18.606
before you get a step closer.

05:18.708 --> 05:20.108
[Strains]

05:22.875 --> 05:23.978
That's better.

05:24.081 --> 05:26.548
[Breathing heavily]

05:34.991 --> 05:36.257
What the devil?

05:36.326 --> 05:39.060
Mm, not the Devil.

05:39.129 --> 05:39.961
My genie.

05:40.063 --> 05:40.980
I'm sorry.

05:41.005 --> 05:44.706
I believe I have three wishes.

05:44.968 --> 05:47.235
Go ahead. Wish. They
always come with a price.

05:47.304 --> 05:48.736
That they do.

05:48.839 --> 05:53.341
Which is why I'm not going
to wish for something for me.

05:54.316 --> 05:56.644
I'm going to give <i>
you</i> something...

05:56.746 --> 05:59.447
something you've always wanted,

05:59.549 --> 06:03.151
something you confided about to Aladdin.

06:04.187 --> 06:05.120
You heard us?

06:05.778 --> 06:07.622
Don't you know by now?

06:07.724 --> 06:10.125
I hear everything.

06:10.160 --> 06:13.595
You wished you weren't the Savior.

06:13.697 --> 06:16.431
So that's exactly what
you're going to get.

06:16.533 --> 06:20.301
Genie of Agrabah, I wish...

06:20.403 --> 06:22.337
that Emma Swan's wish

06:22.439 --> 06:25.707
to have never been the Savior...

06:25.809 --> 06:27.509
be granted.

06:32.463 --> 06:33.915
- No!
- Emma!

06:34.851 --> 06:37.418
What happened? Where did she go?!

06:48.809 --> 06:49.975
[Exhales sharply]

[Chuckles]

06:54.848 --> 06:56.448
[Applause]

06:56.550 --> 06:58.917
Mommy. Daddy.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.927
So tell us, Princess,
what did you wish for?

07:09.840 --> 07:11.229
Not a thing.

07:11.298 --> 07:14.366
Everything I could
ever want is right here.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.237
[Snaps fingers]

07:27.629 --> 07:29.817
Sweetie, something's bothering you.

07:29.842 --> 07:32.107
- What's wrong?
- [Sighs]

07:32.132 --> 07:34.732
Last night I had a dream that...

07:34.757 --> 07:36.793
that the Queen did cast her curse,

07:36.818 --> 07:39.085
and I was the Savior, as you told me.

07:39.154 --> 07:40.578
Yes, but with the Queen defeated,

07:40.603 --> 07:41.788
all of that was avoided.

07:41.898 --> 07:44.257
Right. Right.

07:44.326 --> 07:46.443
But in my dream,

07:46.491 --> 07:48.157
I was in this strange, fantastical land

07:48.259 --> 07:49.826
unlike anything I'd ever seen before,

07:49.894 --> 07:53.129
and we were still
fighting her... all of us.

07:53.231 --> 07:54.731
And this place... it had a name.

07:54.756 --> 07:56.789
It was called...

07:58.820 --> 08:00.445
Storybrooke.

08:03.216 --> 08:04.682
It was only a dream.

08:04.718 --> 08:07.618
Then when I woke up, I found this.

08:10.992 --> 08:12.090
It was under my bed.

08:12.158 --> 08:14.058
Well, one of the servants
must have put it there.

08:14.127 --> 08:15.898
They <i> were</i> cleaning the armory.

08:15.923 --> 08:18.429
Oh, no. Oh, no.

08:18.531 --> 08:20.431
I'm so sorry. Did I miss it?

08:21.514 --> 08:25.436
I was practicing for tomorrow
and lost track of time.

08:25.538 --> 08:26.838
Can you please forgive me?

08:26.940 --> 08:28.840
Of course, Henry.

08:28.942 --> 08:31.876
I want your knighting
ceremony to be perfect.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.546
You're going to be the noblest knight

08:33.571 --> 08:35.337
the kingdom has ever seen.

08:37.788 --> 08:38.950
Is that for me?

08:39.645 --> 08:40.948
For tomorrow?

08:45.658 --> 08:49.260
My name is Sir Henry,
Knight of the Realm.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.151
And I shall defend all of you.

08:51.878 --> 08:54.198
Your father would be very proud of you.

08:55.495 --> 08:57.035
I wish.

08:57.550 --> 08:59.483
I wish I'd known him.

09:02.783 --> 09:04.509
Emma: He's watching over you.

09:05.945 --> 09:08.379
He's always watching over you.

09:08.992 --> 09:12.173
Now, then, I believe we
have some celebrating to do.

09:12.198 --> 09:13.651
Come.

09:13.753 --> 09:15.019
The party's only just begun.

09:15.121 --> 09:16.788
Of course, Daddy.

09:17.332 --> 09:19.223
Oh, Henry, put that thing away.

09:19.325 --> 09:21.559
This family is done fighting.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.702
- Where did she go?
- We have no idea, Henry.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.538
But we're trying to
figure that out, right?

09:33.606 --> 09:35.840
Because I didn't stay behind
for you to screw things up.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.675
Hey, take it easy on
us. It was the Queen.

09:37.744 --> 09:38.709
I know who it was.

09:38.778 --> 09:40.445
Maybe use some of that defensive energy

09:40.513 --> 09:41.679
to figure out where she is!

09:41.748 --> 09:43.614
You're her father. You
must have some idea.

09:43.716 --> 09:44.715
Yeah, I <i> am</i> her father.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.651
That doesn't mean I know everything.

09:47.204 --> 09:48.686
What about you, Hook?
You live with her now.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.121
Did she give you any ideas?

09:50.190 --> 09:51.255
If I had an idea, don't you think

09:51.324 --> 09:52.690
I would have bloody
well mentioned it by now?

09:52.792 --> 09:53.758
How do you share a home with someone

09:53.860 --> 09:54.859
and not know their secrets?

09:54.928 --> 09:56.225
Because we don't stand around and talk

09:56.250 --> 09:58.239
about what happens when a
bloody genie appears, mate!

09:58.264 --> 10:01.466
Please, stop fighting. Please.

10:01.568 --> 10:04.001
Right now we're doing
exactly what she wants.

10:04.070 --> 10:06.504
She said we would tear ourselves apart,

10:06.539 --> 10:08.806
and that's exactly what we're doing.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.776
The Evil Queen has thrown
a lot of punches today.

10:12.012 --> 10:14.322
But now...

10:14.347 --> 10:16.881
I think I know a way to throw one back.

10:20.687 --> 10:22.420
[Bell jingles]

10:51.618 --> 10:53.317
Show me our son.

10:59.626 --> 11:00.858
No.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.997
[Rattling]

11:09.111 --> 11:11.144
Appletini? Really?

11:11.210 --> 11:12.770
Isn't that a bit on
the nose? Even for you?

11:12.839 --> 11:14.539
I like what I like.

11:14.607 --> 11:16.841
So, it's your wish?

11:16.943 --> 11:20.411
No. A request.

11:21.032 --> 11:24.382
I suggest you heed it or things
will be even less pleasant

11:24.450 --> 11:26.450
than they already are.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.552
That's ambitious.

11:29.889 --> 11:31.956
There's much we can explore

11:32.058 --> 11:35.993
in this master-genie relationship.

11:36.095 --> 11:38.129
[Sighs] Ambition...

11:38.722 --> 11:39.964
met.

11:41.634 --> 11:42.400
[Gasps]

11:42.468 --> 11:44.168
Having fun in my office?

11:44.237 --> 11:46.637
Well, as a matter of
fact, I was about to.

11:49.876 --> 11:50.942
Ew.

11:50.967 --> 11:53.421
I'm not here for your perversions.

11:53.446 --> 11:54.585
I'm here to get Emma back.

11:54.610 --> 11:56.914
Oh, well, good luck with that.

11:56.983 --> 11:59.517
You're not getting ahold of this lamp.

11:59.619 --> 12:03.421
But even if you did,
you can't undo wishes.

12:03.489 --> 12:04.822
Sadly true.

12:05.532 --> 12:06.865
Now...

12:07.353 --> 12:09.126
take a seat.

12:09.688 --> 12:12.296
Have a drink.

12:13.119 --> 12:15.967
And give thanks where thanks is due.

12:16.494 --> 12:18.869
What the hell are you talking about?

12:20.473 --> 12:23.107
Be a dear and mix another, hmm?

12:24.028 --> 12:26.244
Don't forget...

12:27.103 --> 12:30.830
I know you better than anyone, Regina.

12:30.893 --> 12:32.550
[Chuckles] I <i> am</i> you.

12:33.330 --> 12:35.953
And there was a time when all you wanted

12:36.022 --> 12:38.689
was to tear Snow and Charming apart

12:38.791 --> 12:41.192
and kick Emma Swan out of your town.

12:41.294 --> 12:44.829
And <i> I</i> just did both.

12:44.911 --> 12:46.745
[Laughs]

12:46.833 --> 12:48.299
A toast.

12:48.401 --> 12:49.934
To you.

12:50.003 --> 12:51.936
To me.

12:52.038 --> 12:53.437
To us.

13:01.047 --> 13:03.247
[Sighs]

13:03.969 --> 13:06.459
That's why you'll never be happy.

13:06.954 --> 13:10.955
You've won, and you can't even admit it.

13:11.767 --> 13:17.228
If you could, you'd see
that victory feels luxurious.

13:17.297 --> 13:23.000
Yes, I... may not be able to
get ahold of that genie lamp,

13:23.624 --> 13:25.357
but you're right.

13:25.382 --> 13:27.838
We <i> are</i> the same person,

13:27.874 --> 13:31.942
which means you're not the
only master of the lamp.

13:35.633 --> 13:36.899
No.

13:37.491 --> 13:38.482
Yes.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.184
Genie of the Lamp,

13:40.253 --> 13:42.987
I wish to be sent to the
same place as Emma Swan.

13:43.089 --> 13:45.389
- No!
- Your wish is my command, Master.

Hey!

14:17.123 --> 14:20.124
I'm... I'm looking for
Emma. Have you seen her?

14:21.356 --> 14:22.793
Have you <i> seen</i> her?

14:22.895 --> 14:24.362
The Evil Queen is back.

14:24.464 --> 14:25.896
No, no, you don't understand.

14:25.998 --> 14:29.200
I'm... I'm... I'm not
the Evil Queen anymore.

14:29.268 --> 14:30.968
Move! Move! We must warn them!

Emma?

15:18.189 --> 15:19.589
âª La da da... âª

15:21.953 --> 15:23.961
What the hell happened to you?

15:24.030 --> 15:26.097
You...

15:26.199 --> 15:27.732
You're the Evil Queen.

15:27.801 --> 15:29.701
You don't remember me.

15:29.803 --> 15:31.502
I know exactly who you are.

15:31.604 --> 15:33.371
My parents banished you.

15:33.473 --> 15:35.707
Uh, no, they didn't. [Chuckles]

15:35.775 --> 15:37.341
None of this is real.

15:37.410 --> 15:38.810
I'm your friend.

15:38.845 --> 15:41.245
You're no one's friend. My
father said you were a liar.

15:41.314 --> 15:42.914
No, it's not a lie.

15:42.939 --> 15:45.607
Where we're from, we actually...

15:45.719 --> 15:47.418
share custody of a son.

15:48.958 --> 15:51.622
Okay, it's complicated, but...

15:51.691 --> 15:54.225
the point is I risked
my life coming here

15:54.294 --> 15:56.994
because you're the Savior...

15:57.902 --> 16:00.436
and your family needs you.

16:06.357 --> 16:08.424
This is impossible. You were banished.

16:08.492 --> 16:10.025
The fairies saw to it
you could never return.

16:10.127 --> 16:11.594
There's no way you
can be here right now.

have</i> to believe me.

16:37.955 --> 16:39.221
Never.

This blade banished you
from the kingdom once before.

I can't do this. I can't
just sit by and wait.

17:00.733 --> 17:02.544
The Queen is out there,
and she's got more wishes.

17:02.613 --> 17:04.780
Don't worry, mate. Regina will
be back with Emma soon enough.

17:04.805 --> 17:06.238
And then what?

17:06.384 --> 17:08.022
What's to stop her
from making another wish

17:08.048 --> 17:09.818
that sends them someplace even worse?

17:09.920 --> 17:11.753
She's done too much
damage to this family.

17:11.789 --> 17:13.021
I am not gonna wake my wife

to tell her our daughter is missing!

I'm gonna get that lamp.

Mate!

17:20.688 --> 17:21.888
There is nothing I want more

17:21.914 --> 17:24.063
than to make the Evil Queen
pay for what she did to Emma,

17:24.088 --> 17:25.579
but we are outgunned.

17:26.305 --> 17:27.670
We don't have magic.

And we don't even have that sword

that she thought she
could use to defeat her.

17:30.408 --> 17:32.675
We need a plan.

17:32.743 --> 17:36.211
So, any thoughts on this plan?

17:36.272 --> 17:38.488
I can't bear to think what
she's doing to Aladdin.

I know, love. I know.

in this reality...

19:00.765 --> 19:01.830

19:01.899 --> 19:04.733
which isn't even a reality.

19:09.175 --> 19:11.006
Now I'm intrigued.

19:13.477 --> 19:18.247
This world was created by a wish

19:18.349 --> 19:20.215
to trap Emma.

19:21.291 --> 19:22.232
Emma?

19:23.387 --> 19:24.586
Emma...

help you, after all!

19:29.226 --> 19:31.193
For a price.

19:31.262 --> 19:32.795
[Chuckles] A deal?

Well, no one knows more
about Saviors than I.

All I need in return is one
teeny, tiny, little thing...

19:44.430 --> 19:46.842
my freedom.

19:47.952 --> 19:49.195
No.

19:50.109 --> 19:51.747
It's not worth it.

19:51.816 --> 19:53.649
The world is better off
with you behind bars.

19:53.751 --> 19:57.553

this world isn't real.

out of a not-real prison
into a not-real world, hmm?

20:07.321 --> 20:09.254
You actually have a point,

20:09.366 --> 20:14.203
but I know better than to take
one of your deals in any realm.

20:14.271 --> 20:17.239
Do you know why Emma became
the Savior in the first place?

[Laughs] Yes!

20:21.245 --> 20:23.111

not this sniveling, pathetic,

that the world needs a Savior.

what do you call it... uh,

21:26.518 --> 21:28.252
That matters not.

What does matter is...

21:30.812 --> 21:34.247
âª I can find you a magic bean âª

Yes, yes, right, right.

noon down by the lake.

inspire fear anymore.

If you're going to play
the part of Evil Queen,

22:19.201 --> 22:21.902
you should look like one, as well.

22:26.514 --> 22:28.203
How's that?

22:28.305 --> 22:30.147
Much better!

Much, much, much better!

You sped up my pregnancy?

22:59.448 --> 23:04.150
Yeah, well, the fairies
sped up my recovery.

23:04.194 --> 23:07.594

23:07.633 --> 23:09.200
And please don't ask me

23:09.268 --> 23:11.902
because I will not be telling
you where I've sent our son.

23:11.938 --> 23:14.038
Belle, he's gone.

23:16.056 --> 23:19.310
I used strands of our hair,
our essence, to track him.

23:19.821 --> 23:21.254
He's not here.

23:21.279 --> 23:23.147
He's nowhere.

I also know that my words
mean nothing to you now,

[Snaps fingers]

There.

23:31.924 --> 23:34.258
This is not about control.

This is about whether our son is safe.

Fine. Don't take my word for it.

once. We'll do it again.

25:39.293 --> 25:42.728
It is with pride in our hearts that we,

25:43.155 --> 25:47.933
Queen Snow and King David
of the Enchanted Forest,

25:47.958 --> 25:49.291
do dub you...

25:49.470 --> 25:51.770
[Doors open, crowd gasps]

25:57.078 --> 25:59.044
Sorry I'm late.

26:05.152 --> 26:07.152
It's the Queen! Run!

26:08.825 --> 26:11.223
She's not the queen anymore!

26:11.325 --> 26:12.758
Look at them,

26:12.827 --> 26:19.231
missing out on this... happy, happy day.

26:19.333 --> 26:23.168
I vowed to destroy their happiness

26:23.271 --> 26:25.671
if it is the last thing I do.

26:27.174 --> 26:29.575
Please.

26:29.651 --> 26:31.384
Don't hurt my parents.

26:31.412 --> 26:35.881
Oh, but you see, hurting
them is the point...

26:37.218 --> 26:41.820
unless you know of some
hero who can stop me.

26:49.030 --> 26:50.851
Mercy, please.

26:50.876 --> 26:51.842
[Sighs]

26:52.922 --> 26:55.534
Look for that hero...

26:55.636 --> 26:57.536
Princess,

26:57.561 --> 26:59.494
and when you find one,

26:59.607 --> 27:01.173
you know where to find us.

27:07.415 --> 27:11.183
[Crowd gasps, murmuring]

27:14.161 --> 27:16.194
Mom.

27:16.390 --> 27:17.656
What do we do?

27:18.029 --> 27:21.126
Don't worry, kid. I have this.

27:23.183 --> 27:25.297
Hook: He said 10:00. Right?

27:25.808 --> 27:27.466
Where is David, anyway?

27:28.206 --> 27:30.135
He's late. It's not like him.

27:35.643 --> 27:38.243
Ah, David.

27:38.312 --> 27:39.511
[Chuckles evilly]

27:39.580 --> 27:41.747
I thought I smelled earnestness.

27:41.849 --> 27:43.315
Please pick it up.

27:43.384 --> 27:44.683
Why me?

27:44.785 --> 27:46.385
You're the one who dropped it.

27:46.420 --> 27:49.655
Because I'm starting to
wonder if you still have it.

27:49.765 --> 27:53.458
An assassin, Gold's magic, a genie?

27:54.402 --> 27:56.053
Why don't you try
doing something yourself

27:56.122 --> 27:58.155
for a change, you snake!

27:58.265 --> 27:59.865
Ohh!

28:00.013 --> 28:01.479
Snake?

28:01.977 --> 28:05.663
You do realize you <i> can't</i> kill me,

28:05.765 --> 28:09.208
- you imbecilic shepherd.
- Ohh.

28:09.243 --> 28:10.643
Ah!

28:11.354 --> 28:12.978
Thanks for the tip.

28:13.080 --> 28:15.706
I know I can't kill you.

28:15.731 --> 28:18.532
But I can do something much worse.

28:30.398 --> 28:32.331
David, are you my new master?

28:33.543 --> 28:35.067
Yeah, Aladdin, I am.

28:43.453 --> 28:44.585
Careful.

28:44.620 --> 28:48.082
Don't dabble with forces
you don't understand.

28:48.107 --> 28:49.827
Oh, I'm gonna be quite careful.

28:49.859 --> 28:50.963
Your wish is my command,

28:50.988 --> 28:52.696
especially if it's gonna hurt her.

28:52.721 --> 28:54.727
But remember, all
wishes come with a price.

28:54.752 --> 28:56.223
David: Oh, I know.

28:56.258 --> 28:58.018
That's why I'm not gonna
wish for anything to do

28:58.043 --> 29:00.971
with Emma or Snow or anyone
I actually care about.

29:00.996 --> 29:02.329
No, Aladdin.

29:02.431 --> 29:05.120
The only one that's gonna
pay the price is her.

29:05.370 --> 29:07.367
Genie...

29:07.403 --> 29:09.603
I wish...

29:09.671 --> 29:13.573
that the Evil Queen gets exactly...

29:13.642 --> 29:15.475
what she deserves.

29:23.631 --> 29:24.730
Aladdin, what's going on?

29:24.755 --> 29:26.553
I don't know. I granted your wish.

29:28.260 --> 29:29.610
[Laughs]

29:29.635 --> 29:31.191
No, you didn't.

29:31.226 --> 29:33.140
You wasted it.

29:34.015 --> 29:37.324
All I ever wanted was
to rip your family apart,

29:37.349 --> 29:38.939
and now look.

29:39.166 --> 29:42.034
Your daughter's trapped in a wish.

29:42.453 --> 29:45.238
And your wife is slumbering forever.

29:45.307 --> 29:50.010
And you... you are all left alone.

29:50.112 --> 29:51.445
Don't you get it?

29:51.834 --> 29:54.802
You can't wish for me to
get everything I deserve

29:54.827 --> 29:57.227
because I already have it.

29:57.322 --> 29:59.063
I will destroy you!

29:59.134 --> 29:59.999
[Grunts]

30:00.068 --> 30:01.034
[Whoosh]

30:01.136 --> 30:02.769
[Sword clanks]

30:02.871 --> 30:05.271
Look at you.

30:05.407 --> 30:08.174
Such bloodlust.

30:08.276 --> 30:11.911
I always knew darkness would
be a lovely shade on you.

30:12.013 --> 30:14.147
- David!
- [Gurgling]

30:14.249 --> 30:16.983
Aladdin? You're okay!

30:17.085 --> 30:18.384
Hook: Let him go.

30:18.787 --> 30:21.287
You're outnumbered,
and we've got the lamp.

30:21.528 --> 30:23.456
You've lost.

30:23.558 --> 30:24.524
[Whoosh]

30:24.626 --> 30:26.326
[Coughs]

30:26.394 --> 30:28.695
Death is too good for you.

30:28.763 --> 30:30.063
[Groaning]

30:30.546 --> 30:35.001
I'd rather watch you suffer.

30:38.306 --> 30:39.939
[Gasping]

30:44.179 --> 30:46.980
Whatever you're planning, it won't work.

30:47.048 --> 30:48.781
We'll defeat you, Regina. We always...

30:48.817 --> 30:50.049
Defeat me. I know. I know.

30:50.151 --> 30:52.685
That's what I'm counting on.

30:52.787 --> 30:55.421
Don't worry. She's
not going to hurt you.

30:55.523 --> 30:56.623
It's going to be okay.

30:59.127 --> 31:01.794
I knew you'd find the hero in you.

31:02.193 --> 31:05.164
Now, let's get this over with.

31:07.602 --> 31:09.435
What is that?

31:09.912 --> 31:11.445
Some kind of weapon?

31:12.273 --> 31:13.642
The key to our kingdom,

31:13.667 --> 31:16.268
which is now yours, Your
Majesty. We surrender.

31:17.344 --> 31:18.679
Seriously?

31:19.714 --> 31:21.481
Anything to protect my parents.

31:22.291 --> 31:25.506
Emma, I don't want the
key to your kingdom.

31:25.865 --> 31:27.147
- [Key clatters]
- I just...

31:27.172 --> 31:28.923
I just want you to remember who you are

31:28.948 --> 31:31.949
and get you back to Storybrooke.

31:32.151 --> 31:35.519
Storybrooke? Like in my dream?

31:35.664 --> 31:37.664
How do you know of my dreams?

31:37.766 --> 31:40.060
Oh, come on, Emma.

31:40.085 --> 31:42.919
This! This is the dream!

31:43.171 --> 31:44.937
And now I have to wake you up.

31:45.373 --> 31:46.673
I know you won't believe it, Emma,

31:46.741 --> 31:50.777
so, I really am sorry about this.

31:50.879 --> 31:51.911
Emma: No!

31:51.980 --> 31:53.946
[Both gasp]

31:54.049 --> 31:55.481
[Hearts beating]

31:55.583 --> 31:57.917
I-I already gave you the kingdom.

31:57.986 --> 31:59.986
I gave you everything.
What more can I do?

32:00.055 --> 32:01.688
Be the Savior and stop me.

32:01.790 --> 32:02.755
I...

32:02.857 --> 32:06.025
If not, your parents die!

32:06.127 --> 32:07.493
I'm not a hero.

32:07.595 --> 32:09.495
I...

32:09.564 --> 32:12.465
I'm not the S... [sniffles] the Savior.

32:12.534 --> 32:14.100
Yes, you are.

32:14.169 --> 32:16.536
I know you, Emma. You
fight when it matters.

32:16.638 --> 32:18.271
You always do.

32:18.373 --> 32:22.061
Right now you need to fight!

32:22.086 --> 32:23.986
No! Please!

32:24.068 --> 32:25.755
Oh, come on, Ms. Swan!

32:25.780 --> 32:26.744
I don't know how.

32:26.769 --> 32:28.703
You don't want their blood
on their hands, do you?

32:28.750 --> 32:29.782
No.

32:29.807 --> 32:32.141
Do you?!

32:32.487 --> 32:35.388
[Crying] No. No! No!

32:36.465 --> 32:38.024
No!

32:38.126 --> 32:40.626

32:43.064 --> 32:44.897
You really don't remember, do you?

32:44.999 --> 32:46.866
[Sobs]

32:48.380 --> 32:51.315
You really couldn't fight me.

32:51.609 --> 32:55.308
She may not have fought, but I will.

32:59.481 --> 33:02.849
You murdered my grandparents,
and for that, you will pay!

33:02.917 --> 33:04.050
Oh, no, Henry, I...

33:04.152 --> 33:06.285
Henry! Henry!

33:06.354 --> 33:07.738
- It's okay, Mother.
- No.

33:07.763 --> 33:09.997
I have this.

33:12.459 --> 33:14.638
I won't hurt you, Henry.

33:14.663 --> 33:16.696
But I <i> will</i> hurt you.

33:21.236 --> 33:24.036
Emma: Henry, stop!

33:29.742 --> 33:30.977
Emma?

33:32.147 --> 33:34.213
[Sighs]

33:34.315 --> 33:36.749
You saved me.

33:36.851 --> 33:40.319
Yeah, well, you came to
this crazy land to save me,

33:40.388 --> 33:42.155
so it's only fair, right?

33:42.223 --> 33:44.357
You... remember?

33:45.559 --> 33:46.893
Yeah. I remember.

33:48.396 --> 33:50.496
When you couldn't hurt Henry,

33:51.196 --> 33:52.698
he was about to actually kill

33:52.767 --> 33:56.235
and become everything I
never wanted him to be.

33:56.337 --> 33:58.237
That's when I knew.

34:01.442 --> 34:03.075
Are they...?

34:03.144 --> 34:06.145
Oh, they're not real. I
didn't actually kill anyone.

34:07.072 --> 34:08.581
Yeah, I know.

34:08.716 --> 34:11.484
You just needed to wake me.

34:11.553 --> 34:12.918
Thank you.

34:14.489 --> 34:17.523
Although that was... very dark.

34:22.385 --> 34:26.621
Come on. Let's go stop
the real Evil Queen.

34:29.637 --> 34:32.804
This town is almost tolerable...

34:35.342 --> 34:37.909
when the peasantry is hidden away.

34:38.012 --> 34:39.679
[Whispering] Call Charming.

34:39.781 --> 34:40.847
[Loud whoosh]

34:41.333 --> 34:42.348
Portal!

34:42.449 --> 34:43.949
We've been portaled!

34:45.119 --> 34:46.319
[Sighs]

34:46.387 --> 34:48.821
Well, that was faster than I thought.

34:57.265 --> 34:59.532
Who the hell are you?

34:59.634 --> 35:01.067
[Whoosh]

35:10.545 --> 35:12.511
[Breathing heavily]

35:21.589 --> 35:23.656
[Hisses]

35:28.253 --> 35:31.098
Mother Superior was found in the forest.

35:31.123 --> 35:33.690
What happened?! Is she gonna be okay?

35:33.715 --> 35:35.415
[Gasps]

35:36.388 --> 35:37.821
Hello?

35:37.846 --> 35:40.146
Hello, tell us what happened to our son.

35:40.499 --> 35:42.299
It was dark.

35:43.512 --> 35:45.027
[Voice breaking] And I
fought as hard as I could,

35:45.052 --> 35:45.818
but she took him.

35:45.920 --> 35:47.186
Who? Who took him?

35:50.136 --> 35:51.588
The Black Fairy.

35:59.073 --> 36:00.548
Storybrooke felt like a dream.

36:00.573 --> 36:01.605
Now this does.

36:01.707 --> 36:03.741
I-I mean, a good dream.

36:04.011 --> 36:07.245
The person I was here just wasn't me.

36:07.270 --> 36:08.736
The fighting and the pain...

36:08.768 --> 36:11.869
it's... it's what makes me me.

36:11.964 --> 36:14.164
I'm good with that.

36:14.515 --> 36:16.515
Even if it means my end.

36:17.937 --> 36:19.145
[Scoffs] 'Cause, you know,

36:19.170 --> 36:21.510
that other person kind of sucked.

36:21.681 --> 36:22.980
Yeah.

36:23.042 --> 36:27.144
And singing Princess Emma
isn't my favorite model.

36:27.212 --> 36:28.478
I didn't sing...

36:29.714 --> 36:31.080
that you saw.

36:31.317 --> 36:32.416
[Chuckles]

36:32.829 --> 36:34.795
Now let's go home.

36:36.468 --> 36:38.055
Where is he?

36:38.080 --> 36:39.179
Who?

36:39.682 --> 36:42.937
Oh, I sort of made a
deal with the Dark One

36:42.962 --> 36:45.229
and let him out of his
cage for a ticket home.

36:45.289 --> 36:46.492
Regina!

36:46.517 --> 36:49.526
What if he's, like, razing
villages or something?

36:49.752 --> 36:51.691
[Laughs impishly] Well, dearie,

36:51.716 --> 36:54.072
on behalf of all
Rumplestiltskins everywhere,

36:54.097 --> 36:55.931
I'm here to make good on my word.

36:58.101 --> 37:00.268
Sure you want to leave
all this behind, Princess?

37:01.703 --> 37:03.670
Where's that bean, Rumple?

37:03.841 --> 37:05.373
As promised.

37:05.442 --> 37:07.676
Just throw it down and think
about where you want to go.

37:08.262 --> 37:09.494
Thank you.

37:09.589 --> 37:11.847
Off to raze some fake villages.

37:15.183 --> 37:17.919
[Sighs] You ready, Emma?

37:18.538 --> 37:20.055
Let's go home.

37:21.850 --> 37:24.359
David: What have I become?

37:24.394 --> 37:25.694
I wanted to execute the Evil Queen

37:25.762 --> 37:26.708
back to the Enchanted Forest,

37:26.733 --> 37:28.640
but it was Snow who
convinced me to show mercy.

37:28.665 --> 37:30.098
What if I'm just like my brother?

37:30.167 --> 37:31.967
You're not your brother, mate.

37:32.035 --> 37:34.536
We all make mistakes. It
doesn't change who we are.

37:34.571 --> 37:37.239
Now go kiss your damn wife.

37:37.341 --> 37:39.975
[Sighs]

37:40.077 --> 37:42.043
[Door opens]

37:44.078 --> 37:46.181
Perhaps...

37:46.250 --> 37:48.416
you could use a wish to
break your curse with Snow?

37:49.953 --> 37:51.103
Thank you.

37:51.158 --> 37:53.088
But the way wishes
have been going today,

37:53.156 --> 37:55.857
I think it just might make things worse.

37:56.373 --> 37:58.473
No, the lamp is yours.

37:58.518 --> 38:00.762
You're the genie's new master now.

38:00.831 --> 38:02.964
I trust that you will
be wise with this power.

38:03.635 --> 38:05.535
Thank you.

38:05.560 --> 38:07.335
And I understand the risks,

38:07.437 --> 38:11.039
but Aladdin and I... we have to try.

38:11.274 --> 38:12.968
We have to find Agrabah.

38:13.015 --> 38:14.342
Are you sure that's a good idea?

38:14.647 --> 38:15.944
Whatever the price,

38:16.046 --> 38:17.979
I owe it to my people,

38:18.048 --> 38:19.958
and I'm willing to make the sacrifice.

38:19.983 --> 38:21.716
We both are.

38:24.366 --> 38:25.631
We'll miss you.

38:25.656 --> 38:27.789
Don't. We'll be back.

38:27.891 --> 38:30.892
And until then, give
this to your mom for me.

38:30.994 --> 38:33.094
From one Savior to another.

38:35.065 --> 38:36.798
[Sighs]

38:36.867 --> 38:37.832
Do you trust me?

38:37.935 --> 38:39.701
Always, Princess.

38:41.935 --> 38:43.204
Then...

38:43.792 --> 38:46.793
I wish for you to take us to Agrabah.

38:51.949 --> 38:54.683
Rumple. The Black Fairy!

38:54.785 --> 38:56.217
Your mother!

38:56.286 --> 38:59.187
And need I remind you that
you entrusted him to that gnat?

38:59.289 --> 39:01.289
After what you did to me?!

39:01.314 --> 39:03.814
Belle, I swear,

39:04.255 --> 39:06.995
I did not dose you with that magic.

39:07.726 --> 39:09.331
I couldn't.

39:14.237 --> 39:16.805
What have we done to each other?

39:18.675 --> 39:20.742
And what have we done to our son?

39:21.678 --> 39:26.348
We have to work together
before it's too late.

39:26.857 --> 39:30.162
There are realms of dark
magic beyond even my reach,

39:30.420 --> 39:34.022
where my mother would
lurk in the shadow.

39:35.232 --> 39:37.692
Where has she taken him?

39:37.794 --> 39:39.461
I don't know.

39:39.966 --> 39:43.064
But it's a place of immense dark power.

39:43.998 --> 39:46.234
Time runs differently there.

39:47.419 --> 39:49.571
Nothing makes sense.

39:49.673 --> 39:51.606
Anything's possible.

39:51.708 --> 39:54.676
Rumple, what could happen to our son?

39:56.880 --> 39:58.646
Big trouble, team.

39:58.749 --> 40:00.915
Big trouble!

40:01.018 --> 40:02.717
What the hell is that?

40:02.819 --> 40:04.285
- That...
- [Snake hisses]

40:04.388 --> 40:07.155
is the Evil Queen.

40:07.224 --> 40:08.990
[Hissing]

40:10.372 --> 40:11.726
She got what she deserved.

40:12.576 --> 40:13.772
Who put her in there?

40:13.797 --> 40:16.231
A guy in a hood.

40:16.299 --> 40:17.966
Emma's vision. Did you see him?

40:19.970 --> 40:22.170
Did you see who was under that hood?

40:23.740 --> 40:25.340
[Bell jingles]

40:37.793 --> 40:39.326
Hello, Mother.

40:41.467 --> 40:43.400
Hello, Father.

40:55.038 --> 40:56.337
Ohh!

40:56.406 --> 40:57.839
What the...?

40:58.831 --> 41:00.464
Man: Not another step, ladies.

41:02.412 --> 41:04.312
No.

41:04.762 --> 41:06.314
It can't be.

41:06.416 --> 41:08.083
This is a robbery.

41:10.420 --> 41:12.053
Regina?

41:12.444 --> 41:13.910
Robin?

41:14.272 --> 41:16.858
Let's go! Off with the jewelry!

41:16.927 --> 41:19.160
Remember what you said. He's not real.

41:19.229 --> 41:20.328
He's not real!

41:25.569 --> 41:27.202
Robin?

41:27.741 --> 41:28.907
Regina.

41:30.404 --> 41:32.103
We've got to go!

41:34.284 --> 41:36.017
Regina!
