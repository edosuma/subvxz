00:11.248 --> 00:13.181
Previously on 24...

00:13.248 --> 00:14.681
You son of a bitch.

00:14.782 --> 00:17.317
You're behind my son's death.

00:17.385 --> 00:19.619
<i>Madame President...</i>

00:19.687 --> 00:20.554
I have your husband.

00:20.621 --> 00:21.888
You will have your forces

00:21.956 --> 00:22.989
withdrawn from around my country,

00:23.058 --> 00:25.559
Sangala, immediately and peanently.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.528
Or your husband will die a slow

00:27.595 --> 00:28.362
and certain death.

00:28.430 --> 00:30.531
I just wanted to make sure

00:30.598 --> 00:32.533
that you're still
coming to dinner tonight.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.535
Marika, I can't. I'll make it up to you.

00:34.602 --> 00:36.870
If you're looking for
rika, she's not with me.

00:36.938 --> 00:38.539
I'm looking for you, Samuel.

00:38.639 --> 00:41.007
Or whatever your real name is.

00:41.076 --> 00:43.510
Now, I don't know who you
really are, and I don't care.

00:43.545 --> 00:45.612
I just want you out of my sister's life.

00:55.323 --> 00:56.523
Keep an incident quiet

00:56.591 --> 00:58.525
until what Jack and
I are doing goes down.

00:58.593 --> 00:59.426
What incident?

00:59.494 --> 01:01.361
Vossler's dead.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.263
<i>Jack killed him at the hotel</i>

01:03.331 --> 01:04.864
on 18th and Reagan. It was seldefense.

01:04.932 --> 01:07.334
Damn it, Renee, what the hell
are you doing with this guy?

01:07.402 --> 01:09.903
You're supposed to bring
suspects in, not  murder them.

01:09.971 --> 01:11.505
Until we know who
Dubaku's source is there,

01:11.606 --> 01:13.440
you've got to hale
this outside the bureau.

01:13.508 --> 01:15.775
Dubaku is the only person
with the names of the people

01:15.843 --> 01:17.043
who betrayed you within your government

01:17.112 --> 01:18.678
It's imperative that we find him.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.647
You resigned from government service

01:20.715 --> 01:23.550
d the Senate regards you as
having been a renegade agent.

01:23.618 --> 01:27.721
How am I supposed to know
where your loyalties really lie?

01:27.788 --> 01:29.789
With all due respect, Madame President,

01:29.857 --> 01:32.058
ask around.

01:32.127 --> 01:34.228
<i>I got an address for Henry Taylor.</i>

01:40.835 --> 01:42.202
Get an ambulance!

02:00.721 --> 02:02.256
No one else gets through here.

02:02.323 --> 02:05.058
Follow me.

02:05.160 --> 02:06.826
It'senryaylor, the esident's husband,

02:06.894 --> 02:09.229
but that information is not
to be disseminated. Clear?

02:18.573 --> 02:19.506
I...

02:19.574 --> 02:20.607
Mr. Taylor, don't speak.

02:20.675 --> 02:22.075
I need you to save your energy.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.847
Over here!

02:27.915 --> 02:30.016
Excuse me. Step back, please.

02:30.084 --> 02:31.951
This is Unit Six.

02:32.019 --> 02:33.587
We have a gunshot trauma to the chest...

02:33.655 --> 02:34.588
Nine-mlimeter round.

02:34.689 --> 02:35.822
Nine
- millimeter substernal.

02:35.890 --> 02:37.291
Pulse is rapid. Are you okay?

02:37.358 --> 02:39.193
Yeah. I'm gonna call the president.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.927
I want you to search all
the rooms, see if you can get

02:40.995 --> 02:42.128
anything off their hardware

02:42.197 --> 02:43.697
that's going to tell
us where Dubaku went.

02:50.505 --> 02:51.738
This is Jack Bauer.

02:51.806 --> 02:53.173
I need to speak with the president.

02:53.241 --> 02:54.474
Hold one moment, please.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.677
<i>Madame President,</i>

02:56.744 --> 02:58.378
I uld encourage you not to lose hope.

02:58.446 --> 03:00.947
Dubaku knows we tried
to deceive him, Ethan.

03:01.015 --> 03:02.216
He has no reason to keep Henry alive.

03:03.484 --> 03:05.285
Jack Bauer is on line
one, Madame President.

03:05.353 --> 03:07.487
Put him through.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.823
Mr. Baue this is President Taylor.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.658
Madame President, we have your husband.

03:11.726 --> 03:12.892
He is alive, but he sustained

03:12.960 --> 03:15.762
a gunshot wound to the chest.

03:15.830 --> 03:17.231
How bad is it?

03:17.298 --> 03:18.398
EM Ts are stabilizing him.

03:18.466 --> 03:19.433
They're getting ready to transfer him

03:19.500 --> 03:21.000
to West Arlington spital.

03:21.068 --> 03:23.036
Mr. Bauer, be more specific.

03:23.104 --> 03:25.472
Is my husband going to be okay?

03:25.540 --> 03:27.674
We're not gonna know anything
until the doctors see him.

03:27.742 --> 03:30.143
Ma'am, I have to wn you,
he has lost a lot of blood.

03:30.211 --> 03:32.178
Jack, it's Bill. Do you have baku?

03:32.280 --> 03:34.013
Negative... he was
gone before we got here.

03:34.081 --> 03:35.148
Madameresident,

03:35.216 --> 03:36.283
since your husband was the only leverage

03:36.351 --> 03:37.851
that Dubaku had left, it's safe to say

03:37.918 --> 03:39.419
that he is trying to
lee the country now.

03:39.487 --> 03:42.356
Have you anydea how
he intends to do that?

03:42.423 --> 03:43.490
Not at this time. Unfortunately,

03:43.558 --> 03:45.058
all his men were killed
during the assault.

03:45.126 --> 03:46.593
Agent Walker and I will stay behind.

03:46.661 --> 03:48.228
We'll continue to search the area.

03:48.296 --> 03:50.230
We have to assume that
Dubaku has an exit strategy

03:50.298 --> 03:51.331
already in place.

03:51.399 --> 03:52.599
Whatever we're going to do to find him,

03:52.667 --> 03:54.401
we're going to ha to do it fast.

03:54.469 --> 03:55.402
Yes.

03:55.470 --> 03:57.571
Thank you, Mr. Bauer.

03:57.639 --> 04:00.340
Please keep me apprised on everything.

04:00.408 --> 04:01.775
Yes, ma'am.

04:01.842 --> 04:04.311
I'm sorry.

04:06.347 --> 04:09.048
I am so sorry, Madame President.

04:10.752 --> 04:12.619
Ethan, 'm going to the hospital

04:12.687 --> 04:14.854
to bwith my husband.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.523
Ma'am, that's not possib.

04:16.591 --> 04:18.625
You're exeting a military invasion.

04:18.692 --> 04:21.461
My gen erals can execute
it perfectly well witut me.

04:21.529 --> 04:23.430
We can't ignore the fact

04:23.498 --> 04:26.099
the Secret Service has been compromised

04:26.167 --> 04:28.234
The's no way we can
ensure your sAfety outside

04:28.303 --> 04:29.670
e White House. I don't give a damn.

04:29.737 --> 04:29.803
I am not going to be
held prisoner in is office

04:31.706 --> 04:33.573
Iwhile my husband is
fighting prisofor his life.ice

04:33.641 --> 04:35.241
Now, either find soone

04:35.343 --> 04:38.044
to take me to the hospital
or I'll drivthere myself.

04:38.112 --> 04:41.315
Madame President, you
know my record of service.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.283
If it's acceptable to you, I'm willing

04:43.351 --> 04:44.785
to assume responsibility
foyour security.

04:44.852 --> 04:46.787
Bill, you're no longer credentialed.

04:46.854 --> 04:48.254
You don't have the authority.

04:48.323 --> 04:50.223
Until weapture Dubaku
and interrogate him,

04:50.291 --> 04:52.258
we have no idea who in
the government is working

04:52.327 --> 04:53.259
for m.

04:53.361 --> 04:55.228
You do not know whyou can trust.

04:55.296 --> 04:57.063
But I can trust you.

04:57.131 --> 04:58.932
I brought this conspiracy
to your attention,

04:58.999 --> 05:00.500
Madame President.

05:00.568 --> 05:02.001
I would hope that I've earned it.

05:03.538 --> 05:05.405
What do you need from me?

05:05.473 --> 05:07.273
Reinstate my government clearance,

05:07.342 --> 05:09.943
allow me the authority
to vet White House staff,

05:10.010 --> 05:11.778
and allow to bring one
of my people into FBI

05:11.846 --> 05:15.281
to provide Lar Moss
with tactical support.

05:15.350 --> 05:16.750
Who is it th you want to bring in?

05:16.851 --> 05:17.984
loe O'Brian.

05:18.052 --> 05:19.619
I can vouch for her;
shs the best there is.

05:19.687 --> 05:23.289
Her clearances were also revoked
when CTU was decommissioned.

05:23.358 --> 05:25.759
Isn't there anyone capable
of handling these duties

05:25.827 --> 05:27.927
without our having to reinstate her?

05:27.995 --> 05:30.831
Someone in the Bureau
is on Dubaku's payroll.

05:30.898 --> 05:31.931
Until we find out who it is,

05:31.999 --> 05:33.166
Larry Moss can't te the chance

05:33.234 --> 05:34.200
of bringing his own people

05:34.268 --> 05:35.769
into a manhunt for Dubaku.

05:35.837 --> 05:38.572
All right.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.306
The Director of White House
Secret Service Operations

05:40.375 --> 05:42.442
is Agent Hovis.

05:42.510 --> 05:45.011
I'll order him to turn over
security protocols to you.

05:45.079 --> 05:46.613
I know Ted Hovis, Madame President.

05:46.681 --> 05:48.147
He's not gonna like
this; he's gonna fight us.

05:48.215 --> 05:49.983
Well, consering that
agents under his charge

05:50.050 --> 05:51.785
are responsible for what
happened to my husband,

05:51.853 --> 05:53.987
I don't give a damn what he likes.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.022
You have your provisional
appointment, Mr. Buchanan,

05:56.090 --> 05:57.991
under the thority of this office.

05:58.058 --> 05:59.125
Thank you, Madame President.

05:59.193 --> 06:01.127
You can thank me by
getting me to the hospital.

06:01.195 --> 06:03.096
I'll make the arrangements.

06:03.163 --> 06:04.197
Mame President...

06:04.265 --> 06:05.766
Your concerns are clear to me, Ethan,

06:05.833 --> 06:06.800
but I've made my decision.

06:06.868 --> 06:09.168
I'm only trying to do my job...

06:09.236 --> 06:10.837
looking out for your interests.

06:10.905 --> 06:14.541
My interest right now
is catching Ike Dubaku.

06:14.609 --> 06:16.976
He has killed scores of Americans today,

06:17.044 --> 06:20.380
he tried to kill my husband, and
he has corrupted our government.

06:20.448 --> 06:23.950
Whatever it takes, I want
that son of a bitch found.

06:28.255 --> 06:32.626
Marika... Marika.

06:32.693 --> 06:35.094
Samuel, what are you doing re?

06:35.162 --> 06:36.596
We nee d to talk.

06:36.664 --> 06:39.232
Uh, okay, well, I get
a break in 20 minutes.

06:39.300 --> 06:40.467
No, now.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.438
Okay, what is it?

06:44.505 --> 06:45.439
You're sring me.

06:47.241 --> 06:48.408
I need to leave the country.

06:48.476 --> 06:50.076
What?

06:50.144 --> 06:51.077
When?

06:51.145 --> 06:52.312
Right away.

06:52.379 --> 06:53.513
I don't understand.

06:53.581 --> 06:54.548
W-en are you coming back?

06:54.615 --> 06:56.215
Marika, listen to me.

06:56.283 --> 06:58.184
I ven't been entirely honest with you.

06:58.252 --> 07:00.153
My passport visa expired
a couple months ago

07:00.220 --> 07:01.855
an d I've been in the country illegally.

07:01.923 --> 07:05.826
I'm afraid the immigration
people have caught up with me.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.561
It was my sister, wasn't it?

07:07.628 --> 07:09.095
She reported you, didn't she?

07:09.163 --> 07:10.497
That doesn't matter now.

07:10.565 --> 07:12.866
What is important is I have
to leave the country tonight,

07:12.934 --> 07:14.200
anI want you to come with me.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.268
Tonight?

07:15.336 --> 07:17.604
Marika, we've talked about this.

07:17.672 --> 07:19.573
I promised you that one day I
would take you away from here,

07:19.640 --> 07:20.874
give you the happiness that you deserve.

07:20.942 --> 07:22.509
Samuel, I-I want that, too,

07:22.577 --> 07:24.811
but... but not tonight, not so soon.

07:24.879 --> 07:26.446
Marika, I don't have
time to argue with you!

07:29.183 --> 07:32.085
I'm sorry.

07:32.152 --> 07:33.720
I can't leave Rosa.

07:33.788 --> 07:36.623
She needs me; I'the only one
she has to take care of her.

07:36.691 --> 07:38.057
You know that.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.159
I know, I know.

07:40.227 --> 07:41.928
Which is why she's going to join us.

07:41.996 --> 07:42.929
Join us?

07:42.997 --> 07:44.364
As soon as possible.

07:44.431 --> 07:46.566
I could only arrange tickets
for both of us tonight,

07:46.634 --> 07:48.835
but I want you to promise
not to tell your sister

07:48.903 --> 07:50.837
of our plans, at lea not yet.

07:50.905 --> 07:52.806
I have to; I can't just run off.

07:52.874 --> 07:55.241
No, no, no, she might
cause trouble for us,

07:55.309 --> 07:57.110
make it impossible for us to leave.

07:58.345 --> 08:01.915
I promise you your sister will join us

08:01.983 --> 08:04.250
within a couple of days of our arrival.

08:04.318 --> 08:06.653
Okay? Our arrival where?

08:06.721 --> 08:07.821
Belize.

08:07.889 --> 08:09.689
I have shown you the
photographs of mhome there.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.995
Do you love me?

08:15.062 --> 08:17.697
You know I do.

08:17.765 --> 08:20.299
Then trust me.

08:20.367 --> 08:21.568
Say you'll come.

08:25.673 --> 08:27.674
I'll get my things.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.414
I still need to finalize
our arrangements.

08:34.481 --> 08:36.049
I want you to go home and pack.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.049
Wait for my call.

08:37.116 --> 08:39.753
All right.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.765
It's me.

08:51.799 --> 08:53.232
Have you made the preparations?

08:53.300 --> 08:54.534
Almost.

08:54.602 --> 08:55.936
It's been tricky
clearing a flight corridor

08:56.003 --> 08:56.069
since FAA still has st private

08:57.371 --> 08:58.905
and commercial aircraft
since FAgrounded.as st private

08:58.973 --> 09:01.041
I have faith you'll manage.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.876
The arrangements are for two passengers?

09:02.944 --> 09:04.210
Just as you requested.

09:04.278 --> 09:06.446
Are you sure you want
to leave now, Colonel?

09:06.513 --> 09:08.381
I can't imagine General
Juma will be pleased

09:08.449 --> 09:10.183
to learn that you're
abandonin your mission.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.250
The mission is  over.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.686
I have done what I can do.

09:12.753 --> 09:14.087
If that is not enough for Juma,

09:14.154 --> 09:15.689
then to hell with him.

09:15.756 --> 09:18.658
I've got your passports
and itinerary in hand.

09:18.726 --> 09:20.827
Meet me at our usual spot in half an ho.

09:20.895 --> 09:21.995
I'll bring them.

09:22.063 --> 09:25.498
No, we'll meet in the
lobby of the Roosevelt

09:25.566 --> 09:26.600
Continental Hotel.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.234
That's not a good idea.

09:28.302 --> 09:29.669
It'll be crowded there at thihour.

09:29.737 --> 09:30.804
I know.

09:30.838 --> 09:33.339
I want the meeting earlier.

09:33.407 --> 09:35.575
I' see you in 15 minutes.

09:38.779 --> 09:41.247
Go.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.250
I can't get it to boot.

09:44.318 --> 09:45.284
Hard drive must be fried.

09:45.352 --> 09:46.285
Damn it.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.354
Let's search the bodies.

09:48.422 --> 09:50.423
Start with him.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.664
Yeah.

09:57.732 --> 09:58.932
Renee, it's me.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.900
Bill Buchanan just briefed
me on your situation.

10:00.968 --> 10:02.401
What's Hen Taylor's status?

10:02.469 --> 10:03.402
They've got him in an ambulance

10:03.470 --> 10:05.005
en route to West Arlington Hospital.

10:05.072 --> 10:06.372
I don't know his current condition.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.908
Buchanan told me you and
Bauer were in a firefight.

10:08.976 --> 10:10.777
Yeah, we took down six of Dubaku's men,

10:10.845 --> 10:13.046
buDubaku was gone before we got there.

10:13.114 --> 10:14.247
You all right?

10:14.314 --> 10:16.482
I've been in worse.

10:19.654 --> 10:21.587
I'm fine, Larry.

10:21.656 --> 10:22.588
Really?

10:22.657 --> 10:24.423
I'm not so se about that.

10:24.491 --> 10:26.592
And what is that supposed to mean?

10:26.661 --> 10:30.263
I'm looking at a report
faxed to me from Metro Police.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.265
A Mrs. Carol Vossler

10:32.332 --> 10:34.367
islaiming an unidentified woman held her

10:34.434 --> 10:37.137
and her child hostage at gunpoint.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.172
Shsays the woman
threatened to kill her son.

10:39.239 --> 10:40.473
Larry, we discussed this.

10:40.541 --> 10:42.275
We needed to get Vossler to tell us

10:42.342 --> 10:43.309
where Taylor was being held.

10:43.377 --> 10:44.944
It was the only leverage we had.

10:45.012 --> 10:46.846
Yeah, right, whatever's necessary.

10:46.914 --> 10:48.247
Jack Bauer's rationalization

10:48.315 --> 10:49.949
for every unethical action he takes.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.017
It worked, Larry.

10:51.085 --> 10:52.185
Doest that count for something?

10:52.252 --> 10:53.920
Renee, Jack Bauer is
about to be strung up

10:53.988 --> 10:54.988
by a senate subcommittee,

10:55.056 --> 10:56.856
and you are following his playbook.

10:56.924 --> 10:57.891
You already got the AG's office

10:57.958 --> 10:59.092
looking into that thing youulled

10:59.160 --> 11:01.127
with Tanner's respirator, and now this.

11:01.195 --> 11:03.997
No one was actually hurt. No one...?

11:04.065 --> 11:07.133
Renee, Bauer kild the woman's husband!

11:07.201 --> 11:09.535
Renee, I swear to you,

11:09.603 --> 11:12.138
I am scared of what is happening to you.

11:12.206 --> 11:13.940
You put these people through hell

11:14.008 --> 11:15.709
and it doesn't bother you.

11:15.776 --> 11:18.078
I dn't say that it
doesn't bother me, Larry.

11:18.145 --> 11:19.478
I said that it worked.

11:19.546 --> 11:22.215
Of course it bothers me.

11:23.918 --> 11:27.286
I can see that woman's face.

11:27.354 --> 11:30.556
She and her child
staring at me with such...

11:30.624 --> 11:32.826
She had no idea that
her husband was a killer,

11:32.893 --> 11:34.094
a traitor to his country,

11:34.161 --> 11:36.763
and she looked at me
like Ias the monster.

11:36.831 --> 11:37.931
Agent Walker.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.199
Hold on.

11:39.266 --> 11:40.834
I cross-referenced the information

11:40.901 --> 11:41.968
on theseDAs.

11:42.036 --> 11:43.236
I came across some banking transactions.

11:43.303 --> 11:44.904
All from a series of accounts

11:44.972 --> 11:46.439
registered to the same address.

11:46.506 --> 11:47.540
You think it's a safe house?

11:47.608 --> 11:48.674
It's worth a shot.

11:48.743 --> 11:50.744
Larry, we may have an address on Dubaku.

11:50.811 --> 11:54.247
21917 Euclid Street.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.248
Apartment six.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.150
21917 Euclid Street, unit six.

11:57.218 --> 11:58.218
We're moving out now.

11:58.285 --> 11:59.986
Can you provide sat surveillance?

12:00.054 --> 12:01.654
Yeah, Bill Buchanan's
sending somebody over

12:01.722 --> 12:03.656
to run tech, but until
she's up and running,

12:03.724 --> 12:05.424
you're gonna have to go in blind. Okay.

12:05.492 --> 12:06.459
We'll be in touch.

12:06.526 --> 12:07.593
You sure you're okay?

12:07.661 --> 12:09.863
I'm fine.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.464
Let's go.

12:58.643 --> 13:02.012
Federal instigations continue
into the terrorist acts

13:02.080 --> 13:04.048
that have gripped the nation's capital,

13:04.115 --> 13:06.149
as well as the people of Kidron, Ohio.

13:06.217 --> 13:08.185
Despite assurances by President Taylor

13:08.252 --> 13:10.588
in her national address that the
threat has passed, Hey, honey.

13:10.655 --> 13:13.123
sources at the White
House will not confirm

13:13.191 --> 13:16.460
that all those responsible
have been accounted for.

13:19.698 --> 13:21.932
Now, are you sure you're
not gonna need my help?

13:22.000 --> 13:23.634
I'm just running FBI ops temporarily

13:23.702 --> 13:24.768
until they catch Dubaku.

13:24.836 --> 13:26.503
Once they find him,
hopefully he'll tell us

13:26.571 --> 13:27.838
the names of all the people

13:27.906 --> 13:29.673
on his payroll that are
inside our government.

13:29.741 --> 13:31.441
And then, we can go home?

13:31.509 --> 13:33.376
Then, we can go home.

13:34.412 --> 13:35.913
Well, just be careful.

13:35.981 --> 13:37.014
All right?

13:37.082 --> 13:39.249
'Cause if Buchanan's right and Dubaku

13:39.317 --> 13:40.684
has someone working inside the Bureau...

13:40.752 --> 13:42.119
I'll watch my back.

13:42.186 --> 13:43.754
You just watch Prescott.

13:48.927 --> 13:51.261
Okay, sweetheart,
Mommy has to go to work.

13:51.329 --> 13:52.896
You be good, okay?

13:52.964 --> 13:54.131
Bye, Mommy.

13:54.198 --> 13:55.165
Bye.

13:55.233 --> 13:56.266
You be good, too.

13:56.334 --> 13:57.901
I will.

13:57.969 --> 13:59.336
By

13:59.437 --> 14:03.340
And if you get all jammed
up, you know where to find me.

14:07.879 --> 14:10.014
I need you to cross-reference
our deployments with Homeland.

14:10.081 --> 14:11.581
Make sure the requisition
numbers match up.

14:11.650 --> 14:12.850
After that, you can catch up

14:12.917 --> 14:14.317
on the hourlies. Are you joki?

14:14.385 --> 14:16.319
That is busy work, administra tive cp

14:16.387 --> 14:17.587
you're handing me. Janis...

14:17.656 --> 14:19.356
I don't have the time or the inclination

14:19.423 --> 14:20.991
right now to explain
my assignments to you.

14:21.059 --> 14:22.192
Just get it done.

14:22.260 --> 14:23.493
Agent Moss, Chloe O'Brian
just cleared security.

14:23.561 --> 14:24.594
She's on her way up.

14:24.663 --> 14:25.996
All right, thank you.

14:26.064 --> 14:28.032
Janis, set up a secure VPN socket.

14:28.099 --> 14:29.399
Port it to the conference room.

14:29.467 --> 14:30.668
Why do you need a VPN socket?

14:30.735 --> 14:32.369
I'm bringing in a
consultant from Homeland

14:32.436 --> 14:33.871
to confirm there are no lingering gaps

14:33.938 --> 14:34.872
in the CIP firewall.

14:34.939 --> 14:37.074
That's fine. Take that downstairs.

14:39.077 --> 14:40.711
Ms. O'Brian, Larry Moss.

14:40.779 --> 14:42.279
Welcome to the FBI. Hi.

14:42.346 --> 14:43.547
You can calle Chloe.

14:43.614 --> 14:45.415
All right, we're right in here.

14:51.422 --> 14:53.356
Buchanan said you'd be up to speed.

14:53.424 --> 14:54.524
I'm up.

14:54.592 --> 14:55.559
Good.

14:55.626 --> 14:56.927
Agent Walker and Bauer are pursuing

14:56.995 --> 14:58.896
a potential lead on Dubaku.

15:00.098 --> 15:01.331
They're en route to this address

15:01.399 --> 15:02.499
in the Mount Pleasant District.

15:02.567 --> 15:05.368
Agent Walker's requesting
satellite support.

15:06.805 --> 15:08.739
What's the matter? Is something wrong?

15:08.807 --> 15:10.440
I'm feeling a little exposed here.

15:10.508 --> 15:12.109
If someone out there
is working for Dubaku,

15:12.177 --> 15:13.877
shouldn't we be doing
this more covertly?

15:13.945 --> 15:15.112
As far as anyone knows,

15:15.180 --> 15:16.747
you're working on
shoring up our firewall.

15:16.815 --> 15:18.415
Besides, this is the
only space available

15:18.482 --> 15:20.718
where you'll have full
access to our server.

15:20.785 --> 15:22.086
Our network doesn't
pport remote modules.

15:22.153 --> 15:23.587
That's inefficient.

15:23.654 --> 15:25.222
Whoever set your network up that way

15:25.289 --> 15:26.623
didn't know what they were doing.

15:28.659 --> 15:30.360
I set ounetwork up that way.

15:31.996 --> 15:33.496
Okay

15:43.842 --> 15:45.075
Something else?

15:45.143 --> 15:48.078
You worked with Bauer for
a long time, didn't you?

15:49.114 --> 15:50.781
Seven years, on and off.

15:51.816 --> 15:53.083
That's impressive.

15:54.518 --> 15:56.553
That you survived the experience.

15:56.621 --> 15:58.222
What are you talking about?

15:58.289 --> 16:00.257
Only that a lot of people didn't.

16:00.324 --> 16:02.425
Curtis Manning, Ryan Chapelle.

16:02.493 --> 16:03.927
His own wife.

16:05.463 --> 16:07.731
Are you saying it's Jack's
fault his wife was killed?

16:07.799 --> 16:09.099
You telle.

16:09.167 --> 16:11.334
Jack Bauer is the most trustworthy,

16:11.402 --> 16:13.170
honorable man I know,
and he's my friend.

16:13.238 --> 16:14.704
Maybe you should worry less about him

16:14.739 --> 16:16.406
and more about the mole in your office

16:16.474 --> 16:18.175
woing for Dubaku.

16:32.523 --> 16:33.991
Is that Chloe O'Brian?

16:34.058 --> 16:35.592
What? In the conference room.

16:35.660 --> 16:37.661
Chloe O'Brian...  she was senior analyst

16:37.728 --> 16:39.096
at CTU.

16:39.164 --> 16:40.730
I once took a seminashe gave.

16:40.799 --> 16:42.833
What's she doing here? Larry
said Homeland sent her over

16:42.901 --> 16:45.769
to check for residual breaches
fr the firewall attack.

16:45.837 --> 16:47.637
Huh. What?

16:47.705 --> 16:49.739
It just doesn't sound
like her area of expertise.

16:49.808 --> 16:51.108
Besides, as far as I know,

16:51.176 --> 16:53.777
she's been inactive since
CTU was decommissioned.

17:07.791 --> 17:09.960
Your passports and travel itinerary.

17:10.028 --> 17:12.662
A Hawker-Siddley 748 is
fueling at Taft Airfield.

17:12.730 --> 17:14.597
Be ready to fly within a half hour,

17:14.665 --> 17:16.532
get you to the Cayman Islands.

17:16.599 --> 17:17.599
You shouldn't have any trouble

17:17.667 --> 17:18.768
getting to Belize from there.

17:18.837 --> 17:21.038
I need a car to the
airfield and a driver.

17:21.105 --> 17:23.040
I assumed you had your
own transportation.

17:23.107 --> 17:24.674
It's not for me.

17:24.742 --> 17:25.775
I see.

17:25.844 --> 17:27.176
It's for the gir

17:28.246 --> 17:29.847
Well, m not sure I can find

17:29.914 --> 17:31.715
someone I trust on such short notice.

17:31.782 --> 17:33.083
Really?

17:34.152 --> 17:36.186
What about your man at the bar?

17:36.254 --> 17:37.654
Excuse me?

17:37.722 --> 17:39.823
Or o ne of the two on
the balcony watching now?

17:39.891 --> 17:42.059
Or the two in the black Town Car

17:42.126 --> 17:43.827
waiting for me to leave?

17:43.895 --> 17:46.330
Do you think I am a fool, Mr. Burnett?

17:46.397 --> 17:49.432
I knowou people see
me as a liability now.

17:49.500 --> 17:50.968
These men are here to guarantee

17:51.035 --> 17:52.602
your safety, Colonel,
not to threaten it.

17:52.670 --> 17:54.738
Guarantee my safety.

17:54.805 --> 17:57.140
How nice.

17:57.208 --> 17:59.609
And said with such sincerity.

18:04.582 --> 18:07.050
I want you to take this
message back with you.

18:07.118 --> 18:08.352
If anything should happen to me

18:08.419 --> 18:09.853
on my way out of t country...

18:09.921 --> 18:13.790
an accident or an assassination
attempt, anything...

18:13.858 --> 18:15.558
if the plane that you

18:15.626 --> 18:18.595
were so generous to
donate decides to explode,

18:18.662 --> 18:20.730
a data file with all the
names and bank transactions

18:20.798 --> 18:23.066
of all those involved will be
sent to the Justice Department.

18:23.134 --> 18:24.834
That is completely unnecessary.

18:24.903 --> 18:26.069
The same holds true

18:26.137 --> 18:28.038
if anything should
happen to Marika Donoso.

18:28.106 --> 18:30.707
I swear to you, she
knows nothing of this.

18:30.775 --> 18:32.276
She is no threat to you.

18:32.343 --> 18:35.078
Make sure your driver knows
this before he brings her to me.

18:35.146 --> 18:38.448
Do you understand what I am saying?

18:38.516 --> 18:40.317
I want you to tell
me that you understand

18:40.385 --> 18:42.219
what I am saying to you, so there

18:42.287 --> 18:43.220
will be no stakes.

18:43.288 --> 18:44.654
I understand.

18:44.722 --> 18:46.123
Good.

18:47.725 --> 18:49.326
The one thing I have learned

18:49.394 --> 18:53.030
in the company of mercenaries,
Mr. Burnett, ithat ultimately,

18:53.097 --> 18:55.399
they care about thing
but their own survival.

18:55.466 --> 18:57.301
Good day.

19:08.179 --> 19:09.612
I was right.

19:09.680 --> 19:12.582
Dubaku suspected wwere gonna
take him out, and apparently,

19:12.650 --> 19:14.484
he assembled evide nce to
use as an insurance policy.

19:14.552 --> 19:16.753
We need to make sure he
gets out of the country

19:16.821 --> 19:17.854
and safely into exile.

19:17.922 --> 19:19.256
Otherwise, we're all compromised.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.723
I'll make the calls.

19:25.830 --> 19:27.264
What are you doing?

19:28.399 --> 19:29.967
Rosa.

19:30.034 --> 19:31.835
Where are you going?

19:31.902 --> 19:33.203
Rosa, listen to me.

19:33.271 --> 19:34.938
We're going away from here.

19:35.006 --> 19:36.906
All of us.

19:36.975 --> 19:39.076
Well, what do you mean, all?

19:40.111 --> 19:42.346
Samuel told me the truth.

19:42.413 --> 19:45.315
He's an illegal, just like you thought.

19:45.383 --> 19:46.583
He has to leave the country,

19:46.650 --> 19:48.585
and I've agreed to go with him.

19:49.620 --> 19:51.521
You're leaving me?

19:51.589 --> 19:53.957
No, no, only for a short
time. You're gonna come, too.

19:54.025 --> 19:55.158
Samuel's made plans.

19:55.226 --> 19:56.460
We're gonna live

19:56.527 --> 19:58.161
with him in his home in Belize.

19:58.229 --> 20:00.197
Marika...

20:00.264 --> 20:01.564
he's lying to you.

20:01.632 --> 20:03.133
He's not.

20:03.201 --> 20:04.368
I won't let you do this!

20:04.435 --> 20:06.236
My God, Rosa.

20:06.304 --> 20:09.039
I have taken care of you my entire life.

20:09.107 --> 20:11.241
I've sacrificed everything for you.

20:11.309 --> 20:12.642
Why can't you let me have this?

20:12.710 --> 20:14.011
I don't trust him.

20:14.078 --> 20:15.745
Oh, well, you never ked any man

20:15.813 --> 20:17.381
who's ever shown an interest in me.

20:17.448 --> 20:19.016
Every chance I've ever had at happine,

20:19.083 --> 20:20.550
you found some way of ruining it.

20:20.618 --> 20:22.185
But not this time. Marika,

20:22.253 --> 20:23.487
I'm begging you, listen to me.

20:23.554 --> 20:24.521
No. Marika, please.

20:24.588 --> 20:25.522
Stop.

20:25.589 --> 20:26.923
Move!

20:26.991 --> 20:28.225
Marika, please.

20:28.292 --> 20:30.394
Listen to me. m begging you, Marik...

20:30.461 --> 20:31.928
FBI...  don't move!

20:31.996 --> 20:32.962
Get on your knees now!

20:33.031 --> 20:34.031
On your knees!

20:34.098 --> 20:35.598
Both of you, put your hands

20:35.666 --> 20:37.034
behind your head,
interlock your fingers.

20:37.101 --> 20:38.301
Now!

20:38.369 --> 20:39.969
Do not move.

20:42.973 --> 20:44.607
We're clear.

20:44.675 --> 20:45.942
Where is Dubaku?

20:46.010 --> 20:48.078
Who? Don't play games with me!

20:48.146 --> 20:50.347
Ike Dubaku...  we traced
bank accounts to this address.

20:50.415 --> 20:51.581
Now, where is he?

20:51.649 --> 20:54.184
We don't know who you're talking about.

20:54.252 --> 20:56.353
Let me make try and
make this easier for you.

20:56.421 --> 20:57.454
You know this man?

21:00.425 --> 21:01.624
No.

21:01.692 --> 21:02.992
You're lying to me.

21:03.061 --> 21:04.494
Why are you lying to me?!

21:06.164 --> 21:08.131
Let meee.

21:09.934 --> 21:11.768
That's him... we know him.

21:11.835 --> 21:14.037
He calls himself Aboa, Samuel Aboa.

21:14.105 --> 21:16.639
Rosa, shut up! She was
going to meet him to leave m

21:16.707 --> 21:17.874
Where we you gonna meet  him?

21:17.975 --> 21:19.276
Where were you ing?!

21:19.343 --> 21:20.610
I  don't know.

21:20.678 --> 21:23.280
How do you know him?
You work for him? No.

21:23.314 --> 21:25.748
Do you work for him? No.

21:27.685 --> 21:29.986
You know wt he's doing
here in this country?

21:33.324 --> 21:35.292
Do you have any idea...

21:35.359 --> 21:36.993
what this man is?

21:38.529 --> 21:40.464
He's everything to me.

22:10.753 --> 22:12.154
Nurse...? Mitchell.

22:12.222 --> 22:14.356
Nurse Mitchell, I'd
like to see my husband.

22:14.423 --> 22:15.757
Uh, ma'am, I...

22:15.825 --> 22:17.125
I don't know if that's possible.

22:17.193 --> 22:19.328
I was told that Dr. Schulman
will be doing the surgery.

22:19.395 --> 22:20.495
Where is he?

22:20.563 --> 22:21.796
Excuse me, Madame President.

22:21.865 --> 22:23.332
I'm Lee Schulman,
your husband's surgeon.

22:23.399 --> 22:25.934
If you come with me,
you can see him now,

22:26.002 --> 22:27.669
but you'll need to keep it brief.

22:27.737 --> 22:28.837
Thank you.

22:28.905 --> 22:30.672
You should know th Mr. Taylor's looking

22:30.740 --> 22:32.774
at a minum of five hours in surgery.

22:32.842 --> 22:34.709
The bullet lacerated
his pulmonary artery

22:34.777 --> 22:36.711
and lodged in his thoracic region.

22:36.779 --> 22:39.514
He's also suffered
massive internal bleeding.

22:39.582 --> 22:42.217
Can you offer any kind of prognosis?

22:42.285 --> 22:44.219
I'm a blunt woman, Dr. Schulman.

22:44.287 --> 22:46.255
I appreciates bluntness.

22:46.322 --> 22:49.057
His chances aren't goo ma'am.

22:49.125 --> 22:51.059
But I'll do everything I can.

22:51.127 --> 22:52.594
If you'll excuse me.

22:52.661 --> 22:54.296
I need to scrub up now.

22:54.364 --> 22:56.398
Dr. Schoenfeld, 305.

22:56.465 --> 23:00.035
Dr. Schoenfeld, 305.

23:02.171 --> 23:04.606
Henr Darling, can you hear me?

23:04.673 --> 23:05.974
Ally.

23:06.042 --> 23:08.643
Yes, sweetheart.

23:08.711 --> 23:10.578
I'm here.

23:10.646 --> 23:13.248
I'm so sorry I didn't
listen to you about Roger.

23:13.316 --> 23:14.416
You were right.

23:14.483 --> 23:15.717
It wasn't suicide.

23:15.785 --> 23:17.119
know that now.

23:17.186 --> 23:19.121
You were always right.

23:19.188 --> 23:20.855
He was a hero.

23:20.924 --> 23:22.457
Yes.

23:22.525 --> 23:25.760
He was, and so are you.

23:25.828 --> 23:28.330
I'm sorry, Madame President,

23:28.398 --> 23:30.399
but the anesthesiologist is ready now.

23:56.525 --> 23:58.460
Mr. Buanan?

23:58.527 --> 24:01.263
Yes, Madame Presiden

24:01.331 --> 24:04.766
There's something I need you to for me.

24:04.834 --> 24:08.670
Have someone find my daughter
Olivia and bring her to me.

24:09.905 --> 24:11.706
Have you had a chance to tell her?

24:13.709 --> 24:16.611
My daughter and I haven't spoken
r some time, Mr.  Buchanan.

24:16.679 --> 24:19.881
She'd never get on the phone with me.

24:23.252 --> 24:25.187
She works for a consulting firm...

24:25.254 --> 24:27.189
Martling/Norris.

24:27.256 --> 24:30.459
Do have someone
trustworthy you can send?

24:31.627 --> 24:33.661
Yes, ma'.

24:33.729 --> 24:35.730
I believe I do.

24:41.237 --> 24:43.205
And here he is again

24:43.272 --> 24:46.041
in the uniform of the Presidential Guard

24:46.109 --> 24:49.244
at the gates of the
notorious Mukatu prison.

24:49.312 --> 24:51.613
And here, inside the soccer stadium

24:51.680 --> 24:53.315
after the Barakar Massacre.

24:53.383 --> 24:55.884
The event th earned him the nickname

24:55.951 --> 24:57.452
The Butcher of Sangala.

24:57.520 --> 24:59.154
Oh, please. No more.

25:02.425 --> 25:05.727
What did you say his
real name was again?

25:05.794 --> 25:08.330
Dubaku.

25:08.398 --> 25:10.432
Ike baku.

25:13.436 --> 25:15.370
ve seen firsthand what he's capable of.

25:15.438 --> 25:17.472
I wain Africa a few months ago.

25:17.540 --> 25:19.707
He was responsible for
murdering a friend of mine.

25:19.775 --> 25:21.910
Oh, God.

25:21.977 --> 25:23.912
I know this is a shock.

25:23.979 --> 25:25.347
And I'm sorry.

25:25.415 --> 25:27.182
I really am.

25:27.250 --> 25:28.350
But here's the situation.

25:28.418 --> 25:29.951
We need your help, and we need it now.

25:31.987 --> 25:32.921
What kind of help?

25:32.988 --> 25:34.389
We need to put this man in custody

25:34.457 --> 25:35.557
before he can leave the country.

25:35.624 --> 25:37.059
Well, she already told you.

25:37.126 --> 25:38.293
She doesn't know where he is.

25:38.361 --> 25:39.794
Yeah, but you said earlier

25:39.862 --> 25:42.397
that you were going to meet him. Where?

25:42.465 --> 25:43.865
He didn't say.

25:43.966 --> 25:47.269
Just told me to go home and
pack and wait for his call.

25:47.336 --> 25:50.272
Give me your phone.

25:51.274 --> 25:53.108
Why?

25:53.176 --> 25:55.377
When he calls, I want you to answer it.

25:55.445 --> 25:56.545
No. No, no.

25:56.612 --> 25:58.246
I can't. I can't. Yes, you can.

25:58.314 --> 26:00.315
Listen to me. Just...

26:00.383 --> 26:02.217
Just-Just listen to me.

26:02.285 --> 26:04.553
It's-It's over.

26:04.620 --> 26:06.588
The man you thought you knew,

26:06.655 --> 26:08.723
the man you had feelings for...

26:08.791 --> 26:10.024
he doesn't exist.

26:10.093 --> 26:11.393
All you've been left with

26:11.461 --> 26:12.961
are his es andis betrayal.

26:16.199 --> 26:17.466
Is that him?

26:20.136 --> 26:21.236
Marika, please.

26:21.304 --> 26:23.671
All I want you to do is answer the phone

26:23.706 --> 26:26.074
and talk to him so that we can find out

26:26.142 --> 26:27.509
where he wants to meet you.

26:27.577 --> 26:29.144
Please. You can do this.

26:29.212 --> 26:30.678
Please just try.

26:37.753 --> 26:39.321
Hello.

26:39.388 --> 26:40.822
Marika?

26:40.889 --> 26:41.923
Yes.

26:41.991 --> 26:42.957
Are you all right?

26:43.025 --> 26:44.292
I'm fine.

26:44.360 --> 26:46.027
What took you so long
to answer the phone?

26:46.095 --> 26:48.130
I was in the bedroom packing.

26:48.197 --> 26:49.764
Where are you?

26:49.832 --> 26:51.299
What's wrong?

26:51.334 --> 26:52.734
You sound strange.

26:52.801 --> 26:54.102
It's... It was Rosa.

26:54.170 --> 26:55.937
She caught me packing, and we argued.

26:56.005 --> 26:58.306
Is she going to a problem for us?

26:58.374 --> 26:59.608
No.

26:59.675 --> 27:01.176
m sorry, Samuel.

27:01.244 --> 27:02.977
I hato tell her everything.

27:03.045 --> 27:04.513
It was the only way.

27:04.580 --> 27:06.681
But, uh... bushe understands now.

27:06.749 --> 27:08.350
Are you certain?

27:08.417 --> 27:10.118
ah. Yeah, she's fine.

27:10.186 --> 27:12.154
Now that she knows she and
I will be together again

27:12.221 --> 27:13.821
in a few days.

27:13.889 --> 27:15.857
She should thank heaven

27:15.924 --> 27:18.160
she has such an angel for a sister.

27:18.227 --> 27:19.461
Are you ready to go?

27:19.529 --> 27:20.728
Almost.

27:20.796 --> 27:21.896
Hurry up then.

27:21.964 --> 27:22.997
I've had a car sent for you.

27:23.065 --> 27:24.599
It should be there very shortly.

27:24.667 --> 27:26.401
Go downstairs and wait for it.

27:26.469 --> 27:28.036
Where is it taking me?

27:28.103 --> 27:30.372
Don't worry. The driver will know.

27:30.439 --> 27:32.207
I just want the woman I love

27:32.275 --> 27:34.643
to get downstairs as quickly possible.

27:34.710 --> 27:36.844
Okay.

27:41.384 --> 27:43.585
It's all right. It's all right.

27:43.653 --> 27:44.752
You did great.

27:44.820 --> 27:46.188
Did we get the rendezvous point?

27:46.255 --> 27:48.190
No. He's sending a car with a driver.

27:48.257 --> 27:49.857
Come here.

27:57.900 --> 27:59.834
There's no one on the street yet.

27:59.902 --> 28:01.002
We could grab the driver,

28:01.070 --> 28:02.504
get him to tell us Dubaku's location.

28:02.572 --> 28:04.172
There's no guarantee
we ca get him to talk.

28:04.240 --> 28:05.840
And if we take too
long, Dubaku's not gonna

28:05.908 --> 28:07.809
wait around. So then what do we do?

28:12.014 --> 28:14.182
We can get her to go meet with him.

28:14.250 --> 28:16.284
What? We could track her.

28:16.352 --> 28:18.086
We could use her cell
phe as a transponder.

28:18.153 --> 28:20.922
You want to send that girl to Dubaku?

28:20.989 --> 28:22.224
We don't have another choice.

28:22.291 --> 28:23.725
Jack. You want to get Dubaku,

28:23.792 --> 28:25.126
this is our shot.

28:30.533 --> 28:32.567
Marika?

28:34.704 --> 28:37.138
I have a favor to ask of you.

28:37.206 --> 28:39.140
We can't make you do this.

28:39.208 --> 28:42.043
But when the car arrives,
we would like you to go

28:42.111 --> 28:44.646
with the driver so that we
could follow you back to Dubaku.

28:44.714 --> 28:46.381
Oh, what-what are you talking about?

28:46.449 --> 28:48.316
You want her to go to him and face him?

28:48.384 --> 28:50.818
It's the only chance we
have of finding him before

28:50.886 --> 28:52.854
he disappears forever. I'll do it.

28:53.956 --> 28:55.490
- I'll do it.
- No!

28:55.558 --> 28:57.158
I'm your older ster,

28:57.226 --> 28:58.760
and I won't allow it.

28:58.827 --> 29:00.762
It's not your decision to make, Rosa.

29:00.829 --> 29:02.797
It's mine.

29:04.367 --> 29:06.434
Anit's the right thing to do.

29:07.803 --> 29:09.504
Let me see your phone.

29:13.643 --> 29:14.842
What are you doing?

29:14.910 --> 29:16.177
Getting your SID number.

29:16.279 --> 29:18.012
It's how we're going to track you.

29:18.080 --> 29:19.748
You're not gonna be out there alone.

29:19.815 --> 29:21.349
Agent Walker and I
will be following you.

29:21.417 --> 29:23.117
We'll never be more than a mile behind.

29:23.185 --> 29:25.320
As soon as you reach the destination...

29:25.388 --> 29:26.655
that's when we'll move in.

29:26.722 --> 29:28.256
Marika.

29:28.324 --> 29:30.191
A mile! Are you crazy?

29:30.259 --> 29:31.726
Rosa, enough.

29:31.794 --> 29:33.295
You heard what he said.

29:33.362 --> 29:34.729
He's a murderer!

29:34.797 --> 29:36.498
He could hurt you. He won't.

29:36.565 --> 29:40.034
Rosa, I should have liened to you.

29:40.102 --> 29:42.136
Sweetheart.

29:42.204 --> 29:43.772
You warned me about him.

29:43.839 --> 29:45.540
Listen, the only reason

29:45.608 --> 29:48.343
why I said those things
was because I was jealous.

29:48.411 --> 29:50.679
And I dn't want to lose you.

29:52.915 --> 29:54.449
Larry, it's Jack.

29:54.517 --> 29:56.518
Renee said you had someone
running operations support?

29:56.585 --> 29:57.752
Yeah. She's right here.

29:57.820 --> 29:59.053
I'll put you on speaker.

30:00.323 --> 30:01.456
Jack, it's Chloe.

30:01.524 --> 30:02.757
Chloe. CHLOE: What do you need?

30:02.825 --> 30:04.058
How long's it gonna take you

30:04.126 --> 30:06.194
to set up a SAT beacon
for a mobile line?

30:06.261 --> 30:07.562
Usually a few seconds,

30:07.630 --> 30:09.331
but with the backward way
they have the system set up,

30:09.398 --> 30:10.665
it's gonna take at least a few minutes.

30:10.733 --> 30:12.701
Okay, well, let me
give you the SID number.

30:12.768 --> 30:15.903
1-C-4-8-6-8-9.

30:15.971 --> 30:17.305
You got it?

30:17.373 --> 30:18.506
Got it.

30:18.574 --> 30:19.907
Jack, who are you tracking?

30:19.975 --> 30:21.576
A woman who's involved with Dubaku.

30:21.644 --> 30:23.745
He's sending a car to take her to him.

30:23.813 --> 30:24.979
She's one of his operatives?

30:25.047 --> 30:26.381
No.

30:26.449 --> 30:28.550
It's-It's mo complicated than that.

31:05.279 --> 31:07.313
Arthur, you're not
going toind another firm

31:07.381 --> 31:08.882
that's done more
high-level consulting work

31:08.950 --> 31:10.416
for a relatively small
pharmaceutical company

31:10.484 --> 31:11.718
like yours.

31:11.786 --> 31:14.054
Remember, my firm helped
the governor craft a plan

31:14.122 --> 31:16.156
to swap property taxes for sales taxes

31:16.224 --> 31:17.824
in h last budget reform.

31:17.892 --> 31:19.826
Tell me that didn't save
Dexter-Carr a bundle.

31:19.894 --> 31:21.828
Oh, it did, Olivia.

31:21.896 --> 31:24.064
But since I'm specifically
looking to hire you,

31:24.132 --> 31:26.266
I need to know what you yourself can do.

31:26.333 --> 31:27.667
Whatever you need.

31:27.735 --> 31:29.669
You know my accomplishments,
yove seen my resume.

31:29.737 --> 31:32.672
I mean White House influence.

31:32.740 --> 31:34.607
Considering your family.

31:34.675 --> 31:36.777
We're not lobbyists, Arthur.

31:36.844 --> 31:39.012
It states that clearly in the contract.

31:39.080 --> 31:41.648
I just thought, since you
had the president's ear...

31:41.715 --> 31:42.849
I don't.

31:42.917 --> 31:44.550
Is that going to be a problem?

31:44.618 --> 31:45.786
Excuse me, Ms. Taylor?

31:47.421 --> 31:49.355
Do know you?

31:49.423 --> 31:51.557
My name is Aaron Pierce.

31:51.625 --> 31:54.194
Your office told me you'd be here.

31:54.262 --> 31:56.562
I've been dispatched at the
request of the president.

31:56.630 --> 31:58.899
Yo credentials say you've
retired, Mr. Pierce.

31:58.966 --> 32:00.901
Perhaps no one informed you

32:00.968 --> 32:02.936
I refused Secret Service
protection months ago.

32:03.004 --> 32:04.470
I'm aware of that, ma'am.

32:04.538 --> 32:06.506
This is a special rcumstance.

32:06.573 --> 32:09.542
Well, as you can see, I'm
a little busy right now.

32:09.610 --> 32:10.743
This isn't a good time.

32:10.812 --> 32:12.445
I'm sorry, but I have to insist.

32:12.513 --> 32:14.547
It's really... It's all right. No.

32:14.615 --> 32:16.549
No, it's not all right.

32:16.617 --> 32:18.451
What is it that's so impornt

32:18.519 --> 32:21.888
for my mother to steal me away
while I'm trying to do business?

32:21.956 --> 32:23.723
I'm not at liberty to say, ma'am.

32:23.791 --> 32:25.391
That information is confidential.

32:25.459 --> 32:28.128
Olivia, we can pick
this up at a later time.

32:28.196 --> 32:29.462
Arthur, wait...

32:29.530 --> 32:31.531
We'll be in touch.

32:34.368 --> 32:36.236
Ma'am, please?

32:36.304 --> 32:37.737
I'm not going anywhere with you

32:37.805 --> 32:39.772
until you tell me what this is about.

32:40.875 --> 32:43.810
'sour father, Ms. Taylor.

32:43.878 --> 32:46.546
He's been shot.

32:46.613 --> 32:48.548
He's in surgery at
West Arlington Hospital.

32:48.615 --> 32:50.550
Your mother's there now.

32:50.617 --> 32:53.253
None of this is public knowledge.

32:54.288 --> 32:56.422
My God, I...

32:56.490 --> 32:59.092
My car is just outside.

32:59.160 --> 33:01.161
Uh-huh.

33:06.667 --> 33:08.268
Excuse me, Sean.

33:08.336 --> 33:10.636
Can I please get the digital
beta key for the server?

33:10.704 --> 33:12.405
Why?

33:12.473 --> 33:14.407
Larry asked for it.

33:14.475 --> 33:15.842
mething to do with
the firewall asssment.

33:15.910 --> 33:18.411
If Larry wants it, why
esn't he come to me?

33:18.479 --> 33:19.645
I don't know.

33:21.682 --> 33:24.084
Maybe I oughto go ask him. No.

33:25.086 --> 33:27.020
Okay.

33:27.088 --> 33:29.522
I think that Larry
brought in this woman,

33:29.590 --> 33:30.656
Chloe O'Brian, to replace me.

33:30.724 --> 33:31.824
And I just want toet a bead

33:31.893 --> 33:32.859
on what they're working on.

33:32.927 --> 33:34.594
That's all. That's all?

33:34.661 --> 33:36.329
That's enough to lose us both our jobs.

33:36.397 --> 33:39.632
Well, maybe I should
stop covering for you.

33:39.700 --> 33:41.434
What are you talking about?

33:41.502 --> 33:42.602
Erika

33:42.669 --> 33:44.271
and you, and your little
sexual indiscretions.

33:44.338 --> 33:47.007
I've said nothing to Larry or your wife.

33:47.074 --> 33:48.875
I'm sure you'd like
me to keep it that way.

34:13.634 --> 34:15.969
You're a ltle bitch, you know that?

34:16.036 --> 34:18.038
Yore a little bitc h.

34:25.279 --> 34:27.213
Okay, Jack. The link's
up, I've got the signal.

34:27.281 --> 34:29.715
Copy that. I'll get back to you.

34:30.751 --> 34:32.752
We're on.

34:38.092 --> 34:39.559
Marika...

34:39.626 --> 34:41.627
we got to go.

34:44.098 --> 34:45.966
It's all right.

34:51.339 --> 34:53.106
You...

34:53.174 --> 34:55.108
FBI.

34:55.176 --> 34:57.444
You keep her safe, you hear me?

34:57.511 --> 34:59.512
We will.

35:08.822 --> 35:10.756
I'm really scared.

35:10.824 --> 35:11.924
You're going to be fine.

35:11.993 --> 35:13.293
Just remember, we're right behind you.

35:13.361 --> 35:14.394
Move up here.

35:16.430 --> 35:18.264
Now, listen, if you get into trouble,

35:18.332 --> 35:20.100
you can signal us by
dialing one-zero... No.

35:20.167 --> 35:21.734
No, I don'want you to do that.

35:21.802 --> 35:23.036
Don't do anything that's going to raise

35:23.104 --> 35:25.071
the suspicion of the driver. Okay.

35:25.139 --> 35:27.073
You ready?

35:27.141 --> 35:28.074
I'm ready. Yeah.

35:28.142 --> 35:29.075
Okay. Okay.

35:29.143 --> 35:31.144
Okay.

35:38.619 --> 35:40.053
What the hell are you doing?

35:40.121 --> 35:42.088
She was scared.

35:42.156 --> 35:43.523
I wanted her to know
there was another opon

35:43.590 --> 35:45.025
than waiting for us to swoop in.

35:45.092 --> 35:47.660
If we're going to find Dubaku,
there are no other oions,

35:47.728 --> 35:49.095
you understand?

35:49.163 --> 35:50.630
Come on, you've run
operations like this.

35:50.697 --> 35:51.731
Not without fu tactical support,

35:51.798 --> 35:52.965
and at least two backup
units on the scene.

35:53.034 --> 35:55.101
She's naked out there,
Jack. I don't like it.

35:55.169 --> 35:56.369
This isn't about you.

35:56.437 --> 35:59.272
Thiss about her and Dubaku

35:59.340 --> 36:01.307
Listen, life gets ugly,

36:01.375 --> 36:03.309
innocent people get
hurt... that's a reality.

36:03.377 --> 36:05.345
At least she got to make a choice

36:05.413 --> 36:06.612
to be involved, to do the righthing.

36:06.680 --> 36:07.847
Which is a lot more

36:07.915 --> 36:09.516
than I can say for
Dubaku's other victims.

36:09.583 --> 36:12.085
We have one job here...
that's to get Dubaku.

36:12.153 --> 36:13.486
Outside of that don't@get involved.

36:16.790 --> 36:18.724
Chloe, the car's here.

36:18.792 --> 36:20.793
CHLOE: Copy that.

36:26.934 --> 36:29.202
She's getting in the car.

36:29.270 --> 36:31.237
Co.

36:37.278 --> 36:38.378
She's moving.

36:38.446 --> 36:39.645
Are you locked in?

36:39.713 --> 36:42.348
Yeah, I've got them
heading south on 14th.

36:43.551 --> 36:45.318
Can you upload the tracking grid

36:45.386 --> 36:46.519
to Agent Walker's PDA?

36:46.587 --> 36:48.088
No, I'll have to direct you.

36:48.155 --> 36:50.090
Just keep us close. Understood.

36:50.157 --> 36:52.024
Head towards 14th, make a right.

36:52.093 --> 36:53.593
Copy that.

37:41.555 --> 37:42.522
How much further?

37:54.194 --> 37:56.863
Continuing west on R Street,
crossing Hampshire Avenue.

37:56.931 --> 37:58.798
You're less than a mile
behind the target car.

37:58.866 --> 38:01.000
Copy that.

38:01.068 --> 38:03.035
Target car is turning,

38:03.103 --> 38:04.604
left on Connecticut.

38:04.672 --> 38:06.706
Okay, rounding Dupont Circle.

38:06.774 --> 38:09.208
Agent Moss, is there anything
in the northern quad of the grid

38:09.276 --> 38:11.077
that would indicate where
Dubaku can hide a plane

38:11.144 --> 38:12.345
or a helicopter? MOSS: No.

38:12.412 --> 38:13.613
Nothing finitive.

38:13.681 --> 38:15.381
Could be any number of launch sites.

38:18.218 --> 38:19.385
What was it? What happened?

38:21.755 --> 38:23.723
Jack, we've got a problem.

38:23.791 --> 38:24.757
Chloe, what's wrong?

38:24.825 --> 38:26.826
We just lost the tracking grid.

38:26.894 --> 38:27.927
What?! I-I don't know.

38:27.995 --> 38:29.028
It just suddenly glitched out.

38:29.096 --> 38:30.262
We can't afford to lose them.

38:30.330 --> 38:31.898
Jack, I gave this woman
my word we'd protect her.

38:31.966 --> 38:33.500
I know. Chloe, get it back up.

38:33.567 --> 38:35.067
We're doing our best, here, Jack.

38:35.135 --> 38:37.436
Wait.

38:37.505 --> 38:39.005
It's back up.

38:39.072 --> 38:40.239
What the hell happened?

38:40.307 --> 38:42.341
I don't know, I'm running
a diagnostic right now.

38:42.409 --> 38:43.843
Jack, they're moving southeast

38:43.911 --> 38:45.177
on Massachusetts Avenue.

38:45.245 --> 38:46.513
You've closed the gap
to about a half mile.

38:46.580 --> 38:47.847
You may want to back off a little bit.

38:47.915 --> 38:48.948
Okaycopy that.

38:49.016 --> 38:50.349
Oh, no.

38:50.417 --> 38:51.784
What?

38:51.852 --> 38:53.185
Somebody was in the system.

38:53.253 --> 38:54.554
What? What are you talking about?

38:54.622 --> 38:56.222
I'm saying someone in this office

38:56.289 --> 38:57.557
was mirroring my terminal.

38:57.625 --> 38:59.492
Whoever it was knows
exactly what we were doing.

39:07.367 --> 39:09.569
Can you backtrace the breach?

39:09.637 --> 39:11.604
No. The link was severed.

39:11.672 --> 39:12.939
It could have come from anywhere.

39:17.845 --> 39:19.245
Jack, yogetting this?

39:19.312 --> 39:21.714
It looks like we might
have a security breach.

39:21.782 --> 39:23.282
Someone is mirroring our comm.

39:23.350 --> 39:25.084
Jack, they're coming from all sides.

39:26.620 --> 39:28.555
Larry, we got a situation here.

39:28.622 --> 39:30.089
I got Metro PDs What's going on?

39:30.157 --> 39:32.091
trying to build a roadblock around us.

39:32.159 --> 39:33.325
What?

39:33.393 --> 39:35.161
Why would they be doing that?

39:35.228 --> 39:37.396
I don't know. Just get 'em off us!

39:49.076 --> 39:50.743
Larry, do something!

39:50.811 --> 39:52.011
This is Agent Moss.

39:52.079 --> 39:53.279
Connect me with Metro District Command.

39:53.346 --> 39:55.114
Hands in the air! Hands in the air!

39:55.182 --> 39:56.148
My name is Jack Bauer,

39:56.216 --> 39:57.951
my passenger

39:58.018 --> 39:59.085
is a Federal Agent.

39:59.152 --> 40:00.653
Get out ofhe car right now!

40:01.889 --> 40:03.122
Federal agent!

40:03.190 --> 40:04.457
She's a federal agent!

40:04.524 --> 40:07.259
Put your hands behind your back, sir.

40:08.996 --> 40:11.163
Come on, Larry, do something!

40:11.231 --> 40:13.165
Captain, you've got to release
these people immediately!

40:13.233 --> 40:15.334
No. No, that is a mistak

40:15.402 --> 40:17.604
No Federal warrants have
been issued for them!

40:17.671 --> 40:19.005
Yes, they have.

40:19.073 --> 40:20.640
A warrant was called in for the vehicle.

40:20.708 --> 40:22.174
"Occupants armed and dangerous,

40:22.242 --> 40:23.610
to be apprehended with decisive force."

40:23.677 --> 40:24.711
Issued by whom?

40:24.778 --> 40:26.613
FBI. There's no attribution,

40:26.680 --> 40:27.747
but the routing code's real.

40:27.815 --> 40:31.183
This was definitely
done by someone here.

40:31.251 --> 40:33.686
Marika's car just turned
east onto N Street.

40:33.754 --> 40:35.154
Captain, listen carelly.

40:35.222 --> 40:37.156
I'm the Special Agent in
charge of this operation,

40:37.224 --> 40:39.191
and I am revoking these
warrants immediately.

40:39.259 --> 40:40.693
No.

40:40.761 --> 40:43.162
No, I don't have time to
deal withour chain of command.

40:43.230 --> 40:45.231
You need to release
these people right now!

40:48.435 --> 40:50.402
Hey. Thank you.

40:50.470 --> 40:52.404
So is O'Brian here to replace you?

40:52.472 --> 40:53.840
I don't know. No.

40:53.907 --> 40:55.642
Larry's using her for some kind of

40:55.743 --> 40:57.644
covert operation with Jack Bauer.

40:57.711 --> 40:59.245
They're tracking a car to Dubaku.

40:59.312 --> 41:01.313
Why would he keep us in
the dark about something

41:01.381 --> 41:02.649
like that? I don't know.

41:02.716 --> 41:04.951
I don't know, but I don't like it.

41:16.864 --> 41:18.597
Hey, I took care of Bauer and Walker.

41:18.666 --> 41:19.832
They're pinned down.

41:19.900 --> 41:22.401
Why am I being brought
in on this so last minute?

41:22.469 --> 41:24.436
Moss is running this Op on his own.

41:24.504 --> 41:26.673
It took me some time

41:26.740 --> 41:28.675
to tap into his phone line.

41:28.742 --> 41:30.242
He's on with Metro right now.

41:30.310 --> 41:32.244
Can you at least disable
the tracking signal

41:32.312 --> 41:33.546
they're using to follow the girl?

41:33.613 --> 41:35.114
No, not from my console.

41:35.182 --> 41:36.949
But judging by the
frequency, they're using

41:37.017 --> 41:38.217
her cell as the traker.

41:38.251 --> 41:39.218
All right.

41:39.286 --> 41:40.519
Good work.

41:40.587 --> 41:44.123
You told me that once
Dubaku served his purpose,

41:44.191 --> 41:45.224
you'd take him out.

41:45.292 --> 41:46.793
Why are we still helping him?

41:46.860 --> 41:49.128
He's thrtening to expose us
using the database he's kept

41:49.196 --> 41:50.897
with nes and accounts
of everyone involved.

41:52.933 --> 41:54.767
Including mine?

41:54.835 --> 41:55.968
I mean, everyone.

41:56.036 --> 41:57.236
We don't know where the file is,

41:57.304 --> 41:59.572
so you just tter pray
that he gets awa y.

42:09.950 --> 42:12.018
Yes, it has to do with
the terrorist threats

42:12.086 --> 42:14.486
that happened this morning.

42:25.833 --> 42:26.833
Hello?

42:26.900 --> 42:27.900
You got a problem.

42:27.968 --> 42:29.135
What is it?

42:29.203 --> 42:31.237
Your girlfriend's
been turned by the FBI.

42:31.304 --> 42:33.072
I don't believe you.

42:33.140 --> 42:34.741
They met with her lf hour ago,

42:34.808 --> 42:36.109
told her who you really are.

42:36.176 --> 42:37.910
That's impossible.

42:37.978 --> 42:39.078
Marika would never do this.

42:39.146 --> 42:40.947
I got it from our
source inside the Bureau,

42:41.014 --> 42:41.981
it is definite.

42:42.049 --> 42:43.515
She agreed to lead them to you,

42:43.583 --> 42:45.451
using her cell phone as a tracker.

42:45.518 --> 42:46.685
Look, my source managed

42:46.754 --> 42:48.320
to stall their surveillance
team for a while,

42:48.388 --> 42:50.489
but you need to get to
the airfield immediately.

42:50.557 --> 42:51.958
I'll call my driver,

42:52.025 --> 42:53.226
have him take care of her.

42:53.293 --> 42:55.061
No. I'll do it.

42:55.129 --> 42:57.663
Colonel, I told you,
they are tracking her.

42:57.731 --> 42:58.998
If you let her come to you,

42:59.066 --> 43:00.432
you're risking your chances of escape.

43:00.500 --> 43:03.435
I said, I'll take care of her!

43:03.500 --> 43:05.435
