00:43.509 --> 00:46.579
<i>Thank you for joining us
on such short notice, Mr. President.</i>

00:46.612 --> 00:48.514
Of course.

00:48.546 --> 00:51.516
Reports of a government-funded
weapons program, X-Corp,

00:51.549 --> 00:52.851
have been making the headlines.

00:52.884 --> 00:56.555
Can you confirm or deny
the recent allegations?

00:56.588 --> 01:01.094
Well, as you know, homeland
security has been our top priority,

01:01.127 --> 01:03.795
and yes. Yes, we have been
working together with X-Corp,

01:03.829 --> 01:08.134
along with other developers, all in
an effort to protect the people.

01:08.167 --> 01:11.471
Is it true that X-Corp has lost
control of its operating system?

01:12.871 --> 01:15.507
There was a slight glitch.

01:15.540 --> 01:17.109
But I can assure you,

01:17.143 --> 01:19.745
our team of experts
are working to resolve this issue.

01:19.778 --> 01:21.218
How many casualties were there?

01:22.781 --> 01:25.251
Those reports have yet
to be confirmed.

01:25.284 --> 01:27.487
Can you give us
a ballpark figure?

01:27.519 --> 01:30.355
Our main focus right now
is resolving this issue.

01:30.388 --> 01:33.259
Should we be expecting
another attack in the near future?

01:35.227 --> 01:37.230
I have no further comment.
Thank you.

01:42.233 --> 01:44.603
<i>Disturbing news out
of Washington today.</i>

01:44.637 --> 01:47.772
- Classified weapons manufacturer X-Corp...
- X-Corp.

01:47.805 --> 01:49.441
Top-secret weapons program

01:49.474 --> 01:51.409
has lost control.

01:51.442 --> 01:53.445
<i>Number of casualties
yet to be released.</i>

01:53.478 --> 01:55.381
Jack Kilmore, missing.

01:55.414 --> 01:57.450
<i>CEO Jack Kilmore believed dead.</i>

01:57.483 --> 01:58.784
<i>More details beginning to surface.</i>

01:58.816 --> 02:00.385
They made weapons.

02:00.418 --> 02:02.888
Weapons they didn't want you
to know they were making.

02:02.921 --> 02:04.423
<i>Spy crafts.</i>

02:04.456 --> 02:06.192
Nuclear projectiles.

02:06.224 --> 02:07.559
<i>Spider drones.</i>

02:07.593 --> 02:10.496
The transmitter has a needle poin
that enters the nervous system,

02:10.527 --> 02:12.764
allowing complete control
of the host.

02:12.798 --> 02:15.334
<i>Remote-controlled humans.</i>

02:15.366 --> 02:17.637
Half-man, half-machine
experiments.

02:17.669 --> 02:19.571
<i>AKA Cyborgs.</i>

02:19.604 --> 02:21.941
Experts claiming
another attack possible.

02:21.973 --> 02:25.510
Experts unwilling to
rule out another attack.

02:25.544 --> 02:27.914
When and where the attacks
may occur...

02:27.947 --> 02:30.883
Still not sure who or what.

02:30.915 --> 02:34.287
The real question is,
why aren't we already dead?

02:49.634 --> 02:52.204
A second wave of attacks
now underway.

02:52.237 --> 02:54.873
Authorities have issued
a state of emergency.

02:54.907 --> 02:57.276
<i>Stay inside and seek shelter.</i>

02:57.308 --> 02:58.776
Do not leave your home.

02:58.811 --> 03:00.780
<i>This technology had
no place in our society.</i>

03:00.812 --> 03:02.948
<i>A war we can't win.</i>

03:02.981 --> 03:05.651
All major cities believed
to be targets.

03:05.683 --> 03:07.853
<i>Paris, New York, Beijing...</i>

03:07.885 --> 03:10.823
<i>- Berlin...
- Tokyo, Los Angeles, Moscow.</i>

03:10.855 --> 03:13.491
<i>The extent of damages
is yet to be confirmed,</i>

03:13.525 --> 03:15.561
<i>but it is believed
there are numerous casualties.</i>

03:15.593 --> 03:17.362
I'm losing the teleprompter.

03:22.300 --> 03:24.302
We're cutting in and out.

03:24.336 --> 03:26.239
<i>We ask that you
stay patient with us</i>

03:26.271 --> 03:29.341
<i>as we work to uncover
any additional details.</i>

03:50.342 --> 03:53.742
Subrip by DanDee

04:06.512 --> 04:09.649
<i>The reports said this would
be the war to end all wars.</i>

04:09.681 --> 04:12.617
<i>They said X-Corp
was too powerful.</i>

04:12.651 --> 04:15.021
<i>That nothing could
stop its artillery.</i>

04:15.054 --> 04:17.490
<i>For once, the reports
were right.</i>

04:17.523 --> 04:21.494
<i>After the initial strikes, only a few
of us were lucky enough to survive.</i>

04:21.526 --> 04:24.362
<i>We would go on to be hunted
by X-Corp ground units,</i>

04:24.396 --> 04:27.900
<i>an army of fighter drones and Cyborgs.
Half-man, half-machine.</i>

04:27.932 --> 04:30.903
<i>Slaves now controlled
by the system.</i>

04:30.935 --> 04:33.305
<i>After a year of hiding
underground like rats,</i>

04:33.338 --> 04:35.975
<i>we began facing
a new enemy as well,</i>

04:36.007 --> 04:37.342
<i>hunger.</i>

04:38.343 --> 04:39.846
<i>One thing soon became clear.</i>

04:44.415 --> 04:46.819
<i>The lucky ones
are already dead.</i>

06:13.439 --> 06:15.007
<i>Like I said,</i>

06:15.040 --> 06:16.776
<i>the lucky ones
were already dead.</i>

07:54.572 --> 07:55.608
Go!

08:32.644 --> 08:33.879
No!

10:19.116 --> 10:20.285
Is your mom feeling better?

10:21.352 --> 10:22.654
No.

10:31.028 --> 10:32.748
Where did, uh...
Where did you get this?

10:35.033 --> 10:36.635
This shit for real, Lieutenant?

10:37.302 --> 10:39.805
We have got dates,

10:39.837 --> 10:43.741
locations, transactions, profiles...
It's definitely legit.

10:43.774 --> 10:44.776
Wait, go back.

10:47.278 --> 10:51.216
Amy Kilmore, original co-founder,
second in command of operations.

10:51.249 --> 10:52.817
His sister.

10:52.850 --> 10:56.288
Killed July 4th, 2017.
That's day one.

10:56.321 --> 10:57.855
This thing is unbelievable.

10:57.889 --> 10:59.892
It was him. It was Kilmore.

11:01.192 --> 11:02.293
All right, we gotta
move now. We want...

11:02.326 --> 11:03.828
Slow down, Lieutenant.

11:03.861 --> 11:05.264
Slow down?

11:05.297 --> 11:07.417
We've managed to survive
this long for a reason.

11:08.299 --> 11:10.234
We stay off their radar.

11:10.268 --> 11:11.003
Colonel...

11:11.004 --> 11:11.737
Wizkowski?

11:11.769 --> 11:13.072
Yes, sir.

11:13.105 --> 11:16.241
Search that drive. Let me know
if you find any shit we can use.

11:21.846 --> 11:23.314
Colonel.

11:23.347 --> 11:24.849
I don't want to hear it.

11:24.883 --> 11:26.884
Colonel, you're making
a mistake.

11:26.918 --> 11:28.721
Are you questioning
my authority, Lieutenant?

11:28.754 --> 11:30.322
If he's still alive, then we still
have a chance...

11:30.355 --> 11:31.423
We can't risk it.

11:31.456 --> 11:33.057
Risk what?

11:33.091 --> 11:34.826
We're out of food,
supplies are down.

11:36.260 --> 11:38.163
We need to stop hiding
and start fighting.

11:40.499 --> 11:42.468
It's a risk we have to take,
and you know it.

11:47.038 --> 11:48.407
All right.

11:48.440 --> 11:52.011
But if we do this, we do
it my way. Understood?

11:53.110 --> 11:54.480
Understood.

11:54.513 --> 11:57.383
I run the show. Not you.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.019
Yes, sir.

12:02.988 --> 12:05.157
We're trying to survive here.
One day at a time.

12:05.956 --> 12:07.092
Remember that.

12:17.802 --> 12:21.373
18, 19...

12:21.405 --> 12:22.741
Come on, get it.

12:25.976 --> 12:27.779
<i>Not bad, Lopez.</i>

12:29.147 --> 12:30.449
Very good.
Good job!

12:30.481 --> 12:32.283
Not great, but not bad.

12:35.019 --> 12:37.122
<i>Rise and shine, shit-stain.</i>

12:41.225 --> 12:42.528
Son of a bitch.

12:42.561 --> 12:45.096
Looks like we're getting
soft around here.

12:45.129 --> 12:46.865
Lopez,

12:46.898 --> 12:48.267
are we getting soft
around here?

12:48.299 --> 12:49.267
No, sir.

12:49.268 --> 12:50.234
Good.

12:50.268 --> 12:51.937
We don't got time for that.

12:51.970 --> 12:54.306
What we do got is
a situation on our hands,

12:54.339 --> 12:56.175
one that requires
immediate attention.

12:57.174 --> 12:58.414
You sending us out, Colonel?

13:03.014 --> 13:05.017
Put some damn pants on.

13:05.049 --> 13:07.218
Meet back for briefing
at 1000 hours.

13:07.251 --> 13:10.188
And someone please get that
asshole off of my cot.

13:15.460 --> 13:19.264
Jack Kilmore, Co-Founder and
CEO of X-Corp.

13:20.231 --> 13:22.166
Colonel.

13:22.200 --> 13:25.938
He started his first
tech company at age 19.

13:25.971 --> 13:30.576
<i>Hailed by Hi-Tech magazine as the
golden child of technical engineering.</i>

13:31.342 --> 13:32.877
A true genius.

13:32.910 --> 13:35.046
And, yes, I am jealous.

13:35.080 --> 13:38.317
At the ripe old age of 26,
he gets the call from Uncle Sam.

13:38.350 --> 13:39.884
They're starting a new
sector on home defense,

13:39.918 --> 13:44.923
one that specializes in remote-controlled
weaponry and surveillance equipment.

13:44.956 --> 13:46.317
They're looking for assistance.

13:46.323 --> 13:48.392
They make him an offer
that he can't refuse.

13:48.426 --> 13:49.811
So who gives a shit?

13:49.812 --> 13:51.196
Lock it up, Private.

13:51.229 --> 13:53.632
Yesterday while searching
grid 307, I came across

13:53.664 --> 13:56.868
a Cyborg pursuing a male
and female target.

13:56.902 --> 13:59.471
The Cyborg killed the female
on the spot, but kept the male alive.

13:59.504 --> 14:02.074
He then took the target
to an abandoned warehouse

14:02.106 --> 14:04.610
just outside the grid's
western perimeter.

14:04.643 --> 14:07.079
We believe this to be
a storage facility for the machines.

14:07.111 --> 14:08.980
Right.

14:09.014 --> 14:14.119
So, this is a shot pulled from the spy
cam used by Lieutenant Spears.

14:14.686 --> 14:16.922
Magnified 750%.

14:16.955 --> 14:20.125
We believe this to be
Mr. X-Corp himself.

14:20.158 --> 14:21.360
Jack Kilmore.

14:21.393 --> 14:22.961
Jack Kilmore's dead.

14:22.994 --> 14:25.163
He's right. Jack Kilmore
was their first target.

14:25.196 --> 14:29.301
Killed by his own machines after he
tried to shut the whole thing down.

14:29.333 --> 14:32.169
Come on, everybody
knows that story.

14:32.202 --> 14:34.105
I found this
buried in the sand.

14:35.606 --> 14:37.942
It was left behind by the guy in
these photographs.

14:37.975 --> 14:41.913
We cracked it open this
morning. It checks out.

14:41.947 --> 14:44.267
It's information that only the
highest level of authority

14:44.682 --> 14:46.350
would even have access to.

14:46.384 --> 14:48.486
Yeah? What kind
of information?

14:48.519 --> 14:49.922
Top-secret shit.

14:49.955 --> 14:53.359
It's him. It's Jack Kilmore,
and he's alive.

14:54.725 --> 14:57.562
It's simple.
An extraction mission.

14:57.595 --> 15:00.432
Get in, grab the son
of a bitch, and get out.

15:00.465 --> 15:01.934
And try not to die.

15:01.966 --> 15:03.269
How do we know it's not a trap?

15:03.302 --> 15:06.071
We don't. But if there's a chance,
we're gonna have to take it.

15:06.104 --> 15:09.541
Jack Kilmore could have
information.

15:09.573 --> 15:12.009
Information that could change
the course of this war.

15:12.043 --> 15:14.413
War? This isn't a war.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.549
It's a massacre.

15:17.581 --> 15:20.585
All right, let's
cut the shit. Jones, Lopez, Carlisle,

15:20.618 --> 15:22.120
you're up.

15:22.153 --> 15:23.422
That's only three.

15:23.455 --> 15:25.424
We're going to need as
many hands as we can get.

15:25.456 --> 15:26.891
We don't have time.

15:26.924 --> 15:31.028
It's a two-day hike by foot.
The buggy only fits three, minus supplies.

15:31.062 --> 15:33.298
- You're going to have to do this alone.
- You're talking about suicide.

15:33.331 --> 15:34.892
What's wrong, Private?
You scared?

15:36.600 --> 15:37.970
I'll go.

15:38.003 --> 15:39.471
No, you're staying
right here, Lieutenant.

15:39.504 --> 15:40.672
I need soldiers that listen.

15:40.705 --> 15:41.506
Colonel, but...

15:41.507 --> 15:42.307
That's an order.

15:42.340 --> 15:43.375
You got it?

15:46.110 --> 15:47.011
Good.

15:51.081 --> 15:52.350
Crazy bastard.

16:12.437 --> 16:14.272
He's going to
get us all killed.

16:14.304 --> 16:16.607
Or kill us himself.

16:16.640 --> 16:19.677
Son of a bitch has been shot 30 times,
and he's still breathing.

16:19.711 --> 16:21.746
I wouldn't mess with
Captain Machine Gun.

16:21.779 --> 16:24.048
He'd cut your throat
and not even know it.

16:24.081 --> 16:27.451
And that ain't no shit.
Desperate times.

16:27.485 --> 16:30.221
Like it or not, boys
and girls, we are in 'em.

16:30.254 --> 16:32.356
Those supply kits
are all but gone.

16:32.389 --> 16:34.425
That means the time
to act is now.

16:34.458 --> 16:37.495
Before you know it, you'll be eating
your own shit just to stay alive.

16:37.528 --> 16:42.134
I've seen it too many times.
Men turned to swine,

16:42.167 --> 16:45.170
shoveling shit in
each other's throats.

16:45.202 --> 16:46.538
Drinking their own piss.

16:49.106 --> 16:51.342
- Is that how you want to go down?
- No, sir.

16:51.375 --> 16:55.112
I didn't hear you!
Do you want to eat shit and drink piss?

16:55.145 --> 16:57.181
Sir, no, sir!

16:57.215 --> 16:59.216
I didn't think so. Now I want that
piece of shit on wheels locked,

16:59.250 --> 17:01.253
strapped, and ready to
move by 1100 hours.

17:01.285 --> 17:04.423
And I want Kilmore sitting right here,
kissing my ass by sun down.

17:04.454 --> 17:05.490
Any questions?

17:05.491 --> 17:06.523
No, sir!

17:06.557 --> 17:08.059
Good.
Let's move!

17:20.872 --> 17:22.141
Hey.

17:24.142 --> 17:25.742
You know this is
all your fault, right?

17:27.711 --> 17:29.548
You should never have
brought in the strays.

17:32.349 --> 17:34.418
We'd have had food
for an extra month.

17:34.451 --> 17:35.721
Maybe more.

17:39.457 --> 17:41.577
You should have left the
dogs where you found 'em.

17:42.693 --> 17:44.163
They weren't our problem.

17:46.798 --> 17:48.400
No,

17:49.800 --> 17:51.336
men like you.
That's the problem.

17:55.772 --> 17:58.342
You ever touch me again,
I'll cut your throat. Got it?

18:24.868 --> 18:28.372
<i>Lopez, you're
our eyes on the inside.</i>

18:28.405 --> 18:31.643
<i>Make sure you're sweeping and panning.
We need to see everything you see.</i>

18:32.911 --> 18:33.812
Copy that, Colonel.

18:33.813 --> 18:34.712
Okay.

18:35.613 --> 18:36.815
You're wired.

18:37.481 --> 18:38.750
Kill it.

18:41.586 --> 18:42.753
We loaded?

18:42.787 --> 18:44.322
Affirmative.
Good luck, soldier.

18:44.355 --> 18:45.891
Come back in one piece,
you hear me?

18:45.923 --> 18:47.459
I need another girl
to have my back.

18:48.759 --> 18:49.961
Is that an order?

18:49.962 --> 18:51.163
That's an order.

18:51.195 --> 18:53.330
<i>- All right, Lopez, you ready?
- Ready.</i>

18:53.364 --> 18:54.665
<i>Let's move!</i>

19:04.942 --> 19:07.145
Now let's just hope
it's not a death trap.

19:08.278 --> 19:09.548
Take a look
around you, Colonel.

19:10.582 --> 19:11.850
We're already in one.

19:13.218 --> 19:14.419
Why don't you go clean up?

19:15.953 --> 19:17.755
Meet me back at comms
at 1200 hours.

19:54.392 --> 19:55.559
What you doing?

19:55.593 --> 19:56.728
Uh...

19:58.262 --> 19:59.497
I'm just working, sweetheart.

20:01.531 --> 20:02.833
Do you want to play?

20:06.471 --> 20:08.272
I can't right now, sweetie,

20:10.008 --> 20:11.442
but how about later?
Do you want to play then?

20:11.476 --> 20:13.345
You mean like hide and go seek?

20:14.612 --> 20:16.413
Like hide and go seek.

20:16.446 --> 20:19.717
Okay, but you're "it" first.

20:19.750 --> 20:20.785
No, you're "it."

20:20.786 --> 20:21.819
No, you're "it."

20:21.853 --> 20:23.288
No, you're "it."

20:23.855 --> 20:25.923
No.

20:25.957 --> 20:27.693
You're "it." Tap-tap,
no take-backs.

20:48.378 --> 20:50.848
<i>Structure
appears to be intact.</i>

20:50.882 --> 20:53.751
Radar showing a slight internal
change of temperature.

20:53.785 --> 20:54.920
Voltage, I assume.

20:54.952 --> 20:57.454
<i>Copy. Let's keep
it tight. In and out.</i>

20:57.488 --> 20:59.008
<i>Ready when you are,
Lieutenant.</i>

21:37.961 --> 21:39.597
What the hell
is this place?

21:44.836 --> 21:46.637
<i>You sure
it's the right spot?</i>

21:48.673 --> 21:49.974
Yeah, this is it.

21:52.542 --> 21:55.746
Yeah, this is bullshit.

21:55.779 --> 21:58.649
<i>Just keep your weapons ready
and keep moving.</i>

22:00.984 --> 22:03.354
Jones, stay cover.

22:03.387 --> 22:05.557
Keep an eye on
the entry points.

22:05.589 --> 22:06.724
I'll run the sweep.

22:23.074 --> 22:24.609
Careful, Private.

22:38.890 --> 22:40.092
Wait, Lopez, pan left.

22:43.094 --> 22:44.496
<i>There.</i>

22:44.528 --> 22:45.596
I see it.

22:49.066 --> 22:50.402
Engaging.

23:04.949 --> 23:06.518
I lost my light.

23:07.984 --> 23:10.654
Hang on, this room has power.

23:14.659 --> 23:16.628
Hey, asshole.

23:16.661 --> 23:18.797
<i>- Jones, I need backup now!
- Copy. I'm on my way!</i>

23:42.487 --> 23:44.048
What the hell
is this place?

23:47.224 --> 23:49.059
Are you seeing this?

23:51.695 --> 23:53.130
Yeah, we see it.

23:53.163 --> 23:56.033
If this is where they brought the
target, then he's already dead.

23:56.067 --> 23:57.635
Yeah, and guess who's next.

24:03.708 --> 24:04.843
Ahh!

24:05.977 --> 24:07.711
Put the knife down.

24:07.744 --> 24:09.847
Shit, man, don't kill me.

24:11.214 --> 24:15.220
Kilmore. Kilmore,
let him go.

24:15.252 --> 24:16.003
Who are you?

24:17.587 --> 24:18.655
Who are you! Answer me!

24:18.689 --> 24:20.592
Oh, shit.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.559
We came for you, Kilmore.

24:22.593 --> 24:25.029
Jack Kilmore?
Is that your name?

24:31.301 --> 24:32.736
That's him, that's Kilmore.

24:35.873 --> 24:37.575
You son of a bitch.

24:37.607 --> 24:38.643
Carlisle.

24:39.809 --> 24:41.178
You want some? Huh?

24:41.979 --> 24:44.249
Don't do it, Carlisle.

24:44.281 --> 24:46.150
This asshole tried to kill me.

24:48.085 --> 24:50.755
It's all his fault.

24:50.788 --> 24:54.057
If it weren't for him, none of this
would have happened. None of it!

24:54.090 --> 24:55.894
<i>Stand down, Private.</i>

24:55.926 --> 24:57.728
<i>Do you copy?</i>

24:57.761 --> 24:59.063
Stand down, Carlisle.

25:05.970 --> 25:07.771
You can rot in hell, Jones.

25:12.876 --> 25:14.111
You all can rot in hell.

25:15.112 --> 25:16.548
I'm not dying in here.

25:25.923 --> 25:27.443
You wanna give me
a hand over here?

25:29.926 --> 25:31.128
Machines?

25:32.063 --> 25:35.633
Yeah. And they know
you're here.

25:35.665 --> 25:38.635
<i>We lost signal of Carlisle.
Do you have a visual?</i>

25:43.307 --> 25:44.776
He's dead.

25:49.313 --> 25:51.550
All right!
Let's go!

26:00.891 --> 26:04.362
<i>We're getting strong readings,
we need to get you out of there, now.</i>

26:04.394 --> 26:07.097
<i>Did you hear me, Lieutenant?
You need to move!</i>

26:08.231 --> 26:09.800
What are you doing?

26:11.001 --> 26:12.836
Come on, let's go!

26:14.372 --> 26:15.874
We've gotta move now!

26:38.996 --> 26:40.098
Let's go!

26:45.269 --> 26:46.804
Come on!

26:46.836 --> 26:49.140
Lopez? Lopez
can you hear me?

26:49.173 --> 26:51.343
<i>Lopez, you got something,
12 o'clock!</i>

26:55.913 --> 26:57.115
Get down!

27:11.961 --> 27:13.263
Is there a ride outta here?

27:13.297 --> 27:14.633
Yeah.

27:16.433 --> 27:17.668
All right, let's go!

27:48.398 --> 27:49.633
<i>I'm hit.</i>

27:49.666 --> 27:51.968
You're gonna make it, soldier.
Hang in there. Hang in there!

27:52.001 --> 27:53.971
They're coming this way.

27:54.003 --> 27:55.472
We have to make them wait.
Make sure they aren't being tailed.

27:55.506 --> 27:56.740
No, no. She won't make it.

27:56.773 --> 27:59.810
If they compromise our location,
nobody's going to make it.

27:59.844 --> 28:01.778
Not them, not us, nobody.

28:01.811 --> 28:05.382
Damn it, she's one of our
own! And we need Kilmore.

28:06.817 --> 28:10.020
If we die, we die as one.

28:16.861 --> 28:18.296
Shit. Move out!

28:28.506 --> 28:29.740
Is that where we're going?

28:33.012 --> 28:33.812
Take this.

28:35.145 --> 28:37.065
Hold it against the wound.
Keep pressure on it.

28:38.816 --> 28:40.250
I'm not going to die out here.

29:08.345 --> 29:09.913
How bad is it?

29:09.946 --> 29:11.515
You're doing good.
Just hang in there, soldier.

29:11.548 --> 29:13.384
Damn it, answer me.

29:13.416 --> 29:15.153
I'm doing everything I can.

29:57.493 --> 30:00.330
What? Think I can't shoot?

30:00.364 --> 30:02.066
I'm not as worthless as
everyone thinks.

30:04.101 --> 30:07.939
Give it back.
I said give it back.

30:13.943 --> 30:15.078
Do you want to shoot?

30:18.315 --> 30:19.484
Shoot to kill.

30:24.622 --> 30:29.093
And if you want to kill,
shoot for the head.

30:40.270 --> 30:42.507
We were stationed here
when it all went down.

30:44.240 --> 30:48.479
We played it safe.
Waited for the Cyborgs to pass us by.

30:48.511 --> 30:52.115
We were lucky.
Now, what about you?

30:53.651 --> 30:55.171
How the hell are you
still alive?

30:59.390 --> 31:00.892
Are these really necessary?

31:02.660 --> 31:03.995
I don't know yet.

31:14.038 --> 31:15.640
I was with a group
of survivors.

31:15.673 --> 31:17.642
Hiding underground.
Trying to fight back.

31:19.442 --> 31:20.545
But we were limited.

31:21.679 --> 31:24.015
We had weapons, but lacked
the other hardware needed.

31:25.048 --> 31:26.317
And what would that be?

31:27.284 --> 31:29.353
Computers,

31:29.385 --> 31:30.587
and the power to run them.

31:32.423 --> 31:34.543
We had been scavenging
for parts, trying to rebuild.

31:38.127 --> 31:39.297
Then it found us.

31:42.165 --> 31:45.001
There's a wash station
a couple units down.

31:45.035 --> 31:48.273
We'll get you some new gear.
And by new, I mean used.

32:00.017 --> 32:01.085
How's she doing?

32:02.720 --> 32:04.322
She won't make it
through the night.

32:05.990 --> 32:07.191
We made the right move.

32:07.223 --> 32:09.426
No.

32:09.460 --> 32:10.728
I should have been there.
It should have been me.

32:10.760 --> 32:12.195
You got a lot of nerve,
Lieutenant.

32:17.500 --> 32:21.204
All right, it's been a long day,
and it's been rough,

32:21.238 --> 32:22.974
so let's cut this shit.

32:23.007 --> 32:24.942
We saved your ass
for a reason, Kilmore.

32:26.309 --> 32:28.011
We need details.

32:28.045 --> 32:30.114
We need to know what happened.

32:30.146 --> 32:32.582
We need to know exactly
what it is we're fighting against,

32:32.615 --> 32:33.884
and we need to know
how to kill it.

32:33.917 --> 32:37.620
Because right now, all we do know
is that those machines of yours

32:37.653 --> 32:39.656
wiped out 99% of the planet.

32:45.528 --> 32:50.233
About a month prior to the blackout,
we received a visitor to our main facility.

32:51.769 --> 32:54.739
It was the President of
the United States.

32:54.771 --> 32:57.073
He told me about a new technology
one of the sister corporations

32:57.106 --> 33:00.610
had been developing. Something to aid
in the fight against foreign threats.

33:00.644 --> 33:02.113
What kind of technology?

33:04.548 --> 33:07.709
They had engineered artificial intelligence
into the form of a cyber virus.

33:09.086 --> 33:10.653
The intent was to use
the virus to infiltrate

33:10.686 --> 33:12.389
and gain control
of enemy mainframes.

33:14.223 --> 33:16.126
So then why did
they come to you?

33:18.061 --> 33:21.398
We had the infrastructure
and technology to do it.

33:24.401 --> 33:25.635
That's what they told us.

33:26.436 --> 33:28.638
But that was bullshit.

33:28.672 --> 33:31.112
The real reason was that they wanted
to keep it a secret.

33:32.276 --> 33:34.345
In case anything went wrong.

33:36.579 --> 33:41.785
On July 4th, 2017, at 1300 hours,
we uploaded the folder containing the virus.

33:41.818 --> 33:45.789
By 1301, we had lost control
of our entire operating bay.

33:45.823 --> 33:49.393
All the screens from our main concourse
to our counter facilities went black,

33:49.425 --> 33:51.261
then turned to a page
of scrolling numbers.

33:51.295 --> 33:55.700
Everything was changed, pass codes,
platforms, locations, everything.

33:58.335 --> 33:59.569
The rest is history.

33:59.603 --> 34:00.705
So what went wrong?

34:01.739 --> 34:04.709
No way to know for sure,
but if I had to guess,

34:06.309 --> 34:07.510
I'd say they made it
a little too smart.

34:07.545 --> 34:10.547
They gave it a mind of
its own, and it decided to use it.

34:10.581 --> 34:13.284
You see, we never opened
the source file.

34:14.284 --> 34:15.420
So then who did?

34:16.619 --> 34:18.056
It opened itself.

34:19.690 --> 34:21.449
Are you telling me
this thing is alive?

34:22.726 --> 34:24.327
I'm just telling you
what I saw.

34:26.762 --> 34:29.431
How do we kill it?

34:29.465 --> 34:30.367
It's not that simple.

34:30.368 --> 34:31.268
How do we kill it?

34:33.603 --> 34:36.272
We don't. We disarm it.

34:36.306 --> 34:39.110
If we turn off the machines, then
we take away its ability to strike.

34:42.612 --> 34:43.780
Keep talking.

34:47.583 --> 34:48.618
Oh...

34:51.922 --> 34:53.224
Easy.

35:07.838 --> 35:10.508
The machines were designed
to operate under a signal,

35:10.541 --> 35:13.577
just like a cellular device.
Remote control.

35:13.610 --> 35:16.480
Each one with its own receiver.

35:16.512 --> 35:19.116
If you knock out the receiver,
you knock out the machine.

35:20.951 --> 35:24.789
But if we can knock out the signal,
we can take down a whole sector.

35:25.922 --> 35:27.357
Where are the signals
coming from?

35:27.391 --> 35:29.159
Control stations.

35:29.193 --> 35:31.495
A system of servers and satellite
communications equipment.

35:31.527 --> 35:33.496
So why don't we strap it
with a block of C-4

35:33.530 --> 35:35.399
and blow it clear
out of the sky?

35:35.431 --> 35:37.467
Because we have to
find them first.

35:39.268 --> 35:40.668
That's been our
problem all along.

35:41.572 --> 35:43.307
The original towers
have been cut off.

35:43.340 --> 35:45.876
It now operates under
its own stations.

35:45.909 --> 35:48.878
But if we can capture a data drive
from one of the drones,

35:48.911 --> 35:52.382
we may be able to access flight
data or records from the inner CPU.

35:52.416 --> 35:55.519
There has to be something linking
the machines to the signal source.

35:58.322 --> 36:00.356
So what's our next move,
cowboy?

36:00.389 --> 36:04.295
I saw intelligence equipment in one
of your units. Is it functional?

36:04.327 --> 36:07.197
Yeah. I mean, it's a little outdated,
but it's functional.

36:07.231 --> 36:08.871
Will the ports read
an external drive?

36:09.498 --> 36:11.534
Last I checked.

36:11.568 --> 36:14.271
Then we need to capture a data drive
and see if we can search its logs.

36:14.304 --> 36:16.440
What the hell do you mean,
capture a data drive?

36:16.472 --> 36:17.324
We go hunting.

36:19.543 --> 36:20.678
What is he, nuts?

36:20.710 --> 36:21.811
When?

36:23.480 --> 36:25.349
Yesterday.

36:25.382 --> 36:28.284
For all we know, this location
has already been compromised.

36:28.318 --> 36:31.189
No, if it knew,
we'd be dead already.

36:34.358 --> 36:37.595
We should leave in the morning.
The machines have night vision. We don't.

36:38.762 --> 36:43.400
First light. Locked
and strapped by 0700 hours.

36:43.432 --> 36:46.603
I'm going to need another shooter.
Someone that knows what they're doing.

36:46.637 --> 36:47.998
We're only going
to get one shot.

36:49.706 --> 36:50.875
I'll go.

36:54.543 --> 36:57.981
Don't let those perky tits fool you,
she doesn't mess around.

37:02.753 --> 37:04.222
I hope you're right.

37:05.856 --> 37:07.258
Otherwise we're dead.

37:27.311 --> 37:28.672
How could this happen?

37:30.380 --> 37:32.516
You said this could
never happen.

37:33.849 --> 37:35.252
We were wrong.

37:36.952 --> 37:38.788
We were all wrong.

37:41.992 --> 37:43.512
We have to do something!

37:45.594 --> 37:46.930
We have to do something now!

38:06.817 --> 38:08.052
Jack.

38:09.985 --> 38:11.355
Help me.

38:13.556 --> 38:14.824
Help me, Jack.

38:46.989 --> 38:50.760
You know, it's not polite
to read someone's hard drive.

38:50.793 --> 38:52.596
I'm doing what any smart
soldier would do.

38:54.965 --> 38:56.367
And what's that?

39:00.436 --> 39:01.938
Researching the enemy.

39:05.876 --> 39:08.045
Is that what you think
I am, the enemy?

39:13.750 --> 39:15.719
The RCT.

39:15.751 --> 39:17.820
It was meant to be
used on opposing ground troops.

39:17.853 --> 39:21.591
We would strap on the prisoners of war,
then send them back out to the field,

39:21.625 --> 39:23.827
watch 'em fight against
their own regime.

39:23.860 --> 39:25.062
Are you proud of this?

39:30.166 --> 39:32.068
We built them to keep soldiers
like you off the battlefield.

39:32.101 --> 39:33.536
Is that what they told you?

39:39.175 --> 39:41.811
The Cerebrum
Controller, C-1.

39:41.844 --> 39:43.880
What's it do?

39:43.914 --> 39:46.016
It was also meant to control the
physical functions of the host.

39:46.048 --> 39:47.451
You mean "slave."

39:49.652 --> 39:53.890
But unlike the RCT, it also had the ability
to read and control something else.

39:55.759 --> 39:56.827
What?

39:58.527 --> 40:00.196
Their mind.

40:00.230 --> 40:02.166
You think you're so
smart, don't you?

40:02.199 --> 40:03.867
You just don't get it.

40:03.900 --> 40:04.934
We were trying to save lives.

40:04.967 --> 40:06.603
You didn't save lives.

40:06.635 --> 40:09.407
Take a look around,
you destroyed them.

40:10.940 --> 40:12.041
All.

40:18.815 --> 40:21.018
I think we're better off
staying next to the rocks.

40:21.050 --> 40:24.054
Right. A little more cover
in case some shit goes wrong.

40:24.086 --> 40:26.086
And we'll need something
with a lot of firepower.

40:26.956 --> 40:28.659
The .50 cal won't get it done.

40:28.692 --> 40:29.693
Got grenades.

40:33.929 --> 40:37.902
Maybe something with
a little more accuracy.

40:39.503 --> 40:41.183
What about
a rocket launcher?

40:45.108 --> 40:46.544
That should work.

41:52.876 --> 41:55.179
Take your time.
Aim for the...

42:05.922 --> 42:07.057
Nice shot.

42:12.996 --> 42:15.699
Keep an eye out.
There could be more close by.

42:25.875 --> 42:29.045
Okay, okay, okay,
we've got a live one.

42:37.786 --> 42:39.322
Always so private, aren't they?

42:43.092 --> 42:44.295
Let me see it.

42:53.235 --> 42:55.172
Now we wait.

42:55.204 --> 42:57.740
- For what?
- The script to run its course.

42:57.773 --> 42:58.942
It's checking
the drone's access code

42:58.974 --> 43:00.614
against a list of
possible combinations.

43:02.077 --> 43:03.246
And, uh...

43:04.047 --> 43:05.983
What if it doesn't have it?

43:08.918 --> 43:11.088
Very unlikely.

43:11.121 --> 43:13.789
The file has over
750 trillion characters.

43:13.822 --> 43:15.725
And it runs 16 million
attempts per second.

43:16.393 --> 43:18.728
Trust me. It'll find it.

43:27.137 --> 43:29.707
Five bricks. Enough
to blow up a small village.

43:30.273 --> 43:31.375
How much you want?

43:31.407 --> 43:32.742
All of it.

43:34.043 --> 43:35.378
I taught you well, Lieutenant.

43:35.411 --> 43:37.380
Any word on the logs?

43:37.414 --> 43:38.816
They're still working on it.

43:39.282 --> 43:40.984
Mmm.

43:41.016 --> 43:43.219
Reminds me
of the good old days.

43:43.253 --> 43:47.124
Back in '68,
back when we kept shit real.

43:47.157 --> 43:49.293
None of
this technology bullshit.

43:53.963 --> 43:55.733
Back when the world was right.

44:22.125 --> 44:23.860
Hey. Hey!

44:24.994 --> 44:26.230
I said, "Do you copy?"

44:28.130 --> 44:29.298
Yes, sir.

44:29.331 --> 44:31.300
Good.

44:31.333 --> 44:36.172
Front office at 1700 hours.
I want this shit locked down tight.

44:36.206 --> 44:37.527
Want everybody
on the same page.

44:41.376 --> 44:43.813
It's checked against a quarter of
its data already.

44:43.847 --> 44:47.284
Turns out that we're dealing with
a multi-layered access code.

44:47.317 --> 44:48.851
We've already cracked one.

44:48.885 --> 44:50.921
Speak English, gringo.

44:50.954 --> 44:54.891
It means that the script is working.
It won't be long.

44:54.923 --> 44:59.496
Okay. Until then,
we continue to get shit done.

44:59.528 --> 45:02.432
Kilmore, assuming
we get the location, what's the plan?

45:05.135 --> 45:07.871
We get in,
set the detonators, and get out.

45:07.903 --> 45:10.373
And that's it?
No more machines?

45:11.875 --> 45:13.909
Not within the station's
control radius.

45:13.943 --> 45:15.946
Approximately 500 miles.

45:15.978 --> 45:19.248
So what you're saying is, they're
still around, just not in our backyard?

45:19.282 --> 45:20.951
- Correct.
- Oh, wait, wait, wait.

45:22.452 --> 45:25.355
500 miles?

45:25.387 --> 45:28.125
So all this work that we're doing,
putting our asses on the line,

45:28.157 --> 45:30.393
and best-case scenario
is that we slow it down?

45:31.126 --> 45:32.895
It's a start, ain't it?

45:32.929 --> 45:35.432
He's right.
It's a start.

45:35.465 --> 45:37.834
We'll at least have the ability
to restock and relocate.

45:37.867 --> 45:40.070
Then prepare for
another advance.

45:40.103 --> 45:41.471
What about getting inside?

45:41.503 --> 45:43.005
How do you navigate
those machines?

45:43.572 --> 45:45.007
Shoot 'em.

45:47.143 --> 45:49.112
Shouldn't be an issue.

45:49.144 --> 45:51.547
It's going to keep
the control bays hidden.

45:51.581 --> 45:53.884
Very unlikely we'll come across
any drones or Cyborgs.

45:54.583 --> 45:57.119
At least not on the exterior.

45:57.152 --> 45:59.522
Uh-huh. And
what about the interior?

46:04.293 --> 46:05.962
We're gonna have to move fast.

46:06.563 --> 46:09.432
Yeah, yeah, okay.

46:30.552 --> 46:32.121
Hey.

46:33.456 --> 46:34.708
Did I wake you?

46:34.709 --> 46:35.959
No.

46:37.360 --> 46:38.495
Good.

46:41.264 --> 46:44.000
Can I sleep with you tonight?

46:44.032 --> 46:47.069
Of course, sweetie.
Scary dreams again?

46:47.103 --> 46:48.338
Yeah.

46:49.105 --> 46:50.474
I'm sorry, sweetie.

46:53.076 --> 46:54.443
Can I ask you a question?

46:55.911 --> 46:57.814
You can ask me
whatever you want.

47:00.148 --> 47:01.788
You're not going to
leave me, are you?

47:03.987 --> 47:07.224
Of course not. Why would you say
something like that?

47:07.257 --> 47:08.358
Promise?

47:12.996 --> 47:14.264
Cross my heart.

47:20.202 --> 47:21.405
What's wrong?

47:28.010 --> 47:32.315
You know, I used to have
a daughter who looked just like you.

47:32.347 --> 47:32.932
Really?

47:32.933 --> 47:33.516
Yeah.

47:35.985 --> 47:37.086
What was her name?

47:37.619 --> 47:38.989
Her name was Becca.

47:40.989 --> 47:43.092
She's the one
who made this for me.

47:43.126 --> 47:43.794
Really?

47:43.795 --> 47:44.461
Mmm-hmm.

47:46.262 --> 47:47.431
Where is she now?

47:55.605 --> 47:57.074
She's in heaven.

48:21.264 --> 48:23.500
Hey, a skinny kid
with glasses was looking for you.

48:26.702 --> 48:28.637
What did he say?

48:28.670 --> 48:30.206
He said he was looking for you.

48:36.211 --> 48:39.916
You can feel it, can't
you? Blood in the air.

48:42.552 --> 48:43.921
Feels good.

48:56.264 --> 48:58.184
You know what any
of this bullshit means?

48:59.735 --> 49:01.070
Yeah.

49:02.771 --> 49:04.606
It means we still
have a chance.

49:04.639 --> 49:07.009
Those are the coordinates
to X-Corp's head facility.

49:07.043 --> 49:08.244
Ground Zero.

49:08.277 --> 49:11.714
That's a couple hours south of here,
but it's impossible.

49:11.748 --> 49:13.383
Ground Zero was leveled.

49:13.416 --> 49:14.985
I've seen it,
there's nothing left.

49:17.619 --> 49:19.339
Maybe you weren't
looking hard enough.

49:23.726 --> 49:25.362
Turn it off.

49:31.601 --> 49:33.603
Damn it, I said turn that
piece of shit off!

49:33.635 --> 49:35.637
Wait, wait, wait.

49:35.670 --> 49:41.043
36.8025 degrees north,
114.0822 degrees west.

49:42.344 --> 49:43.545
Coordinates.

49:43.579 --> 49:47.017
Yeah. Our coordinates.

49:50.219 --> 49:51.288
Shh.

49:59.228 --> 50:00.597
It had a tracker.

50:00.630 --> 50:02.632
- A what?
- The drive. It had a tracer.

50:02.664 --> 50:03.800
Son of a bitch!

50:03.833 --> 50:05.268
Hit the lights!

50:10.405 --> 50:12.141
We're getting swarmed.

50:13.141 --> 50:14.309
How'd they find us?

50:14.342 --> 50:15.410
It had a tracer.

50:15.411 --> 50:16.478
What had a tracer?

50:16.512 --> 50:18.248
The data drive. When we pulled the
coordinates, it gave up our location.

50:18.280 --> 50:19.648
We got the coordinates?

50:19.681 --> 50:21.417
Yeah, right here.
X-Corp's head facility. Ground Zero.

50:28.391 --> 50:29.693
Get down!

50:50.313 --> 50:51.448
We got another one!

50:53.315 --> 50:54.317
Get down!

50:58.688 --> 50:59.256
No!

51:08.463 --> 51:10.567
- I'm running low.
- We gotta get to the bunker.

51:10.599 --> 51:12.134
I don't think we can make it.

51:25.514 --> 51:27.317
We gotta stick to the plan.
Shut it down.

51:27.349 --> 51:29.251
It's the only way we'll see
tomorrow in one piece.

51:29.284 --> 51:30.519
What about Molly?

51:33.456 --> 51:34.557
Where is she?

51:34.590 --> 51:35.725
Bunks.

51:35.757 --> 51:37.326
Whatever we do,
we need to do it now!

51:40.896 --> 51:42.331
When those bastards
start chasing you,

51:42.364 --> 51:44.800
I'll look for an opening, and when
it's clear, I'll head to the bunker.

51:44.833 --> 51:45.801
I'm not leaving her.

51:45.835 --> 51:49.172
Damn it, Lieutenant!
It's not your call, okay?

51:49.204 --> 51:51.804
I'm calling the shots, I'm the
shot-caller. You understand that?

51:53.675 --> 51:54.777
Hey!

51:56.478 --> 51:59.148
I need you and Wizkowski
on that piece of shit.

51:59.181 --> 52:00.649
Early departure.

52:05.320 --> 52:05.954
You ready?

52:05.955 --> 52:06.588
Yeah.

52:06.621 --> 52:09.225
All right, let's go.
Move it, move it!

52:34.983 --> 52:36.385
No!

52:41.257 --> 52:42.392
Go!

52:45.860 --> 52:47.429
Where's Colonel?

52:48.297 --> 52:49.599
What part?

52:54.836 --> 52:57.206
Let's move,
we need to move now!

52:57.239 --> 52:59.708
You gotta get him
to the bunker.

52:59.742 --> 53:01.778
They're safe with Machine Gun.

53:03.713 --> 53:04.993
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go!

53:12.387 --> 53:13.789
We gotta distract them.

53:31.740 --> 53:32.809
Come on, kid!

53:36.746 --> 53:38.381
My teddy!

53:38.414 --> 53:39.482
Come on!

53:40.449 --> 53:41.751
Get in here.

53:54.329 --> 53:55.532
No!

54:06.976 --> 54:08.445
Get down!

54:26.094 --> 54:27.630
Let's go! Let's go!

54:34.536 --> 54:35.704
Hey!

54:38.074 --> 54:39.675
You ready to die?

55:12.708 --> 55:13.976
I'm scared.

55:16.679 --> 55:19.416
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

55:22.150 --> 55:23.719
Do you think they're
gonna come back?

55:26.389 --> 55:27.557
She promised.

55:28.791 --> 55:30.660
Yeah.
They'll come back.

56:11.065 --> 56:14.102
I checked the gear againlast night.
Looks like the Colonel was off.

56:14.135 --> 56:16.838
We have no C-4,
no detonators, no grenades,

56:16.871 --> 56:18.540
and ammo is low.

56:22.744 --> 56:23.947
We have to get inside.

56:25.447 --> 56:26.915
We have to shut it down
by hand.

56:38.693 --> 56:39.996
It's over, isn't it?

56:41.730 --> 56:43.250
We never had a chance
against them.

56:46.168 --> 56:48.688
There's going to be a lot of activity
for the next hour or so,

56:48.971 --> 56:50.706
then it should die down.

56:50.739 --> 56:52.574
At least enough
to make a run for it.

56:54.677 --> 56:56.997
If we stay next to the covered areas,
we might slip past.

57:04.219 --> 57:05.654
We have to go back.

57:07.956 --> 57:09.491
If we go back now,
everyone dies.

57:11.059 --> 57:12.561
No.

57:12.594 --> 57:14.230
We have to stick to the plan.

57:14.262 --> 57:16.098
I made her a promise.

57:18.166 --> 57:19.536
I can't let her die alone.

57:21.170 --> 57:22.639
You did what you had to do.

57:24.907 --> 57:27.977
And you're not dead yet,
neither are they.

57:29.711 --> 57:30.947
We still have a chance.

57:32.547 --> 57:35.217
It's not over yet,
remember that.

58:06.748 --> 58:08.783
We've been clear for
almost three kilometers.

58:08.817 --> 58:10.052
Something's not right.

58:11.920 --> 58:13.489
Just keep driving.

58:14.289 --> 58:15.757
We're getting close.

58:45.621 --> 58:47.222
There, you see?

58:48.356 --> 58:50.192
Like I said,
there's nothing left.

59:15.150 --> 59:16.219
No.

59:18.152 --> 59:19.187
It's here.

59:40.175 --> 59:43.278
I remember talk of an underground
safe zone when we were first building.

59:43.311 --> 59:44.872
I thought the idea
had been dismissed,

59:44.880 --> 59:48.718
but I'm starting to think
they never got the memo.

01:00:23.452 --> 01:00:24.854
Let's go.

01:01:51.373 --> 01:01:52.909
Is it alive?

01:01:55.777 --> 01:01:57.417
If it was functional,
you wouldn't be.

01:01:58.146 --> 01:01:59.449
Be careful.

01:02:15.264 --> 01:02:16.865
I got something.

01:02:29.244 --> 01:02:31.914
This is it, huh?

01:02:31.947 --> 01:02:35.852
Not quite as hi-tech
as I imagined.

01:02:38.253 --> 01:02:39.756
That is all right.

01:02:45.293 --> 01:02:47.129
That's weird,
there's no pass code.

01:02:50.364 --> 01:02:51.867
No login. Nothing.

01:02:54.969 --> 01:02:55.971
Hey.

01:02:58.206 --> 01:02:59.307
Hey!

01:03:01.043 --> 01:03:03.445
You know your way
around the system?

01:03:03.478 --> 01:03:06.048
No. All the platforms
have been changed.

01:03:06.914 --> 01:03:09.250
Okay.

01:03:09.284 --> 01:03:12.887
There's a lot of data,
lots of menus.

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:14.456
This is gonna take a minute.

01:03:31.373 --> 01:03:32.942
We might not have that long.

01:04:46.547 --> 01:04:48.016
What're you doing?

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:53.489
I'm watching the bad guys.

01:04:53.521 --> 01:04:55.122
Do you know why
they want to hurt us?

01:04:57.659 --> 01:04:59.662
- They were programmed that way.
- Why?

01:05:03.197 --> 01:05:04.299
I don't know.

01:05:08.202 --> 01:05:09.438
Hey, what's that?

01:05:16.311 --> 01:05:17.380
Hey!

01:05:27.389 --> 01:05:28.624
I wanna watch, too.

01:05:43.473 --> 01:05:44.307
Molly, no!

01:06:31.452 --> 01:06:32.688
Hey.

01:06:37.626 --> 01:06:39.461
There's something here.

01:06:41.429 --> 01:06:42.597
I can feel it.

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:53.108
Hey!

01:07:01.682 --> 01:07:03.152
What did you find?

01:07:07.722 --> 01:07:09.557
We live to
fight another day.

01:07:17.798 --> 01:07:18.666
Something's wrong.

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:19.534
No, no, no.

01:07:24.438 --> 01:07:25.673
Firewall?

01:08:13.454 --> 01:08:14.722
You alive?

01:08:16.756 --> 01:08:17.827
Yeah.

01:08:20.895 --> 01:08:22.229
Is he?

01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:32.173
No, he's gone.

01:08:40.782 --> 01:08:42.484
Something's overriding
the program.

01:08:42.515 --> 01:08:44.385
What could do that?

01:08:44.417 --> 01:08:47.590
I don't know.
Something external maybe.

01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:51.926
But it would have to be
hooked into the mainframe.

01:09:00.868 --> 01:09:02.270
Time to go.

01:09:22.356 --> 01:09:23.559
Run!

01:09:44.779 --> 01:09:46.314
Over here!

01:10:06.568 --> 01:10:07.936
What are
they doing here?

01:10:08.869 --> 01:10:10.338
They've been selected.

01:10:11.972 --> 01:10:13.475
For what?

01:10:14.975 --> 01:10:16.377
Transformation.

01:10:17.378 --> 01:10:18.881
It's going to make them
into machines.

01:10:28.023 --> 01:10:29.458
Is he there?

01:10:41.536 --> 01:10:42.738
Get down!

01:10:54.349 --> 01:10:55.484
What are you doing?

01:10:59.087 --> 01:11:00.522
Come on, let's go!

01:11:00.555 --> 01:11:02.324
I'm running low!

01:11:02.356 --> 01:11:04.025
Come on, let's go!
This way!

01:11:04.059 --> 01:11:05.394
Hurry, hurry!

01:11:07.996 --> 01:11:09.431
Hurry, move.

01:11:47.601 --> 01:11:48.770
You okay?

01:11:56.845 --> 01:11:58.314
We gotta keep moving.

01:11:59.713 --> 01:12:00.849
Come on.

01:12:56.438 --> 01:12:57.739
Why's it so quiet?

01:13:05.145 --> 01:13:06.514
Let's go.

01:13:26.167 --> 01:13:27.436
What is it?

01:13:38.078 --> 01:13:39.547
It's the firewall.

01:13:40.648 --> 01:13:42.083
Watch the door.

01:14:04.605 --> 01:14:05.940
What's wrong?

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:36.038
<i>If you wanna kill,
shoot for the head.</i>

01:15:25.653 --> 01:15:27.055
What have they done to you?

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:35.730
<i>Warning.
Removal of the Cerebrum C-1</i>

01:15:35.762 --> 01:15:39.300
<i>will leave system vulnerable
to foreign infiltration.</i>

01:15:39.333 --> 01:15:41.168
<i>Please exit immediately.</i>

01:15:49.243 --> 01:15:50.579
What are you doing?

01:15:50.612 --> 01:15:52.052
What does it look
like I'm doing?

01:16:02.756 --> 01:16:03.958
Amy?

01:16:07.328 --> 01:16:08.630
Amy?

01:16:10.864 --> 01:16:11.867
Jack.

01:16:16.003 --> 01:16:19.807
I tried to stop it, Jack.
But there was nothing I could do.

01:16:19.841 --> 01:16:22.110
No. It's not your fault.

01:16:22.909 --> 01:16:24.278
It controls me now.

01:16:25.979 --> 01:16:29.116
It made me do things, Jack.
Horrible things.

01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:30.751
It's okay now.

01:16:32.153 --> 01:16:33.393
I'm getting you out of here.

01:16:36.224 --> 01:16:38.193
No, Jack.
It's too late for me now.

01:16:39.327 --> 01:16:41.363
Look at me.

01:16:41.395 --> 01:16:43.097
Damn it, Jack, look at me!

01:16:45.733 --> 01:16:47.735
You have to shut it down now,

01:16:48.368 --> 01:16:49.737
or you will all die.

01:16:59.413 --> 01:17:01.750
You have to shut it down
before they see you.

01:17:04.851 --> 01:17:07.756
"They"? What do you
mean, "They"?

01:17:14.295 --> 01:17:17.632
Hurry, Jack.
You don't have much time.

01:17:35.048 --> 01:17:36.652
<i>Hello, Jack.</i>

01:17:42.189 --> 01:17:45.192
<i>Jack, you look like you
just saw a ghost.</i>

01:17:45.225 --> 01:17:47.295
<i>Well, I can assure you
I'm alive and well.</i>

01:17:49.130 --> 01:17:51.065
<i>You look confused, Jack.</i>

01:17:52.899 --> 01:17:54.368
<i>I guess that is to be expected.</i>

01:17:54.402 --> 01:17:58.239
It was you?
This was all you?

01:17:59.073 --> 01:18:02.477
<i>No, not just me.</i>

01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:05.814
<i>You see, Jack, there's a group of us
that saw a widespread epidemic</i>

01:18:05.846 --> 01:18:08.282
<i>beginning to
spiral out of control.</i>

01:18:08.315 --> 01:18:11.385
<i>Thus, we took it upon
ourselves to do something about it.</i>

01:18:11.418 --> 01:18:13.220
What are you talking about?

01:18:13.253 --> 01:18:15.355
<i>I'm talking about
the future, Jack.</i>

01:18:15.389 --> 01:18:18.460
<i>I'm talking about
the corporations that ran this world.</i>

01:18:18.493 --> 01:18:20.128
<i>Corporations like X-Corp.</i>

01:18:22.229 --> 01:18:27.101
<i>Too powerful and too reckless.</i>

01:18:27.135 --> 01:18:31.372
<i>You see, Jack, we have been
studying the trends for years now.</i>

01:18:31.404 --> 01:18:35.442
<i>All in an effort to
forecast the path of our society,</i>

01:18:35.475 --> 01:18:38.979
<i>to try to figure out
where it was all going.</i>

01:18:39.012 --> 01:18:43.217
<i>And what we discovered,
well, it was troubling.</i>

01:18:43.251 --> 01:18:47.822
<i>You see, there comes a point
where technology becomes dangerous.</i>

01:18:47.854 --> 01:18:52.493
<i>It becomes a disease that
grows and spirals out of control.</i>

01:18:52.527 --> 01:18:54.730
<i>If left untreated,</i>

01:18:56.329 --> 01:18:58.800
<i>well, it can
destroy everything.</i>

01:18:58.832 --> 01:19:03.137
<i>Therefore, it must be stopped,
and everything that it has infected</i>

01:19:04.104 --> 01:19:05.773
<i>must be killed.</i>

01:19:05.806 --> 01:19:07.806
<i>Do you see where
I'm going with this, Jack?</i>

01:19:08.341 --> 01:19:09.676
You're insane.

01:19:09.710 --> 01:19:14.282
<i>Come on, Jack.
I'm not insane. I'm a realist.</i>

01:19:14.314 --> 01:19:16.550
<i>The numbers don't lie,
you know that.</i>

01:19:16.583 --> 01:19:18.853
<i>We've added it all up,
and it became clear.</i>

01:19:18.886 --> 01:19:23.024
<i>We had to act now, or the age
of man would cease to exist,</i>

01:19:23.056 --> 01:19:25.926
<i>replaced by
the age of machine.</i>

01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:28.363
<i>An age of artificial
intelligence.</i>

01:19:34.301 --> 01:19:38.072
<i>You know that virus we sent you?
It was never meant to infiltrate</i>

01:19:38.104 --> 01:19:39.273
<i>the enemy's mainframe,</i>

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:41.877
<i>it was meant
to infiltrate yours.</i>

01:19:43.010 --> 01:19:45.113
<i>We needed an army, Jack.</i>

01:19:45.145 --> 01:19:47.514
<i>An army that would listen
and obey our commands.</i>

01:19:47.547 --> 01:19:49.550
<i>Never second-guess an order.</i>

01:19:49.583 --> 01:19:52.420
<i>An army that was capable
of the task at hand.</i>

01:19:52.453 --> 01:19:53.988
What task?

01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:56.056
<i>To cleanse the Earth,
to start over.</i>

01:20:03.331 --> 01:20:04.565
<i>I can see you're upset.</i>

01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:08.236
<i>Look, I've always
liked you, Jack.</i>

01:20:08.269 --> 01:20:09.537
<i>All right? I'm sorry
it had to come to this,</i>

01:20:09.570 --> 01:20:13.207
<i>but it's important you know
it was never personal.</i>

01:20:15.475 --> 01:20:18.979
I find it very personal,
Mr. President.

01:20:19.012 --> 01:20:20.414
<i>I'm sorry you feel that way.</i>

01:20:25.552 --> 01:20:28.155
<i>I wouldn't do that
if I was you, Jack.</i>

01:20:28.189 --> 01:20:31.192
<i>That system is the only thing
keeping your sister alive.</i>

01:20:31.225 --> 01:20:34.195
Don't listen to him, Jack. There's
nothing you can do for me now.

01:20:36.162 --> 01:20:39.067
Whether you hit the switch or not,
I'm already dead.

01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:40.635
You know that.

01:20:40.667 --> 01:20:44.471
<i>Think about it, Jack. At best
you win this small battle,</i>

01:20:44.505 --> 01:20:48.877
<i>but there are other systems, more
machines. We will find you eventually.</i>

01:20:48.909 --> 01:20:51.945
<i>Why delay the inevitable?
Why prolong the suffering?</i>

01:20:51.979 --> 01:20:54.149
<i>Why not just die?</i>

01:20:56.917 --> 01:21:00.955
Because...
I need to find you first.

01:21:03.291 --> 01:21:06.528
<i>All right, Jack,
have it your way.</i>

01:21:12.667 --> 01:21:13.969
Jack?

01:21:33.688 --> 01:21:35.568
You weren't
fast enough, Jack.

01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:44.564
No!

01:22:32.145 --> 01:22:33.681
<i>Can I ask you
a question?</i>

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:37.652
You're not gonna
leave me, are you?

01:22:42.555 --> 01:22:45.058
Of course not.

01:22:45.091 --> 01:22:46.811
Why would you say
something like that?

01:22:49.796 --> 01:22:51.131
Promise?

01:22:55.435 --> 01:22:56.637
Cross my heart.

01:23:00.274 --> 01:23:01.643
You ready to die?

01:23:17.824 --> 01:23:19.293
You bitch.

01:23:22.796 --> 01:23:24.364
You haven't seen anything yet.

01:23:44.618 --> 01:23:47.255
Hey, bitch.

01:23:47.287 --> 01:23:49.528
You didn't think it was going
to be that easy, did you?

01:24:30.463 --> 01:24:32.199
No!

01:27:09.023 --> 01:27:10.625
You came back!

01:27:18.698 --> 01:27:19.933
I promised you I would.

01:27:23.904 --> 01:27:25.740
<i>We buried
what was left of the bodies,</i>

01:27:25.773 --> 01:27:27.507
<i>then loaded our gear.</i>

01:27:29.376 --> 01:27:31.279
<i>And though our future
may look grim at best,</i>

01:27:32.445 --> 01:27:34.948
<i>one thing is certain.</i>

01:27:34.981 --> 01:27:38.985
<i>We will never give up,
never stop fighting...</i>

01:27:39.019 --> 01:27:40.921
<i>Because somewhere out there,
there's a group of men</i>

01:27:40.953 --> 01:27:43.323
<i>that took it upon themselves
to play God.</i>

01:27:47.895 --> 01:27:49.530
<i>And now, they all must die.</i>
