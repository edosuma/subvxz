02:10.800 --> 02:13.121
Get down! Get down!

02:13.240 --> 02:14.300
Don't move!

02:14.400 --> 02:15.686
FBI! Don't move!

02:17.400 --> 02:18.561
Get down! Get down!

02:18.800 --> 02:21.280
Where are the hostages?
Where are the hostages?

02:21.840 --> 02:23.860
- FBI, Police! Don't move!
- Down! Stay down!

02:23.960 --> 02:26.566
Cross your legs! Cross your legs
and put your hands in the air!

02:27.120 --> 02:31.125
Police! Don't move! Police! Don't move!
Get down! Get down!

02:31.920 --> 02:33.888
- Clear!
- Police! Search warrant. Don't move!

02:35.560 --> 02:36.925
- Steppin' out!
- Police, don't move!

02:38.240 --> 02:40.049
Police, don't move! Search warrant!

02:42.120 --> 02:43.246
FBI!

02:50.240 --> 02:51.287
Are you hit?

02:51.400 --> 02:52.447
I'm good.

02:53.040 --> 02:53.980
Fuck!

02:54.080 --> 02:55.445
Front, you're clear!

02:56.040 --> 02:57.451
Team leader! Status?

02:57.640 --> 02:59.085
- Front clear!
- We're clear, ma'am!

02:59.320 --> 03:00.845
Two suspects in custody!

03:07.080 --> 03:08.605
- You okay, Macer?
- Yeah.

03:09.840 --> 03:12.047
Why'd he shoot? There's no one here.

03:13.680 --> 03:14.966
Whoa...

03:18.800 --> 03:20.564
What the fuck?

04:02.240 --> 04:03.366
Jesus!

04:12.520 --> 04:14.090
Those weren't our hostages.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.521
No. That was somethin' else.

04:18.480 --> 04:19.540
- Macer?
- Yeah?

04:19.640 --> 04:21.899
U.S. Attorney wants a statement.
What do you want me to say to her?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.081
The truth.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.170
Looks like Sonora.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.407
Yeah.

05:21.640 --> 05:22.801
How many, total?

05:23.600 --> 05:27.002
We've got 15 in this hall here,
about 20 in the back bedroom.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.050
We haven't even checked the attic
or under the crawl space.

05:30.240 --> 05:32.242
Call DOJ, let 'em know what we have.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.924
This one of the houses
owned by Manuel Diaz?

05:38.240 --> 05:40.641
No way to connect him, but he owns it.

05:43.600 --> 05:44.601
Jesus Christ.

05:46.160 --> 05:47.844
Reg, step out. It's okay.

06:12.920 --> 06:15.048
Vickers! I need bolt cutters!

06:25.280 --> 06:26.281
Vickers!

06:27.160 --> 06:28.525
PD found something.

07:36.560 --> 07:37.561
Relax.

07:44.680 --> 07:45.681
Relax.

07:48.040 --> 07:50.850
Such a heavy body count
this close to Phoenix,

07:51.240 --> 07:54.540
is without a doubt a major escalation
for the cartels.

07:54.640 --> 07:58.620
There will be pressure in Washington
to explain how such a dramatic outrage

07:58.720 --> 08:02.008
could happen so deep inside
the American heartland.

08:02.360 --> 08:04.601
We may be talking about the victims
of a turfwar,

08:04.800 --> 08:07.565
or maybe some illegal immigrants
who are tied to a ransom,

08:08.000 --> 08:11.925
but it will be some weeks before we have
a clearer picture on who the victims...

08:19.840 --> 08:21.046
What's goin' on?

08:21.680 --> 08:22.727
I have no idea.

08:23.640 --> 08:26.484
She's been leading
our kidnap response team for three years.

08:26.680 --> 08:30.127
Put her through the grinder since
she got here, and she hasn't blinked.

08:30.320 --> 08:31.765
She's in the front line.

08:31.880 --> 08:34.690
Nobody's gonna be happier than Kate
to see these guys go down.

08:34.960 --> 08:36.539
So, she's a thumper.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.860
Today was her fifth O.I.S.

08:38.960 --> 08:42.203
5-and-0, not bad for a rookie.
She never worked cases?

08:42.400 --> 08:44.368
Been kicking doors since day one.

08:44.480 --> 08:47.500
I like her already. What about the partner?
He seen any action?

08:47.600 --> 08:49.380
He's only been with us 18 months.

08:49.480 --> 08:50.860
What's his background?

08:50.960 --> 08:55.020
He's a sharp kid.
ROTC scholarship to Maryland,

08:55.120 --> 08:58.169
did a tour in Iraq,
got his law degree from UNC.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.125
He's green, but he's good.

09:01.960 --> 09:04.884
No lawyers on this train.
Just give me the girl.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.280
We did this by the book, right?

09:07.520 --> 09:08.806
Come on, of course.

09:17.720 --> 09:19.051
- Jesus.
- What?

09:20.200 --> 09:21.440
Oh, shit.

09:21.680 --> 09:22.761
Would you step in here, Kate?

09:35.920 --> 09:39.641
Quite a find today,
the loss of two officers notwithstanding.

09:40.920 --> 09:42.081
Yes, sir.

09:42.560 --> 09:45.530
How familiar are you
with Manuel Diaz's operation?

09:45.920 --> 09:49.641
His company, Sun Oasis,
has 80 or so foreclosure properties.

09:49.920 --> 09:52.082
He has other legitimate businesses.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.649
But he's rumored to be linked
with one of the Mexican cartels.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.971
Manuel Diaz works for the Sonora Cartel.

09:59.240 --> 10:01.561
He's most likely their senior member
in the United States.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.689
What do you know about his brother?

10:05.160 --> 10:06.730
I wasn't aware he had one.

10:06.960 --> 10:09.850
Guillermo.
His brother's name is Guillermo.

10:09.960 --> 10:11.260
Do you know anything about his cousin?

10:11.360 --> 10:13.620
I didn't know he had one of those either.
None of that is in his file.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.609
His cousin is Fausto Alarcon.

10:16.840 --> 10:18.180
I don't know who that is.

10:18.280 --> 10:20.060
No one does. He's off the grid.

10:20.160 --> 10:22.083
He's number three in the Sonora Cartel.

10:22.840 --> 10:24.490
This is not my department, sir.

10:24.600 --> 10:27.171
Like I said,
Agent Macer doesn't work narcotics.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.442
She runs a kidnap response team.

10:29.800 --> 10:30.881
Are you married?

10:32.160 --> 10:33.400
Am I married?

10:33.720 --> 10:35.370
Do you have a husband?

10:37.840 --> 10:38.921
Divorced.

10:41.280 --> 10:42.327
Kids?

10:43.600 --> 10:44.681
No.

10:45.840 --> 10:46.841
Anything else?

10:49.560 --> 10:52.450
No. Thanks, Kate.
If you could wait outside, please.

10:58.960 --> 11:00.485
- Well?
- I have no clue.

11:05.440 --> 11:07.249
Who are those people? You know?

11:09.400 --> 11:10.447
No idea.

11:20.240 --> 11:21.765
Thanks for coming in, guys.

11:24.360 --> 11:26.010
Will you come back in, Kate?

11:29.760 --> 11:34.766
DOJ wants advisors that focus on cartels
involved in pursuing Mr. Diaz.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.800
This is Matt Graver.
He'll be leading the team.

11:38.560 --> 11:40.881
Isn't this Phoenix homicide now?

11:41.000 --> 11:44.368
No, we're expanding
the scope of the investigation a bit.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.340
You'll act as a liaison.

11:46.440 --> 11:47.487
What does that mean?

11:47.600 --> 11:51.100
They need an agent
with tactical experience, like you.

11:51.200 --> 11:53.460
State Department
is pulling an agent from the field

11:53.560 --> 11:56.723
that specializes in responding
to escalated cartel activity.

11:57.200 --> 11:59.202
You'll be part of the team.

11:59.320 --> 12:02.085
You'll meet up with them
at Luke tomorrow?

12:02.200 --> 12:03.380
Day after. Early.

12:03.480 --> 12:04.481
Air Force Base?

12:04.600 --> 12:05.840
Yeah, we're gonna go see Guillermo.

12:06.040 --> 12:07.300
Diaz's brother?

12:07.400 --> 12:08.811
That's the one.

12:10.440 --> 12:11.441
Where is he?

12:11.680 --> 12:14.923
He's in the El Paso area.

12:17.640 --> 12:18.880
What's our objective?

12:23.160 --> 12:24.969
To dramatically overreact.

12:26.880 --> 12:31.329
Kate, you must volunteer
for an inter-agency task force.

12:32.880 --> 12:34.928
Think very hard before you respond.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.850
You wanna be a part of this?

12:40.080 --> 12:43.163
Do we get an opportunity
at the men responsible for today?

12:46.920 --> 12:49.526
The men who were really responsible
for today, yeah.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.245
I'll volunteer.

13:09.600 --> 13:10.840
Papa!

13:22.400 --> 13:23.561
SÃ­.

13:25.480 --> 13:26.527
No.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.580
You keep an eye on that doughy prick
with the flip-flops.

14:54.680 --> 14:55.681
Don't trust him.

14:58.880 --> 14:59.980
How you doin', sir?

15:00.080 --> 15:01.320
I.D.'s?

15:09.040 --> 15:10.980
She's on the list, but you're not.

15:11.080 --> 15:12.127
Well, what's she supposed to do?

15:12.360 --> 15:13.486
I need you to turn this around for me.

15:13.600 --> 15:14.931
It's fine. It's good.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.260
I'll call you when we're headed back.

15:17.360 --> 15:18.521
All right.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.740
- Morning.
- Morning. Am I late?

15:41.840 --> 15:44.286
No, no, no. We just landed.
Come on, this way.

15:45.960 --> 15:48.611
My bird dog over there, Alejandro.

15:52.800 --> 15:53.820
We're taking this?

15:53.920 --> 15:56.082
Yeah. Only the best for you.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.300
DOD flies you around
in private jets now?

16:12.400 --> 16:13.940
Yeah. You guys don't have one of these?

16:14.040 --> 16:15.246
Right.

16:18.080 --> 16:19.969
Is there any food on this flight?

16:20.080 --> 16:24.642
Some bitchin' peanuts in the back.
But it's kind of a self-serve deal.

16:35.760 --> 16:37.000
Kate Macer.

16:38.160 --> 16:39.605
Have you been to JuÃ¡rez before?

16:41.640 --> 16:44.883
No, I... We're goin' to El Paso, right?

16:45.080 --> 16:48.163
Yeah, amazing. Okay.

18:13.600 --> 18:14.681
Are you okay?

18:17.560 --> 18:20.609
Yeah. I'm fine.

18:28.080 --> 18:29.286
So...

18:30.280 --> 18:31.884
So, this is your specialty?

18:33.440 --> 18:36.171
The cartels in Mexico
are your specialty?

18:36.360 --> 18:38.442
Yeah. Yeah.

18:42.200 --> 18:43.611
Is there anything I should know?

18:45.600 --> 18:47.841
You're asking me how a watch works.

18:50.360 --> 18:52.522
For now, just keep an eye on the time.

18:56.720 --> 18:57.881
Okay.

19:10.120 --> 19:11.140
How you doin'?

19:11.240 --> 19:13.004
Howdy! How you been?

19:13.200 --> 19:15.168
Good, buddy. How you feelin'?

19:15.360 --> 19:17.761
Well, when I pee, it burns.

19:18.680 --> 19:20.045
Maybe it's gonorrhea.

19:20.680 --> 19:22.091
What color is it?

19:22.560 --> 19:24.164
Yellow with red specks.

19:24.760 --> 19:26.091
Red specks or blood?

19:28.560 --> 19:31.723
I'm tryin' to get DOD to let me look
into this conspiracy to sink Fiji.

19:31.920 --> 19:32.921
- Fiji?
- Yeah.

19:33.200 --> 19:34.690
Leave Fiji alone, terrorists!

19:34.880 --> 19:38.089
Exactly. I figure a month or two over there,
we'll get it all worked out.

19:38.600 --> 19:40.125
So, who's goin' over there today?

19:40.240 --> 19:42.460
Marshals, DEA...
I pulled a team for you, Matt.

19:42.560 --> 19:45.006
Oh, man, I love it when you say "a team."
It makes me all warm and fuzzy.

19:45.240 --> 19:48.540
They're a crack bunch, too.
Just rotated back from Afghanistan.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.529
Where's everybody linkin' up?

19:51.040 --> 19:52.451
A.I.C.

19:53.040 --> 19:54.804
Good, good, good.

20:05.880 --> 20:08.740
Mexican Federal Police
will meet you at the border,

20:08.840 --> 20:11.650
and proceed with you to the courthouse,
located here.

20:13.720 --> 20:15.484
This is a high-level target.

20:18.600 --> 20:22.780
The most likely spots for an attempt
will be at the exchange,

20:22.880 --> 20:25.406
and at the border crossing
on the return.

20:26.480 --> 20:27.925
The Marshals will enter...

20:28.600 --> 20:30.443
Kevin, Keith, you wanna stand up?

20:32.240 --> 20:34.540
Now, the Marshals' response team
is in Laredo...

20:34.640 --> 20:35.721
Love Texans.

20:36.520 --> 20:38.761
...so our friends from Delta
have volunteered to come along,

20:38.880 --> 20:41.531
and will escort the Marshals
on the exchange.

20:42.160 --> 20:43.924
And here's the man of the hour.

20:44.600 --> 20:45.931
You comin' with or waitin' here?

20:46.120 --> 20:48.620
We'll take the tour with you.
Loan us a couple pop guns.

20:48.720 --> 20:50.820
All right, this is turnin'
into an all-star affair!

20:50.920 --> 20:52.604
Keith, you want another hand
on the exchange?

20:52.800 --> 20:53.801
You sober?

20:54.520 --> 20:56.204
Will be by the time we get there.

20:56.440 --> 20:58.681
Got a bottle in the truck
in case your hands get shaky.

20:58.880 --> 21:00.450
I know I could always
count on you, Keith.

21:00.640 --> 21:02.380
All right, we'll gear you up
as soon as we're done here.

21:02.480 --> 21:06.820
Now, Matt, you can be the tip of the spear,
and we don't have to rob a guy from Delta.

21:06.920 --> 21:08.900
Now, be careful on the turnaround.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.446
If the Federale's a shooter,
it's gonna happen on the turnaround.

21:12.200 --> 21:14.300
Delta's Team One
will be the lead vehicle.

21:14.400 --> 21:18.580
We can divide Team Two between the
carry car and the trail vehicle. That okay?

21:18.680 --> 21:20.340
Good. Now, Delta,
if you can identify yourselves,

21:20.440 --> 21:23.364
so everyone knows who to hide behind
if shit hits the fan.

21:24.040 --> 21:28.523
The most likely spot for a hit will be
at the border crossing on the return.

21:29.400 --> 21:33.405
Anywhere along the way, anyone not
in this room is a potential shooter.

21:35.080 --> 21:37.560
The op isn't over
until we get back here.

21:38.320 --> 21:39.446
Okay?

21:40.280 --> 21:43.284
Be alert. Be vigilant.
And be aware. Let's go.

21:44.920 --> 21:46.126
What?

21:53.280 --> 21:56.170
Hey! I thought you were in prison.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.526
They took me out.

21:57.920 --> 21:59.365
They needed somebody for this job.

21:59.640 --> 22:01.404
For good behavior or bad behavior?

22:08.800 --> 22:10.165
Have you ever been over there?

22:12.200 --> 22:13.884
I worked in JuÃ¡rez.

22:17.160 --> 22:18.525
For the DEA?

22:19.400 --> 22:20.481
No.

22:22.040 --> 22:23.121
For who?

22:23.240 --> 22:24.526
For Mexico.

22:25.800 --> 22:27.290
I was a prosecutor.

22:31.520 --> 22:32.931
You're not American?

22:33.200 --> 22:34.180
No.

22:34.280 --> 22:35.691
Who do you work for now?

22:37.520 --> 22:39.204
I go where I'm sent.

22:40.680 --> 22:42.205
Where were you sent from?

22:43.880 --> 22:45.211
Cartagena.

22:47.400 --> 22:48.526
Colombia.

22:50.520 --> 22:51.681
Listen...

22:52.680 --> 22:55.331
Nothing will make sense
to your American ears.

22:57.480 --> 22:59.608
And you will doubt
everything that we do.

23:01.160 --> 23:04.767
But in the end, you will understand.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.528
Here, try this on. See if it fits.

23:13.840 --> 23:15.968
Is he CIA? Are you?

23:17.160 --> 23:19.003
He's a DOD advisor, just like me.

23:19.200 --> 23:20.340
No, he's not.

23:20.440 --> 23:23.284
Just pay attention to Alejandro.
If he says to do somethin', just do it.

23:23.480 --> 23:25.721
I'm not authorized to follow orders
from Alejandro!

23:26.040 --> 23:27.140
Especially in Mexico!

23:27.240 --> 23:28.571
Fine. Then stay here.

23:30.520 --> 23:31.780
But you don't want to, do you?

23:31.880 --> 23:33.644
I just wanna know what I'm getting into.

23:35.080 --> 23:38.180
Kate, you volunteered to get
on this train because you know

23:38.280 --> 23:42.330
you're doing nothing in Phoenix.
You're just sweeping up a fucking mess.

23:43.080 --> 23:46.687
In six months, every single house you raid
will be rigged with explosives.

23:46.880 --> 23:49.260
Do you want to find the guys responsible?
Yes or no?

23:49.360 --> 23:50.380
Yes.

23:50.480 --> 23:51.641
- Yes?
- Yes!

23:53.640 --> 23:55.051
This is where we start.

23:56.240 --> 23:57.480
Try it on.

25:43.600 --> 25:44.931
There she is.

25:45.640 --> 25:46.926
The beast.

25:47.480 --> 25:48.811
JuÃ¡rez.

25:51.840 --> 25:52.966
You know,

25:53.760 --> 25:57.560
1900s, President Taft
went to visit President DÃ­az.

25:58.160 --> 26:00.208
Took 4,000 men with him.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.803
And it almost was called off.

26:03.160 --> 26:05.049
Some guy had a pistol.

26:05.200 --> 26:08.220
Was gonna walk right up to Taft
and just blow his brains out.

26:08.320 --> 26:11.563
But it was avoided. 4,000 troops!

26:12.600 --> 26:14.170
Think he felt safe?

28:29.800 --> 28:31.529
Welcome to JuÃ¡rez.

29:10.920 --> 29:12.331
It's brilliant what they do.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.843
When they mutilate a body like that,

29:16.920 --> 29:18.780
they make people think
they must have been involved,

29:18.880 --> 29:21.929
they must have deserved such a death
'cause they did something.

29:23.320 --> 29:25.004
It's brilliant what they do.

29:47.280 --> 29:48.406
You hear that?

29:50.120 --> 29:51.645
Those aren't firecrackers.

29:54.240 --> 29:55.685
Mexicans are adjusting our route.

29:55.880 --> 29:59.043
There's activity ahead,
we need to go around. Everyone hold on.

31:29.360 --> 31:30.850
Nothing will happen here.

31:32.360 --> 31:33.930
They try anything,
it will be at the border.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.367
Keep an eye out for the State Police.

31:45.360 --> 31:47.522
They're not always the good guys.

32:31.800 --> 32:33.564
Spotter vehicle, left lane. Left lane!

32:33.800 --> 32:35.325
Spotter vehicle, nine o'clock.

32:35.880 --> 32:37.450
I'm gettin' a boner.

32:38.440 --> 32:39.726
Is that one of ours?

32:40.080 --> 32:41.605
Watch the right, watch the right.

32:42.080 --> 32:43.491
No, that's a lone wolf.

32:50.680 --> 32:52.011
Eyes on rooftops.

32:59.320 --> 33:00.481
Nothing.

33:00.800 --> 33:01.926
Rooftops clear.

33:03.880 --> 33:08.408
Bridge is one klick out. Road is secure.
Hotfoot it, gentlemen.

33:16.280 --> 33:18.681
Everyone stay in this lane.
Our agents at the border are

33:18.880 --> 33:21.281
waving traffic through
to get us over as quickly as they can.

33:34.040 --> 33:35.690
Everyone stay frosty.

33:41.200 --> 33:43.441
Okay, it's a fuck-up.
What are we gonna do now?

33:48.440 --> 33:51.523
Here's the deal.
A car broke down up ahead.

33:52.320 --> 33:55.847
It's being sorted out,
but it's gonna take a while. Stand by.

34:29.159 --> 34:30.161
Get your service weapon out.

34:32.880 --> 34:35.860
Red Impala, two lanes over, on my ten.

34:35.960 --> 34:39.362
Copy that. Red Impala, two lanes left.

34:40.159 --> 34:41.241
Roger that.

34:52.199 --> 34:55.283
Three lanes left.
Seven o'clock. Green Civic.

35:05.280 --> 35:06.725
Bring your window down.

35:13.960 --> 35:15.086
Gun.

35:15.320 --> 35:16.924
Gun! Gun left!

35:17.080 --> 35:18.127
What are the rules here?

35:19.360 --> 35:21.169
We must be engaged to engage.

35:22.360 --> 35:25.284
Permission to get out of the vehicle
and set a perimeter?

35:25.640 --> 35:26.780
Stay in your vehicle.

35:26.880 --> 35:30.043
You can do what they do.
If they get out, you get out.

35:51.320 --> 35:53.860
Get ready.
They can see our lane clearing.

35:53.960 --> 35:55.405
If it's coming, it's coming now.

36:12.280 --> 36:13.281
Move!

36:13.440 --> 36:14.420
Wait, wait, wait!

36:14.520 --> 36:15.521
Get outta the car.

36:17.240 --> 36:18.446
Jesus Christ!

36:31.880 --> 36:32.881
Don't move!

36:34.120 --> 36:35.167
No, no, no, no!

36:54.600 --> 36:55.931
What the fuck are we doing?

37:17.520 --> 37:18.521
Fuck!

37:18.840 --> 37:20.251
Lane's clear! The lane's clear!

37:20.400 --> 37:21.447
Don't look at me!

37:21.560 --> 37:25.281
Put your hands behind your head! Go!
Hands behind your head!

37:25.480 --> 37:26.845
- All clear!
- I got this!

37:27.200 --> 37:28.770
Go, go, go!

37:32.000 --> 37:33.490
Move, move, move!

37:34.080 --> 37:37.129
This is gonna be on the front page
of every newspaper in America.

37:37.320 --> 37:40.563
No, it won't. It won't even
make the papers in El Paso.

37:44.040 --> 37:45.041
Clear!

38:32.960 --> 38:34.340
Got a little nutty, huh?

38:34.440 --> 38:37.364
Nutty? Yeah, that was fucking illegal.

38:37.560 --> 38:40.291
You wanna start a war?
You're a fucking spook!

38:40.520 --> 38:42.841
And him! I mean, who the fuck is that?

38:43.040 --> 38:44.180
Told you, you could stay here.

38:44.280 --> 38:47.300
Jesus Christ.
You just spray bullets at...

38:47.400 --> 38:49.420
Yeah, sure, there's just
fucking civilians everywhere.

38:49.520 --> 38:51.340
I'm not a soldier!
This is not what I do!

38:51.440 --> 38:54.140
Whoa! Don't sell yourself short,
all right?

38:54.240 --> 38:57.100
The reason Reggie's home is
I know he wasn't ready for this.

38:57.200 --> 39:00.820
But he better get ready real quick
because this is the future, Kate!

39:00.920 --> 39:03.420
JuÃ¡rez is what happens when they dig in.
This is it!

39:03.520 --> 39:04.500
What am I doing here?

39:04.600 --> 39:06.780
What you're doing here is
you're giving us the opportunity

39:06.880 --> 39:09.804
to shake the tree and create chaos.
That's what this is!

39:11.880 --> 39:14.963
In the meantime,
just sponge everything up you see.

39:15.080 --> 39:17.048
Learn! That's why you're here.

39:40.320 --> 39:41.924
Guillermo...

39:45.480 --> 39:48.131
You're giving him a belly
full of water, you devil.

39:53.280 --> 39:55.362
You didn't think
we'd get you here, did you?

39:56.640 --> 39:57.860
No hablo InglÃ©s.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.610
No hablo InglÃ©s?

40:04.400 --> 40:06.846
I love it when they no hablo InglÃ©s.

40:08.600 --> 40:11.171
You know, I brought
an old buddy of yours.

40:12.280 --> 40:15.648
I bet you hablo to him. Yeah.

40:24.240 --> 40:26.481
I didn't know ghosts got thirsty.

40:32.080 --> 40:34.811
I know someone kept him alive for us.

40:37.560 --> 40:39.369
I doubt it was easy.

40:40.080 --> 40:41.605
What's easy these days?

40:42.800 --> 40:44.848
I'm sorry about
what happened on the return.

40:44.960 --> 40:46.644
I control only what I can.

40:48.440 --> 40:49.646
It's not your fault.

41:06.600 --> 41:08.204
There's rumors of a tunnel.

41:08.960 --> 41:11.406
Fausto's main road into Arizona.

41:12.160 --> 41:15.780
If you're doing what I think you're doing,
that's the best place to cross.

41:15.880 --> 41:19.168
If you can find it.
But time is against you.

41:19.560 --> 41:22.166
In three days,
nobody will be where they are today.

41:23.800 --> 41:24.780
Shall we?

41:24.880 --> 41:29.010
No, it's better if you don't.
Something happens in that room,

41:31.360 --> 41:33.124
it's easier to say
you didn't see anything.

42:42.120 --> 42:44.600
Well, Alejandro,
I think he remembers you.

42:46.320 --> 42:47.810
I'm gonna step out.

42:48.160 --> 42:49.161
Timmy.

43:12.240 --> 43:14.208
What do you keep lookin' at me for?

43:15.120 --> 43:17.009
No hablo InglÃ©s, remember?

43:20.200 --> 43:21.201
No, no.

43:44.480 --> 43:46.084
Can I have one of those?

43:46.840 --> 43:48.080
Thank you.

44:08.440 --> 44:09.930
- You like fireworks?
- Huh?

44:10.560 --> 44:12.085
Wanna see something cool?

44:12.720 --> 44:13.721
Come on.

44:48.880 --> 44:49.927
Here we go.

44:54.360 --> 44:55.771
Look right there.

45:11.680 --> 45:13.045
Unbelievable.

45:13.240 --> 45:16.020
That's what happens when
you chop the head off a chicken.

45:16.120 --> 45:17.121
Yeah.

45:18.200 --> 45:19.690
I can see.

45:21.920 --> 45:23.843
Can you get 'em all in one place?

45:24.480 --> 45:27.131
We just landed back in Phoenix.
I'm on the clock, I can't wait.

45:27.720 --> 45:32.140
All right, look, contact Bob Fisks.
Have him hold 'em in the staging area.

45:32.240 --> 45:34.700
How long does it take to get to Tucson?

45:34.800 --> 45:36.260
From here, it's a little over two hours.

45:36.360 --> 45:39.284
All right.
We'll be there around 2:00. Yeah.

45:41.520 --> 45:42.860
Are we going to Tucson?

45:42.960 --> 45:45.140
Yeah, you gotta learn
how to sleep on a plane.

45:45.240 --> 45:47.940
They let me on the base
when you need a ride, don't they?

45:48.040 --> 45:49.060
You okay?

45:49.160 --> 45:50.660
- She's fine.
- I didn't ask you.

45:50.760 --> 45:52.091
And yet I answered.

45:55.800 --> 45:56.801
Kate,

45:57.520 --> 45:58.521
who's that?

45:59.560 --> 46:01.005
We're goin' to Tucson.

46:36.200 --> 46:38.806
What's the deal, Matt?
Why you holdin' up my transport?

46:39.000 --> 46:40.180
Don't worry, Bob. We'll be quick.

46:40.280 --> 46:44.700
How's the auditor gonna react to
an $8,000 check to fuckin' Domino's Pizza?

46:44.800 --> 46:47.620
Don't be so dramatic, okay?
This is Kate Macer with the FBI.

46:47.720 --> 46:49.324
This is her partner, what's-his-name.
It was her call.

46:49.520 --> 46:52.364
It wasn't my call.
Have you got another one of those?

46:59.680 --> 47:01.380
Finish it before you get up there.

47:01.480 --> 47:02.481
No problem.

47:04.680 --> 47:05.681
Hey, Kate.

47:06.640 --> 47:08.768
Tell me what happened in El Paso.

47:09.000 --> 47:12.368
We weren't in El Paso.
We were in Mexico.

48:03.560 --> 48:05.642
I guess we're not following
any procedures.

48:05.840 --> 48:06.980
What do you wanna do?

48:07.080 --> 48:10.163
We want to talk to the people
caught around the Nogales area.

48:12.520 --> 48:15.649
Okay. That group.

48:18.040 --> 48:21.010
This group here. And that group.

48:22.520 --> 48:25.046
Okay. They stay and the rest can go.

48:25.560 --> 48:26.561
Josef!

48:47.400 --> 48:48.686
On the bus. Ãndale.

49:07.600 --> 49:09.523
What are we looking for?

49:11.840 --> 49:13.365
Just keep watching.

49:35.040 --> 49:36.929
- In Arizona.
- Arizona?

50:11.880 --> 50:13.723
- Arizona.
- Arizona...

50:17.880 --> 50:19.260
Talk to me. What are we doing?

50:19.360 --> 50:20.860
I don't have any answers for you.

50:20.960 --> 50:22.380
Let's get some, then.

50:22.480 --> 50:24.020
Do you think
I haven't asked these questions?

50:24.120 --> 50:25.100
Do you think you can do better?

50:25.200 --> 50:26.180
- Yeah.
- Go ahead.

50:26.280 --> 50:28.089
Matt, can we talk for a minute?

50:39.200 --> 50:40.201
What's up?

50:41.640 --> 50:42.846
Everything okay?

50:44.760 --> 50:46.125
You look very serious.

50:46.600 --> 50:49.580
There's "in the dark"
and there's the way you're treating us.

50:49.680 --> 50:51.762
I want to know the objective or I walk,
period.

50:52.720 --> 50:55.803
Then go. I didn't ask you
to be here. She did.

50:56.040 --> 50:57.485
I walk, too.

51:06.800 --> 51:09.180
- What do you wanna know?
- Everything.

51:09.280 --> 51:10.691
Fuckin' lawyers.

51:11.280 --> 51:12.327
All right.

51:14.280 --> 51:15.281
Guillermo

51:17.200 --> 51:20.488
told us about a tunnel east of Nogales,
near Sasabe.

51:21.240 --> 51:24.740
Now we're tryin' to find out
what areas near there migrants avoid,

51:24.840 --> 51:26.410
so we can find the tunnel.

51:28.720 --> 51:29.700
That better?

51:29.800 --> 51:30.780
And Guillermo is...

51:30.880 --> 51:32.860
Guillermo, he just told you
where the drug tunnel is?

51:32.960 --> 51:33.980
He just told you?

51:34.080 --> 51:35.740
Guillermo didn't have any other options.

51:35.840 --> 51:37.900
We send him back across the border,
he's a dead man.

51:38.000 --> 51:41.049
Now he gets to spend the next 30 years
in an American prison,

51:42.480 --> 51:43.580
in relative safety.

51:43.680 --> 51:45.250
Just tell us the truth, man.

51:51.680 --> 51:54.365
We are gonna make enough noise

51:55.120 --> 51:58.408
that Manuel Diaz is called back to Mexico
to see his boss.

51:59.320 --> 52:00.526
That's the truth.

52:00.760 --> 52:01.761
And then?

52:02.440 --> 52:04.408
And then we know where his boss is.

52:06.840 --> 52:10.367
His name is Fausto Alarcon El verdugo.

52:15.560 --> 52:17.130
Every day across that border,

52:17.360 --> 52:22.048
people are kidnapped or killed
by his hand or with his blessing.

52:24.560 --> 52:28.804
To find him would be like
discovering a vaccine.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.729
You understand the value of that.

52:38.680 --> 52:42.082
All right, we're good.
Just don't keep us in the dark.

52:42.520 --> 52:43.521
Great!

52:44.400 --> 52:46.050
You afraid of the dark?

52:49.680 --> 52:50.727
Hey!

52:51.280 --> 52:54.568
It's been a humdinger of a day.
Go home. Get some rest.

52:54.760 --> 52:57.604
We'll find our own ride.
We'll see you tomorrow!

52:58.040 --> 52:59.860
I just drove a hundred fucking miles.

52:59.960 --> 53:01.820
It's a fucking blessing, trust me.

53:01.920 --> 53:02.980
Got you smokin' again?

53:03.080 --> 53:04.081
Yeah.

53:05.720 --> 53:07.563
Who the fuck's Guillermo?

55:02.760 --> 55:04.888
Gotta get you a new bra, woman.

55:06.080 --> 55:07.570
The list of things I need.

55:07.760 --> 55:09.683
I'm just saying.
Some nice lacy somethin'.

55:10.440 --> 55:13.808
It's been a while since someone's
seen me in a bra, except you.

55:15.280 --> 55:18.011
Oh, God, don't look at me like that.
I don't want your pity.

55:18.120 --> 55:20.282
How was seeing Evan the other day?

55:21.160 --> 55:22.340
I don't know...

55:22.440 --> 55:24.283
- Miss him?
- Ask me something else.

55:30.000 --> 55:33.900
I used to see guys like Matt in Iraq.
Gotta be careful around these people.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.401
CIA's not supposed to
work this side of the fence.

55:36.520 --> 55:38.020
He's a DOD advisor.

55:38.120 --> 55:39.690
You really believe that?

55:42.120 --> 55:44.740
You need somebody watching your six,
'cause I promise you they aren't.

55:44.840 --> 55:46.580
You know,

55:46.680 --> 55:51.260
we're not even scratching the surface
doing what we're doing.

55:51.360 --> 55:52.361
And they are.

55:53.480 --> 55:56.484
Well, you sure
picked the motherfuckers to show us.

56:13.400 --> 56:14.845
What's the password?

56:16.080 --> 56:17.206
Moron.

56:37.080 --> 56:38.206
This is our spot.

56:38.400 --> 56:43.088
No way! No, no.

57:07.800 --> 57:09.165
Are you getting this?

57:27.400 --> 57:28.845
That's our way across.

57:30.280 --> 57:32.681
So, Guillermo was tellin' the truth?

57:34.080 --> 57:35.844
It's gonna be a good day.

57:37.480 --> 57:40.484
Hey, Kate.
Got any friends at Phoenix SWAT?

57:40.600 --> 57:42.260
Yeah, we use them
in breaches all the time.

57:42.360 --> 57:43.740
Good, 'cause we're gonna
need their help.

57:43.840 --> 57:44.860
What for?

57:44.960 --> 57:48.123
We are gonna fuck with
Manuel Diaz's wallet.

58:39.840 --> 58:43.083
This is our Smurf, guys.
Blonde hair, white purse.

58:50.480 --> 58:52.420
- You know the Heimlich?
- Oh, yeah.

58:52.520 --> 58:55.380
She tries to eat that deposit receipt,
you Heimlich it right out of her, hear me?

58:55.480 --> 58:56.481
Copy that.

59:00.880 --> 59:04.009
There she goes.
All right, go get 'em, tiger.

59:04.200 --> 59:05.281
Take 'em.

59:17.240 --> 59:18.890
Hold still! Hold still!

59:22.880 --> 59:24.006
You want bank computers for evidence?

59:24.120 --> 59:27.580
No, no. Just the money.
But freeze all his accounts, everything.

59:27.680 --> 59:30.047
Even if his dog opened an account,
I want you to freeze it.

59:36.000 --> 59:37.331
Who you got?

59:39.360 --> 59:41.203
Got a mobile money launderer.

59:45.960 --> 59:47.041
Pack it up.

59:48.000 --> 59:49.889
Come on. Come on.

59:57.440 --> 59:58.540
You coming?

59:58.640 --> 59:59.660
No, don't go in the bank.

59:59.760 --> 01:00:01.700
This is something
we can actually build a case on.

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:03.580
Don't go in the bank, Kate!

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.409
There you go,
and she's goin' in the bank.

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:24.460
These are all Manuel Diaz's accounts?

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:27.928
Yeah. Cash deposits made daily
in $9,000 increments.

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:30.260
- So, it doesn't have to be reported.
- That's right.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:31.620
And you can seize that?

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:34.980
I already have. And I'll go through
these wire transfer numbers and

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:37.048
freeze all these accounts as well.

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:39.161
Here you go.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.890
- Damn, that's smart.
- What?

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:47.689
This is a bank line of credit.

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:50.980
See, you make payments
over what you owe,

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:53.765
and it doesn't show up as cash,
it shows up as a negative loan balance.

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:58.689
It's never reported to anyone. IRS, DEA...
This money is invisible.

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:00.165
How much does he have?

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:02.406
Take a look.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:07.051
Oh, my God.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.820
They just seized $17 million.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:13.580
- It's a bogus bust, Kate.
- What?

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:16.660
You can't prosecute it. No one controls
who deposits money in an account.

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.364
An attorney will have that money back
in a few months,

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:19.971
but a lot of heads
will roll before that.

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:22.380
But we can arrest Manuel for now.
We can get him off the street.

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:25.580
We gotta get Manuel called back to Mexico.
That's the objective...

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:27.364
We have no jurisdiction in Mexico.

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:30.020
We have nothing.
We need to do something now.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.451
Can't arrest him.

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:51.291
What?

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:53.601
When?

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:57.605
Wait a minute.

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:22.860
$9,000 is deposited into this account
every day in cash,

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:24.121
for five years.

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:27.285
That's not illegal.
It's suspect, but it isn't illegal.

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:29.209
I think the IRS
might think it's illegal.

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.260
What do you want, Kate?
What would you like done here?

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:33.780
I want to follow
some semblance of procedure.

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:36.042
That's what I want.
To build a prosecutable case.

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:39.500
We prosecuted more felony drug cases
in this region last year

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:42.206
than in the two previous years combined.

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:44.641
Are you feeling that on the street?

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:47.442
You getting the vibe that we're winning?

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:52.300
No.

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.380
Do you?

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:55.720
No sir, I don't.

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:01.100
Advisors like Matt come in,
they stir the pot,

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:03.851
they cause the criminals
to react and make mistakes.

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:06.380
That's how we build cases
against the individuals

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:08.562
that actually make a difference
in this fight.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.860
It's when they're nervous,
when they stop trusting their crews,

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:13.900
when they move their money.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.889
These are all opportunities to strike.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:19.121
And that's the purpose
of people like Matt.

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:22.244
Kate, this isn't something
that I dreamed up myself.

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.940
I don't have the authority
to hire advisors,

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.660
or authorize joint agency missions,

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:31.001
or fly agents from Air Force bases.

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:34.500
Are you understanding me?

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:37.683
These decisions are made far from here

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:41.801
by officials elected to office,
not appointed to them.

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:45.940
So, if your fear is operating
out of bounds,

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:48.930
I am telling you, you are not.

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:52.643
The boundary's been moved.

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:55.726
Are we clear?

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.247
Yes, sir.

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:03.460
I need a fucking drink.

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:05.767
- Where do you wanna go?
- Anywhere.

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.140
I'm gonna go get a table.

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:44.924
- I guess it's on me.
- Thanks.

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:50.288
- What'll it be?
- Two beers.

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:12.721
Thank you.

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:30.642
I want a cigarette so bad.

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:37.961
Macer?

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:39.970
Yeah?

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:42.208
I hate to go on about this,

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:45.660
but I think the bra situation's
the least of your problems.

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:46.807
Okay...

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:48.763
'Cause you look like shit.

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:51.929
You do. You look like shit.
Everybody on the team's talkin' about it.

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:54.380
They're like, "Kate used to be
a number one draft pick.

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:56.244
"Now look at her.
She looks like fuckin' shit."

01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:58.340
Look at you. Your eyebrows are a mess.

01:05:58.440 --> 01:05:59.580
No, they're not!

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:02.140
They're like caterpillars, like wild beasts.
You're losing weight...

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.260
I'm eating.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:05.580
Look at you.
What is it, one T-shirt a week?

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:08.100
At least work
on your personal hygiene, huh?

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.247
You sound like my mother.

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:10.725
Maybe I am your mother.

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:14.740
First we work on personal hygiene,
then we move on to the shopping.

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:17.540
Get you some potatoes, yeah?
Eat some food...

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.642
Where have you taken me?
What is this place?

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:21.966
It's a bar.

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:23.286
It's full o' cowboys.

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:24.847
I'm a cowboy.

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:26.220
You're a redneck.

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:29.900
I'm a redneck. Got a trailer.
Got a wife.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.140
What are you talking about?

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:32.924
I got a trailer, I got a wife.
She's my sister.

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:35.961
Hey, Reg.

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:38.169
- Ted!
- What's goin' on?

01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:40.180
- Long time. How you been?
- Yeah, it's good to see you, man.

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:41.420
Good to see you, too. How you been?

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.660
Gettin' your groove on, huh?

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:44.260
We're just startin'. We just got here.

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:47.364
All right. You gonna introduce me, man?

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:49.523
Ted, Phoenix PD, Kate, my partner.

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:50.846
How you doin'? Just Ted, it's fine.

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.020
I saw you play softball once.

01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:54.167
Softball?

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:56.940
She was at the game, Ted.

01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:58.405
"The game?"

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.762
Where you struck out
in slow-pitch softball.

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:02.610
You played really, really well.

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:03.847
I appreciate that.

01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:07.681
I'm gonna head back to that bar now.
Can I get y'all another round?

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:09.166
Yeah, sure.

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:10.407
All right.

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:13.925
Ted, he's a good guy.

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:17.967
Divorced.

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:36.651
Just give me one second,
I'll be right with you.

01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:40.326
All right...

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:02.220
Just wait, wait a second...

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:04.243
What, what? Is it too much?

01:09:04.439 --> 01:09:06.249
Just wait one minute.
I just need a second.

01:09:06.439 --> 01:09:08.488
All right. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:17.380
Hey, Kate?

01:09:17.479 --> 01:09:21.041
Hey! Hey, come here,
stop, stop, talk to me.

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:25.370
Just talk to me. Okay?
Relax. Okay? Just take it...

01:09:25.479 --> 01:09:27.130
Whoa, shit! Kate...

01:09:28.279 --> 01:09:31.124
What is it? What? Stop.

01:09:31.319 --> 01:09:33.209
Stop. Stop.

01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:35.404
Shit, what the fuck! What did you...

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:38.923
- Don't...
- What the fuck are you...

01:09:40.479 --> 01:09:41.560
God damn!

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:45.767
You fuckin' try to shoot me?
You fuckin' crazy?

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.804
- Stop that!
- Get off me!

01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:53.367
Fuck that...

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.243
Damn it, Kate! Just fucking stop!

01:09:58.720 --> 01:09:59.721
Stop!

01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:07.568
Stop, bitch! Stop! Fuck!

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:10.723
Fuckin' stop!

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:15.643
Stop.

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:19.681
Fuck!

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:26.845
This is you, you hear me? You did this.
You did this.

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:04.165
You used me as bait.

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.808
Nah, you used yourself as bait.

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:10.245
I told you not to go in the bank.

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:16.445
You brought him back here, though.
That was smart.

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:19.371
Yeah. Love how
we're gonna pretend like I planned this.

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:22.040
Why don't you just write that
in your report.

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:24.603
Come on! This is good news!

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.843
They're gonna call Manuel back soon.

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:30.725
Isn't that the point?

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:46.410
It's okay, Reg.

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:51.180
I thought he was a friend.

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:52.281
I know.

01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:59.171
- Want me to stay tonight?
- No. I'm good.

01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:00.766
- You sure?
- I'm good.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:08.245
How y'all want me to talk to you
when you keep fuckin' hittin' me?

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:13.180
How many other corrupt motherfuckers are
you workin' with on this side of the border?

01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:15.487
All right. Look...

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.685
It's exactly what I told you, all right?

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:24.620
They came to me
and they wanted details about our case,

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:28.167
and yes, I did it, I gave it to them,
but I never wanted anybody to get hurt.

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:30.020
I would have never gotten involved
with them pieces of shit

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:31.121
if I thought that there was any...

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:35.848
Fuck! Okay! Fuck! Okay!

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:40.602
"Okay, okay, okay,"
is not what we're lookin' for, Ted.

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:45.564
You know what the beauty is
of you being so beat to a pulp?

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:49.287
'Cause no one's gonna notice
a few more scratches.

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.210
This is a new deal, Ted.

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:58.641
I'm the one who decides whether
your daughter'll get Federal protection,

01:12:58.760 --> 01:12:59.761
Fuck...

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:02.963
or whether we post
your ex-wife's address on the Internet.

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:09.287
I decide whether you go to prison
in a work camp in Missouri,

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:12.045
or a kill house like Corcoran.

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:14.201
All right.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.765
This is where you negotiate
how to survive, my friend.

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.847
Okay. Look...

01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:27.886
I feel like this whole thing's
just gotten away from me...

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:33.402
I fucked up. Okay, I fucked up
and I'm in over my fuckin' head right now.

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:35.420
I'm sorry...

01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:38.330
Fuck it! Get it out!
Get it the fuck out!

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:43.681
Fuck! Get it the fuck out! Get it out!

01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:46.281
Motherfucker! And fuck you!

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:47.841
Fuck!

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:52.131
How many officers
do they have working on the force?

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:56.169
I'll tell you anything you wanna know.

01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:59.489
You just gotta promise me that
my daughter's gonna be safe, okay?

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:01.763
You make me that promise.

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:03.525
You want the truth?

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:05.046
Please.

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:12.091
Give me all the names

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:15.885
of all the motherfuckers
they got working on the force.

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:17.411
Okay, okay...

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.000
- All right?
- Okay...

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:22.728
Okay. So, which phone do we start with?

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:24.371
It's in that one. That shitty one.

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:26.482
- That's the shitty one?
- Yes, sir!

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:44.120
How you feelin'?

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.365
Better.

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:53.642
Well, you should've shot him.

01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:03.961
I just tried to have sex with my hitman.

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:08.161
Nah. He's no assassin.

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:11.540
He just wanted to know what you know.

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:14.166
They're after us, not you.

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:20.401
Thank you.

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:36.887
You remind me
of someone very special to me.

01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:47.966
Get some rest.

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:52.240
Tomorrow they'll call Manuel Diaz
back to Mexico,

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:55.090
and we'll cut a leg from them.

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:31.647
Hello, sixty.

01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:45.605
We have eyes on the objective.
Can we get a closer visual?

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:52.806
Ten meters going by the eastern ridge.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.047
Papa?

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:33.005
- Football?
- SÃ­, Papa.

01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:52.687
No!

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:21.140
Come on in.

01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:22.446
Tasty beverage?

01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:25.927
Okay, boys.

01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:29.241
What's going on? What's the plan?

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:30.771
We're going hunting.

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:34.620
Looks like Manuel Diaz
is being called back to Mexico.

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:36.449
Just waiting for confirmation.

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:39.171
There's the tunnel right there.

01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:41.241
All right, listen up.

01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:43.485
Let's clarify the op.

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:45.780
We're gonna drive to location,
proceed on foot...

01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:47.564
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:49.683
- I'm fine.
- How's the neck?

01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:51.160
It's better, thank you.

01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:52.925
Good, good.

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:55.851
These diagrams are based on
other tunnels that have been mapped.

01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:57.724
They're for reference only,
they're not accurate.

01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:02.046
Once on the Mexican side of the border,
there'll be a small staging area,

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:04.260
then another shaft
will lead to the main warehouse

01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:06.044
and the road that returns to Mexico.

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:10.003
Once we clear the mules,
we don't expect more than a dozen bandits.

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:13.140
No, they use Mexican police
for vehicle transport.

01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:16.084
If you see a uniform in the tunnel,
consider him a bandit, too.

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:19.962
Okay. You want to discuss ROE?

01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:21.940
Nah, we'll save that for later.

01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:23.041
Okay.

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:26.850
This is an in and out.
We're clearing, placing an agent.

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:29.085
It's all about creating a diversion.

01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:31.460
Want the mother of all diversions, boys.

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:34.643
Need a lot of noise.
Fourth of July on steroids.

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:38.683
All right. Weapons check.
Let's go, boys.

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:45.049
This looks like confirmation.

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:56.620
- I need to fit your guy with a locator.
- Yeah, do it.

01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:58.940
Those are Special Ops.
Are we going in on this?

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:00.620
Nah. You guys aren't
really dressed for it.

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:01.780
You didn't fuckin' tell us.

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:03.820
Yeah, well, you two went
cryin' to Daddy yesterday, and we

01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:05.860
- don't want Daddy to know everything.
- Give me a fucking break!

01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:07.200
All right, we'll get you
some extra gear.

01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:08.660
We have tac gear in the car.

01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:11.220
All right. Good. You guys will hang back
when we get there, okay?

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:12.321
Then why are we going?

01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:15.180
'Cause CIA
can't operate within US borders

01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:17.601
without a domestic agency attached.

01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:22.685
I told you you'd be useful.

01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:25.363
So, that's it. That's why I'm here.

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:28.964
Yeah, that's it.

01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:31.051
That's why you're here.

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:34.971
Hey, we find any drugs,
you guys get to confiscate 'em.

01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:36.730
It's gonna be a big day.

01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:41.125
Un-fuckin' real!

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:50.380
Front and back.

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:54.500
Kate, come on. Fuck these people, man.
They've been using us from the beginning.

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:55.740
We don't have to do this.

01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:57.180
I need to know what they used us for.

01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:59.203
- Doesn't matter what!
- Yes, it does!

01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:03.761
I say we walk and make them
eat this whole fucked-up operation.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.161
No. I have to know.

01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:17.780
Black Mercedes... Plate number:
Romeo-India-November-

01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:22.090
three-one-Bravo-seven.
Heading south by southeast.

01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:35.921
Where?

01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:38.686
Okay.

01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:41.921
We gotta hit the tunnel
the minute we get on the ground.

01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:44.926
Pretty exciting, huh?

01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:59.165
What is the target's location?

01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:02.847
14 miles south of Nogales
heading west rapidly.

01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:16.889
Keep your fuckin' safeties on,
barrels pointed down.

01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:18.881
Stay in the back.

01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:22.530
Don't shoot anyone
on my fuckin' team. Right?

01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:56.925
Gear check?

01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:01.300
Thermal camera check.

01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:02.940
Night vision goggles check.

01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:04.580
Get those guys.

01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:06.091
Wanna take Alpha squad,
I'll take B squad?

01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:08.169
- You got it. Let's do it.
- Let's go, boys.

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:19.522
Control, do you copy?

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:22.044
Roger, Alpha. We read.

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:07.850
Fifty meters. Your three o'clock, Alpha.

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:26.440
Stand by. Getting close to objective.

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:38.646
Alpha, Bravo, be advised.
12 meters straight ahead.

01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:05.325
All right, we need to boogie and we need
to do it quiet till we find the center.

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:07.900
Draw the fighters to you
and make some noise.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.048
Don't follow me. I'll be fine.

01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:12.967
What are the rules of engagement?

01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:16.723
Weapons free, my friend. Weapons free.

01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:19.127
Weapons free, boys.

01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:20.921
Good luck.

01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:10.241
Oh, God!

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:37.251
- You okay?
- My gun!

01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:39.409
Leave it. Stay on my six.

01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:35.921
Freeze!

01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:39.500
Step away from him.

01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:40.740
Put that down.

01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:42.729
I mean it! Move away from him right now!

01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:51.922
Don't ever point a weapon at me again.

01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:55.521
Catch your breath.
Then get back up there.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.810
I am through. Do you have my location?

01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:34.608
Roger, we have you.
Target is east and north of you.

01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:39.529
Looks like Highway 56 to 17.
Will intercept him if he stays on 17.

01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:41.962
Go east on 56 off Highway 2.

01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:43.647
Wilco.

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:04.900
Is he through yet?

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:08.721
We have joy. GPS is transmitting.
Audio is transmitting.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.604
Should intercept in 20.

01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:14.850
That was a clean, clean fucking op,
my friend.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.684
Except for these two assholes.

01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:19.420
Well, you're better overseas.
You don't have to babysit.

01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:20.601
Where's Kate?

01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:22.520
I thought she was with you.

01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:24.921
We gotta go back.

01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:28.205
Shit. Boys, we're missin' one. Let's go.

01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:37.721
Hey!

01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:46.526
Just lay back, baby. Let it happen.

01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:53.451
Stop! Stop!

01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:55.540
Get off me!

01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:57.290
Stop moving! Stop!

01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:03.041
Stop it.

01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:06.441
Just relax. Just relax.

01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:10.780
All right? You gonna stay there?

01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:12.564
Are you gonna stay there?

01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:28.007
All right.

01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:31.246
Now, you listen.

01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:38.088
You went up the wrong tunnel.

01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:44.241
You saw things you shouldn't have seen.

01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:50.285
What is MedellÃ­n?

01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:52.481
MedellÃ­n?

01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:59.488
MedellÃ­n refers to a time

01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:04.283
when one group controlled
every aspect of the drug trade,

01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:08.725
providing a measure of order
that we could control.

01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:15.567
And until somebody finds a way
to convince 20% of the population

01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:18.121
to stop snorting and smoking that shit,

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:22.643
order's the best we can hope for.

01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:27.860
And what you saw up there,

01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:31.009
was Alejandro working toward
returning that order.

01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:37.647
Alejandro works for
the fucking Colombian Cartel.

01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:43.563
He works for the competition.

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:46.366
Alejandro works for anyone

01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:49.040
who will point him toward
the people who made him.

01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:53.580
Us.

01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:54.681
Them.

01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:58.003
Anyone who will turn him loose.

01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:04.568
So, he can get the person
that cut off his wife's head,

01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:09.051
and threw his daughter
into a vat of acid.

01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:14.201
Yeah.

01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:18.842
That's what we're dealing with.

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:25.089
You can't do this.

01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:28.806
You can't.

01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:35.100
I'm sure as shit not the person
you're gonna hide it all behind.

01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:36.440
You need to just take a breath.

01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:37.960
I'm gonna fuckin' talk.

01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:39.964
- No, you're not.
- Yeah.

01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:47.327
I'm gonna tell everyone what you did.

01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:54.489
That would be a major mistake.

01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:22.481
Is that the target up ahead? Confirm.

01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:28.845
Roger that.
Black Mercedes, 60 meters ahead.

01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:32.401
Silvio...

01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:53.491
This motherfucker...

01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:02.460
What happens when we get to the house?

01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:04.801
You'll stop the car, I'll get out.

01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:08.690
What will happen to me?

01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:11.441
Slow it down.

01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:04.921
Six remain.

01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:08.165
We're going blind.

01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:31.361
No.

01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:58.931
Every night you have families killed.

01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:03.604
And yet, here you dine.

01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:08.282
Tonight should be no different.

01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:39.001
Do you think the people
that sent you here

01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:40.681
are any different?

01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:46.681
Who do you think we learned it from?

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:54.365
The grieving lawyer...

01:45:57.120 --> 01:46:01.603
Your wife, you think she'd be proud
of what you've become?

01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:10.363
Don't forget about my daughter.

01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:44.651
Not in front of my boys.

01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:24.210
Go ahead and finish your meal.

01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:27.768
I would recommend not standing
on balconies for a while, Kate.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:00.126
Sit down.

01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:30.640
You look like a little girl
when you're scared.

01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:54.890
You remind me of the daughter
they took away from me.

01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:18.366
I need you to sign this piece of paper.

01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:23.764
It basically says that everything we did

01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:26.405
was done by the book.

01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:49.485
I can't sign that.

01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:53.001
Sign it.

01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:21.809
It's okay.

01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:25.810
I can't sign that.

01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:37.601
God!

01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:42.440
You would be committing suicide, Kate.

01:52:03.720 --> 01:52:05.722
Come on. Sign it.

01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:31.923
You should move to a small town,

01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:36.003
where the rule of law still exists.

01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:40.049
You will not survive here.

01:52:42.200 --> 01:52:43.690
You are not a wolf.

01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:46.409
And this is the land of wolves now.
