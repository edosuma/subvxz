WEBVTT

00:56.306 --> 01:00.226
I want to speak to you about
an account I read of Grace at the asylum.

01:02.353 --> 01:04.606
It paints her as a gibbering madwoman...

01:07.484 --> 01:08.818
shrieking like a phantom...

01:11.404 --> 01:13.490
and running around like a singed monkey.

01:13.573 --> 01:16.117
Have you developed your own theories
regarding her sanity?

01:16.201 --> 01:18.745
I have been proceeding
with the utmost caution.

01:18.828 --> 01:20.538
Have you asked her
what she remembers?

01:22.248 --> 01:25.418
She remembers her life
before arriving at Mr. Kinnear's

01:25.502 --> 01:29.923
with a vividness
and mass of circumstantial detail

01:30.006 --> 01:33.051
that indicates the problem is not
with her memory in general.

01:34.719 --> 01:37.639
Are you acquainted with a family
called Parkinson in Toronto?

01:37.722 --> 01:41.976
He died some years ago,
and the widow returned to her native land.

01:42.060 --> 01:45.480
She was an American like yourself.
She found the winters too cold.

01:45.563 --> 01:46.731
That is unfortunate.

01:46.815 --> 01:49.651
Grace's first situation
was with the Parkinsons.

01:49.734 --> 01:53.321
She had a friend, a fellow servant,
called Mary Whitney.

01:53.404 --> 01:56.533
You may recall this was the false name
she gave when escaping.

01:57.575 --> 02:00.036
In any case, this young woman died...

02:01.371 --> 02:03.540
under abrupt circumstances.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.335
When Grace was sitting
next to the body,

02:07.418 --> 02:09.462
she said she heard
her dead friend speak to her.

02:09.546 --> 02:10.588
Let me in!

02:10.672 --> 02:12.090
An auditory hallucination,
of course.

02:12.173 --> 02:13.925
It is not at all uncommon.

02:14.008 --> 02:16.594
I myself have attended
a great many death beds,

02:16.678 --> 02:19.264
and, especially among the sentimental...

02:20.098 --> 02:24.144
it is counted a mark of dishonor
not to have heard the deceased speak.

02:24.227 --> 02:28.815
If an angel choir is also audible,
so much the better.

02:28.898 --> 02:33.111
This hallucination was followed
by an episode of fainting and hysterics,

02:33.194 --> 02:36.573
mixed with what would appear
to have been somnambulism,

02:37.407 --> 02:41.411
after which there was a prolonged sleep
and subsequent amnesia.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.454
So she has a history of such lapses.

02:43.538 --> 02:45.081
Let's not jump to conclusions.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.625
She herself is at present
my only informant.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.419
It would be most useful

02:49.502 --> 02:52.839
to approach the time of the murders
with her now,

02:52.922 --> 02:55.508
given that she is speaking
about her amnesia.

02:55.592 --> 02:58.177
I must reiterate, my methods take time.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.431
It is most crucial not to rush it.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.525
I suppose
it's still the shock.

03:12.609 --> 03:15.236
So kind of you to make dinner again.

03:15.778 --> 03:19.449
You're so much more caring
than my husband ever was.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.262
♪ Rock of ages ♪

03:41.346 --> 03:43.723
♪ Cleft for me ♪

03:43.806 --> 03:47.727

04:16.381 --> 04:18.758
I did not know you could
sing so well, Grace.

04:20.885 --> 04:23.680
You have a... a beautiful voice.

04:24.305 --> 04:25.598
Thank you, sir.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.685
I used to have more occasion for it.

04:29.769 --> 04:33.064
Grace, I noticed that the guards
were quite rough with you.

04:33.856 --> 04:35.441
Does this happen often?

04:35.525 --> 04:36.651
Yes, sir.

04:37.777 --> 04:39.237
They prod and poke at me.

04:40.196 --> 04:42.865
They say filthy things
and I can't get free of them.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.077
That is unjust.

04:47.078 --> 04:48.913
I will speak to the governor about it.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.500
I wonder what has been causing
your loss of sleep.

04:53.376 --> 04:54.836
What makes you say that, Grace?

04:54.919 --> 04:57.839
You have dark circles under your eyes.
You haven't slept a wink.

04:57.922 --> 05:00.466
Well, I slept well.
Thank you for your concern.

05:03.761 --> 05:05.138
Oh, a parsnip.

05:05.805 --> 05:09.475
Not one I would have selected.
Has an orange tint, which means it's old.

05:09.559 --> 05:13.479
-Does it remind you of anything?
-There's "Fine words butter no parsnips."

05:14.647 --> 05:17.108
-It's also very hard to peel.
-They're kept in cellars.

05:20.278 --> 05:23.281
Oh, no, sir.
Outside in a hole in the ground.

05:23.364 --> 05:26.034
They are much improved
by being frozen.

05:31.247 --> 05:32.874
Shall I continue where we left off?

05:34.042 --> 05:35.793
I've forgotten just where that was, sir.

05:35.877 --> 05:38.713
The death of Mary,
your poor friend Mary Whitney.

05:40.506 --> 05:42.425
Ah, yes. Mary.

05:48.222 --> 05:50.016
She was buried in my best nightdress.

05:51.350 --> 05:55.146
And she didn't look dead in the least,
but only very pale.

05:56.397 --> 06:00.401
And all laid out in white like that,
she looked just like a bride.

06:08.117 --> 06:09.494
In sure and certain hope

06:09.577 --> 06:12.580
of the resurrection to eternal life
through our Lord Jesus Christ,

06:12.663 --> 06:15.708
we commend to almighty God
our sister Mary

06:16.292 --> 06:18.419
and we commit her body to the ground.

06:18.503 --> 06:23.091
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.

06:23.174 --> 06:27.011
The Lord lift up his countenance
upon her and give her peace.

06:27.095 --> 06:28.471
-Amen.
-Amen.

06:28.554 --> 06:30.973
She was put with the Methodists
on Adelaide Street,

06:31.057 --> 06:33.434
off in the corner
right next to the paupers,

06:33.518 --> 06:38.272
but still within the churchyard, so I felt
I had done all for her that I could.

06:38.356 --> 06:42.777
I saw death in Mary's eyes,
but then hindsight is always accurate.

06:43.653 --> 06:44.987
I will pray for her.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.231
It was hard for me to believe
that Mary was truly dead.

07:26.988 --> 07:29.615
Grace, come. Have a seat.

07:30.783 --> 07:32.160
Come, come.

07:37.915 --> 07:38.958
Grace...

07:41.669 --> 07:44.755
-Do you know the man?
-Ma'am?

07:45.798 --> 07:46.924
The man...

07:48.468 --> 07:49.552
Mary.

07:51.637 --> 07:52.805
I do not.

07:54.515 --> 07:57.602
I'm going to ask you
to swear on the Bible

07:58.436 --> 08:02.773
that, even if you do know,
you will never divulge it.

08:04.275 --> 08:07.403
And if you can swear that,
on the Bible,

08:08.738 --> 08:12.074
I will make sure that your wages
are increased immediately...

08:13.201 --> 08:16.120
and that if you should choose
to leave the house,

08:17.163 --> 08:20.458
I will give you a good reference
for future employment.

08:30.343 --> 08:33.763
I never had fault to find
with your work, Grace.

08:43.898 --> 08:46.150
Mr. George Parkinson
did not seem in any hurry

08:46.234 --> 08:48.611
to get back to the United States
and his education.

08:55.993 --> 08:56.994
Excuse me, Mother.

09:06.170 --> 09:07.672
- Grace.

09:18.516 --> 09:22.311
So sorry about your friend, Mary.
I know you were very dear to her.

09:27.775 --> 09:28.776
George.

09:35.992 --> 09:38.869
Grace, please be more careful.

09:52.508 --> 09:54.760
Grace, open the door.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.722
Grace, it's George. Let me in.

10:00.308 --> 10:02.018
Grace, let me in.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.152
Open the door.

10:12.194 --> 10:15.531
Lock or no lock, sooner or later,
he'd find a way of getting in.

10:16.991 --> 10:20.870
Once you're found with a man, you are
the guilty one, no matter how they get in.

10:21.954 --> 10:26.584
As Mary used to say, some masters think
you owe them service 24 hours a day

10:26.667 --> 10:29.295
and should do the main work
flat on your back.

10:32.298 --> 10:35.051
As I've said, sir, she had
a very forward way of speaking.

10:49.148 --> 10:52.526
Oh, Nancy, this is Grace.
Nancy's an old friend.

10:52.610 --> 10:55.571
-She's visiting from Richmond Hill.
-Lovely to meet you, Grace.

10:56.530 --> 10:57.698
I must be going.

10:57.782 --> 11:01.243
I need to get to the dry goods auction
before Clarkson's store closes.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.705
Will you look at the pretty muslin
I got last time.

11:04.789 --> 11:07.667
Now, what would a housekeeper be wanting
with a dress like that, Nancy?

11:07.750 --> 11:09.794
You always had such fine tastes.

11:09.877 --> 11:11.796
Do you have a long road to Richmond Hill?

11:11.879 --> 11:15.508
No, I did not take the coach into town.
My master drove me in.

11:15.591 --> 11:17.510
Do you know where Richmond Hill is?

11:17.593 --> 11:19.595
Up Yonge Street past Hogg's Hollow?

11:20.221 --> 11:23.140
I'm in want of another servant
to help me with the work.

11:23.224 --> 11:27.812
Mr. Kinnear, my master, is a gentleman
of a fine Scottish family.

11:27.895 --> 11:31.440
He's not married, so there's no mistress
of the household to carp and criticize.

11:31.899 --> 11:33.609
Would you be interested in the position?

11:33.692 --> 11:37.613
I'm lonely for female company
and I don't like being

11:37.696 --> 11:41.117
a single woman alone with a gentleman,
as people will talk.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.743
Oh, I'm not sure.

11:43.661 --> 11:48.082
Mr. Kinnear is a liberal master
and he shows it when he's pleased.

11:48.165 --> 11:50.960
You'll be making a good bargain
and stepping up in the world.

11:51.043 --> 11:52.753
What are your wages at present?

11:53.462 --> 11:56.799
-Two dollars a month.
-I will pay you three dollars a month.

11:59.718 --> 12:01.053
Well, that is more than fair.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.013
Wonderful.

12:03.764 --> 12:07.768
Here's some money for you to take
the coach to Richmond Hill tomorrow.

12:07.852 --> 12:10.688
- I myself will meet you by the inn.
- Grace.

12:11.856 --> 12:14.191
I'm sorry to steal your best help, Sally.

12:14.900 --> 12:18.028
You just said such glowing things
about my new girl.

12:18.112 --> 12:21.031
Little did I know you'd be
taking her from us.

12:25.453 --> 12:28.706
I'm not sure it is a suitable position
for a young girl like you.

12:28.789 --> 12:29.999
Why not?

12:31.208 --> 12:34.086
Nancy has always been kind to me
and I don't like to talk.

12:34.170 --> 12:38.340
A person has to take her own chances
and the least said, the soonest mended.

12:38.424 --> 12:41.552
I don't know anything for certain
so it would not be right to say more.

12:42.219 --> 12:45.764
But I do feel I have done my duty
in saying as much as I have

12:45.848 --> 12:48.392
because you have
no mother to advise you.

12:50.895 --> 12:53.272
I didn't have the least idea
what she was talking about.

12:53.355 --> 12:55.357
Have you heard any harm spoken
of Mr. Kinnear?

12:56.817 --> 12:58.652
Nothing the world at large
would call harm.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.907
It was like a puzzle I could not guess

13:02.990 --> 13:06.452
and it would have been better for all
if she had spoken more plainly.

13:07.119 --> 13:10.498
But the pay was higher than anything I'd
had before, which weighed heavily on me,

13:11.373 --> 13:13.792
along with my need to get away
from Mr. George Parkinson.

13:13.876 --> 13:18.547
And what weighed even more heavily
on me was Nancy Montgomery herself.

13:21.884 --> 13:24.970
She resembled Mary Whitney,
or so I then thought.

13:25.054 --> 13:27.640
And I'd been depressed in spirits
ever since Mary's death.

13:28.557 --> 13:30.476
And so I decided to go.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.001
The journey up Yonge Street
to Richmond Hill

13:56.085 --> 13:58.295
was more uncomfortable than I expected.

14:00.422 --> 14:03.175
-Never look behind you.
-Why not?

14:03.259 --> 14:05.469
Because the past is the past
and regret is vain.

14:05.553 --> 14:09.265
Let bygones be bygones.
You know what became of Lot's wife.

14:09.348 --> 14:12.893
Turned to a pillar of salt.
A waste of a good woman.

14:15.104 --> 14:18.065
Not that they aren't all the better
for a pinch of salt.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.734
See that there? Montgomery's Tavern.

14:20.818 --> 14:23.737
That's where Mackenzie and his band
of ragtags held their seditious meetings

14:23.821 --> 14:26.615
and set out to march down Yonge Street
during the rebellion.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.368
William Lyon Mackenzie?

14:29.451 --> 14:32.955
One of them was shot in front of it,
trying to warn the government troops.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.748
They burnt it down afterwards.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.709
Some traitors were hung, but not enough.

14:36.792 --> 14:40.337
That cowardly rascal Mackenzie should be
dragged back from the States.

14:40.421 --> 14:43.966
He ran off, leaving his friends to swing
at the rope's end for him.

14:44.049 --> 14:47.845
I could tell by the smell of his breath
it was just as well not to provoke him.

14:47.928 --> 14:49.305
And so I said nothing.

14:49.889 --> 14:54.518
William Lyon Mackenzie was a hero to Mary.
It was hard to say nothing.

15:00.524 --> 15:03.777
-Where are you staying?
-What you don't know won't hurt you.

15:04.403 --> 15:07.781
Why don't you come in
for a glass of whisky for old times' sake?

15:08.741 --> 15:11.327
-Would your name be Grace Marks?
-Yes.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.412
-Is this man a friend of yours?
-No.

15:13.495 --> 15:18.417
-The lady does not desire your company.
-She is no lady, she's a whore.

15:22.546 --> 15:27.343
I am Thomas Kinnear, your new employer.
I've come to fetch you.

15:29.803 --> 15:31.513
You've not been in town five minutes

15:31.597 --> 15:34.433
and you've managed
to attract gentlemen admirers.

15:34.516 --> 15:38.395
-They are not.
-Not gentlemen or not admirers?

15:38.938 --> 15:40.689
This is Charley.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.650
So, up you go, Grace.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.028
Do you mean me to sit in front?

15:46.111 --> 15:49.615
We can hardly have you riding in the back
like a piece of luggage.

15:54.703 --> 15:57.373
I was not used to sitting beside
a gentleman like him,

15:57.456 --> 16:00.000
but he didn't seem to give it
a second thought.

16:00.084 --> 16:02.252
And there we were,
driving up Yonge Street,

16:02.336 --> 16:04.254
just as if I was a fine lady.

16:04.338 --> 16:05.965
What did Mr. Kinnear look like?

16:07.800 --> 16:10.010
He had a gentlemanly bearing, sir.

16:11.261 --> 16:14.932
Is that all?
You did not observe him very particularly.

16:15.724 --> 16:18.102
I did not wish to gape at him, sir,

16:18.185 --> 16:20.813
and I needed to turn my head
because of my bonnet.

16:21.689 --> 16:23.899
I suppose you've never worn a bonnet, sir.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.651
No, I have not.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.737
I expect it is confining.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.365
It is that, sir.

17:11.530 --> 17:14.283
Hello, Jamie. This is Grace Marks.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.702
Come from Toronto.
I found her at the inn.

17:17.953 --> 17:22.332
Jamie lives nearby and helps us
around the farm from time to time.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.505
Hello.

17:29.256 --> 17:33.552
Is it big, Toronto? Is it very grand?
I've never been there.

17:33.635 --> 17:34.720
Grand enough.

17:34.803 --> 17:37.639
I could not find it in me to answer
properly about Toronto,

17:37.723 --> 17:40.559
because right then I was bitterly sorry
I'd ever left it.

17:41.435 --> 17:45.022
I heard her laughing.
She had not given me one word of greeting.

17:45.105 --> 17:48.776
McDermott. Take Grace's things
to her room.

17:57.367 --> 17:59.328
Something squeezed tight about my heart.

18:13.842 --> 18:15.427
When I close my eyes...

18:21.058 --> 18:24.603
I can remember every detail of that house
as clear as a picture.

18:27.815 --> 18:30.400
I could walk through every room of it
blindfolded.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.409
Strange to reflect...

18:41.453 --> 18:43.747
that, of all the people
living in that house,

18:45.457 --> 18:48.293
I was the only one of them left alive
in six months' time.

19:09.148 --> 19:14.069
Though at that moment I had no feeling
about it and only wanted a drink of water.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.785
Eventually Nancy gave me
a proper tour of the house.

19:24.496 --> 19:27.207
There's no separate laundry room,
but the things for washing,

19:27.291 --> 19:29.209
the coppers, the washtub
and the scrubbing board,

19:29.293 --> 19:31.086
are present in the summer kitchen.

19:31.170 --> 19:34.006
We don't keep a pig.
They're too clever for their own good.

19:34.464 --> 19:36.925
Mr. Kinnear's old dog Fancy died.

19:37.009 --> 19:40.220
I'd feel easier with a dog about the place
to bark at strangers.

19:40.971 --> 19:44.016
There's a trap door under here
to the cellar.

19:45.058 --> 19:46.643
I thought it was an odd place

19:46.727 --> 19:48.770
as the kitchen would have been
more convenient,

19:48.854 --> 19:50.898
but the kitchen
didn't have a cellar under it.

19:52.107 --> 19:53.650
Go on, Grace.

19:53.734 --> 19:54.651
Of course.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.362
The cellar stairs were
too steep for comfort,

19:57.446 --> 20:00.657
and the cellar was divided
into two parts by a half-wall,

20:00.741 --> 20:03.785
the dairy on one side,
where they kept the butter and cheeses,

20:03.869 --> 20:07.080
and on the other side, the place
where they stored the wine and the beer

20:07.164 --> 20:09.249
and apples and the cabbages
and beets and potatoes--

20:09.333 --> 20:11.793
-Yes, Grace, but...
-Yes, sir?

20:11.877 --> 20:13.754
I understand what is stored in a cellar.

20:15.130 --> 20:16.298
Of course.

20:16.381 --> 20:19.676
There's a window down there, but you
should always take a candle or a lantern.

20:19.760 --> 20:23.347
It's dark below and you could trip and
fall down the stairs and break your neck.

20:25.766 --> 20:28.435
We did not go down into the cellar
at that time.

20:31.271 --> 20:33.982
Nancy, who was now all smiles,
showed me to my room.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.193
She had on a very handsome pair
of earrings,

20:36.276 --> 20:40.364
which I could tell were real gold,
and I wondered how she could afford them

20:40.447 --> 20:41.990
on the salary of a housekeeper.

20:45.369 --> 20:48.372
I could see there was no love lost
between McDermott and Nancy.

20:52.584 --> 20:54.294
He's more surly than ever.

20:55.003 --> 20:56.755
He can suit himself and welcome.

20:56.838 --> 21:01.343
It's a smile or the open road for him,
or more likely the bottom of a ditch.

21:09.977 --> 21:12.354
I am very glad to see you, Grace.

21:12.437 --> 21:14.982
You must be very tired after your journey,
it's very fatiguing.

21:15.065 --> 21:17.526
Why don't you rest
and start work in the morning?

21:38.839 --> 21:40.549
I liked being early to rise.

21:41.341 --> 21:45.387
That way, I could pretend for a little
while that the house was all my own.

22:04.531 --> 22:06.450
Mind your manners or I'll wring your neck.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.161
Would that be me you're addressing?

22:10.662 --> 22:12.331
No, it would not.

22:12.414 --> 22:15.792
I could tell what he had in mind,
and it was not original.

22:42.152 --> 22:45.072
I did think it unusual for a housekeeper
to be learning the piano.

22:45.864 --> 22:47.324
But of course I said nothing.

22:47.407 --> 22:50.243
And then everything went on very quietly
for a fortnight.

22:53.080 --> 22:57.375
-Yes, sir. More or less quietly.
-What is "everything"? How did it go on?

22:57.876 --> 23:00.253
-I beg your pardon, sir?
-What did you do every day?

23:00.337 --> 23:01.880
The usual, sir. I performed my duties.

23:01.963 --> 23:04.883
You will forgive me.
Of what did those duties consist?

23:06.259 --> 23:07.803
You were not making a joke.

23:10.514 --> 23:11.890
You really don't know.

23:11.973 --> 23:15.310
Men such as yourself do not have
to clean up the messes you make,

23:15.393 --> 23:18.688
but we have to clean up our own messes
and yours into the bargain.

23:19.815 --> 23:21.733
In that way, you are like children.

23:21.817 --> 23:25.737
You do not have to think ahead or worry
about the consequences of what you do.

23:26.446 --> 23:30.492
But it is not your fault.
It is only how you are brought up.

24:32.679 --> 24:34.055
And then?

24:39.477 --> 24:41.897
Then I collected the slop pails
and rinsed them out.

24:50.405 --> 24:53.533
With a pump, you have to pour some in
before you get any out.

24:53.617 --> 24:56.661
Mary Whitney said that was how men
viewed the flattering of a woman

24:56.745 --> 24:58.371
when they had low ends in view.

25:00.916 --> 25:03.877
Mary Whitney was not proper,
but she was honest.

25:03.960 --> 25:06.671
So that's how you rinse out a slop pail.

25:09.174 --> 25:11.801
Well, of course I went to the privy first
to empty it.

25:11.885 --> 25:15.138
I went to the privy and emptied
the slop pail, and so forth.

25:15.222 --> 25:16.556
And so forth?

25:18.225 --> 25:19.476
"Really, Doctor," I thought,

25:20.310 --> 25:24.147
"if you didn't know what you do in
a privy, there really is no hope for you.

25:35.158 --> 25:39.079
What I did was, I hoisted my skirts
and sat down above the buzzing flies,

25:39.162 --> 25:43.750
on the same seat everyone in the house
sat on, lady or lady's maid.

25:44.668 --> 25:48.463
They both piss and it smells the same,
and not like lilacs neither,

25:48.546 --> 25:50.632
as Mary Whitney used to say.

25:51.716 --> 25:55.470
Some of the pictures were of duchesses
from England and high-society ladies

25:55.553 --> 25:57.180
in New York and the like.

25:59.182 --> 26:02.519
Never let your picture be in a magazine
or newspaper if you can help it,

26:02.602 --> 26:04.271
as you never know what ends

26:04.354 --> 26:08.650
your face may be made to serve by others
once it has got out of your control."

26:10.485 --> 26:12.988
But I did not say any of this to you,
Dr. Jordan.

26:13.071 --> 26:14.864
And so forth.

26:18.493 --> 26:21.663
"And so forth" is all you are entitled to,
I thought.

26:21.746 --> 26:24.082
Just because you pestered me
to know everything

26:24.165 --> 26:26.001
was no reason for me to tell you.

26:41.850 --> 26:43.059
Good morning.

26:43.143 --> 26:45.562
-Good morning.
-Is the tea made?

26:45.645 --> 26:46.688
Yes.

26:47.314 --> 26:50.483
I'm scarcely alive in the morning
until I've had my cup of tea.

26:51.192 --> 26:53.653
Mr. Kinnear will take his upstairs.

26:53.737 --> 26:55.822
He'll want a second cup
when he comes down.

26:56.656 --> 26:58.241
I will take it up.

26:58.992 --> 27:01.828
At Mrs. Parkinson's, the housekeeper
would never carry the...

27:04.831 --> 27:07.208
It was beneath her position
and a job for the maids.

27:07.917 --> 27:10.545
Of course.
I only took it up when short of help.

27:10.628 --> 27:13.548
I've got into the habit of it lately.
Go ahead.

27:20.555 --> 27:21.723
Your tea, sir.

27:22.807 --> 27:24.893
Yes. Bring it in.

27:36.905 --> 27:38.156
Thank you, Grace.

27:38.239 --> 27:41.951
There's beautiful eggs this morning, sir.
Would you want one for your breakfast?

27:42.619 --> 27:45.246
Yes. Thank you, Grace.
I'm sure it will do me good.

27:55.924 --> 27:58.134
Mr. Kinnear wants an egg
for his breakfast.

27:58.676 --> 28:00.428
I will have one also.

28:00.512 --> 28:03.932
He will have his fried, with bacon,
and mine should be boiled.

28:04.766 --> 28:07.143
We will have breakfast together
in the dining room.

28:08.019 --> 28:10.313
He requires me to keep him company.

28:12.023 --> 28:13.650
He does not like to eat alone.

28:15.402 --> 28:19.489
-Is Mr. Kinnear ill at all?
-No. He just likes to be fussed over.

28:22.242 --> 28:25.703
I wonder why he never married,
a fine man like him.

28:26.871 --> 28:30.250
Some gentlemen do not have
an inclination for the married state.

28:30.333 --> 28:34.087
They are very pleased with themselves
and think they can get along without it.

28:34.754 --> 28:37.841
-I suppose they can at that.
-Certainly they can, if rich enough.

28:37.924 --> 28:41.761
If they want a thing, they pay for it.
It's all one to them.

29:07.328 --> 29:11.124
-His nightshirt needs to be aired out.
-Yes, I was just about to.

29:12.083 --> 29:14.794
And his dressing things
are not to be laid out like this.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.088
This is how he likes them.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.258
And you'll need to polish
the silver backs every week.

29:20.341 --> 29:22.635
At Mrs. Parkinson's
we did it every three days.

29:22.719 --> 29:24.971
I don't care, as you are not
at Mrs. Parkinson's.

29:34.397 --> 29:36.858
His folded shirts ready for wearing
go on this shelf.

29:41.279 --> 29:43.364
What is this picture of?

29:43.448 --> 29:46.785
It's Susannah and the Elders,
which is a Bible subject.

29:47.494 --> 29:50.455
I know my Bible backwards
and forwards and this is not in it.

29:51.289 --> 29:53.291
-Yes, it is.
-It is not.

29:54.375 --> 29:58.213
You're not here to argue about paintings
but to clean the room.

29:59.964 --> 30:03.843
Are you two discussing theology,
and so early in the morning too?

30:03.927 --> 30:05.386
It is nothing to be bothered by.

30:05.470 --> 30:07.305
I should like to know
what you were discussing.

30:07.388 --> 30:08.723
It does not matter.

30:09.224 --> 30:12.977
Well, Grace, I can see Nancy wishes
to keep it a secret from me,

30:13.061 --> 30:14.854
but you must tell me.

30:16.314 --> 30:17.607
I...

30:18.650 --> 30:22.946
I was wondering if this picture is
of a biblical subject as Nancy says.

30:23.029 --> 30:26.241
No. No. Strictly speaking it is not.

30:26.908 --> 30:29.744
-The story is in the Apocrypha.
-What might that be?

30:30.912 --> 30:33.248
You are very curious
for such a young person.

30:33.957 --> 30:37.252
Soon I will have the most learned
maidservant in all Richmond Hill.

30:37.335 --> 30:41.381
I'll have to put on a display,
like the mathematical pig in Toronto.

30:43.800 --> 30:47.512
The Apocrypha is a book where they put
all the stories from biblical times

30:47.595 --> 30:49.639
they decided should not go in the Bible.

30:49.722 --> 30:52.725
Who decided?
I thought the Bible was written by God.

30:52.809 --> 30:55.436
It's called "the word of God"
and everyone terms it so.

30:55.520 --> 30:59.399
Perhaps God wrote it, but men wrote it
down, which is a little different.

30:59.482 --> 31:02.110
But those men were said to have been
inspired by God,

31:02.193 --> 31:05.113
which means He spoke to them,
told them what to do.

31:06.155 --> 31:07.323
Did they hear voices?

31:07.407 --> 31:08.575
Aye.

31:09.617 --> 31:12.120
I was glad to hear that someone else
heard voices too,

31:12.829 --> 31:14.122
though I didn't say that.

31:14.956 --> 31:18.877
In any case, the voice I had heard
that one time had not been God's,

31:20.003 --> 31:21.462
but Mary Whitney's.

31:24.173 --> 31:27.218
-Do you know the story of Susannah?
-No.

31:28.928 --> 31:33.433
She was a young lady who was falsely
accused of sinning with a young man,

31:33.516 --> 31:37.270
by a group of old men, because she refused
to commit the very same sin with them.

31:38.104 --> 31:41.190
She would have been stoned to death,
but luckily she had a very clever lawyer

31:41.274 --> 31:44.235
and he was able to prove
that the old men were lying

31:44.319 --> 31:46.905
by inducing them to give
contradictory evidence.

31:49.324 --> 31:50.909
What do you think the moral is?

31:50.992 --> 31:54.162
That you should not take baths outside
in the garden.

31:56.497 --> 32:00.209
I think the moral is
you need a clever lawyer.

32:00.293 --> 32:02.587
This girl is no simpleton after all.

32:02.670 --> 32:06.925
Ooh, I found a shirt cleaned
and put away with a button missing.

32:07.008 --> 32:09.469
It's very aggravating
to put on a clean shirt,

32:09.552 --> 32:12.972
only to discover you cannot do it up
properly because of a lack of buttons.

32:15.266 --> 32:17.101
Please mind that does not happen again.

32:37.914 --> 32:40.166
You did not clean my shoes
properly this morning.

32:40.249 --> 32:41.417
Watch yourself.

32:57.433 --> 32:59.394
Grace. You look tired.

32:59.477 --> 33:01.854
Sit down with me and have a cup of tea.

33:01.938 --> 33:03.815
I cannot risk waiting on laundry.

33:03.898 --> 33:06.442
This time of year, there could be
a quick change in weather.

33:06.526 --> 33:07.902
All right.

33:07.986 --> 33:11.531
When you have it all hung up,
let's have a cup of tea then.

33:25.628 --> 33:27.505
There is a great pleasure
to be had

33:27.588 --> 33:29.799
in a wash all clean and blowing
in the wind.

33:29.882 --> 33:33.136
The sound is like the hands
of the Heavenly Hosts applauding,

33:33.219 --> 33:34.679
though heard from far away.

33:35.471 --> 33:38.558
And they do say that cleanliness
is next to Godliness.

33:39.225 --> 33:43.438
And sometimes, when I have seen the pure
white clouds billowing in the sky

33:43.521 --> 33:46.441
after a rain, I used to think
the angels themselves

33:46.524 --> 33:48.067
were hanging out their washing,

33:49.193 --> 33:51.195
for I reasoned that someone must do it,

33:51.279 --> 33:55.158
as everything in Heaven
must be very clean and fresh.

33:58.411 --> 34:03.166
But these were childish fancies, as
children like to tell themselves stories

34:03.249 --> 34:04.834
about things that are not visible.

34:06.753 --> 34:09.380
And I was scarcely more than a child
at the time...

34:11.215 --> 34:14.010
though I thought of myself
as a grown woman.

34:21.559 --> 34:23.644
Excuse me. Excuse me, Grace.

34:23.728 --> 34:26.314
-Yes, hello, Jamie.
-Are there any errands to be run?

34:26.981 --> 34:28.691
I'll have to ask Nancy.

34:28.775 --> 34:32.945
If I'm sent into the village and there's
anything you want, I'd fetch it for you.

34:33.029 --> 34:34.322
Thank you, Jamie.

34:34.989 --> 34:37.617
Jamie. Come inside
and I'll tell you what we need.

34:37.700 --> 34:40.244
And you must come back later
and bring your flute.

34:40.328 --> 34:42.997
He plays so beautifully,
it's a pleasure to hear.

35:29.335 --> 35:31.045
Do you enjoy dancing?

35:32.797 --> 35:33.881
Why do you ask?

35:34.715 --> 35:36.843
I saw you dancing.
You are a good dancer.

35:38.803 --> 35:41.055
Maybe I am and maybe I'm not.

35:41.722 --> 35:44.142
Tell me about your life
before you came to work here.

35:44.225 --> 35:45.726
-Who would care about that?
-I would.

35:45.810 --> 35:47.687
All such stories are of interest to me.

35:50.940 --> 35:55.653
Me myself I've always been a scapegrace.
Never one to lick the boots of the rich.

35:55.736 --> 36:00.741
-Do you have a mother living?
-Whether I do or don't, it's all the same.

36:01.659 --> 36:04.745
She had a bad opinion of me,
told me I was going to the Devil.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.039
She could be dead for all I care.

36:08.583 --> 36:11.586
Deserted the army and stowed away
on a ship bound for America.

36:13.546 --> 36:18.050
When I got to this country, I enlisted as
a soldier in the Glengarry Light Infantry.

36:18.134 --> 36:23.055
Didn't they have a bad reputation?
My friend told me.

36:23.764 --> 36:25.558
Didn't they burn down farmhouses
during the rebellion,

36:25.641 --> 36:27.435
turn women and children out into the snow?

36:27.518 --> 36:30.021
Yeah, and they've done far worse besides.

36:30.897 --> 36:32.899
Some things they don't print
in the papers.

36:34.567 --> 36:37.236
Then the rebellion ended
and the regiment was disbanded

36:37.320 --> 36:39.155
and I heard about this position.

36:40.323 --> 36:43.743
I thought I would be working
for the gentleman himself, but not so.

36:43.826 --> 36:45.578
A woman is set over me instead.

36:46.662 --> 36:49.790
One who never gives me a moment's rest
from her tongue.

36:53.794 --> 36:55.129
Do you have a sweetheart?

36:56.297 --> 36:58.841
A pretty girl like you
might be expected to have one.

36:58.925 --> 37:02.386
I do not, and I do not have
any inclinations that way.

37:02.470 --> 37:05.514
That is a pity, but there's a first time
for everything.

37:06.349 --> 37:09.644
You need breaking in like a colt
and you'll go as good as the rest.

37:10.144 --> 37:11.938
I'm the man for the job.

37:12.021 --> 37:14.899
I'll thank you to keep such
offensive remarks to yourself.

37:14.982 --> 37:16.150
I am not a mare.

37:17.109 --> 37:18.527
I didn't mean it.

37:19.737 --> 37:24.700
It's all in fun; just wanted to see
what sort of girl you might be.

37:24.784 --> 37:27.036
What sort I'd be is no business of yours.

37:47.598 --> 37:49.016
Remain where you are.

37:49.558 --> 37:52.478
I would rather have good butter
than a curtsy.

37:53.688 --> 37:55.773
Always busy I see, Grace.

37:56.524 --> 37:59.944
Yes, sir.
The Devil finds work for idle hands to do.

38:02.071 --> 38:04.991
I trust you do not mean me.
My hands are idle enough,

38:05.074 --> 38:07.034
but not nearly devilish enough
for my liking.

38:07.118 --> 38:09.495
Oh, no, sir, I did not mean you.

38:10.413 --> 38:12.581
It's very becoming
for a young woman to blush.

38:17.169 --> 38:19.005
How is the butter
coming along, Grace?

38:19.088 --> 38:21.924
-Where is Mr. Kinnear going?
-To Colonel Bridgeford's.

38:23.301 --> 38:27.763
His wife is away so he can visit safely.
When she's home, he's not well received.

38:27.847 --> 38:31.100
-Why not?
-She considers him a bad influence.

38:32.601 --> 38:35.771
- Why? What has he done?
- Well, he was packed off to the colonies

38:35.855 --> 38:38.482
-to get him out of the way.
-Why?

38:39.233 --> 38:42.987
The usual reasons, I suspect.
Debt or women.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.782
There. The butter's coming.

39:04.967 --> 39:06.427
I don't like it down here.

39:07.303 --> 39:10.848
It always smells of earth
and mice and old vegetables.

39:10.931 --> 39:12.558
I suppose most cellars do.

39:13.893 --> 39:16.228
Perhaps it could be given
a good airing out someday.

39:36.791 --> 39:38.459
What on earth is he doing?

39:39.460 --> 39:41.170
He just does that sometimes.

39:41.253 --> 39:44.840
He says it's for exercise,
but he just wants to be admired.

39:44.924 --> 39:46.425
You should not pay any attention.

39:48.302 --> 39:51.680
So there I was pretending
not to watch, and there he was,

39:51.764 --> 39:54.558
pretending not to be watched,
as women and men often do,

39:55.434 --> 39:59.105
and he was the sort of man you knew you
shouldn't look at, but you looked anyway.

40:00.523 --> 40:04.568
Jamie! You brought your flute!
Grace, fetch Jamie a mug of beer.

40:14.703 --> 40:15.996
I'll have one too.

40:16.080 --> 40:18.874
I didn't know you had monkey blood.
You was leaping like one.

40:18.958 --> 40:22.586
When the cat's away, the mice do play.
Nancy always likes her little parties.

40:22.670 --> 40:25.423
I'm sure the Walsh boy will be screeching
his tin whistle soon.

40:25.506 --> 40:28.426
That is right, and I will give myself
the pleasure of hearing it.

40:28.509 --> 40:31.804
-To my mind, that's no pleasure.
-You can suit yourself then.

40:33.889 --> 40:35.516
I didn't mean to offend you before.

40:36.684 --> 40:40.062
I've been so long around rough men
whose manners are not the best.

40:40.938 --> 40:42.440
I'm inclined to forget myself.

40:43.357 --> 40:44.817
I don't know how to speak.

40:47.403 --> 40:49.280
Forgive me and we can be friends.

40:50.573 --> 40:53.367
Is forgiveness not ordained in the Bible?

41:06.046 --> 41:08.549
And there we were, in a kind of harmony.

41:08.632 --> 41:11.635
And the evening was so beautiful,
it made a pain in my heart,

41:12.261 --> 41:14.430
as when you cannot tell
whether you're happy or sad.

41:16.807 --> 41:21.187
And I thought that if I could have a wish,
it would be that nothing would ever change

41:21.270 --> 41:22.980
and we would stay that way forever.

41:30.696 --> 41:34.074
But the sun cannot be stopped in its path,
except by God,

41:34.742 --> 41:36.702
and he has done that only once

41:36.785 --> 41:39.955
and will not do it again until the end
of the world.

41:53.844 --> 41:57.640
I thought, if I could have two fireflies
on my ears for earrings...

41:57.723 --> 42:00.643
I should be going home.
My father will be looking for me.

42:00.726 --> 42:02.478
...I would not care
about Nancy's gold ones.

42:02.561 --> 42:05.022
Grace, make sure you lock
all the doors and windows.

42:05.105 --> 42:07.316
And will you sleep with me tonight?

42:07.399 --> 42:09.235
I'm afraid when Kinnear is not home.
