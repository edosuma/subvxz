<i>Maybe for you
there's a tomorrow.</i>

01:18.246 --> 01:23.246
<i>Maybe for you
there's 1,000 or 3,000</i>

01:25.462 --> 01:26.672
<i>or 10.</i>

01:39.476 --> 01:41.846
<i>So much time
you can bathe in it.</i>

01:48.318 --> 01:50.148
<i>So much time
you can waste it.</i>

01:56.785 --> 01:58.655
<i>But for some of us,</i>

01:59.662 --> 02:02.082
<i>there's only today.</i>

02:02.165 --> 02:04.165
<i>And what you do
today matters.</i>

02:05.627 --> 02:09.457
<i>In the moment,
and maybe into infinity.</i>

02:16.930 --> 02:20.980
<i>But I didn't know any of that
until right before I fell.</i>

02:26.064 --> 02:28.784
<i>The thing is,
you don't get to know.</i>

02:29.609 --> 02:31.819
<i>You don't wake up with a bad
feeling in your stomach</i>

02:31.903 --> 02:33.403
<i>or see shadows move.</i>

02:34.405 --> 02:39.115
<i>If you're like me, you wake
up 24 minutes and 47 seconds</i>

02:39.202 --> 02:42.082
<i>before your best friend is
supposed to be picking you up.</i>

02:43.665 --> 02:44.665
<i>If you're like me,</i>

02:45.959 --> 02:47.539
<i>your last day
starts like this.</i>

03:36.718 --> 03:38.508
Well,
I'll let you know by noon.

03:39.512 --> 03:41.512
Well, I can't organize
a playdate before...

03:41.598 --> 03:43.268
You want something to eat?
No. I'm good.

03:44.350 --> 03:46.100
Sammy, you like
the bird I made you?

03:47.437 --> 03:48.647
Morning.

03:51.608 --> 03:52.648
Sammy!
What?

03:52.775 --> 03:54.145
You forgot
your gloves!

03:54.402 --> 03:56.282
Izzy, how many times
do I have to tell you?

03:56.404 --> 03:57.454
Don't touch my stuff.

03:58.948 --> 04:00.278
Go back inside.
It's cold.

04:08.082 --> 04:09.832
Hey, sexy. Get in!

04:09.918 --> 04:10.918
Okay.

04:19.552 --> 04:21.392
I love the sky
on mornings like this.

04:22.012 --> 04:23.013
Hey.

04:23.514 --> 04:25.314
Greasy forehead,
window, off.

04:28.478 --> 04:30.098
I'm gonna try
not to be depressed

04:30.188 --> 04:31.728
because I'm single
on Cupid Day.

04:31.940 --> 04:34.030
That's Valentine's Day
to you!

04:35.526 --> 04:37.087
Do you have insomnia
or something, Linds?

04:37.111 --> 04:38.151
Excuse me?

04:38.237 --> 04:40.557
It's just cute that you get up
before us and get breakfast.

04:40.698 --> 04:42.738
Ooh.
Did she just call me cute, Kingston?

04:42.992 --> 04:44.542
I believe she did, Edgecomb.
Mmm-mmm.

04:44.661 --> 04:48.041
Al, Linds doesn't do "cute."
No.

04:48.122 --> 04:51.132
It's not in her lexicon.
Lexicon? Nice word choice.

04:55.880 --> 04:57.010
Whoo!

04:57.173 --> 04:58.553
Come on.

05:06.391 --> 05:07.391
Seriously?

05:07.850 --> 05:10.850
Okay, this was maybe funny the
first bazillion times you did it.

05:11.813 --> 05:13.063
It's still funny.
It still is.

05:13.272 --> 05:14.862
Still funny!
Love it. Every time.

05:18.486 --> 05:19.646
Yeah, baby!

05:23.992 --> 05:25.372
No texting and driving.

05:25.451 --> 05:29.001
Don't worry. I'd never let
my best friend die a virgin.

05:29.247 --> 05:30.497
Ooh!

05:30.790 --> 05:32.101
You didn't think
we'd forget, did you?

05:32.125 --> 05:34.585
It's the big day,
opening night.

05:35.044 --> 05:38.174
Rob texted me.
He said, "I made my bed for you."

05:39.382 --> 05:40.682
That is so sweet.
Yes.

05:40.842 --> 05:43.682
No glove, no love.
You hear me?

05:44.387 --> 05:46.637
Take it!
Take it! Take it!

05:46.764 --> 05:48.075
Take it!
Take it! Take it! Take it!

05:48.099 --> 05:49.309
Shh! Okay, okay...

05:50.018 --> 05:51.537
- Watch the road. Oh, my God.
- Lindsay!

05:51.561 --> 05:53.122
All right. I'm sorry.
We're fine. We're fine.

05:53.146 --> 05:54.186
You're crazy!

05:54.272 --> 05:55.582
We're freakin' fine.

05:55.606 --> 05:57.446
<i>Go ahead
and say we're through</i>

05:57.817 --> 05:59.777
<i>I don't care,
I'll just get another you</i>

05:59.861 --> 06:01.821
<i>I'll get another dude
that look like you</i>

06:01.946 --> 06:04.091
<i>I don't
need you and you don't need me</i>

06:04.115 --> 06:05.405
<i>Give me back my house key</i>

06:06.242 --> 06:08.372
<i>You can leave it
with my new boyfriend</i>

06:08.453 --> 06:11.163
<i>You can leave it on the back
back, back porch</i>

06:11.330 --> 06:13.250
<i>I don't care, when you
leave it leave a message</i>

06:13.332 --> 06:14.632
<i>A message,
a message, a message</i>

06:14.709 --> 06:16.249
<i>You used to never
get the message</i>

06:16.335 --> 06:17.545
<i>Yeah, I talk shit</i>

06:17.628 --> 06:18.668
<i>Yeah, she's talkin' shit</i>

06:18.755 --> 06:19.915
<i>Go ahead
and say we're through</i>

06:20.590 --> 06:22.340
<i>I don't care
I'll just get another you</i>

06:22.425 --> 06:24.255
<i>I'll get another dude
that look like you</i>

06:24.343 --> 06:26.513
<i>I don't need you
and you don't need me</i>

06:26.596 --> 06:27.966
<i>Give me back my house key</i>

06:28.056 --> 06:29.346
<i>My house key
My house key</i>

06:35.188 --> 06:37.398
<i>This could be easy</i>

06:40.818 --> 06:43.238
<i>This could be easy</i>

06:46.449 --> 06:49.119
<i>This could be easy</i>

06:52.121 --> 06:54.831
<i>This could be easy</i>

07:04.092 --> 07:06.012
How many roses did you
get last year, Linds?

07:06.427 --> 07:07.637
Twenty-two.

07:07.720 --> 07:09.510
I'm going for 25
this year, though,

07:09.597 --> 07:12.057
and more than one of them
better be from Patrick.

07:13.101 --> 07:15.061
Did I tell you
I sat next to Rob,

07:15.144 --> 07:18.064
and I had to make him fill
out the request form?

07:18.272 --> 07:19.482
It was depressing.

07:20.316 --> 07:23.526
I'd be happy with 15.
I'm not ashamed to admit it.

07:24.821 --> 07:27.161
Last year, Matt literally
sent me a dozen red roses.

07:27.240 --> 07:29.870
Matt, oh, come on.

07:29.951 --> 07:31.911
You just spent
a whole week crying

07:31.994 --> 07:34.214
in the same pair of
sweatpants and it got dark.

07:34.622 --> 07:35.662
We're not going
back there.

07:35.706 --> 07:39.246
No, I've told you a thousand
times, I'll say it again,

07:40.378 --> 07:42.918
you do not need
that loser. Honestly.

07:43.047 --> 07:45.377
Mmm-mmm. Nope.
You got your real baes here.

07:45.466 --> 07:47.296
Mmm-hmm.
We love you. Come here.

07:47.760 --> 07:50.260
Till death do us part.
Even then.

07:50.429 --> 07:52.179
Oh, get in here.

07:52.306 --> 07:54.426
Mmm.

07:54.517 --> 07:55.717
All right, bitches,
let's move!

08:00.022 --> 08:02.572
Sisyphus, not an STD.

08:04.652 --> 08:05.862
What's he like?

08:06.904 --> 08:10.704
What does it mean when something
is described as being Sisyphean?

08:11.659 --> 08:14.079
Does it mean pointless?

08:15.454 --> 08:16.664
Brave?

08:18.624 --> 08:19.634
Late?

08:19.959 --> 08:22.249
Uh, sorry, it was an
emergency and a tribulation.

08:23.838 --> 08:26.508
It was a minor
LaserJet explosion.

08:26.841 --> 08:27.971
Hope the printer survived.

08:29.719 --> 08:31.139
All right,
back to Sisyphus.

08:32.054 --> 08:33.104
What's his character like?

08:33.431 --> 08:35.520
Does he learn from
pushing that boulder...

08:36.851 --> 08:37.851
Hey.

08:37.934 --> 08:38.934
Val-a-gram delivery.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.530
Happy Cupid Day.
Go ahead.

08:58.873 --> 09:00.713
Relax, it's just roses.

09:01.417 --> 09:03.167
Aw, no roses
for Anna.

09:04.003 --> 09:05.053
Is that from your boy?

09:05.129 --> 09:06.379
It's from Rob. Yeah.

09:06.631 --> 09:09.131
All right, all right. Keep it down.
Keep it down, people.

09:15.014 --> 09:16.434
It's so beautiful.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.438
I'm in heteronormative hell.

09:29.362 --> 09:31.952
Okay, okay,
let's hope third time's the charm. Okay?

09:32.990 --> 09:33.990
Sisyphus.

09:37.536 --> 09:39.536
Back to Sisyphus, class.

09:41.958 --> 09:43.328
Yo, Sam.
Hey.

09:48.464 --> 09:49.514
Man.

09:51.259 --> 09:52.799
Sam, hey.
Hi.

09:53.678 --> 09:55.048
Did you like it?
Like what?

09:55.513 --> 09:57.563
Hey, so, um,
big party tonight.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.350
Mom is going out of town.
Whoa.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.983
A huge rager, you know.
Why don't you come, yeah?

10:02.061 --> 10:03.205
I don't know
what my plans are,

10:03.229 --> 10:04.456
like, what everyone else
ends up doing...

10:04.480 --> 10:05.749
So I'll see you tonight.
I don't think so.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.403
Yeah? You know the address.
No. Kent...

10:08.276 --> 10:09.276
Smooth.

10:28.170 --> 10:30.107
- Did you guys hear about Anna?
- You mean bull dyke.

10:30.131 --> 10:31.761
Please say she tripped
over her nose.

10:32.216 --> 10:34.336
Not yet, but her
girlfriend saw this Snap

10:34.427 --> 10:35.907
that we posted
with her and that girl.

10:36.220 --> 10:37.970
She straight up
dumped her.

10:38.222 --> 10:39.222
See?
What?

10:39.307 --> 10:41.977
This is why I deserve
some public recognition,

10:42.059 --> 10:43.559
for making shit
like that happen.

10:43.894 --> 10:45.564
Maybe someone should
give me a ribbon.

10:45.938 --> 10:48.318
Like the ones that you used
to have hanging on your wall,

10:48.399 --> 10:50.279
Sammy, remember,
from horseback riding?

10:50.443 --> 10:52.033
I was, like,
ten years old, Lindsay.

10:52.111 --> 10:53.991
God, Sam, you were
such a nerd back then.

10:54.030 --> 10:56.410
Okay, but isn't it weird
how that stuff happens?

10:56.490 --> 10:57.850
How things connect
in strange ways?

10:57.908 --> 10:59.303
Like if Lindsay
didn't post that Snap...

10:59.327 --> 11:00.327
She deserved it.

11:00.453 --> 11:01.933
I'm just saying,
it's kinda crazy now.

11:02.288 --> 11:04.748
I saw this video about chaos
in the universe... Listen!

11:04.832 --> 11:07.212
How a bird flapping its
wings in South America

11:07.293 --> 11:08.923
can create a major
rainstorm in New York.

11:09.086 --> 11:12.006
Like how one person can watch a
pretentious video about chaos

11:12.089 --> 11:14.839
while three other people
actually die of boredom.

11:14.925 --> 11:17.485
It wasn't a YouTube tutorial,
so you guys wouldn't get it anyway.

11:17.553 --> 11:18.553
Owie!

11:18.679 --> 11:19.849
Samantha Kingston.

11:20.264 --> 11:21.474
- Hi.
- Hey, Rob.

11:23.476 --> 11:25.346
Did you get my rose?
I did.

11:26.103 --> 11:27.273
Who are
these ones from?

11:27.480 --> 11:28.665
Your competition.
I want to see.

11:28.689 --> 11:29.689
Your competition.

11:29.774 --> 11:31.460
Oh, Sam has no competition, Rob.
You know it.

11:31.484 --> 11:34.204
Okay. Well, neither do I, so I guess
we're perfect for each other.

11:36.113 --> 11:38.273
So you're going to
that thing at Kent's tonight?

11:39.492 --> 11:41.219
I heard he's getting a couple kegs.
I don't know.

11:41.243 --> 11:42.293
Yes!

11:43.120 --> 11:44.710
I'll text you later.
One more.

11:44.789 --> 11:46.619
No, I'm eating!
Get out!

11:47.500 --> 11:48.500
Go.
Bye.

11:48.626 --> 11:49.853
You all are too cute.
It's gross.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.297
Mmm.
Oh, you guys!

11:51.796 --> 11:54.296
Tonight our widdle Sammy
passes into womanhood.

11:54.382 --> 11:55.932
I am so proud.

11:56.008 --> 11:57.178
Shh! Stop it.

11:57.968 --> 11:58.968
I hope you shaved.

11:59.053 --> 12:00.353
Oh, my God.

12:01.972 --> 12:03.772
Don't forget to pee
before and after.

12:06.977 --> 12:09.687
Guys, guys, sociopath,
12 o'clock.

12:11.482 --> 12:13.402
Oh, God. Does she
know what a brush is?

12:13.859 --> 12:15.139
No.

12:16.654 --> 12:17.664
Norma Bates!

12:19.740 --> 12:20.980
Hey, did she get
her Val-a-gram?

12:21.325 --> 12:22.552
In chem, I was sitting
right behind her.

12:22.576 --> 12:23.616
What'd she say?

12:23.702 --> 12:24.792
Does she say anything ever?

12:24.870 --> 12:25.910
Well, what'd she do?

12:26.080 --> 12:27.320
She tossed it
right after class.

12:27.665 --> 12:28.975
She really should
appreciate it more.

12:28.999 --> 12:30.719
It's probably the only rose
she'll ever get.

12:30.876 --> 12:33.586
Maybe it had something
to do with the card.

12:33.921 --> 12:36.511
"Maybe next year,
but probably not."

12:56.110 --> 12:57.190
That's it, guys!

12:57.778 --> 12:58.778
Go, girl.

13:00.030 --> 13:01.030
I love it!

13:02.199 --> 13:03.510
It kinda looks like you
put it on your cheeks.

13:03.534 --> 13:05.704
It's the same color.
Yeah. That's the point.

13:07.121 --> 13:08.121
Mmm.

13:08.205 --> 13:09.865
Love it.
It's so effing good.

13:11.292 --> 13:12.542
Can I post this one?

13:13.961 --> 13:14.961
No.

13:16.755 --> 13:18.335
Don't laugh at me.
Okay.

13:21.719 --> 13:22.719
Linds?

13:28.058 --> 13:31.058
Were you nervous
your first time?

13:35.274 --> 13:36.734
I was too drunk
to be anything.

13:38.694 --> 13:39.774
Don't freak out
if it hurts.

13:40.654 --> 13:41.704
Especially at first.

13:41.780 --> 13:44.120
And don't tense up, because
that only makes it worse.

13:45.743 --> 13:47.953
Great. That sounds
really romantic.

13:48.621 --> 13:50.140
Don't worry. It's not like
Rob is some random guy.

13:50.164 --> 13:52.004
You actually like him.
Right. Yes.

13:52.750 --> 13:54.670
Everyone wants to
hook up with him.

13:54.793 --> 13:56.093
Yeah.

13:56.420 --> 13:58.010
Tonight, everything changes.

14:00.841 --> 14:02.471
That face.

14:03.928 --> 14:05.258
Baes!

14:07.014 --> 14:09.104
What are you doing?
What do you think you're doing?

14:24.281 --> 14:26.451
Fart's house
is actually kinda nice.

14:26.617 --> 14:27.802
If I had known,
I would have stopped

14:27.826 --> 14:29.946
calling him Danny DeVito
all year.

14:30.621 --> 14:31.711
Sam and you.

14:57.898 --> 15:00.278
Hey, I'm gonna go find Patrick.
Will you be okay?

15:00.359 --> 15:02.189
What?
I'm gonna go find Patrick.

15:02.278 --> 15:03.638
Will you be okay?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.066
Mwah!

15:13.872 --> 15:15.502
Hey, Sam!

15:16.041 --> 15:17.171
You made it.

15:22.381 --> 15:24.261
Sam! Sam!
Hi!

15:28.012 --> 15:29.642
Oh, I am sorry.
Let me get that for you.

15:32.516 --> 15:33.726
How drunk are you?

15:33.851 --> 15:35.251
I'm not drunk.
Don't worry about it.

15:35.853 --> 15:36.903
Know what?

15:38.647 --> 15:41.027
You're the hottest girl in here.
The hottest.

15:43.485 --> 15:46.815
Okay, look, I'm only gonna be
here like an hour, an hour tops.

15:46.989 --> 15:49.199
You know?
You text me and we'll go.

15:49.325 --> 15:51.365
We're just gonna go.
Just me and you. Okay.

15:55.873 --> 15:57.883
Oh, my... Okay. Sorry.
Oh.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.540
What happened?
Nothing.

16:00.377 --> 16:01.747
I'll see ya later, okay?

16:16.060 --> 16:17.860
Elody's really
embarrassing herself.

16:18.437 --> 16:19.557
Elody's a slut.

16:19.855 --> 16:21.685
Lindsay's a bitch
and a drama queen.

16:21.940 --> 16:23.690
I'm rich and have ADD.

16:24.693 --> 16:25.693
Baes!

16:26.612 --> 16:27.912
Bae!

16:28.238 --> 16:31.658
Come on.
Oh, get in here, baby!

16:33.869 --> 16:38.079
Patrick, will you go get me something
a little bit stronger than this beer?

16:38.415 --> 16:39.455
What's the magic word?

16:39.917 --> 16:41.747
Blowjob.

16:41.877 --> 16:43.457
BRB.
Thank you.

16:44.254 --> 16:46.554
Where have you been? I've been
looking everywhere for you.

16:46.632 --> 16:47.682
Have you?
Yes!

16:47.758 --> 16:48.878
Like in Patrick's mouth?

16:51.011 --> 16:52.011
Oops.

16:52.221 --> 16:55.431
What? Oh, she's so shitfaced!

16:55.641 --> 16:57.811
No, you're shitfaced,
shitface.

16:58.394 --> 17:00.944
I can't believe high
school's almost over.

17:01.188 --> 17:02.188
Aw.

17:02.272 --> 17:03.982
Well, actually, we did it right,
you know?

17:04.273 --> 17:07.324
Kissed the hottest boys,
went to the sickest parties.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.450
Do you think we'll
remember any of this?

17:13.575 --> 17:17.075
I mean, like two years,
three years from now?

17:17.454 --> 17:19.124
I won't even
remember this tomorrow.

17:30.342 --> 17:33.302
Oh, my God.

17:33.595 --> 17:34.805
What's she doing here?

17:48.277 --> 17:49.897
Up.
Okay.

18:06.503 --> 18:09.673
Hello, sweetie.
Is that your first drink?

18:10.966 --> 18:12.926
You really should
take it easy.

18:20.684 --> 18:22.144
You're a bitch!

18:24.188 --> 18:25.478
Excuse me?

18:26.565 --> 18:27.685
Whoa.

18:28.984 --> 18:30.074
You heard me.

18:31.069 --> 18:35.279
You're a goddamn fetid bitch
just like your mother.

18:35.908 --> 18:38.488
It's no wonder
Daddy left. Huh?

18:39.703 --> 18:40.930
- You're a bitch, too.
- What?

18:40.954 --> 18:41.964
You're a drunk.

18:43.207 --> 18:44.367
And you...

18:47.169 --> 18:48.521
You're just pathetic.
You know what?

18:48.545 --> 18:50.165
We'd rather be bitches
than a psycho.

18:50.255 --> 18:51.295
Yeah, psycho.

18:51.381 --> 18:54.011
Have you noticed
that nobody likes you?

18:54.718 --> 18:55.862
- Yeah, psycho.
- Psycho.

18:55.886 --> 18:57.756
Has anyone at this party...

18:57.888 --> 18:59.449
- Has anyone talked to you?
- I don't think so.

18:59.473 --> 19:00.933
You weren't even invited.

19:01.016 --> 19:02.516
That's 'cause
you're a freak.

19:02.768 --> 19:03.808
Go back to the ward.

19:03.894 --> 19:05.194
Go home.

19:08.065 --> 19:09.065
Go home.

19:14.780 --> 19:16.910
Get off me! Get off me!

19:17.658 --> 19:19.658
Who are you?

19:20.452 --> 19:21.452
You're the bitch!

19:25.457 --> 19:26.457
Psycho!

19:27.376 --> 19:28.376
Psycho!

19:29.461 --> 19:31.341
Get this bitch
on a leash!

19:31.421 --> 19:32.421
Psycho!

19:32.506 --> 19:33.506
You wanna go?

19:34.633 --> 19:35.973
Freak, get out of here!

19:41.598 --> 19:42.888
Go!

19:50.232 --> 19:53.612
Go back to the ward,
you psycho bitch!

19:57.030 --> 19:58.030
Are you okay?

20:06.164 --> 20:07.624
What the hell
was that about, huh?

20:08.709 --> 20:10.539
I don't know.
She just called us bitches...

20:10.627 --> 20:11.688
What did she do?
...in front of everybody.

20:11.712 --> 20:13.189
So you attack her?
Okay. This is not my fault!

20:13.213 --> 20:14.399
You gang up
and pour beer all over her?

20:14.423 --> 20:15.423
You know what...

20:15.966 --> 20:19.046
Who are you? Come on...
Do not touch me.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.907
You know, your boyfriend's
throwing up in my sink.

20:22.931 --> 20:24.171
So, you wanna
take care of that?

20:35.736 --> 20:36.736
Come on. Come on!

20:49.499 --> 20:51.379
That was insane.

20:53.253 --> 20:54.553
I'm sorry about Rob, bae.

20:56.089 --> 20:57.089
Music!

20:58.717 --> 21:01.967
Pacific Northwest, my ass.
I hate this weather.

21:02.304 --> 21:05.144
Do you guys wanna get some food?
I really need carbs.

21:05.557 --> 21:07.017
You sound like
my grandmother.

21:07.225 --> 21:08.935
Meh.
Here.

21:09.519 --> 21:11.372
Oh, I like this song.

21:54.231 --> 21:55.731
She called us bitches.

21:58.610 --> 21:59.820
I guess we are.

22:03.073 --> 22:04.283
What time is it?

22:05.033 --> 22:06.833
Did you see
that look in her eyes?

22:06.910 --> 22:09.120
- I mean, she just snapped.
- Yeah.

22:09.746 --> 22:10.848
She freaked me out.

22:36.481 --> 22:39.321
Sam, you're 20 minutes late!
Let's shake it, sister!

23:10.265 --> 23:12.885
Sammy, you like the bird
I made you?

23:13.351 --> 23:14.771
Mommy says
you have to get up.

23:14.978 --> 23:16.058
It's Saturday.

23:18.815 --> 23:21.355
Mommy, Sammy won't get up!

23:21.443 --> 23:23.403
Don't make me
come up there.

23:44.591 --> 23:45.681
Yeah?

23:45.759 --> 23:47.179
Sexy lady!

23:49.304 --> 23:50.434
What are you doing?

23:50.514 --> 23:53.234
I'm so sorry. I had a nightmare,
so it's a slow start.

23:53.809 --> 23:55.349
Um...

23:55.852 --> 23:57.852
What happened last night?

23:59.064 --> 24:03.694
Oh. Sorry. I was FaceTiming
with Patrick till, like, 3:00.

24:05.362 --> 24:06.532
Speaking of which,

24:07.239 --> 24:08.869
are you nervous for tonight?

24:10.200 --> 24:11.200
What?

24:12.494 --> 24:14.704
You, Rob,
his flannel sheets?

24:17.082 --> 24:18.082
I'm gonna shower.

24:18.291 --> 24:19.631
Nope, no time. Come on.

24:19.751 --> 24:20.751
It's Cupid Day.

24:27.717 --> 24:29.137
Whoo!

24:43.441 --> 24:44.651
Seriously?

24:44.734 --> 24:47.213
Okay, this was maybe funny the
first bazillion times you did it.

24:47.237 --> 24:48.487
It's still funny.

24:50.615 --> 24:51.615
Yeah, baby!

24:51.700 --> 24:53.330
Nice tits!

24:58.832 --> 25:00.332
Ooh. I have your present.

25:01.209 --> 25:04.419
No glove, no love.
You hear me?

25:04.796 --> 25:06.046
It goes on him.

25:18.977 --> 25:21.607
Sisyphus, not an STD.

25:21.771 --> 25:24.191
All right. Keep it down.
Keep it down, people.

25:29.988 --> 25:31.028
It's so beautiful.

25:31.364 --> 25:32.633
I'm in
heteronormative hell.

25:32.657 --> 25:34.487
Thank you, girls. Thank you.

25:34.576 --> 25:36.746
Okay, okay, let's hope
third time's the charm.

25:37.412 --> 25:38.502
Yo, Sam.

25:46.004 --> 25:47.014
Oh, man.

25:47.589 --> 25:49.879
Sam, you forgot this one.

25:49.966 --> 25:51.546
No, I didn't forget it.

25:51.635 --> 25:52.675
What do you mean?

25:52.761 --> 25:53.863
The more roses
you get on Cupid Day,

25:53.887 --> 25:54.947
the more popular
you are, right?

25:54.971 --> 25:57.141
Thanks for the tip, Kent.
Noted.

25:57.641 --> 25:59.201
Well, I didn't say
the rose was from me.

26:05.232 --> 26:06.652
But it is
from you, right?

26:08.652 --> 26:09.692
Well...

26:12.405 --> 26:14.485
Anyway, my mom is
out of town...

26:14.574 --> 26:16.244
Out of town and
you're having a party?

26:17.118 --> 26:19.078
Yeah. Do you
wanna come? Or...

26:19.162 --> 26:20.162
I have to go.

26:20.247 --> 26:22.707
Well, see you tonight? Or...

26:44.229 --> 26:45.479
Are you nervous?

26:46.231 --> 26:48.691
No, no, no, no, no.

26:49.818 --> 26:52.258
You don't want to waste the first
night you go full womanhood.

26:54.030 --> 26:55.910
Okay,
you sure they look good?

26:55.949 --> 26:58.302
I just really don't want to look
like I'm trying too hard, you know?

26:58.326 --> 27:00.076
You're fine.

27:03.456 --> 27:04.956
Such a weird day.

27:05.750 --> 27:06.750
Like how?

27:06.835 --> 27:08.585
Just weird.

27:08.670 --> 27:12.510
I feel like I'm still dreaming
from yesterday, like...

27:12.590 --> 27:16.010
Or maybe yesterday was the dream.
I don't know... Whoa.

27:16.094 --> 27:18.604
You're awake now!
No, no, no, no!

27:19.597 --> 27:21.807
Sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Don't. Don't do that.

27:35.322 --> 27:38.122
Oh, my God, there's so many
hot guys here tonight!

27:54.883 --> 27:57.143
I'm gonna go
find Patrick, okay?

27:57.218 --> 27:58.218
What?

27:59.471 --> 28:00.591
I'll be right back!

28:02.474 --> 28:05.314
Sam! Hey, you made it!

28:12.567 --> 28:13.897
Sam. Sam.

28:16.988 --> 28:19.068
Oh, I am sorry.
Let me get that for you.

28:19.157 --> 28:20.577
Rob, I need to talk to you.
What?

28:20.658 --> 28:21.738
About what? What's up?

28:21.826 --> 28:23.286
I'm feeling pranked.

28:24.037 --> 28:25.264
Tonight was supposed to be
our special night...

28:25.288 --> 28:27.458
No, no, no, no, no. Rob?
What?

28:27.540 --> 28:31.040
I don't feel good.
I'm freaking out.

28:32.128 --> 28:34.208
It's always something.
Can we go talk some...

28:34.297 --> 28:36.667
It's always something.
...where?

28:36.758 --> 28:41.008
Okay, Sam. Okay. I'm gonna
fill my cup up first.

28:41.096 --> 28:43.136
Five minutes.
Can you wait that long?

29:55.128 --> 29:56.298
This room is off limits.

30:00.216 --> 30:03.296
I was just looking
for the bathroom.

30:03.428 --> 30:04.508
Sorry.

30:05.138 --> 30:08.308
I feel like I'm having déjà
vu with you being in my room.

30:08.975 --> 30:12.015
Oh, my God, I've been having
déjà vu all day long.

30:16.274 --> 30:17.364
Are you okay?

30:20.612 --> 30:22.952
Yeah. Excuse me.

30:24.032 --> 30:25.782
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

30:25.867 --> 30:27.617
Yeah?
In Patrick's mouth, maybe.

30:30.830 --> 30:34.420
You seem a little guilty.
Were you with Rob, you hussy?

30:34.501 --> 30:36.171
Skank.
Harlot.

30:36.252 --> 30:37.688
Hey, are you guys
talking about me?

30:37.712 --> 30:39.148
You know what?
I think I'm gonna go home.

30:39.172 --> 30:40.592
No, no, no!
What?

30:40.673 --> 30:42.318
You don't have to drive me.
It's okay. I'll find a ride.

30:42.342 --> 30:44.302
No, we just got here.
I'm confused.

30:44.385 --> 30:47.005
I thought you were supposed
to get it on with Rob tonight.

30:47.096 --> 30:48.136
Yeah.

30:49.349 --> 30:51.939
Yeah, I changed my mind.

30:52.018 --> 30:53.898
Well, at least I'm not
gonna be the only virgin.

30:57.023 --> 31:00.073
Oh, my God.

31:00.276 --> 31:01.486
What's she doing here?

31:06.533 --> 31:07.783
Watch this.

31:14.624 --> 31:16.134
Is that your first drink?

31:21.422 --> 31:22.672
You're a bitch!

31:23.466 --> 31:24.796
Just like your mother.

31:25.343 --> 31:27.603
No wonder Daddy left. Huh?

31:28.972 --> 31:30.392
- You're a bitch, too.
- What?

31:30.473 --> 31:31.523
You're a drunk.

31:31.599 --> 31:32.849
And you...

31:34.769 --> 31:36.019
You're just pathetic.

31:36.104 --> 31:37.234
Juliet...

31:37.313 --> 31:39.291
You know what? We'd rather
be bitches than a psycho.

31:39.315 --> 31:40.315
Yeah, psycho.

31:40.400 --> 31:43.070
Have you noticed
that nobody likes you?

31:43.152 --> 31:44.380
- Yeah, psycho.
- Psycho.

31:44.404 --> 31:46.284
Has anyone at this party...

31:46.364 --> 31:47.883
- Has anyone talked to you?
- I don't think so.

31:47.907 --> 31:50.327
- Go back to the ward.
- Go home.

31:53.079 --> 31:54.409
Go home.

31:57.458 --> 31:58.628
Get off me!

32:04.841 --> 32:06.131
Go to hell!

32:06.759 --> 32:08.389
Freak, get out of here!

32:09.095 --> 32:10.595
Get the fuck out!

32:12.307 --> 32:14.137
Get this bitch
on a leash!

32:14.225 --> 32:16.305
Psycho! Psycho.
You wanna go?

32:20.023 --> 32:23.443
Go back to the ward,
you psycho bitch!

32:31.909 --> 32:33.345
What do you think
people will say about you

32:33.369 --> 32:34.619
when you die?

32:34.704 --> 32:36.334
Like I care.
I'm serious.

32:36.414 --> 32:37.464
That we're hot.

32:37.540 --> 32:39.100
This shit is morbid, Sam.

32:39.167 --> 32:40.667
Hey, watch the road.
Hey.

32:41.085 --> 32:42.187
We need music.
You watch the road.

32:42.211 --> 32:44.171
Guys, I'll find a song.

32:44.255 --> 32:45.665
I want to help you
pick a song.

32:45.757 --> 32:47.007
Okay, mom.

32:47.091 --> 32:48.131
Guys, wait.
Don't elbow me.

32:48.217 --> 32:49.587
Just pick something.

32:50.887 --> 32:52.757
You're trouble.
You always have to pee.

32:52.847 --> 32:54.427
'Cause she drinks
too much.

32:54.515 --> 32:56.675
That, and she has the
bladder of a baby squirrel.

33:07.695 --> 33:08.735
The truck.

33:09.364 --> 33:10.374
Truck?

33:10.448 --> 33:12.448
Watch out for the truck.
What truck?

33:27.548 --> 33:28.678
How did you...

33:34.889 --> 33:40.099
<i>It wasn't a dream.
It really happened. Again.</i>

34:09.632 --> 34:11.132
Sammy, you like the bird
I made you?

34:11.217 --> 34:12.717
It's origami.

34:12.802 --> 34:14.891
Mommy says
you have to get up.

34:14.971 --> 34:16.061
Tell Mom I'm sick.

34:18.474 --> 34:20.484
You don't feel hot.
Stop it.

34:30.194 --> 34:31.204
Let go!

34:32.989 --> 34:35.489
Mommy,
Sammy won't get up!

34:38.745 --> 34:41.034
<i>It wasn't until then</i>

34:41.121 --> 34:43.252
<i>that I allowed myself
to think the worst.</i>

34:43.331 --> 34:44.331
Sam?

34:45.251 --> 34:46.610
What's this about you
feeling sick?

34:47.879 --> 34:49.009
I just don't feel good.

34:49.755 --> 34:51.126
On Cupid Day?

34:58.806 --> 35:00.346
Did something happen?

35:03.478 --> 35:04.598
I don't know.

35:07.231 --> 35:08.521
Did you and Rob
have a fight?

35:08.608 --> 35:11.238
No. Mom, go away.

35:12.361 --> 35:14.661
Please don't use that tone.
I'm just trying to help.

35:14.739 --> 35:16.339
I just need to sleep
a little bit longer.

35:18.242 --> 35:19.332
Please?

35:21.454 --> 35:24.124
Okay. Well, I'll let Lindsay
know that you're going in late.

35:24.207 --> 35:26.037
But I have to be
at work by 10:00.

36:03.454 --> 36:05.044
Thank you for driving me.

36:05.122 --> 36:06.752
Sure.

36:11.128 --> 36:12.838
Sammy...
Hmm.

36:13.130 --> 36:15.800
You'll feel better once you
see some of your roses.

36:17.885 --> 36:21.715
I don't know. Maybe.

36:25.434 --> 36:27.524
Well, you're lucky
to be so popular.

36:27.603 --> 36:31.233
When I was a senior,
I hadn't even kissed a boy.

36:31.899 --> 36:33.729
Everyone said my eyes
were too close together

36:33.818 --> 36:35.438
and that I looked
like a fish.

36:37.947 --> 36:39.277
Yeah.

36:48.124 --> 36:49.834
I have to
get to work, honey.

36:51.002 --> 36:52.672
I think you're beautiful.

36:57.967 --> 36:59.797
Go.
Bye.

37:16.986 --> 37:19.656
<i>Maybe
everything was connected.</i>

37:23.034 --> 37:25.704
<i>Maybe a flock of birds
could cause a rainstorm</i>

37:25.828 --> 37:28.538
<i>and everything done
could be undone.</i>

37:33.920 --> 37:35.880
<i>Maybe things could change.</i>

37:38.424 --> 37:40.434
<i>And maybe
I could change them.</i>

37:46.015 --> 37:49.685
It's Rob.
We're having issues.

37:50.227 --> 37:52.057
But it's the day.

37:52.730 --> 37:55.020
The note in his
Val-a-gram said "Love ya."

37:56.192 --> 37:57.992
"L-U-V ya. Luv ya."

37:58.069 --> 38:00.005
What is that? We've been
going out since last year.

38:00.029 --> 38:04.029
Yeah. Well, you know, maybe he's just
waiting to say it, like, tonight.

38:04.158 --> 38:05.358
I'm not gonna
have sex with him

38:05.409 --> 38:07.289
just so that he says
"I love you."

38:07.370 --> 38:08.370
I'm not gonna
do that.

38:09.372 --> 38:11.622
We go out every weekend.
Mmm.

38:11.707 --> 38:13.207
I don't know.
I wanna stay in.

38:13.584 --> 38:14.594
Like we used to.

38:14.710 --> 38:16.300
Okay, but the only reason
we stayed in

38:16.379 --> 38:18.969
was because we weren't invited
to any senior parties.

38:19.173 --> 38:24.643
I just, bottom line, don't want to
have to deal with that today. Okay?

38:29.225 --> 38:30.225
Okay.

38:30.476 --> 38:31.476
All right.

38:32.061 --> 38:33.231
What are you doing?

38:34.772 --> 38:36.492
- What is she...
- Don't worry.

38:36.941 --> 38:38.651
Are you texting...

38:38.734 --> 38:39.784
Oh, my God.

38:39.860 --> 38:41.180
That devilish grin,
though.

38:44.907 --> 38:46.077
Oh, my God.

38:46.409 --> 38:47.909
What? What?

38:48.577 --> 38:49.930
Why did he give me that...
What did you say?

38:49.954 --> 38:53.044
Relax, I just told him
that you got your period.

38:54.458 --> 38:56.258
That's a good one. Yes.
That's perfect.

38:57.753 --> 38:59.713
- You're welcome!
- That's a good one.

38:59.755 --> 39:02.335
Lock up the knives
and babies!

39:02.425 --> 39:03.527
Does it smell
like pee in here?

39:03.551 --> 39:04.611
Yeah, I can smell her
from here.

39:04.635 --> 39:06.505
Remind me again.
Why do we hate Juliet?

39:07.930 --> 39:09.310
Are you serious?

39:09.432 --> 39:13.102
We don't hate her. It's just she's super
creepy with all those weird drawings.

39:13.477 --> 39:15.687
Remember Mellow Yellow
in the fifth grade?

39:15.771 --> 39:16.771
Oh, my God.

39:16.814 --> 39:19.114
When Lindsay found out that
she peed in her sleeping bag

39:19.191 --> 39:20.571
on the Girl Scout trip.

39:22.153 --> 39:24.033
Why do you care
all of a sudden?

39:24.113 --> 39:25.993
You know she should be
institutionalized.

39:27.116 --> 39:29.446
I was just wondering.
That's all.

39:33.622 --> 39:34.850
So, we're going over
to your house, right?

39:34.874 --> 39:36.004
Obviously.

39:37.293 --> 39:38.633
Can I borrow
something?

39:38.711 --> 39:40.961
Always. I got you.

39:57.563 --> 40:00.653
Hey. Uh, these came for you
in Daimler's class.

40:00.775 --> 40:02.605
I know I'm not wearing
the appropriate attire,

40:02.693 --> 40:04.953
but I promise
they're legitimate.

40:07.156 --> 40:08.236
Cool.

40:08.324 --> 40:10.624
Also, uh, this rose
came for you.

40:16.165 --> 40:18.665
It's kind of like
a painting of a rose.

40:18.793 --> 40:20.793
You know, it stands out
in front of all the others.

40:24.173 --> 40:25.343
Thank you.

40:25.424 --> 40:28.434
Hey, I never said
that it was from me.

40:29.512 --> 40:32.852
But, whoever it was from,
they put a lot of thought into it. So...

40:36.936 --> 40:39.516
By the way, my mom is
out of town this weekend,

40:39.647 --> 40:41.437
so I'm gonna throw
a big party tonight.

40:41.524 --> 40:42.534
Yeah.

40:42.650 --> 40:44.290
Did you remember the address?
Or do you...

40:44.318 --> 40:45.318
Hey, Sam.

40:45.528 --> 40:49.868
It was third grade, so you
probably don't remember.

40:51.367 --> 40:53.787
But do you, uh...
You think you'll come? Or...

40:53.869 --> 40:55.999
No, I can't. Sorry.

40:56.205 --> 40:58.205
Oh, come on.

40:58.332 --> 41:01.792
Well, I'm... I could have
crutches on call for you,

41:01.877 --> 41:03.677
in case you want to climb
up the tree... Kent.

41:03.796 --> 41:05.796
...and play flying squirrel.
That was one time.

41:05.881 --> 41:08.631
Look, I'm just saying. I'm prepared.
I'm prepared.

41:08.717 --> 41:11.047
Okay, glad to hear it.
So, that's a maybe, or...

41:13.556 --> 41:14.806
I don't think so.

41:14.890 --> 41:16.600
Well, I'll take
that "No" as a "Maybe."

41:16.684 --> 41:19.154
So, maybe
I'll see you tonight.

41:33.993 --> 41:35.083
Oh, God.

41:35.828 --> 41:37.748
Juliet Sykes
just arrived at the party.

41:37.830 --> 41:38.830
Gross.

41:38.914 --> 41:41.424
Yeah. The worst.
I'm so glad we didn't go.

41:42.918 --> 41:46.088
Mmm. Snapchat alert. Rob is totally
puking in the kitchen sink.

41:46.172 --> 41:47.412
Oh, I want to see that.

41:47.756 --> 41:49.076
I wanna see that.

41:49.592 --> 41:50.722
Of course he is.

41:50.926 --> 41:53.046
- I don't wanna see it. It's gross.
- Ew.

41:54.138 --> 41:55.638
You kiss that?

41:56.807 --> 41:58.493
I can't believe you made
this ice cream, Ally.

41:58.517 --> 41:59.703
It's literally better
than a restaurant's.

41:59.727 --> 42:01.288
No, it's true.
I mean, you should

42:01.312 --> 42:02.772
go to cooking school.
Screw college.

42:02.855 --> 42:04.685
Thanks, guys.
It has no dairy.

42:04.773 --> 42:06.823
Oh, you're so full
of shit.

42:06.942 --> 42:08.192
Thirty-eight.

42:08.277 --> 42:10.357
- Okay.
- You can shut up now.

42:10.446 --> 42:11.696
What?

42:14.033 --> 42:15.203
Matt's at the party.

42:15.284 --> 42:16.604
Ally, you say "Matt"
one more time

42:16.660 --> 42:17.980
and I will kill you
in your sleep.

42:18.078 --> 42:19.288
I will kill you
in your sleep.

42:19.371 --> 42:20.961
I will kill you
in your sleep.

42:24.418 --> 42:26.088
12:39.

42:50.986 --> 42:53.026
I wonder what filter
Terri uses on her photos.

42:53.113 --> 42:54.493
Major FOMO.

42:54.573 --> 42:55.743
Such a loser.

42:55.991 --> 42:57.751
Ugh, Steve's flirting
with a freshman.

42:57.826 --> 42:58.946
I love you guys.

43:00.913 --> 43:02.753
Aw, Sam...

43:06.001 --> 43:07.291
We love you, too.

43:07.670 --> 43:09.590
Aw, we love you, Sam.
Weirdo.

43:13.259 --> 43:14.719
Don't go emo on us.

43:32.319 --> 43:33.989
Shit. Where's my phone?

43:42.288 --> 43:43.708
Juliet Sykes is dead.

44:00.055 --> 44:01.555
She killed herself.

44:05.352 --> 44:07.562
But nothing happened
to her at the party.

44:08.522 --> 44:11.152
How totally insane.

44:20.242 --> 44:21.962
Could our rose have
something to do with it?

44:22.411 --> 44:23.541
Don't be stupid.

44:27.708 --> 44:29.418
God, imagine how
her family feels.

44:29.501 --> 44:31.501
Look, you can't be mean
to someone forever

44:31.587 --> 44:33.347
and then just feel badly
when they die, okay?

44:33.380 --> 44:34.840
We all knew she was crazy.

44:37.051 --> 44:39.391
God, Lindsay, she was your
best friend in fifth grade.

44:40.929 --> 44:43.429
Yeah, I remember you used
to sleep over at her house.

44:43.557 --> 44:46.847
Yeah, well, that was before
she became a sociopath, Ally.

44:46.935 --> 44:48.265
I'm going back to sleep.

44:58.030 --> 44:59.620
I'm going to sleep
in my room.

45:05.412 --> 45:06.962
I'm going with her.

45:15.130 --> 45:16.840
You were friends
with Juliet?

45:20.302 --> 45:22.392
No one even talked
to you in fifth grade,

45:22.471 --> 45:24.471
and I don't hold that
against you.

45:28.769 --> 45:30.229
You never said anything.

45:32.648 --> 45:33.917
We made fun of her
for all these years...

45:33.941 --> 45:35.151
It's not our fault.

45:51.125 --> 45:52.285
Go to sleep.

46:50.976 --> 46:55.226
<i>I did everything right.
And nothing changed.</i>

47:05.824 --> 47:08.584
<i>I woke up this mornin'</i>

47:08.660 --> 47:12.160
<i>Didn't recognize
the boy in the mirror</i>

47:12.247 --> 47:16.037
<i>Then I laughed and I said
Oh silly me, that's just me</i>

47:16.335 --> 47:20.915
<i>Then I proceeded to brush
some stranger's teeth</i>

47:21.048 --> 47:24.298
<i>But they were my teeth
and I was weightless</i>

47:24.384 --> 47:27.514
<i>Just quivering like some leaf
come in the window of a restroom</i>

47:27.596 --> 47:31.556
<i>I couldn't tell you what the
hell it was supposed to mean</i>

47:31.642 --> 47:34.312
<i>'Cause it was a Monday,
no, a Tuesday</i>

47:34.394 --> 47:36.944
<i>No, a Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday</i>

47:37.022 --> 47:40.282
<i>Then I woke up this mornin'</i>

48:02.047 --> 48:05.177
<i>The day starts
and ends the same,</i>

48:05.259 --> 48:07.389
<i>regardless of anything
I do or say.</i>

48:09.555 --> 48:11.215
<i>If that's how it works,</i>

48:11.306 --> 48:14.386
<i>I'm gonna do and say
whatever I want.</i>

48:32.160 --> 48:33.346
Oh, no, you're not wearing
that to school.

48:33.370 --> 48:34.410
My Cupid Day outfit.

48:34.496 --> 48:36.599
Yeah, well, you don't want to
give people the wrong idea.

48:36.623 --> 48:37.753
What idea is that exactly?

48:37.833 --> 48:40.093
No, this is not happening.
Go back up and change, please.

48:40.544 --> 48:43.214
This is my life. I'll do whatever
the hell I want with it.

48:44.631 --> 48:46.234
Dan, can you just jump in here, please?
Look, Sam...

48:46.258 --> 48:48.588
That's so disrespectful to
talk to your mom... Hey, Sam!

48:48.677 --> 48:50.507
Here... I told you not
to touch my stuff!

48:50.637 --> 48:52.467
That's it!
You are grounded!

48:52.806 --> 48:56.136
Grounded?
I'm already grounded.

48:59.688 --> 49:00.688
Samantha!

49:02.774 --> 49:05.364
<i>Maybe I was dead
and in hell.</i>

49:05.444 --> 49:08.454
<i>Maybe I was alive
and in hell.</i>

49:08.530 --> 49:10.870
<i>But it didn't matter.</i>

49:10.949 --> 49:12.579
<i>Nothing mattered anymore.</i>

49:17.039 --> 49:18.289
What are you wearing?

49:19.124 --> 49:20.334
Funny.

49:22.294 --> 49:23.344
Excuse me.

49:24.880 --> 49:27.550
Jeez, wake up on the wrong
side of the bed or something?

49:27.674 --> 49:28.884
For a few days now, yep.

49:29.217 --> 49:31.217
Nice tits!

49:33.221 --> 49:34.221
What happened to Sam?

49:34.473 --> 49:37.483
Uh, someone forgot to take her
happy pills this morning.

49:37.559 --> 49:38.559
I took mine.

49:38.685 --> 49:41.095
Well, I know something
that'll cheer you right up.

49:41.188 --> 49:43.648
I swear to God, Elody, if you
hand me a condom right now...

49:45.525 --> 49:48.485
But it's your present.
For your special night.

49:49.363 --> 49:50.363
Take it.

49:51.406 --> 49:53.736
Unless you want to be
a walking STD farm.

49:55.118 --> 49:56.238
You would know.

50:00.707 --> 50:02.537
At least I'm not
still a virgin.

50:03.377 --> 50:04.957
What the hell
is wrong with you?

50:06.088 --> 50:07.458
What did you just
say to me?

50:07.756 --> 50:09.796
What is it? Do you feel like
you need to prove to us

50:09.883 --> 50:11.513
that you don't give a shit?

50:11.593 --> 50:13.433
Is that what it is?

50:13.553 --> 50:15.531
'Cause guess what?
You don't need to prove anything.

50:15.555 --> 50:19.015
We all know that you don't give a
damn about anybody but yourself.

50:19.101 --> 50:20.941
We're all pretty
fucking clear on that!

50:21.144 --> 50:22.944
What the hell is
your problem today, Sam?

50:23.021 --> 50:25.271
You guys, don't fight.
Just drop it.

50:25.357 --> 50:26.567
What, you don't agree?

50:26.775 --> 50:27.775
Leave her out of it.

50:27.901 --> 50:31.451
Why? You're the one who talks shit
about both of them all the time.

50:31.571 --> 50:34.451
"Look at Elody
climbing all over Steve.

50:34.533 --> 50:36.373
"He doesn't even like her.
Look at Ally.

50:36.451 --> 50:38.701
"Oh, my God!
She's such a know-it-all.

50:38.787 --> 50:40.497
"She just loves
the sound of her own voice.

50:40.580 --> 50:42.058
"Hope Elody doesn't
puke in my car again

50:42.082 --> 50:43.442
"and make it smell
like alcoholic."

50:43.500 --> 50:44.790
Stop it, Sam.

50:48.922 --> 50:49.922
Out.

50:51.299 --> 50:52.429
Get out!

50:53.593 --> 50:54.763
Now!

50:59.975 --> 51:02.685
I'd love to hear what you say
about me behind my back.

51:24.624 --> 51:27.134
Sisyphus, not an STD.

51:30.964 --> 51:31.974
Don't say it.

51:35.343 --> 51:37.103
I'm in heteronormative hell.

51:38.972 --> 51:41.932
Okay, thank you.
Thank you, girls. Thank you.

51:42.517 --> 51:45.267
Okay, okay, let's hope third
time's the charm. Okay?

51:46.021 --> 51:47.231
Sisyphus.

51:48.690 --> 51:50.530
Sam! What?

51:51.193 --> 51:52.283
You can take 'em.

51:52.360 --> 51:54.200
Oh, Sam, you're breaking
hearts left and right.

52:00.327 --> 52:02.197
Am I breaking yours,
Mr. Daimler?

52:04.539 --> 52:05.539
What?

52:07.459 --> 52:10.379
Your heart,
am I breaking it?

52:19.471 --> 52:22.061
No. You're not.

52:22.182 --> 52:24.642
My patience, however,
is at its breaking point.

52:25.560 --> 52:27.560
Take a seat. Please.

52:28.188 --> 52:29.608
If you insist.

52:35.362 --> 52:38.242
Okay. Sisyphus.

52:39.825 --> 52:40.865
Sisyphus.

52:42.244 --> 52:44.504
Why is our friend Sisyphus
still relevant today?

52:44.579 --> 52:46.869
Why is the story
still relevant today?

53:07.936 --> 53:09.376
Don't even think about it.

53:10.105 --> 53:13.015
Turn around.
That way.

53:13.108 --> 53:14.108
Bye.

54:10.999 --> 54:12.829
<i>Get this bitch
out of here!</i>

54:13.752 --> 54:14.752
Psycho!

54:23.261 --> 54:24.351
What the hell?
Shit.

54:24.471 --> 54:26.181
What are you doing
in here?

54:29.768 --> 54:31.938
This is my bathroom.

54:37.859 --> 54:39.029
Nice shoes.

54:40.654 --> 54:41.704
Hard to walk in, huh?

54:42.030 --> 54:43.990
I can walk in them
just fine, thank you.

54:44.115 --> 54:46.235
Aw, you need
a pair of these.

54:47.369 --> 54:48.789
Comfiest shoes I ever owned.

54:48.870 --> 54:49.870
Really?

54:50.163 --> 54:52.043
All right, your loss.
Whatever.

54:52.165 --> 54:54.535
You wanna trade?

54:54.626 --> 54:56.206
Like, switch shoes?

54:57.545 --> 55:00.045
Come on, Kingston. See if I
can get in those without...

55:00.131 --> 55:01.171
Just get out.

55:01.257 --> 55:02.877
...hurting myself.
Come on, let's try it.

55:03.551 --> 55:04.891
Why not?
What?

55:05.011 --> 55:06.181
Yeah, let's do it.

55:07.514 --> 55:08.684
Come on!

55:10.058 --> 55:11.888
Why do you guys
hate me so much?

55:16.189 --> 55:19.149
I know you know what's written
in this bathroom somewhere.

55:22.904 --> 55:24.414
It's AC...

55:26.408 --> 55:29.488
Equals...
BD, right?

55:29.577 --> 55:32.867
Anna Cartulo
equals bull dyke.

55:34.040 --> 55:36.420
Or maybe it's
"biggest douchebag."

55:39.170 --> 55:42.170
But I reckon that honor definitely
belongs to Lindsay Edgecomb.

55:48.096 --> 55:49.386
So, is that it?

55:52.225 --> 55:53.805
'Cause I'm gay?

55:55.729 --> 55:56.939
I don't know.

55:59.232 --> 56:00.584
Isn't that how
it always works out?

56:00.608 --> 56:03.448
There's somebody laughing, there's
somebody being laughed at.

56:05.780 --> 56:07.280
Right.

56:09.034 --> 56:10.294
Look, whatever.

56:10.368 --> 56:15.788
Really. I mean, this whole high
school thing's just a blip.

56:18.460 --> 56:20.630
I'm not gonna remember
any of you.

56:23.965 --> 56:25.215
I win.

56:31.097 --> 56:35.137
Do you ever feel like you're living
the same day over and over again

56:35.226 --> 56:39.436
with only, like, a few
things being different?

56:43.902 --> 56:47.492
Oh, shit, Samantha.
You just described my whole life!

56:56.706 --> 56:58.496
Hey, what's up?

57:27.987 --> 57:28.987
Hey, Sam.

57:29.072 --> 57:31.322
Did you have to ask
permission to talk to me?

57:33.076 --> 57:35.946
Lindsay's just really upset
about what you said.

57:36.037 --> 57:37.327
You should apologize.

57:37.831 --> 57:40.421
Well, everything that
I said was true, so...

57:40.500 --> 57:42.130
It doesn't matter
if it's true.

57:43.128 --> 57:46.048
She's Lindsay. She's ours.
We're each other's, you know?

57:46.840 --> 57:47.840
Just apologize.

57:47.924 --> 57:49.974
You're not listening to me.
I'm not sorry.

57:50.051 --> 57:51.341
Please, Sam?

57:52.512 --> 57:55.102
Why do you care
so much, Elody?

57:57.058 --> 58:00.598
Because...
You guys are all I have.

58:17.829 --> 58:20.079
Are you still trying
to turn her against me?

58:25.920 --> 58:27.920
You're the horrible driver.

58:28.006 --> 58:30.546
You're the one always criticizing
people and hurting people.

58:30.633 --> 58:32.528
You're the one who lied about
being friends with her

58:32.552 --> 58:34.262
and then tortured her
for all these years.

58:34.387 --> 58:36.177
I just followed along
and yet...

58:40.476 --> 58:42.146
I'm the one paying for it.

58:44.355 --> 58:46.475
Sam, what are you
talking about?

58:46.608 --> 58:48.688
Whoa. What?

58:49.194 --> 58:52.074
Oh, my God.

58:59.037 --> 59:01.867
Sam, I haven't seen you in, like, forever.
Where have you...

59:25.980 --> 59:27.730
Get this bitch
on a leash!

59:27.815 --> 59:30.815
I love you. Is that what
you wanted to hear?

59:30.902 --> 59:33.782
Go back to the ward,
you psycho bitch!

01:00:01.182 --> 01:00:02.892
Sam?

01:00:20.702 --> 01:00:22.252
Hey, are you okay?

01:00:25.081 --> 01:00:29.131
Obviously, you're crying.
But is there something I can do?

01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:31.130
I'll get you a tissue.
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:34.632 --> 01:00:35.762
Thanks.
Yeah.

01:00:44.475 --> 01:00:46.725
Sorry I'm in your room.
I know there's a sign.

01:00:46.811 --> 01:00:49.311
No. Don't worry about it.

01:00:49.939 --> 01:00:51.569
The sign's just really
for other people,

01:00:51.649 --> 01:00:52.979
so they don't get
in my stuff.

01:00:54.819 --> 01:00:57.359
It's the first big party
I've ever had, so...

01:00:58.489 --> 01:01:00.069
Why'd you have one now?

01:01:03.536 --> 01:01:05.706
I figured if I had a party,
you'd come.

01:01:15.882 --> 01:01:17.012
I like your room.

01:01:17.091 --> 01:01:20.301
Yeah? It's my dad's
old den.

01:01:21.846 --> 01:01:23.676
It must get a lot of light.

01:01:23.765 --> 01:01:24.765
Yeah.

01:01:25.308 --> 01:01:28.688
It's like waking up
in the middle of the sun.

01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:32.610
I get to see the old tree.

01:01:33.441 --> 01:01:36.611
I like it.
It's constant.

01:01:39.197 --> 01:01:40.617
Is that the one
we used to sit in?

01:01:42.283 --> 01:01:44.293
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

01:01:45.828 --> 01:01:48.538
Do you remember
climbing up it?

01:01:48.956 --> 01:01:51.286
And then you jumped down
and sprained your ankle?

01:01:52.043 --> 01:01:53.423
I was stupid.

01:01:55.171 --> 01:01:56.671
It was very ambitious.

01:01:59.801 --> 01:02:00.891
I should go.
Hey, hey, hey.

01:02:00.968 --> 01:02:04.178
Hey. Just stay for
a second. Okay?

01:02:08.810 --> 01:02:11.350
I can drive you home or...

01:02:11.479 --> 01:02:12.979
I don't want to go home.

01:02:16.401 --> 01:02:18.491
Okay, well, you can, uh...

01:02:18.569 --> 01:02:20.699
You could crash here
if you want.

01:02:22.156 --> 01:02:24.156
Not, like, with me.

01:02:25.159 --> 01:02:27.749
Somewhere else.
I'll be somewhere else.

01:02:29.330 --> 01:02:31.830
Bed completely to yourself.

01:02:31.999 --> 01:02:33.919
The Kent McFuller
master suite.

01:02:39.382 --> 01:02:40.382
Yeah?

01:02:41.676 --> 01:02:42.676
Okay.

01:02:44.178 --> 01:02:46.508
Hey, it's okay.

01:02:54.272 --> 01:02:55.312
Here.

01:03:06.033 --> 01:03:07.543
I'm sorry about earlier.

01:03:08.911 --> 01:03:10.251
Don't worry about that.

01:03:10.371 --> 01:03:12.461
No, I'm sorry

01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:14.500
I've always been
so mean to you.

01:03:20.381 --> 01:03:22.471
Don't look.
Don't read it. Please?

01:03:22.717 --> 01:03:24.047
Why? It's...
It's something bad.

01:03:27.013 --> 01:03:28.063
Okay.

01:03:33.686 --> 01:03:35.146
Your skin's so hot.

01:03:35.563 --> 01:03:39.403
It's always like that.

01:03:54.290 --> 01:03:56.250
I wish we could
be here forever.

01:04:15.436 --> 01:04:16.766
Okay, let's try again.

01:04:22.276 --> 01:04:23.556
We're taking a day off.

01:04:24.487 --> 01:04:26.947
I think you're just
gonna drool around.

01:04:27.782 --> 01:04:28.782
What is it?

01:04:28.908 --> 01:04:31.448
And then you're just gonna go
through there and then like that.

01:04:32.119 --> 01:04:34.789
<i>If I was going to relive
the same day over and over,</i>

01:04:36.332 --> 01:04:38.462
<i>I wanted it to
be a worthy day.</i>

01:04:46.926 --> 01:04:48.256
<i>But not just for me.</i>

01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:08.632
Do the kids at school
ever make fun of you

01:05:08.656 --> 01:05:09.816
for the way that you talk?

01:05:12.994 --> 01:05:14.164
Sometimes.

01:05:16.872 --> 01:05:18.512
<i>You can do
something about that.</i>

01:05:20.543 --> 01:05:22.463
<i>You know, you can learn
to talk differently.</i>

01:05:23.588 --> 01:05:26.628
But this is my voice. How will
kids even know it's me talking?

01:05:29.218 --> 01:05:30.468
When I was
in the fifth grade,

01:05:30.553 --> 01:05:35.353
this girl used to
sing this song.

01:05:36.684 --> 01:05:39.524
<i>She smells like manure
and she lived in the sewer</i>

01:05:39.645 --> 01:05:41.515
<i>Samantha Kingston</i>

01:05:41.856 --> 01:05:43.146
Who did that?

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:46.150
Lindsay.

01:05:51.490 --> 01:05:53.080
<i>How come
you're so mean to Mom?</i>

01:05:57.872 --> 01:05:59.122
I'm not mean to Mom.

01:06:00.041 --> 01:06:02.081
You drew a line on
the floor with nail polish

01:06:02.168 --> 01:06:03.838
and said
she couldn't cross it.

01:06:05.838 --> 01:06:07.008
Mom and I had a fight,

01:06:07.089 --> 01:06:08.549
and I was mad at her
in the moment,

01:06:08.633 --> 01:06:10.013
but I didn't...

01:06:12.178 --> 01:06:14.718
I didn't think that
she'd actually stay away.

01:06:21.354 --> 01:06:22.364
<i>Look at that.</i>

01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:24.082
That's just the outside,
how pretty it was.

01:06:24.106 --> 01:06:25.396
Oh, my gosh.
Look at you guys.

01:06:25.524 --> 01:06:27.944
- Can you send those to me?
- Aw!

01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:29.859
So cute!
Those are beautiful.

01:06:30.029 --> 01:06:32.029
Remember when you used to
come here all the time?

01:06:32.573 --> 01:06:33.663
I do. Of course.

01:06:34.659 --> 01:06:37.369
Then your daughter
got too cool, so...

01:06:37.745 --> 01:06:39.705
- I'm just kidding.
- Can we go watch the pizza?

01:06:39.747 --> 01:06:42.077
Okay. Wait, tiger.

01:06:47.838 --> 01:06:49.008
I'm glad we did this.

01:06:49.090 --> 01:06:52.890
Yeah. It was really sweet
what you did today.

01:06:58.265 --> 01:06:59.805
Do you think
I'm a good person?

01:07:02.770 --> 01:07:05.560
Of course I think you're a good person.

01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:08.610
But it doesn't
really matter what I think.

01:07:08.734 --> 01:07:10.534
I mean, what's important
is what you think.

01:07:10.611 --> 01:07:13.031
No, I'm serious.
I want to know...

01:07:14.281 --> 01:07:16.621
Why do you think
that I'm a good person?

01:07:22.957 --> 01:07:25.877
Do you remember when
you were a little girl?

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:29.210
You used to take turns riding
all of the horses in the stable

01:07:29.296 --> 01:07:31.416
so that none of them
would feel left out?

01:07:32.216 --> 01:07:33.466
Do you remember that?

01:07:33.884 --> 01:07:35.474
I do.
Mmm-hmm.

01:07:37.555 --> 01:07:40.635
But I was a little girl.
It's different.

01:07:41.934 --> 01:07:44.814
But you have a big heart, Sam.
That doesn't go away.

01:07:47.606 --> 01:07:48.816
One good thing.

01:07:48.899 --> 01:07:53.819
You just focus
on that one good thing,

01:07:53.904 --> 01:07:55.914
and you see
where it leads you.

01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:12.090
<i>How is it possible
to change so much</i>

01:08:12.173 --> 01:08:14.843
<i>and not be able to
change anything at all?</i>

01:08:22.767 --> 01:08:24.636
<i>I knew
I had to do something.</i>

01:08:27.313 --> 01:08:28.483
<i>Something good.</i>

01:09:22.576 --> 01:09:23.576
You made it.

01:09:24.370 --> 01:09:25.410
Oh. Sorry.

01:09:26.205 --> 01:09:27.745
The room's off limits.

01:09:28.082 --> 01:09:31.131
No. Forget the sign.
It's no big deal.

01:09:31.210 --> 01:09:32.850
That's really just there
for other people,

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:34.840
so they don't mess
with my stuff.

01:09:36.006 --> 01:09:37.006
I'm glad you came.

01:09:37.091 --> 01:09:40.430
Yeah. I had to. I like what
you've done with the place.

01:09:40.511 --> 01:09:44.850
Yeah, this used to be
my dad's old den.

01:09:45.015 --> 01:09:48.135
Now it's the Kent McFuller
master suite.

01:09:49.687 --> 01:09:51.807
Yeah, not so good
in the morning, though.

01:09:54.066 --> 01:09:56.776
It's like waking up in...
In the middle of the sun.

01:10:01.699 --> 01:10:02.829
Yeah.

01:10:09.582 --> 01:10:11.792
I hope you don't think
that it's weird

01:10:11.876 --> 01:10:14.086
that I'm here
with you right now.

01:10:15.588 --> 01:10:17.128
Sam, um...

01:10:18.799 --> 01:10:22.509
I once wore Crocs
for 365 days straight,

01:10:22.595 --> 01:10:25.595
so I don't think
anything's weird.

01:10:26.473 --> 01:10:27.701
I forgot about
your Crocs phase.

01:10:27.725 --> 01:10:28.845
Yeah.

01:10:36.775 --> 01:10:39.145
Why are you always
so nice to me?

01:10:44.783 --> 01:10:51.583
Well, do you remember in third
grade right after my dad died?

01:10:52.833 --> 01:10:57.633
We were in the cafeteria
and I was crying,

01:10:58.714 --> 01:11:03.934
and Phil Howe came up to me,
called me a baby,

01:11:04.011 --> 01:11:07.641
and then smacked my tray
right out of my hand,

01:11:07.723 --> 01:11:10.683
and food went
flying everywhere.

01:11:12.102 --> 01:11:13.413
I remember what
we were eating, too.

01:11:13.437 --> 01:11:16.437
It was, um, mashed potatoes
and turkey burgers.

01:11:16.523 --> 01:11:20.363
And you came over,

01:11:20.444 --> 01:11:23.704
you scooped up the mashed
potatoes right off the ground

01:11:23.781 --> 01:11:26.951
and you went up to
Phil and you smashed

01:11:27.034 --> 01:11:28.834
the mashed potatoes
right in his face.

01:11:30.579 --> 01:11:34.039
And you then said,
"You're worse than a hot lunch,"

01:11:34.291 --> 01:11:38.051
which, at the time,
was a really good insult.

01:11:38.712 --> 01:11:42.552
I mean, I didn't laugh
more that day than...

01:11:42.633 --> 01:11:43.883
I mean...

01:11:47.346 --> 01:11:53.306
It was the first time I laughed
since my dad died and I...

01:11:58.649 --> 01:12:00.479
Do you remember
what I said to you?

01:12:07.324 --> 01:12:08.874
"You're my hero."

01:12:09.827 --> 01:12:10.997
Yeah.

01:12:13.497 --> 01:12:16.577
And that day I vowed
to be your hero, too.

01:12:19.044 --> 01:12:20.594
No matter how long
it took.

01:12:32.766 --> 01:12:34.096
Look, I'm sorry.

01:12:34.184 --> 01:12:37.864
No, don't do...
Don't be sorry. It's okay.

01:12:40.357 --> 01:12:41.397
Good.

01:12:43.068 --> 01:12:44.698
'Cause I'm not really sorry.

01:13:08.552 --> 01:13:09.852
Shit.
Wait.

01:13:17.394 --> 01:13:18.944
Sam! Hey!

01:13:19.438 --> 01:13:21.068
Sam, wait, I...

01:13:22.524 --> 01:13:24.234
Oh, my God,
Sam, did you see that?

01:13:25.486 --> 01:13:26.486
Hey, Sam.

01:13:27.321 --> 01:13:28.991
Did you see
where Juliet went?

01:13:31.241 --> 01:13:32.331
Juliet, stop!

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:41.090
Juliet!

01:13:42.169 --> 01:13:44.249
Juliet! Wait!

01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:56.180
Juliet!

01:13:59.937 --> 01:14:01.357
Juliet!

01:14:03.857 --> 01:14:05.187
Juliet!

01:14:15.536 --> 01:14:16.866
Juliet, wait!

01:14:40.519 --> 01:14:41.559
Juliet!

01:14:47.526 --> 01:14:48.526
Juliet!

01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:56.410
Juliet!

01:15:03.667 --> 01:15:05.787
Juliet!
What are you doing?

01:15:05.919 --> 01:15:07.564
I know what happened back there.
Get away from me.

01:15:07.588 --> 01:15:08.731
And I feel
really bad about it,

01:15:08.755 --> 01:15:09.899
and I know
this may sound crazy,

01:15:09.923 --> 01:15:12.263
but I have a feeling I may
be able to understand you

01:15:12.342 --> 01:15:13.842
better than you think
that I could.

01:15:13.927 --> 01:15:15.257
You hate me.

01:15:19.766 --> 01:15:21.436
I don't hate you.

01:15:22.269 --> 01:15:24.519
I know we haven't always
been the nicest to you,

01:15:24.605 --> 01:15:28.025
but the thing is that Lindsay
didn't mean anything by it.

01:15:28.108 --> 01:15:29.419
We didn't know
what we were doing.

01:15:29.443 --> 01:15:31.533
I used to be friends
with Lindsay.

01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:35.870
It was right before
her parents got divorced.

01:15:35.949 --> 01:15:37.260
I used to sleep over
at her house.

01:15:37.284 --> 01:15:39.454
Her parents would be
fighting so bad.

01:15:41.288 --> 01:15:42.788
She was so upset.

01:15:45.542 --> 01:15:48.592
She was so upset,
she started wetting the bed.

01:15:50.130 --> 01:15:53.550
You remember the name you
all gave me in fifth grade?

01:15:53.634 --> 01:15:55.474
The name Lindsay gave me?

01:15:57.638 --> 01:15:58.928
"Mellow Yellow."

01:16:00.015 --> 01:16:01.135
Remember that?

01:16:02.017 --> 01:16:03.187
You remember
the camping trip

01:16:03.268 --> 01:16:05.148
when I supposedly peed
in my sleeping bag?

01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:06.480
It was Lindsay.

01:16:07.481 --> 01:16:09.861
Lindsay's the one
who peed.

01:16:11.693 --> 01:16:13.013
When everyone asked
what happened,

01:16:13.070 --> 01:16:14.570
she just pointed
her finger at me

01:16:14.655 --> 01:16:16.485
and screamed,
"She did it."

01:16:18.659 --> 01:16:19.659
Juliet...

01:16:22.996 --> 01:16:24.286
Please let me help you.

01:16:28.961 --> 01:16:31.051
It doesn't matter now.

01:16:48.605 --> 01:16:49.855
Hey.

01:16:51.316 --> 01:16:53.316
It's like your Val-a-gram
always said...

01:16:55.862 --> 01:17:00.202
"Maybe next year, but...

01:17:02.077 --> 01:17:03.537
"Probably not."

01:17:05.247 --> 01:17:06.247
Juliet.

01:17:51.084 --> 01:17:53.804
<i>For the first time,
when I wake up,</i>

01:17:55.088 --> 01:18:01.638
<i>I'm not scared
or confused or angry.</i>

01:18:07.225 --> 01:18:11.975
<i>Because, for the first time,
I truly understand what needs to happen.</i>

01:18:23.492 --> 01:18:26.452
<i>I truly understand
how to live this day.</i>

01:18:39.424 --> 01:18:40.804
Oh, thank you.
Yeah.

01:18:40.884 --> 01:18:42.054
Want something to eat?

01:18:43.804 --> 01:18:46.564
I'm good, thanks.
Lindsay's got it covered.

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:48.180
Mom?
Oh.

01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:49.600
I love you.

01:18:50.644 --> 01:18:51.654
I love you, too.

01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:56.320
What, no love
for your old man?

01:18:56.441 --> 01:18:58.111
I love you, too,
old man.

01:18:58.193 --> 01:19:00.283
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:19:07.828 --> 01:19:09.578
Sammy, you forgot
your gloves!

01:19:10.247 --> 01:19:12.327
What would I do
without you?

01:19:16.670 --> 01:19:17.670
Hey.

01:19:19.965 --> 01:19:23.635
You are perfect
the way that you are, Fizzy.

01:19:26.012 --> 01:19:27.432
Always remember that.

01:19:38.817 --> 01:19:40.317
I can't breathe!

01:19:56.543 --> 01:19:58.383
It's cold!
Yeah.

01:20:39.252 --> 01:20:40.422
What are you doing?

01:20:41.004 --> 01:20:44.224
Auditioning for a Tampax commercial?
Let's go.

01:20:56.603 --> 01:20:57.853
Yeah, baby!

01:20:59.606 --> 01:21:01.816
Nice tits! Get in!

01:21:03.235 --> 01:21:04.235
Yes.

01:21:05.070 --> 01:21:06.400
You know how I like it.

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:15.250
Hey, Elody.

01:21:16.289 --> 01:21:17.767
What, do I have
white stuff on my face?

01:21:17.791 --> 01:21:19.631
You know why I love you?

01:21:21.127 --> 01:21:24.297
I love you because you're
down for anything. Always.

01:21:25.298 --> 01:21:26.548
You know
I'm a down-ass bitch.

01:21:26.633 --> 01:21:27.683
You are.

01:21:27.759 --> 01:21:29.139
Hey, I'm down, too.

01:21:29.302 --> 01:21:31.052
Ooh. Okay.

01:21:32.722 --> 01:21:36.562
No, I love you, Ally, because
you're curious about the world.

01:21:38.603 --> 01:21:40.733
And you're passionate,
and you are driven.

01:21:40.814 --> 01:21:43.154
Did someone swallow Oprah
this morning?

01:21:47.279 --> 01:21:48.489
I love you, Linds.

01:21:50.282 --> 01:21:52.582
I love you because
you're the kind of friend

01:21:52.659 --> 01:21:54.409
that toilet-papers
Jason Foster's house

01:21:54.494 --> 01:21:56.204
for a week straight
all by herself

01:21:56.288 --> 01:21:58.158
just because he said
that I was a bad kisser.

01:22:01.167 --> 01:22:02.287
Asshole.

01:22:07.591 --> 01:22:11.601
Oh, uh, I think I know why
Sam's in such a good mood.

01:22:14.639 --> 01:22:16.849
Oh.
It goes on him.

01:22:29.696 --> 01:22:31.156
Thank you so much
for that.

01:22:46.171 --> 01:22:48.721
Sisyphus, not an STD.

01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:50.970
Sorry, it was an emergency
and a tribulation.

01:22:51.051 --> 01:22:53.141
A minor LaserJet explosion.

01:22:53.219 --> 01:22:54.469
Val-a-gram delivery.

01:22:54.554 --> 01:22:55.564
Happy Cupid Day.

01:22:57.891 --> 01:22:58.981
It's so beautiful.

01:22:59.059 --> 01:23:00.328
I'm in heteronormative hell.

01:23:00.352 --> 01:23:01.352
I like your boots.

01:23:02.062 --> 01:23:03.582
Sisyphus fails every time,

01:23:05.148 --> 01:23:09.188
but he still thinks that he'll be
able to push that boulder uphill.

01:23:10.362 --> 01:23:12.072
He's imprisoned
by his own hubris.

01:23:13.198 --> 01:23:15.658
The only way to escape
is to change.

01:23:16.534 --> 01:23:17.584
Be careful.

01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:21.580
Oh, man.

01:23:21.706 --> 01:23:23.746
Sam. Hey.
Hey.

01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:26.919
Um... "You're my hero."

01:23:27.003 --> 01:23:28.593
You got a secret admirer?

01:23:28.713 --> 01:23:32.013
Secret?
That's not so secret.

01:23:32.092 --> 01:23:34.092
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:23:34.177 --> 01:23:35.217
Well, um...

01:23:36.388 --> 01:23:40.138
Well, hey, listen, I'm having
a party tonight. Mmm-hmm.

01:23:40.350 --> 01:23:43.650
And I was wondering if you
maybe wanted to come,

01:23:44.729 --> 01:23:46.859
maybe? Yeah? No?

01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:48.440
What's in it for me?

01:23:49.275 --> 01:23:51.275
What's in it for me?

01:23:54.572 --> 01:23:57.372
Yeah. And, um,

01:23:57.450 --> 01:23:59.540
I have something I want to
tell you later. A secret.

01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:01.960
Later? Okay.
Yes. Okay.

01:24:02.622 --> 01:24:04.962
Wait, the "you're my hero"
thing, how did you...

01:24:05.125 --> 01:24:08.245
Thank you for my beautiful rose.
I love it.

01:24:15.677 --> 01:24:18.007
What'd you say to me?
This is not working out.

01:24:19.139 --> 01:24:21.139
Okay, Sam, you can't
break up with me.

01:24:21.266 --> 01:24:26.056
I think I can
and I think I just did.

01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:30.149
I should've picked Elody.

01:24:36.322 --> 01:24:37.492
What just happened?

01:24:37.949 --> 01:24:39.309
You guys were
supposed to...

01:24:39.367 --> 01:24:41.407
I mean, you said
you wanted to...

01:24:43.413 --> 01:24:45.003
It's Rob Cokran.

01:24:46.583 --> 01:24:47.753
He doesn't deserve me.

01:24:48.334 --> 01:24:50.174
Nonetheless,
very shocking.

01:24:50.295 --> 01:24:52.585
Sociopath,
12 o'clock.

01:24:52.756 --> 01:24:53.836
Uh-oh.

01:24:53.923 --> 01:24:55.483
Does it smell
like pee in here?

01:24:55.508 --> 01:24:56.758
Stop.

01:24:56.843 --> 01:24:58.433
Norma Bates!
What?

01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:01.180
Just don't.

01:25:01.514 --> 01:25:02.524
But it's Juliet.

01:25:02.849 --> 01:25:05.349
Exactly, it's Juliet.

01:25:05.477 --> 01:25:08.017
She has a name
and she is a person.

01:25:08.354 --> 01:25:09.904
Yesterday, you said
you were afraid

01:25:09.981 --> 01:25:12.031
she would bite you
if she got too close.

01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:15.650
That was
a long time ago.

01:25:18.156 --> 01:25:19.406
That was yesterday.

01:26:03.326 --> 01:26:04.326
Hey, Linds.

01:26:04.410 --> 01:26:06.250
All right,
well, let's do this!

01:26:06.371 --> 01:26:07.661
Linds.
What?

01:26:08.414 --> 01:26:10.924
How come you never told me
about your parents' divorce?

01:26:12.836 --> 01:26:13.996
Are you serious?

01:26:15.421 --> 01:26:16.421
Yeah.

01:26:18.675 --> 01:26:21.755
Why would I talk about something
that happened a thousand years ago?

01:26:23.179 --> 01:26:24.929
Because it happened to you.

01:26:26.099 --> 01:26:27.269
And you matter to me.

01:26:27.433 --> 01:26:28.577
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:26:28.601 --> 01:26:29.703
Come here.
Okay? Let's go inside.

01:26:29.727 --> 01:26:30.767
Come here.

01:26:34.524 --> 01:26:37.614
You know you don't have to
act so tough all the time.

01:26:38.403 --> 01:26:39.403
Mmm.

01:26:43.116 --> 01:26:44.946
Don't worry about me, okay?

01:26:46.494 --> 01:26:47.704
I love you no matter what.

01:26:47.787 --> 01:26:49.117
Let's get inside.
Okay.

01:26:50.290 --> 01:26:51.850
Move, move, move.

01:27:00.133 --> 01:27:02.263
Hey, um, you made it.

01:27:02.719 --> 01:27:03.889
Come with me.

01:27:03.970 --> 01:27:05.600
What? Okay.

01:27:07.098 --> 01:27:08.468
What?

01:27:12.729 --> 01:27:15.979
I believe
you owe me a secret, right?

01:27:16.107 --> 01:27:17.397
I believe I do.

01:27:17.483 --> 01:27:19.153
Okay, so let's hear it.

01:27:23.489 --> 01:27:27.739
The secret is
yours was the best kiss

01:27:27.827 --> 01:27:30.327
that I've ever had
in my entire life.

01:27:33.458 --> 01:27:35.168
Um...

01:27:35.335 --> 01:27:38.835
But we haven't kissed.

01:27:42.342 --> 01:27:44.182
I mean,
not since the third grade.

01:27:46.804 --> 01:27:49.774
Better get started then.
I don't have much time.

01:28:21.506 --> 01:28:22.626
What was that for?

01:28:23.883 --> 01:28:25.723
Because I wanted to.

01:28:30.848 --> 01:28:32.138
I love you.

01:28:48.408 --> 01:28:50.328
Juliet, I need to
talk to you.

01:28:50.410 --> 01:28:52.080
Just for a second.
It's okay. Please?

01:28:52.161 --> 01:28:53.889
Actually, I kind of have
somewhere I have to be.

01:28:53.913 --> 01:28:55.473
I know what you have
planned for tonight

01:28:55.748 --> 01:28:58.668
and I want you to know that you
don't have to do this. Okay?

01:28:58.751 --> 01:28:59.841
You don't know anything.

01:28:59.919 --> 01:29:02.049
I know that you have
something to tell me.

01:29:02.422 --> 01:29:04.172
You have something
to tell all of us.

01:29:04.257 --> 01:29:05.427
You're a bitch.

01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:09.100
I have been a bitch.

01:29:10.430 --> 01:29:12.533
I have been a bitch.
We all have been bitches, and I...

01:29:12.557 --> 01:29:13.557
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

01:29:13.599 --> 01:29:15.244
Listen to me.
I'm trying to tell you how sorry...

01:29:15.268 --> 01:29:16.268
I am sorry.
You said that.

01:29:16.394 --> 01:29:17.914
I'm sorry,
but I have to come with you.

01:29:18.563 --> 01:29:19.863
Leave me alone!
I can't.

01:29:19.939 --> 01:29:21.109
Sam! Sam!

01:29:21.232 --> 01:29:23.168
Why did you run away from me?
I can't talk to you right now.

01:29:23.192 --> 01:29:25.004
You've been ignoring me for
years, and then you...

01:29:25.028 --> 01:29:27.358
You kiss me and then go back
to acting like I'm invisible?

01:29:27.447 --> 01:29:29.167
I meant everything
that happened back there.

01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:30.676
That's all I can say,
that I meant it,

01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:32.094
and I wish it hadn't
taken me so long.

01:29:32.118 --> 01:29:36.618
Sam, are you in trouble?
You can trust me.

01:29:37.582 --> 01:29:39.042
You can trust me back.

01:29:44.422 --> 01:29:45.422
Juliet!

01:29:48.259 --> 01:29:49.259
Juliet!

01:29:57.810 --> 01:29:58.810
Juliet!

01:30:09.822 --> 01:30:10.992
Juliet!

01:30:12.325 --> 01:30:13.445
Juliet, don't!

01:30:14.952 --> 01:30:16.162
Wait! Wait!

01:30:16.746 --> 01:30:18.826
Why? What's going on?
Why are you following me?

01:30:18.915 --> 01:30:20.915
Why can't you
leave me alone?

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.000
You don't want to die.

01:30:23.252 --> 01:30:25.132
You want the pain
to stop.

01:30:26.506 --> 01:30:28.416
Stop. You stop.

01:30:28.508 --> 01:30:30.758
You don't know me.

01:30:30.843 --> 01:30:32.763
You could never understand.

01:30:32.845 --> 01:30:34.755
You have a choice, Juliet.

01:30:34.847 --> 01:30:36.427
Not everybody gets that.

01:30:36.516 --> 01:30:37.636
Sam!

01:30:39.685 --> 01:30:40.975
Please let me help you.

01:30:41.312 --> 01:30:42.772
Don't you get it?

01:30:44.273 --> 01:30:45.533
You can't help me.

01:30:47.193 --> 01:30:48.783
I can't be fixed.

01:30:48.861 --> 01:30:50.451
You're not the one
who needs fixing.

01:30:50.530 --> 01:30:52.030
There is nothing
wrong with you.

01:30:52.156 --> 01:30:54.276
Don't let anyone tell you
that there is.

01:30:56.994 --> 01:31:01.874
This is just a blip.
Your life will change, Juliet.

01:31:03.292 --> 01:31:07.712
If you just hold on
for one more minute.

01:31:15.388 --> 01:31:16.428
It's too late.

01:31:17.557 --> 01:31:20.227
No, it's not.
It's never too late.

01:31:25.398 --> 01:31:26.398
Juliet, stop!

01:31:40.872 --> 01:31:42.582
<i>Maybe for you
there's a tomorrow.</i>

01:31:45.251 --> 01:31:49.921
<i>Maybe for you
there's 1,000 or 3,000</i>

01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:53.550
<i>or 10.</i>

01:31:56.762 --> 01:32:00.102
<i>But for some of us,
there's only today.</i>

01:32:02.435 --> 01:32:04.595
<i>And what you do today matters.</i>

01:32:05.605 --> 01:32:06.685
<i>In the moment</i>

01:32:09.567 --> 01:32:11.317
<i>and maybe into infinity.</i>

01:32:13.404 --> 01:32:15.034
<i>I see only my greatest hits.</i>

01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:27.790
<i>I see the things
I want to remember.</i>

01:32:32.131 --> 01:32:34.181
<i>And be remembered for.</i>

01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:44.350
<i>That's when I realized that
certain moments go on forever.</i>

01:32:47.939 --> 01:32:50.479
<i>Even after they're over,
they still go on.</i>

01:32:53.986 --> 01:32:55.316
<i>They are the meaning.</i>

01:32:57.823 --> 01:32:58.823
Sam?

01:33:00.493 --> 01:33:01.793
Sam?

01:33:04.330 --> 01:33:06.000
You saved me.

01:33:08.834 --> 01:33:09.844
<i>No.</i>

01:33:11.504 --> 01:33:13.304
<i>You saved me.</i>

01:33:14.305 --> 01:33:20.870
