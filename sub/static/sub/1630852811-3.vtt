00:02.000 --> 00:03.880
How you doing?  You're a doctor. I'm
not doing your bloody job for you.

00:03.880 --> 00:05.760
Always with your nose in a book.
You probably haven't got there yet.

00:05.760 --> 00:07.640
Your nose is the pointy bit
on the front of your face.

00:07.640 --> 00:10.200
I wouldn't recognise your mum
if I bumped into her in John Lewis.

00:10.200 --> 00:13.840
What does your girlfriend do?
Graphic design.

00:13.840 --> 00:16.480
Will you marry me?  No.
What's going on?

00:16.480 --> 00:18.000
You misdiagnosed his mother so

00:18.000 --> 00:20.080
he was delivered about 15
weeks too early.

00:20.080 --> 00:23.240
You're lucky to have Adam to
learn from. Don't do what he does.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.080
Yeah, bit of bad news, I'm afraid.

00:25.080 --> 00:26.600
The mum's lodged a complaint.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.360
I really did try my best for you.

00:35.920 --> 00:38.000
Hey, someone! Look, find a doctor.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.240
She's fainted.
I think she's having a fit.

00:40.240 --> 00:41.720
Is anyone here a doctor?

00:43.360 --> 00:47.040
We need a doctor! Anyone?

00:47.040 --> 00:48.960
Are you...?  A GP.

00:48.960 --> 00:50.400
Dentist.

00:50.400 --> 00:51.800
Trainee dentist.

01:03.600 --> 01:05.840
BELL RINGS

01:05.840 --> 01:08.240
TANNOY:  Please be seated,
ladies and gentlemen...

01:08.240 --> 01:10.040
Ah, right.
..as the second half

01:10.040 --> 01:11.680
is about to commence.  Shit.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.520
Excuse me.

01:21.880 --> 01:23.360
Excuse me. Sorry.

01:25.160 --> 01:27.760
The locum didn't turn up.
I'm really sorry.

01:27.760 --> 01:29.920
I'll make it up to you
if it's the last thing I do.

01:29.920 --> 01:32.040
I think this might be
the last thing you do.

01:33.480 --> 01:35.800
Hi. Hi.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.480
How was the first half, then?

01:43.480 --> 01:47.240
Oh, my God, the, the music
and the costumes....

01:47.240 --> 01:49.280
And how do they remember
all the words?

01:49.280 --> 01:51.120
It's really...  It was awful.

01:51.120 --> 01:53.520
I think you could hear Stephen
Sondheim spinning in his grave.

01:53.520 --> 01:55.720
I think he's still alive,
isn't he?  Poor man.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.760
Could I grab anyone a drink
from the bar before the...?

01:59.760 --> 02:02.200
Plus, we were saddled with an
understudy,

02:02.200 --> 02:04.000
with barely ten minutes' notice.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.880
That is really annoying. Which part?

02:12.480 --> 02:14.040
Would your friend like a chocolate?

02:14.040 --> 02:15.640
Boyfriend, actually.

02:40.320 --> 02:41.880
TICKING

02:41.880 --> 02:44.200
HE GASPS Stop fidgeting!

02:52.600 --> 02:54.240
I don't know if Adam mentioned,

02:54.240 --> 02:56.400
but we'd love to take you
for dinner.

02:56.400 --> 02:59.000
Oh, we should probably
get off, actually.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.080
You sure we can't tempt you
for a quick bite?

03:01.080 --> 03:02.600
We've got a table booked at this

03:02.600 --> 03:04.480
little French place
on Poland Street.

03:04.480 --> 03:05.720
My friend's a waiter there.

03:05.720 --> 03:07.360
Well...

03:07.360 --> 03:09.120
I'll call you in a couple of weeks.

03:17.640 --> 03:19.560
Fucking hell.

03:19.560 --> 03:21.800
The handshakes.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.160
To be fair, she always
used to give me a nice hug

03:24.160 --> 03:26.080
when she dropped me off at school.

03:26.080 --> 03:29.840
And a note saying,
"Have a successful term."

03:29.840 --> 03:31.920
I'm normally great with mums.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.440
It's a shame you were late.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.240
Well, I can't do half
a Caesarean, can I?

03:35.240 --> 03:36.800
I know. It's just...
it wasn't quite,

03:36.800 --> 03:38.440
"We'll tell her over a nice dinner,"
was it?

03:38.440 --> 03:41.760
Oh, she's known ever since she
caught me wanking off to He-Man.

03:41.760 --> 03:43.760
Look on the bright side.
You're never gonna

03:43.760 --> 03:46.160
have to sit next to her
at the top table now, are you?

03:46.160 --> 03:48.160
I never said never.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.360
Didn't say yes, though, either,
did you?

03:49.360 --> 03:53.160
No, I said that... You know
what I said. And you agreed.

03:56.320 --> 03:59.240
Do you wanna grab a drink?
How about ten?

03:59.240 --> 04:00.920
Why don't you have another go?

04:00.920 --> 04:04.040
Because...  Give her a call
and take her out for dinner.

04:04.040 --> 04:07.400
..you would have to prise my cold
dead hands from the phone.

04:07.400 --> 04:08.960
For me?

04:10.400 --> 04:12.760
She's not gonna be able to do
this week anyway.

04:12.760 --> 04:14.480
It's a full moon.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.040
HE HOWLS

04:25.280 --> 04:27.760
WHISPERS: That's it.

04:27.760 --> 04:28.960
Nice big breaths.

04:30.760 --> 04:34.120
Did you know that if you
spread out the surface area

04:34.120 --> 04:37.520
of your lungs and put them
on a football pitch...

04:39.600 --> 04:42.200
..that's an instant red card
and a direct free kick?

04:53.600 --> 04:56.200
Don't listen to anything
your mum says, by the way.

04:57.960 --> 05:00.080
She's just a bit upset with me.

05:02.960 --> 05:04.760
So's my mum, actually.

05:06.960 --> 05:08.800
Maybe it's a mum thing.

05:11.360 --> 05:12.920
Oh, and Harry is, too.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.000
Maybe it's a...a people thing.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.040
BACKGROUND CHATTER

05:37.960 --> 05:41.360
Hi!  Oh!  Oh, God, sorry.

05:41.360 --> 05:42.400
Fuck's sake.

05:43.520 --> 05:45.160
Is that your statement?

05:45.160 --> 05:46.720
Not even started mine yet.

05:46.720 --> 05:50.600
Well, I've only managed seven words
and a coffee stain.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.040
Get me a latte.

05:52.040 --> 05:53.280
Bring it up to labour ward.

05:55.320 --> 05:56.680
Please.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.040
Tell me you don't have to
work with that twat.

06:04.040 --> 06:05.600
Er, who, Adam?

06:05.600 --> 06:08.160
Oh, er, no, he's all right, really.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.400
Shit, sorry.

06:09.400 --> 06:12.160
I didn't mean to be rude
about your friend.

06:12.160 --> 06:14.000
I was trying to...

06:14.000 --> 06:15.800
I'm Ben.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.200
That's my name. Obviously.

06:18.200 --> 06:21.000
Er, Shruti.  I know. I mean...

06:21.000 --> 06:22.520
Do you like eating pizza?

06:23.800 --> 06:25.600
That sounds like I'm saying
you're fat.

06:25.600 --> 06:26.800
I don't think you're fat.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.520
I think you're not fat. I...

06:28.520 --> 06:31.360
I think I'm gonna
just start again. I'm Ben.

06:31.360 --> 06:34.800
Would you like to go
for something to eat,

06:34.800 --> 06:36.560
for example, a pizza?

06:36.560 --> 06:39.600
Er, yeah, that sounds nice.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.200
Great.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.640
Er, when? Like, tonight?

06:43.640 --> 06:45.520
Oh, er...  Tomorrow?

06:46.560 --> 06:47.600
Saturday?

06:49.120 --> 06:50.200
March?

06:50.200 --> 06:54.240
Er, tomorrow. Tomorrow...
Tomorrow could work.

06:56.080 --> 06:58.760
But it's just us three, right?
Like, you, me and Adam?

07:00.960 --> 07:02.840
BEN LAUGHS

07:04.480 --> 07:08.000
I'll meet you round
the front, like seven...ish?

07:08.000 --> 07:09.560
Yep.

07:13.800 --> 07:17.600
Er, Beatrice, you're
in Room Two. Second baby.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.400
Apparently she's
Jason Orange's cousin.

07:19.400 --> 07:20.680
ALL:  Ooh!

07:20.680 --> 07:22.640
Do with that knowledge as you will.

07:22.640 --> 07:24.200
Room Three is to remain empty

07:24.200 --> 07:26.680
for the next 24 hours, I'm afraid.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.560
The only good room?
Yeah, so no water births.

07:28.560 --> 07:30.760
The Secretary of State
for God knows what

07:30.760 --> 07:33.440
is coming around tomorrow,
so I'm assuming that

07:33.440 --> 07:34.560
we all wanna keep our jobs.

07:34.560 --> 07:37.240
They must think the entire NHS
smells like fresh paint.

07:37.240 --> 07:39.400
Still, new computer.

07:39.400 --> 07:42.240
It's been years since I've been able
to type words with G in it.

07:42.240 --> 07:43.400
LAUGHTER

07:43.400 --> 07:45.040
I wouldn't get too attached, love.

07:45.040 --> 07:47.840
Once the right honourable bastard
has done his little tour,

07:47.840 --> 07:50.800
that'll all be gone faster than
they can say "A&E closure".

07:52.960 --> 07:55.360
Right, who fancies twins?

07:59.200 --> 08:01.200
DRILL WHIRS

08:07.960 --> 08:09.160
I know I can count on you

08:09.160 --> 08:11.120
to keep everything perfect.
Yes, Nigel.

08:11.120 --> 08:13.480
And you're going to keep
Room Three free?

08:13.480 --> 08:15.840
Look, if the patients
don't need it, Nigel.

08:15.840 --> 08:17.920
Ah, Kay, bit of good news for you.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.280
They've dropped the complaint?

08:19.280 --> 08:21.960
Ministerial visit tomorrow,
and you get to shake his hand.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.640
That explains why we've got
the hospital's only mop today.

08:24.640 --> 08:26.280
Yeah, shouldn't be too taxing.

08:26.280 --> 08:29.440
Wander round the ward smiling
like a gay proctologist,

08:29.440 --> 08:32.200
then tell a quick,
charming anecdote,

08:32.200 --> 08:34.280
and it's off to the meeting room

08:34.280 --> 08:36.520
for a plate of Sainsbury's
cheapest sandwiches. You on?

08:36.520 --> 08:38.160
It would be my honour.  Good man.

08:38.160 --> 08:40.360
ALARM BLARES Right. 24 hours

08:40.360 --> 08:41.920
to make this place look like
a labour ward.

08:41.920 --> 08:43.280
ALARM CONTINUES

08:43.280 --> 08:45.920
Ah, traditionally at this point,

08:45.920 --> 08:48.600
a couple of you would be running
to the emergency.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.560
Oh, we usually wait a bit.
It's faulty.

08:50.560 --> 08:52.440
It randomly goes off
for a couple of seconds.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.400
If it keeps going, we'll run.
But normally it just...

08:54.400 --> 08:56.360
ALARM STOPS ..stops.

08:56.360 --> 08:57.840
How often does this happen?

08:57.840 --> 09:00.400
Er, couple of times an hour.
Well, add that to the list.

09:00.400 --> 09:01.880
Of course.
And what would you like me

09:01.880 --> 09:03.280
to take off the list to make time?

09:04.520 --> 09:05.760
Right.

09:05.760 --> 09:07.320
I'm on it. PAGER BEEPS

09:13.120 --> 09:14.480
What's wrong with her, then?

09:14.480 --> 09:15.600
I couldn't tell you.

09:15.600 --> 09:18.000
Is there someone who could?
She's obviously in pain,

09:18.000 --> 09:19.680
but she won't let us look.

09:19.680 --> 09:23.040
She's being...obstructive.

09:23.040 --> 09:26.760
Meaning?  Meaning she told me to fuck
off in four different languages.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.320
Sounds like she's OK to me.

09:31.640 --> 09:33.040
Oh...

09:35.360 --> 09:38.800
It is not sehr gut news, I'm afraid.

09:38.800 --> 09:43.680
Oh, dear.  I am afraid ze whole leg
will have to be cut off.

09:43.680 --> 09:45.280
Oh! I've just ordered
new slippers.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.920
Oh, no.  Will it grow back?

09:47.920 --> 09:50.560
No.  I don't think it will.

09:50.560 --> 09:54.320
Er, Petr, would you mind
escorting Professor Einstein

09:54.320 --> 09:56.640
back to her laboratory?

09:59.440 --> 10:02.480
Any chance you know
which ward you're on?

10:02.480 --> 10:04.880
Sorry if that
lady was bothering you.

10:04.880 --> 10:05.920
Are you kidding?

10:05.920 --> 10:09.920
She's the best doctor I've seen
since I've been in here.

10:09.920 --> 10:12.840
Is there, er, anything the matter?

10:12.840 --> 10:15.360
Oh, no,
just here for delicious food.

10:15.360 --> 10:17.160
HE LAUGHS How soundproof

10:17.160 --> 10:18.560
do you think that thing is?

10:18.560 --> 10:21.640
So how can I help you today,
Mrs Winnicka?

10:23.000 --> 10:26.120
I think something coming out.

10:26.120 --> 10:27.480
Of there.

10:27.480 --> 10:29.440
I hope not - labour ward's full.

10:29.440 --> 10:32.200
Er, do you mind if I have
a quick look?

10:32.200 --> 10:35.160
Bend your legs, feet together,
drop your knees to the side.

10:37.960 --> 10:39.800
Well, get on with it.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.480
HE CLEARS THROAT

10:47.640 --> 10:49.240
OK.

10:49.240 --> 10:50.440
Nothing to panic about -

10:50.440 --> 10:52.320
you've got a bit of
a prolapse there.

10:52.320 --> 10:54.760
That's your uterus you can feel
coming out.

10:54.760 --> 10:55.920
Oh!  Very common.

10:55.920 --> 10:59.400
There's something we can put inside
to sort of...

10:59.400 --> 11:00.880
..hold it all up there.

11:00.880 --> 11:03.600
Haven't had anything up there
since decimalisation.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.360
I'll get you booked into
urogynae clinic

11:05.360 --> 11:06.640
in the next few days.

11:08.360 --> 11:09.560
Tell you what.

11:10.760 --> 11:13.200
I'll get everything I need
from clinic

11:13.200 --> 11:14.720
and pop back up with it later.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.920
Go on, then, what you waiting for?

11:24.040 --> 11:26.680
Well, everything looks
absolutely fine.

11:26.680 --> 11:29.560
If the tummy pain's settled, then I think we can....

11:29.560 --> 11:30.720
Mummy's having a conversation.

11:30.720 --> 11:32.480
Why don't we look at your book
for a bit?

11:32.480 --> 11:34.920
Oh, well, like I was saying,
if the tummy pain has settled,

11:34.920 --> 11:36.680
then I think we can probably
get you back home.

11:36.680 --> 11:39.720
If you're sure.  If anything changes,
just come back in and see us.

11:39.720 --> 11:42.840
I mean, we are never closed.
Unfortunately.

11:42.840 --> 11:45.040
DAD:  Stop. CHILD GIGGLES

11:45.040 --> 11:46.120
Stop.

11:48.640 --> 11:51.920
Stop it.  Would you guys just, like,
hang on one minute, please?

11:51.920 --> 11:54.720
ALARM BLARES My lady in One is absolutely

11:54.720 --> 11:55.960
desperate for a water birth.

11:55.960 --> 11:58.160
Any chance we can get her
into Room Three?

11:58.160 --> 12:00.360
I'm really sorry,
but it's above my pay grade.

12:00.360 --> 12:03.120
Lockhart needs it empty so we can
show it off to the Minister.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.720
OK, well, I've asked.

12:04.720 --> 12:07.000
Don't you think that they should see
what this place

12:07.000 --> 12:09.560
is really like, rather than some
Sellotaped-together version?

12:09.560 --> 12:12.280
Good plan. And when they sack me,
you gonna pay my mortgage

12:12.280 --> 12:14.200
directly into the bank
or just give me the cash?

12:14.200 --> 12:16.760
RIA:  You'd think they'd have picked
a quieter time to come.

12:16.760 --> 12:19.440
Sorry to bother you. But...
And yet here you are.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.200
So someone came in
with nothing the matter

12:27.200 --> 12:28.560
and you sent them home?

12:28.560 --> 12:30.640
No, but...  I'm sorry,
I'm quite busy right now.

12:30.640 --> 12:32.680
I probably can't arrange
a full parade in your honour.

12:32.680 --> 12:35.000
No, look. The stickers on her file.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.440
Oh, shit.  That's a domestic abuse
alert, right?

12:37.440 --> 12:39.160
In the ladies' toilets
there are red stickers

12:39.160 --> 12:40.320
that you put on your notes

12:40.320 --> 12:42.280
if you wanna talk privately
about domestic abuse.

12:42.280 --> 12:43.560
Good spot.

12:43.560 --> 12:45.040
Parade's back on.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.600
Hi! I'm Adam, one of the doctors.

12:48.600 --> 12:49.960
Everything OK?

12:49.960 --> 12:51.280
Nothing to worry about.

12:52.360 --> 12:54.920
Just wondering if I could have
a couple of words with you

12:54.920 --> 12:58.400
in private?  Ah, we want to stay with
Mummy, don't we, Ernie?

12:58.400 --> 13:01.280
Well, I do have to examine your wife
in quite a personal way.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.800
I thought you said it was
a couple of words.

13:02.800 --> 13:05.880
Yeah, the words are "vaginal"
and "examination",

13:05.880 --> 13:07.560
and I thought with your son here...
OK.

13:07.560 --> 13:10.160
..it might be better...  You'll be
all right, darling?  Yeah.

13:10.160 --> 13:12.040
There's a coffee shop downstairs.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.400
Well, I think the Caffe Nero
opposite's probably safer.

13:15.440 --> 13:17.720
Go! Zoom!  Zoom!

13:21.160 --> 13:23.240
Is everything OK at home, Anna?

13:23.240 --> 13:24.800
SHE LAUGHS How do you mean?

13:24.800 --> 13:25.880
Anna, you can tell us.

13:25.880 --> 13:28.480
I mean, you've done the hard
bit already.

13:28.480 --> 13:30.160
Er, the stickers?

13:30.160 --> 13:32.080
ERNIE:  Stickers!

13:32.080 --> 13:33.120
Oh, God.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.160
He's always doing this
sort of thing.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.680
ERNIE:  Sticky stickers!

13:37.680 --> 13:39.320
ANNA:  He loves stickers.
DAD:  Ernie?

13:39.320 --> 13:41.720
Ernie!
ERNIE:  Sticky stickers.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.520
So sorry.

13:43.520 --> 13:46.000
Come on, then, Miss Marple.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.480
DAD:  Oh! Rascal.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.440
ALARM BLARES

13:51.440 --> 13:53.000
WOMAN:  False alarm, everyone.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.120
There was something weird
about him.

13:55.120 --> 13:56.560
Yeah.

13:56.560 --> 13:57.960
He was a posh twat.

13:57.960 --> 14:00.160
But you don't get arrested
for that.

14:00.160 --> 14:02.200
SHE SCOFFS Just as well.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.480
Me? You can talk.

14:04.480 --> 14:07.600
My mum's a dinner lady
and my dad's an electrician.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.960
Well, where did I get the idea
that your parents were doctors?

14:09.960 --> 14:12.240
Ooh, er,
from racist stereotypes?

14:12.240 --> 14:13.680
Um, no!

14:13.680 --> 14:15.560
No, no, no. Um...

14:15.560 --> 14:18.200
You...  I'm kidding.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.760
You do know that, like,

14:19.760 --> 14:22.040
not everyone gets this handed
to them on a plate, right?

14:22.040 --> 14:24.040
Like, it didn't even occur to
my parents

14:24.040 --> 14:25.680
that I could end up being a doctor.

14:25.680 --> 14:27.440
All right, Little Orphan Annie.

14:27.440 --> 14:29.280
How did you end up here, then?

14:31.120 --> 14:32.200
HE SPLUTTERS

14:32.200 --> 14:35.000
Er, my...
Well, my dad was a doctor, and...

14:35.000 --> 14:36.640
And he had this big plate?

14:42.760 --> 14:44.320
DAD:  No, I won't calm down, Anna.

14:44.320 --> 14:46.320
What the hell did you think
this was gonna achieve?

14:48.080 --> 14:49.680
SHRUTI:  Sorry, sorry...

14:49.680 --> 14:52.440
I, er... Er, glad I...
Glad I caught you.

14:53.920 --> 14:56.480
Er, I was just discussing
your case a bit more

14:56.480 --> 14:59.360
with my colleague and we thought
that it'd be best

14:59.360 --> 15:01.120
to keep you in overnight.
For a test.

15:01.120 --> 15:02.920
Er, what sort of test?

15:02.920 --> 15:05.400
A...a scan test.  So a scan?

15:05.400 --> 15:07.480
Yes, yes, exactly.
ANNA:  What's wrong?

15:07.480 --> 15:08.680
Is something wrong with the baby?

15:08.680 --> 15:10.440
Oh, no, I...
I'm sure everything's fine,

15:10.440 --> 15:12.160
I just wanna check
the baby's growing properly.

15:12.160 --> 15:13.480
And you can't do it today?

15:13.480 --> 15:15.720
Er, well, there actually
aren't any slots till morning,

15:15.720 --> 15:18.040
er, so if we just... Just to be
on the safe side, probably best

15:18.040 --> 15:19.680
to stay in overnight.
DAD:  That's fine.

15:19.680 --> 15:21.360
I'll keep her company
till visiting hours end.

15:21.360 --> 15:22.880
Is your phone charged?  Yep.

15:25.640 --> 15:28.600
ADAM: It's going off every
three minutes.

15:28.600 --> 15:33.080
No, I don't have the error code
for the secondary console.

15:33.080 --> 15:34.960
BEEP

15:34.960 --> 15:37.600
I don't even know what
a secondary console is.

15:37.600 --> 15:43.360
Listen, I need someone
to come here with a tool box,

15:43.360 --> 15:46.600
a jumpsuit, and the phrase
"I have fixed the alarm."

15:48.000 --> 15:49.680
What?

15:49.680 --> 15:51.960
Three weeks?!

15:51.960 --> 15:54.920
Which of Neptune's moons
are you based on, exactly?

15:54.920 --> 15:56.520
Listen, forget it.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.640
Pleasure doing business with you.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.160
Er, can I help you?

16:08.160 --> 16:10.400
Er, I'm starting
an Ultimate Frisbee team.

16:10.400 --> 16:11.720
Do you want in?

16:16.920 --> 16:18.680
ALARM BLARES

16:21.920 --> 16:23.160
Hi.

16:23.160 --> 16:24.320
Sorry, hi.

16:24.320 --> 16:25.560
Are you working on labour ward?

16:25.560 --> 16:27.680
Yeah.  Can you see if you can do
anything

16:27.680 --> 16:29.840
to stop the alarm going off
every three seconds?

16:29.840 --> 16:31.200
I'll have a go.

16:31.200 --> 16:32.760
Can you have a success?

16:32.760 --> 16:34.440
ALARM CONTINUES

16:41.280 --> 16:42.640
OK.

16:45.760 --> 16:48.880
Just... Just try to relax.

16:48.880 --> 16:50.920
Oh, it's easy for you to say.

16:53.160 --> 16:54.960
Went to the theatre last night.

16:54.960 --> 16:56.760
Oh, how thrilling for you.  In a way.

16:56.760 --> 16:58.680
Had a massive argument
with my mother.

16:58.680 --> 17:01.440
Yes, and have you apologised yet?

17:01.440 --> 17:04.200
Didn't do anything wrong.
She's your mother.

17:04.200 --> 17:05.800
She could be dead tomorrow.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.600
I'll apologise in my eulogy, then.

17:09.600 --> 17:11.720
Yep, there it is, all done.

17:15.280 --> 17:17.160
How's that feel?

17:17.160 --> 17:18.680
Better?

17:18.680 --> 17:20.000
Better.

17:21.400 --> 17:22.640
That's good.

17:25.080 --> 17:28.280
Right, I will get you booked
into clinic

17:28.280 --> 17:30.360
to have it replaced in six months.

17:30.360 --> 17:32.200
Will you be doing it?

17:32.200 --> 17:33.600
Ah, it sort of depends on...

17:34.880 --> 17:37.640
Yeah. Sure.  That's a shame.

17:49.200 --> 17:51.360
Just because it's only got
one Michelin star

17:51.360 --> 17:53.080
doesn't mean it's not
a good restaurant, Mum.

17:53.080 --> 17:56.520
Well, how on Earth am I meant to
know how hygienic the kitchen is?

17:56.520 --> 17:58.400
SHRUTI:  Ria, who's the
safeguarding midwife?

17:58.400 --> 18:00.640
RIA:  Oh, it used to be
Paulette, but she left.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.840
Thank God. If it's urgent,
you can speak to Tracy.

18:02.840 --> 18:04.440
OK, yep, see you at eight.

18:04.440 --> 18:05.720
Bye. MUM HANGS UP

18:05.720 --> 18:07.560
Don't forget to charge
your broomstick.

18:07.560 --> 18:08.840
SHRUTI:  Adam, where's Tracy?

18:10.160 --> 18:11.720
Dunno. Busy getting her MBE?

18:11.720 --> 18:13.600
CRASH, PAINED YELLING

18:17.400 --> 18:19.800
Jesus Christ.
What's happened here?

18:19.800 --> 18:22.760
I'll tell you in a minute.
Can you just check her CTG?

18:22.760 --> 18:25.840
First baby,
41 but otherwise low risk.

18:25.840 --> 18:27.240
What happened in there?

18:27.240 --> 18:28.960
Oh, my God.

18:28.960 --> 18:30.480
Jesus.

18:30.480 --> 18:31.640
Hi, I'm Adam.

18:31.640 --> 18:33.200
One of the doctors.
I was supposed to be

18:33.200 --> 18:34.280
having a water birth.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.640
You never know - one of the pipes
might come down.

18:36.640 --> 18:40.000
Baby's heart rate's improving
nicely. So sorry. We'll, er,

18:40.000 --> 18:42.120
we'll, er, we'll get you
somewhere, another room.

18:42.120 --> 18:45.160
No, we don't have another room,
so...  What?

18:45.160 --> 18:47.560
..we'll just clear this one up. OK?

18:49.200 --> 18:50.280
She's the boss.

18:54.640 --> 18:55.880
What happened in there?

18:55.880 --> 18:58.520
I'll tell you what didn't happen -
the bloody alarm.

18:58.520 --> 19:00.320
I pulled it twice, and nothing,

19:00.320 --> 19:02.440
so I put a bit more welly into it...

19:02.440 --> 19:04.600
What did you do?  Nothing.

19:04.600 --> 19:06.320
Don't bullshit me.

19:06.320 --> 19:07.360
Well, the...

19:08.520 --> 19:11.200
..the alarm company couldn't
send anyone for three weeks

19:11.200 --> 19:13.720
so I asked a workman to...

19:13.720 --> 19:14.960
..have a go.

19:14.960 --> 19:17.040
And how would you say they did,
out of ten?

19:22.600 --> 19:24.200
SHE SIGHS Fuck this.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.880
Good news.
We've found you another room.

19:28.880 --> 19:30.440
There's even a pool in there
for water birth.

19:30.440 --> 19:33.640
And can I still eat my placenta?
Sure, why not?

19:38.080 --> 19:39.600
Dr Adam!

19:47.400 --> 19:48.640
How's my little friend?

19:48.640 --> 19:51.000
Oh, you know, just keeping busy.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.760
Cleaned the oven this morning,
then I came down here.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.080
Er, can I ask
what you're doing here?

19:56.080 --> 19:58.240
Sorry, we, er, we did meet
before but it was...

19:58.240 --> 20:00.480
Yeah, it was only briefly.
Er, I'm the doctor

20:00.480 --> 20:03.000
who delivered your nephew.
I know exactly who you are.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.320
That's why I'm asking

20:04.320 --> 20:08.600
if it's appropriate for you
to be here right now.

20:08.600 --> 20:10.280
Um...sorry, yeah, of course.

20:10.280 --> 20:12.520
I was just going.  Yeah.

20:12.520 --> 20:14.000
ERIKA:  Bye, Dr Adam!

20:36.160 --> 20:38.160
HARRY:  'Go on, then,
what's the damage?'

20:38.160 --> 20:40.320
Er, 10? 11? HE SIGHS

20:40.320 --> 20:42.320
You remember you said
you'd go through my presentation

20:42.320 --> 20:44.400
when you got home?
Do you remember how

20:44.400 --> 20:46.560
you wanted me to meet my mum
for dinner?

20:46.560 --> 20:49.640
Amazing! Well, good luck.

20:49.640 --> 20:52.640
Let me know how it goes, yeah?
Mm.

20:52.640 --> 20:54.360
And remember the magic words.

20:54.360 --> 20:57.000
If she tries to suck out my soul,
I say, "Expecto Patronum".

20:57.000 --> 20:59.560
I was thinking, "I'm sorry".

20:59.560 --> 21:00.920
Good luck.

21:05.520 --> 21:07.760
Oh, thank you,
you've remembered us at last.

21:07.760 --> 21:11.320
I hope it is to your satisfaction
this time.  Are those chives?

21:13.560 --> 21:17.000
And get him a new one,
too, that's gone stone-cold.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.480
Of course, madam.

21:19.480 --> 21:22.960
If you could maybe only spit
in hers?

21:22.960 --> 21:25.560
I can't remember the last time
I saw you two months in a row,

21:25.560 --> 21:27.200
let alone two evenings.

21:27.200 --> 21:28.760
How's work?

21:28.760 --> 21:30.480
Er, yeah, work's...

21:30.480 --> 21:31.760
..fine, yes.

21:33.280 --> 21:35.560
I'm acting registrar now -
did I mention that?

21:35.560 --> 21:37.440
Yes, it's wonderful news.

21:37.440 --> 21:40.320
Your father and I are very proud.

21:40.320 --> 21:42.720
Lesley's son's a professor.

21:42.720 --> 21:44.920
L... Lesley's son's 50.

21:44.920 --> 21:46.480
He said, she said.

21:46.480 --> 21:49.800
Anyway, I'm showing a minister round
the ward tomorrow.

21:49.800 --> 21:51.960
Oh, that's fantastic, darling.

21:51.960 --> 21:54.040
How many doctors
were they choosing from?

21:54.040 --> 21:57.000
Quite a lot, actually.
Hundreds, I expect.

22:00.680 --> 22:04.680
Um, so yesterday, at the...

22:04.680 --> 22:05.880
..at the theatre...

22:07.400 --> 22:10.080
..we didn't really get
the chance to speak properly.

22:10.080 --> 22:12.240
Well, you weren't there
for half of it.

22:12.240 --> 22:15.640
I said something pretty important to
you when I arrived.

22:15.640 --> 22:19.520
When you finally arrived.  What I'm
saying is I want to apologise to you

22:19.520 --> 22:22.080
for not saying it in the best way.

22:22.080 --> 22:24.840
But, er, it's important to me.

22:26.480 --> 22:27.920
He's important to me.

22:27.920 --> 22:29.720
When's Gregory's wedding?

22:29.720 --> 22:31.960
I really like the girl
he's marrying, don't you?

22:31.960 --> 22:34.880
She's very charming.  I'm talking to
you about Harry, though,

22:34.880 --> 22:36.920
aren't I, Mum? Not Greg.

22:36.920 --> 22:39.600
I'm saying to you
that I live with Harry.

22:39.600 --> 22:41.360
And we only have one bedroom.

22:42.600 --> 22:44.880
Do you want a deposit
on a bigger flat?

22:44.880 --> 22:46.560
Is that what all this is about?

22:46.560 --> 22:49.080
I'm saying to you,
I live with Harry,

22:49.080 --> 22:52.440
I'm very happy, and we love each
other, and we're gay.

22:52.440 --> 22:54.320
Both of you?

22:54.320 --> 22:55.600
HE LAUGHS

22:56.960 --> 22:58.480
Yes, both of...

22:58.480 --> 23:00.800
What was wrong with Helen?

23:00.800 --> 23:02.360
You were so nice together.

23:02.360 --> 23:05.480
I'm gay, Mum.  Look. I've watched you
pull your pants down

23:05.480 --> 23:07.480
at far too many
children's birthday parties

23:07.480 --> 23:09.240
to be fazed by one of your
outbursts.

23:09.240 --> 23:11.040
This is not an outburst.

23:12.520 --> 23:13.560
Thank you.

23:15.800 --> 23:16.960
Thank you.

23:22.760 --> 23:25.600
I don't know what you're
getting so uppity about.

23:25.600 --> 23:28.080
I said to your father he seemed...

23:28.080 --> 23:31.440
..fairly nice.
He is nice. He's very nice.

23:32.760 --> 23:36.680
Did I tell you Monica's having
her kitchen redone again?

23:36.680 --> 23:38.240
Glass everywhere.

23:38.240 --> 23:39.800
Looks awful.

23:39.800 --> 23:42.400
Anyway, we're engaged.

23:44.080 --> 23:45.320
We're getting married.

24:16.760 --> 24:19.000
HARRY:  So, how'd it go, then?
Yeah, fine.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.520
She didn't kill you, then.
That's something.  Yeah...

24:21.520 --> 24:23.240
Yeah, she got it.

24:23.240 --> 24:25.520
See? I knew she would,
if you just apologised

24:25.520 --> 24:26.880
for springing it on her.

24:30.880 --> 24:34.080
So, um...what did she say?

24:34.080 --> 24:36.680
Oh, you know, she mainly
talked about herself.

24:36.680 --> 24:39.400
But she was, er...

24:39.400 --> 24:41.120
..interested in you.

24:41.120 --> 24:44.040
And, er, yeah,
asked lots of questions.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.560
Like what?

24:47.560 --> 24:49.240
About your job,

24:49.240 --> 24:50.960
and about your family.

24:52.200 --> 24:54.920
And she said she can't wait
to meet you properly,

24:54.920 --> 24:57.400
next time she's in London,
stealing Dalmatians.

24:57.400 --> 24:58.960
I knew she'd be happy if you

24:58.960 --> 25:00.920
were just straight with her.
I think she'd be happier

25:00.920 --> 25:02.160
if I was straight full stop.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.640
Well, why don't we arrange
for us to all meet up again?

25:04.640 --> 25:05.960
I'm knackered,
I should probably...

25:05.960 --> 25:07.640
Or we can ask her over for dinner.

25:07.640 --> 25:09.520
I can make...fajitas?

25:09.520 --> 25:13.000
Does she like fajitas? I mean,
who doesn't love fajitas?

25:13.000 --> 25:14.800
And I make amazing fajitas.  Harry...

25:14.800 --> 25:16.120
These really good...

25:25.600 --> 25:28.480
# Let's dance

25:30.200 --> 25:35.360
# Put on your red shoes
and dance the blues

25:37.600 --> 25:39.720
# Let's dance

25:40.800 --> 25:46.120
# To the song they're
playing on the radio

25:49.480 --> 25:51.440
# Let's sway

25:53.560 --> 25:57.560
# While colour lights up your face

26:01.600 --> 26:04.600
# Let's sway

26:04.600 --> 26:10.480
# Sway through the crowd
to an empty space

26:15.720 --> 26:19.760
# And if you say run

26:19.760 --> 26:22.960
# I'll run with you

26:26.960 --> 26:31.080
# And if you say hide

26:31.080 --> 26:34.200
# We'll hide

26:37.120 --> 26:40.880
# Because my love for you... #

26:42.480 --> 26:45.680
WHISPERS:  Anna?

26:45.680 --> 26:47.920
Anna?

26:47.920 --> 26:49.680
SHE CLEARS THROAT

26:49.680 --> 26:51.200
Anna!

26:51.200 --> 26:55.520
# If you should fall
into my arms... #

26:55.520 --> 26:56.720
Anna...

26:56.720 --> 26:58.160
ANNA GASPS My God.

26:59.200 --> 27:00.360
God.

27:01.560 --> 27:03.160
Oh, God, I'm so sorry,
did I wake you?

27:03.160 --> 27:04.680
I know the answer's yes.

27:04.680 --> 27:06.200
I totally woke you up.
I'm so sorry.

27:06.200 --> 27:07.720
What's going on?

27:07.720 --> 27:10.320
Er, I just wanted, er,
to talk to you.

27:10.320 --> 27:11.760
In the middle of the night?

27:12.880 --> 27:14.920
I thought you might wanna
have a chat?

27:14.920 --> 27:17.600
And there's no-one else
you can have a chat with?

27:17.600 --> 27:20.400
Wait here just one, one second,
just give me one second.

27:29.840 --> 27:31.760
Do your scan now, shall we, yeah?

27:36.920 --> 27:39.080
Just watch out...just watch out for
that.

27:39.080 --> 27:40.480
Ooh!  Bit cold, sorry.

27:48.480 --> 27:50.800
Do you know
if it's a boy or a girl?

27:50.800 --> 27:52.440
They said she's a girl.

27:52.440 --> 27:53.520
Yeah, I agree.

27:53.520 --> 27:55.440
That's her heart... HEARTBEAT POUNDS

27:55.440 --> 27:57.400
..beating away there.
That all looks good.

27:59.280 --> 28:02.040
You know, it's really a weird
job being an obstetrician.

28:03.600 --> 28:06.640
Cos you always look after
two separate patients at once.

28:06.640 --> 28:08.240
BEEP

28:14.120 --> 28:15.240
It's...

28:16.280 --> 28:18.600
It's just since I've been pregnant.

28:21.120 --> 28:22.880
It's not his fault.
He's not a bad man.

28:22.880 --> 28:25.360
What's changed
since you've been pregnant?

28:25.360 --> 28:28.760
SHE SIGHS Ernie can be a real handful,

28:28.760 --> 28:31.240
and his work's so stressful
at the moment.

28:34.160 --> 28:35.680
He didn't mean to.

28:35.680 --> 28:37.280
Anna, will you let me help you?

28:59.320 --> 29:01.040
What's that?

29:01.040 --> 29:03.800
Nothing interesting,
just a work form.

29:08.640 --> 29:10.280
This suit too tatty?

29:10.280 --> 29:11.320
Be honest.

29:12.680 --> 29:14.080
If anything, it's impressive

29:14.080 --> 29:16.560
you've managed to keep
your school uniform so neat.

29:16.560 --> 29:18.640
Where's the one you wore
to Hannah's wedding?

29:18.640 --> 29:21.160
Is that the wedding where we swam in
the pond?  Yeah.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.360
In the pond.

29:22.360 --> 29:24.440
Well, you look very handsome,

29:24.440 --> 29:26.760
in your suit with your shoes,
and that little bit

29:26.760 --> 29:28.520
of beard you've left on your cheek.

29:35.280 --> 29:36.520
Oh, Jeez.

29:38.960 --> 29:40.120
HARRY:  Oh, hey!

29:40.120 --> 29:42.280
No, no, it's Harry.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.680
No, no, he's just in the...the
bathroom,

29:44.680 --> 29:45.880
he'll be out in a sec.

29:45.880 --> 29:48.800
Sorry we didn't get to chat
much at the theatre.

29:48.800 --> 29:50.480
Ha, thank you.

29:50.480 --> 29:51.880
Congratulations for?

29:51.880 --> 29:53.240
Oh, right.

29:53.240 --> 29:54.800
Yes, of course. Silly me. Er...

29:54.800 --> 29:57.600
I can...  He's just here now.
I'll pass you over.

29:58.960 --> 30:00.440
It's your mum.

30:05.360 --> 30:06.480
Hi, Mum.

30:08.280 --> 30:10.080
Mum, the signal is bad.

30:10.080 --> 30:12.080
I'll call you back later.

30:13.920 --> 30:14.960
OK, bye.

30:19.120 --> 30:20.760
I told her that we were engaged.

30:20.760 --> 30:22.440
Yeah, I worked that bit out.

30:23.560 --> 30:26.240
This better be
a fucking amazing explanation.

30:26.240 --> 30:28.040
You don't know her.  I'm starting to
think I don't know you.

30:28.040 --> 30:30.160
It was... It was the only thing
I could think to say to...

30:31.600 --> 30:33.040
..make her take us seriously.

30:33.040 --> 30:35.600
Well, wouldn't it be a good start
if you took us seriously?

30:35.600 --> 30:38.400
HE LAUGHS I proposed. That's serious.

30:38.400 --> 30:40.320
Yeah, and what did I say? Hm?

30:40.320 --> 30:42.520
Let me in. Let me know
what's going on in there.

30:42.520 --> 30:44.080
"How was your day?" "Fine, thanks."

30:44.080 --> 30:45.280
"How was your day?" "Fine, thanks."

30:45.280 --> 30:46.720
"How was your day?" "Fine, thanks."

30:46.720 --> 30:49.040
I knew it was a terrible idea
coming out to her.

30:50.280 --> 30:51.560
How can you say that?

30:51.560 --> 30:53.280
Well, look what's happened.

30:55.640 --> 30:57.760
Come here.  Sorry.

30:57.760 --> 30:59.840
It's OK. Well done for telling her.

31:04.680 --> 31:08.080
Er, what's going on here?
Some wiring issue.

31:08.080 --> 31:10.560
How long's it gonna take?
How long's a piece of wire?

31:10.560 --> 31:12.160
Excuse me.

31:12.160 --> 31:14.960
I presume this will be tidied
away within the next hour?

31:14.960 --> 31:18.240
Jesus Christ. It's like downtown
Basra in here.

31:18.240 --> 31:20.320
I didn't think it would be possible

31:20.320 --> 31:21.640
to make the place look worse.

31:21.640 --> 31:23.440
We needed to stop
the alarm misfiring, so I...

31:23.440 --> 31:25.280
Threw a grenade at the ceiling?

31:25.280 --> 31:28.360
God, and don't let
the fire officer see that suit.

31:28.360 --> 31:31.120
The whole place could go up.
NURSE:  Can we get a doctor

31:31.120 --> 31:32.360
into Room Three, please?  Tracy!

31:32.360 --> 31:33.960
LOCKHART:  Clean that up.
The minister will be here...

31:35.280 --> 31:37.840
Hi, I'm Adam, one of the doctors.
We met yesterday.

31:37.840 --> 31:39.720
Straightforward water birth
three minutes ago,

31:39.720 --> 31:42.080
placenta not coming easily,
and now a bit of a bleed.

31:42.080 --> 31:45.400
Right. BABY CRIES

31:45.400 --> 31:47.480
OK, let's, er, pop you onto the bed

31:47.480 --> 31:50.360
so the doctor can have
a proper look. OK?

31:50.360 --> 31:53.000
Er, and I...
I can still eat my placenta

31:53.000 --> 31:55.520
after this, you're...you're not
gonna take it away?

31:55.520 --> 31:58.320
That's a question for the midwives,
not me, I'm afraid.

31:58.320 --> 32:00.440
Yeah, it's perfectly natural.

32:00.440 --> 32:01.760
Dogs do it.

32:03.040 --> 32:05.120
They also eat their young
and fuck the furniture.

32:05.120 --> 32:06.880
Don't worry, it won't take long.

32:06.880 --> 32:08.240
Is that pain relief OK?

32:09.600 --> 32:11.920
OK. Right, first things first,
let's see where

32:11.920 --> 32:13.360
this bleed is coming from.

32:13.360 --> 32:15.200
Yep, you've got a bit of
a tear here.

32:15.200 --> 32:17.800
Suture, needle-holder,
scissors, large swabs. Thanks.

32:20.160 --> 32:21.560
MUM CRIES

32:21.560 --> 32:23.080
I'll be two minutes.

32:23.080 --> 32:24.520
Just a quick bit of needlework.

32:27.280 --> 32:28.640
DAD:  Isn't she lovely?

32:28.640 --> 32:30.160
That's the bleeding stopped.

32:30.160 --> 32:33.760
TRACY:  We'll get her weighed,
as soon as Doctor's left.

32:33.760 --> 32:35.400
Now, delicious....

32:37.280 --> 32:39.000
..placenta. SQUELCHY SLAP

32:40.680 --> 32:42.120
Hang on. Isn't...?

32:42.120 --> 32:43.920
Isn't this...

32:43.920 --> 32:45.800
..the placenta?

32:46.920 --> 32:49.120
No, that's blood clots
from inside your...

32:50.520 --> 32:51.600
That's blood clots.

32:54.160 --> 32:56.800
SHE RETCHES, PAGER BUZZES

32:56.800 --> 32:58.800
'Crash call to gynae.
Crash call to gynae.'

32:58.800 --> 33:00.200
ALARM BLARES

33:01.840 --> 33:04.640
RESUS NURSE:  26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

33:04.640 --> 33:06.360
NURSE:  OK. I've got access.

33:06.360 --> 33:09.600
Er, can I help? I'm one of
the obs and gynae registrars.

33:09.600 --> 33:11.080
What do you know about her?

33:11.080 --> 33:13.200
Er, Magda Winnicka, 85 years old,

33:13.200 --> 33:16.000
long-stay stable vulval cancer
patient, awaiting discharge.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.840
Otherwise fit as a fiddle.
Well, she's not now, is she?

33:18.840 --> 33:22.040
PETR:  I'm so sorry, Doctor, I hadn't
checked the notes before.

33:22.040 --> 33:23.720
Oh, for God's sake.

33:23.720 --> 33:26.680
This patient has a valid
Do Not Resuscitate form.

33:26.680 --> 33:28.440
Is everybody happy to stop CPR now?

33:28.440 --> 33:30.400
No, come on,
we can give her a good shot.

33:30.400 --> 33:32.960
Resuscitation discontinued at 10:42.

33:32.960 --> 33:34.560
ADAM: She was absolutely fine
yesterday.

33:34.560 --> 33:36.120
I fitted her a pessary,

33:36.120 --> 33:38.520
she was up in bed, talking.
We're not going against

33:38.520 --> 33:40.960
a Do Not Resuscitate order
authorised by the patient.

33:40.960 --> 33:42.560
Are you happy to certify death?

33:47.200 --> 33:48.600
DOOR CLOSES

34:07.120 --> 34:08.960
I took my mum for dinner,
by the way.

34:13.560 --> 34:14.840
Total disaster.

34:18.720 --> 34:19.880
Mostly my fault.

34:21.800 --> 34:23.520
I told her I was getting married,

34:23.520 --> 34:25.920
which was a bit of a lie.

34:25.920 --> 34:28.000
I mean, I asked him, but he said no,

34:28.000 --> 34:29.560
which is fair enough, really.

34:34.880 --> 34:37.800
I always used to reckon
I was good at medicine and...

34:37.800 --> 34:39.600
..bad at the other stuff.

34:44.320 --> 34:46.160
Not doing great at either right now.

35:15.400 --> 35:17.480
PEN SCRATCHES

35:30.160 --> 35:31.720
Don't you dare haunt me.

35:38.400 --> 35:39.760
DOOR CLOSES

35:51.320 --> 35:52.920
Oh, yes, yes.

35:52.920 --> 35:56.520
I can see zat you will probably
be dead by...

35:56.520 --> 35:58.240
..Freitag.

35:58.240 --> 35:59.680
Zat one zere,

35:59.680 --> 36:03.000
she has the worse case
of worms I ever, ever seen.

36:04.840 --> 36:06.640
That's her bloody surname.

36:06.640 --> 36:08.120
Have another look.

36:08.120 --> 36:10.560
She's not on the antenatal ward.
They told me she's here.

36:10.560 --> 36:12.240
Just tell me what room she's in.

36:12.240 --> 36:15.440
RIA:  Of course,
if you'll give me a moment.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.000
Is this a joke?

36:23.400 --> 36:26.080
What am I meant to do?

36:26.080 --> 36:28.120
Anna, please don't
worry about it, OK?

36:28.120 --> 36:29.920
It's gonna be all right. DOOR OPENS

36:29.920 --> 36:32.680
So, er, OK, we're gonna
sort it out, all right?

36:32.680 --> 36:34.840
Sort what out?  Er...

36:34.840 --> 36:37.520
..we just need to run a few
more tests.

36:41.120 --> 36:42.640
How long is this gonna take?

36:42.640 --> 36:44.240
I'm sure it won't take long.

36:44.240 --> 36:46.600
Mr Hanson, actually,
I'd prefer if you could give us

36:46.600 --> 36:48.680
a few more minutes.  You need to
drop your attitude.

36:48.680 --> 36:50.920
Angus. Please.  She's had you in here
all night.

36:50.920 --> 36:53.320
She's fannying around, clearly
doesn't know what she's doing.

36:53.320 --> 36:55.760
Why don't I get someone else
to come in

36:55.760 --> 36:58.000
and do the scan, then, yeah?

37:02.280 --> 37:03.920
Just do your little tests,

37:03.920 --> 37:05.440
and we'll get home.

37:10.720 --> 37:13.000
LOCKHART:  Spit-spot, team,
they'll be here any moment.

37:14.160 --> 37:17.240
Ah. I guess pyjamas are probably
better than nylon and vomit.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.640
I had a patient die today.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.800
Someone...

37:29.800 --> 37:32.280
You know,
someone I really cared for.

37:32.280 --> 37:35.080
Well, you can't have cared for her
that well if she died.

37:36.760 --> 37:38.360
I thought I might go to her funeral.

37:38.360 --> 37:40.440
You're not going
to a patient's funeral.

37:40.440 --> 37:41.760
It's unprofessional.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.960
Did I say "go to her funeral"
or did I say

37:43.960 --> 37:45.440
"fuck her grandchildren"?

37:45.440 --> 37:46.800
Er...

37:48.440 --> 37:50.640
I don't want to be unprofessional,
I just wanna...

37:50.640 --> 37:53.160
..wanna make sure that there's,
er, a friendly face there.

37:53.160 --> 37:55.760
Oh, you gonna make some
balloon animals as well?

37:57.520 --> 38:00.240
We've got boundaries for a reason.

38:00.240 --> 38:03.720
Shit happens. You can't just
let yourself feel it all.

38:05.160 --> 38:07.000
RIA:  They're just leaving
the main building.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.320
Be with you in three minutes.

38:08.320 --> 38:09.720
LOCKHART:  Eyes right.

38:15.080 --> 38:16.960
How long is this gonna take?
I just wanna monitor

38:16.960 --> 38:18.720
the baby's heart for 15 minutes.

38:18.720 --> 38:21.640
Does it have to be that long?  Why
don't I put a Do Not Disturb sign

38:21.640 --> 38:23.640
on the door, just to stop anyone
coming in, cos the doors

38:23.640 --> 38:25.120
don't have locks here.

38:25.120 --> 38:26.160
Fine.

38:31.840 --> 38:33.880
ERNIE: Neeeowwww!

38:33.880 --> 38:35.880
Shut that child up.

38:35.880 --> 38:38.560
TEARFULLY:  Ernie, darling,
don't do that.

LOCKHART:  Kay! Get back here.

39:04.120 --> 39:05.680
Everything OK?

39:05.680 --> 39:09.400
Yeah. We're, er, done here.
Just heading home.

39:09.400 --> 39:11.720
Thanks very much
for all your help, love.

39:11.720 --> 39:13.080
Anything I can do, Shruti?

39:13.080 --> 39:16.080
The problem I was worried about
is a problem-problem.

39:16.080 --> 39:18.760
This is the second full day
of being messed around

39:18.760 --> 39:21.600
by this department.
And just so you know, Dr...

39:21.600 --> 39:23.240
..er, Kay, I am going to
complain about all this.

39:23.240 --> 39:25.680
Just give me five minutes
with your wife, please, sir,

39:25.680 --> 39:27.360
and then you can complain
to the chief executive,

39:27.360 --> 39:29.240
the Health Secretary,
and Princess Michael of Kent

39:29.240 --> 39:31.680
for all I care.  We're leaving.
Come on.

39:31.680 --> 39:33.480
No.  Hey!

39:33.480 --> 39:35.160
That's assault. Did you see that?

39:35.160 --> 39:37.560
He assaulted me. Come on.  Ernie...

39:37.560 --> 39:40.080
Get out of my way.  You know what,
maybe we should just go home.

39:40.080 --> 39:41.720
Sweetheart, listen, listen, listen.

39:41.720 --> 39:43.280
Can we just get Ernie?
Shut your mouth.

39:43.280 --> 39:46.000
No, hey...  Come with us, please.
This is mental.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.720
Totally unnecessary.  This way, sir.

39:47.720 --> 39:49.560
I, I need to speak
to somebody senior.

39:49.560 --> 39:50.800
No, you need to come with us.

39:50.800 --> 39:53.200
ANGUS:  Tell them!
I've done nothing wrong.

39:53.200 --> 39:54.920
I'll leave this with you, Shruti.

39:54.920 --> 39:56.480
ANGUS:  This is ridiculous.
Who do I need to speak to?

39:56.480 --> 39:57.920
Well done.
ANGUS:  Anna!

39:57.920 --> 40:00.920

recently refurbished suite.

something of a surprise.

40:10.760 --> 40:12.560
Er, shall we?

40:12.560 --> 40:14.640
Oh, shit, they're taking
photographs.

40:15.720 --> 40:17.480
Better change
the patients' initials.

40:17.480 --> 40:19.000
For confidentiality.

so that's time to get you and Ernie

40:39.280 --> 40:41.160
somewhere safe.
I don't need somewhere safe.

40:41.160 --> 40:43.080
Anna, you don't have to
put up with this any more.

40:43.080 --> 40:45.720
He only got angry today because it
was all taking so long.

40:45.720 --> 40:47.720
You told me that he... SHE CLEARS THROAT

40:49.000 --> 40:52.080

I'll be right back.

40:56.120 --> 40:58.200
DOOR CLOSES Well, what now?

40:58.200 --> 41:01.240
We'll work out a safeguarding plan.
You did really well today.

41:01.240 --> 41:04.000
It's all fucking pointless,
though, isn't it?

41:04.000 --> 41:06.640
ERNIE:  Fucking pointless.
Fucking pointless.

stand me up there.

41:23.880 --> 41:25.320
Oh, my God.

41:26.520 --> 41:29.280
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Er, what time is it?

41:29.280 --> 41:32.800
How long have you been waiting?
Er, don't worry.

41:32.800 --> 41:35.080
They're holding our table for us.

41:35.080 --> 41:36.680
Er...

41:36.680 --> 41:40.280
..listen, do you mind if,
if we raincheck, please?

41:40.280 --> 41:42.280
I'm not feeling too great.

41:43.440 --> 41:45.160
No worries. Another time.

41:46.640 --> 41:48.280
See you around.

41:59.000 --> 42:03.280
I will end with the Prayer
of Commendation for the Dying.

42:04.520 --> 42:09.480
To you, O Lord, we commend
the soul of Magda Winnicka,

42:09.480 --> 42:11.480
your servant.

42:11.480 --> 42:15.800
In the sight of this world
she is now dead.

42:15.800 --> 42:19.160
In your sight, may she live forever.

42:21.040 --> 42:25.800
Forgive whatever sins she committed
through human weakness...

I'm just...

I've had better days.

43:02.120 --> 43:04.440
Were you...close?

43:04.440 --> 43:05.520
Um...

43:07.760 --> 43:09.360
I think she hated me, actually.

43:19.240 --> 43:21.760
Seriously, it really means
a lot that you brought me here.

43:21.760 --> 43:23.960
Bring you to
all the best places, don't I?

43:25.400 --> 43:27.560
I've been thinking a lot about...

43:30.240 --> 43:32.160
..that question you asked me.

43:36.560 --> 43:37.800
I've changed my mind.

43:43.800 --> 43:45.120
Go on, ask it again.

43:47.960 --> 43:49.040
Will you marry me?

43:53.120 --> 43:54.200
Of course I will.

43:59.240 --> 44:01.680
Are you sure?  Yes, I'm sure.

44:01.680 --> 44:03.400
