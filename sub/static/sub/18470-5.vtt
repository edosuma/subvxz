15:06.974 --> 15:09.074
The victim's constant questioning
about the village

15:09.134 --> 15:11.554
was getting on Kitty Oswood's
nerves, apparently.

15:11.614 --> 15:13.554
OK?
Yeah.

15:13.614 --> 15:15.434
Mrs Oswood?

15:15.494 --> 15:17.954
I gather Miss Berry
was rather inquisitive.

15:18.014 --> 15:20.034
Did you know she was a journalist?

15:21.174 --> 15:23.474
Did her questions annoy you?

15:23.534 --> 15:26.914
Could have done without it.
NELL: See you at the dance.

15:26.974 --> 15:28.194
Bye.

15:28.254 --> 15:30.594
My sister. She's helping me
with the food and drink.

15:34.334 --> 15:36.954
We'll need background checks
on the Oswoods,

15:37.014 --> 15:39.434
and speak to, uh, Doug Vaughan.

15:39.494 --> 15:43.314
He runs the drone delivery trial
for medicines.

15:43.374 --> 15:46.994
See if he has any cameras
on those drones.

15:50.654 --> 15:54.794
(WARNING ALARM BLARES)

16:13.774 --> 16:17.154
RONIN: Reckon we're fast as ever.
We must be ahead of schedule, right?

16:17.214 --> 16:18.834
DOUG: It's not a race.

16:18.894 --> 16:21.114
Think health and safety. Go easy.

16:23.894 --> 16:25.794
DS Winter.

16:25.854 --> 16:27.954
Uh, Doug Vaughan, Ronin Chow.

16:28.014 --> 16:30.754
Are we in trouble?
Depends.

16:32.134 --> 16:33.674
Her name's Samantha Berry.

16:33.734 --> 16:35.954
She was found dead in the woods
near here this morning.

16:36.014 --> 16:38.034
Do you recognise her?
No.

16:40.734 --> 16:43.274
Can I get on?
Not yet, no.

16:43.334 --> 16:45.274
She was a journalist.

16:45.334 --> 16:48.514
It seems she was interested in
your drone delivery trial.

16:48.574 --> 16:51.994
She was not the only one.
We've had a lot of press interest.

16:52.054 --> 16:55.554
These trials are the first of
their kind - ground-breaking, even.

16:55.614 --> 16:57.234
Is it just medicine
that you deliver?

16:57.294 --> 17:00.994
Uh, at the moment, yes,
but we hope to expand.

17:01.054 --> 17:03.754
The drones you use have, um,
cameras attached, right?

17:03.814 --> 17:07.474
No. The ones we're using
in the trial all navigate by GPS.

17:07.534 --> 17:10.034
They're much quieter, which is
the main reason we got the trial.

17:10.094 --> 17:13.594
We can attach cameras to them,
but there are issues around privacy.

17:13.654 --> 17:15.834
And given that this is a trial,

17:15.894 --> 17:18.354
well, we have to do everything
by the book.

17:21.654 --> 17:25.554
Jane Austen came here for tea,
not Whitcombe Grange.

17:25.614 --> 17:27.994
Does that matter?
Absolutely.

17:28.054 --> 17:30.194
It's about being authentic.

17:30.254 --> 17:34.914
Jane actually sat in here,
in this very room.

17:34.974 --> 17:38.554
Can you imagine? Everything here
is rooted in research.

17:38.614 --> 17:41.754
I should know. I studied history
at Magdalen College, Oxford.

17:42.654 --> 17:45.074
I thought it was
pronounced 'Maudlin'.

17:45.134 --> 17:47.514
You say po-tay-to, I say po-tah-to.

17:47.574 --> 17:51.874
My point is I do walks and talks
and give lectures,

17:51.934 --> 17:55.114
whereas James and Kitty
are more playing at it.

17:57.614 --> 18:00.674
They do bring Jane Austen fans
to the village,

18:00.734 --> 18:03.634
though presumably not to
your tea rooms, Miss Christie.

18:03.694 --> 18:05.554
It's not a competition.

18:05.614 --> 18:07.274
Hmm.

18:07.334 --> 18:10.314
What would Jane Austen
have written with?

18:11.334 --> 18:14.634
Well, a feathered quill.
Goose feather, probably.

18:14.694 --> 18:17.194
I'd be fascinated to see
one of those.

18:17.254 --> 18:19.274
I have one, over here.

18:21.054 --> 18:23.114
Oh, that's odd.

18:24.334 --> 18:26.034
It's disappeared.

18:29.894 --> 18:31.754
The key's still here.

18:33.054 --> 18:37.474
Does anyone else know about the key
or have access to the shop?

18:37.534 --> 18:39.914
Ray Fryer, at the pub.

18:39.974 --> 18:43.474
He has my spare. He sometimes
drops deliveries in for me.

18:43.534 --> 18:48.354
Well, it may have been used
to kill Miss Berry.

18:48.414 --> 18:49.914
Oh...

18:50.934 --> 18:53.034
You said you'd never met
Samantha Berry.

18:53.094 --> 18:54.274
Correct.

18:55.574 --> 18:58.834
Then, how come her signature
is in your visitor's book?

18:58.894 --> 19:01.674
I don't speak to everyone
that comes in.

19:04.134 --> 19:06.594
NELL: Samantha Berry? Yeah.

19:06.654 --> 19:08.554
She stayed a couple of nights
last week.

19:08.614 --> 19:11.114
Did Miss Berry say why she was here?

19:11.174 --> 19:13.514
No. I...didn't ask.

19:14.774 --> 19:17.794
(BOTH SPEAK INDISTINCTLY)

19:19.574 --> 19:23.274
I gather you're helping
your sister out with the event?

19:23.334 --> 19:25.274
Well, as much as we can.

19:25.334 --> 19:28.354
Gorgeous Georgians -
it's a great idea, isn't it?

19:28.414 --> 19:30.474
Not my cup of tea, to be honest.

19:30.534 --> 19:33.194
All that period malarky
brings me out in a rash.

19:33.254 --> 19:36.274
It's all I can do
to keep up with the present.

19:36.334 --> 19:37.874
At least this is fun.

19:37.934 --> 19:39.994
No-one's asking you to join in, Ray.

19:40.054 --> 19:41.954
It's just as well.

19:42.014 --> 19:45.034
Kitty wanted to breathe life
into the family home.

19:45.934 --> 19:47.994
You used to live
in Whitcombe Grange?

19:48.054 --> 19:49.554
It's where me and Kitty grew up.

19:50.454 --> 19:52.554
James and Kitty
bought the house back.

19:52.614 --> 19:55.194
Whereas you've gone from the Grange
to the local pub.

19:55.254 --> 19:56.394
See what I've done to her?

19:56.454 --> 19:58.994
That's what happens when
you're married to an ex-copper.

19:59.054 --> 20:01.074
From nicking criminals
to pulling pints.

20:01.134 --> 20:02.994
There are worse things.

20:03.054 --> 20:05.554
You also help with the deliveries
to the tea room.

20:05.614 --> 20:07.354
When were you last there?

20:07.414 --> 20:09.674
I took a few things around
last night.

20:09.734 --> 20:12.794
Did you...see anything unusual?

20:12.854 --> 20:16.874
I may be a bit rusty
with my surveillance, but...no.

21:39.694 --> 21:41.914
Have you heard of Whitcombe Grange?

21:41.974 --> 21:43.074
Yes, of course.

21:43.134 --> 21:45.394
They've got a Georgian event
going on there at the moment.

21:45.454 --> 21:47.194
And a murder investigation.

21:48.174 --> 21:51.514
Well, I'll bear that in mind.
I'm off to their dance this evening.

21:52.654 --> 21:55.554
Research. Are you going to be there?

21:55.614 --> 21:56.834
Yes.

21:56.894 --> 21:58.714
A woman has been killed there

21:58.774 --> 22:01.354
and it's possible that someone
is targeting the event.

22:01.414 --> 22:04.034
I don't think you should go.
I'll be fine.

22:04.094 --> 22:07.954
Maybe it'll add a bit of spice
and intrigue to my book.

22:08.014 --> 22:09.594
But if someone is...
No buts!

22:09.654 --> 22:12.674
Period dress is hired
and the babysitter's booked.

22:12.734 --> 22:14.794
I could order a costume for you too,
if you like.

22:14.854 --> 22:16.754
No...
And Jamie as well.

22:16.814 --> 22:19.714
It would make you less conspicuous.

22:21.094 --> 22:23.434
Oh, by the way, I meant to ask,
when's Kam back?

22:23.494 --> 22:25.434
Only I need some medical advice
on TB.

22:25.494 --> 22:27.074
My heroine's at death's door.

22:27.134 --> 22:28.674
Well, not for another week or two.

22:28.734 --> 22:31.754
But, um, Petra is covering.
You could have a word with her.

22:31.814 --> 22:33.634
OK, will do. Is she friendly?

22:34.574 --> 22:36.154
Very.

22:37.854 --> 22:40.714
PETRA: The cause of death
wasn't loss of blood.

22:40.774 --> 22:42.474
It was asphyxiation.

22:42.534 --> 22:44.434
I thought she was stabbed
with a pen.

22:44.494 --> 22:46.874
The nib had dipped
in succinylcholine.

22:46.934 --> 22:48.874
'Sucs' for short.

22:48.934 --> 22:51.394
A neuromuscular drug
that paralyses the muscles,

22:51.454 --> 22:52.954
including those used for breathing.

22:53.014 --> 22:56.314
A poison pen.
So, the killer knows their medicine.

22:57.414 --> 22:59.394
Did Forensics find any prints
on the pen

22:59.454 --> 23:01.034
or on the display case
in the tea shop?

23:01.094 --> 23:03.274
Both wiped. Syringe, likewise.

23:03.334 --> 23:05.034
The syringe had traces
of morphine in it.

23:05.094 --> 23:08.954
The one that killed her - sucs -
is it easy to get hold of?

23:09.014 --> 23:11.554
From pharmaceutical suppliers, yes.

you don't know about?

if you want to show me.

(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)

23:40.054 --> 23:42.034
JOHN: Nothing was stolen.

23:42.094 --> 23:45.914
So, what could be on your computer
that someone would want to destroy?

23:45.974 --> 23:50.394
I don't know. There's just details
of deliveries, addresses, footage...

23:50.454 --> 23:51.954
Footage?

23:52.014 --> 23:54.194
You said yesterday
that the drones didn't have cameras,

23:54.254 --> 23:56.194
that they navigated by GPS.

23:56.254 --> 23:58.474
Historically, we've filmed events.

23:58.534 --> 24:00.274
Weddings, all sorts.

24:01.414 --> 24:05.034
Why would someone
want to destroy old footage?

24:07.374 --> 24:10.234
What do you think?
That he might be lying.

24:10.294 --> 24:12.114
Check him out.
I already have.

24:12.174 --> 24:13.594
He's got a criminal record.

24:13.654 --> 24:15.474
He was done for joyriding
as a teenager.

24:15.534 --> 24:17.514
Nicked by Ray Fryer,
back when he was a copper.

24:17.574 --> 24:19.114
Let's keep an eye on him.

24:19.174 --> 24:21.074
Break-in could have been staged.

24:21.134 --> 24:22.674
It could, indeed.

24:25.534 --> 24:29.154
Mark every drone delivery route
from yesterday morning onto a map,

24:29.214 --> 24:31.394
see if any went near
the murder scene.

24:31.454 --> 24:33.394
I'll look into this drug, sucs.

24:33.454 --> 24:36.594
Doctor Franks would be able to
order it. Jane Everard might too.

24:36.654 --> 24:38.954
As might his pharmacist,
Mary Oswood.

24:41.894 --> 24:44.474
OK. Let me know
when you're back up and running.

24:44.534 --> 24:45.754
RONIN: Will do.

24:46.934 --> 24:50.074
Someone broke into drone HQ.

24:50.134 --> 24:52.474
I think we can use it
to our advantage.

24:52.534 --> 24:54.274
I'm all yours.

25:01.974 --> 25:04.994
Oh, I'm sorry to keep you waiting,
Inspector. I'm rushed off my feet.

25:05.054 --> 25:06.714
Please, come into the office.

25:10.374 --> 25:12.954
Do you, uh, recognise this woman?

25:13.014 --> 25:14.434
Yes.

25:14.494 --> 25:16.114
Poor thing came to see me last week

25:16.174 --> 25:18.314
to ask some questions
about James and Kitty -

25:18.374 --> 25:20.914
how long they'd known each other,
how they met.

25:20.974 --> 25:24.514
As James's stepmum, I wasn't really
on the scene back then.

25:24.574 --> 25:27.194
Didn't you think it odd
that she was asking -

25:27.254 --> 25:29.954
a stranger to the village,
down from London?

25:30.014 --> 25:31.354
Not really.

25:31.414 --> 25:34.994
James's and Kitty's marriage
has never seemed exactly...solid.

25:35.054 --> 25:37.314
Who knows what went on in London?

25:37.374 --> 25:40.114
Are you saying Miss Berry
might have known James?

25:41.334 --> 25:44.914
I'm saying his private life
is his private life.

25:57.134 --> 26:00.914
As the pharmacist, Mrs Oswood,
presumably you order the medicines.

26:00.974 --> 26:04.874
Would that include a drug
called succinylcholine?

26:04.934 --> 26:07.594
I've heard of it,
but I've never ordered it. Why?

26:07.654 --> 26:09.914
It was used to kill Miss Berry.

26:11.694 --> 26:14.914
Could anyone else have ordered
that drug through the surgery?

26:14.974 --> 26:17.474
Only myself and Solomon.

26:19.014 --> 26:20.754
What about morphine?

26:20.814 --> 26:22.474
Do you order that in?

You aren't like this at work.

27:43.214 --> 27:45.834
What - dressed in period costume?

27:45.894 --> 27:47.354
Is that your thing?

27:48.574 --> 27:50.754
Anyway, I'm disappointed in you.

27:50.814 --> 27:52.234
Why?

27:52.294 --> 27:55.394
Because I have to dress like a lady
in order to catch your eye.

27:55.454 --> 27:57.274
A true gentleman
would be able to look

27:57.334 --> 27:59.954
past my lowly receptionist status.

28:01.694 --> 28:03.554

the drones travel as the crow flies,

these are the routes travelled
yesterday morning.

28:38.654 --> 28:42.634
Samantha Berry's body was found
here. No deliveries went that close.

28:42.694 --> 28:45.994

and her husband, Walter, live.

Several deliveries went past there.

of the crime back here,

28:50.454 --> 28:51.834
they might have seen a drone

28:51.894 --> 28:53.674
and been worried they were
caught on camera,

28:53.734 --> 28:55.394
so targeted Ronin's laptop.

28:55.454 --> 28:56.394
There's more.

28:56.454 --> 28:59.194
Walter Oswood used to be the
headmaster of the local school,

28:59.254 --> 29:03.154
retired two years ago, after raising
his hands against a pupil.

29:03.214 --> 29:06.114
And we're still triangulating
the whereabouts

29:06.174 --> 29:07.954
of Samantha Berry's missing phone,

29:08.014 --> 29:11.394
but we traced her service provider.

29:11.454 --> 29:14.994
One call since she's been the event,
on the night before she died.

29:15.054 --> 29:17.314
The number registered to...

29:17.374 --> 29:19.474
Walter Oswood.

29:19.534 --> 29:21.354
Time to pay him a visit.

29:21.414 --> 29:22.354
Mm-hm.

29:23.574 --> 29:26.634
I imagine you know what happened.

29:26.694 --> 29:27.994
Yes.

29:28.054 --> 29:30.954
The pupil who reported you,
are they still in the village?

29:31.014 --> 29:32.874
No, they didn't report it.

29:32.934 --> 29:37.274
The incident was caught
on a drone camera by Doug Vaughan.

29:37.334 --> 29:39.154
He was filming the school event

29:39.214 --> 29:42.754
and felt obliged
to inform the authorities.

29:42.814 --> 29:44.434
Doug Vaughan reported you?

29:44.494 --> 29:46.634
Well, It was the right thing to do.

29:46.694 --> 29:49.074
I don't blame Doug or the boy.

29:49.134 --> 29:51.034
It was no-one's fault but my own.

29:51.094 --> 29:54.034
I lost my temper. I shouldn't have.

29:54.094 --> 29:57.074
How did your son, James,
feel about Doug doing that?

29:57.134 --> 29:58.394
Hmm! Not great.

29:58.454 --> 30:01.674
But then, James and Doug have been
at war since they were boys.

30:02.774 --> 30:05.114
How well did you know
Samantha Berry?

30:05.174 --> 30:07.554
You mean, did I lose my temper
with her too?

30:07.614 --> 30:09.594
No. I didn't.

30:09.654 --> 30:11.234
When did you last speak to her?

30:11.294 --> 30:14.274
She rang me the night before last.

30:14.334 --> 30:16.314
It was odd, really.

30:16.374 --> 30:20.074
She simply wanted to know
when James and Katherine

30:20.134 --> 30:21.954
started seeing each other.

30:23.374 --> 30:26.314
What time did you go to the Grange
yesterday morning?

30:26.374 --> 30:28.754
9:30.
Where were you before then?

30:28.814 --> 30:30.914
Fishing. By the river.

30:30.974 --> 30:32.994
From 6am.

30:33.054 --> 30:34.834
Can anyone confirm that?

30:34.894 --> 30:37.314
Yes. Solomon saw me.

30:37.374 --> 30:40.634
But he's staying at the Grange,
which is nowhere near the river.

30:40.694 --> 30:44.354
That's as may be, but he rushed past
in all his period get-up.

30:45.854 --> 30:47.474
Walter must be mistaken.

30:47.534 --> 30:49.474
His eyesight isn't exactly 20/20,
is it?

30:49.534 --> 30:51.394
Doctor Franks,
you were in period costume.

30:51.454 --> 30:52.874
He was quite clear about that.

30:52.934 --> 30:54.514
And we know that you
went somewhere that morning.

30:54.574 --> 30:55.954
That's why you were late
to the picnic.

30:56.014 --> 30:57.594
I told you, I went for a walk.

30:57.654 --> 30:59.914
Are you aware of succinylcholine?

30:59.974 --> 31:03.114
I've heard of it, yes.
Do any of your patients use it?

31:03.174 --> 31:06.074
I'm sorry. I have to maintain
patient-doctor confidentiality.

31:06.134 --> 31:07.834
What about morphine?

31:10.334 --> 31:14.074
Your pharmacist also hesitated
when I mentioned morphine.

31:14.134 --> 31:17.034
We found traces of it in a syringe
that was left in the folly.

31:17.094 --> 31:18.554
Do you know anything about that?

31:18.614 --> 31:20.154
Morphine is quite common. It's...

31:20.214 --> 31:22.554
Mainly used as pain relief.

31:22.614 --> 31:25.354
Suppose someone needed it
medicinally,

31:25.414 --> 31:28.234
but they lost the syringe
used to inject it?

31:28.294 --> 31:29.914
They'd need a replacement.

31:29.974 --> 31:32.634
A doctor could get a replacement
from his surgery, if he was quick.

31:32.694 --> 31:34.154
Perhaps not taking the time

31:34.214 --> 31:35.874
to change his clothes
or greet passers-by,

31:35.934 --> 31:38.594
in order to return to his friends
at a picnic.

31:41.334 --> 31:43.994

I...still have trouble
with my pelvis and back.

31:56.814 --> 31:58.514
So, why the secrecy?

32:00.014 --> 32:01.674

isn't it?

32:10.774 --> 32:14.714
Mm. Yeah. I was going to dispose of
the syringe after the event.

32:14.774 --> 32:18.034
When you were at the folly,
did you see anyone else?

32:18.974 --> 32:20.474
No.

32:22.134 --> 32:24.714
But I thought I heard a drone.

32:41.334 --> 32:43.794
Well, I'm surprised
you could make it.

in the middle of a barn dance,

32:45.854 --> 32:47.474

about James and Kitty Oswood.

start getting ready.

No. With Petra.

34:50.294 --> 34:52.194

34:52.254 --> 34:53.674

34:53.734 --> 34:55.914

to pick her brains on TB

34:55.974 --> 34:58.394

she picked mine on Jamie.

was attempted murder?

I suspect it was a warning.

No.

organically.

just isn't like that, is it?

says he didn't mean to hurt anyone,

against the family.

50:11.014 --> 50:13.074
He thought they were
above themselves.

50:13.134 --> 50:16.034
Clearly didn't think so then.

or Johnny Fullerton.

that happened here.

51:23.454 --> 51:26.554
Did Samantha Berry ask about it?

51:26.614 --> 51:29.114
Or about Annie Ingham?

of someone

51:49.734 --> 51:51.314

51:51.374 --> 51:55.354

been delivering to the Grange.

54:17.054 --> 54:19.834

you want to tell us about?

was flying about in the vicinity

54:22.734 --> 54:24.474
when Samantha Berry was murdered?

54:24.534 --> 54:26.674
From the list you gave us,
there were no deliveries

54:26.734 --> 54:28.234

anywhere near the folly.

54:28.294 --> 54:29.474

that you lent to Ray Fryer.

54:36.974 --> 54:38.714
We're friends.
Touching.

54:38.774 --> 54:41.794
Given that he arrested you
for joyriding a few years ago.

54:41.854 --> 54:45.194
That's why were mates.
He stood by me.

54:45.254 --> 54:47.994
I was in danger of going off
the rails. He made sure I didn't.

54:48.054 --> 54:51.634
So, could Ray have been
flying that drone?

54:52.574 --> 54:54.154
No. It...

54:55.214 --> 54:56.914
It...

54:59.014 --> 55:00.274

to do some filming for him.

55:06.374 --> 55:08.834
What are you doing,
filming for that idiot?

55:08.894 --> 55:11.114
You can't do that, you work for me!

55:11.174 --> 55:13.154
So, there was a camera attached?

55:13.214 --> 55:15.474
What did you film?

James wants some footage

55:20.174 --> 55:22.234
I thought I'd get
some shots of the house.

55:22.294 --> 55:24.674
I came across that woman
walking through the fields,

55:24.734 --> 55:26.594
I thought it looked good,
so I followed her.

55:26.654 --> 55:28.314
Go on.

I lost her in the woods.

she was dead.

55:33.934 --> 55:36.354
Where is the footage now?

If I were you, I'd tell us
everything you saw.

55:48.334 --> 55:51.394
I caught a glimpse of a blue anorak
with the logo of a unicorn.

55:52.414 --> 55:55.034
I thought it was Ray's
but I didn't want to drop him in it.

The night before she was killed,
Samantha Berry left the Grange.

Uh, night off.
A few bevvies at the golf club.

56:31.454 --> 56:33.314
We can check.

56:33.374 --> 56:35.274
You can, indeed.

Oh, um, one other thing.

56:39.854 --> 56:42.034
Johnny Fullerton,
how well did you know him?

56:42.094 --> 56:45.314
Uh, I...I didn't...really.

56:51.054 --> 56:52.834
Gemma Christie -

56:52.894 --> 56:54.834
she's been lying to us all along.

57:05.934 --> 57:09.634
I cannot believe
that you would betray me

57:09.694 --> 57:12.554
with James Oswood, of all the people!

57:12.614 --> 57:15.274
What's it to you? You were
schmoozing with him earlier.

57:15.334 --> 57:17.794
What was that all about?
That is none of your business.

57:17.854 --> 57:22.754
The point is I gave you a chance.
I took you on when no-one else would.

57:22.814 --> 57:24.954
You only took me on
because Ray twisted your arm.

57:25.014 --> 57:27.434
I taught you everything you know.

57:27.494 --> 57:29.354
Yeah, well...

Miss Christie, we checked.

59:11.494 --> 59:13.514
You didn't go to Oxford University.

59:14.854 --> 59:16.954

59:34.374 --> 59:36.474
Did she say she was going to
tell people?

59:36.534 --> 59:40.034
She just asked me lots of questions
I couldn't answer.

into, Ronin has been murdered,

1:01:37.134 --> 1:01:40.154

launched against us.

1:01:41.534 --> 1:01:43.474
An anonymous online protest page

1:01:43.534 --> 1:01:45.474
pointing out
that it is illegal for drones

1:01:45.534 --> 1:01:48.274
to fly too close to anyone
without permission.

1:01:49.174 --> 1:01:52.074
Why is that a problem, unless
you have been breaking the law?

There appears to be photographs

1:01:56.454 --> 1:02:00.354
proving that our drones went
closer to people than 50 metres.

1:02:00.414 --> 1:02:02.514
Didn't Ronin know not to do that?

1:02:04.214 --> 1:02:07.074
He was a speed freak
when I met him and...

1:02:07.134 --> 1:02:10.674
..I thought I'd ironed it
out of him, but...maybe not.

1:02:11.694 --> 1:02:14.394
So, you had two reasons
to be angry with Ronin?

1:02:14.454 --> 1:02:18.234
One, he was filming for James Oswood
behind your back

1:02:18.294 --> 1:02:21.554
and, two, he risked
jeopardising your trial.

1:02:21.614 --> 1:02:23.354
What is your point, Inspector?

1:02:23.414 --> 1:02:26.034

after we left this morning?

that Ray Fryer borrowed.

Is your husband here, Mrs Fryer?

1:03:09.774 --> 1:03:12.674
He's gone out.
I'm not sure where.

Before the drone trials, how did
the surgery deliver its medicine?

We ran a home-delivery service.

1:03:58.894 --> 1:04:00.034
Who did the drop-offs?

1:04:00.094 --> 1:04:03.474
Nell Fryer used to do it for me
until the pub got too busy for her.

1:04:03.534 --> 1:04:05.434
Who took over then?
I did.

1:04:05.494 --> 1:04:08.594
As a sideline from the tea rooms.
I delivered them on my bicycle.

1:04:08.654 --> 1:04:11.114
Neither of you are fans
of the drone trial, are you?

1:04:11.174 --> 1:04:13.354
Well, it's not our place to say.

It's just my job to make it work.

1:04:15.174 --> 1:04:17.994
But are you? There's a campaign
against the trial.

1:04:18.054 --> 1:04:21.474
Now, you had photographs of the
drones in action on your counter.

1:04:21.534 --> 1:04:24.234
The campaign website
had similar photographs.

1:04:24.294 --> 1:04:26.674
And it seems someone knew
the routes Ronin was taking.

1:04:26.734 --> 1:04:29.114
Perhaps you gave them to Gemma.

1:04:29.174 --> 1:04:33.794

to the drone trial extends to Ronin.

seen him since he went to prison.

because he knew his daddy
wouldn't see it.

1:11:59.814 --> 1:12:03.994
Do you know what it's like
to be humiliated every day!

1:12:05.094 --> 1:12:06.754
To dread school.

1:12:09.774 --> 1:12:14.874
But given that you invaded his
privacy, extorted money from him,

1:12:14.934 --> 1:12:18.354
and perhaps goaded his father
into losing his job...

1:12:19.454 --> 1:12:24.034
..you might have killed Samantha
Berry to sabotage his new business.

1:12:24.094 --> 1:12:26.794
And we know that you were angry
with Ronin.

1:12:40.734 --> 1:12:43.714
Ronin Chow told Polly
he'd got it wrong.

1:12:43.774 --> 1:12:46.034
What did he mean?

1:12:46.094 --> 1:12:48.674
And what made him realise
his mistake?

1:12:50.814 --> 1:12:53.834
Check Doug Vaughan's computer,
see what you can find.

1:12:55.174 --> 1:12:57.194
I'll speak to Ray Fryer.

1:13:09.734 --> 1:13:11.314
I tried.

1:13:13.694 --> 1:13:15.274
(SIGHS) God, I tried.

1:13:21.294 --> 1:13:24.074
I've loved you as much as I can.
Spare me.

1:13:25.854 --> 1:13:27.634
I always knew
something wasn't right.

1:13:27.694 --> 1:13:29.154
I just didn't want to confront it.

1:13:31.214 --> 1:13:33.274
Was it just James?

1:13:33.334 --> 1:13:34.714
Just James.

1:13:39.974 --> 1:13:41.554
I'm sorry.

1:13:50.054 --> 1:13:52.274
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

1:13:57.174 --> 1:14:00.314
Everything alright?
Not really.

1:14:02.134 --> 1:14:04.434
Whatever it is, son,

1:14:04.494 --> 1:14:06.554
I'm always here for you.

1:14:17.854 --> 1:14:19.634
Miss Everard,

1:14:19.694 --> 1:14:24.834
as mentioned, my behaviour here
has fallen short - elsewhere too.

1:14:24.894 --> 1:14:27.594
But if you will allow me
the honour...

1:14:28.974 --> 1:14:30.514
MAN: Looking forward to this.

1:14:31.694 --> 1:14:35.474
..would you be so kind as to consider
giving me your hand in marriage?

1:14:43.854 --> 1:14:47.354
Is a pay rise possible?
Hey, don't...don't push it.

1:14:47.414 --> 1:14:49.154
The offer won't last forever.

1:14:50.094 --> 1:14:51.474
Oh, alright then.

1:14:54.694 --> 1:14:56.114
I will.
ONLOOKERS: Oh!

1:14:57.854 --> 1:14:59.274
WOMAN: Lovely!

1:14:59.334 --> 1:15:01.274
Oh! Marvellous!

1:15:01.334 --> 1:15:03.674
Right. Moving swiftly on
to the nuptials...

1:15:03.734 --> 1:15:05.114
Can we stop all this?

1:15:05.174 --> 1:15:07.474
Don't be ridiculous.
We've got a wedding to host.

1:15:07.534 --> 1:15:09.194
No. We need to talk.

1:15:09.254 --> 1:15:10.794
I have to tell you something.

1:15:13.414 --> 1:15:16.034
The drone - where is it?

1:15:16.094 --> 1:15:17.914
Someone must have taken it.

1:15:17.974 --> 1:15:22.634
The night before Samantha Berry
died, we checked with the golf club.

1:15:22.694 --> 1:15:25.554
They said that you popped in briefly
and then left. Where did you go?

1:15:25.614 --> 1:15:28.834
To stand outside the Grange,
hoping to see James.

1:15:29.734 --> 1:15:32.794
And this morning, before you went
to confront Doug Vaughan?

1:15:32.854 --> 1:15:34.634
I was with James.

1:15:34.694 --> 1:15:37.514
That's when he told me
Doug knew about us.

1:15:37.574 --> 1:15:40.194
Did Samantha Berry
or Ronin Chow know?

1:15:41.894 --> 1:15:44.274
Even though you were close to Ronin,

1:15:44.334 --> 1:15:47.154
although he did briefly suspect you
of murder, didn't he?

1:15:47.214 --> 1:15:49.634
He was mistaken, I told you.

1:15:50.974 --> 1:15:54.914
Did your involvement with James
start before or after the fire?

1:15:56.854 --> 1:15:58.914
It was a couple of years later.

1:15:59.974 --> 1:16:02.114
After Nell and Kitty
had moved out of the Grange,

1:16:02.174 --> 1:16:04.394
um, Nell was away nursing,

1:16:04.454 --> 1:16:08.074
but me, James and Kitty
saw a lot of each other.

1:16:09.014 --> 1:16:10.914
How long did your affair last?

1:16:10.974 --> 1:16:13.434
Until Kitty got pregnant with Polly.

1:16:14.694 --> 1:16:16.674
James decided to do
the honourable thing,

1:16:16.734 --> 1:16:18.714
and that's why they left for London.

1:16:20.374 --> 1:16:22.234
I...I got on with my life.

1:16:23.254 --> 1:16:24.794
Me and Nell got together.

1:16:25.934 --> 1:16:28.474
We were both missing someone.

1:16:28.534 --> 1:16:30.874
Everything was fine
until James came back.

1:16:32.094 --> 1:16:35.194
(PHONE RINGS)

1:16:37.414 --> 1:16:38.674
Hey.

1:16:39.694 --> 1:16:40.874
Yeah, don't worry.

1:16:41.774 --> 1:16:44.114
Yeah, of course.
I'll be right there.

1:16:44.174 --> 1:16:45.714
Bye.

1:16:48.334 --> 1:16:50.474
Kitty...needs me at the Grange.

1:16:52.334 --> 1:16:55.994
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

1:16:56.054 --> 1:16:58.034
What can you tell me
about Johnny Fullerton?

1:16:59.374 --> 1:17:00.914
(SIGHS)

1:17:00.974 --> 1:17:03.914
Mr Fryer, this is
a murder investigation.

1:17:08.334 --> 1:17:10.194
I've had enough of secrets.

1:17:12.214 --> 1:17:14.234
When Johnny came out of prison,

1:17:14.294 --> 1:17:16.674
he came back to see
if Kitty was still here.

1:17:18.214 --> 1:17:19.874
He was still in love with her.

1:17:21.054 --> 1:17:23.114
They were inseparable
before the fire.

1:17:24.534 --> 1:17:27.834
Does Kitty know that Johnny
came looking for her?

1:17:27.894 --> 1:17:30.914
Nell told him Kitty was with James
and had moved on.

1:17:31.934 --> 1:17:34.034
Nell thought it was best
not to tell her.

1:17:35.734 --> 1:17:37.594
She knows nothing about Johnny...

1:17:39.694 --> 1:17:41.234
..or me and James.

1:18:23.294 --> 1:18:24.954
Sir, I think I found something.

1:18:26.494 --> 1:18:27.874
OK, good work, Winter.

1:18:27.934 --> 1:18:29.634
Meet me at the Grange
as soon as you can.

1:18:29.694 --> 1:18:31.354
You need to come with me.

1:18:38.574 --> 1:18:41.074
Kitty? I'm here.

1:18:43.894 --> 1:18:46.074
He's just told me everything.

1:18:46.134 --> 1:18:47.714
Did you know?

1:18:49.694 --> 1:18:51.434
I just found out.

1:18:54.694 --> 1:18:56.394
I can't believe it.

1:18:59.974 --> 1:19:01.874
Here.

1:19:05.494 --> 1:19:06.754
Thank you.

1:19:11.694 --> 1:19:15.274
So, you're telling me that
our whole marriage was fake.

1:19:15.334 --> 1:19:19.434
I tried so hard, Kitty,
to make it work.

1:19:20.694 --> 1:19:22.394
That's not good enough.

1:19:23.694 --> 1:19:25.554
I bought into you.

1:19:25.614 --> 1:19:27.354
You bought into me?
What does that mean?

1:19:27.414 --> 1:19:31.114
I believed you. I went to London
with you. I could have stayed here.

1:19:31.174 --> 1:19:34.674
I'm sorry, I can't help it that
I'm in love with someone else.

1:19:36.454 --> 1:19:38.554
Did you ever love me?

1:19:55.814 --> 1:19:57.354
Kitty!

1:20:08.974 --> 1:20:10.714
NELL: Kitty! Stop it!

1:20:11.774 --> 1:20:13.514
Kitty! No!

1:20:13.574 --> 1:20:15.314
No!

1:20:16.694 --> 1:20:17.794
Ah...

1:20:22.014 --> 1:20:23.154
You...

1:20:24.694 --> 1:20:26.154
Kitty!

1:20:26.214 --> 1:20:27.474
You...

1:20:38.374 --> 1:20:40.514
Show me the photo.

1:20:42.934 --> 1:20:45.514
Also, Ronin Chow's phone records -

1:20:45.574 --> 1:20:48.754
20 minutes before he rang Polly
Oswood, he made one other call.

1:20:49.734 --> 1:20:53.314
Kitty!
No, I want the truth.

1:20:54.214 --> 1:20:56.954
Is that why you came back here -
because of Ray?

1:20:57.014 --> 1:20:58.794
You made us come back.
Why would you do that?

1:20:58.854 --> 1:21:00.874
Because of first love, wasn't it?

1:21:00.934 --> 1:21:03.354
Put the torch down, Mrs Oswood.

1:21:07.694 --> 1:21:10.194
Johnny Fullerton was your first love,
wasn't he?

1:21:10.254 --> 1:21:14.874
First love, last love
and everything in between.

1:21:14.934 --> 1:21:17.354
I was hoping he'd come back for me.

1:21:17.414 --> 1:21:19.714
That's why you kept his photograph.

1:21:19.774 --> 1:21:20.954
Yes.

1:21:22.054 --> 1:21:23.594
Johnny went to prison for me.

1:21:25.534 --> 1:21:27.754
I started the fire.

1:21:29.934 --> 1:21:31.794
The torch, Mrs Oswood...

1:21:42.694 --> 1:21:46.074
We were young, and we were in love.

1:21:47.374 --> 1:21:50.874
But Johnny was seeing somebody else.
He didn't love her, he loved me.

1:21:51.894 --> 1:21:55.514
He'd gone to break it off with her,
but I didn't know that,

1:21:55.574 --> 1:21:57.034
and I felt insecure.

1:21:57.094 --> 1:21:58.594
I thought he was...

1:22:02.814 --> 1:22:05.474
Mum and Dad and Nell were out.

1:22:05.534 --> 1:22:07.114
I got drunk.

1:22:08.414 --> 1:22:09.994
And I was crying.

1:22:10.894 --> 1:22:13.274
And I knocked over
an electric heater.

1:22:14.374 --> 1:22:16.154
It caught the curtains.

1:22:17.254 --> 1:22:19.074
And I ran out in a panic.

1:22:20.734 --> 1:22:22.674
I didn't think Annie was in.

1:22:24.694 --> 1:22:27.714
So, why would this Johnny
say he started the fire?

1:22:27.774 --> 1:22:30.634
Because he loved me!

1:22:30.694 --> 1:22:34.594
And he knew Kitty wouldn't cope in
prison. She wouldn't have survived.

1:22:35.734 --> 1:22:38.874
So, your bad-boy troublemaker
was nothing of the sort.

1:22:41.734 --> 1:22:44.794
Did you know Samantha Berry
was Johnny's daughter?

1:22:46.774 --> 1:22:48.674
I didn't think so.

1:22:49.694 --> 1:22:52.434
Samantha only met him once,
a few months ago,

1:22:52.494 --> 1:22:54.674
just before Johnny died.

1:22:57.294 --> 1:22:58.954
(SIGHS)

1:23:02.054 --> 1:23:05.914
Johnny told Samantha
about the fire, didn't he, Nell?

1:23:06.814 --> 1:23:08.954
But he didn't tell her
who started it.

1:23:09.014 --> 1:23:11.714
She wanted to know, so she came here.

1:23:13.454 --> 1:23:16.114
She found a photograph
of the three of you

1:23:16.174 --> 1:23:18.674
and she came to confront you,
didn't she?

1:23:20.054 --> 1:23:22.874
And that's when you realised
you had to silence her.

1:23:23.814 --> 1:23:26.234
This is ridiculous!
What are you suggesting?

1:23:26.294 --> 1:23:29.914
That you used your husband's key
to the tea room to get a quill pen,

1:23:29.974 --> 1:23:32.074
throwing suspicion
on Gemma Christie.

1:23:32.134 --> 1:23:36.114
And your nursing background
to apply the poison to the nib.

1:23:37.414 --> 1:23:41.074
Ronin realised it was you wearing
your husband's anorak, didn't he?

1:23:42.214 --> 1:23:44.714
Like I said,
there are loads of them!

1:23:44.774 --> 1:23:47.714
Ronin was about to tell us,
wasn't he?

1:23:47.774 --> 1:23:50.154
And you couldn't allow that.

1:23:53.694 --> 1:23:57.234
Mr Fryer, would you tell Kitty
what you just told me?

1:23:57.294 --> 1:23:58.874
Ray, no!

1:24:01.174 --> 1:24:02.954
Johnny did come back for you.

1:24:04.094 --> 1:24:06.754
When?
After he was released from prison.

1:24:06.814 --> 1:24:08.954
And Nell didn't tell you.

1:24:09.014 --> 1:24:10.834
Why?!

1:24:10.894 --> 1:24:13.914
Why wouldn't you tell me
something like that?

1:24:17.774 --> 1:24:20.914
It was settled, you'd moved on,
you were married, you had a family.

1:24:20.974 --> 1:24:22.994
But I wasn't happy!

1:24:24.854 --> 1:24:28.954
It was Johnny!
Why...why would you do that?!

1:24:29.014 --> 1:24:32.234
I had to. It was better left!

1:24:33.174 --> 1:24:35.434
Well, who are you to say?

1:24:35.494 --> 1:24:37.354
I was protecting you.

1:24:38.254 --> 1:24:40.154
I did what I thought
was right for you.

1:24:41.694 --> 1:24:45.594
Johnny's daughter -
she wouldn't leave it.

1:24:45.654 --> 1:24:48.634
She said she was gonna get the truth
out of you. I couldn't have that.

1:24:49.934 --> 1:24:52.434
She was gonna tell you who she was,
that Johnny had died,

1:24:52.494 --> 1:24:54.074
you'd have had another breakdown.

1:24:56.214 --> 1:24:59.274
I...sent her a note,

1:24:59.334 --> 1:25:00.914
saying to meet me.

1:25:02.734 --> 1:25:04.074
I had no choice!

1:25:04.134 --> 1:25:05.714
No!

1:25:05.774 --> 1:25:09.074
No. How dare you talk to me
about choice?!

1:25:10.134 --> 1:25:11.794
I could have been happy.

1:25:13.294 --> 1:25:14.674
Please...

1:25:16.214 --> 1:25:18.914
I'm sorry. Please...

1:25:21.494 --> 1:25:24.634
I should have confessed to the fire
all those years ago.

1:25:25.694 --> 1:25:28.074
And you should have let him
back into my life,

1:25:28.134 --> 1:25:31.154
and I will never
forgive you for that.

1:25:33.134 --> 1:25:34.914
(SOBS)

1:26:13.454 --> 1:26:16.874
Can I confess something?
Not another confession, surely?

1:26:16.934 --> 1:26:18.834
I've never read any Jane Austen.

1:26:18.894 --> 1:26:22.234
Is this what happens in them?
Uh, not really, no.

1:26:23.694 --> 1:26:26.674
That said, they do often end
with a wedding.

1:26:26.734 --> 1:26:28.434
Or sometimes two.

1:26:31.734 --> 1:26:34.594
Not sure that would happen
in a Jane Austen novel, though.

1:26:38.694 --> 1:26:41.354
(BOTH LAUGH AND CHATTER)

1:26:44.454 --> 1:26:47.314
So, what are you going to do
about the writing, then?

1:26:47.374 --> 1:26:48.874
I decided you were right -

1:26:48.934 --> 1:26:50.874
I'm going to turn it into
a murder mystery.

1:26:50.934 --> 1:26:52.434
Oh, that's all I need.

1:26:52.494 --> 1:26:54.194
I might even base the hero on you.

1:26:54.254 --> 1:26:56.314
Ah.
So, where's Jamie?

1:26:56.374 --> 1:26:59.354
Uh, he was going to have a drink
with Petra,

1:26:59.414 --> 1:27:01.154
and then he changed his mind.

1:27:01.214 --> 1:27:03.754
Did he say why?
No. And I've no idea.

1:27:03.814 --> 1:27:05.634
I leave the romance to you.

1:27:05.694 --> 1:27:08.074
