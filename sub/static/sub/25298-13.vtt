WEBVTT

00:33.493 --> 00:34.915
Look, Cricket,
I drew you holding

00:34.915 --> 00:36.537
that snake you caught earlier.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.328
Ooh!
Check out my picture of you.

00:38.328 --> 00:40.000
I drew you
as a fire-breathing dragon.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.623
But I messed up that foot,
so I gave you a rollerblade.

00:42.623 --> 00:44.925
It is like a mirror
of my soul.

00:44.925 --> 00:45.836
[woman]
Oh, my goodness!

00:45.836 --> 00:47.758
Are you seeing this place,
Dawn?

00:47.758 --> 00:48.929
I sure am, Don.

00:48.929 --> 00:50.971
We could bulldoze
this old haunted house

00:50.971 --> 00:53.013
and put in
a new hot-yoga studio!

00:53.013 --> 00:56.807
-That serves frozen yogurt?
-[both] Hot yogurt studio!

00:56.807 --> 01:01.181
Trespassers, be gone!
The next one will be a grenade!

01:01.181 --> 01:02.853
Who do you think you are?

01:02.853 --> 01:04.144
We're Don and Dawn,

01:04.144 --> 01:06.146
the hottest real estate agents
in Big City.

01:06.146 --> 01:08.899
You might have heard of us.

01:08.899 --> 01:10.991
Realtors, huh?
Well, I ain't sellin'!

01:10.991 --> 01:13.864
-Don, table form.
-Sure thing, Dawn. [whirs]

01:13.864 --> 01:16.697
I think you'll find our offer
is more than generous.

01:16.697 --> 01:18.458
Look it over
and give us a call.

01:18.458 --> 01:20.500
-We'll be waiting!
-[both chuckle]

01:20.500 --> 01:23.293
Nice try.
No one swindles Alice Green!

01:25.626 --> 01:27.377
Hot mama,
that's a lot of pistachios.

01:27.377 --> 01:29.009
With this kinda money
I could afford luxuries

01:29.009 --> 01:30.881
previously unattainable.

01:30.881 --> 01:33.974
Whee! [laughs] Yay!

01:33.974 --> 01:36.847
Cricket Green,
trampoline owner.

01:36.847 --> 01:39.309
I can't believe you'd turn down
that offer, Gramma.

01:39.309 --> 01:41.061
You must hate money.

01:41.061 --> 01:43.563
Oh, no, honey,
your Gramma loves money.

01:43.563 --> 01:45.355
But that offer
is chicken scratch

01:45.355 --> 01:47.688
compared to
the Green Family Treasure!

01:47.688 --> 01:49.069
-[cash register rings]
-Treasure?

01:49.069 --> 01:51.071
[grunts, coughs]

01:51.071 --> 01:53.864
Ahem! You were saying
something about treasure?

01:53.864 --> 01:55.946
Hmm,
I suppose I can trust you.

01:55.946 --> 01:57.868
The Green Family Treasure

01:57.868 --> 01:59.700
is buried somewhere
on this land.

01:59.700 --> 02:01.912
And it's worth ten times
as much

02:01.912 --> 02:03.914
as those flim-flammers
were offering!

02:03.914 --> 02:06.296
Ten times!?! We gotta find
that treasure right now!

02:06.296 --> 02:09.459
Heh,
if only it were that easy.

02:09.459 --> 02:12.753
Its secret location
has eluded me for years.

02:12.753 --> 02:15.595
And all I've had to go on
is this clue.

02:15.595 --> 02:17.097
[both] Whoa.

02:17.097 --> 02:18.969
Papa left me this clue
years ago,

02:18.969 --> 02:22.432
but he wrote it in a riddle,
and I'm no good at riddles.

02:22.432 --> 02:24.765
If you got something to say,
say it to me straight!

02:24.765 --> 02:26.566
Oh, I love riddles.

02:26.566 --> 02:28.438
Some of my best dreams
have been riddles.

02:28.438 --> 02:30.651
I can't wake up
till I solve them.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.482
Now let's see
what we're working with here.

02:32.482 --> 02:35.195
"To find the treasure,
answer each clue.

02:35.195 --> 02:37.277
But train yourself
to see things anew."

02:37.277 --> 02:40.080
"Start at the porch.
Be in step with time."

02:40.080 --> 02:43.043
"Use Bixby's hands
to find the next rhyme."

02:43.043 --> 02:45.125
-Bixby?
-Who's that, Gramma?

02:45.125 --> 02:47.838
Bixby and his father Jerome
were the first Greens

02:47.838 --> 02:50.000
to ever settle this land.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.091
This is it, Bixby,

02:51.091 --> 02:53.463
the future site
of the Green Family Farm.

02:53.463 --> 02:55.255
Once the train station's
finished,

02:55.255 --> 02:57.057
passengers will come
from all over

02:57.057 --> 02:59.099
-to buy our fruits and veggies.
-Sounds good, father.

02:59.099 --> 03:01.011
And, look, I already made
a new friend.

03:01.011 --> 03:04.014
-Bixby!
-[Alice]<i> And so after months</i>

03:04.014 --> 03:07.187
<i> and a few more cougar scares,
The Green Family Farm</i>

03:07.187 --> 03:09.519
<i> was officially
open for business!</i>

03:09.519 --> 03:12.362
<i> But that business
would never come.</i>

03:12.362 --> 03:14.815
<i> The 9:00 AM train
that was supposed</i>

03:14.815 --> 03:17.077
<i> thundered past
without a second thought!</i>

03:17.077 --> 03:19.369
<i> Turns out the railroad company
decided to move</i>

03:19.369 --> 03:21.782
<i> the stop
to the next town over.</i>

03:21.782 --> 03:24.084
Darn that railroad!
[grunts]

03:24.084 --> 03:26.456
Bixby! Throw your hat down
in disapproval!

03:26.456 --> 03:27.828
-[grunts]
-[sighs]

03:27.828 --> 03:29.209
We don't get any business,

03:29.209 --> 03:31.251
we're gonna have to sell
the farm

03:31.251 --> 03:33.593
Sell the farm?
I can't let that happen.

03:33.593 --> 03:36.256
-But how?
-[horse neighs]

03:36.256 --> 03:39.840
That's it. Thanks, girl.
You gave me the perfect idea.

03:39.840 --> 03:41.141
[screams]

03:41.141 --> 03:44.684
<i> The next day,
Bixby set his plan into motion.</i>

03:44.684 --> 03:47.978
-[train whistle blows]
-9:00 AM, right on time.

03:47.978 --> 03:50.440
I am so hungry,
I could eat a horse.

03:50.440 --> 03:52.652
-Oh, ho! How convenient!
-Howdy, folks.

03:52.652 --> 03:55.275
Care to buy some fresh fruit
from the Green Family Farm?

03:55.275 --> 03:58.238
Oh ho! Even better!
I'll take the entire bushel.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.781
Here you go, mister, and don't
forget to tell your friends.

04:00.781 --> 04:03.163
<i> The family farm was saved!</i>

04:03.163 --> 04:05.165
[both laugh]

04:05.165 --> 04:07.497
Cool story, Gramma, but how does
that help us find the treasure?

04:07.497 --> 04:09.369
The riddle says to start
on the porch

04:09.369 --> 04:12.292
and be "in step with time,"
whatever that means.

04:12.292 --> 04:14.084
Hmm. [gasps]

04:14.084 --> 04:16.877
Bixby's train arrived
at 9:00 AM.

04:16.877 --> 04:19.840
What if Bixby's hands
are a map?

04:19.840 --> 04:23.383
Cricket, start at the porch
and walk 12 steps forward.

04:23.383 --> 04:24.845
Woo! I'm bein' useful!

04:24.845 --> 04:26.436
What are you on about, girl?

04:26.436 --> 04:28.728
Nine, ten, 11, 12.

04:28.728 --> 04:30.891
-Now nine steps left.
-You got it!

04:30.891 --> 04:33.233
Seven, eight, ni-- huh? Hey!

04:33.233 --> 04:35.025
This big dumb rock's
in the way of nine.

04:35.025 --> 04:37.487
Gotta... [grunts]
move it... [grunts]

04:37.487 --> 04:39.279
Hmm.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.281
Psh, ain't nothin'
under that rock.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.703
You're right, Gramma.
The clue's written<i> on</i> the rock.

04:43.703 --> 04:44.955
What, really?

04:44.955 --> 04:49.369
"To save the farm,
Metrona had to fly.

04:49.369 --> 04:51.041
Tilly. Could you read
a little faster please?

04:51.041 --> 04:54.044
"Her clue is a breeze
pulling her through the sky."

04:54.044 --> 04:57.007
My gracious, I can't believe
you found the next clue!

04:57.007 --> 04:58.969
You kids are smarter
than you look.

04:58.969 --> 05:00.801
What do you think it means,
Gramma?

05:00.801 --> 05:02.632
[muffled]
Yeah! Who's Metrona?

05:02.632 --> 05:04.344
Ah, Aunt Metrona,

05:04.344 --> 05:06.847
the first Green
to conquer the sky.

05:06.847 --> 05:08.428
<i> She was a stunt pilot.</i>

05:08.428 --> 05:11.391
<i> She spent most of her days
with her head in the clouds,</i>

05:11.391 --> 05:14.194
<i> much to the worry
of her father, Archibald Green.</i>

05:14.194 --> 05:17.567
[groans, sighs]
Wow. Great flying, Metrona.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.199
This plane can really move.

05:19.199 --> 05:22.032
Although, I wish you hadn't torn
down half the farm to build it.

05:22.032 --> 05:23.403
That was my favorite barrel.

05:25.495 --> 05:29.329
Sorry, Papa,
but the sky was callin'.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.082
Besides, you can't do
barrel rolls without a barrel.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.914
[chuckles] You got me there.

05:33.914 --> 05:35.836
[both laugh]

05:35.836 --> 05:39.379
<i> But dark times lay ahead
for Archibald and Metrona.</i>

05:39.379 --> 05:42.512
<i> In the blink of an eye,
a huge swarm of aphids</i>

05:42.512 --> 05:45.425
<i>-started feasting on the farm!
</i>-[all screeching]

05:45.425 --> 05:48.388
If this keeps up I'll have
no choice but to sell the farm.

05:48.388 --> 05:50.600
<i> Metrona knew
she had to do something.</i>

05:50.600 --> 05:53.353
Why, aphids? Why?!

05:53.353 --> 05:55.235
[coughs]

05:55.235 --> 05:56.897
<i> She also knew that ladybugs</i>

05:56.897 --> 05:58.939
<i> were an aphid's
natural predator.</i>

05:58.939 --> 06:01.862
<i> So she gathered up a whole
bunch of those little critters</i>

06:01.862 --> 06:03.944
<i> and took to the sky!</i>

06:03.944 --> 06:06.907
<i> Once she was high enough,
she released the ladybugs.</i>

06:06.907 --> 06:09.619
<i> And they rained down
on the entire farm...</i>

06:09.619 --> 06:11.992
[thud, roar]

06:11.992 --> 06:14.494
<i>...eating every aphid in sight.</i>

06:14.494 --> 06:16.336
[roars]

06:16.336 --> 06:18.418
Aww, they're so cute.

06:18.418 --> 06:20.630
<i> And once again,
the farm was saved</i>

06:20.630 --> 06:23.884
by the whip-smart ingenuity
of a young Green.

06:23.884 --> 06:27.267
-Wait, you're saying we have
our very own airplane?
-Well, we did.

06:27.267 --> 06:29.509
What's left of it is buried
under the cafe now.

06:29.509 --> 06:31.601
Then that's where
the next clue must be.

06:31.601 --> 06:34.564
Let's go dig it up!
Oh, wait, Gloria will be there.

06:34.564 --> 06:38.608
Hmm, this will require
a certain degree of delicacy.

06:38.608 --> 06:41.441
The Greens are here
to take back what's ours!

06:41.441 --> 06:43.233
No! No!
I saw you guys coming.

06:43.233 --> 06:45.695
So I called the cops,
and they're on their way now.

06:45.695 --> 06:46.907
Aah! Scramble, scramble!

06:46.907 --> 06:49.329
Okay, new plan--
we disguise ourselves

06:49.329 --> 06:51.531
-as giant pigeons and--
-Forget it, Cricket.

06:51.531 --> 06:53.994
That airplane's long gone,
and so is the clue.

06:53.994 --> 06:56.957
I always thought I'd find
that treasure one day.

06:56.957 --> 06:59.709
But now I know it's impossible.

06:59.709 --> 07:01.801
Aw, come on, Gramma,
we're so close to the treasure,

07:01.801 --> 07:03.303
I can almost taste it.

07:03.303 --> 07:04.634
I mean, it tastes really bad,
but when you got

07:04.634 --> 07:07.637
-a mouth full of gold--
-Oh, my goodness goblins.

07:07.637 --> 07:09.639
We don't need to find
Metrona's plane.

07:09.639 --> 07:13.223
We just need her propeller,
and it's right in front of us.

07:13.223 --> 07:15.355
Tilly, you're a genius.
I'm on it.

07:15.355 --> 07:17.937
[grunts] Hey, there's something
written on the back!

07:17.937 --> 07:19.769
Gramma, listen to this!

07:19.769 --> 07:21.611
What?
Are you messing with me, boy?

07:21.611 --> 07:24.564
"The farm was dry.
I wanted to sell.

07:24.564 --> 07:27.277
Our family treasure
is in a place

07:27.277 --> 07:29.119
Alice knows well."

07:29.119 --> 07:31.661
[echoes]
<i> Well. Well. Well.</i>

07:31.661 --> 07:34.744
Papa, why aren't any
of my apple seeds growing?

07:34.744 --> 07:36.956
Nothing can grow
in this drought, Alice.

07:36.956 --> 07:39.749
It hasn't rained in months.
The farm's all dried up.

07:39.749 --> 07:41.421
So what are we gonna do?

07:41.421 --> 07:43.673
The same thing men
in this family have done

07:43.673 --> 07:47.757
for generations--
try to sell the farm!

07:47.757 --> 07:49.259
[grunts]

07:49.259 --> 07:51.761
[grunting]

07:51.761 --> 07:54.054
There's gotta be water here
somewhere.

07:54.054 --> 07:55.595
Alice! It's time to go.

07:55.595 --> 07:58.728
Once I sign these papers,
they're gonna start demolishing.

07:58.728 --> 08:01.231
[Alice] I don't care!
I'm not goin'!

08:01.231 --> 08:04.814
C'mon, Alice, there's
nothing left for us here.

08:04.814 --> 08:06.776
-[grunting]
-Come on now.

08:06.776 --> 08:08.068
No! No!

08:10.030 --> 08:11.911
One of my apple seeds
sprouted.

08:11.911 --> 08:14.204
There... must be... water!

08:14.204 --> 08:16.376
Huh? Alice.
Come back here!

08:18.788 --> 08:20.670
Alice! [pants]

08:22.962 --> 08:24.794
Come on, come on.

08:29.889 --> 08:32.892
Sweet corned beans. Water!

08:32.892 --> 08:36.136
Alice! Oh, Alice, you did it!
You saved the farm!

08:36.136 --> 08:39.059
Course I did. I'm Alice Green.
What'd you expect?

08:39.059 --> 08:41.811
Over there is where
we'll put our new well.

08:41.811 --> 08:43.773
[echoes]
<i> Well. Well. Well.</i>

08:43.773 --> 08:45.735
Sweet corned beans.

08:45.735 --> 08:47.907
Kids, I know where
the treasure is!

08:47.907 --> 08:49.949
-Kids?
-Oh, hey, Gramma.

08:49.949 --> 08:51.951
You were staring into space
for like 10 minutes.

08:51.951 --> 08:53.363
So we went inside
to get a snack.

08:53.363 --> 08:55.245
Tilly, Gramma solved
the last riddle!

08:55.245 --> 08:56.536
[Tilly]
'Kay, I'm comin'!

08:56.536 --> 08:58.368
[Alice]
This has gotta be the spot.

08:58.368 --> 09:01.501
Leave it to Papa to bury
the treasure near the old well,

09:01.501 --> 09:03.423
right next to my apple tree.

09:03.423 --> 09:05.255
This thing's as old as me.

09:05.255 --> 09:07.667
Wow, a thousand years old.

09:07.667 --> 09:09.339
-[shovel clangs]
-Whadya find, Gramma?

09:09.339 --> 09:11.091
It's... a box.

09:11.091 --> 09:13.093
It's a little smaller
than I thought.

09:13.093 --> 09:14.434
[both]
Open it! Open it!

09:17.387 --> 09:18.808
This isn't treasure.

09:18.808 --> 09:22.852
This is just a box
of dusty gewgaws!

09:22.852 --> 09:25.024
If that's all that's buried
on this land,

09:25.024 --> 09:26.816
then it ain't worth keepin'!

09:26.816 --> 09:29.279
Papa played
a good trick on me.

09:29.279 --> 09:31.491
Time to sell this place
and move on.

09:31.491 --> 09:32.862
[Dawn]
Did someone say "sell"?

09:32.862 --> 09:34.954
You know,
our offer still stands.

09:34.954 --> 09:36.826
All right, let's talk.

09:36.826 --> 09:39.329
Oh, my gosh, she's actually
gonna sell the farm.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.831
What the heck was in that box
that made Gramma so mad?

09:41.831 --> 09:44.164
-Here's the contract.
-Hmm.

09:44.164 --> 09:46.916
[Tilly] Metrona's goggles.
Bixby's watch.

09:46.916 --> 09:48.088
[Cricket]
Gramma's shovel.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.799
There you go.

09:49.799 --> 09:52.552
-Don't you see, Cricket,
this must be--
-A warning!

09:52.552 --> 09:54.884
Sign along the dotted line.

09:54.884 --> 09:55.975
Gramma, stop!

09:55.975 --> 09:58.518
We're here to save the farm!

09:58.518 --> 10:00.390
Huh?
What are you talking about?

10:00.390 --> 10:02.562
It's just like
in your stories, Gramma.

10:02.562 --> 10:04.224
Every generation,
the kids have to stop

10:04.224 --> 10:06.226
the old folks
from giving up on this place.

10:06.226 --> 10:09.028
Yeah, Gramma, the stuff
in the box isn't the treasure.

10:09.028 --> 10:10.650
The farm is.

10:10.650 --> 10:12.992
Ugh, please,
this junky old house?

10:12.992 --> 10:16.366
It's better off being replaced
by a spa. For dogs.

10:16.366 --> 10:19.869
So! Back to signing
that contract.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.951
No. The kids are right.

10:21.951 --> 10:24.704
This land belongs to the Greens
now and forever!

10:24.704 --> 10:26.456
Which means
you're trespassing.

10:26.456 --> 10:27.667
That's right.

10:27.667 --> 10:29.129
-What? Ahh!
-Ah!

10:29.129 --> 10:30.590
Don! Defense mode!

10:30.590 --> 10:32.962
[whirs] You haven't seen
the last of-- ow!

10:32.962 --> 10:34.254
-And stay out!
-[laughs]

10:34.254 --> 10:36.676
We did it!
The farm is saved!

10:36.676 --> 10:40.059
Almost. There's still
one last thing we gotta do.

10:40.059 --> 10:42.142
[Cricket]
What do you think, Gramma?

10:42.142 --> 10:44.023
Looks like treasure to me.

10:46.646 --> 10:50.190
The Green family legacy
is secure once again.

10:50.190 --> 10:53.032
Hey, You guys looking
for the family treasure?

10:53.032 --> 10:54.073
Mind if I join the hunt?

10:54.073 --> 10:55.485
Sorry, Dad,
we already found it.

10:55.485 --> 10:56.826
And solved all the riddles.

10:56.826 --> 10:59.199
-The treasure was
the farm all along.
-Aw.

11:02.742 --> 11:05.585
-Hmm.
-Hiya, Gloria, whatcha doin'?

11:05.585 --> 11:07.457
Trying to figure out
how to fix this thing.

11:07.457 --> 11:08.878
I can fix it for ya.

11:08.878 --> 11:11.381
Whatcha got here is a classic
case of too many wires.

11:11.381 --> 11:13.593
A little clip-clip, snip-snip,
and we'll be good to go.

11:13.593 --> 11:15.555
No, Cricket.
That's never the problem.

11:15.555 --> 11:16.966
Ehhh...

11:16.966 --> 11:18.558
No! Cricket, stop it.

11:18.558 --> 11:20.470
Oh, I just gotta get in there.

11:20.470 --> 11:21.561
Stop it.

11:21.561 --> 11:23.263
-Just let me--
-[growls]

11:23.263 --> 11:25.435
-Gloria!
-You're gonna make it worse!

11:25.435 --> 11:26.726
[both yelp]

11:26.726 --> 11:28.308
[coughs]

11:28.308 --> 11:31.150
[groans] Cricket,
you need to listen to me.

11:31.150 --> 11:33.403
[growls]
But we're coworkers!

11:33.403 --> 11:35.315
Which means sometimes
you need to listen to<i> me.</i>

11:35.315 --> 11:37.317
I've got all sorts
of great ideas!

11:37.317 --> 11:38.408
Pfft. Like what?

11:38.408 --> 11:40.200
Well, for starters.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.781
Why do we have bagels
when we could have doughnuts?

11:41.781 --> 11:43.283
Bagels are boring.

11:43.283 --> 11:45.375
And also why do all prices
have to end in nine?.

11:45.375 --> 11:47.627
Why not end in a three?
I like three!

11:47.627 --> 11:49.999
And these weirdo paintings
of nothing should be replaced

11:49.999 --> 11:54.133
with paintings of actual things,
like dogs wearing swimsuits.

11:54.133 --> 11:55.425
[dog barks]

11:55.425 --> 11:57.427
Everyone. Likes. Dogs.

11:57.427 --> 12:00.510
Whoa, whoa, these paintings
are abstract art.

12:00.510 --> 12:03.223
Of course I wouldn't expect
you to understand it.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.144
The artist poured
their heart out,

12:05.144 --> 12:07.437
and this canvas
caught the pieces.

12:07.437 --> 12:09.439
Ew! [laughs] Gross.

12:09.439 --> 12:11.110
Ugh, whatever,
you wouldn't know good artwork

12:11.110 --> 12:12.402
if it kicked you in the butt.

12:12.402 --> 12:13.483
I'm going on break.

12:13.483 --> 12:16.115
You're in charge
until I get back.

12:16.115 --> 12:18.948
In charge, huh?

12:18.948 --> 12:20.490
Hmm.

12:20.490 --> 12:22.912
[cell phone buzzing]

12:22.912 --> 12:24.624
[sighs]
Break's over.

12:26.536 --> 12:27.627
What the--

12:27.627 --> 12:29.709
Hmm? Well hi, Gloria!

12:34.424 --> 12:35.875
What did you do?

12:35.875 --> 12:37.677
While I was in charge,
I just put

12:37.677 --> 12:39.509
one of my great ideas
into motion.

12:39.509 --> 12:42.682
M-my paintings.
You ruined my paintings.

12:42.682 --> 12:44.223
<i> Your</i> paintings?

12:44.223 --> 12:46.185
You mean the ones that have been
hanging here forever?

12:46.185 --> 12:47.437
The ones
that everybody ignored

12:47.437 --> 12:49.228
and nobody ever gives
a passing glance?

12:49.228 --> 12:52.892
And none of them have ever sold,
not even one, you painted those?

12:52.892 --> 12:56.065
Yes. I went to art school
for four years.

12:56.065 --> 12:57.657
Well, that stinks.

12:57.657 --> 12:59.569
And now instead
of this piece being about

12:59.569 --> 13:02.241
how my parakeet doesn't love me,
it's just garbage.

13:02.241 --> 13:04.073
No, it's better,
because it's still about

13:04.073 --> 13:06.956
how your bird hates you.
but now the bird's on a boat!

13:06.956 --> 13:08.668
[groans] Cricket.

13:08.668 --> 13:11.621
-Is that painting for sale?
-No, sorry. It's ruined.

13:11.621 --> 13:13.172
I'm throwing it
in the garbage.

13:13.172 --> 13:15.044
If you're throwing it away,
I'll take it.

13:15.044 --> 13:16.045
It's yours.

13:16.045 --> 13:17.507
Oh, dang, man,
that's some nice art.

13:17.507 --> 13:18.678
Bye-bye now!

13:18.678 --> 13:21.050
Wow, he actually...
liked it?

13:21.050 --> 13:22.632
I told you I have good ideas.

13:22.632 --> 13:24.304
I'd like to buy
that piece there, please.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.385
I want one, too!

13:25.385 --> 13:27.427
[all chattering]

13:30.930 --> 13:33.022
Oh, my gosh,
not a single one left!

13:33.022 --> 13:34.394
This is incredible!

13:34.394 --> 13:36.145
Cricket, I think
we're on to something.

13:36.145 --> 13:38.568
Sure, it's a bit demoralizing
to need the artistic skill

13:38.568 --> 13:40.650
of an untrained child
to sell my artwork,

13:40.650 --> 13:42.742
but if that's what it takes,
then so be it!

13:42.742 --> 13:45.535
If we keep this up,
we could really be somebody.

13:45.535 --> 13:46.996
We might even make
a little money.

13:46.996 --> 13:48.618
Yes, please.

13:48.618 --> 13:50.660
Hey, you guys have any more
of those awesome paintings?.

13:50.660 --> 13:52.582
[both] Mmm?

13:52.582 --> 13:56.255
Well, I guess
we could make more.

13:56.255 --> 13:58.918
So you<i> don't</i> have
any more paintings?

13:59.919 --> 14:03.723
[all chattering]

14:03.723 --> 14:06.135
[both humming happily]

14:06.135 --> 14:07.427
[both] Ugh!

14:07.427 --> 14:09.138
[both chuckle]

14:09.138 --> 14:12.231
-Oh, wow, what's going on here?
-Oh, hey, dad.

14:12.231 --> 14:14.524
I thought your shift here
was finished hours ago.

14:14.524 --> 14:15.605
What have you been up to?

14:15.605 --> 14:17.977
We're making abstract art,
Mr. Green.

14:17.977 --> 14:20.029
I take all my feelings
and my hopes and dreams

14:20.029 --> 14:22.902
and failures and insecurities
and emptiness and loneliness

14:22.902 --> 14:24.984
and darkness and endless
trying to no avail

14:24.984 --> 14:27.326
-and dreams being crushed.
-Uhh...

14:27.326 --> 14:30.410
I put all that onto a canvas
and hope people get it.

14:30.410 --> 14:32.041
And that's when I come in
and draw something

14:32.041 --> 14:34.794
-people actually care about.
Oh! [laughs]

14:34.794 --> 14:37.757
Great job, Cricket.
Everyone likes dinosaurs.

14:37.757 --> 14:40.379
Well, you kids have fun.
I'll just get a drink and go.

14:40.379 --> 14:41.591
He's a good man.

14:41.591 --> 14:43.503
-Hmm, let's see here.
-Ready to order?

14:43.503 --> 14:45.094
Tilly,
what are you doing here?

14:45.094 --> 14:46.886
I'm helping out
while the artists are busy

14:46.886 --> 14:48.678
making beautiful,
majestic art.

14:50.470 --> 14:53.312
Well, in that case,
one coffee for Bill, please.

14:53.312 --> 14:56.476
Coffee for Bill?
Is there a Bill here?

14:56.476 --> 14:58.187
Tilly,<i> my</i> name is Bill.

14:58.187 --> 15:00.279
Here you go, Papa.
Freshly brewed.

15:00.279 --> 15:04.153
Aw, thanks, sweetie.
Uh, Tilly, what is this?

15:04.153 --> 15:06.285
It's skim milk
and gummy bears.

15:06.285 --> 15:08.868
I haven't completed
the employee training yet.

15:08.868 --> 15:11.581
Okay, well,
you gave it your best shot.

15:11.581 --> 15:13.833
Mmm! So good.

15:13.833 --> 15:15.795
I can tell
you're not drinkin' it.

15:15.795 --> 15:17.036
Come on, give it a try.

15:17.036 --> 15:19.378
[chuckles]
Well, all right.

15:19.378 --> 15:21.210
[slurps, chokes]

15:21.210 --> 15:22.842
Go on, drink the whole thing.

15:22.842 --> 15:24.804
[gulping]

15:24.804 --> 15:25.805
All of it.

15:27.847 --> 15:29.809
-[shudders]
-Good.

15:29.809 --> 15:32.512
-Can I get you anything else?
-I'm good.

15:32.512 --> 15:34.604
-Hey, dude, I'll be right back.
-Hmm.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.357
[gasps] Magnificent!

15:38.357 --> 15:40.610
Can't get
the perspective right.

15:40.610 --> 15:42.482
-Pardon me.
-[yelps]

15:42.482 --> 15:44.153
I just want to get
a closer look.

15:44.153 --> 15:47.406
Hmm, feelings of abandonment
and nostalgia

15:47.406 --> 15:50.069
mixed with industrial
progression.

15:50.069 --> 15:53.032
-Yeah, plus trains are neat!
-Indeed.

15:53.032 --> 15:55.535
Young man,
my name is Vuka Vukojevich

15:55.535 --> 15:57.286
of Vuka Vukojevich Galleries.

15:57.286 --> 15:59.338
Art lady.

15:59.338 --> 16:02.842
Yes. Well, your art
is very thought-provoking.

16:02.842 --> 16:05.925
Thanks. I just like to draw
stuff that looks like stuff.

16:05.925 --> 16:09.719
Like this one, I call it
"Bird Eating a Squirrel."

16:09.719 --> 16:11.050
I like that bird.

16:11.050 --> 16:13.723
Art imitating life.
Brilliant.

16:13.723 --> 16:15.975
Little boy, you paint
all these all by yourself?

16:15.975 --> 16:18.808
Hmm, yeah.
Yeah, basically.

16:18.808 --> 16:21.901
Well, in that case, here is
the address of my gallery.

16:21.901 --> 16:23.863
I want to feature
your artwork there tonight.

16:23.863 --> 16:25.905
Ooh! Okay.

16:25.905 --> 16:29.028
And here is address of barber.
Please fix hair.

16:29.028 --> 16:30.239
Hmm.

16:30.239 --> 16:34.203
See you at the gallery.
I'm going to make you a star.

16:34.203 --> 16:35.535
Wow.

16:35.535 --> 16:37.416
Hey, Cricket,
what was that about?

16:37.416 --> 16:40.379
Oh, just some fancy art lady
wants to put my artwork

16:40.379 --> 16:44.043
in a show and sell them
and make me rich and famous.

16:44.043 --> 16:48.968
[gasps] Vuka Vukojevich?!
Vuka wants to show our art?

16:48.968 --> 16:50.840
Heh, well, she's obviously
responding

16:50.840 --> 16:53.893
-to<i> my</i> part of "our" artwork.
-What are you saying?

16:53.893 --> 16:55.975
It's pretty clear folks
didn't like your paintings

16:55.975 --> 16:57.516
until I added my drawings.

16:57.516 --> 17:00.229
So I think I can do
this whole art thing on my own.

17:00.229 --> 17:02.351
I know what people want,
and they want me.

17:02.351 --> 17:03.813
That's ridiculous.

17:03.813 --> 17:07.026
Without my additions,
you just have scribbles.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.859
Scribbles? How dare you?
They're obviously doodles.

17:09.859 --> 17:11.701
How about you come
to the gallery later?

17:11.701 --> 17:12.862
You'll be singin'
a different tune

17:12.862 --> 17:14.614
when I sell oodles
of my doodles.

17:14.614 --> 17:17.827
Oh, I'll be there all right.
To watch you fail!

17:17.827 --> 17:20.499
[clears throat] Well, sorry,
Gloria, I need to split.

17:20.499 --> 17:22.662
After all, I have a gallery
to prepare for.

17:22.662 --> 17:24.924
-[door opens]
-[growls]

17:24.924 --> 17:27.967
You look stressed.
This one's on the house.

17:27.967 --> 17:30.429
[Cricket]
All right, Cricket, time to get
fancy for this art show.

17:30.429 --> 17:32.301
I don't need
no stinkin' barber.

17:34.093 --> 17:36.766
Ar-teest. [burbles]

17:36.766 --> 17:38.598
Remember, Cricket,
if you see any paintings

17:38.598 --> 17:42.351
of naked people, don't laugh
no matter<i> how</i> naked they are.

17:42.351 --> 17:45.024
[electronic music playing]

17:45.024 --> 17:46.986
Step right up,
artsy art patrons.

17:46.986 --> 17:50.069
See the genius work
of child prodigy Cricket Green!

17:50.069 --> 17:53.112
[growls]

17:53.112 --> 17:55.364
We got planes!
We got trains!

17:55.364 --> 17:57.657
Let me guess, sir,
you like dinosaurs.

17:57.657 --> 17:59.659
Hmm...

17:59.659 --> 18:01.000
nah.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.542
Huh? Well, somebody's
got questionable taste.

18:03.542 --> 18:06.045
-Beautiful work, really.
-Thank you.

18:06.045 --> 18:08.628
You've validated me as an artist
by buying my painting.

18:11.550 --> 18:12.551
Huh?

18:16.095 --> 18:18.848
None of my art's selling.
What the heck is going on?

18:18.848 --> 18:20.519
Young man, what is this?

18:20.519 --> 18:22.812
Where are the paintings
from where I had stale scone?

18:22.812 --> 18:24.273
Oh, these are them
but better.

18:24.273 --> 18:26.986
I fixed 'em up and got rid
of those pointless blotches.

18:26.986 --> 18:29.318
-Now they're just my doodles.
-That was mistake.

18:29.318 --> 18:31.991
The only thing worse
than these childish renderings

18:31.991 --> 18:33.653
is your hair.

18:33.653 --> 18:35.945
[laughs nervously]
Oh, yeah, well.

18:35.945 --> 18:39.158
I bet I can sell some art
to the next person I see.

18:39.158 --> 18:41.410
Uh, you two, I can already tell
you're gonna be

18:41.410 --> 18:44.293
walkin' out of here with
a doodle by yours truly.

18:44.293 --> 18:46.005
Perhaps one
of my self portraits.

18:46.005 --> 18:48.417
[breathing heavily]

18:48.417 --> 18:50.840
[groans] No.

18:50.840 --> 18:53.012
No, wait,
I've got plenty of others.

18:53.012 --> 18:55.214
You are a disappointment,
farm boy.

18:55.214 --> 18:57.887
But I-- [groans]
Double dang-it.

18:57.887 --> 19:01.260
Hey, Cricket,
not as easy as you thought, huh?

19:01.260 --> 19:02.391
Keep 'em coming.

19:02.391 --> 19:03.643
[sighs]

19:05.855 --> 19:08.267
I think people hate
my doodles.

19:08.267 --> 19:11.360
Yep. The art world's
a cruel place.

19:11.360 --> 19:13.232
It'll chew you up
and spit you out.

19:13.232 --> 19:14.573
[coughs]

19:14.573 --> 19:17.236
Wait a second,
I couldn't sell anything.

19:17.236 --> 19:19.118
Just like you.

19:19.118 --> 19:20.579
Uh, rude.

19:20.579 --> 19:22.581
No, no, no, I mean,
we had something

19:22.581 --> 19:24.243
when we worked together,
but I squandered it.

19:24.243 --> 19:25.244
I squandered it!

19:25.244 --> 19:27.126
We should go back
to being a team.

19:27.126 --> 19:28.377
We could sell these paintings,

19:28.377 --> 19:30.209
and you could make
a good impression on Vuka.

19:30.209 --> 19:31.921
That is of course,
if you'd be willing

19:31.921 --> 19:33.212
to work with me again.

19:36.215 --> 19:38.217
Let's do it.
You got any paints?

19:38.217 --> 19:39.558
Just leave it to me.

19:39.558 --> 19:41.761
Also, please don't touch
my hair ever again.

19:41.761 --> 19:43.472
Sir, would you like
some hors d'oeuvres?

19:43.472 --> 19:44.804
I would! [grunts]

19:44.804 --> 19:46.105
[chuckles]

19:46.105 --> 19:47.767
[grunting and clattering]

19:47.767 --> 19:49.648
-Gloria!
-Huh?

19:49.648 --> 19:53.773
The time has come to art
like you've never arted before!

19:53.773 --> 19:57.116
Over here, Gloria.
Add some abstract here.

19:57.116 --> 20:00.449
-[both grunt]
-Now on this corner! Yeah!

20:00.449 --> 20:02.742
Hmm, so complex and yet...

20:02.742 --> 20:03.993
So simple.

20:03.993 --> 20:05.034
[both] I'll take it.

20:05.034 --> 20:07.456
Sold! Sold!

20:07.456 --> 20:09.628
Gloria!
Release your muse on these!

20:09.628 --> 20:11.380
Ha ha!

20:14.173 --> 20:16.545
Gloria, you're on fire!

20:16.545 --> 20:17.717
-Ha!
-Yes!

20:17.717 --> 20:19.468
-Hah!
-Magnificent!

20:19.468 --> 20:21.220
-Ha ha!
-Mwah!

20:21.220 --> 20:23.843
Ha ha ha! [grunts]

20:25.765 --> 20:29.398
Excuse me,
what is it you are doing?!

20:29.398 --> 20:32.351
Uh, art? As a gallery owner,
seems like you'd know that.

20:32.351 --> 20:34.403
Vuka, I am so sorry.

20:34.403 --> 20:36.736
I was just so inspired
that I got carried away.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.859
I am so honored to have my work
featured in your gallery.

20:39.859 --> 20:42.992
So whaddya think, Vuka?
We make a pretty good team, huh?

20:42.992 --> 20:44.363
[growls]

20:44.363 --> 20:48.037
What's wrong?
Did we not do... a good?

20:48.037 --> 20:51.791
Sure, your pieces sold,
but I'll be keeping your profits

20:51.791 --> 20:54.463
because you've ruined
the entire gallery!

20:54.463 --> 20:56.756
-Oh! It's hideous.
-Who would do this?!

20:56.756 --> 20:59.048
This wasn't my vision at all!

20:59.048 --> 21:01.931
Someone censored my art!

21:01.931 --> 21:05.514
But it was so... funny.

21:05.514 --> 21:07.266
Ha! It<i> is</i> funny.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.647
Get out.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.893
Sorry, Gloria.
That could've gone better.

21:13.893 --> 21:15.484
No,
I don't think it could've.

21:15.484 --> 21:19.158
For the first time in years,
I felt alive as an artist.

21:19.158 --> 21:21.400
And you know,
we<i> do</i> make a pretty good team.

21:21.400 --> 21:24.243
Just a couple of ar-teests.

21:24.243 --> 21:26.866
[laughs] You look dumb.

21:26.866 --> 21:28.958
