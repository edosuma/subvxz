00:18.852 --> 00:20.683
It's alive!

00:39.039 --> 00:41.803
I just can't do a thing with it.

00:43.810 --> 00:46.278
Hey, guys, going on a mission?
Can I come?

00:46.312 --> 00:49.713
Sorry, Snow Job.
This mission doesn't require skis.

00:49.749 --> 00:53.310
Wearing a blindingly white outfit
in the middle of jungle warfare...

00:53.353 --> 00:56.379
makes you
a very shootable target, man.

00:56.423 --> 00:58.448
Bunch of G.I. Jerks!

00:58.491 --> 01:03.087
Those guys suck. Someday
I'll show them how much I rock.

01:03.129 --> 01:04.926
Attention, G.I. Joe!

01:04.964 --> 01:07.865
I am Samuel Schmid,
President of Switzerland.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.495
The Swiss Alps,
they have been overrun by Yeti!

01:10.537 --> 01:12.767
- Just one Yeti?
- Yeti, yetis...

01:12.806 --> 01:15.070
whatever the plural is!
We need your help!

01:15.108 --> 01:17.508
Sounds like a go job for Snow Job!

01:17.544 --> 01:19.978
- That's awful.
- Yeah, I gotta work on that.

01:27.320 --> 01:31.586
This must be the Swiss Capitol building.
But I don't see any Yeti.

01:31.624 --> 01:34.525
Yetis. Yeti?
I don't see anyone!

01:36.329 --> 01:37.694
What?

01:41.734 --> 01:46.068
- Snow Job, you idiot.
- Snow Job, you'll believe anything!

01:46.106 --> 01:47.095
Retard!

01:49.209 --> 01:51.871
Soldier, sorry about that practical joke.

01:51.911 --> 01:53.742
Please forgive us, Snowy Dealings.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.645
We were careless with your feelings.

01:55.682 --> 01:58.947
- Whatever. I don't care.
- Did you see? It's snowing outside!

01:58.985 --> 02:01.647
- Really?!
- Yep. We have a mission for you.

02:01.688 --> 02:02.677
Awesome!

02:03.690 --> 02:05.851
Son of a bitch!

02:06.292 --> 02:08.624
Now just hold still.
This won't hurt...

02:13.500 --> 02:14.489
Guys?

02:14.534 --> 02:19.267
I don't think that flying monkey
road kill is sitting so well.

02:36.956 --> 02:39.322
So how long have you two been?

02:39.359 --> 02:40.792
A while, OK?

02:43.229 --> 02:45.288
You're a big hand now, Thing.

02:45.331 --> 02:47.799
I think it's time you went
and made it on your own.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.859
I'm sorry, Thing, old man.

02:57.577 --> 03:01.707
I've got to hand it to you, Mr. Thing,
your resume is very impressive.

03:01.748 --> 03:04.512
Massage therapy, palm reading,
ensemble in Annie.

03:04.551 --> 03:06.678
Well, I'm willing
to give you a shot, kid.

03:08.188 --> 03:12.750
Hey, Thing.
Let me introduce Allison from accounting.

03:12.792 --> 03:16.694
She needs a ride home tonight,
if you can handle it.

03:18.198 --> 03:21.964
Oh, Thing!
Oh, Thing!

03:22.001 --> 03:25.334
It's not you, Thing, it's me.
I want to have children someday...

03:25.371 --> 03:28.704
and you don't have reproductive organs.
I'm sorry.

03:50.096 --> 03:54.396
Hey, Thing. Sorry
things didn't work out with Allison.

03:54.434 --> 03:56.425
No pun intended.

03:56.469 --> 03:59.666
But I'd like to introduce you
to the new girl from accounting.

03:59.706 --> 04:02.072
Thing, Emma Jig.

04:06.446 --> 04:10.212
Thing, Emma Jig,
I now pronounce you hand and hand.

04:13.152 --> 04:16.279
How are they going to, you know, do it?

04:16.322 --> 04:18.153
¤ Get funky with your fingers ¤

04:18.190 --> 04:20.351
¤ Funky with your fingers ¤

04:20.392 --> 04:22.588
¤ Baby, funky with your fingers ¤

04:41.247 --> 04:44.580
What are you supposed to be?
A leprechaun or something?

04:44.617 --> 04:47.950
Sure, you got that right, lad.
One of the wee folk!

04:47.987 --> 04:51.184
A natural-born
son of beautiful mother Ireland.

04:52.191 --> 04:53.783
OK.

04:53.826 --> 04:55.987
So if I catch you,
do I get your pot of gold?

04:56.029 --> 04:59.829
Of course, me lad. A pot of gold
for anyone who can catch...

05:02.335 --> 05:05.793
Bollocks!
Bartender, another beer, if you...

05:05.838 --> 05:09.239
Check it out, guys!
It's a real live leprechaun!

05:09.275 --> 05:12.369
He's giving out real gold!
Look, I got some.

05:12.412 --> 05:13.436
Bollocks!

05:16.616 --> 05:18.675
No!

05:21.287 --> 05:23.812
- Damn that Carney!
- What are we going to do?

05:24.390 --> 05:25.982
I've got an idea.

05:30.663 --> 05:33.097
Why did I get a pot of crap?

05:33.733 --> 05:35.564
That will put an end to that.

05:36.002 --> 05:39.870
Welcome to the memory game!
Let's bring out our first contestant.

05:39.906 --> 05:44.434
Hi, I'm Charles, and I'm
from Toronto, Ontaro, Canada. Yeah!

05:44.477 --> 05:48.311
Charles, are you ready
to enter the Hall of Memory?

05:48.348 --> 05:50.407
- I am!
- Then let's play!

05:53.653 --> 05:56.349
So what am I supposed to?

05:56.389 --> 05:59.950
Too bad, Charles. All right,
let's bring out our next contestant.

05:59.992 --> 06:02.119
- Hugh!
- Hi, I'm Hugh.

06:02.161 --> 06:05.358
- And I don't want to play anymore.
- Hugh, get on in there.

06:06.232 --> 06:08.029
Way to use your memory.

06:08.067 --> 06:09.967
Hugh remembered that arrow.

06:11.003 --> 06:13.995
You've got to watch those spikes.
Here goes Martha!

06:14.040 --> 06:16.372
She ducks the arrows,
and jumps the spikes.

06:16.409 --> 06:19.845
She avoids the falling rock,
now she swings over the molten lava!

06:19.879 --> 06:21.312
There's that hidden axe!

06:21.347 --> 06:24.009
That makes fighting
that skeleton so much easier.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.813
Quickly through the poison gas.

06:26.452 --> 06:28.477
And she's over
those pesky saw blades!

06:28.521 --> 06:31.081
She eats the brownie
that's not filled with laxative.

06:31.124 --> 06:35.220
And she's over to the giant piano!
Greensleeves, that's it!

06:35.261 --> 06:39.197
- She's done it!
- I did it, I did it! Yeah!

06:39.232 --> 06:43.896
Congratulations, Martha!
Are you ready to collect your prize?

06:43.936 --> 06:45.096
Yes, I am!

06:45.138 --> 06:47.197
Great! It's right over there!

06:48.608 --> 06:51.771
What's wrong?
Go on, claim your prize.

06:51.811 --> 06:53.301
I... OK!

06:54.280 --> 06:56.771
Now you just have to escape with it!

06:56.816 --> 06:57.805
What?

07:04.624 --> 07:08.355
A black stallion!
What a beautiful horse!

07:08.394 --> 07:10.589
- Wassup, son?
- You can talk?!

07:10.630 --> 07:13.793
You think because I'm a "black" stallion
that I can't talk?

07:13.833 --> 07:16.563
You think I'm stupid
or uneducated or something?

07:16.602 --> 07:19.696
No, it's just horses don't usually...

07:19.739 --> 07:21.866
Racist!

07:27.914 --> 07:30.974
Look, Black Stallion!
I caught a wild rooster!

07:31.017 --> 07:33.781
Well, about damn time!
I'm starving up in this mug, man.

07:33.820 --> 07:34.980
Should I fry it up?

07:35.021 --> 07:38.422
You think 'cause I'm a "black" stallion
that I like fried chicken.

07:38.458 --> 07:42.622
Yes, massa! Yeah!
Can I get me some fried chicken, please?

07:43.663 --> 07:47.258
What? No, no! I just...
No, I mean, I meant...

07:49.502 --> 07:51.265
- Never mind.
- Racist.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.762
Black Stallion, I found
a source of fresh water!

07:54.807 --> 07:57.742
That's not the Black Stallion.
I'm the Black Stallion!

07:57.777 --> 08:00.268
What, you think
all black horses look the same?

08:00.313 --> 08:04.545
We all just one big race
of black stallions to you, aren't we?

08:04.584 --> 08:06.643
No, I just...
I thought there were...

08:06.686 --> 08:11.282
- You probably can't even dance, honky.
- I can too dance! Watch!

08:25.872 --> 08:26.861
Snap!

08:26.906 --> 08:28.203
See, Black Stallion?

08:28.241 --> 08:31.335
We both have misconceptions
and misunderstandings.

08:31.377 --> 08:33.345
And you can be a racist, too.

08:33.379 --> 08:35.813
Little white boy,
you have taught me a lot...

08:35.847 --> 08:38.749
about myself and race relations.
I love you.

08:39.818 --> 08:43.152
Kids!
Come inside for hot cocoa.

08:43.188 --> 08:45.555
- Have you guys seen Billy?
- No.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.389
Detective Oprah!

08:55.434 --> 08:58.403
You're going to go
after the biggest crime boss in Chicago.

08:58.437 --> 09:02.635
So you'll need a no-nonsense partner
with a no-nonsense moustache.

09:02.675 --> 09:03.733
Meet Dr. Phil.

09:03.776 --> 09:06.040
Come on, Oprah.
It's time to get real.

09:06.078 --> 09:08.569
I'm aging too gracefully for this shit.

09:08.614 --> 09:11.139
That's the Big Boss'
right-hand man, Salvador.

09:11.183 --> 09:13.981
If I can get five million
white trash housewives...

09:14.020 --> 09:16.580
to read War and Peace,
I can get this guy to talk.

09:16.622 --> 09:19.557
Let me try something, Oprah.
Hey, listen, Salvador?

09:19.592 --> 09:23.585
You show eight out of nine signs
of being a criminal psychopath.

09:23.629 --> 09:26.598
But a new day is just
waiting around the corner.

09:26.632 --> 09:29.192
We'll be right back
after this commercial...

09:29.235 --> 09:31.897
Who the fuck are you?
And what the fuck did you just say?

09:31.938 --> 09:33.803
I think he's really opening up.

09:33.839 --> 09:36.330
Yeah, opening up
a can of whoop-ass!

09:36.375 --> 09:38.343
Salvador, I think a lot of this anger...

09:38.377 --> 09:41.073
is stemming
from the relationship with your father.

09:41.113 --> 09:43.604
I'd like to bring him out here.
Come on out, dad.

09:43.649 --> 09:45.879
Papa?! How did you?

09:45.918 --> 09:48.944
But you don't have enough
money to fly from Italy.

09:48.988 --> 09:52.151
All guests of The Oprah Winfrey Show
fly first class on Delta Airlines.

09:52.191 --> 09:55.558
Papa! Papa!

09:56.662 --> 09:57.720
Take 'em down!

10:01.267 --> 10:02.632
If you rat on your boss...

10:02.668 --> 10:06.263
we'll give you a 64-inch high definition
plasma TV from Samsung.

10:06.305 --> 10:08.500
That's just
a refurbished floor model!

10:08.541 --> 10:11.305
- You go to hell!
- Tell me about your childhood.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.539
Did someone touch you as a kid?

10:13.579 --> 10:16.742
That is wrong,
but it's not your fault.

10:16.782 --> 10:19.148
I care about you.

10:19.185 --> 10:21.983
The boss, he hangs out
behind the bowling alley.

10:22.021 --> 10:23.215
Book 'em, Oprah!

10:23.255 --> 10:25.723
Time for you fools
to join my Book Club.

10:25.758 --> 10:28.124
The first book
is a story about a sucker.

10:28.160 --> 10:30.822
Oprah, I'm already
a member of your book...

10:30.863 --> 10:32.524
I would love to kick your ass!

10:32.565 --> 10:33.554
Stay back!

10:33.599 --> 10:36.397
I don't trust you cops
further than I could throw you.

10:36.435 --> 10:38.733
Well, then, let's try a trust exercise.

10:38.771 --> 10:42.798
You fall back into my arms.
Trust me, I won't harm you.

10:42.842 --> 10:43.968
OK.

10:44.010 --> 10:45.841
But they will.

10:47.079 --> 10:50.480
You may have caught me but
you have no proof I ever killed anybody.

10:50.516 --> 10:52.780
Yeah? Look under your chair.

10:59.291 --> 11:00.986
In hindsight, that was a mistake.

11:01.027 --> 11:03.257
Well, you're right, Oprah.
You always are.
