00:23.214 --> 00:26.145
<i> From a weird reverie</i>
<i> of dark revelation,</i>

00:26.181 --> 00:29.719
<i> Mr Grubb woke up with</i>
<i> a strange sensation.</i>

00:29.754 --> 00:32.779
<i> Slipping out through the crack</i>
<i> at the back of the lair,</i>

00:32.814 --> 00:36.219
<i> trudging out through the muck</i>
<i> and the thick, misted air,</i>

00:36.254 --> 00:39.739
<i> where the collywobblers</i>
<i> warbled their sinister call</i>

00:39.774 --> 00:43.879
<i> and the dinglebaggles scurried</i>
<i> on jittery claws,</i>

00:43.914 --> 00:46.905
<i> his ghostly breath</i>
<i> mixing in with the fog,</i>

00:46.941 --> 00:50.785
<i> he plonked himself down</i>
<i> on a damp, mossy log.</i>

00:50.821 --> 00:53.992
<i> But then in the sludge,</i>
<i> just a few feet away,</i>

00:54.028 --> 00:58.585
<i> Mr Grubb saw a plant</i>
<i> that was quite out of place.</i>

00:58.621 --> 01:03.392
<i> A single buttercup</i>
<i> in a pile of faeces.</i>

01:03.427 --> 01:07.519
<i> Mr Grubb tore it up</i>
<i> into a thousand pieces.</i>

01:13.488 --> 01:15.079
For fuck's sake.

02:22.281 --> 02:23.432
Here we go.
Morning!

02:23.467 --> 02:26.392
Hard-working boys.
That's what I like to see.

02:26.427 --> 02:27.952
Brought us a nice brew,
Mrs Flower?

02:27.987 --> 02:30.479
Cheeky,
what makes you say that?

02:32.354 --> 02:34.926
Yes, I have,
you little sneaks.

02:34.961 --> 02:36.912
Thanks, Mrs Flower. Nice.

02:36.948 --> 02:37.552
Morning, Deborah.

02:37.587 --> 02:39.632
Gosh, you're like
a pack of wolves.

02:39.668 --> 02:40.679
Morning, Deborah.

02:41.314 --> 02:42.192
Morning, Barry.

02:42.227 --> 02:44.772
Tommy, haven't you
got big hands.

02:44.807 --> 02:46.779
You look radiant
this morning.

02:46.814 --> 02:49.519
Come on, young Ryan,
so handsome.

02:51.527 --> 02:53.066
So, she's got you
building a wall now.

02:53.101 --> 02:55.119
Yeah, it doesn't seem
necessary to me, personally.

02:55.154 --> 02:56.905
But what Mrs Beckett wants,
Mrs Beckett gets.

02:56.941 --> 03:00.219
Why has she got you
to start it right here,
right next to our garden?

03:00.254 --> 03:03.352
We don't make the decisions.
We just do as she says.

03:03.387 --> 03:04.959
Dredge the pond,
kill the chickens...

03:04.994 --> 03:07.185
Okay, well, nice to
see you boys, bye-bye.

03:07.221 --> 03:08.572
Lovely cakes,
Mrs Flower.

03:08.608 --> 03:11.879
Filthy. I'll have to take
out a restraining order.

03:11.914 --> 03:13.519
See you later.

03:16.708 --> 03:17.679
Big pile of wood.

03:18.754 --> 03:19.279
Blood.

03:19.314 --> 03:22.159
Are you all right,
Deborah?

03:25.601 --> 03:28.052
Way too morose.
<i> Yeah, I mean, it's for kids.</i>

03:28.087 --> 03:30.112
I understand.
It is for kids, yes.

03:30.114 --> 03:31.726
I'll lighten up chapter one,

03:31.761 --> 03:34.852
and maybe the fart
pigeons are better than
the collywobblers, yeah.

03:34.888 --> 03:35.592
<i> How's Shun?</i>

03:35.628 --> 03:37.185
Shun has been getting on
with the illustrations, yes.

03:37.221 --> 03:38.912
And, as I say,
obviously, I do have a plot,

03:38.947 --> 03:42.972
it's just when you
suddenly say,
"Can you tell me what it is?"

03:43.008 --> 03:44.912
<i> I need to see something</i>
<i> by next week.</i>

03:44.914 --> 03:47.712
Next week?
Not a problem.

03:47.748 --> 03:48.485
<i> Okay.</i>
Okay.

03:48.521 --> 03:50.846
<i> Bye.</i>
Yeah, thanks for your help.

03:50.881 --> 03:51.879
<i> Thanks. Bye.</i>
Bye.

03:54.594 --> 03:58.186
Mr Flowers.
Thank you, Shun.

03:58.221 --> 03:59.545
You don't have to bow.

03:59.581 --> 04:00.599
Miso soup.

04:01.128 --> 04:02.359
Me so grateful.

04:07.368 --> 04:09.806
Very good. Very powerful.

04:09.841 --> 04:11.459
Yes. Idea for comic book.

04:11.494 --> 04:14.766
Tarantula Woman.
Tarantula Woman.

04:14.801 --> 04:16.679
Mr Gay.
Mr Gay.

04:17.774 --> 04:19.372
And that's his erection?

04:19.408 --> 04:22.219
Yes, of course,
Mr Gay is always
have erection.

04:22.254 --> 04:24.666
His weakness, actually.
Very sensitive.

04:24.701 --> 04:28.966
Tarantula Woman
is try have sex
with a lot of gay guy.

04:29.001 --> 04:29.686
Mr Gay protect.

04:29.721 --> 04:34.145
"Go away, Tarantula Woman!
Have sex with hetero guy!

04:34.181 --> 04:35.439
"Gay power!"

04:35.474 --> 04:37.532
Gay power.
Good morning!

04:37.568 --> 04:38.999
Mrs Flowers.

04:39.034 --> 04:41.106
Hello, Shun.
Yes, exactly.

04:41.141 --> 04:42.692
Mrs Flowers, your leg!

04:42.728 --> 04:45.706
Please don't mind.
Can I have a word?
Please. Please.

04:45.741 --> 04:46.419
Yeah.
Thank you.

04:46.454 --> 04:48.899
Probably she has to
take a magic potion

04:48.934 --> 04:51.846
for make fantastic
face so beautiful.

04:51.881 --> 04:53.265
Thank you, Shun.

04:53.301 --> 04:56.452
Actually,
don't worry about that.

04:56.488 --> 04:57.005
No problem.

04:57.041 --> 05:00.759
Leg so big, Mrs Flowers.
Strong!

05:01.454 --> 05:02.445
Very big leg.

05:02.481 --> 05:04.966
Thank you, sorry.
Actually, do you mind?

05:05.001 --> 05:06.199
No problem.

05:06.987 --> 05:10.806
No. Do you mind?
As in, leaving?

05:10.841 --> 05:11.405
All finished.

05:11.441 --> 05:14.886
I will make food
for anniversary!

05:14.921 --> 05:16.305
Very delicious,
very clever.

05:16.341 --> 05:18.119
Good luck.
See you in a mo.

05:18.154 --> 05:19.952
Thank you.
Yes, in a mo, that's right.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.659
His English is
coming on, isn't it?
Yeah.

05:21.694 --> 05:24.279
Let's go!
Anniversary party!

05:25.754 --> 05:30.239
It's lovely that you two
are such good friends.

05:32.141 --> 05:33.492
Happy anniversary.

05:33.527 --> 05:36.112
Yes, happy anniversary
to you, too.

05:36.114 --> 05:37.572
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about,
actually.

05:37.608 --> 05:41.372
I assume we won't be
going ahead with the party,
now that no one is coming.

05:41.408 --> 05:41.879
Actually, I was thinking,

05:41.914 --> 05:43.632
and it's no big deal,
obviously, but there are

05:43.667 --> 05:46.246
still some people
we haven't asked yet.

05:46.281 --> 05:47.399
The Becketts, for example.

05:47.434 --> 05:48.932
The Becketts are racists.

05:48.968 --> 05:53.599
Or Martin then,
or that man, Bill,
who used to come around.

05:54.661 --> 05:56.379
Bill.

05:56.414 --> 05:56.819
The postman?

05:56.854 --> 05:58.392
Yes, he was the postman,
wasn't he? You're right.

05:58.394 --> 06:01.152
I think so, yeah.
I just thought we
should try to...

06:01.188 --> 06:03.252
I mean, for the twins,
or for your mother's sake.

06:03.288 --> 06:06.579
My mother thinks
everyone is a plumber
called James.

06:06.614 --> 06:08.052
So you're saying
you'd prefer not to bother.

06:08.088 --> 06:09.859
No, I'm just saying
that it might be
overall less stressful

06:09.894 --> 06:13.946
if we didn't invite some
racists and a postman
to our house.

06:13.981 --> 06:15.179
So you'd prefer not to?

06:15.214 --> 06:15.986
I'm not saying that.

06:16.021 --> 06:17.592
We've done such a good job
with the twins, haven't we?

06:17.627 --> 06:21.332
I mean, it's a good sign they
still want to live at home
even though they're 25.

06:21.367 --> 06:23.192
I mean, we're good parents,
aren't we?

06:23.228 --> 06:23.592
Yes. Yes, we are.

06:23.627 --> 06:27.519
I, for one, am very happy
with our sexual freedom
that we both have.

06:27.554 --> 06:30.686
And, I mean, I'm really
making the most of it.

06:30.721 --> 06:32.219
Seriously "for," you know.

06:32.254 --> 06:35.912
We don't want
to be too happy.
We're not mad.

06:35.914 --> 06:38.446
But, you know,
on the other hand,

06:38.481 --> 06:44.439
also, you can't have
too much of a good thing,
by which I mean joy.

06:48.354 --> 06:51.826
So you want me to see
who else is around
who we missed out?

06:51.861 --> 06:52.752
Thank you, Maurice.

06:52.788 --> 06:55.919
And I know we don't usually,
but I thought for a change.

06:55.954 --> 06:57.012
Sorry.

06:57.048 --> 06:57.719
No, thank you.

06:57.754 --> 06:59.739
"No, thank you."
Sorry, I thought...
No.

06:59.774 --> 07:02.052
Don't apologise. Yes,
thank you for the present.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.319
I see, right.
Great.

07:03.354 --> 07:05.032
Thoughtful. Shall I?
No.

07:05.068 --> 07:08.079
Don't bother,
I'd throw it away.
It's rubbish.

07:08.808 --> 07:09.392
And a free DVD.

07:09.427 --> 07:13.599
Yeah, I thought
you'd find it funny
because of his tie.

07:14.421 --> 07:15.439
Yeah. Yeah.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.479
I hope you didn't
get me anything.

07:20.181 --> 07:22.519
No. I didn't want to...

07:25.967 --> 07:27.752
Of course
I got you something.

07:27.788 --> 07:31.319
Got you. I got you this.
Maurice, you didn't have to.

07:32.474 --> 07:34.639
Goodness.
It's for me?

07:35.467 --> 07:36.986
Yeah.

07:37.021 --> 07:37.519
Did you get Shun to...

07:37.554 --> 07:39.879
Yeah, I commissioned
Shun to do it.

07:40.627 --> 07:44.465
I like how her
breasts and his...

07:44.501 --> 07:47.759
Yeah, I thought you
might enjoy the...

07:49.414 --> 07:51.039
The penis.

07:51.074 --> 07:51.899
Yeah.

07:51.934 --> 07:53.979
Wow, and it just
goes to show

07:54.014 --> 07:55.486
what an exciting
place we're at.
Yes.

07:55.521 --> 07:57.932
You know,
that we can get each other
such challenging gifts.

07:57.968 --> 07:58.672
That's right.

07:58.708 --> 08:00.052
And it shows
how open-minded
we are about sex.

08:00.088 --> 08:03.199
Art.
Art. Art.
That's what I mean. Art.

08:03.707 --> 08:07.619
Goodness, that'll be Hugo,
he's been quite peculiar
since the divorce.

08:07.654 --> 08:11.279
Mrs Flowers!
Trombonist is here!

08:11.314 --> 08:12.879
Yes, thank you, Shun. Coming!

08:13.814 --> 08:14.419
You not like?

08:14.454 --> 08:18.559
Oh, no, I do like.
I love it.
And I love you, Shun.

08:19.714 --> 08:21.219
Do I? Yes, why not.

08:21.254 --> 08:24.399
I love you, obviously.
I make coffee!

08:36.201 --> 08:37.732
Hello, Hugo. How are we?

08:37.767 --> 08:40.239
I don't want to play
trombone, I'm sad.

08:40.274 --> 08:43.585
Oh, dear.
Well, let's try some
sight reading, shall we?

08:43.621 --> 08:45.679
See if we can
cheer you up a bit.

08:45.714 --> 08:45.939
Sorry, Deborah.

08:45.974 --> 08:50.179
No, don't worry.
He's probably just upset
about your divorce.

08:50.214 --> 08:51.399
Thanks.

08:56.001 --> 09:02.559
Abigail. Abigail.
Abigail. Abigail. Abigail!

09:03.014 --> 09:04.559
Hi, Donald.

09:04.594 --> 09:05.599
What are you doing?

09:06.608 --> 09:08.132
Going for a run.

09:08.168 --> 09:09.619
Cool. Yeah, nice one.

09:09.654 --> 09:11.879
I'm just tweaking
the design of a new invention.

09:11.914 --> 09:14.419
Then I'm heading into town
to buy shitloads of cheese.

09:14.454 --> 09:17.346
We're having a party, later,
if you want to come.

09:17.381 --> 09:18.159
Parents' anniversary.

09:18.194 --> 09:22.479
Funny coincidence,
us bumping into each other
here, don't you think?

09:22.514 --> 09:24.366
It's the third time
this week.

09:24.401 --> 09:25.719
What do you think it means?

09:27.741 --> 09:29.279
Destiny.

09:33.674 --> 09:37.359
Milk, milk, milk...

09:40.174 --> 09:40.739
Donald!

09:40.774 --> 09:43.085
High five, we are friends!
Get away from me.

09:43.121 --> 09:44.819
You should try
making a real coffee.

09:44.854 --> 09:47.192
Use my Ubercaf.
Eight times the strength

09:47.227 --> 09:50.079
of a normal coffee,
half the beans.

09:58.541 --> 09:59.519
Yeah.

10:02.514 --> 10:03.879
Gourmet.

10:03.914 --> 10:05.779
Very good, Donald.

10:05.814 --> 10:06.752
Mr Flowers.
Creamy.

10:06.787 --> 10:08.519
I'll have one of
those in a sec.

10:08.554 --> 10:10.312
You should try
my Ubercaf, Dad.

10:10.314 --> 10:13.999
Sent the design off
a few months ago,
just waiting to hear back.

10:14.034 --> 10:14.819
No, thanks, Donald.

10:14.854 --> 10:16.799
I'm just going to have
a normal coffee,
if it's all right.

10:20.734 --> 10:21.599
What's this?

10:21.634 --> 10:25.239
It's my Fromage
Fumigating Fondue Machine.

10:26.227 --> 10:30.399
Very good.
Little bit big for the table,
if you could move it.

10:35.821 --> 10:37.719
Why is the tree broken?

10:38.627 --> 10:39.719
Probably Amy
climbing up it
or something.

10:39.754 --> 10:43.952
"Look at me,
I'm in a tree, I'm so weird."
Yeah, well, guess what?

10:43.987 --> 10:46.492
You're also fat,
because the tree is broken.

10:46.527 --> 10:48.439
Can you check
she's had her breakfast?

10:48.787 --> 10:51.186
Why?
Because sometimes she forgets.

10:51.221 --> 10:52.792
Fucking nepotism.

10:52.794 --> 10:53.312
That doesn't
make sense, Donald.

10:53.347 --> 10:56.319
Well, good.
She doesn't make sense.

10:57.794 --> 10:59.519
Bloody hell, Nana.

11:00.681 --> 11:03.046
Morning.
James.

11:03.081 --> 11:04.232
How are the pipes?

11:04.268 --> 11:05.439
Fine. Thank you.

11:06.808 --> 11:10.199
Is that the dulcet tones
of Martin Webster?

11:11.248 --> 11:12.679
It isn't?

11:13.401 --> 11:14.832
Sorry.

11:14.867 --> 11:16.119
Banana.

11:19.507 --> 11:20.799
<i> Abigail.</i>

11:29.587 --> 11:30.599
<i> Abigail.</i>

11:56.068 --> 11:57.279
What are you doing?

11:58.274 --> 11:59.832
Go away.
What's that?

11:59.868 --> 12:01.359
Nothing. Go away.

12:01.781 --> 12:03.359
Godiva!

12:04.054 --> 12:05.832
Not going to work
this time, I'm afraid.

12:05.867 --> 12:08.679
I'm ready for it.
I'll punch it in the beak.

12:09.674 --> 12:11.319
Right.
I'm telling Mum and Dad.

12:11.354 --> 12:14.199
It's not appropriate
for you to have a medieval...

12:15.274 --> 12:15.992
What the fuck
are you doing?

12:16.027 --> 12:20.419
You don't shoot family!
Everyone knows that!

12:20.454 --> 12:23.739
This room is a disgrace.
Here, look.

12:23.774 --> 12:27.212
Use my mobile vacuum cleaner.
No one likes a squalid woman.

12:27.248 --> 12:29.232
You just taped a dust buster
to a toy car.

12:29.234 --> 12:31.025
Yeah, well,
it's better than
anything you could make.

12:31.061 --> 12:32.719
Why aren't you
a millionaire yet, then?

12:32.754 --> 12:35.679
Why haven't you
had your exorcism
yet then, freak?

12:41.288 --> 12:44.459
<i> Nana Grubb skulked through</i>
<i> the sludge and the dirt,</i>

12:44.494 --> 12:47.499
<i> the solitary witness</i>
<i> of Mr Grubb's hurt.</i>

12:47.534 --> 12:50.385
<i> She gathered the petals</i>
<i> and hid them from sight,</i>

12:50.421 --> 12:53.819
<i> the buttercup fragments</i>
<i> of Mr Grubb's plight.</i>

12:53.854 --> 12:56.879
<i> So Billy and Bella</i>
<i> and dear Mrs Grubb</i>

12:56.914 --> 13:00.879
<i> would not know his madness,</i>
<i> but only his love.</i>

13:01.387 --> 13:02.745
Hey, Nana.

13:02.781 --> 13:04.159
James.

13:04.687 --> 13:06.352
Come on, Hugo,
let's get out of the toilet

13:06.387 --> 13:08.659
and do a few scales
before Mommy gets back.

13:08.694 --> 13:10.212
Bad news, I'm afraid.

13:10.248 --> 13:11.672
No one's free.

13:11.708 --> 13:12.979
No, really?
Yeah.

13:13.014 --> 13:13.619
What are they all doing?

13:13.654 --> 13:15.285
Well, various things,
obviously.

13:15.321 --> 13:16.705
Well, what are
they variously doing?

13:16.741 --> 13:18.152
You want me to list
all the things
they're doing?

13:18.187 --> 13:20.146
Well, tell me
one of them at least.

13:20.181 --> 13:21.599
Martin's in a coma.

13:22.834 --> 13:24.106
Right.

13:24.141 --> 13:25.399
So, yeah.
Thank you.

13:28.801 --> 13:29.485
Let's just do it anyway.

13:29.521 --> 13:31.425
Have a party
without any guests?

13:31.461 --> 13:34.785
Well, I could ask George,
couldn't I?

13:34.821 --> 13:38.219
And Abigail.
Yes. He's very funny.

13:38.254 --> 13:40.786
Is he?
He's hilarious.

13:40.821 --> 13:41.999
And very handsome.

13:42.034 --> 13:42.645
Yeah, I suppose he is, yeah.

13:42.681 --> 13:44.479
And I could ask
the lovely builders.

13:44.514 --> 13:48.879
They're not even our builders,
so that's going to be
a bit sinister, isn't it?

13:49.321 --> 13:51.065
Well, it's all about
having fun, Maurice.

13:51.101 --> 13:53.726
We need to have fun,
it bleeds into the psyche.

13:53.761 --> 13:54.399
I mean, look.

13:54.434 --> 13:57.252
Emotional stress
and confusion and divorce.

13:57.288 --> 14:00.179
At the rate he's going,
he's going to turn out
a murderer.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.452
Or a solicitor.
So...

14:01.487 --> 14:02.699
Are we doing
all this for Hugo?

14:02.734 --> 14:03.979
No, we're not.
We're doing it for us!

14:04.014 --> 14:05.612
I'm just using
Hugo as an example

14:05.647 --> 14:07.786
of how parents can
fuck up their children.

14:07.821 --> 14:08.899
Finished.
Hello.

14:08.934 --> 14:11.945
Hugo, but that is
very naughty.

14:11.981 --> 14:13.759
But also,
I hope you're all right.

14:13.794 --> 14:15.886
Just remember,
it's not your
parents' fault.

14:15.921 --> 14:17.499
I mean, it's your fault.
No, it's not your fault.

14:17.534 --> 14:20.479
It's not your fault
that your parents...

14:22.681 --> 14:24.706
Sorry.

14:24.741 --> 14:25.406
That could be Barbara.

14:25.441 --> 14:27.505
Why don't you ask
if Barbara and Hugo
want to come tonight?

14:27.541 --> 14:28.985
It might cheer her up a bit.
Okay.

14:29.021 --> 14:31.699
And you could ask George,
as well.

14:31.734 --> 14:32.005
No, you can ask him.

14:32.041 --> 14:33.185
Sweetie, don't.
You be careful.

14:33.221 --> 14:35.159
You don't want to
lose me to him.

14:44.074 --> 14:45.052
Right.

14:45.087 --> 14:48.446
Let's clear this up,
shall we?

14:48.481 --> 14:50.032
Must have been a big poo!

14:50.067 --> 14:52.465
Looks like
a clever machine, Donald.

14:52.501 --> 14:54.719
Saying something
that makes sense
for once, Shun.

14:54.754 --> 14:56.732
It's a Fumigating
Fondue Machine,

14:56.768 --> 14:59.999
a device I've created for
smoking and melting cheese.

15:00.034 --> 15:00.979
Fondue machines already exist.

15:01.014 --> 15:03.925
Yes, but if you listen
to the actual name
of the invention

15:03.961 --> 15:06.319
instead of being
a fat pedant ignoramus,

15:06.354 --> 15:09.552
you'd notice I called it
a "Fumigating Fondue Machine,"

15:09.587 --> 15:11.592
i.e., it smokes the cheese
at the same time.

15:11.627 --> 15:13.879
Why don't you just
get smoked cheese?

15:13.914 --> 15:15.852
Let's see whose laughing
when you're stuck here

15:15.887 --> 15:17.519
writing pointless
depressing music

15:17.554 --> 15:20.612
and I've bought myself
a whole tropical island.

15:20.648 --> 15:21.326
Donald Island?

15:21.361 --> 15:23.166
That's right, Shun.
Don't think you're coming.
You're banned.

15:23.201 --> 15:25.579
We'll have our
own island anyway,
won't we, Shun?

15:25.614 --> 15:26.352
What should we call it?

15:26.387 --> 15:30.492
I think maybe
Donald Island.

15:30.528 --> 15:31.206
Fucking moron!

15:31.241 --> 15:32.979
That's it, everyone.
Getting into
the spirit of things.

15:33.014 --> 15:34.452
So, George and Abigail
are coming

15:34.487 --> 15:35.679
and I'm going to ask
the builders, too,

15:35.714 --> 15:36.939
so it should be
a lovely evening.

15:36.974 --> 15:39.192
What? Why are George
and Abigail coming?

15:39.228 --> 15:39.659
Why's he coming?

15:39.694 --> 15:41.665
George and Abigail
are coming because
they're our neighbours.

15:41.701 --> 15:44.172
And Shun is coming
because he's our...

15:44.208 --> 15:46.219
Slave.
Japanese angel.

15:46.254 --> 15:48.286
You like Abigail,
don't you, Donald?

15:48.321 --> 15:49.719
She likes me,
more like.

15:49.754 --> 15:50.359
It's embarrassing.

15:50.394 --> 15:51.912
She asked if she could
come earlier, actually.

15:51.948 --> 15:54.539
"Just play it cool, Abigail.
Stop being so keen."

15:54.574 --> 15:56.432
Well, you are quite a catch,
I must say.

15:56.467 --> 15:58.186
He looks about 40.
Well, you look dead, mate.

15:58.221 --> 16:00.532
And some of those
builder lads are
quite handsome, Amy.

16:00.568 --> 16:03.086
So, you know,
no harm in making
a bit of an effort.

16:03.121 --> 16:04.985
Also you could be
friends with Abigail, too,

16:05.021 --> 16:07.146
you know, if you just
lightened up a bit.

16:07.181 --> 16:08.079
No. She's too weird.

16:08.114 --> 16:09.845
That's why she'll die
a lonely spinster
covered in moss

16:09.881 --> 16:12.199
while I'm living it up
on Donald Island.

16:13.201 --> 16:15.146
Oh, no, no, no.

16:15.181 --> 16:16.479
Hey! Leave that alone!

16:16.514 --> 16:18.926
Hugo loves the Grubbs books.

16:18.961 --> 16:20.139
He thinks you're brilliant.

16:20.174 --> 16:22.545
Nice for him to be around
a more stable family.

16:22.581 --> 16:25.772
It's a work in progress,
you know,
but we're getting there.

16:25.807 --> 16:28.679
Come back here,
you horrid witch!

16:31.301 --> 16:33.679
Stop it!
Stop it!

16:33.714 --> 16:35.852
No, Shun! No judo!

16:35.887 --> 16:37.766
Amy!

16:37.801 --> 16:39.359
That's a valuable prototype!

16:40.707 --> 16:43.312
Donald!
What the fuck is going on?

16:43.348 --> 16:44.766
She's a psychopath!

16:44.801 --> 16:45.505
Hello, boys!

16:45.541 --> 16:49.559
What are you doing tonight?
We're going to have
a little party.

16:56.614 --> 16:59.652
Abigail, your ass
looks outstanding.

16:59.688 --> 17:01.279
Shut up, Dad.

17:03.781 --> 17:04.879
Hooray!

17:04.914 --> 17:06.325
Hello, Deborah.

17:06.361 --> 17:07.579
Hello.

17:07.614 --> 17:08.119
Steady on.

17:08.154 --> 17:10.385
You know
I can't control myself
around you, Deborah.

17:10.421 --> 17:13.592
The sexual tension
is just unbearable.

17:13.628 --> 17:14.672
Hi, Deborah.
Hi.

17:14.707 --> 17:16.792
He's hilarious,
your dad, isn't he?

17:16.828 --> 17:17.839
Donald's inside.

17:18.687 --> 17:19.919
I was given
a whole crate of this

17:19.954 --> 17:22.819
as a thank you
for a new forehead.

17:22.854 --> 17:24.519
New forehead. Fancy.

17:26.448 --> 17:28.199
That could be me and you.

17:29.101 --> 17:32.159
Hilarious. It's a present,
actually, from Maurice.

17:33.614 --> 17:33.952
What are you cooking?

17:33.987 --> 17:37.112
That's just
Donald's special cheese.

17:37.148 --> 17:38.799
Smells like shit.

17:40.714 --> 17:42.385
So, everyone, this is George.
He's a plastic surgeon.

17:42.421 --> 17:46.672
And his daughter, Abigail,
who is training to be
a very clever lawyer.

17:46.707 --> 17:49.179
Abigail.
That's her real face.

17:49.214 --> 17:50.399
I haven't touched it.

17:54.294 --> 17:56.719
Maurice, how are you?

17:56.754 --> 17:57.759
Yeah.

17:59.268 --> 18:01.452
It's a bit quiet, isn't it?
Shall I get some music?

18:01.488 --> 18:04.112
I can go and get
some of my tapes,
if you like.

18:04.114 --> 18:06.519
No, Barry.
Don't want more jazz.

18:08.007 --> 18:10.479
Perhaps Amy could
play something.

18:10.874 --> 18:12.639
Dad.

18:12.674 --> 18:13.679
Could be nice.

18:16.034 --> 18:16.785
Okay, something lively, maybe.

18:16.821 --> 18:17.859
I don't know
about everybody else,

18:17.894 --> 18:20.399
but I'm in the mood
for a bloody boogie.

18:35.394 --> 18:36.352
Boring!

18:36.387 --> 18:39.279
Play some reggae,
for heaven's sake!

18:40.714 --> 18:42.359
This is a jerky
made of beef.

18:42.394 --> 18:45.545
Not now, thank you, Shun.
We're just drinking.

18:45.581 --> 18:46.812
Thank you.

18:46.848 --> 18:47.152
Congratulation.

18:47.187 --> 18:50.032
Have you ever had
smoked cheese before?

18:50.067 --> 18:51.319
No.
No?

18:51.354 --> 18:52.639
I put a bit of gin in there.

18:56.641 --> 18:58.559
Hello.
Hello.

19:04.767 --> 19:09.399
Let's get rid of this,
shall we, James?

19:10.928 --> 19:14.585
Maurice, shall we
get your mother down?
She loves a party.

19:14.621 --> 19:16.839
Deborah's a lovely lady,
isn't she?

19:17.114 --> 19:18.446
Yes.

19:18.481 --> 19:19.792
Such kind eyes.

19:19.828 --> 19:24.906
Plus, she's the only person
who can make a cup of tea
the way my Audrey used to.

19:24.941 --> 19:28.519
My wife passed away
a couple of years ago,
you see, so

19:30.114 --> 19:32.846
I'm on me own now.

19:32.881 --> 19:34.399
I wore this to her funeral.

19:35.841 --> 19:38.346
Have you seen Hugo?
Wandered off, has he?

19:38.381 --> 19:39.586
I'll go and have a look.

19:39.621 --> 19:40.879
Okay, thanks, Maurice.

19:42.008 --> 19:43.279
She's amazing, isn't she?

19:44.274 --> 19:45.879
She had very bad
acne as a child.

19:46.848 --> 19:47.652
As a child.

19:47.688 --> 19:50.559
She basically went through
puberty at about seven.

19:52.061 --> 19:53.319
Who's taller now?

19:54.321 --> 19:55.319
Hugo?

19:59.034 --> 20:00.199
Christ.

20:04.014 --> 20:05.439
Is it a hangman's rope?

20:06.841 --> 20:07.839
No.

20:09.214 --> 20:10.892
She's just having a nap.

20:10.928 --> 20:12.239
And that is...

20:15.648 --> 20:16.759
That's a snake, actually.

20:16.794 --> 20:18.019
It doesn't look
like a snake.

20:18.054 --> 20:22.199
It's a magic snake.
It's a secret family snake.

20:22.761 --> 20:24.039
Nice family.

20:24.074 --> 20:26.079
Yes. Good father.

20:28.621 --> 20:29.592
I just got divorced.

20:29.627 --> 20:31.519
Had a fight about which
washing machine to get,

20:31.554 --> 20:33.805
the seven kilogram load
or the nine kilogram.

20:33.841 --> 20:36.065
Then we realised
we hated each other.

20:36.101 --> 20:38.212
And that he was
sleeping with my dentist.

20:38.248 --> 20:41.592
As a medical professional,
I just find you fascinating.

20:41.627 --> 20:45.852
I mean, I almost
want to take a mould
just to mount on my wall.

20:45.888 --> 20:46.866
Goodness, stop it, George.

20:46.901 --> 20:49.612
You're making me
feel like one of those
glamour models.

20:49.648 --> 20:50.679
Excuse me.

20:55.534 --> 20:57.379
Cheer up, Barry!
So serious.

20:57.414 --> 21:01.399
You don't seem
to be showing this lady
much respect, sir.

21:02.114 --> 21:04.552
The magic snake
is very special.

21:04.587 --> 21:06.465
It means that
you're very lucky,

21:06.501 --> 21:10.319
but you must never tell
anyone you've seen it.

21:12.247 --> 21:13.866
Or

21:13.901 --> 21:15.192
you will be cursed.

21:15.194 --> 21:17.599
Terrible things
will happen.

21:17.634 --> 21:19.319
Worse than divorce?

21:20.648 --> 21:21.052
Much worse.

21:21.088 --> 21:25.006
But if you keep it a secret,
a wish will come true.

21:25.041 --> 21:26.519
Will my daddy come back?

21:27.434 --> 21:29.992
Yes, yes, he will,
but only if you
keep it a secret.

21:30.027 --> 21:33.719
Now, off you go.
And remember, secret snake.

21:33.754 --> 21:35.559
Okay.

21:38.741 --> 21:41.345
Mr Flowers,
he love children.

21:41.381 --> 21:42.792
Hugo is the perfect
size for him.

21:42.827 --> 21:44.946
He's quite small,
isn't he?

21:44.981 --> 21:46.279
He'll make him laugh.

21:48.114 --> 21:50.112
There you are!

21:50.148 --> 21:51.712
I wanna go home.

21:51.748 --> 21:53.132
She is breathing.

21:53.168 --> 21:54.519
It just...

21:55.734 --> 21:56.886
Sounds a bit strange.

21:56.921 --> 21:59.885
This lady is beautiful,
kind, intelligent...

21:59.921 --> 22:02.179
And probably
very naughty in bed.

22:02.214 --> 22:02.992
Now, stop it!

22:03.028 --> 22:05.312
Maybe you should
think twice before
talking like that.

22:05.347 --> 22:06.665
Yes, maybe you
should think twice

22:06.701 --> 22:09.639
before eating
so many cakes,
you fat shit.

22:09.674 --> 22:10.192
Goodness, George!

22:10.228 --> 22:13.906
All this
testosterone flying around,
I might get pregnant!

22:13.941 --> 22:15.599
Fucking boring, mate!

22:17.574 --> 22:20.199
Well, just keep
your language down.

22:23.587 --> 22:25.279
Does anyone remember
the happy song?

22:25.314 --> 22:27.046
If I play it,
you can sing it!

22:27.081 --> 22:29.799
Nobody can be cross
with the happy song playing.

22:36.168 --> 22:37.479
Fucking hell!

22:40.254 --> 22:42.839
I know how to
make Daddy come back.

22:43.821 --> 22:48.199
Hugo, Daddy's not
coming back.

22:49.588 --> 22:51.839
The magic snake.

23:04.687 --> 23:07.119
I think my mother's
about to die.
