01:23.917 --> 01:25.877
[Donovan] <i>There is no corpse.</i>

01:31.758 --> 01:33.593
There's no corpse.

01:34.135 --> 01:35.470
I heard you.

01:40.809 --> 01:44.604
Remind Felix Manning
that I do not tolerate loose ends.

01:44.687 --> 01:45.897
Yes, Mr. Fisk.

01:47.023 --> 01:49.859
But the body was probably just swept
away in the current.

01:51.319 --> 01:53.404
Even if Murdock
somehow escaped from the cab,

01:53.488 --> 01:56.157
how does a blind man swim to shore?

01:58.576 --> 02:01.121
This look like a blind man to you?

02:11.881 --> 02:13.716
We investigated him thoroughly.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.051
His associates.

02:16.052 --> 02:18.888
Medical and school records all check out.

02:18.972 --> 02:22.308
All confirm that Matt Murdock
lost his sight at age nine.

02:23.268 --> 02:24.269
[Fisk softly] Yes.

02:25.562 --> 02:26.855
Nevertheless...

02:28.773 --> 02:31.276
a man capable of that could have survived.

02:39.826 --> 02:42.829
And he threatened
to come between Vanessa and I.

02:57.510 --> 03:00.346
[Donovan] <i>It's time for the government</i>
<i>to honor our deal.</i>

03:01.181 --> 03:02.557
Thanks to my client,

03:02.640 --> 03:05.768
the Albanian Syndicate
has been completely wiped out.

03:06.311 --> 03:10.815
Their counterfeiting ring,
their Dark Web child pornography.

03:11.482 --> 03:14.944
And the Jalisco connection
Mr. Fisk divulged last week

03:15.028 --> 03:19.073
gave the DEA an early
and very white Christmas.

03:19.157 --> 03:22.118
And in exchange
for his ongoing cooperation,

03:22.202 --> 03:25.788
the DOJ will not be filing charges
against Vanessa Marianna.

03:26.331 --> 03:30.335
Mr. Fisk is also entitled to the return
of certain personal belongings,

03:30.418 --> 03:32.170
supervised movement within the hotel.

03:32.253 --> 03:35.298
He'll get everything he was offered.
In time.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.842
[Donovan] That time is now,
Special Agent Nadeem.

03:39.177 --> 03:41.554
Unless you'd like my client
to stop talking.

03:42.764 --> 03:46.976
FBI has sacrificed a great deal for me.

03:50.939 --> 03:56.402
And I will continue to cooperate
and trust you'll honor your word.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.912
There's a criminal I've employed.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.749
A facilitator.

04:10.792 --> 04:13.920
On my behalf,
he's laundered and hid money,

04:14.003 --> 04:17.674
bribed law enforcement
and court officials,

04:17.757 --> 04:22.929
orchestrated perjured testimony,
manufactured evidence.

04:24.472 --> 04:25.556
[Ray] Who is he?

04:28.768 --> 04:31.813
A lawyer. Matthew Murdock.

04:36.567 --> 04:37.986
[theme music playing]

06:39.107 --> 06:40.483
Alpha Team on approach.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.152
[door opens]

06:43.236 --> 06:45.947
FBI. Get back in your apartment
and close the door.

06:51.577 --> 06:52.578
Stack up.

06:53.287 --> 06:54.247
Breach.

06:57.750 --> 06:58.835
[agent shouting] FBI!

07:01.045 --> 07:02.171
[Agent Fremont] Clear!

07:15.977 --> 07:17.270
Murdock's been home.

07:18.604 --> 07:19.647
Recently.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.901
[woman] It was so nice to see you again.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.237
Take care.

07:41.627 --> 07:42.962
[Karen] Felix Manning?

07:43.045 --> 07:44.881
You haven't returned my calls.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.340
Karen Page, from the <i>Bulletin. </i>

07:47.300 --> 07:48.217
Before I go to print,

07:48.301 --> 07:50.094
I'm obligated to offer you
a chance to comment

07:50.178 --> 07:53.222
on your involvement
in laundering money for Wilson Fisk.

07:58.311 --> 08:02.857
Look, if you talk to me off the record,
help me connect some dots,

08:02.940 --> 08:04.775
I promise I will keep your name out of it.

08:07.028 --> 08:09.655
But that is only if you talk to me.

08:11.532 --> 08:14.368
You're a fixer, Mr. Manning.

08:15.703 --> 08:19.165
You're a freelancer.
Other clients, a lot to lose.

08:19.248 --> 08:22.960
Once this story breaks,
Fisk is gonna hang you out to dry.

08:24.003 --> 08:27.006
If I were you,
I would start looking out for myself.

08:28.424 --> 08:29.759
Karen Page.

08:29.842 --> 08:31.844
Daughter of Paxton and Penelope.

08:33.054 --> 08:37.141
239 Kings Road, Fagan Corners, Vermont.

08:38.476 --> 08:42.980
You had the back room. My guess,
Dad wanted his little girl to be safe.

08:44.315 --> 08:47.193
Sadly, he should've been more worried
about his little boy.

08:48.653 --> 08:51.739
Drug addicts really do destroy families,
don't they?

08:53.533 --> 08:54.784
Off the record,

08:55.493 --> 08:56.953
you're incorrect.

08:57.995 --> 08:59.747
About what I do for a living.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.250
I don't fix problems.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.460
[scribbling]

09:05.586 --> 09:08.172
I make them disappear.

09:34.657 --> 09:35.533
[tires screech]

09:36.576 --> 09:38.452
[Karen breathes heavily]

09:40.204 --> 09:41.581
Karen Page?

09:42.290 --> 09:44.208
-Who are you?
-Don't move.

09:46.711 --> 09:47.712
FBI.

09:48.504 --> 09:52.842
Uh... I have a weapon in my purse.
And a concealed carry permit.

09:52.925 --> 09:56.679
Keep your hands exactly where they are
and follow my instructions.

09:57.471 --> 09:58.931
Now turn around.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.392
[Karen whispering] Okay. Okay.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.605
[breathes heavily]

10:05.688 --> 10:07.690
[Karen] Okay. Okay.

10:08.190 --> 10:10.651
[Karen breathes heavily]

10:13.446 --> 10:14.989
What do you want from me?

10:23.164 --> 10:24.248
What happened?

10:25.291 --> 10:26.876
Why'd you bring me here?

10:28.502 --> 10:29.879
I asked him to.

10:30.546 --> 10:31.547
Is Matt okay?

10:33.007 --> 10:34.634
You wanna tell me what's going on?

10:35.217 --> 10:37.928
Ms. Page, I get that you
ask questions for a living,

10:38.012 --> 10:40.640
but, for now, I'll be the one asking.

10:56.572 --> 10:57.948
[indistinct chatter]

11:04.538 --> 11:06.624
[Ray] When's the last time
you heard from Matt Murdock?

11:07.208 --> 11:08.167
Um...

11:09.126 --> 11:09.960
Months.

11:10.044 --> 11:12.588
You haven't seen
or spoken to him in months?

11:13.089 --> 11:14.298
Uh, no.

11:16.842 --> 11:19.220
He give you any indication
when he'd be back?

11:21.263 --> 11:23.015
[clears throat] Uh, no.

11:23.557 --> 11:25.476
[Ray] Or whether he'd be back at all?

11:26.143 --> 11:28.020
[sighs] No. Then why have you been paying his bills?

11:37.446 --> 11:40.032
He's a friend. Someone had to do it
while he was away.

11:40.741 --> 11:45.621
So your friend, a blind man
who you haven't spoken to in months,

11:45.705 --> 11:49.917
just ups and disappears, and you
don't file a missing persons report?

11:50.000 --> 11:52.169
I figured he'd come back
when he was ready.

11:59.260 --> 12:02.263
Can you think of any reason
why Matt Murdock would go on the run?

12:04.223 --> 12:05.224
No.

12:07.268 --> 12:10.271
You were a secretary
for Nelson and Murdock.

12:10.354 --> 12:12.148
Mmm-mmm. Office manager.

12:13.107 --> 12:15.860
And when did the firm
first start working for Wilson Fisk?

12:15.943 --> 12:17.153
Um...

12:17.236 --> 12:19.280
We never worked for Wilson Fisk.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.580
Is that your signature?

12:27.663 --> 12:32.042
Do you remember depositing this
retainer check for a company called CGI?

12:32.126 --> 12:37.131
Yes, I do. Um... Look, Matt and Foggy
took on one case for them. That's all.

12:37.214 --> 12:39.633
According to my source,
CGI was a front for Fisk.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.635
Well, we didn't know that at the time.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.221
But you do now.

12:45.890 --> 12:49.393
So you see how your last answer
wasn't technically accurate?

12:49.477 --> 12:52.146
Okay, we never knowingly worked for Fisk.

12:52.229 --> 12:54.315
They hired us through someone else.

12:54.398 --> 12:55.232
Who?

12:56.233 --> 12:57.276
Some executive.

12:58.694 --> 12:59.695
Hang on.

13:16.670 --> 13:18.339
Was it this guy?

13:18.422 --> 13:20.883
James Wesley. You remember him?

13:22.802 --> 13:25.387
Uh, yeah. I think that was him. Why?

13:29.517 --> 13:31.977
Just trying to put the pieces together.

13:35.439 --> 13:39.026
Okay. Uh... Well, here are some
other pieces for you to put together.

13:39.777 --> 13:40.694
Um...

13:41.111 --> 13:45.574
Felix Manning. Red Lion National Bank.
Vancorp. Any of that ring any bells?

13:46.492 --> 13:47.576
I don't follow.

13:48.202 --> 13:50.704
[Karen] Well, instead of letting Fisk
use you and the FBI

13:50.788 --> 13:53.082
to retaliate against innocent lawyers
who put him in prison,

13:53.165 --> 13:56.168
why don't you ask him if he hired
a fixer named Felix Manning

13:56.252 --> 13:58.379
to launder money through Red Lion?

13:58.462 --> 14:02.383
Ask him if he's the true owner
of a shell company called Vancorp.

14:03.300 --> 14:04.301
Why would I do that?

14:04.385 --> 14:06.720
Because it just bought
the Presidential Hotel.

14:09.056 --> 14:10.724
Where are you getting this from?

14:11.559 --> 14:15.688
I ask questions for a living.
I just ask better ones than you do.

14:16.647 --> 14:21.360
Like, has your so-called prisoner just
bought the prison you're keeping him in?

14:22.069 --> 14:23.320
[chuckles]

14:23.404 --> 14:24.738
Has he bought?

14:25.364 --> 14:29.034
-So this is what? Just a theory?
-[Karen scoffs]

14:29.118 --> 14:30.286
You have any proof?

14:30.369 --> 14:33.289
Fisk is using you, Agent Nadeem.
That's what he does.

14:33.873 --> 14:34.999
Is that a no?

14:35.958 --> 14:37.334
Am I under arrest?

14:39.295 --> 14:40.296
Not at this time.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.756
Then I'm done
answering the wrong questions.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.136
[breathing shakily]

15:04.486 --> 15:05.779
Is this everything?

15:05.863 --> 15:09.491
Everything Felix's investigators
were able to dig up on short notice.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.334
Uh...

15:26.383 --> 15:28.052
This will take some time.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.471
I brought an audiobook.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.327
[Fisk sighs]

16:03.879 --> 16:05.881
[rhythmic tapping]

16:23.357 --> 16:24.692
[man] Dex, ready to go?

16:24.775 --> 16:28.028
Game starts in 20. Traffic's a nightmare.
We gotta hustle.

16:29.196 --> 16:32.616
What's the deal?
You don't even got your uniform on.

16:35.577 --> 16:36.912
You all right, buddy?

16:40.624 --> 16:42.084
Trouble in paradise?

16:44.128 --> 16:47.881
Does the headmaster know you're drilling
a hole in his pile of bricks?

16:47.965 --> 16:49.174
He doesn't like it.

16:51.885 --> 16:54.263
He gives you a hard time,
you send him my way.

16:54.346 --> 16:55.764
It's damn fine practice.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.688
Hey, I got you a little something.

17:03.939 --> 17:05.941
I was gonna wait until after the game...

17:10.070 --> 17:11.655
100% leather.

17:11.739 --> 17:14.742
That's steerhide in the pocket
and cowhide in the palm,

17:14.825 --> 17:16.160
so it's nice and soft.

17:16.910 --> 17:17.953
Try it on.

17:23.125 --> 17:26.503
An all-star pitcher
deserves some all-star gear.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.590
Come on, let's go break it in.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.261
Wait.

17:34.845 --> 17:37.514
Real quick, can I show you my new wind-up?

17:38.474 --> 17:39.349
[chuckles softly]

17:41.685 --> 17:42.936
All right, showboat.

17:43.479 --> 17:44.563
Let's see it.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.612
[indistinct chatter and cheering]

17:57.659 --> 18:00.621
You're in the zone, Dex.
Keep throwing those heaters.

18:09.129 --> 18:10.464
[umpire] Strike!

18:12.758 --> 18:13.801
Strike!

18:15.177 --> 18:16.553
Strike!

18:17.137 --> 18:18.597
Strike! Strike!

18:20.057 --> 18:21.266
Strike!

18:22.976 --> 18:26.897
All right, kiddo. Pack it in.
Let's give that arm of yours a rest.

18:26.980 --> 18:28.482
You're pulling me?

18:28.565 --> 18:33.362
-I'm gonna let Kanon finish it out.
-But... but no one's gotten a hit off me.

18:33.445 --> 18:36.073
I know. You're killin' it out here.
No question.

18:36.156 --> 18:38.575
But I gotta give other kids
some field time.

18:38.659 --> 18:43.247
You can't do this. It's not fair!
You gotta let me keep going.

18:43.831 --> 18:47.251
Keep it together, okay?
Take a few deep breaths.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.336
Big gulps of air.

18:50.170 --> 18:52.047
[stammers] I need...

18:52.131 --> 18:54.174
I need to keep going.

18:54.258 --> 18:58.262
[sobs] If I pitch a perfect game,
then they might...

19:00.013 --> 19:01.557
[sobbing]

19:03.976 --> 19:05.144
[clicks tongue]

19:05.894 --> 19:06.895
Dex...

19:08.230 --> 19:10.941
you could pitch a billion perfect games.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.652
It won't bring your parents back.

19:19.616 --> 19:20.617
Okay.

19:22.035 --> 19:23.120
Hit the pine.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.123
Grab a Popsicle.

19:26.874 --> 19:27.875
We'll talk later.

20:18.550 --> 20:21.178
[Mercer] <i>Well, this has been nice so far,</i>
<i>hasn't it?</i>

20:21.261 --> 20:22.471
<i>Talking like this.</i>

20:23.639 --> 20:25.682
Now that we've gotten to know
each other a little bit,

20:25.766 --> 20:28.518
I wonder if we could talk
about Coach Bradley?

20:32.022 --> 20:34.524
What happened at the field?

20:36.610 --> 20:38.278
How did it make you feel?

20:39.571 --> 20:40.572
Sad?

20:41.406 --> 20:43.200
Maybe a little scared? I wasn't sad.

20:46.703 --> 20:48.622
Why not, do you think?

20:48.705 --> 20:50.123
He was a jerk.

20:51.875 --> 20:52.834
How so?

20:53.252 --> 20:55.087
How was Coach Bradley a jerk?

20:57.506 --> 20:59.383
He never let me do what I wanted.

21:00.050 --> 21:02.344
Didn't know shit about pitching.

21:02.427 --> 21:06.431
He was your coach for a long time.
Was he always such a jerk to you?

21:06.515 --> 21:09.309
What about last year
when he named you MVP?

21:09.393 --> 21:10.936
Was he a jerk then?

21:11.019 --> 21:13.188
No. He used to be awesome.

21:20.153 --> 21:22.823
[Mercer] Dex, tell me...

21:22.906 --> 21:24.449
And be honest.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.827
We like honesty around here.

21:30.038 --> 21:32.916
When you hit Coach Bradley...

21:35.168 --> 21:36.670
was that an accident?

21:39.214 --> 21:42.426
Whatever you say stays between us.
That's the law.

21:48.265 --> 21:49.641
No.

21:49.725 --> 21:51.393
It wasn't an accident.

21:59.484 --> 22:00.819
Am I in trouble?

22:01.778 --> 22:02.779
No.

22:03.780 --> 22:04.614
No.

22:05.866 --> 22:06.992
It wasn't your fault.

22:07.075 --> 22:11.413
But I just told you, I did it on purpose.

22:11.496 --> 22:13.206
That doesn't mean it was your fault.

22:14.416 --> 22:16.585
It's confusing, isn't it?

22:17.377 --> 22:19.463
Here, let me put it like this.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.007
This is you, right?

22:22.090 --> 22:23.050
Yeah.

22:23.133 --> 22:24.760
This is fantastic.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.305
But you see how alone you are?

22:29.056 --> 22:32.351
It's just you,
surrounded by all this emptiness.

22:34.186 --> 22:37.564
It's been that way
for most of your life, hasn't it?

22:39.149 --> 22:40.275
Yeah.

22:40.359 --> 22:43.653
I mean, most kids, they have moms or dads

22:43.737 --> 22:47.532
to teach them right from wrong,
to show them how to behave.

22:49.534 --> 22:52.913
My parents mostly got mad at me.

22:52.996 --> 22:53.955
Yes.

22:54.039 --> 22:55.749
Then they died.

22:56.291 --> 22:58.919
And there were things
that you never learned.

22:59.711 --> 23:00.754
You see?

23:01.296 --> 23:02.506
Not your fault.

23:03.340 --> 23:06.468
Good news is, you've got me now.

23:07.636 --> 23:13.183
Now, we've got a lot of work to do,
but I think that it is going to be fun.

23:14.434 --> 23:17.521
We are going to establish some routines,

23:18.647 --> 23:20.148
learn to stay calm.

23:21.316 --> 23:24.403
And first things first,
we're gonna practice empathy.

23:24.486 --> 23:25.487
What's that?

23:25.570 --> 23:28.824
That means being kind to someone
when they're in pain.

23:28.907 --> 23:33.495
So let's say, for example, that my cat
got sick this morning and I was upset.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.372
What would you say to me?

23:37.791 --> 23:42.337
How about something like,
"I'm sorry. That sounds hard."

23:43.463 --> 23:46.508
I'm sorry. That sounds really hard.

23:46.591 --> 23:48.218
Look at you!

23:48.301 --> 23:50.137
You even put a "really" in there.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.347
I like a fast learner.

23:55.559 --> 23:59.688
I think we are gonna make a terrific team,
you and me.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.399
-[bottle pops open]
-[Mercer] Oh. [laughs]

24:04.359 --> 24:07.612
Nothing marks an occasion
like a little bubbly, huh?

24:08.780 --> 24:12.451
It's a... a Cava, actually.

24:12.534 --> 24:14.077
Spanish champagne.

24:14.911 --> 24:19.249
It was a little farewell gift
from the chiropractor down the hall.

24:19.958 --> 24:22.752
Tomorrow is my last day in the building.

24:24.588 --> 24:25.630
Here. Go on.

24:26.256 --> 24:27.966
I'm not 21.

24:28.550 --> 24:29.801
Good for you.

24:32.721 --> 24:33.722
[Mercer coughing] [sniffs]

24:39.102 --> 24:42.105
It's been quite a challenging day.

24:43.523 --> 24:45.484
Quite a few goodbyes.

24:46.943 --> 24:48.236
Lots of...

24:49.279 --> 24:51.114
longtime clients.

24:51.198 --> 24:52.782
That... That's hard.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.202
That's really hard.

25:00.373 --> 25:01.958
And then there's this,

25:02.959 --> 25:05.212
our last session together,

25:05.295 --> 25:08.298
which I've been dreading
since my prognosis.

25:08.882 --> 25:10.133
Then don't leave.

25:11.551 --> 25:13.595
We can keep meeting.
I can keep getting better.

25:13.678 --> 25:15.096
Dex...

25:16.014 --> 25:17.474
[crying] You can't leave.

25:17.557 --> 25:19.893
[Mercer] You are gonna be fine, Dex.

25:20.602 --> 25:22.354
We prepared for this.

25:23.271 --> 25:26.566
You are gonna get a job
with a nice, rigid structure.

25:26.650 --> 25:28.735
You're gonna stick to your meds.

25:29.945 --> 25:34.533
And if you get off track, you can...
listen to these.

25:36.993 --> 25:39.955
This is every session we've had.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.541
Cycle through them again.

25:43.333 --> 25:46.753
When we remind ourselves
of how far we've come,

25:46.836 --> 25:48.880
we're less inclined to slip back.

25:50.257 --> 25:51.841
And one last thing.

25:53.176 --> 25:56.888
This is a, uh... a colleague of mine.

25:56.972 --> 26:02.060
He's a fine therapist, with a lot
of expertise in your particular--

26:02.143 --> 26:04.396
I don't want another therapist!

26:06.773 --> 26:08.483
Are you trying to scare me?

26:09.025 --> 26:10.110
No.

26:11.236 --> 26:12.529
Not scare you.

26:12.612 --> 26:14.531
Then what is your intention?

26:16.074 --> 26:17.409
And be honest.

26:18.243 --> 26:19.619
I want...

26:24.541 --> 26:26.459
I want to kill you.

26:26.543 --> 26:27.669
[Mercer] Say more.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.380
Why do you want to kill me?

26:31.047 --> 26:32.841
To put me out of my misery?

26:35.218 --> 26:36.928
To punish you.

26:37.012 --> 26:39.389
I'm not quite sure what I've done wrong.

26:39.472 --> 26:42.809
I want to kill you for dying.

26:44.686 --> 26:46.229
For leaving me.

26:48.857 --> 26:51.693
Death always wins, Dex.

26:53.278 --> 26:54.613
Eventually.

26:56.531 --> 27:01.536
But when it comes quietly and naturally,
it can be a beautiful event.

27:02.621 --> 27:06.499
Which is why
we never hasten it with violence.

27:09.961 --> 27:10.962
[breathes shakily]

27:12.672 --> 27:14.466
I can't do this alone.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.177
[coughs, inhales]

27:18.428 --> 27:20.388
You remember what I did?

27:21.931 --> 27:23.850
Last time I was alone?

27:23.933 --> 27:25.393
Then find someone.

27:25.477 --> 27:27.187
I don't want another therapist!

27:27.270 --> 27:30.106
Any good person
with a decent heart will do.

27:30.690 --> 27:32.442
Someone to look up to.

27:35.779 --> 27:38.281
Your internal compass isn't broken, Dex.

27:38.365 --> 27:43.578
It just works better when you have
the North Star to guide you.

27:49.876 --> 27:50.877
[telephone ringing]

28:01.805 --> 28:03.723
Suicide Prevention, this is Dex.

28:03.807 --> 28:05.141
Who am I speaking with?

28:06.518 --> 28:09.020
Hi, Craig. How can I help you today?

28:12.357 --> 28:14.943
I'm sorry. That's hard.
That's really hard.

28:15.568 --> 28:18.780
Why don't you tell me a little bit more
about how you're feeling?

28:18.863 --> 28:22.117
That's a lot to deal with.
I'm glad you called.

28:23.243 --> 28:24.828
[whispering] You're doing amazing.

28:29.374 --> 28:30.500
[Dex] Tell me, Craig,

28:31.167 --> 28:33.837
are you thinking
about taking your own life right now?

28:34.462 --> 28:35.505
Okay.

28:39.175 --> 28:40.510
Do you have a plan?

28:50.478 --> 28:52.522
What kind of gun do you have, Craig?

28:56.109 --> 28:57.944
I'm familiar with the M11.

28:58.611 --> 29:02.031
Did a couple years in the army.
Got real cozy with the M11.

29:02.907 --> 29:04.242
It's reliable.

29:08.621 --> 29:10.790
Let me ask you a question, Craig.

29:11.708 --> 29:15.336
If this asshole stepdad of yours
is giving you so much grief,

29:16.129 --> 29:17.756
why take your own life?

29:18.423 --> 29:19.507
Why not...

29:20.300 --> 29:21.134
[inhales sharply]

29:21.217 --> 29:23.470
Take a deep breath, Craig.

29:24.554 --> 29:26.681
We're gonna work through this together.

29:27.974 --> 29:29.559
I'm not going anywhere.

30:36.376 --> 30:38.419
If I may ask, Mr. Fisk,

30:38.503 --> 30:42.549
without getting into specifics,
what's this all about?

30:48.596 --> 30:51.391
Right now, I am New York's scapegoat.

30:53.226 --> 30:56.062
Downstairs, there are protesters
chanting prayers

30:56.145 --> 30:58.940
to drive me out into the wilderness.

31:00.024 --> 31:04.195
The attention that it brings
is an impediment for my plan.

31:05.405 --> 31:08.950
Fortunately,
the public is easily distracted. Which makes the solution
for my problem quite simple.

31:17.584 --> 31:19.669
The city needs a new villain.

31:25.049 --> 31:27.427
And I think I might've found him.

31:31.848 --> 31:33.850
[Julie] Can I start you off
with something to drink?

31:39.063 --> 31:41.149
Looks like you need a little more time.

31:42.650 --> 31:44.569
I'll grab you a water.

31:46.112 --> 31:47.780
This is gonna sound random,

31:47.864 --> 31:50.742
but did you used to work
at the Brooklyn Suicide Hotline?

31:52.619 --> 31:57.165
Yeah. Yeah, I did.
That... was a tough job. [chuckles]

31:58.166 --> 31:59.459
It was. [chuckles]

32:00.627 --> 32:04.130
You probably don't remember me. I'm Julie.

32:07.884 --> 32:08.885
Dex.

32:09.969 --> 32:11.930
Yeah, of course I remember you.

32:12.889 --> 32:14.307
Small world, huh?

32:15.266 --> 32:17.977
I haven't seen you in here before.

32:18.061 --> 32:21.481
It's... it's my first day, actually.

32:21.564 --> 32:23.608
I got offered double the pay
to leave my last job

32:23.691 --> 32:27.195
if I could start here immediately.
Not that I'm complaining.

32:28.863 --> 32:31.199
What about you?
Are you staying at the hotel?

32:31.866 --> 32:34.285
[stammers] No. I live here.

32:34.369 --> 32:36.704
In New York, not in the hotel.

32:36.788 --> 32:37.830
[both laughing]

32:37.914 --> 32:39.916
The FBI has an office upstairs.

32:41.417 --> 32:43.294
We're guarding Wilson Fisk.

32:44.420 --> 32:45.713
A G-man.

32:45.797 --> 32:48.675
-[Dex chuckles softly]
-[woman] Excuse me, miss! Hello?

32:51.844 --> 32:55.974
I need to go help that table
so they don't fire me on my first day.

32:56.849 --> 32:58.518
What time do you get off?

33:00.186 --> 33:01.604
In about an hour.

33:03.022 --> 33:04.857
Do you wanna hang out after?

33:04.941 --> 33:06.109
Catch up?

33:07.777 --> 33:08.611
Uh...

33:09.404 --> 33:10.655
Yeah. [chuckles]

33:11.572 --> 33:13.116
That... That'd be great.

33:14.617 --> 33:15.451
Hmm.

33:23.126 --> 33:28.214
I got your coppa, your prosciutto,
your mocetta, your sweet soppressata.

33:28.297 --> 33:30.174
All you can eat. Free!

33:30.258 --> 33:33.052
For anybody who promises
to vote for Foggy Nelson,

33:33.136 --> 33:35.179
my less handsome brother.

33:36.180 --> 33:37.807
You can't do that, Theo.

33:37.890 --> 33:41.352
It violates election law.
It's an illegal inducement to vote.

33:41.436 --> 33:44.272
I don't see Mrs. Wobschall
calling the cops.

33:44.355 --> 33:45.189
[laughs]

33:45.273 --> 33:46.733
May I borrow a pen?

33:55.324 --> 33:57.201
Is that an actual ballot, Mrs. Callahan?

33:57.952 --> 33:59.370
I just voted for you.

33:59.454 --> 34:00.455
Absentee.

34:01.122 --> 34:05.251
When Wilson Fisk set off
those explosives in Hell's Kitchen,

34:05.334 --> 34:06.502
I lost my husband.

34:06.586 --> 34:08.880
Everything that matters, gone.

34:08.963 --> 34:10.465
Except my vote.

34:11.632 --> 34:15.136
I'm counting on you, Foggy.
You get that son of a bitch.

34:16.137 --> 34:18.473
I will. I promise.

34:22.685 --> 34:24.103
Thank you, everyone.

34:24.187 --> 34:26.981
And I'll be here till close
to answer any questions.

34:27.607 --> 34:29.358
Yeah, I got a few.

34:29.442 --> 34:33.112
Like, what's the secret ingredient
in your world-famous Nelson's sub?

34:33.863 --> 34:36.240
A soft robiola.

34:36.324 --> 34:37.784
[inhales and exhales]

34:37.867 --> 34:40.828
Perfect. Uh, team at work
is gonna love that.

34:40.912 --> 34:41.829
Uh...

34:41.913 --> 34:42.914
Give me six.

34:43.498 --> 34:47.001
Uh, Theo can help you at the counter.
Is there anything else?

34:47.085 --> 34:48.086
Yeah.

34:49.087 --> 34:50.922
When's the last time you saw Matt Murdock?

34:53.091 --> 34:54.092
Who are you?

34:59.806 --> 35:02.975
[Foggy] Crashing my campaign event,
trying to intimidate me,

35:03.059 --> 35:05.311
dropping the names of my friends...

35:05.978 --> 35:10.191
I'm not backing off my criticism
of the feds' love affair with Fisk!

35:12.860 --> 35:15.196
You seem like a decent guy, Mr. Nelson.

35:16.155 --> 35:19.283
You care about people.
About doing the right thing.

35:20.868 --> 35:22.745
I'm guessing that's why
you ditched Matt Murdock

35:22.829 --> 35:25.164
as your law partner in the first place.

35:25.248 --> 35:26.457
Am I correct?

35:27.667 --> 35:30.670
You really think I'm gonna answer
a question that leading?

35:31.295 --> 35:34.048
To be clear:
did you dissolve your partnership

35:34.132 --> 35:36.759
because Mr. Murdock
took on Wilson Fisk as a client?

35:36.843 --> 35:39.011
If you're referring to a single case

35:39.095 --> 35:42.598
where we represented a client
who allegedly worked for Fisk

35:42.682 --> 35:45.434
even though we didn't know
that at the time...

35:45.518 --> 35:46.602
the answer's no.

35:47.728 --> 35:49.438
It had nothing to do with it.

35:49.522 --> 35:52.275
Nelson and Murdock
represented a lot of clients,

35:52.358 --> 35:55.862
for whom all work
was completely ethical and legal

35:55.945 --> 35:58.281
and protected
by attorney-client privilege.

35:59.824 --> 36:01.909
When's the last time you saw Matt Murdock?

36:05.621 --> 36:06.956
Two nights ago.

36:07.790 --> 36:08.791
Where?

36:08.875 --> 36:10.877
A bar in Hell's Kitchen.

36:10.960 --> 36:12.545
And what did you discuss?

36:14.589 --> 36:16.632
That we hadn't seen each other in a while.

36:16.716 --> 36:19.093
-Did he tell you where he was going?
-No.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.720
-Where you could find him?
-No.

36:21.512 --> 36:22.680
Did he tell you anything?

36:23.598 --> 36:25.016
That he was sorry.

36:26.142 --> 36:27.226
About what?

36:27.852 --> 36:30.229
That our friendship
isn't what it used to be.

36:32.064 --> 36:34.984
So you didn't knowingly
give him your bar ID?

36:35.610 --> 36:36.611
What?

36:38.654 --> 36:39.488
[sighs]

36:40.531 --> 36:41.824
Of course not. Why would I?

36:44.702 --> 36:47.997
So he could enter a prison,
falsely using your identity,

36:48.080 --> 36:50.041
and make contact with an Albanian gang

36:50.124 --> 36:52.627
linked to the murder
of nine federal agents.

36:54.921 --> 36:56.214
I...

36:56.839 --> 36:59.675
I didn't give him my ID.

37:00.635 --> 37:03.638
Nor was I aware of anything
that he was planning.

37:05.473 --> 37:07.099
But with all due respect,

37:07.683 --> 37:10.603
-I think you have Matt Murdock all wrong.
-[scoffs]

37:10.686 --> 37:12.063
Yeah, well, uh...

37:13.356 --> 37:14.732
I don't think I do.

37:15.942 --> 37:18.694
I think Matt Murdock
is hiding a double life.

37:19.278 --> 37:22.198
Lawyer by day and criminal by night.

37:23.407 --> 37:26.244
And you and Ms. Page
both know all about it.

37:27.620 --> 37:29.455
It makes you uncomfortable.

37:29.538 --> 37:30.706
And complicit.

37:31.332 --> 37:34.585
And that's why you're no longer
law partners or friends.

37:34.669 --> 37:36.629
Because once he's finally caught,

37:36.712 --> 37:40.174
you know you're on the hook
as an accessory to his crimes.

37:40.258 --> 37:43.844
Or, if you're lucky,
simply aiding and abetting.

37:45.554 --> 37:48.891
Remind me, Special Agent Nadeem,

37:50.017 --> 37:51.727
what's Matt being charged with?

37:52.645 --> 37:53.980
Nothing so far.

37:54.063 --> 37:55.106
Great.

37:56.023 --> 37:59.986
Then the only thing
I'm aiding and abetting is your exit.

38:16.210 --> 38:17.712
Don't forget to vote.

38:20.256 --> 38:21.674
[Julie] <i>Every day?</i>

38:21.757 --> 38:22.800
[chuckles]

38:22.883 --> 38:24.719
FDR Drive's my favorite route, too.

38:24.802 --> 38:27.305
There's nothing in the world
like a winter run on the East River.

38:27.888 --> 38:31.517
Between your workout habits
and new gig, it's...

38:31.600 --> 38:33.644
it's almost like you're stalking me.

38:33.728 --> 38:34.812
[laughs]

38:34.895 --> 38:36.856
Damn. The secret's out.

38:39.400 --> 38:40.443
So...

38:41.068 --> 38:43.195
why aren't you in social work anymore?

38:43.904 --> 38:44.739
Uh...

38:44.822 --> 38:46.907
Tried to pursue my dream as a dancer.

38:47.700 --> 38:51.662
It actually was going pretty well
until I tore my ACL, again.

38:52.246 --> 38:55.499
I'm sorry. That must've been really hard.

38:55.583 --> 38:58.085
But you were brave to go for it
in the first place.

38:59.045 --> 39:00.046
I, um...

39:00.713 --> 39:02.506
I didn't have a backup plan.

39:03.090 --> 39:06.260
My parents made the mistake of telling me
I could be anything I wanted.

39:06.344 --> 39:09.055
Must've been nice to hear,
even if it didn't work out.

39:11.432 --> 39:15.227
My parents
were never really that involved.

39:17.063 --> 39:19.523
Sounds like you didn't need
the message anyhow.

39:20.816 --> 39:22.651
You did great all on your own.

39:26.238 --> 39:27.073
[chuckles]

39:28.157 --> 39:32.370
So, what's it like
working for Wilson Fisk?

39:33.162 --> 39:37.583
I don't work for him.
I work for the federal government.

39:39.794 --> 39:44.048
Must be scary to be up close and personal
with someone so dangerous.

39:44.131 --> 39:45.508
It is what it is.

39:47.635 --> 39:50.262
Do you think a killer like that
deserves a second chance?

39:51.555 --> 39:53.974
You worked at the hotline for three years.

39:54.058 --> 39:57.436
I think you of all people would believe
everyone deserves a second chance.

39:57.520 --> 39:59.480
How did you know
I worked there for three years?

40:00.064 --> 40:01.524
You were only there for one.

40:02.942 --> 40:04.652
You mentioned it earlier.

40:05.945 --> 40:07.905
You quit to do ballet.

40:07.988 --> 40:10.282
Did I also mention ballet earlier?

40:11.075 --> 40:12.410
Specifically?

40:13.285 --> 40:15.913
I guess I... I just assumed.

40:17.373 --> 40:18.374
[chuckles softly] Anyway, um...

40:21.252 --> 40:23.879
It's late. I should get home.

40:23.963 --> 40:25.381
You're ditching me?

40:25.464 --> 40:27.341
No, not at all. I...

40:28.092 --> 40:29.718
I just have to go feed my dog.

40:29.802 --> 40:31.345
You don't have a dog.

40:32.847 --> 40:34.223
How do you know that?

40:37.309 --> 40:39.103
Julie, you're misreading this.

40:39.186 --> 40:40.187
Let me pay for dinner.

40:40.271 --> 40:42.481
We'll go for a walk in the park.
I'll explain.

40:42.565 --> 40:43.691
Dinner's on me.

40:43.774 --> 40:44.775
Julie.

40:45.443 --> 40:47.236
You're very special to me.

40:47.319 --> 40:48.696
Let go of me, Dex.

40:48.779 --> 40:49.613
Please.

40:49.697 --> 40:51.449
I said let go!

40:52.116 --> 40:53.367
[Dex breathing heavily]

41:02.501 --> 41:05.504
Just being at Matt's apartment,
and his bloody clothes...

41:05.588 --> 41:06.839
And I just-- It threw me.

41:07.423 --> 41:10.926
Nadeem's smart. I probably gave him
everything he needs to figure it out.

41:11.010 --> 41:13.596
Wait. You told the FBI
that Matt is Daredevil?

41:13.679 --> 41:15.055
No, no. Of course not.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.601
[sighs] They know he's hiding something.

41:18.684 --> 41:20.311
It's not what they think, but this is bad.

41:20.394 --> 41:22.062
This is really bad. Infinitely bad.

41:22.146 --> 41:23.522
-We could all go to jail.
-Foggy--

41:23.606 --> 41:25.566
I should've never let Matt
tell you his secret.

41:25.649 --> 41:27.401
This is my fault.

41:27.485 --> 41:30.404
I'm not gonna let you pay
for our shitty mistakes.

41:30.488 --> 41:32.907
If it comes to it,
I'll plead in exchange for your immunity.

41:32.990 --> 41:34.116
Foggy...

41:36.702 --> 41:38.204
You always see the good in people.

41:38.287 --> 41:42.041
But you put us on such high pedestals,
you can't see who we really are.

41:42.625 --> 41:45.920
I didn't tell the FBI Matt is Daredevil.
I did something worse.

41:46.003 --> 41:47.671
Karen, breathe.

41:48.672 --> 41:50.132
I'm in trouble.

41:50.216 --> 41:51.759
Tell me what happened.

41:53.552 --> 41:56.305
I'm gonna need attorney-client privilege
before I can.

41:57.765 --> 42:00.726
Okay, um, give me five bucks.

42:08.067 --> 42:09.360
[breathing heavily]

42:09.443 --> 42:12.029
Good enough. I'm officially your lawyer.

42:16.909 --> 42:19.328
Do you remember the... the Healy trial?

42:20.579 --> 42:24.458
And there was that...
that guy from... from CGI

42:24.542 --> 42:28.295
who offered us a stupid amount of money
to take his case?

42:28.921 --> 42:30.798
Yeah, how could I forget that creep?

42:31.590 --> 42:33.300
His name's James Wesley.

42:34.385 --> 42:35.719
He worked for Fisk.

42:37.388 --> 42:38.806
He disappeared shortly after that,

42:38.889 --> 42:40.766
and they think
Matt had something to do with it.

42:41.600 --> 42:44.436
That's crazy.
Matt had nothing to do with that.

42:44.520 --> 42:48.148
I know. But if they keep investigating,
they're gonna find out that I did.

42:48.691 --> 42:49.525
What?

42:54.071 --> 42:55.239
I killed him.

43:37.781 --> 43:38.616
[yells]

43:39.742 --> 43:40.743
[breathing heavily]

43:53.255 --> 43:55.382
Shit. Shit.

44:01.388 --> 44:02.222
[groans] [yelling]

44:30.042 --> 44:31.710
-[yells]
-[cutlery clattering]

44:43.472 --> 44:44.306
[yells]

44:54.191 --> 44:56.193
[breathing heavily]

45:06.662 --> 45:09.373
[Mercer] <i>It's good to see you, Dex.</i>
<i>How was your week?</i>

45:09.915 --> 45:11.667
[young Dex] <i>I'm scared, Dr. Mercer.</i>

45:12.292 --> 45:15.087
[Mercer] <i>Scared? What's making you scared?</i>

46:16.064 --> 46:16.899
[groans]

46:31.121 --> 46:32.706
[Ray] Alpha Team on approach.

46:37.336 --> 46:40.047
[Ray] FBI. Get back in your apartment
and close the door.

46:40.130 --> 46:41.131
[door closes] [Ray] Stack up.

46:47.596 --> 46:48.889
Breach.

46:50.432 --> 46:51.433
[FBI agent] FBI!

46:51.975 --> 46:52.810
Clear!

46:55.938 --> 46:57.231
Murdock's been home.

46:58.315 --> 46:59.358
Recently.

47:00.192 --> 47:03.237
Command post, we're clear.
Suspect's not here.

47:05.197 --> 47:08.158
[woman over police radio]
<i>NYPD has been advised. Citywide BOLO.</i>

47:08.242 --> 47:11.537
<i>Suspect Matthew Murdock</i>
<i>to be considered armed and dangerous.</i>
