- Normally, you don't
go to jail for catfishing.

03:44.470 --> 03:45.570
- Right.
- But she was, like,

03:45.640 --> 03:47.310
blackmailing.
- Right.

"Well, guess what."

- "She just got out of jail,

- Hey, Paris, how you doing?

04:13.200 --> 04:14.640
What's going on?
It's been a while.

04:14.700 --> 04:16.269
<i> - Um, everything's been</i>
<i> really good.</i>

04:16.339 --> 04:17.839
- This is a little different
for us.

04:17.910 --> 04:19.510
We don't usually do
this sort of thing because

04:19.579 --> 04:21.510
you're not actively
being catfished.

04:21.579 --> 04:23.110
You're not in a relationship
with someone on the Internet.

04:23.180 --> 04:24.110
You're the sort of
past victim...

04:24.180 --> 04:25.380
- Victim.

04:25.450 --> 04:27.350
- Of a catfishing.
<i> - Yes.</i>

04:27.420 --> 04:30.650
- And now she's out of jail,
and you're worried.

04:30.720 --> 04:32.390
<i> - Yeah, I'm worried because</i>
<i> I think she is</i>

04:32.460 --> 04:34.320
<i> going to do it again.</i>

04:34.390 --> 04:37.660
<i> I'm worried about, you know,</i>
<i> other people getting catfished</i>

04:37.730 --> 04:39.690
<i> by her because</i>
<i> she's good at it, obviously.</i>

04:39.760 --> 04:41.930
- Has she tried to reach out
to you since she got out?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.530
<i> - No.</i>

04:43.600 --> 04:45.070
- Well, maybe she has,
and you don't know.

04:45.140 --> 04:46.800
<i> - She could very well be.</i>

04:46.870 --> 04:49.540
<i> Now that she's out of jail,</i>
<i> I'm really scared.</i>

04:49.610 --> 04:51.570
<i> And I'm hoping you guys</i>
<i> will make sure she's not</i>

04:51.640 --> 04:54.410
<i> going to do it again because</i>
<i>it would protect a lot of people</i>

04:54.480 --> 04:56.240
<i> from having to go through</i>
<i> all this--</i>

04:56.310 --> 04:59.110
- What we really want to do is
we want to bury this for good.

04:59.180 --> 05:00.450
<i> - Yes.</i>

05:00.520 --> 05:02.150
- I still have
so many questions.

05:02.220 --> 05:03.820
<i> - So can you guys meet up</i>
<i> to talk about it?</i>

05:03.890 --> 05:05.590
- Where are you?
<i> - I am in LA right now.</i>

05:05.660 --> 05:07.460
- Oh, cool.
- So the good news is

05:07.520 --> 05:09.860
we're already in LA,
and we can meet you right now.

05:09.930 --> 05:11.590
<i> - Okay.</i>
- All right, we'll see you soon.

05:11.660 --> 05:13.260
<i> - I'll see you soon.</i>
- Bye, Paris.

05:13.330 --> 05:15.060
- Bye, Paris.
<i> - Bye.</i>

05:15.130 --> 05:18.000
<i>- Now that the mastermind behind</i>
<i> the craziest catfish ever</i>

05:18.070 --> 05:21.700
<i>is out of jail, Paris isn't the</i>
<i>only one who should be worried.</i>

05:21.770 --> 05:24.740
<i> Hopefully, we can put</i>
<i> all our years of experience</i>

05:24.810 --> 05:27.910
<i> catching catfish to the test</i>
<i> to track down Shelly</i>

05:27.980 --> 05:30.550
<i> and make sure</i>
<i> she never does it again.</i>

05:30.610 --> 05:33.180
First thing we need to do
is talk to Paris,

05:33.250 --> 05:35.820
get her side of the story,
see if we can also get

05:35.890 --> 05:37.620
Chris Andersen's side
of the story, and then,

05:37.690 --> 05:40.890
hopefully, track down
this Shelly woman.

05:40.960 --> 05:44.230
- I love it when you talk
like a detective.

05:44.290 --> 05:46.960
Hey, look who it is.
- Hi.

05:47.030 --> 05:49.830
- She's right there.
When was the last time we spoke?

05:49.900 --> 05:51.930
- It was a while ago.
- Can you go back to

05:52.000 --> 05:53.670
the beginning and, you know...
- Mm-hmm.

05:53.740 --> 05:55.700
- Just give us the whole
timeline of events.

05:55.770 --> 05:58.910
- Okay, so, at that time,
I was 17 years old,

05:58.980 --> 06:02.110
<i> still in high school</i>
<i> and had been a Birdman fan,</i>

06:02.180 --> 06:04.280
and I liked his Facebook
fan page.

06:04.350 --> 06:07.880
<i>And then I got a friend request</i>
<i> from Chris Andersen.</i>

06:07.950 --> 06:09.850
We would text day and night.
- But never talking

06:09.920 --> 06:11.450
on the phone.
- Never talking on the phone.

06:11.520 --> 06:12.950
- Okay.
- Then it moved to flirting,

06:13.020 --> 06:14.920
and then it moved to
the photo sharing.

06:14.990 --> 06:17.160
Sent me selfies of himself
in the mirror, and I'm sending

06:17.230 --> 06:19.760
<i> him full nude photos.</i>

06:19.830 --> 06:22.560
- So what's crazy,
looking back, is that Shelly

06:22.630 --> 06:24.400
was obviously the one...
- Mm-hmm.

06:24.470 --> 06:26.170
- Who was sending them
to each of you.

06:26.240 --> 06:28.340
- To each of us, yeah.
- So she had, like, a collection

06:28.410 --> 06:31.040
of photos of you, and she had
a collection of photos of Chris.

06:31.110 --> 06:33.070
- Yeah, so we never even were
sending it to each other.

06:33.140 --> 06:34.640
- Okay.
- And then I ended up getting

06:34.710 --> 06:37.110
a friend request
from this guy, Tom.

06:37.180 --> 06:39.880
He told me he was best friends
with Chris Andersen

06:39.950 --> 06:42.620
and his brother-in-law--that's
what he always called himself.

06:42.690 --> 06:45.720
- I'm getting the feeling
that Tom is really Shelly.

06:45.790 --> 06:49.290
- Yeah, and Tom's always
texting, "Chris wants you

06:49.360 --> 06:51.060
<i> to come fly out there."</i>

06:51.130 --> 06:54.260
So I talked to Chris a little--
I was a little iffy--

06:54.330 --> 06:55.830
and then he said,
"I got your ticket,"

06:55.900 --> 06:57.270
and he emailed me the ticket.

06:57.330 --> 06:59.030
- What'd you say
to your parents?

06:59.100 --> 07:01.940
- Well, I was going out
with this guy from Washington,

07:02.010 --> 07:04.270
so I just said
I was going there.

07:04.340 --> 07:07.010
- So he show--so you
get to Denver...

07:07.080 --> 07:09.180
- So I get to Denver.
- You text him, "I'm here"?

07:09.250 --> 07:12.080
- Mm-hmm, and he said,
"Okay, I'm coming around."

07:12.150 --> 07:14.850
- So you actually texted Shelly,
"I'm here," and then

07:14.920 --> 07:17.620
she immediately
texted Chris and said,

07:17.690 --> 07:19.750
"I'm here, pick me up,"
and then, like, he texted...

07:19.820 --> 07:21.520
- Whoa.
- It was, like, immediate.

07:21.590 --> 07:23.860
- That's crazy.
- So then we get to his house.

07:23.930 --> 07:25.830
- Okay.
- Then we started talking

07:25.900 --> 07:27.930
a little, and I said something
like, "Well, Tom said..."

07:28.000 --> 07:31.030
And he said, "Who's Tom?"
And I said, "You know, Tom."

07:31.100 --> 07:32.630
- Your best friend.
- And he was like,

07:32.700 --> 07:34.240
"No, I don't."
- That is so weird.

07:34.300 --> 07:35.870
- And then he was all--
- And in your mind,

07:35.940 --> 07:37.540
you're kind of, like,
freaking out.

07:37.610 --> 07:39.240
- I was like, okay,
he's just doing it

07:39.310 --> 07:41.040
to mess around or something.
And I remember he's all

07:41.110 --> 07:42.840
"You brought Victoria's
Secret to wear."

07:42.910 --> 07:44.780
And I said, "No, I didn't.
I didn't, but okay."

07:44.850 --> 07:47.580
- But you weren't like,
"Wait a minute"?

07:47.650 --> 07:49.350
- No, it crossed my mind
to think,

07:49.420 --> 07:51.590
"that's a little weird," but--
- At the time, you weren't

07:51.650 --> 07:53.290
piecing it together.
- He's right there,

07:53.360 --> 07:55.260
so it doesn't matter.
And then I played with his dog

07:55.330 --> 07:57.120
<i> for a while, and then we</i>
<i> sat down and we talked</i>

07:57.190 --> 07:59.190
a little more, and then,
you know, we ended up kissing--

07:59.260 --> 08:01.400
ended up kissing, I don't know.
- Okay, so you were into it.

08:01.460 --> 08:02.700
You were feeling it.
- Yeah, of course.

08:02.770 --> 08:04.270
- Great.
- But he was really sweet

08:04.330 --> 08:06.200
in the morning, and then
he left to go practice,

08:06.270 --> 08:08.070
and I stayed, and I texted
Tom the whole time.

08:08.140 --> 08:09.940
<i> And he was like,</i>
<i> "How's it going?"</i>

08:10.010 --> 08:11.840
<i> "Oh, you should go look</i>
<i> in his closet</i>

08:11.910 --> 08:13.670
<i> and take a picture</i>
<i> with his hat on."</i>

08:13.740 --> 08:15.180
<i> And I was like, no,</i>
<i> I wasn't gonna go</i>

08:15.250 --> 08:16.940
<i> looking through</i>
<i> somebody's stuff, so.</i>

08:17.010 --> 08:20.080
- Yeah, weird.
- So after that, with Chris,

08:20.150 --> 08:21.720
it was, like, really good,
you know?

08:21.780 --> 08:23.320
- You guys really
liked each other.

08:23.390 --> 08:25.020
- Yeah, and then drove me back
to the airport.

08:25.090 --> 08:26.820
- Was there talk about, like,
"Okay, well,

08:26.890 --> 08:28.460
can I see you again?"
- Yeah, there was like

08:28.530 --> 08:29.860
a next time, yeah.
So it was all nice.

08:29.930 --> 08:31.530
It ended nicely,
and then I went home.

08:31.590 --> 08:34.000
And then Chris and Tom
were obsessed

08:34.059 --> 08:36.559
with "Call of Duty," right?
And this Xbox.

08:36.630 --> 08:41.240
<i> There's this talk of this guy</i>
<i> that Tom can't effing stand.</i>

08:41.299 --> 08:43.440
Forget the name of the guy,
but he lived in Indiana.

08:43.510 --> 08:44.970
The guy was beating him
at his game.

08:45.040 --> 08:46.810
- Beating him on
"Call of Duty"?

08:46.880 --> 08:48.780
- On "Call of Duty,"
and he couldn't stand it,

08:48.850 --> 08:52.080
so they wanted to set me up
to fly to Indiana to go steal

08:52.150 --> 08:55.550
his game account and password.
So they can hack in

08:55.620 --> 08:57.050
and break it all.
- So this is the weirdest part

08:57.120 --> 08:58.920
of the whole story.
What?

08:58.990 --> 09:01.390
- Okay, so Shelly, as Chris
and Tom, said to you--

09:01.460 --> 09:04.460
- They were both going at me.
I got pressure and pressure,

09:04.530 --> 09:06.830
<i>and they were going crazier and</i>
<i>crazier, and Chris was offering</i>

09:06.900 --> 09:09.630
me purses, and, you know,
I went back on forth on it

09:09.700 --> 09:11.300
because I was getting
so pressured.

09:11.370 --> 09:13.130
I couldn't stand it.
And then I said, "You know what?

09:13.200 --> 09:16.200
I'm not doing it."
It set them off.

09:16.270 --> 09:18.410
Then Chris and then Tom were
saying, "I'm gonna send somebody

09:18.470 --> 09:21.340
<i> "down there to rape you</i>
<i> and kill you and throw you</i>

09:21.410 --> 09:23.040
on the side of the street."

09:23.110 --> 09:25.310
And that's when I just turned
off my phone.

09:25.380 --> 09:28.780
<i> Like, an hour later,</i>
<i> when I turned that phone on,</i>

09:28.850 --> 09:30.850
as Chris Andersen, she said,
"I'm gonna post

09:30.920 --> 09:34.860
your nude pictures."
That's when it got really heavy.

09:38.900 --> 09:40.490
<i> - Talking to Paris,</i>
<i> we learned the depths</i>

09:40.560 --> 09:43.030
<i> this devious catfish, Shelly,</i>
<i> had gone to.</i>

09:43.100 --> 09:46.200
<i> Not only did she manipulate</i>
<i> Paris into a relationship,</i>

09:46.270 --> 09:48.800
<i> but Shelly also</i>
<i> threatened her life.</i>

09:48.870 --> 09:50.570
<i> - Then I just turned off</i>
<i> my phone.</i>

09:50.640 --> 09:53.110
<i> Like an hour later,</i>
<i> when I turned that phone on,</i>

09:53.180 --> 09:55.410
that's when, as Chris Andersen,
she said, "I'm gonna post

09:55.480 --> 09:58.050
<i> "your nude pictures.</i>
<i> Go to this link,</i>

09:58.110 --> 10:00.980
<i> go to this page, go look.</i>
<i> Go look right now."</i>

10:01.050 --> 10:03.680
<i> So I click on the link, and</i>
<i>there's my pictures on a thread.</i>

10:03.750 --> 10:06.450
<i> "Look at this whore."</i>
<i> She was writing my address</i>

10:06.520 --> 10:09.120
<i> and my number</i>
<i> and my mother's number,</i>

10:09.190 --> 10:11.790
<i> because I had texted off</i>
<i> my mom's phone too.</i>

10:11.860 --> 10:14.900
- Whoa, are people calling?
- Like crazy.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.730
<i> [phones ringing]</i>

10:16.800 --> 10:20.070
- And I remember, one time,
somebody called my mom's phone,

10:20.140 --> 10:22.000
was whispering,
"You're so beautiful,"

10:22.070 --> 10:23.600
over and over and over and over.

10:23.670 --> 10:24.940
- Wow, so you must be
freaking out.

10:25.010 --> 10:26.470
- Mm-hmm.
- Did you tell your mom

10:26.540 --> 10:28.310
that this happened?
- So I had to tell my mom

10:28.380 --> 10:31.080
when all these pictures,
and about the address and stuff.

10:31.150 --> 10:33.050
- And what does
your mom say?

10:33.120 --> 10:36.180
- Um, you know, it was a mix
of disappointment and shock

10:36.250 --> 10:38.520
and trying to wrap her head
around it and everything.

10:38.590 --> 10:41.190
You know, we had to focus on
these pictures at that moment,

10:41.260 --> 10:43.220
and that's
when we called the cops.

10:43.290 --> 10:45.330
<i>- Investigators taking evidence</i>
<i> from his home this morning,</i>

10:45.400 --> 10:47.430
<i> part of an investigation</i>
<i> with the Internet Crimes</i>

10:47.500 --> 10:49.260
<i> Against Children unit.</i>

10:49.330 --> 10:52.130
- Essentially, you're accusing
Birdman of child pornography.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.340
- Yeah, so the police come,
collect my phone,

10:54.400 --> 10:57.140
camera, and computer.
- And who was your point person

10:57.210 --> 10:59.010
at the police?
- This guy,

10:59.080 --> 11:02.080
Constable Gord Olson,
which was a Canadian cop.

11:02.150 --> 11:03.740
- Oh, right, 'cause
she's from Canada.

11:03.810 --> 11:05.350
- Yeah.
- So Constable Gord explained

11:05.420 --> 11:07.210
to both you and Chris
what actually happened.

11:07.280 --> 11:08.880
- Yeah.
- And how did you feel

11:08.950 --> 11:10.580
towards Chris when
you found out that--

11:10.650 --> 11:12.290
- I felt really bad.

11:12.360 --> 11:14.720
<i>People calling him a pedophile.</i>
<i> It's just sick to me</i>

11:14.790 --> 11:18.430
<i> what she did to me and Chris.</i>
<i> She tore up our lives.</i>

11:18.490 --> 11:20.660
- And she wasn't even
in jail for very long,

11:20.730 --> 11:22.230
based on kind of
all the damage she did.

11:22.300 --> 11:24.200
- Yeah.
- Yeah, now that she's out,

11:24.270 --> 11:26.070
I would put--bet my life on it.
She's gonna do it again

11:26.140 --> 11:27.840
because she was
so unsympathetic.

11:27.900 --> 11:30.040
Like, she said Chris
should be glad that

11:30.110 --> 11:31.810
she got him somebody,
and then she said

11:31.870 --> 11:33.610
I should be thanking her.

11:33.680 --> 11:36.240
- Wow, like a sense of sort of
accomplishment and pride...

11:36.310 --> 11:37.850
- Yeah.
- Over what she had done.

11:37.910 --> 11:39.580
- She just didn't care.

11:39.650 --> 11:41.120
- Wow.
- She's sadistic

11:41.180 --> 11:42.720
and cold-blooded.
- Yeah.

11:42.790 --> 11:44.320
- That's--so what's the plan?
- Crazy.

11:44.390 --> 11:46.350
- So we need to talk to
both the police and Chris.

11:46.420 --> 11:48.190
- I think what would help
is if you gave us

11:48.260 --> 11:50.760
the contact information
of Constable Gord.

11:50.830 --> 11:52.960
- I will do that.
- All right.

11:53.030 --> 11:54.700
- Thank you.
- You too.

11:54.760 --> 11:57.400
<i> We've never tackled</i>
<i> a catfish this big before.</i>

11:57.470 --> 12:00.770
<i> And with Shelly out of jail,</i>
<i> there's no time to waste.</i>

12:00.840 --> 12:03.140
<i> [upbeat music]</i>

12:03.210 --> 12:05.210
<i> What happened to Paris</i>
<i> was awful enough,</i>

12:05.270 --> 12:07.540
<i> but Chris Andersen</i>
<i> was even more devastated</i>

12:07.610 --> 12:09.040
<i> by Shelly's actions.</i>

12:09.110 --> 12:11.110
<i> So before we confront</i>
<i> Shelly herself,</i>

12:11.180 --> 12:13.210
<i> we need to get</i>
<i> Birdman's side of the story.</i>

12:13.280 --> 12:15.320
- Okay, booking agent contact.

12:15.380 --> 12:18.020
<i> - But getting ahold of Chris</i>
<i> was proving to be tricky,</i>

12:18.090 --> 12:18.990
<i> to say the least.</i>

12:19.060 --> 12:20.350
<i> [phone beeps]</i>

12:20.420 --> 12:22.320
- Hi, I'd like to
speak with someone

12:22.390 --> 12:26.290
who could book Chris Andersen
for a speaking engagement

12:26.360 --> 12:29.800
with me.
Thank you.

12:29.870 --> 12:31.270
- Have you ever left
a message before?

12:31.330 --> 12:33.000
[laughter]

12:33.070 --> 12:35.100
<i> If we were gonna shut down</i>
<i> Shelly, we needed</i>

12:35.170 --> 12:39.040
<i> the facts of Chris' case,</i>
<i>and we knew just who to turn to.</i>

12:39.110 --> 12:42.880
- I do know the Sklar Brothers.
They would be able to kind of

12:42.950 --> 12:44.750
give us the whole rundown.

12:44.810 --> 12:48.080
<i> - The Sklar Brothers</i>
<i> are twin sports commentators</i>

12:48.150 --> 12:50.580
<i> best known for their</i>
<i> contributions to ESPN</i>

12:50.650 --> 12:51.990
<i> and their weekly podcast.</i>

12:52.050 --> 12:53.850
- Hey.
- Hey, buddy.

12:53.920 --> 12:55.790
- In the house.
- How are you?

12:55.860 --> 12:58.360
<i> - These guys know a ton about</i>
<i> basketball, which is great,</i>

12:58.430 --> 13:00.330
<i> because Max and I,</i>
<i> we're not really experts</i>

13:00.400 --> 13:02.460
<i> when it comes to</i>
<i> that kind of thing.</i>

13:02.530 --> 13:05.030
- We are here for a very
specific reason.

13:05.100 --> 13:06.170
- Okay.
- All right.

13:06.240 --> 13:07.770
- Birdman.
- Right.

13:07.840 --> 13:09.840
- When this story broke--
- It was tragic.

13:09.910 --> 13:12.870
<i> For a second, I was like,</i>
<i> "Oh, no, what is he,</i>

13:12.940 --> 13:14.980
<i> messing around with</i>
<i> 10 year olds and 9 year olds?"</i>

13:15.040 --> 13:16.680
- 'Cause they didn't
give details.

13:16.750 --> 13:18.410
He was like a white Rodman.
He's not a loved guy.

13:18.480 --> 13:20.080
- He wasn't, like,
a beloved character.

13:20.150 --> 13:21.680
- It's not Michael Jordan.
It's not LeBron.

13:21.750 --> 13:23.080
- I mean, tattoos
up to the neck--

13:23.150 --> 13:24.750
- He's got, like,
a turtleneck of tattoos.

13:24.820 --> 13:28.290
- His face is probably
a tattoo of his face, okay?

13:28.360 --> 13:29.920
- [laughs]

13:29.990 --> 13:32.330
<i> - His tattoos weren't the only</i>
<i> thing that contributed</i>

13:32.400 --> 13:34.630
<i> to Chris Andersen's</i>
<i> bad boy reputation.</i>

13:34.700 --> 13:37.400
<i> In 2006, Chris Andersen</i>
<i> was suspended from the NBA</i>

13:37.470 --> 13:41.140
<i> for two years for violating</i>
<i>the league's drug abuse policy.</i>

13:41.200 --> 13:43.140
<i> He did his best to</i>
<i> clean up his image.</i>

13:43.210 --> 13:46.140
<i> He went to rehab</i>
<i>and even dedicated tons of time</i>

13:46.210 --> 13:47.510
<i> volunteering with kids.</i>

13:47.580 --> 13:49.380
- Birdman!
[cheers and applause]

13:49.450 --> 13:51.250
<i> - He became a real hero</i>
<i> in the community</i>

13:51.310 --> 13:53.580
<i> on and off the court,</i>
<i> which is why</i>

13:53.650 --> 13:55.520
<i> when the public heard</i>
<i> he was suspected</i>

13:55.590 --> 13:59.650
<i> of crimes against children,</i>
<i> the news hit hard.</i>

13:59.720 --> 14:01.960
- After he was...
- Accused.

14:02.020 --> 14:04.230
- Accused, then the team
releases him.

14:04.290 --> 14:06.490
<i>And now he's like damaged goods.</i>
<i> - Right.</i>

14:06.560 --> 14:09.460
- Nobody wants to pick him up,
but no concrete, like, charges

14:09.530 --> 14:11.730
were brought.
He's just being investigated.

14:11.800 --> 14:15.100
- And then it's broken that,
in fact, it was some

14:15.170 --> 14:16.770
strange situation
with a woman in Canada.

14:16.840 --> 14:20.440
- But it never went away.
There wasn't like the equivalent

14:20.510 --> 14:23.180
of the news breaking.
There wasn't that equivalent

14:23.250 --> 14:24.550
of admonishing him
and saying he's--

14:24.610 --> 14:26.580
- Right.
- They're never gonna clear.

14:26.650 --> 14:29.850
- There will still be people
who will forever label this guy

14:29.920 --> 14:31.650
a pedophile.

14:31.720 --> 14:34.190
- I think what we're hoping
is that after this episode,

14:34.260 --> 14:37.420
to a certain degree, we can help
push the tipping point

14:37.490 --> 14:40.430
of his redemption back.
- I hope so because this woman

14:40.500 --> 14:43.100
cannot be let off the hook.
- All right.

14:43.170 --> 14:44.730
- All right, boys, good luck.
- Thank, guys.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.770
- Good luck, good luck.
- Good luck on the quest.

14:46.840 --> 14:49.600
<i>- Now more than ever, we wanted</i>
<i> to get in touch with Shelly,</i>

14:49.670 --> 14:52.970
<i> but we didn't know how.</i>
<i> Luckily, we had some help.</i>

14:53.040 --> 14:54.280
[phone buzzing]

14:54.340 --> 14:55.980
Look at this.
Paris texted,

14:56.050 --> 14:58.310
"Hey, I spoke with
Constable Gord Olson,

14:58.380 --> 15:00.550
"and he wants to meet with you

15:00.620 --> 15:02.520
"get up to Canada.
He can be reached

15:02.590 --> 15:05.120

Good luck."

15:05.190 --> 15:06.690
- Winnipeg.
- Canada.

<i> We're gonna be</i>
<i> a few hours from her.</i>

15:12.160 --> 15:13.830

as warmly as I know how to

15:13.900 --> 15:15.600
for our trip to Canada.

15:15.670 --> 15:17.870
<i> - ♪ When you fade right there</i>

- We're on our way to Winnipeg
because we've got a meeting

15:21.140 --> 15:23.970
with Constable Gord.
He's the cop that

15:24.040 --> 15:25.970
should know
what exactly went down.

15:26.040 --> 15:28.740
<i> - ♪ It hurts ♪</i>

15:28.810 --> 15:30.340
<i> ♪ It hurts ♪</i>

<i> snowy Winnipeg,</i>

15:32.820 --> 15:36.220
<i> where the sky and the ground</i>
<i> are the exact same color.</i>

15:36.290 --> 15:39.450
- I'm excited to meet
Constable Gord.

15:39.520 --> 15:41.620
<i> Constable Gord Olson</i>

<i> investigator out here</i>

15:45.190 --> 15:46.690
<i> on the Shelly case.</i>

15:46.760 --> 15:48.230
There he is.
All right, thank you so much.

15:48.300 --> 15:49.730
- How are you?
- Hey.

15:49.800 --> 15:51.530
<i> Gord knows more</i>
<i> about this complex case</i>

15:51.600 --> 15:53.630
<i> than anyone, and we have</i>
<i> so many questions.</i>

15:53.700 --> 15:56.900
<i> Was the Tom persona created</i>
<i> just to catfish Paris?</i>

15:56.970 --> 15:59.540
<i> Were Birdman and Paris</i>
<i> Shelly's only victims?</i>

15:59.610 --> 16:03.110
<i> We need answers, and we're</i>
<i>hoping Constable Gord has them.</i>

16:03.180 --> 16:07.450
I would love if you could just
sort of rewind the tape...

16:07.520 --> 16:11.090
- Sure.
- Back to your first sort of...

16:11.150 --> 16:13.190
- Interact--okay.
- Moment where this became

16:13.260 --> 16:14.660
a case for you.
- For sure.

16:14.720 --> 16:19.160
It started back
in May of 2012, actually.

16:19.230 --> 16:22.930
Detective Shawn Cronce
from the Douglas County

16:23.000 --> 16:26.130
sheriff's office in Colorado,
she was involved in

16:26.200 --> 16:28.500
an investigation
of the basketball player,

16:28.570 --> 16:33.470
and she was seeing some
phone numbers and IP addresses

16:33.540 --> 16:37.010
<i> that were coming back</i>

this whole story?

17:02.670 --> 17:07.640

that--that Shelly came up with.

17:07.710 --> 17:12.510
There was a woman from Texas
that she connected with as him.

17:12.579 --> 17:15.119

17:44.610 --> 17:47.250
- I've never really talked
about this with anybody else.

Shelly, as this male persona,
really put this Texas woman

17:52.020 --> 17:56.590
through an emotional ringer,
and when we showed up there

17:56.660 --> 17:59.760
and told her, "Look, you were
talking to Shelly Chartier,"

17:59.830 --> 18:02.500
she was devastated.
It was like we were telling her

18:02.570 --> 18:05.000

be in the U.S.?

24 to 48 years in jail.

for her to reoffend
using a device and being

18:31.630 --> 18:33.690

- And that's how you knew?
- We were cool.

26:17.130 --> 26:18.660
We were playing together.
- She was the one.

26:18.730 --> 26:20.160
- Yeah.
[laughs]

26:20.230 --> 26:21.530
- I was on his team,
and I kept stabbing him.

26:21.600 --> 26:24.800
- [chuckles]
- So he would talk.

26:24.870 --> 26:28.130
- I'm very happy she's home.

26:28.200 --> 26:29.800
'Cause I wasn't eating,
I wasn't.

26:29.870 --> 26:33.040
I was more worried about her
and how she was doing

26:33.110 --> 26:35.010
over there.
- You know, I guess

26:35.080 --> 26:38.410
in the United States
they're trying to get her

26:38.480 --> 26:40.280
to come down there.
- Mm-hmm.

26:40.350 --> 26:42.980
- Which is, I imagine,
pretty frightening.

26:43.050 --> 26:46.050
- Yeah, if that happened,
I'm for sure

26:46.120 --> 26:49.690
going to be six feet under.

26:49.760 --> 26:51.390
- What up?
- Hey.

26:51.460 --> 26:54.230
- Can you maybe show me
a little more of the house?

26:54.300 --> 26:55.430
A little tour?
- Sure.

26:55.500 --> 26:56.630
- Yeah.

26:56.700 --> 26:58.130
- Here's the kitchen.
- Yeah, that's--

26:58.200 --> 26:59.830
We got married right here.

26:59.900 --> 27:02.240
- Oh, yeah, we did.
This is where we got married.

27:02.300 --> 27:04.000
- This was the spot?
- Yep, she was, like,

27:04.070 --> 27:07.340
standing right here.
Look that way.

27:07.410 --> 27:09.310
- Do you want to see
what I made in jail?

27:09.380 --> 27:11.880
- Yeah.
That's beautiful.

27:11.950 --> 27:13.710
- Oh, here's a picture
of my dog.

27:13.780 --> 27:17.950
A girl in jail tried to buy this
picture off of me for chips.

27:18.020 --> 27:19.920
[laughter]

27:19.990 --> 27:21.520
- Smooth.
- He's very happy.

27:21.590 --> 27:23.090
- Yeah.

27:23.160 --> 27:26.960
- This was her for Halloween.
- Oh, my God, look at this.

27:27.030 --> 27:29.200
- She was a bumblebee.

27:29.260 --> 27:32.400
- Buzzing around.
- Mm-hmm.

27:32.470 --> 27:34.900
- So tomorrow the real
interview's gonna happen?

27:34.970 --> 27:37.140
- We were just assuming maybe
it would be tomorrow.

27:37.210 --> 27:40.210
- Okay.
- All right, bye, guys.

27:42.980 --> 27:45.150
[sighs]
Wow.

27:45.210 --> 27:48.050
I don't know whether we just
connected with her,

27:48.120 --> 27:51.020
but, like, it's hard
to remember that she did

27:51.090 --> 27:53.490
some really terrible things.
- Right.

27:53.560 --> 27:56.390
- Well, I think we did
what we intended to do.

27:56.460 --> 28:00.130
We made a connection, and now,
tomorrow, we can

28:00.200 --> 28:02.230
get to the bottom of things.

28:04.230 --> 28:06.670
- Back to Easterville.

28:06.740 --> 28:09.340
Yesterday, we were
really friendly.

28:09.400 --> 28:12.510
As sweet and unassuming
as she appears, we definitely

28:12.570 --> 28:15.810
need to shift gears today.

28:15.880 --> 28:19.710
- All right, well,
here goes nothing.

28:19.780 --> 28:21.380
[knocking]

28:21.450 --> 28:23.950
- Come in.
- Hey, what's up, man?

28:24.020 --> 28:25.450
What's up, man?

28:25.520 --> 28:27.190
- How you guys doing today?
- All right.

28:27.260 --> 28:29.090
Maybe just a little nervous.

28:29.160 --> 28:31.590
Wait, why nervous?
- I don't know, just, like,

28:31.660 --> 28:33.890
this is all different.

28:36.570 --> 28:39.370
- Have a seat.

28:39.430 --> 28:41.370
- So how long do you think
this will take?

28:41.440 --> 28:44.870
- Why, you got big plans later?
- Yeah, I'm going to the store.

28:44.940 --> 28:46.310
- Before.
- You didn't used to go out

28:46.370 --> 28:48.140
to the store ever, right?
- Never.

28:48.210 --> 28:51.310
- Why do you think you didn't
leave the house for so long?

28:51.380 --> 28:54.650
- Because I'm safe inside.

28:56.750 --> 29:00.050
So I've stayed in,
taking care of my mom.

29:00.120 --> 29:04.560
- So how long?
- 12 years I was inside.

29:04.630 --> 29:07.690
I was a hermit.
A real one.

29:07.760 --> 29:10.800
- And what did you do, you know,
when you were here?

29:10.870 --> 29:16.170
- I was online,
just texting people.

29:16.240 --> 29:19.740
- Did your friends go on too,
or was this kind of like--

29:19.810 --> 29:23.080
- I didn't have any friends,
like, real friends?

29:23.150 --> 29:27.380
- Just people you knew.
- Oh, um, no.

29:27.450 --> 29:30.580
- All right, so maybe we
should go back and just sort of

29:30.650 --> 29:32.690
hear your version
of how everything

29:32.750 --> 29:35.760
sort of started
with Paris and Chris.

29:35.820 --> 29:39.930
- So I was on my
Facebook account,

29:40.000 --> 29:42.730
<i> and I see Chris,</i>
<i> the basketball player.</i>

29:42.800 --> 29:44.700
<i> He said they had a win.</i>

29:44.770 --> 29:47.800
<i> - That his team had a win?</i>
<i> - Yeah, on his status,</i>

29:47.870 --> 29:51.040
<i> and on the comments,</i>
<i> it showed Paris.</i>

29:51.110 --> 29:53.610
<i> She said, "Hey, text me</i>
<i> whenever," and she wrote</i>

29:53.680 --> 29:57.310
<i>her number there, and he wasn't</i>
<i> paying attention to her.</i>

29:57.380 --> 30:00.480
<i> So I texted Paris.</i>
<i> I said, "Hey, it's Chris."</i>

30:00.550 --> 30:04.120
And then I went to bed,
I left it alone, and I woke up,

30:04.190 --> 30:06.790
and she said,
"How was your day?"

30:06.860 --> 30:08.820
And I said, "It's okay.
How are you?"

30:08.890 --> 30:12.330
Like, it was like that.
And then she started

30:12.390 --> 30:16.900
sending pictures, and it started
to get uncomfortable.

30:16.970 --> 30:20.330
So I told my friend [bleep],
"I'm just gonna tell this girl

30:20.400 --> 30:22.000
I'm not really Chris."

30:22.070 --> 30:26.410
- Wait a second, who's [bleep]?
- The Texas woman.

30:26.470 --> 30:28.540
<i> ♪ ♪</i>

30:28.610 --> 30:31.580
<i> - I thought you were talking</i>
<i> to this woman in Texas as Tom.</i>

30:31.650 --> 30:33.850
- I'm always talking to her
as myself.

30:33.920 --> 30:36.620
I never talked to her as Tom.
- Never?

30:36.690 --> 30:38.720
- Never.
- Where would she even

30:38.790 --> 30:40.490
know about Tom?
The Tom character?

30:40.560 --> 30:43.020
- She knew about everything.
- So she knew that you had

30:43.090 --> 30:45.120
created a fake page...
- Yeah.

30:45.190 --> 30:48.130
- With a guy named Tom Taylor.
- Yeah, and she knew right away

30:48.200 --> 30:53.100
when I texted Paris.
She said, "Just get Chris

30:53.170 --> 30:55.940
<i> to notice Paris,</i>
<i> and give him her number."</i>

30:56.000 --> 30:59.140
- So the Texas woman suggested,
to get out of the uncomfortable

30:59.210 --> 31:01.880
place you were in, just put--
- Just hook them up.

31:01.940 --> 31:04.540
She said, "Hook them up."
And then, on day two,

31:04.610 --> 31:07.250
I sent him all the pictures
Paris sent.

31:07.320 --> 31:09.620
<i> He sent some back.</i>
<i> I sent them to her.</i>

31:09.680 --> 31:13.450
Within a few hours, he asked,
"Would you like to fly down?"

31:13.520 --> 31:15.290
Of course, Paris said yes.

31:15.360 --> 31:17.260
<i> She said,</i>
<i> "Oh, I'm at Chris' house."</i>

31:17.330 --> 31:21.290
And I said, "Prove it."
She sent me a bunch of pictures

31:21.360 --> 31:28.300
with a dog in his house, and
then he flew her home, and said,

31:28.370 --> 31:31.100
"We had fun.
I'd like to see you again."

31:31.170 --> 31:34.540
Then she freaked out
one morning.

31:34.610 --> 31:36.710
<i> Paris was swearing at me</i>
<i> and calling me</i>

31:36.780 --> 31:39.310
all kinds of names--well, him.
- Did you ever--

31:39.380 --> 31:42.480
- So I went on Facebook and seen
he was with somebody else.

31:42.550 --> 31:44.220
- With another girl?
- Yeah.

31:44.290 --> 31:46.420
- So that would've been
a great opportunity to end it.

31:46.490 --> 31:47.990
- Yeah.
- To like--

31:48.060 --> 31:50.120
- But she kept going on and on,
and I was trying

31:50.190 --> 31:52.860
to text somebody else,
and her thing kept popping up.

31:52.930 --> 31:56.430
I was annoyed, and I wanted her
to shut up and go away.

31:56.500 --> 31:59.130
<i> - And that's why you texted</i>
<i> those awful threats to Paris,</i>

31:59.200 --> 32:01.100
hoping she would go away.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

32:01.170 --> 32:04.170
- And then to kind of show her
that you meant business,

32:04.240 --> 32:06.810
you posted
those pictures of Paris.

32:06.880 --> 32:08.910
- Yeah, and I showed her.
- You showed her.

32:08.980 --> 32:11.480
And that's what made her
go to the cops.

32:11.550 --> 32:15.820
- Yeah, and then, one morning,
I seen on the news

32:15.880 --> 32:18.480
<i> where Chris' house got raided.</i>

32:18.550 --> 32:20.350
<i> And he just looked really bad.</i>

32:20.420 --> 32:22.160
- And so what did you feel
when you saw that?

32:22.220 --> 32:26.460
- Really bad and scared
for him and for me.

32:26.530 --> 32:30.200
That's when I started freaking
out and I said, "What do I do?"

32:30.270 --> 32:33.970
<i> My friend, the Texas woman,</i>

<i> but they dug deeper</i>

32:37.870 --> 32:39.870
and found me.

32:41.410 --> 32:44.680
- The most interesting thing
for me to hear is the difference

32:44.750 --> 32:47.710
in your story about this woman

the police describe
her involvement.

<i> ♪ ♪</i>

32:52.490 --> 32:55.320
She makes it sound, from her
interviews with the police--

32:55.920 --> 32:59.190
- That she's a victim, and that
she was in love with Tom

32:59.260 --> 33:01.260
and that he
sort of manipulated her.

33:01.330 --> 33:05.930
- Shelly, as this male persona,
really put this Texas woman

33:06.000 --> 33:08.200
through an emotional ringer.

33:08.270 --> 33:10.870
- And she was devastated

when she found it was you.
- Yeah, I know her story.

33:12.710 --> 33:16.680
- It was like we were there to
tell her that somebody had died.

33:16.750 --> 33:19.310
- Sounds like this woman
in Texas is telling you

33:19.380 --> 33:21.510
what to do a lot.
- Yeah.

33:21.580 --> 33:24.820
- And yet she seems to have been
painted as this victim.

33:24.890 --> 33:26.990
- I don't believe
she was a victim.

33:27.060 --> 33:29.160
- In fact, she was sort of
an active participant.

33:29.220 --> 33:33.190
- Yeah, she tried
to get $10,000 from him,

33:33.260 --> 33:35.600
and she admitted that
to the cops.

33:35.660 --> 33:41.700
So she said, "I'll negotiate
because he's worth millions."

33:41.770 --> 33:44.300
And one day,
she was in a meeting.

33:44.370 --> 33:48.540

okay, it's gonna be
$2,000 or $3,000.

34:15.340 --> 34:17.969

"You're a [bleep] idiot.
You could have gotten more.

34:21.639 --> 34:26.310
Like, you're so stupid."
So I said, "Well, just drop it,

- If that's true, and this woman
from Texas was trying

she'd be getting some of it?

34:49.239 --> 34:51.969
- Oh, we did get half.
- You were gonna split it?

34:52.040 --> 34:53.370
- We did split.
- They did split it.

34:53.440 --> 34:55.040
- Oh, you did split it.
- Yeah.

Gord did a pretty thorough
investigation.

the court documents we read or
from anyone that we talked to.

35:14.430 --> 35:16.300

35:16.360 --> 35:18.200

any information that

had anything to do with this.

35:30.150 --> 35:32.010

You're making this up.

35:36.580 --> 35:42.290
- Yeah, but I--I have no reason
to lie about this.

35:42.360 --> 35:46.860
I already did my time,
and you get what you get.

35:46.930 --> 35:50.160
If you don't like what you hear,
then believe her.

35:50.230 --> 35:52.700
- Right, but if what
you're saying is true,

35:52.770 --> 35:56.670
then that would mean that
a vast majority of the charges

35:56.740 --> 36:01.240
that you actually did
plead guilty to were shared--

36:01.310 --> 36:03.380
were shared with
the Texas woman.

36:03.440 --> 36:08.550
- I pled guilty because
I was pregnant at the time.

36:08.620 --> 36:10.980
And my husband was here.

36:11.050 --> 36:15.390
I was gonna fight this in trial,

36:15.460 --> 36:17.560
but I was told
"If you plead guilty, we will

36:17.630 --> 36:23.160
get you house arrest."
And then I got 18 months.

36:24.700 --> 36:27.300
- Oh, that's terrible, sorry.

36:27.370 --> 36:30.170

one more question?

36:33.440 --> 36:36.210
Why did you do it?

36:36.280 --> 36:39.480
I know you've said "bored,"
but what--

Were you doing it

36:45.790 --> 36:47.450
'cause it was
something to do?

36:47.520 --> 36:49.220
I think that that's
a big part of this.

36:49.290 --> 36:52.020
- I did it to see
if she would believe me

36:52.090 --> 36:54.090
at first.
And then I did it

36:54.160 --> 36:57.760

And then, I don't know.

My whole time in jail,

37:08.640 --> 37:12.950
I thought--
I kept thinking of what happened

37:13.010 --> 37:18.250
to Chris and Paris and why--
I don't know,

37:18.320 --> 37:21.420
I kept thinking, "Why the hell
did I message her?"

37:21.490 --> 37:26.190
I blamed her for the first
few months in jail.

37:26.260 --> 37:28.360
Like, I really hated her.

37:28.430 --> 37:31.060
I blamed the cops.
I blamed the judge.

37:31.130 --> 37:36.470
I blamed my lawyer,
but I realized that

37:36.540 --> 37:39.340
I can only blame me.

37:39.410 --> 37:42.240
And then, when I got out,
people kept asking me,

37:42.310 --> 37:46.910
"Do you think about it?
Have you thought about it?

37:46.980 --> 37:49.350
Do you think about it?"
- Just like I'm asking you now.

37:49.420 --> 37:51.420
- Mm-hmm.

for the crimes

38:35.930 --> 38:38.900
you committed there?

38:38.970 --> 38:41.330
- I think I did my time.

38:41.400 --> 38:45.070
A year is a lot to waste
out of a human life.

38:45.140 --> 38:51.140
And those people should look
at themselves and--and think of

38:51.210 --> 38:54.610
the biggest mistake in their
life and wonder,
