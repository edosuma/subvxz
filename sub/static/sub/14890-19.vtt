Balki, you’ll never guess
what just happened.

02:14.467 --> 02:18.204
I was sitting at the lunch
counter and in walked the mayor.

02:18.238 --> 02:20.306
Get out of the city council.

02:22.242 --> 02:24.377
‐Di‐did you talk to him?
‐Talk to him?

02:24.410 --> 02:26.580
I went right up to him,
introduced myself.

02:26.613 --> 02:27.681
He looked me right in the eye

02:27.714 --> 02:30.350
and said, "Don’t bother me
while I’m eating".

02:32.318 --> 02:33.787
I know I made a good impression.

02:33.820 --> 02:36.957
I could tell as they were
dragging me away from the table.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.726
‐So what did you do for lunch?
‐Well, uh, just the usual.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.895
I went to the lunch truck
and got a soda.

02:41.928 --> 02:44.598
I went to the Wilcox building
and got a job offer

02:44.631 --> 02:46.667
went to the park
and fed the pigeons.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.735
‐You did what?
‐I fed the pigeons.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.604
And, cousin, the little pigeon
with the broken wing?

02:50.637 --> 02:52.539
I got him to eat out of my hand.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.908
The job offer!
Tell me about the job offer!

02:54.941 --> 02:56.442
Oh, there’s not much to tell.

02:56.476 --> 02:58.579
Uh, Mr. Beekman,
the building manager

02:58.612 --> 03:00.881
wants me to be
the head of the mailroom.

03:00.914 --> 03:03.784
Balki, that is great!

03:03.817 --> 03:05.218
More money?

03:05.251 --> 03:07.588
Well, um, mm‐mm yeah.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.590
Uh, about twice
what I’m making now.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.725
And, cousin, the little pigeon

03:11.758 --> 03:13.493
I‐I think he’s got a girlfriend.

03:15.562 --> 03:18.298
Well, Balki, when do they want
you to start your new job?

03:18.331 --> 03:21.902
Oh, I...I’m not sure
I’m gonna take the new job.

03:21.935 --> 03:24.738
Oh! Oh!
Oh, holding out for more money.

03:24.771 --> 03:26.673
‐I taught you well.
‐It’s not the money.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.609
And you never taught me
Bo Diddley.

03:30.644 --> 03:32.813
It’s just that I’m not sure
I want a new job.

03:32.846 --> 03:35.281
If I leave here
I’d miss all my old friends.

03:35.315 --> 03:36.850
Well, Balki,
you’ll make new friends.

03:36.883 --> 03:40.521
At double your salary
you can buy new friends!

03:40.554 --> 03:41.888
Take the job!

03:41.922 --> 03:44.457
Cousin, don’t pressure cook me.

03:47.628 --> 03:50.463
On Mypos we, we don’t,
we don’t rush into decisions.

03:50.496 --> 03:52.365
We, we just give them
a lot of care

03:52.398 --> 03:54.334
and thought and preparation.

03:54.367 --> 03:56.670
Well, I guess
that makes sense.

03:56.703 --> 03:59.506
So on Mypos, when you’re faced
with a major decision

03:59.540 --> 04:01.942
you climb to the top
of Mount Mypos

04:01.975 --> 04:06.446
and then you just sit there and
wait for a sign from Destiniki.

04:08.314 --> 04:09.415
Destiniki?

04:09.449 --> 04:11.017
The God of Decisions.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.786
He lives in the clouds

04:12.819 --> 04:16.557
attended by his guitar playing
daughter Domoniki.

04:18.391 --> 04:19.526
Niki Niki.

04:22.629 --> 04:24.397
Well, well,
so what do you do?

04:24.430 --> 04:25.999
Just stand around and wait

04:26.032 --> 04:27.968
for a telegram
to drop out of the sky?

04:28.001 --> 04:31.437
Well, of course not!
Don’t be ridiculous!

04:31.471 --> 04:34.340
When Destiniki determines that
your decision is a done deal

04:34.374 --> 04:35.909
you don’t dare doubt him, dude.

04:37.944 --> 04:41.347
You feel a tap
on your shoulder

04:41.381 --> 04:44.651
right there and then you feel

04:44.685 --> 04:48.321
someone turns you around
three times.

04:49.990 --> 04:53.426
And then you hear a voice
whispering in this ear...

04:54.427 --> 04:56.563
...and that’s your answer.

04:56.597 --> 04:59.032
Then of course you fall down
on your knees and give thanks.

05:01.835 --> 05:05.405
That’s the stupidest thing
I ever heard.

05:05.438 --> 05:08.909
Getting your decision from
some spirit named Desenexos.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.445
Destiniki.

05:12.478 --> 05:14.848
Desenexos is the healer
of foot fungus.

05:18.885 --> 05:19.986
Well, I stand corrected.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.022
‐Well...
‐But it’s still stupid.

05:22.055 --> 05:25.726
And even if it weren’t stupid,
and I’m not giving that up...

05:25.759 --> 05:27.694
Now, that you’re in Chicago
the chances of you finding

05:27.728 --> 05:30.063
a mountain to climb
are pretty slim.

05:30.096 --> 05:32.032
[scoffs]
Ha.

05:34.801 --> 05:36.770
You pouting Thomas.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.372
I find my mountain.

05:39.405 --> 05:41.041
Now if you’ll excuse me

05:41.074 --> 05:43.443
I have to go home
and prepare myself

05:43.476 --> 05:45.478
for Destiniki’s visitation.

05:45.512 --> 05:48.649
First thing I’m gonna do, I’m
gonna soak in a tub of Ovaltine.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.886
What is that?
Some kinda purification ritual?

05:52.919 --> 05:54.387
No, it just opens my pores.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.095
‐Appleton?
‐’Ye‐yes, sir, Mr. Wainwright?’

06:02.128 --> 06:04.631
Believe it or not I finally
liked one of those memos

06:04.665 --> 06:06.767
you slip under my door
every day.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.969
Well, thank you, sir.
Uh, which one did you like?

06:09.002 --> 06:11.505
I like the idea about
having someone from the paper

06:11.538 --> 06:15.041
live on a billboard until
the Bulls losing streak is over.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.843
I want to
implement it immediately.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.645
Oh, great!
Who volunteered to do it?

06:18.679 --> 06:21.114
Nobody volunteered.
It’s the middle of winter.

06:21.147 --> 06:23.617
It’s your job to get an employee
up on that billboard

06:23.650 --> 06:25.051
by game time tomorrow.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.053
I’ve alerted the television
stations for coverage

06:27.087 --> 06:28.622
and I’ve arranged
to use the billboard

06:28.655 --> 06:30.456
on the top of
the McIntosh building.

06:30.490 --> 06:32.458
Well, who am I gonna get
on such short notice?

06:32.492 --> 06:34.761
There’s always you.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.462
W‐well, I’m, I’m very busy
right now, sir

06:36.496 --> 06:39.199
a‐a‐a‐and I‐I have this little
problem with, uh, high places.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.634
They terrify me.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.135
They, they make me
hyperventilate.

06:42.168 --> 06:43.804
They, they make me feel
like I’m having a heart attack.

06:43.837 --> 06:44.838
That’s your problem.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.108
Just get somebody up there
by 1 o’clock

06:48.141 --> 06:49.543
tomorrow afternoon
or it’s your job!

06:49.576 --> 06:51.177
Uh, yes, yes, sir! 1 o’clock!

06:51.211 --> 06:53.013
I have the perfect man
for the job!

06:59.886 --> 07:02.823
[instrumental music]

07:04.224 --> 07:06.860
Balki! Balki. Come out here!
I have to talk to you.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.609
‐Balki?
‐Yeah?

07:22.643 --> 07:25.211
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

07:30.684 --> 07:33.820
Balki...where are you going?

07:33.854 --> 07:36.156
Cousin, I found the mountain,
and with any luck

07:36.189 --> 07:38.692
Destiniki will find me
and he’ll come down

07:38.725 --> 07:40.894
and he’ll tap me
on the shoulder, right there

07:40.927 --> 07:42.563
and then he’ll turn me around
three times...

07:45.666 --> 07:49.135
...and then he’ll whisper
my decision in my ear.

07:49.169 --> 07:53.640
So, uh, if you’ll excuse me,
I have a twelve hour bus ride

07:53.674 --> 07:55.075
ahead of me to Mount Woolaroc.

08:04.117 --> 08:05.952
Balki, you can’t
go to Mount Woolaroc.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.993
Mount Woolaroc
is an Indian name meaning

08:13.026 --> 08:14.995
"Mountain Where Bad
Decisions are Made."

08:16.329 --> 08:18.699
General Custer
sat on Mount Woolaroc

08:18.732 --> 08:21.201
and decided to fight
the Indians.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.203
Somebody from the Coca Cola
company went up there

08:23.236 --> 08:25.271
and decided to change
the original formula.

08:27.741 --> 08:30.143
Shelley Long goes up there
to decide which movies to make.

08:31.812 --> 08:32.813
Well, cousin...

08:37.317 --> 08:41.722
Thank you. You saved me a long
trip to make a bad decision.

08:41.755 --> 08:44.190
Although...would’ve been
nice to meet Shelley.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.160
Well, I’m just glad
I could help.

08:47.193 --> 08:48.294
Well, you only half helped,
cousin, now I...

08:49.295 --> 08:50.797
...I have nowhere to go.

08:52.999 --> 08:54.568
Well, alright,
alright, don’t panic.

08:54.601 --> 08:56.637
We’ll think of something.
Alright, let’s see.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.338
Where could you go?

08:58.371 --> 09:02.576
A high place
...waiting for a sign.

09:02.609 --> 09:05.345
High place...sign.

09:05.378 --> 09:09.182
High...sign.
High sign...

09:09.215 --> 09:12.719
Placing yourself
on a high sign...

09:13.386 --> 09:15.255
I’ve got it!

09:15.288 --> 09:17.958
The billboard on the top
of the McIntosh building!

09:17.991 --> 09:20.627
It’s a high place, it’s on a
sign, you get an overview...

09:20.661 --> 09:22.696
‐No, it would never work.
‐Cousin! Cousin!

09:22.729 --> 09:24.831
Don’t you see the poetry of it?

09:24.865 --> 09:27.734
Waiting for a sign on a sign!

09:27.768 --> 09:30.370
‐Do you think so?
‐Cousin, I think it’s perfect!

09:30.403 --> 09:33.006
Well. Alright, if you feel
that strongly about it

09:33.039 --> 09:34.741
I’m not gonna stand in your way.

09:34.775 --> 09:37.243
You know, now that I think about
it, it does make sense.

09:37.277 --> 09:38.879
I mean,
you get a good night’s sleep

09:38.912 --> 09:40.947
you go up there
just in time for tip‐off...

09:40.981 --> 09:42.348
Did I say "Tip‐off?"
I meant "Take off."

09:42.382 --> 09:46.019
Take off about 12:30,
12:45 at the latest.

09:46.052 --> 09:48.755
Oh, cousin, I don’t know
how to thank you.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.757
‐Hey, buddy, I’m here for ya.
‐Oh, boy.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.067
[upbeat music]

10:11.077 --> 10:13.113
I’ll just, uh...

10:13.146 --> 10:16.082
...help you get settled up here,
then I’ll be on my way.

10:16.116 --> 10:19.252
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Don’t look down.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.988
Don’t look down, Balki.

10:22.022 --> 10:23.924
Whatever you do,
just don’t look down.

10:27.360 --> 10:30.363
Okay! I did it!
You can do it, Balki.

10:30.396 --> 10:32.666
Just as long as you don’t
look down, you’ll be okay.

Hey, cousin, you know what?
You were right. This is perfect.

11:07.934 --> 11:09.936
I know I’m gonna reach
a great decision up here.

11:16.342 --> 11:17.343
You know what?

11:19.045 --> 11:22.348
This reminds me of Mount Mypos.
Absolutely.

11:22.382 --> 11:25.385
Except there are,
there are no goats and no...

11:25.418 --> 11:28.254
...no eagles nests and
no threat of volcanic eruption

11:28.288 --> 11:31.892
and, uh, actually it‐it doesn’t
remind me at all of Mount Mypos

11:31.925 --> 11:34.194
but I love it! I just love it,
love it, love it!

11:34.227 --> 11:37.097

my little pigeon friends

11:56.149 --> 11:57.984
Steve and Eydie,
ever come up here?

11:58.018 --> 11:59.385
Will you forget about
Steve and Eydie?

Well, I just want them
to know what a nice

12:12.533 --> 12:14.067
And then I’ll find you

12:49.302 --> 12:51.838
Well, Balki, there’s more
than a little interest...

12:51.872 --> 12:53.339
...in your decision
about your new job.

12:54.941 --> 12:57.210
As soon as I know, you’ll know!

12:57.243 --> 13:00.280
Balki...they can’t hear you.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.816
Alright, well, I’ll just,
uh, leave you up here

13:02.849 --> 13:04.117
and let you get settled.

13:05.251 --> 13:07.420
‐Cousin, what do you want?
‐’Hmm?’

13:07.453 --> 13:09.089
Didn’t you just tap me
on the shoulder?

13:09.122 --> 13:10.123
No.

13:12.926 --> 13:17.197
Start in on your decision,
and take all the time you need.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.600
It’s not something
you wanna rush into.

13:19.633 --> 13:22.869
If it were me, I’d take two,
maybe three weeks.

13:26.472 --> 13:29.009
Well, I can see you’re involved
in some kind of meditation.

13:29.042 --> 13:31.377
So...I’ll be on my way.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.379
No, cousin, that won’t be
necessary. I’m coming with you!

13:33.413 --> 13:35.315
‐No, Balki! Get off.
‐Cousin, let me‐‐

13:35.348 --> 13:37.383
Get off! Get off!
Get off the ladder!

13:40.253 --> 13:41.254
[screaming]

13:45.592 --> 13:47.260
What is the matter with you?

13:47.293 --> 13:49.495
You‐you have an important
decision to make.

13:49.530 --> 13:50.531
You have to stay here.

13:50.564 --> 13:53.867
Cousin, Destiniki was here!
I have my answer!

13:53.900 --> 13:57.103
Cousin, can’t you see my new
found knowledge has me glowing

13:57.137 --> 13:58.505
like my Pee Wee Herman
night light?

14:02.943 --> 14:04.110
Alright, Balki,
you can’t do this.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.912
This is much too important
a decision.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.614
‐Well, you can’t stop me.
‐Well, Balki.

14:07.648 --> 14:09.516
You have to stay here.

14:09.550 --> 14:11.284
‐No, I don’t.
‐Yes, you do.

14:11.317 --> 14:13.253
‐No, I don’t.
‐Yes, you do.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.122
[crashing]

14:16.156 --> 14:17.223
Yes, I do.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.365
[upbeat music]

14:30.403 --> 14:33.206
My heart wants to believe
that, that was an accident.

14:33.239 --> 14:36.577
However, my eyes
saw you deliberately

14:36.610 --> 14:38.011
kick that ladder down.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.313
I did it for you.

14:40.346 --> 14:41.682
I did it to keep you
from rushing into

14:41.715 --> 14:44.117
a bad career decision.

14:44.150 --> 14:46.186
I mean, shouldn’t you
be getting another opinion?

14:46.219 --> 14:48.221
Isn’t there someone
else you can call?

14:48.254 --> 14:49.322
Opinioniki?

14:52.959 --> 14:54.227
Futurini?

14:55.529 --> 14:58.164
What‐should‐I‐do‐ko‐nou‐ko‐niki?

14:58.198 --> 15:00.366
Listen, I want
the truth and I want it now.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.401
Alright.

15:03.003 --> 15:05.105
There’s a crazed assassin
loose in the Chronicle

15:05.138 --> 15:09.075
and he’s after you and this is
the only place you’ll be safe.

15:09.109 --> 15:11.077
Cut the babasticki!

15:13.046 --> 15:14.180
Alright, alright.

15:14.214 --> 15:16.717
Alright, the real truth,
the real, real truth.

15:16.750 --> 15:19.219
But I want you to know,
I resent being pushed this far.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.658
I‐I suggested to Wainwright
that, that somebody live

15:24.691 --> 15:27.460
on this billboard until
the Bulls losing streak ended

15:27.493 --> 15:29.462
and he loved the idea and told
me to get someone to do it.

15:29.495 --> 15:31.064
Well, I‐I’m afraid of heights

15:31.097 --> 15:33.199
so I tricked you
into coming up here.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.401
Liar, liar, pants for hire!

15:37.103 --> 15:39.372
Will you just tell me the truth?

15:39.405 --> 15:41.675
Balki, that is the truth!

15:41.708 --> 15:43.610
Doesn’t it sound
like something I would do?

15:43.644 --> 15:46.980
It’s selfish,
manipulative, uncaring...

15:47.013 --> 15:49.382
It does kind of sound
like something you would do

15:49.415 --> 15:52.085
but usually I have
to threaten you

15:52.118 --> 15:54.187
with bodily harm
to get the truth.

15:54.220 --> 15:55.589
No, Balki, that’s the truth.

15:55.622 --> 15:58.324
So...

15:58.358 --> 16:00.460
...you, you didn’t care
anything about my future?

16:00.493 --> 16:03.296
You, you just used Balki?

16:03.329 --> 16:05.298
I’m sorry, I’m sorry.

16:05.331 --> 16:10.203
I‐I’m sorry I‐I lied and I
promise I’ll never do it again.

16:11.672 --> 16:12.673
Pfft!

16:15.208 --> 16:18.044
Alright, I’ll try never
to do it again.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.280
Pfft!

16:22.282 --> 16:25.185
Alright, I’ll try never
to do it again, today.

16:26.753 --> 16:29.289
Well, I guess that’s
as close as we’re gonna get.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.660
I forgive you.

16:33.694 --> 16:35.128
Thank you.

16:38.064 --> 16:39.332
[screaming]

16:43.737 --> 16:47.073
Well, I‐I’m glad we got
that straightened out.

16:47.107 --> 16:48.575
But we’re still stuck
on the billboard...

16:48.609 --> 16:51.111
Not necessarily,
if the Bulls win

16:51.144 --> 16:53.747
someone will be up here to get
us and we’ll be home free.

16:53.780 --> 16:56.416
The game’s on now,
did you bring a radio?

16:56.449 --> 16:59.586
Well, of course I did,
don’t be ridiculous.

16:59.620 --> 17:01.555
The TV wouldn’t fit
in my backpack.

17:08.127 --> 17:10.296
(man on radio)
’What a basketball game
we have here!’

17:10.329 --> 17:12.232
’At a record setting pace
the Bulls have scored’

17:12.265 --> 17:14.635
’22 unanswered points,
the score at the end of’

17:14.667 --> 17:18.104
’the first quarter is Bulls,
thirty four. Nicks, six.’

17:18.137 --> 17:19.305
Did you hear that, Balki?

17:19.339 --> 17:21.207
The Bulls have a huge lead.

17:21.241 --> 17:24.477
Another couple of hours we’ll be
in our nice, safe apartment.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.146
[upbeat music]

17:32.853 --> 17:35.321
I can’t believe the Bulls

17:35.355 --> 17:38.224
blew a 28 point lead.

17:40.393 --> 17:44.397
Cousin, I’ve been listening
to that for two days.

17:44.430 --> 17:46.299
If you say it one more time

17:46.332 --> 17:48.068
I’m gonna throw you
off the billboard.

17:49.570 --> 17:50.771
I’m sorry,
I won’t mention it again.

17:50.804 --> 17:52.072
Alright.

18:11.357 --> 18:13.293
Yep, fresh as a tulip.

18:16.429 --> 18:19.332
Cousin, you haven’t even
touched your breakfast.

18:19.365 --> 18:21.502
Your yak links are getting cold.

18:21.535 --> 18:24.671
Balki, please. I don’t wanna
look at another yak link.

18:24.705 --> 18:26.673
I am sick of yak links.

18:26.707 --> 18:28.709
Didn’t you bring
any other kind of food?

18:28.742 --> 18:32.412
Cousin, yak links
are nature’s perfect food.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.881
I have to get off
this billboard.

18:34.915 --> 18:37.518
Balki, if we stay up here
we’re gonna freeze to death.

18:37.551 --> 18:41.487
Well, cousin,
think of it this way.

18:41.522 --> 18:44.157
There’s another game tonight,
if the Bulls win

18:44.190 --> 18:45.926
then we can be home
in time for supper.

18:45.959 --> 18:48.328
You’re right, you’re right.

18:48.361 --> 18:49.630
We still have a chance.

18:49.663 --> 18:53.700
Any team with Michael Jordan
is bound to win.

18:53.734 --> 18:56.703
(man on radio)
’Good afternoon and welcome
to the Bulls pre‐game show.’

18:56.737 --> 18:58.605
’And a special hello
to those two guys on’

18:58.639 --> 19:00.907
’the billboard waiting
for the Bulls to win.’

19:00.941 --> 19:02.509
Cousin, that’s us!

19:02.543 --> 19:04.811
He, he mentioned us!
We’re famous!

19:04.845 --> 19:06.847
’And another special hello
to Michael Jordan’

19:06.880 --> 19:08.749
’who is home
in bed with the flu.’

19:08.782 --> 19:09.783
What?

19:11.718 --> 19:14.788
’Luckily, the Bulls only have to
play one game without Michael.’

19:14.821 --> 19:16.857
’They’ve got a five day
layoff after today’

19:16.890 --> 19:18.659
’and that should be plenty
of time for him to get back’

19:18.692 --> 19:19.826
’on his feet.’

19:19.860 --> 19:21.862
’This is good news
for everybody’

19:21.895 --> 19:24.531
’except those
two jerks on the billboard.’

19:26.567 --> 19:27.934
Cousin, he mentioned us again!

19:27.968 --> 19:29.703
I don’t believe this!

19:33.840 --> 19:34.908
[tires screeching]

19:38.244 --> 19:41.515
Balki, I can’t stay up
here another five days.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.917
I can’t stay up here
another five minutes!

19:43.950 --> 19:45.852
We’ve gotta get
off this billboard.

19:45.886 --> 19:48.321
If we stay up here,
we’ll either freeze to death

19:48.354 --> 19:50.423
or the wind will blow us off.

19:50.456 --> 19:53.994
‐Balki, I have...a plan.
‐Oh, God!

19:54.027 --> 19:56.229
Do you see how close the blades
of the windmill come

19:56.262 --> 19:57.931
to that radio
transmitting tower?

19:57.964 --> 19:59.766
’Now if we can get on one
of those blades’

19:59.800 --> 20:02.969
we can reach out, grab
the transmitter and climb down.

20:03.003 --> 20:04.705
But, cousin,
what if we fall off?

20:04.738 --> 20:06.472
Then we’ll be
in a nice warm hospital!

20:06.507 --> 20:09.009
Alright. Ready?

20:09.042 --> 20:11.812
Now, when the blades come
around, I’ll grab the first one.

20:11.845 --> 20:13.847
You grab the second one,
hang on tight till it

20:13.880 --> 20:16.449
swings us over to
the transmitter, then grab on!

20:16.482 --> 20:17.551
Got it.

20:24.324 --> 20:25.592
Oh, no!

20:28.595 --> 20:30.030
Help!

20:30.063 --> 20:33.734
‐Whoa, whoa, whoa,
‐Balki, can you reach it?

20:33.767 --> 20:36.737
No, I cannot!
Can you reach it?

20:36.770 --> 20:37.771
No!

20:39.940 --> 20:43.777
You know, cousin, this reminds
me of the Myposian World’s Fair.

20:43.810 --> 20:46.880
They, they had one
rather large woman on it.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.882
"The Human Rotisserie."

20:48.915 --> 20:51.718
’Help!’

20:51.752 --> 20:53.754
’Mama! Help!’

20:56.022 --> 20:57.290
[upbeat music]

21:00.326 --> 21:04.430
"Chronicle employees Larry
Appleton and Balki Bartokomous

21:04.464 --> 21:07.834
"cling to the windmill on
the Holland deodorant sign

21:07.868 --> 21:09.870
shortly before their rescue."

21:12.072 --> 21:13.874
I look like a bat.

21:15.709 --> 21:18.378
This is all my fault.

21:18.411 --> 21:21.915
If I hadn’t smashed the radio
into a million pieces

21:21.948 --> 21:25.519
we would’ve heard that
the Bulls won the game

21:25.552 --> 21:27.954
without Michael Jordan.

21:27.988 --> 21:30.657
And we wouldn’t have gotten
stuck on that stupid windmill.

21:31.892 --> 21:33.560
Well, look on
the bright side, cousin.

21:33.594 --> 21:35.095
We got sprayed with
so much deodorant

21:35.128 --> 21:36.597
we’ll never sweat again.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.334
Appleton! Bartokomous!

21:41.367 --> 21:43.504
Nice work on that promotion,
boys.

21:43.537 --> 21:45.672
It’s a great idea, Appleton,
it created a lot of publicity

21:45.706 --> 21:47.407
for the paper and for the Bulls.

21:47.440 --> 21:51.512
Well, thank you, sir,
but Balki deserves the credit.

21:51.545 --> 21:53.747
Well, then, I guess I’ll give
you these, Bartokomous.

21:53.780 --> 21:56.683
Thank you, Mr. Wainwright.
What is it?

21:56.717 --> 21:59.419
The Bulls were so pleased with
the publicity they’ve given you

21:59.452 --> 22:02.355
two courtside seats for
the remainder of the season.

22:02.388 --> 22:03.924
Oh, Mr. Wainwright!

22:05.626 --> 22:08.094
Thank you so much.

22:08.128 --> 22:09.462
Enjoy them.

22:10.597 --> 22:11.798
Oh, ho!

22:14.635 --> 22:17.771
Balki, I‐I’m sorry
for all the trouble

22:17.804 --> 22:19.873
I’ve caused you
the last couple of days.

22:19.906 --> 22:21.374
Oh, that’s okay, cousin

22:21.407 --> 22:23.409
but I have a bigger problem
to solve now.

22:23.443 --> 22:25.045
Well, what’s that?

22:25.078 --> 22:28.048
Well, I have to figure out
who to give the other ticket to.

22:28.081 --> 22:30.951
That’s a big decision,
I guess I’m pretty much

22:30.984 --> 22:32.886
on my way back up
to that billboard.

22:43.964 --> 22:45.899
Oh, come on, cousin,
I’m just teasing

22:45.932 --> 22:47.668
of course you can have
the other ticket.
