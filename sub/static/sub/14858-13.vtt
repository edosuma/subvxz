18:36.574 --> 18:37.109
"To sleep is just
to leave your touch.

J My love has come along I

19:04.143 --> 19:08.057
So pretty intense convo

19:08.356 --> 19:10.768
What? No. That?
| was just--

19:11.067 --> 19:12.273
| was saying anything
| could to get her

19:12.568 --> 19:13.808
to come back out
to the wedding.

19:14.111 --> 19:15.601
| was this close
to knocking her over the head

19:15.905 --> 19:17.612
and walking her out
like Weekend At Bernie's style.

19:17.907 --> 19:20.114
I And life is like a song J

Mm. You okay?

19:39.804 --> 19:42.421
Yeah. I'm not emotional
about Shershow.

19:42.723 --> 19:44.680
<i>I'm emotional
because of your ceremony.</i>

19:44.975 --> 19:46.340
It was genius

19:46.644 --> 19:47.179
to go Neruda after Sade

19:48.229 --> 19:49.719
after quotes
from dead grandparents.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.012
You nailed it.

19:51.315 --> 19:53.682
Penny, my job as a man
of the cloth

19:53.984 --> 19:55.440
is to create a bridge

19:55.736 --> 19:57.147
between the congregation
and the couple

19:57.446 --> 20:00.484
built on honesty
and mutual respect.

20:00.783 --> 20:03.070

and shrimp fountain.

You were so close to having
a perfect wedding.

20:39.155 --> 20:40.566
Why'd you give it up?

20:40.865 --> 20:42.651
The fact that you were willing
to go along with me on this

20:42.950 --> 20:45.817
made me realize I don't need
the perfect wedding.

20:46.120 --> 20:47.485
| have the perfect husband.
Aw.

20:47.788 --> 20:51.156
