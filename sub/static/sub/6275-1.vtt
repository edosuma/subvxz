11:59.375 --> 12:00.792
Did you see that tranny?

12:00.875 --> 12:02.417
I would have fucked that tranny.

12:02.500 --> 12:04.458
You drop the fag stuff,
I will give you

12:04.542 --> 12:05.959
the first interview with him
from rehab.

12:07.041 --> 12:09.208
MAN:
There he is! There
he is! Tommy! Tommy!

12:09.291 --> 12:11.291
(clamoring)

12:11.375 --> 12:14.166
Want to make a statement, Tommy?
Tommy Wheeler, look at me!

12:14.250 --> 12:17.000
Tommy, look at me!
What happened over there?

12:17.083 --> 12:18.667
(clamoring)

12:18.750 --> 12:20.291
(women squealing)

12:20.375 --> 12:23.417
Tommy, want to make a statement?
Tommy, look over here.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.625
(clamoring continues)

12:48.750 --> 12:52.041
I've been seeing this chick.
I want you to follow her.

12:52.125 --> 12:54.041
See if she's fucking
around on me.

12:55.875 --> 13:00.166
I'm married.
Lee told you that, right?

13:01.750 --> 13:05.166
You think I'm a scumbag, right?

13:05.250 --> 13:08.000
Married, but I'm fucking around
with this chick?

13:08.083 --> 13:10.458
I'm not here to judge you.
It's not what I do.

13:10.542 --> 13:12.041
You think I don't
know what you do?

13:12.125 --> 13:15.333
Lee said
you're the best in town.

13:18.375 --> 13:21.000
I love my wife...

13:21.083 --> 13:25.333
but this chick...
has her claws in me.

13:27.500 --> 13:28.709
My wife doesn't want to have sex
with me anymore.

13:28.792 --> 13:32.125
I don't feel good about myself.

13:32.208 --> 13:34.625
(phone buzzing)

13:34.709 --> 13:36.208
You ever do
growth hormone?

13:36.291 --> 13:38.208
No.

13:42.125 --> 13:45.667
(stammers)
You think it's Kabbalah, right?

13:45.750 --> 13:48.208
It's not. It's-It's to remind me

13:48.291 --> 13:50.458
it's the hand of taking,
you know?

13:50.542 --> 13:52.125
It should be the hand of giving.

13:52.208 --> 13:53.917
You know, I want to give more.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.333
I don't want
her to know

13:56.417 --> 13:58.083
that I'm having her followed.

13:58.166 --> 13:58.542
She has trust issues.

13:58.625 --> 14:01.000
No problem.

14:01.083 --> 14:02.834
She was one of
those Disney kids.

14:02.917 --> 14:04.250
Parents stole all her money.

14:04.333 --> 14:07.291
Now she's a singer.

14:07.375 --> 14:08.792
Like Britney.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.166
All right, good, good, good!

14:17.500 --> 14:21.166
You don't talk a lot.
I like that.

14:21.250 --> 14:23.125
I'm gonna start doing that.

14:23.208 --> 14:26.208
Makes you very
mysterious.

14:26.291 --> 14:29.542
I think I give away
my power too much.

14:29.625 --> 14:31.041
I'll be in touch.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.125
(dispenser whirs)

14:43.333 --> 14:44.834
I'm gonna go sit
on Feldman's girl.

14:44.917 --> 14:47.333
Okay.
Terry's called three times.

14:47.417 --> 14:49.166
All right,
see if you can get him.

14:52.208 --> 14:55.792
That's it. You go to the
body, then you move upstairs.

14:55.875 --> 14:58.583
Everything behind
the jab, okay?

14:58.667 --> 15:03.291
MAN:
Yo, Terry! Terry!
Your brother's on the phone!

15:03.375 --> 15:05.250
Which?
Ray.

15:20.917 --> 15:22.458
What's up?

15:22.542 --> 15:24.375
RAY:
What's going on, Ter?

15:24.458 --> 15:25.792
Bunchy had a slip.

15:29.083 --> 15:30.709
Where is he?

15:30.792 --> 15:34.542
MAN:
He was a big,
charismatic guy.

15:34.625 --> 15:37.000
Tells my parents
I'm an athlete.

15:37.083 --> 15:40.041
This was a big deal
in my family,

15:40.125 --> 15:43.375
a priest paying attention to me.

15:43.458 --> 15:45.250
I was, I was so flattered.

15:45.333 --> 15:46.166
Takes me to
this health club

15:46.250 --> 15:49.375
and tells me we have
to shower first.

15:49.458 --> 15:51.000
Motherfucker.

15:51.083 --> 15:55.125
And that was the first
time he molested me.

15:56.834 --> 16:00.667
I come into the house,
and my mother says, uh...

16:02.917 --> 16:05.208
She says, "How was it,
Kev? Was it thrilling?"

16:08.208 --> 16:11.834
I'm gonna tell my mother
that this man raped me?

16:11.917 --> 16:12.625
This man's
next to God.

16:12.709 --> 16:15.166
(phone ringing)

16:15.250 --> 16:16.291
That's God's representative
on Earth.

16:23.083 --> 16:23.709
Hey.

16:23.792 --> 16:26.458
RAY:
Hey, Bunch, what's up?

16:26.542 --> 16:28.625
You talk to Terry yet?

16:28.709 --> 16:30.125
Yeah.

16:30.208 --> 16:31.875
What's going on, Bunchy?
Talk to me.

16:31.959 --> 16:34.333
My settlement just came through.

16:34.417 --> 16:36.792
$1.4 million 'cause
some priest messed around

16:36.875 --> 16:39.500
with me when I was a kid.

16:39.583 --> 16:42.208
I thought I'd be so happy
when the money came.

16:42.291 --> 16:45.583
You want me to send someone?
Come get you?

16:45.667 --> 16:46.917
Send someone?

16:47.000 --> 16:51.959
Nah, I ain't done drinking yet.

17:12.542 --> 17:14.875
(dog barking)

17:35.500 --> 17:37.041
I got his plates.

17:37.125 --> 17:39.750
I'm gonna call it in
to Lena for an address.

17:40.792 --> 17:42.166
I got a bad feeling.

17:45.875 --> 17:46.709
Ray, what are
you doing?

17:46.792 --> 17:49.291
You can't fucking
do that.

17:51.083 --> 17:54.000
You said you weren't
gonna do this shit anymore.

17:54.083 --> 17:58.542
She's not the client!
Stu Feldman's the client!

17:58.625 --> 18:00.709
(knocking)

18:03.625 --> 18:05.083
Jesus, Ray Donovan!

18:05.166 --> 18:07.333
You always open the door
like that?

18:07.417 --> 18:09.166
Without asking
who it is?

18:09.250 --> 18:09.834
I do when it's you.

18:09.917 --> 18:11.667
How the hell
are you, Ray?

18:11.750 --> 18:13.083
Pretty good.

18:13.166 --> 18:16.542
You?
Better than the last time
I saw you.

18:16.625 --> 18:19.333
What was I, like, 16?

18:19.417 --> 18:23.000
Trying to get my fucking money
back from my parents.

18:23.083 --> 18:25.959
Assholes.

18:26.041 --> 18:26.667
Did I ever
thank you?

18:26.750 --> 18:30.166
You tried.

18:30.250 --> 18:32.000
(chuckles)

18:32.083 --> 18:34.834
So, what are you doing here,
Ray?

18:34.917 --> 18:36.917
You have a stalker.

18:37.792 --> 18:39.375
Right. That was good.

18:39.458 --> 18:41.041
I'm, like, being punked, right?

18:41.125 --> 18:43.375
No.

19:00.208 --> 19:01.542
ASHLEY:
So, what, I'm supposed

19:01.625 --> 19:04.166
to look over my shoulder
every minute now?

19:04.250 --> 19:09.041
How did you even
know about him?

19:09.125 --> 19:12.875
Look at me.
It's Stu, isn't it?

19:12.959 --> 19:15.709
He hired you to spy on me?

19:15.792 --> 19:16.250
Yeah.

19:18.375 --> 19:20.417
Fucking asshole!

19:20.500 --> 19:23.959
He's married.
Did you know that?

19:25.333 --> 19:26.291
What does he want
from me?

19:26.375 --> 19:30.291
I've had guys jerking off
to me since I was 15.

19:34.250 --> 19:38.041
But you weren't like that,
were you, Ray?

19:45.000 --> 19:47.125
Why are you telling me
about him?

19:47.208 --> 19:49.208
I don't want
to see you get hurt.

19:49.291 --> 19:50.709
Oh, my God! Hurt?

19:50.792 --> 19:52.959
Who is this guy?
I don't know yet.

19:53.041 --> 19:54.375
There are things we can do
to mitigate it.

19:54.458 --> 19:56.083
Mitigate it?

19:56.166 --> 19:57.834
I don't want another dog.

19:57.917 --> 19:59.875
My last dog died of cancer!

20:03.458 --> 20:05.458
I can't handle this right now.

20:06.166 --> 20:09.166
♪ From the same old scam ♪

20:09.250 --> 20:12.417
♪ Feelin' like I'm stuck
in the same old rut ♪

20:12.500 --> 20:15.959
♪ But I keep rollin'
'cause enough is enough ♪

20:16.041 --> 20:19.875
♪ It ain't nothin' to me ♪

20:19.959 --> 20:21.709
♪ I keep on,
just fancy-free... ♪

20:21.792 --> 20:23.542
Party's over, Bunch.
Let's go.

20:23.625 --> 20:27.750
What are you, his mother?
We're fucking conversing here.

20:27.834 --> 20:28.625
I'm not talking to you.

20:28.709 --> 20:30.917
(mocking):
I'm not talking to you.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.291
Man, what the fuck?

20:34.375 --> 20:35.417
What the fuck you...?

20:35.500 --> 20:37.333
(grunting)

20:43.875 --> 20:46.458
How come
we never had a thing?

20:46.542 --> 20:48.500
You're not really my type.

20:52.083 --> 20:53.792
Of course I am.

20:53.875 --> 20:56.500
Yeah?

20:57.834 --> 20:59.417
(sighs)

21:05.417 --> 21:07.792
Let me have
your hand.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.500
What for?

21:09.583 --> 21:11.458
Let me have
your hand.

21:15.417 --> 21:17.000
Your heart line.

21:18.834 --> 21:21.333
My heart line?

21:21.417 --> 21:22.875
You fall in love easily.

21:25.166 --> 21:29.542
All the little lost dolls.

21:32.792 --> 21:35.709
(Ashley moaning)

21:43.125 --> 21:45.250
(both moaning)

21:53.083 --> 21:54.834
Hey.
Hey.

21:54.917 --> 21:57.625
Oh, shit.

22:02.458 --> 22:08.125
Hey, hey, look at me.
Ashley, you okay?

22:10.625 --> 22:12.834
Oh, my God.

22:12.917 --> 22:15.417
I'm so embarrassed.

22:15.500 --> 22:19.667
I have epilepsy and I'm
not supposed to drink.

22:19.750 --> 22:21.959
The sugar fucks me up.

22:22.041 --> 22:24.083
What the fuck am I doing?

22:24.166 --> 22:26.917
Why am I seeing Stu?

22:27.000 --> 22:30.583
He's a terrible person.

22:30.667 --> 22:32.625
God, I'm so fucked up.

22:32.709 --> 22:36.792
It's okay.
You're gonna be all right.

22:39.166 --> 22:42.458
You need to stop opening
your door to strangers.

22:42.542 --> 22:44.250
Get a dog,
not a gun.

22:44.333 --> 22:46.083
You got a gun,
they use it on you.

22:46.166 --> 22:47.750
Get a security system.

22:47.834 --> 22:51.000
Start doing what you need to do
to get your life in order.

22:55.125 --> 22:56.458
(sighs)

22:56.542 --> 22:57.583
(sniffs)

22:57.667 --> 22:58.875
God, (laughs)

22:58.959 --> 23:01.083
I really need yoga right now.

23:01.166 --> 23:03.250
My wife does yoga.

23:03.333 --> 23:04.458
Where?

23:06.208 --> 23:07.500
Uh, Point Dume.

23:12.417 --> 23:12.959
Look, I, um...

23:13.041 --> 23:17.166
I got to go.

23:17.250 --> 23:19.750
(grunts)

23:19.834 --> 23:21.792
Can I see you again?

23:21.875 --> 23:24.667
Let me make sure
you're okay.

23:24.750 --> 23:26.583
Do my job.

23:26.667 --> 23:28.041
With this guy.

23:28.125 --> 23:30.125
Okay.

23:30.208 --> 23:31.667
Thanks, Ray.

23:34.208 --> 23:36.250
I love you.

23:38.625 --> 23:40.000
All right.

23:40.083 --> 23:41.166
Keep your doors locked.

23:41.250 --> 23:43.000
And no more yoga
on the deck.

23:43.083 --> 23:44.834
Yes, Daddy.

23:44.917 --> 23:46.250
Don't worry.

23:46.333 --> 23:47.959
You're in the solution now.

23:48.041 --> 23:50.709
I remember that.

23:50.792 --> 23:52.959
I love it.

23:53.041 --> 23:54.000
What does it mean?

23:54.083 --> 23:55.542
(door slams)

23:58.417 --> 24:00.500
Yeah.

24:02.041 --> 24:04.875
What?

24:06.709 --> 24:09.500
I'm on my way.

24:27.625 --> 24:30.625
How much do we
owe you for bail?

24:30.709 --> 24:32.375
Nothing.

24:34.125 --> 24:35.208
All right, it's not
the end of the world.

24:35.291 --> 24:36.375
I'll get the charges dropped.

24:36.458 --> 24:37.583
Come here.

24:41.250 --> 24:43.500
What are you doing? Come here.

24:46.709 --> 24:50.375
I was sober ten months,
three days until this.

24:50.458 --> 24:50.792
I know, Bunch.

24:52.041 --> 24:54.875
I know.

25:01.667 --> 25:03.667
What's going on?

25:03.750 --> 25:05.041
You remember
Dad's girlfriend Claudette?

25:05.125 --> 25:07.041
Yeah.

25:07.125 --> 25:08.417
They had a kid.

25:08.500 --> 25:09.834
They what?

25:09.917 --> 25:10.792
They had a kid, Ray.

25:13.875 --> 25:14.709
When?

25:14.792 --> 25:15.834
Before he went to Walpole.

25:19.208 --> 25:22.208
How long have you known?

25:22.291 --> 25:23.041
I told you
we should've told him.

25:23.125 --> 25:25.083
How fucking long?

25:25.166 --> 25:26.166
A long time.

25:26.250 --> 25:27.542
He's grown.

25:27.625 --> 25:28.625
His name's Daryll.

25:36.750 --> 25:37.625
Hey, hey,

25:37.709 --> 25:38.667
hey, hey, hey...

25:38.750 --> 25:40.083
Okay, okay.

25:40.166 --> 25:42.667
Hey, Ray.
No.

25:45.041 --> 25:45.792
He doesn't like
strangers touching him.

25:45.875 --> 25:48.000
All right, we can
work up to that.

25:50.709 --> 25:53.667
We didn't think
you could handle it.

26:00.166 --> 26:02.625
Did I say "Come in"?
I didn't say "Come in."

26:02.709 --> 26:04.583
I heard my name so I thought
that meant "Come in."

26:04.667 --> 26:09.166
He and Claudette come out here
about ten years ago.

26:09.250 --> 26:10.709
She got sent away
for writing bad checks.

26:10.792 --> 26:13.458
Ten years you've been
keeping this from me.

26:13.542 --> 26:14.959
A little longer.

26:15.041 --> 26:17.458
Before you moved us out here
and I got the gym.

26:18.625 --> 26:20.083

44:06.917 --> 44:08.750
(laughs)

44:08.834 --> 44:10.458
Oh, man.

44:11.125 --> 44:13.917
Hi.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.875
I'm Abby Donovan.

44:15.959 --> 44:18.875
Hi, Abby Donovan.

44:18.959 --> 44:20.875
Lee said I could talk to you
about Marlborough.

44:20.959 --> 44:22.083
No problem.

44:23.792 --> 44:25.417
Hey, Ray.

44:25.500 --> 44:27.709
What are you doing
here, Tommy?

44:27.792 --> 44:29.750
I got a day pass.

44:29.834 --> 44:31.417
Get out.

44:31.500 --> 44:32.750
Dad, why?

44:32.834 --> 44:34.792
Don't argue with me;
just get out.

44:38.709 --> 44:40.583
ABBY:
That's my daughter, Bridget.

44:40.667 --> 44:42.959
She's a great kid.

44:43.041 --> 44:44.250
Smart as a whip.

44:44.333 --> 44:46.333
STU:
Beautiful girl.

44:46.417 --> 44:48.041
Oh.
Thank you.

44:48.125 --> 44:49.375
What a shame.

44:50.625 --> 44:52.250
Excuse me?

44:52.333 --> 44:55.291
Uh, I'm gonna make sure
that she is banned

44:55.375 --> 44:58.500
from Marlborough,
Harvard-Westlake, all of them.

44:59.709 --> 45:00.959
You know why?

45:01.041 --> 45:03.083
I'll tell you why,
Abby Donovan.

45:03.166 --> 45:05.583
'Cause your husband
fucked my girlfriend.

45:05.667 --> 45:06.959
That's why.

45:09.333 --> 45:11.583
Fuck you.

46:01.041 --> 46:02.625
you never told me
how Bridget died.

46:12.959 --> 46:14.041
(sighs)

46:18.417 --> 46:21.208
She was high on drugs.

46:22.458 --> 46:24.417
She jumped off a roof.

46:27.583 --> 46:28.875
That's really sad.

46:31.542 --> 46:33.291
I'm sorry, Daddy.

46:34.792 --> 46:37.083
It's okay, hon.

46:37.166 --> 46:38.667
(quiet laugh)

46:41.959 --> 46:42.417
Do you miss her?

46:42.500 --> 46:45.542
Yeah, I miss her.

46:45.625 --> 46:48.166
She had a great
sense of humor.

46:48.250 --> 46:49.333
She could make Bunchy
piss his pants.

46:49.417 --> 46:52.250
(giggles)

46:53.458 --> 46:55.333
She sounds
really funny.

47:01.125 --> 47:03.750
Hey.

47:03.834 --> 47:06.709
It's gonna be okay.

47:06.792 --> 47:09.041
It's sad.

47:09.125 --> 47:10.875
I know.

47:10.959 --> 47:12.917
Come here.

47:13.000 --> 47:13.333
(crying)

47:13.417 --> 47:16.125
We're good.

47:16.208 --> 47:18.917
We're really,
really good.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.875
(whispering):
I'll always protect you.

47:28.000 --> 47:31.291
I'm hiring
a realtor.

47:39.667 --> 47:41.917
(sniffs)

47:46.458 --> 47:48.417
That girl.

47:48.500 --> 47:50.417
I knew her
years ago.

47:50.500 --> 47:52.709
Listen, Abs.

47:52.792 --> 47:54.917
Sometimes these women,

47:55.000 --> 47:58.333
I protect them and they get...

47:58.417 --> 48:00.667
You know.

48:00.750 --> 48:02.125
Confused.

48:04.208 --> 48:06.792
She's not
important.

48:06.875 --> 48:08.792
What I'm gonna tell you now
is the important thing.

48:08.875 --> 48:09.625
You got to
listen to me

48:09.709 --> 48:12.583
and you got
to trust me.

48:12.667 --> 48:17.375
My father coming here?

48:17.458 --> 48:20.333
You let him near this family,
everything we worked for,

48:20.417 --> 48:22.291
everything we built--

48:22.375 --> 48:23.500
it'll be over.

48:24.208 --> 48:25.542
Whatever you
think happened,

48:25.625 --> 48:28.375
it was ten times worse.

48:30.417 --> 48:32.041
Don't let the wolf
in the gate, Abby.

48:41.917 --> 48:43.208
Did he reach out to you?

48:45.709 --> 48:47.250
I got to know, Abs.

48:51.750 --> 48:53.834
You're sick, Ray.

48:54.834 --> 48:57.417
You got a hole in your heart.

49:24.458 --> 49:26.250
"If the Man You Love

49:26.333 --> 49:29.542
Was Abused."

49:29.625 --> 49:31.500
You haven't been
on a date in ten years.

49:31.583 --> 49:33.208
You know they got a name for it?

49:33.291 --> 49:34.875
What?

49:34.959 --> 49:38.083
I'm a sexual anorexic.

49:38.166 --> 49:39.291
You're kidding me.

49:39.375 --> 49:40.250
I swear, bro.

49:40.333 --> 49:41.667
How do you like them apples?

49:44.709 --> 49:47.542
Just go easy on him, Ray.

49:47.625 --> 49:50.208
I mean, he wants
to make amends.

49:52.792 --> 49:54.291
He feels real bad
about everything.

50:08.166 --> 50:09.417
You hear about
this new law?

50:09.500 --> 50:12.333
Egan's Law?

50:12.417 --> 50:13.917
They got to notify you if
the Catholic Church moves

50:14.000 --> 50:15.208
into the neighborhood.

50:15.291 --> 50:16.458
(laughs)

50:18.291 --> 50:20.917
Come on, Ray, it's funny.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.917
MICKEY:
If you can't laugh,

50:23.000 --> 50:23.917
what are you gonna
do-- cry all the time?

50:24.000 --> 50:26.083
What are you doing here, Mick?

50:26.166 --> 50:27.583
MICKEY:
What am I doing here?

50:27.667 --> 50:29.166
Last time I saw you,
I was the one going

50:29.250 --> 50:30.875
to Hollywood-- what
the fuck happened?

50:30.959 --> 50:33.083
You set me up,
motherfucker.

50:33.166 --> 50:34.500
20 years.

50:34.583 --> 50:35.583
Now look at you.

50:35.667 --> 50:37.750
Such a big shot.

50:41.500 --> 50:42.583
Well, this is great.

50:42.667 --> 50:43.792
This is great.

50:43.875 --> 50:44.667
All my boys are together.

50:44.750 --> 50:47.166
Everyone's great.

50:47.250 --> 50:49.125
Everyone's great,
Mick?

50:49.208 --> 50:50.500
Really?

50:50.583 --> 50:51.834
Bridget's dead,

50:51.917 --> 50:53.291
Terry's shaking
like a fucking leaf,

50:53.375 --> 50:55.125
and Bunchy can't stay sober
more than a month.

50:55.208 --> 50:56.166
That's your legacy, Mick.

50:57.709 --> 51:00.000
MICKEY:
Hey,

51:00.083 --> 51:03.250
Hollywood big shot.

51:03.333 --> 51:05.625
I want to date Chita Rivera,
Rita Moreno, or Diahann Carroll

51:05.709 --> 51:06.792
if Claudette don't
take me back.

51:06.875 --> 51:09.208
Can you hook me up?

51:14.750 --> 51:16.291
That priest,
I took care of him.

51:16.375 --> 51:19.959
Some very powerful people
are gonna come after me now.

51:20.041 --> 51:21.125
Very powerful.

51:21.208 --> 51:23.583
Da Vinci Code type shit.

51:25.291 --> 51:26.375
(laughing)

51:34.500 --> 51:36.417
You deluded old fuck.

51:36.500 --> 51:39.458
Only guys coming after you
are the guys you ripped off.

51:39.542 --> 51:43.333
Only thing they need is the
address I'm gonna give 'em.

51:43.417 --> 51:45.583
How's those grandkids

51:45.667 --> 51:47.542

Motherfucker!
