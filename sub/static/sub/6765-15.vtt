WEBVTT

00:03.346 --> 00:05.711
Well, the tree at the White
House is a little bigger,

00:05.814 --> 00:07.145
but not much.

00:07.183 --> 00:08.376
Damn.

00:08.417 --> 00:09.713
What's wrong?

00:09.751 --> 00:11.843
l left about
six inches clearance.

00:11.887 --> 00:12.853
l'm losing my touch.

00:12.888 --> 00:13.854
Mmm.

00:13.889 --> 00:14.855
l don't think so.

00:14.890 --> 00:16.049
No, hold it, hold it.

00:16.091 --> 00:18.388
As long as we're getting
in the spirit here...

00:18.426 --> 00:19.949
we might as well
do this right.

00:27.134 --> 00:28.225
Huh.

00:28.269 --> 00:29.701
l see you've done
this before, huh?

00:29.737 --> 00:31.431
This time l mean it.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:42.515 --> 00:43.481
Oh!

00:43.516 --> 00:44.539
This looks like

00:44.584 --> 00:45.743
it's gonna be a
beautiful tree.

00:45.819 --> 00:47.080
Oh. Excuse me.

00:47.120 --> 00:49.087
l didn't mean to... intrude.

00:49.121 --> 00:50.087
Mrs. Martin.

00:50.122 --> 00:51.748
-Thank you, Ray.
-Uh...

00:51.857 --> 00:54.620
l've got a, uh, l've got
a bigger stand out in my truck.

00:54.660 --> 00:55.751
l'm gonna go grab it.

00:55.794 --> 00:56.987
l'll be right back.

01:02.733 --> 01:04.221
So...

01:04.268 --> 01:06.326
You really like this boy.

01:06.370 --> 01:11.033
Mom, if Ray asked me
to marry him right now,

01:11.075 --> 01:12.439
l'd say yes.

01:14.644 --> 01:16.736
l'm gonna go see
if he needs some help.

01:21.284 --> 01:22.716
Well, you heard her.

01:22.752 --> 01:25.914
A son-in-law who works
in a Christmas tree lot.

01:25.956 --> 01:27.115
How charming.

01:27.157 --> 01:28.919
Now, he's more
diverse than that.

01:28.958 --> 01:30.390
He has a pumpkin patch.

01:30.426 --> 01:32.325
l don't find this amusing.

01:32.361 --> 01:33.987
l'd really like to avoid

01:34.029 --> 01:35.052
having our daughter
do something

01:35.097 --> 01:36.927
that we both know
she'll regret.

01:36.966 --> 01:39.058
Felice, leave it alone.

01:39.101 --> 01:40.533
You're only gonna push
them closer together

01:40.568 --> 01:42.125
if you try to do anything.

01:42.170 --> 01:45.263
l'm sorry, but l'm not about
to attend a prenuptial dinner

01:45.306 --> 01:47.432
in a trailer park.

02:52.602 --> 02:55.934
Would someone please tell me
where my damn passport went to?

02:55.972 --> 02:57.404
lt was right here
with the tickets.

02:57.440 --> 02:58.406
Dad, relax.

02:58.441 --> 03:00.135
l got it right here.
Whoa, nice picture.

03:00.175 --> 03:01.163
You look like a terrorist.

03:01.209 --> 03:02.197
l don't think
they're gonna

03:02.244 --> 03:03.642
-let you on the plane.
-Gimme that.

03:03.679 --> 03:05.145
l think l've got everything.

03:05.180 --> 03:06.669
You guys don't believe in
traveling lightly, do you?

03:06.782 --> 03:08.146
You never know
what the weather's

03:08.183 --> 03:09.308
gonna be like in London.

03:09.351 --> 03:10.317
Sure you do. Cold,

03:10.352 --> 03:12.911
wet, foggy, dank, dark, dismal.

03:12.954 --> 03:15.353
That's just fine.
lt'll add to the ambience.

03:15.389 --> 03:18.482
A Dickensian Christmas in London
with my thespian daughter.

03:18.526 --> 03:20.550
Unfortunately with Brenda, you
never know if it's gonna be

03:20.594 --> 03:22.686
the best of times
or the worst of times.

03:22.730 --> 03:23.696
Just kidding, Mom.

03:23.731 --> 03:25.322
Just water the plants,
would you?

03:25.365 --> 03:27.855
Oh, and go to church
on Christmas Eve.

03:27.901 --> 03:29.367
l'll make sure he goes.

03:29.402 --> 03:31.028
Well, at least

03:31.071 --> 03:33.368
we know someone that's gonna
have a white Christmas.

03:33.406 --> 03:35.032
Oh, that's for sure.

03:35.075 --> 03:37.508
l'm sure your friends'll
be very happy to see you.

03:37.544 --> 03:39.568
Well, they'll have
to dig their way out.

03:39.611 --> 03:41.908
lt's a balmy ten below
in Buffalo,

03:41.947 --> 03:43.379
and guess what
the forecast says now?

03:43.415 --> 03:44.381
-More snow.
-More snow.

03:44.416 --> 03:45.382
Yeah.

03:45.417 --> 03:46.542
-Every year.
-Hey, let's go upstairs

03:46.585 --> 03:48.711
and make sure we haven't
forgotten anything.

03:48.754 --> 03:51.381
l've already packed everything
that isn't bolted down.

03:51.422 --> 03:52.752
Jim, come on.

03:58.096 --> 04:01.064
You know, you can still go
with them if you want.

04:01.099 --> 04:03.862
lt's not gonna be very much
fun staying here with me.

04:03.900 --> 04:05.264
No.

04:05.302 --> 04:06.859
l told you already, kiddo,

04:06.903 --> 04:08.893
it's just gonna be you and me.

04:08.939 --> 04:10.872
l won't be angry.

04:10.907 --> 04:13.773
l mean, if l could go
somewhere right now, l would.

04:13.810 --> 04:15.333
Would you stop already?

04:15.379 --> 04:17.676
No such luck,
l'm not going anywhere.

04:17.713 --> 04:20.680
Unless, of course, you don't
get off my back about going.

04:20.716 --> 04:23.047
Okay, l won't
say another word.

04:36.865 --> 04:38.695
You've been doing this
since you were how old?

04:38.733 --> 04:41.292
l was ten or 1 1 . So what?

04:41.336 --> 04:42.302
Actually, after
Hannah's turn

04:42.337 --> 04:43.701
l might ask Santa
for an A

04:43.771 --> 04:45.328
on my Legal
Ethics midterm. Huh?

04:45.372 --> 04:47.703
Don't knock it. lt works.

04:47.741 --> 04:49.367
lf you say so.

04:49.410 --> 04:50.706
Well, do you think
Hannah's ready

04:50.744 --> 04:51.937
for this? l
mean, he's so...

04:51.979 --> 04:53.912
big and red...

04:53.947 --> 04:54.913
Andrea, would you stop?

04:54.948 --> 04:56.039
Look, it's a tradition.

04:56.082 --> 04:58.242
You can't have
a family album

04:58.284 --> 04:59.910
without a picture on
Santa's lap, huh?

04:59.952 --> 05:01.111
Yeah!

05:01.154 --> 05:02.848
Yeah, l'm gonna take a
picture. Okay, honey?

05:02.889 --> 05:04.515
She's gonna enjoy this,
aren't you sweetie?

05:04.557 --> 05:06.217
Yeah...

05:06.893 --> 05:07.859
Hello, there, Santa.

05:07.894 --> 05:09.292
This is my daughter, Hannah.

05:09.327 --> 05:12.853
My, what a beautiful little
child you have here.

05:12.898 --> 05:13.864
Ho, ho, ho.

05:13.899 --> 05:14.990
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

05:17.302 --> 05:21.101
Aw... lt's okay, Santa's
a nice man. Smile.

05:21.139 --> 05:23.368
Oh, Hannah, it's okay.

05:23.407 --> 05:24.498
Smile for Mama.

05:24.542 --> 05:25.530
Come on, smile.

05:28.446 --> 05:29.537
lt's o... honey, don't worry.

05:29.580 --> 05:31.240
lt's o... Honey.

05:34.919 --> 05:36.442
lt's okay.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.582
Do you know what it is
about turkeys at Christmas?

05:44.627 --> 05:46.025
At least they get to feel good

05:46.062 --> 05:47.688
about having some
purpose to their lives.

05:48.730 --> 05:49.991
Dude, will you lighten up?

05:50.032 --> 05:51.259
No, l mean it.

05:51.300 --> 05:53.028
lt's like the Steve
Sanders holiday curse.

05:53.068 --> 05:55.695
l should just erase Christmas
from my calendar completely.

05:55.737 --> 05:56.930
Come on, it can't be that bad.

05:56.972 --> 05:57.938
Oh, yeah?

05:57.973 --> 06:00.031
One year l ran away
to New Mexico

06:00.075 --> 06:01.234
to find my birth mother.

06:01.275 --> 06:02.764
lt turns out she's dead.

06:02.810 --> 06:04.640
The next year l nearly
got expelled from school,

06:04.679 --> 06:05.838
because l tried
to change my grades.

06:05.880 --> 06:07.642
Then last year
l got busted

06:07.682 --> 06:08.648
breaking into a
professor's office,

06:08.716 --> 06:09.647
but this year,

06:09.750 --> 06:11.114
this year, l thought
l was finally

06:11.152 --> 06:12.311
gonna get rid of that curse

06:12.353 --> 06:13.979
with that Peach Pit
After Dark thing.

06:14.021 --> 06:15.146
What happens?

06:15.188 --> 06:16.984
My father sells me out.

06:17.023 --> 06:19.855
Well, Veteran's Day
is a holiday

06:19.893 --> 06:21.120
a lot of people enjoy.

06:22.362 --> 06:23.589
Thanks. Great.
Now l'm stuck

06:23.630 --> 06:24.994
with a bunch of old people

06:25.031 --> 06:27.396
doing community service
at an old folks' home.

06:27.433 --> 06:29.263
-Ah, you'll live. -Well, that's
easy for you to say.

06:29.301 --> 06:30.665
You're not gonna
be calling bingo numbers

06:30.736 --> 06:31.963
for the next hundred years.

06:32.004 --> 06:33.903
Quit complaining. When you
see some of the people

06:33.939 --> 06:35.667
who come in here that
we're gonna feed tomorrow,

06:35.774 --> 06:37.673
you'll change your
tune. Come on.

06:37.743 --> 06:38.868
Grab the bird.
Let's go.

06:38.911 --> 06:40.707
Ah, whatever.

06:42.580 --> 06:45.013
David, l was just thinking...

06:45.049 --> 06:47.676
We know as many people
as Steve does, don't we?

06:47.719 --> 06:49.015
Yeah, l guess so.

06:49.053 --> 06:51.612
And it's no big deal
to hire a DJ, right?

06:51.656 --> 06:52.622
Clare,

06:52.657 --> 06:54.886
don't even think
about us running...

06:54.925 --> 06:58.018
Why? Why can't we keep the
Peach Pit After Dark going?

06:58.061 --> 07:00.221
l mean, do we
really need Steve?

07:00.264 --> 07:02.288
Clare, that's
not the point.

07:02.332 --> 07:04.629
Where's your
entrepreneurial spirit?

07:04.668 --> 07:06.635
Rush Sanders didn't pull
his money out of this.

07:06.669 --> 07:08.727
All they need is someone
to run the place.

07:08.771 --> 07:10.635
Oh, gee, no problem.

07:10.673 --> 07:11.900
David, think
about it.

07:11.941 --> 07:13.635
lf Steve's dad
thought this idea

07:13.676 --> 07:15.836
was worth investing in,

07:15.878 --> 07:18.311
l'm sure there's a way
we can make it work.

07:19.681 --> 07:21.511
Yeah, l guess
it's worth a shot.

07:21.550 --> 07:23.483
Now all you need
to do is convince Nat.

07:23.518 --> 07:25.212
You will.

07:27.355 --> 07:28.321
l will?

07:28.356 --> 07:29.754
Mm-hmm.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.650
l'm off to bed, you guys.

07:33.694 --> 07:35.354
Gotta get up
early in the morning.

07:35.396 --> 07:36.987
Good night. See you
in the morning, Mom.

07:37.031 --> 07:38.327
Good night.

07:38.365 --> 07:42.858
Oh, couldn't you just
stare at the tree forever?

07:42.903 --> 07:46.633
Yeah, the tree's nice,
but if l had my choice,

07:46.673 --> 07:48.902
l'd rather stare at you.

07:50.343 --> 07:51.866
Oh...

07:51.911 --> 07:53.537
Sorry.

07:53.580 --> 07:54.739
lt's okay.

07:56.249 --> 07:59.342
lsn't it getting to be time
to change that dressing?

07:59.384 --> 08:00.611
l can do it for you.

08:01.720 --> 08:02.947
You know what?
l think l'll

08:02.988 --> 08:05.751
just go home and
let my mom do it.

08:05.791 --> 08:08.884
Why won't you let me help you?

08:10.662 --> 08:13.494
l'd just rather
my mom did it.

08:13.531 --> 08:15.088
She knows how and...

08:15.132 --> 08:16.758
And what?

08:19.670 --> 08:21.864
l just don't want you
to see me like this.

08:21.906 --> 08:25.841
Kelly... it's me.

08:25.875 --> 08:27.171
You don't have to be perfect.

08:27.210 --> 08:28.608
That's not why l love you.

08:29.813 --> 08:31.439
l can handle it, okay?

08:31.481 --> 08:34.847
So, you just show me
what to do, and...

08:34.884 --> 08:36.748
we'll take it nice and easy.

08:39.154 --> 08:40.245
l can't.

08:40.289 --> 08:41.515
l'll just see you tomorrow

08:41.557 --> 08:42.648
at the Peach Pit, okay?

08:42.691 --> 08:44.214
Kelly, what's goin' on?

08:46.362 --> 08:48.022
l'll see you later.

08:59.741 --> 09:02.937
David, you're
getting it everywhere!

09:02.977 --> 09:04.944
Well, isn't that part
of the tradition?

09:04.978 --> 09:06.808
No, the tradition
is to wear it.

09:09.316 --> 09:10.805
That's very funny. Oh!

09:10.851 --> 09:12.545
Ohh...

09:12.586 --> 09:13.950
Yeah, okay!

09:13.987 --> 09:15.613
l'm sorry, did l
get some on you?

09:15.656 --> 09:17.589
Whoa!

09:17.623 --> 09:18.884
Well, l better
get going.

09:18.924 --> 09:20.618
l'm taking Ray's mom
Christmas shopping.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.957
Mmm. Have fun.

09:22.995 --> 09:24.962
l don't know.

09:24.997 --> 09:27.829
You know...

09:27.867 --> 09:30.960
Ray said that his, his
mom has a rough time

09:31.002 --> 09:32.263
around this time of year.

09:32.304 --> 09:34.965
You know, super-emotional.

09:35.006 --> 09:36.063
Drinking.

09:36.107 --> 09:37.971
And the closer it
gets to Christmas,

09:38.009 --> 09:39.737
l just...

09:39.778 --> 09:41.802
l don't know. l don't
want it to get weird.

09:41.846 --> 09:44.643
l'm sure she'll stay sober
for the couple of hours

09:44.682 --> 09:46.512
you guys are
together, right?

09:46.550 --> 09:47.982
l don't know.

09:48.018 --> 09:51.851
That's not even what's
bothering me. lt's...

09:51.889 --> 09:54.618
l've met his mom, and
the rest of his family.

09:54.658 --> 09:55.885
-Okay. So?
-Clare, we're not

09:55.925 --> 09:56.982
just from
different worlds,

09:57.026 --> 09:58.515
we're from
different galaxies.

09:58.561 --> 10:00.084
Donna, that
doesn't matter.

10:00.129 --> 10:03.359
Okay? What matters is what
you have with Ray, right?

10:05.368 --> 10:07.665
Yeah, you're right.

10:07.704 --> 10:10.069
l guess l just needed to
hear that from someone.

10:10.105 --> 10:11.196
Okay.

10:11.239 --> 10:12.296
Thanks.

10:12.341 --> 10:14.240
Good-bye, David.

10:15.377 --> 10:16.343
Bye.

10:16.378 --> 10:17.674
Bye.

10:32.059 --> 10:33.525
Daddy! Hi.

10:33.561 --> 10:34.686
What a surprise.

10:34.729 --> 10:36.423
Well, now that you
have your own tree,

10:36.463 --> 10:39.158
l thought you should have
this before Christmas.

10:39.199 --> 10:41.462
Oh, all my ornaments?
Thank you!

10:41.501 --> 10:43.127
lt wouldn't be
Christmas without them.

10:43.169 --> 10:44.362
Thanks, Dad.

10:44.404 --> 10:46.701
Uh, this is,
um, my friend.

10:46.740 --> 10:48.969
David Silver.
This is my dad.

10:49.007 --> 10:50.030
David.
Hi.

10:50.075 --> 10:52.065
Nice to meet you,
Chancellor Arnold.

10:52.111 --> 10:53.372
Now, Clare, please remember,

10:53.412 --> 10:55.470
l'm expecting you
at the faculty Christmas party.

10:55.514 --> 10:58.038
Naturally, l hope you'll
bring Brandon along,

10:58.083 --> 10:59.174
but please make sure

10:59.218 --> 11:01.515
that you invite Kelly
and Donna, okay?

11:01.552 --> 11:02.609
Yeah. Absolutely.

11:02.653 --> 11:04.051
We wouldn't miss
it for the world.

11:04.088 --> 11:05.054
Good, good.

11:05.089 --> 11:06.646
-Okay, l'm off.
-Okay.

11:06.691 --> 11:07.657
Busy day.

11:07.692 --> 11:08.658
-Good-bye, darling.
-Thanks.

11:08.693 --> 11:10.660
Uh... David.

11:10.728 --> 11:11.989
A pleasure.

11:12.029 --> 11:13.290
Bye, Dad.

11:13.331 --> 11:14.592
Thanks.

11:15.632 --> 11:17.758
Well, here we go again.

11:17.801 --> 11:20.564
Why didn't you tell
your dad about us?

11:20.604 --> 11:23.629
Because he was preoccupied.

11:23.673 --> 11:26.664
l want to tell him when he can
really listen to me, you know?

11:26.710 --> 11:29.109
Are you ashamed of me?

11:29.145 --> 11:32.545
David, l promise.

11:32.581 --> 11:34.605
The next time
l see my father,

11:34.650 --> 11:36.207
l'll tell him, okay?

11:36.252 --> 11:39.277
l promise.

11:44.192 --> 11:46.523
You want to see
my ornaments?

11:46.561 --> 11:48.187
Sure.

11:49.431 --> 11:51.864
Well, l guess
l asked the right person

11:51.900 --> 11:53.628
to come shopping with me.

11:53.667 --> 11:55.691
Well, l've had a
little bit of experience.

11:55.736 --> 11:57.396
Okay. Well, then,
help me figure out

11:57.438 --> 11:59.302
something else
to get for Ray.

11:59.339 --> 12:00.669
l already
got him ''The Club''.

12:00.707 --> 12:02.799
l know he's going to
love that for his truck.

12:02.843 --> 12:04.833
Most definitely. Yeah.

12:04.878 --> 12:06.105
But don't you think

12:06.145 --> 12:08.078
he would look great
in one of those suits?

12:08.114 --> 12:11.810
You might have a problem there,
sweetheart.

12:11.851 --> 12:14.114
But he's changing.

12:14.153 --> 12:16.552
Maybe he might
like something like that.

12:16.589 --> 12:18.920
Not that l could afford it,
mind you.

12:18.958 --> 12:22.256
Well, come on.
We can... we can think about it.

12:27.466 --> 12:31.834
Oh, now there's
my idea of heaven.

12:33.304 --> 12:36.670
Hop on the Love Boat
and go 'round the world.

12:36.774 --> 12:38.536
Sitting eating my shrimp

12:38.576 --> 12:40.065
with a glass of champagne
every night.

12:41.445 --> 12:45.574
Well, a girl
can dream, can't she?

12:45.615 --> 12:48.082
Well, maybe if you go
sit on Santa's knee

12:48.117 --> 12:50.084
and tell him, he'll
make it come true.

12:50.119 --> 12:52.552
Honey, l got a better chance
of winning the lottery.

12:52.589 --> 12:54.522
Oh, don't get me wrong.

12:54.557 --> 12:55.887
When Santa brings me

12:55.925 --> 12:59.382
my bottle of eau de cologne
every year, l thank him.

12:59.428 --> 13:01.395
You take what you can get.

13:01.430 --> 13:03.329
That's the way it is.

13:11.439 --> 13:13.429
All right. Thanks a lot.

13:13.474 --> 13:15.941
You have a Merry Christmas,
okay?

13:21.349 --> 13:23.077
Ray.

13:23.117 --> 13:24.083
Mrs. Martin.

13:24.118 --> 13:25.550
Something wrong
with the tree?

13:25.585 --> 13:27.245
Oh, no, no. Not at all.

13:27.287 --> 13:30.653
l just, uh... thought
we might have a little chat.

13:30.690 --> 13:32.179
Sure. What's up?

13:34.661 --> 13:36.321
What would you like
for Christmas, Ray?

13:36.363 --> 13:39.092
l should say,
if you could have anything,

13:39.131 --> 13:40.620
anything you ever dreamed of
for Christmas,

13:40.666 --> 13:42.030
what would that be?

13:42.067 --> 13:45.331
You're an interesting woman.
You know that, Mrs. Martin?

13:45.371 --> 13:48.066
Well, l'm very serious.
Please tell me.

13:48.107 --> 13:49.801
Anything, huh?
Okay. Uh...

13:49.842 --> 13:53.072
l'd love to make
my own album.

13:53.111 --> 13:56.238
That's an expensive dream.

13:56.281 --> 13:58.248
That's why they're
called dreams.

13:58.283 --> 14:03.242
What would you say if l told you
l could make that happen?

14:03.288 --> 14:07.087
l don't believe this.
Are you trying to, uh...?

14:09.059 --> 14:10.650
You are, aren't you?

14:15.432 --> 14:18.594
l think that should make you
very happy this Christmas.

14:18.634 --> 14:20.328
Don't you?

14:43.424 --> 14:45.015
All right. You're all set.

14:45.059 --> 14:47.026
Hi, hon.

14:47.061 --> 14:48.254
Hey.

14:48.295 --> 14:50.285
Something wrong?

14:50.331 --> 14:52.389
You look like you've seen
the Ghost of Christmas.

14:52.433 --> 14:54.900
Nah. l'm all right.

14:54.935 --> 14:56.834
lt's just been busy.

14:56.869 --> 14:58.335
Aren't you supposed
to be helping Donna

14:58.371 --> 15:00.201
serve Christmas dinner
to the homeless?

15:00.239 --> 15:02.468
Like l said, we had a rush.

15:02.508 --> 15:04.407
Ray, l've seen you
drop everything

15:04.444 --> 15:06.274
when it comes
to being with Donna.

15:06.312 --> 15:08.279
Are you going
to tell me what's wrong?

15:08.314 --> 15:10.508
Nothing.

15:10.549 --> 15:14.279
Look, uh, this lady called, l
got a flock of six-footers, so

15:14.319 --> 15:15.751
l better
get on it.

15:15.787 --> 15:17.447
You do that.

15:17.489 --> 15:20.082
But just you make sure
you bring that sweet girl over

15:20.125 --> 15:22.115
to the house tomorrow
for Christmas dinner.

15:22.159 --> 15:24.888
Bet she's never tasted anything
like my Charlotte Russe.

15:24.929 --> 15:27.453
Done deal, Mom.

15:37.607 --> 15:39.267
FBl.

15:39.309 --> 15:42.641
Yes. l'll transfer you.

15:42.712 --> 15:44.645
Yes?

15:44.681 --> 15:46.978
Hi. l'd like to see
Christine Pettit, please.

15:47.017 --> 15:49.541
l'm afraid there's no one here
at the Bureau by that name.

15:49.585 --> 15:51.415
Come on, we don't
gotta play that game.

15:51.453 --> 15:52.419
l know she's here.

15:52.454 --> 15:53.420
l'm sorry, sir.

15:53.455 --> 15:55.479
There's no one here
by that name.

15:55.524 --> 15:58.583
Fine. So why don't you let me
speak to someone

15:58.627 --> 16:00.253
who is in charge, then?

16:00.295 --> 16:01.659
l'm afraid that's
impossible.

16:01.696 --> 16:03.128
He's extremely busy,

16:03.164 --> 16:04.755
and he doesn't see anyone
without an appointment.

16:04.799 --> 16:06.527
lt's Bureau policy.

16:06.567 --> 16:08.898
Bureau policy?
Okay, listen.

16:08.936 --> 16:11.199
You tell the J. Edgar Hoover
boys back there,

16:11.239 --> 16:12.796
take the party dresses off.

16:12.840 --> 16:15.171
My name is Dylan McKay.
l'd like to see somebody.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.606
lf that doesn't ring any bells,

16:16.643 --> 16:19.372
you tell them
l'm Jack McKay's son.

16:20.414 --> 16:21.380
Excuse me, sir.

16:21.415 --> 16:23.348
There's a gentleman
out here to see you.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.441
His name is Dylan McKay.

16:27.386 --> 16:30.354
Yes, sir. Right away.

16:30.389 --> 16:33.915
Mr. McKay, Special Agent
Cobb will see you now.

16:33.959 --> 16:36.392
Through the double
doors, room 1 1 1 ,

16:36.429 --> 16:37.395
down the hall.

16:39.331 --> 16:41.798
FBl.

16:41.833 --> 16:44.562
He's not in
right now.

16:44.602 --> 16:45.727
Yes, after lunch.

16:45.770 --> 16:46.736
Thank you.

16:46.771 --> 16:49.637
Christine Pettit?

16:49.708 --> 16:54.872
Nope. Only Pettit l knew
played for the St. Louis Hawks,

16:54.912 --> 16:57.539
and l'm pretty sure
that was way before your time.

16:57.581 --> 16:58.547
Stop it,
all right?!

16:58.582 --> 16:59.775
Don't get cute
with me, man.

16:59.817 --> 17:01.943
l don't got time for it.
So you put me

17:01.985 --> 17:03.246
in touch with Agent Pettit

17:03.287 --> 17:05.720
or l will get on the phone
to the Los Angeles Times

17:05.756 --> 17:07.950
and l'll tell them all about
the Jack McKay operation,

17:07.990 --> 17:10.150
how you blew it,
and how my dad got killed.

17:10.193 --> 17:11.181
You got it?

17:17.567 --> 17:19.032
Hello, Dylan.

17:19.067 --> 17:20.896
Christine.

17:31.513 --> 17:35.039
l'm sorry about the
security tangle.

17:35.082 --> 17:36.912
lt's just that we've
got to be careful.

17:40.321 --> 17:42.220
You want to
talk about Jack?

17:42.256 --> 17:45.554
No.

17:45.592 --> 17:47.889
But l do need your help.

18:01.373 --> 18:03.203
Do l have a way
with kids or what?

18:04.777 --> 18:05.743
Can l hire you?

18:05.778 --> 18:06.869
l'm not cheap.

18:06.912 --> 18:08.879
l'm effective,
but l'm not cheap.

18:08.914 --> 18:11.245
Mm, how's my little
Christmas girl doing?

18:11.282 --> 18:15.718
Oh, for Jesse's sake, l wish
she was a Christmas girl.

18:15.753 --> 18:17.447
You want to tell
Uncle Steve about it?

18:17.488 --> 18:19.819
l just don't know how to mix
Jesse's family traditions

18:19.857 --> 18:20.823
with my own.

18:20.858 --> 18:23.189
l don't want
to confuse Hannah.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.921
l mean, the voice in my head
keeps saying,

18:24.961 --> 18:27.554
''Andrea, you're Jewish,
you can't do this,''

18:27.597 --> 18:30.030
but she deserves the best
of both traditions.

18:30.066 --> 18:31.896
lt sounds
like she's getting that.

18:31.935 --> 18:32.923
l don't know.

18:32.969 --> 18:34.230
Tonight is going
to be a total disaster.

18:34.271 --> 18:35.294
Jesse wants to go
to Midnight Mass.

18:35.338 --> 18:36.770
Hannah's teething;

18:36.807 --> 18:39.036
there is no way she's going
to make it through the service.

18:39.074 --> 18:41.940
Oh, l don't know.

18:41.977 --> 18:44.308
Oh, honey,
l just want to make this

18:44.346 --> 18:46.438
a special Christmas
for them.

18:46.482 --> 18:47.948
That's all.

18:47.983 --> 18:49.040
Sanders!

18:49.084 --> 18:51.517
We need another turkey
from the kitchen pronto.

18:53.221 --> 18:54.812
Hang tough, Andrea, and
keep the faith, okay?

18:54.856 --> 18:55.981
l'll work on it later.

18:56.024 --> 18:57.320
-Yeah.
-Bye, baby.

18:57.358 --> 18:59.154
Say good-bye.

19:01.129 --> 19:04.894
There you go, one turkey
special with the works.

19:04.932 --> 19:06.228
Young lady.

19:06.266 --> 19:07.493
l don't want this.

19:07.534 --> 19:09.831
l want a mega-burger.

19:09.870 --> 19:12.702
Okay, l'll get you one.

19:12.739 --> 19:14.262
With cheese.

19:14.308 --> 19:15.274
l'll be right back.

19:15.309 --> 19:16.673
Can't say l blame her.

19:16.709 --> 19:17.697
Where's Donna?

19:17.743 --> 19:19.505
l thought her and Ray
were supposed to be here.

19:19.545 --> 19:20.511
Yeah, she called Ray.

19:20.546 --> 19:22.103
He has to stay
at the Christmas tree lot

19:22.148 --> 19:23.671
and she's expected
at her mom's.

19:23.716 --> 19:25.478
Oh, excuses, excuses.

19:26.853 --> 19:30.515
Look, l was talking with Clare
and, um, we were both thinking

19:30.555 --> 19:31.578
that we could
probably keep

19:31.656 --> 19:33.555
the Peach Pit
After Dark going,

19:33.592 --> 19:35.582
well, with your help,
of course.

19:35.627 --> 19:37.355
Uh, what, what do you think?

19:37.395 --> 19:38.418
Well, what l think is

19:38.463 --> 19:40.589
these people need
more gravy,

19:40.632 --> 19:44.089
and we'll talk about it
after the first of the year.

19:44.134 --> 19:45.657
Okay?

19:46.904 --> 19:48.370
Boy, when you see
someone like that,

19:48.405 --> 19:50.634
you thank God
for everything you got.

19:53.911 --> 19:56.606
And wonders...

19:56.713 --> 19:58.236
Here you go.

19:58.281 --> 20:01.579
Of His love...

20:06.923 --> 20:10.517
So presumably they have
contacts down in Brazil

20:10.559 --> 20:11.991
helping them
launder the money.

20:12.027 --> 20:14.620
Or they're having
one hell of a vacation.

20:19.902 --> 20:20.868
Look,

20:20.903 --> 20:22.563
Dylan, l...

20:22.603 --> 20:24.536
l'd like to help you,
but there's a problem.

20:24.572 --> 20:25.765
l don't want to hear that.

20:25.806 --> 20:27.898
The Bureau is
understaffed.

20:27.942 --> 20:29.465
lf l turn your case
over to them,

20:29.510 --> 20:31.739
it'll just end up
in a pile of paperwork.

20:31.779 --> 20:35.236
Then you tell me
what my other options are.

20:35.282 --> 20:39.581
l might have another way
of handling this.

20:39.619 --> 20:41.415
lf you just give me
a little time.

20:41.454 --> 20:42.420
Time.

20:42.455 --> 20:44.319
''Time is money.''

20:44.357 --> 20:46.824
Whoever said it knew
what they were talking about.

20:46.860 --> 20:47.848
Dylan.

20:50.930 --> 20:53.659
You know how l felt
about your father.

20:53.699 --> 20:56.223
l will do

20:56.268 --> 20:59.065
everything l can.

21:03.841 --> 21:06.604
l don't know when she
found time to bake these,

21:06.711 --> 21:10.202
but one Cindy Walsh
pinwheel and you're hooked.

21:12.517 --> 21:14.484
Thanks.

21:15.786 --> 21:18.015
You were fine
when we got to the Peach Pit.

21:18.055 --> 21:19.043
What happened?

21:21.491 --> 21:23.481
All right,
we don't have to talk about it,

21:23.527 --> 21:24.493
but if we don't...

21:24.528 --> 21:25.551
Why were you staring

21:25.595 --> 21:27.289
at that woman in the Peach Pit?

21:27.330 --> 21:30.264
What woman?

21:30.299 --> 21:32.232
lt wasn't just you;
everybody did it.

21:32.268 --> 21:33.393
Everyone just looked at her

21:33.436 --> 21:35.300
like she was something
out of a freak show.

21:35.338 --> 21:38.397
l have no idea
what you're talking about.

21:38.441 --> 21:39.407
The woman

21:39.442 --> 21:41.466
in the corner booth.

21:41.509 --> 21:44.068
Everyone who passed by her
had some morbid fascination

21:44.112 --> 21:45.738
with watching her eat.

21:45.780 --> 21:48.509
Maybe everybody
was just feeling her pain.

21:49.684 --> 21:53.312
Kelly, when l look at you,

21:53.354 --> 21:55.651
l see the most beautiful woman
l know.

21:55.723 --> 21:59.123
l just don't know
if l'm that same person anymore.

22:00.494 --> 22:03.587
All right, come on.

22:03.630 --> 22:05.358
Where are
you going?

22:05.399 --> 22:07.229
You promised my mom
you'd take me to church.

22:07.266 --> 22:09.426
Remember?
Let's go.

22:09.469 --> 22:11.436
l said that to appease her.

22:11.471 --> 22:13.461
l didn't think
that you'd want to go.

22:13.506 --> 22:14.472
Well...

22:14.507 --> 22:16.030
maybe she was right.

22:16.075 --> 22:18.599
lt is Christmas Eve,
after all.

22:18.710 --> 22:20.836
Thank you.

22:29.287 --> 22:31.345
Oh, Mom, l almost forgot--

22:31.390 --> 22:34.051
l want to take some of Lucille's
ambrosia to Ray's tomorrow.

22:34.091 --> 22:35.580
Oh, fine, honey.

22:35.626 --> 22:38.560
l'll make sure she puts it
in some Waterford for you.

22:38.596 --> 22:39.584
Cute, Mom.

22:39.630 --> 22:43.224
Excuse me, l'll
be right down.

22:43.267 --> 22:45.097
l forgot the car keys.

22:59.048 --> 23:02.847
Sweetheart, l didn't want
to ruin our dinner earlier

23:02.885 --> 23:06.877
by bringing this up, but...

23:06.922 --> 23:09.515
there's just something
you've got to know about Ray.

23:09.558 --> 23:12.583
Like what?

23:12.660 --> 23:15.787
l think you've been terribly
misguided by his sensibilities.

23:15.830 --> 23:17.319
Oh, please, Mother.

23:17.365 --> 23:21.027
Donna, how much do you
really know about Ray?

23:21.069 --> 23:24.765
Why are you asking me this?

23:24.805 --> 23:27.068
Well, l guess you could say

23:27.107 --> 23:29.768
l was confirming
an instinct of mine.

23:29.810 --> 23:31.572
So for your sake,

23:31.611 --> 23:34.943
l went to see just how real
his feelings are for you.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.607
What did you do?

23:38.517 --> 23:41.076
As a little test l offered
him a check for $10,000

23:41.120 --> 23:42.313
if he would agree

23:42.354 --> 23:43.752
to stop seeing you.

23:43.789 --> 23:45.983
Oh, my God!

23:46.025 --> 23:48.754
l don't believe this!

23:48.794 --> 23:50.556
How could you even think...?

23:50.595 --> 23:52.824
l think you should be more
concerned about the fact

23:52.864 --> 23:54.330
that he took the money.

23:54.365 --> 23:57.299
No, no, he didn't.

23:57.335 --> 23:59.063
Yes, he did.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.161
Sweetheart, he did.

24:00.205 --> 24:01.762
l know he didn't.

24:01.806 --> 24:04.000
Yes, he did, Donna, he did.

24:04.041 --> 24:05.667
l'm telling you, it
broke my heart

24:05.709 --> 24:08.006
to see how he just
snapped it right up.

24:08.045 --> 24:10.569
And going on about
recording his music

24:10.681 --> 24:13.012
or some such
ridiculous whim.

24:15.652 --> 24:18.279
l love him. l...

24:18.321 --> 24:20.584
Oh, sweetheart, l know you do.

24:20.623 --> 24:22.988
But wouldn't you rather
find out the truth

24:23.025 --> 24:25.288
about Ray now,
then after he left you?

24:25.328 --> 24:28.592
lt's your birthday
tomorrow.

24:28.698 --> 24:32.690
Daddy and l love you so much.

24:32.734 --> 24:34.860
You're the best
Christmas present

24:34.903 --> 24:37.598
we could ever have had.

24:37.639 --> 24:40.368
Honey, don't let this ruin
it for you,

24:40.408 --> 24:42.841
okay?

24:47.548 --> 24:49.344
lt's all right.

24:57.090 --> 24:59.887
l don't want to see him.

24:59.926 --> 25:01.256
Okay, that's fine.

25:01.294 --> 25:03.284
Why, though? What happened?

25:03.329 --> 25:05.319
Nothing.

25:05.365 --> 25:06.991
Come on, Donna,
what's going on?

25:08.567 --> 25:11.034
lt's Ray.

25:11.069 --> 25:12.262
He...

25:12.304 --> 25:14.669
my mom tried...

25:14.706 --> 25:16.070
Forget it.

25:16.108 --> 25:18.473
Donna, you're not
making any sense.

25:18.510 --> 25:20.534
Come on, your mom
tried to do what?

25:20.579 --> 25:21.909
My mom,

25:21.946 --> 25:26.382
she offered Ray $10,000

25:26.417 --> 25:28.611
if he would stop seeing me.

25:30.188 --> 25:31.779
And he took the money?

25:34.125 --> 25:39.084
He's probably laughing all
the way to the bank, huh?

25:39.129 --> 25:42.689
Sure got that Beverly Hills
bitch good.

25:42.732 --> 25:44.722
Then what's he doing here?

25:44.768 --> 25:46.200
Donna, you've gotta
talk to him.

25:47.236 --> 25:48.634
-No.
-Donna?

25:50.005 --> 25:52.199
Get out of here!

25:52.241 --> 25:55.209
Get out.

26:04.319 --> 26:06.343
You gonna let me
say something?

26:07.689 --> 26:08.780
Look, l don't know

26:08.823 --> 26:10.551
what you think happened,
but you're wrong.

26:10.658 --> 26:12.215
l know exactly
what happened.

26:12.260 --> 26:14.284
Yeah, okay, l took the check.

26:14.328 --> 26:16.522
'Cause l knew you
wouldn't believe me

26:16.563 --> 26:19.087
if l just told you what
your mother tried to do.

26:19.132 --> 26:20.996
You'd call me a damn liar.

26:21.034 --> 26:23.160
Go ahead and
think what you want.

26:23.203 --> 26:24.897
But just hear me
out, all right?

26:24.938 --> 26:28.566
l took the money and l kept it.

26:28.608 --> 26:32.566
So that you'd know what your
mother tried to do, all right?

26:32.645 --> 26:34.373
That's the God's honest truth.

26:38.417 --> 26:41.874
When she told me,
l didn't know what to believe.

26:41.920 --> 26:44.410
Look, l want you, Donna.

26:44.456 --> 26:46.980
And l don't give a damn
about your mother's money.

26:48.827 --> 26:51.056
l love you.

26:51.096 --> 26:53.063
l love you, too.

26:54.431 --> 26:55.863
l love you.

26:59.436 --> 27:02.131
Sleep in heavenly peace--

27:02.172 --> 27:04.537
that's pretty good advice, huh?

27:04.608 --> 27:06.268
Very good.

27:06.309 --> 27:08.367
l'm glad we went to church.

27:08.411 --> 27:09.434
Yeah, me, too.

27:09.479 --> 27:10.536
You know, it's funny.

27:10.613 --> 27:13.308
Every year my first
impulse is to avoid going,

27:13.349 --> 27:16.545
but then you go there and you
let it all sink in, you end up

27:16.619 --> 27:18.848
feeling that everything is right
with the world.

27:18.887 --> 27:22.185
Sounds like you had
a religious experience.

27:22.224 --> 27:24.487
Mm-hmm. l think l'm ready
for another experience.

27:24.526 --> 27:25.583
Ohh...

27:28.130 --> 27:30.063
l missed you last night.

27:30.098 --> 27:31.223
l missed you, too.

27:31.266 --> 27:33.563
l fell asleep listening
to Chris Berman say

27:33.668 --> 27:35.567
''He-could-go-all-the way!''

27:37.104 --> 27:39.469
Well, with any luck, he could.

27:39.507 --> 27:40.837
l'm ready.

27:40.875 --> 27:44.401
l swear that isn't one of the
things l prayed for in church.

27:45.712 --> 27:47.576
Yeah, right. l'm
just gonna go upstairs

27:47.681 --> 27:50.581
and change my bandages.

27:50.684 --> 27:53.413
Can l help you?

27:53.453 --> 27:56.285
No, l can do it myself.

27:56.323 --> 27:57.584
l'll meet you in bed.

27:57.656 --> 27:59.316
Okay.

28:01.527 --> 28:03.756
Come on, don't tell me
you called

28:03.796 --> 28:05.956
just to wish me
a Merry Christmas.

28:05.998 --> 28:07.965
That's exactly why l called.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.832
Whoa, lris McKay in
the Christmas spirit.

28:10.868 --> 28:12.425
Let me guess, your guru told you

28:12.470 --> 28:13.936
that your karma
needed some tweaking.

28:15.406 --> 28:17.373
My karma's fine.

28:17.408 --> 28:18.772
lt's my son l worry about.

28:18.810 --> 28:20.970
Yeah, well...

28:21.012 --> 28:22.911
What can l tell you?

28:22.947 --> 28:25.938
l'm here, with my
nonalcoholic eggnog

28:25.982 --> 28:28.449
just ringing in the yuletide.

28:28.485 --> 28:30.315
lt's no picnic, lris.

28:30.354 --> 28:36.189
No, well, you're still battling
your old spirit.

28:36.226 --> 28:37.419
lt takes a while.

28:37.460 --> 28:39.723
Well, the old spirit's
pretty strong.

28:39.762 --> 28:43.458
Sometimes l wonder if l still
have the strength to fight it.

28:43.499 --> 28:45.363
Dylan, through hard times

28:45.401 --> 28:50.463
the secret is in just accepting
who you are, and where you are.

28:50.505 --> 28:53.268
That's where the freedom
comes from.

28:53.308 --> 28:54.672
lt gets better.

28:54.709 --> 28:56.869
Yeah, something tells me it
wouldn't take much

28:56.911 --> 28:59.504
to convince me that the view's
still better where you are.

28:59.547 --> 29:03.607
Well, then get it together
and come visit.

29:03.650 --> 29:06.777
Yeah, watch out.
l just might do that.

29:06.820 --> 29:10.118
Listen, Mom,
l'm glad you called.

29:10.157 --> 29:11.783
And, if it's not too formal

29:11.825 --> 29:14.122
l would like to take this
opportunity

29:14.161 --> 29:15.889
to wish you and yours
a Merry Christmas.

29:15.928 --> 29:19.294
Right back at you, kiddo.

29:19.332 --> 29:22.027
Make them good holidays.

29:22.068 --> 29:23.534
l love you.

29:23.603 --> 29:25.263
l love you, Mom.

29:41.886 --> 29:43.182
Hey, look out, make way.

29:43.220 --> 29:45.278
Christmas tree express is
coming through,

29:45.322 --> 29:48.256
express train, whoo!

29:48.292 --> 29:49.417
Oh, would you look at

29:49.460 --> 29:50.926
the size of that monster!

29:50.961 --> 29:52.359
ls it big enough for you?

29:52.396 --> 29:53.692
Do you like that?

29:53.731 --> 29:55.527
l'll tell you what, l got
a car full of presents,

29:55.565 --> 29:56.531
l got lights, l got decorations,

29:56.566 --> 29:58.260
l got flashing candy canes!

29:58.301 --> 29:59.733
And for the grand finale

29:59.769 --> 30:01.929
l got three tickets
to Disneyland.

30:05.108 --> 30:06.904
l didn't think l was
ever going to see you again.

30:06.943 --> 30:08.239
Are you kidding?

30:08.277 --> 30:10.073
l never had a sister before.

30:30.331 --> 30:33.891
Hey, hey, what's the matter?

30:36.603 --> 30:39.594
l can't do it by myself.

30:39.673 --> 30:40.934
l need help.

30:40.974 --> 30:42.338
You'll have to help me

30:42.375 --> 30:43.739
take this off.

30:43.777 --> 30:44.743
Yeah.

30:44.778 --> 30:47.041
And this, too.

30:47.079 --> 30:49.012
All right.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.475
lt's still really sensitive.

30:53.519 --> 30:54.542
Okay, hold on.

30:54.587 --> 30:56.247
l don't want this
to hurt you.

30:57.756 --> 31:01.156
Oh, man.

31:01.192 --> 31:04.160
Oh, l'm sorry, Kel,
l had no idea.

31:05.897 --> 31:08.228
lt's grotesque--
you can say it.

31:08.266 --> 31:10.165
No, no, no, that's
not what l meant.

31:13.370 --> 31:16.270
l keep thinking l must have
done something horrible

31:16.306 --> 31:17.829
to deserve this.

31:17.875 --> 31:19.933
You didn't do anything.

31:19.977 --> 31:22.501
Then why did it
happen to me?

31:22.546 --> 31:26.311
Sometimes things happen
for no reason.

31:26.349 --> 31:29.749
You've just gotta believe
that somehow something good's

31:29.785 --> 31:31.274
gonna come out of it.

31:31.320 --> 31:34.254
Do l put the ointment on now?

31:34.290 --> 31:35.449
Yeah.

31:35.491 --> 31:38.982
l think about the fire

31:39.028 --> 31:42.485
and Alison every minute.

31:42.531 --> 31:44.896
l can't make it go away.

31:44.933 --> 31:46.923
And now l have this...

31:46.968 --> 31:50.027
a permanent reminder.

31:50.071 --> 31:52.402
This doesn't change
who you are, Kel.

31:52.439 --> 31:54.201
Not to me.

32:01.215 --> 32:03.478
How's that?

32:03.517 --> 32:05.279
Good.

32:07.754 --> 32:09.914
Thanks for staying.

32:14.527 --> 32:16.323
l love you.

32:17.463 --> 32:20.329
You might not say that
after you get my bill.

32:35.246 --> 32:36.872
Mother...

32:37.982 --> 32:39.676
Ah, there you are.

32:39.717 --> 32:42.583
l've been waiting
for you.

32:42.620 --> 32:44.746
Happy Birthday,
sweetheart.

32:44.788 --> 32:46.948
Merry Christmas.

32:46.990 --> 32:48.547
l'll go get Daddy,

32:48.592 --> 32:50.957
and you can open up some
of your presents, okay?

32:52.228 --> 32:53.819
ls something wrong?

32:53.863 --> 32:56.092
Yeah, very wrong.

32:56.132 --> 32:58.531
Sweetheart, l know
that last night

32:58.567 --> 32:59.760
was very upsetting for you.

32:59.802 --> 33:02.634
But it's your birthday.

33:02.671 --> 33:04.501
Ray gave me the money back.

33:04.540 --> 33:06.973
He told me everything.

33:07.009 --> 33:08.805
l-l don't understand.

33:08.844 --> 33:11.277
Yes, you do.

33:11.312 --> 33:14.542
And since you
were so generous,

33:14.582 --> 33:18.278
l found a way to make someone's
Christmas very happy...

33:18.319 --> 33:19.546
Mom.

33:33.634 --> 33:36.898
Would you care to tell me
what that was all about?

33:49.382 --> 33:51.576
You know, l felt like l
was back in catechism again

33:51.650 --> 33:53.913
the way Sister Mary lgnatius
kept staring at us like that.

33:53.952 --> 33:55.384
Jesse, she kept
spitting out her pacifier.

33:55.420 --> 33:56.408
She wouldn't take the bottle!

33:56.454 --> 33:58.011
What did you
expect me to do?!

33:58.056 --> 33:59.317
You know, you were looking

33:59.357 --> 34:01.256
for an excuse to leave anyway,
weren't you? Yeah!

34:01.292 --> 34:02.758
No, l was not.

34:02.793 --> 34:05.784
But most people don't expect
a teething, six-month-old baby

34:05.829 --> 34:07.728
to behave at Midnight Mass!

34:12.569 --> 34:15.661
Look, l'm sorry about
last night, okay?

34:15.705 --> 34:17.934
Let's just try
to work through it, okay?

34:19.942 --> 34:22.466
Look, it's Christmas.

34:22.512 --> 34:26.174
Don't you want
to open up presents?

34:26.215 --> 34:28.739
Yeah.

34:28.784 --> 34:30.341
Yeah, sure.

34:30.385 --> 34:32.681
That's better.

34:32.721 --> 34:34.152
Come on, Hannah.

34:34.188 --> 34:35.485
Let's see what Santa
brought you.

34:35.524 --> 34:37.114
What did Santa bring you?

34:37.159 --> 34:39.092
Oh, look it! Oh!

34:39.127 --> 34:40.092
Look it!

34:40.128 --> 34:42.152
Look! Jingle bells,
jingle bells

34:43.197 --> 34:45.891
Jingle bells,
jingle all the way

34:45.933 --> 34:47.456
Oh, what fun it...

34:47.501 --> 34:48.933
lt's okay. Oh!

34:50.771 --> 34:51.737
Oh, look,

34:51.772 --> 34:54.706
what did Santa bring you?

34:54.741 --> 34:57.334
lt's a teddy bear Santa!

34:57.377 --> 34:59.901
Look, Hannah,
here's Santa!

34:59.946 --> 35:02.038
Looky! Oh, hello, Hannah.

35:02.082 --> 35:05.209
Oh, honey, it's okay.

35:06.753 --> 35:09.243
l can't take this
anymore!

35:09.288 --> 35:11.517
Jesse...

35:11.557 --> 35:12.989
You know what, you know what?

35:13.025 --> 35:14.514
Why don't we just forget
about Christmas altogether?!

35:14.560 --> 35:15.821
'Cause you know what?

35:15.861 --> 35:17.760
That's exactly what you want.
lsn't it? lsn't it?

35:17.796 --> 35:20.355
Jesse, that is not what l want!

35:22.333 --> 35:24.300
Hold on!

35:24.335 --> 35:26.996
Hey, l'm coming. Hold on!

35:29.507 --> 35:31.371
Merry...

35:38.749 --> 35:39.840
Merry Christmas.

35:39.883 --> 35:41.372
l'm a little tapped out, man.

35:41.418 --> 35:42.884
You'll have to come back
next year.

35:47.890 --> 35:52.087
Hey, did you hear
what l said?

35:52.128 --> 35:54.357
My name is J.J. Jones.

35:54.396 --> 35:56.454
And l'm a friend
of Christine Pettit.

35:56.499 --> 35:57.726
That name ring a bell?

35:57.767 --> 36:00.428
-Yeah, maybe. What can l do
you for? -Well, l think it's

36:00.468 --> 36:02.230
the other way around.
l'm here to help you, pal.

36:02.270 --> 36:03.600
-Me?
-Yeah, you.

36:05.573 --> 36:07.472
Well, come on in, Jonesy.

36:07.509 --> 36:08.770
You're welcome here.

36:09.844 --> 36:11.174
Don't mind if l do.

36:11.212 --> 36:12.940
Good to see you.

36:15.783 --> 36:18.114
Ah, sorry about that.

36:18.152 --> 36:20.517
That's all right.

36:20.587 --> 36:23.020
Donuts...

36:23.056 --> 36:24.522
You think it'd be all right

36:24.591 --> 36:26.990
if l grabbed one
of these little donuts?

36:27.026 --> 36:29.050
'Cause, uh...

36:29.095 --> 36:32.325
l got myself
on this grapefruit, uh...

36:32.365 --> 36:34.889
juice diet and, uh...

36:37.937 --> 36:40.302
l got acids.
They're killing me.

36:40.338 --> 36:41.361
Yeah, before they do,

36:41.406 --> 36:43.168
you wanna tell me
what's going on here?

36:43.208 --> 36:45.198
Well, we haven't gotten there
yet, have we, huh?

36:45.243 --> 36:46.436
Oh, my.

36:46.478 --> 36:47.444
What?

36:47.479 --> 36:48.445
-Parades.
-What?

36:48.480 --> 36:51.004
You like parades?
l love parades.

36:51.049 --> 36:54.449
Here. Well, let me tell
you what the deal is.

36:54.485 --> 36:58.750
l'm sorry
l didn't come in ribbons,

36:58.789 --> 37:00.688
but, uh,

37:00.724 --> 37:04.955
l'm your Christmas present
from Christine.

37:04.994 --> 37:07.587
Well, then l know she read
the wish list wrong, so...

37:07.630 --> 37:09.028
No, no,
l don't think so.

37:09.065 --> 37:11.089
Not after she told me
about your little fiasco,

37:11.134 --> 37:12.100
what happened to you.

37:12.135 --> 37:14.261
Now l want you to
look at me, look at me.

37:14.304 --> 37:17.739
l want you to look at me
as a salvage expert.

37:17.774 --> 37:19.434
Okay, l go after
your dough

37:19.474 --> 37:21.703
and maybe l find it.
lf l do, then l get half.

37:21.743 --> 37:23.232
What? Half?
What, are we married?

37:23.278 --> 37:24.369
Plus expenses.

37:24.413 --> 37:27.313
Now if you're interested,
all l need is a handshake.

37:27.349 --> 37:30.181
Right. Let me get this straight.

37:30.219 --> 37:34.245
Now what you're telling me
is that you...

37:34.288 --> 37:35.254
-Me.
-You?

37:35.289 --> 37:37.153
Come on! come on!
Come on, spit it out!

37:37.191 --> 37:38.953
Look, l could be unwrapping
presents

37:38.993 --> 37:40.459
with my pet snake right now.

37:40.494 --> 37:41.960
Besides,

37:41.996 --> 37:46.455
this eight million dollars
that's, uh, down in Rio,

37:46.499 --> 37:48.523
all of a sudden,
it gets my attention.

37:48.635 --> 37:52.536
And l'm sure you've been
losing a few winks

37:52.606 --> 37:53.833
over it, too, huh?

37:53.874 --> 37:55.864
From now on,

37:55.909 --> 37:58.433
l want you to call me
Jonesy, okay?

37:58.477 --> 37:59.966
ls Jones your real name?

38:00.012 --> 38:04.038
ls Jones anybody's
real name, hmm?

38:05.384 --> 38:08.819
Okay, so, uh, when
do we go, Jones?

38:08.854 --> 38:11.048
l don't think
it's a ''we'' thing, sir.

38:11.089 --> 38:12.077
What?

38:12.123 --> 38:15.285
lt's a me. You stay here,
you stay put right here

38:15.326 --> 38:17.350
and if l find something,
l'll let you know.

38:17.395 --> 38:20.454
ls it a deal,
laddy buck?

38:22.700 --> 38:23.961
Yeah.

38:24.001 --> 38:27.868
Merry Christmas, everyone!
Merry Christmas!

38:27.905 --> 38:31.203
Mm, l wait
all year for this.

38:31.241 --> 38:32.434
Well, it looks incredible.

38:32.476 --> 38:33.601
As my sister Dutch

38:33.644 --> 38:34.905
says, ''The fun starts

38:34.945 --> 38:36.673
when you're lickin'
those ladyfingers.''

38:36.712 --> 38:38.611
Here, dig in.

38:38.648 --> 38:39.807
Hold on a second, Mom.

38:39.849 --> 38:42.874
Luanne, Ray and l have
a present for you.

38:42.919 --> 38:44.681
Having Christmas dinner with you
two is my present.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.084
No, it's just a little
something, Mom.

38:46.122 --> 38:47.110
lt's no big deal.

38:50.358 --> 38:53.121
Ray, l'm gonna be embarrassed

38:53.161 --> 38:55.628
if this is that negligee
l asked you for.

39:02.303 --> 39:03.462
You gotta be kiddin' me!

39:03.537 --> 39:05.026
First-class ticket for

39:05.072 --> 39:06.333
a two-week cruise
in the Caribbean.

39:06.373 --> 39:07.930
You don't have to dream anymore.

39:10.444 --> 39:12.377
My legs are shaking.

39:12.413 --> 39:14.471
lt was all
Donna's idea, Mom.

39:14.548 --> 39:16.777
l told her she could've
just got you a box of candy,

39:16.816 --> 39:19.579
but, uh, there was
no stopping her.

39:19.619 --> 39:22.849
Well, all l can say is

39:22.889 --> 39:24.253
it's a lot better

39:24.290 --> 39:25.950
than a bottle
of eau de cologne.

39:25.992 --> 39:27.686
Come here, you two.

39:27.727 --> 39:32.095
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

39:32.130 --> 39:34.597
Oh, Ray.

39:34.633 --> 39:37.396
This is the first good Christmas

39:37.436 --> 39:39.995
l've had in a very long time.

39:40.038 --> 39:44.098
l still haven't given you
your present yet, Donna.

39:44.141 --> 39:46.165
l've already got it.

39:52.750 --> 39:55.309
Jesse, can l make you
a sandwich or something?

39:55.352 --> 39:56.477
Huh?

39:56.519 --> 39:58.748
Oh no, no, thank you.
l'm not hungry.

39:58.788 --> 40:02.780
Maybe, uh, maybe we'll go
on a walk or something later.

40:02.826 --> 40:03.814
Ho-ho!

40:04.894 --> 40:06.485
Ho-ho-ho!

40:10.099 --> 40:11.360
Ho-ho-ho!

40:17.406 --> 40:18.531
Why are you here, Steve?

40:18.640 --> 40:19.697
Santa Claus...

40:19.742 --> 40:21.106
Steve, man,
thanks, but you know...

40:21.142 --> 40:23.541
No, no, no, l didn't come down
here from the North Pole

40:23.611 --> 40:25.077
to hear that, bucko.

40:25.113 --> 40:27.546
l came down here to make sure
my favorite little girl has

40:27.648 --> 40:28.978
a very special Christmas.

40:29.017 --> 40:30.483
Right, Santa Clones?

40:30.518 --> 40:31.484
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

40:31.519 --> 40:33.509
Ooh, she's eating
Santa's beard.

40:33.553 --> 40:34.541
Watch out...

40:34.588 --> 40:36.555
Look who it is.
The more the merrier.

40:36.590 --> 40:37.556
Merry Christmas.

40:37.591 --> 40:38.989
Merry Christmas.

40:39.026 --> 40:40.458
Merry Christmas.

40:40.494 --> 40:41.892
The elves, we couldn't get

40:41.928 --> 40:44.862
through the cold winters
without them.

40:44.898 --> 40:46.660
Oh, yes, aren't they gorgeous?

40:46.699 --> 40:48.256
Oh, look how
happy she is.

40:48.300 --> 40:49.891
How quiet she is.

40:49.935 --> 40:51.299
l've got the magic touch.

40:51.337 --> 40:54.703
Aw...

40:54.740 --> 40:56.969
Merry Christmas,
everybody!

40:57.009 --> 40:59.374
Feliz Navidad.

41:00.412 --> 41:01.878
Oh, here you go, honey.

41:01.913 --> 41:04.642
Here you go.

41:06.151 --> 41:08.141
Oh, l'll get it, hold it up.

41:13.424 --> 41:15.357
Dylan?

41:15.392 --> 41:20.385
l thought it was about time
l saw that baby of yours.

41:20.431 --> 41:21.920
Come on in.

41:40.649 --> 41:42.878
Just a second.

41:42.918 --> 41:46.375
Poochie-poochie.
