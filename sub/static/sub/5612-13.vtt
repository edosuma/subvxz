WEBVTT

00:00.991 --> 00:02.017
Okey dokey.

00:02.017 --> 00:03.919
The car is picking me and Amy
up in two minutes.

00:03.920 --> 00:05.454
You sure you're cool
keeping tabs on my cases

00:05.455 --> 00:06.655
while I'm on the cruise?

00:06.656 --> 00:08.124
You bet. I hope
you have a great time.

00:08.125 --> 00:10.592
Hey, don't make
any new best friends.

00:12.396 --> 00:14.063
Oh.
Maybe you shouldn't go.

00:14.064 --> 00:15.698
Are you kidding?
I am psyched to go

00:15.699 --> 00:18.300
on this week-long cruise, just
sitting around doing nothing.

00:18.301 --> 00:20.369
Straight up living
that slug life, y'all.

00:20.370 --> 00:22.237
Cruise itineraries,
hot out of the laminator.

00:22.272 --> 00:25.006
Who's ready for some nonstop
totally scheduled fun?

00:25.041 --> 00:28.377
Oh, I actually thought
we could just... sit by the pool,

00:28.378 --> 00:31.067
eat unlimited shrimp, and see
what it does to our bodies.

00:31.081 --> 00:32.481
That's cute.

00:32.482 --> 00:33.783
I don't know if there's
gonna be time, though.

00:33.784 --> 00:35.584
The cruise offers 77 activities,

00:35.585 --> 00:37.853
and I signed us up
for 76 of them.

00:37.854 --> 00:39.921
Speed dating for widows
seemed like a bummer.

00:39.956 --> 00:42.091
Okay, so slightly
different perspectives

00:42.092 --> 00:43.459
going into this cruise.

00:43.460 --> 00:44.660
Call it the slug life talking,

00:44.661 --> 00:45.928
but I think it's gonna
work itself out.

00:45.929 --> 00:46.962
Good-bye, coworkers,

00:46.963 --> 00:48.631
or as they like to say at sea...

A gang of oldies

01:18.628 --> 01:19.929
check, check, check.

01:19.930 --> 01:21.429
We are definitely on a cruise.

01:21.465 --> 01:22.798
Welcome aboard.

01:22.799 --> 01:25.633
Say, "I love Carousel Cruises
International Ltd."

01:25.669 --> 01:27.703
I love Carousel Cruises
International Ltd.

01:27.704 --> 01:29.972
I don't want to say that.

01:29.973 --> 01:31.106
All right.

01:31.107 --> 01:35.144
So... the Sail Away party
is in an hour,

01:35.145 --> 01:37.913
and until then, I have us
scheduled to take in live music

01:37.914 --> 01:39.548
at the all-ages piano lounge.

01:39.549 --> 01:42.284
Okay, okay. Or we could just
head straight to the room.

01:42.285 --> 01:44.587
I brought a plastic tarp
so we can eat shrimp in bed.

01:44.588 --> 01:48.224
But the all-ages piano lounge
has bottomless margaritas.

01:48.225 --> 01:49.357
Eh.

01:49.392 --> 01:51.092
They also have a drink
with a potato skin in it.

01:51.127 --> 01:54.830
Ohh. To the all-ages
piano lounge, merlady.

01:54.831 --> 01:56.731
Mm-hmm.

01:56.766 --> 01:59.802
Welcome aboard,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:59.803 --> 02:01.102
but especially ladies.

02:01.137 --> 02:02.438
I know that voice.

02:02.439 --> 02:04.772
Get ready. It's time
for some smush songs.

02:06.476 --> 02:08.978
Doug Judy.
The Pontiac Bandit.

02:08.979 --> 02:09.979
He's here.

02:09.979 --> 02:11.747
We got songs about smushing,

02:11.748 --> 02:14.149
songs for smushing to,

02:14.150 --> 02:16.185
songs for the kids.

02:16.186 --> 02:18.853
This is the all-ages
piano lounge.

02:18.889 --> 02:20.756
I can't believe he's here.
I've been hunting him for years,

02:20.757 --> 02:22.358
and now fate has dropped him
right into my lap.

02:22.359 --> 02:24.526
He's gonna be so surprised
when he sees me.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.227
Hey, Peralta, you made it.

02:27.330 --> 02:28.697
What took you so long, brother?

02:28.698 --> 02:30.299
Okay, seems like he's
playing it pretty cool.

02:30.300 --> 02:31.800
Probably more surprised
on the inside.

02:31.801 --> 02:32.967
Uh-huh.

02:35.438 --> 02:38.339
Sir, Gina and I are
worried about you.

02:38.375 --> 02:40.309
You're drinking a second can
of seltzer.

02:40.310 --> 02:41.977
I need this to settle my nerves.

02:41.978 --> 02:44.346
Hurricane Debbie is approaching.

02:44.347 --> 02:47.950
My little sister Debbie,
she's a real drama queen.

02:47.951 --> 02:50.452
The drama queen
of the Holt family?

02:50.453 --> 02:52.554
What, did she laugh
out loud one time?

02:52.589 --> 02:54.256
She's laughed out loud
multiple times.

02:54.257 --> 02:57.492
Sir, you have a pretty low bar
for what you consider drama.

02:57.527 --> 03:00.396
Once, I used an exclamation
point in a email.

03:00.397 --> 03:01.997
You called me Diana Ross.

03:01.998 --> 03:05.234
I assure you, in this case,
I do not exaggerate.

03:05.235 --> 03:07.069
Raymond!

03:07.070 --> 03:08.370
Here.

03:08.371 --> 03:09.872
Judge for yourselves.

03:09.873 --> 03:10.872
Here you are.

03:10.874 --> 03:12.141
Great. Oh, my God.

03:12.142 --> 03:14.877
My trip here
from the train station...

03:14.878 --> 03:17.246
hey, I swear to you
I heard the cab driver

03:17.247 --> 03:19.847
mumble under his breath,
"You will die tonight."

03:19.883 --> 03:24.185
Is that not the most insane
thing you have ever heard?

03:24.220 --> 03:27.755
I mean, can you even, Raymond?

03:27.791 --> 03:31.059
I cannot... even.

03:32.195 --> 03:33.462
I hadn't seen her in a while.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.063
She lived alone.

03:35.098 --> 03:36.864
She was 89 years old.

03:36.900 --> 03:38.133
Okay, thanks.

03:38.134 --> 03:40.102
There's no forced entry
or visible trauma.

03:40.103 --> 03:41.603
It's probably natural causes.

03:41.638 --> 03:44.506
- We'll take a look around...
- Sure.

03:44.507 --> 03:46.975
This huge apartment.

03:47.010 --> 03:49.744
What is this, like,
1,800 square feet?

03:49.779 --> 03:51.579
Exposed brick.

03:51.615 --> 03:53.047
Got tons of natural light.

03:53.083 --> 03:55.443
Weird. I thought you'd be most
exciting about the gas range.

03:55.452 --> 03:58.453
They have a gas range.

03:58.488 --> 03:59.955
I have to apply
for this apartment.

03:59.956 --> 04:01.357
I mean, it just
became available.

04:01.358 --> 04:02.824
We're the only two people
to see it.

04:02.859 --> 04:04.760
This is an opportunity
you just don't get

04:04.761 --> 04:06.128
in New York real estate ever.

04:06.129 --> 04:07.895
A woman just died here.

04:07.931 --> 04:09.797
Don't be gross
and disrespectful.

04:12.969 --> 04:15.937
Holy crap, look at all
this closet space.

04:15.972 --> 04:17.272
I'm applying too.

04:17.273 --> 04:19.241
What? You don't need
closet space.

04:19.242 --> 04:21.176
You have, like, one outfit.

04:21.177 --> 04:22.844
- Just let me have this.
- No.

04:22.879 --> 04:24.079
We saw it at the same time.

04:24.080 --> 04:25.947
May the best man win.

04:25.982 --> 04:27.016
Game on.

04:28.351 --> 04:31.420
I mean, the game of
contacting the next of kin.

04:31.421 --> 04:33.488
That's the game I like to play.

04:33.523 --> 04:36.090
Peralta, it's no coincidence
you're on a ship.

04:36.126 --> 04:38.092
You won a free cruise
without entering a contest.

04:38.128 --> 04:39.228
How do you think that happened?

04:39.229 --> 04:40.529
I don't know.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.498
Maybe it's because I bought
"Speed 2" on DVD,

04:42.499 --> 04:43.866
and the Internet
realized that cruises

04:43.867 --> 04:45.033
were one of my interests.

04:45.068 --> 04:46.601
Great film.
Sandy B. in a sarong.

04:46.636 --> 04:47.636
Damn straight.

04:47.637 --> 04:49.003
But the tix are all me.

04:49.039 --> 04:50.371
I brought you here
'cause I'm in peril.

04:50.407 --> 04:52.241
- Pfft. Peril.
- Don't "pfft" my peril.

04:52.242 --> 04:53.542
Pfft.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.176
Somebody's trying to kill me,
and I need protection,

04:55.211 --> 04:56.578
so I sent for my best friend.

04:56.579 --> 04:57.946
I am not your best friend.

04:57.947 --> 04:59.867
I'm your worst enemy.
Get that through your head.

04:59.883 --> 05:01.050
It's this kind of bickering

05:01.051 --> 05:02.350
that makes us
such an adorable couple.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.886
Whatever, Judy.
You're under arrest.

05:04.921 --> 05:07.188
You can't arrest me, boo.
We're in international waters,

05:07.223 --> 05:10.192
which is also why I can smoke
as much weed as I want.

05:10.193 --> 05:12.261
Welcome to the <i> high</i> seas.

05:12.262 --> 05:13.629
No, no way that that's true.

05:13.630 --> 05:15.129
Amy, tell me I can
arrest him right now.

05:15.165 --> 05:16.899
Judy's right.
We have no jurisdiction.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.200
Technically this boat flies
under the flag of Uzbekistan.

05:19.235 --> 05:23.639
Uh-oh. Your girl knows
about the Uzbeks. Oh.

05:23.640 --> 05:25.541
But the captain
can have him arrested.

05:25.542 --> 05:27.075
He has total authority
on this boat.

05:27.110 --> 05:29.578
Perfect.
Captains love me.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.714
Just wait until he or she

05:31.715 --> 05:34.048
finds out they're
employing a criminal.

05:34.084 --> 05:36.384
Yeah, about 40% of the crew
are criminals.

05:37.420 --> 05:38.721
It's hard to find normal people

05:38.722 --> 05:39.754
who want to live on a boat.

05:39.789 --> 05:41.756
I, myself, am a tax evader.

05:41.791 --> 05:43.559
I just need him locked up
till we get back to New York.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.426
Can't you just throw him
in boat jail?

05:45.462 --> 05:46.795
It's called the brig.

05:46.796 --> 05:48.563
He is my best lounge singer,

05:48.598 --> 05:50.532
and I need to keep people
distracted.

05:50.533 --> 05:52.900
Just between us, we're nearly
out of ranch dressing.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.202
On day one?

05:54.237 --> 05:55.504
These people are animals.

05:55.505 --> 05:57.973
Listen, as long
as he's on my boat,

05:57.974 --> 05:59.874
Doug Judy is a free man.

06:04.367 --> 06:06.934
Jake, Amy, welcome to my cabin,

06:06.969 --> 06:10.337
AKA the Boom-Boom Stateroom.

06:12.675 --> 06:15.143
This is a royale level suite.

06:15.144 --> 06:17.111
I never thought
we'd see one in person.

06:17.146 --> 06:18.446
Little perk of being

06:18.447 --> 06:20.280
Carousel Cruises'
entertainer of the year.

06:20.316 --> 06:23.617
♪ Which I am, girrr-rl ♪

06:23.653 --> 06:24.985
A little pitch-y.

06:25.021 --> 06:26.488
You're welcome to chill here.

06:26.489 --> 06:28.022
It's the least I can do
to thank you for protecting me.

06:28.057 --> 06:30.492
Never.
This protection scam is a scam.

06:30.493 --> 06:32.160
Do you honestly think
you can fool me again

06:32.161 --> 06:34.795
just because you've successfully
done it numerous times before?

06:34.830 --> 06:36.930
Look, my old boss wants me dead.

06:36.966 --> 06:38.599
I've been laying low
on this ship,

06:38.634 --> 06:39.968
and I got word from
a friend on the inside

06:39.969 --> 06:41.336
that they found me,
and there's a hitman

06:41.337 --> 06:43.405
coming to end my beautiful life.

06:43.406 --> 06:45.606
That's why I sent you
the free tickets.

06:45.641 --> 06:48.443
No! No, no way.
I'm not buying it.

06:48.444 --> 06:49.844
You can't get away
from me again.

06:49.845 --> 06:52.347
Amy and I are gonna spend
every second of our romantic cruise

06:52.348 --> 06:54.983
watching you,
assuming that's okay?

06:54.984 --> 06:56.685
Yep. That's what we're gonna do.

06:56.686 --> 06:57.886
Yeah.

06:57.887 --> 06:59.487
I'll just get rid
of this itinerary.

06:59.488 --> 07:01.221
No, no, no, no, Ames,
don't put that down.

07:01.257 --> 07:03.992
We have to find the hitman
before he finds me.

07:03.993 --> 07:05.927
I'm guessing this'll take us
all over the boat.

07:05.928 --> 07:08.430
Oh, yeah, that's
an ENAC sitch right there.

07:08.431 --> 07:09.898
"Every Nook And Cranny."

07:09.899 --> 07:13.500
Perfect. We'll just ENAC
sitch, uh, of this bitch.

07:13.536 --> 07:15.502
<i>How's it going
with your sister, sir?</i>

07:15.538 --> 07:17.138
Well, last night,
she told me in a great detail

07:17.139 --> 07:18.840
about a fight she got into
with her trainer,

07:18.841 --> 07:21.276
whom she accused
of stealing a hairbrush.

07:21.277 --> 07:24.311
Now she's on the phone,
screaming at our mother.

07:24.346 --> 07:25.579
We'll keep her out of your hair.

07:25.614 --> 07:27.181
I'm good at distracting people.

07:27.216 --> 07:28.849
It's what I do with
my toddlers all day long.

07:28.884 --> 07:32.186
How does she feel
about balloon animals?

07:32.221 --> 07:34.341
I'm sure she has a complicated
relationship with them.

07:34.356 --> 07:36.191
- Ray!
- Here she comes.

07:36.192 --> 07:37.892
No balloon animals.

07:37.893 --> 07:39.661
You ain't gonna believe
Mom's take on this.

07:39.662 --> 07:42.030
She thinks I'm the one
who should apologize

07:42.031 --> 07:43.598
just 'cause it turns out
the hairbrush

07:43.599 --> 07:45.165
ended up being in my car.

07:45.201 --> 07:47.568
Yes, I'd love to discuss
your hairbrush for even more time,

07:47.603 --> 07:49.971
but I have some pressing
police matters to attend to.

07:49.972 --> 07:52.707
Look at you.
Always working.

07:52.708 --> 07:54.842
What happened
to my fun big brother?

07:54.877 --> 07:57.278
Fun? I was never fun.
You take that back.

07:57.279 --> 07:59.380
I'm sure she didn't mean
anything by it, sir.

07:59.381 --> 08:01.716
When we were little, we would
go down in the basement,

08:01.717 --> 08:03.284
and he would build us a fort.

08:03.285 --> 08:05.018
We would stay down there
all day.

08:05.054 --> 08:08.590
And Ray would sing these silly
little made-up songs.

08:08.591 --> 08:10.658
George and Ira Gershwin
did not compose

08:10.659 --> 08:12.059
silly, made-up songs.

08:12.094 --> 08:15.630
Uh, Debbie, let me
show you New York, okay?

08:15.631 --> 08:18.066
The buildings,
the subway, the bank,

08:18.067 --> 08:20.168
the dry cleaner...
I got to run some errands.

08:20.169 --> 08:21.770
Oh, that's a great idea, Gina.

08:21.771 --> 08:24.005
Debbie, I'm so sorry
I won't get a chance

08:24.006 --> 08:25.539
to see you much on your visit.

08:25.574 --> 08:26.941
Uh, no thing but a chicken wing,

08:26.942 --> 08:29.043
'cause I'm gonna be here
for six weeks.

08:29.044 --> 08:31.745
I'ma be all up
in your life, okay?

08:33.716 --> 08:35.316
I got five down.

08:35.317 --> 08:37.484
I figured out the theme.
It's boats.

08:37.520 --> 08:39.285
Okay, I get it.

08:39.321 --> 08:42.490
She's smart and lovable;
you're scrappy and lovable;

08:42.491 --> 08:44.725
together you're just
lovable and lovable.

08:44.760 --> 08:46.727
Okay, so where's
this hitman, Judy?

08:46.762 --> 08:49.062
Look, I don't know
who they sent,

08:49.098 --> 08:50.231
but he's on the boat.

08:50.232 --> 08:51.465
Check out this manifest.

08:51.500 --> 08:54.568
Somebody boarded in San Juan
named Henry Coles.

08:54.603 --> 08:56.638
Henry Street and Coles Street,

08:56.639 --> 08:58.939
that's the corner of your old
chop shop in Brooklyn.

08:58.974 --> 09:00.474
- This is an alias.
- Mm-hmm.

09:00.509 --> 09:02.544
And my porter buddy checked out
Henry Coles' cabin,

09:02.545 --> 09:03.577
He hasn't been in it yet.

09:03.612 --> 09:05.079
He's hiding somewhere
on this boat

09:05.080 --> 09:07.248
ready to jump out and kill me
at any moment.

09:07.249 --> 09:08.782
Probably creepin' around
in my closet.

09:08.818 --> 09:10.885
- Or stowed away in a lifeboat.
- Or hiding in a wall.

09:10.886 --> 09:12.085
Or holed up in the engine room.

09:12.121 --> 09:13.520
Camouflaged in the shrubbery.

09:13.556 --> 09:14.823
Predator style.

09:14.824 --> 09:16.824
No.
We are not having fun.

09:16.859 --> 09:19.159
You will not suck me in
with your wily charms.

09:20.529 --> 09:23.364
<i>Señor Gotaro, un café
con leche, sin azúcar.</i>

09:23.365 --> 09:24.431
<i>Gracias.</i>

09:24.466 --> 09:28.002
Hola, Mr. Gotaro.
Good to see you.

09:28.003 --> 09:30.104
Can I talk to Rosa
for a quick sec

09:30.105 --> 09:32.440
about some super serious
police work?

09:32.441 --> 09:33.875
I know what
you're trying to do.

09:33.876 --> 09:35.209
You brought him in here
to butter him up.

09:35.244 --> 09:37.579
Yeah, and I've been
laying it on...

09:37.580 --> 09:39.047
real thick.

09:40.115 --> 09:41.683
Mint?

09:41.684 --> 09:44.285
Okay, but you're
making a big mistake.

09:44.286 --> 09:46.019
Nobody sucks up like a Boyle.

09:46.055 --> 09:48.295
Of course, you knew that already
because you're so smart.

09:49.425 --> 09:50.692
I just did it to you.

09:50.693 --> 09:52.694
Fine, little man.

09:52.695 --> 09:55.096
- Bring it.
- Okay.

09:55.097 --> 09:56.164
Looks like you and I

09:56.165 --> 09:58.600
are in a good,
old-fashioned suck-off.

09:58.601 --> 10:00.067
Don't call it a suck-off.

10:00.102 --> 10:01.936
Why not?
Why shouldn't...

10:01.937 --> 10:03.071
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

10:03.072 --> 10:05.472
Totally, yep. Mm-hmm.
Right. Smart. Good.

10:07.243 --> 10:08.943
You brought your own
shuffleboard stick?

10:08.944 --> 10:11.112
- Mm-hmm.
- They're called tangs.

10:11.113 --> 10:12.546
You should be glad
she has her own.

10:12.581 --> 10:14.414
You don't want her messing
with another man's tang.

10:14.450 --> 10:16.184
There is no way
they're called tangs.

10:16.185 --> 10:17.351
It's true. They are.

10:17.386 --> 10:19.554
And the disks
are called biscuits.

10:20.856 --> 10:22.923
- Yes.
- Tangs and biscuits?

10:22.958 --> 10:24.224
That is so dumb.

10:24.260 --> 10:26.694
I officially love shuffleboard.

10:26.695 --> 10:29.196
Clear a path!
I'm about to whip my biscuit!

10:29.231 --> 10:31.299
Yah!

10:31.300 --> 10:33.067
Whoo.

10:33.068 --> 10:35.670
About time you smiled, Jake.

10:35.671 --> 10:37.537
You've been a real
tang in the mud.

10:37.573 --> 10:39.273
- All right.
- Hey, little advice.

10:39.308 --> 10:40.708
Amy is great.

10:40.709 --> 10:41.976
You want to keep her,

10:41.977 --> 10:43.678
be more receptive
to her interests.

10:43.679 --> 10:45.513
All right, now you're
taking it too far, Judy.

10:45.514 --> 10:48.616
I don't need relationship advice
from my criminal archnemesis.

10:48.617 --> 10:50.137
Look, I just want
to see you two happy.

10:50.152 --> 10:51.853
No. This is just
another one of your lies,

10:51.854 --> 10:53.253
just like your fake hitman.

10:53.289 --> 10:54.656
There is a hitman on this boat.

10:54.657 --> 10:56.824
Henry Coles
is coming to kill me.

10:56.825 --> 10:58.792
Excuse me?

10:58.827 --> 11:00.528
- What?
- You said my name.

11:00.529 --> 11:01.795
I'm Henry Coles.

11:01.830 --> 11:02.829
You're Henry Coles?

11:02.831 --> 11:04.564
According to
my medical alert bracelet.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.167
Well, this is interesting.

11:06.168 --> 11:08.302
This is Henry Coles.
Let's just take a look at that.

11:08.337 --> 11:11.371
Oh, it says,
"Doug Judy is a liar."

11:11.407 --> 11:14.107
Actually,
it says I'm a fall risk.

11:14.143 --> 11:17.811
Okay, you're kind of
ruining my burn here, Henry.

11:17.846 --> 11:21.249
I knew it. I knew Henry Coles
was a 90-year old man

11:21.250 --> 11:22.850
with type 1 diabetes
and emphysema.

11:22.851 --> 11:24.285
Obviously, I didn't know
those specifics,

11:24.286 --> 11:25.486
but I knew you were lying.

11:25.487 --> 11:26.721
So Henry Coles wasn't the guy.

11:26.722 --> 11:27.789
My bad.

11:27.790 --> 11:28.990
There's still somebody
on this boat

11:28.991 --> 11:29.991
who wants to kill me.

11:29.992 --> 11:30.992
You're trying to get away,

11:30.993 --> 11:32.393
and it's not gonna happen.

11:32.394 --> 11:34.127
We're spending the rest
of this trip in your cabin.

11:34.163 --> 11:35.463
Amy and I will take sleep shifts

11:35.464 --> 11:37.064
to make sure someone's
always watching you.

11:37.099 --> 11:40.735
Thank you. That makes me
feel super safe.

11:41.870 --> 11:43.538
And if you want to smush,
I have a sleep mask

11:43.539 --> 11:46.207
and noise canceling headphones.

11:46.208 --> 11:48.042
Can't we just lock him
up in there?

11:48.043 --> 11:50.078
Do we really have to trade off
sleep for the next six nights?

11:50.079 --> 11:51.478
I know. I'm sorry.

11:51.513 --> 11:54.915
But he did say that he'd wear
a mask if we want to smush.

11:54.950 --> 11:57.752
Fine. I get it.
He's the Pontiac Bandit.

11:57.753 --> 11:58.952
You take the first shift.

11:58.988 --> 12:01.421
Thank you so much.
You're the best.

12:02.658 --> 12:04.758
Hey, NYPD!
Let him go!

12:07.896 --> 12:09.363
Now do you believe me?

12:09.398 --> 12:10.598
That guy was trying to kill me.

12:10.599 --> 12:12.467
All right, fine!
Someone wants you dead!

tell yourself.

12:29.661 --> 12:32.129

him out of his shell

12:32.164 --> 12:33.564
Tell me about it.

12:33.565 --> 12:36.533
Every time we get emotional,
he's like, "Noice, smort."

12:36.568 --> 12:38.101
Okay, can we focus up here?

12:38.137 --> 12:39.737
We still don't know
what your hitman looks like,

12:39.738 --> 12:41.506
so we're gonna have
to flush him out.

12:41.507 --> 12:42.573
Wait a minute.

12:42.574 --> 12:43.974
Where do the toilets
on this boat go?

You don't want to know.

12:45.110 --> 12:46.643

12:46.678 --> 12:49.013
- Ocean.

12:49.014 --> 12:50.214
That's where my shrimp live.

12:50.215 --> 12:51.516
Anyways, he'll probably
try to hit me

12:51.517 --> 12:53.251
at my show this afternoon.

12:53.252 --> 12:55.386
At least I'll die
doing what I love:

12:55.387 --> 12:56.920
getting people horny at sea.

12:56.955 --> 12:58.555
Yeah. Yeah.
That's gross.

12:58.590 --> 12:59.991
All right, here's the plan.

12:59.992 --> 13:02.092
We're gonna leave you alone
on stage and dangle you as bait.

13:02.127 --> 13:03.661
Damn! Bait dangling?

13:03.662 --> 13:05.496
If we're up on stage with you,
it could spook him.

13:05.497 --> 13:06.931
We'll blend into the crowd,

13:06.932 --> 13:08.732
and we'll take him down
before he even gets to you.

13:08.767 --> 13:11.569
All right, I'll trust you.

13:11.570 --> 13:13.971
But if you're gonna blend in,

13:13.972 --> 13:15.605
you got to blend in.

too sexy to see anything.

17:16.647 --> 17:18.381
Well, that ends my show,
all of a sudden.

17:18.416 --> 17:19.848
You've been a great crowd.

17:19.885 --> 17:21.318
Thank you very much.

17:21.319 --> 17:22.520
He's taking me
where you smushed.

17:24.089 --> 17:26.190
Jake, help me.
I don't want to die.

17:26.191 --> 17:27.925
I'm still on second season
of "Game of Thrones."

17:27.925 --> 17:29.727
All right, just put
the knife down, okay?

17:29.728 --> 17:31.928
There's no murder
in the all-ages piano lounge.

17:31.963 --> 17:33.263
Screw you, pig.

17:33.298 --> 17:35.065
That is not a very all-ages
thing to say.

17:35.066 --> 17:37.034
You just don't get
the vibe here at all.

17:39.237 --> 17:41.371
Whoo!
Nice, grab that cord.

17:41.406 --> 17:43.673
Let's get his arms.
Come here.

17:43.708 --> 17:45.976
You just got tanged
by my girlfriend.

17:45.977 --> 17:47.578
Sorry, I know that sounded
really gross,

17:47.579 --> 17:48.879
but it was actually awesome.

17:48.880 --> 17:50.748
You okay, Judy?

17:50.749 --> 17:51.982
Judy!

17:51.983 --> 17:54.919
No. No, no, no, no, no.

17:56.621 --> 17:58.889
Bye, Peralta.
Thanks for saving my life.

17:58.890 --> 18:01.291
No. Judy!
Don't do this!

18:01.326 --> 18:02.792
No, not again!

18:02.828 --> 18:05.662
Judy! Judy!

18:08.057 --> 18:09.758
Where is Judy?
I've looked everywhere.

18:09.759 --> 18:11.726
He has to be somewhere
on this boat.

18:11.727 --> 18:12.994
Peralta!

18:12.995 --> 18:14.361
No, he doesn't.

18:14.397 --> 18:16.797
Sorry to do this to you, man.

18:16.833 --> 18:18.599
I saw an opening,
and I had to take it.

18:18.634 --> 18:20.701
I can't go to jail.
I'm too cool.

18:20.736 --> 18:22.504
You'll never get away
from me, Judy!

18:22.505 --> 18:23.904
I can't hear what you're saying.

18:23.940 --> 18:25.206
You're real far away.

18:25.241 --> 18:27.242
I'll just assume
you're finally admitting

18:27.243 --> 18:28.476
we're best friends.

18:28.511 --> 18:29.944
No, that is not what I'm saying!

18:29.979 --> 18:32.279
Thank you.
It means a lot to me.

18:32.315 --> 18:34.281
Enjoy the rest of your cruise.

18:34.317 --> 18:36.284
Just remember,
you got a fine lady.

18:36.285 --> 18:38.286
Don't be a tang in the mud.

18:38.287 --> 18:39.820
Check your pockets!

18:41.357 --> 18:43.624
Boom-Boom Stateroom, baby!

18:43.659 --> 18:45.093
Awesome.

18:45.094 --> 18:46.495
But this isn't over!

18:46.496 --> 18:48.762
I will hunt you
to the ends of the Earth!

18:48.798 --> 18:50.065
I love you too!

18:50.066 --> 18:52.466
I'm so proud of us
for being able to say it.

18:52.502 --> 18:54.168
What are you still
standing there for?

18:54.203 --> 18:56.170
- Go smush!
- Judy!

18:56.205 --> 18:58.405
No!

18:58.441 --> 19:01.276
Well, okay, but my train
is in 45 minutes.

19:01.277 --> 19:02.677
I don't have to say
good-bye to Ray.

19:02.678 --> 19:03.918
I don't want to stress him out.

19:03.946 --> 19:06.213
No, he specifically
asked us to get you.

19:08.017 --> 19:10.752
Hello, Debbie.

19:10.753 --> 19:12.820
You made a fort?

19:12.855 --> 19:14.289
I thought we could
talk under here

19:14.290 --> 19:15.356
about you and Gary.

19:15.391 --> 19:16.857
Well...

19:20.863 --> 19:22.230
I'm sorry I was
pushing you away.

19:23.432 --> 19:24.965
I want you to know
that I'm here for you,

19:25.001 --> 19:27.268
and I would love to be

19:27.303 --> 19:29.003
all up in your life.

19:29.038 --> 19:30.805
Aw, you...

19:30.806 --> 19:32.506
- Give me a hug.
- Okay.

19:32.542 --> 19:34.642
All right.

19:35.678 --> 19:37.846
Mr. Gotaro.

19:37.847 --> 19:39.781
You're under arrest
for the murder of your tenant

19:39.782 --> 19:41.116
Shirley Crouch.

19:41.117 --> 19:42.850
What are you talking about?

19:42.885 --> 19:44.786
Is this because
I didn't rent to you?

19:44.787 --> 19:46.087
No.

19:46.088 --> 19:47.389
But that was suspicious.

19:47.390 --> 19:48.723
Why wouldn't you want
cops with great credit

19:48.724 --> 19:49.824
living in your building?

19:49.825 --> 19:50.992
Great credit and an eel hookup.

19:50.993 --> 19:52.260
Because you murdered her.

19:52.261 --> 19:54.128
Toxicology report says
the old lady was poisoned.

19:54.163 --> 19:55.297
Her apartment
was rent controlled,

19:55.298 --> 19:56.298
and you couldn't
jack up the price

19:56.299 --> 19:57.632
until she was out of there.

19:57.633 --> 20:00.335
I just have one last question.

20:00.336 --> 20:02.070
If you go to jail,
who makes the rental decisions

20:02.071 --> 20:03.138
in the building?

20:03.139 --> 20:04.573
It'll pass to a trust.

20:04.574 --> 20:05.607
The bank controls it.

20:05.608 --> 20:06.641
Game back on?

20:06.642 --> 20:07.676
If you have to ask,

20:07.677 --> 20:10.178
you're already one step behind.

20:10.179 --> 20:11.279
I should help bring him back in.

20:11.280 --> 20:12.313
- We're still police officers.
- Yeah.

20:13.883 --> 20:16.317
Hey, can I ask you something?

20:16.352 --> 20:17.485
Mm-hmm.

20:17.486 --> 20:18.653
If the toilets drain
into the ocean,

20:18.654 --> 20:20.221
does that mean a tiny shark
could swim up

20:20.222 --> 20:21.455
and bite me in the butt?

20:21.490 --> 20:23.157
No, not at all.

20:23.192 --> 20:25.693
- Psh, lame.
- Look.

20:25.728 --> 20:27.529
I know you're bummed
about the Pontiac Bandit

20:27.530 --> 20:29.030
so if it's any consolation,

20:29.031 --> 20:30.732
we could spend
the rest of the cruise

20:30.733 --> 20:31.800
eating shrimp in bed.

20:31.801 --> 20:34.169
That is incredibly sweet,
but no way.

20:34.170 --> 20:36.738
We have too many
activities to do.

20:36.739 --> 20:39.107
Eh? You'll never guess
what starts in three minutes.

20:39.108 --> 20:41.151
- Salsa dancing.
- Oh, so you can guess.
