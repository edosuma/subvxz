WEBVTT

01:08.695 --> 01:10.029
Your Highness?

01:16.161 --> 01:17.912
Charge!

01:28.298 --> 01:29.674
Charge!

04:52.460 --> 04:56.297
Save yourselves!
Save yourselves!

04:58.216 --> 04:59.258
Pull back!

04:59.342 --> 05:01.928
For the love of God,
save yourselves!

05:05.264 --> 05:07.266
Retreat. Retreat!

05:07.975 --> 05:09.394
Retreat!

05:27.495 --> 05:30.707
Yeah! Yeah, they run!

05:35.044 --> 05:36.421
Yes!

05:55.940 --> 05:58.985
Yes! Ah, we won!

05:59.110 --> 06:00.278
Yes!

06:01.988 --> 06:04.115
What are you so happy about?

06:06.951 --> 06:08.703
It is not over yet!

06:20.298 --> 06:21.799
Open the gate!

06:29.682 --> 06:30.850
Hurry!

06:40.485 --> 06:43.946
We are defeated.
They'll be here soon.

06:44.030 --> 06:46.949
Father, Sire, wife,
we have no choice.

06:47.033 --> 06:49.952
We have to leave here at once
and find safety elsewhere.
Go! Now.

06:50.036 --> 06:52.830
- I will pack a few things.
- Come on, boys.

06:53.247 --> 06:55.041
Father, did you
not hear me?

06:55.124 --> 06:56.626
We have to go. Now!

06:56.709 --> 06:58.336
I cannot leave this place.

06:58.669 --> 07:00.421
Father, you are the King!

07:00.505 --> 07:02.465
I cannot allow the king
of our country

07:02.548 --> 07:05.259
to fall into the hands
of our enemies!

07:10.264 --> 07:13.768
I'm not talking
about you as a man,
but as a king.

07:15.520 --> 07:18.272
I will renounce the crown
in your favor.

07:18.856 --> 07:22.235
We'll have a short ceremony.
Quick.
Go fetch Bishop Edmund.

07:28.241 --> 07:32.203
I can't
begin to understand
your thinking

07:34.455 --> 07:37.708
but I can't just
leave you here to die.

07:39.168 --> 07:43.923
My son, I ask you to
trust me this one last time.

07:46.509 --> 07:48.511
This is God's will.

07:50.596 --> 07:52.348
It's also mine.

07:59.188 --> 08:01.274
Now, go fetch Bishop Edmund.

08:08.698 --> 08:13.077
Do you, Ecbert,
anointed King of Wessex,
Mercia, East Anglia,

08:13.578 --> 08:16.789
Cornwall, Bretwalda,
King of Kings,

08:17.248 --> 08:20.585
in the sight of God Almighty,
renounce all your thrones
and kingdoms

08:20.668 --> 08:23.838
in favor of your son and heir,
Prince Aethelwulf?

08:26.674 --> 08:29.719
I do, so help me, God.

08:30.428 --> 08:35.308
So, let me remove from you
the sacred emblems
and signs of your kingship.

08:36.851 --> 08:40.521
I give this holy
scepter into your hands,
Prince Aethelwulf.

08:42.064 --> 08:43.524
And with this ancient crown,

08:45.776 --> 08:49.322
I do make thee King
over all those
places and kingdoms

08:49.405 --> 08:52.116
once ruled by your father,
but now by you instead.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.869
In the name of the Father,
Son,
and Holy Ghost,

08:54.952 --> 08:58.497
I crown you King Aethelwulf.

08:58.748 --> 09:00.458
May God save and protect you,

09:00.750 --> 09:03.294
all the days of your life.
Sire.

09:04.962 --> 09:06.172
Now, please hurry!

09:23.898 --> 09:25.483
No more space!

09:25.900 --> 09:27.068
Wait!

09:30.154 --> 09:31.697
We're leaving!

09:33.449 --> 09:36.494
I want you to go,
get them in the cart. Go! Go!

09:36.994 --> 09:38.245
Formation!

09:38.329 --> 09:40.081
Sire! Sire!

09:40.331 --> 09:41.499
Father!

09:41.874 --> 09:46.545
My son. I know I have
placed my kingdom
in the safest hands.

09:46.629 --> 09:50.132
Now, you go now,
you save yourself
and your family,

09:50.216 --> 09:52.510
but only that you can
re-gather your strength,

09:52.593 --> 09:54.095
and take back what is yours.

09:54.178 --> 09:56.514
It's all my plan.
God help me!

09:59.183 --> 10:01.352
Boys,
straight into the carriage!

10:01.435 --> 10:03.813
- My sweet Judith!
- Come on! Hurry!

10:03.896 --> 10:07.274
Hail and farewell.
I think I know

10:07.566 --> 10:09.944
what it is that is
left for me to do.

10:10.027 --> 10:12.196
I cannot run away from it now.

10:14.907 --> 10:17.702
Thank you for loving me.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.161
Love is everything.

10:20.246 --> 10:23.666
All shall be well.
All shall be well.

10:23.749 --> 10:27.628
Now... Now, you...
You have a destiny, Alfred,

10:27.712 --> 10:28.754
that you cannot escape.

10:28.879 --> 10:30.006
So you better get used to it.

10:30.214 --> 10:32.883
In the meantime,
listen and learn.

10:32.967 --> 10:35.011
Listen to the highest
and the lowest.

10:35.094 --> 10:38.097
Learn from the prince,
and from the shepherd.

10:38.389 --> 10:39.890
And, remember,

10:40.558 --> 10:45.229
the greatest Christian virtue,
Alfred, is humility.

10:46.439 --> 10:48.315
Thank you, Grandfather.

10:49.400 --> 10:50.401
I love you.

10:52.069 --> 10:53.237
And I you.

10:55.072 --> 10:58.909
Now, you take care
of your brother
for he is special, too.

10:58.993 --> 11:00.119
And your mother.

11:00.202 --> 11:01.162
We have to go.

11:01.245 --> 11:03.831
Yes, yes! Go, go! Go, go!

11:07.084 --> 11:11.839
And farewell, Bishop Edmund,
my dear vintner.

11:12.548 --> 11:14.967
May God bless you
and keep you.

11:15.718 --> 11:19.013
I am going nowhere, Sire.
I am staying here with you.

11:19.096 --> 11:22.933
Thank you.
This is a sacred site.

11:23.476 --> 11:27.021
Now, how should I, a Bishop
of God's holy church,
abandon Him now?

11:27.104 --> 11:29.482
Besides, the cellars
are still stocked

11:29.565 --> 11:31.567
with some of the finest
wines in Christendom!

11:31.650 --> 11:34.195
Mmm.
Am I supposed to
leave them to the pagans

11:34.278 --> 11:36.363
who don't know
the difference between
one grape and another?

11:36.489 --> 11:37.948
Let's go!

11:39.283 --> 11:42.119
May God be with you all!

11:42.953 --> 11:46.040
Now and forever!

12:02.139 --> 12:04.183
Let's move! Go!

12:25.412 --> 12:28.916
We pray to the gods
for the success
of the great army.

12:30.793 --> 12:33.087
I remember when
Ragnar left these shores

12:33.170 --> 12:35.339
in a single boat.
He had a dream.

12:36.090 --> 12:38.425
He wanted to
find distant lands.

12:38.676 --> 12:42.513
He wanted our people
to settle and
thrive in those lands.

12:42.847 --> 12:46.350
Perhaps now,
his sons can
realize his dreams.

12:48.894 --> 12:50.229
I hope so.

12:52.273 --> 12:54.984
And I pray to the gods
to make it so.

12:56.193 --> 13:00.573
It seems the gods
are not always on our side.

13:00.739 --> 13:02.867
You are the new generation.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.452
You don't understand
the gods as we do.

13:07.037 --> 13:09.456
The gods are not always
meant to be understood.

13:09.707 --> 13:11.542
That is part of their power.

13:11.876 --> 13:15.379
What you have to understand
is that our gods

13:15.462 --> 13:19.592
are fighting a life-and-death
struggle with this
new Christian God.

13:19.717 --> 13:21.802
That is really
what my son is doing.

13:21.886 --> 13:24.013
Nothing else is so important,

13:24.096 --> 13:27.266
for if we lose
our ancient gods,

13:27.725 --> 13:29.894
what is the point of living?

13:42.823 --> 13:44.241
Mmm.

13:58.923 --> 14:00.382
Mmm.

14:44.134 --> 14:45.719
Charge!

15:00.442 --> 15:01.652
Go!

15:04.071 --> 15:05.489
Move!

15:29.596 --> 15:31.890
Be careful.
It could be a trap.

15:32.516 --> 15:34.143
You! Follow us!

16:07.676 --> 16:09.053
It's empty.

16:09.845 --> 16:11.055
They've gone!

16:28.655 --> 16:29.865
Burn it!

16:31.033 --> 16:33.160
Break it open!
Break it all!

16:34.078 --> 16:36.413
Rip it!
Let me have it! It is mine!

16:38.082 --> 16:39.500
Rubbish! Nothing!

17:42.104 --> 17:43.480
Oh, it's valuable!

18:39.536 --> 18:40.871
Stop!

18:50.839 --> 18:52.049
This is King Ecbert!

18:55.636 --> 18:57.638
I order you to spare him.

20:17.050 --> 20:21.221
Tanaruz,
don't be afraid. Trust me.

20:21.304 --> 20:22.973
You must trust me.

20:24.099 --> 20:25.475
I love you.

20:27.519 --> 20:28.895
I love you.

21:03.346 --> 21:04.514
Helga!

21:07.350 --> 21:09.269
Helga! Helga!

21:11.646 --> 21:13.190
No, no!

21:16.151 --> 21:17.694
I am happy now.

21:20.489 --> 21:22.908
I get to see my Angrboda.

21:26.411 --> 21:28.371
Helga! Helga!

21:33.126 --> 21:35.462
You are not like anybody else.

21:36.713 --> 21:39.299
Be yourself, Floki.

21:40.550 --> 21:44.721
This world,
it is too small for you.

21:52.896 --> 21:54.648
No, Helga!

23:14.811 --> 23:18.773
When Balder,
Odin's beloved son, died,

23:20.066 --> 23:22.152
not only did people weep.

23:24.112 --> 23:25.697
But fire wept.

23:30.744 --> 23:34.706
And iron and all
the other metals wept.

23:38.793 --> 23:42.839
The stones wept. Earth wept.

23:46.259 --> 23:50.222
Farewell, voyager.

23:51.848 --> 23:55.644
Farewell, my heart, farewell.

23:59.189 --> 24:00.523
For now.

24:22.254 --> 24:24.130
We have to decide

24:24.214 --> 24:27.676
what to do
with King Ecbert!

24:30.095 --> 24:33.390
I don't understand.
What is there to discuss?

24:34.432 --> 24:35.809
We Blood Eagle him.

24:35.934 --> 24:39.229
Ecbert is as guilty as Aelle
so we should do
the same thing to him.

24:40.146 --> 24:42.983
I have told you
this too many times,
brothers. I was here!

24:43.066 --> 24:45.944
I saw Ecbert hand Father
over to King Aelle.

24:46.027 --> 24:47.904
We all understand
those feelings, Ivar.

24:48.071 --> 24:50.490
No one is denying
what you are saying.

24:50.573 --> 24:52.158
But sometimes...

24:52.367 --> 24:56.288
Sometimes,
we have to consider things
beyond our feelings.

24:56.371 --> 24:58.623
And think what is
best for our people!

24:58.707 --> 25:03.169
I know what our
people want, Bjorn.
And they want what I want.

25:04.337 --> 25:07.299
We have to consider
our position of strength.

25:08.466 --> 25:11.928
And use that to our
ultimate advantage!

25:13.972 --> 25:15.682
You always like
to complicate
things, Bjorn.

25:15.765 --> 25:18.184
You think it
makes you look clever.

25:18.351 --> 25:20.854
And what if we
kill Ecbert, Ivar?
What then?

25:21.604 --> 25:23.273
Well, then he's dead, Ubbe!

25:23.481 --> 25:25.608
We are in the middle
of an enemy kingdom.

25:25.692 --> 25:27.819
How long will it be
before the Saxon forces

25:27.902 --> 25:30.030
gather up another army
and drive us away?

25:30.113 --> 25:33.867
Exactly!
So we Blood Eagle Ecbert
and then we move on.

25:33.950 --> 25:35.994
We raid this entire land,

25:36.077 --> 25:37.537
so that they
never have a chance

25:37.620 --> 25:39.289
to assemble
another army again.

25:39.372 --> 25:41.458
Why would we even
want to stay here?

25:41.541 --> 25:43.460
It is what our father wanted.

25:44.044 --> 25:47.213
He didn't just
want to win battles.
He wanted land here.

25:47.297 --> 25:48.548
He wanted
to make settlements,

25:48.631 --> 25:50.550
so our people could live
and they could work.

25:50.633 --> 25:52.385
Mmm. And we all
know what happened.

25:52.469 --> 25:56.931
Yes, but in those days,
he did not hold
a king to ransom,

25:57.682 --> 26:00.894
nor did he have a great army.
We do.

26:03.271 --> 26:07.859
What about you, Sigurd?
You've been very quiet so far.

26:09.652 --> 26:11.112
I'm sure you have an opinion.

26:13.990 --> 26:15.241
I agree with you, Ivar.

26:16.076 --> 26:17.285
Excuse me?

26:18.870 --> 26:20.246
We should Blood Eagle him.

26:20.330 --> 26:22.082
Finally, thank you.

26:22.290 --> 26:24.918
But I'm not sure.
I'm not sure
what they're saying.

26:26.002 --> 26:31.674
What I am saying
is that we should do
what our father always wanted.

26:38.681 --> 26:39.849
Yes?

26:39.933 --> 26:41.601
I'd like to speak.

26:44.312 --> 26:48.441
Well, I understand
most of what you say,

26:48.525 --> 26:52.362
and I speak a little
of your language now.

26:58.201 --> 27:00.161
I loved your father.

27:02.288 --> 27:03.915
He was my friend.

27:05.667 --> 27:07.961
And I know that,
more than anything,

27:08.044 --> 27:11.005
he wanted to build
a farming community here.

27:12.757 --> 27:15.176
And you
killed all the settlers.

27:15.260 --> 27:17.220
Yes. It's true. I did.

27:18.388 --> 27:22.767
But now
the tables have turned.

27:23.476 --> 27:25.728
We can make a new deal.

27:28.231 --> 27:30.233
What are you proposing?

27:30.608 --> 27:32.235
Well, as you say,

27:33.236 --> 27:36.906
it's only a matter of time
before you are
driven away from here.

27:36.990 --> 27:41.411
Without any legal
right to English lands,
you have no hope of staying.

27:43.121 --> 27:47.792
Well, I am King of Kings.

27:48.960 --> 27:51.421
And I can give you
that legal right.

27:56.301 --> 28:00.847
I will give you legal claim
to the Kingdom of East Anglia.

28:00.930 --> 28:02.557
It's a large kingdom.

28:02.640 --> 28:06.269
Because I am king,
no one can
question that claim.

28:06.436 --> 28:12.275
And it seems that
you have enough men
to enforce it until it holds.

28:15.653 --> 28:20.533
That's my offer.
You should consider it.

28:31.252 --> 28:33.338
What do you want in return?

28:37.592 --> 28:42.138
I'll only tell you that
once you agree to my proposal.

29:00.657 --> 29:04.661
Not that I need to ask,
but what is your opinion?

29:06.371 --> 29:09.999
About whether to
accept the gift of land
from King Ecbert?

29:10.667 --> 29:11.751
Yes.

29:13.962 --> 29:16.422
Well, since you do ask me,

29:17.340 --> 29:20.260
my opinion is that we
should take the land.

29:21.135 --> 29:23.346
But I have one condition...

29:26.182 --> 29:27.850
That Ecbert dies.

29:29.185 --> 29:31.187
And that I Blood Eagle him.

29:32.939 --> 29:35.066
Otherwise, there is no deal.

29:37.193 --> 29:38.570
You wouldn't be
able to stand up

29:38.653 --> 29:40.905
long enough to
Blood Eagle him.

29:41.239 --> 29:43.074
I imagine me sitting.

30:08.182 --> 30:10.351
I accept your offer of land.

30:13.229 --> 30:15.732
But for what you
did to my father,

30:17.442 --> 30:18.985
you must die.

30:22.322 --> 30:25.450
Then I'll tell you
what it is I want.

30:28.244 --> 30:32.540
All I want is to
choose the manner

30:33.166 --> 30:34.917
of my own death.

30:45.928 --> 30:47.180
I agree.

31:13.456 --> 31:17.126
Bjorn Ironside,
son of Ragnar,

31:17.585 --> 31:18.961
I, King Ecbert,

31:19.837 --> 31:24.008
give you the right
to settle the lands
of East Anglia.

31:27.136 --> 31:29.138
And I pray you succeed.

31:33.810 --> 31:34.936
And now,

31:37.230 --> 31:39.524
I have a final
journey to take.

32:13.766 --> 32:16.352
I was sorry to hear
of Helga's death.

32:18.980 --> 32:21.274
We knew each
other a long time.

32:22.692 --> 32:24.444
Since I was a boy.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.531
I, too, am dead, Bjorn.

32:30.658 --> 32:33.744
A part of me died
with my daughter Angrboda,

32:35.496 --> 32:37.540
a second part with Ragnar,

32:38.958 --> 32:43.212
and the last part
of what was Floki died
with my sweet, sad Helga.

32:49.802 --> 32:51.804
What I am now is nothing.

32:55.558 --> 32:59.729
And all this nothing
I give to the gods,
to do with as they please.

33:01.772 --> 33:04.650
And I shall be an empty ship
with no rudder,

33:04.734 --> 33:07.028
set upon their endless sea,

33:09.280 --> 33:11.199
and where they take me,

33:12.742 --> 33:14.160
I shall go.

33:38.518 --> 33:40.144
Take care, Bjorn.

34:38.619 --> 34:39.954
Thank you.

35:32.965 --> 35:35.217
<i>All my
future lies with Ragnar.</i>

35:36.260 --> 35:40.389
<i>The only person
you truly care
for is yourself.</i>

35:40.973 --> 35:43.559
<i>I give myself freely to you.</i>

35:44.393 --> 35:46.896
<i>Thank you,
Grandfather. I love you.</i>

35:50.566 --> 35:55.279
<i>I crown you King of Wessex
and Mercia.</i>

35:58.783 --> 36:00.618
<i>They will avenge me.</i>

36:05.498 --> 36:07.333
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

37:51.395 --> 37:52.646
Friends,

37:54.356 --> 37:57.693
no one will ever
be able to doubt
what we have achieved!

37:58.569 --> 38:00.446
An army of all our peoples,

38:02.031 --> 38:06.911
and we have defeated not one,
but two English kingdoms!

38:10.915 --> 38:13.876
For us, the sons of Ragnar,

38:14.919 --> 38:19.882
our first duty was to avenge
our father's death,
and that we have done.

38:20.841 --> 38:22.468
But also,

38:22.593 --> 38:25.513
we have achieved
my father's dream.

38:26.639 --> 38:30.226
We have the legal
right to the land,
and to farm here!

38:31.894 --> 38:35.147
It is up to all of you
to use this opportunity

38:35.231 --> 38:38.192
to send over new settlers
and young families!

38:39.276 --> 38:41.570
Unfortunately,
I will not be here to see

38:41.737 --> 38:43.989
this new
settlement grow and thrive.

38:44.657 --> 38:46.951
My fate will
take me elsewhere.

38:48.577 --> 38:52.456
I always knew I had to return
to explore
the Mediterranean Sea.

38:52.706 --> 38:55.501
And now I feel free
to follow my destiny.

38:55.584 --> 38:58.963
But my brothers
will be here for you.

38:59.964 --> 39:01.507
<i>Skol!</i>

39:01.590 --> 39:03.092
<i>Skol!</i>

39:05.511 --> 39:10.432
I will be here,
but not to
settle down and plow!

39:11.392 --> 39:14.937
Who wants to be a farmer now?
Hmm?

39:15.354 --> 39:18.190
We have a great army
and we should use it!

39:18.399 --> 39:22.111
There are many other places
that I want to
attack and raid!

39:22.861 --> 39:25.447
And those of you
who feel like I do,

39:26.115 --> 39:28.242
you should come with me.

39:28.325 --> 39:32.121
And those of you who don't,
ask yourself,

39:32.204 --> 39:35.207
who can stand in our way now?

39:40.713 --> 39:43.007
You cannot lead the army,
Ivar. Hmm?

39:43.799 --> 39:45.676
I don't want to, Ubbe.

39:45.843 --> 39:48.887
All I'm saying is that
for those who are
still brave enough

39:48.971 --> 39:51.140
to raid and find adventure,

39:51.307 --> 39:53.309
then I will lead them.

39:54.018 --> 39:57.396
You can put on an apron
and settle down
if you want to.

39:57.479 --> 39:59.273
It will
take a great man, Ivar,

40:01.025 --> 40:03.235
to stake a claim here,
defend it.

40:05.029 --> 40:08.282
Ah... That does not
sound like yourself,
dear brother.

40:08.782 --> 40:12.244
The Hvitserk I know,
he loves to raid.
He's a real Viking.

40:13.621 --> 40:16.665
What you just said,
that is not the Viking way.

40:17.499 --> 40:18.500
So...

40:21.503 --> 40:23.714
Who among you will follow me?

40:24.757 --> 40:27.676
Who will follow
me into battle,

40:27.760 --> 40:32.306
for the love of fame
and for the love of Odin,
our All-Father?

40:32.431 --> 40:34.099
Yeah!

40:38.520 --> 40:39.855
Odin!

40:41.023 --> 40:42.107
Don't do this, Ivar.

40:42.858 --> 40:45.903
We are all the sons of Ragnar.
We have to stick together.

40:45.986 --> 40:48.822
Frankly, dear Sigurd,
I don't care what you say.

40:48.906 --> 40:52.076
The truth is,
I wouldn't even
piss down your throat

40:52.159 --> 40:53.827
even if your lungs
were on fire.

40:59.083 --> 41:02.795
Well, maybe that's because
you're not really a man.

41:03.879 --> 41:05.589
Are you, Boneless?

41:08.092 --> 41:10.636
So, who is
going to stay and farm?

41:10.803 --> 41:12.888
I would like to stay.

41:14.056 --> 41:16.058
But I have other plans.

41:16.392 --> 41:17.518
<i>Skol.</i>

41:17.601 --> 41:18.686
<i>Skol!</i>

41:19.061 --> 41:20.437
As for me,

41:23.023 --> 41:24.983
I want to go with Bjorn.

41:26.527 --> 41:28.904
I want to see
the Mediterranean.

41:32.491 --> 41:33.575
Then it seems

41:36.412 --> 41:37.746
the only thing

41:39.623 --> 41:42.376
that really kept the sons
of Ragnar together

41:42.459 --> 41:44.044
was the death
of their father.

41:44.128 --> 41:46.296
Poor Bjorn! It is you

41:46.380 --> 41:48.465
who doesn't want
to keep the army together.

41:48.549 --> 41:51.719
It is you who wants to
go away to sunny places.

41:52.511 --> 41:54.638
Everyone else can follow me.

41:55.597 --> 41:58.058
I do not want to
follow you, Ivar.

41:58.475 --> 42:01.520
You are crazy.
You have the mind of a child!

42:01.812 --> 42:04.690
And all you do is
play music, Sigurd!

42:05.107 --> 42:07.192
I'm just as much
a son of Ragnar as you are.

42:07.276 --> 42:09.111
I'm not so sure.

42:09.194 --> 42:12.239
As far as I remember,
Ragnar didn't play the oud.

42:12.322 --> 42:15.159
And he certainly
didn't offer his arse
to other men.

42:16.702 --> 42:17.953
You make me laugh!

42:18.036 --> 42:20.539
Just like you
do when you crawl
around like a baby.

42:20.622 --> 42:21.707
Shut your mouth!

42:21.790 --> 42:22.875
Enough!

42:22.958 --> 42:24.626
This has nothing
to do with you!

42:24.710 --> 42:27.004
What's the matter, Ivar?
You can't take it?

42:27.087 --> 42:28.380
Ivar, do not listen to him.

42:28.464 --> 42:31.091
No, I guess it must
be hard for you now
that your mommy's dead,

42:31.175 --> 42:34.136
knowing she's the only one
who ever really loved you.

42:34.887 --> 42:36.764
Ivar. Ivar!

43:05.584 --> 43:06.668
No.

43:09.797 --> 43:11.215
No! No!

43:57.553 --> 43:59.513
- Amen.
- Amen.

44:19.241 --> 44:20.868
Thank you,
Bishop Heahmund.

44:21.952 --> 44:25.664
My husband has gone
to a better place.
I know that.

44:27.833 --> 44:30.502
The Lord will find
ways to console you.
