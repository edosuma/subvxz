WEBVTT

02:36.489 --> 02:37.739
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

02:37.824 --> 02:41.702
First off, I'd like to thank this board for
taking the time to hear my proposal.

02:41.744 --> 02:44.246
Now, we've all heard
of the legend of Atlantis,

02:44.289 --> 02:46.415
a continent somewhere
in the mid-Atlantic

02:46.457 --> 02:48.292
that was home
to an advanced civilization,

02:48.376 --> 02:50.711
possessing technology
far beyond our own,

02:51.087 --> 02:53.005
that, according to our friend Plato here,

02:53.089 --> 02:55.591
was suddenly struck
by some cataclysmic event

02:55.633 --> 02:57.217
that sank it beneath the sea.

02:57.594 --> 03:00.012
Now, some of you may ask,
why Atlantis?

03:00.096 --> 03:01.930
It's just a myth, isn't it?

03:01.973 --> 03:03.140
Pure fantasy.

03:03.224 --> 03:06.268
Well, that is where you'd be wrong.

03:06.686 --> 03:09.605
10,000 years
before the Egyptians built the pyramids,

03:09.689 --> 03:12.774
Atlantis had electricity,
advanced medicine,

03:12.817 --> 03:14.860
even the power of flight.
Impossible, you say?

03:14.944 --> 03:16.695
Well, no. No, not for them.

03:16.779 --> 03:18.780
Numerous ancient cultures
all over the globe agree

03:18.823 --> 03:21.617
that Atlantis possessed
a power source of some kind

03:21.701 --> 03:23.994
more powerful than steam, than coal.

03:24.078 --> 03:26.622
More powerful than our modern
internal combustion engines.

03:27.123 --> 03:30.542
Gentlemen, I propose
that we find Atlantis,

03:30.627 --> 03:32.294
find that power source,

03:32.378 --> 03:34.379
and bring it back to the surface.

03:34.464 --> 03:37.466
Now, this is a page
from an illuminated text

03:37.550 --> 03:40.636
that describes a book called
The Shepherd's Journal,

03:40.887 --> 03:43.639
said to have been
a firsthand account of Atlantis

03:43.723 --> 03:45.140
and its exact whereabouts.

03:45.308 --> 03:48.393
Now, based on a centuries-old
translation of a Norse text,

03:48.478 --> 03:50.979
historians have believed
the Journal resides in Ireland.

03:51.147 --> 03:53.941
But after comparing the text

03:53.983 --> 03:56.944
to the runes on this Viking shield,

03:56.986 --> 04:01.073
I found that one of the letters
had been mistranslated.

04:01.157 --> 04:03.408
So, by changing this letter

04:03.493 --> 04:05.535
and inserting the correct one,

04:05.620 --> 04:08.455
we find that The Shepherd's Journal,
the key to Atlantis,

04:08.498 --> 04:11.875
lies not in Ireland, gentlemen,

04:12.835 --> 04:14.503
but in Iceland.

04:16.172 --> 04:17.547
Pause for effect.

04:17.632 --> 04:21.093
Gentlemen, I'll take your questions now.

04:23.054 --> 04:26.139
Would you gentlemen
please excuse me for a moment?

04:28.184 --> 04:30.978
Cartography and Linguistics,
Milo Thatch speaking.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.982
Yeah. Just a second.

04:41.698 --> 04:43.699
Pardon me, Mr. Hickenbottom.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.580
How's that? Is that better?

04:50.665 --> 04:53.000
Yeah. You're welcome.

04:53.042 --> 04:55.377
- And don't let it happen again.
- All right, bye.

04:56.045 --> 04:58.380
Now, as you can see by the...

04:58.423 --> 05:00.716
By this map...

05:00.800 --> 05:02.509
Map that...

05:02.552 --> 05:04.761
That I've drawn, I plotted the route

05:04.846 --> 05:06.221
that will take myself and a crew

05:06.264 --> 05:08.390
to the southern coast of Iceland
to retrieve the Journal.

05:09.517 --> 05:11.226
Ah, showtime.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.104
Well, this is it.

05:14.188 --> 05:16.273
I am finally getting out of the dungeon.

05:52.268 --> 05:54.061
"Dear Mr. Thatch, this is to inform you

05:54.103 --> 05:57.606
"that your meeting today has been
moved up from 4:30 p.m. To 3:30 p.m."

05:58.816 --> 06:00.067
What?

06:01.611 --> 06:03.111
"Dear Mr. Thatch, due to your absence,

06:03.154 --> 06:04.738
"the board has voted
to reject your proposal.

06:04.781 --> 06:07.074
"Have a nice weekend.
Mr. Harcourt's office."

06:07.241 --> 06:09.242
They can't do this to me!

06:09.452 --> 06:12.954
I swear, that young Thatch
gets crazier every year.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.457
If I ever hear the word "Atlantis" again,

06:15.500 --> 06:17.459
I'll step in front of a bus.

06:17.502 --> 06:18.919
I'll push you.

06:18.961 --> 06:20.629
- Mr. Harcourt!
- Good Lord!

06:20.713 --> 06:22.798
- There he is!
- Members of the board... Wait.

06:22.882 --> 06:25.467
- How did you find us?
- Mr. Harcourt, wait!

06:25.510 --> 06:26.510
Head for the hills!

06:26.594 --> 06:27.677
Where is a guard when you need him?

06:27.762 --> 06:30.472
Mr. Harcourt, you gotta listen to me, sir!

06:31.516 --> 06:32.808
Sir?

06:35.853 --> 06:37.729
Wait! Mr. Harcourt!

06:37.980 --> 06:41.483
Sir, I have new evidence that...
Please, Mr. Harcourt!

06:41.567 --> 06:43.985
Stop! Sir, if you... Could you hold...

06:44.028 --> 06:45.654
Thank you very much. Look at...

06:45.696 --> 06:48.156
This museum funds
scientific expeditions

06:48.199 --> 06:51.660
based on facts,
not legends and folklore.

06:51.744 --> 06:53.829
Besides, we need you here.

06:53.871 --> 06:56.123
- We depend on you.
- You do?

06:56.165 --> 06:57.874
Yes. What with winter coming,

06:57.959 --> 06:59.668
that boiler's going to need
a lot of attention.

06:59.752 --> 07:01.044
- Boiler?
- Onward, Heinz!

07:02.588 --> 07:04.214
But there... There's a journal!

07:04.298 --> 07:07.008
It's in Iceland! I'm sure of it this time!

07:09.178 --> 07:11.805
Sir, I really hoped
it wouldn't come to this,

07:11.848 --> 07:16.184
but this is a letter of resignation.

07:16.227 --> 07:18.437
If you reject my proposal, I'll...

07:20.648 --> 07:22.649
I'll quit!

07:27.071 --> 07:28.196
I mean it, sir.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.198
If you refuse to fund my proposal...

07:30.241 --> 07:31.324
You'll what?

07:31.367 --> 07:33.034
Flush your career down the toilet,

07:33.119 --> 07:34.327
just like your grandfather?

07:34.370 --> 07:36.329
You have a lot of potential, Milo.

07:36.372 --> 07:38.874
Don't throw it all away
chasing fairy tales.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.376
But I can prove Atlantis exists!

07:41.419 --> 07:43.044
You want to go on an expedition?

07:43.087 --> 07:45.922
Here. Take a trolley
to the Potomac and jump in!

07:46.132 --> 07:49.050
Maybe the cold water will
clear your head. Heinz!

07:56.851 --> 07:58.477
I'm home.

07:58.561 --> 08:01.062
Fluffy? Here, kitty.

08:03.399 --> 08:06.276
Milo James Thatch?

08:07.278 --> 08:09.863
Who... Who are you?
How did you get in here?

08:09.906 --> 08:14.117
I came down the chimney. Ho, ho, ho.

08:14.202 --> 08:16.119
My name is Helga Sinclair.

08:16.204 --> 08:18.246
I'm acting on behalf of my employer,

08:18.289 --> 08:21.541
who has a most intriguing
proposition for you.

08:21.584 --> 08:23.293
Are you interested?

08:23.794 --> 08:25.587
Your employer?

08:25.630 --> 08:26.755
Who is your employer?

08:43.438 --> 08:44.689
This way, please.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.900
And don't drip on the Caravaggio.

08:47.568 --> 08:48.610
Step lively.

08:48.653 --> 08:51.279
Mr. Whitmore does not like
to be kept waiting.

08:52.448 --> 08:54.824
You will address him
as "Mr. Whitmore" or "sir."

08:54.909 --> 08:56.618
You will stand unless
asked to be seated.

08:56.702 --> 08:58.370
Keep your sentences short
and to the point.

08:58.454 --> 08:59.955
Are we clear?

09:02.875 --> 09:04.209
And relax.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.836
He doesn't bite... often.

09:14.136 --> 09:15.303
Grandpa?

09:15.555 --> 09:17.305
Finest explorer I ever met.

09:17.348 --> 09:20.141
Preston Whitmore.
Pleasure to meet you, Milo.

09:21.811 --> 09:22.978
Join me in a little yoga?

09:23.062 --> 09:24.896
No, no. Thank you.

09:25.147 --> 09:26.356
Did you really know my grandfather?

09:26.482 --> 09:29.484
Oh, yeah. Met old Thaddeus
back in Georgetown.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.821
Class of '66. We stayed close friends
till the end of his days.

09:33.281 --> 09:34.948
Even dragged me along

09:34.991 --> 09:36.741
on some of his danged fool expeditions.

09:36.826 --> 09:39.369
Thatch was crazy as a fruit bat, he was.

09:39.453 --> 09:40.495
He spoke of you often.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.664
Funny. He never mentioned you.

09:42.748 --> 09:45.000
Oh, he wouldn't.
He knew how much I like my privacy.

09:47.295 --> 09:48.378
I keep a low profile.

09:48.462 --> 09:50.297
Mr. Whitmore, should I be
wondering why I'm here?

09:50.339 --> 09:51.381
Look on that table.

09:54.343 --> 09:55.385
It's for you.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.597
It's from my grandfather.

09:58.681 --> 10:00.640
He brought that package
to me years ago.

10:00.683 --> 10:02.183
He said if anything
were to happen to him,

10:02.268 --> 10:04.019
I should give it to you
when you were ready.

10:04.520 --> 10:05.937
Whatever that means.

10:07.273 --> 10:08.398
It...

10:08.941 --> 10:10.025
It can't be.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.610
It's The Shepherd's Journal.

10:11.902 --> 10:14.696
Mr. Whitmore, this journal is the key

10:14.739 --> 10:16.906
to finding the lost continent of Atlantis!

10:16.991 --> 10:18.825
Atlantis.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.035
I wasn't born yesterday, son.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.494
No, no, no. Look. Look at this.

10:21.537 --> 10:23.872
Coordinates. Clues. It's all right here.

10:23.914 --> 10:25.540
Yeah, looks like gibberish to me.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.418
That's because it's been written
in a dialect that no longer exists.

10:28.502 --> 10:30.837
- So it's useless.
- No, no, just difficult.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.881
I've spent my whole life
studying dead languages.

10:32.965 --> 10:34.215
It's not gibberish to me.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.009
Ah, it's probably a fake.

10:37.261 --> 10:38.970
Mr. Whitmore,
my grandfather would have known

10:39.055 --> 10:41.222
if this were a fake. I would know.

10:41.265 --> 10:44.309
I will stake everything I own,
everything that I believe in,

10:44.393 --> 10:46.478
that this is
the genuine Shepherd's Journal.

10:46.562 --> 10:48.563
All right, all right.
So, what do you want to do with it?

10:48.606 --> 10:50.148
Well, I'll get funding.

10:50.232 --> 10:52.734
- I mean, I'll... The museum...
- They'll never believe you.

10:52.818 --> 10:55.570
I'll show them! I will make them believe.

10:55.613 --> 10:56.696
Like you did today?

10:56.739 --> 10:59.240
Yes! Well, no. How did you...

10:59.325 --> 11:00.992
Forget about them, okay? Never mind!

11:01.118 --> 11:02.869
I will find Atlantis on my own.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.621
I mean, if I have to rent a rowboat!

11:05.748 --> 11:07.290
Congratulations, Milo.

11:07.375 --> 11:10.085
This is exactly what I wanted to hear.

11:10.127 --> 11:11.670
But forget the rowboat, son.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.882
We'll travel in style.

11:18.344 --> 11:21.096
It's all been arranged,
the whole ball of wax.

11:21.180 --> 11:22.305
Why?

11:22.390 --> 11:24.140
For years, your granddad bent my ear

11:24.225 --> 11:25.684
with stories about that old book.

11:25.768 --> 11:26.976
I didn't buy it for a minute.

11:27.061 --> 11:29.562
So, finally, I got fed up
and I made a bet with the old coot.

11:29.605 --> 11:32.607
I said, "Thatch, if you ever
actually find that so-called journal,

11:32.650 --> 11:34.275
"not only will I finance the expedition,

11:34.318 --> 11:36.027
"but I'll kiss you full on the mouth."

11:36.112 --> 11:38.446
Imagine my embarrassment
when he found the darn thing.

11:39.323 --> 11:41.282
Now, I know
your grandfather's gone, Milo,

11:41.325 --> 11:42.575
God rest his soul,

11:42.618 --> 11:44.703
but Preston Whitmore
is a man who keeps his word.

11:44.787 --> 11:45.829
You hear that, Thatch?

11:45.913 --> 11:49.457
I'm going to the afterlife
with a clear conscience, by thunder!

11:56.966 --> 11:59.175
Your grandpa was a great man.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.386
You probably don't realize how great.

12:01.470 --> 12:04.973
Those buffoons at the museum
dragged him down,

12:05.057 --> 12:06.641
made a laughing stock of him.

12:07.643 --> 12:09.310
He died a broken man.

12:09.645 --> 12:13.148
If I could bring back
just one shred of proof,

12:13.232 --> 12:14.441
that'd be enough for me.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.318
Ah, Thatch.

12:18.487 --> 12:20.822
What are we standing around for?
We got work to do.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.407
But, Mr. Whitmore,
you know, in order to do

12:22.491 --> 12:24.075
what you're proposing,
you're gonna need a crew.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.160
Taken care of.

12:25.202 --> 12:27.120
You'll need engineers and geologists.

12:27.163 --> 12:29.122
Got 'em all. The best of the best.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.624
Gaetan Moliere,
geology and excavation.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.168
The man has a nose for dirt.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.086
Vincenzo Santorini, demolitions.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.046
Busted him out of a Turkish prison.

12:37.131 --> 12:39.048
Audrey Ramirez.
Don't let her age fool you.

12:39.133 --> 12:41.760
She's forgotten more about engines
than you and I will ever know.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.553
They're the same crew that
brought the Journal back.

12:43.637 --> 12:46.181
- Where was it?
- Iceland.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.224
I knew it! I knew it!

12:48.309 --> 12:51.311
All we need now is
an expert in gibberish.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.354
So, it's decision time.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.523
You can build on
the foundation your grandfather left you

12:55.566 --> 12:57.358
or you can go back to your boiler room.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.697
- This is for real.
- Now you're catching on.

13:02.740 --> 13:05.742
All right. Okay. I'll have to quit my job.

13:05.826 --> 13:07.410
It's done. You resigned this afternoon.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.287
- I did?
- Yep. Don't like to leave loose ends.

13:09.371 --> 13:11.039
My apartment.
I'm gonna have to give notice.

13:11.123 --> 13:12.624
- Taken care of.
- My clothes?

13:12.708 --> 13:13.875
- Packed.
- My books?

13:13.959 --> 13:15.418
- In storage.
- My cat?

13:17.296 --> 13:18.379
My gosh.

13:18.714 --> 13:20.507
Your granddad had a saying.

13:20.549 --> 13:23.885
"Our lives are remembered,
by the gifts we leave our children."

13:24.970 --> 13:27.222
This journal is his gift to you, Milo.

13:28.682 --> 13:30.433
Atlantis is waiting.

13:31.227 --> 13:32.310
What do you say?

13:32.394 --> 13:34.270
I'm your man, Mr. Whitmore.

13:34.355 --> 13:35.772
You will not regret this.

13:36.023 --> 13:37.190
Boy, I am so excited,

13:37.233 --> 13:39.400
I can't even hold it in.

13:46.909 --> 13:49.077
Carrots. Why is there always carrots?

13:49.119 --> 13:50.829
I didn't even eat carrots.

13:50.913 --> 13:53.748
Attention. All hands to the launch bay.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.584
To whoever took the "L"
from the Motor Pool sign,

13:56.627 --> 13:59.003
ha-ha, we are all very amused.

13:59.505 --> 14:02.423
Excuse me? I need to report in?

14:02.508 --> 14:03.758
Yes, Mr. Thatch?

14:03.801 --> 14:05.343
It's you!

14:05.427 --> 14:07.262
Blondie, I got a bone to pick with you.

14:07.346 --> 14:08.388
Hold that thought.

14:08.556 --> 14:09.973
What is it this time, Cookie?

14:10.099 --> 14:13.601
You done stuffed my wagon full to
busting with non-essentials.

14:13.644 --> 14:15.103
Look at all this.

14:15.145 --> 14:18.106
Cinnamon, oregano, cilantro.

14:18.148 --> 14:20.567
What in the cockadoodle is cilantro?

14:20.609 --> 14:22.735
And what is this?

14:22.778 --> 14:23.862
That would be lettuce.

14:23.946 --> 14:26.030
Lettuce? Lettuce?

14:26.115 --> 14:27.740
It's a vegetable, Cookie.

14:27.783 --> 14:29.784
The men need
the four basic food groups.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.953
I got your four basic food groups!

14:32.037 --> 14:33.830
Beans, bacon, whiskey, and lard!

14:35.040 --> 14:37.333
All right, cowboy.
Pack it up and move it out.

14:37.543 --> 14:40.795
Attention. All hands to the launch bay.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.172
Final loading in progress.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.100
Hey, Junior.

14:54.143 --> 14:57.020
If you're looking for the pony rides,
they're back there.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.147
Excuse me. Excuse me?

14:59.189 --> 15:01.566
You dropped your dynamite.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.153
What else have you got in there?

15:05.195 --> 15:10.325
Oh, gunpowder,
nitroglycerin, notepads,

15:10.367 --> 15:13.494
fuses, wicks, glue, and...

15:13.537 --> 15:15.330
Paper clips. Big ones.

15:15.539 --> 15:17.916
You know, just office supplies.

15:18.334 --> 15:19.626
Milo! Where you been?

15:19.668 --> 15:20.919
I want you to meet Commander Rourke.

15:21.003 --> 15:23.087
He led the Iceland team
that brought the Journal back.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.631
Milo Thatch.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.383
Pleasure to meet the grandson
of old Thaddeus.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.385
I see you got that journal. Nice pictures,

15:29.470 --> 15:31.930
but I prefer a good western myself.

15:32.014 --> 15:33.181
Pretty impressive, eh?

15:33.265 --> 15:36.643
Boy, when you settle a bet,
you settle a bet.

15:36.685 --> 15:38.269
Well, your granddad always believed

15:38.354 --> 15:40.605
you couldn't put a price
on the pursuit of knowledge.

15:40.689 --> 15:43.191
Well, believe me,
this'll be small change

15:43.275 --> 15:45.360
compared to the value
of what we're gonna learn on this trip.

15:45.444 --> 15:47.820
Yes, this should be
enriching for all of us.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.739
Attention, all personnel.

15:49.865 --> 15:52.533
Launch will commence in 15 minutes.

15:52.576 --> 15:53.826
- Mr. Whitmore.
- Rourke.

15:53.869 --> 15:54.869
It's time.

15:54.995 --> 15:57.497
- Bye, Mr. Whitmore!
- Make us proud, boy!

15:58.207 --> 15:59.540
Rig ship for dive!

15:59.583 --> 16:00.959
Aye, sir! Rig ship for dive.

16:01.043 --> 16:02.585
Lieutenant, take her down.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.295
Diving officer, submerge the ship.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.214
- Aye!
- Make the depth one-five-zero feet.

16:06.298 --> 16:08.216
Make the depth one-five-zero feet.

16:08.258 --> 16:10.551
Dive, dive! Five degrees down bubble.

16:10.594 --> 16:12.428
- Take us down.
- Take us down!

16:54.805 --> 16:55.805
Attention.

16:55.931 --> 16:58.266
Tonight's supper will be baked beans.

16:58.308 --> 17:00.018
Musical program to follow.

17:01.437 --> 17:02.478
Who wrote this?

17:09.236 --> 17:12.530
You have disturbed the dirt.

17:12.614 --> 17:14.949
- Pardon me?
- You have disturbed the dirt!

17:15.034 --> 17:17.242
Dirt from around the globe,
spanning the centuries!

17:17.286 --> 17:18.618
What have you done?

17:18.704 --> 17:21.039
England must never merge with France!

17:21.123 --> 17:23.290
- What's it doing in my bed?
- You ask too many questions.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.751
Who are you? Who sent you?
Speak up!

17:24.792 --> 17:27.295
- Me? I'm...
- I will know soon enough.

17:27.378 --> 17:28.713
Hey, hey, hey! Let go!

17:28.797 --> 17:30.590
Do not be such a crybaby. Hold still.

17:30.632 --> 17:32.467
A-ha! There you are.

17:32.509 --> 17:35.636
Now, tell me your story, my little friend.

17:35.721 --> 17:38.014
Parchment fiber from
the Nile delta circa 500 B.C.

17:38.098 --> 17:39.140
Lead pencil, number 2.

17:39.183 --> 17:40.641
Paint flecks of a type
used in government buildings.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.226
You have a cat,
shorthaired Persian, two years old,

17:42.311 --> 17:43.478
third in a litter of seven.

17:43.979 --> 17:47.482
There are all the microscopic
fingerprints of the mapmaker.

17:48.817 --> 17:50.485
And linguist.

17:50.819 --> 17:52.612
- Hey, how did you...
- This is an outrage!

17:52.654 --> 17:54.864
You must leave at once!
Out, out, out, out, out!

17:55.824 --> 17:57.408
Sat in the dirt, didn't you?

17:57.743 --> 17:59.327
Moliere, now what have I told you

17:59.369 --> 18:00.745
about playing nice with the other kids?

18:00.829 --> 18:03.289
Get back. I've got soap,
and I'm not afraid to use it.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.626
Back, foul creature!
Back to the pit from which you came!

18:08.045 --> 18:09.045
The name's Sweet.

18:09.129 --> 18:10.713
Joshua Sweet. Medical officer.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.006
Yeah, Milo Thatch.

18:12.049 --> 18:13.966
Milo Thatch. You're my 3:00.

18:14.009 --> 18:15.510
Well, no time like the present.

18:15.677 --> 18:16.969
- Oh, boy.
- Nice, isn't it?

18:17.012 --> 18:18.513
The catalog says that this little beauty

18:18.597 --> 18:20.181
can saw through a femur in 28 seconds.

18:20.265 --> 18:21.808
I'm betting I can cut that time in half.

18:21.850 --> 18:23.351
Now, stick out your
tongue and say, "Ah."

18:23.393 --> 18:24.852
Oh, no, really. I have a...

18:24.895 --> 18:26.020
So, where you from?

18:26.063 --> 18:27.438
Really? I have family up that way.

18:27.523 --> 18:29.357
Beautiful country up there.
Do you do any fishing?

18:30.818 --> 18:32.401
Me? I hate fishing. I hate fish.

18:32.486 --> 18:34.904
Hate the taste, hate the smell,
and hate all them little bones.

18:34.988 --> 18:36.948
Here, I'm gonna need you
to fill these up.

18:37.032 --> 18:38.366
With what?

18:38.408 --> 18:41.035
Will Milo Thatch
please report to the bridge?

18:41.120 --> 18:42.161
Thank you.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.913
I mean, nice meeting you.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.874
Nice meeting you, too.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.297
So I says to him,
"What's wrong with my meatloaf?"

18:53.382 --> 18:54.757
And he says to me...

18:54.842 --> 18:57.885
Hold on a second, Margie,
I got another call.

18:57.928 --> 19:00.221
Sir, we're approaching coordinates.

19:00.305 --> 19:02.223
Hello, Margie?
Yeah, so anyways, he says...

19:02.307 --> 19:04.016
All right, let's have a look around.

19:04.059 --> 19:05.560
Aye, sir. Set course to two-four-zero.

19:05.644 --> 19:06.686
Aye, aye, sir.

19:06.728 --> 19:07.979
15 degrees down angle
on the bow planes.

19:08.063 --> 19:09.814
Come right two-four-zero.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.942
Welcome to the bridge, Mr. Thatch.

19:13.026 --> 19:14.193
Okay, everybody,

19:14.236 --> 19:15.736
I want you to give Mr. Thatch

19:15.821 --> 19:17.405
your undivided attention.

19:17.948 --> 19:20.741
Good afternoon.
Can everyone hear me okay?

19:23.996 --> 19:26.914
Okay, how about some slides?

19:27.166 --> 19:29.667
The first slide is
a depiction of a creature.

19:29.751 --> 19:31.377
A creature so frightening

19:31.420 --> 19:34.881
that sailors were said
to be driven mad by the mere sight of it.

19:37.092 --> 19:39.552
I'm sorry. That's wrong.

19:39.595 --> 19:42.597
Geez, I used to take lunch money
from guys like this.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.098
Anyway, this... Okay.

19:44.141 --> 19:46.934
This is an illustration of the Leviathan,

19:46.977 --> 19:49.520
the creature guarding
the entrance to Atlantis.

19:49.605 --> 19:50.938
With something like that,

19:50.981 --> 19:53.357
I would have white wine, I think.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.109
It's a mythical sea serpent.

19:55.152 --> 19:56.527
He's described in The Book of Job.

19:56.612 --> 19:57.612
The Bible says,

19:57.696 --> 19:59.113
"Out of his mouth go burning lights,

19:59.198 --> 20:00.948
"sparks of fire shoot out."

20:00.991 --> 20:04.243
But more likely, it's a carving or
a sculpture to frighten the superstitious.

20:04.453 --> 20:06.746
So we find this masterpiece.
Then what?

20:06.788 --> 20:08.206
When do we dig?

20:08.290 --> 20:09.624
Actually, we don't have to dig.

20:09.666 --> 20:10.958
You see, according to the Journal,

20:11.001 --> 20:12.919
the path to Atlantis
will take us down a tunnel

20:12.961 --> 20:15.296
at the bottom of the ocean,
and we'll come up a curve

20:15.380 --> 20:16.964
into an air pocket right here,

20:17.007 --> 20:18.257
where we'll find the remnants

20:18.300 --> 20:20.509
of an ancient highway
that will lead us to Atlantis.

20:20.594 --> 20:22.011
Kind of like the grease trap in your sink.

20:22.262 --> 20:24.597
Cartographer, linguist, plumber.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.015
Hard to believe he's still single.

20:26.099 --> 20:28.643
- You said there'd be digging.
- Go away, Mole.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.353
Captain, you'd better
come look at this, sir.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.021
Okay, class dismissed.

20:32.189 --> 20:33.564
Give me exterior lights.

20:41.448 --> 20:42.990
Look at that.

20:43.033 --> 20:45.159
There are ships here from every era.

21:08.892 --> 21:11.435
Commander, I think
you should hear this.

21:12.896 --> 21:15.273
Commander? Commander?

21:15.983 --> 21:18.025
"Enter the lair of the Leviathan."

21:18.068 --> 21:19.318
Commander?

21:19.361 --> 21:20.903
"There you will find the path
to the gateway."

21:20.988 --> 21:23.364
- Commander?
- Yes, Mrs. Packard. What is it?

21:23.448 --> 21:25.533
I'm picking up something
on the hydrophone

21:25.617 --> 21:27.743
- I think you should hear.
- Put it on speakers.

21:37.254 --> 21:38.879
What is it? A pod of whales?

21:38.964 --> 21:40.423
Bigger.

21:40.507 --> 21:41.590
It sounds metallic.

21:41.675 --> 21:42.967
Could be an echo off one of the rocks.

21:43.051 --> 21:45.720
Do you want to do my job? Be my guest.

21:45.762 --> 21:47.596
Is it just me, or is that getting louder?

21:52.894 --> 21:55.062
Well, whatever it was, it's gone now.

21:55.105 --> 21:56.814
Helmsman! Bring us about.

21:56.898 --> 21:58.274
Tighten our search pattern
and slow us to...

22:01.445 --> 22:03.404
Out of the way!

22:11.455 --> 22:13.706
Tell Cookie to melt the butter
and break out the bibs.

22:13.749 --> 22:15.833
I want this lobster served up
on a silver platter.

22:15.917 --> 22:18.544
Load the torpedo bays!
Sub pod crews, battle stations!

22:19.755 --> 22:21.380
Battle stations!

22:22.090 --> 22:24.216
Steady, boys. Don't panic.

22:30.098 --> 22:32.767
Jiminy Christmas! It's a machine!

22:36.813 --> 22:38.606
Wait, wait!

22:40.067 --> 22:41.067
Launch subpods!

22:41.193 --> 22:42.568
Subpods away!

22:47.949 --> 22:49.033
Fire!

22:53.330 --> 22:54.663
We're free. All ahead full.

22:59.753 --> 23:02.171
Fire torpedoes!

23:14.851 --> 23:16.018
Get me the bridge!

23:16.269 --> 23:18.145
Sir, it's Engineering on four.

23:18.188 --> 23:20.314
Rourke! We took a big hit down here,

23:20.399 --> 23:21.982
and we're taking on water fast.

23:22.025 --> 23:24.110
I don't want to be around
when it hits the boilers.

23:24.152 --> 23:25.319
How much time do we have?

23:25.445 --> 23:26.987
Twenty minutes, if the bulkhead holds.

23:27.030 --> 23:29.323
You better make that five.

23:29.408 --> 23:30.908
You heard the lady. Let's move!

23:30.992 --> 23:32.493
Move! Where? Move where?

23:32.661 --> 23:33.702
Packard, sound the alarm!

23:33.829 --> 23:34.995
He took his suitcase?

23:35.080 --> 23:36.997
Marge, honey,
I don't think he's coming back.

23:37.207 --> 23:38.833
- Packard!
- I have to call you back.

23:38.875 --> 23:40.292
No, no, I'll call you.

23:42.295 --> 23:44.839
All hands, abandon ship.

23:45.006 --> 23:47.383
Move it, people!
Sometime today would be nice!

23:48.510 --> 23:50.469
Come on! Everybody
grab a seat and buckle in.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.388
Lieutenant, get us out of here!

23:56.101 --> 23:57.852
- Lieutenant!
- I'm working on it!

24:06.862 --> 24:07.903
Hang on.

24:19.499 --> 24:20.666
Where to, Mr. Thatch?

24:20.834 --> 24:23.127
We're looking for
a big crevice of some kind.

24:23.211 --> 24:24.420
There! Up ahead.

24:24.546 --> 24:26.755
All craft, make your mark
20 degrees down angle.

24:27.048 --> 24:28.924
Roger! 20 degrees down angle.

24:29.092 --> 24:30.217
Right behind you!

24:33.263 --> 24:35.681
- SacrÃ© bleu!
- We're getting killed out here!

24:46.026 --> 24:47.151
Look out!

24:50.572 --> 24:52.072
It's only a grease trap.
It's just like a sink.

24:52.115 --> 24:53.991
It's only a grease trap.
It's just like a sink!

25:50.799 --> 25:53.300
Seven hours ago,
we started this expedition

25:53.385 --> 25:56.595
with 200 of the finest men and women
I've ever known.

25:57.764 --> 25:59.056
We're all that's left.

25:59.599 --> 26:01.350
I won't sugarcoat it, gentlemen.

26:01.434 --> 26:03.394
We have a crisis on our hands.

26:03.937 --> 26:05.854
But we've been up
this particular creek before,

26:05.939 --> 26:08.607
and we've always come through,
paddle or no paddle.

26:08.650 --> 26:11.151
I see no reason
to change that policy now.

26:11.861 --> 26:14.280
From here on in,
everyone pulls double duty.

26:14.781 --> 26:16.657
Everyone drives, everyone works.

26:17.701 --> 26:20.953
Looks like all our chances for survival
rest with you, Mr. Thatch.

26:21.454 --> 26:22.997
You and that little book.

26:23.415 --> 26:24.832
We're all gonna die.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.834
Okay, people. Saddle up.

26:26.918 --> 26:29.712
Lieutenant, I want this convoy
moving five minutes ago.

26:29.796 --> 26:30.879
Moliere, you're on point.

26:30.964 --> 26:32.881
No, Vinny, Audrey's taking the oiler.

26:32.966 --> 26:34.341
You know the rules. I want you 50 yards

26:34.426 --> 26:36.135
behind that truck at all times.

26:36.177 --> 26:38.220
And, Packard, put out that cigarette.

26:46.354 --> 26:48.731
Are you sure you're checked out
on this class of vehicle?

26:49.649 --> 26:51.233
Can you drive a truck?

26:52.694 --> 26:54.403
Of course I can drive a truck.

26:54.487 --> 26:56.363
I mean, sure, you got your steering,

26:56.448 --> 26:57.823
and your gas, and your brake,

26:57.866 --> 27:02.536
and of course, this metal-looking thing.

27:03.830 --> 27:05.706
Okay, so it was a bumper car
at Coney Island,

27:05.749 --> 27:07.124
but it's the same basic principle!

27:12.464 --> 27:14.673
Come on! Move it!

27:15.383 --> 27:16.675
Sorry about... Sorry about that.

27:16.718 --> 27:18.093
Come on, civilian!

28:16.111 --> 28:17.528
You didn't just drink that, did you?

28:17.612 --> 28:18.654
That's not good.

28:18.738 --> 28:19.905
That's nitroglycerin.

28:19.948 --> 28:21.031
Don't move.

28:21.116 --> 28:22.783
Don't breathe.

28:22.826 --> 28:25.786
Don't do anything, except pray, maybe.

28:25.870 --> 28:27.246
Boom!

28:48.059 --> 28:49.810
Yeah.

29:03.575 --> 29:05.993
Good night!
Will you look at the size of this?

29:06.035 --> 29:08.078
It's gotta be half a mile high, at least.

29:08.163 --> 29:09.747
It must have taken hundred...

29:09.831 --> 29:12.666
No, thousands of years
to carve this thing.

29:17.464 --> 29:19.339
Hey, look, I made a bridge.

29:19.424 --> 29:20.883
It only took me, like, what?

29:20.967 --> 29:23.010
10 seconds, 11, tops.

29:41.821 --> 29:43.697
Looks like we have a little roadblock.

29:44.032 --> 29:45.199
Vinny, what do you think?

29:45.283 --> 29:48.744
I could un-roadblock that
if I had about 200 of these.

29:48.828 --> 29:51.789
Problem is, I only got about 10.

29:52.165 --> 29:54.208
Plus, you know, five of my own,

29:54.250 --> 29:58.128
and a couple of cherry bombs,
a road flare.

29:58.630 --> 30:01.882
Hey, too bad we don't have
some nitroglycerin, eh, Milo?

30:03.927 --> 30:05.552
Looks like we're gonna have to dig.

30:06.888 --> 30:08.931
It will be my pleasure.

30:22.070 --> 30:23.195
Stupid...

30:23.780 --> 30:25.072
Stupid!

30:25.615 --> 30:26.865
I don't understand it.

30:27.075 --> 30:28.784
I just tuned this thing up this morning.

30:28.868 --> 30:31.119
It looks like the rotor's shot!

30:31.871 --> 30:33.747
I'm gonna have to pull
a spare from one of the trucks.

30:33.790 --> 30:35.707
- Can I...
- No toques nada!

30:35.750 --> 30:36.917
I'll be right back.

30:45.176 --> 30:46.802
She lives!

30:47.095 --> 30:48.512
Hey, what'd you do?

30:48.596 --> 30:51.098
Well, you know, the boiler in this baby

30:51.140 --> 30:53.183
is a Humac model P-54 stroke 813.

30:53.268 --> 30:56.436
Now, we got the 814
back at the museum.

30:56.521 --> 30:58.730
The heating cores
on the whole Humac line

30:58.773 --> 31:00.774
have always been a little,
you know, temperamental,

31:00.859 --> 31:02.943
so sometimes you gotta... Boom!

31:02.986 --> 31:04.027
Persuade 'em a little.

31:04.112 --> 31:05.529
Yeah, yeah. Thank you very much.

31:05.613 --> 31:06.697
Shut up.

31:09.242 --> 31:10.409
Two for flinching.

31:18.293 --> 31:20.335
This is it. It's gotta be.

31:20.795 --> 31:22.921
All right, we'll make camp here.

31:23.256 --> 31:24.381
Why is it glowing?

31:24.465 --> 31:27.217
It is a natural phosphorescence.

31:27.468 --> 31:30.554
That thing is going to
keep me up all night, I know it.

31:30.638 --> 31:32.472
Come and get it!

31:33.057 --> 31:35.684
For the appetizer, Caesar salad,

31:36.311 --> 31:39.605
escargot, and your oriental spring rolls.

31:39.647 --> 31:41.565
- Yuck.
- I wanted the escargot.

31:41.649 --> 31:42.816
Knock yourself out.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.611
There you go, Milo.

31:45.653 --> 31:47.321
Put some meat on them bones.

31:47.363 --> 31:50.198
Thanks, Cookie.
That looks greasier than usual.

31:50.283 --> 31:52.367
You like it? Well, have some more.

31:52.452 --> 31:54.494
You're so skinny,
if you turned sideways

31:54.579 --> 31:56.330
and stuck out your tongue,
you'd look like a zipper.

31:56.789 --> 31:58.498
You know,
we've been pretty tough on the kid.

31:58.583 --> 31:59.958
What do you say
we cut him some slack?

32:00.168 --> 32:01.460
Yeah, you're right.

32:01.711 --> 32:03.712
Hey, Milo!
Why don't you come sit with us?

32:03.880 --> 32:05.881
Really? You don't mind?

32:06.007 --> 32:07.299
Nah. Park it here.

32:07.467 --> 32:09.009
Gee, this is great.

32:09.093 --> 32:10.928
I mean, you know,
it's an honor to be included in your...

32:15.642 --> 32:18.727
- Mole!
- Ah, forgive me.

32:19.395 --> 32:21.188
I could not resist.

32:21.272 --> 32:23.231
Hey, Milo,
don't you ever close that book?

32:23.524 --> 32:25.192
Yeah, you must've read it
a dozen times by now.

32:25.360 --> 32:28.028
I know, but this...
This doesn't make any sense.

32:28.404 --> 32:30.238
See, in this passage here, the shepherd

32:30.323 --> 32:31.573
seems to be leading up to something.

32:31.658 --> 32:33.283
He calls it the heart of Atlantis.

32:33.368 --> 32:36.078
It could be the power source
the legends refer to.

32:36.162 --> 32:38.455
But then, it just... It cuts off.

32:38.539 --> 32:40.040
It's almost like there's a missing page.

32:40.208 --> 32:41.750
Kid, relax.

32:41.834 --> 32:43.085
We don't get paid overtime.

32:43.169 --> 32:44.544
I know, I know.

32:44.629 --> 32:46.380
Sometimes I get a little carried away.

32:46.422 --> 32:48.715
But hey, you know,
that's what this is all about, right?

32:48.800 --> 32:51.385
I mean, discovery,
teamwork, adventure.

32:52.387 --> 32:54.429
Unless, maybe...

32:54.722 --> 32:56.515
You're just in it for the money.

32:57.517 --> 32:59.643
- Money.
- Money.

32:59.727 --> 33:01.561
I'm gonna say... Money.

33:01.854 --> 33:04.940
Well, I guess
I set myself up for that one.

33:05.525 --> 33:07.359
What, is something
wrong with your neck?

33:07.402 --> 33:09.361
Oh, yeah, I must've hurt it when...

33:10.697 --> 33:11.697
Better?

33:12.323 --> 33:13.573
Yeah!

33:13.616 --> 33:15.534
Hey, how'd you learn how to do that?

33:15.576 --> 33:17.577
- An Arapaho medicine man.
- Get outta here.

33:17.662 --> 33:19.913
Born and raised with 'em.
My father was an army medic.

33:20.164 --> 33:23.000
He settled down in the Kansas
Territory after he met my mother.

33:23.251 --> 33:24.459
- No kidding.
- Nope.

33:24.544 --> 33:26.294
I got a sheepskin from Howard U,

33:26.379 --> 33:28.422
and a bearskin from old Iron Cloud.

33:28.464 --> 33:30.298
Halfway through medical school,
I was drafted.

33:30.550 --> 33:32.884
One day I'm studying gross anatomy
in the classroom,

33:32.927 --> 33:35.387
the next, I'm sewing up Rough Riders
on San Juan Hill.

33:35.430 --> 33:36.596
Main course.

33:36.681 --> 33:37.973
I couldn't eat another bite.

33:38.057 --> 33:39.266
I'm watching my weight.

33:39.350 --> 33:40.767
Don't you worry.

33:40.852 --> 33:43.353
It'll keep and keep and keep.

33:44.272 --> 33:47.024
Thank God I lost my sense of taste
years ago.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.031
Aren't you going to pitch up your tent?

33:54.157 --> 33:55.699
I did.

33:57.368 --> 33:58.994
I guess I'm still a little rusty at this.

33:59.078 --> 34:00.871
I haven't gone camping since...

34:00.955 --> 34:02.456
Well, since the last time
my grandpa took me.

34:02.707 --> 34:04.374
I never got to meet your grandfather.

34:04.459 --> 34:05.584
What was he like?

34:05.668 --> 34:07.210
Where do you start?

34:07.295 --> 34:09.295
He was like a father to me, really.

34:09.338 --> 34:13.132
My parents died when I was
a little kid, and he took me in.

34:15.303 --> 34:16.803
What?

34:17.221 --> 34:18.722
Well, I was just thinking.

34:19.098 --> 34:20.474
One time, when I was eight,

34:20.516 --> 34:22.350
we were hiking along this stream,

34:22.435 --> 34:25.478
and I saw something
shining in the water.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.147
It was a genuine arrowhead.

34:27.774 --> 34:29.858
Well, you'd think I'd found
a lost civilization

34:29.942 --> 34:31.818
the way Grandpa carried on about it.

34:31.944 --> 34:34.154
It wasn't until I was older
that I realized that the arrowhead

34:34.237 --> 34:35.362
was just some compressed shale

34:35.447 --> 34:36.782
mixed with zinc pyrite that had fractured

34:36.824 --> 34:38.574
into an isosceletic triangulate.

34:38.659 --> 34:41.203
That is so cute!

34:41.913 --> 34:44.121
Say, Audrey, no offense,

34:44.165 --> 34:46.500
but how does a teenager
become the chief mechanic

34:46.542 --> 34:48.126
of a multimillion dollar expedition?

34:48.168 --> 34:50.295
Well, I took this job
when my dad retired.

34:50.338 --> 34:53.255
But the funny thing was
he always wanted sons, right?

34:53.341 --> 34:55.132
One to run his machine shop
and the other

34:55.176 --> 34:57.177
to be middleweight boxing champion.

34:57.261 --> 34:59.262
But he got my sister and me instead.

35:00.556 --> 35:02.265
So, what happened to your sister?

35:02.391 --> 35:04.893
She's 24-0 with a shot
at the title next month.

35:05.561 --> 35:07.062
Anyway, I'm saving up

35:07.146 --> 35:09.397
so my papi and I
can open another shop.

35:09.482 --> 35:11.108
Forget your jammies, Mrs. Packard?

35:11.275 --> 35:12.818
I sleep in the nude.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.653
You're gonna want a pair of these.

35:14.695 --> 35:16.029
She sleepwalks.

35:16.531 --> 35:18.281
Well, as far as me goes,

35:18.366 --> 35:20.242
I just like to blow things up.

35:20.326 --> 35:22.202
Come on, Vinny, tell the kid the truth.

35:24.372 --> 35:26.373
My family owned a flower shop.

35:26.415 --> 35:28.291
We would sell roses,

35:28.459 --> 35:31.336
carnations, baby's breath, you name it.

35:31.921 --> 35:33.171
One day, I'm making

35:33.214 --> 35:36.883
about three dozen corsages
for this prom.

35:36.926 --> 35:39.261
You know, the one
they put on their wrist.

35:39.345 --> 35:41.930
And everybody, they come.
"Where is it?"

35:42.014 --> 35:44.558
"When is it?"
"Does it match my dress?"

35:45.059 --> 35:46.560
It's a nightmare.

35:46.644 --> 35:49.980
Anyway, I guess
there was this leak next door

35:50.064 --> 35:52.023
of gas or what. Boom!

35:52.066 --> 35:53.441
No more Chinese laundry.

35:53.693 --> 35:55.861
Blew me right through the front window.

35:55.903 --> 35:58.363
It was like a sign from God.

35:58.573 --> 36:00.740
I found myself that boom.

36:06.038 --> 36:07.164
What's Mole's story?

36:07.248 --> 36:09.166
Trust me on this one.
You don't wanna know.

36:09.250 --> 36:12.002
Audrey, don't tell him. You shouldn't
have told me, but you did.

36:12.086 --> 36:14.421
And now, I'm telling you,
you don't wanna know.

36:45.244 --> 36:47.245
The redhead's got a gun.

37:05.389 --> 37:06.514
Holy...

37:13.064 --> 37:14.064
Fire.

37:17.151 --> 37:23.156
Fire!

37:23.241 --> 37:24.324
I'm gonna kill him.

37:24.408 --> 37:26.159
Thatch, go back to bed.

37:28.663 --> 37:29.955
Get some water on that fire!

37:29.997 --> 37:30.997
No time!

37:31.123 --> 37:32.374
Get us into those caves!

37:32.458 --> 37:33.625
Move it! Move it! Move it!

37:38.631 --> 37:40.674
Gertie, pull!

37:44.887 --> 37:46.972
Milo, jump! Right now!

38:09.662 --> 38:11.037
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

38:37.023 --> 38:39.441
All right, who's not dead? Sound off.

38:41.652 --> 38:45.071
Danged lightning bugs
done bit me on my sit upon.

38:45.114 --> 38:47.657
Somebody's gonna have to
suck out that poison.

38:47.742 --> 38:49.367
Now, don't everybody jump up at once.

38:50.745 --> 38:52.495
Audrey, give me a damage report.

38:52.580 --> 38:54.831
Not as bad as it could have been.

38:54.915 --> 38:56.458
We totaled rigs two and seven,

38:56.542 --> 38:58.835
but the digger looks like it'll still run.

38:59.378 --> 39:01.671
Lucky for us
we landed in something soft.

39:01.881 --> 39:03.590
Pumice ash.

39:03.632 --> 39:06.634
We are standing at the base
of a dormant volcano.

39:09.847 --> 39:11.139
It just keeps going.

39:11.515 --> 39:12.932
Maybe that's our ticket outta here.

39:13.851 --> 39:14.934
Maybe not.

39:15.144 --> 39:19.356
The magma has solidified
in the bowels of the volcano,

39:19.440 --> 39:21.191
effectively blocking the exit.

39:21.275 --> 39:23.985
I got the same problem with sauerkraut.

39:24.070 --> 39:25.612
Hold on. Back up.

39:25.696 --> 39:28.615
Are you saying this whole volcano
can blow at any time?

39:28.657 --> 39:29.908
No, no, no, no.

39:29.950 --> 39:33.953
That would take
an explosive force of great magnitude.

39:38.876 --> 39:40.627
Maybe I should do this later, huh?

39:41.045 --> 39:42.962
If we could blow the top off of that thing,

39:43.047 --> 39:45.131
we'd have a straight shot to the surface.

39:45.299 --> 39:46.966
Mr. Thatch, what do you think?

39:47.051 --> 39:48.134
Mr. Thatch?

39:49.011 --> 39:50.553
Thatch?

40:39.395 --> 40:40.687
Hey, wait!

40:43.691 --> 40:46.693
Who are you? Where are you going?

40:47.653 --> 40:48.778
Come back!

40:56.537 --> 40:58.037
Hey, wait a minute!

40:58.080 --> 40:59.664
Who are you?

41:26.817 --> 41:28.776
Sweet mother of Jefferson Davis!

41:28.861 --> 41:30.320
It's beautiful.

41:30.988 --> 41:32.572
Milo, I gotta hand it to you.

41:32.656 --> 41:33.907
You really came through.

41:37.578 --> 41:38.912
I take that back.

41:38.996 --> 41:41.164
Holy cats! Who are these guys?

41:41.248 --> 41:44.417
- They gotta be Atlanteans.
- What? That's impossible!

41:44.585 --> 41:46.669
I seen this back in the Dakota.

41:46.754 --> 41:49.506
They can smell fear
just by looking at ya.

41:49.590 --> 41:50.673
So, keep quiet.

41:58.015 --> 41:59.766
I think it's talking to you.

42:30.297 --> 42:31.631
Parlez-vous franÃ§ais?

42:31.715 --> 42:32.715
Oui, monsieur!

42:32.800 --> 42:34.133
They speak my language!

42:34.176 --> 42:35.385
Pardon, mademoiselle.

42:35.469 --> 42:37.762
Voulez-vous...

42:39.181 --> 42:40.348
I like her.

42:40.432 --> 42:42.267
'Bout time someone hit him.

42:42.309 --> 42:43.601
I'm just sorry it wasn't me.

42:46.647 --> 42:48.314
How do they know all these languages?

42:48.357 --> 42:51.150
Their language must be
based on a root dialect.

42:51.193 --> 42:52.819
It's just like the Tower of Babel.

42:52.861 --> 42:54.946
Well, maybe English
is in there somewhere.

42:55.447 --> 42:58.157
We are explorers
from the surface world.

42:58.742 --> 43:00.326
We come in peace.

43:00.578 --> 43:03.371
Welcome to the city of Atlantis.

43:04.039 --> 43:06.666
Come. You must speak
with my father now.

43:07.001 --> 43:09.669
Squad "B," head back
to the shaft and salvage what you can.

43:09.712 --> 43:11.963
- Yes, sir!
- We'll rendezvous in 24 hours.

43:12.047 --> 43:13.756
Let's move it. You heard him.

43:16.260 --> 43:18.011
I'm so excited!

43:30.024 --> 43:31.357
Now, what's really amazing is that

43:31.400 --> 43:32.900
if you deconstructed Latin,
you overlaid it

43:32.985 --> 43:35.069
with a little Sumerian,
throw in a dash of Thessalonian,

43:35.154 --> 43:37.155
you'd be getting close to
their basic grammatical structure.

43:37.197 --> 43:38.573
Or at least you'd be
in the same ballpark...

43:38.657 --> 43:41.993
- Someone's having a good time.
- Like a kid at Christmas.

43:43.037 --> 43:46.414
Commander, there were
not supposed to be people down here.

43:46.498 --> 43:47.707
This changes everything.

43:47.750 --> 43:49.542
This changes nothing.

43:50.252 --> 43:51.836
Take that, Mr. Harcourt!

44:50.771 --> 44:51.771
Your Majesty?

44:51.855 --> 44:53.106
On behalf of my crew,

44:53.148 --> 44:56.025
may I say it is an honor
to be welcomed to your city.

44:56.110 --> 44:57.652
Excuse me? Commander?

44:57.736 --> 45:01.155
You presume much
to think you are welcome here.

45:01.782 --> 45:04.200
Oh, sir, we have come
a long way looking for...

45:04.284 --> 45:08.579
I know what you seek,
and you will not find it here.

45:09.206 --> 45:10.998
Your journey has been in vain.

45:11.333 --> 45:14.293
But we are peaceful explorers,
men of science.

45:16.338 --> 45:18.631
And yet you bring weapons.

45:18.716 --> 45:22.969
Our weapons allow us to remove
obstacles we may encounter.

45:23.137 --> 45:27.890
Some obstacles cannot be
removed with a mere show of force.

45:28.392 --> 45:32.854
Return to your people.
You must leave Atlantis at once.

45:33.230 --> 45:35.314
Oh, Your Majesty, be reasonable.

45:35.399 --> 45:37.150
- Sir...
- Not now, son.

45:37.443 --> 45:39.819
Trust me on this.
We better do as he says.

45:41.280 --> 45:45.700
May I respectfully request
that we stay one night, sir?

45:45.784 --> 45:48.619
That would give us
time to rest, resupply,

45:48.662 --> 45:50.246
and be ready to travel by morning.

45:51.999 --> 45:54.083
Very well. One night.

45:55.002 --> 45:56.210
That is all.

45:56.378 --> 45:58.379
Well, thank you, Your Majesty.

46:05.721 --> 46:08.389
Your heart has softened, Kida.

46:08.474 --> 46:11.684
A thousand years ago,
you would have slain them on sight.

46:11.727 --> 46:14.228
A thousand years ago,
the streets were lit,

46:14.354 --> 46:17.148
and our people did not
have to scavenge for food

46:17.191 --> 46:18.608
at the edge of a crumbling city!

46:18.692 --> 46:20.193
The people are content.

46:20.277 --> 46:22.195
They do not know any better!

46:22.237 --> 46:24.906
We were once a great people.
Now we live in ruins.

46:25.532 --> 46:27.700
The kings of our past would weep

46:27.785 --> 46:29.535
if they could see how far we have fallen.

46:29.703 --> 46:32.163
- Kida.
- If these outsiders

46:32.206 --> 46:35.208
can unlock the secrets of our past,

46:35.292 --> 46:37.210
perhaps we can save our future.

46:37.503 --> 46:42.131
What they have to teach us
we have already learned.

46:42.341 --> 46:44.717
Our way of life is dying.

46:45.427 --> 46:47.386
Our way of life is preserved.

46:47.429 --> 46:53.059
Kida, when you take the throne,
you will understand.

46:56.313 --> 46:57.730
- So, how'd it go?
- Well,

46:57.815 --> 47:00.483
the King and his daughter
don't exactly see eye to eye.

47:00.567 --> 47:02.860
She seems to like us okay,
but the King...

47:02.903 --> 47:04.403
I don't know. I think
he's hiding something.

47:04.655 --> 47:08.074
Well, if he's hiding something,
I want to know what it is.

47:08.158 --> 47:10.535
- Someone needs to talk to that girl.
- I will go!

47:10.619 --> 47:13.412
- Someone with good people skills.
- I will do it!

47:13.455 --> 47:15.623
- Someone who won't scare her away.
- I volunteer!

47:15.707 --> 47:17.667
Someone who can speak the language.

47:17.751 --> 47:19.669
For the good of the mission, I will go!

47:19.753 --> 47:22.463
Good man, Thatch.
Thanks for volunteering.

47:25.843 --> 47:27.260
Go get 'em, tiger.

47:33.976 --> 47:35.768
Okay, Milo, don't take no for an answer.

47:35.853 --> 47:37.019
"Look, I have some questions for you,

47:37.104 --> 47:39.480
"and I'm not leaving this city
until they're answered!" Yeah, that's it.

47:39.565 --> 47:40.982
That's good, that's good.

47:46.989 --> 47:48.614
I have some questions for you,

47:48.699 --> 47:51.659
and you are not leaving this city
until they are answered.

47:51.994 --> 47:54.704
- Yeah, well, I... Okay.
- Come with me.

48:01.962 --> 48:05.548
Oh, there is so much
to ask about your world.

48:06.133 --> 48:08.175
You are a scholar, are you not?

48:08.260 --> 48:10.970
Judging from your diminished
physique and large forehead,

48:11.054 --> 48:12.638
you are suited for nothing else.

48:12.681 --> 48:14.265
What is your country of origin?

48:14.308 --> 48:15.975
When did the flood waters recede?

48:16.059 --> 48:17.101
- How did you...
- Wait a minute.

48:17.144 --> 48:18.603
I got a few questions for you, too.

48:18.645 --> 48:20.646
So let's do this, okay?
You ask one, then I'll ask one,

48:20.731 --> 48:23.232
then you, then me, then...
Well, you get it.

48:23.317 --> 48:26.193
Very well. What is your first question?

48:26.278 --> 48:28.654
Well, okay, how did you get here?

48:28.697 --> 48:31.157
Well, I mean, not you, personally,
but your culture.

48:31.199 --> 48:33.826
I mean, how did all of this
end up down here?

48:33.911 --> 48:37.079
It is said that
the gods became jealous of Atlantis.

48:37.164 --> 48:40.249
They sent a great cataclysm
and banished us here.

48:40.334 --> 48:43.002
All I can remember is the sky going dark

48:43.045 --> 48:46.172
and people shouting and running.

48:46.506 --> 48:50.217
Then, a bright light, like a star

48:50.302 --> 48:51.761
floating above the city.

48:52.346 --> 48:54.972
My father said it called my mother to it.

48:55.849 --> 48:57.183
I never saw her again.

48:57.225 --> 48:59.685
I'm sorry. If it's any consolation,

48:59.770 --> 49:01.729
I know how you feel, because I lost my...

49:01.813 --> 49:04.357
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!
Whoa, back up!

49:04.441 --> 49:05.983
What are you telling me?

49:06.026 --> 49:07.902
That you remember
because you were there?

49:07.986 --> 49:09.320
No, that's... That's impossible...

49:09.363 --> 49:11.280
Because, I mean,
that would make you...

49:11.365 --> 49:15.076
You know, 8,500-8,800 years old.

49:15.202 --> 49:16.202
Yes.

49:17.371 --> 49:20.873
Oh, well. Hey. Looking good.

49:20.958 --> 49:23.167
Just...

49:23.210 --> 49:25.002
- You got another question for me?
- Yes.

49:25.045 --> 49:27.713
How is it you found
your way to this place?

49:27.756 --> 49:29.131
Well, I'll tell you, it wasn't easy.

49:29.216 --> 49:31.425
If it weren't for this book,
we never would have made it.

49:33.011 --> 49:35.429
Okay, second question. Legend has it
that your people possessed

49:35.514 --> 49:37.556
a power source of some kind
that enabled them...

49:37.599 --> 49:40.476
- You mean you can understand this?
- Yes, I'm a linguist.

49:40.560 --> 49:41.686
That's what I do, that's my job.

49:41.728 --> 49:44.271
- Now, getting back to my question...
- This, right here,

49:44.356 --> 49:45.439
you can read this?

49:45.524 --> 49:48.067
Yes, yes.
I can read Atlantean, just like you.

49:49.903 --> 49:52.238
You can't, can you?

49:52.364 --> 49:53.406
No one can.

49:53.490 --> 49:54.865
Such knowledge has been lost to us

49:54.908 --> 49:56.450
since the time of the mehbehlmoak.

49:56.535 --> 49:58.202
Oh, the Great Flood.

49:58.996 --> 50:00.913
- Show me.
- Okay...

50:03.750 --> 50:06.544
"Follow the narrow passage
for another league.

50:06.586 --> 50:09.088
"There, you will find the fifth marker."

50:09.131 --> 50:11.632
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.
How was my accent?

50:11.717 --> 50:13.342
Boorish, provincial...

50:13.427 --> 50:16.512
- And you speak it through your nose.
- Yeah, gotta work on that.

50:16.596 --> 50:18.556
Here, let me show you something.

50:22.310 --> 50:25.563
What? It looks like some sort of vehicle.

50:25.605 --> 50:29.442
Yes. But no matter what I try,
it will not respond.

50:29.526 --> 50:31.068
- Perhaps if...
- Way ahead of you.

50:31.111 --> 50:32.987
Okay, let's see what we got here.

50:33.405 --> 50:36.532
Okay. "Place crystal into slot."

50:36.616 --> 50:37.825
Yes, yes, I have done that!

50:37.909 --> 50:40.494
"Gently place your hand
on the inscription pad."

50:40.579 --> 50:41.954
- Yes!
- Okay, did you turn the crystal

50:42.039 --> 50:43.748
- one-quarter turn back?
- Yes. Yes!

50:43.790 --> 50:46.083
While your hand was
on the inscription pad?

50:46.126 --> 50:47.209
No.

50:47.294 --> 50:50.379
Ah, well. See, there's
your problem right there.

50:50.464 --> 50:52.214
That's an easy thing to miss.
You know, you deserve credit

50:52.299 --> 50:54.175
for even getting this far.

50:55.510 --> 50:56.844
Okay, give it a try.

51:06.271 --> 51:07.563
Yeah, you got that right.

51:08.106 --> 51:10.858
This is great! With this thing,

51:10.942 --> 51:13.152
I could see the whole city
in no time at all.

51:13.236 --> 51:14.528
Wonder how fast it goes.

51:23.288 --> 51:25.664
So, who's hungry?

51:26.917 --> 51:29.502
By the way, we were never
properly introduced.

51:29.795 --> 51:30.920
My name's Milo.

51:31.004 --> 51:33.005
My name is Kidagakash.

51:33.090 --> 51:35.174
Kidamaschnaga.

51:35.217 --> 51:37.343
Hey, you got a nickname?

51:37.511 --> 51:39.053
Kida.

51:39.137 --> 51:42.348
Okay, Kida. I can remember that.

51:45.602 --> 51:46.685
Wow.

52:05.705 --> 52:06.831
What is wrong?

52:06.873 --> 52:10.334
Oh, it's nothing. I just...
Got something in my eye.

52:10.877 --> 52:12.586
You know, my grandpa
used to tell me stories

52:12.671 --> 52:15.131
about this place
as far back as I can remember.

52:16.174 --> 52:18.217
I just wish he could be
standing here with me.

52:36.403 --> 52:38.279
Tell me more about your companions.

52:38.363 --> 52:40.698
Your physician, he is called Cookie?

52:40.740 --> 52:41.949
- No, that's Sweet.
- What is?

52:42.033 --> 52:43.242
The doctor. He's Sweet.

52:43.285 --> 52:44.660
Oh, he is kindly.

52:44.995 --> 52:46.495
No, no, no, that's... That's his name.

52:46.580 --> 52:48.372
- His name is Kindly?
- No, Sweet.

52:48.415 --> 52:50.082
Well, I mean, he's kindly, too.

52:50.292 --> 52:53.794
So all of your doctors
are sweet and kindly?

52:53.879 --> 52:56.422
No. Well, I'm sure some are.

52:56.464 --> 52:58.799
Ours is, but that's not a requirement.

52:58.884 --> 53:01.135
- You're missing the point.
- You are confusing me.

53:01.219 --> 53:04.263
Wow. Look at all those tattoos.

53:04.347 --> 53:05.931
Shoot. That ain't nothing.

53:05.974 --> 53:07.141
Look here what I got.

53:07.225 --> 53:09.810
All 38 United States.

53:09.895 --> 53:11.854
Watch me make Rhode Island dance.

53:11.938 --> 53:13.772
Go on, baby, dance. Dance.

53:13.857 --> 53:15.858
There you go.

53:28.788 --> 53:31.290
Cookies are sweet, but yours is not.

53:31.333 --> 53:33.959
Sweet is kindly,
but that is not his name.

53:34.002 --> 53:38.130
Audrey is sweet,
but she is not your doctor.

53:38.173 --> 53:41.926
And the little digging animal
called Mole...

53:41.968 --> 53:43.427
He is your pet?

53:43.470 --> 53:44.553
Close enough.

53:47.265 --> 53:49.099
Oh, don't forget to eat the head.

53:49.142 --> 53:50.476
That's where all the nutrients are.

54:10.997 --> 54:12.957
You know, Kida,
the most we ever hoped to find

54:12.999 --> 54:15.668
was some crumbling buildings,
maybe some broken pottery.

54:16.336 --> 54:19.672
Instead, we find a living,
thriving society.

54:20.090 --> 54:21.757
These guys are kinda cute

54:21.841 --> 54:24.843
when they're not, you know,
formed into a fiery column of death.

54:25.512 --> 54:26.845
We are not thriving.

54:26.888 --> 54:30.182
True, our people live,
but our culture is dying.

54:30.934 --> 54:33.644
We are like a stone
the ocean beats against.

54:33.687 --> 54:36.689
With each passing year,
a little more of us is worn away.

54:37.482 --> 54:39.066
I wish there was something I could do.

54:39.359 --> 54:42.486
I have brought you to this place
to ask you for your help.

54:43.029 --> 54:46.657
There is a mural here
with writing all around the pictures.

54:46.700 --> 54:48.867
Yeah, well, you came to the right guy.

54:48.910 --> 54:51.620
Okay, let me see.
Let's start with this column right here.

54:51.705 --> 54:55.624
Well, this... Kida?

54:58.712 --> 55:01.547
- What are you doing?
- You do swim, do you not?

55:01.631 --> 55:03.048
Oh, I swim, pretty girl.

55:03.133 --> 55:04.383
Pretty good! Pretty good.

55:04.467 --> 55:07.052
Good, swim good.
Pretty good. I swim pretty good.

55:07.470 --> 55:10.556
Good. It is a fair distance
to where we are going.

55:10.682 --> 55:13.559
Hey, you are talking
to the belly flop champ

55:13.601 --> 55:15.477
at Camp Runamuck.

55:17.188 --> 55:19.231
Come on, we're wasting time.

55:22.068 --> 55:25.446
Why don't you lead the way, because

55:25.530 --> 55:27.323
I have no idea where we're going.

55:46.468 --> 55:49.511
- Are you all right?
- Well, I didn't drown, so...

55:49.596 --> 55:50.929
Good. Follow me.

56:06.654 --> 56:07.946
This is amazing!

56:08.031 --> 56:09.615
A complete history of Atlantis!

56:09.699 --> 56:11.450
It's just like Plato described it.

56:11.534 --> 56:14.620
Well, he was off on a few details, but...

56:14.704 --> 56:15.996
The light I saw.

56:16.081 --> 56:18.123
The star in the middle of the city.

56:18.166 --> 56:20.292
What does the writing say about that?

56:20.335 --> 56:21.668
I don't know yet.

56:21.753 --> 56:23.629
But we're gonna find out.

56:23.713 --> 56:24.797
Come on.

57:04.170 --> 57:05.754
- The heart of Atlantis!
- What?

57:05.839 --> 57:08.966
It's the heart of Atlantis! That's
what the shepherd was talking about.

57:09.008 --> 57:11.051
It wasn't a star, it was...
It was some kind of crystal.

57:11.136 --> 57:13.846
Like these! Don't you get it?

57:14.264 --> 57:16.348
The power source I've been looking for,

57:16.433 --> 57:18.016
the bright light you remember.

57:18.059 --> 57:20.352
- They're the same thing!
- That cannot be.

57:20.395 --> 57:22.438
It's what's keeping all these things...

57:22.522 --> 57:24.523
You, all of Atlantis alive.

57:24.566 --> 57:25.983
Then where is it now?

57:26.025 --> 57:27.234
I don't know, I don't know.
You'd think something

57:27.318 --> 57:29.528
this important
would have been in the Journal, but...

57:29.571 --> 57:32.781
Unless... The missing page.

57:38.329 --> 57:39.538
You have a nice swim?

57:42.625 --> 57:44.543
Hey, guys, what's going on?

57:44.627 --> 57:47.212
What's... What's with all the guns?

57:48.715 --> 57:50.048
Guys?

57:52.469 --> 57:53.719
I am such an idiot.

57:54.179 --> 57:55.512
This is just another
treasure hunt for you.

57:55.555 --> 57:58.348
- You're after the crystal.
- Oh, you mean this?

58:00.059 --> 58:01.393
The heart of Atlantis.

58:01.478 --> 58:04.938
Yeah. About that,
I would've told you sooner,

58:05.023 --> 58:07.065
but it was strictly
on a need-to-know basis.

58:07.150 --> 58:09.067
And, well, now you know.

58:09.235 --> 58:10.944
I had to be sure you were one of us.

58:11.279 --> 58:12.946
Welcome to the club, son.

58:13.072 --> 58:14.740
I'm no mercenary.

58:27.587 --> 58:28.754
Mercenary?

58:28.838 --> 58:32.257
I prefer the term "adventure capitalist."

58:32.300 --> 58:33.759
Besides, you're the one
who got us here.

58:33.843 --> 58:35.552
You led us right to the treasure chest.

58:35.595 --> 58:37.262
You don't know what
you're tampering with, Rourke.

58:37.305 --> 58:39.848
What's to know? It's big. It's shiny.

58:39.933 --> 58:41.350
It's going to make us all rich.

58:41.434 --> 58:42.518
You think it's some kind of a diamond,

58:42.602 --> 58:45.270
I thought it was some kind of a battery,
but we're both wrong.

58:45.313 --> 58:46.980
It's their life force.

58:47.065 --> 58:49.066
That crystal is the only thing
keeping these people alive.

58:49.108 --> 58:50.817
You take that away, and they'll die.

58:50.902 --> 58:53.028
Well, that changes things.

58:53.112 --> 58:56.949
- Helga, what do you think?
- Knowing that, I'd double the price.

58:57.033 --> 58:58.534
I was thinking triple.

58:58.618 --> 59:00.953
Rourke, don't do this.

59:00.995 --> 59:04.414
Academics. You never want
to get your hands dirty.

59:04.874 --> 59:06.041
Think about it.

59:06.125 --> 59:09.336
If you gave back
every stolen artifact from a museum,

59:09.420 --> 59:11.213
you'd be left with an empty building.

59:11.297 --> 59:14.132
We're just providing
a necessary service

59:14.217 --> 59:16.426
to the archeological community.

59:16.469 --> 59:17.970
Not interested.

59:18.304 --> 59:20.597
I got to admit, I'm disappointed.

59:20.640 --> 59:23.267
You're an idealist,
just like your grandfather.

59:23.810 --> 59:26.520
Do yourself a favor, Milo.
Don't be like him.

59:26.604 --> 59:28.939
For once, do the smart thing.

59:31.442 --> 59:33.986
I really hate it
when negotiations go sour.

59:38.157 --> 59:39.992
Let's try this again.

59:45.248 --> 59:46.999
- Knock, knock.
- Room service.

59:48.167 --> 59:50.460
Tell them to drop their weapons... Now!

59:53.339 --> 59:55.507
Spread out! Search everywhere!

59:56.759 --> 59:58.302
You're not applying yourself, son.

59:58.386 --> 59:59.678
There's got to be something else.

59:59.762 --> 01:00:01.597
Well, there isn't. It just says,

01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:04.349
"The heart of Atlantis lies
in the eyes of her king."

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:06.143
Well, then maybe Old King Cole here

01:00:06.185 --> 01:00:08.103
can help us fill in the blanks.

01:00:08.187 --> 01:00:10.814
How about it, chief?
Where's the crystal chamber?

01:00:10.857 --> 01:00:12.733
You will destroy yourselves.

01:00:12.817 --> 01:00:15.027
Maybe I'm not being clear.

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:21.241
Rourke, this was not a part of the plan.

01:00:21.326 --> 01:00:23.076
Plan's changed, doc.

01:00:23.161 --> 01:00:25.454
I'd suggest you put a bandage
on that bleeding heart of yours.

01:00:25.872 --> 01:00:27.873
It doesn't suit a mercenary.

01:00:27.957 --> 01:00:31.293
Well, as usual, diplomacy has failed us.

01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:33.128
Now, I'm going to count to 10.

01:00:33.338 --> 01:00:35.255
And you're going to tell me
where the crystal is.

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:37.424
One...

01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:38.967
Two...

01:00:39.385 --> 01:00:40.719
Nine...

01:00:41.095 --> 01:00:42.387
T...

01:00:49.103 --> 01:00:52.606
The heart of Atlantis
lies in the eyes of her king.

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:54.775
This is it. We're in.

01:00:54.859 --> 01:00:57.235
Rourke, for the last time,
you've got to listen to me.

01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:00.238
You don't have the slightest idea
what this power is capable of.

01:01:00.281 --> 01:01:02.908
True, but I can think of a few countries

01:01:02.992 --> 01:01:05.911
who'd pay anything to find out.

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:10.332
Hurry. Get on.

01:01:30.395 --> 01:01:31.603
Jackpot.

01:01:42.323 --> 01:01:44.199
The kings of our past.

01:01:47.662 --> 01:01:49.413
Thatch, tell her to wrap it up.

01:01:49.455 --> 01:01:51.039
We got a schedule to meet.

01:01:59.132 --> 01:02:00.340
Kida...

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:02.509
I'm sorry.

01:02:15.022 --> 01:02:16.898
Come on, let's get this over with.

01:02:16.983 --> 01:02:17.983
I don't like this place.

01:02:18.192 --> 01:02:20.068
All right, Thatch, what's next?

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:22.154
Okay, there's a giant crystal

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:23.947
hovering 150 feet above our heads

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:25.490
over a bottomless pit of water.

01:02:25.533 --> 01:02:27.159
Doesn't anything surprise you?

01:02:27.201 --> 01:02:29.453
The only thing that surprises me
is you're still

01:02:29.871 --> 01:02:31.496
talking and
that thing's not on the truck yet.

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:34.124
- Now move it!
- I don't know how to move it.

01:02:34.167 --> 01:02:36.293
I don't even know
what's holding it up there.

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:46.178
Talk to me, Thatch. What's happening?

01:02:46.262 --> 01:02:49.639
Look, all it says here
is that the crystal is alive, somehow.

01:02:49.682 --> 01:02:51.183
I don't know how to explain it.

01:02:51.225 --> 01:02:53.643
It's their deity. It's their power source.

01:02:53.686 --> 01:02:55.395
Speak English, professor.

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:57.189
They're a part of it. It's a part of them.

01:02:57.231 --> 01:02:59.191
I'm doing the best I can here.

01:02:59.233 --> 01:03:00.901
- Well, do better.
- Oh, I know.

01:03:00.985 --> 01:03:03.653
Why don't you translate,
and I'll wave the gun around?

01:03:12.413 --> 01:03:13.872
What did she say?

01:03:13.915 --> 01:03:16.333
I don't know. I didn't catch it.

01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:38.266
Hold your horses, lover boy.

01:05:40.394 --> 01:05:45.482
Kida.

01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:13.385
No, don't. Don't touch her.

01:06:29.735 --> 01:06:31.444
All right, step back.

01:06:32.196 --> 01:06:34.072
Sergeant, keep those people back.

01:06:34.573 --> 01:06:36.199
You heard him. Step back.

01:06:37.785 --> 01:06:39.035
I'm warning you.

01:06:39.412 --> 01:06:40.537
So...

01:06:41.247 --> 01:06:43.039
I guess this is how it ends, huh?

01:06:43.416 --> 01:06:45.166
Fine. You win.

01:06:45.376 --> 01:06:47.335
You're wiping out an entire civilization,

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:49.713
but hey... You'll be rich.

01:06:49.922 --> 01:06:51.423
Congratulations, Audrey.

01:06:51.674 --> 01:06:52.966
Guess you and your dad will be able

01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:55.343
to open up that second garage after all.

01:06:56.178 --> 01:06:58.555
And, Vinny, you can start
a whole chain of flower shops.

01:06:58.597 --> 01:07:00.640
I'm sure your family's
going to be very proud.

01:07:00.766 --> 01:07:03.018
But that's what it's all about, right?

01:07:04.145 --> 01:07:06.980
- Money.
- Get off your soapbox, Thatch.

01:07:07.064 --> 01:07:09.649
You've read Darwin.
It's called natural selection.

01:07:09.942 --> 01:07:11.443
We're just helping it along.

01:07:11.485 --> 01:07:14.070
- Commander, we're ready.
- Yeah, give me a minute.

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.739
I know I'm forgetting something.

01:07:15.781 --> 01:07:18.742
I got the cargo, the crystal, the crew...

01:07:18.784 --> 01:07:20.660
Oh, yeah.

01:07:23.330 --> 01:07:25.123
Look at it this way, son.

01:07:25.207 --> 01:07:27.459
You were the man
who discovered Atlantis,

01:07:27.543 --> 01:07:29.836
and now, you're part of the exhibit.

01:07:38.763 --> 01:07:40.305
Let's move, people.

01:07:40.973 --> 01:07:43.892
That was an order,
not a suggestion. Let's go!

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:25.517
We're all going to die.

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:31.773
Oh, you can't be serious.

01:08:31.857 --> 01:08:33.233
This is wrong, and you know it.

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:35.568
We're this close
to our biggest payday ever,

01:08:35.653 --> 01:08:38.113
and you pick now of all times
to grow a conscience.

01:08:38.572 --> 01:08:40.281
We've done a lot of things
we're not proud of,

01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:43.535
robbing graves, plundering tombs,

01:08:43.577 --> 01:08:46.912
double parking, but nobody got hurt.

01:08:47.288 --> 01:08:50.875
Well, maybe somebody got hurt,
but nobody we knew.

01:08:51.001 --> 01:08:53.461
Well, if that's the way you want it, fine.

01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:54.962
More for me.

01:08:56.549 --> 01:08:58.716
P.T. Barnum was right.

01:09:18.237 --> 01:09:20.196
- We can't let him do this!
- Wait a second.

01:09:35.587 --> 01:09:37.087
Okay, now you can go.

01:09:37.131 --> 01:09:39.465
Milo, you better get up here.

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:44.554
How's he doing?

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:46.723
Not good, I'm afraid.

01:09:46.765 --> 01:09:48.183
Internal bleeding.

01:09:48.475 --> 01:09:50.018
There's nothing more I can do.

01:09:50.102 --> 01:09:51.269
What a nightmare.

01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:54.939
- And I brought it here.
- Don't go beating yourself up.

01:09:54.982 --> 01:09:56.733
He's been after that crystal
since Iceland.

01:09:58.569 --> 01:10:00.612
The crystal. Sweet, that's it.

01:10:00.654 --> 01:10:04.073
These... These crystals,
they have some sort of healing energy.

01:10:04.116 --> 01:10:06.075
I've seen it work.

01:10:06.118 --> 01:10:07.202
No.

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:09.287
Where is my daughter?

01:10:09.496 --> 01:10:11.331
Well, she...

01:10:12.791 --> 01:10:15.627
She has been chosen,
like her mother before her.

01:10:16.295 --> 01:10:17.378
What?

01:10:17.463 --> 01:10:18.963
In times of danger,

01:10:19.006 --> 01:10:21.299
the crystal will choose a host,

01:10:21.342 --> 01:10:24.510
one of royal blood, to protect itself

01:10:24.595 --> 01:10:25.845
and its people.

01:10:26.388 --> 01:10:27.847
It will accept no other.

01:10:27.932 --> 01:10:30.099
Wait a minute. Choose?

01:10:30.142 --> 01:10:32.227
So this thing is alive?

01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:33.645
In a way.

01:10:34.313 --> 01:10:36.189
The crystal thrives

01:10:36.273 --> 01:10:40.151
on the collective emotions
of all who came before us.

01:10:40.736 --> 01:10:44.280
In return, it provides power,

01:10:44.323 --> 01:10:47.158
longevity, protection.

01:10:47.326 --> 01:10:48.868
As it grew,

01:10:48.953 --> 01:10:51.996
it developed
a consciousness of its own.

01:10:54.208 --> 01:10:55.917
In my arrogance,

01:10:56.001 --> 01:10:59.170
I sought to use it as a weapon of war,

01:10:59.213 --> 01:11:03.174
but it's power proved
too great to control.

01:11:03.759 --> 01:11:08.137
It overwhelmed us
and led to our destruction.

01:11:08.847 --> 01:11:11.015
That's why you hid it beneath the city.

01:11:11.058 --> 01:11:12.850
To keep history from repeating itself.

01:11:12.935 --> 01:11:18.523
And to prevent Kida from suffering
the same fate as my beloved wife.

01:11:18.607 --> 01:11:21.693
What do you mean?
What's going to happen to Kida?

01:11:21.735 --> 01:11:25.363
If she remains bonded to the crystal,

01:11:25.406 --> 01:11:28.741
she could be lost to it forever.

01:11:30.244 --> 01:11:33.204
The love of my daughter
is all I have left.

01:11:34.373 --> 01:11:36.666
My burden would have become hers

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:41.879
when the time was right,
but now, it falls to you.

01:11:41.922 --> 01:11:43.131
Me?

01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:45.883
Return the crystal.

01:11:47.678 --> 01:11:49.262
Save Atlantis.

01:11:49.805 --> 01:11:51.431
Save my daughter.

01:12:12.745 --> 01:12:14.787
So, what's it going to be?

01:12:16.498 --> 01:12:20.418
- Excuse me?
- I followed you in, and I'll follow you out.

01:12:20.502 --> 01:12:22.920
- It's your decision.
- Oh, my decision?

01:12:22.963 --> 01:12:25.715
Well, I think we've seen
how effective my decisions have been.

01:12:25.758 --> 01:12:26.841
Let's recap.

01:12:26.925 --> 01:12:29.093
I lead a band of plundering vandals

01:12:29.136 --> 01:12:31.637
to the greatest archeological find
in recorded history,

01:12:31.722 --> 01:12:35.183
thus enabling the kidnap
and/or murder of the royal family.

01:12:35.267 --> 01:12:36.934
Not to mention personally delivering

01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:40.438
the most powerful force known to man
into the hands of a mercenary nutcase

01:12:40.481 --> 01:12:42.607
who's probably going
to sell it to the Kaiser!

01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:44.359
Have I left anything out?

01:12:44.651 --> 01:12:45.943
Well, you did set the camp on fire

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:48.196
- and drop us down that big hole.
- Thank you.

01:12:48.739 --> 01:12:50.406
Thank you very much.

01:12:54.286 --> 01:12:56.788
Of course, it's been my experience
when you hit bottom,

01:12:57.289 --> 01:12:58.873
the only place left to go is up.

01:12:58.957 --> 01:13:01.084
Who told you that?

01:13:01.126 --> 01:13:03.878
A fella by the name
of Thaddeus Thatch.

01:13:12.638 --> 01:13:13.888
Where are you going?

01:13:14.139 --> 01:13:16.891
- I'm going after Rourke.
- Milo, that's crazy.

01:13:16.975 --> 01:13:20.770
I didn't say it was the smart thing.
But it is the right thing.

01:13:22.773 --> 01:13:26.359
Come on. We better make sure
he doesn't hurt himself.

01:13:28.529 --> 01:13:30.696
Milo, what do you think you are doing?

01:13:30.781 --> 01:13:31.906
Just follow my lead.

01:13:36.328 --> 01:13:38.496
Wow. I'm impressed.

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:39.997
It's simple. All you got to do...

01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:41.332
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Shut up. We get it, okay?

01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:42.875
No, no, wait!

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:48.673
Gently. Just gently.

01:13:48.841 --> 01:13:51.384
Hey, Milo, you got something sporty?

01:13:51.468 --> 01:13:53.052
You know, like a tuna?

01:13:53.137 --> 01:13:56.389
- How is this done?
- All you got to do is use the crystals.

01:13:56.515 --> 01:13:57.682
Kida showed me.

01:13:59.977 --> 01:14:02.854
Half-turn right, quarter-turn back.
Keep your hand on the pad.

01:14:05.732 --> 01:14:08.025
Saddle up, partners.
Bring jerky and ammo.

01:14:10.487 --> 01:14:12.321
I'm so excited.

01:14:16.243 --> 01:14:17.452
All right, this is it!

01:14:17.536 --> 01:14:19.036
We're going to rescue the princess.

01:14:19.079 --> 01:14:20.746
We're going to save Atlantis.

01:14:20.831 --> 01:14:24.041
Or we're going to die trying.
Now let's do it!

01:14:47.399 --> 01:14:49.192
I love it when I win.

01:15:05.792 --> 01:15:07.210
Okay, here's the plan.

01:15:07.252 --> 01:15:10.171
We're going to come in low and fast
and take them by surprise.

01:15:10.255 --> 01:15:11.756
Well, I've got news for you, Milo.

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:14.550
Rourke is never surprised,
and he's got a lot of guns.

01:15:14.593 --> 01:15:16.511
Great. Well, do you have
any suggestions?

01:15:16.595 --> 01:15:18.638
Yeah. Don't get shot.

01:15:26.438 --> 01:15:27.688
There they are!

01:15:27.773 --> 01:15:29.065
We've got company!

01:15:32.319 --> 01:15:33.778
Take off!

01:15:41.745 --> 01:15:42.828
Take her up!

01:15:50.295 --> 01:15:52.046
Holy smokes!

01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:54.257
You told me he only had guns.

01:15:54.299 --> 01:15:56.259
What I said was, he's never surprised.

01:16:07.312 --> 01:16:09.564
Okay, now things are getting good.

01:16:09.648 --> 01:16:10.982
Vinny! Heads up!

01:16:11.024 --> 01:16:13.317
We can't let them reach
the top of that shaft!

01:16:30.294 --> 01:16:33.212
Vinny, new plan.
You and me, we're going to be decoys.

01:16:33.297 --> 01:16:36.591
Audrey, Sweet, fly up underneath
that thing and cut her loose.

01:16:36.675 --> 01:16:37.842
We're on it.

01:16:41.638 --> 01:16:42.847
Lieutenant!

01:16:51.356 --> 01:16:53.983
I thought you said this thing could
cut through a femur in 28 seconds!

01:16:54.026 --> 01:16:55.318
Less talk, more saw.

01:17:06.830 --> 01:17:09.874
Looks like somebody's
working overtime.

01:17:12.878 --> 01:17:14.420
Come on, girl. Time's up.

01:17:15.881 --> 01:17:19.133
All right, Milo, this is it. Any last words?

01:17:20.177 --> 01:17:22.637
Yeah. I really wish I had
a better idea than this!

01:17:27.517 --> 01:17:28.851
We're losing altitude.

01:17:28.894 --> 01:17:30.019
Lighten the load.

01:17:31.563 --> 01:17:33.648
That's it,
unless someone wants to jump.

01:17:33.732 --> 01:17:35.316
Ladies first.

01:17:40.447 --> 01:17:42.365
You said we were in this together!

01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:45.076
You promised me a percentage!

01:17:46.036 --> 01:17:47.995
Next time, get it in writing.

01:17:50.165 --> 01:17:51.582
Nothing personal.

01:18:01.718 --> 01:18:04.595
Well, I have to hand it to you.
You're a bigger pain in the neck

01:18:04.638 --> 01:18:06.806
than I would have
ever thought possible.

01:18:08.975 --> 01:18:11.519
I consider myself
an even-tempered man.

01:18:11.603 --> 01:18:13.604
It takes a lot to get under my skin.

01:18:13.689 --> 01:18:17.650
But congratulations,
you just won the solid-gold kewpie doll.

01:18:28.787 --> 01:18:30.246
Nothing personal.

01:18:40.298 --> 01:18:41.966
Tired, Mr. Thatch?

01:18:42.801 --> 01:18:45.636
That's a darn shame

01:18:46.513 --> 01:18:49.473
because I'm just getting warmed up.

01:19:10.328 --> 01:19:11.746
Thank heaven.

01:19:28.346 --> 01:19:29.680
Oh, great!

01:19:43.945 --> 01:19:46.530
The volcano... She awakes!

01:19:46.573 --> 01:19:48.574
Hey, I had nothing to do with it.

01:19:48.658 --> 01:19:50.451
This here would be
a good place not to be.

01:19:50.535 --> 01:19:53.037
No, wait. We got to get her back
or the whole city will die.

01:19:53.121 --> 01:19:54.955
And if we don't get out of here, we'll die.

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.540
It's the only way to reverse this.

01:19:56.625 --> 01:19:58.209
Just do it!

01:20:09.179 --> 01:20:10.554
Milo, no!

01:20:17.187 --> 01:20:18.229
Go!

01:20:53.306 --> 01:20:57.393
The fissure,
it is about to eject its pyroclastic fury!

01:20:57.435 --> 01:20:59.603
Milo, Mole says the wall's going to blow!

01:24:21.848 --> 01:24:23.057
Milo?

01:25:12.649 --> 01:25:15.109
Atlantis will honor your names forever.

01:25:15.527 --> 01:25:17.528
I only wish there was more
we could do for you.

01:25:17.737 --> 01:25:21.490
You know, thanks anyway,
but I think we're good.

01:25:23.034 --> 01:25:24.827
They'll take you as far as the surface.

01:25:24.869 --> 01:25:26.703
We are really going to miss you, Milo.

01:25:26.746 --> 01:25:29.206
You know, I'm going
to reopen the flower shop,

01:25:29.249 --> 01:25:32.417
and I'm going to think of
you guys every single day,

01:25:32.502 --> 01:25:35.379
Monday through Friday, 9:00 to 5:00,

01:25:35.463 --> 01:25:36.755
Saturday until 2:00.

01:25:37.215 --> 01:25:40.217
Sunday... I'm going to take Sunday off,
probably, and...

01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:42.052
Maybe I'll go in for
a couple of hours, you know.

01:25:42.095 --> 01:25:44.596
But August... I'm going to take August.

01:25:44.889 --> 01:25:47.599
I ain't so good at speechifying,

01:25:47.684 --> 01:25:49.810
but I wanted you to have this.

01:25:49.894 --> 01:25:52.020
It's the bacon grease
from the whole trip.

01:25:52.147 --> 01:25:53.730
Cookie, I...

01:25:58.570 --> 01:26:00.737
Two for flinching.

01:26:01.614 --> 01:26:02.656
See you, Milo.

01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:05.284
Hey, Milo!

01:26:05.368 --> 01:26:07.536
Mole.

01:26:07.579 --> 01:26:10.747
Mole. Wow. Hey, well...

01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:11.999
Good-bye, Mole.

01:26:12.208 --> 01:26:13.667
Now, you sure you want to stay?

01:26:13.751 --> 01:26:16.461
There's a hero's welcome waiting for
the man who discovered Atlantis.

01:26:16.546 --> 01:26:19.006
Ah, I don't think
the world needs another hero.

01:26:19.090 --> 01:26:22.551
Besides, I hear there's an opening
down here for an expert in gibberish.

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:25.053
You take good care of
yourself, Milo Thatch.

01:26:25.096 --> 01:26:27.556
Yeah. You, too, Sweet.

01:26:27.599 --> 01:26:28.640
Come here.

01:26:30.768 --> 01:26:33.437
Sweet, before you go, could you...

01:26:33.479 --> 01:26:34.521
No problem.

01:26:34.606 --> 01:26:36.023
Thanks.

01:26:36.107 --> 01:26:38.275
Oh, you're getting a bill.

01:26:38.443 --> 01:26:39.860
Can we go home now?

01:26:39.986 --> 01:26:43.155
Come on, y'all. Let's get
one last shot in front of the fish.

01:26:44.574 --> 01:26:46.950
- Say gochk!
- Gochk!

01:26:53.082 --> 01:26:56.335
Now, let's go over it again,
just so we got it straight.

01:26:56.878 --> 01:27:00.214
- You didn't find anything?
- Nope. Just a lot of rocks...

01:27:00.465 --> 01:27:02.257
And fish, little fish.

01:27:03.051 --> 01:27:04.259
Sponges.

01:27:04.385 --> 01:27:05.677
What happened to Helga?

01:27:05.762 --> 01:27:08.680
Well, we lost her when
a flaming zeppelin come down on her.

01:27:09.057 --> 01:27:11.850
- Missing.
- That's right. And Rourke?

01:27:11.935 --> 01:27:14.686
Nervous breakdown.
You could say he went all to pieces.

01:27:14.771 --> 01:27:17.648
In fact, you could say
he was transamorgafied

01:27:17.732 --> 01:27:19.483
and then busted into a zillion...

01:27:19.525 --> 01:27:21.652
Ahem. He's missing, too.

01:27:21.694 --> 01:27:23.820
- What about Milo?
- Went down with the sub.

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:31.328
Lord, give me strength.

01:27:31.955 --> 01:27:33.705
I'm going to miss that boy.

01:27:34.666 --> 01:27:36.667
At least he's in a better place now.

01:27:45.093 --> 01:27:46.969
Dear Mr. Whitmore,

01:27:47.011 --> 01:27:49.096
I hope this piece of proof
is enough for you.

01:27:50.139 --> 01:27:54.101
It sure convinced me.
Thanks from both of us.
