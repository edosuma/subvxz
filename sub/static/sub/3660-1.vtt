00:55.101 --> 00:56.595
<i>Somebody asked me:</i>

00:56.853 --> 01:00.103
<i>"Phil, if you could be anywhere,</i>
<i>where would you be?"</i>

01:00.356 --> 01:02.894
I said to him,
"Probably right here...

01:03.151 --> 01:06.235
...Elko, Nevada."
Our nation's high at 79 today.

01:06.529 --> 01:09.150
In California, they'll have
warm weather tomorrow...

01:09.407 --> 01:12.028
...gang wars and some
overpriced real estate.

01:12.285 --> 01:15.120
In the Pacific Northwest,
they'll have some...

01:15.413 --> 01:17.037
...very, very tall trees.

01:17.290 --> 01:19.828
Clear across the Rockies
and Great Plains.

01:20.084 --> 01:22.492
But look out, here comes trouble.

01:24.672 --> 01:25.703
Oh, boy!

01:26.299 --> 01:28.090
Front coming our way!
Look out!

01:28.551 --> 01:32.134
What will that mean to us?
One of these big blue things!

01:32.388 --> 01:36.255
This cold, frigid arctic air,
this big mass out of the north.

01:37.185 --> 01:40.470
It'll meet up with all this
moisture out of the Gulf.

01:40.730 --> 01:43.102
They'll mix at high altitudes
and cause snow.

01:43.816 --> 01:48.811
It won't hit us here in Pittsburgh.
It'll push off and hit Altoona.

01:49.030 --> 01:50.109
Close call!

01:50.364 --> 01:52.024
Let's look at the five-day.

01:52.700 --> 01:55.654
As you can see, nothing to be
too scared about.

01:56.162 --> 01:59.613
Bundle up warm, but you can
leave your galoshes at home.

01:59.832 --> 02:02.584
I won't be here at 10:00.
Tomorrow's Groundhog Day.

02:02.835 --> 02:07.331
I'll be in Punxsutawney for our
country's oldest Groundhog Festival.

02:07.590 --> 02:10.793
According to the legend,
tomorrow, February 2nd...

02:11.093 --> 02:13.798
...if the groundhog wakes
and sees his shadow...

02:14.013 --> 02:16.136
...we've got six more weeks
of winter.

02:16.432 --> 02:17.463
Sounds like fun.

02:17.725 --> 02:21.260
You must really enjoy it.
This is your third year in a row.

02:21.521 --> 02:22.766
Four, Nan.

02:23.022 --> 02:23.971
Four.

02:24.232 --> 02:25.394
Thanks, Phil.

02:25.858 --> 02:30.319
Next, our entertainment editor
looks at sex and violence in movies.

02:30.571 --> 02:31.650
Stay with us.

02:34.742 --> 02:35.773
We're clear.

02:36.035 --> 02:37.909
Have fun in Punxsutawney.

02:38.913 --> 02:43.908
For your information, Hairdo,
a major network is interested in me.

02:44.168 --> 02:46.790
That would be the
Home Shopping Network.

02:48.172 --> 02:50.842
Thanks, Larry.
Go wait in the van.

02:51.425 --> 02:53.916
That was nice, Phil.
"Big trees"!

02:54.178 --> 02:55.044
Stop, Kenny.

02:55.263 --> 02:57.932
Look, can you handle
the 10:00 or not?

02:58.266 --> 03:02.310
If you don't want to rush back,
I can do the 5:00 tomorrow.

03:02.562 --> 03:05.516
Stay an extra second in Punxsutawney?
Please!

03:05.773 --> 03:07.980
Rita thinks it'd be
a great idea...

03:08.234 --> 03:11.603
...to stay for other events.
You'll get incredible footage.

03:11.863 --> 03:14.188
The people and the fun.
The excitement!

03:14.448 --> 03:17.615
You haven't worked with her yet.
She's really nice.

03:17.827 --> 03:20.994
I think she'll be
a really good producer.

03:21.247 --> 03:23.655
You guys are going to have fun.

03:25.960 --> 03:30.124
She's fun. But not my kind of fun.
I'll be here for the 5:00.

04:32.276 --> 04:34.233
Can you keep a secret, Larry?

04:34.987 --> 04:36.945
I'm probably leaving PBH.

04:37.406 --> 04:40.028
So this will be the last time...

04:40.368 --> 04:41.862
...we do the Groundhog together.

04:42.703 --> 04:45.373
What's wrong with
the Groundhog Festival?

04:45.623 --> 04:46.702
In San Diego...

04:46.958 --> 04:50.623
...I covered the swallows returning
to Capistrano for six years.

04:51.295 --> 04:55.459
Someone will see me interview
a groundhog and think I have no future.

04:55.675 --> 04:57.751
I think it's a nice story.

04:58.010 --> 05:00.798
He comes out.
He looks around.

05:01.013 --> 05:02.757
He wrinkles up his nose.

05:03.015 --> 05:06.799
He sees his shadow or not.
It's nice! People like it!

05:07.061 --> 05:09.433
You are new, aren't you?

05:10.147 --> 05:12.306
People like blood sausage too.

05:12.900 --> 05:14.063
People are morons!

05:14.694 --> 05:16.318
Nice attitude.

05:16.571 --> 05:20.900
Look in the mirror and see how you
look when you do that groundhog thing.

05:21.158 --> 05:22.321
For me? Once?

05:22.535 --> 05:26.319
He comes out, and there he
looks at his little shadow.

05:27.748 --> 05:29.622
Want some blood sausage?
I have some...

05:29.834 --> 05:31.743
I like blood sausage.

06:31.020 --> 06:32.562
Rita, I can't stay here.

06:34.106 --> 06:35.351
Prima donna.

06:36.025 --> 06:37.816
- What's the matter?
- I hate this place.

06:38.027 --> 06:40.696
I stayed here two years ago.
I was miserable.

06:40.905 --> 06:43.526
- I won't stay here.
- You're not staying here.

06:43.783 --> 06:44.897
I'm not?

06:45.910 --> 06:47.155
Larry's dropping me off.

06:47.370 --> 06:49.943
I booked you in
a nice bed and breakfast.

06:51.040 --> 06:52.155
Great.

06:53.084 --> 06:56.583
I think this is one of the traits
of a good producer.

06:56.879 --> 06:58.539
Keep the talent happy.

06:58.965 --> 07:00.245
Anything I can do.

07:00.633 --> 07:03.041
Would you help me
with my pelvic tilt?

07:04.971 --> 07:08.589
Within reason. Want to come
to dinner with Larry and me?

07:09.308 --> 07:12.013
No, thank you.
I've seen Larry eat.

07:14.438 --> 07:17.143
You get your sleep.
See you in the morning.

07:18.025 --> 07:19.401
Don't be late.

07:21.696 --> 07:24.187
Did he actually call himself
"the talent"?

07:52.476 --> 07:55.928
<i>Campers, rise and shine!</i>
<i>Don't forget your booties.</i>

07:56.188 --> 07:58.976
- <i>It's cold out there!</i>
- <i>It's cold every day!</i>

07:59.192 --> 08:01.480
- <i>Is this Miami Beach?</i>
- <i>Not hardly!</i>

08:01.736 --> 08:04.523
<i>Expect hazardous travel</i>
<i>later today with...</i>

08:04.780 --> 08:06.191
<i>...that blizzard thing.</i>

08:06.449 --> 08:09.569
<i>That blizzard thing.</i>
<i>Here's the report.</i>

08:09.827 --> 08:14.157
<i>The National Weather Service</i>
<i>is calling for a big blizzard thing.</i>

08:14.373 --> 08:17.161
<i>There's another reason</i>
<i>today's especially ex citing...</i>

08:17.376 --> 08:19.120
<i>Especially cold.</i>

08:19.337 --> 08:21.792
<i>The big question</i>
<i>on everybody's lips...</i>

08:22.048 --> 08:24.717
- <i>Their chapped lips.</i>
- <i>On their chapped lips.</i>

08:24.926 --> 08:27.547
<i>Will Phil come out</i>
<i>and see his shadow?</i>

08:27.803 --> 08:31.089
- <i>Punxsutawney Phil!</i>
- <i>That's right, woodchuck chuckers!</i>

08:31.349 --> 08:32.759
<i>It's Groundhog Day!</i>

08:33.017 --> 08:36.053
<i>Get up and chuck me a hog!</i>

08:40.107 --> 08:41.270
- Morning!
- Morning.

08:41.525 --> 08:43.602
- Off to see the groundhog?
- I am.

08:43.820 --> 08:45.896
Think it'll be an early spring?

08:46.113 --> 08:48.189
I'm predicting March 21st.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.659
Good guess!

08:51.118 --> 08:54.534
I think that actually is
the first day of spring.

09:01.796 --> 09:05.794
- Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?
- I slept alone, Mrs. Lancaster.

09:06.968 --> 09:08.296
Like some coffee?

09:08.553 --> 09:13.013
Is there any possibility of getting
an espresso or cappuccino?

09:13.224 --> 09:15.216
I really don't know...

09:15.518 --> 09:19.053
How to spell espresso or cappuccino.
This looks fine.

09:19.313 --> 09:21.472
I hope you enjoy the festivities.

09:21.732 --> 09:24.983
- I'm sure I will.
- There's talk of a blizzard.

09:25.570 --> 09:28.736
We may catch a break and
it will blow right by.

09:28.990 --> 09:31.148
The moisture coming
out of the south...

09:31.409 --> 09:33.615
...by midday will
push on to the east.

09:33.828 --> 09:38.822
At high altitudes it'll crystallize
and give us what we call snow.

09:39.041 --> 09:42.825
Our high will get to
about 30 today, teens tonight.

09:43.045 --> 09:46.794
Chance of precipitation,
about 20% today, 20% tomorrow.

09:47.049 --> 09:50.050
Did you want to talk about
the weather or just chitchat?

09:50.970 --> 09:52.001
Chitchat.

09:52.263 --> 09:53.805
See you later.

09:57.351 --> 09:59.261
Will you be checking out today?

09:59.479 --> 10:01.804
Chance of departure today, 100%.

10:24.504 --> 10:26.994
Phil Connors!
I thought that was you!

10:27.215 --> 10:29.503
How you doing?
Thanks for watching.

10:29.759 --> 10:34.255
Don't tell me you don't remember me.
I sure as heckfire remember you.

10:35.306 --> 10:36.421
Not a chance.

10:36.641 --> 10:38.051
Ned!

10:39.101 --> 10:40.845
Ryerson!

10:41.687 --> 10:43.431
Needlenose Ned.
Ned the Head.

10:43.648 --> 10:46.055
Come on, buddy,
Case Western High!

10:46.275 --> 10:50.190
I did the whistling bellybutton
trick at the talent show.

10:50.446 --> 10:55.322
Bing! Got the shingles real bad
senior year. Almost didn't graduate.

10:55.618 --> 10:57.492
Bing again!

10:57.703 --> 11:01.783
I dated your sister a couple times
till you told me not to anymore.

11:01.999 --> 11:03.280
Well?

11:04.126 --> 11:04.992
Ned Ryerson?

11:05.253 --> 11:06.201
Bing!

11:06.462 --> 11:07.743
Bing.

11:08.589 --> 11:11.507
Did you turn pro with
that bellybutton thing?

11:11.717 --> 11:13.093
I sell insurance.

11:13.344 --> 11:15.586
- What a shock.
- Do you have insurance?

11:15.805 --> 11:17.762
If you do, you could
always use more.

11:17.974 --> 11:20.595
Am I right or am I right
or am I right?

11:22.436 --> 11:25.390
I would love to stand here
and talk with you.

11:25.606 --> 11:26.887
But I'm not going to.

11:27.150 --> 11:28.098
See you.

11:28.359 --> 11:30.186
That's all right!
I'll walk with you.

11:30.403 --> 11:33.320
I see an opportunity,
I charge it like a bull.

11:33.573 --> 11:35.399
Ned the Bull, that's me now.

11:35.658 --> 11:39.193
I got friends who live and die
by the actuarial tables.

11:39.453 --> 11:42.490
I say it's all one big
crapshoot anyhoo.

11:42.707 --> 11:47.618
Ever heard of single-premium life?
That could be the ticket for you.

11:47.879 --> 11:49.289
Oh, God!

11:49.547 --> 11:53.461
It is so good to see you!
What are you doing for dinner?

11:53.718 --> 11:54.998
Something else.

11:55.219 --> 11:58.719
It's been great seeing you,
Needlehead. Take care.

12:02.894 --> 12:06.512
Watch out for that first step.
It's a doozy!

12:35.426 --> 12:36.505
Phil!

12:36.719 --> 12:38.344
Phil, over here!

12:38.679 --> 12:40.055
Where have you been?

12:40.306 --> 12:41.848
It was horrible.

12:42.099 --> 12:44.009
A giant leech got me.

12:44.518 --> 12:46.844
You're missing all the fun.
These people are great!

12:47.104 --> 12:50.723
Some of them partied all night.
They sing till they get cold.

12:50.942 --> 12:53.563
Then they go sit by the fire
and get warm.

12:53.778 --> 12:56.185
Then they come back
and sing some more!

12:57.031 --> 12:58.822
They're hicks, Rita.

12:59.700 --> 13:01.989
So did you sleep okay without me?

13:02.245 --> 13:03.988
You tossed and turned, didn't you?

13:04.205 --> 13:05.403
You're incredible.

13:05.748 --> 13:06.863
Who told you?

13:08.918 --> 13:10.163
It's groundhog time.

13:14.006 --> 13:15.798
Okay.
On me in three...

13:16.008 --> 13:17.716
...two, one.

13:18.678 --> 13:23.423
Once a year, the eyes of the nation
turn to this tiny hamlet...

13:23.683 --> 13:25.307
...to watch a master at work.

13:25.560 --> 13:26.473
The master?

13:26.727 --> 13:28.056
Punxsutawney Phil...

13:28.312 --> 13:31.598
...the world's most famous weatherman.
The groundhog.

13:31.858 --> 13:35.986
Who, as legend has it,
can predict an early spring.

13:36.237 --> 13:38.906
The question we have
to ask ourselves is:

13:39.156 --> 13:41.149
"Does Phil feel lucky?"

13:43.286 --> 13:47.414
Every year, the guy comes with
a big stick and raps on the door.

13:47.623 --> 13:50.375
They pull the little rat out,
talk to him.

13:50.626 --> 13:53.912
The rat talks back.
Then they tell us when it'll end.

14:00.344 --> 14:02.136
Isn't he cute?

14:04.182 --> 14:07.597
Do you like the guys
with the prominent upper teeth?

14:18.112 --> 14:22.026
This February 2nd, at 7:20
and 30 seconds...

14:22.241 --> 14:23.700
...Punxsutawney Phil...

14:23.951 --> 14:25.493
...the seer of seers...

14:25.745 --> 14:28.699
...prognosticator of prognosticators...

14:28.998 --> 14:30.907
...emerged reluctantly...

14:31.167 --> 14:32.198
...but alertly...

14:32.418 --> 14:34.458
...in Punxsutawney, PA...

14:34.795 --> 14:37.369
...and stated in groundhog-ese...

14:37.632 --> 14:39.790
..."I definitely see a shadow."

14:42.678 --> 14:43.627
Sorry, folks.

14:43.888 --> 14:46.461
Six more weeks of winter.

14:51.938 --> 14:52.851
On me in three...

14:53.064 --> 14:54.724
...two, one.

14:56.108 --> 14:58.397
This is one time where
television fails...

14:58.611 --> 15:01.481
...to capture the excitement
of a large squirrel...

15:01.739 --> 15:02.937
...predicting the weather.

15:03.199 --> 15:06.484
I'm grateful to have been here.
From Punxsutawney...

15:06.744 --> 15:09.413
...this is Phil Connors.
So long.

15:09.622 --> 15:11.780
Want to try it again
without the sarcasm?

15:12.041 --> 15:14.579
We got it.
I'm out of here.

15:15.461 --> 15:17.121
Prima donnas.

15:29.850 --> 15:32.424
Oh, boy.
Take a look at this.

15:33.563 --> 15:35.223
What is going on?

15:35.439 --> 15:39.389
I don't know. Perhaps that
blizzard we're not supposed to get.

15:39.694 --> 15:41.520
This is impossible.

15:43.447 --> 15:46.532
Nobody honks this horn but me,
okay, pal?

16:07.930 --> 16:09.424
Take it out of here.

16:10.141 --> 16:12.264
Commander, what's going on?

16:12.518 --> 16:14.641
Nothing.
We're closing the road.

16:14.896 --> 16:18.478
- Big blizzard moving in.
- It's a couple of flakes.

16:18.983 --> 16:21.391
Don't you listen to the weather?

16:21.944 --> 16:23.604
I make the weather.

16:23.821 --> 16:28.816
All this moisture from the Gulf
will push off to the east in Altoona.

16:29.118 --> 16:31.526
You got that moisture on your head.

16:31.829 --> 16:33.738
You can go back to Punxsutawney...

16:34.415 --> 16:37.286
...or you can freeze to death.
It's your choice.

16:37.627 --> 16:39.666
So, what's it going to be?

16:42.632 --> 16:43.794
I'm thinking.

16:44.425 --> 16:48.008
Come on, all the long-distance
lines are down?

16:48.846 --> 16:50.305
What about the satellite?

16:50.556 --> 16:52.465
Is it snowing in space?

16:53.643 --> 16:57.972
Don't you keep a line open
for emergencies or celebrities?

16:59.106 --> 17:02.475
I'm both.
I'm a celebrity in an emergency.

17:03.110 --> 17:05.483
Can you patch me through
on that line?

17:12.744 --> 17:15.948
Could I have one more of these
with some booze in it?

17:17.083 --> 17:18.660
I like it here.

17:20.127 --> 17:22.119
Going to the groundhog dinner?

17:22.380 --> 17:24.088
No, I had groundhog for lunch.

17:24.298 --> 17:26.587
Wasn't bad.
Tastes like chicken.

17:26.800 --> 17:27.714
You two run along.

17:30.012 --> 17:32.088
Looking foxy tonight, man.

17:32.640 --> 17:35.807
Is your troop selling
cookies again this year?

17:36.060 --> 17:37.340
That's so funny.

17:37.687 --> 17:39.062
So, what are you doing?

17:39.605 --> 17:41.812
I think I'll go back to my room...

17:42.066 --> 17:45.601
...take a hot shower
and maybe read <i>Hustler.</i>

17:45.820 --> 17:47.231
Suit yourself.

18:05.882 --> 18:06.961
Yo, mom.

18:07.216 --> 18:08.924
Isn't there any hot water?

18:09.177 --> 18:11.050
Oh, no, there wouldn't be today.

18:11.304 --> 18:13.759
Of course not.
Silly me.

18:13.973 --> 18:15.432
Sweet dreams.

18:39.123 --> 18:42.243
<i>Campers, rise and shine!</i>
<i>Don't forget your booties.</i>

18:42.501 --> 18:45.668
- <i>It's cold out there!</i>
- <i>It's cold every day!</i>

18:45.922 --> 18:47.748
- <i>Is this Miami Beach?</i>
- <i>Not hardly!</i>

18:48.007 --> 18:51.293
Nice going, boys.
You're playing yesterday's tape.

18:51.552 --> 18:53.011
- <i>with that blizzard thing.</i>

18:53.262 --> 18:55.932
<i>That blizzard thing?</i>
<i>Here's the report.</i>

18:56.140 --> 19:00.636
<i>The National Weather Service</i>
<i>is calling for a big blizzard thing.</i>

19:00.853 --> 19:03.854
<i>There's another reason</i>
<i>today's especially ex citing...</i>

19:04.065 --> 19:06.104
<i>Especially cold.</i>

19:06.359 --> 19:08.517
<i>The big question</i>
<i>on everybody's lips...</i>

19:08.778 --> 19:11.316
- Chapped lips.
- <i>Their chapped lips.</i>

19:11.572 --> 19:14.443
<i>Will Phil come out</i>
<i>and see his shadow?</i>

19:14.659 --> 19:17.992
- <i>Punxsutawney Phil!</i>
- <i>That's right, woodchuck chuckers!</i>

19:18.204 --> 19:19.579
<i>It's Groundhog Day!</i>

19:19.789 --> 19:21.497
<i>Get up and chuck me a hog!</i>

19:26.712 --> 19:28.255
What the hell?

19:36.305 --> 19:39.223
Morning!
Off to see the groundhog?

19:40.851 --> 19:42.595
Think it'll be an early spring?

19:43.479 --> 19:45.353
Didn't we do this yesterday?

19:45.982 --> 19:47.440
I don't know what you mean.

19:48.359 --> 19:50.352
Don't mess with me, Pork Chop!

19:50.736 --> 19:53.821
- What day is this?
- It's February 2nd.

19:54.156 --> 19:55.615
Groundhog Day.

19:58.536 --> 20:01.453
I'm sorry.
I thought it was yesterday.

20:23.895 --> 20:25.971
Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

20:26.564 --> 20:28.272
Did I sleep well?

20:28.566 --> 20:30.226
Like some coffee?

20:30.484 --> 20:33.154
Yes, please.
I think I'll have a double.

20:33.446 --> 20:35.818
I hope you enjoy the festivities.

20:36.240 --> 20:38.482
There's talk of a blizzard.

20:41.162 --> 20:43.320
Ever have déjà vu,
Mrs. Lancaster?

20:43.581 --> 20:46.202
I'll check with the kitchen.

20:46.500 --> 20:48.374
That's okay.
Thank you.

20:49.837 --> 20:52.507
Will you be checking out today?

20:54.800 --> 20:59.094
I'd say the chance
of departure is 80 percent.

21:00.306 --> 21:02.014
75-80.

21:07.230 --> 21:08.688
Excuse me!

21:09.482 --> 21:11.724
Excuse me.
Where's everybody going?

21:12.318 --> 21:13.777
To Gobbler's Knob.

21:13.986 --> 21:15.231
It's Groundhog Day.

21:16.072 --> 21:18.479
It's still just once a year,
isn't it?

21:30.795 --> 21:33.120
Phil Connors!
I thought that was you!

21:33.381 --> 21:35.623
My, oh my, Phil Connors!

21:35.883 --> 21:39.798
Don't say you don't remember me.
I sure as heckfire remember you.

21:40.012 --> 21:42.503
- Well?
- Ned Ryerson?

21:42.765 --> 21:46.099
Bing! First shot
right out of the box!

21:46.310 --> 21:48.932
So how's it going, old buddy?

21:49.230 --> 21:52.065
I'm not feeling well.
Would you excuse me?

21:52.316 --> 21:57.109
It's funny you should mention
your health. Guess what I do now.

21:57.363 --> 21:59.356
Do you sell insurance?

21:59.657 --> 22:02.492
Bing again!
You are sharp as a tack today!

22:02.743 --> 22:04.570
Do you have life insurance?

22:04.829 --> 22:07.118
If you do, you could
always use more.

22:07.373 --> 22:09.282
Right! I mean, who couldn't?

22:09.542 --> 22:10.870
But you want to know something?

22:11.127 --> 22:13.119
I gots a feeling...

22:13.629 --> 22:15.040
...you ain't got any.

22:15.298 --> 22:18.133
Am I right or am I right
or am I right?

22:18.342 --> 22:19.718
I got to go.

22:24.182 --> 22:28.131
Watch out for that first step.
It's a doozy!

22:52.126 --> 22:55.162
Phil! Over here!

22:57.340 --> 23:00.009
- Where have you been?
- Rita. Do me a favor.

23:00.218 --> 23:03.337
I need someone to give me a
good, hard slap in the face.

23:05.014 --> 23:06.425
How's that?

23:06.641 --> 23:07.471
Good!

23:07.975 --> 23:11.427
If you need help with the other cheek,
I'm right here.

23:13.105 --> 23:14.564
Something's going on.

23:14.857 --> 23:17.526
- Are you drunk or something?
- Drunk's more fun.

23:17.777 --> 23:19.769
Can I be serious with you
for a minute?

23:19.987 --> 23:21.102
Can you?

23:21.322 --> 23:23.149
I'm being serious!

23:23.407 --> 23:27.405
I'm having a problem.
I may be having a problem.

23:28.704 --> 23:29.867
It's groundhog time.

23:30.081 --> 23:32.323
See? I knew you'd say that!

23:32.750 --> 23:34.292
I really feel...

23:34.543 --> 23:35.954
...weird.

23:36.212 --> 23:38.501
Let's just do this.
Then we'll talk.

23:40.716 --> 23:42.294
All right, on me in three...

23:42.802 --> 23:44.344
...two, one.

23:44.971 --> 23:46.679
Well, it's Groundhog Day...

23:46.931 --> 23:48.259
...again...

23:48.516 --> 23:51.386
...and that must mean we're
up here at Gobbler's Knob...

23:51.644 --> 23:55.393
...waiting for the world's most famous
groundhog/weatherman...

23:55.606 --> 23:56.935
...Punxsutawney Phil...

23:57.191 --> 24:01.141
...who's about to tell us how much more
winter to expect.

24:06.867 --> 24:08.243
This is a riot!

24:11.789 --> 24:12.952
Isn't he cute?

24:14.083 --> 24:17.950
This February 2nd, at 7:20
and 30 seconds...

24:18.546 --> 24:21.879
...Punxsutawney Phil,
the seer of seers...

24:22.425 --> 24:24.963
...prognosticator of prognosticators...

24:25.469 --> 24:27.177
...emerged reluctantly...

24:27.430 --> 24:29.672
...but alertly in Punxsu...

24:32.184 --> 24:34.224
Oh, my gosh!

24:36.814 --> 24:38.807
I know there's a blizzard.

24:39.066 --> 24:42.151
When will the long-distance
lines be repaired?

24:44.030 --> 24:48.193
What if there is no tomorrow?
There wasn't one today.

25:45.299 --> 25:46.295
Morning!

25:46.551 --> 25:48.093
Off to see the groundhog?

25:54.684 --> 25:56.760
Did you sleep well, Mr...

26:11.242 --> 26:13.281
Phil Connors! I thought...

26:14.829 --> 26:18.079
Don't say you don't remember me.
I sure as heckfire remember you!

26:18.291 --> 26:20.367
It's me, Ned! Ryerson!

26:20.585 --> 26:23.076
Needlenose Ned! Ned the Head!

26:27.425 --> 26:29.998
Phil! Over here!

26:31.387 --> 26:34.341
Can I talk to you?
It's not work-related.

26:34.557 --> 26:37.474
- You never talk about work.
- We have to talk.

26:37.685 --> 26:40.805
- It's a creative meeting.
- We've got work to do!

26:41.022 --> 26:43.429
I don't.
I've already done it twice.

26:43.691 --> 26:46.645
When you get finished,
meet me in the diner.

26:49.113 --> 26:52.197
- What's that all about?
- I don't know.

26:52.450 --> 26:54.027
Prima donnas.

26:57.622 --> 26:58.617
More coffee?

26:58.831 --> 27:02.663
Just the check, please.
These sticky buns are heaven.

27:02.877 --> 27:04.371
Aren't they?

27:05.755 --> 27:08.210
Just put that anywhere, pal!

27:08.424 --> 27:10.002
Good save!

27:11.636 --> 27:14.969
Tell me why you're too sick to work.
It better be good.

27:17.183 --> 27:21.050
I'm reliving the same day
over and over.

27:21.437 --> 27:23.762
Groundhog Day. Today.

27:24.357 --> 27:27.523
Okay. I'm waiting for the punch line.

27:27.818 --> 27:30.689
Really! This is the third time!

27:30.947 --> 27:32.904
It's like yesterday never happened!

27:33.366 --> 27:37.114
I'm racking my brain trying to imagine
why you'd make this up.

27:38.037 --> 27:40.706
I'm not making it up.
I'm asking for help!

27:41.374 --> 27:43.247
What do you want me to do?

27:43.459 --> 27:46.793
I don't know! You're a producer.
Come up with something.

27:47.004 --> 27:49.626
You should get
your head examined...

27:49.882 --> 27:53.168
...if you expect me to believe
a stupid story like that!

27:53.469 --> 27:55.177
Phil? Like the groundhog Phil?

27:55.513 --> 27:58.086
Yeah. Like the groundhog Phil.

27:58.683 --> 28:00.925
Look out for your shadow, pal!

28:01.811 --> 28:03.720
Morons, your bus is leaving!

28:04.814 --> 28:08.432
You guys ready? We better go,
to stay ahead of the weather.

28:08.693 --> 28:13.236
- Let's talk about it in Pittsburgh.
- I'm not going back to Pittsburgh.

28:13.531 --> 28:15.737
- Why not?
- Because of the blizzard!

28:16.033 --> 28:18.441
You said it was going
to hit Altoona.

28:18.661 --> 28:21.330
I know that's what I said.

28:21.998 --> 28:24.037
I think you need help.

28:24.834 --> 28:27.918
That's what I've been saying.
I need help.

28:28.796 --> 28:30.540
No spots.

28:30.798 --> 28:33.254
No clots, no tumors.

28:33.509 --> 28:34.885
No lesions.

28:35.094 --> 28:36.672
No aneurisms.

28:36.929 --> 28:38.471
At least none that I can see.

28:38.723 --> 28:42.590
If you want a CAT scan or an MRI,
you'll have to go into Pittsburgh.

28:42.810 --> 28:45.017
I can't go into Pittsburgh.

28:45.271 --> 28:48.854
- Why can't you go into Pittsburgh?
- I told you, there's a blizzard.

28:49.066 --> 28:50.311
Right. The blizzard!

28:50.568 --> 28:53.237
You know what you may need,
Mr. Connors?

28:54.030 --> 28:55.358
A biopsy.

28:55.823 --> 28:57.614
A psychiatrist.

28:59.285 --> 29:01.823
That's an unusual problem...

29:02.079 --> 29:03.159
...Mr. Connors.

29:04.999 --> 29:09.661
Most of my work is with couples,
families. I have an alcoholic now.

29:12.006 --> 29:13.749
You went to college, right?

29:13.966 --> 29:16.291
It wasn't veterinary
psychology, was it?

29:16.552 --> 29:19.506
Didn't you take a course that
covered this stuff?

29:19.722 --> 29:22.213
Sort of, I guess.

29:23.893 --> 29:25.636
Abnormal psychology.

29:26.062 --> 29:28.019
So...

29:29.148 --> 29:30.429
...what do I do?

29:31.275 --> 29:32.604
We should meet again.

29:33.569 --> 29:35.562
How's tomorrow for you?

29:38.324 --> 29:39.699
Is that not good?

29:50.545 --> 29:53.332
I was in the Virgin Islands once.

29:53.589 --> 29:55.582
I met a girl.

29:55.800 --> 29:57.080
We ate lobster.

29:57.343 --> 29:59.336
Drank piña coladas.

29:59.595 --> 30:02.133
At sunset, we made love
like sea otters.

30:05.977 --> 30:08.302
That was a pretty good day.

30:08.562 --> 30:10.389
Why couldn't I get that day...

30:10.606 --> 30:11.721
...over...

30:11.941 --> 30:14.147
...and over and over?

30:14.443 --> 30:18.311
Some guys would look
at this glass and say:

30:18.531 --> 30:19.990
"That glass is half empty."

30:20.241 --> 30:24.025
Other guys would say,
"That glass is half full."

30:24.287 --> 30:27.620
I peg you as a "glass is half empty"
kind of guy. Right?

30:29.625 --> 30:32.959
What would you do if you were
stuck in one place...

30:33.212 --> 30:37.126
...and every day was exactly the same,
and nothing you did mattered?

30:39.719 --> 30:42.470
That about sums it up for me.

30:50.062 --> 30:51.058
Good luck.

30:51.314 --> 30:52.724
I'll drop you off.

30:54.901 --> 30:57.107
This thing sticks a little bit.

30:57.361 --> 30:58.855
You got to jiggle it...

30:59.113 --> 31:01.271
Come on up here, pal.

31:01.490 --> 31:03.946
Give me your keys, pal.
Give me the keys.

31:04.160 --> 31:06.912
Friends don't let friends drive, right?
Stand up here.

31:07.121 --> 31:10.075
Take a deep breath. You feel okay?

31:10.333 --> 31:11.708
You're all right.

31:18.216 --> 31:20.885
You want to throw up here
or in the car?

31:21.260 --> 31:23.798
I think, both.

31:34.982 --> 31:36.939
I don't think I should drive.

31:37.193 --> 31:39.067
I don't either.

31:39.320 --> 31:40.695
Watch your head.

31:40.905 --> 31:44.072
Watch your knees.
Don't break anything.

31:44.325 --> 31:46.448
Let's not forget seat belts.

31:48.412 --> 31:51.532
Who else could go for some
flapjacks right now?

31:56.796 --> 31:58.504
Let me ask you a question.

31:58.756 --> 31:59.621
Shoot.

32:01.133 --> 32:03.126
What if there were no tomorrow?

32:03.678 --> 32:06.963
No tomorrow? That means there'd be
no consequences...

32:07.223 --> 32:08.765
...no hangovers.

32:09.016 --> 32:11.472
We could do whatever we wanted!

32:12.895 --> 32:14.270
That's true.

32:14.480 --> 32:17.600
We could do whatever we want.

32:23.197 --> 32:26.732
If we wanted to hit mailboxes
we could let Ralph drive!

32:33.541 --> 32:35.119
They want you to stop.

32:35.334 --> 32:36.248
Hang on!

32:42.008 --> 32:44.000
It's the same thing
your whole life.

32:44.468 --> 32:47.386
"Clean up your room! Stand up
straight! Pick up your feet!

32:47.847 --> 32:49.389
Take it like a man!

32:49.599 --> 32:51.259
Be nice to your sister!

32:52.101 --> 32:54.592
Don't mix beer and wine, ever!

32:56.397 --> 32:58.603
Don't drive on the railroad tracks!"

33:00.192 --> 33:01.473
That's one I agree with.

33:11.078 --> 33:13.201
I don't know, Gus.

33:13.456 --> 33:16.208
Sometimes I think you just have to...

33:16.459 --> 33:18.831
...take the big chances.

33:19.253 --> 33:21.412
<i>This is the police! Pull over now!</i>

33:22.798 --> 33:25.005
We're talking in here!

33:30.181 --> 33:32.090
I bet he swerves first.

33:46.322 --> 33:49.608
I'm not going to live by
their rules anymore!

33:49.825 --> 33:51.450
I noticed that.

33:51.661 --> 33:54.199
You make choices
and you live with them.

34:08.928 --> 34:09.924
My knee!

34:12.806 --> 34:14.598
Let me handle this.

34:17.186 --> 34:19.938
Three cheeseburgers,
two large fries...

34:20.188 --> 34:22.181
...two chocolate shakes
and one large Coke.

34:22.483 --> 34:24.391
And some flapjacks!

34:24.652 --> 34:26.478
Too early for flapjacks?

34:40.042 --> 34:41.322
Yes!

34:42.545 --> 34:44.205
Rise and shine, campers!

34:44.463 --> 34:47.464
Don't forget your booties!
It's cold out there today!

34:47.717 --> 34:49.092
It's cold every day.

34:49.342 --> 34:52.428
What is this, Miami Beach?
Not hardly!

34:57.018 --> 34:58.428
Slept like a baby.

34:58.686 --> 35:00.678
I'd love some of your coffee.

35:00.938 --> 35:02.729
- I hope...
- Flurries moving in later...

35:02.940 --> 35:05.099
...but the blizzard's going to hit
outside of town.

35:05.359 --> 35:06.355
Mrs. Lancaster?

35:06.611 --> 35:08.899
Was anybody looking for me
here this morning?

35:09.155 --> 35:12.571
Perhaps a state official?
Maybe a blue hat, gun, nightstick?

35:12.783 --> 35:15.701
No, no one like that!
Will there be?

35:15.912 --> 35:17.572
Apparently not.

35:19.707 --> 35:23.076
Will you hold my room for me?
I'm staying an extra day.

35:28.925 --> 35:30.917
Catch you tomorrow, pops.

35:36.432 --> 35:38.638
- Phil Connors!
- Ned?

36:09.924 --> 36:13.340
I like to see a man of advancing years
throw caution to the wind.

36:13.553 --> 36:15.841
It's inspiring, in a way.

36:16.639 --> 36:19.094
My years are not advancing
as fast as you think.

36:19.767 --> 36:20.597
More coffee?

36:21.269 --> 36:22.431
Keep it coming.

36:22.770 --> 36:23.885
Sure thing.

36:25.731 --> 36:28.104
Just put that anywhere, pal!

36:28.484 --> 36:29.729
Good save!

36:31.821 --> 36:35.569
Don't you worry about cholesterol,
lung cancer, love handles?

36:37.910 --> 36:39.618
I don't worry anymore.

36:40.079 --> 36:42.368
What makes you special?
Everybody worries.

36:42.832 --> 36:45.453
That's exactly what makes me
so special.

36:45.668 --> 36:47.459
I don't even have to floss.

36:57.263 --> 36:58.128
What?

37:00.057 --> 37:03.723
"The wretch, concentered all in self

37:04.145 --> 37:06.470
"Living, shall forfeit fair renown

37:06.897 --> 37:09.815
"And doubly dying, shall go down

37:10.026 --> 37:13.027
"To the vile dust from whence he sprung

37:13.279 --> 37:14.654
"Unwept...

37:14.864 --> 37:17.319
"...unhonored and unsung"

37:17.950 --> 37:19.990
Sir Walter Scott.

37:23.122 --> 37:24.533
You don't like poetry?

37:25.291 --> 37:26.666
I love poetry!

37:26.876 --> 37:29.996
I just thought that was Willard Scott.
I was confused.

37:30.504 --> 37:32.960
You think I act like this
because I'm egocentric?

37:33.216 --> 37:36.382
You are egocentric.
It's your defining characteristic.

37:38.637 --> 37:42.303
You guys ready? We better go,
to stay ahead of the weather.

37:42.516 --> 37:43.382
Thanks, Larry.

37:43.643 --> 37:45.849
Would you like a doggie bag?

37:46.312 --> 37:47.723
I'll stay and finish.

37:47.938 --> 37:50.227
I thought you hated this town.

37:50.441 --> 37:52.315
It's beginning to grow on me.

37:53.653 --> 37:54.933
Larry, quit staring.

37:55.279 --> 37:58.150
- These are excellent.
- <i>Bon appétit.</i>

38:08.626 --> 38:10.868
You see the groundhog
this morning?

38:12.546 --> 38:14.207
I never miss it.

38:14.507 --> 38:16.084
What's your name?

38:17.968 --> 38:20.044
Nancy Taylor. And you are?

38:20.262 --> 38:22.801
- What high school did you go to?
- What?

38:23.015 --> 38:24.047
High school.

38:25.435 --> 38:28.008
Lincoln, in Pittsburgh.
Who are you?

38:28.229 --> 38:31.432
Who was your 12th grade
English teacher?

38:31.691 --> 38:33.066
Are you kidding?

38:33.317 --> 38:35.524
In 12th grade,
your English teacher was...

38:35.736 --> 38:37.645
Mrs. Walsh.

38:37.864 --> 38:40.900
Nancy. Lincoln. Walsh.

38:41.576 --> 38:43.615
Thanks very much.

38:58.718 --> 39:00.295
Nancy?

39:01.179 --> 39:03.634
Nancy Taylor!

39:04.140 --> 39:06.346
Lincoln High School!

39:06.767 --> 39:10.101
I sat next to you in
Mrs. Walsh's English class!

39:10.563 --> 39:13.848
- I'm sorry.
- Phil Connors!

39:15.193 --> 39:17.600
- That's amazing!
- You don't remember me?

39:20.406 --> 39:21.948
I asked you to the prom.

39:23.200 --> 39:24.944
Phil Connors?

39:25.494 --> 39:27.701
I was short and I've sprouted.

39:32.168 --> 39:33.828
How are you?

39:34.545 --> 39:35.576
Great.

39:35.838 --> 39:37.546
You look terrific!

39:37.840 --> 39:41.007
You look very, very terrific!

39:42.511 --> 39:44.919
Listen, I got to go do this report.

39:45.139 --> 39:46.384
Are you a reporter?

39:46.599 --> 39:49.090
A weatherman with
Channel 9, Pittsburgh.

39:49.352 --> 39:51.261
I should have known! That's great!

39:51.562 --> 39:53.222
But maybe later we could...

39:53.439 --> 39:54.684
Yeah, whatever!

39:55.024 --> 39:56.684
Stay right here.

39:57.109 --> 40:00.276
Promise me?
I'll be right back. Wish me luck!

40:00.530 --> 40:02.238
Good luck!

40:20.133 --> 40:21.413
Oh, Phil.

40:22.468 --> 40:23.843
Oh, Rita.

40:27.723 --> 40:28.921
Who's Rita?

40:29.433 --> 40:31.011
How should I know?

40:31.310 --> 40:33.848
What is this,
some kind of one-night stand?

40:34.105 --> 40:36.062
On the contrary, Nancy...

40:36.315 --> 40:39.565
...I love you.
I've always loved you.

40:40.361 --> 40:42.852
This is going to seem sudden but...

40:44.240 --> 40:46.233
...Nancy, will you be my wife?

40:53.124 --> 40:54.583
Rita.

40:55.418 --> 40:57.909
- Nancy.
- Whatever.

41:02.383 --> 41:04.589
A gust of wind.

41:06.512 --> 41:08.137
A dog barks.

41:09.473 --> 41:10.932
Cue the truck.

41:18.649 --> 41:19.847
Exit Herman.

41:20.568 --> 41:22.442
Walk on to the bank.

41:22.695 --> 41:26.740
Exit Felix, and stand there with a
not-so-bright look on your face.

41:28.659 --> 41:30.652
All right, Doris. Come on.

41:31.329 --> 41:34.246
Fix your bra, honey.
That's better.

41:35.249 --> 41:36.660
Felix!

41:36.917 --> 41:38.328
How you doing, Doris?

41:38.544 --> 41:41.118
Can I have a roll of quarters?

41:42.340 --> 41:46.966
Ten... nine... eight...

41:47.678 --> 41:49.007
...car...

41:49.221 --> 41:52.306
...six... five...

41:52.558 --> 41:54.681
...quarters...

41:55.061 --> 41:58.643
...three... two...

42:06.447 --> 42:07.610
Felix?

42:07.823 --> 42:11.406
- Did I bring out two bags or one?
- I don't know.

42:38.687 --> 42:41.226
I thought we were going
to a costume party.

42:41.482 --> 42:44.353
It's like I said, I love this film.

42:44.610 --> 42:46.817
I've seen it over 100 times.

42:47.071 --> 42:48.067
Phil!

42:48.322 --> 42:49.567
Told you...

42:49.824 --> 42:52.066
...call me "Bronco."

42:52.326 --> 42:54.118
Sorry, Bronco.

42:55.371 --> 42:57.031
Hi, Nancy.

43:01.252 --> 43:03.209
My own fiancée...

43:03.462 --> 43:05.585
...doesn't remember me.

43:08.718 --> 43:11.256
That'll be one adult and...

43:11.512 --> 43:14.762
- Two adults.
- Two adults, I guess.

43:17.560 --> 43:22.685
- <i>groundhog who, as legend has it,</i>
<i>can predict an early spring.</i>

43:22.899 --> 43:25.650
<i>The question we have</i>
<i>to ask ourselves today is:</i>

43:25.902 --> 43:27.859
<i>"Does Phil feel lucky?"</i>

43:28.071 --> 43:30.857
Rita, if you only
had one day to live...

43:31.115 --> 43:32.740
...what would you do?

43:32.992 --> 43:35.530
I don't know.
What are you dying of?

43:35.786 --> 43:40.247
No, the whole world
is about to explode.

43:40.458 --> 43:41.454
What do you do?

43:41.709 --> 43:43.998
I want to know
where to put the camera.

43:44.212 --> 43:46.702
What are you looking for?
A date for the weekend?

43:46.964 --> 43:49.799
No, I'm just interested in you.

43:50.051 --> 43:52.292
What do you want?
What do you like?

43:52.511 --> 43:54.385
What do you think about?

43:54.639 --> 43:56.927
What kind of men
are you interested in?

43:57.141 --> 43:58.968
What do you do for fun?

43:59.644 --> 44:02.894
Are you trying to
make me look like a fool?

44:03.105 --> 44:07.317
I'm trying to talk like normal people.
Isn't this how they talk?

44:07.526 --> 44:09.852
- Close.
- Okay, so talk to me.

44:10.112 --> 44:12.319
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.

44:14.617 --> 44:15.482
And a doughnut.

44:15.701 --> 44:17.326
All right.

44:19.705 --> 44:21.698
<i>So what do you want out of life?</i>

44:23.626 --> 44:25.868
I guess I want what everybody wants.

44:26.087 --> 44:29.622
Career, love, marriage, children.

44:30.049 --> 44:31.508
Are you seeing anyone?

44:32.009 --> 44:36.671
This is getting too personal.
I'm not ready to share this with you.

44:37.848 --> 44:40.090
How about you?
What do you want?

44:41.269 --> 44:44.554
What I really want
is someone like you.

44:44.814 --> 44:46.094
Oh, please!

44:46.357 --> 44:48.515
Why not? What are you looking for?

44:48.776 --> 44:50.104
Who's your perfect guy?

44:51.487 --> 44:55.485
First of all, he's too humble
to know he's perfect.

44:56.826 --> 44:58.201
That's me!

44:58.452 --> 45:01.786
He's intelligent,
supportive, funny...

45:02.039 --> 45:04.246
Intelligent, supportive, funny.

45:04.500 --> 45:07.834
Me, me, me.

45:08.087 --> 45:10.874
He's romantic and courageous.

45:11.132 --> 45:12.377
Me also.

45:12.967 --> 45:16.550
He's got a good body but doesn't
have to look in the mirror often.

45:17.221 --> 45:22.049
I have a great body, and sometimes
I go months without looking.

45:24.562 --> 45:28.061
He's kind, sensitive and gentle.

45:28.607 --> 45:30.434
He's not afraid to cry.

45:30.693 --> 45:33.266
This is a man
we're talking about, right?

45:33.529 --> 45:38.487
He likes animals, children,
and he'll change poopy diapers.

45:38.743 --> 45:41.115
Does he have to use the word "poopy"?

45:42.663 --> 45:46.114
He plays an instrument,
and he loves his mother.

45:47.376 --> 45:50.128
I am really close on this one.

45:50.922 --> 45:53.673
Really, really close.

45:58.137 --> 45:59.715
It's Phil Connors!

45:59.930 --> 46:01.211
Hello.

46:01.432 --> 46:03.259
Thanks for watching.

46:16.197 --> 46:19.364
What are the chances
of getting out today?

46:19.617 --> 46:21.859
Van won't start.
Larry's working on it.

46:22.119 --> 46:23.530
Wouldn't you know it?

46:23.788 --> 46:25.579
Can I buy you a drink?

46:28.209 --> 46:30.878
Jim Beam, ice, water.

46:31.712 --> 46:32.827
For you, miss?

46:33.297 --> 46:36.631
Sweet vermouth on the rocks
with a twist, please.

46:41.931 --> 46:44.173
What are the chances
of getting out today?

46:44.433 --> 46:46.841
Van won't start.
Larry's working on it.

46:47.103 --> 46:48.727
Wouldn't you know it?

46:48.938 --> 46:50.812
Can I buy you a drink?

46:53.693 --> 46:56.397
Sweet vermouth, rocks,
with a twist, please.

46:56.612 --> 46:57.478
For you, miss?

46:57.864 --> 46:59.358
The same.

47:00.199 --> 47:01.859
That's my favorite drink.

47:02.118 --> 47:03.861
Mine too!

47:04.120 --> 47:05.662
It makes me think of Rome.

47:05.913 --> 47:09.163
The way the sun hits
the buildings in the afternoon.

47:10.918 --> 47:12.911
What should we drink to?

47:14.171 --> 47:16.081
To the groundhog!

47:16.340 --> 47:18.962
I always drink to world peace.

47:27.894 --> 47:29.802
Can I buy you a drink?

47:32.732 --> 47:35.768
Sweet vermouth, rocks,
with a twist, please.

47:36.444 --> 47:38.152
For you, miss?

47:38.404 --> 47:40.064
The same.

47:40.698 --> 47:42.157
That's my favorite drink.

47:42.408 --> 47:43.986
Mine too!

47:45.202 --> 47:47.444
It makes me think of Rome.

47:47.705 --> 47:51.489
The way the sun hits
the buildings in the afternoon.

47:52.585 --> 47:54.412
What should we drink to?

47:56.464 --> 47:59.631
I'd like to say a prayer
and drink to world peace.

48:01.594 --> 48:03.385
To world peace.

48:13.439 --> 48:16.773
- This is wonderful!
- See? Didn't I tell you?

48:16.984 --> 48:19.024
How do you know so much
about Punxsutawney?

48:19.237 --> 48:21.644
I spent a lot of time here.

48:21.906 --> 48:23.945
Small-town people are
more real, down-to-earth.

48:24.200 --> 48:26.572
- That's how I feel!
- Really?

48:26.786 --> 48:29.906
- Some white chocolate?
- Yuck, don't make me sick.

48:30.164 --> 48:31.327
No white chocolate.

48:31.541 --> 48:34.458
There is something
so familiar about this.

48:34.710 --> 48:36.786
Do you ever have déjà vu?

48:37.046 --> 48:39.252
Didn't you just ask me that?

48:43.219 --> 48:46.802
People place too much
emphasis on their careers.

48:47.014 --> 48:50.181
I wish we could all live
in the mountains.

48:50.393 --> 48:52.931
That's where I see myself
in five years.

48:53.187 --> 48:54.101
How about you?

48:54.355 --> 48:57.190
I agree. I just like
to go with the flow.

48:57.400 --> 48:59.476
See where it leads me.

48:59.735 --> 49:01.562
Well, it's led you here.

49:03.322 --> 49:06.987
It's about a million miles
from where I started in college.

49:07.243 --> 49:10.742
You weren't in broadcasting
or journalism?

49:11.831 --> 49:15.959
Believe it or not, I studied
19th-century French poetry.

49:16.252 --> 49:17.829
What a waste of time!

49:18.045 --> 49:20.999
I mean, for someone else
that'd be a total waste.

49:21.257 --> 49:23.297
So bold of you to choose that.

49:23.551 --> 49:27.216
It's incredible.
You must be a very strong person.

49:28.973 --> 49:32.472
People place too much
emphasis on their careers.

49:32.727 --> 49:37.270
I wish we could all
live in the mountains.

49:37.523 --> 49:39.765
That's where I see myself
in five years.

49:39.984 --> 49:40.980
How about you?

49:41.235 --> 49:45.150
I agree. I like to go
with the flow, see what happens.

49:45.406 --> 49:47.695
Well, it's gotten you here.

49:48.242 --> 49:51.445
It's a million miles
from where I started in college.

49:51.704 --> 49:55.156
You weren't in broadcasting
or journalism or anything like that?

49:56.292 --> 50:00.372
Believe it or not, I studied
19th-century French poetry.

50:17.313 --> 50:18.593
You speak French!

50:24.445 --> 50:27.114
I haven't done this since I was a kid.

50:27.364 --> 50:29.156
Me neither. It's fun!

50:29.617 --> 50:30.482
Clean fun.

50:33.371 --> 50:36.870
I hope one day I can do this
with my own children.

50:40.294 --> 50:42.536
Where'd you get that?

50:42.797 --> 50:45.418
Well, I went over
to the snowman shop.

50:47.260 --> 50:48.802
Hey, an assassin!

50:49.261 --> 50:50.839
I'll protect you!

50:51.347 --> 50:54.099
I shall die for you.
You shall not take her!

50:54.308 --> 50:55.589
Find cover!

50:57.937 --> 51:00.262
I'm getting some good ones.

51:00.481 --> 51:03.352
That's a boy! Good try.

51:03.567 --> 51:05.228
Help me!

52:01.208 --> 52:02.371
What?

52:02.627 --> 52:06.671
I'm just amazed,
and I'm not easily amazed.

52:06.922 --> 52:08.333
About what?

52:08.591 --> 52:11.343
How you can start a day with one
kind of expectation...

52:11.552 --> 52:13.628
...and end up
so completely different.

52:15.056 --> 52:18.222
Do you like the way
this day is turning out?

52:18.434 --> 52:20.842
I like it very much.

52:21.104 --> 52:24.603
It's a perfect day.
You couldn't plan a day like this.

52:24.857 --> 52:26.102
Well, you can.

52:26.317 --> 52:29.318
It just takes an awful lot of work.

52:29.570 --> 52:31.777
Come in.
I want to show you something.

52:31.989 --> 52:34.278
- I don't think I should.
- I agree.

52:34.533 --> 52:38.863
That's why I want to show you one thing,
then kick you right out.

52:47.046 --> 52:49.288
It's just lovely.

52:59.684 --> 53:02.435
Would you like to sit
and stare at the fake fire?

53:07.108 --> 53:09.314
It's a really wonderful room.

53:09.569 --> 53:11.395
It is now.

53:18.327 --> 53:20.783
I don't think we should do this.

53:21.038 --> 53:22.663
I don't either.

53:25.376 --> 53:28.081
On second thought,
I think we should.

53:28.921 --> 53:32.088
It's the perfect end
to a perfect day.

53:32.675 --> 53:35.593
Well, it's a little fast for me.

53:35.845 --> 53:37.256
Me too.

53:37.722 --> 53:39.963
Maybe I should go.

53:40.183 --> 53:42.092
Where would you go?

53:42.351 --> 53:43.727
Why?

53:43.936 --> 53:46.225
We've got a perfect fire.

53:46.522 --> 53:49.559
I've got some French poetry here.
Baudelaire...

53:51.110 --> 53:52.604
I will read to you.

53:53.362 --> 53:57.490
I've got some ice cream on
the windowsill. Hold on a minute.

54:03.122 --> 54:04.153
Rocky road.

54:04.415 --> 54:05.957
I love rocky road.

54:06.208 --> 54:08.118
Yeah, I thought so.

54:08.419 --> 54:10.127
You have to stay.

54:10.379 --> 54:14.163
No, really, I'm tired.
We can see each other tomorrow.

54:14.425 --> 54:18.174
No, tonight.
It's got to be tonight.

54:18.387 --> 54:21.258
No, Phil, really.

54:22.183 --> 54:25.433
Just stay for a while and
if you like it, stay longer.

54:25.645 --> 54:27.768
And if you like that, stay longer.

54:27.980 --> 54:29.854
Let's not spoil it, okay?

54:30.107 --> 54:32.515
I don't want to spoil it either.

54:32.735 --> 54:35.653
You know I can't stay with you.

54:35.905 --> 54:38.989
Why not? I love you.

54:41.035 --> 54:43.158
You love me?

54:43.412 --> 54:47.541
- You don't even know me.
- I know you.

54:49.085 --> 54:52.039
Oh, no. I can't believe
I fell for this!

54:52.296 --> 54:54.668
This whole day has been
one long setup.

54:54.924 --> 54:55.873
No, it hasn't.

54:56.133 --> 54:58.885
And I hate fudge. Yuck!

54:59.178 --> 55:01.218
No white chocolate, no fudge.

55:01.806 --> 55:05.222
What are you doing?
Are you making some kind of list?

55:05.434 --> 55:08.637
Did you call my friends
and ask them what I like?

55:08.896 --> 55:12.395
- Is this what love is for you?
- This is real. This is love.

55:12.608 --> 55:14.067
Stop saying that!

55:14.694 --> 55:16.236
You must be crazy.

55:16.487 --> 55:20.188
I could never love you because
you'll never love anyone but yourself.

55:20.741 --> 55:24.324
I don't even like myself.
Give me another chance.

55:25.997 --> 55:28.618
That's for making me
care about you.

55:35.590 --> 55:38.045
I haven't done this
since I was a kid.

55:38.301 --> 55:39.296
It's fun!

55:39.510 --> 55:43.839
And good, clean fun too.
That's what's missing in the world.

55:44.098 --> 55:46.803
I can't wait to do this
with my own children.

55:47.018 --> 55:48.560
I want lots of kids!

55:48.811 --> 55:52.643
I want to adopt, I want my own kids,
I want to have foster kids.

55:52.898 --> 55:55.140
I got this at Snowman City.

55:55.401 --> 55:58.236
Hey! Some kid just
threw a snowball at us.

55:58.488 --> 56:01.322
Come here! Let's have some fun!

56:03.534 --> 56:06.321
I wish these were my own kids.

56:08.956 --> 56:11.578
Are any of you up for adoption?

56:12.293 --> 56:14.701
Here's a humdinger over here!

56:14.962 --> 56:17.002
Wasn't that great?

56:25.431 --> 56:27.055
Stop it!

57:11.853 --> 57:13.845
Phil! Over here!

57:16.232 --> 57:18.853
Where have you been?
You're missing the fun.

57:19.110 --> 57:20.983
Phil, you look terrible.

57:21.654 --> 57:24.145
What happened? Rough night?

57:42.383 --> 57:44.043
Okay, campers.

57:44.468 --> 57:46.295
Rise and shine.

57:48.222 --> 57:51.887
Don't forget your booties,
because it's cold out there.

57:52.810 --> 57:55.218
It's cold out there every day.

57:55.938 --> 57:59.770
<i>This country's largest lake,</i>
<i>Chapala, is located near Guadalajara.</i>

58:00.943 --> 58:02.022
What is Mexico?

58:02.236 --> 58:03.267
<i>What is Mexico?</i>

58:03.613 --> 58:05.439
- <i>Correct.</i>
- <i>Lakes and Rivers, 400.</i>

58:05.698 --> 58:08.367
<i>Seneca is the largest</i>
<i>of these lakes.</i>

58:09.035 --> 58:10.529
What are the Finger Lakes?

58:10.745 --> 58:13.699
- <i>What are the Finger Lakes?</i>
- <i>Correct.</i>

58:13.914 --> 58:18.078
- <i>This lake in Bolivia...</i>
- What is Titicaca?

58:18.335 --> 58:20.079
- <i>What is Titicaca?</i>
- <i>Correct.</i>

58:20.296 --> 58:21.245
For 1,000.

58:21.464 --> 58:23.373
- <i>Milky-colored...</i>
- The Rhone.

58:23.633 --> 58:25.257
<i>...when entering Lake Geneva...</i>

58:25.510 --> 58:28.048
<i>...this river is</i>
<i>clear blue upon exiting.</i>

58:28.262 --> 58:29.211
- <i>Jim?</i>
- <i>The Rhone.</i>

58:29.472 --> 58:30.800
<i>Good for $1, 000.</i>

58:31.057 --> 58:33.464
<i>You're $500 off the lead right now.</i>

58:36.270 --> 58:37.930
This is pitiful.

58:38.272 --> 58:39.683
A thousand people...

58:39.941 --> 58:42.941
...freezing their butts off,
waiting to worship a rat.

58:43.152 --> 58:44.730
What a hype.

58:45.405 --> 58:49.449
They used to pull the hog out,
and they used to eat it.

58:49.658 --> 58:52.779
You're hypocrites! All of you!

58:55.081 --> 58:56.623
You got a problem, Larry?

58:58.084 --> 58:58.914
Untie your tongue.

58:59.126 --> 59:01.499
Come here and talk.
Am I upsetting you...

59:01.712 --> 59:02.910
...princess?

59:03.130 --> 59:04.922
You want a prediction
about the weather?

59:05.174 --> 59:07.843
You're asking the wrong Phil.

59:08.094 --> 59:10.763
I'll give you a winter prediction.

59:11.013 --> 59:13.053
It's going to be cold.

59:13.307 --> 59:15.514
It's going to be gray.

59:15.726 --> 59:20.519
And it's going to last you
for the rest of your life.

59:55.349 --> 59:59.098
Once again the eyes of the nation
have turned here...

59:59.604 --> 01:00:02.854
...to this tiny village
in Western Pennsylvania.

01:00:03.065 --> 01:00:05.983
There is no way that this winter...

01:00:06.235 --> 01:00:09.106
...is ever going to end...

01:00:09.322 --> 01:00:13.271
...as long as this groundhog
keeps seeing his shadow.

01:00:13.534 --> 01:00:15.408
I don't see any other way out.

01:00:16.203 --> 01:00:18.077
He's got to be stopped.

01:00:19.582 --> 01:00:20.957
And I have to stop it.

01:00:23.502 --> 01:00:24.333
Real good, Phil.

01:00:24.587 --> 01:00:25.832
Real good.

01:00:27.423 --> 01:00:29.001
He's out of his gourd.

01:00:33.679 --> 01:00:37.048
I'm worried. There's something
really wrong with Phil.

01:00:37.308 --> 01:00:39.977
There's a lot of things
wrong with Phil.

01:00:42.146 --> 01:00:43.391
Hi, Phil.

01:00:43.814 --> 01:00:45.937
I've come to the end of me.

01:00:46.192 --> 01:00:48.315
There's no way out now.

01:00:49.779 --> 01:00:53.112
Just remember, we had
a beautiful day together once.

01:00:56.536 --> 01:00:57.946
All right, little fellow.

01:00:58.204 --> 01:01:01.573
Good job. He just smiled at me!
Did you see that?

01:01:01.832 --> 01:01:03.327
I believe he did.

01:01:04.251 --> 01:01:07.087
Okay, little fellow.
There you go.

01:01:09.090 --> 01:01:11.462
Hi, there. Something I can
do you for?

01:01:14.053 --> 01:01:15.962
Hey! What are you doing?

01:01:20.726 --> 01:01:22.766
Get the word out.
Somebody kidnapped Phil!

01:01:23.145 --> 01:01:24.474
We are going after him!

01:01:31.154 --> 01:01:33.561
Why would anybody steal a groundhog?

01:01:34.031 --> 01:01:35.858
I could think of reasons.

01:01:36.075 --> 01:01:37.024
Pervert.

01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:04.852
He must have just snapped!

01:02:05.062 --> 01:02:06.391
This ought to be good.

01:02:08.774 --> 01:02:10.019
What is he doing?

01:02:10.234 --> 01:02:11.776
What can he be thinking?

01:02:12.445 --> 01:02:14.022
Not bad for a quadruped.

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:18.194
Check your mirrors. Side of your eye.
Side of your eye.

01:02:24.248 --> 01:02:25.742
That's it.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.036
Hey, they're chasing us!
Come on, make it fun.

01:02:37.261 --> 01:02:38.424
Don't drive angry.

01:02:38.638 --> 01:02:39.836
Don't drive angry.

01:02:59.867 --> 01:03:02.738
There's no way out
except the way we came in!

01:03:02.995 --> 01:03:04.454
We got him now!

01:03:23.766 --> 01:03:24.964
What is he doing?

01:03:25.226 --> 01:03:26.222
I don't know.

01:03:30.564 --> 01:03:33.352
If you got to shoot,
don't hit the groundhog.

01:03:38.156 --> 01:03:39.899
Mustn't keep them waiting.

01:03:43.244 --> 01:03:44.572
It's showtime.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.240
On me in three...

01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:55.210
...two...

01:03:57.133 --> 01:03:58.082
...one.

01:04:11.897 --> 01:04:12.929
Phil!

01:04:15.276 --> 01:04:16.651
He might be okay.

01:04:21.282 --> 01:04:23.820
Well, no. Probably not now.

01:04:39.467 --> 01:04:40.712
Nuts.

01:04:48.643 --> 01:04:51.560
Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

01:04:52.605 --> 01:04:54.265
Would you like...

01:04:54.899 --> 01:04:56.310
...some toast?

01:05:14.668 --> 01:05:16.744
Oh, my God!

01:05:49.328 --> 01:05:50.704
That's him.

01:05:53.875 --> 01:05:57.290
He was a really, really great guy.

01:05:57.545 --> 01:05:59.253
I really, really liked him...

01:05:59.672 --> 01:06:00.703
...a lot.

01:06:08.055 --> 01:06:10.048
I'm sorry?
What was that again?

01:06:10.474 --> 01:06:13.226
- I'm a god.
- You're God?

01:06:13.436 --> 01:06:16.686
I'm a god. I'm not the god,
I don't think.

01:06:17.273 --> 01:06:19.396
Because you survived a car wreck?

01:06:19.608 --> 01:06:20.771
You folks ready to order?

01:06:21.027 --> 01:06:24.230
I didn't just survive a wreck.
I wasn't just blown up.

01:06:24.655 --> 01:06:27.229
I have been stabbed,
shot, poisoned...

01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:30.783
...frozen, hung, electrocuted
and burned.

01:06:30.995 --> 01:06:32.323
Oh, really.

01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:36.791
Every morning I wake up without a
scratch, not a dent in the fender.

01:06:37.501 --> 01:06:38.581
I am an immortal.

01:06:38.794 --> 01:06:41.416
Special today is blueberry waffles.

01:06:41.631 --> 01:06:43.457
Why are you telling me this?

01:06:43.758 --> 01:06:45.881
Because I want you to believe in me.

01:06:46.093 --> 01:06:47.422
You are not a god.

01:06:47.637 --> 01:06:51.052
Take my word. It's 12 years
of Catholic school talking.

01:06:51.599 --> 01:06:53.556
I can come back if you're not ready.

01:06:53.768 --> 01:06:55.760
How do you know I'm not a god?

01:06:55.978 --> 01:06:57.223
Please.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:59.805
- How do you know?
- It's not possible.

01:07:00.024 --> 01:07:01.767
I'll come back.

01:07:02.109 --> 01:07:03.354
Doris.

01:07:06.781 --> 01:07:09.354
This is Doris.
Her brother-in-law owns this diner.

01:07:09.617 --> 01:07:13.282
She's worked here since she was 17.
She wants to see Paris...

01:07:13.496 --> 01:07:14.694
...before she dies.

01:07:14.914 --> 01:07:15.863
Boy, would I!

01:07:16.082 --> 01:07:18.751
- What are you doing?
- Debbie and her fiancé.

01:07:19.001 --> 01:07:20.246
Do I know you?

01:07:20.461 --> 01:07:23.332
They're supposed to get married.
She's having second thoughts.

01:07:23.589 --> 01:07:24.752
What?

01:07:25.007 --> 01:07:26.122
Lovely ring.

01:07:26.384 --> 01:07:31.211
Bill's been a waiter three years,
since he left Penn State to work.

01:07:31.472 --> 01:07:34.556
He likes the town,
paints toy soldiers, and he's gay.

01:07:34.767 --> 01:07:35.798
I am.

01:07:36.436 --> 01:07:39.187
Gus hates it here,
wishes he'd stayed in the Navy.

01:07:39.438 --> 01:07:41.976
I could've retired
on half pay after 20 years.

01:07:42.233 --> 01:07:44.060
Excuse me. Is this a trick?

01:07:44.318 --> 01:07:48.150
Maybe the real God uses tricks.
Maybe he's not omnipotent...

01:07:48.406 --> 01:07:50.315
...he just knows everything.

01:07:50.574 --> 01:07:51.903
- Who's that?
- Tom.

01:07:52.159 --> 01:07:54.152
He worked in the coal mine
till it closed.

01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:55.533
- And her?
- Alice.

01:07:55.788 --> 01:07:58.326
Came from Ireland when she
was a baby. Lived in Erie.

01:07:58.583 --> 01:07:59.413
He's right.

01:07:59.625 --> 01:08:01.036
- And her?
- Nancy.

01:08:01.293 --> 01:08:05.243
Works in a shop, makes noises like
a chipmunk when she gets excited.

01:08:05.506 --> 01:08:07.214
- It's true.
- How do you know this?

01:08:07.466 --> 01:08:09.174
I told you, I know everything.

01:08:09.427 --> 01:08:12.297
In five seconds, a waiter
will drop a tray.

01:08:12.513 --> 01:08:15.265
- Five, four, three, two, one.
- This is nuts.

01:08:17.602 --> 01:08:20.009
- Okay?
- Okay, that's enough.

01:08:21.063 --> 01:08:23.270
What about me?
Do you know me too?

01:08:23.524 --> 01:08:27.736
I know all about you. You hope
for more than Channel 9 Pittsburgh.

01:08:27.944 --> 01:08:30.353
Well, everyone knows that.

01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:33.313
You like boats but not the ocean.

01:08:33.743 --> 01:08:37.112
You go to a lake in the summer
with your family.

01:08:37.372 --> 01:08:41.286
There's a dock and a boathouse
with boards missing from the roof...

01:08:42.001 --> 01:08:44.917
...and a place you used to
crawl underneath to be alone.

01:08:45.546 --> 01:08:48.796
You're a sucker for
French poetry and rhinestones.

01:08:49.508 --> 01:08:50.919
You're very generous.

01:08:51.176 --> 01:08:53.667
You're kind to strangers
and children.

01:08:54.221 --> 01:08:57.057
When you stand in the snow
you look like an angel.

01:08:57.515 --> 01:08:59.059
How are you doing this?

01:09:00.144 --> 01:09:03.098
I told you. I wake up every day.

01:09:03.354 --> 01:09:05.015
Right here.

01:09:05.232 --> 01:09:08.648
Right in Punxsutawney.
And it's always February 2nd.

01:09:09.654 --> 01:09:12.145
And there's nothing
I can do about it.

01:09:12.865 --> 01:09:15.950
If you still can't believe me, listen:

01:09:16.202 --> 01:09:18.194
In 10 seconds...

01:09:18.703 --> 01:09:22.156
...Larry is going to come
and take you away from me.

01:09:22.416 --> 01:09:24.243
But you can't let him.

01:09:25.252 --> 01:09:28.288
Please believe me.
You've got to believe me.

01:09:33.386 --> 01:09:37.383
You guys ready? We better go,
to stay ahead of the weather.

01:09:38.015 --> 01:09:39.260
What's that?

01:09:40.184 --> 01:09:42.591
"...to stay ahead of the weather."

01:09:48.108 --> 01:09:52.189
Maybe it really is happening.
How else could you know so much?

01:09:52.404 --> 01:09:54.895
There is no way.
I'm not that smart.

01:09:56.033 --> 01:09:58.275
Maybe I should
spend the day with you...

01:09:58.536 --> 01:10:01.987
...as an objective witness,
just to see what happens.

01:10:02.248 --> 01:10:04.703
This sounds like a science project.

01:10:05.834 --> 01:10:07.033
Concentrate.

01:10:07.294 --> 01:10:09.086
You got to want it.

01:10:09.547 --> 01:10:11.623
You got to want it, Rita.

01:10:12.091 --> 01:10:15.958
Come on. It's more
in the wrist than the fingers.

01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:26.097
Be the hat. Come on, go.

01:10:26.355 --> 01:10:29.310
- It'd take me a year to get good.
- Six months.

01:10:29.567 --> 01:10:32.817
Four to five hours a day,
and you'd be an expert.

01:10:33.321 --> 01:10:36.939
- Is this what you do with eternity?
- Now you know.

01:10:38.367 --> 01:10:40.407
That's not the worst part.

01:10:40.661 --> 01:10:42.072
What's the worst part?

01:10:42.330 --> 01:10:44.322
The worst part is that...

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:47.078
...tomorrow you'll have
forgotten all about this...

01:10:47.334 --> 01:10:49.541
...and you'll treat me
like a jerk again.

01:10:50.671 --> 01:10:52.130
I am a jerk.

01:10:52.339 --> 01:10:54.166
No, you're not.

01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:59.046
It doesn't make any difference.
I've killed myself so many times...

01:10:59.305 --> 01:11:01.013
...I don't even exist anymore.

01:11:01.599 --> 01:11:04.351
Sometimes I wish I had
a thousand lifetimes.

01:11:04.936 --> 01:11:07.937
I don't know.
Maybe it's not a curse.

01:11:08.189 --> 01:11:10.810
It just depends
on how you look at it.

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:14.566
Gosh, you're an upbeat lady!

01:11:17.865 --> 01:11:21.032
I want you to know it's been
a really nice day for me.

01:11:21.285 --> 01:11:22.150
Me too.

01:11:22.370 --> 01:11:23.568
And maybe...

01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:27.494
...if it's not too boring,
we can do it again sometime.

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:29.161
I hope so.

01:11:41.347 --> 01:11:43.138
You're still here?

01:11:45.518 --> 01:11:48.353
I thought you were supposed
to disappear. Or I was.

01:11:48.604 --> 01:11:50.264
Not until 6.

01:11:51.148 --> 01:11:52.559
You rat!

01:11:52.817 --> 01:11:54.644
I never said midnight.

01:11:54.986 --> 01:11:57.441
You knew I was waiting for midnight.

01:11:58.239 --> 01:11:59.650
Are you going to leave?

01:12:03.453 --> 01:12:04.567
Good.

01:12:15.256 --> 01:12:16.916
I'm sorry.

01:12:18.426 --> 01:12:20.667
It's all right.
You can fall asleep.

01:12:21.679 --> 01:12:24.004
I promise I won't touch you.

01:12:24.724 --> 01:12:25.969
Much.

01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:30.062
It's all right. I'm not tired.

01:12:30.896 --> 01:12:32.556
What were you saying?

01:12:33.983 --> 01:12:37.269
I think the last thing
that you heard was...

01:12:37.528 --> 01:12:40.197
...only God could make a tree.

01:12:40.448 --> 01:12:41.527
Really?

01:13:19.695 --> 01:13:21.984
What I wanted to say was...

01:13:23.741 --> 01:13:25.864
...I think you are the kindest...

01:13:26.118 --> 01:13:28.656
...sweetest, prettiest person...

01:13:29.163 --> 01:13:31.156
...I've ever met in my life.

01:13:32.708 --> 01:13:34.915
I've never seen anyone...

01:13:35.544 --> 01:13:38.036
...that's nicer to people
than you are.

01:13:51.018 --> 01:13:53.058
And the first time I saw you...

01:13:54.146 --> 01:13:56.388
...something happened to me.

01:13:57.650 --> 01:13:59.773
I never told you...

01:14:03.155 --> 01:14:05.563
...but I knew I wanted
to hold you...

01:14:05.783 --> 01:14:07.657
...as hard as I could.

01:14:20.631 --> 01:14:23.087
I don't deserve someone like you.

01:14:26.929 --> 01:14:28.721
But if I ever could...

01:14:30.182 --> 01:14:32.259
...I swear I would love you...

01:14:32.643 --> 01:14:34.766
...for the rest of my life.

01:14:39.358 --> 01:14:41.232
Did you say something?

01:14:46.949 --> 01:14:48.527
Good night, Rita.

01:14:49.744 --> 01:14:51.321
Good night, Phil.

01:15:16.270 --> 01:15:19.604
<i>Campers, rise and shine!</i>
<i>Don't forget your booties.</i>

01:15:19.815 --> 01:15:22.852
- <i>It's cold out there!</i>
- <i>It's cold every day.</i>

01:15:23.069 --> 01:15:25.357
- <i>Is this Miami Beach?</i>
- <i>Not hardly!</i>

01:16:00.773 --> 01:16:03.229
Who wants coffee?
Get it while it's hot.

01:16:04.110 --> 01:16:05.272
Thanks, Phil.

01:16:05.486 --> 01:16:06.316
Larry?

01:16:06.570 --> 01:16:08.646
Skim milk, two sugar.

01:16:08.906 --> 01:16:10.234
Thanks, Phil.

01:16:10.449 --> 01:16:11.612
Pastry?

01:16:11.867 --> 01:16:13.030
We're setting up.

01:16:13.244 --> 01:16:15.035
Pastry, Larry?
Take your pick.

01:16:16.289 --> 01:16:18.328
Thanks. Raspberry. Great.

01:16:18.833 --> 01:16:22.000
I talked with Buster Green,
the head groundhog honcho.

01:16:22.253 --> 01:16:25.040
He said if we set up here
we'll get a better shot.

01:16:25.506 --> 01:16:27.748
- What do you think?
- Sounds good.

01:16:28.092 --> 01:16:29.290
Larry?

01:16:30.594 --> 01:16:32.503
Yeah. Let's go for it.

01:16:32.763 --> 01:16:33.795
Good work, Phil.

01:16:34.474 --> 01:16:37.807
Maybe we'll get lucky.
Let me give you a hand.

01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:42.187
No, no. You got your coffee.
I'll get it.

01:16:43.482 --> 01:16:45.356
We never talk.
Do you have kids?

01:17:20.144 --> 01:17:21.971
I'd like a piano lesson.

01:17:22.313 --> 01:17:26.263
I'm with a student. But if you
want to come back tomorrow...

01:17:26.484 --> 01:17:29.734
I kind of want to get started.
I can give you $1,000.

01:17:32.489 --> 01:17:33.403
Come on in.

01:17:52.968 --> 01:17:55.008
Morning!
Off to see the groundhog?

01:17:55.221 --> 01:17:57.260
<i>Buon giorno, signore!</i>

01:17:58.266 --> 01:18:00.721
Think it'll be an early spring?

01:18:00.977 --> 01:18:03.349
"Winter, slumbering in the open air

01:18:03.604 --> 01:18:05.229
Wears on his smiling face...

01:18:05.481 --> 01:18:07.687
...a dream of spring"

01:18:07.941 --> 01:18:08.973
Ciao!

01:18:10.277 --> 01:18:11.476
Ciao!

01:18:49.609 --> 01:18:50.854
How does she look?

01:18:51.152 --> 01:18:52.231
Great.

01:18:52.737 --> 01:18:53.650
Thank you.

01:18:53.863 --> 01:18:57.314
Did you know he could ice sculpt?

01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:14.583
Not bad. You say
this is your first lesson?

01:19:15.551 --> 01:19:18.801
Yes, but my father
was a piano mover, so...

01:19:24.727 --> 01:19:29.223
- Phil Connors, I thought it was you.
- Ned Ryerson.

01:19:30.941 --> 01:19:33.479
I have missed you so much.

01:19:37.865 --> 01:19:41.400
I don't know where you're headed,
but can you call in sick?

01:19:44.831 --> 01:19:46.740
I got to get going.

01:19:47.625 --> 01:19:49.665
It's good to see you, Phil.

01:20:07.770 --> 01:20:09.229
Hello, father.

01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:11.688
Let's get you someplace warm.

01:20:13.526 --> 01:20:14.901
Remember me?

01:20:21.742 --> 01:20:23.450
You brought the old man in?

01:20:23.661 --> 01:20:24.692
How is he?

01:20:25.413 --> 01:20:27.405
He just passed away.

01:20:29.166 --> 01:20:32.203
- What did he die of?
- He was just old.

01:20:32.461 --> 01:20:34.288
It was just his time.

01:20:37.049 --> 01:20:40.050
- I want to see his chart. Excuse me.
- Sir!

01:20:40.428 --> 01:20:42.052
You can't come in here.

01:20:42.304 --> 01:20:44.926
Sir, this is a restricted area.

01:20:54.108 --> 01:20:55.768
Where's the chart?

01:20:56.277 --> 01:20:58.602
Sometimes people just die.

01:20:59.530 --> 01:21:00.989
Not today.

01:21:13.377 --> 01:21:15.583
Gets hard down there at the bottom.

01:21:18.507 --> 01:21:19.706
Here you go.

01:21:20.051 --> 01:21:21.165
Thank you.

01:21:25.598 --> 01:21:26.677
Come on, dad.

01:21:26.933 --> 01:21:28.308
Come on, pop.

01:21:30.269 --> 01:21:32.061
Come on. Come on, breathe.

01:21:32.312 --> 01:21:34.982
Breathe, pop! Breathe, pop!

01:22:00.716 --> 01:22:03.386
When Chekhov saw the long winter...

01:22:03.844 --> 01:22:07.213
...he saw a winter bleak
and dark and bereft of hope.

01:22:07.473 --> 01:22:12.135
Yet we know winter is just
another step in the cycle of life.

01:22:12.395 --> 01:22:16.060
But standing here among
the people of Punxsutawney...

01:22:16.315 --> 01:22:19.102
...and basking in the warmth
of their hearths and hearts...

01:22:20.194 --> 01:22:22.483
...I couldn't imagine a better fate...

01:22:22.697 --> 01:22:25.651
...than a long and lustrous winter.

01:22:25.908 --> 01:22:28.695
From Punxsutawney, it's Phil Connors.

01:22:28.953 --> 01:22:30.233
So long.

01:22:32.123 --> 01:22:33.831
Nice speech. Very nice.

01:22:34.083 --> 01:22:35.246
Thank you.

01:22:36.585 --> 01:22:39.836
- How was that for you two?
- My man, you touched me.

01:22:40.089 --> 01:22:41.749
- Thanks, Larry.
- Thank you.

01:22:43.134 --> 01:22:44.047
I got to go.

01:22:45.636 --> 01:22:49.681
That was surprising.
I didn't know you were so versatile.

01:22:49.932 --> 01:22:51.592
I surprise myself sometimes.

01:22:51.809 --> 01:22:53.802
Would you like a cup of coffee?

01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:57.970
I'd love to. Can I have a rain check?
I've got some errands.

01:23:01.736 --> 01:23:03.645
Errands? What errands?

01:23:03.905 --> 01:23:06.111
I thought we were going back.

01:23:23.758 --> 01:23:26.593
What do you say?
What do you say?

01:23:26.802 --> 01:23:29.673
You little brat.
You have never thanked me!

01:23:30.389 --> 01:23:32.014
I'll see you tomorrow...

01:23:32.266 --> 01:23:33.345
...maybe.

01:23:41.067 --> 01:23:43.392
You totaled it.

01:23:43.611 --> 01:23:47.739
- It's only a flat tire.
- What are we going to do?

01:23:49.116 --> 01:23:52.532
- It's an earthquake!
- It's not an earthquake.

01:23:52.745 --> 01:23:53.741
What is it?

01:23:57.333 --> 01:23:59.409
Thank you, young man.

01:24:00.544 --> 01:24:02.916
It's nothing.
I had the tire and the jack.

01:24:03.172 --> 01:24:05.793
Just be comfortable.
It'll be a minute.

01:24:06.050 --> 01:24:07.248
Who is that?

01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:10.261
He must be from the motor club.

01:24:11.514 --> 01:24:14.183
He's having a heart attack!
Do something!

01:24:14.434 --> 01:24:18.513
Call 411, an ambulance, a lawyer,
doctor, anything!

01:24:25.778 --> 01:24:27.320
I think that did it.

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:34.071
If you're going to eat steak,
get sharper teeth.

01:24:34.328 --> 01:24:36.653
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

01:24:37.248 --> 01:24:38.576
Who was that?

01:24:38.791 --> 01:24:41.496
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

01:24:41.752 --> 01:24:42.618
Eat, eat!

01:24:47.049 --> 01:24:48.591
<i>People don't understand...</i>

01:24:48.801 --> 01:24:51.588
...what's involved.
This is an art form.

01:24:51.846 --> 01:24:54.301
I think most people just think...

01:24:54.557 --> 01:24:57.723
...that I hold a camera
and point it at stuff.

01:24:57.977 --> 01:25:00.266
There's a lot more to it than that.

01:25:02.315 --> 01:25:05.814
Would you be interested in seeing
the inside of a van?

01:25:06.027 --> 01:25:09.312
You know, I really have to
get back to the party.

01:25:09.572 --> 01:25:11.280
Great idea.
I'll go with you.

01:25:11.532 --> 01:25:13.774
Let me just drop a tip here.

01:25:19.832 --> 01:25:21.326
Hi! How are you?

01:25:21.584 --> 01:25:23.375
Rita, this is Nancy.

01:25:24.503 --> 01:25:26.745
We were going to the party.
You going?

01:25:26.964 --> 01:25:29.585
Sounds like fun.
Maybe we should call Phil.

01:25:30.676 --> 01:25:32.752
I think he's already in there.

01:27:29.461 --> 01:27:30.707
Isn't he good?

01:27:30.963 --> 01:27:32.078
He's great!

01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:33.964
He's my student.

01:27:36.594 --> 01:27:38.468
I'm so proud.

01:27:39.639 --> 01:27:40.836
Thank you.

01:27:42.016 --> 01:27:44.055
Hello, welcome to our party.

01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:46.552
I didn't know you could
play like that.

01:27:46.812 --> 01:27:48.520
I'm versatile.

01:27:55.905 --> 01:27:58.941
It's that nice young man
from the motor club.

01:27:59.158 --> 01:28:00.652
Thank you again.

01:28:00.910 --> 01:28:02.320
It's nothing, ladies.

01:28:02.578 --> 01:28:05.829
He's the fastest jack
in Jefferson County.

01:28:08.292 --> 01:28:09.917
What was that all about?

01:28:10.169 --> 01:28:13.253
Don't know. They've been
hitting on me all night.

01:28:14.131 --> 01:28:15.507
There you are!

01:28:17.468 --> 01:28:20.671
I never thanked you properly
for what you did.

01:28:20.930 --> 01:28:22.970
He would've choked for sure.

01:28:23.224 --> 01:28:26.924
He may have. He was trying
to swallow a whole cow.

01:28:27.186 --> 01:28:28.384
I owe you one, buddy.

01:28:28.646 --> 01:28:31.766
Hang on to him, dear.
He's a real find.

01:28:34.193 --> 01:28:35.901
What did you do today?

01:28:36.154 --> 01:28:37.731
Same old, same old.

01:28:43.494 --> 01:28:45.036
Excuse me, Mr. Connors.

01:28:45.246 --> 01:28:46.824
Fred, how was the wedding?

01:28:47.081 --> 01:28:50.082
Thank you for making
Debbie go through with it.

01:28:50.334 --> 01:28:53.371
All I did was fan her flame
of passion for you.

01:28:53.629 --> 01:28:54.827
You are the best.

01:28:55.089 --> 01:28:56.121
No, you are.

01:28:56.382 --> 01:28:59.548
Rita, this is
Debbie and Fred Kleiser.

01:28:59.802 --> 01:29:03.634
- Here you go, kids. Congratulations.
- What is this?

01:29:04.098 --> 01:29:05.925
No way!

01:29:06.184 --> 01:29:09.303
Wrestle Mania!
No way!

01:29:10.271 --> 01:29:13.225
How'd you know?
We'll be in Pittsburgh anyway!

01:29:13.482 --> 01:29:15.309
Thank you. You're a real pal.

01:29:15.568 --> 01:29:17.441
Oh, this is the best.

01:29:22.241 --> 01:29:23.652
I don't understand.

01:29:23.910 --> 01:29:25.618
I guess not.

01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:28.872
How does everyone know you?
You come once a year.

01:29:29.123 --> 01:29:30.950
You're the most popular
person in town.

01:29:31.208 --> 01:29:33.415
Excuse me, Dr. Connors?

01:29:33.627 --> 01:29:36.545
I want to thank you
for fixing Felix's back.

01:29:36.755 --> 01:29:38.832
He can help around the house again.

01:29:39.050 --> 01:29:41.541
Well, I'm sorry
to hear that, Felix.

01:29:43.930 --> 01:29:45.554
Dr. Connors?

01:29:45.932 --> 01:29:48.257
It's kind of an honorary title.

01:29:48.518 --> 01:29:50.095
What is going on?

01:29:50.311 --> 01:29:51.342
I really don't know.

01:29:51.604 --> 01:29:54.060
There is something
going on with you.

01:29:54.648 --> 01:29:56.605
You want the long or short version?

01:29:56.859 --> 01:29:59.694
Let's start with the short
and go from there.

01:30:05.493 --> 01:30:07.485
Okay, folks, attention.

01:30:08.287 --> 01:30:11.407
Time for the bachelor auction.
You know the rules.

01:30:11.666 --> 01:30:14.121
All the eligible bachelors
come in front.

01:30:14.418 --> 01:30:15.877
And you ladies...

01:30:16.128 --> 01:30:17.457
...you bid on them!

01:30:17.713 --> 01:30:19.753
Do whatever you want with them...

01:30:20.007 --> 01:30:21.585
...no questions asked!

01:30:21.842 --> 01:30:24.927
I don't want to know about it,
as long as it's legal.

01:30:25.137 --> 01:30:29.515
Get out your pocketbooks,
and remember it's all for charity.

01:30:31.686 --> 01:30:33.263
What are you doing down here?

01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:35.015
Go on, get up there.

01:30:35.231 --> 01:30:38.315
I got 10 bucks
that says you're mine.

01:30:38.734 --> 01:30:40.644
Buster, I got your first victim.

01:30:40.861 --> 01:30:43.531
Phil Connors, come on up here!

01:30:48.578 --> 01:30:51.911
All right! Now, what am I bid
for this fine specimen?

01:30:52.207 --> 01:30:53.617
Five dollars!

01:30:53.833 --> 01:30:55.790
The bidding has begun
at five dollars.

01:30:56.085 --> 01:30:57.330
Ten dollars!

01:30:57.544 --> 01:30:58.743
Fifteen!

01:30:58.963 --> 01:31:00.955
- Twenty!
- Twenty-five!

01:31:01.173 --> 01:31:02.122
Thirty!

01:31:02.341 --> 01:31:04.133
- Thirty-five!
- Forty!

01:31:04.343 --> 01:31:05.339
Forty-five!

01:31:06.012 --> 01:31:07.043
Fifty!

01:31:07.305 --> 01:31:08.253
Fifty-five!

01:31:08.472 --> 01:31:09.468
Sixty!

01:31:09.682 --> 01:31:11.342
I'm bid $60.
Do I hear more?

01:31:15.146 --> 01:31:18.312
$339.88.

01:31:22.236 --> 01:31:26.068
We won't accept any more bids.
I think that's sold...

01:31:26.323 --> 01:31:29.989
...to the little lady for $339.88!

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:32.495
Congratulations!

01:31:40.588 --> 01:31:42.497
Okay, bachelors, who's next?

01:31:52.934 --> 01:31:56.219
All right! Now, what am I
bid for this guy?

01:31:56.437 --> 01:31:58.264
Do I hear a buck and a half?

01:31:58.564 --> 01:31:59.809
Anybody?

01:32:00.691 --> 01:32:01.723
75 cents?

01:32:01.942 --> 01:32:03.734
I bid a two pence!

01:32:04.361 --> 01:32:06.733
Sold to the lady for 25 cents.

01:32:06.947 --> 01:32:08.490
I got him!

01:32:16.749 --> 01:32:19.454
Phil Connors,
I thought that was you.

01:32:19.710 --> 01:32:22.166
This is Ned Ryerson,
my new insurance agent.

01:32:22.421 --> 01:32:23.666
I'll say.

01:32:24.882 --> 01:32:26.839
I haven't seen him for 20 years.

01:32:27.093 --> 01:32:32.134
He comes up and buys whole life,
term, fire, auto, dental, health...

01:32:32.348 --> 01:32:35.266
...with the optional death
and dismemberment plan.

01:32:35.518 --> 01:32:37.676
This is the best day of my life.

01:32:37.937 --> 01:32:40.060
- Mine too.
- Mine too.

01:32:40.272 --> 01:32:41.518
Where are we going?

01:32:41.774 --> 01:32:43.482
Let's not spoil it.

01:32:45.027 --> 01:32:47.649
Let's not...
I got that.

01:32:50.575 --> 01:32:51.985
Why can't I look?

01:32:52.451 --> 01:32:54.278
Because you bother me a lot.

01:32:54.579 --> 01:32:55.954
I'm getting cold.

01:32:56.164 --> 01:32:57.788
How long do I have to sit here?

01:32:58.416 --> 01:33:01.535
I'm giving you your money's worth.
You paid top dollar for me.

01:33:02.127 --> 01:33:04.453
Well, I think you were a bargain.

01:33:05.297 --> 01:33:07.420
Sweet of you to say.
You're right.

01:33:10.177 --> 01:33:11.588
Is it finished yet?

01:33:12.472 --> 01:33:15.342
I still have to put
cherry syrup on the top...

01:33:15.558 --> 01:33:16.589
...then we can eat it.

01:33:16.851 --> 01:33:19.520
Come on, Phil.
I'm freezing!

01:33:19.729 --> 01:33:21.389
One second, one second.

01:33:21.647 --> 01:33:23.438
Let me turn it in the light.

01:33:28.946 --> 01:33:30.440
It's amazing.

01:33:31.199 --> 01:33:32.443
It's beautiful.

01:33:36.746 --> 01:33:38.121
How did you do that?

01:33:38.957 --> 01:33:42.740
I know your face so well,
I could've done it with my eyes closed.

01:33:47.298 --> 01:33:48.709
It's lovely.

01:33:49.467 --> 01:33:51.293
I don't know what to say.

01:33:52.512 --> 01:33:53.709
I do.

01:33:55.806 --> 01:33:58.095
No matter what happens tomorrow...

01:33:58.351 --> 01:34:00.225
...or for the rest of my life...

01:34:00.436 --> 01:34:02.144
...I'm happy now...

01:34:03.355 --> 01:34:04.934
...because I love you.

01:34:05.858 --> 01:34:07.650
I think I'm happy too.

01:35:06.335 --> 01:35:07.498
<i>Please. Not again.</i>

01:35:07.711 --> 01:35:09.585
- <i>That's a great song.</i>
- <i>It's not.</i>

01:35:09.838 --> 01:35:11.878
<i>Don't listen to this man...</i>

01:35:12.466 --> 01:35:14.874
It's too early.

01:35:25.604 --> 01:35:27.396
Something is different.

01:35:28.024 --> 01:35:29.269
Good or bad?

01:35:29.650 --> 01:35:31.939
Anything different is good.

01:35:34.405 --> 01:35:36.694
But this could be real good.

01:35:41.579 --> 01:35:42.989
Why are you here?

01:35:43.456 --> 01:35:45.531
I bought you.
I own you.

01:35:48.043 --> 01:35:49.622
But why are you still here?

01:35:49.879 --> 01:35:52.963
You said, "Stay,"
so I stayed.

01:35:55.635 --> 01:35:57.674
I said, "Stay,"
so you stayed.

01:35:57.928 --> 01:36:00.466
I can't even make a collie stay.

01:36:02.642 --> 01:36:04.634
I got to check something.

01:36:05.436 --> 01:36:06.812
Stay.

01:36:07.229 --> 01:36:08.344
Stay.

01:36:13.986 --> 01:36:15.267
They're gone!

01:36:16.197 --> 01:36:17.774
They're all gone.

01:36:19.867 --> 01:36:22.572
- Do you know what today is?
- No, what?

01:36:23.913 --> 01:36:25.905
Today is tomorrow.

01:36:26.499 --> 01:36:27.827
It happened.

01:36:30.085 --> 01:36:32.328
- You're here.
- I'm here.

01:36:36.509 --> 01:36:41.135
Why weren't you like this last night?
You just fell asleep.

01:36:42.974 --> 01:36:45.761
It was the end of a very long day.

01:36:48.854 --> 01:36:52.639
Is there anything I can do
for you today?

01:36:53.526 --> 01:36:56.147
I'm sure I can think of something.

01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:31.263
It's so beautiful!

01:37:41.908 --> 01:37:43.532
