‐ [cameraman] Yeah.
‐ Yeah, but she was shot!

29:28.225 --> 29:29.017
The streetlights were out
'cause the city didn't care.

29:29.101 --> 29:31.144
You could be the first
to report on it.

29:33.397 --> 29:35.440
I'm at Soldier Field,
where vegetarians

29:35.524 --> 29:37.275
from across the city
are cheering.

29:37.359 --> 29:39.820
Is it for Dickie Burke's
end zone dance?

29:39.903 --> 29:42.572
Nope, it's the Bears'
meatless burger.

29:42.656 --> 29:45.283
[male reporter]
Meatless burger.

29:45.367 --> 29:46.284
That's right, you heard it.

29:46.368 --> 29:47.828
Everyone's excited about it.

29:47.911 --> 29:49.830
This is gonna be something
that people

29:49.913 --> 29:50.831
are gonna talk about
for a long time.

29:50.914 --> 29:54.501
The meatless burger
is in the stadium, folks.

29:54.584 --> 29:56.211
You gotta get down here
soon as you can...

29:56.294 --> 29:57.170
‐ [laughs]
‐ Stop it.

29:57.254 --> 29:58.338
I'm serious.

29:58.422 --> 30:01.174
It was November before I knew
I was in the wrong class.

30:01.258 --> 30:02.801
How did that even happen?

30:02.884 --> 30:05.429
I was a dumb college freshman,

30:05.512 --> 30:06.221
thought I was taking

30:06.304 --> 30:08.390
Better Orgasms:
A Woman's Study.

30:08.473 --> 30:09.182
I'd signed up for

30:09.266 --> 30:11.643
Better Organisms:
A Whale's Study.

30:11.727 --> 30:13.895
Oh, my.
That is rich.

30:13.979 --> 30:15.272
[both laughing]

30:15.355 --> 30:17.858
What could that woman
possibly see in Frank?

30:17.941 --> 30:18.525
[Veronica] Maybe she's blind.

30:18.608 --> 30:21.194
And has no sense
of smell.

30:21.278 --> 30:22.988
Kev, I've been looking,

30:23.071 --> 30:25.907
and Billy was one
of our best customers.

30:25.991 --> 30:27.701
God rest his soul.

30:27.784 --> 30:30.871
No, I mean he was, like,
28 percent of our business.

30:30.954 --> 30:32.873
Well, he used to always
buy everyone rounds.

30:32.956 --> 30:34.958
God rest his soul.

30:35.042 --> 30:36.626
We have a major
supply‐and‐demand problem

30:36.710 --> 30:38.128
on our hands.

30:38.211 --> 30:39.963
‐ Supply and demand?
‐ We have a lot of supply,

30:40.047 --> 30:41.673
and Billy was much
of our demand.

30:42.841 --> 30:43.467
We need more customers.

30:43.550 --> 30:45.469
Well, what's wrong with us?

30:45.552 --> 30:47.012
You drink like pussies.

30:47.095 --> 30:48.972
We need to find
hard‐core boozers.

30:49.056 --> 30:50.557
Come on.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.100
What if we just turned
this place into a juice bar?

30:52.184 --> 30:53.977
‐ Kev!
‐ I'm coming.

30:54.061 --> 30:55.854

Frank Gallagher,

30:56.396 --> 30:58.565

30:58.648 --> 30:59.858
I've been doing
all the talking.

30:59.941 --> 31:00.400
I don't know anything
about you.

31:00.484 --> 31:02.569
Where are you from?

31:02.652 --> 31:05.447
How did you end up
in this neck of the woods?

31:05.530 --> 31:08.408
City put a boot on my car.

31:08.492 --> 31:11.244

Quite a few parking tickets.

31:11.328 --> 31:12.871
[scoffs]

31:12.954 --> 31:15.916
Why didn't you say something
before?

31:17.751 --> 31:19.377
I will have that off

31:19.461 --> 31:20.962
in no time.

31:22.047 --> 31:25.926
Do you have an in with
the transportation department?

31:26.009 --> 31:29.179
No, I have an in

31:29.262 --> 31:31.098

31:31.181 --> 31:33.475
Oh.

31:35.352 --> 31:38.271
Mm.
So what are we gonna do now?

31:38.355 --> 31:38.814
Have sex.

31:38.897 --> 31:41.608
No, I mean, yes, yes,

31:41.691 --> 31:44.611
but what are we gonna do
when we have to go poop again?

31:44.694 --> 31:46.113
Is this your idea of foreplay?

31:46.196 --> 31:47.948
I'm trying to think ahead.

31:48.031 --> 31:51.576
Uh, we can dump it out.
It's that simple.

31:51.660 --> 31:52.619
You wanna be on top,
or should I?

31:52.702 --> 31:54.246
‐ Uh, no, you can.
‐ Okay.

31:54.329 --> 31:57.499
So haul buckets of crap
to a porta‐potty?

31:57.582 --> 31:58.792
Oh, yeah.
We use toilets in the house.

31:58.875 --> 31:59.918
‐ All right?
‐ Yeah.

32:00.001 --> 32:01.711
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ But walk over there

32:01.795 --> 32:03.588
in the middle of the night
in the winter?

32:03.672 --> 32:05.090
Hey, is there any chance
we can talk about this

32:05.173 --> 32:07.134
after the sex?

32:07.217 --> 32:07.968
‐ Yes.
‐ Yeah.

32:08.051 --> 32:09.970
‐ I'm sorry.
‐ Okay, that's okay.

32:10.053 --> 32:11.138
‐ Let's do this.
‐ Yep.

32:11.221 --> 32:12.722
[Tami] Yeah.

32:12.806 --> 32:13.765
You have a condom, right?

32:13.849 --> 32:14.975
No.

32:15.058 --> 32:16.518
We need one.

32:16.601 --> 32:18.019
You just had a baby.

32:18.103 --> 32:19.855
Yeah, and I can have
another one.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.106
Not while you're breastfeeding.

32:21.189 --> 32:23.150
That's an old wives' tale.

32:23.233 --> 32:24.734
‐ Are you sure?
‐ [laughs]

32:24.818 --> 32:26.945
I am the ripest
I've ever been right now.

32:27.028 --> 32:30.448
All right, well,
we can Google it,

32:30.532 --> 32:32.033
and then if I'm right,

32:32.117 --> 32:35.537
then, uh, I don't have
to go get a condom.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.122
‐ Go ahead.
‐ Right.

32:37.205 --> 32:41.042

is getting cold.

Hey, you wanna know
what I bought from Costco?

32:55.307 --> 32:55.849
I don't know.
Soap, hopefully.

32:55.932 --> 32:57.809
Nothing.
You know why?

32:57.893 --> 32:59.477
Why?
Eat your Szechuan beans.

Paula took
my fucking paycheck.

33:01.521 --> 33:02.689
What?

33:02.772 --> 33:05.692
Something about me owing her
for kickbacks or some bullshit.

33:05.775 --> 33:06.610
That's what POs are like, man.

33:06.693 --> 33:08.737
Sooner you accept it,

33:08.820 --> 33:09.863
the sooner
shit won't bother you.

33:09.946 --> 33:11.323
Okay, okay.
Easy for you to say.

33:11.406 --> 33:12.699
You have do‐gooder Larry.

33:12.782 --> 33:14.117
Look, look,
Paula's whole job

33:14.201 --> 33:15.493
is to make your life
miserable.

33:15.577 --> 33:18.580
Your job is to not
let it bother you.

33:18.663 --> 33:20.207
Or I could kill her.

33:20.290 --> 33:20.999
Yeah, great plan.
End up back in the joint.

33:21.082 --> 33:23.043
No, I think
it might be worth it.

33:23.126 --> 33:24.044
I don't know if I can handle
two more years

33:24.127 --> 33:25.545

about something else.

Hey!
How's it going?

33:34.179 --> 33:35.555
Is that Sbarro?

33:35.639 --> 33:36.890

You stalking me now?

33:39.976 --> 33:42.062
No, not here for you.
Uh‐uh.

33:42.145 --> 33:45.815
So that leaves just
one other person at this table.

33:45.899 --> 33:46.816
That's too fucking bad.

33:46.900 --> 33:48.276
You ain't my PO,
Lollipop Guild.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.236
Let's get out of here,

33:49.319 --> 33:50.487

33:50.570 --> 33:52.239
That's the rub.

33:52.322 --> 33:55.617
I made a little arrangement
with Larry, so sit.

33:55.700 --> 33:56.826
You're mine now.

33:58.662 --> 33:59.913

34:02.165 --> 34:03.917
It's never good
in a relationship

34:04.000 --> 34:06.127
when one partner
has a soft PO.

34:06.211 --> 34:07.754
This took a lot of effort
on my part

34:07.837 --> 34:09.130
to make this happen.

34:09.214 --> 34:10.507
Had to have dinner
with Larry and his wife

34:10.590 --> 34:11.967
at the Olive Garden.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.593
Ugh, those kids.

34:14.594 --> 34:16.554
Kept making the breadsticks
disappear.

34:16.638 --> 34:17.430
I wanted to tell him,
"That's not a trick.

34:17.514 --> 34:19.766
You're just a fat fuck,"
but whatever.

34:19.849 --> 34:23.270
Anyway, Larry switched with me,
so...you're welcome.

34:23.353 --> 34:24.104
Why would you do that?

34:24.187 --> 34:26.898
I never had
a Milkovich before.

34:26.982 --> 34:28.441
Always wanted one.

34:28.525 --> 34:30.110
So I seized the opportunity.

All right, I got
a two‐person job for you guys,

34:33.113 --> 34:35.198

with this lunch,

34:35.282 --> 34:38.076

on out of here, okay?
