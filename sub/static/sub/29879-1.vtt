WEBVTT

00:44.261 --> 00:46.698
Morning, Al.

00:46.742 --> 00:48.222
Hey!

00:48.265 --> 00:50.006
Looks like someone'’s
in the Christmas spirit.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.573
'’Tis the season.

00:51.616 --> 00:53.705
Hey, how about I come down
to the restaurant

00:53.749 --> 00:55.881
and get one of those special
Christmas hot cocoas you make?

00:55.925 --> 00:58.841
You can be one of the first to
try out my new holiday cookies.

00:58.884 --> 01:01.931
Ooh! How can I refuse
one of those special cookies?

01:01.974 --> 01:04.629
Yeah, everyone else
seems to find a way.

01:04.673 --> 01:06.457
Business still slow?

01:06.501 --> 01:07.980
People are just too busy
this time of year

01:08.024 --> 01:10.374
to give a hoot
about my little restaurant.

01:10.418 --> 01:12.289
It'’s not grand enough,
I guess.

01:12.333 --> 01:15.423
Don'’t you worry.
People will find you soon.

01:15.466 --> 01:17.251
You just need to find a way
to get noticed.

01:17.294 --> 01:19.601
Well, if you come up with
an idea, let me know.

01:19.644 --> 01:21.472
See ya.

01:21.516 --> 01:23.083
I will.

01:34.181 --> 01:35.617
GIDEON: Well?

01:38.185 --> 01:41.144
Well, I think
we can do better.

01:41.188 --> 01:43.668
- What?
- Yeah. Mr. Oliver,

01:43.712 --> 01:46.410
the Christmas Eve Banquet
is the most important event

01:46.454 --> 01:48.195
for the kingdom of Edgemont.

01:48.238 --> 01:49.718
Your Highness, I'’m well aware
of what'’s important

01:49.761 --> 01:51.285
to your kingdom.

01:51.328 --> 01:53.591
Your guests deserve the
very best cuisine in the city.

01:53.635 --> 01:57.421
True, but, uh, this...

01:57.465 --> 01:59.119
What is this again?

01:59.162 --> 02:01.512
This is my famous
deconstructed caprese.

02:01.556 --> 02:04.646
Deconstructed caprese. Hmm.

02:04.689 --> 02:06.735
Wonderful name, mediocre taste.

02:06.778 --> 02:10.434
Perhaps my guests would prefer
something a bit more...

02:10.478 --> 02:11.522
constructed.

03:18.937 --> 03:20.939
[door chimes ring]

03:20.983 --> 03:22.550
JESSICA: Morning, Hailee.

03:22.593 --> 03:24.378
It'’s beginning to look
a lot like Christmas.

03:24.421 --> 03:26.858
It'’s not too much, is it?

03:26.902 --> 03:28.730
When it comes
to Christmas decorations,

03:28.773 --> 03:30.253
there'’s no such thing
as too much.

03:30.297 --> 03:31.689
Morning, ladies.

03:31.733 --> 03:33.430
Morning, Ernie.
What do you think?

03:33.474 --> 03:35.867
Are the decorations too much?

03:35.911 --> 03:38.435
No, not at all.

03:38.479 --> 03:42.570
Unless it'’s not about
the decorations at all.

03:42.613 --> 03:46.008
It'’s just I thought
it would be different by now.

03:46.051 --> 03:48.924
Do you know how hard it is
to get noticed these days?

03:48.967 --> 03:50.491
Do you know there'’s
a food truck on Seventh,

03:50.534 --> 03:53.145
specializing in
50 different types of bacon?

03:53.189 --> 03:54.669
I rest my case.

03:54.712 --> 03:57.280
Jess, it'’s been six months.

03:57.324 --> 03:59.064
You got to give it a chance.

03:59.108 --> 04:01.284
Miracles don'’t happen overnight.

04:01.328 --> 04:03.155
Tell that to Mr. Elliott.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.680
Tell him yourself.

04:05.723 --> 04:06.768
[door chimes ring]

04:08.813 --> 04:11.294
Mr. Elliott! Cup of coffee?

04:11.338 --> 04:12.861
No, thanks.
I can'’t stay long.

04:12.904 --> 04:15.646
- Hey, Mr. Elliott. I'’m--
- Jessica, listen.

04:15.690 --> 04:18.257
I really appreciate
what you'’re doing here,

04:18.301 --> 04:20.041
trying to keep the place
going and all.

04:20.084 --> 04:23.088
There'’s just so much competition
in this neighborhood now.

04:23.132 --> 04:25.308
Did you know there'’s a new
food truck over on Seventh?

04:25.352 --> 04:27.441
Yes, with 50 types of bacon.
I know.

04:27.484 --> 04:28.746
Yeah, it'’s amazing, right?

04:28.790 --> 04:31.183
Look, I can give you
another month,

04:31.227 --> 04:34.448
but after that, I'’m going to
have to look for another tenant.

04:34.491 --> 04:35.971
We'’ll figure it out.

04:36.014 --> 04:37.451
MR. ELLIOTT:
Sincerely hope so.

04:37.494 --> 04:40.280
I would hate to see this place
close down.

04:45.807 --> 04:47.591
A month?

04:47.635 --> 04:50.246
How are you supposed to turn
this place around in a month?

04:50.290 --> 04:53.118
I don'’t know.
Christmas miracle?

05:05.392 --> 05:07.655
Yeah, I think you'’re missing
the target here, Mr. Oliver.

05:07.698 --> 05:09.091
You'’ll have to do
better than this

05:09.134 --> 05:10.527
if you want to cater
my event this year.

05:10.571 --> 05:12.703
I'’ll have to do better?

05:12.747 --> 05:15.097
Prince John, I'’m already
the best there is.

05:15.140 --> 05:16.794
You can'’t do any better than me.

05:16.838 --> 05:18.883
Sadly, I beg to differ.

05:18.927 --> 05:21.016
Now go back
to the drawing board

05:21.059 --> 05:24.280
and come up with something
a bit more appealing.

05:24.324 --> 05:29.024
Something that says Christmas
more than deconstructed caprese.

05:29.067 --> 05:33.071
Prince, this appetizer has been
awarded five stars three times.

05:33.115 --> 05:34.508
We can do better.

05:34.551 --> 05:36.640
It'’d be ill-advised
to serve this.

05:36.684 --> 05:39.077
Now if you'’ll excuse me,
I must be heading back now.

05:39.121 --> 05:40.470
I can'’t believe this.

05:40.514 --> 05:42.254
My menu is perfect.

05:42.298 --> 05:43.865
You'’re making a huge mistake.

05:43.908 --> 05:46.389
Perhaps,
but it'’s my mistake to make.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.173
Now, if you come up
with anything else,

05:48.217 --> 05:49.523
please let me know.

05:49.566 --> 05:52.352
But the queen
specifically requested me.

05:52.395 --> 05:54.441
You can'’t just leave me
hanging like this.

05:54.484 --> 05:56.486
Good day, Mr. Oliver.

06:01.665 --> 06:04.407
RUPERT: Bobby Flay
not available.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.409
Wolfgang Puck not available.

06:06.453 --> 06:10.108
Thomas Keller...
not available.

06:10.152 --> 06:13.329
What about that fellow
from the television show?

06:13.373 --> 06:15.070
The one about the diners
and the driving.

06:15.113 --> 06:16.941
Also not available.

06:16.985 --> 06:20.684
Sir, perhaps if we work
a little closer with Mr. Oliver,

06:20.728 --> 06:22.773
we'’ll achieve
the desired result.

06:22.817 --> 06:24.732
That egotistical
loudmouth braggart?

06:24.775 --> 06:26.647
No, Rupert, absolutely not.

06:26.690 --> 06:30.302
You know, I'’ve had it up to here
with his elitist culinary fare.

06:30.346 --> 06:32.392
We need something new.

06:32.435 --> 06:35.612
Prince John, the banquet
is Christmas Eve.

06:35.656 --> 06:38.702
Today is the 14th.
That gives you...

06:38.746 --> 06:39.703
Ten days.

06:39.747 --> 06:42.314
To secure a celebrity chef

06:42.358 --> 06:44.926
and plan a menu for one of
the biggest events of the year.

06:44.969 --> 06:46.406
Plenty of time.

06:46.449 --> 06:48.059
Perhaps it'’s not too late
to cancel.

06:48.103 --> 06:50.758
Rupert, did anyone ever tell you
that you worry too much?

06:50.801 --> 06:52.760
Yes. In fact, your mother.

06:52.803 --> 06:56.241
Which is precisely the reason
I was hired to this position

06:56.285 --> 06:58.548
in the first place.

06:58.592 --> 07:00.768
Besides, I couldn'’t exactly
say no.

07:00.811 --> 07:04.467
"No, Your Royal Majesticness,
I shan'’t work for the boy."

07:04.511 --> 07:06.643
No one ever says no to her.

07:06.687 --> 07:07.862
Maybe they should though.

07:07.905 --> 07:09.690
Hey, can you pull over here?

07:09.733 --> 07:11.169
I want to pick myself up
a newspaper.

07:21.528 --> 07:22.790
Keep the motor running.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.356
I'’m gonna grab a quick bite
as well.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.794
No, no, sir, I can have
something prepared for us

07:26.837 --> 07:28.709
at the hotel, Your Highness.

07:28.752 --> 07:31.668
I think I prefer
something more native.

07:31.712 --> 07:33.801
[sniffs]

07:33.844 --> 07:36.325
Do you smell that?

07:36.368 --> 07:37.718
Smells like
it'’s coming from there.

07:37.761 --> 07:40.372
RUPERT: You can'’t
be serious, sir.

07:40.416 --> 07:42.113
I'’ll give you a call
if I need you.

07:42.157 --> 07:43.941
Now, if you'’ll excuse me.

07:43.985 --> 07:46.291
No, no, I must protest.

your, um, loaf of meat.

- All right, one meatloaf?
- Correct.

Anything to drink?

09:13.204 --> 09:16.512
Uh, coffee would be great.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.732
Cinnamon, nutmeg,
or peppermint?

09:18.775 --> 09:19.689
Cinnamon.

09:22.692 --> 09:23.954
Have a cookie.

Here you go, Ernie.

09:34.356 --> 09:36.619

09:36.663 --> 09:38.186
Don'’t you know who that is?

09:38.229 --> 09:39.491
Told you she wouldn'’t know
who he is.

09:39.535 --> 09:41.232
Know what? Who is he?

09:41.276 --> 09:45.062
Prince John... of Edgemont.

09:45.106 --> 09:47.630
His picture'’s in all the papers.

09:47.674 --> 09:51.199
Seriously? You'’re telling me
thatguy is a prince?

09:51.242 --> 09:53.505
He'’s theprince.

09:53.549 --> 09:57.640
Well, apparently, theprince
wants some meatloaf.

09:57.684 --> 09:59.294
All right.

09:59.337 --> 10:01.818
Well, His Highness
can have meatloaf.

10:01.862 --> 10:03.777
Okay.

10:06.562 --> 10:08.346
How could she not know?

10:08.390 --> 10:11.219
Doesn'’t own a TV, I guess.

10:13.177 --> 10:14.918
Here you go.

10:16.311 --> 10:18.443
Ah! Just what I was hoping for.

10:28.410 --> 10:31.718
Do I taste... venison?

10:32.762 --> 10:34.546
Just a touch.

10:34.590 --> 10:37.767
I like to offer something
a little different,

10:37.811 --> 10:39.334
without straying too far away

10:39.377 --> 10:42.337
from the traditional foods
I grew up with.

10:42.380 --> 10:44.905
Well, it'’s absolutely
extraordinary.

10:44.948 --> 10:47.298
I'’d like to get another one
to go, if you don'’t mind.

10:47.342 --> 10:51.085
I have someone at the hotel,
who would really enjoy this.

10:52.564 --> 10:54.784
Oh?

10:54.828 --> 10:56.264
My traveling companion.

10:56.307 --> 11:00.485
He'’s kind of like
my social secretary.

11:00.529 --> 11:05.142
Hailee, would you get that to-go
order working, please?

11:05.186 --> 11:06.491
Sure thing.

11:09.756 --> 11:14.021
The trick is to use
chicken stock instead of milk.

11:14.064 --> 11:16.850
Fascinating.

11:16.893 --> 11:20.070
So what'’s your story, uh...

11:20.114 --> 11:21.550
Jessica.

11:21.593 --> 11:23.508
Jessica. What'’s your story?

11:23.552 --> 11:25.249
What do you mean?

11:25.293 --> 11:28.470
Well, you just seem so young to
be running your own restaurant.

11:28.513 --> 11:31.212
Oh, well, I always wanted
my own place.

11:31.255 --> 11:33.823
And then when I went to culinary
school up in New Rochelle--

11:33.867 --> 11:35.607
Culinary school!

11:35.651 --> 11:39.524
Well, that explains it.
You'’re classically trained.

11:39.568 --> 11:42.266
Sort of.
I figured I could bring

11:42.310 --> 11:44.834
everything I learned in school
back here

11:44.878 --> 11:47.794
and create a blend
of fine cuisine

11:47.837 --> 11:50.579
mixed with my favorite
childhood foods.

11:50.622 --> 11:53.364
And may I say you have
succeeded admirably.

11:53.408 --> 11:58.195
You know, I may be
in the market for a chef.

11:58.239 --> 12:01.242
As in private executive chef?

12:01.285 --> 12:02.765
Not quite.

12:02.809 --> 12:05.376
You know, my family hosts
a Christmas Eve banquet

12:05.420 --> 12:07.161
every year
at the midtown museum.

12:07.204 --> 12:12.166
It'’s a charitable event
and very well attended.

12:13.776 --> 12:15.647
How about it?

12:16.779 --> 12:18.085
How about what?

12:18.128 --> 12:20.827
Would you like to cater
the banquet?

12:22.959 --> 12:26.223
Wait. What?

12:26.267 --> 12:29.226
I love your enthusiasm,
and you'’re obviously talented.

12:29.270 --> 12:32.229
And I just need someone new.

12:32.273 --> 12:37.365
Something fresh that turns
the apple cart on its head.

12:37.408 --> 12:39.497
All you'’ve had is our meatloaf.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.761
Everything else
could be terrible.

12:41.804 --> 12:44.546
Wouldn'’t hurt to talk about it.

12:44.589 --> 12:50.291
Okay, um, I'’m very flattered,
but have you looked around?

12:50.334 --> 12:53.424
I mean, I don'’t have
the staff or the facilities

12:53.468 --> 12:55.470
to cater something that size.

12:55.513 --> 12:58.125
I think you'’re underestimating
yourself just a little bit.

12:58.168 --> 13:00.040
Don'’t get me wrong,
Your Highness.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.563
Oh, please, my name'’s Jack.

13:01.606 --> 13:02.607
Excuse me?

13:02.651 --> 13:04.000
My name'’s actually John,

13:04.044 --> 13:06.394
but my friends call me Jack.

13:06.437 --> 13:08.352
I wasn'’t sure you knew
who I was.

13:14.358 --> 13:16.839
They told me.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.841
Look, um, your prince-ship,

13:18.885 --> 13:21.975
there is literally an entire
city out there

13:22.018 --> 13:25.674
full of chefs who would jump
at the opportunity to cater--

13:25.717 --> 13:28.895
Could you just excuse us
for one moment?

13:30.897 --> 13:32.202
Whoa! What'’s going on?

13:32.246 --> 13:34.857
Are you even hearing yourself
out there?

13:34.901 --> 13:38.513
This prince is the answer
to all of our problems.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.950
You need a Christmas miracle,
and there he is.

13:40.994 --> 13:43.039
- Hailee, please.
- No, she'’s right.

13:43.083 --> 13:44.736
This gig could
turn it all around.

13:44.780 --> 13:46.651
You gotta take it.

13:46.695 --> 13:50.264
And have you thought about just
how we'’re gonna pull this off?

13:50.307 --> 13:53.093
Where there'’s a will,
there'’s a way.

13:53.136 --> 13:55.008
You gotta do this.

14:04.321 --> 14:05.496
Thank you.

14:07.281 --> 14:09.544
Well?

14:09.587 --> 14:11.763
Okay, we can talk about it.

14:11.807 --> 14:13.548
Excellent. When?

14:13.591 --> 14:19.510
Tomorrow morning, but it has
to be a menu that works for me.

14:19.554 --> 14:21.382
Agreed.

14:21.425 --> 14:23.645
Until tomorrow.

14:28.432 --> 14:29.912
HAILEE: Wow.

14:29.956 --> 14:32.219
A prince walks into
our restaurant,

14:32.262 --> 14:34.221
tries the meatloaf,

14:34.264 --> 14:37.093
offers you a big contract,

14:37.137 --> 14:39.226
and then kisses your hand?

14:40.967 --> 14:43.230
What a way to start the day.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.429
Sweetheart, is that you?

15:08.472 --> 15:10.779
JESSICA: Hey, Ma, it'’s me.

15:10.822 --> 15:12.607
Brought you some leftovers.

15:18.134 --> 15:20.615
Mmm! It smells good in here.

15:20.658 --> 15:22.356
Just like Grandma'’s kitchen.

15:22.399 --> 15:24.575
Who do you think I got it from?

15:28.014 --> 15:29.450
I brought you some
stuffed Cornish hens

15:29.493 --> 15:30.930
with a brown butter sauce.

15:30.973 --> 15:32.844
You always bring
the most interesting things.

15:32.888 --> 15:34.063
How do you manage it all?

15:34.107 --> 15:36.457
Well, it was another slow day.

15:36.500 --> 15:39.808
They just didn'’t sell
very well.

15:39.851 --> 15:41.462
I'’m sorry to hear that,
sweetheart.

15:41.505 --> 15:42.985
People don'’t know
what they'’re missing.

15:43.029 --> 15:44.813
LINDA: But we'’re so glad
you'’re here.

15:44.856 --> 15:46.989
It'’s been a long time since you
came home for the holidays.

15:47.033 --> 15:49.426
I know. I just didn'’t feel like
spending another week alone

15:49.470 --> 15:51.080
in New Jersey.

15:51.124 --> 15:52.864
The commute alone is killing me.

15:52.908 --> 15:55.737
Well, you'’re always
welcome here, Jessie.

15:55.780 --> 15:57.869
Take a load off.
Tell us about your day.

15:57.913 --> 16:02.744
Well, for starters, the landlord
stopped in first thing.

16:02.787 --> 16:06.530
He'’s really nice, but he wants
his rent and his back rent.

16:06.574 --> 16:10.012
I'’m sorry, honey.
We know how hard you'’ve tried.

16:10.056 --> 16:12.362
And you know we'’d help you out
if we could.

16:12.406 --> 16:14.930
No. My problems
are not your problems.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.671
Or at least
they shouldn'’t be anyway.

16:18.412 --> 16:21.023
Oh, and we got our first
celebrity customer today,

16:21.067 --> 16:22.720
so that'’s something, right?

16:22.764 --> 16:24.984
GARY: Celebrities are
your mother'’s department.

16:25.027 --> 16:27.464
She'’s always watching that TMP.

16:27.508 --> 16:28.944
TMZ.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.076
Who was it?

16:30.119 --> 16:32.600
Uh, a real-life prince.

16:32.643 --> 16:34.471
Prince?

16:34.515 --> 16:36.734
Yeah, John or Jake...

16:36.778 --> 16:37.909
John?

16:37.953 --> 16:39.302
JESSICA: Yeah, that'’s the one.

16:39.346 --> 16:41.826
Prince John of Edgemont
was in your restaurant?

16:41.870 --> 16:43.524
And get this.

16:43.567 --> 16:47.354
He wants me to cater
some fancy event he'’s hosting.

16:47.397 --> 16:49.834
The annual
Edgemont Christmas Eve Banquet?

16:49.878 --> 16:52.402
Yeah. How does everyone know
about this except me?

16:52.446 --> 16:54.143
'’Cause you don't watch TMP.

16:54.187 --> 16:55.318
LINDA: TMZ!

16:55.362 --> 16:56.667
Oh, my goodness.

16:56.711 --> 16:58.669
How exciting!

16:58.713 --> 17:01.107
We'’re gonna have to get you
a new dress, something classy.

17:01.150 --> 17:03.065
Maybe you'’ll get
your picture on TV.

17:03.109 --> 17:04.935
Mom, relax.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.634
A real prince.

17:06.676 --> 17:07.983
And he'’s single.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.070
Mom!

17:09.115 --> 17:10.637
Was he wearing a ring?

17:10.681 --> 17:12.727
No ring.

17:12.770 --> 17:15.425
[laughing]

17:15.469 --> 17:16.818
Sorry, Pop.

17:26.262 --> 17:28.569
So without even consulting with
your mother,

17:28.612 --> 17:31.746
you asked this young lady
to cater the affair.

17:31.789 --> 17:34.140
Yeah, yeah, I did, Rupert.

17:34.183 --> 17:36.838
A bold move.

17:36.881 --> 17:39.188
And whom did you say
this woman was again?

17:39.232 --> 17:41.625
That'’s just it.
She'’s a culinary artist

17:41.669 --> 17:45.412
who owns her own little
restaurant in Brooklyn.

17:45.455 --> 17:46.891
At least I think she does.

17:46.935 --> 17:48.458
Brooklyn.

17:48.502 --> 17:50.982
I'’m so glad you researched
your decision carefully

17:51.026 --> 17:53.811
before making her an offer,

17:53.855 --> 17:57.554
although this really is
rather quite good.

17:57.598 --> 18:00.470
Yeah, it'’s a pity
she hasn'’t committed yet.

18:00.514 --> 18:03.256
Never fear, Your Highness.
As I'’ve told you,

18:03.299 --> 18:05.519
I'’ve been working on
a replacement.

18:05.562 --> 18:06.911
Yeah, I know.

18:06.955 --> 18:08.609
So then why her?

18:08.652 --> 18:10.611
She didn'’t even know who I was.

18:10.654 --> 18:13.788
Do you have any idea
how refreshing that is

18:13.831 --> 18:16.878
to meet someone that actually
says no once in a while?

18:16.921 --> 18:20.969
Well, it sounds like it may be
a moot point anyway,

18:21.012 --> 18:23.145
which is too bad because
this meatloaf really is

18:23.189 --> 18:25.321
rather quite indulging.

18:25.365 --> 18:27.889
She uses chicken stock
instead of milk.

18:27.932 --> 18:29.847
Fascinating.

18:35.766 --> 18:38.291
Don'’t worry, Jessie.

18:38.334 --> 18:41.120
I'’ll figure something out.

18:41.163 --> 18:42.947
Have to.

18:58.485 --> 19:00.182
PRINCE JACK:
Oh, my goodness.

19:00.226 --> 19:02.489
Isn'’t that the most adorable
thing you'’ve ever seen?

19:02.532 --> 19:04.273
LINDA: Oh, look at this one.

19:04.317 --> 19:06.362
GARY: I took that with the new
camera I got that Christmas.

19:06.406 --> 19:08.930
PRINCE JACK:
Did you? That'’s amazing.

19:08.973 --> 19:11.541
Quality'’s exceptional.

19:11.585 --> 19:14.414
There she is.
Takes after her mother.

19:16.285 --> 19:17.895
There'’s the sleepyhead.

19:23.074 --> 19:24.685
What are you doing here?

19:24.728 --> 19:27.905
Your mother was showing me
the most adorable photos.

19:27.949 --> 19:31.039
You were a snowman
in your school'’s Christmas play?

19:31.082 --> 19:34.303
Snow woman, thank you very much.

19:35.913 --> 19:38.612
What are you doing here?

19:38.655 --> 19:41.528
Oh, and look at this one.
She'’s a princess.

19:41.571 --> 19:43.443
I think she'’s been waiting
for a prince ever since.

19:43.486 --> 19:47.838
No, no, no, no,
she certainly has not.

19:50.232 --> 19:52.191
How did you even know
I was here?

19:52.234 --> 19:53.540
Well, I might be a prince,

19:53.583 --> 19:55.455
but it'’s not exactly
the Middle Ages.

19:55.498 --> 19:58.719
Edgemont has a top-notch
intelligence service.

19:58.762 --> 20:01.112
Actually, your online
business registration

20:01.156 --> 20:03.419
listed this
as your primary residence.

20:03.463 --> 20:06.901
But I don'’t even
live here anymore. I'’m--

20:06.944 --> 20:08.772
I'’m just visiting.

20:08.816 --> 20:10.339
Lucky me.

20:10.383 --> 20:12.907
Okay, that does not
give you the right

20:12.950 --> 20:16.084
to track me down,
prince or no prince.

20:16.127 --> 20:18.695
Are you bugging my phones too?

20:18.739 --> 20:21.045
Not yet. Should I?

20:21.089 --> 20:23.787
Look, I told you,
I don'’t take no for an answer.

20:23.831 --> 20:25.572
So are you ready
to talk about this?

20:25.615 --> 20:27.313
Did you track me down
so that we could talk

20:27.356 --> 20:29.228
about me catering your banquet?

20:31.317 --> 20:33.101
Unbelievable!

20:33.144 --> 20:34.798
You said you wanted
to talk in the morning,

20:34.842 --> 20:36.104
and time is of the essence.

20:36.147 --> 20:38.193
- She'’d love to.
- Mom!

20:38.237 --> 20:40.761
Can she bring a guest?
Is there a dress code?

20:40.804 --> 20:42.545
I mean, does everyone have
to wear a designer dress,

20:42.589 --> 20:44.286
or is that more of a suggestion?

20:44.330 --> 20:46.027
Can I have a word with you
in the kitchen, please?

20:46.070 --> 20:48.247
But George Clooney
will be there, right?

20:48.290 --> 20:50.423
Mommy, please?

20:50.466 --> 20:53.295
Excuse me, Your Honor.

20:53.339 --> 20:54.383
Your Highness.

20:54.427 --> 20:56.211
Please, my friends call me Jack.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.344
Mom! We'’re going.

20:58.387 --> 20:59.649
Oh...

21:04.219 --> 21:05.568
He'’s so handsome.

21:05.612 --> 21:07.570
I only told him
I would think about it.

21:07.614 --> 21:08.919
And he'’s single!

21:08.963 --> 21:11.095
Mom, how long were you guys

21:11.139 --> 21:13.620
talking about me
before I came downstairs?

21:13.663 --> 21:16.405
The point is, Jessie,

21:16.449 --> 21:18.407
maybe you have a chance
to become a princess.

21:18.451 --> 21:21.105
Wouldn'’t that be grand?
You could be the next Megan.

21:21.149 --> 21:23.412
Mom, he wants to hire me
as a caterer.

21:23.456 --> 21:25.284
That is not a marriage proposal.

21:25.327 --> 21:26.676
Not yet anyway.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.112
Mom, please!

21:28.156 --> 21:30.201
He showed up at our doorstep
at 6:30.

21:30.245 --> 21:32.769
Okay, well, he really likes
my meatloaf.

21:32.813 --> 21:34.728
And I love the bagels
down at Bourbon'’s,

21:34.771 --> 21:36.730
but I'’m not exactly
showing up at their house.

21:36.773 --> 21:39.428
I just don'’t think he can stand
not getting what he wants.

21:39.472 --> 21:41.865
No one ever says no to him.

21:41.909 --> 21:44.085
All I'’m asking is for you
to think about it

21:44.128 --> 21:46.653
and what it could mean for you
and the restaurant.

21:46.696 --> 21:49.786
The notoriety alone could
pump new life into the place.

21:49.830 --> 21:52.441
That'’s what everyone
keeps telling me.

21:54.051 --> 21:56.315
Goodness knows it needs it.

21:56.358 --> 21:57.446
Okay.

22:06.412 --> 22:08.283
I can see that I'’m imposing,

22:08.327 --> 22:10.503
and I realize I can be
a little pushy at times,

22:10.546 --> 22:14.376
so thank you for
the trip down Memory Lane.

22:14.420 --> 22:17.205
Your house is wonderful.

22:17.248 --> 22:19.512
Thank you for the coffee.

22:21.775 --> 22:23.080
Thank you.

22:25.909 --> 22:27.998
Wait.

22:28.042 --> 22:29.652
I'’m not sure how
I'’m gonna pull this off,

22:29.696 --> 22:33.656
but I do need the gig
to pay this week'’s payroll

22:33.700 --> 22:36.006
and next month'’s rent, so...

22:36.050 --> 22:37.356
So you'’ll do it?

22:38.661 --> 22:41.272
You might be sorry,
but yeah, okay.

22:41.316 --> 22:43.318
Splendid.
We have no time to waste.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.189
The banquet is
just around the corner,

22:45.233 --> 22:46.582
and we are starting
from scratch.

22:46.626 --> 22:48.410
Please, come to the Park Terrace
this afternoon,

22:48.454 --> 22:49.455
and we'’ll get started.

22:49.498 --> 22:51.674
Park Terrace. Got it.

22:51.718 --> 22:54.982
Here. Something
to get you started.

22:59.421 --> 23:00.988
This is a lot of money.

23:01.031 --> 23:02.598
It'’s okay. I trust you.

23:03.730 --> 23:04.687
Good day.

23:10.084 --> 23:12.391
But do I trust me?

23:23.358 --> 23:25.534
HAILEE: Jessica,
you missed the morning rush.

23:25.578 --> 23:27.754
Yeah, we had
three whole customers.

23:27.797 --> 23:30.321
I thought we were gonna have
to brew a second pot of coffee.

23:30.365 --> 23:32.411
Okay, guys, listen up.

23:32.454 --> 23:38.242
I just wanted to let you know
that I have decided.

23:38.286 --> 23:40.288
We are going to be catering

23:40.331 --> 23:42.856
the annual
Edgemont Christmas Eve Banquet.

23:42.899 --> 23:43.900
You said yes?

23:43.944 --> 23:46.294
And by cater, you mean...

23:46.337 --> 23:49.123
how many guests exactly?

23:49.166 --> 23:50.907
You know, more than a few.

23:50.951 --> 23:53.432
Looks like we might need that
second pot of coffee after all.

23:53.475 --> 23:55.521
Believe me, it'’ll work out.

23:55.564 --> 23:56.913
We'’ll make the best of it.

23:56.957 --> 23:58.480
I was skeptical at first.
Very skeptical.

23:58.524 --> 24:00.308
But then I started
thinking that--

24:00.351 --> 24:02.658
What will happen when word
gets out that we'’re catering

24:02.702 --> 24:04.834
theRoyal Christmas Banquet?

24:04.878 --> 24:08.359
Everyone will rush in to get a
taste of that royal experience.

24:08.403 --> 24:11.493
This could save
the restaurant, okay?

24:11.537 --> 24:13.495
We'’ll be good for
at least a little while.

24:13.539 --> 24:15.062
But we'’ll probably have
to close up shop for a bit

24:15.105 --> 24:16.585
to handle everything.

24:16.629 --> 24:19.762
Right, so, Ernie,
I need a list of equipment.

24:19.806 --> 24:22.330
Hailee, we'’re gonna need
more help in kitchen.

24:22.373 --> 24:23.853
Can you assemble a list?

24:23.897 --> 24:26.856
I will handle the waitstaff.

24:26.900 --> 24:28.510
We need to crush it.

24:28.554 --> 24:30.599
We'’ve got to crush it.

24:30.643 --> 24:32.383
Let'’s get to it.

24:44.744 --> 24:46.049
Miss Burns.

24:46.093 --> 24:47.790
Hi.

24:47.834 --> 24:51.054
I'’m Rupert, His Highness'
personal assistant.

24:51.098 --> 24:52.142
Nice to meet you.

24:52.186 --> 24:55.102
Uh, welcome. Please come.

25:02.936 --> 25:04.851
This way, ma'’am.

25:10.770 --> 25:13.033
Jessica.

25:13.076 --> 25:15.775
I'’m glad you could make it.

25:15.818 --> 25:18.342
What do you think?

25:18.386 --> 25:21.998
Um, nice digs.

25:22.042 --> 25:23.565
This is nice.

25:23.609 --> 25:24.653
It suffices.

25:27.264 --> 25:28.701
Your coat, ma'’am.

25:28.744 --> 25:29.919
Yeah.

25:32.052 --> 25:33.532
Um, guest list?

25:33.575 --> 25:36.404
Yes, yes.
It'’s a work in progress.

25:36.447 --> 25:39.102
Wow.

25:39.146 --> 25:41.714
I am curious
about one thing though.

25:41.757 --> 25:45.065
How did you guys get so far into
this without hiring a caterer?

25:45.108 --> 25:49.373
Let'’s just say your predecessor
and I had a disagreement.

25:52.899 --> 25:54.857
Must have been
some disagreement.

25:54.901 --> 25:57.425
Replace someone with
only one week left to go?

25:57.468 --> 25:59.949
Well, as your predecessor
might have said,

25:59.993 --> 26:02.952
he'’d made a proper dog's dinner
out of things.

26:02.996 --> 26:06.042
Wait, are you talking about
Gideon Oliver?

26:10.177 --> 26:12.919
You fired Gideon Oliver?

26:12.962 --> 26:14.268
Whatever you'’ve heard,

26:14.311 --> 26:18.141
he completely lives up to
his reputation.

26:18.185 --> 26:19.316
Please, come sit.

26:23.407 --> 26:25.671
RUPERT: I'’ll take care
of your coat, ma'’am.

26:25.714 --> 26:27.716
Tea, sir?

26:27.760 --> 26:29.196
Coffee, Rupert.

26:29.239 --> 26:30.719
Coffee.

26:34.897 --> 26:37.639
So these are
our previous menus.

26:37.683 --> 26:39.641
Let me know what you think.

26:39.685 --> 26:41.730
This is your fifth year, huh?

26:41.774 --> 26:45.299
As you see, there is a tradition
that will need to be upheld.

26:45.342 --> 26:46.909
Yes.

26:46.953 --> 26:48.737
I'’m sure a woman
of your talents

26:48.781 --> 26:51.958
would have no trouble capturing
the dishes on these menus.

26:52.001 --> 26:53.916
Assuming that'’s what we'd want.

26:53.960 --> 26:55.352
I beg your pardon?

26:55.396 --> 26:57.920
It'’s just all so pretentious.

26:57.964 --> 27:01.532
Remember, my menu, my way.

27:01.576 --> 27:05.580
Of course,
but this is a royal banquet.

27:05.624 --> 27:08.888
You know, pretentiousness
is built into the invitation.

27:08.931 --> 27:10.890
I'’m not saying
it can'’t be classy.

27:10.933 --> 27:16.722
I'’m just saying I'm not sure
if people would really enjoy...

27:16.765 --> 27:19.246
"Poached farm-raised halibut

27:19.289 --> 27:23.337
resting upon a dried aubergine
with torn mint crème fraîche."

27:23.380 --> 27:25.078
I see what you mean,

27:25.121 --> 27:28.603
but it is actually quite popular
with the Duke of Shrewsbury.

27:28.647 --> 27:32.476
Perhaps, but do you really think
the Duke of Shrewsbury

27:32.520 --> 27:34.609
is sitting in his limousine,

27:34.653 --> 27:36.306
slowly making his way
up Fifth Avenue

27:36.350 --> 27:38.004
and saying to his wife,

27:38.047 --> 27:41.616
"I do hope they'’re serving
torn mint tonight."

27:41.660 --> 27:43.139
Okay.

27:45.228 --> 27:46.708
What would you suggest?

27:46.752 --> 27:49.580
I don'’t know yet,
but we do need a menu.

27:49.624 --> 27:51.844
You know, something you can
walk around with,

27:51.887 --> 27:55.369
something that'’ll tie
this whole experience together.

27:55.412 --> 28:00.548
Okay, I was thinking of some
kind of greatest hits menu.

28:00.591 --> 28:04.857
Um, that'’s something you do
when you run out of fresh ideas.

28:04.900 --> 28:06.728
Are you sure you'’re not
overthinking this

28:06.772 --> 28:07.903
just a little bit?

28:07.947 --> 28:09.862
When you asked me to do this,

28:09.905 --> 28:13.604
it'’s because you wanted
something different, right?

28:13.648 --> 28:15.302
Yes, of course.

28:15.345 --> 28:17.434
Then that'’s what we're gonna do.

28:17.478 --> 28:19.088
Cooking for people
at Christmastime

28:19.132 --> 28:21.656
is the reason why I got into
this business.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.745
It'’s what I'm good at.
It'’s what I do.

28:23.789 --> 28:26.487
Trust me, and we are
gonna make this

28:26.530 --> 28:30.883
a Christmas dinner
that no one will ever forget.

28:30.926 --> 28:33.015
Not even the Duke of Shrewsbury.

28:43.504 --> 28:45.898
You'’re a fascinating woman,
Jessica Burns.

28:45.941 --> 28:47.247
I'’ve been called many things,

28:47.290 --> 28:49.510
but fascinating
isn'’t one of them.

28:49.553 --> 28:51.773
However, I do promise you
if you stick with me,

28:51.817 --> 28:53.470
we'’ll make this
an event to remember.

28:53.514 --> 28:55.429
Then stick with you I shall.

28:55.472 --> 28:57.648
- There he is. Go.
- I see him.

28:58.824 --> 29:00.042
That'’s my cue.

29:00.086 --> 29:01.391
I'’ll see you tomorrow.

29:01.435 --> 29:03.176
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

29:04.699 --> 29:06.788
I am pleased to announce
that we have hired

29:06.832 --> 29:08.529
a fantastic new caterer
for the event,

29:08.572 --> 29:10.487
and everything is
proceeding wonderfully.

29:10.531 --> 29:11.750
Thank you.

29:18.408 --> 29:21.324
This thing is $500.

29:21.368 --> 29:23.544
It'’s his money.

29:23.587 --> 29:24.806
So let me get this straight.

29:24.850 --> 29:27.374
He just gave you the cash?

29:27.417 --> 29:30.333
He said he didn'’t
want me to worry.

29:30.377 --> 29:33.467
Oh, he'’s got it bad for you.

29:35.164 --> 29:37.819
Shut up and get back to work.

29:47.133 --> 29:49.831
So the banquet
is nearly upon us.

29:49.875 --> 29:52.703
You don'’t think I have that
countdown seared into my brain?

29:52.747 --> 29:57.273
Are you sure it'’s wise to put
so much faith in this woman?

29:57.317 --> 30:01.016
This woman has a name.
It'’s Jessica.

30:01.060 --> 30:02.713
And is it
that much more riskier

30:02.757 --> 30:06.108
than trusting that snobby
egomaniac Gideon Oliver?

30:06.152 --> 30:07.675
That snobby egomaniac

30:07.718 --> 30:10.373
has a restaurant empire
known around the world.

30:10.417 --> 30:13.333
This woman--

30:13.376 --> 30:14.725
Jessica--

30:14.769 --> 30:18.294
owns a small, failing diner
in Brooklyn.

30:18.338 --> 30:20.209
As if any other diner
on the Upper West Side

30:20.253 --> 30:22.211
would be any different.

30:22.255 --> 30:25.301
Have you thought about what'’ll
happen if this doesn'’t work out?

30:25.345 --> 30:28.000
No, I have not.
What can go wrong?

30:28.043 --> 30:29.784
Everything.

30:29.828 --> 30:33.875
Wow. Thank you for
the vote of confidence, Hailee.

30:33.919 --> 30:37.139
I just have to think of a few
amazing ideas, that'’s all.

30:37.183 --> 30:40.490
All eyes are going to be
on this banquet.

30:40.534 --> 30:44.451
Rupert, banquet is just
a fancy word for dinner.

30:44.494 --> 30:46.888
And she is a chef.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.455
A great one.

30:48.498 --> 30:49.978
I hope.

30:50.022 --> 30:51.501
HAILEE: I don'’t get it.

30:51.545 --> 30:53.460
Two days ago,
you were dead set against it.

30:53.503 --> 30:55.157
And you were dead set for it.

30:55.201 --> 30:57.638
A girl can change her mind,
can'’t she?

30:57.681 --> 31:02.512
She might, if she had
the proper motivation.

31:02.556 --> 31:04.993
You like her.

31:05.037 --> 31:06.908
Why don'’t you just admit it?

31:06.952 --> 31:10.607
As it so happens,
I do find her very...

31:10.651 --> 31:12.087
talented, yes.

31:12.131 --> 31:14.176
And attractive.

31:14.220 --> 31:16.744
Yes, and attractive.

31:16.787 --> 31:19.703
Oh, come on, you can'’t tell me
you didn'’t happen to notice

31:19.747 --> 31:21.792
he'’s a devastatingly
handsome prince.

31:21.836 --> 31:24.752
He'’s... He's all right.

31:24.795 --> 31:27.711
And I'’m pretty sure he has
his fair share of girlfriends

31:27.755 --> 31:30.018
back home, too, so...

31:30.062 --> 31:33.282
Jessica is completely different
than any of the women back home.

31:33.326 --> 31:35.110
I get it, I get it.

31:35.154 --> 31:37.330
You'’re bored
of all the socialites,

31:37.373 --> 31:40.855
so you'’d gone and set
your sights on an American.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.553
An American?

31:43.597 --> 31:45.033
Now who'’s snobby?

31:45.077 --> 31:47.601
Listen, I worked my butt off,

31:47.644 --> 31:51.083
trying to keep this restaurant
afloat and my friends employed.

31:51.126 --> 31:52.780
This is my chance to give us
a fresh start.

31:52.823 --> 31:54.782
I'’m not gonna blow it.

31:54.825 --> 31:56.262
Business first.

31:57.567 --> 31:59.178
Of course.

31:59.221 --> 32:00.396
Business first.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.878
You know, all day I'’m surrounded
by people

32:03.922 --> 32:08.448
who are literally-- literally--
hired to make me happy.

32:08.491 --> 32:10.754
- No offense.
- None taken.

32:10.798 --> 32:12.756
Is it so wrong of me
to be interested in someone

32:12.800 --> 32:15.585
who'’s actually not afraid
to speak their mind,

32:15.629 --> 32:17.065
even if they don'’t
agree with you?

32:17.109 --> 32:20.547
Seems like it is,
most of the time.

32:21.678 --> 32:23.245
Yes.

32:23.289 --> 32:25.204
Isn'’t that great?

32:30.035 --> 32:31.645
I'’ll be on my cell
if you need anything.

32:31.688 --> 32:33.952
- Okay.
- [knocking]

32:35.475 --> 32:37.868
That'’s him. I'm not ready.

32:37.912 --> 32:39.000
You'’re fine.

32:39.044 --> 32:40.567
I smell like fried chicken.

32:40.610 --> 32:42.438
I thought you didn'’t care.

32:48.096 --> 32:50.316
Hey, Prince Jack.

32:50.359 --> 32:53.014
I was just headed
over to the hotel.

32:53.058 --> 32:55.408
Oh, we'’re not working
at the hotel.

32:55.451 --> 32:56.800
Maybe later.

32:56.844 --> 32:58.498
I have a surprise for you.

32:58.541 --> 33:02.023
- A surprise? For me?
- Mm-hmm.

33:02.067 --> 33:04.852
Sure, sounds great. Um...

33:04.895 --> 33:05.984
Lead the way.

33:06.027 --> 33:07.681
Okay.

33:12.947 --> 33:14.166
PRINCE JACK:
Are you comfortable?

33:14.209 --> 33:18.822
Oh, yeah, perfect.
I'’m fine.

33:18.866 --> 33:21.738
It'’s just, I don't normally
tool around New York City

33:21.782 --> 33:24.480
in a car like this.

33:24.524 --> 33:26.047
It'’s very cool though.

33:26.091 --> 33:27.831
When I started primary school,

33:27.875 --> 33:30.399
my mother insisted on our driver
taking me every morning.

33:30.443 --> 33:32.401
My mom was just the opposite.

33:32.445 --> 33:34.403
She let us walk to school
every day.

33:34.447 --> 33:36.884
She said the fresh air
would do us some good.

33:36.927 --> 33:39.756
Only time she ever drove us
to school was when it rained.

33:39.800 --> 33:42.150
My mother wouldn'’t dream of
letting me out of her sight.

33:42.194 --> 33:46.067
Then one day
I decided I was tired

33:46.111 --> 33:47.677
of what people
were saying about me,

33:47.721 --> 33:49.766
saying that I was lucky.

33:49.810 --> 33:53.118
So one morning,
I got up early,

33:53.161 --> 33:56.338
made my own breakfast
and took my bike.

33:56.382 --> 34:00.821
I pedaled so fast downhill,
all the way,

34:00.864 --> 34:02.388
wind ripping through my hair.

34:02.431 --> 34:03.998
She must have gotten
a heart attack.

34:04.042 --> 34:07.654
She had the entire Kingsguard
out looking for me.

34:07.697 --> 34:09.960
How was it?

34:10.004 --> 34:13.007
Compared to riding
in a limousine?

34:13.051 --> 34:15.226
It was--
It was glorious.

34:15.270 --> 34:17.925
You know, every now and then,
I'’d sneak out and go for a ride.

34:17.967 --> 34:20.754
Just go wherever the day
would take me.

34:20.797 --> 34:22.451
Oh, you can pull over here.

34:29.023 --> 34:31.199
- I can'’t see anything.
- Who'’s in there?

34:31.243 --> 34:33.158
I can'’t see nobody.

34:35.116 --> 34:37.074
What'’s this all about?
Who are these photographers?

34:37.118 --> 34:39.599
JACK: It'’s nothing, really.
Same old routine.

34:39.641 --> 34:41.469
Someone must'’ve leaked
my itinerary.

34:41.514 --> 34:43.907
It happens.

34:43.951 --> 34:47.563
Follow my lead.
It'’s gonna be fine. Come on.

34:47.607 --> 34:50.088
He'’s opening the door. Prince!
Right here! Here, here!

34:50.130 --> 34:53.134
Prince, let me get a shot.
Who'’s the girl?

34:53.178 --> 34:56.050
Who'’s the woman? Prince, hey!
Turn around!

34:56.094 --> 34:57.312
Miss lady! Miss lady!

34:57.356 --> 34:59.880
Come on, Prince!
Hey, look at the camera!

34:59.923 --> 35:03.536
Miss lady! Prince! Come on!
This way! Prince,
Come on, man! Prince!

35:05.712 --> 35:07.322
Sorry about that.

35:07.366 --> 35:08.889
Does that always happen to you?

35:08.932 --> 35:10.630
Yeah, I'’m afraid so.

35:12.240 --> 35:13.633
What is this?

35:13.676 --> 35:15.243
Well, the thought
did occur to me

35:15.287 --> 35:17.985
that it might be challenging,
preparing for our guests

35:18.028 --> 35:21.206
in the back of your cozy
little restaurant.

35:21.249 --> 35:23.164
Is that what you think?

35:23.208 --> 35:25.906
I just thought a larger space
might help.

35:25.949 --> 35:28.648
So all this is mine?

35:28.691 --> 35:30.606
If you want it.

35:32.521 --> 35:34.349
It'’s too much.

35:34.393 --> 35:38.962
It'’s just an assortment of
chrome, porcelain, tiny motors.

35:39.006 --> 35:44.838
But the real magic...
happens here.

35:44.881 --> 35:47.710
Thank you,
but it'’s very important to me

35:47.754 --> 35:51.192
that my restaurant
does all the work.

35:51.236 --> 35:52.715
Your menu, your way.

35:52.759 --> 35:54.630
That was our deal.

35:54.674 --> 35:57.285
You certainly drive a hard
bargain for such a young lady.

35:57.329 --> 36:01.028
That depends on how badly
you want me.

36:01.071 --> 36:02.595
Touché.

36:02.638 --> 36:05.337
So would you like to continue
with the tour?

36:05.380 --> 36:06.947
There'’s more?

36:06.990 --> 36:09.602
You would like to see the venue,
wouldn'’t you?

36:09.645 --> 36:11.865
Yeah, that would be helpful.

36:11.908 --> 36:13.649
Okay, this way.

36:20.743 --> 36:24.399
Last year, we had servers
floating throughout this hall.

36:24.443 --> 36:25.705
Hmm.

36:25.748 --> 36:29.230
Creating a veritable
moving feast.

36:29.274 --> 36:31.580
Everything came to you.

36:31.624 --> 36:34.061
Are you familiar
with this museum?

36:34.104 --> 36:36.455
Of course.

36:36.498 --> 36:37.760
Fourth grade field trip.

36:37.804 --> 36:40.241
Ah.

36:40.285 --> 36:43.679
That'’s where I first saw this.

36:43.723 --> 36:45.420
You like this one?

36:45.464 --> 36:47.074
Took an art class
in high school,

36:47.117 --> 36:51.252
and I fell in love with it
ever since.

36:51.296 --> 36:52.732
Tell me about it.

36:52.775 --> 36:55.256
It'’s called
"Woman Against the World,"

36:55.300 --> 36:58.390
one of Parker Logan'’s
last pieces.

36:58.433 --> 37:00.043
He was an impressionistic
photographer

37:00.087 --> 37:02.481
in the early days
of the Great Depression.

37:02.524 --> 37:04.831
Exactly.

37:07.877 --> 37:13.100
You know, I used to spend hours
just staring at this woman,

37:13.143 --> 37:16.973
all alone, ready to take on
an entire city.

37:18.845 --> 37:20.629
And yet she still stands there.

37:22.718 --> 37:25.982
Defiant, independent.

37:26.026 --> 37:29.159
Maybe what you really see
is yourself.

37:32.119 --> 37:34.034
You think so?

37:34.077 --> 37:37.124
Yeah, I do.

37:55.360 --> 37:56.796
Your palace awaits, milady.

37:56.839 --> 37:58.188
Thank you, Your Highness.

38:02.236 --> 38:03.411
See you tomorrow?

38:03.455 --> 38:05.370
I'’ll be there with bells on.

38:05.413 --> 38:09.635
Bells on?
Is that a Christmas thing?

38:09.678 --> 38:10.897
It'’s just an expression.

38:10.940 --> 38:11.898
Okay.

38:16.859 --> 38:17.860
Goodbye.

38:17.904 --> 38:19.427
Goodbye.

38:48.674 --> 38:50.632
Thank you, Ferdinand.

38:59.598 --> 39:00.990
[gags]

39:01.034 --> 39:01.948
[coughs]

39:03.515 --> 39:05.865
Where is the king?

39:05.908 --> 39:09.172
I believe he'’s in the middle
of his tennis lesson, ma'’am.

39:09.216 --> 39:11.044
Fetch him immediately.

39:11.087 --> 39:13.699
He asked not to be disturbed.

39:13.742 --> 39:15.962
Have you watched him
play tennis?

39:16.005 --> 39:17.964
I'’ve seen a better swing
on a playground.

39:18.007 --> 39:19.052
Chop chop.

39:27.930 --> 39:30.933
Gideon Oliver
is here to see you, ma'’am.

39:30.977 --> 39:35.068
I don'’t suppose this morning
could get any worse.

39:36.939 --> 39:40.639
Oh, Mr. Oliver,
to what do we owe this pleasure?

39:40.682 --> 39:43.076
Do you any idea
what your son'’s been up to?

39:43.119 --> 39:45.295
Well, at this point,
I'’m fairly certain

39:45.339 --> 39:47.297
that the entire
Western world knows

39:47.341 --> 39:49.952
- what my son has been up to.
- No, that he sacked me.

39:49.996 --> 39:51.780
He did what?

39:51.824 --> 39:55.001
Replaced me with that
no-talent hack from Brooklyn.

39:55.044 --> 39:57.656
Mr. Oliver,

39:57.699 --> 40:01.311
I am certain that if my son
sought to replace your services,

40:01.355 --> 40:03.139
it was for good reason.

40:03.183 --> 40:06.578
I told Ferdinand
I didn'’t want to be disturbed.

40:06.621 --> 40:08.928
I mean, what'’s the purpose of
having an indoor tennis court

40:08.971 --> 40:12.584
if you can'’t at least play one
match without being interrupted?

40:12.627 --> 40:14.281
It'’s not like you were winning.

40:14.324 --> 40:16.631
It'’s not whether you win
or lose, my dear.

40:16.675 --> 40:18.938
It'’s how you play the game,
you see.

40:18.981 --> 40:21.331
Well, then you were
definitely losing.

40:21.375 --> 40:24.160
What exactly
is the urgency here?

40:24.204 --> 40:25.858
Your son fired me.

40:25.901 --> 40:28.556
Oh. Sorry to hear that.

40:28.600 --> 40:30.123
And who are you?

40:30.166 --> 40:32.255
Oh, Connor,
this is Gideon Oliver,

40:32.299 --> 40:35.520
the caterer for this year'’s
annual Christmas Eve banquet.

40:35.563 --> 40:37.304
Former caterer.

40:37.347 --> 40:39.567
- Ferdinand.
- Ma'’am?

40:39.611 --> 40:43.136
Please have Mr. Oliver
wait outside.

40:43.179 --> 40:45.791
But the situation
hasn'’t been rectified.

40:45.834 --> 40:46.966
Good day, sir.

40:52.624 --> 40:58.151
Now please tell me that that
self-important celebrity chef

40:58.194 --> 41:01.981
was not the reason
you interrupted my game.

41:02.024 --> 41:04.418
Unfortunately not.

41:06.551 --> 41:07.987
Oh.

41:08.030 --> 41:10.772
Oh.

41:10.816 --> 41:13.688
Well... she'’s lovely.

41:13.732 --> 41:15.647
She'’s a commoner.

41:15.690 --> 41:18.998
So what?
She'’s just a caterer.

41:19.041 --> 41:21.827
It'’s not like Oliver out there's
the Duke of Essex.

41:21.870 --> 41:25.700
True, but the news media
isn'’t treating Gideon Oliver

41:25.744 --> 41:28.137
like a member
of the royal family.

41:28.181 --> 41:30.183
The press loves a good rumor,
and that'’s all this is.

41:30.226 --> 41:32.968
I'’m sure there's nothing going
on between the two of them.

41:33.012 --> 41:34.492
Why should there be?

41:34.535 --> 41:37.886
Because she'’s pretty,
and he'’s single.

41:37.930 --> 41:39.453
That'’s why.

41:39.497 --> 41:42.108
Well, she is very pretty,
don'’t you think?

41:42.151 --> 41:45.546
She'’s an American commoner.
It'’s insulting.

41:45.590 --> 41:48.593
Insulting? To whom, you?

41:48.636 --> 41:52.945
Insulting to hundreds of years
of tradition, that'’s who.

41:52.988 --> 41:54.686
Oh.

41:54.729 --> 41:57.645
What in the world
am I gonna tell the press?

41:57.689 --> 42:01.301
That we wish our son
nothing but happiness,

42:01.344 --> 42:04.478
and we support him in whatever
decisions he might make.

42:04.522 --> 42:07.176
So we lie.

42:07.220 --> 42:09.004
- Precisely.
- Oh.

42:09.048 --> 42:11.441
Now if you'’ll excuse me,
the score was thirty to nil,

42:11.485 --> 42:13.443
but I think I can catch up.

42:13.487 --> 42:16.751
In tennis, it'’s called love.

42:16.795 --> 42:18.274
Oh.

42:20.755 --> 42:23.802
Perhaps that'’s what they
call it in America too.

42:31.723 --> 42:32.854
- Morning.
- Morning.

42:32.898 --> 42:34.377
- Good morning.
- Morning.

42:35.596 --> 42:36.902
Hey, Al.

42:36.945 --> 42:41.036
Hey! Looks like someone
made a new friend.

42:41.080 --> 42:42.037
Pardon?

42:42.081 --> 42:44.779
Seriously, good for you.

42:44.823 --> 42:47.347
I'’m not sure what you mean.

42:47.390 --> 42:48.348
Come on.

42:50.568 --> 42:52.221
Huh?

42:54.397 --> 42:56.312
[laughs]

42:58.663 --> 43:00.099
Where you going?

43:00.142 --> 43:03.058
- Okay, so potatoes are--
- Hailee!

43:03.102 --> 43:04.233
Hailee.

43:04.277 --> 43:06.366
- Your Highness.
- Look at this.

43:06.409 --> 43:08.890
"Prince John'’s
new mystery woman?"

43:08.934 --> 43:10.805
"The Princess of Brooklyn?"

43:12.198 --> 43:13.678
Well, you finally done it.

43:13.721 --> 43:15.375
You put the restaurant
on the map.

43:15.418 --> 43:17.159
But I'’m thinking maybe
you should change the name

43:17.203 --> 43:19.422
to something
a little more grand,

43:19.466 --> 43:22.643
like the Royal Princess Cafe.

43:22.687 --> 43:24.384
[chuckles]

43:25.864 --> 43:27.605
Seriously, I'’m just a caterer!

43:27.648 --> 43:29.302
How could they say
something like that?

43:29.345 --> 43:30.956
People love to gossip.

43:30.999 --> 43:33.306
You'’re the new mystery woman
seen out and about

43:33.349 --> 43:37.179
with the handsome, dare I say,
available Prince Charming?

43:37.223 --> 43:39.094
I gotta go.

43:39.138 --> 43:40.835
So you'’re saying it's not true.

43:40.879 --> 43:43.272
Just can it, will you?

43:44.883 --> 43:47.494
My, my, my.

43:47.537 --> 43:49.191
Okay.

43:49.235 --> 43:50.671
- Are you serious?
- Just one, ma'’am.

43:50.715 --> 43:52.717
- No, no, no, no.
- Just one, just one.

43:52.760 --> 43:54.588
How long have you known
the prince?

43:54.632 --> 43:56.634
Hey, ho-hold it!

44:01.726 --> 44:04.206
Oh. Hi.

44:04.250 --> 44:06.208
What'’s the matter?
You look surprised.

44:06.252 --> 44:07.557
I was expecting Rupert.

44:07.601 --> 44:10.169
I gave him the morning off.
Come in.

44:13.302 --> 44:14.695
I thought we could
finalize the menu.

44:14.739 --> 44:16.392
Been thinking about
some of your ideas.

44:16.436 --> 44:17.959
Have you seen this?

44:18.003 --> 44:19.961
Yes. I'’m terribly sorry.

44:20.005 --> 44:22.181
These reporters will jump at
anything to sell a magazine.

44:22.224 --> 44:25.271
But the "Princess of Brooklyn?"

44:25.314 --> 44:27.012
Has a nice ring to it,
don'’t you think?

44:27.055 --> 44:29.797
Is that all you can say,
that it has a nice ring to it?

44:29.841 --> 44:32.408
What-- What do you
want me to say?

44:32.452 --> 44:35.368
You know, people see me with
a new woman they don'’t know,

44:35.411 --> 44:36.891
and suddenly
the guessing games begin.

44:36.935 --> 44:39.546
People are following me.

44:39.589 --> 44:42.157
Isn'’t that what you wanted?
Notoriety?

44:42.201 --> 44:43.724
Okay, you'’ve got it.

44:43.768 --> 44:45.813
Yes, I wanted to put
my restaurant on the map,

44:45.857 --> 44:47.162
but not like this.

44:47.206 --> 44:48.424
Okay, don'’t worry.

44:48.468 --> 44:50.252
This will all blow over
in a few days.

44:50.296 --> 44:52.602
I am afraid to show my face
on the street.

44:52.646 --> 44:55.083
Okay, then let'’s
get out of here,

44:55.127 --> 44:58.086
and we can go somewhere and work
on the menu somewhere else.

44:58.130 --> 45:01.133
All right,
but where would we even go?

45:01.176 --> 45:03.091
Ladies'’ choice.

45:03.135 --> 45:06.399
As long as we sneak out
the back, my SUV'’s outside.

45:09.445 --> 45:12.405
Okay. I know just the place.

45:12.448 --> 45:13.885
Okay.

45:24.896 --> 45:26.854
All right, all clear,
let'’s go.

45:49.964 --> 45:52.140
This is gorgeous.

45:52.184 --> 45:54.664
This is my first time in the
American countryside, you know.

45:54.708 --> 45:57.798
There'’s more to America
than New York City.

45:57.842 --> 45:59.931
You'’re not gonna tell me
where we'’re going, are you?

45:59.974 --> 46:04.152
I'’m gonna take you to see
a small-town Christmas.

46:05.719 --> 46:07.329
Well, that might be a good idea,

46:07.373 --> 46:10.680
but we still do have a lot
of work left to accomplish.

46:10.724 --> 46:13.161
Trust me. It'’ll be worth it.

46:14.380 --> 46:15.903
Take this right up here.

47:08.738 --> 47:10.523
So where are we?

47:10.566 --> 47:11.741
Merryvale.

47:11.785 --> 47:12.917
Merryvale.

47:12.960 --> 47:15.267
Mm-hmm.
This is where my family goes

47:15.310 --> 47:18.052
when they want to get away
for a few days.

47:18.096 --> 47:19.880
Hasn'’t changed a bit.

47:19.924 --> 47:21.664
PRINCE JACK:
It'’s very charming.

47:23.449 --> 47:26.408
Are you ready
for a real Christmas menu?

47:26.452 --> 47:27.888
Absolutely.

47:27.932 --> 47:29.368
This way.

47:31.022 --> 47:32.414
[door chime rings]

47:40.640 --> 47:42.337
It'’s absolutely amazing.

47:51.651 --> 47:53.435
I don'’t believe it.

47:53.479 --> 47:56.569
Prince John of Edgemont
in my diner.

47:56.612 --> 47:57.918
Hello there.

47:57.962 --> 47:59.572
I gotta go get my camera.

47:59.615 --> 48:03.402
So much for
getting away from it all.

48:03.445 --> 48:05.099
You wouldn'’t mind a photo,
would you?

48:05.143 --> 48:06.405
I'’d be delighted.

48:06.448 --> 48:07.754
Say cheese or, you know,

48:07.797 --> 48:08.973
whatever they say
in your country.

48:09.016 --> 48:10.104
Cheese.

48:10.148 --> 48:12.411
- Smile!
- [click]

48:12.454 --> 48:16.241
Oh, my God.
They are never gonna believe me.

48:17.720 --> 48:19.157
Well, this is my friend Jessica.

48:19.200 --> 48:20.636
Hi.

48:20.680 --> 48:23.813
Are you--
You'’re the Princess of Brooklyn.

48:23.857 --> 48:25.511
No, I--

48:25.554 --> 48:28.122
Jessica is actually catering
our royal Christmas banquet.

48:28.166 --> 48:29.776
She is? You are?

48:29.819 --> 48:32.474
Yes, I am.
Now, if you don'’t mind,

48:32.518 --> 48:34.520
would you please get us
two cups of hot cocoa?

48:34.563 --> 48:36.087
Coming right up.

48:38.350 --> 48:39.655
Let'’s...

48:46.227 --> 48:48.577
So is Merryvale
your go-to place

48:48.621 --> 48:51.319
to escape their chaos
of the big city?

48:51.363 --> 48:53.495
Yeah, I guess
you could say that.

48:53.539 --> 48:57.456
It'’s a simpler,
saner kind of a place.

48:57.499 --> 48:59.849
- Hmm.
- Take Christmas, for example.

48:59.893 --> 49:02.635
You have your
gingerbread-house baking,

49:02.678 --> 49:05.899
eggnog, candy canes,
hot chocolate,

49:05.943 --> 49:09.163
honey glazed ham,
yams, cranberry sauce...

49:09.207 --> 49:13.559
Okay, okay.
It all sounds very fattening.

49:13.602 --> 49:15.996
I know,
but what a way to go, right?

49:16.040 --> 49:16.997
[chuckles]

49:18.433 --> 49:20.044
How about you?

49:20.087 --> 49:22.394
Are there any special Christmas
foods where you'’re from?

49:22.437 --> 49:24.135
My family would always
have the kitchen

49:24.178 --> 49:29.531
prepare a whole feast
every year, wherever we were.

49:29.575 --> 49:32.926
Had mince pies, mulled wine,

49:32.970 --> 49:35.842
spiced beef with
Yorkshire pudding.

49:35.885 --> 49:38.018
Brings back memories, huh?

49:38.062 --> 49:40.499
It seemed like they'’d be
cooking for days.

49:40.542 --> 49:43.850
The whole palace would smell
like that for a week.

49:43.893 --> 49:45.983
See what I mean?

49:46.026 --> 49:48.463
Those Christmas comfort foods.

49:48.507 --> 49:51.379
Look at how those memories
just came rushing back

49:51.423 --> 49:53.338
when you thought about
those delights.

49:53.381 --> 49:56.036
Yeah, I see what you mean.

49:56.080 --> 49:58.996
That'’s what we're
gonna be serving.

50:06.525 --> 50:09.049
If we'’re gonna celebrate
Christmas properly,

50:09.093 --> 50:11.008
let'’s transport them
back in time.

50:11.051 --> 50:14.533
And not just visually,
but with all of their senses.

50:14.576 --> 50:17.014
And without all of that
pretentiousness.

50:17.057 --> 50:19.407
Pretentiousness? You know,
you actually might enjoy

50:19.451 --> 50:21.322
living the life of royalty.

50:21.366 --> 50:24.586
I don'’t know. That might be
some girl'’s dream, but not mine.

50:24.630 --> 50:27.633
Never?

50:27.676 --> 50:29.852
I guess I just never identified
with that woman

50:29.896 --> 50:34.074
who just waits around
for her Prince Charming,

50:34.118 --> 50:37.599
for him to sweep her
off her feet.

50:37.643 --> 50:38.687
No offense.

50:38.731 --> 50:40.472
None taken.

50:40.515 --> 50:43.301
Yeah, I believe that
I'’m in charge of my own destiny.

50:43.344 --> 50:44.563
That'’s just the way I like it.

50:44.606 --> 50:45.912
As you say.

50:48.349 --> 50:49.524
Here you go.

50:51.613 --> 50:52.701
Thank you.

50:52.745 --> 50:54.834
Your Highness.

50:57.750 --> 50:59.839
You know, I never thought
I'’d be here,

50:59.882 --> 51:03.582
celebrating Christmas
in a small American town,

51:03.625 --> 51:05.714
yet here we are.

51:10.980 --> 51:12.939
Wow. This is good.

51:12.982 --> 51:15.724
Mm-hmm.
You haven'’t seen anything yet.

51:15.768 --> 51:17.726
Just wait until it snows.

51:17.770 --> 51:19.902
What do you mean, snow?

51:19.946 --> 51:21.774
Oh, come on.

51:21.817 --> 51:26.300
You played in the snow before.
Even as a kid?

51:26.344 --> 51:28.128
Of course.

51:28.172 --> 51:29.738
You'’ve been skiing?

51:29.782 --> 51:33.002
Some. I'’ve had a life
of royal obligations

51:33.046 --> 51:34.352
and services, you know.

51:34.395 --> 51:35.962
Mm. Sledding?

51:36.005 --> 51:37.181
Toboggan team.

51:37.224 --> 51:38.530
How about ice skating?

51:38.573 --> 51:40.880
European Junior Olympics.

51:40.923 --> 51:43.361
Yeah, you'’ve been around.

51:43.404 --> 51:45.014
When you represent the crown,

51:45.058 --> 51:47.191
there are certain standards
you must meet.

51:47.234 --> 51:51.108
There'’s no room for slacking off
or for not being the best.

51:51.151 --> 51:54.589
And there'’s no room for--
for any fun either.

51:54.633 --> 51:57.157
Everything'’s a job.

51:57.201 --> 52:01.205
I almost feel sorry for you,
except not really.

52:01.248 --> 52:02.902
Okay, let'’s go.

52:02.945 --> 52:04.121
We'’re leaving?

52:04.164 --> 52:05.687
Yeah. Going for a walk.

52:05.731 --> 52:06.775
Okay.

52:10.388 --> 52:12.346
So let'’s talk about Christmas.

52:12.390 --> 52:13.869
What about it?

52:13.913 --> 52:16.785
How did you incorporate it
into your banquet?

52:16.829 --> 52:19.527
Well, we put a big tree
in the center of the room.

52:19.571 --> 52:21.355
It was pretty.

52:21.399 --> 52:22.487
Is that it?

52:22.530 --> 52:24.053
Yeah. I think by Christmas Eve,

52:24.097 --> 52:26.491
people are wishing
the holidays were over.

52:26.534 --> 52:28.188
Well, not me.

52:28.232 --> 52:30.625
Not now, not ever.

52:30.669 --> 52:32.845
Do you remember
what it was like

52:32.888 --> 52:34.803
to experience Christmas
as a kid?

52:34.847 --> 52:38.546
I do indeed.
It was wonderful, if fleeting.

52:38.590 --> 52:40.896
My parents would always move
quickly into the New Year.

52:40.940 --> 52:43.072
They never let Christmas
linger in our home.

52:43.116 --> 52:46.511
Oh, gosh, that'’s funny.
My folks were just the opposite.

52:46.554 --> 52:48.643
Christmas lasted
well into January.

52:48.687 --> 52:52.865
That tree didn'’t come down
until it had to.

52:52.908 --> 52:55.520
You know what?
Let me show you something.

52:59.741 --> 53:05.007
♪♪

53:05.051 --> 53:09.621
♪ Oh, we wish you
a merry Christmas ♪

53:09.664 --> 53:11.971
- I could spend all day here.
- Yeah?

53:12.014 --> 53:14.060
JESSICA: Oh, yeah.

53:14.103 --> 53:15.366
Oh, yeah.

53:15.409 --> 53:17.019
Yeah.

53:17.063 --> 53:20.109
- Let'’s look over here.
- Yeah.

53:20.153 --> 53:23.591
Isn'’t this Christmas shop
amazing?

53:23.635 --> 53:26.246
I'’ve always loved visiting this
place, Christmas Year-Round.

53:26.290 --> 53:30.032
Christmas in Merryvale
certainly is a sight to see.

53:30.076 --> 53:32.905
You know, this place
feels more like home to me.

53:32.948 --> 53:34.907
We didn'’t move to the city
until I was in high school,

53:34.950 --> 53:36.909
when my dad got transferred.

53:36.952 --> 53:38.693
I grew up in Hudson Valley.

53:38.737 --> 53:42.044
I see. And did you enjoy an
old-fashioned Christmas there?

53:42.088 --> 53:44.046
Oh, of course I did,

53:44.090 --> 53:47.180
but what I mostly remember
is my grandma'’s kitchen

53:47.224 --> 53:48.834
and the wonderful smells.

53:48.877 --> 53:51.706
All the Christmas treats baking,

53:51.750 --> 53:57.364
all the smells blending into one
unmistakable sensory experience.

54:00.454 --> 54:02.935
That'’s what's gonna work for us
this year.

54:05.633 --> 54:07.244
Uh, yeah.

54:09.071 --> 54:10.595
I do like the concept.

54:10.638 --> 54:13.859
I just think my mother
would be quite horrified.

54:13.902 --> 54:15.687
Wow.

54:15.730 --> 54:19.125
Sounds like your mother doesn'’t
really understand Christmas.

54:19.168 --> 54:20.866
There'’s a lot of things
she doesn'’t understand,

54:20.909 --> 54:23.172
including me.

54:23.216 --> 54:24.739
How about your father?

54:24.783 --> 54:27.089
My father is
the king of Edgemont.

54:27.133 --> 54:28.656
He has the bloodline,

54:28.700 --> 54:30.919
but as the American phrase goes,

54:30.963 --> 54:34.183
my mother wears the slacks
in the family.

54:34.227 --> 54:35.272
Close enough.

54:37.665 --> 54:40.973
Everything is just so with her.

54:41.016 --> 54:44.281
The monarchy, the tradition,
the banquet.

54:44.324 --> 54:46.021
[sighs]

54:46.065 --> 54:49.503
Even her own son'’s social life.

54:49.547 --> 54:51.331
Wow.

54:51.375 --> 54:53.333
Two years ago,
she conspired that I be married

54:53.377 --> 54:55.335
to Lady Eliza of Devon.

54:55.379 --> 54:58.643
It was to be the social event
of the season.

54:58.686 --> 55:00.993
So are you?

55:01.036 --> 55:02.995
Married? Heavens no.

55:03.038 --> 55:05.345
That woman is a dreadful shrew.

55:05.389 --> 55:07.216
Talk about entitled.

55:07.260 --> 55:11.090
She'’s pretty to look at,
but she doesn'’t mean well.

55:11.133 --> 55:14.049
And while I know it would have
made my mother happy,

55:14.093 --> 55:16.574
it didn'’t even come close
to resembling love.

55:16.617 --> 55:20.665
That'’s assuming you know
what love is when you see it.

55:20.708 --> 55:24.364
Perhaps so, but I certainly know
when I don'’t see it.

55:26.018 --> 55:27.454
I bet you do.

55:27.498 --> 55:30.065
All right, shall we?

55:33.068 --> 55:34.287
[phone rings]

55:36.071 --> 55:37.246
Oh, it'’s Rupert.

55:37.290 --> 55:40.162
Probably wondering where I am.

55:40.206 --> 55:43.514
- Well, we'’ll let him wonder.
- [giggles]

55:43.557 --> 55:44.558
What?

55:44.602 --> 55:46.473
Uh, nothing. It'’s just...

55:46.517 --> 55:48.736
You don'’t really act
like a prince sometimes.

55:48.780 --> 55:50.042
And how do I act?

55:50.085 --> 55:51.478
I don'’t know.

55:51.522 --> 55:53.045
Peter Pan, maybe?

55:53.088 --> 55:54.916
Peter Pan?

55:54.960 --> 55:57.354
Okay, well, I don'’t know whether
to be flattered or insulted.

55:57.397 --> 55:58.616
- Oh, oh!
- [glass shatters]

55:58.659 --> 56:01.445
Easy, easy, lad.
Are you okay?

56:01.488 --> 56:03.360
There you are.
Now I caught ya!

56:04.578 --> 56:06.406
Excuse me, what'’s going on?

56:06.450 --> 56:08.756
This boy here stole something
from my store.

56:08.800 --> 56:09.757
Oh, no.

56:11.977 --> 56:13.979
I'’m afraid it's broken.

56:14.022 --> 56:16.895
[sighs] You know what?
His mother'’s inside.

56:16.938 --> 56:19.332
- She'’ll have to pay for it.
- Please don'’t tell her.

56:19.376 --> 56:22.988
Perhaps I could be of some help,
if we all just go inside.

56:23.031 --> 56:25.599
All right, let'’s go.

56:31.953 --> 56:34.608
So what is this all about?

56:34.652 --> 56:37.568
The boy--
His father'’s in the military.

56:37.611 --> 56:40.745
Been deployed for two years.
[sighs]

56:40.788 --> 56:43.312
Money'’s tight.
He stole the mirror

56:43.356 --> 56:45.402
to give to his mother
as a Christmas gift.

56:45.445 --> 56:48.579
She'’s very upset,

56:48.622 --> 56:51.756
but with no father
around the house,

56:51.799 --> 56:53.584
I mean, what can you do?

56:53.627 --> 56:57.457
Well, I'’m assuming
this should be more than enough

56:57.501 --> 56:58.893
to cover the loss
of your mirror.

56:58.937 --> 57:00.939
That'’s more than enough.

57:00.982 --> 57:03.855
Then there'’s no need for
any of this to go any further.

57:03.898 --> 57:05.596
No, there isn'’t.

57:05.639 --> 57:07.467
- Good.
- Thank you.

57:07.511 --> 57:08.947
You'’re welcome.

57:12.907 --> 57:16.215
Here you are, Tommy.
Everything'’s been taken care of.

57:16.258 --> 57:18.347
I hope you'’ve learned something
from all of this.

57:18.391 --> 57:20.393
I'’m Mrs. Carter,

57:20.437 --> 57:24.310
and I want to thank you
for what you'’ve just done.

57:24.353 --> 57:26.486
If only his father was here.

57:26.530 --> 57:28.357
I heard he'’s overseas.

57:28.401 --> 57:32.274
So long now, I don'’t even know
if Tommy will recognize him.

57:32.318 --> 57:36.844
We have each other,
and that will have to be enough.

57:38.411 --> 57:40.369
Come on, Tommy,
say thank you.

57:40.413 --> 57:41.370
Thank you.

57:41.414 --> 57:42.937
You'’re welcome.

57:46.245 --> 57:48.203
That was very kind of you.

57:48.247 --> 57:49.509
It'’s the least I could do.

57:49.553 --> 57:51.511
You didn'’t have to do anything.

57:51.555 --> 57:52.991
A wise man once said,

57:53.034 --> 57:55.733
"Doing nothing is
the undoing of ourselves."

57:57.691 --> 57:58.910
Plus, it'’s Christmas.

58:00.433 --> 58:02.653
- That it is.
- Come on.

58:04.524 --> 58:06.613
You constantly amaze me.

58:06.657 --> 58:08.528
I thought I had you
all figured out,

58:08.572 --> 58:10.530
but there'’s a lot more
going on here.

58:10.574 --> 58:13.577
Jessica, I was born lucky.

58:13.620 --> 58:16.101
You know, I want to share
my gratitude with everybody.

58:16.144 --> 58:18.669
And I mean everybody,
not just--

58:18.712 --> 58:19.887
Your subjects?

58:19.931 --> 58:22.063
Please. I detest that word.

58:22.107 --> 58:24.065
It'’s-- It's dehumanizing.

58:24.109 --> 58:27.068
Regardless, you have a very kind
and generous soul.

58:27.112 --> 58:28.940
If only I could do more though.

58:28.983 --> 58:33.684
If our guests can pay $1,000
to attend our silly banquet,

58:33.727 --> 58:36.861
then they should be able
to do the same.

58:36.904 --> 58:38.384
Come on.

58:40.995 --> 58:44.521

Well, here we are.

59:27.564 --> 59:29.957
Yup, here we are.

59:30.001 --> 59:33.004
Thank you for sharing
that experience with me today.

59:33.047 --> 59:34.483
You'’re welcome.

59:34.527 --> 59:36.921
And now back to the hotel
for me

59:36.964 --> 59:38.966
to face the music.

59:40.968 --> 59:42.143
See you tomorrow?

59:42.187 --> 59:44.798
I will wear bells.

59:44.842 --> 59:46.278
Close enough.

59:49.716 --> 59:51.805
You keep doing that,
I just might get used to it.

59:51.849 --> 59:53.285
Is that an encouragement?

59:53.328 --> 59:55.940
Farewell, sweet prince.

01:00:07.691 --> 01:00:10.737
No, no, we'’ve checked there.

01:00:10.781 --> 01:00:15.307
The subway?
You can'’t be serious! No--

01:00:15.350 --> 01:00:16.438
[sighs]

01:00:16.482 --> 01:00:19.441
Never mind. We'’ve found him.

01:00:21.226 --> 01:00:24.446
Just what do you think
you'’re doing?

01:00:24.490 --> 01:00:25.665
Research.

01:00:25.709 --> 01:00:27.624
Research?
Do you have any idea

01:00:27.667 --> 01:00:30.539
how many people I have out there
looking for you?

01:00:30.583 --> 01:00:33.934
Rupert, I'’m a big boy.
I can take care of myself.

01:00:33.978 --> 01:00:35.544
This isn'’t about whether or not
you can tie your shoes

01:00:35.588 --> 01:00:37.372
or read a clock.

01:00:37.416 --> 01:00:41.725
You were out there alone
in the city without security.

01:00:41.768 --> 01:00:43.814
I wasn'’t alone.

01:00:43.857 --> 01:00:46.425
Oh, of course not.

01:00:46.468 --> 01:00:49.123
Tell me, if an incident
had happened,

01:00:49.167 --> 01:00:51.648
would she have been able
to help you?

01:00:51.691 --> 01:00:53.301
I think you'’d be surprised
to find out

01:00:53.345 --> 01:00:56.000
exactly how capable Jessica is.

01:00:57.218 --> 01:01:00.526
So you are
in love with her.

01:01:00.569 --> 01:01:03.181
Why don'’t you just admit it?

01:01:03.224 --> 01:01:05.357
No, no, no, don'’t,
don'’t say it.

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:07.054
I'’ve never met
anyone like her before.

01:01:07.098 --> 01:01:09.709
That'’s because
you'’ve never dated anyone

01:01:09.753 --> 01:01:12.059
outside of your mother'’s
ivory dollhouse.

01:01:12.103 --> 01:01:14.366
She'’s a breath of fresh air,
Rupert.

01:01:14.409 --> 01:01:16.847
Finally, a woman
who'’s independent,

01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:20.807
who fights for what she wants,
who knows her own mind.

01:01:20.851 --> 01:01:24.681
A woman you have to chase,
but it'’s so worth it.

01:01:26.552 --> 01:01:30.730
And what happens
when the banquet is over,

01:01:30.774 --> 01:01:33.428
and you return to Edgemont
alone?

01:01:33.472 --> 01:01:37.345
I don'’t know,
but what I do know is...

01:01:37.389 --> 01:01:39.347
that this year'’s
gonna be different,

01:01:39.391 --> 01:01:41.306
and that is because of Jessica.

01:01:42.916 --> 01:01:44.788
I see.

01:01:44.831 --> 01:01:46.441
Hmm.

01:01:46.485 --> 01:01:48.748
Your parents arrive tomorrow.

01:01:48.792 --> 01:01:50.750
You don'’t need to remind me.

01:01:50.794 --> 01:01:56.016
I only hope your new girlfriend
is ready.

01:02:19.823 --> 01:02:23.914
I don'’t understand why we can't
just let the boy individuate.

01:02:23.957 --> 01:02:26.786
It'’s not about his independence.

01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:30.616
How about we just think about
what'’s best for him, huh?

01:02:30.659 --> 01:02:33.880
I want you to consider
what is best for your kingdom,

01:02:33.924 --> 01:02:35.490
for your monarchy.

01:02:35.534 --> 01:02:38.232
How about a prince
who is happy?

01:02:38.276 --> 01:02:41.148
He will learn to be happy.
I know I did.

01:02:41.192 --> 01:02:43.890
Yes, but he'’s hardly a child.

01:02:43.934 --> 01:02:46.850
Wait. Does that mean there was
a time when you were not happy?

01:02:49.374 --> 01:02:52.029
Your Majesty?

01:02:52.072 --> 01:02:54.553
Lady Eliza has arrived.

01:02:54.596 --> 01:02:56.555
Just in time.

01:02:56.598 --> 01:02:58.644
Alice, what have you done?

01:02:58.687 --> 01:03:01.386
Ensure that the great
monarchy of Edgemont

01:03:01.429 --> 01:03:04.824
would continue on course
for generations to come.

01:03:07.044 --> 01:03:08.393
Your Majesty.

01:03:08.436 --> 01:03:11.657
Lady Eliza,
lovely to see you again.

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:14.616
I must admit, I was surprised
to hear from you.

01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:16.096
I had read a rumor

01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:18.795
that the prince had taken
a new lady friend

01:03:18.838 --> 01:03:21.667
without so much as
even a word to me.

01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:24.017
Oh, fake news.

01:03:25.714 --> 01:03:28.717
Ferdinand, please help
Lady Eliza with her bags.

01:03:31.024 --> 01:03:34.636
Alice, what is she doing here?

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:36.160
Would it not be appropriate

01:03:36.203 --> 01:03:39.032
to invite the only daughter
of Lord Willoughby

01:03:39.076 --> 01:03:43.297
to attend the annual Christmas
Eve banquet in New York?

01:03:43.341 --> 01:03:45.256
No, actually, it would not.

01:03:45.299 --> 01:03:46.823
Oh, you worry too much.

01:03:46.866 --> 01:03:50.478
Ah, come.
We have a plane to catch.

01:04:00.401 --> 01:04:01.881
I'’ve written out
the final menu.

01:04:01.925 --> 01:04:03.448
Really?

01:04:03.491 --> 01:04:05.580
We'’re gonna make this
a Christmas to remember.

01:04:05.624 --> 01:04:08.018
- The prince is okay with this?
- Of course.

01:04:08.061 --> 01:04:09.889
Hailee, I was just
looking for you.

01:04:09.933 --> 01:04:11.586
I think we'’re gonna need a few
more things from the store.

01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:14.285
A package just arrived for you.
It'’s up front.

01:04:14.328 --> 01:04:15.329
For me?

01:04:15.373 --> 01:04:17.679
It'’s from you-know-who.

01:04:17.723 --> 01:04:18.985
Really?

01:04:20.944 --> 01:04:22.336
Um, yeah. Where is it?

01:04:40.572 --> 01:04:44.793
"To the most defiant
and independent woman I know.

01:04:44.837 --> 01:04:47.361
Sincerely, Jack."

01:04:49.233 --> 01:04:50.408
No.

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.809
I can'’t believe it.

01:05:00.853 --> 01:05:02.463
He actually got it.

01:05:02.507 --> 01:05:04.291
Is that the original?

01:05:04.335 --> 01:05:06.424
I can'’t accept this.

01:05:06.467 --> 01:05:08.252
What are you doing?

01:05:08.295 --> 01:05:11.168
I'’m telling him
I can'’t accept it.

01:05:11.211 --> 01:05:13.344
You obviously mean
a lot to him

01:05:13.387 --> 01:05:15.346
for him to give you
a gift like that.

01:05:15.389 --> 01:05:16.956
It doesn'’t matter.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.740
Yeah, of course it does.

01:05:18.784 --> 01:05:21.352
I think the question is,
what does he mean to you?

01:05:21.395 --> 01:05:24.964
[phone ringing]

01:05:25.008 --> 01:05:26.183
It'’s him.

01:05:26.226 --> 01:05:28.489
Uh, what should I say?

01:05:28.533 --> 01:05:30.361
You could start with
"Thank you."

01:05:30.404 --> 01:05:31.928
Right.

01:05:34.452 --> 01:05:35.670
Hello, Jack.

01:05:35.714 --> 01:05:38.499
Good morning.

01:05:38.543 --> 01:05:40.937
Hi. I got your present.

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:42.416
I can'’t believe you did that.

01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:44.244
Well, it'’s not the one
from the museum,

01:05:44.288 --> 01:05:47.291
but it'’s a numbered edition
from the original negative.

01:05:47.334 --> 01:05:48.640
Hope you like it.

01:05:48.683 --> 01:05:53.079
Yes. Thank you.
It means a lot.

01:05:53.123 --> 01:05:55.864
Actually, the real reason I was
calling was that my parents

01:05:55.908 --> 01:05:57.649
are flying in this afternoon
for the banquet.

01:05:57.692 --> 01:05:59.999
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:06:00.043 --> 01:06:02.045
I would very much like them
to meet you.

01:06:02.088 --> 01:06:03.742
I know you have
a lot of prep work going on,

01:06:03.785 --> 01:06:06.875
but are you available
for dinner tonight?

01:06:06.919 --> 01:06:08.138
Dinner?

01:06:09.617 --> 01:06:12.185
With your parents?

01:06:12.229 --> 01:06:15.319
Um, you know, Jack, I--

01:06:15.362 --> 01:06:18.148
Isn'’t it--
I don'’t think that's too wise.

01:06:18.191 --> 01:06:21.238
Don'’t we still have like
a whole bunch of stuff to do?

01:06:21.281 --> 01:06:23.327
[chuckles]
It'’ll be fine.

01:06:23.370 --> 01:06:25.459
And your parents
are invited as well.

01:06:25.503 --> 01:06:31.030
Okay, um, I will see
what I can do about that.

01:06:31.074 --> 01:06:35.469
Perfect. I'’ll send a car,
say like half-past five?

01:06:35.513 --> 01:06:37.036
Okay, it'’s a date.

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:39.125
No, that'’s not
what I meant to say.

01:06:39.169 --> 01:06:41.040
Yeah, it'’s a date.

01:06:41.084 --> 01:06:43.173
Okay, see you then. Bye.

01:06:47.699 --> 01:06:53.313
I'’m having dinner with
the king and queen tonight.

01:06:53.357 --> 01:06:56.882
He invited you to dinner
with his parents.

01:06:56.925 --> 01:06:59.319
You know what that means,
don'’t you?

01:06:59.363 --> 01:07:02.540
It means
I'’m absolutely terrified.

01:07:38.141 --> 01:07:39.664
GARY: I love this hotel.

01:07:39.707 --> 01:07:42.362
It'’s so beautiful
around Christmastime.

01:07:42.406 --> 01:07:44.364
- Wow.
- Look at the decorations.

01:07:44.408 --> 01:07:45.365
Yeah.

01:07:48.499 --> 01:07:49.456
Hello.

01:07:51.502 --> 01:07:52.807
You look incredible.

01:07:52.851 --> 01:07:55.201
Thank you.

01:07:55.245 --> 01:07:59.118
It'’s okay.
There'’s nothing to worry about.

01:07:59.162 --> 01:08:03.166
It'’s just I've never had dinner
before with a king and queen.

01:08:03.209 --> 01:08:05.211
That'’s okay.
I'’ve never had dinner

01:08:05.255 --> 01:08:07.605
with Mr. And Mrs. Burns either.

01:08:07.648 --> 01:08:09.085
[giggles]

01:08:10.521 --> 01:08:11.870
Come, this way.

01:08:11.913 --> 01:08:13.263
They'’re waiting
in the dining room.

01:08:13.306 --> 01:08:14.829
Okay.

01:08:21.923 --> 01:08:23.837
Oh, yes, I'’ve become--

01:08:23.881 --> 01:08:25.100
Oh.

01:08:27.189 --> 01:08:28.626
Thank you.

01:08:30.671 --> 01:08:31.803
Oh.

01:08:33.196 --> 01:08:34.501
Oh, son.

01:08:34.545 --> 01:08:38.723
Mother, Father,
I would like you to meet--

01:08:38.765 --> 01:08:41.508
The Princess of Brooklyn,
I believe they call you.

01:08:41.551 --> 01:08:42.553
Jessica.

01:08:42.595 --> 01:08:44.032
Lovely to finally meet you.

01:08:44.076 --> 01:08:45.555
We'’ve been reading
all about you.

01:08:45.599 --> 01:08:47.035
- Really?
- Yes.

01:08:47.078 --> 01:08:49.299
Mm. Word gets around.

01:08:49.341 --> 01:08:51.562
These are my parents,
Linda and Gary.

01:08:51.604 --> 01:08:54.520
Very nice to meet you,
Your Highnesses.

01:08:54.564 --> 01:08:55.870
Please have a seat.

01:09:00.832 --> 01:09:03.661
We brought a dinner guest
of our own.

01:09:03.703 --> 01:09:05.184
Oh.

01:09:05.228 --> 01:09:07.447
I believe you know
Lady Eliza of Devon.

01:09:07.491 --> 01:09:08.578
Alice.

01:09:12.365 --> 01:09:14.975
Is that theLady Eliza?

01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:16.587
Lady in name only.

01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:18.197
What are you doing here?

01:09:18.241 --> 01:09:19.938
Don'’t be silly.

01:09:19.981 --> 01:09:22.201
I heard that you were hosting
the biggest banquet of the year,

01:09:22.245 --> 01:09:23.594
so I had to see it for myself.

01:09:23.636 --> 01:09:26.684
Oh, you had to
or somebody asked you?

01:09:28.816 --> 01:09:29.948
I'’ve missed you, darling.

01:09:31.732 --> 01:09:33.560
Darling?

01:09:33.604 --> 01:09:34.908
Jack, what'’s going on?

01:09:36.737 --> 01:09:38.652
That'’s precisely
what I would like to know.

01:09:41.264 --> 01:09:44.745
I'’ve read all about
your Christmas comfort menu.

01:09:44.788 --> 01:09:47.008
Jack, surely this is another one
of your clever jokes.

01:09:47.051 --> 01:09:50.925
He'’s always leading people on
with his humorous antics.

01:09:50.969 --> 01:09:52.231
Eliza, please.

01:09:52.274 --> 01:09:54.581
I thought you said it was off.

01:09:54.625 --> 01:09:56.322
It was never on.

01:09:58.194 --> 01:10:01.675
I don'’t know about you,
but I'’m simply famished.

01:10:01.719 --> 01:10:04.112
I agree, Your Majesty.

01:10:04.156 --> 01:10:06.114
Maybe they got some spinach dip.

01:10:07.594 --> 01:10:10.554
Gideon Oliver came to see us.

01:10:10.597 --> 01:10:13.034
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:10:13.078 --> 01:10:15.080
Yes, he told us
what had happened.

01:10:15.123 --> 01:10:16.908
You could'’ve just
asked me directly.

01:10:16.951 --> 01:10:21.129
Perhaps I should have, son,
but I'’ve trusted your judgment.

01:10:21.173 --> 01:10:23.436
You must have
great talent, dear,

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:25.221
to replace a chef like that.

01:10:25.264 --> 01:10:26.657
Yes, she does.

01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:29.355
I presume she can
speak for herself.

01:10:29.399 --> 01:10:31.314
What are you doing?

01:10:31.357 --> 01:10:36.884
I'’m simply asking the
Princess of Brooklyn a question.

01:10:36.928 --> 01:10:39.583
Are you talented, dear?

01:10:41.498 --> 01:10:44.762
I do trust your son'’s judgment
in that department,

01:10:44.805 --> 01:10:45.893
Your Majesty.

01:10:45.937 --> 01:10:47.591
That makes one of us.

01:10:47.634 --> 01:10:48.766
Mother.

01:10:48.809 --> 01:10:50.376
You have entrusted

01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:54.685
the most important event
of the year to this woman.

01:10:54.728 --> 01:10:57.078
Don'’t you think
it'’s my right

01:10:57.122 --> 01:10:59.690
to find out as much as I can
about her?

01:10:59.733 --> 01:11:01.779
Are you sure this is
about the event?

01:11:01.822 --> 01:11:04.477
Why? Should it be about
something else?

01:11:04.521 --> 01:11:05.739
You'’re incredible.

01:11:05.783 --> 01:11:07.263
Why, thank you.

01:11:12.529 --> 01:11:14.444
May I speak, Your Highness?

01:11:14.487 --> 01:11:16.315
It'’s a free country.

01:11:16.359 --> 01:11:18.186
It is a free country, isn'’t it?

01:11:18.230 --> 01:11:20.624
Yes.

01:11:20.667 --> 01:11:23.104
I realize you don'’t think that
I'’m good enough for your son,

01:11:23.148 --> 01:11:24.584
and I don'’t know,
maybe I'’m not.

01:11:24.628 --> 01:11:28.414
But the truth is,
Jack is a wonderful person

01:11:28.458 --> 01:11:32.113
with a good heart
and a humble soul.

01:11:32.157 --> 01:11:35.378
Our time last week has been
nothing short of amazing,

01:11:35.421 --> 01:11:39.425
and I want you to know I will
always cherish those memories.

01:11:39.469 --> 01:11:40.644
Jessica--

01:11:40.687 --> 01:11:42.385
Please take care of him.

01:11:42.428 --> 01:11:44.822
He deserves the absolute best,

01:11:44.865 --> 01:11:48.216
and I'’m sure you can
provide that for him.

01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:50.088
Eliza is not part of my life.

01:11:50.131 --> 01:11:51.132
Neither am I.

01:11:54.658 --> 01:11:57.835
- Please sit, son.
- I am ashamed.

01:11:57.878 --> 01:12:01.621
I can'’t believe you'd behave
in such an uncivilized manner.

01:12:01.665 --> 01:12:03.667
I'’m actually lost for words.

01:12:04.711 --> 01:12:05.625
Jessica!

01:12:17.594 --> 01:12:18.551
Jessica, wait.

01:12:19.770 --> 01:12:21.989
Don'’t. Just... just don't.

01:12:22.033 --> 01:12:24.470
That'’s what she does.
That'’s what she always does.

01:12:24.514 --> 01:12:27.038
But she'’s right. I'm not good
enough for you. I'’m a joke.

01:12:27.081 --> 01:12:30.476
You'’re no joke. Can't you see
what they'’re trying to do?

01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:33.653
You know, I thought for a
moment,

01:12:33.697 --> 01:12:36.047
just a moment,
that maybe you and me had--

01:12:36.090 --> 01:12:38.354
There was something between us

01:12:38.397 --> 01:12:41.444
that maybe we weren'’t ready
to admit to, but...

01:12:41.487 --> 01:12:43.489
I can see now
that I was being stupid.

01:12:43.533 --> 01:12:46.318
That'’s not true.

01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:48.451
No one knows how I feel but me.

01:12:48.494 --> 01:12:49.582
You'’re a prince.

01:12:49.626 --> 01:12:51.149
I run a diner in Brooklyn,

01:12:51.192 --> 01:12:53.281
and I'’m having trouble
doing that.

01:12:53.325 --> 01:12:55.632
I should have just listened
to myself in the beginning.

01:12:55.675 --> 01:12:57.416
I don'’t belong here,
and I never did.

01:12:57.460 --> 01:12:58.896
Jessica, please.

01:12:58.939 --> 01:13:00.506
Don'’t worry, Your Highness.

01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:03.248
I will not walk out
on the job.

01:13:03.291 --> 01:13:05.946
We made a deal,
and it was bought and paid for.

01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:09.559
I will see to it that Hailee and
Ernie give you their very best.

01:13:09.602 --> 01:13:11.125
Jessica, please don'’t
talk like that.

01:13:11.169 --> 01:13:16.174
I realize that this was all
just a business.

01:13:16.217 --> 01:13:20.787
I just didn'’t realize that it
was such a cutthroat business.

01:13:23.268 --> 01:13:25.096

I spent the night
in a coffee shop.

Well, after you left,

01:15:39.317 --> 01:15:40.710
I gave everyone
a piece of my mind

01:15:40.753 --> 01:15:42.233
and walked out
with your parents.

01:15:42.276 --> 01:15:43.887

pitch in to do what we could.

Well, um, you did all this?

Well, I felt the true attraction
of your Christmas Eve banquet

01:19:04.043 --> 01:19:06.654
is Christmas itself.

All of the fine traditional
comfort foods we grew up loving.

01:19:11.616 --> 01:19:13.357
It was all her idea.

I haven'’t had one of these
since I was 10 years old.

And we love it,
don'’t we, dear?

very merry.

some ideas of my own

in decorating the palace for
a more traditional Christmas.

01:19:32.506 --> 01:19:33.725
Oh.

01:19:33.769 --> 01:19:36.119
Yes, I'’m thinking
Christmas trees,

01:19:36.162 --> 01:19:38.556
some wreaths, bows.

01:19:38.599 --> 01:19:40.645

It'’s turkey
with stuffing crostini.

Not bad.

Please be seated

Thank you, everybody,
for coming.

This is our fifth anniversary
of this banquet,

01:20:48.365 --> 01:20:50.323
but as you may have noticed,

01:20:50.367 --> 01:20:55.502
this year we decided to do
something a little different.

01:20:55.546 --> 01:20:58.375
And that'’s all thanks
to one extraordinary woman,

01:20:58.418 --> 01:21:02.074
who contributed some
pretty extraordinary ideas.

01:21:02.118 --> 01:21:04.337
As you might have read,

01:21:04.381 --> 01:21:07.688
I recently went
on a small road trip

01:21:07.732 --> 01:21:10.778
to a wonderful little town
called Merryvale.

01:21:10.822 --> 01:21:12.519
And while I was there,

01:21:12.563 --> 01:21:15.174
I happened to meet
a particular young man,

01:21:15.218 --> 01:21:17.089
who told me his father
was serving overseas

01:21:17.133 --> 01:21:18.786
during this holiday.

01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:24.096
So I thought I'’d invite
a few special guests of my own.

01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:26.794
Unable to have a proper
Christmas dinner of their own,

01:21:26.838 --> 01:21:29.014
I would like them
to share in ours.

01:21:29.058 --> 01:21:32.539
Please welcome Tommy Carter and
his lovely mother, Jacqueline.

to formally introduce you

someone special.

I just had no idea how special

01:22:47.701 --> 01:22:50.878
or how much she would
make an impression

01:22:50.922 --> 01:22:54.012
not only on these banquets,

01:22:54.056 --> 01:22:56.449

I can'’t believe
you'’re actually eating that.

01:23:41.364 --> 01:23:45.150
Oh it'’s adequate,
if you like this sort of thing.

01:23:45.194 --> 01:23:47.457
I mean, I would'’ve whipped it up
if they'’d asked me.

01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:49.024
Are you serious?

01:23:49.067 --> 01:23:50.112
Try one.

01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:10.523
You'’ve changed the way
I look at things forever.

01:24:10.567 --> 01:24:12.699
Thank you, Jack.

01:24:12.743 --> 01:24:15.789
I mean... Your Highness.

01:24:15.833 --> 01:24:19.489
If I could have it my way,
I would cook for you every day.

01:24:19.532 --> 01:24:23.362
Well, you can,
if you really wanted to.

01:24:23.406 --> 01:24:27.801
But first, you'’ll--
you'’ll have to forgive me.

01:24:27.845 --> 01:24:31.718
Can you... forgive me?

01:24:31.762 --> 01:24:33.764
I'’ve been an absolute fool.

01:24:33.807 --> 01:24:36.593
Hmm. Forgive you.

01:24:41.815 --> 01:24:45.950
Well, since you asked
so nicely...

01:24:50.781 --> 01:24:56.047
[applause]

01:25:04.534 --> 01:25:05.709
Merry Christmas.

01:25:05.752 --> 01:25:07.276
Merry Christmas.
