00:18.435 --> 00:19.853
You're trending on Twitter.

00:22.439 --> 00:23.857
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

00:25.525 --> 00:28.403
I think I was preparing
for a mixed reaction,

00:28.486 --> 00:31.990
and the negative reactions
were a little bit louder.

00:34.034 --> 00:38.872
"Reminder, Colton being gay doesn't excuse
his abusive behavior towards Cassie."

00:40.623 --> 00:43.168
"You are trash,
garbage, a fucking player."

00:44.878 --> 00:48.965
You know, as happy as I was to come out
and have a lot of people there for me

00:49.049 --> 00:50.467
and in my corner,

00:50.550 --> 00:52.469
it goes away pretty quickly

00:52.552 --> 00:54.721
when you start reading
some of the comments.

00:56.139 --> 00:59.142
I'm not gonna lie,
I was not expecting, like, this.

00:59.225 --> 01:01.311
Why don't we just get in the car and go?

01:01.895 --> 01:03.646
Yeah.
Let's get in the car and leave.

01:10.153 --> 01:10.987
Ready?

01:17.160 --> 01:18.620
-What's up, man?
-How are you?

01:18.703 --> 01:19.954
-Good.
-Good morning.

01:20.038 --> 01:20.872
Yeah, that one.

01:25.668 --> 01:26.920
Holy shit.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.006
There's a lot of articles out right now.

01:31.633 --> 01:37.847
The headlines and social media
starts calling me out for being a stalker,

01:37.931 --> 01:39.099
being an abuser,

01:39.182 --> 01:42.602
and asking why
I haven't addressed those allegations.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.438
I think it's taken on even a bigger life

01:45.522 --> 01:48.149
than you thought it was going to,
isn't it?

01:50.401 --> 01:55.240
There's only so much that I can do
in regards to… the "Cassie" of it all.

01:56.449 --> 01:58.618
Legally, I can't talk about it.

01:58.701 --> 02:01.704
And the only person
that I have to blame is myself.

02:08.628 --> 02:09.712
Ready?

02:09.796 --> 02:11.297
-Yep.
-Just a second.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.447
-Hey.
-How are you?

02:36.531 --> 02:39.325
-Good. It's good to see you again.
-Good to see you.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.870
I'm feeling
pretty down this week.

02:41.953 --> 02:45.039
But after talking to my friends
from my new church, MCC,

02:45.123 --> 02:48.126
they have found somebody
that they want me to talk to,

02:48.209 --> 02:50.837
because I'm spiraling a little bit.

02:50.920 --> 02:54.465
And I really wanted you to meet my
colleague and friend, Nicole Garcia.

02:54.549 --> 02:57.552
-Okay.
-She's an amazing part of our community.

02:57.635 --> 02:58.970
Uh, she's transgender.

02:59.053 --> 03:03.433
And I hope that this is an opportunity
for you to hear another perspective.

03:03.516 --> 03:04.517
-Yeah.
-So…

03:04.601 --> 03:05.435
All right.

03:08.104 --> 03:09.230
There you go.

03:09.731 --> 03:12.609
-Hello, Nicole.
-Hello. How are you, Ben?

03:12.692 --> 03:15.028
-Been a while.
-It has been.

03:16.196 --> 03:19.574
-Oh, greetings, my friend.
-Peace to you. This is my friend Colton.

03:19.657 --> 03:21.117
-How are you?
-Hello, Colton.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.827
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

03:22.911 --> 03:26.789
It's such a pleasure to have you here.
Let's sit down and have a chit-chat.

03:26.873 --> 03:27.832
Cool.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.210
Any place of--
In a pew, if you want.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.962
And here is my… my friend Lucky.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.255
Oh, hi, Lucky.

03:34.964 --> 03:37.592
-I like dogs.
-Lucky hangs with me these days.

03:37.675 --> 03:38.801
Yes.

03:38.885 --> 03:39.719
Very cute.

03:40.386 --> 03:42.889
I've learned more through my dogs
than through humans.

03:42.972 --> 03:45.767
-What kind of dogs you have?
-I have a German shepherd.

03:45.850 --> 03:48.353
And I adopted Zuka
right after the breakup.

03:48.436 --> 03:49.938
-Mmm.
-Yeah.

03:51.606 --> 03:53.900
-So she saved my life.
-Yeah.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.277
How can I help?

03:57.779 --> 03:59.030
Um…

03:59.614 --> 04:03.868
My last relationship was with someone
who I met on The Bachelor, Cassie.

04:04.369 --> 04:09.207
And I held onto that relationship
out of fear of being a gay man,

04:09.290 --> 04:11.334
not out of anything other than that.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.753
And I did things that were messed up.

04:13.836 --> 04:14.963
I was paranoid.

04:15.046 --> 04:18.091
I was… scared.

04:18.174 --> 04:21.636
I was… terrified of myself,

04:21.719 --> 04:23.972
I was terrified of who I was gonna become.

04:24.514 --> 04:25.598
Mm-hmm.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.812
I was… literally,
I can say, like, mentally unstable.

04:31.729 --> 04:34.357
I undid so many good memories.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.109
I've texted the things that I texted

04:36.192 --> 04:38.528
and said the things that I said
out of insecurities,

04:38.611 --> 04:42.824
and that was me controlling the narrative
and trying to stay in control of my life.

04:43.658 --> 04:45.493
It's good to hear you say that,

04:46.119 --> 04:49.038
that you wanted and knew
you had to control the narrative,

04:49.122 --> 04:51.749
when the narrative
was spinning out of control.

04:53.042 --> 04:55.044
That's when you get desperate, isn't it?

04:55.795 --> 04:56.629
Yeah.

04:57.255 --> 04:58.256
Yeah.

05:00.883 --> 05:03.553
I see that in your eyes.
It almost killed you.

05:06.556 --> 05:07.932
After coming out,

05:08.016 --> 05:13.438
I have to relive all those labels
of "abuser, stalker, harasser."

05:14.772 --> 05:16.190
I'm mortified of what I did,

05:16.274 --> 05:19.027
but I'm even more mortified
on the effect that it had on her

05:19.110 --> 05:21.237
and her family and her friends, and…

05:21.988 --> 05:24.365
That's just got to weigh heavily on you.

05:24.866 --> 05:25.700
So…

05:25.783 --> 05:29.662
The headlines of "abuser" and "stalker,"
I catch myself going to the defense.

05:29.746 --> 05:33.082
I catch myself leaning into an excuse,

05:33.166 --> 05:36.419
or I'm catching myself
of, like, trying to control it again.

05:36.502 --> 05:39.047
It's like a vicious cycle
I'm going through right now

05:40.465 --> 05:42.008
of trying to give up control.

05:42.842 --> 05:45.219
Yet, there's a part of me
that won't let it go

05:45.303 --> 05:47.805
because it's like,
"You can't afford to screw up again."

05:49.098 --> 05:52.018
You'd like to control the situation,

05:53.061 --> 05:54.562
control the narrative.

05:54.645 --> 05:55.480
Yeah.

05:55.563 --> 05:58.024
Yeah. Takes a lot of energy, doesn't it?

05:58.649 --> 06:00.026
It's exhausting.

06:00.109 --> 06:02.612
Yeah.
And it takes a lot of manipulation.

06:04.197 --> 06:07.492
-And a lot of lies.
-Mm-hmm.

06:07.575 --> 06:10.036
And causes a lot of pain.

06:11.204 --> 06:15.708
And I put a poor girl through hell
of my own insecurities, and…

06:19.087 --> 06:21.339
all I can do is say sorry and, I mean…

06:23.424 --> 06:26.469
You want to sit down and apologize
to make yourself feel better?

06:27.470 --> 06:29.222
That's not the way to approach it.

06:29.305 --> 06:30.264
It takes…

06:31.599 --> 06:34.727
honesty and truth and vulnerability

06:34.811 --> 06:38.606
and looking in the mirror and saying,
"You know, I was a piece of shit."

06:40.817 --> 06:43.403
"I wanted things my way so bad

06:43.486 --> 06:46.614
I was willing to do anything
to make it happen."

06:49.242 --> 06:52.787
I was married for eight years,
and I lied for eight years,

06:52.870 --> 06:54.956
and we got divorced because, um,

06:55.039 --> 06:58.668
I was a drunk and angry man.

06:58.751 --> 06:59.585
Yeah.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.421
I still don't know after 20 years,

07:01.504 --> 07:03.923
don't know how
I could ever make it up to my ex.

07:04.424 --> 07:07.927
It's something that might
just burn in your soul forever.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.932
Um, and that's… It makes me feel guilty.

07:13.641 --> 07:15.768
Every morning,
I have to look in the mirror

07:15.852 --> 07:19.522
and own everything I did
and everything I said.

07:21.482 --> 07:26.904
And how can I be a better person today
and look outside of myself?

07:29.490 --> 07:32.618
-How did you forgive yourself?
-A lot of therapy.

07:33.911 --> 07:36.289
And it takes, for me, a lot of prayer.

07:36.372 --> 07:38.833
-Yeah.
-You're going to have to face it.

07:38.916 --> 07:42.795
Face your fears head-on
and know you're capable of that.

07:45.381 --> 07:47.341
Do you want to be like that again?

07:47.425 --> 07:48.259
No.

07:48.342 --> 07:49.177
No.

07:49.927 --> 07:51.095
Then do the work.

07:53.139 --> 07:56.100
Do the work in therapy,
do the work with your friends,

07:56.184 --> 07:58.895
and find out who the hell you are.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.231
Not a character that you portray.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.567
Not somebody that you're trying to be.

08:05.318 --> 08:10.031
You have been on The Bachelor,
but that doesn't identify who you are.

08:10.114 --> 08:13.743
And I really hope and pray
that you do find,

08:13.826 --> 08:17.413
at the right time,
when you're ready, a healthy relationship.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.873
I don't think you have a clue

08:18.956 --> 08:20.958
what it means
to be in a healthy relationship

08:21.042 --> 08:23.294
'cause you've never been
in a relationship as you.

08:24.921 --> 08:28.716
You've always been in a relationship
as somebody you're supposed to be.

08:29.217 --> 08:30.426
Who are you?

08:31.010 --> 08:34.514
The best thing you can do is work on you
and face up to what you've done

08:34.597 --> 08:37.016
before you get into
your next relationship,

08:37.099 --> 08:39.143
before you go fuck up
somebody else's life.

08:40.186 --> 08:42.480
Take responsibility for what you've done,

08:42.563 --> 08:45.525
and then work on not doing it again.

08:48.152 --> 08:49.654
Who are you called to be?

08:51.781 --> 08:53.241
What's in your heart?

09:23.854 --> 09:24.981
What's up? Oh.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.024
How are you?

09:27.108 --> 09:28.484
-How are you?
-Good to see you.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.402
Good to see you.

09:29.485 --> 09:30.319
I love the rings.

09:30.403 --> 09:33.864
Joseph and Eddie are friends of mine.
They're also friends with Cassie.

09:33.948 --> 09:37.159
They were in our friend group,
and they were in the middle of all this

09:37.243 --> 09:38.369
when it was going down.

09:38.452 --> 09:43.165
And I think it's important for me
to sit down and let them ask questions,

09:43.249 --> 09:46.669
let them understand
why I might have lied or deceived them,

09:47.670 --> 09:48.671
and just catch up.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.090
Well, first and foremost,

09:52.341 --> 09:54.302
I want to say sorry
to you guys.

09:56.053 --> 09:59.223
Uh… Yeah, I went through a lot
this last year,

09:59.307 --> 10:02.351
but I could have handled
the situations in LA a lot different.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.104
I should have told you
I was going on Good Morning America,

10:05.187 --> 10:06.606
coming out, and I should have--

10:06.689 --> 10:07.815
It would've been nice.

10:08.482 --> 10:12.528
I'm like… I feel like I'm always
in this hard position with this situation.

10:12.612 --> 10:16.449
I a hundred and ten percent
understand your point of view,

10:16.532 --> 10:18.492
and then I understand Cassie,

10:18.576 --> 10:23.289
but being gay is not okay
for what happened, at the end of the day.

10:23.372 --> 10:24.582
You know what I mean?

10:25.082 --> 10:26.876
I'm going to tell you straight up,

10:27.835 --> 10:30.087
what you fucking put her through
was bullshit.

10:30.671 --> 10:34.258
You fucked up,
and there is no excuse, whatsoever,

10:35.217 --> 10:36.886
for everything that you did.

10:36.969 --> 10:40.556
Scared her and put her
in a situation where it was just not…

10:41.182 --> 10:42.642
It wasn't comfortable for her.

10:42.725 --> 10:45.144
Yes, you are a gay man,

10:45.227 --> 10:47.563
which has been
a part of your life journey.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.190
But at the end of the day,

10:49.273 --> 10:53.235
it is no excuse for everything
that you've put her through.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.236
Yeah.

10:55.446 --> 10:56.947
I'm not a perfect person.

10:57.031 --> 10:59.617
I definitely fucked up
on the way of coming out,

10:59.700 --> 11:02.536
and it was not the best situation for me.

11:02.620 --> 11:05.456
I think that's why I was able
to look at you and just be like…

11:05.539 --> 11:09.001
I could see a lot of what I did
with what you did.

11:09.085 --> 11:12.171
Everyone has their own time
and their own stories.

11:12.254 --> 11:14.423
I know I was confused
for a very long time.

11:14.507 --> 11:18.594
Like, I had a girlfriend three years
before I actually came out,

11:18.678 --> 11:19.887
a full-blown relationship.

11:19.970 --> 11:22.431
I know it's not easy,
especially with your upbringing

11:22.515 --> 11:25.935
and being very… You know, like,
religious values and everything.

11:26.018 --> 11:27.937
I get it, it's hard.

11:28.813 --> 11:29.814
Unfortunately,

11:29.897 --> 11:32.900
it's just about all the damage you do
on the way of coming out.

11:33.484 --> 11:36.904
I think hearing Joseph say
coming out is hard…

11:37.905 --> 11:39.448
We have so many similarities,

11:39.532 --> 11:43.202
but I think while I'm, like, on this path
of figuring out who I am…

11:43.285 --> 11:47.206
I've been working so hard
to move on and move forward,

11:47.289 --> 11:49.083
but I do have a past,

11:49.166 --> 11:53.587
and I did hurt people in my past,
and it's not going to just go away.

11:53.671 --> 11:59.343
It's really up to everyone what they're
going to choose to be uncomfortable with.

12:00.177 --> 12:04.014
And it's a very big, hard thing
that you're kind of asking people to do.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.601
Unfortunately, it's just part of life,
you grow with people,

12:07.685 --> 12:09.437
and you grow sometimes without people.

12:09.520 --> 12:12.398
The best thing you can do is try to be
a good person from this point on

12:12.481 --> 12:14.734
and just be, like,
honest with who you are.

12:16.068 --> 12:16.902
Yeah.

12:18.028 --> 12:19.029
I agree.

12:34.545 --> 12:36.714
-What's up?
-How are you? Good to see you.

12:36.797 --> 12:39.091
-Good to see you. Nice to meet you.
-Come on in.

12:40.760 --> 12:44.054
-Hey, Colton. Hi, man. How are you?
-This is for you.

12:44.138 --> 12:45.473
While I'm in LA,

12:45.556 --> 12:48.559
I'm going to have
some conversations with some people

12:48.642 --> 12:51.437
who have gone through
similar situations as me.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.731
I'm glad that we got connected and--

12:53.814 --> 12:56.609
-Believe me, I heard all about you.
-You did?

12:56.692 --> 12:58.319
-Yeah.

12:58.402 --> 13:02.031
One of my good friends
is really close with Fran.

13:02.114 --> 13:04.492
Fran and Peter were married for 20 years,

13:04.575 --> 13:06.619
and then they got a divorce.

13:06.702 --> 13:10.164
And after their divorce,
Peter came out of the closet as gay.

13:10.915 --> 13:14.710
I always knew in the back of my head
that I was attracted to guys,

13:14.794 --> 13:16.086
but it wasn't an option.

13:16.170 --> 13:17.838
It was just like, "Okay, well…"

13:17.922 --> 13:20.925
But I was also attracted to her,
so I figured that's the way…

13:21.008 --> 13:22.551
-Yeah.
-…guys are supposed to go.

13:22.635 --> 13:26.388
When I grew up,
there was no real thing, "gay."

13:26.472 --> 13:29.308
I didn't… I grew up in Queens,
in Flushing, and I--

13:29.391 --> 13:32.478
You got married at 21 years old,
and we did.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.522
We had a life.

13:34.605 --> 13:35.981
You know, we had friends,

13:36.065 --> 13:37.358
we had a beautiful home.

13:37.441 --> 13:40.653
And we didn't have a problem
in, you know, having the sex either.

13:40.736 --> 13:42.613
It wasn't like we weren't having sex
or anything.

13:42.696 --> 13:46.826
We had a lot of sex,
but the rest of it, I just buried down.

13:46.909 --> 13:49.495
When I did that,
I became very controlling.

13:50.079 --> 13:53.541
It's like, I couldn't control myself,
I guess, so I controlled her.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.585
And that got very, uh, intense,

13:56.669 --> 13:59.171
and she didn't like that,
and I don't blame her,

13:59.755 --> 14:02.174
and, uh, eventually
it destroyed the marriage.

14:02.758 --> 14:04.969
We would be out with another couple,

14:05.052 --> 14:08.222
and he would constantly
be monitoring what I'm saying.

14:08.305 --> 14:09.974
I was feeling suffocated.

14:10.057 --> 14:12.309
I knew he didn't want
the relationship to end,

14:12.393 --> 14:15.479
but I knew that I needed a break.

14:16.063 --> 14:18.524
And he really needed to look at himself

14:18.607 --> 14:22.903
because he was very reactive
and easily triggered.

14:22.987 --> 14:25.614
He couldn't accept
that I wanted out of the relationship,

14:25.698 --> 14:27.074
and he knew he was gay.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.578
And it made it very hard on me, very hard.

14:31.453 --> 14:35.332
And it turned out to be, actually,
although very painful at the time,

14:35.833 --> 14:37.543
the best thing we could have done,

14:37.626 --> 14:42.214
because it forced him
to really face his true orientation.

14:43.173 --> 14:45.926
Did you hold any resentment towards him

14:46.010 --> 14:50.598
for… spending, what,
was it 20 years together…

14:50.681 --> 14:52.933
-Twenty-one years.
-No.

14:53.017 --> 14:57.479
I had felt so guilty for leaving him
that I was glad that he…

14:57.563 --> 15:00.107
Something good for him came out of it.

15:00.190 --> 15:02.818
Everybody has a right
to live an authentic life,

15:02.902 --> 15:05.362
and I can appreciate his struggle

15:05.905 --> 15:07.948
and feel compassion for him.

15:08.490 --> 15:12.912
Listen, it takes a big person
to allow someone else,

15:13.704 --> 15:16.707
uh, the room
that you took and needed to take.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.125
Yeah.

15:18.208 --> 15:20.085
Some people come into your life

15:20.169 --> 15:23.172
for a season, for a reason,
or for a lifetime.

15:23.797 --> 15:29.136
And you may never put your relationship
with this woman on a different shelf.

15:29.219 --> 15:31.263
And you know what? That's life too.

15:31.347 --> 15:32.181
But I think…

15:32.264 --> 15:34.224
That's why it's nice
to sit with you, Peter,

15:34.308 --> 15:36.894
'cause there's a big part of me
that still carries guilt

15:36.977 --> 15:41.357
for, you know,
wasting some of my ex's time.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.817
I think a lot of people,
especially in the public,

15:43.901 --> 15:47.613
are frustrated that I went on a show
when I had no business going on a show.

15:47.696 --> 15:49.114
And I can sit here and be like,

15:49.198 --> 15:51.825
I wouldn't be out
if it wasn't for that show.

15:51.909 --> 15:54.453
You were doing
what you thought was right then,

15:54.536 --> 15:56.288
and you wouldn't do it today.

15:56.372 --> 15:59.458
It's really great
that you actually did confront all this,

15:59.541 --> 16:01.543
'cause when I came out I was close to 40.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.880
Obviously, this all happened for a reason.

16:04.964 --> 16:08.759
Otherwise, you might have kept repeating
that same cycle over and over.

16:08.842 --> 16:10.803
You really got to live your own life,

16:10.886 --> 16:14.223
and… and it took me
a long time to figure it out.

16:14.306 --> 16:16.642
-I could have been married by now.
-That's right.

16:17.476 --> 16:18.352
Had kids.

16:18.435 --> 16:20.938
Had kids and started a family,
and then 10-20 years--

16:21.021 --> 16:24.108
You go further and further
down the wrong road.

16:24.191 --> 16:27.903
-Yeah.
-That much further away from your true…

16:28.946 --> 16:34.702
It's never, ever, ever the right choice
to, uh, live a double life.

16:36.787 --> 16:38.372
What's cool about spending time

16:38.455 --> 16:40.916
with Fran and Peter
is they have a healthy friendship.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.876
I can only hope that eventually, one day,

16:42.960 --> 16:47.715
I can have, you know,
that type of friendship or camaraderie

16:47.798 --> 16:50.092
with some of the women that I've dated.

16:50.175 --> 16:52.428
Well, thank you two for helping me.

16:52.511 --> 16:55.222
-You're so welcome.
-Any time. Any time.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.985
-Door's open.
-How've you been?

17:08.068 --> 17:09.653
-I've been good. How are you?
-Good.

17:09.737 --> 17:11.864
-You look great.
-Thanks. You too.

17:13.198 --> 17:16.827
Onyeka was one of the 30 girls
that was on my season of The Bachelor.

17:16.910 --> 17:20.456
After my interview,
I remember seeing her tweet.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.833
She was one of the first women
to reach out,

17:22.916 --> 17:24.668
and it meant a lot to me.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.713
I can only assume
that Onyeka has a lot of questions,

17:27.796 --> 17:32.926
and I hope that I can give her the truth
and the answers that she's looking for.

17:33.010 --> 17:35.721
First of all,
how are you feeling about everything?

17:35.804 --> 17:39.600
So I was nervous to talk to you
or other women that were on my season

17:39.683 --> 17:42.686
'cause I don't want
you guys to feel… duped

17:42.770 --> 17:45.939
or… betrayed or like I wasted your time.

17:47.649 --> 17:50.861
I guess, in reality,
I had no business being the Bachelor.

17:50.944 --> 17:53.072
I just, mentally, was not in a good place.

17:53.155 --> 17:56.116
I remember saying, "Thank you, God,
for making me the Bachelor."

17:56.200 --> 17:58.368
"You're gonna answer my prayer
in making me straight."

17:58.452 --> 18:02.956
"This is my chance to find a wife,
and… and now I have nowhere to run."

18:04.416 --> 18:05.793
So I have to get engaged.

18:05.876 --> 18:07.711
Then, once I get engaged,
I'm gonna get married,

18:07.795 --> 18:09.463
and once I get married,
I'm gonna have kids,

18:09.546 --> 18:11.381
and then it's gonna make me straighter,

18:11.465 --> 18:15.677
which, in looking back, is super silly,
and I wouldn't want that now,

18:15.761 --> 18:19.681
but… that was
sort of like my process in it.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.016
-Yeah.
-It just…

18:21.100 --> 18:24.478
It was like…
like this house of cards that I built,

18:24.561 --> 18:26.814
and when it crashed,
it crashed hard, and that was me.

18:26.897 --> 18:29.900
And I just got to a really,
really, really bad place.

18:29.983 --> 18:33.987
But, like,
I'm more true to myself than ever.

18:34.071 --> 18:38.117
Did you have any idea,
or was there any signs for you?

18:38.200 --> 18:39.201
I mean…

18:40.160 --> 18:43.038
I did sense some sort of wall.

18:43.747 --> 18:48.043
Like a wall there that I had with you
that I didn't have with other men ever.

18:48.961 --> 18:52.339
I remember with Onyeka there was
this time that we were in Thailand,

18:52.422 --> 18:54.133
and we were sitting down,

18:54.216 --> 18:57.761
talking about a confrontation
that she had with another Bachelorette.

18:57.845 --> 19:00.305
I kind of wanna just know
what your thoughts are

19:00.389 --> 19:02.057
and where you're at with everything.

19:02.141 --> 19:02.975
You know?

19:03.058 --> 19:03.892
Yeah.

19:04.768 --> 19:05.602
Um…

19:07.521 --> 19:09.857
People saw that as a lack of connection,

19:09.940 --> 19:12.985
and in reality,
it was me being intimidated

19:13.068 --> 19:14.361
because I was scared

19:14.444 --> 19:17.739
if we ended up together,
she would call me out on my shit.

19:18.323 --> 19:23.203
I think there… there was a part of me
who was more intimidated by you,

19:23.287 --> 19:25.539
that you would have
put me in a corner quicker.

19:25.622 --> 19:29.042
Yeah. I'd be like, "What's going on?
Something's off. Let's talk about this."

19:29.126 --> 19:30.961
And that's… I mean, that's who I am.

19:31.044 --> 19:33.463
That's hard for me to even say,
but it's the truth,

19:33.547 --> 19:37.593
is, like, I was more intimidated
versus someone else on the season

19:37.676 --> 19:40.470
because I think I felt comfort and safety

19:40.554 --> 19:43.307
with… women who are a little more reserved

19:43.390 --> 19:45.434
and unsure and shy because, like…

19:47.019 --> 19:49.897
That gives you room to essentially, like…

19:49.980 --> 19:51.231
-Hide.
-…hide.

19:51.315 --> 19:52.149
Yeah.

19:52.232 --> 19:54.318
-And--
-And I did. I did that well.

19:54.401 --> 19:56.403
See, that's crazy because, like, if…

19:57.237 --> 20:00.991
Let's say I had been
the one you picked at the end, like,

20:01.074 --> 20:04.995
after fantasy suites, I'd have been like,
"Something's off, let's talk about this."

20:05.078 --> 20:07.789
And I think that's why in The Bachelor,

20:07.873 --> 20:10.459
why the fantasy suites
were so intimidating and scary…

20:10.542 --> 20:12.336
-Terrifying.
-…and why I only did one.

20:12.419 --> 20:15.422
Yeah, that's so true,
you only did one fantasy suite.

20:15.505 --> 20:20.385
Fantasy suites in The Bachelor world
is an overnight date.

20:20.469 --> 20:23.388
And being labeled the "Virgin Bachelor,"

20:23.472 --> 20:25.349
everybody was so interested

20:25.432 --> 20:27.893
if I would lose my virginity on the show.

20:27.976 --> 20:30.562
And people saw my date with Tayshia,

20:30.646 --> 20:32.856
sitting there at dinner, nervous.

20:32.940 --> 20:35.943
What people saw
was, like, this blossoming relationship

20:36.026 --> 20:40.447
and what was about to be
a huge step for me and for us.

20:40.530 --> 20:41.406
But in reality,

20:41.490 --> 20:43.450
I didn't want to go
into the fantasy suite,

20:43.533 --> 20:45.452
I didn't want to put Tayshia through that.

20:45.535 --> 20:48.872
I knew I was attracted to men,
but I felt like,

20:48.956 --> 20:51.416
"If I lose my virginity
in the fantasy suite,

20:51.500 --> 20:55.295
is it going to please me enough
to keep me wanting to be straight?"

20:55.796 --> 20:56.755
Crossing that line,

20:56.838 --> 21:00.509
it was such a big deal because
it would force me one way or the other.

21:00.592 --> 21:03.095
And I didn't know
which way that was going to be.

21:03.637 --> 21:06.848
And I felt so bad even for Tayshia
because I remember that night,

21:06.932 --> 21:09.226
I slept in sweatpants and a sweatshirt.

21:09.309 --> 21:10.435
Oh my God!

21:10.519 --> 21:13.397
And it was 70 degrees in the thing,
I'm sweating, but I'm like,

21:13.480 --> 21:15.732
"I don't want
to give her the wrong impression."

21:15.816 --> 21:17.734
-Was she trying to--
-No.

21:17.818 --> 21:22.281
Tayshia was so respectful
and so nice and nurturing and great. Like…

21:22.364 --> 21:23.323
Yeah.

21:23.407 --> 21:27.035
-Totally very classy and awesome.
-Mm-hmm.

21:27.119 --> 21:30.330
I still built connections,
and I still genuinely cared

21:30.414 --> 21:33.041
-for everyone that I got to know.
-Yeah.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.460
Well, you're loved, you're accepted.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.921
I don't feel like I was led astray.

21:38.505 --> 21:42.259
If anything, I feel like I'm proud
that I was a part of your journey.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.803
You have such a genuine heart.

21:44.886 --> 21:49.182
I would never look back on that experience
and feel, like, any malicious intent

21:49.266 --> 21:53.437
because, obviously,
you were still figuring out who you are.

21:54.271 --> 21:59.318
I don't expect everybody
that I meet and come out to

21:59.401 --> 22:00.736
to understand exactly,

22:01.945 --> 22:04.281
you know, what I've been going through,

22:05.240 --> 22:08.660
but it's nice to sit here
and talk with Onyeka

22:08.744 --> 22:11.163
and feel like she's there for me.

22:11.246 --> 22:13.832
Not everyone's gonna understand,
that's okay,

22:13.915 --> 22:16.126
but, honestly, everyone I've talked to,

22:16.877 --> 22:19.963
no one's felt like, "He played us!"

22:20.047 --> 22:24.676
As I take the time to talk to people
who I have hurt, sort of, along the way,

22:24.760 --> 22:29.056
I have a new way of looking at my past.

22:29.139 --> 22:33.810
Just because I came out and just because
I now have internal freedom and happiness,

22:34.394 --> 22:36.980
that doesn't erase my past
and what I've been through.

22:37.064 --> 22:39.566
For me, it gives me
the perspective of saying like,

22:39.649 --> 22:41.735
"Okay, this is going to be
an everyday effort."

22:41.818 --> 22:44.321
I've been seeing a therapist
for a while now,

22:44.404 --> 22:47.699
and I think it's really important
to continue having these conversations.

22:47.783 --> 22:51.286
I'm going to go out of my way every day
to try to become a better person

22:51.370 --> 22:55.832
and, you know,
just learn from some of my mistakes.

22:55.916 --> 22:57.834
I'm so impressed.
I'm so excited for you.

22:57.918 --> 23:00.170
Thank you. I'm very, very excited too.

23:00.253 --> 23:03.757
Your path is completely different
from anyone that has ever come out.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.425
You dated 30 girls on TV!

23:05.509 --> 23:09.471
That's not a normal
coming-out story for people, you know,

23:09.554 --> 23:12.599
but from my perspective as an ex,

23:12.682 --> 23:13.517
I support you.

23:13.600 --> 23:16.395
You are going to
absolutely thrive in this world.

23:16.478 --> 23:18.271
You're going to meet a hot-ass man.

23:18.355 --> 23:19.481
Ah! Bring it in!

23:19.564 --> 23:21.691
You're the best! I'm so excited for you.

23:21.775 --> 23:23.151
-Thank you.
-Of course.

23:41.211 --> 23:43.839
-Do you have wine of some sort?
-Yes, I have wine.

23:43.922 --> 23:45.590
-It's my mama.

23:46.466 --> 23:47.926
-Hey.
-Hey.

23:48.009 --> 23:49.261
Kassidy's here.

23:49.344 --> 23:50.846
-Hi. How are you?
-Hi, Donna.

23:50.929 --> 23:52.222
Nice to see you.

23:52.305 --> 23:54.349
-Nice to see you. Donna.
-Hi. I'm Gus.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.017
-This is my mom.
-Nice to meet you.

23:56.101 --> 23:57.352
-Nice to meet you.
-Daniel.

23:57.436 --> 24:00.313
I'm realizing as heavy
as these last few weeks have been,

24:00.397 --> 24:02.357
I have experienced a sense of relief.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.943
And I haven't had time
to really celebrate that,

24:05.026 --> 24:08.405
and this is sort of round two,
"Redemption Time from Nashville."

24:08.488 --> 24:11.283
This is a true coming-out party
right here.

24:11.867 --> 24:13.368
There's a lot of people coming,

24:13.452 --> 24:15.412
and I'm excited for you
to meet some people

24:15.495 --> 24:17.456
who I've met along the way.

24:17.539 --> 24:19.416
-Like Gus.
-Like Gus.

24:19.499 --> 24:21.001
-First time meeting Gus?
-Yeah.

24:21.084 --> 24:22.669
What's your first impression?

24:23.170 --> 24:25.547
-I'm a little taller than him.
-You're wearing heels.

24:27.174 --> 24:28.175
But so am I.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.720
Cheers. Thank you guys for coming.

24:31.803 --> 24:32.637
Cheers.

24:32.721 --> 24:33.555
-Cheers.
-Congrats.

24:37.809 --> 24:39.769
-How are you?

24:41.062 --> 24:41.938
Look at you.

24:42.022 --> 24:43.690
-Thanks for coming out.
-Sure.

24:44.441 --> 24:45.734
Thank you for inviting me.

24:47.027 --> 24:49.529
Everybody has space
to learn and change and grow.

24:49.613 --> 24:50.989
That's so true.

24:51.072 --> 24:52.449
It's a very special night.

24:52.532 --> 24:55.702
My worlds are all colliding now.
I don't have to compartmentalize my life.

24:55.785 --> 24:57.621
They're all engaging, sharing stories.

24:57.704 --> 24:58.830
MCC's an amazing church.

24:58.914 --> 25:00.624
I have my NFL buddies here,

25:00.707 --> 25:04.044
some of my church friends here,
and I don't want to control this party.

25:04.127 --> 25:05.795
I don't have to control the room.

25:05.879 --> 25:07.506
Do you plan
on living in Colorado?

25:07.589 --> 25:08.423
This is it?

25:08.507 --> 25:11.176
For right now, I wanna live here,
I wanna be here, I'm happy here.

25:11.259 --> 25:13.720
And I, hopefully, can have kids one day.

25:13.803 --> 25:16.473
I always tell everyone
that Shelby is the best name.

25:16.556 --> 25:18.517
I need somebody
to name their kid after me.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.852
It's the least I owe you
after helping my career.

25:21.436 --> 25:22.479
-Oh my God.
-Good shit.

25:26.483 --> 25:28.235
Did you guys get anything to eat yet?

25:28.318 --> 25:29.819
-He's a vegetarian.
-I have not.

25:29.903 --> 25:32.697
-You're not a vegetarian in the bedroom?
-No.

25:34.032 --> 25:37.494
-Probably… He's trying… Listen.
-I'm trying.

25:37.577 --> 25:40.789
-He's trying his gay jokes. Support him.
-He's trying.

25:41.289 --> 25:42.958
Colton, that was really good!

25:43.041 --> 25:43.875
Colton!

25:44.751 --> 25:46.419
Get the balloons in… There we go.

25:50.090 --> 25:53.093
I just want to make a toast real quick
to everybody here.

25:53.176 --> 25:55.345
Thank you, all, for being here and coming.

25:55.428 --> 25:58.807
To the people who've come into my life
in the last few weeks,

25:58.890 --> 26:02.602
and to the people who have always been
in my life and have been in my corner,

26:03.186 --> 26:05.564
it's meant the world
to have your guys' support.

26:06.189 --> 26:10.068
I know that not everybody who comes out
has support like I have,

26:10.151 --> 26:11.486
-and…
-Amen to that.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.738
I wouldn't be able
to be standing here

26:14.614 --> 26:16.408
without you guys, so thank you.

26:17.450 --> 26:18.451
Love you.

26:19.869 --> 26:22.706
Coming out was some
of the hardest moments of my life,

26:22.789 --> 26:25.375
but I feel like I have
the right support system,

26:25.458 --> 26:27.669
and they'll be there
to pick me up if I fall.

26:28.169 --> 26:32.632
I just want to make a toast
to freedom and being who you are.

26:35.635 --> 26:37.095
So cheers.

26:37.178 --> 26:38.013
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

26:38.096 --> 26:39.848
-Definitely. Cheers.
-Cheers!

26:56.406 --> 26:58.700
I feel like
I've come such a long way

26:58.783 --> 27:00.660
since first coming out to my mom.

27:00.744 --> 27:03.955
But at the same time, there's so much
that I still have to learn.

27:04.456 --> 27:07.083
Everybody's coming-out stories
are different.

27:07.917 --> 27:12.464
With that being said, I'm trying to be
as open and transparent and vulnerable

27:12.547 --> 27:15.592
and share who I am as a human being
and how I got to this point.

27:16.176 --> 27:20.013
All I can do is share my story
and hope that it helps.

27:21.473 --> 27:28.021
I know that there are a lot
of untold stories in the LGBTQ+ community,

27:28.104 --> 27:32.025
and I'm grateful to be able
to add my story to the conversation

27:32.108 --> 27:36.363
to continue to push forward
until stories like this,

27:37.364 --> 27:39.157
you know, don't have to be told anymore.

27:41.284 --> 27:42.744
There's been people before me

27:42.827 --> 27:45.664
who have helped me
be able to sit in this chair right now

27:45.747 --> 27:49.584
and talk with you… on a national platform.

27:50.418 --> 27:52.253
And there's gonna be people after me

27:53.254 --> 27:55.131
that will continue to push

27:55.757 --> 27:58.843
and change people's hearts
and change people's minds.
