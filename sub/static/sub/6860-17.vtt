00:16.527 --> 00:17.894
Invasion!

00:17.928 --> 00:21.163
The planet Cato Neimoidia
is under Separatist attack.

00:21.198 --> 00:24.433
Anakin Skywalker
and his Padawan, Ashoka Tano,

00:24.468 --> 00:27.169
rush to the rescue as they lead
a squadron of starfighters

00:27.204 --> 00:29.505
to the planet below.

00:37.381 --> 00:39.850
Ahsoka, punch a hole
for the gunships to get through.

00:39.884 --> 00:41.752
I know the drill, Master.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:05.510 --> 01:07.145
Look out, incoming missiles.

01:09.915 --> 01:11.115
No problem.

01:14.252 --> 01:16.087
Uh...
slight problem.

01:18.823 --> 01:20.324
Ahsoka, I've got buzz droids.

01:20.358 --> 01:21.458
How bad did you get hit?

01:21.493 --> 01:22.826
I'm all clear.

01:22.861 --> 01:24.028
What?

01:24.062 --> 01:25.863
You always have it easy, Snips.

01:32.737 --> 01:35.305
Good job, Artoo.

01:35.339 --> 01:37.307
Someday these droids will learn
they keep messing

01:37.341 --> 01:38.775
with the wrong Jedi.

01:40.077 --> 01:41.477
Looks like you're clear.

01:41.512 --> 01:44.113
Just keep watching
and learning, Padawan.

01:45.882 --> 01:47.082
Uh-oh.

01:47.117 --> 01:48.250
You're trailing smoke.

01:48.284 --> 01:49.251
What's wrong?

01:49.285 --> 01:51.019
Oh, nothing serious.

01:51.053 --> 01:52.921
Just a small malfunction.

01:52.955 --> 01:55.190
Ugh!

01:57.027 --> 01:58.394
Master?

01:58.428 --> 01:59.762
Master, come in.

01:59.796 --> 02:01.664
Artoo, what's going on over there?

02:03.835 --> 02:05.169
Unconscious?

02:05.203 --> 02:06.370
Fly back to the cruiser.

02:07.539 --> 02:09.106
What do you mean there's something wrong

02:09.139 --> 02:10.207
with the engines?

02:10.241 --> 02:12.277
Tip your wing.
I'll see how bad it is.

02:16.415 --> 02:18.182
Oh, that's not good.

02:19.584 --> 02:22.185
Let's just say now would be
a good time to land.

02:24.789 --> 02:27.425
Artoo, can you land the ship
on that cliff ledge?

02:29.027 --> 02:32.062
I don't care if the landing zone
is too short.

02:32.096 --> 02:33.831
Get that ship on the ground.

02:35.333 --> 02:38.234
R7, take over the ship.

02:38.269 --> 02:40.203
I'm going after Anakin.

02:40.237 --> 02:42.305
Somebody has to save his skin.

03:21.209 --> 03:22.175
Artoo!

03:30.085 --> 03:33.020
Ugh, very funny, Artoo.

03:33.055 --> 03:35.489
Are you okay, Master?

03:35.524 --> 03:38.092
Yeah, what'd I miss?

03:38.126 --> 03:40.895
Oh, not much.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.529
Wait a minute.
Wasn't I flying?

03:42.564 --> 03:43.530
Where's my fighter?

03:43.565 --> 03:44.932
How did I get here?

03:44.966 --> 03:46.066
Fighter crashed.

03:46.101 --> 03:47.067
I saved the day.

03:47.102 --> 03:51.306
You're welcome.

03:51.340 --> 03:53.408
Huh, all right.

03:56.078 --> 03:58.846
Captain Rex,
Ahsoka and I need a little help.

03:58.881 --> 04:00.214
Right away, sir.

04:09.725 --> 04:10.959
Master Yoda.

04:10.993 --> 04:14.296
Return to the Jedi Temple
quickly, you should,

04:14.330 --> 04:15.530
you and your Padawan.

04:15.565 --> 04:18.233
We're kind of busy, Master Yoda.

04:18.267 --> 04:21.938
The reason we need you,
important it is, Skywalker.

04:21.971 --> 04:24.607
Bombed the Temple hangar, someone has.

04:24.642 --> 04:27.477
Your assistance to find
the terrorist, we need.

04:27.511 --> 04:30.480
Who could successfully bomb
the Jedi Temple?

04:30.515 --> 04:33.517
We'll be right there, Master.

04:44.095 --> 04:46.530
How could the Separatists
infiltrate the Temple?

04:46.564 --> 04:48.999
Worse than that it is.

04:49.033 --> 04:51.501
What could be worse, Master Yoda?

04:55.339 --> 04:57.607
Everything is on the table.

04:57.641 --> 04:59.209
We have to look at the possibility

04:59.243 --> 05:02.612
that it could've been anyone
in the Temple, even a Jedi.

05:02.647 --> 05:04.948
If a Jedi this is,

05:04.982 --> 05:08.084
gone to the dark side they have.

05:08.119 --> 05:10.887
I...
I can't believe a Jedi

05:10.922 --> 05:13.423
would attack a place this sacred.

05:13.458 --> 05:16.426
We'd like for you two to lead
the investigation.

05:16.461 --> 05:20.197
We can't trust anyone
who was here, even a Jedi.

05:20.231 --> 05:22.351
You and Ahsoka will provide
an impartial point of view

05:22.367 --> 05:23.534
free of assumptions.

05:23.568 --> 05:25.336
We'll do everything we can.

05:25.370 --> 05:28.372
Careful you must be, Skywalker.

05:28.406 --> 05:31.242
If willing to destroy the Temple
the attacker is,

05:31.276 --> 05:34.612
to great lengths they will go
to keep from being caught.

05:34.646 --> 05:36.981
Then I guess we'll have to go
to even greater lengths

05:37.016 --> 05:39.017
to catch him.

05:48.534 --> 05:50.398
I can still hear the screams.

05:50.607 --> 05:52.307
Do you believe what they said, Master,

05:52.342 --> 05:54.343
that a Jedi could do this?

05:54.377 --> 05:57.446
Not every Jedi agrees
with this war, Ahsoka.

05:57.481 --> 06:00.116
There are many
political idealists among us.

06:00.150 --> 06:01.751
But a traitor?

06:01.785 --> 06:05.187
I'm afraid one can eventually
become the other.

06:05.221 --> 06:08.024
Remember Count Dooku and General Krell.

06:08.058 --> 06:09.459
That's how they started too.

06:09.493 --> 06:11.594
Only analysis and investigation

06:11.628 --> 06:14.263
will prove what is true or not.

06:14.297 --> 06:15.598
Who are you?

06:15.632 --> 06:17.900
I am Russo-ISC,

06:17.934 --> 06:20.068
Crime Scene Analyzer for the Jedi.

06:20.103 --> 06:24.072
I will be working with you
and your Padawan on this case.

06:24.107 --> 06:27.642
I was assigned by Master Windu.

06:27.676 --> 06:29.177
Okay, Russo,

06:29.211 --> 06:31.046
you and Ahsoka should
begin the interviews.

06:31.080 --> 06:34.950
I would rather interview
the witnesses alone.

06:36.853 --> 06:37.953
Why?

06:37.987 --> 06:39.988
Many of the wounded have heard rumors

06:40.022 --> 06:42.123
a Jedi was behind this explosion.

06:42.158 --> 06:47.229
There will be ill will toward you.

06:47.263 --> 06:49.565
I think you're overexaggerating, Russo.

06:49.599 --> 06:50.999
There were Jedi killed in that blast

06:51.033 --> 06:53.468
along with maintenance crew and clones.

06:53.502 --> 06:55.003
Take Ahsoka with you.

06:55.037 --> 06:57.405
Let me know if you find anything.

06:57.440 --> 06:58.973
I will, Master.

07:10.588 --> 07:14.425
Did you notice anything unusual
about the hangar?

07:14.459 --> 07:16.226
Not really.

07:16.261 --> 07:18.629
Although, I left the
hangar five minutes before

07:18.663 --> 07:19.964
the bomb exploded.

07:19.998 --> 07:22.500
Did everything seem okay before that?

07:22.535 --> 07:25.903
Everything seemed normal.

07:25.938 --> 07:28.840
Is it true a Jedi might be
responsible for the attack?

07:30.076 --> 07:33.244
We're not certain of anything
at this point.

07:36.882 --> 07:38.616
This distrust is troubling.

07:38.650 --> 07:41.586
Some of these people have worked
in the Temple for years.

07:41.620 --> 07:46.157
Fear makes even the most
trusting individual irrational.

07:46.191 --> 07:51.195
I think I know who did it,
who blew up the hangar.

07:54.333 --> 07:55.567
Who?

07:55.601 --> 07:58.870
I believe it was Jackar Bowmani.

07:58.905 --> 08:00.773
Jackar Bowmani.

08:00.807 --> 08:02.040
Who is Jackar?

08:02.075 --> 08:04.610
One of the maintenance crew
in the hangar.

08:04.644 --> 08:06.245
Why do you think it was him?

08:06.280 --> 08:10.716
I passed him as I was going
on my shift change.

08:10.751 --> 08:12.919
He...
he had been working all morning

08:12.953 --> 08:15.088
in the section the blast came from.

08:15.122 --> 08:17.323
It was the last place I saw him.

08:17.358 --> 08:18.992
Is this him?

08:20.361 --> 08:21.728
Yes.

08:21.763 --> 08:24.998
I need to know, have you
seen him since the explosion?

08:25.033 --> 08:26.500
No.

08:26.534 --> 08:30.071
Truthfully, I didn't see much
of anything after the explosion.

08:31.406 --> 08:34.409
Thank you.

08:39.149 --> 08:42.784
Looks like we need to find
Jackar Bowmani, Russo.

08:50.961 --> 08:52.429
Did you find anything?

08:52.463 --> 08:56.367
No, but the rumor about it
being a Jedi is growing, Ahsoka.

08:56.401 --> 08:58.102
I can feel the anger and confusion

08:58.136 --> 08:59.270
throughout the Jedi Temple.

08:59.304 --> 09:01.205
Russo and I have a lead.

09:01.240 --> 09:04.442
We are looking for one of the
Temple workers, Jackar Bowmani.

09:04.476 --> 09:06.344
One of the witnesses saw him in the area

09:06.379 --> 09:09.148
where the bomb exploded
right before it happened,

09:09.182 --> 09:12.952
and we have not been able
to find him anywhere.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.721
Come on.
Nobody just disappears.

09:15.756 --> 09:18.491
Unless it was well planned out.

09:18.525 --> 09:21.161
Well, it had to be well
planned out to get past Jedi.

09:21.195 --> 09:26.132
I'll talk to security.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.867
No more clones.

09:27.902 --> 09:29.369
Stop the violence.

09:29.403 --> 09:30.904
End the war.

09:30.938 --> 09:33.473
Stop the violence.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.682
They're all family and friends?

09:43.717 --> 09:46.018
Yes, looking for answers.

09:46.053 --> 09:47.687
So am I, Cin.

09:47.721 --> 09:50.589
This is the guy who might be
behind all of this.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.825
If you see him, alert me immediately.

09:55.395 --> 09:56.829
That is Jackar.

09:56.864 --> 09:58.264
You know this man?

09:58.298 --> 09:59.898
He is my husband.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.735
I've been trying to reach him
since I heard of an explosion.

10:02.769 --> 10:03.769
Where is he?

10:03.803 --> 10:05.638
I need you to come with me.

10:12.746 --> 10:15.348
You have no idea where Jackar is?

10:15.382 --> 10:16.549
No.

10:16.583 --> 10:19.786
You are a Jedi, and you cannot find him?

10:19.820 --> 10:22.055
I understand your frustration.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.457
Don't.
Just find Jackar.

10:24.492 --> 10:28.328
Letta, do you think Jackar
could do something like this,

10:28.362 --> 10:29.663
blow up the Temple?

10:29.697 --> 10:32.098
Do you have any idea
what someone has to go through

10:32.133 --> 10:34.401
to work in the Jedi Temple, hm?

10:34.435 --> 10:37.571
Jackar dedicated his life
to serving the Jedi.

10:37.605 --> 10:39.006
It had been his dream.

10:39.040 --> 10:42.242
Not just anyone can walk into
your precious Temple.

10:42.277 --> 10:44.711
He passed all the entry tests
that were needed.

10:44.745 --> 10:47.114
Okay, I had to ask.

10:47.148 --> 10:49.850
Unfortunately, everyone's a suspect.

10:49.884 --> 10:52.420
Jackar would never do anything
like this.

10:52.454 --> 10:54.556
Please, find him.

11:26.421 --> 11:27.655
Hmm...

11:27.689 --> 11:31.192
based on the trajectory of the debris,

11:31.226 --> 11:35.129
it seems the blast came from there.

11:35.164 --> 11:38.099
Why is there no bomb residue?

11:38.134 --> 11:40.969
So you think whoever did this
triggered a ship to explode?

11:41.004 --> 11:42.404
We think so.

11:42.438 --> 11:45.974
Russo's trying to use the
shrapnel to determine that now.

11:46.008 --> 11:48.743
The witness says he saw Jackar
in the area.

11:48.778 --> 11:53.081
Maybe Jackar planned to do this
and just kept quiet.

11:53.115 --> 11:54.215
Or...

11:54.250 --> 11:56.818
It actually was a Jedi.

11:59.255 --> 12:04.125
I found something, an anomaly,

12:04.159 --> 12:07.562
something that should not be here.

12:15.503 --> 12:18.505
These pieces came from the blast origin.

12:18.540 --> 12:21.408
They are covered with microscopic droids

12:21.442 --> 12:23.443
of a highly volatile nature.

12:23.478 --> 12:25.946
Nano-droids.

12:25.980 --> 12:30.317
Yes, nano-droids.

12:30.351 --> 12:31.851
Great.

12:31.886 --> 12:34.621
Now we're chasing nano-droids.

12:34.655 --> 12:36.589
Russo, go through security footage.

12:36.624 --> 12:39.425
Try to see if Jackar went
to other parts of the Temple.

12:39.460 --> 12:41.861
Ahsoka, let's go find out
how Jackar got his hands

12:41.895 --> 12:44.663
on these nano-droids.

12:51.370 --> 12:53.704
Bowmani's file, Master Jedi.

12:53.739 --> 12:56.207
He's a munitions expert.

12:56.241 --> 12:59.010
Jackar was the foreman over
all of the gunships,

12:59.044 --> 13:00.878
bombs, and weapons.

13:00.913 --> 13:02.781
His specialty was nano-weaponry.

13:02.815 --> 13:06.051
We've got to find this guy.

13:09.989 --> 13:11.623
Isn't that going a little
too fast for you

13:11.657 --> 13:12.824
to make sense out of it?

13:12.858 --> 13:14.393
It is simple data.

13:14.427 --> 13:18.530
At this pace, I am able to view
hundreds of hours of footage.

13:18.564 --> 13:21.299
Have you found Jackar?

13:21.334 --> 13:22.534
No.

13:22.568 --> 13:25.470
I'll gather some Jedi
and search the Temple.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.939
If he's still here, he might be
planning another attack.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.174
Instead of Jedi,

13:29.208 --> 13:31.944
I have droids
that can do the job much faster.

13:46.358 --> 13:48.893
So you've found nothing so far?

13:48.928 --> 13:50.561
We have a clue we're following.

13:50.596 --> 13:52.430
But we still don't have answers.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.637
It is imperative
that the truth be found soon.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.739
There are whispers
the Senate will have a meeting

14:00.773 --> 14:02.708
to decide whether the military police

14:02.742 --> 14:05.410
will need to become involved
in the investigation.

14:05.444 --> 14:07.045
They can't do that.

14:09.047 --> 14:10.815
Clones died in that explosion,

14:10.849 --> 14:12.583
maintenance clones working
on the gunships

14:12.617 --> 14:13.984
as well as civilians.

14:14.019 --> 14:17.054
The Senate tends to take notice
of these things

14:17.089 --> 14:19.991
no matter where they happen.

14:21.560 --> 14:24.961
Master Skywalker, we have found Jackar.

14:24.996 --> 14:27.464
Lock down all exits so he can't escape.

14:39.509 --> 14:40.709
Where is he?

14:40.744 --> 14:44.380
Well, part of him is here.

14:44.415 --> 14:47.283
I don't think now
is a good time to joke.

14:48.585 --> 14:51.920
This is all that remains of Jackar.

14:51.954 --> 14:53.355
His hand?

14:53.389 --> 14:56.424
The rest of him exploded.

14:56.459 --> 14:57.939
Because he was so close to the bomb?

14:57.960 --> 15:01.095
Because he was the bomb.

15:02.998 --> 15:04.265
What's this?

15:04.299 --> 15:05.933
The connection we were looking for

15:05.968 --> 15:08.403
to the explosion in the hangar.

15:08.437 --> 15:10.472
The nano-droids.

15:10.506 --> 15:12.808
How did they get in his bloodstream?

15:12.842 --> 15:16.011
Oh, this just keeps getting
better and better.

15:16.046 --> 15:18.614
We're going to have to search
Jackar's home for evidence.

15:50.500 --> 15:52.334
This is not the nicest place.

15:52.369 --> 15:56.004
I would've thought working
for the Jedi paid better.

16:05.814 --> 16:08.416
Letta?
Are you here?

16:08.450 --> 16:11.353
You search for the droids,
but be careful,

16:11.387 --> 16:14.757
and remember, he was a munitions expert.

16:14.791 --> 16:17.760
I'd rather not set off
another explosion today.

16:17.794 --> 16:19.963
I'll see if he left a note.

17:09.080 --> 17:12.083
Letta?

17:34.839 --> 17:37.675
Master.

17:37.709 --> 17:40.778
The sensors are picking up
traces from the disposal.

17:42.280 --> 17:44.348
The nano-droids
were in the food.

17:44.382 --> 17:46.650
Well, I guess the question now is,

17:46.685 --> 17:49.587
did he eat them willingly,
or did someone feed them to him?

17:49.621 --> 17:52.356
Wh-what are you doing here?

17:52.391 --> 17:54.826
We've learned Jackar
was involved in the bombing.

17:54.860 --> 17:56.194
That can't be true.

17:56.228 --> 17:59.597
See if she has any nano-droids
on her, Ahsoka.

18:02.568 --> 18:06.204
Nanodroids?

18:06.238 --> 18:07.305
She's clean.

18:07.339 --> 18:10.007
What do you mean,
"nano-droids"?

18:10.042 --> 18:14.378
We believe someone set Jackar
up and made him the bomb.

18:16.614 --> 18:19.316
I...
I don't understand.

18:19.350 --> 18:22.051
Letta, I want to bring you in
for more questioning.

18:22.086 --> 18:27.089
Maybe you can help us make sense
out of all of this.

18:27.124 --> 18:30.660
I'll answer any question I can.

18:48.746 --> 18:50.113
Letta, stop.

18:50.147 --> 18:52.849
Letta!

18:56.321 --> 18:57.454
Letta.

19:00.893 --> 19:01.960
Take the high road.

19:01.994 --> 19:06.798
Right, Master.

19:36.128 --> 19:37.194
Letta, stop!

19:42.066 --> 19:43.433
Let me go.

19:43.468 --> 19:45.569
Running means you know more
than you're telling us.

19:45.603 --> 19:47.003
Jackar is dead,

19:47.038 --> 19:49.506
and now you're trying to blame
his murder on me.

19:49.541 --> 19:52.577
Nobody ever said he was dead.

19:54.613 --> 19:58.283
But running proves you had
something to do with the bomb.

19:58.317 --> 20:00.552
You don't know what
you're talking about.

20:00.586 --> 20:03.021
People blamed Jedi because of you.

20:03.056 --> 20:05.558
People were killed because of you!

20:05.592 --> 20:07.593
You can't prove anything.

20:07.628 --> 20:10.897
Did you feed the nano-droids
to Jackar?

20:10.931 --> 20:12.932
You will answer me.

20:12.966 --> 20:14.300
Now!

20:17.404 --> 20:19.972
I did feed the nano-droids
to Jackar.

20:20.007 --> 20:23.109
You set up your own husband to die?

20:23.143 --> 20:26.245
You're dealing with things
you don't understand.

20:27.681 --> 20:29.082
Oh, where you're going,

20:29.116 --> 20:33.186
you'll have plenty of time
to explain everything.

20:35.156 --> 20:37.116
We're holding Letta
in the cell below the temple

20:37.124 --> 20:39.559
to await further questioning.

20:39.593 --> 20:42.728
I am pleased to report
there were no other nano-droids

20:42.763 --> 20:45.231
found in the sweep of the Temple.

20:45.265 --> 20:49.868
I am also pleased to report,
based on the security footage,

20:49.903 --> 20:53.238
Jackar Bowmani acted alone,

20:53.272 --> 20:57.141
which means no Jedi was involved.

20:57.176 --> 20:58.276
Thanks, Russo.

20:58.310 --> 21:00.378
Good job.

21:00.412 --> 21:03.781
Did this woman say what her
reasons were for attacking us?

21:03.815 --> 21:06.250
Not yet, but we're working on that.

21:06.284 --> 21:08.919
I think we can guess
her motives easily enough.

21:08.953 --> 21:10.687
Public opinion is
swaying against the Jedi.

21:10.722 --> 21:14.191
That is becoming clear.

21:15.660 --> 21:18.028
This war is becoming less
and less popular

21:18.062 --> 21:20.030
every day it persists.

21:23.501 --> 21:26.237
Master, I'm relieved
we solved this case, but--

21:26.271 --> 21:28.138
- What if it had been a Jedi?

21:28.173 --> 21:29.173
Yes.

21:29.207 --> 21:30.528
I don't know how I would have felt

21:30.542 --> 21:32.442
if a Jedi was really behind this.

21:32.477 --> 21:36.914
There are going to be Jedi
who disappoint us, Ahsoka.

21:36.949 --> 21:39.216
But as long as we know
there are good Jedi

21:39.251 --> 21:43.887
who fight for what's right,
it makes it all worthwhile.
