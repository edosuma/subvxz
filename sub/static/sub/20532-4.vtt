00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:09.610 --> 00:12.378
¶ I was a girl in the village
doing all right ¶

00:12.380 --> 00:14.780
¶ Then I became
a princess overnight ¶

00:14.782 --> 00:17.549
¶ Now I gotta figure out
how to do it right ¶

00:17.551 --> 00:19.985
¶ So much to learn
and see ¶

00:19.987 --> 00:22.454
¶ Up in the castle
with my new family ¶

00:22.456 --> 00:25.157
¶ In a school that's
just for royalty ¶

00:25.159 --> 00:29.528
¶ A whole enchanted world
is waiting for me ¶

00:29.530 --> 00:32.197
- ¶ I'm so excited to be ¶
- ¶ Sofia the First ¶

00:32.199 --> 00:36.535
¶ I'm finding out what
being royal's all about ¶

00:36.537 --> 00:38.170
¶ Sofia the First ¶

00:38.172 --> 00:41.407
¶ Making my way,
it's an adventure every day ¶

00:41.409 --> 00:43.208
¶ Sofia ¶

00:43.210 --> 00:45.244
- ¶ It's gonna be my time ¶
- ¶ Sofia ¶

00:45.246 --> 00:51.316
¶ To show them all
that I'm Sofia the First ¶

01:01.529 --> 01:05.597
We have some time
before our trade discussions
begin, King Roland.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.566
Is there something you would
like to do first?

01:07.568 --> 01:09.268
How about a quick tour
of the market

01:09.270 --> 01:10.569
while we wait,
King Habib?

01:10.571 --> 01:12.905
I'd like to get
a new shawl for Miranda.

01:12.907 --> 01:15.441
And I'd like to see
my friend Kazeem.
How's he doing?

01:15.443 --> 01:19.211
Kazeem?
The mischief-making genie?

01:19.213 --> 01:21.447
Please excuse
my new royal wizard.

01:21.449 --> 01:24.616
Omar is not fond
of genies.

01:24.618 --> 01:27.619
Why should I be, sire?
Magic is serious.

01:27.621 --> 01:30.222
Royal wizards like me
are serious.

01:30.224 --> 01:33.225
Genies, on the other hand,
are silly.

01:33.227 --> 01:35.461
Maybe Kazeem
was mischievous before,

01:35.463 --> 01:37.296
but now he's
on the Genie Patrol.

01:37.298 --> 01:39.031
He takes that
very seriously.

01:39.033 --> 01:40.599
- ( honking )
- Look out!

01:43.471 --> 01:47.606
- Kazeem!
- Uh, sorry!

01:47.608 --> 01:51.043
( clears throat )
I rest my case.

01:52.646 --> 01:55.247
Can't talk now, Sofia.
Genie biz!

01:55.249 --> 01:58.450
A rogue genie's on the loose
breaking all the genie rules!

01:58.452 --> 02:01.720
( laughing )
Ali Bobo is free of his lamp!

02:01.722 --> 02:04.590
Who has a wish
for Ali Bobo?

02:04.592 --> 02:07.326
I wish you would make
me a birthday cake.

02:07.328 --> 02:08.627
Watch out!
It's a trick!

02:08.629 --> 02:12.664
Ali kapow!
You are a birthday cake.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.666
This is not
what I expected.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.401
Oh, my!
What shall we do?

02:16.403 --> 02:18.170
- Kazeem will take care of it.
- ( whistles )

02:18.172 --> 02:20.372
( revving )

02:21.342 --> 02:23.842
Ali Bobo made a funny!

02:23.844 --> 02:25.844
Pull it over, Ali Bobo!

02:25.846 --> 02:27.813
No chance!

02:29.283 --> 02:31.383
Kablooie!

02:35.656 --> 02:37.689
Can't escape
the long arm
of the law!

02:37.691 --> 02:40.759
Ali Boba never gets
to have fun!

02:40.761 --> 02:43.028
Nobody says you
can't have fun, Bobo.

02:43.030 --> 02:46.331
You just gotta
follow the rules.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.700
Sergeant Fizz!

02:48.702 --> 02:51.336
Afternoon,
Princess Sofia.

02:51.338 --> 02:52.971
Nice work,
junior patrolman.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.706
Now, finish the job.

02:54.708 --> 02:59.378
Hey! I may be delicious,
but I am still a person.

02:59.380 --> 03:03.182
Kablooie!
Uh, nothing happened.

03:03.184 --> 03:04.983
Genie rule number 21:

03:04.985 --> 03:07.786
only the genie who grants a wish
can undo that wish.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.154
Right! I forgot.

03:09.156 --> 03:11.990
Unmake that cake,
rogue genie!

03:11.992 --> 03:13.825
Okay, okay.

03:13.827 --> 03:17.529
Ali-kaboom.

03:17.531 --> 03:18.764
Lamp him, Kazeem.

03:26.340 --> 03:29.208
And that's how we do it
in the genie patrol.

03:29.210 --> 03:31.343
Well done,
genie patrol!

03:31.345 --> 03:33.212
Your majesty,
Junior Patrolman Kazeem and I

03:33.214 --> 03:35.247
have now rounded up
all rogue genies

03:35.249 --> 03:36.715
and confined them
to their lamps

03:36.717 --> 03:40.252
until they learn
to follow the Genie Rules.

03:40.254 --> 03:43.855
Ahh! I reward you both
with a day off!

03:43.857 --> 03:47.426
A day off? Great! Kazeem,
can you join us in the market?

03:47.428 --> 03:49.194
That sounds
fun-tastic, Sofia.

03:49.196 --> 03:51.163
I'd love to!

03:51.165 --> 03:55.667
Ahem. If I may,
this little genie may
be playing hero now,

03:55.669 --> 03:58.770
but not too long ago
wasn't he a rogue genie?

03:58.772 --> 04:00.439
Granting
wishes
willy-nilly,

04:00.441 --> 04:01.773
conjuring
huge cookies,

04:01.775 --> 04:03.909
putting wings
on a camel?

04:03.911 --> 04:05.677
Oh, but that was before.

04:05.679 --> 04:09.214
Didn't he slam
his flying carpet
into me just now?

04:09.216 --> 04:13.051
He's a menace
and should be confined
to his lamp as well.

04:13.053 --> 04:14.853
It was an accident!

04:14.855 --> 04:18.390
Oh, I think we can pardon
a little youthful energy.

04:18.392 --> 04:20.592
Sire, I'd stake
my reputation on the kid.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.694
If he's a menace,
so am I.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.863
As you say,
Sergeant Fizz.

04:24.865 --> 04:27.599
Now, let us all go
to the market.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.703
You go, kid.

04:31.705 --> 04:34.206
I'll take this rogue genie
back to HQ and book him.

04:34.208 --> 04:36.541
The Genie Patrol's work
is never done.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.282
Omar's wrong, Kazeem.

04:43.284 --> 04:45.250
I can see how much
you've changed.

04:45.252 --> 04:48.920
Thanks to you, Sofia,
for helping me become
a junior patrolman.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.289
( camels grunting )

04:50.291 --> 04:52.591
Apologies, friends,
for the delay.

04:52.593 --> 04:55.661
Shoo, camels, shoo!
How embarrassing!

04:55.663 --> 04:59.464
I wish these camels
would just get out of our way.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.501
Hey, wait!
Stop that!

05:02.503 --> 05:05.337
What is the meaning
of this? Whoa!

05:08.676 --> 05:10.842
King Habib!
Careful!

05:21.322 --> 05:22.621
What happened?

05:22.623 --> 05:24.589
I have no idea!

05:25.492 --> 05:27.859
Achoo!

05:27.861 --> 05:31.763
If I may...
it's perfectly clear
what happened.

05:31.765 --> 05:34.766
King Habib made a wish
that the camels
would move,

05:34.768 --> 05:38.170
and this genie
mischievously
granted it.

05:38.172 --> 05:40.339
- No, I didn't!
- Then who did?

05:40.341 --> 05:43.942
Sergeant Fizz said all rogue
genies are bottled up.

05:43.944 --> 05:46.144
Kazeem said
he didn't do it,

05:46.146 --> 05:48.513
- and I believe him.
- Thanks, Sofia.

05:48.515 --> 05:52.517
But did he not give a camel
wings once before?

05:52.519 --> 05:55.887
Sure, once, but what
does that have--

05:55.889 --> 05:57.856
I rest my case
once again.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.292
Like all genies,
he's a menace.

06:00.294 --> 06:03.762
Sire, I recommend
you remove him
from the genie patrol

06:03.764 --> 06:05.831
and banish him
to his lamp.

06:05.833 --> 06:06.832
- No!
- No!

06:06.834 --> 06:08.166
Enough! I am sure

06:08.168 --> 06:09.735
there is an explanation
for all of this.

06:09.737 --> 06:12.671
You're not back to playing
tricks, are you, my boy?

06:12.673 --> 06:15.040
No way, sire! I'm
not like that anymore!

06:15.042 --> 06:18.009
- Achoo!
- ( laughing )

06:18.011 --> 06:19.845
You see?
He's laughing!

06:19.847 --> 06:22.748
It's all a big joke
to him.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.015
I didn't mean to.

06:24.017 --> 06:26.818
He sneezed,
and it was funny.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.387
Hmph, I see!

06:28.389 --> 06:30.655
Well, if there is
any more funny business,

06:30.657 --> 06:33.825
Kazeem, there will
be consequences.
Understood?

06:33.827 --> 06:36.528
- No more tricks.
- Yes, sire.

06:36.530 --> 06:39.097
King Roland, let us
get cleaned up.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.733
I'll just be
a few minutes, Sofia.

06:41.735 --> 06:42.934
Okay, Dad.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.403
Thanks for sticking
by me, Sofia.

06:44.405 --> 06:45.837
Of course, Kazeem!

06:45.839 --> 06:48.740
But I'm afraid
I'm the only one
who believes you.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.843
What I don't get is
someone granted that wish.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.011
But who?

06:53.013 --> 06:55.213
( sighs ) It's a mystery,
for sure.

06:55.215 --> 07:00.919
Luckily, we know someone
who can solve any genie mystery.

07:05.259 --> 07:08.026
All you gotta do, Bobo,
is learn the genie rules

07:08.028 --> 07:10.429
and you're out... unless
someone rubs your lamp first.

07:10.431 --> 07:13.265
Ali Bobo
doesn't
like rules!

07:13.267 --> 07:15.700
Ali Bobo would
rather escape!

07:15.702 --> 07:17.536
Yep, that's what
they all say.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.404
Sergeant Fizz?
We need your help.

07:19.406 --> 07:20.872
Okay, give me
the rundown.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.808
The rundown, right!

07:22.810 --> 07:24.476
King Habib wished
some camels would move

07:24.478 --> 07:25.977
and they got wings
and they made a mess,

07:25.979 --> 07:27.412
and I laughed
when I shouldn't have

07:27.414 --> 07:29.815
and everyone thinks
I did it, but I didn't!

07:29.817 --> 07:31.416
I know Kazeem
didn't do it,

07:31.418 --> 07:32.884
but how do we
prove it?

07:32.886 --> 07:35.487
Well, that's not
Sergeant Fizz's department.

07:35.489 --> 07:38.156
You need Detective Fizz,
Private Eye!

07:38.158 --> 07:39.891
So, what are we
going to do, Sarge--

07:39.893 --> 07:42.060
I mean,
Detective Fizz?

07:42.062 --> 07:44.062
We are going to investigate.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.897
Take me to the scene
of the charm.

07:45.899 --> 07:48.300
Okay, this is where
King Habib made his wish,

07:48.302 --> 07:50.502
and that's where
the camels got wings.

07:50.504 --> 07:53.171
Step one of any
investigation:
dust for fingerprints.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.841
How do we dust sand
for fingerprints, Sarge?

07:55.843 --> 07:58.310
The same way we do anything,
kid: with style.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.951
There are a hundred magic-makers
in this kingdom,

08:05.953 --> 08:08.019
and every spell they cast
tells a story.

08:08.021 --> 08:10.589
So that powder
will tell you
who cast the spell?

08:10.591 --> 08:14.259
Close, Sofia.
It'll tell us what kind
of magic-maker cast it.

08:14.261 --> 08:16.094
It might not even be a genie.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.863
I didn't think of that!

08:17.865 --> 08:20.499
It could've been a witch
or a fairy or a sorcerer!

08:20.501 --> 08:22.434
This'll prove
I'm innocent, easy!

08:29.943 --> 08:32.310
Bull's eye!
It was a genie.

08:32.312 --> 08:34.379
It wasn't me,
I swear!

08:34.381 --> 08:35.947
Hold on,
Detective Fizz.

08:35.949 --> 08:38.884
Just because it was
a genie doesn't mean
it was Kazeem.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.785
Good point.
On to step two:

08:40.787 --> 08:42.320
interrogate
the witnesses.

08:42.322 --> 08:44.022
Where were you
this morning, miss?

08:44.024 --> 08:47.325
Um, standing right here?

08:47.327 --> 08:50.295
So, you have
no alibi, eh?

08:50.297 --> 08:54.065
No, but I have turbans
and headscarves!

08:54.067 --> 08:55.066
How 'bout a fez?

08:55.068 --> 08:56.968
I'll ask
the questions here.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.370
Ooh, do you have
that in red?

09:02.976 --> 09:07.012
Hello, Mr. Camel,
may I ask you a question?

09:07.014 --> 09:09.080
- You talkin' to me?
- Yes.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.850
Did you notice
anything strange today?

09:11.852 --> 09:13.552
You mean
before I got wings

09:13.554 --> 09:15.353
and met a girl who
understands camel?

09:15.355 --> 09:16.988
Yeah, right before then.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.590
Um, I was wondering,

09:18.592 --> 09:21.560
did you happen to see
who cast the spell on you?

09:21.562 --> 09:24.930
Nope. But I did see
where the magic
flash came from,

09:24.932 --> 09:26.364
right over there.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.166
A clue! Thank you.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.935
No fuzz off my hump.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.937
Gotta fly!

09:37.177 --> 09:39.077
What'd you find, Sofia?

09:39.079 --> 09:41.179
That camel said the spell
that changed him
came from here.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.113
And look what I found!

09:42.115 --> 09:43.748
Do you think--?

09:43.750 --> 09:45.584
It belongs to the genie
who cast the spell!

09:45.586 --> 09:48.219
Yes, I do!
Let's show Detective Fizz!

09:48.221 --> 09:51.790
So, you want the turban
and the scarf and the fez?

09:51.792 --> 09:54.059
Just the fez, ma'am.
Just the fez.

09:54.061 --> 09:55.827
Detective Fizz,
I found a clue!

09:57.064 --> 09:59.397
Bingo! Give me
the short version.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.132
According to a flying camel,

10:01.134 --> 10:03.101
this belongs
to the guilty genie.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.970
Now you'll know
it wasn't me!

10:04.972 --> 10:06.037
So to find
the guilty genie,

10:06.039 --> 10:07.639
we've just gotta figure out

10:07.641 --> 10:10.008
who is missing
this trinket from his...

10:12.813 --> 10:14.145
Oh,
Kazeem...

10:14.147 --> 10:16.114
I didn't do it!

10:16.116 --> 10:17.749
Kid, you're in a pickle,

10:17.751 --> 10:19.417
and I don't mean the kind
you put on a sandwich.

10:19.419 --> 10:22.120
Sofia,
you believe me, right?

10:22.122 --> 10:25.156
Well, I, uh...

10:25.158 --> 10:27.993
I should really
catch up with my dad.

10:27.995 --> 10:29.761
You still believe me, right?

10:29.763 --> 10:34.332
Kazeem, are you sure
you didn't, you know,

10:34.334 --> 10:37.235
grant this one
little wish for fun?

10:37.237 --> 10:39.004
You can tell me.

10:39.006 --> 10:42.107
- No!
- Then I believe you.

10:42.109 --> 10:45.944
( crunching ) Oh,
these are delicious,
King Habib!

10:45.946 --> 10:48.013
I wish you could sample
all the fruits

10:48.015 --> 10:50.315
and vegetables of Tangu.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.450
Look out!

10:52.452 --> 10:53.585
Huh?

10:58.959 --> 11:00.825
I cannot believe this.

11:00.827 --> 11:03.662
Twice in one day!
How humiliating.

11:03.664 --> 11:06.131
I don't understand.
What just happened?

11:06.133 --> 11:07.799
If I may...

11:07.801 --> 11:10.101
This is more
genie mischief.

11:10.103 --> 11:13.304
King Habib wished
for fruits and vegetables,

11:13.306 --> 11:16.441
and that's exactly
what Kazeem gave him.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.309
I didn't! I promise!

11:18.311 --> 11:23.815
Sire, I insist that you banish
him to his lamp immediately.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.817
Think of your wardrobe!

11:25.819 --> 11:27.385
Sire, please!

11:27.387 --> 11:29.888
I am sorry,
but even a king

11:29.890 --> 11:32.190
has only so many
formal outfits.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.892
It is time to decide
once and for all

11:33.894 --> 11:35.393
whether you are guilty
of this crime.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.861
Detective Fizz?

11:36.863 --> 11:40.198
One Genie Corps trial
coming right up.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.201
Order in the court!
Order in the court!

11:43.203 --> 11:44.569
Hear ye, hear ye.

11:44.571 --> 11:46.304
The case of Kingdom
versus Kazeem

11:46.306 --> 11:48.139
will now kick off.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.141
- What's happening?
- I'm not sure.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.843
You're on trial,
Kazeem.

11:51.845 --> 11:54.212
Omar will show evidence
of why he thinks you did it,

11:54.214 --> 11:56.314
and the king will decide
if he's right.

11:57.584 --> 12:01.486
As my first witness
I call Detective Fizz.

12:05.358 --> 12:07.959
I've got your back, kid.

12:10.163 --> 12:11.730
Do you swear
to tell the truth?

12:11.732 --> 12:13.331
- Always.
- So, Detective,

12:13.333 --> 12:15.366
I understand you've
been investigating

12:15.368 --> 12:18.002
the case
of the mischievous wishes?

12:18.004 --> 12:20.105
Yes, I dusted
for magical fingerprints

12:20.107 --> 12:21.906
to see who gave
the camels wings.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.075
- And was it Kazeem?
- It was a genie.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.543
But that doesn't mean
it was Kazeem.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.679
- What else did you find?
- Just a trinket near

12:27.681 --> 12:29.247
where the camel spell
was cast from.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.116
And did it belong
to Kazeem?

12:31.118 --> 12:33.418
- It did, but...
- And wasn't Kazeem

12:33.420 --> 12:35.086
the only other genie around

12:35.088 --> 12:37.055
when all fruit
fell on King Habib?

12:37.057 --> 12:38.623
Sure, but that doesn't mean
the kid's guilty.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.892
Then who is?
You told the king

12:40.894 --> 12:44.295
all the other rogue genies
are safely in their lamps.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.964
Didn't you?

12:45.966 --> 12:47.465
Well, I did. I mean...

12:47.467 --> 12:49.100
Well, they are, but...

12:49.102 --> 12:51.202
You must tell
the truth, Detective.

12:51.204 --> 12:54.773
What do all these facts
point to?

12:54.775 --> 12:55.974
I guess...

13:03.250 --> 13:05.784
The facts point to Kazeem.

13:05.786 --> 13:07.485
Sarge, no!

13:07.487 --> 13:10.388
I rest my case.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.724
What a shame!

13:12.726 --> 13:14.159
Your Honor, wait!

13:14.161 --> 13:15.393
I'd like to say
something.

13:15.395 --> 13:16.861
You may proceed,
Princess Sofia.

13:20.567 --> 13:24.335
I know Kazeem.
He's a good genie,

13:24.337 --> 13:26.437
but anyone
can make a mistake.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.306
Please, Kazeem,
just say you're sorry

13:28.308 --> 13:30.608
and maybe they won't
put you in your lamp.

13:30.610 --> 13:31.943
I object!

13:31.945 --> 13:33.511
On what grounds?

13:33.513 --> 13:35.947
On the grounds
that I thought
you were my friend.

13:35.949 --> 13:37.749
I am your friend, Kazeem!

13:37.751 --> 13:40.185
And I don't want
to see you get lamped!

13:40.187 --> 13:42.987
Just, please,
say you're sorry.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.489
I didn't do it!

13:44.491 --> 13:46.424
I have heard enough!

13:46.426 --> 13:49.594
I am sorry, Kazeem.
I must find you guilty.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.930
Remove him
from the Genie Patrol

13:51.932 --> 13:54.432
and confine him to his lamp
until further notice!

13:54.434 --> 13:56.401
Sergeant at arms?

14:02.943 --> 14:05.710
Sorry, kid,

14:05.712 --> 14:07.011
but I've gotta...

14:07.013 --> 14:09.013
Lamp me.
I heard.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.149
Some partner
you turned out
to be.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.984
Kazeem, I'm
sorry, too.

14:12.986 --> 14:15.687
Yeah, sure you are.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.824
OMAR: If I may...

14:19.826 --> 14:24.028
I call Detective Fizz
back to the stand.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.263
- Me?
- Why?

14:26.466 --> 14:28.199
This is a little unorthodox,

14:28.201 --> 14:30.368
but if you insist.

14:31.571 --> 14:34.372
Detective, is it not true

14:34.374 --> 14:37.208
you staked your reputation
on Kazeem?

14:37.210 --> 14:39.310
Did you not say,
and I quote,

14:39.312 --> 14:43.014
"If he's a menace,
so am I"?

14:43.016 --> 14:44.148
Yeah, so?

14:44.150 --> 14:46.251
Your Honor, he admits
it himself!

14:46.253 --> 14:49.654
The entire Genie Patrol
is a menace!

14:49.656 --> 14:53.391
Detective Fizz must go
back into his lamp, too,

14:53.393 --> 14:57.228
and the Genie Patrol
must be disbanded!

14:57.230 --> 14:58.263
I object!

14:58.265 --> 15:00.265
Well, you did put

15:00.267 --> 15:02.033
your reputation
on the line

15:02.035 --> 15:03.434
when you vouched
for Kazeem.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.270
I am sorry, Detective.

15:05.272 --> 15:07.438
Please pack up
Genie Patrol headquarters

15:07.440 --> 15:09.374
and return
to your lamp by sundown.

15:09.376 --> 15:10.608
Court adjourned!

15:12.445 --> 15:14.512
What can we do,
Detective Fizz?

15:14.514 --> 15:17.415
It's not "detective"
anymore, Sofia,

15:17.417 --> 15:19.417
just plain old Fizz.

15:19.419 --> 15:23.154
I'm afraid this case
is closed.

15:24.257 --> 15:28.059
Hello! I've been looking
everywhere for a green shawl.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.560
Do you happen
to have one?

15:29.562 --> 15:31.529
Dad, I think
I made a mistake.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.064
At the trial?

15:33.066 --> 15:34.565
I'm confused!

15:34.567 --> 15:37.135
The facts seem to say
I shouldn't believe Kazeem,

15:37.137 --> 15:39.304
but in my heart
I still do.

15:39.306 --> 15:41.572
Are you sure you have
all the facts?

15:41.574 --> 15:43.775
What do you mean?
We investigated!

15:43.777 --> 15:45.777
Well, did you
look everywhere?

15:45.779 --> 15:49.914
We examined every inch
of where the camels got wings!

15:49.916 --> 15:53.451
But we haven't looked
at where all the fruit
fell on King Habib!

15:53.453 --> 15:54.919
Dad, you're a genius!

15:54.921 --> 15:56.654
I just know how
to keep looking

15:56.656 --> 15:58.723
until I find
what I'm after.

15:58.725 --> 15:59.824
Mom'll love it!

15:59.826 --> 16:02.527
And I love you.

16:03.997 --> 16:07.398
Sergeant Fizz, we have
to reopen the case!

16:07.400 --> 16:08.933
What are you doing?

16:08.935 --> 16:10.935
Packing up HQ,
Sofia.

16:10.937 --> 16:12.337
See this?

16:12.339 --> 16:14.439
I was gonna
make Kazeem

16:14.441 --> 16:17.241
a junior senior
junior patrolman,

16:17.243 --> 16:19.444
but not anymore.

16:19.446 --> 16:20.745
Are you crying?

16:20.747 --> 16:22.447
A Genie Patrolman
doesn't cry!

16:22.449 --> 16:26.017
But I'm not
a Genie Patrolman
anymore!

16:26.019 --> 16:27.585
( sobbing )

16:27.587 --> 16:32.056
Fizz, you and I both know
deep down Kazeem is innocent!

16:34.527 --> 16:36.594
You were at the trial.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.363
It's an open
and shut case.

16:38.365 --> 16:40.531
We have
to keep looking.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.533
We've gotta give him
one more chance!

16:42.535 --> 16:45.603
¶ A Genie Patrolman ¶

16:45.605 --> 16:49.374
¶ Has very tough views ¶

16:49.376 --> 16:52.210
¶ We stick to facts only ¶

16:52.212 --> 16:56.447
¶ We just follow the clues ¶

16:56.449 --> 16:58.483
¶ But what if the truth is ¶

16:58.485 --> 17:02.453
¶ Not clear at first glance? ¶

17:02.455 --> 17:04.622
¶ There's more to this story ¶

17:04.624 --> 17:08.793
¶ Give the kid
one more chance ¶

17:08.795 --> 17:10.995
¶ I've caught
lots of genies ¶

17:10.997 --> 17:14.999
¶ Who all went astray ¶

17:15.001 --> 17:17.468
¶ This kid's just like
they were ¶

17:17.470 --> 17:21.039
¶ In his lamp
he must stay ¶

17:21.041 --> 17:23.708
¶ We both know
Kazeem, though ¶

17:23.710 --> 17:27.879
¶ He just wouldn't lie ¶

17:27.881 --> 17:29.547
¶ Think out of the lamp ¶

17:29.549 --> 17:33.985
¶ Just give the kid
one more try ¶

17:33.987 --> 17:37.488
¶ My heart hears
what you're saying ¶

17:37.490 --> 17:40.491
¶ But my hard head
just says no ¶

17:40.493 --> 17:43.594
¶ Spend my days
jailing genies ¶

17:43.596 --> 17:46.564
¶ I ain't familiar
with hope ¶

17:46.566 --> 17:49.567
¶ I believe
in you, Sergeant ¶

17:49.569 --> 17:53.004
¶ Like I still believe
in Kazeem ¶

17:53.006 --> 17:56.274
¶ Don't give up
on your friends, Sergeant ¶

17:56.276 --> 18:02.213
¶ You are the genie
dream team ¶

18:02.215 --> 18:06.050
I hear what you're
singing, Princess,

18:06.052 --> 18:09.520
but how could we
just start a whole
new investigation?

18:09.522 --> 18:11.522
How else?

18:11.524 --> 18:12.690
With style!

18:14.894 --> 18:17.462
¶ I guess
what you're saying ¶

18:17.464 --> 18:21.466
¶ Is soften
my stance ¶

18:21.468 --> 18:23.367
¶ Believe in my gut ¶

18:23.369 --> 18:27.872
¶ And give the kid
one more chance ¶

18:27.874 --> 18:30.408
¶ You're not
just a gumshoe ¶

18:30.410 --> 18:33.711
¶ Stuck in an old dance ¶

18:33.713 --> 18:35.646
¶ You've learned
a new step ¶

18:35.648 --> 18:38.916
¶ I'll give the kid
one more chance ¶

18:38.918 --> 18:42.086
¶ He deserves
one more chance ¶

18:42.088 --> 18:49.660
BOTH: ¶ Give Kazeem
one more chance ¶

18:54.167 --> 18:56.834
Omar sesame.

18:57.904 --> 18:59.504
Fizz, stop!

18:59.506 --> 19:00.972
What do you
see, Sofia?

19:00.974 --> 19:04.008
Omar sesame.

19:04.010 --> 19:06.244
What's
genie rule 21, again?

19:06.246 --> 19:08.613
Only the genie
who grants a wish
can undo that wish.

19:08.615 --> 19:09.914
- Why?
- Look!

19:09.916 --> 19:12.950
Isn't Omar reversing
the fruit and vegetable spell?

19:12.952 --> 19:15.586
He is, but how
can he do that?

19:15.588 --> 19:18.089
He's a wizard,
not a genie.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.993
Let's follow him!

19:26.833 --> 19:30.601
Time for a little
victory relaxation!

19:30.603 --> 19:31.969
He's a genie!

19:31.971 --> 19:34.038
What was that,
a mouse?

19:34.040 --> 19:38.476
Or is my wagon
infested with genies?

19:38.478 --> 19:40.378
Who are you calling
a genie, genie?

19:40.380 --> 19:41.779
You're a genie, too!

19:41.781 --> 19:44.615
A genie pretending
to be a royal wizard.

19:44.617 --> 19:48.352
Can you blame me?
Genies are ridiculous.

19:48.354 --> 19:52.723
Growing up, I was surrounded
by silly genies like you,

19:52.725 --> 19:55.193
but I wanted to be
someone silliest.

19:55.195 --> 19:58.629
I dreamt of becoming
a royal wizard!

19:58.631 --> 20:00.398
Who was
stopping you?

20:00.400 --> 20:03.568
King Habib would never
take a genie seriously!

20:03.570 --> 20:06.637
There was only one way
to get the job of my dreams.

20:06.639 --> 20:09.674
Pretend not to be a genie.

20:09.676 --> 20:11.475
You had me fooled.

20:11.477 --> 20:14.478
I made it look like Kazeem
was making mischief again,

20:14.480 --> 20:17.648
when it was really
( chuckles ) yours truly.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.183
All to keep
the Genie Patrol

20:19.185 --> 20:21.319
from catching
the sneakiest
rogue genie of all.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.320
You!

20:22.322 --> 20:24.088
Good work, Detective.

20:24.090 --> 20:26.724
You deserve
a long vacation...

20:26.726 --> 20:29.193
in my lamp.

20:29.195 --> 20:31.195
- ( gasps )
- Most villains

20:31.197 --> 20:33.664
would laugh triumphantly
at this moment,

20:33.666 --> 20:36.667
but that
would be silly.

20:36.669 --> 20:39.103
Now, to fix
those flying camels

20:39.105 --> 20:40.972
before they make
even more trouble!

20:51.551 --> 20:55.186
Kazeem, I'm so sorry.
I was wrong about you.

20:55.188 --> 20:57.421
Can you ever forgive me?

20:57.423 --> 20:59.790
It's too late, Sofia.

20:59.792 --> 21:02.226
Friends are supposed
to stick by each other.

21:02.228 --> 21:03.861
You're right,

21:03.863 --> 21:06.030
and that's why I decided
to keep investigating--

21:06.032 --> 21:07.798
because
I believe in you,

21:07.800 --> 21:09.967
and I found proof
that you're innocent.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.469
- You did?
- It was Omar.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.037
He pinned
the blame on you,

21:13.039 --> 21:15.439
and now he's
captured Fizz,
and we need--

21:15.441 --> 21:17.041
The Genie Patrol!

21:17.043 --> 21:20.978
Come on, partner, we got
a rogue genie to catch.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.585
- Dad!
- Sofia?

21:27.587 --> 21:29.053
Why is Kazeem free?

21:29.055 --> 21:30.454
No time to explain, Dad.

21:30.456 --> 21:32.223
I need you
to bring King Habib

21:32.225 --> 21:34.458
to the shop where you got
Mom's shawl, right away.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.827
If you think
it's important,
I'm on it.

21:36.829 --> 21:39.230
Sofia, there he is!

21:39.232 --> 21:41.065
Omar sesame.

21:41.067 --> 21:42.266
Hold still!

21:42.268 --> 21:45.236
Hey, cut it out!
I like my wings.

21:45.238 --> 21:46.537
Kablooie!

21:48.074 --> 21:50.074
Well, well, well.

21:50.076 --> 21:51.909
The Genie Patrol!

21:51.911 --> 21:54.278
I thought I'd
gotten rid of you.

21:54.280 --> 21:55.346
SOFIA: Never!

21:56.416 --> 21:59.350
Come on!
He's getting away!

21:59.352 --> 22:01.752
Chase him towards
the shawl shop!

22:02.989 --> 22:04.588
We're turning you in!

22:04.590 --> 22:06.691
It's the end
of the alley
for you, Omar!

22:06.693 --> 22:10.328
Muhaha! The king
will never believe you.

22:10.330 --> 22:11.796
You're right.

22:11.798 --> 22:13.864
Your plan was too silly
for anyone to believe.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.533
Silly, me?

22:15.535 --> 22:17.835
I used my genie magic
to grant those wishes,

22:17.837 --> 22:20.137
and I made it look
like he did it.

22:20.139 --> 22:23.140
I'd say that's
seriously clever.

22:23.142 --> 22:26.377
And I'd say that is why
you're going into your lamp

22:26.379 --> 22:29.647
for a very, very long time.

22:29.649 --> 22:31.782
Guards, seize him!

22:31.784 --> 22:33.818
You'll never catch me!

22:33.820 --> 22:35.720
No!

22:35.722 --> 22:38.456
I am a royal wizard!

22:38.458 --> 22:43.861
This is so-- if I may--
undignified!

22:43.863 --> 22:44.795
Sergeant Fizz!

22:46.566 --> 22:48.866
Sofia! You sprung me out
of the hoosegow.

22:48.868 --> 22:50.735
- Uh, what?
- You saved me.

22:50.737 --> 22:52.570
It was Kazeem,
too, Sarge.

22:52.572 --> 22:54.705
I never doubted him.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.507
Okay, maybe
for a minute.

22:56.509 --> 22:59.243
Oh, kid, I blew it!
Can you ever forgive me?

22:59.245 --> 23:01.312
Mm, okay.

23:03.750 --> 23:07.718
That's my junior
senior junior patrolman.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.019
Thanks, Sarge!

23:09.021 --> 23:11.756
And thank you, Sofia,
for being a true friend.

23:11.758 --> 23:16.093
King Habib, look at this
wonderful green shawl
I found for my wife.

23:16.095 --> 23:18.462
Wow!
