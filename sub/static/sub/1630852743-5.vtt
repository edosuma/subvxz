00:01.530 --> 00:03.360
<i>[narrator] Previously,
on Worst Cooks in America...</i>

00:03.370 --> 00:05.370
Today is all about
the world of flavor.

00:05.370 --> 00:06.300
Oh, honey!

00:06.300 --> 00:08.240
This mouth is way too beautiful

00:08.240 --> 00:10.940
to be just shoving my face
into pasta.

00:10.940 --> 00:14.610
Anna's diving into this rack of
lamb like she is Dexter. This is scary.

00:14.610 --> 00:17.040
[exclaiming]
Get off of there!

00:18.680 --> 00:20.550
I burnt my hand!

00:20.550 --> 00:23.920
The recruit that will not be
moving forward is Cheyenne.

00:23.920 --> 00:24.990
[speaking]

00:24.990 --> 00:26.820
She should stay and I should go.

00:26.820 --> 00:30.920
Wow. Who knew lamb chops
could make people so emotional?

00:30.930 --> 00:32.990
<i>[narrator] You're about
to enter another dimension.</i>

00:33.000 --> 00:35.160
<i>A dimension of time and spice.</i>

00:35.160 --> 00:38.930
<i>A dimension of overcooked meat
and bad knife cuts.</i>

00:38.930 --> 00:42.000
<i>You've crossed over...
into "The Bad Food Zone."</i>

00:42.000 --> 00:43.370
<i>[narrator] Picture
if you will...</i>

00:43.370 --> 00:46.070
- Oh, that's a fire!
- All of it, it just disintegrated.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.340
<i>Two master chefs.</i>

00:47.340 --> 00:50.380
- This is not what I thought.
- [screaming]

00:50.380 --> 00:52.710
<i>- [narrator] Anne Burrell.
- [both screaming]</i>

00:52.720 --> 00:55.580
<i>[narrator] And newcomer
Chef Cliff Crooks as himself.</i>

00:55.580 --> 00:57.350
I feel like I'm living my
worst nightmare right now.

00:57.350 --> 00:59.020
Oh, damn it!
It's still on!

00:59.020 --> 01:01.460
<i>[narrator] Who must transform
these poor souls...</i>

01:01.460 --> 01:03.120
- [screams]
<i>- From TV dinners...</i>

01:03.130 --> 01:05.530
- [Anne] Are you stirring with a fork?
- No.

01:05.530 --> 01:06.860
<i>- To kitchen winners.
- [screams]</i>

01:06.860 --> 01:08.100
This is delicious.

01:08.100 --> 01:10.300
<i>- [narrator] Some are total strangers.
- Oh, oh, oh!</i>

01:10.300 --> 01:13.070
- These hips don't shake.
<i>- [narrator] Others, old friends.</i>

01:13.070 --> 01:14.400
No, no, no. It's that one
up there.

01:14.400 --> 01:18.410
<i>[narrator] But only person
will escape with $25,000.</i>

01:18.410 --> 01:19.710
[laughing]

01:19.710 --> 01:21.410
I'm living my dream!

01:21.410 --> 01:24.110
<i>- [narrator] A culinary nightmares so bad...
- Get the water in.</i>

01:24.110 --> 01:25.980
[all] Water, water, water.

01:25.980 --> 01:28.150
<i>I can't even do
this impression anymore!</i>

01:28.150 --> 01:29.950
Ew! Salmonella everywhere!

01:29.950 --> 01:31.850
I am having a heart attack.

01:31.850 --> 01:34.420
<i>- [narrator] Next stop...
- I'm a goblin.</i>

01:34.420 --> 01:38.290
Worst Cooks in America,
The Disaster Zone.

01:45.830 --> 01:47.030
[gasps]

01:47.540 --> 01:50.200
- Oh, my God!
- [all chuckling]

01:50.210 --> 01:52.540
[chuckling]

01:52.540 --> 01:53.940
- I love it.
- Oh!

01:53.940 --> 01:56.110
I am so excited.

01:56.110 --> 02:01.180
Welcome, recruits. Today, we
are heading down the rabbit hole

02:01.180 --> 02:06.120
to the wonderful, sweet,
delicious world of pastries.

02:06.120 --> 02:07.920
<i>[Hilda] I love sweets.</i>

02:07.920 --> 02:13.130
If there's a cake around, I'm the
very first person to grab the first slice.

02:13.130 --> 02:15.400
- I don't care if it's your birthday or not.
- [baby crying]

02:15.400 --> 02:18.970
We're starting off today
with a scavenger hunt.

02:18.970 --> 02:20.400
Ooh, yay!

02:20.400 --> 02:23.800
You'll need to work together to
solve the clues on nine playing cards.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.070
Which are hidden
throughout the camp.

02:26.080 --> 02:30.340
The first team to collect all their
cards will earn an enticing edge

02:30.350 --> 02:31.750
in the skill-drill cook.

02:32.710 --> 02:35.620
You'll have to win
your first clue

02:35.620 --> 02:39.390
by a rollicking game of croquet.

02:39.390 --> 02:42.960
- Yeah!
- You must select one recruit from each team to play.

02:42.960 --> 02:44.290
- [Cliff] Blue team?
- I'm choosing Eddie.

02:44.290 --> 02:45.890
- [Anne] Yeah. Red team?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

02:45.900 --> 02:48.000
- [all] Al!
- [Anne] All right.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.830
Your time stats right now.

02:49.830 --> 02:51.200
[all clamoring]

02:51.200 --> 02:53.070
[Marti] All right, let's go, Al!

02:53.070 --> 02:54.840
- [cheering]
- Let's go, Eddie!

02:54.840 --> 02:56.300
[team] Go, Eddie, go!

02:56.310 --> 02:59.370
Eddie looks like a giant hitting
a peanut with, like, a matchstick.

02:59.380 --> 03:00.740
[Peachez] Come on, Eddie!

03:01.410 --> 03:04.140
[all cheering]

03:04.910 --> 03:06.080
[Cheyenne] Go, Eddie!
Go, Eddie!

03:06.080 --> 03:08.480
[Peachez] Come on, Eddie.
Bring it back, bring it back!

03:08.480 --> 03:11.550
Eddie gets our first clue
and we are already ahead.

03:11.550 --> 03:13.850
- Read it out.
- "What sweet treat has no beginning,

03:13.860 --> 03:15.390
no end, and no middle?"

03:15.390 --> 03:19.160
- What sweet treat has no
beginning-- - [all] The donut, donut.

03:19.160 --> 03:20.590
Yeah, there you go,
there you go.

03:20.600 --> 03:23.300
- It's not this. Oh, it's a donut!
- [Bianca] Donut, donut!

03:23.300 --> 03:24.930
Lucky try. Yes, grab it,
grab it.

03:24.930 --> 03:26.400
One down.

03:26.400 --> 03:29.100
Find and taste the macarons.
Their flavor will hold your next clue.

03:29.100 --> 03:31.100
- Okay.
- Bring the whole thing.

03:31.110 --> 03:32.970
- Ah!
- Go, go, go.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.880
- Let's go red team.
- Pistachio.

03:34.880 --> 03:36.280
- Pistachio.
- Pistachio?

03:36.280 --> 03:37.510
Go find pistachio nuts.

03:37.510 --> 03:39.210
Oh, that's good!
[chuckles]

03:39.220 --> 03:41.050
[Peachez] We got this.
We're killing it, y'all.

03:41.050 --> 03:43.620
- Read it out loud.
- [reading card]

03:46.090 --> 03:48.120
- Carrot cake, carrot cake!
- Carrot cake! I've got it.

03:48.120 --> 03:50.720
- Carrot, carrot, carrot!
- [Peachez] Is it there? Yes!

03:50.730 --> 03:52.030
Yes, Cheyenne.

03:52.030 --> 03:55.160
Oh, you better work! Okay.
Unscramble the letters.

03:55.160 --> 03:56.130
Uh...

03:56.130 --> 03:58.200
"Olotacech pihcs?"

03:58.200 --> 04:00.930
- Spice?
- Let's go red team.

04:00.940 --> 04:02.370
Chocolate chips,
chocolate chips.

04:04.370 --> 04:05.940
Okay, go, go, go!

04:05.940 --> 04:08.510
A container without hinges,
lock, or a key...

04:08.510 --> 04:11.350
Yet a golden treasure
lies inside me. What am I?

04:11.350 --> 04:14.310
It's time to call in the
big guns. Mama, step it in!

04:14.320 --> 04:18.020
- What am I looking for?
- It has no lock and key.

04:18.020 --> 04:20.150
We are scratching our heads like
we are Tweedledee and Tweedledum.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.720
We could not figure this out.

04:21.720 --> 04:25.930
What do we have in here
that has gold or yellow inside?

04:25.930 --> 04:27.490
[Peachez] What's in there
that's... An egg!

04:27.500 --> 04:30.000
- Yes, yes, yes, yes!
- [Al] Gold, gold.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.870
- It's a gold thing inside of it.
- This?

04:31.870 --> 04:34.470
My team seems to be a little
challenged at these games.

04:34.470 --> 04:37.040
- Yellow on the inside.
<i>- [Marti] Duh.</i>

04:37.040 --> 04:38.340
There's no hinges!

04:38.340 --> 04:40.170
- [Anne] Listen to Kara.
- Okay, Kara.

04:40.180 --> 04:41.140
[whispering] Eggs!

04:41.140 --> 04:43.010
It's an egg!

04:43.010 --> 04:45.610
Come here, come here!
Okay, okay, okay.

04:45.610 --> 04:47.450
Find this ingredient
in the word search.

04:47.450 --> 04:49.050
I love a word search.

04:49.050 --> 04:50.850
Call me an old lady,
if you want.

04:50.850 --> 04:53.520
- No. Mint!
- Mint, mint, mint!

04:53.520 --> 04:55.360
-Spice? Where's the
spinach? There's no-- -Spinach.

04:55.360 --> 04:57.090
Spinach? No!

04:57.090 --> 04:58.330
[all] Mint, mint!

04:58.330 --> 04:59.260
- Good job.
- Okay.

04:59.260 --> 05:00.860
Butter? Hopscotch?

05:00.860 --> 05:02.100
Butterscotch, butterscotch.

05:02.100 --> 05:03.930
Butterscotch chips!
Butterscotch chips!

05:03.930 --> 05:06.730
[laughs maniacally]

05:06.740 --> 05:10.270
"Find and taste the mille crepe.
Its flavor will hold your next clue."

05:10.270 --> 05:11.540
- Crepe, crepe, crepe.
- Where is it?

05:11.540 --> 05:14.210
- Look for a crepe.
- Mille. What is this?

05:14.210 --> 05:16.180
I have no idea
what a mille crepe is.

05:16.180 --> 05:19.350
- Look on the pastry thing.
- You gotta taste some of those things.

05:20.280 --> 05:21.750
[Marti] Girl,
that is not a crepe.

05:21.750 --> 05:23.120
[sighs wearily]

05:23.120 --> 05:24.050
It's these things, right?

05:24.050 --> 05:25.190
No, this one!

05:25.920 --> 05:27.890
- Lemon?
- No, pineapple!

05:27.890 --> 05:29.390
[shushes]

05:30.890 --> 05:32.230
[whispering] Quick,
quick, quick!

05:32.230 --> 05:34.530
Oh! Go to the chessboard
and quickly match. Let's go, y'all.

05:34.530 --> 05:36.000
Pineapple, pineapple!

05:36.000 --> 05:39.130
<i>[Peachez] The last clue.
Properly identify</i>

05:39.130 --> 05:41.700
- a bunch of different pastries.
- Baklava.

05:41.700 --> 05:43.540
- Tart...
- Creme brulee.

05:43.540 --> 05:47.540
Thank goodness that I spent all
that time watching those baking shows.

05:47.540 --> 05:51.080
- 'Cause this is a breeze, honey.
- That's this one.

05:51.080 --> 05:52.710
- Okay.
- Check, check!

05:52.720 --> 05:53.980
Check is clear!

05:53.980 --> 05:55.550
[team cheering]

05:55.550 --> 05:57.920
- Woo-hoo!
- Okay, we were just taking our time

05:57.920 --> 05:59.250
absorbing the flavor.

05:59.250 --> 06:02.390
- [cheering]
- The blue team wins!

06:02.390 --> 06:06.030
- Ooh, ooh, ooh! Go, blue team! Go, blue team!
- Yes!

06:06.030 --> 06:08.460
Great job, blue team.
Congratulations.

06:08.460 --> 06:12.730
To show us that you have what it
takes to roll with the upper crest,

06:12.740 --> 06:17.070
this week's skill-drill cook,
we will be making fruit tarts.

06:17.070 --> 06:18.670
- [Angie] Okay.
- [all exclaiming]

06:18.670 --> 06:22.140
And blue team, since you won the
scavenger hunt, you'll pick one recruit

06:22.140 --> 06:26.250
to throw a ball into these tea cups to
determine which advantage you'll receive.

06:26.250 --> 06:27.750
I'll go, coach.

06:27.750 --> 06:29.950
- [all laughing]
- Peachez, pinkies up.

06:29.950 --> 06:31.020
Here we go.

06:32.320 --> 06:35.590
- [Kara] Oh!
- Miss another one. Oh, good job.

06:35.590 --> 06:38.660
I feel like I've got perfect
form, and every time it just... Uh!

06:39.290 --> 06:41.560
- Okay. Okay...
- Uh!

06:42.460 --> 06:44.000
We're fine, we're fine.

06:46.300 --> 06:47.230
Hilda...

06:48.470 --> 06:50.870
Ooh! Don't look at me.

06:50.870 --> 06:52.940
- Come on, you can keep going.
- Keep going, keep going.

06:52.940 --> 06:54.810
- [Eddie] Ooh...
- [all cheering]

06:54.810 --> 06:57.180
Peachez, since you landed
in the chamomile tea,

06:57.180 --> 07:00.280
you'll be able to put
the red team in a one minute

07:00.280 --> 07:01.850
sleepy-time time out.

07:01.850 --> 07:03.280
- Are you kidding?
- No!

07:03.290 --> 07:07.420
They can't cook or prep
anything for one whole minute.

07:07.420 --> 07:09.020
- [hoarsely] Evil...
- Blue team, let's go.

07:09.020 --> 07:10.820
Red team, your queen awaits.

07:10.830 --> 07:12.460
Today, we're gonna work
on our tart game.

07:12.460 --> 07:16.060
I'm going to teach you how to
make a mango tart, coconut custard,

07:16.060 --> 07:17.960
- and a posh glaze.
- Yes!

07:17.970 --> 07:20.030
I'm going to show you guys
how to make

07:20.040 --> 07:25.140
a strawberry and raspberry fruit
tart with a Meyer lemon pastry cream.

07:25.140 --> 07:27.410
And a crispy little short dough.

07:29.910 --> 07:33.380
First and foremost, tart dough.
In the mixture, all-purpose flour.

07:33.380 --> 07:35.280
Confectionary sugar,
two sticks of butter.

07:35.280 --> 07:36.880
Does the temperature
on that matter?

07:36.890 --> 07:40.120
You want the butter to be room
temp. Because the cooler the butter,

07:40.120 --> 07:41.820
it's gonna keep
your dough tighter.

07:41.820 --> 07:44.160
Now, onto my board,
I want everything mixed.

07:44.160 --> 07:46.930
I don't really wanna work
the flour too much.

07:46.930 --> 07:48.560
So, now we're gonna wrap this.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.530
And this goes into your fridge
for 30 minutes.

07:50.530 --> 07:52.230
For our pastry cream,

07:52.230 --> 07:55.200
two cups of heavy cream.
One cup of sugar.

07:55.200 --> 07:59.210
Half goes in your cream, and
half goes in a bowl on the side.

07:59.210 --> 08:00.710
Vanilla extract.

08:00.710 --> 08:05.050
I am gonna flavor my pastry cream
with a little bit of Meyer lemons.

08:05.050 --> 08:10.120
- Bring to a boil. If you wanna use other citrus...
- What about citrus juice?

08:10.120 --> 08:14.450
Remember, we have dairy. So, citrus juice
could make the milk or the heavy cream

08:14.460 --> 08:18.430
curdle. We get most of the
flavor in the oils. from the peel.

08:18.430 --> 08:21.500
In your bowl with
the sugar, four eggs.

08:21.500 --> 08:26.200
We're gonna beat these up. Now, I need
to combine eggs and boiling heavy cream

08:26.200 --> 08:28.200
without making scrambled eggs.

08:28.200 --> 08:31.170
We do what's called
"tempering."

08:31.170 --> 08:34.710
The eggs have a temper? Uh,
you learn something new every day.

08:34.710 --> 08:37.880
[Anne] Half of my boiling
cream into my eggs.

08:37.880 --> 08:41.010
Whisk it up a little bit,
and then, immediately

08:41.020 --> 08:44.820
right into there. Whisk this
until we see this start to thicken.

08:44.820 --> 08:46.350
Our tart dough.

08:46.360 --> 08:50.160
I'm gonna cut everything into eighths.
I'm gonna press the dough into the mold.

08:50.160 --> 08:52.460
Add two pieces of paper.
I'm gonna fill them with rice.

08:52.460 --> 08:55.960
Now this, in your over.
325 degrees, 25 minutes.

08:55.960 --> 08:59.000
[Anne] Pastry cream.
We're gonna strain this.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.900
In case there was any little
curdles of eggs this strains that out.

09:02.910 --> 09:05.910
I'm just letting this chill.
Let's think about the fruit.

09:05.910 --> 09:11.110
So, raspberry. And my
strawberries, I'm just gonna slice.

09:11.110 --> 09:14.480
[Cliff] Gonna take this out.
We're gonna pull the tart bases off.

09:14.480 --> 09:17.220
I'm making whipped
cream. Beautiful.

09:17.220 --> 09:19.390
That's about
what I'm looking for, okay?

09:19.390 --> 09:22.120
[Cliff] The glaze. You're gonna
need three sheets of gelatin.

09:22.120 --> 09:23.890
Every one into the icy water.

09:23.890 --> 09:25.890
Sugar. Turn that on,
so I can melt that sugar.

09:25.890 --> 09:28.600
We're gonna need 20 grams
of lemon juice.

09:28.600 --> 09:31.060
The gelatin can go right in
there. Whisk everything together.

09:31.070 --> 09:32.370
Boom! Glaze.

09:32.370 --> 09:35.940
[Anne] Lay the pastry cream
into our tart shell.

09:35.940 --> 09:38.440
<i>And then,
let's start decorating.</i>

09:38.440 --> 09:41.070
[Cliff] So, how I'm going
to prep my mango.

09:41.080 --> 09:44.010
So, what I'm gonna do is roll the
mango to the same size as the tart.

09:44.010 --> 09:46.850
Look out. Oh, it's a rose.

09:46.850 --> 09:48.820
[Cliff] Gonna take my fruit.
The glaze.

09:48.820 --> 09:51.350
[Peachez] It's like lip gloss.
Mmm-hmm.

09:51.350 --> 09:53.890
- [Anne] Here you guys go.
- Oh, it's just so good.

09:53.890 --> 09:56.120
- Wow!
- [Bianca] Dang, that mango is good.

09:56.120 --> 09:57.120
[Peachez] Mmm-hmm...

09:57.130 --> 09:59.630
All right.
My rockin' red stars.

09:59.630 --> 10:04.230
- You have 60 minutes...
- to create your own fruit tart.

10:04.230 --> 10:06.530
[laughs] Okay.

10:06.540 --> 10:09.270
- Are you ready?
- [all] Yes.

10:09.270 --> 10:10.440
Why are we still sitting here?

10:10.440 --> 10:12.510
I call caramelized onions.

10:12.510 --> 10:14.370
[all] Go, go, go!

10:15.140 --> 10:16.910
Lovely mixer...

10:16.910 --> 10:18.480
- Hmm.
- [Eddie] These are heavy.

10:18.480 --> 10:21.080
- [Kara] Marti, move!
- [Peachez] There's a whole cord there.

10:21.080 --> 10:23.220
Yeah, let's not get taken out
trying to plug it in.

10:23.220 --> 10:24.380
- [electrical buzzing]
- [chuckles]

10:24.390 --> 10:27.450
Get your dough going.
Come on, come on, let's go.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.760
Let's go dough, dough, dough,
dough, dough, dough.

10:29.760 --> 10:31.890
Get in, kids.
We're going swimming.

10:31.890 --> 10:34.490
- Everyone in the pool. Let's go.
- Whoa! Not so fast...

10:34.500 --> 10:36.400
Oh, okay. Little slower
than that. Yeah.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.970
Love this hustle.
Go, go, go.

10:38.970 --> 10:41.070
Oh! No. Off, shush,
shush, shush.

10:41.070 --> 10:43.500
- Shush, shush. There's a big button that says it, okay.
- Off, off.

10:43.510 --> 10:45.440
[Marti] How do you get
the damn egg yolk out?

10:45.440 --> 10:46.870
Oh, my God.
Just break the yolk.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.170
All right, get out
of there, goop.

10:48.180 --> 10:50.980
You broke yolks
with someone else's arm!

10:50.980 --> 10:54.050
[screaming]
Get off my face!

10:54.050 --> 10:56.150
I know, I know!

10:56.150 --> 10:58.320
- Come on! I mean...
- All right, I'm just... [screams]

10:58.320 --> 11:00.020
- No, get out! Come back. Okay.
- Oh, [bleep].

11:00.020 --> 11:02.490
- That's good enough. Oh, God almighty...
- [exhales]

11:02.490 --> 11:04.920
- Focus, queen.
- You know what?

11:04.930 --> 11:07.630
[Cliff] Now get all that
incorporated. Everything together.

11:07.630 --> 11:09.360
Work that, girl. Work it.

11:09.360 --> 11:13.370
You know I'm gonna work it!
Ooh, I'm gonna work it real good!

11:13.370 --> 11:17.400
And get it formed into a disk, roll it
out a little bit, and get it in the fridge.

11:17.410 --> 11:20.470
Come on. Go, go, go, go.
You, Hilda. You need flour.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.940
- All right?
- Yes, ma'am.

11:21.940 --> 11:24.310
Anne's dough is a diva.

11:24.310 --> 11:27.010
Stop! Once you smeared once,
roll it back towards you.

11:27.020 --> 11:30.880
- Make it into a disc.
- You've gotta stroke it, you've gotta turn it around.

11:30.890 --> 11:33.820
You've gotta roll it up, roll
it out, make it look pretty.

11:33.820 --> 11:35.420
Come on, roll out.

11:35.420 --> 11:39.130
My dough is falling apart.
It's sticking to the rolling pin.

11:39.130 --> 11:42.030
Hilda, give it a little, tiny
dust of flour, get it in the fridge.

11:42.030 --> 11:45.430
I have a ton of flour. How much
flour do you want me to put down?

11:45.430 --> 11:47.330
- It's still sticking.
- Oh, my God.

11:47.340 --> 11:48.740
<i>[Hilda] I'm totally fried.</i>

11:48.740 --> 11:49.940
Oh, no. Oh, no.

11:49.940 --> 11:54.010
I do not have any time
to remake that dough.

11:54.010 --> 11:55.310
[Hilda] Ugh! [bleep]

12:00.720 --> 12:02.820
[Anne] There are
45 minutes left!

12:02.820 --> 12:06.250
<i>♪ Yeah, do you feel it now?
Let me show you how ♪</i>

12:06.250 --> 12:09.290
<i>♪ We're gonna pump it up
We're gonna say it loud ♪</i>

12:10.360 --> 12:13.190
Hilda, get it in the fridge.
Come on. Go, go, go.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.960
<i>[Hilda] It's looking
a little raggedy.</i>

12:14.960 --> 12:17.230
But I'm gonna make it work.

12:17.230 --> 12:18.530
Excuse me.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.400
[vocalizing]
Gonna beat my eggs.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.870
- Let's start to build that custard.
- Is that good, is that enough?

12:22.870 --> 12:25.110
Now, beat it hard!
Remember, we're mean tonight.

12:25.110 --> 12:27.310
[screaming] Ah! Come on,
I'm gonna beat you, eggs!

12:27.310 --> 12:28.810
Yes! Yes!

12:28.810 --> 12:29.810
[Peachez]
Come on, come on.

12:29.810 --> 12:33.950
Honey, today,
I am Mary Berry incarnate!

12:33.950 --> 12:35.320
I'm getting my milk
measured out.

12:35.320 --> 12:37.080
Split the bean!

12:37.090 --> 12:38.920
I am separating egg yolks.

12:38.920 --> 12:40.420
It's getting thick.

12:40.420 --> 12:41.790
I love pastry!

12:41.790 --> 12:43.990
I'm making
a peaches and cream tart.

12:43.990 --> 12:47.190
I finally get to use a peach
in the kitchen! Ooh, baby!

12:47.200 --> 12:50.360
Maybe I should take a little bit of water
out. Okay. Angie is struggling today.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.970
For my fruit tart, I'm gonna
do a Valentine's theme.

12:52.970 --> 12:56.270
Strawberries, some chocolate,
some lime.

12:56.270 --> 12:58.400
- Did you temper the--
- Not yet.

12:58.410 --> 13:00.340
Well then, how come
it's chilling already?

13:01.110 --> 13:02.040
Oh...

13:03.580 --> 13:05.810
Oh, shoot.
I messed up.

13:05.810 --> 13:08.350
I was supposed to do that,
and then put it in here, huh?

13:08.350 --> 13:11.950
Sometimes, Angie is really
on-point, and then other times...

13:11.950 --> 13:14.390
she seems like she wasn't
even at the demo.

13:14.390 --> 13:15.390
Okay, we're starting over.

13:15.390 --> 13:17.360
We are not dead yet.

13:17.360 --> 13:19.330
I need a flavor!

13:19.330 --> 13:22.900
For my tart filling, I'm going
with a lemon-flavored custard.

13:22.900 --> 13:24.230
Why doesn't this look okay?

13:24.230 --> 13:26.070
My milk looks separated!

13:26.700 --> 13:29.140
Something is just not right.

13:29.140 --> 13:30.300
Does that look right?

13:30.310 --> 13:32.010
This shouldn't be chunky.

13:32.010 --> 13:33.970
- No, what's in there?
- I put lemon in it.

13:34.510 --> 13:37.540
Yeah. Hmm...
See, Cheyenne.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.750
Diary and acid will curdle.

13:39.750 --> 13:41.150
Can't put acid. Okay.

13:41.150 --> 13:44.080
You didn't make pastry cream,
Cheyenne. You just made cheese.

13:44.090 --> 13:46.450
- We'll dump it.
- Okay. Grab another one.

13:46.450 --> 13:48.590
I start my custard mixture
over again.

13:48.590 --> 13:50.120
What can I flavor that with?

13:50.130 --> 13:54.230
- Once you temper it, you can add lemon zest. Yes.
- Zest? Okay, perfect.

13:54.230 --> 13:56.630
Oh... she's boiling.

13:56.630 --> 13:57.960
She's boiling.

13:57.970 --> 14:00.730
I'm making a Meyer
lemon tart with berries.

14:00.740 --> 14:02.870
- Are you ready to temper?
- I did the half in, and now I'm gonna put it in.

14:02.870 --> 14:05.770
- Like, immediately.
- Immediately, okay. Immediately, ooh, ooh, ooh.

14:05.770 --> 14:09.140
Whisk in a pan with a big whisk. Why
do you have, like, 14 whisks [chuckles]

14:09.140 --> 14:11.380
- that are tiny? I mean...
- I'm a whisk queen. It's whisking.

14:11.380 --> 14:13.380
I will whisk here, and I'll
whisk there, and I'll whisk here.

14:13.380 --> 14:15.150
Call me
"the Queen of the Whisk."

14:16.480 --> 14:18.820
I've done my arm work today.

14:18.820 --> 14:24.220
I have aged five years, at least, watching
Bianca try to cook this pastry cream.

14:25.060 --> 14:27.430
- Bianca? What are we doing?
- Yes?

14:27.900 --> 14:28.960
Whisking.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.460
Okay. Are we there?

14:30.470 --> 14:32.300
- [stammers] Is the butter in there?
- Yes.

14:32.300 --> 14:35.200
You know, I'm whisking my
arm away. It's getting tired.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.840
When is this going
to thicken up?

14:36.840 --> 14:39.170
- Stir.
<i>- [Bianca] My kids are gonna have children,</i>

14:39.170 --> 14:40.640
and I'm still here
whisking this.

14:40.640 --> 14:44.110
<i>Finally! Worst Bakers...
If you wanna call me, call me.</i>

14:44.110 --> 14:46.150
I'll be there.

14:46.150 --> 14:50.750
- Oh, look at you! Is there an inner pastry chef in you?
- Look at me! [chuckles]

14:50.750 --> 14:51.850
Maybe. [chuckles]

14:51.850 --> 14:55.090
I'm making a lime-infused
pastry cream

14:55.090 --> 14:57.420
<i>with kiwi, strawberries,
and bananas.</i>

14:57.430 --> 15:00.230
Wow, that actually looks
like custard! [laughs]

15:00.230 --> 15:03.730
- Al, you made custard!
- I made custard!

15:04.500 --> 15:05.300
Whoo-hoo!

15:05.300 --> 15:07.030
I'm actually impressed.

15:07.040 --> 15:10.040
- These go on a tart on top, or no?
- Walnuts?

15:10.040 --> 15:11.910
- You'd need to toast them, remember?
- Okay.

15:11.910 --> 15:14.970
<i>[Kara] My fruit tart is gonna be
inspired by banana cream pie,</i>

15:14.980 --> 15:17.280
because Eddie loves
banana cream pies.

15:17.850 --> 15:18.750
I love it.

15:18.750 --> 15:21.080
Mmm... Maple.
I love maple.

15:21.080 --> 15:24.220
I'm gonna top it with a maple
flavored whipped cream.

15:25.550 --> 15:26.750
Little more.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.020
Everyone! Ten minutes!

15:29.020 --> 15:30.520
- Peachez?
- [Peachez] Yes?

15:30.530 --> 15:32.160
- The one-minute advantage.
- Yep.

15:32.160 --> 15:34.290
It is time to enact
the advantage!

15:34.300 --> 15:36.060
- Red team, time out!
- [alarm beeps]

15:36.060 --> 15:38.100
Red team, back away
from the tart!

15:38.100 --> 15:40.000
[mimicking alarm]

15:40.000 --> 15:41.070
- I'm done. How you doin'?
- It's okay.

15:41.070 --> 15:43.340
Oh, my God, I'm already behind!

15:43.340 --> 15:46.870
Take these couple of seconds
to regroup and finish up strong.

15:46.880 --> 15:48.980
- Okay, ready? One, two three. We got this!
- [all] Rockin' red!

15:48.980 --> 15:50.510
[Marti] We got this,
we can do this.

15:50.510 --> 15:51.880
- Pour.
- [Marti] How much more time?

15:51.880 --> 15:52.850
[Anne] Thirty seconds.

15:52.850 --> 15:55.750
In bootcamp,
a minute is a lifetime.

15:55.750 --> 15:59.420
[all] Five, four, three,
two, one.

15:59.420 --> 16:00.550
- Go!
- [Anne] Time in.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.060
Oh, good. It didn't burn.

16:02.060 --> 16:03.860
Whoo-hoo, yes!

16:03.860 --> 16:08.490
I go and take my tart out of the
oven, and it's looking pretty pale.

16:09.600 --> 16:12.530
Like, she hasn't seen the sun
in a long time.

16:13.970 --> 16:15.500
A very long time.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.740
[Cliff] Get it out of the tart shell,
nice and easy. So, we can fill it.

16:17.740 --> 16:19.110
- Now!
- Phew.

16:19.110 --> 16:21.010
I can't start over.
There's no time.

16:21.010 --> 16:23.180
<i>I'm trying to figure out
a nice way</i>

16:23.180 --> 16:25.280
to get the tart out
without breaking it.

16:26.910 --> 16:27.980
[Eddie] Wow...

16:27.980 --> 16:30.180
[Cliff] Oh, Eddie...

16:30.190 --> 16:31.990
This is an absolute nightmare.

16:32.590 --> 16:33.550
[Eddie sighs]

16:38.190 --> 16:40.730
Five minutes, five minutes!

16:45.500 --> 16:47.000
[Eddie] How's that?

16:47.000 --> 16:48.800
So, my tart has
crumbled everywhere.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.940
But I've gotta get
something on my plate.

16:50.940 --> 16:53.270
Oh, it's... All the good
stuff is gonna be here.

16:53.270 --> 16:54.940
And that's what matters.

16:54.940 --> 16:59.350
This is my deconstructed
version of Chef Cliff's tart.

16:59.350 --> 17:01.150
- Don't look, Chef.
- Nice and beaut--

17:01.150 --> 17:03.450
Eddie! What did you do?

17:03.450 --> 17:04.720
It's all gonna be there.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.420
Big time mistake,
big time audible.

17:06.420 --> 17:08.220
There is no giving up here.

17:08.220 --> 17:10.890
[Angie] Oh, my God.
This is just like water.

17:10.890 --> 17:11.820
Make it look pretty.

17:11.830 --> 17:13.330
What's a good way
to put this on?

17:13.330 --> 17:14.730
- Just on?
- You're a Southern lady.

17:14.730 --> 17:16.400
Make it look like
a Southern pie.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.830
All right, my little banana
pageant queen.

17:18.830 --> 17:20.830
[Marti] Oh, it's so pretty.
It's so pretty. It's so pretty.

17:20.840 --> 17:22.870
I feel like Leonardo da Vinci.

17:22.870 --> 17:26.310
This tart looks like she <i>belongs
next to the Mona Lisa in the Louvre.</i>

17:26.310 --> 17:29.310
Fifty seconds everyone.
We got this, Blue Team!

17:29.310 --> 17:31.680
Go, go, go, go, go! Oh!

17:31.680 --> 17:33.650
- Come on, Kara. Come on, Kara.
- [Kara] I know.

17:33.650 --> 17:36.450
- [Cheyenne] Keep it simple.
- [Cliff] Whipped cream, whipped cream, whipped cream.

17:36.450 --> 17:37.520
Come on, zest!

17:37.520 --> 17:38.550
[Anne] Five!

17:38.550 --> 17:39.490
[Anne and Cliff] Four...

17:39.920 --> 17:40.890
three...

17:40.890 --> 17:42.020
two...

17:42.020 --> 17:43.720
- one!
- [Anne] That's it. Hands up.

17:43.730 --> 17:44.720
You are done.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.190
[laughing, indistinct chatter]

17:46.190 --> 17:47.130
Holy crap!

17:47.130 --> 17:50.200
Queen of tarts happening
over here today.

17:50.200 --> 17:51.130
[Cliff] Let's see how we did.

17:51.130 --> 17:53.470
- Cheyenne?
- [Peachez] Go get 'em, Chey!

17:53.470 --> 17:56.070
[Cheyenne] My tart is a strawberry
lemon with whipped cream.

17:56.070 --> 17:57.470
[Cliff] How did you feel
about the challenge?

17:57.470 --> 18:02.080
This challenge was so easy
until I made cheese.

18:02.080 --> 18:05.110
[both laughing]

18:05.110 --> 18:07.180
[Cheyenne]
So, I had to start all over.

18:07.180 --> 18:09.280
- The pastry cream is delicious.
- Thank you.

18:09.280 --> 18:11.880
All in all,
for your very first tart,

18:11.890 --> 18:12.550
it's fantastic.

18:12.550 --> 18:13.890
Thank you.

18:13.890 --> 18:15.220
Peachez, join me with your tart.

18:15.220 --> 18:17.320
<i>Bonjour!</i>

18:17.330 --> 18:22.030
- This is a peaches and cream tart.
- [Cliff chuckles]

18:22.030 --> 18:25.830
Fresh peaches and
hand-whipped whipped cream.

18:25.830 --> 18:27.500
And by hand-whipped, I mean,

18:27.500 --> 18:29.600
my good friend
the mixer made it.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.240
[Cliff laughs]

18:32.040 --> 18:33.040
It's good.

18:33.040 --> 18:34.710
I love the fresh peach.

18:34.710 --> 18:36.510
It's a really, really
well-built tart.

18:36.510 --> 18:37.710
[screams]

18:37.710 --> 18:38.510
Eddie?

18:38.510 --> 18:40.050
[Peachez]
All right, Eddie.

18:40.050 --> 18:42.250
Eddie, what do we have here?
It's like a deconstructed tart.

18:42.250 --> 18:44.180
Yes, it's very deconstructed.

18:44.190 --> 18:46.720
Filling has vanilla bean
with coconut milk.

18:46.720 --> 18:47.950
[Cliff] Let's talk
about the crust.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.220
That one piece...

18:49.220 --> 18:51.990
I just ate completely
disintegrated in my mouth.

18:51.990 --> 18:53.490
Total disaster.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.490
I'm bamboozled.

18:54.500 --> 18:55.930
You didn't have enough butter.

18:55.930 --> 18:58.630
I'm disappointed because
obviously the tart is a miss.

18:58.630 --> 18:59.730
It's very disappointing.

18:59.730 --> 19:00.870
Bianca.

19:00.870 --> 19:03.070
I made a pina colada tart.

19:03.070 --> 19:04.870
I wanted to use fresh pineapple.

19:04.870 --> 19:06.140
Time was very limited.

19:06.140 --> 19:08.070
- So you used canned pineapple?
- Yes.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.240
I do enjoy the pastry cream,
pineapple and the coconut.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.110
I wish the pineapple
popped more.

19:12.110 --> 19:15.050
If you'd used fresh pineapple,
it's gonna bring you the most flavor.

19:15.050 --> 19:17.420
- But you baked a beautiful tart.
- Thank you.

19:17.420 --> 19:19.720
I am ready for some tarts.

19:19.720 --> 19:21.050
Marti, you're up first.

19:21.060 --> 19:21.920
Let's go!

19:21.920 --> 19:24.390
Talk to me about what you made.

19:24.390 --> 19:26.960
I used raspberries,
blackberries, strawberries,

19:26.960 --> 19:29.000
a little mint just
to make it pretty.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.860
The pastry cream
tastes beautiful.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.300
Your dough is a hair
undercooked.

19:33.300 --> 19:36.140
But everything else
is really lovely.

19:36.140 --> 19:37.470
-Awesome
-[Angie] Good job, Marti.

19:37.470 --> 19:38.340
[clapping]

19:38.340 --> 19:39.840
Kara, come on up.

19:39.840 --> 19:42.310
I wanted us to have a
little banana pudding.

19:42.310 --> 19:46.010
I made my custard with the
Meyer lemon, some bananas,

19:46.010 --> 19:49.780
and a maple whipped cream
with roasted walnuts.

19:49.780 --> 19:52.120
And a dash of cinnamon on top.

19:52.120 --> 19:55.490
Your tart might have been
tiny bit overfilled.

19:55.490 --> 19:58.090
But it's overfilled
with deliciousness.

19:58.090 --> 20:00.260
The bananas, the nuts,
the cinnamon.

20:00.260 --> 20:01.690
All works together.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.060
Excellent job, Kara.

20:03.060 --> 20:04.560
All right, Hilda.

20:04.570 --> 20:07.430
[Hilda] I made a orange
and mint tart.

20:07.440 --> 20:10.400
With blackberry
and raspberry on top.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.470
That's a minty fresh
pastry cream.

20:14.170 --> 20:17.640
The mint does kind of give
the pastry cream a funky color,

20:17.650 --> 20:20.210
and it's a bit
on the sweet side.

20:20.220 --> 20:23.150
But the cream itself
is whipped beautifully.

20:23.150 --> 20:24.420
Thank you, Chef Anne.

20:24.420 --> 20:25.990
Big Al.

20:25.990 --> 20:28.850
[Al] You have
a lime-infused pastry.

20:28.860 --> 20:30.090
Sliced up some bananas.

20:30.090 --> 20:34.030
[Anne] And we have strawberry,
kiwi and a single raspberry.

20:34.030 --> 20:35.430
Honestly didn't know what
to do with the Cool Whip.

20:35.430 --> 20:36.460
The Cool Whip. [chuckles]

20:36.460 --> 20:38.300
- Whipped cream.
- Or whipped cream.

20:38.300 --> 20:41.000
Your pastry cream is
a hair on the thin side,

20:41.000 --> 20:42.300
but I like the lime zest a lot.

20:42.300 --> 20:45.100
You have nice knife cuts
on your bananas.

20:45.110 --> 20:48.870
But I feel like your strawberries
could have been little bit more uniform.

20:48.880 --> 20:50.410
Really, Chef Anne?

20:50.410 --> 20:53.180
Do you insult like
Michelangelo? Or da Vinci?

20:53.180 --> 20:55.480
That tart is art!

20:55.480 --> 20:57.420
I'm not an artsy guy,
but I try it.

20:57.850 --> 20:58.950
Ang, come on up.

20:58.950 --> 21:01.090
[Angie] The tart
is infused with lime.

21:01.090 --> 21:03.190
Some white chocolate,
some dark chocolate shavings

21:03.190 --> 21:05.790
with raspberry, kiwi
and strawberries.

21:05.790 --> 21:07.860
The dark chocolate,
appearance wise--

21:07.860 --> 21:09.600
- [Angie] It's like coffee rinds, right?
- [Anne] Right?

21:09.600 --> 21:13.130
- Our pastry cream is not even thickening up at all.
- No. No, it's not.

21:14.600 --> 21:15.700
I can see.

21:15.700 --> 21:17.240
There are some weeks
when you do it

21:17.240 --> 21:19.940
Some weeks when you don't and
you gotta do it every week.

21:19.940 --> 21:21.370
- Yes.
- Because you can!

21:21.380 --> 21:22.410
- [Anne] All right?
- Yes.

21:23.180 --> 21:24.910
There was one dish...

21:24.910 --> 21:26.380
That was really off the tarts.

21:27.280 --> 21:28.280
[crickets chirping]

21:28.280 --> 21:29.520
So, the winner is...

21:31.590 --> 21:32.520
Cheyenne.

21:33.120 --> 21:34.920
Shut up!

21:34.920 --> 21:36.590
<i>[Cheyenne] I won. I won.</i>

21:37.120 --> 21:38.160
Strawberries

21:38.160 --> 21:39.330
and lemon.

21:39.330 --> 21:40.960
- You surprised yourself.
- I sure did.

21:40.960 --> 21:42.330
- It's an excellent tart.
- Thank you.

21:42.330 --> 21:45.030
There was one rocking red star

21:45.030 --> 21:46.500
who was absolutely

21:46.500 --> 21:48.530
exceptional today...

21:49.300 --> 21:50.300
Kara.

21:50.540 --> 21:51.600
Seriously?

21:51.610 --> 21:52.970
Great flavor.

21:52.970 --> 21:55.210
- Really good job.
- Thank you so much, Chef Anne.

21:55.380 --> 21:56.340
Remember,

21:56.340 --> 21:58.280
this is an elimination week,

21:58.280 --> 21:59.580
for the main dish challenge

21:59.580 --> 22:02.350
and things
are going to get saucy.

22:02.350 --> 22:04.150
[Cliff] Anne and I
will each show you

22:04.150 --> 22:05.750
how to make ricotta gnocchi

22:05.750 --> 22:08.150
and a hearty
Italian sauce to boot.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.060
All right.

22:09.060 --> 22:10.560
[Anne] My rocking red stars.

22:10.560 --> 22:12.430
Today, I'm going
to show you guys

22:12.430 --> 22:15.030
how to make ricotta gnocchi

22:15.030 --> 22:18.030
<i>with a guanciale, onion</i>

22:18.030 --> 22:20.200
<i>and tomato-mushroom sauce.</i>

22:20.200 --> 22:21.630
[Hilda] That's a lot.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.070
Today, I'm gonna
teach how to make

22:23.070 --> 22:24.070
ricotta gnocchi

22:24.070 --> 22:25.540
with mushroom cream sauce.

22:25.540 --> 22:27.210
I hate mushrooms so much.

22:27.210 --> 22:28.910
They grow in poop.

22:28.910 --> 22:30.980
<i>Ugh. If I had to cook
with mushrooms today,</i>

22:30.980 --> 22:32.480
count me out.

22:32.480 --> 22:34.750
Actually, it says here
that mushrooms

22:34.750 --> 22:37.450
typically grow in dead wood
and leaf litter.

22:37.450 --> 22:38.480
So remember, kids,

22:38.490 --> 22:40.150
never listen to Peachez.

22:40.150 --> 22:41.420
Okay, I missed that one.

22:41.420 --> 22:43.720
Gnocchi is the word
for dumpling.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.360
There's lots
of different kinds of gnocchi.

22:45.360 --> 22:46.830
Most commonly,

22:46.830 --> 22:48.160
made out of potatoes.

22:48.160 --> 22:51.260
Ricotta gnocchi, these are
mostly made out of cheese.

22:51.270 --> 22:52.370
[Cliff] First thing I'm gonna do

22:52.370 --> 22:53.500
we're gonna build sauce in here.

22:53.500 --> 22:54.770
The mushrooms we'll be using...

22:54.770 --> 22:56.140
I'm using oyster mushrooms.

22:56.140 --> 22:58.770
And I'm using Maitake,
or hen-of-the-woods mushrooms.

22:58.770 --> 23:00.070
Little olive oil.

23:00.070 --> 23:01.940
So I want my mushrooms
to brown a little bit.

23:01.940 --> 23:04.310
All right, I'm going to get
my sauce going.

23:04.310 --> 23:06.250
Starting with cremini mushrooms.

23:06.250 --> 23:07.710
I love mushrooms.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.280
I don't like
the big portobellos.

23:09.280 --> 23:10.680
It's like eating an alien skin.

23:13.250 --> 23:14.990
[Anne] Now, my guanciale.

23:14.990 --> 23:18.720
Guanciale is cured pork jowl,

23:18.730 --> 23:19.930
the cheek.

23:19.930 --> 23:20.960
Cut it into julienne.

23:20.960 --> 23:22.960
What did you call that,
Julianne?

23:22.960 --> 23:25.060
Juli-enne, skinny slices.

23:25.070 --> 23:27.130
Julianne? Who's that?

23:27.140 --> 23:28.930
Are they bringing
a new recruit in?

23:28.940 --> 23:30.570
[Anne] Once my mushrooms
are brown,

23:30.570 --> 23:32.270
I'm gonna take them
out of my pan.

23:32.270 --> 23:34.540
Guanciale, low heat.

23:34.540 --> 23:36.040
[Cliff] I'm gonna lightly
season my mushrooms

23:36.040 --> 23:37.480
with a little bit of salt.

23:37.480 --> 23:38.810
Add some chopped
shallots to this.

23:38.810 --> 23:40.380
Adding my thyme, garlic.

23:40.380 --> 23:42.380
I'm gonna add
about a cup of cream.

23:42.380 --> 23:44.480
The sauce,
just like that, right.

23:44.490 --> 23:47.120
[Anne] So, my guanc...
It looks crispy

23:47.120 --> 23:48.720
and nice and golden.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.320
So, I'm gonna take it out

23:50.320 --> 23:52.160
and I'm gonna cook my onions

23:52.160 --> 23:53.890
in the guanciale fat.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.160
Nice sprinkle of salt.

23:55.160 --> 23:57.160
A pinch of crushed red pepper.

23:57.170 --> 23:59.100
Then add the tomatoes to it.

23:59.100 --> 24:01.300
I'm gonna get
everyone stirred together.

24:01.300 --> 24:02.940
You guys, come taste the sauce

24:02.940 --> 24:04.540
and I want to tell me
what you feel like, it tastes.

24:04.540 --> 24:06.310
- Tomatoey.
- Tomatoey.

24:06.310 --> 24:08.410
It tastes like,
just tomatoes, right?

24:08.410 --> 24:09.840
It's not exciting.

24:09.840 --> 24:11.580
A little sprinkle of salt.

24:11.580 --> 24:14.010
All right.
So, try this again.

24:14.410 --> 24:15.550
Oh, wow.

24:15.550 --> 24:16.880
My, how she's changed, right?

24:16.880 --> 24:17.820
Yeah.

24:17.820 --> 24:19.320
I get more of the guanciale,

24:19.320 --> 24:22.860
I get the onion,
I get more spicy, right?

24:22.860 --> 24:24.460
Now going to make
the gnocchi dough.

24:24.460 --> 24:26.360
The stand mixer,
my ricotta cheese,

24:26.360 --> 24:28.090
parmesan cheese,
three egg yolks.

24:28.100 --> 24:29.330
We're not gonna
be using the whites.

24:29.330 --> 24:31.360
Salt, now I'm gonna
start adding my flour.

24:31.370 --> 24:33.270
I just want it to come together.

24:33.270 --> 24:35.000
I don't want
to overwork the flour.

24:35.000 --> 24:35.900
Feel it.

24:35.900 --> 24:37.270
If I keep mixing it,

24:37.270 --> 24:40.270
you're really gonna activate
the gluten in the flour

24:40.270 --> 24:43.110
instead of that gnocchi
being pillowy,

24:43.110 --> 24:45.080
it's gonna become really tough.

24:45.080 --> 24:47.980
[Anne] Now, we get our dough
to a nice consistency.

24:47.980 --> 24:50.120
Just kind of
kneading it a little bit.

24:50.120 --> 24:51.150
I wanna make sure

24:51.150 --> 24:53.320
that I'm not feeling
any super sticky parts.

24:53.320 --> 24:55.620
- It's more like Play-Doh.
- Yeah. Exactly.

24:55.620 --> 24:58.520
Keep it in,
sort of a log like this.

24:58.530 --> 24:59.730
Make some pieces

24:59.730 --> 25:01.390
and we're gonna make snakes.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.300
So then, when you have
your snakes,

25:05.070 --> 25:06.700
gentle with these guys,
all right.

25:06.700 --> 25:10.070
Then you really wanna get them
all tossed in with flour.

25:10.070 --> 25:12.200
[Cliff] Pinch, cut, pinch cut.

25:12.870 --> 25:15.170
Gnocchi set and ready to go.

25:15.180 --> 25:17.110
So I am gonna season
my pasta water.

25:17.110 --> 25:18.510
So a little bit of salt.

25:19.210 --> 25:20.880
About a half gallon, Chef Cliff?

25:20.880 --> 25:22.310
- [Peachez chuckles]
- [mimics puking]

25:22.320 --> 25:24.420
[Anne] Once our water
is at a boil,

25:24.420 --> 25:26.220
you're gonna drop our gnocchi.

25:26.220 --> 25:29.460
When you cook gnocchi,
they're ready when they float.

25:29.460 --> 25:30.460
At this point,

25:30.460 --> 25:33.130
I'm gonna add my mushrooms
back to my sauce.

25:33.130 --> 25:34.790
[Cliff] Now, I'm gonna finish
cooking the gnocchi

25:34.800 --> 25:35.730
in this sauce.

25:35.730 --> 25:37.130
Look at these
little pillows of love.

25:37.130 --> 25:39.430
I'm gonna drop them.
Boo, boo, boo.

25:39.430 --> 25:41.570
- Right in here.
- Do we need to reduce it at all?

25:41.570 --> 25:43.940
[Cliff] Yes. So now, the thing
about cream sauces

25:43.940 --> 25:45.340
you don't want it
to be like glue.

25:45.340 --> 25:47.170
If I over-reduce my cream,
what can I do?

25:47.170 --> 25:48.970
- Add some pasta water.
- Add some milk.

25:48.980 --> 25:51.010
Yes. So, I can take
over this gnocchi water.

25:51.010 --> 25:53.210
[Anne] Look at how they've
gotten kind of nice and puffy.

25:53.210 --> 25:54.850
Right into our sauce.

25:54.850 --> 25:57.280
A little bit more spice, cheese.

25:57.290 --> 25:58.350
So what do I need to do to this?

25:58.350 --> 25:59.620
Season it, taste it.

26:00.090 --> 26:01.120
Taste it!

26:03.190 --> 26:04.160
Those are delicious.

26:04.160 --> 26:05.960
All I'm gonna do now is plate.

26:06.330 --> 26:07.490
I'm ready to taste.

26:07.500 --> 26:10.130
[Anne] Little pile of gnocchi
all right in the center.

26:10.130 --> 26:13.400
I'm gonna finish with another
little sprinkle of cheese,

26:13.400 --> 26:15.870
guanciale and my chives.

26:15.870 --> 26:16.870
Beautiful.

26:16.870 --> 26:18.040
- [Anne] Ready to try it?
- [all] Yes.

26:18.940 --> 26:20.540
- Ooh.
- [Cliff] Come to me.

26:20.540 --> 26:22.840
- [Cheyenne] That looks so pretty.
- Oh, yummy.

26:22.840 --> 26:25.310
Mmm. Mmm, mmm,
mmm, mmm.

26:25.310 --> 26:27.950
- This is really good.
- It's really soft.

26:27.950 --> 26:29.150
I usually hate mushrooms,

26:29.150 --> 26:31.350
but I like
this kind of mushroom.

26:31.350 --> 26:33.420
- It's awesome.
- Questions, anyone?

26:33.420 --> 26:34.490
Can I have more?

26:34.490 --> 26:35.620
[all laughing]

26:36.220 --> 26:37.260
So, recruits,

26:37.260 --> 26:39.190
for this challenge
you'll have 60 minutes

26:39.190 --> 26:40.960
to replicate my gnocchi dough.

26:40.960 --> 26:44.100
And put your own flavor spin
on a sauce.

26:44.100 --> 26:45.200
[Cliff] Your time starts now.

26:45.200 --> 26:46.130
[Cheyenne] Let's go.

26:46.130 --> 26:47.170
[Marti laughing] Go!

26:48.700 --> 26:49.800
[Bianca] These are heavy.

26:49.800 --> 26:51.200
[mimicking trumpet]

26:51.210 --> 26:53.340
[Eddie] How art thou
this fine day?

26:53.340 --> 26:55.640
[Peachez] A lovely day
at the market.

26:57.210 --> 26:58.380
Oh, my God.

26:58.380 --> 27:00.180
I would taste that water
if I were you, Hilda.

27:01.180 --> 27:02.720
It is salty, ugh.

27:02.720 --> 27:03.980
Caught me on that one.

27:03.990 --> 27:06.190
- No, go dump half of it out.
- Got it.

27:06.190 --> 27:09.190
My inspiration
for the sauce is Italy.

27:09.190 --> 27:12.420
Tomatoes,
Italian sausage and basil.

27:12.430 --> 27:13.830
What's happening
with these onions?

27:13.830 --> 27:16.330
I'm gonna sweat the onions
with the garlic

27:16.330 --> 27:18.330
- with a little bit of butter.
- Why butter?

27:18.330 --> 27:20.370
Everything tastes good
with butter.

27:20.370 --> 27:21.830
But we're in Italy,
use olive oil.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.340
Olive oil.

27:23.340 --> 27:26.470
I want my sauce
to transport Chef Anne

27:26.470 --> 27:27.910
so she feels like

27:27.910 --> 27:30.910
she's on a gondola in...
in Venice.

27:30.910 --> 27:33.180
I just want everything
to be good for you.

27:34.650 --> 27:36.120
Oh, hell no.

27:36.120 --> 27:37.280
Okay.

27:37.280 --> 27:39.950
Chef Anne's gonna do
this trip by herself.

27:39.950 --> 27:42.290
[Anne] Hilda, you're done
with your bowl where does it go?

27:42.290 --> 27:44.220
[Hilda] I don't want her
breathing down my neck going,

27:44.230 --> 27:45.390
"Hilda!"

27:45.390 --> 27:47.460
[Anne] Hilda, can you put
busse chop next to you?

27:47.460 --> 27:48.490
Hilda.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.200
Hilda, I need to see you
run, run, run.

27:50.200 --> 27:51.330
- Yes, ma'am.
- Hilda.

27:52.030 --> 27:53.500
Hilda. Hilda.

27:53.500 --> 27:55.300
Knife cuts are really
important remember.

27:55.300 --> 27:56.400
[Hilda] Yes, ma'am.

27:56.400 --> 27:58.140
Hilda, you only need
one saute pan.

27:58.140 --> 28:00.470
Hilda, just slice
the casing with the knife.

28:00.470 --> 28:02.370
Oh, my God.

28:02.380 --> 28:04.740
Hilda, when we cut protein
can you do it on the gel board.

28:04.750 --> 28:07.110
She's always there.

28:07.110 --> 28:08.910
- She's everywhere.
- Hilda.

28:08.920 --> 28:10.220
Hilda. Hilda.

28:10.220 --> 28:11.450
She's scaring me.

28:11.450 --> 28:13.190
- Hilda.
- Creepers.

28:14.290 --> 28:15.350
[Anne] Hilda.

28:19.190 --> 28:20.630
[Bianca] Forty-five minutes.

28:26.070 --> 28:28.030
Do not overcook these guys.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.400
So for my sauce I'm thinking

28:29.400 --> 28:30.940
a fresh summery spice vibe.

28:30.940 --> 28:32.600
What are you doing?

28:32.610 --> 28:35.070
Peppers, shrimp, artichoke.

28:35.080 --> 28:36.540
<i>I love artichoke.</i>

28:36.540 --> 28:38.980
And it's an already
cooked vegetable, I think.

28:38.980 --> 28:40.250
It's a vegetable, right?

28:40.250 --> 28:42.250
Making a little spicy.
I like spicy food.

28:42.250 --> 28:43.520
Spicy? Okay.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.220
[imitates sizzle]

28:45.220 --> 28:46.250
Hey, what you doing?

28:46.950 --> 28:48.090
Cooking.

28:48.090 --> 28:49.990
[chuckles] Congratulations.

28:49.990 --> 28:51.920
My grandmother's mother

28:51.930 --> 28:53.560
is an immigrant from Italy.

28:53.560 --> 28:55.460
<i>So, I'm really excited
to make gnocchi.</i>

28:55.460 --> 28:56.560
One cup.

28:58.470 --> 28:59.400
[Italian accent] Spaghetti.

28:59.400 --> 29:00.700
Meatball.

29:01.530 --> 29:03.500
<i>♪ Cooking pancetta in a pan ♪</i>

29:03.500 --> 29:05.240
<i>For flavors I'm thinking</i>

29:05.240 --> 29:07.070
<i>garlic and shallot</i>

29:07.070 --> 29:09.580
<i>with oregano and some pancetta.</i>

29:09.580 --> 29:12.080
Okay, so we wanna render
this pancetta out, right?

29:12.080 --> 29:14.180
To get it now crispy and get
all the fat to come out of it.

29:14.180 --> 29:15.350
You can turn
the heat up with that.

29:15.350 --> 29:16.950
I'm afraid
of the pancetta sticking.

29:16.950 --> 29:18.580
I can add a little olive oil
to that pan.

29:18.590 --> 29:19.520
[Cheyenne] Should I?

29:21.450 --> 29:22.960
I should

29:22.960 --> 29:24.960
because when you say
things like that,

29:24.960 --> 29:26.130
that's what you mean.

29:26.130 --> 29:27.860
[Cliff] It's never a suggestion.

Sticking.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.540
- [Eddie] All right.
- [Bianca] I like it.

29:39.410 --> 29:41.240

pretty darn good.

29:41.240 --> 29:42.440
Oh, shush, no bragging.

29:42.440 --> 29:44.680
[Anne] Look at you,
Al, rolling gnocchi.

29:45.380 --> 29:47.050
<i>Al seems to be moving along</i>

29:47.050 --> 29:48.750

29:48.750 --> 29:51.080

a really fun time doing it.

29:51.090 --> 29:53.020
[Al laughing]

29:53.020 --> 29:55.290
[Al] Lots of flour
for this project.

29:55.290 --> 29:57.120
[laughing]

29:57.960 --> 29:59.390
All right.

30:00.730 --> 30:03.000
Actually, I don't know,
they don't look too bad.

30:03.000 --> 30:03.900
I nailed it.

30:03.900 --> 30:06.330
The crowd goes wild.

30:06.330 --> 30:08.230
[Eddie] It feels like opening
a new can of Play-Doh

30:08.240 --> 30:09.330
with my nephew.

30:09.340 --> 30:12.000
The closest I've come
to making homemade pasta

30:12.010 --> 30:13.910
is opening the cardboard box.

30:13.910 --> 30:15.410
Pinch it, cut it.

30:16.580 --> 30:19.880
For my sauce, I've put
some shrimp in the pan.

30:19.880 --> 30:21.950
Those shrimp cook like that.

30:21.950 --> 30:23.080
- [Eddie] Really fast.
- [Cliff] Okay?

30:23.080 --> 30:24.180
Those shrimp
are gonna be overcooked

30:24.190 --> 30:25.420
by the time you do
anything else.

30:25.420 --> 30:26.990
So I need to get these
shrimp out of here.

30:26.990 --> 30:29.220
<i>So I picked out every shrimp
and put it back in the bowl</i>

30:29.220 --> 30:32.190
and I think I saved them
just in the nick of time.

30:32.190 --> 30:34.690
You learn from your mistakes.
And I make a lot of mistakes.

30:34.700 --> 30:36.700
- No, you don't.
- And I'm gonna get better.

30:36.700 --> 30:38.230
Eddie are you getting better
by talking to Peachez

30:38.230 --> 30:39.730
and not concentrating
on what you're doing?

30:39.730 --> 30:41.100
Peachez typically relaxes me.

30:41.100 --> 30:42.430
Kara, you have
now been replaced.

30:42.440 --> 30:46.100
- By Peachez.
- Thank God, I was worried.

30:46.110 --> 30:48.710
Kara, you got a new
adopted baby.

30:48.710 --> 30:49.940
You're my baby?

30:49.940 --> 30:51.710
-I think Peachez is exactly,
-Brrr...

the kind of child
I would love to have.

30:55.920 --> 30:57.380
I'm coming home with you.

30:57.380 --> 30:58.280
That's exciting.

30:58.290 --> 30:59.450
Um...

31:00.150 --> 31:01.120
Kara, you're doing okay?

31:01.120 --> 31:02.860
I don't wanna throw you off.

31:02.860 --> 31:05.020
I'm about to drop
the gnocchi here a little bit.

31:05.030 --> 31:06.360
Coming into bootcamp,

31:06.360 --> 31:08.690
you couldn't pay me to touch
a pot of boiling water.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.100
Okay. Ooh...

31:10.100 --> 31:11.800
The water's
not gonna come up at you.

31:11.800 --> 31:13.300
- Okay.
- That's not gonna happen.

31:13.300 --> 31:14.670
- It's not gonna jump out of there.
- Okay.

31:15.070 --> 31:16.130
And now...

31:16.370 --> 31:17.700
[drumroll]

31:21.040 --> 31:22.570
<i>Nope.</i>

31:22.580 --> 31:24.510
It still sucks.

31:24.510 --> 31:25.940
Just get it in there, Kara.

31:25.950 --> 31:27.680
Use your bench scrape
and just like,

31:27.680 --> 31:30.150
commit to it and get
those gnocchi in the water.

31:30.150 --> 31:32.620
Why do I have to keep working
with hot water? This is crazy.

31:33.250 --> 31:35.020
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.
- There you go.

31:35.020 --> 31:37.190
- That's easier, isn't it?
- Thank you, Chef.

31:37.190 --> 31:39.090
I don't like it. But...

31:39.090 --> 31:40.390
I'm learning to live with it.

31:41.460 --> 31:44.000
Marti, can you not use
a fish spatula

31:44.000 --> 31:45.230
to stir sauce.

31:46.200 --> 31:48.170
[chuckles] Yeah, sorry.

31:52.740 --> 31:55.540
<i>[Marti] My sauce is pulling me
all over the place.</i>

31:55.540 --> 31:58.980

I'm salting, I'm tasting.

31:58.980 --> 32:01.050
<i>Try it again.
It's not salty enough.</i>

32:01.050 --> 32:02.180
I add more salt.

32:04.080 --> 32:05.020
Ugh.

32:05.020 --> 32:06.750
I'm tasting it, too much salt.

32:06.750 --> 32:07.790
I'm think I'm
on a teeter totter.

32:07.790 --> 32:09.120
We're up and we're down

32:09.120 --> 32:10.790
and we're up and we're down
and we're up and we're down.

32:10.790 --> 32:11.890
Better.

32:11.890 --> 32:13.590
[Cliff] Bianca, let's get
that meat in the pan.

32:13.590 --> 32:14.530
<i>[Bianca] Andale, andale.</i>

32:14.530 --> 32:15.860
As soon as Chef Cliff says,

32:15.860 --> 32:17.360
"We do our own sauce,"

32:17.360 --> 32:20.030
I automatically think
about vodka sauce.

32:20.030 --> 32:21.530
<i>That's what Hector orders
in restaurants.</i>

32:21.540 --> 32:23.000
<i>It looks really fancy.</i>

32:23.000 --> 32:25.070
- Is that pan even on?
- On very low heat.

32:25.070 --> 32:26.570
What can I cook
at very low heat?

32:26.570 --> 32:28.340
[clock ticking]

32:28.340 --> 32:30.210
Like, I don't do pop quizzes.

32:32.310 --> 32:33.310
Nothing!

32:33.380 --> 32:36.320
Trick question. You're looking
to break that up.

32:36.320 --> 32:38.220
Not roll it around
like little tiny meatballs.

32:38.990 --> 32:39.920

32:39.920 --> 32:41.250
[Cliff] Okay, I can't.

32:41.260 --> 32:42.620
It's like a little jack-hammer.

32:45.730 --> 32:47.060
Oh, hell no.

32:47.060 --> 32:48.530
So, you need
to get vodka in here.

32:48.530 --> 32:50.560
You need to deglaze
all of that good stuff out.

32:50.560 --> 32:52.500
I've seen it before,
you know, flambe.

32:52.500 --> 32:55.170
The alcohol needs to cook
and reduce.

32:56.500 --> 32:57.540

Thank you so much.

33:23.300 --> 33:24.560
Calm down, people.

33:34.870 --> 33:37.240
We're gonna get saucy!

33:37.240 --> 33:38.180
Dearly beloved,

33:38.180 --> 33:40.210
<i>we've gathered here
today to marry</i>

33:40.210 --> 33:42.310
this gnocchi
with this tomato sauce.

33:42.320 --> 33:44.150
Kara, little bit more glue.

33:44.150 --> 33:46.020
You want that marriage
to last, huh?

33:46.020 --> 33:47.420
Oh, absolutely.

33:47.420 --> 33:48.890
By the power vested in me,

33:48.890 --> 33:50.020
you are pasta.

33:50.020 --> 33:51.890
Eddie, you have those
shrimp back in there?

33:51.890 --> 33:53.490
- Yes, they are in there.
- Oh, okay.

33:53.490 --> 33:55.130
[Eddie] Actually, I should
probably taste one.

33:56.230 --> 33:57.430
This shrimp is overcooked.

33:57.430 --> 33:59.330
I don't really like
the shrimp in it.

33:59.330 --> 34:01.400
I'm gonna have to take
the shrimp back out again.

34:01.400 --> 34:03.700
<i>I can't give that to Chef Cliff.</i>

34:03.700 --> 34:06.300
I just put the shrimp in for
a light seafood flavoring.

34:06.310 --> 34:08.140
[Anne] Ninety seconds.

34:08.140 --> 34:10.380
[Cliff] Make sure you're
tasting your dishes, please.

34:10.380 --> 34:11.410
Oh, that's good.

34:11.410 --> 34:12.740
[Cliff] Plate, plate, plate.

34:14.380 --> 34:15.510
-Five,
-[Cliff] Five...

34:15.520 --> 34:16.450
[Anne and Cliff] Four...

34:16.450 --> 34:18.320
three, two...

34:18.320 --> 34:20.050
one, that's it.

34:20.050 --> 34:21.420
[Anne] Hands up, you're done!

34:21.920 --> 34:22.750
Ooh.

34:22.760 --> 34:23.720
Okeydokey,

34:23.720 --> 34:25.720
I'm ready to have some tasting.

34:25.730 --> 34:27.060
I'm excited.

34:27.060 --> 34:29.530
That whole thing was no gnocchi.

34:30.200 --> 34:31.460
Jokey.

34:33.030 --> 34:34.470
All right, Bianca.

34:34.470 --> 34:36.370
[Bianca] I created gnocchi

34:36.370 --> 34:38.270
and vodka sauce.

34:38.270 --> 34:39.770
[Cliff] And you added sausage?

34:39.770 --> 34:41.270
Italian sausage.
Mmm-hmm.

34:41.280 --> 34:42.840
- [Cliff] Good job with the gnocchi.
- Thank you, Chef.

34:42.840 --> 34:43.980
The sausage is cooked.

34:43.980 --> 34:46.240
The sauce does not
taste bad, it's just sweet.

34:46.250 --> 34:49.080
- Right.
- You would have had to add a lot acid to this...

34:49.080 --> 34:50.120
- Gotcha.
- In order to balance out

34:50.120 --> 34:51.880
because there's so much
tomato paste.

34:51.890 --> 34:53.150
- Understood.
- For your first shot

34:53.150 --> 34:54.520
at making a vodka sauce

34:54.520 --> 34:56.660
- you get an A for effort.
- Thank you, Chef.

34:57.520 --> 34:59.090
- [Cliff] Hi, Cheyenne.
- Hi.

34:59.090 --> 35:00.360
You wanna come join me?

35:00.360 --> 35:02.260
[Cheyenne] I made a gnocchi
with a cream sauce

35:02.260 --> 35:06.000
that has garlic, shallots,
pancetta and oregano.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.930
- Gnocchi are really nice.
- Thank you.

35:07.940 --> 35:10.300
- Have you worked with fresh oregano before?
- [crickets chirping]

35:10.300 --> 35:12.970
- No. Okay.
- Okay. There's a lot of oregano.

35:12.970 --> 35:14.410
You back down on that?
[clicks tongue]

35:14.410 --> 35:15.310
Okay.

35:15.310 --> 35:17.880
- [Cliff] Peachez.
- Let's do this!

35:17.880 --> 35:19.210
[Cliff] It's a very pretty
bowl of gnocchi.

35:19.210 --> 35:20.310
[Peachez] Thank you.

35:20.310 --> 35:23.320
I did a pine nut,
pea and gorgonzola,

35:23.320 --> 35:24.520
sage sauce

35:24.520 --> 35:27.520
with ricotta gnocchi
and a little bit of chicken.

35:27.520 --> 35:29.320
The gorgonzola
is not overpowering.

35:29.320 --> 35:31.990
So, great job incorporating
that into the sauce.

35:31.990 --> 35:33.260
The textural contrast

35:33.260 --> 35:35.430
of the pine nuts, the peas

35:35.430 --> 35:37.400
and the soft pillows
of ricotta gnocchi

35:37.400 --> 35:38.500
are really, really nice.

35:38.500 --> 35:40.870
- Very, very good dish.
- Thank you so much, Chef.

35:40.870 --> 35:42.330
Eddie, come here.

35:43.200 --> 35:45.040
Thank you, sir.
What do I have before me?

35:45.040 --> 35:48.240
[Eddie] A spinach, basil
and mushroom cream sauce

35:48.240 --> 35:50.540
with twice-removed shrimp.

35:50.540 --> 35:53.010
So, are there
any shrimp in here?

35:53.010 --> 35:54.610
They did not come back.

35:54.620 --> 35:56.050
- The dumplings are great.
- That's awesome.

35:56.050 --> 35:58.920
The sauce is seasoned well.
I do like the mushroom in it.

35:58.920 --> 36:00.320
I don't taste the shrimp
which is good.

36:00.320 --> 36:01.720
That's very good.

36:01.720 --> 36:03.490
You were frustrating
the hell out of me.

36:03.490 --> 36:04.490
I picked up on that.

36:04.490 --> 36:06.560
When there is a plan,

36:06.560 --> 36:08.560
I want you to follow that plan.

36:08.560 --> 36:10.530
- Yes, Chef.
- It's there for a reason.

36:10.530 --> 36:12.130
- So you can succeed.
- Right.

36:12.130 --> 36:13.200
Thank you.

36:13.700 --> 36:15.730
[Anne] My rocking red stars.

36:15.740 --> 36:17.100
Hilda, you're up first.

36:17.100 --> 36:18.470
- [Marti] All right, Hilda.
- [Hilda] All right.

36:19.170 --> 36:21.510
It's Italian sausage

36:21.510 --> 36:24.180
with green peas and basil.

36:24.180 --> 36:25.380
You're gnocchi

36:25.380 --> 36:27.180
- are a very nice texture.
- Thank you.

36:27.180 --> 36:30.020
I think your sauce is tasty,

36:30.020 --> 36:33.190
but I'm also seeing
a little bit of the water

36:33.190 --> 36:34.850
bleeding out
of the tomato sauce.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.420
That could've been
all cooked together...

36:36.420 --> 36:37.460
- Okay.
- A little bit more.

36:37.460 --> 36:39.120
- Good job.
- I appreciate it. Thank you.

36:39.890 --> 36:41.190
[Anne] Al, come on up.

36:41.200 --> 36:43.600
[Al] I did my beef and onions.

36:43.600 --> 36:46.430
Your gnocchi
are a nice consistency

36:46.430 --> 36:49.400
and your pasta dish
looks unified.

36:49.400 --> 36:51.370
Your beef could've been browned

36:51.370 --> 36:52.440
a little bit more.

36:52.440 --> 36:54.310
- Brown food tastes good.
- Okay.

36:54.310 --> 36:56.110
And when we miss that step,

36:56.110 --> 36:58.880
we miss a whole layer of flavor.

36:58.880 --> 37:00.410
I understand. Thank you.

37:01.110 --> 37:02.910
- Marti.
- Me.

37:02.920 --> 37:04.250
- [Al] Go, Marti.
- [Angie] Go, Marti.

37:04.250 --> 37:05.350
<i>[Marti] I'm super anxious</i>

37:05.350 --> 37:07.390
that my sauce
is just gonna be a salt bath.

37:07.850 --> 37:08.990
I, uh,

37:08.990 --> 37:11.820
settled on yellow tomato,
cherry tomatoes

37:11.830 --> 37:15.290
and red tomatoes
with thyme and rosemary.

37:15.300 --> 37:16.930
I think it's a little salty.

37:18.100 --> 37:19.530
<i>[Marti] Oh, my God.</i>

37:20.630 --> 37:22.270
<i>My salt,</i>

37:22.270 --> 37:24.100
could be performing
an assault on me.

37:24.940 --> 37:27.170
My anxiety is,

37:27.170 --> 37:30.210
<i>boiling more than
a pot of water on the stove.</i>

37:36.420 --> 37:37.980
I think it's a little salty.

37:39.290 --> 37:40.520
It's really salty.

37:40.590 --> 37:42.490
There's a no way that you
could eat a whole plate of this.

37:42.490 --> 37:45.120
Yes, the ocean is too salty.

37:45.130 --> 37:48.130
[ocean] Not as salty
as that damn gnocchi you made.

37:48.130 --> 37:50.530
[Anne] You could have given it
maybe a little splash

37:50.530 --> 37:52.130
of lemon juice,

37:52.130 --> 37:54.100
something to,
to perk that flavor...

37:54.100 --> 37:55.230
- Yeah.
- Back up.

37:55.240 --> 37:58.440
But your gnocchi
are cooked nicely.

37:58.440 --> 37:59.540
Thank you.

37:59.540 --> 38:01.070
[Al] Good job, Marti.

38:01.070 --> 38:02.340
All right, Kara, come on up.

38:02.340 --> 38:04.980
[Kara] I have
a tomato-based sauce

38:04.980 --> 38:06.910
with rendered bacon fat,

38:06.910 --> 38:10.220
zucchini and some basil.

38:10.220 --> 38:13.490
Your gnocchi
are a great consistency.

38:13.490 --> 38:16.390
The bacon in there gives
a nice little salty tang.

38:16.390 --> 38:18.520
The only thing
I feel like I'm missing here

38:18.530 --> 38:21.730
is like the saucy part
of the sauce.

38:21.730 --> 38:23.860
- Good job.
- Thank you, Chef Anne.

38:23.860 --> 38:25.400
All right, Angie, come on up.

38:25.400 --> 38:27.100
- [Angie] Okay.
- [Anne] What is this?

38:27.100 --> 38:29.030
It's a summer shrimp
gnocchi dish.

38:30.640 --> 38:32.900
Looking at this,
I would never guess

38:32.910 --> 38:34.210
that this was a pasta dish.

38:34.210 --> 38:36.470
Our ratios of all the stuff

38:36.480 --> 38:38.980
compared to the pasta
are reversed.

38:38.980 --> 38:40.710
[playing in rewind]

38:42.250 --> 38:46.050
And your sauce
has not come together.

38:46.050 --> 38:47.720
You definitely
needed more liquid

38:47.720 --> 38:48.950
and more cooking time.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.960
- All right, there we go. Thanks.
- Thank you, Chef.

38:50.960 --> 38:52.190
[all applauding]

38:56.730 --> 38:57.730
Oh!

38:59.570 --> 39:01.200
[Cliff] Congratulations,
recruits.

39:01.200 --> 39:03.370
You've all almost
rolled your way

39:03.370 --> 39:04.500
through another week
of boot camp.

39:04.500 --> 39:06.270
Almost.

39:06.270 --> 39:09.210
So, as always let's start
with some good news.

39:09.210 --> 39:11.210
The winner
of the main dish challenge

39:11.210 --> 39:12.540
on the blue team is...

39:14.480 --> 39:15.380
Peachez.

39:15.380 --> 39:16.720
[all cheering]

39:18.250 --> 39:19.420
[screaming]

39:19.420 --> 39:20.620
[laughing]

39:21.190 --> 39:22.220
Yes!

39:22.220 --> 39:24.660
That means
you'll also be taking home

39:24.660 --> 39:26.420
$1,000.

39:27.030 --> 39:27.990
I did it!

39:27.990 --> 39:30.260
Mama's getting some new wigs.

39:30.260 --> 39:32.500
And, blue team, you're
all safe from elimination.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.200
Of course, that means everyone

39:34.200 --> 39:36.070
will be moving forward
into the next week.

39:37.470 --> 39:40.110
There was one
of my rocking red stars

39:40.110 --> 39:42.940
that sparkled a little bit more

39:42.940 --> 39:44.210
than the rest of the team.

39:46.110 --> 39:47.150
Kara.

39:47.150 --> 39:48.480
[Angie] Yeah, you did it.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.450
I won!

39:51.250 --> 39:54.420
It feels really good.
It's unreal.

39:54.420 --> 39:56.120
- Thank you.
- [Anne] You really turned a corner.

39:56.120 --> 39:58.420
I see how hard you're working

39:58.430 --> 40:01.130
and the effort
that you put into everything

40:01.130 --> 40:02.930
and it's really
paying off for you.

40:02.930 --> 40:04.560
- So, keep it up.
- Thank you so much.

40:04.560 --> 40:07.070
So, the next recruit

40:07.070 --> 40:10.700
who is safe and will
be moving forward is...

40:12.440 --> 40:13.440
Marti.

40:13.440 --> 40:14.540
[sighs]

40:14.540 --> 40:16.370
The final recruit who is safe

40:16.740 --> 40:17.610
is...

40:20.580 --> 40:22.250
- Hilda.
- Thank you.

40:22.250 --> 40:23.650
[Kara] Well done.

40:24.480 --> 40:27.590
[Anne] Unfortunately,
that means Angie and Al,

40:27.590 --> 40:29.720
you're in the bottom.
Please step forward.

40:31.090 --> 40:32.890
You got this, buddy.

40:32.890 --> 40:34.260
I have a piece of advice for you

40:34.260 --> 40:35.890
- if you're on the bottom.
- Yes.

40:35.900 --> 40:37.600
Clench your buttcheeks
and say a prayer

40:37.600 --> 40:38.860
'cause you need it.

40:38.870 --> 40:41.000
I will, I will. Thanks.

40:42.370 --> 40:46.070
The recruit
that will not be continuing

40:46.070 --> 40:49.070
on in boot camp this week is...

40:51.740 --> 40:52.780
- Angie.
- Yeah.

40:55.410 --> 40:56.980
<i>[Angie] I'm not sad
because I'm leaving.</i>

40:56.980 --> 40:58.950
I'm sad because I'm leaving her.

41:00.120 --> 41:02.050
I'm sad that she's leaving.

41:02.060 --> 41:03.860
[Anne] Unfortunately,
I'm gonna need your apron.

41:03.860 --> 41:04.990
[Angie] Thank you.

41:04.990 --> 41:07.130
My family sent me here
to learn how to cook

41:07.130 --> 41:08.290
and I did.

41:08.300 --> 41:11.160
I loved having you on my team
and getting to know you.

41:11.160 --> 41:12.360
I'm gonna cook
a home-cooked meal.

41:12.370 --> 41:14.130
<i>Steak, potatoes</i>

41:14.130 --> 41:15.430
<i>maybe even get a lobster.</i>

41:15.440 --> 41:17.170
<i>- [Cheyenne] Can I come over?
- [Anne] Yes, for sure.</i>

41:17.170 --> 41:18.440
I'm still gonna be here.

41:18.440 --> 41:20.210
Yeah, keep that attitude.

41:20.470 --> 41:21.740
[Angie] I love you.

41:21.740 --> 41:23.370
<i>[Angie] Learning to cook here
with Cheyenne</i>

41:23.380 --> 41:24.880
has been just indescribable.

41:24.880 --> 41:26.010
Kick butt.

41:26.010 --> 41:29.210
Now, we're gonna be like,
"Hey, I cooked this."

41:29.220 --> 41:31.520
You know, we're gonna
be able to share that now.

41:33.350 --> 41:36.290
<i>- [narrator] Next time on Worst Cooks in America.
- [Peachez] Giddyup!</i>

41:36.290 --> 41:39.060
<i>[Anne] We're heading
to the wild, wild West</i>

41:39.060 --> 41:41.390
<i>for an old-fashioned showdown.</i>

41:41.390 --> 41:42.390
Oh!

41:42.400 --> 41:43.860
<i>[Cheyenne] I don't think
I've ever seen</i>

41:43.860 --> 41:45.800
<i>a cowgirl wear stilettos before.</i>

41:45.800 --> 41:47.500
<i>[Cliff] Anne and I will
each be teaching you</i>

41:47.500 --> 41:49.070
<i>a hearty
south-of-the-border favorite.</i>

41:49.070 --> 41:50.240
[Cheyenne]
I don't like this.

41:50.240 --> 41:51.470
[Peachez] Ai-ai-ai-ai.

41:51.470 --> 41:53.440
All I can do is laugh
to keep from crying.

41:54.310 --> 41:56.170
This is so fun.

41:56.180 --> 41:58.640
I want to throw in the towel.

41:58.650 --> 42:00.210
Everything's gone wrong.
