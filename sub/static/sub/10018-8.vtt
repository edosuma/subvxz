You should see the inside.

00:10.791 --> 00:13.558
- I'm sorry John.
- You don't owe me an explanation.

00:13.659 --> 00:15.147
We only went out a few times.

00:15.148 --> 00:17.484
Well, could you guys keep her
three days a week?

00:19.548 --> 00:21.917
You will not be renewed.
You're out of here.

00:21.918 --> 00:23.926
- I know you're friends.
- I'll supervise him.

00:23.927 --> 00:27.500
His fellowship runs through December.
Gives him over a month to find a job.

00:27.601 --> 00:30.228
- So do you want to join our family?
- Yes, I do.

00:30.229 --> 00:32.024
Hurry! He's gonna drown!

00:33.543 --> 00:37.276
It appears that a doctor has saved
a little boy from drowning.

00:53.393 --> 00:54.851
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

00:55.018 --> 00:58.302
- Grab a bite. He's not here.
- Of course. Why would Ross be on time?

00:58.478 --> 01:00.054
- Neal.
- He puts a kid...

01:00.228 --> 01:01.887
...in an unsecured news chopper...

01:02.062 --> 01:04.218
...and the hospital's
gonna give him an award!

01:04.396 --> 01:07.395
Neal, face it!
Ross is a bona fide hero.

01:07.563 --> 01:10.764
He's brought terrific press.
The board wants to acknowledge that.

01:10.939 --> 01:13.855
Well, why don't they ask him to stay?
Why do I have to do it?

01:14.023 --> 01:17.888
You're the one who fired him.
A fact the board is not too happy about.

01:18.066 --> 01:20.390
Is there any more cream cheese?

01:21.025 --> 01:22.353
Sorry I'm late.

01:22.526 --> 01:24.683
Please. Sorry to drag you out so early.

01:24.860 --> 01:27.775
- Juice? Bagel?
- No. I just ate.

01:27.944 --> 01:29.982
Have a seat.

01:34.321 --> 01:37.901
- Got your tux ready for tonight?
- I'm renting one. Mine's still drying out.

01:38.780 --> 01:42.645
It's gonna be quite a gala. Two aldermen
are coming, so be prepared for pictures.

01:42.823 --> 01:44.944
I've asked Mark to be the presenter.

01:45.574 --> 01:47.861
Demi Moore wasn't available?

01:48.283 --> 01:50.985
You jest, but the truth is...

01:51.408 --> 01:53.483
...we're all proud of you, Doug.

01:54.909 --> 01:56.865
All of us.

01:57.368 --> 01:58.778
Yes.

01:58.952 --> 02:03.077
So much so, we want to extend
your fellowship for another year.

02:03.870 --> 02:07.367
- Who would be my supervisor?
- Him.

02:07.579 --> 02:10.032
Hope you'll stay.
We'd hate to lose you in the ER.

02:12.039 --> 02:13.995
Well, thanks.

02:14.165 --> 02:16.950
But as I thought I was fired,
I've taken...

02:17.124 --> 02:19.162
...another position
at a private practice.

02:19.333 --> 02:22.415
I know. We'd like you
to reconsider that decision.

02:23.417 --> 02:25.373
Wouldn't we, Neal?

02:26.084 --> 02:28.241
Yes, indeed. We would.

03:25.350 --> 03:26.678
Are you gonna stay?

03:26.851 --> 03:29.518
- Do you need to know now?
- Pretty soon.

03:29.685 --> 03:33.347
Well, can I have four extra
attending shifts a month?

03:33.519 --> 03:35.640
- I could use the extra dough.
- Possibly.

03:35.811 --> 03:38.644
- How about Saturday nights off?
- Don't push your luck, pal.

03:38.812 --> 03:40.850
You think I'm kidding?

03:41.021 --> 03:44.932

Mostly female, by the handwriting.

03:45.105 --> 03:47.262
The wages of heroism.

03:47.439 --> 03:51.268
- We got a marriage proposal on the fax.
- Does it include a bank statement?

03:51.857 --> 03:55.437
Morning. I'm Dr. Carter.
You must be Ramiro.

03:55.608 --> 03:58.393
Wilbur. That's my American name.
I picked it.

03:58.567 --> 04:01.981
Interesting choice.
I understand your face feels funny.

04:02.152 --> 04:05.849
- On the right side.
- Can you show me your teeth?

04:06.528 --> 04:08.270
- How about those?
- I can't.

04:08.445 --> 04:11.230
No? Can you squeeze your eyes
real tight for me like that?

04:15.280 --> 04:17.485
- What was that?
- She thinks you're too young...

04:17.656 --> 04:19.029
...to be a doctor.

04:19.697 --> 04:23.444
- Thank you. Do you speak English?
- She don't, but I do.

04:23.616 --> 04:27.480
Okay. You have an inflammation
of the facial nerve.

04:27.658 --> 04:31.274
Also known as Bell's Palsy.
It's not serious.

04:36.286 --> 04:39.119
She still doesn't think you're a doctor.

04:39.286 --> 04:42.451
Well, tell her in four months I will be.

04:47.205 --> 04:48.782
We want to see a real doctor.

04:53.999 --> 04:55.456
Am I working Thanksgiving?

04:55.624 --> 04:56.952
- No.
- Cool.

04:57.125 --> 04:58.997
I need you to work
tomorrow night.

04:59.167 --> 05:00.826
I haven't found a night nanny yet.

05:01.001 --> 05:04.118
I can't keep covering nights for you.
I did four last week.

05:04.293 --> 05:08.335
Yeah, you're right. You've been great.
I appreciate it. I'll figure something out.

05:10.295 --> 05:12.452
- Peter.
- Yeah.

05:15.504 --> 05:17.211
I thought Zeidenberg
was covering ER.

05:17.380 --> 05:18.707
Schedule change. Why?

05:18.880 --> 05:21.630
I'm supposed to be with a surgeon
to practice my suturing.

05:21.798 --> 05:24.287
- If it's a problem-
- Not for me. Is it for you?

05:24.465 --> 05:27.499
- No.
- All right. Knee lac in Bed 5.

05:32.426 --> 05:34.879
- Hey, Hathaway!
- What have you got?

05:35.051 --> 05:36.461
An apparent suicide attempt.

05:36.635 --> 05:39.468
Brother found her next to
an empty bottle of Tylenol.

05:39.928 --> 05:42.464
- What's her name?
- Julia.

05:42.637 --> 05:45.671
Hey, Jerry, could you go find
Greene, please?

05:45.846 --> 05:47.636
- Vitals?
- She's normal.

05:47.805 --> 05:51.337
Hey, listen, I got the number
of that roofer for you.

05:51.514 --> 05:54.181
- Oh, great. Thanks.
- I hear you bought a real money pit.

05:54.348 --> 05:56.007
Yeah? Where'd you hear that?

05:56.182 --> 05:57.924
- Tylenol OD?
- Yeah.

05:58.099 --> 06:00.221
How much did you take, Julia?

06:01.725 --> 06:03.384
When did you take it, sweetheart?

06:03.559 --> 06:05.301
She hasn't said a word.

06:05.476 --> 06:08.558
We need an acetaminophen level,
liver-function tests...

06:08.727 --> 06:11.726
...gastric lavage,
50 grams activated charcoal.

06:11.894 --> 06:13.471
Coming up!

06:13.978 --> 06:16.135
- Is she gonna live?
- Yeah.

06:16.312 --> 06:17.971
Haleh.

06:18.229 --> 06:21.228
Come on, hon.
You want something to eat?

06:39.193 --> 06:42.228
Good morning.
I see you're making yourself at home.

06:42.403 --> 06:43.730
I hope you don't mind.

06:43.903 --> 06:47.352
I find having a few knick-knacks around
makes a room more cheerful.

06:47.529 --> 06:49.899
So you're feeling fatigued?

06:51.238 --> 06:52.980
A bit fatigued, I'm afraid.

06:53.155 --> 06:56.652
I was hoping you could give me
something to put me back on my feet.

06:56.823 --> 06:59.775
- Any fevers, colds?
- Neither one.

06:59.949 --> 07:02.520
Any headaches, vomiting?

07:02.700 --> 07:04.442
No, a bit short of breath.

07:04.617 --> 07:08.481
- Are you on any medication?
- No. No. Not a drop.

07:10.869 --> 07:13.488
Oh, listen to that poor little lamb.

07:15.078 --> 07:19.487
I wanna x-ray your chest, rule out
pneumonia and do a blood test, okay?

07:22.747 --> 07:24.489
Teatime, is it?

07:24.664 --> 07:26.904
Well past, I'm afraid.

07:30.165 --> 07:33.496
Hey, set up an albuterol nebulizer.
Let's get a pulse ox right away.

07:33.666 --> 07:35.373
- What do you got?
- Asthma attack.

07:35.542 --> 07:38.327
- He can't breathe.
- Respiration's 40. Dusky nail beds.

07:38.501 --> 07:41.998
He's cyanotic.
Let's start a low-flow O-2.

07:42.335 --> 07:45.500
I got him here fast as I could
He got worse on the bus.

07:45.669 --> 07:47.163
- What's his name?
- Alan.

07:47.337 --> 07:48.664
Alan.

07:48.837 --> 07:51.160
Buddy, I need you to take
a deep breath on this.

07:51.338 --> 07:54.669
It's okay. It's all right.
This medicine's gonna help you breathe.

07:54.839 --> 07:57.541
Okay. Here we go. Take deep breaths.

07:57.714 --> 07:59.089
- What's the pulse ox?
-87.

07:59.256 --> 08:01.129
- Is that bad?
- About what I expected.

08:01.299 --> 08:03.669
There you go. Yeah.
There you go. Nice and slow.

08:03.841 --> 08:07.005
Slow, slow. Deep breaths.

08:07.842 --> 08:10.212
Mrs. Corvalan, I spoke to a doctor...

08:10.384 --> 08:12.671
...and he agreed with my evaluation.

08:12.843 --> 08:14.253
This is a prescription.

08:14.427 --> 08:17.177
Follow up in the clinic in five days.

08:24.471 --> 08:25.799
You're welcome.

08:25.972 --> 08:27.963
- It's not going in.
- She's biting the tube.

08:28.139 --> 08:31.719
Julia, you can't bite the tube.
We need to clean out your stomach.

08:33.390 --> 08:35.346
All right, that's it! Restraints!

08:35.515 --> 08:37.472
Settle down.
Don't make it even harder.

08:37.683 --> 08:40.552
- Tie her down.
- Stop or I'll put a tube down your nose...

08:40.726 --> 08:44.092
...and you're really not gonna like it.
Oh! She's pulling the tube out.

08:44.268 --> 08:46.343
- Damn it!
- Okay, nasogastric tube.

08:46.644 --> 08:48.849
- More charcoal?
- Good idea.

08:51.562 --> 08:54.561
I know. I'm sorry I have to do this.

08:54.730 --> 08:58.771
- I know!
- Malik, come hold her head down.

08:59.439 --> 09:02.853
- I need a new cath-tipped syringe.
- Here you go.

09:03.023 --> 09:04.896
- We're in!
-50 grams.

09:05.066 --> 09:07.637
Can we have a washcloth?

09:07.816 --> 09:09.606
All right, dear. Okay.

09:09.775 --> 09:12.691
It's okay. The worst is over.
I know.

09:13.818 --> 09:16.058
God, I hate this.

09:16.694 --> 09:19.017
It's okay.

09:22.320 --> 09:25.900
- Hey, Hathaway, I love your new scrubs.
- Yeah, right.

09:26.071 --> 09:28.607
- Tell me when her level comes back.
- Okay.

09:28.780 --> 09:31.352
- She put up a fight?
- She was really serious.

09:31.531 --> 09:35.193
That's really the exception. Most
of these girls are looking for attention.

09:35.365 --> 09:38.033
Yeah, they fight with their folks
or their boyfriend...

09:38.199 --> 09:41.364
...swallow five pills instead of two
and then call 911.

09:41.534 --> 09:44.900
I mean, come on, if you really wanna
kill yourself, forget about pills.

09:45.076 --> 09:46.534
Get yourself a straight razor.

09:46.702 --> 09:50.566
You find that artery, you slice right
on up. You'll be dead in a minute.

09:50.744 --> 09:53.364
Pills are for people
who don't really mean it.

09:53.537 --> 09:55.279
I really meant it.

09:55.454 --> 09:57.659
Yeah, right.

10:04.832 --> 10:06.373
She's kidding, right?

10:14.792 --> 10:16.665
Mom, it's not a "money" kind of favor.

10:16.835 --> 10:19.833
I was hoping you and dad
could look after Susie tomorrow night.

10:20.002 --> 10:22.040
- What time?
- About 8 a. m.

10:22.211 --> 10:25.827
- You mean she'd have to sleep here?
- Yes, she would have to sleep there.

10:26.004 --> 10:29.205
Jerry, can we get an acetaminophen
level on that suicide attempt?

10:29.380 --> 10:31.170
Yeah, I'll call the lab.

10:31.547 --> 10:33.668
I need to get on there when you're done.

10:33.839 --> 10:36.838
- I'm done.
- Yeah? Thanks.

10:37.007 --> 10:40.089
- What time are you getting off tonight?
- About 6.

10:40.841 --> 10:43.793
- Do you want to have dinner?
- I got a presentation.

10:43.967 --> 10:46.503
It's not until next week,
but I've got to prepare...

10:46.676 --> 10:49.295
Carter, did you work up this kid
with facial paralysis?

10:49.468 --> 10:51.127
I'm sorry, am I interrupting?

10:51.302 --> 10:53.258
- No. See you.
- Bye.

10:53.428 --> 10:56.426
Yes I did. He had Bell's Palsy.

10:56.595 --> 11:00.009
- No vesicles or sores in his ears?
- I don't think so.

11:00.180 --> 11:03.380
- You're not sure?
- Pretty sure. Why?

11:03.555 --> 11:07.337
Well, vesicles indicate Ramsay Hunt
syndrome which could infect the brain.

11:07.515 --> 11:08.973
I wasn't looking for vesicles.

11:09.140 --> 11:13.799
If you think you missed them, I'd call
his folks, get him in here and make sure.

11:14.392 --> 11:18.552
Yeah, mom. Yeah, I know how you are
when you don't get enough sleep. Okay.

11:18.726 --> 11:21.595
Okay, bye.
So much for Ozzie and Harriet.

11:21.769 --> 11:24.933
- Any other ideas?
- Call in sick?

11:25.103 --> 11:27.853
I'm kidding. Just kidding.

11:28.104 --> 11:30.972
Here, Julia. If you need anything,
just press this button.

11:31.146 --> 11:32.604
Carol.

11:34.897 --> 11:37.102
- Levels back?
-480.

11:37.273 --> 11:39.311
Oh, she must have swallowed
two bottles.

11:39.482 --> 11:41.556
She could be in line for a new liver.

11:41.732 --> 11:44.897
Start Mucomyst.
12 grams through the nose.

11:45.067 --> 11:47.223
Let me know when her LFTs come in.

11:47.400 --> 11:50.316
- Contact her folks?
- Don't have a number. She won't talk.

11:50.485 --> 11:53.318
- Have you seen her brother?
- Not I.

11:56.653 --> 11:58.229
Open your mouth.

11:58.403 --> 12:00.690
There you go.
Now you're getting the hang of it.

12:00.862 --> 12:02.605
Pulse ox is up to 98.

12:02.780 --> 12:05.814
You had me scared there for a while.
Any idea how this happened?

12:05.989 --> 12:07.363
Granny's got a collie.

12:07.531 --> 12:13.031
Let me see this. Okay, Mrs. Almont,
Alan will be fine. Does he live with you?

12:13.199 --> 12:16.198
No. Just visiting for the week
while his folks are out of town.

12:16.742 --> 12:20.404
Okay, well, if he'll be staying with you,
you'll have to get rid of the dog.

12:20.576 --> 12:23.491
- You're the doctor who was on the TV!
- Yes, that's me.

12:24.785 --> 12:26.860
You're gonna be okay, sugar.

12:27.036 --> 12:29.703
That's the doctor from the TV!

12:29.870 --> 12:31.861
Doug, I talked to the boy's HMO.

12:32.037 --> 12:34.324
- They want him at their Urgent Care.
- Where?

12:34.496 --> 12:36.404
- Oak Park.
- That's ridiculous.

12:36.580 --> 12:40.445
He was in acute respiratory distress.
I'm not sending him across town.

12:40.790 --> 12:42.199
His pulse ox is up to 98.

12:42.373 --> 12:45.408
And I want to make sure
that it stays that way.

12:45.583 --> 12:47.538
- There.
- "Pulse ox, 89"?

12:47.708 --> 12:49.699
Tell his HMO that, they'll let him stay.

12:49.875 --> 12:51.452
What's going on?

12:53.710 --> 12:56.033
Dr. Ross, I'm not fudging
my nursing notes.

12:56.210 --> 12:58.913
- Nobody's asking you to.
- There's gonna be a discrepancy.

12:59.086 --> 13:00.828
I'm not sending him out.

13:07.672 --> 13:10.208
Do you know why she did it?

13:11.423 --> 13:14.208
My mom died in a car accident last May.

13:14.424 --> 13:16.960
- Might have something to do with it.
- They were close?

13:17.299 --> 13:18.958
Not really.

13:19.717 --> 13:21.708
Does Julia get along with your dad okay?

13:22.968 --> 13:26.299
- He ain't around.
- He works a lot?

13:26.885 --> 13:29.421
He just can't deal with stuff.

13:29.594 --> 13:32.463
I don't think he likes being in the house.

13:35.138 --> 13:37.294
Do you have a phone number for him?

13:41.639 --> 13:43.677
Yeah.

13:49.933 --> 13:51.971
Somewhere.

13:57.435 --> 14:00.350
Dr. Carter. County General.

14:05.479 --> 14:07.933
- What was that about?
- I might have misdiagnosed.

14:08.105 --> 14:09.977
- Ramsay Hunt.
- Forgot to check the ears?

14:10.147 --> 14:13.679
No, I checked, but I wasn't thinking
Ramsay Hunt, so I didn't look for it.

14:13.856 --> 14:16.013
Pretty big miss.
Bring him back to make sure.

14:16.190 --> 14:19.105
A lady with chest pain,
history of lupus and renal failure.

14:19.274 --> 14:21.100
Benton said you should take it.

14:21.275 --> 14:23.432
Don't miss anything.

14:28.818 --> 14:31.770
Oh, your x-rays are back.

14:34.778 --> 14:38.359
- Poor dear was exhausted.
- Your lungs look fine.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.816
- Would you...?
- Oh, sure.

14:43.447 --> 14:45.983
- Thank you, love.
- Yeah.

14:46.240 --> 14:50.317
- I have another cup.
- Oh, no. I'm fine, thank you.

14:56.576 --> 15:00.191
- Do you work with children?
- Yes.

15:00.369 --> 15:02.940
I raised three right here in Chicago.

15:03.119 --> 15:06.865
Of course, they grew up
and made me obsolete.

15:07.329 --> 15:09.783
Are you looking for work?

15:10.621 --> 15:12.945
Yes, actually.

15:13.122 --> 15:14.947
Work nights?

15:15.873 --> 15:18.658
Pour it through the strainer
if you would, please.

15:23.958 --> 15:27.040
Chuny, can I not read your writing,
or is that a 98?

15:27.209 --> 15:28.667
That's a 98.

15:28.834 --> 15:31.952
So you wrote down this asthmatic kid's
pulse ox as 98...

15:32.127 --> 15:36.252
...and five minutes later, Doug
noted it 89? Did he crash?

15:36.420 --> 15:38.210
He didn't crash.

15:38.379 --> 15:42.208
Could this be a case of numerical
inversion due to temporary dyslexia?

15:42.380 --> 15:44.122
I don't know. I'm just a nurse.

15:44.297 --> 15:48.126
So I'm correct in deducing
that there's an inconsistency here?

15:48.298 --> 15:50.455
- Looks that way.
- Someone made a mistake.

15:52.716 --> 15:54.043
I didn't make a mistake.

15:55.758 --> 15:57.382
Thank you.

15:59.926 --> 16:02.925
- Give me a sec. Carol?
- Yeah?

16:03.094 --> 16:06.958
Look, I'm really sorry
for being a jerk back there before.

16:07.136 --> 16:10.301
- I didn't know.
- It's no big deal. Don't worry about it.

16:10.471 --> 16:15.212
No, it is to me. Can we get together
later and have dinner or go to a movie?

16:15.389 --> 16:18.720
Look, I'm busy, but I'll call you, okay?

16:19.556 --> 16:21.761
- I don't hear anything unusual.
- Temp's normal.

16:21.932 --> 16:25.133
Mrs. Briggs, sit tight.
We'll be right back.

16:25.433 --> 16:30.471
Let's order a CBC, Chem-7,
ABG, EKG, chest film.

16:30.643 --> 16:34.969
Abdominal series. Anti-DNA,
anticentromere, antiphospholipid...

16:35.144 --> 16:38.510
- ... antibody, cryoglobulins.
- That's gonna be $2000 right there.

16:38.686 --> 16:42.135
- I don't wanna miss anything.
- Is this because she's Vucelich's patient?

16:42.312 --> 16:43.971
She's Vucelich's patient?

16:44.146 --> 16:46.814
Better get a cardiac echo too.
And a CT.

16:46.980 --> 16:49.765
260. Good job, Alan.

16:49.939 --> 16:53.187
- Doug?
- Let's get one more neb treatment.

16:53.357 --> 16:55.727
And then I'll okay him for transfer.
Okay?

16:55.899 --> 17:00.060
- Doctor? Thank you so very much.
- You're very welcome.

17:00.234 --> 17:02.770
- You wanna fill me in?
- Kid had a bad asthma attack...

17:02.943 --> 17:06.191
- ... and his HMO wanted him transferred.
- So you falsified his chart?

17:06.359 --> 17:08.268
- That's sounds right.
- It's illegal.

17:08.444 --> 17:11.608
- Should I put him on a bus to Oak Park?
- You should've come to me.

17:11.779 --> 17:14.019
I could've called his HMO
and backed you up.

17:14.195 --> 17:17.776
But now, when they see this,
they're not gonna pay.

17:17.946 --> 17:21.479
There's no way I can justify a lie
of a new medical record.

17:21.656 --> 17:24.773
- We're just gonna have to eat it.
- Good. Eat it.

17:26.824 --> 17:31.068
I can't keep banging heads with you
every other day. It's just too much work.

17:31.242 --> 17:35.319
If you're gonna stay here and work
for me, this cowboy crap has gotta stop.

17:35.993 --> 17:41.150
Stay here and work for you?
Now there is an attractive prospect.

17:41.328 --> 17:44.695
Is that what this is about? You can't
take the fact that I'm your boss?

17:44.871 --> 17:49.825
Typically narcissistic of you. I can't
take the fact that anyone is my boss.

17:56.665 --> 17:59.581
I need to speak to your sister alone.

18:02.375 --> 18:03.999
Okay.

18:12.295 --> 18:15.495
- How are you feeling?
- Okay.

18:15.837 --> 18:18.124
Do these have to stay on?

18:24.340 --> 18:26.911
We took some new tests.

18:28.049 --> 18:30.834
One of them was a pregnancy test.

18:33.509 --> 18:35.962
It came back positive.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.546
You knew that.

18:42.094 --> 18:44.583
Did that have something to do
with taking the pills?

18:48.179 --> 18:52.304
Sometimes keeping things inside makes
them seem worse than they actually are.

18:54.014 --> 18:55.342
You don't know.

18:58.349 --> 19:01.051
I know about wanting to die.

19:02.350 --> 19:04.424
I took a bunch of pills a year ago.

19:13.561 --> 19:16.180
I loved my mom.

19:18.062 --> 19:20.267
When she died...

19:20.563 --> 19:22.969
...it's like everything fell apart.

19:24.731 --> 19:27.302
Kyle was a mess.

19:28.982 --> 19:33.605
At night I'd hear him crying,
like when he was little.

19:40.276 --> 19:42.563
We never meant for it to happen.

19:43.569 --> 19:47.231
I only went in to hold him
until he stopped crying.

19:49.654 --> 19:52.273
And now I'm pregnant.

19:56.948 --> 19:58.606
It's okay.

20:10.910 --> 20:14.572
If I had recommendations this strong
I could've gone to an Ivy League school.

20:14.744 --> 20:16.071
Recommendations?

20:16.244 --> 20:19.160
This patient of mine's a nanny.
Her agency faxed them over.

20:19.328 --> 20:22.327
- Her name's not Ransom, is it?
- Yeah.

20:22.496 --> 20:24.950
Don't count on
any long-term commitment.

20:25.122 --> 20:28.405
Oh, no. Oh, no.

20:28.581 --> 20:30.074
- Heads up.
- I got it.

20:30.248 --> 20:34.113
51 year old male, vitals normal. Involved
in a Civil War re-enactment of...

20:34.291 --> 20:37.622
Battle of Malvern Hill.
Took on Lee, Magruder and Stonewall.

20:37.792 --> 20:40.079
Two ton cannon broke loose,
rolled over his toe.

20:40.251 --> 20:42.740
Damn artillery sergeant.
Ought to be court-martialed.

20:42.918 --> 20:48.253
Let me take a look. Oh, yeah.
That is pretty smushed up. What's open?

20:48.420 --> 20:49.747
Trauma 1.

20:49.920 --> 20:52.919
It was musket butt to bayonet
all morning.

20:53.087 --> 20:56.750
The damn rebels were thicker than fleas
on a dog's back!

20:58.464 --> 21:00.585
- Hi.
- She told you.

21:00.756 --> 21:04.123
Kyle, whatever she told me
is confidential. I'm not free to discuss it.

21:04.507 --> 21:06.498
She told me she told you.

21:06.758 --> 21:09.425
We're gonna do everything we can
to help you guys, okay?

21:09.634 --> 21:11.589
Oh, man, she did tell you!

21:11.759 --> 21:16.631
When my dad finds out, he's gonna kill
me! Kill me, man! He carries a gun!

21:16.802 --> 21:20.927
Kyle, I'm not gonna tell your father
anything you don't want him to know.

21:21.095 --> 21:23.465
I'm not waiting to find out,
know what I'm saying?

21:23.637 --> 21:25.593
Kyle!

21:27.805 --> 21:30.472
You wanted to practice your suturing?
Here's your man.

21:30.639 --> 21:32.097
Turned 25 years old today.

21:32.265 --> 21:34.469
Celebrated by drinking himself
into a stupor...

21:34.640 --> 21:36.715
...and walking through
a plate glass window.

21:36.891 --> 21:38.597
It's a two man job.
Carter will help.

21:38.766 --> 21:41.635
Let's get the chest films first,
then the echocardiogram.

21:41.809 --> 21:43.136
The echo guy was here first.

21:43.309 --> 21:46.059
- I got a heart and spleen waiting.
- Give me two minutes.

21:46.227 --> 21:47.554
- Carter.
- What?

21:47.727 --> 21:49.137
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

21:49.311 --> 21:53.969
She's got a history of lupus and renal
failure and complained of chest pain...

21:54.145 --> 21:56.516
- ... so I'm working her up.
- Carter, come.

22:00.897 --> 22:02.805
Excuse me.

22:04.356 --> 22:08.434
Carter, only an idiot would order
that many tests for chest pain.

22:08.608 --> 22:12.056
I'm trying to be thorough.
She's Dr. Vucelich's patient.

22:12.234 --> 22:13.691
- You're kidding?
- No.

22:13.859 --> 22:15.400
- Oh, damn.
- Dr. Benton.

22:15.568 --> 22:17.144
Oh, God.

22:17.902 --> 22:20.936
Tell me, did you order these labs
on my patient?

22:21.111 --> 22:24.193
Dr. Vucelich, I apologize.
I left my student unsupervise-

22:24.362 --> 22:27.728
No. I take full responsibility.
Dr. Benton had nothing to do with this.

22:27.904 --> 22:30.820
- Then you're the one I should thank.
- Thank?

22:30.989 --> 22:33.822
Yes, the test for antiphospholipid
antibodies was positive.

22:33.989 --> 22:39.063
She has a serious blood disease. We
need to put her on heparin right away.

22:39.241 --> 22:42.856
So tell me,
what was your thinking, son?

22:43.033 --> 22:45.190
Actually, there was very little.

22:45.367 --> 22:48.698
Mrs. Briggs has a very complex history,
so I took a shotgun approach.

22:48.868 --> 22:51.239
- Don't underestimate yourself, Mister...
- Carter.

22:51.411 --> 22:55.701
Carter, right. Given the circumstances,
your approach was more than valid.

22:55.870 --> 22:57.945
Not that I advocate
indiscriminate testing.

22:58.121 --> 23:00.824
No need to run Chem-20s
on every runny nose, right?

23:00.997 --> 23:04.908
But when someone has a constellation
of problems, you can't hold back.

23:05.081 --> 23:07.155
Remember that, Benton.

23:07.332 --> 23:08.908
- Good work.
- Thank you, thank you.

23:09.082 --> 23:15.330
By the way, I'm doing a fem-pop bypass.
You wanna assist?

23:16.626 --> 23:17.953
Go, Carter.

23:18.126 --> 23:20.366
- You know the procedure?
- Fem-pop bypass?

23:20.543 --> 23:21.871
How many have you done?

23:23.294 --> 23:25.499
Mrs. Ransom?

23:27.504 --> 23:29.957
I must have drifted off.

23:32.005 --> 23:35.454
- Did you get my references?
- Oh, yes. Yes.

23:35.631 --> 23:39.921
- Very, very impressive.
- Thank you.

23:40.090 --> 23:44.215
I was thinking that I could
drop around tonight.

23:44.383 --> 23:47.003
Make it a little less intrusive
on the little one.

23:47.592 --> 23:50.295
Mrs. Ransom, we need to talk
about your blood tests.

23:50.843 --> 23:53.214
Your red and white cells
and platelet count...

23:53.385 --> 23:58.293
...are extremely low,
which is suggestive of aplastic anemia...

23:58.470 --> 24:00.627
...which is very serious.

24:02.680 --> 24:08.346
Perhaps you could give me
a few pills. Pep me up.

24:09.223 --> 24:12.471
Mrs. Ransom, your condition
is most likely terminal.

24:13.849 --> 24:17.180
You need to be admitted to the
hospital for a bone-marrow biopsy.

24:17.725 --> 24:21.637
Oh, Pish-posh!
Not another one of those!

24:21.810 --> 24:24.216
- You've had one?
- Yes, months ago.

24:24.394 --> 24:27.346
Most unpleasant.

24:27.520 --> 24:29.392
Have you been getting transfusions?

24:29.645 --> 24:32.597
From their description,
they are simply ghastly. No, no, no.

24:32.771 --> 24:38.307
I would rather just carry on
and, you know, hope for the best.

24:41.982 --> 24:43.356
I...

24:43.941 --> 24:47.686
I could come around about 7 tonight...

24:49.150 --> 24:50.727
...if that's convenient with you.

24:51.443 --> 24:57.062
Mrs. Ransom, your disease has reached
a stage where you can't work anymore.

24:57.319 --> 24:59.773
You need to be admitted
to the hospital.

25:03.029 --> 25:08.529
I think I'm the better judge of that.
Don't you?

25:25.618 --> 25:27.740
Oh, man, that smarts!

25:27.911 --> 25:31.028
You've avulsed most of the skin
off the top of your big toe.

25:31.203 --> 25:34.901
Just saw it off and throw it in a basket.
I need to get back to the field.

25:35.079 --> 25:36.952
Amputation isn't necessary.

25:37.121 --> 25:40.322
I just launched a countercharge
at Jackson's center.

25:40.497 --> 25:42.156
Damn cannon came off the blocks.

25:42.331 --> 25:46.112
- Are you General Grant?
- No, Grant wasn't at Malvern Hill.

25:46.291 --> 25:50.368
I'm Major General Fitz-John Porter,
tactical genius.

25:50.542 --> 25:53.291
Used the 5th Corps
to outflank two rebel divisions...

25:53.459 --> 25:55.664
...and drive them back
across the Chickahominy.

25:55.835 --> 25:59.082
I have to rongeur the bone.
Let's get Mr. Richter some lidocaine.

25:59.252 --> 26:03.792
No, ether. That's all Porter had
when they cut off his leg.

26:03.962 --> 26:08.620
Mr. Richter, we haven't used ether
as an anesthetic in over 40 years.

26:08.797 --> 26:12.163
- Lidocaine. 2% digital block.
- Just give me a bullet to bite on.

26:12.339 --> 26:15.208
- We may be out.
- I got it.

26:20.341 --> 26:23.091
Could we send out a private
to round up some bourbon?

26:23.259 --> 26:26.874
No, Mr. Richter,
we're fresh out of privates as well.

26:27.051 --> 26:32.932
I'm about to use this tool
to grind down the bone in your toe.

26:33.303 --> 26:36.716
I highly recommend
that you take the lidocaine.

26:36.887 --> 26:41.048
Not as long as I'm in command.
Go to it, surgeon!

26:41.222 --> 26:43.592
Do your stuff!

27:00.060 --> 27:04.683
I saw your sister, Jackie last week,
near the State of lllinois building.

27:04.853 --> 27:07.935
She was buying a Polish dog
from a vendor.

27:08.104 --> 27:10.060
I don't think she saw me.

27:12.272 --> 27:16.516
- She's supposed to be on a diet.
- Busted.

27:16.690 --> 27:19.854
- She works near there.
- Didn't she work at the gardens?

27:20.024 --> 27:21.683
Used to.

27:22.733 --> 27:25.436
Always wanted to work outdoors.

27:26.150 --> 27:29.066
- She's allergic to pollen.
- You're kidding?

27:31.777 --> 27:34.147
So they put her in a room
with no windows.

27:34.319 --> 27:35.812
And a plastic plant.

27:38.695 --> 27:40.023
Probably.

27:44.822 --> 27:46.897
She told me she saw you.

27:49.823 --> 27:51.945
Didn't tell me about the hot dog, though.

28:01.118 --> 28:03.738
I'm Richard Kazlaw.
I was told Julia's here.

28:03.911 --> 28:06.067
Mr. Kazlaw, I'm Dr. Greene.

28:06.244 --> 28:09.576
Julia tried to kill herself,
but good news is, she's okay.

28:09.745 --> 28:12.993
- Where is she?
- She's actually with a social worker now.

28:13.163 --> 28:15.652
And you can see her when they're done.

28:16.289 --> 28:21.659
If you could just fill out this paperwork,
consent form, that sort of thing.

28:21.874 --> 28:24.707
High speed motorcycle collision.
Victim has abdominal pains.

28:24.874 --> 28:28.039
BP in the field of 80/50.
Repeat BPs came up with 300...

28:28.209 --> 28:31.741
Head trauma, non-responsive,
GCS seven, possible tib-fib fracture.

28:31.918 --> 28:34.324
- Wearing a helmet?
- No, neither of them.

28:34.502 --> 28:37.417
Get a CBC. Dip a urine for blood.

28:37.586 --> 28:41.628
Get X-ray to run the spine, cervical,
thoracic and lumbar.

28:41.796 --> 28:43.834
Chuny, see if he's oriented.

28:44.005 --> 28:45.877
- What's your name?
- Tom Spagnoli.

28:46.047 --> 28:49.211
- What's the date?
- November. My stomach's killing me!

28:49.381 --> 28:53.376
- He's got a tire track on his belly.
- Bowel sounds, hypoactive.

28:53.549 --> 28:55.374
Possible intra-abdominal hemorrhage.

28:55.549 --> 28:57.090
- DPL?
- No, he's got a scar here.

28:57.258 --> 28:59.333
- I had an operation as a kid.
- Laparotomy?

28:59.509 --> 29:01.915
We can't lavage on him.
Tell CT to hold a table.

29:03.176 --> 29:05.167
- Let's get a Foley in.
- He opened his eyes.

29:05.344 --> 29:07.833
Can you hear me?
Do you know where you are?

29:08.011 --> 29:11.093
- Response to pain. Otoscope!
- Moves extremities times four.

29:11.262 --> 29:13.881
- No obvious paralysis.
- Let's get X-ray.

29:14.054 --> 29:16.378
Cross-table C-spine.
He's got blood in the canal.

29:16.555 --> 29:17.882
Ross has X-ray.

29:18.055 --> 29:21.718
- Fundi's normal. Disks are flat.
- Maybe it's just a skull fracture.

29:21.890 --> 29:23.762
I'm worried about the blood
in his ears.

29:23.932 --> 29:26.765
- Tell CT to hold a table.
- Dr. Ross is holding already.

29:30.225 --> 29:33.757
- What have you got?
- Tire marks across belly. Bruising.

29:33.934 --> 29:36.933
Got a lap scar, so I can't DPL him.
I'm sending him up to CT.

29:37.102 --> 29:38.725
- Rebound, guarding?
- Little bit.

29:38.894 --> 29:41.893
My kid's got blood in the canal.
He's sicker so he'll go first.

29:42.062 --> 29:44.811
- Wait. He could have a ruptured spleen.
- What's his crit?

29:44.979 --> 29:47.551
- Forty-two.
- It's normal. He can wait.

29:49.105 --> 29:53.182
- Lateral C-spine is next.
- Set up suction.

29:54.940 --> 29:56.766
Ophthalmoscope.

30:00.525 --> 30:03.856
Pupils are fine. No papilledema.

30:04.026 --> 30:06.064
- There's blood in the canal.
- Otoscope.

30:06.235 --> 30:09.436
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- He has a skull fracture.

30:09.611 --> 30:11.685
You're out of line.
Go back to your patient.

30:11.861 --> 30:15.524
- My patient is going to CT.
- No! This kid is going to CT now!

30:15.696 --> 30:18.232
Fine, mine's going to the O.R.
for an exploratory lap.

30:18.405 --> 30:22.269
Like hell! You're not putting a patient
under the knife to win a pissing contest.

30:22.447 --> 30:23.775
Damn right!

30:23.948 --> 30:27.279
It's so he doesn't bleed while you
tie up the CT for a skull fracture!

30:27.490 --> 30:29.031
- Go home!
- What?

30:29.199 --> 30:32.447
I'm taking over your patient
and writing you up! Go home!

30:32.617 --> 30:34.774
Let's get a portable ultrasound in here.

30:34.951 --> 30:36.776
Check out the belly.
Let's go, come on!

30:36.951 --> 30:39.619
So that's why she swallowed
two bottles of pills.

30:39.785 --> 30:41.942
Yeah. Awful.

30:42.119 --> 30:44.739
- He was forcing himself on his sister?
- No.

30:44.912 --> 30:48.741
It came out of grief over losing their
mother. She went in to comfort him...

30:48.913 --> 30:52.860
- ... and they ended up sleeping together.
- And now she's pregnant.

30:54.331 --> 30:56.618
Can I help you? Sir?

31:01.291 --> 31:02.868
What?

31:03.542 --> 31:05.616
The name on the consent.

31:07.459 --> 31:09.249
Oh, God.

31:10.710 --> 31:13.282
It appears that your father
may have overheard...

31:13.461 --> 31:16.625
...two of our staff members
discussing your case.

31:16.795 --> 31:18.288
Oh, man.

31:19.588 --> 31:21.543
He's gonna kill me.

31:21.713 --> 31:23.704
Do you really think
that he might hurt you?

31:23.880 --> 31:25.255
Yeah.

31:25.548 --> 31:28.297
Someone's gonna stay
with you at all times.

31:28.632 --> 31:31.085
I'm afraid that we
didn't handle this very well.

31:31.257 --> 31:33.960
I wanna make sure you guys are okay.

31:34.258 --> 31:35.917
Tony's gonna stay with you.

31:36.092 --> 31:37.918
Lydia, Carol...

31:38.093 --> 31:40.795
You have no idea how sorry I am.

31:46.011 --> 31:48.168
- Stupid to talk about it in the open.
- Really.

31:48.345 --> 31:50.253
Put protecting patient
confidentiality...

31:50.429 --> 31:53.262
...at the top of the agenda
for tomorrow's staff meeting.

31:53.430 --> 31:55.670
I got the girl an ICU bed.
We should move her.

31:55.847 --> 31:58.134
- Alert Security, in case there's trouble.
- Okay.

31:58.306 --> 32:01.471
- Dr. Ross. Your tux came in.
- Great, Jerry. Thanks.

32:01.640 --> 32:05.173
- Wait. That's Dr. Greene's.
- Okay.

32:05.350 --> 32:07.555
- Ready for your big award?
- Yeah. Can't wait.

32:07.850 --> 32:10.091
- Doug, you got a sec?
- No.

32:11.101 --> 32:13.092
Hey, Dr. Ross. Phone for you.

32:13.269 --> 32:15.639
- Who is it?
- Your father.

32:15.811 --> 32:17.601
- Who?
- He said he was your dad.

32:18.395 --> 32:21.477
- Hello?
- It's your dad.

32:22.771 --> 32:25.095
- How are you, son?
- Fine.

32:25.355 --> 32:28.354
I know it's been a while.
I was wondering if I could see you.

32:28.523 --> 32:30.597
This isn't a good time. So...

32:30.773 --> 32:32.432
- You sure?
- Yeah. Okay, I gotta go.

32:32.607 --> 32:35.641
- How can I reach you?
- Here is fine.

32:35.816 --> 32:37.440
Bye.

32:42.110 --> 32:44.101
I thought he and his father didn't speak.

32:44.277 --> 32:46.896
As far as I know,
he hasn't since he was 12.

32:47.069 --> 32:49.523
This is gonna be an interesting evening.

32:49.778 --> 32:51.355
One more.

32:52.196 --> 32:53.819
All right, last one.

32:55.113 --> 32:57.519
- Nice.
- Fun.

32:58.114 --> 33:00.437
- I like the staple gun.
- Hey, hey.

33:00.698 --> 33:03.365
- Hey, guys.
- Carter, how was surgery?

33:03.532 --> 33:07.064
Incredible. Watching Carl anastomose
is truly a humbling experience.

33:07.241 --> 33:10.690
I got to hold the bulldog clamp.
I got it on tape if you wanna see it.

33:11.034 --> 33:12.610
- Pass.
- No?

33:12.784 --> 33:15.356
I'll get some Xeroform dressings
for our birthday boy.

33:15.535 --> 33:17.159
- Bye.
- Bye.

33:20.620 --> 33:21.947
- Very attractive.
- Carter!

33:22.120 --> 33:24.444
And smart too. And available.

33:24.621 --> 33:26.908
- She's married.
- No, she's not.

33:27.080 --> 33:29.948
- What are you talking about?
- She told me she was divorced.

33:31.915 --> 33:35.956
So listen, if it's okay, I finished my notes
on your patients. I'd like to take off.

33:37.916 --> 33:40.370
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, Carter, go.

33:40.625 --> 33:42.118
I'll see you tomorrow.

33:51.295 --> 33:53.250
How's it going?

33:53.420 --> 33:55.625
Yeah. That's right.

33:58.672 --> 34:00.330
Hello there.

34:00.505 --> 34:03.504
- Please tell me he's your father.
- He's my father.

34:03.673 --> 34:06.956
Thank God. He showed me
an expired driver's license.

34:09.132 --> 34:10.626
Dad, what are you doing here?

34:10.800 --> 34:13.550
- Oh, I was in the neighborhood.
- You were?

34:13.759 --> 34:15.583
Your mother and I
had a disagreement...

34:15.760 --> 34:18.165
...on the responsibilities
of being a grandparent.

34:18.469 --> 34:21.302
I'm here to apply for the job
of night nanny.

34:22.969 --> 34:25.376
- What did mom say?
- Use your imagination.

34:25.554 --> 34:27.924
I'd have to come to your apartment.

34:28.179 --> 34:30.632
I mean, I will...

34:30.804 --> 34:33.092
...if you want me to.

34:33.473 --> 34:35.713
Really? You'd do that?

34:36.014 --> 34:38.469
I should've done it a long time ago.

34:47.810 --> 34:50.927
- You taking off?
- I gotta make a run to Humbolt Park.

34:51.101 --> 34:53.971
- Yeah, what for?
- Had a kid with facial paralysis.

34:54.145 --> 34:57.476
I diagnosed Bell's Palsy, but
might've missed vesicles in his ears...

34:57.646 --> 35:00.893
...that suggest Ramsay-Hunt,
and it's been driving me crazy all day.

35:01.063 --> 35:03.979
So I guess this is a no, then?
To my dinner offer?

35:05.189 --> 35:06.848
Would you be paying
for this dinner?

35:07.523 --> 35:10.059
Actually, I thought I'd
be cooking this dinner.

35:12.358 --> 35:16.269
- Know your way around Humbolt Park?
- I can read a map.

35:25.987 --> 35:27.859
Mr. Kazlaw?

35:28.987 --> 35:31.062
Mr. Kazlaw.

35:33.072 --> 35:36.569
I took care of your daughter today,
Mr. Kazlaw.

35:38.115 --> 35:40.651
And I feel terrible because you
overheard something...

35:40.824 --> 35:42.945
...you didn't want or need
to hear right now.

35:43.116 --> 35:45.321
I'm so very sorry.

35:46.409 --> 35:48.199
I don't know what to do.

35:48.409 --> 35:50.780
There are people who can help.
You should talk-

35:57.078 --> 35:59.116
Take this, please.

36:11.749 --> 36:14.155
- No sign of him?
- Nope.

36:14.458 --> 36:16.165
Isn't this dandy.

36:17.167 --> 36:18.494
Give him five more minutes.

36:18.667 --> 36:21.203
If he doesn't show,
we'll make some sort of an excuse.

36:21.376 --> 36:25.667
Say he's out scouring the sewers
for lost kids and stray pets.

36:28.962 --> 36:30.371
Are you Dr. Greene?

36:44.633 --> 36:47.335
You're missing
a really bad chicken dinner.

36:47.508 --> 36:48.966
I'm shooting.

36:49.134 --> 36:51.540
Now, you see? You jinxed me.

36:53.843 --> 36:56.130
Hey, Mark. You wanna hear my speech?

36:59.511 --> 37:03.257
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you all very much for this...

37:03.846 --> 37:08.551
...tremendous honor. I wanna take this
opportunity to acknowledge...

37:08.722 --> 37:10.512
...some of my colleagues.

37:11.181 --> 37:13.338
First, David Morgenstern...

37:13.765 --> 37:16.385
...for his stalwart support.

37:16.641 --> 37:19.011
One minute he's stamping
my walking papers...

37:19.642 --> 37:22.759
...and the next he has his face
so far up my butt...

37:23.726 --> 37:27.851
...if he had a moustache,
it would tickle my throat.

37:28.019 --> 37:29.761
Let's not forget Neal Bernstein.

37:29.936 --> 37:32.556
Neal, proof that any idiot
who can nod his head...

37:32.729 --> 37:36.391
...can rise right to the middle
of pediatric medicine.

37:36.563 --> 37:40.143
And last, and definitely not least,
Mark Greene.

37:42.356 --> 37:43.849
Mark...

37:44.565 --> 37:49.520
...the self-righteous-shall-inherit-
the-ER Greene.

37:50.192 --> 37:54.269
Mark the I-am-behind-you-110%...

37:54.443 --> 37:57.607
...but-you-are-out-of-here Greene.

38:04.154 --> 38:08.231
Thank you. Kiss my ass. Good night.
God bless. What do you think?

38:08.530 --> 38:10.735
Is this really how you want
to end your career?

38:10.905 --> 38:13.146
Can you think of a better way?

38:14.907 --> 38:18.024
- What did your father want?
- You got me.

38:18.199 --> 38:21.945
I'll tell you something. He'd get a kick
out of what I'm about to do.

38:22.117 --> 38:24.108
Don't do it, Doug.

38:24.284 --> 38:25.825
Big mistake.

38:25.993 --> 38:29.276
Well, you know
what my father always said?

38:29.702 --> 38:33.614
If you're gonna make a mistake,
make it a big one.

38:38.663 --> 38:40.453
Still sewing?

38:40.622 --> 38:43.241
Thanks for teaching me the staple gun.

38:46.582 --> 38:48.205
Well, good night.

38:51.250 --> 38:53.490
Why didn't you tell me
you were divorced?

38:58.752 --> 39:00.494
Separated.

39:02.586 --> 39:07.209
We haven't had many conversations
lately. At least not civil ones.

39:11.046 --> 39:12.456
Peter.

39:15.923 --> 39:20.416
Al and I had a lot of problems that
had nothing to do with you and me.

39:28.259 --> 39:29.836
Good night.

39:39.679 --> 39:41.670
Slow down!

39:43.055 --> 39:45.176
- I had no idea you were this neurotic.
- What?

39:45.347 --> 39:47.469
Coming out here
to check a kid's ears?

39:47.640 --> 39:50.010
I thought you came to support me,
not ridicule me.

39:50.182 --> 39:52.303
Yeah, but ridiculing you
is so much more fun.

39:52.474 --> 39:53.884
This is it, 218.

39:58.934 --> 40:01.221
Hey, your first house call.

40:01.393 --> 40:04.558
Hi, how are-?
Hey, Wilbur, how's it going?

40:04.727 --> 40:07.561
- You messed up?
- We'll soon find out. Let's take a look.

40:09.354 --> 40:10.811
That's one down.

40:14.105 --> 40:16.143
- Two down. All clear.
- You done?

40:16.314 --> 40:21.056
I'm done. Thank you. And I'm really
sorry to bother you at home.

40:25.483 --> 40:28.600
It was no surprise to me
to see Doug Ross on TV...

40:28.776 --> 40:32.722
...sloshing around in freezing water
trying to save a kid in trouble.

40:32.985 --> 40:36.102
Because in a way,
that's what he does every day.

40:36.486 --> 40:40.895
I don't know any doctor
who cares more for his patients.

40:41.112 --> 40:46.565
I'm proud to present this award
for outstanding community service...

40:46.739 --> 40:50.733
...to a great pediatrician
and a great friend.

40:50.906 --> 40:52.862
Doug Ross.

41:03.910 --> 41:05.368
Thank you.

41:07.786 --> 41:10.785
I'd like to take this opportunity...

41:10.953 --> 41:14.616
...to single out a few people who have...

41:14.788 --> 41:17.786
...influenced my career,
for better or worse.

41:21.331 --> 41:24.780
But I guess you all know who you are
and how I really feel about you.

41:25.541 --> 41:29.535
Perhaps the less said the better.

41:31.751 --> 41:34.702
Thank you for this. Thank you.

41:41.003 --> 41:44.085
It's scary to think that in four months
I'm gonna be a doctor.

41:44.254 --> 41:47.952
I'm not gonna have Residents looking
over my shoulder checking my mistakes.

41:48.213 --> 41:51.165
It's an awesome responsibility,
if you think about it.

41:51.631 --> 41:53.918
- Do we have to talk shop?
- What?

41:54.090 --> 41:57.752
I'm sorry. I just hate to think that
medicine is all we can talk about.

41:57.924 --> 42:01.172
- No. We can talk about something else.
- Well, good.

42:01.342 --> 42:05.253
- Great. You first.
- No, you go first.

42:14.595 --> 42:17.215
Did you do that because you
couldn't think of anything?

42:20.180 --> 42:24.045
At least take your hands
out of your pockets and do it right.

42:39.810 --> 42:42.928
You're not thinking
of doing anything rash, are you?

42:43.103 --> 42:45.936
- You mean like this?
- What are you, crazy?

42:47.813 --> 42:50.811
- Those awards really bounce.
- Must be acrylic.

42:53.606 --> 42:55.763
Thanks for the speech.

42:56.065 --> 42:58.850
Thanks for not giving your first draft.

43:00.524 --> 43:04.140
- I'm an idiot, you know.
- You have your moments.

43:04.317 --> 43:07.518
You know why my old man called me
today? Because he saw me on TV.

43:09.277 --> 43:15.108
I haven't heard that voice in 22 years.

43:15.362 --> 43:17.187
Son of a bitch.

43:20.821 --> 43:23.773
The scary thing is that I'm doing
a pretty good imitation.

43:24.489 --> 43:28.614
Never kept a job more than two years.
Most of the time it was two weeks.

43:30.657 --> 43:33.442
He had a nasty habit of getting drunk...

43:33.616 --> 43:35.903
...and punching out his boss.

43:36.075 --> 43:38.067
Maybe it's just me...

43:38.951 --> 43:42.365
...but I take a dim view
of that particular approach.

43:51.496 --> 43:53.736
So do I still have a job?

43:54.330 --> 43:56.452
If you still want it.

43:59.707 --> 44:02.659
Damn it! Goddamn!

44:05.542 --> 44:07.035
Damn it!

44:07.209 --> 44:08.915
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

44:09.084 --> 44:11.122
What are you doing up there?

44:11.293 --> 44:15.502
- I'm destroying your roof.
- Oh, great. That's just what I need.

44:15.669 --> 44:19.878
No, seriously, I saw
some of these rotting tiles...

44:20.045 --> 44:24.585
...and I figured I'd start pulling them off,
and I think I've ruined your roof.

44:24.755 --> 44:26.581
Well, stop!

44:28.464 --> 44:30.870
- Oh, my God!
- I know, I know.

44:31.048 --> 44:35.458
This is horrible. I figured I could
save you some money on roofing.

44:35.633 --> 44:37.340
I'm sorry.

44:37.508 --> 44:40.840
About what?
Putting a really big hole in my roof?

44:41.343 --> 44:42.800
I...

44:44.094 --> 44:47.045
The roof, the mouth...

44:47.219 --> 44:51.795
Whatever odious behavior
I'm about to commit. All of it.

44:52.596 --> 44:54.219
I'm sorry.

44:56.930 --> 44:59.633
Look, I shouldn't have made you
feel stupid this morning.

45:00.014 --> 45:02.255
Hey, I did that all on my own.

45:02.432 --> 45:05.466
No, I blind-sided you.

45:06.183 --> 45:07.806
Well, that's true.

45:10.559 --> 45:13.427
Well, look, I-
About what you said today...

45:15.310 --> 45:17.301
It doesn't matter to me.

45:17.561 --> 45:19.018
You know what I mean?

45:19.186 --> 45:22.019
I don't think any less of you.

45:26.355 --> 45:28.560
Most of all...

45:29.522 --> 45:32.474
...I'm really glad that it didn't work.

45:38.483 --> 45:40.273
Me too.
