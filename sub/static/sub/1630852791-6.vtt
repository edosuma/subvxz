down to the creek.</i>

<i>[Buck] Willy and Bill need

anything down there?

03:46.193 --> 03:48.060
[Trapper] Oh, yeah!

03:48.062 --> 03:49.595
[Wild Bill] Big old
track buckaroo.

16, 18 inches long, boys.

one right down the creek.

Daggone.

04:02.176 --> 04:04.776
[Buck] Man, that looks like a
Bigfoot highway up through there.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.178
Looking down this creek bed,

04:06.180 --> 04:09.848
you can see there are massive
footprints all over the place.

04:09.850 --> 04:12.017
[Huckleberry] That son of
a bitch... this creek out.

04:12.019 --> 04:14.019
[Buck] We need to
start tracking these prints

04:14.021 --> 04:15.220
and see where they lead.

04:15.222 --> 04:16.488
You guys got anything?

04:17.223 --> 04:19.891
[Willy] Hey,
the water cleared up.

04:19.893 --> 04:21.994
I ain't seeing no more tracks.

04:23.963 --> 04:27.099
About 50 yards back right
there's the last track I seen.

04:27.101 --> 04:29.134
[Buck] How could
it just stop like that?

04:29.136 --> 04:31.303
How can that trail just
go that cold that quick?

04:31.305 --> 04:33.305
Went cold as a damn ice cube.

04:34.407 --> 04:37.075
Guys, I got an idea.

04:37.777 --> 04:39.611
Willy, Bill, come
on up out here.

04:39.613 --> 04:43.048
We may have lost this
Bigfoot's trail, but I have an idea.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.716
<i>Willy and Bill need
to come up here.</i>

04:44.718 --> 04:46.885
This is going to be good.

04:46.887 --> 04:50.789
We believe that there's Bigfoot that just
went right up through this creek, right?

04:50.791 --> 04:52.123
[Willy] Oh, yeah.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.092
Yeah, there ain't no doubt that
a Bigfoot went up through there.

04:54.094 --> 04:55.727
- Trail went cold?
- [Jeff] Yeah.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.095
- [Willy] Yeah.
- [Buck] All right.

04:57.097 --> 04:59.131
What do you guys think
about trying some tree knocks?

04:59.133 --> 05:00.132
[Willy] Yeah.

05:00.134 --> 05:01.199
Oh, yeah.

05:01.201 --> 05:03.101
Maybe we'll get
the action fired back up.

05:03.103 --> 05:05.170
When it comes to getting
the attention of a Bigfoot,

05:05.172 --> 05:08.073
everybody knows you can't
beat a tree knock.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.241
It's worked before.

05:09.243 --> 05:11.276
Hell, yes, it's worked before.

05:11.278 --> 05:13.145
[Buck] So we're going
to grab us some sticks...

05:13.147 --> 05:14.880
and we're going to
light this holler up.

05:14.882 --> 05:15.881
Who wants to try it?

05:15.883 --> 05:17.249
Me, me.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.484
[laughter] Yeah.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.053
- You?
- Let Jeffro knock it out, yeah.

05:21.055 --> 05:22.954
<i>[Jeff] Last time I hit the tree,</i>

05:22.956 --> 05:26.425
there were so many Bigfoot that came
in, it was like a reunion, you remember?

05:32.165 --> 05:33.865
What happened after you woke up?

05:33.867 --> 05:36.501
[laughter]

05:37.403 --> 05:38.737
[Buck] All right,
well, I'll tell you what, give

05:38.739 --> 05:40.238
her a shot, buddy.

05:40.240 --> 05:43.909
Jeff has been itching to do
some tree knocks for a long time.

05:43.911 --> 05:45.410
Get to work, Jeffro.

05:45.412 --> 05:48.146

resident researcher can do.

05:48.148 --> 05:49.247

05:54.288 --> 05:55.921
[Wild] Yeah, show
'em how it's done, Jeffro.

05:55.923 --> 05:57.255

[Jeff] It felt like a
broken guitar string.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.042
- [laughter]
- [Buck] Oh.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.544
I believe it was the G-chord.

When I smacked that tree
and part of that club come back

07:10.063 --> 07:14.266
and hit me in the head, I
heard church bells for a little bit.

07:14.268 --> 07:16.101
That's a lot
harder than it looks.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.279

[Huckleberry]
Ohh, [bleep] you hear that?

08:14.027 --> 08:15.494
[Willy] Yeah, coming from
from right up around there.

08:15.496 --> 08:16.928
[Jeff] Wow.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.730
[Wild Bill] Maybe
a couple 300 yards.

08:18.732 --> 08:20.365
Oh, I don't know,
it sounded like it was that.

08:20.367 --> 08:21.933
- Jeffro, you got anything internal?
- [tree knock]

08:21.935 --> 08:23.468
[Willy]
Oh, there it is again.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.272
[Wild Bill] I'm damn sure it's
a couple tree knocks,

08:27.274 --> 08:29.574
[Jeff] I can't see it, Buck,
but it ain't that far away.

08:29.576 --> 08:31.109
[Wild Bill] Hell, no.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.178
- [tree knock]
- [Willy] Oh, oh, oh, listen.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.379
[Wild Bill] That
was up over there.

08:34.381 --> 08:36.081
[Willy] No, it's up here.
Look, listen.

08:36.083 --> 08:36.748
[Wild Bill] Hell, yeah.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.149
Did that come from over there?

08:38.151 --> 08:40.819
It came straight up the holler right
here. Came straight up the holler.

08:40.821 --> 08:43.255
- [Buck] Oh, yeah.
- [Wild Bill] Are you serious?

08:43.257 --> 08:45.857
Guys, we have two
different Bigfoot in there.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.727
Buck, I think you're right.

08:48.729 --> 08:51.329
[Buck] I think that we have
two Bigfoot in this holler

08:51.331 --> 08:53.832
and we are smack dab
in the middle of both of them.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.066
Yeah, we need to
make a move on this

08:55.068 --> 08:57.235
and see if we can lay
some eyes on Bigfoot.

08:57.237 --> 09:00.238
Okay, okay. Willy,
Bill, you guys go that way.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.840
Jeffro, let's go this way.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.208
- Come on.
- Come on, Bill.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.210
Guys, go slow and easy.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.144
[Willy] We're going to split up.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.312
[Jeff] Hell yeah!

09:07.314 --> 09:08.847
[Willy] ...and each team's
going to work towards

09:08.849 --> 09:11.316
where we heard
these tree knocks.

09:11.318 --> 09:15.086
I'm telling you right now, we're
back on the Bigfoot hunt, baby.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.422
We've got the money
right off the rip on

09:17.424 --> 09:19.257
land of fallen trees,
lucky how we did it.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.325
[Jeff] I know, buddy.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.894
I never dreamed
we'd come in here

09:22.896 --> 09:25.230
and get this much Bigfoot
activity on the first night.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.064
[Jeff] No.

09:26.066 --> 09:29.334
Man, them tree knocks,

09:29.336 --> 09:31.870
it sound like they were right
up over the hill right here.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.605
[Buck] Yeah, not very damn far.

09:33.607 --> 09:35.340
[Willy] Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.576
Son of a bitch,
look at the blood.

09:37.578 --> 09:39.911
Holy hell!

09:39.913 --> 09:42.614
[Willy] Damn,
look at that blood trail.

09:42.616 --> 09:44.983
Something got,
by God, butchered.

09:44.985 --> 09:45.917
[Willy] Look at that [bleep].

09:45.919 --> 09:48.119
Before this tree
knock we heard...

09:48.121 --> 09:50.789
Son of a bitch, there's
a pile of it everywhere.

09:50.791 --> 09:51.957
Damn brother,
we look down there's

09:51.959 --> 09:54.292
a hell of a big pile
of blood on the ground.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.894
[Willy] Oh, yeah,
right there some more.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.596
I don't know what did this,

09:57.598 --> 10:00.198
but by God, it looks like
something's jugular got ripped open.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.133
Damn, look there,
going up through there.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.069
Oh, yeah, there's
some more, right there.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.204
Damn, all over the
place here, holy [bleep].

10:06.206 --> 10:07.305
[Wild Bill] Look
out there, Willy.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.608
[Willy] Oh, right there
on that log, right there too.

10:09.610 --> 10:10.842
<i>[Wild Bill] Go to hell!</i>

10:10.844 --> 10:12.978
[Willy] Man, look at
that log right... Holy [bleep].

10:12.980 --> 10:15.280
[Wild Bill] Son of a bitch.
Look at that.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.948
What the...

10:18.818 --> 10:20.018
[Willy] Look at that.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.319
[Wild Bill] Carnage.

10:24.090 --> 10:28.393
What the hell
just killed this cow?

10:30.696 --> 10:32.163
[Willy] Hey, look there,
going up through there.

10:32.165 --> 10:33.999
[Wild Bill] Oh, yeah,
there's some more right there.

10:34.001 --> 10:35.100
Damn, all over the place here,
holy [bleep].

10:35.102 --> 10:36.401
Look out there, Willy.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.103
[Willy] Oh, right there
on that log right there, too.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.771
[Wild Bill] Go to hell!

10:39.773 --> 10:42.040
[Willy] Man, look at this log,
right... Holy [bleep].

10:42.042 --> 10:44.609
[Wild Bill] Son of a bitch.
Look at that.

10:44.611 --> 10:45.944
[Willy] What the...

10:48.147 --> 10:49.014
Look at that!

10:49.016 --> 10:50.281
Carnage.

10:53.119 --> 10:57.222
What the hell
just killed this cow?

10:57.224 --> 11:01.693
<i>[Wild Bill] We're following
this blood trail, holy hell,</i>

11:01.695 --> 11:03.928
there's damn cow parts
lying everywhere.

11:03.930 --> 11:08.066
[Willy] Man, there's the
liver, lungs, part of the hide.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.568
It even ripped the
damn head clean off of it.

11:12.138 --> 11:14.305
A cow killing bastard.

11:14.307 --> 11:18.209
Hell, it looks like it got thrown into a
damn wood chipper and ground up.

11:18.211 --> 11:21.079
This cow even got decapitated.

11:22.048 --> 11:24.783
Look, it's blood's
fresh as hell, bud.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.451
That cow just got killed.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.620
[Willy] Let me
radio and tell Buck.

11:28.622 --> 11:29.754
Buck?

11:29.756 --> 11:31.189
[Buck] Yeah, Willy?

11:31.191 --> 11:34.225
[Willy] We just found
what's left of a mutilated cow

11:34.227 --> 11:36.494
and I'm talking about mutilated.

11:38.197 --> 11:39.697
No way.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.267
[Buck] Okay, Willy, you guys hang
tight. We're going to come that way.

11:42.269 --> 11:44.936
[Willy] We need the rest of
the team to get over here,

11:44.938 --> 11:46.604
and they sure as hell needs
to check this out.

11:46.606 --> 11:47.705
Willy?

11:47.707 --> 11:49.607
[Willy] Hey, hey, down here,
down here. Come on.

11:49.609 --> 11:51.342
I don't think
they're going to believe this

11:51.344 --> 11:53.945
until they see it
with their own eyes.

11:54.947 --> 11:58.083
- Daggone.
- Son of a bitch.

11:58.085 --> 12:01.252
My God, what happened to that?

12:01.254 --> 12:03.421
[Buck] I've never
seen anything like this.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.657
The hide's peeled
completely off the head.

12:05.659 --> 12:06.791
Yeah.

12:06.793 --> 12:10.328
Oh yeah, something done
mutilated this [bleep] cow.

12:13.599 --> 12:16.568
We know the Grafton
monster has been killing cattle.

12:19.038 --> 12:21.339
We've got a cow killer in here.

12:23.109 --> 12:26.978
Brad said he believes
that the Bigfoot he saw

12:26.980 --> 12:28.513
had been killing cattle too.

12:28.515 --> 12:30.215
I found what was
left of the cow.

12:32.818 --> 12:36.788
There are some serious monsters
in these Tygart Valley Hills.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.690
You're talking
about an eight, 900-pound cow.

12:38.692 --> 12:40.125
[Buck] Every bit of it.

12:40.127 --> 12:42.827
And we need to be on our game
or else we're going to end up

12:42.829 --> 12:44.896
just like this cow.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.331
Jeff, I hate to add
to your workload, brother,

12:46.333 --> 12:49.000
but you will have to line us
up some more eyewitnesses

12:49.002 --> 12:50.902
because we have to learn
as much as we can

12:50.904 --> 12:53.004
about the Bigfoot here
in the Tygart Valley.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.839
- Yeah.
- Hell, yes.

12:54.841 --> 12:55.874
I'm on it.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.876
Our next step
is to get out of here--

12:57.878 --> 13:01.980
Willy, get up that wood. and
try to contact some locals.

13:01.982 --> 13:05.717
We need to find out everything
we can about the Bigfoot that

13:05.719 --> 13:08.086
call the Tygart
Valley their home.

13:09.488 --> 13:11.422
[Wild Bill] Anybody in the
mood for any hamburgers?

13:11.424 --> 13:15.860
[laughter]

13:15.862 --> 13:18.096
[Willy] No, thank you.

13:23.068 --> 13:24.836
[Buck] Looks like him out there.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.337
[Buck] <i>Today we're about
to meet with a local here</i>

13:26.339 --> 13:28.606
<i>in the Tygart Valley named Jim.</i>

13:28.608 --> 13:29.974
[Huckleberry] Hey.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.142
[Jim] Hey,
how are you doing today?

13:31.144 --> 13:33.211
<i>[Buck] We're looking to
find out everything we can</i>

13:33.213 --> 13:36.848
about all the creatures that roam
these hills in the Tygart Valley.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.149
-Huckleberry
-Jim.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.084
We believe
he may have some information

13:40.086 --> 13:42.253
<i>on this Bigfoot
that we're after.</i>

13:42.255 --> 13:45.223
It looks like you've got a pretty
good size piece of property here

13:45.225 --> 13:48.159
and a nice little junkyard,
it's pretty interesting.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.461
Well, I have sixty acres and
a bunch of junk from the farm

13:50.463 --> 13:51.996
we don't use anymore.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.598
Hey, one man's junk
is another man's treasure.

13:53.600 --> 13:54.899
Hell, yeah.

13:54.901 --> 13:56.167
I have all the
treasure you want.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.036
[laughter]

13:58.038 --> 14:00.038
- I love treasure.
- Oh, yeah.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.573
Willy at a junkyard
that's about like

14:01.575 --> 14:03.074
a man at a gentlemen's club.

14:03.076 --> 14:05.343
[all laughing]

14:05.345 --> 14:06.611
Which one do I look at?

14:06.613 --> 14:08.213
- [laughter]
- [Huckleberry] Yeah.

14:09.014 --> 14:10.949
[Buck] God, she's a beauty boy.

14:10.951 --> 14:13.017
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.887
[Huckleberry] Willy, you're going
to get a lap dance from over there,

14:15.889 --> 14:17.956
you probably ought to
get you a tetanus shot.

14:17.958 --> 14:21.359
[laughter]

14:24.597 --> 14:26.431
<i>[Buck] Well, Jimmy,
the reason we're out here is</i>

14:26.433 --> 14:29.767
we're hot on the trail of a
Bigfoot here in the Tygart Valley.

14:29.769 --> 14:31.936
Oh, yes, we are.

14:31.938 --> 14:33.972
From what we was told,
you had a pretty interesting

14:33.974 --> 14:35.740
encounter of what
you think is a Bigfoot.

14:35.742 --> 14:37.508
Yeah, I think you guys
are in the right place.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.143
Well, would you mind
telling us about it?

14:39.145 --> 14:42.747
Well, I've been hearing the
stories around here about 20 years.

14:42.749 --> 14:44.115
All the old-timers
around here, they say,

14:44.117 --> 14:46.184
"Don't go in the woods
after dark,

14:46.186 --> 14:48.286
you're going to run into the
woolly jigger, he'll get you."

14:49.355 --> 14:50.922
[Buck] Woolly jigger?

14:50.924 --> 14:51.890
Well, that's what they call it.

14:51.892 --> 14:53.558
[Huckleberry] Uh?

14:53.560 --> 14:55.393
I don't know where they come up with
that name, but that's what they call it.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.962
Some of them old timers, they
can come up with some good ones.

14:57.964 --> 14:59.030
[Jim] Oh, yes, they do.

14:59.032 --> 15:01.099
They said it's
five, six foot tall.

15:01.101 --> 15:03.034
It's covered in
brownish red fur.

15:03.036 --> 15:05.103
It's got teeth, big old teeth.

15:05.105 --> 15:08.273
They stink something awful
when you're close to it.

15:08.275 --> 15:11.142
I never believed a word up
until about a week ago.

15:13.279 --> 15:15.480
I was messing around
over there in the junk,

15:15.482 --> 15:17.749
getting an old truck
ready to haul off.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.117
It's gone now.

15:19.119 --> 15:21.853
I'm messing around with it.
It's dark.

15:21.855 --> 15:25.490
I heard something, kind of
looked down there in the woods,

15:25.492 --> 15:29.327
right there in the trees, a cat.

15:29.329 --> 15:30.895
A cat?

15:30.897 --> 15:34.232
A cat. An orange
cat about this big.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.167
And I'm not talking about a
cat that you're going to take

15:36.169 --> 15:38.169
to grandma's and put
this in your house.

15:38.171 --> 15:39.837
This thing's butt ugly.

15:39.839 --> 15:41.039
He's missing half his lip.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.440
He's got an ear completely gone.

15:42.442 --> 15:45.810
Looks like he's fought a battle
for every meal that he's ever had.

15:45.812 --> 15:47.812
- Wow.
- [Jim] Huh!

15:47.814 --> 15:52.317
About that time, I look up and
I see these two orange lights.

15:53.852 --> 15:55.720
They start moving.

15:55.722 --> 15:58.523
They're going up and
down, up and down.

15:59.358 --> 16:02.627
I realize them ain't
lights, they're eyeballs.

16:02.629 --> 16:03.962
[Huckleberry] Ooh!

16:04.830 --> 16:05.863
[Willy] Wow.

16:05.865 --> 16:07.065
[Jim] That's when I knew it.

16:07.599 --> 16:08.866
The old-timers are right.

16:08.868 --> 16:10.301
There's something out here.

16:11.904 --> 16:13.805
They call it the woolly jigger.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.540
I think it's Bigfoot.

16:16.875 --> 16:19.844
[Huckleberry] Yeah,
I believe you're right, bud.

16:19.846 --> 16:22.213
[Buck] Wow.

16:22.215 --> 16:26.017
[Jim] I let out a scream
that will curl your hair.

16:26.118 --> 16:28.319
[Buck] Daggone.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.188
[Huckleberry] Just how close
to this thing was you

16:30.190 --> 16:31.322
when it screamed at you?

16:31.324 --> 16:32.924
[Jim] About from where
I'm standing,

16:32.926 --> 16:34.292
that tire right there
on the ground.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.227
- [Huckleberry] That big one?
<i>- [Jim] Yeah.</i>

16:37.062 --> 16:38.596
[Huckleberry] Holy [bleep].

16:38.598 --> 16:41.933
[Jim] Once that thing
screamed, I bailed with my truck,

16:41.935 --> 16:43.968
took off out of here
and that's the last time

16:43.970 --> 16:46.270
I've been down in
this area close to dark.

16:46.272 --> 16:48.373
[Huckleberry] You can
still tell you're shook up.

16:48.375 --> 16:51.242
[Jim] Oh yeah, every
time I come down here,

16:52.011 --> 16:56.547
I start shaking,
even in daytime.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.118
[Huckleberry] Wow,
that's hell of an encounter.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.019
[Jim] I think so.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.387
[Huckleberry]
<i>Looking at Jimmy,</i>

17:02.955 --> 17:05.957
<i>you can tell, this man is
shook to the core to this day.</i>

17:05.959 --> 17:08.059
<i>That encounter he had out here</i>

17:08.061 --> 17:10.261
will stay with him
the rest of his life.

17:10.263 --> 17:12.330
[Jim] I don't mess around
down here anymore.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.966
It's getting toward dark,
I'm out of here.

17:14.968 --> 17:16.067
[Huckleberry]
And that's what happens,

17:16.069 --> 17:18.102
when you see
a Bigfoot in person,

17:18.104 --> 17:21.706
I don't give a damn
how big bad you think you are.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.242
It'll put you in your place.

17:24.244 --> 17:27.278
[Buck] So Jimmy, you
said you've seen this thing

17:27.280 --> 17:28.980
right back down in there, right?

17:28.982 --> 17:31.849
[Buck] This junk pile is
kind of obstructing the view.

17:31.851 --> 17:34.585
You care if we walk right over
here and take a better look?

17:34.587 --> 17:35.720
[Jim] Go right ahead.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.154
[Buck] Well, you lead the way.

17:37.156 --> 17:39.857
<i>Jimmy is going to take us over
to where he had his encounter.</i>

17:39.859 --> 17:41.159
<i>I'd like to see
it a little closer.</i>

17:41.161 --> 17:43.027
I want to get a better eye
of where it was at.

17:43.029 --> 17:46.264
[Jim] If you guys want to
follow me, I'll show you up here.

17:46.266 --> 17:48.966
<i>[Buck] My gut's telling me, if we
wasn't out here with Jimmy right now,</i>

17:48.968 --> 17:50.802
he wouldn't be here.

17:50.804 --> 17:53.271
I don't think that man has any
desire to come back to this place.

17:54.139 --> 17:57.275
Okay, so right about
where did you see it?

17:57.277 --> 17:58.743
[Jim] Right past that brush pile

17:58.745 --> 18:00.378
where that tree forks off.

18:01.780 --> 18:05.116
[Buck] That brush pile looks
like it would be a dandy nest.

18:05.118 --> 18:06.617
-[Huckleberry] It does, doesn't it?
-[Buck] It does.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.186
[Jeff] Sure.

18:08.188 --> 18:10.088
[Jim] It might look like it, but
that's just brush from the farm.

18:10.090 --> 18:13.624
But I've had a bunch of hunter friends
of mine tell me right down in there,

18:13.626 --> 18:15.760
there's a big pile,
looks similar to that,

18:15.762 --> 18:17.261
they say that's where that
thing comes from.

18:17.263 --> 18:18.896
- [Buck] Really?
- [Jim] Yep.

18:18.898 --> 18:20.565
It looks like a big nest
or something.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.266
[Buck] A nest?

18:25.571 --> 18:27.171
<i>[Jim] I've had a bunch of
hunter friends of mine tell me,</i>

18:27.173 --> 18:29.307
right down in there, there's a
big pile, looks similar to that,

18:29.309 --> 18:31.008
they say that's where
that thing comes from.

18:31.010 --> 18:32.543
- [Buck] Really?
- [Jim] Yeah.

18:32.545 --> 18:33.878
It looks like
a big nest or something.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.413
[Buck] Down in this holler?

18:35.415 --> 18:37.215
[Jim] From what I understand,
that's what they've been telling me.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.850
You go down that way.

18:38.852 --> 18:40.384
I don't know
if it's down there or not.

18:40.386 --> 18:41.819
I'm not going down there.

18:41.821 --> 18:44.222
[Jeff] We sure as hell found some
Bigfoot nests before, haven't we?

18:44.224 --> 18:45.289
[Huckleberry] Oh, yeah.
[Buck] Yes, we have.

18:45.291 --> 18:46.858
Yes, we absolutely have.

18:46.860 --> 18:48.926
<i>[Huckleberry] This team,
we're no strangers</i>

18:48.928 --> 18:50.895
<i>when it comes to these
Bigfoot nests.</i>

18:50.897 --> 18:54.265
We found a Bigfoot nest when
we was going after the grass man.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.135
What the hell is this, guys?

18:57.137 --> 18:58.903
Yeah, this is definitely
his nest.

18:58.905 --> 19:02.140
We found a massive nest
right there in Central Kentucky.

19:02.608 --> 19:04.308
It's a nest!

19:05.077 --> 19:06.611
Whoa!

19:06.613 --> 19:09.113
Whoa! This place is huge.

19:09.115 --> 19:11.582
If you can find
where a Bigfoot's nesting up,

19:11.584 --> 19:14.452
buddy, you just hit the jackpot.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.054
Boys, we need to find that nest.

19:17.289 --> 19:18.589
Oh, yeah, we do.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.725
Jeffro, you're going to have
to talk to some of his buddies,

19:20.727 --> 19:21.759
some of his hunting buddies.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.494
All right,
I'll get on that, Buck.

19:23.496 --> 19:26.998
[Buck] Jimmy, we really appreciate
you sharing your encounter with us.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.300
I think what we're going to do
is get out of here and cipher out

19:29.302 --> 19:31.802
what our next
move is going to be.

19:31.804 --> 19:34.005
- [Jim] Sounds good to me.
- [Buck] Appreciate it, buddy.

19:34.007 --> 19:36.007
<i>It's time for our resident
researcher, Jeff,</i>

19:36.009 --> 19:38.176
to get this investigation
kicked into high gear.

19:38.178 --> 19:39.610
[Jeff]
We'll jump right up in line.

19:39.612 --> 19:40.811
[Willy] Keep an eye on
you, big boy.

19:40.813 --> 19:42.180
[Jeff] Yeah,
I'm getting out of here.

19:42.182 --> 19:43.948
[Buck] He needs to reach out
to these local hunters

19:43.950 --> 19:44.982
and get us some information.

19:44.984 --> 19:47.618
It's time for him
to earn his meal.

19:47.620 --> 19:50.087
[Buck] From what it sounded
like we've got a nest to locate.

19:50.089 --> 19:51.389
[Huckleberry] Oh yeah.

19:56.228 --> 19:59.096
[Willy] Jeffro, you knocked
it out of the park this time.

19:59.098 --> 20:00.398
[Wild Bill]
Hell yeah, brother.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.000
Done a damn
good job, didn't you?

20:03.002 --> 20:04.035
[indistinct chatter]

20:04.037 --> 20:06.170
[Huckleberry] Come on.

20:06.172 --> 20:07.872
[Buck] Come on,
Bill, get them in there.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.875
[Willy] Right here,
brother, move in here.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.376
<i>[Huckleberry] Jeff
got hold of Buck and me,</i>

20:12.378 --> 20:15.313
he said he has some
information about that Bigfoot nest

20:15.315 --> 20:16.647
that we need to hear.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.149
[Wild Bill]
Woke us up.

20:18.151 --> 20:21.018
[Willy] Hey, can't be worth
getting woke up. Trust me.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.587
Yeah [bleep] wait
till you see this.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.388
[Willy] Hell, yeah.

20:24.390 --> 20:25.856
<i>[Huckleberry] Yeah, I don't know
what he's got, but it better be good.</i>

20:25.858 --> 20:27.992
He woke me up out
of my damn beauty sleep.

20:27.994 --> 20:29.594
[Jeff] Come and look at this.

20:29.596 --> 20:31.329
[Huckleberry] And to
stay looking this good,

20:31.331 --> 20:33.531
it takes time, trust me.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.266
[Buck] All right, Jeff,
what do you got, bud?

20:35.268 --> 20:38.169
[Jeff] Well, I talked to Jimmy
and I called some of his friends.

20:38.171 --> 20:40.037
I talked to three or four guys.

20:40.039 --> 20:43.541
From a friend to another
friend, I got us a video.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.243
- [Buck] Really?
- [Jeff] Yeah, man.

20:45.245 --> 20:46.344
Feast your eyes on this.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.145
[Jeff] Oh God,
you've got to see this, man.

20:48.147 --> 20:50.414
- Check this out.
- This is badass.

20:52.317 --> 20:53.584
[Buck] Ohh!

20:53.586 --> 20:56.087
[Wild Bill] Look how
big this bastard is.

20:56.089 --> 20:58.322
[Buck] It's so big and huge.

20:59.224 --> 21:01.792
[Willy]
Look at the size of that.

21:01.794 --> 21:04.895
[Wild Bill] Damn, it's got to be
the biggest nest we've ever seen.

21:04.897 --> 21:08.199
[Huckleberry] Looking at that
video, there's no doubt about it,

21:08.201 --> 21:10.901
<i>there's a Bigfoot Nest
in this hollow.</i>

21:10.903 --> 21:12.503
[Huckleberry] What do you of
think the size of that nest, boys?

21:12.505 --> 21:13.938
[Buck] Look at that.

21:13.940 --> 21:16.407
[Huckleberry] We've seen quite a
few of them down through the years.

21:16.409 --> 21:18.709
I believe you could
put every one we've found

21:18.711 --> 21:20.978
right inside
that son of a bitch.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.581
- [Jeff] Now watch.
- [Buck] My gosh!

21:23.583 --> 21:25.016
[Jeff] Watch, watch
this guy, right here.

21:25.018 --> 21:26.550
<i>[Willy] Watch this,
right here. Listen. listen.</i>

21:31.223 --> 21:32.590
<i>[Wild Bill] Oh, what was that?</i>

21:32.592 --> 21:33.924
[Huckleberry]
<i>No, it's right back in there.</i>

21:33.926 --> 21:36.961
<i>[Wild Bill] Here,
oh, I hear something running.</i>

21:36.963 --> 21:38.195
<i>[Willy] Yeah, yeah.</i>

21:38.363 --> 21:40.364
<i>[Buck] Well, there he goes.
[Willy] Yeah, he's running.</i>

21:41.033 --> 21:42.733
[Buck] Man, he is scooting.

21:42.735 --> 21:44.602
[Wild Bill] The bridge up
there. Look at that bridge.

21:44.604 --> 21:46.370
<i>[Willy] Yeah, yeah,
he's hauling ass out of there.</i>

21:46.372 --> 21:48.606
Man, we thought
there was a Bigfoot nest.

21:48.608 --> 21:50.975
[indistinct chatter]

21:53.278 --> 21:55.846
[Buck] So my big question is
when you talked to these guys,

21:55.848 --> 21:57.715
did they give you a location?

21:57.717 --> 22:00.217
[Jeff] No, they were
tight lipped about that.

22:00.219 --> 22:04.822
I don't know where it's at, but
I think I have a general idea.

22:04.824 --> 22:07.124
Man, it's absolutely awesome
that there's a Bigfoot nest

22:07.126 --> 22:09.126
<i>right out here in these woods.</i>

22:09.128 --> 22:12.163
But trying to locate it out
here in the Tygart Valley...

22:12.165 --> 22:13.831
We've got to
find that nest, guys.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.700
thousands
of vast acreage,

22:15.702 --> 22:17.234
this is going to be a challenge.

22:17.236 --> 22:19.270
There's definitely
a Bigfoot nest out there.

22:19.272 --> 22:21.205
[Willy] Oh, hell yeah.

22:21.207 --> 22:23.974
[Buck] We've got to
get creative to find this.

22:23.976 --> 22:26.177
We're going to have to come up
with a creative way

22:26.179 --> 22:27.845
<i>to narrow down this location.</i>

22:27.847 --> 22:29.213
<i>We just go hump in the hills,</i>

22:29.215 --> 22:31.582
it's going to be like looking
for a needle in the haystack.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.184
[Buck] All right,
Jeff, good job, Jeff.

22:33.186 --> 22:35.186
[Willy] Good job, Jeffro.

22:35.188 --> 22:36.821
- [Huckleberry] Yeah.
- [Willy] Hell yeah.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.823
[Buck] All right, guys,
let's get out of here.

22:38.825 --> 22:42.059
Our next step, we need
to head out tomorrow...

22:42.061 --> 22:43.194
Great job, buddy.

22:43.196 --> 22:45.796
and find some damn
way to find this Bigfoot nest.

22:45.798 --> 22:47.598
[Huckleberry] Hell yeah,
Jeffro, good job dude.

22:47.600 --> 22:48.699
[Jeff] Oh, I'm stoked
about this one.

22:48.701 --> 22:51.635
[Buck] That's right, yes.

22:56.274 --> 22:58.342
[Buck] I don't think Colt knows
what he's getting himself into today.

22:58.344 --> 23:00.044
[laughter]

23:00.046 --> 23:03.147
[Buck] After seeing the video
of that Bigfoot nest last night,

23:05.050 --> 23:06.617
we've got a dandy idea.

23:06.619 --> 23:08.452
[Willy] I guarantee
he's nervous.

23:08.454 --> 23:09.754
[Buck] He should be.

23:09.756 --> 23:11.989
[laughter]

23:11.991 --> 23:13.924
[Buck] It's a little
outside the box, but hey,

23:13.926 --> 23:17.128
whenever it comes to Bigfoot,
you've got to be creative.

23:17.130 --> 23:18.095
<i>[Willy] There he comes.</i>

23:18.097 --> 23:20.097
[cheering]

23:20.465 --> 23:21.932
[Buck] He brought Cowboy Ken.

23:26.905 --> 23:29.407
<i>[Buck] We asked our producer,
Colt, to meet us out here today,</i>

23:29.409 --> 23:31.409
and we asked him to bring
Cowboy Ken.

23:31.411 --> 23:33.144
Cowboy Ken, good to see you.

23:33.146 --> 23:34.412
[Cowboy Ken] Good to see you.

23:34.414 --> 23:35.946
<i>[Buck] I'll tell you something
about Cowboy Ken.</i>

23:35.948 --> 23:38.082
<i>He is a tech wizard.</i>

23:38.084 --> 23:41.485
This man, I'm pretty
sure he invented NASA.

23:42.354 --> 23:43.988
[Colt] All right, all right.

23:43.990 --> 23:45.322
[laughter]

23:45.324 --> 23:48.092
[Colt] Oh, man, what have
these guys got up their sleeve?

23:48.094 --> 23:50.127
[laughter]

23:51.830 --> 23:53.030
[Buck] Hi.

23:53.032 --> 23:55.032
[laughter]

23:55.034 --> 23:56.367
[Buck] Good to see you.

23:56.369 --> 23:58.169
[Colt] So, guys,

23:58.171 --> 24:00.070
what have you got in store here?

24:00.072 --> 24:03.941
[Buck] Well, you've seen that
video of that Bigfoot nest.

24:03.943 --> 24:06.043
[Wild Bill] Look how big
that bastard is.

24:06.045 --> 24:07.311
- Yeah.
- That son of a bitch...

24:07.313 --> 24:08.813
[bleep]

24:08.815 --> 24:10.614
- A hell of a nest.
- Hell, yeah. Flopper.

24:10.616 --> 24:12.016
We don't know exactly

24:12.018 --> 24:15.219
where that hunter took the
video of that Bigfoot nest.

24:15.221 --> 24:18.756
We have a general location,
but nothing concrete.

24:18.758 --> 24:20.024
Gotcha.

24:20.026 --> 24:24.261
So we was thinking maybe
we could borrow the drone?

24:24.963 --> 24:25.963
Borrow the drone?

24:25.965 --> 24:27.164
[all] Yeah.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.033
[Colt] Now you've got it.

24:29.035 --> 24:31.101
After seeing that video that
Jeff showed us last night,

24:31.103 --> 24:33.704
<i>we know there's
a Bigfoot nest out here.</i>

24:33.706 --> 24:38.742
The problem is Tygart Valley is
thousands of acres of rough terrain.

24:38.744 --> 24:40.845
So, you guys, you guys
actually want to use the drone

24:40.847 --> 24:42.246
to sort of start scout and
see if you can find that nest?

24:42.248 --> 24:43.414
[Willy] Yes.

24:43.416 --> 24:44.582
- [Jeff] Yeah.
- [Wild Bill] Yeah.

24:44.584 --> 24:45.950
All right. Okay.

24:45.952 --> 24:49.119
Our thought is if we get Cowboy
Ken to get that drone aerial,

24:49.121 --> 24:52.456
then we'll be able to cover a lot of ground
a lot quicker than we can on our feet.

24:52.458 --> 24:55.359
I'll tell you what, boys, this is
outside the box, but I'm liking it.

24:55.361 --> 24:57.061
Is that a yes?

24:57.063 --> 24:59.029
- Ken?
- Oh, absolutely, man.

24:59.031 --> 25:01.165
[all cheering]

25:02.300 --> 25:03.701
All right.

25:03.703 --> 25:06.203
Good deal.

25:06.205 --> 25:09.139
[Buck] That actually went
a lot better than I expected.

25:09.141 --> 25:10.875
Glad we didn't have to
beat him up and take it.

25:10.877 --> 25:12.009
[laughter]

25:12.011 --> 25:14.078
[Buck]
<i>Colt's a good dude.</i>

25:14.080 --> 25:18.182
If I was him, ain't no way in this
world I'd let us borrow that drone.

25:18.184 --> 25:19.483
Good thing Ken's here.

25:22.587 --> 25:26.090
<i>[Wild Bill] Top locations,
we will check out this drone,</i>

25:26.092 --> 25:29.326
gonna head out this field, get
her airborne, get some miles on.

25:29.328 --> 25:32.763
<i>[Huckleberry] It'll be nice to get
that drone up in the air, won't it?</i>

25:32.765 --> 25:33.864
[Wild Bill]
Tell you right now,

25:33.866 --> 25:36.267
we're gonna spot ourselves
a Bigfoot nest.

25:36.269 --> 25:38.769
Look at the big ass pines
right there.

25:38.771 --> 25:40.271
- Oh, yeah.
- [Willy] Hold it, hold it.

25:41.806 --> 25:42.973
- Right there.
- [Jeff] Oh, yeah, yeah.

25:42.975 --> 25:44.742
[Wild Bill] Yeah,
see them pine trees?

25:44.744 --> 25:46.477
- [Cowboy Ken] [bleep] Yeah.
- [Wild Bill] Oh, yes.

25:46.479 --> 25:47.945
They're full, big and dry here.

25:47.947 --> 25:50.281
Bunch up.. all
the big row right there.

25:50.283 --> 25:52.883
Right here at these pine
trees is the place to start.

25:52.885 --> 25:55.052
[Buck] <i>One thing I
noticed on that nest,</i>

25:55.054 --> 25:59.056
it looks like the outer layer
is covered in pine needles.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.759
<i>[Wild Bill] This is got to be the
biggest nest we've ever seen, ain't it?</i>

26:01.761 --> 26:03.727
So we're going to start
at the edge of this field

26:03.729 --> 26:05.229
right by a whole pile
of pine trees.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.331
I think that'd be a great
place to start looking.

26:07.333 --> 26:09.199
What do you say, Cowboy Ken,

26:09.201 --> 26:10.968
we'll get your drone airborne?

26:10.970 --> 26:13.370
[cheering]

26:13.372 --> 26:16.173
[Buck] We're bringing monster
hunting to 21st century.

26:16.175 --> 26:17.374
All powered up.

26:17.376 --> 26:19.810
Oh, you've got to
let me see that, brother.

26:19.812 --> 26:20.978
Yeah, let me, let me...

26:20.980 --> 26:22.613
All right, Bill, you can
hold it. You can hold it.

26:22.615 --> 26:24.882
Just hold-- Repeat after me.
I'm just holding it.

26:24.884 --> 26:26.817
- I'm just holding it.
- Okay.

26:26.819 --> 26:27.818
[Jeff] Don't do it, Ken.

26:27.820 --> 26:29.520
[indistinct chatter]

26:33.024 --> 26:35.960
<i>[Huckleberry] Man, I'm
telling you, Bill loves that drone.</i>

26:35.962 --> 26:38.195
He looks like a kid on Christmas
every time he gets near it.

26:38.197 --> 26:40.664
[Wild Bill] Oh, this
is sweet brother.

26:40.666 --> 26:43.400
[Huckleberry] His eyes light
up and get big as saucers,

26:43.402 --> 26:46.904
and he smiles so big you
can see his one good tooth.

26:46.906 --> 26:49.039
This thing is awesome, huh?

26:49.041 --> 26:50.941
I can just feel the power.
[grunts]

26:50.943 --> 26:53.077
[all laughing]

26:54.012 --> 26:56.347
I'm telling you right now,
you can't beat technology.

26:56.349 --> 26:58.082
Let her rip, Cowboy Ken.

26:58.084 --> 27:00.985
I can feel the breeze, boys.
Yeah!

27:00.987 --> 27:02.019
[Cowboy Ken] All right.

27:02.021 --> 27:03.053
Oh, yeah.

27:03.055 --> 27:05.155
[laughter and cheering]

27:05.690 --> 27:07.157
[Cowboy Ken] All right.

27:07.292 --> 27:10.728
[Buck] All right, Cowboy Ken,
send her right over top of those pines.

27:10.730 --> 27:11.895
[Cowboy Ken] Got you.

27:11.897 --> 27:14.264
<i>[Buck] If there's a nest
out there, Cowboy Ken,</i>

27:14.266 --> 27:15.566
<i>he's going to find it.</i>

27:15.568 --> 27:17.034
I bet you that man can find

27:17.036 --> 27:20.604
a gnat on a deer's rear end at a
1,000 yards away with that drone.

27:20.606 --> 27:23.007
Jeff, in that video you had,
you could see a side-by-side trail.

27:23.009 --> 27:25.309
It looks like it
was right by the nest.

27:27.545 --> 27:30.714
Could you look on there and see if
you can find any side-by-side trails?

27:30.716 --> 27:33.350
<i>[Wild Bill] I can see some pines
out in that corner right there.</i>

27:33.352 --> 27:37.454
Yeah, can you go to the right
over there towards those pines?

27:37.456 --> 27:39.690
[Jeff] Man, when the hunters
were talking about that being thick,

27:39.692 --> 27:41.592
I couldn't imagine
it would be like that.

27:41.594 --> 27:43.927
Well, if I lived in the woods,
that's where I'd be at.

27:43.929 --> 27:45.329
<i>[Jeff] Oh, yeah.</i>

27:45.331 --> 27:47.031
[Huckleberry] <i>Good
point, brother. Yes, sir.</i>

27:47.033 --> 27:50.401
Anyone ever tell you guys
you have an interesting smell?

27:50.935 --> 27:52.536
[laughter]

27:52.871 --> 27:54.304
Move away.

27:55.273 --> 27:59.877
Cowboy Ken said
this team has a unique odor.

27:59.879 --> 28:01.578
<i>I know what he's talking about.</i>

28:01.580 --> 28:03.781
I call it hillbilly cologne.

28:03.783 --> 28:08.352
It's a mixture of beer,
sweat, sauerkraut.

28:08.354 --> 28:10.254
You know
what that is, don't you?

28:10.256 --> 28:11.855
- Yeah.
- It's bull crap.

28:11.857 --> 28:13.290
[laughter]

28:14.192 --> 28:15.559
And we're all full of it.

28:15.561 --> 28:17.027
I mean, look at me,

28:17.029 --> 28:20.097
did you really think I smell
like a bunch of daisies?

28:20.099 --> 28:21.198
Oh, right there, right there.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.367
<i>[Willy] Yeah, zoom in.</i>

28:23.369 --> 28:25.069
<i>[Cowboy Ken] Let me drop it
down a little bit.</i>

28:25.071 --> 28:26.136
<i>Bring it down.</i>

28:26.138 --> 28:27.304
<i>Careful.</i>

28:28.573 --> 28:29.640
<i>Yeah, can you --</i>

28:29.708 --> 28:31.075
<i>I thought that was
the side-by-side trails,</i>

28:31.077 --> 28:32.042
<i>it's just a little right
of wood.</i>

28:32.044 --> 28:33.243
<i>That ain't it.</i>

28:33.245 --> 28:34.812
Man, look at that giant red oak.

28:34.814 --> 28:35.813
That's an old one.

28:35.815 --> 28:37.214
[Huckleberry]
<i>That son of a bitch is huge,</i>

28:37.216 --> 28:38.882
<i>look at them
big old limbs on it.</i>

28:38.884 --> 28:41.018
Bunch of poplars up
around the corner.

28:41.020 --> 28:43.420
- [indistinct screaming]
- Oh, what the hell was that?

28:43.422 --> 28:45.255
- [Buck] Damn!
- Did you hear that [bleep]?

28:45.257 --> 28:46.290
Oh, yeah.

28:46.292 --> 28:47.858
Sounded like a scream.

28:47.860 --> 28:48.892
That thing screamed
over somewhere.

28:48.894 --> 28:50.394
<i>[Buck] We're standing there.</i>

28:50.396 --> 28:53.397
All of a sudden we hear what
sounds like a high-pitched scream

28:53.399 --> 28:54.998
right out in the timber.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.633
[Jeff] Right over in there.

28:56.635 --> 28:59.369
[Buck] Whatever that was
had some serious lung power.

28:59.371 --> 29:01.338
[Wild Bill] Well, that damn --
Big damn tree over in there.

29:01.340 --> 29:03.474
<i>[Willy] Go down the holler
and you'll see another holler...</i>

29:03.476 --> 29:04.274
<i>[Jeff] Get that
drone over there.</i>

29:04.276 --> 29:05.609
Yeah, get that drone over there.

29:05.611 --> 29:07.211
<i>[Buck] Right there,
right there, all right,</i>

29:07.213 --> 29:08.812
<i>go about halfway up that ridge.</i>

29:08.814 --> 29:10.214
Look at them top of that
tree, Willy. It's moving.

29:10.216 --> 29:11.215
[Buck] Hold up,
hold up, hold up.

29:11.217 --> 29:12.149
Look there.

29:12.151 --> 29:13.283
[Buck] Now start
going up this holler.

29:13.285 --> 29:14.985
[Wild Bill]
See top of this one is moving.

29:14.987 --> 29:16.353
[Buck] Let's go nice and easy,
nice and easy.

29:16.355 --> 29:17.287
[Jeff] Yeah, it's gone.

29:17.289 --> 29:18.789
[tree knock]

29:18.791 --> 29:20.657
- Son of a bitch!
- That was a tree knock.

29:20.659 --> 29:22.926
- Listen.
- That was a tree knock, sure as hell.

29:22.928 --> 29:26.130
We're standing there, and
there's no damn doubt about it,

29:26.132 --> 29:28.232
right there,
there's a tree knock.

29:28.234 --> 29:30.000
[Willy] That definitely
is a tree knock.

29:30.002 --> 29:31.068
[Buck] Hold up, hold up.

29:31.070 --> 29:32.603
We've got a Bigfoot

29:32.605 --> 29:34.738
and that bastard
is close as hell.

29:34.740 --> 29:38.041
Go about another 50 yards
and go up.

29:38.043 --> 29:41.044
-[tree knock] -Son of
a bitch. What was that?

29:41.046 --> 29:43.046
[Buck] Look, look,
look, look, look look.

29:43.048 --> 29:45.282
[indistinct shouting]

29:45.284 --> 29:46.517
[bleep]

29:49.788 --> 29:50.821
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

29:50.823 --> 29:53.123
That Bigfoot
just tore that tree down.

29:57.929 --> 30:00.164
[Buck] Go about
another 50 yards and go up.

30:00.166 --> 30:01.098
- [tree knock]
- Son of a bitch!

30:01.100 --> 30:02.866
[Wild Bill] What was that?

30:02.868 --> 30:04.234
[Buck] Look, look,
look, look, look look.

30:05.236 --> 30:07.237
[everyone clamoring]

30:12.310 --> 30:14.211
[Buck] That Bigfoot
just tore that tree down.

30:16.181 --> 30:17.681
<i>[Wild Bill] Holy hell!</i>

30:17.683 --> 30:20.984
<i>Cowboy Ken
zooms in on that drone</i>

30:20.986 --> 30:25.289
and there it is, the damn big ass
tree comes crashing to the ground.

30:25.291 --> 30:27.891
[Buck] You heard that high pitch
squeal and you heard that tree knock,

30:27.893 --> 30:29.927
you know exactly what took
that tree down. That's a Bigfoot.

30:29.929 --> 30:31.728
Hell yeah. That Bigfoot,
that son of a bitch

30:31.730 --> 30:33.764
just ripped that
big ass tree down.

30:33.766 --> 30:37.000
And Cowboy Ken, he got
it right there on his drone.

30:37.002 --> 30:39.169
Ken, get that drone back.
We need to get over there.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.438
Yeah, Kenneth, we need
to get over to where that tree

30:41.440 --> 30:43.574
just come down and
get over there now.

30:43.576 --> 30:45.943
Oh, yeah. Let's get
over there right now!

30:45.945 --> 30:48.078
[indistinct shouting]

30:48.080 --> 30:51.248
And I'm telling you,
we have a Bigfoot out here.

30:51.250 --> 30:53.217
[Wild bill] That son of a
bitch is right here, boys.

30:53.219 --> 30:55.285
[indistinct shouting]

30:55.287 --> 30:57.821
[Wild Bill] It sounded like
it was right here.

30:57.823 --> 30:59.423
Sounded like he was
in here. Let's go.

31:00.625 --> 31:02.392
- Get down there.
- [Willy] Damn, guys.

31:02.394 --> 31:04.862
[Wild Bill] It's busted,
you can hear [bleep].

31:04.864 --> 31:05.796
[Buck] Now, easy, easy, easy.

31:05.798 --> 31:06.830
[Jeff] Easy now.

31:06.832 --> 31:08.232
We've got a
Bigfoot in here, guys.

31:08.234 --> 31:10.434
[Buck] Hell yeah,
we've got to be cautious.

31:10.436 --> 31:11.802
[Willy] We need to ease up here.

31:11.804 --> 31:14.538
[Jeff] Guys, stay tight.
Keep your eyes open.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.306
[Wild Bill] If there's
a damn Bigfoot in here,

31:16.308 --> 31:18.442
we better watch our ass.

31:18.444 --> 31:19.977
We're getting
in some serious [bleep].

31:19.979 --> 31:21.812
[Willy] Yeah, right
down in there, guys.

31:21.814 --> 31:24.581
<i>[Wild Bill] These Bigfoot
are territorial as hell.</i>

31:24.583 --> 31:26.383
By God, they don't play around.

31:26.385 --> 31:28.218
[Willy] All right, stay
in here with us Ken.

31:28.220 --> 31:31.054
[Jeff] Damn, I wish
I had my weapon with me.

31:31.056 --> 31:31.922
[Willy] Hell, yeah.

31:31.924 --> 31:33.757
[Buck] Look here.
Look here. Look here.

31:33.759 --> 31:35.893
- [Willy] What do you got?
- [Wild Bill] What do you got, Buck?

31:35.895 --> 31:38.028
Damn, look at this, guys.
Get the hell up here.

31:39.230 --> 31:41.098
Daggone!

31:43.801 --> 31:45.135
[Wild Bill] Son of a bitch!

31:45.137 --> 31:46.236
- Dang!
- Look at this.

31:46.238 --> 31:49.039
Look at this. My gosh!

31:49.041 --> 31:51.041
[Buck] I spot that tree
right up ahead.

31:51.043 --> 31:52.576
I hurry up and get up there.

31:52.578 --> 31:54.845
Man, this thing has
tore all to shreds.

31:54.847 --> 31:55.646
Look at that.

31:55.648 --> 31:57.047
[Willy] Oh, damn.

31:57.049 --> 32:00.550
You can see where it's been
split in half and ripped to pieces.

32:00.552 --> 32:02.853
That's a damn tree
a Bigfoot ripped down.

32:02.855 --> 32:05.555
I think this squatch is going
to get nicknamed Paul Bunyan.

32:05.557 --> 32:07.958
- Look at the size of this tree.
- Yeah.

32:07.960 --> 32:11.361
[Wild Bill] It's a big oak, about
probably 50, 60 years old,

32:11.363 --> 32:12.930
70, somewhere around there.

32:12.932 --> 32:14.598
This is one
pissed off Bigfoot, guys.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.233
- Yes, it is.
- Oh, you bet it is.

32:16.235 --> 32:19.102
You think he got mad because
we had that drone in there?

32:19.104 --> 32:20.938
That's a good possibility.

32:20.940 --> 32:22.039
That's a good...

32:22.041 --> 32:24.207
he's pissed about something.

32:24.209 --> 32:25.943
Guys, I got
a big question for you.

32:25.945 --> 32:27.177
[Willy] What's that?

32:27.179 --> 32:29.046
[Huckleberry]
If Bigfoot did this,

32:29.048 --> 32:30.414
where's he at?

32:31.049 --> 32:33.417
[Buck] I guess
he's not real far.

32:38.189 --> 32:39.923
I'll tell you what I think
we need to do, guys.

32:39.925 --> 32:41.291
It's starting to get dark.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.627
We need to go back,
get our lights, get our guns,

32:43.629 --> 32:45.162
get the thermal
and get back out here.

32:45.164 --> 32:47.030
- [Willy] Yeah, let's go.
- Oh, yeah.

32:47.032 --> 32:49.766
We need to get the hell
out of here and weapon up.

32:49.768 --> 32:51.935
- All right, guys.
- [indistinct chatter]

32:51.937 --> 32:54.671
By God, we're coming right
back to this very same location.

32:54.673 --> 32:56.206
Come on, Cowboy Ken.

32:56.208 --> 33:00.043
We got a hot lead and we're closing
in on this tree crushing bastard.

33:00.045 --> 33:01.945
<i>It's time for us to bring it.</i>

33:01.947 --> 33:03.547
It's Bigfoot time.

33:03.549 --> 33:05.282
[Buck]
Welcome to the team, Ken.

33:10.955 --> 33:13.056
- [Wild Bill] Ken, right here?
- [Cowboy Ken] Yeah right here.

33:13.058 --> 33:14.257
<i>[Buck] This has to be
the quickest</i>

33:14.259 --> 33:16.626
we've ever got ready
for a night investigation.

33:16.628 --> 33:17.894
[Jeff] All right. Let's roll.

33:17.896 --> 33:19.596
<i>[Buck] Just a half hour ago,</i>

33:19.598 --> 33:22.299
we was in the money on a
Bigfoot knocking a tree down.

33:22.301 --> 33:24.601
And here we are,
hot on its trail.

33:24.603 --> 33:26.236
[Wild Bill] Okay back there,
Cowboy Ken?

33:26.238 --> 33:28.939
[Cowboy Ken]
I'm staying close to you, man.

33:28.941 --> 33:30.140
<i>[Buck] We're heading
right back to that tree...</i>

33:30.142 --> 33:31.608
Yeah, right here it is.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.944
<i>[Buck] ...that we know got
ripped down by a Bigfoot.</i>

33:33.946 --> 33:35.979
[Wild Bill]
Hell, look at that.

33:35.981 --> 33:38.215
We got to get back
on the hunt again.

33:38.217 --> 33:39.916
Come on over here.
Come on over here, Ken.

33:39.918 --> 33:41.218
Sure.

33:42.120 --> 33:43.219
Special guest.

33:43.221 --> 33:44.721
- [Willy] That's right.
- [Cowboy Ken] I appreciate it.

33:44.723 --> 33:46.089
Guys, take a look at this.

33:49.193 --> 33:53.096
This is just a small example of
what this Bigfoot is capable of.

33:53.364 --> 33:55.032
[Willy] Hell, yeah.

33:56.834 --> 33:58.502
Jeff had a great idea.

33:58.504 --> 34:01.104
He thinks that Cowboy Ken
flying that drone

34:01.106 --> 34:04.808
is what really poked the hornet's
nest with this Bigfoot and got him mad.

34:04.810 --> 34:06.076
[Huckleberry] Oh, yeah.

34:06.078 --> 34:08.078
Rattle his
old chain a little bit.

34:08.080 --> 34:09.279
Jeff's got a pretty good theory.

34:09.281 --> 34:11.615
You made him mad.
Look at this.

34:11.617 --> 34:14.251
He thinks that drone
being up in the air...

34:15.820 --> 34:17.921
<i>irritated that Bigfoot
to the point</i>

34:17.923 --> 34:20.090
where it ripped that tree up
out of the ground and chucked it.

34:24.862 --> 34:27.697
So tonight,
we have a special guest,

34:27.699 --> 34:31.168
Cowboy Ken and his drone
are going to come in handy.

34:31.170 --> 34:33.003
We need to get back
on this thing's trail.

34:33.005 --> 34:35.005
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

34:35.007 --> 34:38.775
Although Ken with that drone
got him good and fired up,

34:38.777 --> 34:43.113
my thought is we stick to the old
tried and true method to start off with.

34:43.115 --> 34:44.281
Let's try a tree knock.

34:44.283 --> 34:46.016
- Oh, yeah.
- Hell yeah.

34:46.018 --> 34:47.784
- Get out of here, Buck.
- All right.

34:47.786 --> 34:50.887
We do a tree knock, we get a
response, we know which way to go.

34:50.889 --> 34:54.024
If we don't, we'll get that
drone up in the air again

34:54.026 --> 34:56.259
and see if we can't get this
Bigfoot fired back up.

34:56.261 --> 34:57.928
- Insomuch.
- Yeah.

34:57.930 --> 35:00.831
Before Cowboy Ken
gets that drone airborne,

35:00.833 --> 35:05.936
we're going to stick to the old school
method, the tried and true tree knock.

35:05.938 --> 35:10.841
As you know, earlier today, we
asked Cowboy Ken for a pretty big favor.

35:10.843 --> 35:13.043
Oh yeah, a big one.

35:13.045 --> 35:16.346
Well, Cowboy Ken
has a favor to ask out of us.

35:16.348 --> 35:18.215
Oh, yeah?

35:18.616 --> 35:20.016
That didn't take long.

35:20.018 --> 35:22.052
[laughter]

35:25.256 --> 35:29.226
You know, before I started
flying the drone for the show,

35:29.228 --> 35:31.161
I was always a big fan.

35:31.163 --> 35:32.762
I mean, I love
watching you guys.

35:32.764 --> 35:35.065
All right, yeah.

35:35.067 --> 35:39.269
My personal dream
is I would love

35:39.271 --> 35:41.271
to do a tree knock
with you guys.

35:41.273 --> 35:43.340
[indistinct chatter]

35:43.342 --> 35:45.375
- Oh, yeah.
- All right, sweet.

35:45.377 --> 35:46.843
Well, Ken, pick you out a stick.

35:46.845 --> 35:48.378
All right, man.

35:48.380 --> 35:51.214
Before Cowboy Ken started flying
the drone for this television show,

35:51.216 --> 35:53.183
he was a huge fan.

35:53.185 --> 35:54.985
[Cowboy Ken] Hey, I think
I found a good one here.

35:54.987 --> 35:56.987
All right.

35:56.989 --> 35:59.356
Tonight, we're going to make
one fan's dream come true.

35:59.358 --> 36:01.057
- All right, Cowboy Ken...
- Yeah.

36:01.059 --> 36:03.426
Show these guys how to do it.

36:03.428 --> 36:05.762
Sort of a protege
of Buck's on this.

36:05.764 --> 36:08.765
[laughter]

36:08.767 --> 36:10.767
[Cowboy Ken] So the
first thing you've got to do,

36:10.769 --> 36:14.604
- you got to get a good grip on it.
- Oh, yeah.

36:14.606 --> 36:17.541
And then you have to rev up.

36:18.342 --> 36:21.044
[all laughing]

36:21.279 --> 36:23.146
Yes! Yes!

36:23.148 --> 36:25.448
Yes!

36:29.086 --> 36:32.956
Cowboy Ken shows up
and completely saves the day.

36:32.958 --> 36:34.991
You have been
watching this show.

36:34.993 --> 36:36.459
You see his hip shake?

36:38.095 --> 36:39.663
He might put Elvis to shame.

36:39.665 --> 36:41.198
I think I hurt something.

36:42.900 --> 36:45.835
I never dreamed my protege
would be older than me.

36:45.837 --> 36:48.004
- Here we go.
- All right.

36:50.541 --> 36:53.443
- Oh [bleep]!
- Damn, Kenneth.

36:53.445 --> 36:54.744
[Buck] Shh, listen.

36:54.746 --> 36:56.213
Wow.

36:57.848 --> 37:00.817
<i>[Wild Bill] Cowboy Ken, he
smacked the hell out of that tree,</i>

37:00.819 --> 37:03.119
I bust my damn eardrum.

37:03.888 --> 37:06.389
<i>And for the damn squatch
in this holler,</i>

37:06.391 --> 37:10.427
I'm telling you right now, he heard
that tree knock from Cowboy Ken.

37:11.796 --> 37:13.296
[Buck] Can you hear anything?

37:13.298 --> 37:16.233
[Willy] No, I ain't
hearing a thing.

37:16.235 --> 37:17.767
[Jeff] That's a good
tree knock though.

37:17.769 --> 37:19.603
- [Willy] Hell, yes.
- [Jeff] Damn good.

37:19.605 --> 37:21.004
Sorry, we didn't get anything.

37:21.006 --> 37:22.973
Hey, don't be down on yourself.

37:22.975 --> 37:24.741
- That was plan A.
- Yeah.

37:24.743 --> 37:27.410
Plan B is the drone.

37:27.412 --> 37:30.247
You're more involved in this
hunt than you realize, brother.

37:31.315 --> 37:32.716
I'm starting to realize that.

37:32.783 --> 37:34.718
Yeah, you want to grab that drone
to see if we can't get it airborne

37:34.720 --> 37:36.119
and see if
we can't get some action.

37:36.121 --> 37:37.053
- [Cowboy Ken] Will do.
- All right.

37:37.055 --> 37:38.221
[tree knock]

37:38.223 --> 37:40.323
[Wild Bill] Holy [bleep]!
Right up in there.

37:40.325 --> 37:41.791
That's a damn tree knock.

37:41.793 --> 37:43.260
[Buck] Hell, yes, it was.

37:46.197 --> 37:48.298
[Buck] You want to grab that drone
and see if we can't get it airborne

37:48.300 --> 37:49.899
and see
if we can get some action?

37:49.901 --> 37:50.834
- [Cowboy Ken] Will do.
- All right.

37:50.836 --> 37:51.935
[tree knock]

37:51.937 --> 37:53.270
[Wild Bill] Holy [bleep]!
Right up in there.

37:53.272 --> 37:54.137
That's a damn tree knock.

37:54.139 --> 37:55.438
[Willy] Hell, yes, it was.

37:56.607 --> 37:59.175
Guys, the hunt is on.

37:59.177 --> 38:01.144
Kill those lights and go to IR.

38:01.146 --> 38:03.013
[Wild Bill] Damn.

38:03.015 --> 38:05.282
All right, that sounded like
it was just right up the hill.

38:05.284 --> 38:06.783
- [Jeff] Hell yeah.
- It's not far.

38:06.785 --> 38:09.886
I know Ken didn't expect to
be out here doing tree knocks

38:09.888 --> 38:11.187
and actually get a response.

38:11.189 --> 38:12.422
[tree knock]

38:12.424 --> 38:13.790
[Wild Bill] Holy [bleep]!

38:13.792 --> 38:15.058
Right up in there.

38:15.060 --> 38:16.960
- That was a damn tree knock.
- [Jeff] Hell, yes. It was.

38:17.328 --> 38:18.895
<i>[Buck] Welcome, Cowboy Ken.</i>

38:18.897 --> 38:20.297
You're an AIMS member.

38:20.299 --> 38:21.331
All right, here's the plan.

38:21.333 --> 38:22.499
Willy, Bill,

38:23.534 --> 38:26.036
Cowboy Ken, all right,

38:26.038 --> 38:29.973
you three start up the holler about a 150
yards and work on the side of that hill.

38:29.975 --> 38:31.941
Jeffro, Huck, we're going to
go this way.

38:31.943 --> 38:34.911
We're all spread out and see if
we can't get our eyes on this side.

38:34.913 --> 38:37.147
Two teams,
double chance of seeing one.

38:38.249 --> 38:39.849
Are you good
with that, Cowboy Ken?

38:39.851 --> 38:41.051
[bleep] yeah.

38:41.053 --> 38:42.152
[laughter]

38:42.154 --> 38:43.286
Yes! Yes!

38:43.288 --> 38:45.221
All right, guys, let's
get on the hunt. Let's go.

38:45.223 --> 38:46.856
Cowboy Ken came through.

38:46.858 --> 38:47.857
Good luck, guys.

38:47.859 --> 38:49.059
Right up over
that hill right there, Bill.

38:49.061 --> 38:50.293
<i>[Buck] We're going to split up,</i>

38:50.295 --> 38:52.195
work up towards where
we heard that tree knock,

38:52.197 --> 38:53.863
see if we can't lay eyes on it.

38:53.865 --> 38:55.031
[Willy] Come
right through, guys.

38:55.033 --> 38:57.834
[Wild Bill] Yeah, just keep
heading up that way, Bill.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.369
[Willy] Ken, you can
stay right between us.

38:59.371 --> 39:00.603
[Cowboy Ken] I will.

39:01.339 --> 39:04.207
Nice and easy, boys.

39:06.110 --> 39:09.145
[Buck]
Hey, guys, check this out.

39:09.814 --> 39:11.014
Look at this.

39:11.016 --> 39:13.583
[Jeff] Wow, my gosh,
look at this thing.

39:14.919 --> 39:18.221
Man, that's creepy looking.

39:18.223 --> 39:19.589
<i>[Huckleberry] We're
walking along this trail.</i>

39:19.591 --> 39:21.124
All of a sudden we look up

39:21.126 --> 39:25.261
and here's this big old honey locust
all gnarled together, twisted together.

39:25.263 --> 39:28.665
[Buck] That whole honey locust
is twisted in every direction.

39:28.667 --> 39:29.766
[Jeff] Yeah, it is.

39:29.768 --> 39:31.234
[Huckleberry]
<i>Looking up at this tree,</i>

39:31.236 --> 39:32.769
this don't give me
any good feeling.

39:32.771 --> 39:35.405
It sure looks like
it should be Bigfoot country.

39:36.907 --> 39:41.878
This thing, it pierces you
right to the center of your soul.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.547
[Jeff] I'm telling you, guys,
that's the devil tree.

39:45.750 --> 39:48.752
[Buck] And it's
creepy looking. Ain't it?

39:48.754 --> 39:52.088
Hey, hey, step back, look here.

39:52.090 --> 39:55.191
Hey, guys,
here's a side-by-side trail.

39:55.193 --> 39:57.827
- Hell yes.
- [Jeff] Oh, yes.

39:57.829 --> 40:02.065
That nest in that video was
right along the side-by-side trail.

40:02.967 --> 40:05.101
- [Huckleberry] Yeah.
- [Jeff] Yeah.

40:05.103 --> 40:06.669
Guys, we're in the money.

40:06.671 --> 40:09.339
In that video
that Jeffro has of that nest,

40:09.341 --> 40:12.876
<i>you can clearly see a
side-by-side trail right nearby.</i>

40:12.878 --> 40:15.845
That nest,
it may not be too far away.

40:15.847 --> 40:17.147
Let's start beating this trail.

40:17.149 --> 40:19.416
- You ready?
- Yeah, yeah.

40:20.251 --> 40:23.153
Let's keep moving
the bush away, boys.

40:23.155 --> 40:25.355
[Buck] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, listen, listen, listen.

40:25.357 --> 40:26.823
You hear that?

40:26.825 --> 40:28.258
[Huckleberry] Yeah.

40:29.860 --> 40:32.929
[Buck] It sounds like something's
moaning or crying or something.

40:34.632 --> 40:36.266
- You hear that, Cowboy?
- [Cowboy Ken] Yeah.

40:36.268 --> 40:39.202
[Buck] It's coming from back
here, boys, right over there.

40:39.204 --> 40:41.204
[Buck speaking]

40:41.206 --> 40:42.572
[Will] Go easy, Bill.

40:42.574 --> 40:44.274
This way right here.

40:44.276 --> 40:47.377
Guys, there's really not that
many side-by-side trails

40:47.379 --> 40:49.179
that we found
in the Tygart Valley.

40:49.181 --> 40:50.280
No.

40:50.915 --> 40:52.949
[Buck] Keep that thermal
imaging.

40:52.951 --> 40:54.284
All right. I got it, buddy.

40:54.286 --> 40:56.719
[indistinct chatter]

40:56.721 --> 40:58.955
Hey, look here,
look here, look here.

40:59.356 --> 41:01.591
- Wow.
- What we got? What we got?

41:03.394 --> 41:05.028
[Buck] Pine leaves.

41:08.232 --> 41:09.933
That's fresh.

41:09.935 --> 41:12.035
We've got to be
getting close to that nest.

41:12.037 --> 41:13.970
The whole outside of the nest
was covered in pine leaves.

41:13.972 --> 41:15.672
- Yeah, it was.
- Yeah.

41:15.674 --> 41:18.074
<i>[Jeff] Yeah, the whole nest
was made out of pine leaves.</i>

41:18.076 --> 41:22.145
-There's nothing around. Do you see any pine trees?
-I ain't seen one right here.

41:22.147 --> 41:24.013
- This is all hardwood, boys.
- [Jeff] Yeah.

41:24.015 --> 41:25.014
Big stuff.

41:25.016 --> 41:27.183
There is a dead honey locust.

41:27.185 --> 41:29.352
- Scary [bleep].
- Guys, look at this.

41:31.355 --> 41:34.324
Daggone!

41:34.892 --> 41:36.392
Oh, my God.

41:41.098 --> 41:42.332
There it is.

41:46.871 --> 41:48.538
Never seen anything like this.

41:53.577 --> 41:57.981
That is a massive Bigfoot nest.
