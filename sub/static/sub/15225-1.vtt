01:20.567 --> 01:23.133
Saturday night is just fine.

01:23.167 --> 01:24.267
Okay. Thank you.

01:24.300 --> 01:25.534
Bye-bye.

01:25.567 --> 01:26.734
( <i>screams</i> )
Guys!

01:26.767 --> 01:28.501
Doug Johnson
from the art gallery

01:28.534 --> 01:31.167
just asked me out
for this Saturday night!

01:31.200 --> 01:32.667
Oh, that's very nice.

01:32.701 --> 01:34.000
That's wonderful.
That's terrific.

01:34.033 --> 01:36.100
Yes, and I don't have
a baby-sitter, so could...?

01:37.734 --> 01:39.701
Uh, uh, uh, Bobby,
do you think...?

01:39.734 --> 01:41.701
Uh, Elaine, I-I already
have plans. I'm sorry.

01:41.734 --> 01:43.200
Oh, well, um,

01:43.234 --> 01:44.334
Tony...

01:44.367 --> 01:45.534
I'd like to, Elaine,

01:45.567 --> 01:47.467
but I got a fight
Saturday night.

01:47.501 --> 01:49.067
Bobby, just this once?
Come on.

01:49.100 --> 01:52.100
Look, I have a date
Saturday night, Elaine,
with a great girl.

01:52.133 --> 01:53.801
Oh, but I-I've been
dropping hints

01:53.834 --> 01:55.767
for months now
for Doug to ask me out.

01:55.801 --> 01:58.067
Hey, you know, this may be
hard for you to believe,

01:58.100 --> 01:59.634
but other people
have relationships

01:59.667 --> 02:01.467
that are important
to them, too.
( <i>sighs</i> )

02:01.501 --> 02:03.767
And-and this girl I'm going
out with Saturday night

02:03.801 --> 02:06.033
is every bit as important
to me as Doug is to you.

02:06.067 --> 02:07.634
What's her name?

02:08.868 --> 02:10.400
What time do you want me there?

02:11.834 --> 02:13.334
8:00.

02:15.467 --> 02:17.234
Rieger, come in here.

02:20.734 --> 02:22.300
Rieger!
( <i>snapping fingers</i> )

02:22.334 --> 02:23.601
Come in here!

02:25.601 --> 02:26.868
Rieger!

02:28.300 --> 02:29.501
( <i>whispers</i> ):
Come in here!

02:33.400 --> 02:34.534
Wait a minute!

02:34.567 --> 02:36.033
Stay right
where you are!

02:36.067 --> 02:37.434
I'll come down there!

02:42.434 --> 02:44.000
Alex?

02:44.033 --> 02:46.868
I got problems
with my love life.

02:46.901 --> 02:48.467
Get away from me.

02:50.834 --> 02:53.734
Things aren't right
between Zena and me.

02:53.767 --> 02:55.901
That's right,
the girl you like.

02:55.934 --> 02:57.534
So now you got
to listen to me.

02:57.567 --> 02:59.667
I could have got you
to come in the cage

02:59.701 --> 03:01.434
if I'd have
said her name, yeah.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.033
I don't understand it.

03:05.067 --> 03:08.200
I mean, it's like somehow
we got out of sync.

03:08.234 --> 03:11.367
Our gears aren't meshing
as often as they used to,

03:11.400 --> 03:13.133
if you know what I mean.

03:14.167 --> 03:15.133
( <i>mutters</i> )

03:15.167 --> 03:16.501
Rieger, I'm pouring

03:16.534 --> 03:19.534
my guts out to you.
You're not pouring
your guts out to me.

03:19.567 --> 03:22.434
You're telling me that you're
not getting enough action.

03:22.467 --> 03:24.767
Insatiable lust doesn't
make you sympathetic.

03:24.801 --> 03:26.467
Why not?

03:28.100 --> 03:30.801
All right, all right. I'll
tell you the real reason.

03:31.801 --> 03:32.868
The real thing...

03:32.901 --> 03:34.300
Yeah? What?

03:34.334 --> 03:35.601
( <i>mutters</i> )
Go ahead. What?

03:35.634 --> 03:36.601
What? Say it.

03:36.634 --> 03:37.634
I...
Say it. Say it.

03:37.667 --> 03:39.200
Say it! Say it!I...
Say it! Say it!

03:39.234 --> 03:41.300
I'm afraid of losing her.

03:41.334 --> 03:43.334
Ohh.

03:43.367 --> 03:45.267
Alex...

03:45.300 --> 03:47.367
Zena sees
something in me

03:47.400 --> 03:49.467
that no other woman
ever saw--

03:49.501 --> 03:52.367
that no other <i>person</i>
ever saw--

03:52.400 --> 03:53.868
that isn't there.

03:57.300 --> 03:59.434
All right, all right,
do you want to keep Zena?

03:59.467 --> 04:01.334
You're going to have
to treat her better.

04:01.367 --> 04:03.567
What makes you think I
don't treat her good now?

04:03.601 --> 04:06.234
Well, describe a typical
evening with Zena.

04:06.267 --> 04:09.667
We watch a little TV
and then hit the sheets.

04:09.701 --> 04:11.434
Well, some people
call that corny,

04:11.467 --> 04:12.801
but that's the way we are.

04:12.834 --> 04:14.033
( <i>mutters</i> )

04:14.067 --> 04:15.634
All right, all right.

04:15.667 --> 04:17.934
Describe a typical
good evening

04:17.968 --> 04:20.567
to you experienced,
romantic types.

04:20.601 --> 04:22.934
All right, you go out to dinner

04:22.968 --> 04:24.434
maybe you take in
a movie,

04:24.467 --> 04:25.968
you go home,
and you talk.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.968
Dinner, talk...

04:31.167 --> 04:32.868
Yeah? Well, well, well?

04:32.901 --> 04:36.033
You don't want to know
what you talk about?

04:36.067 --> 04:38.100
Yeah. I mean,
give me an example.

04:38.133 --> 04:40.734
Sports,
people you have in common.

04:40.767 --> 04:41.901
You talk.

04:41.934 --> 04:42.901
Sports...

04:42.934 --> 04:44.767
people in common...

04:44.801 --> 04:47.734
You mean, like, uh,
if the house looks clean

04:47.767 --> 04:51.200
I could say,
"Hey, the place looks great."

04:52.200 --> 04:54.434
Sure.

04:54.467 --> 04:57.601
That was my idea.

04:57.634 --> 04:58.834
I thought of the words.

04:58.868 --> 05:00.067
You just said, "talk."

05:00.100 --> 05:01.434
( <i>chuckling</i> )

05:01.467 --> 05:03.100
I got the golden key here.

05:03.133 --> 05:04.567
Look out, world.

05:04.601 --> 05:07.100
Dinner, movies...

05:07.133 --> 05:08.133
sports...

05:08.167 --> 05:11.367
Gee, the place
looks immaculate.

05:19.334 --> 05:20.467
You're going
to get it.

05:20.501 --> 05:22.501
What are you talking about?

05:22.534 --> 05:24.167
I'm talking about
your attitude.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.067
Trying to romance you
is like trying

05:26.100 --> 05:29.200
to blow your nose
without a handkerchief.

05:29.234 --> 05:30.367
That's disgusting.

05:30.400 --> 05:32.734
I can't do
nothing right tonight.

05:32.767 --> 05:35.334
87 bucks
for a French meal

05:35.367 --> 05:38.901
you don't want to eat,
they don't want me
to take home.

05:38.934 --> 05:42.534
I got to go out and find
my own bags at 8:00 at night.

05:44.434 --> 05:46.834
I don't know
what the hell <i>this</i> is.

05:46.868 --> 05:49.167
You order something with eyes?

05:49.200 --> 05:50.834
No.

05:50.868 --> 05:52.334
Me, neither.

05:52.367 --> 05:55.701
Look, Louie, I'd like to
get to sleep early tonight,

05:55.734 --> 05:57.033
so if you don't mind...

05:57.067 --> 05:59.000
No, no, no.
I don't mind.

05:59.033 --> 06:01.367
Louie. Louie!

06:01.400 --> 06:03.434
What, what? I'll
brush my teeth
in the morning.

06:03.467 --> 06:04.868
I want you to leave here.

06:04.901 --> 06:06.734
I want you
to leave my apartment.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.434
I want you
to leave me alone.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.467
Boy, this place

06:14.501 --> 06:16.000
looks immaculate.

06:17.434 --> 06:19.334
Louie, I don't want
to be ignored.

06:19.367 --> 06:21.901
I need to be alone.
I'm very tense tonight.

06:25.667 --> 06:28.267
I know what'll take
the tension out of you.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.367
Oh, no. No.

06:29.400 --> 06:31.334
( <i>high-pitched whooping</i> )

06:32.367 --> 06:33.467
( <i>shouts</i> )

06:35.234 --> 06:36.801
( <i>grunts</i> )

06:36.834 --> 06:39.067
( <i>choking</i> ):
Zena, you seem

06:39.100 --> 06:41.767
a little distant tonight.

06:45.634 --> 06:48.501
What did I do so bad?

06:48.534 --> 06:49.834
Send me to jail.

06:49.868 --> 06:52.167
I think you're beautiful.

06:52.200 --> 06:53.367
You arouse me.

06:53.400 --> 06:56.267
Officer, take me away.

06:56.300 --> 06:59.234
I want you to leave.

07:01.067 --> 07:02.767
All right.

07:02.801 --> 07:04.367
Okay, I'm leaving.

07:06.100 --> 07:07.701
Listen...

07:07.734 --> 07:11.234
how about one little glass
of apricot brandy,

07:11.267 --> 07:13.300
just for the trail home?

07:13.334 --> 07:15.801
I don't have any apricot brandy.

07:15.834 --> 07:17.801
Louie does.

07:17.834 --> 07:20.567
Louie, don't you
even want to know

07:20.601 --> 07:22.200
what's bothering me?

07:22.234 --> 07:24.534
Well, whatever it is,
it couldn't be that bad.

07:24.567 --> 07:26.801
I mean, you still
love me, don't you?

07:32.067 --> 07:33.868
Please let me be deaf.

07:33.901 --> 07:35.300
( <i>glass pings</i> )

07:35.334 --> 07:36.400
( <i>low groan</i> )

07:37.634 --> 07:38.834
Louie...

07:38.868 --> 07:39.934
I'm sorry.

07:39.968 --> 07:42.267
I'm really sorry.

07:43.267 --> 07:45.501
But I met another man.

07:56.968 --> 08:00.267
Louie, I didn't want
to bring it up, because...

08:00.300 --> 08:04.300
see, I was just hoping
it would kind of
sort itself out.

08:11.667 --> 08:13.400
I'm a little bit confused.

08:13.434 --> 08:15.234
You see...

08:15.267 --> 08:17.067
two weeks ago

08:17.100 --> 08:20.400
a girlfriend and I
went to Mario's

08:20.434 --> 08:23.834
for a drink after work,
and I met this guy, Dwight.

08:23.868 --> 08:26.501
He's the day
bartender there.

08:26.534 --> 08:27.934
At Mario's?

08:27.968 --> 08:29.267
Mario's.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.767
He asked me to go out with him.

08:31.801 --> 08:34.033
And normally
I would have said no,

08:34.067 --> 08:35.734
and I did think of you,

08:35.767 --> 08:37.267
but he was so nice,

08:37.299 --> 08:40.933
and right away there was
something good between us.

08:40.967 --> 08:42.501
I'm sure you don't want
to know the details.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.167
No, you don't, really.

08:49.868 --> 08:51.601
We had lunch together.

08:51.634 --> 08:53.267
We had several lunches.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.567
Then one evening
we had dinner.

08:55.601 --> 08:57.367
Then we had more dinners.

08:57.400 --> 09:01.067
I don't know what happened,
but I kept on seeing him,

09:01.100 --> 09:03.067
but we weren't physical.

09:03.100 --> 09:05.100
( <i>sighs</i> )

09:06.934 --> 09:10.000
We were just friends,
and it was really great.

09:10.033 --> 09:13.133
And then, one day,
without my seeing
it coming

09:13.167 --> 09:14.801
or anybody
planning it,

09:14.834 --> 09:16.834
we became lovers.

09:21.834 --> 09:23.567
It came out
of our friendship--

09:23.601 --> 09:24.701
out of the fact

09:24.734 --> 09:26.968
that we enjoyed
each other's company.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.667
I don't know, maybe
if I'd seen it coming

09:28.701 --> 09:31.000
I could have done
something to stop it,

09:31.033 --> 09:32.834
but I didn't see
it coming.

09:35.767 --> 09:37.667
What's wrong?

09:40.667 --> 09:42.968
"I can't...

09:43.000 --> 09:44.467
breathe!"

09:44.501 --> 09:46.234
Oh, my God!

09:46.267 --> 09:48.501
Oh! Oh! Oh!

09:48.534 --> 09:50.000
What?

09:50.033 --> 09:51.501
Oh, drink!

09:51.534 --> 09:52.868
Okay. Here.

10:04.601 --> 10:06.667
So what are you saying, Zena?

10:08.000 --> 10:11.033
I mean, I'm missing something.

10:11.067 --> 10:13.100
What are you saying?

10:13.133 --> 10:15.133
I think it would be best

10:15.167 --> 10:17.200
if we didn't see
each other for a while

10:19.801 --> 10:21.234
Uh, okay.

10:25.234 --> 10:29.567
I see you got your mind
made up about this.

10:29.601 --> 10:32.200
If that's the way you want it,

10:32.234 --> 10:34.501
that's the way it will be.

10:34.534 --> 10:38.968
Let me just...
I'll get dressed

10:39.000 --> 10:41.934
and I'll leave you alone.

11:01.033 --> 11:02.467
One for the road.

11:12.667 --> 11:16.000
You know something, Zena?

11:16.033 --> 11:17.534
Someday...

11:17.567 --> 11:19.801
you're going
to come back to me--

11:19.834 --> 11:25.400
crawling on your knees,
begging me to take you back--

11:28.334 --> 11:30.000
and when you do...

11:32.033 --> 11:35.534
you know what I'll say?

11:35.567 --> 11:37.067
I'll say...

11:37.100 --> 11:39.367
thank God.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.634
( <i>low talking</i> )

11:58.200 --> 12:00.467
Have a beer, please?

12:00.501 --> 12:02.167
Hey, now, look, Elaine,
you tripped me up

12:02.200 --> 12:04.467
on this date thing
Saturday night.

12:04.501 --> 12:06.634
Now, I know I agreed
to baby-sit your kids,

12:06.667 --> 12:08.167
but I've reconsidered.

12:08.200 --> 12:11.667
I've always been bad with names,
and it's really important to me,

12:11.701 --> 12:13.133
and her name is Gloria.

12:13.167 --> 12:14.701
Gloria who?

12:15.734 --> 12:17.767
You said 8:00, right?

12:19.634 --> 12:20.968
Elaine?

12:21.000 --> 12:25.100
Would you care to dance?

12:25.133 --> 12:29.467
Jim, um,
there's not any music.

12:29.501 --> 12:32.234
There will be soon.
I put a quarter in the jukebox.

12:32.267 --> 12:35.434
No. You just put a quarter
in the cigarette machine.

12:36.834 --> 12:39.567
Well, Elaine,
would you care to smoke?

12:41.334 --> 12:44.067
I hate to do this, but
I got to get out of here.

12:44.100 --> 12:45.067
Got to get up
early in the morning.

12:45.100 --> 12:46.000
What for?

12:46.033 --> 12:47.467
I'm meeting you guys here
for breakfast.

12:47.501 --> 12:48.567
Mm.
Ah.
Right.

12:48.601 --> 12:49.968
We all better
get going.
Thanks, yeah.

12:50.000 --> 12:50.968
Hey, wait a minute.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.567
They haven't played
my cigarette yet.

12:52.601 --> 12:55.267
ALEX:
Jim, let's go.
Let's go, Jim.

12:55.300 --> 12:56.300
Hey, Louie.

12:56.334 --> 12:58.133
ELAINE:
You look awful.

12:58.167 --> 13:00.400
BOBBY:
What is that smell?

13:00.434 --> 13:03.000
Apricots?

13:03.033 --> 13:04.968
I'm shattered.

13:05.033 --> 13:08.300
It's terrible.

13:08.334 --> 13:10.067
My life is over.

13:10.100 --> 13:11.567
Oh. Well, I'll
see you tomorrow.

13:11.601 --> 13:12.601
See you, Louie.

13:20.801 --> 13:25.200
( <i>muted growling</i> )

13:25.234 --> 13:27.267
Hey, Lou?

13:27.300 --> 13:29.667
Come on. Sit down.

13:29.701 --> 13:31.300
All right.

13:32.968 --> 13:34.400
Hey, Lou...

13:34.434 --> 13:36.267
what's wrong?

13:36.300 --> 13:38.334
Zena left me.

13:39.834 --> 13:40.968
Oh, no.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.467
I was up all night,
drinking.

13:44.501 --> 13:46.467
The worst part
about it is

13:46.501 --> 13:48.567
I kept Ma up
all night too.

13:48.601 --> 13:50.234
Why was that?

13:50.267 --> 13:52.334
What do you
want me to do?

13:52.367 --> 13:54.634
Talk to the walls?

13:54.667 --> 13:58.100
Rieger, did you ever have
your guts ripped out

13:58.133 --> 13:59.300
by some woman?

13:59.334 --> 14:01.667
Louie, I know
exactly how you feel.

14:01.701 --> 14:05.534
I mean, just four years ago
I was going with this girl...

14:05.567 --> 14:07.434
What am I supposed
to do, here?

14:07.467 --> 14:08.968
My life is falling apart

14:09.000 --> 14:11.501
so I should listen
to stories about you?

14:11.534 --> 14:13.167
I mean, you know,
let's put

14:13.200 --> 14:15.167
the little selfishness
in check here.

14:15.200 --> 14:16.834
Sorry. Sorry.

14:16.868 --> 14:19.834
I ain't even told you
the worst part.

14:19.868 --> 14:22.467
Zena told me that she...

14:24.968 --> 14:28.434
she said she fell for a...
a bartender

14:28.467 --> 14:32.167
who works here at Mario's,
named Dwight.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.901
And I think

14:34.934 --> 14:36.601
that's him over there.

14:36.634 --> 14:38.400
Maybe not.

14:38.434 --> 14:39.567
Maybe not.

14:39.601 --> 14:42.000
He doesn't look
like a Dwight.

14:42.033 --> 14:45.901
Well, I know there's
one way to find out.

14:45.934 --> 14:47.334
Look out, Dwight!

14:53.868 --> 14:55.667
I think it's him.

14:55.701 --> 14:56.934
What was that
all about?

14:56.968 --> 14:58.534
Forget it. Forget it.
It's a false alarm.

14:58.567 --> 14:59.634
I'm going to go talk to him.

14:59.667 --> 15:00.667
No, no, no, no!

15:00.701 --> 15:02.067
Rieger, Rieger, Rieger,
I'm only

15:02.100 --> 15:03.701
going to go buy us
a couple of beers.

15:03.734 --> 15:04.767
No, no, no, no!

15:04.801 --> 15:05.767
I'll buy the beers.

15:05.801 --> 15:06.968
You sit. You sit.

15:07.000 --> 15:07.968
All right.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.367
Uh, fine, but while
you're over there

15:10.400 --> 15:12.567
pump the scum
for information.
No pumping.

15:12.601 --> 15:13.701
Pump him!
No pumping.

15:13.734 --> 15:15.033
Pump the scum!
Just beer!

15:15.067 --> 15:16.601
Pump the scum!
No! Just beer!

15:16.634 --> 15:18.100
Pump him! Pump the scum...

15:18.133 --> 15:20.400
No, Louie, I'm not
going to be a spy
for you. Now, sit.

15:20.434 --> 15:21.400
Sit!
Pump the scum.

15:21.434 --> 15:22.801
I said sit.

15:24.701 --> 15:25.667
Pump the scum!

15:25.701 --> 15:26.801
Sit!

15:26.834 --> 15:28.067
Pump him.

15:28.100 --> 15:29.334
Stay...

15:29.367 --> 15:30.434
Stay.

15:30.467 --> 15:32.400
Pump the scum.
Pump...
Stay. Stay.

15:33.667 --> 15:36.100
Stay. Sit, sit, sit!

Pump him!

Stay. Stay. Stay.

Stay. Stay...

15:42.501 --> 15:43.567
( <i>whispers</i> ):
Pump him.

15:43.601 --> 15:45.033
Two beers, please.

15:45.067 --> 15:46.367
What?

15:46.400 --> 15:47.667
Uh, two beers, please.

15:47.701 --> 15:50.367
Yeah. So how
are you doing?

15:50.400 --> 15:51.534
Huh? Fine. How are you?

15:51.567 --> 15:53.000
Well...

15:53.033 --> 15:54.234
I'm great now.
But I'll tell ya,

15:54.267 --> 15:56.534
if you'd asked me yesterday,
I would have been in trouble.

15:56.567 --> 15:58.634
But, uh, I think I finally
got it figured out.

15:58.667 --> 16:01.734
I met this new girl
in here a few weeks ago

16:01.767 --> 16:03.100
named Zena Sherman.

16:03.133 --> 16:05.701
She came in one day.
I was working
the day shift.

16:05.734 --> 16:08.334
Uh, we hit it off
real well right
away, you know?

16:08.367 --> 16:11.100
Next thing I know, we're seeing
each other almost every day.

16:11.133 --> 16:13.400
Things are getting
better and better all the time.

16:13.434 --> 16:17.334
All of a sudden,
she starts getting
serious on me.

16:17.367 --> 16:19.133
I mean, I don't have
to tell you that, uh,

16:19.167 --> 16:21.000
that takes all the fun
out of it, you know?

16:21.033 --> 16:22.801
So, I mean, I decided, hey,

16:22.834 --> 16:25.734
I'm just going
to stop seeing her, you know?

16:27.734 --> 16:29.300
Oh, uh, thank you.

16:29.334 --> 16:31.167
Thank you.

16:33.901 --> 16:35.367
What did he say?

16:35.400 --> 16:36.334
Uh...
Did you find out

16:36.367 --> 16:37.334
anything?
No, nothing much.

16:37.367 --> 16:38.400
He didn't get around

16:38.434 --> 16:40.200
to telling me
his dog tag numbers.

16:40.234 --> 16:41.534
Tell me. Tell me.

16:41.567 --> 16:44.133
Uh, all right. Uh, it is Dwight.

16:44.167 --> 16:45.367
( <i>growls</i> )
No, no, no!Scum!

16:45.400 --> 16:47.167
They been going with
each other for a
couple of weeks.

16:47.200 --> 16:50.734
She's serious. He's not.

16:50.767 --> 16:53.501
He's going to
break it off with her.

16:54.968 --> 16:56.234
I don't believe it.
Yeah.

16:56.267 --> 16:58.167
He's going to dump her?
Right.

16:59.234 --> 17:02.200
He's going to break
Zena's heart.

17:02.234 --> 17:04.300
That's good for me.

17:04.334 --> 17:06.634
But it's terrible for her.

17:06.666 --> 17:10.934
I can't help but have
mixed feelings about this.

17:10.968 --> 17:13.867
I'm torn between joy...

17:13.901 --> 17:15.300
and rapture.

17:24.200 --> 17:25.367
I'm sorry, Zena.

17:25.400 --> 17:27.601
I just thought I'd tell you
how I feel.

17:28.968 --> 17:30.501
( <i>door opening</i> )

17:30.534 --> 17:32.400
Hi.

17:32.434 --> 17:34.367
Sorry it couldn't
work out.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.567
Okay, okay.
Nobody's blaming you.

17:40.634 --> 17:41.601
Hi, Zena.

17:41.634 --> 17:42.968
Louie.

17:45.501 --> 17:47.934
Okay, okay. So you got hurt.

17:47.968 --> 17:50.267
We all get hurt.

17:52.033 --> 17:54.567
Everybody gets theirs.

17:54.601 --> 17:56.167
I got mine.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.601
You got yours.

17:58.634 --> 18:02.267
Everybody gets
everybody else's here.

18:02.300 --> 18:04.367
Everybody destroys,

18:04.400 --> 18:08.400
and everybody destroys
everybody else.

18:08.434 --> 18:09.934
It's what separates us

18:09.968 --> 18:11.200
from the animals.

18:17.033 --> 18:19.868
I think we can resume
on our old footing.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.567
I was going
to make you beg,

18:24.601 --> 18:26.100
but I can't now.

18:28.601 --> 18:30.267
Maybe a teeny bit.

18:31.567 --> 18:33.834
Louie, I don't want you back.

18:33.868 --> 18:36.300
You're going to have to do
a little better than that.

18:38.701 --> 18:40.534
I'm serious.

18:40.567 --> 18:42.534
What are you
talking about?

18:42.567 --> 18:44.033
No, Louie,
I really don't.

18:44.067 --> 18:45.133
We're through.

18:45.167 --> 18:46.434
Look...

18:46.467 --> 18:49.701
I didn't stop seeing you
only 'cause of Dwight.

18:49.734 --> 18:51.634
Most of the reasons
I stopped seeing ya

18:51.667 --> 18:52.934
have only to do with you.

18:52.968 --> 18:54.934
I suppose that's <i>my</i> fault.

18:59.634 --> 19:01.767
you have an attitude problem.

You've got a
personality problem.

19:04.200 --> 19:06.467
You got a sensitivity problem.

19:06.501 --> 19:08.200
You got a

You got an

You got a

19:11.534 --> 19:13.801
You got a
sexual problem.

19:17.167 --> 19:19.634
What do you mean?

19:19.667 --> 19:22.701
It's all you
ever think about.

19:22.734 --> 19:24.934
You mean, that's the problem?

19:24.968 --> 19:26.467
Yeah.

There is no way

19:43.400 --> 19:46.000
I am going
back with you.

19:54.834 --> 19:57.434
Zena, don't you love me?

19:57.467 --> 20:00.534
I don't know
what love is.

20:00.567 --> 20:03.534
Well, you're in luck,
'cause I do.

20:03.567 --> 20:06.167
And you know
something, Zena?

20:06.200 --> 20:08.834
You couldn't hear this
from anybody else,

20:08.868 --> 20:12.300
because I think that
I'm the only person alive

20:12.334 --> 20:14.100
who knows what love is.

20:14.133 --> 20:16.934
Because I read what
everybody else says it is,

20:16.968 --> 20:19.067
and I never see
the right answer.

20:20.100 --> 20:21.200
Okay.

20:21.234 --> 20:22.300
All right.

20:22.334 --> 20:23.934
You don't want
to know what love is?

20:23.968 --> 20:25.767
All right. You won't
know what love is.

20:25.801 --> 20:26.901
I'll know what love is.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.801
This is your last chance
to know what love is.

20:41.934 --> 20:44.067
Okay.
What is it?

20:44.100 --> 20:47.934
Love... is the end of happiness.

20:47.968 --> 20:51.100

20:52.567 --> 20:55.033
all a guy's got to do
to be happy

20:55.067 --> 20:57.200
is to watch the Mets.

20:57.234 --> 21:00.133
The next day,
you got to have Zena

21:00.167 --> 21:05.200
in the room
watching the Mets with you.

21:05.234 --> 21:07.300
You don't know why.

21:07.334 --> 21:09.734
They're still the Mets,

21:09.767 --> 21:11.767
it's the same room,

21:11.801 --> 21:15.534
but you got
to have Zena there.

21:15.567 --> 21:17.467
Ugh!

21:20.801 --> 21:23.434
You really feel
that way, Louie?

21:23.467 --> 21:24.934
Yes.

21:24.968 --> 21:28.133
You can't watch the
Mets without me?

21:33.067 --> 21:35.501
Nope.

21:35.534 --> 21:37.467
Well, I can't watch
them now, anyway,

21:37.501 --> 21:39.734
because it's the middle
of the winter.

21:42.067 --> 21:44.567
But the philosophy's
the same.

21:57.701 --> 22:00.400
You want
to see me again, Zena?

Oh, God.

out from under it.
