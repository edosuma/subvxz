[theme music]

01:01.662 --> 01:03.531
Mom wants you
to set the table.

01:03.631 --> 01:05.466
Working on my paper.

01:05.566 --> 01:06.367
Yeah, right.

01:06.467 --> 01:07.268
What's the topic?

01:07.368 --> 01:10.138
Larry, the unsung stooge?

01:10.238 --> 01:11.572
No.

01:11.672 --> 01:16.076
Columbus, heroic explorer
or scumball from Spain?

01:16.177 --> 01:18.479
Man, you must really want
to go to summer school, huh?

01:18.579 --> 01:19.713
Well, it's totally bogus.

01:19.813 --> 01:21.582
I mean, the guy
was a slave trader.

01:21.682 --> 01:22.783
Do they want the truth?

01:22.883 --> 01:25.486
Or do they just want me
to spit back the textbook?

01:25.586 --> 01:26.687
Well, who's the teacher?

01:26.787 --> 01:27.721
Grayson.

01:27.821 --> 01:31.058
Hmm, spit.

01:31.159 --> 01:33.026
High school's just learning
lies and telling lies.

01:33.127 --> 01:34.094
Really?

01:34.195 --> 01:35.263
Then how come you
ain't getting any A's?

01:37.898 --> 01:39.900
You know, we're gonna eat
dinner in about five minutes.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.069
And after two or three
helpings, people might notice

01:42.170 --> 01:44.037
that there's no silverware.

01:44.138 --> 01:46.740
One minute.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.942
Mmm, what smells good?

01:49.042 --> 01:52.079
Prime rib, baked potatoes,
and all the trimmings.

01:52.180 --> 01:53.080
Say, that does smell good.

01:53.181 --> 01:55.949
What are we having?

01:56.049 --> 01:59.187
Something I need scissors for.

01:59.287 --> 02:01.255
Darlene, set the table.

02:01.355 --> 02:03.023
DARLENE: Coming.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.058
So I got a call from
Stan Becker this morning.

02:05.159 --> 02:06.260
Oh, gee.

02:06.360 --> 02:09.397
Uh, that reminds me, Stan
Becker called yesterday.

02:09.497 --> 02:10.964
He mentioned that.

02:11.064 --> 02:13.601
Anyway, he's remodeling
the pizza barn,

02:13.701 --> 02:15.269
and his regular drywall
guy bailed on him.

02:15.369 --> 02:16.737
So he offered me a
buttload of money

02:16.837 --> 02:18.239
if I'd do the job for him.

02:18.339 --> 02:20.941
Well, I told him I
don't do that anymore.

02:21.041 --> 02:23.811
But he says he heard
things are slow at the shop

02:23.911 --> 02:27.147
and he's really in a bind,
and he made me promise

02:27.248 --> 02:28.682
to talk it over with you.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.150
So what do you think?

02:30.251 --> 02:31.419
Gee, sorry Dan.

02:31.519 --> 02:35.823
I kind of quit listening
right after buttload of money.

02:35.923 --> 02:37.391
OK, things are
slow at the shop.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.793
But if I start
drywalling again, I'll

02:39.893 --> 02:41.795
just fill like a total washout.

02:41.895 --> 02:44.498
Well, you know, we do
what we gotta do, Dan.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.834
If we didn't settle for
less every once in a while,

02:46.934 --> 02:50.671
me and you would be
married to other people.

02:50.771 --> 02:51.572
I just don't know.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.241
I got to think about it.

02:53.341 --> 02:55.042
Oh, don't do that.

02:55.142 --> 02:56.009
I'm serious, Darlene.

02:56.109 --> 02:58.512
Grayson's the
summer school king.

02:58.612 --> 02:59.747
You don't give
him what he wants,

02:59.847 --> 03:02.983
you're looking at eight
weeks in a moron steam bath.

03:03.083 --> 03:04.552
I don't know what
he wants, Becky.

03:04.652 --> 03:06.887
Well, it's easy.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.155
Let's see.

03:08.256 --> 03:10.958
Columbus was looking for a
new trade route to China.

03:11.058 --> 03:12.426
He found Salvador.

03:12.526 --> 03:15.429
And slaughtered, like,
thousands of people.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.764
Well, you can throw
that in, but don't

03:16.864 --> 03:19.166
make a big deal out of it.

03:19.267 --> 03:22.303
Look, Darlene, if you want, I'll
help you out with your paper

03:22.403 --> 03:23.871
after dinner, OK?

03:23.971 --> 03:25.973
Why are you doing this, Becky?

03:26.073 --> 03:28.008
'Cause you're my sister.

03:28.108 --> 03:30.010
And 'cause I don't want to
have to support you after Mom

03:30.110 --> 03:30.911
and Dad are dead.

03:31.011 --> 03:33.747
[music playing]

03:38.085 --> 03:40.754
Oh, don't you look cute?

03:40.854 --> 03:43.257
These overalls are
all stiff and scratchy.

03:43.357 --> 03:46.827
Well, that's 'cause we never
washed 'em after your last job.

03:46.927 --> 03:49.730
Now, once you get a good sweat
going, they'll loosen up.

03:49.830 --> 03:52.733
Now you play nice with all
those other little drywallers.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.568
There are no other drywallers.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.904
Just me and a wall and failure.

03:57.004 --> 03:59.707
OK, well, here's your lunch.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.942
Listen, thanks for juggling
your schedule at the mall

04:02.042 --> 04:02.976
so you could cover for me here.

04:03.076 --> 04:03.911
Oh, it's cool.

04:04.011 --> 04:04.912
I like it here.

04:05.012 --> 04:07.748
Nobody ever comes
in and bothers me.

04:07.848 --> 04:10.718
[music playing]

04:13.321 --> 04:14.154
Hey.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.055
ROSEANNE: Hey, girls.

04:15.155 --> 04:16.056
All right.

04:16.156 --> 04:17.991
With the box, it'll be 49.99.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.560
I'll go ahead and
pick up the tax.

04:19.660 --> 04:22.463
Well, we're kind of a little
short on cash right now.

04:22.563 --> 04:23.464
It's all right.

04:23.564 --> 04:24.532
I can wait.

04:24.632 --> 04:27.501
- Well, you will.
- I'll drop it by later.

04:27.601 --> 04:28.769
I'll see you later, Rosie.
ROSEANNE: OK.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.704
Thanks a lot, Barnie.
- Nice meeting you, Jackie.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.105
JACKIE: Yeah.
- Thanks, Barnie.

04:32.205 --> 04:33.040
Bye.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.708
Gee, no cash, huh?

04:34.808 --> 04:36.677
I guess I can't do
the grocery shopping.

04:36.777 --> 04:37.678
Ha, ha.

04:37.778 --> 04:40.314
Well, you're not
getting off that easy.

04:40.414 --> 04:41.382
Nope.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.651
I want you to also
stop by the drugstore.

04:43.751 --> 04:44.785
Here's the tickets.

04:44.885 --> 04:46.787
And pick up my
photos from Vegas.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.889
Is there anything else
I can do for you, Mother?

04:48.989 --> 04:49.990
Yeah.

04:50.090 --> 04:54.227
If you get a second,
um, dump that Mark guy.

04:54.328 --> 04:55.829
So you gonna tell her?

04:55.929 --> 04:56.697
No.

04:56.797 --> 04:57.665
ROSEANNE: What?

04:57.765 --> 04:59.367
- Nothing.
- Come on, Darlene.

04:59.467 --> 05:00.734
If I have to go to
court, then I'd better

05:00.834 --> 05:04.137
get something dry cleaned.

05:04.237 --> 05:06.874
She got a B on
her history paper.

05:06.974 --> 05:09.843
- A B?
- All right, Darlene!

05:09.943 --> 05:11.178
Let me see!
Let me see!

05:11.278 --> 05:12.312
It's not that big a deal.

05:12.413 --> 05:13.280
What are you talking about?

05:13.381 --> 05:14.181
It is so!

05:14.281 --> 05:15.148
It's a B!

05:15.248 --> 05:17.518
A B!

05:17.618 --> 05:22.856
A B. Becky, I want
you to go to the store

05:22.956 --> 05:26.026
and get a cake because we're
gonna have ourself a party.

05:26.126 --> 05:27.227
Aw, what the hell get.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.295
One that was baked today.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.433
Mom, stop it.

05:32.533 --> 05:33.333
Come on, Darlene.

05:33.434 --> 05:34.468
This is a great thing.

05:34.568 --> 05:35.869
I'm thinking of hanging
it up in the bathroom.

05:35.969 --> 05:39.873
You know, where your daddy
can sit and admire it.

05:39.973 --> 05:40.774
A B!

05:40.874 --> 05:43.511
On the road to honor roll!

05:43.611 --> 05:45.579
This is all such a load.

05:45.679 --> 05:46.614
What's the matter, Darlene?

05:46.714 --> 05:47.948
How come you're
not happy about it?

05:48.048 --> 05:49.983
Why would I'd be happy?

05:50.083 --> 05:51.318
Darlene, it was a good paper.

05:51.419 --> 05:53.554
Relax, OK?

05:53.654 --> 05:55.022
I guess you'd
know, wouldn't you?

05:55.122 --> 05:56.323
What's going on?

05:56.424 --> 05:57.625
Nothing.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.026
I just helped Darlene out
with her paper a little bit.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.260
She wrote the whole thing, OK?

06:00.360 --> 06:02.195
If you want to have a
party, have a party for her.

06:02.295 --> 06:03.096
I'll be in the car.

06:06.700 --> 06:07.635
You wrote it?

06:07.735 --> 06:08.536
Well, yeah.

06:08.636 --> 06:09.437
But I--

06:09.537 --> 06:12.540
You only got a B?

06:12.640 --> 06:13.907
What'd you do that for?

06:14.007 --> 06:15.809
I was trying to help her.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.578
Isn't that what we're all
supposed to be doing now?

06:17.678 --> 06:18.779
Helping Darlene?

06:18.879 --> 06:20.481
That doesn't help her, Becky.

06:20.581 --> 06:21.849
Darlene doesn't do anything.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.884
And now if you go doing
everything for her,

06:23.984 --> 06:26.053
she's never gonna
come out of this.

06:26.153 --> 06:28.055
I kept her from
flunking, Mother.

06:28.155 --> 06:31.258
No, she conned you into
doing it so she didn't have to.

06:31.358 --> 06:33.026
Even DJ could have
seen that coming.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.127
That's really stupid, Becky.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.028
Oh, great.

06:35.128 --> 06:36.630
I help her, and I get yelled at.

06:36.730 --> 06:37.965
This is so typical.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.767
Don't give me
that martyr crap.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.068
Well, when was
the last time you

06:41.168 --> 06:43.937
bought me a cake for
bringing home a decent grade

06:44.037 --> 06:46.940
or helping out DJ or
doing the laundry or any

06:47.040 --> 06:48.308
of the other million
things I do around

06:48.408 --> 06:51.945
here while Darlene sits around
and sucks up all the attention?

06:54.815 --> 06:55.749
Brother.

06:55.849 --> 06:56.650
Yeah.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.551
Oh, man.

06:57.651 --> 06:58.752
I really wanted that B!

06:58.852 --> 06:59.653
I really wanted that B!

06:59.753 --> 07:00.554
I know.

07:00.654 --> 07:01.455
I know.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.023
And you deserved it, Roseanne.

07:03.123 --> 07:06.627
You worked hard for it.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.128
My life is crap.

07:08.228 --> 07:10.030
Now, things will turn around.

07:10.130 --> 07:10.931
You'll see.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.500
Darlene'll be fine.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.535
And Dan will be fine.

07:14.635 --> 07:19.139
And we'll buy Becky a new
power tool, and she'll be fine!

07:19.239 --> 07:21.609
Jackie, would you
go across the street

07:21.709 --> 07:23.276
and get me a soda, please?
- Sure, yeah.

07:23.376 --> 07:24.211
Sure.

07:24.311 --> 07:26.079
Of course.
What do you want, huh?

07:26.179 --> 07:27.047
Something diet.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.683
Oh, don't make
it worse, Jackie.

07:29.783 --> 07:30.618
I'll be right back.

07:54.675 --> 07:55.643
Forgot my wallet.

08:05.352 --> 08:07.220
You OK?

08:07.320 --> 08:09.056
Yeah, you just scared me.
I just got scared.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.924
You need money?
Here, take my purse.

08:14.895 --> 08:15.996
You sure you're OK?

08:16.096 --> 08:17.364
Yeah.

08:17.464 --> 08:19.399
And bring back some ice.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.668
Why?

08:20.768 --> 08:23.604
Just bring back some cold ice.

08:23.704 --> 08:24.504
OK.

08:28.508 --> 08:31.845
[music playing]

08:42.222 --> 08:45.058
Mom, what's this word?

08:48.161 --> 08:50.330
"Handkerchief."

08:50.430 --> 08:51.832
You stink.

08:51.932 --> 08:53.000
I do not!

08:53.100 --> 08:55.235
You smell like smoke.

08:55.335 --> 08:57.070
Well, my hair was on fire.

09:15.122 --> 09:17.524
Damn.

09:17.625 --> 09:18.692
Hello.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.127
Hi.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.129
I didn't expect
you home so soon.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.997
No, me either.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.099
Finished a lot earlier
than I thought.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.500
How were things
at the shop today?

09:27.601 --> 09:29.236
Oh, slow.

09:29.336 --> 09:30.503
How as your day?

09:30.604 --> 09:32.339
Not nearly as
bad as I thought.

09:32.439 --> 09:34.574
Saw a lot of guys I
hadn't seen for a while.

09:34.675 --> 09:36.944
Stan offered me some
more work next week.

09:37.044 --> 09:37.845
I said no.

09:37.945 --> 09:38.846
He said please.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.447
I gave him an insanely
high estimate.

09:40.547 --> 09:41.682
He says OK.

09:41.782 --> 09:42.850
Hmm, well, good.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.184
Yeah.

09:44.284 --> 09:45.819
And the architect
stopped by the site.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.487
We were talking
about bikes, and he

09:47.587 --> 09:49.222
wants to come by and
check out that new Harley

09:49.322 --> 09:50.123
I just finished.

09:50.223 --> 09:52.292
So things could be a lot worse.

09:52.392 --> 09:53.694
That's great, Dan.

09:53.794 --> 09:56.129
And on the way home, I
stopped off at the shop.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.230
I checked out my new present.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.365
Oh, yeah?

09:58.465 --> 09:59.432
Me and Jackie thought
it'd be perfect for you.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.168
Did you like it?
- I loved it.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.202
Can you use it?

10:02.302 --> 10:03.270
Are you kidding?

10:03.370 --> 10:06.039
You can't build a
Quonset hut without one.

10:06.139 --> 10:08.909
Well, he said he'd
take it back if you want.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.077
No, no, no.

10:10.177 --> 10:10.978
It's special to me.

10:11.078 --> 10:11.945
Oh, listen.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.180
I wanted to ask
you one more thing.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.314
ROSEANNE: Yeah, what's that?

10:14.414 --> 10:16.216
Are you smoking menthol
or those charcoal tips?

10:20.187 --> 10:22.289
I'm not smoking.

10:22.389 --> 10:23.556
Oh, come on, Roseanne.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.092
Your hair smells like smoke.
- Well, people--

10:25.192 --> 10:26.193
- Your clothes smell like smoke.
- --in a restaurant smoke.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.594
And the toothpaste
and the mouthwash?

10:27.695 --> 10:29.129
And people at the shop-- well,
nine out of 10 dentists say--

10:29.229 --> 10:30.030
How long?

10:33.566 --> 10:34.367
OK.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.469
Well, I don't know.

10:36.569 --> 10:39.873
Ever since, uh, I had to buy
Becky birth control pills.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.275
Ever since Darlene turned
into vegetable dip.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.011
Ever since you opened that shop.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.046
Ever since I have
to work two jobs.

10:46.146 --> 10:49.950
It's just been a
real sucky year, Dan.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.452
I mean, you know, it's
either smoke or eat.

10:52.552 --> 10:54.187
You don't want me to gain
back all the weight I lost.

10:54.287 --> 10:55.088
Oh, heck no.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.123
You're right.

10:56.223 --> 10:57.224
Keep smoking.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.492
I like my women skinny
and hocking up tar.

10:59.592 --> 11:00.894
Well, gee.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.930
You know, I mean, it's not like
you don't come home every night

11:03.030 --> 11:05.165
and have two or three beers.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.599
- You're right.
- Yeah.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.301
And-- and it's not like
you don't sit out there

11:08.401 --> 11:09.970
in the living room
in front of the TV

11:10.070 --> 11:11.705
and pig out on all this garbage.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.106
No argument there.

11:13.206 --> 11:15.408
Well, so where do you get off
being all high and mighty like?

11:15.508 --> 11:16.777
I don't smoke.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.445
You're the one that taught
me to smoke in the first place.

11:18.545 --> 11:19.913
I'm also the one
that made you quit.

11:20.013 --> 11:20.948
Well, I'm gonna quit again.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.816
When?

11:22.916 --> 11:24.852
I'll get back to you.

11:24.952 --> 11:26.686
When?

11:26.787 --> 11:28.588
I just got to make it
through the holidays.

11:28.688 --> 11:32.025
I'm also the one that
came up with that excuse.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.426
I said I'm gonna quit!

11:33.526 --> 11:35.128
Why should I believe you?

11:35.228 --> 11:37.164
What, now you're
calling me a liar?

11:37.264 --> 11:39.733
You've been smoking behind my
back for how many months now?

11:39.833 --> 11:43.170
Well, does that
make me a liar.

11:43.270 --> 11:44.637
Oh, wait a minute.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.106
What does it make you?

11:46.206 --> 11:47.607
Sneaky.

11:47.707 --> 11:51.111
[music playing]

11:53.213 --> 11:55.282
You did too order salami.

11:55.382 --> 11:56.483
Yes, you did!

11:56.583 --> 11:57.617
Yes, you did!

11:57.717 --> 12:01.188
Then why'd you take a
big old bite out of it?

12:01.288 --> 12:04.992
Oh, she's doing
much better, Dan.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.960
ROSEANNE: Eat it or wear it!

12:07.060 --> 12:08.829
Well, she's a little cranky.

12:08.929 --> 12:11.598
But I haven't let her have
a cigarette all day long.

12:11.698 --> 12:12.499
Hey, no problem.

12:12.599 --> 12:14.267
She's my friend.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.003
Oh, just sit
there chatting away

12:16.103 --> 12:19.339
while I run the whole damn
restaurant all by myself.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.008
Look, I got to go.

12:21.108 --> 12:22.109
Check back with me later, OK?

12:22.209 --> 12:23.410
Bye.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.112
Oh, do you work here?

12:25.212 --> 12:28.081
Oh, are you having
another nicotine fit?

12:28.181 --> 12:29.382
Yeah.

12:29.482 --> 12:30.317
I guess so.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.618
Sorry.
Give me a minute.

12:31.718 --> 12:32.519
I know it'll pass.

12:35.388 --> 12:37.757
Look, why don't
you just relax?

12:37.858 --> 12:39.259
Tell you what-- you
make the coffee,

12:39.359 --> 12:40.560
and I'll take that
table over there.

12:40.660 --> 12:41.461
Oh, sure.

12:41.561 --> 12:44.431
Just hog all the tips.

12:44.531 --> 12:45.532
Where's your
uniform, Roseanne?

12:55.108 --> 12:56.209
Can I help you?

12:56.309 --> 12:57.610
Uh, yeah.

12:57.710 --> 13:01.248
Which is better, the tuna
salad or the egg salad?

13:01.348 --> 13:03.250
Tuna salad, egg
salad, chicken salad,

13:03.350 --> 13:05.152
turkey salad, shrimp salad--
what difference does it make?

13:05.252 --> 13:07.354
It's all just different
words for mayonnaise.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.522
Pick one.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.024
Excuse us.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.326
Well, that certainly was an
ugly little incident there,

13:13.426 --> 13:14.627
wasn't it, Roseanne?

13:14.727 --> 13:16.263
Well, I'm trying
to quit smoking,

13:16.363 --> 13:18.598
and it's just really, really
hard in the beginning!

13:18.698 --> 13:19.499
I didn't know you smoked.

13:19.599 --> 13:20.533
Yeah.

13:20.633 --> 13:21.969
I quit, like, nine
years ago, you know.

13:22.069 --> 13:24.137
But I had a really rough
year, so then I started again,

13:24.237 --> 13:25.638
and now it's like
I never even quit!

13:25.738 --> 13:27.107
And Dan's all ticked off at me--
- Whoops.

13:27.207 --> 13:28.308
--and I'm under
all this pressure.

13:28.408 --> 13:29.442
Whoops.
I'm sorry.

13:29.542 --> 13:34.047
My fault. I expressed an
interest in your life.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.949
I had that coming.

13:36.049 --> 13:40.253
What I meant to say, Roseanne,
is that this is a luncheonette,

13:40.353 --> 13:42.956
not the Betty Ford Clinic!

13:43.056 --> 13:44.557
Be psychotic on your own time.

13:47.995 --> 13:48.795
I'm on a break.

13:54.935 --> 13:57.537
Believe it or not,
Roseanne, you're gonna be OK.

13:57.637 --> 14:00.740
Hey, this is worse
than PMS, all right?

14:00.840 --> 14:02.876
With PMS, it only
lasts a couple of days,

14:02.976 --> 14:05.278
and it's way worse on everybody
else than it is on me.

14:05.378 --> 14:07.314
OK?

14:07.414 --> 14:10.083
I know how you feel.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.784
I know you're my friend.
I know.

14:11.885 --> 14:12.920
Oh, I got to go to the bathroom.

14:13.020 --> 14:13.987
Could you cover for me?

14:14.087 --> 14:14.888
Sure, OK.

14:14.988 --> 14:15.855
You got it.

14:18.791 --> 14:20.260
Let me see that purse.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.261
There's nothing in there!

14:21.361 --> 14:22.262
You don't have to look.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.163
Well, just let me look!

14:23.263 --> 14:24.397
No, you don't have to look.

14:24.497 --> 14:25.298
Roseanne!

14:25.398 --> 14:26.533
No, stay out of it!

14:26.633 --> 14:28.268
Why do you have to take
your purse to the bathroom?

14:28.368 --> 14:30.170
That's none of your beeswax!

14:30.270 --> 14:33.974
OK, I think it is time that
we all put our heads on our desk

14:34.074 --> 14:35.976
and had a little quiet time.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.744
She won't let me
go to the bathroom!

14:37.844 --> 14:38.811
Roseanne--

14:38.912 --> 14:42.082
She's-- she's got
cigarettes in her purse.

14:42.182 --> 14:43.350
Roseanne, then
go to the bathroom.

14:43.450 --> 14:44.584
The purse stays here.

14:44.684 --> 14:46.586
Fine!

14:46.686 --> 14:47.988
I'll just get my coat.

14:48.088 --> 14:48.956
Roseanne.

14:49.056 --> 14:52.325
[music playing]

14:57.697 --> 14:59.866
Darlene, could you give
me a hand folding these?

14:59.967 --> 15:01.001
Not my turn.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.235
Oh, come on, Darlene.

15:02.335 --> 15:03.903
I got to pick up DJ
at soccer practice,

15:04.004 --> 15:05.172
and I still got two more loads.

15:05.272 --> 15:07.007
It's the least you can do.

15:07.107 --> 15:07.907
No.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.009
This is the least I could do.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.715
You are such an ass.

15:15.815 --> 15:17.317
I thought you weren't
talking to me, Becky.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.218
You know, I don't--

15:18.318 --> 15:19.619
I don't believe you, Darlene.

15:19.719 --> 15:21.454
I help you out with your paper,
and you get me nailed for it?

15:21.554 --> 15:23.656
Look, I apologized
for that yesterday.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.225
Besides, I didn't
ask for your help.

15:25.325 --> 15:26.226
You just felt sorry for me.

15:26.326 --> 15:27.560
And I don't need your damn pity.

15:27.660 --> 15:28.461
Are you kidding?

15:28.561 --> 15:30.330
You're begging for it!

15:30.430 --> 15:32.332
Oh, high school's too hard.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.900
My friends don't like me.

15:34.001 --> 15:36.003
Nobody understands me.

15:36.103 --> 15:38.005
Well, then, do something
about it, you little wimp!

15:38.105 --> 15:39.106
Shut up, Becky!

15:39.206 --> 15:40.273
You don't know what
you're talking about!

15:40.373 --> 15:42.442
Oh, of course not.

15:42.542 --> 15:43.977
Because you're so complex.

15:44.077 --> 15:45.545
You're so deep.

15:45.645 --> 15:48.315
Well, that's crap.

15:48.415 --> 15:49.649
You're just a
whiny little basket

15:49.749 --> 15:51.118
case who's milking
this depression

15:51.218 --> 15:53.486
thing for all it's worth.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.288
So here it is, 4:00
in the afternoon,

15:55.388 --> 15:57.157
and you get to do
exactly what you want.

15:57.257 --> 15:59.426
Well, way to go.

15:59.526 --> 16:01.628
Now excuse me, but I got a
zillion chores to do or Mom

16:01.728 --> 16:04.597
and Dad are gonna kick my butt.

16:04.697 --> 16:08.068
[music playing]

16:12.605 --> 16:14.007
Oh, it was a bad day.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.308
I know.

16:15.408 --> 16:16.909
A bad, bad day.

16:17.010 --> 16:17.977
I know.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.946
Oh, bad day.

16:20.047 --> 16:22.415
I know.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.151
Oh, go on.

16:24.251 --> 16:25.752
Tell me what happened.

16:25.852 --> 16:28.688
Oh, then I called
Leon a giant doody face,

16:28.788 --> 16:30.790
and he sent me home.

16:30.890 --> 16:32.492
Did you smoke?

16:32.592 --> 16:34.361
No, I didn't smoke.

16:34.461 --> 16:38.098
I did, however, eat
7,000 pickle chips.

16:38.198 --> 16:39.132
Thanks for the warning, dear.

16:42.502 --> 16:46.239
I'm an obsessive compulsive
addictive mess, Dan.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.075
I can't do anything
just a little bit.

16:48.175 --> 16:49.942
I find something I like,
and then I totally overdo

16:50.043 --> 16:53.080
it, like smoking, eating.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.515
Thank god for birth control.

16:55.615 --> 16:58.518
Amen.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.853
I just don't know if
I can quit this time.

17:00.953 --> 17:02.689
I mean, last time I quit,
I had a really good reason.

17:02.789 --> 17:03.756
I was pregnant with DJ.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.426
But what reason do I have now?

17:06.526 --> 17:07.927
Because I love you
and I want you to be

17:08.027 --> 17:10.497
with me for a long, long time.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.199
We're talking
about me now, Dan.

17:14.467 --> 17:15.302
Sorry.

17:15.402 --> 17:17.437
I was just trying
to be wonderful.

17:17.537 --> 17:18.338
I know.

17:18.438 --> 17:19.272
And you are.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.441
The problem's just me.

17:21.541 --> 17:22.375
I blame the kids.

17:22.475 --> 17:23.276
I blame money.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.312
But that's all bull.

17:25.412 --> 17:26.213
The problem's me.

17:26.313 --> 17:27.947
I'm just weak.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.749
And that's why I married
you, because you're

17:29.849 --> 17:30.783
so weak and frail.

17:33.486 --> 17:34.287
Don't mind me.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.988
Just came to get the hamper.

17:36.089 --> 17:36.989
Continue with your foreplay.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.568
Why are you
getting the hamper?

17:48.668 --> 17:49.602
DARLENE: To do the laundry.

17:49.702 --> 17:51.338
I thought it was Becky's day.

17:51.438 --> 17:52.405
Yeah, well, I owe her one.

17:56.376 --> 17:57.410
I owe her one, too, Dan.

17:57.510 --> 17:58.311
Get off me!

18:08.054 --> 18:10.290
Hey.

18:10.390 --> 18:13.193
What are you doing?

18:13.293 --> 18:19.098
I put gas in the car, picked
up DJ from soccer practice.

18:19.199 --> 18:21.701
Now I'm doing nothing.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.936
Is that OK?

18:24.036 --> 18:26.273
Cool.

18:26.373 --> 18:31.278
Well, I sure yelled
at you yesterday, huh?

18:31.378 --> 18:32.712
For no reason.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.114
Well, for no good reason.

18:35.215 --> 18:38.218
You should have been
yelling at Darlene.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.187
Well, you know, I would
love to yell Darlene.

18:40.287 --> 18:42.822
But she would just go
up in her room and hide.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.957
I like yelling at you
more 'cause you're fun.

18:45.057 --> 18:45.858
You yell back.

18:49.496 --> 18:51.097
I was trying to help.

18:51.198 --> 18:52.532
I know it.

18:52.632 --> 18:55.535
And you just gave
me grief for it.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.103
I know.

18:57.204 --> 19:00.307
Well, you're always tip-toeing
around Darlene, you know?

19:00.407 --> 19:03.142
Nobody wants to upset her.

19:03.243 --> 19:06.679
So I do everything
and get nothing.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.315
You are right.

19:11.284 --> 19:12.084
So what do I get?

19:14.887 --> 19:17.123
You're just gonna go
right for it, aren't you?

19:17.224 --> 19:20.660
Well, it kind of
feels like my moment.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.396
Well, what do you want?

19:23.496 --> 19:25.832
I-- I'd really like
it if you'd invite

19:25.932 --> 19:27.767
Mark to Thanksgiving.

19:27.867 --> 19:31.538
You know, let him
meet the family,

19:31.638 --> 19:32.439
kind of make it official.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.409
How about cash?

19:36.509 --> 19:39.412
Mother.

19:39.512 --> 19:40.947
OK.

19:41.047 --> 19:43.750
But he is neither to smoke
nor to have sex with you

19:43.850 --> 19:45.518
in my house.

19:45.618 --> 19:46.553
Deal.

19:46.653 --> 19:47.454
Good.

19:55.395 --> 19:56.429
I don't need cigarettes, man.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.531
My kids will kill me.

[music playing]

20:06.439 --> 20:07.874
Do we really have
to watch this movie?

20:07.974 --> 20:10.510
It's a classic, Roseanne.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.044
Everybody's smoking!
Look at that.

20:12.144 --> 20:13.446
How come they get to
smoke, and I don't?

20:13.546 --> 20:15.748
'Cause they-- they didn't
know anything in the '30s.

20:15.848 --> 20:19.919
I mean, look, the-- the
men are all wearing hats.

20:20.019 --> 20:22.389
They're sure enjoying smoking
them cigarettes, ain't they?

20:22.489 --> 20:26.225
Well, they're
probably all dead now.

20:26.326 --> 20:29.596
So maybe the hats killed 'em.

20:29.696 --> 20:30.830
I want a cigarette.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.064
No.

20:32.164 --> 20:33.666
Have another carrot.

20:33.766 --> 20:36.135
Thanks.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.270
So how long's it been?

20:37.370 --> 20:39.038
Four days.

20:39.138 --> 20:43.175
Well, I guess I just
never really understood

20:43.276 --> 20:44.544
the whole addiction thing.

20:44.644 --> 20:47.947
I mean, I know when I had
to quit, it was no big deal.

20:48.047 --> 20:53.052
And never felt the urge
to go back to it again.

20:53.152 --> 20:53.953
Well, good for you!

20:59.859 --> 21:01.794
We shouldn't even be
sitting here watching TV.

21:01.894 --> 21:04.464
TV's the whole way
my whole generation

21:04.564 --> 21:05.365
learned to smoke, anyhow.

21:05.465 --> 21:06.265
Oh, come on, Roseanne.

21:06.366 --> 21:08.368
It's true, Jackie.

21:08.468 --> 21:09.736
Lucy smoked.

21:09.836 --> 21:11.270
Desi smoked.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.840
Ward smoked.

21:13.940 --> 21:16.976
Uh, "Make Room
for Daddy" smoked.

21:17.076 --> 21:20.580
Gomez and Morticia smoked.

21:20.680 --> 21:24.517
Maxwell Smart smoked,
99, the chief.

21:24.617 --> 21:28.521
Hymie, and he was a
robot, but he smoked.

21:28.621 --> 21:29.856
Patty smoked.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.257
Cathy didn't.

21:31.358 --> 21:34.894
I know, but they made
her into a huge nerd.

21:34.994 --> 21:36.529
Rob smoked.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.698
Laura smoked.

21:38.798 --> 21:42.068
Buddy, Sally, Jerry.

21:42.168 --> 21:45.037
Millie smoked.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.974
I don't know about Samantha,
but both Darrens smoked.
