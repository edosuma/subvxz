00:42.960 --> 00:45.543
We've got to go, George.
The <i>Darwin</i> won't unload itself.

00:45.629 --> 00:47.119
Just 10 more minutes.

00:47.172 --> 00:49.334
I promised I'd wait as long as I could.

00:51.218 --> 00:55.712
<i>It was time to return
to the place that I called home.</i>

00:55.806 --> 00:59.344
<i>Grief had kept me absent for too long.</i>

00:59.476 --> 01:01.808
<i>And if my healing was not complete,</i>

01:02.312 --> 01:05.976
<i>I could picture a day
when it might be so.</i>

01:06.066 --> 01:10.526
<i>Now I needed to be
with the friends I loved</i>

01:10.654 --> 01:13.521
<i>and return to the work that defined me.</i>

01:16.159 --> 01:17.866
George!

01:21.373 --> 01:23.990
<i>Midwifery is about separation,</i>

01:24.084 --> 01:28.999
<i>physically dividing into two
that which has been one for nine months.</i>

01:30.340 --> 01:33.674
<i>There is beauty and relief
in the cleaving.</i>

01:34.386 --> 01:37.504
<i>There is labour but there is reward.</i>

01:37.598 --> 01:38.679
That's it.

01:41.435 --> 01:44.052
<i>I had survived a wound,</i>

01:44.187 --> 01:47.771
<i>a loss that ripped my heart
and made it bleed.</i>

01:48.108 --> 01:49.189
Come.

01:49.234 --> 01:50.565
Hello, stranger!

01:50.694 --> 01:52.731
You're quite the act to follow,
Jenny Lee.

01:53.071 --> 01:55.688
<i>Restored to Nonnatus House,</i>

01:55.741 --> 01:57.573
<i>I was safe in harbour.</i>

01:58.952 --> 02:01.284
We're very close now.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.070
Breathe gently, Pamela.

02:05.292 --> 02:06.623
That's the stuff.

02:11.381 --> 02:12.462
Nurse Miller.

02:13.467 --> 02:14.798
- Oh!
- Gently.

02:15.552 --> 02:16.963
Don't push!

02:17.804 --> 02:19.761
It's a caulbearer.

02:19.890 --> 02:22.222
Born in the amniotic sac.

02:22.309 --> 02:26.473
A mermaid's purse full of luck,
according to the old wives' tale.

02:26.730 --> 02:28.266
I've only heard about them.

02:35.906 --> 02:37.112
A perfect little girl.

02:38.283 --> 02:41.992
In olden times, they dried the caul
and sold it to a sailor

02:42.579 --> 02:43.944
to keep him safe.

02:45.082 --> 02:46.072
It's a great prize.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.329
I want to keep it for my George.

02:50.087 --> 02:53.079
He's out all hours on the river
as a lighter man.

02:53.131 --> 02:55.122
Every one of them's an age to me.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.300
On the chest of drawers, Nurse.

03:06.436 --> 03:07.676
Green for a girl.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.763
Light it for me, would you?
Hang it in the window for my George.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.607
He said he'd wait as long as he could.

03:16.655 --> 03:19.113
Nurse Miller and I will take it
in turns to visit.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.774
You'll be well looked after, Pamela.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.869
A girl. Yes!

03:34.548 --> 03:35.663
Yes!

03:49.479 --> 03:50.685
Mater.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.472
Oh, Camilla.

03:54.651 --> 03:58.360
I see that grace does not grow
exponentially with age.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.041
Jenny, you must have
your old room back.

04:17.173 --> 04:19.916
Honestly, I'm more than happy
in the box room.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.671
I've rather got used to having my own.

04:22.179 --> 04:23.920
Chichester's changed you.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.846
Though I shan't miss the snoring.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.388
You'll be able
to get to the mirror.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.099
What a treat!

04:29.603 --> 04:32.345
Do you really have to head off so soon?

04:32.439 --> 04:34.726
I don't like the thought of you
surrounded by strangers.

04:34.858 --> 04:37.520
Yes. You're sure you're ready
for secondment to the London?

04:37.569 --> 04:39.526
You'll have to hit the ground running.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.900
I just can't quite pick up
where I left off.

04:42.032 --> 04:45.775
This way, no one will ask me how I am
and no one will feel sorry for me.

04:45.869 --> 04:48.952
Hurry up, then.
It's the London, not Butlins.

04:49.039 --> 04:51.030
You're to collect your uniform
when you arrive.

04:52.042 --> 04:55.706
Oh, and, uh, Nurse Lee,
you've been missed.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.082
Greatly.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.732
Good. Just relax.

05:24.241 --> 05:26.232
Nurse Lee?

05:26.284 --> 05:27.900
Very pleased to have you with us.

05:29.412 --> 05:33.280
It's, uh, rather different
to district midwifery.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.077
Out there we can't look after them,

05:35.168 --> 05:38.081
can't stop their glorious leaders
asking for dinner on the table

05:38.171 --> 05:39.457
or their smalls to be washed.

05:39.589 --> 05:41.830
But here they can rest.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.925
We have two women in early labour
admitted overnight.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.756
You'll find their notes on my desk.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.421
Your priority is to ensure

05:48.473 --> 05:51.135
that they move swiftly
to the labour ward as they progress.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.183
Please excuse me.

05:59.442 --> 06:00.432
Mrs Halford?

06:05.115 --> 06:09.359
We wondered whether you might care
to supper with us? Tomorrow, perhaps?

06:10.662 --> 06:13.279
An evening of jellied eels?

06:13.331 --> 06:14.787
I think not.

06:19.462 --> 06:22.295
I suppose your week
is full of frightfully exciting plans?

06:24.301 --> 06:25.837
I'm here for rather longer.

06:28.847 --> 06:31.509
Permanently, in fact.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.799
Madeira's never really suited me.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.476
But Pater adores it.

06:35.520 --> 06:38.137
That's why he's staying there.

06:38.189 --> 06:39.725
We're going our separate ways.

06:41.735 --> 06:42.896
But why?

06:45.071 --> 06:46.812
I'm tired of living alone.

06:48.158 --> 06:51.992
Your father has many... interests.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.033
I'm not one of them.

06:56.207 --> 06:57.322
For you, madam.

07:03.256 --> 07:06.169
Oh, Lord, Mater, your watch.
It must have come loose.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.500
- Oh, heavens. We'll find it.
- Oh, sit down, Camilla.

07:08.887 --> 07:10.423
It's not lost.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.264
I have no need of a diamond watch,

07:14.351 --> 07:16.058
far greater need of its value.

07:17.687 --> 07:21.851
Mater, you can't mean... You've sold it?

07:22.859 --> 07:25.226
You were not brought up to pry.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.195
Please, come to supper with us tomorrow.

07:32.535 --> 07:35.869
Whatever's going on,
surely we might help.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.071
We're your family.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.706
And it would give you a chance
to finally meet Freddie.

07:42.712 --> 07:45.044
I really can't get used to that name.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.544
After the handyman, you said?

08:00.647 --> 08:02.388
It's for her caul, when it's ready.

08:03.566 --> 08:06.399
So you can have a bit of us with you,
wherever you are.

08:06.945 --> 08:09.061
A mermaid birth.

08:10.907 --> 08:13.399
Mum always said
you could have too much luck.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.571
Spoils you.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.076
Well, I want to be spoilt.

08:17.122 --> 08:19.739
I want five more babies.

08:19.833 --> 08:23.997
And I want dogs and cats and a budgie.

08:24.921 --> 08:27.253
I want our family
bursting at the seams, George.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.456
All right.

08:29.592 --> 08:32.583
All right, then, if you say so.

08:34.179 --> 08:36.672
And I'll keep you safe
as long as I live.

08:39.644 --> 08:40.929
Well, I mean, you better.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.638
I married you for them strong arms,
not your personality.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.478
Morning, Mrs Saint.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.057
Uh, my milk won't come.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.308
Nothing to worry about.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.149
It always takes a little while.

09:33.239 --> 09:36.322
And you know how to top up.
She'll do perfectly well with water.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.405
It's just at the Mothercraft,

09:39.496 --> 09:41.203
they said it's the way
we'll form our bond,

09:41.331 --> 09:42.662
it's how she'll know me.

09:42.707 --> 09:45.324
And, well, if it won't come, she can't.

09:45.376 --> 09:48.164
That's not quite what we meant.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.497
And we certainly wouldn't expect
your milk to be in yet.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.426
I don't want her having the water.

09:56.513 --> 09:59.505
I read about what
the Metropolitan Water Board do

09:59.599 --> 10:02.182
and they say that we drink the same
glass of water at least three times,

10:02.227 --> 10:05.345
it passes straight through us.

10:29.796 --> 10:32.584
Please calm down.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.456
You don't even know
your mother will come.

10:34.551 --> 10:36.041
But if she comes,

10:36.094 --> 10:39.803
do you really think anything less
than spit spot will pass muster?

10:40.557 --> 10:43.219
And I have to telephone my father.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.305
Which is akin to summoning Churchill.

10:46.146 --> 10:49.309
You'll feel more comfortable
when you've spoken to him.

10:49.399 --> 10:52.733
In the meantime, we don't need
to turn the entire house upside down.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.645
Auntie Mary gave us that!

10:56.739 --> 10:57.900
Oh, and he's perfectly charming

10:57.949 --> 11:01.067
but now he needs a little nap
in the cupboard.

11:05.331 --> 11:08.244
You're embarrassed by our home.

11:08.334 --> 11:11.497
I just want her
to like something about me.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.417
Even if it's simply my curtains.

11:26.978 --> 11:29.595
I wish you didn't care, Camilla.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.681
I wish you saw yourself as I do.

11:52.295 --> 11:54.627
Patrick, I feel like I'm pestering you,

11:55.173 --> 11:57.039
but I do need the details
of your referee.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.959
Oh, terrible game, we lost two-nil.

12:00.011 --> 12:01.843
I wouldn't recommend him.

12:01.971 --> 12:04.804
I'm sure the Church of England
Children's Society will be thrilled

12:04.849 --> 12:07.136
how seriously you're taking
the adoption process.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.139
I'm handing the forms in today.

12:10.521 --> 12:12.512
Frank Higginson.

12:12.649 --> 12:16.233
We served in Italy together.
He's in my book. Second drawer down.

12:22.659 --> 12:24.491
- Sorry, Nurse.
- It's quite all right.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.033
- I really am sorry.
- Accidents happen.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.028
It's all good training
for having a family.

12:29.082 --> 12:34.168
For people with families
or who are indeed planning for them.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.417
Or nurses with scrupulous attention
to the cleanliness of their floors.

12:37.507 --> 12:39.669
I was going for the more abstract route.

12:39.717 --> 12:42.379
I'm after some orange juice.
I've a Bible class.

12:42.512 --> 12:43.718
It's a good carrot.

12:43.846 --> 12:46.178
A reward for making it
through Corinthians.

12:46.224 --> 12:48.556
- I wondered if you...
- I'm sure we can spare some.

12:48.685 --> 12:50.767
The class. It's this evening.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.395
- I'm not really one for Bibles.
- I meant after.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.774
Dinner? A walk?

13:00.446 --> 13:01.527
Or the dance?

13:01.614 --> 13:04.026
- Well, I hadn't really considered...
- I usually go at 7:00.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.740
All ready for Mrs Rawle?

13:11.249 --> 13:14.537
I see from her notes she delivered
stillborn on her first pregnancy.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.544
That's why she's in early,
for observation.

13:18.089 --> 13:21.047
Do we know whether Mrs Halford
delivered safely this morning?

13:21.134 --> 13:22.750
- I haven't heard.
- Why would you?

13:23.636 --> 13:25.422
If we began to
cross-pollinate with postnatal,

13:25.555 --> 13:27.216
we'd very quickly be in a pickle.

13:28.433 --> 13:31.391
I still marvel at all this,
free of charge.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.557
<i>I lost my mother 30 years ago.</i>

13:34.647 --> 13:36.638
She died in childbirth with my brother.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.141
My father couldn't afford a doctor.

13:40.236 --> 13:42.273
Now look at us.

13:42.405 --> 13:45.238
Come along in. Mrs Rawle, we don't bite.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.777
She's had lunch.
Uh, touch dizzy this morning.

13:49.912 --> 13:51.744
She tossed and turned a bit last night.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.245
I think we'll manage.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.414
You'll be well looked after, love.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.667
You'd hope so.

13:57.754 --> 14:00.121
We pay enough
to the National Insurance Scheme.

14:00.923 --> 14:03.005
Thank you.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.582
I'm Nurse Lee.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.588
Let's get you settled.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.671
Not wishing to be rude,
but I'd be much happier with a doctor.

14:10.141 --> 14:12.473
I'm afraid
you'll have to make do with me.

14:12.602 --> 14:16.470
I'll organise a bath for you,
pop your things in the locker.

14:16.606 --> 14:18.938
We'll store your case and coat.

14:33.664 --> 14:35.200
It's new.

14:35.291 --> 14:36.952
My case.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.116
Do be careful with it.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.952
I don't want it in a heap.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.455
We're careful with everything,
Mrs Rawle.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.804
Mrs Saint!

14:59.190 --> 15:00.726
What on earth's going on?

15:00.817 --> 15:02.399
Oh, well, there's all this dust.

15:02.485 --> 15:04.977
I don't want my Rose taking it in.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.394
I need to get them curtains down.

15:06.489 --> 15:09.322
There was a fog last night,
brings the spores in.

15:09.659 --> 15:11.866
Mrs Saint, you need to rest.

15:11.994 --> 15:16.864
Oh, no, I need a clean house for my baby
so I can relax, so my milk will come.

15:16.999 --> 15:20.333
Mrs Saint, it's normal for it to come
when baby's three or four days old.

15:20.878 --> 15:22.334
Rest will only help.

15:23.714 --> 15:26.331
I'm not tired and there's so much to do.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.838
- You just help me with the chest.
- Into bed.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.552
What about having your mother to stay?

15:31.681 --> 15:33.843
I know she's in Harlow
but it wouldn't be hard to arrange

15:34.058 --> 15:35.719
and she'd be a great help to you.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.766
It...

15:40.857 --> 15:42.848
It's scaring her.

15:42.942 --> 15:46.936
- Your headdress, the way it flaps.
- I'm sorry, little one,

15:47.029 --> 15:49.737
but a promise to our Lord
transcends even you.

15:50.241 --> 15:53.108
Think about having your mother.

16:06.048 --> 16:09.382
- Your hands are shaking.
- Just a bit fiddly, that's all.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.546
A heck of a lot of salmon for two.

16:15.808 --> 16:16.889
She may come.

16:20.563 --> 16:24.227
Peter, if you'd heard Father
when I telephoned him.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.103
80 cold.

16:26.235 --> 16:27.817
He's cut her off without a penny.

16:28.112 --> 16:30.729
- Well, she did up and leave.
- 'Cause she's so bally lonely.

16:30.781 --> 16:32.647
You don't know that for sure.

16:32.742 --> 16:35.734
She's alone and without funds.
That much I do know.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.083
Oh, good Lord! She's come.

16:49.926 --> 16:51.416
How's my girls?

16:53.095 --> 16:55.632
You have to stop her, okay?
You have to stop her coming here.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.927
'Cause she's trying
to turn Rose against me.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.348
So you have to stop her.

16:59.435 --> 17:03.929
Love? What's all this?
What are you on about?

17:10.988 --> 17:14.356
Well, Lady Browne,
what do you think of our little chap?

17:15.785 --> 17:19.493
I find infant charms
somewhat exaggerated.

17:20.455 --> 17:23.618
So uninspiring until they can converse.

17:23.667 --> 17:28.162
He may yet inherit
some of my father's talent for politics.

17:28.297 --> 17:31.835
Goodness knows the country's in need
of a decent politician.

17:36.973 --> 17:38.384
I'll take Freddie up.

17:39.976 --> 17:42.468
Come on, mate. Up we go.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.815
Really, Camilla,

17:49.902 --> 17:53.145
a man doesn't come home
to be a nursemaid to his child.

17:53.656 --> 17:56.193
Peter adores being with Freddie.

17:58.703 --> 18:02.241
- I spoke with Father today.
- I asked you not to pry.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.410
I'm worried.

18:05.668 --> 18:08.376
You cannot have the funds to manage,
certainly not at The Savoy.

18:08.504 --> 18:10.666
But I am not at The Savoy.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.713
I'm at a dear little place in Bayswater.

18:13.009 --> 18:14.920
You need not concern yourself.

18:15.678 --> 18:18.921
Let us not poke at wounds
we cannot heal.

18:26.022 --> 18:27.512
Mrs Rawle, what is it?

18:27.565 --> 18:28.771
My baby's heartbeat,

18:29.108 --> 18:30.598
it's not been checked for a while.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.571
Checked at 4:00 pm.
All perfectly normal.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.862
I want it checked again.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.568
He's gone ever so quiet.

18:43.205 --> 18:45.367
I'll fetch my Pinard,
have a little listen,

18:45.458 --> 18:46.698
put our minds at rest.

18:47.293 --> 18:51.207
Nurse Lee, we check baby's heartbeat
every four hours.

18:51.255 --> 18:53.622
Any more is wholly unnecessary.

18:53.716 --> 18:55.457
We are not here to indulge.

19:06.562 --> 19:07.893
Mr Saint?

19:10.107 --> 19:12.565
Whatever is the matter?

19:12.610 --> 19:15.568
Don't know how to say, Nurse.

19:23.788 --> 19:25.950
Pamela's become very upset.

19:27.458 --> 19:31.247
Mr Saint says you insisted
her mother come to stay?

19:31.295 --> 19:34.583
It seems their relationship
is very fragile.

19:34.632 --> 19:37.420
I suggested it.
I certainly didn't mean to upset her.

19:37.468 --> 19:40.631
I think the whole business of feeding
is worrying her unduly.

19:40.763 --> 19:43.926
She seems to believe it's becoming
a barrier between her and Rose.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.757
That's exactly what I mean.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.137
I'll talk to her tomorrow.

19:48.104 --> 19:50.596
Mr Saint asked that I visit.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.647
Of course. We'll go together.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.522
In place of you.

20:18.884 --> 20:21.342
What a magnificent beast.

20:22.972 --> 20:25.839
The smallest amount, if you would.

20:33.399 --> 20:36.642
- How is the weather in Madeira?
- Cloudy

20:37.528 --> 20:39.485
but unburdened by smog.

20:41.866 --> 20:44.824
I understand
they have a very particular fish there

20:44.910 --> 20:46.571
because of the deep water.

20:47.496 --> 20:50.204
I'm not much of an angler, I'm afraid.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.667
<i>The Farquhar Thompsons.</i>

20:54.754 --> 20:56.586
Aren't they in town
at this time of year?

20:57.923 --> 21:01.882
- I believe Cressida's getting married.
- Will you be going?

21:02.011 --> 21:04.673
- Perhaps when things quieten down...
- Why don't you stay with us?

21:06.432 --> 21:09.595
We'd very much like you with us,
wouldn't we, Peter?

21:09.685 --> 21:12.552
It would give you a chance
to get to know Freddie.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.392
Of course.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.849
London's dreadfully expensive.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.190
You could have our room,
just until you're settled.

21:22.448 --> 21:25.440
- We shall muddle along perfectly well.
- I don't wish to muddle.

21:40.049 --> 21:43.258
A parishioner of mine
is struggling greatly.

21:44.386 --> 21:46.423
I'm afraid I need to sit with him
to try and help.

21:47.097 --> 21:49.054
After the dance?

21:49.099 --> 21:50.931
It's a little bit more important
than dancing.

21:51.477 --> 21:53.218
It's a personal crisis.

21:53.604 --> 21:54.765
We could reconvene.

21:55.231 --> 21:56.721
Tomorrow?

21:56.774 --> 22:00.233
- Dinner, perhaps?
- The dance is tonight, not tomorrow.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.559
Goodnight, Tom.

22:07.284 --> 22:09.901
These heels are murder, anyway.

22:19.421 --> 22:21.958
- Idiot.
- You all right, Reverend?

22:27.638 --> 22:31.006
You had every right
to ask about the mother.

22:31.100 --> 22:33.762
The day we stop asking
is the day we stop caring.

22:33.936 --> 22:37.930
Perhaps Mrs Saint feels more comfortable
with a younger midwife?

22:37.982 --> 22:42.317
I suppose I could seem like
a bit of a relic to these young mothers.

22:42.444 --> 22:45.436
We are that great sprawl!

22:45.489 --> 22:47.981
That growing mass of alchemy.

22:48.117 --> 22:50.779
Some of us are golden,
some of us are base.

22:51.787 --> 22:53.653
But you are golden.

22:53.789 --> 22:56.281
And although they do not know it,

22:56.333 --> 22:58.665
the young need you now more than ever.

23:00.963 --> 23:03.625
More or less the words
I was searching for.

23:06.802 --> 23:07.837
You promise?

23:07.970 --> 23:10.962
'Cause she brings the germs in with her,
the bad things.

23:11.056 --> 23:13.639
She ain't coming, don't take on so.

23:15.853 --> 23:18.345
- Pam?
- It's the germs.

23:19.481 --> 23:21.813
The air's full of 'em.
They're on you, they're all over you.

23:22.651 --> 23:23.641
Well, I want to hold her.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.397
Yeah, but I told you,
I got to keep her safe.

23:25.487 --> 23:28.149
I told you what the Sister's doing,
she's trying to hurt her.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.531
No, no.

23:30.659 --> 23:32.650
This has got to stop.

23:32.703 --> 23:35.866
You ain't making no sense, Pam.

23:35.998 --> 23:37.909
You promise she won't come?

23:38.000 --> 23:39.866
I told you, didn't I?

24:06.528 --> 24:08.519
The window tends to rattle a little

24:08.614 --> 24:11.948
but we find a wedge of paper
seems to do the trick.

24:12.034 --> 24:14.696
We're usually up early
but we'll try not to disturb you.

24:15.871 --> 24:17.532
You always were a stomper.

24:21.961 --> 24:25.454
- I must get on, Camilla.
- Likewise. Freddie to nursery,

24:25.714 --> 24:27.546
then the babies of Poplar,

24:27.591 --> 24:29.582
who won't delay
their entrance to the world,

24:29.718 --> 24:30.753
not even for you, Mater.

24:30.886 --> 24:33.253
Can one get The <i>Times</i> here?

24:33.389 --> 24:35.221
Well, it's usually a day late,

24:35.307 --> 24:39.551
taking into account the, uh,
time difference with central London.

24:49.446 --> 24:51.904
Midwives.

24:51.991 --> 24:54.232
Oh, why do they keep coming?

24:54.284 --> 24:56.742
Why won't they just leave us alone?

24:56.787 --> 24:58.653
- Mrs Saint?
- You.

24:58.747 --> 24:59.828
You ain't supposed to come here.

24:59.915 --> 25:01.280
Mrs Saint, whatever are you doing?

25:01.417 --> 25:04.409
Well, I have to clean her.
I have to sterilise everything.

25:04.461 --> 25:06.327
Can't trust the tap.
They put dangers in it.

25:06.422 --> 25:07.457
You're safer with the river.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.081
- Not with that.
- The water's far too hot.

25:10.175 --> 25:12.166
- You'll burn her.
- Yeah, well, I have to clean her.

25:12.261 --> 25:15.253
I'm going to put some cool in it.
I'll bring it right back.

25:16.807 --> 25:19.265
Stay with her, Nurse Miller.
I'm calling Dr Turner.

25:22.354 --> 25:25.096
Let's get Rose settled.

25:29.028 --> 25:30.860
I wanted to apologise, Fred.

25:31.196 --> 25:33.187
I must have seemed rude last night.

25:34.783 --> 25:38.822
From what I hear,
it's not me you need to apologise to.

25:38.954 --> 25:42.288
Still, needs must,
when parishioners fall upon hard times.

25:43.709 --> 25:48.454
There is no parishioner.
I have two left feet.

25:48.547 --> 25:51.289
I can't dance.

25:51.633 --> 25:54.375
I thought you lot
weren't supposed to lie?

25:55.179 --> 25:58.137
Trixie can have the pick of any man
she wants.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.302
I'm a book man.

26:01.060 --> 26:04.473
A pint man with a...
a jumper and a weekend jacket.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.184
I'm not a dancer.

26:10.861 --> 26:12.727
Meet me at the community centre,
6:00 sharp.

26:19.912 --> 26:21.823
Pupil Midwife Wells is with me today.

26:21.914 --> 26:24.326
She's here to complete her training.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.828
You need to palpate the abdomen
to check the baby's lie,

26:26.877 --> 26:28.242
presentation and position.

26:28.337 --> 26:30.169
No!

26:30.214 --> 26:33.673
I shan't be seen
except by a proper midwife.

26:33.759 --> 26:35.591
I came in here for the best of care.

26:35.677 --> 26:38.169
Pupil midwives need to learn
and I'm here to supervise.

26:38.263 --> 26:40.880
I want a trained professional.

26:41.016 --> 26:42.506
It's the very least I expect.

26:44.686 --> 26:46.347
Excuse us for a moment.

26:56.198 --> 26:59.441
I know what it is to lose
something precious, Mrs Rawle.

27:01.370 --> 27:04.863
And whether you believe it or not,
you are in the best hands.

27:08.043 --> 27:10.034
I did everything right.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.370
Before.

27:13.715 --> 27:17.379
I ate right, slept right,

27:18.303 --> 27:20.590
didn't even do no lifting at the end.

27:23.892 --> 27:26.224
They said I didn't call the midwife
soon enough

27:26.311 --> 27:28.097
and that's why she was stillborn.

27:29.439 --> 27:32.056
Sometimes these awful things
just happen.

27:32.401 --> 27:34.893
But what if it happens again?

27:34.945 --> 27:36.310
I came in here to be safe.

27:36.405 --> 27:40.148
That's why I keep asking for checks
but no one will listen.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.119
Let's see what baby's up to, shall we?

27:52.754 --> 27:54.085
A kick.

27:55.507 --> 27:57.839
Telling you to trust us.

27:59.595 --> 28:02.428
She's fallen in with my mother.

28:02.472 --> 28:04.088
They've been talking.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.924
She doesn't want me and Rose happy.

28:06.768 --> 28:08.008
She brought the germs in with her.

28:08.103 --> 28:11.937
It was a special one,
left over from when we had the Plague.

28:12.357 --> 28:15.941
Mrs Saint, who are you talking about?

28:17.279 --> 28:18.861
The Sister.

28:18.947 --> 28:20.779
The one who brought the badness in.

28:21.950 --> 28:23.031
Sister Julienne?

28:23.118 --> 28:24.700
Yeah, that's why
I have to get my baby clean.

28:24.786 --> 28:27.778
I have to take her to the river,
she'll be safe there, like Mo...

28:27.873 --> 28:29.284
Like Moses.

28:30.459 --> 28:31.949
You have to get her out of here, Nurse.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.160
You have to...
You have to keep her away from here.

28:34.296 --> 28:35.502
Please.

28:35.881 --> 28:37.792
Who's that?

28:37.841 --> 28:41.209
- Who have you brought here?
- It's Dr Turner.

28:41.303 --> 28:43.214
He visits all newly delivered mothers.

28:43.305 --> 28:46.013
Mrs Saint, it's quite all right.

28:46.516 --> 28:47.802
Hello, Mrs Saint.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.642
Would you wait next door, Nurse Miller?

28:57.527 --> 29:00.394
There's no need to worry.
No need at all.

29:14.670 --> 29:17.037
I've given her a sedative.

29:17.172 --> 29:20.881
She's stable but I would like
a second opinion, urgently.

29:21.510 --> 29:23.547
Could it be a puerperal psychosis?

29:24.012 --> 29:25.844
As a worst case, yes.

29:30.560 --> 29:32.551
I thought we spoke, Nurse.

29:32.688 --> 29:36.852
Mr Saint,
this is rather more than anxiety.

29:37.734 --> 29:40.271
Your wife is showing signs of paranoia.

29:41.029 --> 29:42.190
It's rare

29:42.239 --> 29:47.530
but it may be a hormonal fluctuation
caused by Rose's birth.

29:47.577 --> 29:51.696
Have you noticed any change
in her behaviour, anything at all?

29:52.416 --> 29:54.032
We must know, Mr Saint.

29:55.585 --> 29:57.952
There's no shame in it.

29:58.046 --> 30:01.539
She's my Pam.
There's nothing wrong with her.

30:01.591 --> 30:04.128
I'm arranging a psychiatric assessment.

30:04.219 --> 30:05.550
A head doctor?

30:05.595 --> 30:07.927
No, no, no, no,
she ain't going to no head doctor!

30:08.056 --> 30:10.423
Then he will visit her, today.

30:11.268 --> 30:14.056
And if she shows
any further signs of anxiety,

30:14.146 --> 30:15.636
you must telephone us.

30:16.773 --> 30:18.263
I'll call again later.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.651
Thank you. Goodbye.

30:25.240 --> 30:29.154
Dr Hatton will make a late call
to Mrs Saint tonight.

30:29.244 --> 30:30.655
Poor woman.

30:31.580 --> 30:33.821
We have our own appointment.

30:34.249 --> 30:37.082
We're to be interviewed
by the adoption society.

30:38.086 --> 30:41.624
They'll visit us at home
to see if we're fit and proper persons.

30:42.257 --> 30:44.749
I'd hope our work was testament to that.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.083
I think they're rather more concerned

30:46.178 --> 30:49.091
with the sort of people
we are outside of work

30:49.181 --> 30:51.092
and the home we may offer a child.

30:51.808 --> 30:53.970
Best behaviour, please.

30:57.314 --> 30:59.305
- Fred?
- Cue the music!

30:59.441 --> 31:00.681
Lights!

31:02.152 --> 31:04.610
Fred and Ginger at your service.

31:25.300 --> 31:26.631
Right.

31:27.969 --> 31:31.303
Left foot forward,
right foot to the side,

31:31.348 --> 31:32.884
bring the left foot to the right.

31:34.142 --> 31:35.724
- Ooh!
- Sorry.

31:35.811 --> 31:37.017
It's all in the eyes.

31:37.145 --> 31:39.637
Connect there and it doesn't matter
what your feet do.

31:44.319 --> 31:47.232
The waltz is all about protection.

31:48.323 --> 31:50.030
It's a dance that says,

31:51.493 --> 31:53.860
"I have you in my arms, my dear."

31:55.038 --> 31:56.824
- Ooh.
- "All is well with the world."

31:59.084 --> 32:03.499
It's also about trying
not to tread on the lady's toes.

32:04.214 --> 32:06.751
- You ain't making no sense. Enough.
- Don't let him back in here, okay?

32:06.842 --> 32:09.004
'Cause he tried to give me something
but I didn't take it.

32:09.052 --> 32:10.087
I spat it back out.

32:10.178 --> 32:12.089
He's a doctor, he's trying to help you.

32:12.180 --> 32:14.012
No, you... You need to help me!

32:14.057 --> 32:16.048
I don't want any more people
coming in here.

32:16.184 --> 32:18.676
- They're checking you and the baby.
- They want to take her!

32:18.728 --> 32:19.763
Stop this.

32:20.272 --> 32:22.183
Please. Stop it!

32:25.694 --> 32:27.935
You'll be all right.

32:28.029 --> 32:30.361
I'll get you some fish and chips, eh?

32:32.075 --> 32:33.565
You're all right.

32:57.893 --> 33:00.260
I'm afraid
they're just early labour pains.

33:00.395 --> 33:03.387
Not quite ready
for curtain up yet, Faye.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.056
Don't I get my flowers back?

33:06.067 --> 33:07.398
In the morning.

33:07.444 --> 33:09.230
They take oxygen from the ward at night.

33:09.779 --> 33:12.146
They reminded me of home.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.072
Makes me feel more alone than ever.

33:15.911 --> 33:17.572
You're not alone. You've got me.

33:18.580 --> 33:21.322
Will you be with me when my time comes?

33:23.752 --> 33:25.959
- Please, Nurse.
- Of course I will.

33:27.339 --> 33:28.750
Nurse Lee?

33:34.471 --> 33:37.088
Your job is to prepare
these women for labour,

33:37.140 --> 33:39.256
not to offer personal guarantees.

33:39.935 --> 33:42.597
It makes a great difference
to the patient if she feels supported.

33:42.687 --> 33:46.271
I won't insult you by pointing out
you are governed by shifts.

33:46.316 --> 33:49.149
- In an hour's time, yours is at an end.
- I'd be happy to work beyond...

33:49.277 --> 33:52.941
You're not here to involve yourself
in the lives of others.

33:53.031 --> 33:56.774
Isn't that why you've come away
from district midwifery?

34:07.379 --> 34:09.791
Bridge, was it?

34:09.880 --> 34:12.998
Yes. The old clears do love it.

34:14.135 --> 34:16.627
And you accompany it
with romantic music?

34:19.306 --> 34:21.344
I didn't come down in the last shower.

34:21.476 --> 34:22.966
I saw you. With Tom.

34:25.313 --> 34:27.179
It's not what you think.

34:27.315 --> 34:29.522
Or at least,
what I think you might think.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.018
Don't make a fool of me.

34:32.320 --> 34:35.312
I'm rather hurt you think I would.

34:35.364 --> 34:38.027
Rats! Look...

34:38.909 --> 34:42.197
I was teaching Tom to dance. For you.

34:43.540 --> 34:45.496
He wanted to surprise you.

34:45.542 --> 34:47.078
And just to add to the heady romance,

34:47.335 --> 34:52.000
Fred was there, utterly irresistible
to both Tom and myself.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.831
And with the greatest respect,
Tom is not my type.

34:55.510 --> 34:57.000
At all.

34:57.053 --> 34:59.010
And what do you mean by that?

34:59.097 --> 35:02.840
Well, apart from the fact
that he's clearly besotted with you,

35:02.934 --> 35:04.845
there are certain things he lacks

35:04.894 --> 35:09.013
and certain things he has too much of.

35:09.190 --> 35:10.430
For me.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.350
Pamela?

35:14.529 --> 35:15.860
I'm back!

35:29.919 --> 35:30.954
No!

35:35.467 --> 35:37.049
- Goodnight, Sister.
- Goodnight.

35:37.761 --> 35:39.547
Nurse Lee, help me.

35:40.221 --> 35:41.632
I think my waters have broken.

35:41.723 --> 35:43.555
Why on earth didn't you call me?

35:43.600 --> 35:44.761
Lie flat for me, Faye.

35:45.268 --> 35:46.804
I want Nurse Lee.

35:46.895 --> 35:48.135
She said she'd be with me.

35:48.229 --> 35:50.311
We're all here to help you, Mrs Rawle.

35:51.066 --> 35:54.730
She was fixated with the river.
About how the water there was safer.

35:54.986 --> 35:57.774
Is there somewhere she goes?
Somewhere with meaning?

35:57.906 --> 36:01.319
- There was, uh, the pier at Middle Dock.
- Right.

36:01.409 --> 36:04.447
Tell Dr Turner where we are.
You stay here in case she returns.

36:07.082 --> 36:09.289
Sister, the cord has prolapsed.

36:10.669 --> 36:11.750
What does that mean?

36:15.090 --> 36:17.627
We need to get you to theatre.
Baby's in difficulty.

36:18.093 --> 36:20.425
Call the porters.
Inform theatre we have a cord prolapse.

36:20.470 --> 36:21.926
Don't leave me, Nurse.
Please don't leave me.

36:22.013 --> 36:23.094
Baby's pushing on the cord.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.967
It's all right, Faye.
We need to relieve the pressure.

36:25.100 --> 36:26.636
Now, I need you on your knees.

36:27.519 --> 36:29.305
Good girl.

36:29.437 --> 36:32.270
Knees on the bed. Good.
And onto your elbows.

36:32.357 --> 36:34.940
- Lean on your elbows.
- I can't lose another.

36:35.276 --> 36:37.017
- You're not going to.
- Quickly now!

36:39.114 --> 36:40.525
Straight to theatre.

36:41.783 --> 36:43.148
Don't leave me, Nurse.

36:43.284 --> 36:45.275
Nurse Lee, your shift is at an end.

36:55.630 --> 36:57.541
Dear God. Pamela!

36:57.632 --> 36:59.623
- Oh, my Lord!
- What are you doing up there?

36:59.676 --> 37:02.213
My milk. It came.

37:02.303 --> 37:04.715
- Get down from there.
- You stay away!

37:04.806 --> 37:06.547
You just stay away from us!

37:07.350 --> 37:09.011
Stop it, Rose.

37:09.894 --> 37:12.135
I've got to get you clean.
I've got to get you safe.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.812
- Pam, I'm warning you!
- No.

37:13.857 --> 37:15.143
She's got my daughter.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.974
We must take very great care
because of that.

37:17.068 --> 37:21.403
I keep asking you,
why won't you just leave us?

37:22.198 --> 37:25.657
It's the germs.
Brought them here like wolves.

37:28.496 --> 37:29.986
You're frightening Rose.

37:30.039 --> 37:32.531
It's not me, it's you and it's that...

37:32.667 --> 37:36.001
It's that thing.
It scares her. It's that.

37:37.005 --> 37:39.747
My wimple? I'll take it off.

37:41.009 --> 37:44.172
I don't want to scare her.
Neither do you.

37:44.763 --> 37:46.879
You're her mother.

37:47.015 --> 37:48.346
You're the one that protects her.

37:48.558 --> 37:50.265
You're trying to trick me.

37:53.354 --> 37:55.186
- Oh, they're here to help.
- No, they...

37:55.273 --> 37:58.015
- They want to take her.
- They want you to be safe.

37:58.067 --> 38:00.104
- They want Rose to be safe.
- She's...

38:00.195 --> 38:01.356
She's crying, you see.

38:01.404 --> 38:03.065
She's crying
'cause she doesn't trust you.

38:03.198 --> 38:05.781
That's because she's cold.
Oh, look at her, Pamela.

38:06.576 --> 38:08.943
She's not strong enough to be out.

38:13.541 --> 38:17.205
Nurse Miller and I can help.
Let us help Rose.

38:25.762 --> 38:28.880
I can't. I have to wash her.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.264
- It's the germs.
- Not the river.

38:32.060 --> 38:33.721
In a warm bath.

38:34.229 --> 38:36.470
We can do that. We can take her home.

38:36.564 --> 38:39.056
Would you like that?
To go home? To be safe?

38:39.818 --> 38:41.809
For Rose to be safe?

39:08.680 --> 39:10.170
Quickly, Nurse Miller.

39:10.682 --> 39:12.298
Against your skin for warmth.

39:19.983 --> 39:23.146
- Sister!
- No, Pamela! No!

39:29.826 --> 39:33.945
You will get better.
You will get better.

39:35.206 --> 39:36.662
It will end.

39:37.458 --> 39:38.823
I promise.

39:40.003 --> 39:42.995
Fetch an ambulance.

39:55.476 --> 39:58.343
She is suffering
from puerperal psychosis.

39:59.480 --> 40:01.562
She is being admitted to Bow House.

40:02.901 --> 40:05.142
What, the nuthouse?

40:06.654 --> 40:09.021
She was happy, she...
She wanted the baby.

40:09.157 --> 40:11.694
She still does. She will be better.

40:11.826 --> 40:14.739
She tried to hurt our baby.

40:14.829 --> 40:16.490
How can a mother do that?

40:17.874 --> 40:20.161
I'd like to show you
how to give Rose her formula.

40:21.836 --> 40:23.827
Here. Yeah?

41:25.775 --> 41:27.891
I wouldn't ever hurt her.

41:31.155 --> 41:33.066
I just want her back.

41:39.163 --> 41:41.245
You don't strike me as a dancer.

41:42.917 --> 41:46.126
Well, that's because you haven't been
swept round the dance floor by me.

41:46.921 --> 41:48.662
I won competitions.

41:49.632 --> 41:50.997
Me and my old lady.

41:53.845 --> 41:56.587
I miss it, the dancing.

41:57.598 --> 41:59.509
Well, her most of all.

42:00.810 --> 42:02.346
It was nice to hear the music again.

42:04.105 --> 42:07.143
It's very unfair
to pluck at my heartstrings.

42:08.818 --> 42:12.777
This business about the parishioner...
He made it up.

42:14.449 --> 42:17.783
He was too embarrassed to tell you
he can't dance.

42:19.328 --> 42:21.365
He's mad about you, Nurse Franklin.

42:22.623 --> 42:24.205
He's got potential.

42:24.292 --> 42:26.033
Hidden

42:26.127 --> 42:27.709
but it's definitely there.

42:52.070 --> 42:53.310
I lost it, didn't I?

42:56.157 --> 42:58.364
You have a little boy, Faye.

42:59.410 --> 43:01.993
Who screams his lungs out,
has 10 fingers

43:02.038 --> 43:03.870
and 10 perfect toes.

43:04.707 --> 43:06.243
I can't believe they didn't tell you.

43:06.334 --> 43:08.325
Where is he? I... I want to see him.

43:08.377 --> 43:11.335
You've had major surgery.
You need time to recover.

43:11.756 --> 43:12.996
Please.

43:14.050 --> 43:15.415
I never held my last.

43:17.345 --> 43:20.007
I wish there was something I could do.

43:20.098 --> 43:22.715
It's against hospital rules.

43:27.605 --> 43:31.064
I'm not even supposed
to be in here.

43:32.902 --> 43:35.690
We've enough here
to feed the whole of Poplar.

43:35.780 --> 43:37.236
Might we keep a little back?

43:37.365 --> 43:39.447
I don't think Mr Saint knows
how to operate anything

43:39.534 --> 43:41.445
beyond a tin opener in the kitchen.

43:41.536 --> 43:42.867
I could take it to him.

43:42.954 --> 43:44.786
I'd rather it went to his wife.

43:44.872 --> 43:46.362
She's the one that's suffering.

43:46.415 --> 43:48.907
Nurse Franklin,
they are all suffering.

43:49.293 --> 43:52.911
Thankfully, baby's with an aunt
and will have no memory of events.

43:53.047 --> 43:54.583
How long for, though?

43:54.715 --> 43:56.752
The Largactil's cured the psychosis

43:57.051 --> 43:59.383
but can do nothing
for her terrible depression.

43:59.428 --> 44:03.046
We must hope the electro-convulsive
therapy restores her.

44:03.432 --> 44:05.719
I worked in a psychiatric ward.

44:05.810 --> 44:09.098
I've never seen a patient
get free of the black dog without it.

44:10.439 --> 44:12.897
Timothy is a very happy young child

44:12.984 --> 44:16.477
who, we hope, reflects the love
our home is filled with.

44:18.447 --> 44:21.405
Our wards have already
been abandoned once.

44:21.951 --> 44:24.238
It is my duty
to limit their pain to once.

44:24.328 --> 44:26.740
We would never abandon a child.

44:26.789 --> 44:28.575
What occupied you during the period

44:28.666 --> 44:33.331
April 1945 to December of that year,
Dr Turner?

44:34.255 --> 44:39.091
Your detailed service and work history.
There seems to be an omission.

44:39.760 --> 44:41.626
I was injured.

44:41.762 --> 44:43.469
Could you be more specific?

44:43.598 --> 44:45.680
- I'd prefer not to.
- Patrick!

44:46.434 --> 44:48.141
I don't see how this is relevant.

44:49.020 --> 44:51.182
You were discharged from the army.

44:51.272 --> 44:53.764
You must understand.

44:53.858 --> 44:55.599
It was the end of the war.

44:57.361 --> 45:01.776
I was medical corps.
Trying to save lives at the front...

45:01.866 --> 45:06.611
You were an inpatient at
Northfield Military Psychiatric Hospital

45:06.662 --> 45:07.993
for five months,

45:09.123 --> 45:11.785
while you were being treated
for war neurosis.

45:16.797 --> 45:19.334
I was worn out.

45:19.467 --> 45:22.129
There was too much death.

45:24.388 --> 45:27.847
I recovered. I am recovered.

45:33.898 --> 45:36.981
We've both needed great strength.

45:39.320 --> 45:41.482
We believe a child
should be placed in a home

45:41.572 --> 45:45.987
where truth and trust
are central to that home.

45:48.537 --> 45:50.653
How could you not tell me?

45:50.748 --> 45:53.206
I didn't think she would go
through my entire history.

45:53.501 --> 45:55.492
She is placing a child.

45:55.878 --> 45:58.210
She needs to know
who she is placing it with,

45:58.339 --> 45:59.579
so do I.

46:01.717 --> 46:03.583
What happened to you?

46:05.513 --> 46:08.346
I can't talk about it.

46:08.432 --> 46:12.016
If you think we can forget this,
you don't know me.

46:12.520 --> 46:15.512
I won't live
with this between us, Patrick.

46:15.564 --> 46:17.350
I manage!

46:17.858 --> 46:21.351
I manage by keeping it behind me.

46:21.445 --> 46:22.685
How can you treat others

46:22.780 --> 46:26.694
when you so clearly
cannot treat yourself?

46:33.541 --> 46:35.373
Mr Saint?

46:37.586 --> 46:39.577
Might you visit Pamela?

46:40.381 --> 46:42.418
- What, in the nuthouse?
- It's not an asylum.

46:42.550 --> 46:44.382
Keep your voice down, please.

46:45.469 --> 46:47.881
You saying the people in there
ain't loonies?

46:47.930 --> 46:50.297
The people in there
are being treated for mental illnesses

46:50.391 --> 46:52.928
by medical doctors and nurses,
not jailors.

46:53.394 --> 46:56.978
- It ain't no place for decent people.
- They're ill, Mr Saint.

46:57.064 --> 46:59.601
They should be extended
the same understanding

46:59.734 --> 47:01.441
that we have for physical illnesses.

47:01.569 --> 47:03.936
Your visit will speed her recovery.

47:04.739 --> 47:08.573
You didn't lose your daughter,
you must not lose your wife.

47:34.185 --> 47:35.516
Hello, little one.

47:36.479 --> 47:38.436
There's someone you need to meet.

47:43.444 --> 47:46.152
- Can I help you, Nurse?
- Yes.

47:48.199 --> 47:51.112
I need a very, very large favour.

48:01.295 --> 48:03.127
You have to be very careful.

48:03.172 --> 48:04.458
Gentle movements.

48:05.216 --> 48:06.502
Is he really mine?

48:08.135 --> 48:09.500
Every last ounce.

48:11.305 --> 48:12.545
Gently.

48:21.482 --> 48:23.189
Beautiful.

48:43.170 --> 48:45.332
I understand
you had to dance with Patsy,

48:46.048 --> 48:50.337
which, charming as she is,
took a great deal of courage.

48:51.345 --> 48:52.756
I want to make you happy.

48:56.434 --> 48:59.017
It'd be a crime to waste
what you've learned.

49:01.021 --> 49:02.853
I'm off at 5:00.

49:23.377 --> 49:24.708
It's no use.

49:28.215 --> 49:30.877
I can stand up in a school or a church

49:30.968 --> 49:34.086
and give a sermon to
a hundred people but...

49:36.724 --> 49:38.715
When it's just me, I...

49:41.312 --> 49:43.724
I want to be able to sweep you
off your feet

49:44.482 --> 49:46.940
- but I can't even...
- Do be quiet.

49:48.777 --> 49:53.066
There are some things
you just have to stop thinking about

49:55.409 --> 49:57.070
and start doing.

50:29.527 --> 50:30.938
Sign here.

51:23.497 --> 51:27.741
Quite why curd should be
such a challenge.

51:28.669 --> 51:29.875
Let me.

51:35.676 --> 51:40.546
Should you tire of nursing, Nurse Lee,
I may have want of a jar opener.

51:41.390 --> 51:43.176
I may enjoy it.

51:43.684 --> 51:46.426
At least I'd be able to see it through
from beginning to end.

51:46.520 --> 51:50.354
Not tasting, of course.
I retain all tasting rights.

51:52.359 --> 51:55.568
How did care become so lightly valued?

51:56.030 --> 51:58.362
In the hospital, I mean.

51:58.449 --> 52:02.033
It seems I'd do better
if I treat my patients like strangers.

52:04.038 --> 52:07.702
Swift machines built for the future,

52:07.791 --> 52:09.953
the world passes in a blur.

52:11.462 --> 52:14.420
But we can always walk, Nurse Lee,

52:15.716 --> 52:18.083
should we prefer to see
what we are missing.

52:18.886 --> 52:21.719
I have the cream.

52:27.561 --> 52:29.552
Lady Browne.

52:39.406 --> 52:41.238
You all right?

52:41.283 --> 52:42.899
You look a little pale.

52:45.454 --> 52:49.618
The air could hardly be described
as therapeutic.

52:52.753 --> 52:55.586
What school have you got
Freddie down for?

52:56.757 --> 52:58.247
I'm sorry?

52:58.300 --> 53:00.758
One cannot get the ball rolling
too soon.

53:02.930 --> 53:04.295
Oh, I see.

53:07.142 --> 53:08.849
I think you understand
that we're not in a position

53:08.936 --> 53:11.769
to manage a private education
for Freddie

53:11.814 --> 53:14.772
but we have high hopes
for the grammar school.

53:19.154 --> 53:20.861
I can almost accept the limitations

53:20.948 --> 53:23.280
my daughter has set herself
through this marriage

53:24.535 --> 53:28.199
but my grandson,
to be so poorly provided for...

53:28.288 --> 53:32.327
- I love them.
- One cannot survive on love.

53:32.459 --> 53:34.951
- One cannot survive without it.
- Camilla.

53:35.003 --> 53:36.664
It needs to be said.

53:37.673 --> 53:39.334
We could scrimp and save.

53:40.300 --> 53:42.166
We could possibly afford the fees,

53:42.636 --> 53:44.877
- send him away...
- Camilla, let's talk about this later.

53:45.389 --> 53:49.053
We could have him reared
by cold and distant people

53:49.810 --> 53:51.471
who would want him
to be cold and distant,

53:51.562 --> 53:54.304
so he didn't cry himself to sleep.

53:54.356 --> 53:56.723
But despite
what you so clearly think of us,

53:59.236 --> 54:02.149
we believe
we'll give him the best start.

54:04.241 --> 54:06.482
Because he'll know he's loved.

54:20.007 --> 54:22.339
I fear you were right all along,
Mater.

54:22.760 --> 54:26.003
You're better off in a hotel.

54:26.096 --> 54:27.552
Excuse me.

54:48.911 --> 54:50.367
Ah, Nurse Lee.

54:50.412 --> 54:51.777
Mrs Morecombe into delivery.

54:51.872 --> 54:54.204
- Update her notes, please.
- Of course.

54:54.249 --> 54:56.081
Sister?

54:58.295 --> 55:01.208
I'm afraid I have to give notice
on my time here.

55:01.965 --> 55:03.751
I'm sorry.

55:03.884 --> 55:06.046
I admire what you do greatly,

55:06.094 --> 55:08.756
but I realise

55:08.889 --> 55:12.757
I have to be able to sit with a patient
all night if needed

55:12.893 --> 55:15.055
or go to her at a moment's notice.

55:16.980 --> 55:21.440
I need to care, I can't ration it
or turn it into an efficiency.

55:22.778 --> 55:24.564
That'll never be my way.

55:38.919 --> 55:40.956
Goodbye, little one.

55:41.088 --> 55:44.581
Grandma's made a bit
of a hash of things, hasn't she?

55:45.133 --> 55:46.589
See?

55:48.095 --> 55:49.677
You're a natural with him.

55:51.932 --> 55:53.639
I'm a natural with horses.

55:54.309 --> 55:57.097
Both parties know where they stand.

55:58.939 --> 56:04.184
Lady Browne, why don't we all sit down,
see if we can't work this out?

56:26.717 --> 56:28.799
Nonnatus House, midwife speaking.

56:29.970 --> 56:31.176
Peter.

56:37.853 --> 56:41.141
<i>Pamela continued
with a course of treatment</i>

56:41.189 --> 56:45.148
<i>as unfathomable as the brain
on which it was applied.</i>

56:48.989 --> 56:52.983
<i>Like a filament powered
by the same electricity,</i>

56:53.076 --> 56:57.491
<i>she began to grow brighter,
began to return.</i>

56:58.916 --> 57:03.535
<i>But still,
she was separated from her child.</i>

57:08.008 --> 57:09.419
And it was just us,

57:09.843 --> 57:13.052
dancing to the sound of the river
and Ella Fitzgerald.

57:13.180 --> 57:14.887
How romantic!

57:15.849 --> 57:18.090
Though, of course, I shall need
cotton wool for my shoes.

57:18.185 --> 57:19.516
Protect the toes.

57:19.561 --> 57:22.019
Don't remind me,
I still have the bruises.

57:24.524 --> 57:27.562
Is it true? You're back properly?

57:30.864 --> 57:32.696
I miss the East End.

57:32.783 --> 57:34.524
Just the East End?

57:36.536 --> 57:40.370
Cycling over the cobbles,
very good for the legs.

57:40.958 --> 57:43.040
The endless cups of tea,

57:43.085 --> 57:45.702
heaving my bag around all day,
every day.

57:45.754 --> 57:48.246
- All those little things.
- And us?

57:50.133 --> 57:51.623
Didn't I say?

57:51.718 --> 57:54.050
Missed you most of all.

58:34.845 --> 58:36.586
Have you spoken with the surgeons?

58:38.974 --> 58:41.591
They call it an open-and-closed case.

58:42.811 --> 58:45.303
Investigations show malignant tumours

58:45.439 --> 58:48.773
in the abdomen, liver, spleen...

58:48.942 --> 58:50.683
I could go on.

58:51.987 --> 58:53.944
"Nothing can be done."

58:55.490 --> 58:57.276
Such simple words.

58:59.161 --> 59:00.447
Oh, Camilla.

59:04.541 --> 59:07.784
To have been in such pain
and kept silent.

59:16.553 --> 59:19.386
You're making a wonderful job of that.

59:19.473 --> 59:20.838
Probably shouldn't.

59:21.475 --> 59:25.969
Feels like I'm getting ahead of myself
but I can't just sit here doing nothing.

59:27.147 --> 59:28.683
And even if I don't get
to give it to her myself,

59:28.815 --> 59:31.557
just knowing that she's warm...

59:33.153 --> 59:36.646
- I'm going to leave you now, Pamela.
- No, no, no, I want you to stay.

59:36.698 --> 59:39.235
I, um... I finished the hat.
I was going to show you.

59:39.910 --> 59:43.528
You have other visitors.

01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:15.358
Take her, then.

01:00:19.032 --> 01:00:20.363
She needs you.

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:23.362
We both do.

01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:43.716
<i>Invisible wounds are the hardest to heal,</i>

01:00:44.432 --> 01:00:47.595
<i>for their closure
depends upon the love of others,</i>

01:00:48.395 --> 01:00:51.228
<i>on patience, understanding</i>

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:54.056
<i>and the tender gift of time.</i>

01:01:02.742 --> 01:01:04.608
Begging your pardon, Sister,
but it's Sister Monica Joan.

01:01:04.744 --> 01:01:05.825
Oh, no.

01:01:09.249 --> 01:01:10.239
Are you the father?

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:11.414
- He's the cousin.
- Out.

01:01:11.459 --> 01:01:14.793
The mother-daughter bond
is a very precious thing.

01:01:21.303 --> 01:01:23.135
<i>Nurse Lee has some news for us.</i>
