00:01.747 --> 00:04.251
Jerry said you were worried
you might have done this.

00:04.251 --> 00:06.179
I experienced some kind
of a blackout.

00:06.179 --> 00:07.906
We need to change our plea.

00:07.906 --> 00:09.564
No, no, no, no, no, no!

00:09.599 --> 00:10.548
She's insane.

00:10.583 --> 00:13.040
What do you think Mrs Wilkes
loved most about you?

00:13.040 --> 00:14.310
I made her laugh.

00:14.345 --> 00:15.282
You made her laugh.

00:15.282 --> 00:15.877
I'm funny.

00:15.877 --> 00:17.550
Were you obsessed with Marcia Hooper?

00:17.550 --> 00:18.397
I adored her.

00:18.397 --> 00:20.199
Why'd she get a restraining order
against you?

00:20.199 --> 00:22.575
What do I have to do,
kill somebody?

00:22.826 --> 00:24.573
Oops. I didn't see you there.

00:24.573 --> 00:26.250
What are you doing, Lincoln?

00:26.250 --> 00:30.241
Tonight's date is with me
after all, Shirley Schmidt.

<i>The latest report is that
Ms Jane is conscious.</i>

00:42.632 --> 00:44.158
<i>She will survive.</i>

00:44.158 --> 00:46.656
<i>Police are not commenting on
whether she was able to provide</i>

00:46.656 --> 00:48.598
<i>any information on her assailant…</i>

00:48.598 --> 00:49.253
Denny…

00:49.254 --> 00:51.798
Can you believe it? Somebody
actually tried to take her out.

00:51.798 --> 00:53.017
Have you seen Shirley?

00:53.017 --> 00:54.297
Naked?

00:54.332 --> 00:55.542
Lately.

00:55.577 --> 00:58.263
She hasn't come in.
She's not answering her calls.

00:58.263 --> 01:00.804
She's, uh, just disappeared.

01:05.232 --> 01:09.705
♫ Christmas, Christmas time is near ♫

01:09.740 --> 01:11.851
♫ Time for toys ♫

01:11.886 --> 01:14.131
♫ And time for cheer ♫

01:14.166 --> 01:18.673
♫ We've been good but we can't last ♫

01:18.708 --> 01:23.730
♫ Hurry, Christmas, hurry fast ♫

01:29.004 --> 01:30.457
Would you like to scream?

01:30.457 --> 01:33.198
It's okay. The room is
completely soundproof.

01:33.198 --> 01:35.553
It's my little safe room.

01:35.588 --> 01:37.631
Listen, if I agreed not to press charges…

01:37.631 --> 01:40.100
Do you think I'm stupid?

01:40.765 --> 01:42.506
Certainly twisted.

01:42.541 --> 01:46.033
The police would press charges
regardless of your wishes,

01:46.033 --> 01:51.457
and besides, this is the room where
the only relevant wishes are mine.

01:53.241 --> 01:58.052
From the first moment I saw you,
do you know what I wanted to do?

01:58.403 --> 01:59.680
Pave my driveway?

01:59.715 --> 02:02.604
I wanted to suck on
your right earlobe.

02:02.639 --> 02:07.064
I'm sure people tell you
you have soft, supple lobes.

02:07.099 --> 02:09.015
It gets old.

02:09.365 --> 02:14.263
Is mocking me really an exercise of
your most sound judgment, Shirley?

02:14.298 --> 02:18.308
After all, I do have in my
possession a loaded firearm.

02:18.343 --> 02:19.823
Let alone a ukulele.

02:19.858 --> 02:21.987
I might do you harm, Shirley Schmidt.

02:21.987 --> 02:23.732
Do you not think I will?

02:23.767 --> 02:25.245
Lincoln,

02:25.280 --> 02:28.761
suck my lobe.

03:01.205 --> 03:03.960
I'm just saying,
as circumstantial cases go,

03:03.960 --> 03:05.195
it's a strong one.

03:05.230 --> 03:10.451
Erica, there's no evidence of
anybody else being there but you.

03:10.486 --> 03:11.728
What about her husband?

03:11.728 --> 03:14.063
He was there. The cameras
clearly show him.

03:14.063 --> 03:16.003
The video also shows him

03:16.038 --> 03:19.959
leaving the apartment building
four minutes after entering.

03:19.994 --> 03:21.675
Erica…

03:22.339 --> 03:26.592
it's not too late to amend our plea.

03:27.097 --> 03:28.956
You think I'm insane, don't you?

03:28.956 --> 03:30.781
Well, there's the 2-hour blackout…

03:30.781 --> 03:32.156
Caused by trauma.

03:32.191 --> 03:33.243
You hear voices.

03:33.243 --> 03:34.040
No, no, no!

03:34.041 --> 03:36.173
–You snap.
–Hey!

03:36.208 --> 03:38.306
Case in point.

03:40.957 --> 03:42.674
I see what you're doing.

03:42.709 --> 03:47.698
You're deliberately antagonizing me
to see how I'll respond on cross.

03:47.733 --> 03:49.912
Actually, that wasn't it.

03:49.947 --> 03:52.091
A little help, Jerry.

03:54.958 --> 03:58.384
Erica, we really need
to consider insanity.

03:58.419 --> 04:01.810
The evidence, we feel, excludes suicide.

04:01.845 --> 04:03.729
The only one there was you.

04:03.764 --> 04:06.829
We need to at least consider
a diminished capacity plea,

04:06.829 --> 04:12.067
if for no other reason than to give us
some plea-bargaining leverage.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.911
Let's hug for luck.

04:27.255 --> 04:29.965
I know you two will take care of me.

04:38.018 --> 04:40.124
–Any thoughts?
–None.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.505
Ready?

04:51.798 --> 04:53.040
I'm ready.

04:53.041 --> 04:55.528
I actually feel…

04:55.563 --> 04:57.469
calm.

04:57.504 --> 04:59.979
Of course, I'm medicated but…

05:01.124 --> 05:02.757
Look at me.

05:03.538 --> 05:07.394
This is a murder trial, Jerry,
a particularly difficult one at that.

05:07.394 --> 05:09.576
If at any time you feel…
–Why?

05:10.562 --> 05:11.453
Sorry?

05:11.488 --> 05:13.508
Why is it a particularly difficult one?

05:13.508 --> 05:17.476
Well, surely you've considered
our client may be guilty.

05:17.511 --> 05:20.002
I don't believe that.
She's innocent, Alan.

05:20.002 --> 05:22.303
I'm gonna win this trial.

05:34.707 --> 05:36.607
Everything all right, Denny?

05:36.642 --> 05:38.476
I'm depressed.

05:38.654 --> 05:39.959
Okay.

05:40.802 --> 05:41.636
Why?

05:41.671 --> 05:43.311
My murder case went away.

05:43.311 --> 05:45.561
You've still got yours.
It just doesn't seem fair.

05:45.561 --> 05:47.417
Nutty Lincoln didn't whack the judge?

05:47.417 --> 05:48.809
I need a case, Alan.

05:48.844 --> 05:50.166
You'll get a case.

05:50.201 --> 05:54.845
This country has the most homicides
of any western industrialized nation.

05:54.845 --> 05:55.748
Even so…

05:55.783 --> 05:57.753
16,000 a year, Denny.

05:57.788 --> 06:02.100
That's about five times the amount
of American soldiers killed in Iraq.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.235
Sooner or later,

06:03.270 --> 06:06.824
one of these slaughters is
gonna end up in your lap.

06:06.859 --> 06:08.253
Chin up!

06:11.590 --> 06:13.266
What do you mean that she's missing?

06:13.266 --> 06:15.776
Nobody's seen her since
the night before last.

06:15.776 --> 06:17.210
Did she cancel the dinner?

06:17.210 --> 06:18.575
No, she just didn't show up.

06:18.575 --> 06:20.255
Have we thought about calling her family?

06:20.255 --> 06:21.901
I think it's time we started doing that.

06:21.901 --> 06:23.604
Let's try not to alarm them.

06:23.604 --> 06:25.373
Are we really sure she's missing?

06:25.373 --> 06:28.324
Sometimes old people just slip off
to have some work done.

06:28.324 --> 06:31.690
It may be premature,
but I'm gonna call the police.

06:32.066 --> 06:34.415
–We feel this was a staged suicide.
–Why?

06:34.415 --> 06:36.256
Well, there were rope burns
on the victim's wrists

06:36.256 --> 06:37.665
indicating that she had been tied up.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.816
There was an aborted 911
call from the apartment.

06:39.816 --> 06:43.005
People don't generally call 911
before they hang themselves.

06:43.005 --> 06:44.160
Who made this call?

06:44.160 --> 06:46.309
Nobody spoke.
It was just a hang-up.

06:46.309 --> 06:48.593
We know the call came
from the victim's apartment.

06:48.593 --> 06:52.632
Detective, what leads you to believe
the defendant committed this crime?

06:52.632 --> 06:55.197
She claims she walked in
to discover the dead body.

06:55.197 --> 06:58.259
Well, if so, then why did she wait
two hours before calling anybody?

06:58.259 --> 06:59.236
What else?

06:59.271 --> 07:01.280
Her fingerprints were found
all over the place.

07:01.280 --> 07:03.254
The fibers of the rope used
to tie the victim up

07:03.254 --> 07:04.967
were found on the defendant's clothing.

07:04.967 --> 07:06.112
Would she have a motive?

07:06.112 --> 07:07.716
She and the victim were lovers.

07:07.716 --> 07:09.833
She had recently been dumped
for another woman.

07:09.833 --> 07:13.162
We accounted for every person
entering that apartment building.

07:13.162 --> 07:17.185
She's the only one who could have
conceivably committed this murder.

07:17.185 --> 07:18.431
Thank you, sir.

07:24.651 --> 07:26.057
Jerry…

07:26.760 --> 07:28.950
This would be your time.

07:48.286 --> 07:49.638
The surveillance cameras indicate

07:49.638 --> 07:51.914
the husband went to the victim's apartment
that morning, did they not?

07:51.914 --> 07:53.418
There's no way he could have gone in,

07:53.418 --> 07:54.888
rigged a noose and hung her that quickly.

07:54.888 --> 07:57.358
Your testimony is it's impossible?

07:57.393 --> 07:58.888
Extremely unlikely.

07:58.923 --> 08:00.525
You mentioned there were
no other fingerprints at the scene

08:00.525 --> 08:03.004
to suggest the husband
or anybody else being present.

08:03.004 --> 08:06.107
In your experience, have you
ever known killers to wear gloves?

08:06.107 --> 08:07.606
–Yes, but…
–Thank you.

08:07.641 --> 08:10.550
The building has a rear entrance,
which is not monitored by cameras.

08:10.550 --> 08:11.309
Am I correct?

08:11.309 --> 08:12.964
–Yes, a service entrance.
–Thank you.

08:12.964 --> 08:15.108
As far as the people who reside
in the apartment building,

08:15.108 --> 08:19.333
you have no way of monitoring
or accounting for their activity
in the complex, do you?

08:19.333 --> 08:20.990
–No, but we interviewed almost…
–Thank you.

08:20.990 --> 08:23.720
You mentioned motive.
Did you consider a financial motive?

08:23.720 --> 08:24.491
We did.

08:24.526 --> 08:27.363
Mrs Wilkes left an estate
valued at roughly $600,000.

08:27.363 --> 08:29.669
Who gets that money
upon her death, if you know?

08:29.669 --> 08:31.940
I'm informed it's her girlfriend,
Renée Winger.

08:31.940 --> 08:35.770
Ah, yes, the new girlfriend, that…

08:37.775 --> 08:39.727
that…

08:40.532 --> 08:44.171
that woman sitting right there.
She inherits.

08:44.206 --> 08:45.646
Can we be positive

08:45.681 --> 08:48.579
she did not go into the building
through the service entrance…

08:48.579 --> 08:49.956
If she had gone
into the apartment,

08:49.956 --> 08:51.182
your client would have been
there at the time.

08:51.182 --> 08:53.801
Unless Ms Winger went in before
my client returned from her hike.

08:53.801 --> 08:56.239
Then why would your client
wait two hours to call you, if…

08:56.239 --> 08:57.782
'Cause she suffered
a traumatic blackout

08:57.782 --> 08:59.291
which led her into
a catatonic stupor and…

08:59.291 --> 09:00.504
–Objection!
–Sustained.

09:00.504 --> 09:03.983
You connected fibers from the ropes
used to tie the victim's hands
to my client's clothes.

09:03.983 --> 09:07.688
Any fibers from the robe
used to hang the victim
traceable to my client?

09:07.688 --> 09:08.897
–No.
–Thank you.

09:08.932 --> 09:11.007
Going back to motive,
in addition to the will,

09:11.007 --> 09:14.180
is there a million-dollar life
insurance policy in play here?

09:14.180 --> 09:15.355
Yes, there is.

09:15.390 --> 09:17.818
–Who is the beneficiary there?
–The husband.

09:17.818 --> 09:20.212
So we have two people
with financial motive,

09:20.212 --> 09:22.143
neither being my client.

09:36.053 --> 09:41.419
<i>It takes more than a stiff whack
on the head to keep me down, folks.</i>

09:41.454 --> 09:44.516
<i>Trust me, I get hit harder
during sex.</i>

09:44.551 --> 09:49.902
<i>I'm only sorry this creepo didn't have
at me with a shovel during Sweeps.</i>

09:50.422 --> 09:53.493
I knew I should have
plunked her a second time.

09:53.493 --> 09:54.848
I just knew it.

09:54.883 --> 09:57.467
Are you telling me you're
the one who assaulted her?

09:57.467 --> 10:00.060
I say that in confidence, of course.

10:00.095 --> 10:05.190
Lincoln, why are you so determined
to have people believe you're dangerous?

10:05.225 --> 10:07.972
You're not dangerous, are you?

10:08.849 --> 10:11.620
You don't think I can be violent?

10:26.846 --> 10:28.768
What in God's name?

10:28.803 --> 10:30.859
This room is my little Waco.

10:30.894 --> 10:33.453
If somebody should try to
break in here to rescue you

10:33.453 --> 10:35.971
while this lock is set,

10:36.006 --> 10:39.671
it triggers the spring bow to go off.

10:39.706 --> 10:43.337
I bet now you're convinced I'm sinister.

10:44.967 --> 10:46.808
Lincoln…

10:46.843 --> 10:49.300
what are you doing?

11:01.231 --> 11:02.546
My apologies.

11:02.581 --> 11:04.478
Renée, you're looking well.

11:04.513 --> 11:06.340
I'm glad. It's a goal.

11:06.375 --> 11:10.161
Coping okay with your tragic loss?

11:10.196 --> 11:12.706
I see you've put me
on your witness list.

11:12.706 --> 11:14.239
It has me flummoxed.

11:14.274 --> 11:17.324
I just thought by that point in the trial,

11:17.359 --> 11:21.393
the jury could use a good laugh,
and you're funny!

11:21.657 --> 11:25.578
I certainly won't have anything
to say that could help her.

11:28.195 --> 11:29.651
You check local hospitals?

11:29.651 --> 11:31.585
All of them, and we've called family.

11:31.585 --> 11:33.485
And you're thinking she was abducted?

11:33.485 --> 11:34.990
I don't know what to think.

11:34.990 --> 11:37.086
I want the police to investigate.

11:37.086 --> 11:39.876
It's too soon to officially
declare her a missing person.

11:39.876 --> 11:42.631
It is not like this woman
to just fall off the earth.

11:42.631 --> 11:44.220
Russell, something has happened.

11:44.220 --> 11:46.112
Can I just throw one name out there?

11:46.112 --> 11:47.036
Lincoln Meyer.

11:47.058 --> 11:47.935
Well, who is that?

11:47.935 --> 11:49.789
You investigated him in
the murder of judge Potts.

11:49.789 --> 11:51.608
We considered him
a possible killer of Hooper.

11:51.608 --> 11:53.520
He has a grudge against this law firm,

11:53.520 --> 11:57.634
and he's always talking about his
“special relationship” with Shirley.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.023
Remember what the shrink said

11:59.023 --> 12:01.982
when we were exploring Lincoln
as Marcia Hooper's killer?

12:01.982 --> 12:04.943
When somebody becomes addicted
to being the object of entertainment,

12:04.943 --> 12:07.179
which clearly Lincoln is,

12:07.214 --> 12:09.648
they can develop pathological desires,

12:09.648 --> 12:12.238
and eventually, they act on them.

12:13.938 --> 12:16.000
You need to eat.

12:16.035 --> 12:18.199
I told you, I'm not hungry.

12:18.234 --> 12:20.328
Here comes the airplane!

12:20.363 --> 12:21.965
Yeah, right. Instead of the plane,

12:21.965 --> 12:24.148
why don't you reach into my purse
and get me my cell phone?

12:24.148 --> 12:27.454
Zooming in, getting closer, closer.

12:27.489 --> 12:29.578
Getting ready to land.

12:29.613 --> 12:31.668
One little bite for daddy.

12:39.970 --> 12:44.693
I'm not sure we can
be friends after that.

12:49.675 --> 12:53.041
When was the last time
you spoke to your wife, sir?

12:53.311 --> 12:55.281
The day before her death.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.689
Would you describe her as suicidal?

12:57.724 --> 12:59.278
Absolutely not.

12:59.313 --> 13:01.316
Paula would never
have taken her own life.

13:01.316 --> 13:02.809
She's a devout Catholic.

13:02.809 --> 13:06.569
Suicide went firmly against
her religious convictions.

13:06.604 --> 13:10.329
Wouldn't homosexuality go
against her Catholic beliefs?

13:10.364 --> 13:12.619
Well, yes.

13:12.654 --> 13:15.826
Your wife was being treated
for depression, was she not?

13:15.826 --> 13:17.703
–That is true, but I…
–Thank you.

13:17.703 --> 13:19.483
Did you know, Mr Wilkes,

13:19.518 --> 13:24.597
that Paula had recently superseded
her will to leave everything to that…

13:25.211 --> 13:26.833
Alan?

13:28.039 --> 13:29.662
That woman?

13:29.697 --> 13:30.819
I learned this, yes.

13:30.819 --> 13:34.543
Lucky there was a life insurance policy
naming you as sole beneficiary.

13:34.543 --> 13:37.028
If you are suggesting
that I could harm my wife…

13:37.028 --> 13:41.498
Your business recently filed
for chapter 11 bankruptcy.

13:43.624 --> 13:48.229
Your wife's death relieves you of
a dire financial situation, does it not?

13:48.229 --> 13:51.118
Please answer the question, sir.

13:54.599 --> 13:58.080
Whatever evil I may be
capable of, Mr Espenson,

13:58.115 --> 14:00.149
I could never harm
another human being,

14:00.149 --> 14:03.977
especially one I spent
the better part of 11 years loving.

14:04.036 --> 14:08.544
Your response implied that
you are indeed capable of evil.

14:08.579 --> 14:10.960
Could you list six examples, please?

14:20.855 --> 14:24.986
You have been truly,
truly great, Jerry.

14:25.715 --> 14:28.891
–Really?
–You pushed just the right amount.

14:28.926 --> 14:32.094
You made your point
without alienating the jury.

14:32.103 --> 14:33.747
Brilliant!

14:39.699 --> 14:42.457
My feeling is we need
to have Erica testify.

14:42.457 --> 14:43.565
It's risky,

14:43.600 --> 14:46.096
but I'm not sure we have
any other choice.

14:46.096 --> 14:48.557
Have you considered
this aborted 911 call?

14:48.557 --> 14:49.927
How do we account for that?

14:49.927 --> 14:53.366
Erica, upon discovering the body,
began to call 911,

14:53.401 --> 14:55.760
and that's when she went
into the blackout.

14:55.760 --> 14:57.659
That could work.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.365
What about Renée? Do we call her?

15:01.400 --> 15:02.884
I think so.

15:02.919 --> 15:07.625
To the extent we want the jury
to see her as a potential killer,

15:07.660 --> 15:11.545
we should expose them
to her odd demeanor.

15:12.647 --> 15:15.410
Okay, first we'll call Erica,

15:15.445 --> 15:17.944
save Renée for last.

15:22.407 --> 15:23.703
Is…

15:25.625 --> 15:29.491
Jerry, what's wrong?

15:30.981 --> 15:32.684
Nothing.

15:32.719 --> 15:34.388
Jerry…

15:39.811 --> 15:42.836
When I was in law school,

15:43.126 --> 15:47.446
my dream wasn't so much
the big trial as…

15:47.481 --> 15:51.289
well, I guess this…

15:52.329 --> 15:56.486
Having a drink at the end
of the day with co-counsel,

15:56.521 --> 16:00.234
battle-weary, rehashing the day,

16:00.269 --> 16:02.302
discussing strategy,

16:02.337 --> 16:07.414
the whole socialization of lawyering that…

16:08.006 --> 16:12.201
well, until now, I've never experienced.

16:12.236 --> 16:16.396
It's a rich feeling, whatever it is.

16:18.124 --> 16:20.177
It's called friendship.

16:23.032 --> 16:25.265
To friendship, my colleague.

16:26.632 --> 16:29.311
Right on my balcony?

16:30.838 --> 16:32.230
Denny…

16:32.932 --> 16:34.210
it's not what you think.

16:34.210 --> 16:35.630
I saw you.

16:35.960 --> 16:37.525
I heard you.

16:37.560 --> 16:39.955
We were just talking.

16:46.503 --> 16:48.115
Oh, dear.

16:50.275 --> 16:53.237
Exchanging intimate thoughts?

16:53.707 --> 16:55.907
On my own balcony.

16:57.026 --> 16:59.592
I never saw it coming.

16:59.878 --> 17:02.106
Things have been so good
between us lately.

17:02.106 --> 17:06.790
Well, Denny, it doesn't really sound
like he was necessarily being unfaithful.

17:06.790 --> 17:08.140
Of all the times.

17:08.175 --> 17:11.230
I'm feeling vulnerable as it is
over my law practice.

17:11.230 --> 17:13.979
You mean not getting the big cases?

17:14.013 --> 17:15.522
Yeah.

17:16.213 --> 17:18.829
I would really encourage you, Denny,

17:18.864 --> 17:25.059
to fill this void with something
deeper, more meaningful.

17:26.040 --> 17:29.411
It's time to come home to Bella.

17:32.110 --> 17:34.209
I don't know, Bella.

17:34.466 --> 17:37.435
I'll let you crawl into my warm spot.

17:41.557 --> 17:43.850
Come home to Bella.

17:48.538 --> 17:50.931
If he does have her,
her life could be in danger.

17:50.931 --> 17:52.234
I realize that,

17:52.269 --> 17:54.605
but I can't get a warrant just
with what you're telling me.

17:54.605 --> 17:56.846
You could at least pay him a visit.

17:56.846 --> 17:57.852
We could,

17:57.887 --> 18:00.127
but it might be better if you guys did.

18:00.127 --> 18:00.975
Us?

18:00.976 --> 18:03.090
Well, if he loves attention
as much as you're saying,

18:03.090 --> 18:04.513
then he might invite you in.

18:04.513 --> 18:06.069
And maybe you could hear
or see something

18:06.069 --> 18:09.383
I could take to a magistrate
and get a search warrant.

18:09.383 --> 18:10.135
Jeffrey?

18:10.170 --> 18:11.272
He's not gonna let me in.

18:11.272 --> 18:12.574
I'm Mr Dirty Mouth.

18:12.609 --> 18:14.013
Well, he still likes me.

18:14.013 --> 18:14.478
I'll go.

18:14.478 --> 18:15.429
Oh, now we're safe.

18:15.429 --> 18:16.312
What did you say?

18:16.312 --> 18:17.532
All right!

18:18.460 --> 18:20.754
Detective, we found something.

18:20.789 --> 18:22.411
It's a little sordid.

18:22.446 --> 18:23.679
What?

18:52.370 --> 18:53.993
You gotta be kidding.

19:03.933 --> 19:07.527
Claire! Braddy boy!
What a surprise!

19:07.562 --> 19:08.917
Hello, Lincoln.

19:08.952 --> 19:10.237
Listen, evidently,

19:10.272 --> 19:13.992
the police are still asking questions
about you on the judge Potts murder.

19:13.992 --> 19:15.423
They want another statement,

19:15.423 --> 19:17.512
so we thought we'd best
have a little conversation.

19:17.512 --> 19:18.869
Uh, can we come in?

19:18.904 --> 19:22.238
Why didn't you call and
have me come into the office?

19:22.238 --> 19:26.620
Well, we thought we'd just
head right over.

19:26.655 --> 19:28.424
I don't believe you.

19:28.459 --> 19:30.193
Can we come in, Lincoln?

19:30.228 --> 19:31.240
No.

19:37.681 --> 19:39.654
I walked through the door.

19:40.385 --> 19:42.579
I saw her hanging.

19:43.245 --> 19:45.312
She was dead?

19:45.347 --> 19:48.052
Her hands were tied behind her back.

19:48.087 --> 19:50.757
I got on a chair and cut the rope off.

19:50.792 --> 19:53.010
I couldn't reach the noose part.

19:53.045 --> 19:55.234
That's the last thing
I remember, actually,

19:55.234 --> 19:59.078
trying to reach up and cut
the rope around her neck.

19:59.113 --> 20:01.434
And then what happened?

20:01.469 --> 20:03.756
The next thing, it was…

20:04.130 --> 20:07.248
two hours later. That's
when I called for help.

20:07.283 --> 20:11.141
You have no memory of those two hours?

20:11.176 --> 20:13.906
I've been treated for
a psychiatric disorder.

20:13.906 --> 20:16.929
I've had some blackouts on occasion.

20:16.964 --> 20:19.953
When you say you called for help,

20:19.988 --> 20:21.543
you mean you called your lawyer?

20:21.543 --> 20:22.160
Yes.

20:22.161 --> 20:23.629
Why didn't you call the police?

20:23.629 --> 20:25.552
I suppose I was afraid,

20:25.587 --> 20:28.631
especially since I had no memory
of the previous two hours.

20:28.631 --> 20:30.143
What were you afraid of?

20:30.143 --> 20:33.456
That maybe you had killed Paula Wilkes?

20:33.491 --> 20:36.770
She left you for that woman,
Renée Winger.

20:36.805 --> 20:37.997
Yes.

20:38.032 --> 20:42.718
Did you go to confront Renée Winger
two nights before Ms Wilkes' death?

20:44.440 --> 20:45.422
I, I beg your pardon?

20:45.422 --> 20:48.682
Ms Winger says you confronted
her in a hotel lounge

20:48.682 --> 20:50.493
and started screaming at her.

20:50.493 --> 20:52.235
Many people witnessed this.

20:52.235 --> 20:57.384
You told her she'd regret it if
she continued to see Paula Wilkes.

20:57.419 --> 20:59.763
I have no memory of that.

20:59.798 --> 21:02.108
You have no memory of that?

21:02.143 --> 21:03.891
No. I…

21:03.926 --> 21:05.639
I swear.

21:07.470 --> 21:09.029
I swear.

21:13.126 --> 21:15.372
I hope they don't go
running to the police.

21:15.372 --> 21:17.584
I would hate to have
the police barge in here

21:17.584 --> 21:19.653
while my spring bow is cocked.

21:19.688 --> 21:21.800
I mean, somebody could get hurt.

21:23.215 --> 21:24.905
Lincoln…

21:25.130 --> 21:28.072
I have one question for you.

21:29.071 --> 21:31.079
Why?

21:31.114 --> 21:35.062
You've lived your whole life within
the bounds of the law, Lincoln.

21:35.062 --> 21:40.191
Now you display a desperation that…

21:41.056 --> 21:43.575
What's happened in your life, Lincoln?

21:43.610 --> 21:46.118
Well, this whole global warming thing…

21:46.130 --> 21:48.550
Was it Marcia Hooper?

21:52.856 --> 21:55.915
You were in love with her,
weren't you?

21:56.314 --> 21:58.119
I think it's hard for you
to live without her.

21:58.119 --> 22:00.507
I don't need Marcia Hooper.

22:00.542 --> 22:03.873
I have you, Shirley.

22:13.698 --> 22:16.319
She really did like me.

22:17.661 --> 22:21.530
Her husband made her
get that restraining order.

22:22.231 --> 22:24.791
She was kind to me.

22:26.235 --> 22:28.575
She liked me.

22:32.325 --> 22:33.953
We…

22:33.988 --> 22:38.248
we all live our lives
out on a ledge, Lincoln.

22:38.283 --> 22:42.508
It takes surprisingly little
to push us over.

22:42.543 --> 22:46.217
This was a devastating tragedy
for you, losing her.

22:46.252 --> 22:49.892
Add to that, people denying
your relationship…

22:49.927 --> 22:53.423
I don't want to talk
about it anymore.

22:57.959 --> 22:59.997
Lincoln, how does this end?

23:00.032 --> 23:01.650
I don't know.

23:03.668 --> 23:07.148
I never meant to harm you
when I took you, Shirley.

23:07.183 --> 23:09.426
Of course I didn't.

23:11.096 --> 23:15.973
But I suppose I've painted
myself into a bit of a corner.

23:20.049 --> 23:22.960
If this is a game, Lincoln,

23:23.579 --> 23:25.536
you win.

23:27.628 --> 23:29.276
I'm afraid.

23:33.877 --> 23:36.559
Maybe she doesn't remember doing it,

23:36.594 --> 23:39.164
but what other possible
explanation could there be?

23:39.164 --> 23:42.311
Maybe Renée somehow got in
the building without being detected.

23:42.311 --> 23:45.018
Maybe the husband did it
inside of four minutes.

23:45.018 --> 23:47.691
Maybe somebody else
who lived in the building.

23:47.691 --> 23:51.905
Alan, I'm like a human polygraph.

23:51.940 --> 23:54.028
I can sense the truth.

23:54.063 --> 23:58.058
Erica's telling the truth when she says
it's not in her to commit murder.

23:58.058 --> 24:00.352
Renée is not a truthful person.

24:00.387 --> 24:03.696
And the husband,
he is a truthful person,

24:03.731 --> 24:05.798
but there's something…

24:05.833 --> 24:10.070
well, I, I don't think he's being
entirely truthful here.

24:10.938 --> 24:13.345
You're a human polygraph?

24:13.380 --> 24:14.749
I never knew this.

24:14.784 --> 24:19.080
It's one of the reasons why I so implicitly
and immediately trusted you.

24:19.080 --> 24:21.585
I was drawn to your honesty.

24:22.219 --> 24:27.266
Jerry, I think one of the reasons
I'm drawn to you…

24:33.107 --> 24:34.767
Oh, dear.

24:46.863 --> 24:48.708
Don't talk to me.

24:48.743 --> 24:50.490
It's not like I went fishing with him.

24:50.490 --> 24:52.249
And don't make fun of me.

24:57.242 --> 24:59.341
I don't know whether you know this,

24:59.341 --> 25:05.955
not many men take
the time every day to…

25:06.345 --> 25:09.544
have a cigar, a glass of scotch,

25:09.579 --> 25:12.708
to talk to their best friend.

25:12.743 --> 25:16.228
That's not something most men have.

25:16.486 --> 25:18.457
No, it isn't.

25:24.893 --> 25:28.105
What I give to you,
what, what I share,

25:28.140 --> 25:29.573
I do with no one else.

25:29.573 --> 25:31.260
I like to think what you give to me,

25:31.260 --> 25:32.614
you do with nobody else.

25:32.614 --> 25:34.841
Now that, that may sound silly to you,

25:34.841 --> 25:36.998
but here's what I think is silly…

25:36.998 --> 25:44.026
the idea that jealousy or fidelity
is reserved for romance.

25:44.061 --> 25:49.475
I always suspected that there was
a connection between you and that man,

25:49.510 --> 25:54.507
that you got something
you didn't get from me.

25:55.995 --> 25:58.640
I probably do.

26:00.507 --> 26:02.717
But, gosh…

26:02.752 --> 26:05.850
what I get from you, Denny…

26:13.187 --> 26:17.886
People walk around today calling
everyone their best friend.

26:20.080 --> 26:25.280
The term doesn't have
any real meaning anymore.

26:25.315 --> 26:27.350
Mere acquaintances are lavished

26:27.350 --> 26:31.752
with hugs and kisses upon a second
or at most third meeting.

26:31.787 --> 26:35.297
Birthday cards get passed around offices

26:35.332 --> 26:39.764
so everybody can scribble
a snippet of sentimentality

26:39.799 --> 26:43.556
for a colleague they've barely met.

26:43.591 --> 26:47.314
And everyone just loves everyone.

26:47.349 --> 26:52.715
As a result, when you tell somebody
you love them today…

26:53.490 --> 26:56.231
it isn't much heard.

26:58.268 --> 27:00.343
I love you, Denny.

27:02.714 --> 27:05.240
You are my best friend.

27:06.537 --> 27:13.665
I can't imagine going
through life without you…

27:14.065 --> 27:17.211
as my best friend.

27:23.880 --> 27:26.629
I'm not gonna kiss you, however.

27:33.406 --> 27:37.294
I don't want you on my balcony,
on any balcony…

27:37.329 --> 27:40.351
alone with that man.

27:41.694 --> 27:43.317
Okay.

27:58.798 --> 28:00.988
Déjà vu.

28:01.023 --> 28:02.549
That's French.

28:02.584 --> 28:04.828
All set for your testimony, Renée?

28:04.847 --> 28:06.174
I'm nervous.

28:06.209 --> 28:09.241
I'm not as funny when I'm nervous.

28:10.215 --> 28:12.023
Let's cut to it, Ms Winger.

28:12.058 --> 28:17.361
You and the decedent, Paula Wilkes
were involved romantically?

28:17.396 --> 28:18.538
Yes.

28:18.573 --> 28:21.259
We'd met about a month
prior to her death.

28:21.259 --> 28:26.998
We began dating, and
it quickly became exclusive.

28:28.243 --> 28:30.819
Well, uh, by, when you say, “exclusive,”

28:30.819 --> 28:33.326
that's understating it a bit, isn't it?

28:33.326 --> 28:36.598
I don't know.
It certainly escalated quickly.

28:36.633 --> 28:39.514
Whether it would have
sustained is hard to say.

28:39.514 --> 28:42.425
She died so early in the relationship.

28:42.460 --> 28:45.084
Well, she must have
thought it would sustain.

28:45.084 --> 28:50.687
After all, she redid her will rather
suddenly in her own handwriting,

28:50.722 --> 28:52.812
leaving everything to you.

28:52.847 --> 28:56.330
Um, I'm a little embarrassed about that.

28:56.365 --> 28:59.813
We were in Las Vegas.
We were, I guess,

28:59.848 --> 29:05.355
in the throes of new love where people
can be prone to doing crazy things.

29:05.390 --> 29:09.339
And a month later, she shockingly
turns up dead, hanged.

29:09.374 --> 29:14.759
Mr Shore, I'm very happy
to answer your questions, but

29:14.794 --> 29:19.913
I would appreciate it if you'd be a little
less flippant about Paula's death.

29:24.428 --> 29:27.273
Ms Winger, I'm so, I, it…

29:27.308 --> 29:33.876
I, I can't help but notice your demeanor
seems remarkably different today

29:33.911 --> 29:37.692
than in all my prior encounters with you.

29:37.727 --> 29:40.591
Well, I… I guess I'm…

29:40.626 --> 29:43.844
I'm a little nervous to be in court.

29:47.743 --> 29:50.028
I don't think she came off a killer.

29:50.028 --> 29:51.250
I'm going to prison.

29:51.250 --> 29:53.074
Blessed are the merciful for they are…

29:53.074 --> 29:54.863
Erica, she didn't really
hurt our case here.

29:54.863 --> 29:56.829
She said nothing to incriminate you.

29:56.829 --> 29:58.726
We just lost her as a red herring.

29:58.726 --> 30:00.810
Do we even have anything else to offer?

30:00.810 --> 30:04.367
Well, just one of my overwritten
closing arguments,

30:04.402 --> 30:07.372
but they've been known
to work in the past.

30:08.929 --> 30:10.192
Was that helpful?

30:10.227 --> 30:12.600
That was quite a performance, Renée.

30:12.600 --> 30:14.976
Maybe that was the real me,

30:15.011 --> 30:18.404
and all this time I've been
performing with you.

30:27.616 --> 30:29.409
Any thoughts?

30:29.668 --> 30:30.826
None.

30:31.029 --> 30:33.123
He's got her. I can feel it.
She's in that house.

30:33.123 --> 30:34.797
Yeah, he practically baited us.

30:34.797 --> 30:36.753
I say we just charge in there,
police or no police.

30:36.753 --> 30:37.526
I can do it.

30:37.526 --> 30:39.764
Brad, the last time you did that,
you chopped off a priest's fingers.

30:39.764 --> 30:41.449
We are not trained to storm.

30:41.449 --> 30:43.064
I was a marine! I'm trained.

30:43.064 --> 30:45.698
I'm practically a navy SEAL, and I saw that.

30:45.698 --> 30:49.348
Did the detectives say what it would
take to satisfy reasonable suspicion?

30:49.348 --> 30:50.988
Something more than a hunch,

30:50.988 --> 30:53.824
which is, let's face it, all we have.

30:53.859 --> 30:55.384
What's going on, a party?

30:55.384 --> 30:57.853
This is not a time for
your nonsense, okay, sport?

30:57.853 --> 31:00.422
Typically, you're a fan
of my nonsense, Brad.

31:00.422 --> 31:01.388
What's the matter?

31:01.388 --> 31:03.095
We think that Lincoln
has kidnapped Shirley.

31:03.095 --> 31:04.603
At least, we think it's possible.

31:04.603 --> 31:06.776
–What?
–He may have her in his house.

31:06.776 --> 31:08.914
Well, why don't the police just go get her?

31:08.914 --> 31:10.952
Because we don't have anything to go on,

31:10.952 --> 31:13.674
and the police can't get a warrant.

31:15.721 --> 31:18.907
Well, Lincoln told me in a phone
call he did have Shirley.

31:18.907 --> 31:20.312
I'll say as much in an affidavit.

31:20.312 --> 31:23.612
You'll take it to the police
and get your warrant.

31:25.500 --> 31:27.191
I'll go have that phone call now.

31:27.191 --> 31:30.029
You'll have my sworn statement in a minute.

31:41.462 --> 31:45.477
He just told this Alan Shore
he had Ms Schmidt?

31:45.512 --> 31:47.060
Apparently.

31:49.535 --> 31:54.371
Let's assume a mistake is going
to be made here, Russell.

31:54.406 --> 31:57.552
Which side do you want to err on?

32:01.106 --> 32:03.896
Okay, let's go see the magistrate.

32:28.121 --> 32:29.991
Jerry, what's wrong?

32:30.026 --> 32:33.717
I was going through the life insurance policy
in my typical meticulous fashion,

32:33.717 --> 32:36.058
and look what I found in the fine print.

32:36.058 --> 32:37.147
I highlighted it.

32:37.147 --> 32:39.324
Okay, Mr Beedle, we'll hear your summation.

32:39.324 --> 32:42.213
Actually, your honor, the defense
would like to call one last witness.

32:42.213 --> 32:43.320
You said you rested.

32:43.320 --> 32:44.498
We don't.

32:44.499 --> 32:47.508
The defense would like
to recall Sean Wilkes.

33:00.691 --> 33:05.332
Mr Wilkes, you've met my colleague
Jerry Espenson, have you not?

33:05.367 --> 33:06.991
I have.

33:07.026 --> 33:10.942
Jerry, it turns out,
is a human polygraph.

33:10.977 --> 33:14.305
He has a nose for
who's telling the truth

33:14.340 --> 33:17.634
and for who's a truthful person
in general.

33:17.669 --> 33:18.737
And the thing is,

33:18.737 --> 33:23.470
you struck him as one of those
generally truthful people

33:23.505 --> 33:25.267
who's not telling the truth here.

33:25.267 --> 33:27.218
Objection. Does counsel have a question?

33:27.218 --> 33:28.440
My question is,

33:28.475 --> 33:32.521
have you been honest
with this court, Mr Wilkes?

33:32.556 --> 33:33.499
Yes.

33:33.534 --> 33:37.645
Paula Wilkes' life insurance policy,
for which you are the sole beneficiary,

33:37.645 --> 33:40.070
has a settlement value of $1 million.

33:40.070 --> 33:46.032
Are there any exclusions
under your late wife's policy, sir?

33:46.600 --> 33:49.989
Uh, I think there are certain exclusions, yes.

33:50.024 --> 33:53.136
One being suicide.
The policy doesn't cover suicide.

33:53.136 --> 33:56.933
It says right here, uh, highlighted in yellow.

34:01.552 --> 34:06.263
I am sure it must have been…

34:07.106 --> 34:10.577
an unimaginable shock

34:10.612 --> 34:16.304
when you entered Paula's apartment
to see her hanging there.

34:17.598 --> 34:23.047
And as you picked up
the phone and dialed 911,

34:23.081 --> 34:25.478
another shocking reality hit you,

34:25.514 --> 34:30.134
one with crippling monetary consequences.

34:30.601 --> 34:33.387
It was you who aborted the 911 call,

34:33.422 --> 34:36.172
and then you did something foolish.

34:36.206 --> 34:41.021
You tried to make her tragic death
look like a murder.

34:42.261 --> 34:46.931
I'm sure charges of perjury are swirling
around in your head about now.

34:46.931 --> 34:48.984
Fortunately, by law,

34:49.018 --> 34:53.188
if a witness retakes the stand
and corrects his false statements,

34:53.188 --> 34:54.768
he can avoid those charges.

34:54.768 --> 35:00.125
So here's your chance, Mr Wilkes,
to set the record straight.

35:01.977 --> 35:04.352
Did you go into that apartment,

35:04.387 --> 35:07.555
discover that your ex-wife
had committed suicide

35:07.586 --> 35:11.283
and proceed to tie her hands,
move a chair,

35:11.318 --> 35:18.251
do whatever was necessary to make it
look like somebody had killed her?

35:30.271 --> 35:32.537
I was in shock.

35:34.661 --> 35:37.357
I wasn't thinking clearly.

35:41.847 --> 35:44.019
I'm so sorry.

35:45.976 --> 35:48.190
Your honor, the defense rests.

35:48.740 --> 35:50.625
Mr Wilkes, you may step down.

35:50.625 --> 35:53.332
The bailiff will remand
the witness into custody.

35:53.332 --> 35:57.642
At this time I'm dismissing
the charges against Ms Erica Dolenz.

35:57.677 --> 35:59.611
The defendant is free to go.

36:00.878 --> 36:02.026
Oh, my God!

36:02.061 --> 36:03.584
Jerry, you realize what you've done?

36:03.584 --> 36:06.818
You've secured the freedom
of an innocent person.

36:10.567 --> 36:12.878
Let's hope Denny doesn't walk in.

36:27.654 --> 36:29.244
Hey, may I join?

36:29.279 --> 36:30.834
I'm sorry, no.

36:31.064 --> 36:34.760
Why don't you tell him you were
practically a navy SEAL?

36:35.772 --> 36:40.235
♫ Want a plane that loops the loop ♫

36:40.270 --> 36:44.664
♫ Me, I want a hula hoop ♫

36:44.699 --> 36:48.993
♫ We can hardly stand the wait ♫

36:49.028 --> 36:52.600
♫ Please, Christmas, don't be late ♫

36:56.744 --> 36:59.325
Aren't you going to answer it?

37:14.461 --> 37:16.724
Your little friends called the police.

37:16.724 --> 37:18.610
That was a mistake!
–Lincoln…

37:18.610 --> 37:20.461
They've escalated the situation

37:20.461 --> 37:23.563
before I had a chance
to work out my exit plan.

37:32.019 --> 37:33.307
Lincoln, I can hear them.

37:33.307 --> 37:35.147
They're going through the entire house.

37:35.147 --> 37:37.978
From the outside, this room
looks like a pantry.

37:37.978 --> 37:41.938
It's a locked room in a basement!
You think they'll skip it?

37:47.726 --> 37:49.488
–Lincoln…
–Shut up!

37:49.523 --> 37:51.305
There's no way out of here.

37:51.775 --> 37:54.108
They're right outside the door, Lincoln.

37:54.108 --> 37:56.406
Wait a minute, this room isn't soundproof.

37:56.406 --> 37:58.316
Help! Help!

37:58.351 --> 38:02.674
Hey, one more scream like that,
and I will shoot you dead!

38:10.224 --> 38:11.989
Someone's down!

38:13.233 --> 38:14.900
Room secured!

38:16.256 --> 38:17.534
There she is.

38:19.255 --> 38:20.881
Before you all start hugging me,

38:20.881 --> 38:24.315
did any of you have the presence
of mind to bring vodka?

38:24.315 --> 38:27.672
A little antiseptic, a band-aid.

38:27.707 --> 38:30.851
It's just a flesh wound.

38:34.427 --> 38:35.783
So she's all right?

38:35.818 --> 38:37.972
Completely. She wouldn't
even go to the hospital.

38:37.972 --> 38:39.902
Oh, thank goodness.

38:39.937 --> 38:42.115
Thank you for telling me, Denise.

38:42.129 --> 38:43.489
Sure.

38:44.796 --> 38:46.490
Denise…

38:47.246 --> 38:50.536
it's news worth celebrating,
don't you think?

38:50.571 --> 38:51.991
Don't you ever give up?

38:51.991 --> 38:53.622
I do, actually.

38:53.657 --> 38:58.192
It's just, you don't really want me to.

38:58.400 --> 39:01.100
I must say, Denise, when I look at you,

39:01.135 --> 39:07.377
I see one of those little catholic schoolgirls
running around in her plaid skirt,

39:07.412 --> 39:10.990
always to class on time,
the first to raise her hand,

39:11.025 --> 39:14.663
the neatest of penmanship.

39:14.698 --> 39:18.149
And then when I look closer, I see…

39:18.184 --> 39:19.896
Shirley.

39:19.931 --> 39:22.782
Well, I'm glad to see things
haven't changed here.

39:22.782 --> 39:24.624
Shirley, are you okay?

39:24.659 --> 39:26.597
I am. Thank you.

39:26.632 --> 39:31.037
Lincoln was actually a very charming host
when he wasn't threatening to kill me.

39:31.037 --> 39:35.161
Alan, it's been brought
to my attention that

39:35.196 --> 39:38.882
you falsified an affidavit and
committed a fraud on the magistrate.

39:38.882 --> 39:39.848
Did I?

39:39.883 --> 39:43.612
As senior partner, I cannot tolerate
this kind of behavior,

39:43.612 --> 39:45.577
and if it happens again,

39:45.612 --> 39:47.484
you will be fired.

39:47.519 --> 39:49.383
No doubt.

39:50.402 --> 39:52.206
Thank you.

39:52.429 --> 39:55.669
You very likely saved my life.

39:55.953 --> 39:57.664
I must say, Shirley,

39:57.699 --> 39:59.340
when I look at you,

39:59.375 --> 40:02.845
I see one of those little
catholic schoolgirls…

40:02.880 --> 40:05.376
Oh, get a life!

40:16.537 --> 40:18.904
I'll sleep with her one day.

40:20.237 --> 40:21.775
No, you won't.

40:24.034 --> 40:28.598
You know, the brain supposedly
confuses fear with passion.

40:28.633 --> 40:32.129
She should be ripe with
passion, for God's sake.

40:32.410 --> 40:34.340
Denny, what ever happened
to that doll?

40:34.340 --> 40:36.200
The police took her in for questioning.

40:36.200 --> 40:37.964
Shirley Schmidtho?

40:37.999 --> 40:39.728
Yeah. She'll be back.

40:40.727 --> 40:42.496
Alan…

40:43.325 --> 40:45.608
I'm sorry I doubted your feelings.

40:45.643 --> 40:51.080
It was just seeing you
on the balcony with that man.

40:51.469 --> 40:56.048
Alan, what is it about out here?

40:57.667 --> 41:02.774
We're out on a ledge, 14 floors
to a spectacular death.

41:02.809 --> 41:07.934
It probably gives us a sense of
our mortality, which in turn…

41:08.448 --> 41:11.627
there's nothing so
life-affirming, I suppose,

41:11.662 --> 41:16.601
as a little death tucked
in the back of our mind.

41:16.636 --> 41:21.541
When I die, I want my remains
sprinkled off of here.

41:22.962 --> 41:24.703
–You?
–The balcony?

41:24.738 --> 41:27.482
Could there be any place more fitting?

41:28.124 --> 41:30.281
I suppose not.

41:32.019 --> 41:34.716
But since I don't want to be cremated,

41:34.751 --> 41:39.040
somebody should at least yell,
“look out below. ”

41:39.961 --> 41:43.324
Ah, the simple pleasures.

41:44.415 --> 41:48.992
A clear night, a scotch, a friend…

41:49.218 --> 41:52.081
Even if he is high-maintenance.

41:58.172 --> 42:00.397
To simple pleasures.
