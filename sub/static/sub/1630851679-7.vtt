22:56.242 --> 22:57.541

Ungh! Agh!

23:08.921 --> 23:11.288

- (sighs)

23:11.290 --> 23:12.556
Hey, sweetheart.

23:12.592 --> 23:14.758
Mommy's just a little bit tired.

23:14.794 --> 23:18.295
How's your puzzle coming?
- Almost finished.

23:19.899 --> 23:25.970
♪♪♪

23:27.607 --> 23:30.107
- Good news, we located
a mountain bluebird.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.309
- Really? That was fast!

23:32.378 --> 23:33.411
- We didn't actually find one,

23:33.546 --> 23:35.446
We just did some online
research.

23:35.515 --> 23:37.982
- A conservation group set up
a bunch of nesting boxes

23:38.117 --> 23:39.884
Just outside of okotoks.

23:40.019 --> 23:41.452
If you head over there,

23:41.521 --> 23:43.587
You're guaranteed
to see a bluebird.

23:43.722 --> 23:45.423
- Except for that I promised
gladys

23:45.558 --> 23:47.991
A birdwatching trail ride here,
not in okotoks.

23:48.060 --> 23:49.660
- Well, finding a bluebird here

23:49.662 --> 23:51.996
Would be like looking for
a needle in a haystack.

23:52.131 --> 23:55.699
It makes way more sense to take
gladys to the nesting boxes.

23:55.735 --> 23:58.469
- Hmm... Maybe I was wrong
about you two.

23:58.604 --> 24:00.137
- What do you mean?

24:00.206 --> 24:01.672
You asked us to find
a bluebird nest,

24:01.741 --> 24:03.541
And that's exactly what we did.

24:03.543 --> 24:05.676
- No, I asked you to find
a nest on the property.

24:05.811 --> 24:08.879
So, I'm sorry, no bird...
No bonus.

24:08.881 --> 24:10.814
- But that's not fair!

24:10.817 --> 24:13.283
- That is business.

24:13.319 --> 24:14.652
Now, if you'll excuse me,

24:14.787 --> 24:17.221
I'm gonna have to go and break
the news to gladys.

24:17.223 --> 24:19.323
- Uh, don't say anything
to her yet.

24:19.458 --> 24:22.893
We'll do some more research,
and see what we can find.

24:23.028 --> 24:24.562
- Okay. The trail ride
is tomorrow,

24:24.564 --> 24:26.396
So you don't have a lot of time.

24:26.466 --> 24:28.665
- We won't let you down.
- Okay.

24:30.903 --> 24:33.804
- More research? We literally
looked at everything

24:33.939 --> 24:36.039
There is online about
mountain bluebirds.

24:36.108 --> 24:38.242
We're never going to find one.

24:38.244 --> 24:41.645
- What is with you today?
You're so negative.

24:41.714 --> 24:44.381
- I'm just being realistic.
- You're not even trying.

24:44.383 --> 24:45.983
Same with the card game earlier.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.718
You gave up before
it was even over.

24:47.853 --> 24:49.587
- Nothing ever works out
the way I want it to,

24:49.589 --> 24:52.356
So why bother?
- (sighs) fine.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.258
You stay here and feel sorry
for yourself,

24:54.393 --> 24:56.359
But I'm gonna go earn
that bonus.

25:00.266 --> 25:01.532

25:14.947 --> 25:16.614

25:16.616 --> 25:18.582
- Yeah, that yearling gave him
a hard time.

25:18.618 --> 25:20.985
I think he's spooked.
Maybe you oughta call it a day.

25:21.120 --> 25:23.219
- No, there's too much work.
I'm fine.

25:23.256 --> 25:25.322
- You're not fine.
You're distracted,

25:25.358 --> 25:27.157
And I think we both know why.

25:27.293 --> 25:29.693
- Am I about to get a classic
jack bartlett lecture

25:29.695 --> 25:32.096
On why violence is never
the answer?

25:32.231 --> 25:34.398
- No, you're not.
I wouldn't waste my breath.

25:34.400 --> 25:35.633
You know what you did.

25:35.768 --> 25:37.434
- Yeah, and you know
what you did.

25:37.503 --> 25:39.403
- What's that?
- Nothin'! You stood there.

25:41.841 --> 25:43.574
You treated that
trigger-happy idiot

25:43.709 --> 25:46.110
Like he was a human being,
instead of the criminal

25:46.245 --> 25:47.578
That ruined amy's life!

25:47.647 --> 25:49.580
- What should I have done?
Punch him, too?

25:49.715 --> 25:51.915
Run him over with my truck?
An eye for an eye?

25:51.984 --> 25:53.383
- Exactly.
- Yeah?

25:53.419 --> 25:54.918
How's that working out for ya?

25:54.921 --> 25:56.320
- Just fine.
- Really?

25:56.389 --> 25:58.589

yourself back to the ranch

25:58.724 --> 26:00.257

26:00.326 --> 26:02.593
You were out all night,
weren't you?

26:02.662 --> 26:04.795
- I went for a drive.
- Yeah?

26:04.864 --> 26:06.430
How'd your wife feel
about that?

26:06.565 --> 26:08.999
- None of your business.
- You're right, it's not.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.601
But what happens out here
with the cattle,

26:10.736 --> 26:13.337
That is my business, and you're
not fit to be working!

26:13.472 --> 26:15.171

- Shut your trap,

26:15.207 --> 26:16.907
I'm not finished!

26:16.909 --> 26:19.009
