first thing in the morning.

00:07.097 --> 00:08.999
You're three minutes late,

00:09.000 --> 00:11.601
Not my fault.

Oh, come on, really?
I'm a few minutes late,

00:21.855 --> 00:23.273
so you're gonna call me out
in front of everyone?

00:23.291 --> 00:25.317
Good idea.
Everyone?

00:25.330 --> 00:28.072
Gather round, so I can call out
Peralta in front of you.

00:28.106 --> 00:31.284
Okay, fine.
I was three minutes late.

00:31.285 --> 00:33.022
I'm sorry for doing
one thing wrong.

00:33.056 --> 00:35.535
- Oh, it's more than one thing.
- Uh-oh.

Let's start
with the Kristov murder.

00:36.662 --> 00:37.965
It was
an amazing solve.

00:37.966 --> 00:39.235
I got him to confess
in 20 minutes.

00:39.236 --> 00:40.672
You also mislabeled
the evidence,

00:40.673 --> 00:42.712
so that confession
is worthless

00:42.746 --> 00:44.485
if the sergeant
hadn't caught your mistake.

00:44.486 --> 00:46.388
Here are three cases

One is your locker.

The other is a garbage dump
in the Philippines.

00:52.872 --> 00:57.613
Can you tell
which is which?

00:57.614 --> 01:00.017
- That one's the dump?
- They're both your locker.

01:00.051 --> 01:01.586
Gah, I should've guessed that.
He's good.

01:01.587 --> 01:04.989
This folder is labeled
"undies, dirty."

01:05.024 --> 01:07.025
So I won't confuse it
with "undies, clean."

01:07.060 --> 01:08.862

about all these rules?

01:08.898 --> 01:11.433

Look, if I have to do things
his way,

08:50.689 --> 08:52.023
I'm gonna do them
my way.

08:52.024 --> 08:53.991
[Laughs]
Okay, man.

08:53.992 --> 08:56.161
It was nice working with you.
[Laughs]

08:56.193 --> 08:57.893
I'm not scared of him,
okay?

08:57.928 --> 09:00.531
I'm not scared
of anyone.

09:00.532 --> 09:02.332
Oh, also, the tagger drew
a penis on your minivan.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.166
I'm sorry.
Please don't chase after me.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.713
What?
There's a penis on my minivan?

09:07.837 --> 09:10.272
High ceilings,
three bedrooms.

09:10.273 --> 09:12.677
Why does every perp
have a nicer place than I do?

09:12.708 --> 09:14.810
You know what they don't
teach you at the academy?

09:14.811 --> 09:15.932
It's better to be
a criminal.

09:15.946 --> 09:19.317
Oh, no.
The cabinets are blue.

09:19.318 --> 09:21.121
Tacky.
Not a deal breaker, though.

09:21.122 --> 09:22.490
I'd just repaint it.

09:22.524 --> 09:24.359
The psychic predicted
the drugs

09:24.360 --> 09:25.640
would be found
in something blue.

09:25.661 --> 09:28.796
[Slow motion]
I see the color blue.

09:28.797 --> 09:30.799
She also made this really
depressing prediction

09:30.800 --> 09:32.134
about my life.

09:32.135 --> 09:35.171
[Slow motion]
She will never love you back.

09:35.205 --> 09:37.910
And if she's right
about where we find the drugs,

09:37.911 --> 09:39.111
that means she's right
about the other thing.

09:39.145 --> 09:41.380
- Uh-huh.
- Kitchen.

09:44.351 --> 09:46.521
- Whoa.
- Jackpot.

09:46.522 --> 09:48.726
There's way more
than 12 keys in here.

09:48.727 --> 09:49.894
Where was it?

09:49.928 --> 09:51.663
Baseboard,
behind the hamper.

09:51.697 --> 09:53.498
What color
was the hamper?

09:53.499 --> 09:54.498
- <i>Green.</i>
- Yes.

09:54.499 --> 09:55.832
The clothes hamper
was green.

09:55.833 --> 09:58.904
The clothes hamper was green!

09:58.938 --> 10:00.706
Drinks on me.

10:00.740 --> 10:02.640
[Laughs]
You're weird.

10:02.675 --> 10:04.509
[Engine starts]

10:04.510 --> 10:07.178
Sorry this is
taking so long.

10:07.179 --> 10:08.379
Still writing up
my report.

10:08.413 --> 10:10.082
Pretty detailed.

10:10.116 --> 10:12.284
Hey, Gina, can you look up
what the humidity was

10:12.285 --> 10:14.687
about an hour ago and also
what moon cycle we're in?

10:14.688 --> 10:17.992
No, sorry.
Don't feel like it, no.

10:18.027 --> 10:21.195
Thanks, Gina.

10:21.196 --> 10:23.031
And now to you.
What's your name?

10:23.032 --> 10:24.900
My name is
banana fartman, md.

10:24.935 --> 10:26.269
I don't believe you.

10:26.304 --> 10:28.404
Come on, man.
Just tell me who you are.

10:28.405 --> 10:29.738
I need to fill
this thing out perfectly,

10:29.739 --> 10:31.507
so my boss
will get off my back.

10:31.542 --> 10:32.843
Are you a minor?
How old are you?

10:32.877 --> 10:34.778
I'm 610.
I'm a highlander.

10:34.779 --> 10:36.646
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna put that in there.

10:36.647 --> 10:38.882
And then you're gonna be tried
as an adult highlander.

10:38.883 --> 10:41.084
And they're gonna cut
your head off.

10:41.085 --> 10:42.286
Is that what you want?

10:42.320 --> 10:44.557
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news,

10:44.558 --> 10:46.728
but your psychic
friend's predictions

10:46.729 --> 10:48.398
about the drug case
were wrong,

10:48.399 --> 10:50.470
which means all
of her predictions are wrong.

10:50.504 --> 10:53.572
Mm-mm. No way.
She's never wrong.

10:53.573 --> 10:55.606
We found the cocaine
behind a green hamper.

10:55.607 --> 10:57.644
Never said green
or the letter "H."

10:57.678 --> 11:00.751
Mm-hmm, she said
"blue" and "yellow," Charles.

11:00.752 --> 11:02.986
I don't know if there's
any kindergarteners present,

11:02.987 --> 11:05.422
but those two colors combined
make green.

11:05.423 --> 11:09.227
She also mentioned
the letters "L" and "B,"

11:09.261 --> 11:12.566
and another name
for a hamper is...

11:12.600 --> 11:15.603
Lady bin?

11:15.604 --> 11:16.705
Laundry basket.

11:16.706 --> 11:18.442
Oh, little boo-boo.

11:18.476 --> 11:20.846
Can you go be depressed
over there?

11:20.847 --> 11:23.348
You're bumming out
my whole area.

11:23.382 --> 11:25.582
Baby, I've got
some bad news.

11:25.616 --> 11:30.454
Someone painted a giant penis
on our minivan.

11:30.455 --> 11:33.223
No, you cannot have
an SUV now.

11:33.224 --> 11:35.626
Those things roll, baby.
They roll!

11:35.627 --> 11:37.796
Hey, look at this.

11:37.797 --> 11:39.700
Your prints were
on file.

11:39.701 --> 11:42.874
Nice to meet you,
Trevor Podolski.

11:42.875 --> 11:48.146
Oh, Podolski, just like deputy
police commissioner Podolski.

11:48.147 --> 11:52.219
Your father is deputy
police commissioner Podolski.

11:52.220 --> 11:54.689
I'm not sure
how things work here,

11:54.690 --> 11:57.760
but does that mean
that your career is in my hands?

11:57.761 --> 12:00.498
Okay, you know what?

12:00.499 --> 12:01.667
Yes.

12:05.734 --> 12:07.868
20.2 kilos.

12:07.869 --> 12:09.169
I feel like
we could round up to 21.

12:09.203 --> 12:12.573
Or we could round down
to 20,

12:12.574 --> 12:16.243
take the extra 0.2,
sell it to our friends.

12:18.214 --> 12:19.983
[Giggles]

12:19.984 --> 12:22.252
I'll call the D.A.
Rosa, you log this in.

12:22.253 --> 12:23.854
Charles, maybe watch Gina.

12:23.855 --> 12:25.022
[Laughs]

12:25.057 --> 12:26.223
So what are
you doing tonight?

12:26.258 --> 12:29.194
Nothing.
What about you...

12:29.195 --> 12:30.530
Are doing tonight?

12:30.564 --> 12:33.370
Nothing.

12:33.404 --> 12:34.738
Carlene.

12:36.507 --> 12:39.242
Whelp, I hope you find
something to do.

12:39.243 --> 12:41.045
[Chuckles]

12:41.046 --> 12:44.415
I'm gonna pee.
That's what I'm doing tonight.

12:44.416 --> 12:46.851
No.

12:46.852 --> 12:48.253
[Sighs]

12:48.288 --> 12:50.889
Deputy commissioner's son, huh?
[Sighs]

12:50.924 --> 12:53.724
His decision to target cop cars
makes a lot more sense now.

12:53.725 --> 12:55.091
We gotta let him walk,
right?

12:55.126 --> 12:56.725
He defaced
nine police vehicles,

12:56.726 --> 12:58.025
and you caught him
red-handed.

12:58.026 --> 13:00.057
Why would you let him walk?
[Chuckles]

13:00.058 --> 13:02.959
Captain, I did all the work
on this perfectly.

13:02.960 --> 13:06.028
I mean, my report
has over 25 pages

13:06.029 --> 13:08.866
of meticulous research,
diagrams, and maps.

13:08.867 --> 13:11.772
I even put an "about the author"
section on the back.

13:11.806 --> 13:14.242
I did everything
you asked me to do,

13:14.276 --> 13:15.710
but this is
above my pay grade.

13:15.711 --> 13:17.245
You gotta make the call.

13:17.246 --> 13:20.714
You're the arresting officer.
It's your call.

13:20.715 --> 13:22.916
I told you to do
every part of your job,

13:22.917 --> 13:25.386
and making this call
is part of your job.

13:25.387 --> 13:28.891
- Yeah, but you think I should process him.
- Mm-hmm.

13:28.892 --> 13:30.626
Well, if I do,
the deputy commissioner

13:30.627 --> 13:32.161
could ruin my career,
and I'll end up on the streets

13:32.162 --> 13:34.064
selling my beautiful body
for a can of beans.

13:34.065 --> 13:35.767
Mm-hmm.

13:35.768 --> 13:38.905
Has anyone ever told you
you look exactly like a statue?

13:38.906 --> 13:40.273
Yes.

13:40.274 --> 13:43.977
Man, you were totally right
about the cocaine,

13:43.978 --> 13:45.913
and you were also right
about Rosa.

13:45.914 --> 13:47.648
Who's Rosa?
The woman I...

13:47.682 --> 13:49.616
The woman who doesn't
love him back.

13:49.617 --> 13:51.084
Oh.
Yes, that woman.

13:51.085 --> 13:52.852
You know, it can be a burden
to always know

13:52.853 --> 13:54.353
what's gonna happen
in the future.

13:54.354 --> 13:55.921
Don't get out
of the chair.

13:55.922 --> 13:58.325
I just had a vision
of you leaving this chair

13:58.326 --> 13:59.960
and getting
seriously injured.

13:59.994 --> 14:01.494
Oh, my God.

14:01.529 --> 14:03.628
I should probably wheel you
back to your desk.

14:03.662 --> 14:05.763
That is a great idea.
Wheel you off a bridge.

14:05.764 --> 14:07.264
[Laughs]
I'm kidding.

14:07.265 --> 14:09.597
♪ Oh, you're alone

14:09.598 --> 14:12.101
♪ Uh-oh, you're alone
for life ♪

14:12.102 --> 14:14.105
So here are my options.

14:14.106 --> 14:16.707
One, I process
Podolski's kid,

14:16.708 --> 14:18.475
he fires me, and I spend
the rest of my career

14:18.476 --> 14:21.313
as a Detective, third grade,
which is literally pathetic.

14:21.314 --> 14:24.086
No offense, Hitchcock.
None taken.

14:24.120 --> 14:26.290
Option two,
I let him walk,

14:26.291 --> 14:27.525
and I spend the rest
of my life with Holt

14:27.526 --> 14:29.460
as my babysitter.

14:29.461 --> 14:31.295
Honestly, when I think about
spending the rest of my life

14:31.296 --> 14:32.796
with a babysitter,

14:32.797 --> 14:35.232
she's kind of a cute blonde
named Erica,

14:35.233 --> 14:36.702
and she always has
pizza money

14:36.703 --> 14:38.071
and lets me stay up as late
as I want.

14:38.072 --> 14:39.675
How old are you
in this scenario?

14:39.676 --> 14:41.745
Anyway, the point is
Holt cares more

14:41.746 --> 14:44.314
about whether I
"do my job right"

14:44.315 --> 14:46.017
than whether I have a job
at all.

14:46.018 --> 14:47.386
So I'm taking suggestions.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.256
I say piss off Holt,

14:49.257 --> 14:51.258
so we get to watch your career
end right in front of us.

14:51.259 --> 14:53.093
Okay, thank you
for that, Santiago.

14:53.094 --> 14:54.562
I'm gonna put you down
for "don't arrest,"

14:54.563 --> 14:56.064
and I'm also going
to put your phone number

14:56.065 --> 14:57.567
on every urinal
in Rikers.

14:57.568 --> 15:00.037
Don't arrest him.
Just smack him. Hard.

15:00.038 --> 15:01.505
With a phone book
on a body part

15:01.506 --> 15:03.004
no one can see,
you know what I'm saying?

15:03.005 --> 15:04.906
So you're suggesting
police brutality?

15:04.907 --> 15:07.109
Ha, ha, I guess so, yeah.
Why?

15:07.110 --> 15:09.111
- Hey, Scully.
- Yeah?

15:09.112 --> 15:10.682
You want this collar?
Paperwork's all done,

15:10.683 --> 15:13.351
and it's perfect.
The Podolski kid?

15:13.352 --> 15:15.186
Are you kidding?
I just gave him my lunch.

15:15.187 --> 15:18.055
Okay.
Boyle, what do you think?

15:18.056 --> 15:20.190
I don't know, man.
I'm lost.

15:20.191 --> 15:22.290
The universe is
a cruel and vexing puzzle.

15:22.291 --> 15:24.623
I-I'm at the whim
of the cosmos.

15:24.624 --> 15:27.361
All right, I'm gonna put
you down for "bummer,"

15:27.362 --> 15:31.898
and you can hang out in
that category all by yourself.

15:31.899 --> 15:33.599
Hey, everyone.

15:33.600 --> 15:37.369
Hey, Jake, there is a very sexy,
angry official here,

15:37.370 --> 15:39.204
deputy commissioner Podolski.

15:39.205 --> 15:41.975
He's asking for you.
Very angry.

15:41.976 --> 15:45.778
Elderly, sexy, furious.

15:45.812 --> 15:49.114
Well, my career
is over.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.714
See you at the bottom,
Hitchcock. No offense.

15:51.715 --> 15:54.813
No, none taken.

15:56.280 --> 15:57.547
Deputy commissioner.

15:57.548 --> 15:58.647
Where's my son?

15:58.648 --> 16:00.316
He is at my desk,

16:00.317 --> 16:02.821
enjoying a nice glass
of bubbly water

16:02.822 --> 16:05.058
and some chocolate I was saving
for a special occasion.

16:05.059 --> 16:06.729
Hey, Peralta,
when you're done,

16:06.730 --> 16:08.900
can you help me wrap up
this massive cocaine bust

16:08.901 --> 16:11.502
I just pulled off?
Thanks.

16:11.503 --> 16:14.071
Oh, deputy commissioner,
didn't see you there.

16:14.072 --> 16:15.672
Sorry for interrupting.

16:15.673 --> 16:17.340
Amy Santiago.

16:17.341 --> 16:18.908
[Sighs]

16:18.909 --> 16:21.078
Trevor, what'd you do
this time?

16:21.079 --> 16:22.313
Nothing.

16:22.347 --> 16:24.549
There you have it.
He said he did nothing.

16:24.584 --> 16:27.184
So I caught him red-handed
doing nothing?

16:27.185 --> 16:28.184
I'm saying maybe
it's a possibility

16:28.185 --> 16:29.650
you made a mistake.

16:29.684 --> 16:31.118
You know, normally,
I would agree with you,

16:31.119 --> 16:33.021
but I've been
pretty detail-oriented

16:33.022 --> 16:34.123
the last few hours.

16:34.124 --> 16:35.660
You might not
understand this,

16:35.661 --> 16:38.098
but Trevor is
a special kid.

16:38.099 --> 16:40.832
He makes straight "A"s.
He's going to Duke next year.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.934
Lacrosse scholarship.
Oh.

16:42.935 --> 16:45.705
Sometimes, boys
just need to be boys.

16:45.706 --> 16:48.811
You do realize
he did thousands of dollars

16:48.812 --> 16:50.846
worth of property damage,
though,

16:50.847 --> 16:52.481
to police vehicles.

16:52.482 --> 16:54.449
Look, I think
we can all agree

16:54.450 --> 16:56.552
that I'm ordering you
to let this slide

16:56.553 --> 16:58.189
because nothing happened.

16:58.190 --> 17:00.193
This is officially
out of your hands.

17:00.194 --> 17:03.633
Would you actually mind
just checking out my report?

17:03.634 --> 17:04.834
It's pretty thorough,

17:04.835 --> 17:07.335
and I spent over an hour
on fonts.

17:07.336 --> 17:08.502
Kinda snazzy, so...

17:08.502 --> 17:10.301
Oh, thank you.

17:10.303 --> 17:11.469
I'll get right to it.

17:11.470 --> 17:13.637
Thanks.
Trevor, let's go.

17:13.638 --> 17:16.340
Have a good one.

17:23.285 --> 17:25.286
Choo.

17:25.287 --> 17:26.387
Yes.

17:26.422 --> 17:28.021
What's up with the chair?

17:28.022 --> 17:31.491
Um, Carlene predicted
if I get out of this chair,

17:31.492 --> 17:33.827
I'd get badly hurt,
so I'm not chancing it.

17:33.861 --> 17:37.763
Oh, man.
There's no pudding cups left.

17:37.764 --> 17:39.965
Ah!
What'd you do that for?

17:39.999 --> 17:43.333
There.
Now you're hurt <i>in</i> this chair.

17:43.334 --> 17:44.801
You can get hurt anywhere,
Boyle.

17:44.802 --> 17:46.637
And if you do,
it won't be

17:46.638 --> 17:50.576
because some shoe salesman
predicted it.

17:50.610 --> 17:53.616
You make
your own destiny.

17:57.853 --> 18:00.987
Well, we don't have to worry
about Podolski's son anymore.

18:01.022 --> 18:02.889
The case is officially
out of my hands.

18:02.890 --> 18:04.056
No charges filed.

18:04.057 --> 18:05.660
Why is there yogurt
on this?

18:05.694 --> 18:07.395
The deputy commissioner
threw my report

18:07.396 --> 18:09.130
in Terry's trash can,

18:09.131 --> 18:10.796
and he'd been eating
yogurt earlier.

18:10.831 --> 18:13.764
Terry loves yogurt.

18:13.799 --> 18:16.167
Something wrong?
Kinda, yeah.

18:16.201 --> 18:17.904
I called six precincts
about this kid.

18:17.905 --> 18:19.707
He's been brought in
a dozen times.

18:19.708 --> 18:21.744
Theft, vandalism,
drunken disorderly,

18:21.745 --> 18:23.178
but he's never
been processed.

18:23.179 --> 18:26.011
His daddy comes in
and bails him out every time.

18:26.012 --> 18:27.378
He's a lucky little jerk.

18:27.379 --> 18:29.011
No, I wouldn't say
he was lucky.

18:29.012 --> 18:30.579
I feel bad for this kid.

18:30.580 --> 18:32.547
I mean,
what kind of father

18:32.548 --> 18:33.915
cares so little
for his son

18:33.916 --> 18:37.220
that he lets him get away
with everything?

18:37.221 --> 18:39.188
Well, he's someone else's
problem now.

18:39.189 --> 18:42.990
Like you said,
it's out of your hands.

18:42.991 --> 18:43.991
All right, I see
what you're trying to do,

18:43.992 --> 18:45.656
but it's not gonna work.

18:45.657 --> 18:47.492
I'm not going to arrest him.
I'm going to arrest him!

18:47.493 --> 18:49.862
- You want backup?
- Yes.

18:49.863 --> 18:53.032
[Siren wails]

18:54.768 --> 18:57.005
What is this?
You can't do this.

18:57.006 --> 18:58.473
Get that thing
outta here.

18:58.507 --> 18:59.841
Excuse me, sir.

18:59.842 --> 19:01.877
Trevor Podolski,
you're under arrest

19:01.878 --> 19:03.613
for vandalism
and destruction of property.

19:03.614 --> 19:05.048
What... dad!
What are you doing?

19:05.049 --> 19:06.251
I told you
to back off, Peralta.

19:06.286 --> 19:08.423
First off,
the name's Santiago,

19:08.424 --> 19:10.460
Detective Amy Santiago.

19:10.461 --> 19:12.361
Second, I'm arresting
your son,

19:12.396 --> 19:16.963
which, as I say it aloud,
seems like an unwise choice,

19:16.964 --> 19:18.799
but it's the one
I'm making.

19:18.800 --> 19:21.002
Once again,
my name is Amy Santiago.

19:21.037 --> 19:23.274
You're being stupid, Peralta.
Don't be stupid.

19:23.275 --> 19:25.110
I can make
your life miserable.

19:25.144 --> 19:27.881
Commissioner, please don't talk
to my Detective in that Tone.

19:27.882 --> 19:29.448
If you have a complaint,
you can take it up with me.

19:29.482 --> 19:33.083
You just made yourself
a very powerful enemy, Holt.

19:33.084 --> 19:35.818
I'm gonna be watching you,
both of you, like a hawk.

19:35.819 --> 19:36.919
You're gonna have to try
a little harder

19:36.920 --> 19:38.455
if you wanna scare me.

19:38.456 --> 19:40.757
I've been an openly gay cop
since 1987,

19:40.758 --> 19:43.826
so you're not the first
superior officer to threaten me.

19:43.827 --> 19:45.661
You know
how I'm still standing here?

19:45.662 --> 19:47.563
'Cause I do my job,

19:47.564 --> 19:50.167
and I do it right.

19:50.168 --> 19:51.570
Damn, son!

19:51.571 --> 19:53.538
Don't say "son."
Sorry.

19:53.573 --> 19:55.273
Deputy commissioner,
if you wanna pick Trevor up,

19:55.307 --> 19:58.142
he'll be
at the nine-nine.

19:58.143 --> 20:00.507
Let's go, fartman.

20:02.243 --> 20:03.944
Carlene was wrong, Gina.

20:03.945 --> 20:06.648
Rosa said it herself...
I'm in charge of my own destiny.

20:06.649 --> 20:08.318
That means she wants me
to make a move.

20:08.353 --> 20:10.488
Mm, but Carlene
was also right.

20:10.489 --> 20:12.924
You did get hurt
'cause Rosa punched you.

20:12.925 --> 20:14.591
And the fact that Rosa
punched you

20:14.592 --> 20:15.992
means she does not
like you.

20:16.027 --> 20:18.759
No, no, she punched me
to prove Carlene wrong.

20:18.794 --> 20:20.760
Move.

20:20.761 --> 20:22.128
Oh, wait,
I take it back.

20:22.129 --> 20:23.929
She definitely is
into you.

20:23.930 --> 20:27.067
So much chemistry.
I know, it's crazy.

20:27.101 --> 20:28.603
All right, let's get
this meeting started.

20:28.604 --> 20:29.772
<i>I'm not late.
I'm here.</i>

20:29.773 --> 20:33.781
[Alarm beeping]

20:37.388 --> 20:39.856
Right on time.

20:39.857 --> 20:41.792
You're out of uniform,
Peralta.

20:41.793 --> 20:43.862
Baby steps, Captain.

20:43.863 --> 20:46.682
Baby steps.
