GRACE: Previously on The Secret
Life of the American Teenager...

00:03.385 --> 00:06.120
We're never gonna get back
together again, are we?

00:06.155 --> 00:07.355
No, I don't think so.

00:07.389 --> 00:09.390
I changed my mind about Rachel.

00:09.425 --> 00:11.459
And I am grateful that you did.

00:11.493 --> 00:15.330
I really like that woman.
Maybe even enough to marry her.

00:15.364 --> 00:17.298
So you want me to quit my
job at the church nursery

00:17.333 --> 00:18.166
so that you can go help your ex-wife?

00:18.200 --> 00:20.468
If that's what I want to do, yeah.

00:20.502 --> 00:23.171
I just wanted to say face to face that

00:23.205 --> 00:27.408
I appreciate that we
could part amicably.

00:27.443 --> 00:29.344
And it wouldn't be the worst thing

00:29.378 --> 00:31.446
if my dad was in love with Kathleen.

00:31.480 --> 00:33.381
He's in love with his first wife,

00:33.415 --> 00:34.215
always has been, always will be.

00:37.186 --> 00:39.220
I'm happy we at least
have a dialogue going.

00:39.255 --> 00:43.191
This isn't a dialogue, this is a
contest to see who Dad loved the most.

00:43.225 --> 00:44.392
You told him to talk to me.

00:44.426 --> 00:46.261
I just didn't know he was
here talking to you right now.

00:51.367 --> 00:53.167
What's going on?

00:53.202 --> 00:54.235
If Adrian is going to
be a part of your life,

00:54.270 --> 00:56.204
then I wanted to get to know Adrian.

00:56.238 --> 00:57.505
And now that you've gotten
to know me a little better,

00:57.539 --> 00:58.473
you still want to be a part of my life?

00:58.507 --> 00:59.240
I know I wouldn't.

01:02.144 --> 01:03.411
It's summer school, it
doesn't really count, does it?

01:03.445 --> 01:06.414
Yeah, as a matter of fact it does,

01:06.448 --> 01:09.117
and since you're not
usually a "C" student,

01:09.151 --> 01:12.120
I would encourage you to bring up your
grades in the next couple of weeks.

01:12.154 --> 01:14.222
Otherwise instead of summer school
helping you to get into college,

01:14.256 --> 01:16.224
it's actually going to hurt you,

01:16.258 --> 01:19.260
especially if you want to get
into the same school as Ricky.

01:19.295 --> 01:21.396
If you're going to do that, then
you'll probably need straight A's.

01:21.430 --> 01:24.265
Not C's. And certainly not a D,

01:24.300 --> 01:25.366
which is where you may be headed.

01:25.401 --> 01:27.335
Can't I just drop the courses,

01:27.369 --> 01:29.437
drop out of summer school and then
take the classes over in the fall?

01:29.471 --> 01:33.141
No. If you do that, they'll
end up averaging your grades

01:33.175 --> 01:34.142
so there's no way for you to make an A.

01:34.176 --> 01:35.443
And probably not a B.

01:35.477 --> 01:39.247
You'd get a failing
grade for summer school,

01:39.281 --> 01:42.283
and even if you got an A during
the year, you'd end up with a C.

01:42.318 --> 01:45.253
So Amy, I know you're
not happy to be here,

01:45.287 --> 01:48.256
but you are here, and
you signed up to be here,

01:48.290 --> 01:50.191
and you really need to
make school a priority.

01:50.559 --> 01:52.393
You've done it before.

01:52.428 --> 01:54.329
You came back from having
the baby and caught up.

01:54.363 --> 01:56.264
I know you can do it. I just...

01:56.298 --> 01:58.232
I don't want to do it. It's
summer, remember summer?

01:58.267 --> 02:01.302
When kids get a break from
school and they go out and play?

02:01.337 --> 02:03.137
Not kids in summer school.

02:03.172 --> 02:04.439
At least not until they
finish their homework.

02:07.209 --> 02:11.145
If you focus and work hard in the
next few weeks then you've got it.

02:11.180 --> 02:12.246
You'll have two classes out of the way.

02:12.281 --> 02:15.116
Two big classes that'll free you up

02:15.150 --> 02:16.217
for all of your easier
classes all next year.

02:18.253 --> 02:19.387
So, this is what I want you to do.

02:19.421 --> 02:22.190
I want you to stay in the office and

02:22.224 --> 02:23.391
finish up a couple of assignments

02:23.425 --> 02:26.260
that you keep asking for extensions on,

02:26.295 --> 02:30.131
and then you can go back to
class when you're all caught up.

02:30.165 --> 02:33.101
Make yourself at home. I'll be
in and out to check in on you.

02:33.135 --> 02:36.337
I have a lot of
parent/student/principal meetings today.

02:36.372 --> 02:38.206
Or I could just go to the library.

02:38.240 --> 02:40.274
No, you may get distracted there.

02:40.309 --> 02:41.342
Okay, look, here's the thing...

02:46.348 --> 02:47.348
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

02:52.287 --> 02:54.455
Is Amy home? Who's asking?

02:54.490 --> 02:56.190
Are you Ricky?

02:56.225 --> 02:58.126
I might be. Who are you?

02:58.160 --> 02:59.327
We're Amy's friends from New York.

02:59.361 --> 03:01.162
Not from New York. We met in New York.

03:01.196 --> 03:04.265
You know, at the program for teen moms.

03:04.299 --> 03:05.400
We're teen moms, too.

03:05.434 --> 03:08.102
Obviously.

03:08.137 --> 03:10.104
Amy said that we should drop
by if we're ever in the area.

03:10.139 --> 03:12.440
And we're in the area.

03:12.474 --> 03:14.142
We drove all the way from
Chicago with our two little guys.

03:17.212 --> 03:20.114
Oh. Well, Amy's at school
and I've got to get to work.

03:20.149 --> 03:21.349
I'll tell her you came by.

03:21.383 --> 03:22.083
But I didn't get your names.

03:22.117 --> 03:23.184
Jane. Jackie.

03:23.218 --> 03:24.252
Got it. Nice meeting you.

03:27.423 --> 03:29.457
Um. We're traveling with our children,

03:29.491 --> 03:32.427
kind of just staying
with friends, you know?

03:32.461 --> 03:35.129
We were hoping we could crash here.

03:35.164 --> 03:37.131
I think Amy said we could crash with her

03:37.166 --> 03:38.466
if we ever came out to California.

03:38.500 --> 03:41.235
Crash here? Oh, we
only have one bedroom.

03:41.270 --> 03:43.471
Maybe Amy told you that when she
was living at her parents' house.

03:43.505 --> 03:46.240
There's lots more room
at her parents' house.

03:46.275 --> 03:48.276
Does she have your number? I
could tell her to give you a call.

03:48.310 --> 03:49.310
Can we just come in?

03:49.344 --> 03:51.245
I have to use the bathroom.

03:51.280 --> 03:52.346
Me, too.

03:59.188 --> 04:01.055
No, Amy, you really can't drop out.

04:01.090 --> 04:02.423
No, I can.

04:02.458 --> 04:03.157
I'll just take whatever the
grade is when it's averaged.

04:03.192 --> 04:05.226
I really don't care anymore.

04:05.260 --> 04:05.660
It's too late in the
summer to start caring.

04:05.694 --> 04:08.129
No, it's not!

04:08.163 --> 04:09.197
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

04:14.069 --> 04:16.337
Oh. Sorry. Ricky doesn't usually
call unless there's a problem.

04:19.341 --> 04:22.310
Hello? Do you know two girls
named Jane and Jackie that you...

04:22.344 --> 04:25.046
Oh, my God! Wait, are they
there? Did they actually come?

04:25.080 --> 04:27.115
You invited them? No,
I didn't invite them,

04:27.149 --> 04:29.350
but I said that if they ever came out
to California, they should look us up.

04:29.384 --> 04:31.319
Well, they did.

04:31.353 --> 04:33.154
I can't believe it! I'm so excited
to see them. Let me talk to them.

04:34.156 --> 04:34.188
I'll just be one second.

04:37.192 --> 04:40.361
I came downstairs so I could
talk to you without an audience.

04:40.395 --> 04:42.363
They're upstairs, and they
each have a kid with them,

04:42.397 --> 04:44.432
and they think you invited
them to stay with us.

04:44.466 --> 04:46.200
I said they could crash
for a few nights. So what?

04:46.235 --> 04:48.169
Why can't they stay with us?

04:48.203 --> 04:49.270
Stay with us where?

04:49.304 --> 04:50.438
We're in the living room
and John's in the bedroom.

04:50.472 --> 04:53.174
Well, their boys can stay
in the bedroom with John

04:53.208 --> 04:55.209
and then they can sleep on the
living room floor. It'll be fine.

04:55.244 --> 04:59.113
No, it won't! I wouldn't be
comfortable with that arrangement.

04:59.148 --> 05:00.348
Then go over to my dad's house.

05:00.382 --> 05:02.049
Why don't you and your friends
go over to your dad's house?

05:02.084 --> 05:05.219
Because my dad would be around
and we want to, you know.

05:05.254 --> 05:06.187
No, I don't know.

05:08.357 --> 05:11.058
Look, we're going to
want to stay up late

05:11.093 --> 05:14.061
after John and their kids
go to bed so we can catch up,

05:14.096 --> 05:16.164
and I don't have to worry about
my dad listening to everything,

05:16.198 --> 05:17.331
or you, for that matter.

05:17.366 --> 05:19.267
So, just go over to my dad's house.

05:19.301 --> 05:21.202
No. And they can't stay
in the apartment with us.

05:21.236 --> 05:23.171
They don't have any money for hotels.

05:23.205 --> 05:25.206
Geez, it would just be
for a couple of nights.

05:25.240 --> 05:27.208
Look, I want to see my friends.

05:27.242 --> 05:28.409
And you're always saying
it's my apartment, too.

05:28.443 --> 05:30.144
So see them, then get rid of them

05:30.179 --> 05:32.246
because I don't want to do this.

05:32.281 --> 05:34.415
And it's not my place or
your place, it's our place.

05:34.449 --> 05:36.450
And you should have
discussed this with me.

05:39.421 --> 05:41.255
Okay.

05:41.290 --> 05:43.357
Well, I'm sure you realize
that you don't have time

05:43.392 --> 05:46.227
to be entertaining out
of town guests right now.

05:46.261 --> 05:49.130
Remember what we were
talking about earlier?

05:49.164 --> 05:50.498
Priorities.

05:50.532 --> 05:52.300
I thought we were talking about
my last summer in high school.

I don't know what you're talking about.

06:26.116 --> 06:27.850
Oh, you do too.

06:27.884 --> 06:28.650
And if you didn't have a new girlfriend,

06:28.685 --> 06:29.585
you'd already be talking to Henry

06:29.619 --> 06:31.954
because you don't
have any other friends.

06:31.988 --> 06:34.123
Oh, unless are friends now.

06:34.157 --> 06:37.159
You had over pizzasation with her

06:37.193 --> 06:38.861
and now Amy's your best friend?

06:38.895 --> 06:41.063
Not my best friend,
we had a conversation.

06:41.097 --> 06:42.865
It's the first time
between us. felt normal

06:42.899 --> 06:45.968
was nice. Nice, huh?

06:46.002 --> 06:46.935
Yeah, Dylan is not going to go for that,

06:46.970 --> 06:48.837
you and Amy being friends.

06:48.872 --> 06:51.140
Dylan doesn't get to decide
just who her friends are.

06:51.174 --> 06:53.842
Like me?

06:53.877 --> 06:55.944
She's a smart girl. No,
she's an annoying girl.

06:55.979 --> 06:57.813
And I think she's a little weird. Why?

06:57.847 --> 06:58.947
Uh, you're her first boyfriend

06:58.982 --> 07:00.816
and she's already so obsessed with you

07:00.850 --> 07:01.884
that she's showing up
at your ex-wife's condo.

07:01.918 --> 07:04.953
Oh. Mmm. Second ex-wife.

07:04.988 --> 07:06.121
I think that's how she refers to me.

07:06.156 --> 07:07.789
Yeah, she's funny.

07:07.824 --> 07:08.924
She calls Amy my first ex-wife

07:08.958 --> 07:10.926
even though we were never married.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.094
No, you weren't. Dylan likes me.

07:12.128 --> 07:12.161
She really likes me.

07:13.863 --> 07:15.998
And I like her.

07:16.032 --> 07:17.799
And I like that she likes you and Amy.

07:17.834 --> 07:19.001
I don't buy that.

07:19.035 --> 07:20.135
And I predict that Dylan's
going to get you in worse trouble

07:20.170 --> 07:22.771
than I got you into.

07:22.805 --> 07:23.939
And what kind of trouble would that be?

07:23.973 --> 07:25.974
God only knows, Benny.

07:26.009 --> 07:27.176
But I can't take care of you anymore.

07:27.977 --> 07:29.978
You really need Henry, you know that?

07:30.013 --> 07:33.982
You need your best friend to keep an
eye on you and be your voice of reason.

07:34.017 --> 07:35.851
So get over it,

07:35.885 --> 07:36.985
and make up with your best
friend before it's too late.

07:38.988 --> 07:41.924
I'm Ben's best friend. get over it?ld he

07:41.958 --> 07:43.091
Henry slept with his...

07:43.126 --> 07:44.927
Oh, that's right, you know this.

07:51.067 --> 07:52.801
(SIGHS)

07:52.835 --> 07:54.970
Haven't heard from you. How's it going?

07:55.004 --> 07:56.104
It's going okay.

07:56.139 --> 07:56.939
How's the new girlfriend? Good.

07:59.976 --> 08:02.744
How is it that Henry sleeps with Adrian

08:02.779 --> 08:03.946
and you end up not
being friends with me?

08:03.980 --> 08:05.781
Alice, we're friends,

08:05.815 --> 08:08.083
but Dylan is jealous
enough of Adrian and Amy

08:08.117 --> 08:10.118
without adding yet
another woman into my life.

08:10.153 --> 08:11.787
Adding?

08:13.089 --> 08:15.023
I've been here the whole time.

08:15.058 --> 08:16.858
Dylan would have a problem
with your hanging out with me?

08:16.893 --> 08:18.126
I don't know, but I imagine she might.

08:18.161 --> 08:20.028
And based on that, on your imagination,

08:20.063 --> 08:22.864
you've just quit
calling me or texting me,

08:22.899 --> 08:24.032
you have nothing to say to me?

08:24.067 --> 08:26.902
Ben, we're friends. We've
been friends for a long time.

08:26.936 --> 08:29.805
Alice, it was always
you and me and Henry.

08:31.107 --> 08:36.078
And I know Henry's the one who
screwed up and not you, but...

08:36.111 --> 08:39.914
I'm sorry, it just doesn't
seem right with just you and me.

08:40.149 --> 08:42.116
Okay.

08:54.197 --> 08:55.964
I told you to study.

08:55.999 --> 08:58.133
I told you to come
over and I'd help you.

08:58.167 --> 09:00.869
When was I going to go over
there? After I put John to bed?

09:00.903 --> 09:02.904
Or last weekend, you could
have come over last weekend.

09:02.939 --> 09:04.806
Last weekend was too late.

09:04.841 --> 09:06.742
And I can't pull my grades up,

09:06.776 --> 09:07.809
especially now that
showed up with their kids.

09:07.844 --> 09:10.879
What am I going to do?
get out and do stuff. to

09:10.913 --> 09:12.881
Okay. So, let them go out and do stuff,

09:12.915 --> 09:13.982
but you can't go with them.

09:14.017 --> 09:16.084
You have to study, you have to.

09:16.119 --> 09:17.753
And Ricky's right, in
your apartment.r them

09:17.787 --> 09:19.921
We could make room.

09:19.956 --> 09:21.823
I've never spent the night
over at your apartment.

09:21.858 --> 09:23.025
Well, you could if you wanted to.

09:25.094 --> 09:26.128
They drove with their sons. Chicago

09:26.162 --> 09:28.764
They're my friends.

09:28.798 --> 09:29.998
You don't have time for more friends.

09:30.033 --> 09:31.033
You don't even have time for me.

09:31.067 --> 09:33.001
You're not a good friend to me.

09:33.036 --> 09:35.037
You're not even to yourself.d

09:35.071 --> 09:37.105
You're going to summer school.

09:37.140 --> 09:39.074
How embarrassing is that going to be?

09:39.108 --> 09:41.843
You really have to summer school.

09:41.878 --> 09:43.845
You know what? what it's like. Okay?

09:43.880 --> 09:45.881
You have it easy. no responsibilities.

09:45.915 --> 09:47.883
Your mom still does or your dad.or you,

09:47.917 --> 09:50.852
All you have to do is study.

09:50.887 --> 09:52.120
I resent that. than just study.

09:54.190 --> 09:54.856
I...

09:56.993 --> 09:57.893
I hand washed a blouse last week.

09:57.927 --> 10:00.929
(SCOFFS) Oh, please, Lauren.

10:00.963 --> 10:03.865
You have nothing to do
and do your homework.

10:03.900 --> 10:05.100
That is such a luxury.

10:05.134 --> 10:06.935
It's more like a choice.

10:06.969 --> 10:07.936
Oh, I see.

10:09.072 --> 10:10.005
It's a choice.

10:10.206 --> 10:12.908
And I chose badly.

10:12.942 --> 10:15.110
As in I chose to have
a baby in high school.

10:15.144 --> 10:16.812
You said it. No, you said it.

10:16.846 --> 10:18.013
All right, I said it.

10:18.047 --> 10:20.115
You don't make good
choices for yourself.

10:20.149 --> 10:22.050
Why are you trying to
be friends with Ben again

10:22.085 --> 10:23.919
when you got what you wanted?

10:23.953 --> 10:26.888
You're living with Ricky,
you're engaged to Ricky.

10:26.923 --> 10:28.123
Did you even tell Ricky that
you spent an hour talking to Ben

10:28.157 --> 10:30.058
when you went to get pizza?

10:30.093 --> 10:31.059
No. He didn't ask.

10:32.962 --> 10:34.162
What?

10:34.197 --> 10:35.831
It was a choice.

10:35.865 --> 10:37.132
Another bad choice.

10:45.074 --> 10:45.974
Hi.

10:48.144 --> 10:50.078
Hi.

10:51.214 --> 10:54.149
Hey, you want to go off
campus for lunch today?

10:54.183 --> 10:55.917
Lauren just spoke to me.

10:55.952 --> 10:57.119
I was standing right here.

10:57.153 --> 10:58.954
I was about to head right down there

10:58.988 --> 11:00.822
and she looked at me,
and she kept walking,

11:00.857 --> 11:03.959
but she said, "Hi," and she didn't
turn around, she kept walking,

11:03.993 --> 11:05.093
so I called back, "Hi."

11:05.128 --> 11:08.830
And she didn't tell me
to shut up or anything.

11:08.865 --> 11:09.998
She actually spoke to me.

11:10.032 --> 11:11.800
So, you want to go off
campus for lunch or not?

11:11.834 --> 11:13.869
This is huge.

11:13.903 --> 11:15.971
This means she is on the
verge of being my friend again.

11:16.005 --> 11:17.939
I knew she'd get sick of Amy.

11:17.974 --> 11:19.141
Amy and Ricky, Ricky and Amy.

11:19.175 --> 11:21.042
Yeah. I'm starving.

11:21.077 --> 11:22.978
Maybe you should try
to talk to Ben again.

11:23.012 --> 11:24.112
Maybe this is the day that
we both get our friends back.

11:24.147 --> 11:26.181
I don't know if I want my friend back.

11:26.215 --> 11:29.117
(SIGHS) I can't afford
to want my friend back.

11:29.152 --> 11:31.086
It's too painful and too frustrating.

11:31.120 --> 11:33.054
And I got to tell you, Madison,
if you make up with Lauren,

11:33.089 --> 11:35.023
I'm going to be lost, I have no one.

11:35.057 --> 11:37.192
That's what they call karma, my friend.

11:37.226 --> 11:41.163
I mean ex-friend. I
mean ex-best friend.

11:41.197 --> 11:43.999
But somehow your karma seems
to be stinking up my life.

11:46.869 --> 11:48.870
Okay. Don't listen to her.

11:48.905 --> 11:50.238
You deserve way better
than Ben as a friend.

11:51.874 --> 11:52.874
Even better than me.

11:52.909 --> 11:54.009
Oh, no, Madison, don't.

11:54.043 --> 11:55.143
You know what? I'll call you.

11:55.178 --> 11:57.913
We'll have lunch another time.

11:57.947 --> 12:00.816
Oh, no.

12:30.847 --> 12:32.981
Hi. Hi.

12:40.156 --> 12:42.190
Hi.

12:42.225 --> 12:44.159
Lauren just spoke to me
so I thought I'd see if

12:44.193 --> 12:46.194
maybe you wanted to speak to me.

12:46.229 --> 12:48.930
I speak to you all the time, I just
don't want to be friends with you, okay?

12:48.965 --> 12:50.131
Okay.

12:50.166 --> 12:52.000
So, what are you doing in here?

12:52.034 --> 12:54.135
Something I would only
discuss with a friend.

12:54.170 --> 12:57.939
Okay, well, I'd love to hear
about it if you want to talk.

12:59.108 --> 13:01.943
I really, really would like
us all to be friends again.

13:03.913 --> 13:05.514
No groveling, okay?

13:05.548 --> 13:07.782
A stupid fight with Amy and Lauren is
not worth losing your self-respect over.

13:07.817 --> 13:11.152
I've already lost my self-respect
with that stupid guy Jesse.

13:11.187 --> 13:13.955
I mean, why would I have sex with
somebody I don't even care about?

13:13.990 --> 13:15.857
Why are you asking me? I don't do that.

13:16.158 --> 13:18.093
Anymore.

13:19.829 --> 13:22.063
Well, I've apologized,
like a thousand times,

13:22.098 --> 13:24.132
but there's no excuse.

13:24.166 --> 13:27.068
At lfast no excuse that
anyone's gonna understand.

13:27.103 --> 13:28.203
I'm going to try to find Lauren.

13:37.113 --> 13:37.946
Hi.

13:37.980 --> 13:40.815
Hi. What's going on?

13:40.850 --> 13:41.550
I don't want to talk about it.

13:41.584 --> 13:43.084
Maybe you'd like to talk to Ben.

13:43.119 --> 13:44.953
I know you and Ben are talking.

13:44.987 --> 13:46.821
We bumped into each other, so what?

13:46.856 --> 13:48.023
So it took him an hour
to get back with the pizza

13:48.057 --> 13:50.058
and I was stuck talking
to the new girlfriend.

13:50.092 --> 13:51.860
So, no, you didn't just bump into him.

13:51.894 --> 13:52.794
And I suppose now you're going to start

13:52.828 --> 13:54.129
talking to Ricky again
to get back at me?

13:54.163 --> 13:55.964
No.

13:55.998 --> 13:59.134
You know, strangely
enough, I'm happy with Omar,

13:59.168 --> 14:01.136
and Ricky is happy with you.

14:01.170 --> 14:02.804
We're both happy being
away from each other

14:02.838 --> 14:04.039
and with other people.

14:04.073 --> 14:06.841
No, you and Ben are the wild cards now.

14:06.876 --> 14:08.109
I'm very happy with Ricky.

14:08.144 --> 14:09.144
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

14:13.916 --> 14:15.750
Hello? Did you call them?

14:15.785 --> 14:16.985
They're still up there.

14:17.019 --> 14:19.054
I am not going to call
my friends until...

14:19.088 --> 14:20.956
Do you mind? This is
a private conversation.

14:27.997 --> 14:30.131
Look, I don't want them to feel like
they aren't welcome in our apartment.

14:30.166 --> 14:31.766
I'll just talk to them when I get home.

14:31.801 --> 14:33.802
At 6:00 or 7:00 tonight?

14:33.836 --> 14:35.103
I just want to see them for one night!

14:38.107 --> 14:40.809
Wild card.

Hi, Amy. Hi, Amy.

14:49.085 --> 14:50.018
Hi, Grace.

14:50.886 --> 14:52.187
Hi, Amy.

14:52.221 --> 14:54.956
I was looking for Ethan. Do
you know where I might find him?

14:54.991 --> 14:56.858
Yeah, I know where you might find him,

14:56.892 --> 14:59.995
but if I were you, I would go
make friends with someone else.

15:00.029 --> 15:01.963
Okay, what's the matter?

15:01.998 --> 15:03.765
You don't like Jacob?

15:03.799 --> 15:05.033
He's not good enough for Ethan?

15:05.067 --> 15:07.902
He's my brother, you know.

15:07.937 --> 15:09.771
Okay. Ethan's in the band room.

15:09.805 --> 15:10.839
Oh. I hadn't thought of looking there.

15:11.073 --> 15:13.008
Thanks.

15:17.913 --> 15:18.980
So he's your brother now?

15:19.015 --> 15:20.849
Yeah!

15:20.883 --> 15:22.884
All right.

15:22.918 --> 15:25.754
You know, my mom is having
dinner with your father tonight,

15:25.788 --> 15:26.921
so maybe you were right.

15:26.956 --> 15:29.090
You told me that your mom was married

15:29.125 --> 15:31.893
and that she would never
leave her husband for my dad.

15:31.927 --> 15:33.895
You also told me that that
guy was not your brother.

15:33.929 --> 15:34.829
So make up your mind.

15:44.526 --> 15:44.526
+

15:59.564 --> 16:01.398
I got to catch that kid.

16:01.432 --> 16:02.332
Come here, kid.

16:05.270 --> 16:06.503
And whose kid is this?

16:06.538 --> 16:09.406
Two of Amy's friends dropped
by, they both have children.

16:09.440 --> 16:11.208
I guess one of them escaped.

16:11.242 --> 16:13.343
You have house guests?
Four house guests?

16:13.378 --> 16:15.445
I hope not.

16:15.480 --> 16:16.246
I hope Amy's going to come home
after work and get rid of them.

16:16.281 --> 16:18.448
Here. I'll take him upstairs.

16:19.484 --> 16:20.551
Let's go.

16:33.364 --> 16:36.433
Amy is so lucky.

16:36.467 --> 16:39.436
I mean, look at this
place, it's great, isn't it?

16:39.470 --> 16:41.371
I would die to live
in a place like this.

16:41.406 --> 16:42.439
And hey, that Ricky...

16:42.473 --> 16:43.373
Oh, I know.

16:43.408 --> 16:46.443
My boyfriend is such a dork.

16:46.477 --> 16:48.478
I can't even believe
I had sex with him now.

16:48.513 --> 16:49.479
And more than once.

16:50.582 --> 16:54.451
I found someone down
in the butcher shop.

16:54.485 --> 16:56.486
I didn't realize he was
up from his nap. Sorry.

16:56.521 --> 16:58.155
He came l the way down the stairs

16:58.189 --> 17:00.223
and was just wandering
around the butcher shop

17:00.258 --> 17:02.426
where there are knives
and meat cutters, and...

17:02.460 --> 17:04.461
It's not a place for children.

17:04.494 --> 17:06.630
We don't let John just wander
around the butcher shop.

17:06.664 --> 17:08.632
We were just talking
about how cute you are.

17:10.335 --> 17:11.335
See ya.

17:15.506 --> 17:19.409
David, you just got
Mommy in big trouble.

17:19.444 --> 17:21.310
Don't go outside the apartment again.

17:21.346 --> 17:22.412
Now go over there and play with Allen.

17:22.446 --> 17:24.548
Think he understands that?

17:24.582 --> 17:26.617
No. It was more for me than him.

17:26.651 --> 17:28.652
This is so not a vacation.

17:28.686 --> 17:30.520
Maybe we should go to
the beach or something.

17:30.555 --> 17:32.623
I just want to do nothing
for a couple of days.

17:32.657 --> 17:34.324
I'm tired of driving.

17:34.359 --> 17:37.394
I'm tired of being a
mom. I'm no good at it.

17:37.428 --> 17:39.429
We should have sent the boys
on a vacation with their dads

17:39.464 --> 17:40.597
and just stayed home.

17:40.632 --> 17:41.531
Yeah, right. Yeah, right.

17:41.566 --> 17:43.600
Seriously. I would be a much better mom

17:43.635 --> 17:46.370
if I just had some
time to take care of me.

17:46.671 --> 17:47.704
Yeah.

17:50.575 --> 17:52.576
Ricky, you really need
to stop calling me.

17:52.610 --> 17:54.544
One of them wasn't watching her kid

17:54.579 --> 17:57.547
and he came down here and he was
wandering around all over the place.

17:57.582 --> 17:58.548
Jackie. Probably Jackie.

17:58.583 --> 18:01.551
Amy, I can't take care of your friends

18:01.586 --> 18:04.254
and watch their children and work.

18:04.288 --> 18:06.390
And even if I wasn't working, I don't
want to watch someone else's kids.

earlier, did he find you?

Jacob?

18:47.498 --> 18:47.798
Yeah. You know Jacob, Grace's brother?

finish this, all right?

wants to go out with me?

19:37.682 --> 19:39.483
All right, hurry up, dude,
we both have to get to class.

19:39.517 --> 19:40.517
Did you find out if we
can use Ricky's apartment?

19:40.551 --> 19:42.319
That was never going to work.

19:42.353 --> 19:43.487
Even if he and Amy let us use the place,

19:43.521 --> 19:45.489
it's got baby stuff all over it.

19:45.523 --> 19:46.623
We're never going to get
anywhere with two chicks

19:46.657 --> 19:48.525
if there's baby stuff
laying all over the place.

19:48.559 --> 19:50.560
But your guest house
is freend clear, right?

19:50.595 --> 19:52.329
(CAMERA CLICKS)

19:52.363 --> 19:54.464
No. No, my eyes were closed.

19:54.499 --> 19:57.367
And we cannot use the guest house.

19:57.401 --> 20:00.270
I'm already in enough trouble with my...

20:00.304 --> 20:02.639
I don't know what to
call her, my dad's wife?

20:02.673 --> 20:05.442
Try to get a decent
photo this time, will you?

20:05.476 --> 20:07.511
I'm not taking another one.
This is what you look like.

20:07.545 --> 20:09.579
I'll tell them to meet us at
your guest house at what, 9:00?

20:09.614 --> 20:12.382
9:00? No. That's too late.

20:12.416 --> 20:16.286
It's a school night and I don't think
Kathleen will be out that late with George.

20:16.320 --> 20:17.454
She's old.

20:17.488 --> 20:18.488
Well, these chicks aren't.
They're 17, it's summer.

20:18.523 --> 20:22.292
They're not going out
before sundown, come on.

20:22.326 --> 20:24.361
The later it is, the less
chance we have of getting caught.

20:24.395 --> 20:25.495
I'll get back to you.

20:31.502 --> 20:34.671
(CHUCKLES) That was hilarious.

20:34.705 --> 20:36.540
I don't know if that's a compliment.

20:36.574 --> 20:39.309
Oh, it wasn't sex so don't be insulted.

20:39.343 --> 20:41.344
It was foreplay. It was making out.

20:41.379 --> 20:44.414
And I'm sorry, two adults sneaking
around to make out is hilarious.

20:44.448 --> 20:47.417
Or genius. Or genius.

20:47.451 --> 20:49.486
Now I wish I hadn't even
told Grace we were going out.

20:49.520 --> 20:50.587
She would never have known.

20:50.621 --> 20:50.687
Oh, well...

20:53.558 --> 20:55.659
Thanks for lunch. And for...

20:57.328 --> 20:58.094
Making out.

20:58.129 --> 20:59.462
You told Grace we were going out?

20:59.497 --> 21:00.430
I just thought I would meion it to her

21:00.464 --> 21:02.232
that we were having dinner, as friends.

21:02.266 --> 21:04.334
That way, if we got caught,
we wouldn't look suspicious.

21:04.368 --> 21:08.371
Yeah, all right. However
you want to play it.

21:08.406 --> 21:09.506
It's all up to you, Kat.

21:11.609 --> 21:13.276
I like it when you call me that.

21:20.618 --> 21:22.385
Goodbye.

21:22.420 --> 21:24.521
Thanks for lunch.

21:24.555 --> 21:25.322
We could still go out for dinner.

21:25.356 --> 21:28.458
No, it wouldn't beat lunch.

21:28.492 --> 21:29.559
That was fun.

21:30.628 --> 21:32.295
Goodbye.

21:32.330 --> 21:33.396
Bye.

21:33.431 --> 21:34.364
Bye.

21:35.299 --> 21:36.399
Bye.

21:36.434 --> 21:38.737
(LAUGHING) Bye.

21:47.678 --> 21:49.446
(BABY CRYING ON MONITOR)

21:53.862 --> 21:53.862
+

22:00.829 --> 22:02.096
What? Is he down there again?

22:02.130 --> 22:04.798
Geez, I can't keep up with that kid.

22:04.833 --> 22:06.066
I bet you could if you tried.

22:06.101 --> 22:06.867
He's right there.

22:08.136 --> 22:11.805
Oh. Yeah. He is.

22:11.840 --> 22:13.040
You really should keep
an eye on your sons.

22:13.074 --> 22:14.007
Does someone actually
have to tell you that?

22:14.042 --> 22:16.877
Look. We don't have
boyfriends or fiances

22:16.911 --> 22:18.078
or Prince Charmings, all right?

22:18.113 --> 22:20.047
It's just us and the deadbeat dads.

22:20.081 --> 22:21.849
And we're tired.

22:21.883 --> 22:23.384
And what time does Amy get
home? We want to go out.

22:23.418 --> 22:26.887
Yeah, this place is nice and all but
it's all we've seen of California.

22:26.921 --> 22:28.789
We want to go out.

22:28.823 --> 22:31.859
Amy won't be home for hours
and then she has to do homework.

22:31.893 --> 22:33.794
So if you two want to go somewhere,

22:33.828 --> 22:35.062
I can keep an eye on the little guys.

22:35.096 --> 22:36.830
Okay. Okay.

22:36.865 --> 22:38.065
Oh. Wait a minute. We
don't really know you.

22:38.099 --> 22:40.000
He's fine.

22:40.034 --> 22:41.068
I'm sure Amy will give me
a good reference, call her.

22:41.102 --> 22:43.036
No, that's okay. We'll be back.

22:43.071 --> 22:44.905
Yeah. What time were you thinking?

22:44.939 --> 22:45.939
Just leave me your cell numbers
in case I have any trouble

22:45.974 --> 22:48.909
when it's time for them to go to bed.

22:48.943 --> 22:50.844
Really? Really?

22:50.879 --> 22:51.945
Oh. He has no trouble sleeping anywhere.

22:51.980 --> 22:53.981
He's used to staying with
my mom, or my friends,

22:54.015 --> 22:55.048
or other family members.

22:55.083 --> 22:56.784
Yeah, Allen, too. Bye.

22:56.818 --> 22:57.851
Cell numbers.

23:03.057 --> 23:05.092
(BELL RINGING)

23:09.964 --> 23:11.732
So, let's go by the market
and get a pile of snacks,

23:11.766 --> 23:14.034
and then start working on the
final paper for world history.

23:14.068 --> 23:17.805
Oh, I can't believe I'm almost
finished with high school.

23:17.839 --> 23:19.907
That's not due for weeks.
I'm gonna go over to Jack's.

23:19.941 --> 23:21.975
No, let's just get the
bibliographies done.

23:22.010 --> 23:23.977
I really want to get started on this.

23:24.012 --> 23:26.046
I mean, I can finally see the
light at the end of the tunnel.

23:26.080 --> 23:28.982
Well, I'd like to see
it after I see Jack.

23:29.017 --> 23:31.051
Okay. Let me ask you something.

23:31.085 --> 23:33.921
If you like Jack so much, why is
it that you're holding out on him?

23:33.955 --> 23:36.790
We made out. And how long you
think he'll be happy with that?

23:36.825 --> 23:37.825
As long as I'm happy with that.

23:37.859 --> 23:39.126
Mmm-hmm.

23:39.160 --> 23:40.928
Yeah. I think you're holding out on him

23:40.962 --> 23:42.863
just in case Daniel comes back around.

23:42.897 --> 23:44.164
Daniel? Who said anything about Daniel?

23:45.934 --> 23:47.134
Look...

23:47.168 --> 23:48.836
I'm not going to have sex with Jack

23:48.870 --> 23:50.971
if there's even the slightest chance

23:51.005 --> 23:53.841
I'm ever gonna want to have sex
with Daniel or any other guy.

23:53.875 --> 23:55.142
My numbers are getting too high.

23:55.176 --> 23:56.944
I'm stopping at three.

23:56.978 --> 23:59.713
You'd still be at three if
you slept with Jack right now.

23:59.747 --> 24:00.881
Unless you're counting him twice.

24:00.915 --> 24:02.716
All right, all right.

24:02.750 --> 24:05.919
The real reason is, if I
get back in bed with Jack,

24:05.954 --> 24:08.088
that's it, for life.

24:08.122 --> 24:11.859
And if you get back in bed
with Daniel, that's it for life?

24:11.893 --> 24:13.060
Daniel would never make
that kind of commitment.

24:13.094 --> 24:14.828
Oh, and you think Jack would?

24:14.863 --> 24:15.996
Yes. He would.

24:16.865 --> 24:18.866
I just don't know if I would.

24:18.900 --> 24:21.802
So I'm not going to have sex with him.

24:34.983 --> 24:35.949
Hi, Alice.

24:39.120 --> 24:41.154
I know you're not talking to me. But...

24:41.189 --> 24:43.156
I miss you.

24:45.026 --> 24:47.060
I miss you and Ben.

24:47.095 --> 24:50.030
I miss me and you and Ben hanging out.

24:50.064 --> 24:51.832
Really? Really.

24:51.866 --> 24:53.033
Can't we just be friends, Alice?

24:53.067 --> 24:53.901
I don't think so, Henry.

24:53.935 --> 24:56.770
Because I still love you

24:56.804 --> 24:57.971
and I still want to be your girlfriend.

24:58.006 --> 24:59.840
But Alice...

24:59.874 --> 25:01.942
I know this is cliche, but
don't you think we're too young

25:01.976 --> 25:05.979
to be making those decisions about who we
want to spend the rest of our lives with?

25:06.014 --> 25:09.816
No. Come on, Alice, give it up.

25:09.851 --> 25:11.084
You should be out there
dating and so should I.

25:11.119 --> 25:12.085
We have no life experience.

25:12.120 --> 25:14.888
You mean we're not whores? Yeah.

25:14.923 --> 25:16.823
I don't want to be a whore.

25:16.858 --> 25:17.891
I want to be your whore.

25:18.860 --> 25:20.961
I want you to be my friend.

25:20.995 --> 25:22.129
I can't.

25:22.163 --> 25:24.798
That's really selfish
of you, you know that?

25:24.832 --> 25:26.133
Because if you can be my friend,

25:26.167 --> 25:27.868
then maybe Ben could
be our friend again.

25:33.074 --> 25:35.075
(SIGHS)

25:41.082 --> 25:42.115
Hi.

25:43.084 --> 25:45.786
Hi.

25:45.820 --> 25:47.788
I'm so sorry. Thanks
for saying hi to me.

25:47.822 --> 25:48.822
Oh, Madison, you are such an idiot.

25:48.856 --> 25:51.959
I know, I know, I know.

25:51.993 --> 25:53.126
Why did you do it?

25:53.161 --> 25:55.896
I don't know. I felt sorry for him.

25:55.930 --> 25:56.997
You felt sorry for him?

25:57.031 --> 25:58.865
He knew you didn't like him.

25:58.900 --> 25:59.967
Just because I wouldn't
have sex with him?

26:00.001 --> 26:02.803
No, he just knew.

26:02.837 --> 26:05.739
And he used it to make
me feel sorry for him.

26:05.773 --> 26:07.975
And he just kept smiling
and telling me I was pretty,

26:08.009 --> 26:09.977
and he has such a beautiful smile,

26:10.011 --> 26:13.880
which only became annoying
after a while, by the way.

26:13.915 --> 26:15.983
I was just so attracted
to him, and he was so cute.

26:16.017 --> 26:18.085
But then he just kept smiling,
and smiling, and smiling.

26:18.119 --> 26:20.854
Believe me. I know.

26:20.888 --> 26:23.991
That same smile that attracted
me to him in the first place

26:24.025 --> 26:26.026
just eventually turned me off.

26:26.060 --> 26:27.894
Yeah. I should have just waited
until that happened to me.

26:30.932 --> 26:31.765
I mean, I never should have done it.

26:31.799 --> 26:33.867
No, you shouldn't have, but you did.

26:35.003 --> 26:36.870
I guess I should just get over it.

26:38.172 --> 26:39.873
I'm really going to try.

26:39.907 --> 26:40.941
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.

26:43.144 --> 26:44.144
Should we go tell Amy?

26:45.179 --> 26:46.780
(LAUGHING)

26:46.814 --> 26:47.581
No. No.

26:47.615 --> 26:49.149
I really need a break from Amy.

26:49.183 --> 26:51.051
Oh! I know what you mean.

26:51.085 --> 26:52.085
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

27:03.898 --> 27:04.965
Hi. Hi.

27:08.102 --> 27:09.803
Oh. Hi.

27:09.837 --> 27:10.937
So, what's going on?

27:10.972 --> 27:14.107
I got a little behind in my assignments.

27:14.142 --> 27:14.875
I guess I didn't make summer school

27:14.909 --> 27:17.010
as important as I should have.

27:17.045 --> 27:18.078
You, uh, want some help?

27:18.112 --> 27:20.947
No. No.

27:20.982 --> 27:22.816
And even if I did want help,
wouldn't that be a problem?

27:24.052 --> 27:25.118
With your girlfriend.

27:25.853 --> 27:28.889
Probably. But she'd get over it.

27:28.923 --> 27:31.792
Well, I don't need any help.

27:31.826 --> 27:33.060
I think I just need
to do this by myself.

27:33.094 --> 27:33.827
But, thanks. You're welcome.

27:35.930 --> 27:36.930
Excuse me.

27:36.964 --> 27:39.066
See ya. And good luck.

27:41.869 --> 27:44.905
So, how are you doing?

27:44.939 --> 27:48.075
Um, I have to admit, it was
nice to have a day to catch up,

27:48.109 --> 27:50.777
but I'm not quite caught up.

27:50.812 --> 27:52.145
Well, I'll stay as long
as you want to stay.

27:52.180 --> 27:53.980
I'd like to stay.

27:54.015 --> 27:55.115
I'd like to stay until
I got everything done.

27:55.149 --> 27:56.983
Even if that's until midnight.

27:57.018 --> 27:59.753
But the reality is, I have
a son, and I have a job.

27:59.787 --> 28:01.855
And I have to leave my
homework unfinished yet again

28:01.889 --> 28:03.757
because I have to go to my job,

28:03.791 --> 28:05.058
because not only do we need the
money, we need the insurance.

28:05.093 --> 28:06.893
So... All right, so
you have to go to work.

28:06.928 --> 28:09.830
Ricky can take over with
John when you get home.

28:09.864 --> 28:11.031
No, I already asked him to
take over with the house guests.

28:11.065 --> 28:13.900
And they went out, and he's babysitting.

28:13.935 --> 28:16.770
I can't leave my friends'
kids with him and not help him.

28:16.804 --> 28:17.971
And my friends are gonna
come back to the apartment.

28:18.005 --> 28:19.773
And I can't finish this.

28:19.807 --> 28:22.042
Look, I know I need to,
and I want to, but I can't.

28:22.076 --> 28:23.944
You can.

28:23.978 --> 28:25.045
You can do it. You can do
anything you want to do.

28:25.079 --> 28:26.113
How?

28:30.557 --> 28:30.557
+

28:33.352 --> 28:35.486
It's about time.

28:35.520 --> 28:36.554
Am I late? No.

28:36.588 --> 28:37.755
But your little friend left an hour ago

28:37.789 --> 28:39.690
to take care of sosome personal business

28:39.725 --> 28:40.691
and I got stuff that
needs to be done here.

28:40.726 --> 28:43.728
Thus the job.

28:43.762 --> 28:45.396
All right. All right?

28:45.430 --> 28:46.664
All right.

28:46.698 --> 28:49.467
What are you in such a good mood about?

28:49.501 --> 28:51.736
I don't know, just, uh, life is good.

28:51.770 --> 28:53.604
So, what do you need me to
do? Life is not that good.

28:53.639 --> 28:55.673
What's up? Nothing.

28:55.707 --> 28:58.409
I swear. Ricky had personal business?

28:58.443 --> 29:00.611
That's what I said.

29:00.646 --> 29:01.479
Amy's got some friends
in town. He's babysitting.

29:02.714 --> 29:03.781
What?

29:03.815 --> 29:08.619
Just grateful to...

29:08.654 --> 29:10.421
I don't know, have some
choices in my life again.

29:10.455 --> 29:13.791
What choices? Who to go out
with, who to be friends with.

29:13.825 --> 29:17.695
Uh-huh. I heard you're
not that free to be friends

29:17.729 --> 29:19.630
with either of your ex-wives.

29:19.665 --> 29:20.698
Wow. Word gets around.

29:20.732 --> 29:23.501
Yeah.

29:23.535 --> 29:24.568
Dylan may be jealous of Amy and Adrian,

29:24.603 --> 29:26.671
but Dylan was also smart enough

29:26.705 --> 29:29.473
to try to make friends
with Amy and Adrian.

29:29.508 --> 29:31.575
(SCOFFS) Friends, huh?

29:31.610 --> 29:33.477
Yeah. Which leaves me to be
friends with Amy and Adrian.

29:33.512 --> 29:36.647
No, it doesn't. You can't be
friends with either one of them.

29:36.682 --> 29:39.617
You and Dylan can be
friends with Amy and Adrian,

29:39.651 --> 29:41.519
but you can't, not just on your own.

29:41.553 --> 29:42.687
She's seen to that.

29:42.721 --> 29:44.588
And if she's friends with them,

29:44.623 --> 29:46.457
you don't have confidentiality
with either one of them.

29:46.491 --> 29:48.859
And that's why you need Alice and Henry.

29:48.894 --> 29:52.797
And you need Alice and Henry
to not be friends with Dylan.

29:52.831 --> 29:54.799
Oh, geezez, did my d
ask you to say that?

29:57.636 --> 29:58.869
It's the way of the world.

30:00.572 --> 30:01.305
All I need is Dylan.

30:01.340 --> 30:03.607
Here's the thing, noodle head.

30:03.642 --> 30:05.910
Surely you recognize
that Dylan's smart enough

30:05.944 --> 30:08.846
to keep her friends close
and her enemies closer.

30:08.880 --> 30:12.616
So, if you're thinking
that you're free now

30:12.651 --> 30:14.752
to be closer to either
one of her enemies,

30:14.786 --> 30:16.921
your ex-wives, you'd be wrong.

30:16.955 --> 30:19.724
You're just not feeling
the leash. It'll tighten up.

30:24.896 --> 30:28.699
And then Antonio said,
"But I'm the big brother,"

30:28.734 --> 30:31.602
and Harrison said, "But
I'm the little brother."

30:31.636 --> 30:35.539
And the daddy said, "The
point is, you're brothers."

30:36.541 --> 30:37.742
Can you be my daddy?

30:37.776 --> 30:39.643
You already have aaddy.

30:39.678 --> 30:41.812
But I'd love to be your friend,

30:41.847 --> 30:43.814
because I can't wait
for my son to meet you,

30:43.849 --> 30:46.550
because I know he's going to
want to be your friend, too.

30:46.585 --> 30:47.718
You're really a good
reader, you know that?

30:47.753 --> 30:49.754
You know lots of words already.

30:49.788 --> 30:51.722
And so do you.

30:51.757 --> 30:53.524
You must have really good mommies, huh?

30:53.558 --> 30:54.692
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

30:57.629 --> 30:58.763
Hey, Amy.

30:58.797 --> 31:00.664
Read more.

31:00.699 --> 31:02.700
Just a second.

31:02.734 --> 31:04.802
Your friends aren't going to be
back by the time you finish work.

31:04.836 --> 31:07.571
They may not be back
before the boys go to bed,

31:07.606 --> 31:10.775
which is fine, we're
getting along great.

31:10.809 --> 31:12.710
Uh, you'd have to drop John off.

31:12.744 --> 31:15.546
We don't have car seats for
these guys. What's going on?

31:15.580 --> 31:17.748
My mom's not having dinner
with George, they had lunch.

31:17.783 --> 31:20.851
She wants me to have dinner
with her and Tom and Jacob.

31:20.886 --> 31:23.654
You don't have to go
right now though, do you?

31:23.688 --> 31:25.723
No. I don't have to go right now.

31:32.831 --> 31:36.467
All right. Grace, look,
we should stop doing this

31:36.501 --> 31:39.570
unless we're going to do more than this.

31:39.604 --> 31:40.538
I don't think we should
do more than this.

31:40.572 --> 31:43.607
Then let's not do this at all.

31:43.642 --> 31:45.709
I'm fine with not doing this at all.

31:45.744 --> 31:47.545
I can't keep making out with you

31:47.579 --> 31:48.813
without wanting to have sex with you.

31:48.847 --> 31:50.614
I don't know what we're doing here.

31:50.649 --> 31:52.483
I don't want to have sex with you.

31:52.517 --> 31:53.884
Thanks.

31:53.919 --> 31:56.587
And do you mean you don't want
to have sex with me this afternoon

31:56.621 --> 31:57.855
and you might want to have sex with me

31:57.889 --> 32:00.791
at some point in the
not too distant future?

32:00.826 --> 32:02.760
No. I mean, I don't
want to have sex with you

32:02.794 --> 32:04.762
until there's some kind of commitment.

32:05.530 --> 32:08.499
A big commitment.

32:08.533 --> 32:11.669
Like we plan on getting married
in the future kind of commitment.

32:11.703 --> 32:13.737
All right, then let's just not make out.

32:13.772 --> 32:15.573
What? You don't seriously think

32:15.607 --> 32:18.843
I could make a commitment
to you for life right now?

32:18.877 --> 32:21.679
And you don't want to make
a commitment to me, do you?

32:21.713 --> 32:24.615
I mean, you're a senior in high
school, I'm about to start college.

32:24.649 --> 32:25.015
Who knows what's going
to happen in the future.

32:25.050 --> 32:28.586
Well, I know.

32:28.620 --> 32:30.054
I know I don't want to be with you
if you think about me like that.

32:30.088 --> 32:31.555
'Cause apparently you're the type
of guy who can't make a commitment.

32:31.590 --> 32:33.491
And you can? Yeah.

32:33.525 --> 32:34.725
Did you make a commitment
to Grant? Or to Daniel?

32:34.759 --> 32:37.595
No, but since Grant and Daniel,

32:37.629 --> 32:39.697
I have learned in order to
enjoy sex, I need a commitment.

32:39.731 --> 32:42.733
I don't want to end up like Jacob's mom.

32:42.767 --> 32:44.001
Seeing you once a year
while I raise a kid alone

32:44.035 --> 32:46.604
and then you find some other
woman and have children with her.

32:47.572 --> 32:48.539
What? Yeah.

32:48.573 --> 32:50.641
Either you tell me that
when you and I have sex,

32:50.675 --> 32:52.776
from that point on, we don't
have sex with anyone else

32:52.811 --> 32:55.713
and we're going to be
married, or we don't have sex.

32:55.747 --> 32:58.582
All right, well, let me think
about it. And I'll get back to you.

33:02.821 --> 33:06.724
I forgot. We're at my house, in my room.

33:06.758 --> 33:08.659
But I thought about it, and Grace,

33:08.693 --> 33:09.827
I can't make that kind of commitment.

33:20.839 --> 33:22.907
All right, I can study now.

33:23.909 --> 33:24.742
All right.

33:24.776 --> 33:27.611
Mind if I take a nap while you study?

33:28.847 --> 33:30.714
Not if you take a nap at home.

33:30.749 --> 33:32.650
Oh, come on. If I go home,

33:32.684 --> 33:33.751
I'm just going to have
Daniel knocking at my door

33:33.785 --> 33:34.752
asking if he should call Grace.

33:34.786 --> 33:37.555
I thought he was seeing
his old girlfriend.

33:37.589 --> 33:39.590
They're just friends. He still
wants to go out with Grace.

33:39.624 --> 33:40.758
Oh.

33:40.792 --> 33:41.125
Would he ever marry Grace?

33:41.159 --> 33:42.826
Marry her?

33:43.795 --> 33:45.863
Wait.

33:45.897 --> 33:49.767
Why do I have a feeling I'm about
to step into a very bad conversation?

33:49.801 --> 33:52.870
The mere mention of someone else's
marriage makes you that nervous?

33:52.904 --> 33:55.839
We're not talking about us, we're
talking about Grace and Daniel.

33:55.874 --> 33:57.575
She's not even out of high school,

33:57.609 --> 33:58.909
how can she be thinking about marriage?

34:00.845 --> 34:02.546
Oh. Sorry.

34:02.581 --> 34:03.247
Forgot that you were...

34:03.281 --> 34:04.815
I forget myself, it's okay.

34:06.751 --> 34:09.520
You think you'll ever get married again?

34:09.554 --> 34:10.621
Sure. Why not?

34:10.655 --> 34:11.621
Will you marry me?

34:12.591 --> 34:14.558
What'd you say?

34:14.592 --> 34:15.793
Seriously. Marry me.

34:15.827 --> 34:18.896
I'm 18. I'm too young to get married.

34:18.929 --> 34:21.532
You've already been married.

34:21.565 --> 34:22.533
And I don't want to be married
again until I get out of college.

34:22.567 --> 34:24.601
But I am getting out of college.

34:24.636 --> 34:26.503
I'll he my bachelor's at
the end of the semester,

34:26.538 --> 34:29.773
and I'm going to start teaching
while I get my master's.

34:29.808 --> 34:31.708
Seriously, are you going to
find a better man than me?

34:33.844 --> 34:36.513
I love you, Adrian, and I don't
want you to be with anyone else.

34:38.583 --> 34:39.550
Ever again.

34:48.726 --> 34:51.695
Why did you do this, you jerk?

34:51.730 --> 34:54.465
It was so good, I was so happy.

34:54.498 --> 34:55.632
And now we have to
stop seeing each other.

34:55.667 --> 34:56.800
No, we don't.

34:56.835 --> 34:59.703
Look, take as long
as you want to answer.

34:59.738 --> 35:04.808
Tell me a week from now, a
month from now, a year from now.

35:04.843 --> 35:05.609
Years from now.

35:07.579 --> 35:08.746
But no cheating.

35:10.515 --> 35:12.583
And eventually you have to say yes.

35:20.433 --> 35:20.433
+

35:24.021 --> 35:25.955
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

35:25.990 --> 35:27.690
Hey. No Dylan tonight?

35:27.725 --> 35:29.659
No, I've got homework.

35:29.693 --> 35:30.793
Homework, huh? Yeah.

35:31.795 --> 35:33.763
What's going on?

35:33.797 --> 35:34.931
Nothing's going on. You sure?

35:34.965 --> 35:36.699
Positive.

35:36.734 --> 35:37.800
You seemed kind of quiet at dinner.

35:40.638 --> 35:43.740
Do you think Betty and
Camille would ever be friends?

35:43.774 --> 35:48.912
Oh, I hope not. That friendship
would not be sanctioned by me.

35:48.946 --> 35:51.681
Dylan wants to be friends
with Amy and Adrian.

35:51.715 --> 35:53.716
Keep your friends close and
your enemies closer, huh?

35:53.751 --> 35:57.954
Bunny said the same thing, but Adrian
and Amy are not Dylan's enemies.

35:57.988 --> 36:00.924
And I see it more as
Dylan's jealous of them

36:00.958 --> 36:03.626
but she's trying to overcome
that by being friends with them.

36:03.661 --> 36:04.794
Yeah. Here's the thing.

36:04.828 --> 36:07.664
She'll be friends with them
as long as they each have

36:07.698 --> 36:09.999
someone in their lives
that they're happy with.

36:10.034 --> 36:13.670
If Amy breaks up with Ricky or
Adrian breaks up with her new guy,

36:13.704 --> 36:17.840
then she's only going to be friends
with them to keep them away from you.

36:17.875 --> 36:19.909
Is that so bad?

36:19.944 --> 36:25.014
Everything you say or do will be shared
by Dylan with your exes and vice versa.

36:25.049 --> 36:27.850
I'm just saying that there
is no reason for Dylan

36:27.885 --> 36:28.384
to be friends with Amy or Adrian.

36:28.419 --> 36:31.588
She has girlfriends.

36:31.622 --> 36:35.658
If you and Adrian, or you and
Amy were divorced with kids

36:35.693 --> 36:37.894
then it would be good if your
girlfriend or wife was friends with them.

36:38.829 --> 36:40.863
But you don't have that complication

36:40.898 --> 36:41.831
and you don't need that complication.

36:41.865 --> 36:45.668
Yeah, but I'm friends
with Amy and Adrian,

36:45.703 --> 36:47.737
so it seems Dylan should be
friends with Amy and Adrian.

36:47.771 --> 36:48.838
You're friends with Adrian?

36:48.872 --> 36:49.339
We're on friendly terms.

36:49.373 --> 36:51.774
That's different.

36:51.809 --> 36:53.743
And you're on friendly
terms with Amy? Since when?

36:53.777 --> 36:55.945
Eh, it's kind of happened gradually.

36:55.980 --> 36:57.647
You're not going to be friends with Amy.

36:57.681 --> 37:00.883
She's engaged to be married
to Ricky, and Ricky...

37:02.820 --> 37:04.921
Oh, no.

37:04.955 --> 37:05.722
Don't even think about it.

37:12.963 --> 37:14.864
Yeah.

37:14.898 --> 37:16.799
Well, I'm sure he hasn't called you

37:16.834 --> 37:18.935
because he's thinking about it.

37:18.969 --> 37:22.972
But let me tell you, I know Leo.

37:23.007 --> 37:27.710
And if you could just change your
mind about having a baby Boykewich,

37:27.745 --> 37:30.580
that would be fantastic.

37:30.614 --> 37:34.584
Well, I'd like to, Betty, but
that's honestly how I feel.

37:34.618 --> 37:35.885
And I'm embarrassed
that that's how I feel

37:35.919 --> 37:39.622
and I'm even more
embarrassed that Leo told you.

37:39.657 --> 37:41.824
Oh, I knew you would be.

37:41.859 --> 37:44.627
It's just that, you know, I
thought if we talked about it,

37:44.662 --> 37:47.797
then maybe I could help
you save your relationship.

37:47.831 --> 37:52.602
I mean, you're kind of old to
be having a baby, aren't you?

37:52.636 --> 37:56.706
Well, other women my
age are having babies.

37:56.740 --> 37:57.907
It can be done.

37:58.942 --> 38:00.710
Yeah, but

38:00.744 --> 38:02.812
not without completely
wrecking your sex life.

38:05.783 --> 38:08.818
And Ben is so screwed up,

38:08.852 --> 38:11.754
that I don't think Leo is ever
gonna want to roll those dice again.

38:11.789 --> 38:14.724
And he's really looking forward to

38:14.758 --> 38:17.694
Ben getting out of high school next year

38:17.728 --> 38:19.862
and going off to college, far away.

38:19.897 --> 38:21.731
I don't know if I'm comfortable

38:21.765 --> 38:24.701
talking about these
things with you, Betty.

38:24.735 --> 38:25.168
I think maybe I should just call Leo.

38:25.170 --> 38:27.670
Sure you should.

38:27.705 --> 38:30.740
But you can stillshould talk to me.Leo.

38:31.642 --> 38:32.675
We're friends.

38:43.754 --> 38:44.721
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

38:49.993 --> 38:52.829
Are you Jacob?

38:52.863 --> 38:55.898
Yes, ma'am. Interesting.

38:55.933 --> 38:56.933
I'm Margaret. Ethan's foster mom.

38:56.967 --> 38:59.769
Also interesting.

38:59.803 --> 39:00.970
You're also Ricky's mom?

39:01.004 --> 39:02.672
Yes, I am.

39:04.007 --> 39:07.810
Ethan was caught
sneaking out of the house

39:07.845 --> 39:09.712
and I wanted to let you know

39:09.747 --> 39:10.813
that he is not allowed out of
the house without my permission,

39:10.848 --> 39:14.684
especially not at 9:00 on a school night

39:14.718 --> 39:17.653
to let you copy his homework.

39:17.688 --> 39:18.921
To let me copy his homework?

39:18.956 --> 39:20.723
Yes.

39:20.758 --> 39:22.959
Uh. Thank you for letting me know

39:22.993 --> 39:25.862
and for driving all the
way over here to tell me.

39:25.896 --> 39:29.766
I came all the way over
here to talk to Kathleen,

39:29.800 --> 39:32.835
but Tom says she's already in bed.

39:32.870 --> 39:34.704
Right. That's why I
came out here to study,

39:34.738 --> 39:36.639
so I wouldn't disturb her studying.

39:36.673 --> 39:40.910
Yeah? You make a lot of
noise studying, do you?

39:40.944 --> 39:43.746
I like to read out loud,
it helps me remember things.

39:43.781 --> 39:45.848
Well, see if you can remember this.

39:45.883 --> 39:47.884
I know about the girls.

39:47.918 --> 39:50.820
I know Ethan was sneaking
now to come over here

39:50.854 --> 39:55.024
so that the two of you could
hook up with two 17-year-olds.

39:57.060 --> 40:00.963
You're too young to be
going out with 17-year-olds.

40:00.998 --> 40:05.735
And you're too smart to get
yourself into trouble with Ethan.

40:05.769 --> 40:07.804
I love him, but he can be trouble.

40:07.838 --> 40:09.906
And he can get you into trouble.

40:09.940 --> 40:14.043
Not that you're not capable of
getting into trouble yourself.

40:14.077 --> 40:16.813
I know about you, and Tom, and the car.

40:19.750 --> 40:21.784
You're not getting off
to a very good start here.

40:21.819 --> 40:22.552
I'm so sorry.

40:22.586 --> 40:24.787
This was a really stupid idea.

40:26.089 --> 40:28.925
But I don't have any friends

40:28.959 --> 40:31.861
and Ethan wants to be friends,

40:31.895 --> 40:35.665
and those girls were very pretty.

40:35.699 --> 40:38.634
Well, you can go on back inside now

40:38.669 --> 40:38.801
because they're not coming over.

40:43.841 --> 40:45.007
They're still not back.

40:45.042 --> 40:48.010
They came here to have fun,
I guess they're having fun.

40:48.045 --> 40:49.779
Yeah.

40:49.813 --> 40:51.881
Ricky is such a nice guy.

40:51.915 --> 40:54.684
Yeah, he turned out to
be a nice guy. I like him.

40:54.718 --> 40:56.652
Thanks for not going
out with Kathleen tonight

40:56.687 --> 40:58.688
and helping me with my homework.

40:58.722 --> 41:00.923
Hey, you're more important
to me than Wife Number One.

41:00.958 --> 41:01.724
Thanks, Dad. No problem.

41:03.927 --> 41:05.962
You think we'll ever
be friends, you and me?

41:05.996 --> 41:09.031
One day we'll just be two adults
talking to each other as adults?

41:09.066 --> 41:11.033
Yeah, when you get to be an
adult and behave like an adult,

41:11.068 --> 41:12.835
then that can happen.

41:12.870 --> 41:15.671
But until then, you're my little girl.

41:15.706 --> 41:17.006
And my little girl does
not fail summer school.

41:17.040 --> 41:20.910
All right, let's look
at this list again.

41:20.944 --> 41:22.778
Who was allied with
whom during World War II?

41:24.781 --> 41:27.984
Ugh! At this point, I'm so tired,

41:28.018 --> 41:29.785
I don't even think I know
what the word "ally" means.

41:29.820 --> 41:31.888
Allies are like friends.

41:31.922 --> 41:33.723
Two countries who share a
common enemy or a common goal.

41:33.757 --> 41:35.992
But allies change over the
years, you know what I mean?

41:36.026 --> 41:39.929
I think I do.

41:39.963 --> 41:41.764
You don't think I should
be friends with Ben?

41:41.798 --> 41:42.932
Not unless you want World War III.

41:45.903 --> 41:47.770
Tell Ricky you talked
to Ben at the pizza joint

41:47.804 --> 41:48.905
and then drop it.

41:48.939 --> 41:51.908
Amy, you and Ben don't
need to be friends.

41:51.942 --> 41:52.909
You don't need to be enemies,

41:52.943 --> 41:54.744
but you don't need to be friends.
