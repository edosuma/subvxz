00:32.292 --> 00:33.752
Hello.

00:33.794 --> 00:35.504
Good morning, Doug.

00:35.546 --> 00:37.714
I missed you.

00:39.508 --> 00:40.801
Who is this?

00:40.884 --> 00:43.804
Come on. I know you know me.

00:43.846 --> 00:46.181
Refresh my memory.

00:46.306 --> 00:47.891
What did we do?

00:48.016 --> 00:49.685
Don't be naughty.

00:49.810 --> 00:51.854
Not yet.

00:51.895 --> 00:55.190
We met at the ceremony where
they retired your number.

00:55.315 --> 00:57.609
I was the brunette by the bar.

00:58.986 --> 01:02.197
I'll cry if you don't remember me.

01:02.281 --> 01:04.908
Or what I said I'd do.

01:04.992 --> 01:06.243
Right.

01:06.285 --> 01:07.494
Brunette.

01:07.619 --> 01:08.745
Big blue eyes.

01:08.787 --> 01:11.081
Touchdown, quarterback.

01:11.123 --> 01:13.125
let me ask you something.

01:13.167 --> 01:15.043
Are you still with your wife?

01:15.085 --> 01:18.005
Oh, she's out. Pilates or
something- forget about her.

01:18.088 --> 01:19.381
Okay.

01:19.506 --> 01:24.720
So, what was your most
exciting experience?

01:24.803 --> 01:28.849
Winning your first,
second or third ring?

01:28.891 --> 01:33.395
What if I said my most exciting
experience was talking to you, honey?

01:33.812 --> 01:36.607
now you're just being bad.

01:36.690 --> 01:42.696
Okay, after the birth of my daughter,
I'd have to say my induction.

01:42.905 --> 01:44.907
I remember your speech.

01:44.990 --> 01:47.284
You were on crutches, right?

01:47.326 --> 01:48.160
That's right.

01:48.202 --> 01:50.787
Fourth surgery on my right knee.

01:50.913 --> 01:54.082
It starts like an S.O.B. when it rains.

01:54.124 --> 01:55.542
You follow football?

01:55.584 --> 01:56.960
Always been a fan.

01:57.002 --> 01:59.588
You can blame my dad for that.

01:59.880 --> 02:05.093
You know, I read recently
that you were hospitalized.

02:05.135 --> 02:08.347
Was it anything serious?

02:08.388 --> 02:14.812
Okay... now you're starting
to sound like a reporter.

02:14.853 --> 02:17.397
Are you writing a story or something?

02:17.481 --> 02:19.900
Or something.

02:20.108 --> 02:24.696
How would you like... to be remembered?

02:28.283 --> 02:29.701
Doug?

02:29.910 --> 02:31.495
Are you okay?

02:32.204 --> 02:33.997
Is everything all right?

02:34.289 --> 02:35.415
Doug?

02:38.502 --> 02:39.795
Doug?

02:41.505 --> 02:42.756
Hello?

02:42.798 --> 02:44.007
Doug?

02:44.091 --> 02:46.093
Are you still there?

02:46.135 --> 02:47.594
Hello?

02:47.678 --> 02:49.096
Doug?

02:57.187 --> 02:58.814
Hey, H.

03:00.190 --> 03:01.942
Detective.

03:01.984 --> 03:02.943
What have you got?

03:02.985 --> 03:05.320
The victim is Doug Mcclain.

03:05.487 --> 03:07.990
The football player.

03:08.615 --> 03:10.117
Who called it in?

03:10.159 --> 03:11.368
The wife.

03:11.410 --> 03:14.288
Said she got back from Augustine
and found him on the floor.

03:14.413 --> 03:16.582
Although he retired 12
years ago, he's still a star,

03:16.623 --> 03:18.792
so when this breaks,
it's gonna break big.

03:18.917 --> 03:21.753
Do we have control of
the media, detective?

03:21.795 --> 03:25.090
Oh, as good as can be expected,
given the circumstances.

03:25.507 --> 03:27.176
- The body's in here.
- okay

03:27.217 --> 03:30.095
He's got a stab wound through the neck.

03:30.387 --> 03:32.306
Have we located the murder weapon yet?

03:32.347 --> 03:33.140
Did a cursory.

03:33.182 --> 03:35.309
Didn't see anything, but...

03:35.392 --> 03:37.394
we got this.

03:37.519 --> 03:38.270
Okay.

03:38.312 --> 03:39.271
Check his phone records.

03:39.313 --> 03:42.399
Maybe he was attempting
to call for help.

03:42.483 --> 03:43.901
- Already working on it.
- Thank you.

03:43.984 --> 03:45.152
Alexx?

03:45.194 --> 03:49.698
Whoever stabbed him
perfectly severed his carotid.

03:49.740 --> 03:51.200
This spray...

03:51.283 --> 03:55.287
is from his last three heartbeats.

03:57.998 --> 04:04.087
Only get that kind of force and volume
with a total arterial transection.

04:04.129 --> 04:07.591
Alexx, I don't see any defensive wounds.

04:09.218 --> 04:10.677
It doesn't make sense.

04:10.719 --> 04:14.515
Doug Mcclain was one of the
best athletes of his time.

04:14.598 --> 04:17.892
A man like this would never
go down without a fight.

04:18.017 --> 04:19.603
Till today.

05:19.565 --> 05:22.651
Okay. That doesn't look good.

05:22.693 --> 05:23.902
What's going on?

05:23.944 --> 05:27.656
The victim's wife and that
character want the body.

05:27.740 --> 05:29.325
For what?

05:29.408 --> 05:30.951
Cryonics.

05:31.035 --> 05:32.953
They want to freeze him?

05:33.037 --> 05:35.331
That's what they said.

05:41.962 --> 05:43.380
Excuse me.

05:43.422 --> 05:44.840
Mrs. Mcclain?

05:45.132 --> 05:47.343
I'm Alexx Woods, M.E.

05:47.468 --> 05:49.637
I'm sorry for your loss.

05:49.970 --> 05:51.347
Thank you.

05:51.430 --> 05:54.600
But I can't let you
take your husband's body.

05:54.642 --> 05:58.562
But it was Doug's wish to be frozen
until he could be cryonically revived.

05:58.646 --> 06:01.732
He made all of the arrangements
with the cryonic facility and...

06:01.857 --> 06:02.858
and dr. Klein...

06:02.941 --> 06:03.567
yes.

06:03.651 --> 06:08.113
I understand, but that was
before he died a vioeant dleth.

06:08.155 --> 06:12.368
An autopsy could seriously
compromise Doug's chances of revival.

06:12.451 --> 06:16.747
With all due respect, doctor,
fame doesn't exempt him.

06:16.789 --> 06:19.667
I have jurisdiction over
the remains of his body.

06:19.750 --> 06:21.835
Here. Does this help?

06:22.461 --> 06:25.422
It's an injunction from judge Porterson.

06:25.464 --> 06:29.551
An autopsy will never bring
back Doug, but some day...

06:30.469 --> 06:32.429
science will.

06:33.555 --> 06:38.143
I have an eight- year-old daughter,
and I know it sounds crazy, but...

06:38.936 --> 06:41.730
Doug wanted to see her grow up.

06:43.357 --> 06:45.401
This way, maybe...

06:45.442 --> 06:47.486
one day he will see her.

06:47.528 --> 06:49.321
And maybe even her children.

06:49.363 --> 06:51.156
We'll just take the body.

06:51.240 --> 06:54.034
Okay, this is subject
to court ajudication.

06:54.159 --> 06:56.870
In the meantime, you better
find me a seat in your van,

06:56.912 --> 07:00.249
because that body does
not leave my sight.

07:00.291 --> 07:01.458
Certainly.

07:01.542 --> 07:02.918
Mcclain was inducted into the
hall of fame just last year.

07:02.960 --> 07:07.548
Famed football quarterback Doug Mcclain was
found murdered in his home early this morning.

07:07.589 --> 07:09.967
He broke records in 1988
for total yards thrown.

07:10.009 --> 07:12.344
Doug's wife, Elissa, was
not available for comment.

07:12.469 --> 07:16.640
Stay tuned to channel four news,
as we continue to bring you...

07:17.641 --> 07:19.143
that's heparin, isn't it?

07:19.184 --> 07:20.436
Yes.

07:20.644 --> 07:25.065
You do realize an anti-coagulant
is elusess on the dead, right?

07:25.149 --> 07:26.400
Dead to you, doctor.

07:26.692 --> 07:29.403
We operate with a different definition.

07:29.444 --> 07:32.114
Heparin helps maintain tissue viability.

07:35.617 --> 07:37.703
Okay. Get him in.

07:45.586 --> 07:48.297
You find anything, csi Duquesne?

07:49.006 --> 07:51.466
Only smudges, detective berkeley.

07:51.508 --> 07:53.886
I didn't hear you leave this morning.

07:54.011 --> 07:57.514
Well, you know, a girl's
got to keep some mystery.

07:57.598 --> 07:58.682
Okay.

07:58.807 --> 08:01.018
Well, what do you got on this one?

08:01.101 --> 08:05.480
Well, I can tell you there was no forced
entry and this window was the only thing open.

08:05.606 --> 08:07.900
Well, it might be how the killer got in.

08:09.484 --> 08:11.486
This doesn't belong.

08:11.612 --> 08:12.654
What is it?

08:12.696 --> 08:15.699
It's a piece of double-sided
tape, but look at the fibers in it.

08:15.741 --> 08:17.284
It's too short to be carpet.

08:17.409 --> 08:19.703
I bet it was pulled off of
whoever came through the window.

08:19.786 --> 08:21.413
You find anything?

08:21.496 --> 08:22.372
Oh, yeah.

08:22.414 --> 08:25.292
Just... probable motive.

08:43.184 --> 08:45.979
Somebody took Mcclain's
three championship rings.

08:46.021 --> 08:47.356
"1995 championship ball. "

08:47.397 --> 08:49.983
I'm assuming there used
to be a football there.

08:50.025 --> 08:52.486
It would have been from his last game.

08:52.903 --> 08:57.699
Took his team into the championship
one last time and then retired.

08:57.991 --> 08:59.743
The man was a class act.

08:59.785 --> 09:02.204
You know, I knew that
you liked football,

09:02.246 --> 09:04.581
but I wasn't aware that
you were so into it.

09:04.706 --> 09:08.460
Well, you need your mornings,
I need my sunday afternoons.

09:08.502 --> 09:12.381
So you really think that Mcclain
was killed for a few keepsakes?

09:12.422 --> 09:13.590
Keepsakes?

09:13.715 --> 09:16.301
The stuff in this room's
got to be worth a fortune.

09:16.343 --> 09:18.720
Well, then, why not take it all?

09:19.012 --> 09:23.016
Three championship rings and a signed
team ball is definitely worth the most.

09:23.058 --> 09:26.603
Then I think the killer
definitely knew what he was doing.

09:28.897 --> 09:30.816
You gonna be able to
pull any prints off that?

09:30.899 --> 09:32.818
It's worth a try.

09:33.902 --> 09:35.445
Alexx, what do you got?

09:35.487 --> 09:39.199
Doug Mcclain's wife presented
a signed court order, Horatio.

09:39.241 --> 09:40.492
Signed by who?

09:40.617 --> 09:46.081
Judge Porterson, miami's leading
advocate of progresvesi science.

09:46.123 --> 09:47.791
You mean leading advocate
of science fiction.

09:47.916 --> 09:50.586
It's gonna take a hearing before
I can get Doug under my knife.

09:50.627 --> 09:51.920
By then, we could lose everything.

09:52.004 --> 09:52.796
Okay, here's what we do.

09:52.838 --> 09:54.047
Shift to plan "B."

09:54.089 --> 09:56.300
I'm on my way to precore now.

09:56.341 --> 09:57.551
I'll let you know.

09:57.593 --> 09:58.802
Keep me posted.

10:05.893 --> 10:09.021
Hey, d g youidet a chance to look over the
things I brought in from the trophy case?

10:09.062 --> 10:12.107
Yeah. I got a print
on that pair of cleats.

10:15.402 --> 10:19.114
But it doesn't match Doug Mcclain or
his wife, and afis doesn't recognize it.

10:19.156 --> 10:20.991
Well, nothing comes easy, doeshat?

10:21.033 --> 10:21.950
W it's that?

10:21.992 --> 10:24.912
You were right about the sticky
tape you found by the window.

10:24.995 --> 10:27.581
The fibers don't match
anything in Mcclain's house.

10:27.623 --> 10:29.082
It's silk.

10:29.208 --> 10:30.459
Italian silk.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.502
Killer could have brought
it in on his clothing.

10:32.586 --> 10:34.713
Yeah. Unfortunately, a
lot of people wear it.

10:34.755 --> 10:36.798
Well, you got anything better?

10:36.840 --> 10:37.507
No.

10:37.591 --> 10:39.343
But Mcclain was on the phone
at the time of the murder,

10:39.384 --> 10:42.387
so Tripp is running the records
to see who he was talking to.

10:42.512 --> 10:43.597
You think he has somebody?

10:43.680 --> 10:46.516
Yeah. Her name is Wendy Legassic.

10:49.019 --> 10:50.979
Wendy Legassic, I'm Calleigh Duquesne.

10:51.104 --> 10:52.189
Hi.

10:52.314 --> 10:53.815
That's a pretty top.

10:53.899 --> 10:55.317
Is it silk?

10:55.400 --> 10:56.610
Yeah.

10:56.818 --> 10:59.488
We're going to have to take a
sample of your top to compare to

10:59.613 --> 11:02.491
some fibers we found at the
Doug Mcclain crime scene.

11:02.533 --> 11:04.201
What makes you think I
was at the crime scene?

11:04.243 --> 11:05.244
According to the phone records,

11:05.285 --> 11:08.288
you were the last person to speak
to Doug Mcclain before he was killed.

11:08.413 --> 11:11.500
The closest I got to him was the phone.

11:11.583 --> 11:14.586
I was just updating his obituary.

11:16.088 --> 11:16.964
I'm sorry?

11:17.005 --> 11:20.592
Newspapers like to be prepared
for an unexpected death.

11:20.717 --> 11:26.515
We have obituaries of people still alive on
file so when they pass, we're ready to print.

11:26.557 --> 11:28.183
That is morbid.

11:28.308 --> 11:30.519
So I take it that you're a reporter?

11:30.602 --> 11:34.690
My boss gave me a list of names
and told me to update them.

11:34.731 --> 11:36.942
And people will just talk to you?

11:36.984 --> 11:39.611
You figure out ways
to get them to open up.

11:39.653 --> 11:41.363
Doug was a jock.

11:41.405 --> 11:43.782
It's pretty obvious what part
of the ego you have to stroke.

11:43.907 --> 11:46.493
I was the brunette by the bar.

11:47.703 --> 11:51.081
I'll cry if you don't remember me.

11:51.915 --> 11:54.710
That's the list of people
that I had to update.

11:54.751 --> 11:56.420
See? Doug Mcclain?

11:56.503 --> 11:58.338
Fidel castro, dick cheney...

11:58.380 --> 12:00.757
I don't understand why Doug
would be at the top the list.

12:00.799 --> 12:03.051
He doesn't have near the medical
history of these other people.

12:03.093 --> 12:07.389
My boss says that retired football
players have a high mortality rate.

12:07.431 --> 12:09.391
Something about the
abuse to their bodies.

12:09.516 --> 12:11.894
And the abuse got a whole lot
worse during the phone call.

12:11.935 --> 12:13.687
Am I right?

12:14.021 --> 12:15.772
What are you accusing me of?

12:15.814 --> 12:17.941
It just seems to be an
incredible coincidence that

12:17.983 --> 12:21.320
Doug Mcclain would be killed on the
same day you were updating his obituary.

12:21.403 --> 12:24.698
That doesn't mean I had
anything to do with it.

12:24.907 --> 12:26.617
Are you sure?

12:27.701 --> 12:28.952
You didn't keep Doug on the phone

12:28.994 --> 12:30.996
so that someone would have
opportunity to kill him?

12:31.079 --> 12:32.289
Why would I do that?

12:32.414 --> 12:33.916
I don't know.

12:34.416 --> 12:36.501
But I'm going to find out.

12:40.297 --> 12:42.007
Have you prepped the equipment, doctor?

12:42.049 --> 12:42.841
Yes.

12:42.883 --> 12:44.593
What are you using it for?

12:44.718 --> 12:48.680
Well, if I can't perform a traditional
autopsy to figure out what happened to him,

12:48.722 --> 12:51.099
I'm going to conduct a virtopsy.

12:51.183 --> 12:52.684
As long as you do it quickly.

12:52.809 --> 12:55.145
We need to get him into a neuropod asap.

12:55.187 --> 12:58.482
I have to warn you, it's
going to be freezing in there.

13:15.415 --> 13:16.583
Yes.

13:16.917 --> 13:18.585
Horatio. Yes.

13:19.002 --> 13:21.547
I'm working on our quarterback now.

13:21.588 --> 13:25.008
Right. Right. But this will
take longer than the real thing.

13:25.092 --> 13:30.305
I have to compile each scan until I get
a fully-rendered model of the knife wound.

13:30.389 --> 13:32.057
I understand, Alexx. What else?

13:32.099 --> 13:36.311
According to early data, he
does have a fracture on his hand.

13:36.395 --> 13:40.107
Looks like to the second metacarpal,
with swelling around the wrist.

13:40.148 --> 13:41.441
Swelling around the wrist?

13:41.483 --> 13:44.194
Perhaps he punched
someone or something, huh?

13:44.236 --> 13:44.862
Yeah.

13:44.903 --> 13:46.905
Looks like he may have
fought back after all.

13:46.989 --> 13:49.616
Maybe. Keep me posted.

13:59.918 --> 14:00.752
Hey.

14:00.794 --> 14:04.006
Hey. You hear anything from
Calleigh about the obit writer?

14:04.089 --> 14:05.007
Wendy?

14:05.090 --> 14:06.842
Calleigh couldn't
place her at the scene.

14:06.884 --> 14:08.594
All right. I guess we keep digging, huh?

14:08.635 --> 14:09.386
What have you got?

14:09.511 --> 14:13.181
Well, I'm trying to track down Doug
Mcclain's stolen memorabilia off the internet.

14:13.307 --> 14:15.309
How many sites have you been to?

14:15.350 --> 14:17.311
14... so far.

14:17.394 --> 14:19.479
you know how many
sites there are, right?

14:19.897 --> 14:21.398
Yeah.

14:22.983 --> 14:24.359
wait a minute. Go back.

14:24.401 --> 14:26.820
There's some football stuff there.

14:27.905 --> 14:30.407
Championship rings.

14:30.782 --> 14:31.992
That them?

14:32.034 --> 14:33.160
Looks like it.

14:33.202 --> 14:36.872
Championship years '92, '93 and '95.

14:36.914 --> 14:39.208
Yeah. And there's the
football right there.

14:39.249 --> 14:41.418
Oh, ye of little faith.

14:41.501 --> 14:44.338
All of these items were put up
for auction by a Theo Knight.

14:44.379 --> 14:47.799
Well, Theo's about to get a very
disappointing return on his investment.

14:47.841 --> 14:49.593
Let me call Horatio.

15:02.689 --> 15:04.441
Why do you guys need my prints?

15:04.483 --> 15:06.401
We have reason to believe
that Doug Mcclain was killed

15:06.443 --> 15:08.820
during a robbery of his
football memorabilia.

15:08.862 --> 15:10.614
You seem like quite a fan, Theo.

15:10.697 --> 15:12.908
My dad lived and died by Doug Mcclain.

15:12.991 --> 15:15.494
Every snap. Every pass.

15:16.787 --> 15:20.415
What, you guys think I broke into his
house to steal from his personal collection?

15:20.499 --> 15:21.667
We don't know.

15:21.708 --> 15:24.294
We found a fingerprint,
though, on an old cleat of his.

15:24.336 --> 15:26.380
Is that going to match one of these?

15:27.881 --> 15:29.383
It may.

15:30.300 --> 15:33.095
I was there two weeks
ago, but not last night.

15:33.220 --> 15:35.305
I bought this stuff. I spent a fortune.

15:35.389 --> 15:40.185
So he sold you three championship rings
and an autographed team ball willingly?

15:40.227 --> 15:41.520
Well, his manager did.

15:41.603 --> 15:42.604
Martin Wilson.

15:42.688 --> 15:43.981
He gave me a good price.

15:44.022 --> 15:45.607
I had to have it.

15:45.899 --> 15:46.775
You had to have it?

15:46.817 --> 15:51.488
You were online within hours
of his murder selling it, Theo.

15:52.281 --> 15:53.866
I was going to add it
to my collection here,

15:53.907 --> 15:58.203
but when one of these legends
dies, collectors go into a frenzy.

15:58.245 --> 15:58.871
Right.

15:58.912 --> 16:03.000
News breaks, your 100-k investment
climbs up to seven figures. Is that right?

16:03.041 --> 16:05.544
I guess I'm a lucky guy.

16:05.627 --> 16:08.088
Yes, but not for long.

16:20.395 --> 16:23.607
Tragic day for the
sports world, mr. Wilson.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.776
Doug Mcclain was a legend.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.529
Yes. And I understand you
were his business manager.

16:28.570 --> 16:30.280
And now I'm managing his estate.

16:30.322 --> 16:33.325
And selling it off rather rapidly, too.

16:33.367 --> 16:34.827
What are you talking about?

16:34.910 --> 16:43.001
Apparently, you just sold some pieces of
memorabilia to a Theo Knight for $100, 000.

16:44.628 --> 16:46.422
I had to.

16:46.630 --> 16:48.799
Doug had, um...

16:49.091 --> 16:50.676
cash flow problems.

16:50.717 --> 16:53.512
He spent money like he
was still in his prime.

16:53.595 --> 16:56.723
Got so bad, I had to sell his
stuff just to keep him afloat.

16:56.765 --> 16:58.684
I notice that you have a black eye.

16:58.725 --> 17:01.353
Now, we found mr. Mcclain
with a broken hand.

17:01.395 --> 17:04.397
Am I to assume that he was not
happy about what you were doing?

17:04.522 --> 17:06.275
It was a sore subject.

17:06.316 --> 17:09.819
Dougie wore those on
that naked bootleg, '93.

17:09.903 --> 17:11.405
Game winner.

17:11.613 --> 17:13.073
What else you got?

17:13.115 --> 17:14.825
Well, over here we have his first...

17:14.907 --> 17:16.827
what the hell's going on?

17:16.910 --> 17:19.204
You told me a reporter
was coming in here.

17:19.246 --> 17:20.497
Would you excuse us for a minute?

17:20.539 --> 17:21.540
Sure.

17:21.582 --> 17:22.499
Thanks.

17:26.002 --> 17:28.505
You're selling all my stuff?

17:28.797 --> 17:30.424
This is my life.

17:30.507 --> 17:34.219
If it wasn't for me,
you wouldn't have a life.

17:35.095 --> 17:37.973
Was that before you
killed him this morning?

17:38.015 --> 17:40.809
I was nowhere near Doug
Mcclain this morning.

17:41.101 --> 17:42.728
You can check.

17:42.811 --> 17:44.605
I'm going to.

17:56.200 --> 17:59.203
You're running the double-sided
tape from Doug Mcclain's windowsill?

17:59.244 --> 18:00.162
Yeah. I already did.

18:00.204 --> 18:04.291
You had silk fibers on one side, but
even better- epithelials on the other.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.293
And what would cause that?

18:06.335 --> 18:07.503
You're such a guy.

18:07.628 --> 18:10.506
Remember J-Lo's green versace dress?

18:10.798 --> 18:13.008
what do you think held that up?

18:13.300 --> 18:15.260
Double-sided adhesive?

18:15.302 --> 18:17.221
This is wardrobe tape.

18:17.805 --> 18:19.014
Did you get a profile from it?

18:19.098 --> 18:21.809
CODIS should tell us any second.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.603
Rita Sullivan.

18:25.312 --> 18:27.272
She's got an interesting rap sheet.

18:27.314 --> 18:31.401
One and only arrest, 2004, for
breaking and entering a residence.

18:31.527 --> 18:34.530
Yeah. She broke into
Doug Mcclain's house.

18:35.406 --> 18:39.701
That was three years ago, and that
was a complete misunderstanding.

18:39.743 --> 18:41.537
Doug and I were having an affair,

18:41.578 --> 18:43.330
and his wife caught us in their bed,

18:43.372 --> 18:45.332
and she completely overreacted.

18:45.374 --> 18:47.292
You know that Doug Mcclain's dead?

18:47.334 --> 18:49.920
I know. I saw it on tv.

18:50.003 --> 18:52.464
Well, we found tape from your dress

18:52.506 --> 18:56.093
that proves you entered his
house again, through a window.

18:59.513 --> 19:02.099
That's because Doug
called me a few days ago

19:02.141 --> 19:03.892
and asked me if I wanted to come over.

19:04.017 --> 19:05.394
He said his wife was away.

19:05.436 --> 19:06.603
Did you?

19:08.021 --> 19:10.399
And when I got there,
he wasn't home yet.

19:10.441 --> 19:12.693
So why not wait, hmm?

19:12.901 --> 19:14.611
Why climb through a window?

19:14.695 --> 19:17.698
I knew Doug since his playing days.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.950
We had a special relationship.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.119
And I wanted to surprise him.

19:31.295 --> 19:33.505
I was gone before dawn.

19:33.922 --> 19:35.924
Can you prove that?

19:36.300 --> 19:39.720
Look, I know what you're trying to
say, but I would never hurt Doug.

19:39.803 --> 19:41.221
Never.

19:43.098 --> 19:46.393
I think you got tired of climbing
through windows, miss Sullivan.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.479
I think you got tired of
being Doug's second choice.

19:48.520 --> 19:56.028
Being Doug Mcclain's second choice
was more than any girl could ask for.

19:56.111 --> 19:58.113
Except being his first.

20:05.829 --> 20:09.708
you know, there is a great thai
restaurant next to the shore club.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.502
You don't give up, do you?

20:12.795 --> 20:13.462
Neither do I.

20:13.504 --> 20:14.505
Now, be careful with that, girl.

20:14.630 --> 20:16.715
You gotta make sure it's
pulled right back to your...

20:17.591 --> 20:19.593
shoulder or it's going
to kick back. You okay?

20:19.635 --> 20:20.928
Okay?

20:21.011 --> 20:21.804
All right.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.722
Yep. I'm good. All right.

20:29.103 --> 20:30.604
I'm going to check out.

20:30.646 --> 20:31.730
Oh, yeah?

20:32.106 --> 20:34.024
Knyou ow, I... I saw
what happened out there.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.693
Is your, um, shoulder okay?

20:36.819 --> 20:38.070
Yep. I'm fine.

20:38.112 --> 20:39.321
It's good.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.198
Okay.

20:41.323 --> 20:42.699
Take care of that shoulder.

20:44.910 --> 20:48.455
by now, the world has heard about the
death of sports legend Doug Mcclain,

20:48.497 --> 20:53.085
but tonight, on tape, you will hear his
actual death at the hand of his murderers.

20:53.127 --> 20:58.215
Don't miss the newest and most exciting chapter
in the mystery that is gripping the nation.

20:58.298 --> 21:02.094
Hey, Calleigh, I think we might want to
take another look at that obituary writer.

21:02.928 --> 21:06.056
Okay, so I didn't exactly
tell you everything.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.892
That is the understatement
of the year, miss Legassic.

21:08.934 --> 21:11.395
I did call mr. Mcclain for my article.

21:11.520 --> 21:15.315
But you conveniently left out the
part where you had the murder recorded.

21:15.357 --> 21:18.402
I was taping the conversation
so I wouldn't miss anything.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.904
At the time, I wasn't even
sure atwh I was hearing.

21:20.946 --> 21:23.115
What exactly did you hear?

21:23.323 --> 21:24.575
I can't say.

21:24.616 --> 21:28.412
I signed a non-disclosure
agreement with the tv station.

21:28.454 --> 21:29.496
It's legally binding.

21:29.621 --> 21:30.914
So are handcuffs.

21:30.998 --> 21:33.208
It's your choice, Wendy.

21:35.127 --> 21:40.215
He was literally talking to me
one second and gone the next.

21:40.257 --> 21:42.384
I kept recording until
my cell battery ran out.

21:42.426 --> 21:47.014
And so your first instinct after you found
out he was killed was to sell the tape?

21:47.055 --> 21:48.599
I'm not a monster, officer.

21:48.724 --> 21:51.894
I just wanted to get out
of the obituary business.

21:53.228 --> 21:58.817
you thought the recording would
make you a reporter at wetx.

21:59.026 --> 22:00.903
I've got an exclusive for you, Wendy.

22:00.944 --> 22:02.821
That tape is never gonna make it to tv.

22:02.905 --> 22:03.906
A judge has issued a warrant,

22:04.031 --> 22:07.493
I'm confiscating it and I'm arresting
you for obstruction of justice.

22:07.618 --> 22:10.120
Your journalism career
died with Doug Mcclain.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.623
You can write an obituary for it.

22:12.706 --> 22:15.417
Okay, I uploaded Wendy
Legassic's phone conversations.

22:15.459 --> 22:15.959
What's next?

22:16.001 --> 22:20.005
Let's start with Doug
Mcclain's final words.

22:22.091 --> 22:23.842
I understand.

22:23.884 --> 22:25.594
I'm sorry.

22:29.223 --> 22:32.309
Doug, are you okay?

22:32.518 --> 22:34.019
Doug?

22:35.104 --> 22:39.108
Okay, now search for spiking activity.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.321
here's some activity.

22:44.405 --> 22:47.616
Almost 25 minutes after he was stabbed.

22:49.701 --> 22:55.999
now, that sounds like somebody
moving around the house, doesn't it?

22:59.795 --> 23:02.423
and that's somebody making a phone call.

23:02.506 --> 23:04.508
Ten digits; an area
code and a phone number.

23:04.550 --> 23:05.801
Track the numbers.

23:05.843 --> 23:07.010
I'm on it.

23:07.428 --> 23:09.513
I use reverse directory.

23:11.306 --> 23:13.308
Elissa Mcclain?

23:13.392 --> 23:15.727
Lieutenant, why would the killer
be calling the victim's wife?

23:15.811 --> 23:19.106
Because they must be connected.

23:20.399 --> 23:23.819
Mrs. Mcclain, did you hire
somebody to kill your husband?

23:23.902 --> 23:25.821
Absolutely not.

23:26.196 --> 23:27.197
Why would you ask that?

23:27.322 --> 23:31.118
Because it turns out that you and
your husband weren't living together,

23:31.160 --> 23:34.913
and your current listing is in
coral gables under your maiden name.

23:37.499 --> 23:40.419
Doug and I have been
separated for a year now.

23:40.502 --> 23:43.464
I have my own place, but
we're discreet about it.

23:43.505 --> 23:50.012
Dougeras v wy high-profile, you know, about
image control, public perception, his legacy.

23:50.095 --> 23:51.305
It was his livelihood.

23:51.430 --> 23:54.016
And a divorce would taint that.

23:54.308 --> 23:56.894
Fans hold an idealized view of Doug,

23:57.019 --> 24:02.608
and they pay big for that
perfect, infallible ideal.

24:02.649 --> 24:04.985
Okay, so let me ask you this.

24:05.027 --> 24:08.906
If you didn't hire somebody to kill
him, who called you from the crime scene?

24:08.947 --> 24:10.324
Martin.

24:11.116 --> 24:12.868
Doug's manager called.

24:12.910 --> 24:14.661
Why would he do that?

24:14.703 --> 24:16.371
To tell me what happened.

24:16.413 --> 24:20.125
He wanted me back at the house before
the police or the press got there,

24:20.167 --> 24:22.419
because everybody thinks that
Doug and I are still together.

24:22.461 --> 24:25.005
Was he there when you arrived?

24:25.714 --> 24:26.924
No.

24:33.222 --> 24:35.808
Do you think he killed Doug?

24:36.600 --> 24:38.018
Do you?

24:44.544 --> 24:49.966
Mr. Wilson, your cell phone call to Elissa Mcclain
places you at the scene at the time of the murder.

24:50.216 --> 24:52.010
I had a meeting with Doug this morning.

24:52.051 --> 24:53.261
I'm his manager.

24:53.302 --> 24:55.930
And when I found his
body, I called Elissa.

24:56.014 --> 24:59.392
'Cause you told us you were nowhere
near Doug Mcclain this morning.

24:59.434 --> 25:00.685
Now, that's a flat-out lie.

25:00.727 --> 25:05.064
Look, this is all about
discretion, damage control.

25:05.106 --> 25:08.693
I started collecting things that Doug
wouldn't want the public to find out about:

25:08.818 --> 25:14.824
Whiskey bottles, diet pills, little
blue pills, then I got out of there.

25:31.716 --> 25:36.304
I sell heroes, not broken-down stars.

25:36.596 --> 25:39.515
I'd like the items, mr. Wilson.

25:58.201 --> 25:59.702
Who's this?

25:59.911 --> 26:02.705
I took care of everything
for him but that.

26:03.206 --> 26:05.291
Never got a straight answer.

26:05.500 --> 26:06.918
I think it's time to get one.

26:28.523 --> 26:30.400
So, are there prints on the photograph?

26:30.441 --> 26:32.402
Yeah, but it's not usable.

26:32.527 --> 26:35.405
But the kid's wearing Doug's old
number, and that can't be a coincidence.

26:35.446 --> 26:36.656
No, it's not.

26:36.698 --> 26:39.826
Also, I can see part of a
logo on the back of his helmet.

26:39.867 --> 26:42.620
And it looks to me like
it says "lauderhill. "

26:45.415 --> 26:47.125
"Lauderhill youth program. "

26:47.208 --> 26:49.127
Exactly. That's what I thought.

26:49.210 --> 26:50.503
Yes.

26:50.628 --> 26:53.506
More importantly,
natalia, who is this kid?

26:53.589 --> 26:54.799
I'll call lauderhill.

26:54.841 --> 26:56.009
We got to find him.

27:01.514 --> 27:03.474
Lieutenant, april.

27:03.516 --> 27:06.019
I'm with the lauderhill youth program.

27:06.102 --> 27:07.520
Thank you for coming in.

27:07.562 --> 27:08.855
So you received our e-mail.

27:08.896 --> 27:13.526
I guess we're hoping that you may be able
to identify the child in the photograph.

27:13.609 --> 27:17.613
Yeah, we, uh, we sponsor a
youth football team every summer.

27:17.655 --> 27:19.907
He was our star quarterback.

27:20.116 --> 27:22.201
Where might I find him?

27:23.119 --> 27:25.204
Lieutenant, he had a
rare kidney disease.

27:25.246 --> 27:27.707
He died last week.

27:31.002 --> 27:33.004
What's his name?

27:33.129 --> 27:34.422
Caleb.

27:34.922 --> 27:36.799
Caleb Sullivan.

27:39.302 --> 27:40.470
May I?

27:40.511 --> 27:41.596
Sure.

27:44.599 --> 27:46.517
Sullivan.

27:52.523 --> 27:55.401
Is that your son, miss Sullivan?

27:57.612 --> 27:59.322
Yes.

28:00.698 --> 28:02.825
Who's his father?

28:05.995 --> 28:08.414
Doug Mcclain...

28:10.792 --> 28:13.628
but in DNA only.

28:16.714 --> 28:20.426
Caleb was only six
years old when he died.

28:25.890 --> 28:31.020
You know, I never asked Doug
for anything- money, nothing.

28:31.104 --> 28:34.023
I raised Caleb all on my own.

28:34.524 --> 28:37.193
He was everything to me.

28:38.903 --> 28:41.197
And then he got sick.

28:43.616 --> 28:46.119
His kidneys failed, didn't they?

28:49.706 --> 28:52.166
Uli wod have given him both of mine,

28:52.208 --> 28:55.712
but I wasn't a match, and there
was a good chance that Doug was.

28:55.753 --> 28:58.381
Dougie, he idolizes you.

28:58.423 --> 29:00.967
He even put your number
on his jersey. Please.

29:01.009 --> 29:03.511
If he doesn't get this
transplant, he will die.

29:03.594 --> 29:05.930
I'll need to check with my
attorney about this, okay?

29:05.972 --> 29:07.223
I'll see what I can do.

29:07.306 --> 29:09.809
Please, Dougie, he's so young.

29:09.851 --> 29:12.311
I'll give you a call next week.

29:15.314 --> 29:17.400
Dougie, come on!

29:18.693 --> 29:21.195
I never heard from him.

29:24.824 --> 29:29.620
You know, everyone acts like
Doug Mcclain was some big hero,

29:29.704 --> 29:33.708
but the man turned his
back on his own son.

29:37.628 --> 29:40.923
You broke into the house
this morning, didn't you?

29:42.008 --> 29:43.718
Yeah.

29:46.304 --> 29:50.099
I heard Doug on the
phone with some new girl.

29:51.017 --> 29:52.226
Same as he ever was.

29:52.310 --> 29:57.106
What if I said my most exciting
experience was talking to you, honey?

29:57.190 --> 29:59.609
Now you're starting to
sound like a reporter.

30:06.199 --> 30:08.618
then you stabbed him, Rita, didn't you?

30:09.327 --> 30:10.912
Yeah.

30:12.121 --> 30:13.623
Okay.

30:13.998 --> 30:17.001
Where is the knife now?

30:18.127 --> 30:20.505
I left it in him.

30:22.423 --> 30:24.717
Why? It's not there?

30:25.093 --> 30:29.931
Miss Sullivan, someone removed it.

30:34.602 --> 30:37.313
Rita Sullivan confessed?

30:38.231 --> 30:42.402
Alexx, she confessed to
leaving the knife in the body.

30:42.527 --> 30:44.112
We never recovered it.

30:44.153 --> 30:45.697
Wasn't at the scene.

30:45.822 --> 30:48.616
Well, that changes the scenario.

30:48.700 --> 30:52.495
Although, I'm sure she
meant to finish Doug off.

30:52.620 --> 30:54.831
But she didn't, did she?

30:54.872 --> 30:56.249
No.

30:56.290 --> 30:59.002
According to the virtopsy data,

30:59.043 --> 31:01.004
when the knife went in,

31:01.129 --> 31:04.507
it severed his carotid
artery, paralyzing Doug

31:04.549 --> 31:06.009
but not killing him.

31:06.092 --> 31:10.096
The blade plugged the hole like a cork.

31:14.100 --> 31:17.103
So the removal of the
blade is what killed him.

31:17.228 --> 31:18.187
When the knife came out,

31:18.229 --> 31:24.402
it unleashed the arterial blood just as
Doug's heart pumped its last three beats.

31:27.822 --> 31:30.992
Is there anything to
suggest Rita didn't kill him?

31:31.117 --> 31:32.994
You know, Horatio...

31:33.494 --> 31:35.204
there may be.

31:36.789 --> 31:39.292
See these dark spots in the wound?

31:39.334 --> 31:40.585
That's clotted blood.

31:40.626 --> 31:44.297
These darker portions are
coagulated red blood cells.

31:44.422 --> 31:46.716
The light ones are fibrin and platelets.

31:46.799 --> 31:49.510
And a dead body doesn't produce fibrin.

31:49.594 --> 31:52.597
With this amount of clotting,

31:52.722 --> 31:56.601
that blade had to have been inside
Doug for a significant amount of time.

31:56.642 --> 31:58.519
How long, Alexx?

31:59.312 --> 32:00.813
30, 40 minutes.

32:00.855 --> 32:02.273
30 to 40 minutes?

32:02.315 --> 32:04.817
But the recorded phone
call was only 25 minutes.

32:04.901 --> 32:06.903
So we're looking at a two-part murder.

32:06.944 --> 32:08.321
Rita started the process...

32:08.404 --> 32:10.406
and somebody else finished it.

32:21.820 --> 32:23.321
Hey.

32:23.530 --> 32:24.948
How goes it?

32:24.990 --> 32:28.994
You know, too much evidence
and not enough hours in the day.

32:29.911 --> 32:31.997
atth's the truth.

32:36.501 --> 32:38.003
Man, you okay?

32:38.211 --> 32:39.671
What's the matter?

32:39.713 --> 32:40.922
I think my shoulder's out.

32:41.006 --> 32:43.925
Oh, boy. Okay, look, you
got to go see the doctor.

32:43.967 --> 32:44.467
I can'T.

32:44.509 --> 32:45.468
This is going to go on my record,

32:45.510 --> 32:48.221
and it's going to get out
that I can't shoot a shotgun.

32:48.263 --> 32:50.890
It's not going back in on its own.

32:51.016 --> 32:52.726
Okay, well...

32:52.809 --> 32:54.894
can you do it for me?

32:55.895 --> 32:57.397
Please.

32:57.814 --> 32:59.190
All right.

33:00.108 --> 33:01.902
Just relax, okay?

33:01.943 --> 33:03.111
Okay.

33:04.112 --> 33:05.822
- You all right? You loose?
- Okay.

33:05.906 --> 33:07.616
All right, good. Look at me.

33:07.657 --> 33:09.409
All right.

33:09.618 --> 33:10.994
okay, all right.

33:11.119 --> 33:12.621
Put your arm over here.

33:12.662 --> 33:13.288
Okay?

33:13.330 --> 33:13.872
Yeah.

33:13.914 --> 33:14.998
All right.

33:15.123 --> 33:16.917
Just breathe.

33:16.958 --> 33:18.293
Okay.

33:21.421 --> 33:23.089
- Don't try to be a tough guy, all right?
- Okay.

33:23.131 --> 33:24.674
It's only going to get worse.

33:24.716 --> 33:28.303
If you need to, you go
to the doctor. All right?

33:28.803 --> 33:30.221
Okay?

33:31.514 --> 33:34.517
Thank you.

33:38.104 --> 33:39.522
Delko.

33:41.900 --> 33:43.526
Stetler.

33:43.693 --> 33:45.195
What are you sniffing around about?

33:45.320 --> 33:47.906
Horatio's got me working
to supercede a court order,

33:47.989 --> 33:50.825
reclaim your frozen
football star's body.

33:50.867 --> 33:52.911
Working with us for a change.

33:53.828 --> 33:59.709
You are aware of the pending new rules regarding
fraternization among officers, aren't you?

33:59.793 --> 34:02.921
New as in different after
you and yelina salas?

34:03.004 --> 34:04.214
Things have changed.

34:04.297 --> 34:09.511
The county's caving to the state's pressure
on the issue of sexual harassment litigation.

34:10.094 --> 34:11.263
That's interesting.

34:11.304 --> 34:15.516
The department's redefining its
policies on fraternization of officers.

34:15.600 --> 34:20.397
You would be best served sharing
that with the others in the lab.

34:20.897 --> 34:25.110
Listen, Stetler, if you have something to
say to csi Duquesne or detective berkeley,

34:25.150 --> 34:27.320
you'd best be served
telling them yourself.

34:27.362 --> 34:29.072
Duquesne and berkeley?

34:29.114 --> 34:35.411
I was talking about you and
boa vista, but thank you.

34:49.509 --> 34:50.927
Calleigh, hey.

34:51.094 --> 34:52.012
It's Delko.

34:52.094 --> 34:54.264
I... think I might have
just put you in a jam.

34:54.306 --> 34:56.725
Give me a call back when you
get the message, all right?

35:04.524 --> 35:07.527
Hey, turn it around, berkeley;
we got a suspect in the grove.

35:07.611 --> 35:09.029
Yeah, I was just coming to find you.

35:09.112 --> 35:09.988
Great, let's go.

35:10.030 --> 35:12.198
I can't work this case.

35:12.324 --> 35:13.491
Why?

35:13.992 --> 35:15.160
Because you're on it.

35:15.201 --> 35:17.495
What are you talking about?

35:17.621 --> 35:22.000
I've just been informed of pending
changes in department policy.

35:22.125 --> 35:23.919
Are you saying that we can't
work a crime scene together

35:23.960 --> 35:25.420
because we've been seeing each other?

35:25.462 --> 35:26.922
More like we can't work a crime scene

35:27.005 --> 35:28.381
because we may have a falling out

35:28.423 --> 35:32.510
and things get ugly and
job performance may suffer.

35:32.552 --> 35:34.721
You sound like you're a firm believer.

35:34.763 --> 35:35.931
No.

35:36.097 --> 35:38.391
I just got Rick Stetler
breathing down my neck.

35:38.433 --> 35:40.727
How does Rick Stetler
know anything about us?

35:40.810 --> 35:42.604
I don't know.

35:43.730 --> 35:47.817
Listen, I think we should
just take a step back

35:47.901 --> 35:50.695
let things cool down a little bit, okay?

35:50.820 --> 35:52.113
Okay.

35:56.910 --> 35:58.328
Hey, Calleigh.

35:58.411 --> 36:00.997
I heard you were riding over
to Martin Wilson's house.

36:01.122 --> 36:02.999
I'm going to ride with you.

36:03.416 --> 36:05.502
You might have to.

36:06.211 --> 36:07.504
Calleigh, what's up?

36:07.629 --> 36:09.005
Nothing.

36:09.422 --> 36:10.090
What's wrong?

36:10.215 --> 36:10.924
Did I interrupt something?

36:11.007 --> 36:14.594
How does Rick Stetler have even the faintest
idea what's going on in my personal life?

36:14.636 --> 36:16.596
It was an accident.

36:17.013 --> 36:18.098
I left you a message.

36:18.223 --> 36:19.391
I called you.

36:19.432 --> 36:20.600
I didn't get it.

36:22.519 --> 36:24.854
I never intended for
this to happen, okay?

36:24.896 --> 36:28.024
I don't like the situation with
jake, but I wouldn't rat you out.

36:28.108 --> 36:29.526
You know that.

36:30.193 --> 36:32.195
Let's just work the case.

36:46.293 --> 36:48.628
Going somewhere, mr. Wilson?

36:49.796 --> 36:51.715
Ah, back again.

36:51.798 --> 36:54.092
You guys are thorough, aren't you?

36:54.426 --> 36:55.885
What's in the envelope, Martin?

36:55.927 --> 36:58.597
Doug's personal effects
I picked up from precore.

36:58.722 --> 37:00.390
You know, everything has its place.

37:00.515 --> 37:03.101
What about the murder
weapon, does it have a place?

37:03.143 --> 37:05.270
Hey, I didn't take the knife.

37:05.312 --> 37:07.230
He was dead, and I wasn't
about to mess with him.

37:07.314 --> 37:08.398
He wasn't dead.

37:08.523 --> 37:11.026
He bled out after the
knife was extracted.

37:11.109 --> 37:12.903
He died over 30 minutes
after he was stabbed,

37:12.944 --> 37:13.987
and you were right there.

37:14.029 --> 37:16.031
Look, I have been
nothing but cooperative.

37:16.072 --> 37:17.616
Feel free to open it up.

37:17.699 --> 37:19.326
Whatever you want.

37:26.791 --> 37:29.294
What are you doing
with a body bag, Wilson?

37:29.628 --> 37:31.171
That's Doug's also.

37:31.212 --> 37:32.672
I'm not working now,

37:32.714 --> 37:36.009
and I figured it would be the
last big ticket item I could sell.

37:36.092 --> 37:38.803
Wow, you're a real class act, Martin.

37:40.430 --> 37:43.808
Something's punctured right
through the bag from the inside.

37:43.892 --> 37:46.728
It's about the same width
as the wound in Doug's neck.

37:48.230 --> 37:50.398
Hey, I have no idea how that got there.

37:50.523 --> 37:52.108
What a surprise.

37:52.192 --> 37:53.401
This is coming with us.

37:53.526 --> 37:55.403
And so are you.

37:55.612 --> 37:58.657
Precore is concerned with
organ and tissue preservation.

37:58.698 --> 38:02.202
Preparing Doug Mcclain's blood
vessels and cells for cryo storage.

38:02.244 --> 38:05.205
We are not concerned
about the plastic body bag.

38:05.330 --> 38:10.502
The body bag, dr. Klein, was used to smuggle
the murder weapon away from my crime scene.

38:10.543 --> 38:15.006
Now, did you remove the
knife from mr. Mcclain's neck?

38:15.048 --> 38:17.008
I'm a scientist, lieutenant.

38:17.092 --> 38:20.804
I've been around long enough to know
you're making enormous suppositions.

38:20.845 --> 38:23.556
That may be, but I want
you to open the tank.

38:23.598 --> 38:26.101
You're going to have to take
this up with judge Porterson.

38:26.226 --> 38:29.729
To bring you up to speed, the
judge has rescinded the court order.

38:29.771 --> 38:31.273
So open the tank.

38:31.314 --> 38:32.816
I... can't do that.

38:32.899 --> 38:36.611
The neuropod's already been set
to negative 320 degrees fahrenheit.

38:36.653 --> 38:39.322
We take him out, his
preservation could be compromised.

38:39.364 --> 38:43.201
And if we don't, so will yours.

38:43.493 --> 38:44.911
Open it.

39:22.115 --> 39:23.909
what's that?

39:23.992 --> 39:29.623
That, mrs. Mcclain, is the murder weapon
which we found next to your husband's body.

39:30.206 --> 39:34.294
And that is your fingerprint.

39:37.422 --> 39:39.382
They told me it would be 40
years before they opened that.

39:39.424 --> 39:44.512
I can assure you the investigation
can't wait that long, mrs. Mcclain.

39:44.596 --> 39:47.223
I didn't want to go there.

39:50.018 --> 39:53.021
I didn't want to see Doug like that.

39:53.730 --> 39:57.692
But Martin, his manager, insisted.

39:58.693 --> 40:01.029
Wanted me to play the
part of the grieving widow.

40:01.112 --> 40:03.990
So you kept up appearances.

40:05.200 --> 40:07.702
I went back to the house.

40:10.205 --> 40:12.415
I found him there.

40:15.502 --> 40:18.213
I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

40:21.800 --> 40:23.593
I called precore.

40:23.718 --> 40:27.222
Which is when you realized
he was still alive.

40:27.514 --> 40:29.599
I heard him groan.

40:32.727 --> 40:35.397
It was... it was so soft,

40:35.438 --> 40:38.108
I thought I'd imagined it.

40:41.403 --> 40:44.114
I didn't know what to do.

40:44.197 --> 40:48.994
Martin wanted to protect the estate.

40:49.035 --> 40:51.204
His reputation.

40:51.913 --> 40:58.712
But... I just couldn't pretend anymore.

41:00.213 --> 41:03.508
The way Doug was living
his life, he was...

41:04.509 --> 41:07.721
he was depreciating every day.

41:07.804 --> 41:10.015
And he was dragging me and
our daughter down with him.

41:10.098 --> 41:14.394
He was just going to keep screwing up until
everything just came crashing down around us.

41:14.436 --> 41:17.522
So he was worth more
to you dead than alive.

41:17.564 --> 41:20.108
Is that what you're telling me?

41:22.694 --> 41:25.822
So I pulled out the knife.

41:38.001 --> 41:40.921
and like that, it was over.

41:42.505 --> 41:45.008
He bled to death.

41:45.592 --> 41:48.720
Doctor, please...

41:49.095 --> 41:50.055
take this from me.

41:50.096 --> 41:53.016
I'm sorry, mrs. Mcclain,
I can't take that knife.

41:53.099 --> 41:55.101
My husband is the
biggest name is sports.

41:55.143 --> 41:58.021
This is publicity you can't buy.

41:58.104 --> 42:01.900
Now, if you want his body in
your facility you will do this.

42:02.525 --> 42:04.819
I'm calling 911.

42:07.530 --> 42:11.326
Precore takes their van for
one lap around the block.

42:11.409 --> 42:13.411
Arrives shortly after you do.

42:24.714 --> 42:28.510
And I play my role one last time.

42:32.722 --> 42:41.106
Mrs. Mcclain, I can assure you, that the
next several years are going to be very real.
