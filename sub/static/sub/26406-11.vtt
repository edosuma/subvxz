WEBVTT

00:04.014 --> 00:07.333
So we're competing with
all the other Cloud 9's

00:07.334 --> 00:08.795
in the district and the branch

00:08.896 --> 00:11.796
with the most combined steps
by the end of the week wins.

00:11.964 --> 00:13.451
Oh, my God, are these Apple watches?

00:13.452 --> 00:15.836
Close. They're SuperCloud Step Trackers.

00:15.838 --> 00:17.638
Awesome. I was hoping to get something

00:17.640 --> 00:20.057
worse than an Apple watch.
Yes! Thank you.

00:20.059 --> 00:21.959
I've actually been meaning
to get a pedometer

00:21.961 --> 00:22.726
for my morning runs.

00:22.728 --> 00:24.711
Wait, you mean when you walk down

00:24.713 --> 00:26.497
the street to get an everything bagel?

00:26.499 --> 00:28.465
It's at least a quarter mile.

00:28.467 --> 00:29.950
These are yours to keep for the week.

00:29.952 --> 00:32.870
You have to keep them on 24/7,
they are not waterproof,

00:32.872 --> 00:35.125
and you can't get them
too hot or too cold

00:35.177 --> 00:36.665
or they will burn your skin.

00:36.725 --> 00:37.754
Okay, I'm gonna go ahead and pass.

00:37.755 --> 00:39.024
Don't worry.
There's a wheel chair setting.

00:39.025 --> 00:39.950
Oh, I'm not worried.

00:39.950 --> 00:40.683
It just sounds terrible.

00:40.684 --> 00:43.185
Well maybe this will change your mind.

00:43.603 --> 00:47.371
- The number one store wins...
- What?

00:47.491 --> 00:49.132
You said you were
going to do... you know...

00:49.877 --> 00:52.484
- What is that?
- The thing that we...

00:52.486 --> 00:54.986
The thing we talked about
in the office this morning.

00:54.988 --> 00:56.755
What? You're talking
about firing Hannah?

00:56.757 --> 00:58.590
I thought we were going to pull
her aside after the meeting.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.305
The store with the most combined steps

01:02.306 --> 01:05.297
by the end of the week wins

01:05.299 --> 01:07.921
lunch with the Regional Vice President.

01:08.736 --> 01:12.704
Come on store 1217!
Let's get to stepping!

01:12.706 --> 01:14.606
- Ow!
- Ow!

01:14.608 --> 01:18.360
My ankle. Oh, oh, it's bad.
Oh, it's... yeah, it's bad.

01:18.362 --> 01:22.781
It's bad! Ow, ow, ow, ow.
Son of a buttermilk!

01:22.783 --> 01:25.514
So Hannah, can I talk to you
outside for a second?

01:26.475 --> 01:28.860
Synced and corrected by hawken45
for www.addic7ed.com

01:31.608 --> 01:32.982
What's the point of the chat window?

01:32.983 --> 01:34.487
I think that's for us to text

01:34.488 --> 01:36.402
motivational messages to each other.

01:36.403 --> 01:38.211
I'm not sure our employees get that.

01:38.212 --> 01:41.716
Brett1217 just wrote #TheWalkingDead.

01:41.718 --> 01:44.941
Ugh. We are in dead last
and Bel-Ridge is in first.

01:44.942 --> 01:46.521
That's Colleen's branch.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.028
Oh, she probably thinks she's so great,

01:48.029 --> 01:50.615
walking around on her legs,
left foot, right foot.

01:50.616 --> 01:51.927
We get it, Colleen.

01:51.929 --> 01:53.044
What's up with you and Colleen?

01:53.046 --> 01:54.262
What's up with you and Colleen?

01:54.264 --> 01:55.363
Okay.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.599
It's too bad we don't stand
a chance of winning.

01:57.601 --> 01:59.862
I mean, lunch with the Regional VP?

01:59.863 --> 02:01.744
That would have been good
for my management track.

02:01.745 --> 02:03.033
You do come alive at lunch.

02:03.034 --> 02:05.106
- I really do.
- Oh, screw it.

02:05.108 --> 02:06.825
Let's motivate these people
and go for the gold.

02:06.827 --> 02:07.922
Yeah, that's not going to happen.

02:07.923 --> 02:09.633
We're not really the "Get to Steppin'"

02:09.634 --> 02:11.618
kind of store.
Remember our last fire drill?

02:11.619 --> 02:13.487
Half the people got winded
and just didn't make it out.

02:13.488 --> 02:14.730
You know what? I'm with Dina.

02:14.731 --> 02:16.369
We're underdogs but a lot of the times

02:16.370 --> 02:17.983
it's the underdogs that end up winning.

02:17.984 --> 02:19.387
That's not true. They just make movies

02:19.389 --> 02:20.833
about the few underdogs that do.

02:20.834 --> 02:23.518
Like, for every Rudy
there are 10,000 short guys

02:23.520 --> 02:25.020
who just never make the team.

02:25.022 --> 02:27.689
I'm just saying, if you want
that lunch with the VP.

02:29.026 --> 02:31.193
All right, let's see what we can do.

02:31.534 --> 02:32.694
Oh, look at this.

02:32.696 --> 02:36.064
Colleen1420: Loving this
steps comp! Go Bel-Ridge!

02:36.066 --> 02:38.817
Oh, God. Message received,
you smug skank.

02:38.819 --> 02:40.368
She's a real monster, huh?

02:40.370 --> 02:43.071
Yeah. If I had to choose
between Colleen and Sandra...

02:43.073 --> 02:45.540
well, I mean, I'd kill them both.

02:52.849 --> 02:58.686
All right store 1217,
let's get ready for stepping!

02:58.688 --> 03:01.122
There she is! Speedy leg Sarah!

03:01.124 --> 03:04.859
Let's see them legs go, Girl!
Heather? Hot stepping heather?

03:04.861 --> 03:06.695
Heather with the hot steps?

03:06.697 --> 03:11.299
Freddy! Freddy on fuego! Fuego Freddy.

03:11.301 --> 03:12.834
Mateo, I can see you.

03:12.836 --> 03:14.769
Let's put some hustle in it, baby.

03:14.771 --> 03:19.758
Okay, I don't know what
"this" is but this is cashmere.

03:19.760 --> 03:21.760
So no, I will not be sweating today.

03:21.762 --> 03:25.180
Just take your sweater off!
No, no, sir. Not you.

03:25.182 --> 03:29.000
I was talking to my co-worker.
Please keep your clothes on.

03:30.153 --> 03:33.905
And getting 10,000 steps
a day reduces stress,

03:33.907 --> 03:37.859
it lowers your blood pressure
and increases your lifespan.

03:37.861 --> 03:41.296
Yeah, I don't care. I don't
plan on living past 30 anyway.

03:41.298 --> 03:44.318
30? You're, um, you're under 30?

03:44.818 --> 03:45.815
What?

03:46.570 --> 03:49.337
Nothing. Wow. Yeah. You look good.

03:49.339 --> 03:51.773
Come on, you have to take
this competition seriously.

03:51.775 --> 03:53.642
- I don't think I do.
- God, you're lazy.

03:53.644 --> 03:54.793
Why can't you be one of those

03:54.795 --> 03:56.578
inspirational guys in a wheelchair?

03:56.580 --> 03:58.630
Hm. All right.

03:59.916 --> 04:02.150
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

04:02.608 --> 04:05.403
Are you trying to... I mean,
you're not suggesting

04:05.405 --> 04:07.489
that going backwards
would take away steps.

04:07.491 --> 04:08.957
Of course not. Why would it?

04:09.618 --> 04:12.060
Seriously, stop.
I know it's not happening

04:12.062 --> 04:15.154
it's just that it's a... it's
a safety issue at this point.

04:15.532 --> 04:18.385
Huh. I swear that number
was bigger before.

04:18.719 --> 04:22.149
Fine. I'll just double
my steps to make up for it.

04:23.874 --> 04:24.530
Move!

04:26.910 --> 04:30.508
- Glenn, do you need help?
- Hm? Oh, no I'm fine.

04:30.847 --> 04:34.082
Ah... it's just a little sprain
but I've got to use

04:34.084 --> 04:35.850
this thing all week long.

04:36.418 --> 04:38.853
Still, it's kind of cool, huh?

04:38.855 --> 04:41.055
It's like I'm a motorcycle man.

04:41.057 --> 04:44.559
Yeah, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom.

04:44.561 --> 04:45.974
- So cool.
- Yeah.

04:46.563 --> 04:48.763
Are you sure you got it?
Oh, yeah. Easy peasy.

04:48.765 --> 04:52.724
Just... a bit of a hill here.

04:53.253 --> 04:55.720
Am I... I'm going backwards.
Put your other foot down!

04:55.722 --> 04:57.305
- I can't stop!
- Put your other foot down!

04:57.307 --> 04:59.374
No, I can't! I'm too scared!

04:59.376 --> 05:02.644
We only got a 148 steps
in the last hour?

05:02.646 --> 05:05.680
How is that even possible?
It's shockingly sedentary.

05:05.682 --> 05:07.982
Oh, there she goes again. Colleen1420.

05:07.984 --> 05:11.019
"Everybody's doing great!
Cloud 9 pride!"

05:11.021 --> 05:12.487
Oh, she is the devil.

05:12.489 --> 05:14.356
It's a shame this store
doesn't have a Colleen.

05:14.358 --> 05:16.191
I will burn my face off
if she takes my job.

05:16.193 --> 05:18.643
I just mean, nobody's even
trying because nobody cares

05:18.645 --> 05:21.963
about beating some random store
locations on a scoreboard.

05:21.965 --> 05:23.848
People need a nemesis
to compete against.

05:23.850 --> 05:26.000
So what are you saying?
If we start trash talking

05:26.002 --> 05:27.869
Bel-Ridge that's going
to inspire people?

05:27.871 --> 05:30.739
Maybe. All the best wars
are fought against someone.

05:30.740 --> 05:31.546
That feels random.

05:31.548 --> 05:32.999
All wars are fought against someone.

05:33.001 --> 05:33.971
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

05:33.972 --> 05:35.477
No, I'm saying "all" wars.

05:35.479 --> 05:36.867
Yeah, all the best wars.

05:36.868 --> 05:38.312
What are the best wars?

05:38.314 --> 05:41.666
1812, WWI, WWII, French Indy.

05:41.668 --> 05:44.152
Although, if they started
trash talking us first...

05:44.154 --> 05:47.572
Okay, what wars are you not
fighting against someone?

05:47.574 --> 05:49.324
War against poverty, war against drugs.

05:49.326 --> 05:51.259
- Boom. Don't come at me.
- Come on.

05:57.434 --> 06:01.102
"Ozark Highlands?
More like Slowzark Highlames."

06:01.104 --> 06:04.572
Ouch. I mean,
that's clever but it's mean.

06:04.574 --> 06:08.109
Bel-Ridge1420?
Why is Bel-Ridge attacking us?

06:08.111 --> 06:09.711
Because those guys are dicks.

06:09.713 --> 06:11.379
They always think
they're better than us.

06:11.381 --> 06:13.648
Come on, don't take it personally.

06:13.650 --> 06:16.367
It's just old-fashioned
sports banter like,

06:16.369 --> 06:18.119
"See you at the finish line, slow-poke!"

06:18.121 --> 06:20.238
You know? "And their pear shaped

06:20.240 --> 06:22.390
manager is a real looser."

06:22.392 --> 06:24.917
That's probably supposed to say "loser."

06:25.362 --> 06:27.362
They were most likely in a hurry.

06:27.364 --> 06:29.264
Maybe they should take their time.

06:29.266 --> 06:31.099
Well that is both personal and hurtful.

06:31.101 --> 06:33.368
Ugh, I can't believe
these guys are going to

06:33.370 --> 06:34.903
beat us at the step contest.

06:34.905 --> 06:37.738
It just proves their point
about how slow we are.

06:37.740 --> 06:39.707
- Mm-hmm.
- You know what we should do?

06:39.709 --> 06:42.210
We should all start trying
harder and beat them.

06:42.212 --> 06:44.579
- Oh, shut up, Sandra.
- No, no, no.

06:44.581 --> 06:46.991
Don't shut up, Sandra.
That's a really good point.

06:47.851 --> 06:50.518
Yes, no, sorry.
Yeah, good point, Sandra.

06:50.520 --> 06:52.720
Yeah, let's take it to Bel-Ridge

06:52.722 --> 06:55.590
- and win this whole thing.
- Yeah!

06:55.592 --> 06:57.091
We can do this! Come on!

06:57.093 --> 06:59.144
- Give me a C...
- Oh.

06:59.146 --> 07:00.845
Oh, jeez.

07:00.847 --> 07:03.164
No, no, no, no, no. Don't help him.

07:03.166 --> 07:04.493
He needs to learn.

07:06.614 --> 07:08.748
- Good hustle, Sayid.
- Marcus gave me

07:08.750 --> 07:11.408
six energy drinks. I feel great!

07:11.409 --> 07:12.875
- Great! Keep stepping.
- I can't believe

07:12.877 --> 07:14.443
- how well this is working.
- I know.

07:14.445 --> 07:16.111
I don't want to jinx it
but I'm already thinking up

07:16.113 --> 07:17.630
anecdotes to throw in
at lunch with the VP.

07:17.632 --> 07:19.215
Are you going to tell him
about the time Lionel Richie

07:19.217 --> 07:20.466
- came in the store?
- How does that

07:20.468 --> 07:21.717
- make me look good?
- I don't know.

07:21.719 --> 07:22.656
It's just a cool story.

07:22.657 --> 07:24.286
Man, my heart rate is flying.

07:24.288 --> 07:25.454
I have not stopped moving all day.

07:25.456 --> 07:26.722
Even when I went to the bathroom.

07:26.724 --> 07:27.890
By the way, we need someone

07:27.892 --> 07:29.228
- to clean up the bathroom.
- Great.

07:29.229 --> 07:30.626
Let's keep up the momentum.

07:30.628 --> 07:32.795
- Got it.
- Check. Sandra! Bathroom duty!

07:32.797 --> 07:36.432
Oh, excuse me, sir...
Can I get this in a...

07:36.434 --> 07:39.569
Um, excuse me, do you... do you work...

07:39.571 --> 07:43.539
Great job, Heather.
Walk and fold, walk and fold.

07:44.108 --> 07:45.992
- Mateo...
- Don't even.

07:45.994 --> 07:47.476
I'm not going to get
all gross just because

07:47.478 --> 07:48.995
Bel-Ridge said some dumb things.

07:48.997 --> 07:50.746
Relax, I'm not going to pressure you.

07:50.748 --> 07:53.499
I'm actually really impressed
at how chill you've gotten.

07:53.501 --> 07:55.418
You used to be so competitive
about everything.

07:55.420 --> 07:57.987
Well, I'd like to think
I've matured over the years.

07:57.989 --> 07:59.672
Yeah, totally.

07:59.674 --> 08:01.674
Back when you started you
probably would have been like,

08:01.676 --> 08:04.427
"Ah! When corporate sees how
few steps I'm taking

08:04.429 --> 08:07.029
they're going to think I'm not
the number one worker."

08:07.265 --> 08:09.599
Wait, they can track
our individual scores?

08:09.601 --> 08:11.517
Well, I mean, they
didn't say they could,

08:11.519 --> 08:13.492
but they didn't say they couldn't.

08:13.855 --> 08:17.106
It's fine. Even if you're not,
like, a superstar it's...

08:17.108 --> 08:20.175
it's totally acceptable
to be a everyday,

08:20.177 --> 08:22.344
run-of-the-mill, average worker.

08:22.346 --> 08:25.676
Average? Are you insane?

08:27.035 --> 08:29.531
Damn it. I have to
make up for lost time.

08:29.787 --> 08:31.168
Stop talking to me!

08:33.000 --> 08:39.073
Advertise your product or brand here

08:42.217 --> 08:43.623
Look at me, Jonah.

08:43.835 --> 08:47.202
I'm an MVP player
injured before the big game,

08:47.204 --> 08:49.388
and I'm not even sure that,
like, my tracker

08:49.390 --> 08:51.540
is counting my steps properly.

08:51.542 --> 08:53.226
Maybe you just wanna... you
wanna swing your arm,

08:53.228 --> 08:54.844
you know, at the same time.
What do you mean?

08:54.846 --> 08:58.147
Like, swing your arm as...
as you're... you're moving.

08:58.149 --> 09:00.382
- Like this?
- Yeah, sure and then...

09:00.384 --> 09:02.318
but then use your other hand to steer.

09:02.320 --> 09:04.720
Well I'm trying that,
but that part is hard.

09:04.722 --> 09:06.221
I mean, is this better?
Right-no, mostly.

09:06.223 --> 09:07.417
Or is this worse? I can't tell.

09:07.418 --> 09:09.058
You're doing good, you're just

09:09.060 --> 09:10.559
kinda... you're going around in circles.

09:10.561 --> 09:12.695
Well, I know I'm going
'cause I'm getting dizzy.

09:19.370 --> 09:21.704
Come on people, get off your asses.

09:21.706 --> 09:23.673
If you've got time to
talk you've got time to walk.

09:23.675 --> 09:26.259
When you sit, Bel-Ridge wins, okay?

09:26.261 --> 09:28.094
So let's move. Sandra, if you're looking

09:28.096 --> 09:29.679
for your lunch I put it up on the roof.

09:29.681 --> 09:31.246
That will give you
a couple hundred extra steps.

09:31.248 --> 09:33.215
- Go get 'em, tiger.
- But it's snowing,

09:33.217 --> 09:34.278
and I brought soup.

09:35.553 --> 09:38.054
Elias, I saw one of our carts
down at the gas station.

09:38.056 --> 09:39.605
I need you to walk over there
and take it back.

09:39.607 --> 09:42.224
- Which gas station?
- I don't remember!

09:42.226 --> 09:44.110
Check them all! Go!

09:44.112 --> 09:46.362
Go! Go! Go!

09:47.565 --> 09:49.782
Excuse me, do you have
any gender-neutral toys?

09:49.784 --> 09:50.900
I'm trying to be cool.

09:50.902 --> 09:52.201
Oh, definitely. Follow me.

09:52.203 --> 09:53.235
Oh, wasn't that the toy aisle?

09:53.237 --> 09:55.270
Oops! It was. Passed it.

09:55.272 --> 09:56.789
Guess we have to go all the way around.

10:05.717 --> 10:07.466
How are we still only in fifth place?

10:07.468 --> 10:08.951
Fifth is good, we moved up.

10:08.953 --> 10:10.252
You should be happy.

10:10.254 --> 10:11.804
Oh, what medal do you get for fifth?

10:11.806 --> 10:14.289
Mm? None. What you get
is a slap in the face

10:14.291 --> 10:15.725
and then dad makes you
walk behind the car

10:15.727 --> 10:19.269
- the whole way home.
- I am so sorry, Dina.

10:19.270 --> 10:20.712
We have to find a way
to make these people

10:20.713 --> 10:22.829
- push themselves harder.
- Everybody's already pushing

10:22.830 --> 10:24.896
themselves pretty hard, and most of them

10:24.897 --> 10:26.943
are not wearing deodorant.

10:26.945 --> 10:28.594
- It's bad.
- I'm with Amy on this one.

10:28.596 --> 10:29.895
I think she and I
are just less comfortable

10:29.897 --> 10:30.808
being losers than you are.

10:30.809 --> 10:32.748
I'm just saying we're
on a good track, okay?

10:32.749 --> 10:34.204
No need to overdo it.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.069
I don't know, maybe he's right.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.183
He could be right.

10:39.280 --> 10:41.523
- But he could be wrong.
- That's what I was thinking.

10:41.524 --> 10:43.768
This is just awful.

10:44.472 --> 10:47.041
What is wrong
with the people over there?

10:47.042 --> 10:48.538
This has gone too far!

10:49.594 --> 10:53.048
Yeah. Yeah.
This is definitely overboard.

10:53.049 --> 10:55.617
Are we absolutely sure it was Bel-Ridge?

10:55.618 --> 10:57.282
We could check the security footage.

10:57.283 --> 10:59.510
Sandra, they literally
signed it Bel-Ridge.

10:59.511 --> 11:00.968
What more proof do you need?

11:00.969 --> 11:04.896
They used the wrong
"you're," it's apostrophe R-E.

11:04.897 --> 11:08.277
- Yeah, 'cause they're stupid.
- Or maybe they were tired

11:08.278 --> 11:10.259
or it was dark out. Or whatever.

11:10.260 --> 11:12.269
B-but they were probably just stupid.

11:12.270 --> 11:14.678
Hey, is anyone else tired
of being humiliated by a bunch

11:14.679 --> 11:17.453
of idiots that don't even
understand basic contractions?

11:17.454 --> 11:19.197
- Yeah.
- I am.

11:19.198 --> 11:20.919
You know what we should do about it?

11:20.920 --> 11:22.664
Yeah, report them to the police.

11:22.665 --> 11:24.987
No, no that seems a little bit much.

11:24.988 --> 11:28.551
We should step it up in this
challenge and beat them.

11:28.552 --> 11:29.874
Yeah, enough is enough!

11:29.875 --> 11:32.892
- This just got very personal!
- Mm.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.576
Let's end those sons of bitches!

11:34.578 --> 11:38.864
- Let's destroy Bel-Ridge!
- I am so sick of this [bleep]!

11:45.906 --> 11:47.238
- Sandra?
- Yeah?

11:47.240 --> 11:49.040
Why don't you take your ten now.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.709
- Okay?
- Okay, yeah.

11:52.461 --> 11:57.024
So you got up at 4:00 a.m.,
got spray paint

11:57.025 --> 12:00.311
and shaving cream, came all
the way here to vandalize

12:00.312 --> 12:04.647
our own store, just to get
people to step more?

12:04.649 --> 12:05.898
Nope. 3:00 a.m.

12:05.900 --> 12:07.216
I had to take Parker
to my parent's house.

12:07.218 --> 12:08.718
I told them that Adam had been arrested

12:08.720 --> 12:10.570
- and I had to bail him out.
- I played the impatient

12:10.572 --> 12:12.322
officer who kept calling
Amy saying that she needed

12:12.324 --> 12:13.573
to come get him because he was exposing

12:13.575 --> 12:15.558
- himself to the guards.
- You know,

12:15.560 --> 12:16.892
a part of me feels like you guys are

12:16.894 --> 12:18.528
taking this a little too far.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.363
Hey man, you're the one who was all,

12:20.365 --> 12:22.749
"Let's start a pretend
rivalry with Bel-Ridge."

12:22.751 --> 12:25.368
- "Let's do whatever it takes."
- See, I don't remember

12:25.370 --> 12:27.253
the "let's do whatever it takes" part.

12:27.255 --> 12:32.875
Whew! Hey! Sorry I'm late.

12:32.877 --> 12:33.917
I walked to work.

12:34.245 --> 12:37.170
There is really no easy way
to cross a highway

12:37.849 --> 12:40.383
but I logged 8,000 steps.

12:40.385 --> 12:41.751
Yes!

12:41.753 --> 12:44.086
I'm going to do some laps
around the perimeter.

12:44.088 --> 12:46.674
- Go, Mateo!
- Here we go!

12:47.559 --> 12:49.425
What? He's getting in shape.
It's good for him.

12:49.427 --> 12:50.943
And really, this early there's barely

12:50.945 --> 12:52.528
any cars on the highway.

13:02.440 --> 13:05.541
I'm sending a strongly worded
email to the Bel-Ridge manager

13:05.543 --> 13:09.245
about this morning.
Tell me if it's too mean, okay?

13:09.247 --> 13:11.464
"Good morning, Doug"...
exclamation point.

13:11.466 --> 13:13.966
"I was hoping to discuss
an unfortunate matter

13:13.968 --> 13:15.551
that happened at our store."

13:15.553 --> 13:17.720
Wow, you're really
going for the jugular, huh?

13:17.722 --> 13:19.222
Wha... is that too harsh?

13:19.224 --> 13:21.549
Is a knife through the heart too harsh?

13:21.550 --> 13:23.004
Yes, way too harsh!

13:23.005 --> 13:24.727
Well then maybe you ease into it.

13:24.729 --> 13:27.146
Flatter him a little bit. Butter him up.

13:27.148 --> 13:29.315
Okay, well, what do I say?

13:29.317 --> 13:31.467
All right, just write what I say.

13:31.469 --> 13:33.636
- Thank you.
- "Dear Doug,

13:33.638 --> 13:35.737
I think about you all the time."

13:36.908 --> 13:38.491
- Oh, that is nice.
- Yeah.

13:38.493 --> 13:40.827
"The other day I was at
the mall and I saw a jacket

13:40.829 --> 13:43.913
and thought, 'Doug would look
really great in that.'"

13:43.915 --> 13:45.998
Yeah, but we're going to talk
about the vandalism, right?

13:46.000 --> 13:49.001
Oh, yeah. Oh, we're going
to dive right into it.

13:49.003 --> 13:51.243
Have you heard the new Adele song?

13:51.823 --> 13:54.006
You could just hit... do a simple reset.

13:54.008 --> 13:55.675
Hey, steppy-peeps.

13:55.677 --> 13:58.511
Seeing a lot of the mouths
moving, not so much the feet.

13:58.513 --> 14:01.347
My scanner's not working.
We can't figure out why.

14:01.349 --> 14:03.516
You don't think... wait,
do you think Bel-Ridge

14:03.518 --> 14:05.017
could have messed with it last night?

14:05.019 --> 14:07.306
No... I mean, maybe.

14:07.689 --> 14:11.107
It wasn't broken yesterday,
and it is broken today.

14:11.109 --> 14:12.525
I wouldn't be surprised.

14:12.527 --> 14:14.527
Those guys will stoop
to literally anything.

14:14.529 --> 14:17.313
Oh, my God. I brought a girl
back to my place last night

14:17.315 --> 14:20.032
and after I fell asleep
she stole all my stuff.

14:20.034 --> 14:21.484
Could Bel-Ridge have gotten to her?

14:21.486 --> 14:23.820
Yeah. That has Bel-Ridge
written all over it.

14:23.822 --> 14:26.656
I relapsed and started taking
Vicodin last night.

14:26.658 --> 14:29.542
Well, you know what I like
to do when I'm that angry?

14:29.544 --> 14:32.712
I like to take
all that anger and turn it

14:32.714 --> 14:36.299
into pure raw leg energy.

14:36.301 --> 14:39.218
Just stomp it out. Try it.

14:39.220 --> 14:42.505
Ugh. Just stick it to
Bel-Ridge, you know?

14:42.507 --> 14:44.223
Step it out.

14:44.225 --> 14:45.892
- There you go. Keep going.
- Oh, wow.

14:45.894 --> 14:48.544
When I came to this morning,
somebody from Bel-Ridge

14:48.546 --> 14:50.730
had thrown up all over my entire body.

14:50.732 --> 14:52.841
I can't believe nothing is our fault.

14:58.406 --> 15:00.823
Elias, there is definitely
a cart out there.

15:00.825 --> 15:02.742
Probably just rolled farther
than I thought.

15:02.744 --> 15:04.577
Mateo, have you taken
your lunch break, yet?

15:04.579 --> 15:05.709
No time!

15:05.710 --> 15:07.229
Look, just try walking faster.

15:07.231 --> 15:08.915
It's probably outpacing you.

15:08.917 --> 15:10.416
Hey there.

15:10.418 --> 15:12.835
Can I return an item purchased
at another store?

15:12.837 --> 15:14.253
Yeah, sure, that's not a problem.

15:14.255 --> 15:17.406
Great, I got it in Bel-Ridge.

15:17.408 --> 15:18.925
Are you kidding me?

15:18.927 --> 15:20.927
No.

15:20.929 --> 15:24.580
A frickin' Bel-Ridge lover
wants us to take their garbage?

15:24.582 --> 15:27.917
- No, sir.
- Look, He's laughing at us.

15:27.919 --> 15:29.268
I'm not laughing.

15:29.270 --> 15:31.270
I think he's just, like, a smiley guy.

15:31.272 --> 15:32.688
Thing are getting ugly.

15:32.690 --> 15:35.257
I think we need to
turn down the heat a bit.

15:35.259 --> 15:37.777
No, no, no. You got to keep the heat up.

15:37.779 --> 15:40.196
Hey, you know what?
If you love Bel-Ridge so much...

15:40.198 --> 15:43.237
- Then you should marry it.
- No, dude, I was going to say

15:43.238 --> 15:44.600
then you should just go back there.

15:44.602 --> 15:46.285
Sick burn, though.
You're getting really good.

15:46.287 --> 15:48.103
- Just don't interrupt me.
- It's fine.

15:48.105 --> 15:49.956
It's... it's totally under control.

15:53.251 --> 15:56.929
<i>The Bel-Ridge store was
vandalized last night.</i>

15:56.930 --> 15:58.697
- Ohh.
- Wait, what?

15:58.699 --> 16:00.098
Someone broke into their break room

16:00.100 --> 16:03.385
and covered everything
in hot deer urine.

16:04.263 --> 16:06.204
The smell was so bad
they had to burn their couches.

16:06.206 --> 16:07.205
I got a question.

16:07.621 --> 16:10.654
How did they know it was
deer urine and also hot?

16:10.655 --> 16:12.484
Well, apparently the vandals left a note

16:12.485 --> 16:15.046
next to a Super Soaker they used.

16:15.547 --> 16:17.662
No one here was involved, right?

16:17.823 --> 16:21.642
Uh, no. We totally didn't
cover their entire break room

16:21.670 --> 16:23.321
in steaming hot deer urine.

16:23.323 --> 16:25.907
Okay, it's not that
I think that you're lying,

16:25.909 --> 16:28.827
but your tone and your
phrasing are really weird.

16:28.829 --> 16:31.224
Glenn, come on. Obviously they did it.

16:31.225 --> 16:33.799
Marcus is always bragging about
his Super Soaker collection.

16:33.801 --> 16:35.634
Whatever, Bel-Ridge started it.

16:35.636 --> 16:37.469
What should we do with them next?

16:37.760 --> 16:39.209
Oh, we could go egg their cars.

16:39.211 --> 16:41.528
- Oh, yeah.
- We should slash their tires.

16:41.530 --> 16:42.379
Yeah!

16:42.381 --> 16:44.258
That would just make them walk more.

16:44.259 --> 16:45.606
We should "I, Tonya" them.

16:45.607 --> 16:47.770
Okay, guys. We're even now.

16:47.771 --> 16:49.720
Let's just focus on the steps challenge.

16:49.722 --> 16:51.872
Hey, if they didn't want
to get into a war

16:51.874 --> 16:53.874
then they shouldn't have
started talking trash about us.

16:53.876 --> 16:56.226
- Bingo.
- Well maybe it wasn't them.

16:56.228 --> 16:59.396
Maybe it was actually Kirkwood
who wanted us to think

16:59.398 --> 17:01.690
it was Bel-Ridge so that
we would fight each other

17:01.691 --> 17:02.649
and Kirkwood could win.

17:02.651 --> 17:05.569
What a crazy big
conspiracy that would be

17:05.570 --> 17:08.155
to win a regional workplace
step competition.

17:08.156 --> 17:10.324
Does anyone know how to
make a Molotov cocktail?

17:10.326 --> 17:12.326
Vodka, ginger beer, and lime.

17:12.757 --> 17:14.118
Don't ask me how but I can

17:14.119 --> 17:16.280
totally get us anthrax in two hours.

17:16.281 --> 17:17.998
We should burn down their entire store

17:18.000 --> 17:19.398
and blame it on homeless people.

17:19.401 --> 17:21.709
- Yeah!
- Guys, it wasn't Bel-Ridge!

17:22.588 --> 17:24.171
It was... it was me.

17:24.627 --> 17:25.756
- What?
- Oh, my God.

17:25.758 --> 17:29.009
I am the one who posted
those messages on the board

17:29.011 --> 17:30.577
and vandalized the front of the store.

17:32.748 --> 17:35.933
- Why would you do that?
- I wanted to win.

17:35.935 --> 17:37.821
Amy, Amy, Amy.

17:38.952 --> 17:40.714
This is wildly disappointing.

17:41.307 --> 17:43.023
Dina helped!

17:43.025 --> 17:45.476
Oh, you're going to believe
the admitted liar? Come on.

17:45.478 --> 17:48.428
Wait a minute.
So you made me take deer urine

17:48.430 --> 17:51.315
all the way down to
their store, heat it up

17:51.317 --> 17:53.753
in their microwave and then dump it

17:53.754 --> 17:55.869
all over an innocent couch?

17:55.871 --> 17:57.621
How do you even think of this stuff?

17:57.623 --> 17:59.623
- You're sick, Amy!
- No, I didn't... that wasn't...

17:59.625 --> 18:02.233
- You turned us into monsters!
- Hold up.

18:02.778 --> 18:04.294
Did you also lie about corporate?

18:04.296 --> 18:05.915
Do they not know I'm a superstar?

18:06.465 --> 18:08.678
- They might.
- I haven't slept.

18:09.051 --> 18:10.470
I haven't eaten.

18:10.792 --> 18:13.959
I got clipped by a KIA
on the highway, Amy!

18:14.122 --> 18:16.473
Ugh! Excuse me.

18:16.475 --> 18:18.480
- You look skinny.
- Thank you!

18:27.486 --> 18:29.474
Okay, tell me how this sounds.

18:30.356 --> 18:32.072
- "Dear Doug, I am so sorry..."
- Whoa!

18:32.074 --> 18:35.012
You're going to go there after
the whole deer urine thing?

18:35.327 --> 18:37.552
You might as well just say,
"Deer Urine Doug."

18:37.553 --> 18:39.663
Okay, no "Dear."

18:39.665 --> 18:44.484
- Um, how about, "My..."
- Beloved.

18:44.486 --> 18:48.505
- "Beloved Doug." Yeah.
- Much better.

18:49.208 --> 18:52.759
Oh, boy. People are mad at you.

18:52.761 --> 18:54.595
Well, thanks for having my back, Dins.

18:54.597 --> 18:56.008
Hey, you spearheaded this thing.

18:56.009 --> 18:57.264
Captain goes down with the ship.

18:57.266 --> 18:58.301
Oh, come on. You know what?

18:58.302 --> 19:00.551
Nobody's even thinking about it.

19:01.854 --> 19:03.770
That could be about anything.

19:04.356 --> 19:06.056
You know, I spoke to Glenn
and it turns out

19:06.058 --> 19:09.009
the regional VP has nothing to
do with promoting managers.

19:09.011 --> 19:13.780
So really this whole slide
into fascism was for nothing.

19:13.782 --> 19:15.015
Nah, it was fun.

19:15.017 --> 19:16.349
Excuse me, which was is break room?

19:16.351 --> 19:18.018
- It's just through the doors.
- Thanks.

19:18.020 --> 19:21.371
The worst part about this
is that Colleen wins again.

19:21.373 --> 19:23.189
Seriously, what's the deal
with this woman?

19:23.191 --> 19:25.292
Did she, like, kill somebody you love?

19:25.294 --> 19:27.527
Let's just say the St. Louis
Ornithology Society

19:27.529 --> 19:29.230
is nothing but a popularity contest.

19:29.748 --> 19:31.215
Hey, who was that guy?

19:31.217 --> 19:33.651
Just now? I don't know,
doesn't he work here?

19:33.969 --> 19:35.385
I've never seen him. Have you?

19:35.387 --> 19:37.054
No. Wait, you don't know him?

19:37.056 --> 19:39.292
I mean, you were talking to him
like he was an old pal.

19:39.558 --> 19:41.058
I told him where the break room is.

19:41.060 --> 19:42.392
Yeah, but it was how you said it.

19:42.394 --> 19:43.760
It seemed like it was an inside joke.

19:43.762 --> 19:45.545
- What would be the joke?
- I don't know.

19:45.547 --> 19:48.398
- Between you and that guy.
- Well maybe he's new.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.224
Or, like, from another branch
or something.

19:51.553 --> 19:53.153
Oh, [bleep].

19:53.322 --> 19:55.072
- Whoa.
- What happened in here?

19:55.074 --> 19:57.714
My beautiful break room.

19:58.410 --> 20:00.060
Jerusha made this.

20:00.062 --> 20:03.060
- Amy, why would you do this?
- No, I didn't do this!

20:03.061 --> 20:04.596
This was actually Bel-Ridge.

20:04.597 --> 20:06.617
It's true. I just got a text
from Colleen.

20:06.619 --> 20:10.003
It says, "Clean up on aisle
'your break room."

20:10.005 --> 20:11.062
Damn, she's funny.

20:11.063 --> 20:12.710
- We need to retaliate.
- Mm-hmm.

20:12.711 --> 20:15.575
No, guys. Wasn't this the retaliation?

20:15.577 --> 20:18.244
You hit them, they hit us back.
We're even now.

20:18.246 --> 20:21.348
Uh-uh. We hit them at a four,
but they hit us at a seven.

20:21.350 --> 20:23.473
So now we owe them. Like, three.

20:23.474 --> 20:25.519
But if we get them back
they're just going to get us

20:25.521 --> 20:27.087
back and then where does it end?

20:27.089 --> 20:28.639
When we get them back after that.

20:28.641 --> 20:30.437
He's right.
That's the natural end of this.

20:30.438 --> 20:33.277
Or we could just turn
the other cheek, right, Glenn?

20:33.279 --> 20:35.195
What, so they can slap the other cheek?

20:35.197 --> 20:37.364
No, Amy,
you don't back down from a bully.

20:37.366 --> 20:39.533
I got to agree.
If we don't hit them back

20:39.535 --> 20:41.451
they're going to think
they can walk all over us.

20:41.453 --> 20:43.287
I say we all go over there and destroy

20:43.289 --> 20:44.452
- their break room.
- Yeah.

20:44.453 --> 20:46.773
Let's destroy their whole store!

20:47.993 --> 20:49.960
I think we just got to go

20:49.962 --> 20:51.878
with the mob on this one.

20:53.615 --> 20:57.117
All right, screw Bel-Ridge!
Let's go get those dicks!

20:57.119 --> 20:58.135
Yeah!

20:58.137 --> 20:59.553
Let's escalate this thing

20:59.555 --> 21:01.589
and assume they'll let it go after that!

21:01.590 --> 21:03.071
Yeah, let's escalate.

21:03.072 --> 21:05.559
So should we drive separately
or maybe carpool?

21:05.561 --> 21:07.707
I can drive people there but
I got to go home right after.

21:07.708 --> 21:09.048
Should we get lunch on the way?

21:09.049 --> 21:10.338
Oh, that's a good idea.

21:10.339 --> 21:12.902
My anthrax hookup is not
replying to my text.

21:13.129 --> 21:15.366
Does anybody else have an anthrax guy

21:15.368 --> 21:17.368
Give him a minute, you just texted him.

21:18.305 --> 21:24.481
