00:02.794 --> 00:03.783
BARBIE:
Two weeks ago

00:03.962 --> 00:06.374
an invisible dome
crashed down on Chester's Mill

00:06.548 --> 00:08.459
cutting us off
from the rest of the world.

00:08.634 --> 00:10.966
Why the dome is here
or What mysteries lie ahead,

00:11.136 --> 00:14.549
we still don 't know.
Every day it tests our limits,

00:14.723 --> 00:17.965
bringing out the best
and the worst in us.

00:18.977 --> 00:21.184
Some say
we 7/ be stuck here forever,

00:21.980 --> 00:25.723
but we will never stop ﬁghting
to ﬁnd a way out.

00:26.401 --> 00:27.527
I'm getting e-mail.

00:27.694 --> 00:30.106
The signal's getting stronger.
It's coming from here.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.817
James, I expect you know
that I’m alive.

00:32.991 --> 00:34.982
Talk to Lyle Chum/ey--

00:35.160 --> 00:36.445
No, no. Come on, come on.

00:36.620 --> 00:39.236
She was drowning in the lake.
She just appeared.

00:39.414 --> 00:41.621
I have no idea
where she came from.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.326
You made a promise 25 years ago

00:45.504 --> 00:48.416
to make sure
that what we buried stayed buried.

00:48.590 --> 00:51.172
Looks like Angie got a piece
of whoever did this to her.

00:51.343 --> 00:53.083
Those are the fingertips of a hand.

00:53.262 --> 00:54.877
- Big hand.
- A man's.

00:55.055 --> 00:59.173
Summer '88, Lyle, Sam, Pauline.

00:59.851 --> 01:01.762
What? What is it?

01:02.271 --> 01:04.307
It's me.

01:04.481 --> 01:05.470
REBECCA:
The day is coming

01:05.649 --> 01:07.389
when there won't be enough food
to sustain us.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.775
It may become necessary
to thin the herd.

01:09.945 --> 01:13.813
This is a census to help you decide
who lives and who dies.

01:25.377 --> 01:26.833
Good morning.

01:27.004 --> 01:28.869
Not sure how good it is.

01:29.047 --> 01:32.164
It is if you're using the census
to address our population problem.

01:32.342 --> 01:34.719
Well, gotta see where we stand.

01:34.886 --> 01:36.387
Well, we know where we stand.

01:36.555 --> 01:39.217
We need people who are healthy,
with practical skills,

01:39.391 --> 01:42.849
who give more than they take.
So who's next?

01:43.687 --> 01:45.393
Alice.

01:45.981 --> 01:47.892
She's the first dome baby.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.729
Her mother's Harriet.
She teaches Sunday school.

01:51.903 --> 01:53.359
Uh-huh.

01:55.324 --> 01:58.066
- What else does Harriet do?
- That's it.

01:58.243 --> 02:02.577
She's a single mother.
Woman of faith.

02:02.748 --> 02:06.036
Jim, our food supplies are dwindling.

02:06.293 --> 02:09.581
We can't let these emotions dictate.
It won't be easy--

02:09.755 --> 02:12.292
Listen, I grew up with these people.

02:12.758 --> 02:15.465
l was chosen to lead them.
I'm not gonna shake the tree

02:15.636 --> 02:20.426
until I'm sure who can carry
their own weight and who can't.

02:21.099 --> 02:22.475
But how will you be sure?

02:23.268 --> 02:25.054
I don't know.

02:27.272 --> 02:29.604
Maybe the dome will guide me.

02:30.317 --> 02:32.683
- That's a start.
-Hmm.

02:37.074 --> 02:39.611
- What are you up to?
- Um...

02:39.785 --> 02:41.275
I'm headed to the school.

02:41.453 --> 02:43.819
The windmill power project's
really coming along.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.988
Listen, Rebecca,

02:47.334 --> 02:48.574
we're gonna get through this.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.372
As long as you're leading us.

02:54.424 --> 02:56.415
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

03:02.683 --> 03:04.890
- Are you okay?
- No.

03:09.314 --> 03:12.647
Did Phil ID Angie's killer from the stuff
we found under her fingernails?

03:12.818 --> 03:14.854
That's a dead end.
There's no way to run the DNA.

03:15.237 --> 03:19.355
And half the town probably
has scratches after the magnetization.

03:19.991 --> 03:23.279
Rebecca Pine thinks Chester's Mill
can't sustain itself for much longer.

03:23.453 --> 03:25.159
And she and Jim
wanna use the census

03:25.330 --> 03:27.070
to decide who lives and who doesn't.

03:28.667 --> 03:29.702
Wow.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.616
I know. It sounds crazy.

03:31.795 --> 03:35.003
No. Big Jim's always had
a god complex.

03:35.382 --> 03:38.089
I know they have a plan.
We need to find out what it is.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.592
- We?
- I could use the help.

03:40.846 --> 03:42.461
Where does Barbie stand on all this?

03:43.640 --> 03:45.301
On Jim's side.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.517
Jim.

03:52.399 --> 03:55.891
We need to talk
about your extermination plan.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.818
- Reduction option.
- Okay, whatever. Look.

03:58.989 --> 04:01.105
I know that we need to prepare
for the worst. Okay?

04:01.283 --> 04:04.867
But if that day happens,
I wanna be clear.

04:05.036 --> 04:07.493
No one acts unless we both agree.

04:07.664 --> 04:10.827
Listen, Barbie, I don't want that day
to get here any more than you do.

04:11.334 --> 04:14.167
Look, Chester's Mill couldn't survive
the past few days without you.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.464
The magnets, the crops, the rain.

04:16.631 --> 04:19.919
If we need to take that next step,
we do it together.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.134
Harriet.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.550
There's so many people here.

04:25.724 --> 04:28.306
Makes me feel
like Alice has a family.

04:29.394 --> 04:32.511
Well, that's right. One big family.

04:32.689 --> 04:36.022
We were so lucky to have you
take care of us. Right, Barbie?

04:36.902 --> 04:38.517
That's right.

04:42.991 --> 04:47.826
If this place runs out of food,
let's hope that we're not on the menu.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.289
How can this be?

04:53.627 --> 04:54.958
JOE:
Yearbooks don't lie.

04:55.337 --> 04:58.500
- It's from 25 years ago.
- This is kind of personal,

04:58.673 --> 05:00.459
- but do you have probe marks?
NORRIE: Joe, please.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.842
Save your theory on intelligent life
forms of the universe for a TED Talk.

05:04.262 --> 05:07.880
Explain her memory loss. And the fact
that she hasn't aged in decades.

05:08.058 --> 05:10.640
Maybe the dome sent her.
It sent my mom.

05:11.895 --> 05:13.226
Hey!

05:13.396 --> 05:15.523
No. Melanie's a person.

05:15.690 --> 05:18.397
The dome sent an avatar.
You can't grab an avatar.

05:18.568 --> 05:20.604
Okay, whatever she is,
let's not manhandle her.

05:20.779 --> 05:23.771
And since there's no way
she's actually Melanie Cross,

05:23.949 --> 05:26.440
- then we shouldn't call her that.
- What should we call her?

05:26.701 --> 05:30.489
I should know what my name is.
But I don't.

05:34.501 --> 05:35.536
We should show him.

05:35.919 --> 05:37.500
Yeah, no, the last thing
he wants to hear

05:37.671 --> 05:40.788
is that you found
the fountain of youth in 1988.

05:43.176 --> 05:46.418
Rocking the same clothes
as yesterday.

05:46.596 --> 05:50.214
- Too busy to come home last night?
- Yeah. ls Julia here?

05:50.392 --> 05:53.976
No. She left a note
saying she'd be back later.

05:54.479 --> 05:55.980
What are you guys doing out
so early?

05:56.314 --> 05:59.181
- We need to talk to Julia about--
- Yeah, we got e-mails.

06:00.277 --> 06:02.984
- You got e-mails when?
- Yesterday.

06:03.822 --> 06:05.858
And you're just telling me
about this now?

06:06.241 --> 06:09.483
We all got e-mails
until the signal was blocked.

06:09.661 --> 06:11.276
This popped up.

06:13.790 --> 06:16.076
"This page can't be displayed."

06:16.668 --> 06:18.624
You think the military's blocking us
or...?

06:19.754 --> 06:22.496
That's not the standard response.

06:23.925 --> 06:26.917
We get the signal back, we can
communicate with the outside world.

06:27.095 --> 06:29.051
I want you to take me
where this came through.

06:29.681 --> 06:33.469
LYLE: The devil shall cast some of
you into prison, that you may be tried.

06:34.144 --> 06:36.385
You shall have tribulation ten days.

06:36.563 --> 06:41.728
Be thou faithful unto death
and lwill give you a crown of life.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.858
On your feet, Lyle.

06:46.364 --> 06:47.695
You came to set me free.

06:47.866 --> 06:49.902
My mother said you had answers.
I want them.

06:50.201 --> 06:55.366
Hey, I can do better than tell you,
all right?

06:56.374 --> 06:58.581
I can show you. Let me out.

07:03.882 --> 07:06.464
- Put these on.
- O ye of little faith.

07:06.635 --> 07:08.876
You kidnapped Rebecca
and you tried to kill her.

07:09.638 --> 07:13.222
She was standing
in the way of the Rapture.

07:14.643 --> 07:18.602
If I'm gonna break you out,
I want your hands together.

07:18.772 --> 07:19.807
Think of it as a prayer.

07:23.902 --> 07:26.063
TlLDEN: Thanks for coming over.
REBECCA: How's the piglet?

07:26.488 --> 07:28.444
I think it's a flu.

07:34.996 --> 07:38.079
I'm sorry. It's too late.

07:41.503 --> 07:43.039
I'm worried about the others.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.919
She was a newborn.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.796
The others are strong.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.707
If it's a flu, they'll fight it.

07:48.885 --> 07:52.628
You know people can catch this too.
Are you feeling all right?

07:52.806 --> 07:55.639
I'm fine. So is Beth.
We've been careful about contact.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.390
Good.

07:57.560 --> 07:58.720
Um...

07:58.895 --> 08:00.635
Do you have a wheelbarrow?

08:00.814 --> 08:02.600
No sense touching her more
than you have to.

08:27.090 --> 08:29.581
Everything happens for a reason.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.880
- The Wi-Fi signal's gone.
JOE: Disappeared when we got here.

08:34.305 --> 08:36.091
This was where it was strongest.
Right here?

08:36.266 --> 08:39.884
Yep, because not enough is creepy
about that locker.

08:41.146 --> 08:44.263
I'll have to go find something
to pry this open with.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.272
There's nothing in there.

08:46.443 --> 08:48.855
You don't know that. It's locked.

08:53.908 --> 08:55.284
How did you know
that combination?

08:55.660 --> 09:00.245
I think this was my locker. In 1988.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.666
What?

09:21.102 --> 09:23.434
Okay. What--?
Is this some kind ofjoke?

09:23.605 --> 09:25.345
Played on us by the universe.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.440
Looks like her, huh?

09:31.654 --> 09:34.316
- That doesn't make any sense.
- And the dome does?

09:36.659 --> 09:38.069
You could be this girl's daughter.

09:38.244 --> 09:43.329
Barbie, you know what it's like
to be a stranger here.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.327
I don't wanna be one anymore.

09:45.502 --> 09:48.084
- I'm not sure I can help you with that.
JOE: Why not?

09:48.254 --> 09:52.247
Signal's gone. Help us figure out
who she really is.

09:59.891 --> 10:01.552
Let's go.

10:13.530 --> 10:16.146
Oh, Rebecca likes
to take her work home with her.

10:16.324 --> 10:19.487
Or doesn't wanna be seen
doing it in school.

10:19.661 --> 10:21.367
She's been somewhere
with a lot of muck.

10:28.670 --> 10:31.377
Eggs for breakfast,
blood samples for dinner?

10:31.548 --> 10:33.539
Whatever she's doing,
she's taking precautions.

10:33.716 --> 10:36.549
Yeah, she's got a calendar of when
we run out of food and resources.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.010
She really does think
it's the end of days.

10:43.101 --> 10:45.808
Our science teacher in a prayer group.
That's new.

10:53.945 --> 10:55.276
Huh.

10:55.446 --> 10:59.109
She does have an interest
in one of God's creatures. Pigs.

11:00.076 --> 11:05.161
Blood work, vet books,
mud on the doormat.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.242
There are a few farms around here
with pigs.

11:07.417 --> 11:10.500
Let's see if she paid a visit
to any of them recently.

11:18.803 --> 11:19.792
[LOCK BEEPS]

11:23.600 --> 11:25.261
JIM:
Rebecca?

11:27.228 --> 11:29.059
Hello?

11:30.273 --> 11:32.059
Rebecca?

11:33.484 --> 11:35.611
Working on the windmills?

11:39.282 --> 11:40.943
Rebecca?

11:45.622 --> 11:48.455
We're supposed to use microfilm
in Julia's newspaper office?

11:48.625 --> 11:50.991
Seriously? This is how
they found things in the Stone Age.

11:53.254 --> 11:55.666
No. You just gotta scroll and look.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.547
I miss the Internet.
I miss my cell phone.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.425
I miss texting. I miss sushi.

12:01.596 --> 12:03.678
Well, the Hall of Records
turned up nothing, okay?

12:03.848 --> 12:06.681
This is the last place
that I can think to look

12:06.851 --> 12:08.762
for whatever it is that we might find.

12:08.937 --> 12:12.304
Melanie wasn't in the '87
or '89 yearbooks.

12:12.482 --> 12:13.847
Maybe The Independent
ran an article

12:14.025 --> 12:16.858
about why her family came
to Chester's Mill in 1988.

12:17.028 --> 12:18.734
Or why she left.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.021
In a town where Betsy Van Needles'

12:21.199 --> 12:23.485
record-breaking tomato
makes the front page?

12:23.660 --> 12:26.402
- I'd say we have a pretty good shot.
- Guys, look.

12:30.833 --> 12:33.825
"Melanie Cross went missing
and was never found."

12:34.003 --> 12:37.916
"The family moved to Chester's Mill
from Zenith a short time ago."

12:38.091 --> 12:39.831
Zenﬂh?

12:42.720 --> 12:44.585
That's the same town that I'm from.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.514
I thought you looked familiar.

12:52.438 --> 12:55.145
Melanie's family lived
at 24 Old Oak Drive.

12:55.316 --> 12:58.479
If she remembered the combo when
she stood in front of her locker, then...

12:58.653 --> 13:00.644
She'll remember more
if we take her to the house?

13:00.822 --> 13:05.862
No. No, she won't. Because she's not--
She's not Melanie Cross.

13:06.035 --> 13:07.115
There's just no way.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.575
I wanna go there. I have to.

13:13.835 --> 13:15.416
All right.

13:16.754 --> 13:19.621
What do we say when we barge in
on the family that lives there now?

13:19.799 --> 13:22.165
You let me handle that.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.174
Talk to me.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.010
Tell me how my mother's still alive.

13:30.184 --> 13:31.264
We had a plan.

pilfered corpses,

13:33.688 --> 13:36.805

God rest his soul.

13:37.442 --> 13:39.649
My mother faked her suicide
and you helped her?

13:39.819 --> 13:42.936
- I loved her very much and I still do.
- She abandoned me.

13:43.573 --> 13:45.905
To protect you.
She knew the dome was coming.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.781
The pink stars in the paintings?

13:47.952 --> 13:49.863
She had to get out
before she was taken out.

13:50.038 --> 13:51.448
What does that mean?

13:51.622 --> 13:54.079
Your father had other plans for her.

13:56.127 --> 13:58.413
He has no idea that she's still alive?

13:59.505 --> 14:00.756
No.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.581
What about Sam?

14:03.468 --> 14:06.335
Pauline only trusted me
to help her escape.

14:07.263 --> 14:09.595
What kind of a mother leaves her son
behind in this hell?

14:09.766 --> 14:12.473
I think she thought the dome
would follow her and spare you.

14:12.643 --> 14:14.053
I had to go to her funeral.

14:16.814 --> 14:20.932
She left me here. She left me
to turn into Big Jim Rennie.

14:22.487 --> 14:26.071
Look, your mother trusts me.

but there's nothing on them.

14:47.178 --> 14:48.668
Yeah, there is.

14:48.846 --> 14:50.837
She made those. Turn them over.

14:52.183 --> 14:54.174

Do those look familiar?

15:01.109 --> 15:04.647
This is all the stuff that happened
since the dome came down.

15:05.822 --> 15:09.280
The egg, the butterflies,
the red rain...

15:10.535 --> 15:13.652
If she's out there, how could she
possibly know what's going on here?

than pink stars.

You stole my card, lied to me.
What are you doing, Rebecca?

15:39.564 --> 15:41.850
I'm finding a way.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.811
When the dome first came down,
I started visiting farms,

15:44.986 --> 15:47.853
monitoring crops and livestock.

15:48.156 --> 15:49.817
Tom Tilden had a sick pig.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.190
The flu.

15:54.912 --> 15:56.288
What's inside the eggs, Rebecca?

15:56.873 --> 16:00.240
You said you'd do what it takes
to save this town.

16:00.501 --> 16:03.083
What's inside those eggs
is how you're gonna do it.

16:13.431 --> 16:15.262
Hello?

16:18.811 --> 16:21.268
Left the front door unlocked.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.058
Probably went to the parade
in Westlake

16:23.232 --> 16:24.938

on Dome Day.

- I don't remember anything.

16:44.795 --> 16:47.457
Because there's nothing
to remember.

16:47.924 --> 16:50.336
All I feel is sad.

16:51.052 --> 16:53.714
It sucked having to walk through
my house with my family gone.

16:53.888 --> 16:57.380
And after Angie,
I'm glad the place fell down.

17:05.816 --> 17:08.478
How am I supposed to compete
with a girl he thinks is from a galaxy

But since we're chatting,
what's up with you and Julia?

Come on, you show up
with the "please forgive me" face,

17:24.043 --> 17:26.329
she left before you got there,
so she didn't wanna hear it.

17:26.504 --> 17:29.496
Whatever you did was super bad.
Your eyebrow just twitched.

Oh, my God. I made these.

17:41.852 --> 17:45.219
I used to look out the window
and see them falling.

17:45.481 --> 17:46.596
She saw stars fall?

17:47.024 --> 17:49.140
- They were pink.
- Yeah, over there.

17:49.318 --> 17:50.774
I went out to find them.

That's where we found
the mini-dome.

17:52.863 --> 17:55.320

and changed our lives forever.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.614

I might never know why.

This is a chance to find an answer.
To find one damn answer.

18:05.376 --> 18:08.709
- Even if it's not for me.
NORRIE: I think we should look.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.920
All right. We go to the woods.

Yeah, but according to the farmers,

18:30.735 --> 18:34.227
Rebecca was only monitoring
livestock and crop yields.

18:34.405 --> 18:38.398
She said the point of the town census
was to inventory resources.

18:39.910 --> 18:42.572
- Maybe...
- What?

18:42.747 --> 18:44.237
Maybe she's not planning
anything bad.

No, no, no. You didn't hear
what I heard in her voice.

Or see her douse Lyle

I've misjudged someone.

in the woods for so long,

How long
have you been planning this?

19:31.796 --> 19:33.457
Once everything was ready.

That's why I needed to get in here,

19:36.550 --> 19:39.883
to mix the swine flu
with samples of influenza.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.674
In a few hours the recombinant virus
inside those eggs

19:42.848 --> 19:46.306
will be strong enough
to infect one-quarter of this town.

19:49.355 --> 19:50.470
You wanna release it?

19:50.648 --> 19:53.560
No. I want you to.

of leveling the playing field.

every day.

is in the journal.

a bunch of her stuff after the funeral.

to have herjournal. Not him.

And some jackass killed her
because of it.

you didn't see who pushed you?

28:50.687 --> 28:54.430
It wasn't Pauline.
She was freaking out.
