00:05.673 --> 00:09.086
Zhaan:
I'll see if I can find some
medication for Rygel.

00:16.434 --> 00:20.803
( high-pitched squawking )

00:20.897 --> 00:22.307
Hey, little guy.

00:24.442 --> 00:26.478
Aeryn, check this out.

00:26.569 --> 00:28.059
One critter, two-part harmony.

00:28.154 --> 00:29.269
Trelkez.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.775
Don't get it, then.
Too few heads.

00:31.866 --> 00:33.231
They come with more?

00:33.326 --> 00:35.442
Yeah. The more heads,
the better value they are.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.572
Their brains are the
tastiest part.

00:37.663 --> 00:39.073
(chuckling):
Yeah, right.

00:39.165 --> 00:41.622
Like you'd cook this guy
and eat his brains.

00:41.709 --> 00:44.291
Cook? Never. Raw.

00:46.422 --> 00:49.289
Zhaan:
No, Rygel I haven't found
you any medicine yet.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.372
Hurry up.

00:50.468 --> 00:53.756
I'm very sick. I'm dying.

00:53.846 --> 00:56.633
You only have a touch of
Klendian flu. It's not fatal.

00:56.724 --> 00:59.682
We only wish it were.

00:59.769 --> 01:01.384
I'm suffering here.

01:01.479 --> 01:03.640
(coughing and sneezing)

01:04.941 --> 01:06.556
Your pardon?

01:08.361 --> 01:12.195
| sell jikset root, among other
interesting things.

01:13.449 --> 01:16.156
Then you're a gift from
the Goddess.

01:29.715 --> 01:30.579
( blowing raspberry)

01:30.675 --> 01:32.085
Hey, you with the big feet!

01:32.176 --> 01:33.416
Now do you want a hand
with your problem?

01:33.511 --> 01:36.173
Help's right here and his
name is Haloth.

01:36.264 --> 01:40.303
Thanks, pal, but I think my
problems are a little
out of your league.

01:40.393 --> 01:42.725
Oh, incorrect.

01:42.812 --> 01:47.101
Haloth can fiX up your crummy
life, John Crichton.

01:53.322 --> 01:54.186
How do you know my name?

01:54.282 --> 01:56.898
Ha. I know lots of things.

01:56.993 --> 01:59.279
First, you're dying to
get home to Earth.

01:59.370 --> 02:02.578
Second, there's a Peacekeeper
cruiser hunting you.

02:02.665 --> 02:06.408
Third, you're not
interested, are you?

02:06.502 --> 02:08.413
Oh, well. Sorry to bother you.

02:09.046 --> 02:10.832
HO-ho-hold it!

02:14.593 --> 02:15.799
This is a scam, right?

02:15.886 --> 02:17.797
( chuckling )
Right?

02:17.888 --> 02:21.597
You must have heard Zhaan or
D'argo telling somebody
all this, right?

02:21.684 --> 02:22.969
How could I have
overheard this?

02:23.060 --> 02:24.925
Your mother's maiden name
is McDougall.

02:25.021 --> 02:26.602
You skipped third grade.

02:26.689 --> 02:30.181
And you lost your virginity
to Karen Shaw in the back
of a minivan.

02:30.276 --> 02:32.562
(giggling)

02:33.404 --> 02:34.484
(giggles )

02:34.572 --> 02:37.063
No. It wasn't a minivan.
It was a four-by.

02:37.158 --> 02:39.399
John,John,youTe
grabbing at straws.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.994
Look, what's wrong with
listening to the pitch?

02:41.078 --> 02:43.239
You don't like the product,
you don't have to buy it.

02:46.542 --> 02:47.952
Last chance, Johnny-O.

02:48.044 --> 02:50.501
You want to meet Haloth,
walk this way.

02:51.380 --> 02:52.665
If not...

02:53.924 --> 02:55.460
hit the bricks.

03:12.943 --> 03:17.027
My name is Haloth.

03:18.741 --> 03:22.279
Welcome to my home.

03:24.997 --> 03:26.157
How did I get here?

03:26.248 --> 03:32.710
Oh, the words I need elude
translation's grasp.

03:44.183 --> 03:46.174
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut...

03:46.268 --> 03:49.806
A radiation wave hit and I got
shot through a wormhole...

03:49.897 --> 03:52.434
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship,

03:52.525 --> 03:56.017
a living ship, full of strange
alien life-forms...

03:56.112 --> 03:56.897
Help me...

03:56.987 --> 03:58.238
Listen, please.

03:58.322 --> 04:00.187
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

04:00.282 --> 04:04.742
...being hunted by an insane
military commander...

04:04.829 --> 04:06.945
...doing everything I can...

04:07.039 --> 04:09.416
I'm just looking for
a way home.

04:29.937 --> 04:32.553
Oh, dried gavorkl

04:33.274 --> 04:36.016
Oh, quite aromatic.

04:36.110 --> 04:38.647
Oh, I've never seen
such quality.

04:38.737 --> 04:42.821
I'm honored to be complimented
by a Delvian Pa'u.

04:42.908 --> 04:44.739
Twelfth Level, are you?

04:44.827 --> 04:46.567
Only ninth, I'm afraid.

04:46.662 --> 04:49.199
Ninth is impressive enough.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.869
What's this?

04:54.128 --> 04:55.413
Trellon oil.

04:55.504 --> 04:57.005
Careful with that.

04:57.089 --> 04:57.714
Toxic?

04:57.798 --> 04:59.538
Quite the contrary.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.214
It's a sensual stimulant.

05:01.302 --> 05:04.385
Enriches the conjugal
expenence.

05:05.764 --> 05:08.631
You can vouch for this
personally?

05:08.726 --> 05:12.264
Yes, though it was
some time ago.

05:18.319 --> 05:20.731
It's still potent.

05:20.821 --> 05:24.188
Nonetheless, I suggest you
test it before you buy.

05:24.283 --> 05:25.739
Alone?

05:26.577 --> 05:28.488
As you choose.

05:28.579 --> 05:31.491
But I'm willing to
stand by my products.

05:35.461 --> 05:38.294
Let me see what else you
have to offer.

05:41.217 --> 05:45.677
Okay, you brought me here.

05:45.763 --> 05:46.923
What else can you do?

05:47.014 --> 05:51.849
Alas, I cannot transport
you back to Earth

05:51.936 --> 05:55.474
or act as guide or compass
to that end.

05:55.564 --> 05:59.603
You can't send me home and you
can't even point me in the
right direction.

05:59.693 --> 06:03.732
You are a fugitive pursued
by Crais,

06:03.822 --> 06:06.564
who bears a dark desire
for revenge,

06:06.659 --> 06:10.868
although you did not seek
his brother's death.

06:16.919 --> 06:20.082
Lieutenant Orn:
Captain Crais, all the
marauders have reported in.

06:20.172 --> 06:23.289
They're low on fuel, sir.
They must return.

06:25.302 --> 06:27.634
The marauders will launch the
moment they're refueled.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.303
Captain, the marauders have
been on continuous patrol.

06:30.391 --> 06:32.882
The pilots are so fatigued
that it would be dangerous
to launch...

06:32.977 --> 06:37.266
It's far more dangerous for a
Peacekeeper unable or unwilling
to do his duties.

06:37.356 --> 06:39.221
Do you understand?

06:39.316 --> 06:40.817
Yes, sir.

06:46.907 --> 06:50.991
Captain, priority communication
from High Command.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.410
In my chamber, Lieutenant.

07:06.635 --> 07:09.297
How, how did you...?

07:09.388 --> 07:12.050
Never mind.
How, however you know...

07:12.975 --> 07:14.761
you're right.

07:14.852 --> 07:16.843
But it was an accident.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.929
If I could only tell Crais
that, make him understand.

07:20.024 --> 07:25.360
Oh, that knowledge would dispel
his vengeful thirst.

07:25.446 --> 07:30.190
My talents can provide you
with the means.

07:30.284 --> 07:33.026
I can talk to Crais?

07:33.120 --> 07:34.155
You can set that up?

07:34.246 --> 07:36.908
l'll summon the powers
for this task.

07:36.999 --> 07:39.706
Hey, wait, I got a couple
of questions...

07:45.215 --> 07:48.924
Couple of thousand
more questions.

08:05.736 --> 08:07.647
( beeping )

08:08.322 --> 08:10.108
Captain Crais,

08:10.199 --> 08:14.192
you are to cease your pursuit
of the escaped leviathan
transport.

08:14.286 --> 08:18.279
Withdraw from the Uncharted
Territories at once

08:18.374 --> 08:21.707
and return to First Command
for new orders.

08:21.794 --> 08:26.208
The Council awaits a full
explanation of your failure.

08:33.972 --> 08:37.339
The Admiral wanted you to hear
this in case I refused.

08:37.434 --> 08:40.267
He'd expect me to take over
command in that event.

08:42.481 --> 08:44.847
And would you?

08:44.942 --> 08:46.933
My first loyalty is
to my captain.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.858
And mine is to the Council.

08:48.946 --> 08:51.653
But perhaps I can negotiate
for more time.

08:54.076 --> 08:56.692
Is there any other record
of this transmission?

08:58.038 --> 08:59.278
No.

08:59.915 --> 09:01.200
Dismissed.

09:21.603 --> 09:24.845
My name is Haloth.

09:24.940 --> 09:27.352
Welcome to my home.

09:27.443 --> 09:29.149
What is this place?

09:29.236 --> 09:31.067
Where's my ship?!

09:31.155 --> 09:37.116
Your swift and mighty vessel is
undisturbed, traversing
territories yet unmapped.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.033
Return me at once or die!

09:39.121 --> 09:43.865
I'll not, for first, I'll have
you hear my words.

09:43.959 --> 09:45.495
(yelling)

09:45.586 --> 09:48.703
Before you vainly try
and do me harm,

09:48.797 --> 09:53.962
behold this glimpse of one
whose death you've sworn.

10:00.017 --> 10:01.882
Crichton.

10:08.734 --> 10:10.349
What are you?

10:10.444 --> 10:16.531
A friend, who'll give you
Crichton, for a price.

10:16.617 --> 10:18.778
What price?

10:18.869 --> 10:20.325
Tell me!

10:22.873 --> 10:25.910
Where's Crichton?
He keeps wandering off.

10:26.001 --> 10:29.539
He's over this way.
I can smell him.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.712
Wait. You can smell Crichton
in all of this?

10:31.799 --> 10:34.711
Yes. His odor is even
stronger than yours.

10:34.802 --> 10:36.383
I don't have an odor.

10:45.479 --> 10:47.435
Crichton!

10:47.523 --> 10:48.512
Is he alive?

10:48.607 --> 10:50.768
Get Zhaan. Now!

10:55.489 --> 10:58.151
Haloth:
Oh, dear. Oh, dear!

10:58.242 --> 11:04.829
Friend Crichton, l have news
that you will not like.

11:04.915 --> 11:06.121
No luck, huh?

11:06.208 --> 11:07.664
You couldn't find Crais?

11:19.346 --> 11:22.634
Actually, I found him
quite easily.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.015
Crais.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.322
No obvious injuries.

11:41.410 --> 11:42.741
Could he have been poisoned?

11:42.828 --> 11:44.489
Who on this planet would
want to harm him?

11:44.580 --> 11:45.695
Well, someone has.

11:45.789 --> 11:47.996
( snarling )

11:48.083 --> 11:50.495
This one says that she saw
Crichton entering the dwelling.

11:50.586 --> 11:52.247
He was alone, I swear.

11:52.337 --> 11:54.919
You're lying to me. You saw him
with someone, didn't you?

11:55.007 --> 11:55.587
No!

11:55.674 --> 11:57.164
( snarls )

12:01.430 --> 12:04.137
It was Maldis, wasn't it?

12:05.475 --> 12:08.091
Who is Maldis?

12:08.186 --> 12:09.847
He's not really here. He's a...

12:09.938 --> 12:11.678
he's a hologram, right?

12:12.399 --> 12:14.310
I am here, Crichton.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.481
To talk.

12:15.569 --> 12:17.150
To kill you.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.406
Hey...

12:24.661 --> 12:25.741
Just put that thing down.

12:25.829 --> 12:27.740
l'm.. I'm not going
to fight you.

12:32.628 --> 12:34.414
( both grunting )

12:39.134 --> 12:40.465
Why are you doing this?
We had a deal!

12:40.552 --> 12:43.794
My services have found
a better price.

12:43.889 --> 12:46.676
I'm playing for bigger
stakes now, John.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.928
You can still talk to Crais.

12:49.019 --> 12:51.226
Just don't expect him
to listen!

12:51.313 --> 12:55.431
( cackling )

12:57.110 --> 12:58.816
( screams )

13:01.281 --> 13:04.364
This cut wasn't here before.

13:07.245 --> 13:08.746
Look at this.

13:08.830 --> 13:11.617
Your companion is as
good as dead.

13:12.709 --> 13:15.416
And so are the rest of you.

13:17.381 --> 13:18.336
Is he contagious?

13:18.423 --> 13:20.630
It's not a disease that's
done this.

13:20.717 --> 13:22.503
It's something much worse.

13:22.594 --> 13:25.381
A dark and dangerous force.

13:25.472 --> 13:29.681
Wielded by an evil sorcerer
whose name is Maldis.

13:29.768 --> 13:32.976
He feeds upon pain and death.

13:33.063 --> 13:36.647
Gaining strength by tapping
into the life energy of others.

13:36.733 --> 13:40.317
Maldis invaded our planet and
killed half our population.

13:40.404 --> 13:44.989
We who survive are prisoners
kept alive only at
Maldis's whim.

13:45.075 --> 13:47.657
So this entire planet is
subjugated by one man.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.609
Not a man.

13:49.705 --> 13:55.200
A cruel and malevolent being
who's learned how to transcend
corporeal form.

13:55.293 --> 13:56.749
If you all rose against him...

13:56.837 --> 13:58.452
We'd all die.

13:58.547 --> 14:01.289
I know how invincible Maldis is.

14:01.383 --> 14:04.090
Before he came, I was
a high priest.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.428
You were?

14:07.014 --> 14:10.848
I fought back but my spiritual
powers weren't strong enough.

14:10.934 --> 14:14.643
lt amuses Maldis to keep me
alive in poverty.

14:14.730 --> 14:17.312
He especially likes fresh
victims.

14:17.399 --> 14:19.856
The rest of you will
soon follow.

14:19.943 --> 14:21.729
Not if we leave this
planet first.

14:21.820 --> 14:23.981
You can't escape
Maldis's grasp.

14:24.072 --> 14:28.236
Even in space, hundreds,
thousands of metras away,
he can get at you.

14:28.326 --> 14:29.657
And do what?

14:29.745 --> 14:31.110
This.

14:31.204 --> 14:34.196
He can rip your spirit
from your body.

14:34.291 --> 14:35.906
How can we fight against that?

14:36.001 --> 14:37.707
We can fight.
Where is this Maldis?

14:37.794 --> 14:40.376
He's taken over the complex
at the end of the bazaar.

14:40.464 --> 14:41.954
None of us go near it.

14:42.049 --> 14:45.086
Well, he's done very well to
terrorize primitive people.

14:45.177 --> 14:49.762
Let's go back to Moya get some
weapons and see how he does
against a pair of soldiers.

15:01.276 --> 15:03.608
He'll find you soon, you know.

15:03.695 --> 15:05.196
What the hell are you doing?

15:05.906 --> 15:07.271
He wants to kill me.

15:07.365 --> 15:09.276
No, really?

15:09.367 --> 15:11.028
Fathom that.

15:11.119 --> 15:12.825
Oh, by the way.

15:12.913 --> 15:14.494
My name is Maldis.

15:14.581 --> 15:18.324
But you can address me as
Haloth if you like.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.249
I got a lot of names, John-boy.

15:20.337 --> 15:22.077
Call me whatever pops your cork.

15:22.172 --> 15:23.582
Yeah.

15:23.673 --> 15:25.254
Right.

15:25.342 --> 15:28.379
You're a regular
Laurence Olivier.

15:28.470 --> 15:30.426
Why are you doing this?

15:39.981 --> 15:41.232
What did he offer you?

15:41.316 --> 15:44.774
Much bigger stakes than you can
and the bidding's closed.

15:44.861 --> 15:47.147
Here you are. Here he is.

15:47.239 --> 15:50.026
Now deal with it.

15:53.662 --> 15:55.402
(mocking laughter)
-Damn it.

16:16.226 --> 16:17.466
Rygel:
Looks dead to me.

16:17.561 --> 16:18.721
Don't start, Rygel.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.222
Why did you bring him here?

16:20.313 --> 16:21.519
For safekeeping.

16:21.606 --> 16:23.312
Someone needs to tend to him
if he starts to bleed again.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.186
Shouldn't Zhaan do that?

16:25.277 --> 16:26.813
She says that she is busy.

16:26.903 --> 16:30.236
She's helping by applying some
Delvian mysticism to
the situation.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.985
Well, it doesn't help my
situation, does it?

16:33.076 --> 16:35.032
Or have you forgotten
how sick I am?

16:35.120 --> 16:36.530
This should help.

16:36.621 --> 16:38.236
It is ointment of yuvo.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.447
lt'll help clear your
breathing passages.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.157
D'argo, let's get those weapons.

16:47.591 --> 16:49.582
( sneezes )

16:49.676 --> 16:52.088
There is nothing to be done.

16:52.179 --> 16:54.295
As soon as Maldis is finished
with your companion

16:54.389 --> 16:57.222
he will come after the
rest of you.

16:57.309 --> 16:58.924
We must fight him.

16:59.019 --> 17:02.182
I've already told you.
I'm no match for him.

17:02.272 --> 17:05.014
But what if you and I
combine our powers?

17:05.108 --> 17:07.565
You cultivated your power
to help others.

17:07.652 --> 17:10.359
Can you use it as a weapon?

17:12.824 --> 17:14.815
I can try, if you guide me.

17:14.910 --> 17:17.196
Can you be guided?

17:17.287 --> 17:19.619
It's not just a matter
of skill.

17:19.706 --> 17:21.037
It's intent.

17:21.124 --> 17:25.413
You must want to do harm,
cause pain, even kill.

17:25.503 --> 17:27.880
You are a ninth level Pa'u.

17:27.964 --> 17:30.956
You simply aren't capable
of that.

17:31.051 --> 17:33.758
I once was.

17:37.974 --> 17:39.225
There are no exits.

17:39.309 --> 17:42.142
Save your energy for
fighting Crais.

17:42.229 --> 17:43.514
I'm not playing your sick game.

17:43.605 --> 17:45.971
Maybe you're not, but he is.

17:46.066 --> 17:49.183
Murderer!

18:00.247 --> 18:02.112
Listen to me. I didn't
murder your brother.

18:02.207 --> 18:04.289
You destroyed his Prowler.

18:06.461 --> 18:09.123
Excellent, Crais, now
finish him off.

18:27.983 --> 18:30.599
It was an accident.

18:38.368 --> 18:41.906
Too slow. You missed
yourchance.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.955
(chirping)

18:48.211 --> 18:50.452
Liko:
Your first lesson,

18:51.548 --> 18:53.709
inflicting pain.

19:00.181 --> 19:02.672
(chirping)

19:04.686 --> 19:05.391
Go on.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.810
Hurt the beast.

19:11.109 --> 19:16.729
If you can't inflict pain,
you'll have no chance
against Maldis.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.235
How can you be so sure that
Maldis will come after
the rest of us?

19:19.326 --> 19:23.319
Because you're new, alive
and vital.

19:23.413 --> 19:26.746
Not beaten and depleted like
this planet's population.

19:26.833 --> 19:33.545
Feeding upon all of you will
increase his power unless
you and I stop him.

19:33.631 --> 19:36.293
(sighs)

19:40.138 --> 19:42.220
(wailing)

19:43.391 --> 19:44.801
More.

19:48.438 --> 19:49.894
More.

19:50.982 --> 19:52.438
( screeching )

19:56.738 --> 19:57.773
I can't.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.229
You must.

19:59.324 --> 20:01.280
(sniffling)

20:01.368 --> 20:05.486
You're right, I was once
capable of cruelty,

20:06.623 --> 20:09.080
but now I have evolved
past that.

20:09.167 --> 20:11.078
Evolved?

20:11.628 --> 20:13.164
Try repressed.

20:13.254 --> 20:15.586
You've choked off all your
real emotions.

20:15.673 --> 20:17.254
That's not true.

20:17.342 --> 20:19.333
You think you've smothered your
inner fire and found
enlightenment.

20:19.427 --> 20:22.260
But all you've done is
make yourself cold.

20:22.347 --> 20:24.212
Look at you!

20:24.307 --> 20:27.299
Struggling to contain what
you're feeling.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.851
Fighting to keep control.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.312
What is it you're so afraid of?

20:35.944 --> 20:37.309
I'm not afraid.

20:37.404 --> 20:40.066
Come on. You're terrified.

20:41.699 --> 20:44.315
lam a Delvian Pa'u.

20:44.411 --> 20:47.995
Nothing can frighten me
if! do not wish it.

20:48.081 --> 20:51.790
You can't wish your fear away.
Face it.

20:51.876 --> 20:53.582
Admit what it is you're
scared of.

20:53.670 --> 20:55.285
Are you afraid of Maldis?

20:55.380 --> 20:57.621
You can destroy him.

20:58.883 --> 21:01.465
That's what terrifies me.

21:39.591 --> 21:41.752
Oh, mama!

21:45.930 --> 21:49.138
Sebaceans don't care much
for heat, do you?

21:49.225 --> 21:51.511
Crais, lay off for a minute
and listen to me.

21:51.603 --> 21:54.345
Why? So you can beg
for your life?

21:54.439 --> 21:57.351
So I can tell you why
your brother died.

21:57.442 --> 21:59.433
Tell me then.
Tell me why he died.

21:59.527 --> 22:01.233
First, you tell me something.

22:01.321 --> 22:03.357
My module, the one I
was piloting.

22:03.448 --> 22:05.404
How does it compare
with your Prowlers?

22:05.492 --> 22:09.610
Primitive, no weapons,
no defense shield.

22:09.704 --> 22:11.695
A windup toy, right?

22:11.789 --> 22:15.452
Yet my species is so primitive
we all live on one planet.

22:15.543 --> 22:20.253
l was orbiting it when a
wormhole sucked me
onto your turf.

22:20.340 --> 22:23.047
ldidn't intend it and I'd go
home in a second if I could.

22:23.134 --> 22:26.046
I believe you'd say anything
to save your life.

22:26.137 --> 22:28.799
It's the truth.

22:28.890 --> 22:30.426
You think I attacked
your brother?

22:30.517 --> 22:33.600
Oh, yeah, I popped into the
middle of a giant space battle

22:33.686 --> 22:36.143
and decided to go one-on-one
with a total stranger

22:36.231 --> 22:38.017
in a far superior ship.

22:38.107 --> 22:39.313
Does that make any sense?

22:39.400 --> 22:41.015
You rammed his Prowler.

22:41.110 --> 22:42.270
He ran into me.

22:42.362 --> 22:43.192
You killed him.

22:43.279 --> 22:44.314
It was an accident.

22:44.405 --> 22:45.986
Why do you keep blaming me?

22:46.074 --> 22:49.111
I did everything I could
to avoid him.

22:49.202 --> 22:51.158
Maldis:
Most eloquent, Crichton.

22:51.246 --> 22:53.328
Almost sounded sincere.

22:53.414 --> 22:55.666
It was sincere, you son of a...

22:55.750 --> 22:57.581
But futile.

22:57.669 --> 23:01.787
Let me spread some light
on Crais's hostility.

23:08.304 --> 23:09.714
Father?

23:12.225 --> 23:14.432
How dare you bring
this man here!

23:14.519 --> 23:16.259
Don't worry, Crais.

23:16.354 --> 23:18.345
lwouldn't touch your father.

23:18.439 --> 23:21.272
This is simply an image
from your past.

23:21.359 --> 23:23.065
Bialar!

23:23.152 --> 23:23.902
Tauvo.

23:23.987 --> 23:24.976
Come here, please.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.311
That's right.

23:26.406 --> 23:31.150
Bialar Crais, the acorn,
and the mighty oak.

23:31.244 --> 23:32.450
Maldis!

23:32.537 --> 23:34.493
Remove these images!

23:34.581 --> 23:36.788
It's time, sons.

23:36.874 --> 23:40.366
The recruiter is here
to pick you up.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.827
Stay close to Tauvo.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.662
Give him guidance.

23:44.757 --> 23:47.169
I'm counting on you
to protect him.

23:47.260 --> 23:49.296
Do you understand?

23:52.473 --> 23:53.679
Bialar!

24:02.275 --> 24:03.390
Is that real?

24:04.819 --> 24:07.652
You didn't choose to
be a Peacekeeper?

24:07.739 --> 24:10.151
You and your brother were
shanghaied from your home.

24:10.241 --> 24:11.401
Enough.

24:13.328 --> 24:16.491
We were selected for
Peacekeeper training.

24:16.581 --> 24:18.321
It is a great honor.

24:18.416 --> 24:19.906
Maldis:
Yes, wasn't it?

24:20.001 --> 24:22.413
Just imagine how proud your
father would be

24:22.503 --> 24:26.587
if he knew that his sons both
rose from the ranks.

24:35.475 --> 24:37.636
Officer Tauvo Crais reporting.

24:37.727 --> 24:40.890
It's an honor to be
on board, sir.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.971
Captain's bars suit you,
my brother.

24:43.066 --> 24:44.181
No!

24:44.275 --> 24:45.355
Maldis!

24:45.443 --> 24:46.808
Why are you doing this to him?

24:46.903 --> 24:48.814
Just to jog his memory a bit.

24:48.905 --> 24:51.396
Of course his brother's
current appearance

24:51.491 --> 24:53.356
is more like this.

24:55.411 --> 24:56.491
(yells)

24:59.082 --> 25:00.822
And Crichton did that to him!

25:00.917 --> 25:02.248
(wailing)

25:03.670 --> 25:05.786
Crais:
Stop this.

25:07.382 --> 25:08.918
( screams )

25:16.307 --> 25:19.094
Maldis:
You know what I think, John?

25:19.185 --> 25:22.143
You can talk till your
tongue falls out.

25:22.230 --> 25:24.642
He's going to kill you,
regardless.

25:24.732 --> 25:27.644
( screams )

25:32.281 --> 25:34.408
Aeryn:
Right, let's do it.

25:39.288 --> 25:41.825
This door is protected
by an evil spell.

25:41.916 --> 25:43.497
There's no such thing.

25:43.584 --> 25:46.326
Then why can we not
get through?

25:47.797 --> 25:51.915
Zhaan, the door will not open.
We cannot get inside.

25:52.009 --> 25:57.254
Even if you could, Maldis in
his incorporeal form cannot be
hurt by weapons like those.

25:57.348 --> 25:58.804
Then what can hurt him?

26:00.393 --> 26:02.384
I can.

26:02.478 --> 26:05.595
Oh, well, then, after you.

26:08.234 --> 26:09.735
What are you waiting for?

26:09.819 --> 26:10.934
A third choice.

26:11.028 --> 26:14.270
Though, I know there
are only two.

26:14.365 --> 26:16.196
Let that evil flourish,

26:16.284 --> 26:19.117
or unleash another evil
against it.

26:19.203 --> 26:20.739
How would you choose?

26:23.332 --> 26:26.950
I suppose I would choose
the lesser evil.

26:33.050 --> 26:36.338
Well then, there's no reason
to delay, is there?

26:41.100 --> 26:42.431
Maldis is that way.

26:42.518 --> 26:44.725
But we cannot get through
that door.

26:44.812 --> 26:46.348
Well, we'll keep trying.

27:04.624 --> 27:05.830
Crais!

27:06.793 --> 27:08.283
(grunts)

27:08.377 --> 27:09.833
You can't run forever.

27:09.921 --> 27:11.081
I can wait.

27:11.172 --> 27:13.037
Enjoying yourself, Crais?

27:13.883 --> 27:14.918
Maldis sure is.

27:15.009 --> 27:17.250
He wants us to fight.

27:17.345 --> 27:18.630
You ever wonder why?

27:18.721 --> 27:19.927
I don't care why.

27:20.014 --> 27:21.220
He's feeding off us.

27:21.307 --> 27:22.513
He's drawing energy.

27:22.600 --> 27:25.057
Notice how jazzed up he gets
every time we go at it

27:25.144 --> 27:26.975
and how tired he looks
when we don't?

27:27.063 --> 27:28.974
That's why he showed you
your brother.

27:29.065 --> 27:30.271
Crais...

27:30.358 --> 27:32.394
he's pushing your buttons.

27:34.320 --> 27:38.279
Maldis... doesn't command me!

27:38.366 --> 27:39.446
Don't fool yourself, buddy.

27:39.534 --> 27:41.650
Maldis is your enemy here,
not me.

27:41.744 --> 27:43.405
It won't work.

27:43.496 --> 27:45.111
Nothing can stop me from
killing you.

27:45.206 --> 27:48.289
Look, just listen.

27:49.335 --> 27:51.166
Please, listen.

27:51.254 --> 27:52.790
You're beating yourself up

27:52.880 --> 27:55.917
because you were supposed
to protect your brother.

27:57.260 --> 27:58.875
I understand that now.

27:58.970 --> 28:02.087
And you can believe this
or you can shine it,

28:02.181 --> 28:06.925
but honest to God, I tried
to get clear.

28:07.019 --> 28:10.307
ldidn't mean for him to crash,

28:10.398 --> 28:12.889
and I'm sorry he's dead.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.066
You understand that?

28:16.153 --> 28:17.734
It doesn't matter.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.778
Doesn't matter?

28:19.866 --> 28:21.948
It changes nothing.

28:22.034 --> 28:23.740
Tauvo is dead.

28:23.828 --> 28:29.368
Struck down by a weak,
pathetic, inferior being.

28:29.458 --> 28:31.744
It must be avenged!

28:32.879 --> 28:36.838
I swear in Tauvo's name,
Crichton,

28:36.924 --> 28:40.087
you will die in my hands.

28:40.177 --> 28:41.917
Crais, wait!

28:42.013 --> 28:46.347
Maldis:
You're not nearly as thick
as I thought, John.

28:46.434 --> 28:49.426
You begin to understand
what I'm all about.

28:50.354 --> 28:51.730
Yeah.

28:52.315 --> 28:54.180
You're a vampire.

28:59.697 --> 29:01.107
I admit it.

29:01.198 --> 29:03.450
I feed on death.

29:03.534 --> 29:05.490
But don't we all?

29:05.578 --> 29:08.320
Some eat plants, some, meat.

29:08.414 --> 29:11.451
I consume the life
essence itself.

29:11.542 --> 29:13.453
Preferably medium rare.

29:13.544 --> 29:15.535
So why not just kill us?

29:15.630 --> 29:16.870
Why all the foreplay?

29:16.964 --> 29:19.626
Death is the main course.

29:19.717 --> 29:22.379
All this is the appetizer.

29:25.306 --> 29:27.262
Crais is coming.

29:27.350 --> 29:30.183
Will you run or fight?

29:31.354 --> 29:33.845
I'm getting hungry again.

29:34.941 --> 29:36.397
Breaks my heart.

29:50.790 --> 29:54.248
(mewling)

29:54.335 --> 29:57.202
I apologize for my behavior.

30:04.512 --> 30:06.423
Continue.

30:13.229 --> 30:15.015
Rygel:
Zhaan, where are you?

30:15.106 --> 30:17.347
This goo you sent up
is worthless.

30:17.441 --> 30:19.102
What are you going to
do about it?

30:19.193 --> 30:20.933
Wait.

30:21.028 --> 30:23.064
This is a better lesson.

30:23.155 --> 30:26.818
Zhaan? Zhaan?

30:26.909 --> 30:28.240
Give pain to Rygel?

30:28.327 --> 30:29.908
Zhaan, did you hear me?

30:29.996 --> 30:32.863
I demand you bring me
something that works.

30:32.957 --> 30:36.324
But he's aboard Moya.
I cannot reach that far.

30:36.419 --> 30:39.877
You can with my help.

30:41.590 --> 30:43.376
Why don't you answer me?

30:43.467 --> 30:45.128
What are you doing down there?

30:45.219 --> 30:47.175
Can you find me a
remedy or not?

30:47.263 --> 30:50.096
And if not, why are we
still here?

30:50.182 --> 30:52.719
We should leave this useless
planet immediately

30:52.810 --> 30:57.600
and find a place where I can
get some relief from
this cursed...

30:57.690 --> 31:00.432
(groaning)

31:03.029 --> 31:05.441
( labored breathing )

31:05.531 --> 31:08.443
(groaning)

31:16.375 --> 31:18.366
(sighs)

31:18.461 --> 31:20.918
(sniffling)

31:21.005 --> 31:22.336
(grunts)

31:25.885 --> 31:28.046
Part of me enjoyed that.

31:29.597 --> 31:31.633
We're nearly ready.

31:36.103 --> 31:37.479
Lieutenant Orn:
The captain is incapacitated.

31:37.563 --> 31:39.144
You must remove him and
assume command.

31:39.231 --> 31:40.846
Lieutenant Teeg:
Not while there's a chance
of reviving him.

31:40.941 --> 31:43.523
If you want official
authorization I'll contact
High Command...

31:43.611 --> 31:48.901
There will be no communication
outside this ship unless I
expressly order it!

31:48.991 --> 31:50.856
Dismissed.

31:59.210 --> 32:01.292
We're not giving up.

32:01.378 --> 32:04.745
How can we fight a battle when
the enemy's defenses cannot
even be breached?

32:04.840 --> 32:08.424
We will breach them even if I
have to blast this door down.

32:09.303 --> 32:13.512
Actually, that might work.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.885
If I overload this pulse rifle

32:15.976 --> 32:20.219
then the resulting explosion
should be enough to take out
this entire wall.

32:20.314 --> 32:22.145
It won't work.

32:22.233 --> 32:24.224
It might work.

32:26.153 --> 32:28.439
Can't have that.

32:32.243 --> 32:33.574
What happened?

32:33.661 --> 32:35.322
I don't know.

32:36.330 --> 32:38.787
(hissing)

32:42.711 --> 32:45.248
Crichton:
Captain Bialar Crais?

32:48.175 --> 32:51.417
Let's say you do kill me.
What happens then?

32:52.763 --> 32:57.382
Think Maldis hands you a trophy
and zaps you off to your ship?

32:59.603 --> 33:02.185
What's to stop you from
bringing your Command Carrier

33:02.273 --> 33:05.060
back to the planet and toasting
the whole place?

33:05.151 --> 33:07.312
Think he's going to risk that?

33:09.947 --> 33:11.903
Come on, Crais.

33:12.908 --> 33:14.364
He may not even let you kill me.

33:14.451 --> 33:19.241
He may drag this thing out for
years and then kill us himself.

33:20.916 --> 33:26.252
Is your vengeance satisfied
if Maldis kills me?

33:26.964 --> 33:28.420
No.

33:31.677 --> 33:34.635
Come on, Crais.

33:34.722 --> 33:39.011
Who's your big enemy,
me or Maldis?

33:39.101 --> 33:42.184
Can you put your revenge on hold
and start thinking like
a Peacekeeper?

33:42.271 --> 33:44.353
What do you propose, Crichton?

33:44.815 --> 33:46.396
A truce.

33:46.483 --> 33:48.940
We join forces and nail Maldis.

33:49.028 --> 33:51.519
We can't even lay hands on him.

33:51.614 --> 33:53.570
His power can't be infinite.

33:53.657 --> 33:56.114
He's got to have some weakness.

33:56.202 --> 34:01.322
If we both stay calm and
unemotional, he can't recharge.

34:02.208 --> 34:04.199
We can starve him out.

34:06.170 --> 34:08.126
Come on, Crais.

34:08.214 --> 34:09.624
This may be our best chance.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.330
I agree.

34:12.801 --> 34:14.337
A truce.

34:15.471 --> 34:18.588
My oath as a Peacekeeper.

34:20.309 --> 34:22.300
Good. Truce it is.

34:22.394 --> 34:24.726
Now first question is,
how much power...

34:24.813 --> 34:26.349
(gasps )

34:37.409 --> 34:38.865
(gasps )

34:38.953 --> 34:40.284
(yelling)

34:41.956 --> 34:44.038
(groaning)

34:55.386 --> 34:58.173
Maldis:
What's the matter with
you, Crichton?

34:58.264 --> 35:01.347
Are all the species on your
planet this dim?

35:02.601 --> 35:06.185
It's kill or be killed.

35:22.413 --> 35:25.746
Rygel:
I don't know why I'm bothering.
I don't care what Aeryn thinks.

35:25.833 --> 35:28.040
You certainly look dead to me.

35:28.127 --> 35:31.415
I don't know your customs
for these situations.

35:31.505 --> 35:33.291
Not that I care.

35:33.382 --> 35:37.967
So I'll give you the Hynerian
Ceremony of Passage and
be done with it.

35:38.053 --> 35:40.465
( clears throat)

35:40.556 --> 35:44.094
"John Crichton, valued friend."

35:44.184 --> 35:47.312
Now wait a minute, "valued
friend" is a bit of a stretch.

35:47.396 --> 35:50.729
"John Crichton, unwelcome
shipmate."

35:50.816 --> 35:52.181
Hmm.

35:52.276 --> 35:56.770
"may you have safe transport
to the hallowed realm."

35:58.699 --> 36:00.360
Hmm...

36:06.832 --> 36:09.448
Actually, not our
hallowed realm.

36:09.543 --> 36:11.158
No, that's for Hynerians.

36:11.253 --> 36:13.915
Go find your own
hallowed realm.

36:17.468 --> 36:20.551
With the Ceremony of
Passage complete,

36:20.637 --> 36:23.049
I declare you officially dead,

36:23.140 --> 36:25.802
and claim all your possessions
for myself.

36:29.480 --> 36:31.345
Now...

36:31.899 --> 36:34.436
(grunting)

36:38.405 --> 36:40.361
(groaning)

36:45.204 --> 36:46.569
(grunting)

36:46.663 --> 36:48.790
I'd say you dislocated that.

36:48.874 --> 36:50.956
(gasping)

36:51.043 --> 36:52.499
Happened to you once before,
didn't it?

36:52.586 --> 36:55.623
When you trashed your
motorcycle,

36:55.714 --> 36:58.456
and the only way for you
to get home...

36:58.550 --> 36:59.835
(grunting)

36:59.927 --> 37:02.339
was to pop it in yourself.
Pretty gutsy.

37:02.429 --> 37:04.966
So why do you keep playing
hide-and-seek with Crais?

37:05.057 --> 37:06.342
Take him on!

37:06.433 --> 37:08.264
What's the matter, Maldis?
Blood sugar level getting low?

37:08.352 --> 37:10.684
Need another hit of violence to
kick up the old energy level?

37:10.771 --> 37:12.307
Yes.

37:12.398 --> 37:14.263
I'm getting tired of appetizers.

37:14.358 --> 37:15.723
It's time to dine.

37:15.818 --> 37:17.604
(laughing)

37:17.694 --> 37:20.310
What, is that supposed to
motivate me?

37:20.406 --> 37:21.896
No.

37:21.990 --> 37:23.696
But maybe this will.

37:23.784 --> 37:26.070
Only one of you has to die.

37:26.161 --> 37:27.822
Oh, yeah.

37:27.913 --> 37:31.576
And what's the other one get?
A free trip to Bermuda?

37:32.626 --> 37:35.743
Well, back to your ship anyway.

37:35.838 --> 37:37.920
Believe me, I give you my word.

37:38.006 --> 37:43.126
(laughing)

37:43.220 --> 37:47.179
Like that's worth anything.

37:47.266 --> 37:50.508
It's better that Crais's,
I assure you.

37:55.023 --> 38:00.393
Crais is an animal.

38:01.280 --> 38:03.020
I thought I could reason
with him.

38:03.115 --> 38:05.026
You can't.

38:05.117 --> 38:06.357
It's him or you.

38:06.452 --> 38:09.239
Shh. Shut up.

38:10.372 --> 38:12.363
I've had enough of both of you.

38:14.877 --> 38:16.663
You got 'em.

38:16.753 --> 38:20.917
Tell Crais that I'm
waiting for him.

38:21.008 --> 38:23.340
So you're done talking to him?

38:23.427 --> 38:24.337
Yeah!

38:24.428 --> 38:26.293
All done.

38:32.352 --> 38:36.265
When we reach Maldis,
you must not hold back.

38:36.356 --> 38:39.519
Strike with all our
combined strength.

38:39.610 --> 38:41.726
No hesitation.

38:41.820 --> 38:43.685
No weakness.

38:44.239 --> 38:46.150
No mercy.

38:59.505 --> 39:02.212
The good captain is here.

39:02.299 --> 39:04.460
I'll leave you to it.

39:55.644 --> 39:57.726
(Crichton yelling )

40:46.403 --> 40:47.267
Where's Crais?

40:47.362 --> 40:48.477
I had him.

40:48.572 --> 40:51.109
I returned him to his ship.

40:51.199 --> 40:52.609
Bring him back!

40:52.701 --> 40:54.066
I had him!

40:54.161 --> 40:55.492
Yes, you did.

40:55.579 --> 40:57.194
Took you long enough.

40:57.289 --> 40:59.826
But you finally did
what I wanted.

40:59.916 --> 41:01.167
What you wanted?!

41:01.251 --> 41:03.116
I thought you were hungry.
You wanted death.

41:03.211 --> 41:04.291
I do.

41:04.379 --> 41:06.165
But I'm planning for
the long term.

41:06.256 --> 41:07.496
Bigger stakes, remember?

41:07.591 --> 41:10.207
It's not you or Crais I'm
interested in,

41:10.302 --> 41:13.544
it's that glorious death
machine of his.

41:13.639 --> 41:18.053
Just think what I could do with
a Peacekeeper Command Carrier.

41:18.143 --> 41:22.102
Carnage on a truly
massive scale.

41:29.363 --> 41:31.354
You...

41:31.448 --> 41:34.406
you want him to keep
pursuing me,

41:36.286 --> 41:39.574
so if he brings his ship
within reach...

41:39.665 --> 41:40.996
Absolutely.

41:41.083 --> 41:43.165
He was seriously thinking
of taking it home.

41:43.251 --> 41:44.115
Can you believe that?

41:44.211 --> 41:46.327
But now he'll never turn back.

41:46.421 --> 41:49.834
Deeper and deeper into
Uncharted Territory he'll go.

41:49.925 --> 41:54.794
And sooner or later, that
ship will be mine.

41:54.888 --> 41:56.924
And then...

41:57.891 --> 41:59.131
Damn you!

41:59.226 --> 42:02.343
(Maldis laughing evilly)

42:02.437 --> 42:04.223
Temper, temper.

42:04.314 --> 42:05.975
By the way, John...

42:06.066 --> 42:07.931
l was telling the truth.

42:08.026 --> 42:10.403
One of you has returned
to his ship.

42:10.487 --> 42:15.322
And now, the other has to die.

42:26.420 --> 42:28.285
(groaning)

42:30.298 --> 42:31.708
Die.

42:45.856 --> 42:46.845
John!

42:46.940 --> 42:48.225
I've broken through.

42:48.316 --> 42:50.181
I've made him tangible.

42:55.907 --> 42:58.364
He's all yours now.

43:22.225 --> 43:24.511
(whimpering)

43:24.603 --> 43:25.763
Rygel!

43:25.854 --> 43:28.220
What the hell are you...

43:28.315 --> 43:29.600
what? Where am I?

43:29.691 --> 43:33.309
You... you died down
on the planet.

43:33.403 --> 43:36.361
D-D'argo and A-Aeryn brought
your corpse up here.

43:36.448 --> 43:38.689
And I, l revived you.

43:38.784 --> 43:40.490
Oh, yes, the others...

43:40.577 --> 43:42.613
yeah, they wanted to set
your body adrift.

43:42.704 --> 43:45.787
Uh... but-but I insisted I
could save your life.

43:45.874 --> 43:47.785
And I did.

43:51.505 --> 43:52.870
Course you did.

43:52.964 --> 43:54.955
(laughing)

43:55.050 --> 43:57.006
Oh, it's not Kansas.

43:57.093 --> 44:02.679
And you're way too homely to be
Auntie Em, but come here, Toto.

44:04.434 --> 44:06.766
(laughing)

44:12.984 --> 44:14.360
Liko.

44:19.282 --> 44:21.193
(gasping)

44:24.120 --> 44:28.079
I gave you all I... had.

44:28.166 --> 44:29.497
You're dying.

44:29.584 --> 44:31.324
Let me help you.

44:31.419 --> 44:34.707
You already have.

44:36.007 --> 44:38.043
Maldis is gone.

44:40.637 --> 44:43.674
The price was worth paying.

44:46.142 --> 44:48.133
I only regret...

44:48.228 --> 44:52.221
that you and l...

45:16.965 --> 45:20.173
Crais:
I do not need further
examination.

45:20.260 --> 45:22.125
I'm fully recovered.

45:22.220 --> 45:26.964
Doctor, you will omit this
entire incident from your
medical log.

45:27.058 --> 45:29.435
Your utter failure to diagnose
and treat my affliction

45:29.519 --> 45:31.896
will go unreported and
unpunished.

45:31.980 --> 45:33.845
You're dismissed.

45:35.317 --> 45:37.558
Has there been any communication
with High Command?

45:37.652 --> 45:40.064
Uh, no, sir.

45:40.155 --> 45:44.524
Lieutenant Orn wanted to get
their authorization to
terminate you, sir,

45:44.618 --> 45:47.325
but I overruled him.

45:47.412 --> 45:52.452
Then no one outside this
chamber knows of the
Admiral's orders.

45:52.542 --> 45:54.783
I saw to that, sir.

45:57.839 --> 45:59.375
( neck cracking )

46:04.095 --> 46:07.007
Lieutenant Orn. Status report.

46:07.098 --> 46:10.261
Orn:
All marauders report
negative, sir.

46:10.352 --> 46:12.718
Then widen the search
to dekka three.

46:12.812 --> 46:16.020
Take us deeper into the
Uncharted Territories.

46:16.107 --> 46:17.563
Yes, sir.

46:18.944 --> 46:20.480
Crichton,

46:21.404 --> 46:25.693
I will find you again.

46:32.540 --> 46:34.917
(beeping and squeaking)

46:35.502 --> 46:36.708
D'argo:
Zhaan...

46:36.795 --> 46:38.956
Crichton told us that you two
killed Maldis.

46:39.047 --> 46:42.335
Even in his semi-corporeal
form, Maldis could not
be killed.

46:42.425 --> 46:44.290
But he could be dispersed.

46:44.386 --> 46:46.251
He will coalesce someday.

46:46.346 --> 46:47.552
Zhaan...

46:47.639 --> 46:50.426
I feel I must apologize to you
for mocking your courage.

46:50.517 --> 46:54.430
I see now that you are more of
a warrior than I ever thought.

47:00.860 --> 47:02.725
What is the matter with her?

47:02.821 --> 47:05.278
You called her a warrior.

47:05.365 --> 47:08.823
You could not have cut
her more deeply.

47:11.663 --> 47:12.948
| just don't know, D.K.

47:13.039 --> 47:16.202
Maybe it was always a stupid
thought, but I...

47:16.292 --> 47:19.284
I just figured if could sit
Crais down and talk to him,

47:19.379 --> 47:23.088
I could convince him lwasn't
the murderer he thinks I am.

47:25.385 --> 47:27.626
Well, I had my chance.

47:29.264 --> 47:31.676
And I'm never going to
get another one.

47:33.184 --> 47:36.301
And he's going to keep at it
till one of us dies.

47:40.608 --> 47:42.109
Zhaan.

47:44.988 --> 47:47.980
Well, you look about as
cheerful as I do.

47:49.576 --> 47:51.066
Come on, talk to me.

47:51.161 --> 47:52.241
What's up?

47:53.747 --> 47:57.205
John, before I became
a priest, I...

47:57.292 --> 47:59.328
I was a savage.

47:59.419 --> 48:00.909
Yeah, I think...

48:01.004 --> 48:03.211
I remember you saying that.

48:03.298 --> 48:06.165
I don't know that I ever
beHevedit

48:06.259 --> 48:08.796
You've never seen that
part of me.

48:10.180 --> 48:13.263
I thought I'd eradicated it,
forever.

48:13.349 --> 48:19.310
Well, you resurrected it once,
to deal with Maldis,
so it's over.

48:20.565 --> 48:22.647
No, it's not.

48:23.359 --> 48:26.066
I feel it inside me still.

48:27.072 --> 48:29.563
Now I have to rid myself
of it again,

48:29.657 --> 48:32.399
and I don't know if I can
do it, John.

48:32.494 --> 48:34.985
Well, is there anything
I can do to help?

48:35.080 --> 48:36.991
Aw, come on, there must
be something.

48:37.082 --> 48:39.994
I mean, even if it's just
being a good listener.

48:41.669 --> 48:43.921
No one can help me.

48:49.886 --> 48:52.548
I'm... I'm sorry.
