- Hello, mate.

01:51.570 --> 01:54.904
What's the matter with your
fucking face? You look ill.

01:55.032 --> 01:58.070
Don't start, mate.
I been out all fucking night.

01:58.201 --> 01:59.817

to slow down, don't you?

02:33.111 --> 02:36.024
That's about ten lines in four minutes.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.113
- Is that his?
- Exactly the same stuff.

02:38.241 --> 02:40.574
- 100%?
- One hundred percent.

We got a bag full of readies here.

02:44.081 --> 02:45.413
What sort of readies you talking about?

02:45.540 --> 02:47.452
- Ten large.
- What you want, pills or sniff?

02:47.584 --> 02:50.702
- Pills.
- China Whites, Doves or Burgers?

02:50.837 --> 02:53.204
- China Whites.
- Now be careful of them.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.081
They're a 24-hour buzz
and you'll be out your cunt.

02:55.217 --> 02:56.833
Yeah, that's what we fucking want.

02:56.968 --> 02:58.425
Listen to me, I'm not being rude here.

02:58.553 --> 03:01.387
It's a fucking beautiful boat
but I don't even know you.

We go up them hills
with the bag full of fucking...

03:03.475 --> 03:06.263
Pat. Don't worry,
I can vouch for this geezer.

03:06.395 --> 03:09.638
He's known my dad a long time.
He's a top fella.

03:09.773 --> 03:12.727
Thing you need to know about Harris,
he's got a lot of muscle wrapped around him,

03:12.859 --> 03:14.441
but his gear is fucking kosher.

03:14.569 --> 03:16.856
Don't fuck him over or
you'll be in a lot of trouble.

03:16.988 --> 03:20.902
- You've got a deal.
- Nice doing business.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.276
Cheers, boys. Good health.

Listen this geezer we're gonna meet,

03:34.631 --> 03:36.088
I don't know the full strength of him,

03:36.216 --> 03:38.128
so let me do the talking and sound him out.

03:38.260 --> 03:41.003
Keep schtum, you got me?

04:00.240 --> 04:01.526
Fuck me, who does this cunt think he is?

04:01.658 --> 04:04.492
- Pablo Escobar?
- Fucking thinks he is.

04:12.669 --> 04:13.659
Nice to meet you, Frank.

04:13.795 --> 04:16.378
You've got a beautiful home, I gotta say it.

04:16.505 --> 04:19.464
It's Mr Harris.

04:19.593 --> 04:20.709
Okay.

04:20.844 --> 04:22.756
You're the two hard men I've heard about.

04:22.888 --> 04:24.675
Nice to meet you, Mr Harris.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.547
He looks like he's off for a game of tennis.

04:26.683 --> 04:30.017
Mr Harris, don't worry about us.
We can handle ourselves.

04:30.145 --> 04:32.102
I'm sure you can.
You're the luggage then, eh?

04:35.859 --> 04:37.942
Right, yeah.

04:38.069 --> 04:41.437
Eric and Carl will take care of the details.

04:41.573 --> 04:43.030
I've got to catch a flight for London.

04:43.158 --> 04:46.777
Make yourselves at home. <i>Mi casa es tu casa.</i>

04:59.007 --> 05:00.839
You're Harris's bird, then?

05:02.677 --> 05:04.589
No one owns me.

05:07.307 --> 05:11.426
Well, maybe me and you can, uh,
creep out for a few drinks.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.803
What do you reckon?

05:13.939 --> 05:16.773
I don't think you can afford me.

05:16.900 --> 05:20.143
Well, let me let you into a little secret.

05:20.278 --> 05:22.941
I'm fucking moving up in the world.

05:23.073 --> 05:24.655
Well, let's have that drink when you're up.

05:24.783 --> 05:28.572
Pat, all sorted. Come on, let's fuck off.

05:28.703 --> 05:30.194
I mean it.

05:32.207 --> 05:35.325
See you around. Maybe.

05:44.803 --> 05:48.296
Tell you what, if that gear
is half as good as they say,

05:48.431 --> 05:50.013
we are gonna make a fucking fortune,

05:50.141 --> 05:52.554
knocking them out on the door of the club.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.177
Fucking right, mate.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.023
How'd you fancy a little cheeky one?

05:59.150 --> 06:00.561
Yeah, go on, then.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.776
Have that and we'll have
another one before we go out.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.648
- Cheers, son.
- Cheers.

the anger at boiling point.

Oh, for fuck's sake.
What are you fucking doing?

06:25.468 --> 06:27.050
What's it look like I'm fucking doing?

06:27.178 --> 06:28.134
Alright, calm down.

06:28.263 --> 06:29.470
Just wanna know what
we're doing tonight. That's all.

06:29.598 --> 06:31.590
I'll tell you what
we're fucking doing tonight.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.057
You know what we're fucking doing tonight.

06:33.184 --> 06:35.426
You see that? Fucking pictures
of the fucking queen.

06:35.562 --> 06:39.146
One prostitute. Two prostitutes.
Three prostitutes.

06:39.274 --> 06:41.891
Four prostitutes. Five fucking prostitutes.

06:42.027 --> 06:43.859
Pat, I can't fucking do
five prostitutes, mate.

06:43.987 --> 06:46.070
I ain't interested in you, you cunt.
I'm talking about me.

06:46.197 --> 06:47.278
What I wanna fucking do.

06:47.407 --> 06:50.866
Now, go get me a fucking pill
and liven your fucking self up!

06:54.205 --> 06:57.410
Ken, I love you but you're driving me
fucking mad, you cunt.

06:57.542 --> 06:58.999
# Straight up now tell me

06:59.127 --> 07:03.292
# Do you really want to love me forever

07:03.423 --> 07:06.507
# Or am I caught in a hit-and-run

07:08.136 --> 07:12.426
# Lost in a dream

07:12.557 --> 07:16.176
# I don't know which way to go #

07:16.311 --> 07:19.975
Fuck me, Pat. How do you feel?

07:21.608 --> 07:25.605
I just want a big pair of tits in me face
and a G-string in my mouth.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.607
A fucking million brasses
in here. Just a matter of time.

07:30.742 --> 07:34.281
Oh, mate. I'm fucking buzzing out my cunt.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.159
Hi.

07:38.291 --> 07:41.955
Hello, girls. Fucking hell, perfect timing.

07:42.087 --> 07:44.830
What I have there is the magic partner.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.378
Make you want to do things
you don't want to do.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.171
- Yeah..
- Oh, yeah!

08:18.581 --> 08:21.574
You won't find what you're
looking for in here, darling.

08:21.710 --> 08:23.384
It's in my room.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.419
Think I'm fucking stupid?

08:26.548 --> 08:31.885
Now do yourself a favour
and get the fuck out of this room.

08:32.011 --> 08:36.427
Get the fuck out now!
Fuck off, you little slag!

08:36.558 --> 08:39.722
Pat, Pat, come on, mate. Wake up.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.687
- Come up, mate, get up.
- Oh, mate.

08:42.813 --> 08:46.433
Dirty cunt. Oh, she done me
with a proper pill.

08:46.568 --> 08:48.184
Come on, mate. You alright?

08:48.319 --> 08:50.060
I'm alright, I'm alright.

08:50.196 --> 08:53.530
Listen to me. Go and get them fucking pills.

08:53.658 --> 08:55.445
Give me two minutes to get
changed and have a wash.

08:55.577 --> 08:56.863
Get them fucking pills.

09:07.797 --> 09:10.210
What the fuck do you lot want?

09:10.341 --> 09:13.880
Let me guess, you want
your drugs back and all, right?

09:14.012 --> 09:15.173
That's how we do things in Spain.

09:15.305 --> 09:16.762
Really?

10:07.107 --> 10:09.941
Pat, stop, stop!
You're gonna fucking kill him!

10:13.988 --> 10:16.150
This is how we do things in Essex.

10:30.171 --> 10:33.539
- Jimmy!
- Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.

10:33.675 --> 10:37.043
Ladies! Look at these two.

10:37.178 --> 10:39.135
Alright, boys.

10:39.264 --> 10:41.927
- Fancy a drink?
- What do you fucking think?

10:42.058 --> 10:44.926
- Where's Joss?
- Joss couldn't make it.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.393
- Why not?
- What can you talk to him about

10:46.479 --> 10:49.096
- you can't talk to me about?
- Money?

10:50.817 --> 10:52.934
I thought we were here to talk about drugs.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.561
Well, the two go hand in hand
last time I checked.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.734
We've just acquired a second club.

10:57.866 --> 11:00.233
Gonna need some product to fill it.

11:00.368 --> 11:04.703
So far, we've been happy with you, Jimmy,
so if you fancy the gig, it's yours.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.993
Terry here'll talk about
the wheres and the whens.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.333
- Okay?
- Alright.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.873
No, I'm not fucking alright. You know why?

11:12.005 --> 11:14.543
Because you guys haven't paid me
for that last batch yet.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.791
I thought we explained that to you.

11:16.926 --> 11:19.794
You're investing in the club,
bricks and mortar.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.340
It's way better than cash.

11:21.472 --> 11:23.088
So you want me to take
a couple bricks to the bank,

11:23.224 --> 11:25.307
try and pay my fucking rent with them, yeah?

11:27.812 --> 11:30.976
We told you that this was long term.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.269
Do you want my fucking product?

11:33.401 --> 11:34.687
Cos if the answer's yes,

11:34.819 --> 11:37.106
then you better pay up for the last batch.

11:41.993 --> 11:43.234
Fine.

11:44.537 --> 11:48.030
Meet me and Terry at this address

11:48.166 --> 11:51.750
at 8:00 p.m. tomorrow.

11:51.878 --> 11:56.171
We'll need seven bags and we'll bring you
the money for the last batch we owe you.

11:56.299 --> 11:59.838
- Okay?
- Okay.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.299
'The world was changing.

12:03.431 --> 12:08.051
'Essex was changing. And drugs were changing.

12:08.186 --> 12:10.143
'Punters wanted a buzz
that kept them up all night,

12:10.271 --> 12:12.263
'and puff was fucking old news.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.890
'Even knocking it out wholesale
you'd only double your dough.

12:15.026 --> 12:17.609
'Charlie and pills were the order of the day.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.275
'Jimmy G. was a new kind of dealer.

12:20.406 --> 12:23.570
'He was young, a grafter
with all the right contacts.

12:23.701 --> 12:26.868
'Another geezer we used to knock about with
from time to time was Tony Tucker.'

12:26.996 --> 12:28.282
Controlling the doors.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.701
Control the doors and you control the drugs.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.040
That's where the fucking money is.

12:32.168 --> 12:34.785
The club itself is fucking no use to anybody.

12:34.921 --> 12:37.208
So, what you're actually saying
to me is you want the door

12:37.340 --> 12:39.252
- to our club?
- No, I'm not saying that, mate.

12:39.384 --> 12:41.967
What I'm saying is, I want to work with you.

12:42.095 --> 12:45.304
We can take over the clubs,
take over the doors.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.388
If anybody doesn't like it,
we just fucking smash them.

12:47.517 --> 12:48.758
I know, Tony, but it's a lot

12:48.893 --> 12:50.885
of fucking dangerous mad
people we got to deal with.

12:51.020 --> 12:55.060
Yeah, but I'm a madder, I'm a fucking maniac.

12:55.191 --> 12:58.059
'Tony fancied himself as half a businessman.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.481
'Me and him had done a bit
of debt-collecting together.

13:00.613 --> 13:03.906
'We must have been fucking good at it,
'because every cunt paid up.'

13:08.496 --> 13:10.863
Is your name Jack?

13:10.999 --> 13:15.744
What's going on? No, my name
is Ralphie, this is Joe.

13:15.878 --> 13:19.337
Is this some kind of homophobic attack?

13:19.465 --> 13:22.754
- What'd you say?
- Is there a Jack here, yes or no?

13:24.470 --> 13:27.383
There's a Jack who lives next door.

13:27.515 --> 13:30.474
We buy pills off him every once in a while.

13:32.061 --> 13:33.597
I'm really sorry. We got the wrong address.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.517
This is the wrong gaff. Let's go.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.982
- Sorry about the vase.
- Don't go.

13:41.446 --> 13:44.029
For an extra 20, I'll give you a blow job.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.944
- Whoa, whoa...
- See you.

13:48.161 --> 13:51.370
Listen, Pat, I was gonna
ask you for a bit of a favour.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.864
I'm doing a bit of business
with that Joss and Luke.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.582
I was wondering if you might
be able to come along

13:55.710 --> 13:57.246
- as a bit of security...
- No, no, mate.

13:57.378 --> 13:58.664
But it's not that big a deal.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.708
Just need you to sit in the car
so they can see I'm not alone.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.048
It ain't about that. I gotta
be really fucking careful.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.589
I got that fucking Happy Eater
thing hanging round my neck,

14:05.720 --> 14:07.803
I don't know how it's gonna go.

14:07.930 --> 14:11.469
- What's that all about?
- You don't want to know.

14:12.727 --> 14:15.140
I was out all night on the thing and...

14:15.271 --> 14:18.681
Kate dragged me into a fucking caff for
a fucking coffee and a bacon sandwich.

14:18.816 --> 14:22.651
I ended up bashing up the waiter

14:22.779 --> 14:24.236
and stabbing the manager with a fork.

14:28.159 --> 14:30.822
Get in the car now. Move!

14:32.246 --> 14:34.863
Well, you don't have
to stab anyone with a fork.

14:34.999 --> 14:38.834
I'm literally just dropping off
some gear, picking up the money.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.918
- Come on, then, let's go.
- Cheers, man.

14:57.772 --> 15:00.606
Evening, gentlemen. Going out?

15:02.193 --> 15:03.149
Yeah, why?

15:03.277 --> 15:05.860
Can you step out of the car,
please, both of you?

15:10.451 --> 15:12.909
You mind telling us what's in that bag?

15:13.037 --> 15:14.323
Yeah, it's my gym gear.

15:14.455 --> 15:17.163
Alright well, you won't
mind me taking a look.

15:21.838 --> 15:25.377
Dear, oh dear. What we got in here, then?

15:25.508 --> 15:26.794
Got any other bags of magic in there?

15:26.926 --> 15:28.713
Look, he's got nothing
to do with this, alright?

15:28.845 --> 15:30.552
I was just giving him a lift.
He's fucking clean.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.637
Well, you can both tell us
down at the station.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.176
Come on, then.

15:36.269 --> 15:39.228
Ha-ha! Busted! Was he speeding as well?

15:39.355 --> 15:42.189
Get a fucking proper job, you pig!

15:49.949 --> 15:52.407
You fucking stitched me up,
you Welsh cunt. Didn't you?

15:52.535 --> 15:53.696
You weren't the one who was set up.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.114
I was the one who was fucking set up.

15:55.246 --> 15:56.953
They didn't even know
you were even gonna be there.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.197
I've squared this with the Old Bill.

15:58.332 --> 16:02.918
I told them I would stand up in court and
swear that you had no knowledge of the gear.

16:03.045 --> 16:04.331
Why the fuck would they stitch you up?

16:04.464 --> 16:06.205
Because they owe me
so much fucking money, Pat.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.548
I'm the one who's being screwed over.

16:11.762 --> 16:13.628
I'm warning you, Jim.

16:13.764 --> 16:17.424
Mate or no fucking mate,
if I find out you're fucking lying to me,

16:17.560 --> 16:20.268
I will come after you
and I'll fucking hurt you.

16:20.396 --> 16:23.730
I wouldn't do that, Pat.
I'm not that fucking stupid.

16:34.660 --> 16:38.279
'The way I run my doors
was with zero fucking tolerance,

16:38.414 --> 16:39.700
'and all of my doormen knew

16:39.832 --> 16:41.789
'that anyone throwing
their fucking weight around

16:41.918 --> 16:44.205
'and making themselves busy causing agg

16:44.337 --> 16:46.954
'had to be dealt with lively.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.046
'Because this is my livelihood.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.633
'You try and put your hand
in my fucking pocket

16:51.761 --> 16:53.818
'and I'm gonna fucking tear it off.'

17:00.186 --> 17:01.848
That'll do. Get him up.

17:06.067 --> 17:08.184
I fucking told you before, didn't I?

17:08.319 --> 17:11.983
You do not sell drugs
in this club because we fucking do.

17:12.114 --> 17:14.321
I see you in here again,
you're fucking dead, you got me?

17:14.450 --> 17:16.066
You got me?

17:19.288 --> 17:20.654
Ken, rub him down,

17:20.790 --> 17:23.203
take any gear, any cash
he's got on him, any readies.

17:23.334 --> 17:24.790
I'll see you at the bar after for a booze.

17:24.919 --> 17:27.957
Yeah, no worries, Pat.

17:28.089 --> 17:31.332
Apparently, according to them,
the young kid slipped, fell,

17:31.467 --> 17:34.668
hit his head on the pavement,
that's why he's ended up in the hospital.

17:34.804 --> 17:37.137
'Sam was like a criminal mentor to me.

17:37.265 --> 17:39.678
'He was old school, pulled me
up by my bootstraps

17:39.809 --> 17:42.802
'and went out of his way
to show me what was what.'

17:42.937 --> 17:44.769
So what did happen?

17:44.897 --> 17:46.354
The usual.

17:46.482 --> 17:49.099
Just pikey cunts selling drugs in the club.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.352
We give him the slap, took their gear.

17:51.487 --> 17:54.321
- Pikey, you say?
- Yeah.

17:54.448 --> 17:57.198
Well, at least he ain't gonna say
anything, so the Old Bill are fucked.

17:57.326 --> 17:58.442
If he's a traveller,

17:58.578 --> 18:00.786
they tend to wanna sort
their own problems out.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.451
Sam, forget about it.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.324
You don't understand what
they're like, though, Pat.

18:05.459 --> 18:08.497
There's hundreds of them.
They stick together, they're tribal.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.208
I'm gonna have this and fuck off.

18:14.343 --> 18:17.051
Yeah, sweet, no worries, Pat.
See you tomorrow, yeah?

18:17.179 --> 18:20.763
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Alright, mate.

18:20.891 --> 18:22.098
Oi, Pat.

18:24.228 --> 18:26.595
Here we go, fucking pikeys.

19:03.267 --> 19:05.179
Pikey, fucking pikey cunt!

19:42.390 --> 19:43.972
Ah, fucking hell!

20:13.170 --> 20:16.129
'Half a dozen stitches,
two weeks of fucking work,

20:16.257 --> 20:18.499
'and half of my firm
tucked up in the hospital.

20:18.634 --> 20:22.594
'Now that was the kind of agg
I could not afford.'

20:22.722 --> 20:25.135
I don't fucking like it, Sam.
It's not my way and all it does

20:25.266 --> 20:29.681
- is show fucking weakness.
- Calm down, it's the only way.

20:29.812 --> 20:32.520
Now, I've negotiated it.
It'll be okay, I promise you.

20:32.648 --> 20:35.186
Listen, I can take an army down
in the blink of a fucking eye.

20:35.317 --> 20:36.774
It don't work that way with these people.

20:36.902 --> 20:40.270
I've told you before.
There's hundreds of them.

20:40.406 --> 20:44.820
It doesn't matter how many of them you beat,
they keep coming back. It's endless.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.739
Now go down there, shake the geezer's hand

20:46.871 --> 20:48.612
and that'll be the end of it, alright?

20:48.748 --> 20:51.741
Hello, Pat. How are you, buddy?

20:51.876 --> 20:53.833
What, you want me to come
down there, start playing music

20:53.961 --> 20:56.328
and bring the pipes of peace with me, eh?

21:02.928 --> 21:04.760
Tell your mates to keep
the fucking noise down!

21:04.889 --> 21:06.471
Shut up moaning!

21:11.061 --> 21:12.519
Gypsies!

21:18.778 --> 21:20.110
'Tony brought his pal along.

21:20.237 --> 21:22.274
'A dangerous little cunt called Craig Rolfe.

21:22.406 --> 21:23.522
'He was one of them geezers

21:23.657 --> 21:26.741
'who always fucking opens
his mouth at the wrong time.'

21:48.766 --> 21:50.132
Paddy...

21:51.101 --> 21:53.969
- How's the boy?
- He's okay.

21:54.104 --> 21:55.845
He's out of the hospital.
He's not dead, you know.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.893
'Now, this could go one way or the other.

21:58.025 --> 22:00.768
'Hopefully, we're gonna shake
hands and walk away unscathed.

22:00.903 --> 22:04.772
'If not, this could turn out
to be very, very nasty.'

22:11.413 --> 22:13.780
Well, listen, I just want to say I'm sorry.

22:13.916 --> 22:16.784
No one meant to hurt him. It was an accident.

22:16.919 --> 22:20.458
But you gotta understand, they
were selling drugs in our club.

22:20.589 --> 22:22.751
Usually we just take the gear
and give him a slap.

22:22.883 --> 22:25.125
He went over and he cracked his head.

22:25.261 --> 22:28.174
This is our fucking living.
It's how we earn our money.

22:30.349 --> 22:33.467
Look, I'm here today to make peace.

22:33.602 --> 22:36.436
Let it be gone. Honours even.

22:37.731 --> 22:39.814
Listen, on my boy's life, I shook your hand.

22:39.942 --> 22:43.435
It's forgotten about now.
It's water under the bridge.

22:43.571 --> 22:44.812
I appreciate it.

22:44.947 --> 22:47.564
Yeah, we don't want any more visits.

22:48.242 --> 22:49.449
'Cunt.'

22:49.577 --> 22:52.035
Who the fuck is this little sausage?

22:52.162 --> 22:54.199
He's just along for the ride.
Take no notice of him.

22:54.331 --> 22:55.742
Fuck off.

23:01.171 --> 23:03.333
You trust those fucking pikeys?

23:03.465 --> 23:05.548
Sam said, once they take your hand,

23:05.676 --> 23:08.214
they never ever go back on their word.

23:10.139 --> 23:11.721
Did he call me a sausage?

23:11.849 --> 23:14.557
He did, and you know
why he called you sausage?

23:14.685 --> 23:17.302
- Why?
- Cos you look like one.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.531
Hello, Sammy.

23:37.833 --> 23:38.869
'Joss and Luke.

23:39.001 --> 23:40.412
'You dip your toe in the drug game

23:40.544 --> 23:43.912
'and you gonna find these cunts
hanging off the end of it.'

23:45.341 --> 23:47.424
Well, well, well.

23:47.551 --> 23:50.919
And to what do I owe the pleasure?

23:51.055 --> 23:53.638
We're here to buy you out.

23:53.766 --> 23:56.224
- That right?
- Yeah, that's right.

23:56.352 --> 23:58.059
We'll offer you a fair price
for the business,

23:58.187 --> 24:00.304
and you can step aside.

24:02.024 --> 24:05.893
- Can I?
- Yeah, you can.

24:06.028 --> 24:08.645
Or where do you think you're
getting your fucking drugs from?

24:08.781 --> 24:11.819
Cos ain't you heard? Jimmy's gone.

24:11.951 --> 24:15.410
He got lifted by the Old Bill.
Careless bastard.

24:17.081 --> 24:21.667
My business is worth 300k,

24:21.794 --> 24:25.913
and you two ain't got a pot to piss in.

24:26.048 --> 24:29.462
- So what are you offering me?
- Don't you worry about money.

24:29.593 --> 24:33.553
We're offering you the chance to walk out
of here with the use of your fucking legs.

24:40.771 --> 24:44.606
- What's this?
- It's a contract.

24:44.733 --> 24:47.601
For this place. Just need your autograph

24:47.736 --> 24:51.446
and then you can fuck off down
the red carpet out of here.

24:56.745 --> 24:58.236
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

25:31.071 --> 25:33.233
We're coming back here tomorrow

25:33.365 --> 25:38.076
with this contract signed
or you are a fucking dead man.

25:49.506 --> 25:52.090
'Finally had my day in court
for that Happy Eater turnout.

25:52.217 --> 25:54.334
'Crown Prosecution Service
wanted to put me away

25:54.470 --> 25:56.712
'for a 10-stretch.

25:56.847 --> 25:58.213
'And to be honest with you,

25:58.348 --> 26:00.931
'if I didn't just smash
that half a gram of charlie,

26:01.060 --> 26:03.097
'I'd be fucking shitting myself.'

26:05.189 --> 26:08.523
Kenny boy. What you fucking doing here?

26:08.650 --> 26:11.313
- Got some bad news, Pat.
- What d'you mean?

26:11.445 --> 26:14.358
Thought I'd tell you
in case you went down today.

26:14.490 --> 26:16.903
- Sam's in a really bad way.
- Sam?

26:17.034 --> 26:20.744
He got beaten up badly
last night and he's in hospital.

26:20.871 --> 26:22.112
Who done it?

26:22.247 --> 26:23.488
I think it was that Joss
and Luke and their lumps.

26:23.624 --> 26:24.956
They was banking on you going down today

26:25.084 --> 26:27.918
- so they made their move.
- Pair of cunts.

26:29.296 --> 26:31.208
So, what are you gonna do now?

26:31.340 --> 26:33.081
There's not much we can do without you, Pat.

26:33.217 --> 26:35.083
Listen, look, don't worry
about anything. I'll sort it.

26:35.219 --> 26:37.927
- I ain't banged up just yet.
- Alright.

26:38.055 --> 26:39.967
- Pat Tate?
- Yeah?

26:40.099 --> 26:42.341
I'm Miss Pritchard.
I've been sent to represent you.

26:42.476 --> 26:43.967
Mr Jameson can't make it.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.890
You're fucking joking me, ain't you?

26:46.021 --> 26:48.183
How old are you?
Do you know what you're doing?

26:48.315 --> 26:51.353
I can assure you, I'm extremely
qualified and experienced.

26:51.485 --> 26:53.772
At what? Getting people banged up?

26:53.904 --> 26:56.897
We need to talk now. Mitigation.

26:57.032 --> 27:00.321
I need something so that
I can plead for your defence.

27:00.452 --> 27:03.069
You are looking at
a custodial sentence, here,

27:03.205 --> 27:04.195
and if I have something,

27:04.331 --> 27:06.789
then I can plead for a suspended sentence.

27:06.917 --> 27:10.081
Look, I was out all fucking
night drunk, on pills.

27:10.212 --> 27:11.419
I was on a comedown.

27:11.547 --> 27:12.833
We slipped in there for ten minutes.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.831
She got excited,
put her hand down me trousers

27:14.967 --> 27:16.253
and got her hand around me chopper.

27:16.385 --> 27:18.001
If that mug don't come over and interrupt us

27:18.137 --> 27:20.379
and make himself busy,
then he don't get slapped.

27:20.514 --> 27:23.427
It's as simple as that.

27:23.559 --> 27:27.143
High on drink and pills does
not constitute as a defence.

27:27.271 --> 27:28.807
The sex isn't too much of a worry.

27:28.939 --> 27:30.931
It's the violence that's the problem,

27:31.066 --> 27:32.477
and you have got previous.

27:32.609 --> 27:34.726
Look, I'll tell you what, yeah?

27:34.862 --> 27:37.320
You go in there and you do your best for me,

27:37.447 --> 27:39.359
and if you get me off,

27:39.491 --> 27:41.357
me and you will slip out for a cup of coffee

27:41.493 --> 27:43.860
at the Happy Eater, alright?

27:45.164 --> 27:47.201
So, what the fuck happened?

27:47.332 --> 27:49.824
Oh, mate, he went fucking
mental in the courtroom.

27:49.960 --> 27:52.703
Started smacking everyone.
Coppers, officials.

27:52.838 --> 27:55.376
Then he jumped on the back
of a motorbike and fucked off.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.505
I did tell him about Sam before he went in.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.176
I reckon that's why he flipped out.

28:05.309 --> 28:08.802
- Where is he now?
- Fuck knows?

28:11.648 --> 28:14.641
'I was getting the fuck out of Essex.

28:14.776 --> 28:17.814
'Just had one little stop to make first.'

28:21.909 --> 28:24.822
Sam? It's me, Pat.

28:26.455 --> 28:27.991
Hello, Pat.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.165
Are you alright, how you feeling?

28:33.170 --> 28:35.412
Well, I been better, mate.

28:39.843 --> 28:42.711
Don't move, keep still.

28:44.556 --> 28:48.345
He fucking stamped on my foot.

28:48.477 --> 28:51.641
That's your Sunday football
out the window, innit?

28:51.772 --> 28:54.310
Don't make me laugh.

28:54.441 --> 28:56.023
What happened?

28:58.237 --> 29:02.527
He wanted me to sign my club over to him.

29:02.658 --> 29:05.992
I wasn't gonna sign my club over to him.

29:06.119 --> 29:08.782
Yeah, don't worry about that now.

29:08.914 --> 29:11.122
I'm about and I wanna sort it.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.786
Alright.

29:13.627 --> 29:15.038
That Luke...

29:15.170 --> 29:19.210
- And Joss?
- Yeah, and two other lumps.

29:19.341 --> 29:21.503
'Anyone who puts
their hands on a friend of mine

29:21.635 --> 29:23.797
'is gonna fucking get hit.

29:24.972 --> 29:26.463
Where's your fucking cunt?

29:26.598 --> 29:28.305
He's not fucking coming out tonight.
He's at home.

29:28.433 --> 29:30.846
- Where's he fucking live?
- As if I'd fucking tell you.

29:33.730 --> 29:35.562
Where's he fucking live?

30:08.485 --> 30:09.838
'Oh, yes!'

30:19.067 --> 30:21.309
You took a fucking liberty
with Sam, you cunt.

30:21.445 --> 30:23.732
You are so predictable, Pat.

30:23.864 --> 30:25.321
Shame you got fuck all up there.

30:25.449 --> 30:26.906
You're going away for a very long time.

30:28.201 --> 30:30.193
You dirty, fucking wrong'un cunt.

30:44.176 --> 30:46.839
- You alright, mate?
- Stay with him.

30:58.732 --> 31:00.940
No, I'm still at the office, honey.

31:03.236 --> 31:05.068
Get out!

31:52.536 --> 31:55.449
'So, where do you go
when the Old Bill are onto you

31:55.580 --> 31:58.197
'and you've got no one left to turn to?

31:58.333 --> 32:00.416
'Where do you fucking think?'

32:13.306 --> 32:15.013
Well, here it is.

32:15.142 --> 32:17.475
Apart from the fucking junkyard
and the freezing cold pool,

32:17.602 --> 32:21.061
it ain't half bad, you'll be alright.

32:21.189 --> 32:22.270
Listen, I gotta be honest with you.

32:22.399 --> 32:24.607
It's fucking absolutely perfect. I love it.

32:24.734 --> 32:26.942
Get your nut down and
I'll come see you a bit later.

32:27.070 --> 32:30.939
- It's not bad. See you later.
- See you, son.

32:33.243 --> 32:35.656
Don't forget about me, Tel.

32:42.294 --> 32:43.626
Help!

32:46.339 --> 32:48.331
- Help!
- Down here, right?

33:56.159 --> 33:59.778
- Oi, oi! Alright, son?
- Well, there he fucking is.

33:59.913 --> 34:02.121
- What's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with me?

34:02.249 --> 34:04.491
For starters, you wanna
fucking slow down on that.

34:04.626 --> 34:06.117
What you now, the fucking sniff police?

34:06.253 --> 34:08.040
You have a fucking problem here or what?
I mean, fuck me.

34:08.170 --> 34:10.163
Problem? The only fucking problem
we're gonna have, Tel,

34:10.297 --> 34:12.960
and I mean this now,
sitting here fucking looking at you

34:13.092 --> 34:15.710
and you looking at me with
them silly fucking bins on.

34:15.844 --> 34:17.460
The only fucking problem we're gonna have

34:17.597 --> 34:19.839
is the fact that I've been fucking pugged up

34:19.975 --> 34:22.558
in this cunting gaff staring
at a fucking scrap metal yard,

34:22.686 --> 34:24.723
goats and old fucking bird next door

34:24.853 --> 34:26.971
and that pissy cunting pool.

34:27.107 --> 34:27.972
Tel, you're killing me.

34:28.108 --> 34:31.226
I'm walking around fucking
sniffing, drinking and wanking.

34:31.360 --> 34:32.943
That's all I'm fucking doing.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.937
I begged you to fucking put me to work.

34:35.072 --> 34:36.154
You're taking the piss out of me.

34:36.283 --> 34:37.774
What d'you want me to do?
You fucking flopped to me.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.992
I'm fucking trying my best.
Listen, cop for that.

34:40.120 --> 34:41.952
You start tomorrow.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.743
Come on, son. I get it. I'm sorry, alright?

34:44.873 --> 34:46.239
We'll sort it out.

34:48.878 --> 34:51.245
What have you done to my fucking pool?

34:59.973 --> 35:02.590
# Come on and see me

35:02.726 --> 35:05.469
# I'm a bad man player

35:05.604 --> 35:07.721
# It's gonna take more
than a foot in the heart

35:07.856 --> 35:10.564
# If you're ever gonna kill this soldier

35:10.692 --> 35:13.025
# Actions speak a little louder than words

35:13.153 --> 35:15.440
# I don't suffer fools on Sunday

35:15.572 --> 35:17.780
# I'll probably defer until Monday

35:17.907 --> 35:20.570
# You can say what you say

35:20.702 --> 35:23.115
# Just me as it's use

35:23.246 --> 35:26.034
# Well, did I forget to tell you
Let me tell you now fuck it

35:26.166 --> 35:27.452
# You're so unpredictable #

35:27.584 --> 35:29.576
Hey, have a look at these shit cunts.

35:35.508 --> 35:37.670
Morning, mate. Your name Hans fucking Gruner?

35:37.802 --> 35:39.384
- Yeah.
- You look like a fucking shrunken Adolf.

35:39.512 --> 35:41.629
Where's that cunting money you owe?

35:41.765 --> 35:43.427
# Momma gonna feed you some soul food

35:43.558 --> 35:45.345
# Put your bread on your butter

35:45.477 --> 35:47.969
# Spend some time on his heels

35:48.063 --> 35:50.897
- # Let's get pretty funky
- That's him there.

35:51.024 --> 35:53.141
# Stop singing the blues #

35:55.737 --> 35:58.024
Rats don't like water, you gerbil cunt.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.614
# Did I forget to tell you
Let me tell you now

36:00.742 --> 36:03.610
# Stop it
You're so unpredictable #

36:03.745 --> 36:05.611
And tell your fucking posh mates

36:05.747 --> 36:07.488
down the fucking port selling pills

36:07.624 --> 36:09.456
with no fucking permission,

36:09.584 --> 36:13.077
every bit of money they've had
for the last fucking 18 months

36:13.213 --> 36:14.374
we want.

36:14.506 --> 36:17.923
You seem like a lovely kid but give me
ten fucking lengths, you fat cunt.

36:32.899 --> 36:35.516
# You can say what you want

36:35.652 --> 36:38.144
# Trust me as a tune

36:38.279 --> 36:40.521
# Did I forget to tell you
Let me tell you now

36:40.657 --> 36:42.614
# Fuck it
You're so unpredictable

36:42.742 --> 36:45.234
# I'm a bad man player

36:45.370 --> 36:47.703
# I'm a bad man player, baby

36:47.831 --> 36:49.788
# I'm a bad man player #

36:49.916 --> 36:51.873
Oi! Oi!

36:53.878 --> 36:56.495
What's up, you bollocks?

36:56.631 --> 36:59.624
What are you fucking doing?
I been calling all fucking day.

36:59.759 --> 37:03.002
In bed again with a brass and fucking coke!

37:03.138 --> 37:05.425
Who you talking to?

37:05.557 --> 37:06.923
Where's my fucking money, you cunt?

37:07.058 --> 37:09.641
Who are you talking to, you cunt?

37:09.769 --> 37:11.681
You talking to me like I'm some type of mug?

37:11.813 --> 37:12.678
One of them silly cunts

37:12.814 --> 37:14.555
that works for you down the fucking port?

37:14.691 --> 37:17.274
Coming in here... Fuck off, you cunt!

37:17.402 --> 37:20.277
That fucking money that I fucking
earned, that money's mine.

37:20.405 --> 37:22.613
It's nothing to fucking do with you, right?

37:22.741 --> 37:23.948
We're supposed to be working together, mate.

37:24.075 --> 37:27.614
I'm not your fucking mate.
Get out of my room.

37:27.746 --> 37:28.907
Don't fucking talk to me again.

37:29.038 --> 37:30.574
I fucking eat geezers like you at home.

37:30.707 --> 37:32.323
Fucking eat them!

37:34.169 --> 37:35.779
Get out, you cunt!

37:38.465 --> 37:41.674
You want your money?
There's your fucking money.

37:41.801 --> 37:43.463
But the rest is fucking mine, you cunt.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.177
Now fuck off. Fuck off.

37:48.725 --> 37:49.886
What do you mean? Listen.

37:50.018 --> 37:52.931
You ever tried looking after
a fucking 6'4" psychotic yeti?

37:53.062 --> 37:54.303
Mate, listen, the cunt's gotta go.

37:54.439 --> 37:56.146
I can't have him wrapped around me.

37:56.274 --> 37:57.731
He's a fucking liability.

38:10.038 --> 38:12.030
Oi, remember me?

38:13.082 --> 38:15.165
Hello, Pat.

38:15.293 --> 38:18.786
You fucked me. You and Frank set me up.

38:18.922 --> 38:21.915
We had a blinding thing going
and you had me over.

38:22.050 --> 38:23.837
We had nothing to do with it.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.334
We wouldn't do a thing like that.

38:25.470 --> 38:27.211
Frankie was really mad when
he found out what happened.

38:27.347 --> 38:30.010
- Is that right?
- Yeah, of course it is.

38:30.141 --> 38:33.305
Look, why don't you come with me,

38:33.436 --> 38:35.769
we can unwind, then have that drink.

38:35.897 --> 38:38.014
Frankie gets back tomorrow
and you can straighten it all out.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.607
What do you take me for? Some kind of cunt?

38:40.735 --> 38:42.727
You really expect me to trust you?

38:45.073 --> 38:46.564
Come on, Pat.

39:04.050 --> 39:07.009
Make yourself comfortable.
I'll be right back.

39:07.136 --> 39:09.423
Give me a kiss.

39:09.556 --> 39:12.799
You're a fucking prick tease. Ain't you?

39:12.934 --> 39:14.516
Fucking hurry up.

39:22.735 --> 39:25.603
Pat, the fucking hard man.

39:25.738 --> 39:28.401
Smashes a teenage kid
half to death in Happy Eater.

39:28.533 --> 39:30.570
Makes you a big shot, eh? Gives you respect.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.694
Well, let me tell you, here's different.

39:32.829 --> 39:34.491
This is the big league.

39:34.622 --> 39:36.409
Somebody misbehaves here,
we don't slap them around.

39:36.541 --> 39:37.702
We kill them.

39:37.834 --> 39:41.502
You are very ambitious and that'll
get you killed quicker than anything.

39:41.629 --> 39:46.340
Look, Frank, I'm not trying to kid you, here.

39:46.467 --> 39:48.459
I came here to make up.

39:49.470 --> 39:50.881
I can tell you're not interested,

39:51.014 --> 39:53.722
so get one of them mugs outside
drop me back down the port

39:53.850 --> 39:55.307
and we'll forget everything ever happened.

39:55.435 --> 39:58.844
No, the truth is, Patrick, you fucked
around with a couple of my blokes

39:58.980 --> 40:00.562
and that all turned really fucking nasty.

40:00.690 --> 40:03.148
Them pair of cunts fucking asked for it.

40:03.276 --> 40:05.939
We bought the fucking drugs
and they tried to nick them back.

40:06.070 --> 40:07.151
Are you fucking stupid?

40:07.280 --> 40:09.693
Right now here you don't exist.
You're an alien.

40:09.824 --> 40:11.816
And as far as the fucking
Spanish Old Bill is concerned,

40:11.951 --> 40:14.068
they love it when gangsters
start killing one other.

40:14.203 --> 40:15.614
They don't even bother to investigate.

40:15.747 --> 40:17.238
They couldn't give a flying fuck.

40:17.373 --> 40:20.662
Listen to me, you stupid
fucking arrogant looking cunt.

40:20.793 --> 40:23.160
How about I kill you?

40:23.296 --> 40:25.834
Like you said, I'm doing
Old Bill a fucking favour!

41:04.963 --> 41:07.831
Welcome to Gibraltar, cunt.

41:11.177 --> 41:13.920
'Friends in Spain? Friends in fucking Spain?

41:14.055 --> 41:15.967
'Don't talk to me about
fucking friends in Spain.

41:16.099 --> 41:17.840
'Don't make me fucking laugh!

41:17.976 --> 41:19.012
'As far as I'm concerned,

41:19.143 --> 41:21.635
'the whole country's a fucking
no-good cunting shithole

41:21.729 --> 41:24.767
'and anyone who's in it is
a fucking no-good wrong'un cunt.

41:24.899 --> 41:26.435
'Because what you don't understand, see,

41:26.567 --> 41:28.650
'what you don't understand is loyalty.

41:28.778 --> 41:30.940
'Loyalty and friendship means more to me

41:31.072 --> 41:32.529
'than some fucking sunshine

41:32.657 --> 41:35.570
'and cheap, cock-sucking slaggy brass.'

41:35.702 --> 41:38.615
- Hello?
- Charlotte.

41:38.746 --> 41:41.033
Who do you think it is, you silly cunt?

41:41.165 --> 41:43.248
You fucking had me over. Put Harris on.

41:43.376 --> 41:44.708
Here's not here.

41:44.836 --> 41:47.419
Don't give me that fucking bollocks.
Put Harris on!

41:47.547 --> 41:49.288
Why don't you call back
when you've found your manners?

41:49.424 --> 41:51.461
Listen to me... Back off, wait!

41:51.592 --> 41:53.424
You tell that fucking soapy muggy cunt

41:53.553 --> 41:55.510
I'm coming out there
and I'm gonna fucking get him.

41:55.638 --> 41:57.595
I can't wait to see you too, darling.

41:57.724 --> 41:59.807
What you say? Fucking hold on a minute.

41:59.934 --> 42:04.053
I'm terribly sorry they put you away.
I wish you were here.

42:04.188 --> 42:07.101
You fucking liberty-taking shit cunt.

42:07.233 --> 42:08.599
Don't fucking talk to me like that.

42:08.735 --> 42:10.021
Woman or no fucking woman,

42:10.153 --> 42:12.941
I'll fucking tear your cunting face off!

42:13.948 --> 42:16.031
I told you to wait, you cunt.

42:21.330 --> 42:24.789
'As shit as prison life is,
it does have its perks.

42:24.917 --> 42:27.079
'No booze, no gear.

42:27.211 --> 42:29.999
'Nothing to do all day apart
from lift fucking weights.

42:30.131 --> 42:33.249
'I was getting clean,
back to my fighting weight.'

42:44.437 --> 42:46.599
Alright, Lewis. Message from Mad Dog.

42:46.731 --> 42:49.439
He says you ain't king of fuck all no more!

42:59.577 --> 43:01.819
Stay out of this, Pat.
This is none of your business.

43:01.954 --> 43:04.492
You start killing people in my gym
it's my fucking business.

43:04.624 --> 43:07.287
Your fucking gym?
Who says it's your fucking gym?

43:07.418 --> 43:08.750
I fucking do.

43:25.853 --> 43:28.391
- Cunt, cunt, cunt!
- Enough, enough.

43:28.523 --> 43:31.516
You'll get us fucking nicked. Enough.

43:31.651 --> 43:33.062
Cunt!

43:37.490 --> 43:39.072
'Lewis Hexell was a face.

43:39.200 --> 43:41.192
'He had half the screws on the payroll,

43:41.327 --> 43:44.570
'and he even had the governor
in his back pocket.'

43:44.705 --> 43:46.162
- Lewis.
- Pat.

43:46.290 --> 43:48.202
- Thanks, Pat.
- No worries, son.

43:51.212 --> 43:54.626
I'm not in the drugs business
directly as such.

43:54.757 --> 43:57.757
I can't be dealing with the filth
that control the in and out of the game.

43:57.885 --> 43:59.842
Well, there's a lot of money to be earned.

43:59.971 --> 44:01.963
If you're willing to demean
yourself a little bit more,

44:02.098 --> 44:04.511
but I'm talking fucking bundles.

44:04.642 --> 44:09.182
I think of myself more as a facilitator.

44:09.313 --> 44:10.804
What the fuck's a facilitator?

44:10.940 --> 44:12.681
I put people together.

44:12.817 --> 44:17.061
The right people, if it's in my interest.

44:17.196 --> 44:21.190
Pat... Cop for that.

44:21.325 --> 44:23.863
- How good's that?
- It's pure.

44:23.995 --> 44:28.114
- Are you earning with it?
- I get a lot of money, Pat.

44:28.249 --> 44:30.832
Listen, give me a chance
and I'll get you a fucking lot more.

44:30.960 --> 44:32.451
Alright.

44:32.587 --> 44:34.749
Mickey!

44:34.881 --> 44:36.838
Hey, Lewis. How you doing?

44:36.966 --> 44:39.083
Heard you had a bit
of a problem? You alright?

44:39.218 --> 44:42.336
I'm alright. Thanks to my new friend, here.

44:42.471 --> 44:45.464
- Pat, Mickey.
- How you doing, Pat?

44:45.600 --> 44:46.841
'Mickey Steele.

44:46.976 --> 44:49.389
'He was one of the biggest
importers of drugs in Essex.

'He was also the eyes and
ears of the Hexell brothers.'

44:52.356 --> 44:54.848
Any friend of Lewis's is a friend of mine.

44:54.984 --> 44:57.067
That's good to know.

44:57.195 --> 44:59.312
Listen, thanks for taking
the time to come and see me

44:59.447 --> 45:00.938
in this fucking shithole.

45:01.073 --> 45:04.407
It's nice to see you. It's been a while.

45:04.535 --> 45:07.323
Tony, let me ask you something.

45:07.455 --> 45:08.946
Do you know the Hexell brothers?

45:09.081 --> 45:11.448
Of course. Heavy duty.

45:11.584 --> 45:13.826
Well, I'm in here with Lewis, the older one.

45:13.961 --> 45:15.827
He's just finishing off his holiday.

45:15.963 --> 45:17.625
I got a little bit more bird to do,

45:17.757 --> 45:21.125
then I'm out and then we can
go to work, seriously.

45:22.511 --> 45:26.505
- What kind of work?
- Drugs.

45:26.641 --> 45:29.679
The best fucking quality
you've ever laid your eyes on.

45:29.810 --> 45:32.553
And once this shit is
peddled in the Southend,

45:32.688 --> 45:34.771
no one's gonna go anywhere else for it.

45:37.902 --> 45:41.521
- Ecstasy?
- Yeah, but not normal ecstasy.

45:41.656 --> 45:45.366
- That is pure gear.
- I doubt it.

45:45.493 --> 45:47.485
I'm telling you. Try one.

46:04.136 --> 46:06.753
- Well?
- We need a fucking guinea pig.

46:06.889 --> 46:08.175
What for?

46:08.307 --> 46:10.549
Pat Tate wants us to go into business.

46:13.312 --> 46:14.428
What you think?

46:14.563 --> 46:18.182
I mean, he's in fucking prison,
so it ain't a good start.

46:18.317 --> 46:21.776
- Fuck it, I'm gonna take one.
- What the fuck you doing?

46:21.904 --> 46:24.612
We know nothing about those fucking pills.

46:24.740 --> 46:26.823
Fuck's wrong with you?
How you gonna drive the motor

46:26.951 --> 46:28.658
when that shit kicks in, you silly cunt?

46:28.786 --> 46:32.120
Fucking ecstasy, Tone. It ain't fucking scag.

46:32.248 --> 46:34.581
I could take this and fly a fucking plane,

46:34.709 --> 46:36.826
with me balls getting sucked
at the same time.

46:38.421 --> 46:42.256
# Everybody wants to be somebody

46:42.383 --> 46:45.091
# Everybody

46:45.219 --> 46:47.085
# Needs somebody

46:47.221 --> 46:50.635
# Everybody be somebody #

46:56.230 --> 46:58.142
Oh, fuck it.

47:04.572 --> 47:07.315
- Wanna chip?
- No.

47:07.450 --> 47:09.487
No, fuck the chips!

47:09.618 --> 47:12.736
- Fucking Jesus.
- Want some cheese?

47:12.872 --> 47:16.616
You're some sort of cunt,
ain't you? Talking to me?

47:16.751 --> 47:19.459
You're off your fucking nut!

47:19.587 --> 47:21.328
It's kicking in then, yeah?

47:21.464 --> 47:23.421
I don't even wanna fucking come down.

47:23.549 --> 47:24.756
Fucking have it!

47:27.511 --> 47:31.095
Serious. No, listen to me.
Educate me, Mick, please.

47:31.223 --> 47:33.180
I wanna know about
this fucking drug running game.

47:33.309 --> 47:37.053
Well, Jack here,
he organizes all the permits,

47:37.188 --> 47:39.396
the paperwork that gets us into Holland.

47:39.523 --> 47:41.890
'Looks after the boat,
makes sure it runs sweet.

47:42.026 --> 47:43.517
'All the bits and pieces, you know?'

47:43.652 --> 47:45.735
- I'm the details man.
- Yeah.

47:45.863 --> 47:49.527
Without details, Pat, you end up
all at sea, literally, right?

47:49.658 --> 47:51.866
Turns you into a weather-obsessive,

47:51.994 --> 47:56.534
cos it can turn from a millpond
into a Force-8 just like that.

47:56.665 --> 47:58.076
Hold on a minute.

48:00.753 --> 48:04.497
- Jimmy fucking G.
- Fucking hell, Pat.

48:04.632 --> 48:07.045
What are you doing here?

48:08.552 --> 48:11.511
You remember that fucking thing
with that Joss and Luke?

48:11.639 --> 48:14.928
Well, it turns out I was fucking right.
They set me up.

48:15.059 --> 48:16.971
So how long you got to go?

48:17.103 --> 48:20.183
Two months, three weeks,
couple of days and a few naughty hours.

48:20.314 --> 48:21.395
You got a fucking result, mate.

48:21.524 --> 48:22.856
You'll be out before you know it.

48:22.983 --> 48:24.019
Hey, look.

48:24.151 --> 48:27.519
I don't know if you know,
but that Joss's firm,

48:27.655 --> 48:30.398
he's looking at taking over
all of the fucking clubs on the strip.

48:30.533 --> 48:33.071
They're gonna monopolize on everything.

48:33.202 --> 48:35.660
Yeah, but that just depends
on one thing, doesn't it?

48:35.788 --> 48:37.495
How much muscle they got wrapped around them.

48:37.623 --> 48:40.787
Well, they're pretty fucking
heavy duty by all accounts.

48:40.918 --> 48:42.705
That's fixable.

48:43.838 --> 48:46.626
Pat... What cell you in?

48:46.757 --> 48:49.295
On D wing, last cell at the end on the ones.

48:51.762 --> 48:54.049
Listen, we got some agg down in Southend.

48:54.181 --> 48:56.264
A couple of geezers making
theirselves fucking busy,

48:56.392 --> 48:59.351
trying to muscle in
and ruin the party for everyone.

48:59.478 --> 49:01.720
This is gonna affect us all, Mick.

49:01.856 --> 49:07.102
Yeah, well, the loud ones
never last, Pat. You know that.

49:09.488 --> 49:11.480
Fucking blown.

49:13.784 --> 49:16.527
Joss, some geezer wants a word.

49:18.873 --> 49:21.035
- You alright?
- You look nervous. What's up?

49:21.167 --> 49:23.204
My boy, seems he stole some drugs,

49:23.335 --> 49:24.621
a bag of pills or something.

49:24.753 --> 49:26.585
I don't know, I don't
understand all these things,

49:26.714 --> 49:28.080
but I do know he shouldn't have.

49:28.215 --> 49:30.423
Look, mate, I understand your
problem with kids these days.

49:30.551 --> 49:33.669
I mean, we deal with it
on a daily basis, right?

49:33.804 --> 49:36.217
- Where is he now?
- He's outside.

49:36.348 --> 49:39.512
Just wants to come in, say he's sorry
and try and sort this out.

49:39.643 --> 49:43.011
Go get him in. Relax.

49:43.147 --> 49:45.639
It's in my interest
to sort things out, right?

49:45.774 --> 49:48.061
I mean, I'm the one who's out of pocket.

49:48.194 --> 49:50.060
Ask and it shall be given to you.

49:50.196 --> 49:53.860
Seek and you shall find.
Matthew, verse seven.

49:53.991 --> 49:55.857
Hallelujah.

49:57.828 --> 49:59.319
Move your arse.

50:02.500 --> 50:05.083
Here. Sit down.

50:09.381 --> 50:13.045
Look, son. I've listened to your dad.

50:13.177 --> 50:15.089
And the fact that you've come here

50:15.221 --> 50:18.134
to face up to it, well, that bodes well.

50:18.265 --> 50:21.724
But stealing? Well, that's a crime.

50:21.852 --> 50:23.718
I mean, the law says so,

50:23.854 --> 50:27.768
and fuck me if Jesus Christ
doesn't say so, too.

50:27.900 --> 50:31.109
But stealing from me,

50:32.488 --> 50:34.980
well, that's the worse crime
you could commit.

50:48.504 --> 50:50.370
Now, I could've finished him off,

50:50.506 --> 50:53.340
but Jesus said thou shalt not kill.

50:53.467 --> 50:55.504
Every time you look at your fucking hand

50:55.636 --> 50:59.175
you'll have a little reminder
never to steal again!

51:08.232 --> 51:10.815
- I come bearing gifts, boys.
- Where the fuck did you get it?

51:10.943 --> 51:13.981
Come on, Patrick. What do I do for a living?

51:14.113 --> 51:17.481
Get in here and shut the door.
Make sure we're good.

51:19.076 --> 51:21.318
Fuck me, double prepared.

51:22.997 --> 51:26.411
What a beautiful sight.
That's a fucking line.

51:34.717 --> 51:37.460
No, no, no, Pat. Not my poison.

51:37.595 --> 51:40.178
Now, if that was a Jameson's over ice,

51:40.306 --> 51:41.968
break your arm off for it.

51:42.099 --> 51:44.512
I'll tell you what, that is fucking good.

51:44.643 --> 51:46.760
- That's fucking beautiful.
- Oh.

51:48.897 --> 51:51.105
That's fucking quality. That is quality.

51:51.233 --> 51:53.395
Quality? I'm gonna go
and get some quality food.

51:53.527 --> 51:54.813
I'm hungry.

51:54.945 --> 51:57.938
Mick, that's the last
fucking thing I want to do.

51:58.073 --> 52:00.190
Look, finish it up. I'll walk with you.

52:03.329 --> 52:04.615
Wait, wait, wait.

52:06.290 --> 52:08.452
You know the funny thing is?

52:08.584 --> 52:10.325
I nearly knocked that shit on the head.

52:10.461 --> 52:12.418
I've had a sniff two or three times

52:12.546 --> 52:13.912
in maybe fucking two years.

52:14.048 --> 52:17.917
- Fair play to you.
- Whoa, whoa. Hold on a minute.

52:18.052 --> 52:19.544
What's up?

52:22.014 --> 52:24.176
That is a real creeper.

52:24.658 --> 52:26.649
I'm gonna go back and have a wank.

52:28.854 --> 52:31.437
Tell me, how are you, okay?

52:33.567 --> 52:35.559
- No.
- What's the matter?

52:35.694 --> 52:38.061
It's always tough seeing you in here.

52:38.197 --> 52:41.235
I know it is, but did you bring the money?

52:42.993 --> 52:45.280
- I don't know...
- Kate.

52:45.412 --> 52:47.404
Listen to me.
Did you bring the fucking money?

52:47.539 --> 52:49.155
- Yes or no?
- Yeah, yeah.

52:55.839 --> 52:58.456
Slide it through under the table.

52:58.592 --> 53:01.676
You're gonna follow me
through that door over there.

53:12.189 --> 53:14.226
'Me and Kate had been together for years.

53:14.358 --> 53:16.145
'She knew what I was and what I am,

53:16.276 --> 53:18.108
'and always had the good
sense to look the other way

53:18.237 --> 53:20.229
'whenever I fucked about.

53:20.364 --> 53:23.198
'She never seemed to care,
but she was a party girl.

53:23.325 --> 53:26.944
'I mean, a proper fucking party girl.'

53:27.079 --> 53:29.571
Right, you got ten minutes. Don't hang about.

53:29.707 --> 53:31.323
We won't.

53:34.545 --> 53:36.582
What're you doing?

53:36.714 --> 53:39.707
- What the fuck's it look like?
- I thought you were clean.

53:39.842 --> 53:42.801
Kate, have you got any idea

53:42.928 --> 53:45.636
how long the fucking hours
take to pass in this place?

53:45.764 --> 53:48.177
- I know it must be hard.
- Hard?

53:48.308 --> 53:51.642
How would you fucking know?
You're not doing the time.

53:51.770 --> 53:53.227
See this gear?

53:53.355 --> 53:56.098
This gear seriously burns
into the fucking hours.

53:56.233 --> 53:58.190
It's like a fucking time machine.

53:58.318 --> 54:00.731
And I set the clock to 1994.
I'm gonna be out of here

54:00.863 --> 54:03.196
- before you fucking know it.
- Not a good idea.

54:03.323 --> 54:04.484
You were doing so well.

54:04.616 --> 54:06.107
Yeah, well, now I'm doing
even fucking better,

54:06.243 --> 54:07.984
so have a line and get on the cunting plane.

54:08.120 --> 54:10.737
I can't, Pat. It's not for me no more.

54:10.873 --> 54:13.707
This is fucking good stuff.

54:13.834 --> 54:15.996
'When a stone-cold fucking cokehead

54:16.128 --> 54:17.710
'refuses a fat line of gear,

54:17.838 --> 54:20.251
'you don't need to be
Miss Cunting Fucking Marple

54:20.382 --> 54:22.795
'to realize there's something
fucking seriously wrong.'

54:22.926 --> 54:26.670
You know I tried to get off of this. I tried.

54:31.935 --> 54:33.801
You look good.

54:37.483 --> 54:39.440
Get up.

54:41.653 --> 54:43.110
Get up.

54:59.630 --> 55:02.043
Get out of them knickers.

55:02.174 --> 55:04.666
Keep your legs together
and stick your bum out.

55:04.802 --> 55:08.136
Stick your bum out. That's it. That's it.

55:37.292 --> 55:39.830
Don't look at me like that.

55:39.962 --> 55:42.249
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

55:43.549 --> 55:45.131
You have any idea,

55:45.259 --> 55:48.468
any idea what it's taken me
to fucking organize this?

55:48.595 --> 55:50.803
Have you?

55:50.931 --> 55:54.390
Now I look at you and you've got
that fucking look on your face.

55:54.518 --> 55:58.558
You're ungrateful. You're fucking ungrateful.

56:02.943 --> 56:05.060
'That was the first shag I'd had in years,

56:05.195 --> 56:08.859
'and she was about
as lively as a fucking corpse.

56:08.991 --> 56:10.607
'I'm telling you something now.

56:10.742 --> 56:14.281
'You ask me, this girl has got
her mind on something else.

56:14.413 --> 56:16.120
'Or someone.'

56:39.980 --> 56:41.391
Feel better?

57:11.219 --> 57:13.677
- Taffy!
- Hey...

57:13.805 --> 57:17.719
Tell Pat that's nothing
compared to what he's gonna get.

57:21.605 --> 57:23.392
Alright, alright, I don't want no trouble.

57:23.523 --> 57:25.105
You fucking prick!

57:27.694 --> 57:29.902
What are you lot fucking staring at?

57:37.454 --> 57:41.869
- So who's this fucking Mad Dog?
- Haven't had the pleasure yet.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.832
I had a row with a couple of the geezers

57:43.961 --> 57:45.668
he's got wrapped around him.

57:45.796 --> 57:47.458
I don't why I've been brought into this.

57:47.589 --> 57:51.299
What'd you think? They saw you with me.

57:51.426 --> 57:53.668
- So you're now a target.
- Oh, fucking great.

57:53.804 --> 57:55.796
Look, Jim, no matter how you look at this,

57:55.931 --> 57:59.095
we've now got enemies
on both sides of the fence.

58:00.394 --> 58:04.013
- So what are we gonna do?
- Time will tell.

58:34.720 --> 58:36.632
Please, God, no.

58:45.063 --> 58:48.227
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

58:51.153 --> 58:53.395
- And it's mine?
- What do you mean is it yours?

58:53.530 --> 58:54.691
Of course it is.

58:54.823 --> 58:57.065
Kate, we was only together one fucking time.

58:57.200 --> 58:59.237
That's all it takes.

59:04.207 --> 59:05.118
You look me in the eye

59:05.250 --> 59:08.618
and tell me you ain't been
with fucking no one else.

59:12.340 --> 59:13.876
Promise.

59:21.308 --> 59:23.015
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

59:23.143 --> 59:25.135
It's just this fucking place
is doing me nut in.

59:25.270 --> 59:27.136
You don't have to worry about me, okay?

59:32.319 --> 59:35.312
- Where you going?
- I've organized the room again.

59:36.281 --> 59:39.649
- No. No thanks.
- What?

59:41.787 --> 59:43.028
You serious?

59:43.163 --> 59:44.574
About not being bent over a table

59:44.706 --> 59:47.414
and fucked for ten seconds? Yeah, I am.

59:50.462 --> 59:51.748
I don't understand.

59:51.880 --> 59:54.998
I'm not the same girl I was
when you got put in here.

59:56.051 --> 01:00:01.422
I've changed, I've had to.
And you have to too, Pat.

01:00:01.556 --> 01:00:03.218
I didn't realize it upset you that much,

01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:05.808
going back to that room before.
I thought you liked it.

01:00:05.936 --> 01:00:09.270
Well, clearly you've lost
your manners in here, Pat.

01:00:09.397 --> 01:00:13.061
We're having a baby
and you're gonna be a father.

01:00:13.193 --> 01:00:15.185
So act like one.

01:00:16.655 --> 01:00:18.442
I will.

01:00:33.964 --> 01:00:36.047
- Present for you.
- What is it?

01:00:36.174 --> 01:00:39.508
Steroids, the best.

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:41.593
Just what I needed, much appreciated.

01:00:41.721 --> 01:00:46.887
- That fucking gear you gave us.
- I told you, didn't I?

01:00:47.018 --> 01:00:49.761
That shit fucking hit
the nostalgia buttons, mate.

01:00:49.896 --> 01:00:53.435
I ain't had gear like that
for five fucking years.

01:00:53.567 --> 01:00:55.524
There is one thing I need from you.

01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:57.314
- Always is.
- And it's a deal breaker.

01:00:57.445 --> 01:01:00.529
That Joss and that Luke,

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:02.649
that little firm has gotta go, mate.

01:01:02.784 --> 01:01:04.150
You don't wanna sort it out?

01:01:04.286 --> 01:01:06.323
Not in a million fucking years.

01:01:06.454 --> 01:01:08.446
Me and you wanna put Southend and Basildon

01:01:08.582 --> 01:01:10.414
on the map, in the big time.

01:01:10.542 --> 01:01:13.000
Them pair of cunts don't
figure in the bigger picture.

01:01:13.128 --> 01:01:15.836
So why should I risk all this for you?

01:01:15.964 --> 01:01:18.581
Cos I'm gonna make you famous.

01:01:18.717 --> 01:01:21.425
That Mad Dog and his band
of cunts ain't fucking silly.

01:01:21.553 --> 01:01:22.919
They're doing exactly what I'm doing.

01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:24.920
They're playing a fucking waiting game.

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:27.927
Listen, I'm out of here, Pat.

01:01:28.059 --> 01:01:31.348
Day after next, I'm breathing
free fucking air again,

01:01:31.479 --> 01:01:35.189
so if we're gonna hit them,
we need to do it now, tonight.

01:01:35.317 --> 01:01:36.649
We got to fight this on two fronts.

01:01:36.776 --> 01:01:38.358
I need you on the outside.

01:01:38.486 --> 01:01:40.443
You're gonna get a chance
of getting them cunts back

01:01:40.572 --> 01:01:42.609
who put you in here.

01:01:42.741 --> 01:01:44.482
Believe me when I say Joss' little firm

01:01:44.618 --> 01:01:46.905
has had its fucking day.

01:01:48.163 --> 01:01:49.574
All his mates are out now, gaffer.

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:52.119
Don't be too fucking sure about that.

01:01:57.130 --> 01:01:59.497
Gotta do him. Make him pay.

01:02:07.641 --> 01:02:11.100
So, you finally decided to show yourself.

01:02:11.228 --> 01:02:13.015
I mean with a name like fucking Mad Dog,

01:02:13.146 --> 01:02:16.605
you been pretty mellow up until now.

01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:20.568
I been in fucking solitary
thanks to your new mate, Lewis.

01:02:20.695 --> 01:02:23.529
- Where we going with this?
- Meaning?

01:02:23.657 --> 01:02:26.070
I mean we really got to go
through this whole bollocks?

01:02:26.201 --> 01:02:28.864
He was bang out of order what
he did to Cokey and Steamboat.

01:02:28.995 --> 01:02:30.236
It's gotta be paid for.

01:02:30.372 --> 01:02:33.115
Listen to me, Jimmy's paid
a fucking heavy price.

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:36.163
He's lucky that silly cunt didn't kill him.

01:02:36.294 --> 01:02:38.286
Got your attention, didn't I?

01:02:38.421 --> 01:02:41.797
Look I'm here, I'm standing in front
of you, I'm putting me hand out.

01:02:41.925 --> 01:02:44.713
Let's just fucking move on,
let bygones be bygones.

01:02:46.638 --> 01:02:49.381
- I'll think about it.
- What's that mean?

01:02:49.516 --> 01:02:51.473
It means I'll fucking think about it.

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:53.934
- I need an answer.
- No, you want an answer.

01:02:54.062 --> 01:02:56.349
So, you'll have to sweat
a little bit longer, Pat, eh?

01:02:56.481 --> 01:02:59.770
But you'll find out soon
enough, one way or another.

01:03:19.337 --> 01:03:22.080
- Is that him?
- Yeah, that's the cunt.

01:03:36.938 --> 01:03:39.396
Come on, let's fucking get him!

01:03:41.192 --> 01:03:43.354
Don't make me run, you cunt!

01:04:15.226 --> 01:04:17.388
Where you going, you fucking mug?

01:04:23.068 --> 01:04:25.276
No, Tony. Put the fucking television down!

01:04:28.073 --> 01:04:31.737
- My fucking television!
- Shut up and sit down!

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:34.451
Get this piece of shit out of here now.

01:04:34.579 --> 01:04:37.947
- You fucking cunt!
- No, please.

01:04:38.083 --> 01:04:39.369
- Get up.
- What?

01:04:39.501 --> 01:04:41.163
I said stand up.

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:44.537
Listen, I'm sorry about that, alright?

01:04:47.384 --> 01:04:48.591
Take that.

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:50.960
And keep your fucking mouth shut,
you understand?

01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:08.185
Give us one of them Wilbur Smith jobs.

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:26.162
Now you're fucking Dead dog.

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:04.241
Told you to fucking let it go, didn't I? Eh?

01:06:04.377 --> 01:06:07.211
But you won't fucking listen.

01:06:16.139 --> 01:06:18.631
Here's Tony!

01:06:18.766 --> 01:06:20.507
Fucking come here.

01:06:22.228 --> 01:06:24.220
Fucking stay there, you!

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:43.038
I left you till last.

01:07:06.981 --> 01:07:09.394
Come on, Kate, you can do it.

01:07:13.321 --> 01:07:15.608
One more push, one more push.

01:07:23.957 --> 01:07:26.074
It's a little girl.

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:40.797
I don't know what the fuck
you think you're doing, Tony,

01:07:40.932 --> 01:07:43.094
but you ain't gonna fucking get away with it.

01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:48.722
I know people, yeah.
You don't have a fucking clue.

01:07:48.856 --> 01:07:53.146
Yeah, I do, you fucking grass.
You're coppers' best friend.

01:07:53.278 --> 01:07:57.488
"I'll grass everyone up
as long as you leave me alone."

01:07:57.615 --> 01:07:59.322
Let me tell you something, you cunts.

01:07:59.450 --> 01:08:02.614
You won't be telling anybody fuck all!

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:06.364
You got the wrong idea.
We can sort it out, alright?

01:08:06.499 --> 01:08:08.707
I mean, you know I've got connections.

01:08:08.835 --> 01:08:10.451
We could do stuff.

01:08:10.587 --> 01:08:13.295
You could work on the clubs
and then we could...

01:08:13.423 --> 01:08:18.009
We could, I could... You could run the doors.

01:08:18.136 --> 01:08:20.127
I mean, we could be a team.

01:08:20.263 --> 01:08:22.345
This sounds fucking great, boys, doesn't it?

01:08:22.473 --> 01:08:25.466
But you know something?
I'd rather take up roadsweeping

01:08:25.602 --> 01:08:27.594
than work with you, you fucking cunt.

01:08:27.729 --> 01:08:30.062
We know what you said, you fucking grass.

01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:34.058
And you know something?
We got some important friends.

01:08:34.193 --> 01:08:35.809
And they don't fucking like you.

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:37.560
They said it's only a matter of time

01:08:37.697 --> 01:08:41.532
before you drop us all in
the fucking shit and move on.

01:08:41.658 --> 01:08:43.321
- Trust me, Tony.
- Trust you?

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:45.740
I wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire.

01:08:45.872 --> 01:08:49.456
- No, you got it all wrong.
- Here, Tone.

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:59.459
My boys are gonna fucking rip you apart.

01:09:01.011 --> 01:09:04.255
Who? Terry and Andy?

01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:06.096
No, mate, that's where you're wrong.

01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:07.841
They've switched sides to the winners.

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:10.435
Thing is, Joss, you think
you're top dog around these parts,

01:09:10.563 --> 01:09:13.555
Pat Tate banged up, Old Bill in your pocket.

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:21.443
Anyone that comes up against you,
you just grass up anyway.

01:09:21.573 --> 01:09:23.907
You little fucking rat cunt.

01:09:24.035 --> 01:09:26.618
I heard that you even quote
the Bible, talking about Jesus

01:09:26.746 --> 01:09:29.488
as you're fucking up some kid,
ruining his life.

01:09:29.624 --> 01:09:32.162
Maybe you think you are Jesus.

01:09:33.461 --> 01:09:36.249
We all know what happened to him, don't we?

01:09:55.441 --> 01:09:58.309
Very reminiscent of a Caravaggio.

01:10:14.001 --> 01:10:17.540
So...

01:10:17.672 --> 01:10:20.164
I've got three statements naming you.

01:10:20.299 --> 01:10:22.837
- No, you don't.
- They named you.

01:10:22.969 --> 01:10:25.052
All three of them.

01:10:25.179 --> 01:10:27.592
You don't know how it works, do you?

01:10:27.724 --> 01:10:30.467
I mean, not from that side of the desk.

01:10:30.601 --> 01:10:32.638
Well, perhaps in your worldly wisdom,

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:35.137
you can enlighten me.

01:10:35.273 --> 01:10:37.640
The only way to survive in here,

01:10:37.775 --> 01:10:40.267
and I mean the only way to survive,

01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:44.443
is to never, ever grass.

01:10:44.574 --> 01:10:47.487
But somehow you expect me
to believe that not one,

01:10:47.618 --> 01:10:50.406
but three inmates broke that sacred law.

01:10:55.501 --> 01:10:59.165
- Get the fuck out of my office!
- Yes, sir.

01:11:09.515 --> 01:11:11.256
What's up, Sam? Why the secret meet?

01:11:11.392 --> 01:11:13.975
You look lovely. Take a seat.

01:11:17.607 --> 01:11:19.894
Well, thanks for coming.

01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:23.610
We need to talk.

01:11:23.738 --> 01:11:28.108
Before Pat went away,
he asked me to look after you,

01:11:28.242 --> 01:11:31.656
make sure you was alright,
keep an eye on you.

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:35.622
Well, I have.

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:40.293
I understand, Kate, I really do.

01:11:40.421 --> 01:11:43.380
You're an attractive young woman
and you have your needs,

01:11:43.508 --> 01:11:45.841
but think of the consequences.

01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:48.802
If not for yourself,

01:11:48.930 --> 01:11:50.887
then for your lover.

01:11:51.015 --> 01:11:54.634
If Pat finds out,
and he will, they always do,

01:11:54.769 --> 01:11:56.852
he will kill him.

01:11:58.773 --> 01:12:00.435
Bye, Sam.

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:05.102
Finish it, Kate.

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:10.907
Look, Kate, you don't understand.

01:12:11.035 --> 01:12:12.742
They're fucking me about all day.

01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:14.486
They're talking about fucking six o'clock.

01:12:14.622 --> 01:12:17.285
If it's six o'clock, then, you know...

01:12:18.793 --> 01:12:21.627
Listen to me. I ain't got the hump.

01:12:23.464 --> 01:12:25.421
Just fucking slow down a second,

01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:27.462
listen to what I'm trying to say to you.

01:12:27.593 --> 01:12:30.711
I don't know. As soon as I know, you'll know.

01:12:31.889 --> 01:12:34.506
Of course I'm excited to see you. Yeah.

01:12:37.103 --> 01:12:40.062
I love you, too. I'll see you tomorrow.

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:42.647
Okay, I'll see you then.

01:12:46.445 --> 01:12:49.028
'Prison definitely changes a man.

01:12:49.156 --> 01:12:50.818
'All those years inside and you realize

01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:53.237
'what's important in life.

01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:56.237
'My new baby, cos I swear to God,

01:12:56.372 --> 01:12:58.238
'no more fucking distractions.'

01:12:58.374 --> 01:13:01.617
- Oh, fucking hell.
- Come on, get in the car.

01:13:01.752 --> 01:13:04.540
Listen. Don't take this
the fucking wrong way, but...

01:13:04.672 --> 01:13:06.834
it's lovely to see you but
I've got someone picking me up.

01:13:06.966 --> 01:13:08.798
- Cocaine.
- Brasses.

01:13:08.926 --> 01:13:11.088
Get in the car. In the car!

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:13.883
You cunts, it's fucking raining.
Come on, then go.

01:13:14.015 --> 01:13:17.383
Oh, here we go! Fuck it!

01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:33.198
You're gonna see Daddy today, baby girl.

01:13:33.326 --> 01:13:36.819
# Free to feel good

01:13:36.954 --> 01:13:39.788
# Everybody's free #

01:13:39.916 --> 01:13:41.657
Fuckin' love you.

01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:50.087
- Can I help you, love?
- I'm here to pick up Pat Tate.

01:13:50.217 --> 01:13:53.301
He left. He signed out, sorry.

01:13:54.972 --> 01:13:58.056
Let me say something to you,
and I mean this, seriously.

01:13:58.184 --> 01:14:00.301
- I love you two.
- I love you, too.

01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:02.348
You're my best friend.

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:05.314
And we are gonna fucking
take over this fucking town.

01:14:06.317 --> 01:14:10.152
# Everybody's free

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:13.317
# To feel good

01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:17.193
# Everybody's free

01:14:17.328 --> 01:14:19.661
# To feel good... #

01:14:41.394 --> 01:14:43.477
Oh, come on, I love you.

01:14:57.159 --> 01:14:58.741
Tone, listen to me. Oi!

01:14:58.869 --> 01:15:02.033
What the fuck? Whoo-hoo-hoo.

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:04.872
Gonna slip off with that bird.
Pick me up in the morning.

01:15:06.627 --> 01:15:08.869
Oh, look at you, you dirty fucker.

01:15:38.117 --> 01:15:41.451
Good luck, mate. You'll fucking need it.

01:15:44.081 --> 01:15:45.492
Call me later.

01:15:48.586 --> 01:15:49.576
Go on, mate.

01:16:01.265 --> 01:16:03.222
- Fuck off, Pat.
- Kate, Kate!

01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:05.137
Just let me fucking explain.

01:16:05.269 --> 01:16:08.228
Don't fucking walk away from me.
Just fucking talk to me.

01:16:08.355 --> 01:16:11.314
What do you want, Pat? It's over.

01:16:11.442 --> 01:16:14.268
You couldn't even wait for me
and your daughter at the prison gates.

01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:15.894
So you can fuck off with your mates,

01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:19.899
getting high, drinking,
whatever fucking else.

01:16:20.034 --> 01:16:22.777
You've had years in prison, Pat.

01:16:22.912 --> 01:16:25.120
You're no different now to when you went in.

01:16:25.247 --> 01:16:28.490
I, like a fucking idiot,
thought you might fucking change.

01:16:31.087 --> 01:16:34.626
You're fucking seeing someone, aren't you?

01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:38.296
I can tell by your fucking face,
the way you're acting.

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:41.010
Concerned, are we?

01:16:41.138 --> 01:16:43.300
As it happens, I was seeing someone.

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:45.094
For a short time, didn't amount to much,

01:16:45.226 --> 01:16:46.888
because like a silly cow, I ended it.

01:16:47.019 --> 01:16:50.599
Because I had a husband in prison who
I wanted to wait for and I thought I loved.

01:16:53.567 --> 01:16:56.935
What's his fucking name?
Who is he? You fucking tell me.

01:16:57.071 --> 01:16:58.858
Why? So you can find him
and beat him to a pulp?

01:16:58.989 --> 01:17:00.946
Make you feel better?

01:17:01.075 --> 01:17:03.863
Just go. It's over.

01:17:03.994 --> 01:17:06.077
I'm sorry, alright?

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:11.290
You're right in what you're saying.

01:17:11.418 --> 01:17:13.785
You're right and I'm wrong.

01:17:13.921 --> 01:17:16.504
I brought all this on myself, I know it.

01:17:16.632 --> 01:17:19.466
But listen to me, I'm begging you.

01:17:19.593 --> 01:17:21.755
Kate, I need your help.

01:17:21.887 --> 01:17:25.096
I've got nowhere to go, nowhere.

01:17:25.224 --> 01:17:28.513
Please just let me stay
for a few days. I, uh...

01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:30.180
I'll sleep on the armchair. I'm begging you.

01:17:30.312 --> 01:17:34.272
Listen, I won't come near you,
I won't touch you, I promise.

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:36.517
And I know that I don't deserve this.

01:17:39.989 --> 01:17:42.732
Please, can I hold
our daughter for one second?

01:17:53.335 --> 01:17:55.122
Here's your dad.

01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:01.166
She's beautiful.

01:18:05.556 --> 01:18:08.219
That's your beautiful Mum over there.
See her?

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:10.057
See, see?

01:18:13.731 --> 01:18:15.688
I'll make some tea.

01:18:19.153 --> 01:18:20.519
Hello, Pat. It's Tony. Yeah.

01:18:20.654 --> 01:18:23.818
I'm just gonna put you
on loudspeaker, mate. Hang on.

01:18:23.949 --> 01:18:26.236
- Where are you?
- What do you mean, where am I?

01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:28.075
I'm at home. Where do you think I am?

01:18:28.204 --> 01:18:30.571
- Where's Kate?
- She's out with the kid.

01:18:30.706 --> 01:18:33.244
What, you think I strangled
and buried her in the garden?

01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:34.957
You and her are sweet, yeah?

01:18:35.085 --> 01:18:37.793
I thought she'd have fucking
killed you, mate, to be honest.

01:18:37.922 --> 01:18:40.960
Well, my feet are under the table,
put it that way.

01:18:41.091 --> 01:18:43.128
But listen, mate.

01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:46.924
She was seeing someone while I was away

01:18:47.056 --> 01:18:49.764
and I need to fucking find out who.

01:18:49.892 --> 01:18:51.303
Yeah, erm...

01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:57.389
I know, we knew,
but we're gonna put a stop to it.

01:18:57.524 --> 01:18:59.356
What d'you say?

01:18:59.485 --> 01:19:01.397
You're telling me you cunts
fucking knew about it

01:19:01.528 --> 01:19:03.520
and no one told me?

01:19:03.656 --> 01:19:06.069
You were inside, mate.
I mean, what was the point?

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:07.486
Anyway, it didn't go anywhere,

01:19:07.618 --> 01:19:09.951
so why not let sleeping dogs lie, eh?

01:19:10.746 --> 01:19:12.453
How did you find out?

01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:15.164
She told me when she was throwing me out.

01:19:15.292 --> 01:19:19.286
- Brave girl.
- Listen to me carefully.

01:19:19.421 --> 01:19:21.378
You find that cunt.

01:19:21.507 --> 01:19:24.295
And when you do, you let me know.

01:19:34.186 --> 01:19:35.347
Cunt!

01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:51.159
- Pat, we got hold of him.
- What's he fucking look like?

01:19:51.287 --> 01:19:54.576
Don't know, mate. Pretty fucking ordinary.

01:19:54.707 --> 01:19:57.916
Looks like fucking nonce to me.
What do you want done with him?

01:19:58.043 --> 01:20:00.376
I'll tell you what I fucking
want done with him.

01:20:00.504 --> 01:20:03.542
Cut his cock and bollocks off
and put them in his mouth.

01:20:03.674 --> 01:20:06.166
So he don't fuck no one else's bird.

01:20:06.302 --> 01:20:07.759
Done.

01:20:38.917 --> 01:20:41.000
What's your name?

01:20:42.921 --> 01:20:45.834
- Adrian.
- Adrian.

01:20:47.301 --> 01:20:51.466
- And where you from, Adrian?
- London.

01:20:52.181 --> 01:20:56.175
London? Ooh.

01:20:56.310 --> 01:21:01.522
Now I want you to listen to me
very carefully, Adrian.

01:21:01.648 --> 01:21:04.686
We've all pulled birds before.

01:21:04.818 --> 01:21:06.605
But you...

01:21:11.867 --> 01:21:14.826
You've been very unlucky.

01:21:14.953 --> 01:21:20.119
You see, Kate's husband,
our friend, is a psychopath.

01:21:22.127 --> 01:21:23.959
I've seen him cut off a man's face

01:21:24.088 --> 01:21:27.581
just for looking at her the wrong way.

01:21:28.592 --> 01:21:30.174
In fact,

01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:33.257
do you mind if I borrow that a moment, Tone?

01:21:33.389 --> 01:21:36.473
Not at all, Sam. Be my guest.

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:38.637
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.

01:21:40.187 --> 01:21:42.304
He wants us...

01:21:43.857 --> 01:21:46.065
...to relieve you of your testicles

01:21:46.193 --> 01:21:50.608
and send them back to him in a little box.

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:54.198
Now, what do you think I should do, Adrian?

01:21:55.661 --> 01:21:57.277
Please.

01:21:58.539 --> 01:22:01.247
Please, I beg you. Please.

01:22:03.836 --> 01:22:08.297
You know what?
I think today's your lucky day.

01:22:10.467 --> 01:22:13.676
Now I suggest you go back to London

01:22:13.804 --> 01:22:18.048
and never come within 30 miles
of Southend ever again.

01:22:18.809 --> 01:22:21.347
Do I make myself clear?

01:22:28.944 --> 01:22:31.402
So you sorted out that cunt, then, yeah?

01:22:31.530 --> 01:22:34.113
Yeah, I sorted that cunt.
You'll never hear from him again.

01:22:34.241 --> 01:22:37.700
That's all you need to know. Now forget it.

01:22:38.829 --> 01:22:40.240
Listen, thanks, I appreciate it,

01:22:40.372 --> 01:22:42.739
but it fucking kills me. Kills me.

01:22:42.875 --> 01:22:46.243
The fucking thought that she'd
even fucking fuck about on me.

01:22:46.378 --> 01:22:48.290
We don't know that she has, mate.

01:22:48.422 --> 01:22:50.334
You've been away for five fucking years.

01:22:50.466 --> 01:22:52.708
What d'you expect, Mother fucking Teresa?

01:22:52.843 --> 01:22:54.835
She's a good girl, that Kate.

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:56.461
If it was me, what would you fucking say?

01:22:56.597 --> 01:22:59.089
I'd say get over it. You little fat poof.

01:22:59.224 --> 01:23:03.434
- You fucking cunt.
- I'd say get over it!

01:23:03.562 --> 01:23:05.178
You fat poof!

01:23:06.565 --> 01:23:09.103
Boys, the garage, sugar, now.

01:23:21.872 --> 01:23:24.205
I'll just talk to him. Excuse me?

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:25.665
Can you move, please?

01:23:25.792 --> 01:23:29.957
- Traffic is terrible...
- I'm late. I need petrol.

01:23:30.088 --> 01:23:32.751
Excuse me. What do think
you're doing, parking like this?

01:23:32.883 --> 01:23:34.875
What you talking about?
I ain't even fucking driving.

01:23:35.010 --> 01:23:37.468
Fucking selfish. Other people
need petrol, too, you know.

01:23:37.596 --> 01:23:39.758
Who are you? Do you fucking live around here?

01:23:42.976 --> 01:23:44.683
Dad, oh, my God!

01:23:46.063 --> 01:23:48.100
Cunt thinks he's a fucking traffic warden!

01:23:48.232 --> 01:23:50.519
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:23:50.651 --> 01:23:54.190
You animal! I'll have you locked up!

01:23:55.921 --> 01:23:57.655
Pat, you animal.

01:23:59.910 --> 01:24:02.147
Fucking silly old cunt, anyway.

01:24:19.471 --> 01:24:22.430
'Me and Tony took over
Joss and Luke's old club.

01:24:22.558 --> 01:24:25.096
'And the world was at our feet.

01:24:25.227 --> 01:24:28.391
'We had the doors, we had the drugs,
we had the muscle.

01:24:28.522 --> 01:24:30.764
'And it was all going perfectly.'

01:24:52.963 --> 01:24:54.955
I caught him pushing pills.

01:25:00.846 --> 01:25:02.803
You know the fucking rules.

01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:06.428
Empty your pockets, all the drugs
and the cash, then you can go.

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:08.472
But you ain't getting back
in here again, understand?

01:25:08.604 --> 01:25:10.220
Now fuck off, you little mug!

01:25:10.355 --> 01:25:13.189
Fuck off, yeah! Fuck off! Fuck off!

01:25:13.317 --> 01:25:15.684
Come on, you fucking cunt. Come on!

01:25:18.447 --> 01:25:19.904
'Then that soppy cunt Kenny

01:25:20.032 --> 01:25:21.819
'had to go and rock the fucking boat.'

01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:25.239
Fucking hell, Ken. He's fucking out of it.

01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:27.362
We need to call an ambulance.

01:25:30.876 --> 01:25:32.993
Get rid of that, quick.

01:25:34.254 --> 01:25:35.961
We was inside, heard a scuffle,

01:25:36.089 --> 01:25:37.751
come out and this is what we found, alright?

01:25:37.883 --> 01:25:40.375
But when he wakes up
he's gonna say something different.

01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:43.469
He ain't saying fuck all. He's dead.

01:25:44.598 --> 01:25:46.260
Fuck him.

01:25:52.314 --> 01:25:55.603
'Dead bodies made a lot of noise.

01:25:55.734 --> 01:25:59.318
'The last thing we needed was
the Old Bill sniffing about.'

01:26:06.703 --> 01:26:08.740
The Old Bill are swarming
all over the fucking club.

01:26:08.872 --> 01:26:10.704
They're interviewing
the customers, the staff.

01:26:10.832 --> 01:26:13.950
- It's a fucking nightmare.
- How does that affect us?

01:26:14.086 --> 01:26:16.294
It's their club and we run the fucking door.

01:26:16.421 --> 01:26:18.834
The real problem for us
is that fucking spade who died

01:26:18.965 --> 01:26:21.753
is wrapped round
some fucking firm from Brixton.

01:26:21.885 --> 01:26:23.717
This is bad.

01:26:23.845 --> 01:26:25.336
Got the fucking Yardies onto us now.

01:26:25.472 --> 01:26:27.179
Fuck them.

01:26:27.307 --> 01:26:29.390
We go down there first
and we nip it in the bud.

01:26:29.518 --> 01:26:31.134
We get new doormen
and we go down there firm handed

01:26:31.269 --> 01:26:33.556
and we fucking smash them. That's what we do.

01:26:33.689 --> 01:26:36.227
You'll never learn, will you?

01:26:38.276 --> 01:26:41.986
You lot wanna slow down.
Think of the business.

01:26:42.114 --> 01:26:45.027
That's exactly what I'm fucking doing.

01:26:45.158 --> 01:26:48.196
'You don't get points
for backing down in this game.

01:26:48.328 --> 01:26:50.536
'Sam just didn't have the vision.

01:26:50.664 --> 01:26:53.247
'The reason I'm gonna last
forever in this business

01:26:53.375 --> 01:26:56.834
'is because I'll take on
the fucking world if I have to.'

01:27:30.912 --> 01:27:32.949
So, Mickey...

01:27:33.081 --> 01:27:36.415
More problems round your way, I hear.

01:27:36.543 --> 01:27:39.456
Another dead body.

01:27:39.588 --> 01:27:42.752
Pat Tate and his mates need reeling in a bit.

01:27:48.138 --> 01:27:52.758
Get it stopped, Mickey,
or I may have to step in.

01:27:58.106 --> 01:28:00.018
If those Yardies are doing drive-bys,

01:28:00.150 --> 01:28:01.812
I say we stay well clear of them.

01:28:01.943 --> 01:28:05.562
That's a shame, because I got
myself tooled up with a gun.

01:28:05.697 --> 01:28:07.313
A what?

01:28:07.449 --> 01:28:10.658
A fucking gun? Craig, you know the drill.

01:28:10.786 --> 01:28:12.527
We don't take a gun anywhere, mate.

01:28:12.662 --> 01:28:15.245
You take a gun somewhere,
you're gonna end up using it.

01:28:15.373 --> 01:28:17.035
I ain't got any bullets.

01:28:17.167 --> 01:28:19.580
We can still get a tug
from the Old Bill, Craig.

01:28:19.711 --> 01:28:21.452
But I've had the firing pins taken out.

01:28:21.588 --> 01:28:23.830
Hold on a minute,
let's get this fucking straight.

01:28:23.965 --> 01:28:27.379
You've got a gun
that's got no fucking bullets.

01:28:27.511 --> 01:28:30.254
But if you was to get hold
of some bullets for the gun,

01:28:30.388 --> 01:28:31.879
the gun still ain't gonna fucking work

01:28:32.015 --> 01:28:33.347
because you got no firing pin.

01:28:33.475 --> 01:28:35.683
There's something fucking
wrong with you, you silly cunt.

01:28:35.811 --> 01:28:37.427
You're not well.

01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:51.949
- You alright, Mick?
- Alright, lads.

01:28:52.077 --> 01:28:54.364
What's so important you couldn't
talk on the fucking phone?

01:28:54.496 --> 01:28:56.328
I've been in some meetings in London

01:28:56.456 --> 01:28:57.947
with some very serious people.

01:28:58.083 --> 01:29:00.416
They asked me to bring back a message to you.

01:29:00.544 --> 01:29:03.412
Things are getting
a little out of order down here

01:29:03.547 --> 01:29:05.584
and you need to tone it down.

01:29:05.715 --> 01:29:08.708
Don't know what you mean.
We run nightclubs not Sunday schools.

01:29:08.844 --> 01:29:10.756
You're gonna get aggravation
from time to time.

01:29:10.887 --> 01:29:13.220
I understand that, Tony,
but what you don't understand is

01:29:13.348 --> 01:29:15.089
the Old Bill are getting
involved in a big way.

01:29:15.225 --> 01:29:17.717
They've got a fucking
great big fat fuck-off file

01:29:17.853 --> 01:29:19.060
with your names on it.

01:29:19.187 --> 01:29:20.723
- You're in the frame...
- Fuck the Old Bill.

01:29:20.856 --> 01:29:22.597
We're not interested.

01:29:22.732 --> 01:29:24.598
Look, Mick, I know they have
to play it by the book,

01:29:24.734 --> 01:29:26.316
but we're fucking protected round here.

01:29:26.444 --> 01:29:29.107
This is our area. No one's grassing on us.

01:29:29.239 --> 01:29:31.982
- Yeah, no one grasses on us.
- Shut up, Craig.

01:29:32.117 --> 01:29:35.827
Alright, well...
I've done my job. I warned you.

01:29:35.954 --> 01:29:37.661
I heard you.

01:29:43.128 --> 01:29:44.915
Yeah, right, okay.

01:30:04.691 --> 01:30:08.025
Look, whatever way you cut it,

01:30:08.153 --> 01:30:11.646
everyone's got the needle
with us and they're concerned.

01:30:11.781 --> 01:30:13.397
But we're making money.

01:30:13.533 --> 01:30:15.991
We're getting hold of bundles of dough.

01:30:16.119 --> 01:30:18.702
So, I say, fuck them cunts in London,

01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:21.163
and we crack on as per usual.

01:30:26.796 --> 01:30:29.163
'Mickey Steele was fucking right.

01:30:29.299 --> 01:30:32.417
'The Old Bill were fucking
crawling all over us.

01:30:32.552 --> 01:30:35.010
'And with those cunts Joss
and Luke out of the picture,

01:30:35.138 --> 01:30:37.630
'Southend was becoming
like the fucking Wild West.

01:30:37.766 --> 01:30:40.258
'Every cunt was fucking robbing each other.

01:30:42.604 --> 01:30:46.268
'We had to put a stop to it,
and show these cunts

01:30:46.399 --> 01:30:49.563
'who was the governor running
the fucking show around here.

01:30:49.694 --> 01:30:52.983
'Even fucking Jimmy G.
turned us over, the dirty cunt.

01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:59.402
'Nothing's gonna fucking stop me.

01:30:59.537 --> 01:31:01.335
'It's like I said...

01:31:02.582 --> 01:31:05.791
'I'll take on the fucking world if I have to.

01:31:09.881 --> 01:31:13.420
# Bleeding heart of mine

01:31:13.551 --> 01:31:18.512
# Flows like claret on a tray

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:22.725
# Different times and different people #

01:31:22.852 --> 01:31:24.593
Alright, Kenny?

01:31:27.565 --> 01:31:30.603
George, get Kenny a drink.

01:31:36.574 --> 01:31:41.615
- You alright mate?
- No, it's not alright.

01:31:41.746 --> 01:31:44.159
It's gone fucking mad out there, mate.

01:31:44.290 --> 01:31:48.159
- It's getting scary.
- Tell me about it.

01:31:48.294 --> 01:31:51.708
I just been chased by two geezers with guns.

01:31:54.134 --> 01:31:58.344
Listen to me, Kenny.
It's all gonna end in tears.

01:31:58.471 --> 01:32:00.508
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:02.427
What you think I should do?

01:32:05.186 --> 01:32:08.896
I got a pal in Glasgow, owes me a favour.

01:32:09.024 --> 01:32:11.107
He'll look after you.

01:32:12.277 --> 01:32:14.519
Get you some work on the doors, eh?

01:32:17.115 --> 01:32:19.983
But you keep your nose clean, yeah?

01:32:20.118 --> 01:32:21.575
Yeah.

01:32:22.537 --> 01:32:24.574
He'll protect you.

01:32:26.041 --> 01:32:29.409
I'll make the arrangements.

01:32:29.544 --> 01:32:32.753
Thanks, Sam. Really appreciate it, mate.

01:32:35.425 --> 01:32:37.166
There she is.

01:32:38.219 --> 01:32:41.053
Southend. You know something?

01:32:41.181 --> 01:32:45.346
We must never, ever forget
this is where it all started.

01:32:45.477 --> 01:32:48.311
Let's have a little reckon-up
here. It's gotta be...

01:32:48.438 --> 01:32:50.725
To my knowledge, it's gotta
be eight to ten clubs

01:32:50.857 --> 01:32:53.099
we now got the fucking doors to.

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:55.521
Yeah, we got the whole fucking area sewn up.

01:32:55.653 --> 01:32:57.064
Fucking dough's rolling in.

01:32:57.197 --> 01:32:59.860
Long as we keep getting
the gear, we're fucking sorted.

01:32:59.991 --> 01:33:02.028
Don't worry about that,
cos Mickey Steele's got

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:04.868
a fucking big consignment
coming in from Amsterdam.

01:33:04.996 --> 01:33:08.080
Boys, we need to get into
the rave scene. It's gonna be big.

01:33:08.208 --> 01:33:10.074
You're right, Rolfie, it's gonna be massive,

01:33:10.210 --> 01:33:12.202
I'm already making plans.

01:33:12.337 --> 01:33:15.546
Listen. I've always said this.

01:33:15.673 --> 01:33:18.131
We are gonna earn fucking millions.

01:33:18.259 --> 01:33:20.467
And you know why we're gonna
earn fucking millions?

01:33:20.595 --> 01:33:22.461
- Why?
- Cos we're the fucking bollocks.

01:33:22.597 --> 01:33:24.554
And no cunt can touch us!

01:33:29.312 --> 01:33:33.352
# Motivating rhythm of life
with a healing rhythmic synergy

01:33:33.483 --> 01:33:35.566
# Motivating rhythm of life

01:33:37.570 --> 01:33:40.779
# Motivating rhythm of life
with a healing rhythmic synergy

01:34:06.683 --> 01:34:09.426
It may be that the shooting has occurred

01:34:09.561 --> 01:34:12.929
over higher drugs dealers

01:34:13.064 --> 01:34:15.852
trying to find a greater position of power.

01:34:41.467 --> 01:34:46.258
# Heaven knows what life may bring

01:34:46.389 --> 01:34:51.350
# There could be blue skies through the rain

01:34:51.477 --> 01:34:55.847
# And I know I must find my way

01:34:55.982 --> 01:35:00.977
# So come on, help me
to release my soul today

01:35:01.112 --> 01:35:03.149
# Won't you help me

01:35:03.281 --> 01:35:06.865
# Help me through this pain

01:35:06.993 --> 01:35:11.863
# Cuts like a knife, burns like acid rain

01:35:11.998 --> 01:35:13.489
# Come on, help me

01:35:13.625 --> 01:35:16.959
# Help me to release my soul

01:35:17.086 --> 01:35:21.706
# Nobody knows which way, which road to go #
