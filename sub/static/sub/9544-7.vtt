01:53.500 --> 01:56.323
Oh, gosh.

01:56.358 --> 01:58.776
Hello?

01:59.418 --> 02:01.234
Hello?

02:01.713 --> 02:03.841
Mr. Donovan?

02:09.402 --> 02:11.678
Mr. Donovan?

02:19.354 --> 02:20.577
What, what are you doing here?

02:20.612 --> 02:22.324
You shouldn't be here.

02:24.276 --> 02:26.667
What are you, what
are you doing?!

02:26.702 --> 02:28.451
Oh! No!

02:28.486 --> 02:32.672
Oh! Oh! Help! Help!

02:32.707 --> 02:34.253
Oh! Help!

02:34.288 --> 02:35.975
Help!

02:37.382 --> 02:41.374
Help!
Help!

02:41.409 --> 02:43.655
Help!

02:44.178 --> 02:46.057
What are you doing?

02:46.757 --> 02:49.100
Help! Somebody help me!

02:49.135 --> 02:52.059
Help me! Help me!
Somebody help me!

02:52.094 --> 02:54.264
Help me!

MONK Season 3 Epi. 07
Monk and the Employee of the Month

04:02.288 --> 04:04.395
Over there, over there.

04:06.103 --> 04:08.063
Maybe I should just
buy a TV while I'm here.

04:08.098 --> 04:09.726
What's the matter with the one
you have? / It broke.

04:09.761 --> 04:11.399
All we get is the science channel.

04:11.434 --> 04:13.377
I swear, if I see one more
show about the moon landing,

04:13.432 --> 04:14.648
I'm going to scream.

04:14.683 --> 04:17.928
Yeah, what could be more dull
than the conquest of space?

04:17.963 --> 04:20.321
Exactly.

04:20.356 --> 04:22.158
Hi. Um, we're with the police.

04:22.193 --> 04:24.686
- We're looking for the...
- Dead body?

04:24.721 --> 04:25.881
Take your pick.

04:25.916 --> 04:28.202
We got a whole store full of them.

04:28.237 --> 04:30.381
The police are in the back.

04:30.416 --> 04:32.418
On the loading dock.

04:45.681 --> 04:47.687
Ignore it.

04:50.129 --> 04:53.113
You don't have to pop them all.

04:53.148 --> 04:55.898
Monk, Sharona.

04:55.933 --> 04:58.450
- You having fun?
- No.

04:58.485 --> 05:00.581
- What have we got?
- It's pretty routine,

05:00.616 --> 05:01.687
an industrial accident.

05:01.722 --> 05:03.690
Yeah, her name was Edna coruthers.

05:03.725 --> 05:05.070
The manager says
she was a model employee,

05:05.105 --> 05:07.323
first one here,
last one to leave.

05:07.358 --> 05:12.115
He figured she was checking on
a delivery for a customer and, uh,

05:12.150 --> 05:15.425
42-inch flat-screen TV fell on her.

05:15.460 --> 05:16.665
She was killed instantly.

05:16.700 --> 05:17.745
That's horrible.

05:17.780 --> 05:19.860
Does the TV still work?

05:20.286 --> 05:23.577
Sharona...
the TV just killed a woman.

05:23.612 --> 05:26.017
What are you going to do,
lock it up?

05:29.038 --> 05:31.929
Tired? / Yeah, I was up all
last night with my girlfriend.

05:31.964 --> 05:35.474
Yeah, those imaginary girlfriends
can be pretty wild.

05:35.509 --> 05:38.317
- She's not imaginary.
- Ooh.

05:38.352 --> 05:41.291
- What's her name?
- Crystal.

05:43.371 --> 05:46.617
- What's her last name, Glassware?
- No, it's Smith.

05:46.652 --> 05:49.202
- Do you have a picture?
- Yeah.

05:49.781 --> 05:52.742
- Oh.
- She's pretty.

05:55.263 --> 05:58.329
- Randy, this came with the wallet.
- Yeah, I know.

05:58.364 --> 06:01.154
- She's a wallet model.
- That's sad.

06:01.189 --> 06:03.464
Sharona, she's one of the top five
wallet models in the world,

06:03.499 --> 06:04.712
thank you very much.

06:04.747 --> 06:07.883
Meanwhile, back on earth...

06:07.918 --> 06:10.383
I don't know why the D. A. called you.

06:10.418 --> 06:11.639
We're wrapping up our tent.

06:11.674 --> 06:12.775
There's nothing to see here.

06:12.810 --> 06:14.151
No, no, the D. A. didn't call me.

06:14.186 --> 06:15.906
It was the store security
manager, right?

06:15.941 --> 06:17.936
Yeah, I took the call,
but he didn't give me his name.

06:17.971 --> 06:19.968
Well, there's a reason for that, Monk.

06:20.003 --> 06:22.404
If you knew who it was,
you probably wouldn't be here.

06:22.439 --> 06:24.315
Who was it?

06:28.528 --> 06:29.543
Who's he?

06:29.578 --> 06:32.212
His name's Joe christie.
He's an ex-cop.

06:32.247 --> 06:34.994
Hey, as far as I'm concerned,
he never was a cop.

06:35.029 --> 06:35.928
What'd he do?

06:35.963 --> 06:38.836
He stole some drugs, got a couple
of good cops killed.

06:38.871 --> 06:40.337
Joe christie was my partner.

06:40.372 --> 06:44.114
Just after I left the department,

06:44.149 --> 06:45.892
he was promoted to major narcotics,

06:45.927 --> 06:51.639
and he arrested this dealer named Gutner
with 21/2 kilos of uncut cocaine.

06:51.674 --> 06:53.679
The drugs disappeared magically.

06:53.714 --> 06:55.470
They never made it to the evidence room.

06:55.505 --> 06:56.720
What about the cops?

06:56.755 --> 06:59.681
Well, without the drugs,
the dealer walked.

06:59.716 --> 07:02.768
He got pulled over a month later
for a routine traffic violation,

07:02.803 --> 07:05.181
and he shot two good cops.
I knew one of them.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.367
I knew them both.

07:06.402 --> 07:08.113
Well, somebody's got to
take his statement.

07:08.148 --> 07:10.075
No, no, no.
Not, not me.

07:10.110 --> 07:11.729
I go near him,
I deck him.

07:11.764 --> 07:15.043
- Fine, I'll do it.
- I'll go with you.

07:15.078 --> 07:19.962
You can tell me all about
Crystal, the famous wallet model.

07:20.946 --> 07:23.962
I can't believe anybody
even hired that guy.

07:23.997 --> 07:27.381
Well, he never was convicted of anything.

07:30.495 --> 07:33.594
So, uh, what, are you going
to pop all of these?

07:33.629 --> 07:35.678
No choice.

07:37.807 --> 07:39.011
You have to press down with your thumb.

07:39.046 --> 07:41.948
Monk, I know how to pop
bubble wrap. Thank you.

07:41.983 --> 07:45.773
Hey, Chandler, Roberto,
get over here.

07:45.808 --> 07:48.664
Start popping these.

07:50.774 --> 07:57.276
- Is there a reason why we're doing this?
- Nope. Just keep popping.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.687
Hey, I really appreciate this.

08:01.031 --> 08:03.374
Hey, he doesn't think
it was an accident.

08:03.409 --> 08:06.963
He says she was allergic to dust,
and she never came back here.

08:06.998 --> 08:10.057
Plus he found this.
It's a heel.

08:10.092 --> 08:12.422
He found it 15 yards from the body.

08:12.457 --> 08:14.262
He thinks she was running
from something.

08:14.297 --> 08:17.545
Nah, it just snapped off and
went flying. I've seen that before.

08:17.580 --> 08:18.762
Did she have any enemies?

08:18.797 --> 08:21.453
Not really, but the store did get
three complaints about her last month.

08:21.488 --> 08:23.184
Yeah, but from three different customers.

08:23.219 --> 08:24.574
They were all anonymous.

08:24.609 --> 08:26.913
- What did they say?
- Nothing much.

08:26.948 --> 08:30.270
Uh, she had alcohol on her breath,
she was rude to somebody...

08:30.305 --> 08:32.903
He wants you to check that out.

08:36.589 --> 08:41.361
No. No, I can't, can't do it.
I can't, I can't work with him.

08:46.330 --> 08:50.497
We're pouring two jigsaw
puzzles out, 500 pieces each.

08:50.532 --> 08:52.213
Now we're mixing them together.

08:52.248 --> 08:55.006
Okay, open your eyes.

08:55.815 --> 08:58.723
Ready...
Go.

09:03.422 --> 09:06.110
- Is he a robot?
- No, he's a person.

09:06.145 --> 09:07.927
Wow. What else can he do?

09:07.962 --> 09:13.157
He vacuums a lot,
and he solves murders.

09:13.534 --> 09:14.973
You could sell tickets to this.

09:15.008 --> 09:16.328
I know, I know.

09:16.363 --> 09:19.975
I want to, but my mom
won't let me.

09:20.010 --> 09:21.239
He's her boss.

09:21.274 --> 09:23.091
Benjy, what are you doing?

09:23.126 --> 09:24.312
He's not a toy.

09:24.347 --> 09:26.429
He doesn't care.
He likes it. Don't you, Mr. Monk?

09:26.464 --> 09:29.185
Oh, yeah. This one's
missing the corner.

09:32.752 --> 09:35.303
Do you think he could do three?

09:35.338 --> 09:37.831
Let's find out.

09:47.892 --> 09:51.654
- Uh-oh. We broke him.
- Adrian.

09:53.568 --> 09:58.026
- Hey, are you okay?
- Sharona...

09:58.061 --> 10:00.497
you don't still have those letters.

10:00.532 --> 10:01.941
What letters?

10:01.976 --> 10:04.895
The letters Joe christie gave us.

10:04.930 --> 10:06.736
I don't know.

10:06.771 --> 10:08.512
That was over a month ago.

10:08.547 --> 10:13.415
27 days.
A month. Close enough.

10:14.502 --> 10:17.669
Hey, it's your lucky day.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.303
They're right here.

10:29.409 --> 10:33.008
- What's he doing now?
- Oh, he's just thinking.

10:33.043 --> 10:36.646
- Want to play video games?
- Good idea.

10:44.589 --> 10:46.219
Morning, Jennie.

10:54.303 --> 10:56.054
Adrian.

10:57.270 --> 10:58.552
I gave up on you
three weeks ago.

10:58.587 --> 11:00.262
Thanks for coming.

11:01.975 --> 11:06.988
Are you not shaking because it's me
or because you still don't shake hands?

11:10.135 --> 11:12.492
Look, for whatever it's worth,
I didn't steal those drugs.

11:12.527 --> 11:13.618
They were never logged in.

11:13.653 --> 11:16.284
I logged them in.
That's all I know.

11:16.319 --> 11:18.659
I thought you, of all people, might
give me the benefit of the doubt.

11:18.694 --> 11:21.932
Look, I'm not here for you.

11:21.967 --> 11:24.183
I'm here for the woman who
was killed on the loading dock.

11:24.218 --> 11:26.774
Well, accordingto the M. E.,
What happened was an accident.

11:26.809 --> 11:31.006
Look, I noticed something about
the letters that you gave us.

11:31.041 --> 11:33.971
They all have different postmarks,
different handwriting,

11:34.006 --> 11:37.879
but they were sent by the same person.

11:37.914 --> 11:38.789
How do you know?

11:38.824 --> 11:41.189
The stamps are from the same roll.

11:41.224 --> 11:44.499
The edges are uneven...

11:44.534 --> 11:49.026
but they fit together
like puzzle pieces.

11:49.061 --> 11:51.596
I'll be damned.
You're still the man.

11:51.631 --> 11:54.351
Somebody was out to get her.

11:55.041 --> 11:56.971
Any ideas?

11:57.006 --> 11:58.722
It doesn't make sense.

11:58.757 --> 12:00.011
Edna lived alone.

12:00.046 --> 12:01.124
She never talked to anybody.

12:01.159 --> 12:02.699
All she had was this job.

12:02.734 --> 12:05.828
She was employee of the month
for 11 months in a row.

12:05.863 --> 12:11.952
Whoever did it knew her schedule
and how to lure her to the loading dock.

12:11.987 --> 12:15.018
It has to be somebody here in the store.

12:16.837 --> 12:20.051
That's what worries me.
Can you help me out?

12:20.867 --> 12:23.130
For old times' sake?

12:23.874 --> 12:26.196
Don't say that.

12:27.654 --> 12:29.278
I talked to home office in Sacramento.

12:29.313 --> 12:31.309
I have full authority
to hire anybody I want.

12:31.344 --> 12:33.813
Even if I wanted to poke around,

12:33.848 --> 12:36.320
no one's going to talk to me.

12:36.355 --> 12:40.207
What am I supposed to do, just hang out
in the mens wear department all day?

12:51.331 --> 12:54.754
Excuse me, where is the paint thinner?

12:54.789 --> 12:56.906
Aisle two, back of the store.

12:56.941 --> 12:59.737
- Thank you very much.
- Have a Mega Mart day.

13:13.151 --> 13:14.722
When I told home office
about my suspicion,

13:14.757 --> 13:17.572
they decided to beef up security.

13:17.607 --> 13:21.318
The dog is going to guard
the loading dock after hours.

13:21.353 --> 13:23.914
A yellow squirt gun was
found in the break room,

13:23.949 --> 13:25.982
and a three-pack of fish squirters.

13:26.017 --> 13:28.150
That's Brent donovan,
the shift manager.

13:28.185 --> 13:30.025
He's by the book,
he's married to the job.

13:30.060 --> 13:31.656
You know the type.

13:31.691 --> 13:33.280
Does he know about me?

13:33.315 --> 13:35.445
I'm not sure I trust him.

13:35.480 --> 13:38.164
Yeah. It's hard to know
who to trust.

13:38.199 --> 13:39.625
I didn't steal those drugs, Adrian.

13:39.660 --> 13:41.051
Do you want to hear my
side of the story or not?

13:41.086 --> 13:43.883
No. No, thank you.

13:43.918 --> 13:46.206
- Who are they?
- One is Ronnie, one is Morris.

13:46.241 --> 13:48.887
I forget which is which.
I'm not sure they know which is which.

13:48.922 --> 13:50.560
I mean, they've been here
a couple of months.

13:50.595 --> 13:53.310
They're not going to last long.

13:55.417 --> 14:00.067
Dear god, you might be
the best employee we have.

14:06.200 --> 14:07.871
Hi, hello. Welcome to Mega Mart.

14:07.906 --> 14:09.362
Thank you for shopping
at Mega Mart.

14:09.397 --> 14:11.828
Hi, hello. Thank you
for shopping at Mega Mart.

14:11.863 --> 14:13.528
Thank you for shopping
at Mega Mart.

14:13.563 --> 14:15.007
Hi, hello. Welcome.

14:15.042 --> 14:17.135
Thank you for waiting.
It is a madhouse today.

14:17.170 --> 14:20.697
I couldn't find them in brown,
but we do have the black.

14:20.732 --> 14:24.004
Hi, hello.
Welcome to Mega Mart.

14:25.852 --> 14:27.468
That is a wide foot.

14:27.503 --> 14:29.083
Thank you for shopping
at Mega Mart.

14:29.118 --> 14:32.678
- Deodorant, aisle 4.
- What?

14:32.713 --> 14:36.907
- Why would you say that?
- No reason.

14:40.595 --> 14:42.942
Thank you for...

14:42.977 --> 14:46.987
Okay, well, why don't you
walk around, give them a try?

14:47.022 --> 14:50.072
And we are looking at...

14:50.107 --> 14:52.958
101/2 wide there.

14:53.630 --> 14:58.076
Cleanup on aisle four.
Cleanup on aisle four.

14:58.111 --> 15:00.208
I got it!
I got it. Mine.

15:00.243 --> 15:01.454
Coming through.
I called it.

15:01.489 --> 15:04.642
Coming through.
Excuse me. It's mine.

15:06.124 --> 15:08.699
Who is that man?

15:29.204 --> 15:32.352
What is your problem?

15:48.789 --> 15:50.657
It doesn't have to be perfect.

15:50.692 --> 15:52.385
Well, as long as we're here,

15:52.420 --> 15:54.389
we might as well do the job right.

15:54.424 --> 15:56.525
I said the same thing
when I started.

15:56.560 --> 15:58.755
When was that?

15:58.790 --> 16:01.274
I don't remember.

16:01.309 --> 16:04.129
Did you know Edna coruthers?

16:04.164 --> 16:06.441
Everybody knew Edna.

16:06.476 --> 16:08.285
I hate to speak ill of the dead,

16:08.320 --> 16:10.410
but she was a royal pain
in the rump,

16:10.445 --> 16:13.002
always coming in early,
working late.

16:13.037 --> 16:15.674
She was making the rest
of us look bad.

16:15.709 --> 16:18.066
Did she ever argue or fight
with anyone?

16:18.101 --> 16:20.718
She'd argue with anybody
who messed up her department.

16:20.753 --> 16:22.670
I worked with her
over in housewares.

16:22.705 --> 16:25.592
Everything had to be spic and span.

16:25.627 --> 16:28.070
She was a regular profectionist.

16:28.105 --> 16:30.982
You mean perfectionist.

16:33.054 --> 16:38.046
I'm not one, so I can say
it any damn way I want.

16:44.313 --> 16:46.354
Great, okay,
you almost got it.

16:46.389 --> 16:48.073
Just a little bit higher.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.364
All right, buddy, okay.

16:50.399 --> 16:51.983
He's right there,
right there.

16:52.018 --> 16:54.855
You rock.
You rock, dude.

16:55.532 --> 16:58.702
Try for the cheese crackers.

16:58.737 --> 17:00.121
Can't reach it.

17:00.156 --> 17:02.929
- How about chuckles?
- Nah.

17:02.964 --> 17:04.426
Try for the barbecue chips.

17:04.462 --> 17:07.210
Dude, you have longer arms.
Why don't you do it?

17:07.244 --> 17:09.220
What are you doing?

17:09.255 --> 17:11.041
Uh, I, I dropped a quarter.

17:11.077 --> 17:12.758
Donovan's looking
for you guys.

17:12.792 --> 17:14.185
Yeah, well, we're on break.

17:14.221 --> 17:16.257
You already took your break.
If you're not out there in two minutes,

17:16.291 --> 17:18.167
I'm going to report you both.

17:19.588 --> 17:21.298
What a tool!

17:21.333 --> 17:22.848
Who is she?

17:22.884 --> 17:24.941
Jennie silvertool.

17:24.976 --> 17:27.310
She used to be cool. Remember
when she used to cover for us?

17:27.346 --> 17:28.549
Yeah, yeah.

17:28.584 --> 17:30.694
She used to hang out in
the parking lot with us,

17:30.729 --> 17:33.072
- Sipping on some brews.
- What happened?

17:33.107 --> 17:34.651
Maybe she got religion.

17:34.686 --> 17:36.285
Yeah, 'cause, like,
two months ago,

17:36.320 --> 17:41.451
she suddenly started punching in early
and working all late and stuff like that.

17:53.979 --> 17:55.602
Hmm.

17:55.637 --> 17:59.052
Looks like you have
some competition.

18:06.067 --> 18:08.270
This is basically hose central,

18:08.305 --> 18:10.015
so if you got a hose,

18:10.050 --> 18:11.860
this is where it goes.

18:11.895 --> 18:14.635
- Mr. Donovan is very, very...
- Down.

18:14.670 --> 18:17.852
What is it?
What?

18:17.887 --> 18:20.370
- Dude, those are the guys.
- What guys?

18:20.405 --> 18:22.333
The guys who beat me up
in the parking lot.

18:22.368 --> 18:25.501
When was this?

18:25.536 --> 18:27.667
Couple of months ago.

18:27.702 --> 18:30.359
No, wait, it was...
last week.

18:30.394 --> 18:33.673
You know, I was putting the promotional
flyers all over the windshields and stuff.

18:33.708 --> 18:35.426
These two dudes came
up from nowhere,

18:35.461 --> 18:36.948
just started pounding on me.

18:36.983 --> 18:39.233
Beat the bejesus out of me.

18:39.268 --> 18:41.905
- Did they take your money?
- No, man.

18:41.940 --> 18:43.040
They were just beating me up.

18:43.075 --> 18:45.060
Wailing on me, no reason.

18:45.095 --> 18:47.897
And you're sure it was them.

18:49.408 --> 18:53.659
Not 100%.
To be honest with you, at the time,

18:53.694 --> 18:55.960
I wasn't what you'd
really call sober.

18:55.995 --> 18:58.521
Dude, it's ancient history.
Don't dwell on it.

18:58.556 --> 19:00.798
Let's take a break.

19:00.833 --> 19:03.772
- I got your back.
- You're right.

19:16.727 --> 19:20.702
You, uh, find everything
you were looking for? / Sure.

19:28.285 --> 19:34.122
- Wouldn't you rather pay cash?
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

19:36.246 --> 19:39.029
What's going on?

19:39.064 --> 19:43.812
I don't know. She just typed in their zip
code without asking what it was.

19:43.847 --> 19:47.373
She knows them, but she's
pretending not to.

19:47.408 --> 19:48.593
What do you know about her?

19:48.628 --> 19:49.496
That's Jennie silverman.

19:49.531 --> 19:51.289
She's the best employee we got.

19:51.324 --> 19:53.957
They just offered her a management position
at the new store in Livingston,

19:53.992 --> 19:55.832
and she turned it down.

19:55.867 --> 20:00.383
- Why would she do that?
- I don't know.

20:00.418 --> 20:04.035
Maybe she has friends here
she's loyal to.

20:05.127 --> 20:07.183
Those two cops were married,

20:07.218 --> 20:09.511
and one of them had kids.

20:11.268 --> 20:13.437
I'm loyal to them.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.228
I've never seen you this quiet.

21:06.263 --> 21:08.996
What's on your mind?

21:10.501 --> 21:14.152
I'm working on a case.

21:14.187 --> 21:17.713
I'm in a store working undercover.

21:17.748 --> 21:19.839
Mm. Sounds interesting.

21:19.874 --> 21:24.756
It's the Mega Mart
on columbus avenue.

21:24.791 --> 21:27.466
Mm-hmm.

21:27.501 --> 21:29.193
I saw you in there yesterday.

21:29.228 --> 21:31.434
Yeah, I, I sometimes stop
there on the way home.

21:31.469 --> 21:33.917
Why didn't you say hi?

21:35.853 --> 21:38.328
I saw you...

21:38.363 --> 21:40.541
You saw me what?

21:43.945 --> 21:46.396
You stole a granola bar.

21:46.431 --> 21:50.650
You took a bite and you
put it in your pocket.

21:50.685 --> 21:53.085
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Adrian,

21:53.120 --> 21:55.408
that, that really hurts me.

21:55.443 --> 21:57.750
It hurts me, too.

21:59.057 --> 22:01.320
I am not a thief.

22:01.355 --> 22:04.001
I had that bar with me
when I went into the store.

22:04.036 --> 22:07.169
I, I carry them in my pocket all
the time just to keep upmy energy.

22:07.204 --> 22:09.489
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

22:10.561 --> 22:12.804
So there's, um...

22:12.839 --> 22:14.355
there's one in your pocket right now?

22:14.390 --> 22:16.891
Yes, Adrian, there is one
in my pocket right now,

22:16.926 --> 22:19.617
and I hope I do not have to
take it out to prove it to you.

22:19.652 --> 22:22.619
I, I.../ you know, Adrian,
I see this all the time.

22:22.654 --> 22:25.745
I work with cops,
I work with ex-cops. You...

22:25.780 --> 22:28.267
You see terrible things.

22:28.302 --> 22:29.424
People lie to you.

22:29.459 --> 22:31.319
After a while, you don't
believe anything.

22:31.354 --> 22:33.865
- I, I, I, I, I...
- Adrian,

22:33.900 --> 22:35.992
you're going to
have to make the leap.

22:36.027 --> 22:37.030
You're going to have to trust.

22:37.065 --> 22:39.015
Otherwise, you're going
to be completely alone,

22:39.050 --> 22:42.456
and I hope that that
doesn't happen to you.

22:47.795 --> 22:50.355
You're right.

22:50.390 --> 22:53.086
- I'm sorry.
- All right.

22:55.980 --> 22:59.356
Okay, let's, um...

22:59.391 --> 23:01.511
talk about the case.

23:04.540 --> 23:08.012
A woman was killed in the store.

23:08.047 --> 23:10.486
Officially, it's been
called an accident.

23:10.521 --> 23:12.231
You're working in the store.

23:12.266 --> 23:14.380
Yes. It's going pretty well.

23:14.415 --> 23:17.860
Mr. Donovan, the shift manager,

23:17.895 --> 23:20.755
said he might move me
up to register one.

23:20.790 --> 23:24.596
Mm-hmm.

23:25.961 --> 23:30.516
Oh.
Thank god.

23:33.874 --> 23:39.058
Of course...
I, I knew it.

23:39.093 --> 23:43.145
- I knew it all along.
- Of course you did. Yeah.

23:56.940 --> 23:59.460
You planning a trip?

24:00.091 --> 24:02.381
Excuse me?

24:02.416 --> 24:04.288
Couldn't help but notice

24:04.323 --> 24:05.793
you're taking quinine.

24:05.828 --> 24:08.922
Malaria pills.

24:08.957 --> 24:10.725
- Who are you?
- I'm Adrian.

24:10.760 --> 24:12.677
I know your name. I can see
your name, but who are you?

24:12.712 --> 24:15.370
I'm just a curious person.

24:15.405 --> 24:17.149
It's a gift and a curse.

24:17.184 --> 24:18.971
For example, yesterday,

24:19.006 --> 24:22.557
you were ringing up a customer.
You pretended not to know him,

24:22.592 --> 24:25.676
but you knew his zip code.

24:26.853 --> 24:29.237
I don't know
what you're talking about.

24:34.698 --> 24:36.532
That curiosity of yours...

24:36.567 --> 24:40.698
It's not a gift and a curse.
It's a curse.

24:51.207 --> 24:56.958
Attention, Mega Mart customers!
Door will be closing in 10 minutes.

25:59.707 --> 26:01.698
Good, good, good dog.

26:01.733 --> 26:04.055
You're a fine little fella.

26:04.090 --> 26:07.221
See, here's the, the thing.

26:07.256 --> 26:08.449
I'm working undercover.

26:08.484 --> 26:10.333
There was this woman,
Edna coruthers.

26:10.368 --> 26:12.795
She was killed on the loading dock,

26:12.830 --> 26:16.128
and I think it might have
been premeditated.

26:28.177 --> 26:29.402
Hey.

26:30.730 --> 26:32.054
Where's Adrian?

26:32.089 --> 26:35.249
I don't know.
He said he'd meet us here.

26:36.077 --> 26:40.118
So you want to sit down?

26:40.153 --> 26:41.913
Sure.

26:44.254 --> 26:47.080
Got that information you wanted
on Jennie silverman.

26:47.115 --> 26:48.361
Her adult record was clean,

26:48.396 --> 26:52.237
but she spent some time in juvie.

26:52.272 --> 26:56.547
Uh, age 15, she had minor-league
possession and trespassing,

26:56.582 --> 26:59.187
and at age 16, she stole a car.

26:59.222 --> 27:01.304
I thought juvenile records were sealed.

27:01.339 --> 27:04.489
Yeah, well, there's a clerk
downtown named Ned,

27:04.524 --> 27:09.503
who has four cats and lives with
his mom, and he bought me a drink.

27:09.538 --> 27:10.742
I don't get paid enough.

27:10.777 --> 27:12.310
Monk was right.
You are good.

27:12.345 --> 27:15.494
I'm glad you have his back.

27:15.529 --> 27:18.056
Take care of him.

27:18.091 --> 27:21.500
Can I ask you something?

27:21.535 --> 27:24.768
What was he like as a cop?

27:24.803 --> 27:27.383
I remember the day we met.

27:27.418 --> 27:30.640
I walked down the hall to shake his hand,
this was, you know, back

27:30.675 --> 27:32.192
when he was shaking hands.

27:32.227 --> 27:34.786
And there were seven detectives
lined up outside his office

27:34.821 --> 27:36.286
just waiting to run cases by him,

27:36.321 --> 27:39.540
just to see what he thought,
just to pick his brain.

27:39.575 --> 27:41.348
I learned more from
Adrian monk in two days

27:41.383 --> 27:45.515
than I did in the two years
that I was at the academy.

27:46.268 --> 27:47.553
Were you there when Trudy...

27:47.588 --> 27:50.991
Yeah, yeah, I was there
when he got the call.

27:51.026 --> 27:54.095
He was laughing
when the phone rang,

27:54.130 --> 27:57.095
and he never laughed again.

28:01.246 --> 28:02.155
Where is he?

28:02.190 --> 28:05.925
The last I saw him, he was in the
shoe department putting boxes away.

28:05.960 --> 28:07.900
- He's putting boxes away?
- Yeah.

28:07.935 --> 28:09.428
Oh, god.

28:09.463 --> 28:13.029
I think we better start ordering.

29:26.372 --> 29:27.449
Oh, it's the store.

29:27.484 --> 29:29.796
Well, ask him what's keeping him.

29:29.831 --> 29:31.544
Hello?

29:34.211 --> 29:38.052
Randy?
What the hell is...

29:40.353 --> 29:43.393
- Come on.
- What? /- Come on.

29:52.314 --> 29:54.979
Hey!
Over here! Over here, huh?

29:55.014 --> 29:56.453
Huh? Fresh meat.

29:56.488 --> 29:59.165
Fresh meat!
Come on! Come on!

30:02.583 --> 30:03.643
Are you okay?

30:04.725 --> 30:07.406
Sure. I think so.
Joe, are you okay?

30:07.441 --> 30:08.879
I'll live.

30:08.914 --> 30:10.780
He must have got out of
the loading dock.

30:10.815 --> 30:12.590
Or maybe somebody let him out.

30:13.968 --> 30:16.676
Thank you.

30:16.711 --> 30:18.420
Forget it.

30:22.224 --> 30:25.878
Hey...
He saved your life.

30:26.670 --> 30:29.371
Maybe you can return the favor.

30:36.786 --> 30:38.718
So you two are pals again?

30:38.753 --> 30:41.941
I just, I just want to give him
the benefit of the doubt.

30:41.976 --> 30:43.734
He is a dirty cop, Monk.

30:43.769 --> 30:45.689
Maybe. Maybe.

30:45.724 --> 30:46.846
Are you wearing cologne?

30:46.881 --> 30:49.007
Yeah, Crystal got it for me.

30:49.603 --> 30:52.077
Hey, captain,
you ever met Crystal?

30:52.112 --> 30:54.379
No, I can't say that I have.

30:54.838 --> 30:57.632
We were supposed to go
out to dinner last week,

30:57.667 --> 30:59.205
but she canceled
at the last minute.

30:59.240 --> 31:02.362
- She wasn't feeling well.
- Mm-hmm.

31:02.397 --> 31:03.886
Maybe you blew
her up too much.

31:03.921 --> 31:06.899
She's not a balloon.
Oh, that's right.

31:06.934 --> 31:10.716
- She's a living, breathing wallet model.
- Here we go.

31:10.751 --> 31:15.277
Internal affairs division,
case number 922.

31:15.312 --> 31:17.759
Detective lieutenant Joseph christie.

31:19.003 --> 31:20.363
What's, what's this?

31:20.398 --> 31:22.424
That, my friend, is the evidence room.

31:22.459 --> 31:23.853
Bin number four.

31:23.888 --> 31:26.345
That's where your pal said
that he put all of the cocaine.

31:26.380 --> 31:28.996
As you can plainly see,
bin number four is empty.

31:29.031 --> 31:32.490
Okay, wait. Some of these items were
sold at a police auction / Yep!

31:32.525 --> 31:34.499
- a few days later?
- That's routine.

31:35.710 --> 31:39.625
Three televisions, one boy's
bicycle, two computers.

31:39.660 --> 31:41.951
So?

31:41.986 --> 31:46.004
Wait. Wait. Look.
Look.

31:46.039 --> 31:47.753
Look at this bicycle.

31:47.788 --> 31:49.326
Well, that's a girl's bike.

31:49.361 --> 31:51.338
There's no metal bar.

31:51.373 --> 31:55.236
But when it was sold
two days later,

31:55.271 --> 31:57.127
it was a boy's bike.

31:57.679 --> 32:00.690
Somebody added that metal tube.

32:00.725 --> 32:03.193
Do we know who bought
that boy's bike?

32:04.766 --> 32:06.233
Yeah, it's right here.

32:06.268 --> 32:09.397
Item 422, boy's bike,
sold to Clara toplin.

32:09.432 --> 32:11.195
Toplin.

32:11.230 --> 32:14.354
Clara toplin used to be the
properties clerk here.

32:14.389 --> 32:18.458
She quit about four years ago.

32:19.988 --> 32:22.372
That's right.

32:32.556 --> 32:35.553
It's four years old, but
the residue's still there.

32:35.588 --> 32:38.519
It tests positive for
cocaine hydrochloride.

32:38.554 --> 32:40.742
Guess you should have gotten
rid of the bike, Clara.

32:40.777 --> 32:43.844
I was saving it for my grandson.

32:43.879 --> 32:45.982
You're under arrest.

32:50.909 --> 32:53.158
Joe...

32:53.193 --> 32:55.981
I don't know what to say.

32:57.815 --> 32:59.621
I'm sorry.

33:02.086 --> 33:04.051
That's a good start.

33:09.593 --> 33:11.198
Come on.

33:19.069 --> 33:21.263
You don't want to wipe that off?

33:22.992 --> 33:26.421
No.
I don't.

33:27.737 --> 33:29.453
Let's get back to work.

33:35.620 --> 33:38.505
Well, this will come as no
big surprise to anybody,

33:38.540 --> 33:44.586
but our employee of the month
for the second straight month is...

33:44.621 --> 33:46.414
Drum roll, please.

33:47.794 --> 33:51.083
It's Jennie silverman.
Well done, Jennie.

33:51.118 --> 33:55.428
And as winner, Jennie will enjoy
another month of special privileges.

33:55.463 --> 34:00.170
the employee of the month parking spot
right in front of the main entrance,

34:00.205 --> 34:02.772
of course, the Mega Mart mug,

34:03.309 --> 34:10.813
the, uh, gift certificate for dinner for
two at the lobster barrel on 17th street.

34:10.848 --> 34:13.735
Good only on weekdays and
does not include lobster.

34:13.771 --> 34:17.210
And the winner's plaque,

34:17.245 --> 34:21.655
which will be on display right at the
main entrance for the entire month,

34:21.690 --> 34:26.697
which should inspire all of us
to reach deep inside us

34:26.732 --> 34:30.069
so we can find it,
the best inside us

34:30.103 --> 34:33.339
so we can do the best.

34:34.882 --> 34:39.821
Well said. / Didn't Edna die
at the end of last month?

34:39.856 --> 34:41.647
Yeah, that's right.

34:43.677 --> 34:45.226
Here we go.

34:45.262 --> 34:46.829
I can't believe I found this.

34:49.362 --> 34:53.193
This is the performance chart
from last month.

34:53.980 --> 34:56.063
See, Edna was out front.

34:56.099 --> 34:57.939
She would have won.

34:57.974 --> 35:00.773
You're not suggesting that
somebody was killed because of this.

35:02.005 --> 35:04.293
You're saying Jennie silverman
committed cold-blooded murder

35:04.328 --> 35:06.247
just so she could be
employee of the month?

35:07.463 --> 35:09.050
Why?

35:10.817 --> 35:12.879
I don't know.

35:18.213 --> 35:22.567
As employee of the month,
she gets a ceramic mug,

35:22.602 --> 35:26.025
dinner for two at the
world-famous lobster barrel,

35:26.060 --> 35:27.405
and a plaque.

35:27.440 --> 35:29.897
And, of course, the thanks
of a grateful nation.

35:30.985 --> 35:33.584
Do you really think there's
something here worth killing for?

35:33.619 --> 35:35.802
Oh, yes. It's here.

35:35.837 --> 35:37.950
We just can't see it.

35:39.939 --> 35:40.857
What do you think?

35:40.892 --> 35:42.707
I think Edna was obviously
killed for this mug.

35:42.742 --> 35:44.540
Really? / No.

35:44.575 --> 35:46.746
Well, maybe it's made out
of gold and painted over.

35:46.781 --> 35:49.101
Joe...

35:49.136 --> 35:51.637
Hey, you said try 300
theories until one fits.

35:51.672 --> 35:52.680
I said that?

35:52.715 --> 35:55.089
Yeah, I remember everything
you ever said, god help me.

35:55.124 --> 35:56.425
It wasn't about the mug.

35:56.460 --> 35:57.756
What's next?

35:57.791 --> 35:59.376
Dinner for two at the lobster barrel.

35:59.411 --> 36:00.842
Tell me about the lobster barrel.

36:00.877 --> 36:02.184
It's a family place.

36:02.219 --> 36:03.646
It's noisy, there's a million kids.

36:03.681 --> 36:05.149
You wouldn't last five minutes there.

36:05.184 --> 36:08.325
It's got a great all-you-can-eat buffet
with seven different kinds of shrimp.

36:08.360 --> 36:11.396
They got jumbo shrimp, batter-dipped
shrimp, tempura shrimp...

36:11.431 --> 36:13.984
Okay, stop telling me about
the lobster barrel.

36:14.019 --> 36:15.994
Barbecue shrimp../Stop!

36:16.029 --> 36:17.063
What's next?

36:17.098 --> 36:19.246
89 cent plastic commemorative plaque.

36:19.281 --> 36:20.482
Would you kill somebody to get this?

36:20.517 --> 36:22.204
I'd kill somebody not to get it.

36:23.245 --> 36:25.256
That's it.
That's what she gets.

36:26.401 --> 36:29.946
Except, of course,
for the parking space.

36:32.841 --> 36:34.224
There it is.

36:44.688 --> 36:46.383
Did you see that?

36:46.418 --> 36:47.894
What, the speed bump?

36:47.929 --> 36:50.312
Trucks are always scraping it
when they're loaded down.

36:50.347 --> 36:53.467
I saw Jennie's van scrape
it two days ago.

36:54.148 --> 36:56.241
You're right.
I've seen it, too.

36:56.276 --> 37:00.016
But the first time I saw her,
in the morning,

37:00.051 --> 37:02.554
the van didn't scrape at all.

37:02.589 --> 37:05.950
You remember a vehicle not
scraping on a speed bump?

37:05.985 --> 37:07.368
Damn, I've missed you.

37:07.403 --> 37:11.863
Her van is always heavier
at the end of the day. Why?

37:11.898 --> 37:15.083
- It's loaded down.
- With what?

37:24.379 --> 37:25.902
Oh, my god.

37:25.937 --> 37:27.475
Do you remember her two friends?

37:27.510 --> 37:30.598
They were buying
shovels and drill bits.

37:30.633 --> 37:32.639
There's a sewer grate
right under the van.

37:32.674 --> 37:34.108
It was loaded down with dirt.

37:34.143 --> 37:36.494
They're digging into the vault.
They're robbing the bank.

37:36.529 --> 37:38.187
She wanted that parking space.

37:38.222 --> 37:39.857
That's what this whole thing
has been about.

37:39.892 --> 37:42.336
Monk, I've been looking for you.

37:42.371 --> 37:43.767
Mr. Donovan, where's Jennie?

37:43.802 --> 37:45.768
Never mind Jennie. You're
supposed to be in housewares.

37:45.803 --> 37:47.256
There's inventory piled up...

37:47.291 --> 37:48.633
This is police business.
Do you understand?

37:48.668 --> 37:50.847
My partner asked you a question.

37:51.949 --> 37:53.672
Was that an earthquake?

37:56.402 --> 37:58.500
They blew the vault.
It's going down now.

37:58.535 --> 38:01.294
That makes sense. First of the month.
The bank's probably loaded with cash.

38:01.329 --> 38:03.247
- What are you talking about?
- I'll call it in.

38:03.282 --> 38:04.816
No, no, no. They'll
never make it in time.

38:04.851 --> 38:06.214
Joe, I need a gun.

38:06.249 --> 38:08.003
Sporting goods, aisle seven.

38:11.185 --> 38:15.594
Gun? / What the hell is going on in here?
Let's go, go, go!

38:16.617 --> 38:19.329
Hey!
Hey, Ronnie, Ronnie.

38:19.364 --> 38:20.788
Yes?
Listen to me.

38:20.823 --> 38:22.951
No, man, he's Ronnie.

38:22.986 --> 38:26.116
Yeah, we switched name tags
to see if anybody would notice.

38:26.151 --> 38:28.369
But don't tell anyone, because
it's like an experiment, so...

38:28.404 --> 38:30.078
I'm in a rush here. I need a gun.

38:30.113 --> 38:32.982
Oh, you finally decided to use
your employee discount, huh?

38:33.017 --> 38:35.365
All right, Mr. Monk,
what do you want?

38:35.400 --> 38:36.753
We got these...
I don't care!

38:36.788 --> 38:37.883
Just give me something.

38:37.918 --> 38:39.019
Look, it's a police emergency.

38:39.054 --> 38:40.014
I'll bring it right back.

38:40.049 --> 38:41.464
I just need it for two minutes, okay?

38:41.499 --> 38:42.852
Yeah, that's going to be a problem,

38:42.887 --> 38:46.184
because that's against, like,
a million federal laws and regulations.

38:46.219 --> 38:48.765
Yeah, there's supposed to be,
like, a waiting period or something.

38:48.800 --> 38:50.113
- Please...
- No, but you know what?

38:50.148 --> 38:52.263
We'll get you started on your
paperwork. / No paperwork.

38:52.298 --> 38:55.736
No, no, no. No paper...
No, / I'll be right back.

38:55.771 --> 38:59.937
It's.../ Stay off the glass there.
I just washed that.

38:59.972 --> 39:02.437
What the hell were you doing in there?

39:02.472 --> 39:04.993
- This stuff's heavy.
- Good.

39:05.028 --> 39:06.852
Good. Heavy's good.

39:08.175 --> 39:10.523
If it was up to us, dude,
you could totally have it,

39:10.558 --> 39:13.149
but, uh, Mr. Donovan's been
riding us a lot lately.

39:13.184 --> 39:16.069
Yeah, like yesterday, when we
were in housewares...

39:16.104 --> 39:17.247
For the love of god,

39:17.282 --> 39:19.033
it's Jennie silverman!
She's getting away.

39:19.068 --> 39:22.215
Oh. Oh, it's for Jennie?

39:22.250 --> 39:24.795
Yeah, we both had the same thought.

39:24.830 --> 39:26.493
Jennie's a real tool.

39:26.528 --> 39:28.387
Yeah, but, man, this is not the answer.

39:28.422 --> 39:31.313
- Whoa!
- Morris...

39:31.348 --> 39:33.888
- He's Morris.
- Ronnie...

39:33.923 --> 39:35.158
give me the ammo.

39:35.193 --> 39:37.226
Okay, okay.
Calm down, man.

39:39.301 --> 39:42.133
Yo, it wasn't even loaded.

39:42.168 --> 39:44.115
I quit.

39:52.915 --> 39:55.541
It's loaded!
Get back!

40:12.028 --> 40:14.094
Loud.

40:15.926 --> 40:17.901
Get out of the car!

40:17.936 --> 40:19.218
Away from the vehicle!

40:19.253 --> 40:21.241
Put your hands up where
I can see them! Hands up!

40:21.276 --> 40:23.019
Hands over your head,

40:23.054 --> 40:25.264
you in the driver's seat!

40:28.348 --> 40:31.145
Detective Joe christie,

40:31.180 --> 40:32.438
welcome back.

40:33.583 --> 40:36.777
We could sure use you.
Congratulations.

40:38.218 --> 40:40.028
Thank you, brother.

40:40.063 --> 40:42.881
I wouldn't be here if
it wasn't for you.

40:42.916 --> 40:45.054
You'll be next.

40:45.089 --> 40:46.694
She's right.

40:46.729 --> 40:49.417
And when you make it back,

40:49.452 --> 40:50.462
I get to ride with you.

40:50.497 --> 40:55.344
Hey! Sharona, captain, everyone,
could you all come with me, please?

40:55.379 --> 40:56.388
Everybody, come here.

40:56.423 --> 40:57.971
I want to show you guys something.

40:58.006 --> 41:00.923
- What is it?
- Crystal. She's downstairs.

41:00.958 --> 41:02.312
Why didn't you tell her
to come up here?

41:02.347 --> 41:03.294
She couldn't stay.

41:03.329 --> 41:05.650
She's flying to Aruba
for a photo shoot.

41:05.685 --> 41:08.095
- So sad.
- There she is.

41:08.130 --> 41:10.610
- Where?
- In the taxi.

41:12.168 --> 41:14.614
- Hey! Crystal!
- It's so pathetic...

41:14.649 --> 41:17.457
- Huh, she's waving.
- Goodbye, Randy! I love you!

41:17.492 --> 41:20.937
- I miss you already.
- See?

41:20.972 --> 41:23.300
Where are you going?
She's right here!

41:24.892 --> 41:26.793
What?

41:26.828 --> 41:30.599
Oh, come on. She was just...
I swear to god, she was just here!
