WEBVTT

00:07.079 --> 00:10.479
Before I met you, I
was a civilised woman.

00:16.015 --> 00:17.216
Civilised.

00:21.359 --> 00:24.439
Now, I don't even know what that means.

00:29.386 --> 00:31.785
Food, shelter, sex,

00:31.786 --> 00:35.306
once those needs are covered,
we can pretend we're in control.

00:37.666 --> 00:40.066
That the lives we build keep us human.

00:47.506 --> 00:49.506
But, really, we're all just animals.

00:53.426 --> 00:54.786
You know how I know that?

00:57.866 --> 00:58.905
Fear.

01:06.946 --> 01:08.306
Fear for your life.

01:14.061 --> 01:16.460
Once you've felt that,

01:16.485 --> 01:19.145
everything else,

01:19.146 --> 01:21.638
all this so-called civilisation...

01:23.146 --> 01:24.786
...it's a dream.

01:26.138 --> 01:27.898
You've taught me that, my love.

01:29.191 --> 01:31.151
Would the defendant please stand?

01:33.226 --> 01:34.866
'Fear makes animals of us all.'

01:47.746 --> 01:50.465
In terms of our research,
we're pushing at frontiers

01:50.466 --> 01:53.385
and there are bound to be anxieties
around that. I do understand.

01:53.386 --> 01:57.385
But, to be frank, most of those
anxieties are completely unfounded.

01:57.386 --> 02:00.585
So everything we're
hearing about Frankenfoods...?

02:00.799 --> 02:04.518
They're still foods and how
they're processed and regulated,

02:04.519 --> 02:05.998
that's crucial, obviously.

02:05.999 --> 02:09.598
But that's a question for
Government or business, not science.

02:09.598 --> 02:12.838
Listen, the more we learn about DNA,

02:12.839 --> 02:16.358
the more avenues there
are for gene therapy,

02:16.359 --> 02:18.005
which could lead to the eradication

02:18.030 --> 02:19.869
of genetically-based illness

02:19.894 --> 02:21.771
and that has to be a
tremendous positive.

02:21.796 --> 02:24.355
But you can reassure us, professor,

02:24.380 --> 02:27.734
no ten-foot mice on the cards,

02:27.759 --> 02:29.878
or triangular cows?

02:29.879 --> 02:33.718
The work we're doing is never
going to result in corn with udders.

02:35.719 --> 02:38.838
Hi, it's me. Just to say they're
done with me, so you don't need

02:38.839 --> 02:41.500
to be home in time for
the Tesco delivery...

02:41.525 --> 02:42.924
Um, that's it.

02:42.949 --> 02:45.079
Oh, and I'll cook, by the way. See ya.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:54.466 --> 02:56.785
We won't be seeing you
this afternoon, then,

02:56.786 --> 02:57.951
Professor Carmichael?

02:57.976 --> 03:00.745
No. David moved up the
technology questions

03:00.746 --> 03:03.425
- so that I'd be finished by lunchtime.
- Oh.

03:03.426 --> 03:05.197
Efficiency in the civil service,

03:05.222 --> 03:06.862
there's a novelty.

03:15.913 --> 03:18.225
- Hi.
- Anything else?

03:18.226 --> 03:20.306
Uh, no, that's it, thank you.

03:23.878 --> 03:26.397
You were very articulate
in there, professor.

03:26.422 --> 03:27.425
Thanks.

03:27.426 --> 03:29.945
The first time I've ever
understood what a genome is.

03:29.946 --> 03:33.225
Oh, good! Um, well, I do...
I do a lot of lecturing,

03:33.226 --> 03:35.065
but it's not professor, actually.

03:35.066 --> 03:36.305
Ah.

03:36.306 --> 03:39.065
- That's more American, is it?
- Exactly, yes.

03:39.066 --> 03:41.425
I get that because of
the mad scientist thing.

03:41.426 --> 03:43.065
You know, Nutty Professor.

03:43.066 --> 03:45.465
Right, well, I can see,
obviously, you're deranged.

03:46.347 --> 03:47.865
So have you appeared in front

03:47.866 --> 03:49.705
of the Select Committee before?

03:49.706 --> 03:52.368
A couple of times, actually, yes.

03:52.393 --> 03:54.672
Governments get really
het up about genetics,

03:54.697 --> 03:58.065
whichever lot are in, you
know, modification, cloning.

03:58.066 --> 04:00.785
Do you get nervous, speaking in
front of a group of people like that?

04:00.786 --> 04:02.865
I only say that because
you didn't seem it at all.

04:02.866 --> 04:04.207
- Didn't I?
- No, not at all.

04:04.232 --> 04:05.777
- Um...
- Thanks, Nick.

04:05.802 --> 04:08.585
No, I suppose I don't, really.

04:08.586 --> 04:11.105
Well, not in front of MPs anyway.

04:13.146 --> 04:14.647
I think I know more
about it than they do.

04:14.671 --> 04:15.785
Right. Yeah, well,

04:15.786 --> 04:18.865
you know, that's a relief
cos I'd be worried to think

04:18.866 --> 04:21.665
that MPs set themselves
up as experts on anything.

04:21.666 --> 04:23.385
Are you allowed to say that in here?

04:23.386 --> 04:25.466
Oh, off the record you are, yeah. Yeah.

04:26.466 --> 04:28.346
Well, all right.

04:30.066 --> 04:31.426
- That's me.
- Oh...

04:32.666 --> 04:34.546
...have you seen the Chapel in the Crypt?

04:36.066 --> 04:37.225
No.

04:37.226 --> 04:38.855
Wait one second.

04:51.706 --> 04:52.985
Sorted.

04:52.986 --> 04:55.665
Just remind me to give those
back to Martha afterwards

04:55.666 --> 04:58.905
cos my life will not be worth
living, even if you are a VIP.

04:58.906 --> 05:01.025
So are you OK for time?

05:01.026 --> 05:02.665
- Uh, yeah, sure.
- Sure?

05:02.666 --> 05:03.826
This way.

05:06.331 --> 05:09.465
It's strictly by-appointment
and Members can use it.

05:09.466 --> 05:12.066
They have christenings. You
can even get married here.

05:20.426 --> 05:21.746
Wow.

05:25.356 --> 05:27.665
It's a Royal Peculiar.

05:27.666 --> 05:31.145
It means it's under the monarch's
control via the Lord Chamberlain

05:31.146 --> 05:33.585
and that's Great Lord
Chamberlain to you.

05:35.466 --> 05:40.345
Apparently, Oliver Cromwell
stabled his horses here.

05:40.370 --> 05:42.167
I don't know if that's true.

05:46.042 --> 05:48.190
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:48.215 --> 05:50.010
It's obviously not top
of the cleaning rota.

05:50.035 --> 05:51.065
Oh, thank you.

06:03.346 --> 06:05.665
This isn't the best bit.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.106
Come here. Come on.

06:18.146 --> 06:19.906
You've come this far.

06:25.866 --> 06:28.506
You're going to have to go first
because it's a bit tight in there.

06:29.305 --> 06:31.246
It used to be a broom cupboard.

06:39.546 --> 06:41.065
What am I looking for?

06:41.066 --> 06:43.106
It's on the back of the
door. Can you see it?

06:54.746 --> 06:56.425
The suffragette, you know?

06:56.426 --> 06:59.865
Yeah. Um, I know who she is. Derby Day.

06:59.866 --> 07:02.585
Yeah. She slipped in here on the night

07:02.586 --> 07:05.265
of the census of 1911, I think it was.

07:05.266 --> 07:07.785
It was before she, you know,
jumped in front of the horse,

07:07.786 --> 07:09.675
obviously caused a lot of trouble.

07:10.666 --> 07:13.185
"In this broom cupboard
Emily Wilding Davison

07:13.186 --> 07:15.305
"hid herself illegally

07:15.306 --> 07:17.668
"during the night of the 1911 census.

07:18.546 --> 07:21.625
"In this way she was
able to record her address

07:21.626 --> 07:24.826
"on the night of the census as being...

07:26.239 --> 07:27.679
"the House of Commons."

07:29.879 --> 07:31.599
I knew you'd be interested.

07:51.079 --> 07:52.239
OK?

09:21.477 --> 09:23.759
I've never done anything
like that before.

09:25.976 --> 09:27.416
Then lucky me.

10:36.359 --> 10:37.359
Hey.

10:38.719 --> 10:39.999
Hi.

10:43.729 --> 10:46.398
- Oh, sorry, I forgot to get back...
- It's OK, it's OK.

10:46.399 --> 10:50.278
The girl at the counter
said the own-brand stuff

10:50.279 --> 10:53.078
is exactly the same, unsurprisingly.

10:53.079 --> 10:55.158
You still suffering?

10:55.159 --> 10:56.174
The chilli might help.

10:56.199 --> 10:58.002
Yeah, if I can taste it.

11:04.879 --> 11:06.998
Mm, not bad.

11:06.999 --> 11:10.358
- Did you get a chance to talk to Rosa?
- How did it go?

11:10.359 --> 11:12.320
- The Standing Committee?
- Oh.

11:13.440 --> 11:16.559
Select Committee. Um, fine, yeah.

11:17.676 --> 11:19.236
Rosa wasn't in today.

11:21.125 --> 11:22.205
Shall I set the table?

11:23.599 --> 11:24.999
I've done it.

11:27.572 --> 11:30.278
So, according to Martin,

11:30.279 --> 11:33.159
it's a thing now, so no going back.

11:35.002 --> 11:37.158
- Every birthday?
- Mm.

11:37.159 --> 11:40.159
As if secret sodding Santa
wasn't bad enough.

11:45.120 --> 11:47.507
It's good, love. Tasty.

13:11.019 --> 13:13.089
_

13:13.978 --> 13:17.666
_

13:21.242 --> 13:24.711
'...but the only person I
can talk to about you is you.

13:27.160 --> 13:29.579
'What we did today is without doubt...

13:29.604 --> 13:33.699
_

13:37.044 --> 13:38.644
'I know nothing about you.

13:39.750 --> 13:42.134
_

13:45.051 --> 13:47.442
'Sex with you is like
being eaten by a wolf.

13:52.979 --> 13:55.398
'Will you even give me a second thought,

13:55.399 --> 13:57.679
or is this just something you do?'

14:12.874 --> 14:17.318
FYI, all the candidates
and the specs we put up.

14:17.319 --> 14:19.158
Saves you printing out the e-mails.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.798
You're a star. Thank you.

14:21.799 --> 14:26.518
Um, Liz, about Kat's maternity cover...

14:26.519 --> 14:28.559
I'm really sorry, I just can't face it.

14:29.604 --> 14:32.496
The thought of doing that commute
again every day makes me

14:32.521 --> 14:34.160
want to bang my head against a wall.

14:34.185 --> 14:35.864
Even for six months?

14:35.889 --> 14:38.794
- It's really why I went part-time.
- It's OK.

14:38.795 --> 14:41.121
Kat practically told us at
the moment of conception.

14:41.146 --> 14:42.434
We'll find someone.

14:55.475 --> 14:57.514
Um, it's black silk

14:57.515 --> 14:59.794
with a red and orange pattern in it.

14:59.795 --> 15:01.590
And when was it you were in, madam?

15:01.615 --> 15:02.794
Tuesday.

15:02.795 --> 15:05.035
Tuesday. One moment, please.

15:12.475 --> 15:15.114
Sorry, madam. No scarves at all.

15:15.115 --> 15:16.341
Oh, well, it was worth a try.

15:16.366 --> 15:17.394
- Indeed.
- Thank you.

15:17.395 --> 15:18.515
You're welcome.

16:10.795 --> 16:12.634
So...

16:12.635 --> 16:15.754
are you sure that you
weren't just hanging out here

16:15.755 --> 16:18.474
on the off-chance that
we'd bump into each other?

16:18.475 --> 16:19.714
Naturally.

16:19.715 --> 16:22.675
No, I... I work at
the Beaufort Institute.

16:23.755 --> 16:26.034
- Oh, classy.
- You've heard of it?

16:26.035 --> 16:27.234
Well, yeah, of course.

16:27.235 --> 16:29.394
It crops up in the news
all the time, doesn't it?

16:29.395 --> 16:33.081
Whenever there's something
about genes or genomes or DNA,

16:33.106 --> 16:36.354
which, thanks to you, I now
know aren't all the same thing.

16:38.995 --> 16:40.395
Sorry.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.234
What is it you do exactly?

16:50.235 --> 16:52.634
Well, you know, it's civil service.

16:52.635 --> 16:54.220
All very boring.

16:57.555 --> 17:00.154
You don't look like a civil servant.

17:00.155 --> 17:02.155
You don't look like a scientist.

17:09.035 --> 17:10.435
You're married.

17:12.836 --> 17:13.955
So am I.

17:16.637 --> 17:18.434
Shall we just skip all that?

17:18.435 --> 17:20.915
I assume neither of us is
looking for a parachute.

17:22.635 --> 17:23.755
No.

17:24.814 --> 17:25.994
Absolutely not.

17:28.075 --> 17:29.155
Great.

17:37.835 --> 17:40.434
I would love it if my daughter
wanted to be a scientist,

17:40.435 --> 17:44.594
it's just that, at the moment, that
would depend on lab coats coming

17:44.595 --> 17:49.114
in totally artificial fibre, being
really shiny, and preferably pink.

17:50.635 --> 17:53.674
Carrie, my daughter, was
always completely set on it.

17:53.675 --> 17:55.514
Tunnel vision like me, I suppose.

18:00.435 --> 18:02.834
My niece is doing triple science

18:02.835 --> 18:05.315
at A level. Maybe you
could give her a pep talk?

18:10.075 --> 18:11.554
Um...

18:11.555 --> 18:13.754
isn't this all a bit...

18:13.755 --> 18:16.801
back to front, maybe, don't you think?

18:21.555 --> 18:24.474
Shoot first, ask questions later.

18:48.715 --> 18:49.875
Yvonne!

18:51.835 --> 18:53.595
Come on, drink.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.155
So how's Gary?

18:58.835 --> 19:01.563
Me first. How are things
with you and Chris?

19:02.595 --> 19:04.234
Oh...

19:04.235 --> 19:05.714
"Oh"?

19:05.715 --> 19:07.434
It's nothing to worry about.

19:07.435 --> 19:10.354
It's... just... you know,

19:10.355 --> 19:12.634
he's stopped making
as much of an effort,

19:12.635 --> 19:15.994
we're not tearing each
other's clothes off anymore.

19:15.995 --> 19:18.114
That's not sounding good, Suze.

19:18.115 --> 19:20.274
It's fine.

19:20.275 --> 19:23.395
It's very... civilised.

19:27.439 --> 19:30.634
Anyway, I thought you'd be pleased...

19:30.635 --> 19:32.354
Captain Sensible.

19:32.355 --> 19:35.074
Oh, God, is that what I am?

19:35.075 --> 19:36.794
Always.

19:41.909 --> 19:44.274
Is everything OK?

19:44.275 --> 19:45.659
How is Gary?

19:48.355 --> 19:50.194
Yeah, he's fine. Um...

19:50.195 --> 19:51.435
sends his love.

19:53.728 --> 19:57.154
- You know, it's not that girl, is it?
- Rosa?

19:57.155 --> 20:00.115
I told him to talk to the dean
to make sure it was official.

20:01.635 --> 20:03.034
I know it's all in her head,

20:03.035 --> 20:05.275
but you need backup these days.

20:06.315 --> 20:07.773
You're sure it was, then?

20:08.635 --> 20:12.474
No, it's just Gary's
still an attractive man.

20:12.475 --> 20:14.274
I know you two are rock solid...

20:14.275 --> 20:16.257
Hey, always his greatest fan.

20:19.360 --> 20:21.354
No, I think we're out
of the woods on that one.

20:21.355 --> 20:23.266
20 years ago, maybe.

20:23.291 --> 20:26.371
The students were queueing up,
he used to get so embarrassed.

20:32.035 --> 20:33.155
"Still attractive".

20:34.982 --> 20:36.702
Do you think that's
what they say about us?

20:37.750 --> 20:40.284
What is going on with you?

20:43.075 --> 20:44.515
You're very twitchy.

20:50.315 --> 20:51.715
Must be my age.

20:54.561 --> 20:56.994
Why was that...? Why's that funny?

20:56.995 --> 20:59.234
It's like, what age are you, 100?

20:59.235 --> 21:01.355
Let's change the subject
now. I'm getting you drunk.

21:03.024 --> 21:04.859
Oh... go for it.

21:12.155 --> 21:14.194
Hi, erm,

21:14.195 --> 21:15.275
I think...

21:16.745 --> 21:18.154
Let's not.

21:18.155 --> 21:21.875
I mean, it was really, really...

21:23.018 --> 21:26.994
...what it was, but too
many people can get hurt.

21:26.995 --> 21:29.119
Oh, God, the cliches, but it's true.

21:29.565 --> 21:31.822
So...

21:31.847 --> 21:33.086
that's it.

21:33.111 --> 21:34.350
Yeah.

21:34.375 --> 21:35.877
Take care.

22:14.155 --> 22:15.915
No!

22:23.395 --> 22:24.755
Ah, fuck!

22:25.993 --> 22:27.120
Shit!

22:28.035 --> 22:29.714
Bloody hell!

22:29.715 --> 22:31.154
Has she cut herself?

22:31.155 --> 22:32.594
It's Rosa.

22:32.595 --> 22:33.715
What?!

22:34.755 --> 22:35.891
- Sorry.
- Come on, Rosa.

22:35.916 --> 22:37.514
What the hell are you doing?

22:37.515 --> 22:39.114
Careful, careful!

22:39.115 --> 22:41.474
No! Leave the bloody bottles!

22:41.475 --> 22:42.834
Oh, God.

22:42.835 --> 22:45.594
Sorry, I'm... I'm a bit... bit pissed.

22:45.595 --> 22:49.234
- Clearly.
- I just...

22:49.235 --> 22:51.554
My friend, Mel, she
lives just down the road.

22:51.555 --> 22:54.714
She was having a crisis, a
thing, and I just thought...

22:54.715 --> 22:56.514
You know, it's the...

22:56.515 --> 22:58.354
it's your road.

22:58.355 --> 22:59.300
I'm sorry.

22:59.325 --> 23:00.871
- It's all right.
- Sorry.

23:00.896 --> 23:03.114
Oh, Jeez! What have
you done to yourself?

23:03.115 --> 23:05.754
Keep it up, keep it up. Come on.

23:05.755 --> 23:07.274
There we are.

23:07.275 --> 23:08.715
Straight through.

23:16.835 --> 23:18.314
I think she needs stitches.

23:18.315 --> 23:19.474
Thank you.

23:19.475 --> 23:20.755
I'll get it looked at.

23:22.475 --> 23:23.635
Come on.

23:26.515 --> 23:27.715
I'm sorry.

23:30.755 --> 23:32.075
Mind your head.

24:14.835 --> 24:16.035
Hello, come in!

24:17.075 --> 24:18.194
Mum!

24:18.195 --> 24:19.435
All right?

24:22.235 --> 24:24.834
- How are you doing?
- I'm good. How are you?

24:24.835 --> 24:27.074
These are lovely, Carrie, thank you.

24:27.075 --> 24:30.114
Poor Dad! Does he ever
have to work on a Saturday?

24:30.115 --> 24:31.274
He won't be much longer.

24:31.275 --> 24:33.874
I think it was just some papers
that he forgot to bring back.

24:33.875 --> 24:35.274
Can I borrow these?

24:35.275 --> 24:36.834
Yeah, sure.

24:36.835 --> 24:38.234
Yes, please. Thanks.

24:38.235 --> 24:39.474
Carrie, love, do you want some?

24:39.475 --> 24:41.046
Or there's white in the
fridge if you'd prefer?

24:41.070 --> 24:42.350
Oh, no thanks.

24:43.889 --> 24:46.702
Have you spoken to Adam at all?

24:46.727 --> 24:47.727
Mm-mm.

24:48.248 --> 24:50.914
Not recently, though Dad's been
in touch on Facebook though.

24:50.915 --> 24:51.994
Hey!

24:51.995 --> 24:53.195
Here he is!

24:54.635 --> 24:56.514
Bloody hell, A&E!

24:56.515 --> 24:58.194
I'm not doing that again in a hurry.

24:58.195 --> 25:00.970
- A&E? What's wrong?
- Hey!

25:00.995 --> 25:02.154
Didn't Mum say?

25:02.155 --> 25:03.434
Hi, Sathnam.

25:03.435 --> 25:06.714
This research assistant turned up
on our doorstep in the middle of

25:06.715 --> 25:11.554
the night and managed to cut
herself on a broken bottle.

25:11.555 --> 25:13.315
Mum said you were at the office.

25:15.555 --> 25:18.714
Well, what was she doing pitching
up here in the middle of the night?

25:18.715 --> 25:20.914
God knows! She was pissed, I think.

25:20.915 --> 25:22.514
Did she need stitches?

25:22.515 --> 25:23.875
A couple. All fine.

25:29.275 --> 25:30.754
Nobody died!

25:30.755 --> 25:32.914
Look at this! Smashing.

25:32.915 --> 25:34.114
Smells good as well, love.

25:34.115 --> 25:36.315
Let's get some of it through
to the table, shall we?

25:39.635 --> 25:42.394
- So, news.
- Hmm?

25:42.395 --> 25:43.875
Is it the Aberystwyth job?

25:45.334 --> 25:46.534
I'm pregnant.

25:50.195 --> 25:53.274
Oh, my God... pregnant. Pregnant!

25:53.275 --> 25:55.314
I know, it's mad!

25:55.315 --> 25:57.354
I should have told you when I came in.

25:57.355 --> 25:59.194
That's wonderful, well done.

25:59.195 --> 26:00.435
Oh, Mum!

26:09.995 --> 26:13.114
I'm five years older than
you were when you had me.

26:13.115 --> 26:15.354
Yeah, and I've never
pretended that that was ideal.

26:15.355 --> 26:17.314
Yes, you did! You said it was great.

26:17.315 --> 26:19.554
"Got it all out of the way and
was back on the career ladder

26:19.555 --> 26:22.354
before the rest of them were even
thinking of popping out a sprog."

26:22.355 --> 26:25.994
I'm just saying that your
work is going so well.

26:25.995 --> 26:29.274
And it'll go just as well when
I'm back from maternity leave.

26:29.275 --> 26:32.794
Honestly, Mum, the
department's fine about it.

26:32.795 --> 26:34.434
What if you don't want to go back?

26:34.435 --> 26:36.391
Of course I'll want to. You did.

26:38.395 --> 26:42.035
You know, it took me eight
years to finish my PhD.

26:43.322 --> 26:44.815
And your dad did it in three.

26:45.846 --> 26:49.034
And your Nana practically
sang the Hallelujah Chorus

26:49.035 --> 26:51.074
every time he changed a nappy.

26:51.075 --> 26:53.834
She still calls women
who work "career girls".

26:53.835 --> 26:56.714
Yeah. Don't forget "lady doctors".

26:56.715 --> 26:58.555
Well, Nana...

27:00.155 --> 27:02.102
...the world's moved on a bit, hasn't it?

27:03.075 --> 27:04.954
Yeah. Thank God.

27:04.955 --> 27:07.114
Go to the cinema, do all the
things you won't be able to do

27:07.115 --> 27:08.194
in nine months.

27:08.195 --> 27:10.514
- Oh, don't tell him that!
- Love you.

27:10.515 --> 27:12.594
Or ever again! I love you, too.

27:12.595 --> 27:13.715
Thanks for everything.

27:14.271 --> 27:15.994
Keep them as long as you like.

27:15.995 --> 27:17.474
Love you, guys. Thanks for lunch.

27:17.475 --> 27:18.555
Drive safely.

27:24.035 --> 27:26.074
Bloody hell.

27:26.075 --> 27:27.555
Granny and Grandad.

27:37.057 --> 27:39.439
If you're sleeping with her,
you can tell me, you know.

27:42.235 --> 27:43.874
I mean, she seems very vulnerable...

27:43.875 --> 27:45.075
I'm not.

27:51.315 --> 27:52.555
Von.

27:53.995 --> 27:55.035
OK.

28:13.913 --> 28:15.593
There was a possibility of that...

28:17.835 --> 28:19.634
...but I shut it down.

28:19.635 --> 28:21.315
I think that's why she's so upset.

28:25.766 --> 28:27.046
"Possibility".

28:28.635 --> 28:30.715
That day when we got the
grant, back in the summer...

28:32.915 --> 28:35.075
...we were all celebrating...

28:35.950 --> 28:38.314
- ...pissed...
- You said it was all in her head.

28:38.315 --> 28:40.121
Well... largely.

28:44.835 --> 28:47.794
So, what? You snogged her
or was it more than that...?

28:47.795 --> 28:51.314
I'm not going to give you chapter
and verse. We're not bloody teenagers!

28:58.195 --> 28:59.635
Nothing happened.

29:03.016 --> 29:04.416
That's all you need to know.

29:25.195 --> 29:26.315
Shit.

29:59.915 --> 30:01.075
Thank you.

30:07.995 --> 30:12.037
How's the wonderful world
of protein sequencing?

30:13.084 --> 30:14.474
You got it right.

30:14.475 --> 30:15.675
Of course I did.

30:27.026 --> 30:29.784
So, what... what made you
change your mind, then?

30:31.795 --> 30:33.035
About seeing me again?

30:39.195 --> 30:40.954
I suppose you're irresistible.

30:43.035 --> 30:44.035
Clearly.

30:46.820 --> 30:49.220
There's something else going
on with you though, isn't there?

30:59.212 --> 31:00.856
'Tell me something about your work.'

31:02.475 --> 31:05.514
Something surprising
that everybody gets wrong.

31:05.515 --> 31:06.755
Umm...

31:08.755 --> 31:10.354
That we know what we're doing?

31:10.355 --> 31:11.634
Seriously.

31:11.635 --> 31:14.314
There's this image of
science, the clinical thing,

31:14.315 --> 31:17.434
that we're efficient and we
know everything, but, actually,

31:17.435 --> 31:20.994
all we can ever do is hazily
grasp but a fraction of what it is

31:20.995 --> 31:22.634
we're trying to pin down...

31:22.635 --> 31:23.794
like the genome.

31:23.795 --> 31:26.074
Your typical haploid human genome...

31:26.075 --> 31:28.354
Sorry, haploid, what's that again?

31:28.355 --> 31:29.673
Your basic genome.

31:30.875 --> 31:34.315
It has three billion DNA base pairs...

31:35.355 --> 31:39.194
...of which less than
2% code for proteins.

31:39.195 --> 31:42.332
So, the rest of the DNA, 98%,

31:42.357 --> 31:45.477
we don't really know
what it's there for.

31:46.403 --> 31:49.867
Could be useful or could
be just biochemical rubbish.

31:50.715 --> 31:53.754
And what I do? I'm just
scrabbling about in the dirt,

31:53.755 --> 31:55.195
trying to look for the good stuff.

31:56.652 --> 31:58.289
"We'll never conquer space."

31:59.797 --> 32:02.170
It's an Arthur C Clarke thing.

32:02.195 --> 32:05.554
Well, basically, when everyone
was getting all excited over the

32:05.555 --> 32:10.234
moon landings, he said, "Don't
worry, whatever we discover,

32:10.235 --> 32:15.722
"the universe is far too big and too
random for us ever to know it properly."

32:16.374 --> 32:17.774
"We'll never conquer space."

32:27.755 --> 32:29.794
'Life's mysterious,

32:29.795 --> 32:31.115
which is a good thing.'

32:32.566 --> 32:33.846
Isn't it?

32:42.195 --> 32:43.515
What are we doing?

32:46.555 --> 32:47.875
You're beautiful.

33:14.196 --> 33:16.496
Oh, no. You, you were
carrying that, actually.

33:18.595 --> 33:21.634
Well, no, I mean, if
someone happened to see us

33:21.635 --> 33:24.714
coming downstairs together,
they might wonder why

33:24.715 --> 33:26.612
you're dressed differently coming out.

33:28.915 --> 33:30.475
'Am I in over my head with you?'

33:35.715 --> 33:37.874
Remind me what it is you do again?

33:37.875 --> 33:38.994
I told you, didn't I?

33:38.995 --> 33:40.914
Crown Estate.

33:40.915 --> 33:42.063
Oiling the wheels.

33:45.555 --> 33:46.675
'Who are you?

33:48.395 --> 33:49.515
'I couldn't say.

33:51.174 --> 33:53.074
'Although I have noticed

33:53.075 --> 33:54.995
secrets are the air you breathe.'

33:56.795 --> 33:58.315
'I've got you a present.'

33:59.195 --> 34:02.434
You didn't go for the cheapest option.

34:02.435 --> 34:05.258
Well, why would you have
a cheap phone in your bag?

34:06.574 --> 34:09.149
'It just sort of shouts
"affair", doesn't it?'

34:13.155 --> 34:14.793
'It's a pay-as-you-go.

34:14.795 --> 34:17.274
'Obviously, you don't link
it to your e-mail account.

34:17.275 --> 34:19.514
'Oh, and don't top it up at
the same place twice, right,

34:19.514 --> 34:22.313
cos it's important not
to establish a pattern,

34:22.315 --> 34:24.696
which is kind of the exact
opposite of what you do.

34:30.864 --> 34:32.274
If we're going to do this,

34:32.275 --> 34:34.685
then at least we can make
sure no-one gets hurt.'

34:43.686 --> 34:45.154
You look well.

34:45.155 --> 34:46.234
- Do I?
- Mmm.

34:46.235 --> 34:47.395
Thanks.

34:48.991 --> 34:50.514
Here you go.

34:50.514 --> 34:52.577
Oh, I'm fine, George, thanks.

34:53.395 --> 34:54.914
Thought you'd both be latte girls.

34:54.915 --> 34:56.234
Am I right?

34:56.235 --> 34:57.714
Well, that was the button I pressed.

34:57.715 --> 34:59.594
It probably all tastes the same.

34:59.595 --> 35:02.194
Sorry, Yvonne. I know
you like posh coffee.

35:02.195 --> 35:04.114
Oh, as long as it's caffeine.

35:04.115 --> 35:06.914
I like to pretend I'm
classy, but I'm really easy.

35:12.635 --> 35:16.674
So, I'm here to talk to you about
why genome editing should have

35:16.675 --> 35:19.394
transformed the way we treat cancer.

35:19.395 --> 35:20.514
What is genome editing?

35:20.515 --> 35:22.480
I don't think I need to explain
that to this room, but if you'll

35:22.504 --> 35:24.143
- _
- bear with me for one moment.

35:24.168 --> 35:25.914
DNA.

35:25.915 --> 35:28.395
Inserted, replaced, deleted.

35:29.835 --> 35:32.754
Anyway Liz slices it, these
things are always a slog.

35:32.755 --> 35:34.034
You getting the Tube?

35:34.035 --> 35:36.034
Er, no, I've got things to do.

35:36.035 --> 35:38.114
Oh, I'll see you tomorrow then...

35:38.115 --> 35:39.434
When fates are decided.

35:39.435 --> 35:41.315
- Yeah. Bye, George.
- See ya.

35:57.224 --> 35:58.664
I've been stalking you.

36:02.367 --> 36:04.194
RMU,

36:04.195 --> 36:07.594
the PhD with merchant
supervising, the Beaufort...

36:07.595 --> 36:09.314
It's my dream career.

36:09.315 --> 36:11.475
Well, we enjoyed hearing
your presentation.

36:13.835 --> 36:17.234
Hang on. Dr Carmichael,

36:17.235 --> 36:20.474
whatever the outcome, and
I do totally respect that.

36:20.475 --> 36:24.634
I'd... I'd really appreciate
the opportunity

36:24.635 --> 36:27.339
to talk with you about your research.

36:34.275 --> 36:35.515
I'm very discreet.

36:42.402 --> 36:43.675
Were you tempted?

36:45.315 --> 36:46.912
Would I be telling you if I was?

36:50.155 --> 36:51.274
Tin.

36:51.275 --> 36:52.554
Recycling.

36:52.555 --> 36:54.314
He made my skin crawl, actually.

36:54.315 --> 36:56.234
Confident little creep.

36:56.235 --> 36:59.331
Lots of, you know,
primate crotch display.

37:00.155 --> 37:02.834
Well, you're the one
with all the power, love,

37:02.835 --> 37:05.034
that's probably what it was about.

37:05.035 --> 37:09.714
You can screw him over, so he
thought he'd do the same with you.

37:09.715 --> 37:11.314
You know, redress the balance.

37:11.315 --> 37:12.674
Well, he's not getting the job.

37:12.675 --> 37:14.914
His presentation was
extremely pedestrian.

37:14.915 --> 37:16.155
Oh, you see? You won.

37:18.515 --> 37:20.914
Adam came by today.

37:20.915 --> 37:22.714
- Adam?
- Yeah, around lunchtime.

37:22.715 --> 37:24.074
I was lucky not to miss him.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.314
Well, why didn't you say?

37:25.315 --> 37:27.114
It was a flying visit.

37:27.115 --> 37:29.754
He's down for a friend's gig, he
said. Picked up a piece of kit.

37:29.755 --> 37:31.314
A loop pedal or...

37:31.315 --> 37:32.714
I've probably got that wrong.

37:32.715 --> 37:34.155
- Well, how was he?
- Fine.

37:34.897 --> 37:36.257
Did he look well?

37:37.512 --> 37:38.591
Ish.

37:38.616 --> 37:40.914
He's looked worse. Love, he was fine.

37:40.915 --> 37:42.354
You know what he's like.

37:42.355 --> 37:44.655
He stayed for a cup of tea and
the contents of the biscuit tin.

37:44.679 --> 37:46.718
Did he say how long he
was going to be around?

37:46.743 --> 37:49.223
Just for the gig, I think, then
he's back off up to Manchester.

37:50.355 --> 37:51.435
He sends his love.

37:52.621 --> 37:53.889
Said to give you a big kiss.

38:29.287 --> 38:31.554
'Has anyone seen you using the phone?'

38:31.555 --> 38:33.034
Well, no-one I know, obviously.

38:33.035 --> 38:34.914
'What will you tell your
husband, if he finds it,

38:34.915 --> 38:36.194
if he goes through your bag?'

38:36.195 --> 38:38.114
He won't.

38:38.115 --> 38:40.354
We're not like that.
He's not the jealous type.

38:40.355 --> 38:42.954
It's important to imagine
the worst-case scenario.

38:42.955 --> 38:45.114
'Well, I'll say that it
belongs to Liz from work'

38:45.115 --> 38:48.234
and that she left it at a meeting
and I've been carrying it around,

38:48.235 --> 38:49.554
intending to give it back.

38:49.555 --> 38:51.794
- Ooh, you're good.
- 'I know.'

38:51.795 --> 38:53.114
It's worrying, isn't it?

38:53.115 --> 38:54.194
'It is a bit.'

38:54.195 --> 38:56.234
But he won't ask or notice.

38:56.235 --> 38:59.314
Tell me something that
winds you up about him.

38:59.315 --> 39:00.435
What?

39:00.460 --> 39:03.114
'Your husband. Something that
really gets on your nerves.'

39:03.115 --> 39:04.274
No.

39:04.275 --> 39:05.474
'Go on.'

39:05.475 --> 39:07.114
No! I'm not doing that.

39:07.115 --> 39:08.834
No parachutes, do you remember?

39:08.835 --> 39:10.075
I'm going.

39:31.017 --> 39:33.728
_

39:37.275 --> 39:38.634
Hey.

39:38.635 --> 39:39.715
Oh, hi.

39:44.435 --> 39:46.398
'I can't plead biology.

39:47.835 --> 39:50.754
Sex may be an animal pleasure,

39:50.755 --> 39:53.395
but adultery, I'm
discovering, is a human one.'

39:55.575 --> 39:58.354
"Is life a boon?

39:58.355 --> 40:02.474
If so, it must befall that death,

40:02.475 --> 40:04.834
whene'er he call,

40:04.835 --> 40:06.462
must call too soon."

40:10.055 --> 40:12.794
'It's not exactly win-win, is it?'

40:12.795 --> 40:16.770
Life is a boon and then you die.

40:16.795 --> 40:18.354
Or life isn't a boon,

40:18.355 --> 40:20.643
it's just shit, and then you die.

40:22.564 --> 40:23.954
'What do you reckon?'

40:23.955 --> 40:25.315
'Me?

40:26.875 --> 40:28.035
I reckon life's a boon.'

40:55.139 --> 40:57.270
It's all right, it's all
right. Risk assessment.

40:58.091 --> 40:59.998
Camera...

41:00.023 --> 41:01.223
Facing the wrong way.

41:19.835 --> 41:21.115
Excuse me, have you got a light?

41:22.905 --> 41:24.741
I didn't know you smoked.

41:24.766 --> 41:26.115
I don't.

41:27.766 --> 41:29.022
It's handy sometimes.

41:38.155 --> 41:40.994
Er, I'm sorry. I miscalculated.

41:40.995 --> 41:42.355
Bit near rush hour.

41:51.389 --> 41:53.799
It's really a thing with
you, isn't it, public places?

41:55.555 --> 41:58.395
Well, you know me well
enough by now. It's...

41:59.995 --> 42:02.554
I can't help it. It
turns me on, it just does.

42:02.555 --> 42:03.754
It's probably...

42:03.755 --> 42:04.954
It's probably genetic.

42:04.955 --> 42:07.674
Christ, do you really
think that means something?

42:07.675 --> 42:10.725
That that absolves you of all
responsibility, just hard-wiring?

42:14.235 --> 42:15.554
But...

42:15.555 --> 42:16.834
Well...

42:16.835 --> 42:19.994
OK, probably that was a
bad choice of words, but...

42:19.995 --> 42:21.514
I'm sorry, this is ridiculous.

42:21.515 --> 42:23.874
At our age. What kind of stupid
game are we playing, anyway?

42:23.875 --> 42:25.532
Hey! What?

42:25.557 --> 42:27.194
Wait, wait, wait.

42:27.195 --> 42:29.155
I thought... I thought...
I thought you did, too.

42:32.555 --> 42:33.755
No.

42:35.475 --> 42:36.755
It's you, actually.

42:37.995 --> 42:39.634
You turn me on.

42:44.915 --> 42:46.874
It's all right. I know the deal.

42:46.875 --> 42:49.834
I might be stupid, but I'm
not blind. Those girls earlier,

42:49.835 --> 42:52.354
I'm sure you'd rather be screwing
them, preferably outside,

42:52.355 --> 42:53.649
but you've got to settle for
what's on offer.

42:53.673 --> 42:55.034
Oh, my God!

42:55.035 --> 42:56.755
- Well, look at me!
- What? What?

42:58.887 --> 43:00.183
You're gorgeous!

43:01.198 --> 43:03.628
I'm middle-aged and my body looks...

43:05.915 --> 43:07.715
I look like a bloody jelly baby!

43:08.629 --> 43:09.869
Yvonne!

44:33.355 --> 44:34.675
Hello?

44:36.795 --> 44:38.434
Hello?

44:40.580 --> 44:42.500
- Adam?
- No. It's no-one.

45:00.119 --> 45:03.874
'Gary's friend, Michael, he
started base jumping in his forties,

45:03.875 --> 45:05.635
flinging himself off cliffs.

45:09.332 --> 45:10.852
At least you don't do that.

45:15.995 --> 45:17.555
You just ask other people to.'

45:24.155 --> 45:27.514
Von, I'm taking the
charger from the kitchen.

45:27.515 --> 45:28.995
That's mine.

45:32.595 --> 45:33.994
You look nice.

45:33.995 --> 45:36.274
Yeah, it's Jonathon's leaving do.

45:36.275 --> 45:37.994
I'll be making your apologies.

45:37.995 --> 45:41.314
Oh, course. That's tonight, is it?

45:41.315 --> 45:43.012
They'll have a charger at the hotel.

45:43.037 --> 45:45.514
Och, I told them not to
bother with the hotel,

45:45.515 --> 45:47.994
I'm... I'm kipping at Andy's.

45:47.995 --> 45:49.274
Uh, right, OK.

45:49.275 --> 45:51.714
Well, have a nice
night. Love to Jonathon.

45:51.715 --> 45:52.795
See you Friday.

46:24.035 --> 46:25.714
I...

46:25.715 --> 46:27.634
Thank you very much.

46:27.635 --> 46:28.954
Cheers.

46:28.955 --> 46:30.074
Thanks.

46:30.075 --> 46:32.754
I-I was just...

46:32.755 --> 46:36.954
I was just imagining
something shorter, that's all.

46:36.955 --> 46:39.554
Well, the rules are tits or legs,

46:39.555 --> 46:41.289
but you can't have both.

46:54.353 --> 46:56.136
Take your knickers off.

47:00.795 --> 47:02.195
Who says I'm wearing any?

47:05.115 --> 47:07.824
Oh, God, I love men.

47:08.475 --> 47:10.480
Of course I am. A dress like this?

47:12.363 --> 47:14.794
So... take...

47:14.795 --> 47:16.435
Take them off now, then.

47:17.715 --> 47:20.434
Come on. I mean, there's got
to be something in it for me,

47:20.435 --> 47:21.875
you're going to this party.

47:28.755 --> 47:30.595
We could have had a night in a hotel.

47:32.707 --> 47:34.147
Gary's away.

47:35.597 --> 47:37.037
I know, you can't.

47:40.995 --> 47:42.715
I love hotels.

47:45.875 --> 47:47.275
Gary hates them.

47:49.995 --> 47:51.634
I'm sorry.

47:51.659 --> 47:52.966
Don't.

47:59.075 --> 48:00.395
So?

48:09.281 --> 48:12.075
I'll take mine... I'll take
mine off, too, if you like.

48:13.235 --> 48:16.595
All right. But you have to put
them back on over your trousers.

48:30.555 --> 48:31.995
Jesus Christ.

48:52.492 --> 48:55.274
Don't talk to any strange men.

48:55.275 --> 48:56.874
Well, it's a science faculty,

48:56.875 --> 48:59.570
so it's going to be
wall-to-wall strange men...

49:01.395 --> 49:03.834
...and there'll be masses of drink.

49:03.835 --> 49:05.234
OK.

49:05.235 --> 49:06.795
So text me later.

49:14.235 --> 49:16.355
Even if you're pissed.

49:23.035 --> 49:24.595
Especially if you're pissed.

49:37.675 --> 49:38.980
Risk assessment.

49:55.715 --> 49:57.474
- Hey...
- It's fine.

49:57.499 --> 49:58.873
How do you know?

49:58.898 --> 50:00.138
Intuition.

50:08.932 --> 50:12.971
By which I mean, of course,
a combination of observation...

50:14.875 --> 50:17.596
...knowledge and experience...

50:18.715 --> 50:21.354
...otherwise known as...

50:21.355 --> 50:23.395
gambler's edge.

50:26.675 --> 50:27.995
Oh, good God.

50:29.195 --> 50:30.954
I can't.

50:30.955 --> 50:32.834
- Oh, yeah, you can.
- I-I really can't.

50:32.835 --> 50:34.515
No, you can. You really can.

51:09.549 --> 51:12.530
_

51:12.555 --> 51:13.955
Hey.

51:16.277 --> 51:17.637
Where's the apple tree?

51:20.475 --> 51:21.635
Long gone.

51:25.518 --> 51:26.755
What time is it?

51:27.845 --> 51:31.674
- It's ten past nine. Shit.
- Go. Go, go on.

51:31.675 --> 51:33.515
Text me, OK? Send me a picture.

51:38.835 --> 51:40.555
- Hey!
- What?

51:48.835 --> 51:50.674
It's a dummy camera.

51:50.675 --> 51:51.754
How do you know?

51:51.755 --> 51:53.474
It's not hooked up to anything.

51:53.499 --> 51:57.770
They just put them up as a
deterrent, that's all. Seriously.

51:57.795 --> 52:00.514
It's easy to tell the difference
if you know what to look for.

52:00.515 --> 52:01.595
Have fun.

52:04.595 --> 52:06.874
Oh, my God.

52:06.875 --> 52:08.566
I'm fucking a spook.

52:46.809 --> 52:49.048
- Great. Thank you.
- God, you look gorgeous.

52:49.073 --> 52:50.005
- Thank you.
- Hiya.

52:50.030 --> 52:50.954
George, how are you?

52:50.955 --> 52:52.624
- Good. Cheers.
- Cheers.

52:53.435 --> 52:55.594
- Proper champagne.
- Mm.

52:55.595 --> 52:57.994
Is Jonathon really paying
for all this himself?

52:57.995 --> 52:59.874
Well, maybe he got one of the patrons

52:59.875 --> 53:02.354
to put their hand in their
pocket. Peller or someone.

53:02.355 --> 53:05.154
- Doesn't that count as a bribe?
- Well, not if he's retiring.

53:05.155 --> 53:06.714
- Jonathon.
- Hey, George, hello!

53:06.715 --> 53:08.434
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

53:08.435 --> 53:10.914
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

53:10.915 --> 53:13.354
Nice to see you. How are you?

53:13.355 --> 53:16.114
It's exactly like Gary to miss a party.

53:16.115 --> 53:17.874
Well, anyway, he's in Sunderland.

53:17.875 --> 53:19.554
Isn't Sunderland where
they have that...?

53:19.555 --> 53:21.929
Yep. Amazing mouse lab.
Gary raves about it.

53:22.795 --> 53:24.274
Do send him my love, won't you?

53:24.275 --> 53:25.915
- Haven't seen him for yonks.
- Mm.

53:34.019 --> 53:36.155
You're fucking a spook.

53:51.228 --> 53:55.620
_

53:59.723 --> 54:03.187
_

54:04.955 --> 54:06.514
Signs are...

54:06.515 --> 54:08.634
they're about to run out.

54:08.635 --> 54:10.674
Better make hay while the sun shines.

54:10.675 --> 54:11.955
Absolutely.

54:14.635 --> 54:16.714
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

54:20.712 --> 54:24.024
_

54:33.035 --> 54:34.874
I've got it.

54:34.875 --> 54:36.874
Oh, dear

54:36.875 --> 54:38.414
I'll look after it.

54:43.475 --> 54:47.221
_

54:58.835 --> 55:00.474
Oh, I'm for my bed.

55:00.475 --> 55:02.114
Total lightweight these days.

55:02.115 --> 55:04.234
Yeah, me, too.

55:04.235 --> 55:06.034
- Sleep well, babe.
- You, too.

55:06.035 --> 55:08.074
- See you on Monday.
- Monday!

55:16.776 --> 55:19.130
_

55:19.155 --> 55:20.594
Do you fancy splitting a cab?

55:20.595 --> 55:21.994
Oh, that's a great idea.

55:21.995 --> 55:23.514
You live west, don't you?

55:23.515 --> 55:24.754
I do, I do, I do.

55:24.755 --> 55:27.074
I just left my stuff in my
office. Won't take me a sec.

55:27.075 --> 55:28.954
- C'mon, c'mon.
- OK.

55:28.955 --> 55:30.235
OK.

55:40.075 --> 55:42.914
Do you know what really
winds me up about Gary?

55:42.915 --> 55:44.594
His haircut. I hate his haircut.

55:44.595 --> 55:47.594
He's had the same haircut for 30 years

55:47.595 --> 55:49.314
and I hated it 30 years ago.

55:49.315 --> 55:51.634
Oh, dearie me.

55:51.635 --> 55:54.594
Oh, God, did I say that
out loud? I'm really sorry.

55:54.595 --> 55:57.985
It is definitely,
definitely time for bed.

56:05.527 --> 56:07.994
Oh, come on, George, don't be silly.

56:07.995 --> 56:09.514
No, no... No, no, no...

56:09.515 --> 56:11.914
Does your husband know
you're fucking someone else?

56:11.915 --> 56:13.434
What?

56:13.435 --> 56:15.194
Does he?

56:15.195 --> 56:17.194
- No, get off.
- Shush, shush, shush.

56:17.195 --> 56:18.795
Get off me!

56:27.995 --> 56:29.515
Come on!

56:30.843 --> 56:32.354
Listen to me.

56:32.355 --> 56:33.954
Now, you move,

56:33.955 --> 56:35.634
even a tiny bit,

56:35.635 --> 56:37.994
and I'll hit you again.

56:37.995 --> 56:39.994
Do you understand me? Do you?

56:39.995 --> 56:41.274
Yeah?

56:41.275 --> 56:43.785
Good girl. Fucking good girl.

56:54.115 --> 56:55.115
Please!

56:58.275 --> 57:00.434
'Fear...

57:00.435 --> 57:02.555
that's what makes animals of us all.'

57:05.355 --> 57:06.955
Before I met you...

57:09.115 --> 57:10.715
...I was civilised.

57:12.757 --> 57:14.016
Civilised.

57:16.955 --> 57:18.695
So help me God.
