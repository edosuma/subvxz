♪♪

00:13.722 --> 00:15.599
(alarm ringing)

00:19.854 --> 00:21.062
Hey. How did it go?

00:21.647 --> 00:23.732
Oh, man,

00:21.647 --> 00:23.732
it was insane.

00:23.774 --> 00:24.775
It was nuts.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.361
Well, tell me.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.361
What happened?

00:27.736 --> 00:30.865
Okay. The news helicopter was

00:27.736 --> 00:30.865
flying around over Swellview,

00:30.906 --> 00:31.991
just going in circles.

00:32.741 --> 00:35.160
Because the helicopter pilot

00:32.741 --> 00:35.160
fell asleep at the controls.

00:35.577 --> 00:37.412
And did you guys figure out

00:35.577 --> 00:37.412
a way to wake him up?

00:37.997 --> 00:38.789
No.

00:39.456 --> 00:40.833
We just watched the helicopter

00:39.456 --> 00:40.833
fly around in circles.

00:41.542 --> 00:44.503
Until it ran out of gas and fell

00:41.542 --> 00:44.503
right down into the Jandy River.

00:46.045 --> 00:47.381
And you guys

00:46.045 --> 00:47.381
didn't do anything?

00:48.256 --> 00:49.508
I got video of it

00:48.256 --> 00:49.508
going down.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.304
What about the pilot?

00:52.177 --> 00:54.304
Was he hurt?

00:54.346 --> 00:55.430
No. Just wet.

00:57.098 --> 00:58.350
So very wet.

00:58.851 --> 01:00.227
(text message alert)

01:01.353 --> 01:03.271
Ugh. Another text

01:01.353 --> 01:03.271
from Jasper.

01:03.313 --> 01:04.982
That's 11 texts

01:03.313 --> 01:04.982
in the last hour.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.025
I got nine.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.403
Man, what's up

01:07.401 --> 01:09.403
with that Jasper kid?

01:09.653 --> 01:11.154
Doesn't he have

01:09.653 --> 01:11.154
any other friends?

01:11.613 --> 01:15.701
Well, yeah, but not the kind

01:11.613 --> 01:15.701
you'd be, you know, proud of.

01:16.702 --> 01:17.953
We're his best friends.

01:18.453 --> 01:20.288
But now because

01:18.453 --> 01:20.288
we work for you,

01:20.330 --> 01:22.332
we end up having to

01:20.330 --> 01:22.332
leave him alone all the time.

01:22.708 --> 01:24.125
I feel really bad

01:22.708 --> 01:24.125
for him.

01:25.460 --> 01:26.253
Yeah.

01:27.588 --> 01:28.589
You guys hungry?

01:29.214 --> 01:30.049
Who wants Greek food?

01:31.884 --> 01:34.386
Ray, we just told you

01:31.884 --> 01:34.386
about a real problem

01:34.428 --> 01:35.930
we have with our friend.

01:35.971 --> 01:37.681
And all you can say

01:35.971 --> 01:37.681
is "Who wants Greek food?"

01:44.730 --> 01:47.733
- Mmmm...

01:47.775 --> 01:50.193
Man,

01:47.775 --> 01:50.193
I love these "jye-rose."

01:50.527 --> 01:52.320
That's how you say it,

01:50.527 --> 01:52.320
you know, "jye-Rose."

01:54.740 --> 01:55.532
You try.

01:56.199 --> 01:57.659
(both)

01:56.199 --> 01:57.659
Jye-Rose.

01:57.701 --> 01:58.994
Perfect.

01:59.745 --> 02:01.538
Hey, so back to our problem

01:59.745 --> 02:01.538
with Jasper.

02:01.789 --> 02:02.539
(groans)

02:03.373 --> 02:05.125
Don't groan.

02:03.373 --> 02:05.125
He's our friend.

02:05.166 --> 02:07.502
Yeah, and it's not cool

02:05.166 --> 02:07.502
how we always have to lie to him

02:07.544 --> 02:09.838
and leave him all alone

02:07.544 --> 02:09.838
when you need us at work.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.257
Okay. Here's an idea.

02:12.299 --> 02:13.050
What?

02:12.299 --> 02:13.050
What you got?

02:13.842 --> 02:15.928
One night soon,

02:13.842 --> 02:15.928
we go to Jasper's house...

02:15.970 --> 02:16.804
Mm-hmm.

02:16.845 --> 02:17.596
We sneak into

02:16.845 --> 02:17.596
his room...

02:17.721 --> 02:18.472
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

02:19.056 --> 02:20.307
And we brain wipe

02:19.056 --> 02:20.307
his memory

02:20.348 --> 02:21.558
so he doesn't remember

02:20.348 --> 02:21.558
either one of you.

02:21.850 --> 02:22.643
What?

02:21.850 --> 02:22.643
No.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.562
Friends don't

02:23.811 --> 02:25.562
wipe friends' brains.

02:26.354 --> 02:27.731
Yeah, yeah.

02:26.354 --> 02:27.731
Pass the lamb balls.

02:28.440 --> 02:29.524
Fine.

02:29.775 --> 02:30.484
Poor lamb.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.612
Anyway,

02:32.152 --> 02:33.612
I got a better idea.

02:33.654 --> 02:34.446
What?

02:35.363 --> 02:37.866
I say that we just tell Jasper

02:35.363 --> 02:37.866
that I'm Kid Danger.

02:42.037 --> 02:43.080
That was charming.

02:44.456 --> 02:45.373
No!

02:45.791 --> 02:47.918
No, no, no, no.

02:45.791 --> 02:47.918
No, sir.

02:48.418 --> 02:49.670
Oh, why not?

02:49.878 --> 02:51.130
What's the worst thing

02:49.878 --> 02:51.130
that could happen?

02:52.047 --> 02:54.716
The worst thing is if Jasper

02:52.047 --> 02:54.716
blabs it all over the place,

02:54.758 --> 02:57.260
and then everyone in the world

02:54.758 --> 02:57.260
knows Henry's Kid Danger,

02:57.803 --> 03:00.597
and then bad guys follow him

02:57.803 --> 03:00.597
and find out he works here,

03:01.180 --> 03:03.100
so then they know

03:01.180 --> 03:03.100
how to find both of us,

03:03.142 --> 03:05.060
so then they could just

03:03.142 --> 03:05.060
blow up this whole place,

03:05.310 --> 03:07.688
and then they could also figure

03:05.310 --> 03:07.688
out where Henry's house is,

03:07.729 --> 03:10.482
which puts him and his whole

03:07.729 --> 03:10.482
family in major danger.

03:12.693 --> 03:13.777
Okay, but other than that?

03:16.363 --> 03:18.866
Nobody is going

03:16.363 --> 03:18.866
to tell Jasper

03:18.907 --> 03:21.160
or anyone else

03:18.907 --> 03:21.160
that Henry's Kid Danger.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.871
Come on, what if I promise

03:21.200 --> 03:23.871
you he'll keep the secret?

03:24.121 --> 03:25.330
You can't guarantee that.

03:25.706 --> 03:26.581
(Charlotte)

03:25.706 --> 03:26.581
All right.

03:27.332 --> 03:29.208
Why don't we just

03:27.332 --> 03:29.208
test Jasper and see?

03:29.250 --> 03:30.460
Yes. Good.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.254
What are you guys

03:31.545 --> 03:33.254
talking about?

03:34.255 --> 03:36.550
We'll make up some

03:34.255 --> 03:36.550
big old juicy secret.

03:36.591 --> 03:38.052
Ugh.

03:38.093 --> 03:39.594
And then if he keeps

03:38.093 --> 03:39.594
that secret for a week,

03:39.636 --> 03:41.304
we know we can trust him.

03:41.346 --> 03:42.222
What do you think?

03:43.598 --> 03:44.307
Okay.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.144
But I get to pick

03:45.684 --> 03:47.144
the fake secret.

03:47.978 --> 03:48.603
Sure.

03:48.645 --> 03:49.437
Done deal, man.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.272
Okay then.

03:52.024 --> 03:53.901
So, what secret do you

03:52.024 --> 03:53.901
want us to tell him?

03:54.693 --> 03:56.195
That you and Henry...

03:57.529 --> 03:59.239
are boyfriend

03:57.529 --> 03:59.239
and girlfriend.

04:02.659 --> 04:03.744
(both)

04:02.659 --> 04:03.744
Ewww!

04:04.703 --> 04:05.746
Hey!

04:08.957 --> 04:10.291
It all just

04:08.957 --> 04:10.291
kind of happened.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.293
My dad was

04:10.667 --> 04:12.293
an irresponsible scientist.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.755
I wanted an

04:12.920 --> 04:14.755
afterschool job.

04:15.089 --> 04:17.424
(Captain Man)

04:15.089 --> 04:17.424
And by accident,

04:15.089 --> 04:17.424
he made me indestructible.

04:17.465 --> 04:19.051
Ahhh!

04:19.093 --> 04:20.385
(Henry)

04:19.093 --> 04:20.385
I went to

04:19.093 --> 04:20.385
this crazy store

04:20.969 --> 04:22.846
and met a pretty

04:20.969 --> 04:22.846
interesting guy.

04:22.888 --> 04:24.389
I'm going

04:22.888 --> 04:24.389
to blow your mind.

04:24.723 --> 04:27.017
Now I protect the good

04:24.723 --> 04:27.017
citizens of Swellview.

04:27.350 --> 04:28.351
Who call me...

04:28.393 --> 04:29.603
(Henry)

04:28.393 --> 04:29.603
He turned out to be...

04:29.644 --> 04:30.562
(Captain Man)

04:29.644 --> 04:30.562
You know the name.

04:30.604 --> 04:31.521
Captain Man!

04:31.563 --> 04:32.522
That's right, Henry.

04:33.148 --> 04:35.234
In time, I realized

04:33.148 --> 04:35.234
that being a superhero

04:35.275 --> 04:36.401
is a lot to handle alone.

04:36.651 --> 04:37.903
He wanted some help.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.196
(Captain Man)

04:38.278 --> 04:39.196
I needed a sidekick.

04:39.571 --> 04:41.073
I, Henry Hart...

04:41.115 --> 04:42.741
(Captain Man)

04:41.115 --> 04:42.741
Pledge to never ever

04:41.115 --> 04:42.741
ever tell anyone...

04:42.783 --> 04:44.284
That I'm captain Man's

04:42.783 --> 04:44.284
secret sidekick.

04:44.325 --> 04:45.160
(Captain Man)

04:44.325 --> 04:45.160
It is done.

04:45.410 --> 04:46.453
(Henry)

04:45.410 --> 04:46.453
Now we blow bubbles.

04:46.745 --> 04:47.495
(Captain Man)

04:46.745 --> 04:47.495
And fight crime.

04:47.829 --> 04:48.663
(Henry)

04:47.829 --> 04:48.663
Feels good.

05:03.386 --> 05:04.096
Call it.

05:04.138 --> 05:05.931
Up the tubeee!

05:06.431 --> 05:07.307
Oh, my boot.

05:07.766 --> 05:08.809
(Captain Man)

05:07.766 --> 05:08.809
Ha!

05:15.440 --> 05:19.486
Okay. And you say

05:15.440 --> 05:19.486
this happens every morning?

05:19.527 --> 05:22.156
Yeah. I just walk by

05:19.527 --> 05:22.156
and the dog runs up to me,

05:22.697 --> 05:25.075
barking really loud,

05:22.697 --> 05:25.075
and he tries to bite me.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.786
And how does that

05:26.034 --> 05:27.786
make you feel?

05:29.163 --> 05:31.498
Um... Anxious?

05:29.163 --> 05:31.498
Freaked out?

05:32.040 --> 05:33.750
Sometimes pee

05:32.040 --> 05:33.750
runs down my leg.

05:35.710 --> 05:36.795
All right.

05:37.545 --> 05:38.546
Let's try something.

05:38.588 --> 05:39.506
(Boy)

05:38.588 --> 05:39.506
What?

05:40.132 --> 05:42.634
I'm going to pretend to be you.

05:40.132 --> 05:42.634
You pretend to be the dog.

05:43.177 --> 05:45.262
Now, bark at me

05:43.177 --> 05:45.262
like he barks at you.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.389
Okay. Woof, woof, woof.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.389
Woof, woof, woof.

05:48.932 --> 05:50.809
Bad dog.

05:48.932 --> 05:50.809
Bad dog. Bad dog!

05:50.851 --> 05:52.936
All right, I'm sorry!

05:50.851 --> 05:52.936
I'm sorry!

05:57.524 --> 05:58.942
You spanked me.

05:59.651 --> 06:00.652
That's right.

06:01.069 --> 06:03.947
In life sometimes you got to

06:01.069 --> 06:03.947
just face your fears,

06:03.989 --> 06:05.240
throw them over your lap,

06:05.282 --> 06:07.284
and spank them like

06:05.282 --> 06:07.284
it's your job.

06:09.286 --> 06:10.745
Yeeeah.

06:10.787 --> 06:11.746
Whatever you say.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.876
Good.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.876
I'll need $20.

06:16.335 --> 06:18.837
20? I thought it was going

06:16.335 --> 06:18.837
to be a lot less than 20--

06:19.087 --> 06:20.214
Okay, okay.

06:21.756 --> 06:22.966
Spank you later.

06:23.008 --> 06:24.092
Ah, jeez.

06:27.762 --> 06:30.974
- Piper, are you spanking

06:27.762 --> 06:30.974
your friends for money?

06:33.018 --> 06:34.644
Nah, that kid's

06:33.018 --> 06:34.644
not my friend.

06:35.270 --> 06:36.313
I'm a life coach.

06:38.606 --> 06:39.358
What is a life coach?

06:40.734 --> 06:41.484
(sighs)

06:44.029 --> 06:46.405
When people have problems

06:44.029 --> 06:46.405
in life, they come to me.

06:46.948 --> 06:50.118
I give them good advice.

06:46.948 --> 06:50.118
Then they give me money.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.330
Eh, I don't think

06:51.119 --> 06:53.330
that's a very good idea.

06:54.539 --> 06:55.414
Wow, dad.

06:56.583 --> 06:57.792
That's pretty negative.

06:59.044 --> 07:00.962
Oh.

06:59.044 --> 07:00.962
I didn't mean to be.

07:01.004 --> 07:03.131
What we mean to be

07:01.004 --> 07:03.131
doesn't matter.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.550
It's what we do be.

07:08.011 --> 07:09.012
Ohh.

07:10.222 --> 07:10.972
Hey.

07:12.849 --> 07:16.270
Why do you think I get so

07:12.849 --> 07:16.270
nervous in public restrooms?

07:17.271 --> 07:20.065
Well, there could be

07:17.271 --> 07:20.065
a lot of reasons for...

07:20.941 --> 07:22.483
Hey, what's that

07:20.941 --> 07:22.483
in your hand?

07:23.068 --> 07:25.070
Oh, I bought this

07:23.068 --> 07:25.070
for your mom to protect her

07:25.112 --> 07:26.529
when she's out

07:25.112 --> 07:26.529
at night alone.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.573
See, if a bad person

07:26.571 --> 07:28.573
bothers her,

07:28.823 --> 07:30.992
she just touches

07:28.823 --> 07:30.992
this to him and...

07:31.034 --> 07:32.119
(zapping)

07:32.369 --> 07:33.287
Cool.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.455
Is it deadly?

07:35.496 --> 07:36.998
No, no, no. It doesn't cause

07:35.496 --> 07:36.998
permanent damage.

07:37.582 --> 07:38.458
Oh.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.877
But it's extremely painful.

07:41.586 --> 07:42.754
Ohh.

07:49.428 --> 07:50.720
Okay, who's going to start?

07:50.762 --> 07:51.388
You start.

07:51.430 --> 07:52.431
No, you start.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.432
I don't want to start.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.641
It's my house,

07:53.473 --> 07:54.641
I make the rules.

07:54.682 --> 07:55.934
Well, why'd you ask me

07:54.682 --> 07:55.934
who's going to start

07:55.976 --> 07:57.144
if you knew

07:55.976 --> 07:57.144
you wanted me to start?

07:57.185 --> 07:57.894
Are you serious?

07:57.936 --> 07:59.729
(talking at once)

08:00.188 --> 08:01.022
Hey, guys!

08:01.398 --> 08:02.941
Oh, hey, Jasper.

08:01.398 --> 08:02.941
Hi there, Jasper.

08:04.318 --> 08:05.693
So, why'd you guys

08:04.318 --> 08:05.693
invite me to dinner?

08:06.361 --> 08:08.738
Pfftt.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.738
What do you mean "why"?

08:09.114 --> 08:10.407
(Charlotte)

08:09.114 --> 08:10.407
Friends don't need

08:09.114 --> 08:10.407
a reason

08:10.449 --> 08:12.367
to invite a friend

08:10.449 --> 08:12.367
for dinner, right?

08:12.784 --> 08:13.743
I guess.

08:13.785 --> 08:14.786
Although we do

08:13.785 --> 08:14.786
have a reason.

08:14.828 --> 08:15.703
There is a reason.

08:16.413 --> 08:17.122
(Henry)

08:16.413 --> 08:17.122
But first,

08:17.872 --> 08:19.333
did you see we made

08:17.872 --> 08:19.333
your favorite dinner?

08:19.374 --> 08:20.250
(gasps)

08:20.500 --> 08:21.626
Fish sticks and peas.

08:23.628 --> 08:24.963
Yeah. Sit down.

08:30.093 --> 08:30.927
Uh..

08:31.886 --> 08:35.307
So, we have something that

08:31.886 --> 08:35.307
we kind of want to tell you.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.185
But first,

08:36.016 --> 08:38.185
you have to promise,

08:38.226 --> 08:41.146
you got to swear that you'll

08:38.226 --> 08:41.146
never tell anyone this secret.

08:41.729 --> 08:43.315
No worries.

08:41.729 --> 08:43.315
I can keep a secret.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.025
Can you?

08:45.984 --> 08:47.527
Yeah.

08:47.568 --> 08:49.196
I never told Charlotte you were

08:47.568 --> 08:49.196
the one who killed her goldfish.

08:49.988 --> 08:50.989
What?

08:51.031 --> 08:52.366
You did not

08:51.031 --> 08:52.366
just say that!

08:53.450 --> 08:54.909
You killed Nemo?

08:54.951 --> 08:56.036
We're getting

08:54.951 --> 08:56.036
off track here.

08:59.039 --> 09:02.042
Now, we want tell you

08:59.039 --> 09:02.042
a big secret,

09:02.083 --> 09:05.462
but you got to seriously swear

09:02.083 --> 09:05.462
that you'll never tell anyone.

09:05.879 --> 09:06.963
Ever, ever.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.467
I swear on

09:08.465 --> 09:10.467
Nemo's grave.

09:10.509 --> 09:12.135
Stop mentioning Nemo.

09:12.177 --> 09:13.803
I can't believe

09:12.177 --> 09:13.803
you killed him.

09:13.845 --> 09:16.848
I tickled his back, he had a

09:13.845 --> 09:16.848
stroke, it wasn't my fault!

09:22.145 --> 09:24.022
Charlotte and I are boyfriend

09:22.145 --> 09:24.022
and girlfriend.

09:29.027 --> 09:29.777
You?

09:31.154 --> 09:31.946
She?

09:32.989 --> 09:33.698
You and she?

09:34.741 --> 09:35.575
You and him?

09:39.204 --> 09:41.622
Dahhh!

09:43.791 --> 09:44.584
Aah.

09:45.460 --> 09:46.294
What?

09:47.628 --> 09:48.755
It's true.

09:49.339 --> 09:50.882
You guys are dating?

09:51.299 --> 09:52.092
We are.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.718
We're deep in love.

09:55.220 --> 09:56.137
Wow.

09:57.514 --> 09:59.682
So you guys, like,

09:57.514 --> 09:59.682
kiss and stuff?

10:02.269 --> 10:04.938
Mm-hmm.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.938
We sure do.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.023
We kiss a lot.

10:09.984 --> 10:10.777
Can I see?

10:12.446 --> 10:15.115
Well,

10:12.446 --> 10:15.115
we can't kiss right now.

10:15.156 --> 10:15.949
Why not?

10:17.451 --> 10:19.369
Because Charlotte

10:17.451 --> 10:19.369
has a mouth sore.

10:21.204 --> 10:23.623
Ewww, gross.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.708
Yeah, it's real gross.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.752
Henry, why don't you take me

10:26.000 --> 10:27.752
to the mouth doctor?

10:27.794 --> 10:28.962
Sure, baby.

10:30.547 --> 10:31.756
Wait, it's nighttime.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.216
I think all

10:31.798 --> 10:33.216
the doctors are closed.

10:33.508 --> 10:35.718
Remember, you promised

10:33.508 --> 10:35.718
that you'd never tell anyone

10:35.760 --> 10:37.011
that we're boyfriend

10:35.760 --> 10:37.011
and girlfriend.

10:37.262 --> 10:39.514
Okay, but where are you

10:37.262 --> 10:39.514
going to take Char--

10:43.518 --> 10:45.228
At least I'm not the only one

10:43.518 --> 10:45.228
who gets mouth sores.

10:47.564 --> 10:48.440
Ow.

10:56.906 --> 10:59.909
So, you guys told

10:56.906 --> 10:59.909
Jasper yesterday, huh?

11:00.243 --> 11:01.411
Yep.

11:00.243 --> 11:01.411
We did.

11:01.744 --> 11:02.537
Ha.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.665
I bet he's already blabbed it

11:03.746 --> 11:05.665
to every kid in your school

11:06.583 --> 11:08.751
and if he did,

11:06.583 --> 11:08.751
it meeeans

11:08.793 --> 11:10.462
♪ I was right and

11:08.793 --> 11:10.462
you were wrong ♪

11:10.504 --> 11:11.963
♪ I was right

11:10.504 --> 11:11.963
and you were wrong ♪

11:12.005 --> 11:13.340
♪ I was right and you

11:12.005 --> 11:13.340
were wrong ♪♪

11:13.381 --> 11:14.299
Hey.

11:14.841 --> 11:15.800
That song's

11:14.841 --> 11:15.800
really repetitive.

11:18.637 --> 11:20.930
(both)

11:18.637 --> 11:20.930
Shh.

11:21.556 --> 11:22.223
I wasn't talking.

11:23.766 --> 11:24.809
Hey Jasper.

11:25.393 --> 11:26.394
What are you doing here?

11:27.145 --> 11:29.523
I can't stop thinking about what

11:27.145 --> 11:29.523
you guys told me last night.

11:29.564 --> 11:30.649
(both)

11:29.564 --> 11:30.649
Shh.

11:30.689 --> 11:31.858
(Jasper)

11:30.689 --> 11:31.858
I didn't say anything.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.944
But man, this secret

11:33.109 --> 11:34.944
is hard to keep.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.238
Ahem. Excuse me.

11:37.696 --> 11:38.657
Excuse me.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.868
Henry, Charlotte,

11:39.366 --> 11:41.868
I'm going to need you guys

11:41.909 --> 11:46.289
to go down to the basement

11:41.909 --> 11:46.289
and mop the walls.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.502
Since when do we have

11:48.375 --> 11:50.502
to mop the walls?

11:51.586 --> 11:52.420
Since now.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.798
But our friend

11:53.880 --> 11:55.798
Jasper's here and--

11:55.840 --> 11:56.924
Oh hey, no worries.

11:57.758 --> 11:59.177
I'll keep your

11:57.758 --> 11:59.177
little friend company.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.402
I think something is up

12:13.358 --> 12:15.402
with those two.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.446
I don't know anything.

12:19.906 --> 12:20.739
(Ray)

12:19.906 --> 12:20.739
You sure?

12:21.491 --> 12:24.244
They seem like,

12:21.491 --> 12:24.244
I don't know,

12:24.285 --> 12:25.912
like there's something

12:24.285 --> 12:25.912
they're not telling me.

12:27.706 --> 12:30.041
Well, I can't help you.

12:31.042 --> 12:31.876
Oh, well.

12:32.586 --> 12:33.961
Aah.

12:35.963 --> 12:38.341
Oh, dear God.

12:35.963 --> 12:38.341
What is that?

12:39.133 --> 12:39.842
Oh, this?

12:40.427 --> 12:43.555
This is just King Tut's

12:40.427 --> 12:43.555
golden bucket.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.391
It is?

12:44.097 --> 12:46.391
I've read about that bucket.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.351
It's over

12:46.433 --> 12:48.351
3,000 years old.

12:49.060 --> 12:49.852
Is it?

12:51.145 --> 12:53.607
Cool. I'm just going to

12:51.145 --> 12:53.607
sell it for 30 bucks.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.484
Thirty? I could have

12:53.940 --> 12:56.484
30 bucks by tomorrow.

12:56.901 --> 12:59.195
I can sell

12:56.901 --> 12:59.195
my grandmother's wheelchair.

13:01.406 --> 13:03.074
So you'll really

13:01.406 --> 13:03.074
sell it to me?

13:03.782 --> 13:04.451
Uh...

13:05.744 --> 13:06.453
No.

13:07.120 --> 13:07.912
No?

13:09.664 --> 13:10.749
<i>(Ray)</i>

13:09.664 --> 13:10.749
<i>See, here's the thing,</i>

13:11.583 --> 13:13.627
<i>I think you know something</i>

13:11.583 --> 13:13.627
<i>about Henry and Charlotte.</i>

13:14.085 --> 13:16.087
Liiike maybe a secret.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.715
(groans)

13:19.215 --> 13:21.050
Aw, Ray's playing dirty.

13:21.092 --> 13:23.261
We should've made a rule

13:21.092 --> 13:23.261
against bucket temptation.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.765
<i>(Ray)</i>

13:24.220 --> 13:26.765
<i>Yeah, I think Henry</i>

13:24.220 --> 13:26.765
<i>and Charlotte have a secret,</i>

13:27.307 --> 13:28.849
and I think you know

13:27.307 --> 13:28.849
what it is.

13:29.892 --> 13:33.020
And I'm not going to sell

13:29.892 --> 13:33.020
King Tut's golden bucket

13:33.062 --> 13:34.731
to a boy who would

13:33.062 --> 13:34.731
keep secrets from me.

13:36.023 --> 13:37.525
But that's not fair.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.486
Mmm,

13:37.567 --> 13:39.486
life isn't fair, son.

13:40.654 --> 13:41.820
You know what life

13:40.654 --> 13:41.820
often is?

13:41.862 --> 13:42.656
What?

13:42.697 --> 13:43.531
Unfair.

13:45.074 --> 13:46.493
(groans)

13:46.534 --> 13:47.619
Come on, jasp.

13:47.661 --> 13:48.827
Stay strong.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.455
<i>(Ray)</i>

13:49.120 --> 13:50.455
<i>Just tell me</i>

13:49.120 --> 13:50.455
<i>what you know.</i>

13:50.705 --> 13:52.290
And you'll be

13:50.705 --> 13:52.290
walking out of here

13:52.332 --> 13:57.003
with King Tut's golden bucket

13:52.332 --> 13:57.003
right in your sweaty hands.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.632
Can I tell you a secret

13:58.546 --> 14:00.632
about someone else?

14:00.674 --> 14:01.549
No.

14:02.133 --> 14:03.217
My mom steals butter

14:02.133 --> 14:03.217
from restaurants.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.177
Don't care.

14:04.218 --> 14:05.219
Not surprised.

14:06.721 --> 14:08.473
Will you please

14:06.721 --> 14:08.473
sell me the bucket?

14:08.515 --> 14:09.848
Tell me the secret.

14:10.391 --> 14:12.811
(grunting)

14:15.062 --> 14:19.192
(grunting)

14:28.368 --> 14:29.786
You did the right thing

14:28.368 --> 14:29.786
coming to me.

14:34.624 --> 14:35.875
(groans)

14:36.459 --> 14:37.752
Don't make that noise.

14:45.844 --> 14:49.430
So, I have this really,

14:45.844 --> 14:49.430
really big secret.

14:49.806 --> 14:50.931
Big secret.

14:49.806 --> 14:50.931
Okay.

14:52.475 --> 14:55.144
And I promised

14:52.475 --> 14:55.144
two friends of mine

14:55.186 --> 14:56.855
that I would never

14:55.186 --> 14:56.855
tell anyone.

14:57.313 --> 14:59.566
Well, that's the tough thing

14:57.313 --> 14:59.566
about secrets.

14:59.607 --> 15:00.775
You know, keeping them.

15:02.360 --> 15:03.403
I know.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.530
But if I tell

15:04.153 --> 15:05.530
someone the secret,

15:05.572 --> 15:09.367
I will get something

15:05.572 --> 15:09.367
I want so bad.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.494
You got to

15:09.743 --> 15:11.494
keep the secret.

15:11.536 --> 15:13.705
Well, how do I resist

15:11.536 --> 15:13.705
the temptation?

15:14.497 --> 15:15.331
With this.

15:15.373 --> 15:16.290
(zapping)

15:16.708 --> 15:17.333
What's that?

15:17.792 --> 15:19.960
This is a learning tool.

15:21.588 --> 15:22.839
Give me your hand.

15:23.548 --> 15:25.383
Okay, now what?

15:25.759 --> 15:26.718
Tell me the secret.

15:27.385 --> 15:28.428
But I'm not supposed to.

15:29.053 --> 15:32.181
It's okay,

15:29.053 --> 15:32.181
I'm a life coach.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.268
Tell me the secret.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.228
All right.

15:38.312 --> 15:39.522
The secret is that--

15:39.564 --> 15:41.148
(zapping)

15:39.564 --> 15:41.148
Dahhh!

15:45.612 --> 15:46.654
Ahh.

15:47.530 --> 15:48.823
Why?

15:50.533 --> 15:52.493
I'm helping you learn

15:50.533 --> 15:52.493
to keep your secret

15:52.535 --> 15:55.079
by causing you pain

15:52.535 --> 15:55.079
when you try to tell it.

15:56.122 --> 15:57.916
Ohhh.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.959
All right,

15:58.374 --> 15:59.959
I get it.

16:00.501 --> 16:04.505
Good. Now...

16:00.501 --> 16:04.505
Tell me the secret.

16:05.172 --> 16:06.800
But I don't want

16:05.172 --> 16:06.800
to get zapped again.

16:07.425 --> 16:08.676
No, no,

16:07.425 --> 16:08.676
we're done with that.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.888
I just need to know your secret

16:09.469 --> 16:11.888
so I can help you more.

16:12.555 --> 16:13.264
Oh.

16:14.808 --> 16:17.226
Okay, don't tell

16:14.808 --> 16:17.226
anyone this, but--

16:17.268 --> 16:18.937
(zapping)

16:17.268 --> 16:18.937
Aahhh.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.401
You always have

16:22.982 --> 16:25.401
to keep a secret.

16:25.443 --> 16:27.194
Okay, I will!

16:28.446 --> 16:30.782
Good.

16:28.446 --> 16:30.782
Now, give me $20.

16:39.206 --> 16:41.793
Can I borrow

16:39.206 --> 16:41.793
your learning tool?

16:49.592 --> 16:50.760
(text message alert)

16:51.678 --> 16:52.345
Who's that?

16:52.386 --> 16:53.680
Jasper.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.139
He just got off the bus

16:53.721 --> 16:55.139
and he's on his way here.

16:55.556 --> 16:56.850
Ohhh.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.978
You mean our friend who's

16:57.350 --> 16:59.978
kept the secret we told him?

17:00.269 --> 17:01.312
That's the Jasper.

17:03.272 --> 17:05.024
The deal is he's got

17:03.272 --> 17:05.024
to keep your fake secret

17:05.065 --> 17:06.275
for a whole week.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.528
Only two days to go.

17:08.820 --> 17:10.279
"Only two days to go."

17:13.073 --> 17:15.702
(Jasper)

17:13.073 --> 17:15.702
Heeey, guys.

17:15.743 --> 17:16.828
Oh hey.

17:17.286 --> 17:17.954
Come to hang?

17:17.996 --> 17:18.746
Nope.

17:19.330 --> 17:21.415
I'm here to talk

17:19.330 --> 17:21.415
to your boss.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.668
Well, gooood.

17:24.335 --> 17:26.086
I like talking to you.

17:27.005 --> 17:28.715
Uhh. Well, actually,

17:27.005 --> 17:28.715
Ray's really busy

17:28.756 --> 17:30.132
and we got a lot of--

17:30.174 --> 17:33.093
- Hey! Henry, Charlotte, please

17:30.174 --> 17:33.093
go down to the basement

17:33.135 --> 17:35.304
aaand rotate

17:33.135 --> 17:35.304
the light bulbs.

17:35.763 --> 17:36.764
Rotate the light bulbs?

17:36.806 --> 17:37.932
What does that even mean?

17:38.599 --> 17:41.101
It means I want you

17:38.599 --> 17:41.101
to unscrew all the light bulbs

17:41.143 --> 17:42.520
and then screw them

17:41.143 --> 17:42.520
back in again.

17:43.103 --> 17:43.855
Off you go.

17:54.866 --> 17:55.825
Hello.

17:56.743 --> 17:57.869
I know why you're here.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.454
You been thinking

17:59.078 --> 18:00.454
about something.

18:01.497 --> 18:02.331
Dreaming.

18:03.917 --> 18:04.918
Thinking and dreaming.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.503
I want that bucket.

18:07.545 --> 18:08.588
I know you do.

18:09.088 --> 18:12.341
$60.

18:09.088 --> 18:12.341
That's double what you asked.

18:12.383 --> 18:13.133
(sighs)

18:13.551 --> 18:14.802
Okay.

18:13.551 --> 18:14.802
I was very clear.

18:15.344 --> 18:16.637
I know you have a secret.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.015
<i>If you want me</i>

18:17.096 --> 18:19.015
<i>to sell you this bucket,</i>

18:19.057 --> 18:20.182
<i>you better start talking.</i>

18:20.683 --> 18:21.851
Keep the secret, buddy.

18:21.893 --> 18:23.269
Don't break, Jasper.

18:23.310 --> 18:25.271
<i>I will not tell you my secret.</i>

18:25.563 --> 18:28.232
This is a simple

18:25.563 --> 18:28.232
business transaction.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.526
My $60 for

18:28.274 --> 18:30.526
King Tut's bucket.

18:30.568 --> 18:31.402
No deal.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.153
Come ooon!

18:33.905 --> 18:34.572
I'll tell you what.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.491
You can have it for free.

18:38.284 --> 18:38.952
Free?

18:39.535 --> 18:41.579
Just tell me

18:39.535 --> 18:41.579
your little secret.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.706
(groans)

18:43.748 --> 18:45.625
Oh, man, this is intense.

18:45.666 --> 18:48.335
Do we really have to unscrew and

18:45.666 --> 18:48.335
rescrew all these light bulbs?

18:48.377 --> 18:49.879
No, shh.

18:49.921 --> 18:51.380
<i>What's it going to be, boy?</i>

18:51.422 --> 18:52.256
(groans)

18:52.506 --> 18:55.051
Bucket. For. The secret.

18:55.093 --> 18:56.260
(groans)

18:56.302 --> 18:57.053
One sec.

18:58.846 --> 19:01.808
(zapping)

18:58.846 --> 19:01.808
Aah.

19:05.478 --> 19:06.270
(sighs)

19:11.150 --> 19:13.193
I will not

19:11.150 --> 19:13.193
tell you my secret.

19:14.112 --> 19:14.862
Yeah!

19:14.904 --> 19:15.822
Atta boy, Jasper.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.281
(sighs)

19:19.075 --> 19:20.159
Hold on,

19:19.075 --> 19:20.159
I'll be right back.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.671
(elevator dings)

19:39.637 --> 19:43.975
Ohhh, you guys think

19:39.637 --> 19:43.975
you're sooo smart.

19:44.976 --> 19:46.811
No, we think

19:44.976 --> 19:46.811
we're so right.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.729
You're just mad

19:46.853 --> 19:48.729
because we proved

19:48.771 --> 19:50.106
Jasper can keep a secret.

19:50.606 --> 19:51.774
It's not over yet.

19:52.150 --> 19:52.775
(beeping)

19:52.817 --> 19:53.776
One french fry.

19:54.276 --> 19:55.486
<i>One french fry.</i>

19:58.531 --> 20:00.992
Wait, what are you going to do

19:58.531 --> 20:00.992
with that french fry?

20:01.367 --> 20:02.201
This.

20:04.996 --> 20:08.582
Aw, Ray, don't feel bad

20:04.996 --> 20:08.582
just because...

20:08.916 --> 20:10.376

20:18.718 --> 20:21.470
Don't count your Jaspers

20:18.718 --> 20:21.470
before they hatch.

20:23.848 --> 20:25.224
What do you think

20:23.848 --> 20:25.224
he meant by that?

20:25.766 --> 20:26.600
I don't know.

20:27.309 --> 20:28.936
But I think it's

20:27.309 --> 20:28.936
from the Bible.

20:35.109 --> 20:35.902
All right.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.988
I have $100 here.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.988
If you'll--

20:39.030 --> 20:39.697
Stop.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.116
I'll sell it to you

20:40.740 --> 20:42.116
for 10 bucks.

20:43.117 --> 20:44.368
Just $10?

20:45.578 --> 20:47.121
Why'd he drop

20:45.578 --> 20:47.121
the price to 10?

20:47.163 --> 20:48.873
That's too low

20:47.163 --> 20:48.873
for a Tut bucket.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.418
Well, you going

20:51.333 --> 20:52.418
to buy the bucket?

20:53.127 --> 20:54.795
I'm not telling you

20:53.127 --> 20:54.795
my secret.

20:55.462 --> 20:56.380
You don't need to.

20:57.173 --> 20:59.175
Henry and Charlotte just told me

20:57.173 --> 20:59.175
down in the basement.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.386
Really? They told you they're

20:59.759 --> 21:02.386
boyfriend and girlfriend?

21:03.096 --> 21:04.222
- No...

21:04.555 --> 21:06.265
But you just did!

21:06.515 --> 21:07.683
(laughs)

21:08.392 --> 21:09.977
Nooo!

21:10.019 --> 21:10.978

21:29.455 --> 21:30.414
Aah!

21:41.550 --> 21:43.636
So...

21:41.550 --> 21:43.636
Why'd you guys break up?

21:46.097 --> 21:47.098
Because he killed

21:46.097 --> 21:47.098
my goldfish.

21:47.140 --> 21:48.224
She has mouth sores.

you guys broke up,

22:34.478 --> 22:35.855
Mmm.
