WEBVTT

00:01.114 --> 00:02.941
Previously on Damages...

00:03.061 --> 00:05.257
Michael's suing me
for custody of Catherine.

00:05.292 --> 00:09.222
My son abandoned his child, I
legally adopted her, and I will

00:09.257 --> 00:11.455
never let him see Catherine.

00:11.490 --> 00:15.039
Social Security card, birth
certificate and the adoption papers.

00:15.159 --> 00:16.123
He's officially yours.

00:16.160 --> 00:17.493
Why do you want
to make a deal with me?

00:17.613 --> 00:19.376
Because you know about the boy.

00:19.496 --> 00:22.257
So you'll give me Erickson
if I keep away from the boy.

00:22.364 --> 00:26.104
- You are gonna burn Erickson for me.
- No, I'm not.

00:26.224 --> 00:27.336
You want me
to blow the whistle?

00:27.371 --> 00:30.807
When Dust Devil goes
public, heads will roll.

00:30.927 --> 00:32.542
Yours is gonna be one of them.

00:32.662 --> 00:34.114
I know who the kid is.

00:34.149 --> 00:38.309
You got three of my men killed
carrying out your personal business.

00:38.429 --> 00:41.511
And if you ever want to see the kid again,
you're gonna take the fall for Dust Devil.

00:41.631 --> 00:43.598
I need this thing with
Sanchez wrapped up quickly.

00:43.634 --> 00:45.768
Now, if Sanchez has to
go, he has to go, but what

00:45.803 --> 00:47.970
pisses me off is you keeping
me out of the loop.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.668
I'll drop the case altogether.

00:49.788 --> 00:51.294
In exchange for what?

00:51.414 --> 00:54.013
Bring Christopher Sanchez home...
alive.

00:54.048 --> 00:57.417
Are you sure that you want
Howard Erickson to go unpunished?

00:57.452 --> 00:59.079
Chris's life is in my hands.

00:59.199 --> 01:01.851
All right, I'll
stay away from the case.

01:58.982 --> 02:01.083
We can't lose this guy.

02:01.119 --> 02:02.084
He's high value.

02:02.119 --> 02:03.887
Don't worry.

02:03.922 --> 02:06.956
We'll get your target out.

02:32.618 --> 02:33.583
Clear!

02:33.619 --> 02:34.584
Clear!

02:43.761 --> 02:45.994
Step it up, guys!

02:51.433 --> 02:53.435
Ow!

02:56.439 --> 02:58.440
Ahh!

03:03.079 --> 03:04.046
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

03:04.082 --> 03:06.115
Go! Go!

03:17.363 --> 03:20.697
Oh...
Oh... Oh... Oh, my God.

03:24.804 --> 03:26.604
Oh, fuck.

03:26.639 --> 03:27.672
Oh, fuck!

03:27.707 --> 03:30.708
- Sanchez, Sanchez...
- Lowry. Lowry.

03:31.745 --> 03:34.279
What the fuck happened?

03:34.314 --> 03:36.247
Okay.

03:37.417 --> 03:38.383
Rayburn!

03:39.853 --> 03:40.819
Franks!

03:40.854 --> 03:41.886
Come on.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.855
Come on, motherfucker, come on!

03:43.891 --> 03:45.056
Lowry, breathe!

03:45.092 --> 03:47.526
Oh, fuck.

03:50.162 --> 03:53.231
What the fuck
happened to my men?

04:22.060 --> 04:29.767
If you are a man of prayer, now
would be a good time to begin.

04:29.802 --> 04:32.769
I've agreed to hand
over all the evidence to

04:32.804 --> 04:35.906
Erickson as soon as he
brings Chris home.

04:35.941 --> 04:37.507
I need you to sign this.

04:37.543 --> 04:41.578
Otherwise, there's no deal.

04:52.554 --> 04:57.825
Ellen, I think
you're making a mistake.

04:57.860 --> 05:02.163
You have everything you
need to win this case.

05:02.199 --> 05:04.699
Chris's safety
is what matters to me.

05:04.735 --> 05:09.371
Erickson is not a
man to negotiate with.

05:09.406 --> 05:12.041
He's just a different
kind of terrorist.

05:12.076 --> 05:14.877
I'm out of options.

05:14.913 --> 05:18.614
Didn't you tell me
that you wanted a case that

05:18.650 --> 05:19.916
would put you on the map?

05:19.951 --> 05:22.419
But I'm not going
to play chicken with

05:22.454 --> 05:25.389
Erickson while Chris's
life is at stake.

05:25.424 --> 05:31.829
Ellen...
this is one of those moments.

05:31.864 --> 05:37.801
If you back down like this, even
once, you will never have the

05:37.837 --> 05:41.639
power to win any of the
cases that you believe in.

05:41.674 --> 05:46.343
Are you going
to sign it or not?

06:41.565 --> 06:44.500
Just do it.

07:11.659 --> 07:16.263
I want you to
drink this, Chris.

07:16.298 --> 07:19.266
It's a sedative.

07:19.301 --> 07:24.571
Trust me, it'll make
everything easier.

08:02.045 --> 08:03.745
What are you doing?

08:03.780 --> 08:06.815
What are you doing?

08:38.346 --> 08:39.312
Hmm.

08:39.347 --> 08:40.313
Erickson.

08:40.347 --> 08:42.515
Good morning, Howard.

08:42.551 --> 08:44.284
It certainly is.

08:44.320 --> 08:45.987
I made a deal with the lawyers.

08:46.022 --> 08:49.324
Miss Parsons is going to settle.

08:49.359 --> 08:52.394
Well, then, you-you
don't need the boy.

08:52.429 --> 08:55.096
Why don't you let me come
by and pick him up?

08:55.132 --> 08:58.066
Well, here's the rub, Jerry.

08:58.102 --> 08:59.668
I just don't trust you anymore.

08:59.704 --> 09:01.703
The feeling's mutual.

09:01.739 --> 09:06.274
I hate to break it to you, Howard,
but, uh, you're no patriot.

09:06.310 --> 09:09.144
You're not even a
good Christian.

09:09.179 --> 09:12.247
Only thing you give a
shit about is money.

09:12.282 --> 09:16.918
As soon as Parsons
settles this case, I'm turning

09:16.954 --> 09:19.187
the boy over to the authorities.

09:19.222 --> 09:23.024
You send that boy
back to Afghanistan, it's a

09:23.059 --> 09:24.459
death sentence.

09:24.494 --> 09:26.560
He's an outcast.

09:26.596 --> 09:30.466
Why the fuck do you think
I took him out of there?

09:30.501 --> 09:34.536
Bye, Jerry.

09:52.723 --> 09:53.855
This is Patty Hewes.

09:53.891 --> 09:58.360
I have some information I'd
like to share with you.

10:03.333 --> 10:04.833
Mr. Owen?

10:04.869 --> 10:07.202
Ms. Hewes.

10:10.374 --> 10:14.009
I thought you should
know that Gerald Boorman met

10:14.045 --> 10:19.381
with me regarding the
case against High Star.

10:19.417 --> 10:21.850
What did Mr. Boorman have to say?

10:21.886 --> 10:27.321
He told me all about the
history of Operation Dust Devil.

10:27.357 --> 10:31.926
How the CIA recruited Howard
Erickson for illegal extractions.

10:31.961 --> 10:34.929
Dust Devil was a stupid
program started under my

10:34.965 --> 10:37.166
predecessor, and I stopped it.

10:37.201 --> 10:41.437
The mission last October
that killed three High

10:41.472 --> 10:46.009
Star employees was a
Dust Devil operation.

10:50.048 --> 10:54.919
Why was the CIA pulling
out that boy?

10:57.189 --> 10:59.224
Who is he?

11:00.893 --> 11:06.499
Mr. Owen, one way or another,
everything I know is going

11:06.535 --> 11:10.970
public, so you have two choices.

11:11.006 --> 11:16.576
You can either be the hero that
cleans up the agency, or the guy

11:16.611 --> 11:20.513
who destroys his career
trying to protect it.

11:24.784 --> 11:27.018
Boorman told me
Erickson went rogue on that

11:27.054 --> 11:31.389
mission, but if this is who they
got out, it's clear he lied to me.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.724
Who is the boy?

11:33.760 --> 11:34.993
Kosha Durani.

11:35.028 --> 11:38.130
His mother was an
asset of Boorman's.

11:38.165 --> 11:40.332
He got valuable
information from her.

11:40.368 --> 11:42.768
But then he got too close.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.737
Too close how?

11:44.772 --> 11:48.307
They had an
intimate relationship.

11:48.342 --> 11:51.610
When the mullahs found out the
boy's mother was sleeping with

11:51.645 --> 11:55.848
an infidel, she was
put on trial.

11:55.883 --> 11:59.018
We believe that she
was executed.

11:59.054 --> 12:03.223
So the child-- was
Boorman the father?

12:03.258 --> 12:06.660
It's not like we went
in to get a DNA test.

12:06.695 --> 12:07.661
I can't say.

12:07.696 --> 12:13.534
Would the agency attest to
all of this in a court of law?

12:13.570 --> 12:18.273
Obviously, Boorman and
High Star are a problem for us.

12:20.043 --> 12:23.980
If you've got a solution,
I'm listening.

12:36.593 --> 12:38.928
I don't like this one.

12:38.963 --> 12:40.095
We're not ready.

12:42.466 --> 12:46.066
This whole thing's been put
together at the last minute.

12:46.102 --> 12:47.067
It's bullshit.

12:47.103 --> 12:51.704
This is a high-value
target, and our window's closing.

12:51.740 --> 12:54.041
Fuck it.

12:54.076 --> 12:55.408
This is it, man.

12:55.444 --> 12:59.412
I promised my wife I'm going home
and I'm driving a school bus.

12:59.448 --> 13:01.448
Lowry! Come on.

13:01.483 --> 13:03.116
Come on, motherfucker, come on!

13:03.151 --> 13:05.018
Look at me, Lowry! Lowry!

13:05.053 --> 13:07.087
Breathe!

13:34.648 --> 13:37.916
Welcome back to the States.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.484
Change your clothes.

13:39.519 --> 13:43.587
Your friend Ellen Parsons cut
a deal to save your life.

13:45.791 --> 13:49.526
March 18, 2011.

13:49.562 --> 13:53.297
I'm alive, Ellen.

13:53.332 --> 13:55.365
I'm alive.

13:59.437 --> 14:02.273
Grip it, like that.

14:02.309 --> 14:04.275
Yeah. You'll get the hang of it.

14:05.312 --> 14:06.678
Yeah.

14:06.713 --> 14:07.912
You wanted to see me?

14:07.948 --> 14:10.915
Yeah. I'm gonna be
conducting business in the office shortly.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.750
Do me a favor and watch the kid.

14:12.786 --> 14:13.751
Of course.

14:13.787 --> 14:15.786
Okay.

14:15.821 --> 14:21.191
You go
with my friend, A.C.

14:21.227 --> 14:23.127
You'll have fun.

14:23.162 --> 14:25.496
He'll show you around.

14:27.265 --> 14:29.833
Keep him in the warehouse in
the north end-- he could play

14:29.869 --> 14:31.702
around up there.

14:31.737 --> 14:33.269
Be nice to him; he's a good kid.

14:34.306 --> 14:36.339
Yes, sir.

14:39.745 --> 14:40.711
Erickson.

14:40.746 --> 14:42.712
Mr. Erickson, I'm
leaving for the High Star

14:42.748 --> 14:43.713
compound now.

14:43.749 --> 14:46.550
If Ms. Hewes doesn't hear from
me within six hours, she's

14:46.586 --> 14:48.085
contacting the authorities.

14:48.120 --> 14:50.154
Understood.

14:52.023 --> 14:55.726
I know your position
on this, Patty, but...

14:55.762 --> 14:58.563
I'm not changing my mind.

14:58.598 --> 15:01.032
Clarity can be useful.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.568
Yeah, it can.

15:48.480 --> 15:53.083
Ms. Hewes, I'd much rather
do this with your attorney present.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.953
I am my attorney.

15:55.988 --> 15:57.588
I'll be representing myself.

15:57.623 --> 16:01.291
Well, as you know, my client is
seeking joint custody of his daughter,

16:01.327 --> 16:02.292
Catherine.

16:02.327 --> 16:05.962
Yes, and as you know, I'm
Catherine's legal guardian.

16:05.998 --> 16:08.798
To get custody, you're going to
have to prove that I perpetrated

16:08.834 --> 16:12.735
fraud... or used coercion
in order to adopt her.

16:12.771 --> 16:15.071
The fraud you
perpetrated was convincing the

16:15.106 --> 16:16.639
State you were a fit mother.

16:16.674 --> 16:18.908
Michael, let me do the talking.

16:18.943 --> 16:21.176
Since you are the opposing
attorney, I will get you a list

16:21.211 --> 16:23.612
of the witnesses
we'd like to call.

16:23.647 --> 16:26.881
Ah, yes, a parade of
character assassins to testify

16:26.916 --> 16:30.418
to my... maternal limitations.

16:30.453 --> 16:33.588
I'm just wondering who you
managed to dig up, Michael.

16:33.623 --> 16:36.958
Some of your old baby-sitters?

16:36.994 --> 16:40.963
Daniel Purcell...
a self-confessed wife murderer?

16:40.999 --> 16:43.232
Who's Daniel Purcell?

16:43.268 --> 16:45.035
My real father.

16:45.070 --> 16:46.770
Phil the adulterer?

16:46.806 --> 16:49.606
My stepfather.

16:49.642 --> 16:52.343
Who else?

16:52.378 --> 16:55.312
Because I can assure you,
whoever you find to attack my

16:55.348 --> 17:00.184
character, I will be more than
ready to decimate theirs.

17:02.220 --> 17:03.320
We'll see.

17:03.355 --> 17:04.421
As I said, Ms.

17:04.455 --> 17:08.058
Hewes, we'll get you a
list of our witnesses.

17:08.093 --> 17:11.461
I'm looking forward to it.

17:24.642 --> 17:25.608
Hello.

17:25.643 --> 17:27.476
Ellen Parsons.

17:27.512 --> 17:28.611
Hello?

17:28.646 --> 17:30.679
I have a gun.

17:30.715 --> 17:32.748
Don't turn around.

17:36.720 --> 17:40.657
Now, don't worry, I'm
not here to hurt you.

17:40.692 --> 17:42.993
We both want something
from Howard Erickson.

17:43.028 --> 17:47.898
I know you're trying to work a deal
with him for Chris Sanchez's life.

17:47.933 --> 17:50.834
And what has
Erickson got that you want?

17:50.870 --> 17:52.503
The boy.

17:52.538 --> 17:57.508
I'm not interrogating the
kid, I'm protecting him.

17:57.544 --> 18:00.578
Well, Patty didn't
believe you, and neither do I.

18:00.614 --> 18:04.248
I don't care if
you don't believe me.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.084
I have a gun.

18:06.119 --> 18:10.321
So, you're gonna help
me get the kid back.

18:10.356 --> 18:13.125
Now, drive.

18:39.354 --> 18:41.388
Huh?

18:47.527 --> 18:49.495
'Kay?

19:11.117 --> 19:15.820
Rayburn, Franks, Lowry.

19:15.856 --> 19:17.923
You knew them.

19:17.958 --> 19:20.025
These were your men.

19:20.060 --> 19:23.095
Do you know how they died?

19:25.898 --> 19:27.131
Everybody in.

19:27.167 --> 19:28.299
You boys ready?

19:28.335 --> 19:29.901
Come on, Tommy.

19:29.936 --> 19:31.369
Whoo-hoo!

19:31.404 --> 19:33.605
Everyone,
"Double D's" on three.

19:33.640 --> 19:34.639
One, two, three!

19:34.675 --> 19:36.875
Double D's!

19:57.498 --> 19:58.498
Hey!

19:58.533 --> 20:00.567
Who's there?

20:02.836 --> 20:04.804
Is someone there?

20:04.839 --> 20:08.473
You were right--
Owen is Boorman's handler.

20:08.509 --> 20:09.474
Really?

20:09.510 --> 20:11.476
So, what did the
prick have to say?

20:11.512 --> 20:14.713
He was very
cooperative, actually.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.551
Is anyone there?

20:18.586 --> 20:22.723
I'm hungry.

20:22.758 --> 20:25.793
I need something to eat.

20:35.338 --> 20:36.939
Hey!

20:36.974 --> 20:40.242
Come back!

20:40.277 --> 20:43.812
Come back, you can
come back in here.

20:59.561 --> 21:02.296
I see you, before.

21:05.600 --> 21:08.301
With... gun.

21:10.939 --> 21:14.575
What the fuck
happened to my men?

21:21.182 --> 21:24.718
Who brought you here?

21:24.754 --> 21:28.589
Boorman?

21:28.625 --> 21:33.461
Th-The man that I was...
with that day, did he bring you here?

21:35.998 --> 21:37.332
Yes.

21:37.367 --> 21:39.401
Many men, yes.

21:41.937 --> 21:48.409
My unit... um, the men who
came to get you...

21:48.444 --> 21:50.945
I'm sorry.

21:50.980 --> 21:52.480
We never should have done that.

21:52.515 --> 21:54.549
Um...

21:59.888 --> 22:02.923
You... do not see.

22:04.927 --> 22:07.262
Uh, see what?

22:07.297 --> 22:09.331
The men.

22:13.035 --> 22:15.070
All die.

22:19.442 --> 22:23.011
You saw all the men die?

22:25.814 --> 22:29.218
Please tell me.

22:29.253 --> 22:32.288
Tell me what you saw.

22:37.228 --> 22:38.194
Clear!

22:38.229 --> 22:39.429
Clear!

22:44.036 --> 22:46.070
Wait out here.

23:10.928 --> 23:12.427
Goddamn it!

23:12.463 --> 23:14.096
We've got to move.

23:16.334 --> 23:17.733
Jesus, who the fuck is that?

23:17.769 --> 23:18.734
Our target.

23:18.770 --> 23:19.736
We're pulling him out.

23:19.771 --> 23:21.905
Step it up, guys!

23:21.940 --> 23:23.907
Make sure this
perimeter is secure.

23:23.942 --> 23:25.376
We're taking him out of here.

24:09.055 --> 24:12.525
Are you sure you saw all that?

24:29.808 --> 24:32.610
Step out of the car.

24:38.150 --> 24:40.185
May I?

24:48.061 --> 24:50.129
You can come with me.

24:50.164 --> 24:52.364
Search the inside, too.

25:01.641 --> 25:04.410
So Boorman basically
kidnapped the kid.

25:04.445 --> 25:08.047
And the CIA isn't
interested in protecting Boorman.

25:08.082 --> 25:09.215
Good! We can't lose.

25:09.250 --> 25:11.350
Take this thing
to court already.

25:11.385 --> 25:13.786
Man, let's sue the shit
out of these people, huh?

25:13.821 --> 25:15.120
I can't.

25:15.156 --> 25:16.288
Why can't you?

25:16.324 --> 25:18.824
Ellen settled the case.

25:18.860 --> 25:20.826
Well, how could
you let her do that?

25:20.862 --> 25:22.929
I said I'd support
her; I signed off on it.

25:22.964 --> 25:25.097
That is such shit!

25:25.133 --> 25:28.234
I mean, how could you do that?!

25:28.270 --> 25:30.303
So what happens to Boorman now?

25:30.338 --> 25:31.538
And High Star?

25:31.573 --> 25:33.673
What, they get off with a
fuckin' slap on the wrist, huh?

25:33.708 --> 25:35.675
I'm still gonna try a case.

25:35.710 --> 25:37.677
I just need a
different plaintiff.

25:37.712 --> 25:39.679
Where are you gonna
find another plaintiff?

25:39.714 --> 25:43.316
The Alien Torts Act.

25:43.351 --> 25:45.318
R... Right.

25:45.353 --> 25:48.121
I can file a complaint
on behalf of a foreign citizen.

25:48.156 --> 25:50.657
The boy! Of course!

25:50.692 --> 25:52.024
Yeah, but we can't wait.

25:52.060 --> 25:53.025
I mean, you got to file today.

25:53.061 --> 25:56.329
We don't know what's gonna
happen to this kid.

25:56.364 --> 26:00.366
Maggie, call
Judge Powloski's clerk.

26:00.402 --> 26:03.636
I told you to wait upstairs.

26:10.177 --> 26:12.545
Ellen Parsons is
on the compound.

26:12.580 --> 26:15.714
If she delivers what she promised,
then you'll be free to go.

26:15.749 --> 26:22.520
A.C., that boy...
he was the target we took out.

26:22.556 --> 26:23.555
Bullshit.

26:23.590 --> 26:27.625
No, he... Boorman said
he-he had high-value information.

26:27.660 --> 26:29.626
That boy can't be
older than 12 years old.

26:29.662 --> 26:30.861
Listen to me, okay?

26:30.896 --> 26:33.062
I just... I just need you
to fuckin' listen to me.

26:33.098 --> 26:34.063
He was there.

26:34.099 --> 26:35.765
He saw how our guys died!

26:35.800 --> 26:39.002
Chris, what are
you talking about?

27:04.196 --> 27:07.864
Ms. Parsons, welcome.

27:07.900 --> 27:12.402
You remember Mr. Shaw, my attorney?

27:12.438 --> 27:14.771
Why don't we have a seat?

27:14.807 --> 27:20.110
I have everything you
requested-- evidence from Mr. Boorman...

27:20.145 --> 27:24.747
agreement signed by all parties.

27:24.782 --> 27:28.117
Make sure this is kosher, Jack.

27:31.621 --> 27:32.721
Where is he?

27:32.757 --> 27:38.928
Well, if the agreement checks
out, you'll be seeing him shortly.

27:38.963 --> 27:41.998
Why don't you have a seat?

27:55.147 --> 27:56.514
Are you kidding?

27:56.550 --> 27:58.851
You really thought you
could get away with this?

27:58.886 --> 28:00.853
What are you talking about?

28:00.888 --> 28:02.855
Th-The
settlement's no good?

28:02.890 --> 28:04.523
The settlement's fine.

28:04.558 --> 28:07.392
Patty Hewes is suing us.

28:07.428 --> 28:08.393
What?

28:08.429 --> 28:12.597
She's filed a new
lawsuit with a new plaintiff.

28:12.632 --> 28:15.633
I just received this
from the court.

28:15.669 --> 28:16.835
Who's the plaintiff?

28:16.870 --> 28:21.539
A 12-year-old Afghani boy.

28:21.575 --> 28:23.608
Kosha Durani.

28:25.711 --> 28:27.645
Maybe you should see this.

28:27.681 --> 28:29.647
Unless you already
know about it.

28:29.683 --> 28:31.649
Of course she does.

28:31.685 --> 28:36.687
They want you to settle this case so
they can turn around and file another.

28:39.557 --> 28:41.691
You didn't
know about it, did you?

28:41.727 --> 28:45.795
Patty Hewes went
behind your back.

28:45.830 --> 28:51.667
Either way...
you and I no longer have a deal.

28:54.772 --> 29:00.010
Where is Chris Sanchez?

29:00.046 --> 29:04.649
I'm afraid Mr. Sanchez
is still in Afghanistan.

29:04.684 --> 29:08.253
If you'll excuse me, I have
some business to take care of.

29:15.429 --> 29:21.065
How do you know that
kid is telling you the truth?

29:21.101 --> 29:25.169
Why would he lie?

29:25.204 --> 29:27.571
Think about it.

29:35.212 --> 29:38.182
Let's just hope Ellen
Parsons comes through for you.

29:38.217 --> 29:40.150
Why would he lie?

29:40.186 --> 29:42.220
Why would he lie?

29:59.304 --> 30:04.007
Patty Hewes
filed a new lawsuit.

30:04.043 --> 30:05.575
You know what has to be done.

30:05.610 --> 30:06.576
Sanchez?

30:06.611 --> 30:08.611
Make it look
like we talked about.

30:08.646 --> 30:11.147
I want video evidence.

30:11.182 --> 30:17.954
And before you do it...
I want Sanchez to hear from me personally.

30:17.989 --> 30:21.791
What do you mean, sir?

30:28.500 --> 30:30.802
What the fuck are you doing?

30:30.837 --> 30:32.804
I assume you've heard by now.

30:32.839 --> 30:33.805
I'm taking down High Star.

30:33.840 --> 30:35.840
Drop your case now.

30:35.875 --> 30:38.542
I'm afraid I can't do that.

30:38.577 --> 30:41.178
Do not fuck with me, Patty.

30:41.213 --> 30:42.179
You'll regret this.

30:42.214 --> 30:43.280
Good-bye, Ellen.

30:43.315 --> 30:45.349
Patty!

30:48.420 --> 30:49.953
Who's there?

30:49.989 --> 30:52.990
A.C.?

30:53.025 --> 30:57.661
Praise God...
and good evening.

30:57.697 --> 31:00.231
Fills my heart with joy to
be here with you tonight.

31:00.266 --> 31:03.168
Mr. Erickson would
like you to watch this.

31:03.203 --> 31:06.638
This week my six-year-old
son made a Christmas card for me.

31:06.673 --> 31:08.640
What the fuck is this?

31:08.675 --> 31:13.812
It said "Peace on Earth...
goodwill to all men."

31:16.182 --> 31:18.818
"Peace on Earth."

31:20.922 --> 31:23.490
I don't know what Patty
Hewes is trying to do, but

31:23.525 --> 31:26.560
you have my word, if you deliver
Chris Sanchez to me, he will

31:26.596 --> 31:28.930
never testify against you.

31:28.965 --> 31:31.532
Ms.
Parsons, our business is over.

31:31.568 --> 31:35.902
Right now your problem isn't
Chris Sanchez, it's Gerald Boorman.

31:35.938 --> 31:37.971
He's on the compound.

31:40.074 --> 31:42.241
I doubt that very much.

31:42.276 --> 31:45.377
I drove him in myself.

31:54.454 --> 31:55.420
South gate.

31:55.455 --> 31:57.421
Why isn't north gate answering?

31:57.457 --> 31:58.956
I don't know, sir.

32:01.927 --> 32:05.697
I tell you, your
suffering is not in vain.

32:05.732 --> 32:15.840
The pain you endure, no matter how unbearable...
will bring you closer to God.

32:46.473 --> 32:49.609
That was very enlightening.

32:52.947 --> 32:57.985
I thought you said Ellen
Parsons made a deal.

32:59.188 --> 33:02.423
Stop what you're doing--
Jerry Boorman's on the compound.

33:02.458 --> 33:03.424
Meaning what?

33:03.459 --> 33:04.558
Meaning find him.

33:04.594 --> 33:05.826
What about Sanchez?

33:05.862 --> 33:06.927
Forget Sanchez.

33:06.962 --> 33:07.928
Get Boorman.

33:07.963 --> 33:12.466
Use whatever force necessary.

33:12.501 --> 33:13.867
It's Erickson.

33:13.903 --> 33:15.936
Change of plans.

33:25.148 --> 33:27.116
I've thought about it, Sanchez.

33:27.151 --> 33:31.654
What you told me about
the boy, I believe you.

34:15.632 --> 34:19.168
I was happy to hear from you.

34:19.204 --> 34:22.871
You've come a long way since
sneaking wine coolers into proms.

35:21.998 --> 35:24.933
Kosha?

35:43.087 --> 35:45.188
Ms. Parsons.

35:45.224 --> 35:46.189
Who are you?

35:46.225 --> 35:48.192
I know where Chris is.

35:48.227 --> 35:50.428
I'll take you to him.

35:52.830 --> 35:54.798
I'll get the car and
I'll be back for you.

35:54.833 --> 35:56.800
Is Chris really alive?

35:56.835 --> 35:58.902
He's fine.

35:58.937 --> 36:02.338
He's right in there.

36:02.373 --> 36:04.406
I'll be back.

37:24.753 --> 37:27.020
Congratulations.

37:27.056 --> 37:30.591
This is your last session.

37:30.626 --> 37:33.527
So have I been reformed?

37:33.562 --> 37:37.999
Can I reenter civilized society?

37:38.035 --> 37:40.035
Absolutely.

37:40.070 --> 37:44.741
I'll send in the
paperwork today.

37:44.776 --> 37:47.043
You'll be free.

37:47.078 --> 37:50.581
So any...
parting words of wisdom?

37:50.616 --> 37:54.285
Don't slam doors
in people's faces.

37:58.290 --> 38:00.491
Anything you want to talk about?

38:02.628 --> 38:06.565
Not particularly.

38:06.601 --> 38:08.633
Okay.

38:11.671 --> 38:17.310
May I ask how things are, uh...
going with your son?

38:17.346 --> 38:19.546
We'll be going to court.

38:19.581 --> 38:21.248
Mm.

38:21.284 --> 38:24.518
Are you worried you're gonna lose
custody of your granddaughter?

38:24.554 --> 38:25.887
No.

38:25.922 --> 38:28.957
The law is entirely on my side.

38:31.928 --> 38:39.234
Whatever happened with that...
that young woman we were talking about?

38:39.270 --> 38:44.706
After I decided to help her, she...
quit on me.

38:44.741 --> 38:46.507
She's dropping the case.

38:46.542 --> 38:49.743
Are you disappointed in her?

38:57.652 --> 39:00.421
No.

39:00.456 --> 39:03.391
That's who she is.

39:03.427 --> 39:08.331
She's good...
but she's not a force.

39:08.366 --> 39:11.401
Mm, not many people are.

39:11.436 --> 39:14.905
The problem is, she wants
to be, she wants to... get

39:14.941 --> 39:18.575
out from under my shadow.

39:18.611 --> 39:21.112
But she'll never be able to.

39:21.147 --> 39:22.113
I won't let her.

39:22.148 --> 39:25.517
She's still useful to me.

39:25.552 --> 39:27.586
I see.

39:56.283 --> 39:59.085
Aw, Sanchez.

40:02.189 --> 40:06.193
We have to stay together, okay?

40:19.306 --> 40:22.875
Chris?

40:22.911 --> 40:24.177
Come on.

40:24.212 --> 40:25.845
Let's go.

40:25.880 --> 40:28.215
Move. Let's go.

41:36.620 --> 41:38.821
Thank you.

41:44.493 --> 41:47.062
Can you... can you help me?

41:58.506 --> 42:01.474
Kosha?

42:06.813 --> 42:08.847
Kosha?

42:11.983 --> 42:12.950
Come on.

42:12.985 --> 42:15.185
I'm gonna take you home.

42:17.189 --> 42:19.523
Hey... come on.

42:19.558 --> 42:20.791
Come on!

42:29.167 --> 42:31.235
Meet me outside.

42:31.270 --> 42:33.871
Go!

42:43.414 --> 42:45.249
Franks.

42:45.284 --> 42:47.951
Rayburn.

42:47.987 --> 42:51.588
Lowry.

42:51.624 --> 42:54.658
What about 'em?

42:57.628 --> 43:00.263
See this?

43:00.299 --> 43:03.600
This is all I have
left from my men.

43:03.635 --> 43:05.535
This.

43:09.006 --> 43:10.972
Aah!

43:14.578 --> 43:20.115
Those men were hired
to complete a mission.

43:21.884 --> 43:23.918
And they refused.

43:32.929 --> 43:34.996
Jesus, who the fuck is that?

43:35.031 --> 43:35.997
Our target.

43:36.032 --> 43:38.766
We're pulling him out.

43:38.801 --> 43:39.934
No, we're not.

43:39.969 --> 43:41.069
He's a fuckin' kid.

43:41.104 --> 43:43.371
He's got valuable information.

43:43.407 --> 43:45.473
What information
can a child have?!

43:45.509 --> 43:50.078
You get paid to do a
job-- now, shut up and do it.

43:50.113 --> 43:52.146
Make sure this
perimeter is secure.

43:52.182 --> 43:53.381
We're taking him out of here.

43:53.417 --> 43:54.383
Fuck that.

43:54.418 --> 43:56.384
I'm not doing this
shit to a kid.

43:56.420 --> 43:59.320
We're not gonna let you take
him, we're leaving him.

43:59.356 --> 44:01.589
I'm telling
you, he's got intel!

44:01.625 --> 44:04.592
Yeah, you gonna torture him?

44:04.627 --> 44:06.094
We need him!

44:16.738 --> 44:19.207
Sorry, man, I can't do it.

44:19.242 --> 44:20.208
I'm out.

44:20.243 --> 44:24.212
We're not letting you take him.

44:24.247 --> 44:26.280
Listen...

44:28.584 --> 44:30.618
Listen to me.

44:35.091 --> 44:41.030
The boy...

44:50.009 --> 44:51.843
Let's go!

44:51.878 --> 44:53.878
We got to move now!

44:55.848 --> 44:59.884
The boy... he's my son.

44:59.919 --> 45:01.719
We got to move!

45:08.059 --> 45:10.159
What the fuck's going on?!

45:17.000 --> 45:20.035
He's my son.

45:23.239 --> 45:27.643
Ah, you don't believe me?

45:31.549 --> 45:34.116
Oh, shit.

45:44.061 --> 45:46.095
Come on.

45:57.108 --> 45:59.476
I did it.

46:03.447 --> 46:06.216
I shot your men.

46:28.306 --> 46:30.974
You know what?

46:36.781 --> 46:39.184
I'd do it again.

46:42.222 --> 46:44.056
I'd do it again!

46:55.536 --> 47:00.139
I am so sorry for the terrible ordeal
that you've been through, Mr. Sanchez.

47:05.111 --> 47:11.183
I knew we were extracting
human targets for interrogation.

47:11.218 --> 47:16.355
And I knew... it was illegal.

47:16.390 --> 47:18.623
Then why did you do it?

47:18.659 --> 47:21.326
I was told Dust Devil
was necessary for national

47:21.362 --> 47:27.366
security, that it was
authorized by the CIA.

47:27.401 --> 47:30.601
Has the CIA been able
to verify Gerald Boorman's

47:30.637 --> 47:34.105
criminal involvement in everything
Mr. Sanchez has said here today?

47:34.140 --> 47:35.106
Yes.

47:35.141 --> 47:37.475
Gerald Boorman was a
disgrace to the agency.

47:37.511 --> 47:41.445
In light of that, I've
secured a guarantee from the CIA

47:41.481 --> 47:47.317
that they won't make any more
inquiries into Mr. Boorman's death.

47:47.352 --> 47:50.420
I'm not looking
for special treatment.

47:50.455 --> 47:54.390
Mr. Sanchez, we would
prefer there be no investigation.

47:54.425 --> 47:58.395
It would not be
beneficial to the agency.

47:58.430 --> 48:03.935
We are not seeking
to prosecute anyone.

48:03.970 --> 48:07.539
Ellen said the families
of my men will be taken care of.

48:07.574 --> 48:13.179
Yes, your testimony against
Howard Erickson will ensure it.

48:13.215 --> 48:15.682
And what's going
to happen to the company?

48:15.718 --> 48:18.351
High Star will be put
out of business, and Howard

48:18.387 --> 48:19.920
Erickson will go to prison.

48:19.955 --> 48:23.190
I think we're done here.

48:23.225 --> 48:25.259
Yes.

48:25.294 --> 48:25.993
For now.

48:26.028 --> 48:27.461
Thank you, sir.

48:27.496 --> 48:28.562
Mm-hmm.

48:28.597 --> 48:30.630
Thank you.

48:44.578 --> 48:50.350
The Lord...
works in mysterious ways.

48:50.385 --> 48:53.220
But it's not our place
to question His will.

48:53.255 --> 48:58.058
We wake every morning ready
to fulfill His plan for us.

48:58.094 --> 49:01.129
It's time, Mr. Erickson.

49:14.644 --> 49:22.284
We need to be brave...
and strong.

49:22.320 --> 49:35.664
And... even if I don't know the Lord's plan...
well, I know that I love you boys.

49:35.699 --> 49:39.133
And I love this country.

49:39.168 --> 49:40.134
I don't understand.

49:40.169 --> 49:41.735
Why aren't you trying the case?

49:41.771 --> 49:45.906
I still believe in the
case, and I want Patty to win it.

49:45.941 --> 49:47.340
I-I just can't be involved.

49:47.375 --> 49:51.410
Okay.

49:55.516 --> 49:59.320
I thought about
you when you were gone.

49:59.355 --> 50:01.989
Yeah, I thought about you, too.

50:02.025 --> 50:08.530
I mean...
I thought about you a lot.

50:10.533 --> 50:13.569
Ellen, I...

50:15.772 --> 50:19.641
I'm not really in the...
best state of mind these days.

50:19.676 --> 50:23.177
Oh, I... I understand.

50:26.280 --> 50:30.283
I'm not sure if
I'd be great company.

50:30.318 --> 50:37.790
Oh, well... whenever you feel
like it-- if you ever feel like it-- and

50:37.825 --> 50:40.159
you're interested, I'm there.

50:40.194 --> 50:41.160
I'm here.

50:42.196 --> 50:43.162
I'm here.

50:43.197 --> 50:45.765
I just wanted to
let you know that.

50:45.801 --> 50:47.099
That's all.

50:47.135 --> 50:51.170
Okay.

51:12.927 --> 51:18.799
I hope you understand
now why I did what I did.

51:21.369 --> 51:24.204
No, I don't.

51:24.239 --> 51:26.573
Chris could have been killed.

51:26.608 --> 51:30.777
You just got lucky.

51:30.813 --> 51:36.449
If you want to win a case
like this, you have to take risks.

51:36.484 --> 51:38.884
I had made a decision.

51:38.920 --> 51:40.820
You went behind my back.

51:40.855 --> 51:45.258
I was saving you from yourself.

51:49.630 --> 51:54.467
You know, everyone wants to
know the story of this case.

51:54.502 --> 51:57.436
Journalists are coming
out of the woodwork.

51:57.471 --> 52:00.005
I want you to take
the interviews.

52:00.041 --> 52:01.340
You deserve the credit.

52:01.375 --> 52:02.608
It's your case now.

52:02.643 --> 52:04.110
I don't want any part of it.

52:04.145 --> 52:05.578
Don't be stupid.

52:05.613 --> 52:07.980
The civil case will
get attention.

52:08.015 --> 52:09.681
It will put you on the map.

52:09.716 --> 52:11.683
You'll win.

52:11.718 --> 52:14.486
You don't get it.

52:14.521 --> 52:19.791
I won when I put Chris
ahead of winning.

52:22.928 --> 52:30.035
I can understand why you're so angry
right now, but you will get over it.

52:35.408 --> 52:43.848
You know...
I've always wanted to find someone...

52:45.984 --> 52:54.224
a woman... who could step into my
shoes, take over the reins someday.

52:54.260 --> 52:57.461
That's not what you want.

52:57.496 --> 53:00.497
You want someone you
can manipulate.

53:00.532 --> 53:06.069
Someone like Tom who'd give you their
life while you sit on your throne.

53:06.104 --> 53:09.238
You know what your
problem is, Patty?

53:09.273 --> 53:13.709
You chose winning over everything--
your husband, your son, me.

53:13.744 --> 53:17.514
All you have in your
life is your next case.

53:17.549 --> 53:19.215
There's nothing else.

53:21.820 --> 53:26.189
You think success
made me lonely?

53:26.224 --> 53:28.992
Failure is lonely.

53:29.027 --> 53:32.996
You want to be
successful and nice.

53:33.031 --> 53:34.498
A mother, a wife.

53:34.533 --> 53:35.733
Well, you can't.

53:35.768 --> 53:38.235
You couldn't, but I can try.

53:38.270 --> 53:40.371
Well, call me when you're 60.

53:40.406 --> 53:44.876
Let me know how that
works out for you.

53:44.911 --> 53:48.947
I am offering you
my hand, Ellen.

53:48.982 --> 53:51.216
I will not offer it again.

53:51.251 --> 53:55.487
You and I can still do
great things together.

53:55.522 --> 53:59.223
I'm not interested.

53:59.258 --> 54:05.094
I have given you
everything you asked for.

54:05.130 --> 54:12.868
You are an ungrateful child, and
you are in for a rude awakening.

54:17.175 --> 54:21.212
Good-bye, Patty.

54:34.261 --> 54:36.495
Do you need any help, Ms.
Parsons?

54:36.530 --> 54:38.497
Oh, thank you, Maggie.

54:38.532 --> 54:41.033
Yes, if you could send this
stuff to my apartment?

54:41.068 --> 54:44.269
Of course.

54:44.304 --> 54:46.171
You won't be coming back?

54:46.206 --> 54:47.572
No.

54:47.608 --> 54:51.843
It was nice working with you.

55:00.318 --> 55:02.420
What is it?

55:02.455 --> 55:07.525
Oh, this was the
first office I ever had.

55:07.560 --> 55:09.860
It made me feel important.

55:09.896 --> 55:12.096
Well, you are important.

55:12.132 --> 55:16.166
You got to work for Patty Hewes.

55:26.611 --> 55:29.046
So you
have filed a wrongful death

55:29.081 --> 55:30.047
lawsuit against the company?

55:30.082 --> 55:31.048
Yes.

55:31.083 --> 55:35.186
Three High Star employees were killed,
and I'm representing their families.

55:35.221 --> 55:38.290
But you also filed a
second suit, and that claim was

55:38.325 --> 55:41.894
on behalf of a 12-year-old
Afghan boy, correct?

55:41.929 --> 55:42.895
Yes, that's right.

55:42.930 --> 55:47.200
This child was abducted by High Star
for the purposes of interrogation.

55:47.235 --> 55:50.437
Unbelievable.

55:54.609 --> 56:00.780
I was in the neighborhood,
so I thought I'd drop this off.

56:00.815 --> 56:02.948
Our list of witnesses.

56:02.983 --> 56:08.053
And how many people have
you found to testify against me?

56:10.356 --> 56:12.891
It's all in there.

56:12.926 --> 56:16.294
Have a good night.

56:17.663 --> 56:21.533
I think corruption is corruption,
no matter where you find it.

56:21.568 --> 56:22.834
That's why we have civil cases.

56:22.869 --> 56:25.470
Well, when it comes to
toppling the forces of greed,

56:25.505 --> 56:28.106
you are like a one-woman
wrecking ball.

56:28.141 --> 56:32.943
Oh, well... You have
single-handedly brought High Star to justice.

56:32.978 --> 56:35.278
Somebody had to
stop Howard Erickson.

56:35.314 --> 56:38.281
Well, we're certainly
grateful for your courage.

56:38.317 --> 56:39.282
Thank you.

56:39.318 --> 56:42.886
Thank you, Ms. Hewes.
