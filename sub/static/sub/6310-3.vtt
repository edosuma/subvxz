You protect Martin from the FBI.

00:06.621 --> 00:08.161

00:08.162 --> 00:09.663
What brings you back to Prague?

00:09.829 --> 00:11.989
How much did my brother and I pay you?

00:11.990 --> 00:13.325
I will take care of it.

00:13.326 --> 00:14.954

You took care of me and my mum

Do you mind carrying
my backpack through?

00:23.845 --> 00:27.452
Kate's in trouble. She's on her way to Paris
with some kid who's gonna martyr himself.

00:27.453 --> 00:28.757
Watch the bumps, eh?

00:30.665 --> 00:34.622

00:36.890 --> 00:38.089
You still alive in there?

00:39.726 --> 00:41.259

00:44.836 --> 00:46.814
All right, look, Paris
is about 300 clicks.

00:46.850 --> 00:49.484
We gotta ditch this car
and find us a new ride.

00:49.519 --> 00:51.602
Nina's gonna be on our
ass, so we gotta move.

00:51.604 --> 00:53.071
There's no "we."

00:54.454 --> 00:56.474
- What are you talking about?
- You got me across the border.

00:56.616 --> 00:59.011
I can get to Paris on my own.
I know where Kate's going.

00:59.941 --> 01:03.531
Martin, you got an address off your kid's
computer, and a hunch he's a terrorist.

01:03.583 --> 01:05.782
Maybe Kate's with him, maybe
she isn't, but the truth is

01:05.882 --> 01:07.315
you don't know what the
hell you're walking into.

01:07.453 --> 01:09.620
All the more reason you
should go home to your family.

01:09.622 --> 01:11.505
Get your life back together.

01:11.541 --> 01:13.924
They'll be plenty of time for that.

01:13.960 --> 01:15.876
- Well, if you get caught...
- I've already aided

01:15.928 --> 01:17.127
and abetted you, Martin.

01:17.129 --> 01:19.346
Too late to back out now.

01:20.295 --> 01:22.349
Look... we gotta stick
to the back roads.

01:22.807 --> 01:25.269
Not as many cameras. Less
chance for Nina to trace us.

01:25.304 --> 01:26.637

Tony Rice entered France 20 minutes ago.

01:39.128 --> 01:40.585
Rice is your guy. This is on you.

01:42.221 --> 01:45.230
(sighing): Okay. Tony had asked
us to pull a kid off a train.

01:45.376 --> 01:47.319
- At Martin's request.
- The kid was clean.

01:47.455 --> 01:48.909
Why go after him?

01:48.961 --> 01:50.878
We must have missed something.

01:50.913 --> 01:53.204
Why else would a guy wanted for capital
murder walk away from protection?

01:53.359 --> 01:55.856
All I care about is bringing them in
before this whole thing goes to hell.

01:57.347 --> 01:58.974
(inhales) Okay, we find Tony...

01:59.009 --> 02:00.087
we find Martin.

02:00.139 --> 02:03.509
Call the French police, tell them to flag
any stolen vehicles between Calais and Paris.

02:03.675 --> 02:06.560
Tony's smart... first thing he's
gonna do is switch up his ride.

you just recently converted.

May I ask how that came about?

03:31.497 --> 03:34.081
I found out my parents
were from Chechnya,

03:34.457 --> 03:37.751
but my Mum kept it secret.

03:37.803 --> 03:40.087

about the new path you've chosen?

03:46.846 --> 03:49.063
I don't really care.

03:49.098 --> 03:51.315
Well, the Holy Quran says

"You should be kind to your parents,

03:54.022 --> 03:56.024
say not a word to them of contempt,

03:56.136 --> 03:57.425
not repel them,

03:57.726 --> 04:00.894

13:04.876 --> 13:06.463
They're prostitutes.

14:10.108 --> 14:11.858
but I found out later that he was a part

14:11.910 --> 14:14.077
of a British operation.

14:14.112 --> 14:15.528
MI6.

14:15.580 --> 14:17.914
Dmitry was one of theirs.

14:20.418 --> 14:21.584
Did you know about this?

14:23.121 --> 14:24.704
He only told me last night.

14:24.756 --> 14:26.623
I'm sorry I couldn't
tell you at the time.

14:26.625 --> 14:28.925
I was following orders.

14:28.960 --> 14:31.628
I know what Dmitry did to you.

14:35.634 --> 14:37.300
(sighs)

14:44.726 --> 14:46.643
So what if he's working for Six?

14:46.645 --> 14:50.540
Doesn't change the fact that he's
a murderer and a drug smuggler,

14:50.705 --> 14:52.179
and he flaunted it!

14:57.973 --> 15:00.250
- What was the operation?
- I don't know.

15:00.388 --> 15:01.908

15:07.449 --> 15:10.430

you, Ballard, is because I thought

15:11.010 --> 15:12.719
it will help you to move on.

15:13.364 --> 15:16.172

- Tony.

looking for this car.

15:43.355 --> 15:44.630
If I turn myself in,

15:44.806 --> 15:47.540

enough for you to hop a train to Paris.

15:47.666 --> 15:49.751
- No.
- Give me your phone.

15:50.279 --> 15:51.247

15:57.319 --> 15:59.453

Listen, this is just
a big misunderstanding.

30:13.594 --> 30:14.843
Okay?

30:15.763 --> 30:17.179
Oh!

30:17.181 --> 30:18.833

Heavenly Father,
please don't punish him,

30:41.205 --> 30:42.921
it wasn't his fault, it was mine.

30:42.957 --> 30:45.090
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

30:45.126 --> 30:46.542

31:13.659 --> 31:15.409
What do you want?

31:18.081 --> 31:21.231
These are the case files from
the Dmitry investigation...

31:21.368 --> 31:23.803
Everything we compiled back in 2001.

31:24.003 --> 31:26.637
Surveillance photos and
logs, arrest reports...

31:26.673 --> 31:28.180
also, Krystof's reports,

31:28.316 --> 31:31.676
and everything else that was
gathered after we were off the case.

31:31.711 --> 31:33.477
I dug them out of storage last night.

31:33.513 --> 31:34.729
It was cold

31:34.764 --> 31:35.980
and smelly down there,

31:36.015 --> 31:37.598
so I hope you appreciate this.

31:39.936 --> 31:42.820
Listen, I'm sorry about yesterday.

31:42.855 --> 31:44.071
I was, um...

31:44.107 --> 31:45.773
A prick?

31:47.443 --> 31:49.076

32:09.549 --> 32:10.715
Now, where's Martin?

32:11.011 --> 32:12.951
The deal we made with
Six to protect him...

32:13.284 --> 32:14.316
That still stand?

32:14.351 --> 32:17.054
Tell me where I can find him,
and I'll do everything I can.

32:17.490 --> 32:19.198
All right, like I said,

32:19.233 --> 32:21.442
Martin thinks this kid
Ifti's gonna martyr himself.

32:21.477 --> 32:23.641
Any idea how, where, when?

32:23.976 --> 32:25.546
All he's got is some address in Paris.

32:25.548 --> 32:27.381
And that's where he's
going... look, Nina,

32:27.383 --> 32:28.908
if Martin's convinced that
something big is gonna happen,

32:28.985 --> 32:30.294
then we are wasting our time here, okay?

32:30.470 --> 32:32.352
- We gotta go help him.
- Tony...

32:33.489 --> 32:34.888
There's no "we."

32:36.192 --> 32:38.225
You know, that's the second time
in the last two days I've heard that.

32:38.375 --> 32:40.111
Maybe you should've
listened the first time.

32:40.563 --> 32:42.613
I'm coming with you. Let's go.

32:42.648 --> 32:44.982
The French police called the FBI

32:45.034 --> 32:47.201
when they checked out your credentials.

32:48.871 --> 32:50.904
They're sending you back to the States.

32:52.999 --> 32:54.405
I'm sorry.

32:58.805 --> 33:00.752
Make sure it wasn't all for nothing.

33:01.083 --> 33:02.749
And I'm sorry if...

33:02.751 --> 33:04.585
if I got you in trouble.

33:06.222 --> 33:08.222
You were always trouble.

33:11.760 --> 33:14.478
Tell me where to find Martin.

You weren't at breakfast again.

34:10.838 --> 34:12.474
I was taking a walk.

34:19.911 --> 34:21.628
I was cruel to you.

34:21.664 --> 34:23.630
I see that now.

34:23.666 --> 34:25.666
I'm sorry.

34:25.668 --> 34:27.333
Please forgive me.

34:27.335 --> 34:29.253
Of course.

34:29.304 --> 34:30.587
(car horn honking)

34:31.679 --> 34:33.757
Talk about it after?

34:33.809 --> 34:36.176
Sure, after.

34:48.190 --> 34:49.906
I'm, uh, I'm looking for Kate Crawford.

34:49.942 --> 34:50.857
Is she here?

34:50.859 --> 34:53.243
Who are you?

34:53.279 --> 34:54.911
Her stepfather.

34:54.947 --> 34:56.530
Kate's not here right now.

34:56.532 --> 34:58.832
Would you like to come in?

35:00.669 --> 35:01.868
Thank you.

35:03.846 --> 35:06.006
I was supposed to meet her,
but she never turned up.

35:06.041 --> 35:08.008
I was, I was worried.

35:08.043 --> 35:10.177
Meet her where?

35:10.212 --> 35:12.512
Is she with, uh, Ifti?

35:12.548 --> 35:14.848
She never mentioned a stepfather.

35:15.336 --> 35:17.634
Look, I've...

35:17.686 --> 35:19.636
I used to be very close to her.

35:19.688 --> 35:21.521
And, uh, I've been away for a long time.

35:21.557 --> 35:23.273
She's very important to me.

35:23.309 --> 35:24.941
Please, if you know where she is...

35:24.977 --> 35:27.311
She's at the protest.

35:27.363 --> 35:29.112
What protest?

35:29.148 --> 35:30.647
At the school.

35:30.699 --> 35:32.866
Well, what's it about?

35:32.901 --> 35:34.507
The anti-Islamic laws

35:34.671 --> 35:36.389
that persecute us for our beliefs.

35:37.072 --> 35:39.072
Do you have a car?

35:39.074 --> 35:40.230
Yes, why?

35:40.394 --> 35:41.936
We need to get to the school now.

35:42.078 --> 35:43.817
- Call the police.
- Yeah, what's going on?!

35:43.955 --> 35:45.225
