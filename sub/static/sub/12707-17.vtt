WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:02.669
What are you doing?

00:02.702 --> 00:04.471
GILES: Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:04.504 --> 00:05.573
PARAMEDIC:
Your mother's dead.

00:05.605 --> 00:07.275
She just wouldn't
believe me.

00:08.742 --> 00:10.310
Oh, god.

00:10.343 --> 00:12.413
I don't think she does.

00:12.445 --> 00:13.881
I'm not real.

00:13.913 --> 00:14.747
You're the key.

00:14.782 --> 00:17.016
Go! Before she finds you.

00:17.050 --> 00:18.219
She's here.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.131
Buffy, you're here.

01:05.432 --> 01:07.501
You all right?
Yeah.

01:08.736 --> 01:10.471
Did you find
something?

01:11.671 --> 01:12.840
This one.

01:14.841 --> 01:16.176
MAN:
It's a fine choice.

01:17.611 --> 01:19.480
It speaks of your
deep feeling for the deceased.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.493
You don't like it?

01:34.527 --> 01:36.430
No. It's not that.

01:37.430 --> 01:38.632
It's just...

01:39.667 --> 01:40.668
what if Mom...

01:42.635 --> 01:44.537
What if she'd like
something else better?

01:46.274 --> 01:48.442
Dawn.
I mean, how do we
know for sure?

01:50.677 --> 01:52.612
She's the one who
has to be in it forever.

01:54.347 --> 01:57.518
Dawn, maybe it wasn't
such a good idea,
you coming along.

01:57.551 --> 01:58.852
It's fine.

02:00.019 --> 02:01.954
It's just...

02:01.989 --> 02:05.692
I'm serious.
You shouldn't have to
deal with this stuff.

02:05.725 --> 02:07.661
If you'd like a few
more minutes to decide--

02:07.694 --> 02:10.330
No. It's done.
It's fine.

02:11.664 --> 02:12.865
Okay?

02:15.068 --> 02:16.236
Okay.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.069
GILES: The prices
of different florists

03:23.103 --> 03:25.573
and funeral homes seems
to be fairly competitive.

03:27.106 --> 03:29.242
Let's just go with that.
It's simpler.
Sure.

03:29.276 --> 03:31.110
What color flowers?

03:32.579 --> 03:36.449
Uh, white.
They're nice.
Yeah.

03:36.484 --> 03:38.451
BUFFY: Uh, what about
an announcement?

03:38.485 --> 03:42.055
People are gonna be expecting
a wake after the burial
unless we say something.

03:42.088 --> 03:44.525
Um, well, we could put
a line in the program

03:44.557 --> 03:46.860
expressing your mother's
preference not to have one.

03:46.894 --> 03:49.562
There's no wake?
Mom didn't like them.

03:51.264 --> 03:54.567
She said that potlucks
are depressing enough
as it is.

03:54.602 --> 03:58.070
She said that? When?

03:58.104 --> 04:00.307
Um, right before
she went in
for the operation.

04:01.474 --> 04:05.513
We had a talk about what
she wanted, in case...

04:06.580 --> 04:09.582
She never said
anything to me.

04:09.616 --> 04:12.319
I'm sure she just didn't
want to upset you, Dawnster.

04:12.353 --> 04:15.288
Now, you better get
workin' on that dinner.
You barely touched it.

04:15.389 --> 04:17.824
You really should
eat something.

04:17.858 --> 04:21.127
Why should I? You're not.

04:21.161 --> 04:24.932
This isn't about--
(phone ringing)

04:24.964 --> 04:27.233
(sighs)
I'm all phoned out.
Will you?

04:27.266 --> 04:29.168
U-Unless
it's my dad.
Of course.

04:29.201 --> 04:30.437
Hello?

04:31.639 --> 04:35.074
Yes. Yes, they did.
Thank you.

04:35.108 --> 04:39.079
Um, the funeral is
at 3:00 tomorrow.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.314
Do you know the
Brown Brothers Mortuary?

04:41.348 --> 04:43.516
I can't believe
he still hasn't called.

04:43.550 --> 04:45.985
Your dad's
still AWOL, huh?

04:46.019 --> 04:48.422
The number he left for us
in Spain is no good,

04:48.456 --> 04:51.324
I've left messages
everywhere.

04:51.358 --> 04:55.127
Um, how 'bout a line that just
says, "Following the burial,
there'll be no wake"

04:55.161 --> 04:57.531
or gathering?

04:57.630 --> 05:00.968
"At the request of Joyce,
there will be no gathering"?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.502
Ugh, that sounds lame.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.708
What are we gonna do?
After, I mean.

05:10.043 --> 05:13.045
Are we just gonna
come back here?

05:13.079 --> 05:16.182
Uh, I don't know.
I guess so.

05:16.216 --> 05:20.019
Um, how about, "At the request
of the family,
there will be no wake."

05:20.052 --> 05:22.221
Good. Yeah. It's got flow.
I don't want to be here.

05:22.254 --> 05:25.091
Where does it go? Do you put it
at the top, or just, like,
a small line at the bottom?

05:29.829 --> 05:33.901
Can I go to
your place tomorrow?
Tomorrow?

05:33.933 --> 05:39.172
After everything?
Um, well, maybe
you and Buffy should--

05:39.206 --> 05:43.877
I-I don't mind.
Can I?

05:43.911 --> 05:47.380
Huh?
Can I go to Willow's
tomorrow after the service?

05:49.716 --> 05:52.985
Uh,
if you want to.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.086
I guess so.

05:56.288 --> 05:58.759
I'll get my sleeping bag
out of the attic.

06:06.266 --> 06:09.769
You goin' home?
I'm gonna stop by
my Mom's first.

06:09.802 --> 06:11.872
Been doing that
a lot lately.

06:11.904 --> 06:14.774
Yeah. I actually might
stop by your Mom's, too.

06:14.807 --> 06:17.745
Well, I'm not
going to my place.
Those people are scary.

06:18.946 --> 06:20.947
XANDER: Speaking of...

06:20.980 --> 06:23.016
You have got to be kidding.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.586
(sighs)
I'm not going in.

06:25.619 --> 06:28.721
And you're not
leaving those.

06:28.755 --> 06:30.790
You actually think
you're gonna score points
with Buffy this way?

06:30.824 --> 06:33.560
This isn't about Buffy.
Bull.

06:34.894 --> 06:37.396
We're all hip to
your doomed obsession.

06:37.430 --> 06:41.569
They're for Joyce.
Like you care
about her.

06:41.601 --> 06:43.937
Guys. Guys,
not here.
(sighs)

06:43.971 --> 06:48.108
Care? Joyce was the only
one of the lot of you
that I could stand.

06:48.141 --> 06:51.711
And she's the only one
with a daughter you wanted
to shag. I'm touched.

06:51.745 --> 06:54.548
I liked the lady.

06:54.581 --> 06:58.050
You understand,
monkey boy?
She was decent.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.653
She didn't
put on airs.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.956
She also had
a nice cuppa for me.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.593
And she never
treated me like a freak.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.430
Her mistake.
(scoffs)

07:10.463 --> 07:14.300
Think what you want.
Unbelievable.

07:16.769 --> 07:21.475
The guy thinks he can put on
a big show and con Buffy
into being his sex monkey.

07:21.509 --> 07:22.709
Xander...

07:24.011 --> 07:25.377
He didn't leave
a card.

08:11.524 --> 08:13.492
PREACHER:
We commend to Almighty God...

08:15.394 --> 08:18.064
our sister, Joyce Summers.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.603
And we commit her body
to the ground.

08:26.606 --> 08:28.175
Earth to Earth...

08:31.077 --> 08:32.913
ashes to ashes...

08:35.582 --> 08:37.951
and dust to dust.

08:43.624 --> 08:46.793
The Lord bless her
and keep her.

08:48.461 --> 08:52.899
The Lord makes his face
to shine upon her
and be gracious to her.

08:55.568 --> 08:59.105
The Lord lift up
his countenance upon her...

08:59.139 --> 09:01.541
and give her peace.

09:12.085 --> 09:15.522
Hey. Um, Dawn's
kind of ready to go.

09:15.554 --> 09:19.525
Can we take her
with us?
Yeah.

09:19.558 --> 09:21.761
She should probably
get out of here.

09:22.995 --> 09:25.164
What about you?
We can wait
if you want.

09:26.899 --> 09:28.769
I'm fine.
Thank you.

10:03.535 --> 10:06.173
I'm sorry.
I couldn't
come sooner.

10:14.313 --> 10:17.951
Oh, Dawn. I wish
I could help more.

10:21.553 --> 10:24.792
The only thing is
it'll get better, I promise.

10:24.825 --> 10:29.028
You don't know that.
Sure she does.

10:29.062 --> 10:32.264
We're witches.
We know stuff.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.566
What?

10:35.668 --> 10:38.571
Life goes on,
and I forget Mom?

10:40.373 --> 10:41.640
Is that what
you're saying?

10:41.674 --> 10:45.544
Not forget. No. You--

10:45.577 --> 10:48.782
You make a place
for her in your heart.

10:48.816 --> 10:51.317
It's sort of like she
becomes a part of you.

10:52.552 --> 10:55.022
Does that make sense?

10:55.054 --> 10:57.356
WILLOW:
Dawn?

10:57.389 --> 11:00.027
Hey, we don't have to
talk about this now.

11:00.059 --> 11:02.162
You could just
go to sleep.

11:02.195 --> 11:05.899
No.
I don't want to sleep.

11:05.932 --> 11:09.235
Okay. We can just
sit or whatever
you want.

11:10.437 --> 11:15.508
Good, because I know
what I want to do now.

11:15.542 --> 11:19.046
Great.
What are you up for?

11:20.047 --> 11:21.881
You guys are witches,

11:21.914 --> 11:26.153
and you do magic
and stuff.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.254
You want us to
teach you something,

11:28.288 --> 11:30.890
Uh, like a glamour?

11:30.923 --> 11:33.927
Or I could make
a stuffed animal dance.

11:33.961 --> 11:36.028
I want to do a spell.

11:37.463 --> 11:39.866
I want to
bring Mom back.

11:50.710 --> 11:55.215
Mmm.
(sighs)

11:55.248 --> 11:57.549
That was different.

11:57.584 --> 12:01.087
Yeah,
it was more intense.

12:01.120 --> 12:04.024
It's because of Joyce.
Right.

12:04.057 --> 12:08.260
Huh?
Well, she got me thinking...

12:08.294 --> 12:11.130
about how people
die all the time,

12:11.163 --> 12:13.700
and how they get born too,

12:13.732 --> 12:17.604
and how you kind of need one
so you can have the other.

12:17.636 --> 12:19.605
When I think
about it that way,

12:19.639 --> 12:21.808
it makes death
a little less sad...

12:23.309 --> 12:24.977
sex a little
more exciting.

12:26.846 --> 12:28.782
Again, I say, huh?

12:28.816 --> 12:32.619
Well, I just think
I understand sex more now.

12:32.652 --> 12:35.956
It's not just about
two bodies smooshing together.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.690
It's about life.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.592
It's about making life.

12:40.626 --> 12:44.063
Right. When two people
are much older

12:44.096 --> 12:46.198
and way richer
and far less stupid.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.971
Breathe.
You're turning colors.

12:52.004 --> 12:53.773
I'm not ready
to make life with you,

12:53.807 --> 12:55.174
but I could.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.177
We could.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.847
Life could come out of
our love and our smooshing,

13:00.880 --> 13:03.316
and that's beautiful.

13:03.350 --> 13:06.418
It all makes me feel
like we're a part
of something bigger,

13:06.452 --> 13:08.822
like I'm more awake
somehow.

13:08.855 --> 13:11.323
You know?

13:11.357 --> 13:13.125
Yeah, I do.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.668
Of course you want to
bring your mother back,

13:22.701 --> 13:26.472
and I wish we could,
but it's not possible.

13:26.505 --> 13:28.841
Why?

13:28.875 --> 13:31.711
You guys do magic
for all kinds of things.

13:31.744 --> 13:35.048
We do, but--
This is different.

13:35.081 --> 13:38.150
Magic can't be used
to alter the natural
order of things.

13:38.184 --> 13:41.855
But all you do is
mess with the natural
order of things.

13:41.889 --> 13:44.024
You make things float
and disappear and--

13:44.057 --> 13:46.393
But we don't mess
with life and death.

13:48.561 --> 13:51.431
Dawn, I know
how bad you hurt.
You don't.

13:54.767 --> 13:57.403
They put her
in the ground.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.538
They did, and it's
awful and unfair,

13:59.572 --> 14:01.573
but this
isn't the way.

14:01.607 --> 14:04.878
WILLOW:
I'm not even sure
it's possible, Dawn.

14:04.912 --> 14:08.414
I mean, I've seen things
on resurrection, but

14:08.447 --> 14:10.116
there's books and stuff.

14:11.618 --> 14:14.988
I guess the spells...
backfire?

14:15.022 --> 14:17.356
That's
not the point.
That's not the point.

14:17.389 --> 14:20.527
The point is
it's bad, because--

14:20.559 --> 14:24.530
Because witches can't be
allowed to alter the fabric
of life for selfish reasons.

14:24.563 --> 14:28.034
Wiccans took an oath
a long time ago
to honor that.

14:28.067 --> 14:32.272
So it's possible...
to bring someone back.

14:32.304 --> 14:35.674
They wouldn't have taken
an oath if they didn't
know they could do it.

14:35.707 --> 14:38.544
Maybe they could,
but we can't.

14:38.577 --> 14:42.349
She's right, Dawn.
It's too dangerous.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.616
You said you wanted
to help me.

14:51.991 --> 14:53.893
Dawn.

15:06.005 --> 15:07.440
BUFFY:
The funeral was...

15:09.241 --> 15:10.809
It was brutal.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.880
But it's tomorrow
that I'm worried about.

15:14.913 --> 15:16.649
What's tomorrow?

15:18.784 --> 15:20.687
That's exactly
what I don't know.

15:22.422 --> 15:25.924
Up until now,
I've had a road map,

15:25.958 --> 15:28.227
things to do
every minute,

15:28.260 --> 15:30.163
having to do
with Mom.

15:31.999 --> 15:34.967
Tomorrow, the stuff
of everyday living resumes.

15:36.970 --> 15:39.072
And everybody expects me
to know how to do it,

15:39.105 --> 15:42.075
because I'm so strong.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.277
You just need
some time.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.346
I'm sure everybody
understands that.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.982
Time's not the issue.

15:52.019 --> 15:54.687
I can stick wood
in vampires...

15:56.655 --> 15:59.125
but Mom was the strong
one in real life.

16:00.860 --> 16:03.663
She always knew how
to make things better,

16:03.696 --> 16:05.865
just what to say.

16:08.835 --> 16:10.437
You'll find your way.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.505
I mean,
not all at once, but...

16:14.673 --> 16:15.975
I don't know.

16:17.809 --> 16:19.412
I keep thinking
about it...

16:20.879 --> 16:23.015
when I found her.

16:23.049 --> 16:26.186
If I had just
gotten there
ten minutes earlier.

16:27.854 --> 16:29.922
You said they told you
it wouldn't have
made a difference.

16:31.591 --> 16:34.193
They said probably

16:34.226 --> 16:36.062
wouldn't have
made a difference.

16:38.065 --> 16:41.701
The exact thing they
said was "probably."

16:43.602 --> 16:45.572
I haven't told that
to anyone.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.639
Doesn't make it
your fault.

16:47.673 --> 16:48.941
Couldn't have done
anything different.

16:50.509 --> 16:53.879
I didn't even start C.P.R.
until they told me.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.548
I fell apart.

16:58.518 --> 17:01.019
That's how good I am
at being a grown-up.

17:03.123 --> 17:04.589
Buffy--

17:04.624 --> 17:08.394
And it'd be okay if it
was just me I had to
worry about...

17:10.063 --> 17:12.231
but Dawn--
Look, it's okay.

17:12.265 --> 17:15.501
You don't feel like
it now, but you
are strong, Buffy.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.237
You're gonna
figure this out,

17:18.404 --> 17:20.307
and you have
people to help you.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.776
You don't have to
do this alone.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.282
It's gonna be
light soon.

17:34.253 --> 17:36.623
I can stay in town
as long as you want me.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.759
How's forever?

17:40.792 --> 17:43.563
Does forever
work for you?

17:48.300 --> 17:50.103
That's a bad idea.

17:52.105 --> 17:55.407
I'm seriously
needy right now.

17:55.442 --> 18:00.346
Let me worry about
the neediness.
I can handle it.

18:35.182 --> 18:36.516
I told you.

18:39.551 --> 18:41.453
You better go.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.794
(exhales)
I'm sorry.
No.

18:50.563 --> 18:53.465
I'm so grateful
that you came, Angel.

18:55.167 --> 18:58.538
I didn't think I was
gonna be able to make it
through the night.

19:02.541 --> 19:05.511
We still have
a few more minutes
until I have to go.

19:08.079 --> 19:09.147
Good.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.657
Good.

19:29.701 --> 19:33.172
Tell my sister I'm
sick of running into
her Jawa rejects.

19:33.205 --> 19:36.075
She bade me come to you.

19:36.107 --> 19:38.478
The news of
your relationship
with the Slayer--

19:38.510 --> 19:40.212
We don't have
a relationship.

19:40.247 --> 19:43.383
But you attempted
to court her,
did you not?

19:43.415 --> 19:45.751
You're more fun
when I hit you.

19:45.785 --> 19:48.186
It's just, Glory would
like to encourage

19:48.221 --> 19:50.390
this interest of yours
in the Slayer.

19:50.423 --> 19:53.192
It might lead to more
information about the key.

19:53.226 --> 19:56.996
And why would I
share that with
"the most unstable one"?

19:57.028 --> 20:00.732
Time is running short, sir.

20:00.767 --> 20:05.672
Every moment you fight Glory,
you're only fighting yourself,
you see?

20:05.704 --> 20:08.173
Fine. Let
the best me win.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.544
Let Glory understand
this: I won't help her
find the key.

20:11.577 --> 20:16.249
I would never do that
to an innocent--
"An innocent"?

20:16.282 --> 20:18.951
The key? That's
an interesting
choice of words.

20:18.984 --> 20:20.920
No. That's not what I--
I understand, sir.

20:20.952 --> 20:22.855
I'm sorry to have
bothered you.
I'll take my leave.

20:22.888 --> 20:25.291
You understand what?
When I said,
it's innocent,

20:25.325 --> 20:27.859
I didn't mean
that the key is--
it's not a person.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.363
Of course not.
You're gonna run
and tell her, aren't you?

20:30.396 --> 20:33.532
Do you understand
what's going to happen
if she finds the key?

20:33.566 --> 20:35.934
How many people
are going to die?
Please. I heard nothing.

20:35.968 --> 20:39.105
I can't
let that happen.
Don't you see?

20:39.137 --> 20:41.207
(grunts)

20:41.240 --> 20:42.409
I can't.

20:46.244 --> 20:48.914
We're heading down
to breakfast.

20:51.651 --> 20:55.086
I'm not hungry.
Oh. Okay.

20:55.121 --> 20:58.290
It's just, we have
class after that,

20:58.325 --> 21:01.728
and I didn't know if
you want to go home or...

21:01.760 --> 21:04.130
I was gonna
sleep some more.

21:04.163 --> 21:06.732
Giles said he'd
pick me up whenever.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.035
WILLOW:
Oh. Okay. Great.

21:10.169 --> 21:12.003
Sure, uh, hang out.

21:12.038 --> 21:16.275
I have a break
around lunchtime.
I can come back.

21:16.308 --> 21:19.010
I might not be here.

21:19.045 --> 21:20.680
Well, I'll try my luck.

21:22.515 --> 21:24.451
Take care, Dawn.

22:02.555 --> 22:05.023
"Age of Levitation.

22:05.057 --> 22:07.527
"War of the Warlocks.

22:10.229 --> 22:13.365
Resurrection:
A Controversy Born."

22:37.690 --> 22:40.527
You don't have to
do that, Dawn.
Just-Just relax.

22:40.559 --> 22:42.729
Yes. Sit down.

22:42.761 --> 22:45.163
We have some very
amusing chicken feet
you can play with.

22:45.197 --> 22:48.667
That's okay.
Don't you watch
television?

22:48.701 --> 22:52.038
I thought all children
despise effort
and enjoy cartoons.

22:53.305 --> 22:55.407
Um, I like being useful.

22:55.442 --> 22:57.076
It keeps my mind
off things.

22:58.778 --> 23:00.413
Then useful
you shall be.

23:00.446 --> 23:02.682
I could always
use a hand.

23:02.714 --> 23:05.617
But you have a hand--
a paid hand.

23:05.652 --> 23:09.489
A hand that isn't the hand
of the illegal child labor.
Anya.

23:11.958 --> 23:14.961
But, of course, it's
wonderful that you
find doing my job

23:14.993 --> 23:17.028
so distracting.

23:17.063 --> 23:19.766
I am unthreatened.
Proceed.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.804
Yes. Carry on, Dawn.

23:24.836 --> 23:26.905
Is there anything
I should know,

23:26.939 --> 23:29.875
like, um, off-limits stuff?

23:29.909 --> 23:34.246
Willow told me that some
of the books and things
are kind of dangerous.

23:34.279 --> 23:36.082
Quite right.

23:36.115 --> 23:39.951
Um, they're all labeled
and kept off the floor.

23:39.986 --> 23:45.057
Most of our more potent
texts and potions
are all up there.

23:45.090 --> 23:48.359
Anyone asks you about
anything in that area,
just come and get me.

23:49.427 --> 23:53.164
Okay.
Anything else?

23:53.199 --> 23:58.003
Um, well, if you like,
I could teach you how to
work the cash register.

23:58.037 --> 24:00.105
You can ring up sales.
Cool.

24:00.138 --> 24:03.174
Ring up sales?
With the money?

24:03.209 --> 24:05.144
She gets to
fondle the money?

24:06.311 --> 24:09.981
(bell tinkles)
Customer!
Hello, customer.

24:10.016 --> 24:11.784
I'll just be a Moment.
ANYA:
I'll help you.

24:11.817 --> 24:13.486
No problem.

25:17.249 --> 25:18.817
Dawn.
Uh-huh.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.820
Wanna come
watch this transaction
that Anya's doing?

25:21.854 --> 25:24.355
Then I'll let you try.
You got it.

25:45.411 --> 25:47.579
I hope it's just
dirt you're after.

25:49.248 --> 25:51.182
Spell calls for anything
more than that,

25:51.217 --> 25:55.121
you're into
zombie territory,
and that's bad news.

25:55.153 --> 25:57.522
Spike, I wasn't--

25:57.556 --> 25:59.726
I know good and well
what you're up to.

25:59.759 --> 26:02.060
That book you've got
is infamous.

26:02.094 --> 26:04.063
Please.
Don't tell Buffy.

26:04.096 --> 26:07.967
I just-- I have to
get her back.

26:09.167 --> 26:10.769
I have to.

26:12.672 --> 26:14.440
I'm not gonna tell,
little bit.

26:17.308 --> 26:19.178
I'm gonna help.

26:24.983 --> 26:26.786
* And you touch
the distant beaches *

26:26.818 --> 26:29.221
* With tales of brave Ulysses

26:29.255 --> 26:31.323
* How his naked ears
were tortured *

26:31.356 --> 26:33.625
* By the sirens
sweetly singing *

26:33.660 --> 26:35.795
* For the sparkling waves
are calling you *

26:35.827 --> 26:38.297
* To kiss
their white laced lips *

26:38.329 --> 26:43.434
(rock music playing)

26:43.469 --> 26:46.271
I've never used this
bloke's services myself,
but there's talk.

26:46.305 --> 26:49.441
Word is he knows
everything there is to know
about resurrection spells.

26:50.541 --> 26:53.179
Come on, now.
No worries.

26:53.211 --> 26:56.648
You don't have to be
all nice to me. I know
why you're doing this.

26:56.682 --> 26:58.549
Do you now?
Enlighten me.

26:59.719 --> 27:01.653
Spike,
I'm not stupid.

27:01.688 --> 27:04.455
You're, like,
stalking my sister.

27:04.490 --> 27:07.794
You'd do anything
to get in good with her.

27:07.826 --> 27:11.497
Buffy never hears
about this, okay?

27:11.529 --> 27:14.599
Found out what I was doing,
she'd drive a redwood
through my chest.

27:14.633 --> 27:18.837
Then, if you
don't want credit,
why are you helping me?

27:18.871 --> 27:23.075
I just don't like to see
Summers women take it so
hard on the chin is all.

27:25.144 --> 27:27.613
And I'm dead serious.
You breathe a word
of this to Buffy,

27:27.645 --> 27:30.115
I'll see to it that you
end up in the ground.

27:30.148 --> 27:32.151
Got it?
Yeah.

27:33.184 --> 27:34.953
Got it.

27:34.987 --> 27:38.356
Where is he? He should
have been back hours ago.

27:38.390 --> 27:40.392
I'm sure Jinx
is on his way,

27:40.425 --> 27:43.061
your new and improvedness.

27:43.095 --> 27:48.166
He's most loyal to--
Hey! He better be loyal.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.201
Jinxy?

27:50.236 --> 27:52.371
Oh, no, no!

27:52.403 --> 27:55.040
Mind the rug, honeys.
Blood's a bitch.

27:55.074 --> 27:57.710
Was this the Slayer?
I'll pull her wings off!

27:57.743 --> 27:59.644
(panting)
It was Ben.

27:59.677 --> 28:00.946
Ben?

28:03.048 --> 28:05.317
Ben? Oh, god!

28:05.351 --> 28:07.519
You pointless,
stupid lump!

28:07.553 --> 28:10.388
Oh, I hate you.
I hate you. I hate you!

28:10.422 --> 28:14.492
The key.
He told me.
(grunts)

28:14.526 --> 28:18.596
The key?
What about the key?

28:18.630 --> 28:21.901
He indicated that
it was a person,

28:21.933 --> 28:25.938
most... highest you.

28:27.773 --> 28:29.776
The key's in human form?

28:29.808 --> 28:33.412
I believe so...
good one.

28:33.444 --> 28:35.748
(gasps)

28:35.781 --> 28:41.019
Ahh! Jinx,
you robed stud.
You're my man!

28:41.052 --> 28:43.255
I'm even gonna
let you slide on
the lame toadying,

28:43.288 --> 28:45.191
on account of your
dying and stuff.

28:45.223 --> 28:50.429
Ah, so, the key's
all secreted away

28:50.461 --> 28:53.365
in a flesh wrapper,
huh?

28:53.398 --> 28:55.867
This narrows the search
from now on in a serious way.

28:55.902 --> 28:59.771
I mean, we didn't have a clue.
It could have been a log
or a bicycle pump

28:59.806 --> 29:02.708
or whatever. Am I right?
(sighs)

29:02.740 --> 29:05.743
Oh. Get him fixed,
would ya?

29:05.778 --> 29:08.146
I want to hear
the whole story again

29:08.180 --> 29:10.648
without all that
annoying moaning.

29:10.682 --> 29:12.919
(mewing)

29:18.757 --> 29:21.093
This place belongs
to a magic guy?

29:22.428 --> 29:24.596
It smells like Grandpa.
Hey!

29:25.964 --> 29:27.799
Anybody home?

29:33.204 --> 29:35.673
I know you.
Don't think so, mate.

29:35.707 --> 29:37.409
No, no. You're that guy.

29:37.442 --> 29:40.679
That guy hangs round
down at the corner mart.

29:40.711 --> 29:43.648
Big into dominos,
aren't you?
Can't say as I am.

29:43.682 --> 29:45.817
Look, we came here
because--
(chuckles)

29:45.852 --> 29:48.119
That's crazy, isn't it?
I mean,

29:48.153 --> 29:51.323
I-I'd swear
you were that guy.

29:51.356 --> 29:54.259
I mean, your hair's
a different color,
and you're a vampire,

29:54.292 --> 29:55.994
but o-other than that--

29:57.063 --> 29:58.529
Maybe we should just go?

29:58.564 --> 30:01.532
No. Now, just because
the lights are dim,

30:01.567 --> 30:03.869
Doesn't mean
the juice is all gone.

30:03.903 --> 30:06.505
What can I do for you?

30:06.538 --> 30:09.474
This one's mum
kicked it a few days back.

30:09.508 --> 30:11.809
Oh. I'm so sorry.

30:13.244 --> 30:15.814
We were wondering
what's to be done about it.

30:15.847 --> 30:18.349
Heard you were
the one to ask.

30:18.384 --> 30:22.820
Oh. No.
No, that's, uh--

30:22.855 --> 30:24.355
You don't wanna
mess with that.

30:25.423 --> 30:27.558
I know some tonics.

30:27.593 --> 30:29.694
You know, make
the grieving fly by.

30:29.728 --> 30:32.364
I don't want any tonics.

30:32.397 --> 30:34.700
Either one of you
witches?

30:34.732 --> 30:38.336
Got any experience
with spells
of this magnitude?

30:43.209 --> 30:44.710
Didn't think so.

30:44.742 --> 30:46.244
Ow!

30:50.249 --> 30:53.384
Uh, your mother's a good
candidate, at least.
Strong D.N.A.

30:53.419 --> 30:54.953
Right.

30:59.258 --> 31:02.961
(humming)

31:15.473 --> 31:19.045
(humming continues)

31:30.288 --> 31:32.391
I've gathered
some ingredients,

31:32.423 --> 31:35.594
but the spell
I found...

31:35.626 --> 31:38.263
there's things in it
I don't understand.

31:38.297 --> 31:41.099
We've got the Ghora demon
standing between you
and success.

31:41.133 --> 31:43.269
That's the translation
you were missing.

31:44.769 --> 31:46.738
Ghora. I've heard of those.
They local?

31:46.771 --> 31:49.942
Yeah, they like to stick close
to the Hellmouth.

31:51.277 --> 31:55.780
Egg of the Ghora gives life.
It's key to the spell.

31:55.814 --> 31:59.651
Can you buy it?
This egg, or--

31:59.684 --> 32:02.989
If it was as easy
as making an omelet,
everyone would try it.

32:03.021 --> 32:05.923
No. You have to steal
the egg

32:05.958 --> 32:07.593
from the nest of the demon.

32:09.028 --> 32:10.962
And the Ghora
won't be happy about it.

32:10.997 --> 32:13.398
Where do we find
this demon?

32:13.432 --> 32:16.634
First things first.
We'll need an image
of your mother.

32:16.667 --> 32:19.971
A photo, a painting.
No problem.

32:20.006 --> 32:21.839
Once you get
all the ingredients together,

32:21.873 --> 32:25.644
put them in the center
of a sacred circle

32:25.676 --> 32:27.813
with the photo
of your mother.

32:27.846 --> 32:30.148
Then...

32:30.182 --> 32:33.951
say this incantation
three times.

32:35.186 --> 32:38.324
She won't appear,
you know, poof.

32:38.356 --> 32:40.526
It'll take a while,

32:40.558 --> 32:41.859
but she will come to you.

32:43.561 --> 32:44.630
Got it?

32:46.698 --> 32:49.768
Got it.
Oh. Anything goes wrong,

32:49.800 --> 32:52.003
the only way
to reverse the spell...

32:52.038 --> 32:54.339
is to destroy the image
of your mother, understand?

32:54.373 --> 32:56.775
I'll do it right.

32:56.807 --> 32:58.710
It's a tricky spell, girl.

32:58.743 --> 33:02.381
I can't say for sure
your mother will come back
exactly like she was.

33:03.981 --> 33:08.153
Sometimes these things
get a little off.

33:08.186 --> 33:13.358
But she'll still
be my mother. Won't she?

33:13.392 --> 33:15.227
More or less.

33:18.430 --> 33:21.400
Good. Good.

33:24.769 --> 33:26.837
And the Ghora?

33:26.872 --> 33:29.740
Oh, right. Sorry. Um,

33:29.775 --> 33:33.511
go in the sewer entrance
near Tracy Street.

33:33.545 --> 33:36.515
The opening's
on the left.

33:36.548 --> 33:38.616
Can't miss it.
Just follow that down.

33:41.252 --> 33:44.256
No, no.
Keep your money.

33:46.424 --> 33:49.760
Oh... Thank you.

33:53.464 --> 33:55.767
You just
keep in touch now.

33:55.800 --> 33:57.603
Let me know how it goes.

33:59.070 --> 34:00.939
(low growl)

34:04.710 --> 34:06.711
I-I will.

34:19.157 --> 34:23.128
It's here.
Just like he said.

34:23.161 --> 34:25.764
So, at least we know
the old coot isn't
completely daft.

34:25.797 --> 34:29.201
Look, you'd
better let me snatch
this egg thing on my own.

34:29.235 --> 34:31.936
No way. I'm going.

34:31.969 --> 34:34.106
No. You are not.

34:34.139 --> 34:36.242
I've got no idea
what's down there.

34:36.275 --> 34:38.277
You need me, Spike.

34:38.309 --> 34:40.646
Somebody's got to get
the egg while you
distract the Ghora.

34:40.679 --> 34:42.114
Now, come on.

34:44.483 --> 34:46.585
(sighs)
Well, what do you know?

34:46.617 --> 34:48.085
Bitty Buffy.

34:51.422 --> 34:55.092
(snoring)

34:59.498 --> 35:00.931
Doesn't look so bad.

35:00.965 --> 35:03.469
Wait 'til it wakes up.

35:03.501 --> 35:05.804
That's usually
when the bad starts.

35:07.472 --> 35:11.510
I can't get to the eggs
unless it moves. No way.

35:11.543 --> 35:14.313
I'll make it move.
You just be ready.

35:15.547 --> 35:17.949
Hey! Ghora!
Heads up.

35:17.983 --> 35:19.851
(growls)

35:22.019 --> 35:23.722
Right. Heads it is.

35:27.326 --> 35:29.460
Over here, trip-tip.
That's the best you got?

35:32.231 --> 35:34.132
Dawn! Hey,
get away from her.

35:40.706 --> 35:42.440
Ha! Missed me.
Spike, come on!

35:42.474 --> 35:44.510
C'mon, bastard!
(shrieking)

35:50.548 --> 35:52.784
Leave it, Dawn.
I can't. Mom.

35:52.818 --> 35:56.521
It's too dangerous,
and I haven't got--
a weapon!

36:00.090 --> 36:03.195
(screams)
Dawn! Hey, get away
from her.

36:05.664 --> 36:08.567
Hey! Leave her be!
(shrieking)

36:08.599 --> 36:10.335
Ha! Missed me.
(grunts)

36:16.342 --> 36:18.909
(yells)

36:20.911 --> 36:22.947
Come on, bastard!

36:31.956 --> 36:34.059
Spike!
(shrieking)

36:36.628 --> 36:40.365
Sorry!
Did you get it?
Don't be sorry then.

36:44.469 --> 36:48.440
Osiris,
giver of darkness...

36:50.074 --> 36:53.978
taker of life,
god of gods...

36:55.146 --> 36:57.282
accept my offering.

36:59.150 --> 37:02.653
Bone, flesh, breath...

37:04.155 --> 37:08.427
yours, eternally.

37:08.460 --> 37:13.130
Bone, flesh, breath...

37:15.900 --> 37:20.338
I beg of you,
return to me.

37:32.617 --> 37:36.322
What did I have for
breakfast this morning?
Do you remember?

37:36.355 --> 37:38.556
Huh?
I want to say bagel,

37:38.590 --> 37:41.226
but I think
that was yesterday.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.494
You had two eggs,
sunny-side up.

37:43.528 --> 37:45.797
I remember because
they were wiggling at me

37:45.831 --> 37:46.965
like little boobs.

37:48.132 --> 37:49.367
Sassy eggs.

37:50.835 --> 37:52.903
Wil, what are you writing
this for?

37:52.938 --> 37:54.373
My journal.

37:57.443 --> 37:59.244
That's new.

37:59.277 --> 38:03.481
Yeah, I figured
life goes by
so fast.

38:03.514 --> 38:07.184
If you don't
write stuff down,
it just gets lost.

38:07.217 --> 38:09.420
And I wanna
remember.

38:09.454 --> 38:11.322
Down to every last bagel.

38:12.623 --> 38:15.527
Down to every
last everything
I do with you.

38:20.030 --> 38:21.132
Huh.

38:22.233 --> 38:23.702
What?

38:23.735 --> 38:25.302
What happened
to History of Witchcraft?

38:26.505 --> 38:29.340
I-- uh,
it isn't there?

38:32.710 --> 38:34.512
Dawn must have taken it.

38:34.545 --> 38:36.213
No, she didn't.
Did she?

38:38.083 --> 38:40.018
This is bad.
This is really bad.

38:40.050 --> 38:42.353
But it's just
a history book.

38:42.387 --> 38:44.856
It might answer
some of her questions.

38:44.889 --> 38:48.159
I don't think
she could do any harm
with that stuff, could she?

38:48.193 --> 38:50.862
Well, it's not
a "how to" guide, but
it refers to specific

38:50.896 --> 38:52.831
resurrection spells
and potions.

38:52.864 --> 38:57.202
But I didn't-- I mean--
Hey! How'd she know that?

38:57.235 --> 38:59.704
I don't know, but--
God, what else
did she take?

38:59.737 --> 39:02.373
Nothing...
I-I think.

39:02.407 --> 39:05.476
I think she took
nothing else.

39:05.510 --> 39:07.545
But maybe she did,

39:07.579 --> 39:12.851
and we should probably look,
because who knows? I don't.

39:12.884 --> 39:15.253
No, no. We can't
waste time on that now.

39:15.286 --> 39:17.088
We don't know
what she's up to.

39:17.121 --> 39:20.826
We have to call Buffy. Now.

39:20.858 --> 39:23.260
(phone ringing)

39:26.197 --> 39:28.032
Hello?

39:28.065 --> 39:32.603
Bone, flesh, breath...
yours, eternally.

39:32.637 --> 39:36.106
Bone, flesh, breath.

39:36.141 --> 39:39.577
I beg of you,
return to me.

39:39.610 --> 39:42.246
(thunder rumbling)
Dawn...

39:42.280 --> 39:44.882
What have you done?

39:44.916 --> 39:47.018
What have you done?

39:47.052 --> 39:49.588
She's coming.
She's coming home.

39:55.460 --> 39:58.195
Dawn! Dawn!

39:58.228 --> 40:00.264
You have no idea
what you're messing with!

40:00.297 --> 40:02.233
Who knows what you
actually raised?

40:02.266 --> 40:04.603
What's gonna come
through that door?
No, I know.

40:04.635 --> 40:06.804
It'll be her.
No.

40:06.838 --> 40:10.141
Tara told me that
these spells
go bad all the time.

40:10.175 --> 40:12.376
People come back wrong.

40:12.409 --> 40:14.646
She won't.
He told me her D.N.A.--

40:14.679 --> 40:18.717
Who told you?
Who helped you?
Nobody! Let me go!

40:18.750 --> 40:21.853
You have to stop it.
Reverse it!
No!

40:23.021 --> 40:25.389
Dawn, you know
this is wrong.

40:25.422 --> 40:28.594
You know you can't
let this happen.
Not to Mom.

40:28.626 --> 40:30.094
But I need her.

40:31.429 --> 40:32.998
I don't care if she--

40:36.001 --> 40:39.436
I'm not like you, Buffy.
I don't have anybody.

40:39.471 --> 40:44.342
What? Of course you do.
You have me.

40:44.375 --> 40:48.614
No, I don't.
You won't
even look at me.

40:48.646 --> 40:51.282
It's so obvious
you don't want me
around.

40:51.315 --> 40:53.284
That's not true.

40:53.318 --> 40:55.186
Yes, it is.

40:58.155 --> 41:02.960
Mom died, and it's like
you don't even care.

41:05.163 --> 41:08.365
Of course I care.

41:08.398 --> 41:10.268
How can you even think that?

41:10.300 --> 41:11.402
How can I not?

41:13.003 --> 41:16.708
You haven't even cried.
You've just been
running around

41:16.742 --> 41:18.976
like it's been
some big chore
or something.

41:20.411 --> 41:22.380
Cleaning up
after Mom's mess.

41:22.413 --> 41:26.617
(cries out, crying)

41:26.652 --> 41:30.188
Oh, my god.
Dawn,

41:30.221 --> 41:33.157
I've been working.

41:34.693 --> 41:37.829
I've been busy
because I have to--

41:37.862 --> 41:40.331
No! You've been
avoiding me.

41:40.364 --> 41:41.666
I'm not!

41:43.869 --> 41:47.873
I have to do
these things, 'cause--

41:49.541 --> 41:54.378
'Cause when I stop,
then she's really gone.

41:55.947 --> 41:59.250
And I'm trying.
Dawn, I am--

41:59.284 --> 42:03.054
I am really trying
to take care of things,

42:03.088 --> 42:06.592
but I don't even know
what I'm doing.

42:06.625 --> 42:08.559
Mom always knew.

42:09.628 --> 42:11.929
Nobody's asking you
to be Mom.

42:11.963 --> 42:14.666
Well, who's gonna be
if I'm not?

42:14.699 --> 42:18.202
Huh, Dawn? Have you even
thought about that?

42:19.237 --> 42:22.206
Who's gonna
make things better?

42:22.239 --> 42:26.376
Who's gonna take care of us?

42:26.411 --> 42:31.382
Buffy--
I didn't mean to push
you away. I didn't.

42:31.416 --> 42:34.985
I just--
I couldn't let you see me--

42:37.155 --> 42:38.389
Oh, god, Dawnie.

42:38.422 --> 42:41.726
I don't know
what we're gonna do.

42:42.927 --> 42:45.130
I'm scared.
Buffy--

42:46.496 --> 42:48.465
(knocking)

42:49.467 --> 42:50.467
Mommy?

42:53.304 --> 42:55.273
Buffy--

42:55.306 --> 42:56.907
Mom.

43:21.632 --> 43:22.768
Dawn.

43:26.271 --> 43:29.273
It's okay.
(sobbing)

43:37.648 --> 43:39.951
It's okay.

43:39.985 --> 43:42.152
(sobbing)

44:25.096 --> 44:26.597
Grr! Arrgh!
