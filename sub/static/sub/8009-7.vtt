St. Barts is so
beautiful.

00:11.999 --> 00:14.999
- I've always wanted to come here.
- Look how pretty it is.

00:14.999 --> 00:16.999
- This is beautiful!
- It's our first

00:16.999 --> 00:19.999
all-girls trip.
Kylie's on her way.

00:19.999 --> 00:21.999
Where's Kylie's room?
I'm really excited to, like, do

00:21.999 --> 00:24.999
weird, random, adventurous
things together.

00:24.999 --> 00:27.999
- Aah!
- You know Tyga's coming?

00:27.999 --> 00:31.999
He's, like, joining the family
vacay.

00:31.999 --> 00:33.999
Well, that's a
little annoying.

00:33.999 --> 00:35.999
I thought this was gonna be an
all-girls trip.

00:35.999 --> 00:40.999
- Yay!
- Want to come, T?

00:40.999 --> 00:43.999
At this point, I can't do
anything about Kylie inviting

00:43.999 --> 00:47.999
- Tyga on the trip.
- I just found this

00:47.999 --> 00:49.999
- girl's Instagram.
- So Scott's with two

00:49.999 --> 00:51.999
- girls?
- People keep telling

00:51.999 --> 00:55.999
me all this information I don't
even want to know, but then, you

00:55.999 --> 00:58.999
know, it's like how can you not
look?

00:58.999 --> 01:00.999
- Who's that chick?
- I don't know.

01:00.999 --> 01:04.999
- We've been investigating.
- Once you start

01:04.999 --> 01:06.999
cyberstalking someone,
constantly checking someone's

01:06.999 --> 01:12.999
- page, it becomes so unhealthy.
- This guy.

Come on, you little
pieces of.

01:23.999 --> 01:27.999

Oh.

Are you really

01:39.999 --> 01:41.999
thinking you're gonna hit
something that way?

01:41.999 --> 01:43.999
I'm gonna get these
suckers if it's the last thing I

01:43.999 --> 01:45.999
do.
I've never had so many bites on

01:45.999 --> 01:48.999

- Uh, yeah, me, too.

01:48.999 --> 01:52.999

- Mermaid?

02:24.999 --> 02:27.999

- What?

02:27.999 --> 02:29.999
- She's not here yet.
- P, is that true?

They have, like, a real
mermaid that comes and swims in

02:32.999 --> 02:34.999
- the pool with them.
- How fun.

02:34.999 --> 02:37.999
You know there's not
such a thing as a real mermaid,

02:37.999 --> 02:39.999
- right?
- It's a girl that, like,

02:39.999 --> 02:42.999
obviously has a tail and, like,
probably shells and, like...

02:42.999 --> 02:44.999
There actually are
real mermaids.

02:44.999 --> 02:47.999
- There's real mermaids?
- Why would people,

02:47.999 --> 02:52.999
like, think that there are?
They've obviously seen them.

02:52.999 --> 02:55.999
Are you delirious?
Do you think there's real

02:55.999 --> 02:58.999
- mermaids?
- Maybe once upon a time.

02:58.999 --> 03:00.999
No, they're still
there.

03:00.999 --> 03:02.999
Do you know how big the ocean

You think there's real
mermaids swimming around out

- There obviously

03:06.999 --> 03:09.999
are.
I'm just feeling kind of ugly.

I need to start exercises on my
stomach.

I want to get that Pilates
Cadillac.

Wait, you want to
know something interesting?

I didn't hear from Scott once
from Wednesday to Sunday, and

03:44.999 --> 03:48.999
then he wrote me yesterday.
Supposedly, I think he was

03:48.999 --> 03:51.999
landing in Mexico last night at,
like, 11:00 p.m.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.999
- Where did he go?
- To Joe's.

03:53.999 --> 03:55.999
- What?
- Yes, and Joe kept

03:55.999 --> 04:01.999
saying, "No, you can come alone.
You cannot come with girls."

04:01.999 --> 04:05.999
As much as Kourt wants
to act like this is so easy for

04:05.999 --> 04:09.999
her to hear that Scott is
hanging out with random chicks,

04:09.999 --> 04:13.999
Kourtney is great at pushing
down her feelings.

04:13.999 --> 04:16.999
But I know it gets under
anyone's skin.

04:16.999 --> 04:18.999
- How could it not?
- Joe said,

04:18.999 --> 04:20.999
"Apparently he's staying in a
hotel.

04:20.999 --> 04:22.999
I hope this is a wakeup call for
him.

04:22.999 --> 04:25.999
We have a room ready for him and
him alone."

04:25.999 --> 04:27.999
I wrote him yesterday.
He won't even write me back.

Well, who cares?
Don't write him anymore.

your toes a little, bend your

Kylie for 30 minutes to do the
fly thing, and...

06:07.999 --> 06:09.999
- What happened?
- She just, like, took

06:09.999 --> 06:14.999
too long with T.
And we couldn't do it, which is

06:14.999 --> 06:17.999
so annoying.

06:19.999 --> 06:22.999
It's kind of annoying, 'cause I
was really looking forward to

06:22.999 --> 06:25.999
being with Kylie on this trip.
And it's not even about Tyga.

she'll kind of be taken away

swam?

keep an open mind.

07:17.999 --> 07:20.999
Would be kind of cool if you
ever went on a date.

07:20.999 --> 07:24.999
I am, like, not a
dating person.

07:24.999 --> 07:27.999
I did the dating thing before
Scott for, like, a minute, and

07:27.999 --> 07:32.999
it was so not for me.
I just got out of a nine-year

07:32.999 --> 07:35.999
relationship.
I think the last thing I

07:35.999 --> 07:38.999
probably need is anybody in my
life.

07:38.999 --> 07:41.999
Do you see yourself
with somebody else at some point

07:41.999 --> 07:43.999
- one day?
- I don't know.

07:43.999 --> 07:45.999
- I'm not, like...
- I mean, in your mind,

07:45.999 --> 07:48.999
do you think, "I can't wait to
meet the one"?

07:48.999 --> 07:50.999
- Not really.
- Do you think the one is

07:50.999 --> 07:55.999
- Scott?
- I don't know.

07:55.999 --> 07:58.999
- I did.
- I really, really care

07:58.999 --> 08:02.999
for Scott, so it's definitely
heartbreaking for me to see

08:02.999 --> 08:06.999
everything crumble.
He's the father of my

08:06.999 --> 08:10.999
grandchildren, and it's
inevitable that Kourtney and

08:10.999 --> 08:13.999
Scott will be in each other's
lives forever.

08:13.999 --> 08:16.999
So I want him to be strong and
to get better.

08:16.999 --> 08:19.999
And I think that it would be
nice if they had a fresh start.

08:19.999 --> 08:25.999
Well, as long as you keep your
heart open, even just this much,

08:25.999 --> 08:28.999
just a crack, just leave a
little tiny crack open in the

08:28.999 --> 08:33.999
- door.
- There's this

08:33.999 --> 08:36.999
photographer, and I want to set
him up with Kourt.

08:36.999 --> 08:39.999
I just don't think Kourtney
realizes how bomb she is right

08:39.999 --> 08:41.999
- now.
- She is just, like, on

08:41.999 --> 08:44.999
- and poppin' right now.
- It might be a really

08:44.999 --> 08:47.000
good idea if you'd spend a
little bit of time with Kendall

08:47.000 --> 08:49.999
on this trip.
Just for a minute.

08:49.999 --> 08:52.999

annoying.

I haven't seen Scott since

09:24.999 --> 09:27.999
Maybe we could even swim with
her, too, and go night swimming.

- Oh, on my way to jail,

10:41.999 --> 10:43.999
- Kim's taking selfies of herself.
- I know, it's the

10:43.999 --> 10:45.999
best thing and Mom goes, "Kim,
stop taking pictures..."

"Kim, your sister's going to

10:47.999 --> 10:49.999

Pass me my computer.

10:49.999 --> 10:50.999

When I was in jail, Kim came in
with her baby pink camera and

11:04.999 --> 11:06.999
was videotaping me.
Kim was laughing and she's like,

11:06.999 --> 11:08.999
"Are you with people?"
And I was like, "23 other

11:08.999 --> 11:11.999
girls."
She was like, "What? Okay."

11:11.999 --> 11:14.999

gets how, like, hot she is.

The revenge body-- as I know--
is the best body.

11:21.999 --> 11:23.999
She can Instagram a good
pic.

11:23.999 --> 11:25.999
- Or do a selfie book.
- Totally.

11:25.999 --> 11:28.999
She should do her
new... she should take over your

11:28.999 --> 11:31.999
- selfie book.
- Yes.

11:31.999 --> 11:34.999
Um, so there's this
photographer on the island

11:34.999 --> 11:38.999
that's really good.
He's shot a lot of people and I

11:38.999 --> 11:41.999
- want to set him up with Kourt.
- Like, set him up,

11:41.999 --> 11:42.999
- like...
- No, like, to shoot

11:42.999 --> 11:44.999
- her.
- We're all here and we

11:44.999 --> 11:47.999
should just kind of try to
distract Kourtney and just do

11:47.999 --> 11:49.999
what we can to get her mind off
of everything.

11:49.999 --> 11:52.999
I think if she just did a photo
shoot it would make her feel

11:52.999 --> 11:54.999
good, it could boost up, you
know, her self-esteem a little

11:54.999 --> 11:56.999
bit.
I just want her to live in the

11:56.999 --> 11:59.999
moment and, you know, take this
trip for herself.

11:59.999 --> 12:01.999
- So you know this guy?
- I know of him.

12:01.999 --> 12:04.999
I just don't think Kourtney
realizes how bomb she is right

12:04.999 --> 12:05.999
- now.
- I agree.

12:05.999 --> 12:08.999
And I think a photo
shoot will help her realize.

12:08.999 --> 12:11.999
I just want to make her feel
good, she deserves it.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.999

- Tell me about it.

13:43.999 --> 13:45.999
I mean, yeah, you just
got to have patience, 'cause,

13:45.999 --> 13:48.999

mind made up how she wants

13:48.999 --> 13:51.999

You can tell her, but it can go,

- Yeah.

"Screw you, like, no, that's not

14:05.999 --> 14:06.999
right."
She'll talk to you,

to you about it.

T. here?

wanted to hang out with me.

I guess I have been a little

15:16.999 --> 15:20.999

Kendall because I'm just

15:20.999 --> 15:23.999

little neglected.

15:54.999 --> 15:59.000

be honest.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.999

23:15.999 --> 23:18.999
- Seaweed.
- No, I'm literally

23:18.999 --> 23:20.999
gonna throw up.
I love being around my family.

23:20.999 --> 23:24.999
I think family is forever, and
family will be there longer than

23:24.999 --> 23:27.999
- your friends will be there.
- T, you see them?

23:27.999 --> 23:29.999
- Yes. Yeah, I see them.
- My sisters are,

23:29.999 --> 23:31.999
- like, my best friends.
- Damn, that sea

23:31.999 --> 23:33.999
- urchin's big.
- It's really nice to

23:33.999 --> 23:36.999
kind of always have someone to
lean on and be able to hang out

23:36.999 --> 23:38.999
- with.
- Sea urchins are so

23:38.999 --> 23:41.999
- scary.
- They, like, pass away.

23:41.999 --> 23:46.999
All right,
let's walk over here.

23:46.999 --> 23:48.999
- I see you jigglin'.
- Really?

23:48.999 --> 23:52.999
Yeah.
That booty jigglin'.

23:52.999 --> 24:09.999
Greatest hike ever.♪ ♪

24:09.999 --> 24:11.999
Look how beautiful it
is out here.

24:11.999 --> 24:14.999
Mm-hmm. It's so
pretty.

24:14.999 --> 24:16.999
I'll sit on this side so
I can watch them.

24:16.999 --> 24:19.999
When Mason and I
went on the jet ski, he pushed

24:19.999 --> 24:23.000
the thing, like, as fast as it
could go.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.999
When we were going, he was like,
so happy.

24:26.999 --> 24:28.999
Has he ever been one in
Mexico?

24:28.999 --> 24:30.999
Yeah, he goes with
Scott on them, on the jet ski.

24:30.999 --> 24:33.999
- Oh.
- No, that's North's.

24:33.999 --> 24:35.999
Mason, give that to North,
please.

24:35.999 --> 24:39.999
People send me a

24:39.999 --> 24:42.999
photo and say, "Look at this."
Scott has started posting things

24:42.999 --> 24:45.999
like this.
Like, it's almost like he wanted

24:45.999 --> 24:48.999
- me to look at his Instagram.
- But why would he want

24:48.999 --> 24:50.999
- that, like, negativity?
- I just find it

24:50.999 --> 24:53.999
funny, 'cause they're all
posting it on purpose, like, to

24:53.999 --> 24:55.999
be like, you know?
I just want everyone to stop

24:55.999 --> 25:01.000
bothering me with, like,
information, unless it's, like,

25:01.000 --> 25:02.999
an emergency.

25:06.999 --> 25:09.999
You know, it's so hard
seeing my children on a trip.

25:09.999 --> 25:12.999
that was the first trip that
I've never been on with my own

25:12.999 --> 25:15.000
- kids.
- You say, "Oh, I don't

25:15.000 --> 25:17.999
have a family," and then we give
you one.

25:17.999 --> 25:19.999
Why do you, like, destroy it?

25:28.999 --> 25:30.999
I just find it
funny, 'cause they're all

25:30.999 --> 25:33.999
posting it on purpose, like, to
be like, you know?

25:33.999 --> 25:37.999
I just want everyone to stop
bothering me with, like,

25:37.999 --> 25:41.999
information, unless it's, like,
an emergency.

25:41.999 --> 25:43.999
Should I just write him
and go, "What the hell is going

25:43.999 --> 25:45.999
on?"
No.

25:45.999 --> 25:49.999
We are on vacation having the
time of our lives.

25:49.999 --> 25:52.999
- I need some water.
- Ladies, there's the

25:52.999 --> 25:54.999
- kids' food for you.
- Ooh, your food is

25:54.999 --> 25:56.999
here. Yum.

25:56.999 --> 25:58.999
- What kind of ice cream is that?
- Coconut.

25:58.999 --> 26:01.999
That's really tart.
Too crazy. Hi.

26:01.999 --> 26:03.999
- Hi.
- Um, I've just been

26:03.999 --> 26:05.999
sitting here for 20 minutes,
and, uh, I find you very

26:05.999 --> 26:08.999
- beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

26:08.999 --> 26:10.999
- What's your name?
- I'm Rodolfo.

26:10.999 --> 26:12.999
- Rodolfo? Oh.
- Yes.

26:12.999 --> 26:14.999
This is Kourtney
Kardashian.

26:14.999 --> 26:15.999
Hi. Nice to meet
you.

26:15.999 --> 26:17.999
Sorry to interrupt
like this.

26:17.999 --> 26:19.999
If you're gonna say
that, you can interrupt any

26:19.999 --> 26:21.999
- time.
- Well, you know.

26:21.999 --> 26:25.999
I could help you out on surfing
and diving or snorkeling.

26:25.999 --> 26:27.999
You wanted to take surf
lessons with Mason.

26:27.999 --> 26:30.999
I don't want to
take surf lessons, but I want

26:30.999 --> 26:33.999
- him to take surf lessons.
- Yeah, well, maybe he

26:33.999 --> 26:35.999
- could help out with that.
- Yeah, definitely.

26:35.999 --> 26:37.999
- Coinkydink.
- I wish you a good

26:37.999 --> 26:39.999
- evening, so...
- Thank you.

26:39.999 --> 26:41.999
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

26:41.999 --> 26:43.999
Is this, like, a
set-up thing?

26:43.999 --> 26:45.999
No. You're beautiful.
Why would you think that?

26:45.999 --> 26:47.999
No, I'm serious.

26:47.999 --> 26:48.999
That was cute that that
guy came up, though.

26:48.999 --> 26:51.999
I know, but, like,
then what he... what does anyone

26:51.999 --> 26:53.999
- say, or what do you do?
- Nothing.

26:53.999 --> 26:56.999
I'm hanging out
with my family, and I just want

26:56.999 --> 26:59.999
to have some fun.
I've been really busy with

26:59.999 --> 27:02.999
everything going on in my life.
I'm just not into going on

27:02.999 --> 27:04.999
- dates.
- I think at some point,

27:04.999 --> 27:16.999
you just have to follow your
heart.

27:16.999 --> 27:18.999
Super fast, go up and
down, up and down.

27:18.999 --> 27:20.999
It's too slow.

27:20.999 --> 27:22.999
- What?!
- Mom!

27:22.999 --> 27:23.999
- Yeah! Arms straight.
- Are you doing it?

27:23.999 --> 27:25.999
Arms straight.
You can follow the direction of

27:25.999 --> 27:27.999
your arm.
You know, when you...

27:27.999 --> 27:29.999
- What you guys doing?
- Water aerobics.

27:29.999 --> 27:31.999
- Bike.
- I want to try.

27:31.999 --> 27:33.999
He wants to come
in.

27:33.999 --> 27:34.999
Give us one hour,
kids.

27:34.999 --> 27:38.999
Mommy has to be
healthy and strong.

27:38.999 --> 27:41.999
Kourtney, put your
back into it, woman.

27:41.999 --> 27:43.999
- In front of me.
- I am.

27:43.999 --> 27:45.999
- My bike is, like, lopsided.
- Okay.

27:45.999 --> 27:49.999
This is
actually really hard.

27:49.999 --> 27:52.999
Make a splash behind
you.

27:52.999 --> 27:55.999
My whole ass has

27:55.999 --> 27:57.999
- ridden up my butt.
- Faster! Faster!

27:57.999 --> 28:00.999
Kourt, you're my
motivation for this.

28:00.999 --> 28:02.999
- Okay, stop.
- Your butt is my

28:02.999 --> 28:04.999
- motivation.
- Oh.

28:04.999 --> 28:06.999
Listen, Kourtney can't

28:06.999 --> 28:09.999
- be the only hot girl here.
- Kourtney has three kids.

28:09.999 --> 28:11.999
She's never looked better.
She's, like, the hottest mom

28:11.999 --> 28:14.999
ever.
But she's, like, so been out of

28:14.999 --> 28:17.999
the dating game for so long that
she doesn't even realize it.

28:17.999 --> 28:19.999
Kourtney, I want to see
your chest getting out of the

28:19.999 --> 28:21.999
- water.
- I mean, it's gonna take

28:21.999 --> 28:23.999
time, you know?
But I'm really proud that

28:23.999 --> 28:26.999
Kourtney is taking these steps
to get her life back.

28:26.999 --> 28:28.999
You're a hot, sexy
MILF.

28:28.999 --> 28:31.000
I don't know what's going on
with Scott, but he's not the

28:31.000 --> 28:34.999
only guy around.
Kourt, when you look that hot,

28:34.999 --> 28:44.999
you're gonna rise to the top,
girl.

28:44.999 --> 28:46.999
You guys ready to go
home?

28:46.999 --> 28:48.999
We're going home!
Yeah!

28:48.999 --> 28:50.999
I'm glad you came with
us, Tyga.

28:50.999 --> 28:52.999
- I had a good time.
- Did you?

28:52.999 --> 28:54.999
- I'm glad you were here.
- It's my first time in

28:54.999 --> 28:57.999
- St. Barts, too.
- Really? You had a lot

28:57.999 --> 29:01.999
of firsts on this trip.
We've had a really drama-filled

29:01.999 --> 29:03.999
year.
Good trip.

29:03.999 --> 29:07.999
So it's been really great to
have a little break.

29:07.999 --> 29:10.999
I'm just hoping that this is the
start of a new beginning.

29:10.999 --> 29:12.999
You ready to rock
and roll?

29:12.999 --> 29:17.999
I had so much fun on this trip.
I had all the kids, got to hang

29:17.999 --> 29:21.000
- out with my sisters and my mom.
- Thank you so much!

29:21.000 --> 29:23.999
- It was wonderful!
- I just think I

29:23.999 --> 29:27.999
- needed to get out of town.
- Au revoir.

29:27.999 --> 29:29.999
Ugh!

29:29.999 --> 29:31.999
Where'd he go?

29:31.999 --> 29:33.999
- Right there.
- It's right there.

29:33.999 --> 29:35.999
- It's right there.
- On mirror, mirror,

29:35.999 --> 29:36.999
- mirror, mirror.
- It's on her head.

29:36.999 --> 29:38.999
- It's on mom's head.
- Kylie, no, don't do

29:38.999 --> 29:40.999
- it like that. You got to like...
- I'm scared.

29:40.999 --> 29:42.999
I'm scared. It's right there.
It's right there.

29:42.999 --> 29:44.999
What is it?
Take your purse.

29:44.999 --> 29:46.999
Right there.

29:46.999 --> 29:48.999
- I...
- It's in your hand!

29:48.999 --> 29:50.999
You got it. You got it.

29:50.999 --> 29:52.999
I love these family
trips.

29:52.999 --> 29:56.999
I think being away so much kind
of makes you appreciate hanging

29:56.999 --> 29:59.999
out with your family a lot more.

30:20.999 --> 30:23.999
Sent a mass text.
I was like, "Can you believe

30:23.999 --> 30:25.999
Stanley's closed?"
I remember you were in

30:25.999 --> 30:27.999
- with your dad.
- Hey, ladies.

30:27.999 --> 30:29.999
You were sitting in a
corner, and I said, "God, I

30:29.999 --> 30:31.999
didn't know he had a daughter."
Yeah.

30:31.999 --> 30:33.999
Kim's gonna eat,
because she's pregnant, while

30:33.999 --> 30:35.999
- we're doing the meeting.
- Hi.

30:35.999 --> 30:37.000
- Hi.
- This is Kourtney and

30:37.000 --> 30:38.999
- Khloe. This is Greg.
- Haven't seen you guys

30:38.999 --> 30:40.999
- forever.
- Mom, stop.

30:40.999 --> 30:42.999
- Are you joking? Hi. How are you?
- Good to see you.

30:42.999 --> 30:44.999
- Hi, Kourt.
- Hi.

30:44.999 --> 30:46.999
Kim and I were talking
when were realized we were gonna

30:46.999 --> 30:49.999
go to lunch one day, all of us,
and we heard Stanley's was

30:49.999 --> 30:53.999
closed, and first, we were mad.
We were like, "We couldn't get a

30:53.999 --> 30:56.999
warning to have one last Amy's
salad and the Chinese chicken

30:56.999 --> 30:59.999
salad and all of our favorites."
And then we all started thinking

30:59.999 --> 31:02.999
about all the things we were
gonna be missing in our life.

31:02.999 --> 31:06.999
And Kim and I said, "Well, wait
a minute.

31:06.999 --> 31:09.999
Calabasas has no great
restaurants."

31:09.999 --> 31:12.999
And so, we're obviously very
interested.

31:12.999 --> 31:14.999
What does it mean to get into
the restaurant business

31:14.999 --> 31:16.999
- together?
- It has to be a fun,

31:16.999 --> 31:18.999
- like, clubhouse for you guys.
- Should we call this

31:18.999 --> 31:20.999
Dash Diner?
Dine and Dash?

31:20.999 --> 31:23.999
- Dine and Dash.
- It's sort of cute.

31:23.999 --> 31:28.999
We could do Kris's
pasta primavera and Kris's rice

31:28.999 --> 31:33.999
pilaf.
Maybe Kris's swordfish.

31:33.999 --> 31:35.999
None of those things
sound like I want them in my

31:35.999 --> 31:37.999
restaurant.
You need to, like, maybe pump

31:37.999 --> 31:42.999
- the brakes a tad.
- I get excited.

31:42.999 --> 31:48.999
Hey, Scott!

31:48.999 --> 31:51.999
Hi!
I'm... shocked.

31:51.999 --> 31:57.999
I haven't seen Scott since
months ago.

31:57.999 --> 32:00.000
So, I'm surprised to see him.

32:02.999 --> 32:06.999
It's just
been a really hard time, going

32:06.999 --> 32:11.999
from, like, having all of you
guys to having nobody, you know?

32:11.999 --> 32:14.999
It breaks my
heart to see her in pain, and

32:14.999 --> 32:26.999
all that we ever wanted for you
guys was to be happy.

32:26.999 --> 32:29.999
Thank you so much.
All right, I'll walk you out.

32:29.999 --> 32:32.999
- Scott, good seeing you.
- Hey, you, too.

32:32.999 --> 32:34.999
Take care.
I was just coming to say hi to

32:34.999 --> 32:36.999
your mom.
I didn't know...

32:36.999 --> 32:37.999
- Hi.
- ...every person in the

32:37.999 --> 32:39.999
- world was here.
- I knew that my mom

32:39.999 --> 32:43.999
and Scott have been trying to
have a conversation.

32:43.999 --> 32:46.999
- Look at you.
- But I had no idea

32:46.999 --> 32:50.999
that today is when they were
going to be talking.

32:50.999 --> 32:52.999
I'm just a little bit caught
off-guard.

32:52.999 --> 32:54.999
It just makes me a little bit
anxious.

32:54.999 --> 32:56.999
- Where are you guys talking?
- I mean, I feel like I

32:56.999 --> 32:58.999
- haven't spoke to anybody...
- Oh, okay.

32:58.999 --> 33:00.999
...in three months,
so...

33:00.999 --> 33:02.999
So why don't you go get
your sisters?

33:02.999 --> 33:04.999
So why don't you
talk to them?

33:04.999 --> 33:06.999
- But with me or without?
- With you.

33:06.999 --> 33:08.999
All right, let's go in
here.

33:08.999 --> 33:10.999
Khlo, will you come
down?

33:10.999 --> 33:12.999
- Yeah, coming.
- Scott wanted to

33:12.999 --> 33:16.999
- talk to you.
- Oh! Finally!

33:16.999 --> 33:18.999
Khloe just said to
me that she hasn't talked to you

33:18.999 --> 33:20.999
- in a long time.
- I haven't talked to

33:20.999 --> 33:24.999
- anybody in a long time.
- Kim!

33:24.999 --> 33:26.999
Oh, he's talking to
everyone?

33:26.999 --> 33:28.999
- It's, like, serious?
- I mean, I don't know.

33:28.999 --> 33:29.999
- I just feel like...
- Hi.

33:29.999 --> 33:31.999
- Hi.
- Are you gonna wear

33:31.999 --> 33:33.999
- your glasses for this meeting?
- Well, yeah.

33:33.999 --> 33:35.999
- Mmm.
- Just because, you

33:35.999 --> 33:37.999
- know...
- Are you gonna cry?

33:37.999 --> 33:38.999
I don't know, uh, I
don't think you need to make fun

33:38.999 --> 33:40.999
- of me, I mean...
- No, I was totally

33:40.999 --> 33:42.999
- kidding.
- I'm in a pretty

33:42.999 --> 33:46.999
awesome place in my life, and
it's been really easy.

33:46.999 --> 33:50.999
You know, it's so hard seeing my
children on a trip.

33:50.999 --> 33:52.999
That was the first trip that
I've never been on with my own

33:52.999 --> 33:54.999
kids.
I was so jealous and scared that

33:54.999 --> 33:57.999
I chartered a plane and brought
a bunch of people to Mexico that

33:57.999 --> 34:01.999
I didn't even know.
Just to, like, make myself feel

34:01.999 --> 34:04.999
better, and all it's done is
make myself feel worse.

34:04.999 --> 34:08.999
You know, you guys were the only
people I ever had, so being an

34:08.999 --> 34:12.999
only child and then not even
having parents, it's, like, it's

34:12.999 --> 34:16.999
very scary.
Dealing with this by myself has

34:16.999 --> 34:18.999
- not been, like...
- Yeah, but you act like

34:18.999 --> 34:20.999
- we made that choice.
- Listen...

34:20.999 --> 34:22.999
Like, you made that
choice, so don't put that on our

34:22.999 --> 34:24.999
- shoulders.
- I'm not putting it on

34:24.999 --> 34:26.999
- anybody's shoulders.
- You just did by saying

34:26.999 --> 34:27.999
that though.
Like, that... like, you're not

34:27.999 --> 34:29.999
- gonna shift blame.
- I'm not shifting

34:29.999 --> 34:31.999
blame, I realize I'm in the
wrong, and I've been in the

34:31.999 --> 34:35.999
wrong a long time.
Trust me, if you didn't have one

34:35.999 --> 34:39.999
person alive in your family when
you went through your divorce

34:39.999 --> 34:42.999
with Lamar, you wouldn't be
doing all that well.

34:42.999 --> 34:44.999
I'm sure.
It was the hardest thing.

34:44.999 --> 34:46.999
Like, you guys are
super, super lucky that you have

34:46.999 --> 34:48.999
- each other.
- Yeah.

34:48.999 --> 34:50.999
And I'm not here to,
like, make excuses and justify

34:50.999 --> 34:53.999
and try to get anybody to be on
my side.

34:53.999 --> 34:55.999
Right, but also that
"woe is me" thing, it's like, we

34:55.999 --> 34:57.999
were "woe is you," we were
trying to help you and be there

34:57.999 --> 34:59.999
for you and sympathize with you.
And we still love you and want

34:59.999 --> 35:01.999
to do that.
But for you to say, "This has

35:01.999 --> 35:04.999
been tough for me to go
through," we never wanted you to

35:04.999 --> 35:06.999
go through this.
We always wanted to be there

35:06.999 --> 35:07.999
- with you.
- I agree with you...

35:07.999 --> 35:09.999
You know, I'm really
glad that Khloe's here 'cause

35:09.999 --> 35:12.999
she always speaks her mind.
I think she's saying all the

35:12.999 --> 35:16.999
things that Kourtney wishes she
could say, and that makes me

35:16.999 --> 35:19.999
just really happy that Khloe can
really stand up for Kourtney.

35:19.999 --> 35:23.999
It's just sad,
because, you know, I considered

35:23.999 --> 35:27.999
everybody in this house, like...
my sister, my mom...

35:27.999 --> 35:29.999
You know what I mean?
And it's just like...

35:29.999 --> 35:31.999
It's not like, "Oh,
Scott's gone, it's so easy."

35:31.999 --> 35:33.999
- Like, no. It's...
- Well, I mean, I'm

35:33.999 --> 35:34.999
happy to hear that, obviously,
in my mind.

35:34.999 --> 35:37.999
'Cause of my insecurities, I
feel like everyone's just, like,

35:37.999 --> 35:40.999
leaning on each other, like, no
big deal, let's move on, Scott's

35:40.999 --> 35:42.999
out of here, let's move to the
next one.

35:42.999 --> 35:46.999
You know, it was weird for me to
lose not just her, but, like,

35:46.999 --> 35:49.999
- everybody else I knew, you know?
- This is the stuff that

35:49.999 --> 35:52.999
I don't understand.
You say, "Oh, I don't have a

35:52.999 --> 35:55.999
family and I don't have all
these things."

35:55.999 --> 36:12.999
And then we give you one.
Why do you, like, destroy it?

36:12.999 --> 36:15.999
This is the stuff
that I don't understand.

36:15.999 --> 36:20.000
You say, "Oh, I don't have a
family and I don't have all

36:20.000 --> 36:22.999
these things."
And then we give you one.

36:22.999 --> 36:28.999
- Why do you, like, destroy it?
- I'm sure you guys have

36:28.999 --> 36:31.999
heard a lot of horrible things
about me that I should've just

36:31.999 --> 36:34.999
been honest with, but I was too
ashamed that I was gonna hurt

36:34.999 --> 36:37.999
everybody in this family and
not just her, and I've

36:37.999 --> 36:41.999
apologized to Kourtney 100
times, but I've never apologized

36:41.999 --> 36:43.999
to, like, all of you, for
letting all of you down and

36:43.999 --> 36:47.999
embarrassing you guys and...
I understand I need to help

36:47.999 --> 36:51.999
myself way before I can help her
or my kids or whatever.

36:51.999 --> 36:56.999
But it's just been a really
hard time... going from, like,

36:56.999 --> 37:01.000
having all of you guys to having
nobody, you know?

37:01.000 --> 37:02.999
It's like...

37:05.999 --> 37:08.999
But I'm, like, living in a house
by myself.

37:08.999 --> 37:10.999
You know, I want to pick up the
phone and call my mom and dad

37:10.999 --> 37:14.999
and be like, "Tell me how the
hell, on your side, to, like,

37:14.999 --> 37:17.999
figure this out.
What... should I go somewhere?

37:17.999 --> 37:21.999
Should I do something?"
It's just not as easy as you

37:21.999 --> 37:24.999
think when you have addiction
issues and, like, I'm just so

37:24.999 --> 37:29.999
ashamed that, like, I publicly
embarrassed all of you.

37:29.999 --> 37:33.999
You guys really did so much for
me for so many years and it's

37:33.999 --> 37:37.000
just...
It kills me to the point that I

37:37.000 --> 37:40.999
feel like I can't make it up.

37:40.999 --> 37:43.999
People are human and
they make mistakes.

37:43.999 --> 37:45.999
We've all been through enough
that I don't think

37:45.999 --> 37:49.999
anybody sitting here today is
worried about the perception of

37:49.999 --> 37:52.999
being embarrassed.
And I never want you to feel

37:52.999 --> 37:55.999
abandoned.
I mean, I can't imagine what

37:55.999 --> 38:00.999
that feels like, but I never
want you to feel that way.

38:00.999 --> 38:04.999
But when you are on this
downward spiral, we want to

38:04.999 --> 38:06.999
make...
It's like, I was very

38:06.999 --> 38:09.999
conflicted, because I want to
make sure you're okay, too.

38:09.999 --> 38:11.999
You're the father of my
grandchildren.

38:11.999 --> 38:13.999
- No, I know.
- We love you.

38:13.999 --> 38:16.999
I... the love... you just don't
turn love off like a switch.

38:16.999 --> 38:20.999
I didn't want
everybody to just think that I

38:20.999 --> 38:23.999
had no care in the world and I
just floated around town and did

38:23.999 --> 38:25.999
whatever I wanted to do.

38:27.999 --> 38:29.999
You know how many times I've
wanted to come over and sit with

38:29.999 --> 38:34.999
you and just explain and go
through all the reasons of how I

38:34.999 --> 38:37.999
got here?
I've never been this unhappy in

38:37.999 --> 38:43.999
my life, you know?
It's like...

38:43.999 --> 38:47.999
It's just terrible to, like...
I don't, like...

38:47.999 --> 38:52.999
If I didn't have those kids, I
would kill myself.

38:52.999 --> 38:56.999
But I have them and I'm gonna be
here and I'm gonna make it right

38:56.999 --> 39:02.999
for them, you know?
You know, I just... I just hope

39:02.999 --> 39:06.999
that somehow, like, you know,
I'm... not that I'm religious,

39:06.999 --> 39:11.999
but God can, like, give me a
chance or us a chance at this or

39:11.999 --> 39:14.999
something.
Because, like, I just know I'll

39:14.999 --> 39:18.000
never have the happiness that I
would have otherwise and, you

39:18.000 --> 39:21.999
know, it's been nice having you
guys in my life for so long,

39:21.999 --> 39:25.999
so...
It's weird to lose that many

39:25.999 --> 39:30.999
- people that quick, you know?
- We all love you very

39:30.999 --> 39:34.999
much.
And you can say that, you

39:34.999 --> 39:37.999
know...
It breaks my heart to see her in

39:37.999 --> 39:39.999
- pain.
- Me, too.

39:39.999 --> 39:42.999
It-It's one of the
hardest things you can go

39:42.999 --> 39:45.999
through, as a mom, to see you
kid, you know, struggling.

39:45.999 --> 39:49.999
And all that we ever wanted for
you guys was to be happy.

39:49.999 --> 39:53.999
But you have to make the
decision that what you want is

39:53.999 --> 40:00.999
to be a partner and a dad and
involved and present and

40:00.999 --> 40:05.999
committed and you fight for what
you want and you need and you

40:05.999 --> 40:09.999
- love and you show somebody.
- If you and Kourt are

40:09.999 --> 40:11.999
together or not, like, I still
care about you and I want the

40:11.999 --> 40:13.999
- best for you.
- We all do.

40:13.999 --> 40:16.999
And what you did was
up, but I appreciate you

40:16.999 --> 40:20.999
saying something, 'cause I was
really disappointed in you.

40:20.999 --> 40:23.999
I think what Kourtney wants to
see most out of you is action.

40:23.999 --> 40:26.999
She might not be as vulnerable
and to say it as I am, but

40:26.999 --> 40:31.999
Kourtney wants to see that you
have faith in your own self.

40:31.999 --> 40:35.999
So she could believe in you that
much stronger.

40:35.999 --> 40:38.999
But I don't think it's
also healthy for Kourtney-- and

40:38.999 --> 40:41.999
I think she knows this-- to
spend so much energy always

40:41.999 --> 40:44.999
helping you, when all you do is,
like,  on her.

40:44.999 --> 40:46.999
- Agreed.
- So I think that's why

40:46.999 --> 40:47.999
- she...
- And I want someone

40:47.999 --> 40:51.999
- who also helps me.
- I want to help you.

40:51.999 --> 40:53.999
Not just that I'm
helping.

40:53.999 --> 40:55.999
I agree.
You need somebody that you could

40:55.999 --> 40:58.999
- stand on.
- I think Scott

40:58.999 --> 41:04.999
always means it when he says
that he wants to make a change.

41:04.999 --> 41:10.999
I just think he really doesn't
know how to get there.

41:10.999 --> 41:12.999
I want to be able to
be the man that you've always

41:12.999 --> 41:15.000
wanted.
I could party, I could go out

41:15.000 --> 41:16.999
every night, I could do
whatever.

41:16.999 --> 41:18.999
That's not the life I really
want.

41:18.999 --> 41:24.999
I-I know what I want and I may
not get it, but I know that I

41:24.999 --> 41:26.999
would literally hate myself for
the rest of my life if I didn't

41:26.999 --> 41:30.999
at least try.
And I realize that if I don't

41:30.999 --> 41:33.999
make a change now, like, it'll
never be able to be okay.

41:33.999 --> 41:37.999
And it may not be, but I'm damn
well gonna try and I just wanted

41:37.999 --> 41:40.999
you guys to know that and I
wanted to see you guys and...

41:40.999 --> 41:44.999
I just love you all and miss you
guys so much, you know?

41:44.999 --> 41:51.999
- We love you, too.
- We love you, too.

41:51.999 --> 41:53.999
I'm sure everybody has
things to do, so I'll let you

41:53.999 --> 41:56.999
guys do what you got, but thank
you.

42:18.999 --> 42:20.999
On the next episode...
It's so exciting that it's New

42:20.999 --> 42:22.999
York Fashion Week.
Kylie's gonna be at Kanye's

42:22.999 --> 42:24.999
- show.
- I'm leaving.

42:24.999 --> 42:26.999
Kylie, that's
up.

42:26.999 --> 42:28.999
- I'll find you later.
- I've heard from a couple

42:28.999 --> 42:30.999
- people that...
- What?

42:30.999 --> 42:33.999
- You're scaring me.
- It's really good that

42:33.999 --> 42:35.999
you're going to the app
announcement for the girls.

42:35.999 --> 42:38.999
Why is it for the
girls and not for me?

42:38.999 --> 42:41.999
It's gonna look bad,
like, "It just wasn't ready."

42:41.999 --> 42:43.999
I just had a baby
when we were working on it.

42:43.999 --> 42:46.999
No. You're not special.
