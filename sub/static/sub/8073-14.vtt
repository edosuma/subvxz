Hey.

00:11.379 --> 00:12.746
I know you thought
your allowance

00:12.780 --> 00:14.248
wasn't going to get
us through this month,

00:14.282 --> 00:17.118
but I brought dinner.

00:17.151 --> 00:20.588
It's amazing how well you
can eat off loose change.

00:20.621 --> 00:21.489
Wow.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.757
Ding Dongs and Ho-Hos.

00:23.791 --> 00:28.662
We better use the floral toilet
paper tonight for napkins.

00:28.696 --> 00:29.630
Well, I'm sorry.

00:29.663 --> 00:31.932
The steak button was stuck.

00:31.965 --> 00:34.535
I'm just in a really
crappy mood right now.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.804
I just talked to my mom, and
I had to lie to her again.

00:36.837 --> 00:39.740
I'm just getting so sick of it.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.075
I know what you're saying.

00:41.109 --> 00:42.776
You don't want me here.

00:42.810 --> 00:45.413
Yes, David, that's exactly
what I'm saying, word for word.

00:45.446 --> 00:47.948
Thank you for listening.

00:47.981 --> 00:49.950
Well, you don't act
like you want me here.

00:49.983 --> 00:51.252
You're always in a bad mood.

00:51.285 --> 00:53.087
I'm beginning to feel
like I'm in the way.

00:53.121 --> 00:54.388
You're not in
the way, all right?

00:54.422 --> 00:56.624
I couldn't possibly be more
thrilled that you're here

00:56.657 --> 00:58.559
all day long, no
matter what time it is,

00:58.592 --> 00:59.927
doing absolutely nothing.

00:59.960 --> 01:00.761
I love that.

01:03.997 --> 01:06.734
You know, I get in bad
moods, too, but I hold back.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.035
This is me holding back.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.637
If I wasn't holding back,
the better part of your face

01:09.670 --> 01:11.105
would be under my
fingernails by now.

01:13.941 --> 01:16.177
You know, the only reason
that I don't do anything

01:16.210 --> 01:18.446
is because you're never
around to do it with.

01:18.479 --> 01:20.214
Oh, I'm sorry I
have a life, David.

01:20.248 --> 01:21.415
I'm sorry I have friends.

01:21.449 --> 01:23.784
I'm sorry I'm not a pathetic
zombie like you are.

01:23.817 --> 01:27.321
Well, I do not
accept your apology.

01:27.355 --> 01:30.124
This whole living
together thing just sucks.

01:30.158 --> 01:31.692
I'm not eating that
garbage another night.

01:31.725 --> 01:32.726
I'm going out.

01:32.760 --> 01:33.627
Fine!

01:33.661 --> 01:34.662
Go!

01:34.695 --> 01:36.197

Excuse me!

02:41.662 --> 02:43.130
Is Mark here?

02:43.163 --> 02:45.132
He's taking a nap!

02:45.165 --> 02:49.136
[music shuts off]

02:49.169 --> 02:51.905
I'm Dan Conner,
Mark's father-in-law.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.746
Hey, [chuckles] you know,
when I was a bachelor,

02:58.779 --> 03:00.981
I had quite the
sound system myself.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.717
Quadraphonic, reel-to-reel.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.953
What kind of system
do you have now?

03:05.986 --> 03:07.888
Clock radio.

03:07.921 --> 03:11.292
It's a nice one, got two alarms.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.227
So how's Mark been doing
the last couple of days?

03:13.261 --> 03:14.127
Why?

03:14.161 --> 03:15.296
What happened?

03:15.329 --> 03:17.565
He left his wife.

03:17.598 --> 03:21.835
Oh, well, that's probably
why he moved in here.

03:21.869 --> 03:25.506
My guess is you and Mark
used to study together.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.908
Mark left his wife?

03:27.941 --> 03:31.912
That's got to, I
don't know, suck.

03:31.945 --> 03:33.847
Well, they've been
together quite a while,

03:33.881 --> 03:37.585
and I can't imagine him
being too happy living here.

03:37.618 --> 03:40.554
Whoa, whoa.

03:40.588 --> 03:41.389
Great TV.

03:45.259 --> 03:47.795
I didn't know there
was a game on.

03:47.828 --> 03:48.762
I got a satellite dish.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.564
There's always a game on.

03:50.598 --> 03:51.399
Oh, man.

03:54.067 --> 03:57.405
So-- so you think Mark's in
a lot of pain or something?

03:57.438 --> 03:59.206
Well, the man hasn't
seen his wife in two days.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.441
My guess is he's
going through hell.

04:06.179 --> 04:07.681
You've got a refrigerator
in the living room?

04:10.751 --> 04:12.353
That's brilliant.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.054
You want something?

04:14.087 --> 04:14.888
Can I get it myself?

04:21.228 --> 04:22.296
Hey.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.432
Hey.

04:24.465 --> 04:25.833
What are you doing here?

04:25.866 --> 04:28.336
Uh, I thought we
should talk about Becky.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.737
[scoffs] Forget it.

04:29.770 --> 04:33.307
Look, Mark, I know these
problems seem huge at first,

04:33.341 --> 04:35.543
but if you just call her.

04:35.576 --> 04:39.313
I mean, Roseanne and I
have had plenty of fights.

04:39.347 --> 04:43.384
I remember this one fight we had
when I wanted a satellite dish.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.886
Yeah, we said
everything already.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.721
Not good enough.

04:47.755 --> 04:49.222
My daughter is hurting here.

04:49.256 --> 04:51.359
Did she send you
down to talk to me?

04:51.392 --> 04:53.126
No, this was my idea.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.695
Then I've got
nothing to say to her.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.897
Come on, Mark,
forget the pride thing.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.666
Just come home and see Becky.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.067
Look, Becky doesn't
want to see me, Dan.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.602
I flunked out of trade school.

05:01.635 --> 05:04.605
She's not thinking
about that right now!

05:04.638 --> 05:07.375
She's been miserable for the
last two days without you.

05:07.408 --> 05:08.476
No she hasn't.

05:08.509 --> 05:12.045
She's hurting every
bit as bad as you are.

Two remotes?

05:14.181 --> 05:16.249
Cool.

05:16.283 --> 05:18.386
Look, I'm not
coming back, Dan.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.621
Besides, I know Mrs. Conner's
real glad that I'm gone.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.823
She's probably waiting with a
shotgun in case I come back.

05:22.856 --> 05:26.326

thing isn't loaded.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.127

Come on, Roseanne.

06:02.229 --> 06:04.665
That kind of thing isn't
easy for a guy like Mark.

06:04.698 --> 06:09.169
Well, he could get somebody
to dial a phone for him.

Hi, Dad.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.772
Hey, Beck.

So, Becky, do you
want some donuts?

06:13.507 --> 06:15.275
I got tons of 'em.

06:15.308 --> 06:17.010
This car hit the blood
mobile, and there

06:17.044 --> 06:17.978
were donuts everywhere.

It was-- it was just awful.

I got all kinds of it.

06:22.182 --> 06:24.918
I got the chocolate twisty kind,
the lemon squirty kind, and

06:24.952 --> 06:25.986
the ones that look like feet.

06:26.019 --> 06:27.655
No.

06:27.688 --> 06:30.724
I got half a
plain one over here.

06:30.758 --> 06:32.793
OK.

06:32.826 --> 06:33.694
Thanks, Dad.

06:33.727 --> 06:34.662
Cheer up, honey.

06:41.569 --> 06:44.404
You suck!

donuts against me.

06:50.277 --> 06:52.079
What am I supposed to do?

06:52.112 --> 06:53.947
She's hurting because
her husband is gone.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.415
Well, if you really
want to be a good dad,

06:55.449 --> 06:57.317
why don't you tell her how lucky
she is that that creep walked

06:57.350 --> 06:58.652
out on her now instead
of years from now

06:58.686 --> 07:00.621
when she's got a ton of
his creepy little kids.

07:00.654 --> 07:01.889
I don't want to be a good dad.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.324
I want to be a popular dad.

07:04.357 --> 07:06.860
Hi, guys.

07:06.894 --> 07:09.096
Is Roseanne doing any better?
- A little.

07:09.129 --> 07:11.632
She's out of her coma now
and can understand words.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.369
Yeah, she's doing
a little better.

07:16.403 --> 07:17.370
I'm fine.

Dan's the one that
should feel lousy.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.273
It's all his fault.

07:20.307 --> 07:22.676
How is this my fault?

07:22.710 --> 07:26.446
Because Mark is a butt head.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.448
And girls always
marry their fathers.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.521
You know, from talking
to Mark it didn't

07:33.554 --> 07:36.289
sound like it was my
fault. He's afraid to come

07:36.323 --> 07:37.525
home because of you.

them how stupid that was?

07:42.362 --> 07:44.598
Did you defend me?

I was there to listen.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.168
I think Mark has a point.

07:48.201 --> 07:49.703
You weren't very nice to him.
- What are you talking about?

07:49.737 --> 07:50.838
I was a total saint.

You made constant fun of
him, called him names,

07:53.140 --> 07:55.408
put him down, hid his keys.

07:55.442 --> 07:58.111
Once I hid his keys,
and that was a joke.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.914
He never found them!

08:00.948 --> 08:04.217
Well, you laughed.

You're not the bad guy.

takes it out on me then?

Well, this may just be
a stab in the dark, Roy,

09:30.904 --> 09:34.908

you're not married.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.777
Yeah, how'd you know?

Well, because when I
was younger and single,

09:39.112 --> 09:42.816
every single guy I dated that
didn't live at home lived here.

09:42.850 --> 09:45.953
As a matter of fact, I think
this is Dan's old couch.

You wanna sit down?

09:48.355 --> 09:49.823
Yeah, thanks.

09:49.857 --> 09:53.226
Is there some place that I
could, uh, boil this first?

09:53.260 --> 09:54.561
That's just beer.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.631
It's got to be dry by now.

You want something to drink?

back me up on that.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.361
She seems pretty cool to me.

11:01.394 --> 11:02.295
Roy, get out of here!

11:07.434 --> 11:09.970
You're going to have
to go and talk to Becky.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.505
Look, I already told Mr.
Conner I can't do that.

11:12.539 --> 11:14.207
Well, you're going to have to.

11:14.241 --> 11:15.542
Because she's going
to have to know that

11:15.575 --> 11:17.477
you left because of you
and not because of me.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.213
You know, this whole
thing is your fault.

11:20.247 --> 11:21.048
Yeah, I know.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.685
Well, so what do
you mean by that?

11:25.719 --> 11:26.854
You were right about me.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.421
I screwed everything up.

11:28.455 --> 11:29.356
Yeah.

11:29.389 --> 11:30.457
Yeah, you did.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.159
And you shouldn't
have taken our money

11:32.192 --> 11:33.827
to go to school when you
weren't prepared to go

11:33.861 --> 11:34.828
all the way through with it.

11:34.862 --> 11:36.463
What do you want me to say?

11:36.496 --> 11:39.066
I know the school thing
wasn't right for me.

11:39.099 --> 11:40.467
I mean, I'm not
a real smart guy.

11:44.037 --> 11:48.408
Well, if you say so, Mark.

11:48.441 --> 11:51.478
I fix cars, bikes,
things like that.

11:51.511 --> 11:52.980
I'm not like Becky.

11:53.013 --> 11:55.015
She's the one that should
be going to school here.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.583
Well, then so why did you go?

11:56.616 --> 11:57.517
Because she made me.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.819
It was all her idea.

11:58.852 --> 12:01.721
I just want to get a job
and take care of Becky.

12:01.755 --> 12:05.125
But I didn't even have
the brains to do that.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.427
God, would you stop
calling yourself stupid?

12:07.460 --> 12:11.765
I mean, you're going to
wreck it for everybody else.

12:11.799 --> 12:13.934
I'm just trying to be honest.

12:13.967 --> 12:17.905
Becky deserves someone
other than a total loser.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.873
Oh, now, Mark, come on.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.208
I mean, you were
the only one that

12:21.241 --> 12:22.609
was smart enough to
know that you were

12:22.642 --> 12:23.743
going to flunk out of school.

12:23.777 --> 12:26.313
That's something, huh?

12:26.346 --> 12:28.615
Thanks.

12:28.648 --> 12:31.919
[sighs] OK, I guess
you're not the only one

12:31.952 --> 12:33.486
to blame for this whole mess.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.589
Maybe I shouldn't have pushed
Becky to push you so hard.

12:36.623 --> 12:37.424
There.

12:40.828 --> 12:42.329
Are you guys OK?

12:42.362 --> 12:43.696
Because Spanish
"Jeopardy" is going

12:43.730 --> 12:44.832
to be on in a few minutes.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.171
Yeah, we're cool.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.606
So does this mean you're gonna
get back together with Darlene?

12:53.640 --> 12:57.477
God, you're looking
smarter every second, Mark.

12:57.510 --> 12:58.545
I'm not married to Darlene.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.147
I'm married to Becky.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.648
Oh, well, then Darlene's
the one that lives

13:01.681 --> 13:02.582
with your brother in Chicago?

13:05.352 --> 13:06.219
What?

13:06.253 --> 13:07.220
He didn't mean that!

13:07.254 --> 13:08.188
He didn't mean Darlene.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.689
He meant, uh, DJ.

13:09.722 --> 13:10.523
Yeah.

13:12.692 --> 13:13.560
Yeah.

13:13.593 --> 13:16.897
David is in Chicago?

13:16.930 --> 13:19.366
So how long have they
been living together?

13:19.399 --> 13:21.768
What the hell am
I asking you for?

13:21.801 --> 13:23.503
He's been up there
ever since he left you.

13:23.536 --> 13:27.274
I can't believe that
they would do this to me.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.709
Wait, wait.

13:29.742 --> 13:32.412
Let's just go up to Chicago.

13:32.445 --> 13:35.582
Why do you want to
take me to Chicago?

13:35.615 --> 13:36.716
[sighs] I don't know.

13:36.749 --> 13:38.118
I'm just trying to help.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.786
Well, what makes you think I
want to sit in a car with you

13:39.819 --> 13:41.654
for an hour and a half?

13:41.688 --> 13:42.722
Because I've $8
bucks gas money.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.062
Let's go.

13:49.096 --> 13:52.065
[music playing]

13:52.099 --> 13:55.502
[music playing]

13:58.571 --> 14:00.773
So any word from
what's his face today?

14:00.807 --> 14:01.674
No.

14:01.708 --> 14:02.976
New subject please.
- Fine.

14:03.010 --> 14:03.877
Fine.

14:03.911 --> 14:05.879
We're not talking about it.

14:05.913 --> 14:07.847
[sighs] My marriage
is falling apart, Dad.

14:07.881 --> 14:09.416
Mark doesn't even care.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.518
I'm sure he cares.

14:11.551 --> 14:15.455
It's just his pride is hurting.

14:15.488 --> 14:17.624
Well, [sighs] I
bet he's sitting

14:17.657 --> 14:19.459
around some pig sty
surrounded by empty

14:19.492 --> 14:22.095
beer cans and pizza boxes.

14:22.129 --> 14:24.764
I bet he's just loving it.

14:24.797 --> 14:26.533
No, I don't think he's
been married long enough

14:26.566 --> 14:30.770
to really truly appreciate it.

14:30.803 --> 14:33.106
I'm never going to
forgive Mom for this.

14:33.140 --> 14:37.577
Becky, your mom's not
what's keeping you guys apart.

14:37.610 --> 14:40.480
Well, Mom's the reason
that Mark went back to school

14:40.513 --> 14:42.849
and flunked, and now he's
never going to face me again.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.452
Well, why don't
you just go to him?

14:45.485 --> 14:46.753
I can't.

14:46.786 --> 14:49.022
Why, is he right?

14:49.056 --> 14:49.990
Are you ashamed of him?

14:50.023 --> 14:50.823
No.

14:54.027 --> 14:56.129
It's just so weird I could fall
in love with someone that could

14:56.163 --> 14:59.967
flunk out of trade school.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.735
Becky, if your
husband flunked,

15:02.769 --> 15:04.504
you got to figure out how
much that bothers you.

15:08.108 --> 15:10.210
It bothers me.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.378
Well, if that's
the way you feel,

15:11.411 --> 15:12.679
maybe it's good he's gone.

15:12.712 --> 15:13.846
No, it's not!

15:13.880 --> 15:15.848
Mark doesn't need
someone looking down on him

15:15.882 --> 15:17.017
for the rest of his life.

15:21.588 --> 15:22.789
You know, that's
that diet margarine.

15:22.822 --> 15:23.690
You got to double up on that.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.766
After a real big fight,
did Mom ever come to you

15:33.800 --> 15:35.368
and say that she
was completely wrong

15:35.402 --> 15:37.704
and that it was all her fault?

15:37.737 --> 15:39.506
When you've been married
as long as your mom and me,

15:39.539 --> 15:41.174
it's not necessary to apologize.

15:44.077 --> 15:46.980
Apparently.

15:47.014 --> 15:50.217
[music playing]

15:52.585 --> 15:53.553
DARLENE: Just get out of my way.

15:56.389 --> 15:57.657
[door slams]

15:57.690 --> 15:58.491
Hi, David.

16:01.394 --> 16:02.662
I found this, uh, pen.

16:02.695 --> 16:04.531
Is it yours?

16:04.564 --> 16:07.400
- Uh, no.
- Oh, OK.

16:07.434 --> 16:09.469
Well, I'll be going then.

16:12.939 --> 16:15.242
Oh, wait a minute.

16:15.275 --> 16:17.444
I forgot to shred the
crap out of you too.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.579
- Mom--
- No, you're not talking.

16:19.612 --> 16:21.681
You're not talking
for a very long time.

16:21.714 --> 16:24.284
And you better sit down, because
this is going to take a while.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.418
Hey, Dave-o.

16:25.452 --> 16:26.253
Mark.

16:28.255 --> 16:29.422
Wow.

16:29.456 --> 16:33.560
You thought you had it all
figured out, didn't you?

16:33.593 --> 16:35.095
You thought you were
going to live together, be

16:35.128 --> 16:37.497
the happy little
couple, and your parents

16:37.530 --> 16:40.333
were just too stupid to
ever find out about it.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.302
You lied to me about Christmas.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.436
You lied to me
about Thanksgiving.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.138
I wanted to come
home for Thanksgiving.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.106
I didn't keep you here.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.240
Oh, yeah right.

16:47.274 --> 16:48.875
Will you stop trying to
put all the blame on me?

16:48.908 --> 16:50.477
You did what you wanted
to do like always.

16:50.510 --> 16:51.844
Well, what do you
expect from me, David?

16:51.878 --> 16:54.147
I am the meanest
person alive, remember?

16:54.181 --> 16:55.515
Hey, both of you--

16:55.548 --> 16:57.284
me!

16:57.317 --> 16:59.486
I'm the one you're
listening to, OK?

16:59.519 --> 17:02.055
I'm the one that you lied to
and betrayed over and over

17:02.089 --> 17:04.291
and over.
- Well, I didn't want to.

17:04.324 --> 17:05.292
I'm sorry if I made you lie.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.326
Look, don't touch me!

17:06.359 --> 17:07.794
God, Darlene, can't
I do anything right?

17:07.827 --> 17:08.761
Hello!

17:08.795 --> 17:10.197
There's a shredding
going on here,

17:10.230 --> 17:13.066
and I came a very
long way to do this.

17:13.100 --> 17:14.534
I don't want any argument
from you, Darlene.

17:14.567 --> 17:15.835
David, you're coming
home with me right now.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.504
Come on, let's go.
End of story.

17:17.537 --> 17:18.405
Good.

17:18.438 --> 17:19.439
You're doing me a favor.

17:19.472 --> 17:20.340
No!

17:20.373 --> 17:22.309
I'm not doing you a favor!

17:22.342 --> 17:23.610
You're not enjoying this.

17:23.643 --> 17:27.914
This is something very
painful that I'm doing to you.

17:27.947 --> 17:28.815
OK.

17:28.848 --> 17:30.650
I got it.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.585
You have no idea
how many phone

17:32.619 --> 17:34.754
calls, discussions,
weekends at home,

17:34.787 --> 17:36.223
and lectures it's
going to take for you

17:36.256 --> 17:37.924
and me to be square again.

17:37.957 --> 17:39.992
All right, I'm sorry, Mom.

17:40.026 --> 17:42.529
David, I threw all
your stuff outside.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.931
So you guys get the suitcases,
and you grab a flashlight,

17:44.964 --> 17:45.998
and we'll go see
what we can find.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.404
So, uh, how's it going?

17:51.438 --> 17:53.840
OK.

17:53.873 --> 17:57.644
[music playing]

17:59.712 --> 18:03.116
ROSEANNE: Plus all the
laundry, plus the dishes,

18:03.150 --> 18:05.385
plus giving birth,
and every other chore

18:05.418 --> 18:07.254
I hate to do around this house.

18:07.287 --> 18:08.621
Where the hell have you been!

18:11.558 --> 18:14.927
And what are you doing here?

18:14.961 --> 18:18.165
And what are you
doing with them?

18:18.198 --> 18:19.266
And-- that's it.

18:19.299 --> 18:22.269
I'm out of questions.

18:22.302 --> 18:23.670
I'll get the
rest of your stuff.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.972
Uh, Dan, I'd like to talk
to you in the other room.

18:26.005 --> 18:27.474
Oh, god, changing rooms.

18:27.507 --> 18:28.375
This can't be good.

18:28.408 --> 18:29.276
Come on.

18:29.309 --> 18:32.245
Come on, Dan.

18:32.279 --> 18:33.380
Well, OK.

18:33.413 --> 18:36.149
So you know, I got this
call from David today,

18:36.183 --> 18:38.485
and him and his mother are
not getting along at all.

18:38.518 --> 18:40.987
So he calls me from this
bus station in Rockford.

18:41.020 --> 18:44.491
Oh, man, we were
afraid of this.

18:44.524 --> 18:45.458
Poor kid.

18:45.492 --> 18:46.559
Is he OK?

18:46.593 --> 18:47.694
Yeah, he's fine.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.562
He just, you know, needs
to be here for a while.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.398
Well, I got to hand it to you.

18:51.431 --> 18:53.966
You had a feeling this
was going to happen.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.702
[exhales] Nothing gets by me.

18:58.271 --> 18:59.138
David.

18:59.172 --> 19:00.006
Yes, sir?

19:03.476 --> 19:06.078
Um, look, I'm sorry.

19:06.112 --> 19:07.914
I really am.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.682
I'm glad you're back.

19:09.716 --> 19:10.517
We missed you.

19:13.886 --> 19:17.857
I told him, and
he went insane.

19:17.890 --> 19:18.758
Oh, god.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.227
Nah.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.794
I didn't tell him.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.496
If you're going to have a
fighting chance with him,

19:23.530 --> 19:25.164
you're going to need
me on your side.

19:25.198 --> 19:28.701
And for that, I'm going
to need plenty of sleep.

19:28.735 --> 19:31.003
Thank you.

19:31.037 --> 19:33.340
Of course, you
know, uh, I have

19:33.373 --> 19:35.975
been known to talk in my sleep.

19:36.008 --> 19:39.746
Sometimes Dan
walks in his sleep.

19:39.779 --> 19:40.780
But rest well, David.

19:43.750 --> 19:46.253
Well, I guess I'll,
uh, get going, too.

19:46.286 --> 19:49.088
Well, don't you
want to talk to Becky?

19:49.121 --> 19:51.458
Nah, she's probably asleep.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.192
She's probably not asleep.

19:53.226 --> 19:57.096
(YELLING) Becky, come down here!

19:57.129 --> 19:59.131
Look, I don't know if
I can see her right now.

19:59.165 --> 20:02.669
I mean, how do I look?

20:02.702 --> 20:05.672
Like every mother's nightmare.

20:05.705 --> 20:08.140
She'll love you.

20:08.174 --> 20:08.975
Look who dropped in.

20:12.512 --> 20:15.282
And, um, I think he
wants to talk to you.

20:15.315 --> 20:16.883
Don't you, Mark?

20:16.916 --> 20:18.318
Yeah.

20:18.351 --> 20:22.054
And I'm sure that you
would really love to listen.

20:22.088 --> 20:23.923
And this just happens
to be a really

20:23.956 --> 20:25.425
good listening spot right here.

20:25.458 --> 20:29.329
This is where Dan sits and
does most of his listening.

20:29.362 --> 20:30.397
Do you wanna?

20:30.430 --> 20:31.230
Yeah.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.009
- Are you coming to bed?
- Shh, shh.

20:43.042 --> 20:43.910
What?

20:43.943 --> 20:45.945
[gasps] Are they talking?

20:45.978 --> 20:47.914
Yeah, and maybe if Mark
doesn't say too much,

20:47.947 --> 20:49.616
they can patch things up.

20:49.649 --> 20:51.050
- Damn.
- What?

20:51.083 --> 20:52.919
I thought you wanted them
to get back together.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.153
Oh, I do.

20:54.186 --> 20:59.258
I just don't have any excuse
to go over to Roy's now.

20:59.292 --> 21:03.129
