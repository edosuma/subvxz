00:31.886 --> 00:34.001
Hello there partners.

00:37.430 --> 00:39.131
<i>ANNOUNCEMENT: Yeah, out over here
out over here,</i>

00:39.131 --> 00:41.533
<i>ring toss ring toss.
Ring it by now, hey</i>

00:44.880 --> 00:46.419
Hank: Now kick up your
leg Bobby,

00:46.419 --> 00:49.666
Arch your back, whip your
forearm and snap your wrist.

00:51.247 --> 00:52.826
Bobby: Ugh, look out.

00:52.826 --> 00:53.645
Hey, man.

00:54.523 --> 00:58.039
Bobby you better let me
throw the last one.

00:58.401 --> 01:00.524
This man here's trying to
run a business.

01:04.662 --> 01:07.160
Hank: Now ping pong balls
are tricky,

01:07.465 --> 01:10.378
don't grip it hard
it requires fineness.

01:10.900 --> 01:12.407
Bobby, what's in your mouth.

01:12.976 --> 01:15.229
Look dad, I'm the
khamish

01:16.219 --> 01:16.912
Owh!.

01:19.049 --> 01:22.488
It's okay to line up the sights, Bobby.
It's not cheating.

01:28.465 --> 01:29.284
I got it.

01:29.645 --> 01:32.002
Wew! Lucky shot Bobby, that's great.

01:32.497 --> 01:34.101
Now this time you might wanna..

01:37.524 --> 01:40.099
Bobby way to kill ducks.

01:41.762 --> 01:44.382
Then another duck came up, and
he killed that one.

01:44.382 --> 01:47.600
And then I killed another one too.
Hank: Yep, that's right.

01:47.600 --> 01:49.927
He must have killed
a thousand ducks.

01:49.927 --> 01:52.157
Peggy: Now a thousand ducks,

01:52.493 --> 01:55.840
well that is wonderful.
Did you kill any bunnies?

01:56.952 --> 01:58.462
Hank: The boy shows a real..

01:58.462 --> 02:01.580
talent for shooting Peggy,
this could be his sport.

02:01.901 --> 02:04.825
Hank: We should get him a rifle..
- Mmhm! Bobby is too young to own a rifle

02:04.825 --> 02:06.211
it is too dangerous.

02:06.211 --> 02:10.048
He's twelve, he hasn't been too
young for five years.

02:10.048 --> 02:13.330
No it is just not age
appropriate.

02:13.330 --> 02:16.325
It would be like..like giving boggle
to an eight year old,

02:16.325 --> 02:18.379
even though the box says
that's okay.

02:18.379 --> 02:22.862
But I never get to bond with Bobby,
on account of he's not good at much

02:22.862 --> 02:26.896
Shooting stuff is something
a father and son can do together.

02:27.269 --> 02:30.398
I don't wanna wait till
the cat's in cradle and Bobby's...

02:30.398 --> 02:33.427
..too busy with the
propane business of his own.

02:34.715 --> 02:37.496
Peggy: Now Hank, you're making
me tear up.

02:41.494 --> 02:46.301
Hank: Uh! where's the children's gun section?
- Aisle 47.

02:47.928 --> 02:50.338
- Can I keep my new gun in my room.
- Sure.

02:50.338 --> 02:52.368
Can I keep the bullets
in my pocket.

02:52.368 --> 02:55.561
Hank: If you want.
Bobby: Can I put a gun rack on my bike.

02:56.804 --> 03:00.193
Do you know how long I've been
waiting for you to ask me that.

03:06.002 --> 03:08.821
I have a good feeling about this one.

03:08.821 --> 03:10.975
Ooh! I love this rifle.

03:10.975 --> 03:15.684
You know Bobby that marlin is lot like
the first .22 my dad gave me,

03:15.684 --> 03:19.002
that's also like the one he
started with himself as a boy.

03:19.398 --> 03:21.156
kind of a Hill tradition,

03:25.577 --> 03:26.379
Bobby: Wow!

03:26.379 --> 03:29.052
I always thought this was
a Crack house.

03:30.067 --> 03:31.998
Dale: So then Ray walks in

03:31.998 --> 03:37.245
with the same snow camouflaged bib overalls
that he knew I plan to wear that same hunting

03:37.758 --> 03:42.956
Well well well, Hank Hill you finally
decided to join our club.

03:42.956 --> 03:46.869
I'm not joining, I just want to know
if I can use the range, Dale.

03:46.869 --> 03:50.087
There's a $2 charge for
non members to shot here.

03:50.087 --> 03:51.919
What's membership cost?

03:51.919 --> 03:53.998
Life-time membership is free.

03:58.704 --> 04:01.179
Ah! I'll just pay the two bucks.

04:02.194 --> 04:05.189
Hank's jacket is so Desert Storm.

04:05.768 --> 04:08.790
The safety is underneath by the
firing pin.

04:09.310 --> 04:11.934
I hope you're listening,
because I'm not repeating this.

04:15.395 --> 04:19.093
Now, Bobby you gotta take it slow
and oh my God!

04:20.009 --> 04:22.781
Stranger: Boy can shoot.
Hank: Hell yeah! He's my boy.

04:23.254 --> 04:25.709
What you've done here
is very good.

04:26.006 --> 04:28.224
I'm a little upset with
the grouping

04:28.224 --> 04:31.640
You fellas entering the tournament
at the county club, 'cause if you are..

04:31.640 --> 04:35.007
- ..maybe I'll save myself the entry fee.
- What tournament?

04:35.007 --> 04:36.861
Father- son fun shoot.

04:36.861 --> 04:39.277
It's sponsored by the Arlen
endowment for the arts.

04:39.785 --> 04:41.627
Save your money mister,
we're in.

04:41.944 --> 04:46.622
Alright! all this being father and son
is finally gonna pay off.

04:47.097 --> 04:50.523
Hey, Bobby! go inside and get
a couple of bags of bullets.

04:51.656 --> 04:56.923
I forget the last time I shot a .22, but
I'll bet you, there was a Texan in the White House.

04:56.923 --> 05:00.276
And I ain't talking about,
Herbert Walker Bush either.

05:02.513 --> 05:03.761
Aah! Ooh!

05:03.761 --> 05:07.965
Grandpa: What are you waiting for boy?
Pull the trigger make some noise.

05:12.139 --> 05:15.644
You're never gonna be a war hero
like me if you shoot like that.

05:15.644 --> 05:20.733
no wonder that kid from the play ground stole
your pale , he knows you can't shoot.

05:21.216 --> 05:22.563
I want my binky back.

05:23.023 --> 05:26.805
You want your binky back,
you gotta come in firing.

05:26.805 --> 05:28.607
Now try again.

05:43.799 --> 05:44.691
Hmmm.

05:53.252 --> 05:55.311
- That's a nice gun.
- Yep!

05:56.479 --> 05:57.866
That's a cool gun.

05:58.262 --> 05:58.915
Uh ha!

05:59.529 --> 06:03.173
Well, it is so nice to see
the two of you really talking.

06:03.639 --> 06:05.837
This gun's very nice.

06:05.837 --> 06:08.966
They are all nice gun's and
all gun's are nice.

06:08.966 --> 06:10.886
So, how'd shootin' go yesterday.

06:11.184 --> 06:13.524
Great!
I hit the center every time.

06:13.837 --> 06:17.880
Well, that's terrific honey, in no time
at all you'll be better that your father.

06:17.880 --> 06:19.843
Now what's that supposed to mean,

06:19.843 --> 06:23.170
Let's see him hold down a job
and be so good.

06:23.663 --> 06:27.940
Hey! Look at these father and son
Poncho's, they zip together.

06:27.940 --> 06:30.057
Dad, can we get 'em for
the tournament.

06:30.426 --> 06:35.924
Look, Bobby before we start buying a lot of
paraphernalia and accessories and what not,

06:35.924 --> 06:40.109
let's make sure we're not getting into
another tap lesson situation here.

06:40.565 --> 06:43.042
Why don't we get in
to one of those safety courses

06:43.042 --> 06:46.331
and if you're still interested after
they've taken all the fun out of it,

06:46.331 --> 06:48.885
then we'll see about the Poncho's
and the...

06:49.399 --> 06:50.759
Aaah!
Tournament.

06:51.959 --> 06:53.898
I didn't know it was loaded,

06:54.353 --> 06:56.452
is not an acceptable excuse.

06:56.769 --> 07:02.234
I wasn't there or I've never meet those
people or better excuses.

07:02.741 --> 07:07.533
When I was your age, I used to get
so excited about hitting the target,

07:07.890 --> 07:10.226
I'd run, right out
on to the range.

07:10.632 --> 07:14.671
that's how I lost this thumb,
and later this eye.

07:14.671 --> 07:19.245
If it weren't for the N.R A safety guidelines
I eventually accepted

07:19.551 --> 07:21.986
I'd be a stub
standing here before you.

07:24.734 --> 07:30.041
Okay, so I discharge the magazine first,
no..first I put the safety.

07:30.397 --> 07:32.081
You just put six shot
dead center,

07:32.081 --> 07:34.734
I know, so do I lay
the magazine...

07:34.734 --> 07:37.450
Hey, look at here.
Look at this everybody.

07:39.505 --> 07:40.580
Hank: You see its just..

07:40.580 --> 07:43.055
I'm too busy for a competition.

07:43.055 --> 07:45.492
we're coming up on
the new propane season,

07:45.492 --> 07:50.066
plus next week I was going to cheque in
to buy a Hek Dorlan's motor cycle.

07:50.066 --> 07:54.326
But you said if I was still interested
and I am still interested.

07:54.326 --> 07:56.406
Peggy: Hank you love guns,

07:56.406 --> 07:59.475
Bobby loves guns,
curve the time.

08:02.420 --> 08:04.875
Bobby: Why do we
have to practice so early.

08:04.875 --> 08:09.133
Hank: I want you to get used to the
pressure of shooting when no one's watching.

08:12.879 --> 08:14.226
Hank: Ah..hah!

08:14.562 --> 08:17.255
What's wrong with you?
Why don't you steady yourself?

08:17.552 --> 08:20.265
Uh! This is a training exercise.

08:20.265 --> 08:23.792
Close one eye, how can you hit anything
the way you're holding it.

08:24.168 --> 08:25.792
don't grip the barrel so hard,

08:25.792 --> 08:28.666
- it requires fineness.
Grandpa: Someday..

08:28.666 --> 08:36.150
soon, all of you will be drafted in the war
some of you like Hank, will be killed.

08:36.571 --> 08:38.986
Others can shoot and
they become war heroes

08:39.561 --> 08:41.818
Now commence to firing.

08:48.447 --> 08:51.991
Uh! Something's wrong with my rifle,
I can't shoot to-day.

08:51.991 --> 08:53.773
- Let me see it.
- No.

08:53.773 --> 08:55.734
Come on!
I bet, I can fix it.

08:56.676 --> 08:58.928
You can't fix it,
It's in the shaft.

09:00.557 --> 09:02.458
There's no shaft on a gun.

09:13.105 --> 09:14.610
It's tough shootin' out there today.

09:15.560 --> 09:18.986
Yeah! I mean keeping the gun steady
can take a lot out of the man.

09:19.303 --> 09:22.610
Aah! Do you mind
I'm trying to sit here.

09:23.303 --> 09:26.551
Maybe I can help you.
I'm a sports psychologist.

09:27.125 --> 09:29.580
- I worked with the Cowboy's.
- When?

09:29.580 --> 09:31.349
- Last season.
- Goodbye.

09:31.349 --> 09:33.547
Okay, but consider this..

09:34.137 --> 09:39.474
Researches show that athletic performance
is 10% physical and a 100% mental.

09:39.746 --> 09:42.217
That adds up to a 110%

09:42.524 --> 09:43.310
Break through!

09:43.627 --> 09:46.985
Do you just hang out here all day waiting
for someone to mess a lot.

09:47.301 --> 09:50.204
Oh, just in the mornings
when the lousy shoots arrive.

09:50.584 --> 09:52.231
in the afternoons
I go to the bowling alley.

09:52.615 --> 09:54.035
Losers are very predictable.

09:54.035 --> 09:55.074
Here's my card.

09:56.033 --> 09:57.254
You're going to tear it up.

10:03.490 --> 10:06.532
Bobby: Well what about practicing
for the tournament after school.

10:06.776 --> 10:09.551
Hank: Nah, I'd have to come
here to get you then...

10:09.551 --> 10:11.985
go back across town to the range.

10:12.336 --> 10:16.265
- That could eat up ten minutes.
- What about shootin after dinner?

10:16.567 --> 10:19.786
No no you don't want to exercise
on a full stomach

10:20.147 --> 10:25.368
Well, maybe I can take the gun's to school and
we could squeeze off a few rounds between classes

10:25.368 --> 10:28.938
You shouldn't take guns to school
with you, they're dangerous.

10:29.340 --> 10:30.786
Guns are dangerous?

10:31.043 --> 10:31.716
Dale: What?

10:32.627 --> 10:33.598
Oh! Brother.

10:35.613 --> 10:39.098
Bobby go on and clean the guns
I'll be in there, in a minute.

10:39.577 --> 10:42.840
Bill: Well..what da..what's this
about guns being dangerous.

10:43.094 --> 10:45.771
Well, that right they kill people.

10:46.029 --> 10:48.817
Dale: Guns don't kill people
the Government does.

10:48.817 --> 10:54.787
Bill: Oh! Hank gun's been around for years if they're
dangerous I just, think someone would've said something.

10:55.049 --> 10:59.437
Most..uh..deaths in the home
are from gun's and gun accessories.

10:59.437 --> 11:01.107
Let me ask you this.

11:01.107 --> 11:04.624
A guy breaks into your house,
but you don't have a gun.

11:05.020 --> 11:06.873
How are you going to shoot him?

11:06.873 --> 11:10.865
Dale that's right out of
the N.R.A. magazine August issue.

11:10.865 --> 11:14.651
I tell you what man, the dang old N.R.A's
all rights man..da..da..insurance

11:14.651 --> 11:17.474
together with dismemberment na like that,
you get a twenty thousand dollars

11:17.474 --> 11:19.506
just for your arm blows up man.

11:19.747 --> 11:21.396
I can't believe you guy's.

11:21.856 --> 11:26.224
Dale the N.R.A. is a Washington .D.C
based organization.

11:26.224 --> 11:29.255
Are you telling me
you support Washington D.C.

11:33.265 --> 11:34.267
That's a planker.

11:35.092 --> 11:40.051
I'm a little confused here, how are you
goin' to win that shootin' contest without a rifle?

11:40.051 --> 11:45.515
Haven't you been listening to me,
I'm not goin' to shoot in any contest.

11:47.184 --> 11:48.485
Sorry, Bobby.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.787
Bobby honey, you've been
sleeping in that vest for two weeks.

12:00.158 --> 12:01.025
What's wrong?

12:01.397 --> 12:05.633
I think I messed up.
I made dad not like guns anymore.

12:06.036 --> 12:07.739
Oh, son that can't be true.

12:07.739 --> 12:10.402
Your fathers love for guns
is unconditional.

12:10.402 --> 12:13.437
Then why doesn't he want to shoot
with me in the tournament.

12:13.437 --> 12:16.007
Is he afraid I'm gonna embarrass him.

12:16.496 --> 12:20.428
Well, it must be
because he loves guns.

12:22.751 --> 12:24.082
Peggy:
What has got into you?

12:24.082 --> 12:27.210
You were right Bobby's too
young to own a gun.

12:27.210 --> 12:28.689
No, I was wrong.

12:29.091 --> 12:32.714
Guns are keeping this family together
and Bobby's really good.

12:32.714 --> 12:34.944
He won't let you down
with the fun shoot.

12:35.470 --> 12:40.146
- Uh! that's not why I'm dropping out.
- Well then what is the reason?

12:42.569 --> 12:45.263
- Peggy, I can't shoot.
- What?!

12:45.635 --> 12:50.001
I can't, my aim is terrible,
I can barely keep the gun steady.

12:52.313 --> 12:54.666
[ Inhales and exhales]

12:55.692 --> 12:57.798
I still love you.

12:57.798 --> 13:01.018
Yeah, but will the rest of the town
be so forgiving.

13:01.018 --> 13:03.049
But it's a risk
you have to take Hank.

13:03.545 --> 13:09.397
Bobby's finally found something he's really great at,
do not reap that away from him, it is not fare.

13:09.955 --> 13:13.020
Life's not fare.
That's a good lesson for the boy.

13:13.020 --> 13:15.559
What if they had never
let you play football huh!

13:15.559 --> 13:20.359
You'd still have that little bone in your ankle,
but you'd not have any of the memories.

13:29.687 --> 13:34.889
Hah! Go get your clothes out of the thrash
we'll need'em for the contest.

13:35.291 --> 13:37.614
You mean it dad, you'll shoot with me?

13:38.551 --> 13:40.896
Yeah! on your team we have to win.

13:41.207 --> 13:43.109
You never lost anything in your life.

13:43.452 --> 13:47.634
Well, Bobby
can't always expect to win ha..ha!

13:47.634 --> 13:51.043
No dad, I promise I won't choke.

13:51.399 --> 13:57.305
Sometimes, people choke Bobby we just got to be
proud that God took the time to give us a fault.

13:57.591 --> 14:01.773
That's looser talk you taught me that.
No Hill's ever been a looser.

14:01.773 --> 14:04.092
We fight for Texas at the Alamo.

14:04.376 --> 14:05.982
We're gonna get a trophy.

14:07.017 --> 14:08.266
Ah..ha!

14:14.485 --> 14:15.952
Alright, here's the deal.

14:16.261 --> 14:20.494
I don't believe in that gobble de good about a subconscious or any other

14:20.494 --> 14:21.699
- witch-craft.
- Mmm.

14:21.699 --> 14:25.296
I won't take pills, I won't let you
hypnotize or molest me.

14:25.857 --> 14:29.996
Well, I can help you without using
witchcraft, pills and molestation.

14:30.252 --> 14:31.105
But it won't be easy.

14:31.928 --> 14:36.146
Visualization is probably the only legitimate part
what people like myself practice.

14:36.561 --> 14:40.107
Imagine the dart flying
from your gun to the target.

14:40.891 --> 14:43.387
Don't pull the trigger until you see it.

14:45.249 --> 14:49.447
<i>Grandpa Hill: Hank! shaky close
the other eye or I'll poke it out.</i>

14:53.490 --> 14:56.658
Ah! whenever I start to shoot,
even aim I..

14:57.133 --> 15:00.658
I remember me as a boy
my dad behind me yellin'an..

15:01.450 --> 15:03.529
Hah! I always let him down.

15:03.851 --> 15:07.376
- I was so scared of..
- Hank please you're wasting valuable session time.

15:07.896 --> 15:10.985
Now, it's important for you to
stay relaxed.

15:11.322 --> 15:14.708
Why don't you imagine something gentle
say, say a butterfly...

15:14.708 --> 15:17.229
taking the dart and flying it to the target

15:17.525 --> 15:20.079
I am not imagining a butterfly.

15:20.079 --> 15:21.651
Alright, how about a humming bird.

15:21.651 --> 15:25.435
How about a McDonnell Douglas L1011
wide body.

15:32.242 --> 15:34.413
Good! Now let's do better.

15:34.809 --> 15:38.446
We add audio to the visualization
to achieve complete focus,

15:38.970 --> 15:40.174
as you imagine the plane

15:40.174 --> 15:43.042
say out loud
to the end of the rainbow.

15:43.254 --> 15:45.830
- I'm not saying...
- Oh! say whatever you want.

15:46.186 --> 15:48.449
Prepare for top speed.

15:50.768 --> 15:51.136
Wow!

15:54.256 --> 15:56.595
Welcome everyone! welcome shooters!

15:56.595 --> 16:00.150
welcome last year's winners
John and Mike McKay.

16:01.695 --> 16:03.577
Peggy: My fingers are crossed for you.

16:04.197 --> 16:07.336
<i>Announcer: The format for today,
is the same as last year.</i>

16:07.336 --> 16:09.492
<i> Start with the tandem shoot.</i>

16:10.235 --> 16:11.888
<i>then the quick draw,</i>

16:12.284 --> 16:18.979
<i> followed by the pretend to be sleeping, cramp the loaded
gun under the bed and shoot a figure in the shadows.</i>

16:19.725 --> 16:21.215
<i>then to our favorite event.</i>

16:21.215 --> 16:26.289
<i>the all new expanded, simulated hunting experience
that we like to call the Goblet.</i>

16:29.225 --> 16:34.019
and finally, just in case some of the dad's
have been doin' all of the work,

16:34.019 --> 16:37.529
<i>the independent long-range accuracy shooting.</i>

16:38.034 --> 16:41.128
Come on dad,
let's go bag us a trophy.

16:41.678 --> 16:44.253
And..have fun..Ha!

16:46.191 --> 16:48.093
Man: This here's tandem shoot,
take your first shot.

16:48.562 --> 16:51.530
Oh! prepare for top speed.

16:57.267 --> 16:58.104
Man: One hit.

16:58.509 --> 17:00.412
That wasn't a practice round.

17:00.665 --> 17:03.849
Ah! okay! I just gotta
make a little adjustment here.

17:04.077 --> 17:05.054
Ready for your second shot.

17:05.309 --> 17:07.236
Doctor: Hey! hey! over here.

17:10.098 --> 17:13.281
Ah! somethin' somethin' rainbow.

17:13.692 --> 17:16.012
Going to the rainbo..

17:18.666 --> 17:19.872
Hey, good going.

17:25.771 --> 17:27.053
<i>Over the rainbow.</i>

17:32.119 --> 17:34.947
I guess I'm fallin' into my groove. he..he!

17:46.173 --> 17:48.532
<i>The end of the yellow brick road.</i>

17:52.388 --> 17:54.709
<i>How 'bout a little fire scarecrow.</i>

17:57.471 --> 17:58.410
Boo!

17:59.209 --> 18:00.655
<i>Announcer: Two point deduction.</i>

18:16.600 --> 18:18.934
Well, look at that
we're in second place.

18:19.416 --> 18:20.468
Luanne: Good news.

18:20.868 --> 18:26.068
The McKay's just came out of the gun let and
the young one blew out an entire picnicking family.

18:26.339 --> 18:28.419
That means we're tied for first.

18:28.419 --> 18:29.383
Grandpa Hill: Sorry I'm late.

18:29.383 --> 18:29.727
Oh!

18:29.727 --> 18:34.760
I had to stop by the wax-museum again
and give the finger to F.D.R.

18:34.760 --> 18:36.647
Grandpa, you came!

18:36.647 --> 18:38.766
I'm always here
to support my Bobby.

18:39.082 --> 18:40.944
And I'll give you
a shoulder to cry on,

18:41.197 --> 18:42.733
you'll need one, won't he Hank?

18:42.733 --> 18:45.598
As a matter of fact, we're
tied for first.

18:45.851 --> 18:48.259
All we have left
is the accuracy round.

18:48.556 --> 18:51.883
Accuracy! better hope
that target's the size of a barn.

18:52.279 --> 18:53.166
Come on Bobby.

18:59.433 --> 19:00.732
<i>Crowd applauding.</i>

19:00.948 --> 19:04.101
Remember son, we're just
here to do our best.

19:04.101 --> 19:06.323
That's 'cause weare the best. Dad.

19:14.743 --> 19:18.495
That's my grandson and his father.

19:21.574 --> 19:23.368
Bobby: Dad if he misses,

19:23.652 --> 19:24.372
we win!

19:24.763 --> 19:26.983
No, Bobby we don't want to win that way.

19:29.579 --> 19:30.288
Damn!

19:30.288 --> 19:33.161
Come on Hank!
I got money riding on this shot.

19:33.894 --> 19:35.303
On the McKay's.

19:41.312 --> 19:43.998
<i> Okay Hank! it's time for take-off.</i>

19:44.771 --> 19:47.276
<i>you know what to do,
not just for you but for Bobby.</i>

19:47.971 --> 19:50.861
<i>so focus, stop talking to yourself and do it.</i>

19:52.508 --> 19:53.694
<i>You're still talkin'.</i>

19:54.434 --> 19:56.117
<i>You're here to talk or you're here to shoot.</i>

19:58.373 --> 20:00.816
<i>I'm here to shoot,
end of discussion.</i>

20:07.041 --> 20:07.792
Let's do it.

20:11.492 --> 20:11.898
Man: Miss.

20:12.477 --> 20:14.991
<i>Announcer: And the McKay's win again.</i>

20:15.909 --> 20:17.379
Crowd applauding.

20:26.351 --> 20:28.642
Ah! Where's Bobby?

20:30.095 --> 20:31.038
Oh!

20:31.902 --> 20:36.723
We did it dad, 2nd place
in a real father-son tournament!

20:36.964 --> 20:38.244
Can I put it on my wall,

20:38.536 --> 20:41.481
<i>we were so good out there,
we should always be shootin'.</i>

20:41.744 --> 20:43.123
<i>This is the best day ever.</i>

20:43.390 --> 20:44.657
You're the best dad ever.

20:45.033 --> 20:46.219
I'm the best son ever.

20:46.467 --> 20:48.069
Bobby: Can we do it again next year?

20:50.572 --> 20:51.110
A..Ha!

20:51.678 --> 20:52.502
Heh! Yeah!

20:53.333 --> 20:56.709
Yeah, we could do it again.
If that's what you want?

20:59.581 --> 21:00.241
<i>Hey! kid.</i>

21:05.400 --> 21:07.072
Bobby: I feel like ice-cream.

21:07.448 --> 21:08.532
Hank: That sounds good.

21:09.377 --> 21:11.384
Hank: Aaa! where'd we park?

21:12.063 --> 21:12.874
Bobby: That way.

21:20.174 --> 21:21.309
Bobby: We forgot mom.

21:21.837 --> 21:23.945
Hank: Oh! well, let's go get her.

22:10.191 --> 22:11.651
I want my binky back.

22:12.305 --> 22:18.633
