00:08.685 --> 00:11.251
<i>Our dad could have
beat the shit out of your dad.</i>

00:11.253 --> 00:13.386
<i>I'm not bragging,
it's just a fact.</i>

00:13.388 --> 00:15.555
<i>You may have heard that
the human head weighs 11 pounds</i>

00:15.557 --> 00:17.324
<i>and the neck
shouldn't be able to support it.</i>

00:17.326 --> 00:19.727
<i>Our dad's
mustache alone weighed 12,</i>

00:19.729 --> 00:23.229
<i>and his neck didn't give a shit,
because it was basically a third bicep.</i>

00:23.231 --> 00:24.599
<i>He drove an '89 350.</i>

00:24.601 --> 00:26.466
<i>Got ten miles to the gallon,</i>

00:26.468 --> 00:28.903
<i>but he offset his carbon
footprint by growing our mom</i>

00:28.905 --> 00:33.340
<i>a fresh bouquet of flowers
every single day.</i>

00:33.342 --> 00:34.642
<i>I still drive it.</i>

00:34.644 --> 00:36.343
<i>Him and our mom had three boys.</i>

00:36.345 --> 00:39.212
<i>Adam, that's me, Tim, and Kevin.</i>

00:39.214 --> 00:40.480
<i>With our powers combined,</i>

00:40.482 --> 00:41.949
<i>we never once
got him to the ground,</i>

00:41.951 --> 00:45.454
<i>and Tim was a high school state
champion wrestler in junior high.</i>

00:46.188 --> 00:48.923
<i>Every summer, we'd go to the
cabin he built with his bare hands,</i>

00:48.925 --> 00:51.224
<i>because tools are for cowards,</i>

00:51.226 --> 00:52.893
<i>and he showed us
everything there was to know</i>

00:52.895 --> 00:53.796
<i>about being a man.</i>

00:54.998 --> 00:58.264
<i>Building fires, chopping
down trees, subduing bears.</i>

00:58.266 --> 00:59.532
<i>You know, the basics.</i>

00:59.534 --> 01:01.534
<i>He called it "Man Camp",</i>

01:01.536 --> 01:04.705
<i>and then
when I was 16 years old,</i>

01:04.706 --> 01:06.841
<i>he ran into the one thing that
he couldn't take down</i>

01:06.843 --> 01:09.244
<i>with his world class
ax throwing abilities.</i>

01:09.979 --> 01:10.880
<i>He got cancer.</i>

01:11.914 --> 01:14.314
<i>And within months,</i>

01:14.316 --> 01:16.284
<i>the greatest man to
walk the planet was gone.</i>

01:17.787 --> 01:20.688
<i>Now, your dad
might still be alive,</i>

01:20.690 --> 01:23.256
<i>but if they ever
do throw down in Heaven,</i>

01:23.258 --> 01:25.660
<i>or you know, I don't
how all that's going to work,</i>

01:25.662 --> 01:26.461
<i>but if they do,</i>

01:27.629 --> 01:31.231
<i>our dad will absolutely
beat the shit out of your dad.</i>

01:49.852 --> 01:51.186
Can we not do this today?

01:53.022 --> 01:54.755
Stop licking it, eat it.

01:56.726 --> 01:59.392
If you like the taste,
then put it all the way in.

01:59.394 --> 02:02.562
If you like the way it tastes,
then put it in your belly.

02:02.564 --> 02:04.965
Look at me, you eat
that oatmeal right now.

02:04.967 --> 02:07.634
You put it in your mouth and you
swallow it or I will take your blankie

02:07.636 --> 02:10.402
and I will burn it like Captain
von Trapp burning the Nazi flag.

02:10.405 --> 02:12.940
Do you understand? I can
get rid of you in a second, bud.

02:12.942 --> 02:14.711
They got orphanages
on every corner.

02:17.312 --> 02:19.479
I thought the breakfast
battle would be over by now.

02:19.481 --> 02:21.949
Hey, is this thing ours,
because I'm not,

02:21.951 --> 02:23.718
I'm not feeling
super sure about it.

02:23.720 --> 02:26.020
You saw him come out of me, so.

02:26.022 --> 02:28.791
Indeed, indeed I did.
How was the gym?

02:29.424 --> 02:31.759
Ugh, Kristen, you know,

02:31.761 --> 02:34.561
the one who is
only eating raw bacteria

02:34.563 --> 02:37.064
for three weeks
to reset my vagina?

02:37.066 --> 02:38.933
Cornered me about
her pyramid scheme again.

02:38.935 --> 02:41.668
- Did you get in the pyramid, babe?
- No, I did not, babe.

02:41.670 --> 02:43.670
Babe, you got a chance
to get in a pyramid,

02:43.672 --> 02:45.873
you get in there, you get
that forbidden treasure, babe.

02:45.875 --> 02:47.407
Oh, you're dumb.

02:47.409 --> 02:49.444
- Did you start packing for your trip yet?
- Yeah.

02:50.445 --> 02:52.012
Yeah, yeah?

02:52.014 --> 02:54.547
What is the matter with you?
It's Man Camp Week!

02:54.549 --> 02:57.918
Usually you're all like,
"Oh, cook up this meat!

02:57.920 --> 02:59.820
Grab me a beer,
scratch my balls.

02:59.822 --> 03:01.321
Yeah."

03:01.323 --> 03:04.524
- Whoa!
- Wow, that's what I'm like?

03:04.526 --> 03:06.127
Yeah, when you're
with the your brothers, yes.

03:06.129 --> 03:09.329
Well, I'm just a little tired of being
the only adult in the family, you know?

03:09.331 --> 03:11.866
It's been like
babysitting the last few years.

03:13.368 --> 03:15.938
Not now, Artiz,
I'm trying to make a point.

03:17.907 --> 03:18.973
Really?

03:18.975 --> 03:20.875
Listen, can't you just,

03:20.877 --> 03:22.810
like, crack the whip
and tell me I can't go?

03:22.812 --> 03:25.413
- Crack... the whip?
- Yeah.

03:26.548 --> 03:28.748
- You know, the whip.
- Oh, ugh, mm.

03:28.750 --> 03:29.784
Lots of wives do it.

03:29.786 --> 03:30.885
You're disgusting and no,

03:30.887 --> 03:33.988
I'm not going to let you
end your 12 year tradition

03:33.990 --> 03:37.357
of celebrating your dad's life at the cabin, okay?

03:37.359 --> 03:38.326
Now, I'm going to go shower.

03:39.128 --> 03:41.561
I've had a morning, okay?
Clean this up, please.

03:41.563 --> 03:42.863
- Thank you.
- Okay, bye.

03:42.865 --> 03:44.733
- Bye, I love you.
- Love you.

03:45.367 --> 03:47.802
Oh, hey, babe? Uh, we got to
burn Max's blankie.

03:47.804 --> 03:49.669
I can't afford to
make another idle threat.

03:49.671 --> 03:51.073
- Have fun. Bye.
- Bye.

03:55.044 --> 03:56.442
Don't get too drunk.

03:56.444 --> 03:57.814
- I will!
- Okay.

03:59.916 --> 04:03.052
Oh, God, okay. Uh, yeah.

04:04.419 --> 04:05.654
Yep, okay.

04:06.388 --> 04:07.520
There... there you go.

04:26.608 --> 04:29.442
What the hell do you want, man? It's like 10:00 in the morning.

04:29.444 --> 04:32.512
Yeah, man, that's not early,
so is Tim around?

04:32.514 --> 04:34.716
- Tim, resident Tim?
- Yeah.

04:35.450 --> 04:37.151
Yeah, nobody
comes in just to see Tim.

04:37.153 --> 04:38.618
Not nobody, not no how.

04:38.620 --> 04:40.054
Yeah, man,
I'm his older brother, so.

04:40.056 --> 04:43.059
Oh, bro, why didn't you say so?
Come on in.

04:48.530 --> 04:51.831
This guy from
the President Tim poster.

04:51.833 --> 04:55.437
Hey, man, I saw
a picture of your wife.

04:57.772 --> 04:59.507
- Did you?
- Yeah, it's right there.

04:59.909 --> 05:03.443
It's actually a
picture of you and your wife.

05:03.445 --> 05:06.013
Not a day goes
by that I don't regret

05:06.015 --> 05:07.714
letting that
little one off the hook.

05:07.716 --> 05:09.582
I, I don't know
what you mean, what?

05:09.584 --> 05:13.755
Me and Katie, we were a...
a thing.

05:14.556 --> 05:15.690
All right, what about this?

05:16.125 --> 05:18.591
<i>♪ Let's get the starty parted! ♪</i>

05:18.593 --> 05:20.428
<i>♪ Ooh, ooh! ♪</i>

05:23.531 --> 05:25.099
Eric Brinkerhoff?

05:25.101 --> 05:26.701

05:35.644 --> 05:38.845
Katie Baker is married... to me.

05:40.983 --> 05:42.182
- Tim.
- Adam!

05:42.184 --> 05:43.750

05:43.752 --> 05:45.685

05:45.687 --> 05:47.654

06:12.781 --> 06:14.814
- What's up, dude?
- Did you skip the party last night?

06:14.816 --> 06:16.649
Uh, I wasn't
really in the mood to rage,

06:16.651 --> 06:19.752
but I saw the ladies
in here and wowza,

06:19.754 --> 06:23.023
so I kept it to a 12-pack
and hung around for a bit

06:23.025 --> 06:24.557
to fulfill
my presidential duties,

06:24.559 --> 06:26.461
look after these fine lads.

06:28.763 --> 06:30.030
I'm going to go
wait in the truck.

06:30.032 --> 06:32.865
Cool, uh, let me grab a quick rinse,
then we'll head, okay?

06:32.867 --> 06:34.701
- Man Camp!
- Man Camp!

06:34.703 --> 06:38.174
So, uh, is Katie
staying home alone?

06:38.807 --> 06:40.977
Hey bud, why don't you
rinse off when we get there?

06:41.810 --> 06:43.177
I'm going to get out of here.

06:43.179 --> 06:46.013
So you, uh, planning
on graduating anytime soon?

06:46.015 --> 06:48.581
Or are you just going to kind of hang out,
become the next-door

06:48.583 --> 06:50.317
- dude perving on people's family pictures?
- Come on, dude.

06:50.319 --> 06:52.952
What do you mean "come on?"
That guy was fricking perving on Katie.

06:52.954 --> 06:55.222
Everyone pervs on Katie,
dude, it's the circle of life.

06:55.224 --> 06:58.691
Every... so you perv on Katie,
that's something you do?

06:58.693 --> 07:02.262
She had, like, a baby last year,
so obviously not lately,

07:02.264 --> 07:03.763
that'd be
pretty messed up, dude.

07:03.765 --> 07:06.035
Besides, she family's on me.

07:07.269 --> 07:09.003
- Brewski?
- I'm driving.

07:09.005 --> 07:11.271
- Right, stick shift.
- I don't know, man.

07:11.273 --> 07:13.706
All this partying,
drinking nonstop,

07:13.708 --> 07:15.009
different girl every week.

07:15.011 --> 07:16.642
At some point you're
going to have to grow up.

07:16.644 --> 07:18.745
What, so I can get
it together like you?

07:18.747 --> 07:21.881
Get a wife, kid, sell like two
cars a month, pay taxes and shit?

07:21.883 --> 07:24.018
It must be pretty lonely
on the top of that mountain.

07:24.020 --> 07:25.752
You don't pay taxes?

07:25.754 --> 07:28.188
I don't know, Dad,
let me check with my accountant.

07:28.190 --> 07:29.922
Hello, Mr. Steinberg's office.

07:29.924 --> 07:31.924
- Yeah, I'll hold.
- Dude, don't be a dick.

07:31.926 --> 07:34.328
Fake out, dude!
It's not even a real phone, bro.

07:34.330 --> 07:36.263
Mom told me you
were an accident.

07:36.265 --> 07:40.800
Well, um, life, uh...

07:40.802 --> 07:41.903
Finds a way.

07:56.118 --> 07:57.685
Mom?

07:59.988 --> 08:01.155
Mom, we're home!

08:03.858 --> 08:05.159
I don't see Kevin's GoPed.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.228
He's living in
the garage, right?

08:08.230 --> 08:10.698
Hey, Kev, bud?

08:12.134 --> 08:13.735
Kev?

08:15.837 --> 08:16.938
Where the hell is everybody?

08:28.284 --> 08:29.782
Brave warrior Bill,

08:29.784 --> 08:31.385
you must journey to
the Forbidden Mountain

08:31.387 --> 08:35.054
and save my father from
the shadows of the Dark Lord.

08:35.056 --> 08:40.162
I will, my lady, and when I return I
shall ask for your hand in marriage.

08:42.030 --> 08:45.667
And at that time you
shall have your true reward.

08:48.270 --> 08:50.239
The Mighty Ax of Kabazaduil.

08:51.240 --> 08:53.407
Bro, wake up dipshit!

08:53.409 --> 08:54.374
My lady?

08:54.376 --> 08:57.444
- Kevin, hello, it's Tim!
- Tim?

08:57.446 --> 09:00.114
- Is he on drugs or something?
- Let's try his, that language that he knows.

09:02.016 --> 09:04.418
I don't actually know the
language, I don't actually know.

09:08.723 --> 09:11.691
Kevin, Kevin, wake up.

09:11.693 --> 09:13.427
He hasn't gotten
any better at drawing.

09:13.429 --> 09:16.097
Kevin, wake up,
dude. Hey, Kev.

09:18.900 --> 09:19.968
Hey, bros.

09:21.102 --> 09:25.938
I... To what do I... I owe
this... prestigious pleasure?

09:25.940 --> 09:27.209
It's Man Camp week, dude.

09:28.042 --> 09:30.210
It's Man Camp...
it's Man Camp weekend?

09:30.212 --> 09:33.913
Sure, uh, sure, yeah.
Totes, totes knew that.

09:33.915 --> 09:35.650
Yeah, is... is Mom around?

09:36.418 --> 09:41.120
Actually, mom... Mom is, uh,
let me check the planner.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.325
Oh, she said...

09:45.093 --> 09:48.297
Um, yes. See, a work retreat.

09:49.764 --> 09:50.830
A work retreat?

09:50.832 --> 09:53.500
Uh, yeah, something
about team building exercises.

09:53.502 --> 09:56.403
For her business that
she owns herself,

09:56.405 --> 09:58.104
and she doesn't
have any employees?

09:58.106 --> 09:59.173
Mm-hmm.

09:59.175 --> 10:00.174
She wasn't worried at all

10:00.176 --> 10:02.108
about missing us on
her way up to the cabin?

10:02.110 --> 10:04.411
Yeah, well, I'm sure she'll be
here when we get back, so

10:04.413 --> 10:06.213
we'll see her then to say hi.

10:06.215 --> 10:07.314
So, how is it man?

10:07.316 --> 10:10.419
All moved in back at home,
is it, uh, pretty nice?

10:11.119 --> 10:12.084
Epic.

10:12.086 --> 10:13.187
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it's sweet.

10:13.189 --> 10:15.389
Um, you know, other than that

10:15.391 --> 10:17.125
I'm just killing it
at college right now.

10:18.092 --> 10:19.058
Five year plan.

10:19.060 --> 10:20.394
I thought, uh, online college

10:20.396 --> 10:21.896
was like a less than
two year kind of thing.

10:23.332 --> 10:25.299
Yeah, if you're intellectually
inferior and only want one degree.

10:25.301 --> 10:29.902
I have four already,
so we got philosophy,

10:29.904 --> 10:34.006
astrophysics, quantum
mechanics, and home economics.

10:34.008 --> 10:36.343
Wow, is... is Mom paying or?

10:36.345 --> 10:38.177
I'm going to stop you there.
Uh, she will be reimbursed.

10:38.179 --> 10:42.148
It's all part of,
you know, five year plan, so.

10:42.150 --> 10:43.250
You got a job then or?

10:43.252 --> 10:46.453
Yeah, I started my own
business actually, distribution.

10:46.455 --> 10:48.020
Of what?

10:48.022 --> 10:50.122
Uh, just like,
beer, wine, spirits.

10:50.124 --> 10:52.426
Oh, you're a liquor rep
for, uh, for who?

10:52.428 --> 10:55.229
People that can't get it themselves,
like they're either too young

10:55.231 --> 10:57.196
or not old enough,

10:57.198 --> 10:59.999
or in a lot of cases they're just
born later than they should've been.

11:00.001 --> 11:01.501
Kevin, that's illegal, bud.

11:01.503 --> 11:04.170
Where does it say
that in the Constitution?

11:04.172 --> 11:08.475
Because this is America and
last I checked I'm American, so.

11:08.477 --> 11:11.445
You're selling
alcohol to children, Kevin.

11:11.447 --> 11:13.247
Well, they identify as adults,

11:13.249 --> 11:16.352
so, jeez, that's insensitive.

11:17.151 --> 11:19.919
Hey, isn't this guy in jail for running
an illegal cat fighting ring or something?

11:19.921 --> 11:22.389
Cats?

11:22.391 --> 11:23.856
No, rabbits actually.

11:23.858 --> 11:25.394
It's way higher net revenue.

11:28.096 --> 11:28.961
Tim?

11:28.963 --> 11:30.129
Shit, it's
Christy Borders, hide me.

11:30.131 --> 11:33.167
Tim, is that you? Hey, guys,
it's been, like, forever.

11:33.968 --> 11:36.869
Tim, you look all grown up.

11:36.871 --> 11:40.407
What's up? Hey, Christy, we, uh,
we were just about to leave, so.

11:40.409 --> 11:43.510
Oh, yeah? Where are you guys...
oh, your little Min Camp.

11:43.512 --> 11:46.382
- It's called Man Camp.
- She's the worst.

11:47.949 --> 11:51.917
Uh, you know, Tim, I was
cleaning out my closet recently,

11:51.919 --> 11:54.956
and, uh, found that love poem
you wrote me. Do you remember?

11:55.424 --> 11:57.591
- Nope.
- Oh, come on, yeah, you do.

11:57.593 --> 11:59.493
You wrote it in eighth grade
to ask me to prom,

11:59.495 --> 12:01.994
and you titled it, like,
"Sexy Poem."

12:01.996 --> 12:03.330
It sounds like a fake poem.

12:03.332 --> 12:05.567
Well, it's real
and I found it, um...

12:06.901 --> 12:09.405
kind of bummed I didn't say
yes seeing as how you grew up.

12:10.104 --> 12:13.207
Well, uh, you didn't
so, sucks for you I guess.

12:15.943 --> 12:20.281
Yeah, um, well,
you guys enjoy your "Man Camp."

12:22.584 --> 12:23.983
Bye, Tim.

12:23.985 --> 12:25.521
Really nice to see you, Christy.

12:26.655 --> 12:28.455
What's your deal with her, dude?

12:28.457 --> 12:30.657
You used to be obsessed
with her when we were kids.

12:30.659 --> 12:33.192
Now you actually have a shot,
and you're being a total douche.

12:33.194 --> 12:36.130
Well, now she has
wooden teeth, okay? Hard pass.

12:36.665 --> 12:38.332
Come on, let's go.

12:38.334 --> 12:39.535
The ice, put it in.

12:43.572 --> 12:45.439
Did you guys see the
way she was flirting with me?

13:19.073 --> 13:21.040
What can I
get you fine gentlemen

13:21.042 --> 13:22.975
this glorious post morning?

13:22.977 --> 13:23.779
Post.

13:25.246 --> 13:27.581
Uh, where's Sam?
He's never not here.

13:27.583 --> 13:30.584
Ah, yes, our proprietor
is currently indisposed.

13:30.586 --> 13:32.386
And he left you in charge?

13:32.388 --> 13:34.122
They call me Kurt.

13:34.656 --> 13:35.822
I got to take a piss.

13:35.824 --> 13:38.324
Great, uh, Kurt, can we
just get four bourbons, please.

13:38.326 --> 13:39.459
Straight up.

13:39.461 --> 13:42.161
You don't want that.
Allow me to delight your senses

13:42.163 --> 13:45.364
with my self-authored specialty.

13:45.366 --> 13:49.235
Including handcrafted bitters,
which I crafted myself, with my hands.

13:49.237 --> 13:52.506
Uh, yeah, no, no specials,
just the four bourbons, please.

13:52.508 --> 13:56.144
Actually that sounds delightful,
I'll try one of those. On the house.

13:57.311 --> 13:58.745
Kevin, it's tradition.

13:58.747 --> 14:01.013
Four bourbons, nothing else.

14:01.015 --> 14:03.282
And you can't order
things on the house.

14:03.284 --> 14:04.653
One Kurt Special on the house.

14:09.257 --> 14:10.322
It's delicious.

14:10.324 --> 14:11.558
Okay, you know what?

14:11.560 --> 14:13.225
Just the four bourbons, please.

14:13.227 --> 14:14.530
Straight up, nothing else.

14:15.930 --> 14:19.165
I don't know what's happening
to this place, but I don't like it.

14:19.167 --> 14:22.236
- Whiskey <i>au gelatin.</i>
- Oh, come on.

14:23.739 --> 14:26.675
- It's Jello shots.
- Whatever. Um...

14:29.143 --> 14:30.077
To Dad.

14:31.145 --> 14:33.715
To Dad.

14:34.750 --> 14:36.017
Really?

14:45.026 --> 14:47.328
- We're not paying for this.
- You should be ashamed of yourself.

15:01.309 --> 15:02.410
Let's do this.

15:11.753 --> 15:13.387
I can still feel
him up here, you know?

15:14.723 --> 15:15.657
Me too.

15:16.658 --> 15:20.361
Or the altitude,
but I'm pretty sure it's Dad.

15:21.229 --> 15:22.562
Enough with the
ghost stories, boys.

15:22.564 --> 15:24.432
These beers aren't
going to drink themselves.

15:53.294 --> 15:54.228
Mom?

15:55.864 --> 15:57.164
Mom!

15:58.399 --> 15:59.699
Mom!

16:01.469 --> 16:03.603
Adam, oh, my God!

16:03.605 --> 16:05.106
Why are you naked?

16:05.874 --> 16:07.206
You should never be nude, Mom.

16:07.208 --> 16:10.276
Timmy, I am not naked.

16:10.278 --> 16:13.145
Oh, hey, Mom.
How's the work retreat going?

16:13.147 --> 16:14.248
Oh, no, Kevin!

16:15.651 --> 16:18.150
- What are you all even doing up here?
- What are you doing here?

16:18.152 --> 16:19.518
It's Man Camp week.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.620
It's this weekend?

16:20.622 --> 16:22.488
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit!

16:22.490 --> 16:26.525
Okay, fine, I'll, uh...
I'll just gather my things up.

16:26.527 --> 16:29.461
I forgot that it was this...

16:29.463 --> 16:34.300
Sometimes a woman just needs
some special time

16:34.302 --> 16:36.201
- alone to herself to...
- Oh, God, Mom, no!

16:36.203 --> 16:38.537
Gross! No explanation
necessary, please.

16:38.539 --> 16:39.906
Don't be such a
little bitch, Adam.

16:39.908 --> 16:41.808
Explanation fully necessary.

16:41.810 --> 16:44.711
So, you're just here by yourself
having special time then?

16:44.713 --> 16:46.880
Yes, yes.

16:48.884 --> 16:51.618
I hear there's a few logs

16:51.620 --> 16:54.486
that need to be
split in this here woods.

16:54.488 --> 16:56.590
Oh!

16:56.592 --> 17:00.762
Oh, oh, I, uh, wow.

17:02.898 --> 17:06.231
I was just, uh,
getting some wood.

17:06.233 --> 17:10.770
No, I, it's so nice
to actually meet you guys.

17:12.840 --> 17:15.209
Hi!

17:16.811 --> 17:18.112
Um.

17:19.446 --> 17:21.547
You must be... Oh.

17:21.549 --> 17:23.415
- Tim.
- We can talk this through.

17:23.416 --> 17:24.818
Tim. Tim.

17:24.819 --> 17:27.623
- Mister, g...
- No, no, no, I, we should...

17:28.388 --> 17:29.388
Tim, Tim, Tim!

17:29.390 --> 17:31.625
Go! Grab him! Run!

17:31.627 --> 17:32.859
- Stop it!
- Run!

17:34.528 --> 17:36.528
Tim! Stop that!

17:36.530 --> 17:39.365
Stop it!

17:53.849 --> 17:55.383
- Um...
- Shh!

18:01.690 --> 18:06.325
Maybe... some
introductions are in order.

18:06.327 --> 18:07.894
Well, now that's
a great idea, Kevin.

18:07.896 --> 18:09.731
Okay, I'm Alan.

18:11.667 --> 18:15.702
Uh, guys, guys,
relax, just chill, bros.

18:15.704 --> 18:19.438
Um, you know, maybe I can,
do you mind if I?

18:19.440 --> 18:22.410
I... I think I can
explain what's going on here.

18:23.779 --> 18:26.614
Mom and Alan are friends...

18:27.749 --> 18:31.885
who apparently work together
since Alan is here on the work retreat.

18:31.887 --> 18:33.452
- It's not a work retreat.
- Nothing going on here.

18:33.454 --> 18:35.955
It's just,
it's just two work friends

18:35.957 --> 18:37.658
doing what
work friends do, you know?

18:38.492 --> 18:42.394
Riding work bikes and
going to the movies for work,

18:42.396 --> 18:45.799
or going to
fancy work restaurants.

18:45.801 --> 18:48.768
You know, or
having work sleepovers.

18:48.770 --> 18:52.606
- You know, or all night work wrestling matches.
- Kevin.

18:53.541 --> 18:54.575
It's just work.

18:55.711 --> 18:56.910
Dude, you know this guy?

18:56.912 --> 18:58.778
- Who, Alan?
- Yeah!

18:58.780 --> 19:01.382
Yeah, of course. What's up, Alan?

19:02.450 --> 19:04.483
Mom, what the
hell is going on here?

19:04.485 --> 19:05.486
Boys, look.

19:06.487 --> 19:08.689
I've been wanting to
talk to you for a while.

19:10.691 --> 19:11.927
I've met someone.

19:12.660 --> 19:14.896
What the hell do you
mean you've met someone?

19:15.696 --> 19:18.064
Well, Tim, is it?

19:18.066 --> 19:19.833
When a man loves a woman...

19:19.835 --> 19:21.901
I know exactly what happens
when a man loves a woman,

19:21.903 --> 19:23.702
and it sure as hell
better not be happening

19:23.704 --> 19:25.839
outside the boundaries
of holy matrimony!

19:25.841 --> 19:28.742
Now, Tim, I think you need
to see the whole picture here.

19:28.744 --> 19:29.976
Whole picture?

19:29.978 --> 19:33.612
This isn't just about
physical stuff going on,

19:33.614 --> 19:35.683
and believe me,
that is going on.

19:36.584 --> 19:37.951
I think what I'm trying to say

19:37.953 --> 19:41.755
is that sometimes
there's more to the story, okay?

19:41.757 --> 19:44.057
And what more to
story is there, Alan?

19:44.059 --> 19:47.595
It... There's nothing.
It... It's nothing.

19:48.329 --> 19:50.899
- What he's trying to say...
- No, no, honey.

19:51.900 --> 19:54.067
Bless you, but I know
what I'm trying to say.

19:54.069 --> 19:57.436
I want you boys to know that
I'm a man of good intentions,

19:57.438 --> 19:59.873
and I think that
if you boys understand

19:59.875 --> 20:01.908
where this is
going with your Mom and I,

20:01.910 --> 20:03.642
we can smooth
this whole thing over.

20:03.644 --> 20:04.911
Where things are going?

20:04.913 --> 20:08.415
That's... That's great, it sounds
like you're planning a wedding.

20:13.454 --> 20:14.555
Oh, shit.

20:16.024 --> 20:17.358
What do you want me to say?

20:19.027 --> 20:20.860
Okay, okay, so I guess...

20:20.862 --> 20:23.762
I guess whatever we
think about all this is just,

20:23.764 --> 20:26.467
who gives a shit
what we think about it. Wow.

20:26.968 --> 20:28.602
I've got news
for you, young man.

20:29.403 --> 20:33.505
I am 54 years old and
I think I am perfectly capable

20:33.507 --> 20:35.407
of making a decision by myself,

20:35.409 --> 20:37.944
and if you think you should've
been included in that decision,

20:37.946 --> 20:41.547
well, I'm sorry,
I am, but I love this man.

20:41.549 --> 20:43.582
- I love you too, Ther.
- Not now, babe.

20:43.584 --> 20:46.752
I love him and I wanted to
wait to discuss it with you boys

20:46.754 --> 20:48.453
until I saw that it was serious.

20:48.455 --> 20:50.522
I can't imagine why I was
so nervous,

20:50.524 --> 20:52.926
because you also
clearly have the ability

20:52.928 --> 20:54.595
to handle
things like mature adults.

20:54.996 --> 20:58.697
And if I hear you talk
to me in that language again,

20:58.699 --> 21:01.000
I'm going to wash
your mouth out with bleach,

21:01.002 --> 21:03.504
- do you understand?
- I'm a grown ass man.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.174
God, okay, Mom, Mom!

21:08.176 --> 21:10.442
Okay, jeez.

21:10.444 --> 21:12.078
So, this is what
you wanted all along?

21:12.080 --> 21:13.480
You just got stuck with Dad?

21:14.782 --> 21:16.817
How dare you!

21:31.565 --> 21:34.468
We always have s'mores
the first night, is that not?

21:48.582 --> 21:49.650
Hey, brother.

21:50.986 --> 21:52.020
You need a push?

21:53.088 --> 21:55.554
Judas! How long have you
known about this, Kevin?

21:55.556 --> 22:00.692
Um, phew,
eight months and a half.

22:00.694 --> 22:01.961
Maybe nine.

22:01.963 --> 22:04.563
Nine months? Are they doing it?

22:04.565 --> 22:05.631
Doing what?

22:05.633 --> 22:07.967
It, sex, intercourse!

22:07.969 --> 22:11.737
I couldn't say for sure,
but, yes, definitely.

22:11.739 --> 22:13.839
You piece of human shit.

22:13.841 --> 22:15.707
Why didn't you tell
us this was going on?

22:15.709 --> 22:17.843
Because Mom seemed happy.

22:17.845 --> 22:19.747
I mean, the happiest
I've ever seen her.

22:20.714 --> 22:23.851
You know,
since everything happened.

22:24.652 --> 22:26.718
And I knew you guys
would just lose your minds, so.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.587
- You don't know that, dude.
- I do, I do know that!

22:28.589 --> 22:31.991
Father Flynn, you planted
drugs on him because you thought

22:31.993 --> 22:34.928
he hugged Mom for too long
at Christmas Eve service.

22:34.930 --> 22:36.795
He's never hugged me that long.

22:36.797 --> 22:39.134
And Alan is, he's not that bad.

22:39.900 --> 22:43.769
You know, he can't
play baseball or fix a truck,

22:43.771 --> 22:45.771
or play pranks as good
as Dad could,

22:45.773 --> 22:48.575
but you know,
he's been really nice to me.

22:53.081 --> 22:54.983
Yeah, he probably doesn't have
Dad's sense of humor, does he?

22:56.217 --> 22:58.852
He's probably a little
more emotionally fragile, yeah?

23:00.088 --> 23:02.221
Uh, well, you know,
he did submit

23:02.223 --> 23:05.224
this really thoughtful gardening
plan to Reader's Digest.

23:05.226 --> 23:06.527
Kevin, get in the truck.

23:07.128 --> 23:08.629
We're going to need supplies.

23:12.833 --> 23:17.103
I am so glad that this is
now my top memory of this place.

23:17.105 --> 23:19.040
Really, I'm thrilled about it.

23:19.673 --> 23:21.540
God knows what else
has been going on up here.

23:21.542 --> 23:24.143
Right, Adam,
and I'm just the town...

23:24.145 --> 23:25.512
What?

23:27.815 --> 23:29.815
- Bicycle.
- Bicycle?

23:29.817 --> 23:31.550
Everyone goes for a ride on me.

23:31.552 --> 23:32.617
Oh, gosh, Mom.

23:32.619 --> 23:34.020
Sweetie, don't say that.

23:34.022 --> 23:37.825
I made you some chamomile
to calm you down.

23:38.994 --> 23:39.927
I'll get you one.

23:41.129 --> 23:42.230
Listen, Mom.

23:43.398 --> 23:47.133
I'm not saying that you're
some kind of... whore, okay?

23:47.135 --> 23:49.935
I'm just, you have to
understand this is hard for us.

23:49.937 --> 23:51.603
This guy could be
anybody for all we know.

23:51.605 --> 23:54.040
He, he, he could
be a serial killer.

23:54.042 --> 23:57.176
He could be a rapist. He could
be a registered sex offender.

23:57.178 --> 24:00.645
- Careful, it's hot.
- Thanks, but I'm pretty sure I saw a guy

24:00.647 --> 24:02.916
that looked a lot like
him on <i>To Catch a Predator.</i>

24:06.720 --> 24:08.956
Oh, I've got folding to do.

24:10.958 --> 24:12.559
These people
are out there.

24:14.195 --> 24:16.262
- Oh, that's hot.
- Told you!

24:16.264 --> 24:18.966
Alan is not a predator,
don't be silly!

24:19.767 --> 24:21.034
You know, I am sorry.

24:21.036 --> 24:22.734
I don't want
you to be sorry, Mom.

24:22.736 --> 24:24.903
I want you to act like
you give a shit what we think.

24:24.905 --> 24:28.006
Hey, hey, mister. Watch the language.
Your mother already mentioned that.

24:28.008 --> 24:29.308
Oh, oh, okay,

24:29.310 --> 24:32.378
so I can't come to
my Dad's cabin and say "shit",

24:32.380 --> 24:34.147
but you're
fully welcome to come here

24:34.149 --> 24:36.615
with no freaking pants on
and take care of quote,

24:36.617 --> 24:38.683
"A log that needs splitting."

24:38.685 --> 24:39.885
I don't even know
what that means, man.

24:39.887 --> 24:41.220
That was a
flirtatious expression...

24:41.222 --> 24:44.357
- My mom is not a log!
- Honey, please!

24:44.359 --> 24:46.725
I know this is hard on you.

24:46.727 --> 24:49.362
Why do you think we were afraid
to tell you guys in the first place?

24:49.364 --> 24:50.562
Look how you boys are acting!

24:50.564 --> 24:53.033
It's like having two clones
of your father in this room.

24:55.170 --> 24:56.703
We're still a family, Mom.

24:58.073 --> 24:59.174
Even if Dad's gone.

25:00.941 --> 25:02.042
Yes, we are.

25:04.212 --> 25:06.878
And I'm still a person
with a life,

25:06.880 --> 25:09.182
and I deserve to have
someone to share it with.

25:11.785 --> 25:14.089
I'd give anything to
have your father back.

25:15.223 --> 25:17.158
But that's not going to happen.

25:18.725 --> 25:20.761
It's time you
boys understood that.

25:26.334 --> 25:27.601
I need some air.

26:03.103 --> 26:06.705
Thanks for sticking around to
back me up. I appreciate it.

26:06.707 --> 26:08.307
Don't worry about it,
everything's under control.

26:08.309 --> 26:11.076
No, it's not, dude. I can't stand this guy,
he needs to go.

26:11.078 --> 26:12.347
Way ahead of you, pal.

26:17.885 --> 26:18.917
Can I help you?

26:18.919 --> 26:20.153
No, no, I've got it.

26:20.155 --> 26:21.953
This is kind of my thing.

26:25.426 --> 26:26.827
I'm so sorry, Mom.

26:27.928 --> 26:29.963
- You are?
- Yeah.

26:31.432 --> 26:34.167
You know me,
I always go overboard.

26:34.169 --> 26:37.070
I mean, it's like zero to 60
in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

26:40.408 --> 26:42.443
I love you.

26:46.146 --> 26:47.346
What are you up to, Timmy?

26:47.348 --> 26:48.548
Am I upset?

26:48.550 --> 26:52.851
Yes, but does that mean that
I don't want you to be happy

26:52.853 --> 26:54.220
and find some love in your life?

26:54.222 --> 26:56.154
I mean, come on.

26:56.156 --> 26:58.025
I'm not a monster.

27:00.093 --> 27:01.394
Let us make it up to you.

27:01.396 --> 27:03.828
It's all right.
Alan and I are going to go.

27:03.830 --> 27:05.897
You guys have a great weekend

27:05.899 --> 27:07.366
and we can talk
about this another time.

27:07.368 --> 27:10.403
There's no time
like the present, okay?

27:10.405 --> 27:12.438
Now, the boys and I
have a proposition,

27:12.440 --> 27:14.105
and I think you'll
find it very appealing.

27:14.107 --> 27:15.508
What?

27:15.510 --> 27:18.244
Well, you go home
for the weekend, okay?

27:18.246 --> 27:22.049
Hang out with your girlfriends, paint
your toenails, watch a little Gilly Girls.

27:22.550 --> 27:25.384
And, uh, we'll hang up here with Alan, just the boys.

27:25.386 --> 27:27.320
Okay, just
really get a real chance

27:27.322 --> 27:30.258
to really get to know the
real Alan, Man Camp plus one.

27:31.392 --> 27:32.293
Really?

27:32.926 --> 27:35.195
Um, uh...

27:36.063 --> 27:38.464
Yes, yes, yep.

27:38.466 --> 27:40.466
Perfect, so
we're all in agreement.

27:40.468 --> 27:42.934
- Uh, I, I don't think so.
- What?

27:42.936 --> 27:46.405
- You have that look in your eye.
- What look?

27:46.407 --> 27:49.207
The look that before you
burned the neighbor's shed down,

27:49.209 --> 27:52.077
or you buried their
cat for meowing at night,

27:52.079 --> 27:55.013
- oh, and when you booby trapped the teacher's lounge.
- Mom, Mom!

27:55.015 --> 27:57.383
That look.

27:57.385 --> 28:01.121
Mom, that was old Tim, okay?
This is new Tim.

28:02.155 --> 28:07.125
That's sweet, honey,
but, um, Alan has some work

28:07.127 --> 28:09.194
that he's just
got to get back to.

28:09.196 --> 28:12.030
Honey, no, no, no.
I can reschedule that.

28:12.032 --> 28:14.232
Yeah, you know, honestly,
I think this is a great idea.

28:14.234 --> 28:17.035
There you go, Al, buddy.

28:17.037 --> 28:18.103
Well. Oh!

28:18.105 --> 28:19.904
You won't regret this.

28:19.906 --> 28:23.476
Hey, hey, hey, I know we came on
a little strong up there, okay?

28:23.478 --> 28:25.411
- At the top.
- Just a little bit.

28:25.413 --> 28:27.981
- And for that, I apologize.
- Oh.

28:28.416 --> 28:33.352
And Kev says you're a
stand-up guy, so I trust my brother.

28:33.354 --> 28:35.020
Let's try this again.

28:35.022 --> 28:36.254
Welcome to Man Camp.

28:36.256 --> 28:37.922
Well, thank you, New Tim.

28:37.924 --> 28:39.257
I appreciate it.
Oh, that's good.

28:39.259 --> 28:42.528
- I'm glad to have a new start and hit to old reset button.
- Yeah.

28:42.530 --> 28:45.096
And just have a
little man on man time.

28:45.098 --> 28:48.166
- What's that?
- Oh, you know, break down some barriers.

28:48.168 --> 28:51.304
Just get going guy on guy,
I think it sounds amazing,

28:51.306 --> 28:52.137
and you know what?

28:52.139 --> 28:53.639
You've got
nothing to worry about,

28:53.641 --> 28:54.707
because all we're
going to be doing up here

28:54.709 --> 28:59.044
is just a couple of
guys taking it nice and deep.

28:59.046 --> 29:00.178
I can't wait.

29:03.618 --> 29:08.153
So, I guess I'm going to have to split that log another time.

29:08.155 --> 29:10.389
Stop!

29:10.391 --> 29:13.024
Well, this is all going to be fine.
It's going to be okay, trust me.

29:13.026 --> 29:15.594
Oh, you poor, poor sweet man.

29:15.596 --> 29:17.630
- Oh!
- All right, all set.

29:17.632 --> 29:21.032
Okay, um, I'll call you
when I get home, okay?

29:21.034 --> 29:23.469
- Oh, please do, sweetie.
- Drive safe, Mom.

29:23.471 --> 29:27.205
- It's gonna be scary at night.
- Oh, oh, hey, you guys be good to him.

29:27.207 --> 29:30.643
He's not used to these
sort of situations, okay?

29:30.645 --> 29:34.848
- We'll take care of him, Mom.
- Okay, oh, my sweet boys. Oh.

29:36.016 --> 29:38.116
- All right.
- Oh, okay, okay.

29:38.118 --> 29:39.618
- Drive safe, Mom.
- Okay.

29:39.620 --> 29:41.186
Don't you worry about a thing.

29:41.188 --> 29:42.388
When we come
down off of this mountain,

29:42.390 --> 29:43.689
we're going to be
like peas and carrots.

29:43.691 --> 29:47.560
- Aw, I love you, babe.
- Oh.

29:47.562 --> 29:49.127
- Bye!
- Bye, Mom.

29:49.129 --> 29:51.162
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye!

29:53.200 --> 29:55.934
Well, boys, here we go, ooh.

29:55.936 --> 29:57.068
- Hey, buddy.
- Oh.

29:57.070 --> 29:58.537
You ready to spend some
quality time with the boys?

29:58.539 --> 30:00.271
Oh, yeah.

30:00.273 --> 30:03.074
I just had a
ruptured disc, I think.

30:03.076 --> 30:04.543
Oh, my gosh, yeah, I can feel

30:04.545 --> 30:07.646
those little pieces
floating around in my back skin.

30:07.648 --> 30:08.980
I can't breathe really.

30:08.982 --> 30:09.782
I think he's telling the truth.

30:09.784 --> 30:11.550
His face looks
really fat and tight.

30:11.552 --> 30:13.318
Oh, no, that's just
what his face looks like.

30:13.320 --> 30:16.988
- No, okay, please.
- Okay.

30:16.990 --> 30:19.991
- Oh.
- Just a little brotherly wrestling with you, Alan.

30:19.993 --> 30:21.928
It's going to be a good
weekend up here.

30:22.530 --> 30:24.030
I can't wait to just hang out
and see what you're all about.

30:25.198 --> 30:26.965
Well, hang on,
are you winking to them

30:26.967 --> 30:28.099
to surreptitiously suggest

30:28.101 --> 30:30.034
that you're not going to
have a good weekend with me?

30:30.036 --> 30:32.438
Don't be silly, Alvis.

30:32.440 --> 30:34.607
I've got something in my eye.

30:34.609 --> 30:37.242
Oh, you know what? I think you
actually do have something in your eye.

30:38.345 --> 30:42.280
- Oh, very good, Kevin!
- Not the time for magic, Kevin.

30:42.282 --> 30:45.686
Hey, Kevin, I think I
might have a quarter in my eye.

30:46.286 --> 30:48.153
I don't see
anything in your eye.

30:48.155 --> 30:49.522
Maybe if I check into... oh!

30:49.524 --> 30:51.222
Oh, come on.

30:51.224 --> 30:52.591
Did you hear what
I just said, Alvin?

30:52.593 --> 30:54.259
Actually, it's Alan.

30:54.261 --> 30:55.663
Sure thing, Alice.

30:56.329 --> 30:58.196
Oh, I get it.

30:58.198 --> 31:01.099
You like to give each
other a little smack down, huh?

31:01.101 --> 31:03.536
Kind of razz the bros,
well, I totally dig that.

31:03.538 --> 31:06.204
Yeah, I dig it. I dig it with both shovels,
but I'll tell you something,

31:06.206 --> 31:09.376
you better watch out,
because four can play that game.

31:10.277 --> 31:15.248
Like, hey, you
little weirdo wankers.

31:16.316 --> 31:17.716
Buncha weirdo wankers.

31:17.718 --> 31:19.317
Don't tell your mother
I said that.

31:19.319 --> 31:21.286
It's a good thing no one can
hear you way up here.

31:21.288 --> 31:22.954
Away from the modern world.

31:22.956 --> 31:26.659
You could scream your lungs out and no one
would hear you but the wind and the trees.

31:26.661 --> 31:29.628
You know, Tim, that kind
of came across as a threat.

31:29.630 --> 31:32.397
The imagination on this one.

31:32.399 --> 31:33.668
Let's get you situated.

31:34.469 --> 31:37.135
Hey, are there any
more sleeping options?

31:37.137 --> 31:38.671
Because I know there
are bedrooms downstairs,

31:38.673 --> 31:40.673
and also I need
to use the potty.

31:40.675 --> 31:41.709
Outhouse is over there.

31:42.610 --> 31:43.709
Goodnight, baby bear.

31:53.721 --> 31:56.120
All right,
boys, homewrecker's all tucked in.

31:56.122 --> 31:57.523
Great, so what's the plan?

31:57.525 --> 31:59.525
Now this guy's
staying up here for Man Camp?

31:59.527 --> 32:01.359
Dad would not be happy, dude.

32:01.361 --> 32:02.495
Obviously Dad would be pissed

32:02.497 --> 32:05.129
about Mom knocking boots
with Small Bunyan out there.

32:05.131 --> 32:08.299
Okay, that guy is ugly, weak
as shit, and probably racist.

32:08.301 --> 32:11.537
He... He teaches African American
Studies at the community college.

32:11.539 --> 32:12.705
Classic racist cover-up, Kevin.

32:12.707 --> 32:14.205
You're avoiding
the question, man.

32:14.207 --> 32:15.841
Why the hell did
you invite him up here?

32:15.843 --> 32:17.510
We could've at least
had a decent weekend,

32:17.512 --> 32:18.744
but now that's out the window.

32:18.746 --> 32:20.113
Bro, trust.

32:21.281 --> 32:24.082
After this weekend, you'll
never have to see him again.

32:24.084 --> 32:25.118
I give you...

32:36.263 --> 32:37.598
the master plan.

32:39.366 --> 32:43.201
Mom's on her way home now,
confident everything is cool.

32:43.203 --> 32:45.538
Now, while she has a
nice little weekend to herself,

32:45.540 --> 32:48.809
we keep that dong bag up
here and let the games begin.

32:49.442 --> 32:50.576
You made this?

32:50.578 --> 32:51.777
Yeah, dude,
I'm not a kindergartner.

32:51.779 --> 32:53.111
I know basic cartography.

32:53.113 --> 32:54.747
Oh, are those ninja stars?

32:54.749 --> 32:56.582
Shuriken, read the legend.

32:56.584 --> 32:58.516
Oh, hey, that guy's
falling off a cliff.

32:58.518 --> 33:00.487
This guy's just on fire. We're
going to light him on fire?

33:01.488 --> 33:04.122
What do you think
I am, a psychopath?

33:04.124 --> 33:05.624
He'll be
setting himself on fire,

33:05.626 --> 33:07.425
which you would know
if you read the legend.

33:07.427 --> 33:11.162
Whoa, whoa, whoa. This guy on fire,
that's supposed to be Alan?

33:11.164 --> 33:12.633
- Yeah.
- Oh, no.

33:13.433 --> 33:16.702
Uh-uh, no, I'm sorry,
change of allegiance, Tim.

33:16.704 --> 33:19.537
Thanks, Kevin, yeah,
we're not torturing this guy.

33:19.539 --> 33:21.607
But thank you for
ruining this entire weekend

33:21.609 --> 33:23.174
because of your
stupid little plan.

33:23.176 --> 33:25.243
So, you'd rather it just
be the three of us up here?

33:25.245 --> 33:29.615
While he's down in our house
touching our mom? Dad's Mom?

33:29.617 --> 33:33.251
Dude, I'm not a bigger fan of this guy
than you are, but we need a real plan.

33:33.253 --> 33:34.653
You're acting as
if I didn't create

33:34.655 --> 33:37.388
an incredibly detailed map
for that very purpose!

33:37.390 --> 33:39.190
Are you even aware
of what's at stake here?

33:39.192 --> 33:41.062
Kevin, tell him
what you told me.

33:41.662 --> 33:44.195
The only place
a dream becomes impossible

33:44.197 --> 33:45.600
is in your own mind.

33:47.233 --> 33:48.703
About Mom and Alan.

33:49.569 --> 33:53.506
Oh, um, they...
they love each other.

33:54.474 --> 33:55.643
And how do they love each other?

33:57.544 --> 33:59.210
In the sheets.

33:59.212 --> 34:00.012
Thank you.

34:00.014 --> 34:02.681
- Well...
- Sometimes on the couch.

34:02.683 --> 34:04.783
Kevin, got it. Kind of
put two and two together

34:04.785 --> 34:07.418
when we walked in on Mom spread
eagle on the bearskin rug.

34:07.420 --> 34:08.585
Dad's bearskin rug.

34:08.588 --> 34:10.856
Dad's Mom's bearskin rug.

34:10.858 --> 34:12.489
Tim, I'm not going to jail again

34:12.492 --> 34:15.228
for another one of your stupid
little plans. Goodnight.

34:16.831 --> 34:19.397
Hey, I'm
starting to get the feeling

34:19.399 --> 34:21.565
you don't care about
defending Mom's honor.

34:21.568 --> 34:25.603
- Dad's Mom's honor.
- Okay, first of all, Dad's mom is Grandma,

34:25.605 --> 34:27.773
and second,
yes, I absolutely do care,

34:27.775 --> 34:29.340
but there has
to be a better way.

34:29.342 --> 34:31.576
This is it, man. Pick a side.

34:31.578 --> 34:33.444
I'm on your side,
but this kind of childish shit

34:33.446 --> 34:34.813
is the exact reason
that Mom doesn't tell us

34:34.815 --> 34:36.347
any of this stuff
in the first place.

34:36.349 --> 34:37.850
Thank you, Dad, for the lecture.

34:37.851 --> 34:39.417
Hey, let me know if
you see my brother around,

34:39.418 --> 34:40.320
I need his help with something.

34:41.187 --> 34:42.186
- I'm right here, Tim.
- Not you, Kevin.

34:42.188 --> 34:43.822
I'm talking about
Captain Dingle over here.

34:43.824 --> 34:45.422
You know what, dude? Fine.

34:45.425 --> 34:47.659
You just kill a guy and
see where that gets you, okay?

34:47.661 --> 34:48.559
Have fun.

34:48.561 --> 34:51.897
I'm not crazy, okay, dude.
I get it.

34:51.899 --> 34:54.331
You know,
maybe one day in the future

34:54.333 --> 34:56.902
Mom's going to find
some guy or something, okay?

34:56.904 --> 34:58.603
I'm not totally opposed to that,

34:58.605 --> 35:02.273
but if he can't prove
himself a worthy successor,

35:02.275 --> 35:03.909
by a few tests of manhood,

35:03.911 --> 35:06.912
then, you know,
maybe he's not the right guy.

35:06.914 --> 35:09.948
Death is not a test of manhood,
dude. He's not Jesus.

35:09.950 --> 35:11.251
He can't rise from the dead.

35:11.786 --> 35:12.617
Gandalf did it.

35:12.619 --> 35:15.188
Gandalf did it,
thank you, Kevin.

35:16.489 --> 35:18.458
Make a choice, Adam.
Are you in or out?

35:21.729 --> 35:22.863
Choose!

35:25.665 --> 35:26.865
Is that a bear?

35:32.572 --> 35:33.741
Bear pit.

35:34.674 --> 35:35.675
Legend.

35:37.343 --> 35:38.378
I'm going to bed.

35:39.279 --> 35:40.779
And when I wake up,

35:40.781 --> 35:45.585
this little idea of
yours better be gone.

35:46.553 --> 35:47.953
All right, Adam.

35:47.955 --> 35:50.655
You're the leader, map's out.

35:50.657 --> 35:52.860
Yeah, I'll
believe it when I see it, bud.

35:53.593 --> 35:56.694
A snake this large would have to
be flown in from South America.

35:56.696 --> 35:59.299
- Now, I have a guy but...
- Give me that!

36:17.852 --> 36:19.584
What's that smell?

36:19.586 --> 36:21.987
Oh, I see we have a
late riser on our hands.

36:21.989 --> 36:24.624
Good almost
afternoon to you, Adam.

36:29.063 --> 36:30.929
What's... what's going on here?

36:30.931 --> 36:33.966
Alan made us breakfast,
cruelty-free veggie omelets.

36:33.968 --> 36:35.870
- They've got kale and everything.
- Oh.

36:37.670 --> 36:39.470
It's like a dream come true.

36:39.472 --> 36:41.307
- You're going to love it.
- These are delicious, Alan.

36:42.709 --> 36:44.509
Now, Adam, what'll it be?

36:44.511 --> 36:46.677
Would you like a two
cage-free free range egger

36:46.679 --> 36:48.513
or a three
cage-free free range egger?

36:48.515 --> 36:49.582
Uh, whatever.

36:50.517 --> 36:51.482
What egg-er?

36:56.422 --> 36:57.622
I just... I don't know.

36:57.624 --> 36:59.357
We were just telling Alan

36:59.359 --> 37:01.059
how we're throwing out
our plans for the weekend,

37:01.061 --> 37:02.426
so we can just
get to know each other.

37:02.428 --> 37:03.661
Oh, great.

37:03.663 --> 37:05.798
That's great, thank you, Tim.
Thank you.

37:05.800 --> 37:08.599
You know, I don't want to interrupt,
but I just was wondering,

37:08.601 --> 37:10.135
what do you guys
usually do when you're here?

37:10.137 --> 37:13.638
I mean, do you just hang out? Do
you just kind of shoot the crap, or what?

37:13.640 --> 37:15.874
Just, you know,
typical guy stuff.

37:15.876 --> 37:18.776
We, uh, we light stuff on fire.

37:18.778 --> 37:22.080
We drink alcoholic beers.

37:22.082 --> 37:24.082
You know, fish, whatever.

37:24.084 --> 37:26.484
Ooh, yikes, I'll definitely
have to sit that one out,

37:26.486 --> 37:28.686
because I can't
imagine anything crueler

37:28.688 --> 37:30.454
than having
a hook in your mouth.

37:30.456 --> 37:32.659
I mean, just, ugh, ow.

37:33.127 --> 37:36.394
I, um, I respect your compassion

37:36.396 --> 37:37.896
for all creatures
on this earth, you know I do.

37:37.898 --> 37:40.098
But, um, and you
got to hear me on this.

37:40.100 --> 37:42.600
Fish are not living things.

37:42.602 --> 37:45.371
They are the vegetables of
the sea. No worries, Alan.

37:45.840 --> 37:46.905
Fishing's out.

37:46.907 --> 37:48.739
Our plans are out the window.

37:48.741 --> 37:50.843
- We want to hear about your plans.
- Really?

37:50.845 --> 37:52.845
Your mother and I were
going to do some birdwatching,

37:52.847 --> 37:54.712
so we could definitely do
that, and they're in season,

37:54.714 --> 37:58.718
and then also, oh, this tops it.
We not even bird.

37:59.586 --> 38:01.153
I have all my
scrapbooking stuff up here.

38:01.155 --> 38:02.653
- Scrapbooking?
- Mm-hmm.

38:02.655 --> 38:03.956
Adam loves scrapbooking.

38:03.958 --> 38:06.024
No way! Are you a scrapper?

38:06.026 --> 38:09.027
- Uh-huh.
- I totally felt that, we're twinsies.

38:09.029 --> 38:12.030
Well, tell you what? Why don't
you take the reins for today, huh?

38:12.032 --> 38:15.433
- What do you say, Adam?
- Best plan I've heard in the past 24 hours, Tim.

38:15.435 --> 38:16.767
Oh, that's wonderful!

38:16.769 --> 38:18.170
This is it, I'm going
to step up to the challenge.

38:18.172 --> 38:19.537
Okay, does anybody want seconds

38:19.539 --> 38:20.573
because we
definitely have seconds?

38:21.641 --> 38:23.141
Is that a bird out there?

38:23.143 --> 38:25.812
- I don't eat breakfast after 10:00.
- Oh, okay. Kev?

38:26.713 --> 38:27.845
Pick one of those.

38:43.463 --> 38:45.463
Ooh!

38:45.465 --> 38:47.099
- Wow!
- You like it?

38:55.842 --> 38:56.709
There you go.

39:05.551 --> 39:06.717
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

39:15.162 --> 39:18.562
This is from my
seventh grade dream diary,

39:18.564 --> 39:22.136
and it's, uh,
"One day I'll have friends."

39:25.072 --> 39:29.241
All right, guys,
score is Team Awesome, three.

39:29.243 --> 39:31.678
Team Friends Forever, zero.

39:32.812 --> 39:34.014
All right, Kev, you're up.

39:35.548 --> 39:36.216
Ha ha!

39:37.684 --> 39:40.087
And go!

39:41.587 --> 39:42.887
- <i>Jaws.</i>
- Yes!

39:42.889 --> 39:44.755
- Yes, yes!
- Oh!

39:44.757 --> 39:46.924
- Yeah!
- Yes, come on!

39:46.926 --> 39:48.559
Bullshit!

39:48.561 --> 39:50.528
- There's no way, there's...
- What, what?

39:50.530 --> 39:53.131
Yeah, you guys got some
catching up to do, come on.

39:53.133 --> 39:55.800
All right, I am
totally feeling this.

39:55.802 --> 39:57.269
Are you ready, buddy?
Here we go.

39:57.271 --> 40:00.305
Come on, we're syncing up, we're
all connected. Are you ready?

40:00.307 --> 40:02.977
- Yep.
- Okay, here we go.

40:03.743 --> 40:04.875
Bompity bo!

40:04.877 --> 40:07.312
Oh, I know this one.
Here we go, ready?

40:07.314 --> 40:09.214
And... go.

40:09.216 --> 40:11.684
Pig, pig, pigtail.

40:12.252 --> 40:14.987
Pigtail, pig penis,
pig penis, pig...

40:14.989 --> 40:16.221
- long penis.
- Come on, am I not getting through here?

40:16.223 --> 40:17.655
Hey, you cannot
talk in this part.

40:17.657 --> 40:19.124
- Okay, okay.
- Zipper.

40:19.126 --> 40:22.960
Pig hands,
pig hands, pat-a-cake.

40:22.962 --> 40:26.064
- And time.
- Oh, oh, oh, it's so close!

40:26.066 --> 40:29.700
- Oh, it was Hambone. That was one of mine.
- Hambone?

40:29.702 --> 40:31.802
The category was movies, Alan.

40:31.804 --> 40:34.705
Yeah, I know I figured
that out about halfway through.

40:34.707 --> 40:36.974
Okay, uh, I need to take a walk.

40:36.976 --> 40:39.177
Uh, uh, uh, not so fast, mister.

40:39.179 --> 40:40.878
There are bears out there.

40:40.880 --> 40:42.682
- You need some bear spray first.
- Fine.

40:44.650 --> 40:46.650
- What are you... what are you doing?
- Well, it's...

40:46.652 --> 40:48.253
It's just basically
like bug spray for bears.

40:48.255 --> 40:50.721
- No, no, no!
- Oh, no, oh, no!

40:50.723 --> 40:52.324
Oh, you got to hold still.

40:52.326 --> 40:54.825
Oh, whew!

40:54.827 --> 40:55.993
Oh, that's heavy.

40:57.730 --> 40:58.896
- Tim!
- Yeah?

40:58.898 --> 41:00.898
- I swallowed it.
- Kevin!

41:00.900 --> 41:02.700
You guys stay here,
I'm going to get help.

41:06.739 --> 41:08.240
I am so sorry.

41:08.242 --> 41:09.374
They told me that it
would keep the bears away,

41:09.376 --> 41:11.243
but they didn't
tell me how to use it.

41:11.245 --> 41:12.945
I'm definitely
writing them a letter.

41:13.746 --> 41:14.947
You can take that to the bank.

41:15.615 --> 41:17.215
Oh, is there
anything that I can do?

41:17.217 --> 41:19.919
You know, they tell me that I do
some pretty good head scratches.

41:20.853 --> 41:23.788
Here we go. Break an egg
on your head...

41:23.790 --> 41:25.723
...and the yolk runs down.

41:25.725 --> 41:26.959
Just get me a beer, bud.

41:28.162 --> 41:30.197
Don't you think it's a little
early in the day for alcohol?

41:30.963 --> 41:33.198
- What's that?
- For alcohol, I think it's a little early.

41:33.200 --> 41:36.033
I mean, I'm generally
like a after five o'clock boy,

41:36.035 --> 41:37.570
but you know what?

41:38.205 --> 41:40.971
We're all men here,
doing guy stuff, right?

41:40.973 --> 41:42.740
I have just the thing.

41:42.742 --> 41:45.976
Oh, oh, you guys,
wait for the party to explode.

41:45.978 --> 41:48.148
Hang on, you're going to feel
a whole lot better in a second.

41:49.249 --> 41:52.850
I was saving this for your mom and I...

41:52.852 --> 41:55.688
...but when the cat's away,
the mice will play.

41:58.024 --> 41:59.357
Here you go.

41:59.359 --> 42:02.059
Now, some ground rules.

42:02.061 --> 42:05.363
As long as everybody
does this within reason,

42:05.365 --> 42:07.665
and there's no bad
decisions that are made.

42:07.667 --> 42:09.733
- Of course.
- We take actions that honor our bodies,

42:09.735 --> 42:16.108
I think that we can have
ourselves a good old time in style.

42:16.110 --> 42:18.112
Anybody up for a
little brown sackin' it?

42:18.811 --> 42:20.713
- Brown sackin' it?
- Yeah.

42:21.415 --> 42:23.714
See, this is what happens.
We just kind of loosen up.

42:23.716 --> 42:25.352
We break down some walls.

42:26.186 --> 42:28.919
Who wants to be
the first to sip the sack?

42:28.921 --> 42:30.222
Come on, don't be shy.

42:30.224 --> 42:33.991
Who's ready to put
their lips to the old brownie?

42:33.993 --> 42:36.927
You know what? Brown me up.

42:36.929 --> 42:38.296
My man!

42:38.298 --> 42:39.333
Right, guys?

42:40.200 --> 42:41.266
Go to brown town.

42:41.268 --> 42:45.903
Now, Kevin, I think
it's only fair that as eldest,

42:45.905 --> 42:48.406
the brownie would
be Adam's birthright.

42:48.408 --> 42:49.343
Adam?

42:50.710 --> 42:51.411
Adam?

42:52.945 --> 42:56.714
Do you want to be the first to take a
big swallow from the old man pouch?

42:56.716 --> 42:57.848
Don't be rude, Adam.

42:57.850 --> 43:00.653
Take a drink from Alan's
mouthwatering old man pouch.

43:08.928 --> 43:12.297
Oh, I don't Adam's ready
for the old wrinkled wraparound.

43:12.299 --> 43:14.798
What the hell is this, man?
Bloody Mary mix?

43:14.800 --> 43:17.271
Well, I say we toast.

43:18.172 --> 43:20.773
To man pouches...

43:22.476 --> 43:23.910
fun times...

43:25.212 --> 43:29.013
- no plans.
- I, sir, will drink to that,

43:29.015 --> 43:31.115
and I have another one.

43:31.117 --> 43:33.353
This is one is to
the ladies in our lives.

43:34.421 --> 43:35.487
To a wonderful mother,
of course.

43:35.489 --> 43:39.023
She's a wonderful woman,
wonderful roommate too.

43:39.025 --> 43:42.360
And to Tim's future wife,
Christy Borders.

43:42.362 --> 43:46.431
Christy Borders is a swamp woman with
a glass eye and a shovel face, no thanks.

43:48.268 --> 43:51.168
And I think Adam has
a beautiful bride at home,

43:51.170 --> 43:53.505
if I'm not mistaken.
I've seen some pictures of her.

43:53.507 --> 43:56.508
Ooh, here's to you, good sir.
Hat's off to you.

43:56.510 --> 43:57.808
You know what's funny though?

43:57.810 --> 44:00.844
She looks
just like the young lady

44:00.846 --> 44:03.180
that is our spin instructor
over at Shapers,

44:03.182 --> 44:04.449
and I'll tell you something,

44:04.451 --> 44:06.351
that woman is a
little firecracker.

44:06.353 --> 44:08.118
Oh, if I were a younger man.

44:08.120 --> 44:11.055
I put the boots to her!

44:11.057 --> 44:14.259
Knocking the boots,
making the bacon.

44:14.261 --> 44:15.928
Isn't Shapers just for women?

44:16.396 --> 44:17.861
Pretty sweet of Alan to notice

44:17.863 --> 44:19.997
how attractive
your wife is, isn't he?

44:19.999 --> 44:24.302
Oh, come on. Any red-blooded man
is going to notice a woman like that.

44:24.304 --> 44:27.439
You're just upset that
he locked her down first.

44:27.441 --> 44:28.573
Here's to Katie, come on.

44:28.575 --> 44:31.509
- Katie, to Katie.
- To Katie.

44:31.511 --> 44:33.110
Katie, Katie, Katie!

44:33.112 --> 44:35.781
Yeah!

44:36.983 --> 44:39.484
- Oh.
- Whoops, uh-oh.

44:39.486 --> 44:42.186
- Clumsy. Just...
- Oh, I'll get it.

44:42.188 --> 44:44.389
Uh, Tim, did you, um,

44:44.391 --> 44:49.193
did you have like a... like a plan or
something that you wanted to do today?

44:49.195 --> 44:50.928
I may have mapped something out.

44:50.930 --> 44:52.896
Is that the map
with all the dead Alans?

44:52.898 --> 44:54.834
Kev, you joker!

44:55.302 --> 44:57.868
Uh, Alan, I
think we are going to need

44:57.870 --> 45:00.137
- some firewood for tonight.
- Okay.

45:00.139 --> 45:02.975
I've got a map that will take us
to the best spot, what do you say?

45:03.976 --> 45:05.175
Yeah, sure, that sounds great.

45:05.177 --> 45:07.447
Just a little bit higher, bud!

45:08.315 --> 45:10.948
The good one's at the top,
you're doing great!

45:10.950 --> 45:12.952
Yeah? Okay.

45:14.086 --> 45:17.455
Hey, uh, what about,
uh, what about this one?

45:17.457 --> 45:19.524
No, no, that won't burn.

45:19.526 --> 45:21.359
Up top, let's not
make a thing out of this.

45:21.361 --> 45:23.861
But this one's got,
like, kindling on it.

45:23.863 --> 45:25.131
Got to have that top wood, bud!

45:26.832 --> 45:30.100
About time you came around, man. We were like
ten minutes away from a show tunes review.

45:30.102 --> 45:32.838
Yeah, man, you're right.
This guy's got to go.

45:33.640 --> 45:37.609
And you know,
if this map is the way to do it,

45:37.611 --> 45:38.942
then I guess it's worth a shot.

45:38.944 --> 45:40.645
Sounds good to me. Kev, you in?

45:42.582 --> 45:45.017
I've dedicated my life
to pacifism, so.

45:46.486 --> 45:47.352
Great, Kev's in.

45:47.354 --> 45:50.022
I, I do draw the
line at murder though.

45:50.923 --> 45:53.023
Whoa, ah!

45:56.162 --> 45:57.163
Sweet.

46:03.202 --> 46:04.436
How many fingers
am I holding up?

46:04.438 --> 46:06.972
Three? Good job.
You're going to be fine.

46:08.240 --> 46:09.576
Am I still falling?

46:12.679 --> 46:16.282
A dark evil has awakened.
You need to flee this place.

46:17.283 --> 46:21.051
Oh, nonsense,
it's just a scratch.

46:21.053 --> 46:23.421
Hey, Kev? Do me a favor,

46:23.423 --> 46:26.190
there's a lot of good wood
that came down with me.

46:26.192 --> 46:27.525
It's all over
there in the woods.

46:27.527 --> 46:29.293
Just, just pick it up,
would you?

46:32.264 --> 46:35.467
So, uh, Al,
you ever start a fire before?

46:35.469 --> 46:37.968
No. Confidentiality, Tim,
your mother and I...

46:37.970 --> 46:39.704
- That's great, man. Hey, Kev.
- Yeah?

46:39.706 --> 46:43.006
Why don't you come over here and
show Alan how to start a Man Camp fire.

46:43.008 --> 46:44.341
Oh, sure.

46:44.343 --> 46:47.344
You take, uh,
this is called a flint.

46:47.346 --> 46:51.949
And you take, uh, the back
of a knife and just get going.

46:51.951 --> 46:53.418
Oh, that's good,
you're getting some sparks.

46:53.420 --> 46:54.419
Really getting
some sparks there.

46:54.421 --> 46:56.353
Oh, let me, I think I can do
that. Thank you.

46:56.355 --> 46:58.088
- Yes!
- There you go, bud.

46:58.090 --> 46:59.591
Now you got a spark going there.

46:59.593 --> 47:01.158
- Oh!
- All right, Al.

47:01.160 --> 47:03.060
You got it,
you're like a firecracker.

47:03.062 --> 47:05.898
- Al, come on over, man. Try it on the pile.
- Me?

47:06.400 --> 47:08.999
- Yeah, you're good.
- Let me get in close.

47:09.001 --> 47:09.669
Oh!

47:10.737 --> 47:13.507
Ah!

47:16.510 --> 47:18.041
I think I saw Satan.

47:20.580 --> 47:23.013
- Oh!
- Yes!

47:23.015 --> 47:24.283
Oh!

47:27.019 --> 47:28.986
- Oh.
- A little much for you there, Al?

47:28.988 --> 47:31.088
Ew, no, there beer is not right.

47:31.090 --> 47:32.492
There's something wrong there.

47:34.193 --> 47:36.293
- Asparagus.
- Timbo?

47:36.295 --> 47:38.998
Timbo, it's your shot,
I'm killing it out here, man.

47:39.999 --> 47:42.001
- Tim?
- Tim!

47:43.335 --> 47:44.301
Ugh.

47:44.303 --> 47:45.337
Tim?

47:46.540 --> 47:49.474
Your pound, Tim. It's our shot,
bud. Bud?

47:51.578 --> 47:52.512
Tim?

47:58.284 --> 47:59.218
Tim?

48:02.556 --> 48:05.590
Shh, shh, shh. It's me, it's me.

48:08.294 --> 48:11.195
- Are you in blackface?
- What?

48:11.197 --> 48:13.430
No, it's Navy Seal camo paint,
don't be such a noob.

48:13.432 --> 48:16.400
- What are you doing?
- Going commando for this next phase.

48:16.402 --> 48:18.235
What does that
have to do with anything?

48:18.237 --> 48:19.704
Just get Alan out about 15 yards

48:19.706 --> 48:21.106
into the woods
towards the creek.

48:22.041 --> 48:22.973
- Okay.
- Okay.

48:22.975 --> 48:27.077
Hey, um, did you
pee in one of the cups?

48:27.079 --> 48:28.780
I peed in all the cups.

48:28.782 --> 48:31.016
It's my signature move.
Everybody loses.

48:34.721 --> 48:36.253
- You rolled a four.
- No!

48:37.491 --> 48:40.390
I mean, talk
about a critical fail.

48:40.392 --> 48:42.794
So he garrisoned
on an enchantment.

48:42.796 --> 48:45.329
Exactly! Exactly!

48:45.331 --> 48:48.265
- That's unbelievable!
- Unbelievable!

48:48.267 --> 48:49.834
You, don't even worry about it,

48:49.836 --> 48:51.803
because we're just
rapping some D&D here.

48:51.805 --> 48:53.538
- He don't know.
- You don't know.

48:53.540 --> 48:57.274
You guys having,
like, a fellowship together?

48:58.778 --> 49:02.514
- Yes, and no, it's more of a guild than a fellowship.
- Yeah!

49:02.516 --> 49:06.116
Alan, actually uh, I need
you to go down um, to the creek

49:06.118 --> 49:10.254
to um, get something from
the creek.

49:10.256 --> 49:12.322
What, is it a secret?

49:12.324 --> 49:13.758
Uh, water... water.

49:13.760 --> 49:15.227
For breakfast tomorrow.

49:18.364 --> 49:21.265
- But can't we just use the sink?
- It's not potable.

49:21.267 --> 49:24.301
Listen, Alan, we all got
to pull our weight around here.

49:24.303 --> 49:26.638
Can you just head
down there and get that?

49:26.640 --> 49:30.577
I will be back before
you can say prestidigitation.

49:32.244 --> 49:33.778
Whoops!

49:33.780 --> 49:37.082
The, the creek,
it's swarming with Giardia.

49:37.884 --> 49:39.351
Yeah, probably.

49:45.892 --> 49:51.631
Low, medium, high, full.

49:57.771 --> 49:59.271
There you are, buddy.

49:59.773 --> 50:02.508
- What are we doing?
- Shh! Watching.

50:04.578 --> 50:07.712
Go get some water,
I can do that easy enough,

50:07.714 --> 50:09.814
as soon as I find the creek.

50:11.183 --> 50:15.855
- "Professional Strength Electrified Animal Fence."
- There you go.

50:18.357 --> 50:20.792
There you go, keep walking.

50:20.794 --> 50:23.728
So, I guess everybody's
got to do their share.

50:23.730 --> 50:25.362
Everybody's got
to carry their weight.

50:25.364 --> 50:26.565
What did he mean by that?

50:27.299 --> 50:29.701
It sounded like
kind of a fat crack to me.

50:29.703 --> 50:31.671
Right into my little...

50:33.673 --> 50:35.441
What's he doing?

50:39.478 --> 50:41.244
Dammit, he's taking a piss.

50:41.246 --> 50:42.780
Hey, are you sure this is safe?

50:46.653 --> 50:47.821
Alan!

50:55.795 --> 50:57.227
Oh, shit!

50:57.229 --> 50:58.497
Dude, dude!

50:59.465 --> 51:00.330
Sick.

51:00.332 --> 51:02.432
- What happened?
- I don't know, Kevin.

51:02.434 --> 51:03.635
- Alan?
- What?

51:03.637 --> 51:05.302
- Alan, are you okay?
- Oh, my God.

51:05.304 --> 51:07.839
- Is he okay?
- I don't know, Kevin!

51:07.841 --> 51:09.841
Mom, is it time for school?

51:09.843 --> 51:11.341
Let's get him to the couch.

51:11.343 --> 51:13.477
Alan, hey, you okay, bud?

51:13.479 --> 51:14.979
- What, what?
- Are you going to be all right?

51:14.981 --> 51:16.513
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

51:16.515 --> 51:18.850
Oh, no, I mean,
no, I'm fine.

51:18.852 --> 51:21.653
Hey, guys, what'd I miss?
Woof, what happened to you?

51:21.655 --> 51:22.689
Oh, I don't know.

51:23.657 --> 51:25.255
I just relieving myself,

51:25.257 --> 51:28.558
and then I heard Kevin
calling me over, and then

51:28.560 --> 51:30.527
from out of nowhere
this surge of,

51:30.529 --> 51:33.931
this surge of energy
entered from my, my penis.

51:33.933 --> 51:36.299
And then it just
electrified my entire body.

51:36.301 --> 51:39.636
We didn't ask what happened the
first time you saw a dolphin jump.

51:39.638 --> 51:40.740
What happened outside?

51:41.908 --> 51:43.943
- Are you going to be all right, Alan?
- I don't know.

51:44.678 --> 51:48.012
I mean, I think so, I just,
I don't know what happened.

51:48.014 --> 51:49.747
Heat lightning probably.

51:49.749 --> 51:52.582
You must have some extremely
high iron levels in your piss.

51:52.584 --> 51:53.718
Must've attracted a bolt.

51:53.720 --> 51:56.553
That's weird,
because in my research,

51:56.555 --> 51:58.655
urine was
always a poor conductor.

51:58.657 --> 52:02.392
You know what, Alan? Let's, uh,
let's get you to bed, come on.

52:02.394 --> 52:04.996
Okay, do I have
to go in the tent?

52:04.998 --> 52:07.965
Uh, yeah, yeah.

52:07.967 --> 52:11.301
Oh, okay, well,
that's only fair.

52:11.303 --> 52:13.205
Hey, could one of
you guys zip me up?

52:16.341 --> 52:18.442
A-1 in the books,
nice work, boys.

52:18.444 --> 52:21.380
That was all on
your map, was it?

52:23.750 --> 52:24.882
I don't want any part of this.

52:24.884 --> 52:28.052
You're just,
you're just bullying him!

52:28.054 --> 52:29.856
Like you bully everybody else!

52:30.724 --> 52:32.957
Cool, so you're just
going to let him marry Mom

52:32.959 --> 52:34.859
and have their
little happily ever after?

52:34.861 --> 52:36.359
I don't think it'd be
the worst thing in the world.

52:36.361 --> 52:37.496
Cool!

52:43.002 --> 52:44.904
So, you find a new place to live yet?

52:46.973 --> 52:51.008
Well, once they're
married and he's all moved in,

52:51.010 --> 52:52.678
they're not just going
to want you hanging around.

52:53.545 --> 52:55.614
You don't know that. Adam?

53:00.019 --> 53:01.720
He's got a point, Kev.

53:02.789 --> 53:06.423
No, Alan and I,
we're in a guild, okay?

53:06.425 --> 53:08.525
So, he'd never betray me.

53:08.527 --> 53:10.393
Things change, Kevin.

53:10.395 --> 53:11.330
Guilds break up.

53:12.364 --> 53:13.798
Once he moves in,

53:13.800 --> 53:17.434
your little Friday
fro-yo dates with Mom, bye bye.

53:17.436 --> 53:19.871
Mac and cheese
ready every day at 12:30?

53:19.873 --> 53:21.404
Nope.

53:21.406 --> 53:23.841
Your movie spot on the couch,
your favorite spot.

53:23.843 --> 53:25.243
- No!
- Effing ta-ta, man.

53:25.245 --> 53:29.013
I... I mean, you probably stand
to lose more in this than any of us,

53:29.015 --> 53:32.349
and we're not
saying you can't be friends,

53:32.351 --> 53:34.986
but we need to put
a stop to this wedding.

53:34.988 --> 53:35.789
Think about it.

53:38.057 --> 53:39.658
I need to be
alone with my thoughts.

53:48.835 --> 53:51.803
- I think we got him.
- That shit you pulled tonight was too far.

53:51.805 --> 53:53.603
I explicitly said no murder.

53:53.605 --> 53:55.574
You pull that
shit again and I'm done.

53:57.776 --> 53:59.711
Last I checked,
the guy's not dead.

54:06.385 --> 54:07.719
Pfft, vomit.

54:21.466 --> 54:22.434
Hey, Timmy.

54:22.969 --> 54:23.837
Christy?

54:25.171 --> 54:27.939
What are you doing here?
Go away, you're gross.

54:27.941 --> 54:29.108
Oh, really?

54:29.943 --> 54:31.376
Is this gross?

54:32.846 --> 54:34.411
Yes.

54:34.413 --> 54:35.614
What about this?

54:37.016 --> 54:39.016
- Uh...
- Mm-hmm?

54:43.189 --> 54:44.922
I got something else for you.

54:44.924 --> 54:46.092
Oh.

54:47.093 --> 54:49.126
These, bills to pay!

54:49.128 --> 54:51.128
- What?
- Tiffany has horseback riding lessons

54:51.130 --> 54:52.529
and you're
behind on the payments.

54:52.531 --> 54:54.564
- No!
- I've got bible study.

54:54.566 --> 54:55.867
- What?
- That's $60 a day.

54:55.869 --> 54:58.702
For what? That should be free!

54:58.704 --> 55:00.104
Did you pick up the
kids from soccer practice?

55:00.106 --> 55:01.738
We don't have kids.

55:01.740 --> 55:05.442
- Timmy, Penelope, Julep, Jeremiah.
- Oh, my God!

55:05.444 --> 55:07.912
Andy, and Molly,
I'm forgetting someone.

55:09.115 --> 55:10.114
Julep's a Boy Scout now.

55:10.116 --> 55:11.949
- He wants you to be the team leader.
- No!

55:11.951 --> 55:13.617
There's some logs
that need splitting outside.

55:33.505 --> 55:35.174
Did you think at all about what
we talked about last night?

55:36.109 --> 55:37.509
We'll see what happens.

55:39.611 --> 55:40.545
Oh, morning, sunshine.

55:41.114 --> 55:42.681
Glad you could join the men.

55:43.216 --> 55:44.714
Did you get your
hair curled just right?

55:44.716 --> 55:47.517
Eat it, dude. I was FaceTiming
with Katie and Max.

55:47.519 --> 55:51.088
FaceTiming at Man Camp? Dude,
you are so whipped.

55:55.161 --> 55:56.528
What are you doing?

55:57.263 --> 56:00.764
I was just thinking
about Katie whipping me

56:00.766 --> 56:02.801
with, like, a little Indiana
Jones hat on or something.

56:03.802 --> 56:05.937
That body belongs in a museum.

56:06.905 --> 56:07.906
You guys are going to Hell.

56:08.840 --> 56:11.843
Temple of Do Me.

56:16.515 --> 56:18.848
- Alan still asleep?
- Yeah.

56:18.850 --> 56:19.986
We should probably wake him up.

56:33.932 --> 56:37.168
Bear!

56:41.840 --> 56:43.274
Bear, Bear!

57:10.869 --> 57:13.505
Kevin!

58:07.360 --> 58:10.061
Oh, that was so close!

58:10.063 --> 58:11.297
I almost had it!

58:13.965 --> 58:16.133
How long has he been out there?

58:16.135 --> 58:18.001
Like, 45 minutes.

58:18.003 --> 58:20.870
I don't get it, he should
have severe hypothermia by now,

58:20.872 --> 58:21.907
like near death.

58:24.843 --> 58:26.976
Man, he's really
going for it out there.

58:26.978 --> 58:29.045
I got to hand it to him, I mean,

58:29.047 --> 58:31.748
he might be a dumb ass
but he's a committed one.

58:31.750 --> 58:33.650
Yeah, well, you know,

58:33.652 --> 58:35.352
at least somebody's
not afraid of commitment.

58:35.354 --> 58:37.290
Is that supposed to make
me upset? Because it doesn't.

58:37.956 --> 58:39.390
Getting married,
having kids, that's great.

58:39.392 --> 58:40.424
But...

58:40.426 --> 58:42.659
...you're not always
going to be there for him,

58:42.661 --> 58:44.230
and I'm not going to
put another kid through that.

58:45.063 --> 58:46.397
Look at Kev.

58:46.399 --> 58:47.231
So weird, dude.

58:47.233 --> 58:49.400
This guy's going
to be our stepdad?

58:49.402 --> 58:51.000
Dad would be so pissed.

58:51.002 --> 58:52.136
Dad wouldn't be
pissed, guys.

58:52.138 --> 58:56.739
What was that, um, that
saying that he came up with?

58:56.741 --> 58:58.908
"Never judge a book by
its cover."

58:58.910 --> 59:02.246
- Kevin, Dad didn't make that up, that's like...
- Literally everyone says that.

59:02.248 --> 59:03.746
- Every dad.
- Everyone says that.

59:03.748 --> 59:06.683
Oh, got it! I got one!

59:06.685 --> 59:07.750
- Oh, shit!
- I got it!

59:07.752 --> 59:10.387
- Oh!
- Oh, my God, it's screaming!

59:10.389 --> 59:12.689
It's screaming! Fish scream?

59:12.691 --> 59:14.958
Oh, my God!
Someone, please, help!

59:14.960 --> 59:17.394
- Help!
- Not living things, Alan, remember!

59:17.396 --> 59:18.928
Veggies of the sea.

59:18.930 --> 59:21.232
- Ugh!
- You got to put it out of its misery, bud.

59:21.234 --> 59:22.333
Most people like...

59:24.470 --> 59:26.137
- Oh!
- what?

59:26.139 --> 59:27.404
Wow!

59:29.774 --> 59:31.342
I hope you're happy!

59:31.344 --> 59:34.077
Well done,
you sick son of a bitch.

59:35.747 --> 59:37.248
So, let me get this straight.

59:37.250 --> 59:39.483
I said put it out of its misery,

59:39.485 --> 59:41.352
and you first
thought is let me bite

59:41.354 --> 59:43.753
this creature's
head off like a monster?

59:43.755 --> 59:46.357
Well, it seemed
the closest type of death

59:46.359 --> 59:48.126
that it might've
faced in the natural world.

59:49.395 --> 59:50.396
I respect that actually.

59:53.232 --> 59:55.432
You know that
was a setup, right?

59:55.434 --> 59:58.169
Like a joke we play on
people that are stupid enough

59:58.171 --> 01:00:00.404
to think you can
actually catch a fish like that.

01:00:00.406 --> 01:00:02.339
Yeah, that part
was pretty obvious.

01:00:02.341 --> 01:00:04.275
Well, then why didn't
you just stand up for yourself?

01:00:04.277 --> 01:00:06.212
What, so you could electrocute
me on something else?

01:00:07.946 --> 01:00:12.115
I went in that water with
that ridiculous little spear

01:00:12.117 --> 01:00:13.450
to make a statement to you boys

01:00:13.452 --> 01:00:15.319
that there's nothing
I wouldn't do

01:00:15.321 --> 01:00:18.154
to try to make it work with this family,
on your terms, not mine.

01:00:18.156 --> 01:00:20.224
I'd have
stayed out there all night,

01:00:20.226 --> 01:00:24.060
until either you broke
or I stabbed a damn fish.

01:00:24.062 --> 01:00:28.232
I mean, it was supposed to
be this big cathartic symbol.

01:00:28.234 --> 01:00:30.334
Then I actually pierced
one's skin,

01:00:30.336 --> 01:00:32.904
and it shrieked,
and I just panicked.

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:35.838
Well, well done.

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.142
Yeah, thanks.

01:00:38.678 --> 01:00:40.910
But if you think it's going to be that
easy, you got another thing coming.

01:00:40.912 --> 01:00:42.346
You got a lot to live up to

01:00:42.348 --> 01:00:44.383
when it comes to
marriage number one.

01:00:45.551 --> 01:00:47.886
I know he'll
always be her soulmate, Tim.

01:00:49.322 --> 01:00:51.455
And that's the way it should be.

01:00:51.457 --> 01:00:53.823
He must've been a hell of a man.

01:00:53.825 --> 01:00:55.459
I... I wish I had met him.

01:00:58.830 --> 01:01:00.832
I'm just glad
she likes being around me.

01:01:04.936 --> 01:01:06.405
Well, I'm going to
put on some dry clothes.

01:01:19.150 --> 01:01:21.920
Everybody hydrate and tell your
wives and kids you love them.

01:01:22.854 --> 01:01:24.122
We're going to Curly's.

01:01:24.923 --> 01:01:26.923
Come on, you bitch.
This is happening, okay?

01:01:26.925 --> 01:01:28.024
Don't make me take you by force.

01:01:28.026 --> 01:01:30.394
I promised Katie that I
would never go back there,

01:01:30.396 --> 01:01:31.428
not after last time.

01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:32.663
Come on, dude.

01:01:32.665 --> 01:01:35.566
The charges were dropped,
and the guy didn't die, I mean...

01:01:35.568 --> 01:01:38.935
Didn't die? That's your
qualification for everything being fine,

01:01:38.937 --> 01:01:41.170
- that he didn't die.
- How else are we supposed to bond

01:01:41.172 --> 01:01:44.475
with wiener lips back here
if we don't take him to Curly's?

01:01:44.477 --> 01:01:46.379
It's what separates
the men from the boys.

01:01:48.146 --> 01:01:50.046
Adam, bro.

01:01:56.087 --> 01:01:57.088
Fine.

01:01:58.457 --> 01:02:02.393
But... phones are
locked in the glove box.

01:02:02.395 --> 01:02:06.229
No evidence,
and two drink max, okay?

01:02:06.231 --> 01:02:07.198
Totes, dude.

01:02:07.932 --> 01:02:11.968
Two more moonshines, please!

01:02:11.970 --> 01:02:14.170
Three, Kevin?
Kevin, you having a moonshine?

01:02:14.172 --> 01:02:16.039
I switched to water an hour ago.

01:02:16.041 --> 01:02:17.441
Kevin switched
to water an hour ago.

01:02:17.443 --> 01:02:19.576
Could you lift your chin
just a little...

01:02:19.578 --> 01:02:20.479
Perfect.

01:02:21.246 --> 01:02:23.279
Thank you. Where's Alan?

01:02:23.281 --> 01:02:24.548
Where's that guy?

01:02:29.287 --> 01:02:32.556
Now, dude, if you hurt
my mom, she's a good dude.

01:02:32.558 --> 01:02:33.892
If you hurt her...

01:02:36.895 --> 01:02:38.294
- Wow.
- Get it?

01:02:38.296 --> 01:02:41.164
Okay, number one,
I get what you're saying,

01:02:41.166 --> 01:02:45.101
but hold your horses,
because I love her, okay?

01:02:45.103 --> 01:02:46.503
- Me too, me too.
- So if you love someone...

01:02:46.505 --> 01:02:48.339
I know you do,
and I believe in that,

01:02:48.341 --> 01:02:51.542
but if I love someone,
I'm not going to hurt someone,

01:02:51.544 --> 01:02:54.411
because she's my family, bro.
Just like you are.

01:02:54.413 --> 01:02:55.512
- You are family.
- That's right.

01:02:55.514 --> 01:02:57.947
- Never above you, never below you.
- That's right.

01:02:57.949 --> 01:02:59.452
- Always with you.
- That's it.

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:03.387
- I hear, you know...
- Ugh!

01:03:03.389 --> 01:03:06.392
If somebody... to Katie...
if somebody did something...

01:03:07.992 --> 01:03:10.561
One time,
this guy wrote something

01:03:10.563 --> 01:03:14.531
- about her on a bathroom wall, dude.
- No way!

01:03:14.533 --> 01:03:17.033
- And I was...
- Are you serious?

01:03:17.035 --> 01:03:20.373
Oh, you, you killed him?

01:03:21.407 --> 01:03:23.239
- I wanted to.
- Oh.

01:03:23.241 --> 01:03:26.610
I almost did. I still almost
want to kill him, almost.

01:03:26.612 --> 01:03:28.211
- Almost.
- I'm going to do it.

01:03:28.213 --> 01:03:30.079
I'm going to rough him up!

01:03:30.081 --> 01:03:32.383
- I'm going to rough up Eric Brinkerhoff.
- Yeah!

01:03:32.385 --> 01:03:33.983
- Tim!
- Come on!

01:03:33.985 --> 01:03:38.323
What do they call
a, uh, straight flush?

01:03:40.024 --> 01:03:41.725
I think it's a win, right?

01:03:43.027 --> 01:03:45.396
Nice, eh. Enjoy the watch.

01:03:45.398 --> 01:03:47.698
Thank you, big watch.

01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:49.700
- I need your keys.
- Ain't happening, bud.

01:03:49.702 --> 01:03:51.968
- No, it's just me and Alan just...
- All right, who's next?

01:03:51.970 --> 01:03:54.203
Me and Alan are
going to go rough up Eric,

01:03:54.205 --> 01:03:56.239
Eric Brinkerhoff and I
need the keys...

01:03:56.241 --> 01:03:57.408
Hey, bud, why don't you
sober up for a half hour,

01:03:57.410 --> 01:04:00.446
then I'll go rough up Eric
Brinkerface, okay?

01:04:05.183 --> 01:04:06.419
Your wife is hot.

01:04:07.486 --> 01:04:08.621
What are you looking at?

01:04:09.755 --> 01:04:13.724
This one time, I got to
second base with Katie Baker.

01:04:15.093 --> 01:04:17.428
Katie Baker is
my wife, you asshole!

01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:18.662
We got a problem, son?

01:04:20.165 --> 01:04:21.230
Second base.

01:04:21.232 --> 01:04:22.535
I'm about to rough you up!

01:04:26.572 --> 01:04:27.438
Now if I could just get you to,

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:30.239
just turn to the
light a little bit.

01:04:30.241 --> 01:04:31.407
Cheek down.

01:04:33.077 --> 01:04:35.044
- Like this? Mm-hmm.
- Absolutely.

01:04:36.515 --> 01:04:39.650
Are you sure you never modeled before?

01:04:39.652 --> 01:04:41.050
That was good.

01:04:41.052 --> 01:04:44.053
You have the brow
line of a Nordic queen.

01:04:45.323 --> 01:04:46.958
I'm sure you get
that all the time.

01:04:47.693 --> 01:04:51.260
My daddy said I had the
hardest forehead he'd ever seen.

01:04:51.262 --> 01:04:52.195
Well, he's not wrong.

01:04:52.197 --> 01:04:54.430
It's hard.

01:04:54.432 --> 01:04:58.234
And also pensive, inquisitive.

01:04:58.236 --> 01:05:00.573
No, I ain't no inquisitiver.

01:05:01.674 --> 01:05:04.273
Are you by any chance a Virgo?

01:05:04.275 --> 01:05:07.345
Nope, not since I was 15.

01:05:11.082 --> 01:05:13.416
Daddy like.

01:05:13.418 --> 01:05:16.118
You moron, you brought
this on yourself.

01:05:18.056 --> 01:05:19.623
Got him, go, go, go run!

01:05:19.625 --> 01:05:21.224
I'll be right there! Uh, no.

01:05:21.226 --> 01:05:22.425
No, no, no, don't fight it.

01:05:22.427 --> 01:05:23.494
Don't fight it.

01:05:29.702 --> 01:05:32.268
Holy shit, that was amazing, dude!

01:05:32.270 --> 01:05:34.538
Dude, we threw that guy!
We threw him!

01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:36.339
We threw a guy!

01:05:36.341 --> 01:05:39.275
And Alan, Alan
with the choke hold, bro!

01:05:40.579 --> 01:05:43.279
My man! Alan?

01:05:43.281 --> 01:05:44.182
Alan?

01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:46.550
We forgot Alan!

01:05:50.355 --> 01:05:51.289
Kevin.

01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:57.126
What are they doing?

01:05:57.128 --> 01:05:59.830
They're probably divvying
up his personal effects.

01:05:59.832 --> 01:06:02.733
- Yeah!
- Now, I'm sure you're all wondering,

01:06:02.735 --> 01:06:07.169
what happened to Lumpy's card,
and it's right here!

01:06:09.307 --> 01:06:11.142
Yeah!

01:06:14.112 --> 01:06:16.647
Oh, my ride's here, got to go.

01:06:16.649 --> 01:06:17.515
Like hell you do.

01:06:18.884 --> 01:06:22.586
Curly, I'd like to buy these
sons of bitches a round of drinks.

01:06:22.588 --> 01:06:24.621
Yeah!

01:06:28.727 --> 01:06:31.496
- Home.
- We're home!

01:06:32.363 --> 01:06:34.898
Oh, man, I shouldn't
have hit those cheese fries.

01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:36.733
Where did you
learn how to do that?

01:06:36.735 --> 01:06:38.467
- What, the rear naked choke?
- Yeah.

01:06:38.469 --> 01:06:40.503
Oh, your mom and I,

01:06:40.505 --> 01:06:43.439
see, we take a
self-defense fitness class.

01:06:43.441 --> 01:06:47.443
Every Tuesday at 11:30,
that's actually,

01:06:47.445 --> 01:06:49.780
that's why I go to Shapers,

01:06:49.782 --> 01:06:53.349
and it is for women,
just so you know, Kev, it is.

01:06:53.351 --> 01:06:55.652
But you know what?

01:06:55.654 --> 01:06:58.855
Old Tara, she gets a little
self-conscious now and then

01:06:58.857 --> 01:07:01.357
when she's trying something new,
so I said, you know what?

01:07:01.359 --> 01:07:03.660
- Taking care of Tara.
- Taking care of Tara.

01:07:03.662 --> 01:07:05.461
Well, I don't
want to start crying,

01:07:05.463 --> 01:07:07.598
but you know what I didn't know,

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.801
I didn't know that
I would be using it like that.

01:07:14.172 --> 01:07:15.573
Hiya!

01:07:17.508 --> 01:07:18.574
Did anyone get a video?

01:07:18.576 --> 01:07:22.178
No, because our phones
were all locked in the truck.

01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:25.381
- Thanks a lot, Adam.
- Oh, Adam.

01:07:25.383 --> 01:07:27.251
You're welcome, you guys.

01:07:28.453 --> 01:07:31.187
I'll go get them for you guys.

01:07:31.189 --> 01:07:35.224
Yeah, Alan, you're my new buddy.

01:07:35.226 --> 01:07:40.296
You saved me with chokehold,
because... oh, oh, oh.

01:07:40.298 --> 01:07:42.666
Oh, it's Alan's phone.

01:07:42.668 --> 01:07:47.773
Let's see, my friend Alan,
what do you say to my mom?

01:07:48.606 --> 01:07:51.307
"Hope you're having
a nice time."

01:07:51.309 --> 01:07:54.412
That's nice,
what else have we got?

01:08:00.318 --> 01:08:04.622
Tim, Kevin, I got
something to show you guys.

01:08:09.862 --> 01:08:11.697
I got something
to show you guys.

01:08:23.608 --> 01:08:25.474
Want me to roll
again for you or?

01:08:25.475 --> 01:08:26.577
Mm-hmm.

01:08:28.846 --> 01:08:32.582
Oh, man, it feels so good
to get a sleep in a bed again.

01:08:33.251 --> 01:08:35.620
My man!

01:08:36.988 --> 01:08:41.357
Well, boys, last day of
Man Camp. Let's make it count.

01:08:41.359 --> 01:08:43.292
- Hike up to the Hideaway.
- Yeah.

01:08:43.294 --> 01:08:45.627
Um, Alan, we're
low on water again.

01:08:45.630 --> 01:08:47.029
Would you mind
running down to the creek

01:08:47.032 --> 01:08:48.698
and filling us up
before we head out?

01:08:48.701 --> 01:08:50.803
Aces.

01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:53.604
Dick pic.

01:08:54.471 --> 01:08:56.573
Alan is sending dick pics.

01:08:57.776 --> 01:08:58.877
See for yourself.

01:09:03.613 --> 01:09:04.546
Are you sure that's him?

01:09:04.549 --> 01:09:06.049
It's an email from a week ago.

01:09:06.051 --> 01:09:08.051
Dude is sending dick pics.

01:09:08.053 --> 01:09:11.287
- Gross, is that it?
- What do you mean, is that it?

01:09:11.288 --> 01:09:14.390
I mean, it's gross that
you had see his situation, man,

01:09:14.392 --> 01:09:17.326
and thank you for bestowing
that honor on the rest of us,

01:09:17.328 --> 01:09:19.662
really, thanks, but you know,

01:09:19.663 --> 01:09:21.965
it's none of my business
if him and Mom want to,

01:09:21.966 --> 01:09:23.899
you know, do that.

01:09:23.902 --> 01:09:26.370
Yeah, wha... what's the big deal?

01:09:27.305 --> 01:09:31.006
Besides having forever
X-ray vision into Alan's pants?

01:09:31.009 --> 01:09:32.541
You know, that
doesn't affect us, so.

01:09:32.542 --> 01:09:33.910
Yeah, except that it does.

01:09:33.912 --> 01:09:35.613
He's not sending them to Mom.

01:09:36.546 --> 01:09:37.981
Check the outgoing message.

01:09:37.983 --> 01:09:39.752
He's sending them to
some lady named Sheila.

01:09:41.319 --> 01:09:42.685
"Wow, that's really big.

01:09:42.687 --> 01:09:44.654
You're going to
need to come over soon."

01:09:45.622 --> 01:09:46.724
What's the big deal?

01:09:54.833 --> 01:09:56.867
Alan, how could you do this?
How could you do this?

01:09:56.869 --> 01:09:58.367
We were blood
brothers in a guild.

01:09:58.369 --> 01:09:59.903
This isn't a joke, Kevin.
Mom's getting played.

01:09:59.905 --> 01:10:01.637
D&D is not a joke.

01:10:01.639 --> 01:10:03.706
- I'm calling Mom.
- Don't call her, okay?

01:10:03.708 --> 01:10:05.407
This is a face
to face conversation.

01:10:05.409 --> 01:10:06.742
We'll tell her when we get home.

01:10:06.744 --> 01:10:09.079
Tim, do not call her.

01:10:09.081 --> 01:10:09.982
Kevin, come on.

01:10:37.475 --> 01:10:39.943
You know, just for the record,

01:10:39.945 --> 01:10:42.946
I really like
being at the cabin. Oh.

01:10:42.948 --> 01:10:45.882
Last day of Man Camp, bud. We
hike up to the Hideaway, it's tradition.

01:10:45.884 --> 01:10:48.784
- Yeah, I know but I'm just getting a little winded here.
- Well, it's good for you.

01:10:48.786 --> 01:10:51.154
Gets the heart pumping, blood
flowing to the extremities.

01:10:51.156 --> 01:10:52.923
I think I need to
take a little breather.

01:10:52.925 --> 01:10:55.058
There's a lone peak that
opens up about a half mile.

01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:56.625
I'll meet you up there.

01:10:56.627 --> 01:10:59.830
You can't miss it,
bulges up from the ground.

01:10:59.832 --> 01:11:02.665
Strong, firm, ready to explode.

01:11:02.667 --> 01:11:03.900
You'll want a
pic of that for sure.

01:11:03.902 --> 01:11:06.136
- Dude.
- Lone peak.

01:11:06.138 --> 01:11:07.770
Meet you guys up there,

01:11:07.772 --> 01:11:09.908
right there in your face,
can't miss it.

01:11:15.848 --> 01:11:18.014
I'm thinking you
maybe should go next.

01:11:18.016 --> 01:11:18.884
I'll spot you.

01:11:20.618 --> 01:11:21.920
I always liked you, Alan.

01:11:32.998 --> 01:11:36.367
- Hey.
- Howdy, princess.

01:11:37.135 --> 01:11:38.667
Alan's getting
pretty gassed, I think.

01:11:38.669 --> 01:11:39.938
You mean step daddy dick pic?

01:11:40.973 --> 01:11:42.838
You got short term memory loss?

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:45.574
I'm not sitting around playing
pretend with that little perv, dude.

01:11:45.576 --> 01:11:48.546
I was actually starting to think it might
be nice to have him around, you know?

01:11:50.514 --> 01:11:51.649
Well, you want the truth?

01:11:52.885 --> 01:11:54.086
No time like the present.

01:11:55.753 --> 01:11:57.486
Hey, boys, there it is.

01:11:57.488 --> 01:11:59.157
The lone peak just as described.

01:12:00.524 --> 01:12:02.893
Whew, good lord.

01:12:02.895 --> 01:12:06.029
- Hey, buddy.
- Hello, Tim.

01:12:06.031 --> 01:12:09.067
Wasn't, uh, expecting you there.

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:12.168
Do you, uh,
do you need something?

01:12:12.170 --> 01:12:13.937
Me? No.

01:12:13.939 --> 01:12:14.805
No, I'm good.

01:12:16.341 --> 01:12:19.677
Yeah, I just didn't know if there was
anything you wanted to share with us?

01:12:21.046 --> 01:12:23.712
Uh, I don't know
what you're referring to.

01:12:23.714 --> 01:12:25.215
Nothing you want
to get off your chest?

01:12:25.217 --> 01:12:27.984
Maybe let us in the loop on?

01:12:27.986 --> 01:12:31.620
Um, oh, okay.

01:12:31.622 --> 01:12:32.721
Yeah, you got me.

01:12:32.723 --> 01:12:34.757
- You have no idea.
- No, you're right.

01:12:34.759 --> 01:12:37.160
I mean, I shouldn't have
tried to keep it to myself.

01:12:37.162 --> 01:12:40.796
Yeah, I'm saving it for your
mom and I, for this weekend.

01:12:40.798 --> 01:12:43.866
- What?
- Yeah, it's a Thai stick. But we...

01:12:43.868 --> 01:12:46.169
I don't give a shit about
your shitty little joint, Alan!

01:12:46.171 --> 01:12:48.639
I want you to tell us right now if
you've been cheating on our mom.

01:12:50.175 --> 01:12:51.776
- Cheating?
- We're brothers in a guild.

01:12:53.011 --> 01:12:54.010
How could you?

01:12:55.546 --> 01:12:57.082
You guys think that I
was cheating on your mother?

01:12:57.815 --> 01:13:00.118
Read my lips.

01:13:11.163 --> 01:13:13.829
- What?
- What do you mean, what?

01:13:13.831 --> 01:13:16.099
Well, you said read your lips,
and then you picked up a rock,

01:13:16.101 --> 01:13:17.267
and you threw it,
and you hit a...

01:13:17.269 --> 01:13:18.268
I know what I said!

01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:19.635
I think what he's trying to say,

01:13:19.637 --> 01:13:21.271
Alan, is we just
want to make sure

01:13:21.273 --> 01:13:23.906
that you're fully committed to
Mom, and there's not, like,

01:13:23.908 --> 01:13:26.608
some other stuff out there,
kind of floating around.

01:13:26.610 --> 01:13:28.144
You might want to
tell us about and be honest.

01:13:28.146 --> 01:13:29.145
Well, the answer is,

01:13:29.147 --> 01:13:30.913
there's absolutely no
one besides your mother

01:13:30.915 --> 01:13:31.880
that I would like to spend

01:13:31.882 --> 01:13:33.083
even a second of
the rest of my life with.

01:13:33.085 --> 01:13:36.186
That's really the way I feel,
and I don't appreciate you...

01:13:36.188 --> 01:13:38.587
You're so full of shit, dude.

01:13:38.589 --> 01:13:39.955
- Guys, what is this?
- Don't be such an asshole, man.

01:13:39.957 --> 01:13:41.992
You know what you did,
just admit it.

01:13:41.994 --> 01:13:45.097
I honestly have no idea what you
guys are talking about. Kevin?

01:13:45.930 --> 01:13:50.233
I'm so confused because
you're such a great guy, Alan,

01:13:50.235 --> 01:13:54.039
and you're, like,
pretty much my best friend...

01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:57.042
but the pictures on your phone.

01:13:59.677 --> 01:14:00.709
What?

01:14:00.711 --> 01:14:02.680
You heard what he said, we know.

01:14:06.118 --> 01:14:09.052
Guys, come on, that's something
that I can explain if you want...

01:14:09.054 --> 01:14:11.154
We don't need your
Goddamn explanation, man.

01:14:11.156 --> 01:14:13.123
Okay, we just want you
to get the hell out of here

01:14:13.125 --> 01:14:14.357
and leave our family alone.

01:14:14.359 --> 01:14:15.358
You know, if you would stop

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.993
this macho barbarian
bullshit for one second

01:14:17.995 --> 01:14:20.298
and just listen to what I
have to say, I can explain this.

01:14:21.366 --> 01:14:25.137
You leave
my mom alone.

01:14:26.371 --> 01:14:30.373
She's already married to someone
who even if he is six feet underground,

01:14:30.375 --> 01:14:32.610
is more of a man
than you'll ever be.

01:14:34.046 --> 01:14:36.148
Okay, okay.

01:14:39.217 --> 01:14:40.218
That's fine.

01:14:46.324 --> 01:14:50.226
You know,
I know that I'll never be

01:14:50.228 --> 01:14:52.095
what you guys want me to be,

01:14:52.097 --> 01:14:54.029
but did you ever
think for even a second

01:14:54.031 --> 01:14:56.199
that maybe your dad
wasn't perfect?

01:14:56.201 --> 01:14:58.068
Maybe that he actually
had some problems of his own?

01:14:58.070 --> 01:15:00.203
- Careful, man.
- You're old enough to know this,

01:15:00.205 --> 01:15:01.404
that this impossible standard

01:15:01.406 --> 01:15:04.076
that you're
holding me to is not real.

01:15:05.042 --> 01:15:07.210
Why don't you ask your mom
what really happened?

01:15:07.212 --> 01:15:09.814
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about your dad, Tim.

01:15:10.915 --> 01:15:12.350
He didn't have cancer, okay?

01:15:14.885 --> 01:15:16.053
It was liver failure.

01:15:17.021 --> 01:15:18.055
He was an alcoholic.

01:15:19.191 --> 01:15:21.124
But so what?

01:15:21.126 --> 01:15:22.225
I mean, that
doesn't change the fact

01:15:22.227 --> 01:15:24.127
that he was a great dad.

01:15:24.129 --> 01:15:25.694
But this superhuman person

01:15:25.696 --> 01:15:28.897
that you guys keep
comparing me to doesn't exist.

01:15:28.899 --> 01:15:30.732
He was broken
just like the rest of us,

01:15:30.734 --> 01:15:33.338
and you made him out
to be this person that...

01:15:35.307 --> 01:15:36.208
Get out.

01:15:37.875 --> 01:15:39.377
- I'm...
- Just go!

01:16:15.447 --> 01:16:18.046
- Shit.
- What?

01:16:18.048 --> 01:16:19.184
Alan had the poles.

01:16:40.272 --> 01:16:41.906
Cirrus cloud.

01:16:45.109 --> 01:16:46.909
It's more of a stratus.

01:16:46.911 --> 01:16:49.144
See, it's flat on top.

01:16:49.146 --> 01:16:50.014
Hmm.

01:16:54.151 --> 01:16:56.319
You think it's true
what Alan said about Dad?

01:16:56.321 --> 01:16:57.855
I don't know.

01:16:59.957 --> 01:17:01.859
Even if it was,
what would it change?

01:17:03.894 --> 01:17:04.762
Everything.

01:17:05.630 --> 01:17:07.796
He could've
still been here with us.

01:17:07.798 --> 01:17:09.900
It would've been
his fault that he's not.

01:17:10.768 --> 01:17:12.204
He could've given us more time.

01:17:15.172 --> 01:17:16.040
Yeah.

01:17:20.110 --> 01:17:21.446
It's crazy, you know...

01:17:23.847 --> 01:17:25.350
to see all your friends
grow up...

01:17:27.918 --> 01:17:30.888
get to know their parents,
you know, as people or whatever.

01:17:31.389 --> 01:17:33.425
We're never going
to get that with Dad.

01:17:34.992 --> 01:17:39.063
He's just, always
going to be a kid version.

01:17:41.065 --> 01:17:43.832
I know, like, a lot of that
stuff is shitty or whatever,

01:17:43.834 --> 01:17:47.104
but I just wish he
could see us as men, you know?

01:17:49.139 --> 01:17:51.909
I know after 12 years we should
be over it or whatever, but..

01:17:55.179 --> 01:17:58.283
I still miss him, every day.

01:18:01.319 --> 01:18:03.120
This new guy comes in and...

01:18:07.592 --> 01:18:08.993
I just want Dad.

01:18:11.529 --> 01:18:12.397
Me, too.

01:18:13.197 --> 01:18:14.098
Me, three.

01:18:16.401 --> 01:18:18.035
I do want Mom
to be happy though.

01:18:19.504 --> 01:18:21.238
Well, maybe she'll
find another guy next year.

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:24.039
Imagine if we
had a year to plan?

01:18:24.041 --> 01:18:27.111
Dude,
you're such a dick.

01:18:28.513 --> 01:18:32.983
You guys might hate me,
but I'm going to miss Alan.

01:18:34.619 --> 01:18:37.021
He was nice to have around.

01:18:37.555 --> 01:18:41.459
I know, Kevin,
he's not who we thought he was.

01:18:44.429 --> 01:18:46.298
I'm sure Mom will
find somebody else.

01:18:48.966 --> 01:18:50.568
Yeah, you're probably right.

01:18:55.607 --> 01:18:58.206
Ants, ants, ants!

01:18:58.208 --> 01:19:01.644
- Oh, oh shit.
- Dammit, Kevin!

01:19:01.646 --> 01:19:02.880
There's no ants, dude.

01:19:09.153 --> 01:19:10.087
What did you do?

01:19:11.989 --> 01:19:13.957
I may or may not
have sent the, uh...

01:19:17.061 --> 01:19:19.798
I was blinded by rage. There's
no way of knowing for sure.

01:19:28.238 --> 01:19:32.140
- Sweetie, I tried calling you all last night.
- Stay away from me!

01:19:32.142 --> 01:19:35.210
I don't want to hear it
from you, I just want you to go.

01:19:35.212 --> 01:19:37.112
But babe, I can
totally explain those pictures.

01:19:37.114 --> 01:19:38.980
Do not call me babe!

01:19:38.982 --> 01:19:42.217
- I thought you were a decent man.
- I am a decent man.

01:19:42.219 --> 01:19:43.619
No, no, no, save it!

01:19:43.621 --> 01:19:45.987
God, I should've known.

01:19:45.989 --> 01:19:49.224
I never should've gotten
involved with you.

01:19:49.226 --> 01:19:52.127
I found
the love of my life once,

01:19:52.129 --> 01:19:53.997
that should've been enough.

01:19:58.001 --> 01:20:01.136
I need you to
stay away from my boys, just...-

01:20:01.138 --> 01:20:03.073
just stay away from them!

01:20:04.041 --> 01:20:05.610
Kevin, get in the car!

01:20:06.378 --> 01:20:08.176
But I don't...
I don't have my stuff.

01:20:08.178 --> 01:20:11.915
No, Timmy and Adam
will bring it. Get in the car, now!

01:20:13.984 --> 01:20:15.052
See you, Kevin.

01:21:57.321 --> 01:21:59.755
<i>Do you suffer from
erectile dysfunction?</i>

01:21:59.757 --> 01:22:02.390
<i>Have you
suffered horrible side effects</i>

01:22:02.392 --> 01:22:04.392
<i>from brand name treatments?</i>

01:22:04.394 --> 01:22:06.294
<i>If you're ready to
try something different</i>

01:22:06.296 --> 01:22:11.066
<i>and get your sex life back,
call me, Dr. Sheila Sterns today.</i>

01:22:11.068 --> 01:22:13.769
<i>You can call
anytime, day or night.</i>

01:22:13.771 --> 01:22:16.674
<i>Or call our 24 hour
hotline, I will pick up.</i>

01:22:18.375 --> 01:22:19.376
Oh, shit.

01:22:22.614 --> 01:22:23.648
Oh, shit.

01:22:31.288 --> 01:22:33.390
- What's up, bro?
- <i>Sheila is a dick doctor.</i>

01:22:35.158 --> 01:22:36.559
- Shut up.
- <i>No, dude.</i>

01:22:36.561 --> 01:22:40.530
<i>I just literally saw a commercial
on TV. I called the hotline,</i>

01:22:40.532 --> 01:22:42.264
and they said
you could literally

01:22:42.266 --> 01:22:44.466
send her a
picture of your penis.

01:22:44.468 --> 01:22:46.401
Think about it,
he sends a picture.

01:22:46.403 --> 01:22:49.237
She says, "That's so big,
you need to come in right now."

01:22:49.239 --> 01:22:51.206
Holy shit, you're right.

01:22:51.208 --> 01:22:52.140
What are we going to do?

01:22:52.142 --> 01:22:54.077
Well, we got to fix it, now.

01:22:54.612 --> 01:22:55.510
What time are
you up in the morning?

01:22:55.512 --> 01:22:56.746
<i>Don't you have
classes or something?</i>

01:22:56.748 --> 01:22:57.647
<i>Dude, I've had enough credits</i>

01:22:57.649 --> 01:22:59.615
<i>to graduate for
a year and a half.</i>

01:22:59.617 --> 01:23:02.685
Wow, uh, okay.

01:23:02.687 --> 01:23:06.288
Um, so are you going to, like,
use your degree for your job or?

01:23:06.290 --> 01:23:07.890
- Don't push it, bro.
- <i>Right, right, right.</i>

01:23:07.892 --> 01:23:10.626
- What time?
- Uh, how 'about seven? Pick you up at seven?

01:23:10.628 --> 01:23:12.462
- Be here at four.
- That's in, like, an hour.

01:23:16.834 --> 01:23:19.869
I knew it, I knew Alan
would never send sex mails

01:23:19.871 --> 01:23:21.003
to some woman named Sheila.

01:23:21.005 --> 01:23:24.205
Yeah, Kevin, I think we
all got a little carried away.

01:23:24.207 --> 01:23:25.641
Now, if it were Katie.

01:23:25.643 --> 01:23:28.243
Stop talking about my wife.
Here's the plan.

01:23:28.245 --> 01:23:29.544
Kevin, you know
Alan better than anybody,

01:23:29.546 --> 01:23:31.246
so you and Tim
are going to go find him,

01:23:31.248 --> 01:23:32.848
apologize,
and bring him back here.

01:23:32.850 --> 01:23:34.584
Apologize?

01:23:34.586 --> 01:23:36.184
I don't know what that means.

01:23:36.186 --> 01:23:37.720
Just do it, asshole.

01:23:37.722 --> 01:23:38.790
Sounds good to me.

01:23:41.926 --> 01:23:43.759
- Let's do it.
- Put the sword down, Kev.

01:23:43.761 --> 01:23:45.828
So, where are we going?

01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:48.465
It's 11:30, Tuesday afternoon.

01:23:49.634 --> 01:23:51.266
Do I have to
spell it out for you?

01:23:51.268 --> 01:23:52.434
From the top and punch.

01:23:52.436 --> 01:23:53.803
Yes, oh, you're doing so good.

01:23:53.805 --> 01:23:55.638
Show me that body, yes!

01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:57.940
Knee, double knee,
harder, harder, Leslie!

01:23:57.942 --> 01:23:59.474
Harder, not that hard, Leslie.

01:23:59.476 --> 01:24:01.576
Don't poop on the floor,
don't poop on the floor.

01:24:01.578 --> 01:24:03.511
Elbow, one, two. Do it again.

01:24:03.513 --> 01:24:05.681
If somebody comes to
attack you, what do you do?

01:24:05.683 --> 01:24:07.950
We take it from
the punch and over.

01:24:07.952 --> 01:24:09.752
And over, keep going, yes!

01:24:09.754 --> 01:24:12.287
Up, yes, keep going.

01:24:12.289 --> 01:24:14.589
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God!

01:24:14.591 --> 01:24:16.591
- Whoa!
- No, no!

01:24:16.593 --> 01:24:20.362
I don't think I'm ready to die, please don't, I'm innocent!

01:24:20.364 --> 01:24:24.134
- Oh, my God.
- Go down, Mimi boy.

01:24:24.969 --> 01:24:26.669
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

01:24:26.671 --> 01:24:29.506
This is normal!
This is normal!

01:24:30.207 --> 01:24:32.908
Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up!

01:24:40.685 --> 01:24:43.286
Seven, eight, and one, and two.

01:24:47.424 --> 01:24:49.459
Yeah. So.

01:24:50.427 --> 01:24:53.628
Well, I feel like a B-I-T-C-H.

01:24:53.630 --> 01:24:54.629
It's not your fault.

01:24:54.631 --> 01:24:56.266
You know, we kind of set you up.

01:24:56.968 --> 01:24:58.834
The good news is,
now things can go back

01:24:58.836 --> 01:25:00.568
to the way they
were before, you know?

01:25:00.570 --> 01:25:02.537
You really think he's
going to take me back after me

01:25:02.539 --> 01:25:07.509
treating him like a
sexual predator for three weeks?

01:25:07.511 --> 01:25:08.744
Yeah, totally.

01:25:08.746 --> 01:25:12.247
- Chill, it's okay, we're helping.
- What the hell?

01:25:12.249 --> 01:25:13.716
You can breathe,

01:25:13.718 --> 01:25:15.851
if you can talk,
you can breathe.

01:25:15.853 --> 01:25:17.720
Okay, okay, okay.

01:25:17.722 --> 01:25:20.255
Sorry, Al.

01:25:20.257 --> 01:25:21.556
Oh, that's okay.

01:25:21.558 --> 01:25:23.695
- Oh, sweetie.
- So, happy family, huh?

01:25:24.494 --> 01:25:25.828
- Listen...
- Look...

01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:27.562
No, you start.

01:25:27.564 --> 01:25:32.001
I am so sorry,
I feel like a complete fool.

01:25:32.003 --> 01:25:35.472
- If you want nothing to do with me, I completely...
- Shh, shh, shh.

01:25:36.007 --> 01:25:38.673
I waited 53 years to find
someone to fall in love with.

01:25:38.675 --> 01:25:40.475
I don't think
I have another 53 years

01:25:40.477 --> 01:25:42.544
to wait to see if it
happens again.

01:25:42.546 --> 01:25:44.013
I love you.

01:25:44.015 --> 01:25:46.249
- I love you.
- Mm.

01:25:49.821 --> 01:25:51.453
Cut him free, dude.

01:25:51.455 --> 01:25:53.555
What, so they can do whatever
they want with their hands?

01:25:53.557 --> 01:25:55.024
No dice, bro.

01:25:55.026 --> 01:25:56.326
Let's go.

01:26:04.769 --> 01:26:06.369
Happy family.

01:26:28.059 --> 01:26:30.025
Go!

01:26:30.027 --> 01:26:32.696
It's okay.

01:26:37.334 --> 01:26:38.468
- Hey.
- Hey, Kev.

01:26:39.469 --> 01:26:40.570
What happened to the cape?

01:26:42.539 --> 01:26:43.775
I don't need it anymore.

01:26:47.577 --> 01:26:48.678
To Alan.

01:26:49.113 --> 01:26:50.280
To Dad.

01:26:51.681 --> 01:26:52.682
To family.

01:26:58.522 --> 01:27:00.490
Hey, Tim.

01:27:01.591 --> 01:27:02.927
She's right behind me,
isn't she?

01:27:04.095 --> 01:27:06.528
- Christy.
- I was just coming over to say hi,

01:27:06.530 --> 01:27:07.997
and see how you're doing.

01:27:07.999 --> 01:27:09.564
- Really good.
- Good.

01:27:09.566 --> 01:27:11.000
Uh, your mom said
college is going great.

01:27:11.002 --> 01:27:13.468
Yeah.

01:27:13.470 --> 01:27:16.404
She keeps talking about it.

01:27:16.406 --> 01:27:21.311
Um, all right,
well, have a good night.

01:27:23.713 --> 01:27:24.581
You, too.

01:27:26.884 --> 01:27:27.751
Hold this.

01:27:28.718 --> 01:27:30.353
I thought she was gross?

01:27:30.888 --> 01:27:32.787
Don't be stupid.

01:27:32.789 --> 01:27:33.925
She's the perfect woman.

01:27:34.926 --> 01:27:37.059
That's why I
could never be with her.

01:27:37.061 --> 01:27:38.062
It'd be all over.

01:27:39.696 --> 01:27:40.697
So?

01:27:42.166 --> 01:27:43.868
I don't know,
maybe it's too late.

01:27:44.801 --> 01:27:47.571
Kevin, tell him
what you told me.

01:27:49.606 --> 01:27:52.074
The only place where
dreams become impossible

01:27:52.076 --> 01:27:53.643
is in your own mind.

01:27:56.613 --> 01:27:57.480
Go get them.

01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:09.927
Hey, um...

01:28:10.928 --> 01:28:12.930
- I think she has a boyfriend.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:28:14.899 --> 01:28:16.766
Let's just let it play out.

01:28:18.602 --> 01:28:21.070
I kept those letters.

01:28:21.072 --> 01:28:23.105
Oh, I'm sure they're awful.

01:28:23.107 --> 01:28:25.375
Pretty good,
one in particular was like...

01:28:26.810 --> 01:28:31.082
"Roses are red, violets are
blue, I want to kiss you."

01:28:31.883 --> 01:28:33.481
Okay, um...

01:28:33.483 --> 01:28:35.885
Hey, hey, that's my
girlfriend, you son of a bitch!

01:28:35.887 --> 01:28:37.152
It's too late, it's too late!

01:28:37.154 --> 01:28:39.054
- Not now, Christy.
- Stop, stop, stop.

01:28:39.056 --> 01:28:40.155
Andrew!

01:28:49.666 --> 01:28:52.201
No, no, no, no.
Go to sleep, go to sleep.

01:28:52.203 --> 01:28:54.537
Go, buddy, go, go, go.

01:28:57.774 --> 01:29:00.209
That's two, well, let's party!
