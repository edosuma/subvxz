...down 24 points in light trading,
62 million shares,

00:27.319 --> 00:30.055
declines outnumber advances,
three to two.

00:30.155 --> 00:32.891
New claims for unemployment benefits
rose 45,000

00:32.991 --> 00:36.228
in the fourth week of April to 455,000.

00:36.328 --> 00:39.231
The number of persons
collecting benefits rose 39,000.

00:39.331 --> 00:41.692
They still are running
at about three-and-a-half million.

00:41.792 --> 00:44.653
The weekly jobless claims figures
are the earliest indication we get

00:44.753 --> 00:47.865
of how the economy is doing
and will give any early signal

00:47.965 --> 00:51.201
when the economy begins
to come out of recession.

00:51.301 --> 00:52.786
Gold, up $1.20.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.810
The afternoon fixing
in London at 356.85.

00:58.267 --> 01:00.502
Jeez!

01:00.602 --> 01:01.694
Oh, shit!

01:08.485 --> 01:10.888
International communications
is the most active issue.

01:10.988 --> 01:12.931
It's down a dollar at 47.

01:13.031 --> 01:15.726
US Amalgamated is down a half at 29.

01:15.826 --> 01:18.645
The biggest move of the day,
Bolt Enterprises.

01:18.745 --> 01:21.899
The stock is up $6.82,
sparked by reports

01:21.999 --> 01:25.152
that Goddard Bolt intends
to purchase a prime section

01:25.252 --> 01:27.755
of Downtown Los Angeles real estate.

01:31.883 --> 01:33.744
'Morning, Mr. Bolt.

01:33.844 --> 01:35.346
'Morning.

01:37.264 --> 01:38.415
- 'Morning.
- 'Morning.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.017
'Morning.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.799
- 'Morning.
- 'Morning.

01:47.899 --> 01:49.300
'Morning.

02:04.965 --> 02:07.986
'Morning.

02:38.075 --> 02:41.646
'Morning.

02:41.746 --> 02:43.805
'Morning.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.303
Gentlemen, let's go to work!

03:14.403 --> 03:15.404
Pritchard.

03:16.071 --> 03:19.016
How are we doing
with our development in Brazil?

03:19.116 --> 03:24.771
Mr. Bolt, we just learned that in order
to build Club Bolt the way you envision,

03:24.871 --> 03:29.627
we'd be forced to cut down 6,000 acres
of natural Brazilian rain forest.

03:30.127 --> 03:31.174
So?

03:32.504 --> 03:37.726
Sir, the last 400 remaining Ipi Indians
left in the world are still living there.

03:39.094 --> 03:40.141
So?

03:41.972 --> 03:45.250
Sir, if we cut down their forest,

03:45.350 --> 03:49.355
we'd have to displace them,
and they could cause trouble.

03:51.481 --> 03:54.092
Well, they're not gonna
want to live there anymore anyway.

03:54.192 --> 03:55.239
Why not?

03:55.527 --> 03:56.528
No shade.

03:59.781 --> 04:02.034
How are we doing with
our new development in Florida?

04:03.160 --> 04:07.165
Well, sir, we are having
a slight problem in Fort Lauderdale.

04:07.330 --> 04:12.177
In order to make room for the magnificent,
largest-in-the-world Bolt shopping mall,

04:12.294 --> 04:15.173
we're going to have to
tear down a nursing home for the aged.

04:15.672 --> 04:16.673
So?

04:18.216 --> 04:21.327
Well, at present, there are
180 very old people living there.

04:21.428 --> 04:25.228
And we understand that most of them
are invalids, who are bedridden and dying.

04:25.807 --> 04:26.854
So?

04:29.519 --> 04:31.146
It wouldn't look good in the papers.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.816
I get your point.

04:36.234 --> 04:37.861
Do it late at night.

04:38.779 --> 04:39.826
Excellent!

04:43.867 --> 04:46.416
Gentlemen, I have a little surprise.

04:47.788 --> 04:48.772
Follow me.

04:48.872 --> 04:50.857
- What is this?
- It looks like a slum area.

04:50.957 --> 04:53.193
You are looking at
two-and-a-half square miles

04:53.293 --> 04:56.947
of the most derelict,
dilapidated section of Los Angeles.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.574
Right now, I own half of this property.

04:59.674 --> 05:01.201
The city owns the other half.

05:01.301 --> 05:04.555
But by noon tomorrow,
it will all be mine.

05:05.806 --> 05:06.898
What is that?

05:07.390 --> 05:09.893
One of those little bums
that live down there.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.297
I suppose you're wondering
why Goddard Bolt

05:14.397 --> 05:18.969
is prepared to pay up to $4 billion
to own this worthless pile of refuse.

05:19.069 --> 05:21.138
Am I right?

05:21.238 --> 05:25.809
Well, we would never presume to question
your genius for financial wizardry, sir.

05:25.909 --> 05:27.126
But why?

05:28.745 --> 05:30.213
Wait.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.872
Gentlemen,
the ultimate achievement of my life!

05:46.972 --> 05:48.206
Bolt Center!

05:48.306 --> 05:49.499
It's absolutely visionary!

05:49.599 --> 05:50.584
Fantastic!

05:50.684 --> 05:52.085
Incredible!

05:52.185 --> 05:56.440
Gentlemen, you'll never know
how much this project excites me!

06:01.987 --> 06:03.847
Mr. Bolt, you have a surprise visitor.

06:03.947 --> 06:05.915
- Who is it?
- Vance Crasswell, sir.

06:06.157 --> 06:07.704
Crasswell! Damn it!

06:12.622 --> 06:14.374
Thank you. Let's go.

06:16.084 --> 06:19.304
Excuse me. Am I interrupting?

06:20.505 --> 06:22.032
I'm interrupting.

06:22.132 --> 06:23.867
I'm interrupting. I should leave.

06:23.967 --> 06:26.311
Should I leave? I'm gonna leave.

06:28.013 --> 06:29.105
Can I come in?

06:29.264 --> 06:30.265
Hello, Vance.

06:30.807 --> 06:33.043
You know my attorneys,
Pritchard, Knowles, Stevens.

06:33.143 --> 06:35.771
The three wise men. Hiya, fellas.

06:36.146 --> 06:37.380
What's goin' on?

06:37.480 --> 06:38.857
Oh, my God!

06:39.482 --> 06:40.859
Oh, my God!

06:41.234 --> 06:45.159
Someone else's idea of what to do
with the Downtown slum district.

06:45.530 --> 06:46.656
Would you...

06:48.158 --> 06:50.185
Why didn't they tell me
Goddard Bolt owned the other half?

06:50.285 --> 06:52.333
I never would've bought it.

06:52.662 --> 06:56.399
No one beats Goddard Bolt when it comes
to financial wheeling and dealing.

06:56.499 --> 07:00.195
Now, look. I'm in way over my head here.

07:00.295 --> 07:03.799
I'm sorry to have wasted your time,
gentlemen.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.015
Mr. Bolt.

07:08.887 --> 07:10.139
Can I ask you a question?

07:10.805 --> 07:12.022
Let me buy your half of the property.

07:13.224 --> 07:15.961
Give you $2 billion,
4% of the profit for the next 20 years.

07:16.061 --> 07:17.128
No.

07:17.228 --> 07:18.821
- 5%.
- No.

07:19.356 --> 07:20.983
- 6%.
- Stop.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.366
Stopped.

07:22.859 --> 07:26.079
Vance, why don't you let me buy you out?

07:26.321 --> 07:27.368
Look at us.

07:27.697 --> 07:30.291
An office is no place to do business.

07:32.243 --> 07:33.711
I have a much better idea.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.717
Now, isn't this better?

07:39.209 --> 07:41.528
At least we can see
what we're dealing with.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.801
Okay. Final offer.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.969
I want this property.

07:49.386 --> 07:50.512
I want it.

07:51.721 --> 07:55.771
Just so happens I grew up
five blocks from where we're standing.

07:57.394 --> 07:58.896
I'm all right.

08:00.522 --> 08:03.492
Right in the middle
of this godforsaken slum.

08:04.150 --> 08:07.950
It's been my life-long dream
to come back here and rebuild it.

08:09.572 --> 08:11.141
It's okay. You can laugh.

08:11.241 --> 08:12.934
I don't expect you
to understand my feelings.

08:13.034 --> 08:14.911
After all, you're a rich man's son.

08:15.036 --> 08:16.813
You were born into money.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.982
What, are you kidding?
My father left me $5 million.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.150
That's nothing.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.652
No, no, no. Nothing is nothing!

08:22.752 --> 08:25.596
These people down here have nothing!
Zero!

08:26.631 --> 08:29.117
Look, I don't want
to hurt your feelings.

08:29.217 --> 08:31.470
You? You couldn't survive
10 minutes down here.

08:31.803 --> 08:32.996
Don't be ridiculous.

08:33.096 --> 08:34.938
I would survive anywhere.

08:35.097 --> 08:36.315
Right.

08:36.975 --> 08:38.568
Without your money
and your credit cards?

08:39.059 --> 08:40.169
Yes.

08:40.270 --> 08:43.590
Without identifying yourself
to anyone as Goddard Bolt?

08:43.690 --> 08:44.862
Yes.

08:45.275 --> 08:46.635
For a modest period of time.

08:46.735 --> 08:49.454
I don't know, let's say 30 days?

08:50.363 --> 08:51.455
Absolutely!

08:52.949 --> 08:54.292
It's a bet.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.123
Bet?

08:56.619 --> 08:57.996
What are you talking about?

08:58.455 --> 08:59.689
Well, what you just said.

08:59.789 --> 09:03.860
That you could survive down here without
using any of your resources for 30 days.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.987
And if you do it,
you get my half of the property.

09:06.087 --> 09:08.966
You don't do it, I'm gonna get yours.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.553
I'm sorry, wasn't that the bet?

09:17.515 --> 09:20.894
You conniving son-of-a-bitch.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.114
Yes!

09:26.566 --> 09:27.943
It's a bet.

09:28.985 --> 09:31.329
You've underestimated me, Vance.

09:31.446 --> 09:32.823
I can do it!

09:33.615 --> 09:36.243
You can't do it! You'll never make it!

09:36.618 --> 09:38.603
This is insane. This is crazy!

09:38.703 --> 09:39.896
You'll never survive!

09:39.996 --> 09:41.748
Pritchard, be quiet.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.175
- Fergueson, go on.
- Thank you.

09:44.334 --> 09:47.654
Now, if you leave the prescribed slum area
or try to remove this ankle alarm,

09:47.754 --> 09:49.051
it will go off.

09:49.214 --> 09:53.076
And if we receive a sustained alarm signal
for more than 30 seconds,

09:53.176 --> 09:54.744
you'll forfeit the bet.

09:54.844 --> 09:58.081
After 30 days, the alarm
will automatically deactivate.

09:58.181 --> 09:59.649
Are these conditions understood?

10:00.100 --> 10:01.101
Understood.

10:01.518 --> 10:02.940
And we have your word on that.

10:03.228 --> 10:05.356
Yes, you have my word on it.

10:05.980 --> 10:10.201
Pritchard, I'm giving you and your partners
my power of attorney.

10:10.360 --> 10:14.365
I'm trusting you to look after
all my legal affairs for the next 30 days.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.728
Take it. Take it all.

10:19.828 --> 10:21.455
I won't need anything.

10:22.539 --> 10:24.712
And you won't need this either.

10:28.002 --> 10:29.279
What are you doing?

10:29.379 --> 10:32.508
Have to make sure no one recognizes you.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.430
That was stitched in.

10:37.387 --> 10:38.889
Give me a comb.

10:43.893 --> 10:46.629
Mr. Bolt, I don't think you realize
what you're getting into!

10:46.729 --> 10:48.006
You've never slept in the street before.

10:48.106 --> 10:49.591
You've never eaten out of garbage cans.

10:49.691 --> 10:51.051
You're used to a hearty breakfast.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.218
This is ludicrous.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.803
Look at you without your toupee.

10:53.903 --> 10:57.307
You look like somebody
who only makes $50,000 a year.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.893
Mr. Bolt, please don't do this.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.312
Let me suggest you wait 24 hours.

11:02.412 --> 11:04.147
Yes, at least sleep on it.

11:04.247 --> 11:05.999
I've given my word.

11:06.249 --> 11:08.359
Do you want me to go back on my word?

11:08.459 --> 11:09.986
Would you go back on your word?

11:10.086 --> 11:12.088
Certainly. We're lawyers.

11:13.965 --> 11:15.842
Give me that contract.

11:26.728 --> 11:29.607
Okay, Goddard, here we are.

11:30.356 --> 11:31.608
Come on.

11:33.693 --> 11:39.015
Now, in 30 days,
at the exact moment of sunset,

11:39.115 --> 11:42.310
all of this property
is going to be yours or mine.

11:42.410 --> 11:45.129
Either way, I think we should
have a big party at my house.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.065
Let's make it at my house.

11:47.165 --> 11:48.883
Okay, your house.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.261
For the look.

11:56.799 --> 11:57.846
Thanks.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.012
Let's get out of here.

12:11.189 --> 12:14.384
It's going to be hot,
H-O-T, with a capital "H,"

12:14.484 --> 12:16.136
for at least the next few days.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.720
Do whatever you can to keep cool.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.889
And for the low tonight,
we're not going to get much relief.

12:19.989 --> 12:23.163
It's only going to get down
to maybe the high 80s.

12:25.328 --> 12:27.063
The pressure system
coming in from the desert,

12:27.163 --> 12:28.481
it looks like we're not going
to get that.

12:28.581 --> 12:29.732
I've been telling you about that.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.631
Unfortunately,
that's not going to happen.

12:44.305 --> 12:45.522
"Ooms."

12:59.988 --> 13:01.014
Excuse me.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.661
$2.50 a night.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.911
Check-out 11:00 a.m. You pay in advance.

13:07.495 --> 13:08.897
May I see the room first?

13:08.997 --> 13:10.356
Yeah. Right behind me,
through those curtains.

13:10.456 --> 13:11.878
Take a look.

13:24.345 --> 13:26.456
It's rather crowded, isn't it?

13:26.556 --> 13:28.900
Yeah. We get good word-of-mouth.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.897
Do you have a single room?

13:36.899 --> 13:38.401
With or without a Jacuzzi?

13:40.111 --> 13:43.536
Look, I got one bed left.
You want it or not? Make up your mind.

13:44.032 --> 13:45.058
I'll take it.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.081
Here, sign the register.

13:53.833 --> 13:57.258
- What was that, a roach?
- No, a mouse. Just a baby.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.764
Look, that's $2.50 in advance.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.680
$2.50. $2.50.

14:04.552 --> 14:07.021
Could we have a private conversation?
Just entre nous?

14:09.432 --> 14:10.750
All right.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.920
Listen, I'm not really a derelict.
I'm down here on a wager.

14:14.020 --> 14:18.617
I happen to be one of the richest men
in the country, if not the richest.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.614
The richest?

14:20.860 --> 14:22.804
Yes. And if you give me a bed tonight,

14:22.904 --> 14:27.125
at the end of this month,
I will give you $10,000.

14:30.953 --> 14:33.547
All right. I'll up the ante.

14:34.123 --> 14:35.625
$20,000.

14:38.503 --> 14:41.177
Now you're talkin'. $20,000.

14:41.756 --> 14:43.850
Look, I'll give you a break.

14:44.509 --> 14:47.809
I don't need the whole $20,000 tonight.

14:48.471 --> 14:52.192
But if you give me
$2.50 as a down payment,

14:52.809 --> 14:54.127
the bed is yours.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.901
Otherwise, get the hell outta here!

16:00.501 --> 16:02.174
Who is it?

16:02.587 --> 16:04.214
Please let me in.

16:04.547 --> 16:05.948
I need shelter.

16:06.048 --> 16:10.394
I'm sorry. We're closed, my son.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.398
But I haven't eaten all day.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.312
I need food.

16:16.809 --> 16:20.188
We'll be open in the morning, my son.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.608
You don't understand.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.636
I don't have a place to sleep!

16:26.736 --> 16:29.472
I'm tired, very tired. Very.

16:29.572 --> 16:31.182
Please, please let me in.

16:31.282 --> 16:32.975
Please, let me in!

16:33.075 --> 16:35.144
Now, listen, you're waking everybody up!

16:35.244 --> 16:38.314
Now, you get outta here,
or I'll call the police!

16:38.414 --> 16:40.041
My son.

17:07.068 --> 17:08.694
Thank God.

17:42.895 --> 17:43.987
Hey!

17:44.689 --> 17:46.487
Jeez, you scared me!

17:46.983 --> 17:48.885
I didn't know anybody was under there!

17:48.985 --> 17:50.703
I always go here.

17:51.112 --> 17:52.739
I thought I saw someone,

17:52.947 --> 17:55.541
but then I thought it was
a frigment of my imagination.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.330
Why don't you look first?

17:57.994 --> 17:59.395
Yeah. You're right. You're right.

17:59.495 --> 18:01.213
Sorry.

18:02.373 --> 18:04.000
You almost hit me. That's disgusting!

18:05.293 --> 18:06.277
It is?

18:06.377 --> 18:07.424
Yes, it is!

18:07.795 --> 18:09.197
Why don't you use a handkerchief?

18:09.297 --> 18:11.324
Handkerchief?
I ain't got a handkerchief.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.926
I don't think I ever had a handkerchief.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.162
Here, take this.

18:16.262 --> 18:19.457
Gee, thanks.
Nobody down here ever gives you nothin'.

18:19.557 --> 18:21.184
You're all right.

18:26.022 --> 18:27.148
What are you doin'?

18:27.690 --> 18:31.069
P-E-P-T-O. Pepto!

18:31.444 --> 18:32.762
- What?
- It's hard to read backwards,

18:32.862 --> 18:34.580
but that's what it says. Pepto.

18:34.905 --> 18:38.034
You must have slept
on a Pepto-Bismol box.

18:38.242 --> 18:39.368
See?

18:40.328 --> 18:41.312
Yeah.

18:41.412 --> 18:44.211
Don't! Don't!
Don't rub it off. It's nice.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.942
That's a nice name, Pepto.

18:46.042 --> 18:47.443
I'm Sailor.

18:47.543 --> 18:50.387
Everybody calls me Sailor
'cause I was nearly in the Navy.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.532
Yeah, that's nice.

18:52.632 --> 18:55.260
Yeah, they wouldn't take me
'cause they said I had pleurilsy.

18:56.677 --> 18:58.204
Very nice meeting you.

18:58.304 --> 18:59.455
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well, goodbye.

18:59.555 --> 19:00.581
- Bye-bye. Nice to see you.
- Bye-bye.

19:00.681 --> 19:01.728
Bye.

19:03.684 --> 19:05.061
I just gave you a handkerchief.

19:06.228 --> 19:07.964
Yeah, but it's got initials.

19:08.064 --> 19:09.782
You can't blow snot in initials.

19:10.566 --> 19:12.568
- See you.
- Yeah. See you.

19:26.082 --> 19:27.483
Excuse me. I wonder...

19:27.583 --> 19:29.735
Could you tell me
where I could get something to eat?

19:29.835 --> 19:30.861
Don't ask me, pal.

19:30.961 --> 19:33.931
I don't know where
my next meal's comin' from.

19:48.771 --> 19:50.798
Get the hell outta here!

19:50.898 --> 19:53.968
I told all you goddamn bums,
I don't want you hanging around here.

19:54.068 --> 19:56.992
You gonna make it look like
a low-class place.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.378
Give to a poor blind man.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.636
Give to a poor blind man.

20:21.178 --> 20:24.352
Man, don't even think about it.

20:42.491 --> 20:43.663
Yeah!

20:58.507 --> 20:59.575
Good morning, sir.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.786
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Get away from my car!
What are you doing?

21:01.886 --> 21:03.245
I'm just cleaning your windshield, sir.

21:03.345 --> 21:06.189
Cleaning my windshield?
You made it worse!

21:07.600 --> 21:10.194
- There, that better?
- Wonderful.

21:11.020 --> 21:12.046
Can I have a dollar, please?

21:12.146 --> 21:14.215
Would you get away? Nothing's free!

21:14.315 --> 21:15.424
My hand!

21:15.524 --> 21:17.843
Wait! Wait! Wait, I'm caught!

21:17.943 --> 21:20.537
I'm caught. Wait, wait! Stop!

21:20.988 --> 21:22.661
Forget the dollar!

21:23.657 --> 21:25.601
Hot-too! Hot-too!
Ziggety beam bomb boom!

21:25.701 --> 21:26.953
Hot-too!

21:27.912 --> 21:29.730
Hot-too! Hot-too!
Ziggety beam bomb boom!

21:29.830 --> 21:31.047

21:31.791 --> 21:33.651
Hot-too! Hot-too!
Ziggety beam bomb boom!

21:33.751 --> 21:35.003
Hot-too!

21:35.711 --> 21:37.655
Hot-too! Hot-too!
Ziggety beam bomb boom!

21:37.755 --> 21:39.007
Hot-too!

21:52.061 --> 21:53.358
A penny.

21:58.234 --> 22:00.136
Hot-too, hot-too!
Ziggety beam bomb boom!

22:00.236 --> 22:01.453
Hot-too!

22:02.238 --> 22:04.181
Hot-too! Hot-too!
Ziggety beam bomb boom!

22:04.281 --> 22:05.533
Hot-too!

22:06.325 --> 22:08.227
Hot-too! Hot-too!
Ziggety beam bomb boom!

22:08.327 --> 22:09.579
Hot-too!

22:10.329 --> 22:12.231
Hot-too! Hot-too!
Ziggety beam bomb boom!

22:12.331 --> 22:13.583
Hot-too!

22:14.291 --> 22:16.152
Hot-too! Hot-too!
Ziggety beam bomb boom!

22:16.252 --> 22:17.504
Hot-too!

22:18.963 --> 22:20.698
Hot-too! Hot-too!
Ziggety beam bomb boom!

22:20.798 --> 22:22.050
Hot-too!

22:22.633 --> 22:24.368
Hot-too! Hot-too!
Ziggety beam bomb boom!

22:24.468 --> 22:26.345
Hot-too! Hot-too!

22:26.762 --> 22:28.205
Hot-too! Hot-too...

22:28.305 --> 22:29.602
Hot-too...

22:31.934 --> 22:33.151
Hot-too!

22:50.077 --> 22:51.145
Excuse me!

22:51.245 --> 22:52.480
What do you want?

22:52.580 --> 22:53.814
I want to get past.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.858
- You want to get past?
- Yeah.

22:55.958 --> 22:58.527
He wants to get past!

22:58.627 --> 22:59.799
Get past!

23:00.629 --> 23:01.972
Get past. Get past.

23:02.464 --> 23:03.590
Come on, get past!

23:03.841 --> 23:05.058
Get past. Get past.

23:06.135 --> 23:07.745
Hey!

23:07.845 --> 23:09.222
Help! Help!

23:15.144 --> 23:16.378
Hey, get his shoes!

23:16.478 --> 23:17.588
Hey! What the... Hey!

23:17.688 --> 23:18.735
Okay, shoes!

23:18.856 --> 23:19.840
Hey! Hey!

23:19.940 --> 23:21.884
He's kicking me! Would you choke him?

23:21.984 --> 23:23.219
- Help! Help!
- Hold him!

23:23.319 --> 23:24.741
Help! Help!

23:38.167 --> 23:39.965
You no-good scumbags!

23:40.836 --> 23:42.804
You stay away from here!

23:43.255 --> 23:44.928
Those dirty bastards.

23:54.308 --> 23:55.651
Thank you.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.357
I didn't do that for you!

23:58.145 --> 23:59.738
Those pigs invaded my territory!

24:01.315 --> 24:04.093
I'm very territorial.

24:04.193 --> 24:06.036
Yeah, I noticed that.

24:07.571 --> 24:11.701
Gee, they would have killed me!
Just for my shoes!

24:12.034 --> 24:13.627
They're animals!

24:14.119 --> 24:17.231
They tried that on me
when I first came down here.

24:17.331 --> 24:19.650
They jumped me.

24:19.750 --> 24:21.735
Big mistake!

24:21.835 --> 24:24.113
Nobody messes with Molly.

24:24.213 --> 24:27.199
I grabbed that big guy,
Mean Victor, by the apricots!

24:27.299 --> 24:32.037
And I twisted, and I twisted,
and I twisted!

24:32.137 --> 24:34.582
- Know what I mean?
- I do. I...

24:34.682 --> 24:36.275
I know what you mean.

24:36.433 --> 24:39.027
Good! This is my place.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.280
I live alone.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.287
You still here?

24:58.580 --> 25:00.253
I don't have any shoes!

25:03.585 --> 25:05.946
Who are you?
What are you doin' down here anyway?

25:06.046 --> 25:07.093
It's complicated.

25:07.214 --> 25:09.199
Don't tell me! Don't tell me!

25:09.299 --> 25:11.051
I don't wanna know.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.431
What are you, about a nine-and-a-half D?

25:16.098 --> 25:17.291
Yes, exactly.

25:17.391 --> 25:19.189
Yes! I'm never wrong.

25:19.643 --> 25:21.441
Come here. Come here.

25:25.274 --> 25:27.777
Stop lookin' over my shoulder. Sit down!

25:27.901 --> 25:31.496
Not... What are you, stupid?
That's the bedroom. Sit in the den.

25:33.032 --> 25:35.160
The den?

25:36.452 --> 25:40.502
Excuse me. Just where would the den be?

25:41.331 --> 25:43.004
You're in it. Sit.

25:50.340 --> 25:51.466
Good.

25:53.677 --> 25:55.554
Tens! Close enough.

25:56.472 --> 25:57.564
Here we go!

26:01.351 --> 26:02.544
Brown...

26:02.644 --> 26:03.736
What?

26:04.021 --> 26:05.547
Nothing, nothing.

26:05.647 --> 26:07.991
They're fine. They're just fine.

26:08.150 --> 26:09.276
Thank you. Thank you.

26:09.818 --> 26:10.990
Look...

26:11.737 --> 26:13.865
I got work to do. Disappear.

26:18.994 --> 26:20.496
Excuse me.

26:21.455 --> 26:25.234
Would there be a place around here
that I could get something to eat?

26:25.334 --> 26:28.679
Yeah. Going through the garbage
or going to the mission.

26:29.671 --> 26:32.390
Where would I find the mission?

26:33.550 --> 26:35.348
Hey, what do I look like, a tour guide?

26:36.804 --> 26:38.556
I'll find it myself.

26:48.690 --> 26:50.237
You're never gonna find it!

26:50.442 --> 26:52.886
You're goin' in the wrong direction!

26:52.986 --> 26:54.488
He's helpless.

26:54.863 --> 26:57.161
Wait! Let me cover my cans.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.374
I'm goin' there myself. I'll show you.

27:03.038 --> 27:05.541
I saved your life, I saved your feet.

27:06.083 --> 27:08.006
This is your last help.

27:23.142 --> 27:25.895
This means a lot to us. God bless you.

27:35.863 --> 27:37.911
Could I have a little more?

27:38.699 --> 27:40.246
- Just one more.
- Hey!

27:41.535 --> 27:42.878
Thank you.

27:46.456 --> 27:48.208
Hey, Pepto!

27:48.792 --> 27:50.544
Pepto! Pepto!

27:53.005 --> 27:55.199
- Pepto?
- Yeah, that's me.

27:55.299 --> 27:56.617
Hey, come sit with us, huh?

27:56.717 --> 27:57.701
Over here.

27:57.801 --> 28:00.270
Hey, come on.
There are two empty seats over there.

28:01.847 --> 28:03.832
Hey, Pepto. I see you met Molly.

28:03.932 --> 28:04.979
Hi, Molly, how you doin'?

28:06.727 --> 28:10.047
- You two know each other?
- Yeah, we're old pals.

28:10.147 --> 28:12.841
I relieved myself on him
this morning by mistake.

28:12.941 --> 28:15.569
See? Still unused.

28:20.365 --> 28:23.644
Pepto, I'd like you to say hello
to my friend Fumes.

28:23.744 --> 28:24.745
Howdy.

28:25.287 --> 28:26.288
Yeah.

28:35.297 --> 28:38.176
Man, oh, man, stewed stew.

28:39.134 --> 28:41.728
- You get it? Stew.
- I get it.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.642
I'm gonna get some bread.
Anybody want anything?

28:46.892 --> 28:49.361
- Yeah. Get me some whole wheat.
- All right, babe.

28:57.027 --> 28:58.554
Excuse me, I hate to be compulsive,

28:58.654 --> 29:00.514
but you have a little bit of corn
right on your cheek.

29:00.614 --> 29:01.661
Thanks.

29:02.574 --> 29:03.642
Is it gone?

29:03.742 --> 29:06.962
No. You moved it up to your cheekbone.

29:10.624 --> 29:12.001
Is it gone?

29:15.170 --> 29:18.515
It's right in the bridge
of your nose now.

29:21.009 --> 29:22.181
Did I get it?

29:25.389 --> 29:27.016
Yeah. You got it.

29:31.728 --> 29:33.480
Here you go, Molly.

29:35.232 --> 29:36.859
Hey, man.

29:37.651 --> 29:40.200
You got a piece of corn on your face.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.168
Anybody finished here?

29:54.960 --> 29:56.678
- I am.
- Thank you.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.097
Thanks, Pops.

30:00.757 --> 30:02.910
Pops ain't gonna be around long.

30:03.010 --> 30:04.077
His elevens are up.

30:04.177 --> 30:05.178
What?

30:05.721 --> 30:08.019
His elevens.
Look at the back of his neck.

30:09.224 --> 30:10.897
See them two cords stickin' out?

30:11.351 --> 30:13.353
They make like an eleven.

30:14.229 --> 30:17.574
Once they're up, that's it.
He's a goner.

30:18.442 --> 30:19.739
Oh, boy!

30:20.610 --> 30:23.910
Maybe he'll come back
in the world something better.

30:24.072 --> 30:26.166
Personally, when I die,

30:27.242 --> 30:29.586
I'd like to come back as a bird.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.212
Why?

30:31.330 --> 30:35.210
Because, man, I could fly free and easy.

30:35.917 --> 30:41.299
And if I saw someone I really didn't
care for, I'd drop a hot one on 'em.

30:43.258 --> 30:46.262
When I die, I want to be excremated.

30:47.095 --> 30:50.624
And I want my ashes
sprinkled in the old briny.

30:50.724 --> 30:54.274
At least I'd be part of the sea
forever and ever.

30:55.437 --> 30:58.173
That's beautiful, man, beautiful.

30:58.273 --> 31:01.301
Like, when I die,
I want to go just like my daddy. Boom!

31:01.401 --> 31:02.903
Peaceful, in his sleep.

31:03.403 --> 31:05.347
Yeah, they told me my grandmother
died peacefully in her sleep.

31:05.447 --> 31:06.390
It's a good way to go.

31:06.490 --> 31:09.518
Nobody dies peacefully in their sleep!

31:09.618 --> 31:11.586
That's what they tell people
to make 'em feel good.

31:13.288 --> 31:15.757
Do you want to know
how people really die in their sleep?

31:17.584 --> 31:19.837
Okay. First, they go to bed.

31:27.135 --> 31:30.480
Then about 2:00
in the morning, they go...

31:43.735 --> 31:45.829
I'm about to die.

31:54.496 --> 31:56.965
I ain't never goin' to sleep again.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.754
I have to make some money.

32:04.172 --> 32:06.675
How can I make some money down here?

32:06.800 --> 32:08.393
Why don't you do what they all do?

32:08.760 --> 32:09.852
What?

32:10.011 --> 32:11.183
Beg.

32:11.304 --> 32:13.682
Beg. I tried that,

32:14.683 --> 32:17.527
but I'm not really
proficient in that yet.

32:28.864 --> 32:32.038
Bye-bye, children.
I love you. Have a safe trip.

32:34.744 --> 32:37.293
And remember, this is a new start.
No drinkin'.

32:40.917 --> 32:41.964
And no drugs!

32:43.837 --> 32:47.216
And, above all, no infidelity!

32:56.224 --> 32:57.417
Shut up!

32:57.517 --> 32:58.960
I didn't say that much!

32:59.060 --> 33:00.528
Take it easy.

33:01.521 --> 33:04.549
Can you believe
that in the middle of all this filth,

33:04.649 --> 33:07.619
two lost souls could find
some small shred of happiness?

33:08.361 --> 33:09.638
Happiness?

33:09.738 --> 33:11.473
What a crock!

33:11.573 --> 33:13.120
See you after the honeymoon!

33:13.783 --> 33:17.003
Lady! You got a job, you keep it!

33:17.871 --> 33:19.748
Don't make my mistake.

33:21.917 --> 33:23.419
You had a job?

33:23.752 --> 33:25.821
Job?

33:25.921 --> 33:27.093
I had a career.

33:28.632 --> 33:30.179
I was a dancer.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.602
And a good one.

33:33.303 --> 33:36.273
Before I gave it up when I got married!

33:40.602 --> 33:42.462
You were married?

33:42.562 --> 33:45.006
You bet I was married.

33:45.106 --> 33:49.010
I was married to Tom. Tom Terrific.

33:49.110 --> 33:51.533
"Sure, Tom. Anything you want, Tom.

33:51.988 --> 33:55.117
"You want it now, Tom?

33:55.617 --> 33:57.164
"Sure, Tom!

33:57.953 --> 33:59.000
"Go ahead, Tom.

33:59.412 --> 34:00.629
"What?

34:01.289 --> 34:03.166
"Finished already, Tom?

34:04.209 --> 34:06.132
"No, I don't mind, Tom.

34:07.587 --> 34:09.385
"Where you goin', Tom?

34:09.755 --> 34:11.241
"You wash up, Tom!

34:11.341 --> 34:13.469
"I'll finish by myself, Tom!

34:13.802 --> 34:14.893
"Tom...

34:17.138 --> 34:18.481
"Where'd you go, Tom?"

34:21.393 --> 34:23.270
"You didn't leave a note, Tom.

34:24.938 --> 34:26.940
"I'm all alone here, Tom.

34:27.815 --> 34:29.409
"You left me all the bills, Tom.

34:29.734 --> 34:32.283
"They're taking away the house.

34:32.821 --> 34:35.324
"Tom, I don't have a job! Tom?

34:35.782 --> 34:38.501
"I'm in a lot of trouble."

34:44.165 --> 34:47.293
So, after Tom ran out,

34:48.085 --> 34:51.181
I realized I had to adjust
my entire lifestyle.

34:52.591 --> 34:54.013
I created this whole
new mental attitude.

34:54.175 --> 34:55.744
It's called a nervous breakdown.

34:55.844 --> 34:58.848
I cried a lot, I screamed a lot.

34:58.972 --> 35:00.749
I was hysterical morning,
noon, and night.

35:00.849 --> 35:02.522
I was like this...

35:02.976 --> 35:05.070
"Help me! Somebody help me!

35:05.812 --> 35:09.533
"Help me! Help me! Somebody help me!"

35:10.525 --> 35:11.651
Get the picture?

35:12.235 --> 35:14.158
I got it. Yes, I got it.

35:14.279 --> 35:15.872
I think the whole block got it.

35:17.365 --> 35:21.495
So, I've been in this nervous breakdown
for about eight years.

35:22.037 --> 35:23.730
And you know something? I like it.

35:23.830 --> 35:28.485
I walk when I want, I sit down when I want,
I cry when I want, I laugh when I want.

35:28.585 --> 35:30.383
I pick my own hours.

35:31.087 --> 35:32.304
Sounds a little...

35:32.672 --> 35:33.698
Crazy?

35:33.798 --> 35:35.116
There's nothing wrong with crazy.

35:35.216 --> 35:37.719
Crazy's good. Crazy keeps 'em away.

35:40.096 --> 35:41.894
So what's your story?

35:42.557 --> 35:43.854
You ever been married?

35:44.809 --> 35:47.653
Yes. I tried it once. Didn't work out.

35:48.563 --> 35:51.282
She said I spent
all my time making money.

35:53.193 --> 35:55.070
That was time well spent.

36:00.492 --> 36:03.645
Bring it down. Yeah. All over. All over.

36:03.745 --> 36:05.146
It burns up nice.

36:05.246 --> 36:06.648
Yeah. In here, in here.

36:06.748 --> 36:07.774
Watch it! Yeah.

36:07.874 --> 36:09.442
It's going to burn big!

36:09.542 --> 36:11.486
Big stuff here, Victor!

36:11.586 --> 36:13.613
Yeah, get in. That's it, that's it.

36:13.713 --> 36:15.824
I wish I had some marshmallows!

36:15.924 --> 36:16.950
- Light it.
- What?

36:17.050 --> 36:18.535
- Light it!
- Light it. Yeah, right. Light it.

36:18.635 --> 36:21.263
Victor, this is gonna be so good! Yes.

36:22.931 --> 36:23.915
Yeah! Yeah!

36:24.015 --> 36:25.041
- Good.
- Victor, look at it.

36:25.141 --> 36:27.439
- Good.
- Yes, burn, burn! Yes, yes.

36:28.895 --> 36:30.338
Yes! Look at it!

36:30.438 --> 36:32.549
Look at it! I love fire!

36:32.649 --> 36:34.426
Now she won't fool with us no more!

36:34.526 --> 36:37.200
We should go now, Victor.

36:45.662 --> 36:47.585
What was that all about?

36:49.249 --> 36:51.047
Hey, that's my place!

36:53.670 --> 36:56.389
My stuff!

36:59.092 --> 37:01.686
Shall I call the fire department?

37:02.512 --> 37:04.810
Nah! It's just a bunch of junk.

37:19.154 --> 37:21.498
I'm going to get those bastards.

37:24.159 --> 37:25.661
Come over here.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.896
Now, I want you to get
Mean Victor and Yo

37:27.996 --> 37:31.876
and get them to chase you down here
to this Chinese restaurant.

37:32.167 --> 37:33.526
Me?

37:33.626 --> 37:34.903
Yes.

37:35.003 --> 37:39.725
Then I want you to run through this door
and lock it behind you.

37:39.841 --> 37:42.811
Now, if you lock it, you're safe.

37:44.387 --> 37:45.559
We'll do the rest.

37:47.515 --> 37:49.108
Can you do this?

37:49.225 --> 37:51.336
May I propose an alternative?

37:51.436 --> 37:52.528
What?

37:52.729 --> 37:53.821
Why don't we sue?

37:57.609 --> 37:59.987
You may be the weak link in this.

38:04.532 --> 38:06.500
You know what to do
when you get in the kitchen.

38:34.646 --> 38:36.068
"Weak link."

38:41.778 --> 38:45.203
I'm addressing the two degenerates
who call themselves Victor and Yo!

38:45.615 --> 38:48.585
You rob and exploit the helpless
for your own profit and gain

38:48.827 --> 38:52.798
and use the spoils of your activities
to buy and sell illegal narcotics.

38:54.791 --> 38:57.920
Therefore, I am making
a citizen's arrest.

38:59.838 --> 39:02.341
Citizen's arrest.

39:03.132 --> 39:04.349
And you won't be needing this anymore!

39:09.931 --> 39:11.524
Get him!

39:16.187 --> 39:17.922
You have the right to remain silent!

39:18.022 --> 39:22.243
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law!

39:45.758 --> 39:47.101
God damn it!

40:01.900 --> 40:03.117
Thank God!

40:04.777 --> 40:05.824
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

40:05.945 --> 40:07.037
Don't pour!

40:07.322 --> 40:08.848
Wait till they're right under us.

40:08.948 --> 40:11.392
All right. I admit it.
I have a very weak case.

40:11.492 --> 40:13.711
You'll be happy to know
I'm dropping the charges.

40:25.089 --> 40:26.306
Oh, shit!

40:26.799 --> 40:27.925
I'm out of bounds.

40:28.509 --> 40:31.012
- Hey, what's that noise?
- I don't know.

40:33.723 --> 40:34.849
It stopped.

40:43.900 --> 40:46.653
What's he doin'? He's comin' back again?

40:48.488 --> 40:50.786
He's the bravest man I've ever seen.

40:51.407 --> 40:53.518
I'm not mad.
I just want to put my foot up here.

40:53.618 --> 40:55.996
Yeah, that's good. That's good.

40:58.039 --> 40:59.416
Pepto, get out of the way!

41:01.334 --> 41:02.381
Now!

41:10.009 --> 41:11.477
It's hot.

41:22.230 --> 41:23.756
They won't come around here anymore.

41:23.856 --> 41:24.799
I hope so.

41:24.899 --> 41:27.368
Jeez, they really did a job on you.

41:28.069 --> 41:30.447
Man, you throw a mean face.

41:34.117 --> 41:36.978
Well, according to this,
his ankle alarm went off at 3:35

41:37.078 --> 41:38.830
for 28-and-one-half seconds.

41:39.414 --> 41:41.816
Well, let's just say 30 seconds.
Then we'd win.

41:41.916 --> 41:45.170
But his lawyers
get a copy of the same readout, sir.

41:48.089 --> 41:52.185
Anybody know why he stepped
out of bounds for 28-and-a-half seconds?

41:52.552 --> 41:56.831
Well, our surveillance tell us that he was
attacked by some vicious derelicts, sir,

41:56.931 --> 41:58.899
and, I might add, was severely beaten.

41:59.100 --> 42:00.376
He almost...

42:00.476 --> 42:02.023
He almost what?

42:03.021 --> 42:04.113
Died.

42:04.605 --> 42:05.822
My God.

42:07.191 --> 42:08.283
Died?

42:12.739 --> 42:15.618
I don't want to be responsible
for his death.

42:17.452 --> 42:19.375
You think there's any chance
that could happen?

42:20.288 --> 42:22.131
Well, it is possible.

42:22.457 --> 42:23.608
He is living in the streets,

42:23.708 --> 42:27.070
and there's so much danger down there,
you never know what could happen.

42:27.170 --> 42:28.888
We'll keep you posted, Mr. Crasswell.

42:29.172 --> 42:31.174
Yes, yes. Thank you.

42:36.721 --> 42:37.893
Die.

42:38.973 --> 42:41.647
I never thought he could actually die.

42:45.313 --> 42:47.315
That would be so tragic.

42:58.534 --> 43:00.332
There. This'll help.

43:03.039 --> 43:04.148
What is that?

43:04.248 --> 43:06.150
It's some stuff Fumes drinks.

43:06.250 --> 43:08.048
It'll kill anything except Fumes.

43:08.169 --> 43:09.967
He's germ-proof.
Germs wouldn't live in him.

43:10.797 --> 43:13.141
I'm being invaded by one!

43:16.010 --> 43:17.603
Dead germs!

43:19.180 --> 43:20.540
Wait, looks like it's gonna rain.

43:20.640 --> 43:22.041
I don't like rain.

43:22.141 --> 43:24.485
We gonna sleep in this box.
You got a place to sleep?

43:24.602 --> 43:26.855
As a matter of fact, we don't.

43:27.105 --> 43:28.256
Hey, there's some boxes over there.

43:28.356 --> 43:31.030
- Come on, Fumes, let's get 'em one.
- Yeah.

43:34.487 --> 43:36.160
Here's a good one.

43:46.040 --> 43:47.212
Now.

43:47.667 --> 43:50.090
This is my side. This is your side.

43:51.045 --> 43:54.800
And this is a World War II
Army-Navy surplus store bayonet.

43:58.886 --> 44:01.309
This will remind us of our boundaries.
Okay?

44:02.348 --> 44:04.601
I assure you I have no intention

44:05.059 --> 44:09.906
of coming near you or touching you
or in any way violating your person.

44:10.857 --> 44:12.404
Please.

44:13.025 --> 44:17.326
I've heard the same fancy words from
other guys just before they jump you.

44:20.408 --> 44:21.751
Good night.

44:24.287 --> 44:26.540
Look, I don't mean to be harsh.

44:27.123 --> 44:29.251
It's just that you're a man.

44:30.877 --> 44:32.470
Men are no good.

44:39.135 --> 44:40.557
I can do it.

44:40.761 --> 44:42.013
Do what?

44:42.930 --> 44:44.457
Nothing. Nothing.

44:44.557 --> 44:46.434
Good night. Good night.

45:11.042 --> 45:12.510
It's raining.

45:14.337 --> 45:15.964
I love the rain.

45:16.631 --> 45:19.134
Washes all the filth out of the city.

45:20.176 --> 45:24.147
Speaking of filth, where would
Goddard Bolt go on a night like this?

45:25.014 --> 45:29.269
Well, if it were very bad, he'd go to
the mission with the other derelicts.

45:29.685 --> 45:31.629
It's a shame.

45:31.729 --> 45:33.923
It's a rotten shame that these people
have to live like this,

45:34.023 --> 45:36.276
always on the edge of uncertainty.

45:37.860 --> 45:39.908
Any chance of
getting that mission closed tonight?

45:40.738 --> 45:42.490
Very good idea, sir.

45:42.823 --> 45:43.824
Thank you.

45:47.954 --> 45:49.922
It's coming down harder.

46:15.898 --> 46:17.866
What the heck's going on?

46:20.194 --> 46:23.368
We're getting flooded out.
Come on, let's go.

46:35.084 --> 46:36.802
Oh, man!

46:38.337 --> 46:40.114
Look out, Sailor!

46:40.214 --> 46:42.366
For there goes the neighborhood!

46:42.466 --> 46:43.558
This is bad!

46:45.386 --> 46:48.164
The rain always kicks up my cough.

46:48.264 --> 46:50.249
We'd better get to the mission.

46:50.349 --> 46:52.693
Yeah. Look out!

47:14.290 --> 47:15.691
Open the door!

47:15.791 --> 47:18.402
Open up in there. We gettin' wet!

47:18.502 --> 47:20.049
It's locked. It's locked.

47:22.923 --> 47:24.283
It's locked.

47:24.383 --> 47:27.227
Why would they lock the mission
on a night like this?

48:00.211 --> 48:02.863
- Hey, Fumes? Fumes?
- Yeah?

48:02.963 --> 48:05.762
Fumes, I really feel lousy.

48:06.342 --> 48:08.536
Tell me the truth. Take a look.

48:08.636 --> 48:09.870
Are my elevens up?

48:09.970 --> 48:12.790
No, man, no.
God damn it. Let me go to sleep.

48:12.890 --> 48:14.750
That's good. That's good.

48:14.850 --> 48:17.837
I'm gonna go down to the clinic.

48:17.937 --> 48:20.172
Maybe they can give me something.

48:20.272 --> 48:21.899
See you. See you.

48:44.672 --> 48:46.049
Hey, Sailor?

48:50.136 --> 48:51.353
Sailor?

48:53.764 --> 48:54.981
Sailor?

48:58.727 --> 48:59.944
Sailor?

49:07.194 --> 49:10.619
Hey, y'all. Hey, hey. Wake up. Wake up.

49:11.532 --> 49:13.059
- Have you seen Sailor?
- No.

49:13.159 --> 49:15.853
Man, he looked like shit last night.

49:15.953 --> 49:18.297
Maybe I ought to go look for him.

49:19.290 --> 49:21.793
Yeah, okay.
Look, we'll all go look for him.

49:22.585 --> 49:25.555
You go up there. And go down there.

49:26.338 --> 49:28.306
- Go there?
- Yeah, yeah. Go on.

49:29.425 --> 49:30.642
Sailor?

49:31.302 --> 49:32.519
Sailor?

49:49.778 --> 49:51.121
Sailor?

49:54.742 --> 49:55.959
Sailor?

49:56.327 --> 49:59.581
The guy is dead. He's blockin' my place.

50:00.915 --> 50:02.337
You know him, get him outta here.

50:05.252 --> 50:08.322
All right. Okay.
The show is over. All right?

50:08.422 --> 50:10.424
Come on. You're blocking the place here.

50:10.591 --> 50:12.993
What's the matter?
You never seen a stiff before?

50:13.093 --> 50:14.766
Come on, beat it. All right?

50:17.223 --> 50:18.645
Come on.

50:25.606 --> 50:26.882
What do you got?

50:26.982 --> 50:29.969
He's gone. He's been dead a long time.
We better call the coroner.

50:30.069 --> 50:34.290
No, there's too many DOA's already.
Let's just take him to the morgue.

51:16.490 --> 51:18.017
You call this an ocean?

51:18.117 --> 51:21.212
Sooner or later it all goes
to the ocean.

51:23.372 --> 51:25.191
Why are we doing this?

51:25.291 --> 51:29.320
We're doing this because Sailor wanted
his ashes sprinkled in the ol' briny.

51:29.420 --> 51:31.343
He's so light!

51:32.965 --> 51:34.200
How much did he weigh?

51:34.300 --> 51:36.911
130, maybe 140 pounds.

51:37.011 --> 51:39.079
Must've been mostly moisture.

51:39.179 --> 51:41.432
Is that the best you could do?
A shoe box?

51:41.974 --> 51:43.125
We're lucky to get it.

51:43.225 --> 51:46.086
Let's face it,
they put the rich in an urn,

51:46.186 --> 51:49.656
and they put the poor
in a cardboard box like take-out.

51:53.861 --> 51:55.613
Well, go ahead.

51:58.949 --> 52:02.203
Man, here! You do it. You talk the best.

52:06.624 --> 52:09.878
Sailor, wherever you are...

52:11.462 --> 52:12.964
He's in there.

52:13.797 --> 52:15.219
I know.

52:15.966 --> 52:19.203
Sailor, you were a little man

52:19.303 --> 52:24.124
often covered with dirt and filth
and the last thing that you ate.

52:24.224 --> 52:27.628
But your heart was always
good and clean.

52:27.728 --> 52:32.199
And I hope you get your final wish
and your ashes make it out to sea.

52:37.946 --> 52:39.289
Good luck.

52:44.662 --> 52:45.771
So long, Sailor.

52:45.871 --> 52:47.147
Bye, Sailor.

52:47.247 --> 52:48.649
All the best.

52:48.749 --> 52:49.817
- Bye, Sailor.
- Bye-bye, Sailor.

52:49.917 --> 52:50.901
God bless you, Sailor.

52:51.001 --> 52:52.820
Rest in peace, Sailor.

52:52.920 --> 52:56.220
- Good-bye, Sailor.
- Good-bye, Sailor.

53:03.013 --> 53:04.481
Goodbye, Sailor.

53:08.936 --> 53:10.279
Excuse me.

53:10.771 --> 53:12.773
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting?

53:13.607 --> 53:14.883
I'm interrupting, aren't I?

53:14.983 --> 53:18.721
Yeah. I should go.
I should go because this is wrong.

53:18.821 --> 53:20.347
It's stupid. It's wrong.

53:20.447 --> 53:24.702
It's morally and ethically wrong
for me to even be here. Isn't it?

53:25.285 --> 53:29.189
Because we all know that your client
only has two days to go to win the bet.

53:29.289 --> 53:31.025
It looks like he's going to win it,
and therefore,

53:31.125 --> 53:33.674
I have no business
even being here. Do I?

53:36.797 --> 53:39.408
I'm just going
to put it simply, gentlemen.

53:39.508 --> 53:41.306
Would you consider

53:41.969 --> 53:48.250
betraying the man for whom you've
worked 10 years in exchange for...

53:48.350 --> 53:50.899
How do you say this?

53:52.604 --> 53:55.027
...just a shitload of money?

54:09.997 --> 54:11.499
I made it.

54:12.249 --> 54:14.923
I can't believe it. I made it.

54:15.836 --> 54:17.554
My last day.

54:18.589 --> 54:20.182
No more filthy clothes.

54:21.133 --> 54:23.160
No more eating garbage.

54:23.260 --> 54:25.479
No more sleeping in the cold.

54:25.721 --> 54:28.019
Thank you. Thank you, God.

54:31.477 --> 54:33.980
I'm sorry I didn't believe in you
when I was rich.

54:35.898 --> 54:38.492
I did it! I did it!

54:39.902 --> 54:43.031
Where'd he do it?
Not around here, I hope.

54:45.449 --> 54:47.226
Molly, Molly, Molly!

54:47.326 --> 54:49.603
Champagne! Champagne! I stole it!

54:49.703 --> 54:50.896
- What?
- It's okay.

54:50.996 --> 54:53.232
I left an IOU for $1000.

54:53.332 --> 54:54.709
Here, here.

54:56.376 --> 54:57.778
Help me celebrate.

54:57.878 --> 54:59.279
Celebrate what?

54:59.379 --> 55:01.073
I won the bet.

55:01.173 --> 55:02.199
What bet?

55:02.299 --> 55:03.951
The bet, the bet.

55:04.051 --> 55:05.411
When you find out about it,

55:05.511 --> 55:08.205
it's gonna make you
the happiest person in the world!

55:08.305 --> 55:10.457
Here! Here's to happy.

55:10.557 --> 55:12.668
No, no. I don't like happy.

55:12.768 --> 55:15.692
Happy's no good. Happy doesn't last.

55:16.021 --> 55:17.548
I like depressed.

55:17.648 --> 55:20.050
Depressed stays with you for a while.

55:20.150 --> 55:23.450
Okay. Here's to depressed.

55:24.905 --> 55:26.907
Okay. I'll drink to that.

55:31.495 --> 55:33.338
This is good!

55:36.416 --> 55:39.153
It's raining. Come on, let's get inside.

55:39.253 --> 55:41.221
Go inside, go in that door.

55:42.756 --> 55:45.430
Watch your step. I gotta dump my stuff.

55:50.722 --> 55:52.941
Careful. Let me get the lights.

55:59.773 --> 56:01.550
Good! It's empty.

56:01.650 --> 56:03.302
- Here.
- Hey!

56:03.402 --> 56:05.220
What are you trying to do, get me drunk?

56:05.320 --> 56:08.182
Yeah, how am I doin'?

56:08.282 --> 56:09.829
Doing good.

56:12.995 --> 56:15.999
I love that song.
That's my favorite song!

56:23.255 --> 56:25.365
- Dance with me! Come on!
- No!

56:25.465 --> 56:26.950
Come on! You said you were a dancer.

56:27.050 --> 56:30.179
I don't dance. That was a long time ago.

56:31.013 --> 56:33.040
This is the greatest night of my life.

56:33.140 --> 56:35.626
Help me celebrate. I won the bet!

56:35.726 --> 56:37.649
The bet! The bet!

56:43.483 --> 56:44.735
Please.

56:50.157 --> 56:51.892
Okay. All right. All right.

56:51.992 --> 56:53.539
Let me lighten up.

59:35.947 --> 59:37.415
Yes.

59:38.950 --> 59:41.373
Yes! Please!

59:41.745 --> 59:43.338
Please!

59:44.998 --> 59:48.093
- Hurry. Hurry.
- I am.

59:49.336 --> 59:51.780
I want you! I want you!

59:51.880 --> 59:53.132
Where are you?

59:55.092 --> 59:56.618
Yes, yes.

59:56.718 --> 59:58.036
Faster! Faster!

59:58.136 --> 01:00:00.764
- I'm goin' as fast as I can!
- Okay.

01:00:05.185 --> 01:00:06.812
You're beautiful.

01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:12.884
My God. Two buses to get here.
Used up all my change.

01:00:12.984 --> 01:00:15.012
This is crazy. We're gonna get busted!

01:00:15.112 --> 01:00:17.889
Don't worry. Everything is all right.

01:00:17.989 --> 01:00:19.474
That's my house.

01:00:19.574 --> 01:00:21.309
Everything in it is mine.

01:00:21.409 --> 01:00:23.437
You hear that music?
You hear that laughter?

01:00:23.537 --> 01:00:25.230
It's a celebration in my honor.

01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:28.525
- I won the bet!
- Again with this bet!

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:33.280
Listen, just come in with me,
and everything will be wonderfully clear.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:34.614
Come on.

01:00:34.714 --> 01:00:36.783
All right. Look, I'm gonna go with you,

01:00:36.883 --> 01:00:39.978
but if anything happens, we're gonna
grab what we can and run for our lives.

01:00:44.141 --> 01:00:47.169
Run for our lives. Come on.

01:00:47.269 --> 01:00:49.146
You are something.

01:00:51.064 --> 01:00:52.340
Wait'll you see it. Wait'll you see it.

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:54.989
Don't worry. This is my house!

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:58.743
Here it is. Home.

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:07.064
- Come on.
- No! Pepto, no.

01:01:07.164 --> 01:01:08.165
Come on!

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:19.430
Well, I did it.

01:01:22.429 --> 01:01:24.102
Goddard?

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:29.110
Oh, my God, it's such
a relief to see you.

01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:32.948
What happened to you?
You look like a vagrant.

01:01:33.773 --> 01:01:37.243
Of course I look like a vagrant!
That was our bet.

01:01:37.986 --> 01:01:39.558
Bet...

01:01:40.197 --> 01:01:42.190
Bet, bet, bet.

01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:45.777
- What bet?
- What bet?

01:01:46.411 --> 01:01:48.379
Anybody here
know what he's talking about?

01:01:50.916 --> 01:01:53.635
Does anybody
know anything about this bet?

01:01:55.295 --> 01:01:56.592
You.

01:01:56.963 --> 01:01:59.825
Pritchard, Knowles, Stevens.

01:01:59.925 --> 01:02:01.142
What the hell's going on?

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.854
Show him the contract. Show him the bet!

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:06.477
What?

01:02:07.307 --> 01:02:08.479
What's going on here?

01:02:10.185 --> 01:02:12.483
Why are you letting this happen?

01:02:16.483 --> 01:02:19.407
You're all in on it.
You're all in on it.

01:02:21.446 --> 01:02:23.039
Ten years.

01:02:23.323 --> 01:02:25.542
You've been with me 10 years.

01:02:26.493 --> 01:02:28.120
How could you turn on me?

01:02:28.495 --> 01:02:32.045
Where's your sense of
loyalty, honesty, decency?

01:02:32.624 --> 01:02:34.843
Mr. Bolt, we're lawyers.

01:02:41.466 --> 01:02:44.619
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
This is still my house!

01:02:44.719 --> 01:02:47.164
I want everybody out.
Do you hear me? Out!

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:50.017
Yeah! Yeah, you heard him.
Get outta here!

01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:53.737
Please, stay where you are.

01:02:54.396 --> 01:02:55.739
Thank you.

01:02:56.523 --> 01:02:59.009
I'm sorry. You got it all wrong.

01:02:59.109 --> 01:03:00.656
This isn't your house anymore.

01:03:01.444 --> 01:03:04.698
I'm afraid you've been declared
non compos mentis.

01:03:04.948 --> 01:03:07.601
You see,

01:03:07.701 --> 01:03:11.563
when you lost your mind,
you lost everything.

01:03:11.663 --> 01:03:15.025
When you gave us power of attorney,
we did what was best.

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:16.422
For everyone.

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:19.884
I bought this house at a public auction.
I just...

01:03:20.255 --> 01:03:24.055
I couldn't stand
the thought of strangers living here.

01:03:27.595 --> 01:03:31.065
I've been living in garbage.

01:03:32.142 --> 01:03:33.485
With rats!

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:36.400
For a month!

01:03:36.896 --> 01:03:39.524
And now, I have nothing?

01:03:41.192 --> 01:03:43.011
Nothing?

01:03:43.111 --> 01:03:44.738
Not even my house?

01:03:55.248 --> 01:03:56.942
Well, you're not getting these!

01:03:57.042 --> 01:03:59.986
No, no. They're by Cellini.

01:04:00.086 --> 01:04:02.906
I bought them.
I bought them from the Vatican.

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:04.758
I got a good price.

01:04:05.633 --> 01:04:07.055
My Van Gogh!

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:16.774
Come on, Dr. Gachet, we're leaving.

01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:20.274
My wine!

01:04:26.446 --> 01:04:27.993
ChÃ¢teau Lafite!

01:04:32.994 --> 01:04:34.120
Rodin!

01:04:40.043 --> 01:04:41.841
My tapestry!

01:04:42.087 --> 01:04:45.466
I'm not leaving without my
Rape of the Sabine Women.

01:04:47.175 --> 01:04:49.202
All right. Goddard, stop, please.

01:04:49.302 --> 01:04:50.704
Stop. This is pathetic.

01:04:50.804 --> 01:04:52.038
Get out of my way!

01:04:52.138 --> 01:04:53.481
Fine, fine.

01:04:58.019 --> 01:05:00.863
Yeah! And we'll be back
for the rest later!

01:05:01.606 --> 01:05:04.109
Let go of me!

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:09.122
- Van Gogh! My Van Gogh!
- Let go of me!

01:05:15.412 --> 01:05:17.689
This is pathetic, isn't it?

01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:18.881
Very.

01:05:23.503 --> 01:05:24.675
Pepto!

01:05:26.798 --> 01:05:28.015
Pepto!

01:05:28.133 --> 01:05:30.511
I'm not Pepto!

01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:41.588
First thing I gotta do
is make a list of everything I had.

01:05:41.688 --> 01:05:45.693
Cash, stocks, bonds, investments,

01:05:46.359 --> 01:05:48.828
real estate, foreign holdings.

01:05:51.239 --> 01:05:54.309
I can get it back. I can get it all back!
I gotta make some calls.

01:05:54.409 --> 01:05:55.894
I have to reestablish my line of credit.

01:05:55.994 --> 01:05:57.812
That's all I have to do.
They'll take my calls.

01:05:57.912 --> 01:06:00.607
Why shouldn't they take my calls?
I've got a...

01:06:00.707 --> 01:06:02.525
I was the richest man in the world.

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:04.194
The richest! The richest!

01:06:04.294 --> 01:06:06.821
Shut up! Shut up!

01:06:06.921 --> 01:06:09.032
- Who are you?
- I'm J. Paul Getty.

01:06:09.132 --> 01:06:10.617
I was the richest man in the world!

01:06:10.717 --> 01:06:13.119
You don't see me
ranting and raving about it, do you?

01:06:13.219 --> 01:06:15.372
No! I took my losses!

01:06:15.472 --> 01:06:16.539
What losses?

01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:18.937
During the crash, the clash, the smash!

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.546
Listen to me. You're not J. Paul Getty.

01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:28.009
You're a pathetic,
broken-minded little bum.

01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:30.720
In your mind, you think you're
J. Paul Getty, but you're not.

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:37.078
Whilst, I, on the other hand,
am Goddard Bolt, a genuine financial giant.

01:06:37.494 --> 01:06:39.312
- So am I!
- You're not!

01:06:39.412 --> 01:06:41.731
- I am!
- You're not!

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:43.208
- I am!
- Wait.

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:45.151
- Come with me.
- Where we going?

01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:46.753
Over here. Let's talk.

01:06:48.046 --> 01:06:51.074
- Now, look, let's be reasonable.
- Okay.

01:06:51.174 --> 01:06:53.493
There's an enormous
difference between us.

01:06:53.593 --> 01:06:57.497
Even though in your twisted mind
you think you're rich, you're really not.

01:06:57.597 --> 01:07:02.502
On the other hand, because of my serious
understanding of the world of finance,

01:07:02.602 --> 01:07:06.840
I have amassed $6.4 billion!

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.863
And I've amassed 6.5.

01:07:09.234 --> 01:07:10.999
- You didn't.
- I did.

01:07:11.099 --> 01:07:13.138
- You didn't.
- I did.

01:07:15.949 --> 01:07:17.121
Wait!

01:07:20.912 --> 01:07:22.289
Look.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.525
Wait a minute.
Let me show you something.

01:07:25.625 --> 01:07:26.842
- What?
- This.

01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:34.909
Look, I don't want to hurt you.

01:07:35.009 --> 01:07:37.036
- You don't?
- No.

01:07:37.136 --> 01:07:41.666
It's just that it's important to me
that you understand.

01:07:41.766 --> 01:07:44.043
I guess it doesn't make any difference
who's richer, does it?

01:07:44.143 --> 01:07:45.645
No.

01:07:46.104 --> 01:07:47.881
Well, forget about it.

01:07:47.981 --> 01:07:49.608
Oh, God, thanks.

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:52.243
'Cause I'm really richer.

01:08:03.705 --> 01:08:06.834
What's the matter with you?
You're gonna kill this man!

01:08:08.042 --> 01:08:09.944
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

01:08:10.044 --> 01:08:12.906
It was a temporary loss of sanity.

01:08:13.006 --> 01:08:15.617
I'm fine now. Please forgive me.

01:08:15.717 --> 01:08:17.660
I don't know why I did that.
I'm so sorry.

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.203
Please, I meant no harm.

01:08:19.304 --> 01:08:21.648
It was just... Let me apologize.

01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:23.353
I apologize.

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:25.810
Sorry, sorry. Good day.

01:08:26.352 --> 01:08:28.379
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:32.050
But whatever you do,
don't ever argue money with that man.

01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:33.426
Why did he attack you?

01:08:33.526 --> 01:08:34.886
I don't know.

01:08:34.986 --> 01:08:37.535
Maybe it's because I'm richer!

01:08:46.205 --> 01:08:47.627
I don't want to hurt you!

01:08:50.251 --> 01:08:52.549
I'll kill him! I'll get him!
I'll kill him!

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:55.448
You okay?

01:08:55.548 --> 01:08:57.515
I'm okay now that he's gone.

01:09:00.011 --> 01:09:01.103
He's coming back!

01:09:17.944 --> 01:09:20.868
I'm richer! I'm richer! I'm richer!

01:09:23.408 --> 01:09:25.082
That man is crazy!

01:09:25.536 --> 01:09:27.647
Why do you allow these people
to walk the streets?

01:09:27.747 --> 01:09:29.545
They ought to help these people!

01:09:37.381 --> 01:09:39.783
I just made a bet.

01:09:39.884 --> 01:09:41.807
We were just betting. Just a little bet.

01:09:43.095 --> 01:09:47.397
Just cause you make a bet doesn't mean
you have to lose all your money!

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:51.062
I can get it all back.

01:09:52.104 --> 01:09:53.982
I was a financial genius.

01:09:54.273 --> 01:09:59.621
One and one is two, two and two is four,
four and four is three. I still got it!

01:10:00.988 --> 01:10:03.161
Wait! Everybody's wearing white.

01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:05.685
I must be at a wedding.

01:10:05.785 --> 01:10:06.769
We're at a wedding.

01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:10.356
We didn't bring anything!
We have to bring something.

01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:13.130
My car was white.
I had a white Rolls Royce.

01:10:14.001 --> 01:10:15.719
Pull over. Let's get something to eat.

01:10:17.338 --> 01:10:18.840
Capacity!

01:10:19.632 --> 01:10:22.118
What do you mean capacity?
I've got to get this man into Emergency.

01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:26.223
This ward is full.
We have reached capacity!

01:10:27.515 --> 01:10:30.084
Oh, my God, we've reached capacity.

01:10:30.184 --> 01:10:32.357
Sell, sell me out.
Get me out of the market.

01:10:32.645 --> 01:10:34.797
- Dump my pork bellies!
- Put him over here.

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:36.991
It's all going bad. It's no good.

01:10:38.985 --> 01:10:40.828
I don't have my money!

01:10:41.529 --> 01:10:43.531
I don't want to live without my money!

01:10:43.865 --> 01:10:45.663
I don't want to live!

01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:48.620
Life stinks.

01:10:49.495 --> 01:10:51.338
Life stinks.

01:10:51.956 --> 01:10:53.775
Yeah, he's right.

01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:56.173
Life stinks!

01:10:59.046 --> 01:11:00.531
Life stinks.

01:11:00.631 --> 01:11:01.949
What is going on here?

01:11:02.049 --> 01:11:03.642
Life stinks!

01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:06.454
Give this man 500 milligrams
of thorazine immediately!

01:11:06.554 --> 01:11:08.081
- Five hundred?
- Yes. He needs it!

01:11:08.181 --> 01:11:10.525
- Yes, Doctor.
- Life stinks.

01:11:12.018 --> 01:11:13.645
Life stinks.

01:11:14.312 --> 01:11:15.689
Life stinks.

01:11:16.731 --> 01:11:18.358
Life stinks.

01:11:23.696 --> 01:11:25.494
Life stinks.

01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:27.663
Life stinks.

01:11:28.534 --> 01:11:30.207
Life stinks.

01:11:31.078 --> 01:11:32.876
Life stinks.

01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:41.597
Hey! That's my wheelchair.

01:11:42.799 --> 01:11:43.908
I need this for my patient.

01:11:44.008 --> 01:11:47.228
Yo, buddy,
help me get this guy out of this chair.

01:12:06.364 --> 01:12:08.662
- Doc.
- Yes?

01:12:10.409 --> 01:12:12.812
This man is delirious.
Give him 500 milligrams of thorazine.

01:12:12.912 --> 01:12:14.789
- Five hundred?
- Needs it.

01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:18.881
No. No. No. No.

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:29.162
Dr. Kahahn, this man has the DT's.

01:12:29.262 --> 01:12:30.605
He'll be fine, he'll be fine.

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:33.666
But just in case,
give him 500 milligrams of thorazine.

01:12:33.766 --> 01:12:35.293
- Five hundred, Doctor?
- He needs it.

01:12:35.393 --> 01:12:36.394
Yes, Doctor.

01:12:41.774 --> 01:12:44.744
Well, here's a new one.
What do we have here?

01:12:45.945 --> 01:12:48.848
Have I given this patient
any penicillin or antibiotics?

01:12:48.948 --> 01:12:51.976
- No, Doctor.
- Then give him 500 milligrams of thorazine.

01:12:52.076 --> 01:12:54.604
- Five hundred?
- Yes. I'm a doctor. I know what I'm doing.

01:12:54.704 --> 01:12:56.522
- Dr. Kahahn!
- I'm coming!

01:12:56.622 --> 01:12:58.441
Am I the only doctor in this hospital?

01:12:58.541 --> 01:13:01.465
Dr. Kahahn, funeral chapel, line 314.

01:13:19.437 --> 01:13:23.567
Dr. Kahahn! This patient is cyanotic.
He's turning blue!

01:13:24.108 --> 01:13:26.052
This man's been overmedicated!

01:13:26.152 --> 01:13:27.428
Take him to ICU immediately.

01:13:27.528 --> 01:13:30.031
Yes, Doctor. Give me a hand, please.

01:13:31.991 --> 01:13:33.914
How does a thing like this happen?

01:14:00.561 --> 01:14:02.108
Pepto.

01:14:03.522 --> 01:14:05.650
I know you want to give up.

01:14:06.859 --> 01:14:08.486
But you're wrong.

01:14:09.862 --> 01:14:13.537
Even without money, life is good.

01:14:17.203 --> 01:14:18.455
No?

01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:23.171
What about when
you didn't eat for two days,

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:27.426
and then you had
your first big meal at the mission?

01:14:28.005 --> 01:14:29.257
Wasn't that good?

01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:39.067
Remember the other night
when we drank champagne

01:14:40.643 --> 01:14:42.361
and danced?

01:14:43.396 --> 01:14:44.989
And rolled around in the rags?

01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:51.738
I know they're only moments.

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:55.992
But that's all life is.

01:14:57.493 --> 01:14:59.461
Just a bunch of moments.

01:15:01.288 --> 01:15:03.211
Most of them are lousy.

01:15:04.375 --> 01:15:06.924
But once in a while,
you steal a good one.

01:15:20.725 --> 01:15:21.942
Come on.

01:15:23.811 --> 01:15:25.563
Come on back to me.

01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:30.777
Don't be such a selfish bastard.

01:15:33.279 --> 01:15:35.998
You're the only person I can stand.

01:15:40.161 --> 01:15:41.708
Don't leave me.

01:15:45.624 --> 01:15:47.001
I love you.

01:15:48.127 --> 01:15:50.926
Please don't leave me.

01:16:06.812 --> 01:16:07.813
Molly.

01:16:11.942 --> 01:16:13.034
You're crying.

01:16:15.154 --> 01:16:16.656
What happened?

01:16:18.491 --> 01:16:19.959
Somebody die?

01:16:21.744 --> 01:16:22.916
No.

01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:26.173
Somebody lived.

01:16:35.007 --> 01:16:39.683
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the greatest day of my life.

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.791
This is the moment I dreamed of
ever since I grew up

01:16:43.891 --> 01:16:48.567
on these poverty-ridden streets,
as a poor, hungry child.

01:16:51.273 --> 01:16:52.775
I'm all right.

01:16:56.654 --> 01:16:58.656
Where else but in America

01:16:59.406 --> 01:17:03.144
could a poor, deprived boy
from this very same neighborhood

01:17:03.244 --> 01:17:06.339
return one day to destroy it?

01:17:13.212 --> 01:17:15.865
It's good to be alive!

01:17:15.965 --> 01:17:19.469
There's so many things
you can't do when you're dead.

01:17:21.011 --> 01:17:22.684
Remember what you said?

01:17:24.098 --> 01:17:25.249
What?

01:17:25.349 --> 01:17:26.942
What you said in the hospital.

01:17:28.727 --> 01:17:30.354
What?

01:17:31.772 --> 01:17:33.399
That you love me.

01:17:37.695 --> 01:17:40.139
It's words. Just words!

01:17:40.239 --> 01:17:42.583
Love is just another word.

01:17:43.409 --> 01:17:44.911
You meant it.

01:17:47.705 --> 01:17:49.707
Let the demolition begin.

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.093
- Nunzio!
- Yo!

01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:05.831
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
to celebrate and cut the dust,

01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:09.231
I salute you with
the finest champagne money can buy.

01:18:24.783 --> 01:18:26.205
What's that?

01:18:27.661 --> 01:18:28.708
Hey!

01:18:35.461 --> 01:18:37.822
Oh, man! You should see them over there!

01:18:37.922 --> 01:18:42.076
The big shots are having a party in
our neighborhood, and we ain't invited!

01:18:42.176 --> 01:18:43.828
I feel slighted.

01:18:43.928 --> 01:18:46.372
They've got
all types of food and champagne.

01:18:46.472 --> 01:18:48.707
It's so big, they're putting it on TV.

01:18:48.807 --> 01:18:50.543
Come on, Pepto. Hurry up.

01:18:50.643 --> 01:18:54.088
We gotta find a new place
before the good ones are taken.

01:18:54.188 --> 01:18:56.361
No! No more running!

01:18:57.191 --> 01:18:58.884
They forced me to live in the crap!

01:18:58.984 --> 01:19:01.554
And now they want to take the crap away!

01:19:01.654 --> 01:19:02.721
No!

01:19:02.821 --> 01:19:04.431
What do you mean "no"?

01:19:04.531 --> 01:19:06.283
Here's what I mean.

01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:12.956
Stop!

01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:18.070
Wait! Stop! Don't go!

01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:21.157
Don't give up! This is America!

01:19:21.257 --> 01:19:24.535
Every person has a right
to have a place to live!

01:19:24.635 --> 01:19:27.997
Come, join me!
Let's fight for our rights!

01:19:28.097 --> 01:19:31.692
Let's take our homes back! Follow me!

01:19:41.068 --> 01:19:46.015
Wait! There's a party back there!
Free food for everyone!

01:19:46.115 --> 01:19:47.391
And booze!

01:19:47.491 --> 01:19:50.102
Stop, wait, listen to me!

01:19:50.202 --> 01:19:52.000
Wait! Stop!

01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:55.708
If we run now, we'll always be running.

01:19:56.375 --> 01:19:58.377
It's gotta stop somewhere!

01:19:59.670 --> 01:20:01.947
They've got TV news cameras down there.

01:20:02.047 --> 01:20:04.425
Let's show the world
what they're doing to us!

01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:06.223
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:08.762
Come on!

01:20:46.175 --> 01:20:48.428
- We have the nicest neighborhood here.
- Shall we dance?

01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:52.831
Do you come here often?

01:20:52.931 --> 01:20:54.148
Oh, my God!

01:20:55.768 --> 01:20:58.170
I've never seen anything
like this before...

01:20:58.270 --> 01:20:59.988
Hey! Just a minute!

01:21:02.024 --> 01:21:04.510
- How dare you break in like this?
- How dare you break in like this?

01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:07.179
- Who do you people think you are?
- Who do you people think you are?

01:21:07.279 --> 01:21:08.681
- Get out of here!
- Get out of here!

01:21:08.781 --> 01:21:10.599
- I'm talking to you!
- I'm talking to you!

01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:12.268
- Turn around, you idiot!
- Turn around, you idiot!

01:21:12.368 --> 01:21:13.477
- Do you hear me?
- Do you hear me?

01:21:13.577 --> 01:21:14.937
- Are you crazy?
- Are you crazy?

01:21:15.037 --> 01:21:16.563
- Do you know who I am?
- Do you know who I am?

01:21:16.663 --> 01:21:19.191
Do you have any idea
who you are dealing with?

01:21:19.291 --> 01:21:21.402
You are in serious trouble,
my indigent friend!

01:21:21.502 --> 01:21:23.445
You are trespassing on private property!

01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:27.700
I can throw you in jail, have you arrested,
and you will lose your voting privileges!

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:29.643
Have you ever been in jail?

01:21:32.596 --> 01:21:34.498
Chicken!

01:21:34.598 --> 01:21:36.271
How dare you?

01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:47.327
Oh, boy!

01:22:01.125 --> 01:22:05.237
When my husband divorced me,
I thought my life was over.

01:22:05.337 --> 01:22:07.135
It's just beginning.

01:22:21.061 --> 01:22:22.938
Hey, Willy, listen.

01:22:26.024 --> 01:22:27.526
Got you.

01:22:28.569 --> 01:22:30.929
The ceremony
has erupted into pandemonium.

01:22:31.029 --> 01:22:33.766
As of yet,
I'm not exactly sure what's happening.

01:22:33.866 --> 01:22:37.269
This is Fumes reporting from Downtown,
and I'll tell you what's happening.

01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:39.688
The rich and famous
are having a party in our neighborhood.

01:22:39.788 --> 01:22:43.233
And we fucked it up!
Back to you, Walter.

01:22:43.333 --> 01:22:45.903
Is this going out live? Are we live?

01:22:46.003 --> 01:22:47.004
Jeez.

01:22:52.384 --> 01:22:54.453
My legs! You've cut off my legs!

01:22:54.553 --> 01:22:55.770
Oh, my God!

01:22:57.556 --> 01:22:59.650
Oh, my God, look what I've done!

01:23:02.227 --> 01:23:04.525
Get me a doctor! Get me an ambulance!

01:23:09.902 --> 01:23:12.846
Look what you've done!
You cut off my legs!

01:23:12.946 --> 01:23:16.166
- Stay right here, I'll be right back!
- Wait a minute!

01:23:21.747 --> 01:23:23.816
This party has disintegrated
into utter chaos!

01:23:23.916 --> 01:23:26.669
There are bums eating pÃ¢tÃ© de foie gras!

01:23:31.465 --> 01:23:33.217
My God! That's gotta be Bolt!

01:23:37.262 --> 01:23:40.999
He's not the only one who can run
one of those goddamn machines!

01:23:41.099 --> 01:23:42.100
No comment.

01:24:22.808 --> 01:24:24.151
No! No!

01:24:48.458 --> 01:24:49.550
Look!

01:25:07.644 --> 01:25:10.443
No! No! No!

01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:12.782
No!

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:15.698
We had a bet! Remember?

01:25:16.528 --> 01:25:17.529
No.

01:25:17.863 --> 01:25:20.707
Maybe this'll jar your memory!

01:25:25.037 --> 01:25:26.271
Dark! Dark!

01:25:26.371 --> 01:25:28.023
Yes, my memory is dark!

01:25:28.123 --> 01:25:31.377
Yes, I can remember.
It's all coming back to me now.

01:25:32.044 --> 01:25:33.591
You won the bet!

01:25:37.674 --> 01:25:39.201
It's all coming back to me.

01:25:39.301 --> 01:25:42.454
You won the bet,
and I lost the bet, and...

01:25:42.554 --> 01:25:44.456
This is all yours
because I don't want this.

01:25:44.556 --> 01:25:46.809
I don't want it.
I'll be fine when I get down.

01:25:47.267 --> 01:25:50.671
I'll be a gentleman. Just let me down.

01:25:50.771 --> 01:25:52.631
That was two weeks ago.

01:25:52.731 --> 01:25:54.633
Today, in an extraordinary decision,

01:25:54.733 --> 01:25:58.804
Judge Reynolds ruled from the bench
in the Bolt v. Crasswell lawsuit.

01:25:58.904 --> 01:26:02.558
And it was a day
of total victory for Goddard Bolt.

01:26:02.658 --> 01:26:06.853
Bolt has announced he intends to
clean up the slum area he now owns

01:26:06.953 --> 01:26:09.982
and allow it to remain
for the homeless who live there.

01:26:10.082 --> 01:26:13.610
He plans to build a large park,
no-cost housing,

01:26:13.710 --> 01:26:18.574
and a new free medical and counseling
clinic for the destitute of the area.

01:26:18.674 --> 01:26:21.577
And believe it or not,
at this very moment,

01:26:21.677 --> 01:26:23.704
Goddard Bolt is actually marrying

01:26:23.804 --> 01:26:26.832
the bag lady he met
while living on the streets.

01:26:26.932 --> 01:26:29.710
We don't know
where the wedding is taking place,

01:26:29.810 --> 01:26:32.754
but with Goddard Bolt's
reputation for extravagance,

01:26:32.854 --> 01:26:36.950
it must be at a very chic, elegant,
and exclusive location.

01:26:52.290 --> 01:26:54.463
Too fast, you jackass!

01:26:55.919 --> 01:26:58.655
- Thanks for standing up for me!
- I'll miss you, buddy.

01:26:58.755 --> 01:26:59.972
Hey, hey.

01:27:10.517 --> 01:27:13.962
Good-bye, everybody! Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

01:27:14.062 --> 01:27:15.530
Wait! Stop!

01:27:27.159 --> 01:27:28.310
Good luck, Goddard!

01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:31.146
Bye, children.
And may the Lord bless your union.

01:27:31.246 --> 01:27:33.044
And have a wonderful honeymoon.

01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:37.152
- ...honeymoon!
- Honeymoon?

01:27:37.252 --> 01:27:38.344
Honeymoon, yeah!

01:27:47.095 --> 01:27:48.688
Hey! Stop that!

01:27:56.313 --> 01:27:57.881
What are you doing?

01:27:57.981 --> 01:28:01.827
You may not know this,
but these cans are worth a lot of money!

01:28:02.819 --> 01:28:04.412
Get in that car!

01:28:04.863 --> 01:28:06.115
Bye!

01:28:20.921 --> 01:28:23.407
What do you think you're doing?
That's my car!

01:28:23.507 --> 01:28:25.450
I paid good money for that car!

01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:27.160
I must've left the keys in there!

01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:28.995
Hey, wait a minute! Stop!

01:28:29.095 --> 01:28:30.831
What kind of a neighborhood is this?

01:28:30.931 --> 01:28:34.584
There's no cop around!
Somebody call 911!

01:28:34.684 --> 01:28:37.254
Wait! Hold it! Hold it!

01:28:37.354 --> 01:28:39.381
Somebody stop 'em!

01:28:39.481 --> 01:28:41.529
Where's a cop?

01:28:43.610 --> 01:28:46.363
- Will you leave me alone?
- It's him!

01:28:53.286 --> 01:28:55.647
- I'll kill you!
- He's crazy!

01:28:55.747 --> 01:28:57.420
- I'll kill you!
- That guy's crazy!
