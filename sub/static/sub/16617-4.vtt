ERICA: So, wait.
We're just gonna

09:08.248 --> 09:09.881
drive around aimlessly?

09:09.883 --> 09:12.317
Who's Aimless Lee and why would
we drive him around, huh?

09:12.319 --> 09:13.418
Boom. (laughs)

09:13.420 --> 09:14.419
Okay, I'm riding
with Lewis.

09:14.421 --> 09:15.587
Come on. Let's go.

09:15.589 --> 09:17.255
TODD: Let's just go.
Let's hit the road.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.791
I like it burned.

09:50.624 --> 09:53.692

10:08.941 --> 10:11.276
You're thinking about
him, aren't you?

10:11.278 --> 10:12.978
Hell's bells, Todd.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.980
Are we still on this?

10:14.982 --> 10:17.549
Yeah, we're still on this.
You're not over him, are you?

10:17.551 --> 10:20.151
You are such
an emotional minefield.

10:20.153 --> 10:21.553
Well, thank you
for the assessment.
(groans)

10:21.555 --> 10:24.055
That means so much coming from
someone as perfect as you.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.124
Well, thank you for finally
acknowledging my perfection.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.892
Well, you know, you
acknowledge it yourself

10:27.894 --> 10:29.961
so much all the time,
I figured, why not?

10:29.963 --> 10:31.963
How did it feel?
Oh, it felt great.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.498
Well, good for you.
No, good for you.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.500
Oh, good for us.
Good for us!

10:41.307 --> 10:42.907
Sorry.
Sorry.

10:42.909 --> 10:45.577
<i>(Tandy chuckles)</i>

10:52.952 --> 10:54.986
Want to play a game of I Spy?

10:54.988 --> 10:57.589
I'm gonna take a nap.

10:57.591 --> 11:00.825
I spy something
very trustworthy.

11:00.827 --> 11:03.828
It has hair.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.197
That hair is black.
(chuckles)

11:07.533 --> 11:09.334
It is conventionally handsome.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.602
(chuckles)

11:10.604 --> 11:13.538
I do not see color,
but it is Asian.

11:13.540 --> 11:15.874
(snoring)

11:15.876 --> 11:18.343
It is fake snoring. (laughs)

11:18.345 --> 11:22.147
It is having much more fun
than it's letting on.

11:22.149 --> 11:23.648
You give up?

11:23.650 --> 11:24.816
Lewis?

11:24.818 --> 11:26.551
Lewis?

11:27.653 --> 11:29.054
Lewis.

11:29.989 --> 11:32.557
Lewis.

11:32.559 --> 11:33.725
It was your seat belt!

11:33.727 --> 11:35.293

11:35.295 --> 11:36.961
JK.

11:36.963 --> 11:38.563
It was you.

11:38.565 --> 11:40.865
<i>(Carol exhales)</i>

11:40.867 --> 11:43.068
I'm burning up.
Could you hit the AC, please?

11:43.070 --> 11:44.502
Really? I'm freezing.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.171
Freezing?

11:46.173 --> 11:48.239
Well, must be
from heat poisoning.

11:48.241 --> 11:51.076
So, if you could just AC me,
full blast.

11:51.078 --> 11:53.511
I'm sorry, but I think that
this is a fair temperature.

11:53.513 --> 11:56.481
Well, should be nice and warm
for you down there in hell.

11:56.483 --> 11:58.249
Okay, what's that
supposed to mean?

11:58.251 --> 11:59.818
Just that when the day
of reckoning comes,

11:59.820 --> 12:02.153
I don't think Peter, Paul
or Mary will look too kindly

12:02.155 --> 12:04.155
on the fact that you denied
air conditioning

12:04.157 --> 12:05.223
to a pregnant woman.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.891
I'm pregnant, too!

12:06.893 --> 12:08.693
Oh, well, start acting like it!

12:08.695 --> 12:09.894
Oh, you want AC?

12:09.896 --> 12:11.196
Oh, what gave you that idea?

12:11.198 --> 12:12.430
Here, take it! Suck it down!

12:13.532 --> 12:14.599
(air blowing loudly)

12:17.870 --> 12:20.438
ERICA: This is Carol's fault
for running the AC full blast.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.740
(scoffs)

12:21.742 --> 12:23.041
Yeah, well,
Tandy's the idiot

12:23.043 --> 12:25.744
who picked 30-year-old
novelty cars for a road trip.

12:25.746 --> 12:27.512
They're American treasures,
Gail.

12:27.514 --> 12:28.580
TANDY:
Okay, okay, okay.

12:28.582 --> 12:30.048
Todd, Todd. Okay, look.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.250
Uh, w-we're all
a little tired and snippy,

12:32.252 --> 12:34.352
so let's switch up the mojo
a little bit.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.721
Remember, we still got two cars,
so if there's anyone

12:36.723 --> 12:39.691
you don't want to ride with,
just hop in the other car.

12:51.470 --> 12:53.772
I am so glad to not be
in the same car as Tandy.

12:53.774 --> 12:56.307
If I had to ride with him,
I would literally kill myself

12:56.309 --> 12:58.276
and probably take others
with me.

12:58.278 --> 13:01.279

13:01.281 --> 13:02.580

We're on a frickin' prison bus.

Danny Partridge was in
<i>The Partridge Family,</i>

15:27.093 --> 15:30.395
and he then went on to be in
a movie called<i> The Jerk Theory,</i>

15:30.397 --> 15:33.031
which was written and directed
by Scott S. Anderson,

15:33.033 --> 15:37.602
uh, who was acting
in the movie<i> Midway to Heaven,</i>

15:37.604 --> 15:40.371
uh, which, of course,
stared Kirby Heyborne, who is in

15:40.373 --> 15:43.408
a video short called<i> I Want</i>
<i>My Hat Back</i> with Galen Fott,

15:43.410 --> 15:46.978
who did a small part in the show
<i>Nashville</i> with Katie Couric.

15:46.980 --> 15:48.613
So there it is.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.648
Tandy, I usually have your back,

15:50.650 --> 15:53.318
but today you've been
a real pain in the front.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.253
Hey, there's something
up there!

15:55.255 --> 15:57.288
TODD:
Oh, my God, I see it, too.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.790
Maybe they have food!

15:58.792 --> 16:00.725
Or water.
Oh, hell,

16:00.727 --> 16:02.126
I just want to sit
in the shade.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.462
See, I told you.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.464
It's all part
of the no-plan plan,

16:06.466 --> 16:08.333
or should I say
"Noah-plan plan."

16:08.335 --> 16:09.901
Noah's ark. Boom.

16:09.903 --> 16:13.171
(chuckles) Whatever it is,
I'm sure it's gonna be great.

16:13.173 --> 16:15.606
LEWIS: (sighs) A patio
furniture store.

16:15.608 --> 16:17.008
Couldn't have been
a freakin' supermarket

16:17.010 --> 16:18.776
or an auto dealership.

16:18.778 --> 16:22.146
Who would put a patio furniture
store in the middle of nowhere?

16:22.148 --> 16:24.682
Well, rent must be dirt cheap.

16:24.684 --> 16:27.118
That leads to low prices,
good value.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.853
People make the journey.

16:32.791 --> 16:34.192
TANDY:
Ah.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.260
Ah. Hmm.

16:36.262 --> 16:37.929
We could sleep
in these chaises.

16:37.931 --> 16:40.031
We need to figure out
where we're going.

16:40.033 --> 16:41.766
Why? It's been
working out so far.

16:41.768 --> 16:43.334
Are you freakin' high?

16:43.336 --> 16:44.502
Yeah, we need a plan.

16:44.504 --> 16:45.937
We don't need a plan.

16:45.939 --> 16:47.972
I mean, do you think
Noah had a plan

16:47.974 --> 16:49.974
when he, like,
took out those...?

16:49.976 --> 16:51.709
Tandy, can I talk
with you for a minute?

16:51.711 --> 16:53.277
But I'm-I'm...
uh, just...

16:53.279 --> 16:55.146
Come here.
Come over here.
Okay.

16:55.148 --> 16:56.547
One minute.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.049
(Carol whispering)

16:58.051 --> 16:59.984
(sputters)

16:59.986 --> 17:02.220
Okay. Okay, uh, new deal.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.989
The next natural step
in our no-plan plan

17:04.991 --> 17:07.158
will be the plan phase.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.327
TODD:
<i>Oh, come on, guys,</i>

17:09.329 --> 17:12.196
I am telling you, Tampa would
make a great place to live!

17:12.198 --> 17:13.398
One vote for Tampa.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.532
ERICA:
I'm not moving

17:14.534 --> 17:15.900
all the way to Tampa!

17:15.902 --> 17:18.336
Vancouver's only, like,
15 hours away.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.671
All right, Vancouver.
That's crazy!

17:20.673 --> 17:22.807
Do you know how far
Vancouver is from Dollywood?

17:22.809 --> 17:23.875
Ugh!
ERICA:
Oh, my God.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.576
If we're just yelling out

17:25.578 --> 17:27.678
completely absurd things,
I want to move to Mount Everest.

17:27.680 --> 17:28.980
Mount Everest.

17:28.982 --> 17:30.381
Okay, it's been over two hours.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.350
Somebody pick a place.

17:32.352 --> 17:34.218
Portland is gonna
give us our best chance

17:34.220 --> 17:36.254
at sustainable food sources.

17:36.256 --> 17:38.322
Guys, we could already be
in Tampa right now,

17:38.324 --> 17:41.926
sipping from the fresh waters
of the Hillsborough River!

17:41.928 --> 17:44.395
Just pick a freakin' place.
ERICA:
God, if you love Tampa

17:44.397 --> 17:45.897
so much,
why don't you just marry it?

17:45.899 --> 17:47.265
Well, I'll tell you what.
Tampa would make

17:47.267 --> 17:49.033
a wonderful wife
with its low climate

17:49.035 --> 17:50.735
and loving coastal breezes.
TANDY: Montana.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.503
It's a big sky country.

17:52.505 --> 17:55.206
Vancouver is obviously
the place that we need!

17:55.208 --> 17:58.176
(overlapping shouting)

17:58.178 --> 18:00.711
Okay. Forget this mess.

18:00.713 --> 18:02.113
I'm out.

18:02.115 --> 18:05.116
Gail, where are you going?!

18:05.118 --> 18:07.418
I'm going to Napa.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.887
Well, what if Lewis and I
don't want to go to Napa?

18:09.889 --> 18:11.289
Then don't go.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.390
What?!

18:12.392 --> 18:14.192
Come on.
We got to stick together.

18:14.194 --> 18:15.560
Do we?

18:15.562 --> 18:17.562
I mean, we're all that's left.

18:17.564 --> 18:20.965
Whether it was by,
you know, chance or fate,

18:20.967 --> 18:23.201
there's something
that brought us all together.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.470
We can't just go off
into the night.

18:25.472 --> 18:29.273
Oh, don't make one of
your dumb-ass speeches, Tandy.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.742
Oh, hell, I have heard them
so many times,

18:31.744 --> 18:33.478
I know them by heart.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.413
"We can't just go off
into the night.

18:35.415 --> 18:38.616
"We have to go on
into the day. Boom.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.251
"We got to
stick together.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.453
"Together?
I hardly knew 'er. Boom.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.388
"We're Noah's ark. Look at us.

18:44.390 --> 18:45.823
"I'm Noah,

18:45.825 --> 18:47.959
and you're all
the animals."

18:47.961 --> 18:50.728
That about the gist of it, Noah?

18:50.730 --> 18:53.064
It's pretty close.

18:53.066 --> 18:55.399
I don't know about
the rest of you guys.

18:56.835 --> 19:00.071
For me,
I think my time has come.

19:01.573 --> 19:03.708
Gail, come on. Wait.

19:05.110 --> 19:06.644
We're a family.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.247
I got news for you.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.482
We're<i> not</i> a family.

19:13.018 --> 19:15.086
We're all just a bunch of people

19:15.088 --> 19:18.689
who happened to meet
at the end of the world.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.525
Catch you on the flippity.

19:31.436 --> 19:33.104
So you're just gonna go?

19:33.106 --> 19:34.639
What gave me away, Todd?

19:34.641 --> 19:37.108
Maybe we all just need
to take a little nap.

19:37.110 --> 19:38.943
Why don't we
pull up a chaise,

19:38.945 --> 19:41.812
and we can just talk it out
outdoor slumber party style?

19:41.814 --> 19:44.115
Hey, guys!

19:44.117 --> 19:46.050
Melissa, what are you
doing up there, hon?

19:46.052 --> 19:48.019
Just checking out the view.
You got to see this.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.353
Oh, just give me
a second, okay?

19:49.355 --> 19:50.821
Gail's leaving.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.123
Bye, Gail.

19:52.125 --> 19:53.558
Bye, hon. Take care.

19:53.560 --> 19:56.994
You should really see this
before you go. It's really cool.

19:56.996 --> 19:59.830
Todd, go get her down
from there.

19:59.832 --> 20:03.401
Okay, just don't-don't go.
I'll be back in a minute, okay?

20:03.403 --> 20:06.204
I hear chaises are really good
for your back.

20:08.340 --> 20:09.540
It's so pretty.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.175
Yeah, you know,
I'm-I'm sure it is.

20:11.177 --> 20:13.711
Now please just
come-come down here, hon.

20:13.713 --> 20:16.214
You're not even gonna
look at it?
Look at what?

20:16.216 --> 20:17.915
That.

20:26.925 --> 20:30.761
Hey, guys,
you should come see this!

20:33.699 --> 20:36.934
MELISSA:
Isn't it pretty?

20:36.936 --> 20:38.836
(whispers):
What the hell?
