<i>Previously on</i> The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.987 --> 00:06.615
<i>For over a century,</i>
<i>I have lived in secret until now.</i>

00:06.790 --> 00:08.655
<i>I know the risk,</i>
<i>but I have to know her.</i>

00:08.825 --> 00:10.952
- What are you?
- I'm a vampire.

00:11.127 --> 00:12.617
He told me about your ex.

00:12.829 --> 00:15.764
- Katherine, she broke your heart.
- That was a long time ago.

00:15.932 --> 00:17.923
How do we look exactly alike?

00:18.101 --> 00:20.092
I don't want you
seeing Elena anymore.

00:20.303 --> 00:23.966
If you don't remove her from your life,
I will kill everyone that she loves.

00:24.140 --> 00:27.075
She wants us to fight.
She wants to get between us.

00:27.277 --> 00:28.301
She already has, Elena.

00:30.880 --> 00:31.938
Katherine.

00:32.148 --> 00:33.945
We're gonna have
so much fun together.

00:34.117 --> 00:35.846
The Lockwoods are werewolves.

00:36.019 --> 00:38.681
The werewolf gene
runs in the Lockwood family.

00:38.855 --> 00:41.551
- Tried to kill a werewolf and failed.
- Unh!

00:41.725 --> 00:43.920
I feel like I'm not living up
to my best self.

00:44.094 --> 00:45.118
Now you made an enemy.

00:45.295 --> 00:48.458
- Tell me what triggers the curse.
- You have to kill somebody.

00:53.737 --> 00:57.036
All right, Carlos, that's it for me.

00:57.240 --> 00:58.969
You got it.

00:59.142 --> 01:00.700
Good night.

01:03.146 --> 01:06.081
<i>Are you with us</i>

01:06.750 --> 01:09.412
<i>Or against us?</i>

01:11.154 --> 01:12.485
- Mason.
- Whoa.

01:12.689 --> 01:13.883
Hey, Jimmy, easy.

01:14.958 --> 01:17.119
- Let's get you home.
- Screw you.

01:17.327 --> 01:20.387
- I know about you and Marla.
- What are you talking about?

01:20.997 --> 01:23.591
You've had too much to drink, let's...

01:24.100 --> 01:25.795
Dude, what's up? It's me, Mason.

01:25.969 --> 01:27.698
I'm not messing with Marla.
You know that.

01:32.575 --> 01:35.135
- You don't wanna do this, buddy.
- I'm gonna kill you.

01:53.429 --> 01:57.297
Jimmy. Jimmy.

02:02.305 --> 02:04.535
<i>Wait. The guy died?</i>

02:04.741 --> 02:05.833
You killed him?

02:06.042 --> 02:09.533
He kept coming at me, got it in his head
that I was sleeping with his girlfriend.

02:09.711 --> 02:12.237
- Well, were you?
- No, no.

02:12.415 --> 02:14.906
I wouldn't do that. He was my friend.

02:15.118 --> 02:17.552
He was drunk and attacked me.
It was self-defense.

02:17.754 --> 02:19.119
And it triggered the curse.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.824
On every full moon, I lose control.

02:27.463 --> 02:29.795
If I don't sedate myself
and chain myself down...

02:29.966 --> 02:32.366
...I'll kill anything in my path.

02:33.203 --> 02:35.398
You have to be careful.

02:35.572 --> 02:38.063
All it takes is an accident, a car wreck.

02:38.274 --> 02:43.075
Any death at your hands
and you'll have a lifetime of this.

02:43.546 --> 02:45.537
You don't want it, Tyler, trust me.

02:59.229 --> 03:00.856
All right, where's the moonstone?

03:01.064 --> 03:03.862
Deal's a deal.
I answered your questions.

03:04.334 --> 03:05.358
Um...

03:06.870 --> 03:11.603
Yeah, I'm not sure,
but I'm guessing it's in here.

03:12.575 --> 03:15.237
My dad, he was very kooky
about his hiding spots...

03:15.411 --> 03:18.380
...but I've figured most of them out
over the years.

03:29.759 --> 03:31.624
It's all yours.

03:33.029 --> 03:35.691
You gonna tell me
what's so important about this rock?

03:35.899 --> 03:38.129
I told you, it's just something I want.

03:38.301 --> 03:40.292
Sentimental value.

03:41.004 --> 03:42.938
Yeah, I'm not really buying that.

03:44.474 --> 03:47.500
- Why do you really want it?
- Do you know where it is or not?

03:48.912 --> 03:51.278
No, I figured it'd be in here, man.

03:53.650 --> 03:56.050
I can't believe
Tyler Lockwood's a werewolf.

03:56.219 --> 03:57.811
We're not sure about that yet.

03:57.987 --> 04:00.820
The only thing we know for sure
is that Mason Lockwood is.

04:00.990 --> 04:03.788
That should be easy enough for us
to figure out.

04:04.294 --> 04:07.889
There is no us. I said that I wouldn't
keep things from you anymore.

04:08.064 --> 04:10.157
That doesn't mean
that I want you involved in it.

04:11.534 --> 04:14.025
By definition of being in this family,
I'm involved.

04:14.504 --> 04:17.529
This is dangerous, Jeremy.
You have to stay out of it, okay?

04:17.740 --> 04:19.833
All right. Just saying.

04:32.155 --> 04:33.486
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

04:33.656 --> 04:34.850
Uh...

04:36.092 --> 04:38.560
Right. Right.

04:45.935 --> 04:47.493
Hi.

04:47.670 --> 04:49.035
Hey.

04:50.440 --> 04:53.204
- You ready for today?
- No.

04:54.811 --> 04:57.006
I hate fighting with you,
even if it's fake.

04:57.213 --> 04:59.977
I know, but if Katherine thinks
that we're fighting...

05:00.183 --> 05:01.980
...she'll think she's winning.

05:02.151 --> 05:04.278
That keeps her from
following through on her threats.

05:04.520 --> 05:07.045
Yeah, but that doesn't make it
any easier.

05:07.223 --> 05:09.691
Neither does knowing
that Caroline will be there...

05:09.859 --> 05:11.588
...reporting everything back to her.

05:11.761 --> 05:13.888
Hey, everything's gonna be okay.

05:14.097 --> 05:18.534
Yes, we have to keep up this ruse
for a little while.

05:18.701 --> 05:22.933
But it's the best way to keep Katherine
from hurting anybody, from hurting you.

05:23.139 --> 05:25.607
Just promise me
that she won't get her way with us.

05:25.775 --> 05:31.736
We can fake a fight, we can pretend
that her threats are tearing us apart...

05:31.914 --> 05:33.745
...but none of it's real, okay?

05:33.950 --> 05:35.315
Okay, how about this?

05:35.551 --> 05:41.512
Today, when we're fighting, if I say,
"I can't do this anymore, Elena"...

05:41.724 --> 05:44.522
...what I'll really mean
is that I love you.

05:46.662 --> 05:50.154
And when I say,
"Fine, Stefan, whatever"...

05:50.800 --> 05:52.290
...really means I love you too.

05:52.935 --> 05:53.993
Deal.

05:55.438 --> 05:56.871
- Mm.
- Mm.

06:05.815 --> 06:07.043
Are you off today?

06:07.250 --> 06:09.616
The Historical Society Volunteer Picnic
is today.

06:09.786 --> 06:12.186
- You're the one who signed me up.
- Oh, I know.

06:12.422 --> 06:14.253
I just assumed you'd bail.

06:14.457 --> 06:16.550
Nope. Gonna spend the whole day
with my daughter.

06:16.759 --> 06:18.989
You're gonna pretend to be a mother?

06:19.695 --> 06:22.255
- I'll bring my gun if it gets rough.
- Hmm.

06:22.432 --> 06:23.831
Come on, give me one day.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.264
I've been buried in work.
I've barely seen you.

06:26.436 --> 06:28.097
Well, be warned. I'm in a mood.

06:28.504 --> 06:29.528
Goody for me.

06:30.973 --> 06:33.305
What was Elena doing here
so late last night?

06:33.843 --> 06:35.936
Elena wasn't...

06:36.145 --> 06:39.672
Yes. Um, Elena was here.

06:40.349 --> 06:42.647
Uh, she just needed to talk.

06:42.819 --> 06:45.083
Her and Stefan
are going through a rough patch.

06:46.956 --> 06:48.287
Is everything okay with you?

06:49.826 --> 06:53.091
- I'm fine.
- It's just lately, you've seemed different.

06:54.130 --> 06:56.325
I'm not different. I'm fine.

06:56.532 --> 06:59.729
Look, I know you think
I don't notice these things, but I do.

06:59.969 --> 07:01.368
What's going on with you?

07:02.004 --> 07:05.997
You know, there's pretending
to be a mother, and then there's reality.

07:06.209 --> 07:08.336
Let's not push our luck, okay?

07:20.456 --> 07:23.482
MRS. LOCKWOOD: This is part of the
Historical Society's continuing efforts...

07:23.693 --> 07:25.422
...to give back to the community.

07:25.661 --> 07:28.357
Thanks to the generous donation
of the Fell family...

07:28.564 --> 07:31.556
...we are now standing on the site
of our newest public park.

07:31.767 --> 07:35.134
Thank you to everyone who has
shown up today to lend a helping hand.

07:35.338 --> 07:36.737
Thanks.

07:44.780 --> 07:47.840
Stefan, right? The other Salvatore.

07:48.384 --> 07:49.874
- The nice one.
- Hmm.

07:50.052 --> 07:53.544
- The one offering an apology.
- Not interested.

07:53.923 --> 07:56.687
- Look, my brother acted impulsively.
- You think?

07:57.894 --> 08:00.124
You and Damon
keep at each other's throats...

08:00.296 --> 08:03.094
...somebody innocent is gonna get hurt.
I don't want that.

08:03.266 --> 08:06.429
You have family here, so I can't imagine
you'd want that either.

08:06.602 --> 08:10.436
So, what do you say we just, uh, quit
the whole alpha-male fighting thing...

08:11.207 --> 08:13.141
...and just call it a truce?

08:13.309 --> 08:15.243
I made that same offer
to your brother.

08:15.411 --> 08:18.278
- He turned it down, with a knife.
- He made a mistake.

08:18.748 --> 08:22.184
And I'm here to make sure that
neither one of you make another one.

08:23.219 --> 08:25.949
Tell your brother to watch his back.

08:27.590 --> 08:30.718
I'm guessing that he only has to worry
about that during a full moon.

08:30.927 --> 08:33.395
Otherwise, you're not as strong.
Am I right?

08:33.596 --> 08:35.587
Or you would have killed Damon
by now.

08:37.900 --> 08:41.597
There's one of you, there's two of us.

08:42.138 --> 08:44.698
I think you're the one
that needs to watch his back.

08:49.779 --> 08:52.771
- Lf he comes at me...
- He won't.

09:04.827 --> 09:08.228
- What are you doing?
- Negotiating peace on your behalf.

09:08.397 --> 09:12.231
- But I don't want peace.
- Well, consider it Opposite Day.

09:12.435 --> 09:15.302
Stefan, please tell me
you don't seriously think...

09:15.471 --> 09:17.803
...a handshake
just solved our problem.

09:17.974 --> 09:21.137
No, actually, I think that the first chance
Mason Lockwood gets...

09:21.310 --> 09:24.473
...he's gonna drive a stake through
your heart, and then through mine.

09:24.647 --> 09:27.343
All because you took it upon yourself
to try to kill him.

09:27.550 --> 09:30.644
So thank you, because
we don't have enough problems.

09:35.591 --> 09:37.684
<i>Sometimes you might find</i>
<i>You feel a little like</i>

09:37.860 --> 09:40.590
<i>You're on the wrong side of life</i>

09:40.763 --> 09:45.097
<i>Where there's no light</i>
<i>But it's gonna turn around sometime</i>

09:45.268 --> 09:49.364
- When did Jeremy Gilbert get so cute?
- Oh, no.

09:49.572 --> 09:52.700
Stay away, that guy's damaged goods.

09:52.875 --> 09:56.504
<i>Close to the bone</i>
<i>But still too far away</i>

09:56.679 --> 09:59.477
- Hey, man, how've you been?
- Since when?

09:59.649 --> 10:01.810
I haven't seen you much
since your father's funeral.

10:02.018 --> 10:05.181
- I just figured that maybe you'd want...
- I'm fine, Gilbert.

10:05.354 --> 10:06.378
Yeah, okay.

10:09.225 --> 10:11.193
Wait, hold up.

10:11.927 --> 10:13.053
I'm sorry.

10:14.497 --> 10:16.089
Bad day. Bad month.

10:16.866 --> 10:19.391
Listen, you were cool that day,
at the wake.

10:20.002 --> 10:21.902
Thanks for that.

10:22.071 --> 10:23.936
Felt like kind of a freak show.

10:24.173 --> 10:26.266
Yeah, well, I know the feeling well.

10:26.442 --> 10:29.206
- What are you doing here?
- Distracting myself.

10:29.378 --> 10:31.676
Hey, thanks for the text.

10:31.847 --> 10:33.747
- Where to?
- My place.

10:33.949 --> 10:36.884
My mom's gone all day, empty house,
fully stocked bar.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.419
- Margaritas?
- Sure.

10:39.922 --> 10:41.549
You in?

10:42.024 --> 10:45.323
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm in.
- Let's do it.

10:49.332 --> 10:50.526
Oh, thanks, Mason.

10:50.933 --> 10:53.424
- Hey, sheriff, you got a second?
- I'm out of uniform.

10:53.602 --> 10:57.094
- Let's go with Liz.
- All right, Liz.

10:58.341 --> 11:00.809
I was hoping to talk to you
about the Council.

11:00.976 --> 11:02.807
I don't know
what you're talking about.

11:02.978 --> 11:05.970
I know you and the other founding families
have a secret council.

11:06.215 --> 11:10.345
Then you'd know it's a secret and isn't
discussed with non-Council members.

11:10.553 --> 11:13.954
I know I rejected all that, but it's because
I wanted a life outside of this town.

11:14.123 --> 11:17.092
Not because I was a non-believer.

11:17.293 --> 11:19.124
Look, I know vampires exist.

11:19.362 --> 11:22.490
And you have two of them
living right under your nose.

11:22.665 --> 11:23.893
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.624
And who would they be?

11:27.436 --> 11:28.869
Damon and Stefan Salvatore.

11:31.307 --> 11:33.275
That's impossible.

11:33.442 --> 11:36.104
I know Damon. Do you know
what he's done for this town?

11:36.312 --> 11:38.576
- I know it's a lot to digest.
- No, no, no.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.612
I have watched him kill vampires.

11:40.816 --> 11:43.512
- He's an ally, he's part of the Council.
- Think about it.

11:43.753 --> 11:45.186
When did the vampire attacks begin?

11:45.688 --> 11:47.622
When Damon and Stefan
moved to town?

11:47.790 --> 11:51.590
- They walk in the sun, Mason.
- They've evolved. It's not 1864.

11:51.761 --> 11:54.195
They've figured it out, Liz.

11:55.097 --> 11:57.930
No. Damon Salvatore is my friend.

12:04.974 --> 12:07.704
What if I can prove it to you?

12:15.551 --> 12:18.850
So suddenly, she's in the
running for Mother of the Year...

12:19.021 --> 12:21.956
...just when I'm trying
to avoid her the most.

12:22.291 --> 12:24.691
I'm babbling.
You don't wanna hear all this.

12:24.860 --> 12:27.761
Oh, um, no, sorry.

12:27.930 --> 12:29.261
Then what happened?

12:29.698 --> 12:34.465
Well, I was a bitch,
which is par for the course with us.

12:37.206 --> 12:40.107
So how are things with you and Stefan?
Anything?

12:41.477 --> 12:42.774
No, not since the fight.

12:43.479 --> 12:45.709
He's been pushing me away
because he thinks...

12:45.915 --> 12:48.611
...that Katherine
might get jealous enough to hurt me.

12:48.784 --> 12:51.309
I just don't know
how to change his mind.

12:52.955 --> 12:57.949
You said that Katherine's dangerous,
and maybe he's got a point.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.253
Yeah, I know that she's dangerous...

13:00.429 --> 13:05.059
...and I know that he's just trying
to protect me, but it feels like giving up.

13:05.234 --> 13:07.464
And I just...

13:08.070 --> 13:09.401
Just what?

13:10.773 --> 13:13.071
I just thought
that we were stronger than that.

13:18.214 --> 13:21.183
Hey, I saw you with Mason earlier.
What was that about?

13:21.350 --> 13:24.786
Oh, I, uh... I just asked him to help
with the cleanup in the woods.

13:25.287 --> 13:27.448
That's what I'm here for.
Put me to work.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.852
- Should I go help him?
- Oh, no, no.

13:31.026 --> 13:34.462
You know what? L... He's...
I'm sure he's fine.

13:36.665 --> 13:37.791
You okay, Liz?

13:39.268 --> 13:40.633
You seem really upset.

13:41.270 --> 13:43.761
It's Caroline. We had a moment.

13:45.307 --> 13:47.502
Is there anything I can do?

13:47.676 --> 13:50.270
No, Damon. Thank you.

13:50.779 --> 13:55.113
It's just my horrible parenting skills
paying off in spades.

14:05.828 --> 14:06.852
Uh-oh.

14:07.329 --> 14:10.025
Longing looks are being exchanged.

14:10.266 --> 14:15.169
- I'm gonna go talk to him.
- No, Elena, I think it's a bad idea.

14:20.709 --> 14:23.371
- What's her problem?
- Don't worry about it.

14:24.179 --> 14:27.012
Why are you being such a bitch
to your mom?

14:27.383 --> 14:29.510
Don't worry about it.

14:32.187 --> 14:34.712
Do you still care about Katherine?

14:34.924 --> 14:37.825
Don't do this. Don't turn this
into something that it's not.

14:38.160 --> 14:41.596
So this isn't up for discussion.
That's what you're saying?

14:41.797 --> 14:45.028
No, I'm saying that this isn't up
for discussion right now...

14:45.234 --> 14:47.327
...because we have ears on us.

14:50.873 --> 14:52.932
- Okay. When?
- I don't know.

14:53.909 --> 14:57.436
I saw her, Stefan.
It's like we're the same person.

14:57.613 --> 15:01.379
How could you hate her
and be in love with me?

15:01.817 --> 15:04.012
You're reaching. I'm not... I'm not Damon.

15:04.219 --> 15:07.211
How about we don't bring Damon
into this right now?

15:07.856 --> 15:08.948
You know what? I can't.

15:10.859 --> 15:13.726
I can't do this anymore, Elena.

15:16.732 --> 15:20.429
Fine, Stefan.

15:20.603 --> 15:22.264
Whatever.

15:24.773 --> 15:26.968
Relationships
are about communication.

15:39.622 --> 15:41.647
Hey. Where's mine?

15:41.857 --> 15:43.586
Have at it.

15:44.159 --> 15:47.890
Thanks for having us over.
I think Sarah's got a thing for Jeremy.

15:48.063 --> 15:49.792
Well, good for Sarah.

15:50.466 --> 15:51.763
Um, ha...

15:51.934 --> 15:55.267
Look, I'm really embarrassed
about slutting it up with you that day...

15:55.471 --> 15:56.870
...at the swimming hole.

15:57.072 --> 16:00.064
- I'm really not like that, I promise.
- No need to apologize.

16:00.909 --> 16:02.570
- Friends?
- Yeah, sure.

16:10.819 --> 16:12.650
Can I see?

16:12.821 --> 16:14.618
Uh, no, no, no way.

16:14.790 --> 16:16.690
- I wanna see.
- Yeah, let's see.

16:17.693 --> 16:19.160
What's Van Gogh got going on?

16:20.195 --> 16:22.026
Okay, yeah. Uh, check it out.

16:24.867 --> 16:28.894
Ooh, scary demon-wolf thing, ha, ha.

16:36.545 --> 16:37.773
What's this about?

16:38.180 --> 16:41.115
Just some sketches.
You still draw, Tyler?

16:41.784 --> 16:45.185
A little, but not much.

16:46.622 --> 16:48.886
I've got something
that I'm actually working on.

16:49.058 --> 16:51.492
- Come on, I'll show you.
- Yeah, okay, sure.

16:52.795 --> 16:54.729
- It's nothing special.
- You need a drink.

16:54.897 --> 16:56.558
It's pretty much amateur hour here.

16:56.899 --> 16:59.060
Uh, no, I've seen your
stuff before. It's great.

16:59.234 --> 17:01.031
It's on the desk.

17:04.673 --> 17:06.071
Uh...

17:07.675 --> 17:11.442
I don't really see it any...

17:13.315 --> 17:15.407
What are those pictures about, huh?

17:15.584 --> 17:17.175
I can't breathe.

17:17.386 --> 17:19.479
Answer me. Why?

17:19.688 --> 17:21.053
Why wolf pictures?

17:21.890 --> 17:24.983
Because... Because I know.

17:28.964 --> 17:30.829
You know what?

17:30.999 --> 17:32.830
You know what, Jeremy?

17:33.202 --> 17:35.067
I know what you are.

17:37.506 --> 17:39.906
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

17:41.076 --> 17:42.373
Hello, Mason.

17:42.911 --> 17:45.175
- Working hard?
- Doing my part.

17:45.380 --> 17:47.780
- I heard you talked to Stefan.
- Nice guy.

17:48.016 --> 17:51.179
- Yeah, a lot nicer than me.
- Well, nice is overrated.

17:52.020 --> 17:53.920
That's what I think. Ha.

17:55.090 --> 17:56.717
You have a good day, Damon.

17:59.061 --> 18:02.224
Please tell me
that you were just bonding.

18:02.431 --> 18:06.527
So, what's up with this, um, faux drama
in your relationship?

18:07.302 --> 18:09.702
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, come on, Stefan.

18:09.872 --> 18:13.364
You and Elena don't fight.
Especially not over me.

18:14.009 --> 18:15.374
Drop it, Damon.

18:16.645 --> 18:17.942
With pleasure.

18:18.147 --> 18:21.639
- Would you like some lemonade?
- Thank you, sweetie.

18:27.689 --> 18:29.384
What's wrong with you?

18:30.425 --> 18:34.122
Vervain. Vervain.

18:56.518 --> 18:57.610
You okay?

18:58.654 --> 18:59.985
Nope.

19:01.523 --> 19:02.820
Maybe it's for the best.

19:03.025 --> 19:06.517
It's not for the best, Caroline.
None of this is for the best.

19:09.431 --> 19:12.958
I'm sorry, okay? I...

19:13.735 --> 19:15.498
I don't mean to take it out on you.

19:15.737 --> 19:18.001
You're just being a good friend.

19:21.810 --> 19:22.834
No, I'm not.

19:23.545 --> 19:27.379
I'm not being a good friend at all.

19:30.552 --> 19:31.610
Is she leaving?

19:33.488 --> 19:35.149
Where is my mom going?

19:37.359 --> 19:38.519
Look, I can't talk here.

19:38.694 --> 19:42.027
Just get Jess and meet me down the hill
at the entrance, and bring a...

19:42.197 --> 19:45.030
- Yes, we need it.
- What's wrong?

19:45.267 --> 19:48.065
- Oh, nothing, I, uh... I just have something...
- You mean work?

19:48.303 --> 19:51.136
You surprised me.
You lasted longer than five minutes.

19:51.540 --> 19:53.974
- It's important.
- It always is.

19:54.409 --> 19:56.377
I'm sorry.

20:00.082 --> 20:03.176
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

20:04.586 --> 20:06.349
Something's up.

20:08.924 --> 20:10.118
Oh, it burns.

20:14.096 --> 20:15.290
- I'm gonna kill him.
- No.

20:15.497 --> 20:17.488
- No more Mr. Nice Guy.
- Sit, sit, sit.

20:17.666 --> 20:20.157
I'm not listening to more
of your "give peace a chance" crap.

20:20.335 --> 20:21.632
- He's dead.
- Okay.

20:23.005 --> 20:24.029
Okay.

20:24.673 --> 20:26.664
I don't like it, but he's making threats.

20:26.842 --> 20:29.276
He could expose us.
We need to put him down.

20:29.444 --> 20:31.605
All right. Let's do it.

20:33.682 --> 20:35.274
The woods.

20:35.450 --> 20:36.815
Trash duty. Come on.

20:39.354 --> 20:42.949
Where are you going?
What's going on?

20:43.191 --> 20:45.352
I need to be able to hear better.

20:45.527 --> 20:46.721
Hear what?

20:47.429 --> 20:49.021
Something's wrong, Elena.

20:51.934 --> 20:53.401
- Caroline...
- Shh. Shh.

21:05.447 --> 21:08.416
Don't look so surprised.
You knew this was inevitable.

21:10.152 --> 21:12.347
Go ahead. Run.

21:12.554 --> 21:14.215
I'll give you a head start.

21:22.130 --> 21:23.893
- Oh, God.
- What is it?

21:24.066 --> 21:26.557
- It's Stefan and Damon.
- What?

21:27.235 --> 21:28.862
Thank you, Mason.

21:44.753 --> 21:46.653
How do you know about all this?

21:47.189 --> 21:49.783
My Uncle John
left this old diary lying around.

21:50.425 --> 21:52.586
It was written
by a crazy Gilbert ancestor...

21:52.761 --> 21:55.696
...who wrote about this curse
that ran in your family.

21:55.864 --> 21:58.833
- Curse about what?
- Werewolves.

22:00.335 --> 22:01.859
It's crazy, right?

22:02.070 --> 22:04.971
But then Matt was attacked
by a wolf under a full moon...

22:05.140 --> 22:07.005
...and your uncle had just gotten back.

22:07.209 --> 22:10.269
It was just... It was too weird.

22:10.812 --> 22:11.836
Is it true?

22:13.682 --> 22:14.706
About my uncle?

22:17.986 --> 22:19.510
Yeah.

22:19.688 --> 22:21.849
- But you, you're not?
- A wolf?

22:22.090 --> 22:25.218
I'm sorry, werewolf? No.

22:25.694 --> 22:28.663
I mean, not yet.

22:28.864 --> 22:32.129
You know, hell, just saying that
out loud, I sound insane.

22:32.334 --> 22:33.801
No, I don't think so.

22:34.302 --> 22:37.169
But then again,
I always did believe in the crazy stuff.

22:37.739 --> 22:40.230
According to my uncle,
you have to trigger the curse.

22:40.475 --> 22:44.343
Somebody has to die at your hands,
like murder or an accident.

22:44.880 --> 22:47.542
I basically have to cause death,
and then, boom.

22:47.716 --> 22:49.809
Next full moon,
I'm howling on all fours.

22:50.318 --> 22:51.546
Was that why he came back?

22:51.720 --> 22:53.711
- To tell you all this?
- Yeah, right.

22:53.922 --> 22:56.516
He had to tell me. I caught him.

22:56.725 --> 22:58.886
He's not here for me.

23:02.564 --> 23:03.656
He's here for this.

23:08.837 --> 23:11.067
It's down the stairs to the left.

23:15.410 --> 23:18.243
Careful. Bullets and vervain
won't keep them down for long.

23:18.413 --> 23:20.381
- What is this place?
- Old slave quarters.

23:20.549 --> 23:22.449
From the original Lockwood house.

23:25.454 --> 23:28.014
Thank you, Mason.
I appreciate all you've done.

23:28.223 --> 23:29.247
We got it from here.

23:31.793 --> 23:34.091
- Hey, you're gonna kill them, right?
- Yes.

23:34.262 --> 23:37.254
That's why you should go.
I'm here as the Council, not the law.

23:37.432 --> 23:40.060
You can't be a party to this.
It's for your own protection.

23:40.235 --> 23:43.363
- Liz, I don't care about...
- Yes, but I do, and I'm not asking.

23:43.538 --> 23:44.562
Goodbye, Mason.

23:50.679 --> 23:52.670
Don't take any chances.

24:01.590 --> 24:03.217
- What is it?
- They've been here.

24:07.062 --> 24:08.620
What?

24:12.901 --> 24:14.630
What are you two doing out here?

24:15.704 --> 24:16.898
Have you seen Stefan?

24:17.305 --> 24:19.330
Yeah, Elena, I've seen him.

24:19.508 --> 24:20.839
Seen Damon too.

24:21.943 --> 24:24.810
- Well, where are they?
- You don't need me for that.

24:24.980 --> 24:27.414
I'll let your friend here sniff them out.

24:28.650 --> 24:31.016
Does your mother know what you are?

24:31.253 --> 24:32.515
I'm happy to tell her.

24:34.823 --> 24:36.313
Don't be stupid.

24:36.525 --> 24:38.083
Necks snap easy around here.

24:38.527 --> 24:39.653
I can take you.

24:40.128 --> 24:42.596
- Wanna bet?
- Yeah, I do.

24:46.301 --> 24:48.166
Told you.

24:55.544 --> 24:57.512
Come on.

25:09.357 --> 25:10.984
This is how it's gonna work.

25:11.459 --> 25:14.257
Answer me
and you don't get shot, understand?

25:14.462 --> 25:15.793
How many of you are there?

25:15.997 --> 25:18.295
Liz, please.

25:23.471 --> 25:26.372
How did you fool us?
How do you walk in the sun?

25:32.581 --> 25:35.345
I will drag this out painfully.

25:37.385 --> 25:39.353
But you're my friend.

25:40.288 --> 25:41.482
Our friendship was a lie.

25:43.525 --> 25:45.186
Answer me and I'll kill you fast.

25:49.531 --> 25:50.725
What is that?

25:52.534 --> 25:56.334
<i>He's not gonna tell us anything.</i>
<i>Kill them both.</i>

25:57.172 --> 25:58.696
Caroline.

25:58.907 --> 26:00.272
Caroline, what is it?

26:00.442 --> 26:02.933
My mom. She's killing them.

26:03.178 --> 26:04.509
What?

26:04.713 --> 26:06.442
- No, Elena, no.
- We have to stop her.

26:06.615 --> 26:09.584
No, I can't.
Elena, she's gonna find out about me.

26:11.419 --> 26:13.080
Elena.

26:15.357 --> 26:16.381
Let's do this.

26:16.558 --> 26:18.549
Each with a stake in the heart,
then burn them both.

26:20.595 --> 26:22.426
Check it out.

26:32.073 --> 26:33.597
Elena, what are you doing?

26:33.842 --> 26:36.208
You can't kill them.
I'm not gonna let you.

26:40.048 --> 26:42.039
- What was that?
- Who else is with you?

26:42.717 --> 26:43.911
What the...?

27:12.280 --> 27:13.440
Hi, Mom.

27:38.206 --> 27:41.539
- You need to drink some deputy blood.
- Oh, no.

27:42.444 --> 27:45.277
I'll be fine.
It's just gonna take a little bit longer. Unh!

27:45.447 --> 27:46.937
Damon's right, you know?

27:47.115 --> 27:49.208
If there was ever a time
to break your diet...

27:49.417 --> 27:51.817
He said he didn't want it, okay?

27:55.990 --> 27:58.083
This is a most unfortunate situation.

27:58.927 --> 28:00.292
Two deputies dead.

28:01.996 --> 28:05.329
And you.
What am I gonna do with you?

28:07.769 --> 28:09.566
You won't tell anyone, will you?

28:13.508 --> 28:16.409
Mom? Mom?

28:16.611 --> 28:18.272
Please.

28:18.446 --> 28:21.813
Look, I know that we don't get along
and that you hate me...

28:22.317 --> 28:26.219
...but I'm your daughter
and you'll do this for me, right?

28:27.589 --> 28:31.116
Mom, please, he will kill you.

28:33.661 --> 28:35.322
Then kill me.

28:35.530 --> 28:37.361
- No.
- I can't take this.

28:38.533 --> 28:40.228
Kill me, now.

28:42.771 --> 28:45.740
But you were gonna drag it out
so painfully.

28:47.108 --> 28:49.042
- No, no, no.
- Damon, don't.

28:49.277 --> 28:52.804
- Damon, please.
- Relax, guys, no one's killing anybody.

28:57.185 --> 28:59.176
You're my friend.

29:03.458 --> 29:05.824
We gotta clean this up.

29:07.262 --> 29:08.524
What is it?

29:08.763 --> 29:10.390
It's a moonstone.

29:10.565 --> 29:13.056
I looked it up online.
It's a natural rock...

29:13.268 --> 29:16.533
...but they're supposed to have
all sorts of supernatural legends...

29:16.704 --> 29:19.537
...attached to them.
- Well, why didn't you give it to him?

29:19.908 --> 29:21.068
Because he wants it.

29:22.444 --> 29:24.378
I'm a dick that way.

29:24.579 --> 29:28.345
It's important to him for some reason,
but I don't trust the guy.

29:28.516 --> 29:29.983
So I'm not just gonna hand it to him.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.921
- Found you.
- You guys are missing all the drinking.

29:35.523 --> 29:38.321
Oh, I'm sorry.
Were you two having a moment?

29:38.526 --> 29:39.891
No, we're good.

29:40.094 --> 29:41.686
- Hey, hey, what is that?
- It's...

29:41.863 --> 29:43.125
- Whoa, hey.
- Pretty.

29:43.298 --> 29:44.697
Mm-hm.

29:44.866 --> 29:47.562
- Let's not play with the rock.
- Well, come and get it.

29:47.735 --> 29:51.603
Look, I'll play along for a little bit,
but seriously, give it back.

29:51.806 --> 29:53.603
Lookie here.

29:53.842 --> 29:55.207
You snooze, you lose.

30:00.748 --> 30:02.579
You're lucky you're cute when drunk.

30:02.817 --> 30:04.409
I want Jeremy to come get it.

30:04.586 --> 30:08.181
- Give me a break.
- Sarah, don't be a bad drunk.

30:08.389 --> 30:11.950
Jeremy, come upstairs with me.
See how bad a drunk I can be.

30:12.193 --> 30:13.455
Uh, I'm good, thanks.

30:14.729 --> 30:17.197
- Come on. Seriously, just give it...
- Ah! Oh!

30:17.365 --> 30:18.889
- This isn't funny.
- Ha, ha.

30:19.100 --> 30:21.261
- Easy there, just let me...
- Hey, that hurts.

30:21.436 --> 30:23.165
- Let go.
- Hey, that hurts.

30:27.775 --> 30:30.073
- Sarah!
- Oh, my God. Sarah. Sarah.

30:30.278 --> 30:31.711
- She fell.
- She's not moving.

30:32.380 --> 30:33.870
Oh, my God.

30:35.984 --> 30:37.542
- Fooled you.
- Oh, my God.

30:40.588 --> 30:42.647
You pushed me down the stairs.

30:42.857 --> 30:44.415
Look, he didn't mean it, okay?

30:46.160 --> 30:49.254
- Okay. You got her?
- Yeah.

30:56.804 --> 30:59.329
Hey. Sorry that took forever.

30:59.507 --> 31:01.998
I just didn't know how long
my mom was gonna be here.

31:02.176 --> 31:06.112
Damon says it'll take three days tops
for the vervain to leave her system.

31:06.281 --> 31:08.408
Maybe even sooner.

31:09.450 --> 31:11.077
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:11.252 --> 31:12.742
Get some bunny in you?

31:12.921 --> 31:14.855
Yeah, feeling much better, thank you.

31:15.023 --> 31:16.991
A stomach bug.

31:17.158 --> 31:19.126
Yeah, it came on fast.

31:19.294 --> 31:20.989
I'll definitely be out tomorrow.

31:21.162 --> 31:22.186
Tsk. Tsk. Tsk.

31:23.998 --> 31:26.489
Or longer. I'll text you.

31:26.901 --> 31:30.166
Yeah, good night.

31:31.439 --> 31:32.906
Thank you.

31:35.343 --> 31:39.939
It's not exactly the Ritz, but it's secure.
Brought you a good thread count.

31:40.315 --> 31:43.216
Once the vervain has worked
its way out, I will compel you...

31:43.418 --> 31:46.649
...you will forget everything,
and you will be a free woman.

31:47.121 --> 31:49.419
Keep Caroline away from me, please.

31:51.459 --> 31:54.223
- I don't wanna see her.
- She's your daughter, Liz.

31:55.663 --> 31:56.925
Not anymore.

31:58.066 --> 32:00.000
My daughter's gone.

32:00.935 --> 32:04.063
You have no idea
how wrong you are about that.

32:39.540 --> 32:41.872
Stefan, I think that we should...

32:44.178 --> 32:45.406
What are you doing?

32:46.047 --> 32:49.744
Katherine took a little vervain every day
and built up a tolerance to it.

32:53.187 --> 32:55.747
I could do the same with blood.

32:55.923 --> 32:58.187
I could learn to control myself on it.

32:58.593 --> 33:01.562
But you can't, Stefan.
You don't have to.

33:04.365 --> 33:07.425
I almost died tonight, Elena.

33:07.635 --> 33:10.468
- Because I was too weak.
- The last time you drank human blood...

33:10.638 --> 33:13.038
Look, I told you I'd find a way
to stop Katherine.

33:13.207 --> 33:16.643
Well, this is it. This is the only way,
because she's stronger than me.

33:16.811 --> 33:19.780
And unless that changes,
I can't protect you.

33:19.947 --> 33:21.107
Can we talk later?

33:21.315 --> 33:24.807
He can hear us wherever we are
because he drinks this.

33:25.053 --> 33:27.419
This is the only thing
that can help me.

33:28.589 --> 33:30.022
Are you serious?

33:30.925 --> 33:32.415
Or are you pretending to fight?

33:32.593 --> 33:35.585
- Because I can't tell if...
- No, this is real.

33:36.064 --> 33:37.326
No more pretend.

33:56.684 --> 33:58.413
Can I take you home?

34:01.155 --> 34:03.020
I can't go home.

34:03.658 --> 34:04.750
Why not?

34:06.094 --> 34:08.062
Because I'm scared.

34:09.429 --> 34:10.920
Why are you scared?

34:12.033 --> 34:14.399
Caroline, you can talk to me.

34:16.237 --> 34:18.068
Katherine's gonna be there.

34:18.272 --> 34:23.574
And she's gonna want me to tell her
everything that happened today.

34:24.045 --> 34:28.311
She told me I had to spy on you
and report back to her.

34:28.549 --> 34:30.244
I know.

34:30.985 --> 34:32.782
And I have been so mad at you.

34:33.920 --> 34:37.550
But then I tried to put myself
in your position...

34:38.059 --> 34:41.426
...so that I could understand
why you would do this to me...

34:41.596 --> 34:46.056
...and to Stefan,
because he's been such a friend to you.

34:50.103 --> 34:51.799
Who did she threaten?

34:52.806 --> 34:53.967
Matt.

34:55.309 --> 34:57.470
She threatened Matt.

34:59.514 --> 35:01.072
And I'm so scared of her, Elena.

35:01.249 --> 35:04.150
- I am so scared of her.
- And you should be.

35:04.752 --> 35:06.947
Caroline, we all should be.

35:08.156 --> 35:09.521
Why is she doing this?

35:12.260 --> 35:13.955
What does she want?

35:15.229 --> 35:17.163
That's the million-dollar question.

35:25.439 --> 35:27.202
<i>Hey, sheriff, it's Mason Lockwood.</i>

35:27.375 --> 35:30.003
I just wanna make sure
everything went okay today.

35:30.178 --> 35:33.306
I didn't see you later and...

35:34.348 --> 35:36.009
Give me a call, will you?

35:40.555 --> 35:41.681
Hey.

35:45.960 --> 35:47.860
I almost killed a girl today.

35:48.996 --> 35:51.157
- What?
- It was an accident.

35:51.332 --> 35:53.266
I was being stupid.

35:53.634 --> 35:55.761
She's okay though.

35:56.504 --> 36:00.998
But there I was, you know,
just for a moment...

36:01.175 --> 36:03.973
...for a split second, I hoped she'd die.

36:04.779 --> 36:08.647
Look, whatever this is inside me,
I don't want any part of it.

36:08.816 --> 36:12.013
I don't ever wanna feel that way again.
I won't.

36:12.687 --> 36:14.018
I can't.

36:17.859 --> 36:19.520
I know.

36:34.542 --> 36:35.566
Thank you.

36:36.677 --> 36:38.508
Yeah.

36:56.631 --> 36:58.258
Caroline's sleeping on the couch.

36:58.699 --> 37:00.963
I heard. And you?

37:02.637 --> 37:04.434
I'm going home.

37:09.977 --> 37:12.070
What you did for Caroline's mom...

37:14.215 --> 37:17.275
...that's the Damon
who was my friend.

37:23.991 --> 37:25.720
Hey.

37:26.260 --> 37:30.162
Stefan didn't drink the people blood,
if you were curious.

37:30.998 --> 37:33.125
But he needs to.

37:33.734 --> 37:35.395
And deep down, you know that.

37:51.419 --> 37:53.444
You can come in.

37:54.488 --> 37:56.581
Do you really think
that you can control it?

38:00.261 --> 38:01.888
I don't know.

38:04.532 --> 38:06.500
But if I don't try...

38:09.136 --> 38:11.104
So a little bit every day?

38:13.474 --> 38:17.171
Yeah, just a few drops of blood
in my system.

38:18.012 --> 38:20.139
I think it's worth trying.

38:23.284 --> 38:24.979
So do I.

38:26.687 --> 38:28.848
But I don't want you to do it alone.

38:35.696 --> 38:36.958
What are you doing?

38:47.742 --> 38:49.471
It's you and me, Stefan.

38:52.713 --> 38:54.237
Always.

40:01.248 --> 40:03.113
I've been waiting.

40:07.455 --> 40:08.820
Mason?

40:10.524 --> 40:13.152
- What happened?
- Jimmy attacked me.

40:13.561 --> 40:14.653
What? Why?

40:15.162 --> 40:18.393
- He said that I hit on Marla.
- Why would he think that?

40:23.671 --> 40:25.298
He's dead.

40:26.907 --> 40:28.772
I killed him.

40:29.477 --> 40:31.968
Everything's gonna be okay.

40:36.951 --> 40:37.975
Ah...

40:38.152 --> 40:40.177
What was that stunt today
that you pulled...

40:40.354 --> 40:42.185
...with Damon and Stefan Salvatore?

40:42.990 --> 40:46.983
- Thought you'd be happy about that.
- I told you to stay away from them.

40:47.194 --> 40:48.320
Why do you even care?

40:48.829 --> 40:52.287
I don't want you to get distracted.
I need you to find the moonstone.

40:56.670 --> 40:57.762
You got it.

40:58.672 --> 41:00.401
I got it.
