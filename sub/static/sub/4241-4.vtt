WEBVTT

00:02.114 --> 00:03.365
<i>So here's
what you missed on Glee:</i>

00:03.432 --> 00:04.599
<i>Tina dumped Artie
for Mike Chang.</i>

00:07.436 --> 00:08.987
<i>in the shower.
And we'd like to talk
to you about Glee Club.</i>

00:09.071 --> 00:09.871
<i>Finn thought Kurt was trying
to look at him in the shower,</i>

00:09.939 --> 00:11.373
<i>so he called him a name</i>

00:11.440 --> 00:13.074
<i>which totally got him
chewed out by Kurt's dad.</i>

00:13.125 --> 00:14.493
<i>Maybe everyone should
just start taking baths.</i>

00:14.577 --> 00:15.377
<i>And that's what you missed
on Glee!</i>

00:18.047 --> 00:18.914
(bell ringing)

00:20.500 --> 00:23.552
All right, let's, uh,
let's gather round.

00:23.619 --> 00:25.887
Sorry I'm late, guys.

00:25.955 --> 00:27.121
I was with Principal Figgins.

00:28.674 --> 00:31.259
Bad news, guys.
Puckerman's in Juvvie.

00:31.327 --> 00:33.228
It really was just
a matter of time.

00:33.295 --> 00:34.312
What did he do?

00:34.397 --> 00:35.797
He drove his mom's Volvo through

00:35.865 --> 00:37.065
the front of
a convenience store,

00:37.133 --> 00:38.800
and drove off with the ATM.

00:38.851 --> 00:40.151
(laughter)

00:40.236 --> 00:41.486
A-A-And when is he getting out?

00:41.571 --> 00:42.771
Unknown.

00:42.822 --> 00:44.239
He might be the mbest
person on this planet,

00:44.306 --> 00:45.106
and that's
coming from me.

00:45.157 --> 00:47.225
Guys! Let's have some sympathy.

00:47.293 --> 00:48.860
For a guy who put his
needs before the team's?

00:48.945 --> 00:50.946
We need his voice, and his
bad-boy stage presence.

00:50.997 --> 00:53.665
We can't look at this
as, as a crisis.

00:53.749 --> 00:55.033
It's an opportunity.

00:55.117 --> 00:56.484
For what?

00:56.552 --> 00:57.986
Further embarrassment
and humiliation?

00:58.037 --> 01:02.090
For welcoming our new member...
Sam Evans!

01:02.157 --> 01:04.426
There he is.
How's it going?

01:04.492 --> 01:05.994
Hey, everybody.
I'm Sam.

01:06.045 --> 01:08.930
Sam... I am.

01:08.998 --> 01:10.465
And I don't like
green eggs and ham.

01:10.516 --> 01:13.501
Oh, wow.
He has no game.

01:13.553 --> 01:15.220
Okay! This is
gonna be great.

01:15.304 --> 01:16.688
You're not going to
regret joining, Sam.

01:16.772 --> 01:17.722
Oh, good.

01:17.807 --> 01:19.007
Sam, you sit right here.

01:19.058 --> 01:20.358
WILL: All right!
Question for the group.

01:20.443 --> 01:22.861
What's a duet?

01:22.945 --> 01:24.613
A blanket.

01:24.680 --> 01:27.365
A duet is when two voices
join to become one.

01:27.450 --> 01:31.185
WILL: Great duets are like
a great marriage.

01:31.237 --> 01:32.487
The singers complement
each other,

01:32.538 --> 01:33.855
push each other to be better.

01:33.906 --> 01:35.240
Now, some people...

01:35.324 --> 01:37.459
Psst! He's on team gay.

01:37.526 --> 01:39.127
No straight boy
dyes his hair

01:39.194 --> 01:41.580
to look like Linda
Evangelista circa 1993.

01:41.647 --> 01:43.999
You're crazy,
circa 2010.

01:44.050 --> 01:45.199
WILL:
And that is what

01:45.251 --> 01:46.885
duets are all about.

01:46.969 --> 01:50.038
So, this week I want you
to pair up and sing a duet.

01:50.089 --> 01:52.140
And since you guys all
seemed to love our little

01:52.207 --> 01:56.711
"Defying Gravity" diva-off,
I'm making this a competition.

01:56.762 --> 01:58.313
What's the winner get?

01:58.381 --> 02:00.381
Dinner for two, on me...

02:00.433 --> 02:02.400
at Breadstix.

02:02.485 --> 02:03.885
(all gasping)
Breadstix!

02:03.936 --> 02:08.740
(everyone
chattering excitedly)

02:08.824 --> 02:10.108
Who you gonna
sing with, Kurt?

02:15.948 --> 02:17.616

02:18.684 --> 02:20.368
(bell ringing)

02:22.455 --> 02:24.255
Hi. I'm Kurt Hummel.

02:24.340 --> 02:25.707
Hey.

02:25.758 --> 02:27.759
I just wanted to personally
welcome you to the glee club.

02:27.843 --> 02:30.045
Thanks.

02:30.096 --> 02:31.579
Just tell me.

02:33.749 --> 02:35.850
Look... maybe at
your old school,

02:35.918 --> 02:37.469
you could get away
with the whole

02:37.553 --> 02:39.354
"I just stayed in the sun
all summer" excuse,

02:39.421 --> 02:41.690
but I have three gifts:
my voice,

02:41.757 --> 02:43.642
my ability to spot trends
in men's fashion,

02:43.726 --> 02:46.695
and my ability to know when
it comes from a bottle.

02:46.762 --> 02:48.330
I don't dye my hair, dude.

02:48.397 --> 02:49.230
Yes, you do.

02:49.281 --> 02:50.264
But it's just between friends.

02:50.316 --> 02:51.800
That's not natural.

02:51.867 --> 02:53.268
I'm gonna... go...

02:53.336 --> 02:55.987
'cause you're kinda
freaking me out.

02:56.072 --> 02:57.455
Wait, wait.

02:57.540 --> 02:58.990
Maybe my instincts
were a little off.

02:59.075 --> 03:00.608
Let me make it up to you.

03:00.660 --> 03:02.377
Team up with me for
the duet competition.

03:02.444 --> 03:03.795
Listen, unless you
team up with Rachel,

03:03.879 --> 03:05.463
I am your best
bet at winning.

03:05.548 --> 03:07.966
Aren't duets supposed to be
between, like, a girl and a guy?

03:08.050 --> 03:10.418
Well, Gene Kelly and Donald
O'Connor would protest.

03:10.469 --> 03:11.553
"Make'em Laugh"?

03:11.620 --> 03:12.721
Sorry.

03:12.788 --> 03:14.589
<i>Singin' in the Rain.
1952.</i>

03:14.640 --> 03:16.391
Nothing. Okay, maybe
you are straight.

03:16.458 --> 03:18.309
What?
Nothing. Listen, rent it.

03:18.394 --> 03:20.011
and then look up the menu
for Breadstix online,

03:20.096 --> 03:21.513
and call me, because
we are gonna win this.

03:21.597 --> 03:23.982

03:32.141 --> 03:34.609
BRITTANY:
I love your sweet lady kisses.

03:34.660 --> 03:36.244
Mm-hmm.

03:36.311 --> 03:38.863
It's a nice break from
all that scissoring.

03:38.948 --> 03:40.865
We should do a
duet together.

03:40.950 --> 03:43.702
We should sing Melissa
Ethridge's "Come To My Window."

03:43.786 --> 03:45.120
First of all?

03:45.171 --> 03:46.554
There's a lot of
talking going on,

03:46.622 --> 03:48.006
and I wants ta
get my mack on.

03:48.090 --> 03:49.958
Well... I don't know,
I just... I think we just...

03:50.009 --> 03:51.492
Okay, second of all?

03:51.544 --> 03:53.962
I'm not making out with you
because I'm in love with you

03:54.013 --> 03:55.847
and want to sing about
making lady babies.

03:55.915 --> 03:58.016
I'm only here because Puck's
been in the slammer

03:58.100 --> 03:59.701
for about 12 hours now,
and I'm like a lizard.

03:59.769 --> 04:02.554
I need something warm beneath
me, or I can't digest my food.

04:02.638 --> 04:05.407
But who are you going
to sing a duet with?

04:05.474 --> 04:06.941
(bell ringing)

04:07.009 --> 04:08.676
Why would I want to do
a duet with you?

04:08.728 --> 04:09.611
We can't stand each other.

04:09.678 --> 04:10.729
Look, Wheezy, I realize

04:10.813 --> 04:12.346
I've tried to punch you
a couple times,

04:12.398 --> 04:13.615
and sometimes, when
you're not looking,

04:13.682 --> 04:15.366
I puweird things
in your food.

04:15.451 --> 04:17.067
But it's a new year,
and you and I

04:17.153 --> 04:18.319
are the best singers
at this school.

04:18.370 --> 04:19.571
I don't get what
the big deal is,

04:19.654 --> 04:21.322
it's just a free trip
to Breadstix.

04:21.373 --> 04:24.793
<i>Um, I'm sorry, have you
been to Breadstix?</i>

04:24.860 --> 04:28.663
They are legally forbidden to
stop bringing you breadsticks.

04:28.714 --> 04:30.531
One time I brought
a wheelbarrow,

04:30.583 --> 04:31.633
and when the mager tried

04:31.700 --> 04:33.068
to stop me from
filling it up,

04:33.135 --> 04:34.319
I calleded the corporae
office and got her fired.

04:34.403 --> 04:36.638
(sighs)

04:36.705 --> 04:39.474
Well, I guess our voices
do sorta go together.

04:39.525 --> 04:40.909
Mm-hmm, that's right, girl!

04:40.976 --> 04:42.961
So if we do a duet
together, we will be

04:43.028 --> 04:45.363
the undisputed top
bitches at this school.

04:47.616 --> 04:49.467
(bell ringing)

04:49.535 --> 04:50.752
You can't do this to him.

04:50.819 --> 04:51.652
You're over-reacting.

04:51.704 --> 04:53.088
If he sings with you,

04:53.155 --> 04:54.506
you're painting a
bull's-eye on his back.

04:54.590 --> 04:56.708
Once again, your closeted
homophobia seeps to the surface

04:56.792 --> 04:58.843
like the contents of
a cracked cesspool.

04:58.928 --> 05:00.361
Don't give me that.

05:00.429 --> 05:02.797
Look, I know I shouldn't have
used that word in your basement,

05:02.848 --> 05:04.332
but it's not like
you were innocent.

05:04.383 --> 05:06.217
I really like you, Kurt.

05:06.302 --> 05:07.835
But the fact
of the matter is,

05:07.887 --> 05:09.804
the way you were all
over me last year?

05:09.855 --> 05:12.524
if I did that to a girl, she'd
take out a restraining order.

05:12.608 --> 05:15.510
You have issues with me
being gay, I get it.

05:15.561 --> 05:16.728
No, actually, I don't.

05:16.812 --> 05:18.179
I have issues with
the fact that

05:18.230 --> 05:23.368
you don't understand
that no means no.

05:23.452 --> 05:24.819
I just want to
sing with him.

05:26.789 --> 05:29.824
Then you don't give
a damn about any of us.

05:29.875 --> 05:33.361
If he sings with you,
I guarantee, within a week,

05:33.412 --> 05:35.330
he'll take so much crap,

05:35.381 --> 05:37.165
he'll have to quit Glee Club.

05:38.584 --> 05:39.751
Your call, dude.

05:42.838 --> 05:48.376

07:32.581 --> 07:34.832
Wow. Don't be sad.

07:34.917 --> 07:37.001
I mean, Breadstix has these
vegan meatballs, they're...

07:37.086 --> 07:38.086
they're okay.

07:38.153 --> 07:39.671
I'm not really a nice person.

07:41.440 --> 07:42.924
I'm selfish.

07:47.162 --> 07:48.880
The fact is, is I'm
only really generous

07:48.964 --> 07:50.548
if there's something
in it for me.

07:50.633 --> 07:52.467
Yeah, but I
still like you.

07:52.518 --> 07:56.638
But you, you're so...
kind, a-and open.

07:58.841 --> 08:01.676
Well, it's made me
want to be a better person.

08:05.514 --> 08:06.898
We have to throw
the competition.

08:06.982 --> 08:08.750
I love Breadstix.

08:08.817 --> 08:11.018
No, i-i-if we wanna
win at Nationals,

08:11.070 --> 08:12.987
then Sam has to
win this contest.

08:13.055 --> 08:15.990
Okay? He has to feel
like he belongs and,

08:16.041 --> 08:17.325
and the team has
to believe in him.

08:17.376 --> 08:20.795
Wow, Rachel, I never
seen you like this.

08:20.863 --> 08:22.063
I'm kind of impressed.

08:22.131 --> 08:24.865
Well, like I said...

08:24.917 --> 08:26.584
you inspired me.

08:30.706 --> 08:32.056
But technically,
you're doing this

08:32.140 --> 08:33.775
because it'll help
us win Nationals,

08:33.842 --> 08:36.059
which means there's
something in it for you,

08:36.145 --> 08:38.563
so it doesn't really count
as you doing something nice.

08:38.630 --> 08:40.515
Okay, so I'm just gonna
ignore what you just said

08:40.566 --> 08:42.734
repeat what I said before:
we just have to find a way

08:42.818 --> 08:44.152
for me to lose
a singing competition

08:44.219 --> 08:45.570
so that the new kid
sticks around.

08:45.654 --> 08:46.604
Right.

08:50.658 --> 08:52.826
I don't want to do it.
We're duet partners--
you have to sing!

08:52.877 --> 08:54.261
<i>I don't even know
if I can sing.</i>

08:54.328 --> 08:56.496
Everyo knows I'm here
to do one thing: dance.

08:56.547 --> 08:58.298
You sing and I'll
dance around you;
you'll be fine.
No, no.

08:58.349 --> 09:00.017
We're singing together.

09:00.101 --> 09:01.501
We are gonna win that
dinner at Breadstix,

09:01.552 --> 09:03.020
and then we can finally
have a normal night out.

09:04.222 --> 09:05.722
Normal? What do you mean?

09:05.807 --> 09:07.357
We went out last night.

09:07.442 --> 09:09.309
For dim sum.
With your mom.

09:09.360 --> 09:12.062
All we ever do is get
dim sum with your mom!

09:12.146 --> 09:13.230
Here we go.

09:15.516 --> 09:16.667
Hi.

09:16.734 --> 09:19.303
So, I just want
you to know

09:19.370 --> 09:20.570
I'm really into you.

09:22.457 --> 09:23.657
Okay.

09:23.725 --> 09:25.075
Sorry, I'm...

09:25.159 --> 09:26.843
just a little confused.

09:26.928 --> 09:29.346
You've never even made
eye contact with me.

09:29.414 --> 09:32.299
I know. For a while
I thought you were a robot.

09:32.350 --> 09:34.134
<i>TINA:
I'm not saying that</i>

09:34.185 --> 09:35.335
steamed pork knuckles
aren't delicious.

09:35.403 --> 09:37.054
I'm just saying
that at Breadstix

09:37.138 --> 09:38.689
they have bottomless
salad bowls,

09:38.773 --> 09:41.308
they refill your salad
until you leave or pass out.

09:41.359 --> 09:43.143
You can get salad
at dim sum.

09:43.194 --> 09:44.511
My mom got salad
last night.

09:44.562 --> 09:45.862
There were chicken feet in it.

09:45.947 --> 09:48.365
It was a chicken
feet salad.

09:48.449 --> 09:50.283
All I want is
a normal salad

09:50.351 --> 09:52.352
that doesn't have
chicken feet in it!

09:52.403 --> 09:54.287
So, let me get this straight.

09:54.355 --> 09:57.074
You want to be my girlfriend

09:57.158 --> 10:00.877
because... you like
the idea of...

10:02.213 --> 10:03.830
...wheeling me around?

10:03.881 --> 10:07.134
I just really want
to get you in a stroller.

10:07.201 --> 10:08.385
<i>MIKE:
You're not listening to me.</i>

10:08.453 --> 10:09.970
You don't care
about my needs!

10:10.037 --> 10:11.221
Shh!

10:11.305 --> 10:13.140
We're fighting a lot.

10:14.709 --> 10:16.710
We should go to
Asian couples therapy.

10:16.761 --> 10:19.980
Why does the couples therapy
have to be Asian?

10:20.048 --> 10:22.215
So, I get to tell
everybody that we're dating?

10:22.266 --> 10:23.216
Yes.

10:23.267 --> 10:25.218
And I get a duet partner.

10:33.778 --> 10:35.395
I don't see the big deal.

10:35.446 --> 10:37.247
He e-mailed me, like,
60 MP3's of him singing,

10:37.331 --> 10:39.166
and I thought it was Faith Hill.

10:39.233 --> 10:40.784
The kid's good.

10:40.868 --> 10:43.069
Look, this isn't about
how good Kurt is.

10:45.506 --> 10:47.340
Being in Glee Club is like...

10:47.408 --> 10:49.426
it's like walking down
the double yellow lines

10:49.510 --> 10:50.727
of a highway.

10:50.795 --> 10:52.846
If you get just
a little off course

10:52.913 --> 10:54.264
you're gonna get crushed.

10:54.348 --> 10:55.766
I got to be honest.

10:55.850 --> 10:57.801
You're kind of confusing
my head right now.

10:57.885 --> 10:58.802
I mean,
do you remember

10:58.886 --> 11:00.187
what you said when

11:00.254 --> 11:01.722
you talked me
into joining Glee Club?

11:01.773 --> 11:02.773
(bell ringing)

11:02.857 --> 11:04.191
Nationals are
in New York City.

11:04.258 --> 11:06.276
Can you imagine
at it's going to be like

11:06.360 --> 11:08.278
coming home
with that first-place trophy?

11:08.362 --> 11:11.815
Most of the kids in this town
have never even seen the ocean.

11:11.899 --> 11:14.367
We'll be gods.

11:14.435 --> 11:16.603
I joined up
because I'm new here

11:16.654 --> 11:18.538
and you said
it would make me popular,

11:18.606 --> 11:20.440
and now you're telling me that
it's going to get me killed.

11:20.491 --> 11:22.492
Well, eventually you're going
get popular from it,

11:22.577 --> 11:23.994
believe me,
but until then,

11:24.078 --> 11:26.747
you got to lay low
a little bit,

11:26.798 --> 11:28.114
a-and singing a duet
with another dude

11:28.166 --> 11:29.583
is not laying low.

11:29.634 --> 11:32.385
I didn't realize you had
a problem with gay dudes.

11:32.453 --> 11:34.387
Look, I don't have
a problem with gay dudes.

11:34.455 --> 11:36.173
Everyone else does,
and we're living

11:36.257 --> 11:38.675
in their world,
and in their world,

11:38.760 --> 11:41.344
you singing a duet with Kurt
is a death sentence.

11:41.429 --> 11:43.597
(sighs)

11:43.648 --> 11:45.015
Well,

11:45.099 --> 11:46.483
I gave him my word.

11:48.352 --> 11:50.487
In my world, that's that.

11:54.242 --> 11:56.359
Boom!

11:56.444 --> 11:58.995
Welcome to Glee Club,
lady lips.

11:59.080 --> 12:00.914
(laughter)

12:06.120 --> 12:08.922
The blueberry flavor
is the worst,

12:08.989 --> 12:11.258
especially if it gets
down your pants.

12:11.325 --> 12:13.159
<i>I looked like a creature
out of Avatar down there</i>

12:13.211 --> 12:14.377
when I got Slushied.

12:15.763 --> 12:18.799
<i>I saw Avatar,
like, six times.</i>

12:20.268 --> 12:22.219
Oh.

12:22.303 --> 12:25.105
Anyway,
you'll get used to it.

12:26.274 --> 12:27.390
You're the head cheerleader.

12:27.475 --> 12:28.692
Why do you even bother?

12:28.776 --> 12:30.527
I mean, you don't
need Glee Club.

12:31.779 --> 12:36.316
I like to sing...
and the fact is

12:36.367 --> 12:37.868
those guys were
pretty cool to me

12:37.952 --> 12:39.536
last year
when I wasn't on top.

12:39.620 --> 12:41.037
What's the point
of being popular

12:41.105 --> 12:43.323
when you can't do
what you want?

12:43.374 --> 12:45.492
<i>Lor manari.</i>

12:46.761 --> 12:49.746
It means you have
pretty eyes.

12:49.831 --> 12:52.833
<i>It's Nav'i... the
Avatar language.</i>

12:54.502 --> 12:55.952
<i>Lor manari.</i>

12:58.139 --> 13:00.891
First course is served.

13:00.975 --> 13:02.592
Heart-healthy
vegan carrot soup

13:02.677 --> 13:04.144
with whole grain
croutons,

13:04.211 --> 13:06.129
and you'd better eat
all of it.

13:06.197 --> 13:08.715
Do you have any idea how hard it
is to find saffron in this town?

13:08.766 --> 13:11.685
All right, let me eat
this at the table.

13:11.736 --> 13:13.436
You could make a
plaster cast of my ass

13:13.521 --> 13:14.654
with the cushions
from this couch.

13:14.722 --> 13:15.989
Absolutely not.

13:16.056 --> 13:18.191
I am in charge
of your care from now on.

13:18.242 --> 13:19.993
You had a serious
arrhythmia, Dad.

13:20.060 --> 13:22.612
The doctors say you need to
rest until your stress test.

13:22.697 --> 13:25.532
You're my stress test.

13:25.583 --> 13:28.201
Guess this means
I can't get salt?

13:30.404 --> 13:32.339
(sighs)

13:32.406 --> 13:33.740
Chin up.

13:33.791 --> 13:34.875
What's up?

13:34.926 --> 13:36.843
How's school?

13:36.911 --> 13:38.044
(sighs)

13:38.095 --> 13:40.463
It's fine, I guess.

13:42.917 --> 13:46.386
There's this new kid Sam
in Glee Club.

13:46.437 --> 13:48.922
He and I are singing
a duet together.

13:48.973 --> 13:50.140
Is that a problem?

13:50.224 --> 13:53.977
Finn practically
begged me not to.

13:54.061 --> 13:56.112
He said it'd ruin
Sam's reputation.

13:56.180 --> 13:59.733
Well, this kid
Sam, uh...

13:59.784 --> 14:01.735
you know, does he, he
play for your team?

14:01.802 --> 14:03.153
Undetermined.

14:03.237 --> 14:04.404
Oh.

14:04.472 --> 14:06.656
Maybe Finn has a point.

14:06.741 --> 14:08.742
You're siding with him

14:08.793 --> 14:10.276
after what he called me
in our basement?

14:10.328 --> 14:13.747
I was talking to Carole, and you
weren't totally honest with me.

14:13.814 --> 14:16.166
She told me that you
had a crush on Finn

14:16.250 --> 14:17.834
and you weren't
afraid to show it.

14:17.919 --> 14:18.802
Is this true?

14:18.886 --> 14:20.453
So a gay guy
can't be friendly

14:20.504 --> 14:22.288
to a straight guy
without it being predatory?

14:22.340 --> 14:23.473
You got to understand

14:23.541 --> 14:24.641
that most guys don't
know how to deal

14:24.725 --> 14:26.676
with unwanted advances.

14:26.761 --> 14:28.228
So you're saying I shouldn't
sing with this Sam guy

14:28.295 --> 14:30.964
because it might upset
a couple homophobes?

14:31.015 --> 14:32.966
I thought you said no one
pushes the Hummels around.

14:33.017 --> 14:34.000
(sighs)

14:34.068 --> 14:35.001
No one does.

14:35.069 --> 14:36.252
I-I'm, I'm not saying that.

14:36.320 --> 14:37.537
I-I'm, I'm saying

14:37.605 --> 14:41.191
that maybe it's
you who's pushing

14:41.258 --> 14:43.276
this kid Sam around,
trying to take advantage of him

14:43.327 --> 14:44.861
because you're interested
in him.

14:44.929 --> 14:47.664
Dad, you have no idea
what it's like.

14:47.732 --> 14:51.201
I am the only openly gay kid
at school, in this town.

14:51.285 --> 14:53.086
I mean, why can't I walk
hand in hand

14:53.153 --> 14:54.921
down the hall
with a person that I like?

14:54.989 --> 14:56.740
Why can't I slow-dance
at my prom?

14:57.959 --> 15:00.343
Come here.

15:05.132 --> 15:06.967
You think I don't want
those things for you?

15:07.018 --> 15:08.051
I do.

15:09.337 --> 15:11.805
You know, until
you find somebody

15:11.856 --> 15:15.909
as open and as
brave as you,

15:15.977 --> 15:19.913
you're just going to have to
get used to going it alone.

You know why?

To Breadstix.

18:01.408 --> 18:02.625
(chuckles)

18:02.710 --> 18:03.660
Yes.
You hear that, guys?

18:03.744 --> 18:06.563
You have your work
cut out for you.

18:15.134 --> 18:16.418
Don't worry,

18:16.485 --> 18:18.303
<i>I'm not going to go
all Shawshank on you.</i>

18:18.354 --> 18:19.854
This is kind of weird.

18:19.939 --> 18:23.108
Guys usually don't talk
to each other in here.

18:23.159 --> 18:24.475
Well, this can't wait.

18:24.527 --> 18:25.994
I'm setting you free.

18:26.078 --> 18:28.863
You can do your duet
with someone else in Glee,

18:28.948 --> 18:32.317
someone that the world deems
more appropriate.

18:32.385 --> 18:33.835
Did I do something
to offend you?

18:33.919 --> 18:35.787
No, no, I...

18:35.838 --> 18:38.873
It's not you, it's me.

18:38.941 --> 18:40.375
You've been honorable,
actually,

18:40.443 --> 18:43.595
and I wish you
the best,

18:43.662 --> 18:45.663
but I've realized that I need
to sing with someone

18:45.715 --> 18:47.632
that matches my passion
and talent level.

18:47.683 --> 18:48.850
Who's that?

18:48.918 --> 18:50.802
You know, they make
special shampoo

18:50.853 --> 18:52.387
for color-treated hair.

18:54.106 --> 18:55.307
I don't dye my hair.

18:55.358 --> 18:56.524
Uh-huh.

18:56.609 --> 18:57.692
This is a disaster.

18:57.777 --> 18:58.693
Could you stop pacing?

18:58.778 --> 18:59.961
It's stressing me out.

19:00.029 --> 19:02.180
It's just,
being the "it couple"

19:02.231 --> 19:03.815
is so much harder
than I thought.

19:03.866 --> 19:06.951
I-I am so stumped
at how to lose this thing.

19:07.019 --> 19:08.787
Wait, I got it.

19:08.854 --> 19:10.655
<i>You remember we saw
Grease and it was good,</i>

19:10.706 --> 19:12.407
<i>and then we saw Grease 2,
and I fell asleep,</i>

19:12.491 --> 19:13.825
but you said
the difference

19:13.893 --> 19:16.361
was that the songs were bad.
Were bad.

19:16.412 --> 19:17.495
Yeah

19:17.546 --> 19:19.647
If we want to lose,

19:19.715 --> 19:22.267
we have to do a song that's bad.

19:22.318 --> 19:24.903
Not just a bad song,
an offensive song.

19:24.970 --> 19:26.154
(claps)

19:26.238 --> 19:27.922
<i>Yes!
Artie.
Mm-hmm.</i>

19:27.990 --> 19:29.640
Can we talk?
Yeah.

19:29.692 --> 19:30.992
I want us to be
duet partners.

19:31.077 --> 19:32.110
Really?

19:32.161 --> 19:33.778
We sing really well
together.

19:33.829 --> 19:35.780
I just thought
if we won,

19:35.831 --> 19:38.850
we could share a nice,
free dinner together

19:38.918 --> 19:40.118
as friends.

19:40.186 --> 19:42.337
We haven't
really talked.

19:42.421 --> 19:44.089
Well, Tina, as
rich as I find it

19:44.156 --> 19:45.340
that you've come
crawling back,

19:45.424 --> 19:46.941
I'll have
you know that

19:47.009 --> 19:48.793
not only do I have
a duet partner

19:48.844 --> 19:49.961
but that our
working relationship

19:50.012 --> 19:51.963
has blossomed into romance.

19:55.768 --> 19:58.136
If you'll excuse me.

19:58.187 --> 20:00.304
WILL:
Okay, guys, so...

20:00.356 --> 20:02.574
who is up first today?

20:02.641 --> 20:03.575
Mr. Shue, if I may.

20:03.642 --> 20:04.526
You may.

20:07.530 --> 20:10.432
As many of you know,
I had a duet partner,

20:10.499 --> 20:12.150
but due to sensitivities
I'd rather not get into

20:12.218 --> 20:15.036
at the moment, I have
dissolved the partnership.

20:15.104 --> 20:18.039
Okay, so who are you going
to sing a duet with?

20:18.124 --> 20:21.426
Only the most talented member
of the glee club-- myself.

20:23.396 --> 20:26.431
When you're different,
when you're special,

20:26.498 --> 20:28.850
sometimes you have
to get used to being alone.

20:28.918 --> 20:30.685
I've asked a few members
of the glee club

20:30.753 --> 20:32.170
as well as some Cheerios!
to help me out.

20:32.238 --> 20:34.055
How can you do a duet
by yourself?

20:34.140 --> 20:35.723
That's like vocal masturbation
or something.

20:35.808 --> 20:36.808
(scattered snickering)

20:36.859 --> 20:38.226
I will be
doing a number

20:38.310 --> 20:41.913
<i>from the seminal classic
movie Victor/Victoria.</i>

20:41.981 --> 20:43.815
It's a show about embracing
both the male

20:43.866 --> 20:44.749
and the female sides.

20:44.817 --> 20:46.851
Watch and learn, Santana.

20:46.919 --> 20:48.019
Hit it.

Yeah!

23:30.515 --> 23:33.568
(applause, indistinct shouts)

23:33.652 --> 23:35.286
I love astronomy.

23:35.354 --> 23:36.854
Something about all that space

23:36.905 --> 23:39.190
makes my problems
seem kind of small.

23:39.241 --> 23:41.376
That one's Venus.

23:41.460 --> 23:43.244
Planet of love.

23:43.329 --> 23:46.030
It's actually Mars,
planet of war.

23:48.217 --> 23:50.168
<i>Which one are we on?</i>

23:50.219 --> 23:51.702
Earth.

23:51.754 --> 23:53.504
So why don't you
come back to it

23:53.555 --> 23:54.839
and talk to me
about duets.

23:54.890 --> 23:58.259
Tell me why I should
be singing with you.

23:58.327 --> 24:00.061
Okay.

24:00.145 --> 24:01.896
Well, I want to start off
with the choreography.

24:04.216 --> 24:08.069
Singing will be easy,
so I'll start playing...

24:08.153 --> 24:09.804
(chords strumming)

24:09.872 --> 24:12.240
All right, now
get behind me.

24:12.324 --> 24:13.724
(quietly): Get behind me.

24:13.776 --> 24:17.028
(continues strumming)

24:18.730 --> 24:20.365
Good.

24:20.416 --> 24:22.116
Now grab my hips.

24:22.201 --> 24:24.402
And start swaying.

24:27.756 --> 24:30.541
All right, now,
here's the cool part.

24:30.592 --> 24:32.427
(stops strumming)
Give me your hand.

24:34.079 --> 24:35.930
Do you know how to play?

24:36.015 --> 24:38.966
(whispers):
No.

24:39.051 --> 24:41.052
All right, it's easy.

24:41.103 --> 24:43.104
Just put that
finger there.

24:43.188 --> 24:44.856
Just like that.

24:44.923 --> 24:47.408
(strumming quietly)

24:47.476 --> 24:49.410
Now do it fast
back and forth.

24:49.478 --> 24:51.446
(chord changes)

24:51.530 --> 24:52.980
There you go.

24:53.065 --> 24:54.682
(chord changes)

24:54.750 --> 24:57.769
(slowly stops strumming)

25:04.109 --> 25:05.626
No. No, I can't do this.

25:05.711 --> 25:07.745
Th year is about me.

25:07.813 --> 25:10.581
And don't say that I'm selfish,
because you have no idea

25:10.632 --> 25:12.216
how much I've given.
I wasn't... I wasn't gonna...

25:12.284 --> 25:14.335
I've been down this path before;
I know this feeling.

25:14.420 --> 25:16.387
(anxious sigh)
Like, I need you.

25:16.455 --> 25:19.090
Duets don't work for me,
and I don't need you.

25:19.141 --> 25:21.843
What I need is to find a way
to keep Santana off my heels.

25:21.927 --> 25:24.429
I'm... I'm sorry...
What I need is to find a
way to torture Rachel.

25:24.480 --> 25:27.682
And I need to start
learning to ignore people.

25:27.766 --> 25:29.934
And I'm sorry,
I shouldn't...

25:29.985 --> 25:30.968
I shouldn't have tried that.

25:31.019 --> 25:33.071
I'm sorry.

25:33.138 --> 25:36.641
I made a mistake,
and, um...

25:36.709 --> 25:38.776
I don't want to
sing with you.

25:40.863 --> 25:42.280
(bell rings)

25:44.080 --> 25:45.814
I don't think I could do this.

25:45.865 --> 25:47.699
It's the perfect song
for this very situation.

25:47.767 --> 25:49.751
Whenever you're ready, guys.

25:49.819 --> 25:51.920
SANTANA: Yeah, hurry up;
I needs to get myself

25:51.988 --> 25:53.038
to Breadstix.

25:53.122 --> 25:54.656
Don't count on it.

25:54.707 --> 25:56.742

<i>Now, that
is a duet!</i>

27:42.081 --> 27:44.016
Thank you, Tina,
for introducing us

27:44.100 --> 27:46.268
to the amazing voice
of Mike Chang!

27:47.654 --> 27:48.470
That was good.

27:52.575 --> 27:54.109
(groans)

27:54.160 --> 27:58.146
You tried to kiss her?
Major Glee party foul, dude.

27:58.197 --> 28:00.699
Look, I know I shouldn't have.

28:00.783 --> 28:03.618
She was just sending
me these vibes.

28:03.670 --> 28:05.037
And those eyes.

28:06.990 --> 28:09.207
Hey, Quinn, can we talk?

28:09.292 --> 28:12.044
What do you want
to talk about?
About Sam. I-I heard

28:12.128 --> 28:14.713
that you backed out of
doing the duet with him.

28:14.797 --> 28:16.348
Maybe it's for the best
she backed out.

28:16.432 --> 28:18.467
I mean, if that Puckerman kid
ever gets out of jail,

28:18.518 --> 28:20.052
he's gonna
beat my ass.

28:20.136 --> 28:21.219
I'm sure you still have
feelings for her, too.

28:21.304 --> 28:23.221
No, no, no way.
I'm with Rachel now.

28:23.306 --> 28:25.307
I mean, she's a lot
shorter than Quinn

28:25.358 --> 28:28.026
and she talks a lot,
but I'm in love with her.

28:28.111 --> 28:30.112
Look, th-this isn't
about dating, dude.

28:30.179 --> 28:31.563
This is about you
singing with Quinn

28:31.647 --> 28:33.281
to raise your musical rep
in the group.

28:33.349 --> 28:36.985
Look, I understand
that your reputation
is important to you, but...

28:37.036 --> 28:39.571
wouldn't you want
to do whatever it
takes to be on top

28:39.655 --> 28:41.689
of the proverbial pyramid in
every aspect of your life?

28:41.741 --> 28:43.575
Singing with Sam
won't change that.

28:43.659 --> 28:45.077
Oh, but winning
the competition will.

28:45.161 --> 28:47.529
And partnering with Sam is
really your only shot at it.

28:50.216 --> 28:52.167
What's your angle?

28:52.218 --> 28:53.635
Angle?
What's your
angle?

28:53.703 --> 28:55.036
Me winning means you losing,

28:55.088 --> 28:56.972
and you'll do whatever
it takes to make sure

28:57.039 --> 28:59.141
that doesn't happen,
so what is in it for you?

28:59.208 --> 29:00.592
Look, I agree.

29:00.660 --> 29:02.644
Okay? You're probably not
gonna beat Finn and I,

29:02.711 --> 29:04.379
but I just thought that,

29:04.430 --> 29:06.465
as the team captain, it
would be good for the team

29:06.532 --> 29:09.935
to have some healthy competition
for second place.

29:10.002 --> 29:12.387
<i>FINN:
Look, I'm not saying you're
gonna win, but I'm just saying</i>

29:12.455 --> 29:13.905
that, you know,
even coming in second

29:13.990 --> 29:17.993
would go a long way with
the rest of the team.

29:18.060 --> 29:19.361
(bell rings)
Hey.

29:19.412 --> 29:21.580
Listen, I was totally
out of line with you.

29:21.664 --> 29:23.448
I promise it won't
happen again,

29:23.533 --> 29:26.368
though you might have
to wear sunglasses
whenever we're together.

29:26.419 --> 29:29.771
Good. Because we're gonna
have to spend a lot of
time together practicing

29:29.839 --> 29:32.140
if we're gonna win
that dinner at Breadstix.

35:35.171 --> 35:38.123
But I really wanted
to go with you.

for my voice.

That's the only reason
you had sex with me.

35:53.790 --> 35:55.090
I have it on good authority.

35:55.141 --> 35:56.508
She's using you
for your voice.

35:56.593 --> 35:58.093
That's the only reason
she had sex with you.

35:58.144 --> 35:59.311
Wait. How did you know that?

35:59.395 --> 36:01.563
Hi. Excuse me.
Do you know Brittany?

36:01.631 --> 36:02.815
Cheerios! Brittany?

36:02.882 --> 36:04.850
Mm-hmm.
Yeah. We had sex.

36:04.934 --> 36:07.519
Hmm. Look, I don't
mean to be a bitch--

36:07.604 --> 36:09.238
well, yeah, actually, I do--

36:09.305 --> 36:11.607
but the only thing
that you can give Brittany

36:11.658 --> 36:13.642
that she can't get
from someone else

36:13.693 --> 36:16.578
is ser choice parking.

36:16.646 --> 36:19.381
I know that sex
don't mean anything to you,

36:19.449 --> 36:22.785
but did you ever think
how much it means to me?

36:22.852 --> 36:25.254
After my accident,

36:25.321 --> 36:28.674
we didn't know if I'd ever
be able even to do that.

36:28.758 --> 36:30.759
And when I found out
that I could,

36:30.827 --> 36:32.594
it seemed like
some kind of miracle,

36:32.662 --> 36:35.030
and you just walked
all over that.

36:35.098 --> 36:37.549
You're not my
partner anymore.

36:37.617 --> 36:40.619
I told Mr. Shue I'm pulling out
of the duet competition.

36:40.687 --> 36:42.387
Artie, I didn't know. I'm...

36:42.472 --> 36:44.439
I'm so sorry.

36:53.967 --> 36:57.285
Okay, since Artie
and Brittany have dropped

36:57.337 --> 37:00.222
out of the race, I guess it's
time to take it to a vote.

37:15.972 --> 37:18.524
Well, even though
it looks like

37:18.608 --> 37:20.592
just about everyone voted
for themselves--

37:20.660 --> 37:21.977
even those who didn't compete--

37:22.028 --> 37:23.328
we do have a winner.

37:26.833 --> 37:28.717
And the winner is...

37:32.255 --> 37:33.222
...by two votes...

37:34.924 --> 37:35.674
...Sam and Quinn.

37:35.758 --> 37:37.309
What? What?

37:37.393 --> 37:38.844
Screw that!
I want my stix!

37:38.928 --> 37:40.262
Ooh, let it go.
Let go. Let it go!

37:40.313 --> 37:41.847
Unbelievable.

37:41.931 --> 37:43.849
It was mine! No, I don't
know how this happened.

37:43.933 --> 37:45.300
Son.

37:45.351 --> 37:46.768
Unbelievable.

37:48.638 --> 37:50.022
(quietly):
This is so not a date.

37:50.106 --> 37:52.441
We did it, babe.

37:52.492 --> 37:54.109
(bell ringing)

37:54.177 --> 37:57.079
Hey, I had something
I wanted to talk to you about.

37:57.146 --> 37:58.647
Oh, please not
another pregnancy.

37:58.698 --> 38:01.650
I think that you and I are
a little bit more similar

38:01.701 --> 38:03.652
than you think.

38:03.703 --> 38:05.954
That's a terrible thing to say.

38:07.423 --> 38:09.708
I know you're lonely.

38:09.792 --> 38:13.445
I can't even imagine
how hard it must be

38:13.513 --> 38:16.281
to have feelings in high
school that you can't act on

38:16.349 --> 38:20.802
for fear of being humiliated,
ridiculed or worse.

38:20.870 --> 38:23.021
We're going to win
Nationals this year,

38:23.089 --> 38:25.607
and you know how
we're ing to do that?

38:25.675 --> 38:27.225
Because we have you.

38:27.310 --> 38:30.145
That's true.

38:30.213 --> 38:32.314
That's 12 people
who love you just

38:32.382 --> 38:35.701
for being exactly
the way that you are.

38:35.768 --> 38:38.687
Look, I'm know
you're lonely, but...

38:38.738 --> 38:40.572
you're not alone.

38:42.742 --> 38:44.376
So, I was wondering

38:44.460 --> 38:47.696
if you would maybe want
to sing a duet with me?

38:47.747 --> 38:50.532
I think you'll be really
happy with my song selection.

38:50.583 --> 38:52.801
It's sort of everything
that both you and I love.

38:52.868 --> 38:54.920
But the, uh, duet
competition is over.

38:55.004 --> 38:56.555
I know. I just...

38:56.639 --> 38:59.057
I thought this one
could be for me and you.

38:59.142 --> 39:01.643
(bell ringing)

39:01.711 --> 39:04.012
You know, I hear they don't even
make these fresh.

39:04.063 --> 39:05.814
They fly them in frozen
from some factory

39:05.881 --> 39:07.332
in the Dominican Republic.

39:07.400 --> 39:10.686
I once caught some pretty sweet
waves down in the Dominican.

39:10.737 --> 39:14.323
Hey, hey, hey.

39:14.390 --> 39:15.557
Uh-uh.

39:15.608 --> 39:17.058
Come on.

39:17.110 --> 39:19.060
It's my Matthew McConaughey
impression-- come on.

39:19.112 --> 39:20.862
Does that work on the girls
where you're from?

39:20.913 --> 39:24.499
The impressions,
the bad jokes,

39:24.567 --> 39:26.818
the Nav'i?

39:26.886 --> 39:28.420
Uh, I don't know.
I don't know.

39:28.488 --> 39:29.988
I went to an all-boys
boarding school.

39:30.056 --> 39:32.090
Makes sense.

39:33.292 --> 39:35.327
It must be hard.

39:35.395 --> 39:38.463
I think if I went through
what you went through last year,

39:38.548 --> 39:41.133
I would have transferred
to a school on the moon

39:41.217 --> 39:42.718
or something,
out of embarrassment.

39:42.769 --> 39:45.137
Okay, that-that didn't
come out right. I mean,

39:45.221 --> 39:48.290
you're really brave
to come back like you have.

39:48.358 --> 39:50.108
I don't judge you or anything.

39:50.193 --> 39:53.378
I know what it's like
to have a...

39:53.446 --> 39:55.647
secret that you're ashamed of.

39:55.732 --> 39:59.651
Oh, holy crap. So you...

39:59.736 --> 40:01.203
So you are gay?

40:01.270 --> 40:02.821
(laughs):
What?

40:02.905 --> 40:04.773
No. Not at all.

40:04.824 --> 40:06.742
When I found out
I was moving here,

40:06.793 --> 40:08.660
I wanted to seem cool, you know?

40:08.728 --> 40:11.380
<i>Figured if I looked
like Swayze in Point Break,</i>

40:11.447 --> 40:13.665
people might think
I was a surfer or something.

40:13.750 --> 40:15.067
(laughs)

40:15.134 --> 40:16.518
I didn't think it
through very clearly.

40:16.586 --> 40:21.673
So... I put lemon juice
in my hair.

40:21.758 --> 40:24.426
I would have gotten away
with it, if it hadn't been

40:24.477 --> 40:26.011
for Kurt and his sixth sense.

40:31.150 --> 40:33.118
I think it looks cute.

40:33.186 --> 40:35.203
Really?

40:35.271 --> 40:37.022
(laughs)

40:37.090 --> 40:39.024
(sighs)

40:42.745 --> 40:44.112
What are you doing?

40:44.163 --> 40:45.263
We're not using that.

40:45.331 --> 40:46.581
You're paying.

40:46.649 --> 40:47.866
Why?

40:47.934 --> 40:51.703
Because a gentleman always
pays on the first date.
