00:05.780 --> 00:07.170
How divine.

00:08.230 --> 00:11.360
It’s so cold, Agni. What is this?

00:11.870 --> 00:15.760
It is snow; something which falls in England during the winter, my Prince.

00:15.760 --> 00:16.570
Snow?

00:19.050 --> 00:20.820
England, huh?

00:20.820 --> 00:22.160
It’s exquisite.

01:56.800 --> 02:01.800
His Butler, A Freeloader

01:56.800 --> 02:01.800
<font size="50">His Butler,</font>

01:57.450 --> 02:01.800
<font size="50"><font color="#2f281c">A</font></font>

01:58.070 --> 02:01.800
<font size="50"><font color="#2f281c">Freeloader</font></font>

02:02.490 --> 02:06.850
“This fellow is the child of craziness and laziness.

02:06.850 --> 02:12.610
England is the blasphemous country that has taken all, and forced upon us, in arrogant ways, its rotten culture.

02:12.610 --> 02:16.650
Retribution should befall the fools of the country that the hellcat rules.”

02:17.330 --> 02:19.610
This is the twentieth case!

02:19.610 --> 02:22.950
Have you still not apprehended the culprit, Aberlain?

02:22.950 --> 02:24.890
I—I am profoundly sorry!

02:25.470 --> 02:30.420
Failing to catch Jack the Ripper, doing nothing but putting feathers in that brat’s cap…

02:30.900 --> 02:31.760
That brat?

02:31.760 --> 02:34.800
Do you mean Ciel Phantomhive?

02:35.710 --> 02:40.860
I cannot help but feel that he bears some immense burden

02:41.410 --> 02:42.970
even though he is still but a child.

02:44.350 --> 02:46.040
A child?

02:46.040 --> 02:49.090
A series of incidents targeting those who have returned from India?

02:49.090 --> 02:50.860
Master Ciel!

02:51.230 --> 02:53.730
It seems there haven’t been any fatalities yet.

02:55.320 --> 02:57.890
Crazy and lazy children, huh?

02:57.890 --> 03:01.280
The culprit’s choice of words is very accurate.

03:01.280 --> 03:07.240
I also think this country would be considerably better off without the nouveau riche who come back from India.

03:07.240 --> 03:09.710
At any rate, this mark is…

03:10.060 --> 03:13.890
They’re making fun of us Englishmen and Her Majesty the Queen!

03:14.330 --> 03:16.490
The culprit has to be an Indian!

03:16.490 --> 03:20.160
Ah, so that’s why I was called out.

03:20.860 --> 03:26.430
The vast majority of Indians who have been smuggled into the country are situated in the East End underworld society.

03:26.430 --> 03:31.350
Scotland Yard still has no idea of the exact number or their precise locations, does it?

03:33.370 --> 03:38.640
There is no way we can sit idly by while the royal family is slandered.

03:38.640 --> 03:40.130
Let’s go, Sebastian.

03:40.130 --> 03:40.530
Yes.

03:48.510 --> 03:52.460
This is supposed to be the area where most of the Indians are hiding out.

03:54.500 --> 03:55.330
Ouch!

03:55.330 --> 03:59.050
Oh, so painful! I think one of my ribs has fractured!

03:59.050 --> 04:01.390
Damn it, I might die!

04:01.390 --> 04:02.500
Hey, what’s up?

04:02.500 --> 04:03.700
This is terrible!

04:03.700 --> 04:05.010
You should get compensation to pay for a doctor!

04:05.470 --> 04:07.620
You’d better leave us everything you have.

04:08.010 --> 04:11.240
We seem to have been surrounded by rather loutish thugs.

04:11.240 --> 04:13.280
Young Master, what are your orders?

04:13.280 --> 04:15.170
Take care of this quickly.

04:15.170 --> 04:16.430
Understood.

04:16.430 --> 04:21.100
All the Indians around here have a grudge against you English.

04:24.390 --> 04:26.140
Are you all right?

04:26.140 --> 04:27.010
Yeah.

04:27.530 --> 04:28.780
You bastard.

04:29.240 --> 04:33.380
After dragging us all the way here, you just threw us out like junk.

04:33.380 --> 04:36.730
You raped and looted our country.

04:36.730 --> 04:39.500
Now it’s your turn to taste the humiliation of being pillaged!

04:39.500 --> 04:40.750
Wait.

04:40.750 --> 04:45.880
We are looking for someone. Have you seen this person?

04:49.080 --> 04:51.060
What do you want, you bastard? Don’t interrupt me!

04:51.480 --> 04:53.540
Are you having a duel or something?

04:55.110 --> 04:57.830
Oh, he has a khansama with him.

04:57.830 --> 04:59.830
Are you one of the English nobles?

04:59.830 --> 05:01.070
And if I am?

05:01.440 --> 05:05.260
In that case, I shall side with my countrymen in this quarrel.

05:05.840 --> 05:06.530
Agni.

05:06.530 --> 05:07.070
Yes?

05:07.290 --> 05:08.780
Defeat them.

05:08.780 --> 05:09.990
Jo ajna.

05:10.640 --> 05:12.790
My right hand, blessed by God,

05:13.710 --> 05:15.620
shall be wielded for my master.

05:30.770 --> 05:31.390
He’s fast.

05:34.640 --> 05:37.510
I’ve hit your vital points several times now.

05:37.510 --> 05:40.250
You should already be paralysed.

05:40.250 --> 05:41.060
How can you still move?

05:41.690 --> 05:44.870
Hey! We were just passing through here.

05:44.870 --> 05:48.990
Are Indians barbarians who discriminate with no distinction?

05:48.990 --> 05:50.170
What?

05:50.170 --> 05:53.620
You people! Did you attack that little one over there for no reason?

05:55.460 --> 05:57.160
That is not right!

05:57.160 --> 05:59.480
This time, my countrymen are at fault.

05:59.480 --> 06:01.670
Agni, take the little one’s side.

06:02.520 --> 06:03.130
Understood.

06:07.530 --> 06:09.340
It’s taken care of, Prince Soma.

06:09.340 --> 06:10.110
Good.

06:11.430 --> 06:15.250
Well then, I was in the middle of looking for someone, so I had better get going.

06:15.250 --> 06:15.890
See you.

06:17.350 --> 06:20.230
English roads are too complicated.

06:20.230 --> 06:22.090
Let’s head left next.

06:23.880 --> 06:25.930
I’m completely drained.

06:26.430 --> 06:29.840
The culprit may have been one of those Indian people.

06:30.240 --> 06:32.760
Let us await Master Randall’s report.

06:33.120 --> 06:34.410
Young Master.

06:34.410 --> 06:35.880
Welcome home!

06:35.880 --> 06:36.580
Indeed!

06:36.580 --> 06:41.420
If I keep getting called out to London for all these trivial incidents, there’ll be no end to it.

06:41.760 --> 06:44.910
Ah! Earl, you really did come.

06:44.910 --> 06:46.320
You’re always so unannounced!

06:46.320 --> 06:49.470
I keep telling you, if you’re going to visit, at least send a letter or something first.

06:50.780 --> 06:52.220
Have you said that?

06:52.730 --> 06:56.340
Since we have a guest now, I shall prepare some tea.

06:57.330 --> 06:58.570
Fine.

06:58.570 --> 07:00.640
I’d prefer an English Chai blend.

07:00.890 --> 07:02.400
Fine.

07:06.380 --> 07:10.620
Ah, I met them around the corner. They said they wanted to meet the earl.

07:10.620 --> 07:11.990
Why are you here?

07:12.390 --> 07:16.580
Why? We got acquainted earlier, did we not?

07:16.580 --> 07:18.480
Acquainted?

07:18.480 --> 07:20.390
And also, we saved you.

07:20.390 --> 07:21.250
Sav…

07:21.250 --> 07:21.960
In what way?

07:22.440 --> 07:25.960
In India, hosting for those to whom you are indebted is common sense.

07:26.720 --> 07:30.650
Is it the English way to throw such people out under the cold sky?

07:32.380 --> 07:34.260
Who are you anyway?

07:34.780 --> 07:35.720
Me?

07:36.120 --> 07:37.680
I am a prince.

07:38.050 --> 07:39.310
A prince?

07:39.780 --> 07:46.600
This personage is the Bengal Kingdom’s prince, the 26th Successor, Prince Soma Asman Cadart.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.780
I’ll be imposing on you for a while, Little One.

07:49.180 --> 07:51.680
Wow! A prince!

07:51.690 --> 07:53.320
A… A prince!

07:53.320 --> 07:56.240
This is the first time I’ve seen a real prince in the flesh!

07:56.240 --> 07:58.700
I consent. You may come closer.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.230
What is your kingdom like?

08:02.230 --> 08:06.290
It is a holy country that receives the blessings of the Goddess Kali and the Ganges river.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.880
So, you brought your servants with you this time?

08:09.880 --> 08:13.180
Yes. We have a guard dog to protect the manor while we’re away now.

08:14.080 --> 08:15.890
Well, that must be a relief.

08:18.270 --> 08:21.990
Sebastian, keep an eye on them.

08:21.990 --> 08:22.680
Understood.

08:26.150 --> 08:28.710
Master Ciel, it is time to wake up.

08:29.640 --> 08:31.940
“Master Ciel”?

08:32.510 --> 08:34.530
Namaste, Master Ciel.

08:34.530 --> 08:36.990
Wh—Why are you in my bedroom?

08:37.419 --> 08:40.470
We’re going out, Little One. Show us around.

08:40.470 --> 08:41.970
Why should I have to?

08:41.970 --> 08:45.570
And I have a proper name. It’s Ciel, not Little One.

08:45.570 --> 08:48.730
Then, Ciel, I ask that you be our guide.

08:48.730 --> 08:49.340
Come.

08:49.340 --> 08:50.420
Sorry to intrude,

08:50.970 --> 08:57.460
but the young master has studies and work duties to attend to today.

08:59.420 --> 09:03.600
While we’re in London, I shall fill in as your tutor.

09:06.480 --> 09:08.650
Bach’s Chaconne?

09:08.650 --> 09:11.070
There’s no way I can play a melody as complex as…

09:11.380 --> 09:13.610
While we’re here, I make the rules.

09:13.880 --> 09:16.780
Do you have a problem with my teaching methods?

09:26.270 --> 09:28.210
See? That’s wonderful.

09:36.510 --> 09:38.480
What on Earth?

09:41.190 --> 09:45.910
It seems that they’re praying, but that’s a rather fantastic idol, isn’t it?

09:45.910 --> 09:49.400
All I can see is a statue of a woman carrying a head

09:50.030 --> 09:55.940
with a necklace of heads around her neck, dancing on the belly of a man.

09:56.280 --> 10:00.750
She is one of the Hindu gods we worship, the Goddess Kali.

10:00.750 --> 10:01.990
Indian gods, huh?

10:02.450 --> 10:06.580
Kali is the wife of Shiva and a goddess of power.

10:06.980 --> 10:11.710
In far distant times, a certain demon recklessly challenged her to a fight.

10:12.560 --> 10:15.690
Of course, the Goddess Kali won.

10:15.690 --> 10:19.080
However, after that, unable to quell her destructive urges,

10:19.080 --> 10:21.390
she went on a rampage of death and destruction.

10:21.950 --> 10:24.170
In a bid to defend the Earth,

10:24.170 --> 10:28.230
her husband, the God Shiva, lay down at her feet.

10:29.820 --> 10:32.350
Having stepped on her husband with her unclean feet,

10:32.350 --> 10:36.480
the Goddess Kali returned to her senses and the Earth once again became peaceful.

10:37.330 --> 10:41.480
Kali is a great goddess who defeated a demon after a mighty battle.

10:41.860 --> 10:45.200
As proof of that, she has the demon’s head in her grasp.

10:45.740 --> 10:46.860
So he says.

10:46.860 --> 10:49.260
To think there was someone as strong as that…

10:49.700 --> 10:52.710
I will have to be careful if I ever go to India.

10:52.710 --> 10:56.170
Well then, our prayers are concluded, so let’s go out.

10:56.420 --> 10:59.380
As I said, I’m busy!

10:59.810 --> 11:03.340
Hey, when are you going to be finished?

11:03.340 --> 11:07.850
Hey, what are you doing anyway?

11:07.850 --> 11:09.640
You’ll distract us. Be quiet!

11:09.960 --> 11:12.060
English people are short-tempered, aren’t they?

11:13.810 --> 11:15.380
Enough! I get it!

11:15.380 --> 11:18.280
If you want my attention so badly, then I’ll be your opponent.

11:19.830 --> 11:22.240
So, if I win against you, you’ll come out with us?

11:22.870 --> 11:23.870
If you can.

11:24.460 --> 11:25.740
Good luck.

11:28.510 --> 11:29.580
Well then, begin!

11:31.920 --> 11:32.790
I’ve got you!

11:34.530 --> 11:35.340
It bent?

11:35.810 --> 11:38.710
There’s no benefit to hitting the foot with a foil.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.300
That’s unfair! I don’t know the rules!

11:42.300 --> 11:43.600
A match is a match!

11:43.600 --> 11:45.510
It’s your fault for not knowing!

11:46.000 --> 11:47.140
My Prince, watch out!

11:54.420 --> 11:55.610
M—Master Ciel!

11:56.270 --> 11:57.760
I’m so sorry.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.930
When I thought that His Highness was going to lose, my body moved of its own accord.

12:02.190 --> 12:04.910
Agni, you protected me well!

12:04.910 --> 12:06.510
I give you my praise!

12:06.510 --> 12:09.470
Agni is my khansama and belongs to me.

12:09.470 --> 12:10.910
Therefore, the win was mine.

12:11.140 --> 12:12.750
Th—That’s ridiculous.

12:12.750 --> 12:13.870
My, my.

12:14.200 --> 12:18.590
Looks like you will have to take your master’s revenge, Mr. Butler.

12:20.490 --> 12:21.720
Good grief.

12:22.190 --> 12:24.970
This happened because you teased an amateur who doesn’t know the rules.

12:26.090 --> 12:26.970
Nonetheless,

12:27.540 --> 12:34.540
as a butler of the Phantomhives, now that my master has been injured, I cannot merely sit back and watch.

12:35.070 --> 12:37.610
All else aside, we’re over ten minutes behind schedule.

12:37.610 --> 12:40.070
So, that’s what you’re really irritated about.

12:40.330 --> 12:41.700
How interesting.

12:41.700 --> 12:43.890
Fine. I will allow a duel.

12:43.890 --> 12:47.870
Agni, in the name of the Goddess Kali, do not lose!

12:49.120 --> 12:52.000
Sebastian, this is an order! Shut that brat up!

12:57.680 --> 12:59.120
Jo ajna.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.150
Yes, my Lord.

13:54.690 --> 13:57.390
Oh, my. The foils snapped.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.490
So, the match is a draw, huh?

13:59.870 --> 14:02.230
Ciel’s khansama is pretty good, too!

14:02.230 --> 14:06.210
A draw? His opponent was Sebastian!

14:07.380 --> 14:10.270
Agni is the best fighter in my castle!

14:10.270 --> 14:13.320
This is the first time I’ve seen anyone fight on a par with him!

14:13.740 --> 14:15.970
He went toe to toe with a demon.

14:19.550 --> 14:23.500
Sebastian, just what is that man?

14:23.500 --> 14:24.710
He’s not another one of those…

14:24.710 --> 14:26.470
I’m a butler to <i>die </i> for!

14:26.470 --> 14:29.930
No, he is definitely a <i>human </i> to die for.

14:29.930 --> 14:33.350
I see, but to have that much power…

14:33.780 --> 14:39.810
Indeed. Hanging people would have been an easy task for him… 

14:40.460 --> 14:43.880
All right! Today, I’ll use all my skill and cook—

14:43.880 --> 14:48.740
I’ll make the preparations. You just remain calm and stay put.

14:49.060 --> 14:53.000
What the… I was going to make my special dish today; the—

14:53.000 --> 14:57.640
Mr. Sebastian, I was wondering if there was anything I could do to help?

14:58.110 --> 15:00.560
It is all in hand. You should relax.

15:01.290 --> 15:05.460
Four hands are better than two. Please let me know if there is anything I can do.

15:05.700 --> 15:11.680
Well then, might I ask you to help with preparing the gooseberry sauce and cottage pie for tonight’s main dish?

15:12.060 --> 15:12.760
Of course.

15:13.220 --> 15:16.430
Hey! How come you give him a task, but don’t let me, the chef…

15:16.800 --> 15:17.970
Hey! Are you listening?

15:17.970 --> 15:20.100
Ah, I’m busy. So busy.

15:28.870 --> 15:31.200
Chef? Mr. Chef?

15:32.480 --> 15:35.190
Ch—Chef? You mean me?

15:35.190 --> 15:35.920
Yes.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.080
Ch…ef!

15:38.890 --> 15:41.720
I am not all that accustomed to English cooking. 

15:42.180 --> 15:43.420
May I ask for your assistance?

15:43.420 --> 15:46.950
Sure! Leave it to me!

15:50.630 --> 15:52.930
What’s for dinner tonight?

15:53.320 --> 15:55.430
Young man, you came just at the right time!

15:55.950 --> 15:58.010
Can you help us make dinner for tonight?

15:58.320 --> 16:00.160
Oh, me?

16:00.160 --> 16:05.560
But I’m strong and clumsy, so Sebastian said I wasn’t to touch any of the kitchenware.

16:05.960 --> 16:08.420
If you have strength, that’s a wonderful thing!

16:08.420 --> 16:12.780
We’re supposed to strain this potato after crushing it, but it’s quite a demanding task!

16:13.230 --> 16:15.660
I should be able to do that!

16:15.660 --> 16:17.740
I want to! Please let me!

16:23.750 --> 16:24.520
Watch out!

16:26.830 --> 16:29.280
Are all right, Miss Maid?

16:29.280 --> 16:31.020
Y—Yes.

16:31.560 --> 16:35.430
When taking plates down from high places, it is best to move them one at a time.

16:35.870 --> 16:37.890
Y—Yes!

16:38.500 --> 16:40.340
How are things proceeding, Mr. Agni?

16:48.380 --> 16:51.320
Thanks to everyone’s hard work, it looks like it’ll be delicious!

16:55.390 --> 16:59.080
You’re quite amazing to have got that lot to help you.

16:59.440 --> 17:02.680
Everyone is born with their own talent.

17:02.680 --> 17:06.109
They have a path and duty laid out for them by the gods.

17:06.109 --> 17:10.849
We children of the gods abide by that and do what we can.

17:10.849 --> 17:13.210
You are a most well-rounded individual, aren’t you, Mr. Agni?

17:13.920 --> 17:14.800
Not at all.

17:15.290 --> 17:19.970
Until I met the prince, I was a hopeless fool.

17:20.569 --> 17:23.520
I will be forever in his debt.

17:24.339 --> 17:29.560
I injured those around me, strayed from the gods and accumulated many sins.

17:29.960 --> 17:34.060
Finally, my day of judgement came.

17:36.380 --> 17:38.530
Without leaving any attachment to this world, I would…

17:38.800 --> 17:42.520
Hey, you, they say you’re a wild man as strong as a beast!

17:42.520 --> 17:43.490
Sounds interesting!

17:51.110 --> 17:53.680
The person you were before today is now dead.

17:53.680 --> 17:56.650
You will be reincarnated with a new name and life.

17:57.080 --> 17:59.870
To me, who had not even believed in the gods,

17:59.870 --> 18:01.640
who had thrown everything away…

18:01.920 --> 18:03.840
Listen, Agni.

18:04.870 --> 18:06.600
A god appeared!

18:07.750 --> 18:14.380
Indeed, that day, I saw the holy light of God within the prince!

18:14.720 --> 18:16.570
Mr. Agni, the pot is boiling over.

18:17.150 --> 18:20.030
The prince is both my king and god.

18:20.030 --> 18:26.350
Therefore I will use this new life to protect the one who gave it to me,

18:26.790 --> 18:30.230
and grant as many of his wishes as I can.

18:30.230 --> 18:33.960
Well, the real gods are all good-for-nothings anyway…

18:34.680 --> 18:35.550
Did you say something?

18:35.890 --> 18:38.120
No. Nothing.

18:43.610 --> 18:45.870
How long do you two intend to stay for?

18:45.870 --> 18:47.750
Once we’ve taken care of our business, we will leave.

18:47.750 --> 18:50.520
That’s right. You said you were looking for someone, right?

18:50.690 --> 18:53.040
And why are you staying here as well?

18:53.040 --> 18:54.480
Really, I wonder.

18:54.870 --> 18:56.930
I’m looking for a woman.

18:57.460 --> 19:01.360
Her name is Meena. She was a servant at my castle.

19:01.360 --> 19:04.030
Sebastian, would you be able to look for her with that?

19:05.210 --> 19:07.500
Even for me, it would be rather…

19:08.120 --> 19:09.080
I will try my best.

19:09.080 --> 19:11.790
So, why is that woman in England?

19:12.260 --> 19:16.740
Meena was my personal attendant, and like a wet nurse to me.

19:17.200 --> 19:19.990
I’ve been with her for as long as I can remember.

19:19.990 --> 19:23.940
My father and mother both paid me no heed,

19:24.300 --> 19:25.790
leaving me alone in the castle all the time,

19:26.240 --> 19:29.670
but Meena was always by my side.

19:29.670 --> 19:34.060
However, there was an English nobleman who had his eye on her,

19:34.060 --> 19:37.730
and he took her to England while I was away from the palace.

19:37.730 --> 19:42.070
In other words, you came to England to get a woman back?

19:42.070 --> 19:45.200
That’s right. I’ll definitely get her back, and then we’ll go home together.

19:45.200 --> 19:47.790
It’s an extravagant trip for just one servant.

19:47.790 --> 19:49.370
It’s not extravagant!

19:50.650 --> 19:54.320
Do you understand my despair at having Meena taken away from me?

19:54.320 --> 19:55.570
Do you know how much I—

19:55.570 --> 19:56.850
I don’t.

19:57.540 --> 20:05.680
I have no idea, nor desire to know, of the despair that can be caused by something as trivial as that.

20:10.470 --> 20:13.870
There are things that you cannot get back no matter how much you struggle.

20:13.870 --> 20:16.190
There is also despair that you cannot escape.

20:18.370 --> 20:21.070
You may not understand that, though.

20:23.930 --> 20:27.390
Even so, I have still had enough

20:27.390 --> 20:29.490
of being alone in that palace.

20:30.790 --> 20:33.750
No matter how you struggle, you can’t get it back.

20:44.470 --> 20:47.600
Even you should know the rules of Old Maid, right?

20:50.430 --> 20:55.050
My tasks for today are all finished. I’ll play with you until I retire for the night.

20:57.340 --> 20:58.190
Ciel.

20:58.570 --> 21:03.650
It’s not for your sake or anything. I’m playing with you because I’m bored.

21:07.480 --> 21:09.120
Sorry, but I have things to do.

21:09.360 --> 21:10.040
What?

21:10.880 --> 21:12.930
Unlike you, I’m busy.

21:13.270 --> 21:14.750
Agni, we’re going out.

21:14.800 --> 21:15.750
Yes.

21:21.950 --> 21:25.870
If you don’t go to sleep early, you won’t grow, Little Ciel.

21:25.870 --> 21:26.680
See you.

21:31.880 --> 21:35.140
Ah, you’re there. You know, Earl…

21:36.290 --> 21:37.270
What?

21:37.990 --> 21:39.930
No luck again today, huh?

21:39.930 --> 21:42.110
We’ll search again tomorrow.

21:45.830 --> 21:47.070
So, they came back.

21:47.070 --> 21:50.320
Frankly, they’re surpassingly suspicious, those two.

21:50.320 --> 21:51.970
That’s true, but still,

21:51.970 --> 21:54.540
I can’t see how those incidents would benefit them.

21:55.040 --> 21:59.750
Judging from their behaviour, they don’t seem to hold a grudge against the colonial rule. 

22:00.070 --> 22:05.700
Anyway, if they really were the culprits, do you think they would just dump themselves in front of me so carefreely?

22:05.700 --> 22:08.250
That’s almost like saying, “I’m suspicious!”

22:08.250 --> 22:12.720
That’s true. In that case, they probably really are just searching for someone.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.680
It’s still too early to conclude that.

22:22.090 --> 22:24.210
He’s on the move after all.

22:42.160 --> 22:45.040
Nothing I say comes out right.

22:45.040 --> 22:47.800
I can't love without a fight.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.550
No one ever knows my name.

22:50.550 --> 22:53.260
When I pray for sun, it rains.

22:53.260 --> 22:55.970
I'm so sick of wasting time,

22:55.970 --> 22:58.680
but nothing's moving in my mind.

22:58.680 --> 23:01.430
Inspiration can't be found.

23:01.430 --> 23:03.640
I get up and fall, but...

23:03.640 --> 23:06.440
I'm alive!

23:06.440 --> 23:08.770
I'm alive!

23:08.770 --> 23:09.690
Oh yeah!

23:09.690 --> 23:13.110
Between the good and bad is where you'll find me,

23:13.110 --> 23:14.610
reaching for Heaven!

23:14.610 --> 23:17.370
I will fight!

23:17.370 --> 23:19.620
And I'll sleep when I die!

23:19.620 --> 23:22.330
I live my life!

23:22.790 --> 23:25.540
I'm alive!

23:25.540 --> 23:27.880
I'm alive!

23:27.880 --> 23:29.120
Oh yeah!

23:29.120 --> 23:32.260
Between the good and bad is where you'll find me,

23:32.260 --> 23:33.800
reaching for Heaven!

23:33.800 --> 23:36.550
I will fight!

23:36.550 --> 23:38.760
And I'll sleep when I die!

23:38.760 --> 23:44.270
I live my hard life!

23:44.270 --> 23:50.770
I live my life! I'm alive!

23:58.430 --> 24:00.950
Mr. Agni’s unknown, hidden face.

24:00.310 --> 24:01.750
Deer?

24:01.750 --> 24:07.500
No matter what the reason, hiding things from your master makes you a failure as a butler.

24:08.530 --> 24:11.830
My face has neither a hidden nor a visible side.

24:12.470 --> 24:14.920
Shall I show you how how I really look?

24:15.770 --> 24:17.220
All right, look!

24:18.350 --> 24:20.180
Next time on Kuroshitsuji:

24:20.180 --> 24:26.630
<font size="50"><font color="#ffffff">His Butler, Extraordinary</font></font>

24:20.180 --> 24:26.630
<font size="35"><font color="#ffffff">Preview</font></font>

24:20.180 --> 24:22.630
His Butler, Extraordinary.

24:22.630 --> 24:24.970
After all, I am one hell of a butler.

24:26.630 --> 24:29.560
<font size="22" face="Californian FB">We shall await you next time…</font>
