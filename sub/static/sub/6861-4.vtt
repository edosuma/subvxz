WEBVTT

00:00.934 --> 00:02.235
Dr. Hart, my name
is Dr. Harley Wilkes.

00:02.235 --> 00:04.072
I'm from
BlueBell, Alabama.

00:04.072 --> 00:05.039
Harley Wilkes was your father.

00:05.039 --> 00:05.939
What?

00:05.939 --> 00:07.441
He left you his practice.

00:07.441 --> 00:09.043
Zoe, this is Lemon Breeland.

00:09.043 --> 00:10.078
George Tucker.

00:10.078 --> 00:11.079
You're the mayor?

00:11.079 --> 00:12.546
Lavon Hayes, the linebacker?

00:12.546 --> 00:14.548
You share a generator
withWade Kinsella.

00:14.548 --> 00:16.084
I don't want
you getting any ideas.

00:16.084 --> 00:17.118
(panting)

00:17.118 --> 00:18.452
(yells)
Notice how

00:18.452 --> 00:19.487
whenever I come around
there's always sparks?

00:19.487 --> 00:20.688
LAVON:
 If I do recall,

00:20.688 --> 00:23.057
we are
 at your engagement party.

00:23.057 --> 00:24.958
You know how difficult
this is for me.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.294
Difficult never stopped me.

00:26.294 --> 00:27.295
Who are you?
Didi.

00:27.295 --> 00:28.562
Your new receptionist.

00:28.562 --> 00:30.098
Would you like to go out
to dinner some time?

00:30.098 --> 00:31.299
DIDI:
 Well, I ought to feel welcome.

00:31.299 --> 00:33.901
Flowers from the mayor.
Mayor?

00:33.901 --> 00:36.504
I don't know or care what is
going on between you two, but...

00:36.504 --> 00:38.206
Lemon, I got business
to attend to.

00:43.010 --> 00:45.213
(children shouting happily)

00:47.014 --> 00:49.049
* *

00:49.049 --> 00:51.419
(laughter)

00:51.419 --> 00:52.620
(barking)

00:57.858 --> 00:59.393
(barking)

01:13.006 --> 01:15.109
Gross.

01:24.818 --> 01:27.355
I have a question.

01:27.355 --> 01:29.290
Why are you
half naked?
(laughs)

01:29.290 --> 01:31.759
More importantly,
why is the earth on fire?

01:31.759 --> 01:34.027
Oh. Lavon Hayes would
like to welcome you

01:34.027 --> 01:36.164
to your very first BlueBell

01:36.164 --> 01:37.565
heat wave,

01:37.565 --> 01:39.667
where hot and bothered
takes on a whole new meaning.

01:39.667 --> 01:43.304
Meaning?
People tend to go a little crazy
around here this time of year.

01:43.304 --> 01:45.773
Yeah, and get ready to
see half-naked people

01:45.773 --> 01:48.008
doing full-on crazy
things. Oh, yeah.

01:48.008 --> 01:49.277
I don't want to see that.

01:49.277 --> 01:50.911
I want to sit in the freezer.

01:50.911 --> 01:52.280
You better watch yourself, girl,

01:52.280 --> 01:54.415
'cause the fever hits everyone
eventually.

01:54.415 --> 01:56.417
Even New York
City doctor types.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.186
Yup, and pretty soon,

01:58.186 --> 02:01.455
your freaky deaky will
be on full display.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.324
I doubt it.
Trust me.

02:03.324 --> 02:04.558
It hits everyone.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.126
I hate to disappoint you, Lavon,

02:06.126 --> 02:08.127
but I don't have
freaky deaky in me.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.062
I'm not a freaky deaky
kind of person.

02:10.062 --> 02:11.299
Ambitious? You betcha.

02:11.299 --> 02:12.533
But I don't do crazy.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.902
Why not?
Since when did
breakfast become

02:14.902 --> 02:16.170
clothing optional?

02:16.170 --> 02:17.471
Since there's a heat wave, baby!

02:17.471 --> 02:18.972
Oh, give me some.
Uh-huh. Bam.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.474
LAVON (laughs):
Trust me.

02:20.474 --> 02:23.811
BlueBell gets a lot more
fun when it's 105 degrees out.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.879
And since Didi and I

02:25.879 --> 02:28.449
are going out on our
first date tomorrow night.

02:28.449 --> 02:29.850
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!

02:29.850 --> 02:31.185
Hit it!

02:31.185 --> 02:32.520
I don't understand
how you people

02:32.520 --> 02:33.721
are happy about this weather.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.656
My contacts
have literally melted

02:35.656 --> 02:37.124
onto my eyeballs.

02:37.124 --> 02:38.492
Heat wave's like a free pass
to do whatever you want.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.860
What's not to like?

02:39.860 --> 02:41.762
I'm assuming
that's a rhetorical question?

02:41.762 --> 02:43.631
I'm also assuming that you don't
know what rhetorical means.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.366
I think it means you haven't
answered the question.

02:45.366 --> 02:46.634
I know all about
free passes.

02:46.634 --> 02:49.337
See, it's like my mom
and champagne.

02:49.337 --> 02:50.504
When she drinks,

02:50.504 --> 02:52.105
she thinks
that nothing counts.

02:52.105 --> 02:53.474
My mom used to throw
these huge parties

02:53.474 --> 02:55.576
for her celebrity clients
at our house.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.711
So, the champagne would flow,
then, the next day,

02:57.711 --> 02:59.613
someone would be arrested,
someone would have

02:59.613 --> 03:02.115
lost their pants,
and my mom would be found

03:02.115 --> 03:03.417
passed out behind the couch

03:03.417 --> 03:05.085
with one
of her friend's husbands

03:05.085 --> 03:06.654
and a Calvin Klein
model.
Exactly.

03:06.654 --> 03:08.656
Your mom knew how
to enjoy a free pass.

03:08.656 --> 03:11.024
Yeah, so much
that she went on a Greek cruise,

03:11.024 --> 03:13.994
had sex with some guy,
and now I live in Alabama.

03:13.994 --> 03:15.229
Point is,

03:15.229 --> 03:16.664
I don't do crazy.

03:16.664 --> 03:19.367
I have seen crazy, and crazy
comes with consequences.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.469
There's no such thing
as a free pass.

03:21.469 --> 03:23.203
Mm-hmm. You'll see.

03:23.203 --> 03:27.908
Weather this hot, you cannot
fight your inhibitions, girl.

03:29.510 --> 03:32.346
You know, you could look
at this as an opportunity.

03:33.681 --> 03:36.517
What's the one thing you wanted
to do since you got here

03:36.517 --> 03:38.185
that you haven't done?

03:38.185 --> 03:40.288
Just go right ahead and do it.

03:40.288 --> 03:42.790
No judgments,
no inhibitions.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.258
Just do it.

03:45.092 --> 03:47.328
Know what I mean?

03:48.161 --> 03:50.298
Okay.

03:50.298 --> 03:52.900
Maybe... I do.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.302
Yeah?

03:54.302 --> 03:56.304
(laughs)

03:57.738 --> 03:59.573
Oh!

03:59.573 --> 04:01.775
(laughs)

04:01.775 --> 04:04.912
(laughs)

04:21.762 --> 04:24.097
(sighs)

04:24.097 --> 04:25.132
(sighs)

04:25.132 --> 04:26.634
Oh, my goodness!

04:26.634 --> 04:28.769
George, baby, why didn't you
tell me it was so late?

04:28.769 --> 04:30.338
I didn't know
I was supposed to.

04:30.338 --> 04:31.705
Baby, I can't dilly dally
in bed all day.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.273
I got a duck to prepare,
and your mama's

04:33.273 --> 04:35.476
recipe requires 24 hours of
marinating, and I haven't even

04:35.476 --> 04:37.378
de-seeded the chilies yet.

04:37.378 --> 04:38.612
So make something else.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.614
Baby, I can't just
make something else.

04:40.614 --> 04:41.982
Tomorrow's dinner
has to be perfect.

04:41.982 --> 04:44.084
Your parents only come into town
once a month,

04:44.084 --> 04:46.620
and that doesn't give me
nearly enough time with them.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.689
Really? 'Cause I feel
the exact opposite.

04:48.689 --> 04:49.890
George, I'm being serious.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.992
Don't you want your mama
to like me?

04:51.992 --> 04:53.160
She does like you.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.962
She finds me silly and
high-strung and you know it.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.430
She doesn't take me
serious, George,

04:56.430 --> 04:57.998
and we're getting married,

04:57.998 --> 05:00.801
and-and this dinner is a...
it's a symbol of our future.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.503
Pretty soon, we're gonna be
having Thanksgiving

05:02.503 --> 05:04.304
Mm-hmm.
and Christmas, and I need

05:04.304 --> 05:05.939
to show her my agreeable nature.

05:07.207 --> 05:09.042
(laughs)
What? I am very agreeable.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.478
Of course you are.

05:10.478 --> 05:12.480
Good. Now, try and get
home early from work tomorrow.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.014
The earlier we eat, the better.

05:14.014 --> 05:16.116
Otherwise, your dad's gonna
get started on the bourbon.

05:16.116 --> 05:17.250
We know what happens next.

05:17.250 --> 05:18.251
Football.

05:18.251 --> 05:19.353
Football.

05:19.353 --> 05:21.254
Right.

05:21.254 --> 05:23.591
Well, maybe you should talk
to Brick.

05:23.591 --> 05:27.661
Well, maybe you should talk
to your daddy.

05:29.196 --> 05:30.931
All right, okay.

05:30.931 --> 05:33.767
I will see about getting
home early tomorrow.

05:33.767 --> 05:37.671
But for now, that
duck can wait.

05:38.706 --> 05:39.840
(laughs)

05:39.840 --> 05:41.108
It is a heat wave.

05:41.108 --> 05:42.443
Mmm.

05:47.815 --> 05:49.249
Mosquito bites.

05:49.249 --> 05:51.419
I got 'em on my boat
last night.

05:51.419 --> 05:54.154
I'm assuming that they all
extend toward...

05:54.154 --> 05:55.355
My buttocks,
yes, ma'am.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.290
Do you need
to see 'em?
No, no.

05:57.290 --> 05:58.426
I'll take your word for it.

05:58.426 --> 05:59.893
It's just a little strange

05:59.893 --> 06:02.029
that it's only on your backside
and your right leg,

06:02.029 --> 06:03.296
and not on your front side

06:03.296 --> 06:05.365
or your left leg.
Well, it's not
that strange,

06:05.365 --> 06:06.834
considering the
position I was in.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.436
And what position would that be?

06:08.436 --> 06:10.971
Are you familiar with
the Kama Sutra at all?

06:10.971 --> 06:12.239
Addy?!
Uh-huh.

06:12.239 --> 06:13.441
Could you please get

06:13.441 --> 06:15.443
this young man
some calamine lotion?

06:15.443 --> 06:16.877
A bucket's worth?

06:16.877 --> 06:18.311
Come on, Fred.

06:18.311 --> 06:19.413
You little devil.

06:19.413 --> 06:21.014
That vase was
supposed to be mine.

06:21.014 --> 06:23.917
Mama changed her mind about the
vase when she gave you the car!

06:23.917 --> 06:24.852
Ladies, please.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.587
Well, I never
wanted the car!

06:26.587 --> 06:27.921
I wanted the vase,
and you know it!

06:27.921 --> 06:29.590
Well, you got the
car, so stuff it!

06:29.590 --> 06:31.459
What in the world
is all the fuss?
GEORGE:
Addy,

06:31.459 --> 06:33.060
you remember the Parker sisters,
right?

06:33.060 --> 06:34.462
Of course I do. Polly.

06:34.462 --> 06:35.829
Fiona. How are
you two ladies?

06:35.829 --> 06:37.531
I am bleeding,
thank you very much.

06:37.531 --> 06:39.567
My sister tried to kill
me with a desk clock.

06:39.567 --> 06:41.201
If I was trying to kill you,
you'd be dead.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.571
Oh, both of you, hush up. I'm
gonna take you in to see Brick,

06:43.571 --> 06:44.905
try to sort this out.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.239
Oh, you know what?

06:46.239 --> 06:48.542
We might want to go ahead and
separate them between doctors,

06:48.542 --> 06:50.878
'cause, uh,
Polly's awful riled up.

06:50.878 --> 06:54.281
You want me to give Dr. Hart one
of Dr. Breeland's patients?

06:54.281 --> 06:55.883
Brick's not gonna
like that.

06:55.883 --> 06:57.618
Well, it's a heat wave
in BlueBell,

06:57.618 --> 06:58.886
and you guys
are swamped.

06:58.886 --> 07:00.287
I'm sure Brick
won't mind that much.

07:00.287 --> 07:01.755
I'll take the bleeding one.
Uh, just tell Brick

07:01.755 --> 07:02.890
to give that one
a sedative or something.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.492
Well, I don't
want a sedative!

07:04.492 --> 07:06.560
But I do,
so will you save it for me?

07:06.560 --> 07:08.896
Bleeding lady?
Please, come in here.

07:08.896 --> 07:11.699
I'm telling you, she's getting
worse and worse.

07:11.699 --> 07:13.701
Lord knows,
Polly has always been difficult,

07:13.701 --> 07:17.170
but ever since mama died,
she's gone downright insane.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.438
We were going over
their mother's will

07:18.438 --> 07:19.873
for the third time
this month,

07:19.873 --> 07:21.374
and things got a little heated,
and before I knew it,

07:21.374 --> 07:23.844
my desk clock
was in the air.

07:23.844 --> 07:26.413
How long ago
did your mom pass away?

07:26.413 --> 07:27.915
About eight months ago,

07:27.915 --> 07:29.517
but we knew
it was coming.

07:29.517 --> 07:30.718
She'd been fighting
a losing battle

07:30.718 --> 07:32.586
with cancer
for three years or so.

07:32.586 --> 07:35.623
Hey, things are gonna
get easier, all right?

07:35.623 --> 07:37.457
We'll get through this
together.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.193
Promise.
Thank you, Mr. Tucker.

07:40.193 --> 07:42.530
Have you ever met a nicer lawyer
in your life?

07:42.530 --> 07:44.732
And so handsome.

07:44.732 --> 07:45.999
Broke the mold
with this one.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.200
Yes, they did.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.637
You are all fixed.

07:49.637 --> 07:53.106
Feel better... Few...

07:53.106 --> 07:54.474
BOTH:
Fiona.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.475
Fiona.
GEORGE:
Yeah.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.877
(laughs)
I knew that.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.812
Thank you.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.915
Y'all have a good day.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.217
We should turn the A/C up.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.620
It's hot in here,
don't you think?

08:11.825 --> 08:14.695
Mr. Tucker, I was just
coming to get you.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.196
Is everything
all right, Didi?

08:16.196 --> 08:17.364
Well, I wasn't sure

08:17.364 --> 08:19.767
how long you were gonna
be with the Parker twins,

08:19.767 --> 08:21.101
and I wanted to make sure

08:21.101 --> 08:22.803
I got your signature
on these documents.

08:22.803 --> 08:25.606
Okay, well, I appreciate an
assistant with initiative,

08:25.606 --> 08:27.708
but none of these
documents seem

08:27.708 --> 08:29.109
to be time-sensitive, so...

08:29.109 --> 08:30.377
They're not.

08:30.377 --> 08:33.013
I just wanted you to know
how seriously I take this job

08:33.013 --> 08:34.782
and how grateful I am
for the opportunity.

08:34.782 --> 08:36.015
Yeah, you're
quite welcome.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.650
And how much
I would appreciate it

08:37.650 --> 08:39.052
if you let me have
a half day tomorrow.

08:39.052 --> 08:41.188
You see, I have a date,
and it's the first date

08:41.188 --> 08:43.222
I've had in ages that
I'm actually excited about.

08:43.222 --> 08:44.558
Okay, Didi.

08:44.558 --> 08:46.059
And... And I know
it sounds frivolous,

08:46.059 --> 08:48.596
but I thought it might be nice
to get my hair done.

08:48.596 --> 08:49.863
It's hard
to explain.
Didi, I...

08:49.863 --> 08:51.498
But given the current
humidity levels,

08:51.498 --> 08:53.567
my hair has a tendency
to explode in ways

08:53.567 --> 08:55.035
that some might
find horrifying, and...

08:55.035 --> 08:57.404
Okay, you know what, Didi?
Didi, just hold that thought.

08:57.404 --> 08:59.339
Just for a second, okay?

08:59.339 --> 09:00.741
(phone beeps on)

09:00.741 --> 09:01.875
(phone ringing)

09:01.875 --> 09:03.443
Your mom likes irises, right?

09:03.443 --> 09:05.746
Because I'm preparing the
centerpiece for tomorrow night,

09:05.746 --> 09:07.815
and these little darlings
are about to bloom.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.249
She loves irises.
And guess what?

09:09.249 --> 09:10.918
I'll be coming home
early tomorrow.

09:10.918 --> 09:12.786
We're gonna close
the office at noon

09:12.786 --> 09:14.387
on account of Didi's big date.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.555
(squealing)

09:15.555 --> 09:17.224
Well, aren't you
the sweetest man

09:17.224 --> 09:18.358
who ever lived?

09:18.358 --> 09:19.593
And who is Didi going out with

09:19.593 --> 09:20.961
that she needs a whole day
to prepare?

09:20.961 --> 09:22.495
I don't know. I didn't ask.

09:22.495 --> 09:24.898
Well, you are her employer.
You do have a right to know.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.600
Lavon Hayes!
AKA, the mayor.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.135
AKA, gorgeous! AKA,

09:28.135 --> 09:30.137
nicest man in the world.
Could you die?

09:30.137 --> 09:32.272
I'm dying!
It's apparently Lavon.

09:32.272 --> 09:33.607
So, I'll be home early.

09:33.607 --> 09:38.111
If you need help with anything,
just let me know, all right?

09:38.111 --> 09:40.047
Babe?

09:40.047 --> 09:41.849
Oh, yes.

09:41.849 --> 09:45.819
Sorry. It's, um...
it's the heat.

09:45.819 --> 09:48.355
I'll see you later tonight,
and wish Didi well.

09:48.355 --> 09:49.623
Okay, will do.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.235
(sighs)

10:27.627 --> 10:29.697
Whoa.

10:29.697 --> 10:31.364
Okay.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.074
Oh, no.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.386
WADE:
Jump in!

11:27.087 --> 11:29.089
No, thank you.
Why not?

11:29.089 --> 11:30.958
Afraid you might
have too much fun?

11:30.958 --> 11:32.726
No. But I think
my version of fun

11:32.726 --> 11:34.627
is a lot different
than your version of fun.

11:34.627 --> 11:36.229
Yeah?

11:36.229 --> 11:37.965
What's your version look like?

11:37.965 --> 11:39.566
My first solo surgery.

11:39.566 --> 11:42.235
Gallbladder removal--
I got to use a laparoscope.

11:43.236 --> 11:44.504
You had to be there.

11:44.504 --> 11:47.407
Sounds epic.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.009
Tell you what.

11:49.009 --> 11:51.511
There's nothing more freeing
than jumping into a cool pond

11:51.511 --> 11:52.679
on a hot day.

11:52.679 --> 11:54.681
Lovely, but no.

11:54.681 --> 11:56.116
Not for me.

11:56.116 --> 11:56.984
Why not?

11:56.984 --> 11:58.819
One, I just blew out my hair.

11:58.819 --> 12:01.521
Two, I can't be
late for work.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.723
And three, I am pretty sure
there are snakes in there.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.894
* *

12:10.730 --> 12:13.867
Whoo!

12:13.867 --> 12:16.169
Now I know there are
snakes in there.

12:16.169 --> 12:17.237
(laughs)

12:21.708 --> 12:24.144
But I don't want
to get pregnant!

12:24.144 --> 12:25.412
You won't.
You can't.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.614
I don't want to fit you
for an IUD.

12:27.614 --> 12:29.182
You really don't need an IUD.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.151
Let's just say no
to the IUD.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.320
Lots of people my
age get pregnant.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.355
I read the tabloids.

12:35.355 --> 12:36.423
It could happen.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.490
Go on, now.

12:37.490 --> 12:38.758
Ooh.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.761
Thank you, dear.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.663
Have fun, you two.

12:43.663 --> 12:44.998
GEORGE:
Hey, how's it going?

12:44.998 --> 12:47.567
Hey. You bring me some more
crazy people to fix?

12:47.567 --> 12:49.036
Not just now.

12:49.036 --> 12:51.038
I'm actually here to
see Brick about Polly.

12:51.038 --> 12:52.039
Why? Did something happen?

12:52.039 --> 12:53.073
Maybe, maybe not.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.207
Fiona called me this morning.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.275
Apparently, they got
in another fight

12:55.275 --> 12:56.643
last night, and
now Fiona wants

12:56.643 --> 12:58.111
to have Polly committed.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.880
She's saying Polly is unfit
to take care of herself.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.714
Wow. Do you think that's true?

13:01.714 --> 13:03.483
Honestly, I'm not sure.

13:03.483 --> 13:04.417
Not sure about what?

13:04.417 --> 13:06.153
Fiona wants you to
sign an affidavit

13:06.153 --> 13:07.587
saying that Polly is
mentally unstable.

13:07.587 --> 13:10.790
And I have to admit, I
don't entirely disagree.

13:10.790 --> 13:14.027
Her outburst yesterday
was pretty scary.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.595
Fiona said that
she's only gotten worse

13:15.595 --> 13:16.930
since her mom passed away.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.265
She could be slipping into
a clinical depression.

13:18.265 --> 13:19.532
I think we
should consider

13:19.532 --> 13:21.068
prescribing antidepressants...

13:21.068 --> 13:22.870
Surprise, surprise.
Dr. New York City wants to

13:22.870 --> 13:24.204
push some pills.

13:24.204 --> 13:25.538
I didn't say that.
I was only suggesting...

13:25.538 --> 13:27.774
People, we are in the middle
of a heat wave.

13:27.774 --> 13:28.808
Polly isn't any crazier

13:28.808 --> 13:30.143
than the rest
of these folks.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.079
When the weather cools
down, so will her temper.

13:32.079 --> 13:34.381
My patient, my decision.

13:34.381 --> 13:35.482
Case closed.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.450
Now, George, I believe
we have someplace to be.

13:37.450 --> 13:38.451
Seriously?

13:38.451 --> 13:39.786
That's the end
of the conversation?

13:39.786 --> 13:41.955
I'm sorry, Zoe, I...

13:41.955 --> 13:43.756
My folks are in town,
Lemon's making dinner.

13:43.756 --> 13:46.459
It's kind of a big deal.
But I promise you this.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.028
Heat wave's gonna break
in a couple of days.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.196
If Polly's not feeling
any better by then,

13:49.196 --> 13:50.230
I will make sure she comes

13:50.230 --> 13:51.798
back in for a
sit-down, okay?

13:51.798 --> 13:53.666
Why are you asking
her permission?

13:53.666 --> 13:55.335
Polly isn't even her patient.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.469
Now, come on, son.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.505
And try not to kill anybody
while I'm gone.

13:58.505 --> 14:01.841
While you're gone, I won't
feel like killing anyone.

14:06.546 --> 14:07.580
Okay.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.049
Madison Avery.

14:10.517 --> 14:14.154
I glued it to my tummy
so I wouldn't drown.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.925
Okay.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.429
I don't see
the bourbon anywhere.

14:22.429 --> 14:23.396
How odd.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.265
Well, why don't
I pour you a glass

14:25.265 --> 14:26.699
of fresh-squeezed lemonade
instead?

14:26.699 --> 14:27.834
Found it!

14:27.834 --> 14:29.836
MRS. TUCKER:
My, my, my.

14:29.836 --> 14:31.004
Fresh-squeezed lemonade.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.772
Did you do that
all by yourself, dear?

14:32.772 --> 14:33.873
Oh, yes, ma'am.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.008
I believe
everything tastes better

14:35.008 --> 14:36.276
when you make it with love.

14:36.276 --> 14:37.877
Speaking of which,
that duck recipe

14:37.877 --> 14:39.479
you gave me was just heavenly.

14:39.479 --> 14:40.981
Oh, no.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.615
Is that what
we're having tonight?

14:42.615 --> 14:43.750
I wish you'd have told me.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.452
Harold and I
had duck last night.

14:45.452 --> 14:48.388
Now, don't burst
a gullet, dear.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.889
It's fine.
I'm sure yours

14:49.889 --> 14:53.893
will be an entirely
different experience.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.996
Oh, don't be silly.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.564
We don't need to eat that duck.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.033
Um, why don't we just eat
at Fancie's instead?

15:00.033 --> 15:01.901
Knock, knock.

15:01.901 --> 15:02.802
(all murmur excitedly)

15:02.802 --> 15:04.771
There he is!

15:04.771 --> 15:05.772
Hey, Mama.

15:05.772 --> 15:06.773
Hey, baby.
How are you?

15:06.773 --> 15:08.375
How are you?

15:08.375 --> 15:09.542
Dad.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.278
(chuckles)

15:11.278 --> 15:12.812
Where'd Brick get to?

15:12.812 --> 15:14.681
GEORGE:
Uh, he'll be right here.
He said he had to

15:14.681 --> 15:16.449
stop by the store and pick up
something real quick.

15:16.449 --> 15:17.985
Well, why don't you
give him a call

15:17.985 --> 15:19.352
and tell him to meet us
at Fancie's.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.321
Change of plans, sweetheart.
Isn't that so fun?

15:21.321 --> 15:23.190
I just love spontaneity,
don't you, Mrs. Tucker?

15:23.190 --> 15:24.992
Why in the world
would we go out to eat

15:24.992 --> 15:26.159
when you went through
all the trouble...

15:26.159 --> 15:27.794
Oh, George! Stop.

15:27.794 --> 15:28.962
There's no
need to get

15:28.962 --> 15:31.664
so wound up over
a tiny little thing.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.366
We can just
cut it up

15:33.366 --> 15:36.469
and I can make it into a salad
and we can eat it all week long.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.571
Now, let's see if I can get
that reservation at Fancie's.

15:38.571 --> 15:40.307
You know, why don't you
let George do that.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.109
You know, the last
time you made

15:42.109 --> 15:44.677
the reservation,
we wound up at that awful table

15:44.677 --> 15:45.878
right near the restrooms.

15:45.878 --> 15:46.980
You remember that?
(laughter)

15:46.980 --> 15:48.848
I do.

15:48.848 --> 15:50.050
Oh, it was dreadful!

15:50.050 --> 15:51.051
Silly me.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.420
(laughs)

15:53.420 --> 15:55.222
(groans)

15:55.222 --> 15:57.224
Unfortunately,
there is not a prescription

15:57.224 --> 15:58.791
for a hangover, Shelley.

15:58.791 --> 16:02.229
But my advice would be to stop
taking tequila shots on the job.

16:02.229 --> 16:03.930
That's more
preventative medicine.

16:03.930 --> 16:05.932
Fair enough,
but just so you know,

16:05.932 --> 16:07.700
I never drink on the job.

16:07.700 --> 16:08.968
I hardly ever
do shots.

16:08.968 --> 16:09.969
It's just,

16:09.969 --> 16:11.438
the heat wave.

16:11.438 --> 16:12.939
Heat wave.

16:12.939 --> 16:14.207
I know it's juvenile,

16:14.207 --> 16:17.710
but sometimes it just
feels good to be bad.

16:17.710 --> 16:18.978
Don't you think?

16:18.978 --> 16:20.347
(door opens)

16:20.347 --> 16:21.981
We're closed, Wade.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.250
Here's the acetaminophen.

16:23.250 --> 16:24.817
It's the best I can do.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.320
Hey, look, I'm sorry to
barge in after hours, Doc,

16:27.320 --> 16:29.222
but, uh, I was
taking out the trash

16:29.222 --> 16:31.258
over at the Rammer Jammer
and the fence

16:31.258 --> 16:33.226
kind of jumped out and got me.

16:33.226 --> 16:34.827
You think it needs stitches?

16:34.827 --> 16:36.096
I have to clean it up to see.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.197
Why don't you go sit down

16:37.197 --> 16:38.665
in there
and I'll take a look.

16:38.665 --> 16:39.732
All right.

16:41.768 --> 16:43.970
You should totally hit that.

16:43.970 --> 16:45.672
Wade?

16:45.672 --> 16:46.739
No!

16:46.739 --> 16:48.275
I could never.

16:48.275 --> 16:49.742
He's just so...

16:49.742 --> 16:52.011
Beautiful? Available? Gorgeous?

16:52.011 --> 16:53.146
Not where I was going.

16:53.146 --> 16:55.248
Plus, it's obvious he likes you.

16:55.248 --> 16:56.416
No, he doesn't.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.251
I work with the man every day.

16:58.251 --> 16:59.752
I can tell these things.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.488
The way he
looks at you.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.523
You have definitely
gotten under his skin.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.759
Maybe it's time you let him
get under yours.

17:06.759 --> 17:07.926
Come on.

17:07.926 --> 17:09.061
The fever hits everyone
eventually.

17:09.061 --> 17:10.463
You might as well give in.

17:10.463 --> 17:11.998
Ow.

17:11.998 --> 17:14.300
(groans)

17:20.039 --> 17:21.241
Tucker, party of five.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.041
Right this way.

17:23.041 --> 17:25.744
This was such a great idea,
Mrs. Tucker.

17:25.744 --> 17:28.548
I'm so glad you thought of it.
(chuckles)

17:34.487 --> 17:37.257
Well, isn't this
a coincidence!

17:46.366 --> 17:48.268
Ow.

17:52.105 --> 17:54.207
* *

18:00.380 --> 18:03.082
Sure are taking your time
with that bandage, Doc.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.091
There. You're
good to go.

18:12.091 --> 18:15.695
I appreciate
all the fine work you did.

18:17.230 --> 18:21.268
If there's anything
I can do to repay the favor,

18:21.268 --> 18:23.403
I'll be at
the Rammer Jammer later.

18:23.403 --> 18:26.573
So, you know where to find me.

18:45.325 --> 18:47.126
Need something,
Doctor?

18:55.101 --> 18:56.203
Addy, I thought
you left already.

18:56.203 --> 18:57.470
I was just looking for some gum.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.372
Yeah, we, uh, keep it
in the condom jar.

18:59.372 --> 19:01.374
Makes a fun treasure
hunt for the kids.

19:01.374 --> 19:03.310
Listen up now,
it's okay.

19:03.310 --> 19:05.178
The heat has finally
caught up with you.

19:05.178 --> 19:06.379
Happens to the best of them.

19:06.379 --> 19:07.980
Happened to me in '08,
which is why

19:07.980 --> 19:09.382
I have a Snoopy tattoo
on my ass.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.251
Point is, heat
waves make us

19:11.251 --> 19:13.253
do stupid things we
almost always regret.

19:13.253 --> 19:15.522
No reason you
have to succumb.

19:15.522 --> 19:16.823
I suggest
you go home,

19:16.823 --> 19:19.526
take a cold shower, and
let the moment pass.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.294
What if I don't want it to?

19:21.294 --> 19:22.629
Excuse me?

19:22.629 --> 19:24.364
Everyone else gets to act crazy.
Why can't I?

19:24.364 --> 19:25.598
Slow down,
antsy pants.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.099
You're not making
any sense.

19:27.099 --> 19:28.167
So what?

19:28.167 --> 19:29.969
Maybe I'm tired of making sense.

19:29.969 --> 19:31.204
Always doing
the right thing.

19:31.204 --> 19:32.372
My whole life,
I've acted appropriately

19:32.372 --> 19:33.906
and considered the consequences.

19:33.906 --> 19:35.975
I'm probably the only girl
in New York

19:35.975 --> 19:37.277
that never had
a one-night stand.

19:37.277 --> 19:38.278
And that's a bad thing?

19:38.278 --> 19:39.812
I wouldn't know, would I?

19:39.812 --> 19:42.148
Because I never
let myself find out.

19:42.148 --> 19:43.483
Until today.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.619
My time has come, Addy!

19:48.488 --> 19:50.490
If you'll excuse me.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.429
Took too many.

19:56.429 --> 19:58.631
Seems kind of wasteful.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.171
MRS. TUCKER:
Didi's your new associate?

20:05.171 --> 20:06.606
Assistant, Mom.

20:06.606 --> 20:08.207
Either way,
she's awfully pretty.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.543
I don't think
I'd let Mr. Tucker

20:10.543 --> 20:11.578
hire a woman that beautiful.

20:11.578 --> 20:13.713
Did you change
your hair, Mom?

20:13.713 --> 20:15.482
'Cause it really
becomes you.

20:15.482 --> 20:16.483
Aw, thank you, honey.

20:16.483 --> 20:18.785
That's so sweet.

20:18.785 --> 20:19.919
Lemon, you should see

20:19.919 --> 20:21.187
my stylist.

20:21.187 --> 20:23.556
She might be able to help
with that forehead situation.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.292
What?

20:25.292 --> 20:26.426
Lemon, didn't you
have a funny story

20:26.426 --> 20:27.527
you wanted to
share with Mama

20:27.527 --> 20:29.329
about your Junior
League meeting?

20:29.329 --> 20:30.963
Oh, do dish. What happened?

20:30.963 --> 20:34.834
Oh, yes, it was, um,
a really funny story.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.603
It's so good.

20:36.603 --> 20:38.671
Um, it's such a good story.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.407
Um...

20:41.474 --> 20:43.410
Uh, you know what?
I need to, uh,

20:43.410 --> 20:44.577
powder my nose.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.813
I'll be back in a jiff.
(chuckles)

20:46.813 --> 20:48.648
Uh...
Yes.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.554
Well, at least tell me
what it's about.

21:02.295 --> 21:05.031
(clears throat)

21:07.367 --> 21:09.369
What are you doing here?

21:09.369 --> 21:11.270
I could ask you
the same question.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.372
Excuse me?

21:12.372 --> 21:14.341
Sabotaging my date
by spying on me?

21:14.341 --> 21:15.775
Are you insane?

21:15.775 --> 21:17.510
Do you think that I would choose

21:17.510 --> 21:18.878
this restaurant
on purpose?

21:18.878 --> 21:20.513
Okay, well, I'm supposed
to believe this is all

21:20.513 --> 21:21.814
just a natural
coincidence?

21:21.814 --> 21:23.249
Know what, I don't care
what you believe,

21:23.249 --> 21:24.651
because I'm trying

21:24.651 --> 21:28.621
to collect myself
and you're making me all...

21:28.621 --> 21:30.857
Making you all what?
You're making me all...

21:38.898 --> 21:41.000
* *

22:05.825 --> 22:07.627
* *

22:17.837 --> 22:18.971
S'up, Wade?

22:18.971 --> 22:21.007
* *

22:25.712 --> 22:28.915
I am so sorry I'm late.

22:28.915 --> 22:30.917
Clora.
Darling.

22:30.917 --> 22:32.251
Hi. Hi.
Hi.

22:32.251 --> 22:33.886
Lemonade.
Hey, Harold.

22:33.886 --> 22:36.222
I heard about
your new Mercedes,

22:36.222 --> 22:38.057
and I thought maybe

22:38.057 --> 22:40.460
you might want to decorate it.

22:40.460 --> 22:42.462
(laughter)

22:42.462 --> 22:44.764
(groans)
Very funny.

22:44.764 --> 22:46.533
WAITRESS:
Shall I tell you

22:46.533 --> 22:47.800
about the specials?
Yes, please.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.101
I'd like
another bourbon.

22:49.101 --> 22:50.369
We have a very nice lamb.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.504
Brick,

22:51.504 --> 22:52.872
did you catch
the Cowboy-Saint game?

22:52.872 --> 22:54.907
GEORGE:
Wait, no, we're
not gonna talk...

22:54.907 --> 22:58.044
What about it, Hal?
I'm just curious if you saw
Ingram's fumble in the third.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.612
And our crab cakes are

22:59.612 --> 23:02.381
out of this world.
Oh, well, Daddy, you just
love the crab cakes here.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.417
How about we get a few
orders for the table.

23:04.417 --> 23:05.785
MRS. TUCKER:
Are you sure?

23:05.785 --> 23:07.219
Wedding's just
a few months away, dear,

23:07.219 --> 23:08.555
and you know
what they say:

23:08.555 --> 23:10.823
"A moment on the lips..."
Mom, please?

23:10.823 --> 23:12.759
Well, I'm just saying
that it takes a 'Bama man

23:12.759 --> 23:14.794
to have those butterfingers.
Perhaps I'll come back.

23:14.794 --> 23:17.697
BRICK: You know, from where
I sat, that left guard let that

23:17.697 --> 23:19.365
D-tackle slip through there

23:19.365 --> 23:21.000
like he owed him
money, just like

23:21.000 --> 23:22.201
he always did at Auburn.

23:22.201 --> 23:24.336
You must've been sitting
with a blindfold on...

23:24.336 --> 23:25.672
Here we go.

23:25.672 --> 23:27.707
BRICK: ...my DVR-- maybe
a little instant replay

23:27.707 --> 23:28.841
might help you
understand

23:28.841 --> 23:30.142
what really happened.

23:30.142 --> 23:31.678
Oh, you know what,
gentlemen? Why don't we

23:31.678 --> 23:33.546
just go ahead and agree
to disagree on this one.

23:33.546 --> 23:35.247
You're right, George.

23:35.247 --> 23:36.949
It's not like we can prove

23:36.949 --> 23:38.518
who's right anyway.
LEMON:
Thank you, Daddy.

23:38.518 --> 23:39.986
Thank you, Pops.
BRICK:
Unless, of course,

23:39.986 --> 23:42.455
we could get a
professional opinion.

23:42.455 --> 23:43.255
Get a what?

23:43.255 --> 23:44.657
Uh, uh, Mayor Hayes,

23:44.657 --> 23:46.993
have you got a minute?

23:46.993 --> 23:49.195
Excuse me.

23:50.296 --> 23:52.231
LAVON:
How y'all doing tonight?

23:52.231 --> 23:56.469
Uh, Mayor, I-I'm sorry,
we did not mean to
interrupt your date.

23:56.469 --> 23:58.270
No, it's no problem,
no problem.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.306
Lavon Hayes,
I'm a big fan.

24:00.306 --> 24:02.008
Oh. Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

24:02.008 --> 24:04.276
Oh, come on, there's no way
he's gonna be objective.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.545
He bleeds
crimson and white.

24:05.545 --> 24:07.947
We were just having
a bit of a disagreement

24:07.947 --> 24:09.616
about the
Cowboys game.
Oh, oh, you got to love it

24:09.616 --> 24:14.153
when we go into O.T.
We would love to have
your expert analysis.

24:14.153 --> 24:16.422
Maybe you and your date
would like to join us.

24:16.422 --> 24:19.559
Oh, Daddy, uh...
I'm sure the mayor has

24:19.559 --> 24:21.528
no interest in
sitting with us.

24:23.696 --> 24:25.832
We'd love to join you.

24:25.832 --> 24:27.333
(men laughing)
Didi! Uh,

24:27.333 --> 24:28.801
come on over here.

24:28.801 --> 24:31.437
BRICK: Could we get a couple
of chairs over here, please?

24:31.437 --> 24:33.906
* *

24:36.976 --> 24:39.145
* *

24:46.519 --> 24:49.055
* *

24:50.456 --> 24:53.259
(chuckles)
You all right down there?

24:53.259 --> 24:54.493
Yeah.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.128
Little slippery.

24:56.128 --> 24:57.797
Yeah.

24:57.797 --> 24:59.198
Um...

24:59.198 --> 25:00.733
can I get you something?

25:00.733 --> 25:03.369
I think you know.

25:03.369 --> 25:04.971
Wine.

25:04.971 --> 25:06.505
No.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.708
Uh... beer?

25:09.676 --> 25:12.511
Y-Yeah, beer... beer.
Beer could help.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.080
All right.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.782
Wait, no, no. I-I...

25:15.782 --> 25:18.350
No, I don't want
anything to drink.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.087
Oh.

25:21.087 --> 25:22.488
So...?

25:22.488 --> 25:24.557
So...

25:25.524 --> 25:28.094
(brief chuckle)

25:28.094 --> 25:29.195
You got a...

25:29.195 --> 25:31.764
you got a contact lens
situation, or...

25:31.764 --> 25:33.499
No. (clears throat)

25:33.499 --> 25:35.334
(exhales)

25:35.334 --> 25:37.737
Your place, 11:30.

25:39.038 --> 25:40.907
I'll be there.

25:40.907 --> 25:43.610
* *

25:52.418 --> 25:54.654
Polly? Are you feeling okay?

25:54.654 --> 25:56.222
Who are you?

25:56.222 --> 25:57.957
How do you know my name?

25:57.957 --> 25:59.525
I'm Dr. Zoe Hart.
We met yesterday

25:59.525 --> 26:00.526
at my office.

26:00.526 --> 26:01.661
I treated your sister.

26:01.661 --> 26:03.262
Oh, I don't have a sister.

26:03.262 --> 26:05.397
I don't know you.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.900
You get away from me.

26:16.575 --> 26:17.677
Are you okay?

26:17.677 --> 26:18.945
Did you see that?
Yeah. It looked

26:18.945 --> 26:20.046
like she hit you pretty hard.

26:20.046 --> 26:21.080
I don't care
what anyone says,

26:21.080 --> 26:22.548
that is not
"heat wave" crazy,

26:22.548 --> 26:23.616
that is "crazy crazy."

26:23.616 --> 26:25.017
Do me a favor?

26:25.017 --> 26:26.653
Tell Wade I'll be a
few minutes late.
Sure,

26:26.653 --> 26:27.687
no problem.

26:27.687 --> 26:28.921
Late for what?

26:34.794 --> 26:36.428
You don't run a sweep
to the short side

26:36.428 --> 26:37.797
on fourth and two.
Yes, you do,

26:37.797 --> 26:39.565
if you want to catch
them off guard.

26:39.565 --> 26:40.833
HAROLD: Who the hell
makes that call?

26:40.833 --> 26:42.468
(both talking at once)

26:42.468 --> 26:44.971
You sure would've been a bad
coach, I'm telling you now.

26:44.971 --> 26:48.374
(George and Harold continue
talking over each other)

26:48.374 --> 26:50.677
...defensive back coming
in there like that.
And what happens is,

26:50.677 --> 26:52.544
'Bama comes in here
and just knocks...

26:52.544 --> 26:54.881
Pops, maybe that's enough
football talk for one evening.

26:54.881 --> 26:56.515
You just better slice
this guy in half.

26:56.515 --> 26:58.584
You've got 13 men
on the field.
You don't know what...

26:58.584 --> 27:00.119
(Brick and Harold
continuing arguing)

27:00.119 --> 27:01.854
And how is the duck
this evening?

27:01.854 --> 27:03.756
Oh, just perfect.
Thank you.

27:03.756 --> 27:05.557
HAROLD: Let me show you
why you never run

27:05.557 --> 27:07.159
to the short side.

27:07.159 --> 27:09.528
Well... now it looks
like they're in it
for the long haul,

27:09.528 --> 27:11.864
so y'all can probably head
back to your table now.

27:11.864 --> 27:14.200
I think that's
a good idea.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.234
How did you two meet?

27:15.234 --> 27:18.237
Do you want to tell
them, sugar plum?

27:18.237 --> 27:19.872
Sugar what?

27:19.872 --> 27:22.241
Well, you know, it's,
uh... it's simple, really.

27:22.241 --> 27:25.011
From the minute
I laid eyes on Didi,

27:25.011 --> 27:26.813
I just knew there was
something special here.

27:26.813 --> 27:28.214
You know,
kind of like

27:28.214 --> 27:30.016
destiny or something.
Give me a break.

27:30.016 --> 27:32.051
What's the problem?

27:32.051 --> 27:34.020
Oh... it's not a problem.

27:34.020 --> 27:36.522
I just find it a little hard
to believe, that's all.

27:36.522 --> 27:38.590
You don't believe
in soul mates?
DIDI: Soul mates?

27:38.590 --> 27:40.893
Why not?

27:40.893 --> 27:43.696
My goodness, well, I apologize.

27:43.696 --> 27:45.231
I had no idea

27:45.231 --> 27:46.665
it was so serious.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.300
Well, maybe we
should plan

27:48.300 --> 27:50.436
a double wedding--
what do you say, Didi?

27:50.436 --> 27:51.904
Wouldn't that be so fun?

27:51.904 --> 27:54.473
I'm so sorry, I'm suddenly
not feeling very well.

27:54.473 --> 27:57.509
(stammering):
Uh... I think...
I think I should go.

27:57.509 --> 27:58.778
Wait. Wait.

27:58.778 --> 28:00.446
LAVON:
Oh, okay,
uh, you know,

28:00.446 --> 28:02.281
maybe I should make sure
she's all right.

28:02.281 --> 28:05.384
It was a pleasure meeting you,
Mrs. Tucker, Mr. Tucker.

28:05.384 --> 28:06.585
(stammering)

28:06.585 --> 28:08.921
What happened?

28:10.322 --> 28:12.759
Zoe?

28:12.759 --> 28:14.794
LEMON:
You've got to be kidding me.

28:14.794 --> 28:16.262
What the hell are
you doing here?

28:16.262 --> 28:17.930
We have a situation
with a patient.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.932
Your housekeeper told me
that you would be here.

28:19.932 --> 28:21.600
I'm sorry to interrupt.
You must be the Tuckers.

28:21.600 --> 28:24.737
I'm Zoe Hart,
the new doctor in town.
Well, aren't you

28:24.737 --> 28:25.805
itty-bitty and precious!

28:25.805 --> 28:27.073
GEORGE:
What happened to you?

28:27.073 --> 28:28.808
Polly Parker happened to me.
She attacked me,

28:28.808 --> 28:30.309
and then she ran off.
Look, I would look

28:30.309 --> 28:31.811
for her myself--
I don't know where to start.

28:31.811 --> 28:32.945
You need an ice pack.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.380
I can ask the
waitress for one.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.048
While this is a truly
fascinating story,

28:36.048 --> 28:37.817
I still don't understand
what you're doing here.

28:37.817 --> 28:39.385
I'm worried that
she might be dangerous,

28:39.385 --> 28:40.686
not only to other people

28:40.686 --> 28:42.922
but to herself.
Brick, I need you
to help me find her,

28:42.922 --> 28:44.556
make sure she's okay.
If she's scared,

28:44.556 --> 28:46.759
she probably went home-- that's
the first place I'd check.

28:46.759 --> 28:49.628
Yeah, but if I show up
there by myself, it
might agitate her more.

28:49.628 --> 28:51.030
She needs to see
a familiar face.

28:51.030 --> 28:52.198
She's probably right.
We're in the middle

28:52.198 --> 28:54.233
of dinner.
Don't be selfish, Lemon.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.936
We're talking about
a medical emergency.

28:56.936 --> 28:59.505
Fine, fine. Well, let's
just do it real quick, okay?

28:59.505 --> 29:02.374
Over my dead body!

29:03.709 --> 29:04.710
Lemon?

29:04.710 --> 29:06.045
Honey?

29:06.045 --> 29:08.047
Do you know
how hard I worked

29:08.047 --> 29:09.916
to make this
evening special?

29:09.916 --> 29:11.350
Between the duck and the irises

29:11.350 --> 29:12.985
and squeezing
all those damn lemons?

29:12.985 --> 29:15.121
And all you people
can talk about is football,

29:15.121 --> 29:17.389
football, football, and
"You sure you want to eat that?"

29:17.389 --> 29:19.992
And then this little piece of
New York City sass comes walking

29:19.992 --> 29:21.460
in here and tries
to steal my daddy?!

29:21.460 --> 29:22.661
If anybody is leaving

29:22.661 --> 29:23.930
this sham of a dinner party,

29:23.930 --> 29:25.664
it is me, Lemon Breeland,
do you hear that?

29:25.664 --> 29:26.966
I am leaving!

29:26.966 --> 29:29.435
I am leaving!
 I am leaving!

29:37.676 --> 29:41.447
Can't imagine why I ever
called her high-strung.

29:42.882 --> 29:44.516
ZOE:
So...

29:44.516 --> 29:46.618
anyway, could we go now?

29:46.618 --> 29:48.821
GEORGE:
Lemon.

29:51.490 --> 29:53.025
Lemon, come on.

29:53.025 --> 29:54.293
Lemon, wait up!

29:54.293 --> 29:57.063
Just go back
to your family, George.

29:58.664 --> 30:01.000
Baby. Hey, Lemon,

30:01.000 --> 30:02.902
it wasn't that bad.

30:02.902 --> 30:04.736
(panting)

30:04.736 --> 30:08.807
I just... I just want
to be alone, okay?

30:09.641 --> 30:11.844
Please.

30:17.583 --> 30:20.686
That's kind of ridiculous,
interrupting me in the
middle of a family meal.

30:20.686 --> 30:23.189
Okay, I have somewhere
better to be, too,
okay, Brickeroosky?

30:23.189 --> 30:25.391
Believe me. Plus,
your patient attacked
me out of nowhere.

30:25.391 --> 30:27.359
There's something
definitely wrong with her.

30:27.359 --> 30:29.828
Well, says you.
I'll bet there's a
whole bunch of folks

30:29.828 --> 30:31.630
want to smash you in
the head with something.

30:31.630 --> 30:33.966
I for one resist
the urge every day.
Mm-hmm.

30:33.966 --> 30:35.667
Okay, her lights
are on; she's home.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.069
Let me do the
talking. Please.

30:37.069 --> 30:38.938
I don't think that's
going to be possible.

30:38.938 --> 30:41.140
You just love making
it difficult, don't...

30:44.576 --> 30:46.312
Polly?

30:54.286 --> 30:56.355
Does your neck feel okay?
Where am I?

30:56.355 --> 30:58.324
What happened?
All right,
it's Dr. Breeland.

30:58.324 --> 31:00.792
You're okay. We're gonna
take you to the office.

31:00.792 --> 31:02.594
Oh, my head is throbbing.

31:02.594 --> 31:04.630
Is there anything else
bothering you?
I'm dizzy.

31:04.630 --> 31:06.098
I think I might throw up.

31:06.933 --> 31:09.635
Let's take her car.

31:15.074 --> 31:17.944
Do you remember seeing me at
the Rammer Jammer tonight?

31:17.944 --> 31:19.946
Was I at the Rammer Jammer?

31:19.946 --> 31:21.313
I don't remember that

31:21.313 --> 31:23.249
at all.

31:23.249 --> 31:26.052
Oh, my God,
what is that smell?

31:26.052 --> 31:27.886
That could be exhaust fumes

31:27.886 --> 31:30.656
coming up through
the floorboards.

31:30.656 --> 31:32.758
Polly, when was the last
time you had this car

31:32.758 --> 31:35.894
looked at?
I don't know,
it was my mom's car.

31:35.894 --> 31:40.099
Have you been driving this car
ever since she passed away?

31:40.099 --> 31:41.500
I work out in Mobile.

31:41.500 --> 31:44.703
It's faster than
taking the bus.

31:44.703 --> 31:45.972
Usually.

31:45.972 --> 31:47.506
Do your headaches
tend to get worse

31:47.506 --> 31:49.541
the longer time you
spend in the car?

31:49.541 --> 31:53.946
Well, I never thought
about it that way, but yeah.

31:53.946 --> 31:55.447
I guess they do.

31:56.848 --> 31:58.617
Well, this better be good--

31:58.617 --> 32:01.287
I was right in the middle
of The Bourne Identity.

32:01.287 --> 32:03.289
I love me some Matt Damon.

32:03.289 --> 32:05.024
We found out what's
wrong with your sister.

32:05.024 --> 32:06.725
She's not suffering

32:06.725 --> 32:08.394
from dementia
or depression.

32:08.394 --> 32:11.697
It turns out that your
mom's car has slowly
been killing her.

32:11.697 --> 32:14.133
What?!
We did a blood test.

32:14.133 --> 32:16.402
She tested positive for
carbon monoxide poisoning.

32:16.402 --> 32:18.570
It explains everything,
from the violent outbursts

32:18.570 --> 32:22.041
to the flushed cheeks.
I just thought she was
flush from the heat.

32:22.041 --> 32:23.409
No, she's gonna be fine.

32:23.409 --> 32:25.744
We're administering
oxygen to her right now.

32:25.744 --> 32:27.346
Well, can I see her?

32:28.347 --> 32:29.581
(knocking)

32:29.581 --> 32:32.551
Hey, there's somebody here
to see you, Polly.

32:32.551 --> 32:35.954
Fiona, is that you?
I was so worried!

32:35.954 --> 32:38.524
FIONA:
I told you to take that
old car in for a tune-up.

32:38.524 --> 32:39.992
POLLY: Well, I
told you I wasn't

32:39.992 --> 32:41.793
gonna pay for it.
Well, it's your car.

32:41.793 --> 32:44.063
Well, I never wanted the
car, I wanted the vase.

32:44.063 --> 32:46.765
Well, you got the car.
Well, you got the house.

32:46.765 --> 32:49.901
(Polly and Fiona arguing)

32:49.901 --> 32:52.138
You were always a bully to me.
You never made
cheerleading

32:52.138 --> 32:53.439
and couldn't get a boyfriend.

32:53.439 --> 32:54.973
Ladies.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.308
Everything looks
really good here.

32:56.308 --> 32:57.976
You guys have a nice night.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.511
BOTH:
Thank you.

32:59.511 --> 33:00.446
Anyway...

33:00.446 --> 33:01.980
POLLY:
Stop picking on me.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.649
FIONA:
I'm not picking on you.

33:04.650 --> 33:05.884
Hey.

33:05.884 --> 33:07.019
You leaving?

33:07.019 --> 33:08.554
Got someplace to be.

33:08.554 --> 33:12.591
Besides, she's your patient,
right?

33:24.136 --> 33:26.338
There's nobody here.

33:27.806 --> 33:31.310
We need to talk.

33:31.310 --> 33:33.312
Okay.

33:36.482 --> 33:39.251
I assume you want to go first.

33:40.086 --> 33:42.754
This needs to stop.

33:42.754 --> 33:44.490
What needs to stop?

33:44.490 --> 33:45.657
This.

33:45.657 --> 33:46.792
Us.

33:46.792 --> 33:49.295
We stopped a long time ago.

33:49.295 --> 33:50.829
Six months to be exact.

33:50.829 --> 33:52.631
I'm not talking about that.

33:52.631 --> 33:55.767
I'm talking about this...
this thing.

33:55.767 --> 33:58.837
This tension.

33:58.837 --> 34:00.206
I can't handle it.

34:00.206 --> 34:02.208
Having secret fights
in restaurants.

34:02.208 --> 34:03.475
You should've thought of that

34:03.475 --> 34:06.312
before you decided to spy on me
and my date.

34:06.312 --> 34:08.313
I didn't know that you were
going to be there. I swear.

34:08.313 --> 34:09.748
You didn't try to
send Didi out of town

34:09.748 --> 34:11.382
right when you found out I
was interested in her?

34:11.382 --> 34:13.319
Yes, I may have done that.

34:13.319 --> 34:14.719
Then you'll be happy to know

34:14.719 --> 34:17.123
that she has no interest
in going out with me again.

34:17.123 --> 34:19.358
Not that I could
say I blame her.

34:19.358 --> 34:22.128
I'm not saying
that I'm blameless in all this.

34:22.128 --> 34:23.995
Okay? I am...

34:23.995 --> 34:25.531
so confused.

34:25.531 --> 34:27.199
And this is so hard for me, too.

34:27.199 --> 34:30.202
It's hard because
you made it hard.

34:30.202 --> 34:33.205
You got to make
all the decisions.

34:33.205 --> 34:36.007
I'm trying to move on,
and you won't let me.

34:36.007 --> 34:37.543
I know. I'm sorry, but...

34:37.543 --> 34:39.245
What are you sorry about, Lemon?

34:39.245 --> 34:41.547
Tell me something
that means anything,

34:41.547 --> 34:45.083
because right now, I don't
even know how to be anymore.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.953
What do you want
from me here?

34:47.953 --> 34:49.721
Huh?

34:49.721 --> 34:51.956
(sobs)

34:51.956 --> 34:54.159
Lemon.

35:16.748 --> 35:18.750
* *

35:35.167 --> 35:37.203
I don't know what I want.

35:39.705 --> 35:41.873
I'm so sorry
that I want so much.

36:13.705 --> 36:15.707
* *

36:38.730 --> 36:41.367
Looks like
the heat wave broke.

36:44.270 --> 36:45.704
Doesn't mean
you can't come inside.

36:47.739 --> 36:49.841
Actually, it does.

36:52.911 --> 36:55.347
I guess I'm just not
that kind of girl.

37:14.500 --> 37:16.468
All right, y'all
travel safe now.

37:16.468 --> 37:19.405
Give Brick a nice Auburn
War Eagle cry for me.

37:19.405 --> 37:21.206
Will ya?
Will do, Pops.

37:21.206 --> 37:22.741
All right.
All right.

37:22.741 --> 37:25.411
Oh, I hate
these short visits.

37:25.411 --> 37:29.214
Why don't you drive out
next weekend?

37:29.214 --> 37:30.316
I'll uncover the
pool for you.

37:30.316 --> 37:31.883
I'll see what Lemon thinks.

37:31.883 --> 37:33.819
If you wanted to come without
Lemon, that'd be fine, too.

37:33.819 --> 37:35.754
Mom...
What?

37:35.754 --> 37:37.756
I'm just saying...
I know what you're saying

37:37.756 --> 37:38.957
'cause you say it all the time,
and from now on,

37:38.957 --> 37:40.492
if you got an opinion
about my fiancée,

37:40.492 --> 37:42.027
you can keep it
to yourself.

37:42.027 --> 37:43.228
George.

37:43.228 --> 37:44.696
I'm marrying Lemon, Mom.

37:44.696 --> 37:47.666
I know she has a tendency
to be overdramatic sometimes,

37:47.666 --> 37:49.501
she's not always agreeable
when you want her to be,

37:49.501 --> 37:51.837
and every so often
she throws a temper tantrum

37:51.837 --> 37:53.505
that would
make a two-year-old blush,

37:53.505 --> 37:54.773
but I love her.

37:54.773 --> 37:58.544
For all those reasons and more,
I love her.

37:58.544 --> 37:59.811
And that's all she was trying
to do last night

37:59.811 --> 38:01.413
was try and make you
love her, too.

38:01.413 --> 38:02.748
Well, that's
just silliness.

38:02.748 --> 38:04.550
If you love her,
I love her.

38:04.550 --> 38:08.153
I just want you to
have everything,

38:08.153 --> 38:11.256
'cause you're my perfect
boy, that's all.

38:11.256 --> 38:12.724
Nobody's perfect, Mom.

38:12.724 --> 38:14.259
Not even me.

38:14.259 --> 38:15.427
I find that hard to believe.

38:15.427 --> 38:17.629
(horn honks twice)
Coming.

38:19.531 --> 38:21.733
(door closes, engine starting)

38:21.733 --> 38:23.735
Bye.

38:27.706 --> 38:29.975
Oh, you feel that soggy breeze?

38:29.975 --> 38:31.977
I never thought I'd be so happy
about 90 degree weather.

38:31.977 --> 38:34.079
BlueBell aims to please.

38:34.079 --> 38:37.516
It misses most of the time,
but I'll take what I can get.

38:37.516 --> 38:39.985
(chuckles)
So tell me.

38:39.985 --> 38:44.022
Did Zoe Hart wind up using her
free pass last night?

38:44.022 --> 38:45.957
Zoe Hart did not.

38:45.957 --> 38:47.125
Aw...

38:47.125 --> 38:49.127
That makes Lavon Hayes sad.

38:49.127 --> 38:50.362
Don't be sad.

38:50.362 --> 38:51.930
I think everything
worked out for the best.

38:51.930 --> 38:53.532
But at least I didn't
do anything stupid

38:53.532 --> 38:55.300
that I would've regretted.

38:55.300 --> 38:56.602
As far as I'm concerned,

38:56.602 --> 38:57.836
a life without regret
ain't worth living.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.771
It's good to follow
your instincts,

38:59.771 --> 39:02.808
let yourself get caught up in
the moment every once in awhile.

39:02.808 --> 39:05.043
Sometimes the consequences
are worth it.

39:05.043 --> 39:06.211
Until they're not.

39:06.211 --> 39:07.813
Don't make me take away
your pancakes, woman.

39:07.813 --> 39:10.416
I just think we are who we are.

39:10.416 --> 39:13.151
Some people are impulsive
and it works for them.

39:13.151 --> 39:15.120
Me, I'm cautious.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.688
I take calculated risks.

39:16.688 --> 39:17.623
Mm-hmm.

39:17.623 --> 39:20.191
Zoe, you moved to BlueBell.

39:20.191 --> 39:21.893
You took a plane,
a bus

39:21.893 --> 39:24.863
and Lord knows what else
and you came here.

39:24.863 --> 39:28.266
I have a feeling you're more
impulsive than you might think.

39:28.266 --> 39:32.471
I have a feeling that if you
ever truly let yourself go,

39:32.471 --> 39:34.906
you might fly.

39:50.489 --> 39:52.524
Hello, handsome.

39:54.359 --> 39:55.694
You feeling better?

39:55.694 --> 39:56.795
Much.

39:56.795 --> 39:58.864
I think it was heat,
it was just getting to me.

39:58.864 --> 40:00.365
Okay.

40:00.365 --> 40:03.134
And you're sure you don't have
anything you want to talk about?

40:04.503 --> 40:06.605
There's nothing to talk
about, George Tucker.

40:06.605 --> 40:08.840
Nothing at all.

40:15.380 --> 40:17.148
Lemonade?

40:17.148 --> 40:19.150
Yes, please.

40:50.682 --> 40:52.884
(water splashing)

41:06.164 --> 41:08.166
(Wade wolf whistles)
