00:00.034 --> 00:01.573
Previously on Rectify...

00:01.601 --> 00:03.265
Ted Jr. won't press charges.

00:03.284 --> 00:04.555
This is bigger than him.

00:04.573 --> 00:06.622
You did the right thing telling me this.

00:06.649 --> 00:09.274
You're pregnant. You make me feel, Tawney.

00:09.293 --> 00:10.976
Really feel, you know?

00:11.021 --> 00:13.124
What happened in that interrogation room?

00:13.143 --> 00:14.149
We put pressure on him.

00:14.186 --> 00:16.536
And now you think the confession
might have been coerced?

00:16.555 --> 00:19.052
Daniel choked him into unconsciousness.

00:19.089 --> 00:21.119
D.A.'s prepared to offer you a plea deal.

00:21.155 --> 00:22.957
No more time. Not one day.

00:22.966 --> 00:24.558
I'm worried that it
will be a deal-breaker.

00:24.585 --> 00:26.369
This is not a game, Daniel!

01:33.192 --> 01:36.040
The body has its own wisdom.

01:36.091 --> 01:38.710
There's a logic to how it works.

01:42.202 --> 01:45.303
It's important for you to
know it's nothing you did.

01:45.925 --> 01:49.646
Up to 25% of all pregnancies
end in miscarriage.

01:49.683 --> 01:51.472
It's very common early on.

01:52.116 --> 01:56.060
Usually it's due to
chromosomal abnormalities...

01:56.062 --> 01:58.619
something not right in the egg,

01:58.739 --> 02:00.565
the sperm, the division process.

02:00.915 --> 02:04.299
It's nature's way of
preventing serious defects.

02:04.987 --> 02:07.545
You may continue to have some bleeding

02:07.554 --> 02:08.935
for the next three, four days.

02:10.573 --> 02:13.198
Use ibuprofen for any cramping.

02:13.618 --> 02:15.539
Tawney, watch out for

02:16.033 --> 02:20.487
fever, chills, any back aches.

02:20.735 --> 02:22.235
They may be signs of infection.

02:22.262 --> 02:24.704
I'd need to know right away.

02:26.771 --> 02:29.761
The best news is, Tawney, you're young.

02:29.789 --> 02:32.615
So there's no reason you
can't start trying again.

02:32.880 --> 02:34.430
Soon as you're ready.

03:11.083 --> 03:13.397
Tell me his exact words.

03:13.517 --> 03:15.867
I don't recall his exact words, Ted.

03:16.776 --> 03:19.778
He said it was late, Daniel
had come to the store...

03:19.812 --> 03:21.885
- Were they drinking?
- I don't know.

03:22.005 --> 03:24.616
I'd say it's quite possible,
though, considering.

03:24.651 --> 03:27.452
- He said they were arguing.
- About what?

03:29.976 --> 03:32.094
About Teddy's wife.

03:32.512 --> 03:35.263
I guess Daniel overstepped his boundaries.

03:35.530 --> 03:37.131
Anyhow, they argued,

03:37.158 --> 03:39.651
then Daniel rushed up behind
him and choked him out.

03:39.984 --> 03:42.225
When Teddy regained
consciousness, his pants were...

03:42.238 --> 03:43.772
I... I know the rest.

03:44.347 --> 03:46.186
But what I don't know, Carl,

03:46.306 --> 03:48.463
is why you felt compelled to share this

03:48.490 --> 03:50.713
very private information with the senator,

03:51.143 --> 03:52.670
who then called me down to the store...

03:52.698 --> 03:54.032
the family store, Carl...

03:54.417 --> 03:56.201
to tell me all the juicy details.

03:56.321 --> 03:57.609
I told him he shouldn't.

03:57.655 --> 03:59.448
And now, he wants me to convince my son

03:59.475 --> 04:01.721
to press charges against my wife's son.

04:01.841 --> 04:03.792
Tell me why you did that.

04:05.428 --> 04:08.630
I suppose I was... seeking counsel.

04:08.632 --> 04:10.298
From the man who put him on death row...

04:10.300 --> 04:11.633
made his whole career out of it.

04:11.684 --> 04:13.305
It's assault, Ted,

04:13.351 --> 04:16.103
sexual assault. That's
a very serious crime.

04:17.906 --> 04:19.808
If Janet finds out about this,

04:20.685 --> 04:23.028
I don't know if she
could come back from it.

04:23.970 --> 04:25.597
But if I don't tell her now

04:25.598 --> 04:27.409
and she hears it from somewhere else...

04:28.708 --> 04:30.368
You see my dilemma.

04:31.260 --> 04:33.955
He wasn't even out a week, Ted.

04:34.006 --> 04:36.975
Not seven days before he did this to Teddy.

04:37.544 --> 04:39.211
That ain't right.

04:40.891 --> 04:43.431
Surely you can appreciate my dilemma.

04:44.366 --> 04:45.967
Well, I could appreciate it more

04:46.003 --> 04:47.814
if you would have come to me first.

05:01.651 --> 05:03.485
A merry-go-round, Daniel?

05:04.193 --> 05:06.738
It's a metaphor.

05:08.658 --> 05:11.026
You asked for somewhere private.

05:12.295 --> 05:14.663
Hiding in plain sight.

05:16.980 --> 05:18.524
I'll say it again...

05:18.644 --> 05:21.782
I'm your lawyer, first and foremost.

05:22.587 --> 05:24.983
How's my sister feel about that?

05:25.258 --> 05:27.187
I think she's getting the picture.

05:27.572 --> 05:29.620
I'm sure it's not a pretty one.

05:30.114 --> 05:33.105
She's been a part of this
for a long time, Daniel.

05:33.135 --> 05:34.907
It's hard for her to let go.

05:35.319 --> 05:38.017
As it always has been.

05:38.831 --> 05:41.559
So...

05:41.594 --> 05:44.337
I spent the morning on the
phone with the district attorney.

05:44.457 --> 05:45.699
And?

05:46.232 --> 05:48.617
We called their bluff.

05:49.251 --> 05:51.671
She's agreed to time served.

05:52.655 --> 05:54.456
That's good news.

05:54.490 --> 05:56.875
And she dropped the rape charge, too.

05:58.828 --> 06:00.612
Well played, Jon.

06:00.663 --> 06:02.135
Not really.

06:03.282 --> 06:05.083
How so?

06:05.117 --> 06:07.843
That was the flaw in their case, Daniel,

06:08.120 --> 06:10.288
in the original narrative...

06:10.339 --> 06:13.577
how to answer for the
DNA which wasn't yours.

06:15.982 --> 06:18.546
Oh, so now they don't have to.

06:18.597 --> 06:20.793
Exactly.

06:22.018 --> 06:24.863
Truth is, we did them
a favor asking for it.

06:26.802 --> 06:30.397
A good deal is when everyone
walks away happy, Jon.

06:32.966 --> 06:36.195
Or at least equally unhappy.

06:36.735 --> 06:39.901
They were saying yes to
everything we were asking for.

06:40.988 --> 06:44.122
- Until now.
- Until now.

06:44.476 --> 06:46.975
So what do they want in return, Jon?

06:49.045 --> 06:51.046
Banishment.

06:54.417 --> 06:56.211
Banishment.

06:56.836 --> 06:59.254
This is the third time I've
called you this week, sir.

06:59.256 --> 07:01.551
And... and as... as I
mentioned before, your, uh,

07:01.552 --> 07:04.843
credit card was rejected,
uh, for your rim renewal.

07:05.147 --> 07:07.846
So I really need to get a
new credit card from you.

07:07.897 --> 07:10.198
Uh... so call me back when you can.

07:10.232 --> 07:12.510
Thanks. Again.

07:19.411 --> 07:21.606
Hey, there you are.

07:21.853 --> 07:24.981
I've been calling you for half an hour.

07:25.101 --> 07:26.792
I was in a meeting.

07:27.117 --> 07:28.877
Tawney needs me at home.

07:30.112 --> 07:31.703
Everything okay?

07:31.754 --> 07:33.706
I don't know. I'm sure it's fine.

07:34.590 --> 07:36.007
I'm sorry, son.

07:40.012 --> 07:41.796
That I was late.

07:42.523 --> 07:44.632
Ain't no big deal. Just
let me know next time.

07:44.683 --> 07:46.684
Got to function as a team here.

07:46.719 --> 07:49.304
Okay. Be back in a little bit.

07:49.355 --> 07:51.733
Take your time. I'll be here.

07:53.718 --> 07:55.374
They're shutting me out, mother...

07:55.666 --> 07:58.196
both boyfriend and brother.

07:58.230 --> 08:00.815
They're not shutting you out.
They just needed some room.

08:00.866 --> 08:02.233
Room for what?

08:02.499 --> 08:04.869
To discuss things, I suppose.

08:04.904 --> 08:06.240
Is that what I do, mom?

08:06.249 --> 08:07.621
Make people want to shut me out?

08:09.408 --> 08:11.576
Sometimes we have to
watch what we say, honey.

08:11.627 --> 08:13.319
Or how we say it.

08:13.439 --> 08:15.830
And that's better than
not saying anything at all?

08:15.832 --> 08:18.466
Of course not.

08:22.173 --> 08:23.838
As long as I can remember,

08:23.840 --> 08:25.673
I've had to follow you around, mom.

08:25.978 --> 08:27.268
Literally.

08:27.388 --> 08:29.511
Couldn't have started out that way.

08:29.631 --> 08:33.347
You must have come to me at some point,

08:33.350 --> 08:35.183
when I was in my crib.

08:35.919 --> 08:38.225
And even when I got you
to stop and look at me,

08:38.236 --> 08:40.337
to acknowledge my existence,

08:41.710 --> 08:43.857
I still couldn't tell
what you were thinking.

08:44.188 --> 08:46.228
Or feeling.

08:46.946 --> 08:49.548
So I always felt like I had to guess,

08:50.015 --> 08:53.124
or fill in the blanks,
or push for some clue,

08:53.161 --> 08:56.204
until you would just get mad at me.

08:56.893 --> 08:59.207
I'm sorry, honey. I really am.

08:59.258 --> 09:01.420
And I know that's your nature, mom.

09:02.461 --> 09:05.630
Just like it's Daniel's to be so...

09:08.100 --> 09:10.732
...maddeningly private.

09:11.601 --> 09:14.418
But because it's not my nature,

09:14.538 --> 09:16.768
or because I don't always
read between the lines

09:16.809 --> 09:18.534
or understand that language,

09:18.854 --> 09:21.963
or because I want people to speak
to me in my language sometimes,

09:22.232 --> 09:25.366
that does not make me the bad guy.

09:27.203 --> 09:30.822
No, it doesn't. Quite the opposite.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.328
I hate it.

09:38.797 --> 09:40.182
Hate what?

09:40.302 --> 09:42.642
The idea of a plea deal... I just hate it.

09:43.168 --> 09:46.087
But I also hate the idea
of him going back to jail.

09:46.138 --> 09:48.734
And it could happen. I
don't care what you say.

09:49.092 --> 09:51.259
I have lived in this world
for some time, Amantha,

09:51.310 --> 09:52.677
and one thing I have learned...

09:52.728 --> 09:54.149
it is not fair

09:54.360 --> 09:56.308
and it is not just.

09:56.902 --> 09:58.786
The world is...

09:59.627 --> 10:00.990
absurd.

10:01.403 --> 10:06.131
And if I could just have
him and you and Jared and...

10:06.408 --> 10:08.192
My family...

10:09.717 --> 10:11.701
...What else is there?

10:13.814 --> 10:15.516
I don't know.

10:20.205 --> 10:22.040
I love you, Amantha.

10:24.009 --> 10:26.010
So much.

10:38.557 --> 10:39.557
Hey.

10:40.604 --> 10:42.360
Everything okay?

10:42.394 --> 10:45.146
I made you some cookies.

10:45.791 --> 10:47.657
Thanks.

10:48.507 --> 10:50.538
Let's have them over here.

10:59.857 --> 11:03.331
You put the peanut-butter
chips in them, too.

11:03.382 --> 11:05.318
I did.

11:06.498 --> 11:09.003
Getting all exotic on me.

11:12.725 --> 11:15.160
Teddy, I'm not pregnant anymore.

11:17.867 --> 11:20.348
I went to the doctor this morning and...

11:20.350 --> 11:22.111
It's gone.

11:23.569 --> 11:25.614
I'd been spotting a little bit,

11:26.071 --> 11:27.955
and I had some cramps,

11:28.248 --> 11:30.261
but I didn't think it was...

11:33.608 --> 11:36.911
I didn't want to worry you, 'cause I...

11:40.560 --> 11:44.255
It wasn't till this morning
the bleeding got heavy, so...

11:44.289 --> 11:46.304
You'd already left for work,

11:46.669 --> 11:48.334
so I...

11:54.383 --> 11:56.516
And you went to the doctor?

11:57.019 --> 11:59.087
She did an ultrasound.

12:00.022 --> 12:01.606
An exam.

12:01.640 --> 12:03.102
But...

12:04.060 --> 12:05.992
I mean, she said it's pretty common...

12:06.695 --> 12:09.063
this early on.

12:09.276 --> 12:11.899
One in five or something.

12:11.950 --> 12:13.712
Chromosomes.

12:14.953 --> 12:17.243
Chromosomes?

12:19.237 --> 12:22.009
It's nothing we did, Teddy. It's...

12:24.046 --> 12:27.048
it's just nature's way.

12:33.834 --> 12:37.108
She said I should just, you know...

12:38.672 --> 12:41.617
take it easy for a few days.

12:46.154 --> 12:48.002
Why aren't you...

12:52.942 --> 12:54.992
You must be in shock.

12:56.037 --> 12:58.690
I don't know. Um...

12:59.282 --> 13:02.677
Maybe, I guess.

13:04.536 --> 13:05.997
You want me to stay?

13:06.025 --> 13:09.791
No, it's okay. I'm okay, I think.

13:09.842 --> 13:12.043
I'm just gonna take it slow today,

13:12.094 --> 13:13.377
maybe lay in bed.

13:14.347 --> 13:16.881
Do you want to take
some cookies to your dad?

13:16.932 --> 13:19.550
I'll wrap them up for you.

13:29.458 --> 13:31.644
Just a few.

14:23.494 --> 14:25.271
I don't know what to tell you, Sheriff.

14:25.278 --> 14:27.000
I ain't seen him.

14:27.381 --> 14:29.503
George hasn't used his bank card

14:29.537 --> 14:31.735
or his cellphone in over a month.

14:31.855 --> 14:33.957
And we believe your son's missing...

14:34.008 --> 14:35.792
as in officially.

14:36.071 --> 14:38.631
Phone records show he was
in Paulie six weeks ago,

14:38.640 --> 14:40.415
but his phone hasn't pinged since.

14:40.535 --> 14:43.550
- Pinged?
- Registered... on a cell tower.

14:43.601 --> 14:45.469
It's a way to track someone's whereabouts.

14:45.520 --> 14:47.688
Yeah, of course it is.

14:47.722 --> 14:50.974
It's imperative that we find
out what's happened here, sir.

14:51.025 --> 14:53.110
This 'cause of Holden?

14:57.281 --> 14:59.866
Something happened, all right.

14:59.901 --> 15:02.653
Way back. With that girl.

15:02.773 --> 15:05.594
- How do you mean?
- Well, they took George in.

15:05.714 --> 15:07.741
Never even gave me a call.

15:07.792 --> 15:10.597
Supposed to give parents
a call, take a child in.

15:10.835 --> 15:14.381
I woke up about 4:00
A.M., and he wasn't home.

15:14.415 --> 15:16.833
Sun come up, went looking for him.

15:16.835 --> 15:19.169
Ended up down at the station.

15:19.220 --> 15:21.352
I was there on that bench all morning

15:21.382 --> 15:22.723
waiting to see George.

15:24.034 --> 15:26.226
Did you see Senator Foulkes there?

15:26.260 --> 15:27.844
Of course I did.

15:27.895 --> 15:29.805
He was moving in and out of those rooms.

15:29.925 --> 15:32.265
God knows what was going on.

15:32.385 --> 15:35.768
They never even called
Lester Holden at all.

15:36.088 --> 15:39.189
Saying Daniel's 18, didn't need his daddy.

15:39.527 --> 15:42.116
Didn't need a lawyer either, I guess.

15:44.741 --> 15:47.402
George ever tell you what
happened in those rooms?

15:47.522 --> 15:49.515
He wasn't ever the same.

15:51.500 --> 15:53.704
Well, the way he is now...

15:54.783 --> 15:57.088
How do you mean, "the way he is now"?

15:59.439 --> 16:01.428
We need to find him, sir.

16:01.462 --> 16:03.880
I'm through talking, Sheriff.

16:06.326 --> 16:07.801
Good afternoon, sir.

16:07.852 --> 16:10.103
I need to speak to the senator.

16:10.138 --> 16:11.997
Did you have an appointment?

16:12.015 --> 16:13.799
Tell him it's Ted Talbot.

16:13.808 --> 16:16.552
I thought I heard a familiar voice.

16:17.478 --> 16:20.280
Well, the door is always
open to Ted Talbot,

16:20.314 --> 16:22.299
father or son.

16:29.907 --> 16:32.744
Woke up on the wrong side
of the bed, did you, Ted?

16:32.864 --> 16:35.295
I didn't say it before,
but I'll say it now.

16:35.329 --> 16:36.347
Will you?

16:36.375 --> 16:37.710
You're a vulture...

16:37.830 --> 16:39.375
preying on people,

16:39.585 --> 16:41.387
feasting on their misery.

16:41.669 --> 16:44.616
Little dramatic for a tire
salesman, isn't it, Ted?

16:46.390 --> 16:50.274
Don't ever contact me or my family again.

16:50.295 --> 16:51.795
This is a private matter.

16:52.396 --> 16:54.512
It'll be handled within the family.

16:54.558 --> 16:56.369
You want to talk predator and prey?

16:56.651 --> 17:00.270
'Cause you got both under
one roof... your roof.

17:06.160 --> 17:08.387
Look, Ted...

17:09.781 --> 17:11.579
I'm a politician.

17:11.999 --> 17:14.451
I never claimed otherwise.

17:14.453 --> 17:16.492
And having a case I prosecuted,

17:16.499 --> 17:20.295
a case as conspicuous and
sensational as Holden's vacated

17:20.313 --> 17:21.877
is politically damaging to me.

17:21.997 --> 17:24.117
I don't deny it, nor do I apologize

17:24.128 --> 17:25.627
for being sensitive to it.

17:26.298 --> 17:30.265
But beyond the less pure
motives I may harbor...

17:31.052 --> 17:32.918
Beyond my ego,

17:33.038 --> 17:34.803
my legacy even,

17:35.205 --> 17:38.818
in my heart of hearts, I believe
Daniel Holden killed that girl.

17:38.845 --> 17:42.028
I believe it as strongly
now as I did 20 years ago.

17:42.257 --> 17:44.323
And I also have to believe, Ted,

17:44.324 --> 17:46.300
that somewhere in your heart of hearts,

17:47.278 --> 17:50.203
you've at least entertained that notion.

17:55.910 --> 17:58.271
You can't just brush that off, Ted,

17:59.470 --> 18:00.805
or hope

18:00.925 --> 18:03.275
that it will just somehow go away.

18:06.731 --> 18:08.533
Don't call me again.

18:19.850 --> 18:22.480
- I brought you some more music, Daniel.
- No.

18:24.073 --> 18:26.313
I said, "no."

18:26.871 --> 18:28.855
I don't want to listen!

18:30.657 --> 18:32.212
Sorry, Daniel.

18:32.523 --> 18:35.075
You are, yes.

18:36.117 --> 18:37.955
I brought you a letter.

18:38.459 --> 18:40.480
Just a random letter?

18:40.827 --> 18:44.001
Charlie, I don't see the point in that.

18:45.794 --> 18:47.980
It's from your sister.

18:50.559 --> 18:54.199
My sister wrote you a letter?
She's an atheist, Charlie.

18:54.419 --> 18:56.824
It's not for me, Daniel.

18:58.553 --> 19:01.086
You know, the last three
times she's come to visit,

19:01.104 --> 19:03.610
you made her sit in that
cold, gray visiting room,

19:03.730 --> 19:06.546
phone in her hand, waiting
for a brother that never shows.

19:09.812 --> 19:11.796
I'm a ghost, Charlie.

19:11.916 --> 19:15.253
The sooner they learn that,
the better off they'll be.

19:15.739 --> 19:17.311
Or the better off you'll be?

19:17.329 --> 19:19.552
I changed my mind. Play some goddamn music.

19:19.561 --> 19:23.018
No, I'd rather talk. We
hardly do any of that.

19:23.138 --> 19:24.438
For good reason.

19:25.283 --> 19:28.017
What are you afraid of, Daniel?

19:45.686 --> 19:47.205
- "Dearest Daniel..."
- Don't.

19:47.224 --> 19:49.410
"... I thought for once
I'd write you a letter

19:49.428 --> 19:51.524
- that wasn't about your case.
- Charlie.

19:51.558 --> 19:53.409
"Or about justice row,

19:53.617 --> 19:56.069
or the appeals process in Georgia,

19:56.189 --> 19:58.419
or about any of that legal crap.

19:58.455 --> 20:00.888
I'm sure you're quite tired of that by now.

20:01.181 --> 20:03.558
I thought maybe I'd write you a letter

20:03.577 --> 20:05.378
as if you were just...

20:06.037 --> 20:07.308
my brother.

20:07.939 --> 20:09.576
Which you are.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.979
Not my brother on death row.

20:13.015 --> 20:15.403
That is not who you are, Daniel.

20:15.979 --> 20:19.427
I hope you know that,
and I hope you believe it.

20:20.625 --> 20:22.482
I love you, Daniel,

20:22.602 --> 20:25.390
even if you never speak to me again.

20:25.839 --> 20:27.303
I love you,

20:27.559 --> 20:29.361
always and forever,

20:29.955 --> 20:31.712
your sister...

20:33.266 --> 20:34.949
Amantha."

20:41.489 --> 20:44.608
I have to be honest with
you, Charlie Chaplain.

20:45.329 --> 20:47.178
Yeah?

20:47.443 --> 20:49.702
I thought you'd be funnier.

21:00.352 --> 21:02.474
Thank you, Miss Becky.

21:10.387 --> 21:11.938
You turd.

21:11.972 --> 21:14.171
I just wanted to see your

21:14.665 --> 21:16.430
home away from home.

21:16.705 --> 21:18.470
Ta-da.

21:18.690 --> 21:21.955
It's, uh, well-lit.

21:23.839 --> 21:28.588
Jon told me that your shift ends soon.

21:28.590 --> 21:30.132
Did he, now?

21:30.252 --> 21:32.556
Time for a chat afterwards?

21:35.479 --> 21:37.660
The entire state of Georgia?

21:38.099 --> 21:40.827
Apparently that's unconstitutional, so they

21:41.053 --> 21:44.989
banish you from every county
in the state except one.

21:45.007 --> 21:46.215
Which one?

21:46.544 --> 21:49.130
- Echols.
- Never heard of it.

21:49.907 --> 21:51.755
It's not convenient.

21:51.875 --> 21:53.758
Of course it isn't.

21:54.196 --> 21:57.324
So... what about Christmas?

21:57.444 --> 21:58.651
Or birthdays?

21:58.669 --> 22:01.184
Will they let you visit?

22:01.458 --> 22:03.837
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do.

22:07.330 --> 22:10.001
You still think this is a game, Daniel?

22:10.715 --> 22:13.568
You still think you can play the system?

22:13.824 --> 22:16.266
Because this is what it
looks like when you do.

22:16.284 --> 22:18.764
You will never set foot in our house again.

22:18.782 --> 22:21.389
You will never sleep in
your bed or eat at our table

22:21.407 --> 22:23.643
or help mom fix that damn kitchen.

22:23.694 --> 22:25.038
I want to know that you understand that.

22:25.065 --> 22:27.654
That you comprehend the
fullness of what that means.

22:27.774 --> 22:29.336
I certainly do.

22:29.900 --> 22:32.171
Then why in the hell would
you still want to do this?

22:32.208 --> 22:35.208
Name one person, Amantha... just one...

22:35.328 --> 22:37.320
whose life is better since I've been out.

22:37.339 --> 22:39.863
Name one person who's happier.

22:39.983 --> 22:41.930
We are happier because you're out.

22:41.939 --> 22:43.238
Bullshit answer. Name one.

22:43.257 --> 22:44.857
Just because things are complicated

22:44.875 --> 22:47.849
doesn't mean that you give up, that you...

22:48.269 --> 22:50.583
run away and leave us all behind.

22:56.793 --> 22:59.885
I haven't made my decision
yet, Amantha. I just...

23:00.005 --> 23:02.098
I wanted you to know.

23:11.659 --> 23:13.200
Have you told mom yet?

23:13.494 --> 23:16.178
- No.
- You have to tell her.

23:16.205 --> 23:17.029
I know.

23:17.074 --> 23:19.553
And you have to look her
in the eyes when you say it.

23:19.846 --> 23:22.233
I want you to see her heart break.

23:43.429 --> 23:44.993
Can I talk to you?

23:45.030 --> 23:46.877
Come on in.

23:48.808 --> 23:50.874
I haven't done much reading lately

23:50.875 --> 23:52.329
with all that's been going on.

23:52.449 --> 23:55.284
I thought I'd try to get a few chapters in.

23:55.319 --> 23:57.177
Yeah, I...

23:57.297 --> 24:00.150
I haven't read anything
since I've gotten out.

24:00.177 --> 24:03.022
Well, you'll get back into it.

24:03.726 --> 24:06.735
It's been nice having you
home the last couple of days.

24:06.945 --> 24:09.305
I always sleep better when you are.

24:09.890 --> 24:12.936
Not that I need you here
every night or anything.

24:13.777 --> 24:16.210
I sleep better here, too.

24:19.833 --> 24:23.262
I've been thinking about time.

24:24.086 --> 24:26.682
Yeah, it hangs over all of us.

24:26.734 --> 24:29.793
I was thinking about what you
told me the day you got out.

24:29.820 --> 24:31.577
Do you remember?

24:32.236 --> 24:34.623
Well, that was a big day, mother.

24:34.641 --> 24:37.065
Maybe it was the next day.

24:37.185 --> 24:39.150
You talked about the, uh,

24:39.525 --> 24:42.782
the concept of time, I
believe was the phrase.

24:42.833 --> 24:44.913
That's a familiar theme of mine.

24:44.941 --> 24:46.321
So...

24:46.441 --> 24:50.575
has anything changed
with the concept itself?

24:50.695 --> 24:52.742
Or do you still feel like you were...

24:52.743 --> 24:54.765
Always there?

24:56.346 --> 24:58.194
Not anymore.

24:58.314 --> 24:59.942
The world has a way of...

24:59.960 --> 25:01.570
Drawing you back in.

25:02.269 --> 25:04.804
In spite of one's best efforts.

25:04.855 --> 25:06.889
Always.

25:06.940 --> 25:11.209
I'm getting bits and
pieces as the days go by.

25:11.562 --> 25:13.697
Memories.

25:14.565 --> 25:18.097
The way the world was before I went away.

25:19.570 --> 25:21.371
And memories of the

25:21.682 --> 25:24.060
days since I've gotten out.

25:25.493 --> 25:27.627
I can imagine.

25:28.329 --> 25:30.213
Mother...

25:33.717 --> 25:36.335
...I can't live here anymore.

25:39.453 --> 25:40.953
I understand that.

25:44.740 --> 25:49.249
I... I might have to
move somewhere... else.

25:50.054 --> 25:52.018
Atlanta, maybe?

25:52.069 --> 25:53.154
Well...

25:53.191 --> 25:55.066
You could come home on weekends.

25:55.551 --> 25:56.995
I could at that.

25:56.996 --> 26:00.096
Oh, Amantha would love to
help you get set up in Atlanta.

26:00.132 --> 26:02.028
You're gonna need help, you know.

26:02.895 --> 26:06.791
Yes, I... I'll need some help.

26:06.911 --> 26:08.949
Is that why you came in here?

26:09.069 --> 26:11.291
To tell me you couldn't live here anymore?

26:13.340 --> 26:14.874
Yes, it was.

26:15.315 --> 26:18.761
Well, that's not the
end of the world, is it?

26:36.108 --> 26:37.108
Hey.

26:37.132 --> 26:40.200
How far does the code of silence extend?

26:41.413 --> 26:44.771
As far as it has to in
order for me to do my job.

26:44.822 --> 26:48.706
So, is that limited strictly

26:48.711 --> 26:51.445
to information regarding Daniel's case?

26:51.447 --> 26:53.947
Or anything regarding Daniel at all?

26:53.949 --> 26:56.357
Because so much of his
life is about his case.

26:56.367 --> 26:58.846
And so much of your life is about his case.

26:58.883 --> 27:01.038
Maybe that's part of the problem.

27:03.767 --> 27:06.941
Tends to happen when your brother
goes to death row when you're 12,

27:06.959 --> 27:09.136
and you spend the next 20
years trying to get him out.

27:09.145 --> 27:11.130
I'm a lawyer, Amantha.

27:11.883 --> 27:13.764
That hasn't changed
since the day you met me.

27:13.782 --> 27:16.627
- But other things have changed.
- I'm aware of that.

27:17.306 --> 27:18.555
But?

27:18.606 --> 27:20.524
But nothing.

27:20.558 --> 27:22.244
But this is hard.

27:22.364 --> 27:24.494
But I'm tired of apologizing.

27:24.503 --> 27:26.250
But you screwed his lawyer.

27:26.280 --> 27:27.979
What did you expect? Deal with it.

27:28.099 --> 27:30.365
I am just trying to do my job.

27:30.366 --> 27:32.067
You shouldn't have told
him about the plea deal.

27:32.113 --> 27:33.330
Are you kidding me?

27:33.450 --> 27:35.488
I'm obligated to tell him. You know that.

27:35.525 --> 27:40.258
He is unstable and broken
and... and reckless.

27:40.300 --> 27:45.165
And it is your obligation
not to give him stupid ideas

27:45.216 --> 27:48.550
like a plea deal, because
he's going to take it.

27:48.670 --> 27:50.315
And then he's gonna be gone,

27:50.343 --> 27:52.839
and we're gonna lose him forever.

27:53.175 --> 27:55.175
I am going to advise him against it...

27:55.177 --> 27:56.305
against taking the deal.

27:56.351 --> 27:58.583
Too little, too late, Jon.
I heard it in his voice.

27:58.610 --> 28:01.098
Nothing is final until
the judge signs off on it.

28:03.165 --> 28:05.808
There's still time to change Daniel's mind.

28:05.827 --> 28:07.281
Good luck with that.

28:10.510 --> 28:13.110
Leave a message at the beep.

28:13.161 --> 28:16.244
This is very frustrating, Mr. Anderson.

28:16.564 --> 28:22.202
Uh... very frustrating that you
will not return my phone calls,

28:22.204 --> 28:24.330
that you will not pay for your rims.

28:25.436 --> 28:27.906
The next step is gonna be repossession,

28:27.915 --> 28:29.845
and neither one of us want that, sir.

28:29.890 --> 28:32.954
So please call me back.

28:49.530 --> 28:51.008
Tawney?

28:51.128 --> 28:52.600
I'm up here.

29:09.336 --> 29:11.394
Taking it easy?

29:11.514 --> 29:14.303
Just doing some reading, planning.

29:20.559 --> 29:21.812
School?

29:23.670 --> 29:25.243
Yeah.

29:26.067 --> 29:28.709
How was the rest of your day?

29:29.359 --> 29:30.823
Weird.

29:31.399 --> 29:33.256
Sad.

29:34.884 --> 29:36.759
I'm sorry, Teddy.

29:52.543 --> 29:54.310
Any pains or anything?

29:54.963 --> 29:57.173
Not really.

29:57.293 --> 30:00.550
Uh... there's a little
bit of bleeding still,

30:00.601 --> 30:02.404
but nothing major.

30:04.124 --> 30:05.249
Okay.

30:05.468 --> 30:08.084
I had some dinner, and I'm... I don't know.

30:08.204 --> 30:10.197
I'm almost feeling normal.

30:11.688 --> 30:13.426
Normal?

30:19.855 --> 30:23.358
West Georgia, Kennesaw State...

30:24.242 --> 30:26.257
Georgia Southern.

30:28.214 --> 30:30.958
Just doing some research.

30:33.968 --> 30:36.116
None of those are close to home.

30:37.278 --> 30:39.005
You moving out on me?

30:39.007 --> 30:41.211
What? No.

30:41.331 --> 30:43.616
They have online courses.

30:45.125 --> 30:47.632
Online. Sure.

30:48.350 --> 30:50.485
I think I'm gonna get ready for bed.

30:59.430 --> 31:01.717
You never wanted it, did you?

31:04.013 --> 31:06.616
In your heart of hearts.

31:08.669 --> 31:11.037
Just tell me the truth.

31:11.088 --> 31:13.305
Why would you say that?

31:13.425 --> 31:15.263
'Cause I got this thing

31:15.519 --> 31:17.357
that's been bugging me.

31:20.181 --> 31:22.195
"Why isn't she happier?"

31:23.017 --> 31:25.218
"She should be happier."

31:28.953 --> 31:30.974
I know it's been...

31:31.770 --> 31:34.623
- it's been hard.
- Has it, Tawney?

31:35.921 --> 31:38.217
Has it been a hard day?

31:38.337 --> 31:40.696
Baking cookies and planning your life?

31:44.427 --> 31:47.382
With no... no baby now, holding you back?

31:50.830 --> 31:54.041
I think we both need to get some sleep.

31:57.571 --> 31:59.336
With who?

32:02.382 --> 32:04.007
Sleep with who?

32:04.888 --> 32:06.680
Unbelievable.

32:06.927 --> 32:09.186
It is, Tawney.

32:09.424 --> 32:11.071
Unbelievable...

32:12.316 --> 32:14.934
that I thought you wanted my baby.

32:14.986 --> 32:16.055
Teddy...

32:16.320 --> 32:19.860
And now he's gone and
got himself a plea deal.

32:20.442 --> 32:22.494
Out there in the free
world, just walking around,

32:22.614 --> 32:24.694
yours for the taking.

32:25.155 --> 32:28.114
You have no idea... I have no idea what?

32:29.829 --> 32:31.988
That you goddamn love Daniel?

32:34.402 --> 32:37.575
That you wish that was his baby inside you?

32:38.334 --> 32:40.484
Blind man could see that.

32:43.431 --> 32:45.697
Oh, there they are.

32:47.280 --> 32:50.042
There are them tears, finally.

32:50.162 --> 32:53.737
You can't cry for our baby,

32:54.525 --> 32:56.600
but the first mention
of that bastard's name

32:56.627 --> 32:59.252
and here come the waterworks.

33:00.697 --> 33:02.399
Go on, then.

33:02.450 --> 33:05.234
Why don't you run to him, Tawney?

33:10.124 --> 33:13.666
I can't do this anymore, Teddy.

33:15.614 --> 33:18.168
- I don't want...
- You don't want what?

33:18.872 --> 33:20.784
You don't want to be here anymore?

33:20.830 --> 33:23.190
Then go. Take off.

33:23.672 --> 33:25.588
The world's yours.

33:26.647 --> 33:28.504
Don't you look away from me.

33:30.909 --> 33:33.791
Don't look away from me.

33:34.641 --> 33:36.690
I'm your hero today.

33:38.053 --> 33:40.854
I'm giving you what you want.

33:41.803 --> 33:45.297
It's what you wanted since
the moment you set eyes on him.

33:49.163 --> 33:51.531
You should be thanking me.

33:51.582 --> 33:53.694
You have to stop this.

33:53.932 --> 33:56.118
Run to him.

33:58.005 --> 33:59.958
Lie with him.

34:01.209 --> 34:03.379
Give him your body.

34:04.478 --> 34:07.569
Let him dig into you.

34:08.775 --> 34:11.978
That rapist, that killer,

34:11.996 --> 34:15.380
- the guy who...
- The guy who what?

34:19.039 --> 34:22.112
Who loves you like you love him.

34:35.072 --> 34:37.994
I... I can't do this anymore, Ted.

34:41.174 --> 34:42.938
I'm tired.

34:43.158 --> 34:45.399
So tired of it all.

34:52.243 --> 34:55.087
It ain't Christian to get divorced.

34:56.349 --> 34:58.499
I know that.

35:00.804 --> 35:03.082
So maybe you'll get lucky, Tawney.

35:10.016 --> 35:12.662
Maybe he'll kill you, too.

35:14.315 --> 35:17.050
Strangle your throat until you're blue,

35:19.510 --> 35:21.587
put you out of your misery.

35:31.802 --> 35:33.549
I'm leaving.

35:36.053 --> 35:37.687
Go on, then.

36:23.182 --> 36:27.169
Tawney, call me back. Please.

36:27.582 --> 36:30.910
Let me know where you are so we can talk.

39:51.163 --> 39:52.891
What the hell, man?

39:53.011 --> 39:55.160
Think you can take a
man's product and not pay?

40:15.778 --> 40:17.708
You're sad, man.

40:17.828 --> 40:20.196
You're just a pathetic little bitch.

41:47.982 --> 41:50.470
Am I going to hell, Daniel?

41:51.120 --> 41:53.854
No.

41:53.974 --> 41:56.086
Am I a bad person?

41:56.562 --> 41:59.882
Of course not.

42:00.002 --> 42:03.852
But I called you just like he said I would.

42:11.507 --> 42:15.177
I lost my baby, Daniel.

42:19.232 --> 42:23.093
I'm sorry.

42:25.956 --> 42:30.637
Am I a bad person?

42:30.985 --> 42:33.198
Of course not.

42:33.436 --> 42:36.152
Are you a bad person?

42:38.741 --> 42:40.296
Yes.

42:41.457 --> 42:45.712
I don't believe that.

42:46.783 --> 42:48.996
I know you don't.

42:52.352 --> 42:55.206
We can't be together.

42:55.571 --> 42:59.055
No.

42:59.073 --> 43:03.300
Is there a God, Daniel?

43:03.609 --> 43:04.609
Sure.

43:10.400 --> 43:14.202
I want to dance with you.

43:17.287 --> 43:19.700
Will you dance with me, Daniel?

44:20.730 --> 44:22.715
- Next Thursday...
- Is Daniel around?

44:22.835 --> 44:24.380
He didn't come in last night.

44:24.398 --> 44:26.977
The shocking season finale of Rectify.

44:27.023 --> 44:29.566
- You shouldn't take the deal.
- I just want it to be over, Jon.

44:29.593 --> 44:31.048
If you say that you killed her,

44:31.066 --> 44:33.856
- you are a coward.
- Tell me how we make this right, Daniel.

44:33.874 --> 44:36.416
He's taken everything... taken off me.

44:36.453 --> 44:38.219
Walk us through the night of the murder.

44:38.228 --> 44:40.277
I want to hear it from the ***'s mouth.

44:40.295 --> 44:43.106
Did you kill Hanna Dean?

44:44.305 --> 44:50.550
