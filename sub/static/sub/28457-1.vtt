00:11.500 --> 00:13.210
<i>911.</i>
<i>What's the emergency?</i>

00:13.210 --> 00:15.800
<i>Hi, um,</i>
<i>it's our neighbors.</i>

00:15.800 --> 00:17.680
<i>I think something's wrong.</i>

00:17.680 --> 00:19.430
<i>Can you send</i>
<i>someone over, please?</i>

00:19.430 --> 00:21.020
<i>What's going on?</i>

00:21.020 --> 00:22.940
<i>Me and my mom</i>
<i>are outside right now.</i>

00:22.940 --> 00:25.730
<i>Their car is here, but nobody's</i>
<i>answering the door.</i>

00:25.730 --> 00:27.570
Dee?

00:27.570 --> 00:28.990
<i>Is that why</i>
<i>you're worried, ma'am?</i>

00:28.990 --> 00:30.740
<i>No one's answering</i>
<i>the door?</i>

00:30.740 --> 00:33.210
Gypsy, Dee Dee,
you guys okay?

00:33.210 --> 00:34.880
<i>Well, no.</i>

00:34.880 --> 00:36.420
<i>This morning, I looked</i>
<i>at their Facebook,</i>

00:36.420 --> 00:37.930
<i>and on their page...</i>

00:37.930 --> 00:39.390
Dee Dee!

00:39.390 --> 00:40.760
<i>I don't--</i>

00:40.760 --> 00:42.560
<i>there was</i>
<i>some real scary posts on it.</i>

00:42.560 --> 00:44.810
<i>And I'm just</i>
<i>really worried about them,</i>

00:44.810 --> 00:46.650
<i>and I just need somebody here.</i>

00:46.650 --> 00:49.280
<i>Ma'am, what did</i>
<i>the Facebook posts say?</i>

00:49.280 --> 00:51.790
<i>It said,</i>
<i>"That bitch is dead."</i>

00:52.960 --> 00:54.250
Dee Dee!

00:54.250 --> 00:55.710
<i>And then, um...</i>

00:55.710 --> 00:57.260
Dee Dee!

00:57.260 --> 00:58.930
<i>"I fucking slashed that pig</i>

00:58.930 --> 01:01.680
<i>"and raped her sweet,</i>
<i>innocent daughter.</i>

01:01.680 --> 01:04.230
<i>Her scream was</i>
<i>so fucking loud, L.O.L."</i>

01:04.230 --> 01:07.820
<i>Okay, we're gonna send</i>
<i>someone over right away.</i>

01:09.490 --> 01:11.790
Mom?

01:11.790 --> 01:14.210
Mom!

01:14.210 --> 01:16.840
You can't just go in there!

01:16.840 --> 01:19.090
Mel, be careful.

01:30.660 --> 01:32.580
Mom, they're here.

01:35.330 --> 01:37.290
- Dee Dee?

01:39.590 --> 01:40.590
Mom?

01:52.200 --> 01:54.830
How does it feel
to be in this house?

01:54.830 --> 01:58.630
- Well, Gypsy and I have always
loved fairy tales.

01:58.630 --> 02:01.010
But, you know,

02:01.010 --> 02:02.970
I really didn't believe
in happy endings

02:02.970 --> 02:05.560
in the real world--
not until now.

02:05.560 --> 02:08.820
It's almost like we're
in a Disney movie.

02:08.820 --> 02:11.700
- We love Disney movies.

02:11.700 --> 02:13.740
- Have you seen "Enchanted"?

02:13.740 --> 02:16.080
That princess
in the real world?

02:16.080 --> 02:17.880
No, no, I didn't.

02:17.880 --> 02:19.550
- Oh, God.

02:19.550 --> 02:22.800
I got off track.
What was the question?

02:22.800 --> 02:25.060
- How did it feel, Dee Dee,
when you found out

02:25.060 --> 02:27.350
that Habitat for Humanity
was gonna build this house

02:27.350 --> 02:29.360
just for you and Gypsy?

02:29.360 --> 02:34.120
- Getting this house has been
a dream come true.

02:34.120 --> 02:36.040
I don't like
to dwell on the past,

02:36.040 --> 02:38.630
but when we were homeless
after Katrina...

02:38.630 --> 02:40.550
If it wasn't for her,

02:40.550 --> 02:42.300
I tell you...

02:42.300 --> 02:43.840
I don't know
what I would have done.

02:43.840 --> 02:47.480
That girl, she is stronger
than she looks.

02:47.480 --> 02:49.900
I'm lucky to be her mom.

02:49.900 --> 02:53.240
I was born to be her mom.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.280
And are you excited to be here

02:55.280 --> 02:56.660
and make new friends, Gypsy?

02:56.660 --> 02:59.120
- Oh, yes--
- You bet she is.

02:59.120 --> 03:01.630
- It would be great
if we could hear from Gypsy

03:01.630 --> 03:02.760
on how she's feeling.

03:02.760 --> 03:04.180
- Oh, of course.

03:04.180 --> 03:05.260
Hon?

03:05.260 --> 03:07.310
Are you excited to be here,

03:07.310 --> 03:09.730
to make new friends?

03:11.020 --> 03:13.190
- Well...

03:13.190 --> 03:16.780
um, my mom already
is my best friend.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.500
But the funny thing is,

03:18.500 --> 03:21.210
a few years ago,
she had gave me

03:21.210 --> 03:23.380
this little glass house.

03:23.380 --> 03:25.970
And she said,
"One day...

03:25.970 --> 03:28.100
this will be yours."

03:28.100 --> 03:31.810
And now it finally is!

03:31.810 --> 03:33.150
That was great.

03:33.150 --> 03:34.570
My producers
are gonna love this.

03:34.570 --> 03:35.950
- Oh, that's good to hear.

03:35.950 --> 03:37.450
I get nervous
about these things.

03:37.450 --> 03:40.040
Are you kidding?
You guys were awesome.

03:43.920 --> 03:46.840
- Was I good?

03:46.840 --> 03:50.060
- You were perfect.

04:30.890 --> 04:33.860
There we go.

04:33.860 --> 04:36.230
Nice getting it all off.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.280
- I wonder
what it would look like

04:40.280 --> 04:41.750
if it grew in.

04:41.750 --> 04:44.920
- Probably be
a rat's nest like mine.

04:48.090 --> 04:49.930
Okay.

04:49.930 --> 04:52.180
Mirror, mirror, on the wall,

04:52.180 --> 04:55.190
who's the fairest one of all?

04:55.190 --> 04:57.990
- You are!
- No, you are.

04:59.990 --> 05:03.120
What's eating at you, huh?

05:04.540 --> 05:06.840
- I just hope that we get
to stay this time.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.430
- Oh, we will.

05:12.390 --> 05:15.690
- Yep, that's what you said
in Slidell.

05:17.070 --> 05:20.570
- Yeah, okay,
I was wrong that time.

05:22.410 --> 05:25.040
This is different.

05:25.040 --> 05:26.590
You know why?

05:26.590 --> 05:29.720
This house don't belong
to the government.

05:29.720 --> 05:32.140
They gave it to us.

05:32.140 --> 05:35.440
They even put my name
on a piece of paper.

05:35.440 --> 05:37.820
You know what that means?

05:37.820 --> 05:41.110
- That it's ours?
Yours and mine?

05:42.620 --> 05:44.250
Ooh.

05:44.250 --> 05:47.040
Just in time
for your medicine.

05:50.510 --> 05:52.430
We're gonna live
in this house together

05:52.430 --> 05:55.480
for the rest of our lives.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.400
And there are no hurricanes
in Missouri.

06:15.020 --> 06:19.440
Did you look
at the sky tonight, sweet girl?

06:19.440 --> 06:22.490
And what did you see?

06:22.490 --> 06:25.620
- I saw all the stars
hanging up there.

06:25.620 --> 06:29.920
- You remember that night
all those years ago?

06:29.920 --> 06:33.720
- The way the Spanish moss
was whispered in the trees...

06:35.060 --> 06:37.520
I thought it was
a couple of ghosts.

06:37.520 --> 06:40.020
- And I told you
to look at the stars

06:40.020 --> 06:42.820
and not those ghosts.

06:42.820 --> 06:45.280
- Because the stars are angels

06:45.280 --> 06:47.710
and the angels protect us.

06:47.710 --> 06:50.630
- And you are my angel.

06:50.630 --> 06:53.510
And you protect me,
and I protect you.

07:10.250 --> 07:11.840
Okay.

07:17.100 --> 07:19.100
Power up.

07:19.100 --> 07:21.690
Good night, hon.

07:21.690 --> 07:24.110
- Good night.

07:47.030 --> 07:49.160
- Ooh...

07:51.000 --> 07:53.420
Oh, no.

07:55.300 --> 07:58.010
Yes.

08:13.380 --> 08:16.220
Sleepy baby.

08:34.960 --> 08:38.090
Why are you cheating?
Mom, he's cheating!

08:38.090 --> 08:39.970
- Mom, I'm not!
- Yes, you are!

08:39.970 --> 08:41.600
- Hey, Trey, Darren.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.559
Take it outside
or in your room.

08:43.559 --> 08:46.360
No--

08:46.360 --> 08:48.410
Mom?
Mom, let's go.

08:48.410 --> 08:50.120
Lace, I was working
until midnight.

08:50.120 --> 08:51.700
I got a fucking headache.
- Really?

08:51.700 --> 08:53.210
Is that why
you have a headache?

08:53.210 --> 08:55.630
- Just 'cause you saw
those people on TV

08:55.630 --> 08:56.630
don't make 'em special.

08:56.630 --> 08:58.340
- I'm just curious.

08:58.340 --> 08:59.680
I mean, the least we can do

08:59.680 --> 09:01.640
is help the new people
settle in.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.770
- If you go around
going out of your way

09:03.770 --> 09:05.400
trying to be kind
to everybody,

09:05.400 --> 09:07.610
people are gonna
take advantage of you.

09:07.610 --> 09:10.490
- Fine, I'll go be neighborly
on my own.

09:10.490 --> 09:11.740
Enjoy the couch.

09:11.740 --> 09:13.460
I will.

09:13.460 --> 09:16.130
- Mother of the year.

09:19.510 --> 09:22.180
♪ Shine through you ♪

09:26.860 --> 09:29.070

09:35.540 --> 09:37.460

You must be our new neighbor.

09:41.470 --> 09:44.810
Yeah.
We live across the street.

09:44.810 --> 09:46.190
I'm Lacey.

09:46.190 --> 09:48.980
It's nice to meet you.

09:48.980 --> 09:50.570
Well, come.
Come on in.

09:50.570 --> 09:52.660
Come.

09:54.910 --> 09:57.590
- Oh, hey!
You must be Gypsy.

09:57.590 --> 09:59.670
- Hi.

09:59.670 --> 10:01.590
- Cool hat.
- Oh, thank you.

10:01.590 --> 10:03.760
It's so good to meet you.

10:03.760 --> 10:06.230
Wow, you're a charmer, huh?

10:06.230 --> 10:09.900
- Um, I did see y'all
on TV, actually.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.700
Uh, that's sort of why
I came over.

10:11.700 --> 10:14.410
Um, I'm doing
this volunteer thing

10:14.410 --> 10:16.370
at Springfield Memorial,

10:16.370 --> 10:18.250
and sometimes we like to do

10:18.250 --> 10:20.420
the little girls' makeup
over there, cheer 'em up.

10:20.420 --> 10:21.550
It's fun.

10:21.550 --> 10:23.390
And, um, I was just wondering

10:23.390 --> 10:26.560
if Gypsy maybe wants
a makeover?

10:26.560 --> 10:28.270
I need the practice,
to be honest.

10:28.270 --> 10:29.690
- Well, um...
- Yes, please, Mom.

10:29.690 --> 10:31.860
Please?
Please, please, please?

10:31.860 --> 10:34.790
- Well, uh, I do have
a couple more boxes to unpack.

10:34.790 --> 10:36.370
Just a little touch, okay?

10:36.370 --> 10:38.880
- Oh, yeah.

10:41.380 --> 10:43.300
Man, you are being so good.

10:43.300 --> 10:45.510
You are sitting so still.

10:45.510 --> 10:47.890
Do you like wearing makeup?

10:47.890 --> 10:51.030
- Well, my mom lets me wear it
to conventions.

10:51.030 --> 10:53.280
- Cool.

10:55.370 --> 10:57.960
- Your necklace is so pretty.

10:57.960 --> 10:59.920
- Thanks.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.090
My boyfriend gave it to me.

11:02.090 --> 11:03.680
- You have a boyfriend?

11:03.680 --> 11:05.680
- Mm-hmm, I do.

11:05.680 --> 11:07.770
- Um, are you in love?

11:07.770 --> 11:09.190
- Uh...

11:09.190 --> 11:11.900
I mean, he's kind of
a dumbass, but...

11:11.900 --> 11:13.610
I don't know,
I'll probably, like, marry him

11:13.610 --> 11:15.240
or something one day.

11:17.660 --> 11:20.880
Now, open your eyes wide

11:20.880 --> 11:23.380
and look like, right here.

11:23.380 --> 11:25.930
- Okay.
- Hmm.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.310
So...

11:29.310 --> 11:31.310
these convention things,

11:31.310 --> 11:33.440
do you dress up as

11:33.440 --> 11:36.200
Xena the Warrior Princess
or something?

11:36.200 --> 11:38.330
No.

11:38.330 --> 11:39.710
- No.

11:39.710 --> 11:42.420
- Um, well, I'm mostly
a Disney person.

11:42.420 --> 11:43.840
I-I love Disney,

11:43.840 --> 11:46.180
so I-I-I go
as Cinderella sometimes.

11:46.180 --> 11:49.100
But, um, next time
I really want to go

11:49.100 --> 11:51.610
as Ariel
from "The Little Mermaid."

11:51.610 --> 11:53.900
- Oh, right,
'cause Ariel gets her legs.

11:56.820 --> 11:59.160
Um, didn't--I'm sorry.

11:59.160 --> 12:00.580
- No, no, no, it's okay.

12:00.580 --> 12:02.380
Um, when I was little,
I could walk.

12:02.380 --> 12:03.750
- You could?

12:03.750 --> 12:05.130
- Well, that's what
my mom says.

12:05.130 --> 12:07.260
Um, and that my dad

12:07.260 --> 12:09.980
made fun of the way I walked,
or something?

12:09.980 --> 12:11.520
I don't--
I don't really think

12:11.520 --> 12:13.570
he liked having
a kid who was crippled.

12:13.570 --> 12:15.900
But I don't remember that.

12:15.900 --> 12:18.910
I was too little.

12:18.910 --> 12:21.920
- I had a bad dad, too.

12:29.260 --> 12:31.850
- They're missing out.

12:33.020 --> 12:35.230
- That smells good.

12:35.230 --> 12:38.110
That looks really pretty.

12:39.410 --> 12:42.830
Beautiful.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.840
Okay.

12:47.880 --> 12:50.220
Take a look.

12:57.070 --> 13:00.450
Lacey?
- Yeah?

13:00.450 --> 13:02.250
- Can we be friends?

13:02.250 --> 13:04.370
- Heck, yeah, we can.

13:04.370 --> 13:07.420
I think it was, like, fate
that you moved here.

13:11.770 --> 13:13.890
Hey, Mama.

13:13.890 --> 13:15.020
Yeah.

13:15.020 --> 13:16.900
Yeah, I know, I know.

13:18.740 --> 13:21.120
All right.
- Bye.

13:22.290 --> 13:24.410
Bye.

14:01.360 --> 14:04.120
- Did you have a nice visit?
- Yeah.

14:04.120 --> 14:06.920
I think her mom was wondering
where she was, though.

14:06.920 --> 14:09.590
- It's funny she come over
and her mama didn't.

14:09.590 --> 14:12.220
You know what? Maybe I should
take a cake or something over.

14:12.220 --> 14:14.260
Start off on the right foot.

14:14.260 --> 14:15.940
- That's a good idea.

14:15.940 --> 14:17.480
Mom, Lacey said--

14:17.480 --> 14:19.730
- Didn't I say
you were gonna make friends?

14:19.730 --> 14:21.150
- Yes.

14:21.150 --> 14:23.700
- I worry about
making friends, too.

14:23.700 --> 14:26.290
It's so important
to make a good impression

14:26.290 --> 14:29.960
on the folks around here
so they accept us.

14:29.960 --> 14:31.680
We may not have family,

14:31.680 --> 14:33.760
but there are
good people everywhere.

14:33.760 --> 14:35.180
We just have to find them.

14:35.180 --> 14:37.650
Hmm?
- Mm-hmm.

14:52.970 --> 14:55.260
- Mom?

15:01.820 --> 15:04.160
- Here, wash all that stuff
off of your face.

15:04.160 --> 15:06.240
- But she just did my makeup.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.410
- Hey...

15:07.410 --> 15:09.920
you are far too young

15:09.920 --> 15:13.510
for all of that paint,
pretty girl.

15:13.510 --> 15:16.260
It's too grown-up for you.

15:16.260 --> 15:18.270
Now scrub.

15:19.980 --> 15:22.110
Scrub.

15:26.080 --> 15:28.160
- Girls wear makeup, Mom.

15:28.160 --> 15:30.920
- You're not like other girls.

15:33.090 --> 15:35.680
Aw, sweet pea.

15:35.680 --> 15:39.770
I know sometimes you want
to be like everybody else.

15:39.770 --> 15:41.690
But you know what?

15:41.690 --> 15:44.900
I like you special.

15:49.160 --> 15:51.210
- I know.
- Okay.

15:51.210 --> 15:54.970
Hey, put a smile
on that clean face.

15:54.970 --> 15:58.140
Oh.

15:58.140 --> 16:01.770
Aw, that's my baby.

16:01.770 --> 16:03.900
Mm.

16:19.640 --> 16:21.640
Ooh.

16:29.660 --> 16:31.460
- Mom, that's Lacey!

16:31.460 --> 16:33.460
We should go say hi!

16:33.460 --> 16:36.010
We should say hi.

16:42.100 --> 16:44.610
Hey, Lacey!
- Oh, hey, Gypsy!

16:44.610 --> 16:46.360
- Hi!

16:46.360 --> 16:47.820
- Oh, this is
my boyfriend, Luke.

16:47.820 --> 16:49.280
- Hello.
- He's the one

16:49.280 --> 16:50.280
who gave me this necklace.

16:50.280 --> 16:51.750
- Don't forget the rims!

16:51.750 --> 16:53.290
- Yoo-hoo, hello!

16:53.290 --> 16:54.710
- Hi, Luke.
Nice to meet you.

16:54.710 --> 16:56.670
- Hello.
- Hi.

16:56.670 --> 16:59.390
- You must be Dee Dee.
- Oh, yes, I'm Gypsy's mom.

16:59.390 --> 17:00.720
You must be Lacey's.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.600
She might be mine.

17:02.600 --> 17:03.900
- No, but she's wonderful.

17:03.900 --> 17:06.530
- No, she ain't.
She talks back.

17:06.530 --> 17:08.150
That's why she's here
washing a car

17:08.150 --> 17:09.819
and not at the high school
with her friends.

17:09.819 --> 17:11.740
- You're keeping me
from a charity fund-raiser.

17:11.740 --> 17:13.410
- Family first.

17:13.410 --> 17:16.170
- Well, you look awful young
to be her mom.

17:16.170 --> 17:19.760
- That's a lie
if I ever heard one.

17:19.760 --> 17:21.890
- Uh, no, no, I mean it.

17:21.890 --> 17:23.270
- I'm Shelley.

17:23.270 --> 17:24.390
Hello.

17:24.390 --> 17:25.980
- Don't be scared of Mel.

17:25.980 --> 17:27.740
She seem like she bite,
but she don't.

17:27.740 --> 17:28.950
- Well, there was
that one time.

17:30.910 --> 17:32.290
Come on up.

17:32.290 --> 17:34.960
- Oh, thank you.

17:34.960 --> 17:37.500
- "Sub-man-dig
old-yeller-what?"

17:37.500 --> 17:39.300
- Oh, I know it's a hard one.

17:39.300 --> 17:40.970
Submandibular gland surgery.

17:40.970 --> 17:43.220
That's when she had
her salivary glands removed

17:43.220 --> 17:45.440
'cause she was choking herself.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.150
She's got the epilepsy,

17:47.150 --> 17:49.650
paraplegia, a heart murmur.

17:49.650 --> 17:51.320
She can barely
take anything by mouth

17:51.320 --> 17:53.330
and, well, she's anemic.

17:53.330 --> 17:56.000
- Mm. When my kids got
colds at the same time,

17:56.000 --> 17:58.880
I was like,
"Lord, take 'em, please.

17:58.880 --> 18:00.680
Find them a good family."

18:00.680 --> 18:02.140
How the heck do you manage?

18:02.140 --> 18:06.020
- Oh, I sleep with
one eye open, I suppose.

18:06.020 --> 18:07.730
- Me too.

18:07.730 --> 18:09.740
Can't watch them forever,
though, right?

18:09.740 --> 18:11.320
Mel's a great mom,

18:11.320 --> 18:13.700
especially if you believe
in tough love.

18:13.700 --> 18:16.080
- I just don't believe
in spoiling them.

18:16.080 --> 18:17.790
You got to teach them
to fend for themselves

18:17.790 --> 18:19.250
as soon as they can walk.

18:19.250 --> 18:21.340
- Oh, Mel...

18:21.340 --> 18:24.060
Everything is different
with my Gypsy.

18:25.640 --> 18:27.770
- Of course.

18:27.770 --> 18:29.730
She ain't well.

18:29.730 --> 18:31.280
- She can't fend for herself.

18:31.280 --> 18:33.700
She'll never be able to.

18:33.700 --> 18:35.910
I have to do everything
for her.

18:35.910 --> 18:38.080
That must be
a burden to carry.

18:38.080 --> 18:39.880
Oh, it is.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.300
Thank God
I'm good at it, though.

18:42.300 --> 18:43.760
Lord knows her daddy wasn't.

18:43.760 --> 18:46.430
I am the only one she has.

18:46.430 --> 18:48.650
If I wasn't around...

18:48.650 --> 18:51.150
Who knows where she'd be?

18:51.150 --> 18:55.200
- Hmm.
- She seems lucky to have you.

18:55.200 --> 18:58.210
Anyway, welcome
to the neighborhood.

18:58.210 --> 19:00.460
Pretty much what you see
is what you get, I guess.

19:00.460 --> 19:02.420
Nice knowing ya.

19:02.420 --> 19:04.300
Yeah, yeah,
just get the top.

19:04.300 --> 19:06.310
Just get--no, no, no!

19:06.310 --> 19:07.600
- Put me down!
- Hey, watch it!

19:07.600 --> 19:09.060
Ah, stop it!

19:09.060 --> 19:11.320
So dirty.

19:11.320 --> 19:12.650
Knock it off!

19:12.650 --> 19:15.030
Yeah, just get the top.

19:20.250 --> 19:22.340
You want some?

19:24.590 --> 19:26.010
Wait, what?
Say that again.

19:26.010 --> 19:27.220
We all know us a few--

19:27.220 --> 19:29.060
- Oh, no!
She can't have that!

19:29.060 --> 19:30.860
- She can't have a Coke?
- No, she's allergic!

19:30.860 --> 19:33.240
Sugar! A sip, maybe,
but a whole Coke--

19:33.240 --> 19:34.450
she could go into shock!

19:34.450 --> 19:36.070
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

19:36.070 --> 19:38.790
- Oh, I have an EpiPen.
How much did she have?

19:38.790 --> 19:40.960
- Oh, she didn't have any.

19:43.300 --> 19:46.640
We've already gone to the ER
six times this year.

19:46.640 --> 19:49.640
And as fun as that is,
I'd hate to make it seven

19:49.640 --> 19:52.020
before the end of summer.

19:52.020 --> 19:53.570
- Sorry about that.

19:53.570 --> 19:55.490
- Oh...
- That's okay. Bye, Lacey.

19:55.490 --> 19:57.580
- You couldn't have known.

19:57.580 --> 20:00.080
Bye, Gypsy...

20:00.080 --> 20:03.250
Now, why do we carry
this around with us?

20:03.250 --> 20:05.170
In case I have a reaction.

20:05.170 --> 20:07.600
- Yeah.

20:07.600 --> 20:10.890
And how much sugar
is in a can of Coke?

20:10.890 --> 20:12.270
- A lot.

20:12.270 --> 20:13.900
- Mm-hmm.

20:13.900 --> 20:16.990
And what would happen
if you had all of that?

20:16.990 --> 20:20.160
- I know, but what if
I just had one or two sips?

20:20.160 --> 20:21.960
Just a little sugar.

20:21.960 --> 20:23.630
- Baby...

20:23.630 --> 20:28.220
do you know what
a severe reaction looks like?

20:29.970 --> 20:34.860
First, you start
coughing and hacking.

20:34.860 --> 20:36.780
And then your whole body
gets itchy,

20:36.780 --> 20:40.620
like you're covered
with spiders or something.

20:40.620 --> 20:45.460
And then your face blows up
like a balloon.

20:45.460 --> 20:49.260
It gets all red and puffy.

20:49.260 --> 20:51.470
And then your throat
starts closing up,

20:51.470 --> 20:54.730
and before you know it,
my baby's gone.

20:54.730 --> 20:57.400
- I won't--
I won't do it again.

20:57.400 --> 21:00.740
I won't leave you, I promise.
- Okay, okay.

21:00.740 --> 21:02.620
- I'm sorry.
- I believe you.

21:02.620 --> 21:05.750
I believe you. I believe you.
- I'm sorry.

21:05.750 --> 21:09.470
- Oh, you're such a good girl
to me, Gypsy Rose.

21:11.600 --> 21:14.730
Oh, we take care
of each other, don't we?

21:14.730 --> 21:17.190
Yeah.

21:17.190 --> 21:19.950
Oh, today's been hard.

21:19.950 --> 21:23.290
But tomorrow...

21:23.290 --> 21:25.210
Why don't we do something

21:25.210 --> 21:28.090
that'll cheer us both up, hmm?

21:28.090 --> 21:30.680
Hmm?
- Yeah.

21:33.020 --> 21:34.140
- Mm.

22:00.110 --> 22:02.410
I like the pink one.

22:06.250 --> 22:08.250
- Oh.

22:17.020 --> 22:18.610
- Mom.
- No.

22:18.610 --> 22:19.820
- No?

22:19.820 --> 22:21.570
- No, you're not getting
a laptop.

22:21.570 --> 22:24.040
You can use mine with me there.
- No, Mom, not a laptop.

22:25.830 --> 22:28.630
Can I have that necklace?

22:28.630 --> 22:30.380
- That blue one?

22:30.380 --> 22:31.930
Really?
- Yeah, really.

22:31.930 --> 22:33.760
Please?

22:34.890 --> 22:37.270
Nobody's watching.

22:44.080 --> 22:46.000
- Look how cute it looks
with what you're wearing.

22:49.670 --> 22:51.670
Now, Mom, now.

23:21.150 --> 23:24.450
Mom, what's wrong?

24:10.330 --> 24:13.550
- Mom, I want to go inside.
I'm really tired.

24:13.550 --> 24:15.380
- Oh, just a minute.

24:20.640 --> 24:21.980
- Hi, Mel!

24:21.980 --> 24:24.150
- Hey, Gypsy!

24:26.240 --> 24:27.660
- Hi, Mel.

24:31.540 --> 24:33.420
Ooh.

24:33.420 --> 24:35.760
Okay, you go inside.
I'll be in in a minute.

24:35.760 --> 24:37.590
Are you going over there?

24:37.590 --> 24:39.180
Can I please come?
I want to go.

24:39.180 --> 24:40.560
- No, no, no.
- I want to go.

24:40.560 --> 24:41.850
- Don't sass me.

24:41.850 --> 24:44.520
You want to go in, now go in.

24:50.040 --> 24:51.370
Mel?

24:51.370 --> 24:53.830
Uh, hey, Mel?

24:53.830 --> 24:56.420
Um, could I speak to you
for a minute?

24:58.680 --> 25:00.220
Mel?

25:00.220 --> 25:02.850
Um, can I talk to you
for a minute?

25:02.850 --> 25:04.730
- What?

25:06.190 --> 25:07.440
- Hey!

25:07.440 --> 25:09.450
How you doing, Dee Dee?

25:09.450 --> 25:11.790
- Oh, well, Gypsy's real happy

25:11.790 --> 25:15.460
we ended up in a place
with such good neighbors.

25:15.460 --> 25:17.010
I can come back.

25:17.010 --> 25:18.800
- How's that house
treating you?

25:18.800 --> 25:20.720
Like it was made
just for you, I bet.

25:20.720 --> 25:22.770
- Oh, it was.

25:24.140 --> 25:26.530
That's a joke, Dee Dee.

25:26.530 --> 25:29.530
I should know.
I helped build it.

25:29.530 --> 25:30.740
We all did.

25:30.740 --> 25:33.660
That's how Habitat works.

25:33.660 --> 25:35.710
You need something?

25:37.250 --> 25:39.170
- Well, Gypsy and I
were just thinking

25:39.170 --> 25:40.930
of whipping
something up tonight,

25:40.930 --> 25:42.850
and I looked in the fridge,

25:42.850 --> 25:45.020
and, dang it,
we don't have any butter.

25:45.020 --> 25:47.020
So I was wondering
if you have any butter

25:47.020 --> 25:49.570
I could borrow.

25:49.570 --> 25:52.330
- No, sorry.
I'm watching my figure.

25:52.330 --> 25:55.460
You might have to go down
to the store, you know...

25:55.460 --> 25:58.000
pick some up.

26:33.160 --> 26:35.200
Did y'all see
"Nancy Grace" last night?

26:35.200 --> 26:37.880
Do you believe
that Casey Anthony shit?

26:37.880 --> 26:40.000
Car smells like a dead body
for a month

26:40.000 --> 26:41.880
and nobody notices?

26:41.880 --> 26:43.510
I don't pay attention
to that shit on TV.

26:43.510 --> 26:45.560
Everybody always acts
all shocked.

26:45.560 --> 26:47.690
But personally,
if you keep an eye out,

26:47.690 --> 26:49.900
you can tell
if somebody's no good.

26:49.900 --> 26:51.360
Remember Tracy's boyfriend?

26:51.360 --> 26:52.780
Jake?

26:52.780 --> 26:54.450
Remember how I called that?

26:54.450 --> 26:56.830
- Maybe you shouldn't talk
about that right now.

26:56.830 --> 26:58.830
She don't know them.

26:58.830 --> 27:01.130
- Why, Shelley? Dee Dee might
as well get used to the fact

27:01.130 --> 27:03.050
that sooner or later,

27:03.050 --> 27:04.760
everybody knows everything
about everyone

27:04.760 --> 27:07.100
in this neighborhood.

27:51.110 --> 27:53.070
Gypsy?

27:53.070 --> 27:55.780
Oh.

27:55.780 --> 27:58.080
Gypsybug?

28:01.040 --> 28:02.420
- Hey, Mom.

28:02.420 --> 28:04.300
Did you have
a nice visit with Mel?

28:04.300 --> 28:06.140
Was Lacey there?

28:06.140 --> 28:09.850
- Oh, Gypsybug, I'm having
a horrible day.

28:12.480 --> 28:15.570
Oh, I don't feel much
like cooking tonight.

28:15.570 --> 28:18.280
- Let's get pizza.
Pizza always cheers you up.

28:18.280 --> 28:21.210
- Well, you know what?
Maybe we can swing it.

28:21.210 --> 28:23.500
- Yay!

28:53.400 --> 28:54.900
I like Lacey's mom.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.440
She's nice.

28:58.200 --> 28:59.870
- I like her, too.

28:59.870 --> 29:01.870
I don't think
she likes me, though.

29:01.870 --> 29:03.830
- Everybody likes you, Mom.

29:03.830 --> 29:07.090
- Oh, you're sweet.

29:07.090 --> 29:09.970
Well, I think on this block...

29:09.970 --> 29:13.310
Mel is the queen bee.

29:13.310 --> 29:15.900
- You and her
should be friends.

29:15.900 --> 29:17.570
And then me and Lacey
could be friends.

29:17.570 --> 29:20.370
Wouldn't that be fun?
- Hmm.

29:20.370 --> 29:22.620
Unfortunately,
your mama might have made

29:22.620 --> 29:24.290
a bad first impression.

29:24.290 --> 29:26.460
I don't know
quite how to fix it.

29:26.460 --> 29:29.340
- Why don't we
invite them over?

29:29.340 --> 29:30.640
You could make gumbo.

29:30.640 --> 29:33.690
Everybody likes your gumbo.

29:35.310 --> 29:38.860
You know what?
You're right.

29:38.860 --> 29:42.330
We should make a gumbo...

29:42.330 --> 29:45.500
for all our new neighbors.

29:45.500 --> 29:49.130
We should throw a party
they can remember us by.

29:49.130 --> 29:51.720

30:37.190 --> 30:39.150
because my mama gave me this
before she died.

30:39.150 --> 30:41.150

37:40.410 --> 37:42.370

being her mama...

37:52.770 --> 37:55.770

I ever done right.

37:58.900 --> 38:00.410
- 11 years ago,

38:00.410 --> 38:03.160
Lacey's dad
started acting real scary.

38:03.160 --> 38:05.170
Stuck the kids in the car
and took off.

38:05.170 --> 38:07.840
50 bucks to my name.

38:07.840 --> 38:09.720
I did some shit.

38:09.720 --> 38:11.140
I ain't ashamed,

38:11.140 --> 38:13.220
but I wouldn't put it
on my gravestone.

38:15.060 --> 38:16.650

38:16.650 --> 38:18.570

38:28.210 --> 38:30.380

41:09.780 --> 41:11.370

How?

41:17.800 --> 41:20.640

a homicide investigation.

41:26.190 --> 41:27.950

41:27.950 --> 41:30.450
Where is Gypsy?

41:35.130 --> 41:38.380
Did you look
at the sky tonight, sweet girl?

41:39.890 --> 41:42.560
And what did you see?

41:42.560 --> 41:46.650
I saw all of the stars
hanging up there.

41:46.650 --> 41:48.360
You remember that night

41:48.360 --> 41:51.330
all those years ago?

41:51.330 --> 41:53.200
The way the Spanish moss

41:53.200 --> 41:57.130
was whispered in the trees...
- Mm.

41:57.130 --> 41:59.090
- I thought it was
a couple of ghosts.

41:59.090 --> 42:00.800
- And I told you,

42:00.800 --> 42:04.100
- "Look at those stars..."
- "Not the ghosts."

42:05.230 --> 42:07.530
- Because the stars are angels

42:07.530 --> 42:11.320
and the angels protect us.

42:11.320 --> 42:14.540
- And you're my angel.

42:14.540 --> 42:16.960
And you protect me,
and I protect you.

42:19.880 --> 42:21.760
Okay.

47:07.290 --> 47:09.000
Gypsy knows better!

47:09.000 --> 47:10.710
She's always had
to be careful.

47:12.260 --> 47:14.100
Yeah, I tell her,
and I tell her...

47:14.100 --> 47:16.140
- No.
- And I tell her.

48:26.820 --> 48:29.330
It's not possible,
Mrs. Blanchard.

48:29.330 --> 48:32.290
The PediaSure you give her
has a lot of sugar.

48:32.290 --> 48:35.380
Your daughter does not have
a sugar allergy.

48:37.430 --> 48:40.230
Well, something's wrong
with her!

48:40.230 --> 48:42.230
Mrs. Blanchard,
we've checked everything.

48:42.230 --> 48:44.400
Look at my daughter's
chart. She's got--

48:44.400 --> 48:46.610
We've been here 15 times.

48:46.610 --> 48:48.030
I understand.

50:30.280 --> 50:32.580
- I was thirsty.

50:33.580 --> 50:35.830
- Get in bed.

51:06.350 --> 51:08.560
Oh...

51:10.360 --> 51:13.320
Bab--baby.

51:13.320 --> 51:16.580
My baby.

51:16.580 --> 51:18.580
Baby, it's okay.
