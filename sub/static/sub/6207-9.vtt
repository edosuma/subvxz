WEBVTT

00:03.069 --> 00:06.538
Why are we even here? Following
Dad's orders like a good soldier?

00:06.539 --> 00:09.140
- Are you that desperate for his approval?
- This isn't you talking, Sam.

00:09.141 --> 00:12.277
The difference between you and me.
I have a mind of my own.

00:12.278 --> 00:13.712
I'm not pathetic like you.

00:13.713 --> 00:17.282
Before Dad died, he told me
that I might have to kill you, Sam.

00:17.283 --> 00:19.517
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Don't know.

00:19.518 --> 00:23.154
We're talking about the Colt?
- If you are set on the insane task...

00:23.155 --> 00:25.724
...of killing the devil,
this is how we do it.

00:25.725 --> 00:27.392
- You are LARPing.
- Excuse me?

00:27.393 --> 00:30.195
- Live Action Role Playing. You're fans.
- Fans of what?

00:30.196 --> 00:32.097
Supernatural by Carver Edlund.

00:32.098 --> 00:33.932
His name's Chuck Shurley, a genius.

00:33.933 --> 00:35.267
I'm Dean. This is Sam.

00:35.268 --> 00:37.302
The Dean and Sam
you've been writing.

00:37.303 --> 00:39.771
I write things and they come
to life. I'm a god.

00:39.772 --> 00:41.773
- He's a prophet of the Lord.
- You.

00:41.774 --> 00:43.975
- You're-
- Carver Edlund. Yeah. Hi, Becky.

00:43.976 --> 00:48.446
I am your number one fan, but I know
that Supernatural's just a book, okay?

00:48.447 --> 00:50.682
- Becky, it's all real.
- I knew it.

00:50.683 --> 00:54.619
- You okay, lady?
- Sam, is it really you?

00:56.322 --> 00:58.822
- And you're so firm.
- Uh...

01:20.179 --> 01:22.679
Dean. Come on.

01:27.386 --> 01:29.687
Chuck. There you are.

01:29.688 --> 01:31.689
- Guys?
- What's going on?

01:31.690 --> 01:34.190
Uh- Nothing. You know, just-

01:34.226 --> 01:35.860
I'm just kind of hanging.

01:35.861 --> 01:38.696
- What are you guys doing here?
- You told us to come.

01:38.697 --> 01:39.898
Uh- No, I didn't.

01:39.899 --> 01:43.468
Yeah, you did. You texted me.
This address. "Life or death situation. "

01:43.469 --> 01:46.271
- Any of this ringing a bell?
- I didn't send you a text.

01:46.272 --> 01:47.605
We drove all night.

01:47.606 --> 01:50.776
I'm sorry.
I don't understand what could-

01:51.243 --> 01:53.411
- Oh, no.
- What?

01:53.412 --> 01:55.912
Sam? You made it.

01:57.550 --> 01:59.250
Oh, uh...

01:59.251 --> 02:01.319
Becky, right?

02:01.320 --> 02:03.820
Oh. You remembered.

02:04.857 --> 02:07.951
- You've been thinking about me.
- I-

02:08.160 --> 02:11.596
It's okay.
I can't get you out of my head, either.

02:11.597 --> 02:15.934
- Did you take my phone?
- I just borrowed it from your pants.

02:15.935 --> 02:17.469
- Becky.
- What?

02:17.470 --> 02:19.070
They're gonna wanna see it.

02:19.071 --> 02:21.172
See what?
- Oh, my God.

02:21.173 --> 02:23.775
I love it
when they talk at the same time.

02:23.776 --> 02:26.766
Hey, Chuck.
Come on, pal, it's showtime.

02:27.913 --> 02:32.680
Guys, I'm sorry for everything.

02:47.199 --> 02:50.293
Ha-ha-ha.
Hey, Dean. Looking good.

02:50.469 --> 02:52.904
Who the hell are you?

02:52.905 --> 02:56.136
I'm Dean too. Duh.

03:02.148 --> 03:05.845
Uh-oh. It's Sam and Dean.
I'm in trouble now.

03:06.519 --> 03:09.019
Have fun, you two. Aah.

03:12.958 --> 03:15.458
What?

03:15.928 --> 03:17.996
- That's right.
- Oh, it's awesome.

03:24.236 --> 03:27.171
Becky, what is this?

03:27.339 --> 03:28.640
It's awesome.

03:28.641 --> 03:31.631
A Supernatural convention.
The first ever.

03:54.266 --> 03:57.916
Welcome to the first annual
Supernatural convention.

03:58.037 --> 04:02.497
At 3:45 in the Magnolia Room,
we have the panel:

04:02.675 --> 04:06.270
Frightened Little Boy:
The Secret Life of Dean.

04:06.478 --> 04:10.915
And at 4:30, there's The Homoerotic
Subtext of Supernatural.

04:11.083 --> 04:14.352
Oh, and of course,
the big hunt starts at 7 p. m. sharp.

04:14.353 --> 04:15.553
Yeah!

04:17.423 --> 04:18.890
Okay. But right now-

04:18.891 --> 04:22.193
Right now,
I'd like to introduce the man himself.

04:22.194 --> 04:26.392
The creator and the writer
of the Supernatural books...

04:26.565 --> 04:30.057
...the one, the only Carver Edlund!

04:44.783 --> 04:46.251
Okay.

04:46.252 --> 04:49.782
Okay, good.
This isn't nearly as awkward as I-

04:49.955 --> 04:53.447
Ahem. Dry mouth. Ahem.

05:10.242 --> 05:12.802
Okay. Uh... Ahem.

05:13.045 --> 05:15.809
So I guess, questions?

05:19.184 --> 05:22.779
- You.
- Hey, Mr. Edlund. Big fan.

05:23.756 --> 05:25.556
Okay, I was just wondering...

05:25.557 --> 05:30.047
...where'd you come up
with Sam and Dean in the first place?

05:30.095 --> 05:32.430
Oh, uh, yeah, I-

05:32.431 --> 05:34.931
It just came to me.

05:37.269 --> 05:41.137
Okay. Yeah. The hook man.

05:42.007 --> 05:44.876
Uh, ja. Why, in every fight scene...

05:44.877 --> 05:49.280
...Sam and Dean are having their gun
or knife knocked away by the bad guy?

05:49.281 --> 05:52.811
Why don't they keep it
on some kind of bungee?

05:52.818 --> 05:55.186
I- Yeah, I really don't know.

05:55.187 --> 05:56.888
Ja, follow up.

05:56.889 --> 05:59.324
Why can't Sam and Dean be telling
Ruby is evil?

05:59.325 --> 06:03.961
I mean, she is clearly manipulating Sam
in some kind of moral lapse.

06:03.962 --> 06:05.330
It's obvious, nein?

06:05.331 --> 06:08.499
Hey! If you don't like the books,
don't read them, Fritz.

06:08.500 --> 06:11.000
Okay, okay, just-

06:11.103 --> 06:14.004
Okay. It's okay. So- Next question.

06:16.842 --> 06:18.209
Yeah, you.

06:18.210 --> 06:21.846
Yeah, at the end of the last book,
Dean goes to hell.

06:21.847 --> 06:23.981
So, what happens next?

06:23.982 --> 06:27.509
Oh, well,
there lies an announcement, actually.

06:28.821 --> 06:31.321
You're all gonna find out.

06:32.358 --> 06:35.468
Thanks to a wealthy
Scandinavian investor...

06:36.128 --> 06:37.695
...we're gonna start publishing again.

06:42.868 --> 06:45.368
Yes!

06:45.437 --> 06:47.937
Sweet Lord, yes!

06:56.081 --> 06:58.914
I got you a Yellow-Eyed Cooler.

06:59.685 --> 07:02.185
- Thanks, Chuck.
- Sure.

07:02.354 --> 07:04.854
Ahem. So, Becky...

07:05.657 --> 07:07.558
...ahem,
I was wondering, are you doing-?

07:07.559 --> 07:09.560
Oh, hi, Sam.

07:10.896 --> 07:12.096
Excuse us.

07:12.097 --> 07:15.266
In case you haven't noticed,
our plates are kind of full, okay?

07:15.267 --> 07:19.170
Finding the Colt. Hunting the devil.
We don't have time for this.

07:19.171 --> 07:20.872
Hey, I didn't call you.

07:20.873 --> 07:22.573
He means the books, Chuck.

07:22.574 --> 07:25.042
- Why are you publishing more books?
- Um...

07:25.043 --> 07:26.277
For food and shelter?

07:26.278 --> 07:28.913
Who gave you the rights
to our life story?

07:28.914 --> 07:31.048
An archangel and I didn't want it.

07:31.049 --> 07:36.439
Deal's off, okay? No more books.
Our lives are not for public consumption.

07:39.224 --> 07:40.425
Becky...

07:40.426 --> 07:44.316
- ... would you excuse us for just a second?
- Uh-huh.

07:45.264 --> 07:47.231
You guys know what I do for a living?

07:47.232 --> 07:48.566
Yeah, Chuck, we know.

07:48.567 --> 07:51.702
Could you tell me? Because I don't.
I'm not a good writer.

07:51.703 --> 07:53.638
I've got no marketable skills.

07:53.639 --> 07:57.275
I'm not some hero who can just
hit the road and fight monsters, okay?

07:57.276 --> 08:00.478
Until the world ends,
I gotta live, all right?

08:00.479 --> 08:02.914
The Supernatural books
are all I've got.

08:02.915 --> 08:05.415
What else do you want me to do?

08:08.620 --> 08:11.120
No, guys. Wait.

08:14.092 --> 08:16.427
- Hey, are you okay?
- I think so.

08:16.428 --> 08:18.830
- What happened?
- I saw a ghost.

08:18.831 --> 08:20.031
- A ghost?
- Excuse me?

08:20.032 --> 08:23.334
- Could you tell us what it looked like?
- Leave this to grown-ups.

08:23.335 --> 08:26.504
A woman.
She was in an old-fashioned dress.

08:26.505 --> 08:29.307
Really old.
Like a school marm or something.

08:29.308 --> 08:31.642
Did she say something to you?

08:31.643 --> 08:36.808
Okay, gather close, everybody,
for a terrifying tale of terror.

08:37.683 --> 08:40.051
I saw a ghost.

08:40.052 --> 08:45.115
None other than the ghost
of Leticia Gore herself.

08:45.357 --> 08:48.659
I was on the third floor,
getting ice for a guest.

08:48.660 --> 08:50.528
Ooh. The LARPing's started.

08:50.529 --> 08:52.463
The- What is that again?

08:52.464 --> 08:56.834
Live Action Role Playing.
A game. The convention puts it on.

09:00.806 --> 09:02.039
"Dad's journal.

09:02.040 --> 09:04.509
Dear Sam and Dean,
this hotel is haunted.

09:04.510 --> 09:06.544
You must hunt down the ghost.

09:06.545 --> 09:10.014
Interview witnesses, discover clues,
and find the bones.

09:10.015 --> 09:13.965
First team to do so
wins a $50 gift card to Sizzler.

09:14.486 --> 09:16.187
Love, Dad. "

09:16.188 --> 09:18.688
You guys are so gonna win.

09:21.226 --> 09:24.389
Well, yes,
Agents Lennon and McCartney...

09:24.563 --> 09:26.797
...as manager
of this fine establishment...

09:26.798 --> 09:30.666
...I can assure you
that it is indeed haunted.

09:31.303 --> 09:36.172
This building was once an orphanage,
run by mean old Leticia Gore.

09:36.341 --> 09:39.110
One hundred years ago
this very night...

09:39.111 --> 09:41.412
...Miss Gore went insane...

09:41.413 --> 09:45.423
...and butchered four little boys
before killing herself.

09:45.817 --> 09:47.385
Now, folks say...

09:47.386 --> 09:50.721
...that the souls of those poor little boys
are trapped here...

09:50.722 --> 09:57.787
...and that the evil spirit of Miss Gore
punishes them to this very day.

09:57.963 --> 10:01.432
Well, that's just about
all the community theater I can take.

10:01.433 --> 10:03.534
Yeah, this cannot get any weirder.

10:03.535 --> 10:06.868
Dad said-
He said I may have to kill you.

10:07.039 --> 10:10.031
Kill me?
What the hell does that mean?

10:10.208 --> 10:12.076
I don't know.

10:12.077 --> 10:14.577
Oh.

10:15.747 --> 10:18.247
I need a drink.

10:21.553 --> 10:24.053
EMF's going nuts.

10:29.428 --> 10:34.127
Wooo. I'm mean old Leticia Gore.

10:34.299 --> 10:36.799
They buried me in the basement.

10:36.868 --> 10:39.368
Wooo.

10:39.972 --> 10:42.998
Ow. You got me.

10:43.508 --> 10:44.942
You're supposed to vanish.

10:44.943 --> 10:47.443
How am I supposed to vanish?

10:48.380 --> 10:50.481
Yeah, okay, Dean, we'll see you in five.

10:50.482 --> 10:53.017
Hey, but seriously, dude,
don't eat my Skittles.

10:53.018 --> 10:55.518
Help us.

10:57.589 --> 11:01.059
Help us.
Miss Gore won't let us have any fun.

11:01.627 --> 11:04.596
This is part of the game, right?

11:05.797 --> 11:08.297
Holy mother of crap.

11:17.776 --> 11:20.276
That was-

11:29.821 --> 11:31.789
Naughty, naughty, naughty.

11:59.784 --> 12:02.284
- How you doing?
- Busy.

12:02.988 --> 12:06.457
Well, you sure look lovely tonight.
Especially for a dead chick.

12:06.458 --> 12:10.690
Buddy, I have heard that line
17 times tonight, okay?

12:10.862 --> 12:14.032
And all from dudes
wearing MacGyver jackets.

12:18.203 --> 12:19.970
But you seem different.

12:19.971 --> 12:23.173
- How so?
- Well, you don't seem scared of women.

12:23.174 --> 12:25.643
For the last time,
I'm not making this up, okay?

12:25.644 --> 12:28.679
She's upstairs,
a real, live, dead ghost.

12:28.680 --> 12:31.348
- Excuse me.
- I'm sure it was just one of the actors.

12:31.349 --> 12:33.784
Who beat the crap out of me
and then vanished?

12:33.785 --> 12:37.121
- You saw something?
- Look, this isn't part of the game, jerk.

12:37.122 --> 12:39.590
I'm getting out of here,
you should do the same.

12:39.591 --> 12:41.725
Alex, wait. I-

12:41.726 --> 12:44.226
Hey, come back.

12:44.796 --> 12:46.230
What do you think?

12:46.231 --> 12:49.900
I don't think that guy's
a good enough actor to be acting.

12:49.901 --> 12:52.503
Why, yes,
Agents Jagger and Richards...

12:52.504 --> 12:58.254
...as manager of this fine establishment,
I can assure you it is indeed haunted.

12:58.343 --> 13:03.337
The building was once an orphanage
run by mean old Leticia Gore.

13:03.815 --> 13:06.150
Excuse us.
Mind if we ask you a few questions?

13:06.151 --> 13:08.319
I don't have time to play Star Wars,
guys.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.820
Go ask the guy in the ascot.

13:12.023 --> 13:15.186
Actually, we really wanna talk to you.

13:15.360 --> 13:18.056
Okay. You guys are really into this.

13:18.563 --> 13:21.031
You have no idea.

13:21.032 --> 13:23.033
- What?
- All this stuff they're saying.

13:23.034 --> 13:25.269
Place being haunted. Leticia Gore.

13:25.270 --> 13:26.737
Any truth to it?

13:26.738 --> 13:30.641
We generally don't like to publicize this
to, you know, normal people...

13:30.642 --> 13:34.678
...but, yeah, 1909,
this place was called Gore Orphanage.

13:34.679 --> 13:39.616
Miss Gore killed four boys
with a butcher knife then offed herself.

13:39.784 --> 13:42.019
- Is tonight really the anniversary?
- Yep.

13:42.020 --> 13:44.521
Guess your convention folks
want authenticity.

13:44.522 --> 13:46.190
Hmm.

13:46.191 --> 13:48.726
- There been any sightings?
- Over the years.

13:48.727 --> 13:50.861
Yeah, a few maids have quit.

13:50.862 --> 13:55.532
Saying they heard the boys or saw them.
A janitor even saw Miss Gore once.

13:55.533 --> 13:57.701
Where did Miss Gore
carve up the kids?

13:57.702 --> 14:01.105
Look, I don't want you
stomping all over the joint.

14:01.106 --> 14:04.396
A lot of this place is off-limits
to nerds.

14:10.715 --> 14:13.215
The attic.

14:37.809 --> 14:40.309
EMF's going nuts.

14:40.578 --> 14:42.780
Great.

14:42.781 --> 14:44.081
We got a real ghost...

14:44.082 --> 14:47.317
...and a bunch of dudes
pretending to be us, poking at it.

14:47.318 --> 14:49.818
No way this ends well.

14:50.321 --> 14:52.856
You know what? Serves them right.

14:52.857 --> 14:55.357
- Dean.
- Well, I'm just saying.

15:10.375 --> 15:13.277
It's gotta be around here someplace.

15:13.278 --> 15:15.679
Yeah, I don't know, man.
No one else is looking for the attic.

15:15.680 --> 15:19.283
Okay, all right,
dude. One, stay in character.

15:19.284 --> 15:21.952
All right? If it's just me, I look stupid.

15:21.953 --> 15:25.286
And two,
you heard the guy downstairs.

15:25.457 --> 15:27.825
I think this is part of the game.

15:27.826 --> 15:30.326
Help us.

15:30.795 --> 15:33.355
Oh, my God.

15:33.865 --> 15:36.855
- That makeup is amazing.
Amateur.

15:37.502 --> 15:40.699
- Stay in character.
- Sorry. Ahem.

15:40.872 --> 15:42.139
Sorry.

15:42.140 --> 15:43.407
Help us.

15:43.408 --> 15:45.342
Miss Gore won't let us have any fun.

15:45.343 --> 15:47.077
Where's the body buried, kid?

15:47.078 --> 15:49.708
We'll light her up nice and toasty.

15:49.881 --> 15:52.381
Yeah.

16:01.426 --> 16:04.395
Wow. Fast runner.

16:04.896 --> 16:07.396
Dude.

16:07.532 --> 16:10.032
Check this out.

16:11.302 --> 16:14.271
Oh, that is creepy.

16:14.439 --> 16:16.540
Must've been
what he was trying to tell.

16:16.541 --> 16:19.041
Gee, you think, Sammy?

16:33.458 --> 16:35.859
Okay, this is the coolest game ever.

16:38.062 --> 16:40.562
Ahem. Yes.

17:04.989 --> 17:07.489
My mommy loves me.

17:10.929 --> 17:13.429
I said my mommy loves me.

17:14.766 --> 17:16.266
I'm sure she does.

17:16.267 --> 17:18.767
My mommy loves me this much.

17:49.133 --> 17:51.101
Awesome.

17:51.102 --> 17:53.203
All right. So that was a guy...

17:53.204 --> 17:55.839
- ... with the County Historical Society.
- And?

17:55.840 --> 18:00.477
Not only did Leticia Gore butcher four
boys, but one of them was her own son.

18:00.478 --> 18:02.212
- Her son?
- Yeah.

18:02.213 --> 18:05.215
According to the police at the time,
she scalped the kid.

18:05.216 --> 18:07.784
I'm gonna deep-fry this bitch,
extra crispy.

18:07.785 --> 18:11.021
- Dude say where she was buried?
- Doesn't know.

18:11.022 --> 18:14.224
Check it out.
There's the orphanage...

18:14.225 --> 18:18.286
...here's the carriage house,
and right there, cemetery.

18:18.463 --> 18:21.064
You think
that's where Leticia's planted?

18:21.065 --> 18:23.565
It's worth a shot.

18:24.669 --> 18:26.336
Hey, hey.

18:26.337 --> 18:28.071
- Hey, you mind?
- It's real.

18:28.072 --> 18:30.674
A century old and he's right,
there is a cemetery.

18:30.675 --> 18:34.378
- Where did you get that?
- It's called a game, pal.

18:34.379 --> 18:37.714
- It ain't called charity.
- All right. Give me the map, Chuckles.

18:37.715 --> 18:40.980
You're the Chuckles, Chuckles.

18:41.252 --> 18:44.483
Besides, Dean don't listen to nobody.

18:44.655 --> 18:47.155
Dean, cool it.

18:47.258 --> 18:48.625
Dean.

18:48.626 --> 18:51.126
What? They're freaking annoying.

18:51.295 --> 18:53.764
Okay, guys,
we all wanna find the bones, right?

18:53.765 --> 18:58.255
We just thought it would go faster
if we all worked together.

18:59.137 --> 19:03.006
Ahem. We get the Sizzler gift card.

19:03.007 --> 19:04.207
Fine.

19:04.208 --> 19:07.677
And we get to be Sam and Dean.

19:07.678 --> 19:09.579
Fine.

19:09.580 --> 19:11.848
Yes.

19:11.849 --> 19:15.341
Hey, Rufus, Bobby,
would you hurry it up?

19:15.653 --> 19:18.588
- You all right?
- I'm trying to be.

19:19.457 --> 19:20.891
So where were we?

19:20.892 --> 19:23.693
Dr. Ellicott had just
zapped your brain.

19:23.694 --> 19:26.194
Right. Got it. Ahem.

19:26.197 --> 19:28.398
Why are we even here, Dean?

19:28.399 --> 19:32.135
You just following Dad's footsteps
like a good little soldier?

19:32.136 --> 19:33.904
You that desperate for approval?

19:33.905 --> 19:35.205
This isn't you talking, Sam.

19:35.206 --> 19:38.208
That's the difference between you
and me. I got a mind of my own.

19:38.209 --> 19:39.476
I'm not pathetic.

19:39.477 --> 19:42.145
So, what are you gonna do, Sam?
You gonna kill me?

19:42.146 --> 19:44.548
Man, I am so sick
of you telling me what to do.

19:44.549 --> 19:46.716
All right, you know what? That's it.

19:46.717 --> 19:47.984
That is it.

19:47.985 --> 19:50.795
What's wrong, Bobby?

19:51.489 --> 19:53.989
I'm not Bobby, okay?

19:54.158 --> 19:58.061
You're not Sam. You're not Dean.
What is wrong with you?

19:58.062 --> 20:01.531
Why in the hell
would you choose to be these guys?

20:01.532 --> 20:04.134
Because we're fans. Like you.

20:04.135 --> 20:07.229
No, I am not a fan, okay?

20:07.405 --> 20:12.365
Not fans. In fact, I think
that the Dean and Sam's story sucks.

20:13.945 --> 20:15.912
It is not fun, it's not entertaining.

20:15.913 --> 20:20.650
It is a river of crap that would send
most people howling to the nuthouse.

20:20.651 --> 20:23.954
So you listen to me,
their pain is not for your amusement.

20:23.955 --> 20:28.805
I mean, you think that they enjoy
being treated like circus freaks?

20:28.860 --> 20:34.025
Uh- I don't think they care,
because they're fictional characters.

20:34.198 --> 20:37.565
Oh, they care. Believe me.

20:37.735 --> 20:40.235
They care a lot.

20:43.407 --> 20:45.907
He, uh-

20:46.310 --> 20:48.880
He takes the story really seriously.

21:14.739 --> 21:18.329
- Found the four boys.
- And here's Leticia Gore.

21:22.980 --> 21:25.480
What are you guys doing?

21:26.517 --> 21:28.818
We're looking for bones, genius.

21:28.819 --> 21:31.588
They gotta be around here somewhere.

21:31.589 --> 21:35.582
Okay, generally,
bones are in the ground.

21:35.760 --> 21:39.127
Yeah, I know that. I'm just-

21:41.599 --> 21:44.099
Wait. Hold on.

21:44.502 --> 21:47.002
- Are you serious?
- Deadly.

21:47.038 --> 21:50.774
We're not really digging up graves,
you guys. We're just playing the game.

21:50.775 --> 21:53.765
Trust us.
You wanna win the game, right?

22:36.854 --> 22:40.924
That's not a plastic skeleton.
That's a- That's a "skeleton" skeleton.

22:40.925 --> 22:43.855
- You just dug up a real grave.
- Yeah.

22:48.499 --> 22:49.699
You guys are nuts.

22:49.700 --> 22:51.935
I thought you said you wanted
to be hunters.

22:51.936 --> 22:55.205
- Hunters aren't real, man. This isn't real.
- My God.

22:55.206 --> 22:58.736
You guys have seriously lost your grip
on this-

22:59.710 --> 23:03.077
- What?
- Naughty, naughty, naughty.

23:08.219 --> 23:10.719
Barnes!

23:14.025 --> 23:17.015
- Oh, my God!
- Naughty, naughty, naughty!

23:37.882 --> 23:40.382
Real enough for you?

23:57.534 --> 23:59.502
Aaah.

23:59.503 --> 24:02.563
- That was really-
Awful.

24:02.806 --> 24:05.306
Right? Exactly.

24:09.346 --> 24:12.336
- Round's on us, guys.
- See you around.

24:13.984 --> 24:17.215
Hey, how did you know
how to do all that?

24:18.722 --> 24:21.222
We, um-

24:22.960 --> 24:25.460
We read the books.

24:30.234 --> 24:31.767
Hey, Chuck.

24:31.768 --> 24:36.258
Good luck with the Supernatural books
and screw you very much.

24:39.109 --> 24:41.043
Fans of yours?

24:41.044 --> 24:43.544
Hmm. I'd say no.

24:51.855 --> 24:54.551
- That's weird.
- Definitely.

24:57.060 --> 25:00.230
- Uhn! Hey. Anything?
- Every exit's locked.

25:00.364 --> 25:02.732
- Almost like-
- Something's keeping us in?

25:02.733 --> 25:04.500
Yeah. This is bad.

25:04.501 --> 25:06.035
Gee, you think, Sammy?

25:09.940 --> 25:14.206
- Don't go in there.
- Get downstairs, okay? Go, go.

25:17.014 --> 25:20.844
Why'd you do that?
Why did you send my mommy away?

25:21.585 --> 25:24.820
Maybe because of the high-and-tight
she gave you, huh?

25:24.821 --> 25:26.956
- How about some thanks?
- Ahem.

25:26.957 --> 25:30.426
I'm just saying a little gratitude
might be nice once in a while.

25:30.427 --> 25:32.662
My mommy didn't do this to me.

25:32.663 --> 25:34.797
What?

25:34.798 --> 25:37.298
Then who did?

25:48.145 --> 25:50.546
Ja, how original.

25:50.547 --> 25:53.837
Supernatural bringing you
more creepy children.

25:53.850 --> 25:55.117
Sigh.

25:55.118 --> 25:57.486
Miss Gore
wouldn't let us have any fun.

25:57.487 --> 26:01.446
You look nothing like real ghosts,
just telling you.

26:01.625 --> 26:07.325
But Miss Gore is gone,
and now we can have all kinds of fun.

26:28.385 --> 26:31.354
Well, guys, I guess we're out of time.

26:31.355 --> 26:35.951
So thank you for your incredibly probing
and rigorous questions.

26:36.126 --> 26:38.626
And have a good- Hey.

26:39.496 --> 26:41.996
What? Holy crap.

26:43.367 --> 26:46.235
You gotta keep everyone safe.
This is life or death.

26:46.236 --> 26:48.404
- For how long?
- As long as it takes.

26:48.405 --> 26:51.335
How the hell am I supposed
to do that?

26:52.743 --> 26:55.678
I don't know, man, just do it.

27:01.752 --> 27:04.252
Okay. So good news.

27:04.321 --> 27:07.882
I got much more to tell you, I guess.

27:08.058 --> 27:10.426
It's awesome.

27:10.427 --> 27:11.761
Buddy, I got work to do.

27:11.762 --> 27:15.765
You're gonna wanna see this.
Trust me. It's gonna be a hell of a show.

27:15.766 --> 27:18.266
Here we go, here we go.

27:25.642 --> 27:28.144
What does the future hold
for Sam and Dean?

27:28.145 --> 27:31.774
Well, how do you feel about angels?
Yeah.

27:31.948 --> 27:36.285
Because let me tell you,
they're not nearly as lame as you think.

27:36.286 --> 27:38.254
Okay. New theory.

27:38.255 --> 27:40.589
The legends about Leticia
are ass-backwards.

27:40.590 --> 27:45.928
So all right, let's say those three orphans
were playing cowboys and Indians.

27:45.929 --> 27:47.596
LARPing as cowboys and Indians.

27:47.597 --> 27:52.068
Whatever, and let's say they scalped
Leticia's son and killed him.

27:52.069 --> 27:55.871
Mom catches them in the act, flips out,
slices them and dices herself.

27:55.872 --> 27:58.774
If that's true,
it means we got three bloodthirsty brats.

27:58.775 --> 28:00.876
Leticia was keeping them
under control.

28:00.877 --> 28:03.446
- Until we took her out.
- Smooth move on our part.

28:03.447 --> 28:05.948
Get back to the cemetery,
torch the kids' bones.

28:05.949 --> 28:08.117
How? We're trapped.

28:08.118 --> 28:10.052
We don't even have our guns.

28:10.053 --> 28:15.263
The ghosts are running this joint
and they're only scared of one thing.

28:15.292 --> 28:17.927
- Exactly.
- You want me to do what?

28:17.928 --> 28:20.229
You're an actress.
We just want you to act.

28:20.230 --> 28:22.730
I work at Hooters in Toledo.

28:23.100 --> 28:26.736
- No, you can forget it.
- You'll be safe, we promise.

28:26.737 --> 28:29.237
This is really important.

28:29.940 --> 28:31.273
We wanna help.

28:31.274 --> 28:34.276
Just give her the puppy dog thing,
okay? Guys, no.

28:34.277 --> 28:37.012
- Why not?
- Because this isn't make-believe.

28:37.013 --> 28:39.148
Look, we know. We're not nuts.

28:39.149 --> 28:40.516
We're freaking terrified.

28:40.517 --> 28:45.621
Yeah, but if all these people are seriously
in trouble, we gotta do something.

28:45.622 --> 28:47.490
- Why?
- Because...

28:47.491 --> 28:50.301
...that's what Sam and Dean
would do.

28:53.296 --> 28:56.232
No, there's really no such thing
as a Croatoan virus...

28:56.233 --> 28:59.259
...for down there.

28:59.870 --> 29:02.370
You really should see a doctor.

29:10.447 --> 29:12.947
Uh...

29:13.316 --> 29:15.816
I don't wanna do this.

29:17.120 --> 29:20.189
I'm right here, sweetheart.
I got your back.

29:20.190 --> 29:22.690
Trust me. This is gonna work.

29:26.263 --> 29:28.330
Boys.

29:28.331 --> 29:33.462
Boys, come here this instant.

29:46.383 --> 29:48.883
You come when I call you.

29:50.887 --> 29:54.414
- Do you understand me?
Miss Gore?

30:00.363 --> 30:02.863
Push it.

30:06.903 --> 30:12.500
You boys have been very naughty.

30:13.810 --> 30:16.310
Now you open the doors.

30:16.446 --> 30:18.946
Open the doors right now.

30:23.186 --> 30:25.521
Go, go, go!

30:29.593 --> 30:32.163
Very naughty, you hear me?

30:34.130 --> 30:36.630
Naughty, naughty, naughty.

30:42.839 --> 30:45.339
Damn it.

31:12.369 --> 31:14.869
Run.

31:32.923 --> 31:35.357
Oh, my God.

31:35.358 --> 31:39.419
Supernatural makes digging graves
seem so easy.

31:42.198 --> 31:45.133
It's not, though. I'm gonna throw up.

31:47.370 --> 31:49.870
No, you're not.

32:09.426 --> 32:11.427
Thanks.

32:11.428 --> 32:14.158
- Aah!
- Sam!

32:14.998 --> 32:17.498
Let's see. What else?

32:18.034 --> 32:22.095
I fell in love for the first time at 16.

32:22.405 --> 32:24.706
Lost my virginity, actually.

32:24.707 --> 32:29.497
But then she went around
telling everybody it didn't count, so...

32:30.046 --> 32:32.414
Ahem.

32:32.415 --> 32:36.784
Uh... Excuse me.
You really can't leave. Please, sir.

32:38.888 --> 32:41.388
Don't open the door!

33:08.318 --> 33:12.748
I said no one leaves, damn it.
Now, somebody salt this door.

33:27.637 --> 33:32.841
How come Dean can always light
the stupid thing on the first freaking try?

33:32.842 --> 33:34.843
Come on.

33:34.844 --> 33:36.912
Aah!

33:36.913 --> 33:39.413
Don't.

33:39.515 --> 33:40.849
Dean!

34:19.054 --> 34:21.625
You know, maybe that guy was right.

34:21.690 --> 34:25.041
Maybe we should put these things
on a bungee.

34:37.340 --> 34:39.641
You know,
I gotta hand it to you, guys.

34:39.641 --> 34:42.391
You really saved our asses back there.

34:43.413 --> 34:45.913
You know, thanks.

34:47.315 --> 34:49.184
Guys, I don't even know your names.

34:49.185 --> 34:52.052
Oh, well, I'm Barnes. This is Damian.

34:52.688 --> 34:55.188
What's yours?

34:56.993 --> 34:59.493
Dean. The real Dean.

35:06.169 --> 35:10.299
- Yeah, right. Me too.
- Get the hell out of here, Dean.

35:13.342 --> 35:16.834
Well, anyway, thanks. Really.

35:20.750 --> 35:23.250
You're wrong, you know.

35:23.686 --> 35:26.088
- Sorry?
- About Supernatural.

35:26.089 --> 35:30.639
No offense, but I'm not sure
you get what the story's about.

35:31.561 --> 35:33.361
- Is that so?
- All right, look.

35:33.362 --> 35:38.698
In real life, he sells stereo equipment.

35:38.868 --> 35:41.368
I fix copiers.

35:41.504 --> 35:44.004
Our lives suck.

35:45.274 --> 35:47.774
But to be Sam and Dean...

35:49.212 --> 35:52.802
...to wake up every morning
and save the world...

35:53.416 --> 35:56.874
...to have a brother
who would die for you...

35:57.854 --> 36:00.354
...well, who wouldn't want that?

36:03.292 --> 36:05.792
Maybe you got a point.

36:10.032 --> 36:13.142
You two don't make a bad team
yourselves.

36:13.736 --> 36:17.739
- How do you know each other anyway?
- Oh, well, we met online.

36:17.740 --> 36:20.240
Supernatural chat room.

36:20.776 --> 36:22.577
Oh.

36:22.578 --> 36:26.214
It must be nice to get out of your
parents' basement, make some friends.

36:26.215 --> 36:28.715
We're more than friends.

36:30.720 --> 36:33.220
We're partners.

36:34.891 --> 36:37.391
Oh.

36:39.462 --> 36:41.596
Well.

36:41.597 --> 36:45.124
- Ahem. Howdy, partners.
- Howdy.

36:50.273 --> 36:53.333
Look, Sam, I'm not gonna lie.

36:53.543 --> 36:57.070
We had undeniable chemistry.

36:58.548 --> 37:02.618
But like a monkey on the sun,
it was too hot to live.

37:02.685 --> 37:05.185
It can't go on.

37:05.254 --> 37:08.781
Chuck and I, we found each other.

37:08.958 --> 37:11.458
My yin to his proud yang...

37:11.994 --> 37:16.192
...and well,
the heart wants what the heart wants.

37:16.766 --> 37:20.361
I'm so, so sorry.

37:21.470 --> 37:23.305
Yeah, Sam.

37:23.306 --> 37:25.806
You know, sorry.

37:27.777 --> 37:30.277
Will you be all right?

37:35.985 --> 37:38.485
Honestly, I don't know.

37:39.021 --> 37:44.323
I'll just have to find a way to keep living,
I guess.

37:44.493 --> 37:46.595
God bless you.

37:47.830 --> 37:50.330
Okay. Oh, hey, Chuck, look.

37:51.000 --> 37:55.237
If you really wanna publish more books,
I guess that's okay with us.

37:55.238 --> 37:57.539
- Wow, really?
- No, not really.

37:57.540 --> 38:00.642
- We have guns and we'll find you.
- Okay, okay.

38:00.643 --> 38:03.635
- No more books.
- See you around.

38:05.348 --> 38:07.848
Sam, wait. One more thing.

38:09.252 --> 38:11.920
In Chapter 33 of Supernatural:
Time Is on My Side.

38:11.921 --> 38:14.723
There was that Bela?
She was British, a cat burglar.

38:14.724 --> 38:16.992
- Yeah, I know.
- She stole the Colt from you.

38:16.993 --> 38:19.427
Then she "said" she gave it to Lilith,
remember?

38:19.428 --> 38:21.129
- Yeah.
- Well, you know she lied?

38:21.130 --> 38:23.331
She never really gave it to Lilith.

38:23.332 --> 38:26.001
- Wait, what?
- Didn't you read the book?

38:26.002 --> 38:27.402
There is this one scene...

38:27.403 --> 38:31.206
...where Bela gives the Colt to a demon,
Crowley, Lilith's right-hand man.

38:31.207 --> 38:32.674
And I think her lover too.

38:32.675 --> 38:34.376
Crowley?

38:34.377 --> 38:37.646
- Didn't occur to you to tell us this?
- Sorry, I didn't remember.

38:37.647 --> 38:40.448
I'm not as big of a fan as she is. Heh.

38:40.449 --> 38:42.949
Becky, tell me everything.

38:54.697 --> 38:57.197
You okay?

38:57.600 --> 39:00.262
Yeah, you know? I think I'm good.

39:00.436 --> 39:03.705
You're not gonna believe it,
I got a lead on the Colt.

39:03.706 --> 39:06.675
- What?
- Long story. I'll tell you on the way.

39:06.676 --> 39:09.176
What are we waiting for?

39:20.089 --> 39:23.391
Like a lot of authors,
I started writing because of love.

39:23.392 --> 39:26.759
Yeah, I had a huge crush
on Nancy McKeon...

39:26.929 --> 39:29.197
...who played Jo in The Facts of Life.

39:29.198 --> 39:32.300
I must have written her
40 to 50 letters.

39:32.301 --> 39:33.635
She never wrote back.

39:33.636 --> 39:38.406
I don't think the Benders
made flesh suits out of all their victims.

39:38.407 --> 39:40.241
Maybe just, like, a couple scarves.

39:40.242 --> 39:43.143
Actually,
my favorite movie was Beaches.

39:43.312 --> 39:46.645
Hillary and CC were just so brave.

39:48.351 --> 39:49.617
So strong.

39:49.618 --> 39:52.120
Way I look at it,
it's not jumping the shark...

39:52.121 --> 39:55.171
...if you never come back down,
you know?
