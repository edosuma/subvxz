I established my current practice

first start seeing Thomas Grey?

00:50.521 --> 00:52.155

He had severe insomnia.

00:55.026 --> 00:57.820
For which you prescribed medication?

- Yes.
- Morphine?

No.

But Elizabeth's lawyers
will have pharmacy records.

If you don't talk about it, they can't
contradict your notes or prior statements.

If you don't contradict yourself,
you protect your credibility.

01:20.707 --> 01:24.056
Prescribing morphine for
pain management isn't a crime.

ridiculously suspicious?

And the Judge enters the
process long after we're done.

He'll review the depositions and
decide if it will go to trial.

all, "Savi, I wasn't finished".

out that you're best friends,

06:16.182 --> 06:18.339
Who she thinks is dead, April.

06:18.340 --> 06:21.327
But he's not, which means
Lucy could potentially

06:21.328 --> 06:24.081
grow up with a father
instead of without one.

06:24.082 --> 06:26.497
A lying dirt bag of a father,
but a father nonetheless.

06:26.498 --> 06:29.396
A child Lucy's age is
too young to process this.

might be dead again anyway.

10:36.127 --> 10:38.615
tell the girls about us some other time.

10:38.616 --> 10:41.008
Yeah, absolutely.

10:41.009 --> 10:43.413
Anyway, you seem to like the
candle. So you can just take it.

10:43.414 --> 10:47.303
- I'll see you on... on Monday.
- Okay. Uh...

10:47.304 --> 10:50.295
I'll see you next week.

10:50.296 --> 10:53.316
[Josslyn] Are you sure you're cool
with me and Alex using the house?

10:53.317 --> 10:56.663
Yeah, of course. [Huffs]
A couples' dinner?

10:56.664 --> 10:59.937
You've become so domestic
now that you're a lesbian.

10:59.938 --> 11:01.526
Oh, hilarious.

11:01.527 --> 11:04.082
It'll only be a few people,
though. Alex asked me to invite

11:04.083 --> 11:07.887
some couple friends, and then I
realized that I don't have any anymore...

11:07.888 --> 11:10.867
Unless you and Harry want to come.

11:10.868 --> 11:13.637
Uh, no. I don't think
that'll be happening.

11:13.638 --> 11:15.037
You never know until you ask.

11:15.038 --> 11:18.786
Harry won't come. Dom,
on the other hand...

11:18.787 --> 11:21.555
Um, Dom, on the other hand, what?

11:21.556 --> 11:24.028
- [Sighs]
- Hmm?

11:24.029 --> 11:25.829
Nothing.

11:25.830 --> 11:27.031
[Sighs]

11:27.032 --> 11:29.772
Did he say something to you?

11:29.773 --> 11:31.202
He did, didn't he?

11:31.203 --> 11:33.570
He told you he was into you.
I knew I should've warned you.

11:33.571 --> 11:36.607
What, did you talk to him?
When did you talk to him?

11:36.608 --> 11:39.346
Please. Does he realize
you're still married to Harry?

11:39.347 --> 11:41.904
- Do you?
- [Sighs] Of course I do.

11:41.905 --> 11:44.082
It's just, Harry won't even talk to me.

11:44.083 --> 11:46.338
I don't know where he
is or what he's thinking.

11:46.339 --> 11:49.987
- He's thinking that he loves you, Savi.
- He can't get over what I did.

11:49.988 --> 11:51.536
And I can't make him.

11:51.537 --> 11:53.991
So you immediately run into
the arms of another man?

11:53.992 --> 11:57.292
I'm not running into anyone's
arms right now. I'm just...

11:57.293 --> 12:00.593
Trying to stay realistic.

12:02.882 --> 12:05.066
[Dominic] A few points of
procedure before we begin.

12:05.067 --> 12:06.708
This is not a trial.

12:06.709 --> 12:08.634
These depositions are
simply to gather evidence.

12:08.635 --> 12:11.177
This evidence can be used if
the case ever does go to trial.

12:11.178 --> 12:13.732
So remember, you're still under oath.

12:13.733 --> 12:18.773
Anyone who testifies is
bound to tell the truth.

12:19.107 --> 12:20.845
Ms. Wade, anything else?

12:20.846 --> 12:22.446
That about covers it.

12:22.447 --> 12:24.649
Let's just try to keep things civil.

12:24.650 --> 12:26.589
Couldn't agree more. [ Intercom beeps ]

12:26.590 --> 12:30.043
- Bringing in our first witness.
- [Man] Yes, Sir.

12:30.044 --> 12:33.164
[Whispers] Here we go.

12:40.905 --> 12:43.190
[Dominic] Could you please
state your name for the record?

12:43.191 --> 12:45.831
Anthony Newsome.

12:54.142 --> 12:56.478
And in your investigative
work for Huxley Insurance,

12:56.479 --> 13:00.408
did you discover anything about Mr. Grey's
state of mind near the time of his death?

13:00.409 --> 13:03.130
Well, the first time I spoke
with Dr. Kim about the case,

13:03.131 --> 13:08.924
she informed that, uh, Thomas Grey
was not suicidal or depressed at all.

13:08.925 --> 13:10.232
The first time?

13:10.233 --> 13:12.637
Yeah, I was able to question
her again after an interview

13:12.638 --> 13:16.256
with one of the hospice
nurses raised a red flag.

13:16.257 --> 13:20.227
That's when she turned in her notes.

13:20.228 --> 13:21.424
Why then?

13:21.425 --> 13:24.780
I informed her that this case could
easily turn into a criminal investigation.

13:24.781 --> 13:26.322
And was that true?

13:26.323 --> 13:29.737
No, uh, not entirely, but,
uh, I felt I had no choice.

13:29.738 --> 13:32.240
My employer was demanding
to see those notes.

13:32.241 --> 13:33.808
What did you find in the notes?

13:33.809 --> 13:37.544
The exact opposite of what
she had originally told me.

13:37.545 --> 13:43.445
Uh, the notes claimed that Thomas
Grey was suicidal and depressed.

13:44.107 --> 13:45.718
Thank you, Mr. Newsome.

13:45.719 --> 13:47.939
Ms. Wade.

13:48.808 --> 13:50.668
- Mr. Newsome.
- Mm.

13:50.669 --> 13:53.995
Is it possible that you're
only here out of spite?

13:53.996 --> 13:54.824
Excuse me?

13:54.825 --> 13:57.983
Are you here because Dr. Kim
rejected your romantic advances,

13:57.984 --> 13:59.645
and you decided to get back at her?

13:59.646 --> 14:03.088
- Ms. Wade, what the hell is this?
- Uh, that's not true at all.

14:03.089 --> 14:05.357
I showed up at Dr. Kim's
house one evening to help

14:05.358 --> 14:07.259
her install a Security
Camera. That's about it.

14:07.260 --> 14:09.745
- But you wanted to get physical?
- Please stop.

14:09.746 --> 14:11.347
[Dominic] I don't
think this is relevant.

14:11.348 --> 14:16.320
If Mr. Newsome has a personal grudge
towards my client, I think it is.

14:16.321 --> 14:19.423
We'll agree to disagree.

14:19.424 --> 14:22.604
Thank you, Mr. Newsome.

14:26.432 --> 14:28.966
[Indistinct screaming]

14:28.967 --> 14:32.562
- [Madi] I can't wait to go on that.
- [Lucy] I think we should go here first.

14:32.563 --> 14:35.774
Oh, and then all the way back
this way until we get here.

14:35.775 --> 14:38.042
We should go on this one twice.

14:38.043 --> 14:40.077
And that one last.

14:40.078 --> 14:41.970
[April] Okay, okay.

14:41.971 --> 14:46.764
Hold on, girls. I know you're excited,
but we have to go over some rules first.

14:46.765 --> 14:47.926
No running off ahead of us.

14:47.927 --> 14:49.636
We have to be able to
see you at all times.

14:49.637 --> 14:50.933
Always stay together.

14:50.934 --> 14:55.708
- Ice cream and candy after we eat...
- After lunch.

14:55.709 --> 14:57.902
Let's go.

14:57.903 --> 15:00.363
Oh! Wait up.

15:00.874 --> 15:02.674
Oh.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.339
Thank you so much for taking us here.

15:05.340 --> 15:08.589
My mom took me to Disneyland
once, but I don't even remember it.

15:08.590 --> 15:11.950
Oh, you're welcome, Madi.

15:12.630 --> 15:17.250
- She really likes you.
- I like her, too.

15:20.981 --> 15:22.901
So...

15:22.916 --> 15:26.753
Do you have any sort of plan in
mind when it comes to my sister?

15:26.754 --> 15:28.854
[Laughs]

15:29.507 --> 15:32.569
I really hope that's not why
you wanted to talk because,

15:32.570 --> 15:33.978
it's not your business, now is it?

15:33.979 --> 15:36.145
Yeah, actually, it
is my business because

15:36.146 --> 15:38.248
right now, I'm the one
trying to save this marriage.

15:38.249 --> 15:41.518
So if... if you don't want
that, you need to let me know.

15:41.519 --> 15:43.547
[Cash register bell dings]

15:43.548 --> 15:46.057
There's nothing to
save, Joss. Not anymore.

15:46.058 --> 15:48.499
Why? Why not anymore?

15:48.500 --> 15:52.226
Because Savi must have
received the paternity results.

15:52.227 --> 15:57.259
And since I haven't heard a single
word from her and saw that...

15:57.260 --> 16:03.084
Bastard at our house, I can only
assume that the baby is not mine.

16:03.085 --> 16:06.675
Well, I can tell you that
that is 100% not true.

16:06.676 --> 16:09.198
So what, you're saying that she
hasn't received the results yet?

16:09.199 --> 16:14.265
No, no, she has, but she hasn't opened
them, she gave me the envelope instead.

16:14.266 --> 16:15.933
- So...
- Uh, no, I...

16:15.934 --> 16:18.545
I haven't opened them either, so...

16:18.546 --> 16:20.434
So what, she's not
planning to ever read them?

16:20.435 --> 16:23.383
I have no idea. You
know Savi. She's weird.

16:23.384 --> 16:26.820
She has her own way of doing everything.
But is this all really about the kid?

16:26.821 --> 16:27.649
Yes.

16:27.650 --> 16:30.857
Then call Genzide and make
them tell you the results.

16:30.858 --> 16:33.750
- Joss, if you have them...
- No, no, no, no, no.

16:33.751 --> 16:37.465
Honey, as much as I'm rooting for you,
kiddo, I can't betray the sisterhood.

16:37.466 --> 16:38.522
There are codes.

16:38.523 --> 16:41.639
- Now, Josslyn...
- Codes. Harry, stop.

16:41.640 --> 16:44.838
Listen, you have a sexy
accent and the baby blues.

16:44.839 --> 16:48.910
So walk into Genzide and make the
clerk tell you the information.

16:48.911 --> 16:51.847
And if the kid's not yours, you
can... you can get a divorce.

16:51.848 --> 16:53.130
Fine, if that's what you want.

16:53.131 --> 16:59.031
But, Harry, if that baby's yours, and you
don't step up, you could lose everything.

17:00.401 --> 17:03.401
[Indistinct screaming]

17:04.378 --> 17:07.499
They're still playing.

17:08.282 --> 17:11.652
So how come you don't
talk about her, your ex?

17:11.653 --> 17:13.387
Uh...

17:13.387 --> 17:15.289
I don't know.

17:15.290 --> 17:17.144
Why do you bring it up?

17:17.145 --> 17:19.358
Oh, it's... it's actually
been on my mind for a while.

17:19.359 --> 17:22.695
I was just waiting for the
right time to bring it up.

17:22.696 --> 17:26.606
Oh well, we broke up. I'm covered in Churro
dust, it's obviously the perfect time.

17:26.607 --> 17:28.269
You're right. You don't have to tell me.

17:28.270 --> 17:31.949
It's none of my business, and
the girls will be here any second.

17:31.950 --> 17:35.857
But for the record, you pretty
much know everything about my life,

17:35.858 --> 17:38.566
and I know nothing about yours.

17:38.567 --> 17:40.635
It seems kind of lopsided.

17:40.636 --> 17:44.532
I mean, I don't even
know this woman's name.

17:44.533 --> 17:46.440
It's Sandra.

17:46.441 --> 17:49.427
I don't like talking about it
because it's kind of embarrassing.

17:49.428 --> 17:51.994
More embarrassing then having
your husband fake his own death

17:51.995 --> 17:54.974
because he impregnated another woman?

17:54.975 --> 17:57.184
No. [Chuckles]

17:57.185 --> 17:59.719
She just left me for another guy
and moved to Chicago with him.

17:59.720 --> 18:02.900
She sees Madi when she
can, which is less and less.

18:02.901 --> 18:05.958
It's not as dramatic as your story,
but it still just kind of sucks.

18:05.959 --> 18:08.118
I'm sorry, Richard. Really.

18:08.119 --> 18:10.508
Don't be. It's okay.

18:10.509 --> 18:12.977
Madi and I have built
a good life together.

18:12.978 --> 18:14.111
We've adjusted.

18:14.112 --> 18:17.582
You've done a really good job with
her. I mean, you're a terrific dad.

18:17.583 --> 18:19.623
Thanks.

18:20.552 --> 18:23.717
Hey, Alex, it's me. I really
wish you'd pick up, because I

18:23.718 --> 18:27.390
have no idea what I'm looking at
here, and I don't know what you want.

18:27.391 --> 18:29.892
These... these aren't
real ice cream flavors.

18:29.893 --> 18:32.510
I think it's... does
that say "Olive Martini"?

18:32.511 --> 18:34.179
"Dehydrated bourbon"?

18:34.180 --> 18:35.837
"Lemongrass soufflé"?

18:35.838 --> 18:38.298
I... "Coconut breast
milk"? What is this?

18:38.299 --> 18:40.034
Uh, horseradish prince.

18:40.035 --> 18:41.989
Okay. That's just
Come on. You know what?

18:41.990 --> 18:43.793
Do you have some chocolate
chip or something?

18:43.794 --> 18:45.962
- Chocolate chip? No.
- Can you just check in the back?

18:45.963 --> 18:49.127
They don't have chocolate chip what ice
cream place doesn't have chocolate chip?

18:49.128 --> 18:51.359
Is this some kind of
practical joke or something?

18:51.360 --> 18:54.273
Because there's an ice cream store,
like, a block away from your house.

18:54.274 --> 18:56.784
Instead, I'm looking at...
Hi. I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

18:56.785 --> 19:00.496
I'm... I'm looking at something called,
what is that, "chocolate-covered bacon"?

19:00.497 --> 19:01.597
Do you like the bacon?

19:01.598 --> 19:02.847
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:02.848 --> 19:05.529
I really, I don't think that I
should be in charge of food shopping.

19:05.530 --> 19:08.214
I'm not good at it. I'm a
better restaurant picker outer.

19:08.215 --> 19:09.032
[Call waiting beeps]

19:09.033 --> 19:11.193
Oh, God.

19:11.212 --> 19:14.628
That's work. If you get this in the
next five minutes, please call me back.

19:14.629 --> 19:15.919
Hello.

19:15.920 --> 19:17.644
Hello, Josslyn. Ca va?

19:17.645 --> 19:19.994
I'm super-duper. What
can I do for you, Olivier?

19:19.995 --> 19:23.014
Are you familiar with the
property on Clark Drive?

19:23.015 --> 19:24.790
Um, Greg's listing?

19:24.791 --> 19:27.566
Yes. But Greg is unfortunately sick.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.195
I think he ate some bad crab.

19:29.196 --> 19:31.397
Would you be able to show
the listing to a couple that

19:31.398 --> 19:34.053
was planning on meeting
Greg there tonight at 7:00?

19:34.054 --> 19:35.635
Oh, um...

19:35.636 --> 19:38.260
Unless you are busy. I know
you are not working today.

19:38.261 --> 19:41.088
Uh, no. It... it's fine.

19:41.089 --> 19:45.437
- I... no problem. I'll be there.
- Parfait. [Speaks french] Merci.

19:45.438 --> 19:48.855
- I'll make it up to you.
- Okay, bye.

19:48.856 --> 19:51.440
You know what? Just cancel the...
the bacon. You don't even care.

19:51.441 --> 19:53.643
It's... [sighs] Thank you.

19:53.644 --> 19:56.812
Hey, Alex. It's me again. Bad news.

19:56.813 --> 19:59.806
My husband was a pillar
of this community.

19:59.807 --> 20:01.926
People looked up to him.

20:01.927 --> 20:05.045
He was too proud a man
to take his own life.

20:05.046 --> 20:07.498
So how do you explain
his asking for morphine?

20:07.499 --> 20:10.928
Tom was in a lot of pain.

20:10.929 --> 20:16.829
He wanted to live out the rest of
his life as joyfully as he could.

20:17.165 --> 20:19.834
Dr. Kim clearly lied
about his mental state.

20:19.835 --> 20:20.837
Objection.

20:20.838 --> 20:24.258
Noted. Continue, Mrs. Grey.

20:24.321 --> 20:26.300
Well...

20:26.301 --> 20:30.521
Once I discovered that Dr. Kim
had prescribed him the morphine.

20:30.522 --> 20:33.001
I started to question things.

20:33.002 --> 20:35.007
Based on what exactly?

20:35.008 --> 20:36.701
Call it a wife's intuition.

20:36.702 --> 20:42.602
I suspected, but had no proof,
how far their relationship went.

20:44.516 --> 20:47.433
Until Tom told me they
were having an affair.

20:47.434 --> 20:49.981
[Wade] Is your client planning
to say anything based on fact?

20:49.982 --> 20:54.607
She's answering the questions
to the best of her ability.

20:54.608 --> 20:57.177
So he told you about the affair?

20:57.178 --> 21:00.718
He was confessing a mistake.

21:00.793 --> 21:06.640

33:11.039 --> 33:14.159
Oh. You're not named.

33:14.272 --> 33:16.307
Not named as...

33:16.308 --> 33:17.244
As the father?

33:17.245 --> 33:20.043
No, no, not named on the consent form.

33:20.044 --> 33:22.920
As someone who can be told
any diagnostic information.

33:22.921 --> 33:25.981
Right. But you, um...

33:26.151 --> 33:29.448
You have the diagnostic information
right there in front of you, don't you?

33:29.449 --> 33:32.263
Well, yeah, I do.

33:32.264 --> 33:34.209
You could just tell me.

33:34.210 --> 33:36.430
I can't.

33:36.720 --> 33:40.780
That seems unfair, doesn't it,
you, a pretty stranger knowing,

33:40.781 --> 33:44.921
and me, the kid's potential father
out here completely in the dark?

33:44.922 --> 33:46.675
Mr. Davis, I can't.

33:46.676 --> 33:48.161
Really?

33:48.162 --> 33:51.699
Is there a problem here, Melanie?

33:51.700 --> 33:54.400
I really can't.

33:55.667 --> 33:57.765
[Baby fussing]

[Clicking keyboard keys]

34:02.440 --> 34:04.346
Can you state your name for the record?

34:04.347 --> 34:07.024
- Jacob Pollack.
- You know Dr. Kim well?

34:07.025 --> 34:08.759
We went to medical school together.

34:08.760 --> 34:14.016
Of course, she graduated in
the top 1%. Me, not so much.

34:14.016 --> 34:19.136
Uh, anyway, we reconnected
in 2007 at an awards ceremony.

34:19.137 --> 34:22.766
At which she shockingly was honored.

34:22.766 --> 34:25.962
Uh, for her minority patient
outreach work, I think.

34:25.963 --> 34:28.625
We understand. She's accomplished.

34:28.626 --> 34:31.737
- He's a character witness.
- [Scoffs]

34:31.739 --> 34:33.043
Go on, Dr. Pollack.

34:33.045 --> 34:35.813
We formed our practice together in 2008.

34:35.815 --> 34:39.556
I'd like to talk about the
night that Thomas Grey died.

34:39.556 --> 34:40.958
Okay, sure.

34:40.960 --> 34:45.580
Do you remember where
you were that night?

34:46.367 --> 34:47.853
Yes, I do.

34:47.855 --> 34:51.263
I was... I was at the office.

34:51.264 --> 34:53.904
Were you alone?

34:56.661 --> 35:00.562
- No.
- Lila was there with him.

35:02.610 --> 35:04.465
Our receptionist.

35:04.466 --> 35:06.082
Karen.

35:06.083 --> 35:10.551
I had given her a stack of cases
to file before I headed home.

35:10.552 --> 35:12.014
Karen, please.

35:12.015 --> 35:15.255
It's my turn to speak.

35:20.734 --> 35:24.154
Mr. Taylor, first question?

35:31.277 --> 35:34.239
Let's start with your notes from
the sessions with Thomas Grey.

35:34.240 --> 35:37.353
Why don't you ask me what
you really want to know?

35:37.354 --> 35:39.589
What do I really want to know?

35:39.590 --> 35:42.024
Where was I the night Thomas died?

35:42.025 --> 35:43.833
All right.

35:43.834 --> 35:46.474
Where were you?

35:47.552 --> 35:49.371
Home.

35:49.372 --> 35:50.539
Alone.

35:50.540 --> 35:52.700
[Exhales]

35:56.152 --> 35:59.487
I remember because Tom and
I had spoken that morning.

35:59.488 --> 36:03.448
And... he didn't sound very good.

36:04.314 --> 36:06.999
I wanted to be with him.

36:07.000 --> 36:12.040
But then again, I always
wanted to be with him.

36:15.573 --> 36:18.750
We were in love, you see?

36:18.751 --> 36:23.071
At least, he was the love of my life.

36:23.251 --> 36:25.467
I need a moment with my client.

36:25.468 --> 36:28.108
No, you don't.

36:31.045 --> 36:33.634
I fell in love with a married man.

36:33.635 --> 36:36.870
That was the first crime I committed.

36:36.871 --> 36:42.284
And I prescribed him morphine
so that he could end his life...

36:42.285 --> 36:48.185
Because I loved him so deeply, I couldn't
stand the thought of him suffering.

36:51.128 --> 36:55.876
And when he asked if I would
help him end his own life...

36:55.877 --> 36:58.577
I said I would.

36:59.583 --> 37:02.943
But that call never came.

37:03.699 --> 37:06.030
I believe Elizabeth Grey ended his life.

37:06.031 --> 37:08.613
- [Scoffs] This is insane.
- Elizabeth.

37:08.614 --> 37:09.525
[Sighs]

37:09.526 --> 37:14.326
What the circumstances
were, I'll never know.

37:15.578 --> 37:17.503
But I know what I did.

37:17.504 --> 37:21.284
I know the mistakes I've made.

37:22.609 --> 37:25.477
And now my conscience is clear.

37:25.478 --> 37:27.638
[Exhales]

37:29.081 --> 37:32.801
I doubt you can say the same.

[Cereal clinks in bowl]

37:50.703 --> 37:54.280
You know what? I changed my
mind. I do want to talk about it.

37:54.281 --> 37:56.472
Alex, please don't overreact.

37:56.473 --> 37:59.021
When the person that I'm
in a relationship with

37:59.022 --> 38:01.811
comes home with a bite
mark, I feel, I think,

38:01.812 --> 38:04.439
that I have a right to know
whose teeth it came from.

38:04.440 --> 38:07.072
What does it matter? It
was a guy. And you said...

38:07.073 --> 38:10.727
I said we could discuss boundaries,
and then you went and slept

38:10.728 --> 38:13.970
with someone without telling me
about it, which feels really weird.

38:13.971 --> 38:16.258
Only because you're
making it really weird.

38:16.259 --> 38:20.362
Okay, if it's so not a big deal...
then just tell me who it is.

38:20.363 --> 38:23.032
- Fine. You want to know who it was?
- Yes.

38:23.033 --> 38:25.635
It was Olivier.

38:25.636 --> 38:28.422
Olivier? Your boss Olivier?

38:28.423 --> 38:29.615
Mm-hmm.

38:29.616 --> 38:31.460
The guy that you're obsessed with?

38:31.461 --> 38:34.761
I wouldn't say obsessed.

38:35.515 --> 38:38.815
Wow. You're unbelievable.

38:39.472 --> 38:41.523
Okay, you know what, Alex?

38:41.524 --> 38:44.304
You're the one who brought up
sex with men in the first place.

38:44.305 --> 38:47.508
- You opened the door.
- Hypothetically. Hypothetically.

38:47.509 --> 38:49.648
There is nothing
hypothetical about Olivier.

38:49.649 --> 38:51.883
If you had come to me and
asked me if you could have

38:51.884 --> 38:54.341
sex with Olivier, I would've
said no, door's closed.

38:54.342 --> 38:55.609
Okay, I'm sorry.

38:55.610 --> 38:58.938
I'm just not used to having to ask
permission to have sex with people.

38:58.939 --> 39:00.927
Besides, I thought you
said that it didn't matter.

39:00.928 --> 39:03.414
God. It does matter. It does...

39:03.415 --> 39:05.670
Wait a second. Wait a
second. Was this last night?

39:05.671 --> 39:11.494
Did you cancel plans with my friend so
that you could go have sex with your boss?

39:11.495 --> 39:14.282
- Oh, my God.
- [Groans]

39:14.283 --> 39:16.158
Oh, my God.

39:16.159 --> 39:18.278
Alex, it wasn't a plan.

39:18.279 --> 39:20.187
I really had to show
a house, and then...

39:20.188 --> 39:23.908
What kind of person does that?

[Door closes]

39:29.099 --> 39:32.768
Oh. This is the problem with
women. They're too hung up on sex.

39:32.769 --> 39:35.213
[Laughs] Yes. Some of them are.

39:35.214 --> 39:38.138
Uh, before we go any further,
can we just talk about Karen?

39:38.139 --> 39:42.187
Have you spoken to her, and did she mention
anything about how the depos are going?

39:42.188 --> 39:43.623
No clue.

39:43.624 --> 39:44.836
Okay. Back to you.

39:44.837 --> 39:48.855
I mean, is Alex really gonna kick me out of
her life just because I slept with one guy?

39:48.856 --> 39:51.725
Which, by the way, she said
wasn't gonna be a huge deal.

39:51.726 --> 39:54.712
Well, I'm sure now that it happened,
she feels differently, right?

39:54.713 --> 39:56.716
I mean, it's one thing for
it to be a hypothetical.

39:56.717 --> 39:59.776
Oh, if I hear "hypothetical" one
more time, I'm gonna kill someone.

39:59.777 --> 40:02.812
Okay, you know what? Maybe we should
go downstairs and have some ice cream.

40:02.813 --> 40:04.638
That's what people do
when they get in fights.

40:04.639 --> 40:07.016
Oh, no. And don't say
"ice cream" either.

40:07.017 --> 40:08.351
Okay. I'll just let you talk.

40:08.352 --> 40:10.522
Well, what's the big
deal? Alex and I were...

40:10.523 --> 40:13.348
We were great, and Olivier was just sex.

40:13.349 --> 40:14.605
It meant nothing.

40:14.606 --> 40:17.288
I mean, no offense, but
you had sex with Dominic,

40:17.289 --> 40:19.614
and obviously, you still love Harry.

40:19.615 --> 40:22.353
Oh, what... relationships
are complicated.

40:22.354 --> 40:24.871
You just said "relationship".

40:24.872 --> 40:26.771
Oh, Lord. Here it comes.

40:26.772 --> 40:28.860
No. I'm proud of you.

40:28.861 --> 40:31.624
I know how hard it is for
you to even say that word

40:31.625 --> 40:33.643
when you're talking about yourself.

40:33.644 --> 40:34.714
You're maturing.

40:34.715 --> 40:37.732
Ewe. Can we change the subject? [Sighs]

40:37.733 --> 40:39.280
How was New York?

40:39.281 --> 40:40.765
- It was amazing.
- Mm.

40:40.766 --> 40:43.802
Dom put me up in the Four Seasons hotel.

40:43.803 --> 40:45.842
He booked me a prenatal massage.

40:45.843 --> 40:49.798
Man, the guy is really, uh,
pulling out all the stops, huh?

40:49.799 --> 40:51.395
Yeah.

40:51.396 --> 40:54.516
He is, and you know what?

40:54.517 --> 40:56.527
It feels really nice.

40:56.528 --> 40:59.851
So what are you saying, that
you have feelings for him now?

40:59.852 --> 41:02.891
Joss, I always had feelings for him.

41:02.892 --> 41:06.700
You know, that's how
this whole thing started.

41:06.701 --> 41:11.424
I've just been fighting
them for so long, and...

41:11.425 --> 41:16.345
I don't see any reason
to fight them anymore.

41:16.611 --> 41:18.711
Do you?

41:19.076 --> 41:22.676
Honestly, I don't know, Bug.

41:23.495 --> 41:28.230
I mean, do I not give
something with Dom a chance...

41:28.231 --> 41:32.311
Just because of the way it started?

- Bye.

today. I'm April, Lucy Malloy's mom.

42:11.512 --> 42:14.580
Oh, of course. Lucy was in
my music class this afternoon.

42:14.581 --> 42:15.553
So you've seen her.

42:15.554 --> 42:18.518
Yeah, she came out with the rest
of the kids, I'm pretty sure of it.

42:18.519 --> 42:20.119
Maybe she went home with a friend?

42:20.120 --> 42:24.918
No. She knew I was coming. We were gonna
have ice cream together. We had a plan.

42:24.919 --> 42:27.227
- Lucy!
- Okay, let me go get the Principal.

42:27.228 --> 42:30.530

would've been in a rental car.

Try to stay calm, Mrs. Malloy. I'll
be right back, we're gonna find her.
