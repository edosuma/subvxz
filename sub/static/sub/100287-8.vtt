That's terrible and I hope
it doesn't happen.

05:25.280 --> 05:26.460
What I can do is treat the baby

05:26.560 --> 05:28.340
because he's a genuine
out-of-area emergency.

05:28.440 --> 05:30.780
But I can't ask staff to fudge paperwork

05:30.880 --> 05:33.360

we'll need his bed for someone who's not.

[Salinda] Raph, I'm coming.

05:35.840 --> 05:37.840

to ask.

-No.

We run it here. On our machines.

No one else knows.

07:07.280 --> 07:09.280
Thank you.

07:10.880 --> 07:12.220
[Shay] You going to tell Eadie about that?

07:12.320 --> 07:13.500
[Lloyd] Yeah, I have to.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.600
What about this?

07:19.560 --> 07:20.580
Not yet.

07:20.680 --> 07:22.020
[Lloyd] She's got a lot on her plate.

07:22.120 --> 07:23.220
[Shay] She's always got a lot

07:23.320 --> 07:24.660
on her plate. What's your next excuse?

07:24.760 --> 07:28.080
I don't even have a positive result yet
and if we get one, then I'll choose...

07:28.920 --> 07:30.620
...who I tell and when I tell them.

07:30.720 --> 07:33.340
The days of you having voting rights
over me and Eadie,

I've got to... I've got to go to work
for a couple of hours.

08:21.720 --> 08:22.980
Can you look after the kids?

08:23.080 --> 08:24.180
They're still asleep.

08:24.280 --> 08:26.020
Mmhmm.

08:26.120 --> 08:27.460
Thank you.

08:27.560 --> 08:29.560
[Ivy] All good.

08:45.640 --> 08:46.700
[Archie] What's it all about?

08:46.800 --> 08:47.980
Starting with H?

08:48.080 --> 08:49.660
-Hydration, hydration, hydration!
-No, my turn!

08:49.760 --> 08:50.820
Hydration.

08:50.920 --> 08:52.060
Kids, keep it down a bit, will you?

08:52.160 --> 08:54.100
'Cesca, why didn't you wake me up?

08:54.200 --> 08:55.300
Because it must've been past midnight

08:55.400 --> 08:57.580
by the time you finally crawled into bed.

08:57.680 --> 08:59.100
Figured your body
was telling you something.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.940
-[Archie] Key energy strategy, Cosmo?
-Where were you?

09:01.040 --> 09:02.860
-I...
-[Archie] Cosmo?

09:02.960 --> 09:04.180
[Archie] Cosmo!

09:04.280 --> 09:05.900
I just... I ended up walking, that's all.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.140
[Francesca] Walking? In that heat?

09:07.240 --> 09:08.220
Key energy strategy, mate!

09:08.320 --> 09:09.380
-Listen...
-[Archie] Cosmo!

09:09.480 --> 09:11.020
[Archie] Answer the question
and you can get a lolly.

09:11.120 --> 09:12.700
I think we should go to the farm
for a bit.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.500
[Archie] Girls! Focus! What are you doing?

09:14.600 --> 09:18.020
Pack enough so that if we get there,
we might want to stay for a while.

09:18.120 --> 09:19.100
-[Tillie] What the heck?

09:19.200 --> 09:20.740
[Francesca] Stay for a while?
What does that mean?

09:20.840 --> 09:21.860
[Tillie] No! Mum!

09:21.960 --> 09:23.780
-[Archie] Don't! Don't, don't dob!
-[Tillie] He's breaking it!

09:23.880 --> 09:25.500
[Archie] Answer the question properly,
yeah?

09:25.600 --> 09:26.620
Things here...

09:26.720 --> 09:28.820
[Archie] Alright! Let's start again!

09:28.920 --> 09:31.120
Just... It just feels like it's time
to go.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.460
What's going on, Dom?
Has something happened?

09:33.560 --> 09:35.560
No. Nothing, nothing.

09:36.400 --> 09:37.620
-I just...
-[Archie] What's it all about?

09:37.720 --> 09:38.700
[Archie] Starting with H.

09:38.800 --> 09:40.100
I just want to keep you safe,
that's all.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.180
Safe?

09:41.280 --> 09:42.260
Yeah.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.360
I know things have been...

09:45.200 --> 09:46.300
Things have been a bit tough lately.

09:46.400 --> 09:48.500
Has something happened?
Dom, just tell me.

09:48.600 --> 09:49.580
It's all good, it's all good.

09:49.680 --> 09:50.820
That's not an answer.

09:50.920 --> 09:52.340
Look, we'll talk about it
when we get there.

09:52.440 --> 09:54.420
You pack and I'll swing by
and pick you up at the end of the day.

09:54.520 --> 09:56.740
[Archie] Key energy strategy. Cosmo?

09:56.840 --> 09:57.820
No.

09:57.920 --> 09:59.140
-We can't go today.
-[Archie] I don't care!

09:59.240 --> 10:01.140
-[Dom] Course we can.
-No, we can't. I've got plans.

10:01.240 --> 10:02.420
-I'm doing stuff with the kids.
-So cancel.

10:02.520 --> 10:03.980
No! You don't just get to do this, Dom.

10:04.080 --> 10:05.940
-[Tillie] I don't know!
-You don't just make decisions without me.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.740
-[Archie] Give me it! Stop!
-I am your partner, not your PA.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.660
Jesus Christ!

10:09.760 --> 10:11.760
Keep fighting over it, it goes in the bin!

10:13.160 --> 10:15.160
[Archie] Told you.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.800
I've got to go. We'll talk later.

10:31.640 --> 10:33.300
[Ivy]<i> OK, first animal.</i>

10:33.400 --> 10:35.400
-[Talia] A mouse.
-[Ivy] A mouse. OK.

10:36.880 --> 10:38.340
[Ivy] And I'm going to need
another animal.

10:38.440 --> 10:39.660
So, Leroy? You got an animal?

10:39.760 --> 10:40.740
[Leroy] Ah...

10:40.840 --> 10:42.100
Dragonfly.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.860
[Ivy] A dragonfly. OK.

10:43.960 --> 10:45.860
So...

10:45.960 --> 10:47.140
It's a mouse fly.

Open the door.

10:50.760 --> 10:52.960
[Ivy] Come on. Quick as you can.

10:53.760 --> 10:55.980
We're going to play a game
of hide and seek. So, hide in the corner.

10:56.080 --> 10:59.020
[woman] Hello? Can you open the door?

10:59.120 --> 11:01.540
We just need to talk to you.
[knocking]

11:01.640 --> 11:03.260
[man] We know that you're in there.

11:03.360 --> 11:05.400
Can you open the door, please?

[Talia] No!
[Ivy] Leave him!

Talia!

11:28.520 --> 11:30.740
-[Talia] Leave him alone! Leroy!
-[Ivy] Let him go!

11:30.840 --> 11:33.020
-[Ivy] You're lying!

11:33.120 --> 11:35.120
[man] Don't be stupid!

11:51.680 --> 11:53.380
Think he's my star patient today.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.740
Yes, you are, baby.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.460
-[Eadie] Ivy?
-They took them.

11:57.560 --> 11:59.180
What?

11:59.280 --> 12:01.280
They came and they took Leroy and Talia.

12:02.560 --> 12:04.220
-[Rima] How can they just take them
like that?

12:04.320 --> 12:05.300
-[Eadie] Hey...

12:05.400 --> 12:07.400
[indistinct police radio comms]

12:11.920 --> 12:13.940
Mrs. Latu, we're from the Department
of Domestic Affairs.

12:14.040 --> 12:15.940
I'm afraid we need to inform you

12:16.040 --> 12:17.220
that you and your children have overstayed

12:17.320 --> 12:18.780
the terms of your visa.

12:18.880 --> 12:20.100
Where are my children?

12:20.200 --> 12:21.180
They are with

12:22.560 --> 12:24.100
<i>Where?!</i>

12:24.200 --> 12:26.220
Mrs. Latu, you're here
without a valid visa.

12:26.320 --> 12:27.780
You've been identified
as illegal noncitizens.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.460
[baby crying]
As soon as your baby is well,

12:29.560 --> 12:30.740
you and the three children

12:30.840 --> 12:32.100
will be repatriated to Tonga.
[baby crying]

12:32.200 --> 12:34.460
I'm sorry, but this is a hospital.
You can't just barge in here.

12:34.560 --> 12:35.860
Documentation's all there.

12:35.960 --> 12:37.900
If you're done, I'd like you to leave.
This baby is sick

12:38.000 --> 12:39.460
and the last thing this family needs

12:39.560 --> 12:41.140
are you people threatening them.

12:41.240 --> 12:42.940
We can wait. But we're required
to take them into custody

12:43.040 --> 12:44.740
as soon as the discharge papers
have been signed.

12:44.840 --> 12:45.820
[baby crying]

12:45.920 --> 12:47.920
We won't be leaving here without them.

12:49.480 --> 12:51.480
I'll get the admission details.
Doctor.

12:54.800 --> 12:57.060
[Eadie]<i> Of all the Border officers</i>
<i>in all the world...</i>

12:57.160 --> 12:59.420
[Ben]<i> Yeah, I was surprised to hear</i>
<i>your name at the briefing.</i>

12:59.520 --> 13:01.300
What are you guys doing here, Ben?
This is nuts.

13:01.400 --> 13:03.180
You can't seriously go through with it?

13:03.280 --> 13:06.140
I have gone back through
all the paperwork.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.180
All their applications
have been turned down.

13:08.280 --> 13:09.340
They don't qualify to stay.

13:09.440 --> 13:10.860
Don't qualify?

13:10.960 --> 13:12.580
Do you actually know what you're
sending them back to?

13:12.680 --> 13:13.900
But I'm just telling you

13:14.000 --> 13:15.460
right, wrong or indifferent,

13:15.560 --> 13:18.220
the government don't recognise
their situation

13:18.320 --> 13:21.140
as one which qualifies as worthy
of our protection.

13:21.240 --> 13:25.400
[indistinct hospital PA]

13:26.760 --> 13:31.100
Look, I can try and make things
as civilised as possible but...

13:31.200 --> 13:33.640
If you tell me you're just doing
your job...

13:42.240 --> 13:44.240
[under breath] Jesus.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.500
[beep]

13:48.600 --> 13:50.600
Excuse me.

13:53.640 --> 13:55.640
Israel?

13:58.520 --> 14:00.520
Israel, what's happened?

14:03.280 --> 14:05.280
You can't just leave!

14:08.040 --> 14:10.040
Excuse me.

14:13.360 --> 14:14.340
[Archie] Cosmo!

14:14.440 --> 14:16.440
Why did you take stuff
from the bug out bag?

14:18.760 --> 14:19.740
Cosmo!

14:19.840 --> 14:20.940
Carlos isn't eating.
[lift bell rings]

14:21.040 --> 14:22.180
I don't give a shit about Carlos.

14:22.280 --> 14:23.420
[lift doors open]

14:23.520 --> 14:25.520
You're going to pick up every piece
of equipment and when Dad...

14:47.520 --> 14:49.520
[quietly] What are...

14:58.200 --> 15:00.200
Go away!

15:16.920 --> 15:18.920
[lift bell rings]

15:48.360 --> 15:50.360
[lift bell rings]

15:51.920 --> 15:54.020
[Francesca] That would be amazing.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.820
Thank you so much.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.920
Yeah, yeah. Great.
OK. We'll see you tomorrow.

16:00.080 --> 16:02.140
Everything alright, boys?

16:02.240 --> 16:04.380
[Archie] Everything's great.

16:04.480 --> 16:05.940
OK. Well, can you please pick
this stuff up?

16:06.040 --> 16:08.040
It shouldn't be out of those backpacks.

16:12.280 --> 16:13.540
His temperature's come down.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.220
He's doing really well but that leaves us
with a different problem

16:16.320 --> 16:18.300
because now, I don't know how to stop him
being discharged.

16:18.400 --> 16:19.940
No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

16:20.040 --> 16:22.060
We're of the understanding
that there's no further medical concern.

16:22.160 --> 16:23.260
[Eadie] Sorry, no.

16:23.360 --> 16:24.940
You haven't discharged him, have you?
-No.

16:25.040 --> 16:26.020
-[officer] Mrs. Latu, time to go.

16:26.120 --> 16:28.020
-Are you the children's father?
-Hang on, this is not happening.

16:28.120 --> 16:29.980
No one's going anywhere until we know
our kids are alright.

16:30.080 --> 16:31.260
Just calm down, please, sir.

16:31.360 --> 16:33.140
[Eadie] You can't just pack them off
to somewhere that's not safe.

16:33.240 --> 16:34.980
I understand you're upset
but there are laws in place.

16:35.080 --> 16:37.260
[Ivy] The laws don't make any sense!
[Eadie] Their home is underwater.

16:37.360 --> 16:38.860
-[Eadie] They have no shelter.
-Hey, hey, hey!

16:38.960 --> 16:40.500
Hey, listen, we'll take you to the kids,
alright?

16:40.600 --> 16:42.020
We can all just sit down
and work through the options.

16:42.120 --> 16:43.460
-Let her go!
-Back off, mate!

16:43.560 --> 16:45.580
-You want to spend the night in a cell?
-You think I give a shit?!

16:45.680 --> 16:48.720
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Everyone just needs to calm down!

16:50.120 --> 16:52.900
Mr. Latu, sir.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.060
Your wife and your kids

16:54.160 --> 16:55.780
need you here with them, OK?

16:55.880 --> 16:57.780
So, you need to take a breath...

16:57.880 --> 17:00.060
...for them.

17:00.160 --> 17:02.800
Alright? Everyone just needs
to settle down.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.660
This is... This is...

17:06.760 --> 17:08.380
This is not what doctors do.

17:08.480 --> 17:09.460
We...

17:09.560 --> 17:10.700
We don't release patients

17:10.800 --> 17:12.580
back into danger. We actually can't.

17:12.680 --> 17:14.220
As medical professionals,

17:14.320 --> 17:16.260
you're his admitting doctor

17:16.360 --> 17:17.980
and as is the case
with every single child

17:18.080 --> 17:19.740
under your care, you cannot discharge Sifa

17:19.840 --> 17:23.180
until a safe environment
has been identified,

17:23.280 --> 17:25.840
and sending him back is not safe.

17:29.720 --> 17:31.720
Dr. Boulay is right.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.440
[gentle music]

18:20.120 --> 18:22.120
-[Shay] Man...
-It's OK.

18:27.760 --> 18:29.760
It's OK.

18:30.080 --> 18:32.080
It's OK.

18:37.400 --> 18:38.940
[Shay]<i> We need to talk about funding.</i>

18:39.040 --> 18:40.260
[Herman]<i> There's nothing to talk about.</i>

18:40.360 --> 18:41.500
[Shay]<i> Yes, there is.</i>

18:41.600 --> 18:43.760
Dom, Karima, Carl.

18:44.760 --> 18:47.580
You put the triangle together
and the fact they cut you out

18:47.680 --> 18:49.900
somewhere along the line
does not absolve you of anything.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.220
That man in there was robbed of the right
to finish his work and do it right

18:53.320 --> 18:55.320
and you need to give that back to him.

18:55.920 --> 18:59.180
So, I argue for the funding
to be reinstated or...

18:59.280 --> 19:00.300
Or what?

19:00.400 --> 19:02.180
You go to the board and report me

19:02.280 --> 19:05.860
for trying to arrange a private partner
for a desperately needed project?

19:05.960 --> 19:07.300
Is that what this is?

19:07.400 --> 19:09.400
No, Herman.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.120
You do it because
it's the right thing to do.

19:39.600 --> 19:42.140
[woman] ...we do some colouring
while we're waiting for Mum and Dad?

19:42.240 --> 19:44.240
I brought you some books. Here you go.

19:44.720 --> 19:45.700
OK, got it?

19:45.800 --> 19:48.120
Here we go. Won't be long all right?

19:57.680 --> 19:59.680
[baby crying]

20:00.480 --> 20:02.480
-[Man whispering] Let's be gentle.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.720
Mr. and Mrs. Latu,
the children are waiting downstairs.

20:10.800 --> 20:11.900
If you get your things together,

20:12.000 --> 20:13.340
we can take you down to them right now.

20:13.440 --> 20:15.300
Hang on. What happens to Rima and Sifa

20:15.400 --> 20:18.020
if they go down there?
There's been no discharge yet?

20:18.120 --> 20:19.580
Not relevant. They're coming with us
voluntarily.

20:19.680 --> 20:21.380
Because you're bribing them
with their children

20:21.480 --> 20:23.300
and then you'll just take them
straight to the airport.

20:23.400 --> 20:24.660
They're very keen to see you,

20:24.760 --> 20:26.760
Mrs. Latu.

20:30.080 --> 20:31.100
Hey, what if I go down?

20:31.200 --> 20:33.380
They can't take me because they haven't
cancelled my visa yet.

20:33.480 --> 20:35.680
And I'll see if the kids are OK
and then we can decide.

20:37.440 --> 20:38.420
-OK.
-Yeah?

20:38.520 --> 20:40.520
-Yeah.
-OK.

20:42.760 --> 20:44.760
I'll go.

20:59.960 --> 21:01.960
-[Israel] Leroy! Leroy! Talia!
-Teti!

21:02.600 --> 21:03.860
Where's Mamma! Where's Sifa?

21:03.960 --> 21:06.020
They're upstairs. They're OK.

21:06.120 --> 21:07.140
They can't come out, Mr. Latu.

21:07.240 --> 21:08.740
We're just giving you the opportunity
to see they're OK.

21:08.840 --> 21:11.340
What are you talking about? They're
in this friggin' van. In this heat.

21:11.440 --> 21:13.020
Open the door.

21:13.120 --> 21:14.340
They're kids!
[woman] Sit down, Leroy.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.940
-[woman] Leroy.
-[Israel] Open the door!

21:16.040 --> 21:17.020
[Eadie] Israel.

21:17.120 --> 21:18.540
Tell them to open the door.

21:18.640 --> 21:20.380
-'Cause I will smash this window.
-The moment that your wife--

21:20.480 --> 21:22.940
[Ivy] I'm here at St Lucien's Hospital
with a family from Tonga.

21:23.040 --> 21:25.340
Do not film us. It is against the law
to film us during an operation.

21:25.440 --> 21:27.220
-Turn that off.
-[Ivy] I'm not. I'm not filming you.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.980
-Put that phone away.
-[Eadie] Get away from her!

21:29.080 --> 21:30.940
Open this car! Get my kids out!

21:31.040 --> 21:33.320
-Hey!
-Teti! Teti!

21:35.320 --> 21:37.020
-[woman] Sit down.
-No! Teti!

21:37.120 --> 21:39.120
-Talia.
-[Israel] Give me back my--

21:43.880 --> 21:45.920
-Get him off the ground!
-Get off him! Stop it!

21:48.280 --> 21:50.140
[Israel] I just want my kids back!

21:50.240 --> 21:51.340
[Israel] I'm coming, OK? I'm coming.

21:51.440 --> 21:52.740
Let my kids out!

21:52.840 --> 21:54.840
Easy, Mr. Latu.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.200
Just stay with the kids, OK?
Stay with the kids.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.400
[woman] Just sit down. Sit down.

22:03.680 --> 22:05.940
-[Ivy]<i> I'm here at St Lucien's Hospital...</i>
-[israel]<i> Oi! Open that door!</i>

22:06.040 --> 22:07.260
<i>...with a family from Tonga.</i>

22:07.360 --> 22:09.680
<i>-Do not film us.</i>
<i>-I'm not, I'm not filming you.</i>

22:10.640 --> 22:12.640
-[officer]<i> Put that phone away.</i>
-[Eadie] Don't threaten her!

22:13.560 --> 22:15.720
-[Ivy]<i> Open the door!</i>

22:18.080 --> 22:19.860
[Eadie]<i> If you call it in</i>
<i>and tell them he's got a gun,</i>

22:19.960 --> 22:21.860
they'll have them at the airport
in ten seconds flat.

22:21.960 --> 22:24.340
If I don't call it in and he decides
to get the gun out,

22:24.440 --> 22:27.020
there'll be 30 SWAT guys
here in ten seconds flat

22:27.120 --> 22:30.200
and they won't deport him,
they'll shoot him.

22:33.600 --> 22:35.600
Can you just get me something
to put it in?

22:36.760 --> 22:38.760
Yeah.

22:53.480 --> 22:55.480
Put it in that.

22:57.680 --> 22:59.680
You know what I'm talking about.

23:04.640 --> 23:09.880
Do you have any idea how much they're
itching for you to do something with that?

23:11.280 --> 23:13.280
[Eadie] It plays right into their hands,
Israel.

23:14.880 --> 23:16.880
If they push you again...

23:17.920 --> 23:19.920
...they push your wife, your kids...

23:21.880 --> 23:23.880
...it's in your hand in a heartbeat...

23:24.600 --> 23:25.820
...and there's no coming back.

23:25.920 --> 23:29.640
[tense music]

23:45.120 --> 23:47.120
I need my kids back.

23:57.480 --> 24:00.480
[indistinct radio comms]

24:07.720 --> 24:10.460
[crowd shouting]

24:10.560 --> 24:13.020
[shouting growing louder]

24:13.120 --> 24:15.560
Hey Barnes - We have a bit of a
situation down here in the car park...

24:17.480 --> 24:18.620
-Rough morning?
-Yeah.

24:18.720 --> 24:20.720
It's good to make noise sometimes, yeah?

24:22.760 --> 24:24.940
These are my friends
and they don't want you to go back.

24:25.040 --> 24:26.220
This is an abomination!

24:26.320 --> 24:27.420
We've got about 40 young protesters

24:27.520 --> 24:28.500
in the car park.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.180
[Ivy] They can be really noisy sometimes.

24:30.280 --> 24:32.720
But we're not going to let
anything bad happen to you!

24:34.640 --> 24:36.140
[Carl]<i> There's 479 heat deaths</i>

24:36.240 --> 24:37.660
already this morning. That's a record.

24:37.760 --> 24:39.980
There's 4,000 calls in the queue for 000

24:40.080 --> 24:42.260
and you can imagine
how much I need this.

24:42.360 --> 24:43.460
[Ivy]<i> Let go of him!</i>

24:43.560 --> 24:45.560
There's 100,000 views give or take.

24:46.280 --> 24:48.660
[Carl] The last thing I need
is a water cooler debate on migration

24:48.760 --> 24:49.740
just before I present

24:49.840 --> 24:50.980
the white paper.

24:51.080 --> 24:52.580
It'll go from zero to hysterical

24:52.680 --> 24:54.180
in a heartbeat.

24:54.280 --> 24:55.740
Then we get a whole tidal wave

24:55.840 --> 24:59.100
of negative publicity
saying we have a sterility agenda

24:59.200 --> 25:01.740
and then the whole thing implodes.

25:01.840 --> 25:04.500
Surely, there's a case here
for ministerial discretion.

25:04.600 --> 25:05.820
I mean, take the heat out of it.

25:05.920 --> 25:08.060
Just... Just... Just correct me
if I'm wrong

25:08.160 --> 25:10.740
but the reason why the Latus
are at the hospital

25:10.840 --> 25:13.240
and not in Tonga is because of you?

25:15.160 --> 25:17.540
I'm assuming you told your sister
about the immigration raid

25:17.640 --> 25:18.740
and she told them

25:18.840 --> 25:22.440
because the house was curiously empty
when the Border Authority arrived.

25:24.440 --> 25:25.780
She's playing you, Dom,

25:25.880 --> 25:27.660
and you're the one who's going
to have to pay the cost

25:27.760 --> 25:31.880
because there comes a point
where I can't protect you.

25:32.760 --> 25:33.740
I'll talk to her.

25:33.840 --> 25:35.380
No, it's gone... It's gone way
beyond that.

25:35.480 --> 25:37.100
The Latus are not getting a visa

25:37.200 --> 25:39.820
and if your sister doesn't pull the pin
on this shit show right now,

25:39.920 --> 25:41.920
she's going to jail.

25:51.560 --> 25:52.540
[Dom]<i> He's serious, Eadie.</i>

25:52.640 --> 25:55.020
I know you want to help them, but...

25:55.120 --> 25:57.340
I've got an idea. Why don't we just drown
them here instead?

25:57.440 --> 25:58.900
Save the cost of the charter flights.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.260
If it's... If it's me going to jail

26:01.360 --> 26:03.740
or giving up the Latus, I choose jail.

26:03.840 --> 26:04.820
Jesus, Eadie.

26:04.920 --> 26:06.940
You're going to have to let this one go,
OK?

26:07.040 --> 26:08.860
-[Eadie]<i> I'm sorry--</i>
-You're not sorry. You're never sorry.

26:08.960 --> 26:10.220
You just... You stick to your position

26:10.320 --> 26:11.900
and everyone else has to pick up
the pieces.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.020
Why don't you come down here
and see what's actually happening, Dom?

26:14.120 --> 26:15.140
In fact, why don't you bring Carl?

26:15.240 --> 26:17.240
He might find it really interesting.

26:23.120 --> 26:24.500
What is it?

26:24.600 --> 26:26.600
What's happened?

26:36.600 --> 26:38.220
[Carl]<i> Between 54 and 100 million</i>

26:38.320 --> 26:40.780
<i>environmental displacements this year.</i>

26:40.880 --> 26:42.500
<i>There's 30 million of us, all this space.</i>

26:42.600 --> 26:45.740
<i>I don't think anyone understands</i>

26:45.840 --> 26:47.060
<i>the implications of that.</i>

26:47.160 --> 26:48.420
[Dom]<i> But how are you going to sell it?</i>

26:48.520 --> 26:50.220
<i>"Welcome to sunny Australia,</i>

26:50.320 --> 26:52.980
<i>have a nice day. Here's a little bit</i>
<i>of sterility with your visa."</i>

26:53.080 --> 26:54.180
[Carl]<i> It's not 100%.</i>

26:54.280 --> 26:55.900
[Karima]<i> But it's near enough.</i>

26:56.000 --> 27:01.420
[Carl]<i> OK, if we don't put some kind</i>
<i>of immigration criteria in place,</i>

27:01.520 --> 27:05.040
<i>all of us, our kids, all of us,</i>
are cooked.

27:05.960 --> 27:09.340
<i>We're offering refuge, employment,</i>
<i>health care,</i>

27:09.440 --> 27:12.300
<i>protection against Chagas,</i>
<i>a dozen other diseases.</i>

27:12.400 --> 27:13.460
<i>It's just, you know, we can't...</i>

27:13.560 --> 27:16.220
[Dom]<i> What? So, you can come into</i>
<i>the country but you can't have a family?</i>

27:16.320 --> 27:17.860
<i>That's what we're saying.</i>

27:17.960 --> 27:19.300
[Carl]<i> Yeah, I can live with that.</i>

27:19.400 --> 27:20.580
[Karima]<i> Oh, Jesus, Carl.</i>

27:20.680 --> 27:22.140
[Carl]<i> Well, what are we going to do,</i>
<i>Karima?</i>

27:22.240 --> 27:23.420
<i>We're just going to squeeze over</i>

27:23.520 --> 27:24.980
<i>and let the whole world in?</i>

27:25.080 --> 27:27.980
<i>Because you cannot bang on</i>
<i>about environmental degradation</i>

27:28.080 --> 27:29.940
<i>and then just open the gates.</i>

27:30.040 --> 27:34.420
<i>Yeah, I know it's unpalatable</i>
<i>and people hate it but it's...</i>

27:34.520 --> 27:36.260
<i>You can't have both. You just can't.</i>

27:36.360 --> 27:39.380
[phone ringing]

27:39.480 --> 27:41.020
[Carl]<i> OK, I've got to take this.</i>

27:41.120 --> 27:43.120
I, um...

27:43.440 --> 27:45.440
[Carl]<i> Let's... Let's do this next week.</i>

27:47.480 --> 27:49.480
<i>See you, mate. Dom.</i>

27:50.960 --> 27:52.960
Please can you call him?

27:53.400 --> 27:54.820
Can you ask him to come here?

27:54.920 --> 27:56.920
Course I can.

28:02.160 --> 28:03.620
[drumming continues]

28:03.720 --> 28:05.700
[siren]

28:05.800 --> 28:07.800
[shouting]

28:10.240 --> 28:11.860
[Zoe] Keep going! Keep going!

28:11.960 --> 28:13.960
Keep going! Keep going!

28:16.240 --> 28:17.980
Alright, who's got handcuffs?

28:18.080 --> 28:19.060
[siren]

28:19.160 --> 28:21.160
[drumming continues]

28:21.720 --> 28:23.720
[Zoe] Go! Go, go, go!

28:27.440 --> 28:29.620
[Zoe] You ready? Arms through.

28:29.720 --> 28:31.720
Good.

28:35.040 --> 28:37.040
You game?

28:37.880 --> 28:39.880
[whistle blow]

28:51.440 --> 28:53.540
[Dom]<i> No. No, that's not what I thought</i>
<i>would happen.</i>

28:53.640 --> 28:56.220
<i>I honestly thought you would...</i>
<i>you'd see the</i> opportunity

28:56.320 --> 28:58.140
<i>and let them fund it properly</i>
<i>and then you'd be able</i>

28:58.240 --> 29:01.020
to iron out the problems, the vax
would get to the people who needed it

29:01.120 --> 29:02.380
instead of dying a slow death in the lab.

29:02.480 --> 29:04.740
And when I didn't cave,
you sick your dogs onto Shay.

29:04.840 --> 29:06.620
Again, I thought she was going
to try and use it as leverage

29:06.720 --> 29:08.760
to get you on board,
not cut you out altogether.

29:09.680 --> 29:10.860
I mean, I was as shocked as you were

29:10.960 --> 29:12.740
to find out that she was pushing
ahead without you.

29:12.840 --> 29:14.460
[Shay] Out of interest,
how much was in it for you?

29:14.560 --> 29:16.100
It's not about the money.

29:16.200 --> 29:18.180
It's about all those people
who can't have children

29:18.280 --> 29:19.460
because they were vaccinated

29:19.560 --> 29:21.760
and making sure that doesn't happen
to anyone else.

29:24.800 --> 29:26.800
Eadie?

29:29.880 --> 29:31.880
Ead.

29:33.160 --> 29:38.400
You sat there and you listened to him talk
about sterilisation and you said nothing.

29:40.160 --> 29:41.700
Well, you must know
I'd never have got involved

29:41.800 --> 29:43.380
if I thought that was even a possibility.

29:43.480 --> 29:45.660
[Eadie] I want to believe that, Dom.

29:45.760 --> 29:47.760
I need to 'cause the alternative is...

29:50.120 --> 29:52.120
But that lunch was two weeks ago.

29:53.040 --> 29:55.040
It's been two weeks.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.540
Why didn't you do anything?

29:57.640 --> 29:59.700
Because...

29:59.800 --> 30:01.800
I didn't...

30:06.640 --> 30:07.620
Alright, well...

30:07.720 --> 30:09.720
Alright, well, what do you think
I could've done?

30:13.920 --> 30:15.920
Eadie!

30:16.280 --> 30:19.100
The Latus don't get on that plane.

30:19.200 --> 30:20.660
The fax gets binned.

30:20.760 --> 30:22.760
That's what needs to happen.

30:23.480 --> 30:24.460
And how I supposed to do that?

30:24.560 --> 30:27.520
[Shay] I don't think anyone cares
how you do it, Dom. Just get it done.

30:33.720 --> 30:35.500
Eddie, Eadie.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.600
You're bleeding.

30:39.800 --> 30:41.900
Come with me.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Come.

31:04.200 --> 31:05.900
[two heartbeats]
Hello, double.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.060
Hello, trouble.

31:07.160 --> 31:10.160
[heartbeats]

31:16.680 --> 31:18.780
So, what does the...

31:18.880 --> 31:20.780
What is the bleeding mean?

31:20.880 --> 31:22.100
People can spot all the way through.

31:22.200 --> 31:24.200
It doesn't have to be a big deal.

31:24.760 --> 31:26.960
Should she be on bed rest or something?

31:29.120 --> 31:32.980
[Salinda] Probably both should be.
Two monkeys to chase.

31:33.080 --> 31:35.080
Hope you're ready, super dad.

31:45.600 --> 31:47.600
What? What is it?

31:48.800 --> 31:49.940
I'm just seeing

31:50.040 --> 31:51.820
the one placenta.

31:51.920 --> 31:54.060
[heartbeats]

31:54.160 --> 31:56.160
You've got monochorionic twins.

31:57.000 --> 31:57.980
So, identical

31:58.080 --> 31:59.780
with just a single placenta.

31:59.880 --> 32:02.080
Is that a problem?

32:03.480 --> 32:05.480
It can be. It's...

32:06.040 --> 32:08.340
It's like two seeds growing
from one planter box

32:08.440 --> 32:10.660
and depending on the way the veins

32:10.760 --> 32:13.160
develop in the umbilical cords,
there can be an imbalance.

32:14.360 --> 32:16.360
So, resources not equally shared.

32:17.160 --> 32:20.080
So, one thrives while the other struggles
to survive.

32:23.440 --> 32:25.980
You're going to have a scan
every two weeks

32:26.080 --> 32:27.620
and if there's a problem,

32:27.720 --> 32:29.720
we'll be on it straight away.

32:30.160 --> 32:32.160
OK?

32:44.160 --> 32:46.160
They're just going to have
to learn to share.

32:47.880 --> 32:49.880
[knock on door]

32:55.960 --> 32:57.960
I'm sorry to interrupt.
There's something you need to see.

33:00.160 --> 33:02.020
[crowd shouting]

33:02.120 --> 33:04.720
It's heating up. She's down there,
furthest barrel to the right.

33:06.640 --> 33:09.640
[crowd chanting loudly]

33:22.920 --> 33:24.740
Excuse me, excuse me.

33:24.840 --> 33:25.940
Excuse me.

33:26.040 --> 33:28.040
Excuse me.

33:30.600 --> 33:32.600
Am I in trouble?

33:35.200 --> 33:37.200
No.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.100
[Rima] Maybe we just...

33:54.200 --> 33:58.440
Maybe we just go back
and try to make an appeal from there.

34:01.160 --> 34:04.160
[baby chattering]

34:05.760 --> 34:07.760
Sir.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.880
OK.

34:13.600 --> 34:14.620
No, no. I can do that.

34:14.720 --> 34:15.980
I think they'd...

34:16.080 --> 34:18.260
I think they'd appreciate it.

34:18.360 --> 34:20.360
OK. Will do.

34:24.080 --> 34:26.080
An olive branch from the department.

34:26.840 --> 34:29.620
[loud shouting]

34:29.720 --> 34:31.720
I've got a meeting with Herman
in the morning.

34:32.720 --> 34:34.720
I heard a rumour we're getting
our funding back.

34:37.360 --> 34:39.920
He wants us to cook up
something with the biomedical team.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.220
Use everything we know about Chagas

34:42.320 --> 34:45.060
to try and find a cure
instead of a vaccine.

34:45.160 --> 34:46.420
Excuse me.

34:46.520 --> 34:48.220
That's Herman's plan?

34:48.320 --> 34:49.740
[Shay] I know, right?

34:49.840 --> 34:52.220
Every now and then he comes out
with a cracker.

34:52.320 --> 34:54.320
It sounds like a good plan A.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
But we're going to need a plan B, Shay.

34:59.160 --> 35:00.260
The whole godfather thing.

35:00.360 --> 35:02.360
That could get very real.

35:03.760 --> 35:06.060
Eadie, the babies, that's complicated,

35:06.160 --> 35:08.160
so she's going to need a lot of support.

35:12.640 --> 35:13.780
Hey.

35:13.880 --> 35:15.860
I'm all in.

35:15.960 --> 35:17.620
If it comes to that.

35:17.720 --> 35:19.880
I'm more all-in for plan A.

35:21.680 --> 35:23.860
Yeah. It's a... It's a better plan.

35:23.960 --> 35:25.960
Let's go.

35:27.560 --> 35:29.140
[angry chanting]
[crowd] Save us! Save him!

35:29.240 --> 35:30.580
[crowd] Refugees are welcome here!

35:30.680 --> 35:32.460
-Excuse me. Excuse me.
-[crowd] No hate! No fear!

35:32.560 --> 35:34.900
-Sorry, mate. Out of the way.
-[crowd] Refugees are welcome here!

35:35.000 --> 35:37.100
[crowd] Save us! Save him!

35:37.200 --> 35:38.260
[crowd] Refugees are welcome here!

35:38.360 --> 35:40.420
[crowd] No hate! No fear!
Eadie, you OK?

35:40.520 --> 35:42.500
Orders from the department
to take the children upstairs

35:42.600 --> 35:43.900
for a quick visit.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.820
[crowd] Refugees are welcome here!

35:45.920 --> 35:48.780
[crowd] No hate! No fear!
Refugees are welcome here!

35:48.880 --> 35:51.480
[applause and cheering]

35:54.840 --> 35:56.840
Where are they taking them?

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
[ominous music]

36:12.600 --> 36:14.600
[dog barks]

36:16.200 --> 36:18.200
[dog barks]

36:22.400 --> 36:24.400
[music building]

36:33.920 --> 36:35.920
[inaudible under music]

36:44.240 --> 36:47.360
My sister has a video
of our lunch meeting with Karima.

36:48.840 --> 36:52.300
You talking of the unexpected sterility
benefits of the Chagas vax.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.340
So, what, she wants to threaten me
into giving them a visa.

36:54.440 --> 36:56.100
She's not threatening you.

36:56.200 --> 36:58.180
I am.

36:58.280 --> 37:01.480
If the Latus don't get their visa
and the vax plan doesn't get shelved,

37:02.520 --> 37:04.520
then that video will be uploaded.

37:05.400 --> 37:07.420
I wonder what that mob
outside the hospital will make of you

37:07.520 --> 37:09.520
endorsing the mass sterilisation
of immigrants?

37:10.920 --> 37:15.000
See, I don't see how you follow through
with that and keep your name out of it.

37:16.480 --> 37:18.480
I'm not sure that I could.

37:18.880 --> 37:20.880
I'm not sure that it matters anymore.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
I'd think it through carefully, Dom.

37:25.120 --> 37:26.700
There's just a lot of pressure

37:26.800 --> 37:29.440
to make an example
of those people at the hospital.

37:31.160 --> 37:33.160
Calls for a show of force.

37:38.560 --> 37:41.600
[Carl] I'd be thinking about my family,
if I were you, mate.

37:49.360 --> 37:51.360
They're everywhere.

37:51.840 --> 37:53.840
Like stray cats.

37:55.240 --> 37:57.460
-[Tillie] Can I have it?
-[Sage] No, it's mine!

37:57.560 --> 37:59.380
-[Tillie] Please!
-[Sage] No!

37:59.480 --> 38:01.720
-[Tillie] Give it to me!
-[Sage] No!

38:03.200 --> 38:05.380
-[Tillie] It's my turn!
-[Sage] You had it all morning!

38:05.480 --> 38:07.480
[snap]

38:08.000 --> 38:10.620
-[Tillie] Great.
-[Sage] You broke it.

38:10.720 --> 38:12.720
[Tillie] No, you did.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.180
[Sage] Give it!

38:18.280 --> 38:19.420
-Kids!
-[Tillie] It's your fault.

38:19.520 --> 38:21.520
I need you all to pack a bag.

38:21.920 --> 38:23.140
We're going to Aunty Bea's.

38:23.240 --> 38:24.620
Dad said we should pack for the farm.

38:24.720 --> 38:26.860
Well, were not going to the farm.
We're going to Aunty Bea's.

38:26.960 --> 38:28.660
I need you to pack for a few weeks, yeah?

38:28.760 --> 38:30.180
-Maybe a month.
-Mum, does Dad know?

38:30.280 --> 38:31.700
No, he doesn't
and he won't be coming with us.

38:31.800 --> 38:33.420
Cos, you're the eldest.

38:33.520 --> 38:34.820
You're in charge.

38:34.920 --> 38:37.560
One more. Right to the end. Can you see?
