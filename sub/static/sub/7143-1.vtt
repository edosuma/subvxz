15:20.619 --> 15:22.098
you promised me you were
gonna stay out of this shit.

to say, man?

15:23.422 --> 15:24.457
Not a fucking word!

15:26.125 --> 15:29.698
I didn't have anybody to tell
me I was fucking up. You do!

15:30.663 --> 15:32.700

and the boys in this shit?

your money within a month.

16:38.364 --> 16:39.809

16:39.932 --> 16:41.878
So I'll give you two weeks.

16:41.934 --> 16:44.881
If not, I'm going to come
after the both of you.

16:45.037 --> 16:46.209

down the line.

You'll get your fucking money.

It's okay.
Yeah, we're just playing.

17:16.367 --> 17:18.678

else to do, okay?

18:37.583 --> 18:38.721
I hate to tell you,

18:38.784 --> 18:40.661
but that little
dumb fuck has put us

18:40.719 --> 18:42.562
in the worst

And if they don't get the money
from him, they're coming after us.
