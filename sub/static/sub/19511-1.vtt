WEBVTT

00:02.300 --> 00:05.000
Previously on "The Breaks"...

00:05.000 --> 00:06.467
You snuck in here?

00:06.467 --> 00:08.533
You remember me, don't you?
We met last summer.

00:08.533 --> 00:10.000
You said you'd hold
a position for me.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
I moved here for that job.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.133
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

00:12.133 --> 00:13.333
Oh!

00:13.333 --> 00:14.633
Get this crazy bitch
out of here!

00:14.633 --> 00:16.000
Unreasonable bitch.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.733
Which is exactly why you said
you were gonna hire me.

00:17.733 --> 00:20.000
You said the world is not
changed by reasonable men.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.633
This business rewards hustle,
and you a hustler.

00:22.633 --> 00:24.933
I'm a DJ and a producer.

00:24.933 --> 00:26.433
You know it's gonna
be dope, a'ight?

00:26.433 --> 00:27.500
Word.

00:27.500 --> 00:29.000
Oh, shit!

00:29.000 --> 00:31.033
Think I wanna hear that noise
when I get in from work?

00:31.033 --> 00:32.200
But this is real, Dad.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.533
It's average.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.200
And average ain't gonna
get you on, DeeVee.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.733
You need a real emcee.

00:42.367 --> 00:44.800
I wanna make
a record with you.

00:44.800 --> 00:48.133
That's what happen
when you hang with thugs.

00:48.133 --> 00:49.400
We gonna do this.

00:55.867 --> 00:57.267
Yo, that's ill!

00:57.267 --> 01:00.933
From now on, WPPS will play
no rap, period.

01:00.933 --> 01:03.467
It is the most important
musical movement--
Enough.

01:03.467 --> 01:05.333
Stick to getting
my coffee.

01:05.333 --> 01:09.233
I got fired.
Felt good too.

01:09.233 --> 01:10.400
What are you doing here, Juggy?

01:10.400 --> 01:12.233
You're a real asshole,
you know that?

01:12.233 --> 01:13.867
Not the first time
I heard that, son.

01:13.867 --> 01:16.567
When I was little, he was taking
the money from his artists.

01:16.567 --> 01:19.333
If you wanna be in a position
to make the music,

01:19.333 --> 01:21.233
you need to figure out how
to affect the bottom line.

01:21.233 --> 01:22.533
It's the only thing
people care about.

01:22.533 --> 01:23.833
Gordy manufactures receipts

01:23.833 --> 01:25.400
when he's on tour,
and he pockets the cash.

01:25.400 --> 01:27.167
And you gonna trust this ho
over your boy?

01:29.867 --> 01:31.333
This is not my girlfriend!

01:31.333 --> 01:34.667
This is, though,
my new personal assistant.

01:34.667 --> 01:37.133
...to the window--

01:37.133 --> 01:39.067
He was here all day?

01:39.067 --> 01:40.667
Yeah, no doubt.
He was here all day.

01:42.200 --> 01:45.133
I am Barry Fouray's
new personal assistant.

01:45.133 --> 01:46.533
Word?
And I'm about to go

01:46.533 --> 01:47.800
let him listen
to your tape.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.667
Let's go!

01:53.200 --> 01:55.167
Call your man up, tell him
I said come down here.

01:55.167 --> 01:56.233
That shit hot.

01:57.800 --> 01:59.700
Geronimo had something to do
with Smoke getting killed.

01:59.700 --> 02:01.400
I'm glad he's dead,

02:01.400 --> 02:03.067
but I ain't had
nothing to do with it.

02:03.067 --> 02:06.067
Why should we believe that?

02:06.067 --> 02:07.767
DeeVee.

02:35.933 --> 02:37.700
How long we gonna wait, man?

02:37.700 --> 02:39.700
As long as it takes.

02:39.700 --> 02:41.267
That's too long.

02:54.467 --> 02:58.567
Yeah.
Finish, wait for it.

03:06.067 --> 03:09.067
Shit.
Who's the prophet?

03:43.533 --> 03:45.933
Ay yo, Bruce.

03:47.133 --> 03:48.300
Motherfucker.

04:09.700 --> 04:11.500
So you cool with finishing
up packing without me?

04:11.500 --> 04:12.767
Yeah, it's fine.

04:12.767 --> 04:14.300
It's the first day.
You got the listening party.

04:14.300 --> 04:16.933
It's all good.

04:16.933 --> 04:18.167
What's wrong with you?

04:18.167 --> 04:19.967
Did you hear it?
Hear what?

04:19.967 --> 04:22.067
The track?
Ahm, man.

04:22.067 --> 04:23.633
Are you high?

04:23.633 --> 04:25.133
He wasn't high
a minute ago.

04:25.133 --> 04:26.700
Look, I shit you not,
all right?

04:26.700 --> 04:29.067
A car just rolled by
playing the record.

04:29.067 --> 04:30.567
The man's a dreamer.

04:30.567 --> 04:31.767
Always has been.

04:31.767 --> 04:33.200
Yo, Mattie Taylor
just got promoted.

04:33.200 --> 04:36.767
Really? Good for her.

04:41.400 --> 04:43.600
Come on, man, stop
sweatin' me, son.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.500
Sweating you?
You owe me money, man!

04:45.500 --> 04:47.067
Yeah, you always
talk about money.

04:47.067 --> 04:48.433
You ain't the bill
collector, relax!

04:48.433 --> 04:50.867
Say that to
my face, then!

04:50.867 --> 04:52.067
I hear you.

04:52.067 --> 04:53.400
Come down here
and say it to my face.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.167
That's five shows a week
for 32 weeks, Barry!

04:55.167 --> 04:56.333
I already told you, man,

04:56.333 --> 04:58.100
the record label
froze the money!

04:58.100 --> 05:00.533
$20,890, Barry!
You owe me money!

05:00.533 --> 05:01.800
All right, look, Lil Ray,
don't sweat me

05:01.800 --> 05:02.900
over that, I got you.

05:02.900 --> 05:04.267
Just, look, come up here!

05:04.267 --> 05:05.633
We can smoke a Cohiba!

05:05.633 --> 05:07.400
I got some more
honey dips coming through!

05:07.400 --> 05:09.100
I'm not one of your dumb-ass
rappers, Barry.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.367
You know, you fuckin'
with the wrong one!

05:10.367 --> 05:12.133
Hey, Lil Ray!

05:12.133 --> 05:14.567
Lil Ray!
Hello.

05:14.567 --> 05:17.300
Good morning, Nikki Jones!
What you doing?

05:17.300 --> 05:19.100
You walkin' up
the sidewalk?

05:19.100 --> 05:20.733
When you early,
you on time!

05:20.733 --> 05:22.500
When you on time,
you are late!

05:22.500 --> 05:24.300
When you late,
you fired!

05:26.900 --> 05:28.967
I told her to come
to the hair salon with me

05:28.967 --> 05:32.700
and get her highlights done,
too, but she don't listen.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.733
Yeah.

05:34.733 --> 05:36.933
No, yeah, she went
to her friend's salon.

05:36.933 --> 05:38.700
Now she look
like a rainbow.

05:38.700 --> 05:41.700
Where's
Barry's apartment?

05:41.700 --> 05:46.933
Girl, let me call you back.

05:46.933 --> 05:49.600
Fouray Management, Tamika.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.533
No, he got fired.

05:55.067 --> 05:58.100
It's open!

05:58.100 --> 05:59.400
Yeah.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.700
Hey! Write this down.

06:01.700 --> 06:04.500
$2,350.

06:04.500 --> 06:08.200
7:00-- yeah, tonight,
that's for tonight.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.067
1,700 for styling.

06:10.067 --> 06:12.900
1,325 that I did
for promotion.

06:12.900 --> 06:16.800
1,500 that I did
for the-- for the photo shoot.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.300
And it adds up, that's--

06:19.300 --> 06:20.633
6,000...
6,000...

06:20.633 --> 06:21.633
$875.

06:21.633 --> 06:24.600
$6,875, that's
out of my pocket.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.600
Yeah, and I submitted
the invoices.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.433
I been submitting
the invoices.

06:28.433 --> 06:30.200
Look, look-look-look.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.700
You-- no-no-no-no-no.

06:31.700 --> 06:34.600
You guaranteed $10,000
in-- in pre-release--

06:34.600 --> 06:37.433
in pre-release money
and I ain't seen shit.

06:42.567 --> 06:44.233
Look, dude,
the second album

06:44.233 --> 06:46.600
need to be bigger
than the first album.

06:46.600 --> 06:49.233
Otherwise, he gonna
look like a fluke.

06:49.233 --> 06:51.100
So you'll pay for it!

06:51.100 --> 06:52.533
You the label!

06:52.533 --> 06:55.933
You call Burt.
I'm not calling Burt.

06:55.933 --> 06:57.667
No, I'm not.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.100
And listen,
when you call him,

06:59.100 --> 07:01.333
tell him if Special Ed,
if his--

07:01.333 --> 07:03.600
if his listening party
is wack, it's his fault.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.400
Sweetheart, you know
I need that coffee.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.933
Black, too.

07:06.933 --> 07:09.067
You want some eggs?
You hungry?
Uh...

07:09.067 --> 07:11.133
Uh, nah, I don't really want
a naked woman making me eggs.

07:11.133 --> 07:15.267
Eggs is eggs.
Uh, okay.

07:15.267 --> 07:16.733
No.

07:16.733 --> 07:18.867
Come on, man,
come on, really?

07:18.867 --> 07:21.067
Oh, my God, no, thanks.

07:21.067 --> 07:22.600
Um...

07:22.600 --> 07:25.367
Listen, man, no,
I'm not down with the video.

07:25.367 --> 07:27.233
Not the director,
the song.

07:27.233 --> 07:30.533
Track number one,
that's the one.

07:30.533 --> 07:35.067
Ahh, you buggin'.
Call me back.

07:35.067 --> 07:37.400
Ah, all right,
Nikki Jones.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.533
Welcome to
the music industry.

07:39.533 --> 07:40.967
You better keep up.

07:43.833 --> 07:45.800
You need to be in the space
on time for the sound check.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.933
Makin' sure everything
goin' smooth.

07:47.933 --> 07:50.233
Call Russell, Tommy,
Fab Five, Rudy and Max

07:50.233 --> 07:52.400
and when you talk to them--
Uh--

07:52.400 --> 07:53.867
Are you paying attention?
Yes.

07:53.867 --> 07:55.400
You sure?
Uh-huh.

07:55.400 --> 07:58.067
Okay, because we can't
have any bullshit today.

07:58.067 --> 08:00.833
This is
a very important day.

08:00.833 --> 08:04.133
Mm-hmm.
Uh, the label called.

08:04.133 --> 08:06.167
They won't budge
on the 5K.

08:06.167 --> 08:09.300
Your 50-person VIP
list is now 25.

08:09.300 --> 08:12.533
Mother, whoo.
Always somethin'.

08:12.533 --> 08:14.067
Cut Funk and Klein.

08:14.067 --> 08:15.633
Cut Dante Ross.

08:15.633 --> 08:18.267
Wait, wait,
I wouldn't cut Dante.

08:18.267 --> 08:19.733
He's in A&R at Elektra.

08:19.733 --> 08:22.100
Don't you have, like,
two clients over there?

08:22.100 --> 08:23.433
I'm just sayin'.

08:23.433 --> 08:24.967
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah,
you're right,

08:24.967 --> 08:26.767
you're right, you're right,
no, don't cut Dante.

08:26.767 --> 08:29.333
Yeah, we don't need to make it
any harder on our artists.

08:29.333 --> 08:31.067
Speaking of which,

08:31.067 --> 08:34.667
how many people did you tell
I was repping that Ahm cat?

08:34.667 --> 08:36.067
Don't look surprised.

08:36.067 --> 08:38.233
I got the all-seeing
eyes over here, Nikki.

08:38.233 --> 08:41.733
No, look, the song he made
with DeeVee is hot.

08:41.733 --> 08:43.733
And he's not signed
with anyone.

08:43.733 --> 08:45.600
Well, you better bring him here
and have him signed by me

08:45.600 --> 08:48.567
by the end of the day
if you wanna keep your job.

08:48.567 --> 08:52.267
And cut this list
down to 35.

08:52.267 --> 08:54.933
Tamika, hold my calls.

08:54.933 --> 08:56.867
Yeah, all right.

09:01.067 --> 09:02.467
Unh-unh, what you doing?

09:02.467 --> 09:04.600
I have to send a page
for Barry.

09:07.700 --> 09:10.567
Okay, now can you
get out of my space?

09:10.567 --> 09:12.067
Where's my space?

09:12.067 --> 09:13.500
Shouldn't I have, like,
an office or something?

09:13.500 --> 09:15.233
I am Barry's assistant.

09:15.233 --> 09:18.567
Over there.

09:24.100 --> 09:26.067
What the fuck!

09:26.067 --> 09:27.367
Oh, I'm so sorry.

09:27.367 --> 09:28.767
What, you don't knock?

09:28.767 --> 09:30.767
I just-- I-- I was
told this was my--

09:30.767 --> 09:31.933
Your what?
Who are you?

09:31.933 --> 09:33.933
Nikki Jones,
Barry's new assistant.

09:33.933 --> 09:35.767
Great, well, tell Barry we have
to reshoot Dizzy Mystique's

09:35.767 --> 09:38.433
new promo photos,
thanks to you.

10:10.300 --> 10:12.967
Yo.

10:12.967 --> 10:14.900
Headmaster Prep.

10:18.400 --> 10:22.400
Yo, you won't believe what
happened the other night.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.267
I, yo...

10:24.267 --> 10:27.400
Chuck Chillout plays
our record first, okay?

10:27.400 --> 10:29.000
And people dig it.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.700
Like, really, really,
really dig it.

10:31.700 --> 10:33.267
Barry Fouray's, like,

10:33.267 --> 10:34.433
"Yo, get your mans
down here right now.

10:34.433 --> 10:36.267
This shit is hot."

10:36.267 --> 10:40.267
Yo, yo, Barry Fouray
wants to meet you.

10:40.267 --> 10:43.433
What, that's not dope?

10:43.433 --> 10:46.367
Nah.
Give me the tape.

10:46.367 --> 10:47.700
I-- I don't
have it on me.

10:47.700 --> 10:49.367
Did I say you could play it?

10:49.367 --> 10:51.567
No, but--

10:51.567 --> 10:53.600
You fucked up.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.367
Go get the tape.

10:55.367 --> 10:59.333
But, yo, you're dope.

10:59.333 --> 11:02.133
You get that-- like, you're
really, really dope.

11:02.133 --> 11:03.467
You could be the next--

11:03.467 --> 11:04.967
I ain't interested in being
the next anything.

11:04.967 --> 11:06.300
Tape.

11:06.300 --> 11:10.267
Today.

11:10.267 --> 11:12.200
Okay.

11:27.567 --> 11:31.567
Lenny Fichtelberg from Cold
Chillin' Records, line one.

11:31.567 --> 11:33.500
Last week,
Barry expects for me to pay

11:33.500 --> 11:34.900
for one of his
would-be artists,

11:34.900 --> 11:36.267
now big man Fouray

11:36.267 --> 11:37.733
can't be bothered
to invite me

11:37.733 --> 11:39.833
to Special Ed's
goddamn party, huh?

11:39.833 --> 11:41.300
Oh, no, not at all.

11:41.300 --> 11:43.733
Please let me assure you,
Mr. Fichtelberg.

11:43.733 --> 11:45.700
In no way is this
decision a reflection

11:45.700 --> 11:47.767
on the depth
of Barry's respect.

11:51.867 --> 11:54.633
You gotta cut Damita Alonzo.

11:54.633 --> 11:56.133
Uh, okay, but she works
over at the "Village Voice"

11:56.133 --> 11:57.700
which would be good
for, uh--

11:57.700 --> 12:00.300
Yeah, me and the "Voice"
are massive kemosabes.

12:00.300 --> 12:01.767
But this Damita chick,
who's that?

12:01.767 --> 12:04.933
Third string?
Delete, delete!

12:06.700 --> 12:08.633
Call for you.

12:08.633 --> 12:10.500
Barry Fouray's office.

12:10.500 --> 12:12.067
Hey, what's up?

12:12.067 --> 12:15.333
DeeVee, yo, look, I need
you to take me to see Ahm.

12:15.333 --> 12:16.867
Barry wants to sign him.

12:16.867 --> 12:18.200
He does?
Yup.

12:18.200 --> 12:19.933
Let me just tell Barry
I'm going to meet him

12:19.933 --> 12:21.100
and then I'm there.

12:21.100 --> 12:22.767
All right.

12:32.567 --> 12:36.667
Hi, can I speak to
Damita Alonzo, please?

12:36.667 --> 12:38.533
Uh, hi, Damita,
it's Nikki, long time.

12:38.533 --> 12:40.667
Look, I'm working over
at Fouray Management,

12:40.667 --> 12:42.667
and they're
cancelling your access

12:42.667 --> 12:44.567
to Special Ed's
listening party tonight.

12:44.567 --> 12:47.567
I'm gonna leave a pass for you
at the door under my name.

12:47.567 --> 12:49.400
Hopefully, you can make it?

12:49.400 --> 12:51.533
Uh, okay, bye.

13:10.900 --> 13:14.167
Geronimo ain't
coming back, Bruce.

13:14.167 --> 13:16.733
Neither is Smoke.

13:16.733 --> 13:19.367
So, here's the deal.
This shit ends today.

13:19.367 --> 13:20.633
Truce.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.267
We should body
this nigga right now.

13:22.267 --> 13:24.600
Truce.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.733
Or your mama gonna have to
keep her black dress on.

13:26.733 --> 13:28.833
Understand?

13:42.467 --> 13:44.067
So, what's up with
Kool Chip?

13:44.067 --> 13:46.600
We're doing this new joint
with Salaam and Palm Tree.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.133
Hey, Chuck,
what's happening?

13:48.133 --> 13:50.500
Hey, Bernard, this the kid
I was telling you about.

13:50.500 --> 13:51.600
He's gonna start
helping me out.

13:51.600 --> 13:54.567
Played that PE at WPPS.

13:54.567 --> 13:57.533
Oh, yeah, a rebel.

13:57.533 --> 13:59.400
You must've been a real
hit with Sampson.

14:01.167 --> 14:05.167
You try that shit over here,
I woulda broke your hands.

14:15.133 --> 14:18.267
I'm telling you, man,
that dude got laid out.

14:18.267 --> 14:20.967
That motherfucker lucky
he's still upright.

14:20.967 --> 14:23.700
See, I know Smoke owes on
that restraining shit,

14:23.700 --> 14:26.233
but them niggas violate
again, we gonna have to

14:26.233 --> 14:27.333
let 'em know what's good.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.767
I know.

14:29.767 --> 14:32.333
Well, well, well,
if it ain't Prep School.

14:32.333 --> 14:35.367
And he comes bearing gifts.

14:35.367 --> 14:38.467
How you doing, Ma?
I'm Scooby.

14:38.467 --> 14:40.400
What brings you to
the Fort Greene projects

14:40.400 --> 14:42.400
on this fine,
fine summer day?

14:42.400 --> 14:43.667
Will you just
leave her alone--

14:43.667 --> 14:45.333
I wasn't talking to you.

14:45.333 --> 14:46.867
I was trying to
be fuckin' courteous.

14:46.867 --> 14:48.733
You need to mind your manners
before I fuck you up--

14:48.733 --> 14:49.867
Uh, please
forgive DeeVee.

14:49.867 --> 14:51.667
He's just
a little protective.

14:51.667 --> 14:53.367
Hmm.
It's nice to meet you, Scooby.

14:53.367 --> 14:56.467
You see, fucking manners.

14:56.467 --> 14:58.100
How you doing, Miss, um--

14:58.100 --> 14:59.633
Nikki Jones.
Hmm.

14:59.633 --> 15:00.967
I just wanted to see
if I could talk to Ahm

15:00.967 --> 15:03.133
for a second
if that's cool.

15:03.133 --> 15:06.067
By all means, Nikki Jones.

15:09.367 --> 15:12.833
A'ight.

15:12.833 --> 15:15.967
Hey, Ahm, uh, this is
my friend, Nikki,

15:15.967 --> 15:17.433
and, uh, she works
for Barry Fouray.

15:17.433 --> 15:19.733
You got the tape?
Uh--

15:19.733 --> 15:21.700
Ahm, it is a pleasure
to meet you.

15:21.700 --> 15:23.567
And like DeeVee was saying,
I do work with Barry Fouray.

15:23.567 --> 15:25.467
And we would love to work with
you on your music together.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.067
You got the tape?

15:27.067 --> 15:28.700
I have something much more
important than the tape.

15:28.700 --> 15:30.233
I have an opportunity
of a lifetime.

15:30.233 --> 15:31.467
I don't give a fuck.

15:31.467 --> 15:35.733
Okay.

15:35.733 --> 15:37.333
Listen, I got the tape.

15:37.333 --> 15:38.733
Somebody's
holding it for me

15:38.733 --> 15:40.233
and I can't get it back
from them until tonight.

15:40.233 --> 15:42.067
Fastest way to get
it back into your hands

15:42.067 --> 15:44.367
is if you meet me
in Manhattan.

15:44.367 --> 15:46.367
Come to Rita's,
8:00 p.m.

15:46.367 --> 15:48.233
I'll have it,
I promise.

15:48.233 --> 15:52.167
You should at least hear
what Barry has to say, okay?

15:52.167 --> 15:54.467
Give him five minutes.

15:58.833 --> 16:00.367
He's not very fuckin'
reasonable, is he?

16:00.367 --> 16:01.833
Told you.

16:01.833 --> 16:03.333
Why can't you just give
him a copy of the tape?

16:03.333 --> 16:05.200
'Cause he has the original.

16:05.200 --> 16:06.733
He wants that copy.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.067
We gotta get
that shit back.

16:08.067 --> 16:09.433
Why'd you tell him
you couldn't get it to him

16:09.433 --> 16:10.900
till later on tonight?

16:10.900 --> 16:12.433
We can go to the station
and get it from Chuck

16:12.433 --> 16:13.733
and then bring it
right back.

16:13.733 --> 16:15.100
Barry wants to meet him.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.200
Tell Barry to come here.

16:16.200 --> 16:18.567
He's not gonna do that.

16:18.567 --> 16:22.333
Yo, DeeVee!

16:24.067 --> 16:26.400
Yeah?
Hands against the car.

16:26.400 --> 16:27.800
Wait!
What did I do?

16:27.800 --> 16:28.900
Hands against the car.

16:28.900 --> 16:30.267
What did I--
What did I do?

16:30.267 --> 16:31.600
What are you doing!
You can't arrest him!

16:31.600 --> 16:33.067
DeeVee!
Back up, back up.

16:33.067 --> 16:34.667
What the-- what is your
badge number, asshole?!

16:34.667 --> 16:36.267
What the fuck did you
just call me?

16:36.267 --> 16:37.633
DeeVee!
Back up!

16:37.633 --> 16:41.567
Nikki, stop talking!

16:41.567 --> 16:46.300
Get the tape,
get the tape.

16:46.300 --> 16:50.133
Unh!

17:13.433 --> 17:16.367
Juggy?
Hey, it's Nikki.

17:16.367 --> 17:17.667
No-no-no, Dave is fine.

17:17.667 --> 17:21.067
But... do you know
any lawyers?

17:21.067 --> 17:23.300
Really? Great.

17:23.300 --> 17:25.467
I need a favor.

17:31.800 --> 17:35.267
Hi, I got a call about
my son, Daryl Van Putten, Jr.

17:35.267 --> 17:37.933
Van Putten?
Van Putten, yes.

17:37.933 --> 17:39.867
Let me take a look.

17:46.967 --> 17:48.367
Daryl Van Putten, Jr.

17:48.367 --> 17:50.500
He's being questioned.
Sit down.

18:01.067 --> 18:04.433
Mmm, too frou-frou for
Troy Huggins at Epic?

18:04.433 --> 18:07.367
Nah, that nigga ashier
than a motherfucker.

18:07.367 --> 18:08.800
He could use the lotion.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.633
Now how come y'all ain't
tell me about all this?

18:10.633 --> 18:13.433
We didn't want you
raidin' it for your ladies.

18:13.433 --> 18:15.433
Uh, how about we send
a bottle of George's

18:15.433 --> 18:17.233
to Sampson King
at WPPS?

18:17.233 --> 18:18.800
Ain't sending
Sampson jack.

18:18.800 --> 18:21.133
Not till they start playing
my people on the air, period.

18:21.133 --> 18:23.533
And that go for all the rest
of them motherfuckers in radio.

18:23.533 --> 18:25.067
Nothing but the middle finger

18:25.067 --> 18:26.567
till they give
my people air time.

18:26.567 --> 18:28.233
Now we can give
Sophia Chang this white--

18:28.233 --> 18:29.767
this white wine
picnic basket though.

18:29.767 --> 18:31.200
All right.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.433
Nikki, are you
gettin' all this?

18:32.433 --> 18:33.967
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:33.967 --> 18:35.800
So, just so I'm clear,
we're nixing all of radio

18:35.800 --> 18:37.333
from the list, and we're not
sending gifts to them either?

18:37.333 --> 18:39.433
Damn straight.
They're not all radio.

18:39.433 --> 18:41.400
I'd send something
to Bernard at The Ride

18:41.400 --> 18:43.067
and Joel Sakowitz
at Hot 97.

18:43.067 --> 18:44.167
You know, flies, honey.

18:44.167 --> 18:45.467
Yeah, that's fine,
that's fine.

18:45.467 --> 18:47.267
That's fine, as long as I
get to keep this one

18:47.267 --> 18:49.467
for myself and the after-party,
I'm good, yeah.

18:49.467 --> 18:52.633
Nikki, how did that
meeting go with Ahm?

18:52.633 --> 18:56.067
Great.
He's stopping by tonight.

18:56.067 --> 18:57.700
Good.

18:57.700 --> 18:59.367
You're one of
his runners, right?

18:59.367 --> 19:00.800
One of the guys
who cleans his books?

19:00.800 --> 19:03.733
No, I-I told you guys,
I'm a, I'm a music producer.

19:03.733 --> 19:05.367
You were observed
going in and out of

19:05.367 --> 19:06.900
the Fort Greene
projects today.

19:06.900 --> 19:08.833
No equipment.

19:08.833 --> 19:10.533
Did you guys
make a record?

19:10.533 --> 19:11.900
Not enough time for that.

19:11.900 --> 19:14.833
But perfect to
shore up an alibi.

19:17.433 --> 19:18.833
If we place Mr. Harris

19:18.833 --> 19:21.367
anywhere other than
with you the day

19:21.367 --> 19:23.533
of this murder, my man,

19:23.533 --> 19:26.200
you are looking
at five to seven.

19:26.200 --> 19:28.467
Accessory
after the fact.

19:28.467 --> 19:29.667
They gonna eat your little

19:29.667 --> 19:32.333
candy college ass
up in Rikers.

19:38.433 --> 19:41.833
Jonah Aaron, esquire.

19:41.833 --> 19:44.800
I'm here to see my client,
Daryl Van Putten, Jr.

19:44.800 --> 19:47.100
Hold up, hold up,
your, your client?

19:47.100 --> 19:50.567
Oh, Mr. Van Putten, yeah,
I'm David's father, Juggy.

19:50.567 --> 19:53.633
David Aaron.
DeeVee's friend from GW.

19:53.633 --> 19:55.400
David dates DeeVee's
other friend, Nikki.

19:55.400 --> 19:56.600
Right, right.

19:56.600 --> 19:57.933
Nikki called me,
panicked.

19:57.933 --> 19:59.700
I said I'd get down here
as quick as I could.

19:59.700 --> 20:00.967
Mr. Aaron,
sign right here

20:00.967 --> 20:02.233
and we'll
buzz you in.

20:02.233 --> 20:06.133
Very good.
This way?

20:06.133 --> 20:08.300
Just the lawyer.

20:08.300 --> 20:12.333
It'll be just a minute.

20:12.333 --> 20:14.500
Sir, have a seat.

20:23.833 --> 20:26.667
Thank you, officer.
Good afternoon, detectives.

20:26.667 --> 20:29.167
My name is Jonah Aaron,
attorney at law.

20:29.167 --> 20:31.933
Mr. Van Putten
is my client.

20:31.933 --> 20:36.967
Any further questions
may be submitted in writing.

20:36.967 --> 20:41.000
Along with a subpoena.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.933
Let's go, DeeVee.

20:53.867 --> 20:56.367
You're hurting me!
I don't care.

20:56.367 --> 20:58.733
Look who's here.

20:58.733 --> 21:02.233
Oh!

21:02.233 --> 21:04.167
You good?

21:04.167 --> 21:05.567
Yeah.

21:05.567 --> 21:06.933
What the hell is
the matter with you?

21:06.933 --> 21:08.533
Ow! I'm sorry.

21:08.533 --> 21:12.267
What do we owe you?
Nothing.

21:12.267 --> 21:17.067
I was disbarred
12 years ago.

21:17.067 --> 21:20.867
You be good, boss.

21:20.867 --> 21:23.300
Better come on, boy.

21:23.300 --> 21:26.133
Need to get the hell
out of here.

21:26.133 --> 21:28.700
Yo! What you do!

21:28.700 --> 21:31.933
Stay back!
Back up! Back up!

21:33.800 --> 21:35.067
He's crazy!

21:35.067 --> 21:37.333
What's going on?
My new boss.

21:37.333 --> 21:39.133
Apparently, this is
how he fires people.

21:39.133 --> 21:40.733
He makes Sampson
look like a pussy.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.300
You sure
you wanna work here?

21:42.300 --> 21:43.667
I'm running out
of radio stations.

21:43.667 --> 21:46.133
Where else am I gonna go?
What's up?

21:46.133 --> 21:48.867
Oh, I need that tape from
Chuck Chillout, DeeVee's tape.

21:48.867 --> 21:50.800
Uh, he's going to
meet his cousin.

21:50.800 --> 21:52.467
Is something wrong?

21:52.467 --> 21:55.767
Oh, I gotta--
I gotta go.

21:55.767 --> 21:58.267
Um, have Chuck Chillout bring
it to the listening party, okay?

22:03.233 --> 22:06.700
Check, check-check, one-two,
one-two, that's good?

22:06.700 --> 22:08.500
You hear that?
You can hear me?

22:08.500 --> 22:10.767
Check-check,
one-two, one-two--

22:10.767 --> 22:12.733
Hey, stay away from
those wall outlets, man.

22:12.733 --> 22:15.333
We maxed out at 30 amps.

22:45.200 --> 22:47.933
Nikki?

22:49.867 --> 22:52.600
Sounds different
on this side, doesn't it?

23:06.467 --> 23:08.267
Yo, I just got
off the phone.

23:08.267 --> 23:11.067
Bug got locked up and saw that
kid DeeVee at the station.

23:11.067 --> 23:13.633
Say he was some
lawyers and shit.

23:13.633 --> 23:15.233
Walked out of there
real clean.

23:15.233 --> 23:18.333
He might be snitchin'.

23:18.333 --> 23:20.067
Kid's gotta go.

23:29.367 --> 23:31.300
Dad?

23:31.300 --> 23:32.900
Yo, Ahm is dope, though.

23:32.900 --> 23:35.267
Like, he has a great voice,
great delivery.

23:35.267 --> 23:37.467
He's a drug dealin'
murderer, Junior.

23:37.467 --> 23:38.867
Let me tell you something.

23:38.867 --> 23:41.067
When a thug gets shot,

23:41.067 --> 23:44.500
or worse, when a little kid
gets rolled in on a gurney

23:44.500 --> 23:46.267
'cause of a dealer's bullet,

23:46.267 --> 23:50.133
I'm the one has
to mop up the blood, me.

23:50.133 --> 23:53.600
And here you are, talkin'
about a-- a great voice?

23:53.600 --> 23:54.967
A great delivery.

23:54.967 --> 23:56.300
Try tellin' that shit

23:56.300 --> 23:58.600
to those crying mothers
at the hospital.

23:58.600 --> 24:00.167
"Oh, I'm sorry,
he shot your son

24:00.167 --> 24:01.933
but he has
a great fuckin' voice."

24:01.933 --> 24:02.967
I didn't know, Dad.

24:02.967 --> 24:04.600
Well, you shoulda.

24:04.600 --> 24:06.267
You're smart.

24:06.267 --> 24:09.267
Smarter than me,
and I'm proud of that.

24:09.267 --> 24:11.733
You think I beat the sun up
every morning to--

24:11.733 --> 24:13.767
to carry a mop bucket.

24:13.767 --> 24:15.900
And then you just
drop out of school.

24:15.900 --> 24:20.233
Yeah, for what?
For music?

24:20.233 --> 24:23.367
For you to do a bid
for aiding and abetting,

24:23.367 --> 24:24.400
or even worse, Junior--

24:24.400 --> 24:26.467
Yo, can you lay off?

24:26.467 --> 24:28.633
I'm calling your
Aunt Adona in Charleston.

24:28.633 --> 24:29.800
I'm not going
to South Carolina.

24:29.800 --> 24:31.833
Yes, you are.

24:31.833 --> 24:33.467
And you gonna get away
from this Ahm nigga.

24:33.467 --> 24:37.067
You're gonna do that,
and you're gonna live.

24:39.833 --> 24:41.133
Where the fuck
are you going?

24:41.133 --> 24:42.867
I gotta go-- going
to get some fresh air.

24:42.867 --> 24:44.533
See, that's your problem.

24:44.533 --> 24:45.900
You need to sit
your narrow ass down

24:45.900 --> 24:47.700
and listen for a change.

24:47.700 --> 24:49.667
I gotta go think, Dad.

24:49.667 --> 24:51.400
I'll be back.

24:51.400 --> 24:54.500
Fine.
You go think.

24:59.900 --> 25:02.067
Hey, Damita,
so glad you could make it.

25:02.067 --> 25:06.167
Thanks for the invite.

25:06.167 --> 25:08.600
So, how old is
your daughter now?

25:08.600 --> 25:11.133
1-1/2 years.
Wow.

25:11.133 --> 25:12.500
I can't believe
how quick--

25:12.500 --> 25:13.867
Two years, Nikki.

25:13.867 --> 25:16.167
I know, I know.

25:16.167 --> 25:20.300
It's just, uh...
Things got crazy.

25:22.233 --> 25:24.233
Thanks for getting
my access back.

25:24.233 --> 25:27.133
Let me know if you're
ever really ready to talk.

25:27.133 --> 25:29.067
Otherwise...

25:33.067 --> 25:34.833
Yo, Nikki, tell me
tonight gonna be hot.

25:34.833 --> 25:36.367
We're good.

25:36.367 --> 25:38.300
Sound check done,
drinks are flowing.

25:38.300 --> 25:39.800
Everybody on the
guest list is cool.

25:39.800 --> 25:41.233
Ahm?
Not yet, but he'll be here.

25:41.233 --> 25:42.433
Yeah, what's up, Barry?

25:42.433 --> 25:43.600
Yo, what up, man?

25:43.600 --> 25:44.733
Yeah, it's gonna be
off the hook tonight.

25:44.733 --> 25:46.767
Good to see you.
Yeah, so...

25:46.767 --> 25:48.167
Got it, got it.

25:48.167 --> 25:50.300
Okay, all right.
Mm-hmm.

26:18.833 --> 26:21.933
Heh.
I don't mean to barge in.

26:21.933 --> 26:23.900
Yeah, why?
It's your apartment.

26:23.900 --> 26:27.467
Just, you know,
I wanted to... you know.

26:27.467 --> 26:30.200
Say bye.

26:30.200 --> 26:32.900
Bye? Just moving to
Williamsburg.

26:32.900 --> 26:35.167
Jesus, why would
anyone wanna move there?

26:35.167 --> 26:37.767
It's not like it's Jersey.

26:37.767 --> 26:41.733
Barely.

26:41.733 --> 26:42.933
Do you need any help?

26:42.933 --> 26:45.500
No, I'm good.

26:46.733 --> 26:49.067
Hey-hey!

26:49.067 --> 26:52.433
There's still
some Quik left.

26:52.433 --> 26:54.867
Now I remember
when you were little,

26:54.867 --> 26:57.233
I don't know who used
to drink more of this.

26:57.233 --> 26:59.200
You or me.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.800
You might wanna check
the expiration date on that.

27:01.800 --> 27:05.867
Expiration-- expiration dates
are for folk singers, David.

27:05.867 --> 27:09.800
Expiration date, my ass.

27:09.800 --> 27:11.067
All right.

27:11.067 --> 27:13.167
You know, you and me...

27:13.167 --> 27:16.600
We're, uh, we're
sort of alike, you know?

27:16.600 --> 27:17.733
Yes?

27:17.733 --> 27:19.867
Yeah, how?

27:23.067 --> 27:27.367
We both like Quik.

27:27.367 --> 27:29.533
Mom says
I'm more like her.

27:29.533 --> 27:32.067
Uh, could be.

27:32.067 --> 27:34.333
You're both
awfully principled.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.333
Well...

27:49.067 --> 27:51.133
See you around.

28:17.833 --> 28:19.200
Don't move.

28:19.200 --> 28:20.400
Keep doing what
you were doing.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.067
Don't move or keep
doing what I'm doing?

28:22.067 --> 28:23.933
Both, why can't you?

28:26.800 --> 28:29.433
Okay, about earlier?
I'm sorry.

28:29.433 --> 28:31.400
Between the guest list and
trying to get this artist,

28:31.400 --> 28:33.133
I didn't think.

28:33.133 --> 28:34.833
Can't we just chalk it up
as first day fuck up

28:34.833 --> 28:37.567
for the new girl?

28:37.567 --> 28:40.533
I will do whatever you need
when you have to reshoot.

28:40.533 --> 28:41.967
Okay.

28:41.967 --> 28:44.167
You good?
Yeah.

28:44.167 --> 28:46.833
Damn, you clean up fast.

28:46.833 --> 28:48.300
You waste time...

28:48.300 --> 28:50.100
You waste money!

28:51.700 --> 28:54.767
Don't worry about it.
We all had a first day.

28:54.767 --> 28:56.200
Thanks.

28:56.200 --> 28:57.733
Hey, so I gotta
ask, but...

28:57.733 --> 28:59.300
Oh, the apron?
Yeah.

28:59.300 --> 29:01.167
I work at my
parents' market.

29:01.167 --> 29:02.467
I thought you were--

29:02.467 --> 29:04.067
Technically, I'm
Fouray's art director.

29:04.067 --> 29:07.333
I sell artists, do visual
concepts, graphics, all of it.

29:07.333 --> 29:09.533
But he doesn't pay me.

29:09.533 --> 29:11.100
He lets me use
his space for free.

29:11.100 --> 29:12.733
Hence the dark room.

29:12.733 --> 29:15.300
Yeah, I only get money
for my freelance photography.

29:15.300 --> 29:18.067
But to my parents,
I am just a stock boy.

29:18.067 --> 29:21.233
Girl, you are one
fly fuckin' stock boy.

29:21.233 --> 29:23.200
Thanks, you're not
so bad yourself.

29:25.300 --> 29:27.533
Have you seen
Chuck Chillout?

29:27.533 --> 29:30.167
Not in the 90 seconds
I've been here.

29:30.167 --> 29:31.733
Okay, thanks.

29:49.100 --> 29:50.433
You got the tape?

29:50.433 --> 29:53.933
Shit.
I must've left it inside.

29:53.933 --> 29:55.267
Yeah, Barry's got a table.

29:55.267 --> 29:56.333
Why don't you just
come in and meet him?

29:56.333 --> 29:59.333
Nah.
Go get the tape.

30:01.700 --> 30:03.633
Now.

30:10.100 --> 30:13.367
Hey, you seen
Chuck Chillout?

30:13.367 --> 30:16.000
This is the problem,
The Mission ain't the scene.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.900
Come on,
let's move with this.

30:17.900 --> 30:19.333
I appreciate
your passion, Barry,

30:19.333 --> 30:22.133
but we have a better chance
on MTV with The Mission.

30:22.133 --> 30:23.933
Just trust me on this, okay?
Enjoy the party.

30:23.933 --> 30:26.933
Yeah.

30:26.933 --> 30:28.067
I got Ahm
waiting outside.

30:28.067 --> 30:29.500
Great, tell him
to come inside.

30:29.500 --> 30:30.900
Any chance you
could come meet him?

30:30.900 --> 30:32.100
He seems kind of shy.

30:32.100 --> 30:33.500
Well, he better
get over it.

30:33.500 --> 30:36.633
Tell him either come
inside or to go home.

30:36.633 --> 30:38.667
His name ain't Prince.

30:38.667 --> 30:40.400
All right, now,
did you order my flowers?

30:40.400 --> 30:41.633
Arriving as we speak.

30:41.633 --> 30:44.267
Not bad, Nikki Jones.
But go get your boy.

30:44.267 --> 30:46.200
Why do I have to explain
to motherfuckers

30:46.200 --> 30:47.700
that the sky is blue?

30:47.700 --> 30:49.133
Thought you were
gonna tell him no.

30:49.133 --> 30:51.033
Tell 'em we making video.

30:51.033 --> 30:52.567
I thought the label
would do that...

31:14.833 --> 31:18.300
What happened?!

31:18.300 --> 31:21.667
Turn the lights on!
Turn the lights on!

31:26.633 --> 31:29.267
Hey, hey, hey!

31:29.267 --> 31:31.400
It's not what
it looks like, I--

31:33.367 --> 31:35.367
Excuse me, excuse me.
Hey, watch it!

31:35.367 --> 31:37.900
Hey, be cool, everybody,
don't worry about it.

31:37.900 --> 31:40.067
The lights will
be back on in a second.

31:40.067 --> 31:41.600
Drink your drinks
and you'll act

31:41.600 --> 31:43.067
like you at a high school party
or something like that...

31:43.067 --> 31:44.433
Hey, I need to
take Barry outside.

31:44.433 --> 31:45.933
I need you
to do me a favor.

31:45.933 --> 31:48.067
In five minutes,
don't let anybody leave.

31:48.067 --> 31:49.067
How am I gonna do that?

31:49.067 --> 31:50.733
You'll figure it out.

31:50.733 --> 31:52.067
We gonna keep
the lights out!

31:52.067 --> 31:53.300
Some of y'all look better
in the dark

31:53.300 --> 31:54.567
if you know what
I'm talking about.

31:54.567 --> 31:55.667
Hey, excuse me, Barry,

31:55.667 --> 31:56.867
I was thinking
it might be a good idea

31:56.867 --> 31:58.200
to go out now and meet Ahm

31:58.200 --> 31:59.500
'cause we can't really
do the event in the dark.

31:59.500 --> 32:01.633
Nah, 'cause I'm MC-ing
right now...

32:01.633 --> 32:02.867
But we got you.

32:02.867 --> 32:04.100
Josie said she would
make sure she lets us know

32:04.100 --> 32:05.433
when the lights
come back on.

32:05.433 --> 32:07.333
Plus, we got plenty
of people to work the room.

32:07.333 --> 32:09.433
But, the hottest,
undiscovered MC in New York

32:09.433 --> 32:11.267
might drive away
if you don't go outside.

32:11.267 --> 32:12.367
Barry, let me talk to you--

32:12.367 --> 32:14.433
Stop! Okay, five minutes.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.400
He's in the black
Pathfinder right out front.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.400
Out front?
Uh-huh.

32:18.400 --> 32:20.267
Yo, Chuck, I've been
looking for you all day.

32:20.267 --> 32:21.767
You got DeeVee's tape?

32:21.767 --> 32:23.167
Sorry, sis, it's in my ride,

32:23.167 --> 32:25.967
but my dumb-ass cousin
got it stolen in Jersey.

32:25.967 --> 32:28.100
What?!
Sorry, kiddo.

32:48.067 --> 32:50.067
Yo, crazy how the lights
went off in there, huh?

32:50.067 --> 32:51.967
Bananas.

32:51.967 --> 32:53.533
So, you really think
your man got it?

32:53.533 --> 32:55.333
Yo, I'm telling you, we're
looking at the next Rakim.

32:55.333 --> 32:57.533
Oh, yeah, well,
where's Eric B?

32:57.533 --> 32:59.567
Uh, family stuff,
but he'll be by later.

32:59.567 --> 33:01.967
Okay, a'ight, Nikki Jones,
let me find out--

33:01.967 --> 33:03.633
Look.

33:03.633 --> 33:05.567
That's him?

33:10.767 --> 33:14.267
Yo!
Yo, stop, yo!

33:14.267 --> 33:18.567
Hey, hey!

33:18.567 --> 33:22.233
Hey, I got your tape, here.

33:22.233 --> 33:24.800
Can you give
Barry five minutes?

33:24.800 --> 33:26.067
Barry Fouray,
this is Ahm.

33:26.067 --> 33:28.167
Ahm, this is
Barry Fouray.

33:42.167 --> 33:45.467
Yeah, I like
your office.

33:45.467 --> 33:48.500
Yeah, I'm glad you
came down, you know.

33:48.500 --> 33:51.600
The joint you and your boy
did, that shit is dope.

33:51.600 --> 33:52.833
Appreciate it.

33:52.833 --> 33:54.833
Yeah, y'all working
on a whole album?

33:54.833 --> 33:56.833
Something like that.

33:56.833 --> 33:59.867
Well, if it's anything
like this first joint,

33:59.867 --> 34:02.467
then the whole sky's gonna
open up to you, man.

34:02.467 --> 34:04.400
You're gonna find yourself
needing a strong team

34:04.400 --> 34:07.133
to help you handle
your business correctly.

34:07.133 --> 34:09.433
I can handle
my own business.

34:09.433 --> 34:12.133
No doubt,
you can do that, but...

34:12.133 --> 34:13.800
You know, when you
dealing with a label

34:13.800 --> 34:15.633
and they steppin' to you,
showing you some bullshit

34:15.633 --> 34:17.633
advance gonna
look like a lot of money.

34:17.633 --> 34:19.367
And then they gonna
try to put you

34:19.367 --> 34:21.267
in a short position
for your artist share.

34:21.267 --> 34:24.467
The what?
Artist share.

34:24.467 --> 34:26.500
You know what that is?

34:26.500 --> 34:28.467
It's like a,
it's like a...

34:28.467 --> 34:31.067
Are you familiar
with points on a package?

34:31.067 --> 34:32.967
I heard somebody talk
about it once.

34:32.967 --> 34:35.067
Well, it's like that
except for this package

34:35.067 --> 34:36.533
don't come with the drama.

34:36.533 --> 34:37.867
You know what I'm saying?

34:37.867 --> 34:39.200
And, like, the labels
wanna walk you out

34:39.200 --> 34:41.300
on eight points,
ten points.

34:41.300 --> 34:42.967
Especially if you new?
Forget about it.

34:42.967 --> 34:46.100
But we, we deal with it,
like, hard in that department.

34:46.100 --> 34:48.267
We want 12 points.

34:48.267 --> 34:49.733
We want 14 points.

34:49.733 --> 34:51.333
You know what I'm saying?
We want the advance.

34:51.333 --> 34:54.567
But I'm willing to sacrifice
the advance if it means

34:54.567 --> 34:56.400
that my artist is in
the better long-term position.

34:56.400 --> 34:58.067
You know what I'm saying?

34:58.067 --> 35:00.867
Ain't nobody expecting this
shit to last forever, man.

35:00.867 --> 35:02.933
Except for me.

35:02.933 --> 35:06.200
So you a middle man.

35:06.200 --> 35:08.567
Not the label.

35:08.567 --> 35:13.100
No, I negotiate with the label
on behalf of the artist.

35:13.100 --> 35:14.667
Thanks for your time, man.

35:28.567 --> 35:30.467
No, your man ain't ready.

35:30.467 --> 35:32.333
He's ready,
you heard...

35:32.333 --> 35:35.700
Your man ain't ready!

35:35.700 --> 35:39.633
Outside the car, I don't
know what to tell you.

36:19.100 --> 36:20.900
Fuck it.
I'm starting my own label.

37:19.300 --> 37:21.067
Hey.

37:21.067 --> 37:24.367
You will not believe what
went down at Rita's tonight.

37:28.433 --> 37:31.067
What's up?

37:31.067 --> 37:33.100
I talked to DeeVee.

37:33.100 --> 37:35.767
Juggy?

37:35.767 --> 37:38.967
You call fucking Juggy to get
our friend out of jail.

37:38.967 --> 37:41.600
What was I supposed to do?
He needed help.

37:41.600 --> 37:44.233
Call me!
Call his dad!

37:44.233 --> 37:45.800
Don't call
fuckin' Juggy.

37:45.800 --> 37:48.200
DeeVee's dad wasn't home,
Juggy was.

37:48.200 --> 37:50.067
What about me, Nikki?

37:50.067 --> 37:52.500
Come on, David.
Our friend was in jail.

37:52.500 --> 37:54.100
I'm supposed to just
let him sit in a cell

37:54.100 --> 37:56.233
because you got
daddy issues?

37:56.233 --> 37:57.633
That is fucked up.

37:57.633 --> 37:59.067
What's fucked up is me
feeling like I'm on trial

37:59.067 --> 38:03.433
when I come home
every single fuckin' night.

38:15.433 --> 38:17.800
Want a ride,
Prep School?

38:17.800 --> 38:20.433
Uh, nah, I'm good,
I'ma just--

38:20.433 --> 38:24.567
I ain't askin'.

38:50.600 --> 38:52.500
This season on "The Breaks"...

38:52.500 --> 38:54.067
It's game time, baby.

38:54.067 --> 38:55.800
Hip-hop is gonna take
over the music business.

38:55.800 --> 38:58.167
Fouray Records
is gonna be a force.

38:58.167 --> 39:02.100
I heard you might be adding
hip-hop to your repertoire.

39:02.100 --> 39:04.933
My chairman says there's
gold in them there hills.

39:04.933 --> 39:07.167
Listen up!
I got a new label!

39:07.167 --> 39:08.567
I'm looking for a star.

39:08.567 --> 39:11.333
I got a question for Barry.
You a leech, boy!

39:11.333 --> 39:13.567
You wouldn't be
nothing without me!

39:18.833 --> 39:20.667
We don't change our
artists' music and image

39:20.667 --> 39:22.300
so they can fit
the mainstream.

39:22.300 --> 39:24.067
We make the mainstream
flow to us.

39:24.067 --> 39:26.200
If you wanna make a living
in the music industry?

39:26.200 --> 39:28.167
You're gonna have to get
your hands a little dirty.

39:28.167 --> 39:30.700
This bitch is more man than
your bitch-ass will ever be

39:30.700 --> 39:32.500
Yeah!

39:32.500 --> 39:34.633
I heard your demo,
and I'd like to talk to you

39:34.633 --> 39:36.067
about joining Fouray.

39:36.067 --> 39:38.333
What exactly is Fouray
gonna do for my baby?

39:38.333 --> 39:39.800
He's gonna
make her a star.

39:48.167 --> 39:49.500
Got word you may
know something

39:49.500 --> 39:51.433
about a homicide
in Crown Heights?

39:51.433 --> 39:53.533
No.
What did you tell 'em?

39:53.533 --> 39:56.433
Nothing.
You sure?

39:56.433 --> 39:58.533
You lose this case, it's over,
you lose everything.

39:58.533 --> 39:59.667
You are a hustler.

39:59.667 --> 40:01.400
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

40:01.400 --> 40:04.033
You reap what you sow.

40:04.033 --> 40:07.667
In this business, the only
color that matters is green.

40:07.667 --> 40:09.500
Do I gotta keep
looking over my shoulder?

40:09.500 --> 40:11.867
It's New York City, man.

40:11.867 --> 40:13.900
You always gotta
look over your shoulder.

40:13.900 --> 40:15.433
There's a lot of
troubled souls out there.

40:15.433 --> 40:17.533
Is yourself included?
Number one.

40:17.533 --> 40:20.367
If you gon' make music,
I want you to make history.

40:20.367 --> 40:22.400
That's the program!

40:22.400 --> 40:24.967
You either with it
or you not!

40:27.167 --> 40:29.500
Do you know how many people
spend their entire lives

40:29.500 --> 40:31.333
wishing for a chance
at greatness?
