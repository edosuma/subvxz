He said that
you guys were, too.

10:13.177 --> 10:15.440
Look, I don't know
if I could be of much help.

10:15.484 --> 10:16.920
It all happened so fast.

10:16.964 --> 10:18.748
- No, if there's anything
that you remember,

10:18.792 --> 10:21.316
anything at all
would be great help.

10:22.665 --> 10:23.927
- I was...

10:23.971 --> 10:27.757
I was under a scaffold, and...

10:27.801 --> 10:30.064
I came to a zigzag in it...

10:30.107 --> 10:33.154
and I heard somebody behind me,
so I turned

10:33.197 --> 10:35.156
and that's when
I felt this jolt.

10:35.199 --> 10:37.637
- We think that you were tased.

10:37.680 --> 10:38.812
- Knocked me off my feet.

10:38.855 --> 10:40.770
Then the guy...

10:40.814 --> 10:42.859
he bends me over the scaffold.

10:44.992 --> 10:47.516
Pulled down my pants,
and then...

10:47.559 --> 10:48.648
- It's okay.

10:48.691 --> 10:50.432
Take your time.

10:50.475 --> 10:53.783
- He started yelling all these
horrible things at me.

10:53.827 --> 10:55.829
He was calling me the F word.

10:55.872 --> 10:57.482
And the N word.

10:57.526 --> 10:59.659
- You get a look at him
before you were tased?

10:59.702 --> 11:00.921
- I just got a glimpse of him.

11:00.964 --> 11:03.663
He was a big,
scary-looking guy.

11:03.706 --> 11:05.316
- White, black?

11:05.360 --> 11:06.840
- White.

11:06.883 --> 11:09.973
Long hair, a beard, maybe,
and a hoodie.

11:10.017 --> 11:12.802
Like I said,
it all happened so fast.

11:12.846 --> 11:15.196
- So, Mathis,
you should know that we think

11:15.239 --> 11:19.591
that the man who assaulted
you may be a serial predator.

11:19.635 --> 11:21.115
- What?
- Yeah, he's attacking

11:21.158 --> 11:23.421
black gay men
in Hell's Kitchen.

11:23.465 --> 11:24.814
- That's horrible.

11:24.858 --> 11:26.903
I mean, I'm not gay, but...

11:26.947 --> 11:29.036
you mean just because
the color of my skin,

11:29.079 --> 11:31.168
and because I was walking
down those streets...

11:31.212 --> 11:33.518
- Did you stop
anywhere on your walk?

11:33.562 --> 11:35.346
- No.

11:35.390 --> 11:36.521
No, I was...

11:36.565 --> 11:38.393
I was just getting some air.

11:38.436 --> 11:40.438
Like, that's all.
I'm walking after midnight.

11:43.137 --> 11:46.270
You know what, guys, I'm sorry,
I'm getting really tired.

11:46.314 --> 11:48.446
Do you think that
we can do this later?

11:48.490 --> 11:50.057
- Of course.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.407
- If you remember
anything else, call us.

11:54.931 --> 11:56.977
- Thank you.

11:59.980 --> 12:02.025
He's crashing.
Doesn't remember much.

12:02.069 --> 12:03.287
- Well, this may help.

12:03.331 --> 12:04.767
I caught something
on Instagram.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.943
Mathis stopped
by a bar last night.

12:06.987 --> 12:08.379
Someone took a selfie.

12:08.423 --> 12:09.816
- Doesn't look too happy
about that.

12:09.859 --> 12:12.079
- #SummerSweat.

12:12.122 --> 12:14.255
- I guess Mathis
didn't walk straight home.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.172
- What, the cops
are on Instagram?

12:18.215 --> 12:19.739
- Yeah, Mathis looked
pretty pissed

12:19.782 --> 12:21.088
at you in that picture.

12:21.131 --> 12:22.393
- No, no, those guys
just forget

12:22.437 --> 12:23.873
that their fans
make them who they are.

12:23.917 --> 12:25.222
- Is that why you
went at it with him?

12:25.266 --> 12:26.876
The bartender said
you threatened him.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.270
- No, that was just drama,
all right?

12:29.313 --> 12:30.358
I don't like tourists.

12:30.401 --> 12:32.273
- What do you mean?

12:32.316 --> 12:34.492
- Honey, Mathis is so deep
in the closet,

12:34.536 --> 12:35.972
he went past Narnia.

12:36.016 --> 12:38.235
- And that makes you mad?

12:38.279 --> 12:40.890
They're saying security cam
saw Mathis leave the bar

12:40.934 --> 12:42.544
after you two got into it.

12:42.587 --> 12:43.545
And did you follow him?

12:43.588 --> 12:44.807
- No, I did not follow him.

12:44.851 --> 12:46.896
- You didn't follow him?
- No, I...

12:46.940 --> 12:48.898
I went uptown to meet someone.

12:48.942 --> 12:50.508
- Okay, someone got a name?

12:50.552 --> 12:52.467
- I didn't ask.

12:52.510 --> 12:55.209
Listen, I'll pull up
his Grindr profile for you.

12:55.252 --> 12:56.253
Spoiler alert.

12:56.297 --> 12:58.038
He looks nothing
like his picture.

13:01.128 --> 13:02.390
- We had a suspect
who got into a fight

13:02.433 --> 13:03.870
with Mathis at a gay bar.

13:03.913 --> 13:06.263
- So he didn't tell us
that he went into the bar.

13:06.307 --> 13:07.961
- I don't have to remind you
it's not unusual

13:08.004 --> 13:09.919
for victims
to leave out details

13:09.963 --> 13:10.833
that might make them look--

13:10.877 --> 13:12.095
- Gay.

13:12.139 --> 13:14.141
- Is he straight,
or claims to be?

13:14.184 --> 13:16.447
- He's not gonna cave
on that any time soon.

13:16.491 --> 13:19.799
- He's high profile.
We have a serial out there.

13:19.842 --> 13:22.758
He has a civic obligation,
Captain.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.847
- You want me to shame
a celebrity

13:24.891 --> 13:26.544
into coming out of the closet

13:26.588 --> 13:28.155
so you can publicize the case?

13:28.198 --> 13:29.852
- I wouldn't say shame.

13:29.896 --> 13:30.984
Motivate.

13:32.855 --> 13:33.943
Excuse me.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.775
- Yo, I just want to thank all
my fans for the well wishes.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.691
Look, I can't say too much
right now, but don't worry.

13:42.734 --> 13:44.127
Your boy's gonna make it.

13:44.171 --> 13:45.650
I'm gonna hit
y'all later, okay?

13:45.694 --> 13:47.304
Peace.

13:47.348 --> 13:50.830
Hey, sorry about that.
My fans are concerned.

13:50.873 --> 13:53.615
- Well, so are we, Mathis.

13:53.658 --> 13:58.359
Someone is out there,
preying on gay men.

13:58.402 --> 14:01.014
Gay men who are afraid
to come forward,

14:01.057 --> 14:03.668
to file a police report.

14:03.712 --> 14:08.021
- Mathis, your music means
a lot to people of all types.

14:08.064 --> 14:09.457
If you were to come forward--

14:09.500 --> 14:10.675
- If you did that,

14:10.719 --> 14:11.676
everyone would think
he was gay.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.504
- Look, hold up, Fisch.

14:13.548 --> 14:16.072
- So you think that if I made
a public statement, that--

14:16.116 --> 14:17.030
that it would matter?

14:17.073 --> 14:18.161
- No doubt.

14:18.205 --> 14:19.946
- More than you can imagine.

14:19.989 --> 14:21.251
- Come on, man.

14:21.295 --> 14:22.339
- Look,
who cares if some people

14:22.383 --> 14:24.037
choose to think that I'm gay?

14:27.040 --> 14:28.998
This is bigger than Mathis now.

14:37.528 --> 14:37.746
.

14:37.789 --> 14:39.922
- What happened to me
can happen to anyone.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.706
There's a predator out there.

14:41.750 --> 14:44.666
It's targeting members
of our community.

14:44.709 --> 14:47.190
- Our community.
He outed himself.

14:47.234 --> 14:49.671
- I didn't think that
he was ready to go that far.

14:49.714 --> 14:51.368
That's pretty brave.

14:51.412 --> 14:52.848
- Well, it's helping us.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.764
I mean, the story
went viral overnight.

14:55.807 --> 14:57.809
- This has led me
to self-discovery.

14:59.289 --> 15:01.683
Like many gay black men,

15:01.726 --> 15:03.946
I felt compelled
to live a lie.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.992
I just want to thank you guys.

15:07.776 --> 15:11.736
I looked into
that man's eyes...

15:11.780 --> 15:14.043
and I saw the hatred
in his heart.

15:14.087 --> 15:18.047
This experience,
even as horrible as it was...

15:18.091 --> 15:20.354
- Dad.

15:20.397 --> 15:22.660
- Hey.
- Ken, good to see you.

15:22.704 --> 15:24.401
- This is DeVonn Thompson.

15:24.445 --> 15:25.837
I told him anything
he says here,

15:25.881 --> 15:27.578
you'll keep confidential.

15:29.885 --> 15:32.975
- I was leaving a bar.
"Swank."

15:33.019 --> 15:34.977
- In Hell's Kitchen?

15:35.021 --> 15:37.588
- It's low-key.

15:37.632 --> 15:39.851
I mostly keep to myself.

15:39.895 --> 15:42.767
Someone starts
a conversation, okay.

15:42.811 --> 15:44.508
- Anybody talk to you
that night?

15:44.552 --> 15:47.424
- No. I headed home.

15:47.468 --> 15:49.383
I was going to the E train,

15:49.426 --> 15:51.341
walked down under scaffolding,

15:51.385 --> 15:53.996
and they said someone tased me.

15:54.040 --> 15:54.954
Used a bottle.

15:57.391 --> 15:58.609
I came to in the ambulance.

15:58.653 --> 16:01.525
- So you didn't
get a look at him?

16:01.569 --> 16:03.179
They say anything?

16:03.223 --> 16:04.659
- Not that I heard.

16:04.702 --> 16:07.096
- And how often
do you go to this bar?

16:07.140 --> 16:09.011
- Tuesdays.

16:09.055 --> 16:11.840
My family thinks I'm going out
with the choir after practice.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.888
- Has anyone
ever approached you

16:16.932 --> 16:20.022
on another Tuesday
that seemed odd?

16:21.371 --> 16:23.895
- Yeah, actually...

16:23.939 --> 16:26.637
about a month before,
I was outside smoking.

16:26.681 --> 16:28.988
This white guy, drunk,
asked for a cigarette.

16:29.031 --> 16:32.034
He saw they were menthol.
He gave me a hard time.

16:32.078 --> 16:33.514
- How so?

16:33.557 --> 16:34.819
- He said...

16:36.560 --> 16:38.127
Your wife know you smoke those?

16:38.171 --> 16:40.521
- What, like he made you?

16:40.564 --> 16:42.827
- I got a bad vibe.
Went back inside.

16:42.871 --> 16:45.047
- Is it possible
that this guy was there

16:45.091 --> 16:47.354
the night
you were assaulted?

16:47.397 --> 16:49.095
- I didn't see him.

16:49.138 --> 16:50.139
[knocking at door]

16:51.445 --> 16:53.142
- Hey.
- Excuse me.

16:57.407 --> 16:58.452
- Another vic called.
A broker.

16:58.495 --> 16:59.888
He saw Mathis on TV,

16:59.931 --> 17:01.846
and he said I can come
downtown to talk to him

17:01.890 --> 17:04.153
if I pretend to be a client.

17:04.197 --> 17:06.677
- So he's on the low too.

17:06.721 --> 17:10.116
Ask him if he remembers
anyone asking about his wife.

17:18.559 --> 17:20.430
- My wife and my kids.

17:20.474 --> 17:22.345
He asked if they'd be up
when I got home.

17:22.389 --> 17:23.694
- Do you remember
when this was?

17:23.738 --> 17:25.522
- July 23rd, Tuesday.

17:25.566 --> 17:26.828
I came back into the city.

17:26.871 --> 17:28.786
- Okay. And you said
he was blue-collar?

17:28.830 --> 17:32.573
- Rough, dirty-looking,
reddish hair.

17:32.616 --> 17:34.183
- Could he have followed you?

17:34.227 --> 17:36.664
- I guess, but I didn't see
who tased me.

17:36.707 --> 17:39.145
- What about his voice?
Did he say anything?

17:39.188 --> 17:40.189
- Not a word.

17:40.233 --> 17:42.365
All I remember...

17:42.409 --> 17:44.672
When he was...

17:44.715 --> 17:46.369
assaulting me,

17:46.413 --> 17:50.112
I could see the toes of his
boots covered with paint.

17:50.156 --> 17:51.635
- Six days ago?

17:51.679 --> 17:55.726
- Yeah. Tuesday,
I visited my mother,

17:55.770 --> 17:57.119
and got a beer on the way home.

17:57.163 --> 18:00.122
- Okay, when you stopped
at the bar...

18:00.166 --> 18:01.950
do you remember anybody
asking you

18:01.993 --> 18:04.257
about your wife or your family?

18:04.300 --> 18:06.650
- Earlier that evening.

18:06.694 --> 18:09.871
Tall guy, white, thuggish,
trying to pry.

18:09.914 --> 18:11.655
I shut that down.

18:11.699 --> 18:12.830
My two worlds
must run on separate tracks.

18:12.874 --> 18:14.832
You understand?

18:14.876 --> 18:16.617
- Yeah. I'm just trying
to catch this guy.

18:19.794 --> 18:21.926
- Thanks for waiting.
What do we have?

18:21.970 --> 18:23.798
- Well, four victims,
all assaulted

18:23.841 --> 18:25.930
after leaving bars
in Hell's Kitchen.

18:25.974 --> 18:28.019
The perp knows
the neighborhood.

18:28.063 --> 18:31.588
He surprises all his vics
in isolated, scaffolded areas.

18:31.632 --> 18:33.242
- All tased and assaulted
with a bottle.

18:33.286 --> 18:35.114
- And this hasn't gotten
to the grand jury why?

18:35.157 --> 18:37.116
- Because these victims
won't testify.

18:37.159 --> 18:39.335
- They'll testify
if we subpoena them.

18:39.379 --> 18:40.945
- Counselor,
these men lead double lives

18:40.989 --> 18:42.382
that we ought not
force them to reveal.

18:42.425 --> 18:43.992
They are helping us
to find the pattern.

18:44.035 --> 18:45.515
- Right,
the first three assaults

18:45.559 --> 18:46.603
were on Tuesday nights.

18:46.647 --> 18:47.996
Mathis was last Friday.

18:48.039 --> 18:49.780
- So Mathis is the only one

18:49.824 --> 18:51.739
who saw his assailants
come forward.

18:51.782 --> 18:53.654
The other three only remember

18:53.697 --> 18:56.961
a tense interaction with a big,
red-haired man at their bars.

18:57.005 --> 18:59.138
- And this is who they saw.
That's Mathis' sketch.

18:59.181 --> 19:01.183
- You've noticed
the sketches diverge?

19:01.227 --> 19:02.315
The MO is different too.

19:02.358 --> 19:03.751
Mathis saw the guy.

19:03.794 --> 19:06.145
He also heard him
say gay and racist slurs.

19:06.188 --> 19:07.798
- Which could be our perp
escalating or devolving--

19:07.842 --> 19:09.060
- Or both.
Right.

19:09.104 --> 19:10.410
- We can't have
another assault.

19:10.453 --> 19:12.934
Today's Tuesday.
We flood the zone tonight.

19:12.977 --> 19:15.023
- Chief,
I don't have the manpower.

19:15.066 --> 19:16.807
- You will now.
I'll borrow UCs

19:16.851 --> 19:18.896
from Street Crimes
for every bar on the list.

19:18.940 --> 19:21.769
- Black UCs that read
as upper middle class,

19:21.812 --> 19:23.205
late 30s,
sophisticated?

19:23.249 --> 19:24.467
- Not a lot of those
in Street Crime.

19:24.511 --> 19:26.165
- You know what, Chief?

19:26.208 --> 19:30.038
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you're his type.

19:32.867 --> 19:35.174
[dramatic musical sting]

19:48.274 --> 19:50.972
- That's, what,
the fifth guy in an hour?

19:51.015 --> 19:52.756
- The Chief can pull.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.715
- Look at you.

19:54.758 --> 19:56.978
Handsome,
sitting by yourself,

19:57.021 --> 19:59.154
playing all so hard to get.

20:02.070 --> 20:05.639
- Gay bars, straight bars,
pickup lines are always so sad.

20:05.682 --> 20:06.640
- If you say so.

20:06.683 --> 20:08.032
- Please.

20:08.076 --> 20:09.904
- All right,
it's almost closing time.

20:09.947 --> 20:11.601
Chief did his job.
Just not our night.

20:11.645 --> 20:15.997
- Okay, nothing from the UCs
at the other bars, either.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.259
I'll text the captain.

20:17.303 --> 20:19.740
- You sure I can't
buy you a drink?

20:19.783 --> 20:21.394
- Thanks,
I'm waiting for a friend.

20:21.437 --> 20:23.265
- I can be your friend.

20:23.309 --> 20:24.397
- Another time.

20:34.885 --> 20:36.452
- Whoa, whoa,
hold up, hold up.

20:36.496 --> 20:37.714
Incoming.

20:37.758 --> 20:40.021
- Here we go.

20:40.064 --> 20:42.023
- Some guys can't take a hint.

20:43.111 --> 20:45.113
- Haven't seen you around here.

20:45.156 --> 20:47.376
- You can't been around here.

20:47.420 --> 20:48.682
Buy you a drink?

20:48.725 --> 20:51.772
- Thanks.
It's late.

20:51.815 --> 20:52.729
Wish you'd come in earlier.

20:52.773 --> 20:54.035
- White guy, red hair.

20:54.078 --> 20:55.254
- Fits the profile.

20:55.297 --> 20:56.211
- Yeah, it does.

20:57.778 --> 21:00.302
- Gotta get home to the wife?

21:00.346 --> 21:01.347
- Am I that obvious?

21:01.390 --> 21:03.087
- Maybe not to her.

21:05.786 --> 21:08.789
- You know what?
I really should go.

21:09.746 --> 21:11.095
- Safe home, Cinderella.

21:11.139 --> 21:12.967
What happens after midnight?

21:13.010 --> 21:14.360
You turn straight?

21:32.029 --> 21:33.074
- Let's move.

21:33.117 --> 21:34.902
- No, you stay put, Counselor.

21:34.945 --> 21:36.077
You want to make
yourself useful,

21:36.120 --> 21:38.079
get that napkin for DNA.

21:38.122 --> 21:40.342
- Rollins.
- On it.

21:40.386 --> 21:41.822
- All eyes.

21:41.865 --> 21:43.606
The suspect
is following the Chief.

21:43.650 --> 21:46.827
He's wearing a denim shirt,
jeans, and work boots.

22:04.410 --> 22:05.976
- Waiting for your prince?
Got something for you.

22:06.020 --> 22:08.370
- Hey! NYPD.
Put it down.

22:08.414 --> 22:10.459
Drop it.

22:10.503 --> 22:11.982
Get your hands up.

22:12.026 --> 22:13.506
- Jeez.
I was going for a walk.

22:13.549 --> 22:14.985
- You all right, Chief?

22:15.029 --> 22:16.465
- Glad you made it
before he tased me.

22:16.509 --> 22:18.598
- I didn't do
anything wrong, man.

22:18.641 --> 22:19.860
It's for protection.

22:19.903 --> 22:21.383
- Keep talking,
Prince Charming.

22:21.427 --> 22:23.864
You're under arrest.

22:32.002 --> 22:32.351
.

22:32.394 --> 22:34.353
- Just 'cause
it's got a rainbow flag,

22:34.396 --> 22:35.571
I'm not supposed to go
into a bar

22:35.615 --> 22:37.138
built with brick
my grandfather laid?

22:37.181 --> 22:39.140
I grew up in Hell's Kitchen.
Before these people came here--

22:39.183 --> 22:40.402
- These people.

22:40.446 --> 22:43.144
What, gay people,
or black episode?

22:43.187 --> 22:44.450
Or both?

22:44.493 --> 22:45.407
You like seeing
the neighborhood

22:45.451 --> 22:47.148
change like that?

22:47.191 --> 22:48.845
- Put the bait and tackle
back in the box, Detective.

22:48.889 --> 22:50.760
My client just wants
to clear this up and go home.

22:50.804 --> 22:53.546
- Sure. The bartender says
you're a regular on Tuesdays.

22:53.589 --> 22:55.417
- Yeah, I see my parole officer
on Tuesdays,

22:55.461 --> 22:56.723
do my urine test,

22:56.766 --> 22:57.854
I treat myself
to a few beers after.

22:57.898 --> 22:59.421
- To be clear,

22:59.465 --> 23:02.206
the urine test
is for narcotics, not alcohol.

23:02.250 --> 23:04.818
- You're right.
- Right?

23:04.861 --> 23:06.820
- Moran was released
from Greenhaven four months ago

23:06.863 --> 23:08.604
after a three-year
bid on assault.

23:08.648 --> 23:10.258
He's got a rap sheet
going back to his childhood.

23:10.301 --> 23:11.477
- Sexual assaults
or hate crimes?

23:11.520 --> 23:13.174
- Neither,
but he fits the profile.

23:13.217 --> 23:15.785
- And he obviously has
a problem with gays and blacks.

23:15.829 --> 23:17.396
We caught him following Garland
with a stun gun in his hand,

23:17.439 --> 23:18.919
and a bottle in his pocket.

23:18.962 --> 23:21.225
- I know the attorney.
He'll find the holes.

23:21.269 --> 23:22.749
Call the victims
and do a lineup.

23:22.792 --> 23:25.186
- Well, the first three
can only put him at the bar.

23:25.229 --> 23:26.492
They didn't see
their assailant.

23:26.535 --> 23:28.972
- But Mathis did?

23:29.016 --> 23:29.930
Bring him in.

23:32.759 --> 23:34.021
- My brother's
still got a way to go.

23:34.064 --> 23:35.326
I don't know
if now is a good time.

23:35.370 --> 23:36.589
- It's gonna have to be.

23:37.807 --> 23:39.156
- Mathis.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.506
Hey. I'm Detective Rollins.

23:40.549 --> 23:42.072
This is Sergeant Tutuola,
you remember.

23:42.116 --> 23:43.596
Looking better.

23:43.639 --> 23:47.034
- Yeah. What's been helping,
the love of my fans.

23:47.077 --> 23:49.079
My friends.

23:49.123 --> 23:50.733
I feel so blessed.

23:50.777 --> 23:52.692
- And creatively,
it's opened him up.

23:52.735 --> 23:54.911
- He's working on a new album,
"Phoenix."

23:54.955 --> 23:57.479
- It's all about metamorphosis.
The healing.

23:57.523 --> 23:58.480
- Well, this may make you
feel better.

23:58.524 --> 23:59.525
We have a suspect.

23:59.568 --> 24:01.527
- Oh, word?

24:01.570 --> 24:02.876
Th-that's great.

24:02.919 --> 24:04.399
- What's his deal?
Did he confess?

24:04.443 --> 24:05.835
No, not yet, but...

24:05.879 --> 24:08.185
You're the only one
that's seen his face.

24:08.229 --> 24:11.014
- Nah, it was dark,
so I don't know if--

24:11.058 --> 24:12.842
- Yeah, and Dr. Freeman,

24:12.886 --> 24:15.192
that's Mathis'
psychiatric advocate,

24:15.236 --> 24:16.890
she doesn't want him triggered.

24:16.933 --> 24:18.718
- Don't worry about that.
There's a two-way mirror.

24:18.761 --> 24:21.155
You can see them,
they can't see you.

24:21.198 --> 24:23.940
We need you to step up.

24:23.984 --> 24:25.507
- Okay, yeah.

24:25.551 --> 24:28.467
Yeah, whatever you guys need,
I'm in.

24:28.510 --> 24:30.033
- Great.

24:37.998 --> 24:38.912
- Take your time.

24:44.091 --> 24:45.788
- Number... number three?

24:45.832 --> 24:48.225
- Are you saying
that it's number three?

24:48.269 --> 24:49.183
- Am I?

24:50.967 --> 24:53.317
Actually...

24:53.361 --> 24:54.797
It was number six.

24:58.540 --> 25:00.934
Wait, was it...was it three?

25:00.977 --> 25:03.414
- What is this, Counselor,
phone a friend?

25:03.458 --> 25:04.546
Just saying
what everyone's thinking.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.113
- Hold up, hold up.

25:06.156 --> 25:08.550
- You know what?
I know what's wrong.

25:08.594 --> 25:10.247
I turned,
and then I got a glimpse.

25:10.291 --> 25:11.292
- Okay.

25:11.335 --> 25:12.902
- So I was like this.

25:15.383 --> 25:16.950
Number two.

25:16.993 --> 25:18.604
No.

25:18.647 --> 25:20.301
Number four.
- Okay.

25:20.344 --> 25:22.085
- No further questions.

25:22.129 --> 25:24.653
- Well,
tomorrow is another day.

25:24.697 --> 25:27.047
- We're gonna go out this way.

25:28.483 --> 25:30.180
- Walk you out?

25:30.224 --> 25:31.181
How'd it go?

25:31.225 --> 25:32.269
- Not great.

25:32.313 --> 25:33.619
- Doesn't surprise me.

25:33.662 --> 25:36.709
Listen,
on the drive over here...

25:36.752 --> 25:38.972
he kept asking what number
the perp was gonna be.

25:41.191 --> 25:42.932
- The detective told me
that she'd never

25:42.976 --> 25:44.194
had a victim ask that before.

25:44.238 --> 25:45.544
- Okay, he was nervous.

25:45.587 --> 25:47.458
Cross-racial IDs
are always difficult.

25:47.502 --> 25:49.025
We caught Moran
with a stun gun.

25:49.069 --> 25:50.766
- But none of the other victims
have agreed to testify.

25:50.810 --> 25:52.812
That puts Mathis
front and center.

25:52.855 --> 25:54.378
Moran's got an alibi
for Friday night.

25:54.422 --> 25:56.293
He said he was at a Mets game
with his ex-girlfriend.

25:56.337 --> 25:57.860
- An ex-con's ex-girlfriend.

25:57.904 --> 25:59.340
I think you'll find a way
to deal with that.

25:59.383 --> 26:02.604
- Ms. Hadid, you warned me
that D'Angelo finds holes.

26:02.648 --> 26:04.998
- So fill them up
after the arraignment.

26:05.041 --> 26:06.565
The press knows
we have a suspect.

26:06.608 --> 26:08.654
This train's left the station.

26:10.438 --> 26:12.353
- Mr. Moran,
you're charged with four counts

26:12.396 --> 26:15.225
of aggravated sexual abuse
in the first degree.

26:15.269 --> 26:17.271
How do you plead?
- Not guilty, Your Honor.

26:17.314 --> 26:19.665
- Your Honor, Mr. Moran
arrested while on parole.

26:19.708 --> 26:21.623
It's a clear violation.

26:21.667 --> 26:23.494
- I'm sorry you didn't
learn your lesson.

26:23.538 --> 26:25.018
Remand to Rikers.

26:26.454 --> 26:27.847
- I'll get to you
as quickly as I can.

26:30.414 --> 26:32.025
Hey, Carisi.

26:32.068 --> 26:35.550
I always liked you as a cop,
so here's a tip.

26:35.594 --> 26:36.856
Your star witness is lying.

26:36.899 --> 26:38.466
I mean, demonstrably.

26:38.509 --> 26:39.598
- You should save that
for trial.

26:39.641 --> 26:41.208
- Oh, it'll come out
before then.

26:41.251 --> 26:44.515
Right now, I'm trying to decide
between CNN and Fox.

26:44.559 --> 26:45.604
You got a preference?

26:48.389 --> 26:50.217
- A bizarre twist today
in the alleged tasing

26:50.260 --> 26:53.133
and sexual assault
of pop superstar Mathis.

26:53.176 --> 26:55.222
Security footage has surfaced
of his brother Aygon

26:55.265 --> 26:57.180
purchasing a stun gun
from this store.

26:57.224 --> 27:00.836
- Dumbass used
his corporate credit card.

27:00.880 --> 27:02.664
- D'Angelo must've known
to go looking for his.

27:02.708 --> 27:04.013
Did somebody tip him off?

27:04.057 --> 27:05.667
- Moran told him
that he didn't do Mathis,

27:05.711 --> 27:07.016
and he would know.

27:07.060 --> 27:08.888
- Moran's alibi check out?

27:08.931 --> 27:11.194
- Yeah, his ex took a selfie
of them and their kids

27:11.238 --> 27:13.544
on the upper deck
at Citi Field.

27:13.588 --> 27:14.720
- It's already
all over Twitter.

27:14.763 --> 27:18.027
#MathisMadeItUp.

27:18.071 --> 27:20.682
- So even if Moran is good
for the other three assaults--

27:20.726 --> 27:22.379
- Which he is.

27:22.423 --> 27:24.120
- Mathis poisoned the well.

27:33.608 --> 27:33.782
.

27:33.826 --> 27:35.262
- Is this for real?

27:35.305 --> 27:36.611
- My brother buys a taser,

27:36.655 --> 27:38.004
and now y'all think
I made the whole thing up.

27:38.047 --> 27:39.135
- No one here is saying that.

27:39.179 --> 27:41.181
- It's all over the news.

27:41.224 --> 27:43.139
NYPD's trying to make me
look like a liar.

27:43.183 --> 27:44.750
- NYPD, or your brother?

27:44.793 --> 27:46.229
- He likes gadgets.

27:46.273 --> 27:47.666
He has a drone, too.

27:47.709 --> 27:49.580
- And tasers
are legal in New York State.

27:49.624 --> 27:51.582
- They are.

27:51.626 --> 27:54.673
Any idea where your brother was
during the time of your attack?

27:54.716 --> 27:56.022
- I'm not his keeper.

27:56.065 --> 27:57.676
- You show know
Moran has an alibi

27:57.719 --> 27:59.025
for the night
you were assaulted.

28:00.113 --> 28:01.375
- Okay, I see.

28:01.418 --> 28:02.942
So y'all pick up the wrong guy,

28:02.985 --> 28:04.508
and now you're trying
to make me carry the weight.

28:04.552 --> 28:05.727
- Okay,
let's go over your story

28:05.771 --> 28:07.033
and find out what we missed.

28:07.076 --> 28:08.774
- Maybe there's a copycat.

28:08.817 --> 28:10.993
Huh? Maybe there's two guys
out there.

28:11.037 --> 28:12.429
- Mathis, stop talking.

28:12.473 --> 28:14.083
We came here to cooperate.

28:14.127 --> 28:16.129
Is my client now a suspect
in any way?

28:16.172 --> 28:18.261
- That remains to be seen.

28:18.305 --> 28:19.698
- Then we're done.
- Whoa, whoa, listen.

28:19.741 --> 28:21.264
We're just trying
to get to the truth.

28:21.308 --> 28:23.397
- The truth is I was attacked!

28:26.966 --> 28:28.097
Come on.

28:29.185 --> 28:31.187
Brother,
you saw me in the hospital.

28:31.231 --> 28:34.234
The cuts, the burn.

28:34.277 --> 28:36.366
I'm telling y'all
this happened.

28:38.281 --> 28:41.154
What that guy took from me
I can never get back.

28:43.373 --> 28:45.332
Why in the hell would I make
something like that up?

28:48.074 --> 28:49.249
[knocking at door]

28:59.433 --> 29:00.782
- He really believes it now.

29:00.826 --> 29:02.436
- You mean he's doubling down.

29:02.479 --> 29:04.525
- You gotta give him credit
for that copycat theory.

29:04.568 --> 29:06.266
- I think it's more likely
that he's the one

29:06.309 --> 29:07.746
who copied the crime.

29:07.789 --> 29:08.921
He's heard about
these other assaults.

29:08.964 --> 29:10.270
He piggybacked.

29:10.313 --> 29:11.227
- So we grill him
until he admits it.

29:11.271 --> 29:12.881
- That's not gonna happen.

29:12.925 --> 29:14.840
- Can we at least agree
he didn't tase himself?

29:14.883 --> 29:17.625
- That's a good point.
So let's talk to Aygon.

29:17.668 --> 29:19.279
He bought the stun gun.
Ask him why.

29:25.764 --> 29:26.677
- Hey, Aygon.

29:29.289 --> 29:30.812
Hey, buddy.

29:30.856 --> 29:32.596
Hey.
Hey, hey.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.990
- Detective.
- Yeah, Rollins.

29:35.034 --> 29:36.470
Working some stuff out, huh?

29:36.513 --> 29:37.776
Must be stressful,
your face in the news

29:37.819 --> 29:38.994
like it is right now.

29:39.038 --> 29:40.430
- Well, tasers are legal
in New York,

29:40.474 --> 29:41.780
and I like gadgets.
I have a drone.

29:41.823 --> 29:43.042
- Right, I heard.

29:43.085 --> 29:44.347
It's just funny,
you buying a taser

29:44.391 --> 29:45.871
the same day
your brother's attacked.

29:45.914 --> 29:47.611
- It's for protection.
Mathis told me he heard

29:47.655 --> 29:49.613
about a guy attacking
some men at the studio.

29:49.657 --> 29:52.138
- Oh, so he knew about that
before he was attacked?

29:52.181 --> 29:55.097
- Probably from Twitter.
He's always on.

29:55.141 --> 29:56.925
- Oh, okay.
Well, another thing.

29:56.969 --> 29:58.840
Our lab found some fingerprints
on the bottle

29:58.884 --> 30:00.711
near the crime scene.

30:00.755 --> 30:03.062
Those gonna turn out
to be yours?

30:03.105 --> 30:04.454
- What's going on?

30:04.498 --> 30:06.979
Mathis told you
not to talk to anybody.

30:07.022 --> 30:08.154
- It's Vlad, right?

30:10.373 --> 30:11.635
Can I ask you some questions?

30:11.679 --> 30:12.636
- No.

30:16.510 --> 30:18.991
- Everybody thinks
Mathis is lying.

30:19.034 --> 30:20.557
But I know that kid.

30:20.601 --> 30:22.646
- Did you know he was gay?

30:22.690 --> 30:26.172
- Oh, okay,
that came as a bit of a shock.

30:26.215 --> 30:29.305
I knew his family.
They're church people.

30:29.349 --> 30:30.872
I think he was just ashamed.

30:30.916 --> 30:32.787
- But he was brave enough
to out himself

30:32.831 --> 30:34.484
and say he was the victim
of a crime.

30:34.528 --> 30:36.138
- Because of his integrity.

30:36.182 --> 30:40.316
- Only thing is, we don't think
that a crime took place.

30:40.360 --> 30:41.491
- You like Mathis, right?

30:41.535 --> 30:43.102
- I love him like a son.

30:43.145 --> 30:45.147
The DA wants
to come down on him hard.

30:45.191 --> 30:47.671
Now, do you think your client
is so desperate for attention

30:47.715 --> 30:49.282
that he would stage an attack?

30:49.325 --> 30:51.240
'Cause we can subpoena
your phone,

30:51.284 --> 30:52.807
your email,
your business records,

30:52.851 --> 30:54.635
and if we find out
you were complicit in this--

30:54.678 --> 30:57.203
- I didn't know.
I swear to God.

30:57.246 --> 30:59.248
I thought he'd really
been attacked.

30:59.292 --> 31:01.294
- Then you need to tell us
what you did know.

31:03.949 --> 31:06.125
- I didn't believe he was gay.

31:06.168 --> 31:10.869
But TMZ was threatening
to out him.

31:10.912 --> 31:12.000
- So he heard
about the assaults

31:12.044 --> 31:13.567
and he made a plan.

31:13.610 --> 31:15.874
- So why didn't TMZ
break the story anyway?

31:15.917 --> 31:19.790
- I threw them some dirt
on a former client.

31:19.834 --> 31:22.097
Crazy thing is, if you hadn't
found the actual guy,

31:22.141 --> 31:23.751
this would've worked.

31:27.015 --> 31:28.625
- Last week,
I was brutally assaulted

31:28.669 --> 31:31.019
in this neighborhood.

31:31.063 --> 31:32.586
When the NYPD asked me
to come forward

31:32.629 --> 31:34.544
at great personal cost,

31:34.588 --> 31:38.026
I did the right thing
for the greater good.

31:38.070 --> 31:40.333
What happens next?

31:40.376 --> 31:42.030
They call me a liar.

31:42.074 --> 31:43.945
[crowd booing]

31:47.775 --> 31:50.821
I'm heartsick
that the NYPD sees black men

31:50.865 --> 31:53.215
as criminals and not victims.

31:53.259 --> 31:54.869
[crowd booing]

31:54.913 --> 31:56.915
- What the hell
is this kid thinking?

31:56.958 --> 31:59.004
- He was gonna be outed.
He was getting in front of it.

31:59.047 --> 32:01.180
- He figured he could get
more sympathy as a victim.

32:01.223 --> 32:03.791
- Not from me.
I want him in cuffs.

32:03.834 --> 32:07.534
- But, Chief, our other
actual victims are afraid.

32:07.577 --> 32:10.058
So we go after Mathis,
then nobody comes forward.

32:10.102 --> 32:11.451
- It's too late for that.

32:11.494 --> 32:13.061
If your other victims
had been willing

32:13.105 --> 32:15.629
to testify in the first place,
we wouldn't be here.

32:15.672 --> 32:18.371
- Okay, Ms. Hadid,
you're new to SVU.

32:18.414 --> 32:20.590
We don't blame victims here.

32:20.634 --> 32:22.941
Human sexuality
and criminal behavior

32:22.984 --> 32:24.986
are a hell of a lot different
than securities fraud.

32:25.030 --> 32:26.945
- Thank you, Captain.

32:26.988 --> 32:28.424
What I do know,

32:28.468 --> 32:30.209
the longer this stays
in the news cycle,

32:30.252 --> 32:32.472
the longer we're standing here
with our junk in our hands.

32:32.515 --> 32:33.864
- Excuse me?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

32:33.908 --> 32:35.562
Egg on our faces?

32:35.605 --> 32:36.867
- Ms. Hadid, you're the one
who pushed Carisi

32:36.911 --> 32:37.694
in the first place.

32:37.738 --> 32:39.348
- Listen, all due respect,

32:39.392 --> 32:41.046
but this feels like
a circular firing squad.

32:41.089 --> 32:42.612
All Captain Benson is saying

32:42.656 --> 32:44.310
is that we have an obligation
to make this case,

32:44.353 --> 32:46.138
and Ms. Hadid
is just reminding us

32:46.181 --> 32:48.009
that the clock is ticking,
quickly and loudly.

32:48.053 --> 32:49.228
- The clock isn't ticking,
Counselor.

32:49.271 --> 32:50.577
It's blown up.

32:50.620 --> 32:52.448
D'Angelo's already
gotten a judge

32:52.492 --> 32:54.189
to drop the charges
on the Mathis assault.

32:54.233 --> 32:56.104
I don't see a path to
indictment on the other three.

32:56.148 --> 32:57.453
- It's there.

32:57.497 --> 32:59.238
We just need to keep
working the case.

32:59.281 --> 33:01.153
- I'll see
if I can get you 24 hours

33:01.196 --> 33:03.068
before the DA says
drop the case.

33:08.290 --> 33:12.033
- With all due respect, Chief,
she is not my boss.

33:12.077 --> 33:13.165
You are.
- I am.

33:13.208 --> 33:15.950
But she calls her boss,

33:15.994 --> 33:17.517
and he calls my boss,

33:17.560 --> 33:19.475
and the two of us are out
doing traffic stops

33:19.519 --> 33:21.695
in Staten Island with Dodds.

33:21.738 --> 33:25.264
- I don't care
about her exploding clock.

33:25.307 --> 33:27.048
So...

33:27.092 --> 33:30.138
talk to our other victims,
find more.

33:30.182 --> 33:32.053
I'm not letting this go.

33:42.063 --> 33:42.237
.

33:42.281 --> 33:44.152
- Ken tried to get
DeVonn Thompson to come in.

33:44.196 --> 33:46.024
No dice.
- And I'm 0 for 2.

33:46.067 --> 33:47.764
Marcus, Talbot, they won't
return my phone calls.

33:47.808 --> 33:50.898
- And we can't run the rape
kits without their permission.

33:50.941 --> 33:52.813
Any evidence
from the crime scene?

33:52.856 --> 33:55.381
- The only bottle
CSU found was Mathis',

33:55.424 --> 33:57.426
and that's just gonna end up
having his DNA

33:57.470 --> 33:58.471
and Aygon's prints on it.

33:58.514 --> 34:00.081
- Did you recheck
security cams?

34:00.125 --> 34:01.561
- Yeah, Moran
grew up there, though.

34:01.604 --> 34:04.042
He skirted the cams like a guy
staying dry in the rain.

34:05.391 --> 34:07.219
- Hadid gave us
till end of day.

34:07.262 --> 34:11.092
So go back to 9th Avenue,
see if any of the bartenders,

34:11.136 --> 34:14.530
any of the patrons can put
Moran with the other vics.

34:14.574 --> 34:17.185
- We can try, but after Mathis,
their walls are up.

34:17.229 --> 34:18.404
- Can you blame us?

34:21.059 --> 34:24.236
I came to you
because of Mathis.

34:24.279 --> 34:28.892
And now because of him,
even if I did testify...

34:28.936 --> 34:30.329
who would believe me?

34:35.508 --> 34:38.467
Ken said something I left out.
Could be helpful.

34:38.511 --> 34:40.948
- Talk to me.

34:40.991 --> 34:43.124
- You remember the first time
I told you I met Moran?

34:43.168 --> 34:45.213
I was outside the bar,
smoking.

34:46.780 --> 34:48.434
I left out a part.

34:52.177 --> 34:55.136
He followed me
back into the bar...

34:55.180 --> 34:56.572
then the bathroom.

34:58.661 --> 35:01.055
He got down on his knees...

35:01.099 --> 35:02.665
unzipped my pants.

35:02.709 --> 35:05.538
- Was that consensual?

35:05.581 --> 35:06.539
- Very.

35:07.844 --> 35:10.717
I know I'm repressed, but...

35:10.760 --> 35:14.808
once we started,
he really let go.

35:14.851 --> 35:16.331
- Then what happened?

35:20.944 --> 35:23.556
- I went back to the bar.

35:23.599 --> 35:25.384
I took a picture of us.

35:25.427 --> 35:29.953
It was like Jekyll and Hyde.
He just... snapped.

35:29.997 --> 35:32.391
I got out of there.
Fast.

35:32.434 --> 35:34.610
- Now, this wasn't the same
night he assaulted you.

35:34.654 --> 35:39.224
- No, I ran into him
at the bar a month later.

35:39.267 --> 35:41.574
I got out of there, but...

35:41.617 --> 35:42.705
he must've followed me.

35:48.537 --> 35:51.192
- That explains a lot,
but unless DeVonn testifies,

35:51.236 --> 35:52.759
that photo's inadmissible.

35:52.802 --> 35:54.891
- Let me call Carisi.

35:54.935 --> 35:58.634
Maybe there's a way that
this gives him some leverage.

36:03.552 --> 36:05.119
- Plea bargain?

36:05.163 --> 36:07.165
After your star client
has just been outed,

36:07.208 --> 36:08.557
pun intended,

36:08.601 --> 36:10.733
as the biggest liar
since Pinocchio?

36:10.777 --> 36:12.039
- Forget Mathis.

36:12.082 --> 36:14.998
- Well, I would,
but he's on every channel.

36:15.042 --> 36:17.087
And plus,
none of your other victims

36:17.131 --> 36:18.437
say they saw my client's face.

36:18.480 --> 36:20.613
- Actually, I have one
who did very clearly.

36:20.656 --> 36:25.139
In fact, I got some evidence
that you are entitled to see.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.662
- Exculpatory?

36:26.706 --> 36:27.707
- Yes and no.

36:30.971 --> 36:32.407
- What the hell is this?

36:32.451 --> 36:34.148
- That's a photo of your client

36:34.192 --> 36:35.889
with a man
that he later victimized,

36:35.932 --> 36:38.631
taken shortly after your client
dropped to his knees

36:38.674 --> 36:40.937
and expertly gave
this gentleman oral sex.

36:40.981 --> 36:42.156
- That's a lie.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.244
- In the downstairs bathroom
at Swank.

36:43.288 --> 36:44.463
You two look pretty cozy.

36:44.506 --> 36:46.247
- You son of a bitch.
Take that back.

36:46.291 --> 36:47.553
- Calm down, Jeff.

36:47.596 --> 36:50.643
Look, this photo
is probative of nothing.

36:50.686 --> 36:53.385
I mean, you just said
the interaction was consensual.

36:53.428 --> 36:54.560
- I did.

36:54.603 --> 36:56.301
And a jury
will be told that as well.

36:56.344 --> 36:57.737
They'll also hear the next time

36:57.780 --> 37:00.218
your client saw his lover,
he followed him,

37:00.261 --> 37:01.480
he demanded his phone,

37:01.523 --> 37:03.003
and then he sodomized him
in rage.

37:03.046 --> 37:05.745
- Is that right?
[chuckles]

37:05.788 --> 37:10.445
Try finding a juror
who hasn't heard about Mathis.

37:10.489 --> 37:11.925
Nobody's gonna believe
any of this.

37:11.968 --> 37:13.231
- That is fair enough.

37:13.274 --> 37:14.754
I just want to make sure
that your client knows

37:14.797 --> 37:16.408
what is gonna come out
in a public trial.

37:17.887 --> 37:18.801
Also...

37:20.629 --> 37:22.065
I mean...

37:22.109 --> 37:24.416
maybe the trial
doesn't go his way.

37:24.459 --> 37:26.287
It's a pretty difficult
backstory

37:26.331 --> 37:28.855
to carry into prison,
as I'm sure Mr. Moran knows.

37:28.898 --> 37:30.683
- I'm not gay.

37:30.726 --> 37:33.294
- He's bluffing.
You're not going away.

37:33.338 --> 37:36.819
- Maybe not, but, Mr. Moran,
here's your choice.

37:36.863 --> 37:38.952
Confess, and you go into prison

37:38.995 --> 37:42.216
as a straight man
who assaults gays.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.566
Or this goes to trial.

37:44.610 --> 37:48.962
And everybody hears that you're
a self-loathing homosexual

37:49.005 --> 37:52.095
who gets angry after he
services black men in bars.

37:53.662 --> 37:56.361
As your attorney
once said to me...

37:56.404 --> 37:58.101
what's your preference?

38:05.544 --> 38:06.719
- Chief.

38:06.762 --> 38:08.634
- I have good news,
and better news.

38:08.677 --> 38:11.506
I heard you about being
short-handed.

38:11.550 --> 38:12.899
I'm getting SVU a white shield.

38:12.942 --> 38:14.466
- A white shield?

38:14.509 --> 38:16.294
- You mean somebody
that's not a detective.

38:16.337 --> 38:18.208
- You'll both be great mentors.

38:18.252 --> 38:21.821
Also, Ms. Hadid just called
to thank me.

38:21.864 --> 38:23.649
Jeffrey Moran took a plea.

38:23.692 --> 38:25.564
He'll do seven years
for sexual abuse 1.

38:25.607 --> 38:28.393
- So nobody has to testify.
That is great news.

38:28.436 --> 38:30.438
- Any thoughts
on what changed his mind?

38:31.526 --> 38:33.093
- Um...

38:33.136 --> 38:36.096
It's kind of
a "don't ask, don't tell."

38:36.139 --> 38:38.098
- All right.

38:38.141 --> 38:40.361
I'll take the win.

38:40.405 --> 38:44.409
But next, we need to pursue
charges against Mathis.

38:44.452 --> 38:45.801
We have to send a message.

38:45.845 --> 38:47.325
- And what message is that?

38:49.109 --> 38:52.242
False reporting
is extremely rare.

38:52.286 --> 38:54.332
We keep this in the news,

38:54.375 --> 38:56.508
and survivors
are going to be afraid

38:56.551 --> 38:59.598
that they won't be believed.

38:59.641 --> 39:02.818
- So Mathis never pays
for the damage he's caused?

39:02.862 --> 39:04.603
- He's paying.

39:04.646 --> 39:05.908
Plenty.

39:11.131 --> 39:12.785
For what it's worth,
my Deputy Chief

39:12.828 --> 39:15.483
wanted to put you in jail,
but we talked him out of it.

39:17.485 --> 39:19.400
- What, I'm supposed
to thank you?

39:19.444 --> 39:21.228
I didn't make this up.

39:21.271 --> 39:24.100
- Look, I don't know why
you did what you did,

39:24.144 --> 39:27.277
but it's coming
from a bad place.

39:29.105 --> 39:32.631
- This where you tell me
that you're disappointed in me?

39:32.674 --> 39:33.980
That I screwed everything up?

39:34.023 --> 39:35.198
- Not everything.

39:35.242 --> 39:36.417
I was talking to my captain.

39:36.461 --> 39:37.984
If you hadn't
ever came forward,

39:38.027 --> 39:40.726
we would've never caught Moran.

39:40.769 --> 39:42.815
- That's true.

39:42.858 --> 39:44.425
Nobody remembers that.

39:44.469 --> 39:48.516
The whole world's
just laughing at me.

39:48.560 --> 39:50.779
- Not me.

39:50.823 --> 39:54.479
See, I know something
was done to you.

It ain't about this time.
It ain't about this thing.
