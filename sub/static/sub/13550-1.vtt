<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>It wasn't always like this.</i>

02:26.579 --> 02:28.809
<i>Before Paris,</i>
<i>people didn't drink our wine.</i>

02:28.882 --> 02:33.285
<i>I mean, my friends did, but you could</i>
<i>hardly consider their palates discerning.</i>

02:33.353 --> 02:35.548
<i>Hell, we were farmers, sort of.</i>

02:35.622 --> 02:38.785
<i>## [Rock]</i>

03:02.849 --> 03:06.114
<i>[Man] # When the sun comes up</i>
<i>on a sleepy little town #</i>

03:06.186 --> 03:09.314
<i># Down around San Antone #</i>

03:09.389 --> 03:13.018
<i># And the folks are risin'</i>
<i>for another day #</i>

03:13.092 --> 03:15.890
<i># Round about their homes ##</i>

03:19.866 --> 03:22.007
<i>[Man] I guess
I'm late.</i>

03:23.236 --> 03:26.399
I told him you were
under the weather.

03:26.472 --> 03:29.339
I don't think he bought that one.
[Chuckles]

03:32.412 --> 03:36.314
<i>Come on, Ken. You know I don't come</i>
<i>around here asking for money unless I need it.</i>

03:36.382 --> 03:40.318
- What's wrong with the old grape press?
- It's bruising the grapes.

03:40.386 --> 03:44.015
It's not about getting it done.
It's about getting it done right.

03:44.090 --> 03:46.786
It's about making the best
goddamn wine that we can.

03:46.859 --> 03:49.521
Jim...

03:49.596 --> 03:52.759
I have no interest
in taking your dream away.

03:52.832 --> 03:55.528
But maybe it's time
you look for a new one.

03:55.602 --> 03:58.298
You want me to sign every page?

04:01.107 --> 04:03.598
This is your third loan.

04:03.676 --> 04:06.668
<i>You default,</i>
<i>we take Château Montelena.</i>

[Man]
<i>Bonjour, madame.</i>

04:22.395 --> 04:25.831
You see, Maurice...

04:25.898 --> 04:29.356
just as Degas used paint...

04:29.435 --> 04:31.869
Rodin used bronze...

04:31.938 --> 04:33.872
Debussy, the piano...

04:33.940 --> 04:36.500
Baudelaire, language...

04:36.576 --> 04:41.536
so Henri Jayer and Philippe de Rothschild
used the grape.

04:41.614 --> 04:45.175
Great wine is great art, my friend.

04:45.251 --> 04:48.709
I am, in effect, a shepherd...

04:48.788 --> 04:51.188
whose mission is
to offer the public...

04:51.257 --> 04:53.191
another form of great art...

04:53.259 --> 04:55.557
and to guide...

04:55.628 --> 04:59.530
its appreciation... thereof.

04:59.599 --> 05:02.864
Well, a shepherd...

05:04.070 --> 05:07.506
by definition, needs a flock.

05:07.573 --> 05:10.872
<i>And a business, by necessity...</i>

05:12.145 --> 05:14.079
needs customers.

05:14.147 --> 05:19.244
So, if I were to subscribe
to that proviso...

05:19.319 --> 05:23.050
would you be considered a customer?

05:24.457 --> 05:27.051
No.

05:27.126 --> 05:29.060
No, I would be considered...

05:29.128 --> 05:33.690
an enthusiastic... advocate.

05:36.502 --> 05:38.436

05:44.110 --> 05:47.307

Oh, yeah.

07:55.174 --> 07:57.836
<i>And smoky. I-</i>

07:57.910 --> 08:02.108
I detect bacon fat...

08:02.181 --> 08:06.174
laced... with honey melon.

08:11.791 --> 08:13.918
Oh, yes.

08:13.993 --> 08:17.451
<i>And a fine, smooth finish.</i>

08:19.699 --> 08:23.533
- I'm gonna have to make some changes.
- What changes?

08:23.603 --> 08:27.369
I have to actually
sell some wines, for one.

08:27.440 --> 08:31.035
- Why?
- Because this is a business, Maurice!

08:31.110 --> 08:33.669
- Aha.
- "Aha" what?

08:33.746 --> 08:37.477
You've got it all mixed up.
You have <i>L'Académie du Vin...</i>

08:37.549 --> 08:41.008
<i>a school whose mandate,</i>
<i>unless I am somehow mistaken...</i>

08:41.087 --> 08:43.453
is to educate on wine.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.548
And what do you have
on your shelves?

08:45.625 --> 08:47.923
One Chianti and three Rieslings.

08:47.994 --> 08:50.326
The rest are all French.

08:50.396 --> 08:53.297
It might as well be
<i>L'Académie du Vin Française.</i>

08:53.366 --> 08:56.301
<i>But even if it was</i>
L'Académie du Vin Française...

08:56.369 --> 09:01.432
it should seek to present its subject
in a global context.

09:01.507 --> 09:04.067
<i>What about the rest</i>
<i>of the world, huh?</i>

09:04.143 --> 09:06.373
I just read an article
that said California...

09:06.445 --> 09:10.472
is gonna produce wine that will rival
the finest of the French.

09:10.550 --> 09:14.919
And when that happens,
I'm going home.

09:14.987 --> 09:17.512
No offense, but I don't foresee...

09:17.590 --> 09:22.027
the imminent cultivation
of the Chicago vine.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.288
I'm from Milwaukee.

09:28.534 --> 09:32.368
Oh, crap.
Mike, it's not clear.

09:32.438 --> 09:34.668
I was hoping for more.

09:34.740 --> 09:37.709
- <i>[Men Laughing, Chattering]</i>
- Shh, shh.

09:37.777 --> 09:41.679
Hey. We're racking the wine again.

09:41.747 --> 09:44.238
Dad, you gotta be kidding me.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.519
Outside. Now.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.852
No one in the valley racks
more than three times.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.823
- We do.
- [Groans]

09:52.892 --> 09:54.621
<i>Huh? Huh?</i>

09:54.694 --> 09:56.662
- <i>Oh, yeah?</i>
- Yeah.

09:56.729 --> 09:58.890
Whoa.

09:58.965 --> 10:01.126
We've racked the wine five times.

10:04.203 --> 10:07.570
- Come on. Aren't we fighting?
- [Grunting]

10:07.640 --> 10:10.200
Come on. Mike says we're gonna
rack it one more time.

10:10.276 --> 10:12.972
Huh? That chardonnay
has gotta be clear!

10:13.045 --> 10:15.673
Hell, we'll set
a world record then, huh?

<i>But you know what I discovered?</i>
<i>You really only need three, don't ya?</i>

11:02.695 --> 11:05.357

- So, you, uh-you okay?

11:21.547 --> 11:23.913
<i>Yeah, no, no. I-</i>

11:23.983 --> 11:27.544

- Hemingway, right?
- Yeah.

11:35.928 --> 11:41.662
Yeah, originally.
But, um, you'll hear my dad say it a lot.

11:44.603 --> 11:46.764
Come here. I just wanna
show you something.

11:46.839 --> 11:49.535
- Just take a second.
- <i>[Horn Honking]</i>

11:53.312 --> 11:57.772
So let's say you're strolling down the street.
Now, which business do you notice?

11:57.850 --> 12:00.717
Yours...

12:00.786 --> 12:03.084
<i>or mine?</i>

12:03.155 --> 12:07.091
Well, it depends if you're looking for
a bottle of wine or a limo tour of the city.

12:07.159 --> 12:09.093
Well, maybe so.

12:09.161 --> 12:12.927
But Pierre Tari seeks out
my business, not yours.

12:12.998 --> 12:15.899
Promotion, Stevie boy.

12:15.968 --> 12:18.664
That's the key to any
successful business venture.

12:18.738 --> 12:22.572
- Promotion.
- Pierre Tari?

12:22.641 --> 12:25.041
- Yes.
- Secretary general...

12:25.111 --> 12:28.376
of the <i>Association</i>
<i>des Grandes Crus Classés?</i>

12:28.447 --> 12:30.540
Yes again.

12:30.616 --> 12:34.177
Maurice, I have an idea.

12:34.253 --> 12:36.949
- You sure he's in there?
- Absolutely.

12:37.022 --> 12:39.183
Every Tuesday.
My guy, Yves Magnon, used to drive him.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.021
I see him.

12:53.339 --> 12:55.466
[Speaking French]

13:03.816 --> 13:06.148
Ah. Uh-

13:39.785 --> 13:43.221
No.

13:43.289 --> 13:45.223
Well?

13:45.291 --> 13:48.124
- Done.
- Wow.

13:48.194 --> 13:52.324
- He agreed, huh?
- He had a couple of stipulations.

13:52.398 --> 13:54.713
Like what?

13:54.714 --> 13:57.028
First, I have to come up
with 500 francs by Tuesday.

13:57.102 --> 13:59.036
You mean you have to pay him?

13:59.104 --> 14:02.596
I will be making a charitable contribution
to the federation.

14:02.675 --> 14:06.076
Ah. Hey, maybe it'll get you
a better table at their next dinner.

14:08.047 --> 14:10.413
- Blind tasting, huh?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

14:10.482 --> 14:12.416
<i>Sends out a message of impartiality.</i>

14:12.484 --> 14:15.453
<i>I don't think Tari and the other judges</i>
<i>need to see a label to tell the difference...</i>

14:15.521 --> 14:19.218
between a Mouton Rothschild
and a California twist-top red.

14:19.291 --> 14:21.418
If the French lose,
they might bring back the guillotine.

14:21.493 --> 14:25.725
Every great entrepreneurial
inspiration has its risks.

14:25.798 --> 14:28.232
What about publicity, huh?
Hey, I know this guy, George.

14:28.300 --> 14:31.326
He's a great writer.
He was even published in <i>TIME</i> magazine.

14:31.403 --> 14:34.065
Huh. The well-known wine journal.

14:34.139 --> 14:37.336
It's too American. Too up itself.
We need to involve the real news outlets.

14:37.409 --> 14:40.845
- You mean the French outlets.
- Maurice, this is a sophisticated story.

14:40.913 --> 14:43.006
It will lend itself
to sophisticated publications...

14:43.082 --> 14:45.107
that appeal to
a sophisticated readership.

14:45.184 --> 14:47.311
I'll call George.

14:50.322 --> 14:52.847
Wow. Would you look at that?
There must be over 500 words there.

14:52.925 --> 14:56.258
This article's all about
women's fashion accessories.

14:56.328 --> 14:59.456
Maurice, this doesn't
even credit George Taber.

14:59.531 --> 15:01.829
It's because George
is a ghostwriter.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.368
<i>And how do you substantiate</i>
<i>the work of a ghost?</i>

15:04.437 --> 15:07.895
- Has George ever written about wine?
- He's an oenophile.

15:07.973 --> 15:09.964
That'll be a no then.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.114
Complex and a bit woolly.

15:18.184 --> 15:21.620
I think it's a seducer.

15:21.687 --> 15:25.521
I'm going to California to try and find
some respectable competition.

15:25.591 --> 15:29.857
The wines will have to arrive a month
or so early so they'll have time to recover.

15:29.929 --> 15:33.387
- Are you saying that wine gets jet lag?
- [Laughs]

15:33.466 --> 15:36.663
No. It gets what is commonly
referred to as "bottle shock."

15:36.735 --> 15:39.636
Which might, of course, improve it.

15:40.906 --> 15:43.238
<i>[Glass Pings]</i>

15:45.878 --> 15:48.005

Old bank.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.845

<i>Yeah, you. Come on. Check my back.</i>
<i>Make sure it's clear, will ya?</i>

16:07.933 --> 16:09.662
Stop, stop.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.739
Oh, shit.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.776
Apologize.
You should have said "please."

16:17.843 --> 16:20.044
Let go of my antenna.

16:20.045 --> 16:22.246
You didn't say please because
you assume that I serve you.

16:22.314 --> 16:25.215
- If you put a crinkle in that-
- Because you are a racist.

16:25.284 --> 16:29.721
- Who do you think you are, Cesar Chavez?
- I am Gustavo Brambila!

[Gasps]

17:01.887 --> 17:04.219
[Groans]

17:07.126 --> 17:08.991
That was a good shot.

17:09.060 --> 17:12.394
Some solid force behind it. But let me give you
some advice. [Laughs]

17:12.464 --> 17:14.932
- Don't telegraph your moves, man.
- Do you do this often?

17:15.000 --> 17:18.299
- Change things up on me. Come on!
- No. Not really.

17:18.369 --> 17:22.271

Have you considered that you might
be swinging at the wrong dude?

17:32.551 --> 17:36.510
I mean, when you think about it,
it was Gustavo here who broke your antenna.

17:36.589 --> 17:40.150
Why are you swinging at Bo who was really
just trying to make sense of the situation?

17:40.225 --> 17:42.659
It's just- It's not logical to me.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.128
- She's right.
- Thank you.

17:45.197 --> 17:49.361

18:24.770 --> 18:29.707
<i>You didn't call. Having trouble</i>

Yeah.

- <i>My father was the original Joe.</i>

and good <i>terroir.</i>

18:52.297 --> 18:55.733
Well, dirt was good enough
for Al Lovering Tubbs in 1882...

18:55.801 --> 19:00.101
when he went and bought
253 acres of the stuff, right?

19:01.140 --> 19:03.074
- 254.
- That...

19:03.142 --> 19:07.044
and... yours was the
only position I was offered.

19:07.112 --> 19:11.606
Well, you know, history does judge
a prizefighter by the bouts he selects.

19:11.684 --> 19:15.211
And the ones he avoids.

19:15.287 --> 19:19.587

from a zinfandel.

21:05.764 --> 21:09.860
<i>All right. Ten bucks.</i>
<i>And he has to guess all three.</i>

21:09.935 --> 21:15.305
- Ten bucks. It's hardly worth the trouble.
- Okay. Twenty.

- Yes, well-
