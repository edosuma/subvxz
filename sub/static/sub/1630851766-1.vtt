01:03.105 --> 01:07.777
THIS IS A TRUE STORY

01:07.860 --> 01:09.904
[man on wireless]
The artist Louis Wain

01:09.987 --> 01:11.864
made the cat his own.

01:12.656 --> 01:14.825
He invented a cat style,

01:15.576 --> 01:17.661
a cat society,

01:17.745 --> 01:20.790
a whole cat world.

01:20.873 --> 01:24.460
Cats that do not look and live
like Louis Wain cats

01:24.543 --> 01:27.463
are ashamed of themselves.

01:27.546 --> 01:30.841
But that is not
what is important.

01:30.925 --> 01:34.303
What is important is that
Louis Wain devoted his life

01:34.386 --> 01:37.223
to making
all our lives happier,

01:38.098 --> 01:39.600
and cattier.

01:41.477 --> 01:46.774
In doing so, he undoubtedly
raised up the cat in society

01:46.857 --> 01:49.944
and he changed our world
for the better.

02:08.170 --> 02:11.090
[female narrator] Aside from
its bizarre social prejudices

02:11.173 --> 02:13.759
and the fact that everything
stank of shit,

02:13.843 --> 02:16.804
Victorian England was also
a land of innovation

02:16.887 --> 02:19.181
and scientific discovery.

02:19.265 --> 02:21.934
Many of the world’s
finest minds

02:22.017 --> 02:25.437
were digging deep
into the nature of electricity,

02:25.521 --> 02:28.357
to harness its power
for practical use.

02:32.736 --> 02:37.658
But for the young Louis Wain,
electricity was something else,

02:37.741 --> 02:40.661
something so extraordinary
and strange

02:40.744 --> 02:44.832
that the human mind was barely
able even to comprehend it.

02:44.915 --> 02:49.169
A mysterious, elemental force
that on occasion,

02:49.253 --> 02:52.131
he could feel
shimmering in the ether,

02:52.214 --> 02:55.259
and the key to all
of life’s most profound

02:55.342 --> 02:57.219
and alarming secrets.

ANDOVER
ANNUAL COUNTRY SHOW

03:53.984 --> 03:56.987
[train attendant] Please keep
your animals under control.

03:57.071 --> 03:59.365
Sorry. Uh, thank...
thank you.

04:06.205 --> 04:07.790
Thank you.

04:12.503 --> 04:15.089
Ooh. Are you an illustrator?

04:16.173 --> 04:18.592
Yes, I do illustrations
for money.

04:18.676 --> 04:21.345
I’m also working on several
patents at the moment.

04:23.305 --> 04:25.599
[chuckles]

04:25.683 --> 04:27.977
You’ve just come from
the country show, I take it?

04:28.060 --> 04:29.061
Mmm.

04:31.230 --> 04:34.483
You’re very muddy. Did you get
into a fight or something?

04:34.566 --> 04:37.277
Uh, no, I was attacked
by a one-and-a-half-ton bull.

04:37.361 --> 04:39.196
Oh. That was you, was it?

04:39.279 --> 04:41.323
Yes, I heard about that.

04:43.909 --> 04:47.037
How much would you charge
for a drawing of Cleopatra?

04:47.121 --> 04:49.331
Oh, I... I don’t really
draw people.

04:50.249 --> 04:52.209
Oh, no, sorry. Cleopatra.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.378
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
[laughs]

04:55.713 --> 04:58.716
Ah. Well, that
you can have for free.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.592
[gasps] That’s awfully kind.

05:00.676 --> 05:03.387
My sister usually takes her,
but she’s unwell,

05:03.470 --> 05:05.389
so it’s up to me today.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.391
Thought it might cheer her up.

05:08.434 --> 05:10.352
Dan Rider, by the way.

05:10.436 --> 05:11.437
Hello.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.900
Yes. Good.

05:21.697 --> 05:25.117
[man] Find his weak spot,
but just don’t show him yours.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.619
Move. Think.

05:28.746 --> 05:30.497
[laughter]

05:30.581 --> 05:32.583
All right, Wain,
that’s enough.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.585
You’ll be late for your
meetings, you daft apeth.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.754
Just allow me to have
one more crack at him, sir.

05:38.589 --> 05:41.175
The Bendigo Shuffle.
Come on. Here we are.

05:41.258 --> 05:43.677
Left to right, or right
to left. Ha, ha, ha, ha.

05:45.179 --> 05:47.806
I’m so sorry. Sorry.

05:47.890 --> 05:50.225
I received word
of your foolish antics

05:50.309 --> 05:51.935
at the country show.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.354
A whole raft of complaints

05:54.438 --> 05:56.482
about an odd fellow
being dangerous,

05:56.565 --> 06:00.027
climbing nonchalantly
into the Longhorn’s pen

06:00.110 --> 06:01.653
and standing not three yards

06:01.737 --> 06:03.572
from the largest
and most ferocious animal

06:03.655 --> 06:05.157
on the entire site.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.326
I wanted to get
a closer look at him,

06:07.409 --> 06:09.620
and, well, he didn’t have
a very good sense of humour,

06:09.703 --> 06:11.413
-put it that way.
-Thank you.

06:11.497 --> 06:13.082
Not renowned for their
sense of humour,

06:13.165 --> 06:15.959
-are they, really, bulls?
-Aren’t they?

06:16.043 --> 06:19.254
Every time I commission you
to illustrate a story for us,

06:19.338 --> 06:22.299
you manage to create
some kind of ridiculous chaos.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.929
Why were you throwing peanuts
at a bull?

06:27.012 --> 06:29.389
I heard they like peanuts
and that it calms them down,

06:29.473 --> 06:30.474
but it didn’t work.

06:31.683 --> 06:33.560
The trouble with these
show cows, huge egos.

06:33.644 --> 06:36.188
It’s a good job you can draw,
Mr Wain,

06:36.271 --> 06:38.774
or we would have parted ways
some time ago.

06:38.857 --> 06:40.317
And don’t think
I haven’t noticed

06:40.400 --> 06:42.194
the state of your visage.

06:42.277 --> 06:44.363
Oh, this wasn’t from the bull,
Sir William.

06:44.446 --> 06:47.574
I’ve just come from a boxing
class with the great Jem Mace.

06:49.326 --> 06:50.577
-Boxing?
-Mmm.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.872
So when did you draw this?

06:53.956 --> 06:55.999
On the train. From memory.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.335
-All of them?
-Mm-hmm.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.671
So, how fast
do you work exactly?

07:00.754 --> 07:04.007
Oh. I’ll just show you...

07:04.967 --> 07:05.968
Hmm.

07:06.051 --> 07:08.011
[hums]

07:09.012 --> 07:11.431
I’ll be frank with you,
Mr Wain.

07:11.515 --> 07:15.227
One of our speediest and most
prolific staff illustrators

07:15.310 --> 07:18.021
has been poached
by a rival publication.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.690
Do you think
you’d be up to it?

07:19.773 --> 07:21.650
Well, yes, obviously.
I mean...

07:21.733 --> 07:25.821
Well, I don’t find this work,
um, very taxing, Sir William.

07:25.904 --> 07:27.322
I do it to pay the bills

07:27.406 --> 07:28.866
and to provide
for the five hungry

07:28.949 --> 07:30.534
and precocious sisters
that I live with.

07:30.617 --> 07:31.952
Until they get married,
of course.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.163
As a matter of fact,

07:34.246 --> 07:36.415
I find the whole thing
rather inconvenient.

07:39.042 --> 07:41.378
I don’t think
you quite understand me.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.840
On the basis of the speed
and quality of your work,

07:44.923 --> 07:47.092
and with the proviso
that you can curb

07:47.176 --> 07:49.094
your more imbecilic
behaviour,

07:49.178 --> 07:52.347
I am offering you
a permanent position

07:52.431 --> 07:55.434
on the staff of the
Illustrated London News.

07:55.517 --> 07:57.186
That’s very kind of you,
but I can’t.

07:57.269 --> 07:59.313
I have several
electric patents to finish

07:59.396 --> 08:01.273
and, in fact,
I’m rather late

08:01.356 --> 08:04.610
for a meeting with Henry Wood,
the celebrated composer.

08:04.693 --> 08:07.112
-Henry Wood?
-I’ve written an opera.

08:07.196 --> 08:10.199
This is not an opera,
Mr Wain.

08:10.282 --> 08:13.285
By conventional standards,
it barely qualifies as music.

08:13.368 --> 08:16.622
And this is not a plot.

08:18.123 --> 08:21.043
It’s just
some of your thoughts.

08:21.126 --> 08:22.794
I applaud your enthusiasm,

08:22.878 --> 08:24.963
but you have to master
the basics of harmony first.

08:25.047 --> 08:27.132
I-- I’ve invented
my own harmonies.

08:27.216 --> 08:30.802
Yes, and that could be
part of the problem.

08:30.886 --> 08:32.387
If it’s any consolation,

08:32.471 --> 08:34.723
I thought the little drawing
you did on the cover sheet

08:34.806 --> 08:36.433
was rather charming.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.769
[Louis humming]

08:38.852 --> 08:42.606
[narrator] In the 18 months
since his father had died,

08:42.689 --> 08:45.817
Louis had nominally become
the head of the household.

08:46.985 --> 08:48.820
He was entirely unfit

08:48.904 --> 08:51.406
to shoulder these new
worldly responsibilities,

08:51.490 --> 08:55.202
but as the oldest and malest
of the six Wain siblings,

08:55.285 --> 08:58.497
it had unfortunately
become his duty.

08:58.580 --> 09:00.332
-[girl] Evening, Louis.
-Yes, good evening.

09:00.415 --> 09:01.792
-[girls] Evening!
-[woman] Louis!

09:01.875 --> 09:03.919
Yes, hello. How are you?

09:04.002 --> 09:06.964
-[woman 2] Ooh, are you back?
-Yes, I’m back, Josephine.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.715
Of course I’m back.
What do you mean?

09:08.799 --> 09:10.550
Louis, did you meet
an eligible

09:10.634 --> 09:12.594
young lady of means
in Hampshire?

09:12.678 --> 09:15.305
No, I did not, but I did meet
some goats, some geese

09:15.389 --> 09:16.765
and a rather
cantankerous bull.

09:16.848 --> 09:18.100
[Josephine] That’s no use.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.685
You can’t marry a goat,
can you?

09:19.768 --> 09:21.436
[narrator] Far better suited

09:21.520 --> 09:23.939
would have been his beloved
sister Caroline,

09:24.022 --> 09:26.441
who had become frustrated
by their rather whimsical

09:26.525 --> 09:28.151
and bohemian mother

09:28.235 --> 09:30.320
and stepped up at a young age

09:30.404 --> 09:32.781
to take charge
as the family’s matriarch.

09:32.864 --> 09:34.574
Have you been boxing again?

09:34.658 --> 09:36.618
[Louis] I told you, Caroline,
he barely charges me

09:36.702 --> 09:38.495
because I gave him
that drawing of Bendigo.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.039
Louis, will you practise
quadrilles with me after supper?

09:41.123 --> 09:43.083
Ah, you’ve come
to murder me at last.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.835
-Felicie, defend me, quick.
-En garde!

09:44.918 --> 09:47.337
Don’t! We have to talk
about finances.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.715
How was your meeting with
Sir William? Is he satisfied?

09:49.798 --> 09:51.591
Sir William is, if anything,
overly satisfied.

09:51.675 --> 09:53.760
He has offered me the position
of staff illustrator.

09:53.844 --> 09:55.721
Now, I really do need
to get to my room.

09:55.804 --> 09:59.224
[Josephine] Oh, my goodness!
Did you say staff illustrator?

09:59.308 --> 10:01.852
Yes, staff illustrator,
but I did not accept it.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.730
I beg your very pardon? Why?

10:04.813 --> 10:07.399
We already have twice as many
outgoings as you have wages

10:07.482 --> 10:10.068
and we’ve just hired
a governess.

10:10.152 --> 10:12.779
I told you to keep that room
for my secondary projects.

10:12.863 --> 10:15.115
Besides, I can teach them.
I’m perfectly qualified

10:15.198 --> 10:17.034
in all the relevant subjects.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.077
No, you can’t! You need
to be out there working!

10:19.161 --> 10:22.039
Quite right. You need to be
out there working, Louis.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.999
[Louis] Governess!
I’m afraid we do not require

10:24.082 --> 10:26.126
-your services at present.
-Louis!

10:26.209 --> 10:28.420
[Louis] Sorry for any
inconvenience.

10:28.503 --> 10:31.256
Governess? Governess?

10:31.340 --> 10:34.926
Do not go into
that woman’s room.

10:35.010 --> 10:36.136
Governess?

10:39.139 --> 10:40.557
Where are you?

10:40.640 --> 10:41.975
[Josephine]
Is she not in there?

10:42.059 --> 10:43.435
[Louis] Where... Where are you?

10:43.518 --> 10:45.145
[Caroline] Shh.

10:45.228 --> 10:47.522
Governess?
Is that you in there?

10:47.606 --> 10:49.441
Miss Richardson,
if you are in the wardrobe,

10:49.524 --> 10:50.859
we shall be most displeased.

10:50.942 --> 10:52.444
There’s no need
to be frightened,

10:52.527 --> 10:54.196
but I am going to
have to open the door.

10:54.279 --> 10:55.489
Oh, for fuck’s sake.

10:55.572 --> 10:57.074
[Louis] After a count of three.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.700
Three, two, one.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.290
Right, yes.
No, I can see how...

11:05.374 --> 11:07.751
I mean, as
first impressions go...

11:07.834 --> 11:09.169
How do you do, Mr Wain?

11:09.252 --> 11:11.004
Miss Richardson,
get out of the wardrobe.

11:11.088 --> 11:13.799
Yes, of course. Would you like
to know my name, Mr Wain?

11:13.882 --> 11:16.009
So you don’t have
to keep shouting "governess."

11:16.093 --> 11:18.470
I believe your mother’s napping.
Not very thoughtful, is it?

11:18.553 --> 11:20.472
Miss Richardson,
why were you in the wardrobe?

11:20.555 --> 11:24.017
It helps me to concentrate
to be in a confined space.

11:24.101 --> 11:26.478
And with Shakespeare,
I know it inside out already,

11:26.561 --> 11:28.814
so I block out the world
and play it through in my head.

11:28.897 --> 11:31.358
That’s all very nice, but the
thing is I was just saying,

11:31.441 --> 11:33.735
I am perfectly well versed
in mathematics and chemistry...

11:33.819 --> 11:35.529
You shan’t be needing
my services, then.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.364
-I’ll be on my way.
-No.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.366
Miss Richardson,
he’s just being an ass.

11:39.449 --> 11:41.284
I’m actually relieved
not to have to get up

11:41.368 --> 11:43.578
at 4:30 every morning
to prepare lessons.

11:43.662 --> 11:45.622
And I was a bit worried
about the ancient Greek.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.082
Homer’s use
of the metrical ictus

11:47.165 --> 11:48.417
does make it rather hard.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.001
All those feminine caesuras.

11:50.085 --> 11:51.795
I have no doubt
they’ll be much better off

11:51.878 --> 11:53.505
in your accomplished hands.

11:53.588 --> 11:56.633
I was just thinking,
I promised myself to submit

11:56.716 --> 11:58.927
my steady cycle patent
before the end of the month,

11:59.010 --> 12:00.971
if I’m teaching my sisters
the feminine senoras...

12:01.054 --> 12:02.472
-Caesuras.
-Exactly that.

12:02.556 --> 12:04.433
I won’t have time.

12:05.809 --> 12:07.018
So you’d like me to stay?

12:09.604 --> 12:11.523
My poor husband William
was thrown out

12:11.606 --> 12:13.567
by his family
in Staffordshire.

12:13.650 --> 12:16.319
-They were all Protestant.
-Leek.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.655
The town’s called Leek,
Miss Richardson.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.323
-Isn’t that funny?
-That’s hilarious.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.159
[northern accent]
They talk like this up there.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.994
[Mrs Wain] He wanted
to be a Catholic,

12:24.077 --> 12:26.455
but his father wouldn’t let him,
and so he just ran away.

12:26.538 --> 12:28.707
-He was a Cathoholic.
-Shush, Marie.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.750
-How did you meet him?
-I thought it was funny.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.127
Through the church.

12:32.210 --> 12:34.713
I designed tapestries
for the...

12:34.796 --> 12:37.340
Ooh. You’re getting heavy.
...for the church

12:37.424 --> 12:39.593
and he came from a silk family.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.303
He was a draper.

12:41.386 --> 12:43.805
And my own father...

12:43.889 --> 12:46.308
-I’m French, you see.
-[laughter]

12:46.391 --> 12:48.018
...smuggled himself to England

12:48.101 --> 12:49.769
by disguising himself
as a woman.

12:50.979 --> 12:52.689
We’re a family
of mischief-makers,

12:52.772 --> 12:53.940
Miss Richardson.

12:54.024 --> 12:56.693
We may as well have been called
the Shenanigans.

12:56.776 --> 13:00.071
You’ll have your hands full
with these three.

13:00.155 --> 13:02.574
And as for you two,
high time you found

13:02.657 --> 13:04.868
some nice husbands
of your own, don’t you think?

13:04.951 --> 13:06.661
[Caroline] We will, Mother,
in time.

13:06.745 --> 13:10.457
[Josephine] Well,
I was given quite the look

13:10.540 --> 13:13.460
from a hatted man
with a moustache on the bus.

13:13.543 --> 13:16.296
Absolutely enormous moustache

13:16.379 --> 13:18.590
and a very prominent brow.

13:18.673 --> 13:20.133
Yes, it was very prominent.

13:20.217 --> 13:22.552
It was like a dome.
But, um, it...

13:22.636 --> 13:25.472
Well, it was
quite the glance.

13:25.555 --> 13:27.015
It was embarrassing.

13:27.098 --> 13:30.393
-Did he seem wealthy, Josephine?
-Mother.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.229
[Felicie] Josephine’s
going to marry a man

13:32.312 --> 13:34.272
-with a big moustache.
-[laughter]

13:34.356 --> 13:36.483
[Marie] Caroline,
he might have a brother.

13:47.911 --> 13:49.829
[floorboards creak]

13:49.913 --> 13:52.332
[footsteps]

14:02.384 --> 14:03.593
[knocking]

14:17.190 --> 14:18.358
Miss Caroline.

14:18.441 --> 14:19.484
[giggles]

14:21.319 --> 14:24.114
Is everything to your
satisfaction, Miss Richardson?

14:24.197 --> 14:25.198
Very much so.

14:27.409 --> 14:28.702
Why do you ask?

14:28.785 --> 14:30.620
Oh, no.
Just, I was going to say,

14:30.704 --> 14:32.330
if the room
wasn’t to your liking,

14:32.414 --> 14:35.625
I would be perfectly happy
for you to swap with me.

14:35.709 --> 14:38.712
That won’t be necessary.
I’m very comfortable.

14:38.795 --> 14:43.842
Of course, but I wouldn’t
want you to feel... ill at ease.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.094
Sharing the floor...

14:48.263 --> 14:49.472
with a man.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.311
Why would that make me
feel ill at ease?

14:57.063 --> 14:58.565
Very well.

14:58.648 --> 15:01.026
Please keep
all of your belongings in order.

15:01.109 --> 15:03.069
You are here
as an example to my sisters.

15:03.153 --> 15:06.948
Of course. You’re very good
with them, by the way.

15:07.032 --> 15:09.826
It must be exhausting,
having to be the grown-up.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.579
Well, I am a grown-up,
so it’s not exhausting.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.420
Why are you holding a rock?

15:20.503 --> 15:22.130
I travel a lot,

15:22.213 --> 15:24.549
so I like to bring a few rocks
with me from Shrewsbury,

15:24.633 --> 15:26.968
where I grew up.
Helps me to feel at home.

15:27.052 --> 15:28.678
Why don’t you have this one?

15:38.605 --> 15:39.898
Sleep well...

15:41.608 --> 15:42.817
Miss Richardson.

15:54.496 --> 15:56.081
-Morning.
-Morning.

16:00.585 --> 16:03.463
[narrator] Louis had learnt
to control the chaos in his mind

16:03.546 --> 16:05.298
by always moving

16:05.382 --> 16:07.759
and for many years
had been quite content

16:07.842 --> 16:09.761
frantically pursuing
his various interests,

16:09.844 --> 16:13.098
as failed art teacher,
failed musician,

16:13.181 --> 16:16.601
aspiring inventor,
enthusiastic polyhobbyist,

16:16.685 --> 16:18.645
and, of course,
part-time illustrator.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.649
But the one thing
he had never considered,

16:22.732 --> 16:25.777
in spite of constant pressure to
find an eligible young spouse,

16:25.860 --> 16:27.612
was the possibility

16:27.696 --> 16:30.365
of ever leading
any kind of romantic life.

16:31.991 --> 16:35.995
And so, as a strange, tingly
feeling crackled in his breast

16:36.079 --> 16:38.123
and sparkled
through this loins,

16:38.206 --> 16:41.167
I think it would be fair to say
that the innocent Mr Wain

16:41.251 --> 16:43.837
didn’t really know
what the hell was going on.

16:47.048 --> 16:50.301
He had an inkling, of course.
But how could he be sure

16:50.385 --> 16:53.638
that these feelings
would be reciprocated?

16:53.722 --> 16:55.348
What of the unsightly harelip

16:55.432 --> 16:59.018
that he so sproutily disguised
with his careful moustache?

16:59.102 --> 17:00.645
Upon closer scrutiny,

17:00.729 --> 17:03.440
she would surely notice
this unfortunate deformity

17:03.523 --> 17:04.691
and run a mile.

17:06.401 --> 17:09.696
Or perhaps, she would not be
so impressed to discover

17:09.779 --> 17:12.657
that in spite
of the rather playful exterior,

17:12.741 --> 17:15.410
his mind was a dark,
screaming hurricane

17:15.493 --> 17:18.747
of crippling anxieties
and recurring nightmares.

17:22.876 --> 17:25.712
Not to mention, of course,
the gossiping neighbours

17:25.795 --> 17:28.715
who would all consider it
ghastly for a lowly governess

17:28.798 --> 17:32.552
to be engaging in these
bourgeois games of courtship.

17:32.635 --> 17:35.305
Emily Richardson’s slightly
unconventional attitude

17:35.388 --> 17:36.723
to her employer’s privacy

17:36.806 --> 17:38.349
had already caught the eye

17:38.433 --> 17:40.435
of nosy-posy Mrs Du Frayne,

17:40.518 --> 17:42.145
who was, by all accounts,

17:42.228 --> 17:45.398
the blabberiest mouth
this side of the River Thames.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.569
Suffice it to say,

17:49.652 --> 17:51.404
there were a great
many obstacles

17:51.488 --> 17:54.616
that stood in the way
of Louis and Emily.

17:54.699 --> 17:57.368
And in a different world,
he might well have decided

17:57.452 --> 18:00.413
not to disturb Sir William
Ingram’s daily splosh

18:00.497 --> 18:02.540
at the Turkish baths
in Islington.

18:02.624 --> 18:04.834
Ah. Good morning, Mr Wain.

18:04.918 --> 18:06.795
Good morning, Sir William.

18:06.878 --> 18:08.797
Don’t often see you in here.

18:10.048 --> 18:12.759
I’ve come to speak to you.

18:14.177 --> 18:17.305
-Have you got a moment?
-Yes, of course, Louis.

18:17.388 --> 18:19.682
Just let me finish
my morning exercises.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.184
Yes, of course.

18:27.565 --> 18:30.401
Actually, I might do some laps
myself now that I’m here.

18:32.278 --> 18:35.114
Careful! Careful, Louis.

18:41.663 --> 18:43.790
Oh! Louis?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.336
So you’ve come
to your senses, young man.

18:49.838 --> 18:51.881
Why the sudden
change of heart?

18:51.965 --> 18:56.135
Well, we’ve hired a governess
to teach my younger sisters.

18:56.219 --> 18:57.720
-A governess?
-Mmm.

18:57.804 --> 19:01.015
Ah, and you don’t want her
dashing off to some other family

19:01.099 --> 19:02.600
because you can’t pay her.

19:02.684 --> 19:04.561
[Louis] Something
like that, yes.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.688
Well, I’ll start you off
on poverty wages,

19:06.771 --> 19:10.483
as is standard,
but they will be regular.

19:10.567 --> 19:15.113
And I’m afraid we can’t pay you
for holidays

19:15.196 --> 19:17.031
or expenses at the moment.

19:17.115 --> 19:21.286
Will those terms be
to your satisfaction, Mr Wain?

19:22.328 --> 19:23.580
Good.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.874
[Emily and girls]
Tap, tap. Advance.

19:25.957 --> 19:27.375
-Advance.
-Tap, tap.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.168
-Tap, tap. Advance.
-Advance. Okay.

19:29.252 --> 19:30.503
En garde!

19:30.587 --> 19:32.171
-En garde!
-En garde!

19:32.255 --> 19:34.465
Caroline, can I show you
how I do fencing?

19:34.549 --> 19:36.217
Not right now.

19:36.301 --> 19:39.095
-En garde.
-Please be civilised, girls.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.472
[Emily] Mrs Wain, would you
accompany us on the piano?

19:41.556 --> 19:43.892
[Mrs Wain] I would love to
accompany you on the piano.

19:43.975 --> 19:46.227
[Emily] Let’s show them
what we’ve been practising.

19:46.311 --> 19:48.688
Every penny-counting rogue
in London knows that trick.

19:48.771 --> 19:51.149
-You’re not supposed to say yes.
-Did you not bargain with him?

19:51.232 --> 19:53.026
-Have I taught you nothing?
-I’m happy with it, Herb.

19:53.109 --> 19:54.819
Actually, I really ought
to be getting back.

19:54.903 --> 19:56.779
I have to start work
on my steady cycle patent.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.781
Forget that.
Nobody understands what it is.

19:58.865 --> 20:02.201
Don’t be such a fucking drip.
If you’re happy, you’re happy.

20:02.285 --> 20:05.246
I mean, you’ve been swindled,
so I don’t understand that.

20:05.330 --> 20:07.832
Let’s have some fun. I haven’t
seen you for three weeks.

20:07.916 --> 20:10.460
You’ve been spending too much
time with your weird sisters.

20:10.543 --> 20:13.129
You are staff illustrator
for the top newspaper in London.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.756
All you need now
is the loving touch

20:14.839 --> 20:16.549
of a well-bosomed
aristocrat.

20:16.633 --> 20:18.885
That’s the thing about
Phil May, the saucy fiend.

20:18.968 --> 20:21.971
Always hosting a skulk
of wealthy young vixens.

20:22.055 --> 20:24.682
We can’t celebrate
your success without you.

20:24.766 --> 20:26.684
There’ll be dancing
later, perhaps?

20:26.768 --> 20:29.103
There will be if you’re here,
I know that much.

20:30.271 --> 20:31.564
-I’m in.
-Come on.

21:24.867 --> 21:27.161
-Shh!
-[gasps]

21:29.288 --> 21:30.873
[whispers] Be quiet.

21:30.957 --> 21:33.501
[whispers] Oh. I was so quiet.

21:33.584 --> 21:35.378
Marie is having a nightmare.

21:35.461 --> 21:36.754
Oh.

21:38.381 --> 21:39.924
You’re drunk.

21:41.092 --> 21:44.178
Perhaps a little.
I’ve been celebrating.

21:45.513 --> 21:47.265
I accepted the job...

21:47.348 --> 21:48.975
with Sir William.

21:49.058 --> 21:50.059
Good.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.353
Now go to bed.

21:52.437 --> 21:54.522
[Marie] Caroline.
I can feel prickles.

21:54.605 --> 21:56.149
-It’s okay.
-I’m scared.

21:56.232 --> 21:59.277
-I’m here. I’m here.
-I’m scared, Caroline.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.779
[Caroline] It’s all right.
It’s just our silly brother

22:01.863 --> 22:03.990
trampling up the stairs.

22:04.073 --> 22:06.534
-Shh.
-[Louis mumbles]

22:06.617 --> 22:10.496
Try to think of a meadow
or a breeze.

22:10.580 --> 22:13.374
Keep calm, Marie, keep calm.

22:13.458 --> 22:14.959
Breathe.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.212
[Emily humming]

22:18.296 --> 22:19.922
Uh, good evening.

22:20.006 --> 22:22.133
-No.
-What?

22:22.216 --> 22:24.635
-Go away. Go away.
-Yes. What? Why?

22:24.719 --> 22:26.345
-What do you mean, why?
-I don’t...

22:26.429 --> 22:28.139
Yes, of course. Yes, sorry.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.267
What are you doing, Mr Wain?

22:31.350 --> 22:32.935
-I don’t understand.
-Get out!

22:33.019 --> 22:35.354
Right, yes, of course.
Sorry. I apologise.

22:35.438 --> 22:38.024
I am under your employ, Mr Wain,
but I do not expect

22:38.107 --> 22:40.276
to have to tolerate you
barging in here after hours

22:40.359 --> 22:42.236
while I’m...

22:42.320 --> 22:44.447
Well, it doesn’t matter
what I was doing, does it?

22:44.530 --> 22:46.032
[whispering]
Yes. Sorry. Of course.

22:46.115 --> 22:47.700
It’s just I have
so many sisters

22:47.784 --> 22:49.577
that sometimes I forget
that it’s...

22:49.660 --> 22:50.995
Were you painting something?

22:51.079 --> 22:52.830
That’s none of your business,
Mr Wain.

22:54.165 --> 22:56.292
But, yes, if you must know.

22:57.919 --> 23:00.463
I’ve got a drawing lesson
with the girls tomorrow,

23:00.546 --> 23:02.632
and all you Wains
are such accomplished artists

23:02.715 --> 23:05.259
that I rather thought I could do
with a bit of preparation.

23:05.343 --> 23:06.469
I see.

23:08.137 --> 23:10.139
Well, I was, um...

23:10.223 --> 23:12.517
Well, I just wanted to
invite you to the theatre.

23:12.600 --> 23:13.726
THE TEMPEST

23:13.810 --> 23:15.645
As an educational trip,

23:15.728 --> 23:17.772
with Felicie, Claire and Marie.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.692
I’m so sorry again, Miss
Richardson. I do apologise.

23:21.776 --> 23:23.486
I’m terribly embarrassed.

23:23.569 --> 23:26.114
It’s just I was excited
to share the idea with you

23:26.197 --> 23:28.658
and I just don’t want you to
think you have to be cooped up

23:28.741 --> 23:31.744
in this house all the time,
that’s all.

23:41.212 --> 23:43.464
I think it sounds
like a rather splendid idea.

23:46.551 --> 23:48.970
Please just knock the next time
that you wish to see me.

23:49.053 --> 23:50.179
Of course.

23:58.855 --> 24:00.815
-Is something funny, Mr Wain?
-Not at all.

24:01.816 --> 24:02.984
Not at all.

24:06.779 --> 24:07.822
Good night, Emily.

24:09.073 --> 24:10.283
Good night, Mr Wain.

24:17.665 --> 24:18.791
Miss Richardson?

24:22.128 --> 24:23.588
Yes?

24:23.671 --> 24:26.299
When it comes to drawing,

24:26.382 --> 24:28.968
there’s only really one rule
you ever need to teach.

24:30.761 --> 24:32.263
It’s to look.

25:11.219 --> 25:12.220
[sighs]

25:12.303 --> 25:13.971
[boy sobbing]

25:19.810 --> 25:22.438
Mummy! Daddy! Help me!

25:22.521 --> 25:24.899
I’m drowning! I’m drowning!

25:27.401 --> 25:29.028
[screams]

25:38.579 --> 25:40.414
[screaming]

25:46.796 --> 25:49.882
You’re so ugly! Ugly!

25:49.966 --> 25:52.802
You don’t belong here!
You don’t belong anywhere!

26:02.895 --> 26:05.064
[Felicie] It’s magic.

26:05.147 --> 26:07.441
What a clever bugger
Mr Newton was.

26:07.525 --> 26:09.485
[Emily] Uh, language,
please, Felicie.

26:09.568 --> 26:12.738
-[Felicie] A clever sausage?
-Sausage I will accept,

26:12.822 --> 26:14.782
although I fear
it rather fails to capture

26:14.865 --> 26:16.492
the spirit of Newton’s genius.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.619
[Marie] I’m a genius.

26:18.703 --> 26:21.247
If you work hard and continue
with your studies, Marie,

26:21.330 --> 26:23.374
perhaps one day, you will be.

26:23.457 --> 26:25.084
[girls] Thank you,
Miss Richardson.

26:25.167 --> 26:27.253
You’re very welcome.
Thank you.

26:27.336 --> 26:29.463
Quiet on the stairs,
please, girls.

26:30.840 --> 26:34.176
[Marie growls]
Crumpets, biscuits, cake!

26:49.525 --> 26:50.776
[knocking]

26:50.860 --> 26:52.028
Ooh. Come in.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.821
[door opens]

26:53.904 --> 26:55.197
[Louis] Good morning.

26:55.865 --> 26:56.949
Morning.

26:58.743 --> 27:00.202
How was your lesson?

27:01.078 --> 27:02.830
It was very good, thank you.

27:02.913 --> 27:05.374
Turns out that your sisters
don’t need my help with drawing,

27:05.458 --> 27:07.168
so we tried something
else instead.

27:07.251 --> 27:08.586
Good. That’s good.

27:12.173 --> 27:13.883
I hereby atone
for my drunken imposition

27:13.966 --> 27:15.718
by presenting myself
to you naked.

27:15.801 --> 27:17.887
Please don’t present yourself
to me naked, Mr Wain.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.972
I might consider that
to be a secondary imposition,

27:20.056 --> 27:21.474
arguably greater
than the first.

27:22.558 --> 27:24.977
But you cannot have failed
to observe

27:25.061 --> 27:27.563
that I have quite
a profound harelip.

27:28.939 --> 27:32.026
Yes. What of it, Mr Wain?

27:35.154 --> 27:36.697
Sorry. Have I made a mistake?

27:37.907 --> 27:39.450
No, I think you look
very handsome.

27:42.453 --> 27:43.704
So, uh...

27:44.705 --> 27:46.082
Well, am I forgiven?

27:47.208 --> 27:49.335
Why do you need me
to forgive you, Mr Wain?

27:57.051 --> 28:01.514
When do you think we might
make our trip to the theatre?

28:02.848 --> 28:06.268
For the, uh, for the education
of the girls, of course.

28:06.352 --> 28:07.395
Of course.

28:09.188 --> 28:11.607
Well, I’ll just consult
my diary.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.734
Excellent. Well, I shall
look forward to it.

28:16.362 --> 28:17.822
Thank you.

28:20.408 --> 28:22.159
I appreciate the gesture.

28:28.457 --> 28:31.001
[Caroline] But, Mother, we have
not yet settled our accounts

28:31.085 --> 28:32.628
with the coal merchant
and the butcher.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.046
He should have
consulted me first.

28:34.130 --> 28:35.673
Boring. [blows raspberry]

28:35.756 --> 28:38.134
We cannot let him out
looking like this.

28:38.217 --> 28:40.970
Why you’ve committed
this most wanton

28:41.053 --> 28:44.265
and violent act of self-harm,
I do not know.

28:44.348 --> 28:46.392
How will he ever
meet a woman of fortune?

28:46.475 --> 28:49.437
Caroline, he’s had a shave,
that’s all.

28:49.520 --> 28:52.106
Marie, darling,
where have you gone?

28:52.189 --> 28:54.275
[Josephine] Well, I think
we should all go.

28:54.358 --> 28:55.943
Make an evening of it.

28:56.026 --> 28:57.736
[Caroline] Josephine,
we at least must stay.

28:57.820 --> 28:59.947
-Marie?
-[Marie whimpers]

29:01.240 --> 29:02.450
[Marie] Don’t come in.

29:03.409 --> 29:05.244
[Emily] Marie, what’s happened?

29:05.327 --> 29:06.829
[Marie sobs]

29:10.833 --> 29:13.377
Oh, it’s all right.

29:13.461 --> 29:16.839
It’s all right.
It’s perfectly natural.

29:19.800 --> 29:23.762
If anything, it’s a good thing.
It means you’re a woman.

29:23.846 --> 29:27.266
Well, I should like to go
not so much for the play

29:27.349 --> 29:29.602
but for the handsome
young bachelors in the crowd.

29:29.685 --> 29:31.145
We can practise
our flirtations.

29:31.228 --> 29:33.355
I should like to go
because I should like to go.

29:33.439 --> 29:34.982
If you change your mind,
Caroline,

29:35.065 --> 29:36.650
you’re more than welcome
to join us.

29:36.734 --> 29:38.527
I think it fair to say
that Miss Richardson

29:38.611 --> 29:40.279
has had a positive effect
on this family

29:40.362 --> 29:41.697
and we should show
our gratitude.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.157
I’m a woman!

29:43.240 --> 29:44.575
[Josephine] Hurray!

29:45.784 --> 29:47.369
Sorry, everyone.
Bit of a situation,

29:47.453 --> 29:49.622
but everything’s under control.

29:54.668 --> 29:55.794
Oh.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.480
That’s the governess
I was telling you about.

30:14.563 --> 30:17.233
-Oh.
-For the Wains.

30:17.316 --> 30:20.653
-Uh, you look very...
-No, thank you. So do you.

30:20.736 --> 30:22.321
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Shall we...

30:22.404 --> 30:25.574
-Yes, let’s...
-Yes, let’s sit down. Good.

30:26.700 --> 30:28.452
Is this...
Is this your first time?

30:28.536 --> 30:30.329
-Yes, it is, it is.
-Okay.

30:30.412 --> 30:33.332
-It’s exciting.
-Good.

30:35.668 --> 30:36.669
Ooh.

30:37.545 --> 30:39.797
-Here.
-Thank you.

30:43.592 --> 30:46.303
-[howling wind, thudding]
-[crunching]

30:49.431 --> 30:51.350
[man] Boatswain!

30:52.726 --> 30:55.479
[boatswain] Here, master!
What cheer?

30:55.563 --> 30:58.357
[master] Good, speak
to the mariners.

30:58.440 --> 31:02.820
Fall to’t, yarely,
or we run ourselves aground:

31:02.903 --> 31:06.740
bestir, bestir.

31:08.826 --> 31:10.869
[boatswain] Heigh, my hearts!

31:10.953 --> 31:14.456
Cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!

31:14.540 --> 31:16.166
Yare, yare!

31:16.250 --> 31:17.501
Take in the topsail.

31:17.585 --> 31:19.545
[mariners] Topsail!

31:19.628 --> 31:21.880
[boatswain]
Tend to the master’s whistle.

31:23.090 --> 31:25.342
[young Louis]
Mummy! Daddy! Help me!

31:25.426 --> 31:28.721
I’m drowning! I’m drowning!

31:28.804 --> 31:32.766
Help me! I’m drowning!
Please!

31:32.850 --> 31:35.519
Help me! I’m drowning!

31:44.361 --> 31:47.990
Um... this is the
gentlemen’s toilet.

31:48.073 --> 31:49.742
Yes. Sorry.

31:51.243 --> 31:52.244
I...

31:53.996 --> 31:58.000
I was worried that you might be
distressed about something.

31:58.083 --> 32:00.878
No, no. Just a funny turn,
that’s all.

32:01.670 --> 32:03.047
Right, yes.

32:03.130 --> 32:06.383
No, I thought
it might have, um,

32:06.467 --> 32:08.469
might have reminded you
of something.

32:12.348 --> 32:15.684
Something you found frightening
as a child, perhaps,

32:15.768 --> 32:17.478
like a recurring nightmare.

32:17.561 --> 32:20.689
Like "The Sea
Full Of Big Ships."

32:20.773 --> 32:24.401
I might have accidentally
looked in your journal.

32:26.362 --> 32:27.946
Well, that... that was nosy.

32:28.030 --> 32:29.531
I’m afraid it’s one
of my many flaws.

32:29.615 --> 32:31.784
-Nosiness?
-I’m very nosy, yes.

32:31.867 --> 32:34.370
It’s partly why I chose
to become a governess.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.538
Did you find it horrifying?

32:36.622 --> 32:40.125
All those dark
and disturbing visions?

32:40.209 --> 32:44.046
No. I found it quite reassuring,
to be honest.

32:45.756 --> 32:47.508
I tend to have nightmares about

32:47.591 --> 32:49.760
not being able
to get out of places.

32:49.843 --> 32:51.428
I once spent an entire dream

32:51.512 --> 32:53.013
stuck in a
very complicated barn.

32:54.556 --> 32:56.850
Well, thank God you didn’t
get stuck in that wardrobe.

32:57.893 --> 32:59.019
Yeah, thank God.

33:03.148 --> 33:05.275
Thank God I had you
to let me out of it.

33:17.246 --> 33:18.414
[toilet flushes]

33:20.165 --> 33:21.208
[door opens]

33:26.130 --> 33:28.215
[turns tap, water runs]

33:47.901 --> 33:49.111
[turns tap]

33:58.912 --> 34:00.289
Good God!

34:00.372 --> 34:02.291
It definitely did happen
in the toilet.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.127
-[Marie] Oh, hello.
-[Felicie] Hello.

34:05.210 --> 34:07.546
Well, if it isn’t
my favourite family,

34:07.629 --> 34:10.716
the Wains. Hello, girls.
How are you, Louis?

34:10.799 --> 34:14.261
Very well, thank you,
Mrs Du Frayne. Um, how are you?

34:14.344 --> 34:17.765
Quite well. Terrific eulogy
at your father’s funeral.

34:17.848 --> 34:20.267
Thank you. You say that
every time I see you.

34:20.350 --> 34:23.312
And you must be
the famous Emily Richardson.

34:23.395 --> 34:25.522
-Nice to meet you.
-We were just remarking

34:25.606 --> 34:27.816
that we don’t often see
governesses at the theatre.

34:27.900 --> 34:29.485
Was it your first time?

34:30.652 --> 34:33.405
I hear you got a little
bit confused...

34:34.406 --> 34:36.575
about the lavatories.

34:36.658 --> 34:38.285
[all laugh]

34:38.368 --> 34:39.828
[forced laugh]

34:42.706 --> 34:44.541
Yes, confused.

34:45.709 --> 34:47.127
Quite charming.

34:58.806 --> 35:01.058
[Caroline] You are clearly
an intelligent woman,

35:01.141 --> 35:02.935
Miss Richardson,

35:03.018 --> 35:05.938
and we’ve been impressed
by your teaching.

35:06.021 --> 35:08.857
But there are certain aspects
of your behaviour,

35:10.108 --> 35:12.110
and certain aspects

35:12.194 --> 35:14.196
of the behaviour
that you encourage

35:14.279 --> 35:16.365
in my ridiculous brother

35:18.033 --> 35:21.870
that we simply cannot tolerate.

35:21.954 --> 35:24.748
This evening was intended
to be an educational event.

35:24.832 --> 35:26.667
Yet now, thanks to you,

35:26.750 --> 35:28.710
this family
is the talk of the town.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.295
And not in a good way.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.968
You have three days
to get your affairs in order.

35:49.398 --> 35:50.774
[door opens]

35:55.112 --> 35:57.197
I just wanted to thank you,
Mr Wain,

35:58.740 --> 36:00.576
for a very pleasant evening.

36:00.659 --> 36:02.160
I had a very nice time.

36:05.956 --> 36:07.624
I’ve taught
of countless adventures

36:07.708 --> 36:09.459
from the safety
of a schoolroom.

36:11.336 --> 36:15.674
But it was exciting
to be taken on one for once.

36:28.979 --> 36:31.231
I... I like your shawl,
by the way.

36:33.483 --> 36:35.861
Thank you. It was my mother’s.

36:39.823 --> 36:41.033
It’s blue.

36:43.076 --> 36:45.162
Yep. It’s blue.

36:52.252 --> 36:53.545
Goodbye, Louis.

37:09.561 --> 37:12.397
I don’t care, I don’t care,
I don’t care what people think.

37:19.988 --> 37:21.156
Nor do I.

37:23.492 --> 37:24.993
-Mmm! Close the door.
-What?

37:25.077 --> 37:27.788
Close the door. Ooh. Ooh.

37:27.871 --> 37:29.539
[giggles]

37:29.623 --> 37:31.500
-[Louis] What happened?
-I fell over my dress.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.168
-[Louis] I’m sorry.
-It’s not your fault.

37:33.251 --> 37:34.461
Sit down.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.926
[narrator]
As this peculiar romance

37:41.009 --> 37:43.011
blossomed clumsily into flower,

37:43.095 --> 37:45.055
the discrepancy
in their social standing

37:45.138 --> 37:47.683
became the cause
of great controversy.

37:47.766 --> 37:50.268
One neighbour,
it was widely rumoured,

37:50.352 --> 37:54.106
vomited immediately upon
hearing news of their courtship.

37:54.189 --> 37:57.442
For the coupling of a gentleman
with a lady of the servile class

37:57.526 --> 37:59.861
was considered
nothing short of revolting.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.655
Not to mention

38:01.738 --> 38:03.991
that the undeniably
charming Miss Richardson

38:04.074 --> 38:06.618
was, by the standards
of the day,

38:06.702 --> 38:08.745
positively geriatric.

38:13.667 --> 38:16.920
But Louis cared little for
these foolish preconceptions,

38:17.004 --> 38:20.132
and in January
of the year 1884,

38:20.215 --> 38:23.135
he asked Emily
for her hand in marriage.

38:26.596 --> 38:30.684
1884

38:33.270 --> 38:35.188
Trim the bottom.
Trim the bottom.

38:46.033 --> 38:48.577
-[coughs] It’s dusty.
-It’s a bit dusty.

38:48.660 --> 38:52.789
MRS W WAIN
ONE POUND, TEN SHILLINGS

38:56.126 --> 38:58.295
[narrator] The weeks
turned to months,

38:58.378 --> 39:00.505
and in spite of the newly
fractious relationship

39:00.589 --> 39:02.299
with his sisters,

39:02.382 --> 39:04.217
Louis quietly continued
in his endeavours

39:04.301 --> 39:05.927
to support them.

39:06.011 --> 39:08.263
Every week, he would
post a modest cheque

39:08.346 --> 39:09.765
to his dear mother,

39:09.848 --> 39:12.184
and even began to take on
private commissions

39:12.267 --> 39:14.144
as a dog portraitist,

39:14.227 --> 39:17.397
visiting dukes and duchesses,
lords and ladies,

39:17.481 --> 39:20.192
and their pampered
canine friends.

39:20.275 --> 39:23.987
At the same time,
he continued with his work

39:24.071 --> 39:27.032
covering general news
and various agricultural shows

39:27.115 --> 39:28.784
for Sir William.

39:28.867 --> 39:32.162
And thus for six
precious months,

39:32.245 --> 39:35.332
Louis and Emily
lived a perfectly normal,

39:35.415 --> 39:39.044
if societally unconscionable
married life.

40:05.862 --> 40:08.824
I gather you’re an
educated woman, Mrs Wain.

40:10.659 --> 40:12.786
Yes, Doctor.
I was a governess.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.915
I... I see.

40:17.666 --> 40:19.167
Well, in that case,

40:19.251 --> 40:21.253
I trust you will
understand me when I say...

40:23.004 --> 40:25.006
you have terminal
cancer of the breast.

40:30.595 --> 40:31.805
Yes, Doctor.

40:40.856 --> 40:42.065
[sighs]

40:48.905 --> 40:50.991
Just when I was starting
to enjoy it.

41:03.753 --> 41:05.380
[kitten meows]

41:05.463 --> 41:06.756
What was that?

41:07.340 --> 41:08.675
Strange.

41:08.758 --> 41:10.260
[meowing]

41:15.223 --> 41:16.725
[meowing continues]

41:18.435 --> 41:20.020
[thunder rumbles]

41:20.103 --> 41:21.479
[meowing continues]

41:23.481 --> 41:25.400
Oh, Louis, look.

41:26.776 --> 41:28.320
Hello there, little thing.

41:29.905 --> 41:32.073
-Hello.
-Hello there, cat.

41:32.157 --> 41:37.078
[Emily] You’re soaking wet.
You poor little thing.

41:37.162 --> 41:39.623
Why don’t you
come in the warm with us?

41:39.706 --> 41:42.042
Yeah? Hello.

41:42.125 --> 41:44.419
We’ll take care of you.
Won’t we, Louis?

41:45.128 --> 41:47.005
Yes, we will.

41:47.088 --> 41:50.050
Hello. Hello.

41:50.759 --> 41:52.093
Ooh.

41:52.177 --> 41:53.303
[meows]

41:55.096 --> 41:58.058
[Emily] It’s all right.
It’s all right.

41:59.184 --> 42:01.770
Rain. It’s just raining.

42:06.900 --> 42:08.318
[thunder rumbles]

42:12.239 --> 42:14.115
-[Emily] Who’s that?
-[meows]

42:14.199 --> 42:15.367
It’s Louis.

42:16.701 --> 42:18.620
Got another
little towel for you.

42:20.413 --> 42:23.041
-That’s better, isn’t it?
-See?

42:23.124 --> 42:24.334
That’s better.

42:26.002 --> 42:28.171
-That’s better.
-[meows]

42:28.255 --> 42:30.465
-Hello.
-Hello.

42:30.548 --> 42:32.175
-Hello.
-Hello.

42:33.760 --> 42:34.970
[laughs]

42:35.053 --> 42:36.513
Hello.

42:36.596 --> 42:38.348
Where do you think
you’re going?

42:39.683 --> 42:41.851
What would you like
to be called?

42:41.935 --> 42:43.520
[Louis] Percy?

42:43.603 --> 42:46.106
-I quite like Percy.
-Paul?

42:46.189 --> 42:47.482
Not Paul.

42:48.275 --> 42:49.359
Peter?

42:49.901 --> 42:50.944
Peter.

42:52.112 --> 42:53.530
-Peter.
-Peter.

42:58.326 --> 43:00.203
[laughter]

43:07.627 --> 43:10.964
[man] It’s sure to be a quick
kerfuffle when Bendigo’s here

43:11.047 --> 43:13.216
with the Bendigo Shuffle!

43:15.051 --> 43:16.386
Curious little fellow,
isn’t he?

43:16.469 --> 43:17.929
Yes, but he’s electric, Herb.

43:18.013 --> 43:20.265
Look how his fancy
all adore him.

43:20.348 --> 43:21.725
Half his opponent’s size,

43:21.808 --> 43:25.103
yet he knows how to harness
the electricity of the crowd.

43:25.186 --> 43:27.022
Are you talking
about the photographers?

43:27.105 --> 43:30.275
Look properly, Herb.
The electricity.

43:30.358 --> 43:32.110
Finally, I’m starting
to understand it.

43:32.193 --> 43:34.821
[Herb] Is everything
all right at home?

43:34.904 --> 43:37.574
-With Emily, I mean?
-Oh, yes, of course.

43:37.657 --> 43:39.534
We have a new friend.
He’s called Peter.

43:39.617 --> 43:42.078
-Peter?
-He’s a cat. We have a cat now.

43:42.162 --> 43:44.873
-For mousing, you mean?
-No, Herb, as a pet.

43:44.956 --> 43:46.624
Okay, Louis,
I’m worried about you.

43:46.708 --> 43:49.836
-Why?
-You have a cat as a pet.

43:51.171 --> 43:52.922
Do you know the true meaning
of the phrase,

43:53.006 --> 43:56.092
"There’s no time
like the present," Herb?

43:56.176 --> 43:59.179
It’s that there isn’t.
It’s too fleeting.

43:59.262 --> 44:01.181
In fact, I have a hypothesis

44:01.264 --> 44:03.308
that electricity is what
pushes us through time.

44:03.391 --> 44:05.352
We turn the past
into the future

44:05.435 --> 44:07.437
with the power
of our electricity.

44:07.520 --> 44:09.856
But that process
is entirely reversible.

44:09.939 --> 44:12.108
Remembering the past
is no different

44:12.192 --> 44:13.693
from imagining the future.

44:13.777 --> 44:16.363
And neither is different
to life itself.

44:16.446 --> 44:18.573
I can remember Emily
in the future

44:18.656 --> 44:20.116
and she will be there.

44:21.201 --> 44:23.036
Do you see
what I’m saying, Herb?

44:24.537 --> 44:26.373
Do you see what I’m saying?

44:27.916 --> 44:29.542
[cheering]

44:33.254 --> 44:38.051
[crowd] Bendigo! Bendigo!
Bendigo! Bendigo!

44:38.134 --> 44:42.347
Bendigo! Bendigo! Bendigo!

44:42.430 --> 44:44.641
[Louis] But these don’t capture
the spirit of the fight,

44:44.724 --> 44:45.975
Sir William.

44:46.059 --> 44:48.186
[Sir William] Yes, they do.

44:48.269 --> 44:50.688
That’s why they’re in vogue.

44:50.772 --> 44:55.318
They’re fast, they’re cheap
and they’re 100% accurate.

44:55.402 --> 44:57.237
But where is the electricity?

45:02.575 --> 45:05.954
Louis, I hear your wife
is very sick.

45:07.414 --> 45:11.167
I know that you continue to
support your mother and sisters,

45:11.251 --> 45:13.586
which is admirable, Louis,
so I’m...

45:13.670 --> 45:15.797
I’m sorry
to have to say this.

45:15.880 --> 45:17.799
But it may be
that I cannot use you

45:17.882 --> 45:20.510
quite as much as I would like
for the time being.

45:20.593 --> 45:22.679
I have to get
our finances in order,

45:22.762 --> 45:26.474
and that means making
difficult, practical decisions.

45:26.558 --> 45:30.562
But my advice to you is this:

45:32.063 --> 45:35.442
Spend the time that you gain
with your wife,

45:36.401 --> 45:38.611
because when she is gone...

45:44.617 --> 45:45.910
it will hurt.

45:51.374 --> 45:53.126
These are precious weeks,
Louis.

45:54.669 --> 45:56.004
Do you understand?

46:20.778 --> 46:22.780
-[Louis] Come on, Peter.
-[Emily] Come on, Peter.

46:22.864 --> 46:24.824
[Emily] Up the stairs.
Come on.

46:24.908 --> 46:26.659
-[Louis] I think he’s coming.
-[Emily] Peter.

46:26.743 --> 46:28.453
-Peter?
-[gasps]

46:29.287 --> 46:31.080
[Emily] Good boy.

46:31.956 --> 46:33.500
Good boy.

46:35.293 --> 46:36.836
Good boy.

46:38.796 --> 46:40.340
Well done, Peter.

46:40.423 --> 46:42.800
-Well done, Peter.
-Well done.

47:10.370 --> 47:13.164
Let’s go for a walk. Yes.

47:17.335 --> 47:18.503
[meows]

47:23.800 --> 47:25.552
-After you.
-Thank you.

47:32.892 --> 47:35.645
[Louis] I think
Peter likes the oak trees.

47:35.728 --> 47:37.438
[Emily] Mm-hmm.

47:37.522 --> 47:40.900
-They’re amazing, aren’t they?
-[Louis] Mmm.

47:40.984 --> 47:43.194
They live for a thousand years.

47:44.654 --> 47:46.155
Three hundred years to grow.

47:47.031 --> 47:48.616
Three hundred years to live.

47:49.450 --> 47:51.160
Three hundred years to die.

47:53.496 --> 47:55.248
-[Louis] Oh, that’ll do.
-[laughs]

47:55.331 --> 47:58.334
[Louis] It looks lovely.
Peter likes it now.

47:59.294 --> 48:01.796
-Don’t you, Peter?
-[meows]

48:24.777 --> 48:26.279
[Louis] Electricity.

48:28.197 --> 48:30.658
I feel electricity.

48:33.494 --> 48:34.829
Can you feel it?

48:45.465 --> 48:46.966
This is our place.

48:49.677 --> 48:51.429
This is where I’ll be, Louis.

48:52.639 --> 48:54.265
When you need me.

49:13.951 --> 49:15.953
[Louis, in high voice]
Stuffed mouse for lunch,

49:16.037 --> 49:17.497
Mrs Wain?

49:19.499 --> 49:21.584
No, thank you, Peter.

49:21.668 --> 49:24.420
I’m not partial to mouse,
personally.

49:25.254 --> 49:27.882
[Louis] Sparrow pie?

49:27.965 --> 49:29.467
[sighs]

49:29.550 --> 49:31.844
I don’t care for sparrow either,
truth be told.

49:31.928 --> 49:34.555
-It’s a bit gristly.
-Oh.

49:34.639 --> 49:37.892
-Perhaps a slice of...
-Oh, could you stop it, please?

49:39.852 --> 49:42.480
I don’t have an appetite today.
I’m a bit tired.

49:44.565 --> 49:45.608
What’s the matter?

49:48.111 --> 49:49.862
I have cancer, Louis.

49:51.406 --> 49:53.074
I’m in quite a lot of pain.

49:59.956 --> 50:01.249
[Louis] Ready?

50:01.332 --> 50:03.584
That depends on what
you’re about to show me.

50:03.668 --> 50:05.002
[Louis] Ta-da!

50:07.004 --> 50:09.132
Oh, Louis. [chuckles]

50:10.842 --> 50:13.761
When did you do all this?
Has Sir William seen these?

50:13.845 --> 50:16.180
Sir William hasn’t seen these.
These are for you, Emily.

50:16.264 --> 50:18.015
-Well, you must show him.
-Why?

50:18.099 --> 50:20.852
Sir William doesn’t care
for Peter, does he, now?

50:20.935 --> 50:23.104
And besides, I shall be...

50:24.689 --> 50:29.068
I shall be spending more time
with you while you’re still...

50:29.152 --> 50:30.862
I’m the one who’s ill, Louis.

50:32.071 --> 50:33.906
Don’t you start wallowing
in it too.

50:39.537 --> 50:40.955
[Louis] Sir William!

50:44.333 --> 50:46.919
Sir William! Whoo-oo!

50:51.090 --> 50:52.383
Sir William!

50:55.970 --> 50:58.181
[Emily] Whoo-oo! Sir William!

51:01.142 --> 51:03.311
[Louis] Whoo-oo! Sir William!

51:03.394 --> 51:04.520
[man] Excuse me.

51:06.063 --> 51:07.440
Excuse me, sir.

51:07.523 --> 51:08.775
-Oi!
-Whoo!

51:08.858 --> 51:11.360
Oi! Stop!

51:13.029 --> 51:14.530
-Oi!
-[laughs]

51:14.614 --> 51:17.033
This club’s
for gentlemen only!

51:17.116 --> 51:19.744
[Emily laughs and screams]

51:22.580 --> 51:26.083
I’m sorry she wasn’t allowed in,
old boy. I did try.

51:27.585 --> 51:30.838
[Louis] It wasn’t a very
convincing disguise, was it?

51:30.922 --> 51:32.173
[Louis chuckles]

51:33.925 --> 51:36.177
[Sir William]
She should be at home resting.

51:40.890 --> 51:42.391
[Louis] It was her idea.

51:47.063 --> 51:48.523
CATTY MEWS

51:48.606 --> 51:49.732
[Sir William] Hmm.

51:49.816 --> 51:50.817
MILK

51:53.569 --> 51:56.531
Very sorry if we’ve wasted
your time, Sir William.

52:01.577 --> 52:02.787
Yes.

52:07.708 --> 52:12.088
I have two pages earmarked
in the Christmas edition.

52:12.171 --> 52:14.799
Reserved for a bit
of festive frivolity.

52:14.882 --> 52:17.301
Something to raise the spirits
of our readers.

52:18.553 --> 52:21.764
I’d like you to fill them
with cats.

52:22.765 --> 52:25.726
With... cats?

52:27.562 --> 52:30.398
Yes. With cats.

52:32.400 --> 52:34.443
Don’t you think perhaps
a spread of silly dogs

52:34.527 --> 52:36.279
would be more appealing
for your readership?

52:36.362 --> 52:37.947
I’ve seen dogs before.

52:38.030 --> 52:43.160
And you capture
something of the cat, Louis.

52:43.244 --> 52:46.372
Perhaps because you yourself
are a bit of a renegade.

52:46.455 --> 52:48.916
An outcast, dare I say.

52:51.335 --> 52:57.091
How you’ve managed to conjure
images of such delight

52:57.842 --> 53:00.011
at such a dark time...

53:01.846 --> 53:03.347
I don’t know.

53:13.816 --> 53:15.860
[children laughing]

53:19.280 --> 53:20.448
Merry Christmas.

53:25.244 --> 53:27.496
[boy] Illustrated London News!

53:28.956 --> 53:31.167
Illustrated London News!

53:53.105 --> 53:54.732
[Emily] Throughout history,

53:54.815 --> 53:57.944
cats have been worshipped
as mystical gods

53:59.570 --> 54:03.324
and maligned as the evil allies
of witchery and sin.

54:05.618 --> 54:08.871
But I think you’re the
first person ever to see

54:08.955 --> 54:11.624
that they are
in fact ridiculous.

54:14.001 --> 54:16.337
They’re silly and cuddly.

54:18.130 --> 54:19.382
And lonely.

54:20.716 --> 54:22.385
And frightened and brave.

54:24.261 --> 54:25.513
Like us.

54:30.351 --> 54:32.478
One day, I don’t think
it’ll be so peculiar

54:32.561 --> 54:34.772
to have a cat in the house
as a little pet.

54:45.116 --> 54:47.743
What’s going on in that
funny little head of yours?

55:00.214 --> 55:01.507
Sometimes...

55:06.137 --> 55:08.431
I think about the day
you won’t be here...

55:11.517 --> 55:12.685
and...

55:16.480 --> 55:18.065
I have to say, Emily,

55:18.149 --> 55:20.234
I find it intolerably
difficult to imagine.

55:26.157 --> 55:27.992
I will be so very alone.

55:31.078 --> 55:32.830
You’ll be all right, Louis.

55:34.498 --> 55:35.833
You’ll have Peter.

55:43.007 --> 55:46.635
This time with you, Emily...

55:51.515 --> 55:54.643
playing with Peter in the
evening, sitting by the fire...

55:58.564 --> 56:01.150
these have been the best days
of my entire life.

56:05.613 --> 56:08.157
I don’t know why it is
that I find it so very difficult

56:08.240 --> 56:12.078
just being here
on this earth, but...

56:13.913 --> 56:15.915
I can say with absolute
certainty

56:15.998 --> 56:20.169
that you have made it
much, much better.

56:25.091 --> 56:27.051
You make the world beautiful...

56:30.387 --> 56:32.890
and warm and kind.

56:38.187 --> 56:41.440
I just wanted to say thank you
for that before it’s too late.

56:47.029 --> 56:49.532
I don’t make
the world beautiful, Louis.

56:52.535 --> 56:54.161
The world is beautiful.

56:56.872 --> 56:58.958
And you’ve helped me
to see that too.

57:03.754 --> 57:05.089
Just remember...

57:07.591 --> 57:10.511
hmm, however hard
things get...

57:13.180 --> 57:15.599
however much you feel
like you’re struggling...

57:18.894 --> 57:21.021
the world is full of beauty.

57:24.608 --> 57:26.902
And it’s up to you
to capture it, Louis.

57:28.904 --> 57:30.072
To look.

57:33.075 --> 57:35.786
And to share it
with as many people as you can.

57:41.125 --> 57:42.626
You are a prism.

57:44.920 --> 57:47.506
Through which
that beam of life refracts.

59:35.906 --> 59:38.158
[clattering]

59:38.242 --> 59:40.703
[humming]

1:00:01.223 --> 1:00:03.183
Here we are.

1:00:03.267 --> 1:00:07.646
A special New Year’s breakfast
for you today, Mrs Wain.

1:00:07.730 --> 1:00:09.523
Don’t worry, Peter.

1:00:09.606 --> 1:00:11.483
Yes, I haven’t forgotten
about your eggs.

1:00:36.008 --> 1:00:38.093
[strikes match repeatedly]

1:00:38.177 --> 1:00:39.636
[meowing]

1:01:37.444 --> 1:01:38.612
Thank you.

1:02:06.390 --> 1:02:08.225
1891

1:02:08.308 --> 1:02:12.187
Louis Wain special
in the Illustrated London News!

1:02:12.271 --> 1:02:15.816
Come and get it!
Illustrated London News!

1:02:15.899 --> 1:02:17.776
[narrator]
In the years following,

1:02:17.860 --> 1:02:20.070
Louis buried
the pain of his grief

1:02:20.154 --> 1:02:23.323
under a quite extraordinary
quantity of cat pictures.

1:02:25.742 --> 1:02:27.744
Almost without realising,

1:02:27.828 --> 1:02:30.247
he had achieved
an alarming degree of success

1:02:30.330 --> 1:02:32.624
and completely altered
the public’s attitude

1:02:32.708 --> 1:02:34.293
towards the humble cat.

1:02:34.376 --> 1:02:36.879
[woman] Look! There he is!
Louis Wain!

1:02:42.801 --> 1:02:45.929
Your cats have won you
many fans, Wain.

1:02:46.013 --> 1:02:47.639
Congratulations.

1:02:47.723 --> 1:02:50.517
He says thank you,
but go easy on the sherry.

1:02:50.601 --> 1:02:53.187
You don’t mind if I work
for other people, do you?

1:02:53.270 --> 1:02:55.147
[laughs] That’s the cheek

1:02:55.230 --> 1:02:57.608
that’s catapulted you
to fame, my boy.

1:02:57.691 --> 1:03:00.319
Oh, we’ve had a telegram
from Miss Judith Shenton

1:03:00.402 --> 1:03:02.070
of the National Cat Club.

1:03:02.154 --> 1:03:03.906
They’re having
a kind of cat competition

1:03:03.989 --> 1:03:05.532
and would like you
to judge it.

1:03:05.616 --> 1:03:07.326
[Judith]
It’s so wonderful to meet

1:03:07.409 --> 1:03:09.161
a kindred spirit, Mr Wain.

1:03:09.244 --> 1:03:12.498
I’ve heard even gentry
are keeping cats as pets now.

1:03:12.581 --> 1:03:14.791
-Hmm.
-And so handsome too.

1:03:14.875 --> 1:03:17.878
I’m just astonished at your
level of knowledge, I really am.

1:03:17.961 --> 1:03:21.215
Although I must admit, I don’t
fully understand your theory

1:03:21.298 --> 1:03:23.217
about cats preferring
to face north.

1:03:23.300 --> 1:03:25.594
Cats will always prefer
to face and walk north,

1:03:25.677 --> 1:03:27.304
especially along a wall,
you will notice.

1:03:27.387 --> 1:03:29.014
Their whiskers act
as antennae,

1:03:29.097 --> 1:03:31.225
attracted to the positive poles
of the earth.

1:03:31.308 --> 1:03:32.809
The tabby’s markings
are defined

1:03:32.893 --> 1:03:34.811
by the electricity
of their feline heritage.

1:03:34.895 --> 1:03:36.522
This particular animal
might have had

1:03:36.605 --> 1:03:39.024
a great-grandmother
that was struck by lightning,

1:03:39.107 --> 1:03:41.318
so defined are the markings
by the jaggedy lines.

1:03:41.401 --> 1:03:44.530
-Fascinating.
-Electricity. From the head.

1:03:44.613 --> 1:03:47.115
Right down the body
to the tail.

1:03:47.199 --> 1:03:49.159
Cats are excellent
conductors of electricity.

1:03:49.243 --> 1:03:50.702
Their features
are already changing

1:03:50.786 --> 1:03:52.663
as they become more domesticated
and intelligent.

1:03:52.746 --> 1:03:54.331
Their eyes will become larger,
their heads bigger

1:03:54.414 --> 1:03:55.791
as their brains grow in size.

1:03:55.874 --> 1:03:57.209
They will turn blue.

1:03:57.292 --> 1:03:59.294
Eventually, they will stand
on their own hind legs

1:03:59.378 --> 1:04:01.004
and communicate to us
in our own language.

1:04:01.088 --> 1:04:03.840
Gosh. I’d no idea
it was so complicated.

1:04:03.924 --> 1:04:05.634
Did you say
that they would turn blue?

1:04:05.717 --> 1:04:08.470
-Yes. Of course.
-Wow.

1:04:08.554 --> 1:04:11.056
Well, Mr Wain, thanks to you,

1:04:11.139 --> 1:04:13.267
us cat people
are out of the shadows

1:04:13.350 --> 1:04:15.769
and finally able to celebrate
in the open

1:04:15.852 --> 1:04:17.604
with our feline children.

1:04:17.688 --> 1:04:19.022
I’d like to thank you.

1:04:19.106 --> 1:04:20.482
Oh, sorry.

1:04:20.566 --> 1:04:22.150
Yep. Arm in.

1:04:23.777 --> 1:04:26.780
The new president
of the National Cat Club.

1:04:26.863 --> 1:04:28.198
Is that what it says?

1:04:29.241 --> 1:04:32.995
NATIONAL CAT CLUB
DEPTFORD LONDON

1:04:47.384 --> 1:04:49.678
I assumed you’d been spending
it all on frivolous luxuries.

1:04:49.761 --> 1:04:51.179
’Cause you’ve forgotten
about your family.

1:04:51.263 --> 1:04:53.432
Yet here you are
living in squalor and chaos!

1:04:53.515 --> 1:04:56.101
-Don’t shout, Caroline!
-I am not shouting, Claire!

1:04:56.184 --> 1:04:57.894
I’m explaining
to him with force.

1:04:57.978 --> 1:05:00.772
There’s a cadaver now.
It’s eating a hawk.

1:05:00.856 --> 1:05:02.357
[Caroline]
Where has it all gone?

1:05:02.441 --> 1:05:04.860
[Josephine] We’re in huge
amounts of debt.

1:05:04.943 --> 1:05:06.820
It’s really starting to affect
Mother’s health.

1:05:06.903 --> 1:05:09.573
-Where has it all gone?
-I didn’t copyright the images.

1:05:10.574 --> 1:05:11.992
Oh, my God.

1:05:14.036 --> 1:05:16.246
-Oh, my God, help us, please.
-What does that mean?

1:05:16.330 --> 1:05:18.540
It means people have been
reprinting his pictures

1:05:18.624 --> 1:05:20.667
all over the country
and he hasn’t seen a penny.

1:05:20.751 --> 1:05:23.045
Which explains why he is living
rather like a pig.

1:05:23.128 --> 1:05:24.880
The stench
is quite unbearable.

1:05:24.963 --> 1:05:27.132
Some of the originals I have
exchanged in place of money.

1:05:27.215 --> 1:05:28.925
So, in fact, they’ve become

1:05:29.009 --> 1:05:30.802
a sort of currency
in themselves.

1:05:30.886 --> 1:05:33.680
I gave the barber, well,
a handful of dancing cats,

1:05:33.764 --> 1:05:35.932
and now I have free haircuts
for the rest of my life.

1:05:36.016 --> 1:05:37.601
You’re not a child, Louis!

1:05:38.810 --> 1:05:40.312
You’re the man.

1:05:43.023 --> 1:05:44.316
You’re a man.

1:05:46.401 --> 1:05:48.487
Our parents worked hard
for our reputation.

1:05:48.570 --> 1:05:50.864
They worked hard to build
a fortune for their children,

1:05:50.947 --> 1:05:55.452
and you have squandered it
on wretched cats!

1:05:55.535 --> 1:05:58.830
And on a wilful, doomed,
tainted romance.

1:05:58.914 --> 1:06:01.458
You’ve destroyed our family
with your selfishness

1:06:01.541 --> 1:06:03.960
and you continue
with your childish delusions

1:06:04.044 --> 1:06:05.796
which conspire
to keep us all in penury.

1:06:05.879 --> 1:06:08.632
The indignity that we’ve
suffered at your hands, Louis.

1:06:08.715 --> 1:06:11.134
-I didn’t do it on purpose.
-You didn’t do what on purpose?

1:06:11.218 --> 1:06:13.053
You didn’t get married
on purpose?

1:06:13.136 --> 1:06:14.596
[Louis mumbles]

1:06:18.141 --> 1:06:19.226
[sighs]

1:06:25.273 --> 1:06:27.609
No one told me I needed
to copyright the images.

1:06:27.693 --> 1:06:29.778
What about Sir William?
He should have advised you.

1:06:29.861 --> 1:06:31.822
I haven’t seen Sir William
for some time now.

1:06:31.905 --> 1:06:34.533
-I am working for other people.
-We don’t have any money, Louis.

1:06:34.616 --> 1:06:36.326
And poor Marie...

1:06:41.665 --> 1:06:42.749
What?

1:06:44.084 --> 1:06:45.085
What?

1:06:45.877 --> 1:06:47.170
Just tell him.

1:06:49.923 --> 1:06:51.299
What has happened?

1:06:56.138 --> 1:06:57.889
[Marie] They hate me, Louis.

1:06:57.973 --> 1:06:59.850
They’re plotting.
They’re going to murder me.

1:06:59.933 --> 1:07:02.394
-We’re not going to murder you.
-Liar!

1:07:02.477 --> 1:07:05.480
They’re going to throw me out
because I had relations.

1:07:05.564 --> 1:07:07.774
I had relations
in the graveyard.

1:07:08.734 --> 1:07:10.110
And we laughed.

1:07:12.028 --> 1:07:15.031
They’re just jealous
because I saw heaven.

1:07:15.115 --> 1:07:17.826
And that’s why I’ve got
the leprosy as punishment.

1:07:18.744 --> 1:07:20.370
They’re all spinsters.

1:07:20.454 --> 1:07:23.957
They say it’s your fault.
Because of Miss Richardson.

1:07:25.208 --> 1:07:27.252
But it’s because they’re ugly

1:07:27.335 --> 1:07:29.671
and they lie
and plot and scheme.

1:07:29.755 --> 1:07:32.674
Marie, why don’t you
come and stay with me?

1:07:32.758 --> 1:07:36.136
-And you can play with the cats.
-No, no, no, no, not cats.

1:07:36.219 --> 1:07:38.305
They’re poisonous
and they’ve got diseases.

1:07:38.388 --> 1:07:40.515
And I’ve already got leprosy.

1:07:40.599 --> 1:07:43.185
Get it off me, Louis!
Get it off me!

1:07:43.268 --> 1:07:47.147
Get it off me! Get it off me!
[sobs]

1:07:47.230 --> 1:07:49.483
[Felicie] It’s going to be okay.
We’re all here for you.

1:07:49.566 --> 1:07:52.027
[narrator] After a local
doctor’s tentative diagnosis

1:07:52.110 --> 1:07:53.820
of schizophrenia,

1:07:53.904 --> 1:07:56.281
the Wain family had done
everything they could

1:07:56.364 --> 1:07:58.074
for poor Marie.

1:07:58.158 --> 1:08:00.410
But Louis was at a loss,

1:08:00.494 --> 1:08:03.121
and so he went to an old friend
for advice.

1:08:03.205 --> 1:08:05.665
THE ILLUSTRATED
LONDON NEWS

1:08:05.749 --> 1:08:07.667
[Sir William]
I have a series of properties

1:08:07.751 --> 1:08:09.711
in the village
of Westgate-on-Sea.

1:08:09.795 --> 1:08:11.379
They’re quite habitable

1:08:11.463 --> 1:08:13.799
and you’re welcome to stay there
for as long as you like,

1:08:13.882 --> 1:08:16.301
at a reduced rate,
on one condition.

1:08:17.803 --> 1:08:21.681
-You take your family with you.
-I...

1:08:21.765 --> 1:08:23.475
I couldn’t possibly,
Sir William.

1:08:24.893 --> 1:08:27.103
Especially after I’ve been
so callously unloyal.

1:08:29.815 --> 1:08:33.151
I have plenty of illustrators
on my books, Mr Wain.

1:08:33.235 --> 1:08:36.863
-Don’t flatter yourself.
-Why, then, Sir William?

1:08:40.075 --> 1:08:43.995
Because in spite of your
rather irregular temperament

1:08:44.079 --> 1:08:47.666
and nigglingly
peculiar foibles,

1:08:47.749 --> 1:08:50.085
in this occasionally
bleak world,

1:08:50.168 --> 1:08:53.004
you have shown a resilience
that I admire.

1:08:53.088 --> 1:08:54.965
And if you must know,

1:08:55.048 --> 1:08:57.634
you’ve brought me rather a lot
of cheer with your pictures.

1:08:57.717 --> 1:08:59.010
Of cats?

1:08:59.970 --> 1:09:01.304
[Sir William] Mmm.

1:09:01.388 --> 1:09:03.306
But they’re not just cats,
are they?

1:09:05.016 --> 1:09:07.102
You are a brave soul, Louis,

1:09:07.185 --> 1:09:09.062
but you can’t do all this
on your own.

1:09:09.145 --> 1:09:12.774
It sounds to me like Marie
needs a change of scenery.

1:09:12.858 --> 1:09:16.236
Fresh clothes,
proper food, brisk walks.

1:09:22.367 --> 1:09:24.744
-Thank you. Just in there.
-Yes, sir.

1:09:24.828 --> 1:09:27.539
-[sisters] Louis!
-Hello! Hello! Hello!

1:09:27.622 --> 1:09:31.084
-It’s wonderful, Louis.
-Welcome to Bendigo Lodge.

1:09:31.167 --> 1:09:32.586
BENDIGO LODGE

1:09:35.255 --> 1:09:37.132
Caroline, welcome.

1:09:37.215 --> 1:09:38.758
Louis, it’s lovely.

1:09:40.510 --> 1:09:42.888
Welcome to Bendigo Lodge,
Mother.

1:09:42.971 --> 1:09:44.639
-[Claire] Ooh, Bendigo.
-[Felicie] Bendigo.

1:09:44.723 --> 1:09:45.974
It’s perfect.

1:10:00.071 --> 1:10:02.741
[breathes deeply]

1:10:02.824 --> 1:10:06.786
[all] Bless us, oh, Lord,
for these, thy gifts,

1:10:06.870 --> 1:10:09.831
which we are about to receive
from thy bounty...

1:10:09.915 --> 1:10:12.667
Well done, Peter.
You show them how to eat.

1:10:12.751 --> 1:10:15.587
Very good manners. Nina, try
and slow down a little bit.

1:10:15.670 --> 1:10:17.839
You’re terribly tiny to be
eating that much so quickly.

1:10:17.923 --> 1:10:19.341
Pass me your plate.

1:10:22.177 --> 1:10:23.637
Felicie, plate.

1:10:24.471 --> 1:10:27.223
That’s it. Well done.

1:10:29.309 --> 1:10:31.144
We could go
and walk tomorrow,

1:10:31.227 --> 1:10:33.813
wear our nice clothes
and smile at men.

1:10:33.897 --> 1:10:35.941
-[Claire] They’ll run away.
-[Felicie] Run away?

1:10:36.024 --> 1:10:38.068
I don’t want to run away.
We just got here.

1:10:38.151 --> 1:10:40.403
[Josephine] So what
are we looking for, then?

1:10:40.487 --> 1:10:42.405
-[Mrs Wain] A writer.
-[Josephine] Oh, no.

1:10:42.489 --> 1:10:44.532
[Mrs Wain]
Who writes for the newspaper.

1:10:44.616 --> 1:10:46.493
[Felicie] No. A doctor.

1:10:46.576 --> 1:10:48.578
[Josephine]
I would like dark hair.

1:10:48.662 --> 1:10:50.246
-[Claire] Dark hair.
-[Felicie] Blond.

1:10:50.330 --> 1:10:52.499
[Mrs Wain]
Oh, no. Untrustworthy.

1:10:52.582 --> 1:10:54.626
[excited chatter]

1:10:54.709 --> 1:10:57.045
[squealing]

1:10:57.128 --> 1:11:00.757
[Claire] Give me the pillow,
Josephine!

1:11:05.345 --> 1:11:08.181
[Louis] I think for you still
it’s better beside your legs.

1:11:08.264 --> 1:11:09.516
[Felicie] That was good.

1:11:09.599 --> 1:11:11.643
[Louis] Triumph.
I get another go.

1:11:12.852 --> 1:11:14.688
-[Caroline] Shall we shell?
-[Louis groans]

1:11:16.189 --> 1:11:18.066
[meowing]

1:11:18.149 --> 1:11:19.859
-Some plates.
-Bravo.

1:11:19.943 --> 1:11:22.028
-They’re a little fancy.
-Ooh.

1:11:22.112 --> 1:11:24.239
Yes, don’t drop them, please.

1:11:24.322 --> 1:11:26.616
Felicie, did you see
a better knife than this?

1:11:26.700 --> 1:11:29.369
-[Felicie] Why?
-’Cause this one’s dreadful.

1:11:29.452 --> 1:11:31.246
[Felicie] All right.

1:11:31.329 --> 1:11:32.914
[Caroline] Or a sharpener.

1:11:34.416 --> 1:11:36.334
[Felicie] I’ll go
and get the pie.

1:12:13.329 --> 1:12:16.207
IN NURSERYLAND
WITH LOUIS WAIN

1:12:16.291 --> 1:12:18.293
THE LOUIS WAIN
NURSERY BOOK

1:12:19.836 --> 1:12:21.921
DADDY CAT
LOUIS WAIN

1:12:45.028 --> 1:12:46.529
[Peter meows] Louis?

1:12:50.658 --> 1:12:53.328
[Louis] It’s all right.
Not long now, Peter.

1:12:55.330 --> 1:12:58.041
[Peter meows]
Where are we going?

1:12:58.124 --> 1:13:00.752
[throbbing electrical drone]

1:13:05.715 --> 1:13:07.801
[Peter meows]
Where are we going?

1:13:09.719 --> 1:13:11.596
[Mrs Wain] I think
we should stop quite soon.

1:13:11.679 --> 1:13:14.224
-[Josephine] Are you tired?
-[Mrs Wain] I’m quite tired.

1:13:21.272 --> 1:13:22.899
[Mrs Wain] Louis?

1:13:22.982 --> 1:13:24.150
-Lunch.
-Come.

1:13:24.234 --> 1:13:25.819
-Come and eat.
-Come.

1:13:27.946 --> 1:13:30.824
[Marie] I think he’s trying
to divert the electricity.

1:13:30.907 --> 1:13:33.118
[Mrs Wain] Oh, that again.

1:13:33.201 --> 1:13:38.039
[squealing, laughing]

1:13:48.007 --> 1:13:49.676
[Marie] I’m scared, Louis.

1:13:54.264 --> 1:13:55.515
[Louis] Me too.

1:14:00.061 --> 1:14:01.229
[meows]

1:14:01.312 --> 1:14:02.605
[sobbing]

1:14:02.689 --> 1:14:04.774
1900

1:14:04.858 --> 1:14:07.819
[Marie] Get off me! Get off me!

1:14:07.902 --> 1:14:09.737
No, I said, get off!

1:14:10.655 --> 1:14:12.365
Let go of me!

1:14:12.448 --> 1:14:14.534
[narrator] His sisters
went several years more

1:14:14.617 --> 1:14:17.245
without finding
a single suitor,

1:14:17.328 --> 1:14:20.206
and in spite of Sir William’s
cheery prognosis,

1:14:20.290 --> 1:14:22.834
Marie’s condition
did not improve.

1:14:22.917 --> 1:14:24.919
-Dr Elphick.
-Miss Wain.

1:14:28.173 --> 1:14:31.509
After the catastrophic marriage
of their only son,

1:14:31.593 --> 1:14:33.678
the fact that one
of their number

1:14:33.761 --> 1:14:36.556
was now officially
a raving lunatic

1:14:36.639 --> 1:14:40.018
did nothing to help
the family’s social status.

1:14:40.101 --> 1:14:42.228
-Thank you, Doctor.
-All the best.

1:14:47.609 --> 1:14:52.447
[narrator] And then, his great
teacher and best friend,

1:14:52.530 --> 1:14:55.950
his dear old Peter,
passed away.

1:15:07.503 --> 1:15:10.423
Like a frenzied bat
in a burning oven,

1:15:10.506 --> 1:15:14.010
Louis’ heart was a screaming,
flapping mess.

1:15:14.093 --> 1:15:16.930
He wept without ceasing
for several years,

1:15:17.013 --> 1:15:18.932
but at the same time,

1:15:19.015 --> 1:15:22.518
he was overtaken by an
extraordinary new discovery,

1:15:23.770 --> 1:15:25.939
that the more intensely
he suffered,

1:15:26.022 --> 1:15:28.775
the more beautiful
his work became.

1:15:28.858 --> 1:15:31.152
He realised
that the memories he still held

1:15:31.236 --> 1:15:34.155
of his dear wife, Emily,
and darling Peter

1:15:34.239 --> 1:15:36.074
had become
powerful conductors

1:15:36.157 --> 1:15:39.661
of that mysterious electricity
in the atmosphere

1:15:39.744 --> 1:15:42.538
that he had so far
been unable to harness.

1:15:44.165 --> 1:15:45.959
[thunder crashes]

1:16:19.158 --> 1:16:22.245
[panting]

1:16:42.098 --> 1:16:43.808
[thunder crashes]

1:16:46.811 --> 1:16:48.438
-Mr Wain?
-[Louis] Hmm?

1:16:48.521 --> 1:16:50.606
Are you aware of the reason
I’ve been summoned?

1:16:50.690 --> 1:16:52.150
I assume it’s to inform us

1:16:52.233 --> 1:16:54.068
on how Marie is doing
in the asylum.

1:16:54.152 --> 1:16:56.779
That or to conduct a study on
the neural evolution of my cats.

1:16:56.863 --> 1:16:59.907
Bridget’s already halfway
to talking. Aren’t you, Bridget?

1:16:59.991 --> 1:17:03.453
I’m afraid not, Mr Wain.
Although since you ask,

1:17:03.536 --> 1:17:05.580
Marie seems to be
coping much better of late.

1:17:05.663 --> 1:17:07.206
[Louis] I’m very glad
to hear it.

1:17:07.290 --> 1:17:09.042
I have been working
on a psychiatric patent

1:17:09.125 --> 1:17:10.752
that I meant to show you.

1:17:10.835 --> 1:17:13.212
-It’s for an electric suit.
-An electric suit?

1:17:13.296 --> 1:17:15.298
Full body suit.
Made of copper and silken steel.

1:17:15.381 --> 1:17:17.300
Attached to a large
mechanical motor

1:17:17.383 --> 1:17:18.968
that transmits
a positive current

1:17:19.052 --> 1:17:20.970
through the nervous system
and into the brain,

1:17:21.054 --> 1:17:22.680
thus curing the patient
of all harmful thoughts

1:17:22.764 --> 1:17:24.349
and eradicating
their lunacies entirely.

1:17:24.432 --> 1:17:26.100
Would you care
to take a look at it?

1:17:26.184 --> 1:17:28.686
-No, thank you, Mr Wain.
-That’s a shame.

1:17:28.770 --> 1:17:30.396
I think there’s
a very high chance

1:17:30.480 --> 1:17:32.690
that it could cure Marie
entirely of her sickness.

1:17:34.817 --> 1:17:36.778
I’ve been called here, Mr Wain,

1:17:36.861 --> 1:17:39.822
because your sister Caroline
is concerned for your health.

1:17:39.906 --> 1:17:42.367
My health? Why would she be
concerned about my health?

1:17:42.450 --> 1:17:44.702
It’s not just Caroline
who is concerned, Louis.

1:17:44.786 --> 1:17:46.579
I understand you’re
planning a trip, Mr Wain?

1:17:46.662 --> 1:17:48.331
Indeed. I have sent

1:17:48.414 --> 1:17:50.416
some colourful missives
to several publications,

1:17:50.500 --> 1:17:51.918
including some new examples.

1:17:52.001 --> 1:17:54.128
More electrically
influenced samplings.

1:17:54.212 --> 1:17:57.173
I’m happy to say
the great William Hearst

1:17:57.256 --> 1:17:59.884
of the New York American
has offered me a full-time post

1:17:59.967 --> 1:18:01.886
as their cartoonist
at a considerable fee.

1:18:01.969 --> 1:18:04.722
Why do you have to go
to New York? It’s too far.

1:18:04.806 --> 1:18:06.349
Over 3,000 miles.

1:18:06.432 --> 1:18:08.351
Because, as you are
all so keen to remind me,

1:18:08.434 --> 1:18:09.977
we are lacking in funds
at the minute.

1:18:10.061 --> 1:18:12.438
This is not our house.
We are in debt.

1:18:12.522 --> 1:18:14.065
And for a variety of reasons

1:18:14.148 --> 1:18:15.817
that we are very well
acquainted with,

1:18:15.900 --> 1:18:19.320
my work is currently
of little value on these shores.

1:18:19.404 --> 1:18:21.364
What’s more,
the people of America

1:18:21.447 --> 1:18:23.825
are light years behind
in their attitude towards cats.

1:18:23.908 --> 1:18:25.535
I assume you’ve been reading
about Roosevelt

1:18:25.618 --> 1:18:27.703
and his Gentlemen’s Agreement
with the people of Japan.

1:18:27.787 --> 1:18:29.080
Japanese children
will now be taught

1:18:29.163 --> 1:18:31.040
in the same school
as their American compatriots

1:18:31.124 --> 1:18:32.750
and their immigrant parents
can freely roam

1:18:32.834 --> 1:18:34.877
in the streets of America,
but can their cats?

1:18:34.961 --> 1:18:37.213
I have helped this country
a great deal in this regard.

1:18:37.296 --> 1:18:39.006
Now I must help
the cats of America.

1:18:39.090 --> 1:18:41.217
For better or worse,
Dr Elphick, I am a prism

1:18:41.300 --> 1:18:43.386
and a transformative funnel
for negative electricity.

1:18:43.469 --> 1:18:44.720
In these tumultuous times,

1:18:44.804 --> 1:18:46.431
I want to make the people
of America smile.

1:18:46.514 --> 1:18:48.057
I’ve never seen an American
smile in my life.

1:18:48.141 --> 1:18:49.475
You have never seen
an American.

1:18:49.559 --> 1:18:50.768
It’s time to change that.

1:18:50.852 --> 1:18:52.186
The only reason
that you are here

1:18:52.270 --> 1:18:53.688
is my sister has summoned you

1:18:53.771 --> 1:18:55.189
because she is
extremely jealous

1:18:55.273 --> 1:18:56.941
and has been
since I was 12 years old

1:18:57.024 --> 1:18:59.610
and will do anything to prevent
me reaching my full potential.

1:19:01.404 --> 1:19:05.283
Mr Wain, there is no question
that you are delusional.

1:19:05.366 --> 1:19:07.034
But mere delusions
of grandeur

1:19:07.118 --> 1:19:09.412
are not sufficient reason
to commit you to hospital.

1:19:09.495 --> 1:19:12.957
I would quite strongly advise
against your trip to New York.

1:19:13.040 --> 1:19:14.834
I’d suggest you stay here
to rest,

1:19:14.917 --> 1:19:16.586
gain a little perspective

1:19:16.669 --> 1:19:19.130
before you proceed to the
next chapter of your life.

1:19:19.213 --> 1:19:20.840
But ultimately,
the choice is yours.

1:19:37.231 --> 1:19:40.234
[Mrs Wain] You can run away
from your family, Louis.

1:19:42.069 --> 1:19:44.322
You cannot run away
from your grief.

1:19:47.158 --> 1:19:48.951
It trails you.

1:19:50.369 --> 1:19:52.705
Like a violent shadow.

1:20:01.255 --> 1:20:05.843
1907

1:20:16.479 --> 1:20:18.397
You, sir, you seem
like the kind of man

1:20:18.481 --> 1:20:20.107
who wants to keep up
with the times.

1:20:20.191 --> 1:20:21.817
The New York Times.

1:20:49.512 --> 1:20:51.055
[man] Chateau Guiraud.
Hurry up.

1:20:51.138 --> 1:20:52.223
Yes, sir, yes.

1:20:52.306 --> 1:20:54.225
[narrator] Upon arriving
in New York,

1:20:54.308 --> 1:20:56.894
Louis was immediately struck
by a palpable difference

1:20:56.978 --> 1:20:59.647
in the material content
of the atmosphere.

1:20:59.730 --> 1:21:02.233
It was clear
that this was a city

1:21:02.316 --> 1:21:04.860
with an enormous surfeit
of electrical energy.

1:21:04.944 --> 1:21:06.612
Get those drinks
to table nine now.

1:21:06.696 --> 1:21:07.697
Yes, sir.

1:21:08.990 --> 1:21:11.450
Every cat fancier knows
puss loves nothing more

1:21:11.534 --> 1:21:13.411
than to sit
on a piece of brown paper.

1:21:13.494 --> 1:21:16.497
Cats are aware of the dangers
of electrical rheumatism,

1:21:16.581 --> 1:21:18.916
and of course if you ever need
to punish a cat,

1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:21.627
you could just crumple the paper
to make the sound of thunder.

1:21:21.711 --> 1:21:24.255
-Do cats get rheumatism?
-Yes, of course, Miss Simmonds.

1:21:24.338 --> 1:21:28.759
Mr Wain, we have been showing
your cat pictures to our staff.

1:21:28.843 --> 1:21:31.220
They’ve been laughing.
They’ve been smiling.

1:21:31.304 --> 1:21:33.222
Tell him, Alicia.
Tell him I’m not lying.

1:21:33.306 --> 1:21:36.225
One of our typists, she took
some your pictures to her kids

1:21:36.309 --> 1:21:38.561
and she said that
they were running about

1:21:38.644 --> 1:21:41.188
on their hands and knees,
pretending to be cats.

1:21:41.272 --> 1:21:43.941
Pretending to be cats!
How cute!

1:21:44.025 --> 1:21:47.028
[Alicia] And asking to have cats
for their birthday.

1:21:47.111 --> 1:21:49.488
We’re gonna get you out there.
You’re a personality.

1:21:49.572 --> 1:21:53.618
Wouldn’t you say, Alicia, honey?
You’re Mr Cat.

1:21:53.701 --> 1:21:55.411
-You’re Cat Man.
-[Alicia] Cat Man.

1:21:55.494 --> 1:21:57.830
-He’s Cat Man.
-Cat Man.

1:21:57.913 --> 1:22:00.291
[Alicia] I think that has
a certain ring to it.

1:22:01.667 --> 1:22:04.128
But I like Louis Wain.

1:22:05.212 --> 1:22:07.340
I think that has
a certain ring to it too.

1:22:08.466 --> 1:22:10.092
[meowing]

1:22:10.176 --> 1:22:12.094
Can I ask you a question,
Mr Wain?

1:22:13.137 --> 1:22:14.597
Why cats?

1:22:16.766 --> 1:22:19.185
[static on radio]

1:22:32.448 --> 1:22:34.533
[Emily] Just remember,

1:22:34.617 --> 1:22:36.452
however hard things get,

1:22:36.535 --> 1:22:39.163
however much you feel
like you’re struggling...

1:22:40.289 --> 1:22:42.625
the world is full of beauty.

1:22:44.210 --> 1:22:46.462
And it’s up to you
to capture it, Louis.

1:22:47.755 --> 1:22:49.632
To look.

1:22:49.715 --> 1:22:52.635
And to share it
with as many people as you can.

1:22:52.718 --> 1:22:56.347
[distorted meowing]

1:22:57.973 --> 1:22:58.974
[gasps]

1:23:01.602 --> 1:23:03.854
[breathes heavily]

1:23:06.649 --> 1:23:08.192
You all right, Mr Wain?

1:23:09.610 --> 1:23:12.196
[Louis] Her whispers come
in the leafy tickle of the wind,

1:23:12.279 --> 1:23:16.409
or the wet crackle
of the electric rain.

1:23:16.492 --> 1:23:18.661
And at night, I turn the dial
of the wireless,

1:23:18.744 --> 1:23:21.330
hoping to catch clues
in the atmospheric electricity

1:23:21.414 --> 1:23:23.165
that comes from the afterlife.

1:23:23.249 --> 1:23:26.127
How to continue
with this crusade?

1:23:26.210 --> 1:23:29.171
For it was Emily
who first taught me

1:23:29.255 --> 1:23:31.048
the true nature of cats.

1:23:32.174 --> 1:23:33.801
The true value of cats.

1:23:33.884 --> 1:23:35.469
It is only
through understanding cats,

1:23:35.553 --> 1:23:37.304
how they are misunderstood
and mistreated,

1:23:37.388 --> 1:23:39.473
for no other reason
than simple blind prejudice,

1:23:39.557 --> 1:23:42.309
that I came to understand
human beings.

1:23:43.644 --> 1:23:46.856
How we are all corrupted
by a foul form of electricity.

1:23:46.939 --> 1:23:48.899
And it is only
through the work

1:23:48.983 --> 1:23:51.026
of those who have
the transformative gift

1:23:51.110 --> 1:23:53.654
that we can defeat it.

1:23:53.738 --> 1:23:57.324
Without change, we are
a fallen species with no future,

1:23:57.408 --> 1:24:00.745
an animal whose only instinct
is to destroy!

1:24:01.871 --> 1:24:03.622
[Caroline] Dear Louis.

1:24:03.706 --> 1:24:07.710
After a long and valiant
struggle with the influenza,

1:24:07.793 --> 1:24:11.005
our mother passed away
at 11:36 this morning.

1:24:11.088 --> 1:24:12.089
[knock on door]

1:24:13.507 --> 1:24:17.219
Even in her dying weeks,
she lived at her own rhythm,

1:24:17.303 --> 1:24:19.764
and regaled us
with stories about our father

1:24:19.847 --> 1:24:22.308
and their time together
as young lovers in London.

1:24:23.642 --> 1:24:27.271
She spoke of how dearly
she had missed you

1:24:27.354 --> 1:24:29.815
but understood
that you had gone on your trip

1:24:29.899 --> 1:24:32.485
for the good of the family.

1:24:32.568 --> 1:24:35.404
I hadn’t shared with her
the truth about our finances.

1:24:37.281 --> 1:24:40.326
But, Louis,
I’m writing to you now

1:24:40.409 --> 1:24:42.703
because I want you
to come home.

1:24:44.330 --> 1:24:46.290
I know we’ve had
our differences,

1:24:46.373 --> 1:24:48.000

1:24:48.083 --> 1:24:49.919
[thunder crashes]

1:24:50.002 --> 1:24:53.547
And you’ve been too far away
for too long.

1:24:53.631 --> 1:24:55.299
Meow. Ha, ha, ha.

1:24:55.382 --> 1:24:57.718
Your sister, Caroline.

1:24:57.802 --> 1:24:59.303
It’s funny. It’s funny.

1:25:04.183 --> 1:25:05.810

1:25:26.038 --> 1:25:28.082
Hello?

1:25:28.165 --> 1:25:30.626
Let me out!

1:25:30.709 --> 1:25:32.878
It’s not safe!

1:25:49.019 --> 1:25:51.939
Help! We’re... We’re sinking!
We’re sinking!

1:25:52.022 --> 1:25:54.149
Help me, please!

1:25:54.233 --> 1:25:59.238
Please, help me!
Help me! Help me!

1:25:59.321 --> 1:26:01.448
Please! Please!

1:26:01.532 --> 1:26:03.617
Mummy! Daddy!

1:26:03.701 --> 1:26:07.997
Help me! Help me! Help me!

1:26:08.080 --> 1:26:10.082
Help me!

1:26:22.511 --> 1:26:23.596
Just remember...

1:26:27.224 --> 1:26:29.226
[inaudible]

1:26:38.444 --> 1:26:40.112
Just remember...

1:26:41.113 --> 1:26:42.740
[Louis] Mummy!

1:26:44.241 --> 1:26:45.659
Daddy!

1:26:48.454 --> 1:26:52.499
Help me! Please!

1:26:54.168 --> 1:26:57.713
I’m drowning!

1:27:43.175 --> 1:27:45.260
[narrator]
You would be excused for hoping

1:27:45.344 --> 1:27:49.223
that this is where Mr Wain’s
fortunes would change.

1:27:49.306 --> 1:27:53.268
But, alas, a few years
after the death of his mother,

1:27:53.352 --> 1:27:57.189
poor Marie was also taken
by the dreaded influenza.

1:27:59.066 --> 1:28:01.694
While the creaking heart
of his friend and mentor,

1:28:01.777 --> 1:28:03.904
the generous
Sir William Ingram,

1:28:03.988 --> 1:28:06.448
finally gave in to his gout.

1:28:07.658 --> 1:28:09.535
Louis had continued
to display

1:28:09.618 --> 1:28:11.829
a woeful lack
of financial acumen,

1:28:11.912 --> 1:28:13.872
and the family sank
ever deeper

1:28:13.956 --> 1:28:15.916
in the quicksand
of their debts.

1:28:18.711 --> 1:28:20.754
[horn blares]

1:28:20.838 --> 1:28:23.257
And then,
when attempting one day

1:28:23.340 --> 1:28:25.300
to dismount
from a moving omnibus,

1:28:25.384 --> 1:28:28.637
he fell head first
into a profound coma

1:28:28.721 --> 1:28:32.307
and saw a vision
of the year 1999.

1:28:47.531 --> 1:28:50.534
To everyone’s surprise,
his lucky futurist cats

1:28:50.617 --> 1:28:52.369
were a great success

1:28:52.453 --> 1:28:55.581
and orders were made
all across Europe.

1:28:55.664 --> 1:28:57.166
But, at the same time,

1:28:57.249 --> 1:28:59.460
negative electricity
around the globe

1:28:59.543 --> 1:29:01.587
had risen to a critical level

1:29:01.670 --> 1:29:04.506
and military tensions
blistered into a state of war.

1:29:08.093 --> 1:29:10.763
He had worked tirelessly
for several months,

1:29:10.846 --> 1:29:13.265
but almost all of his cargo
was destroyed

1:29:13.348 --> 1:29:16.143
by a German U-boat
in the North Sea.

1:29:16.226 --> 1:29:18.145
[newsreader] A number
of British cargo ships

1:29:18.228 --> 1:29:20.147
have been sunk
by German submarines,

1:29:20.230 --> 1:29:22.191
leaving thousands of pounds
worth of merchandise

1:29:22.274 --> 1:29:24.818
to rest at the bottom
of the North Sea.

1:29:24.902 --> 1:29:26.945
Initial reports imply
that these vessels

1:29:27.029 --> 1:29:28.864
were caught in a crossfire...

1:29:39.374 --> 1:29:42.377

1:30:16.537 --> 1:30:19.373
[Caroline] Louis, sit down.

[sobbing]

1:30:39.101 --> 1:30:40.811
I want you to know that...

1:30:49.153 --> 1:30:51.738
I want you to know
that I’m very proud of you.

1:30:53.407 --> 1:30:55.993
[sobbing]

1:31:04.918 --> 1:31:07.546

1:31:17.014 --> 1:31:19.349
[Josephine] Enough!
Louis, enough!

1:31:19.433 --> 1:31:21.768
[sisters shouting]

1:31:22.477 --> 1:31:23.604

1:31:28.483 --> 1:31:30.402
Stop it, Louis, please!
Calm down!

1:31:30.485 --> 1:31:33.614
Louis! Louis!
Louis! Stop it!

1:31:36.658 --> 1:31:40.037
[Emily] Cats have been
worshipped as mystical gods

1:31:41.788 --> 1:31:45.375
and maligned as the evil allies
of witchery and sin.

1:31:47.794 --> 1:31:51.048
But I think you’re
the first person ever to see

1:31:51.131 --> 1:31:53.717
that they are
in fact ridiculous.

1:31:55.969 --> 1:31:58.722
They’re silly and cuddly.

1:32:00.140 --> 1:32:01.433
And lonely.

1:32:02.643 --> 1:32:04.728
Frightened and brave.

1:32:06.146 --> 1:32:07.731
Like us.

1:32:09.566 --> 1:32:12.611
[shouting continues]

1:32:15.447 --> 1:32:18.200
What’s going on in that
funny little head of yours?

1:33:28.854 --> 1:33:30.355
[Louis] Much better.

1:33:31.898 --> 1:33:33.984
You make the world beautiful.

1:33:35.569 --> 1:33:38.071
And warm. And kind.

1:33:39.740 --> 1:33:42.909
I just wanted to say thank you
for that before it’s too late.

1:33:45.620 --> 1:33:48.415
[Emily] I don’t make
the world beautiful, Louis.

1:33:51.251 --> 1:33:52.836
The world is beautiful.

1:33:55.589 --> 1:33:57.716
And you’ve helped me
to see that too.

1:34:04.181 --> 1:34:09.061
[woman] I’ll take you to
what we call the paupers’ ward.

1:34:09.144 --> 1:34:13.065
For, um... Well,
for obvious reasons.

1:34:13.148 --> 1:34:16.068
I assure you, the patients
are taken care of

1:34:16.151 --> 1:34:18.153
in a perfectly
professional manner.

1:34:18.236 --> 1:34:19.738
1925

1:34:19.821 --> 1:34:23.033
I hope you will report
favourably

1:34:23.116 --> 1:34:25.327
back to the committee
you volunteer for?

1:34:25.410 --> 1:34:28.538
I’m here to assess the welfare
of your patients, Dr Cooke,

1:34:28.622 --> 1:34:30.290
and the running
of your hospital.

1:34:30.374 --> 1:34:32.834
Not just on behalf
of my fellow committee members

1:34:32.918 --> 1:34:34.836
but on behalf
of the government.

1:34:34.920 --> 1:34:37.672
So I shall report back

1:34:37.756 --> 1:34:41.009
-according to what I find.
-Indeed.

1:34:41.093 --> 1:34:44.054
What is the average length
of stay here at Springfield?

1:34:44.137 --> 1:34:48.183
Have you had much success
with turning patients out?

1:34:48.266 --> 1:34:50.310
We have had some successes.

1:34:50.394 --> 1:34:52.687
But it depends partly
on the patient’s willingness

1:34:52.771 --> 1:34:54.398
to cooperate.

1:34:54.481 --> 1:34:56.900
And as you can imagine,
Mr Rider,

1:34:56.983 --> 1:34:59.778
that varies widely
from person to person.

1:35:01.488 --> 1:35:03.156
[Rider] Louis Wain.

1:35:03.240 --> 1:35:07.911
Yes. This is Mr Louis Wain.

1:35:09.287 --> 1:35:12.582
You might remember his rather
charming cat pictures

1:35:12.666 --> 1:35:15.502
from all those years ago.

1:35:18.171 --> 1:35:19.923
How are you, Mr Wain?

1:35:24.177 --> 1:35:26.972
It’s, uh... It’s me.

1:35:29.099 --> 1:35:32.602
Dan Rider. We met on the train
back from Andover.

1:35:32.686 --> 1:35:36.982
I had my...
my sister’s Pomeranian with me.

1:35:38.150 --> 1:35:39.443
Cleopatra.

1:35:41.945 --> 1:35:43.321
Cleopatra?

1:35:43.405 --> 1:35:44.489
Yes.

1:35:52.998 --> 1:35:55.167
I’d no idea you were
a patient here, Mr Wain.

1:35:55.250 --> 1:35:57.586
He is, I’m afraid,
quite insane.

1:35:57.669 --> 1:36:00.464
Uh, but we do our best
to look after him.

1:36:01.715 --> 1:36:05.051
Very sad, isn’t it, Mr Rider?

1:36:05.135 --> 1:36:07.137
He seems almost entirely

1:36:07.220 --> 1:36:09.222
to have lost a handle
on his craft.

1:36:16.354 --> 1:36:18.190
Do you like it here, Mr Wain?

1:36:21.693 --> 1:36:23.361
There are no cats.

1:36:25.780 --> 1:36:29.409
I cannot see... outside.

1:36:32.454 --> 1:36:35.290
Oh. That must be
rather difficult

1:36:35.373 --> 1:36:38.168
for someone like you,
Mr Wain,

1:36:38.251 --> 1:36:41.463
who’s spent his entire life
examining the world,

1:36:41.546 --> 1:36:45.300
suddenly not to see it.

1:36:53.558 --> 1:36:54.809
[sighs]

1:36:58.104 --> 1:36:59.898
[whimpers]

1:37:05.070 --> 1:37:06.446
[Louis moans]

1:37:10.742 --> 1:37:12.911
I have failed.

1:37:16.331 --> 1:37:17.499
I’ve...

1:37:19.751 --> 1:37:24.589
I have failed her, Mr Rider.

1:37:26.132 --> 1:37:28.343
I don’t think you have failed,
Mr Wain...

1:37:29.302 --> 1:37:31.054
from what you have been saying.

1:37:36.226 --> 1:37:38.979
Why do you think
Emily wanted you

1:37:39.062 --> 1:37:41.356
to keep painting pictures,
Mr Wain?

1:37:44.150 --> 1:37:46.152
To help people.

1:37:48.738 --> 1:37:50.240
To show them.

1:37:51.032 --> 1:37:52.993
Perhaps.

1:37:53.076 --> 1:37:55.287
And there’s no doubt
that you’ve done that.

1:37:56.538 --> 1:37:59.374
But I have a rather
different theory.

1:38:04.504 --> 1:38:08.341
I think she wanted you
to keep painting

1:38:11.011 --> 1:38:12.846
so you would not be alone.

1:38:22.564 --> 1:38:27.569
When you paint, Mr Wain,
you connect with other people

1:38:27.652 --> 1:38:30.322
and you give them
a piece of yourself,

1:38:30.405 --> 1:38:35.702
but... they are also
connecting with you.

1:38:38.288 --> 1:38:42.250
And that electricity
that you describe...

1:38:45.420 --> 1:38:47.714
that you felt
in the presence of Emily,

1:38:49.341 --> 1:38:51.509
I’d call that love, Mr Wain.

1:38:57.140 --> 1:38:58.850
And that is still here.

1:39:16.076 --> 1:39:18.286
[narrator] With the help
of the Wain sisters,

1:39:18.370 --> 1:39:21.081
the plucky Mr Rider
decided to start a fund

1:39:21.164 --> 1:39:22.791
in support of Louis

1:39:22.874 --> 1:39:24.834
and to raise enough money
to move him

1:39:24.918 --> 1:39:27.504
to a much more comfortable
hospital in the countryside,

1:39:27.587 --> 1:39:29.339
where they allowed
their patients

1:39:29.422 --> 1:39:31.132
to keep cats for comfort.

1:39:32.300 --> 1:39:34.302
They were joined
by Wain enthusiasts

1:39:34.386 --> 1:39:35.845
up and down the country

1:39:35.929 --> 1:39:37.639
and even received the help

1:39:37.722 --> 1:39:39.724
of some more influential fans,

1:39:39.808 --> 1:39:42.519
like the renowned
author HG Wells,

1:39:42.602 --> 1:39:44.437
who made a national plea

1:39:44.521 --> 1:39:46.856
on behalf
of the Louis Wain fund.

1:39:46.940 --> 1:39:51.111
[HG Wells] The artist Louis Wain
made the cat his own.

1:39:51.194 --> 1:39:54.030
He invented a cat style.

1:39:54.114 --> 1:39:56.074
A cat society.

1:39:56.157 --> 1:39:59.452
A whole cat world.

1:39:59.536 --> 1:40:03.123
Cats that do not look and live
like Louis Wain cats

1:40:03.206 --> 1:40:05.542
are ashamed of themselves.

1:40:05.625 --> 1:40:07.168
But now,

1:40:08.628 --> 1:40:12.132
as he approaches
the end of his own life,

1:40:12.215 --> 1:40:16.052
Mr Wain and his sisters
desperately require

1:40:16.136 --> 1:40:18.638
the most generous help
of cat lovers

1:40:18.722 --> 1:40:21.683
and right-thinking
people everywhere.

1:40:21.766 --> 1:40:26.187
CONTRIBUTE TO THE
LOUIS WAIN FUND

1:40:27.147 --> 1:40:29.107
[narrator] For Louis Wain,

1:40:29.190 --> 1:40:31.735
electricity was not just
something that we use

1:40:31.818 --> 1:40:35.405
to make toast or to power
a bulb in the bathroom.

1:40:35.488 --> 1:40:37.323
It was something bigger,

1:40:37.407 --> 1:40:39.826
something so extraordinary
and strange

1:40:39.909 --> 1:40:43.329
that the human mind was barely
able even to comprehend it.

1:40:44.664 --> 1:40:48.293
A mysterious elemental force
that on occasion,

1:40:48.376 --> 1:40:51.379
he could feel shimmering
in the ether,

1:40:51.463 --> 1:40:54.174
and the key to all
of life’s most profound

1:40:54.257 --> 1:40:56.259
and alarming secrets.

1:44:11.037 --> 1:44:12.372
Look.
