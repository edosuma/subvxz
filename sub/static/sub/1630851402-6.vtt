42:09.360 --> 42:12.000
Do you have children?
Yeah.

42:15.200 --> 42:17.400
No.

42:17.400 --> 42:20.960
No. I did have.

42:22.320 --> 42:24.000
I had a son.

42:28.120 --> 42:30.800
He found this world
a really tough place.

42:32.320 --> 42:34.600
And I wasn't there to...

42:38.640 --> 42:40.800
16...16 years old.

43:01.160 --> 43:05.360
I've been talking to Barney, said
you'd been a bit quiet of late.

43:05.360 --> 43:07.280
We're Facebook friends now.

43:10.440 --> 43:12.080
Just the usual stuff.

43:13.280 --> 43:15.000
Not about...

43:16.760 --> 43:18.440
Yeah.

43:30.440 --> 43:32.760

43:33.880 --> 43:35.720

It's so fucked up.
Yeah. I know.

43:57.360 --> 43:59.360
I've had shit happen.

43:59.360 --> 44:00.760
And you know what?

44:00.760 --> 44:05.280
I felt sorry for myself
and angry with people too.

44:06.520 --> 44:09.760
But it's just made me angrier

44:09.760 --> 44:11.080
and sadder.

44:11.080 --> 44:13.960
And I've decided
I don't want that anymore.

44:16.560 --> 44:20.120
Hey? Reach out, Jai.

44:21.320 --> 44:23.160
Talk to Barney.

44:26.160 --> 44:28.360
You are not alone in this.

44:29.760 --> 44:31.280
