00:05.373 --> 00:08.407
(panting)

00:09.377 --> 00:10.709
Talk to me, Spike.

00:10.711 --> 00:14.279
Subject's vehicle is
a red Nebraska mid-'90s.

00:14.281 --> 00:16.348
Vehicle approaching.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.183
South-southwest from you.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.552
Is it our red Nebraska?

00:20.554 --> 00:23.489
Stop! Stop!

00:23.491 --> 00:26.592
Oh, my God, no!

00:30.197 --> 00:31.463
Help!

00:50.151 --> 00:51.550
Mmm!

00:51.552 --> 00:53.385
Wow, nice!

00:53.387 --> 00:55.454
That is delicious.
What's in this?

00:55.456 --> 00:58.290
Goat cheese and pancetta
in a puff pastry.

00:58.292 --> 01:00.259
Mmm.
You like it?

01:00.261 --> 01:02.127
Please tell me you're
adding these to the menu.

01:02.129 --> 01:04.129
Boss doesn't even know she
does these little experiments.

01:04.131 --> 01:05.497
Only on the graveyard shift.

01:05.499 --> 01:08.500
I had to come up with an
original appetizer for school.

01:08.502 --> 01:10.702
She's gonna move on
to bigger and better things

01:10.704 --> 01:12.204
and leave me here all alone.

01:12.206 --> 01:13.272
Don't worry about it.

01:13.274 --> 01:14.506
Once I get my own restaurant,

01:14.508 --> 01:18.210
you can come
and work for me.
Nice.

01:18.212 --> 01:20.312
Morning.

01:20.314 --> 01:22.448
Hi.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.216
Uh, coffee, two creams?

01:32.560 --> 01:34.793
Thought something might
be wrong with your phone.

01:34.795 --> 01:38.363
Oh, no, it's working.

01:38.365 --> 01:40.799
Jeff...

01:46.640 --> 01:49.108
Look, this isn't the place.

01:49.110 --> 01:50.876
Well, then name the place,
and I'll be there.

01:50.878 --> 01:52.411
'Cause if it's not in here,

01:52.413 --> 01:54.346
I'm not supposed to go
to your place anymore.

01:54.348 --> 01:55.814
You don't answer your phone.
I'm sorry.

01:55.816 --> 01:58.650
It's just...
there's nothing left to say.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.252
I'm sorry.

02:00.254 --> 02:03.455
Please... I'm the one
who's sorry.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.757
Please.

02:05.759 --> 02:08.427
I think you should go.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.661
Zoe...

02:11.398 --> 02:15.200
Please.

02:15.202 --> 02:16.869
No.

02:18.339 --> 02:20.506
Jeff, this is a no.

02:24.411 --> 02:25.811
Don't.
You think you can
do better than me?

02:25.813 --> 02:28.280
Don't...
Have you looked in
the mirror lately?

02:28.282 --> 02:29.515
You need to go now.

02:29.516 --> 02:30.749
Eh? Look at you!
Ouch!

02:30.751 --> 02:31.750
Hey, leave her alone!

02:31.752 --> 02:32.918
Ow!
I'm gonna dial

02:32.920 --> 02:34.319
911 right now,
you son of a bitch.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.321
You let her go.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.658
We are not done.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.860
We're<i> not</i> done.

02:47.168 --> 02:49.234
Zoe...

02:55.442 --> 02:56.608
Alison, what are you doing?

02:56.610 --> 02:59.344
That was an assault.
He crossed the line.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.413
I'm walking you home.
No, I'm gonna
finish my shift.

03:01.415 --> 03:02.714
You've only got
15 minutes left, honey.

03:02.716 --> 03:03.882
I'm finishing my shift

03:03.884 --> 03:05.284
'cause I'm not gonna let him

03:05.286 --> 03:07.452
change how I live my life.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.824
Excuse me.

03:15.296 --> 03:17.362
Dale, how about a warmup?

03:21.435 --> 03:24.403
It's okay.

03:24.405 --> 03:25.871
I'm gonna get going.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.606
Thanks.

03:48.596 --> 03:51.597
Spike, ready?

03:51.599 --> 03:53.599
Sure.

04:49.556 --> 04:51.490
Hey, Zoe.
Hey, Rachel.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.625
Hey, Archie.

05:24.591 --> 05:25.824
(knocking)

05:38.505 --> 05:40.972
Hey. (whistling)

05:40.974 --> 05:42.574
Come here.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.343
ZOE:
Stay away from me!

05:44.345 --> 05:46.511
No, no!
(barking)

05:46.513 --> 05:47.979
Archie...
Zoe, please!

05:47.981 --> 05:50.082
Listen to me.
You have to understand!

05:50.084 --> 05:52.351
(items breaking)
I told you... !

05:52.353 --> 05:55.354
Get your hands off of me!
Please, don't make me do this!

05:55.356 --> 05:56.722
Zoe, please!
Get away from me!

05:56.724 --> 05:57.856
(screaming)
(whimpering)

05:57.858 --> 05:59.391
Um, someone's having a fight

05:59.393 --> 06:01.026
with my neighbor,
and I think she's being...

06:01.028 --> 06:03.128
(gunshot, dog barking)

06:03.130 --> 06:04.663
Someone shot her!

06:04.665 --> 06:05.731
(barking)

06:05.733 --> 06:06.865
How you doing?

06:06.867 --> 06:08.467
A little better every day.

06:08.469 --> 06:09.801
Yeah, I hear you.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.672
Good morning, Team 1.
Morning.

06:16.110 --> 06:18.076
Barring any calls,
it's gonna be a light day.

06:18.078 --> 06:20.145
No warrants
until this afternoon

06:20.147 --> 06:21.646
so I'm thinking
we're gonna patrol.

06:21.648 --> 06:23.582
Are you okay
with that, Eddie?

06:23.584 --> 06:25.650
Yep, yep, good with that.

06:25.652 --> 06:26.752
Good.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.086
Leah Kerns, first day.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.855
Welcome.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.590
We're gonna take it
easy today.

06:31.592 --> 06:32.924
And, uh, I'm sure
you remember everyone

06:32.926 --> 06:36.661
from the recruiting trials

06:36.663 --> 06:39.398
so, I won't, uh, embarrass you
with any speeches.

06:39.400 --> 06:40.499
Can I say something?

06:44.538 --> 06:45.804
Floor's yours.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.775
Thank you for choosing me.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.643
I know why I'm here.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.745
You're down a guy
and I'm replacing him.

06:56.483 --> 06:58.517
Don't hate me for it.

06:58.519 --> 07:01.686
Firefighting unit I served with,
we lost one of ours,

07:01.688 --> 07:03.054
so, I know what that's like.

07:05.058 --> 07:05.924
If you wanna talk about it...

07:05.926 --> 07:07.626
We're good.

07:07.628 --> 07:10.629
Team 1, suit up. Suit up.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.764
Shots fired.
Let's go!

07:12.766 --> 07:15.967
(alarm blaring)

07:15.969 --> 07:17.202
Time and a place.

07:17.204 --> 07:20.939
(alarm blaring)

07:23.944 --> 07:28.480
We have gunshot reports
at 8112 Wolf Trail Crescent.

07:28.482 --> 07:30.782
How long since
the shot was fired?

07:30.784 --> 07:32.284
15 minutes.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.785
Pretty sure we have a
hostage situation in there.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.620
Any of your officers
try to make contact?

07:35.622 --> 07:37.122
No, told my guys
to maintain

07:37.123 --> 07:38.623
a hard perimeter and
wait for the cavalry.

07:38.625 --> 07:39.858
Thank you.

07:41.728 --> 07:44.696
Okay, boss, the neighbor reports
hearing sounds of an argument

07:44.698 --> 07:46.998
between Zoe and an
unidentified male.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.166
An argument with who?

07:48.168 --> 07:49.568
She have a roommate?
Lives alone.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.236
No, but she does
have a boyfriend.

07:51.237 --> 07:52.903
It's not the first time the
neighbor's heard them arguing.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.739
Yeah, but this time
it got physical.

07:54.741 --> 07:56.942
All right, guys,
I've sketched a floor plan

07:56.944 --> 07:58.777
based on the neighbor's
description.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.679
White wall, one window.

08:00.681 --> 08:03.915
Black wall, door.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.817
Sam, Wordy and I: Alpha Team.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.519
Where do you want me?

08:07.521 --> 08:08.787
Bravo Team with Spike.

08:08.789 --> 08:11.156
Stand sentry black wall exit.
Copy.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.658
Jules.
Sarge?

08:13.660 --> 08:15.827
Get me anything
you can on Zoe Granger,

08:15.829 --> 08:17.996
who her boyfriend is, and
anything that can help, okay?

08:17.998 --> 08:19.631
Yep.
Just feed me on the fly.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.900
Got it.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.939
Winnie, I need a phone number
for Zoe Granger.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.908
Copy that.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.719
JULES:
<i> 7:12 a.m.:</i>

08:40.721 --> 08:42.387
SRU arrive on scene.

08:42.388 --> 08:44.054
Shot fired.
Possible barricaded domestic.

08:54.735 --> 08:57.035
They're not picking up.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.637
Go in aggressive.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.606
Hit it. Hit it.

09:01.608 --> 09:03.542
Police!
Strategic Response Unit!

09:03.544 --> 09:06.044
Police! Get down!

09:06.046 --> 09:07.879
Bedroom clear.
Kitchen clear.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.281
Sam.

09:10.951 --> 09:11.950
Back door.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.752
Go!

09:13.754 --> 09:16.821
(water running)

09:18.892 --> 09:20.559
Boss, they're gone.

09:20.561 --> 09:24.262
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

09:53.660 --> 09:55.727
We've checked.
No sign of them, boss.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.262
Okay, new deal.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.663
Jules, call it.

09:58.665 --> 10:01.600
7:21 a.m.: armed abduction.

10:01.602 --> 10:02.801
All right,
let's read the scene fast.

10:02.803 --> 10:03.919
Time's against us.

10:03.920 --> 10:05.036
Spike, need you
in the truck for intel.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.338
Jules, the witness.

10:06.340 --> 10:08.273
Priority is the
boyfriend's name, a vehicle,

10:08.275 --> 10:09.274
a destination,
anything.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.275
LEAH:
Greg?

10:10.277 --> 10:12.110
Yeah, Leah?

10:12.112 --> 10:13.712
What do you want me to do?

10:13.714 --> 10:15.213
Profile with, uh, Jules, Leah.

10:15.215 --> 10:16.982
Copy.
Word to the wise:

10:16.984 --> 10:18.717
we call him "boss."

10:22.255 --> 10:23.622
(barking)

10:23.624 --> 10:25.724
So, do you know his name?
No.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.892
I don't even know her that well.

10:27.894 --> 10:30.128
Ah, uh, after the gunshot,

10:30.130 --> 10:31.830
did you see anything?
Did you hear a car take off?

10:31.832 --> 10:33.615
Oh, totally.

10:33.616 --> 10:35.399
Um, a few minutes after the shot
I looked out my window

10:35.402 --> 10:38.103
and I saw this car come
tearing out of the parking lot.

10:38.105 --> 10:40.338
Great. Did you manage
to get a plate number?

10:40.340 --> 10:41.840
No, it moved too fast.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.108
Can you describe the vehicle?

10:43.110 --> 10:46.678
I don't know.
Four doors, uh, kinda old?

10:46.680 --> 10:48.013
You have to be a little bit
more descriptive than that.

10:48.015 --> 10:49.147
You know, my grandfather--
(barking)

10:49.148 --> 10:50.280
he used to drive
the exact same car.
Okay, okay.

10:50.283 --> 10:51.833
Kind of smelled inside,

10:51.834 --> 10:53.384
'cause my brother...
Do you remember the color?

10:53.387 --> 10:54.719
Reddish.
Reddish,

10:54.721 --> 10:56.388
okay, so, you don't
know what make?

10:56.390 --> 10:58.323
Okay, I don't know cars.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.858
Well, I have
a friend who dies.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.693
so you're gonna come
with us right now.

11:01.695 --> 11:02.894
(barks)

11:02.896 --> 11:04.996
He's gonna stay,
though, okay?

11:04.998 --> 11:06.798
Stay, Archie.
(whines)

11:09.436 --> 11:11.836
Okay, boss, no signs
of forced entry here

11:11.838 --> 11:13.705
except our handiwork.

11:13.707 --> 11:16.708
So either she was okay
with inviting him in...

11:16.710 --> 11:18.176
...or she was okay

11:18.178 --> 11:21.179
with not being shot when
he's waving a gun in her face.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.265
What do you got, Sam?

11:23.266 --> 11:25.350
Small caliber casing: .380 ACP.
This matches

11:25.352 --> 11:27.786
the box of ammo
Wordy found in the bedroom.

11:27.788 --> 11:30.121
So, the gun was hers.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.423
(typing, computer trills)

11:31.425 --> 11:32.791
No.

11:33.694 --> 11:34.693
No.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.728
(computer trills)

11:36.730 --> 11:37.796
Wait.

11:39.266 --> 11:40.699
No.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.818
Rachel, assuming
the subject's vehicle

11:42.819 --> 11:44.936
is speeding away as we speak,
time is kinda important here.

11:44.938 --> 11:47.739
Okay, well, I guess
it sorta had

11:47.741 --> 11:50.475
these long, stretched-out
cat eyes?

11:50.477 --> 11:51.476
SPIKE:
Cat eyes?

11:51.478 --> 11:53.378
Yeah. Sorry.

11:53.380 --> 11:57.382
No, no, cat eyes, cat eyes.
I can, I can work with cat eyes.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.817
(typing)

12:01.722 --> 12:03.572
She's in chef school.

12:03.573 --> 12:05.423
There's nothing here.
Nothing to go on, no photos.

12:05.425 --> 12:06.908
Actually, there is.

12:06.909 --> 12:08.392
No photos means no family.
Isolated, maybe estranged.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.928
Right.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.863
That's why she's with
the badass boyfriend.

12:11.865 --> 12:13.765
Perceptive.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.066
Been there.

12:17.971 --> 12:19.504
Hey.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.773
Pay stub.

12:21.775 --> 12:24.976
Nice. We got a workplace.

12:24.978 --> 12:26.911
PARKER:
That's great.
Check it out, Jules.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.980
Boss, I'm thinking she kept
a handgun just in case.

12:28.982 --> 12:30.448
Let him in,
hoping not to use it.

12:30.450 --> 12:33.818
Yeah, things go south, she goes
for the gun in her bag...

12:33.820 --> 12:36.187
Maybe there's a struggle
over it, it goes off...

12:36.189 --> 12:37.455
And misses.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.023
There's no blood.
So that's a positive.

12:39.025 --> 12:40.759
SPIKE:
Boss, I got something.

12:40.761 --> 12:41.793
Go ahead.

12:41.795 --> 12:42.794
Subject's vehicle

12:42.796 --> 12:44.796
is a red Nebraska, mid-'90s.

12:44.798 --> 12:47.899
Let's put an APB out on the car.
One male, one female passenger.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.467
This is an armed abduction.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.503
If they're spotted,
do not engage. SRU only.

12:51.505 --> 12:55.240
Copy. I'm gonna patch into
the red-light traffic cams, too.

12:55.242 --> 12:57.209
Oh, my God.
Is she all right?

12:57.210 --> 12:59.177
JULES:
We don't know yet. We think
that she's been abducted.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.178
It's gotta be Jeff.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.780
Is that her boyfriend?

13:01.782 --> 13:03.248
Jeff Stuckley.
He was in here this morning.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.633
They had a fight.

13:04.634 --> 13:06.017
Do you know where he lives?
No. Uh,

13:06.019 --> 13:07.669
Leslieville somewhere.

13:07.670 --> 13:09.320
Spike, Jeff Stuckley,
Leslieville address.

13:09.322 --> 13:10.355
Copy.

13:10.357 --> 13:11.523
So, he's her boyfriend?

13:11.525 --> 13:14.025
ALISON:
Ex. Only he doesn't think so.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.460
She keeps trying
to break up with him.

13:15.462 --> 13:16.795
He keeps trying
to make up with her,

13:16.797 --> 13:18.363
but this morning it didn't work.

13:18.365 --> 13:20.431
Has he been violent with her?
Made any threats?

13:20.433 --> 13:22.467
Yeah, I mean,
he's rough with her.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.468
He's always putting her down.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.003
Why would she stay with him?

13:25.005 --> 13:28.840
"I need you, baby."
Uh, "All we have is each other."

13:28.842 --> 13:30.275
And she fell for it every time.

13:30.277 --> 13:31.810
It's like she couldn't think
straight.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.945
Jeffrey is what we call
"known to the police."

13:33.947 --> 13:35.947
Break and enter,
aggravated assault.

13:35.949 --> 13:38.583
Does he have a registered
Nebraska by any chance?

13:38.585 --> 13:40.885
No, but carjacking seems well
within his skill set.

13:40.887 --> 13:42.320
Has she reported him

13:42.322 --> 13:43.855
for assault?

13:43.857 --> 13:45.123
No. She's crazy loyal.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.826
She's... a really great girl.

13:47.828 --> 13:51.129
Please, make sure
nothing happens to her.

13:51.131 --> 13:54.132
We're gonna do everything we can
to bring her home.

13:54.134 --> 13:56.034
(computer trilling)

13:56.036 --> 13:57.836
I got a home address.

13:58.839 --> 14:01.606
Okay, team, we're on the move.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.508
(sirens blaring)

14:06.379 --> 14:08.146
Well, you could, but that
wouldn't be very smart.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.881
'Cause I don't know where else
you're gonna get...

14:09.883 --> 14:12.483
SRU! Everybody freeze!

14:13.486 --> 14:14.586
(grunts, groans)

14:14.588 --> 14:16.888
8:14 a.m.:
subject contained.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.389
Jeff Stuckley, where's Zoe?

14:18.391 --> 14:19.891
I don't know!
Where's Zoe?!

14:19.893 --> 14:20.892
I don't know!

14:20.894 --> 14:22.260
Where's Zoe?!
I don't know!

14:26.633 --> 14:27.599
Where is she, Jeff?

14:27.601 --> 14:29.133
Zoe Granger.

14:29.135 --> 14:30.168
I don't know.

14:30.170 --> 14:31.603
You sure about that?

14:31.605 --> 14:34.372
A gun was discharged
at her apartment this morning.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.307
She's missing. You are
a person of interest.

14:36.309 --> 14:37.542
What?!

14:37.544 --> 14:38.910
SAM:
That's what
we're asking you.

14:38.912 --> 14:42.113
Where were you
an hour ago?
I was here.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.348
She's my girlfriend, man.

14:43.350 --> 14:44.883
What do you think
I'm gonna do?

14:44.885 --> 14:46.651
Girlfriend?
We heard Zoe broke up with you.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.152
You were taking it pretty hard.

14:48.154 --> 14:49.587
Screw you.

14:49.589 --> 14:52.323
Where'd you go when you
left the donut shop, Jeff?

14:52.325 --> 14:53.958
PARKER:
That's a beautiful
menorah.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.111
You Jewish, Jeff?

14:56.112 --> 14:58.263
Spike, you feel like running
some insurance numbers?

14:58.265 --> 15:01.032
I don't know
where she is, okay?
"573..."

15:01.034 --> 15:02.901
You know who you should be
looking at?

15:02.903 --> 15:04.669
I'll tell you who
you should be looking at.

15:04.671 --> 15:05.570
Yeah?
Yeah, I'm serious, man.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.088
<i> There's this weird guy.</i>

15:07.089 --> 15:08.605
<i> He hangs out</i>
<i> at the donut shop 24/7.</i>

15:08.608 --> 15:11.342
<i> His name's Dale.</i>
<i> He's obsessed with Zoe.</i>

15:11.344 --> 15:14.178
<i> Got a real thing for her.</i>

15:14.180 --> 15:15.380
(bell above door rings)

15:15.382 --> 15:16.531
Excuse me.

15:16.532 --> 15:17.681
I don't like the way
you talk to Zoe.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.584
Look, man, I've seen the way
you look at her.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.119
She's half your age.

15:21.588 --> 15:22.921
Want to dance, old man?

15:22.923 --> 15:25.990
Don't you dare touch her again.

15:25.992 --> 15:28.026
She deserves better than you.

15:33.199 --> 15:34.532
I'm telling you.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.200
There's something off
in the head with that guy.

15:36.202 --> 15:38.403
Boss, the insurance numbers
match items stolen

15:38.405 --> 15:39.470
from a pawn shop

15:39.472 --> 15:40.638
early this morning.

15:40.640 --> 15:41.973
JEFF:
Must be a mistake.

15:41.975 --> 15:43.141
You interrupting my friend?

15:45.211 --> 15:46.444
Go ahead.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.579
The alarm was tripped at 7:05.
He's in the clear.

15:48.581 --> 15:51.249
He didn't take Zoe.
The good news here, Jeff,

15:51.251 --> 15:53.351
is that we still get
to arrest you for robbery.

15:53.353 --> 15:54.719
What?
Can't prove I did it.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.254
You were caught on the
video surveillance camera.

15:56.256 --> 15:57.255
Officer Wordsworth?

15:57.257 --> 15:59.407
Be my pleasure.

15:59.408 --> 16:01.558
Look, when you find her, can you
give her a message for me?

16:01.561 --> 16:03.161
Nope. Keep walking, Jeff.

16:03.163 --> 16:04.629
All right, new deal.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.297
He's gotta be talking
about Dale.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.999
He's in here all the time.

16:08.001 --> 16:09.167
So, was he there this morning?

16:09.169 --> 16:10.168
He's in here every time
Zoe's working.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.237
He knows her schedule.

16:12.238 --> 16:14.305
Look, any gal that works
in a coffee shop like this

16:14.307 --> 16:15.540
has a regular like Dale,

16:15.542 --> 16:17.709
a guy that, you know,
takes a shine to her.

16:17.711 --> 16:19.310
So he has a thing for Zoe.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.378
In a sweet way.

16:20.380 --> 16:21.980
I think he's just a lonely guy.

16:21.982 --> 16:23.414
A little intense maybe.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.416
Intense...
SPIKE:
You know Dale's
last name?

16:25.418 --> 16:26.417
He never mentioned it.

16:26.419 --> 16:27.485
You see him a lot.

16:27.487 --> 16:28.987
What do you know about him?

16:28.989 --> 16:30.688
He doesn't talk about himself
very much.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.023
PARKER:
What's he talk about?

16:32.025 --> 16:33.258
Zoe.

16:33.259 --> 16:34.492
Does he ever pay
with credit card?

16:34.494 --> 16:35.493
Always cash.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.295
What kind of car does he drive?

16:37.297 --> 16:38.563
I guess he parks around back.

16:38.565 --> 16:39.530
I've never seen his car.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.099
All right, thanks, Alison.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.667
Spike, how many old-model
red Nebraskas

16:42.669 --> 16:44.302
we got in the city?

16:44.304 --> 16:45.336
(typing)

16:45.338 --> 16:47.338
Over 200.
First name Dale?

16:47.340 --> 16:50.041
All right, there's a Dale
Mezzatesta in Parkdale...

16:50.043 --> 16:52.677
Dale Phyllis Mezzatesta--
that's a woman.

16:52.679 --> 16:55.046
Too young. Too far. Too young.
Dale Murray.

16:55.048 --> 16:56.314
He's 51.

16:56.316 --> 16:57.448
Okay, that's our guy.

16:57.450 --> 16:58.516
26 Coyle Street.

16:58.518 --> 16:59.751
RACHEL:
Right near the coffee shop.

16:59.753 --> 17:01.419
PARKER:
Okay, feed us info
on Dale.

17:04.290 --> 17:06.190
Okay.

17:06.191 --> 17:08.091
SPIKE:
<i> Dale Murray:</i>
<i> Self-employed contractor.</i>

17:08.094 --> 17:11.262
Hold on. He's flagged.
Doesn't say why.

17:11.264 --> 17:13.231
Let me see
if there's a file on him.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.571
(doorbell rings)

17:22.642 --> 17:24.042
Mrs. Murray?

17:24.044 --> 17:25.610
Yes?
Hi, I'm Sergeant
Greg Parker.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.779
We're with the police
Strategic Response Unit.

17:27.781 --> 17:29.213
Is your husband at home?

17:29.215 --> 17:30.498
My ex-husband.

17:30.499 --> 17:31.782
No. He hasn't lived here
in over a year.

17:31.785 --> 17:35.286
Ma'am, with your permission,
we'd like to come in

17:35.288 --> 17:36.487
and verify that
for ourselves.

17:36.489 --> 17:37.722
Of course. Go ahead.

17:57.610 --> 18:00.111
They've got a daughter.

18:00.113 --> 18:01.379
It's musty.

18:01.380 --> 18:02.646
Nobody's been in here
in a while.

18:02.649 --> 18:05.316
Maybe she moved out.

18:11.357 --> 18:12.457
Sam...

18:12.459 --> 18:14.125
check it out.

18:14.127 --> 18:17.528
Whoa.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.630
Guys...

18:19.632 --> 18:22.266
you gotta see this.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.368
(device trilling)

18:24.370 --> 18:26.771
Hmm.

18:26.773 --> 18:29.207
More than just
a passing resemblance.

18:31.111 --> 18:35.146
Mrs. Murray,
do you have a daughter?

18:35.148 --> 18:36.547
I did.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.683
I'm sorry?

18:38.685 --> 18:40.218
Isn't that why you're here?

18:40.220 --> 18:43.387
Because you think
Dale killed our daughter?

19:00.773 --> 19:02.540
Okay.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.609
Let's get you out of there.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.280
Give me your hand.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.415
Watch your head.

19:11.417 --> 19:12.550
Dale, what's happening?

19:12.552 --> 19:14.152
Where are we?

19:14.154 --> 19:17.889
Never mind that.
Come on.

19:17.891 --> 19:19.290
Why are we here?

19:19.292 --> 19:20.925
Come on.

19:20.927 --> 19:23.494
Dale, people are gonna
be looking for me!

19:23.496 --> 19:25.463
They will never
find you here.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.533
Come on.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.536
Come on.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.671
SPIKE:
<i> Married for 19 years </i>
<i> to Judith.</i>

19:33.673 --> 19:37.341
I got an open file on Wendy
Murray, Dale's daughter.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.510
She went missing
when she was 18 years old.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.279
Yeah, go on.

19:41.281 --> 19:44.215
She was going back to college
on a bus, but she never arrived.

19:44.217 --> 19:46.617
No sign that she was making
plans to run away.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.086
Suspects?

19:48.087 --> 19:49.554
Nothing solid.
But I can tell you

19:49.556 --> 19:51.355
who was a person of interest.

19:51.357 --> 19:52.490
Let me guess...

19:52.492 --> 19:53.658
Dale Murray.

19:58.798 --> 20:01.332
Mrs. Murray,

20:01.334 --> 20:03.568
we're here because we believe
your ex-husband has abducted

20:03.570 --> 20:05.203
a young woman
named Zoe Granger

20:05.205 --> 20:07.572
two hours ago.

20:07.574 --> 20:09.840
That's Zoe Granger.
Do you recognize her?

20:09.842 --> 20:10.841
No.

20:10.843 --> 20:11.976
She was abducted

20:11.978 --> 20:13.477
violently; there was a gunshot.

20:13.479 --> 20:16.514
Ma'am, if you know anything...

20:16.516 --> 20:18.516
There's a trailer
just west of the city.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.284
That's where he lives now.

20:20.286 --> 20:21.452
Guys, we got a location.

20:21.454 --> 20:22.937
ED:
Copy that.

20:22.938 --> 20:24.421
The police thought
it might be Dale.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.007
He was the last one

20:26.008 --> 20:27.591
to see Wendy.
He drove her to
the bus station

20:27.594 --> 20:30.761
so she could go back to college,
but she never got there.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.230
Hold on one second.

20:32.232 --> 20:33.331
Where to?

20:33.333 --> 20:34.765
Start heading west.
I'm gonna stay here.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.601
I'll feed you directions
on the fly.

20:36.603 --> 20:38.903
Just go.
Copy that.

20:40.406 --> 20:41.439
Go on.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.841
Dale said they
had an argument.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.309
The police were
all over us,

20:45.311 --> 20:46.811
investigating Dale.

20:46.813 --> 20:49.513
They never told me
what was going on.

20:49.515 --> 20:51.349
I was going crazy,

20:51.351 --> 20:53.951
and Dale just hid
in that damn trailer,

20:53.953 --> 20:55.953
no phone,
just hiding.

20:55.955 --> 20:58.356
That girl...

20:58.358 --> 20:59.624
she looks like Wendy.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.359
(siren blares in distance)

21:03.496 --> 21:08.633
Sorry about
the rough ride.

21:08.635 --> 21:10.768
We couldn't take the chance
of him seeing you.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.037
I put the blankets in the trunk
in the back

21:13.039 --> 21:14.839
to make sure
that you were more comfortable.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.340
I hope that was okay.

21:17.377 --> 21:18.809
Was it okay?

21:18.811 --> 21:20.811
Yeah, it was okay.

21:20.813 --> 21:22.280
Good.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.383
You like that?

21:25.384 --> 21:27.318
I thought you might want
to put on some new clothes,

21:27.320 --> 21:28.319
something fresh.

21:28.321 --> 21:29.820
Thank you.

21:32.425 --> 21:35.493
Wendy loves butterflies.

21:35.495 --> 21:37.428
Wendy?

21:37.430 --> 21:38.663
You know, it's time

21:38.665 --> 21:41.999
someone cooked for you
for a change.

21:42.001 --> 21:45.002
I've got roast chicken,

21:45.004 --> 21:47.538
garlic mashed potatoes.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.006
Your favorite, right?

21:49.008 --> 21:50.775
I never would've thought

21:50.776 --> 21:52.543
to add the caramelized onions
until I saw you do it.

21:52.545 --> 21:55.713
You saw me do it?

21:55.715 --> 21:57.682
When you started
seeing Jeff,

21:57.684 --> 21:59.650
I had to keep an eye on you.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.485
(gulping)

22:01.487 --> 22:02.653
I kept my distance,
of course.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.455
I didn't want
to interfere.

22:04.457 --> 22:08.426
It's not easy
watching you like that.

22:08.428 --> 22:09.827
I am not

22:09.829 --> 22:12.396
going to take my eyes
off you again.

22:12.398 --> 22:13.564
Not for a second.

22:17.570 --> 22:20.037
(sighs)

22:20.039 --> 22:21.572
Ha.
(laughing)

22:21.574 --> 22:23.407
Anyway...

22:25.345 --> 22:27.645
We're together again.

22:27.647 --> 22:29.480
So, let's not worry
about the past.

22:29.482 --> 22:30.648
Would you like
a glass of wine?

22:30.650 --> 22:32.616
No, thanks.

22:32.618 --> 22:33.584
Maybe with lunch. Yes?

22:33.586 --> 22:34.985
Right.

22:34.987 --> 22:37.054
Okay. Good.

22:39.592 --> 22:41.125
Who's Wendy?

22:46.632 --> 22:47.832
It's my daughter.

22:47.834 --> 22:49.367
How old is she?

22:49.369 --> 22:51.369
She's 21.

22:51.371 --> 22:52.636
So, what does she
do? Does she...

22:52.638 --> 22:54.772
I'd rather not
talk about it.

22:54.774 --> 22:57.541
Okay?

22:57.543 --> 22:59.710
(sighing)

22:59.712 --> 23:01.078
(sniffling)

23:06.719 --> 23:09.687
Ah, I'm sorry.
It's the onions.

23:14.761 --> 23:17.061
No!

23:31.677 --> 23:34.145
ED (over radio):
Get ready, guys. Boss said
after two miles of dirt road,

23:34.147 --> 23:36.046
trailer should be right there.

23:36.048 --> 23:37.815
Any other population up here?

23:37.817 --> 23:39.717
Campgrounds, cabins?

23:39.719 --> 23:41.018
Not according
to the satellite images.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.753
Just trees, trees,
and more trees.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.455
Let's move it. Let's go.

23:44.457 --> 23:45.723
(vehicle accelerates)

23:55.201 --> 23:56.767
(vehicle approaching)

23:56.769 --> 23:58.035
Stop!

23:58.037 --> 23:59.904
Stop!

24:00.873 --> 24:02.940
Oh, my God, no!

24:08.448 --> 24:09.680
Help!

24:22.628 --> 24:24.762
ED:
Boss, they were just here.

24:24.764 --> 24:27.064
Door's open; food on the stove;
car's missing.

24:27.066 --> 24:29.066
Table set for two.
Zoe's still alive.

24:29.068 --> 24:31.135
At least she was until
they left in a hurry.

24:31.137 --> 24:32.970
Hidden in the back
of Dale's closet.

24:32.972 --> 24:36.140
SPIKE:
Pictures of Zoe,
her class schedule.

24:37.743 --> 24:39.743
Boss, he's had her under
the microscope for months.

24:39.745 --> 24:41.779
She didn't even know it.

24:41.781 --> 24:43.714
Sometimes it's the quiet ones

24:43.716 --> 24:44.949
you gotta worry about.

24:44.951 --> 24:47.017
All right, just keep looking.

24:47.019 --> 24:47.985
Fast is good.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.520
Copy that.

24:49.522 --> 24:50.721
Guys, transponders on.

24:50.723 --> 24:52.089
Fan out, full stealth.

24:52.091 --> 24:54.158
Wordy, contact regional PD.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.493
Get them to keep watch
for a red Nebraska

24:55.495 --> 24:56.660
in case our friends
hit the highway.

24:56.662 --> 24:58.562
Leah, you're with me.
You got it.

24:58.564 --> 25:01.765
I'll get the parabolic mic,
see what we can pick up.

25:01.767 --> 25:04.101
Well, good news.

25:04.103 --> 25:06.137
Uh...

25:06.138 --> 25:08.172
Dale and Zoe were at the
trailer, like you said

25:08.174 --> 25:10.975
and just a matter of time
before my team finds them.

25:13.079 --> 25:17.681
Mrs. Murray, do you think that
your ex-husband was responsible

25:17.683 --> 25:19.149
for your daughter's
disappearance?

25:20.720 --> 25:24.054
He started acting... odd.

25:24.056 --> 25:26.557
Go on, please.

25:26.559 --> 25:30.027
When I'd try to talk to him,
he was... not there.

25:30.029 --> 25:33.931
Stopped bathing, eating,
lived in his own world,

25:33.933 --> 25:36.934
locked away in his trailer,
cut off from everyone.

25:36.936 --> 25:38.302
Sounds like he
had a breakdown.

25:38.304 --> 25:39.970
Did he get any help?

25:39.972 --> 25:43.073
He wouldn't stop staring
at her photo, saying

25:43.075 --> 25:45.576
he loved her too much.
Saying sorry to her.

25:45.578 --> 25:48.746
He started talking
about how he wanted to die.

25:48.748 --> 25:52.182
I made him go
into the Greenfalls Institute.

25:52.184 --> 25:54.318
Greenfalls Institute.
Hold on one moment.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.055
Team 1 team leader,
you copy?

25:58.057 --> 26:00.090
ED:
Copy.
Okay, be advised

26:00.092 --> 26:02.593
that the subject has spent time
in a mental facility.

26:02.595 --> 26:05.229
Dealing with a possible EDP.

26:10.202 --> 26:12.636
You shouldn't have done that.

26:12.638 --> 26:13.737
I'm sorry.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.573
Sweetie, you can't run away.

26:15.575 --> 26:17.241
It's not safe for you out here.

26:17.243 --> 26:19.243
(sobbing):
I just want to go home.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.745
Honey, this is your home.

26:21.747 --> 26:25.082
Please, Dale.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.184
Well, I'm doing this for you.

26:27.186 --> 26:28.986
Can't you understand that?

26:30.723 --> 26:33.324
Oh, sweetheart.
Sweetie, don't cry.

26:33.326 --> 26:36.827
We're going to be happy here,
just the two of us.

26:36.829 --> 26:37.895
I know we will.

26:37.897 --> 26:39.597
No.

26:39.599 --> 26:41.265
No?

26:41.267 --> 26:43.601
I don't understand.
You used to love it here.

26:43.603 --> 26:45.202
Don't you remember?

26:45.204 --> 26:47.137
Honey, you used
to beg me to stay.

26:47.139 --> 26:48.939
You never wanted to go home.

26:48.941 --> 26:52.209
Dale, what do you mean?

26:54.146 --> 26:56.180
Dale?

27:01.854 --> 27:03.120
Vehicle approaching.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.321
ED:
Talk to me, Spike.

27:04.323 --> 27:06.223
South-southwest from you.

27:06.225 --> 27:07.291
ED:
Is it our red Nebraska?

27:07.293 --> 27:08.792
Can't hear the make and color.

27:08.794 --> 27:10.694
It's definitely an old car.

27:10.696 --> 27:12.062
I'll bet he's heading
back to the trailer.

27:16.302 --> 27:18.636
ZOE:
It's the police.

27:19.839 --> 27:22.339
Ed, he's braked.
He's reversing.

27:24.944 --> 27:26.077
Okay, Spike. We got him.

27:26.078 --> 27:27.211
All these roads lead
to the same place.

27:29.215 --> 27:31.248
Follow my transponder signal in.

27:36.088 --> 27:37.821
How long at Greenfalls?

27:37.823 --> 27:39.089
Six months.

27:39.091 --> 27:40.157
And how was he diagnosed?

27:40.159 --> 27:42.960
Severe depression.
Acute, um...

27:42.962 --> 27:44.895
something paranoid.

27:44.897 --> 27:47.731
Acute delusional paranoia?

27:47.733 --> 27:52.069
He kept imagining
he'd finally found Wendy

27:52.071 --> 27:54.972
and that people were trying
to take her away again.

27:54.974 --> 27:56.206
But when he was
discharged,

27:56.208 --> 27:59.810
his symptoms were
under control, right?

27:59.812 --> 28:01.311
No.

28:01.313 --> 28:03.180
Greenfalls is voluntary.
He discharged himself.

28:03.182 --> 28:05.149
When he did,
he wouldn't talk to me.

28:05.151 --> 28:07.885
Wouldn't touch me.

28:07.887 --> 28:10.287
He moved his trailer
to the woods.

28:10.289 --> 28:11.422
Spent all his time there.

28:11.424 --> 28:14.224
I filed for divorce a year ago.

28:14.226 --> 28:16.460
Sounds like he never got better.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.362
How could he?

28:18.364 --> 28:21.131
Living with the guilt
of what he did.

28:21.133 --> 28:23.067
What do you think he did?

28:23.069 --> 28:24.968
You tell me.

28:24.970 --> 28:27.004
You think he killed Wendy.

28:30.376 --> 28:32.309
(sobbing)

28:32.311 --> 28:34.078
I'm going to go
make a phone call.

28:34.080 --> 28:36.146
I'm going to be right back.

28:39.251 --> 28:41.385
LEAH:
There's the car.

28:41.387 --> 28:43.220
We got a visual.

28:43.222 --> 28:44.488
You want to approach direct

28:44.489 --> 28:45.755
or cover from the truck?
What do you want to do?

28:45.758 --> 28:47.157
Hit it hard.
Copy that.

28:47.159 --> 28:49.293
ED:
Vehicle's immobilized.
We're moving in.

28:49.295 --> 28:51.161
WORDY:
Alpha team approaching
on your left.

28:51.163 --> 28:53.230
SAM:
Bravo on your right.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.499
Police!
Police!

28:57.069 --> 28:59.203
Clear!

28:59.205 --> 29:00.404
Clear!

29:00.406 --> 29:02.339
He thinks he has
a better shot on foot.

29:02.341 --> 29:03.307
Probably knows
these woods

29:03.309 --> 29:05.309
inside out.

29:05.311 --> 29:07.511
All right. Ten meters apart.

29:07.513 --> 29:10.147
Do not engage until
we're in a control position.

29:10.149 --> 29:11.381
Remember:
he's still armed.

29:11.383 --> 29:13.183
Wendy Murray.

29:13.185 --> 29:15.385
You're going to have to refresh
my memory, Sergeant.

29:15.387 --> 29:17.254
PARKER:
She was 18 years old, Detective.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.289
She disappeared
about three years ago.

29:19.291 --> 29:21.759
She got on a bus on her way
to college. Never seen again.

29:21.761 --> 29:23.861
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
I remember the case.

29:23.863 --> 29:25.763
We beat the bushes on that one.

29:25.765 --> 29:27.765
We chased every lead,
every scrap.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.833
And?
DETECTIVE:
She bought a bus ticket.

29:29.835 --> 29:32.136
She intended to get
to her destination.

29:32.138 --> 29:33.437
Why she didn't, we don't know.

29:33.439 --> 29:34.972
Okay, but, the father, Dale.

29:34.974 --> 29:36.340
You think he was involved?

29:36.342 --> 29:37.441
We looked at him.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.810
Had to. It was our only lead.

29:39.812 --> 29:42.479
But in the end, we found
no evidence whatsoever.

29:42.481 --> 29:44.915
The kid had a fight
with her dad.

29:44.917 --> 29:47.317
She was 18. Par for the course.

29:47.319 --> 29:48.619
No connection.

29:48.620 --> 29:49.920
You don't think
she's still out there?

29:49.922 --> 29:51.421
No phone call at Christmas.

29:51.423 --> 29:53.323
No contact of any kind.

29:53.325 --> 29:54.858
She hasn't got any money.

29:54.860 --> 29:56.393
Social insurance untouched

29:56.395 --> 29:57.427
for three years.

29:57.429 --> 29:59.463
Yeah. I hear you. I hear you.

29:59.465 --> 30:02.166
There's only so long
we can keep looking for a body.

30:02.168 --> 30:04.067
Look, the ex-wife,

30:04.069 --> 30:05.869
she's convinced
that the father is responsible.

30:05.871 --> 30:09.306
Now, you're saying there's
no reason to suspect this guy?

30:09.308 --> 30:12.810
No. I investigate 100
missing persons cases a year,

30:12.812 --> 30:14.111
a lot of them kids.

30:14.113 --> 30:16.046
Where there's no body,
there's no closure.

30:16.048 --> 30:19.049
It wouldn't be the first time
I've seen parents lose it,

30:19.051 --> 30:21.418
start pointing fingers
at each other.

30:21.420 --> 30:23.821
Yeah.

30:23.823 --> 30:25.889
Yeah. Thanks, Detective.

30:28.060 --> 30:29.860
(phone beeps off)

30:36.502 --> 30:39.269
Dale, stop!

30:39.271 --> 30:40.470
Quiet!

30:40.472 --> 30:41.839
Help!

30:41.841 --> 30:43.106
I got them.

30:43.108 --> 30:44.241
ED:
Where?

30:44.243 --> 30:46.510
750 feet northeast,
straight ahead.

30:46.512 --> 30:48.512
(screaming)
Shh!

30:48.514 --> 30:50.047
I've got to be quiet.

30:51.584 --> 30:53.417
We need to stop.
Shh!

30:53.419 --> 30:55.519
Help! Help me!

30:55.521 --> 30:57.387
Wendy. Wendy, please.
They're going to hear you.

30:57.389 --> 30:59.389
I am not Wendy!

30:59.391 --> 31:01.458
Come on.

31:02.628 --> 31:04.595
Police! Stop right there!

31:08.500 --> 31:10.100
Oh, my God.

31:10.102 --> 31:11.869
ED:
Police! Don't move!

31:13.005 --> 31:14.938
Dale Murray, stay where you are.

31:23.515 --> 31:25.949
ED:
There's nowhere to run, Dale.

31:25.951 --> 31:27.117
Drop your weapon!

31:27.119 --> 31:29.353
You stay back!

31:29.355 --> 31:30.554
(Zoe screaming, muffled)

31:37.229 --> 31:38.428
Stay back!

31:45.537 --> 31:49.439
Mrs.... Mrs. Murray...

31:52.077 --> 31:54.244
Dale didn't do anything
to Wendy.

31:54.246 --> 31:57.948
He's doing what
you're doing now.

31:57.950 --> 31:59.082
What do you mean?

31:59.084 --> 32:01.318
He's looking
for someone to blame.

32:01.320 --> 32:03.453
The only thing
in this world worse

32:03.455 --> 32:07.157
than losing a child is not
knowing what happened to her.

32:08.427 --> 32:10.994
You're blaming Dale
because that's an answer.

32:10.996 --> 32:13.363
And Dale's blaming himself
because that's an answer, too.

32:13.365 --> 32:14.998
But it's not
the right answer.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.501
Because neither one
of you are to blame.

32:20.105 --> 32:21.438
I'm sorry,

32:21.440 --> 32:23.307
but Wendy is gone.

32:23.309 --> 32:25.342
Judith, she is gone.

32:25.344 --> 32:29.479
And that is what you need
to start dealing with.

32:29.481 --> 32:34.985
Now, Zoe and Dale, they're
going to come home safely.

32:34.987 --> 32:37.187
And when he does,
he's going to need help.

32:37.189 --> 32:39.022
You can help him.

32:39.024 --> 32:40.190
You can be there.

32:40.192 --> 32:42.659
If you're willing.

32:51.337 --> 32:54.271
SAM:
Got the solution.

32:54.273 --> 32:56.039
We take out Dale, Zoe will go
over the edge with him.

32:56.041 --> 32:57.407
SAM:
Copy that.

32:57.409 --> 32:58.508
PARKER:
Team 1, status?

32:58.510 --> 33:00.027
ED:
Boss, we got him contained,

33:00.028 --> 33:01.545
but he's still got Zoe,
and he's still armed,

33:01.547 --> 33:04.181
and they're looking down
at a 150-foot drop.

33:04.183 --> 33:05.749
PARKER:
Okay, team, listen up.

33:05.751 --> 33:07.584
Dale doesn't want to hurt Zoe

33:07.586 --> 33:10.487
because he believes
that Zoe is his daughter.

33:10.489 --> 33:11.521
Go on, Sarge.

33:11.523 --> 33:12.973
You lose your daughter,

33:12.974 --> 33:14.424
she's missing for three years,
and you've got a choice.

33:14.426 --> 33:16.426
You can accept that she's dead,

33:16.428 --> 33:17.694
or you can believe that

33:17.696 --> 33:19.363
she's still alive.

33:19.364 --> 33:21.031
And Zoe looks like his daughter;
she gets under his skin.

33:21.033 --> 33:22.366
He's trying to protect her.

33:22.368 --> 33:24.501
And a father always wants
to protect his children.

33:24.503 --> 33:25.986
Okay.

33:25.987 --> 33:27.470
He is delusional, no question.
I'm sure

33:27.473 --> 33:29.206
he's not very happy to see you
right now, is he?

33:29.208 --> 33:31.475
Okay, well,
No, no, he isn't.

33:31.477 --> 33:34.177
that's probably because the cops
planted that seed.

33:34.179 --> 33:37.347
A father gets investigated and
he starts to feel responsible.

33:37.349 --> 33:39.649
So, just...

33:39.651 --> 33:41.451
just go careful, Eddie.

33:41.453 --> 33:43.620
We gotta stabilize him here.

33:43.622 --> 33:46.490
We gotta decrease
pressure.

33:46.492 --> 33:47.557
PARKER:
Okay, Jules...

33:47.559 --> 33:49.309
Go, Sarge.

33:49.310 --> 33:51.060
Jules, I want you to lead
this negotiation.

33:51.063 --> 33:52.229
I'm going to be your secondary.

33:52.231 --> 33:55.432
Got it.

33:55.434 --> 33:56.566
Spike,

33:56.568 --> 33:57.667
you got ears?
I'll get the mic

33:57.669 --> 33:58.735
in up close, report back.

34:00.339 --> 34:02.039
All right, we've got to watch

34:02.041 --> 34:03.407
Dale's back here.

34:03.409 --> 34:05.809
We could rappel down the cliff,
contain him from behind.

34:05.811 --> 34:07.677
It's too risky. He'll see you.

34:07.679 --> 34:08.745
Plenty of trees for cover.

34:08.747 --> 34:10.347
Static rope will get us down.

34:10.349 --> 34:11.748
We can traverse across
to their exact location.

34:11.750 --> 34:13.617
All right.

34:13.619 --> 34:15.752
Don't crest that cliff
till you hear my go.

34:15.754 --> 34:17.821
Copy.

34:19.191 --> 34:20.791
Okay, I got the sweet spot.

34:20.793 --> 34:22.225
I can hear him now.

34:22.227 --> 34:24.294
It's okay. It's okay. Shh.

34:27.099 --> 34:28.832
Hey, Dale, my name's Jules.

34:28.834 --> 34:30.067
You stay back!

34:30.069 --> 34:31.218
Absolutely.

34:31.219 --> 34:32.368
I'm gonna take
a few steps back here

34:32.371 --> 34:34.104
and give you some space.

34:34.105 --> 34:35.838
PARKER:
Now remember, it's all about
keeping Zoe close to him.

34:35.841 --> 34:38.208
He's just found his daughter.
He's not going to let go of her.

34:38.210 --> 34:41.244
Dale, you're really close
to the edge right now.

34:41.246 --> 34:43.547
You want to keep
her safer,

34:43.549 --> 34:45.749
you might want to take
a few steps forward.

34:54.159 --> 34:55.626
Set the anchors

34:55.627 --> 34:57.094
no more than ten feet apart.
You got it.

35:05.104 --> 35:06.503
JULES:
Quick question, Sarge.

35:06.505 --> 35:08.138
If he thinks Zoe's
his daughter...

35:08.140 --> 35:09.389
Don't contradict him,

35:09.390 --> 35:10.639
but don't reinforce his delusion

35:10.642 --> 35:12.476
either.
Find common ground.

35:12.478 --> 35:13.677
That's right.

35:13.679 --> 35:15.245
Your job isn't to cure him,
Jules.

35:15.247 --> 35:17.380
Your job is to just guide him
out of this crisis.

35:17.382 --> 35:18.548
That's it,
and you're doing great.

35:18.550 --> 35:20.550
Just keep doing
what you're doing.

35:20.552 --> 35:21.818
Hey, Dale, can you
tell me something

35:21.820 --> 35:23.153
about the woman you're with.

35:23.155 --> 35:24.821
I can tell
that she means a lot to you.

35:24.823 --> 35:27.657
You know, I admire

35:27.659 --> 35:29.659
what you're trying
to do right now.

35:29.661 --> 35:32.329
I do. You're putting up a fight
for what you think is right.

35:32.331 --> 35:34.731
You're putting yourself
on the line.

35:34.733 --> 35:37.901
No response means that
you've got his attention.

35:37.903 --> 35:39.703
I think we all want
the same thing here.

35:39.705 --> 35:41.538
SPIKE:
Hold on.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.540
Playing mind games
Hold on, I got something.

35:43.542 --> 35:45.208
with us again.

35:45.210 --> 35:46.810
He says you're playing
mind games, Jules.

35:46.812 --> 35:49.880
They think after all this time
I'm gonna give you up.

35:49.882 --> 35:51.414
Let go of me!

35:51.416 --> 35:52.415
No! No!

35:52.417 --> 35:53.750
Don't go!
I'm not Wendy!

35:53.752 --> 35:55.285
I don't need you
to protect me.

35:55.287 --> 35:56.353
Don't go!

35:56.355 --> 35:57.888
Don't go, please.
You gotta trust me.

35:57.890 --> 35:59.689
You gotta trust me.
Please, please.

35:59.691 --> 36:00.924
Zoe, take it easy!

36:00.926 --> 36:02.759
Take it easy, Zoe.
Come on, guys. Talk to me.

36:02.761 --> 36:04.427
Boss, Zoe pulled a runner.
What's going on?

36:04.429 --> 36:05.762
He's got her back.

36:05.764 --> 36:08.165
It's escalating.

36:08.167 --> 36:09.499
Good.
Boss, we're in position.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.368
Hold position.
Wait for my command.

36:11.370 --> 36:12.869
JULES:
Okay, Zoe...
No! Don't go!

36:12.871 --> 36:14.905
Take it easy, Zoe.
Take it easy.
Don't go!

36:14.907 --> 36:16.306
Dale, why don't you let her go.

36:16.308 --> 36:17.440
Let's see what she's got to say.

36:17.442 --> 36:19.176
I'm not going to let her go!

36:19.178 --> 36:21.378
Jules, you gotta jump in there.
You gotta take control.

36:21.380 --> 36:24.181
Dale, what happened to Wendy
was not your fault.

36:24.183 --> 36:25.515
I'm not letting her go!

36:25.517 --> 36:27.551
If I let her go,
I'm going to lose her forever.

36:27.553 --> 36:28.652
(Zoe whimpering)

36:32.558 --> 36:33.223
No!

36:33.225 --> 36:33.957
Got him.

36:33.959 --> 36:35.625
(Zoe sobbing)

36:35.627 --> 36:37.527
(screams)
Zoe, hang on!

36:38.630 --> 36:40.463
I got you,
I got you.

36:40.465 --> 36:42.199
We've got him.

36:42.201 --> 36:43.466
Easy, Dale.

36:43.468 --> 36:44.968
Guys, secure
the ropes.

36:46.305 --> 36:47.671
(grunts)

36:47.673 --> 36:49.606
Leah's line's secure.

36:49.608 --> 36:50.874
Got Sam tied down.

36:50.876 --> 36:52.242
You've got

36:52.244 --> 36:53.243
to let go of her,
all right?

36:53.245 --> 36:55.095
I'm not going to let go!

36:55.096 --> 36:56.946
Is this what you call
keeping someone safe, Dale?

36:56.949 --> 36:58.882
Listen to me,

36:58.884 --> 37:01.751
I am sorry that Wendy
disappeared from your life.

37:01.753 --> 37:02.919
I cannot

37:02.921 --> 37:05.422
even imagine what
you have been through.

37:05.424 --> 37:08.892
But I do know what it is like
to lose somebody who had

37:08.894 --> 37:10.760
absolutely no business dying.

37:10.762 --> 37:12.262
(panting)

37:12.264 --> 37:15.599
And to not have a chance
to say good-bye.

37:15.601 --> 37:17.951
And to be disgusted with people

37:17.952 --> 37:20.302
for just walking down the street
like the world's the same place.

37:22.574 --> 37:26.243
That if you had just done
something different...

37:26.245 --> 37:28.778
they still might
be there.

37:30.816 --> 37:34.017
So you can keep on
struggling,

37:34.019 --> 37:37.020
and get both of yourselves
killed,

37:37.022 --> 37:39.522
and that will be your fault.

37:39.524 --> 37:42.559
Or you can let go...

37:44.529 --> 37:47.797
...and let yourselves live.

37:51.737 --> 37:54.804
What would Wendy want you to do?

37:59.011 --> 38:01.578
What would she want you to do,
Dale?

38:01.580 --> 38:03.046
(sobbing):
I'm sorry.

38:03.048 --> 38:05.982
I'm sorry.

38:07.052 --> 38:09.052
Let's get her up.

38:09.054 --> 38:11.021
Bring him up.

38:20.365 --> 38:23.466
("Now the Struggle Has a Name"
by Tragically Hip playing)

38:33.879 --> 38:36.413
¶ Now ¶

38:36.415 --> 38:40.450
¶ The apology done ¶

38:40.452 --> 38:46.022
¶ Applause can begin ¶

38:47.959 --> 38:49.993
¶ Now ¶

38:49.995 --> 38:53.997
¶ The apology's done ¶

38:53.999 --> 39:00.637
¶ Applause begins ¶

39:00.639 --> 39:06.543
¶ If it bleeds, it leads ¶

39:06.545 --> 39:13.550
¶ If it cries, it flies ¶

39:14.486 --> 39:19.055
¶ If it feeds a need ¶

39:19.991 --> 39:24.494
¶ If it dies ¶

39:24.496 --> 39:28.565
¶ It dies ¶

39:42.948 --> 39:47.584
¶ Now the struggle has a name ¶

39:48.553 --> 39:51.588
¶ It doesn't fade... ¶

39:51.590 --> 39:53.022
It's not much,

39:53.024 --> 39:55.058
but it helps.

39:55.060 --> 39:57.060
You carry your friends
with you.

39:57.062 --> 40:01.898
¶ I still feel the same ¶

40:01.900 --> 40:07.737
¶ Now the struggle has a name ¶

¶ Oh ¶

¶ Now the struggle has a name ¶
