00:01.990 --> 00:03.132
Okay, everyone

00:03.150 --> 00:05.432
time to divvy up
what's in the Lost & Found box.

00:05.650 --> 00:08.232
If my dignity's in there,
tell it I say "What up."

00:09.415 --> 00:11.017
This is my favorite
day of the month.

00:11.715 --> 00:13.917
Oh, God, I've fallen
so far so fast.

00:15.033 --> 00:16.832
You haven't fallen that far.

00:16.833 --> 00:18.132

A scrunchie.

00:18.133 --> 00:20.668
I need that.
Give me!

00:20.669 --> 00:23.437
I think I hit my bottom.

00:23.438 --> 00:25.105
Okay, next item.

00:25.106 --> 00:26.507
A pregnancy test.

00:26.508 --> 00:28.809
That's empty.
What?

00:28.810 --> 00:32.012
I had two free minutes,
and you never know.

00:32.012 --> 00:34.181
Can we move this along?

00:34.182 --> 00:37.451
I'm an old man,
and I need to get to bed.

00:45.493 --> 00:48.395
No money.

00:48.396 --> 00:50.064
What?
If I was pregnant,

00:50.065 --> 00:52.668
I needed it for the baby.

00:54.669 --> 00:58.072
And finally
for the sixth month in a row...

If I had to take
a picture in it,

01:08.049 --> 01:09.883
you have to take
a picture in it.

01:09.884 --> 01:11.218
Okay, fine.

Man, I'm a fun boss.

Oh, sorry, sir.

I ran so fast,
the librarian said,

01:50.241 --> 01:52.275
"Stop running in the library,"
and I almost said,

"This is different.
I'm stealing."

about us.

could be our brains.

I could find was Han's blazer.

It's itchy, and there's
a piece of paper in the pocket

09:06.797 --> 09:07.862

09:24.547 --> 09:26.481
Sisters doing it for themselves.

09:26.483 --> 09:28.399
[Chuckling]
Well, I'm doing it

09:28.401 --> 09:30.852
for the medical benefits.

09:30.854 --> 09:33.154
- Go.
- Oh, now?

09:33.156 --> 09:35.356
Before she gets here?

09:35.358 --> 09:37.909
Um, well, I'm not really much
of a business person.

09:38.211 --> 09:42.163
Great way to start
a business loan application.

09:42.665 --> 09:43.564
Go!

09:43.566 --> 09:44.769
You have a minute.

09:48.771 --> 09:53.258
Okay, well, um,
how much time do I have now?

09:53.260 --> 09:55.627
Slightly less than a minute.

09:56.329 --> 09:59.047
Okay, uh, my business partner

09:59.049 --> 10:01.049
could explain this
better than me, but I'll try.

10:01.051 --> 10:02.767
[Clears throat]

10:02.769 --> 10:05.019
[Almost inaudible]
We have a cupcake business.

10:05.021 --> 10:09.057
And we bake cupcakes
in my roommate's bedroom.

10:10.059 --> 10:11.392
I can't hear you.

10:11.894 --> 10:14.946
You want to write it down,
draw it, shape it in clay?

10:16.448 --> 10:17.699
I would have
filled this out more,

10:17.701 --> 10:19.868
but that chick over there
wouldn't let me cheat off her.

10:19.870 --> 10:22.103
She's not a girl's girl,
know what I mean?

10:23.105 --> 10:24.956
Very professional.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.208
Under past loan repayment,

10:27.210 --> 10:31.129
you put, "Paid Todd back
all the beer money I owed."

10:31.631 --> 10:33.965
To be fair,
he was drunk all the time.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.333
I could have just said I did.

10:35.335 --> 10:36.668
Points for honesty.

10:37.670 --> 10:40.471
Let's get you
a new loan application.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.956
Just got your message.

10:41.958 --> 10:43.791
The one time I don't come early.

10:43.793 --> 10:48.396
Speaking of that, I just had
the most amazing orgasm.

10:48.398 --> 10:50.014
I mean, we've been having
really great sex,

10:50.016 --> 10:53.401
but this morning,
I could not get enough of his--

10:53.403 --> 10:57.305
projected growth ratio
investment analysis.

10:57.307 --> 10:58.606
Hello, Caroline Channing.

10:58.608 --> 10:59.991
Wharton class of '09.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.410
That's our business proposal.

11:02.412 --> 11:03.811
And I would be
a little embarrassed

11:03.813 --> 11:05.330
about what just happened
if I didn't know

11:05.332 --> 11:06.814
that we're all just girls here.

11:06.816 --> 11:08.700
Can we move this along?

11:08.702 --> 11:12.036
I got a busted toilet
and a pregnant dog at home.

11:14.256 --> 11:16.374
Why didn't you tell me
she was under there?

11:16.376 --> 11:18.543
Oh, sorry,
I wasn't expecting a monologue

11:18.545 --> 11:20.762
from
<i>Confessions of a Call Girl.</i>

11:20.764 --> 11:23.598
I'm afraid we're gonna have
to deny the loan.

11:24.400 --> 11:26.517
Why? Because she had
a good orgasm?

11:26.519 --> 11:29.771
Isn't that what the '70s
was about for you gals?

11:29.773 --> 11:32.023
You have no business history.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.775
And that's a requirement for us.

11:34.277 --> 11:36.194
Well, I think we're done here.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.646
Yeah.
I just said that.

11:38.648 --> 11:40.014
I thought you guys were

11:40.016 --> 11:42.200
about supporting
small women's business.

11:42.202 --> 11:45.019
And this small woman's
"bidness" needs support

11:45.021 --> 11:47.322
after the pounding
it took today.

11:47.324 --> 11:49.574
Max, let's go.

11:54.029 --> 11:56.030
Okay, there's a bank
in New Hampshire

11:56.032 --> 11:58.366
that doesn't check anything.

11:58.368 --> 12:01.035
And before someone else
grabs our cupcake space,

12:01.037 --> 12:02.587
I say we get on a bus
and go up there.

12:02.589 --> 12:04.339
They won't give out
their exact address,

12:04.341 --> 12:06.341
but I know they're in
a mini mall with a white castle.

12:06.343 --> 12:07.708
Better idea.

12:08.510 --> 12:10.178
I went to Craigslist,

12:10.180 --> 12:12.764
clicked on "etc" and found

12:12.766 --> 12:15.233
all kinds of opportunities
to make some cash.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.852
I'm fighting the instinct
to weep, but keep going.

12:17.854 --> 12:20.388
At first I thought
I might call pit pig.

12:20.390 --> 12:21.906
He just wants
his armpits smelled,

12:21.908 --> 12:23.241
but that's, like, 1,000 sniffs.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.109
Big commitment.

12:25.111 --> 12:28.279
Or there's the weirdo
looking for pretty amputees,

12:28.281 --> 12:29.831
but that feels
like a bigger commitment.

12:29.833 --> 12:32.166
So, check it.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.368
"Egg donors needed.

12:33.370 --> 12:34.686
Ten to twenty grand."

12:34.688 --> 12:37.121
No way,
I could never sell my eggs.

12:37.123 --> 12:38.423
I mean, wouldn't you
hate to think

12:38.425 --> 12:39.841
you had a kid out there
and not know it?

12:39.843 --> 12:41.211
I probably do.

12:43.213 --> 12:46.931
In 2006, I invented the Four Loko
and Robitussin smoothie.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.599
It's pretty much
a blackout year.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.386
Seriously, for the right price
I'd sell 'em all.

12:51.388 --> 12:52.754
Really?

12:52.756 --> 12:54.822
I mean,
I know you've always been tough.

12:54.824 --> 12:56.090
To hear you tell it,
you were part

12:56.092 --> 12:57.759
of an underground
baby fight club.

12:57.761 --> 12:59.777
But don't you wanna be
a mom some day?

12:59.779 --> 13:01.595
In the history of the world,

13:01.597 --> 13:03.764
give me one example
of a really good mother.

13:04.266 --> 13:05.566
You're putting me on the spot.

13:05.568 --> 13:07.652
All I can think of
is Hilary Duff.

13:08.154 --> 13:09.988
Look, you're complicating this

13:09.990 --> 13:11.990
with these things
you call emotions.

13:11.992 --> 13:13.441
Like it or not...

13:13.443 --> 13:15.443
[Bawks like a chicken]

13:15.445 --> 13:17.612
I'm an egg farm.

13:17.614 --> 13:20.381
Because we don't know one single
person outside of New Hampshire

13:20.383 --> 13:21.883
who can lend us
that kind of money.

13:21.885 --> 13:26.220
Yoo-hoo, girls,
look out the window.

13:28.674 --> 13:30.292
Up here!
It's me!

13:31.794 --> 13:35.763
Oleg and I would like
two cupcakes please.

13:36.765 --> 13:38.516
I feel weird
asking Sophie for money.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.184
And how do we
even know she has any?

13:40.186 --> 13:42.186
Well, she's building
her dream house in Poland

13:42.188 --> 13:44.138
between a former death camp
and a new W.

13:44.140 --> 13:46.024
She's gotta be loaded.

13:46.026 --> 13:48.192
And Sophie's the kind of woman
who understands our dreams.

13:48.194 --> 13:49.412
Come in.

13:55.784 --> 13:57.785
That's exactly
what I thought would be

13:57.787 --> 13:59.120
on the other side of that door.

13:59.122 --> 14:02.006
Oleg, sweetie,
we have company.

14:02.008 --> 14:04.425
I brought you an ass pillow.

14:05.427 --> 14:08.546
Nice to see you like this
outside of work, girls, no?

14:08.548 --> 14:12.666
Both: No.

14:13.568 --> 14:17.555
Girls, did you see
my big hanging thing?

14:18.057 --> 14:20.274
Yeah, we kinda just saw it.

14:20.276 --> 14:25.012
No, I'm talking about my new
ch-andelier for my lake house.

14:25.014 --> 14:28.682
Yeah, I can totally see you
drinking ch-ardonnay under it.

14:28.684 --> 14:31.369
Oh, Max, you are so funny.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.254
She's a real ch-aracter.

14:33.256 --> 14:35.740
Yeah, that's not a word.

14:36.242 --> 14:37.925
Okay, well,
we just wanted to bring you

14:37.927 --> 14:40.294
some more cupcakes
for free, per usual,

14:40.296 --> 14:43.364
and perhaps talk about
a possible business venture.

14:43.366 --> 14:45.533
Oh, sorry, girls.

14:45.535 --> 14:47.701
I have two rules in life:

14:47.703 --> 14:51.372
Never drink
from the same well as a gypsy

14:51.374 --> 14:54.892
and never lend money
to friends.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.928
And, Max, you are my friend.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.814
Okay, well, we were just
checking, but thanks anyway.

14:59.816 --> 15:01.065
But, Sophie,
just hear us out.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.716
It's a wonderful
opportunity,

15:02.718 --> 15:04.235
and we'll of course
pay you back with interest.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.154
Okay, buh-bye.

15:06.156 --> 15:11.025
Let's go. We tried it.
Now it's--[Clucks]--time.

15:11.727 --> 15:13.727
You are not harvesting
your body for money.

15:13.729 --> 15:15.363
What's the big deal?

15:15.365 --> 15:18.699
I sold two kidneys
for a down payment on my house.

15:18.701 --> 15:21.202
Not true.
You need at least one to live.

15:21.704 --> 15:25.590
Oh, well,
they weren't mine.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.209
Well, you know
what we have to do.

15:28.211 --> 15:30.595
Let's get the bawk
out of here.

15:37.609 --> 15:39.960
And you're sure you're okay
with selling your eggs, right?

15:39.962 --> 15:42.063
Totally. What do I care?
I've got a million of 'em.

15:42.065 --> 15:44.431
I'm happy to lose a few.
More room for beer.

15:44.933 --> 15:46.483
Lose some eggs,
more room for beer.

15:46.585 --> 15:48.501
It's crazy
that's not their slogan.

15:48.753 --> 15:50.587
So what'd they ask you
on the application?

15:50.589 --> 15:52.288
You know, income, hobbies,

15:52.290 --> 15:53.923
"Did you ever
have sex in Africa?"

15:53.925 --> 15:56.426
[Scoffs]
I wish.

15:56.428 --> 15:58.261
The closest I ever got
was a dude once

15:58.263 --> 16:01.231
put his hand up my skirt
in an Ethiopian restaurant.

16:01.233 --> 16:03.149
You know,
now that we're here,

16:03.151 --> 16:05.518
I think it's kind of wonderful
that places like this exist

16:05.520 --> 16:08.071
to help women who can't have
babies have babies.

16:08.073 --> 16:10.742
Hey, you think they
take points off for syphilis?

16:13.744 --> 16:15.328
Max,
I think it's really noble

16:15.330 --> 16:17.080
what you're doing
to get our dream.

16:17.082 --> 16:18.615
This is a very special day.

16:19.117 --> 16:21.317
How do you spell
"chlamydia"?

16:21.819 --> 16:23.653
Well, no "k"s,

16:23.655 --> 16:26.422
and I personally
wouldn't heart the "I."

16:26.424 --> 16:28.124
Oh, thanks.

16:28.126 --> 16:31.010
And do I gotta put here
if my brother touched a kid?

16:31.012 --> 16:32.762
Max Black.

16:32.764 --> 16:34.330
Thank you
for your interest,

16:34.332 --> 16:35.798
but I'm afraid we're
gonna have to pass.

16:35.800 --> 16:38.134
Why?
I didn't have sex in Africa.

16:38.136 --> 16:40.853
Yes, I know,
that was your one plus,

16:40.855 --> 16:42.388
but under "family history,"

16:42.390 --> 16:45.108
you put "drinking"
and "secrets."

16:45.110 --> 16:47.193
I was being honest.

16:47.195 --> 16:50.563
Yeah, maybe too honest,
because under "education"

16:50.565 --> 16:52.682
you wrote,
<i>"Jeopardy</i> reruns,"

16:52.684 --> 16:55.118
and we're really
looking for college graduates.

16:55.120 --> 16:59.188
Jeez, I'll take "elitist"
for 500, Alex.

16:59.190 --> 17:01.124
Sorry,
we're looking for girls

17:01.126 --> 17:02.959
that come
from Ivy league schools

17:02.961 --> 17:05.295
and have impressive
family backgrounds.

17:05.297 --> 17:07.363
Maybe her eggs
didn't go to Wharton

17:07.365 --> 17:09.531
and graduate at the top
of their class like I did,

17:09.534 --> 17:11.200
but just look at her.

17:11.202 --> 17:14.170
Who wouldn't want a baby
with such strength, beauty,

17:14.172 --> 17:17.540
and a rack so great
it could breast-feed itself?

17:17.541 --> 17:19.559
You went to Wharton?

17:19.560 --> 17:22.762
We pay $20,000
for Ivy league eggs.

17:24.265 --> 17:27.849
[Clucks]

17:27.852 --> 17:30.019
Wow, we're
taking blood already?

17:30.021 --> 17:33.356
I guess going to Wharton
does put you on the fast track.

17:33.358 --> 17:35.575
Just part of the process
to become a donor.

17:35.577 --> 17:37.460
I'm gonna go get some vials,
and I'll be right back.

17:38.462 --> 17:40.413
It's so cool of you
to do this.

17:40.415 --> 17:41.614
It says a lot about you.

17:41.616 --> 17:43.082
You know what says
a lot about me?

17:43.084 --> 17:44.667
The fact that I know
she tied you off wrong.

17:45.969 --> 17:46.753
I'm happy to do it.

17:46.755 --> 17:50.423
It's a small price to pay
to make our dream come true.

17:50.425 --> 17:52.458
I'm doin' this
to pay down some debt.

17:52.460 --> 17:55.261
I'm real deep
'cause of Powerball.

17:55.263 --> 17:57.347
Whoa, dude,
how did you get through?

17:57.349 --> 18:01.551
I went to Harvard.
I'm like crazy-good at math.

18:01.553 --> 18:03.936
Max, she's making me nervous.
Close the curtain.

18:03.938 --> 18:05.755
And frankly,
I'm a little resentful.

18:05.757 --> 18:07.440
I didn't get into Harvard.

18:07.842 --> 18:09.258
Are you sure
you're okay with this?

18:09.260 --> 18:11.110
- 'Cause you seem a little jumpy.
- No, I'm fine.

18:11.112 --> 18:12.729
They're just taking
a little blood.

18:13.131 --> 18:14.096
Or from the looks of it,

18:14.098 --> 18:15.648
they're taking all of it.

18:15.650 --> 18:17.900
There better be a nice juice
and a cookie after this.

18:19.152 --> 18:21.537
Please relax.
It's only eight vials.

18:22.039 --> 18:24.273
They gotta take a lot to
make sure they don't get a kid

18:24.275 --> 18:26.560
with, like, another kid
growing out of it.

18:27.962 --> 18:29.579
Max, this all
just got very real.

18:29.581 --> 18:31.998
- Hold my hand.
- You know I don't hold hands.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.251
Oh, you lesbians
are so high maintenance.

18:35.753 --> 18:36.919
Please?

18:36.921 --> 18:38.337
You don't think
I'm gonna give away

18:38.339 --> 18:39.806
my best egg, right?

18:39.808 --> 18:41.641
I'm not gonna give away
the concert pianist

18:41.643 --> 18:43.309
and get stuck with the guy
who breaks into homes

18:43.311 --> 18:44.927
and smells
women's underwear?

18:44.929 --> 18:47.630
Well, either way,
you got a kid with a passion.

18:47.632 --> 18:49.131
But you don't have
to do this.

18:49.133 --> 18:51.184
No, I can do this.
It's for our dream.

18:51.186 --> 18:52.468
But you don't have
to do this.

18:52.470 --> 18:53.703
I can do this.
Put it in.

18:53.705 --> 18:54.970
It's already in.

18:54.972 --> 18:56.672
I can't do this.

18:56.674 --> 18:59.742
I'm not trashy,
I'm not some farm animal.

18:59.744 --> 19:01.828
Oh! Oh, my God!

19:05.832 --> 19:06.999
Oh, my God.

19:07.001 --> 19:09.585
I am so, so sorry!

19:09.587 --> 19:11.320
You know
what would be cute here?

19:11.322 --> 19:13.372
A cupcake store.

19:19.463 --> 19:21.998
Hi, Max.
Oh, it's chilly outside.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.668
Nipples everywhere.

19:25.670 --> 19:27.437
Have a seat.
I'll be right over.

19:27.439 --> 19:31.224
Oh, that's okay.
I texted my order in on the way.

19:31.226 --> 19:35.194
Hey, baby. I got your text.
Did you get my erotic haiku?

19:35.196 --> 19:36.846
I did.

19:36.848 --> 19:39.348
Did you get the picture I sent
of me and the dustbuster?

19:39.950 --> 19:42.819
No, I didn't.

19:42.821 --> 19:47.073
Oh, no, Grandpa Yorgish!

19:48.375 --> 19:49.358
Look.

19:49.360 --> 19:50.793
Earl framed our blurb.

19:50.795 --> 19:55.364
- He did? That is so sweet.
- What?

19:56.366 --> 19:59.201
I always saw it as bigger
on the wall in our shop.

19:59.203 --> 20:02.004
Look, the shop
is an amazing idea,

20:02.006 --> 20:03.422
and, if it's not
that space right now,

20:03.424 --> 20:04.674
it'll be another.

20:04.676 --> 20:06.092
I mean, there have to be
mass murders

20:06.094 --> 20:07.710
all over Brooklyn, right?

20:08.712 --> 20:10.313
If we're lucky.

20:10.315 --> 20:12.148
And, even
if it didn't work out,

20:12.150 --> 20:13.900
it's still the closest
I've ever come

20:13.902 --> 20:16.051
to something great,
and that's cool.

20:16.053 --> 20:19.739
And someday we'll find someone
crazy enough to lend us money.

20:19.741 --> 20:22.108
I say that because, if you can
convince me to believe a dream,

20:22.110 --> 20:23.109
you can get anyone.

20:23.611 --> 20:25.111
Pickup.
[Rings bell]

20:25.613 --> 20:28.364
Here you go, Sophie.
That's $11.25.

20:28.366 --> 20:29.967
Oh, you take a check, right?

20:31.769 --> 20:33.669
This is for $20,000.

20:33.671 --> 20:37.123
Oh, is it?
I thought it was for $20.

20:37.125 --> 20:39.009
Oh, well. Keep it.

20:40.411 --> 20:42.845
Maybe you could use it
for your dream,

20:42.847 --> 20:45.765
or to get your legs waxed,
or something.

20:45.767 --> 20:48.551
- Sophie, are you serious?
- Yes.

20:48.553 --> 20:51.103
Sophie, this is really,
really amazing.

20:51.105 --> 20:54.023
Oh, come on.
I don't need a parade.

20:54.025 --> 20:56.309
Just keep
the cupcakes coming.

20:59.563 --> 21:01.147
Max, do you know
what this means?

21:01.149 --> 21:04.099
We are going to be
a Williamsburg must-have.

21:04.101 --> 21:06.202
We're getting our dream.

21:06.704 --> 21:08.321
I feel like you want
a hug.

21:08.323 --> 21:11.123
I do.

21:17.323 --> 21:22.323
