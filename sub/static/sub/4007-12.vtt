00:10.120 --> 00:11.759
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

00:11.920 --> 00:13.036
You can't kill me.

00:13.240 --> 00:14.435
Why?

00:14.600 --> 00:16.557
Because I don't fit Harry's code.

00:16.720 --> 00:20.157
<i>Trust me when I say that there's
a place in this world for your son.</i>

00:20.320 --> 00:21.470
You're perfect.

00:21.640 --> 00:24.633
How can you still say that when
you know what I've done to Deb?

00:24.800 --> 00:26.553
I shot the wrong person
in that trailer.

00:28.080 --> 00:30.470
Why did you save me?
Why didn't you let me drown?

00:30.640 --> 00:32.871
I couldn't imagine my life
without you in it.

00:33.040 --> 00:36.192
I'm glad that you have managed to
find your way back to each other.

00:36.360 --> 00:37.874
The family that kills together...

00:38.040 --> 00:39.633
Zach's killer is related to you.

00:39.800 --> 00:42.520
The Brain Surgeon is related to you.
Daniel.

00:42.680 --> 00:44.478
He's going by the name Oliver Saxon.

00:44.640 --> 00:45.676
What are you going to do?

00:45.840 --> 00:47.911
What do you think?
He's my son.

00:48.080 --> 00:50.197
I still have feelings for you.
No, I just--

00:51.720 --> 00:53.916
Remember me?
Where do you think you'll go?

00:54.080 --> 00:56.515
I haven't decided.
Argentina.

00:59.920 --> 01:02.799
Me, you and Harrison
are gonna move to Argentina.

01:03.280 --> 01:06.796
I've got a line on Hannah McKay,
but I'm gonna need help reeling her in.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.559
He's onto you. Move fast.

01:08.720 --> 01:11.679
I tried to get an earlier flight,
but it's booked solid.

01:11.880 --> 01:13.951
I have a proposal.
We walk away.

01:14.120 --> 01:17.830
You kill your mother in front of me,
and you just expect me to forget?

01:18.000 --> 01:19.480
Evelyn?

01:19.880 --> 01:22.475
This is usually
my favourite moment, the kill.

01:22.680 --> 01:24.273
Now I don't even wanna be here.

01:24.480 --> 01:26.199
Hey, Deb, change of plans.

01:26.360 --> 01:27.430
Go get on a plane.

01:28.960 --> 01:32.749
Last site someone visited on this
computer was Aero Sudamerica.

01:32.920 --> 01:35.151
I'm gonna tail the Morgans,
see if they'll lead me to her.

01:36.600 --> 01:38.432
What the fuck is going on here?
Help me, please.

01:41.040 --> 01:43.111
Unh!
Don't move.

01:44.240 --> 01:48.154
<i>I used to live my life at night,
in the shadow of my dark passenger.</i>

01:48.320 --> 01:52.234
<i>But over the years, my eyes adjusted,
and I could see.</i>

01:52.400 --> 01:55.279
<i>And now what's in focus is my future.</i>

01:55.440 --> 01:58.990
<i>Bright. Brighter than it's ever been.</i>

01:59.160 --> 02:01.914
This is Detective Debra Morgan.
I've been shot.

03:56.680 --> 03:57.955
Are we almost there?

03:58.120 --> 04:00.191
It's, uh, Gate 209. Just a couple more.

04:00.360 --> 04:02.920
I want some Oreos.
There'll be food on the plane.

04:03.080 --> 04:04.878
Come on, you promised
to help me count.

04:05.040 --> 04:06.599
Two hundred ten.
There you go.

04:06.760 --> 04:10.197
<i>I always thought if I ever left Miami,
I'd be running for my life,</i>

04:12.000 --> 04:13.559
<i>not running towards a new one.</i>

04:13.720 --> 04:16.076
Two hundred and eleven.
Heh.

04:17.079 --> 04:18.673
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

04:18.839 --> 04:22.516
we'll begin boarding Flight 691
to Rio de Janeiro in a few moments.

04:22.680 --> 04:27.596
<i>We ask that you have your tickets
and passports ready for the attendant.</i>

04:28.640 --> 04:30.438
Where's Hannah?

04:34.240 --> 04:36.436
Hannah?
<i>Hey, where are you?</i>

04:36.600 --> 04:39.274
I'm at the gate. Where are you?
I'm in the ladies' room.

04:39.440 --> 04:40.999
Elway is in the boarding area.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.114
Come here, buddy.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.559
<i>Attention, passengers:</i>

04:47.760 --> 04:50.958
<i>We will begin pre-boarding for Aero
Sudamerica Flight 691 to Rio de Janeiro.</i>

04:51.120 --> 04:53.999
He didn't see me. Did he see you?
I don't think so.

04:54.160 --> 04:57.631
He's got a clear view of the Jetway.
He must have bought a ticket.

04:57.800 --> 05:00.156
We won't be able to board
without being spotted.

05:00.360 --> 05:02.431
And he's right between you
and the exit.

05:02.600 --> 05:05.638
Dex, I just heard them.
Our plane is boarding right now.

05:10.840 --> 05:14.311
Stay where you are. I'll call you back.
Okay.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.915
Hey. You want some Oreos?

05:17.080 --> 05:18.116
Yay!

05:18.320 --> 05:20.277
Come on.

05:24.120 --> 05:26.112
Why don't you grab something
for the flight?

05:26.280 --> 05:28.795
Nothing too big.
Okay.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.518
The storm is coming fast.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.793
<i>We'll now be boarding</i>

05:43.960 --> 05:45.394
<i>all passengers in business class.</i>

05:45.560 --> 05:49.076
<i>All passengers in business class,
please make your way toward the gate.</i>

05:52.360 --> 05:55.876
Hey, excuse me.
Hi. I have, uh, tickets on this flight.

05:56.080 --> 05:58.959
I'm a forensic analyst, Miami Metro.
Yes?

05:59.120 --> 06:03.000
I don't wanna tell you how
to do your job, but I just saw a guy

06:03.160 --> 06:06.517
drop that bag under that chair
and then just walk away.

06:06.720 --> 06:10.316
I thought he forgot it, but it really
looked like he left it there on purpose.

06:10.480 --> 06:11.834
Did you see where he went?

06:12.000 --> 06:14.469
Yeah, he's right over there,
on the phone.

06:15.840 --> 06:18.150
I know it's probably nothing,
but like they say:

06:18.320 --> 06:20.391
"If you see something,
say something."

06:20.560 --> 06:22.153
Thanks.

06:22.360 --> 06:24.317
Security, this is Casey
at Gate 211.

06:24.480 --> 06:27.439
There's a Caucasian male
who just came in with a backpack...

06:27.600 --> 06:30.320
Deputy marshal, it's Elway again.
I'm still at the airport.

06:30.480 --> 06:33.120
I still think Hannah McKay's trying
to leave the country.

06:33.280 --> 06:35.158
Call me as soon as you can.
Thank you.

06:35.600 --> 06:39.514
Sir. Airport security.
Need you to come with us, please.

06:39.680 --> 06:42.354
What? What happened?
Just gotta ask you a few questions.

06:42.520 --> 06:46.275
What is this about? I'll miss my flight.
Sir, I need you to do what I ask.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.874
This way.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.600
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

06:52.960 --> 06:55.031
Hey.
Hey, the coast is clear.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.190
<i>Elway's gone.</i>
Okay.

06:56.360 --> 06:58.033
<i>Due to a security concern...</i>

06:58.200 --> 07:00.032
Let's go see Hannah.

07:00.200 --> 07:02.112
<i>it is necessary at this time</i>

07:02.280 --> 07:04.636
<i>for all passengers
to exit the boarding area...</i>

07:04.800 --> 07:06.678
Clear this area right now.

07:13.160 --> 07:16.232
What did you do?
Put Elway on the no-fly list.

07:16.880 --> 07:19.395
Unfortunately,
now we're not flying either.

07:19.560 --> 07:20.880
Come on, bud.

07:29.520 --> 07:31.751
All right, let's move her.

07:32.360 --> 07:35.194
Stabbed in the heart. Pretty quick.
Unh.

07:35.360 --> 07:39.274
His gun is missing too.
We can assume Saxon still has it.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.310
I'm calling your brother.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.592
No, he's leaving with Harrison.
If you tell him, he'll stay.

07:44.760 --> 07:46.194
Deb--
I swear to God,

07:46.400 --> 07:48.631
I'm not getting on that ambulance
if you call.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.154
Okay.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.310
Can I ride with you to the hospital?
No problem.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.676
Do not argue with me.
I'm in the ambulance.

07:55.840 --> 07:58.435
You're such a fucking asshole.
Yeah, he signed it.

07:58.600 --> 08:01.718
I'll meet you at the hospital.
I'm right behind you.

08:14.680 --> 08:17.115
Miami Central,
this is Rescue 6 for transport...

08:18.640 --> 08:21.997
You're all right.
Hurts like a motherfucker.

08:22.160 --> 08:23.674
Ohh...

08:24.240 --> 08:27.790
You know, I really hate getting shot.
You need to stop that.

08:27.960 --> 08:29.440
Unh.

08:32.840 --> 08:35.514
I really thought that was it.
I thought I was gonna die, heh.

08:35.679 --> 08:37.399
No. You're gonna live forever.

08:40.480 --> 08:42.631
I thought maybe I was
getting what I deserved.

08:42.799 --> 08:44.792
What you deserve?

08:45.000 --> 08:47.231
Why would you think that?

08:53.840 --> 08:56.480
I've done shit I'm not proud of.

08:58.480 --> 09:00.472
Stuff I can't take back.

09:00.680 --> 09:02.876
Think I haven't done shit
I'm not proud of?

09:03.040 --> 09:04.838
No.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.399
It's not the same.

09:08.560 --> 09:11.075
I know.
You went through a bad time.

09:11.240 --> 09:15.439
But I fucked up too, Deb. A lot.

09:17.760 --> 09:20.673
But I think we get
to make up for it, you know?

09:22.800 --> 09:24.120
How?

09:24.280 --> 09:29.036
You do enough good in the world,
it sort of cancels out the bad.

09:29.720 --> 09:33.680
I think I would need to save
a busload of nuns or something.

09:33.880 --> 09:35.758
You're a good person.

09:35.920 --> 09:37.832
A lot better than most.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.673
Now that you're back on the force,

09:39.840 --> 09:42.400
you're gonna have a million chances
to do good.

09:42.600 --> 09:45.877
Maybe even save
that busload of nuns.

09:46.600 --> 09:49.752
If they're like the ones
I had in school, let them go.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.879
Come here.

09:55.960 --> 09:57.440
Hey.

09:57.920 --> 09:59.912
I'm gonna be right here, okay?

10:00.120 --> 10:02.715
We both are.
Her vitals are stable.

10:02.880 --> 10:05.349
Let's get her into surgery.
I love you, Joey.

10:06.320 --> 10:08.073
What's that?

10:15.840 --> 10:17.320
So?

10:17.480 --> 10:20.120
She's on her way to surgery now.
She took one in the gut.

10:20.280 --> 10:22.397
We don't know how bad it is yet.

10:22.600 --> 10:25.115
Where's Dexter?
Deb asked us not to call him.

10:25.280 --> 10:27.112
She what?
He's on a trip with Harrison.

10:27.280 --> 10:29.590
She didn't wanna worry him.
But he's gotta know.

10:29.760 --> 10:31.240
Damn right he's gotta know.

10:35.080 --> 10:37.549
<i>Due to a possible security concern,</i>

10:37.720 --> 10:38.995
<i>we are evacuating the terminal.</i>

10:44.760 --> 10:46.797
It's Matthews.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.036
Hello?

10:48.200 --> 10:51.398
<i>Dexter, Saxon escaped
after shooting Debra.</i>

10:52.360 --> 10:56.036
No. Well, thank you for telling me.
I'll be right there.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.758
What's wrong?

10:58.920 --> 11:00.798
It's Debra.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.440
What?

11:02.960 --> 11:04.679
Come on, bud.

11:07.160 --> 11:09.231
Saxon shot her and got away.

11:11.040 --> 11:13.032
Is she okay?

11:13.680 --> 11:17.310
She's in the hospital
getting ready to go into surgery.

11:17.480 --> 11:19.870
Is Aunt Deb sick?
Just a little.

11:20.040 --> 11:22.157
But the doctors are
fixing her up right now.

11:22.320 --> 11:24.551
You need to go to her.

11:25.480 --> 11:27.551
I'll take you back to the hotel.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.837
We should fly
into a different country.

11:30.040 --> 11:31.713
They're only gonna
hold Elway so long.

11:31.920 --> 11:35.231
He's gonna hit all the flights to Rio.
There may not be more flights.

11:35.400 --> 11:38.199
I heard they were gonna close
the airport to wait out the storm.

11:38.360 --> 11:40.875
Leave from another city.
See what you can find online.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.032
What about you?
I'll join you when I can.

11:43.200 --> 11:46.034
But--
Don't worry. We'll make this work.

11:56.120 --> 11:58.680
One bag of ice
and one gallon of water.

11:58.840 --> 12:01.435
- Can I get one more?
- Only one bag.

12:26.960 --> 12:30.795
Hi, Jamie.
Hey, Harrison.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.156
So tell me
all about your adventures...

12:33.320 --> 12:35.960
How is she?
Still in surgery.

12:36.720 --> 12:40.680
Yeah, we weren't able to speak
to the doctor before she went in.

12:41.280 --> 12:44.910
Your sister's tough.
Just like your old man was.

12:45.080 --> 12:47.470
Yeah, Dex.
She's gonna pull through.

12:50.960 --> 12:52.155
<i>Due to severe weather...</i>

12:52.320 --> 12:54.551
<i>This is Deputy U.S. Marshal Clayton.</i>

12:54.720 --> 12:56.074
<i>Please leave
your name and number.</i>

12:56.240 --> 12:58.357
Clayton, it's Elway. Again.

12:58.520 --> 13:01.957
I don't know where you are, but I'll
tell you this: McKay's still in town.

13:02.120 --> 13:05.397
With the flights cancelled, I'm sure
she's looking for another way out.

13:05.560 --> 13:08.792
I put the word out to my contacts,
and with what I pay these people,

13:08.960 --> 13:11.839
if she walks through a hotel,
a car-rental agency, a bus,

13:12.000 --> 13:14.117
I'm gonna hear about that shit.

13:14.800 --> 13:18.157
All right. I'll try you at your field office,
see if I can get you there.

13:24.080 --> 13:26.549
<i>U.S. Marshals Service.
How may I direct your call?</i>

13:26.720 --> 13:28.234
Yeah, this is Jacob Elway.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.551
I've been working
with Deputy Marshal Clayton.

13:30.720 --> 13:33.758
I've been trying like hell--
<i>I guess you haven't heard the news.</i>

13:33.920 --> 13:36.640
What?
<i>Clayton was involved in a shooting.</i>

13:36.800 --> 13:39.031
<i>I'm afraid he was killed
in the line of duty.</i>

13:54.840 --> 13:56.479
Why aren't you in Argentina?

13:59.120 --> 14:01.032
Why do you think?

14:04.520 --> 14:08.912
I told them not to call you.
Well, I'm glad they did.

14:14.080 --> 14:17.710
How come we never went hiking
when we were kids?

14:17.880 --> 14:19.758
Hiking?

14:20.760 --> 14:22.877
Climbing...

14:24.560 --> 14:26.517
mountains.

14:27.080 --> 14:28.753
Hiking.
I don't know.

14:28.920 --> 14:31.640
Because it's hard to find
a mountain in Florida?

14:35.280 --> 14:38.751
There are mountains
in South America.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.837
All over the place.

14:45.080 --> 14:47.879
Why are you looking at me
like that?

14:53.480 --> 14:55.631
Or is that just your face?

14:58.400 --> 15:01.552
I should never have
left Saxon alive.

15:02.080 --> 15:03.958
It's not your fault.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.757
Clayton fucked everything up.

15:09.920 --> 15:11.752
Bad luck.

15:11.920 --> 15:14.196
No, it's more than that.

15:14.840 --> 15:17.639
Ever since you found out
who I am...

15:26.200 --> 15:28.760
I've screwed up your life, Deb.

15:28.920 --> 15:32.709
It's not yours to screw up, Dexter.

15:34.120 --> 15:37.670
I am responsible for my life.
Do you hear me?

15:40.160 --> 15:42.994
I don't want you to feel guilty
about this.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.720
I don't want you to feel guilty
about anything. You hear me?

15:49.840 --> 15:54.153
You were meant to be happy,
so you need to go fucking be happy.

15:55.880 --> 15:57.553
Okay.

15:58.840 --> 16:00.991
Hello there.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.880
Dr. Kruper.
Dexter. I'm Debra's brother.

16:04.040 --> 16:05.440
Oh, nice to meet you.

16:06.200 --> 16:08.635
Okay, I'm just gonna
check your stomach.

16:10.440 --> 16:13.478
So how are you feeling
otherwise?

16:13.640 --> 16:15.677
I wanna go hiking.

16:15.840 --> 16:17.160
I wouldn't recommend that

16:17.320 --> 16:19.312
for at least a few hours.

16:19.840 --> 16:21.115
How is she?

16:21.280 --> 16:23.715
That bullet bounced around
quite a bit.

16:23.920 --> 16:26.151
But it missed
hitting anything important.

16:26.320 --> 16:27.595
You are very lucky.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.639
So she's gonna be all right?

16:29.840 --> 16:33.231
There is a lot of recovery time ahead.

16:33.880 --> 16:37.351
But I'd say we're looking pretty good.
I'm optimistic.

16:37.840 --> 16:39.399
Thank you.
Mm-hm.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.239
I bet Hannah loves Argentina.

16:51.960 --> 16:54.475
Pretty blond, lots of attention.

16:54.640 --> 16:56.393
Just her thing.

16:57.200 --> 16:59.669
Hannah didn't make the flight.

17:00.720 --> 17:04.349
Elway was there,
and we had to lose him.

17:06.079 --> 17:08.720
That's my fault, Dex.
I put him on her.

17:08.920 --> 17:12.152
That rat-face fuck.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.038
I'm sorry.
No, don't start blaming yourself.

17:16.200 --> 17:19.671
Coming from
Mr. "I screwed up your life, Deb."

17:23.800 --> 17:27.760
I need to find another way
for Hannah to get out of the country.

17:31.120 --> 17:33.351
I'm thinking of sending Harrison
with her now

17:33.520 --> 17:35.716
and meeting up with them
after you get out

17:35.880 --> 17:38.315
and Saxon is taken care of.

17:39.040 --> 17:42.238
You heard the doctor. I'm fine.
You should go. We'll get Saxon.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.392
No.
Dex, we'll get him.

17:44.560 --> 17:47.120
Your life is waiting on you.
You should leave.

17:47.640 --> 17:48.756
Deb...

17:48.960 --> 17:51.520
The next word
I wanna hear you say is "goodbye."

17:54.280 --> 17:58.991
Say it already, or I'll crawl out
of this bed and kick your fucking ass.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.358
Goodbye.

18:04.920 --> 18:06.832
I'll see you soon.

18:24.520 --> 18:28.196
How's Aunt Deb? Can I see her?
Oh, she needs to rest.

18:28.360 --> 18:31.398
But she's gonna come visit us
real soon.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.835
Hey, did you know that this
is the hospital where you were born?

18:38.880 --> 18:40.997
Really?
Yeah. Right down there.

18:41.160 --> 18:43.629
It was the first time I saw you.

18:44.720 --> 18:46.837
I was with Aunt Deb.

18:51.440 --> 18:53.909
Holy fucking shit.
There's another Morgan now.

18:54.080 --> 18:57.152
Yeah.
Congratulations.

18:57.360 --> 18:58.510
You're a father.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.720
Yeah, and you're an aunt.
Jesus.

19:01.880 --> 19:03.473
Did you and Rita land
on a name yet?

19:03.640 --> 19:04.756
Harrison.

19:06.880 --> 19:09.554
Dad would love that. Harrison.

19:10.720 --> 19:13.030
I wanna hold him.

19:16.640 --> 19:19.235
Which one is yours?
I, um...

19:19.400 --> 19:21.312
That's your son.

19:28.280 --> 19:30.476
Do you wanna hold him?
Yeah, I wanna hold him.

19:30.640 --> 19:31.869
He's sleeping.
Let him sleep.

19:32.040 --> 19:34.509
He has his whole fucking life
to sleep.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.960
He's so small.
Don't worry. He'll grow.

19:43.960 --> 19:46.236
How does it feel to be a father?

19:46.400 --> 19:48.357
I have no idea.
Heh.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.955
Everything's gonna be different now.

19:51.560 --> 19:53.438
I know.

20:00.120 --> 20:01.759
Hey, thanks for your call.

20:01.920 --> 20:03.673
No problem.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.597
How's Debra?
The doctor's optimistic.

20:07.760 --> 20:09.797
That's good to hear.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.838
Dexter, if there's anything
I can do...

20:12.000 --> 20:16.153
Well, I'm probably being paranoid,
but Saxon is still out there.

20:16.360 --> 20:18.477
Think you could put a couple unis
on her room?

20:18.640 --> 20:19.756
I'm already on it.

20:21.920 --> 20:23.070
Thanks.
No problem.

20:26.760 --> 20:30.390
Hey. Hey, I just heard about Deb.
What happened?

20:30.560 --> 20:33.394
Uh, it's a long story.
I don't really have time to go into it.

20:33.560 --> 20:36.029
In a hurry to get back
to Hannah McKay?

20:36.480 --> 20:39.473
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's why Clayton was following Deb.

20:39.640 --> 20:42.280
Figured she was helping you
and Hannah leave the country.

20:42.440 --> 20:44.557
You're partially responsible
for his death.

20:44.760 --> 20:48.356
Just stay away from me.
Storm's coming, buddy.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.349
And it's gonna be real hard
to find a way out.

20:54.160 --> 20:56.231
Don't go down with her,
Dexter.

20:58.280 --> 20:59.680
Son of a bitch.

21:04.240 --> 21:06.675
<i>The National Hurricane Centre
is reporting</i>

21:06.840 --> 21:08.832
<i>that Laura is now just east
of Cuba</i>

21:09.000 --> 21:11.356
<i>with sustained winds
topping 100 miles per hour.</i>

21:11.520 --> 21:15.673
<i>If it keeps on this current course,
it could hit the Keys by sundown.</i>

21:18.880 --> 21:20.075
Shh. It's okay.

21:20.240 --> 21:22.800
<i>Hurricane Laura shows
no signs of slowing down.</i>

21:23.000 --> 21:25.390
Hey. It's okay. It's okay.

21:25.560 --> 21:26.596
Hey, we're closed.

21:26.800 --> 21:29.520
Only reason I'm here
is to keep the animals calm to--

21:29.720 --> 21:31.677
Stitch me up.

21:32.920 --> 21:34.593
Okay.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.400
Okay, I'll do whatever you need.

21:38.480 --> 21:40.551
Miami's entire coast
is being evacuated,

21:40.720 --> 21:44.270
so we can use the craziness to get
out of here without being spotted.

21:44.440 --> 21:47.638
They're lining up evacuation buses.
The bus?

21:47.800 --> 21:48.950
The highways are parking lots.

21:49.160 --> 21:50.480
Buses have their own lanes.

21:50.640 --> 21:54.236
We can take one all the way up
to Jacksonville and fly out from there.

21:55.280 --> 21:59.194
We'd better leave for the bus station
soon if we're gonna make it on time.

22:01.880 --> 22:03.234
What is it?

22:03.400 --> 22:06.234
Nothing. It's a good plan.

22:08.120 --> 22:10.840
You're still worried
about Deb, aren't you?

22:12.240 --> 22:14.994
The doctor said
she's out of danger.

22:15.880 --> 22:17.997
Hey, we can, uh...

22:18.160 --> 22:21.232
We can stick around, you know,
ride out the storm here.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.113
It's not safe with Elway on the hunt.

22:23.320 --> 22:26.870
You need to get out of here,
the faster the better.

22:27.360 --> 22:29.875
Well, I could leave now
and you could meet me there.

22:30.040 --> 22:32.555
I could even take
Harrison with me.

22:34.800 --> 22:37.872
Or I could, um, go alone.

22:38.080 --> 22:40.037
I have no problem
with you taking Harrison.

22:40.200 --> 22:42.760
I'd be happy to know
that he's with you.

22:44.440 --> 22:47.114
It's that I don't wanna
lose you again.

22:47.840 --> 22:50.878
Even if it's just
for a couple of days.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.310
<i>--as well as Cuba
and Grand Cayman Island.</i>

22:58.520 --> 23:01.160
<i>We're staying with you through
the morning and into the night...</i>

23:01.320 --> 23:02.959
Hurry up.

23:03.120 --> 23:05.112
<i>Tropical Storm Laura
is picking up speed...</i>

23:05.320 --> 23:07.118
Almost finished.

23:07.320 --> 23:08.390
One more stitch.

23:08.560 --> 23:11.758
<i>The storm is threatening the coast
sometime in the next few days,</i>

23:11.920 --> 23:13.991
<i>according to
the National Hurricane Centre.</i>

23:14.200 --> 23:16.874
<i>Many local residents are
already preparing for the storm.</i>

23:17.080 --> 23:18.196
<i>As the storm comes in,</i>

23:18.360 --> 23:21.956
<i>it's important that people stay
in their homes and off the highways.</i>

23:22.120 --> 23:24.271
<i>There's going to be a lot of wind
and rain.</i>

23:24.440 --> 23:27.194
<i>It's going to be over the next few...</i>
Please.

23:27.360 --> 23:30.398
Just go.
I won't say anything to anyone.

23:30.560 --> 23:34.873
<i>--for this special report about
one of Miami's finest, Debra Morgan.</i>

23:35.040 --> 23:37.350
That's her.
<i>I'm here at Miami Central Hospital,</i>

<i>where a detective
with Miami Metro</i>

23:39.560 --> 23:42.120
<i>is recovering from surgery

23:42.280 --> 23:44.875
<i>We have learned that
a deputy marshal died on the scene.</i>

<i>The suspect, Oliver Saxon,

23:50.400 --> 23:52.198
<i>If you have any information about...</i>

23:52.360 --> 23:54.955
Get your car keys.
We're taking a drive.

23:55.160 --> 23:56.674
Can't you just let me go?

23:56.840 --> 23:58.911
Do what I said,

23:59.120 --> 24:01.191
and you won't get hurt.

24:02.280 --> 24:04.795
<i>Mockingbird Bus 24
from Miami to Tallahassee...</i>

24:05.000 --> 24:07.151
All right, keep it moving.
No pushing.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.437
WOMAN
Oh, no, it's okay.

24:13.680 --> 24:15.160
Wait.

24:15.720 --> 24:17.313
Come here.

24:17.480 --> 24:19.756
All right, everyone,
please keep moving the line.

24:19.920 --> 24:23.311
It's Saxon. He's still out there.
I can't leave until he's caught,

24:23.520 --> 24:25.751
until Debra is safe.

24:25.920 --> 24:27.832
I'm sorry.
You need to get back in line.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.719
It's okay. I understand.

24:31.120 --> 24:35.194
Here. Take Harrison.
I'll meet you down there.

24:36.200 --> 24:38.874
You sure?
Yeah. He'll be safer with you.

24:40.360 --> 24:44.912
Take this. It's just water,
snacks. A few essentials.

24:46.760 --> 24:50.470
Call me from the airport as soon as
you know that you made your flight.

24:51.880 --> 24:53.155
I will.

24:53.320 --> 24:55.915
<i>No one will be allowed
to board without a ticket.</i>

24:56.080 --> 24:58.436
Harrison, you're gonna leave
with Hannah.

24:58.640 --> 25:01.792
You're not coming with us?
No, of course I am.

25:01.960 --> 25:04.714
I just forgot a few things
I need to take care of.

25:04.880 --> 25:07.998
As soon as I do,
I'll meet you there, I promise.

25:09.040 --> 25:11.350
I'm gonna miss you.

25:12.800 --> 25:15.076
It's just for a little while.
It'll be fun.

25:15.280 --> 25:19.433
We're all going to this cool place,
and you're gonna get there first, okay?

25:19.600 --> 25:23.071
Now, I want you to mind Hannah.
You do what she says.

25:27.880 --> 25:31.157
You know what, Daddy?
What?

25:32.000 --> 25:34.117
I love Hannah.

25:37.640 --> 25:39.438
So do I.

25:44.280 --> 25:46.112
I'll see you in Buenos Aires.

25:46.760 --> 25:48.035
We'll be waiting.

25:54.480 --> 25:56.597
<i>This is the final boarding call</i>

25:56.760 --> 26:00.117
<i>for Mockingbird Bus 24 to Tallahassee.</i>

Come on, Harrison.

26:24.560 --> 26:27.712
<i>I'll check on Deb,
and then I'll deal with Saxon.</i>

26:39.360 --> 26:40.953
This is the hospital.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.390
I've done everything
you've asked.

26:44.560 --> 26:46.233
I just wanna go home.

26:47.680 --> 26:49.672
So this is it.

26:50.360 --> 26:53.990
I promise,
I won't say a word to anyone.

26:54.160 --> 26:56.038
No, I know.

27:06.160 --> 27:08.516
We need a doctor over here!

27:13.040 --> 27:14.520
Let me get that.

27:18.480 --> 27:20.233
He's choking.
I need a suction canister.

27:20.400 --> 27:21.675
Right away.

27:29.200 --> 27:31.840
- Doctor?
- Jesus.

27:32.040 --> 27:34.600
His tongue, it's been cut out.
Let's get him to the OR.

27:35.160 --> 27:37.959
My God, why would anyone
cut his tongue out?

27:39.960 --> 27:43.954
<i>All eyes on the victim.
The perfect distraction.</i>

27:44.120 --> 27:45.873
<i>Saxon.</i>

27:48.160 --> 27:50.038
<i>In order to conserve power,</i>

27:50.200 --> 27:51.600
<i>the south wing has been closed.</i>

27:51.760 --> 27:53.638
<i>At this time, we ask all visitors</i>

27:53.800 --> 27:56.679
<i>to make their way towards the exit
in the north wing.</i>

27:56.840 --> 28:00.151
<i>All surgical staff are to report
to their current assignments.</i>

28:23.800 --> 28:25.553
Drop it.

28:25.760 --> 28:27.080
Drop it.

28:31.920 --> 28:33.639
We got this, Dex.

28:56.360 --> 28:57.953
Quinn?

28:59.280 --> 29:01.192
Dex, I...

29:01.360 --> 29:04.831
Where's Deb?
I don't know. Something went wrong.

29:05.000 --> 29:09.279
There was a problem,
and they rushed her to the ICU.

29:10.800 --> 29:11.836
What happened?

29:12.600 --> 29:14.637
They're working on her now. Um...

29:14.800 --> 29:16.029
She stopped breathing.

29:28.560 --> 29:32.349
Mr. Morgan, I'm afraid
I don't have good news.

29:32.520 --> 29:35.160
There were complications.

29:36.960 --> 29:39.156
What kind of complications?

29:39.320 --> 29:42.916
We think a clot formed during surgery
that triggered a major stroke.

29:43.080 --> 29:45.754
Debra's brain was deprived
of oxygen for a period of time.

29:45.920 --> 29:48.151
What do you mean?
You said she was gonna be fine.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.596
I had hoped so.

29:50.760 --> 29:52.877
I'm very sorry.

29:56.520 --> 29:57.954
Is she going to recover?

29:58.120 --> 30:00.680
It's possible that
she could breathe on her own,

30:00.840 --> 30:03.480
but she won't be able to eat
without a feeding tube,

30:03.640 --> 30:08.556
and according to the brain scans,
she won't be able to think, reason,

30:08.720 --> 30:11.394
or even know that you're there.

30:12.720 --> 30:16.873
Now, we've intubated her, and
I've lowered her body temperature

30:17.080 --> 30:20.756
so that we can preserve as much
brain function as possible.

30:21.760 --> 30:25.071
You don't know Deb. She'll--
She'll pull through this.

30:25.240 --> 30:28.438
You hear about
miracles all the time.

30:28.600 --> 30:33.595
Well, that's just it, I'm afraid.
It would be a miracle.

30:37.480 --> 30:40.234
I've never seen a miracle.

30:43.440 --> 30:46.797
Hello, Harrison.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.400
Wow.

30:50.160 --> 30:52.197
He's so fucking small.

30:57.600 --> 31:00.752
I'll have to watch what I say
around you, little man. Heh.

31:02.360 --> 31:04.716
Don't you wanna
hold your son?

31:07.520 --> 31:09.034
You won't break him.
Heh.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.839
Okay.

31:17.320 --> 31:19.277
Talk to him.

31:22.640 --> 31:24.871
Hello, Harrison.

31:27.520 --> 31:29.671
See? He knows you.

31:31.800 --> 31:34.713
I don't know how to do this.
Just keep his head up.

31:34.880 --> 31:36.837
No, I mean everything.

31:37.040 --> 31:39.475
How to be a father,
how to take care of him.

31:39.640 --> 31:42.314
You'll be great.
How do you know?

31:42.480 --> 31:44.711
Because you've always
taken care of me.

31:44.920 --> 31:46.195
I have?

31:46.360 --> 31:48.636
Ever since we were little.

31:49.760 --> 31:51.877
Don't you remember
the monsters?

31:53.240 --> 31:54.356
Uh, no.

31:54.520 --> 31:57.991
Every time Mom turned off the lights,
they'd be running all over the walls.

31:58.160 --> 31:59.640
I couldn't fucking go to sleep.

31:59.800 --> 32:01.996
I thought they were gonna
eat me or something.

32:02.160 --> 32:05.437
I don't remember.
They were the shadows.

32:06.600 --> 32:09.160
You came in and explained it
in your dorky little voice.

32:09.360 --> 32:12.512
"Oh, it's just the absence
of light, Deb." Heh.

32:14.160 --> 32:17.517
I don't even know
why I remember that, but I do.

32:18.800 --> 32:24.114
And even then, you stayed in my room
and slept on the floor by my bed.

32:26.240 --> 32:28.391
You made me feel so fucking safe.

32:30.440 --> 32:33.558
You were always taking care of me.
You're gonna be a great father,

32:33.760 --> 32:36.594
because you've always been
a great big brother.

32:36.760 --> 32:38.717
You really believe that?

32:38.880 --> 32:41.076
With all my heart.

32:49.920 --> 32:52.480
<i>You were so wrong, Deb.</i>

33:01.240 --> 33:03.277
Tell me about Argentina.

33:04.760 --> 33:09.152
Well, uh, they have their own
special kind of cowboys.

33:09.320 --> 33:12.791
They're called gauchos.
Maybe you'll get to meet one.

33:12.960 --> 33:15.077
You know what else they have?

33:15.240 --> 33:17.630
Penguins.
I like penguins.

33:17.800 --> 33:18.995
They're not just in a zoo.

33:19.160 --> 33:21.675
They're wild ones,
kind of roaming around

33:21.840 --> 33:26.710
because Argentina is close
to the South Pole,

33:26.880 --> 33:30.715
which is where Santa Claus
has his summer home, and...

33:33.480 --> 33:37.030
And because he's on vacation,
he's always in a good mood,

33:37.240 --> 33:39.994
so he says yes to everything.

33:40.200 --> 33:42.954
Who knew you'd be
so good with kids, huh?

33:43.640 --> 33:45.359
How did you find me?

33:45.520 --> 33:48.035
One of my contacts
finally came through.

33:48.800 --> 33:52.316
Look, let's be civil about this, all right?
No need to upset Harrison.

33:53.600 --> 33:56.240
All right, please take your seats.
We're pulling out now.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.073
Next stop, Daytona.

34:00.360 --> 34:02.591
So this is what's gonna happen.

34:03.160 --> 34:05.800
We're gonna sit here quietly
until we get to Daytona.

34:05.960 --> 34:08.714
Then we're gonna
very calmly get off the bus.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.156
I'm gonna drive us
to the marshals field office,

34:11.360 --> 34:15.400
turn you in and hand Harrison over
to Child Protective Services.

34:16.760 --> 34:22.630
And I'm gonna collect what's turning
out to be a very hard-earned reward.

34:33.239 --> 34:36.870
Dex, we're gonna nail
this asshole to the wall,

34:37.040 --> 34:39.077
I promise you.

34:39.520 --> 34:40.556
For Deb.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.275
Oliver Saxon.

34:47.960 --> 34:52.000
Or would you prefer to be called
by your given name, Daniel Vogel?

34:54.120 --> 34:56.510
You know, there are
several ways we can do this.

34:56.679 --> 34:59.320
Given that we have footage
of you killing other people,

34:59.480 --> 35:02.234
it would be in your best interest
to cooperate.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.312
It's up to my lawyer
how cooperative I am.

35:04.480 --> 35:06.517
Are you sure?
Because if you have any hope

35:06.680 --> 35:08.319
of staying out of the electric chair,

35:08.480 --> 35:10.199
you should
probably start talking.

35:10.360 --> 35:11.589
Just fucking admit it.

35:11.760 --> 35:14.434
You killed Cassie,
you killed Clayton,

35:15.320 --> 35:16.515
and you shot Deb.

35:18.080 --> 35:19.309
How did you hurt your arm?

35:20.520 --> 35:22.716
This? It's just a scratch.

35:23.160 --> 35:24.310
No.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.354
Deb's a good shot.

35:28.600 --> 35:29.636
Who's Deb?

35:31.880 --> 35:32.870
Fuck you!

35:33.040 --> 35:36.033
You fucking shot her!
And you left her there to die!

35:36.200 --> 35:38.715
Just like you killed your mother
and left her to die,

35:38.880 --> 35:40.280
you fucking piece of shit!

35:40.440 --> 35:41.794
Quinn. Out.

35:45.440 --> 35:49.036
I'd like to, uh, speak
to my attorney, please.

35:58.960 --> 36:00.997
You know,
he was right about one thing.

36:02.760 --> 36:05.070
You are a fucking piece of shit.

36:07.160 --> 36:10.676
<i>Batista and Quinn will be able
to make a case against Saxon.</i>

36:10.840 --> 36:16.711
<i>I could leave now for Argentina
and let the state of Florida kill him.</i>

36:17.440 --> 36:20.592
Folks, we will be arriving
at the Daytona station momentarily.

36:20.760 --> 36:23.912
After a short stop,
we will proceed on to Tallahassee.

36:24.080 --> 36:26.595
Anyone making a connection
to Jacksonville

36:26.760 --> 36:30.356
should disembark
and proceed to Boarding Bay 3.

36:30.520 --> 36:31.556
Hey, hey.

36:31.720 --> 36:33.916
I'm just getting some tea.

36:47.040 --> 36:49.714
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you want some?

36:52.920 --> 36:55.833
How stupid do you think I am?

37:00.120 --> 37:01.520
Here's what's gonna happen.

37:01.680 --> 37:05.390
The horse tranquilliser I just gave you
is gonna kick in in eight seconds.

37:05.560 --> 37:08.029
You're gonna fall asleep
and wake up in Tallahassee

37:08.240 --> 37:11.358
with a slight headache,
feeling humiliated and cranky.

37:12.800 --> 37:14.200
Come on, sweetie.

37:15.520 --> 37:17.398
It's time to go. Let's go.

37:17.560 --> 37:19.233
Come on.

37:29.960 --> 37:34.000
Hi. I'm here to do a GSR test
on Oliver Saxon?

37:34.160 --> 37:36.038
Sign in, please.

37:40.840 --> 37:43.514
Would you like an officer with you?
No, I'm good.

37:43.680 --> 37:47.276
Okay. Hit this button if you need us.
Got it.

38:35.400 --> 38:38.313
I wish I could blame you
for everything.

38:39.920 --> 38:42.640
For what you did to my sister.

38:44.360 --> 38:47.080
But I know it's all my fault.

38:51.080 --> 38:52.400
Should have walked away.

38:55.040 --> 38:57.555
You know, what you've actually done
is opened my eyes.

39:00.440 --> 39:02.875
Forced me to look at myself.

39:04.160 --> 39:05.196
And what do you see?

39:07.600 --> 39:10.672
A trail of blood and body parts.

39:13.560 --> 39:15.233
What a pretty picture.

39:20.040 --> 39:24.034
In one sharp moment,
you took away

39:24.200 --> 39:27.113
this foolish dream
that I could have a happy life.

39:29.040 --> 39:31.111
Is that why you're here?

39:31.800 --> 39:32.870
To tell me all this?

39:33.040 --> 39:35.714
No, I'm here to kill you with that pen.

40:15.680 --> 40:18.036
In here.
You all right?

40:22.000 --> 40:24.117
He tried to kill me.

40:52.880 --> 40:54.678
Dexter...

40:55.720 --> 40:56.756
help me out here.

40:56.920 --> 41:00.914
What were you doing with Saxon?
I went in to do a GSR test.

41:01.080 --> 41:04.551
But you don't even work here anymore.
How are we gonna explain this?

41:04.720 --> 41:07.918
I'm officially here
till the end of the week.

41:09.160 --> 41:12.232
Okay, but why would you
personally do this test?

41:12.720 --> 41:14.200
After what he did to Deb--

41:14.360 --> 41:17.956
It's exactly because of what he did
to Deb that I went in there.

41:18.160 --> 41:21.358
I wanted to make sure everything
was handled perfectly, by the book,

41:21.520 --> 41:23.193
no mistakes.

41:26.480 --> 41:29.154
And I wanted to look him in the eye.

41:37.920 --> 41:39.673
Okay.

41:39.840 --> 41:41.194
I get that.

41:42.560 --> 41:44.870
It's obviously self-defence.

41:48.320 --> 41:49.913
Yeah.

41:51.440 --> 41:53.193
We got everything we need.

41:55.640 --> 41:57.313
I'm glad he's dead.

41:57.480 --> 41:59.790
I wish I could have done it myself.

42:07.960 --> 42:09.030
You should go, Dex.

42:09.200 --> 42:11.635
I know that you have
a lot to deal with.

42:14.600 --> 42:16.193
Yes.

42:18.960 --> 42:20.440
Hey.

42:24.160 --> 42:25.992
I'm praying for her.

42:36.520 --> 42:39.160
<i>As much as I may have
pretended otherwise,</i>

42:39.320 --> 42:42.950
<i>for so long, all I wanted
was to be like other people,</i>

42:43.160 --> 42:45.675
<i>to feel what they felt.</i>

42:48.120 --> 42:51.192
<i>But now that I do,
I just want it to stop.</i>

43:26.720 --> 43:29.110
<i>Attention, all staff
and hospital personnel:</i>

43:29.280 --> 43:32.000
<i>The National Hurricane Centre
estimates the current...</i>

43:32.160 --> 43:34.994
Just so you know, patients
in the south wing are being moved.

43:35.160 --> 43:36.958
We have to consolidate
space and power.

43:37.120 --> 43:39.112
<i>--at 150 miles per hour.</i>

43:39.280 --> 43:42.432
<i>It has been elevated to Category 3.</i>

43:42.640 --> 43:46.270
<i>At this time, all staff must report
to their preassigned stations.</i>

44:09.800 --> 44:12.554
I would change everything
if I could.

44:21.920 --> 44:25.152
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

44:39.360 --> 44:41.795
But I can't leave you like this.

44:46.760 --> 44:48.399
I'm your big brother.

46:20.960 --> 46:23.031
I love you, Deb.

48:40.880 --> 48:43.714
<i>Dexter.</i>
Hey, where are you?

48:43.880 --> 48:46.520
At the airport, about to board.
We're gonna make it.

48:46.680 --> 48:48.433
That's great.

48:48.600 --> 48:50.353
<i>Where are you?</i>

48:50.520 --> 48:52.591
I'm still in Miami.

48:52.760 --> 48:54.433
But I'm gonna be leaving soon.

48:54.600 --> 48:56.671
<i>I can't believe
this is actually gonna happen.</i>

48:56.840 --> 48:59.435
<i>Once we get there,
we should start making our way south.</i>

48:59.600 --> 49:01.193
<i>They have 3000 miles of coastline.</i>

49:01.360 --> 49:04.592
We can just keep going
until we find the perfect spot,

49:04.760 --> 49:07.400
or maybe some penguins.

49:07.560 --> 49:08.880
That sounds great.

49:09.040 --> 49:13.159
I am so happy right now, Dex.

49:14.840 --> 49:18.231
Me too.
<i>Do you wanna talk to Harrison?</i>

49:18.720 --> 49:20.074
Please.

49:20.240 --> 49:21.640
<i>Okay, here.</i>

49:24.000 --> 49:26.799
Hi, Daddy.
<i>Hi, Harrison.</i>

49:26.960 --> 49:28.997
I just wanna tell you one last time
that I love you.

49:29.760 --> 49:31.319
I love you too.

49:32.040 --> 49:35.238
I want you to remember that
every single day until I see you again.

49:35.400 --> 49:36.880
Daddy loves you.

49:37.040 --> 49:39.316
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

51:34.640 --> 51:37.553
<i>I destroy everyone I love.</i>

51:38.360 --> 51:42.752
<i>And I can't let that happen to Hannah,
to Harrison.</i>

51:43.840 --> 51:46.912
<i>I have to protect them from me.</i>

52:02.120 --> 52:03.554
<i>Good morning, Miami.</i>

52:03.760 --> 52:06.195
<i>Hurricane Laura has passed.
Everything is going back to normal.</i>

52:06.360 --> 52:08.716
<i>There is no longer any threat.</i>

52:09.040 --> 52:11.874
<i>Hurricane Laura is slowly dissipating
over the Atlantic.</i>

52:12.040 --> 52:14.794
<i>The majority of destruction
is along the harbour.</i>

52:14.960 --> 52:17.680
<i>There have been some reports...
The cleanup has begun</i>

52:17.840 --> 52:19.479
<i>as the city returns to normal,</i>

52:19.640 --> 52:22.633
<i>with Coast Guard teams going
as far north as Daytona Beach...</i>

52:22.800 --> 52:25.395
<i>Cutter 6, go ahead
and turn to your 1 o'clock.</i>

52:25.560 --> 52:27.597
<i>There's something there.
I can't make it out.</i>

52:28.160 --> 52:30.197
<i>We're stopping in five seconds.</i>

52:30.360 --> 52:32.920
<i>- Okay, I think we got a visual.
- Copy that.</i>

52:33.080 --> 52:34.992
<i>Turning northwest.</i>

52:37.680 --> 52:39.080
<i>We've surveyed the wreckage.</i>

52:39.240 --> 52:41.709
<i>There doesn't appear
to be any survivors.</i>

52:41.880 --> 52:43.678
<i>We're heading back.</i>

52:49.000 --> 52:51.469
Batista.
<i>This is the U.S. Coast Guard.</i>

52:51.640 --> 52:54.951
<i>We just wanted to call and report
the wreckage of Dexter Morgan's boat.</i>

52:55.120 --> 52:56.873
Dexter?

53:30.960 --> 53:33.680
Hey, how about we go
get some ice cream, yeah?

53:33.840 --> 53:35.240
Okay.
Yeah. Come on.
