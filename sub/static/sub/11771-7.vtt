Puffy shirt,
puffy shirt.

00:16.333 --> 00:19.633
( laughing )

00:21.467 --> 00:26.967
Uh, can you spare a little
change for an old buccaneer ?

00:27.000 --> 00:29.300
You know, it's really
not a bad looking shirt.

00:31.500 --> 00:33.267
GOOD SHOW.
ALRIGHT, GOOD SHOW.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.900
( phone ringing )
OH, JESUS.

00:35.933 --> 00:37.833
DON'T ANSWER IT, I'M,
I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO HER.

00:37.867 --> 00:41.233
WELL, WHY DOES SHE HAVE
TO CALL AFTER EVERY EPISODE ?

00:41.267 --> 00:43.233
OH, DON'T--
I'M NOT HERE.

00:43.267 --> 00:44.333
HELLO ?

00:44.367 --> 00:46.133
HI, MARILYN.

00:46.167 --> 00:49.467
UH, YEAH,
WE JUST WATCHED IT.

00:49.500 --> 00:53.700
YEAH, I KNOW, IT'S...
IT WAS ONE OF THE GOOD ONES.

00:53.733 --> 00:58.033
UM, HE'S ACTUALLY,
HE'S UNAVAILABLE.

00:58.067 --> 00:59.400
MM-HMM.

00:59.433 --> 01:03.233
UH, OKAY, BYE.

01:03.267 --> 01:06.133
TELL HIM IT WAS ONE OF
MY FAVORITE EPISODES.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.500
IT MADE ME
LAUGH SO HARD.

01:08.533 --> 01:10.533
OH, MY GOD.
I SWEAR, IT GETS BETTER
EVERY TIME I SEE IT.

01:10.567 --> 01:13.300
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS WOMAN HAS
TO CALL AFTER EVERY SINGLE SHOW.

01:13.333 --> 01:17.967
EVERY, I MEAN, DOES IT
EVER END WITH THIS LADY ?

01:18.067 --> 01:19.400
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING TOMORROW ?

01:19.433 --> 01:21.867
I'M GETTING MY PHYSICAL
FOR THE PRODUCERS.

01:21.900 --> 01:23.567
CAN YOU DO ME
A FAVOR ?

01:23.600 --> 01:25.500
WILL YOU
PICK UP A, UM,

01:25.533 --> 01:27.633
A PRESENT FOR
THE DOOSENBURY'S
BABY SHOWER ?

01:27.667 --> 01:28.900

01:28.933 --> 01:31.067
YOU'RE GONNA BE RIGHT THERE,
THERE'S A TOY STORE RIGHT...

01:31.067 --> 01:33.500
YOU WOULD ENTRUST ME
WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT ?

01:33.533 --> 01:34.533
A GIFT
FOR A BABY ?

01:34.567 --> 01:37.233
JUST GET A,
A DOLL OR SOMETHING.

01:37.267 --> 01:40.867
SO YOU WANT ME TO GET
A DOLL FOR BETTY ?

01:40.900 --> 01:42.633
GET A DOLL
FOR BETTY.

01:42.667 --> 01:43.633
IT'S HER
BABY SHOWER.

01:43.667 --> 01:45.233
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
THE SURROGATE ?

01:45.267 --> 01:46.733
GET HER ANYTHING ?

01:46.767 --> 01:49.067
I DON'T THINK YOU NEED
TO WORRY ABOUT THE SURROGATE.

01:49.100 --> 01:50.633
WELL, I DON'T
KNOW ABOUT THAT.

01:50.667 --> 01:53.067
I THINK THE SURROGATE
IS A PERSON, TOO.

01:53.100 --> 01:54.400
SHE'S HAVING
THE BABY.

01:54.433 --> 01:56.900
THE SHOWER IS
FOR BETTY.

01:56.933 --> 01:58.133
SO SHE'S GONNA BE
OPENING HER PRESENTS,

01:58.167 --> 01:59.833
THE SURROGATE'S GONNA BE
STANDING THERE LIKE AN IDIOT,

01:59.867 --> 02:01.100
AND SHE HAS
NOTHING TO OPEN ?

02:01.133 --> 02:03.933
THE WHOLE THING'S, WHAT'S
THE SURROGATE ETIQUETTE ?

02:03.967 --> 02:06.633
OKAY, USE YOUR JUDGMENT,
WHEVER YOU THINK.

02:06.667 --> 02:09.167
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU
WANT TO DO, THAT'S FINE.

02:13.067 --> 02:14.900
HEY, CHARLIE,
WHAT'S GOING ON THERE ?

02:14.933 --> 02:16.067
H, WHAT ?

02:16.067 --> 02:17.267
WHAT ?
HUH ?

02:17.300 --> 02:19.167
COME ON, YOU KNOW
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

02:21.833 --> 02:24.167
BECAUSE THE DOG
BIT YOUR PENIS ?

02:24.200 --> 02:26.200
YES.

02:28.367 --> 02:30.500
AND SO YOU'RE...

02:30.533 --> 02:32.267
IT'S NOT READY,
I'M NOT READY.

02:32.300 --> 02:35.633
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY,
A COUPLE MORE DAYS.

02:48.567 --> 02:49.700
MR. DAVID ?

02:54.233 --> 02:57.733
CAN I MAKE
AN OBSERVATION ?

02:57.767 --> 02:59.733
THAT MAGAZINE
COLLECTION,

02:59.767 --> 03:01.733
YOU REALLY NEED TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

03:01.767 --> 03:05.533
I'M NOT COMPLAINING, I'M JUST,
JUST MAKING AN OBSERVATION.

03:05.567 --> 03:08.233
WELL, THE DOCTOR'S
READY TO SEE YOU.

03:08.267 --> 03:09.700
OKAY.

03:09.733 --> 03:11.933
JUST, YOU KNOW,
JUST FOR YOUR INFORMATION.

03:11.967 --> 03:13.167
F.Y.I.
KIND OF THING.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.800
IT'S RIGHT THAT WAY.
OKAY.

03:19.067 --> 03:20.567
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,

03:20.600 --> 03:22.700
STEALING YOUR MAGAZINES
FROM GARBAGE CANS ?

03:22.733 --> 03:25.100
I HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH A
COLLECTION OF SHIT IN MY LIFE.

ALRIGHT, WE HAVE--

03:26.167 --> 03:28.233
THEY'RE ALL FOUR YEARS OLD,
THOSE THINGS.

03:28.267 --> 03:29.867
WE HAVE OTHER THINGS
THAT WE THINK ABOUT

03:29.900 --> 03:30.967
OTHER THAN
THE MAGAZINES,

03:31.067 --> 03:32.433
LIKE GIVING PEOPLE
MEDICAL ASSISTANCE.

03:32.467 --> 03:35.667
LADIES HOME JOURNAL
FROM, FROM 2001.

03:35.700 --> 03:37.800
PEOPLE MAGAZINE.

YOU'RE READING A LOT

03:46.967 --> 03:48.067
OF THESE MAGAZINES
YOU DON'T LIKE.

03:48.100 --> 03:49.100
I WAS LOOKING
AT IT OUT THERE,

03:49.133 --> 03:50.300
IT WAS RIGHT
ON THE COVER...

03:50.333 --> 03:52.167
YEAH, YOU GOT A LOT OF
THAT STUFF MEMORIZED.

03:52.200 --> 03:55.300
GIVE ME A GOLF MAGAZINE
OR SOMETHING.

03:55.333 --> 03:56.867
I GOT THE POINT,

03:56.900 --> 03:58.133
GET NATION,
HOW ABOUT NATION ?

03:58.167 --> 03:59.300

03:59.333 --> 04:00.600
YOU READ NATION ?
IT'S A FABULOUS MAGAZINE.

04:00.633 --> 04:03.133
I HAVE READ NATION,
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

04:03.167 --> 04:04.467
HEY, LARRY.

04:21.467 --> 04:23.233
LARRY, HOW YOU
FEELING ?

04:23.267 --> 04:24.200

04:24.233 --> 04:27.367
UNFORTUNATELY, I CAN'T
GIVE YOU A CLEAN

04:27.400 --> 04:28.467
BILL OF HEALTH
AT THIS POINT.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.067
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

04:30.100 --> 04:33.200
THERE WAS A LITTLE,
SLIGHT ABNORMALITY.

04:33.233 --> 04:34.533
WE WERE GOING
ALONG GREAT,

04:34.567 --> 04:36.100
AND YOU KIND OF SPIKED
A LITTLE THERE.

04:36.133 --> 04:39.500
AND I, I CAN'T, I CAN'T
SIGN THE FORM FOR YOU.

04:42.967 --> 04:45.233
BELIEVE ME, THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH ME, I'M FINE.

04:45.267 --> 04:48.833
JACK, I'M FINE,
TRUST ME, I'M FINE.

04:48.867 --> 04:51.633
LARRY, I CAN'T
SIGN THE FORM FOR YOU

04:51.667 --> 04:53.867
WITHOUT TAKING SOME
PRECAUTIONS, OKAY ?

04:53.900 --> 04:55.067
AND HERE'S WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO.

04:55.067 --> 04:56.700
IT'S SIMPLE,
COME ON.

04:56.733 --> 04:58.167
THERE'S NO
IRREGULARITY.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.667
YES, THERE IS, LARRY !

04:59.700 --> 05:02.167
BELIEVE, I WENT
TO MEDICAL SCHOOL, I KNOW.

05:02.200 --> 05:05.133
SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS THIS,
LISTEN, IT'S SIMPLE.

05:05.167 --> 05:07.700
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A DEVICE
CALLED A HEART HALTER, OKAY ?

05:07.733 --> 05:09.600
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

05:09.633 --> 05:11.067
LARRY, I HAVE
TO DO IT.

05:11.067 --> 05:12.267
I HAVE TO DO IT.

05:12.300 --> 05:14.933
IT STRAPS ON,
A COUPLE OF ELECTRODES,

05:14.967 --> 05:17.333
YOU WEAR IT FOR 24 HOURS,
IT MEASURES YOUR HEARTBEAT,

05:17.367 --> 05:21.667
YOU COME BACK AND IF THIS WAS
AN ABNORMALITY, AN ABERRATION,

05:21.700 --> 05:22.867
THE DEVICE
WILL CONFIRM IT.

05:22.900 --> 05:24.800
YOU GET BACK ON THE TREADMILL
FOR FIVE MINUTES,

05:24.833 --> 05:26.667
I SIGN THE SLIP
AND YOU'RE OFF TO BROADWAY.

05:26.700 --> 05:27.833
RENE?

05:27.867 --> 05:29.067
DO YOU HAV
THE HALTER ?

05:29.067 --> 05:30.333
YOU WANT TO, YOU WANT
TO GIVE THAT TO LARRY ?

05:30.367 --> 05:32.267
LARRY, I'M GONNA SCHEDULE YOU
FOR AN APPOINTMENT TOMORROW.

05:32.300 --> 05:34.367

05:34.400 --> 05:35.600
COME ON.
WILL YOU STAND UP ?

05:35.633 --> 05:38.900
WILL YOU TAKE OFF
YOUR JACKET, LARRY ?

05:38.933 --> 05:39.800
GREAT.

05:39.833 --> 05:41.700
IT'S REALLY EASY.

05:41.733 --> 05:43.333
THERE WE GO.

05:43.367 --> 05:45.433
THERE YOU GO.

05:45.467 --> 05:46.933
THAT'S IT.

05:46.967 --> 05:48.600
THERE.

05:52.900 --> 05:55.067
SO, I GOT TO TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.

05:55.100 --> 05:56.433
YOU KNOW, I TOOK
RENEE HOME, YOU KNOW.

05:56.467 --> 05:58.667
AND, UH, WE STOPPED
AND, UH...

05:58.700 --> 06:00.300
YEAH, I JUST SAW HER
AT DR. JACK'S.

06:00.333 --> 06:01.300
HE'S UNBELIEVABLE.

06:01.333 --> 06:02.967
YEAH, SHE'S BEYOND
UNBELIEVABLE.

06:03.067 --> 06:05.067
BUT THE POINT
OF IT IS THAT I,

06:05.067 --> 06:07.933
LOOK, HAVE YOU EVER MADE IT
WITH AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN ?

06:07.967 --> 06:09.467
YES.

06:09.500 --> 06:10.900
TWICE.

06:10.933 --> 06:12.233
WHAT, THE SAME
ONE TWICE ?

06:12.267 --> 06:13.067
TWO DIFFERENT ONES.

06:13.100 --> 06:13.933
SAME TIME ?

06:13.967 --> 06:15.933
NO, SAME TIME,
NEVER SAME TIME.

06:15.967 --> 06:17.533
I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW,
I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW,

06:17.567 --> 06:19.233
FOR SOME REASON
I, I, I NEVER, I,

06:19.267 --> 06:20.500
I NEVER DID IT WITH,
WITH A BLACK...

06:20.533 --> 06:22.700
HMM, SO YOU NEVER MET,
YOU NEVER MET ONE, OR...

06:22.733 --> 06:24.600
NO, NO ONE I REALLY,
YOU KNOW...

06:24.633 --> 06:26.100
OKAY, SO SHE'LL
BE THE FIRST.

06:26.133 --> 06:27.933
THIS WOMAN'S
EXTRAORDINARY.

06:27.967 --> 06:30.167
SO, HERE'S THE THING,

06:30.200 --> 06:32.067
A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO
I WENT TO A KNICK GAME.

06:32.067 --> 06:33.367
AND I WENT
INTO THE LOCKER ROOM

06:33.400 --> 06:35.633
TO SAY HELLO TO SOME OF
MY FRIENDS, YOU KNOW.

06:35.667 --> 06:37.367
AND THEY WERE SHOWERING
AND I LOOKED,

06:37.400 --> 06:38.767
I SAW ONE OF
THE FORWARDS.

06:38.800 --> 06:41.367
AND HE JUST THREW THE TOWEL OFF,
HE WAS GETTING DRESSED,

06:41.400 --> 06:42.067
AND I LOOKED DOWN,
I SAW...

06:42.100 --> 06:44.067
BIG ?BIG, YEA.

06:44.067 --> 06:45.800
BIG ?UH, ?

06:45.833 --> 06:48.067
THEY COULD PUT THE CHICAGO
FIRE OUT WITH THIS.

06:48.067 --> 06:49.433
IT WAS...
IT WAS A JOKE.

06:49.467 --> 06:50.300
WELL...

06:50.333 --> 06:52.067
IT WAS LIKE
FROM ANOTHER PLANET.

06:52.067 --> 06:53.567
WELL, HE'S A BIG GUY,
HE'S A FORWARD.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.633
YOU NEED TO SEE A GUARD,
DID YOU SEE A GUARD ?

06:55.667 --> 06:57.433
YOU CAN'T TELL BY A FORWARD,
THEY'RE TOO BIG,

06:57.467 --> 06:58.400
HE'S OUT OF
PROPORTION.

06:58.433 --> 07:00.767
I DON'T CARE,
IT'S ME AND RENEE.

07:00.800 --> 07:03.900
AND I, AND MAYBE BECAUSE,
MAYBE BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

07:03.933 --> 07:05.067
SHE'S BLACK,
SHE MAYBE DATES,
YOU KNOW...

07:05.100 --> 07:07.267
SO YOU THINK THE BLACK WOMAN
MIGHT BE USED TO A...

07:07.300 --> 07:09.433
WELL, I MEAN, IF THEY'RE USED,
I MEAN, IF THAT...

07:09.467 --> 07:10.800
NOT A MYTH OR,
I MEAN, IF IT IS...

07:10.833 --> 07:12.967
I COULD SEE HOW, LIKE,
YEAH, IT COULD BE A CONCERN.

07:13.067 --> 07:15.700
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I WOULD
EVER WANT TO HAVE INTERCOURSE

07:15.733 --> 07:18.233
WITH HER, BECAUSE
I'M A LITTLE INTIMIDATED.

07:18.267 --> 07:20.300
AND YOU'RE ONE OF THE FEW
FRIENDS I CAN TELL THIS TO.

07:20.333 --> 07:24.533
OKAY, WELL, THEN MAYBE
I CAN, I CAN STEP IN.

07:24.567 --> 07:26.800
I GOT THAT 10th
ANNIVERSARY PRESENT.

07:26.833 --> 07:29.067
I'M SAYING IF YOU
WANT TO, YOU KNOW,

07:29.067 --> 07:33.233
IF YOU'RE TOO INTIMIDATED TO GO
THROUGH WITH IT, I COULD TRY.

07:33.267 --> 07:34.367
A GOOD FRIEND
DOESN'T DO THAT.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.833
YOU DON'T, YOU DON'T--
YOU DON'T HAVE INTERCOURSE

07:36.867 --> 07:39.067
WITH SOMEONE WHO
YOUR FRIEND DOESN'T SCREW.

07:39.067 --> 07:41.533
WHY, IT WOULD BE A NICE 10th
ANNIVERSARY PRESENT FOR ME ?

07:41.567 --> 07:43.900
I'D RATHER GO TO TIFFANY'S
AND GET YOU A BOWL.

07:43.933 --> 07:46.300
I DON'T
WANT A BOWL.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.233
ALRIGHT.

07:49.867 --> 07:52.067
HERE YOU GO.

07:52.067 --> 07:54.533
YEAH, I'M NOT
THE VALET.

07:54.567 --> 07:57.400
OH, I'M, I'M--
YEAH.

07:57.433 --> 07:59.267
IT IS POSSIBLE FOR BLACK PEOPLE
TO HAVE OTHER JOBS.

07:59.300 --> 08:00.900
NO, UH, NO,
I KNOW, OF COURSE.

08:00.933 --> 08:02.367
YEAH, YEAH, I ALREADY
KNOW, MAN, OKAY.

08:02.400 --> 08:03.300
NO, BECAUSE...

08:03.333 --> 08:05.267
IT'S BECAUSE
I'M BLACK.

08:05.300 --> 08:07.400
I'M SORRY.
YEAH.

08:07.433 --> 08:09.067
YOU FUCKED UP.

08:09.067 --> 08:10.433
SORRY.

08:12.467 --> 08:13.433
SORRY.

08:21.600 --> 08:25.733
SO, YOU AUTOMATICALLY THINK THE
BLACK MAN IS THE VALET, HUH ?

08:25.767 --> 08:26.767
NO, I DON'T
AUTOMATICALLY--

08:26.800 --> 08:28.067
YES, YOU DID,
I SAW IT.

08:28.100 --> 08:30.200
NO, HE'S STANDING
BY THE VALET...

08:30.233 --> 08:31.467
"GET MY CAR, BOY."

08:31.500 --> 08:33.700
I SAW IT, LARRY.

08:33.733 --> 08:35.400
HE HAD ON A WHITE SHIRT,
AND A RED TIE AND A VEST.

08:35.433 --> 08:37.367
HE'S STANDING BY THE VALET SIGN,
IT'S AN HONEST MISTAKE, C'MON.

08:37.400 --> 08:42.233
OH YEAH, YEAH, ANYTIME I SEE
A BLACK MAN IN A TIE AND A SUIT,

08:42.267 --> 08:44.467
I THINK "HEY, YOU MUST
PARK CARS FOR A LIVING."

08:44.500 --> 08:45.800
I FEEL IT WAS AN
HONEST MISTAKE, WANDA.

08:45.833 --> 08:48.967
NO, NO, IF IT WAS A WHITE MAN
STANDING HERE, YOU WOULD NOT.

08:49.067 --> 08:51.367
WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM
THE VALET, I, I WOULD TOO.

08:51.400 --> 08:52.233
I WOULD, TOO HAVE.
NO, YOU WOULDN'T.

08:52.267 --> 08:53.100
TOO, TOO.
NO, YOU WOULDN'T.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.233
NO, YOU WOULD
HAVE ASKED HIM...

08:55.267 --> 08:56.300
TOO, TOO...
NOT.

08:56.333 --> 09:00.067
YOU WOULD HAVE ASKED HIM
FOR A STOCK TIP, OR,

09:00.067 --> 09:01.167
OH, YEAH, RIGHT.
SO, WHERE YOU GOLF ?

09:01.200 --> 09:03.367
HOW'S THE
FILMING GOING ?

09:03.400 --> 09:04.800
IT'S GOOD.

09:04.833 --> 09:05.933
I'M SHOOTING
OVER THERE.

09:05.967 --> 09:07.267
ON MY LITTLE BREAK.

09:07.300 --> 09:09.467
LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

09:09.500 --> 09:12.767
YOU'VE SLEPT WITH
A LOT OF WHITE MEN
AND BLACK MEN, I'M SURE.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.433
IS THERE ANY
DISCERNIBLE DIFFERENCE ?

09:14.467 --> 09:15.533
WHAT ?

09:15.567 --> 09:17.100
LET ME REPHRASE THAT.

09:17.133 --> 09:17.900
LET ME
REPHRASE THAT.

09:17.933 --> 09:19.067
YEAH, REPHRASE THAT.

09:19.067 --> 09:22.500
UM, IS THERE ANY
DISCERNIBLE DIFFERENCE

09:22.533 --> 09:26.767
BETWEEN A WHITE MAN
AND A BLACK MAN...

09:26.800 --> 09:29.133
YOU KNOW...

09:32.700 --> 09:35.267
WHY WOULD YOU ASK ME
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, LARRY ?

09:35.300 --> 09:36.933
MY FRIEND
WANTS TO KNOW.

09:36.967 --> 09:37.967
WHY, WHAT'S
THE BIG DEAL ?

09:38.067 --> 09:39.600
I AM NOT GONNA
ANSWER THAT.

09:39.633 --> 09:42.300
( spitting )

09:42.333 --> 09:43.333
THAT, WHAT IS THAT ?

09:43.367 --> 09:44.500
WHAT THE FUCK,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

09:44.533 --> 09:45.967
IT'S A BUG, A BUG.

09:46.067 --> 09:47.067
I HAD A BUG ON ME.

09:47.067 --> 09:48.600
WELL LOOK, DID YOU GET
MY SCRIPT TO THAT GUY,

09:48.633 --> 09:50.133
THAT MARTIN SCHAFFER ?

09:50.167 --> 09:52.467
OH, OH YEAH, EVERYTHING'S OKAY,
SINCE I OWE YOU A LITTLE FAVOR.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.233
YES, HE DID.
DID HE GET MY SCRIPT ?

09:54.267 --> 09:55.567
AND WHAT ?
AND ?

09:55.600 --> 09:58.067
I GAVE IT TO HIM, AND HE'LL
READ IT AND GET BACK TO YOU.

09:58.100 --> 09:59.767
HE'S NOT GONNA
REWRITE IT, IS HE ?

09:59.800 --> 10:00.833
NO.

10:00.867 --> 10:03.033
OKAY, 'CAUSE
THAT'S MY BABY.

10:03.067 --> 10:04.267
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

10:04.300 --> 10:05.633
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY
MESSING WITH MY BABY.

10:05.667 --> 10:06.867
YEAH, NO ONE'S GOING
TO MESS WITH YOUR BABY,

10:06.900 --> 10:07.867
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

10:07.900 --> 10:09.367
I'M GOING
BACK TO WORK.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.333
YEAH, GO BACK
TO WORK, YEAH.

10:10.367 --> 10:12.467
MESSING WITH YOU.
YEAH.

10:12.500 --> 10:15.367
IS THERE ANY BLACK MEN AROUND
HERE TO, IS THERE A VALET ?

10:15.400 --> 10:18.633
I NEED A BLACK MAN
TO GET MY CAR.

10:18.667 --> 10:20.167
IS THERE A BLACK MAN
IN THE AREA

10:20.200 --> 10:22.033
WHO WANTS TO TAKE
MY VALET TICKET ?

10:31.133 --> 10:32.600
EXCUSE ME ?

10:32.633 --> 10:33.467
YEAH, HI.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.833
SURE.
YOU WORK HERE ?

10:34.867 --> 10:36.533
IS THIS
THE ONLY DOLL ?

10:36.567 --> 10:37.900
YEAH, THAT'S
THE ONLY ONE LEFT.

10:37.933 --> 10:40.267
THAT'S IT ?
YEAH, LAST ONE.

10:42.267 --> 10:43.567
HUH.
ISN'T THAT CUTE ?

10:46.267 --> 10:48.000
WHAT'S THE RACE
ON THIS DOLL ?

10:48.033 --> 10:49.233
UH, IT'S BI-RACIAL.

10:49.267 --> 10:50.500
BI-RACIAL ?
YEAH.

10:50.533 --> 10:53.433
REALLY ?
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

10:53.467 --> 10:54.833
HUH.

10:54.867 --> 11:00.233
SO, THEY MAKE THIS DOLL
SPECIFICALLY FOR MIXED COUPLES ?

11:00.267 --> 11:01.200
FOR BLACK
AND WHITE COUPLES ?

11:01.233 --> 11:03.133
THEY MAKE A DOLL
FOR THEIR KIDS ?

11:03.167 --> 11:04.433
I DON'T KNOW.

11:04.467 --> 11:06.800
IF SOMEBODY'S ASIAN,
AND THEY MARRY A WHITE PERSON,

11:06.833 --> 11:10.633
ARE THEY MAKING SORT OF A HALF
ASIAN, HALF WHITE DOLL, TOO ?

11:10.667 --> 11:12.333
SEE WHAT
I'M GETTING AT ?

11:12.367 --> 11:13.867
YEAH.

11:13.900 --> 11:16.400
I THINK THAT'S, YEAH.

11:16.433 --> 11:20.067
HMM, I WONDER
IF YOU DO.

11:20.067 --> 11:21.233
OKAY.

11:21.267 --> 11:24.600
UM, WELL I GUESS
I'LL TAKE IT.

11:24.633 --> 11:26.167
EXCELLENT, LET ME
WRAP IT UP FOR YOU.

11:26.200 --> 11:27.500
OKAY.

11:30.400 --> 11:33.067
OH, SURPRISE,
IT SAYS MEOW.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.533
ISN'T THAT
ADORABLE ?

11:35.567 --> 11:37.833
OH, I LOVE IT,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

11:37.867 --> 11:39.367
THAT'S SO SWEET.

11:45.733 --> 11:48.767
( whispering )
Thank you,
you made it.

11:48.800 --> 11:51.667
WHAT, WHAT IS THIS ?

11:51.700 --> 11:53.533
OH, THAT'S FOR MY HEART,
IT'S TO MONITOR MY HEART.

11:53.567 --> 11:54.667
WHAT ?

11:54.700 --> 11:55.700
NO, NO, I'M FINE, THERE
WAS AN ABERRATION IN...

11:55.733 --> 11:56.533
MY GOD, THAT'S HEAVY...

11:56.567 --> 11:58.767
NO, I'VE GOT
WIRES UNDER THERE.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.833
ARE YOU OKAY ?
NO, I'M FINE.

12:00.867 --> 12:01.933
WHAT DOES
THAT MEAN ?

12:01.967 --> 12:03.100
NOTHING, IT'S JUST,
THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG

12:03.133 --> 12:04.900
WITH THE MACHINE,
THE DOCTOR WOULDN'T SIGN OFF.

12:04.933 --> 12:05.967
IT'S NOTHING,
IT'S JUST...

12:06.067 --> 12:07.167
HOW LONG DO YOU
HAVE TO WEAR THIS ?

12:07.200 --> 12:08.400
JUST A DAY.

12:08.433 --> 12:10.667
DOESN'T BERNIE DOOSENBURY
LOOK LIKE STEVE DEMARCO ?

12:10.700 --> 12:11.800
NO.

12:11.833 --> 12:12.867
ARE YOU KIDDING,
HE LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE HIM.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.100
YES.
STEVE DEMARCO ?

12:15.133 --> 12:16.633
THEY DON'T LOOK
ANYTHING ALIKE.

12:16.667 --> 12:18.067
ANY TIME I EVER
POINT OUT THAT

12:18.100 --> 12:20.533
SOMEBODY LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE
ELSE, YOU ALWAYS DISAGREE.

12:20.567 --> 12:22.067
BECAUSE THEY
NEVER DO.

12:22.067 --> 12:24.767
THEY ALWAYS DO.
THEY NEVER DO.

12:24.800 --> 12:25.267
IS THAT, HEY, OH,
SHE'S OPENING OUR GIFT.

12:25.300 --> 12:26.067
OH, GOOD.

12:26.067 --> 12:28.067
THIS IS
FROM THE DAVIDS.

12:28.100 --> 12:30.967
OH, A DOLL.

12:31.067 --> 12:32.067
IT'S A MULATTO.

12:36.567 --> 12:38.567
NO GOOD ?

12:38.600 --> 12:40.700
BI-RACIAL IS WHAT
WE CALL IT, USUALLY.

12:40.733 --> 12:42.333
BI-RACIAL.

12:42.367 --> 12:44.500
HMM, WHAT DO YOU
KNOW ABOUT THAT ?

12:44.533 --> 12:46.533
OH LOOK, THEY GAVE US
ANOTHER ONE, TOO.

12:46.567 --> 12:50.133
THAT'S ACTUALLY, UM,
FOR THE SURROGATE.

12:50.167 --> 12:50.833
OH.

12:57.133 --> 12:58.567
WELL, THAT'S IT, GANG.

12:58.600 --> 13:03.400
UM, WHY DON'T WE HAVE
SOME COFFEE OR SOME DESERT,

13:03.433 --> 13:04.567
'CAUSE THAT'S IT.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.200
THAT'S ALL
THE GIFTS.

13:06.233 --> 13:07.200
( male )
THANK YOU GUYS FOR COMING,
THANKS FOR THE GIFTS.

13:07.233 --> 13:08.633
WHAT ?

13:13.067 --> 13:14.700
HE.

13:14.733 --> 13:16.067
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

13:16.067 --> 13:17.167
YOU'RE WELCOME.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.367
I DIDN'T EXPECT IT.

13:18.400 --> 13:19.767
YOU'RE THE ONE CARRYING
THE BABY, THAT'S YOUR BABY.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.133
I WOULDN'T EXPECT THEM TO,
BUT THANK YOU.

13:22.167 --> 13:24.133
IT'S VERY
UNNECESSARY.

13:24.167 --> 13:24.667
YEAH.

13:24.700 --> 13:25.867
WHAT DO YOU DO ?

13:25.900 --> 13:26.767
I'M A WRITER.

13:26.800 --> 13:29.067
OH, THAT'S COOL.

13:29.100 --> 13:30.067
SOUNDS GOOD.

13:30.100 --> 13:31.933
YEAH.YE.

13:31.967 --> 13:34.200
SOMETIMES THOUGH,
IT'S NOT SUCH A GREAT JOB.

13:34.233 --> 13:36.667
YOU KNOW, LIKE FOR EXAMPLE
I GOT THIS FRIEND.

13:36.700 --> 13:40.867
SHE JUST GAVE A SCRIPT
TO ME TO GIVE TO SOMEBODY.

13:40.900 --> 13:42.967
SHE SAID, "DON'T LET HIM
TOUCH MY BABY", YOU KNOW.

13:43.067 --> 13:44.733
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO.

13:44.767 --> 13:47.400
YOU WORK ON SOMETHING
FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS,

13:47.433 --> 13:52.067
THEN THEY TAKE IT AWAY FROM YOU,
AND THEN THAT'S IT.

13:52.067 --> 13:52.867
YOU NEVER SEE
IT AGAIN.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.333
THEY TAKE
YOUR BABY FROM YOU,

13:54.367 --> 13:58.267
THEY GIVE YOUR BABY
TO SOMEBODY ELSE,
AND THAT'S IT.

13:58.300 --> 14:01.533
YOU'VE LOST COMPLETE
CONTACT WITH YOUR BABY.

14:01.567 --> 14:03.767
YOU NEVER SEE THE BABY AGAIN,
AND IT'S YOUR BABY.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.600
AND THEY GIVE IT
TO ANOTHER WRITER.

14:05.633 --> 14:07.933
AND THAT WRITER DOESN'T LET YOU
EVEN LOOK AT YOUR BABY.

14:07.967 --> 14:10.367
BUT THAT'S PART OF YOUR JOB,
THAT'S WHAT YOU SIGNED UP FOR.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.067
I MEAN, YOU KNEW
YOU HAD TO GIVE IT AWAY.

14:12.067 --> 14:14.933
SORT OF, BUT IT'S HARD
TO GIVE UP THAT BABY.

14:14.967 --> 14:16.233
MAYBE IN A FEW YEARS

14:16.267 --> 14:18.167
YOU CAN SEE HOW YOUR SCRIPT'S
DOING OR SOMETHING.

14:18.200 --> 14:20.267
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT THEN
IT'S ALL CHANGED.

14:20.300 --> 14:23.567
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.200
ALRIGHT.

14:25.233 --> 14:26.133
YOU WANT TO GET
SOME COFFEE ?

14:32.967 --> 14:34.300
NO WAY OUT.

14:34.333 --> 14:37.267
IT WAS SHOCKING,
OUTRAGEOUS, INSULTING

14:37.300 --> 14:39.100
AND I LOVED
EVERY MINUTE OF IT.

14:39.133 --> 14:40.467
NO WAY OUT.

14:40.500 --> 14:41.400
HEY !

14:41.433 --> 14:43.300
HOW ARE YOU ?
HOW ARE YOU ?

14:43.333 --> 14:44.200
HEY.

14:44.233 --> 14:46.333
I AM THOROUGHLY
IMPRESSED.

14:46.367 --> 14:47.267
WELL, OH, COME ON.

14:47.300 --> 14:50.133
YES, SURPRISINGLY GOOD.

14:50.167 --> 14:51.533
STILL ON THE BOOK,
UH, HAVE YOU,

14:51.567 --> 14:53.133
YOU DON'T HAVE IT
UNDER YOUR BELT YET ?

14:53.167 --> 14:55.367
FUNNY YOU SHOULD
MENTION THAT.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.333
WHY IS, IS, I MEAN...

14:57.367 --> 14:59.567
WE OPEN, DUDE, WE OPEN
IN THREE AND A HALF WEEKS.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.167
YEAH, I KNOW.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.933
I MEAN, EVERY TIME YOU WORK, HE
ALWAYS HAS THE SCRIPT, ALWAYS ?

15:02.967 --> 15:04.300
YES, EVERY TIME.

15:04.333 --> 15:05.133
YOU KNOW...
ALWAYS ?

15:05.167 --> 15:06.333
I'LL BE FINE.

15:06.367 --> 15:07.667
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A LITTLE
PROBLEM MEMORIZING STUFF.

15:07.700 --> 15:08.833
I'LL BE ALRIGHT.

15:08.867 --> 15:10.367
DID YOU GUYS GET
YOUR TEST RESULTS BACK,

15:10.400 --> 15:12.267
THE INSURANCE COMPANY'S
BEEN BUGGING ME.

15:12.300 --> 15:13.367
YES, YES, YEAH,
YEAH, I GOT MINE ?

15:13.400 --> 15:14.633
HERE, HERE, HERE.

15:14.667 --> 15:17.567
CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH,
FLYING COLORS I MIGHT ADD.

15:17.600 --> 15:19.433
OH, RESULTS,
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

15:19.467 --> 15:21.633
AND YOUR, WHERE'S YOUR
LITTLE, UH, PAPER ?

15:21.667 --> 15:25.233
UH, I HAD A LITTLE
BIT OF, UM... PROBLEM.

15:25.267 --> 15:26.300
WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT ?

15:26.333 --> 15:28.167
WHAT IS THAT ?

15:28.200 --> 15:29.167
YEAH, I DIDN'T...

15:29.200 --> 15:30.667
WHAT IS THAT ?

15:30.700 --> 15:32.967
IT'S, UH, CALLED
A HEART HALTER.

15:33.067 --> 15:33.767
HEART HALTER ?

15:33.800 --> 15:35.367
I'M FINE, I'M FINE.

15:35.400 --> 15:37.367
UH, I JUST DIDN'T PASS
THE PHYSICAL, THAT'S ALL, BUT...

15:37.400 --> 15:38.300
WHAT ?
I DIDN'T PASS THE...

15:38.333 --> 15:39.133
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

15:39.167 --> 15:40.200
THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH ME.

15:40.233 --> 15:41.767
I MEAN, ARE YOU
TOO OLD FOR THIS ?

15:41.800 --> 15:42.900
IS THAT WHAT HE SAID ?

15:42.933 --> 15:44.833
NO, NO, NO, I'M NOT
TOO OLD FOR IT, BELIEVE ME.

15:44.867 --> 15:45.833
IT WAS A FLUKE.

15:45.867 --> 15:47.833
I'M FINE, THERE'S
NOTHING WRONG WITH ME.

15:47.867 --> 15:49.167
SERIOUSLY, SERIOUSLY
AFTER THREE, LIKE,

15:49.200 --> 15:50.167
SHUFFLE BALL CHAINS
HE'S WINDED.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.400
HEY, YOU WANT

15:51.433 --> 15:52.733
YOU WANT TO GO OUT, YOU WANT
TO GO TO THE PARKING LOT ?

15:52.767 --> 15:54.600
I'LL GO RIGHT NOW.
REALLY ?

15:54.633 --> 15:55.233
HEY, FELLAS...

15:55.267 --> 15:56.633
PUT YOUR SNEAKERS ON.

15:56.667 --> 15:58.133
I DON'T NEED, I DON'T
EVEN SNEAKERS, I'LL GO...

15:58.167 --> 16:00.067
LET'S STOP, LET'S STOP
BEING JUVENILE, YOU CAN'T...

16:00.067 --> 16:01.333
I'M NOT BEING...

16:01.367 --> 16:03.433
LET'S NOT RACE HIM,
NOW LOOK, FOLKS...

16:03.467 --> 16:04.533
UH, EXCUSE ME,
I'M SORRY.

16:04.567 --> 16:05.667
HEY, DAD, HEY.

16:05.700 --> 16:06.933
YOU DON'T THINK
I COULD BEAT HIM IN A RACE ?

16:06.967 --> 16:08.600
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN
BEAT HIM IN A RACE.

16:08.633 --> 16:10.067
OH, CAN I TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENED ?

16:10.100 --> 16:12.233
I'M ON THE TREADMILL TAKING
THE STRESS TEST, OKAY...

16:12.267 --> 16:12.967
I GOT THE PICTURES
FROM SPAIN.

16:13.067 --> 16:14.333
OH, FROM SPAIN.

16:14.367 --> 16:15.500
YEAH, I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT LIKE THAT.

16:15.533 --> 16:17.400
OH, THAT'S EXCELLENT,
WHOA...

16:17.433 --> 16:20.500
IF SHE COMES IN THAT ROOM AGAIN,
TOMORROW WHEN I TAKE THE TEST,

16:20.533 --> 16:22.267
I'LL BE LOOKING AT THE CEILING,
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

16:22.300 --> 16:23.467

17:18.767 --> 17:19.900
MY PARENTS

ALRIGHT, DAD.

17:34.067 --> 17:36.667
YOU TOLD HIM ABOUT THE WHOLE
CASHEW RAISIN THING, RIGHT ?

17:36.700 --> 17:39.067
YOU KNOW, WE'RE TALKING,
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO GO BACK

17:39.067 --> 17:40.167
AND TELL HIM, LARRY...

17:40.200 --> 17:41.300
WHAT, ARE YOU
KIDDING ?

17:41.333 --> 17:43.067
I KNOW YOU SAID SOMETHING,
HE WAS SO UNFRIENDLY.

17:43.100 --> 17:44.400
WELL, OF COURSE
I SAID SOMETHING.

17:44.433 --> 17:46.667
IT WAS YOUR SUGGESTION,
MR. CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM.

17:46.700 --> 17:48.600
HEY, HE'S PUTTING
FOUR CASHEWS IN A BAG.

17:48.633 --> 17:49.733
HE DESERVES SOME
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM.

17:49.767 --> 17:51.333
GO ON ABOUT IT.

17:51.367 --> 17:53.267
I WANT TO CALL HIM,
SERIOUSLY.

17:53.300 --> 17:54.567
I DON'T THINK SO.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.067
I'D JUST LIKE TO CALL HIM
AND APOLOGIZE.

17:56.100 --> 17:58.200
I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE
WITH YOU CALLING MY DAD.

17:58.233 --> 18:00.067

18:00.067 --> 18:02.500

18:45.967 --> 18:46.700

18:46.733 --> 18:48.100

18:49.500 --> 18:50.967

WHAT IS THIS ?

18:55.867 --> 18:57.500
IS IT YOUR HEART ?

18:57.533 --> 18:58.767
ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT,
JUST CALM DOWN.

18:58.800 --> 18:59.900
DON'T TAKE THEM OFF.

19:00.067 --> 19:01.833
LEAVE THEM ON, YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE TOOK THEM OFF.

19:01.867 --> 19:03.767
ALRIGHT, UH,
OH, CHRIST.

19:03.800 --> 19:06.100
I DON'T KNOW C.P.R.

19:06.133 --> 19:07.467
HEY, HEY, SOMEBODY

19:07.500 --> 19:10.067
CALL AN AMBULANCE,

19:10.100 --> 19:11.400
SEND 'EM TO THE PARK,

19:11.433 --> 19:12.567
OH !

19:12.600 --> 19:14.100
HANG, HANG IN THERE,
CAN YOU BREATHE ?

19:14.133 --> 19:16.067
CAN YOU, KEEP, KEEP,
KEEP BREATHING, ALRIGHT.

19:16.100 --> 19:18.067
WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T STOP BREATHING.

19:18.067 --> 19:19.700
JUST KEEP DOING THAT.

19:19.733 --> 19:21.733
YOU GOT A PHONE ?

19:21.767 --> 19:23.633
SERIOUSLY,
THE GUY WAS...

19:23.667 --> 19:26.367
THE GUY WAS COMING AFTER ME
WITH A TIRE IRON.

19:26.400 --> 19:27.667
I FAKED
THE WHOLE THING.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.567
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING ?

19:29.600 --> 19:30.533
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

19:30.567 --> 19:31.467
THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH ME.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.367
THIS IS JUST
SO UNNECESSARY.

19:33.400 --> 19:35.333
SERIOUSLY.

19:35.367 --> 19:38.533
( sirens )

19:58.500 --> 20:00.000
I'VE DATED
BOTH BLACK MEN,

20:00.033 --> 20:02.733
WHITE MEN AND THERE REALLY
ISN'T A DIFFERENCE.

20:02.767 --> 20:04.967
IT'S, IT'S REALLY
JUST KIND OF A MYTH.

20:05.000 --> 20:05.933
THAT'S A MYTH ?

20:05.967 --> 20:07.667
BOY, TOO BAD
FOR THE BLACK GUYS.

20:07.700 --> 20:08.700
I KNOW, I KNOW.

20:08.733 --> 20:10.000
YOU KNOW, I SPEAK
FROM BOTH SIDES,

20:10.033 --> 20:11.700
'CAUSE I'M HALF BLACK
AND HALF WHITE, I...

20:11.733 --> 20:13.000
YEAH.
GET OUT OF TOWN.

20:13.033 --> 20:15.033
I JUST BOUGHT
A MULATTO DOLL TODAY.

20:15.067 --> 20:19.533
OKAY, UM, WE DON'T REALLY
USE MULATTO ANYMORE AS A...

20:19.567 --> 20:22.767
I WAS WONDERING ABOUT THAT,
IF THAT WAS A BAD ONE.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.400
YEAH, IT'S
A BIT OUTDATED.

20:24.433 --> 20:25.500
OKAY.

20:25.533 --> 20:26.933
BUT IF WE ALL KEEP
FUCKING EACH OTHER,

20:26.967 --> 20:28.533
THEN WE'RE GONNA BE THE SAME
RACE SOONER OR LATER, ANYWAYS.

20:28.567 --> 20:29.667
I DO.
LET'S PRAY FOR THAT.

20:29.700 --> 20:31.333
HELLO.
ARE YOU OKAY ?

20:31.367 --> 20:32.933
HI.
HEY, THIS IS MASASA.

20:32.967 --> 20:35.133
HI, I'M CHERYL,
NICE TO MEET YOU.

20:35.167 --> 20:37.933
DO YOU THINK,
DO YOU THINK THAT, UH,

20:37.967 --> 20:40.800
A BI-RACIAL PERSON
WOULD NEED SUN BLOCK ?

20:40.833 --> 20:41.967
I DON'T, UH...
WOULD YOU THINK THAT ?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.333
I HAVE NOT
THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.367
I GUESS YOU HAD TO BE THERE,
WE WERE HAVING A CONVERSATION.

20:45.400 --> 20:46.433
ARE YOU ALRIGHT ?

20:46.467 --> 20:48.700
OKAY, MRS. DAVID,
IT WAS LOVELY MEETING YOU.

20:48.733 --> 20:50.833
AND GOOD LUCK TO YOU
AND, AND YOUR...

20:50.867 --> 20:51.733
THANK YOU.

20:51.767 --> 20:53.633
OH MY GOD,
WHAT HAPPENED ?

20:53.667 --> 20:56.200
OH, I'M...
I'M PERFECTLY FINE.

20:56.233 --> 20:57.000
ARE YOU ?

20:57.033 --> 20:58.567
ABSOLUTELY,
PERFECTLY FINE.

20:58.600 --> 21:01.867
IT WAS A ROAD RAGE INCIDENT,
AND A GUY CAME OUT OF HIS CAR

21:01.900 --> 21:03.800
WITH A TIRE IRON,
HE WAS GONNA KILL ME.

21:03.833 --> 21:05.667
SO, YOU KNOW,
I HAD THE HEART HALTER

21:05.700 --> 21:07.333
AND I FAKED LIKE I WAS
HAVING A HEART ATTACK.

21:07.367 --> 21:08.167
I PULLED
THE WIRES OUT AND...

21:08.200 --> 21:09.700
YOU DID WHAT ?

21:09.733 --> 21:11.567
I FAKED LIKE I WAS
HAVING A HEART ATTACK

21:11.600 --> 21:14.533
SO HE WOULDN'T KILL ME.

21:14.567 --> 21:16.367
SO THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH YOU ?

21:16.400 --> 21:18.533
NO, I'M FINE.

21:18.567 --> 21:22.167
THEN WHY AM I HERE ?

21:22.200 --> 21:25.400
WHY ARE YOU
IN A HOSPITAL BED
RIGHT NOW ?

21:25.433 --> 21:27.200
WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ?

21:27.233 --> 21:30.133
THEY TOOK ME TO THE HOSPITAL
BECAUSE OF THE HEART ATTACK.

21:30.167 --> 21:32.133
SO YOU'RE TAKING UP
A HOSPITAL BED

21:32.167 --> 21:35.733
BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID OF
SOME WEIRD GUY IN TRAFFIC ?

21:35.767 --> 21:37.133
HE HAD A TIRE IRON,
HE WAS GONNA KILL ME.

21:37.167 --> 21:39.233
YOU'RE IN THE HOSPITAL,
IF YOU'RE CALLING ME

21:39.267 --> 21:40.633
TO RUSH OVER TO HELP YOU
I WOULD THINK THAT

21:40.667 --> 21:42.067
THERE WAS SOMETHING
WRONG WITH YOU.

21:42.067 --> 21:44.733
OH, SO YOU'D RATHER COME IN HERE
AND SEE ME WITH BROKEN LIMBS ?

21:44.767 --> 21:46.100
WELL, I'D RATHER
NOT COME IN HERE

21:46.133 --> 21:48.533
AND SEE YOU CHATTING
IT UP WITH THE NURSE.

21:48.567 --> 21:49.800
I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO TALK TO A NURSE ?

21:49.833 --> 21:51.767
WELL, YOU'RE HAVING
A GOOD TIME IN THE HOSPITAL.

21:51.800 --> 21:53.900
I DON'T UNDERSTAND, YOU JUST
WANTED SOMEONE TO KILL ME ?

21:53.933 --> 21:56.533
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANTED,
YOU WOULD PREFER THAT ?

21:56.567 --> 21:59.733
BY THE WAY, WHAT DID
YOU SAY TO THE SURROGATE ?

21:59.767 --> 22:02.567
SHE'S GONE INTO LABOR,
SHE'S HERE AT THE HOSPITAL,

22:02.600 --> 22:05.667
AND SHE'S NOT GONNA
GIVE THE BABY UP.

22:05.700 --> 22:07.400
WHAT DID YOU
TELL HER ?

22:07.433 --> 22:08.900
SHE SAID SHE HAD
A TALK WITH YOU.

22:08.933 --> 22:10.100
I DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING.

22:10.133 --> 22:11.300
WELL, YOU MUST HAVE
SAID SOMETHING

22:11.333 --> 22:13.500
BECAUSE BERNIE DOOSENBURY
IS LOOKING FOR YOU

22:13.533 --> 22:16.067
'CAUSE HE WANTS
TO KICK YOUR ASS.

22:16.100 --> 22:18.067
THAT'S A QUOTE ?
THAT'S A QUOTE.

22:19.500 --> 22:21.233
THOSE BASTARDS.

22:21.267 --> 22:22.433
THE FOURTH TIME
I'VE BEEN HERE,

22:22.467 --> 22:24.367
AND I STILL CAN'T GET
THIS COLOSTOMY BAG TO FIT.

22:24.400 --> 22:26.067
IT DOESN'T FIT.

22:26.067 --> 22:28.233
AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY
WON'T PAY FOR IT.

22:28.267 --> 22:30.233
IT'S FULL
ALL THE TIME.

22:30.267 --> 22:33.100
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY
JUST DON'T TAKE CARE OF IT.

22:34.933 --> 22:36.300
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

22:36.333 --> 22:37.600
YOU CAN'T
KEEP THAT BABY.

22:37.633 --> 22:39.667
I WAS TALKING
ABOUT A SCRIPT.

22:39.700 --> 22:42.600
I WANT THAT
PANDA BACK !

22:42.633 --> 22:45.967
SO, YOU KNOW, I SPOKE
TO THIS, UH, THIS NURSE.

22:46.067 --> 22:47.633
SHE'S BI-RACIAL.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.067
BI, WHAT DO YOU
MEAN BI-RACIAL ?

22:49.067 --> 22:49.967
SHE'S HALF BLACK,
HALF WHITE, MULATTO.

22:50.067 --> 22:51.667
BISEXUAL...

22:51.700 --> 22:52.733
MULATTO, THEY SAY, THEY DON'T
SAY MULATTO ANYMORE.

22:52.767 --> 22:54.233
SHE GOT MAD AT ME.

22:54.267 --> 22:57.100
BUT ANYWAY, SHE SAID SHE'S BEEN
WITH BLACK MEN AND WHITE MEN,

22:57.133 --> 22:58.367
AND SHE SAID THERE'S
NO DIFFERENCE, SO.

22:58.400 --> 23:01.067
YEAH.

23:01.067 --> 23:02.300

LIKE, "LET ME LOCK MY CAR."

25:15.567 --> 25:16.667

25:52.600 --> 25:54.433
OH, I DON'T KNOW,

25:54.467 --> 25:58.367
IT MAKES A BIG, LARRY, YOU DON'T

26:03.067 --> 26:05.433
HELPING THE
BLACK PERSON."

26:05.467 --> 26:06.867
YOU SHOULD
KNOW BETTER.

26:06.900 --> 26:09.067
THAT'S WHEN YOU TELL
SOMEBODY THEY'RE BLACK.

26:09.067 --> 26:11.067
ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT, I'LL TELL HIM

UNBELIEVABLE.

26:56.767 --> 26:57.800
I GOT TO TELL

IT'S ONE OF
THE FEW TIMES

26:58.933 --> 27:01.133
IN MY LIFE ANYONE'S
EVER TAKEN MY ADVICE.

27:01.167 --> 27:02.233
IT'S A PLEASURE.

27:02.267 --> 27:05.233
WELL, THE DOCTOR'S
WAITING TO SEE YOU.

27:05.267 --> 27:06.067

27:48.533 --> 27:53.633

27:53.667 --> 27:59.267
And the dispenser was destroyed
virtually beyond recognition.

27:59.300 --> 28:00.667
Poor kid.

28:00.700 --> 28:02.533
So as he's telling the story,
he starts crying...

28:02.567 --> 28:06.500
OH, DID I TELL YOU THAT THE,
