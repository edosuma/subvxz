WEBVTT

00:02.130 --> 00:04.121
- Previously...
- How bad?

00:04.230 --> 00:05.925
- I called DCF
and foster care.

00:05.970 --> 00:07.369
A social worker
is on the way.

00:07.400 --> 00:09.937
- She should stay with us
through her first turn.

00:09.970 --> 00:11.062
(Screaming)

00:11.110 --> 00:12.578
(Growling)

00:12.610 --> 00:14.499
This is Will, my ex.

00:14.540 --> 00:16.599
- He deserved to die.
He burned her.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.778
- Brynn...
- My wolf did terrible things

00:18.810 --> 00:21.245
because I had terrible
things done to me.

00:21.280 --> 00:23.089
(Snarling, screaming)

00:23.120 --> 00:26.215
- A witch brought me back
as what you kissed.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.716
- Can I come back too?

00:27.760 --> 00:29.250
- There's some fine print,

00:29.290 --> 00:32.089
like you kill everybody from
your past that you see.

00:32.130 --> 00:34.292
- Excuse me.
You aren't allowed down here.

00:34.330 --> 00:36.196
- I'll find the
healthy blood.

00:36.230 --> 00:38.267
All you gotta do
is just trust me.

00:38.300 --> 00:40.837
- No, because everyone
who loves you dies.

00:40.870 --> 00:43.703
I have a day, maybe a week.

00:43.740 --> 00:45.469
- Hey, you--

00:54.520 --> 00:56.739
* Yo yo yo yo... *

00:56.790 --> 00:57.882
(Electronic dance)

00:57.920 --> 00:59.354
(Cheering in distance)

01:02.130 --> 01:03.723
- What? What?

01:05.630 --> 01:07.223
- 3:00 a.m.?

01:08.460 --> 01:11.430
Really?

01:11.470 --> 01:13.768
(Woman singing on stereo,
indistinct)

01:13.800 --> 01:15.336
(Sighing)

01:15.370 --> 01:16.440
(Grunts)

01:25.650 --> 01:27.243
(Electronic dance)

01:28.450 --> 01:30.748
- Hello, people
in my house.

01:30.790 --> 01:33.555
- Dude! Hold on
for sec. Excuse me.

01:33.590 --> 01:36.890
Did you know that they
have co-ed fraternities now?

01:36.930 --> 01:38.159
Who saw that
coming, right?

01:38.190 --> 01:39.498
- It's weird, isn't it?

01:39.530 --> 01:42.295
Hosting co-ed kappa kappas
in our house?

01:42.330 --> 01:44.298
Also weird.

01:44.330 --> 01:46.435
(Guests cheering)

01:48.600 --> 01:51.035
- I have to be
awake in 3 hours!

01:51.070 --> 01:53.129
- I know!

01:56.350 --> 01:58.079
No, this is not
happening, OK?

01:58.110 --> 01:59.771
- Twilight was
cool with it.

01:59.820 --> 02:03.211
- Yeah, Aidan was OK with it,
because when he was a teenager,

02:03.250 --> 02:04.809
beer was safer than water.

02:04.850 --> 02:07.854
This is not the Mayflower.
You are not a pilgrim!

02:07.890 --> 02:10.279
Upstairs.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.219
Now!
- Come on, come on!

02:27.440 --> 02:30.546
- Can I talk to you
for a second?

02:30.580 --> 02:31.809
- Yeah!

02:36.690 --> 02:37.987
Go for it!

02:38.020 --> 02:40.990
-Igetit. I like to
drown myself in a keg or three

02:41.020 --> 02:42.954
when one of my
friends dies too.

02:42.990 --> 02:44.628
- Oh! This is not
about Henry.

02:44.660 --> 02:47.595
- OK, you don't wanna talk
about Henry, that's fine.

02:47.630 --> 02:49.496
But don't bring
home takeout, man.

02:49.530 --> 02:51.498
- Don't worry.
I already ate.

02:51.530 --> 02:53.862
- You ate?
Ate what? Ate who?

02:53.900 --> 02:55.698
Did you keep it clean?

03:00.640 --> 03:03.302
- Don't know him.

03:04.110 --> 03:05.600
Don't know her...

03:05.650 --> 03:07.243
Yep!

03:11.050 --> 03:12.279
- You too?

03:12.320 --> 03:13.856
- I can safely say
I did not know

03:13.890 --> 03:15.688
any of these people
before I died.

03:15.720 --> 03:17.859
- That's because they were
all in high school.

03:17.890 --> 03:20.723
Then they grew up and they
joined a co-ed fraternity.

03:22.930 --> 03:24.420
Which is
ridiculous.

03:24.470 --> 03:26.996
- Would you just
let him process?

03:27.040 --> 03:28.530
He just lost
his vamp son.

03:28.570 --> 03:30.368
At least
he's home.

03:30.410 --> 03:33.107
It's better than not
knowing where he is at all.

03:33.140 --> 03:34.904
OK? Calm down!

03:34.940 --> 03:36.203
- Oh my lord!

03:36.250 --> 03:37.547
- Come here! Come here!

03:37.580 --> 03:38.570
Whoo!

03:45.250 --> 03:47.287
(Roaring)

04:25.460 --> 04:27.292
- Great news!

04:27.330 --> 04:31.494
If you're hungry, there are
empty pizza boxes in the fridge.

04:31.530 --> 04:32.565
- Honey.
- Yeah.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.068
- Have you
seen my coat?

04:34.100 --> 04:35.568
- Hey, what
about tonight?

04:35.600 --> 04:37.534
Do you wanna do
something tonight?

04:37.570 --> 04:39.572
Do you wanna go somewhere

04:39.610 --> 04:41.305
that doesn't smell
like beer?

04:41.340 --> 04:43.308
- Uh, I actually
have somewhere

04:43.350 --> 04:44.909
that I have to be
tonight after work.

04:44.950 --> 04:47.874
Are you free to hang out
with Erin tonight?

04:47.920 --> 04:50.309
- So we've adopted
a 15 year old?

04:50.350 --> 04:51.749
(Sighing)

04:51.790 --> 04:53.713
It's cool. I'm not
against adoption.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.252
I just thought that if
we did it, she'd be younger,

04:56.290 --> 04:58.054
perhaps Ugandan.

04:58.090 --> 04:59.592
In all seriousness,

04:59.630 --> 05:01.894
I don't get the impression
she wants our help.

05:01.930 --> 05:04.160
- She doesn't have
anywhere else to go.

05:04.200 --> 05:09.070
It doesn't feel right to just
ask her to leave, you know?

05:09.100 --> 05:11.762
- Yeah, OK.
I'll watch her.

05:11.810 --> 05:12.971
- Thank you.

05:14.240 --> 05:15.605
Bye.

05:15.640 --> 05:19.042
- Bye. Hey, where do
you have to go tonight?

05:19.080 --> 05:21.447
- My parents.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.448
- It's your mom's birthday.

05:24.620 --> 05:26.987
- Yeah, it's the only time
of year I see them.

05:27.020 --> 05:29.921
- I could come with you
and finally meet them.

05:29.960 --> 05:31.951
- No, no. You don't
have to do that.

05:31.990 --> 05:33.856
I have to go

05:33.900 --> 05:36.426
'cause God knows
if I don't bring her cake,

05:36.470 --> 05:37.460
she won't have one.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.059
(Nora chuckles)

05:39.100 --> 05:42.070
Hey! And this?

05:42.100 --> 05:43.761
Not your
responsibility.

05:43.810 --> 05:46.302
Do not clean up
after him.

05:47.110 --> 05:48.578
- I'm not
cleaning up.

05:49.380 --> 05:50.677
I'm not.

06:05.930 --> 06:07.227
(Sighs)

06:07.260 --> 06:09.467
So, it's been over a year

06:09.500 --> 06:12.959
since Nora and I have
been a real couple,

06:13.000 --> 06:16.504
straddling the
human/werewolf divide.

06:16.540 --> 06:19.066
And aside from reviving
the occasional corpse

06:19.110 --> 06:20.475
and worrying about the rent,

06:20.510 --> 06:21.978
it's been amazing.

06:22.010 --> 06:25.310
But she has yet to bring her
parents into the equation

06:25.350 --> 06:28.547
and it's not like they live
in Alaska or Wyoming.

06:28.580 --> 06:30.139
They live in Boston.

06:30.190 --> 06:32.113
- Has she met
your parents yet?

06:32.150 --> 06:36.383
- Yeah, there was a lunch
in the city with my mom

06:36.430 --> 06:38.387
that only required
minimal drinking.

06:38.430 --> 06:40.319
- Maybe it's
a complicated time.

06:40.360 --> 06:42.328
I mean, you're
raising Teen Wolf.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.021
- That is temporary.

06:45.230 --> 06:47.039
And I...

06:48.100 --> 06:50.569
I wanna be with Nora
for the rest of my life,

06:50.610 --> 06:52.704
no matter what.

06:55.640 --> 06:57.540
- Wow.
- Yeah.

06:58.650 --> 07:01.847
Yeah, so I feel like
the right thing to do

07:01.880 --> 07:05.612
is to let her parents
know my intentions, right?

07:05.650 --> 07:09.689
- Well, technically,
the right thing to do

07:09.730 --> 07:12.449
would be to ask
her father's permission.

07:13.860 --> 07:17.728
- Aha. And then demand a cow and
a chest full of silks as dowry.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.932
- No, I'm serious.
There used to be a way

07:19.970 --> 07:21.563
of approaching
these matters.

07:21.600 --> 07:24.831
Courtship, wooing,
asking permission.

07:24.870 --> 07:26.702
Trust me.

07:26.740 --> 07:29.004
- Oh, it's really hard
to take you seriously

07:29.040 --> 07:30.940
when you smell
like Natty Ice.

07:32.620 --> 07:35.578
Also, before you drain
South Boston again...

07:35.620 --> 07:37.611
- I didn't
drain anybody.

07:37.650 --> 07:39.448
- Just keep it clean, OK?

07:39.490 --> 07:43.586
I did some more screening and
this guy didn't get the flu.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.450
This is his name
and address.

07:45.490 --> 07:47.800
- Don't worry about
that anymore, OK?

07:47.830 --> 07:49.867
I don't wanna put you
in that position.

07:49.900 --> 07:53.461
- Aidan, I know
it's been tough adjusting

07:53.500 --> 07:58.233
since your
subterranean ordeal, but...

07:58.270 --> 08:01.433
But don't you think
it's time to jump back in?

08:01.480 --> 08:03.642
To life, to work?

08:03.680 --> 08:07.241
I mean, in all honesty,
we could use the extra income.

08:07.280 --> 08:08.918
Between Sally's
blood-magic bill

08:08.950 --> 08:13.717
and the food and cash that
I try and slip Ray's family,

08:13.760 --> 08:16.582
the supernatural
debt is mounting.

08:17.690 --> 08:19.829
- And so you
got a new car?

08:21.730 --> 08:23.528
- Yeah, yeah,
I got a new car.

08:23.570 --> 08:25.527
Yeah, a werewolf
destroyed my old car

08:25.570 --> 08:27.299
<i>I and the
insurance money--</i>

08:27.340 --> 08:28.592
- It's cool.

08:28.640 --> 08:30.608
- You know what?
This isn't about me.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.506
Your job is waiting.
I covered for you.

08:32.539 --> 08:35.032
They think you were
WWOOFing in Australia.

08:35.080 --> 08:37.344
- They think I was what?
- WWOOFing.

08:37.380 --> 08:39.269
Uh, working on organic--

08:39.309 --> 08:41.369
Listen, the only
thing that matters

08:41.419 --> 08:43.081
is that they'll
take you back.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.781
Recertification
tests are tomorrow.

08:44.820 --> 08:46.754
If you get your
paperwork in, in time--

08:46.790 --> 08:49.054
- I don't want to take
blood from the hospital.

08:49.090 --> 08:51.184
Most of it
is tainted anyway.

08:52.190 --> 08:53.692
- Come on, man.

08:53.730 --> 08:56.199
That was never the
reason you worked there.

08:56.230 --> 08:58.995
You always told me
it was about penance,

08:59.030 --> 09:01.362
about helping people
through their pain,

09:01.400 --> 09:04.802
and about spending time in
a place where vampires weren't.

09:06.840 --> 09:09.844
- Well, I guess I don't have
to worry about that anymore.

09:09.880 --> 09:12.042
Virus wiped them out.

09:13.050 --> 09:14.575
Hmm?

09:17.150 --> 09:19.187
(Bird chirping)

09:23.090 --> 09:25.889
(Car honking)

09:28.200 --> 09:29.827
- Sally?

09:29.870 --> 09:31.668
No way!
Sally Malik?

09:31.700 --> 09:33.794
- Oh no. No.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.695
- Sally, is that you?

09:35.740 --> 09:37.401
- Sally?
- Where have you been?

09:37.440 --> 09:39.135
- Sally, where have you been?

09:39.170 --> 09:41.070
- You guys can't be here.
Please go away!

09:41.110 --> 09:42.942
You're not supposed
to be here!

09:42.980 --> 09:44.209
Please, no!

09:44.250 --> 09:46.571
No, no! Please!

09:46.620 --> 09:49.043
Please, please!
Please, please.

09:49.080 --> 09:51.412
(Gasping)

09:51.450 --> 09:53.612
(Siren in distance)

10:00.460 --> 10:02.098
(Sighing)

10:08.440 --> 10:10.704
- So, what are
you again?

10:10.740 --> 10:11.969
- I'm a reanimated corpse

10:12.010 --> 10:14.206
brought back from
the dead by a spell.

10:14.240 --> 10:15.708
But I'm cursed,

10:15.740 --> 10:18.903
so anyone I see that knew me
when I was alive dies.

10:19.950 --> 10:21.042
- Huh!

10:21.080 --> 10:24.846
But are you, like,
a person again?

10:24.890 --> 10:27.086
- Yeah, I'm a person.

10:28.090 --> 10:29.080
I think.

10:29.120 --> 10:31.760
- Did you get
a new identity yet?

10:31.790 --> 10:33.849
You can't do anything
without one of those.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.119
Trust me, I've tried.

10:36.160 --> 10:39.494
- How does one get
a new identity?

10:39.530 --> 10:40.793
Seriously,
who does that?

10:40.840 --> 10:42.296
- More people
than you think.

10:42.340 --> 10:46.208
You can't be Sally whatever-
ethnic-last-name again.

10:46.240 --> 10:47.878
She's dead.

10:47.910 --> 10:50.709
- Yeah, that word means so many
different things these days.

10:50.750 --> 10:54.118
- So you're a cursed,
undead hottie

10:54.150 --> 10:56.448
with no identity.

10:56.480 --> 10:58.084
- All of which
would be fine

10:58.120 --> 11:01.750
if I hadn't grown up in Boston,
went to school in Boston

11:01.790 --> 11:04.987
and shacked up with
my psycho fianc in Boston.

11:05.030 --> 11:06.486
- So leave.

11:06.530 --> 11:07.952
(Scoffing)

11:08.000 --> 11:10.822
- Leave?
I can't just...

11:12.570 --> 11:14.129
leave.

11:14.170 --> 11:16.468
- Fine. Stay.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.207
Kill people.

11:25.280 --> 11:26.577
- Hi.

11:26.610 --> 11:27.771
(Bird squawking)

11:27.820 --> 11:29.117
- Hey, what are
you doing here?

11:29.150 --> 11:30.948
I thought you
weren't working today.

11:30.990 --> 11:32.640
- I'm not.
Do you have a second?

11:32.690 --> 11:33.657
- Where's Erin?

11:33.690 --> 11:35.283
- She's with Sally.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.651
- And Aidan.

11:36.690 --> 11:38.249
- Listen, I know he's
been erratic lately,

11:38.290 --> 11:40.019
but he's not gonna
eat Erin, OK?

11:40.060 --> 11:42.995
Werewolf blood doesn't
exactly agree with him.

11:43.030 --> 11:43.929
(Sighing)

11:43.970 --> 11:46.530
I wanna go with
you tonight.

11:46.570 --> 11:48.038
- No, Josh...

11:48.070 --> 11:50.437
- I know you think that
your family won't like me.

11:50.470 --> 11:51.665
- No, I never said that.

11:51.710 --> 11:53.929
- So we'll get on
like gangbusters.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.232
- I never said that.

11:55.280 --> 11:57.203
- Listen, this is
what people in love do.

11:57.250 --> 12:00.880
They meet each other's families
and they get mercilessly judged.

12:00.920 --> 12:03.639
- Josh, it's not you that
I'm worried about, OK?

12:03.690 --> 12:05.249
Trust me.

12:05.290 --> 12:06.644
It's my family.

12:06.690 --> 12:10.228
They're really tough.

12:10.260 --> 12:12.126
And I--T just don't
want to burden you

12:12.160 --> 12:13.696
with that part
of my life.

12:13.730 --> 12:15.721
- I understand. I get it.
It's like my mantra.

12:15.760 --> 12:19.060
But your family is
a part of who you are.

12:19.100 --> 12:20.693
And I want to
know that part.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.868
I want to know
everything about you.

12:31.350 --> 12:32.579
I'm coming with you.

12:32.610 --> 12:34.476
(Chuckling)

12:34.520 --> 12:36.784
- OK.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.685
(Siren in distance)

12:41.520 --> 12:43.352
- Ah!
- Jeez!

12:43.390 --> 12:46.155
- God, finally. What are you,
turning into a bat person?

12:46.190 --> 12:47.851
- Why didn't you
just come down?

12:47.900 --> 12:50.289
- I don't know what
dark arts you're doing there.

12:50.330 --> 12:51.161
Where you going?
- Out.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.520
- I need to
talk to you.

12:52.570 --> 12:54.265
- You know what?
You can come with.

12:54.300 --> 12:56.234
- Aw...
- Come on, it could be fun.

12:56.270 --> 12:58.864
- Yeah, until I accidentally
murder my familiars.

12:58.910 --> 13:00.730
- All right.
Well, how about this?

13:00.780 --> 13:03.101
We'll go somewhere
where the old Sally Malik

13:03.150 --> 13:04.675
wouldn't be
caught dead in.

13:04.710 --> 13:06.576
- And where exactly
would that be?

13:06.610 --> 13:08.817
(Heavy metal)

13:16.190 --> 13:19.080
This place smells
like hempseed.

13:22.360 --> 13:23.828
Thanks.

13:26.870 --> 13:28.463
Their drinks
come in bowls.

13:28.500 --> 13:29.535
- Yep.

13:29.570 --> 13:31.106
- Best place ever.

13:31.140 --> 13:34.235
- Aw, man. You know, this place
wasn't always a bar.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.772
29 years ago, this was
the best ramen joint

13:36.810 --> 13:38.699
on the Eastern
Seaboard.

13:38.750 --> 13:40.570
- So you were in Boston
back then too?

13:40.620 --> 13:42.213
- Yeah.

13:42.250 --> 13:43.149
- And you ate.

13:43.190 --> 13:44.919
- It was really
good ramen.

13:44.950 --> 13:47.089
- Must've been.

13:48.360 --> 13:50.681
(Rumbling)

13:50.730 --> 13:52.482
- Let me ask
you something.

13:52.530 --> 13:54.589
How do you reset
your identity?

13:54.630 --> 13:57.292
You can't be the same
person for 260 years, right?

13:57.330 --> 14:01.233
- Well, the vampires
had a system.

14:01.270 --> 14:03.329
Um, when we
needed new names,

14:03.370 --> 14:06.533
we had people in
place to make it happen.

14:06.570 --> 14:09.107
- LIHadll?

14:09.140 --> 14:11.199
Oh, right.

14:11.250 --> 14:14.174
So what would they do
to get you new names?

14:14.220 --> 14:17.520
- They'd do a lot of things,
but I guess the simplest thing

14:17.550 --> 14:20.190
is they would steal
social security numbers

14:20.220 --> 14:22.416
from the diseased,
ideally infants.

14:22.460 --> 14:23.825
Nobody checks up
on those.

14:23.860 --> 14:24.827
(Whimpers)

14:24.860 --> 14:25.850
- That's cold.

14:25.890 --> 14:28.154
- It worked.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.924
- And, um,

14:30.970 --> 14:34.691
have you ever had
to cut and run?

14:35.670 --> 14:38.207
- You always have
to be ready to cut and run.

14:38.240 --> 14:40.800
You can't invest
too much in anything...

14:41.610 --> 14:43.078
or anyone.

14:43.110 --> 14:45.169
- You can't really mean that.

14:46.750 --> 14:49.310
(Swing)

14:50.450 --> 14:52.111
I chose this one for you.

14:52.150 --> 14:54.312
Grandpa music
for the old guy.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.322
- OK.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.720
See what I'm doing here?
- Uh-huh.

15:02.760 --> 15:04.398
- Can you keep up?
- Yeah, OK.

15:04.430 --> 15:05.397
Whoa!

15:05.430 --> 15:06.932
Aaah!

15:06.970 --> 15:08.734
(Sally laughing)

15:21.350 --> 15:23.739
(Heart beating)

15:38.700 --> 15:40.293
- (Josh):
It's gonna be fine.

15:41.400 --> 15:44.131
- Were you just gonna
stand here or...

15:45.910 --> 15:47.833
- I feel better
knowing where she is.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.837
- I know. I know.
I get that.

15:49.880 --> 15:52.577
I--I have a delinquent
little sister.

15:52.610 --> 15:55.216
Can't we just leave her
in the car, crack a window?

15:55.250 --> 15:57.514
- She's not a dog.
- I kind of am.

15:57.550 --> 16:00.281
Look, I'll stay in your
sweet-ass car, no problem.

16:00.320 --> 16:02.516
It's nicer than most of
my foster homes.

16:02.560 --> 16:06.121
- Oh my God! You're not
staying in the car.

16:06.160 --> 16:07.719
All right.
Let's do this.

16:07.760 --> 16:09.091
- Yeah.

16:10.900 --> 16:13.267
I think I know
what you just did.

16:13.300 --> 16:14.893
Really?

16:14.940 --> 16:17.329
- It's gonna
be great.

16:17.370 --> 16:18.929
- Yeah.

16:18.970 --> 16:21.029
- It's gonna be great.

16:26.780 --> 16:28.475
Hey, RJ!

16:28.520 --> 16:29.646
- Hey, stranger!

16:29.680 --> 16:30.647
- Hey!

16:30.690 --> 16:31.885
- Come on in!

16:32.720 --> 16:34.085
So, Mom's birthday, huh?

16:34.120 --> 16:36.509
You brought friends?
That's brave.

16:36.560 --> 16:39.154
- (Man on TV): ...get over here
quickly enough.

16:39.190 --> 16:40.658
Really good play...

16:40.700 --> 16:41.895
- Hey, Dad.

16:43.470 --> 16:47.361
Guys, this is
my Dad, Robert,

16:47.400 --> 16:49.539
and my not-so-little
brother, RJ.

16:49.570 --> 16:50.901
RJ, this is Josh and--

16:50.940 --> 16:51.930
- (Mother): Nora?

16:51.970 --> 16:53.836
- How's it going?
- Hey.

16:54.810 --> 16:55.777
- Hey!

16:55.810 --> 16:57.300
- You camel!

16:57.350 --> 16:59.045
Can't believe it.

16:59.880 --> 17:01.075
And you brought...

17:01.120 --> 17:02.918
- Oh, uh, this is
my boyfriend, Josh.

17:02.950 --> 17:04.145
- I'm Josh.

17:05.220 --> 17:06.915
It's nice
to meet you.

17:06.950 --> 17:08.588
- And his cousin, Erin.

17:08.619 --> 17:12.250
- Robert, say hello
to Nora's friends.

17:12.290 --> 17:15.657
- McCain is a tough, smart kid
out of Houston,

17:15.700 --> 17:16.929
recruited by Stanford...

17:16.960 --> 17:18.064
(Clearing throat)

17:18.099 --> 17:19.329
- Happy birthday.

17:19.369 --> 17:22.396
- Oh! No, you really
shouldn't have.

17:22.440 --> 17:24.534
Well, I wasn't
expecting so many.

17:24.569 --> 17:27.278
- I-- Sorry, I tried calling,
but nobody answered.

17:27.310 --> 17:30.940
- RJ's always hogging the phone
line with the damn Internet.

17:30.980 --> 17:32.175
- Dialup!

17:34.720 --> 17:35.949
Yeah, that's cool.

17:35.980 --> 17:38.540
It's cool too,
like call waiting.

17:38.590 --> 17:40.183
Smart cars are dumb.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.282
(Whispering):
Those are dumb.

17:45.330 --> 17:46.729
- Why don't you have a seat?

17:46.760 --> 17:49.923
Gonna have to make something
extra so there's enough.

17:49.960 --> 17:53.134
- OK. Do you wanna...

17:55.370 --> 17:57.099
- Yes.

17:58.410 --> 17:59.400
Uh...

17:59.440 --> 18:00.601
- Yep. Uh-huh.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.779
Yeah, another one
for the lady. For me too.

18:02.810 --> 18:05.973
You know what? On second
thought, shots for everyone!

18:06.010 --> 18:07.216
(Cheering)

18:07.250 --> 18:09.014
- That's what I want!
Let's do a shot.

18:09.050 --> 18:11.485
- (Sally):
That is very nice.

18:11.520 --> 18:14.490
(Man singing blues
on stereo, indistinct)

18:19.660 --> 18:22.095
Can I just say I feel
weird making a toast

18:22.130 --> 18:24.861
if you're gonna bring back
these people to our house

18:24.900 --> 18:26.095
and eat them?

18:26.130 --> 18:27.495
- You said you
wanted to have fun.

18:27.540 --> 18:30.840
- I do, but it's not fun sending
you into a sea of virus blood.

18:30.870 --> 18:31.837
- I'm fine.

18:31.870 --> 18:33.008
- Seriously, Josh and I

18:33.040 --> 18:34.576
are worried about you.

18:34.610 --> 18:35.577
- I'm fine.

18:35.610 --> 18:36.634
To life!

18:36.680 --> 18:37.841
- (Man): Cheers!

18:37.880 --> 18:39.075
- Hmm?

18:46.150 --> 18:47.549
- Clock ticking its way...

18:47.590 --> 18:49.911
- What's he doing
in the kitchen?

18:49.960 --> 18:51.485
- Josh likes being helpful.

18:51.530 --> 18:56.354
And honestly,
he's a really good cook.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.061
- Cook.

18:58.100 --> 19:00.125
(Men shouting on TV)

19:01.870 --> 19:04.100
- You're a fan, huh?

19:04.140 --> 19:06.905
- Yeah, I usually hang in
the lot during games.

19:06.940 --> 19:08.908
- You tailgate?
Get out. Me too.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.840
My buddies are out
there right now,

19:10.880 --> 19:12.541
but Mom's birthday, so...

19:12.580 --> 19:14.014
- Drag.

19:14.050 --> 19:17.042
- Nah, it's not
so bad this time.

19:17.850 --> 19:19.340
(Man on TV talking, indistinct)

19:19.390 --> 19:23.258
- Nora, guess who I saw at the
grocery market yesterday.

19:24.060 --> 19:26.051
Will's mother, Patty.

19:26.090 --> 19:28.127
She was always
so fond of you.

19:29.930 --> 19:33.639
- How is she, uh,
how is she coping?

19:33.670 --> 19:36.037
(Snarling, screaming)

19:37.100 --> 19:40.206
- It's been so hard
on her, losing him.

19:40.240 --> 19:43.039
You know, we took up a
collection for her at church

19:43.080 --> 19:44.570
right after
it happened.

19:44.610 --> 19:47.318
She couldn't afford a headstone
for that poor boy.

19:49.820 --> 19:51.515
You know, he was
just starting

19:51.550 --> 19:54.019
to turn things around
for himself.

19:55.090 --> 19:56.751
It's such a shame.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.095
- What the
hell was that?

20:05.130 --> 20:06.427
(Sighing)

20:06.470 --> 20:09.189
I just--I just
don't understand.

20:09.240 --> 20:11.732
"That poor boy"?
Nora, I know she's your mom--

20:11.770 --> 20:13.101
- They don't know.

20:13.140 --> 20:14.539
They don't know.

20:14.580 --> 20:18.869
I mean, I'm sure
to some degree they do,

20:18.910 --> 20:21.413
but they don't know what
put me in the hospital.

20:21.450 --> 20:24.010
And we don't speak
ill of the dead,

20:24.050 --> 20:26.542
especially the ones
that we killed.

20:27.820 --> 20:30.687
- You have to stop blaming
yourself for that.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.255
You weren't you.

20:32.290 --> 20:35.726
- But I was, Josh.

20:35.760 --> 20:37.626
You refuse
to see it,

20:37.670 --> 20:41.061
because you'll always look for
the good in people you love.

20:41.100 --> 20:43.467
But you have
to accept

20:43.510 --> 20:48.607
that I did terrible,
unforgiveable things.

20:48.640 --> 20:49.607
- I do accept it.

20:49.640 --> 20:52.405
I accepted what
happened to Will.

20:53.250 --> 20:55.309
- It wasn't just Will.

21:01.590 --> 21:03.752
<i>(Man on stereo).
* I had my chances</i>

21:03.790 --> 21:06.054
* Though they were few

21:09.260 --> 21:11.763

21:15.170 --> 21:18.470

21:19.340 --> 21:21.206
- Here you go, pal.

21:21.240 --> 21:25.143
* Walking now in
a dead man's shoe *

21:30.920 --> 21:34.709

21:57.980 --> 21:59.869
Aidan.

21:59.910 --> 22:00.911
Oh my God!

22:00.950 --> 22:03.544
(Groaning)

22:03.590 --> 22:05.547
- Hey! Hey, give me
your phone!

22:05.590 --> 22:08.116
Give me your phone!
I need to call 911!

22:10.930 --> 22:12.625
(Groaning)

22:14.730 --> 22:17.859
- You haven't asked me
about what happened to Brynn,

22:19.870 --> 22:21.929
and I'm grateful for that.

22:21.970 --> 22:23.040
But you need to know.

22:23.070 --> 22:24.538
- Nora.

22:24.570 --> 22:27.801
- We argued a couple nights
before the full moon.

22:27.840 --> 22:32.175
She was hanging onto some guy
that she met on the road,

22:32.210 --> 22:35.874
that she wanted to,
I don't know,

22:35.920 --> 22:39.447
play with during the turn,

22:39.490 --> 22:42.209
like--like a mouse.

22:42.260 --> 22:43.489
(Sighs)

22:43.530 --> 22:45.680
I tried to
get him out.

22:47.230 --> 22:48.720
But she fought me.

22:48.760 --> 22:52.094
<i>1-- I had to protect
myself, Josh.</i>

22:52.130 --> 22:54.633
(Sighing)

22:54.670 --> 22:57.332
But I was stronger
than I thought.

23:00.840 --> 23:02.808
So now you know...

23:02.840 --> 23:04.649
(Crickets chirping)

23:04.680 --> 23:08.218
...that it wasn't just Will
who I killed.

23:09.350 --> 23:11.341
I didn't want
to tell you.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.789
With Liam sniffing around,

23:12.820 --> 23:15.812
I thought that the less
you knew, the better.

23:17.930 --> 23:21.230
He told me that
he could smell my fear.

23:21.260 --> 23:24.366
- I won't let anything
happen to you.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.823
- I killed his daughter.

23:26.870 --> 23:28.895
- You had no choice.

23:29.670 --> 23:32.435
- I could've stayed with you.

23:36.780 --> 23:40.546
- Last year,
what I did to Ray...

23:41.950 --> 23:44.487
you didn't
judge me then.

23:45.650 --> 23:48.210
And I refuse to
judge you now.

23:49.760 --> 23:53.799
You think that
I have blinders on,

23:53.830 --> 23:55.855
but I see.

23:55.900 --> 23:58.119
I see you.

23:58.170 --> 23:59.820
I see all of you.

24:01.300 --> 24:02.665
And I love you.

24:12.050 --> 24:14.348
(Car honking)

24:22.390 --> 24:23.585
(Gasps)

24:25.060 --> 24:26.550
(Laughing)

24:36.070 --> 24:37.367
(Whimpers)

24:44.250 --> 24:46.002
(Siren in distance,
car honking)

24:46.880 --> 24:48.974
- OK, first of all,
you ditched me.

24:49.020 --> 24:51.648
That I get. We all
have things to do.

24:51.690 --> 24:55.285
But when things involve me
calling the paramedics,

24:55.320 --> 24:58.358
to pick up your
leftovers, not OK.

24:58.390 --> 24:59.755
- I didn't
drain him.

24:59.790 --> 25:00.825
- Aidan, you ass.

25:00.860 --> 25:03.022
You don't know
if he was sick or not.

25:03.060 --> 25:04.528
His blood could kill you.

25:04.570 --> 25:07.460
What are you, like, not
even screening people now?

25:07.500 --> 25:08.899
- I rolled the dice.

25:08.940 --> 25:11.705
- So what? We just--
we just wait a couple days

25:11.740 --> 25:13.629
and see if you live or not?

25:13.680 --> 25:14.533
Aidan!

25:14.580 --> 25:16.969
Aidan, this
is not a game.

25:17.010 --> 25:18.171
(Door slams)

25:18.210 --> 25:19.177
(Sighing)

25:19.210 --> 25:22.043
Oh, cool. OK.

25:23.150 --> 25:26.688
(Dog barking in distance
and crickets chirping)

25:27.820 --> 25:29.515
- Hey.

25:29.560 --> 25:32.052
No, thanks.
I don't--

25:32.090 --> 25:34.297
Thanks, but no thanks.

25:38.670 --> 25:42.368
Mr. Sergeant, I just want--
I just want to, uh, tell you

25:42.400 --> 25:45.301
that your daughter has...

25:46.410 --> 25:48.139
changed my life.

25:48.180 --> 25:50.569
She's truly an
amazing woman.

25:52.650 --> 25:55.278
(Train horn blaring
in distance)

25:58.520 --> 26:01.387
- Beat all the boys
in the 10-yard dash.

26:02.260 --> 26:03.750
I remember that.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.862
- Well, um, I would--

26:11.900 --> 26:16.030
Uh, I would like
to take this opportunity

26:16.070 --> 26:18.334
here in your home

26:18.370 --> 26:21.305
to formally ask
your permission...

26:22.810 --> 26:25.905
to ask for your
daughter's hand in marriage.

26:29.320 --> 26:31.539
- (Mother):
Robert, cake!

26:34.360 --> 26:35.680
(Sniffs)

26:35.720 --> 26:39.623
- Well, you know
what they say.

26:41.060 --> 26:42.892
Take a look at the mother.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.489
It's your choice.

26:59.750 --> 27:03.812
- Nora, your family's
messed up.

27:05.590 --> 27:08.082
Not that I'm one to talk.

27:12.330 --> 27:15.823
- (Josh): I totally think we
should invite your dad over

27:15.860 --> 27:17.055
for Passover.

27:41.090 --> 27:43.411
- So you wanna die?

27:44.190 --> 27:45.680
I get it.

27:45.730 --> 27:48.449
Let's do this
right here, right now.

27:58.310 --> 28:00.267
- Sally, put it down.

28:00.310 --> 28:01.277
- No.

28:01.310 --> 28:02.675
You keep acting this way,

28:02.710 --> 28:05.407
you're gonna end up
sick just like Henry.

28:06.250 --> 28:07.672
- You don't get it.

28:07.720 --> 28:10.576
There is no good way
of doing this.

28:10.620 --> 28:13.783
- Josh is screening people.
He's given you names.

28:13.820 --> 28:14.958
- Sure.

28:14.990 --> 28:17.584
Then at any second,
with any handshake,

28:17.620 --> 28:20.328
a door handle,
railing or cough,

28:20.360 --> 28:22.954
that source goes
from safe to unsafe.

28:23.000 --> 28:27.426
This disease, it's everywhere.
There are no guarantees.

28:27.470 --> 28:29.234
- So you wanna die.

28:29.270 --> 28:31.204
You've given up?

28:31.240 --> 28:32.799
Admit it.

28:32.840 --> 28:35.935
Just don't pretend that what
you're doing is the only option.

28:35.980 --> 28:37.300
- But it is.

28:37.340 --> 28:39.775
It's all I have left.

28:39.810 --> 28:41.073
(Scoffs)

28:41.120 --> 28:43.077
He knew how to survive.

28:43.120 --> 28:45.487
He had survived

28:45.520 --> 28:48.057
for 80 years on his own.

28:48.090 --> 28:51.424
This disease comes,
he has a system,

28:51.460 --> 28:54.953
and I ruined it.

28:59.400 --> 29:00.993
I killed him.

29:02.600 --> 29:05.900
My way killed him.

29:07.670 --> 29:09.832
My way kills everyone.

29:13.250 --> 29:16.220
- Aidan, I know you didn't
want to lose Henry,

29:16.250 --> 29:17.809
but the rest of them,

29:17.850 --> 29:20.956
you said that all you wanted
was to be free of vampires.

29:20.990 --> 29:22.958
That's all you've
been fighting for.

29:22.990 --> 29:25.220
- You don't think that
I see the irony in that?

29:25.260 --> 29:27.558
I wanted my freedom to
live as a better man,

29:27.590 --> 29:29.558
I get the apocalypse.

29:29.600 --> 29:32.592
And now, I am...

29:34.000 --> 29:35.661
alone.

29:35.700 --> 29:38.704
- Alone? You're alone?

29:38.740 --> 29:42.404
What about me and Josh?
We used to be enough.

29:43.210 --> 29:45.372
I'm sorry you didn't
get your freedom

29:45.410 --> 29:46.775
exactly the way
you wanted it.

29:46.810 --> 29:49.450
You know what? I'm sorry
I didn't get my body back

29:49.480 --> 29:50.641
with no strings
attached,

29:50.680 --> 29:52.045
but that's just
how it goes.

29:52.090 --> 29:54.559
Nora is a werewolf
and Josh isn't.

29:54.590 --> 29:57.457
We all have problems
and we're still here.

29:57.490 --> 30:01.051
- Yeah, and last night you were
asking me all these questions

30:01.100 --> 30:02.659
about cutting
and running.

30:02.700 --> 30:04.919
It's pretty clear
what you're planning.

30:04.970 --> 30:08.691
Josh and Nora, you know how long
until they're out of the house,

30:08.740 --> 30:10.435
having a family
of their own?

30:10.470 --> 30:12.268
What then?

30:14.180 --> 30:16.000
(Sniffling)

30:17.040 --> 30:19.145
(Shuddering)

30:19.180 --> 30:21.512
- I don't know
what my plan is yet.

30:27.390 --> 30:29.154
(Sighing)

30:29.190 --> 30:32.057
I just know I can't
stay like this.

30:32.090 --> 30:35.060
I need to become
a person again.

30:35.100 --> 30:37.865
(Sighing)

30:41.770 --> 30:44.159
I'm not going anywhere yet.

30:45.170 --> 30:46.729
And Josh, come on,

30:46.770 --> 30:48.829
after everything you
guys have been through,

30:48.880 --> 30:51.906
you gotta be an idiot to think
that he'd ever abandon you.

30:51.950 --> 30:54.146
(Sighing)

30:56.850 --> 30:58.909
You are not alone.

31:00.450 --> 31:02.680
But you're being
a douche bag.

31:02.720 --> 31:04.529
(Sniffling)

31:04.560 --> 31:05.789
- Yeah.

31:05.830 --> 31:07.355
(Chuckling):
Got it.

31:07.390 --> 31:08.949
(Sighing)

31:12.030 --> 31:15.694
Oh, and, uh,
for the record,

31:15.740 --> 31:18.266
Uh, if you're gonna
kill a vampire,

31:18.310 --> 31:20.802
it's more here.

31:23.180 --> 31:24.602
OK?

31:24.650 --> 31:27.005
* Everything I work for

31:27.050 --> 31:30.645
* Everything is now gone

31:30.680 --> 31:33.980
* I feel it like a headache

31:34.790 --> 31:37.259
* Sleep until it's all gone

31:38.260 --> 31:40.251
* All gone

31:50.940 --> 31:54.433
* Decision that got you here

31:54.480 --> 31:57.609
* Take you so far away

31:57.640 --> 32:00.769
* Miles of road to burn

32:00.810 --> 32:04.713
* Speeding a life away *

32:18.100 --> 32:20.023
(Knocking)

32:21.940 --> 32:23.430
- Hey!
- RJ!

32:23.470 --> 32:25.029
- Congratulations!

32:25.070 --> 32:27.129
- What? What are
you doing here?

32:27.170 --> 32:28.979
How do you even
know where I live?

32:29.010 --> 32:32.310
- You send Mom Christmas cards.
I know how to read.

32:32.350 --> 32:34.944
Hey, so Pop told me
the great news!

32:34.980 --> 32:36.243
I'm here
to celebrate.

32:36.280 --> 32:37.372
- What news?

32:37.420 --> 32:39.582
- Um, the little guy
popped the question.

32:39.620 --> 32:42.089
Come on, let's see.
Show me the rock.

32:42.120 --> 32:45.385
- What? No, RJ, Josh
and I are not engaged.

32:46.630 --> 32:49.827
- Oh crap! Aw!
Are you dumping him?

32:49.860 --> 32:52.500
- No! No! I--I--

32:52.530 --> 32:55.659
No, I just-- I didn't know
that he would want that.

32:55.700 --> 32:57.168
- That guy with you?

32:57.200 --> 33:00.329
He'd be insane not to
lock that down, no offense.

33:00.370 --> 33:02.873
- Don't be an idiot.

33:02.910 --> 33:06.801
And honestly, this,
we don't do this.

33:07.650 --> 33:09.675
- It's all good.

33:09.720 --> 33:11.609
I'll go.

33:11.650 --> 33:13.379
(Bottles clinking)

33:13.420 --> 33:14.910
- Stop. Stop.

33:14.960 --> 33:16.883
God, how many
have you had?

33:16.920 --> 33:19.423
- Two on the
way up here...

33:19.460 --> 33:21.155
- Just give me this.

33:21.200 --> 33:22.224
(Sighing)

33:22.260 --> 33:23.659
Come here.

33:24.700 --> 33:26.293
Sit down.

33:26.330 --> 33:27.491
We're out of coffee.

33:27.530 --> 33:29.669
I'm gonna run to the
store and get some, OK?

33:29.700 --> 33:32.533
I'll be right back.

33:32.570 --> 33:33.662
Don't move.

33:33.710 --> 33:35.109
(Sighing)

33:36.740 --> 33:40.005
- (Woman on TV):
What's going on?

33:40.050 --> 33:43.213
- (Man): I'll let you
explain it to her.

33:43.250 --> 33:45.344
- Hey there, Tailgate!
- Hey!

33:45.390 --> 33:46.915
What are you doing here?

33:48.890 --> 33:50.358
- You want one?

33:53.360 --> 33:55.249
- I probably shouldn't.

33:55.300 --> 33:57.189
- Aw, come on.
What is she gonna do?

33:57.230 --> 34:00.666
OK, Nora's been drinking since
she was way younger than you.

34:00.700 --> 34:02.634
- How old do you
think I am?

34:02.670 --> 34:04.035
(Chuckles)

34:04.070 --> 34:06.368
- There's no right answer
to that question.

34:07.370 --> 34:08.804
(Chuckles)

34:08.840 --> 34:10.706
- Not here.

34:22.989 --> 34:25.049
(Bird chirping)

34:27.560 --> 34:29.824
(Car honking)

34:41.980 --> 34:45.280
- Come on,
Dead babies, dead babies.

34:51.820 --> 34:54.208
- You know, when I said
you could stop by

34:54.260 --> 34:57.013
this wasn't what
I had in mind.

34:58.590 --> 35:00.456
(Cheering on TV)

35:00.490 --> 35:03.130
(Man on TV, indistinct)

35:08.440 --> 35:10.238
- Nora?

35:10.270 --> 35:11.567
(Erin giggling)

35:11.610 --> 35:14.170
- (Erin): Oh my God!
You drank, like, half the case!

35:14.210 --> 35:16.429
- (RJ): Well, there's
enough left for you.

35:16.480 --> 35:17.732
(Erin giggling)

35:17.780 --> 35:19.646
Whatever. Why don't
you just have one?

35:19.680 --> 35:20.806
- Thanks.

35:20.850 --> 35:22.579
- Forget about
them, seriously.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.042
- Erin?

35:31.330 --> 35:33.150
- Don't you knock?

35:34.630 --> 35:36.553
- Get the hell off of her!

35:36.600 --> 35:37.920
- Why'd you do that?

35:37.960 --> 35:39.769
- She's 15 years old,
you son of a bitch!

35:39.800 --> 35:41.097
- Josh! Stop.
It's OK.

35:41.130 --> 35:43.098
- And you let him do this?

35:43.140 --> 35:45.609
What the hell
is wrong with you?

35:45.640 --> 35:48.530
- Get out of my house.
Get the hell out of my house.

35:48.580 --> 35:50.435
Get out right now.

35:50.480 --> 35:52.403
(Groans)

35:57.380 --> 35:58.916
(Both grunting)

36:04.530 --> 36:05.827
- What's going on here?

36:05.860 --> 36:07.749
What's going on? Stop it!

36:07.790 --> 36:10.225
What is going on?

36:10.260 --> 36:11.659
Oh my God!

36:11.700 --> 36:16.137
- I came in and he practically
had Erin pinned on the bed.

36:16.170 --> 36:17.797
- I didn't do anything.

36:17.840 --> 36:19.365
- Like hell
you didn't!

36:19.410 --> 36:22.710
- We were talking. Josh came in
and started punching him.

36:22.740 --> 36:25.107
(Nora panting)

36:25.150 --> 36:27.369
- I see your taste in men
hasn't changed.

36:27.410 --> 36:29.174
<i>- Leave!</i>

36:29.220 --> 36:30.915
Now! Get out
of here!

36:30.950 --> 36:32.384
Come on, get out!

36:34.050 --> 36:35.984
Just get out!

36:37.890 --> 36:39.585
Oh my God!

36:47.970 --> 36:50.268
- What exactly were
you looking for?

36:50.300 --> 36:51.665
- Um...

36:52.710 --> 36:55.407
OK, you know that movie,
Sleeping With The Enemy?

36:55.440 --> 36:58.171
Julia Roberts,
secret swimming lessons?

36:58.210 --> 36:59.177
(Grunts)

36:59.210 --> 37:01.099
No? Really?
- Mm-mmm.

37:01.150 --> 37:04.347
- OK, um,
for reasons,

37:04.390 --> 37:06.848
for very, very
valid reasons...

37:09.390 --> 37:11.927
I have to hide
from my past.

37:15.100 --> 37:17.250
- So my files were--

37:17.300 --> 37:20.668
What, were you looking
for a new identity?

37:20.700 --> 37:22.031
Is that the idea?

37:22.070 --> 37:25.529
- Yeah, um, I shouldn't
even be in Boston,

37:25.570 --> 37:30.030
but um, I need to be.

37:31.580 --> 37:32.741
It's complicated. I--

37:32.780 --> 37:34.202
(Sighing)

37:34.250 --> 37:36.571
And just being here
without an identity, it's...

37:39.950 --> 37:42.260
- Paralyzing?

37:42.290 --> 37:44.657
- Yeah.

37:44.690 --> 37:46.920
- OK.

37:46.960 --> 37:48.598
- OK.

37:48.630 --> 37:50.655
- No, I--I believe you.

37:50.700 --> 37:51.963
- You do?

37:52.000 --> 37:53.968
- Well, you know,
a job like this,

37:54.000 --> 37:56.094
you tend to see people
at their worst.

37:56.140 --> 37:57.437
Yeah, you gotta
be willing

37:57.470 --> 37:59.700
to give people the
benefit of the doubt.

37:59.740 --> 38:02.072
Otherwise, it'll crush you.

38:02.110 --> 38:04.977
- So, you're not gonna have
me led away in shackles?

38:05.010 --> 38:08.469
- Uh, are you putting me
in danger being here?

38:08.520 --> 38:10.409
- No.

38:10.450 --> 38:12.088
- And the identity,
that's for...

38:12.120 --> 38:13.884
- Money, I guess.
I don't know.

38:13.920 --> 38:18.255
Uh, the ability to rent a car
and book it to Canada.

38:18.290 --> 38:21.590
I don't know.
Like, security.

38:23.260 --> 38:25.797
- All right, well,
the identity's kind of sketchy,

38:25.830 --> 38:27.468
but like,
the money we can do.

38:28.600 --> 38:29.999
You start tomorrow.

38:30.040 --> 38:31.701
- Start what?

38:31.740 --> 38:33.230
- Your job here.

38:33.270 --> 38:37.571
It's not gonna be pretty, right,
but I can pay you cash.

38:37.610 --> 38:39.749
- You--you want me
to work here?

38:39.780 --> 38:41.179
That's what you're asking?

38:41.210 --> 38:43.144
You're not
offering me cash

38:43.180 --> 38:44.989
to assassinate people
or anything?

38:45.020 --> 38:46.613
- No.

38:46.650 --> 38:49.984
Just drain corpses
and stuff like that.

38:50.020 --> 38:52.227
- Oh.

38:53.860 --> 38:55.521
Cool.

38:59.470 --> 39:01.097
(Sighing)

39:05.640 --> 39:07.529
- Erin?

39:10.610 --> 39:12.647
Erin, I'm, uh...

39:14.420 --> 39:18.414
What happened earlier
wasn't your--wasn't your fault.

39:19.820 --> 39:21.686
I'm not--I'm not angry at you.

39:21.720 --> 39:23.381
(Car honking in distance)

39:24.790 --> 39:27.350
I'm really sorry.

39:32.330 --> 39:34.025
Erin?

39:36.000 --> 39:37.638
Erin?

39:45.750 --> 39:48.276
(Car honking)

39:49.080 --> 39:51.788
Maybe she just
needed some space.

39:51.820 --> 39:54.312
For a night, maybe?

39:55.120 --> 39:56.986
She'll come back.

39:57.020 --> 39:58.954
She'll come back.
We'll give her a night.

39:58.990 --> 40:01.220
We'll call
the cops tomorrow.

40:02.130 --> 40:04.622
= It is kind of
intense, I guess.

40:04.670 --> 40:08.595
I mean, with everything
going on with us right now.

40:08.640 --> 40:12.133
We probably shouldn't
rush into things.

40:12.970 --> 40:14.836
You know?

40:14.880 --> 40:17.531
Taking on someone like Erin,

40:17.580 --> 40:20.345
that would be a lot
for us, right?

40:20.380 --> 40:25.546
Like you said, she's from
a completely different world.

40:26.650 --> 40:29.984
One that maybe we don't
completely understand.

40:30.960 --> 40:34.658
She's got a long way to go,
letting people in.

40:37.100 --> 40:39.592
Plus, we just got
Aidan and Sally back.

40:39.630 --> 40:42.634
She should probably
get used to that

40:42.670 --> 40:47.460
before we do anything
else major, you know?

40:47.510 --> 40:49.274
- Right.

40:52.050 --> 40:53.802
- Besides, between
her and Sally,

40:53.850 --> 40:58.071
I don't know how we'd ever
keep enough cereal in the house.

40:58.890 --> 41:00.949
- And then
there is that.

41:00.990 --> 41:02.185
Hey!

41:04.160 --> 41:06.254
I think we--

41:06.290 --> 41:09.726
I think we could handle more...

41:10.730 --> 41:12.596
eventually.

41:13.530 --> 41:17.194
A lot more,
if you ask me.

41:19.410 --> 41:22.732
- You wanna contact the adoption
agencies in Uganda?

41:24.680 --> 41:26.375
- No.

41:35.720 --> 41:37.859
(Beeping)

41:37.890 --> 41:41.190
- Tends to be pretty quiet here
at night, as you'll see.

41:41.230 --> 41:44.689
Can be unnerving to some
of the other nurses.

41:44.730 --> 41:46.095
- Oh, T'll be fine.

41:46.130 --> 41:49.031
How long, incidentally,
is one stuck on the night shift?

41:49.070 --> 41:52.563
- I don't know. Maybe you don't
disappear for a year

41:52.610 --> 41:54.806
and you'll get off
on good behaviour.

41:54.840 --> 41:55.830
- Who's that?

41:56.840 --> 41:59.070
- Oh, that's Kenny.

41:59.110 --> 42:03.320
He got transferred here from
Providence about 8 months ago.

42:03.350 --> 42:05.580
Poor kid. He's been
stuck in that glass cage

42:05.620 --> 42:07.281
since he was
a toddler.

42:07.320 --> 42:08.549
- Really?
- Yeah.

42:08.590 --> 42:10.809
- Severe combined
immunodeficiency.

42:10.860 --> 42:13.227
- Bubble boy disease.

42:13.260 --> 42:15.592
Don't let him hear
you call it that.

42:15.630 --> 42:18.019
He's very
sensitive about it.

42:18.060 --> 42:19.562
As he should be.

42:19.600 --> 42:22.240
If a single germ gets through
that glass, he could die.

42:22.270 --> 42:25.570
He's never been sick and it's
not gonna happen on our watch.

42:27.240 --> 42:29.038
Makes you grateful,
doesn't it,

42:29.080 --> 42:30.502
for everything
we have.

42:31.510 --> 42:33.239
- Yeah.

42:35.680 --> 42:37.216
Yeah, it does.
