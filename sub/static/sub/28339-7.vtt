Yeah, he just got me
an audition.

03:48.750 --> 03:51.957
-What?
-Yeah, I didn't realize
that's how it worked.

03:52.041 --> 03:54.124
It's kind of neat.

03:54.207 --> 03:56.957
(theme music playing)

03:59.124 --> 04:00.458
So...

04:01.791 --> 04:03.041

04:03.124 --> 04:06.458
No, it's a movie.
So, how did your
thing go?

04:06.541 --> 04:08.666
And, um, you're,

04:08.750 --> 04:11.416
you're going straight in
for... for the director?

04:11.499 --> 04:13.166
Yeah. Some guy
named Jay Roach.

04:13.249 --> 04:14.416
They like me
'cause I'm tall,

04:14.499 --> 04:16.833
and the other guy
they cast is short.

04:16.916 --> 04:18.166
Apparently, it affects
the poster.

04:18.249 --> 04:19.916
The poster?
(chuckles)

04:19.999 --> 04:22.082
Uh, so, so, so,
let me get this straight.

04:22.166 --> 04:24.750
So, so, just because
you're tall,

04:24.833 --> 04:28.916
you skipped like five rounds
of callbacks, at least?

04:28.999 --> 04:30.708
I mean, Michael
is Lindsay's boss.

04:30.791 --> 04:32.416
Michael?

04:32.499 --> 04:33.708
Michael.

04:34.916 --> 04:36.916
-The man you met
in the lobby.
-Oh, right.

04:36.999 --> 04:38.999
Yeah, he gave me
his card. Michael.

04:42.041 --> 04:43.625
(sighs)

04:44.916 --> 04:46.791
-An audition?
-Mm-hmm.

04:46.875 --> 04:47.916
-You?
-Yeah.

04:47.999 --> 04:50.041
-Have an audition?
-Yeah.

04:51.499 --> 04:53.124
What, are they
reading extras now?

04:53.207 --> 04:55.833
No. That is so weird.
Sally said the same thing.

04:55.916 --> 04:58.541
-What's the part?
-It's a guy named, um...

04:59.666 --> 05:02.708
J.T. in a movie called
Swim Instructors.

05:05.082 --> 05:06.541
How many of these
did you print?

05:06.625 --> 05:08.416
It's just one.
It's four scenes.

05:08.499 --> 05:12.207
Holy moly.
J.T. is on every page.

05:12.291 --> 05:13.957
That's a lot
of lines, Barry.

05:14.041 --> 05:15.999
Yeah, I think
he's one of the leads.

05:17.249 --> 05:18.583
(gasps)
No!

05:18.666 --> 05:23.625
You say, "Oh, we're just
a bunch of swim instructors."

05:23.708 --> 05:27.333
That's the title.
They can't cut that!

05:27.416 --> 05:28.999
(doors creaking)

05:29.082 --> 05:31.666
All of you, on your feet!

05:33.374 --> 05:34.957
Now!

05:35.041 --> 05:39.249
If we grab...
Yeah, if you grab me,
and we just...

05:39.333 --> 05:40.458
There we go.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.957

05:46.750 --> 05:49.166
Cristobal? Okay.
Come on, my friend.

05:49.249 --> 05:50.499
Uh... Maybe fresh start?

05:50.583 --> 05:52.458
You know,
one-time do-over?

05:52.541 --> 05:55.541
Mulligan?
Get out of free jail?

05:57.249 --> 05:58.583
Get on.

05:59.916 --> 06:02.916
(plays funeral dirge)

06:02.999 --> 06:04.708
Oh, for fuck's sake.
This fucking guy.

06:04.791 --> 06:06.666
Can someone please
shut him up?

06:06.750 --> 06:08.082
Bolivian:
Get on.

06:09.082 --> 06:11.291
At this point, for me,

06:11.374 --> 06:13.999
the worst reason
to make another TV show

06:14.082 --> 06:15.875
would be to make a TV show.

06:15.957 --> 06:19.166
-You know what I mean?
-I... Uh-huh.

06:19.249 --> 06:21.166
Like, another zero
on my paychecks

06:21.249 --> 06:22.999
-isn't going to change my life.
-(Sally chuckles)

06:23.082 --> 06:26.041
I mean, at this point,
I'm really gravitating

06:26.124 --> 06:28.583
towards smaller,
more interesting,

06:28.666 --> 06:29.957
more relevant material.

06:30.041 --> 06:31.791
Like, I'm interested in
what's going on right now.

06:31.875 --> 06:33.708
Yes. Totally. Me, too.

06:33.791 --> 06:36.333
I mean, I am also gravitating
toward more honest--

06:36.416 --> 06:38.541
Which isn't
what's being made.

06:38.625 --> 06:40.499
I mean, not in
this town, at least.

06:40.583 --> 06:44.708
So, look, it sounds like
we might be a good fit.

06:44.791 --> 06:46.207
Totally.
(chuckles)

06:46.291 --> 06:47.833
Yeah, Team Gersh
told me about your past,

06:47.916 --> 06:49.333
what you're
working on right now.

06:49.416 --> 06:52.374
Sounds really relevant,
really current.

06:52.458 --> 06:54.541
Thank you. I-I really
appreciate that because--

06:54.625 --> 06:57.249
So, the elevator pitch
is basically this:

06:57.333 --> 06:58.957
There's three women.

06:59.041 --> 07:02.041
When we meet them,
they're all in
abusive relationships.

07:02.124 --> 07:04.666
They're lost.
But then over
the course of the pilot,

07:04.750 --> 07:07.541
they meet each other,
they realize how much
they have in common,

07:07.625 --> 07:09.750
and they start to lean
on each other.

07:09.833 --> 07:12.875
-Oh, that's nice.
-And because now there's
this sense of community,

07:12.957 --> 07:15.750
-they become stronger.
-That's great. I love that.

07:15.833 --> 07:17.708
So, they start a group where
they kill their husbands.

07:17.791 --> 07:19.583
-Jesus.
-But that's the pilot.

07:19.666 --> 07:22.583
The series is them
finding other women

07:22.666 --> 07:25.583
in similar tough spots
and helping them get revenge,

07:25.666 --> 07:28.666
whether it's slipping poison
into the dudes' cocktails

07:28.750 --> 07:32.416
or blowing them and the new
girlfriend up on a boat.

07:32.499 --> 07:33.916
It's empowering.

07:33.999 --> 07:36.374
I'm really not supposed
to show you this.

07:41.916 --> 07:43.416
-Payback Ladies?
-Yeah.

07:43.499 --> 07:44.791
-Payback Ladies.
-Payback Ladies.

07:44.875 --> 07:46.666
You'd be this one.

07:47.499 --> 07:50.833
"It's that time
of the month...
for revenge."

07:50.916 --> 07:52.708
Maybe this one.

07:54.791 --> 07:56.124
What do you mean you passed?

07:56.207 --> 07:58.583
You just passed on
an Aaron Ryan show? Why?

07:58.666 --> 08:01.541
It was about three
abused women, um,

08:01.625 --> 08:03.207
who become
murderers, okay?

08:03.291 --> 08:05.916
I mean, he had
a period pun on the poster.
It was offensive.

08:05.999 --> 08:07.750
The show has three leads in it,

08:07.833 --> 08:09.291
and you would be one of them.

08:09.374 --> 08:10.833
Do you not want to be
a lead in a TV show?

08:10.916 --> 08:14.082
-Not that TV show, no.
-(door opens)

08:14.166 --> 08:17.916
Did I just hear this right?
Did you just pass on Aaron Ryan?

08:18.541 --> 08:21.708
Guys, look, I really appreciate
you getting me the meeting.

08:21.791 --> 08:23.833
Really, I do. But I--

08:23.916 --> 08:25.124
I mean, Lindsay,
you saw my piece.

08:25.207 --> 08:26.666
Do you really think
that what he's doing

08:26.750 --> 08:28.541
and what I'm doing
are the same thing?

08:28.625 --> 08:31.124
-Uh...
-Can I be blunt?

08:31.207 --> 08:33.499
You really
don't have the credits
to be turning this down.

08:33.583 --> 08:36.791
-Yeah, we've all seen your reel.
-You cut together my reel.

08:36.875 --> 08:38.666
You can't honestly think
that little theater piece

08:38.750 --> 08:40.499
is a better
career move than this.

08:40.583 --> 08:42.791
Look, I want to work, okay?
I really want to work.

08:42.875 --> 08:45.916
I want to be the lead
on a TV show, obviously.

08:45.999 --> 08:49.124
But I am trying
to do something real,

08:49.207 --> 08:51.499
and that was not it.

08:51.583 --> 08:54.082
That was revenge porn.

08:54.708 --> 08:57.875
Well, let us know how big
the paycheck is on your play.

08:59.833 --> 09:02.291
You know, maybe this
isn't a good fit.

09:05.333 --> 09:06.458
Uh...

09:08.124 --> 09:10.999
Hey, Sally.
Okay, Sally.

09:11.082 --> 09:12.541
All right, Barry.

09:12.625 --> 09:18.249
Somehow, you now
have an audition
for a major feature.

09:18.333 --> 09:21.374
-Movie.
-Same process.

09:21.458 --> 09:23.041
Now, they didn't send
the whole script.

09:23.124 --> 09:24.291
They only sent your scenes.

09:24.374 --> 09:26.374
We're gonna have to do
a little detective work,

09:26.458 --> 09:29.374
and from what I can gather,
here's the journey.

09:29.458 --> 09:32.541
-J.T.--
-J.T.'s one of
the swim instructors.

09:32.625 --> 09:34.957
Yeah, I had a hunch.

09:35.957 --> 09:37.916
He's very upset
in the beginning.

09:37.999 --> 09:41.207
Yeah, 'cause, uh, another
swim instructor, Ike,
stole his girlfriend.

09:41.291 --> 09:42.833
Oh, dear.

09:42.916 --> 09:47.291
So, Ike has forced the horns
of the cuckold upon you,

09:47.374 --> 09:52.499
so your guy seeks revenge by...

09:54.499 --> 09:59.041
shitting in a pie
and trying to get him
to eat it.

09:59.124 --> 10:00.333
Yeah, that's how I read it.

10:00.416 --> 10:04.708
And then by some
cruel twist of irony...

10:06.499 --> 10:08.249
you eat the shit pie.

10:08.333 --> 10:10.416
Yeah, but that's not until
scene three, right?

10:10.499 --> 10:12.833
I'm trying not
to overwhelm you, Barry.

10:12.916 --> 10:15.458
I'm trying to give you
the view from 10,000 feet

10:15.541 --> 10:18.583
before we dive in
and break it down
scene by scene.

10:18.666 --> 10:22.999
-So, scene one, "Loss."
-Mm-hmm.

10:23.082 --> 10:26.791
Scene two,
you shit in a pie.

10:26.875 --> 10:28.875
So, uh, relief?

10:28.957 --> 10:31.875
No. I think it's a little
more nuanced than that.

10:31.957 --> 10:34.082
I think it's
about vengeance.

10:34.166 --> 10:36.416
-Okay.
-And then, scene three,

10:36.499 --> 10:39.791
whoopsie,
you eat the shit pie.

10:39.875 --> 10:41.124
Comeuppance.

10:41.207 --> 10:46.374
He who seeks revenge
digs two graves, Barry.

10:46.458 --> 10:49.291
It's a tale as old as time.

10:49.374 --> 10:51.124
Damn.

10:51.207 --> 10:52.458
And then there's scene four

10:52.541 --> 10:54.166
about the little girl
who's drowning,

10:54.249 --> 10:55.875
but you don't
have to save her.

10:55.957 --> 10:57.333
Yeah, 'cause I taught
her how to swim.

10:57.416 --> 11:02.082
Yeah. And I think you only
have one line, which is...

11:02.166 --> 11:04.041
-"No fucking way."
-"No fucking way."

11:04.124 --> 11:05.916
So, you know what?
Let's save that for later.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.499
Oh, okay.

11:07.583 --> 11:10.750
By the way,
when is your audition?

11:10.833 --> 11:13.750
Uh, it is--
I got it right here.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.499
Tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.
with the casting director,
Allison Jones.

11:17.583 --> 11:20.625
(chuckles)
No. Ms. Jones will show up
when the director's there.

11:20.708 --> 11:22.583
No, it's a director's session.
He's there, too.

11:22.666 --> 11:24.333
His name is Jay Roach.

11:24.416 --> 11:27.249
Whose cock did you have
to suck in a former life?

11:28.750 --> 11:30.166
All right. All right.
All right. Forget it.

11:30.249 --> 11:32.666
I'll be there 9:45
to warm you up.

11:32.750 --> 11:35.499
-Wait. You're gonna
come with me?
-Absolutely.

11:35.583 --> 11:38.541
Every actor who's got a first
audition brings a scene partner.

11:38.625 --> 11:41.291
-Really?
-Since Shakespeare.

11:41.374 --> 11:43.499
Come on.
Let's get down to work.

11:43.583 --> 11:46.957
Scene one. I just want
to hear the words.

11:47.041 --> 11:48.333
I'm dying.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.124
Hey, Ike, you shitbird!

11:50.207 --> 11:52.957
(high-pitched):
You want a little pie?

11:53.041 --> 11:55.333
Mr. Cousineau said
I should, um,

11:55.416 --> 11:56.999
put a little mustard
on "pie" there--

11:57.082 --> 11:59.666
I'm sorry. Can we, um...
Can we stop?

11:59.750 --> 12:01.082
-Sure.
-For a second.

12:01.166 --> 12:03.333
I just-- I feel like I need
to say something, Barry.

12:03.416 --> 12:05.875
-Okay.
-This piece that
I'm doing for class.

12:05.957 --> 12:08.416
It's exactly what
I should be doing.

12:08.499 --> 12:10.082
Yeah, no, and it's great.
What you're doing is--

12:10.166 --> 12:12.833
I'm terrified, okay?
Because my piece is real.

12:12.916 --> 12:14.541
It's not a character. It's me.

12:14.625 --> 12:17.249
Raw, unapologetic truth
with a capital "T."

12:17.333 --> 12:19.708
I mean, all caps, actually.
I'm thinking like a writer now.

12:19.791 --> 12:22.833
I mean, this was stuff that
I couldn't even talk about
without lying.

12:22.916 --> 12:26.499
And here I am, about
to strip naked in front
of a bunch of strangers

12:26.583 --> 12:29.249
and share something that
I am massively ashamed of.

12:29.333 --> 12:32.625
Not literally. I don't
believe in nudity unless
it drives the story forward.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.583
I'm afraid
that they're gonna judge me,

12:34.666 --> 12:36.583
and I'm afraid
that Sam's gonna find out

12:36.666 --> 12:37.916
and do something crazy.

12:37.999 --> 12:40.124
But I have to do this.

12:40.207 --> 12:42.166
It's-- it's my story to tell.

12:42.249 --> 12:44.875
But then, I mean,
so many other women
have the same story.

12:44.957 --> 12:46.416
What, am I a spokesperson
for them now?

12:46.499 --> 12:47.916
Could I be the face
of a movement?

12:47.999 --> 12:49.374
I mean, what if I get it wrong?

12:49.458 --> 12:51.249
I mean, I resent the fact
that Nick can get up there

12:51.333 --> 12:52.791
and talk about his
"stomach condition,"

12:52.875 --> 12:54.875
and it's not like he has to be
the poster boy for bulimia.

12:54.957 --> 12:57.207
But I get up there,
and whatever I say,
it's like,

12:57.291 --> 12:58.916
"What are we saying
about women?"

12:58.999 --> 13:01.082
I mean, this is just my story!

13:01.166 --> 13:02.750
"But what if you
get it wrong, Sally?"

13:02.833 --> 13:04.541
"I don't know."
"You can't get it wrong, Sally.

13:04.625 --> 13:06.708
But you can't not
tell it either, Sally,
because it's who you are."

13:06.791 --> 13:10.082
Which makes this thing that
my agents sent me on today
so fucking insulting.

13:10.166 --> 13:11.916
Payback Ladies?

13:11.999 --> 13:14.416
It's just another
shit male idea of
what strong women are.

13:14.499 --> 13:16.583
Oh, oh, oh, grab a gun
and some stilettos

13:16.666 --> 13:18.041
and get a goddamn blowout.

13:18.124 --> 13:20.207
"And look how strong
you are now, Sally!"

13:20.291 --> 13:22.791
It's bullshit!
Which, by the way, so is this.

13:22.875 --> 13:24.583
It's quite possibly
the worst thing I've ever read.

13:24.666 --> 13:26.124
But you want to know
the worst part?

13:26.207 --> 13:28.875
You want to know what's really
driving me fucking crazy?

13:28.957 --> 13:33.082
I am so jealous that
you're reading for this.

13:33.166 --> 13:36.291
I have never had
a director's session
for a feature,

13:36.374 --> 13:38.207
which is the same thing
as a movie, P.S.

13:38.291 --> 13:40.916
And I have been doing
this for way longer,

13:40.999 --> 13:45.625
and I think you'd agree
that I am way better.

13:45.708 --> 13:48.957
I... made you!

13:49.041 --> 13:50.999
And I'm actually
represented by Gersh.

13:51.082 --> 13:52.957
Well, at least I was.
I don't even know if
they'd rep me anymore

13:53.041 --> 13:54.999
after what I said
in there today, but still
at least I held my ground,

13:55.082 --> 13:58.750
because I am an artist,
okay, an artist,
and this is not fucking art.

13:58.833 --> 14:02.416
But then, I mean,
to be honest, of course
I'm so happy for you.

14:02.499 --> 14:04.333
I mean, of course I want
you to get this part,
