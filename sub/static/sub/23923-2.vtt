00:05.639 --> 00:07.939
Here you go.
Uh, utensils and napkins
are in the bag.

00:07.974 --> 00:09.174
Thank you.

for you, Mr. Bird.

00:16.149 --> 00:17.916
Mr. Bird?

00:17.951 --> 00:21.787
That's not your name?
It's something Bird, right?

00:21.822 --> 00:23.588
Hold up, where the (BLEEP)
is my food?

00:23.623 --> 00:25.457
Did they forget
my three-meat plate?

00:25.492 --> 00:27.793
I can't not have
my three-meat plate.

00:27.828 --> 00:29.995
It's a special.
They don't always have it.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.064
And you don't know
what the three meats are.

00:32.099 --> 00:33.432
And that's what
makes it great.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.801
What if today was chicken,
beef and penguin?

00:35.836 --> 00:37.669
Or penguin, beef and caribou?

00:37.704 --> 00:40.939
Or just beef, caribou,
penguin, and one more?

00:40.974 --> 00:43.842
And now I'll never know
because they forgot
my three-meat plate.

00:43.877 --> 00:46.745
Well, run outside.
Maybe you can still
catch the guy.

00:46.780 --> 00:49.281

but it's okay.
I'll just have cereal.

01:15.642 --> 01:18.643
Hey, hey, hey, everybody!
You got a new mystery.

01:18.678 --> 01:20.645
Oh, damn.
You ordered from Ted's Grill!

01:20.680 --> 01:23.181
Did you guys get my usual,
the five-fish platter?

01:23.216 --> 01:25.584
We did not
order anything for you,

01:25.619 --> 01:27.519
because no one
thought about you.

01:27.554 --> 01:29.521
Now, give me that mystery.

01:29.556 --> 01:32.190
"Dear Mike Tyson Mystery team,

01:32.225 --> 01:34.092
"I am seven-and-a-half
years old.

01:34.127 --> 01:37.863
"I made a wish on an eyelash
and it didn't come true." Ha!

01:37.898 --> 01:40.465
"Please help, Margaret Moses."

01:40.500 --> 01:43.301
Huh. Go (BLEEP) yourself,
Margaret Moses.

01:43.336 --> 01:46.471
Who's Margaret Moses,
and why is she gonna
(BLEEP) herself?

01:46.506 --> 01:48.540
They forgot the pineapple!

01:48.575 --> 01:52.144
That's what makes
it a (BLEEP) Hawaiian burger!

01:52.179 --> 01:53.912
No, she's a sweet little girl

01:53.947 --> 01:56.281
who thinks if you make
a wish on an eyelash,
it'll come true.

01:56.316 --> 01:59.084
She's right. It works for me
every single time.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.285
That's how come
all of you are here.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.987
-What?
-Yeah. One day I had

02:02.022 --> 02:04.656
an eyelash come out
and I wished for
an Asian baby.

02:04.691 --> 02:06.758
Next day,
Yung was on my doorstep.

02:06.793 --> 02:10.362
Then another eyelash
came out and I wished for
a live-in maid.

02:10.397 --> 02:13.431
And the next day,
poof, I got Marquess.

02:13.466 --> 02:16.034
A few weeks later,
another eyelash came out,

02:16.069 --> 02:19.070
I wished to meet my favorite
Looney Tunes character,

02:19.105 --> 02:21.640
Tweety bird,
and here is Tweety bird.

02:21.675 --> 02:24.676
Oh, I knew it was
something-bird,
it's Tweety bird.

02:24.711 --> 02:27.613
Now, let's go help
little Margaret Moses
get her wish.

02:28.381 --> 02:30.282
(FLIES BUZZING)

02:30.317 --> 02:32.551
Ugh. I bet
poor little Margaret's wish

02:32.586 --> 02:34.319
was get the hell out of
this shithole...

02:34.354 --> 02:37.222
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Oh! Hi.

02:37.257 --> 02:40.959
Oh, we were just
admiring your home!

02:40.994 --> 02:42.727
Yeah! Oh, this home is...

02:42.762 --> 02:45.330
Oh, it's...
Oh, it's so, it's...

02:45.365 --> 02:48.867
Well, it's you know,
it is, um, well,
it's just absolute...

02:48.902 --> 02:50.769
All these wires,

02:50.804 --> 02:52.337
and the trash,

02:52.372 --> 02:55.273
the tires, oh. Mmm-hmm.

02:55.308 --> 02:56.808
Yeah, this is so...

02:56.843 --> 02:58.944
Ugh. Quit wasting
everyone's time, Margaret.

02:58.979 --> 03:01.179
-Tell them
what you wished for.
-I can't.

03:01.214 --> 03:03.682
You told me
if you say your wish,
it won't come true.

03:03.717 --> 03:06.117
I probably just you told that
to shut you up!

03:06.152 --> 03:08.954
Look, if wishes came true,
you think I'd be living
in this hellhole?

03:08.989 --> 03:11.456
You know how many times
I wished I was a singer,

03:11.491 --> 03:13.625
and everyone knew my songs,
and knew who I was,

03:13.660 --> 03:14.993
and that I mattered
in this world?

03:15.028 --> 03:17.896
Uh-oh. You just said
your wish out loud.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.931
Now your wish
will never come true.

03:19.966 --> 03:22.834
You'll be stuck here forever
doing whatever job
is your job.

03:24.938 --> 03:26.705
Oh. Uh...

03:26.740 --> 03:29.541
It's fine, come on in.
You can head on back
to the bedroom.

03:29.576 --> 03:30.842
I'll be there in a second.

03:36.149 --> 03:38.984
(SNIFFLES) If you'll
excuse me, I have a client.

03:39.019 --> 03:42.354
Margaret, there's
chicken nuggets in the freezer
if you're hungry.

03:45.292 --> 03:47.525
Oh, the mom
is a trailer park whore.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.127
That old situation.

03:49.162 --> 03:52.297
Pigeon! Don't worry, Margaret.
It's all gonna be okay.

03:52.332 --> 03:56.134
I promise you,
we will make sure
your wish comes true.

03:56.169 --> 03:58.303
Marquess, don't
promise her that.

03:58.338 --> 03:59.938
We don't even know
what she wished for.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.273
We don't need to know.

04:01.308 --> 04:03.141
We just need to go
to the Wishing Well.

04:03.176 --> 04:05.110
-The Wishing Well?
-Yes.

04:05.145 --> 04:07.012
The Wishing Well
in Fantasy Forest.

04:07.047 --> 04:10.582
It's hard to find
because it's hidden
by the Bountiful Bush.

04:10.617 --> 04:13.084
-Hey, those are for me!
-Oh, really?

04:13.119 --> 04:15.754
Is that why it says
Tyson chicken nuggets?

04:15.789 --> 04:19.557
If it said Margaret Moses
chicken nuggets,
I wouldn't be eating them.

04:19.592 --> 04:23.262
But I probably would
because all I had today
was a bowl of cereal.

04:28.535 --> 04:30.769
-Marquess, slow down!
-I can't.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.971
The only way
to get to Fantasy Forest is

04:33.006 --> 04:36.308
to be going 100 miles an hour
on a lonely highway

04:36.343 --> 04:38.377
when the clock
strikes midnight.

04:43.717 --> 04:44.716
(GASPS)

04:49.823 --> 04:52.490
That's not possible!
It's midnight.

04:52.525 --> 04:54.359
We were going
100 miles an hour

04:54.394 --> 04:56.261
on a lonely highway
at midnight.

04:56.296 --> 04:59.431
Oh, no. That clock is wrong.
It's still on
daylight savings time.

04:59.466 --> 05:00.799
I just don't know
how to change it.

05:00.834 --> 05:03.501
-So, it's 11:00?
-It's probably around 10:40,

05:03.536 --> 05:06.204
10:43, 10:50, something,

05:06.239 --> 05:09.007
because the very first time
I was setting it, I was like,

05:09.042 --> 05:10.875
"Yung, what's the exact time
right now?"

05:10.910 --> 05:14.346
And she was like, "2:38."
Then I started setting it.

05:14.381 --> 05:16.414
You had to press
that button so many times.

05:16.449 --> 05:17.882
Then I finally get to 2:38,

05:17.917 --> 05:20.085
but I'm on a.m.
and I'm trying to get on p.m.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.587
So, by the time
I got the right 2:38 on there,

05:22.622 --> 05:24.556
it was around 2:50
or some shit.

05:24.591 --> 05:27.859
(YAWNS) I'm gonna
take a nap for a bit.

05:27.894 --> 05:31.029
I ate too many
of the delicious
Tyson chicken nuggets.

05:33.266 --> 05:36.935
(SIGHS) Well, looks like
we have some time to kill.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.236
Anyone have any ideas?

05:38.271 --> 05:40.572
-BOTH: Well, why don't you...
-Oh. (CHUCKLES)

05:40.607 --> 05:41.973
No, I'm sorry.
What were you going to say?

05:42.008 --> 05:44.776
-No, no. I'm sorry. You go.
-No, please.

05:44.811 --> 05:47.645
I was gonna say,
"Why don't you tell us
about the Wishing Well?"

05:47.680 --> 05:50.315
Interesting, how different
people are.

05:50.350 --> 05:54.085
I was gonna say,
"Why don't you drive back
to that trailer park,

05:54.120 --> 05:55.453
"so I can (BLEEP) that whore?"

05:55.488 --> 05:57.222
-(YUNG SIGHS)
-But, fair is fair.

05:57.257 --> 05:58.590
I said you go first.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.558
So, let's hear about
this Wishing Well.

06:00.593 --> 06:03.395
Okay. They tell you
when you first die.
Not the first thing,

06:03.430 --> 06:06.131
but after you've been there
for a little bit.
You know, like a day.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.900
They send you
to this seminar. It's called
"Secrets of the universe."

06:08.935 --> 06:11.069
It sounds more exciting
than it is, believe me.

06:11.104 --> 06:13.772
And you can't have any food
or drink in there,
unless it's water.

06:13.807 --> 06:17.675
And it's like, "(BLEEP) me!
I just died.
I want a (BLEEP) Diet Coke."

06:17.710 --> 06:20.378
Ugh, anyway. You learn
about time, you know.

06:20.413 --> 06:22.814
It goes backwards
and forwards, and this way
and that way.

06:22.849 --> 06:24.749
And you're like, "Really?
Because right now,

06:24.784 --> 06:27.352
"it doesn't feel like
it's moving at all,
because I have to piss,

06:27.387 --> 06:29.821
"because all I've been doing
is drinking (BLEEP)
water." (CHUCKLES)

06:29.856 --> 06:33.291
Anyway, God is
just up there, yabbering,

06:33.326 --> 06:36.161
and, oh, my God, he loves
the sound of his voice.

06:36.196 --> 06:37.629
And yes, God is a man.

06:37.664 --> 06:39.197
I'm sorry,
what about the Wishing Well?

06:39.232 --> 06:40.799
Hmm? Oh, yeah. Right, okay.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.201
So, all wishes
are sent to the Wishing Well,

06:43.236 --> 06:46.171
but, you must remember
that not all wishes
should be granted.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.807
Some people wish
for some terrible things,

06:48.842 --> 06:50.008
you know,
to happen to other people.

06:50.043 --> 06:52.243
Oh, yeah.
I do that all the time.

06:52.278 --> 06:56.514
Like, right now,
I'm wishing that car
coming the opposite way

06:56.549 --> 06:59.984
would swerve in our lane,
and kill the driver.

07:00.019 --> 07:01.986
Oh, my God! You don't even
know that person.

07:02.021 --> 07:03.855
No, I'm talking about
the driver in this car.

07:03.890 --> 07:07.592
(BLEEP) you. Okay.
So, the bad wishes get caught

07:07.627 --> 07:09.394
in the branches
of the Bountiful Bush.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.931
So, you think Margaret
wished for something
bad to happen

07:12.966 --> 07:14.599
and that's why
it didn't come true?

07:14.634 --> 07:16.134
Okay, no. Unfortunately,

07:16.169 --> 07:18.369
even some good wishes
get caught in the Bush,

07:18.404 --> 07:21.339
which is why it needs to be
trimmed occasionally.

07:21.374 --> 07:22.540
You know, groomed.

07:22.575 --> 07:24.676
Okay. What time is it now?

07:24.711 --> 07:27.612
Ugh. Your father
set this clock
completely wrong.

07:27.647 --> 07:29.481
It's only 9:42.

07:29.516 --> 07:31.149
Well, let's just
pull over and wait.

07:31.184 --> 07:33.885
PIGEON: We're still not gonna
go back to the trailer park?

07:33.920 --> 07:35.987
You get me
all hot and bothered

07:36.022 --> 07:38.423
with all this
bush-trimming talk,

07:38.458 --> 07:41.893
and now you want to
just sit by the side
of the road?

07:41.928 --> 07:44.629
What am I supposed to do
with this massive erection?

07:44.664 --> 07:45.897
I don't see anything.

07:45.932 --> 07:48.533
That's because
it's inside my body,

07:48.568 --> 07:49.934
because I'm a bird.

07:49.969 --> 07:52.437
I don't see your tits.
What's your excuse?

07:52.472 --> 07:55.507
Oh, that's right.
You've got the body
of an 11-year-old boy.

07:55.542 --> 07:58.643
Well, (BLEEP) you,
you-don't-see-anything!

07:58.678 --> 07:59.911
Let's just rest.

"so we could be
a family again."

Aw. Okay. So, how do we get it
into the Wishing Well?

09:47.553 --> 09:49.120
