00:06.174 --> 00:08.916
So they claim this new
cat litter is better,

00:08.918 --> 00:12.345
so I thought I'd do a
little blind pee test.

00:12.347 --> 00:14.514
And they were right.

00:14.516 --> 00:18.351
But I thought, you know,
the next time I do this test,

00:18.353 --> 00:20.603
I'm gonna use the cat's urine.

00:24.529 --> 00:26.704
You know, speaking of
urine, you're an idiot.

00:28.920 --> 00:31.509
Chuck, I'll tell you, your team
did a great job on the interior.

00:31.511 --> 00:32.889
- It looks great.
- Thanks, man.

00:32.891 --> 00:35.224
I don't want to toot my own horn, but...

00:35.226 --> 00:36.902
Pretty sweet.

00:36.904 --> 00:40.706
You know, my girlfriend drove a
Plymouth Barracuda back in 1970.

00:40.708 --> 00:43.426
That's weird. How can a woman
have such great taste in cars

00:43.428 --> 00:45.027
and such lousy taste in men?

00:45.029 --> 00:48.217
Burn!

00:48.219 --> 00:50.433
Gee, I wonder what Vanessa drives.

00:50.435 --> 00:52.601
Ooh! Return burn.

00:52.603 --> 00:54.369
What, are you keeping score?

00:54.371 --> 00:56.230
Quit being Switzerland. Pick a side.

00:57.487 --> 00:58.926
Oh, these zingers are good.

00:58.928 --> 01:00.407
I got to remember to tell some of these

01:00.409 --> 01:02.711
to my mom when she's sober.

01:02.713 --> 01:05.212
- How's it going, gentlemen?
- Looking good.

01:05.215 --> 01:06.899
One or two more days,
I think she's done.

01:06.901 --> 01:09.653
Beautiful, beautiful. I
mean, it looks magnificent.

01:09.655 --> 01:11.503
- Mm-hmm.
- Makes me feel like I'm back in the '70s.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.314
- Yeah?
- All that's missing is my Afro.

01:15.184 --> 01:18.560
Is it really an Afro if
it's on a Spanish guy?

01:18.562 --> 01:21.897
Oh. All right, I have
very exciting news.

01:21.899 --> 01:23.991
I have our next restoration.

01:23.993 --> 01:26.943
Ooh, please, '68 Charger, '68 Charger.

01:26.945 --> 01:29.112
I'll take any early-'60s muscle car.

01:29.114 --> 01:31.239
- Mm-hmm. It's better than that.
- All right.

01:31.241 --> 01:35.410
It's a 1970 Plymouth Barracuda.

01:35.412 --> 01:38.121
This exact car again?

01:38.123 --> 01:39.835
That's three Barracuda in a row.

01:39.837 --> 01:41.958
That's strange even in the ocean.

01:41.960 --> 01:43.460
Okay, hold on, hold on. Hold on.

01:43.462 --> 01:46.105
It's a different color, all right? Okay.

01:46.107 --> 01:48.632
Uh, it's the same color.

01:48.634 --> 01:51.241
This is probably weird coming out of me,

01:51.243 --> 01:53.927
but I'm worried about
our lack of diversity.

02:02.375 --> 02:04.449
Come on, man, I want to
do something different.

02:04.451 --> 02:05.982
Enough with the Barracudas.

02:05.984 --> 02:09.173
I agree. But the preferred
plural of Barracuda

02:09.175 --> 02:12.423
is Barracuda, not Barracudas.

02:14.377 --> 02:16.660
Do you actually know that?

02:16.662 --> 02:18.804
And yet, ten minutes ago, you asked me

02:18.806 --> 02:20.514
how many inches were in a quart.

02:21.809 --> 02:25.157
So, what is it with all the Barracuda?

02:25.159 --> 02:28.458
Our last client is a member
of the Barracuda Owners Club.

02:28.460 --> 02:30.214
Now, everybody loved what
you did, so naturally,

02:30.216 --> 02:32.162
they want theirs restored, too.

02:32.164 --> 02:34.228
Yeah, but it's the same car.

02:34.230 --> 02:37.305
I want to do something
different. I want a challenge.

02:37.307 --> 02:39.158
- You want a challenge?
- Yeah.

02:39.160 --> 02:41.577
How about refilling the
coffee pot after you're done?

02:43.355 --> 02:45.455
You know, maybe if our
company is more well known,

02:45.457 --> 02:48.000
we could be more picky
about our choices.

02:48.002 --> 02:49.626
One of my best friends
owns Motor Masters.

02:49.628 --> 02:50.832
He said he'll do an article on us,

02:50.834 --> 02:52.913
but I thought you guys
wanted to keep this a hobby.

02:52.915 --> 02:57.009
Yeah, we did, but, uh, maybe
it's time we kick it up a notch.

02:57.011 --> 03:00.012
Uh, yeah, yeah, like, you know,
I have my two tabby cats.

03:00.014 --> 03:04.458
And I was happy, but
then... then I wanted more.

03:04.460 --> 03:07.594
And I said, "Joe, you deserve it".

03:07.596 --> 03:11.598
So I got myself a hairless Egyptian.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.001
Mother of God, I hope that's a cat.

03:16.680 --> 03:20.015
We're one phone call away from
getting all over the Internet.

03:20.017 --> 03:22.125
Yeah, but you'll make
it all about yourself.

03:22.127 --> 03:23.135
You know, hey,

03:23.137 --> 03:25.314
"Mike Baxter here for car restoration,

03:25.316 --> 03:27.689
talking about how to steal credit".

03:27.691 --> 03:30.629
Hey, Gladys, I don't want
to be one of your Pips, okay?

03:30.631 --> 03:32.676
All right, we'll just wait for a call

03:32.678 --> 03:35.214
from somebody who
admires one of you guys.

03:35.216 --> 03:37.199
Oh, wait a minute.

03:37.201 --> 03:38.533
Okay, now,

03:38.535 --> 03:40.004
that's not fair.

03:40.006 --> 03:42.200
Mike Baxter has always
been very generous

03:42.202 --> 03:43.442
about sharing the spotlight.

03:43.444 --> 03:46.112
Oh, yeah? When the Denver
Stand wanted to do a story

03:46.114 --> 03:47.838
about Outdoor Man, they called Baxter

03:47.840 --> 03:50.563
"the heart, soul and
face of the company".

03:50.565 --> 03:52.547
That does not bother me at all.

03:53.960 --> 03:57.478
You do hog the limelight,
you greedy son of a bitch.

03:57.480 --> 04:00.629
Okay, what if there was
a way I could promise

04:00.631 --> 04:02.502
to subdue my natural charisma

04:02.504 --> 04:05.393
so the article wouldn't
be just about me? Deal?

04:05.395 --> 04:07.136
- Yeah.
- Well, that's okay, I guess.

04:07.138 --> 04:08.581
- Yeah?
- All right.

04:08.583 --> 04:14.211
And then, all of us try to
visualize this man in a 'fro.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.834
How'd I do on the test? Great, I bet.

04:19.837 --> 04:22.211
I always do well on
tests. Tell me, tell me.

04:22.213 --> 04:25.865
No, Jen, it's not a test.
It's a psychological profile

04:25.867 --> 04:28.656
on how people perceive the
world and make decisions.

04:28.658 --> 04:29.751
There's no right or wrong.

04:29.753 --> 04:32.012
- Okay, Mrs. B.
- Yeah, what? What?

04:32.014 --> 04:35.090
- What?
- You are open and kind.

04:35.092 --> 04:36.442
Ah...

04:37.928 --> 04:40.521
I knew it! Yeah!

04:40.523 --> 04:43.657
You follow that, Princess Perfect.

04:45.936 --> 04:47.528
Wow.

04:47.530 --> 04:52.107
Open, kind and really bad at trash talk.

04:52.109 --> 04:55.485
Okay, Jen, your answers
suggest you are extroverted

04:55.487 --> 04:57.704
and a great thinker.

04:57.706 --> 05:02.376
Okay. Seems odd they're
ignoring my artistic nature.

05:02.378 --> 05:05.161
Ooh, okay, do mine. Unless it's bad.

05:05.163 --> 05:07.289
Nod your head if it's bad.

05:07.291 --> 05:10.050
Okay, uh, Mandy, you...

05:10.052 --> 05:13.003
skipped a lot of questions.

05:13.005 --> 05:16.464
Well, I mean, it worked
on my driver's test.

05:16.466 --> 05:18.535
Oh, you know what? It worked here, too,

05:18.537 --> 05:22.108
'cause it also says you're
super cute and a love bunny.

05:22.110 --> 05:23.397
It does?

05:23.399 --> 05:25.307
- Hey, Mrs. B. Mwah.
- Hey. Hi. Hey.

05:25.309 --> 05:26.975
I brought back your casserole dish.

05:26.977 --> 05:29.519
The pregnant wife said,
uh, "Keep 'em coming".

05:29.521 --> 05:31.905
- Okay.
- What's up, gang?

05:31.907 --> 05:34.524
We're doing a psych
questionnaire for Kyle's class.

05:34.526 --> 05:36.690
Oh, a psych test? All
right, bring it on.

05:36.692 --> 05:38.194
Yeah, give it him. Give it to him.

05:38.196 --> 05:40.155
And just so you know,
the high score so far

05:40.157 --> 05:44.176
is "open and kind".

05:44.178 --> 05:45.617
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah.

05:45.619 --> 05:47.162
All right, agree or disagree?

05:47.164 --> 05:49.940
"Others would describe me
as easygoing and flexible".

05:49.942 --> 05:51.684
Easy. Obviously. Next.

05:53.245 --> 05:56.597
Okay, uh, "I seek feedback
from others, even if negative".

05:56.599 --> 05:58.774
Big agree. Best way to learn.

06:01.553 --> 06:03.103
What?

06:03.105 --> 06:05.281
Are you hearing all the words?

06:07.392 --> 06:09.706
Uh, yeah. Keep going.

06:09.708 --> 06:12.089
Uh, o-okay. Uh, "I get upset

06:12.091 --> 06:13.373
when things don't go as planned".

06:13.375 --> 06:15.482
Disagree.

06:15.484 --> 06:17.284
Ry-Ry rolls with the punches.

06:17.286 --> 06:19.569
Wow.

06:19.571 --> 06:22.289
Uh, okay, what's the problem?

06:22.291 --> 06:25.885
Uh, it's just, I-I mean,
does this sound like you?

06:25.887 --> 06:29.037
Yeah, you are making
yourself seem awfully chill.

06:29.039 --> 06:32.355
Uh, I am chill, okay? I'm also
too busy to be put on trial,

06:32.357 --> 06:33.800
so I'm going to work.

06:33.802 --> 06:36.419
You know what, maybe I'll be
on time, and maybe I'll be late.

06:36.421 --> 06:37.730
Either way, it's all good.

06:43.571 --> 06:46.668
- Okay, the article's up.
- Oh, oh, really? Oh, man.

06:46.670 --> 06:48.765
- Yeah.
- Already? You really are a marketing genius.

06:48.767 --> 06:51.058
Yeah, I think it's time
we retire that word,

06:51.060 --> 06:53.487
move on to "icon" or "legend".

06:53.489 --> 06:55.414
Oh, look at that!

06:55.416 --> 06:58.251
I'm on the homepage of Motor Masters.

06:58.253 --> 06:59.401
Yeah.

06:59.403 --> 07:01.587
Who's the loser now, Jarrod Murray?

07:01.589 --> 07:04.297
Yeah. Who is Jarrod Murray?

07:04.299 --> 07:06.363
Eh, he was my fifth-grade bully.

07:06.365 --> 07:10.837
Also, sixth and seventh,
and most of high school.

07:10.839 --> 07:13.997
Oh, oh, oh. "Immaculate dashboard work

07:13.999 --> 07:17.585
- done by Chuck Larabee, Interior Man".
- Yeah.

07:17.587 --> 07:20.588
Interior Man!

07:20.590 --> 07:24.109
- Man, that sounds like a superhero or something.
- Yeah.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.186
Pretty crappy article, huh?

07:26.188 --> 07:27.970
- What?
- What are you talking about?

07:27.972 --> 07:29.235
Did you read it? We came off great.

07:29.237 --> 07:30.449
Yeah, you guys did.

07:30.451 --> 07:32.359
See how many mentions each of us got?

07:32.361 --> 07:35.032
Chuck Larabee, 18. Mike Baxter, 15.

07:35.034 --> 07:36.530
Joe Leonard, two.

07:36.532 --> 07:39.166
Oh, I'm sorry, one. Joe
"Leopard" got the other one.

07:41.203 --> 07:43.111
Man, come on, Joe, we're a team, man.

07:43.113 --> 07:45.321
Oh, are we, Interior Man?

07:45.323 --> 07:47.282
Hey, you got your own nickname.

07:47.284 --> 07:49.826
Joe Leopard.

07:49.828 --> 07:52.023
Oh, I know how this went
down. Baxter told the reporter

07:52.025 --> 07:53.185
about his little buddy Chuck.

07:53.187 --> 07:54.526
And me, I'm just an afterthought.

07:54.528 --> 07:56.322
I'm sick of getting burned, okay?

07:56.324 --> 07:58.719
If anybody cares, I'll
be down in the garage,

07:58.721 --> 08:01.855
underground and underappreciated.

08:04.887 --> 08:07.169
I don't think he read
it. He'd be really upset.

08:07.171 --> 08:09.213
Actually, it says "Joe Leper".

08:17.164 --> 08:19.458
Hey, Joe, hand me my
beer, would you, man?

08:19.460 --> 08:21.643
Yeah, sure, Chuck. Whatever
you need. Here you go.

08:21.645 --> 08:23.985
Hey, how about you,
Baxter? Need a shoeshine?

08:23.987 --> 08:27.070
'Cause I'm just "Two Mention
Joe" at your service.

08:27.072 --> 08:29.354
Come on, Joe, we're all equals here.

08:29.356 --> 08:32.327
I just happen to have
1,000 followers now.

08:32.328 --> 08:36.097
And my dry cleaner put up
a picture of Interior Man.

08:37.832 --> 08:40.831
And I'm on that big Outdoor
Man billboard on I-70, you know?

08:40.832 --> 08:42.270
A lot of people are
having fender benders

08:42.272 --> 08:45.432
looking at my image...
it's almost humbling.

08:45.434 --> 08:48.694
So, yeah, I guess, you
know, we're not all equals.

08:48.696 --> 08:50.848
No, this is unbelievable.
I feel like Howie

08:50.850 --> 08:53.292
from the Backstreet Boys.

08:53.294 --> 08:54.366
Who?

08:54.368 --> 08:56.392
Exactly.

08:56.394 --> 08:58.704
Okay, gather round, children.

08:58.706 --> 09:00.706
Papa Ed is here.

09:00.708 --> 09:02.690
Even he's got a nickname.

09:02.692 --> 09:05.026
A nickname that no one
will ever use, okay?

09:05.028 --> 09:08.071
- What do you got for us?
- Okay. Good news.

09:08.073 --> 09:09.388
- The article worked.
- All right. Excellent.

09:09.390 --> 09:10.801
Okay, we got two cars looking to get in.

09:10.803 --> 09:12.885
We got a... got a '64 GTO, all right?

09:12.887 --> 09:15.796
And we have a '65...
oh, Corvette Stingray.

09:15.798 --> 09:18.590
I love Corvette Stingrays.
I-I say let's do that one.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.583
Hang on. I vote the GTO.

09:20.585 --> 09:22.544
Well, wait a minute.

09:22.546 --> 09:26.022
I like them both, but the
GTO will piss you off, right?

09:26.024 --> 09:27.201
So I'm going with that.

09:27.203 --> 09:28.567
Yes.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.644
Got it? I'll go set it up.

09:30.646 --> 09:33.572
Papa Ed out.

09:33.574 --> 09:36.224
Is this what this has come to?
This used to be a democracy.

09:36.226 --> 09:38.318
Now it's a you-guys-ocracy.

09:38.320 --> 09:40.405
No, two guys out of three voted for it.

09:40.407 --> 09:41.613
That is a democracy.

09:41.615 --> 09:43.064
Not in my America.

09:43.066 --> 09:45.092
Hey, hey. Come on, come on, Joe.

09:45.094 --> 09:46.658
- We'll-we'll do the Stingray next.
- No, no.

09:46.660 --> 09:47.944
No, I don't need your pity.

09:47.946 --> 09:49.713
Oh, I can get that on my own.

09:51.613 --> 09:53.168
Damn. He seemed pretty upset.

09:53.170 --> 09:54.523
I don't think he's coming back.

09:54.525 --> 09:56.336
Yeah? How do you know that?

09:56.338 --> 09:57.721
He took his doughnut.

10:03.512 --> 10:05.104
- Three words.
- Uh, yeah. Uh...

10:05.106 --> 10:07.130
It's a movie.

10:08.425 --> 10:09.591
- A Dog's Life!
- Yeah!

10:09.593 --> 10:11.092
No, no, no! Hey, no!

10:11.094 --> 10:13.803
No, you can't talk in charades.

10:13.805 --> 10:16.281
Uh, that was a bark.

10:18.101 --> 10:19.359
Dogs can't talk.

10:21.016 --> 10:25.940
Ooh, you guys are catching
up. Now it's 35 to one.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.759
- Hello, guys.
- Oh, hey.

10:29.761 --> 10:31.654
- Hey.
- Wow. What a nice surprise.

10:31.656 --> 10:33.552
Wait, so you didn't know I was coming?

10:33.554 --> 10:36.492
Does that mean that
there's no casserole?

10:36.494 --> 10:38.971
You guys all know my wife Kristin.

10:38.973 --> 10:42.498
Uh, yes, we have met.

10:42.500 --> 10:45.960
Kristin probably knows me
better than anyone in the world.

10:45.962 --> 10:48.722
Is this about that test?

10:48.724 --> 10:50.816
There's definitely no casserole.

10:50.818 --> 10:53.691
Okay... babe, when you
came home the other night

10:53.693 --> 10:55.828
and you told me that
there was a dent on my car,

10:55.830 --> 10:57.347
what did I say?

10:57.349 --> 11:00.642
I don't know, you said,
uh, "We'll get it fixed".

11:00.644 --> 11:02.578
We'll get it fixed!

11:03.831 --> 11:07.240
Huh. Pretty darn chill.

11:09.077 --> 11:11.044
Ooh, that's my laundry.
I'll be right back.

11:11.046 --> 11:13.490
Although I am loving this.

11:13.492 --> 11:16.223
Uh, Ryan, we weren't
trying to hurt your feelings

11:16.225 --> 11:18.710
- the other night.
- No, no, no, no, no, no. I know. I, uh...

11:18.712 --> 11:20.512
I just think of myself as easygoing.

11:20.514 --> 11:22.806
And I need you to think
of me that way, too.

11:24.518 --> 11:28.061
And I need you to think of
me as a tall Swedish woman.

11:32.364 --> 11:33.905
Not gonna happen.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.112
Yeah, dude, we're all good.

11:38.181 --> 11:39.773
All right. Thank you.

11:39.775 --> 11:42.231
Okay, well, we'll be going.

11:42.233 --> 11:43.447
Just pretend we weren't here.

11:43.449 --> 11:46.371
- We're getting a casserole on the way home.
- Okay.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.169
Oh, honey, I am so sorry.

11:48.171 --> 11:50.542
I think I ruined your
Toxic Titans T-shirt.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.568
Oh, no.

11:52.570 --> 11:53.861
It's just a shirt.

11:53.863 --> 11:55.464
It's Ryan's.

11:57.075 --> 11:59.551
Oh, no!

11:59.553 --> 12:02.495
That's my shirt?

12:02.497 --> 12:04.723
Oh, my God, this is a collector's item!

12:04.725 --> 12:06.767
Oh, I'm gonna throw up.

12:09.137 --> 12:11.379
Oh, is-is he gonna be all right?

12:11.381 --> 12:14.816
Yeah, yeah, he'll be
fine. He's super chill.

12:19.597 --> 12:21.468
Oh, you hear that?

12:21.470 --> 12:23.085
I don't hear anything.

12:23.087 --> 12:25.059
That's right. You know
what you don't hear?

12:25.061 --> 12:27.484
Joe yapping about how little hair

12:27.486 --> 12:29.605
his Egyptian has on it.

12:29.607 --> 12:32.874
Yeah. And, uh, there's plenty
of doughnuts to go around,

12:32.876 --> 12:36.162
and none of them have been pre-licked.

12:36.164 --> 12:38.799
Yeah, this is great. Yeah.

12:39.951 --> 12:41.909
Man, I can't thread this plug.

12:41.911 --> 12:43.451
Must be something wrong with it.

12:43.453 --> 12:45.311
I bet there's nothing
wrong with the plug.

12:45.313 --> 12:47.799
- You know what I bet the problem is?
- Hmm?

12:47.801 --> 12:51.794
Those big sausage fingers of yours.

12:52.733 --> 12:56.608
Hey, man, that-that was kind of hurtful.

12:56.610 --> 12:58.518
It was a joke.

12:58.520 --> 13:00.445
Fat-shaming my digits.

13:01.782 --> 13:02.948
Not cool.

13:02.950 --> 13:05.308
It's kind of quiet in here.

13:05.310 --> 13:06.809
Why don't we put on some music?

13:06.811 --> 13:08.330
Oh, no, no, no, no.

13:08.332 --> 13:10.355
Last week, you played Jethro Tull.

13:10.357 --> 13:12.291
You know what does not
belong in rock and roll?

13:12.293 --> 13:14.776
A flute.

13:14.778 --> 13:18.279
Sorry if I don't want to
work on a muscle car to Adele.

13:18.281 --> 13:20.465
Hilarious burn.

13:20.467 --> 13:21.875
I'm gonna get a beer.

13:21.877 --> 13:24.285
Yeah? Why don't you go tell your mama?

13:24.287 --> 13:25.773
Man, don't talk about my mama.

13:25.775 --> 13:27.789
- I'm making a stupid joke.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

13:27.791 --> 13:29.641
No, you were talking about my mama.

13:31.770 --> 13:34.202
How come this trash talk
was fun when Joe was here?

13:34.204 --> 13:37.021
To be honest with you,
because ball busting's a science.

13:37.023 --> 13:39.175
- Ah.
- It takes at least three people.

13:39.177 --> 13:40.843
Oh, is that the rule?

13:40.845 --> 13:42.845
With two people, you
just pick on each other.

13:42.847 --> 13:44.990
With three, it becomes a sadistic,

13:44.992 --> 13:46.867
horrible, fun game.

13:48.020 --> 13:50.210
Gentlemen, I am stepping out.

13:50.212 --> 13:53.929
Bonnie and I are taking a
watercolor class tonight.

13:53.931 --> 13:56.835
- By my count, we now have three people.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:56.837 --> 13:59.320
You know, Ed, you might want to
make sure you put your smock on

13:59.322 --> 14:00.672
and cover up that sun dress.

14:00.674 --> 14:02.131
Oh, burn!

14:02.133 --> 14:04.492
Oh, oh, and if there's
any paint left over,

14:04.494 --> 14:06.845
maybe you and Bonnie can
do each other's nails.

14:06.847 --> 14:08.778
That's two burns

14:08.780 --> 14:10.113
for the price of one.

14:12.266 --> 14:15.261
Let me tell you jokers something.

14:15.263 --> 14:17.672
Expressing your inner life through art

14:17.674 --> 14:20.525
is nothing short of transcendent.

14:20.527 --> 14:23.719
Now, if you'll excuse me, I
don't want to get there late

14:23.721 --> 14:26.222
and have to park in the alley.

14:26.224 --> 14:28.325
That's where the bums urinate.

14:34.065 --> 14:36.858
I guess the game doesn't
work with just anybody.

14:36.860 --> 14:38.785
Face it, we need Joe.

14:38.787 --> 14:40.695
Yeah, why don't you go tell your mama.

14:40.697 --> 14:41.697
What was that?

14:43.050 --> 14:45.717
I was just saying how... how much I...

14:45.719 --> 14:48.428
I miss Obama.

14:57.550 --> 14:59.382
Hey, Mike Baxter here for Outdoor Man,

14:59.384 --> 15:01.048
talking about chemistry.

15:01.050 --> 15:03.118
No, it's not just about lighting methane

15:03.120 --> 15:05.386
and hydrogen sulfide
and shooting a blue angel

15:05.388 --> 15:07.017
from your nether regions.

15:07.019 --> 15:09.515
Man, I miss college.

15:09.517 --> 15:12.500
It also happens when a bunch
of people work well together.

15:12.502 --> 15:14.066
Like the cast of Love Boat.

15:14.068 --> 15:16.063
That episode with Captain Stubing's dad?

15:16.065 --> 15:20.067
If you didn't cry watching
that, I don't want to know you.

15:20.069 --> 15:23.163
British rock band The
Who had great chemistry.

15:23.165 --> 15:26.282
Peter Townshend, Roger
Daltrey, John Entwistle...

15:26.284 --> 15:29.952
and their wild man on drums, Keith Moon.

15:29.954 --> 15:31.684
Do you know how much it takes

15:31.686 --> 15:34.123
to be a crazy one in a rock band?

15:34.125 --> 15:36.011
Moon the Loon, as they called him.

15:36.013 --> 15:37.343
Had a way of pushing their buttons.

15:37.345 --> 15:39.726
He also pushed them
to rock and roll glory.

15:39.728 --> 15:42.943
Now, legend has it that it
was right after Keith said,

15:42.945 --> 15:44.943
"Hey, pull my finger",
that Townshend wrote

15:44.945 --> 15:47.929
"Won't Get Fooled Again".

15:47.931 --> 15:50.598
Once Keith was gone,
it just wasn't the same.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.600
That's the thing about chemistry, folks.

15:52.602 --> 15:55.144
You need all the elements
to make a perfect compound.

15:55.146 --> 15:57.681
Two hydrogen molecules can't do squat

15:57.683 --> 16:00.441
until an oxygen molecule
turns them into water.

16:00.443 --> 16:02.818
And then they ruin a baseball game.

16:02.820 --> 16:05.369
So don't take the little
things for granted.

16:05.371 --> 16:08.654
Whether it's an atom or one
of these hand-tied lures.

16:08.656 --> 16:11.958
Right? Which we have on sale
all this week at Outdoor Man.

16:11.960 --> 16:14.881
Because if you only
got a rod and a line,

16:14.883 --> 16:18.292
you're just a weird guy with a stick.

16:18.294 --> 16:19.895
Baxter out.

16:25.343 --> 16:28.228
- Hey, Ryan.
- Hey.

16:28.230 --> 16:29.488
Hello.

16:30.991 --> 16:32.848
Slow day, huh?

16:32.850 --> 16:34.400
No stoners?

16:34.402 --> 16:36.703
They don't like to be called stoners.

16:36.705 --> 16:39.178
Uh, "blunt buddies"?

16:39.180 --> 16:41.649
"Spliff jockeys"? "Bong pirates"?

16:41.651 --> 16:43.693
They're just people, Kyle.

16:43.695 --> 16:45.245
People don't like labels.

16:45.247 --> 16:47.080
See, he's still mad.

16:47.082 --> 16:49.031
Mad? No, I'm not mad.

16:49.033 --> 16:50.967
I'd hug you, but it's flu season.

16:52.036 --> 16:53.828
All right, give him the gift.

16:53.830 --> 16:56.875
Okay, so we found this
at a vintage shop in LoDo.

16:56.877 --> 16:58.225
It's just like the one I ruined.

17:02.005 --> 17:03.671
You guys didn't have to do that.

17:03.673 --> 17:06.173
We wanted to. We felt bad.

17:06.175 --> 17:08.550
Now I feel bad.

17:08.553 --> 17:10.511
I may have overreacted the other day,

17:10.512 --> 17:12.680
like I do with everything
else in my life. I suck!

17:12.682 --> 17:14.682
No, you don't.

17:14.684 --> 17:17.523
Yeah, I do. I'm uptight.
I don't let things go.

17:17.526 --> 17:18.853
I know it drives you guys crazy.

17:18.855 --> 17:20.539
It doesn't.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.098
Yeah, right.

17:22.099 --> 17:26.260
Ryan, we love every odd,
wonderful, weird thing you do.

17:26.262 --> 17:28.597
Really? So, when we
go out to restaurants,

17:28.599 --> 17:30.573
I have to check all the tables first,
that doesn't bother you?

17:30.575 --> 17:32.408
Have we ever sat at a wobbly table?

17:32.410 --> 17:35.113
Uh, we have not. Thank you, Ryan.

17:35.115 --> 17:37.997
Okay, and when we went to
the Natural History Museum

17:37.999 --> 17:40.041
and I took over for the
tour guide, not annoying?

17:40.043 --> 17:42.251
No. She knew nothing about the Ice Age.

17:42.253 --> 17:44.229
But she sure did four hours later.

17:45.548 --> 17:47.307
Again, thank you, Ryan.

17:47.309 --> 17:50.551
So, you don't mind that I'm not chill?

17:50.553 --> 17:52.571
No. We appreciate it.

17:52.573 --> 17:55.315
When you worry about
stuff, we don't have to.

17:55.317 --> 17:58.076
We get to enjoy life because you don't.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.935
Thanks.

17:59.937 --> 18:01.562
And the shirt is great.

18:01.564 --> 18:04.440
You know, even if it is different.

18:04.442 --> 18:06.465
What do you mean, different?

18:06.467 --> 18:07.990
Uh, it-it's not a big deal.

18:07.992 --> 18:10.076
I mean, Fire Falcon has
11 feathers on his tail,

18:10.078 --> 18:11.579
and this one only has
ten, so it's not...

18:11.581 --> 18:12.832
You know, actually, you know what?

18:12.834 --> 18:15.260
It's totally fine. I love it. Thank you.

18:15.262 --> 18:18.004
You're welcome.

18:18.006 --> 18:20.098
See you.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.183
Told you he'd notice.

18:26.255 --> 18:28.422
So, you summoned me?

18:28.424 --> 18:30.942
Thanks for coming up, Joe.

18:30.944 --> 18:33.183
Not like I had any choice,
okay? You're the boss.

18:33.185 --> 18:36.597
You say, "Jump", I
say, "Off what cliff?"

18:36.599 --> 18:40.948
Actually, the correct
response is the closest one.

18:40.950 --> 18:43.048
You know, I didn't just
quit the car group, okay?

18:43.050 --> 18:44.055
- I quit this.
- Okay, stop.

18:44.057 --> 18:45.288
I know that you're upset,

18:45.290 --> 18:47.792
so that's why I wanted to talk to you.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.294
I'm listening.

18:49.296 --> 18:51.796
Okay, this may come as a shock to you

18:51.798 --> 18:55.116
and something I try to
hide, but I genuinely

18:55.118 --> 18:56.426
do not like you.

18:57.829 --> 18:59.971
- Hey!
- Not a fan.

18:59.973 --> 19:02.158
Geez, Baxter, is that
supposed to be an apology?

19:02.160 --> 19:04.060
No. I just wanted to
get that out of the way

19:04.062 --> 19:07.187
before I tell you that
I do appreciate you.

19:09.831 --> 19:11.478
Go on.

19:11.480 --> 19:14.713
I want you around in the limited context

19:14.715 --> 19:16.348
of working with Chuck.

19:16.350 --> 19:18.581
- So you like me.
- No.

19:18.583 --> 19:20.566
That's not what it is.

19:20.568 --> 19:23.477
I appreciate you. Okay?

19:23.479 --> 19:26.331
Like, uh, I don't like root canals,

19:26.333 --> 19:28.124
but I appreciate their value.

19:30.595 --> 19:32.946
Well, you're the shy one, aren't you?

19:35.008 --> 19:37.250
I like you, too.

19:37.252 --> 19:40.086
No, no, I tolerate you

19:40.088 --> 19:42.922
on certain specific occasions.

19:42.924 --> 19:44.707
What's this, Valentine's Day?

19:44.709 --> 19:48.508
You keep gushing, and I'm
gonna have to call HR, okay?

19:48.510 --> 19:49.958
We're done. Get out.

19:49.960 --> 19:51.881
No, you know something?
You know something?

19:51.883 --> 19:53.846
- You're-you're like my hairless Egyptian, okay?
- Stop it!

19:53.848 --> 19:55.908
No, no.

19:55.910 --> 19:59.043
You know, keeps her distance,
doesn't like to cuddle,

19:59.045 --> 20:01.056
but every now and then,
she gives me that look,

20:01.058 --> 20:05.611
and I know we have an unbreakable bond.

20:05.613 --> 20:08.990
You know, all your
cats would abandon you

20:08.992 --> 20:10.950
if you left the door open.

20:10.952 --> 20:14.069
Look, I'll come back
on one condition, okay?

20:14.071 --> 20:15.547
I want a nickname.

20:15.549 --> 20:17.790
I got a nickname for you.

20:17.792 --> 20:20.701
I want to pick it so it's cool.

20:20.703 --> 20:22.887
Done. Except I want veto power.

20:22.889 --> 20:25.798
- Look, I keep everything running around here.
- Right.

20:25.800 --> 20:29.310
So I want to be "the Gas Man".

20:32.566 --> 20:35.066
I'll never call you anything else, Joe.

20:43.434 --> 20:44.892
Oh, okay.

20:44.894 --> 20:47.061
Uh, a movie, a movie.

20:47.063 --> 20:48.112
Two words.

20:48.114 --> 20:49.230
Okay, first word.

20:49.232 --> 20:50.990
- Ooh, it's small.
- "The".

20:50.992 --> 20:52.091
Second word.

20:52.093 --> 20:53.942
Ooh, fingers. No, thumbs.

20:53.944 --> 20:56.166
- Finger Thumbs.
- The Finger Thumbs.

20:56.168 --> 20:57.669
Finger Thumbs the Movie.

20:57.671 --> 20:59.303
Ah, no, Finger Thumbs Two.

20:59.305 --> 21:01.283
Waving. Flapping.

21:01.285 --> 21:03.169
Oh, uh, The Seal.

21:03.171 --> 21:05.148
- An airplane. An airplane.
- The Airplane.

21:05.150 --> 21:06.230
Time.

21:06.232 --> 21:07.790
The Birds!

21:07.792 --> 21:10.009
Alfred Hitchcock. The Birds.

21:10.011 --> 21:12.461
What could this possibly be? The Seals?

21:12.463 --> 21:14.088
Oh, my God. You know, it's cool.

21:14.090 --> 21:17.382
It's cool. It's a game. I'm cool.

21:17.384 --> 21:19.498
Isn't he eventually going to catch on

21:19.500 --> 21:22.355
- what we're doing to him?
- I hope not.

21:22.357 --> 21:25.024
Oh, this is way better than charades.

21:25.026 --> 21:27.527
Okay, the next one is gonna be Airplane!

21:27.529 --> 21:30.797
Make sure we all say The Birds.
