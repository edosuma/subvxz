WEBVTT

01:35.846 --> 01:37.389
<i>It's the Boxer.</i>

01:47.941 --> 01:49.735
<i>He's dead all right.</i>

03:27.541 --> 03:30.168
Pull over!

04:42.616 --> 04:44.284
Can I get in?

04:45.035 --> 04:47.204
No room?
- All full.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.461
Climb up here.

04:57.672 --> 05:00.175
<i>I'll</i> stay here, thanks.

06:03.947 --> 06:06.616
Driver, papers.

06:11.955 --> 06:13.874
- Where are you going?
- Home.

06:13.999 --> 06:16.126
Where's your home?

06:16.293 --> 06:19.462
The coffee plantation
further down that way.

06:19.588 --> 06:23.675
There used to be a roadblock here.
Did you ever pay them?

06:23.800 --> 06:25.719
Yes, I think I did once.

06:25.844 --> 06:26.970
How much?

06:27.137 --> 06:29.723
I can't remember.
A hundred dollars.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.433
To those thugs?

06:31.558 --> 06:33.810
No wonder they act above the law!

06:34.644 --> 06:36.980
I had to get through.
Everyone pays.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.901
That's what breeds corruption.

06:41.318 --> 06:45.071
Because of people like you,
this country is filthy.

07:03.006 --> 07:04.841
Can I sit down, sir?

09:16.890 --> 09:19.684
<i>To those ensconced
deep in the forest:</i>

09:20.101 --> 09:22.979
<i>Wake up.
Leave your hideouts.</i>

09:24.814 --> 09:29.194
<i>Herbs to tone
those flabby muscles...</i>

09:30.904 --> 09:32.989
<i>and render you</i>

09:33.114 --> 09:34.657
<i>invisible</i>

09:35.116 --> 09:37.494
<i>and invulnerable.</i>

09:55.428 --> 09:58.765
Madame Vial!

09:59.015 --> 10:01.559
This is your last warning!

10:02.644 --> 10:04.646
You must leave immediately!

10:17.200 --> 10:18.868
Madame Vial!

10:19.327 --> 10:22.705
The French army is pulling out!
We're leaving!

10:22.831 --> 10:24.874
You'll be completely cut off!

10:26.084 --> 10:28.253
Think it over, Madame Vial!

10:28.628 --> 10:30.296
Think of your family!

10:35.301 --> 10:37.137
We're pulling out!

10:46.688 --> 10:49.065
You must leave immediately!

11:36.154 --> 11:37.947
SURVIVAL KIT

11:40.283 --> 11:43.036
“These whites,
these dirty whites.

11:44.454 --> 11:46.331
They look down on us,

11:46.497 --> 11:48.499
and we risk our lives for them.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.336
They're a bunch
of nouveaux riches,

11:51.461 --> 11:54.505
pretentious, arrogant, ignorant.

11:55.548 --> 11:58.801
They don't deserve
this beautiful land.

11:59.010 --> 12:02.972
They can't even appreciate it!”

13:50.663 --> 13:52.999
GOD DOESN'T GIVE UP

17:08.402 --> 17:10.488
Where are you going?

17:13.156 --> 17:15.576
Where are you going?
- No way to stay.

17:15.701 --> 17:18.371
You can't leave.
We just started.

17:18.538 --> 17:19.622
Let's go back.

17:19.789 --> 17:23.792
You know it too! You can't stay.
You heard it from above.

17:24.252 --> 17:25.419
Just listen!

17:25.586 --> 17:29.507
I just need one week.
Five days or the crop will be ruined.

17:29.632 --> 17:33.386
Five days is nothing.
Things have been bad for months.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.930
Your foremen are leaving too.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.723
Ange and Maurice? I doubt it.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.434
They are, and so are we.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.186
This is getting bad.

17:42.353 --> 17:46.065
Let's go, before trouble
catches up with us.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.151
Hold on.

17:52.238 --> 17:54.532
Stay here.
Why are you leaving?

17:54.991 --> 17:57.827
Suffering and war everywhere!

17:57.994 --> 17:59.870
One week!

18:19.932 --> 18:21.434
Ange!

19:28.459 --> 19:31.087
You can't go, Maurice.
What will we do?

19:32.296 --> 19:34.757
We need a week.
You saw the crops.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.676
One week at the most.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.304
Not even a week.

19:40.930 --> 19:44.892
All of a sudden you can't stay?
It's too dangerous?

19:46.268 --> 19:48.979
Actually,
it might be less dangerous.

19:52.316 --> 19:55.820
We don't have to be terrorized.
We can fight back.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.364
That copter didn't come for fun.

19:58.781 --> 20:02.368
It came for you and your family,
not for us.

20:05.079 --> 20:06.455
Andre' is right.

20:06.956 --> 20:10.251
Coffee's coffee.
Not worth dying for.

20:13.379 --> 20:14.880
Where are your kids?

20:15.339 --> 20:17.049
Out of harm's way.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.469
Out of harm's way.
Open your eyes!

20:20.636 --> 20:22.054
You have a son.

20:22.179 --> 20:23.806
Get him out of bed.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.474
Let him go pick.

20:25.766 --> 20:28.144
You have no right to criticize Manuel!

20:28.436 --> 20:30.688
Get lost!
Never come back again!

20:30.855 --> 20:33.733
Never! You hear me, Maurice?

20:46.287 --> 20:47.788
Andre'?

20:55.337 --> 20:57.381
<i>Andre' isn't here.</i>

21:05.306 --> 21:07.183
Andre', Andre'...

24:00.105 --> 24:02.691
I knew it.
They can't take you down.

24:02.858 --> 24:05.110
Not you, not the Boxer.

24:27.049 --> 24:28.717
I always said...

24:29.551 --> 24:31.929
if I could meet the Boxer

24:32.137 --> 24:33.806
and fight for him...

24:34.848 --> 24:36.725
I'd ask God for nothing else.

24:36.892 --> 24:38.644
NO K.O.'s

25:08.173 --> 25:10.009
Where is this from?

25:11.260 --> 25:13.595
Where?
- The plantation down there.

25:16.974 --> 25:18.934
It's just white material.

25:39.747 --> 25:42.958
Get up, Manuel, please.
I need you.

26:29.797 --> 26:31.381
Who's there?

26:43.685 --> 26:45.521
What are you doing here?

26:45.646 --> 26:47.439
Waiting for my uncle.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.487
Are you Jean-Marie's nephew?

26:55.948 --> 26:57.866
Does he know you're here?

26:59.660 --> 27:01.411
He'll be glad to see me.

27:07.084 --> 27:09.169
Are you thirsty?

27:10.379 --> 27:12.339
You want something to eat?

27:52.963 --> 27:54.464
Lucie!

27:56.758 --> 27:59.469
Where are you going?
- To pick up José.

27:59.595 --> 28:01.972
<i>I'll</i> go. I need to hire workers.

28:02.097 --> 28:03.599
<i>I'll get José after.</i>

28:04.308 --> 28:07.311
- You don't get it!
- You let them scare you!

28:10.772 --> 28:13.567
- You take it.
- This is ridiculous.

28:16.069 --> 28:17.946
Who opened the safe?

28:18.113 --> 28:19.573
Why ask me?

28:19.698 --> 28:22.367
Look, it's a mess inside.

28:24.369 --> 28:26.079
Ask Andre'.

28:27.164 --> 28:28.999
I don't have the keys.

30:06.513 --> 30:07.514
Okay, man.

30:10.767 --> 30:12.269
Leaving?

30:12.936 --> 30:14.563
Just for the village.

30:14.855 --> 30:16.523
<i>It'll</i> be $100.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.900
You're my son's gym teacher.

30:19.401 --> 30:20.527
I'm Maria Vial.

30:21.028 --> 30:24.239
Never saw you before.
$100, whether you go or not.

30:24.406 --> 30:27.868
Cut it out. It's $10 if I go,
zero if I don't.

30:27.993 --> 30:30.037
You know who I am.

30:36.043 --> 30:37.753
I know all of you.

30:37.919 --> 30:41.590
Peter Nembo, Frangois-Joseph.
Your father sells seeds.

30:41.757 --> 30:44.926
Why bring his father into this?
Pay and you get through.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.219
Or else you die.

30:46.345 --> 30:47.846
<i>If she doesn't pay,</i>

30:47.971 --> 30:49.556
<i>I'll waste her!</i>

31:17.125 --> 31:18.502
Hello, Bernard.

31:19.294 --> 31:21.088
Hello, Christine.

31:22.297 --> 31:24.299
You have serious protection!

31:25.217 --> 31:28.512
I'm not so sure.
It's really not much.

31:33.266 --> 31:36.436
Mr. Vial's medicine.
I checked. It's all there.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.480
Except the oxygen.

31:38.605 --> 31:41.483
Andre' will pick it up later.
Got a pen?

31:41.650 --> 31:45.779
Maria, we prefer cash now.
Dollars.

31:46.655 --> 31:48.156
I see.

31:53.662 --> 31:55.622
Take this.

31:56.832 --> 32:02.504
Can you break these bills for me?

32:03.255 --> 32:08.635
<i>Many things are to be found
in Mama's and Papa's homes.</i>

32:09.970 --> 32:12.305
<i>But go about it gently.</i>

32:12.472 --> 32:14.724
<i>Everyone is entitled to his share.</i>

32:14.850 --> 32:16.852
<i>And don't ever forget:</i>

32:17.811 --> 32:21.273
<i>What fate has in store for us</i>

32:21.773 --> 32:23.859
<i>no one can take away.</i>

32:23.984 --> 32:25.569
You should leave.

32:25.735 --> 32:29.322
<i>Beware of impostors,
smooth talkers, and thieves.</i>

32:30.073 --> 32:33.201
As for the white material,
the party's over.

32:34.786 --> 32:37.122
No more cocktails
on shaded verandas

32:37.289 --> 32:39.791
while we sweat water and blood.

32:41.668 --> 32:43.336
They're getting out...

32:44.045 --> 32:46.673
and they're right to run scared.

32:46.923 --> 32:49.426
Our rulers are already trembling,

32:49.551 --> 32:52.596
their suitcases
stuffed with booty

32:52.721 --> 32:55.223
they amassed
while you starved.

33:16.620 --> 33:18.705
Is your Daddy here?

33:18.830 --> 33:20.415
Daddy's not home.

33:46.149 --> 33:48.360
THE MAYOR KEEPS HIS WORD

34:04.668 --> 34:08.463
She'll be stunned that you tried
to sell me the plantation.

34:09.839 --> 34:11.507
You're betraying her.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.138
I'm protecting her from herself.

34:18.806 --> 34:20.809
We no longer turn a profit.

34:21.768 --> 34:24.728
No use getting massacred
over some coffee.

34:25.397 --> 34:28.233
The plantation isn't worth a thing.

34:30.735 --> 34:33.780
I'm glad to hear
the plantation is worthless.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.074
I keep you alive.

34:36.491 --> 34:39.744
Without me,
you'd be rotting on the Garonne.

34:40.661 --> 34:43.373
Come on,
don't get carried away.

34:53.007 --> 34:54.509
Andre'...

34:55.176 --> 34:57.637
it's falling apart, beyond hope.

34:59.180 --> 35:01.975
In six months it'll be raining inside.

35:02.183 --> 35:05.353
It was already too late
when you built it.

35:06.438 --> 35:08.523
That's when you should have left.

35:09.524 --> 35:11.818
At least with your wife and José.

35:13.194 --> 35:15.196
It's a nice piece of land,

35:15.780 --> 35:17.032
but still...

35:17.157 --> 35:19.492
if I add up everything you owe me,

35:19.618 --> 35:23.538
I should, first of all,
seize the plantation,

35:23.872 --> 35:25.498
and second,

35:26.207 --> 35:27.876
kick you out.

35:29.544 --> 35:32.839
And you'd still owe me
and the government.

35:40.096 --> 35:41.264
Enough.

35:42.932 --> 35:44.934
Get your father's signature.

35:51.733 --> 35:53.401
<i>Have your Fanta.</i>

35:54.903 --> 35:56.696
This is my Fanta.

35:59.240 --> 36:00.909
Is this what you want?

36:06.956 --> 36:08.625
Those are my men.

36:10.085 --> 36:12.504
They can take you to the border.

36:12.671 --> 36:15.090
Pay them cash.
Keep it between us.

36:17.258 --> 36:19.094
Got any gas left?

36:19.636 --> 36:21.554
Yeah, a little.

36:30.814 --> 36:32.816
Where do they come from?

36:34.693 --> 36:36.403
My personal militia.

36:38.488 --> 36:41.825
Your personal militia!
Come on, spare me.

36:43.410 --> 36:46.371
That's how you plan
to stop the rebels?

36:48.123 --> 36:50.125
<i>- Everyone here?
- Yes!</i>

36:50.291 --> 36:51.960
<i>-  Anything to say?</i>
<i>-  Yes! </I></i>

36:52.085 --> 36:54.796
<i>- What is it?
- Knock down the rebels!</i>

38:03.448 --> 38:06.534
I have work to be done,
a harvest to finish.

38:06.701 --> 38:08.703
Do you have any men

38:09.329 --> 38:11.289
to come work at my place?

38:12.999 --> 38:14.501
Wait here.

38:19.255 --> 38:20.298
Wait.

39:05.844 --> 39:08.638
So it's half up front,

39:08.763 --> 39:10.640
the other half after.

39:11.266 --> 39:14.102
Three meals a day... and cola nuts.

39:55.685 --> 39:59.731
It's quiet. We've never had trouble.
And it's just a few days.

40:00.023 --> 40:01.816
Shall we go?

40:05.445 --> 40:08.031
TAKE DOWN THE BOXER!

40:10.867 --> 40:12.619
Why “take down”?

40:13.453 --> 40:15.997
They say they killed him.
It's bad for us.

40:16.164 --> 40:18.207
Now it will get even worse.

41:04.837 --> 41:06.881
STAND FIRM

41:41.582 --> 41:43.418
<i>Start running now.</i>

41:43.584 --> 41:45.420
<i>Things are getting dangerous.</i>

41:45.586 --> 41:47.880
<i>Get going now. It's bad.</i>

41:48.047 --> 41:51.926
<i>We can't get caught
between the army and the rebels.</i>

41:53.761 --> 41:55.930
How can he judge the danger?

41:56.097 --> 41:58.224
If we start believing the radio...

42:00.101 --> 42:04.564
After this job,
I'm buying a motorbike and I'm off.

42:08.317 --> 42:10.153
My daughter is sick.

42:10.945 --> 42:12.572
She's too young.

42:12.989 --> 42:14.449
No choice but to stay.

42:16.784 --> 42:18.369
What's wrong with her?

42:19.454 --> 42:22.040
I don't know. She's in bed.

42:22.165 --> 42:23.833
She doesn't move.

42:25.334 --> 42:27.170
Did you try the clinic?

42:29.255 --> 42:31.049
It's too late now.

42:43.061 --> 42:45.980
I need to pick someone up.
<i>I'll</i> be right back.

43:06.501 --> 43:08.211
Are you his mother?

43:09.378 --> 43:11.672
His stepmother?
- Not exactly.

43:13.007 --> 43:15.843
You have to tell me who you are.

43:15.968 --> 43:19.889
I'm his father's ex-wife.
José is my son's half brother.

43:20.014 --> 43:23.518
Listen, I'm in a hurry.
Can you go get him?

43:25.228 --> 43:26.562
Go yourself.

43:26.687 --> 43:28.439
I should go?

43:28.689 --> 43:30.191
Thank you.

43:34.362 --> 43:36.572
José, I'm taking you home.

43:36.948 --> 43:38.699
Gather your belongings.

43:43.955 --> 43:45.832
Hurry UP-

43:55.883 --> 43:57.885
Soon it will be empty here.

43:58.052 --> 44:00.054
Have many kids left already?

44:04.433 --> 44:06.894
Your mother wants you at home.

44:07.019 --> 44:10.356
No one cares about the school.
Why would they come here?

44:10.481 --> 44:12.650
I don't know, José. I really don't.

44:14.026 --> 44:15.903
I just hired some workers.

44:16.028 --> 44:18.614
They're in the truck.

44:19.157 --> 44:20.992
Will you help out too?

44:21.117 --> 44:22.618
No problem.

44:24.412 --> 44:25.913
No problem...

44:26.706 --> 44:29.208
With you there's never any problem.

44:29.709 --> 44:31.502
You make it all seem easy.

44:37.508 --> 44:40.595
- Why are you here?
- I came to pick up José.

44:40.803 --> 44:42.805
I didn't know you'd be here.

44:43.431 --> 44:45.516
You had to hire workers.

44:45.641 --> 44:48.811
Everyone left, even Ange and Maurice.
There's no one.

44:48.936 --> 44:50.646
And I found the gate open.

44:50.771 --> 44:53.107
Ange and Maurice are gone?
Damn.

44:54.317 --> 44:57.945
You don't seem too upset.
I wonder if you already knew.

45:12.418 --> 45:15.129
Lucie said you could get gas.

45:15.713 --> 45:18.799
That's right.
<i>I'll</i> have some tomorrow.

45:23.346 --> 45:27.600
- Your son?
- Not him, but I have a son too.

46:01.008 --> 46:02.802
Are you the boss?

46:03.052 --> 46:06.681
Yes. I mean... in a way.

46:07.265 --> 46:09.517
Nothing's mine, but I'm in charge.

46:10.309 --> 46:13.396
When it's not yours,
it's just hot air.

46:59.692 --> 47:01.360
You scared me.

47:03.195 --> 47:05.323
I thought I'd die last night.

47:05.990 --> 47:07.575
Don't say that.

47:09.577 --> 47:12.455
Tomorrow we'll put you
in Andre's room.

47:12.580 --> 47:14.248
It's air-conditioned.

47:15.750 --> 47:17.084
Maria...

47:17.918 --> 47:19.670
I was born here.

47:20.671 --> 47:22.882
That old place of yours
is my home.

47:24.133 --> 47:26.093
<i>That's where I feel best.</i>

47:27.636 --> 47:29.472
<i>The plantation is yours.</i>

47:30.014 --> 47:31.766
<i>It's all yours.</i>

48:19.355 --> 48:21.690
See? I didn't need it.

48:21.816 --> 48:23.609
Did Manuel come and help?

48:23.734 --> 48:25.653
Your Manuel? He's a good kid.

48:25.820 --> 48:27.363
A little sluggish.

48:27.613 --> 48:29.240
A lousy picker.

48:29.365 --> 48:31.534
Ripe or not, he doesn't care.

48:32.618 --> 48:35.246
Please don't badmouth
my son, Lucie.

48:37.665 --> 48:40.501
I don't talk about yours.
You do the same, okay?

48:40.668 --> 48:42.920
Mine is a different story.

49:28.841 --> 49:32.136
Manuel, get up.
How can you spend all day in bed?

49:32.386 --> 49:34.388
Get up!
" Lay off!

49:34.513 --> 49:36.182
Watch your mouth!

49:37.892 --> 49:40.686
I don't know what to do.
You disappoint me.

49:42.897 --> 49:44.773
School's closed anyway.

49:44.899 --> 49:48.068
Nothing interests you.
You loaf around all day.

49:48.194 --> 49:51.322
We can't even talk.
It's like we don't exist.

49:51.447 --> 49:54.533
No need to talk.
I'm sick of this blah-blah.

49:54.742 --> 49:58.078
<i>I'll</i> send you to France.
You'll see the difference.

49:59.747 --> 50:02.082
Move it, Manuel! Get up!

50:04.835 --> 50:06.587
I don't know what happened.

50:07.755 --> 50:10.132
I can't believe you're my son.

50:10.257 --> 50:12.092
I feel like a total failure.

50:13.385 --> 50:16.722
If I met a woman
with a son like you, I'd think...

50:16.847 --> 50:18.891
“Lousy upbringing.
What a waste.”

50:21.560 --> 50:23.020
Okay, <i>I'll</i> get UP-

50:25.606 --> 50:28.067
Leave so I can get dressed.
Where's the fire?

50:28.192 --> 50:31.403
Losing a crop
is worse than a fire.

50:31.529 --> 50:33.697
And letting yourself go

50:33.822 --> 50:37.243
is the vilest thing a boy can do.
It's loathsome.

50:38.827 --> 50:40.246
Come on, get up.

50:40.371 --> 50:42.122
Okay, I'm coming.

50:42.248 --> 50:43.749
I'm coming.

51:34.717 --> 51:36.343
Why did you yell?

51:36.468 --> 51:38.429
I thought I saw something.

51:53.527 --> 51:56.071
<i>It'll</i> be fine, son.
You'll see.

51:56.196 --> 51:57.656
<i>It'll be</i> fine.

52:04.913 --> 52:07.916
<i>Listen up, rascals,
wherever you are.</i>

52:08.417 --> 52:10.085
<i>Listen to my words.</i>

52:11.795 --> 52:14.214
<i>Fearless young rascals...</i>

52:15.299 --> 52:18.177
the Boxer is back.
He's in hiding.

52:21.180 --> 52:22.806
Go find him.

52:23.641 --> 52:26.060
<i>Get out there and find him.</i>

53:13.148 --> 53:15.275
Go on, Manuel. Get dressed.

53:19.571 --> 53:22.574
We need to crack down.
He does nothing all day.

53:22.700 --> 53:24.910
School's out of the question now.

53:25.035 --> 53:27.454
They're all closed, and for good.

53:27.621 --> 53:29.373
You know what I just saw?

53:29.498 --> 53:32.459
Two kids with a machete
and a spear.

53:34.336 --> 53:36.505
<i>I'll</i> tell Jean-Marie tonight.

53:36.630 --> 53:38.382
Where is Jean-Marie?

53:38.507 --> 53:40.634
I'm sure he hasn't left.

53:44.304 --> 53:45.806
Help me down?

53:47.641 --> 53:51.145
Those two kids were strange,
threatening.

53:51.687 --> 53:53.689
I thought they'd...
- What?

53:54.273 --> 53:56.608
I don't know. Attack Manuel.

53:59.403 --> 54:00.904
I'm going.

54:04.533 --> 54:08.120
We won't even be able
to sell the coffee now.

54:08.245 --> 54:10.164
You're becoming defeatist.

54:10.330 --> 54:13.292
If we harvest it,
its value will increase.

54:13.417 --> 54:15.836
What if we all
went back to France?

54:15.961 --> 54:18.922
Why did you see the mayor?
I saw your motorbike.

54:19.047 --> 54:20.549
He's formed a militia.

54:20.716 --> 54:22.551
I asked him for protection.

54:22.676 --> 54:23.844
Why not tell me?

54:24.011 --> 54:26.096
Tell me these things first.

54:26.221 --> 54:29.892
And you can't take the money
without telling me.

55:24.738 --> 55:26.740
Yellow dog.

57:07.299 --> 57:08.759
Shit.

58:04.356 --> 58:05.941
Yellow dog.

59:18.680 --> 59:20.140
Manuel?

59:22.142 --> 59:25.187
<i>It came from here. Follow me!</i>

59:46.166 --> 59:47.584
Look.

59:49.002 --> 59:52.339
We never check here.
It's been like this for months.

59:57.135 --> 01:00:00.430
- There are footprints right there.
- Here?

01:00:01.515 --> 01:00:03.141
Left by kids.

01:00:04.684 --> 01:00:06.728
It must be young shepherds...

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:09.606
who wanted to...

01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:12.192
run off with a sheep.

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:21.451
Armed young shepherds.

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:31.294
It's nothing. I hurt my foot.

01:00:31.419 --> 01:00:33.046
Show me.

01:00:34.172 --> 01:00:36.049
Ride on the tractor with me.

01:00:36.216 --> 01:00:37.926
We'll get the trailer.

01:00:38.552 --> 01:00:40.595
We'll manage. It's nothing.

01:00:44.599 --> 01:00:45.684
Climb up.

01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:54.526
Don't stand there, José.

01:00:58.071 --> 01:01:00.031
What did you do to your hair?

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.285
Your father says happiness
isn't enough for me.

01:01:48.622 --> 01:01:51.958
I have nowhere to go.
I won't give this up.

01:01:54.127 --> 01:01:56.963
You're my son.
I can't let you drift away.

01:01:58.798 --> 01:02:00.800
You know I won't let you go.

01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:20.445
Manuel?

01:03:03.989 --> 01:03:08.034
<i>From Sylvie S., for her parents
and her sister-in-law:</i>

01:03:09.494 --> 01:03:13.665
<i>“Leaving devil's lair.
Will send new address.”</i>

01:03:47.365 --> 01:03:52.245
<i>From Frangois and Vincent N.
for their sister, Elisabeth:</i>

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:56.374
<i>“We'll pry you
from their filthy grip.</i>

01:03:57.792 --> 01:04:00.253
<i>Get ready.
We're on our way.”</i>

01:05:58.037 --> 01:06:00.582
Drop the rifle.
What are you doing?

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:04.043
Drop it!

01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:05.503
You're crazy!

01:06:05.628 --> 01:06:07.839
Go away! Beat it, filthy dog!

01:06:07.964 --> 01:06:10.842
This isn't your home.
Your father sold it!

01:06:14.304 --> 01:06:16.222
Get lost, you little shit!

01:06:17.599 --> 01:06:19.184
Get lost.

01:06:24.689 --> 01:06:26.399
You're sick.

01:06:31.863 --> 01:06:34.407
The patriots will kill you all!

01:06:34.532 --> 01:06:35.909
All of you!

01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:59.516
Shut it off when it's full.

01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:29.272
- Is Manuel back?
- Yes.

01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:33.318
What are you hiding?

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:36.946
Let go!

01:08:46.038 --> 01:08:47.707
You're insane!

01:08:47.832 --> 01:08:49.709
Totally insane!

01:08:50.542 --> 01:08:53.880
You know what this means?
You have any idea?

01:08:57.175 --> 01:08:58.468
We'll all die.

01:09:19.863 --> 01:09:22.492
Push it all to the center.

01:09:22.617 --> 01:09:24.743
Keep it out of the corners.

01:12:00.608 --> 01:12:02.318
Not a good sign.

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:07.240
The power goes out often.
That's why we have a generator.

01:12:09.617 --> 01:12:11.577
This always gets stuck.

01:12:18.918 --> 01:12:20.753
You crank this -

01:12:20.878 --> 01:12:23.381
Don't worry. <i>I'll</i> manage.

01:12:29.679 --> 01:12:31.597
There's not much gas left.

01:12:32.265 --> 01:12:36.435
We know everyone here.
Getting gasoline won't be hard.

01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:39.522
We've been rooted here for years.

01:12:39.772 --> 01:12:41.357
Here we go.

01:14:14.367 --> 01:14:18.371
<i>They're dangerous, very dangerous,
because they're hungry.</i>

01:14:20.873 --> 01:14:23.042
<i>I saw the army of child soldiers.</i>

01:14:23.167 --> 01:14:25.378
<i>Not just boys. Girls too.</i>

01:14:26.212 --> 01:14:29.715
<i>They're orphans.
They saw their parents killed.</i>

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:34.220
<i>Some have walked a hundred miles
in search of the Boxer.</i>

01:14:35.096 --> 01:14:37.556
Why did you lie to me? Why?

01:14:39.183 --> 01:14:41.227
Manuel never came home.

01:14:42.228 --> 01:14:44.313
He did something awful.

01:14:44.605 --> 01:14:45.940
He hurt Elisabeth.

01:14:46.107 --> 01:14:49.360
Did she say that?
What a liar.

01:14:50.236 --> 01:14:51.737
She ran off.

01:14:51.904 --> 01:14:53.364
She's not a liar.

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:55.700
He took my rifle.
He's gone crazy.

01:14:55.825 --> 01:14:59.078
Shut up. I won't discuss
my son with anyone.

01:14:59.203 --> 01:15:01.038
The wires were cut.

01:15:03.791 --> 01:15:06.585
So I'm keeping
the gas for the truck.

01:15:06.711 --> 01:15:07.878
To leave.

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:10.089
Cherif will help us.

01:15:10.756 --> 01:15:12.591
In exchange for what?

01:15:15.177 --> 01:15:16.345
He's our friend.

01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:36.907
Manuel?

01:15:52.173 --> 01:15:54.884
There's everything you need.
You can -

01:15:56.552 --> 01:15:59.472
You can cook.
There are beds.

01:16:00.014 --> 01:16:01.974
You'll be safe here.

01:16:02.725 --> 01:16:04.643
That's for us to decide.

01:16:05.019 --> 01:16:06.979
Here's the flashlight.

01:16:08.564 --> 01:16:10.316
See you tomorrow.

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:15.654
The water pump's over there.

01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:17.907
Okay?

01:16:37.176 --> 01:16:39.512
We have lots of old bones here.

01:16:42.056 --> 01:16:45.810
You won't abandon me?
- I've always looked after you.

01:16:49.146 --> 01:16:50.648
Sign here.

01:16:52.358 --> 01:16:53.526
And here.

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:57.196
And the money?

01:16:58.322 --> 01:16:59.990
What about it?

01:17:03.452 --> 01:17:05.204
Who's paying?

01:17:10.209 --> 01:17:12.294
Cherif's very smart, you know.

01:17:13.921 --> 01:17:16.006
Much smarter than you.

01:17:41.532 --> 01:17:43.909
You okay, Jean-Marie?
Everything okay?

01:17:44.577 --> 01:17:45.953
Fine.

01:17:48.622 --> 01:17:50.291
Glad to hear it.

01:17:56.672 --> 01:17:58.174
You won't leave?

01:18:02.136 --> 01:18:04.680
I'm too old to start all over.

01:18:07.433 --> 01:18:10.269
I couldn't get used
to anywhere else either.

01:18:12.271 --> 01:18:15.024
For you, it's not the same thing.

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:17.401
Not at all.

01:18:18.027 --> 01:18:21.113
You don't want anyone
taking what you have.

01:18:24.116 --> 01:18:25.951
Maybe you're right.

01:18:27.953 --> 01:18:30.122
I cooked some rice.

01:18:33.876 --> 01:18:35.794
Shall I turn on the generator?

01:18:37.129 --> 01:18:38.797
We need gasoline.

01:18:43.802 --> 01:18:47.139
I saw a relative of yours today.
Your nephew.

01:18:53.187 --> 01:18:54.647
He needs some time.

01:19:04.907 --> 01:19:06.825
Have you seen Manuel around?

01:19:17.461 --> 01:19:19.171
Well, I'm going in.

01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:38.292
Your son...

01:20:39.209 --> 01:20:41.086
I can see he's changed.

01:20:44.006 --> 01:20:46.342
It's hard to get through to him.

01:20:48.427 --> 01:20:50.095
He's grown up.

01:20:51.764 --> 01:20:53.432
It's not just that.

01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:58.228
His mind runs all over the place.

01:21:02.024 --> 01:21:03.942
He's become a dog.

01:21:07.071 --> 01:21:08.614
Insane?

01:21:18.832 --> 01:21:20.667
You botched it with him.

01:21:23.087 --> 01:21:24.922
You didn't finish the job.

01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:37.935
You botched it with him...

01:21:44.942 --> 01:21:46.402
Manuel?

01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:49.321
You're here?

01:21:49.988 --> 01:21:51.657
You're wounded.

01:21:55.619 --> 01:21:57.413
What can we do?

01:21:57.579 --> 01:21:59.748
Give me that bottle of water.

01:22:12.678 --> 01:22:15.973
It's no longer safe here
for someone like you.

01:22:16.265 --> 01:22:18.475
For someone like you either.

01:22:24.022 --> 01:22:25.858
This is my son's room.

01:22:38.287 --> 01:22:40.414
Why didn't you leave
with your son?

01:22:40.539 --> 01:22:42.541
I'm a good fighter too.

01:22:42.833 --> 01:22:45.252
How could I show courage
in France?

01:22:45.377 --> 01:22:47.963
It would be absurd,
no rhyme or reason.

01:22:48.755 --> 01:22:51.300
I'd slack off, get too comfortable.

01:22:56.638 --> 01:22:58.307
You're burning up.

01:22:59.391 --> 01:23:02.060
<i>I'll</i> get some medicine tomorrow.

01:24:47.499 --> 01:24:50.669
We now have
the situation under control.

01:24:51.628 --> 01:24:55.257
The rebels no longer
control the area.

01:24:56.341 --> 01:24:58.844
The northern sector has been purged,

01:24:59.303 --> 01:25:01.805
<i>and we'll continue to clean house.</i>

01:25:02.556 --> 01:25:05.225
<i>A reliable source has informed us</i>

01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:09.229
<i>that the rebel soldier, the Boxer,</i>

01:25:09.396 --> 01:25:12.566
<i>is hiding out amidst foreigners</i>

01:25:12.691 --> 01:25:15.986
<i>who rip us off and use our land</i>

01:25:16.111 --> 01:25:20.157
<i>to grow mediocre coffee
that we'd never drink.</i>

01:25:20.532 --> 01:25:23.660
<i>Their accomplices will be eliminated.</i>

01:25:23.785 --> 01:25:25.871
What good is money if you're dead?

01:25:26.038 --> 01:25:27.539
I paid in advance!

01:25:27.706 --> 01:25:30.334
Yes, but you bewitched us
with your words.

01:25:30.459 --> 01:25:32.210
I hear you hide rebels.

01:25:32.377 --> 01:25:34.671
It's not safe.
We want our money.

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:37.758
- Plus a bonus.
- I didn't make you come.

01:25:37.883 --> 01:25:39.051
We must finish!

01:25:39.217 --> 01:25:40.385
Give us our money!

01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:42.846
We want our money!

01:25:45.932 --> 01:25:47.768
Hand it over!

01:25:50.312 --> 01:25:52.564
- The money's gone.
- No way!

01:25:52.689 --> 01:25:54.775
<i>Look, the saws empty.</i>

01:25:55.525 --> 01:25:57.319
Someone stole all our money!

01:25:57.444 --> 01:25:58.945
<i>Rotten luck!</i>

01:25:59.237 --> 01:26:00.906
<i>Can't you see?</i>

01:26:03.450 --> 01:26:06.536
- <i>I'll</i> get more. Here's 200.
- Is that all?

01:26:06.953 --> 01:26:10.624
- Give it to us!
- You'll have the rest tomorrow.

01:26:11.291 --> 01:26:13.418
Take us home.
We won't wait any longer.

01:26:39.403 --> 01:26:41.863
Everyone out! Out!

01:26:55.961 --> 01:26:56.795
Get out!

01:26:58.797 --> 01:27:00.465
No money. We're poor.

01:27:00.632 --> 01:27:02.426
Empty your pockets.

01:27:02.884 --> 01:27:04.636
Everything!

01:27:07.264 --> 01:27:09.266
You can't! We're poor!

01:27:10.517 --> 01:27:13.520
You're crazy! You're crazy!

01:27:37.919 --> 01:27:39.629
Christine! Bernard!

01:28:38.855 --> 01:28:41.691
Go away! He's dead now!

01:30:00.478 --> 01:30:02.480
I know where the Boxer is!

01:30:02.647 --> 01:30:04.441
He's at my place!

01:30:05.984 --> 01:30:07.652
Wait for me!

01:30:13.825 --> 01:30:15.660
I know where the Boxer is!

01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:27.125
Please, sir,
can you pull over?

01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:30.628
This is where I get off.

01:32:30.795 --> 01:32:33.423
Driver, white lady wants to get off.

01:32:34.549 --> 01:32:36.176
I'm not stopping here.

01:32:36.468 --> 01:32:39.596
That's where I'm going.
Please pull over.

01:32:39.721 --> 01:32:41.347
I'm not stopping here.

01:32:41.473 --> 01:32:43.308
It's dangerous here now.

01:37:12.535 --> 01:37:14.579
Are you going that way?

01:37:14.954 --> 01:37:16.748
Are you heading back?

01:37:17.999 --> 01:37:19.834
How long till you leave?

01:37:27.258 --> 01:37:30.053
I have to go home.
Tell me how to get home!

01:37:31.179 --> 01:37:34.098
- Where do you live?
- The Vial coffee plantation.

01:37:34.307 --> 01:37:35.558
I know it.

01:37:35.683 --> 01:37:37.185
Marida.

01:37:37.477 --> 01:37:40.563
- My son is there!
- This way.

01:37:49.822 --> 01:37:53.826
<i>- Take her to the Vial plantation.
- The old white guy's place?</i>

01:37:55.036 --> 01:37:56.788
Can't you take me?

01:38:04.629 --> 01:38:06.297
I'm tired.

01:38:32.782 --> 01:38:36.035
Manuel took my motorbike
and disappeared.

01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:38.871
Help me find him.
He can't cope.

01:38:40.081 --> 01:38:42.083
He's defenseless without me.

01:38:46.421 --> 01:38:48.881
Extreme blondness brings bad luck.

01:38:50.133 --> 01:38:52.343
It cries out to be pillaged.

01:38:56.222 --> 01:38:58.224
Blue eyes are troublesome.

01:39:02.103 --> 01:39:04.647
This is his country.
He was born here.

01:39:04.772 --> 01:39:06.941
But it doesn't like him.

01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:15.116
The Boxer is hiding at my place.

01:39:15.658 --> 01:39:17.118
I know.

01:39:26.294 --> 01:39:28.796
Stop the car.
I want to go home alone.

01:42:06.037 --> 01:42:09.665
For the fearless young rascals
For Marie
