00:02.767 --> 00:04.400
(male announcer)
Next is a Bravo scripted
original series.

00:05.733 --> 00:06.867
Babe, I'm buggin'.

00:06.867 --> 00:08.467
Today at pickup,
we were, like,

00:08.467 --> 00:10.367
the only people who
hadn't heard from schools

00:10.367 --> 00:11.667
to set up
the interviews.

00:11.667 --> 00:13.133
Should I call
to check in?

00:13.133 --> 00:15.800
No, you've got to stop thinking
about school applications.

00:15.800 --> 00:17.133
Live your life, honey.

00:17.133 --> 00:19.033
Maybe stop sleeping with
the phone between your boobs.

00:19.033 --> 00:20.733
But what if
I miss the call?

00:20.733 --> 00:21.933
I heard about this woman

00:21.933 --> 00:23.633
who missed the call
from St. Sebastian's,

00:23.633 --> 00:25.033
wound up in
hellish phone tag,

00:25.033 --> 00:27.633
and now her daughter's
a Knicks City Dancer.

00:27.633 --> 00:29.100
[phone rings]

00:29.100 --> 00:30.667
Landline!
Landline!

00:30.667 --> 00:32.333
Okay, okay.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.500
[phone beeps]
- Hello?

00:36.500 --> 00:37.833
Oh, that's exciting.

00:37.833 --> 00:39.933
Interview Friday, yes.

00:39.933 --> 00:44.300
That's fine.
Great. Thank you.

00:44.300 --> 00:45.400
What school?
What time?

00:45.400 --> 00:47.433
It wasn't school.

00:47.433 --> 00:48.633
It's a cemetery.

00:48.633 --> 00:49.867
What?

00:49.867 --> 00:51.867
It's this fancy
application-only cemetery,

00:51.867 --> 00:52.933
Greenacres Park.

00:52.933 --> 00:55.133
You have to apply
to a cemetery?

00:55.133 --> 00:56.867
Mom's been obsessed
with it for years.

00:56.867 --> 00:59.033
They just booted a few more
of the Madoffs,

00:59.033 --> 01:01.067
so now we have a chance
of getting off the wait list.

01:01.067 --> 01:03.333
As if getting into the right
kindergarten weren't enough,

01:03.333 --> 01:05.400
now I have to get
into the right worm buffet?

01:05.400 --> 01:06.733
Honey, my family's
still pissed

01:06.733 --> 01:08.600
that we didn't put the "Von"
back into our name.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.333
We are in the dog house.

01:10.333 --> 01:11.833
We're in
the maison du chien?

01:11.833 --> 01:12.867
Oui.

01:12.867 --> 01:14.300
So just get on board

01:14.300 --> 01:16.633
and come to this
interview tomorrow.

01:16.633 --> 01:18.367
Okay, I will be there,

01:18.367 --> 01:19.767
and I will kill it.

01:19.767 --> 01:22.900
Please don't kill anything.
Just be yourself...

01:22.900 --> 01:25.433
on Xanax.

01:25.433 --> 01:27.933
* Hey, yes, you know *

01:27.933 --> 01:31.467
* I'm feeling fine,
I'm feeling fine *

01:31.467 --> 01:34.067
(Cardiff)
Let me ask you something, Doc.

01:34.067 --> 01:35.133
How old are you?

01:35.133 --> 01:37.133
- 39 and change.
- Mm.

01:37.133 --> 01:38.700
You got kids?

01:38.700 --> 01:40.600
No, and I can
save you the trouble.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.833
My best friend's always on me
to freeze my eggs.

01:42.833 --> 01:44.567
I have cobwebs
on my uterus.

01:44.567 --> 01:46.200
No, don't do it.

01:46.200 --> 01:47.767
Kids take.
They use.

01:47.767 --> 01:50.733
They filch the joy
out of your life.

01:50.733 --> 01:51.900
Really?

01:51.900 --> 01:54.167
But your children seem
so devoted to you.

01:54.167 --> 01:56.300
Ah, they're sharks
circling for chum.

01:56.300 --> 01:58.167
Ingrates, every one of them.

01:58.167 --> 02:00.133
I dropped out of school
in the eighth grade

02:00.133 --> 02:02.700
to support my family
and never stopped.

02:02.700 --> 02:05.800
My kids, they've found
their passions.

02:05.800 --> 02:08.733
Find yours.
See the world.

02:08.733 --> 02:10.600
You mean there's a world
outside this hospital?

02:10.600 --> 02:12.500
[laughing]

02:12.500 --> 02:14.267
You're funny, Doc.

02:14.267 --> 02:16.667
You're like the child
I wish I never had.

02:16.667 --> 02:18.900
[chuckles]

02:18.900 --> 02:21.300
Make me a promise.

02:21.300 --> 02:23.067
Come to my wake.

02:23.067 --> 02:24.300
Mr. Cardiff,
you're not dying.

02:24.300 --> 02:25.633
I've hung out
with a lot of people

02:25.633 --> 02:27.867
right at the end,
and trust me--

02:27.867 --> 02:30.633
[flatline]

02:30.633 --> 02:32.667
Oh, shit.

02:40.967 --> 02:43.533
What's going on, Paul?
I'm kind of swamped here.

02:43.533 --> 02:44.733
Here's the thing.

02:44.733 --> 02:47.100
Emily quit 'cause
she didn't make partner.

02:47.100 --> 02:49.100
I was afraid of that.
She's a friend of mine.

02:49.100 --> 02:50.700
Well, she was pissed.

02:50.700 --> 02:52.100
You should have heard her
on the way out.

02:52.100 --> 02:54.467
Glass ceiling this,
Hillary Clinton that.

02:54.467 --> 02:55.667
Cone of silence--

02:55.667 --> 02:57.367
I think she's going
through early menopause.

02:57.367 --> 02:59.067
Paul, she's, like, 35.

02:59.067 --> 03:00.833
I know.
It's a shame.

03:00.833 --> 03:02.200
Anyway, she's filing

03:02.200 --> 03:05.100
a sexual-discrimination suit
against the firm,

03:05.100 --> 03:06.633
which is weird,

03:06.633 --> 03:08.333
'cause she's not even hot.

03:08.333 --> 03:10.833
We thought you
could handle our defense

03:10.833 --> 03:12.500
because you know
her weaknesses.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.667
Really sink your teeth
into her neck

03:14.667 --> 03:16.833
and just start
shaking and shaking

03:16.833 --> 03:20.233
and shaking,
until she's dead...

03:20.233 --> 03:21.900
legally speaking.

03:25.467 --> 03:27.700
And the best part
is that this cemetery

03:27.700 --> 03:30.933
requires ten letters
of recommendation.

03:30.933 --> 03:32.733
"Ten"?
Come on.

03:32.733 --> 03:34.100
That say what?

03:34.100 --> 03:38.100
"I've never known a family
to decompose with more grace."

03:38.100 --> 03:39.633
"Their offspring
will only leave

03:39.633 --> 03:41.667
the most stylish
flower arrangements."

03:41.667 --> 03:44.700
"They won't slide open
their coffin tops

03:44.700 --> 03:49.267
and rise up to perform
Thriller choreography."

03:51.467 --> 03:53.200
Hey-hee!

03:53.200 --> 03:54.767
Death must be trending.

03:54.767 --> 03:56.900
Tomorrow I have
my very first wake.

03:56.900 --> 03:58.900
Mazel tov.
Who croaked?

03:58.900 --> 04:00.300
This amazing old guy

04:00.300 --> 04:02.967
who practically died
in my arms yesterday.

04:02.967 --> 04:04.433
How Juliette Binoche.

04:04.433 --> 04:06.167
Since when do you
bond enough with patients

04:06.167 --> 04:07.333
to go to their wake?

04:07.333 --> 04:08.567
This guy was special.

04:08.567 --> 04:09.867
And get a load
of his name--

04:09.867 --> 04:12.200
Pendleton Rutledge Cardiff IV.

04:12.200 --> 04:14.500
PRC4 died in your arms?

04:14.500 --> 04:16.667
His obit was, like,
half a page

04:16.667 --> 04:18.967
in the New York Times,
above the fold.

04:18.967 --> 04:20.100
He's "maje."

04:20.100 --> 04:22.200
He's like the Rockefeller
of our day.

04:22.200 --> 04:23.900
I bet you a million bucks

04:23.900 --> 04:26.367
he's RIP-ing
at Greenacres Park.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.233
I have to admit,
being there right when he died

04:28.233 --> 04:29.900
kind of got to me.

04:29.900 --> 04:31.733
It made me think
seriously about--

04:31.733 --> 04:33.067
Hijacking some sperm?

04:33.067 --> 04:34.433
The opposite, actually.

04:34.433 --> 04:36.600
He's the first person
I've ever heard say

04:36.600 --> 04:38.400
he regretted having kids.

04:38.400 --> 04:39.700
Said they were
basically parasites

04:39.700 --> 04:41.067
who sucked
all the time, energy,

04:41.067 --> 04:42.233
and joy out of his life.

04:42.233 --> 04:43.633
He is dead to me.

04:43.633 --> 04:46.200
Well, he's dead, so...

04:46.200 --> 04:49.200
The point is,
I work and I watch TV.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.700
I jog and have
sex occasionally.

04:51.700 --> 04:53.067
What are my passions?

04:53.067 --> 04:54.967
See, the thing
about having kids is,

04:54.967 --> 04:56.100
you don't have to worry

04:56.100 --> 04:57.967
about stupid stuff
like passions.

04:57.967 --> 04:59.100
[chuckles]

04:59.100 --> 05:00.667
Okay, what's on
your bucket list,

05:00.667 --> 05:02.700
aside from banging
Viggo Mortensen

05:02.700 --> 05:04.667
in his full
Lord of the Rings outfit?

05:04.667 --> 05:06.700
I don't know.

05:06.700 --> 05:08.200
I used to be
kind of outdoorsy.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.533
When, in a previous life?

05:10.533 --> 05:12.900
- Oh, my God, tater war!
- [laughs]

05:12.900 --> 05:14.633
Okay, I've got to
drop off the kids,

05:14.633 --> 05:16.333
get gussied up
for my corpse interview,

05:16.333 --> 05:18.967
so we need to get
the Czechoslovakia.

05:26.867 --> 05:28.633
(Jill)
Okay, guys, we're gonna be late!

05:31.200 --> 05:32.933
Love you, have fun.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.500
(Miles)
Happy birthday, BJ!

05:34.500 --> 05:36.400
Thanks, Marisa.
I'll see you in two hours?

05:36.400 --> 05:37.700
No, it's not drop-off.

05:37.700 --> 05:38.867
But, yes, it is.

05:38.867 --> 05:40.400
I double-checked
my Paperless Post.

05:40.400 --> 05:41.433
It said drop-off.

05:41.433 --> 05:42.667
No, not for people
with twins

05:42.667 --> 05:44.433
or kids who have
too much screen time.

05:44.433 --> 05:46.867
And, well, let's face it,
you kind of cover both.

05:46.867 --> 05:48.100
Have some pizza.

05:48.100 --> 05:50.333
It has no crust,
no sauce, no dairy.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.533
Right, sure, I just have
this thing I cannot miss,

05:52.533 --> 05:53.900
- and I didn't realize--
- Stop it, BJ!

05:53.900 --> 05:57.100
Byron James, you get your head
out of her crotch now!

05:59.067 --> 06:01.267
Hey, you're Jill, right?

06:01.267 --> 06:02.800
- Yes.
- Rima.

06:02.800 --> 06:04.900
Hi. You were on the Dalton tour
with me this spring.

06:04.900 --> 06:06.600
Yeah, and Trinity, I think.

06:06.600 --> 06:10.233
So have those schools called you
to set up the interviews yet?

06:10.233 --> 06:11.833
Sorry.
Don't answer that.

06:11.833 --> 06:13.900
I'm trying to stay
as sane as possible

06:13.900 --> 06:15.467
through this process.

06:15.467 --> 06:16.967
But did they?

06:16.967 --> 06:19.167
Yes, but don't worry.
They'll call.

06:19.167 --> 06:22.067
And I'm happy
to watch the twins.

06:22.067 --> 06:24.500
Henry's cousin taught him
to "whip it out" last week,

06:24.500 --> 06:26.267
so I'm not going anywhere.

06:26.267 --> 06:28.167
You are a goddess
among mortals.

06:28.167 --> 06:29.733
Can I give you my cell?

06:40.600 --> 06:42.200
Only Highgate Cemetery
in London

06:42.200 --> 06:43.667
competes with Greenacres.

06:43.667 --> 06:46.067
The Parliament even consulted us
when they were expanding.

06:46.067 --> 06:47.400
[banging]

06:47.400 --> 06:48.900
I am so sorry.

06:48.900 --> 06:51.400
Oh, my God,
the subway took "forevskis,"

06:51.400 --> 06:52.867
and then these tourists
stopped me

06:52.867 --> 06:53.967
to ask for directions,

06:53.967 --> 06:56.067
and it turned into
this whole therapy sesh

06:56.067 --> 06:59.267
about their Airbnb.

06:59.267 --> 07:01.067
What, did I say
something bad?

07:02.400 --> 07:03.900
Oh.

07:03.900 --> 07:06.267
Sorry.
Please continue.

07:07.467 --> 07:09.233
[clears throat]
As I was saying,

07:09.233 --> 07:11.067
our grounds hold some
of the most legendary

07:11.067 --> 07:12.533
members of society--

07:12.533 --> 07:15.800
heads of state,
Barney...of Barney's,

07:15.800 --> 07:18.100
Sunny von Bulow, poor dear.

07:18.100 --> 07:20.900
Most of our aboveground
monuments are made of limestone,

07:20.900 --> 07:24.133
but there is one
that is one continuous piece

07:24.133 --> 07:25.833
of black granite.

07:28.900 --> 07:30.367
Honey, put that away,
please.

07:30.367 --> 07:31.500
I can't.

07:31.500 --> 07:32.633
I have no bars here,

07:32.633 --> 07:34.533
and I need to be available
in case schools call.

07:34.533 --> 07:36.533
They still
haven't called?

07:36.533 --> 07:37.933
Yikes.

07:37.933 --> 07:39.800
Our proximity
to a natural spring

07:39.800 --> 07:43.767
makes for a year-round
verdant heath.

07:43.767 --> 07:45.133
Sorry.
I'm completely listening.

07:45.133 --> 07:47.067
I just--I'm trying
to find some bars.

07:47.067 --> 07:50.800
I'm expecting an urgent call--
or 14, actually.

07:50.800 --> 07:53.700
Ah, this is good.
Okay, continue.

07:53.700 --> 07:56.967
We have unmatched maintenance
for our landscape design.

07:56.967 --> 07:59.533
Pigeons are kept at bay
by a red-tailed fox--

07:59.533 --> 08:01.267
[bluesy ringtone]

08:01.267 --> 08:03.933
Oh, sorry, this will
just take a sec.

08:03.933 --> 08:05.767
- Hello?
- Hey, Jill.

08:05.767 --> 08:07.933
He's totally fine,

08:07.933 --> 08:09.700
but Miles
broke his glasses,

08:09.700 --> 08:10.867
and now he's bawling.

08:10.867 --> 08:12.700
Oh, my God,
how did they break?

08:12.700 --> 08:14.833
Wait. Miles doesn't
even wear glasses.

08:14.833 --> 08:16.267
He doesn't?

08:16.267 --> 08:18.700
No, he's in a white T
with blue sleeves.

08:18.700 --> 08:19.900
Oh, I've been watching
the wrong kid.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.100
I see him now.

08:21.100 --> 08:22.800
He's picking his nose.
He's fine.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.533
- Thanks.
- Honey, sit down.

08:24.533 --> 08:26.233
Sorry.
Continue.

08:26.233 --> 08:28.167
So, if you were to be accepted,

08:28.167 --> 08:31.333
five available plots are here
on the grassy knoll.

08:31.333 --> 08:35.267
The other eight are across
the glen at the ocean's edge,

08:35.267 --> 08:37.533
with a view of the sunset
and the horizon.

08:37.533 --> 08:39.200
(Candace)
Magnificent.

08:39.200 --> 08:41.700
- That's exquisite.
- That would be beautiful.

08:41.700 --> 08:44.067
But we're dead, right?

08:49.767 --> 08:51.567
Come on, Vanessa,
keep pushing!

08:51.567 --> 08:53.733
- Keep pushing!
- [shouts]

08:53.733 --> 08:55.767
You're almost
at the top.

08:55.767 --> 08:58.400
You got one more step.
Come on.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.433
[Vanessa shouts]

09:00.433 --> 09:01.933
Oh, my God!

09:01.933 --> 09:03.067
I did it!

09:03.067 --> 09:04.567
Whoo-hoo!

09:07.267 --> 09:08.600
Now what?

09:08.600 --> 09:11.067
Well, you come down.

09:11.067 --> 09:12.067
Oh.

09:12.067 --> 09:13.700
So what'd I come
up here for?

09:13.700 --> 09:15.500
The experience?

09:15.500 --> 09:16.867
Oh.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.967
Pricey experience.

09:20.967 --> 09:25.333
In one scenario,
the plain Webers

09:25.333 --> 09:27.200
would rest here
on the grassy knoll,

09:27.200 --> 09:30.833
and the Von Webers,
party of eight,

09:30.833 --> 09:33.100
would be laid by the ocean.

09:33.100 --> 09:34.933
Wait.
Why would there be eight?

09:34.933 --> 09:37.900
Well, naturally,
one for my unborn granddaughter,

09:37.900 --> 09:40.167
whose name I'm not
allowed to know.

09:40.167 --> 09:42.633
Apparently,
it's a big state secret.

09:42.633 --> 09:44.700
Right, but that still leaves
one extra plot.

09:44.700 --> 09:46.733
Then it's
for my future husband,

09:46.733 --> 09:48.567
unknown as he may be
at this moment.

09:48.567 --> 09:49.600
What?

09:49.600 --> 09:51.867
Dad would be devastated
if you remarried.

09:51.867 --> 09:55.433
Your father lost his vote
the day he decided to go

09:55.433 --> 09:57.200
on the great white shark
expedition.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.267
[bluesy ringtone]

09:59.267 --> 10:00.533
(Jill)
I'm sorry.

10:00.533 --> 10:01.567
Hello?

10:01.567 --> 10:03.100
(Rima)
Okay, so...

10:03.100 --> 10:05.867
now real Miles
has a bloody nose.

10:05.867 --> 10:08.500
I wouldn't have called,
but it's like a tsunami.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.633
He bled all over BJ,
and now he's soaking.

10:10.633 --> 10:13.100
Oh, my God,
BJ's soaking?

10:13.100 --> 10:15.033
Okay, this happens sometimes.

10:15.033 --> 10:17.933
Just take a tampon,
cut it in half lengthwise,

10:17.933 --> 10:20.433
and shove it up there.

10:20.433 --> 10:21.833
I'm on my way.

10:21.833 --> 10:24.567
Would you please forgive us
for these hideous interruptions?

10:24.567 --> 10:25.967
So sorry.

10:25.967 --> 10:28.167
it's 4:30, and I didn't budget
for this colossal schlep.

10:28.167 --> 10:30.433
My kids are at a party.
There's a bloody nose.

10:30.433 --> 10:32.367
So it's really been
a pleasure.

10:32.367 --> 10:34.200
Just dump my bones
anywhere.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.333
I'm easy.
Okay. Bye-bye!

10:41.567 --> 10:43.000
I am so, so sorry.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.500
They are charging me $15
for every minute of overtime,

10:45.500 --> 10:47.267
and you are
42 minutes late.

10:47.267 --> 10:48.300
(man)
43

10:48.300 --> 10:49.867
I am going
to reimburse you.

10:49.867 --> 10:52.833
Oh, my God,
I am so mortified.

10:52.833 --> 10:55.667
Wait, how much is--
So math is not my strong suit.

10:55.667 --> 10:58.333
Okay, do you take
frozen yogurt cards?

10:58.333 --> 11:00.733
It's only one more stamp,
and then you get a free medium,

11:00.733 --> 11:02.067
two toppings.

11:02.067 --> 11:03.500
Okay, I'm gonna
give you a check.

11:03.500 --> 11:05.333
Take your kids and leave.

11:05.333 --> 11:06.300
[bluesy ringtone]

11:06.300 --> 11:07.333
Okay.
Wait, my phone!

11:07.333 --> 11:08.800
My phone!
My phone, sorry.

11:08.800 --> 11:09.967
It's a school!

11:09.967 --> 11:11.300
Oh, my God.

11:11.300 --> 11:12.600
Hello?

11:12.600 --> 11:14.967
Yes, this is she.

11:14.967 --> 11:16.400
Yes.

11:16.400 --> 11:17.500
No, that is not
your present!

11:17.500 --> 11:18.733
Sorry. Shh.

11:18.733 --> 11:21.600
- Are you kidding me?
- Terrific, thank you.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.300
Thanks.
Bye.

11:23.300 --> 11:25.500
Okay.
I am so sorry.

11:25.500 --> 11:26.500
[bluesy ringtone]

11:26.500 --> 11:27.567
Oh, my God,
another school.

11:27.567 --> 11:29.167
Sorry.
When it rains, it pours.

11:29.167 --> 11:30.567
Hello?

11:30.567 --> 11:34.267
Yes, wonderful.
Thank you so much.

11:34.267 --> 11:35.433
Bye-bye.

11:35.433 --> 11:36.733
I'm so sorry.

11:36.733 --> 11:37.767
Just go.

11:37.767 --> 11:40.233
Okay, guys.
Oh, my God, you poor thing.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.900
Okay, bye.
Thanks so much for having us.

11:42.900 --> 11:44.100
Say thanks.

11:44.100 --> 11:45.400
Okay, bye.

11:48.933 --> 11:51.133
Babe!
All 14 schools called.

11:51.133 --> 11:52.767
At the same time,
but still,

11:52.767 --> 11:54.300
all of our
interviews are set.

11:54.300 --> 11:57.067
I can finally rejoin
normal civilization.

11:59.067 --> 12:00.067
What?

12:02.333 --> 12:04.100
You're kidding.

12:04.100 --> 12:06.500
But we were talking coffin
locations and everything.

12:06.500 --> 12:08.267
Did they say why?

12:08.267 --> 12:11.867
Well, I don't want
to point any fingers, but...

12:11.867 --> 12:13.267
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

12:13.267 --> 12:16.867
You literally crazied
our family out of a grave.

12:16.867 --> 12:18.600
And I know you don't care,

12:18.600 --> 12:20.800
but I had to listen
to my mother go on

12:20.800 --> 12:23.933
and on and on about how--
"No, just roll her up

12:23.933 --> 12:27.067
in a Persian rug and dump her
over the side of a ship."

12:27.067 --> 12:28.667
Babe, I'm so sorry.

12:28.667 --> 12:31.300
I really am.

12:31.300 --> 12:34.200
Are you okay?

12:34.200 --> 12:36.233
I'm just frustrated
about other things.

12:36.233 --> 12:38.433
I mean, I finally
make partner, and I think,

12:38.433 --> 12:40.767
"Oh, it's gonna be this great,
life-changing thing."

12:40.767 --> 12:41.800
And for what?

12:41.800 --> 12:43.100
So I can work even harder,

12:43.100 --> 12:44.467
see you guys even less,

12:44.467 --> 12:47.267
till we're all dead,
lying on the grassy knoll,

12:47.267 --> 12:49.767
not looking over the ocean.

12:49.767 --> 12:52.633
Except we're not gonna be
in the grassy knoll, right?

12:52.633 --> 12:54.733
'Cause we got rejected.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.633
Well, wherever we end up,

12:56.633 --> 12:58.900
probably that cemetery
over by JFK,

12:58.900 --> 13:00.467
we'll be dead.

13:00.467 --> 13:02.500
I will have written
a lot of legal briefs,

13:02.500 --> 13:03.900
the end.

13:03.900 --> 13:06.233
Okay, you're under a lot
of pressure right now,

13:06.233 --> 13:09.267
but I am going to fix this
Greenacres Park thing, okay?

13:09.267 --> 13:10.267
Hand to God.

13:10.267 --> 13:11.600
No, put your hand down.

13:11.600 --> 13:12.967
Do not do anything else.

13:12.967 --> 13:14.600
Please.

13:14.600 --> 13:16.667
Sure.

[gasps]

13:26.333 --> 13:27.733
See this?

13:27.733 --> 13:29.900
Took me two hours to make.

13:29.900 --> 13:32.133
I don't think
cooking's my hobby.

13:32.133 --> 13:33.867
Still, impressed.

13:33.867 --> 13:36.167
Okay, so I know
you hate death,

13:36.167 --> 13:38.633
so I'm going to come with you
to that wake tomorrow.

13:38.633 --> 13:39.700
I don't hate death.

13:39.700 --> 13:41.067
I deal with it every day.

13:41.067 --> 13:42.200
Okay, fine!

13:42.200 --> 13:43.600
I screwed up
the cemetery thing,

13:43.600 --> 13:45.333
and now I have to gargle
this old guy's balls

13:45.333 --> 13:46.367
to change his mind.

13:46.367 --> 13:47.900
[gargling]

13:47.900 --> 13:49.433
Exactly.

13:49.433 --> 13:51.633
I can't give Andy's family
one more reason to hate me.

13:51.633 --> 13:53.833
Yeah, they really
don't like you.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.133
It's a shame.

13:55.133 --> 13:59.300
Anyway, I discovered,
thanks to dateanundertaker.com,

13:59.300 --> 14:01.200
that Cornelius Hollingsworth III

is a founding member of
the Three Chocolatiers--yum--

14:04.400 --> 14:07.767
and also is really into bridge
and Japanese koi.

are you going to do,

with a tank of fish?

14:13.500 --> 14:14.833
That's pretty good.

14:14.833 --> 14:17.167
Do you still have that friend
with the pickup truck?

14:17.167 --> 14:18.833
Really, the nicest thing
you could do for the guy

14:18.833 --> 14:21.733
would be to get him
new hobbies.

has a pier, right?

actually work, Lex.

wearing shoes today.

no Chipotles in Mexico?

where a Mexican

can't get an ecologically
sustainable burrito, do you?

just adored you.

was a wonderful man.

He was
a world-class prick.

15:46.300 --> 15:48.233
He missed both my weddings
for golf tournaments

15:48.233 --> 15:50.867
and stopped speaking to me
'cause I married a black woman.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.833

So many questions.

was a bitch.

I am so sorry for my behavior.

16:28.533 --> 16:30.067
I'd hate
for my husband's family

16:30.067 --> 16:31.633
to be eternally punished.

16:31.633 --> 16:33.067
I appreciate
the sentiment.

into consideration.

to Yale too?

to leave you

what I think it is?

16:47.300 --> 16:49.267
You love
Varsano's chocolates too?

16:49.267 --> 16:52.367
I didn't know if you were
a milk or dark person.

16:52.367 --> 16:54.200
The squares
are marshmallow.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.267
Prepare to die.

16:56.267 --> 17:00.100
Mrs. Weber, Greenacres Park
does not look kindly on bribes,

17:00.100 --> 17:01.700
and neither do I.

17:01.700 --> 17:03.767
Bribes?
What?

17:03.767 --> 17:08.067
No, these aren't
even for you.

17:08.067 --> 17:11.267
They're for
Mr. Cardiff's widow.

17:11.267 --> 17:14.533
Then why is there an "H"
in a heart?

17:14.533 --> 17:17.700
Because they're
for Helen.

17:17.700 --> 17:19.800
Her name is Ruth.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.467
Might I remind you
that this is a wake?

17:21.467 --> 17:22.900
A man has died.

17:22.900 --> 17:26.533
His loved ones are here
to pay their respects.

17:26.533 --> 17:27.667
I'll take those.

17:27.667 --> 17:28.700
No!

17:28.700 --> 17:30.533
They're for Helen!

17:30.533 --> 17:32.333
What are you--

17:32.333 --> 17:33.433
[Vanessa gasps]

17:33.433 --> 17:34.733
Oh, my God.

17:36.767 --> 17:37.767
We should go.

17:37.767 --> 17:39.267
Yeah, this is bad.

17:47.933 --> 17:49.467
[men singing a cappella]

17:49.467 --> 17:52.167
* Doo-wah *

17:52.167 --> 17:53.367
* Doo-doo *

17:53.367 --> 17:56.700
What sheer bliss is this?

17:56.700 --> 18:00.500
I'm instantly transported
back to my days at Yale.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.333
Is this because of my op-ed

18:02.333 --> 18:04.767
protesting a cappella cutbacks
in the Ivy League?

18:04.767 --> 18:06.767
[singing continues]

18:06.767 --> 18:08.833
* Broadway *

18:08.833 --> 18:09.900
You!

18:09.900 --> 18:12.233
* Oh, Broadway *

18:12.233 --> 18:13.967
- I'm calling security.
- No, wait, please.

18:13.967 --> 18:16.067
I just wanted
to apologize again,

18:16.067 --> 18:19.933
with the help of your former
singing group from Yale.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.600
A-one, two, three, four.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.700
* Give my regards
to Broadway *

18:24.700 --> 18:28.067
* Remember me
to Herald Square *

18:28.067 --> 18:31.267
* Tell all the gang
at 42nd Street *

18:31.267 --> 18:33.433
* That I'll soon be there *

18:33.433 --> 18:36.067
Stop, stop, stop singing.
I've heard enough.

18:36.067 --> 18:37.667
I'll ask you
for the last time

18:37.667 --> 18:40.200
to leave my grounds
immediately.

18:40.200 --> 18:41.833
Totally not
your fault, guys.

18:41.833 --> 18:43.067
All me.

18:43.067 --> 18:44.367
(man)
Catch you later, Jill.

18:44.367 --> 18:46.267
Sorry.

18:46.267 --> 18:50.667
Mrs. Weber, I am not
finished with you.

18:50.667 --> 18:53.167
The second soprano
of my a cappella group,

18:53.167 --> 18:55.400
the Brazen Overtures,
is having her hip replaced,

18:55.400 --> 18:57.367
and we have four events
coming up.

18:57.367 --> 18:58.667
Does this mean--

18:58.667 --> 19:01.267
Show up tomorrow night,
7:00 to 9:00,

19:01.267 --> 19:02.767
for rehearsal at La Mama.

19:02.767 --> 19:04.733
I'll be there.
Thank you!

19:09.400 --> 19:11.167
I can't believe
you got us in.

19:11.167 --> 19:13.567
I don't even want to know
how you managed to pull it off,

19:13.567 --> 19:14.733
but thank you.

19:14.733 --> 19:15.967
It was nothing.

19:15.967 --> 19:17.600
And I've been thinking.

19:17.600 --> 19:20.267
If this partner thing isn't
all it's cracked up to be,

19:20.267 --> 19:22.133
let's talk
about your next move.

19:22.133 --> 19:24.933
Well, Lex offered me
a job at Hercules.

19:24.933 --> 19:26.433
[chuckles]

19:26.433 --> 19:29.100
Over my dead body...

19:29.100 --> 19:31.067
which reminds me,

19:31.067 --> 19:34.167
if I land
at the grassy knoll first,

19:34.167 --> 19:37.567
I want you to remarry
and be happy.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.433
We're not having
this conversation.

19:39.433 --> 19:40.767
What about Lolly McTamany?

19:40.767 --> 19:42.400
You're fixing me up now?

19:42.400 --> 19:44.433
I like having my ducks
in a row.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.133
- Harlow Kincaid?
- No.

19:46.133 --> 19:47.733
Alexis Hilton?

19:47.733 --> 19:49.067
Now, she's cute.

19:49.067 --> 19:50.333
Okay.

19:50.333 --> 19:52.100
Alexis Hilton, it is.

19:52.100 --> 19:54.600
Good night, sweetheart.

19:54.600 --> 19:57.400
I mean, I didn't know
she was your type.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.267
I hear she's difficult.

19:59.267 --> 20:02.200
Well, then she's
definitely my type.

20:02.200 --> 20:03.267
I love you.

20:03.267 --> 20:04.500
Love you.

20:04.500 --> 20:05.867
(man on TV)
It was really rough...

20:05.867 --> 20:08.367
[cell phone ringing]

20:08.367 --> 20:10.467
You will not believe this.

20:10.467 --> 20:12.233
I'm watching
some new reality show

20:12.233 --> 20:14.733
where they pair homeless
people with life coaches.

20:14.733 --> 20:17.033
I have so much TV
to catch up on.

20:17.033 --> 20:19.333
You know, I tried
cultivating my passions,

20:19.333 --> 20:20.567
but then I realized,

20:20.567 --> 20:23.933
I might be too lazy
for kids or hobbies.

20:23.933 --> 20:26.367
May I remind you that
my father-in-law's hobby

20:26.367 --> 20:27.733
was swimming
with great white sharks

20:27.733 --> 20:29.267
until one digested him.

20:29.267 --> 20:30.833
[snickers]

20:30.833 --> 20:32.033
You always say
the right thing.

20:32.033 --> 20:34.233
- Love you.
- I love you.

20:34.233 --> 20:38.567
(woman on TV)
Okay, I want you to picture
yourself 12 months from now.

20:38.567 --> 20:41.567
What are two things you'd like
to have more of in your life?

20:41.567 --> 20:43.233
(man on TV)
Heroin and pussy.

20:43.233 --> 20:44.700
Ugh.

20:44.700 --> 20:47.467
[blows tuning whistle]

20:47.467 --> 20:50.267
A-one and a-two
and a-one, two, three.

20:50.267 --> 20:52.867
(all)
* By the light *

20:52.867 --> 20:54.733
* Of the silvery moon *

20:54.733 --> 20:56.567
* Not the sun,
but the moon *

20:56.567 --> 20:58.400
* I want to spoon *

20:58.400 --> 21:00.200
* Not a fork, but a spoon *

21:00.200 --> 21:04.533
* To my honey,
I'll croon love's tune *

21:04.533 --> 21:05.600
* Honeymoon *

21:05.600 --> 21:07.100
* Have a honey honeymoon *

21:07.100 --> 21:09.067
* Keep it shining in June *

21:09.067 --> 21:10.567
* Not May, but June *

21:10.567 --> 21:14.167
* Your silvery beams
will be love's dreams *

21:14.167 --> 21:17.467
* We'll be cuddling soon *

21:17.467 --> 21:22.067
* By the silvery moon *

21:22.067 --> 21:25.067

21:26.067 --> 21:27.067
(girl)
Oh, dear.
