09:10.607 --> 09:12.552
Okay, I think we can
still salvage...

09:12.646 --> 09:13.974
What the hell?!

09:14.079 --> 09:15.912
(tires screeching)

09:17.591 --> 09:18.873
He stopped.

09:18.927 --> 09:20.662
Don't worry.
W-We're safe up here.

09:20.768 --> 09:22.262
(tires screeching)

09:25.572 --> 09:27.060
Maybe he just wants to talk.

09:27.158 --> 09:29.478
We were just doing
a little prank-a-roo.

09:29.789 --> 09:30.854
(tires screech)

09:31.740 --> 09:32.950
Oh, my God!

09:33.075 --> 09:34.375
I'm okay!

09:34.465 --> 09:35.989
A hawk got me.

09:36.739 --> 09:38.895
To Mount Darkmore!

09:38.989 --> 09:41.036
With the power
of the Dunsmere Crystal,

09:41.113 --> 09:44.809
I can finally defeat
Lord Azamaar!

09:45.536 --> 09:50.957
(weakly) Now is your time
to feel fear, Azamaar.

09:51.317 --> 09:52.399
(tires squeal in distance)

09:52.470 --> 09:53.694
(all screaming)

09:57.466 --> 09:59.436
<i>Maybe the C.I.A.
could put me into, like,</i>

09:59.489 --> 10:01.264
<i>a super-strong cyborg</i>

10:01.333 --> 10:03.807
<i>with both male and female
genitalia.</i>

10:03.880 --> 10:05.942
Oh,
or that crank flashlight-radio

10:06.008 --> 10:07.919
in the disaster kit
under the garage sink!

10:08.020 --> 10:09.218
You'd go great in that.

10:09.439 --> 10:11.379
(brakes squeak)

10:12.614 --> 10:13.755
(swipe!)

10:13.904 --> 10:16.583
That man just stole
that lady's Zagnut Bar!

10:16.687 --> 10:18.708
Is anyone gonna stop him?
Anyone?

10:18.780 --> 10:20.817
Sir, you're the only one here.

10:20.922 --> 10:22.152
Uh, you're here, too, ma'am.

10:22.266 --> 10:23.636
I don't see you playing hero.

10:25.145 --> 10:27.849
Klaus, give me back the control.
What are you doing?!

10:29.364 --> 10:31.739
Whoa, nice.

10:33.349 --> 10:36.544
Now that's what I call
sweet justice.

10:36.672 --> 10:38.763
Thank you, sir.

10:39.872 --> 10:42.474
That's how you hold on
to a candy bar.

10:43.552 --> 10:45.645
Klaus, you were incredible
back there!

10:45.766 --> 10:47.996
Navi-Joe was wrong to
stop me from hitting people.

10:48.050 --> 10:49.091
I see that now.

10:49.184 --> 10:52.591
<i>So can I keep being your car?</i>

10:52.688 --> 10:54.457
Only if you're willing
to be a vigilante

10:54.528 --> 10:55.654
and fight local crime with me.

10:55.678 --> 10:56.747
<i>I'm in.</i>

10:56.773 --> 10:58.911
<i>Let's keep
the streets of Langley safe.</i>

10:59.061 --> 11:01.450
Uh, I think we already
cleaned up this town.

11:01.653 --> 11:03.893
I'm talking about
the wrong side of the tracks.

11:03.981 --> 11:07.294
<i>The embattled, war-torn streets
of East Chimdale.</i>

11:07.402 --> 11:09.862
Whoa, take it easy.
I was talking about Lanceton.

11:09.958 --> 11:12.411
I'll got to East Chimdale
when I want a bunch of rats

11:12.474 --> 11:15.708
to chew my dick off in an
abandoned baseball card store.

11:17.060 --> 11:18.653
<i>We're here, Stan.</i>

11:18.974 --> 11:21.841
<i>Wow, this place looks rough.</i>

11:22.614 --> 11:25.153
<i>Stan?
Are you asleep?</i>

11:27.661 --> 11:29.778
Stay alert, Klaus.
We're here.

11:29.847 --> 11:31.599
Stop that thief!

11:31.825 --> 11:33.935
Looks like it's "go" time.

11:36.898 --> 11:39.177
<i>Stan, take the wheel
so I can bash him repeatedly</i>

11:39.202 --> 11:40.231
<i>with my tailgate!</i>

11:40.302 --> 11:41.419
Cool, but just be careful.

11:41.450 --> 11:43.403
I got a bunch of loose
golf balls back there,

11:43.499 --> 11:44.926
and I don't want to lose them.

11:46.828 --> 11:47.995
Damn it, Klaus!

11:48.263 --> 11:49.645
At least close the door

11:49.716 --> 11:51.192
before I lose
my loose coat hangers.

11:51.279 --> 11:52.708
I know how many are back there.

11:52.867 --> 11:53.867
(horn honks in distance)

11:57.903 --> 11:59.474
Hey, you got to pay for those!

11:59.588 --> 12:00.888
We got this, Manny.

12:01.123 --> 12:03.323
Aah!

12:05.247 --> 12:07.296
It was just a little prank!

12:09.670 --> 12:11.035
<i>Who the hell was that?!</i>

12:11.070 --> 12:12.094
How should I know?

12:12.129 --> 12:13.449
You think I know
everyone in town?

12:13.605 --> 12:15.262
Hey, do you know
Mark from Germany?

12:15.351 --> 12:16.812
Just drive.

12:17.742 --> 12:20.469
<i>Stan, you ever wonder why
everyone's stealing Zagnuts?</i>

12:20.575 --> 12:23.992
What I've been wondering
is when did you get so cool?

12:24.107 --> 12:25.672
I'm having a hell
of a time with you!

12:25.781 --> 12:27.984
<i>I feel the same way, Stan.</i>

12:28.116 --> 12:29.758
<i>Oh, we're here.</i>

12:32.437 --> 12:33.687
I think we killed this guy.

12:33.851 --> 12:35.187
(weakly)
I'm still alive.

12:35.402 --> 12:36.940
<i>Should we finish him off?</i>

12:36.996 --> 12:40.172
Now, now, Klaus,
it's not our place to play God.

12:46.211 --> 12:48.672
I think...
I-I-I think we lost him.

12:48.804 --> 12:51.000
(engine revs)

12:51.117 --> 12:52.226
Just do it!

12:52.251 --> 12:53.358
(screaming)

12:53.383 --> 12:54.942
Just finish us.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.609
Aaah!

12:56.687 --> 12:59.367
I mean, there was a time
when a man could take out

12:59.441 --> 13:02.244
his lady and her kids
and simply have a nice night.

13:02.390 --> 13:04.156
Has the whole world gone crazy?!

13:04.252 --> 13:05.982
They're children, Frank!

13:06.086 --> 13:08.987
And do you know what children
turn into, Stacey?

13:09.078 --> 13:10.290
Adults.

13:10.367 --> 13:11.500
Well, not this time!

13:11.570 --> 13:12.856
Frank, look at me.

13:13.094 --> 13:14.305
Please, Frank.

13:14.383 --> 13:17.109
Do you remember Montauk?
Do you remember the ferry?!

13:17.234 --> 13:19.054
It looked full and we
didn't think we could fit,

13:19.078 --> 13:20.226
but then what happened?

13:20.280 --> 13:21.750
Look at me, Frank!

13:22.711 --> 13:25.482
All those people moved
their cars up just a few inches,

13:25.531 --> 13:28.289
just a few inches to let us on.

13:28.522 --> 13:29.909
They helped us.

13:30.195 --> 13:33.039
Yes. Adults helped us.

13:33.195 --> 13:35.180
Do you remember that, Frank?

13:36.734 --> 13:38.181
Those were good adults.

13:38.328 --> 13:39.648
(voice breaking)
Stacey.

13:39.719 --> 13:40.831
(voice breaking)
Yes, Frank?

13:40.856 --> 13:43.015
Do you think there's
any chance for us

13:43.633 --> 13:46.078
to still have a nice night?

13:46.461 --> 13:48.424
(both sobbing)

13:55.555 --> 13:56.766
(sighs)

13:56.899 --> 13:58.634
Who was that?!

13:58.751 --> 14:01.032
(insects chirping)

14:01.126 --> 14:03.854
You're right, Klaus.
They are dazzling.

14:04.009 --> 14:06.735
<i>Yeah, when I saw these stars
a while ago,</i>

14:06.805 --> 14:09.917
<i>I was like,
"Stan will go nuts for these."</i>

14:10.032 --> 14:11.652
You know, before today,

14:11.868 --> 14:14.722
I only had like one Zagnut
my entire life.

14:14.766 --> 14:15.821
Maybe none.

14:15.889 --> 14:17.949
<i>Really?
You never told me that.</i>

14:18.059 --> 14:19.636
I've never told anybody that.

14:19.790 --> 14:22.688
Now you know more about me
than anyone in the world.

14:22.764 --> 14:26.264
<i>(gasps) Would you say
that you trust me completely?</i>

14:26.462 --> 14:29.168
<i>That I have your heart
in my hands?</i>

14:29.227 --> 14:31.727
That's exactly what
I'd say, amigo.

14:31.840 --> 14:33.954
<i>Then I will take your heart</i>

14:34.063 --> 14:36.805
<i>and bash it with my tailgate!</i>

14:38.540 --> 14:39.790
Klaus, what the hell?!

14:39.877 --> 14:42.277
<i>You were going to
let me die, Stan!</i>

14:42.350 --> 14:44.602
You can't leave me out here
in the middle of nowhere.

14:44.696 --> 14:45.985
This is cougar country!

14:46.065 --> 14:48.743
<i>Don't worry, there's
a 1% chance you survive.</i>

14:48.891 --> 14:53.126
<i>And those are great odds
for a Powerball man!</i>

14:54.095 --> 14:57.035
Have you been writing down
everything I say?!

14:59.769 --> 15:02.050
<i>Celebrate your revenge, Klaus.</i>

15:02.260 --> 15:04.933
<i>Celebrate with every ounce
of your being!</i>

15:05.206 --> 15:07.730
<i>(howling)</i>

15:07.933 --> 15:09.175
<i>(laughs)</i>

15:10.214 --> 15:13.417
<i>Ooh, look who heard
my wolf howl.</i>

15:14.355 --> 15:17.167
<i>Hey, baby, today's your lucky...</i>

15:17.425 --> 15:19.566
<i>Aw, man, hidden dudes?</i>

15:19.683 --> 15:22.011
<i>At least tell me you're
all going to the same place.</i>

15:22.090 --> 15:24.910
Yeah. We're all going
to the same place.

15:24.949 --> 15:25.925
(gun cocks)

15:25.972 --> 15:26.995
<i>(gasps)</i>

15:27.050 --> 15:28.660
We're bringing in the truck.

15:28.808 --> 15:31.130
Take us to Zagnut Gulch.

15:32.581 --> 15:35.738
Looks like Klaus
is headed to Zagnut Gulch.

15:43.269 --> 15:44.770
(breathes deeply)

15:45.253 --> 15:47.348
Hey, Gang,
got a question for you.

15:47.488 --> 15:50.667
Isn't this nice?
What a nice night we're having.

15:52.000 --> 15:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here

16:00.456 --> 16:02.558
It's okay, champ.

16:05.834 --> 16:08.264
Sorry, could I bother you
for another fork?

16:08.347 --> 16:10.802
We... We got a little case
of the butterfingers here.

16:10.874 --> 16:12.255
It's not a big deal.

16:12.404 --> 16:14.286
Of course not, why would it be?

16:14.458 --> 16:16.404
Get the fork.

16:20.505 --> 16:23.888
(sighs)
Okay, let's dig in!

16:25.419 --> 16:26.646
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

16:26.740 --> 16:27.953
I thought we were back on track.

16:27.977 --> 16:28.736
What's the problem?

16:28.761 --> 16:31.107
- It's nothing. It's just...
- Just what?

16:31.349 --> 16:33.474
I asked for red sauce,
and they gave me white sauce.

16:33.561 --> 16:34.691
I got this.

16:34.755 --> 16:36.763
It's fine.
I'll just eat it.

16:36.898 --> 16:40.122
I can do this.
Montauk.

16:42.928 --> 16:44.630
Hey, really quick, guys...

16:44.708 --> 16:47.091
my lady ordered red sauce,
and you gave her white sauce.

16:47.147 --> 16:48.974
Sorry, buddy,
we're out of red sauce.

16:49.068 --> 16:50.082

<i>Hey, Knock, I'm Klaus.
I'm a car.</i>

17:29.417 --> 17:31.687
You're a problem is what
you are... A big one.

17:31.789 --> 17:34.421
'Cause we steal cars
and Zagnut bars.

17:34.586 --> 17:37.352
And you been shutting down
half our operation!

17:37.571 --> 17:38.768
Got his LoJack.

17:38.828 --> 17:40.123
Great job, Cindy.

17:40.211 --> 17:42.000
You just earned yourself
a Zagnut bar.

17:42.067 --> 17:43.933
Thanks, but I'm not
really in the mood.

17:44.055 --> 17:45.703
I've already had like two today.

17:45.805 --> 17:47.469
Oh, oh, no problem.

17:47.494 --> 17:48.636
You're just out of the gang.

17:48.661 --> 17:49.696
Oh, come on, Knock...

17:49.733 --> 17:51.003
No (bleep) you, Cindy.

17:54.742 --> 17:57.076
Dear God,
they're stripping the car!

17:57.539 --> 17:59.746
Ooh, that's nice.

17:59.914 --> 18:01.555
But am I young and cool enough

18:01.618 --> 18:04.816
or old and uncool enough
to wear a leather jacket?

18:06.621 --> 18:08.031
<i>Ow! That's my seat!</i>

18:08.115 --> 18:10.031
<i>Please, no, not the doors!</i>

18:10.172 --> 18:11.516
<i>I beg of you, stop!</i>

18:11.594 --> 18:12.875
How about letting
one of the boys

18:12.922 --> 18:14.946
from the front office
do some chopping?

18:15.946 --> 18:18.060
Excuse me. Pardon me.

18:18.156 --> 18:19.333
Sick boots.

18:19.391 --> 18:20.742
What do you got there,
the gas cap?

18:20.766 --> 18:22.071
Cool score, dude.

18:22.137 --> 18:24.071
Hope you bad boys left me
the steering wheel.

18:24.164 --> 18:25.398
I'm looking forward
to chopping that.

18:25.422 --> 18:26.422

18:26.492 --> 18:27.524
Chop, chop, chop.

Klaus?

18:34.406 --> 18:36.250
Goddamn it, fish!

18:38.803 --> 18:40.436
You've been a great car.

18:40.600 --> 18:42.389
Navi-Joe loved you.

18:42.615 --> 18:45.475
And I guess, in a way, so did I.

18:45.795 --> 18:48.154
But now I've got to
save my friend.

19:00.475 --> 19:02.615
(gunshots)

19:02.763 --> 19:04.147
Klaus!

19:04.325 --> 19:05.904
Hope you're still
in there, buddy.

19:05.998 --> 19:08.010

19:12.044 --> 19:13.583
Style points.

19:14.593 --> 19:15.740
My friend's in here.

19:15.818 --> 19:17.255
I need you to get it
working again.

19:17.280 --> 19:18.599
I don't care what experimental,

19:18.649 --> 19:21.248
morally questionable
technology you use, just do it.

19:21.333 --> 19:22.623
I could try a car battery.

19:22.658 --> 19:24.498
Don't talk to me about
your dark arts!

19:24.538 --> 19:26.279
Just bring him back!

19:27.443 --> 19:29.562
(device beeps, warbling)
Klaus?

19:29.693 --> 19:31.326
<i>Announcer ♪1:
Traffic on the fives.</i>

19:31.506 --> 19:35.375
<i>MAN: ♪ El perro, el perro
es mi corazon, el... ♪</i>

19:35.488 --> 19:38.042
<i>Announcer ♪2: Here's the pitch.
Low and inside.</i>

19:38.146 --> 19:41.956
<i>Cher: ♪ Do you believe in life
after love? ♪</i>

19:42.277 --> 19:43.753
He's gone.

19:44.136 --> 19:47.753
<i>Cher and Klaus: ♪ I can feel
something inside me say ♪</i>

19:47.855 --> 19:50.761
Klaus, I...
I thought I lost you.

19:50.949 --> 19:53.230
<i>Klaus: Stan? Why are you in
heaven with me and Cher?</i>

19:53.386 --> 19:54.861
<i>Wait, this isn't...</i>

19:55.050 --> 19:57.592
<i>Where are we?
Where's your car?</i>

19:57.746 --> 19:59.175
I crashed it into the cave.

19:59.285 --> 20:01.503
- <i>Why?</i>
- To save you, Klaus!

20:01.603 --> 20:05.105
<i>I knew that, Stan. I just
wanted to hear you say it.</i>

20:05.193 --> 20:06.883
<i>Now can you get me
out of this thing?</i>

20:06.941 --> 20:09.581
<i>I think I've learned
everything I can as a car.</i>

20:09.730 --> 20:12.394
Well, I did just get a new
shipment of lab animals in.

20:12.493 --> 20:13.823
Take your pick.

20:13.915 --> 20:15.527
They're arranged
from left to right,

20:15.628 --> 20:17.644
from fastest to fiercest.

20:18.901 --> 20:20.492
How about the fish over there?

20:20.933 --> 20:22.339
That's <i> my</i> fish.

20:22.464 --> 20:24.855
No, that's my <i> friend.</i>

20:24.959 --> 20:28.199
<i>You know, the snake looks like
he could be a cool customer.</i>

20:28.258 --> 20:29.684
You're going in the fish.

20:30.003 --> 20:32.081
Steve, wake up.

20:32.267 --> 20:33.621
Aaaaaaah!

20:33.768 --> 20:36.050
Oh, settle down.
I just shot a skull cap

20:36.089 --> 20:37.875
full of hamburger meat
and calamari.

20:37.956 --> 20:39.871
The important thing is
Frank's dead

20:39.988 --> 20:43.121
and Stacey and the kids are
starting a brand-new chapter.

20:43.253 --> 20:44.366
Who's Frank?

20:44.445 --> 20:46.355
He was essentially a cop.

20:46.496 --> 20:48.023
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:48.047 --> 20:50.253
God. You know,
I put a lot of effort

20:50.308 --> 20:52.881
into showing you what
a real prank looks like, Steve.

20:52.949 --> 20:55.566
Wait, w-w-w-was that you
trying to kill us?!

20:55.699 --> 20:56.986
Yeah, it was funny!

20:57.121 --> 20:59.574
Hey, if you're going to
the hospital to visit Barry,

20:59.683 --> 21:01.956
tell him I said, "Gotcha."

21:02.284 --> 21:04.244
Bye! Have a beautiful time!
