Hey. You know what I just realized?

00:26.359 --> 00:27.627
With my arrest last night,

00:27.694 --> 00:32.332
I have now been incarcerated
in five consecutive decades.

00:33.133 --> 00:33.800
Wow.

00:36.102 --> 00:37.270
Good for you, Mom.

00:37.337 --> 00:40.306
You're the Minnie Minoso of marijuana.

00:42.108 --> 00:43.243
I don't know who that is.

00:44.711 --> 00:47.247
Yes, you do. Minnie Minoso?

00:47.680 --> 00:48.815
You know.

00:49.449 --> 00:50.550
Google him.

00:51.451 --> 00:52.485
No, just tell me.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.621
Google him. It's so worth it.

00:56.623 --> 00:58.191
Minnie, like the mouse.

00:58.525 --> 01:00.660
-M-I-N--
-I know how to spell "Minnie."

01:01.461 --> 01:02.462
Minoso.

01:02.529 --> 01:04.631
M-I-N-O-S-O?

01:04.697 --> 01:06.199
Yes. Now "return."

01:10.737 --> 01:14.774
Okay, so your mom is the first
black player on the Chicago White Sox?

01:15.475 --> 01:16.609
[laughing]

01:18.278 --> 01:19.846
No. Try "Minnie Minoso decades."

01:20.113 --> 01:20.847
Just tell me.

01:21.114 --> 01:22.515
No, but you're so close.

01:22.582 --> 01:25.084
Travis, I swear,
I will punch you right in the tits.

01:25.318 --> 01:27.754
That's why I love you, Olivia.
You're a quick study.

01:28.588 --> 01:29.522
Fine.

01:29.589 --> 01:33.793
Minnie Minoso was the first man
to play professional baseball

01:33.860 --> 01:35.762
in five different decades.

01:36.663 --> 01:37.530
Okay.

01:38.364 --> 01:39.599
So, why was this worth it?

01:40.266 --> 01:42.368
Don't you see?
In the same way Minnie Minoso--

01:42.435 --> 01:46.339
Shut the fuck up
about Minnie-fucking-Minoso.

01:51.177 --> 01:52.412
Someone had to say it.

01:55.281 --> 01:56.182
No, no.

01:56.249 --> 01:57.684
Keep the window shut.

01:57.750 --> 01:59.519
Otherwise, we're-- We're too exposed.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.488
Too exposed to what?

02:05.658 --> 02:06.526
Oh. [stammers]

02:06.826 --> 02:08.161
Sorry. I thought I was--

02:10.330 --> 02:11.197
Never mind.

-Right on.
-Yeah.

02:37.924 --> 02:40.393
Thanks. All right. Gotcha.

02:41.895 --> 02:45.198
Jeez, Travis, what's going on?
I've been getting fisted all morning.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.402
Well, you can thank Dank and Dabby
for that.

02:49.469 --> 02:51.771
They're the reason
we have all these new customers.

02:51.838 --> 02:54.207
But they remind me
of a bunch of Chewbaccas.

02:55.642 --> 02:56.910
I don't think that's true.

02:57.710 --> 02:59.445
[yawning]

03:04.250 --> 03:05.618
Where is she? You.

03:06.185 --> 03:07.854
Whoa. Oh. Not today, bro.

03:07.921 --> 03:10.757
-That--
-Carter, no. It's fine.

03:12.358 --> 03:13.326
Copy.

03:16.729 --> 03:19.766
Tae Kwon Doug, sorry about your wrist.

03:19.832 --> 03:21.568
Yeah, well, I got two, asshole.

03:23.202 --> 03:26.639
Wow. Did you get that, Carter?
Guy's got two assholes.

03:29.509 --> 03:31.244
Ruth, I am here for one reason.

03:31.311 --> 03:32.612
To tell you two things:

03:33.246 --> 03:36.549
A, that I am strongly considering
pressing assault charges.

03:36.616 --> 03:37.817
-Really?
-Yeah.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.553
You want everyone to know
that a martial arts instructor

03:40.620 --> 03:43.356
got his ass beat
by a stoned old Jewish lady?

03:49.629 --> 03:52.699
And three, when I walked out of here
yesterday,

03:52.765 --> 03:55.001
I said, "You gotta chill out, Doug-o.

03:55.501 --> 04:00.240
There's no need to lose your kuk gi
over a few losers snorfing some derbs."

04:01.975 --> 04:04.377
So, I decided
I was just gonna let it slide.

04:04.444 --> 04:05.979
I was gonna be the bigger man.

04:06.579 --> 04:09.649
But then last night happened
and you turned me small.

04:09.949 --> 04:11.251
Real small.

04:11.951 --> 04:13.386
So, you watch out, Ruth.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.922
'Cause a tiny little man
is coming after you.

04:17.390 --> 04:18.558
Coming after all of you!

04:19.024 --> 04:20.726
[all booing]

04:21.961 --> 04:24.831
Oh, yeah, your "boos"
only make me smaller.

04:27.300 --> 04:29.602
-Boo.
-Yeah, see? He gets it.

04:30.703 --> 04:31.738
She.

04:34.741 --> 04:35.608
Horseshit.

04:46.386 --> 04:47.654
[woman speaking in Mandarin]
Dear Mei Mei.

04:48.354 --> 04:51.758
We know you're working hard
in medical school,

04:52.392 --> 04:57.363
so we're sending this
to help you through.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.366
Mom and Dad.

05:09.942 --> 05:11.344
Water filters.

05:12.745 --> 05:13.980
How did they know?

05:16.449 --> 05:20.019
[singing in Mandarin]
These Brita water filters hearken back

05:20.687 --> 05:25.058
To my parents' esteem

05:25.892 --> 05:29.395
My liquid safety

05:29.996 --> 05:33.633
Is of their utmost importance

05:34.567 --> 05:41.574
But they are deceived
With regard to my activities

05:43.910 --> 05:50.917
Perhaps I deserve the water-borne diseases
For which [TRANSLATION UNCLEAR]

05:53.086 --> 05:59.058
Why do I lie?

06:00.059 --> 06:07.066
Regarding my medical school instruction

06:08.434 --> 06:15.441
At the University of California,
Los Angeles?

06:27.620 --> 06:31.057
Say, it's time for my favorite dance team,
so let's look.

06:34.160 --> 06:37.697
A box of matches and an eighth
of Romulan Green marijuana.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.899
That's all you need, my friend.

06:39.966 --> 06:44.637
And soon you'll be enjoying the smoothest,
mildest, tastiest bud ever created.

06:45.071 --> 06:49.609
Every Romulan Green cigarette
is hand-rolled for maximum smokeability

06:49.675 --> 06:54.080
so, that all that sweet, cannabis goodness
goes straight to your neuroreceptors

06:54.180 --> 06:57.416
for that one-of-a-kind
Romulan Green experience.

07:03.689 --> 07:05.525
Gee, I'd like to fuck those two.

07:12.532 --> 07:15.501
With my mom's hot prison action
last night, we never got to talk

07:15.568 --> 07:19.772
-about what happened at my place.
-Yeah, I've been thinking,

07:20.206 --> 07:22.909
it's probably for the best
that we stopped when we did.

07:22.975 --> 07:24.811
Oh. Okay.

07:25.711 --> 07:26.779
Can I ask why?

07:27.547 --> 07:30.483
Well, in a sense, you're my boss,
so it would've been weird.

07:30.917 --> 07:34.654
Yeah, I guess I see what you're saying.
I never see you as an employee, though.

07:34.720 --> 07:35.688
No, I know.

07:35.755 --> 07:37.957
And believe me when--
When I say you're the boss,

07:38.024 --> 07:39.525
I just mean technically.

07:41.194 --> 07:44.464
I mean, we both know your mom
is the real boss around here.

07:46.499 --> 07:47.900
I don't think we both know that.

07:49.202 --> 07:52.071
No, no, you're right.
You're both officially in charge.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.041
-Officially and actually.
-Sure, fine.

07:55.107 --> 07:57.743
-I feel like you're patronizing me.
-Patronizing.

08:00.012 --> 08:01.848
Travis!

08:02.882 --> 08:03.916

Dank, Dabby. Thank you guys so much
for all your support.

08:13.593 --> 08:16.562
Not to mention all the business
you guys brought this morning.

08:16.629 --> 08:18.764
-But you did mention it.
-[all laugh]

08:19.198 --> 08:20.666
Well, guys, you know what?

08:20.733 --> 08:23.202
As the boss around here,
I'd like to talk to you

08:23.269 --> 08:27.006
about a very exciting business
opportunity. Please, step into my office.

08:27.073 --> 08:29.075
-Ah.
-[laughs]

08:29.141 --> 08:31.544
Your office has no walls, man.

08:32.979 --> 08:35.881
But it does have a floor
and that's like a wall for your feet.

08:36.916 --> 08:37.950
[laughing]

08:38.183 --> 08:39.150
What?

08:40.119 --> 08:41.554
-What?
-I don't know.

08:42.154 --> 08:43.523
I'm on the wall.

08:45.791 --> 08:47.059
-Who is this?
-You see, guys?

08:47.126 --> 08:48.628
That's what I'm talking about.

08:48.694 --> 08:51.163
You guys have what Stephen King
once called IT.

08:51.230 --> 08:52.098
-Ooh.
-Oh.

08:52.164 --> 08:53.132
[laughs]

08:53.966 --> 08:57.703
Last I checked, you guys are pretty close
to 100,000 subscribers, right?

08:57.770 --> 09:00.072
A hundred and one thousand
three hundred sixty-four.

09:01.707 --> 09:02.642
-Ish.
-Ehh.

09:03.709 --> 09:06.879
For marijuana performers like yourselves
to survive in the fast-paced,

09:06.946 --> 09:09.849
ganja-tainment sector,
you're gonna need corporate sponsorship.

09:10.082 --> 09:12.952
-I don't know if you've had any offers.
-I don't know either.

09:13.619 --> 09:14.287
Okay.

09:15.688 --> 09:16.689
Here's the deal.

09:17.223 --> 09:19.825
I wanna get
into the Dank and Dabby business.

09:26.832 --> 09:27.700
Well, that's...

09:28.734 --> 09:29.735
very flattering,

09:30.236 --> 09:31.103
but...

09:31.904 --> 09:35.575
we're kind of just doing
the monogamy thing right now.

09:35.641 --> 09:36.309
No. I'm not--

09:36.576 --> 09:38.644
You can check back in
after Valentine's Day,

09:38.711 --> 09:41.914
-I'm sure we can squeeze you right in.
-We can squeeze you in.

09:41.981 --> 09:45.184
-That really wasn't what I meant.
-We have a safe word. It's "subway."

09:47.053 --> 09:48.321
I-- What I want...

09:49.722 --> 09:52.792
is for Ruth's Alternative Caring
to be the official sponsor

09:52.858 --> 09:55.361
of your YouTube channel.
I can see you asking yourselves,

09:55.628 --> 09:56.929
"What does sponsorship mean?"

09:57.363 --> 09:58.965
Holy shit.

10:00.633 --> 10:04.070
-Yeah, this motherfucker sees questions.
-Oh.

10:15.982 --> 10:17.617
So, simply put...

10:19.685 --> 10:24.323
in exchange for promoting our dispensary,
we will supply you with all your product.

10:25.157 --> 10:27.059
-But you already do.
-Yeah.

10:27.693 --> 10:28.828
For free.

10:30.963 --> 10:32.198
[imitating explosion]

10:34.100 --> 10:35.668
So, what do you say? Yes or no?

10:36.168 --> 10:38.771
Well, I got one question for you.

10:40.406 --> 10:42.208
Can you see it, motherfucker?

10:53.319 --> 10:54.186
[Ruth] Come in.

10:55.221 --> 10:57.423
And so Maria entered the inner sanctum

10:57.690 --> 11:00.960
of cannabis legend
Ruth Whitefeather Feldman.

11:03.362 --> 11:04.997
Maria, you're narrating.

11:05.431 --> 11:06.365
I'm doing that?

11:06.432 --> 11:09.935
Yeah. And it's very common with new users.

11:10.970 --> 11:12.671
I nod knowingly.

11:16.409 --> 11:19.245
Oh, my God, is that a picture of you
and Jimmy Carter?

11:19.311 --> 11:21.414
Yeah, good old Jimmy Earl.

11:21.680 --> 11:25.284
You know, that guy loved three things:
Weed, peanuts and failure.

11:29.288 --> 11:31.357
Which brings me to you, Maria.

11:32.858 --> 11:34.860
You know, just a few days ago...

11:35.428 --> 11:40.232
you entered my store
afraid to take a bite of pot brownie.

11:40.299 --> 11:43.803
I explained to you that I was out
of Weight Watchers points.

11:45.037 --> 11:48.441
Yes. And then last night,
you showed up alone at a cannabis rally,

11:48.707 --> 11:50.943
straddling a Harley wearing that hat.

11:51.010 --> 11:52.878
I know, right? Check it out.

11:52.945 --> 11:55.047
Number sign, "stoner"!

11:57.016 --> 11:59.785
Sweetheart,
you're having a midlife crisis.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.954
And as your pot dealer and shaman--

12:02.021 --> 12:03.122
You're a shaman?

12:03.189 --> 12:05.324
Yes. And a rabbi.

12:06.992 --> 12:10.129
I strongly advise you
to just ease into this.

12:10.196 --> 12:12.364
There's no need
to radically change your life.

12:12.431 --> 12:14.400
But my life is boring.

12:14.467 --> 12:17.169
Just yesterday,
I was pushing my 5-year-old on the swing,

12:17.236 --> 12:20.339
and I thought to myself,
"Sure, Connor's swinging,

12:20.406 --> 12:24.176
Connor's going up and down,
but I'm not going anywhere.

12:24.243 --> 12:27.480
I'm just pushing him, like a sucker."

12:30.049 --> 12:30.916
[knock on door]

12:31.350 --> 12:33.853
-Ruth, something's wrong with Carter.
-Excuse me.

12:35.521 --> 12:37.490
He's been frozen like that
for ten minutes.

12:42.428 --> 12:43.796
Carter, are you okay?

12:46.031 --> 12:46.899
Carter.

12:49.502 --> 12:50.369
Yeah.

12:51.303 --> 12:52.171
I just--

12:54.073 --> 12:55.274
I need to, uh, uh...

12:58.144 --> 12:59.011
I gotta go...

13:00.813 --> 13:01.947
Yeah.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.153
He's going towards your office.

13:08.254 --> 13:10.789
He's entering the room, closing the door.

13:11.790 --> 13:14.793
-He's locking the door to your off--
-Maria, you're narrating.

13:15.794 --> 13:16.929
I'm sorry.

13:17.229 --> 13:19.398
I said, my voice tinged with regret.

13:22.368 --> 13:24.803
Do you think it's a PTSD thing?

13:25.237 --> 13:27.439
Probably. I'm not a doctor.

13:28.474 --> 13:31.477
Well, neither am I.
Why would you even accuse me of that?

13:40.920 --> 13:42.955
Carter, it's Ruth. How you doing?

13:43.489 --> 13:44.356
Sorry, Ruth.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.393
I just... need some time alone.

13:48.360 --> 13:50.963
You got it.
You can stay in there all day if you want.

13:52.031 --> 13:53.098
If you like music...

13:53.499 --> 13:56.468
I got the complete Joni Mitchell on vinyl
behind the desk.

13:58.871 --> 14:01.540
Start with "Blue" and then go backwards.

14:02.942 --> 14:03.609
Thank you.

14:04.543 --> 14:07.379
Also, I know you don't partake...
but you might check out

14:07.446 --> 14:10.249
some of the books I have
on all the good things pot can do

14:10.316 --> 14:13.586
for anxiety, stress, depression.

14:14.320 --> 14:17.623
You know, there's a reason
they call it "cannabis," not "can't-abis."

14:18.090 --> 14:18.991
[chuckles]

14:21.527 --> 14:22.928
Did you get that in there?

14:25.030 --> 14:26.565
Yeah, I-- I got it in here.

14:27.166 --> 14:28.167
And most importantly,

14:28.234 --> 14:30.603
if you ever wanna talk,
my door's always open.

14:31.570 --> 14:33.138
Well, not-- Not now.

14:34.473 --> 14:36.041
You've got it locked. [chuckles]

14:36.575 --> 14:40.179
And we're still talking,
so... the door is a nonissue.

14:46.118 --> 14:47.620
Hello there. I'm Travis.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.421
And I'm Olivia, his employee.

14:51.523 --> 14:53.459
Welcome to Strain O' the Day.

14:54.059 --> 14:55.895
You know the Haze family of pot.

14:55.961 --> 14:58.497
Purple Haze, Cambodian Haze
and Lemon Haze.

14:58.564 --> 15:01.533
Today we're offering one
of those strains' lesser-known cousins.

15:02.167 --> 15:03.535
Rutherford B. Haze.

15:06.038 --> 15:09.975
A moving tribute in cannabis dedicated
to the legacy of our 19th president,

15:10.042 --> 15:14.013
perhaps best known for taking office
via the Compromise of 1876.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.948
-And while President--
-One thing--

15:16.015 --> 15:16.682
-Sorry.
-Go ahead.

15:17.149 --> 15:20.452
No, I was just going to say
that while President Hayes

15:20.519 --> 15:21.587
ended Reconstruction,

15:21.654 --> 15:25.190
Rutherford B. Haze will begin
your reconstruction.

15:29.061 --> 15:30.529
Did you just wink at the camera?

15:32.298 --> 15:34.133
What's next, finger guns?

15:36.402 --> 15:41.140
So, come on down to Ruth's
and pick up our Strain O' the Day today.

15:41.206 --> 15:42.074
Today.

15:51.283 --> 15:52.184
Pete, turn it off.

15:57.089 --> 15:58.324
Hey, Carter, it's Pete.

15:59.325 --> 16:02.127
I'm gonna knock now,
so don't be scared, okay?

16:05.464 --> 16:06.665
Hey, Carter, it's Pete.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.669
-You okay?
-Yeah, Pete.

16:11.303 --> 16:12.171
I'm fine.

16:13.005 --> 16:16.575
Listen, I don't claim to know
what you went through in the war.

16:18.043 --> 16:21.647
I'm sure it's nothing like growing up
on a hippie commune in Humboldt County

16:21.714 --> 16:26.018
with watchtowers and weekly drills
where we bayoneted dummies

16:26.085 --> 16:27.453
dressed like DEA agents.

16:30.222 --> 16:31.323
Jesus Christ.

16:33.258 --> 16:35.394
You've seen the veterans
who come in the store.

16:35.461 --> 16:37.429
Smoking really does them good.

16:38.030 --> 16:38.731
Helps them cope.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.733
It's an amazing plant, man.

16:41.300 --> 16:42.167
And--

16:42.768 --> 16:46.672
There's a reason they call it "cannabis,"
not "can't-abis."

16:50.776 --> 16:52.378
It's funnier when Ruth tells it.

16:53.779 --> 16:56.415
Hey, Pete.
Can I talk to Carter for a minute?

16:57.616 --> 16:59.151
Carter, don't hang up.

17:00.386 --> 17:02.688
The next voice you hear
is gonna be Travis'.

17:03.489 --> 17:05.089
Travis, the door is yours.

17:10.295 --> 17:11.163
Carter?

17:11.663 --> 17:12.698
I'm just checking in.

17:14.266 --> 17:17.136
I know you think of me as your boss,
but I'm also your friend.

17:19.505 --> 17:21.205
Also, you know...

17:21.707 --> 17:23.509
we're both proud black men.

17:25.511 --> 17:27.479
I think we might also be Leos, too.

17:29.248 --> 17:31.717
Headstrong... charismatic.

17:32.051 --> 17:36.155
♪ I could drink a case of you ♪

17:36.488 --> 17:38.424
All right... good talk.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.093
Stay woke, brother.

17:43.195 --> 17:48.233
♪ Oh, I would still be on my feet ♪

17:49.501 --> 17:50.569
Is this a real ID?

17:51.203 --> 17:52.404
-Yeah.
-Great, come on in.

17:55.674 --> 17:56.542
Mom.

17:58.410 --> 18:01.480
As you saw this morning,
Dank and Dabby are very popular.

18:02.281 --> 18:05.484
And so I've arranged for them
to promote us in exchange for free pot.

18:06.118 --> 18:09.555
And that's what we're gonna do.
I'm not asking, I'm just letting you know.

18:11.523 --> 18:12.391
Is that okay?

18:14.493 --> 18:17.663
Travis, believe it or not,
I did read your business proposal,

18:17.729 --> 18:21.500
and I don't remember your vision
of the future including Dank and Dabby.

18:22.734 --> 18:25.637
No, but there is a section
called "Web Presence."

18:26.271 --> 18:28.240
Yes, but there wasn't a subsection

18:28.307 --> 18:32.845
called Hitching Your Financial Wagon
to Two Burned-Out Cosmic Dipshits.

18:35.380 --> 18:36.515
Unless I missed that.

18:36.849 --> 18:39.551
Which is possible,
because I'm old and out of touch.

18:39.618 --> 18:42.354
You're not old and out of touch.
You're just old and mean.

18:43.589 --> 18:46.325
Olivia,
you wanna settle a family argument?

18:46.391 --> 18:47.259
Nope.

18:48.627 --> 18:50.462
There you go, two against one.

19:04.743 --> 19:07.279
Hey, Carter? How you feeling?

19:09.214 --> 19:10.349
Kind of trying not to.

19:13.318 --> 19:16.255
Listen, I know everybody wants you
to toke up,

19:16.321 --> 19:17.823
but please don't feel any pressure.

19:20.626 --> 19:23.829
Between you and me,
I'm pretty ambivalent about weed myself.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.531
I mean, I smoke sometimes, but...

19:27.232 --> 19:30.335
where I'm from, a lot of people
start with pot and end up on meth.

19:31.837 --> 19:32.704
Like my brother.

19:34.640 --> 19:35.674
He's in rehab.

19:35.908 --> 19:38.644
We had an intervention
with him over Thanksgiving.

19:39.778 --> 19:41.947
He stole my car and the turkey.

19:45.284 --> 19:45.951
You get them back?

19:46.852 --> 19:49.321
The car... not the turkey.

19:51.256 --> 19:54.593
But in the end, Thanksgiving's
really all about the sides, right?

19:56.662 --> 19:58.864
I lost three buddies in Fallujah
on Thanksgiving.

20:00.199 --> 20:00.866
Oh, God.

20:06.238 --> 20:07.673
I don't know what to say to that.

20:09.308 --> 20:10.309
Nobody does.

20:13.612 --> 20:16.215
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

20:22.988 --> 20:25.457
You think Ruth'll be mad
I peed in her bong?

20:28.594 --> 20:29.494
No.

20:29.928 --> 20:31.263
She does it all the time.

20:32.864 --> 20:36.235
And now because you, the fans,
have asked.

20:36.468 --> 20:42.241
And we, the people of which
whom you are fans of, responded.

20:43.609 --> 20:46.778
We now present to you
a brand-new montage.

20:47.012 --> 20:49.748
-The Best of Dank and Dabby Coughing,
-The Best of Dank and Dabby Coughing,

20:49.815 --> 20:51.316
-Volume Four.
-Volume Four.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.687
[coughing] Oh, shi-- Oh, my--

20:56.255 --> 20:58.257
[coughing]

21:00.259 --> 21:02.327
This is one of my favorite pieces.

21:02.461 --> 21:04.763
It represents a Swahili tribe, I think,

21:04.830 --> 21:07.933
and I found it
from a man at Washington State.

21:08.634 --> 21:09.701
Come-- Dab.

21:11.803 --> 21:13.805
[coughing]

21:15.274 --> 21:17.276
[coughing]

21:18.343 --> 21:19.778
Should I call 911?

21:20.579 --> 21:22.581
[Dabby coughing]

21:28.053 --> 21:29.454
Come on, Dab.

21:29.655 --> 21:31.490
I'm trying to do important stuff here.

21:31.556 --> 21:33.558
[coughing]

21:34.693 --> 21:35.661
-Oh.
-Whoa.

21:35.727 --> 21:36.762
Shit is cool.

21:36.828 --> 21:39.564
911--? Yes, this is an emergency, 911.

21:39.665 --> 21:40.532
I'm fine.

21:42.734 --> 21:44.736
[both coughing]

21:55.013 --> 21:57.449
Well, clearly they're very talented.

22:02.354 --> 22:05.691
We're not talking about any more free
product than I've seen you give away

22:05.757 --> 22:07.959
-to people on a daily basis.
-That's medicinal.

22:08.593 --> 22:11.897
I hate to break it to you, Mom,
but adult use is legal now.

22:11.963 --> 22:15.701
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but those two people are not adults.

22:17.102 --> 22:19.504
Not adults?
You spent a night in jail for jumping

22:19.571 --> 22:21.573
off a truck onto a martial arts teacher.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.809
Hey. That was activism.

22:25.977 --> 22:27.813
Look, Mom, face facts.

22:27.879 --> 22:31.616
All right, yes, marijuana is love,
marijuana is healing,

22:31.683 --> 22:33.585
but marijuana is also this.

22:34.453 --> 22:35.587
[Dank coughing over computer]

22:37.589 --> 22:39.624
[Dank]  Smoke just came out of everywhere.

22:44.096 --> 22:46.765
Maria, before you leave,
I need to check your ID.

22:52.771 --> 22:54.506
But I'm on my way out.

22:56.575 --> 22:59.544
Yeah, but the Maria who's leaving

22:59.878 --> 23:02.647
is not the same as the Maria who entered.

23:08.420 --> 23:10.021
Jesus, I miss Carter.

23:18.663 --> 23:19.831
Carter?

23:25.971 --> 23:27.105
For what it's worth,

23:27.606 --> 23:30.175
the first time I smoked pot
was six months ago.

23:32.110 --> 23:33.645
I was terrified.

23:34.613 --> 23:36.882
My parents always told me
it was for weak people.

23:38.683 --> 23:42.454
Then I tried it with some friends,
non-Asians of course, and...

23:43.989 --> 23:46.191
I wouldn't even say it was good or bad.

23:46.825 --> 23:47.692
Just that...

23:48.727 --> 23:52.097
for the first time in my life
I felt like I was living in the moment.

23:55.433 --> 23:56.535
And as for weakness,

23:56.601 --> 24:00.205
I don't know anyone on Earth
who isn't using something or someone

24:00.472 --> 24:03.208
to cope with...
other somethings or someones.

24:05.043 --> 24:06.845
The only question that matters is...

24:08.180 --> 24:09.614
does it work for you?

24:16.888 --> 24:17.756
Thank you.

24:18.723 --> 24:19.624
You're welcome.

24:21.927 --> 24:24.930
I gotta go empty this, so excuse me.

24:36.474 --> 24:37.475
You ready?

24:39.077 --> 24:39.945
Yeah.

24:45.884 --> 24:46.885
Pete.

24:47.919 --> 24:52.724
Carter, for your first time
I've chosen something gentle and euphoric.

24:53.592 --> 24:54.759
Girl Scout Cookies.

24:57.128 --> 24:58.597
That's what you chose for me?

24:59.130 --> 25:01.733
-Girl Scout Cookies?
-Oh, don't let the name fool you.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.768
They're not really cookies.
It's marijuana.

25:11.643 --> 25:12.677
Before I do this...

25:13.845 --> 25:15.847
I just want to apologize
to everyone for--

25:16.248 --> 25:17.816
For freaking out earlier.

25:18.783 --> 25:20.852
I'm really glad you guys have my back.

25:21.620 --> 25:23.822
You never have to apologize, Carter.

25:24.990 --> 25:26.691
And you can keep my bong.

25:42.140 --> 25:43.708
Hold it for as long as you can.

It takes a minute or two.

26:00.191 --> 26:01.726
Some music might help.

Who likes Tuvan throat singing?

Who doesn't?

Give me a sec.
I'm gonna put on some Yat-Kha.
