WEBVTT

00:16.750 --> 00:19.625
( opening theme
playing )

00:26.583 --> 00:28.208
( blows whistle )

00:49.166 --> 00:52.083
Murray :
Okay, band meeting.
Jemaine?

00:52.083 --> 00:53.917
( sighs )
Yes.

00:53.917 --> 00:55.083
Yes.

00:55.083 --> 00:56.291
Bret?

00:56.291 --> 00:57.708
No.

00:57.708 --> 00:59.458
What do
you mean no?

00:59.458 --> 01:01.291
- I'm not here.
- You're not here?

01:01.291 --> 01:02.750
- No.
- Where are you?

01:02.750 --> 01:04.166
No, I was just joking.

01:04.166 --> 01:06.208
You're obviously here so
I'm putting you down--

01:06.208 --> 01:07.750
- Yeah, get on.
- All right.

01:07.750 --> 01:10.333
Murray, present.

01:10.333 --> 01:12.083
Okay.

01:12.083 --> 01:14.333
Item one:
roll call.

01:14.333 --> 01:16.625
Now I've got a sense
that you guys

01:16.625 --> 01:19.125
aren't really up
for the roll call anymore.

01:19.125 --> 01:21.208
Well, I thought
we had to do it.

01:21.208 --> 01:22.500
Officially we do.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.708
But I could just
bypass it.

01:24.708 --> 01:27.542
We'll just look and see
that you're here and carry on.

01:27.542 --> 01:29.792
We're always
in the band meetings--
we're the band.

01:29.792 --> 01:32.667
But there's been
a couple of times where
you haven't been here.

01:32.667 --> 01:34.792
All right? And I've put
you down as "absent"

01:34.792 --> 01:36.667
and I've just carried on
with the meeting.

01:36.667 --> 01:38.625
We're at a band meeting.
We haven't been here?

01:38.625 --> 01:40.500
- Yeah, twice. I mean--
- When?

01:40.500 --> 01:44.083
Well, it doesn't matter when.
They didn't go very well.

01:44.083 --> 01:46.041
Item two,

01:46.041 --> 01:47.375
band photos.

01:47.375 --> 01:49.208
Now we need to get
some better photos done

01:49.208 --> 01:51.834
so that the American media
can take us seriously,
all right?

01:51.834 --> 01:54.083
Put us in magazines,
leaflets, that sort of thing.

01:54.083 --> 01:55.500
We've got
a good photo.

01:55.500 --> 01:57.792
We've got a  photo,
but it's not good enough.

01:57.792 --> 01:59.500
I mean, look.
This one.

01:59.500 --> 02:01.625
- I like that one.
- It's a good photo.

02:01.625 --> 02:03.500
But I've had to circle
where you two are.

02:03.500 --> 02:05.875
I mean, who are all
these other people?

02:05.875 --> 02:08.166
- Well, that's Gemma's 21st.
- Right.

02:08.166 --> 02:11.041
- That's her birthday.
- That's not me.

02:11.041 --> 02:13.208
- Bret: Oh no, that's Nick.
- Is that not you?

02:13.208 --> 02:16.500
- both: No.
- No, that's Lucas.
You've circled Lucas and Nick.

02:16.500 --> 02:18.125
- Who are they?
- They're my cousins.

02:18.125 --> 02:20.583
- Where are you?
- I think I took this photo.

02:20.583 --> 02:22.291
- Yeah, I took it.
- So you're not in it?

02:22.291 --> 02:23.875
No, neither of us
are in it.

02:23.875 --> 02:26.750
- Bret: It's got a good energy.
- I know, I tell people that,

02:26.750 --> 02:28.667
but they want to know
which ones are you,

02:28.667 --> 02:30.083
and I'm trying
to point you out.

02:30.083 --> 02:31.708
Have you got
any other photos?

02:31.708 --> 02:33.875
We've got one more.
This one's just bizarre.

02:33.875 --> 02:36.667
It's a photo of Jemaine
with his ex-girlfriend Clea.

02:36.667 --> 02:40.875
But it's got a photo of Bret
superimposed over the head.

02:40.875 --> 02:43.458
- It's a wee bit strange.
- Where did you get that?

02:43.458 --> 02:45.375
I made it.
I made this one.

02:45.375 --> 02:48.333
You can't take my
personal photos and stick
other people's heads over--

02:48.333 --> 02:49.750
I loved that photo.

02:49.750 --> 02:52.333
So those are you options.
All right?

02:52.333 --> 02:54.750
I mean, this one here,
you're not in.

02:54.750 --> 02:56.417
And this one here
you're in,

02:56.417 --> 02:59.083
but you shouldn't be.

03:00.250 --> 03:02.792
So my point is,
what we need to do

03:02.792 --> 03:04.625
is what's called a...

03:04.625 --> 03:07.250
photo shoot.

03:07.250 --> 03:09.083
M'kay?

03:09.083 --> 03:10.708
Murray: Okay.

03:10.708 --> 03:14.166
A bit more movement,
you're too up and down.

03:14.166 --> 03:16.208
Move your arms about.

03:16.208 --> 03:18.208
A bit more natural.
That's good.

03:18.208 --> 03:20.750
- ( clicking )
- Can I have a look
in the camera, Murray?

03:20.750 --> 03:22.875
No, this is New Zealand
government property.

03:22.875 --> 03:25.917
It's a passport camera.
Only Greg can touch it--
eh, Greg?

03:25.917 --> 03:29.000
- Uh, yeah.
- I can't even touch it.

03:30.250 --> 03:31.625
That's good, Bret.

03:31.625 --> 03:34.041
Jemaine, you look
depressed. Smile.

03:34.041 --> 03:36.875
- I'm supposed to,
I'm in a band.
- Who wants to hear a sad band?

03:36.875 --> 03:38.500
This is the cool
look for a band.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.959
But what about
your hands in the air
and smile?

03:40.959 --> 03:42.500
No that's not
what bands do.

03:42.500 --> 03:44.792
Bands don't
put their arms in
the air and smile.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.792
I've seen that.
I've seen musicians
do that.

03:46.792 --> 03:48.625
- That's gymnasts, Murray.
- Is it?

03:48.625 --> 03:52.083
- Yes.
- Greg, is is musicians
or gymnasts that...?

03:52.083 --> 03:54.375
- Gymnasts.
- When they--

03:54.375 --> 03:56.708
Okay, it looks weird.

03:56.708 --> 03:58.500
Um, Bret, you look
quite small.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.500
It looks sort of like
trick photography.

04:00.500 --> 04:03.333
- Jemaine: It's Bret's fault.
- It's like "Lord of the Rings."

04:03.333 --> 04:05.667
Jemaine, you look
like an ogre that works
in the library.

04:05.667 --> 04:09.792
Yeah, I think
it's your fault, Bret.
You're just too small.

04:13.583 --> 04:16.959
Bret, do you, uh,
do you like penguins?

04:16.959 --> 04:18.667
Yeah... no.

04:18.667 --> 04:22.000
Sometimes I'm glad
that we don't live
in New Zealand anymore.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.583
'Cause of all
those penguins.

04:23.583 --> 04:26.417
- Remember how
there'd be penguins?
- Yeah.

04:26.417 --> 04:29.417
Bret, I'm kind of doing
all the work in this
conversation.

04:29.417 --> 04:33.125
- What's wrong?
- I'm just feeling a little
bit body conscious.

04:33.125 --> 04:36.291
- What do you mean,
"body conscious"?
- I just feel very small.

04:36.291 --> 04:39.041
After the photo shoot,
I was a lot smaller
than I thought I was.

04:39.041 --> 04:41.000
- Are you bulimic
or something?
- No.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.583
I just feel like...

04:42.583 --> 04:46.125
you know, all these
novelty musicians are
a lot bigger than me.

04:46.125 --> 04:48.250
- Is that what's
made you bulimic?
- No.

04:48.250 --> 04:49.708
I just need
to eat more.

04:49.708 --> 04:52.792
Mm.
Sounds like bulimia.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.417
I'm not bulimic.

04:54.417 --> 04:57.708
Hey, Bret, do you remember
that time after your mom's
60th birthday,

04:57.708 --> 04:59.625
- how you got really drunk?
- Yeah.

04:59.625 --> 05:02.250
Yeah, I think I heard you
in the bathroom afterwards

05:02.250 --> 05:04.500
being a little bit
bulimic.

05:04.500 --> 05:07.458
What I really need
is just some-- just some
compliments, I think.

05:07.458 --> 05:09.708
You could give me
some compliments.
That would do it.

05:09.708 --> 05:12.333
- You want me to
give you a compliment?
- That'd be great, yeah.

05:12.333 --> 05:16.000
I'm not gonna
give you compliments.
It'd be weird.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.708
Yeah, it might be
a bit weird.

05:17.708 --> 05:21.208
Don't worry about it.
I'm gonna go to bed.

05:36.750 --> 05:39.792
Bret? Bret?

05:39.792 --> 05:41.500
- Bret!
- Jemaine?

05:41.500 --> 05:44.125
- What are you doing?
- It's not Jemaine.

05:44.125 --> 05:47.542
It's 1972 David Bowie
from the Ziggy Stardust tour.

05:47.542 --> 05:49.959
Wow, you look a lot
like Jemaine.

05:49.959 --> 05:52.417
No, I'm David Bowie.

05:52.417 --> 05:54.208
Mm, what are you
doing in my room?

05:54.208 --> 05:55.750
This is a dream, Bret.

05:55.750 --> 05:58.583
It's all part
of your freaky dream.

05:58.583 --> 06:01.208
- Oh, right.
- Am I freaking
you out, Bret?

06:01.208 --> 06:04.291
- Is this a freaky dream?
- I've had some pretty
freaky dreams.

06:04.291 --> 06:07.083
- Have you?
- Yeah, I had one where
I was a guinea pig,

06:07.083 --> 06:08.542
but with my face.

06:08.542 --> 06:10.917
And I had another one
where I was a...

06:10.917 --> 06:12.750
I was a giraffe,
but then--

06:12.750 --> 06:15.583
Yeah, okay. Listen, Bret,
I don't have much time, man.

06:15.583 --> 06:19.333
I'm just here
to tell you don't worry
about your body image.

06:19.333 --> 06:22.708
People used
to give me crap about
being thin all the time.

06:22.708 --> 06:25.708
But I just broke through
their false barriers.

06:25.708 --> 06:27.667
What about the novelty-music
paparazzi?

06:27.667 --> 06:30.333
Oh, the media monkeys
and the junket junkies

06:30.333 --> 06:32.959
will invite you to
the plastic pantomime.

06:32.959 --> 06:36.750
- Throw their invites away.
- I'm not really sure what
you're talking about.

06:36.750 --> 06:39.125
I want to give you
one more piece of advice.

06:39.125 --> 06:41.291
Get an eye patch, man.

06:41.291 --> 06:44.667
- I'm sorry?
- Get an eye patch.

06:44.667 --> 06:46.166
Oh yeah,
I've got an eye patch.

06:46.166 --> 06:47.542
- Do you?
- Yeah.

06:47.542 --> 06:49.291
- Wear it.
- Okay.

06:49.291 --> 06:51.750
♪ Wear the eye
patch, Bret ♪

06:51.750 --> 06:55.125
♪ Wear the funky
funky eye patch. ♪

06:55.125 --> 06:57.333
- Bye, Bret.
- Bye-bye, David Bowie.

06:57.333 --> 07:00.458
- Heed my advice,
wear the eye patch.
- Watch out for the table!

07:00.458 --> 07:03.667
- ( crashes )
- Sorry about the table, Bret.

07:10.875 --> 07:13.166
No no, he's not a midget.
He's just-- he's thin.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.500
Okay?
And then the other one's
slightly bigger,

07:15.500 --> 07:18.083
- so there's two
different sizes there.
- ( guys singing )

07:18.083 --> 07:19.917
There's the full range.
Yeah.

07:19.917 --> 07:22.625
- Okay, see you soon.
- Hey, Murray.

07:22.625 --> 07:24.834
- Hi, guys.
- Bret: Hey, Murray.

07:24.834 --> 07:26.667
Check this out.

07:26.667 --> 07:30.458
- What is it?
- It's the latest copy of
"Novelty Hit-Makers" magazine.

07:30.458 --> 07:32.834
Page eight,
I've bookmarked it there.

07:34.708 --> 07:36.166
- Jemaine: Hey.
- Yeah.

07:36.166 --> 07:37.625
- Oh, that's us.
- That's right.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.625
We're in it.
Did you stick that
on there?

07:39.625 --> 07:41.834
- No, it's real, Jemaine.
- Wow.

07:41.834 --> 07:43.875
- Bret, what's wrong
with your eye?
- Hmm?

07:43.875 --> 07:46.708
Oh nothing's wrong with it.
This is my new look.

07:46.708 --> 07:48.291
- New look?
- Yeah.

07:48.291 --> 07:50.542
If you're gonna be cool,
why don't you just
have a goatee?

07:50.542 --> 07:53.083
- This photo... looks silly.
- Silly?

07:53.083 --> 07:55.750
You look silly now.
That's a good photo--
what do you mean?

07:55.750 --> 07:58.792
- Bret's bulimic.
- What? No, I'm not.

07:58.792 --> 08:01.875
- Are you?
- No. I had some
body-image issues,

08:01.875 --> 08:03.708
but I'm all good now.

08:03.708 --> 08:05.959
Well, that's not
really my business,

08:05.959 --> 08:08.667
that's sort of regarded
as personal business.

08:08.667 --> 08:12.000
All right?
I'm dealing with
the business side of things.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Like that photo.
That's got us some heat.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.542
We've got a big meeting
coming up.

08:15.542 --> 08:17.708
Is it a major
record label
or something?

08:17.708 --> 08:21.166
No, it's the next best thing.
It's a company that sells
greeting cards.

08:21.166 --> 08:22.917
- Greeting cards?
- Mm.

08:22.917 --> 08:25.875
But you know those ones
that open up and they
have a tune in them?

08:25.875 --> 08:27.417
Where does it
come from?

08:27.417 --> 08:29.667
You don't know.
It's in the card
somewhere.

08:29.667 --> 08:31.875
- It's not an album?
- No.

08:31.875 --> 08:34.750
That's the whole thing.
It's a secret.
Only they know.

08:34.750 --> 08:36.917
- They put a tape in there?
- No.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.875
It's a magic card
with music in it,

08:38.875 --> 08:41.959
and they want us to be
part of their magic cards.

08:41.959 --> 08:44.166
So just from here on
what I think we should do

08:44.166 --> 08:46.166
is just keep cool heads.
Bret,

08:46.166 --> 08:47.667
all right,
don't be bulimic;

08:47.667 --> 08:49.750
Jemaine, you know,
look after Bret;

08:49.750 --> 08:51.917
and me, just don't
blow this one, I guess.

08:51.917 --> 08:56.083
- Mmm.
- So all of us,
let's rock it out.

08:56.083 --> 08:58.208
Is that a music term,
"rock it out"?

08:58.208 --> 08:59.750
Yeah, that's one.

08:59.750 --> 09:02.375
Okay.
Oh heavens.

09:04.500 --> 09:09.250
You know how you
tend to prefer me
out of me and Bret?

09:09.250 --> 09:11.458
- No.
- Yeah, when you see us,

09:11.458 --> 09:14.458
you just flirt
a little bit more
with me.

09:14.458 --> 09:15.875
A tiny-- sorry, Doug.

09:15.875 --> 09:17.542
It's fine.

09:17.542 --> 09:20.166
- Happy anniversary,
by the way.
- Thanks.

09:20.166 --> 09:22.542
- Happy anniversary.
- Thanks, Jemaine.

09:22.542 --> 09:24.291
- You know, you'd prefer me?
- Yes...

09:24.291 --> 09:25.667
- Right?
- Yeah?

09:25.667 --> 09:28.125
Yeah well, just pretend
you prefer Bret.

09:28.125 --> 09:29.208
Okay.

09:29.208 --> 09:30.708
Give him
some compliments.

09:30.708 --> 09:32.667
Say, like,
"you look hot," or...

09:32.667 --> 09:34.792
I-I don't really know,
it's not my forte.

09:34.792 --> 09:37.834
Okay, I can do that.
It'll be like our
secret plan together.

09:37.834 --> 09:39.959
Exactly, thanks.
It'll just help him

09:39.959 --> 09:41.625
with a medical condition
that he's got.

09:41.625 --> 09:45.083
I'd compliment him
myself but I think it
might be gay.

09:45.083 --> 09:47.667
Oh no, that's not gay
at all.

09:47.667 --> 09:49.000
- Isn't it?
- Oh no.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.542
To tell
a friend he looks good?
No, that's not gay.

09:51.542 --> 09:53.291
Maybe I will.

09:53.291 --> 09:56.250
I mean, if you two
were to make love,
that would be gay.

09:56.250 --> 09:59.834
Yeah, that would be--
that would be gay.

09:59.834 --> 10:02.708
Two men, touching
each other physically

10:02.708 --> 10:05.125
and emotionally.

10:05.125 --> 10:07.458
Erotically caressing
each other on the...

10:07.458 --> 10:10.208
- Yeah, that sounds more--
- ...hood of a car...

10:10.208 --> 10:11.834
Hey, thanks for
your help anyway.

10:11.834 --> 10:13.625
...in the back
of a movie theater.

10:13.625 --> 10:16.667
Hey, Mel, what do you
do here, at university,
I was wondering.

10:16.667 --> 10:19.375
Oh, I'm the junior
professor of psychology.

10:19.375 --> 10:20.625
Huh.

10:20.625 --> 10:23.375
What do you
do here, Doug?

10:23.375 --> 10:25.834
I was the senior professor
of psychology.

10:25.834 --> 10:28.208
But I was fired.

10:28.208 --> 10:30.500
And now I just
hang around here.

10:35.959 --> 10:37.583
Hey, Bret?

10:37.583 --> 10:40.875
Oh hey, man.
How's it going?

10:45.750 --> 10:47.291
Your beard is good.

10:47.291 --> 10:49.792
- Huh?
- It's just a compliment
for you-- your beard.

10:49.792 --> 10:52.250
Just a compliment about
your beard being good.

10:52.250 --> 10:54.375
- Thank you.
- And also I have
another one here:

10:54.375 --> 10:58.542
you're good at finding
shortcuts around this
part of town.

10:58.542 --> 10:59.708
I appreciate that.

10:59.708 --> 11:01.875
Would it be gay
to write you a song

11:01.875 --> 11:04.000
to cheer you up?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.041
No.

11:10.917 --> 11:14.000
It's called, "Bret,
You Got it Going on."

12:59.125 --> 13:02.333
Can I please have
a look at the lyrics?

13:04.708 --> 13:07.625
This is another one
of your weird songs, man.

13:07.625 --> 13:10.542
- In what way?
- What is that about,
"sometimes I put a wig on you

13:10.542 --> 13:12.750
- when we're on tour"?
- Put a wig on you?

13:12.750 --> 13:16.041
No. I didn't say
anything like that.

13:16.041 --> 13:18.417
- Well, it's definitely
a bit gay.
- What is?

13:18.417 --> 13:20.834
Putting a wig on me
while I'm asleep.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.917
I think sometimes you
hear what you want to hear.

13:22.917 --> 13:27.041
It wouldn't be gay
to put a wig on a man
and pretend they're a woman.

13:27.041 --> 13:30.708
How could that be gay
if you were pretending
they're a woman?

13:32.125 --> 13:33.875
Not that I did it.

13:41.750 --> 13:44.083
Bret? Bret?

13:44.083 --> 13:45.500
Bret!?

13:45.500 --> 13:48.083
Hey, it's 1980
David Bowie,

13:48.083 --> 13:50.208
from the music video
"Ashes to Ashes."

13:50.208 --> 13:53.166
- Hey, David Bowie.
- Did you try out
the eye patch?

13:53.166 --> 13:55.500
Yeah, not so good.
Didn't work.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.166
I lost my
depth perception.

13:57.166 --> 13:59.500
- Oh no, did you?
- Yeah, I missed my chair.

13:59.500 --> 14:02.250
- Oh God.
- Sat down and fell
on the floor.

14:02.250 --> 14:03.417
That's terrible.

14:03.417 --> 14:05.458
And then I walked
into a door.

14:05.458 --> 14:07.166
Actually,
come to think of it,

14:07.166 --> 14:09.917
the same thing
happened to me when
I wore an eye patch.

14:09.917 --> 14:11.917
It was--
oh, it was always,

14:11.917 --> 14:13.834
"Bowie's bumped
into a door."

14:13.834 --> 14:15.792
- Hey, David Bowie?
- Yes, Bret?

14:15.792 --> 14:17.917
Do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

14:17.917 --> 14:19.750
Of course, Bret.
That's what I'm here for.

14:19.750 --> 14:22.917
Mm, if a friend of yours
puts a wig on you
when he's lonely,

14:22.917 --> 14:25.208
pretends you're a woman,
is that gay?

14:25.208 --> 14:29.375
He was pretending
you're a woman?

14:29.375 --> 14:31.750
No, that's not gay.

14:31.750 --> 14:32.917
Are you sure?

14:32.917 --> 14:35.041
Totally fine.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.500
Mm, okay.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.041
Well, that's all.

14:38.041 --> 14:40.041
Do you have any
other advice for me?

14:40.041 --> 14:41.667
Yes.

14:41.667 --> 14:45.625
It doesn't hurt to do something
absolutely outrageous.

14:45.625 --> 14:48.583
- Like what?
- Well, you'll know
what to do, Bret.

14:48.583 --> 14:52.583
And you'll know exactly
when the time is right.

15:01.125 --> 15:03.792
Jemaine:
I don't know, I just
don't like them anymore.

15:03.792 --> 15:05.875
- Penguins are great--
- Oh hey, guys.

15:05.875 --> 15:07.291
- Hey, Mel.
- Hi.

15:07.291 --> 15:09.375
Well, you're looking
good today, Bret.

15:09.375 --> 15:11.333
- Very hot.
- Thank you.

15:11.333 --> 15:12.625
Oh, that's nice
of Mel to say--

15:12.625 --> 15:15.041
- Hotter than Jemaine.
- Oh, thanks, Mel.

15:15.041 --> 15:16.667
- Mm-hmm.
- That's really kind.

15:16.667 --> 15:19.291
- Oh yeah.
- That's a nice compliment
for you.

15:19.291 --> 15:21.333
Yes, it is,
isn't it?

15:21.333 --> 15:23.834
You have a refined
bone structure

15:23.834 --> 15:25.875
whereas Jemaine 's
facial features

15:25.875 --> 15:28.708
are too deep-set to be
classically handsome.

15:28.708 --> 15:30.583
- Thank you.
- Oh.

15:30.583 --> 15:33.458
- You're a better singer too.
- Thanks, Mel.

15:33.458 --> 15:36.708
Yeah, Jemaine 's often flat,
but you are always on-key

15:36.708 --> 15:38.125
every time I come
to your shows.

15:38.125 --> 15:40.667
- Thank you.
- That's not--
that's not true.

15:40.667 --> 15:43.500
You're also really
really deep and passionate.

15:43.500 --> 15:46.333
- You know, like, you think--
- Hey, Mel-- don't you have to--

15:46.333 --> 15:48.375
- That's really nice.
- I can see it in your lyrics.

15:48.375 --> 15:49.708
- Hey!
- What?

15:49.708 --> 15:53.041
- Shh, that's enough now.
- Oh, all right.

15:53.041 --> 15:55.375
Well, I have a lot more
to say on that though.

15:55.375 --> 15:56.708
No, I don't
think you do.

15:56.708 --> 15:59.834
I think you probably
have to go somewhere now.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.583
- Thank you.
- Oh yes,

16:01.583 --> 16:03.041
I do have to go
somewhere.

16:03.041 --> 16:05.834
- It was great
to see you, Mel.
- You too.

16:05.834 --> 16:07.417
Oh God,
you're glowing today.

16:07.417 --> 16:10.250
- You're glowing.
- Thanks, Mel,
I appreciate it.

16:10.250 --> 16:13.041
- See you later, bye.
- See you.

16:15.125 --> 16:16.834
What's her problem?

16:16.834 --> 16:18.959
- She was just being nice.
- Yeah well...

16:18.959 --> 16:21.000
she went a bit far.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.792
Do you think
my facial features
are too deep-set

16:23.792 --> 16:26.208
to be considered
classically handsome?

16:26.208 --> 16:28.625
- That's what she said.
- I don't really know.

16:28.625 --> 16:31.917
- Be honest.
- I've got no idea.

16:33.291 --> 16:36.291
( greeting card
beeping tune )

16:36.291 --> 16:38.875
Bret, Bret,
uncross your legs.

16:38.875 --> 16:40.583
Bret.

16:42.542 --> 16:44.625
- ( card still beeping )
- That's funky.

16:44.625 --> 16:46.750
- I like that.
- Thank you, yes.

16:46.750 --> 16:49.250
- ( turns off card )
- Yeah, that's a fun card.

16:49.250 --> 16:50.875
Ah.

16:50.875 --> 16:52.875
Where does the music
come from?

16:52.875 --> 16:54.583
There's a small chip
and speaker set

16:54.583 --> 16:56.917
that goes into the back
of the card.

16:56.917 --> 16:58.625
Is it a CD?

16:58.625 --> 17:01.625
No, it's more like a...

17:01.625 --> 17:03.708
a chip and speaker set
that we--

17:03.708 --> 17:06.250
it's very small and it's
about the size of your thumbnail

17:06.250 --> 17:08.792
and we just put it right
inside the back of the card.

17:08.792 --> 17:10.250
Like headphones?

17:10.250 --> 17:12.542
No, this is
a computer chip

17:12.542 --> 17:15.500
that's devoted really
to one function only--

17:15.500 --> 17:19.208
- the playing of the song
when we open the card...
- ( beeping )

17:19.208 --> 17:21.750
And then, I guess you could
say its second function

17:21.750 --> 17:24.500
is turning off
at this point.

17:24.500 --> 17:26.417
Like a Walkman.

17:26.417 --> 17:29.125
No it's not--
not like a Walkman at all.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.291
Good.

17:32.291 --> 17:35.083
- Um, Mr. Armstrong?
- Please call me David.

17:35.083 --> 17:36.583
- Okay, David.
- Thank you.

17:36.583 --> 17:41.375
Um, David, when will
this meeting actually begin?

17:41.375 --> 17:43.708
Well it's, um--
it has begun.

17:43.708 --> 17:45.125
They didn't do
a roll call.

17:45.125 --> 17:46.792
You know, I believe
in potential.

17:46.792 --> 17:50.250
It's hard to define,
but I know it when I see it,

17:50.250 --> 17:52.208
and I see it
in you guys.

17:52.208 --> 17:54.583
Thank you, David.
I know what you mean.

17:54.583 --> 17:56.625
Good.
We love the track.

17:56.625 --> 17:59.083
We'd like to include it
in a card we're working on.

17:59.083 --> 18:02.000
It's a kind of futuristic
birthday card.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.583
Wow, yes,
that'd be great.

18:04.583 --> 18:07.875
And we're going to pay you
1¢ per card.

18:07.875 --> 18:11.083
How many cards would you
look at manufacturing, David?

18:11.083 --> 18:13.500
Depending on demand,
we might make as many as...

18:13.500 --> 18:16.417
- Half a million.
- Woah, that's-- we're
talking serious money.

18:16.417 --> 18:18.667
Yes, we're talking
serious money,

18:18.667 --> 18:21.000
and a lot of it too,
if we can work together.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.375
I mean, I really
need to know these guys.
What are they all about?

18:24.375 --> 18:26.959
Yep, okay.
Well, Bret,

18:26.959 --> 18:28.750
talk about yourself.

18:28.750 --> 18:31.375
Oh well, um...
I'm-- I'm Bret.

18:31.375 --> 18:32.834
Murray: Yeah?

18:34.000 --> 18:35.917
- What else?
- You're the smaller one.

18:35.917 --> 18:37.625
He's the smaller one
of the two.

18:37.625 --> 18:40.542
He's-- you're
into animals.

18:40.542 --> 18:42.166
Um, you were
bulimic recently.

18:42.166 --> 18:44.834
- I wasn't-- I wasn't bulimic.
- He's not now, he's fine now.

18:44.834 --> 18:46.542
- I'm not bulimic.
- Little touch of that.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.667
- I wasn't bulimic.
- It's cleared up.

18:48.667 --> 18:50.875
And, Jemaine,
he's the lady's man.

18:50.875 --> 18:52.166
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

18:52.166 --> 18:53.667
You said the girls
like you.

18:53.667 --> 18:56.667
I've lost confidence now.
Completely lost confidence.

18:56.667 --> 18:59.166
He's just acting
depressed 'cause he
thinks it's cool.

18:59.166 --> 19:01.000
I'm gonna interrupt
you now, for a moment,

19:01.000 --> 19:02.667
because it seems to me
that maybe...

19:02.667 --> 19:05.083
you're not that interested
in having one of your songs

19:05.083 --> 19:06.834
appear in our
greeting card, so...

19:06.834 --> 19:09.708
we are interested,
and I'm really sorry
about these guys.

19:09.708 --> 19:12.333
I hope they haven't
stuffed the whole thing up.

19:12.333 --> 19:13.708
It's just that,
you know...

19:13.708 --> 19:15.458
David Bowie:
You'll know what to do, Bret.

19:15.458 --> 19:18.041
And you'll know exactly
when the time is right.

19:18.041 --> 19:20.583
Murray:
Today they've just got
a different sort of...

19:20.583 --> 19:24.041
- Whoo-hoo!  Whoo!
- ( unzips )

19:24.041 --> 19:25.417
Waha!

19:26.708 --> 19:28.542
Murray:
Bret, what on Earth was that?

19:28.542 --> 19:31.333
I can't believe it.
It's outrageous.

19:31.333 --> 19:33.917
Absolutely outrageous.
What were you thinking?

19:33.917 --> 19:37.041
- I thought it would help.
- You thought that  would help?

19:37.041 --> 19:38.834
Oh my gosh.

19:38.834 --> 19:40.834
That's illegal,
you know?

19:40.834 --> 19:42.625
How could you do it?

19:42.625 --> 19:44.500
I thought it would
make us more memorable.

19:44.500 --> 19:48.333
Were there supposed
to be lightning bolts
on the side of it?

19:48.333 --> 19:50.125
- Yeah, looked
pretty good, eh?
- Mm.

19:50.125 --> 19:52.333
What are
you talking about?
It didn't work.

19:52.333 --> 19:54.083
The whole thing
was stupid!

19:54.083 --> 19:56.041
Well, it wasn't my idea,
Murray.

19:56.041 --> 19:58.083
David Bowie told me
to do it in a dream.

19:58.083 --> 20:00.834
Oh yeah, right, Bret.
David Bowie in a dream.

20:00.834 --> 20:02.583
- Yes.
- What are you
talking about?

20:02.583 --> 20:06.083
That's typical of you.
Major money.

20:06.083 --> 20:08.083
Something else
will come up.

20:08.083 --> 20:09.333
I don't know.

20:09.333 --> 20:12.708
Maybe I'm not cut out
for band management.

20:12.708 --> 20:14.250
It's not you, Murray.
You're good.

20:14.250 --> 20:17.458
I think it's my fault.
That's all I'm saying.

20:17.458 --> 20:20.417
If I was a better manager,
I could have changed this

20:20.417 --> 20:22.792
or turned it
into something positive.

20:22.792 --> 20:24.959
I could have stopped you
before you revealed it,

20:24.959 --> 20:26.375
or turned it into
some sort of thing,

20:26.375 --> 20:29.959
like I could have
said it was a cultural
New Zealand greeting.

20:29.959 --> 20:31.625
You know, we could
have all done it.

20:31.625 --> 20:34.625
But I'm just not
quick enough on my feet.

20:34.625 --> 20:37.959
Something else
will turn up.

20:41.917 --> 20:44.792
Bret, Bret?

20:46.333 --> 20:48.875
( sighs )

20:48.875 --> 20:50.583
Bret!

20:50.583 --> 20:54.083
It's 1986 David Bowie
from the movie "Labyrinth."

20:54.083 --> 20:55.875
Yeah, I know.

20:55.875 --> 20:59.125
So you showed your
penis to the man from
the greeting-card company?

20:59.125 --> 21:01.959
- That was your idea.
- I didn't mean
something like that.

21:01.959 --> 21:03.583
I only meant
something like...

21:03.583 --> 21:05.375
I don't know,
wear makeup or--

21:05.375 --> 21:08.500
I was wearing makeup.
I had lightning bolts
on my Wanger.

21:08.500 --> 21:11.500
I meant
on your face, Bret.
On your face.

21:11.500 --> 21:13.458
So have you got
any more advice?

21:13.458 --> 21:15.000
No, I don't
have any more advice.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.792
I've given you
all of my good advice.

21:17.792 --> 21:19.000
( sighs )

21:19.000 --> 21:21.166
Actually, I've totally
lost confidence

21:21.166 --> 21:24.542
in my ability to help people.
I'm useless.

21:24.542 --> 21:27.500
Jemaine actually thinks
that maybe you're a figment
of my imagination.

21:28.667 --> 21:32.166
I might as well be, Bret.
I might as well be.

21:32.166 --> 21:34.041
- Yeah.
- Anyway, Bret,

21:34.041 --> 21:37.208
- I have to go.
- Where are you going?

21:37.208 --> 21:39.792
I'm going to a party.
I'm already 20 minutes late.

21:39.792 --> 21:41.959
Sounds cool.
Where's the party?

21:41.959 --> 21:44.708
In space, Bret.
In space.

21:44.708 --> 21:46.291
- Space?
- Yeah.

21:46.291 --> 21:49.750
It is quite freaky,
isn't it, Bret?

21:49.750 --> 21:51.708
Yeah... no.

21:54.500 --> 21:57.375
- Goodbye, Bret.
- See you, Bowie.

Bret: So I'm guessing like,
if David Bowie isn't
that confident,

24:59.583 --> 25:02.583
then maybe--
maybe most people
aren't that confident?

25:02.583 --> 25:05.291
Which means...
I'm not gonna worry
about being confident.

25:05.291 --> 25:08.000
Yeah, we don't
need to worry about
being confident.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.333
- Yeah--
- But it's not
really him though.

25:10.333 --> 25:11.583
- I know--
- It's a dream.

25:11.583 --> 25:13.333
- I know but--
- It's your dream.

25:13.333 --> 25:15.750
I know it's my dream
but you'd still think
he'd be more confident.

25:15.750 --> 25:17.667
Yeah, can I have
your biscuit, Bret?

25:17.667 --> 25:20.583
Help yourself.
I'm not eating anymore.
I'm a bit too fat.

25:20.583 --> 25:22.750
- Hey, Murray.
- Hey guys, guess what's
in my hand.

25:22.750 --> 25:24.834
- Um...
- A biscuit?

25:24.834 --> 25:26.000
No, not even close.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.917
- Jemaine?
- Another kind of biscuit?

25:29.917 --> 25:31.667
No, I haven't got
a biscuit, have I?

25:31.667 --> 25:34.542
I said no biscuit.
It's not gonna be
another kind, is it?

25:34.542 --> 25:37.083
- Is it a really big biscuit?
- It's not a biscuit!

25:37.083 --> 25:39.375
I don't know, you know
I'm not very imaginative.

25:39.375 --> 25:41.917
You've
ruined this game.
I'll just show you.

25:42.959 --> 25:44.625
Bret:
Ah, that's flippin' awesome.

25:44.625 --> 25:47.000
- Listen.
- ( plays electronic song )

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
- Listen to that.
- Hey, but I thought
they weren't gonna...?

25:50.000 --> 25:51.959
No, Mr. Armstrong said
he admired Bret's balls.

25:51.959 --> 25:54.667
He thought we'd like
to see the prototype
of the new card.

25:54.667 --> 25:58.750
So can I get you a drink?
I think we can afford it.

25:58.750 --> 26:01.291
Are they printing
half a million cards?

26:01.291 --> 26:04.208
No, they're only
making 50. It's not
a very popular design.

26:04.208 --> 26:07.542
But we've got 50¢,
so how much are
your coffees?

26:07.542 --> 26:09.959
- 60¢.
- Can I get a copy
of that, Murray?

26:09.959 --> 26:12.125
No no, 'cause that would
cost more than 50¢,

26:12.125 --> 26:15.667
and then we'd-- we'd be down,
wouldn't we? The whole thing
would be a waste.

26:15.667 --> 26:17.250
Can I borrow it
for a bit?

26:17.250 --> 26:19.625
You can have it for one night,
but don't send it to anyone.

26:19.625 --> 26:21.417
How do they get
the music in there?

26:21.417 --> 26:23.792
It's very technical.
Did you hear what he
was talking about?

26:23.792 --> 26:25.750
It's a computer chip
with a speaker attached.

26:25.750 --> 26:28.917
- Murray:
There's a thing in there.
- Pretty much like a Walkman.
