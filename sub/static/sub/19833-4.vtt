03:13.070 --> 03:15.197
When you go to Eofervvic,

03:16.198 --> 03:18.075
will you kill my brother?

03:22.287 --> 03:25.207
Are you asking if I will,
or are you telling me to do it?

03:26.875 --> 03:28.543
The first one.

03:31.630 --> 03:34.716
I have sworn to Alfred
that Guthred will not be harmed.

(DISTANT COCK CROWS)

03:44.726 --> 03:46.645

No.

03:49.314 --> 03:52.275
You might return to find me
claimed by another, like vacant land.

03:52.401 --> 03:54.069
Gisela, no.

03:54.236 --> 03:56.321
Alfred could marry me off
to some ealdorman

03:56.446 --> 03:59.324
- and you won't be here to stop it.
- (LAUGHS)

04:00.117 --> 04:02.244
What is funny?

04:03.912 --> 04:06.540
It would not be the first time
a king has tried.

04:08.083 --> 04:09.668
You're not coming with me,

04:10.919 --> 04:14.047
- it would be too dangerous for you.
- It is for you too.

04:23.682 --> 04:24.766
I could not...

04:27.769 --> 04:30.689
I could not bear it,
to have you taken from me again.

04:41.575 --> 04:43.994
What's this? You are leaving without me?

04:44.161 --> 04:47.539
Brida has gone already.
She is gathering my men.

04:48.331 --> 04:50.667
Whatever is left of them.

04:50.792 --> 04:53.545
- You will meet them where?
- Loidis.

04:56.047 --> 05:00.010
I'd ask you to come with me, but I hear
you have been making more of your oaths.

05:02.220 --> 05:03.722
I will be with you.

05:04.890 --> 05:07.517
- Our plan doesn't change.
- You belong to Alfred.

05:07.642 --> 05:09.436
Our plan doesn't change.

05:10.604 --> 05:13.857
Alfred sends me to kill Erik
and Sigefrid.

05:13.982 --> 05:16.526
If I succeed,
then Guthred will be in my debt.

05:17.402 --> 05:19.362
And I will demand the use of his men.

05:19.488 --> 05:21.781
I have men.

05:21.907 --> 05:25.410
RAGNAR: And we have our own war,
we do not need Guthred's.

05:25.535 --> 05:26.953
How many men?

05:27.078 --> 05:29.664
- Enough to take Dunholm?
- Guthred made you a slave.

05:29.789 --> 05:33.627
And by swearing to Alfred,
you remain a slave.

05:36.546 --> 05:37.589
Why?

05:39.841 --> 05:41.760
I have my reasons.

05:43.136 --> 05:45.222
I would like to hear those reasons.

05:47.849 --> 05:50.268
I did not forget what Guthred did to me.

05:51.645 --> 05:54.397
But if it means we have
a greater chance of killing Kjartan,

05:54.523 --> 05:57.692
if it means we find our sister,
then I will do what Alfred asks.

06:04.741 --> 06:08.453
Kjartan falls, by my sword.

06:10.205 --> 06:13.500
He will, brother. He will.

06:28.223 --> 06:29.266
AETHELWOLD: Lord?

06:30.600 --> 06:32.185
You asked for me.

06:32.310 --> 06:33.853
ALFRED: I did.

06:34.938 --> 06:38.483
The king should be at the centre.

06:40.318 --> 06:42.445
ALFRED: Surrounded by his enemies.

06:45.073 --> 06:46.741
ALFRED: I am sending Uhtred to Eofervvic,

06:46.866 --> 06:49.995
to aid Guthred against the brothers
who would take the city for themselves.

06:50.120 --> 06:53.123
I want you to go with him.
Steapa shall accompany you.

06:53.248 --> 06:55.584
Remain at his side.

06:57.127 --> 07:00.255
Lord, forgive me, but I do not see
what need Uhtred would have of me.

07:00.422 --> 07:04.509
It is not Uhtred's need
that concerns me. It is mine.

07:06.303 --> 07:08.638
Guthred's misjudgments
have divided Northumbria.

07:08.763 --> 07:13.059
I sent Uhtred to re-assert Guthred's
authority, I am sending you to remind

07:13.226 --> 07:16.730
"King" Guthred of his debt
and obligations to Wessex.

07:16.855 --> 07:18.648
Surely a letter would suit the purpose?

07:20.108 --> 07:23.236
A letter is constant,

07:23.361 --> 07:25.030
whereas I shall merely come and go.

07:25.155 --> 07:27.240
Think of this as reward, Aethelwold.

07:28.700 --> 07:31.578
You have proven yourself
both in battle and within my Witan.

07:31.703 --> 07:33.788
You have also sought
greater responsibilities.

07:33.913 --> 07:37.709
In Wessex, yes, responsibilities in
Mercia, perhaps, but Northumbria?!

07:39.794 --> 07:41.254
Lord, they are almost Scots.

07:43.673 --> 07:45.133
Should I turn my hair red?

07:45.258 --> 07:47.969
- (LAUGHS)
- You will remind Uhtred of his oaths,

07:48.970 --> 07:52.599
but above all, you will reassure
our northern king

07:52.724 --> 07:54.267
that in spite of what has passed,

07:54.392 --> 07:56.978
my commitment to his prosperity
has not waned.

07:58.563 --> 08:01.650
Eoferwic must remain Christian.

08:03.360 --> 08:05.028
You do me a great honor.

08:05.153 --> 08:07.739
You shall be my eyes, ears and voice,
Aethelwold.

08:09.741 --> 08:11.159
Hmm, a bold response.

08:11.284 --> 08:13.286
Yes, Father, I thought so.

08:26.216 --> 08:27.342
Take this.

08:28.134 --> 08:30.178
It is the symbol of my kingship.

08:30.303 --> 08:32.222

08:33.306 --> 08:35.015
Make yourself ready.

08:37.894 --> 08:39.938

- Come to find you.

You weren't in your room.
Nor the brothel.

09:02.043 --> 09:04.212
Well, I have been very busy.

09:04.838 --> 09:07.132
(SNIFFS) These are for Guthred?

09:07.257 --> 09:08.591
Yes.

09:08.717 --> 09:12.178
The fortunes of kings.
Their failures are rewarded with gifts.

09:13.847 --> 09:14.889
Father.

09:16.558 --> 09:19.769
- Is something wrong?
- I need you to marry me, to Gisela.

09:19.894 --> 09:20.895
What?

09:21.020 --> 09:23.732
UHTRED: I want us to make our pledges
before I ride for Eofervvic.

09:25.066 --> 09:28.194
Mildrith has joined the order,
I am free to marry.

09:29.112 --> 09:30.947
- Do you have Alfred's blessing?
- (CLUNK)

09:31.072 --> 09:32.907
It is not Alfred I wish to marry!

09:35.910 --> 09:38.246
Beocca, this cannot wait.

09:39.122 --> 09:41.583
- You love her?
- I do.

09:44.753 --> 09:46.629
I feel you are too fond of love.

09:47.005 --> 09:49.340
Nevertheless, bring her here.

09:50.091 --> 09:51.301
But quietly.

09:51.426 --> 09:53.762
We need to be quick and discreet.

09:53.928 --> 09:55.305
Quick and discreet...

10:00.477 --> 10:02.437
We are off to the great north,
you and I.

10:02.604 --> 10:05.648
I am to be Alfred's errand boy.
He wants me away from Winchester...

10:05.774 --> 10:08.610
- Aethelwold, I am not listening...
- He wants me dead even.

10:09.527 --> 10:11.196
That is the plan, I know it!

is not so quickly broken."

10:35.845 --> 10:38.848
Now that you are bound together,

10:38.973 --> 10:40.391
Uhtred and Gisela,

10:42.393 --> 10:44.437
I can declare you man and wife.

10:55.490 --> 10:57.992

taken from you.

11:36.239 --> 11:37.782
ODDA: A Dane?

11:40.493 --> 11:42.912
You have doubts, Odda?

11:45.164 --> 11:46.916
ALFRED: Then we shall air them.

12:04.809 --> 12:09.480
Lord. Should he survive,
I fear Uhtred will not return.

12:09.606 --> 12:11.566
You believe he will break his oath?

12:11.733 --> 12:15.153
No, I believe Bebbanburg will have
a greater pull than Wessex.

12:15.278 --> 12:19.908
Should he rid Northumbria of these
Northmen he will look towards Kjartan,

12:20.033 --> 12:23.077
- his blood feud.
- Yes, but that is no bad thing.

12:23.202 --> 12:27.582
Lord, should he defeat Kjartan,
then who holds the power in Northumbria?

12:27.749 --> 12:30.418
Uhtred and Ragnar? Pagans.

12:30.543 --> 12:35.965
There is that risk, but firstly,
Uhtred is a warrior, a Viking even,

12:36.090 --> 12:38.051
- he will forever be restless.
- Perhaps.

12:38.176 --> 12:40.887
And secondly, should he turn
his attention to Bebbanburg

12:41.012 --> 12:43.348
and indeed to Northumbria as a whole,

12:43.473 --> 12:46.434
then Steapa is under instruction
to kill him.

Uhtred, you were sent north to aid
Guthred, not to go chasing revenge.

Perhaps I plan to do both, Father.

14:35.376 --> 14:39.255
I think I know what you plan. Uhtred,
revenge will not bring you peace.

Place rocks, wood and fire

We should hunt them down now,

18:09.590 --> 18:11.801
before they can turn their 50 men
into 500 men.

18:13.219 --> 18:16.806
Fifty men can win a battle in the open,

18:17.473 --> 18:21.018
but no army of any size
can breech this fortress.

18:21.936 --> 18:25.231

is to kill me,

18:26.649 --> 18:28.651
they can die trying at my gates.

20:34.735 --> 20:37.321
