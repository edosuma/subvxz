01:30.799 --> 01:32.718
You can dim the lights a bit, right?

01:32.801 --> 01:34.303
His eyes are still sensitive.

01:36.388 --> 01:37.723
This is some bullshit.

01:40.809 --> 01:41.810
I'll tell the truth.

01:41.893 --> 01:43.061
That's a first.

01:43.145 --> 01:44.146
Luke.

01:44.229 --> 01:47.858
Speak your truth, my brother.
Take your time.

01:51.069 --> 01:53.280
I've been fighting
since I was eight years old.

01:55.198 --> 01:56.199
Had to.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.619
You know, that's Harlem all day.

01:58.702 --> 02:00.787
Survival of the fittest. You know, like...

02:01.955 --> 02:03.206
You know, like Prodigy said.

02:04.166 --> 02:07.669
That's Charles Darwin, not Mobb Deep,
you ignorant bastard.

02:08.628 --> 02:09.630
Whatever.

02:10.339 --> 02:13.800
Luke Cage was on some NatGeo shit.

02:14.509 --> 02:17.846
I thought
I was getting mauled by a bear.

02:19.931 --> 02:21.224
I was so helpless.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.478
I tried to fight back, Lord knows I did,

02:24.561 --> 02:29.107
but he just kept hitting me
again and again...

02:29.191 --> 02:31.735
- You were beating your girlfriend!
- That's hearsay!

02:31.818 --> 02:33.487
This isn't a courtroom.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.827
Drea been my lady for 15 years, all right?

02:40.911 --> 02:42.704
We gonna get into it sometimes.

02:42.788 --> 02:43.872
That's how we do.

02:45.207 --> 02:46.708
We fight hard, we love hard.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.835
That shit is private.

02:49.544 --> 02:50.587
Pardon me.

02:51.838 --> 02:55.425
A man's home is supposed to be his castle.

02:56.718 --> 02:59.679
You come in there
making all sorts of assumptions.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.808
Story of my life.

03:03.392 --> 03:06.436
Running from the police.
Slapped up by the police.

03:06.520 --> 03:10.107
Beat up by the police.
Framed by the dirty police.

03:10.190 --> 03:14.653
Thrown in jail by Rafael Scarfe
for some shit I didn't even do.

03:15.237 --> 03:16.405
So now that they let me out,

03:16.488 --> 03:20.242
I finally get a chance to put that shit
behind me, get my life together.

03:20.325 --> 03:22.035
Here comes Luke Cage.

03:22.661 --> 03:25.997
And after I already defended myself
against his savagery,

03:26.081 --> 03:30.335
he came and he kicked down
the door to my house.

03:30.919 --> 03:31.795
My home.

04:01.324 --> 04:04.286
I know me losing my temper
only proved their point.

04:04.369 --> 04:05.203
You think?

04:05.287 --> 04:07.998
The fact they can shake me down
and get away with it...

04:08.081 --> 04:10.500
That's why we don't want you
in an open courtroom.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.002
That look on your face,

04:12.085 --> 04:13.920
the fact that you can
snap a conference table

04:14.004 --> 04:15.505
like it was made out of Styrofoam.

04:16.464 --> 04:19.259
The real fact is that
he is a woman and child beater.

04:20.051 --> 04:22.095
You're a self-proclaimed
officer of the law,

04:22.179 --> 04:25.265
so when when it comes to a brutality
defense, facts aren't on your side.

04:25.348 --> 04:26.349
Only perception.

04:27.434 --> 04:28.852
Given my history on the subject,

04:28.935 --> 04:32.189
I can't believe
I'm even gonna say this, but...

04:32.981 --> 04:36.526
if you're gonna fight crime,
have you considered wearing a mask?

04:37.652 --> 04:40.363
I'm 6'3", black and bulletproof.

04:40.906 --> 04:42.365
You think wearing a Lone Ranger mask

04:42.449 --> 04:44.409
is gonna keep people
from figuring out who I am?

04:44.493 --> 04:45.952
Maybe.

04:46.036 --> 04:50.165
There are people who still think Shock G
and Humpty Hump are two different people.

04:51.416 --> 04:52.417
Digital Underground?

04:53.418 --> 04:55.462
I know who Digital Underground are, Foggy.

04:55.545 --> 04:56.838
Don't look surprised.

04:56.922 --> 04:59.090
I've been known to rock a hoodie
back in the day.

05:02.177 --> 05:03.637
Oh, man, that...

05:03.720 --> 05:06.097
Seriously, what are my options, Foggy?

05:06.723 --> 05:08.725
Pay Cockroach,
this whole thing evaporates.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.394
- Nah. Mmm-mmm.
- Okay.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.063
Then we go to court.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.899
And they bring up the fact
that you're an ex-con.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.777
Framed. Exonerated.

05:18.860 --> 05:21.279
In the eyes of a jury, played correctly,

05:21.363 --> 05:24.115
you're Willie Horton
with bulletproof skin.

05:24.199 --> 05:25.700
You could go to jail for assault.

05:27.035 --> 05:29.329
- What good am I to them in jail?
- Exactly.

05:30.038 --> 05:33.500
So Ben Donovan came up with a price
that makes this whole thing go away.

05:35.085 --> 05:37.504
There's a clock on it. 72 hours.

05:43.885 --> 05:46.513
Sweet Christmas.

05:48.848 --> 05:51.101
- Weird stuff.
- I understand that. I do.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.394
- I'll check it out.
- Yeah?

05:52.477 --> 05:53.311
- Yeah.
- Wow.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.814
- This is a pretty big building.
- It's a production.

05:55.897 --> 05:56.982
Looking beautiful today.

05:57.065 --> 05:58.441
Hey, welcome!

05:58.525 --> 06:00.819
Hey! I thought everything
was happening later this evening?

06:00.902 --> 06:03.780
- I told Alex to have you come early.
- Why?

06:03.863 --> 06:06.533
Because I wanted you
to see it for yourself.

06:06.616 --> 06:10.287
Look. Stay out here, just for a bit.
Make sure no press comes in yet.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.789
- They're all coming.
- Good! The more the better.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.207
They need to see this.

06:16.835 --> 06:17.836
Come and see.

06:17.919 --> 06:21.172
- I've seen a clinic before, Mommy.
- Look at this.

06:21.256 --> 06:24.593
Look at them. Sojourner, Mary Bethune,

06:24.676 --> 06:30.432
Ida B. Wells, Bessie Coleman,
Zora Neale Hurston, Maya.

06:30.515 --> 06:33.560
You don't need to be bulletproof
to be a superhero.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.479
Black women have always had superpowers.

06:36.563 --> 06:40.692
Turning pain into progress,
nothing into nurture.

06:41.359 --> 06:43.111
That's what my grandmother did.

06:44.029 --> 06:45.030
Mama Mabel?

06:45.113 --> 06:47.907
This is her dream. All of this.

06:47.991 --> 06:50.660
The clinic. It'll have 12 rooms,

06:50.744 --> 06:54.956
day care, job placement services,
a dentist, a pharmacy.

06:55.040 --> 07:00.003
All to help young single mothers
starting fresh or starting over.

07:00.629 --> 07:02.589
I get it. "Family first."

07:02.672 --> 07:03.840
Always.

07:03.923 --> 07:07.177
This is the centerpiece
of that initiative.

07:07.260 --> 07:11.097
This is ironic.
You're building a foundation for women

07:11.181 --> 07:13.516
to protect the legacy
of Harlem's biggest madam.

07:14.351 --> 07:17.228
All the women that she exploited,
the souls she trafficked?

07:17.312 --> 07:20.065
Don't you dare disrespect her.

07:21.608 --> 07:24.778
Our family fortune
was born in a whorehouse.

07:24.861 --> 07:27.948
So what? So was jazz.

07:28.031 --> 07:31.117
You don't see people protesting
outside of Lincoln Center, do you?

07:31.993 --> 07:37.248
Your great-grandmother empowered women
who couldn't protect themselves.

07:37.332 --> 07:39.167
Mabel and Buggy Stokes

07:39.250 --> 07:44.464
fought against the white gangsters
that wanted to re-enslave Harlem.

07:45.632 --> 07:50.553
You want to talk about what we come from.
I want to talk about what we're made of.

07:51.179 --> 07:56.935
Focus on our bright future,
not our painful past.

07:58.311 --> 08:02.273
All of this, all this, of course,
will be free of charge.

08:04.192 --> 08:06.444
You're my first choice
for medical director.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.863
- Me?
- You.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.534
I should have a say in that matter.

08:13.201 --> 08:16.246
What if I don't want to heal people
with bloody money?

08:16.329 --> 08:21.543
FYI, because of my early support
of Atreus Plastics,

08:21.626 --> 08:23.712
I have experienced a windfall

08:23.795 --> 08:28.800
since it was sold just a few days ago
to Glenn Industries.

08:28.883 --> 08:33.346
The millions that I made I am pouring
right back into this community.

08:34.389 --> 08:36.725
Black wealth is black power, baby.

08:37.392 --> 08:43.815
That's what I wanna do with this clinic,
with the complex, this whole initiative.

08:43.898 --> 08:46.651
I want to bring miracles to Harlem.

08:46.735 --> 08:47.902
For everybody.

08:48.778 --> 08:50.238
I ain't frontin', T.

08:51.781 --> 08:52.949
Will you help me?

09:10.967 --> 09:11.968
Open.

09:15.513 --> 09:16.514
Close.

09:20.310 --> 09:21.519
Lift.

09:37.994 --> 09:42.457
For what this thing costs, it better do
more than just help me drink coffee.

09:42.540 --> 09:45.543
I know this seems silly,
but the arm is being programmed

09:45.627 --> 09:48.755
to respond to the remaining nerve endings
in your limb.

09:48.838 --> 09:52.509
The muscles flex and send a signal
to the prosthetic to respond accordingly.

09:57.806 --> 10:01.643
It's not as simple as linking a cell phone
to your car with Bluetooth.

10:02.352 --> 10:04.896
It takes some time before it clicks.
Trust me.

10:27.085 --> 10:28.294
- <i>Hey, Foggy.</i>
- Hey.

10:28.378 --> 10:30.505
I got a possible cash flow solution.

10:30.588 --> 10:33.049
A high-end personal appearance gig.
Easy money.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.469
I won't do porn. Or escort.

10:36.553 --> 10:39.931
Relax, gigolo.
The call was for a personal appearance.

10:40.014 --> 10:42.934
Selfies, handshakes,
maybe lift something heavy.

10:43.017 --> 10:45.270
Oh, so now I'm Joe Louis
greeting people at the casino?

10:46.187 --> 10:48.523
Stop being such a baby.

10:48.606 --> 10:50.817
Do you know how much BeyoncÃ© got paid

10:50.900 --> 10:54.028
to do a bar mitzvah with Destiny's Child
a decade ago?

10:54.112 --> 10:56.781
<i>A lawyer I clerked for in law school
brokered the deal.</i>

11:00.076 --> 11:01.995
Uh, let me call you back.

11:05.623 --> 11:06.916
Hey.

11:08.751 --> 11:09.836
Nice upgrade.

11:12.255 --> 11:13.256
Thanks.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.217
Danny and Colleen hooked me up.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.345
Oh. Seriously, it looks good.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.432
It's, uh... it's badass.

11:24.601 --> 11:26.311
What, you're sleeping here now?

11:26.394 --> 11:29.022
Well, we still got a few weeks left
on the lease,

11:29.105 --> 11:31.065
unless I can get the landlord
to change his mind.

11:31.149 --> 11:33.109
- Hmm.
- But it'll do for now.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.200
What'd the guy from ICE lockup
have to say?

11:42.160 --> 11:45.538
Oh. You know,
just that Bushmaster's whole deal

11:45.622 --> 11:48.166
is Mariah and getting revenge on her.

11:48.249 --> 11:51.210
- He hasn't popped up anywhere else?
- Guy's a ghost.

11:51.294 --> 11:52.795
Not with Mariah's guns.

11:52.879 --> 11:55.006
He's gonna turn people
into ghosts in a minute.

11:55.089 --> 11:58.760
If his whole beef is with Mariah,
why buy guns from her?

11:59.802 --> 12:03.640
Who knows? It's not like I don't have
other problems to deal with.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.225
Take a look.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.605
Cockroach is suing you?

12:10.688 --> 12:13.107
Yeah, "Dontrell."

12:13.191 --> 12:16.486
If I don't come up with 100 grand,
I have to go to court.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.405
Are you really gonna pay that?
I mean, can you pay that?

12:19.489 --> 12:20.907
I don't have a choice.

12:21.574 --> 12:24.202
I feel like part of this is on me.

12:24.285 --> 12:27.163
You know Scarfe and I locked up Cockroach
back in the day.

12:27.246 --> 12:30.166
- Scarfe?
- Yeah. That's part of why he's out.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.711
It's one of Scarfe's tainted cases.

12:33.795 --> 12:35.380
Scarfe's mess.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.256
Now it's mine.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.926
No. It's mine, too.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.594
I'm gonna make it right.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.013
You know...

12:45.306 --> 12:47.308
you could always call Danny.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.479
No.

12:51.562 --> 12:53.314
I got myself into this mess.

13:01.572 --> 13:03.032
I'll get myself out.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.285
<i>I have to be real with you.</i>

13:06.369 --> 13:09.205
That viral footage
of you getting knocked out,

13:09.288 --> 13:11.124
it's not very inspiring.

13:11.207 --> 13:14.377
<i>That's what sells shoes. Inspiration.</i>

13:14.460 --> 13:17.130
Coach Bowles said it was
the best workout he's ever seen.

13:17.213 --> 13:20.216
World-class speed. I watched it, too.

13:20.299 --> 13:23.845
You could blow through an offensive line
like wind through a pile of leaves, but...

13:24.429 --> 13:25.430
But what?

13:27.140 --> 13:30.518
You weren't born with your powers.
They were given to you.

13:30.601 --> 13:33.855
Now, either every team in the league
gets to have someone enhanced like you

13:33.938 --> 13:34.772
or no one does.

13:34.856 --> 13:37.567
<i>There's no way
the commish would let that happen.</i>

13:37.650 --> 13:39.861
<i>It's a documentary series.</i>

13:39.944 --> 13:42.697
<i>We're calling it </i> Bulletproof vs. Beast.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.782
<i>Have you clicked the link yet?</i>

13:55.251 --> 13:57.754
- You want me to fight a shark?
<i>- Well...</i>

13:57.837 --> 13:59.589
<i>yeah!</i>

13:59.672 --> 14:01.632
<i>But we'll save that for the season finale.</i>

14:01.716 --> 14:04.093
<i>Uh, we'll start you
with something smaller first.</i>

14:04.177 --> 14:05.970
<i>Like a... a honey badger.</i>

14:06.054 --> 14:07.638
<i>You can take a honey badger, right?</i>

14:09.766 --> 14:12.185
Uh, just one second.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.611
Hey, Foggy. It's me.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.238
How much did BeyoncÃ© make again?

14:26.657 --> 14:28.951
Press arriving already.
We're off to a good start.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.661
They're scouting for the ceremony.

14:30.745 --> 14:34.040
Thembi Wallace's people called.
She'll want a formal sit-down after.

14:34.123 --> 14:38.044
That bitch can sit down on her ass
and wait like everybody else.

14:38.127 --> 14:39.462
That formal enough for ya?

14:39.545 --> 14:43.049
Play nice, Madam Councilwoman.
Everyone loves a comeback story.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.843
Just make sure it's live.
I don't wanna get buried by Kimmel.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.096
Did Tilda go for it?

14:49.972 --> 14:50.973
I don't know.

14:51.641 --> 14:53.059
That offer is real.

14:53.684 --> 14:56.145
I would love to announce it tonight.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.147
I already have a business to run.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.941
And it's lovely.

15:00.024 --> 15:02.944
But you can hardly keep
the lights on in that place.

15:03.027 --> 15:04.904
But it's mine.

15:04.987 --> 15:08.699
I built it from the ground up.
That's more than you can say.

15:09.700 --> 15:13.121
I'm sorry, Mommy.
Trusting you is new to me.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.875
Harlem's finest.

15:19.085 --> 15:21.838
We Be Donuts has opened up
on Frederick Douglass.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.006
- Y'all want directions?
- No.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.550
Maybe we'll stop on the way back.

15:26.175 --> 15:28.428
No, we're actually here looking
for a friend of yours.

15:30.513 --> 15:32.557
Do you think you could help us locate him?

15:32.640 --> 15:35.977
He was at my fundraiser.
He's one of my biggest donors.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.564
He's probably at home
with his wife, Cindy.

15:39.647 --> 15:40.857
She's my soror.

15:40.940 --> 15:45.403
Well, she hasn't seen him.
No one has. Not for a few days.

15:45.486 --> 15:49.657
I barely talked to him that night.
I mean, who had the time?

15:50.324 --> 15:52.827
If you do see him,
can you give us a call?

16:00.710 --> 16:01.919
You telling me you got nothing?

16:03.296 --> 16:06.841
No Stylers, no Bushmaster.
We checked everywhere.

16:07.967 --> 16:08.968
Except Kingston.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.139
You think this is a joke?

16:13.806 --> 16:14.807
No.

16:16.851 --> 16:19.520
But if you're worried about an ambush,
why sell 'em all our guns?

16:20.146 --> 16:22.690
"Why" isn't what you guys do.

16:22.773 --> 16:26.319
You guys do "yes" and "it's done."

16:27.028 --> 16:29.363
I didn't pay you all for your opinions.

16:29.447 --> 16:33.659
Stop worrying about what we're doing
and keep looking for Bushmaster.

16:35.119 --> 16:37.288
Where the hell is Ray Ray?

16:38.581 --> 16:39.582
Ray ain't show.

16:40.708 --> 16:43.419
- What do you mean he ain't show?
- Like I said.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.797
I talked to Coco.
She ain't seen him either.

16:58.184 --> 17:02.730
- We need to get you out of town.
- I agree. Paris, Milan.

17:02.813 --> 17:05.273
That's not what I'm talking about
and you know it.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.734
Bushmaster all but threatened you
when he came up here.

17:07.818 --> 17:09.319
Ooh, whatever.

17:09.904 --> 17:11.071
He was spooky.

17:11.155 --> 17:14.200
But his money is green.
The merger was golden.

17:14.282 --> 17:15.535
We have no problems.

17:15.617 --> 17:18.329
But if there's more blood on the streets
because of our guns...

17:18.412 --> 17:20.623
There will always be
blood in the streets, baby.

17:20.705 --> 17:21.707
That's Harlem.

17:21.790 --> 17:24.042
We are about to be untouchable.

17:24.126 --> 17:27.797
With my Family First Initiative
and my buildings...

17:28.381 --> 17:30.424
my legacy is protected.

17:31.926 --> 17:34.428
Maybe it's time for you
to start thinking about yours.

17:36.222 --> 17:37.515
I agree.

17:39.809 --> 17:40.977
My legacy...

17:42.186 --> 17:43.312
is right here.

17:46.482 --> 17:47.858
Harlem's Paradise.

17:49.652 --> 17:52.697
I want to use some of my share
and buy it from you outright.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.574
Title and all.

17:55.908 --> 18:01.122
This place is the only thing left
that ties you to the life.

18:01.831 --> 18:03.082
You really want out?

18:04.709 --> 18:05.710
Sell it.

18:06.586 --> 18:07.587
To me.

18:10.673 --> 18:11.674
No.

18:12.925 --> 18:13.968
Not right now.

18:19.765 --> 18:20.850
You pissed?

18:21.934 --> 18:23.144
Where are you going?

18:25.396 --> 18:30.192
Your friend Piranha's having
some kind of party at his office tonight.

18:30.276 --> 18:33.112
And you know how reckless
that idiot is when he gets drunk.

18:34.030 --> 18:36.324
I'm gonna go make sure
he doesn't mess up our Atreus deal

18:36.407 --> 18:39.535
by doing or saying
something stupid that gets out.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.038
I've been knowing that boy
since he was 12 years old.

18:42.121 --> 18:45.916
He works hard, parties hard,
but he's fine.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.835
Yeah, well, I don't trust him.

18:47.918 --> 18:49.378
You don't trust anybody.

18:51.672 --> 18:52.757
I trust you.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.263
Those detectives,

18:59.347 --> 19:03.142
Bailey and yellow gal
that dips in and out of the club.

19:03.225 --> 19:05.394
They rolled up
on the complex this morning.

19:06.228 --> 19:08.522
Mark Higgins is missing.

19:10.316 --> 19:11.692
Do you know anything about it?

19:13.486 --> 19:14.487
Of course not.

19:16.030 --> 19:17.365
Should we be worried?

19:19.283 --> 19:22.244
No. For once, we ain't do shit.

19:26.582 --> 19:28.209
I'll see you later tonight.

19:36.133 --> 19:37.343
A'ight.

20:08.165 --> 20:09.291
You gonna get that?

20:17.758 --> 20:20.594
You know, you could
answer the door your damn self

20:20.678 --> 20:22.722
if you weren't faking your injuries.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.974
Ain't nobody faking shit.

20:28.227 --> 20:31.897
Now that cheap-ass
Tin-Man-from-<i>The-Wiz-</i> looking bullshit

20:31.981 --> 20:33.899
you got where your arm used to be...

20:34.525 --> 20:37.027
You need to drop
that lawsuit against Luke.

20:37.111 --> 20:41.031
Or what? You gonna find you
another super to do your dirty work

20:41.115 --> 20:42.742
now that Scarfe ain't here to help you?

20:42.825 --> 20:44.493
Limp carefully, snitch.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.370
I ain't limping nowhere, pig.

20:47.413 --> 20:51.250
Shit. It was the happiest day of my life
when I found out Scarfe got his.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.251
Matter of fact,

20:52.334 --> 20:54.336
I was gonna have Drea
take me down to the cemetery,

20:54.420 --> 20:55.713
piss on his grave.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.007
Oh.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.800
Do your thing, Robocop.

20:59.884 --> 21:02.595
Drea, get out the phone.
Let's get this on tape.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.972
Let's get all Black Lives Matters
on her ass.

21:05.055 --> 21:08.225
- You are a piece of shit.
- And you're easily flustered.

21:08.976 --> 21:12.229
My bad. Blue Lives Matter.
I was just joking about the cemetery.

21:12.313 --> 21:15.691
I'm gonna leave some flowers.
Some dead ones.

21:18.319 --> 21:20.696
We just letting cops in the house now?

21:20.780 --> 21:23.365
Sit your ass down. You on time out.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.042
Hi there. We're here to see...

21:33.125 --> 21:36.003
Oh, Mr. Cage. Mr. Nelson.
Mr. Jones has been expecting you.

21:36.086 --> 21:38.380
Can I get you anything while you wait?
A cappuccino?

21:38.464 --> 21:39.465
We're fine.

21:43.511 --> 21:45.554
Hi. Your 3:30 is here.

21:46.931 --> 21:49.767
- You know anything about this guy?
- Yeah, he does stocks.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.645
Speculation. You know, stuff like that.

21:55.231 --> 21:56.899
Hey, if I knew more about money,

21:56.982 --> 21:59.610
I wouldn't have five figures
in student loans, right?

22:00.820 --> 22:03.364
Oh. And everyone calls him Piranha.

22:04.782 --> 22:05.699
Piranha?

22:05.783 --> 22:07.618
Maybe he's a good swimmer.

22:07.701 --> 22:09.370
Mr. Jones is just finishing up a meeting.

22:09.453 --> 22:11.247
But he's asked
if you'd wait in his office.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.331
Right this way.

22:47.116 --> 22:49.076
Sweet sister.

22:49.159 --> 22:50.536
Is that what I think it is?

22:51.370 --> 22:54.123
Well, it took me a hell of a long time
to find that.

22:54.206 --> 22:55.541
Wasn't exactly cheap, either.

22:55.624 --> 22:56.667
Well, you got ripped off.

22:58.168 --> 23:00.254
The uniforms at Seagate are orange.

23:00.337 --> 23:03.674
But if you get charged,
they'll give you one for free.

23:03.757 --> 23:06.218
Uh, funny.

23:06.302 --> 23:09.847
Raymond Jones.
But you can call me Piranha.

23:10.431 --> 23:11.557
Everyone does.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.268
Now, come on, be honest.
Tell me what you think.

23:14.351 --> 23:17.730
I call this my Luke Cage Hall of Fame.

23:18.439 --> 23:19.440
Honestly?

23:20.566 --> 23:21.567
It's creepy.

23:22.151 --> 23:24.737
In a good way.
That's what he means.

23:25.613 --> 23:27.990
Oh, hell, I'm just excited you're here.

23:28.073 --> 23:30.075
I mean, Luke Cage.
In my office.

23:30.159 --> 23:33.120
Man, I... Look.
I'm a big fan. Might even be your biggest.

23:34.455 --> 23:37.791
You got shot with those.
At Crispus Attucks, huh?

23:38.959 --> 23:40.044
How did you get them?

23:40.127 --> 23:42.796
Man, every time you do your thing,
it's eBay paradise.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.424
Instant collectibles. You want one?

23:46.342 --> 23:47.551
I'm good.

23:47.635 --> 23:51.096
Besides, it's, uh, a little early.

23:51.972 --> 23:54.266
Well, it's ten o'clock
somewhere in the world.

23:54.350 --> 23:55.851
Why not start early?

23:57.770 --> 23:58.771
Have a seat.

24:01.148 --> 24:04.109
Figured with everything that I heard,
all positive of course,

24:04.193 --> 24:05.611
your office would be on Wall Street.

24:06.195 --> 24:08.572
Man, I'm from Harlem,
and Clinton made it hot again.

24:08.656 --> 24:10.866
See that book on my desk right there?

24:10.949 --> 24:12.660
That's my motto.

24:12.743 --> 24:15.371
That book is the only thing
I have left of my father.

24:16.622 --> 24:20.626
Father didn't realize it, but he's the one
who got me started on my path.

24:20.709 --> 24:24.171
- Did he give you good advice?
- No, he didn't.

24:25.047 --> 24:28.801
My first office was at Blimpie's
on 125th and MLK.

24:28.884 --> 24:30.010
For the free Wi-Fi.

24:30.094 --> 24:33.889
I went from taking copies of
<i>Black Enterprise</i> from my dentist's office

24:33.972 --> 24:35.724
to having a crib and an office

24:35.808 --> 24:38.310
bigger than anything
Earl Graves could ever dream of.

24:41.897 --> 24:44.733
- Why do they call you Piranha?
- Oh.

24:44.817 --> 24:48.487
Well, Wall Street
is full of great white sharks.

24:48.570 --> 24:52.282
So no one sees a piranha coming.
They're small, tenacious.

24:52.366 --> 24:54.576
So, sometimes you want to stay small.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.787
Then other times you wanna play it large!

24:56.870 --> 24:59.123
That's what tonight is all about,
baby.

24:59.206 --> 25:02.418
We went and hit it big
with this Atreus Plastics merger

25:02.501 --> 25:03.877
and I'm throwing a celebration.

25:03.961 --> 25:05.212
I want to do something special.

25:05.295 --> 25:09.007
Now, anybody can go and get a DJ.
Trust me, you know I know 'em.

25:09.091 --> 25:12.886
You know, D-Nice, Flex,
Mark Ronson.

25:12.970 --> 25:17.933
But a celebrity superhero,
that's some next-level shit right there.

25:19.935 --> 25:23.689
It's just taking pictures
and shaking hands, right?

25:24.273 --> 25:27.317
That's it.
And you'll be well rewarded for your time.

25:28.068 --> 25:30.195
- How much?
- How much you want?

25:30.279 --> 25:36.869
- Our fee is 50...
- What my partner means is $150,000.

25:36.952 --> 25:38.787
One-fifty? Sounds good.

25:38.871 --> 25:41.790
One-fifty? I should be your client.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.959
If you're gonna sell out,
might as well get paid.

25:44.835 --> 25:45.961
What are you not telling me?

25:46.044 --> 25:48.714
I saw a picture of him and Mariah Dillard.

25:48.797 --> 25:51.884
Somehow,
I am exactly where I'm supposed to be.

25:51.967 --> 25:54.553
You're in enough trouble
fighting crime without a mask.

25:55.137 --> 25:57.723
I'm nobody's pet for pay.
Forget that shit.

25:57.806 --> 26:00.768
Look, it's one night.

26:00.851 --> 26:03.937
One night and you can put
this entire lawsuit behind you.

26:04.688 --> 26:05.689
One night.

26:06.857 --> 26:09.777
Mr. Cage, Mr. Jones would like you
to wear this tonight.

26:16.492 --> 26:17.576
I'm not wearing that.

26:17.659 --> 26:20.496
He said you'd say that.
It's in your contract.

26:25.459 --> 26:28.670
See, I told you. This is a bad idea.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.092
You heard anything from Ray Ray?

26:34.176 --> 26:35.803
He isn't answering his phone.

26:37.304 --> 26:39.515
Everything all right up there
with you and your lady?

26:39.598 --> 26:42.434
Thought you guys would be banging
on a bed of $100 bills or some shit.

26:43.894 --> 26:45.145
I'm joking, B.

26:45.229 --> 26:47.064
You think Ray Ray is talking to the cops?

26:48.148 --> 26:49.233
Nah, bro.

26:50.275 --> 26:54.321
Ray Ray's a rock.
He's built for this. Forever.

26:54.404 --> 26:55.948
Then why ain't he calling?

26:56.573 --> 26:59.993
When have you known Double Ray
not to show? Or at least call?

27:01.078 --> 27:04.122
Kiki got shot and Ray still held it down
and made his pickups.

27:04.206 --> 27:06.834
- Kid's like clockwork.
- Maybe he's in love.

27:06.917 --> 27:10.087
I mean, you ain't been the most
communicative person lately either.

27:13.048 --> 27:14.258
I need you to find him.

27:15.551 --> 27:16.677
Can you do that for me?

27:17.886 --> 27:18.887
I'm on it.

27:22.516 --> 27:23.559
I'm doing it solo?

27:24.601 --> 27:25.853
You ain't coming with me?

27:28.730 --> 27:30.148
I have to go to a party.

27:30.232 --> 27:31.942
The life of the 1%.

27:33.610 --> 27:35.571
Tell Jay and Puff I said, "What up?"

28:40.761 --> 28:44.014
I ain't do shit. I know my rights, man.

28:46.391 --> 28:48.560
Go tell it on a mountain, homie.

28:52.189 --> 28:53.732
Still no gun.

28:54.942 --> 28:58.153
Well, it's in here somewhere.
Just gotta sniff it out.

28:59.321 --> 29:01.573
You ain't gonna find no gun,
'cause there ain't no gun.

29:01.657 --> 29:02.741
Shut up, Dontrell.

29:02.824 --> 29:04.743
"Cockroach." Get it right.

29:05.327 --> 29:07.246
So you prefer to be called Cockroach?

29:07.955 --> 29:08.956
Yeah.

29:10.165 --> 29:11.166
Okay.

29:15.796 --> 29:18.382
I looked everywhere. It ain't here.

29:18.465 --> 29:21.551
Just slow down. Open your eyes.
Take in the room.

29:21.635 --> 29:22.844
I did all that.

29:22.928 --> 29:25.389
All right. Let me take a look.

29:26.014 --> 29:27.099
Don't take it personal.

29:27.182 --> 29:29.518
My eyes are softer than yours
by at least 12 years.

29:29.601 --> 29:30.644
I'll take a look.

29:35.732 --> 29:37.317
Oh.

29:37.401 --> 29:38.986
You's a fine bitch, you know that?

29:39.569 --> 29:43.323
Yeah. Anybody ever tell you
you too bad to be a cop?

29:44.199 --> 29:46.868
You need to use them hips
for something better, Ma.

29:46.952 --> 29:47.953
I could help with that.

29:48.036 --> 29:50.289
You need to shut your mouth.

29:52.124 --> 29:53.875
Y'all ain't got shit, man.

29:53.959 --> 29:57.129
No shit, or, "Aw, shit"?

29:57.212 --> 29:58.839
Aw, shit.

29:59.464 --> 30:00.674
No, that's not mine.

30:00.757 --> 30:03.719
You got 38 problems and a bitch ain't one.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.846
That's not my gun.

30:05.929 --> 30:06.888
Where'd you find it?

30:06.972 --> 30:09.308
Homie had it stashed behind the headboard.

30:09.391 --> 30:11.810
Officers, please escort Mr. Roach
to his new motel.

30:11.893 --> 30:14.313
Hold up! That's not mine!
Get your hands off me!

30:14.396 --> 30:16.231
- Yo, that's not mine!
- Bye-bye.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.817
That's not mine. Somebody put that there.

30:27.159 --> 30:28.410
You were right.

30:30.203 --> 30:31.621
Told ya we'd sniff it out.

30:36.084 --> 30:37.544
Detective Knight...

30:38.712 --> 30:41.131
I thought you were told
to stay away from those cases.

30:41.715 --> 30:43.925
What if Cockroach was telling the truth?

30:45.260 --> 30:48.472
What if Scarfe planted that gun?

30:53.310 --> 30:56.188
It's not the cleanest collection
of evidence I've ever seen.

30:56.271 --> 30:57.689
So you read the file?

30:57.773 --> 30:59.691
I read through all the cases
that bounced back,

30:59.775 --> 31:01.485
but there's nothing I can do.

31:01.568 --> 31:02.486
It's the past.

31:02.569 --> 31:06.990
But it's not the past.
It's walking around, now, free.

31:08.742 --> 31:10.619
You had an eyewitness on Dontrell.

31:10.702 --> 31:13.288
When you brought him in,
he tested positive for GSR.

31:13.372 --> 31:15.874
You guys might not have needed
the gun to bust him.

31:15.957 --> 31:21.421
Even if Cockroach was guilty,
doesn't mean all of them were.

31:22.214 --> 31:23.757
I thought it was just Cottonmouth,

31:23.840 --> 31:25.759
but Scarfe could have been
doing this for years.

31:25.842 --> 31:28.011
I mean, who knows
what else he was running?

31:28.095 --> 31:29.012
Maybe.

31:29.096 --> 31:32.933
Maybe it was just Cottonmouth.
You'll never know. None of us will.

31:33.600 --> 31:36.895
We all just have to find a way
to live with what's happened.

31:59.042 --> 32:00.168
Detective Knight.

32:01.128 --> 32:03.296
Hey. Sure.

32:35.537 --> 32:37.747
Goddamn cosplay.

32:38.331 --> 32:39.332
Shit.

33:26.046 --> 33:28.089
Is that Ghostface Killah?

33:28.757 --> 33:31.635
Yeah. Method Man wrote a song about me.

33:32.344 --> 33:33.678
We kick it from time to time.

33:34.262 --> 33:36.097
I gotta get superpowers.

34:03.124 --> 34:04.334
Yo, Luke Cage!

34:05.418 --> 34:08.463
Luke! Welcome to the party, baby!

34:09.505 --> 34:13.051
Hey, man. I gotta admit, this party's
a little bigger than I thought.

34:13.134 --> 34:16.137
This? This ain't shit.
Come on, let's do a lap.

34:18.223 --> 34:19.306
It's cool.

34:19.391 --> 34:22.143
I'll be here, just hanging.

34:22.226 --> 34:24.603
Hey, how's it going?

34:24.688 --> 34:25.563
No?

34:26.273 --> 34:30.235
Yo! Yo! Oh! RJ, what up, boy?
You finally made it, huh?

34:30.944 --> 34:32.696
Oh, is this your wife?

34:32.779 --> 34:34.322
Just playing.

34:36.032 --> 34:38.784
Uh, is there something
I'm supposed to be doing?

34:38.868 --> 34:41.788
You're already doing it. Look, Luke.
But you gotta put that hood up.

34:41.871 --> 34:43.915
Put the hoodie up, man.
That shit is iconic.

34:44.583 --> 34:47.418
Come on, do it! Do it! There it is!

34:47.502 --> 34:50.463
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yo, get it. Get it.

34:50.547 --> 34:51.922
You want me to talk to him?

34:52.007 --> 34:53.341
- Thanks.
- I'll talk to him.

34:56.636 --> 34:58.096
You the man, Luke.

34:58.179 --> 35:00.348
Hey. Uh, how much can you bench?

35:00.432 --> 35:02.684
Who's tougher, you or the green monster?

35:02.767 --> 35:03.977
That's not his name.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.855
Oh, shit!

35:12.235 --> 35:13.570
You guys getting this?

35:13.653 --> 35:15.530
Yeah. Stay right there.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.491
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no.

35:22.037 --> 35:23.413
Peterson, you are an animal.

35:23.496 --> 35:24.998
That was insane.

35:25.081 --> 35:27.417
- Oh, my God!
- You gotta text me that.

35:27.500 --> 35:29.044
Yeah, man, I got you.

35:41.181 --> 35:42.223
Who called you?

35:43.058 --> 35:44.517
I've got people who call me

35:44.601 --> 35:48.104
when someone slips by accident
into someone's fist.

35:48.188 --> 35:50.815
- That supposed to be a joke?
- No.

35:51.816 --> 35:54.110
There's nothing funny
about what he's done to you.

35:54.194 --> 35:57.906
We can find him now and press charges.

35:57.989 --> 35:59.240
It really was an accident.

35:59.324 --> 36:03.620
What? He accidentally hit you
in the eye with a jab

36:03.703 --> 36:05.455
instead of an uppercut to the chin?

36:07.874 --> 36:11.252
Cockroach will keep doing this
until he kills you.

36:12.087 --> 36:13.463
Or your son.

36:14.089 --> 36:17.467
'Cause that's who he is.
He's not gonna change.

36:19.135 --> 36:22.639
Do you have any idea
how many bodies I've stood over

36:22.722 --> 36:25.141
of people in your exact position?

36:26.059 --> 36:29.020
It haunts me to this day.

36:30.313 --> 36:31.690
Give me something.

36:32.899 --> 36:34.234
Anything.

36:36.111 --> 36:38.113
Is there something illegal
in your apartment?

36:38.196 --> 36:40.281
Guns? Drugs?

36:40.365 --> 36:43.535
I can have a warrant in an hour
and have him locked up in three.

36:43.618 --> 36:47.288
- But you gotta say something.
- And what can you really do, huh?

36:47.372 --> 36:51.876
You got him before and he still got out.
And not for knocking me around.

36:51.960 --> 36:56.589
And even if he didn't kill that guy
that your partner framed him for,

36:56.673 --> 36:58.466
he's killed others.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.176
Plenty others.

37:01.302 --> 37:06.599
So, yeah, I'm not talking,
'cause I'm scared of him and because...

37:08.393 --> 37:10.687
I don't think there's shit
you can do to stop him.

37:14.899 --> 37:17.652
How many were we up against?
About ten, 20? Right?

37:17.736 --> 37:19.571
These guys are big,
but my guy's bulletproof,

37:19.654 --> 37:21.948
so I ain't worried about him.
I got to come out blasting.

37:22.031 --> 37:23.908
Bam, bam, bam!
Fools droppin' left and right.

37:23.992 --> 37:25.493
Yo, where's my man, Luke-dawg?

37:25.577 --> 37:28.246
Sitting there, chilling,
listening to Wu-Tang in his iPhone.

37:28.329 --> 37:31.916
You know what I'm sayin'? 'Cause it's
just another night kicking ass.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.794
The gruesome twosome,
right, baby?

37:36.379 --> 37:38.548
Y'all don't understand
a damn thing I'm saying, do you?

37:39.424 --> 37:41.217
Well, do you like wine? <i> Vino?</i>

37:41.301 --> 37:46.055
I just bought a vineyard in Napa. I've got
a chardonnay that'll melt your face off.

37:46.139 --> 37:48.141
Matter of fact, come on, ladies.

37:53.396 --> 37:54.981
Come on, Luke.

37:55.064 --> 37:57.150
Ain't shit over there. Come on.

38:00.361 --> 38:02.489
Ladies, ladies...

38:06.117 --> 38:09.871
Uh, watch the stairs. You know, make sure
our wine tasting is not interrupted.

38:09.954 --> 38:10.997
Oh.

38:11.080 --> 38:14.876
I'm your doorman now?
What? Pet nigga isn't good enough for you?

38:14.959 --> 38:16.795
Why you getting all political and shit?

38:16.878 --> 38:19.547
Just do your job.
Luke, you almost done, baby.

38:19.631 --> 38:22.550
Oh, and don't let nobody else up.
Unless they hotter than these two.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.585
You're not gonna change?

39:00.421 --> 39:01.756
That's because I'm not going.

39:03.842 --> 39:06.928
You lied to those cops. You lied to me.

39:07.679 --> 39:09.556
You had more than a few words
with Mark Higgins.

39:09.639 --> 39:12.183
He stood right here in your office
when you introduced us.

39:12.267 --> 39:15.019
That's private.
They didn't need to know about it.

39:15.103 --> 39:18.273
What about me?
You keep saying that we're family.

39:18.857 --> 39:23.069
Tell me everything now
or nothing, and I'll walk away for good.

39:24.529 --> 39:26.030
I can live with that.

39:27.782 --> 39:29.576
I was doing fine without you.

39:30.410 --> 39:31.411
Fine.

39:32.036 --> 39:34.414
<i>I blackmailed Mark Higgins.</i>

39:34.497 --> 39:39.627
A few weeks ago, I had got word
that Atreus Plastics was offered a merger.

39:39.711 --> 39:41.546
It was information no one else had.

39:42.505 --> 39:45.466
Mark Higgins was the only thing
standing in the way.

39:46.092 --> 39:47.093
Insider trading.

39:47.176 --> 39:51.389
Mark Higgins is a sack of shit
that never put a dime into the community.

39:51.472 --> 39:53.850
And he let his dick control him.

39:55.560 --> 39:59.272
<i>Stephanie was his server...
in more ways than one.</i>

40:00.899 --> 40:02.483
I videotaped it.

40:02.567 --> 40:06.237
I merely conveyed
that information to Mr. Higgins

40:06.321 --> 40:08.573
so he could make the appropriate decision.

40:09.490 --> 40:13.953
We made hundreds of millions of dollars
when he voted to approve the merger.

40:14.037 --> 40:16.122
The stock was purchased legally

40:16.831 --> 40:21.210
with money that I used
from selling off the family gun business.

40:21.294 --> 40:25.089
A $20 million investment
could be worth billions.

40:25.673 --> 40:29.093
Guns? That's where our money
really comes from?

40:29.177 --> 40:32.472
Back in the day, dice and coochie.

40:33.306 --> 40:35.600
Then guns. Never drugs.

40:36.392 --> 40:39.270
- And you're okay with that?
- Uh, abso-damn-lutely.

40:40.271 --> 40:42.190
You play it forward.

40:42.273 --> 40:45.860
Your great-grandmother
was a ghetto philanthropist.

40:45.944 --> 40:49.781
Your cousin Cornell
financed all of my campaigns.

40:49.864 --> 40:53.242
Now, I am a legit philanthropist.

40:53.326 --> 40:54.786
That's the American way, girl.

40:54.869 --> 40:58.164
- You are a crook and a liar.
- I serve Harlem.

40:58.247 --> 41:01.417
And, yes, I will do whatever it takes.

41:01.501 --> 41:04.837
Your profession
is not too pristine, my dear.

41:05.630 --> 41:09.634
You never took money from a shady
pharmaceutical company for a greater good?

41:09.717 --> 41:12.470
That's why my medicine
comes from the ground.

41:12.553 --> 41:13.930
To do no harm.

41:14.013 --> 41:17.642
It's better to do a little harm
for a whole lot of good

41:17.725 --> 41:20.937
than it is to do no harm for jack shit.

41:21.020 --> 41:23.690
Without that money,
there's no Shirley Chisholm Complex,

41:23.773 --> 41:25.608
no Family First Initiative.

41:27.151 --> 41:29.570
You wanted the truth. There it is.

41:29.654 --> 41:33.408
You want it clean?
Help me clean it up.

41:34.534 --> 41:37.620
You're the healer. Heal this.

41:40.581 --> 41:41.916
Where is Mark Higgins?

41:42.000 --> 41:44.836
I haven't seen him
since he left here that night.

41:45.503 --> 41:47.547
And that's the truth also.

41:48.339 --> 41:51.592
You can't plant a seed
without getting your hands dirty.

41:51.676 --> 41:55.555
The seeds have been planted.
They've been watered.

41:55.638 --> 41:58.266
I'm done with the dirt.
Tilda, I washed my hands.

41:58.349 --> 42:02.145
I want you with me
when we reap the harvest

42:02.228 --> 42:04.355
and Harlem rises again.

42:38.389 --> 42:39.432
You okay?

42:40.141 --> 42:44.103
It's just that you're
a big deal. A real hero.

42:44.854 --> 42:49.734
My father, my uncles, my little brother,
they all look up to you.

42:53.488 --> 42:55.948
- You want a picture?
- Would you mind?

42:57.366 --> 42:59.285
- Sure.
- Okay.

43:03.539 --> 43:05.374
Thank you.

43:13.299 --> 43:14.592
Oh, hey!

43:19.889 --> 43:21.390
The hell is that file?

43:32.527 --> 43:36.030
It's in Nandi's desk.
Should still be my desk.

44:38.301 --> 44:39.343
Mmm-mmm.

44:40.970 --> 44:42.054
What's the matter?

44:44.599 --> 44:46.809
You're still worried
about that Haverland thing, huh?

44:46.893 --> 44:48.019
Hell, yeah.

44:48.853 --> 44:52.940
That asshole is scamming little old ladies
out of their social checks.

44:53.524 --> 44:57.445
I know it. I just can't prove it.

45:01.699 --> 45:06.287
Haverland is smart, all right?
So, what you gotta do...

45:07.997 --> 45:11.208
you gotta figure out how you're gonna
be smarter. Put a pin in this dude.

45:11.292 --> 45:13.377
- I might have a solution.
- Yeah?

45:13.461 --> 45:17.673
You know, uh, Meg?
Sits behind the desk in evidence room?

45:17.757 --> 45:19.216
- Big Leg Meg?
- Mmm-hmm.

45:19.300 --> 45:21.844
She's in and out of that room
every ten minutes to go smoke.

45:22.970 --> 45:27.391
So all we gotta do, wait outside,
she comes out, we go in, head in the back,

45:27.475 --> 45:30.061
grab three, four ounces of blow,
H, whatever.

45:31.062 --> 45:34.440
We'll put the tail on Haverland,
pull his ass over...

45:34.523 --> 45:37.443
"License and registration." "Sure..."
"Ooh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

45:37.526 --> 45:39.487
What's that on the backseat?

45:39.570 --> 45:41.989
Step out of the car, sir.
You're under arrest."

45:42.073 --> 45:45.326
Next thing you know, he's on all fours,
begging for his mommy in Rikers.

45:46.911 --> 45:49.705
It ain't a set-up if he's guilty.
And you said it, he's guilty.

45:59.173 --> 46:01.300
You are such an asshole.

46:01.384 --> 46:03.803
I had you.

46:03.886 --> 46:06.222
Why you so gullible?
You gotta work on that.

46:06.305 --> 46:07.598
Yeah, I do.

46:10.643 --> 46:12.853
- Tell you what.
- What?

46:12.937 --> 46:15.106
Be nice if it was that easy,
though, wouldn't it?

46:15.189 --> 46:19.819
This thing works one way.
The letter of the law, no.

46:19.902 --> 46:22.947
Mmm-hmm. That's right.
That's just the way I taught ya.

46:23.030 --> 46:24.740
- Right.
- Very good, Officer.

46:25.366 --> 46:27.410
I needed that.

46:27.994 --> 46:30.079
You wanna grab another one
down at the Lenox Lounge?

46:30.162 --> 46:32.832
- Nah. Gotta get home and see Earl.
- Big plans?

46:32.915 --> 46:37.294
I told him he could wait up,
watch the Mets game with me.

46:37.378 --> 46:39.922
That sounds great
except for the Mets part.

46:40.006 --> 46:43.634
Hmm. Spoken like a true,
sad and sorry-ass Yankee fan.

46:43.718 --> 46:45.678
- Yeah, but we win.
- Mmm-mmm.

46:45.761 --> 46:47.346
You lose.

46:50.599 --> 46:52.935
- Night, partner.
- Catch you when I catch you.

48:25.528 --> 48:29.448
I gave you a week to get me what I need.
The clock is ticking.

48:29.532 --> 48:31.325
You're too late. Mariah's gone legit.

48:31.909 --> 48:34.495
You're just protecting
your homeboy Shades.

48:34.578 --> 48:35.955
Look, I got nothing.

48:36.872 --> 48:38.999
Why don't you just lean
on the other guy you pinched?

48:39.083 --> 48:40.751
- He'll talk eventually.
- Who?

48:40.835 --> 48:42.503
Ray Ray.

48:42.586 --> 48:45.422
Ray Ray? Who the hell is Ray Ray?

49:33.846 --> 49:34.722
Hey.

49:35.681 --> 49:37.433
It wasn't an accident.

49:37.516 --> 49:41.270
Rafe, no. No, okay? You can't think that.

49:41.353 --> 49:42.563
It was punishment.

49:42.646 --> 49:43.898
It was God.

49:45.399 --> 49:47.985
He's... he's...

49:48.861 --> 49:52.406
he's paying me back
for all the things that I've done.

49:52.489 --> 49:55.034
That's why I left the gun unlocked.

49:57.077 --> 49:58.704
That's why Earl found it.

49:58.787 --> 49:59.788
No.

50:01.248 --> 50:02.249
Listen to me.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.919
God wouldn't do that.

50:05.002 --> 50:09.423
He knows that you are a good cop.

50:10.799 --> 50:15.471
And an even better man.
Hey, and I'm here for you.

51:14.697 --> 51:17.491
Okay, okay. Thank you. Thank you.

51:17.574 --> 51:20.452
This complex is a new beginning.

51:21.120 --> 51:26.542
And we all know how hard it can be
sometimes starting over.

51:27.543 --> 51:28.544
But...

51:31.964 --> 51:34.633
we will do it together.

51:34.717 --> 51:39.263
Together, Harlem rises.

51:39.346 --> 51:41.015
She always does.

51:43.600 --> 51:45.728
That's all she knows how to do.

51:46.854 --> 51:48.397
Family first!

51:48.939 --> 51:49.857
Always!

51:50.858 --> 51:53.610
Come on. Welcome home, Harlem! Come on in!

51:54.653 --> 51:58.198
Come on in! Come on in! Come home, Harlem!

52:08.625 --> 52:12.087
Please! Please, everyone, calm down.
Everyone, calm down.

52:37.905 --> 52:39.239
You do parties now?

52:40.366 --> 52:43.077
'Cause my cousin's <i>quinceaÃ±era</i>
is next week.

52:43.160 --> 52:45.954
Cut the shit. Are you with the Jamaicans?

52:46.038 --> 52:47.206
Where's Bushmaster?

52:47.289 --> 52:49.166
Bushmaster? Where?

52:49.875 --> 52:51.585
Everybody having a good time?

52:53.921 --> 52:54.880
You better be,

52:54.963 --> 52:58.550
because if you're workin' for me,
you just made a whole lot of money.

53:03.055 --> 53:06.141
I'm like, "What up?"
Where Luke Cage? Where he at? Luke...

53:06.225 --> 53:10.270
There he is! Luke, come on up here, man.
Come on. Come on, Luke. Come on.

53:14.358 --> 53:17.528
Don't you just love him,
with his superhero ass?

53:17.611 --> 53:19.988
I got another treat for you.

53:20.072 --> 53:21.657
I got another treat!

53:22.241 --> 53:25.160
Who wants to shoot a bulletproof man?

53:26.120 --> 53:27.830
Oh, shit.

53:31.291 --> 53:32.793
Who will do it?

53:32.876 --> 53:35.963
- Put it down.
- Oh, come on, Luke, have a little fun.

53:36.046 --> 53:38.298
If you shoot and it ricochets,
it could kill somebody.

53:38.382 --> 53:39.633
Now put it down!

53:39.716 --> 53:42.719
You're making me look bad, Luke.
Don't do that, huh?

53:43.387 --> 53:44.680
You want that 150, don't you?

53:46.265 --> 53:48.183
Then hop to it, pet bitch.

53:49.017 --> 53:50.727
I hired you to do a job.

53:50.811 --> 53:51.895
Now do it.

54:14.126 --> 54:18.380
Hey, don't touch me!
I'm Piranha, bitch. Don't touch me.

54:18.464 --> 54:20.549
Luke! Luke!

54:20.632 --> 54:21.675
What y'all doing?

54:23.844 --> 54:26.305
Hey, please! Luke! You got the wrong guy!

54:26.388 --> 54:28.974
Wait! Wait! No! I'm not... It's not me!

54:29.057 --> 54:31.101
Oh, shit! Wait! Look, look...

54:32.186 --> 54:33.687
Look, I...

54:39.193 --> 54:40.444
Help!

54:40.527 --> 54:42.529
God!
Look, I don't know who you think...

54:42.613 --> 54:44.865
Shut up, man.

54:57.711 --> 55:00.506
- Why does Bushmaster want you?
- I don't know. I don't even know the guy!

55:00.589 --> 55:02.716
- He knows you.
- Luke! Luke, listen. Please.

55:02.799 --> 55:04.635
You gotta help me.
You gotta protect me, man.

55:04.718 --> 55:06.929
Please. Brother.

55:15.312 --> 55:16.897
You wanna hire this hero?

55:18.857 --> 55:20.526
The price just doubled.
