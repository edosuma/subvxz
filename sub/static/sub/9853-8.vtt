00:00.421 --> 00:02.833
♪♪

00:04.505 --> 00:08.089
Lewie, Beast and Daphne
are away for the weekend,

00:08.089 --> 00:09.720
which means I get to
do something

00:09.720 --> 00:11.552
I've never done before.

00:13.804 --> 00:15.766
The backwards couch flop.

00:15.766 --> 00:18.099
Normally, if I did this,

00:18.099 --> 00:19.940
I would land on
at least four other people,

00:19.940 --> 00:21.482
and half a pizza.

00:22.903 --> 00:25.066
This is what it's like
 not sharing a bathroom.

00:25.066 --> 00:26.907
I actually have time
 to brush all my teeth,

00:26.907 --> 00:28.949
not just the ones
 that show.

00:28.949 --> 00:31.112
And this, my friends,
 is what it's like

00:31.112 --> 00:32.743
to not have to
 kidney punch people

00:32.743 --> 00:35.116
to get to the milk.

00:35.116 --> 00:37.748
Even if it smells like cheese
that's been left in a gym bag.

00:40.791 --> 00:42.423
Listen up.

00:42.423 --> 00:46.217
With your mom and the tornado
trio at Grandma's

00:46.217 --> 00:48.259
tonight may be the first time
in 16 years

00:48.259 --> 00:50.971
that I've been able to watch
an entire ball game.

00:50.971 --> 00:53.474
So unless there's a fire,
a felony or a fracture,

00:53.474 --> 00:54.885
forget I'm your father.

00:54.885 --> 00:56.677
Already forgotten.
Got plans.

00:56.677 --> 00:58.099
- Me, too.
- Me, too too.

00:58.099 --> 00:59.850
Wait.

00:59.850 --> 01:02.443
Does that mean I'll be the only
kid in the house tonight?

01:02.443 --> 01:04.144
That's like Halley's Comet.

01:04.144 --> 01:07.027
It only happens
every 75 years.

01:07.027 --> 01:08.949
Like Beast putting
the toilet seat up.

01:08.949 --> 01:11.612
Or down.
Or even hitting the toilet.

01:11.612 --> 01:15.286
Look, I love
my brothers and sisters,

01:15.286 --> 01:16.827
but because of them,

01:16.827 --> 01:19.870
I've never had
a successful slumber party.

01:19.870 --> 01:23.334
My friends either get driven
away by the younger kids...

01:23.334 --> 01:26.167
HARLEY: Beast, Lewie, no!

01:27.208 --> 01:30.010
Or sucked in
by the older ones.

01:30.010 --> 01:32.633
Changing your part
adds instant bounce.

01:32.633 --> 01:36.307
Body, blah.

01:36.307 --> 01:39.640
Body, blah.

01:39.640 --> 01:41.272
GIRLS: Oh!

01:41.272 --> 01:45.025
But tonight, all that's
going to change.

01:45.025 --> 01:48.189
Dad, can I have
a slumber party?

01:48.189 --> 01:50.281
That sounds like a question
for your father.

01:50.281 --> 01:51.652
I'm just some guy
watching the game.

01:51.652 --> 01:53.944
Well, if you see my dad,

01:53.944 --> 01:55.156
tell him thanks.

02:01.452 --> 02:04.505
What's this?
Flavored creamer?

02:06.917 --> 02:09.008
Nice. Cheesecake.

02:10.920 --> 02:13.254
Nothing but the best

have aligned for

Harley's Comet Sleepover,

03:10.731 --> 03:13.574
which includes an actual comet
we're gonna watch from the roof.

03:13.574 --> 03:15.576
Sure, the roof's off limits,

03:15.576 --> 03:18.118
but the tattletales
have left the building.

03:18.118 --> 03:19.450
Think fast!

03:22.243 --> 03:23.664
Was that a pass to me?

03:23.664 --> 03:25.246
Not important.

03:25.246 --> 03:26.827
What is important is tonight,

03:26.827 --> 03:28.919
league MVP
and my personal hero

03:28.919 --> 03:30.921
Mikaela Mendoza
drops her new,

03:30.921 --> 03:32.423
limited edition
basketball shoe.

03:32.423 --> 03:33.924
I wrote all about it
on my blog.

03:33.924 --> 03:36.757
- "I'm a basket case."
- You nailed the title.

03:36.757 --> 03:38.839
Come on. We gotta go now
to get a good place in line.

03:38.839 --> 03:40.801
Georgie, I can't.

03:40.801 --> 03:42.763
I have plans,
once-in-a-lifetime plans.

03:42.763 --> 03:44.605
But you promised
you'd go with me.

03:44.605 --> 03:46.267
I did? When?

03:47.938 --> 03:49.900
Since I'm helping you test
your new spray tanning helmet,

03:49.900 --> 03:51.402
will you come with me

03:51.402 --> 03:52.983
to get new basketball shoes
next weekend?

03:52.983 --> 03:55.486
Sorry, Georgie.
I'm pretty busy.

03:57.908 --> 03:59.280
How's my tan?

03:59.280 --> 04:00.571
Amazing, right?

04:00.571 --> 04:01.782
Grab me a mirror.

04:01.782 --> 04:03.784
Forget the mirror.

04:03.784 --> 04:05.576
Tell me all about
these super cool

04:05.576 --> 04:07.918
- basketball shoes
we're getting.
- Okay.

04:07.918 --> 04:10.331
Right.
The Oompa Loompa incident.

04:10.331 --> 04:12.212
Just because
I love basketball

04:12.212 --> 04:13.714
doesn't mean
I wanna look like one.

04:13.714 --> 04:15.586
Can't you just go alone?

04:15.586 --> 04:18.969
No. They only give out
one pair per person,
and I need two--

04:18.969 --> 04:21.512
one to play in
and one to look perfect
when I walk down the aisle.

04:21.512 --> 04:23.804
I'm sure I'll read
all about it on your blog.

04:23.804 --> 04:25.386
We're jetting in 20.

04:25.386 --> 04:27.808
We'll be in line all night,
so don't wear tight shoes.

04:27.808 --> 04:31.231
You don't wanna end up
with feet like basketball
legend Andrea Ahlgreen.

04:31.231 --> 04:32.813
Hammer toes.

04:39.490 --> 04:41.742
Later.

04:41.742 --> 04:43.994
Yeah, okay.

04:43.994 --> 04:46.407
Whoa!
Where do you think
you're going?

04:46.407 --> 04:49.580
Library. Hannah's picking
me up to do homework.

04:49.580 --> 04:51.792
- ( motorcycle revs )
- Bye.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.505
I know that sound.
That's the sound of you
dropping out of school.

04:54.505 --> 04:56.877
- No, it's Cuff.
- One leads to the other.

04:56.877 --> 04:59.009
I don't know
what bothers me more,

04:59.009 --> 05:00.881
that you lied to me,
or you put so little
effort into it.

05:00.881 --> 05:03.344
Really? I put so little
effort into everything,

05:03.344 --> 05:04.975
except this.

05:04.975 --> 05:07.478
I didn't think
you'd care that much.
You're not Mom.

05:07.478 --> 05:09.640
Sure, you get
mad and stuff,

05:09.640 --> 05:11.982
but Mom's the one
that brings the punishment.

05:11.982 --> 05:13.894
It works for you guys.
Why mess with it?

05:16.697 --> 05:18.399
Come on, Ethan.

05:18.399 --> 05:20.441
You gotta go with
Georgie for me.

05:20.441 --> 05:23.073
I've got one night to go
through Beast and Lewie's stuff

05:23.073 --> 05:25.536
and get my stuff back.
No dice.

05:25.536 --> 05:28.619
Actually, dice.

05:28.619 --> 05:30.541
What's more important,

05:30.541 --> 05:33.714
your stuff
or your favorite sister?

05:33.714 --> 05:35.045
My favorite video game,

05:35.045 --> 05:36.717
my favorite comic book,

05:36.717 --> 05:39.800
algebra book.
This can stay lost.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.632
I wonder if those
little looters

05:41.632 --> 05:43.464
have my snow jacket.

05:43.464 --> 05:44.885
I'm going back in.

05:44.885 --> 05:46.557
Raiders of the Lost Parka.

05:49.730 --> 05:52.893
I'm trying to do you
a solid here, bro.

05:52.893 --> 05:56.437
All my girls are coming
over for a sleepover tonight,

05:56.437 --> 05:58.479
and I know how much
you enjoy that.

06:00.000 --> 06:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:14.455 --> 06:17.087
( camera shutters clicking )

06:17.087 --> 06:19.049
( shrieking )

06:19.049 --> 06:23.173
Okay, okay.
I'll go.

06:23.173 --> 06:25.636
At least I can read this
when I'm in line.

06:26.717 --> 06:30.060
Well, I found the boys'
gum collection.

06:33.604 --> 06:34.645
Ellie.

06:34.645 --> 06:37.107
You're two hours early.

06:37.107 --> 06:39.610
I'm so excited,
I came for the pre-party.

06:39.610 --> 06:41.782
There is no pre-party.

06:41.782 --> 06:44.655
I should've guessed from
the lack of paparazzi out front.

06:44.655 --> 06:47.157
Never mind.
I'm just glad you're here.

06:47.157 --> 06:49.870
I wasn't sure
you were coming.

06:49.870 --> 06:51.622
You said your mom
doesn't like slumber parties,

06:51.622 --> 06:53.874
- or our family.
- She doesn't.

06:53.874 --> 06:56.166
she calls them the first step
on the slippery slope

06:56.166 --> 06:58.499
to living
an alternative lifestyle.

06:58.499 --> 07:00.380
It's only a sleepover.

07:00.380 --> 07:02.843
No. That's what she
calls your family.

07:02.843 --> 07:06.216
But she said I could go
as long as I snooped in
your medicine cabinet.

07:06.216 --> 07:08.098
Snoop away.

07:08.098 --> 07:10.180
There's nothing in there
but a broken thermometer

07:10.180 --> 07:12.262
and a box of peanut brittle
Mom thinks she's hiding from us.

07:12.262 --> 07:15.556
Oh. So, hit me
with the party deets.

07:15.556 --> 07:17.187
I just read that
in a magazine.

07:17.187 --> 07:18.899
Get ready.

07:18.899 --> 07:21.061
I've been planning
this night for ten years.

07:21.061 --> 07:23.023
I supersized some speakers

07:23.023 --> 07:25.656
so we can pump-kin up
the bass.

07:25.656 --> 07:27.828
Thanks to a little
food chemistry,

07:27.828 --> 07:30.240
I've prepared a 20-flavor
potato chip bar.

07:30.240 --> 07:32.953
And the best part is,
everybody's gone,

07:32.953 --> 07:34.665
so we have the room
to ourselves,

07:34.665 --> 07:37.498
and your exclusive membership
as my best friend

07:37.498 --> 07:40.340
allows you into
our VIP lounge.

07:42.082 --> 07:43.714
What are you doing here?

07:43.714 --> 07:45.255
Dad grounded me.

07:45.255 --> 07:46.887
Is she on the list?

07:46.887 --> 07:49.009
Out!

07:49.009 --> 07:51.011
Let me talk with her.

07:51.011 --> 07:53.183
I can usually
reason with her.

07:55.225 --> 07:57.518
Rachel.

07:57.518 --> 07:59.189
And stay out!

08:03.063 --> 08:05.866
I don't think
this is one of those times.

08:10.611 --> 08:12.663
No, no, down, down!
Aahhh!

08:12.663 --> 08:14.535
Hey, Dad.

08:14.535 --> 08:17.167
Not seeing blood
or smelling fire.
Go away.

08:17.167 --> 08:20.581
I would, but I'm trying
to get ready for my sleepover,

08:20.581 --> 08:22.793
and Rachel's
hogging up the room.

08:22.793 --> 08:25.085
She said you grounded her.

08:25.085 --> 08:27.548
Yep. Mom's not the only
one dropping the hammer
round here.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.129
You can call me Thor.

08:29.129 --> 08:30.631
No, wait, call me
God of Thunder.

08:30.631 --> 08:32.592
Ooh, commercial's over.
Call me later.

08:32.592 --> 08:34.595
If you think Thor
would ground his daughter

08:34.595 --> 08:37.437
by letting her watch
 Dance Dads on her laptop

08:37.437 --> 08:40.230
while live blogging
about it, then go ahead.

08:40.230 --> 08:43.563
Wait. Rachel's live blogging
 Dance Dads right now?

08:43.563 --> 08:46.907
And she's also
texting her friends,

08:46.907 --> 08:49.279
saying how harsh
your punishment was.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.951
Winky face, winky face.

08:50.951 --> 08:52.743
Really? Well, I'm gonna take
away her electronics,

08:52.743 --> 08:54.575
and make her study
in her room all night.

08:54.575 --> 08:56.917
- Sad face, sad face.
- What?

08:56.917 --> 08:58.288
What? Sad face
not a thing?

08:59.790 --> 09:02.002
Rachel in my room?

09:02.002 --> 09:04.004
All night?

09:04.004 --> 09:06.506
How am I supposed
to have my party?

09:06.506 --> 09:09.590
Panic face, panic face.

09:09.590 --> 09:12.382
Oh, idea face.

09:12.382 --> 09:15.135
If you want Rachel
to do her homework,

09:15.135 --> 09:17.477
she needs to be
down here with you.

09:17.477 --> 09:20.060
Sitting in the same room
as a caring parent.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.852
That's what she calls
punishment.

09:21.852 --> 09:23.523
You're right.

09:23.523 --> 09:26.486
- Rachel, get down here.
- Better to text.

09:27.527 --> 09:31.071
RACHEL: Downstairs?
Seriously?

09:31.071 --> 09:34.324
Look how close we are
to the front of the line.

09:34.324 --> 09:36.366
Oh, it's awesome.

09:36.366 --> 09:38.078
It's even more awesome
how far away from

09:38.078 --> 09:39.790
Harley's girlfriends
we are.

09:39.790 --> 09:41.371
At least I hope we are.

09:41.371 --> 09:43.794
They can't drive
yet, can they?

09:43.794 --> 09:47.547
Look. We're even ahead
of Molly Hooper.
What a ball hog.

09:47.547 --> 09:50.921
Ball hog? She rides the bench
almost as much as you do.

09:50.921 --> 09:54.134
Exactly. She hogs the part
of the bench right by
the ball rack.

09:54.134 --> 09:55.305
Prime real estate.

09:55.305 --> 09:57.017
Why is she even here?

09:57.017 --> 09:59.139
Her feet aren't anything
like Mikaela Mendoza's.

09:59.139 --> 10:01.812
Big-time toe fungus.

10:01.812 --> 10:03.563
Maybe later.

10:04.815 --> 10:07.027
Hey, look at that.

10:07.027 --> 10:08.568
People are selling
their place in line.

10:08.568 --> 10:10.190
Losers.

10:10.190 --> 10:12.823
I wouldn't give away
this spot for a million dollars.

10:12.823 --> 10:15.155
Hey, let's see if we can
get a wave going.

10:15.155 --> 10:17.577
You've got seven more hours
in line.

10:17.577 --> 10:18.829
Why not?

10:22.082 --> 10:25.005
Anybody willing
to give up their spot?

10:25.005 --> 10:27.337
Oh, thank you so much
for giving me your spot.

10:27.337 --> 10:29.509
No, we were just
doing the wave.

10:29.509 --> 10:32.963
Can I offer you
a high-protein snack?

10:32.963 --> 10:34.805
Some jerky
or Greek yogurt?

10:34.805 --> 10:37.307
I really need these shoes.

10:37.307 --> 10:40.681
You see, my father volunteered
to spend a year in space,

10:40.681 --> 10:43.523
but before he goes,
he's doing this contest with me

10:43.523 --> 10:46.026
so we can win some money
to replace our house

10:46.026 --> 10:48.148
that burned down.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.900
And I think it would
really help us win

10:49.900 --> 10:51.571
if he was wearing
a pair of Mendozas.

11:02.542 --> 11:04.584
Oh, I forgot.

11:04.584 --> 11:06.747
Look at what
I got for us.

11:06.747 --> 11:07.788
Laser pointers.

11:07.788 --> 11:09.589
There's a PowerPoint later.

11:09.589 --> 11:11.461
Mom made a great one
for my sixth birthday.

11:11.461 --> 11:15.055
Twenty reasons orange slices
are better than birthday cake.

11:15.055 --> 11:16.927
Reason number one:
you can't peel a cake.

11:16.927 --> 11:20.060
No. These are to drive
the neighbors' dogs crazy.

11:20.060 --> 11:22.562
Slumber parties are
all about crazy hijinks.

11:22.562 --> 11:24.975
And tonight will be
the hijinks-iest.

11:24.975 --> 11:25.976
Do we get to play Truth?

11:25.976 --> 11:27.067
You mean Truth Or Dare?

11:27.067 --> 11:28.899
Mom and I
only play Truth.

11:28.899 --> 11:30.901
You mean there's
another part?

11:30.901 --> 11:33.573
I'm starting to think
my parties were a bust.

11:33.573 --> 11:36.737
Well, our bad parties
are a thing of the past.

11:36.737 --> 11:40.580
Tonight, we're turning it
all around.

11:40.580 --> 11:42.082
( glass smashing )

11:46.416 --> 11:48.128
Thirteen broken mirrors?

11:48.128 --> 11:49.920
No bad luck there.

11:49.920 --> 11:52.422
I'll go grab a broom.

11:54.294 --> 11:56.596
Bad luck's
starting already.

11:56.596 --> 11:59.299
How are you back so soon?

11:59.299 --> 12:01.301
We gave up our
place in line

12:01.301 --> 12:03.723
to a girl who needed
the shoes more than I did.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.306
Yeah, her father's gonna
spend a year on a space station.

12:06.306 --> 12:09.269
There are many requirements
for being an astronaut.

12:09.269 --> 12:10.941
Cool sneakers,
not one of them.

12:10.941 --> 12:13.353
You guys got duped
by a sob story.

12:13.353 --> 12:15.445
It wasn't a sob story.

12:15.445 --> 12:17.277
They were trying
to enter a contest.

12:17.277 --> 12:19.119
And there wasn't
any time to ask questions.

12:19.119 --> 12:20.991
Their house just
burned down.

12:20.991 --> 12:22.993
I think we got duped
by a sob story.

12:22.993 --> 12:24.955
How did we not see that?

12:24.955 --> 12:26.286
It's so obvious
in the replay.

12:26.286 --> 12:28.328
Because you guys
are too honest.

12:28.328 --> 12:30.500
I am not.
Okay, that's a lie.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.133
Face it,
you're the Diaz softies.

12:34.464 --> 12:36.336
Before you say anything,

12:36.336 --> 12:38.508
we know it was
a lot to spend
for a giant teddy bear,

12:38.508 --> 12:40.300
but it was for
a good cause.

12:40.300 --> 12:42.182
Habitat for Jerry's
Spring Break.

12:42.182 --> 12:43.974
And it was the only
giant teddy bear

12:43.974 --> 12:46.186
salvaged from
the Titanic.

12:47.597 --> 12:49.689
I feel so violated.

12:49.689 --> 12:52.522
Even more than when
your friends wait for me
outside the bathroom.

12:52.522 --> 12:55.025
There is only one way
you're going to feel better.

12:55.025 --> 12:57.157
You need to march
right back to that store

12:57.157 --> 12:59.029
and take your place
in line back.

12:59.029 --> 13:00.821
How?

13:00.821 --> 13:03.403
What would bad girl point guard
Mikaela Mendoza tell you?

13:03.403 --> 13:05.826
She'd say, "Georgie,
get back in the game,

13:05.826 --> 13:07.868
and if someone
plays dirty, play dirty back.

13:07.868 --> 13:10.540
Also, eat Sporty-O's,
the slam dunk of cereals."

13:10.540 --> 13:12.372
Godspeed, softies.

13:13.673 --> 13:16.967
Why is the guy with
the red hair on the red team?

13:16.967 --> 13:19.679
The teal team is way
more his palette.

13:19.679 --> 13:22.512
( scoffs )
They don't dress
according to palette.

13:22.512 --> 13:24.054
It's more about
skill set.

13:24.054 --> 13:27.687
And now I missed
the rare triple play.

13:27.687 --> 13:30.190
- ( turns channel,
lively music plays )
- Stop, stop, stop!

13:30.190 --> 13:32.022
That's Dancing With
 My Dad.

13:32.022 --> 13:33.934
It's a two-hour
season finale.

13:33.934 --> 13:37.357
Please.
Just during
the commercial?

13:37.357 --> 13:40.570
What's the difference
between Dance Dads
 and Dancing With My Dad?

13:40.570 --> 13:43.073
DD is about dads
whose daughters dance.

13:43.073 --> 13:46.036
DWMD is about dads
dancing with
their daughters.

13:46.036 --> 13:48.538
You know what?
TMI.

13:48.538 --> 13:51.661
Come on.
It's a good show.

13:51.661 --> 13:54.875
The families always have
some major tragic thing
that happened,

13:54.875 --> 13:57.217
and everybody
at the end cries.

13:57.217 --> 13:58.338
It's really fun.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.880
I get that.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.382
I almost cried when
I missed that rare
triple play.

14:08.598 --> 14:11.731
Welcome to Star Club 360.

14:11.731 --> 14:13.894
Everything
a young astronomer needs.

14:13.894 --> 14:15.896
And sparkling cider.

14:17.147 --> 14:19.569
It's T-minus 30 minutes
till the crew arrives.

14:19.569 --> 14:22.742
Uh, I guess this is
a bad time to tell you

14:22.742 --> 14:25.485
that I'm afraid
of heights.

14:25.485 --> 14:28.248
Then it's definitely
a bad time to tell you

14:28.248 --> 14:30.410
you just locked us out.

14:36.666 --> 14:38.458
How did you
lock us out?

14:38.458 --> 14:41.171
The girls are gonna
be here any minute.

14:42.802 --> 14:46.176
I can't talk.
Panicking.

14:46.176 --> 14:49.930
Why didn't you tell me you were
afraid of heights before?

14:49.930 --> 14:51.811
I didn't know.

14:51.811 --> 14:54.314
Mom won't let me on
anything higher than
a step stool

14:54.314 --> 14:57.777
without a three-point
safety harness.
Anybody!

14:57.777 --> 15:02.732
Quiet. If my dad hears,
we're in trouble big time.

15:02.732 --> 15:04.945
There's gotta be
something up here

15:04.945 --> 15:06.576
to get us down.

15:06.576 --> 15:09.029
In this family, if you
want something to disappear,

15:09.029 --> 15:10.580
you know where to throw it.

15:10.580 --> 15:12.792
Wow, Mom, you brought
prune loaf again.

15:12.792 --> 15:15.295
I cannot wait
to dig in.

15:18.498 --> 15:19.879
( glass shatters )

15:24.304 --> 15:26.096
Please tell me
your amazing brain

15:26.096 --> 15:27.927
has come up with something
to get us down.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.679
Not yet.
But on a creepy note,

15:29.679 --> 15:32.472
now we know where
Daphne sends her naughty dolls.

15:32.472 --> 15:34.514
Can you figure out
something fast,

15:34.514 --> 15:36.016
because I just remembered,

15:36.016 --> 15:37.317
I'm also afraid of the dark.

15:37.317 --> 15:38.979
( wings flapping )

15:38.979 --> 15:41.151
And birds.

15:41.151 --> 15:43.823
Okay, I don't know
who invited Crazy Rooftop Ellie,

15:43.823 --> 15:46.156
- but she needs to chill.
- I'm trying.

15:50.490 --> 15:52.742
Okay, that bird fear,
not so crazy.

15:55.205 --> 15:56.997
Oh! This guy is so good.

15:56.997 --> 15:58.999
How can the judge say
he has two left feet?

15:58.999 --> 16:01.211
Because he does
have two left feet.

16:01.211 --> 16:02.502
Literally.

16:03.793 --> 16:07.257
He makes it look
so easy. Huh?

16:07.257 --> 16:09.589
Huh?

16:09.589 --> 16:11.391
What do you think?

16:11.391 --> 16:15.055
I think those chips
deserve a better salsa.

16:16.146 --> 16:18.398
Okay, that girl
played us.

16:18.398 --> 16:20.810
Now we gotta find
someone to play.

16:20.810 --> 16:22.772
Totally done being
the pushovers of the family.

16:22.772 --> 16:24.604
Okay.

16:26.566 --> 16:28.488
Too mean.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.990
Too nice.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.913
Too much like Mom.

16:33.913 --> 16:36.746
Aw, she's got a dog.

16:36.746 --> 16:38.618
This is too hard.

16:38.618 --> 16:40.710
I'm out.

16:40.710 --> 16:42.252
( sighs )
I can do this.

16:42.252 --> 16:44.084
I must do this.

16:44.084 --> 16:46.886
If not for me,
for Mikaela Mendoza.

16:49.889 --> 16:53.433
Excuse me, I was
wondering if you'd
give me your place in line.

16:53.433 --> 16:55.725
My father is
an astronaut,

16:55.725 --> 16:58.558
and we're raising money
to buy him shoes

16:58.558 --> 17:00.400
to get away from
the fire,

17:00.400 --> 17:02.562
because his space station
burned down,

17:02.562 --> 17:03.983
and... ( sighs )

17:03.983 --> 17:05.734
Here's a dollar
for your time,

17:05.734 --> 17:07.567
and another one for
pain and suffering.

17:07.567 --> 17:09.409
Bye.

17:11.111 --> 17:14.614
You're not on a roof,
Ellie, you're on
a tropical beach.

17:14.614 --> 17:16.656
Smell the surf.

17:16.656 --> 17:19.749
Feel the sun
on your shoulders.

17:19.749 --> 17:22.582
Great. Now I'm
getting sunburned.

17:22.582 --> 17:25.335
No. You put on
pretend sunscreen.

17:25.335 --> 17:27.547
- Right.
- ( wings flapping )

17:27.547 --> 17:29.169
Incoming!

17:30.470 --> 17:32.051
( whispering )
He's after us.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.344
Okay, let me think.

17:34.344 --> 17:36.556
The girls will
be here soon,

17:36.556 --> 17:37.847
and when Dad
comes looking for me...

17:37.847 --> 17:40.350
it'll be
bye-bye, sleepover,

17:40.350 --> 17:42.982
hello, Thor's
mighty hammer of discipline.

17:42.982 --> 17:45.145
Why do my parents
ever listen to me?

17:45.145 --> 17:46.146
Harley, look.

17:48.278 --> 17:51.191
We have to raise their attention
without raising any attention.

17:53.153 --> 17:54.784
It's official, Ethan.

17:54.784 --> 17:57.287
We are the softies
of the family.

17:57.287 --> 17:58.498
The champs of chump.

17:58.498 --> 18:00.620
Prince and princess
of patsies.

18:00.620 --> 18:03.042
The Diaz doormats.

18:03.042 --> 18:05.165
Maybe we're just
nice people.

18:05.165 --> 18:07.297
Oh, sure,
rub it in.

18:07.297 --> 18:09.259
Shoes.

18:09.259 --> 18:11.551
One, two,
cha-cha-cha.

18:11.551 --> 18:13.973
Three, four,
cha-cha-cha.

18:13.973 --> 18:16.095
Legs together.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.218
Legs together!

18:23.062 --> 18:24.484
Just my luck.

18:24.484 --> 18:26.146
I can't get
the shoes I want,

18:26.146 --> 18:28.488
and now random ones
are raining from the sky.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.492
Great.

18:32.492 --> 18:35.405
We're cold, hungry,
and now shoeless.

18:35.405 --> 18:37.497
All I wanted was
one successful sleepover

18:37.497 --> 18:39.499
before I'm too old.

18:39.499 --> 18:42.001
I'd get up
and give you a hug,

18:42.001 --> 18:45.335
but my nails are dug
pretty deep into
these shingles.

18:45.335 --> 18:47.507
( wings flapping )

18:48.668 --> 18:50.670
If that bird's
not careful,

18:50.670 --> 18:55.014
it is going to get
a beak full of prune loaf.

18:55.014 --> 18:57.016
Man, this thing's
like a brick.

18:58.678 --> 19:01.851
Maybe I can use this
to get us down.

19:05.185 --> 19:07.857
I'll wedge it
into this pipe,

19:07.857 --> 19:10.190
shove the hockey stick
in it,

19:10.190 --> 19:11.901
and use it to catapult me

19:11.901 --> 19:13.943
safely onto
the Goldsmiths' awning.

19:16.946 --> 19:18.698
DOLL: Mama.

19:18.698 --> 19:20.370
HARLEY: Test run,
epic fail.

19:20.370 --> 19:25.044
Okay, the trajectory's
a little off.

19:25.044 --> 19:27.957
But if I stopped up
the rain gutter with
the prune loaf--

19:27.957 --> 19:29.999
The prune loaf isn't
gonna stop up anything.

19:29.999 --> 19:32.252
Trust me, that prune loaf
stops up the whole family.

19:32.252 --> 19:33.423
( wings flapping )

19:33.423 --> 19:35.215
Just do it, do it!

19:35.215 --> 19:37.257
Wow.

19:37.257 --> 19:39.389
The pillow really does
help keep the legs together.

19:39.389 --> 19:41.561
You have to admit,
it feels pretty silly.

19:41.561 --> 19:44.264
No sillier than Dominguez
not running out
that ground ball.

19:44.264 --> 19:45.565
Oh, you were listening.

19:47.517 --> 19:50.149
- This is super weird.
- I know.

19:50.149 --> 19:52.151
Usually, Dad only
does the Robot.

19:52.151 --> 19:54.694
He doesn't know
how over that is.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.696
( gasps )
Ooh, Dad, it's
final elimination.

19:57.817 --> 20:00.820
Zip it and sit
or we'll miss the crying.

20:04.083 --> 20:06.246
Okay, we are about
to find out

20:06.246 --> 20:08.918
if Lamar's sloppy footwork
in the pasa doble
will send him home.

20:08.918 --> 20:11.291
ANNOUNCER: And according to
 your votes, America,

20:11.291 --> 20:13.593
the first
 father-daughter team

20:13.593 --> 20:14.964
leaving us tonight is...

20:17.136 --> 20:19.178
( static )

20:19.178 --> 20:21.100
This cannot
be happening.

20:21.100 --> 20:22.802
Oh, that stupid
satellite dish.

20:22.802 --> 20:26.806
If my dad finds me
splattered all over the cement,

20:26.806 --> 20:28.938
remember, I was never
up here.

20:30.610 --> 20:34.314
Harley! What are you
doing up here?

20:34.314 --> 20:36.446
Quite possibly riding
a prune loaf to my death.

20:36.446 --> 20:38.117
Get in here.

20:42.282 --> 20:44.994
You know you're not
supposed to be on the roof.

20:44.994 --> 20:48.288
I wanted to watch a comet
for my sleepover,
and we got locked out.

20:48.288 --> 20:50.790
- Well, you're grounded.
- Grounded?

20:50.790 --> 20:53.673
I grounded two kids tonight;
Mom's gonna be pretty impressed.

20:53.673 --> 20:55.254
Thor is bringing the thunder.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.467
My sleepover may look
more lifeless

20:57.467 --> 21:00.590
than that dead doll
on the Goldsmiths' driveway,

21:00.590 --> 21:03.142
but I am not giving up.

21:03.142 --> 21:06.225
Gotta say, I'm just
glad you found us.

21:06.225 --> 21:08.478
We were out there
for almost an hour

21:08.478 --> 21:11.311
until you noticed
we were gone.

21:11.311 --> 21:14.394
But you were probably
doing something pretty
important, right?

21:14.394 --> 21:17.196
Yeah, I was watching TV
and learning to cha-cha.

21:17.196 --> 21:19.198
At least you got Rachel
to finish her homework.

21:21.240 --> 21:25.074
Mom doesn't need to know
everything that happens here,

21:25.074 --> 21:26.666
as long as you
don't do this again.

21:26.666 --> 21:30.410
- Trust me, I won't.
- Good. Come on.

21:33.212 --> 21:35.254
Guys.

21:35.254 --> 21:37.507
Guys!

21:39.339 --> 21:41.010
You were out here, too?

21:41.010 --> 21:43.222
Ellie, you know
it's not safe.

21:44.474 --> 21:46.806
Look! The comet!

21:48.227 --> 21:50.390
It's beautiful.

21:50.390 --> 21:52.522
( wings flapping )

21:52.522 --> 21:55.895
I guess he enjoyed it, too.

21:59.198 --> 22:02.031
HARLEY: Okay, maybe it's not
 the super sweet slumber party

22:02.031 --> 22:04.073
I had planned.

22:04.073 --> 22:05.825
Look. It's her.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.827
The girl we gave
our place in line to.

22:07.827 --> 22:10.079
My dad may be
 going into space,

22:10.079 --> 22:14.123
but today, I met
 two angels from heaven.

22:14.123 --> 22:15.415
Those are my shoes.

22:15.415 --> 22:17.717
We're not suckers
after all!

22:17.717 --> 22:20.760
At a moment like this,

22:20.760 --> 22:23.262
all of us bonding
 on the couch,

22:23.262 --> 22:27.727
maybe it's better than
 a slumber party on the roof.

22:27.727 --> 22:30.059
I know it's rarer.

22:31.305 --> 22:37.588
