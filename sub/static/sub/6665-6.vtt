00:00.499 --> 00:02.498
<i>- My name is Nathan Fielder,</i>

00:02.499 --> 00:04.499
<i>and I graduated from one of</i>
<i>Canada's top business schools</i>

00:04.700 --> 00:07.498
<i>with really good grades.</i>

00:07.499 --> 00:08.498
<i>Now I'm using my knowledge</i>

00:08.499 --> 00:11.498
<i>to help struggling</i>
<i>small business owners make it</i>

00:11.499 --> 00:14.498
<i>in this competitive world.</i>

00:14.499 --> 00:17.499
This is "Nathan for You."

00:18.499 --> 00:19.498
<i>If you're</i>
<i>a traveling businessman</i>

00:19.499 --> 00:21.498
<i>visiting Pomona, California,</i>

00:21.499 --> 00:25.498
<i>chances are you'll stay</i>
<i>at the iconic Hilltop Hotel.</i>

00:25.499 --> 00:27.498
<i>But recently,</i>
<i>hotel manager Kenny Pang</i>

00:27.499 --> 00:30.498
<i>has been eager to attract</i>
<i>a new type of clientele:</i>

00:30.499 --> 00:31.499
<i>families on vacation.</i>

00:32.499 --> 00:33.499
- The hotel would like to,
you know,

00:34.499 --> 00:36.498
get more families to come in
because when they--

00:36.499 --> 00:37.499
when they come in,

00:38.499 --> 00:41.498
they will stay a lot longer
than the other guests.

00:41.499 --> 00:42.499
<i>- But as far as I'm concerned,</i>

00:43.499 --> 00:44.498
<i>if you want to attract</i>
<i>families,</i>

00:44.499 --> 00:47.060
<i>you have to cater to the needs</i>
<i>of the parents.</i>

00:47.499 --> 00:49.498
<i>So I paid Kenny a visit</i>
<i>with a way to help.</i>

00:49.499 --> 00:51.498
When couples stay alone
in a hotel,

00:51.499 --> 00:53.498
if their relationship's
going well,

00:53.499 --> 00:55.498
they'll usually have sex,
right?

00:55.499 --> 00:57.498
- [laughs]

00:57.499 --> 00:59.498
That's common sense.

00:59.499 --> 01:02.498
- Yeah. But when families
travel together,

01:02.499 --> 01:05.498
I imagine it's incredibly
frustrating for the parents

01:05.498 --> 01:08.498
because they're unable
to engage in sexual intercourse

01:08.499 --> 01:10.498
because their kids are there.

01:10.499 --> 01:11.700
- [laughing]
You know what?

01:12.499 --> 01:15.498
I never, ever really
pay attention to this matter.

01:15.499 --> 01:18.498
But...it's out there.

01:18.499 --> 01:20.020
<i>- Right now, the reason</i>

01:20.499 --> 01:22.498
<i>why parents don't want</i>
<i>to have sex while on vacation</i>

01:22.499 --> 01:24.499
<i>is because their children</i>
<i>will see and hear them,</i>

01:25.499 --> 01:26.498
<i>leading to permanent</i>
<i>developmental damage</i>

01:26.499 --> 01:28.498
<i>which can never be repaired.</i>

01:28.499 --> 01:32.498
<i>But if the Hilltop Hotel could</i>
<i>offer a portable soundproof box</i>

01:32.499 --> 01:34.498
<i>that completely</i>
<i>isolates the child</i>

01:34.499 --> 01:36.498
<i>from his parents' carnal acts,</i>

01:36.499 --> 01:38.498
<i>they'd quickly become</i>
<i>the top hotel choice</i>

01:38.499 --> 01:41.498
<i>for sexually active parents</i>
<i>traveling with their children.</i>

01:41.499 --> 01:42.499
<i>The plan:</i>

01:48.499 --> 01:52.498
- Then, it would still be
inside...the room.

01:52.499 --> 01:55.498
Is that what you're saying?
Oh, sorry.

01:55.499 --> 01:57.498
- You know, the best part
is kids wouldn't see this

01:57.499 --> 02:00.498
as some prison
they're forced into.

02:00.499 --> 02:02.498
It would be a fun isolation box

02:02.499 --> 02:05.498
that kids
of all ages would enjoy.

02:05.499 --> 02:07.498
- Um...

02:07.499 --> 02:13.498
If you put it that way,
theoretically, maybe.

02:13.499 --> 02:15.499
<i>- Kenny was beginning</i>
<i>to see the potential of my idea</i>

02:16.499 --> 02:18.498
<i>and even had some suggestions</i>
<i>of his own.</i>

02:18.499 --> 02:20.498
- Every single thing
that kids would love

02:20.499 --> 02:22.498
could go into that box.

02:22.499 --> 02:26.499
I mean, you know,
little flashlights, you know,

02:27.060 --> 02:30.498
little stars to, you know,
go off at night.

02:30.499 --> 02:31.498
<i>- But before committing</i>
<i>to anything,</i>

02:31.499 --> 02:34.498
<i>he wanted to see</i>
<i>a working prototype.</i>

02:34.499 --> 02:37.498
<i>So I got to work constructing</i>
<i>our first isolation chamber</i>

02:37.499 --> 02:38.498
<i>that would be large enough</i>

02:38.499 --> 02:41.498
<i>to house a child</i>
<i>up to 16 years of age.</i>

02:41.499 --> 02:44.498
<i>But since the most important</i>
<i>part was the soundproofing,</i>

02:44.499 --> 02:45.498
<i>we layered the inside walls</i>

02:45.499 --> 02:47.498
<i>with 6 inches</i>
<i>of rock wool batting</i>

02:47.499 --> 02:50.498
<i>and then added</i>
<i>a cork-lined inner chamber</i>

02:50.499 --> 02:53.498
<i>with a pressurized seal that</i>
<i>would eliminate vibrations.</i>

02:53.499 --> 02:55.498
<i>Because the box</i>
<i>had to be airtight,</i>

02:55.499 --> 02:58.498
<i>I also installed a</i>
<i>self-contained breathing system</i>

02:58.499 --> 03:01.498
<i>that would pump oxygen in</i>
<i>while scrubbing out the CO2</i>

03:01.499 --> 03:03.498
<i>so the child wouldn't</i>
<i>suffocate.</i>

03:03.499 --> 03:04.498
<i>And as a final precaution,</i>

03:04.499 --> 03:06.498
<i>I created</i>
<i>a rainforest soundscape</i>

03:06.499 --> 03:09.498
<i>to play inside the box</i>
<i>with custom animal calls</i>

03:09.499 --> 03:10.498
<i>that would hopefully camouflage</i>

03:10.499 --> 03:13.498
<i>any sex noises</i>
<i>that happened to get through.</i>

03:13.499 --> 03:16.498
Ooh-ooh-ee-ee-ah-ahh....

03:16.499 --> 03:17.498
[grunting]
Ruh-ruh-ah...

03:17.499 --> 03:20.498
Oooooooh...

03:20.499 --> 03:22.498
<i>With every precaution taken</i>

03:22.499 --> 03:25.498
<i>and the box now decorated</i>
<i>to make it exciting for kids,</i>

03:25.499 --> 03:27.499
<i>it seemed like our prototype</i>
<i>was complete.</i>

03:27.820 --> 03:30.498
<i>But I knew</i>
<i>that if even one sex noise</i>

03:30.499 --> 03:32.498
<i>happened to get through</i>
<i>to the inside,</i>

03:32.499 --> 03:35.498
<i>the Hilltop could be liable for</i>
<i>traumatizing an innocent child.</i>

03:35.499 --> 03:38.498
<i>So after setting up the box</i>
<i>in one of their suites,</i>

03:38.499 --> 03:40.498
<i>I hired</i>
<i>two pornographic performers</i>

03:40.499 --> 03:44.498
<i>to help me test it out</i>
<i>under real-life circumstances.</i>

03:44.499 --> 03:47.498
Do you normally start,
like, kissing a little bit,

03:47.499 --> 03:49.498
and then it
gets more and more or--

03:49.499 --> 03:51.498
- It kind
of depends on the scene.

03:51.499 --> 03:53.498
I mean, usually, like,
sometimes, there's kissing.

03:53.499 --> 03:55.498
Sometimes, it just
goes straight to blowjob.

03:55.499 --> 03:57.498
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

03:57.499 --> 03:59.498
<i>- While Tony and Holly</i>
<i>got ready in the bathroom,</i>

03:59.499 --> 04:00.820
<i>I brought in</i>
<i>our test subject...</i>

04:01.499 --> 04:02.498
Hey.
- Hi.

04:02.499 --> 04:04.498
- How's it going? I'm Nathan.
Nice to meet you.

04:04.499 --> 04:06.498
<i>An eight-year-old child actor</i>
<i>named Bradley.</i>

04:06.499 --> 04:08.498
- What the heck?

04:08.499 --> 04:10.499
- Pretty cool fort, huh?
- Yeah.

04:11.220 --> 04:12.498
<i>- Bradley loved the box.</i>

04:12.499 --> 04:14.499
<i>And after helping him in</i>
<i>and showing him how to alert me</i>

04:15.380 --> 04:16.498
<i>in case of an emergency...</i>

04:16.499 --> 04:17.498
[alarm beeps]

04:17.499 --> 04:19.498
You see?
That light?

04:19.499 --> 04:23.498
<i>I sealed him inside</i>
<i>the chamber...</i>

04:23.499 --> 04:25.498
<i>making sure there was no way</i>
<i>he could get out on his own</i>

04:25.499 --> 04:28.498
<i>and ruin his innocence.</i>

04:28.499 --> 04:29.498
<i>Even though Bradley's parents</i>

04:29.499 --> 04:31.499
<i>were fully aware</i>
<i>of what was about to happen,</i>

04:32.499 --> 04:34.498
<i>they still insisted on</i>
<i>being present during the test.</i>

04:34.499 --> 04:36.498
So I just want to be
clear with you guys.

04:36.499 --> 04:38.498
Because this is a test,

04:38.499 --> 04:41.498
I'm gonna have the performers
go at each other pretty hard.

04:41.499 --> 04:43.498
- Okay.

04:43.499 --> 04:45.498
- Okay.
<i>- And with that,</i>

04:45.499 --> 04:48.498
<i>I brought Jurgen and Marie into</i>
<i>the room so we could begin.</i>

04:48.499 --> 04:50.498
Are you guys ready?
- Yeah.

04:50.499 --> 04:52.498
- Okay. Whenever you're ready.
- Oh, we're ready.

04:52.499 --> 04:54.499
- [murmurs]

04:57.499 --> 05:00.498
[both murmuring]
[kissing sounds]

05:00.499 --> 05:02.498
- I love you so much,
Marie.

05:02.499 --> 05:05.498
- Touch me where I like it,
Jurgen.

05:05.499 --> 05:09.498
- I gave them your names
to make it more realistic.

05:09.499 --> 05:10.499
- Okay.

05:13.499 --> 05:16.498
- Watch and learn, hon.
[laughs]

05:16.499 --> 05:17.498
- [moaning]
Oh...

05:17.499 --> 05:19.499
Oh, you like it when
I beg for that [bleep],

05:20.499 --> 05:21.498
don't you, Jurgen?

05:21.499 --> 05:22.498
[moans]
Ah!

05:22.499 --> 05:24.460
<i>- After a few minutes,</i>

05:24.499 --> 05:26.499
<i>the real Jurgen and Marie</i>
<i>decided to leave the room.</i>

05:28.499 --> 05:31.498
- There's an alert button.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:31.499 --> 05:33.498
Okay. I'll take care of him.
- Okay. Thanks.

05:33.499 --> 05:35.498
- See you, guys.

05:35.499 --> 05:36.499
<i>With Jurgen and Marie gone,</i>

05:37.499 --> 05:39.498
<i>I was left to monitor the rest</i>
<i>of the test on my own.</i>

05:39.499 --> 05:42.498
- [yelling]
Oh! Oh!

05:42.499 --> 05:43.499
[loud moaning]

05:44.499 --> 05:46.498
Oh, God, Jurgen!

05:46.499 --> 05:48.498
[both moaning]

05:48.499 --> 05:52.498
<i>[rainforest sounds playing]</i>

05:52.499 --> 05:54.498
<i>- Once I observed</i>
<i>the couple had climaxed,</i>

05:54.499 --> 05:56.498
<i>I knew it wasn't gonna</i>
<i>get any louder,</i>

05:56.499 --> 05:58.498
<i>so I had them finish up</i>

05:58.499 --> 06:00.498
<i>and brought in something</i>
<i>comfortable for them to put on.</i>

06:00.499 --> 06:02.498
<i>And with Holly and Tony</i>
<i>out of the room,</i>

06:02.499 --> 06:04.499
<i>it's time to see</i>
<i>if my box had worked.</i>

06:05.499 --> 06:07.498
So what was it like being
in outer space?

06:07.499 --> 06:10.498
- Fun.
- Did you...hear anything?

06:10.499 --> 06:12.498
- Animal noises.

06:12.499 --> 06:13.498
- Animal noises?

06:13.499 --> 06:14.498
Nothing besides that?

06:14.499 --> 06:16.498
- No.
- Nothing?

06:16.499 --> 06:17.498
- Nothing.

06:17.499 --> 06:19.498
<i>- My box had passed</i>
<i>an initial test.</i>

06:19.499 --> 06:21.498
<i>But with a child's mental</i>
<i>health on the line,</i>

06:21.499 --> 06:23.498
<i>I needed to make sure</i>
<i>it held up</i>

06:23.499 --> 06:25.498
<i>under even the most</i>
<i>extreme circumstances.</i>

06:25.499 --> 06:28.498
<i>So to put it through</i>
<i>the ultimate stress test,</i>

06:28.499 --> 06:31.498
<i>I arranged for</i>
<i>an additional five performers</i>

06:31.499 --> 06:34.498
<i>to join Tony and Holly</i>
<i>for a seven-person orgy.</i>

06:34.499 --> 06:36.498
So these are some of
my friends here.

06:36.499 --> 06:37.498
Just wanna say hi?

06:37.499 --> 06:38.498
all: Hi.
- Yeah.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.498
- Nice to meet you.
- Okay.

06:40.499 --> 06:42.499
You know the drill, right?
- Yeah.

06:42.620 --> 06:45.498
- Blast off.

06:45.499 --> 06:48.499
[loud moaning,
groaning]

06:50.499 --> 06:53.499
<i>- It was clear that if my box</i>
<i>could withstand this,</i>

06:54.499 --> 06:55.498
<i>it would hold up</i>
<i>in any situation</i>

06:55.499 --> 06:57.499
<i>a hotel client might get into.</i>

06:59.499 --> 07:02.498
<i>So after the 30-minute</i>
<i>group session concluded,</i>

07:02.499 --> 07:04.498
<i>I followed up one more time</i>
<i>with Bradley.</i>

07:04.499 --> 07:07.499
So, uh...how was that?

07:09.499 --> 07:10.498
- Awesome.

07:10.499 --> 07:13.498
- Did you hear
anything strange this time?

07:13.499 --> 07:14.499
- No.
- Nothing?

07:14.580 --> 07:16.498
- Nothing.

07:16.499 --> 07:19.498
<i>- It worked. The box</i>
<i>was completely soundproof.</i>

07:19.499 --> 07:20.498
<i>And that meant I could finally</i>

07:20.499 --> 07:22.499
<i>return to Kenny</i>
<i>with undeniable proof</i>

07:23.499 --> 07:26.498
<i>that the product was ready</i>
<i>to be offered to his guests.</i>

07:26.499 --> 07:28.498
- Oh, is that--

07:28.499 --> 07:30.498
[laughs]
Wow.

07:30.499 --> 07:33.499
It looks like
a space shuttle.

07:35.499 --> 07:38.498
<i>- Oh, God, Jurgen!</i>

07:38.499 --> 07:40.498
<i>[both moaning loudly]</i>

07:40.499 --> 07:41.498
- So, as you can see,

07:41.499 --> 07:43.499
we tested it out
in every possible scenario...

07:44.499 --> 07:46.498
- Mm-hmm.
- From a couple making love

07:46.499 --> 07:49.498
to a seven-person
group engagement,

07:49.499 --> 07:51.498
and there was a child
in there the entire time...

07:51.499 --> 07:52.498
- Mm-hmm.

07:52.499 --> 07:53.498
- Who didn't hear anything.

07:53.499 --> 07:55.498
- Mm-hmm.
Okay.

07:55.499 --> 07:58.499
Wow. Um...

08:02.499 --> 08:03.498
Mm...

08:03.499 --> 08:06.498
- So I guess we'll leave the box
in the lobby,

08:06.499 --> 08:08.498
and just let me know
if you want to order any more.

08:08.499 --> 08:09.499
- Um...

08:10.499 --> 08:11.498
Thank you for the offer,
but--

08:11.499 --> 08:13.498
- You don't have to worry
about it--it's my gift to you.

08:13.499 --> 08:17.498
We'll just leave it
in the lobby.

08:17.499 --> 08:18.498
- Uh...all right.

08:18.499 --> 08:20.498
Leave it in the lobby, then.
Yeah.

09:04.074 --> 09:08.073
<i>that allows me to be on time</i>
<i>no matter how bad traffic gets.</i>

09:08.074 --> 09:10.073
<i>Whenever I'm on the road,</i>

09:10.074 --> 09:15.073
<i>I make sure to have two interns</i>
<i>follow me on a motorcycle.</i>

09:15.074 --> 09:17.073
<i>Then, the second</i>
<i>I hit any traffic,</i>

09:17.074 --> 09:18.073
<i>I give them a signal</i>
<i>out my window</i>

09:18.074 --> 09:20.074
<i>to approach</i>
<i>the side of the car.</i>

09:21.074 --> 09:22.073
<i>This is where a switch occurs,</i>

09:22.074 --> 09:25.073
<i>as my unpaid intern</i>
<i>takes my spot in the car</i>

09:25.074 --> 09:28.073
<i>while I quickly mount the back</i>
<i>of the motorcycle.</i>

09:28.074 --> 09:31.073
<i>And because it's legal</i>
<i>to split lanes in California,</i>

09:31.074 --> 09:33.073
<i>I'm able to speed</i>
<i>through the gridlock</i>

09:33.074 --> 09:36.073
<i>and get to where I'm going</i>
<i>without any delay whatsoever,</i>

09:36.074 --> 09:38.073
<i>leaving my unpaid intern</i>
<i>to wait in traffic</i>

09:38.074 --> 09:41.355
<i>and eventually deliver my car</i>
<i>to my destination.</i>

09:42.074 --> 09:43.073
<i>But the more I use the system,</i>

09:43.074 --> 09:45.073
<i>the more I notice</i>
<i>that others around me</i>

09:45.074 --> 09:48.073
<i>looked envious</i>
<i>of my ability to avoid traffic,</i>

09:48.074 --> 09:49.073
<i>and that's when I realized</i>

09:49.074 --> 09:51.073
<i>I might've accidentally</i>
<i>stumbled onto</i>

09:51.074 --> 09:53.073
<i>a major business opportunity.</i>

09:53.074 --> 09:56.073
<i>If I could arrange</i>
<i>for hundreds of motorcyclists</i>

09:56.074 --> 09:58.073
<i>throughout the city</i>
<i>to be on-call</i>

09:58.074 --> 10:01.073
<i>to fetch gridlocked drivers</i>
<i>at a moment's notice,</i>

10:01.074 --> 10:03.074
<i>I'd be able to help</i>
<i>everyone avoid traffic,</i>

10:04.074 --> 10:07.073
<i>and my gridlock rescue concept</i>
<i>could become a national hit.</i>

10:07.074 --> 10:09.073
<i>But to do this</i>
<i>would take some work,</i>

10:09.074 --> 10:11.073
<i>so we'll check back with this</i>
<i>in a bit.</i>

10:11.074 --> 10:12.073
<i>But first...</i>

10:12.074 --> 10:15.073
<i>Rose Ilandrian</i>
<i>is a travel agent</i>

10:15.074 --> 10:18.073
<i>and the owner of Glendale,</i>
<i>California's Travelure By Rose.</i>

10:18.074 --> 10:20.073
<i>But in this internet age,</i>

10:20.074 --> 10:22.073
<i>she's seen</i>
<i>her longstanding business</i>

10:22.074 --> 10:24.073
<i>crippled by modern technology.</i>

10:24.074 --> 10:26.073
- All of a sudden,
internet came

10:26.074 --> 10:29.073
and everybody's--they're going
directly to the internet.

10:29.074 --> 10:31.073
<i>- And because of this,</i>
<i>her customers have dwindled</i>

10:31.074 --> 10:33.074
<i>to the last holdouts</i>
<i>of the information age--</i>

10:34.074 --> 10:36.073
<i>the oldest of the old.</i>

10:36.074 --> 10:39.073
<i>So I paid Rose a visit</i>
<i>with a really good solution.</i>

10:39.074 --> 10:42.073
<i>You see, pretty soon,</i>
<i>Rose's customers will be so old</i>

10:42.074 --> 10:44.073
<i>that the only travel they'll be</i>
<i>interested in planning</i>

10:44.074 --> 10:46.073
<i>is their trip into the ground.</i>

10:46.074 --> 10:48.073
[thud]
- Oh, no!

10:48.074 --> 10:51.073
<i>- So if Rose were to capitalize</i>
<i>on her giant rolodex of elders</i>

10:51.074 --> 10:53.073
<i>by helping</i>
<i>them book their funerals,</i>

10:53.074 --> 10:55.073
<i>she'd open up</i>
<i>a whole new stream of revenue</i>

10:55.074 --> 10:58.073
<i>from coffin sales</i>
<i>and grave plots.</i>

10:58.074 --> 11:01.073
<i>The plan: for Rose to</i>
<i>transition her travel agency</i>

11:01.074 --> 11:04.073
<i>into a full-service</i>
<i>funeral home.</i>

11:04.074 --> 11:06.073
- What are you talking?

11:06.074 --> 11:08.073
- I mean, even you acknowledged
the business is gonna die.

11:08.074 --> 11:09.073
- Yes.
- Travel agents

11:09.074 --> 11:11.073
aren't gonna
be around much longer.

11:11.074 --> 11:12.073
- My opinion.

11:12.074 --> 11:13.073
- Your opinion?
- Yes.

11:13.074 --> 11:15.073
- So this is
a last-ditch effort

11:15.074 --> 11:18.074
to squeeze out as much
as you can from your customers

11:19.074 --> 11:20.073
before they're gone for good.

11:20.074 --> 11:22.073
- Hmm.

11:22.074 --> 11:24.073
<i>- Rose seemed interested</i>
<i>in the prospect</i>

11:24.074 --> 11:26.073
<i>of making money</i>
<i>from her dying customers.</i>

11:26.074 --> 11:28.073
<i>But since neither of us knew</i>
<i>how the funeral business</i>

11:28.074 --> 11:31.073
<i>actually operated,</i>
<i>I booked us an appointment</i>

11:31.074 --> 11:34.073
<i>at one of the area's</i>
<i>most popular funeral homes.</i>

11:34.074 --> 11:36.073
<i>Not wanting to tip off</i>
<i>that we were a new competitor</i>

11:36.074 --> 11:38.073
<i>looking for trade secrets,</i>

11:38.074 --> 11:41.073
<i>I convinced Rose to pose</i>
<i>as my dying wife</i>

11:41.074 --> 11:42.073
<i>whose funeral</i>
<i>we were looking to plan</i>

11:42.074 --> 11:44.073
<i>before she bites the dust.</i>

11:44.074 --> 11:46.073
Okay. Show me
how you're gonna act in there.

11:46.074 --> 11:48.074
- What do you want?
I mean, like this...

11:49.074 --> 11:50.074
- Yeah.
That's realistic kind of sick.

11:51.074 --> 11:52.073
It's almost dead--okay.
Good.

11:52.074 --> 11:54.073
- But I'm a very strong lady.
- Yeah, you're strong

11:54.074 --> 11:57.073
in real life, but for this,
you're pretending to be sick.

11:57.074 --> 11:58.074
- Okay.

11:59.074 --> 12:00.073
<i>- So we headed into our meeting</i>

12:00.074 --> 12:01.635
<i>with funeral director</i>
<i>Breanna Gallagher</i>

12:02.074 --> 12:05.073
<i>to find out everything we could</i>
<i>about their business model.</i>

12:05.074 --> 12:08.073
Sadly, uh, my wife, Rose,

12:08.074 --> 12:11.073
has come down with Klein's
and she's on her way out,

12:11.074 --> 12:15.073
so we're trying to make
arrangements for the day.

12:15.074 --> 12:17.073
- Sure.
- So whatever, you know,

12:17.074 --> 12:19.074
options you have and can
run through kind of

12:20.074 --> 12:22.073
everything you offer,
that would be really helpful

12:22.074 --> 12:24.073
for us to make our decision.

12:24.074 --> 12:25.074
- Absolutely.

12:27.074 --> 12:29.073
<i>- With the funeral director</i>
<i>buying our story,</i>

12:29.074 --> 12:32.073
<i>she walked me through all their</i>
<i>products and services,</i>

12:32.074 --> 12:34.635
<i>and I was sure to take note</i>
<i>of everything.</i>

12:35.074 --> 12:37.074
And can I ask, uh, who your
distributor is for these?

12:38.074 --> 12:40.073
- Aurora.
We use Aurora caskets.

12:40.074 --> 12:41.073
- Aurora?
- Yes.

12:41.074 --> 12:42.074
<i>- My plan was working</i>

12:42.955 --> 12:44.073
<i>to get Rose the information</i>
<i>she needed,</i>

12:44.074 --> 12:46.073
<i>but I was surprised to learn</i>

12:46.074 --> 12:49.073
<i>that the business was trending</i>
<i>away from caskets altogether.</i>

12:49.074 --> 12:51.073
- Cremation is on the rise
right now.

12:51.074 --> 12:53.073
<i>- It was clear</i>
<i>that if Rose wanted to compete,</i>

12:53.074 --> 12:56.074
<i>she'd need to be able to offer</i>
<i>cremation to her customers.</i>

12:57.074 --> 12:58.073
<i>But when I looked online,</i>

12:58.074 --> 13:00.073
<i>I discovered</i>
<i>that cremation furnaces</i>

13:00.074 --> 13:02.073
<i>were ridiculously expensive,</i>

13:02.074 --> 13:04.073
<i>and the only ovens that seemed</i>
<i>to be in her price range</i>

13:04.074 --> 13:06.073
<i>were ones that cooked pizzas.</i>

13:06.074 --> 13:08.073
<i>But before suggesting</i>
<i>this to Rose,</i>

13:08.074 --> 13:11.073
<i>I needed to be sure</i>
<i>it could incinerate a body.</i>

13:11.074 --> 13:13.073
<i>So I contacted a local pizzeria</i>

13:13.074 --> 13:16.073
<i>and asked if I could do a test</i>
<i>in one of their ovens.</i>

13:16.074 --> 13:18.073
<i>Obviously,</i>
<i>I couldn't use a real cadaver,</i>

13:18.074 --> 13:21.073
<i>so I structured a makeshift</i>
<i>body out of dough</i>

13:21.074 --> 13:23.073
<i>and filled the insides</i>
<i>with pork bones</i>

13:23.074 --> 13:24.073
<i>and whatever stuff I could</i>

13:24.074 --> 13:28.073
<i>to make the anatomy</i>
<i>as close to human as possible.</i>

13:28.074 --> 13:30.073
<i>And once it was done,</i>
<i>we wrapped it up</i>

13:30.074 --> 13:32.073
<i>and headed over</i>
<i>to Burbank Pizzeria</i>

13:32.074 --> 13:34.074
<i>to see if their oven</i>
<i>would burn it to a crisp.</i>

13:35.074 --> 13:37.073
- I was told it was just
a calzone you were gonna cook.

13:37.074 --> 13:40.073
I wasn't sure that this was
gonna be this big of a deal

13:40.074 --> 13:43.073
with clothing and cloth
and leather and hair

13:43.074 --> 13:45.073
and stuff like that,
so...

13:45.074 --> 13:47.074
Okay, but if we take off
the clothing, then it's okay?

13:48.074 --> 13:51.073
- I think it would be best
if you want to cook it.

13:51.074 --> 13:52.073
<i>- After a brief negotiation,</i>

13:52.074 --> 13:55.074
<i>George allowed me to continue</i>
<i>as long as we put him in naked.</i>

13:56.074 --> 13:57.073
<i>[cheerful music]</i>

13:57.074 --> 13:59.073
<i>So once all the clothes</i>
<i>were removed,</i>

13:59.074 --> 14:01.073
<i>George and I delicately</i>
<i>loaded the body</i>

14:01.074 --> 14:04.073
<i>into the 650-degree oven,</i>

14:04.074 --> 14:07.074
<i>and then all there was left</i>
<i>to do was wait.</i>

14:14.074 --> 14:16.073
Are you, uh,
are you married?

14:16.074 --> 14:17.073
- Yup.

14:17.074 --> 14:20.073
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

14:20.074 --> 14:22.073
Are you married?

14:22.074 --> 14:25.074
- No. No.

14:28.074 --> 14:30.074
- I'm gonna get me some water.

14:34.599 --> 14:37.098
<i>- After 1 1/2 hours,</i>
<i>George had to open up his shop.</i>

14:37.099 --> 14:40.098
<i>So he made me take out the body</i>
<i>before it was fully burnt,</i>

14:40.099 --> 14:43.098
<i>but he seemed confident</i>
<i>that this would work.</i>

14:43.099 --> 14:45.098
A few more hours, would it
all just burn to a crisp?

14:45.099 --> 14:46.099
- Yup.
- Would that work the same

14:47.099 --> 14:48.098
for a human body too?

14:48.099 --> 14:52.098
- Well, anything in that heat
eventually will burn, yeah.

14:52.099 --> 14:54.098
<i>- With the success</i>
<i>of my scientific experiment,</i>

14:54.099 --> 14:56.098
<i>I now knew that Rose</i>
<i>would be able</i>

14:56.099 --> 14:58.098
<i>to offer cremations</i>
<i>on a budget.</i>

14:58.099 --> 15:00.098
<i>So I dressed up</i>
<i>her waiting area</i>

15:00.099 --> 15:02.098
<i>with marketing materials</i>

15:02.099 --> 15:05.098
<i>that would showcase all the new</i>
<i>services that were available.</i>

15:05.099 --> 15:07.098
<i>And with that,</i>
<i>it was time to see if Rose</i>

15:07.099 --> 15:09.098
<i>could convince customers</i>
<i>to plan their funerals</i>

15:09.099 --> 15:11.098
<i>with Travelure.</i>

15:11.099 --> 15:15.098
- I'd like to go again
to Las Vegas, Nevada.

15:15.099 --> 15:17.099
<i>- After handling</i>
<i>the customer's travel needs,</i>

15:18.099 --> 15:20.098
<i>I then had Rose</i>
<i>bring up the new service.</i>

15:20.099 --> 15:25.099
- And we sell, sorry I'm telling
you this one, funeral packages.

15:25.900 --> 15:28.098
- Oh, yeah. Okay.

15:28.099 --> 15:29.098
All right. Yeah.

15:29.099 --> 15:32.099
- If you are ready
or you have the plans...

15:33.099 --> 15:36.098
like, we prepare
all these packages.

15:36.099 --> 15:37.098
- Um...

15:37.099 --> 15:40.098
I don't have plans
in that area right now, though,

15:40.099 --> 15:42.098
but yeah.
It's good to know, yeah.

15:42.099 --> 15:44.098
I need to know just in case.
- Yes.

15:44.099 --> 15:47.098
Whenever you need that,
just let me know.

15:47.099 --> 15:49.098
- Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

15:49.099 --> 15:51.098
Sure. Sure.

15:51.099 --> 15:54.098
<i>- But unfortunately,</i>
<i>the customer wasn't interested.</i>

15:54.099 --> 15:55.098
<i>And after that,</i>

15:55.099 --> 15:57.098
<i>Rose started having</i>
<i>second thoughts.</i>

15:57.099 --> 16:00.098
- It has to come from my heart.

16:00.099 --> 16:01.098
I have to like what I'm doing.

16:01.099 --> 16:03.099
- So it's not quite
for you?

16:04.099 --> 16:05.098
- I can do it, but, again,

16:05.099 --> 16:08.098
it's not from my heart.

16:08.099 --> 16:09.098
- You know, it's funny.

16:09.099 --> 16:11.098
All this talk
about funerals and stuff

16:11.099 --> 16:14.099
has really gotten me thinking
a lot about my own mortality,

16:15.099 --> 16:16.098
you know what I mean?

16:16.099 --> 16:17.098
- Yes.

16:17.099 --> 16:19.098
- It makes you realize
that at the end of the day,

16:19.099 --> 16:21.098
it's not about how much
money you make

16:21.099 --> 16:24.098
or...how many girls
you've slept with.

16:24.099 --> 16:27.098
It's about the little moments
that are nice.

16:27.099 --> 16:30.098
- Very nice.
- Like this.

16:30.099 --> 16:33.098
- Yeah. This is one.
This moment is very good.

16:33.099 --> 16:34.099
- Good luck with everything,
Rose.

16:35.099 --> 16:36.098
- Thank you, too, Nathan.

16:36.099 --> 16:38.098
Thank you. Thank you.

16:38.099 --> 16:41.099
- Yeah. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

16:42.099 --> 16:44.099
Good-bye.

16:46.524 --> 16:48.523
<i>- Earlier, you saw me</i>
<i>come up with an idea</i>

16:48.524 --> 16:49.765
<i>to rescue people from gridlock.</i>

16:50.524 --> 16:52.523
<i>But to see if this would work</i>
<i>as an actual service,</i>

16:52.524 --> 16:54.523
<i>I'd first need to recruit</i>
<i>motorcyclists</i>

16:54.524 --> 16:56.523
<i>that were interested</i>
<i>in being riders.</i>

16:56.524 --> 16:59.523
<i>Knowing that bikers</i>
<i>have a pack mentality,</i>

16:59.524 --> 17:00.523
<i>I thought I'd have</i>
<i>the best chance</i>

17:00.524 --> 17:02.523
<i>of gaining their interest</i>

17:02.524 --> 17:03.523
<i>if they thought</i>
<i>I was one of them.</i>

17:03.524 --> 17:06.522
[wolf whistle]

17:06.523 --> 17:07.522
<i>So I headed to</i>
<i>a local biker bar</i>

17:07.523 --> 17:10.522
<i>with the goal of recruiting</i>
<i>couples who ride together</i>

17:10.523 --> 17:12.522
<i>to take part in my service.</i>

17:12.523 --> 17:15.522
<i>And after spending some time</i>
<i>doing my best to blend in...</i>

17:15.523 --> 17:16.523
[groans]
Ugh.

17:16.525 --> 17:19.522
My life.

17:19.523 --> 17:21.522
<i>I met a biker couple</i>
<i>named Sean and Laura</i>

17:21.523 --> 17:23.522
<i>who seemed interested</i>
<i>in my idea.</i>

17:23.523 --> 17:24.523
I'm working
on a business opportunity,

17:24.845 --> 17:27.522
and I'm looking for couples
that know how to ride.

17:27.523 --> 17:29.523
<i>So the next day,</i>
<i>I brought them into my office</i>

17:29.524 --> 17:31.523
<i>to see if they'd be</i>
<i>right for the job.</i>

17:31.524 --> 17:33.523
To launch this, you know,

17:33.524 --> 17:35.523
I'm looking for strong couples
because, you know,

17:35.524 --> 17:37.523
if I hire you guys
and you break up,

17:37.524 --> 17:38.523
you're kind of useless
to me.

17:38.524 --> 17:40.523
- Right.
- So I should ask.

17:40.524 --> 17:43.523
Are there any issues
in the relationship at all?

17:43.524 --> 17:45.523
- I think
we're pretty solid.

17:45.524 --> 17:47.523
I mean, I'm not--

17:47.524 --> 17:49.523
- I'm not looking to go
see anybody else, so...

17:49.524 --> 17:51.523
- Not really.
- Okay.

17:51.524 --> 17:55.523
If I hire you, and God forbid,
you guys do break up,

17:55.524 --> 17:57.523
how quickly do you think
you'd be able

17:57.524 --> 17:58.523
to get into
a new relationship?

17:58.524 --> 18:01.524
- [laughs] That's a--
That's--[stammers]

18:02.524 --> 18:03.523
I wouldn't be
able to answer that.

18:03.524 --> 18:05.523
Sometimes it's been years.

18:05.524 --> 18:06.523
Sometimes it's been
the next day, you know?

18:06.524 --> 18:08.523
It's--
- The next day?

18:08.524 --> 18:09.523
- I have done it
in a day.

18:09.524 --> 18:13.523
I've done two in a day.
[laughing]

18:13.524 --> 18:15.523
- What does
that mean?

18:15.524 --> 18:16.523
- Um...

18:16.524 --> 18:18.523
- Yeah.
What does that mean?

18:18.524 --> 18:19.524
- I had too much fun in one day
with two different women.

18:20.524 --> 18:21.523
- Like, a threesome?

18:21.524 --> 18:22.523
- No. It was separate.

18:22.524 --> 18:25.523
In the same--same day,

18:25.524 --> 18:28.523
at the same party,
but no, not together.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.523
- So you had sex with one woman,
then another right after?

18:30.524 --> 18:32.523
- Pretty much.
- Okay.

18:32.524 --> 18:35.523
So if this
relationship ends,

18:35.524 --> 18:37.524
you'll find someone
pretty quick.

18:38.524 --> 18:40.523
- Sure.
- Okay.

18:40.524 --> 18:42.523
I mean,
you guys seem great.

18:42.524 --> 18:43.524
<i>With Laura and Sean on board,</i>

18:44.325 --> 18:46.523
<i>I was one step closer</i>
<i>to my gridlock rescue service</i>

18:46.524 --> 18:48.523
<i>becoming a reality.</i>

18:48.524 --> 18:49.524
<i>But before launching this,</i>

18:50.524 --> 18:52.523
<i>I needed to see if there was</i>
<i>interest from actual commuters.</i>

18:52.524 --> 18:55.523
<i>So I sent Sean and Laura</i>
<i>out into rush hour traffic</i>

18:55.524 --> 18:58.524
<i>to see if the public</i>
<i>would embrace my idea.</i>

19:00.524 --> 19:01.725
- Roll down your window.

19:02.524 --> 19:03.805
How you doing today?

19:04.524 --> 19:05.523
We're offering
a service.

19:05.524 --> 19:07.523
My girlfriend would be
more than happy

19:07.524 --> 19:09.523
to drive your car
to wherever you're going.

19:09.524 --> 19:10.523
You can get on the back
of the bike,

19:10.524 --> 19:13.524
and we'll get you there
a whole lot quicker.

19:14.205 --> 19:15.523
All right.

19:15.524 --> 19:18.523
<i>- I was surprised that people</i>
<i>weren't receptive to my idea.</i>

19:18.524 --> 19:19.523
- Just tell me
where you want to go.

19:19.524 --> 19:20.524
We'll take you.

19:21.485 --> 19:22.524
I-I know you don't
want to do it,

19:23.524 --> 19:25.523
but please don't disrespect me
while I'm talking to you.

19:25.524 --> 19:27.524
Hop on the bike!

19:32.524 --> 19:34.523
- All right.
- Go.

19:34.524 --> 19:35.523
<i>- And in that moment,</i>
<i>for the first time,</i>

19:35.524 --> 19:39.523
<i>I finally realized</i>
<i>the fatal flaw in my concept.</i>

19:39.524 --> 19:41.523
<i>In this post-Pearl Harbor</i>
<i>world,</i>

19:41.524 --> 19:44.523
<i>people don't trust their fellow</i>
<i>man the way they once did.</i>

19:44.524 --> 19:46.524
- People are just so scared
and afraid

19:47.165 --> 19:49.523
of the unknown that once
they shut their mind off,

19:49.524 --> 19:51.523
it's really hard
to open it up.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.523
- Exactly.

19:53.524 --> 19:54.523
<i>- It was a sad conclusion</i>

19:54.524 --> 19:57.523
<i>to what I thought</i>
<i>was a revolutionary idea.</i>

19:57.524 --> 19:59.523
<i>But at least we could celebrate</i>
<i>that we gave it our all</i>

19:59.524 --> 20:00.523
<i>as a team.</i>

20:00.524 --> 20:02.524
- What are you guys
doing later tonight?

20:03.524 --> 20:05.523
- Well, I'm taking her out
to get something to eat.

20:05.524 --> 20:06.523
- Oh.
Where are you guys gonna go?

20:06.524 --> 20:08.523
- I don't know yet.
Maybe fish.

20:08.524 --> 20:10.523
- Fish?
- Crab.

20:10.524 --> 20:11.523
- Oh. Sounds good.

20:11.524 --> 20:13.523
Would you like to--
me to come too?

20:13.524 --> 20:14.524
We could all have a--

20:15.524 --> 20:16.523
- No. I think we're good.

20:16.524 --> 20:19.523
- Okay. You guys--
it's like just for you guys?

20:19.524 --> 20:21.205
- Yeah.
No. I'm taking my lady out.

20:21.524 --> 20:22.523
I...don't really
need any company with me.

20:22.524 --> 20:24.523
- Okay. Sure.
I mean, I wouldn't want to be

20:24.524 --> 20:25.524
a third wheel, you know?

20:26.524 --> 20:27.523
- That's what it would be,
so...

20:27.524 --> 20:29.523
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

20:29.524 --> 20:31.523
- Well, it's great working
with you guys.

20:31.524 --> 20:33.523
- Nice working with you, too.
- Yes.

20:33.524 --> 20:34.523
<i>In the end, Sean and Laura</i>

20:34.524 --> 20:37.523
<i>weren't that different</i>

20:37.524 --> 20:41.523
<i>too afraid of the unknown</i>

20:41.524 --> 20:43.523
<i>But, brother,</i>

20:56.524 --> 20:58.524
- Abso...lutely.

21:00.871 --> 21:03.670
- Highway blues.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

21:03.671 --> 21:06.670
- It's okay.
- We've all been there.

21:06.671 --> 21:08.670
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

21:08.671 --> 21:09.670
[deep inhale]

21:09.671 --> 21:11.671
Life alone on the road.
