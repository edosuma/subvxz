WEBVTT

00:07.291 --> 00:08.666
He's so cute.

00:08.750 --> 00:09.833
TWO YEARS LATER

00:09.916 --> 00:12.000
-You're lucky he's not ugly.
-Yeah.

00:12.083 --> 00:13.583
Because it's a real lottery.

00:13.666 --> 00:16.958
Even if the parents are attractive.
He looks a little like you.

00:17.041 --> 00:18.250
-You think?
-Yeah.

00:19.125 --> 00:22.041
Have you already told him
about how you got him?

00:22.125 --> 00:24.916
-I'm waiting until he can understand.
-Not at all.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.500
Right now, he's feeling everything.
It's worse.

00:27.583 --> 00:29.083
I thought you read the books.

00:29.166 --> 00:32.125
Yeah, I did, but Julio needs to be there.

00:32.208 --> 00:34.541
Yeah, if you want him
to like his father best.

00:34.625 --> 00:36.625
Okay, I'll talk to him now.

00:36.708 --> 00:39.333
So, my perfect little prince.

00:39.416 --> 00:40.750
No, don't call him…

00:41.291 --> 00:43.500
"My perfect little prince"? Okay.

00:43.583 --> 00:45.500
I don't know where to start.

00:45.583 --> 00:47.583
At the beginning. I mean…

00:48.416 --> 00:49.666
Okay.

00:50.458 --> 00:51.791
So, my little darling…

00:51.875 --> 00:54.375
<i>-Once upon a time, your mommy…</i>
-Hi.

00:54.458 --> 00:55.375
FOUR YEARS AGO

00:55.458 --> 00:59.125
<i>…who, by a great coincidence,</i>
<i>found herself in front of a handsome boy.</i>

00:59.208 --> 01:00.958
Here. In one piece.

01:01.041 --> 01:04.166
<i>-Coincidence. It's mostly thanks to us.</i>
<i>-Shut up.</i>

01:04.250 --> 01:06.708
And sorry about earlier, on the phone.

01:06.791 --> 01:08.666
No, don't worry. I'm Jules.

01:09.250 --> 01:10.166
Jules Dupont.

01:11.250 --> 01:12.375
Is that a pseudonym?

01:12.458 --> 01:14.583
<i>Yes, because Daddy was a man whore.</i>

01:14.666 --> 01:16.041
<i>No, quit it. Shh.</i>

01:16.125 --> 01:18.833
Can't you tell him
something that involves us?

01:18.916 --> 01:20.541
About where he comes from?

01:20.625 --> 01:22.916
Like when Cha offered to give you her…

01:23.000 --> 01:26.333
Because of chemo,
they insist I freeze my eggs.

01:26.416 --> 01:27.916
Either they go to waste, or…

01:29.708 --> 01:31.125
they're useful to someone.

01:31.208 --> 01:32.416
Hang on.

01:32.500 --> 01:33.750
If I'm following, you--

01:33.833 --> 01:35.708
I'll lend them. I mean, donate them.

01:36.833 --> 01:39.583
Because basically,
men are <i>terminado</i> for me.

01:39.666 --> 01:42.208
Kids, I don't want any.
I have other priorities.

01:42.291 --> 01:44.375
I give you my eggs, and you make a baby.

01:44.458 --> 01:45.458
Yeah, but…

01:45.541 --> 01:47.625
-Charlotte, it's--
-You can't say no.

01:48.125 --> 01:50.250
Think about those little eggs

01:50.333 --> 01:52.375
waiting in the cold at the clinic.

01:52.458 --> 01:53.583
"Elsa, come get me."

01:53.666 --> 01:56.291
And it's risk-free. This is premium DNA.

01:56.375 --> 01:59.708
It's DNA plus. Even more! Plus.

01:59.791 --> 02:03.666
Hang on. So, if you give
Elsa your eggs, that means--

02:03.750 --> 02:06.541
Biologically speaking,
you'd be making a baby with Julio.

02:06.625 --> 02:09.375
Symbolically, you'd have slept
with all the guys in the gang.

02:09.958 --> 02:11.125
Except your brother.

02:12.375 --> 02:13.791
Relax, I'm kidding.

02:14.375 --> 02:16.541
No. Come on. It's a genius idea.

02:16.625 --> 02:19.833
It's also kind of a shitty idea.
It's complicated.

02:19.916 --> 02:24.000
-It's one of Chacha's ideas.
-It's so sweet, Chacha, but I don't know…

02:24.083 --> 02:26.333
There are no ifs or buts about it!
It's sweet!

02:26.416 --> 02:28.958
-Yeah.
-We'll make a baby between friends!

02:29.958 --> 02:32.708
And not just any baby.
A real heartbreaker.

02:32.791 --> 02:34.041
Let me see?

02:34.125 --> 02:35.708
She's got Julio's frizzy hair.

02:38.208 --> 02:40.375
We'll straighten it. Milou could carry it!

02:41.583 --> 02:43.750
I'm not sure we should have started there.

02:44.250 --> 02:45.708
A NETFLIX SERIES

02:47.166 --> 02:49.000
THE LAME PLAN

02:49.083 --> 02:50.708
THE CRAZY PLAN

02:50.791 --> 02:52.708
THE BOOTY PLAN

02:52.791 --> 02:54.750
THE HOOK-UP PLAN

02:54.833 --> 02:57.666
Eddy, your nose is snotty.
Come blow your nose.

02:57.750 --> 02:59.666
Skip forward to Christmas.

02:59.750 --> 03:02.750
But I was putting things in context.
You told me to--

03:02.833 --> 03:04.708
-We need to move it along.
-Right.

03:05.291 --> 03:06.291
Julio's surprise.

03:07.833 --> 03:08.708
Julio's surprise.

03:09.958 --> 03:11.250
<i>-Your daddy…</i>
<i>-Already bored.</i>

03:11.333 --> 03:12.166
TWO YEARS AGO

03:12.250 --> 03:14.125
<i>…wanted to cheer me up because I was--</i>

03:14.208 --> 03:15.750
<i>-Infertile.</i>
<i>-Yes, okay.</i>

03:16.333 --> 03:18.250
<i>Anyway, to cheer me up…</i>

03:18.958 --> 03:21.583
What? Oh my… This?

03:33.333 --> 03:34.375
<i>Hi, Elsa-Elsa.</i>

03:35.125 --> 03:37.208
<i>-Julio, are you okay?</i>
<i>-</i>No, this is Jules.

03:37.291 --> 03:39.583
<i>It was a pleasure to see you</i>
<i>and return your phone.</i>

03:40.333 --> 03:43.916
I know you're a little out of it,
but that's what I like about you.

03:44.000 --> 03:44.958
<i>Hang on, but…</i>

03:45.583 --> 03:47.166
Oh. Right.

03:47.666 --> 03:49.666
Okay, you're reenacting the…

03:49.750 --> 03:51.708
<i>How you first met. We get it.</i>

03:51.791 --> 03:53.750
I'd really like to see you again.

03:54.541 --> 03:56.208
Listen,

03:56.958 --> 03:59.333
me too, I…

03:59.416 --> 04:01.208
Shit, what were my lines?

04:01.291 --> 04:03.333
<i>I don't know. "Suck you later"?</i>

04:03.416 --> 04:05.250
Make sure to go through your photos.

04:05.333 --> 04:07.791
Okay, all right. The photos.

04:08.791 --> 04:11.833
-Yes, I know. "See you later, alligator!"
<i>-Who says that?</i>

04:11.916 --> 04:14.166
-That's it.
-See you later, Elsa-Elsa.

04:14.250 --> 04:16.083
<i>Okay, I'll look at the photos.</i>

04:16.166 --> 04:17.333
<i>Love you. Kisses.</i>

04:17.416 --> 04:18.291
Kisses.

04:20.041 --> 04:21.291
The photos.

04:21.375 --> 04:22.958
MEET TONIGHT

04:23.041 --> 04:25.083
TO RETRACE OUR STORY…

04:28.041 --> 04:31.000
AT THE PARIS AQUARIUM AT 7:00 P.M.

04:33.250 --> 04:35.458
You're going to tell him
about the aquarium?

04:35.541 --> 04:37.166
-Yeah.
-Well, if you want.

04:37.250 --> 04:38.625
Talk about awkward…

04:38.708 --> 04:41.375
FOUR YEARS AGO

04:41.458 --> 04:43.916
-I really want you.
-Okay.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
-Really want you!
-Yeah, me too.

04:47.083 --> 04:48.833
-You coming?
-Okay.

04:49.375 --> 04:50.708
And then they had sex.

04:52.041 --> 04:55.958
I don't mean that time.
I'm talking about the second time.

04:56.041 --> 04:58.000
-But…
-Christmas two years ago.

04:58.875 --> 05:02.958
<i>-It has nothing to do with his birth.</i>
<i>-Yes, we made a decision.</i>

05:03.041 --> 05:04.833
-Hello, miss. Piggy.
-Hey, you.

05:04.916 --> 05:05.833
Nice photos.

05:05.916 --> 05:08.750
<i>He made me listen</i>
<i>to the new song he had composed for me.</i>

05:09.416 --> 05:11.791
I'm guessing the pig isn't the present.

05:12.458 --> 05:13.708
Another old recipe.

05:13.791 --> 05:15.458
<i>Can't he just give bracelets?</i>

05:15.541 --> 05:17.416
<i>Quit it. His song is a hit.</i>

05:17.500 --> 05:19.333
<i>A hit? According to who?</i>

05:25.041 --> 05:26.666
-You were working on this?
-Yeah.

05:26.750 --> 05:27.958
-It's beautiful.
-Really?

05:28.041 --> 05:28.875
Yeah.

05:28.958 --> 05:33.583
<i>It's crazy how this song</i>
<i>immediately made me relive our story.</i>

05:36.083 --> 05:38.041
<i>And it wasn't always rosy.</i>

05:38.875 --> 05:40.458
<i>Or always perfect.</i>

05:40.541 --> 05:41.791
Oh, look.

05:42.625 --> 05:43.833
They're dancing too.

05:43.916 --> 05:45.125
<i>But it was us.</i>

05:45.208 --> 05:46.166
I love it.

05:47.583 --> 05:48.833
<i>There's nothing stronger.</i>

05:48.916 --> 05:50.041
It's awesome.

06:56.458 --> 06:59.083
We got into the habit
of communicating through music.

07:00.791 --> 07:02.458
And it's worked out pretty well.

07:05.875 --> 07:06.750
You see?

07:07.916 --> 07:09.333
This is our song.

07:11.083 --> 07:12.333
It's our new start.

07:14.750 --> 07:16.708
Even if you're the only one who likes it…

07:17.458 --> 07:20.291
You know what? That's just fine with me.

07:24.583 --> 07:25.750
Did you say something?

07:28.208 --> 07:29.041
No, nothing.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.083
I love you.

07:32.541 --> 07:34.708
We will raise a child. I promise you.

07:34.791 --> 07:36.083
<i>Come on, go!</i>

07:36.166 --> 07:37.875
This is so cheesy.

07:37.958 --> 07:41.166
No. Thanks to that song,
the label asked him to make an album.

07:41.250 --> 07:43.833
But it doesn't teach him
about where he comes from.

07:43.916 --> 07:45.083
So…

07:45.166 --> 07:46.000
Come on.

07:46.083 --> 07:47.166
On Christmas Eve…

07:47.250 --> 07:48.333
Finally!

07:48.416 --> 07:49.583
TWO YEARS AGO

07:49.666 --> 07:51.625
-It's not complicated.
-I made a mistake.

07:51.708 --> 07:53.750
Antoine, am I stuffing
these turkeys by myself?

07:54.833 --> 07:57.375
-Antoine.
-Yes, my love. I'm coming.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.083
She's such a pain.

07:59.166 --> 08:01.625
You know,
I'm not at all in love with you anymore.

08:02.416 --> 08:04.083
That's right. The mermaid helped me.

08:04.958 --> 08:07.083
Because you and her…

08:07.166 --> 08:08.500
No, she's a friend.

08:09.125 --> 08:10.166
Nonsense.

08:10.708 --> 08:12.458
Actually, I realized that

08:12.541 --> 08:15.875
going from one girl to the next,
I needed to be fine on my own.

08:16.583 --> 08:17.416
Yeah, I know.

08:17.500 --> 08:18.541
Hello, kids!

08:18.625 --> 08:21.250
Is it true about
that project with the Green party?

08:21.333 --> 08:24.125
Yeah. You're voting for me, right?

08:24.208 --> 08:25.750
That depends on your program.

08:27.083 --> 08:28.125
Oh yeah?

08:28.208 --> 08:31.291
Well, my program
is for you to go fuck yourself.

08:31.958 --> 08:32.958
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

08:33.041 --> 08:35.416
We're on schedule
for the soup kitchen, right?

08:35.500 --> 08:38.416
It's going wonderfully, Mrs. Director.

08:38.500 --> 08:39.458
Oh shit.

08:40.791 --> 08:41.833
It's the shaman.

08:43.166 --> 08:44.875
-I'll take care of it.
-Okay.

08:45.875 --> 08:48.000
-Hello?
<i>-Hello? Yes, it's Briska.</i>

08:48.083 --> 08:49.791
<i>For the red moon ceremony.</i>

08:49.875 --> 08:53.250
No, Briska, we've decided
to celebrate Christmas with friends.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.458
<i>-Okay.</i>
-And with those in need.

08:55.541 --> 08:58.625
The red moon can wait.
We're going to try another way.

08:58.708 --> 09:01.166
<i>-Okay, </i>Feliz Natal!
-Merry Christmas.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.666
Namaste,<i> </i>Briska.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.541
<i>-Thumpi anpetu waste.</i>
<i>-Bye.</i>

09:04.625 --> 09:06.750
Who's the asshole who took my Yule log?

09:07.375 --> 09:09.208
Put it all in there, fuck!

09:09.291 --> 09:11.833
Last one.
We're not feeding them stuffing all week.

09:11.916 --> 09:14.500
I am putting everything.
This is the tenth one.

09:14.583 --> 09:15.750
Hey, I love you.

09:15.833 --> 09:16.958
It's funny, actually.

09:17.791 --> 09:20.166
The shittier it gets, the more I love you.

09:21.458 --> 09:24.125
By the way,
I wanted to tell you, last night was…

09:24.208 --> 09:25.833
-Was what?
-It was really great.

09:25.916 --> 09:26.916
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

09:27.583 --> 09:30.250
It was really great for me too.

09:30.333 --> 09:31.250
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

09:31.791 --> 09:33.666
If you want, after we get home…

09:34.250 --> 09:36.416
Or even before. Like that,

09:37.041 --> 09:37.958
now,

09:38.041 --> 09:39.125
my little turkey.

09:40.500 --> 09:42.041
-Okay.
-Yeah?

09:42.125 --> 09:43.500
My little Santa Claus,

09:44.208 --> 09:45.750
with his big sack.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.250
-Greedy.
-Always.

09:55.333 --> 09:57.416
How do you know that part?

09:57.500 --> 09:59.291
Quit interrupting. Let me finish.

09:59.375 --> 10:00.333
Okay.

10:00.416 --> 10:03.333
She was saying that
Daddy and Mommy really love each other.

10:03.416 --> 10:05.125
Okay, moving on.

10:05.208 --> 10:08.041
Get a move on.
The needy can't be eating at midnight.

10:08.125 --> 10:09.791
-Take the cooler, please.
-Yeah.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.166
-I got it.
-Thanks.

10:11.791 --> 10:12.875
Put it all inside.

10:14.333 --> 10:16.375
Is it true that you froze your eggs?

10:16.875 --> 10:17.875
What?

10:18.583 --> 10:20.625
Your eggs, did you freeze them?

10:21.458 --> 10:23.875
You really want to talk about this now?

10:23.958 --> 10:24.791
Yes.

10:24.875 --> 10:28.208
If you don't want to have a child,
what's the point?

10:28.291 --> 10:31.333
Well, it could help someone later.

10:34.166 --> 10:35.166
You okay?

10:36.916 --> 10:39.541
Ever since I've been staying
with Antoine and Milou,

10:39.625 --> 10:41.041
having a child, I mean…

10:42.041 --> 10:44.958
Okay, see, Eddy, I think he's cool.

10:45.041 --> 10:47.833
Well, he does have
some of my DNA, so I get it.

10:48.791 --> 10:53.333
Actually, speaking of DNA,
I'm not trying to influence you

10:53.416 --> 10:56.458
because every woman
has the right to not want children

10:56.541 --> 10:59.375
and the right to want them
and to change her mind.

10:59.458 --> 11:00.458
Nice.

11:01.833 --> 11:02.666
Very good.

11:03.458 --> 11:05.166
I'm going to help the others.

11:05.250 --> 11:07.500
Would you like to have a child?
As friends?

11:10.000 --> 11:14.250
I mean, obviously,
once you're cured and ready, but…

11:14.875 --> 11:16.625
Well, anyway, I'm ready.

11:17.208 --> 11:19.125
Ready. I'm ready.

11:20.333 --> 11:22.666
-Wait, are you being serious?
-Yeah.

11:27.208 --> 11:29.375
Don't tell me this cooler contains your…

11:29.458 --> 11:31.500
I've been jerking off in it for weeks.

11:32.166 --> 11:36.416
No! Fuck, it's a piece of Yule log
I stole from Emilie to give Eddy.

11:37.875 --> 11:39.333
He's part of the gang.

11:44.208 --> 11:45.041
You're sweet.

11:47.541 --> 11:48.458
You are ready.

11:55.416 --> 11:56.250
Fuck.

12:43.291 --> 12:44.916
<i>Enough with the dancing!</i>

12:45.000 --> 12:47.583
-Straight to the point, <i>girl.</i>
<i>-Right, sorry.</i>

12:53.041 --> 12:55.291
Sorry. I have something to tell you guys.

12:56.291 --> 12:57.125
Okay.

12:57.666 --> 12:58.500
So,

12:59.916 --> 13:01.250
I wanted to thank you.

13:01.750 --> 13:02.958
A big thank you.

13:04.416 --> 13:05.791
Because thanks to you,

13:06.541 --> 13:09.958
Piotr's canteen
has distributed 500 Christmas dinners.

13:16.041 --> 13:17.000
And that

13:18.416 --> 13:20.250
I couldn't have done it without you.

13:23.291 --> 13:24.125
Okay.

13:25.583 --> 13:27.375
Actually, life is incredible.

13:29.666 --> 13:32.333
We think there's only one way
to be a contented woman.

13:33.000 --> 13:33.916
Or man.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.458
Whereas…

13:38.166 --> 13:39.583
happiness is…

13:41.500 --> 13:43.458
more of a journey than a destination.

13:46.291 --> 13:47.958
Come here.

13:50.416 --> 13:53.750
So, Julio and I raise our glasses

13:55.250 --> 13:56.416
to you all.

13:56.500 --> 14:00.375
Also, we wanted
to announce that we decided to…

14:01.541 --> 14:03.583
Hello, my little constituents.

14:03.666 --> 14:05.000
No!

14:06.041 --> 14:08.625
-We're in the 18th district.
-Practically in the 9th.

14:08.708 --> 14:11.666
Besides, in two years,
I'm taking over Paris as mayor.

14:11.750 --> 14:14.708
-Your sash is beautiful, Chacha.
-You didn't have to.

14:14.791 --> 14:16.416
Yes, I did have to.

14:16.500 --> 14:19.208
It's like a second skin. And, on my land.

14:19.291 --> 14:22.000
-You're only the 9th district mayor.
-That's okay.

14:24.750 --> 14:25.625
What did I miss?

14:25.708 --> 14:29.625
Not much. Elsa is taking 1,000 years
to explain how Joao Miguel came to be.

14:30.208 --> 14:33.083
Joao Miguel is so cute.

14:33.166 --> 14:34.083
That's right.

14:34.666 --> 14:36.625
He'd have been cuter with my DNA.

14:36.708 --> 14:37.666
No, not at all.

14:37.750 --> 14:39.000
-Yes.
-No.

14:39.083 --> 14:41.500
Wait, I just realized.

14:41.583 --> 14:43.958
Joao Miguel in French is

14:44.041 --> 14:45.291
Jean-Michel.

14:45.375 --> 14:46.791
Yeah, shit.

14:47.541 --> 14:51.375
Is it like for boats? Is it bad luck
if the new owner changes the name?

14:51.458 --> 14:52.666
-But--
-But--

14:53.166 --> 14:54.958
-There you go!
-What?

14:55.041 --> 14:58.208
She's been beating around the bush
to tell him he's adopted,

14:58.291 --> 15:00.041
and you spill the beans.

15:00.125 --> 15:01.583
Sorry, I didn't know.

15:02.875 --> 15:04.125
He looks happy.

15:04.208 --> 15:06.333
No, it's no big deal.

15:06.416 --> 15:09.541
It's better like this,
to say it simply, and

15:10.125 --> 15:11.291
so it makes sense.

15:11.958 --> 15:13.250
Because for me,

15:14.541 --> 15:15.791
it makes sense.

15:15.875 --> 15:16.916
Just like us.

15:18.333 --> 15:19.291
Oh, girls.

15:21.666 --> 15:23.791
-Here. Are you ready?
-Yeah.

15:23.875 --> 15:25.750
Even if we're a little old for this.

15:25.833 --> 15:28.208
-Who cares?
-You're never too old for a memory box.

15:29.541 --> 15:32.541
<i>Is the box big enough?</i>
<i>Because we've been through a lot.</i>

15:32.625 --> 15:35.041
<i>A few years ago,</i>
<i>we weren't in the same place.</i>

15:35.541 --> 15:36.833
<i>For sure, I wasn't.</i>

15:36.916 --> 15:40.083
BEST MUSIC ELSA

15:42.750 --> 15:44.166
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

16:18.791 --> 16:20.041
My first Pinkars!

16:43.833 --> 16:46.625
I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO MAKE
A BABY WITH YOU DURING LOCKDOWN

16:58.625 --> 16:59.458
Shit.

17:00.083 --> 17:01.625
Don't worry. Give me that.

17:01.708 --> 17:04.916
-There. You see?
-Sure you want to do this?

17:05.916 --> 17:07.125
You don't have to.

17:08.541 --> 17:09.708
Yes.

17:09.791 --> 17:11.166
My cancer isn't that small.

17:11.250 --> 17:14.083
I'm going through chemo.
I don't recognize my body.

17:14.750 --> 17:16.291
This is the roughest I've had it.

17:18.583 --> 17:20.000
But my cancer is like me.

17:20.666 --> 17:22.000
It's full of flaws,

17:23.000 --> 17:25.125
and yet, I'm here thanks to it.

17:25.791 --> 17:26.666
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

17:26.750 --> 17:28.958
Even though I'd rather have avoided it.

17:29.958 --> 17:31.833
-But we keep moving forward.
-Yes.

17:31.916 --> 17:34.166
The faster I go,
it won't be able to catch up.

17:34.958 --> 17:36.916
So now let me through, bitches.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.375
-Okay.
-Make room.

17:39.458 --> 17:40.791
-No freaking out.
-Yeah.

17:40.875 --> 17:42.125
No freaking out.

17:42.208 --> 17:43.125
-Okay.
-Yes!

17:43.208 --> 17:44.541
-Yes.
-Go for it.

17:50.416 --> 17:51.708
Hello, everyone.

17:53.250 --> 17:55.291
Thank you for being here. Truly.

18:03.833 --> 18:06.500
I think we all need
a little help to live together.

18:07.250 --> 18:10.458
<i>To help each other,</i>
<i>form connections, share our knowledge.</i>

18:10.541 --> 18:11.416
FEMINIST

18:11.500 --> 18:14.208
<i>We have it in us</i>
<i>if we listen to ourselves.</i>

18:14.291 --> 18:15.250
<i>And most of all…</i>

18:18.208 --> 18:19.500
<i>we have a responsibility.</i>

18:20.583 --> 18:21.416
<i>Today,</i>

18:22.583 --> 18:24.750
<i>I have three months left</i>
<i>before the first vote.</i>

18:25.583 --> 18:27.541
<i>Three months to convince you</i>

18:29.125 --> 18:30.416
<i>that my strength…</i>

18:33.375 --> 18:34.208
My strength

18:35.500 --> 18:36.541
belongs to you.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.625
-I have to wake him up.
-No.

19:41.708 --> 19:44.125
Sorry, I'm just
making sure he's breathing.

19:45.291 --> 19:46.625
He's so cute.

19:47.125 --> 19:49.791
-You think he's cold?
-Everything's all right, my love.

19:49.875 --> 19:52.500
-Look, he's sleeping.
-But it isn't the same climate--

19:52.583 --> 19:53.583
Surprise!

20:01.125 --> 20:03.708
They have a baby. She's got a baby!

20:06.416 --> 20:09.083
Shit. Did I miss the kid's arrival?

20:09.166 --> 20:10.375
-No, look.
-Great.

20:11.125 --> 20:14.125
Group selfie?
To celebrate Joao joining the gang?

20:14.208 --> 20:15.791
I got a selfie stick.

20:15.875 --> 20:18.708
Who still has a selfie stick?
Aside from your mom, Max.

20:18.791 --> 20:20.625
Whatever, everyone has one.

20:20.708 --> 20:21.708
It's so corny.

20:21.791 --> 20:23.458
You can't see us.

20:23.541 --> 20:26.750
No big deal if we can't see Milou,
but without me, it's a waste.

20:26.833 --> 20:29.333
-Let's all be cheesy again.
-All right.

20:29.416 --> 20:30.375
<i>It's not corny!</i>

20:30.458 --> 20:31.875
<i>A selfie stick is corny.</i>

20:31.958 --> 20:34.125
<i>Corny!</i>
