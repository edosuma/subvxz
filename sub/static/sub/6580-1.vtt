10:13.132 --> 10:15.800
She's gonna get better, isn't she?

10:15.825 --> 10:16.911
She's gonna be okay?

10:16.936 --> 10:18.402
I can't promise anything.

10:18.404 --> 10:20.521
[cries]

10:20.703 --> 10:24.120
No, I can't believe this.

10:24.328 --> 10:26.626
What about the baby?

10:26.913 --> 10:28.746
It's too soon to deliver, isn't it?

10:28.748 --> 10:30.281
She's only 24 weeks.

10:30.283 --> 10:31.949
Yes, the baby needs more time.

10:31.951 --> 10:33.611
What does that mean?

10:33.749 --> 10:35.939
Are we gonna lose our child, too?

10:35.964 --> 10:37.613
- Oh, my God.
- No, Mrs. Donahue.

10:37.638 --> 10:41.514
I'm not saying that, and
I'm not giving up on Gina,

10:41.539 --> 10:43.832
but if the worst did happen,

10:43.857 --> 10:46.707
it might be possible to
keep her on life support

10:46.732 --> 10:49.907
long enough for the fetus to become viable.

10:50.056 --> 10:54.407
So... so what, Gina just becomes...

10:54.858 --> 10:57.292
a human incubator?

10:57.317 --> 10:59.684
We're not there yet.

11:17.044 --> 11:19.739
Dr. Rhodes, I thought you could use these.

11:19.764 --> 11:21.649
Thank you.

11:21.958 --> 11:23.332
How'd that happen?

11:23.357 --> 11:25.757
Must have snagged it on the wreckage.

11:26.443 --> 11:29.106
You know, we do have a
couple of doctors around here.

11:29.108 --> 11:30.340
I could hook you up.

11:30.365 --> 11:33.010
I don't need one, but I
could use a nurse though.

11:33.042 --> 11:35.533
Come be my other hand.

11:35.558 --> 11:37.391
Oh, nice.

11:37.542 --> 11:39.567
You closed that like a plastic surgeon.

11:39.592 --> 11:40.825
Where'd you pick that up?

11:40.850 --> 11:42.192
Riyadh.

11:42.377 --> 11:45.078
Spent a year there after my residency.

11:45.181 --> 11:48.492
Saudis paid me well not
to leave unsightly scars.

11:48.827 --> 11:51.365
Could you pinch those two sides together?

11:51.471 --> 11:52.903
- There we go.
- What about a tetanus shot?

11:52.928 --> 11:56.897
No, I am current, April, uh...

11:56.899 --> 11:59.070
April Sexton.

11:59.245 --> 12:00.377
English? Irish?

12:00.402 --> 12:02.302
My family's from Brazil.

12:02.304 --> 12:04.536
Our real last name is Sanguessuga,

12:04.561 --> 12:07.927
but my parents thought
Sexton sounded more American,

12:07.952 --> 12:10.109
and people could actually pronounce it.

12:10.112 --> 12:11.380
Where're you from?

12:11.405 --> 12:12.780
Chicago.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.768
Born and bred.

12:15.060 --> 12:16.560
Been away for a while.

12:16.585 --> 12:18.284
Welcome home.

12:22.212 --> 12:24.646
Two and four. Three is headed to the OR.

12:24.671 --> 12:25.585
All righty.

12:25.610 --> 12:27.297
Who's young Rambo over there?

12:27.321 --> 12:28.687
Hmm?

12:30.408 --> 12:32.929
Oh, that's Connor Rhodes,
the new trauma fellow.

12:32.954 --> 12:33.780
Mm-hmm.

12:33.805 --> 12:36.534
He's gonna light up some
estrogen receptors around here.

12:36.559 --> 12:38.130
I'll say. He lit mine.

12:38.155 --> 12:39.454
Well, that's all I need.

12:39.479 --> 12:42.412
- Where's Jamie again?
- Treatment 5.

12:45.020 --> 12:47.405
[murmurs] a dream.

12:48.803 --> 12:50.255
Your daughter's stable.

12:50.280 --> 12:51.903
She has a pretty serious leg fracture,

12:51.928 --> 12:54.182
but she's okay, just a little shaken up.

12:54.184 --> 12:56.651
The orthopedic resident is on
his way to put a cast on her.

12:56.653 --> 12:58.487
And what about my husband?
I can't get any information...

12:58.489 --> 12:59.688
We made some calls.

12:59.690 --> 13:01.456
Your husband's down the road at Sinai.

13:01.458 --> 13:04.373
They were able to stabilize him,
but his injuries are serious.

13:04.398 --> 13:06.498
The last word I had, he
was headed into surgery.

13:06.530 --> 13:08.397
How is this happening?

13:08.399 --> 13:10.132
They were just going on a
father-daughter day trip.

13:10.134 --> 13:11.500
She wanted to go to the zoo. What...

13:11.502 --> 13:14.372
Ms. Lewis, the best
thing you can do right now

13:14.397 --> 13:15.974
is just be there for your daughter.

13:15.999 --> 13:18.199
We'll keep checking on your husband, okay?

13:18.436 --> 13:20.402
All right.

13:20.427 --> 13:23.028
[machines beep]

13:23.257 --> 13:26.239
There. You can see her feet and a hand.

13:26.264 --> 13:27.880
Everything looks good,
Mr. and Mrs. Donahue.

13:27.905 --> 13:31.273
Oh, thank you for doing this.
We just needed to see her again.

13:35.613 --> 13:38.762
She... she just squeezed my hand.

13:38.787 --> 13:40.468
I swear, I felt it.

13:40.493 --> 13:41.897
Her reflexes are still intact.

13:41.922 --> 13:44.297
Movement can occur,
but it's not purposeful.

13:46.030 --> 13:48.512
No, she... she just did it again,

13:48.537 --> 13:49.793
right when you wiped her stomach.

13:49.818 --> 13:51.498
She responded.

13:58.293 --> 14:00.271
Tell me that wasn't purposeful.

14:00.296 --> 14:03.508
Dr. Troy, let's get a repeat CAT scan.

14:04.671 --> 14:07.474
You haven't seen... even one?

14:07.499 --> 14:10.300
Hand to God, J, I swear I keep meaning to.

14:10.325 --> 14:12.458
I just...

14:14.182 --> 14:16.551
You need another blanket here, buddy.

14:18.032 --> 14:21.285
How many "Fast and Furious"
movies are there anyway?

14:21.310 --> 14:22.435
I mean, seriously.

14:22.437 --> 14:23.602
Seven.

14:23.604 --> 14:25.210
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:25.483 --> 14:27.216
I got a lot of catching up to do.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.475
- Well, the last one's the best.
- How about this?

14:29.477 --> 14:32.447
I'm gonna start with the
last and move back... deal?

14:32.472 --> 14:34.242
- [knock at door]
- Okay.

14:34.282 --> 14:37.116
Dr. Rhodes, dressed.

14:37.118 --> 14:39.157
I'm Dr. Charles, Head of Psychiatry.

14:39.182 --> 14:40.463
Welcome to Chicago Med.

14:40.488 --> 14:42.446
Pleasure. Thank you.

14:43.322 --> 14:45.126
You two know each other?

14:45.151 --> 14:47.184
Old pals.

14:47.186 --> 14:49.916
Known Jamie since he was... eight?

14:49.941 --> 14:52.565
He taught me... how to play chess.

14:52.590 --> 14:54.417
Big mistake. Beats me every time.

14:54.442 --> 14:55.121
Not kidding.

14:55.146 --> 14:57.121
[all chuckle]

14:57.528 --> 15:01.020
Jamie, I've got your test results back.

15:01.519 --> 15:04.320
I wish they were a little more encouraging.

15:04.345 --> 15:07.896
You're pancytopenic, which means
that your cell counts are low.

15:07.921 --> 15:11.199
You've got a blood pH of
7.14, which means that you...

15:11.224 --> 15:13.524
I know.

15:13.845 --> 15:16.846
I'd like to intubate you, put you to sleep,

15:16.871 --> 15:18.237
get you on a ventilator.

15:18.239 --> 15:19.639
You're getting fatigued.

15:19.641 --> 15:20.907
This would just allow you to rest

15:20.909 --> 15:22.808
so that the antibiotics can do their job.

15:22.810 --> 15:26.571
I've been intubated eight times.

15:26.596 --> 15:28.796
I think I'll skip it.

15:30.157 --> 15:33.355
All right. I'll check back in later, huh?

15:41.595 --> 15:43.822
Hey.

15:46.236 --> 15:48.297
Well, there's something
I don't often see...

15:48.322 --> 15:50.175
Will Halstead looking stumped.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.933
Why is it brain injuries are never

15:51.958 --> 15:53.767

15:53.792 --> 15:57.428
My pregnant TBI patient,
bilateral contusions.

15:57.453 --> 16:00.234
She was a GCS 3. And now, all of a sudden,

16:00.259 --> 16:02.594
she's exhibiting movement,
and she's improved to a 6.

16:02.619 --> 16:04.871
- Well, that's good news.
- Yeah.

16:04.896 --> 16:07.079
The baby's parents will be happy.

16:07.683 --> 16:10.228
Oh, she's a... she's a surrogate.

16:10.389 --> 16:12.971
Oh. Wow.

16:12.996 --> 16:14.996
I don't know how they do that.

16:15.214 --> 16:17.251
Carry a baby and then give it up?

16:17.276 --> 16:18.876
I mean, I know it brings a lot of joy

16:18.901 --> 16:20.918
to other people, but still...

16:22.442 --> 16:23.875
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

16:25.172 --> 16:26.805
You meet the new guy yet, Rhodes?

Hey, I am not arrogant.

16:36.453 --> 16:38.864
No, no. Not at all.

16:38.889 --> 16:41.389
You just happen to know
more than anybody else.

16:46.073 --> 16:49.508
Dr. Rhodes, this is Ms. Acosta.

This is my colleague, Dr. Manning.

19:03.326 --> 19:04.892
Hi.

19:04.917 --> 19:07.753
We, uh, we read to the baby every night

19:07.778 --> 19:09.830
so she'll recognize our voices.

19:09.855 --> 19:11.930
I do that, too.

- Sherry?
- Dr. Halstead?

Need to blow down her CO2,

19:21.911 --> 19:23.198
take her off the vent and bag her,

19:23.223 --> 19:24.611
give her a dose of Mannitol,

19:24.636 --> 19:26.201

Gina's intracranial pressure is rising.

What does that mean?

19:31.932 --> 19:33.599
You said that she was getting better.

19:33.601 --> 19:36.602
Well, she is, in that her
function was improving,

19:36.604 --> 19:39.402
but the swelling of her
brain is getting worse.

19:39.427 --> 19:41.766
We're gonna try to
control it with medication.

19:41.791 --> 19:44.225
And what if the medication doesn't work?

19:44.227 --> 19:46.443
Then she'll require surgery.

19:46.468 --> 19:49.207
The procedure's called a
"decompressive craniectomy."

19:49.232 --> 19:52.143
Would that be dangerous to the baby?

19:52.307 --> 19:54.963
There is always a risk for the fetus,

19:54.988 --> 19:57.415
and for the mother as well, so, yes.

19:57.440 --> 20:00.342

He doesn't want that.

20:25.935 --> 20:26.880
No, you know what, Doctor?

We're actually not past what Jamie wants.

20:38.327 --> 20:40.648
What's that gonna give
him? A week? Ten days?

20:40.673 --> 20:43.807
It could be six months, a year, more,

20:43.832 --> 20:45.665

20:45.690 --> 20:48.524
New treatments are coming along every day.

Now, is he on the list?

20:50.074 --> 20:52.520
Right at the top, but a
match is highly unlikely.

20:52.545 --> 20:55.106
He has HLA antibodies from
an islet cell transplant.

20:55.131 --> 20:56.741
Well, have you spoken to his next of kin?

20:56.766 --> 20:58.032

21:05.008 --> 21:06.707
you know what's gonna happen.

21:06.709 --> 21:08.652
Jamie will lose consciousness,

21:08.677 --> 21:10.968

put him on a ventilator,

but by then it may be too late,

21:13.778 --> 21:16.128
and there won't be any more choices

21:16.153 --> 21:18.553
no matter what anybody wants.

21:31.645 --> 21:33.044
I'm Sarah Reese.

21:33.069 --> 21:34.429
I'm a fourth year medical student.

21:34.454 --> 21:36.933
Um, Dr. Manning sent
me in to check on Rachel

21:36.958 --> 21:38.482
before we sign her out.

21:41.922 --> 21:43.555
This is for you.

21:43.580 --> 21:47.782
Oh, thanks. What's his name?

21:48.551 --> 21:50.942
Why don't you give him a name?

21:52.201 --> 21:55.669
I need to... talk to your mom.

21:56.879 --> 21:59.647
- So, about your husband...
- What?

21:59.672 --> 22:02.272
No, no. He's okay. He's still in surgery.

22:02.297 --> 22:03.863
The OR nurse says it's going well.

22:03.865 --> 22:06.150
As soon as we hear
something, I'll let you know.

22:06.881 --> 22:08.982
Rachel?

22:09.656 --> 22:11.773
Rachel, can you hear me? What is wrong?

22:11.798 --> 22:13.564
What's happening?

22:13.589 --> 22:16.349
- I can't find a pulse.
- Oh, my God.

22:18.002 --> 22:20.922
<i>Code Blue, Treatment 3.</i>

22:20.947 --> 22:23.541
<i>Code Blue, Treatment 3.</i>

22:23.566 --> 22:25.830
Code... a little help here!

22:25.855 --> 22:28.756
<i>Code Blue, Treatment 3.</i>

22:30.633 --> 22:34.211
<i>Code Blue, Treatment 3. Code Blue.</i>

22:34.898 --> 22:36.546
You're not compressing the heart, Sarah.

22:36.548 --> 22:38.391
- You gotta go harder.
- But she's so small.

22:38.416 --> 22:40.343
- I don't want to...
- Harder! Do it, let's go!

22:42.782 --> 22:45.368
Come on, Sarah! Harder!

22:46.824 --> 22:48.591
Hold!

22:49.225 --> 22:51.425
There we go. Back in sinus. Get a BP.

22:51.450 --> 22:52.789
What happened?

22:52.814 --> 22:55.348
She arrested. We got her back.

22:55.373 --> 22:56.568
I can't get an IV.

22:56.593 --> 22:58.967
Hand me a drill. I'll get an IO line.

23:00.073 --> 23:04.368
- [saw whirs]
- I got a line.

23:05.042 --> 23:07.949
All right, let's get her a
CT/PE study and up to PICU.

23:07.982 --> 23:10.473
Mom, you can come with us.

23:16.550 --> 23:18.216
Good job.

23:18.633 --> 23:20.032
I-I just...

23:20.057 --> 23:22.498
I just broke a little girl's ribs.

23:23.598 --> 23:26.286
Reese, you saved the girl's life.

23:37.016 --> 23:39.716
- Jamie.
- Huh?

23:39.741 --> 23:43.901
You know more about CF than most doctors.

23:43.926 --> 23:45.525
I'm an expert.

23:45.550 --> 23:47.338
So you know what will happen

23:47.363 --> 23:49.015
if we don't put you on a ventilator.

23:49.039 --> 23:51.306
[coughs]

23:51.331 --> 23:57.214
Dr. Charles... it's okay.

23:57.239 --> 23:59.923
[wheezy inhale] I've had a good life.

23:59.948 --> 24:03.370
Whoa, whoa, whoa! [laughs]

24:03.395 --> 24:05.795
What movie is that from?

24:05.820 --> 24:06.828
[Jamie coughs]

24:06.853 --> 24:10.446
No, no, no. Jamie, look at me.

24:10.589 --> 24:14.305
It's me, your corner man.

24:16.357 --> 24:19.145
You got a lot of fight left in you.

24:19.340 --> 24:22.008
I'm not ready to throw in the towel.

24:22.237 --> 24:24.070
One more round.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.681
For you?

24:28.706 --> 24:33.034
Yeah. For me.

24:34.660 --> 24:38.440
Yeah, okay. Okay.

24:45.857 --> 24:47.672
Mariana?

24:48.006 --> 24:51.274
Hi. I'm Maggie.

24:51.518 --> 24:55.420
This... this is Jorge's.

24:55.445 --> 24:57.764
- <i>Entiendes?</i>
- Yes.

24:58.030 --> 25:03.273
Inside... I found this.

25:08.087 --> 25:12.890
"From J.M. to M.A."

25:18.411 --> 25:21.020
You're not his girlfriend.

25:23.199 --> 25:25.514
You're his fiancée.

25:25.743 --> 25:31.948
- Prometida.
- Prometida.

25:46.077 --> 25:48.490
Jorge.

25:59.838 --> 26:01.855
[elevator bell rings]

26:03.454 --> 26:07.222
Natalie, what happened
with the little girl?

26:07.247 --> 26:09.292
She had a cardiac contusion.

26:09.317 --> 26:10.650
Bruising caused her to arrest.

26:10.675 --> 26:13.224
She's good now, but it was a real scare.

26:13.249 --> 26:14.615
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

26:22.792 --> 26:24.725
Your comatose guy...

26:24.994 --> 26:27.695
seems like you'd want to put
him on the hypothermic protocol

26:27.720 --> 26:28.886
and protect his brain.

26:28.888 --> 26:31.573
Well, I just gave him 20 units of blood.

26:31.598 --> 26:33.768
His pH is only 7.2,

26:33.793 --> 26:35.826
and he's too cold to make a clot,

26:35.828 --> 26:38.729
so I didn't see how
the hypothermic protocol

26:38.731 --> 26:40.597
would help him.

26:40.829 --> 26:42.922
Hey, you're the fellow.
I'm just a resident.

26:42.947 --> 26:45.541
Heard you're local. Me, too.

26:45.566 --> 26:47.532
Where'd you grow up?

26:47.557 --> 26:48.856
Lake Shore Drive.

26:48.881 --> 26:51.949
[whistles] Nice.

26:51.974 --> 26:54.973
Well, I doubt we have
any friends in common.

26:55.780 --> 26:58.820
Canaryville. Oh.

26:58.845 --> 27:01.990
Where'd you go to med school?
Johns Hopkins? Stanford?

27:02.015 --> 27:03.748
No. I went to UAG.

27:03.773 --> 27:06.165
- Where's that?
- Guadalajara.

27:06.190 --> 27:08.770
Didn't see that coming. [phone beeps]

27:10.377 --> 27:12.634
Got to go.

27:22.684 --> 27:24.449
Her ICP is unresponsive?

27:24.474 --> 27:26.225
Her CPP is 40.

27:26.250 --> 27:28.216
Sherry, get me Dr. Abrams.

27:28.241 --> 27:30.441
You... you're planning to do the surgery?

27:30.466 --> 27:31.565
What about our baby?

27:31.590 --> 27:32.723
The meds we've been giving Gina

27:32.748 --> 27:33.950
haven't been effective.

27:33.975 --> 27:36.121
Her intracranial pressure,
the brain swelling,

27:36.146 --> 27:37.496
is getting to a dangerous level,

27:37.521 --> 27:38.520
and we shouldn't wait any longer.

27:38.522 --> 27:40.255
I'm not sure we can consent to that.

27:40.257 --> 27:41.873
It's not really a matter of consent.

27:41.898 --> 27:43.997
Well, actually, Doctor, it is.

27:44.022 --> 27:46.188
We have a surrogacy contract with Gina.

27:46.296 --> 27:49.031
A rider to that is a
Medical Power of Attorney,

27:49.033 --> 27:50.394
giving us the right to make decisions

27:50.419 --> 27:51.458
on Gina's behalf.

27:51.483 --> 27:53.250
I don't see how we can
sign off on a procedure

27:53.275 --> 27:54.927
knowing it will endanger our child.

27:54.952 --> 27:57.686
Mr. and Mrs. Donahue,
Gina needs this surgery.

27:57.711 --> 27:59.080
It's her only hope.

27:59.105 --> 28:01.372
But it's not a guarantee
she's gonna recover.

28:01.397 --> 28:04.598
No, but without the surgery,
I can guarantee she won't.

28:09.074 --> 28:11.274
You would just allow
her condition to worsen?

28:11.299 --> 28:12.843
This is our child!

28:12.868 --> 28:15.769
What would you do to save your child?

28:16.627 --> 28:21.897
<i>Code Blue, ICU. Code Blue, ICU.</i>

28:21.899 --> 28:23.398
<i>Code Blue, ICU.</i>

28:23.400 --> 28:24.499
Jorge! [cries]

28:24.501 --> 28:26.880
I'll take over!

28:26.905 --> 28:28.764
Ma'am, I'm sorry, we need some more room.

28:28.789 --> 28:31.231
- [sobbing]
- Hold compressions.

28:36.232 --> 28:38.091
- No pulse.
- Sinus tach.

28:38.115 --> 28:39.268
He's profoundly hypotensive.

28:39.293 --> 28:41.837
Amp of Epi, max of Dopamine, max of Vaso.

28:41.862 --> 28:43.729
You're gonna max him on pressors.

28:43.754 --> 28:47.280
Don't have a choice. Pads.

28:58.024 --> 28:59.492
That contract's obscene.

28:59.494 --> 29:01.346
I mean, the Donahues control everything,

29:01.371 --> 29:03.118
what Gina can eat, drink,
how much she sleeps,

29:03.143 --> 29:04.095
even what she wears.

29:04.120 --> 29:05.753
We have to perform this operation.

29:05.755 --> 29:06.908
Well, I'd advise against that

29:06.933 --> 29:08.618
because this is really comprehensive,

29:08.643 --> 29:10.524
and nicely drawn up, I might add.

29:10.526 --> 29:12.315
The lady probably didn't even
know what she was signing.

29:12.340 --> 29:14.067
We can't prove that.

29:14.092 --> 29:15.925
We can't just stand by and let her die.

29:15.950 --> 29:18.083
I guarantee if we perform this operation,

29:18.108 --> 29:19.253
regardless of the outcome,

29:19.278 --> 29:21.011
we'll be sued, and they'll likely win,

29:21.036 --> 29:22.265
and millions.

29:22.290 --> 29:23.922
And that's how we make our decisions?

29:23.924 --> 29:25.224
By how much it's gonna cost us?

29:25.226 --> 29:27.906
All right, get off the
high horse, Dr. Halstead.

29:28.064 --> 29:30.098
How about we call the Ethics Committee?

29:30.475 --> 29:31.974
Be faster to call a judge,

29:31.999 --> 29:33.706
but I'm not gonna burn a favor on this.

29:33.731 --> 29:35.097
This is ridiculous!

29:35.122 --> 29:36.912
Why aren't you trying to help us?

29:36.937 --> 29:39.858
He is, and you need to back off!

29:44.213 --> 29:47.104
So much easier to run a
hospital without doctors.

29:47.129 --> 29:48.996
Please.

29:51.912 --> 29:56.393
Jorge's brain was without
oxygen for too long.

30:34.286 --> 30:36.536
Mariana.

30:36.567 --> 30:40.435
Mariana, this is Ms. Goodwin,
our hospital administrator,

30:40.460 --> 30:42.794
and Yolanda Cruz from Gift of Hope.

30:42.961 --> 30:45.222
They would like to speak to you.

30:45.797 --> 30:48.730
Thank you, Dr. Rhodes.

30:49.935 --> 30:55.572
<i>Senorita Acosta,</i> [speaking Spanish]

Let's get Mr. Melendez typed

31:00.236 --> 31:01.702
Keep him on the ventilator.

31:01.713 --> 31:03.237
Okay.

31:09.387 --> 31:11.712
Your first day, you already
found my hiding spot.

I'm Nat.

31:16.263 --> 31:17.670
I don't suppose you keep a bottle

31:17.695 --> 31:19.373

31:19.398 --> 31:21.787
Not in my condition.

31:21.812 --> 31:24.179
I heard about your patient.

31:24.204 --> 31:26.725
- Tough one.
- Yeah.

I just keep wondering...

31:29.211 --> 31:31.466
If there was anything
else you could've done?

31:31.491 --> 31:33.266
I know.

31:37.185 --> 31:39.441
Is your husband a doc, too?

31:42.736 --> 31:46.667
- No.

Hi. I have some good news.

32:03.900 --> 32:06.181
Somebody would like to say hello to you.

32:06.206 --> 32:09.088
Oh, God. David!

32:09.113 --> 32:11.090
Judy.

32:11.115 --> 32:14.127
I'm fine. How's Rachel?

32:14.152 --> 32:17.220
She's good. She's sleeping.

32:17.245 --> 32:19.178
The doctors said her tests are good.

32:19.203 --> 32:21.369
They just want to keep
her here a day or two.

32:21.394 --> 32:23.666
David, I didn't know where you were.

32:23.691 --> 32:27.566
I don't know what I would do if I lost you.

32:35.794 --> 32:37.516
Ms. Donahue,

32:37.541 --> 32:40.669
I'm Sharon Goodwin, Chief of Services.

32:40.694 --> 32:42.822
I know about your situation.

32:42.847 --> 32:44.869
And you think we're monsters.

32:44.894 --> 32:47.025
No, no.

32:47.050 --> 32:49.549
I think that you and your husband

32:49.574 --> 32:53.510
are faced with a very difficult decision.

32:54.953 --> 32:58.055
We just wanted to have a baby.

32:58.080 --> 33:00.013
That's all.

33:00.414 --> 33:03.886
It's supposed to be so simple,
so natural, and instead...

33:04.675 --> 33:06.596
I understand.

33:08.806 --> 33:11.006
We love Gina,

33:11.031 --> 33:15.273
but this is our last
chance to have a child.

33:15.298 --> 33:18.551
There's no more embryos, no more eggs.

33:24.104 --> 33:26.804
What are we supposed to do?

33:26.829 --> 33:30.019
You have to ask yourself
what you can live with.

33:30.248 --> 33:33.029
How are you gonna feel a week from now?

33:33.054 --> 33:36.628
A month or a few years?

33:37.355 --> 33:40.829
Gina handed over her life
to you in that contract.

33:40.854 --> 33:44.700
She trusted you to make the right decision.

33:48.613 --> 33:51.347
What would you do if you were me?

33:51.676 --> 33:54.969
I'd want to live up to that trust.

Removing cranial flap now.

34:10.085 --> 34:11.570

34:11.594 --> 34:14.204
If we waited any longer,
she would have herniated.

34:18.292 --> 34:20.833
- Give me suction here.
- Yes, Doctor.

34:28.312 --> 34:29.985
All right, as soon as I cauterize this,

34:30.024 --> 34:31.422
we can get into the Dura.

- Give me suction here.

35:04.251 --> 35:06.084
Dr. Charles?

35:07.840 --> 35:10.662
A crash victim I'd been treating has died.

35:10.687 --> 35:12.704
He's a match for Jamie.

35:19.933 --> 35:21.947
Let's get him some lungs.

35:21.972 --> 35:25.724
Only thing, his fiancée
won't give consent.

35:27.357 --> 35:29.923
Where is she?

35:47.518 --> 35:49.741
[clears throat]

35:49.766 --> 35:53.015
It was a difficult
surgery, but it went well.

35:53.040 --> 35:57.013
Dr. Abrams was able to relieve
the pressure on Gina's brain.

35:57.038 --> 36:01.907
Both Gina and the baby came
through just fine, so far.

36:03.636 --> 36:07.538
Dr. Abrams will be out
to speak to you shortly.

36:07.563 --> 36:09.914
Thank you.

36:11.328 --> 36:14.553
[both laugh]

36:19.216 --> 36:21.049
He's 20 years old.

36:21.074 --> 36:24.575
Without new lungs, he will die.

36:24.600 --> 36:29.580

36:30.450 --> 36:33.217
- Your fiancé...

36:39.043 --> 36:41.895

36:41.920 --> 36:45.199
- Can save his life.

37:04.489 --> 37:06.597
Wait.

37:11.086 --> 37:14.954
Si. [speaks Spanish]

37:14.979 --> 37:16.779
Yes.

37:16.781 --> 37:18.681
Thank you.

37:18.706 --> 37:22.067
I'll alert the transplant team.

37:32.197 --> 37:34.331
Central line.

37:34.482 --> 37:37.082
I can't tell you how many times I missed

37:37.107 --> 37:38.740
before I finally got it.

37:38.758 --> 37:41.325
I know how to do it. I just
couldn't do it in there.

37:41.350 --> 37:43.740
It takes practice, that's all.

37:43.765 --> 37:46.430
I'm fine with him. I never miss.

37:46.455 --> 37:48.789
Yeah, he's the ideal patient.

37:48.948 --> 37:50.347
You can't hurt him,

37:50.372 --> 37:52.924
and his life's not hanging in the balance.

37:53.072 --> 37:54.572
If this rotation weren't a requirement,

37:54.597 --> 37:56.296
I wouldn't be here.

37:56.298 --> 37:57.531
Where would you be?

37:57.556 --> 37:58.824
I'm a lab person.

37:58.849 --> 38:01.023
- Pathology?
- Maybe.

38:02.511 --> 38:04.611
Every med student,

38:04.856 --> 38:07.004
once they start dealing with patients,

38:07.029 --> 38:09.943
thinks they'd do better in Pathology.

38:10.226 --> 38:12.475
I did.

Third wife was from Spain. Loved Lorca.

Came in handy when we were courting.

They got the first lung in.

Jamie made that for me when he was eight.

I mean, this kid did more things
than most kids his age ever do.

40:20.328 --> 40:22.328
He went out for the
swim team in high school.

40:22.353 --> 40:25.989
A kid with CF taught me how to cope.
