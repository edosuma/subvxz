WEBVTT

00:05.739 --> 00:07.341
Zoe, eat up.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.581
You're gonna be
late for work.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.116
I can't find my shoes.

00:15.149 --> 00:16.817
Well, where did
you last see them?

00:16.850 --> 00:18.352
On my feet, Maddy.

00:22.756 --> 00:24.258
Hey, Dad.
Yep.

00:24.292 --> 00:25.902
Have you seen my shoes?
Are you kidding me?

00:25.926 --> 00:26.894
Zoe, where's
your jacket?

00:26.927 --> 00:27.995
Come on, we got
to be there

00:28.028 --> 00:29.029
in five minutes.

00:29.063 --> 00:30.164
Where are we going, Daddy?

00:30.198 --> 00:31.765
Well, I told
you, it's a surprise.

00:31.799 --> 00:34.402
Mommy. Don't look at me,
he hasn't told me anything.

00:34.435 --> 00:35.979
Well, that's 'cause no one in
this family can keep a secret.

00:36.003 --> 00:38.606
- Go on, get your jacket.
- Okay, I'm off to surgery

00:38.639 --> 00:40.808
and then I'll be home
for dinner. Okay, bye.

00:40.841 --> 00:42.876
See you, bye.

00:42.910 --> 00:44.011
Found your shoes.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.679
Why are you being
so helpful?

00:46.480 --> 00:48.082
Why do you look
kind of nice?

00:48.116 --> 00:49.049
Why do you smell good?

00:49.083 --> 00:51.119
Go.

00:51.152 --> 00:52.262
What are
your plans for today?

00:52.286 --> 00:53.754
Um, just homework.

00:53.787 --> 00:54.922
It's Saturday.

00:54.955 --> 00:57.158
Yeah, I've, I've got, like,
tons of catching up to do.

00:57.191 --> 00:58.092
- Daddy, let's go.
- Bye.

00:58.126 --> 01:00.494
Bye.
See you.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.674
Hey.
How'd it go?

01:13.707 --> 01:15.276
Didn't suspect
a thing.

01:15.309 --> 01:17.445
Shall we?
Yeah.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.182
Yeah, I'm afraid
Mira's mystery object

01:21.215 --> 01:23.351
remains just that.

01:23.384 --> 01:25.153
The only thing
I can tell you for certain

01:25.186 --> 01:26.626
is that it was designed
to be opened.

01:26.654 --> 01:29.223
Yes, there doesn't appear
to be any seams

01:29.257 --> 01:32.793
or buttons or levers
of any kind, but...

01:32.826 --> 01:35.629
take a look at this.

01:38.899 --> 01:39.967
What am I looking at?

01:40.000 --> 01:40.968
Enlighten me.

01:41.001 --> 01:44.238
It's some sort
of DNA response system.

01:44.272 --> 01:46.174
Basically,
this object was designed

01:46.207 --> 01:48.742
so that it can
only be opened

01:48.776 --> 01:49.777
by one person.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.745
Mira.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.714
Most likely.

01:55.249 --> 01:57.551
Lock it away,
will you?

02:01.822 --> 02:02.822
Hey.

02:04.225 --> 02:06.059
Whoa, what's with him?

02:06.093 --> 02:08.229
Uh, he drank some
unfermented Taroca root

02:08.262 --> 02:10.698
and it's not sitting too well.

02:10.731 --> 02:13.076
Thought you said you were gonna
take it easy last night. Yeah, he did,

02:13.100 --> 02:15.236
this is from
last week.

02:15.269 --> 02:16.237
And you're
still hungover?

02:16.270 --> 02:17.405
Please stop shouting.

02:17.438 --> 02:19.873
Oh, well, feel better
soon, man, and, uh,

02:19.907 --> 02:22.152
if you're up to it, swing by
Boylan's tonight for a drink.

02:22.176 --> 02:23.211
Okay?

02:26.480 --> 02:28.258
Please tell me why we became
friends with the Devil.

02:28.282 --> 02:31.352
Hmm, come on.

02:31.385 --> 02:33.621
Unfermented Taroca root?

02:33.654 --> 02:36.123
Do you realize that could lead
to septicemia

02:36.156 --> 02:37.525
and possibly renal failure?

02:38.759 --> 02:41.362
Hunter, do you understand the
seriousness of what I'm saying

02:41.395 --> 02:43.297
and the stupidity
of what you've done?

02:43.331 --> 02:45.533
Yes, ma'am.
All right.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.201
Come on, let's scan you,
lie down.

02:49.570 --> 02:52.473
Lie flat, okay,
and try and keep still.

03:03.183 --> 03:06.119
Huh, well, that would explain
your symptoms.

03:06.153 --> 03:08.322
Oh, what is that?

03:08.356 --> 03:09.790
What, what
is what?

03:09.823 --> 03:11.625
Yikes, is that a Taroca?

03:11.659 --> 03:12.726
What's a Taroca?

03:12.760 --> 03:14.161
30-footer.

03:14.194 --> 03:14.862
30 what-er?

03:14.895 --> 03:16.897
Prep the bed
for sonic surgery.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.766
Somebody please tell me
what's going on here.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.559
Yeah, you have a parasite
growing inside you.

03:21.369 --> 03:23.136
Say hello to your new friend.

03:29.843 --> 03:32.613
So where we're about to go
is very special.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.114
There isn't anything like it

03:34.147 --> 03:36.750
in this world
or the one we left behind.

03:36.784 --> 03:37.751
You ready?

03:37.785 --> 03:40.688
Yeah. Okay, me,
too, come on, let's go.

03:54.167 --> 03:55.703
Go ahead.

04:06.113 --> 04:07.281
Where are we?

04:07.315 --> 04:09.383
Anywhere you want to be.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.419
Some people call
this place the Eye

04:11.452 --> 04:14.455
'cause you can see
all of history from here.

04:14.488 --> 04:16.457
It's all stored
in this liquid memory core.

04:16.490 --> 04:20.628
It's kind of like
a great big library that has

04:20.661 --> 04:22.663
everything we know
in one spot.

04:22.696 --> 04:26.300
Sit down,
let me show you.

04:26.334 --> 04:28.636
Come here.

04:32.306 --> 04:34.708
Begin.

04:38.512 --> 04:41.449
So pick a place.

04:41.482 --> 04:44.485
How about where
I was born?

04:44.518 --> 04:47.220
Where you were born?

04:47.254 --> 04:49.156
You sure?
Yeah.

04:49.189 --> 04:52.159
Okay.

04:53.026 --> 04:56.330
2141, Illinois,
aerial view.

04:56.364 --> 04:58.399
Move in.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.200
Cook County,
north sector.

05:00.233 --> 05:01.234
Punch in.

05:01.268 --> 05:03.571
Stop.

05:06.039 --> 05:06.774
You see that?

05:06.807 --> 05:09.377
That house is where
you were born.

05:11.244 --> 05:13.381
Why there?

05:13.414 --> 05:16.617
Well, that's
where we had to go

05:16.650 --> 05:18.218
because we weren't allowed
to have you,

05:18.251 --> 05:21.989
but we wanted you
so much

05:22.022 --> 05:24.558
that we didn't care
what the rules were,

05:24.592 --> 05:28.362
so we went
to a doctor friend of Mommy's

05:28.396 --> 05:30.931
who lived way far away
from the city.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.536
Oh, and you see
that room there?

05:35.569 --> 05:38.972
There was a rocking chair
right by the window,

05:39.006 --> 05:43.310
and sometimes you'd wake up
in the middle of the night,

05:43.343 --> 05:45.479
and I would
hold you close

05:45.513 --> 05:48.549
and I would rock you,

05:48.582 --> 05:50.918
and you would look
out at the rain

05:50.951 --> 05:53.954
and... fall back asleep.

05:59.660 --> 06:03.697
Okay, um...
where to next?

06:05.365 --> 06:07.401
A roller coaster.

06:07.435 --> 06:09.503
A roller coaster?

06:09.537 --> 06:10.704
Who told you
about those?

06:10.738 --> 06:12.272
I read about
them once.

06:13.273 --> 06:14.241
And they look fun.

06:14.274 --> 06:16.544
Okay.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.178
Roller coasters.

06:21.148 --> 06:23.150
That one.

06:24.184 --> 06:26.119
Commence
program.

06:37.297 --> 06:39.833
Can I look now?

06:40.534 --> 06:43.303
Okay, go ahead.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.640
Dayflowers.

06:46.674 --> 06:49.577
Had a feeling you'd
know what they were.

06:49.610 --> 06:52.045
Flora diem.

06:52.079 --> 06:56.984
You know, they live out their
entire life cycle in 24 hours.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.353
Thank you.

07:02.289 --> 07:04.925
They're beautiful.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.295
You want to eat?

07:08.328 --> 07:10.063
Yeah.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.966
What is so funny about that?

07:13.000 --> 07:15.469
You wanted to be
an accountant on the moon?

07:16.770 --> 07:18.539
Well, it made sense
when I was six.

07:18.572 --> 07:19.749
Hmm, right. You
should have seen me.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.975
I had my grandfather's
rebreather on.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.811
Like one of those
giganto ones?

07:23.844 --> 07:26.580
Huge... and I had
a calculator,

07:26.614 --> 07:27.981
and I would hide under

07:28.015 --> 07:29.292
the dining room
table, pretending

07:29.316 --> 07:30.317
that I was
on the moon.

07:30.350 --> 07:31.350
Adding things?

07:32.786 --> 07:35.455
Well, when you say
it like that...

07:35.489 --> 07:36.600
No, no, no,
I didn't mean to...

07:36.624 --> 07:38.325
It was a dumb story.

07:38.358 --> 07:39.392
No, I liked it.
It's okay.

07:39.426 --> 07:40.427
No, I'm an idiot.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.129
Don't worry.
No, you're perfect.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.931
What?

07:44.698 --> 07:46.800
What did you say?

07:51.271 --> 07:53.206
I said you're perfect.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.610
But what do I know?

07:56.644 --> 07:58.512
I'm just a lunar
accountant.

08:09.523 --> 08:10.490
What's that?

08:10.524 --> 08:12.292
What's what?

08:12.325 --> 08:15.195
Over there.

08:34.582 --> 08:36.183
Meteor.

08:36.216 --> 08:39.986
It's burning up,
but it's coming in fast.

08:49.096 --> 08:52.866
Dr. Shannon, we're losing power.

08:54.702 --> 08:57.938
The chem lights are coming up.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.040
What's going on?
I'm not sure.

09:00.073 --> 09:04.077
Damn thing kicked out
some kind of EMP.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.355
Sonic wave.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.023
Sonic wave!

09:16.056 --> 09:17.290
Everybody down!

09:17.324 --> 09:18.726
Get down!

09:18.759 --> 09:19.927
Everybody down!

09:19.960 --> 09:21.028
Heads down!

09:21.561 --> 09:22.963
Take cover!

09:22.996 --> 09:24.898
Down!
Wash, get in there.

09:26.667 --> 09:29.036
Get down!

10:04.137 --> 10:07.307
If the meteor hits a planet,
well, that's not so terrible

10:07.340 --> 10:09.042
unless you happen to
be standing under it.

10:09.076 --> 10:12.913
The impact is absorbed,
end up with a big hole,

10:12.946 --> 10:16.149
but meteor explodes
in the atmosphere,

10:16.183 --> 10:17.651
that's unfortunate.

10:17.685 --> 10:20.187
Been on the receiving
end of an EMP before.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.388
Right, Wash?

10:21.421 --> 10:22.723
Somalia '37.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.892
Russo-Chinese
set one off,

10:24.925 --> 10:26.335
took out everything
within 50 klicks.

10:26.359 --> 10:29.096
Power systems,
communications, surveillance.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.733
Transport, pulse rifles...
They're all useless.

10:32.766 --> 10:33.734
What about
the perimeter mines?

10:33.767 --> 10:35.268
Negative...
They're down, too.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.303
So what now?

10:36.336 --> 10:37.814
We pull replacement circuits
out of storage

10:37.838 --> 10:38.939
and start swapping
them in?

10:38.972 --> 10:41.208
I wish it was
that easy, Reilly.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.243
See, the thing is,
it doesn't matter

10:43.276 --> 10:46.546
whether a circuit is powered
up or not when an EMP hits.

10:46.579 --> 10:48.782
Either way,
circuit gets fried.

10:48.816 --> 10:50.217
Backups are
out, too.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.519
The only thing we do have
is chemical lighting.

10:52.552 --> 10:55.622
Chem lamps and candles,
people... back to basics, huh?

10:55.655 --> 10:57.424
Sharpen
your knives.

10:57.457 --> 10:58.692
Eyes sharp, too.

10:58.726 --> 11:01.561
I want extra spotters
on every tower.

11:01.594 --> 11:02.972
With the perimeter
down, there's nothing

11:02.996 --> 11:05.465
to keep the local
wildlife away. See to it.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.867
Yes, sir.

11:19.847 --> 11:22.015
That's another broken limb.

11:22.049 --> 11:24.117
We're full up in here,
but nothing critical.

11:24.151 --> 11:26.386
Well, how long
before the power comes back?

11:26.419 --> 11:27.654
They don't know.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.757
Chem lights are working,
but nothing else.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.225
- See if you can find some ice.
- Doctor?

11:32.259 --> 11:33.259
Doctor!

11:34.361 --> 11:37.931
Okay, uh, we have no choice
but to go in

11:37.965 --> 11:39.900
and extract your parasite
the old-fashioned way.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.101
You mean cut him open?

11:41.134 --> 11:42.912
Yeah. Can I vote that
we don't do it that way?

11:42.936 --> 11:44.447
Don't worry. I'm gonna
use a local anesthetic.

11:44.471 --> 11:45.472
Can you go and find me

11:45.505 --> 11:46.706
a bag of B-positive?
All right.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.208
And I need
to find a scalpel.

11:48.241 --> 11:50.944
Hey.

11:51.411 --> 11:52.445
You okay?

11:52.479 --> 11:54.014
You look worse
than I do.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.549
Yeah, I-I just don't like
this kind of thing.

11:56.583 --> 11:57.918
People I know getting sick.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.920
Oh, don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.

11:59.953 --> 12:03.924
You go to Boylan's or something,
get a drink with Josh.

12:03.957 --> 12:06.526
No. God.
I'm staying here with you.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.261
That's cool, too.

12:11.498 --> 12:12.732
What's going on, Daddy?

12:12.766 --> 12:15.168
Not sure.

12:15.202 --> 12:19.072
We'll let someone know, then
we'll go have some lunch, okay?

12:24.711 --> 12:27.280
Looks like
we lost power to the locks.

12:27.314 --> 12:28.882
Maintenance Alpha,

12:28.916 --> 12:30.583
this is Jim Shannon.

12:30.617 --> 12:32.719
We need a repair team
at the Eye.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.522
Maintenance, please respond.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.224
What's wrong?

12:37.257 --> 12:39.793
I don't know.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.962
My comm has its own
power supply.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.596
It should be working.

12:43.630 --> 12:46.066
Something fused the circuits.

12:46.099 --> 12:49.669
I'm guessing it's the same thing
that knocked out this room.

12:49.702 --> 12:52.105
So we're stuck
in here?

12:55.809 --> 12:57.878
I don't get it.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.712
The cell's charged,
but for some reason,

12:59.746 --> 13:01.681
it's not getting
power to the engine.

13:01.714 --> 13:03.583
Ferrous metals.

13:05.018 --> 13:07.454
Well, if there was
a high enough concentration

13:07.487 --> 13:08.555
of them in that meteor,

13:08.588 --> 13:11.058
then the explosion could have
given off an EMP pulse.

13:11.091 --> 13:13.693
Okay, first off, how do you even
know something like that?

13:13.726 --> 13:15.362
And secondly,
if you're right,

13:15.395 --> 13:17.064
that means...

13:17.965 --> 13:20.400
...we got no radio.

13:21.768 --> 13:23.003
So what are we gonna do?

13:23.036 --> 13:24.905
Just wait for someone
to come get us?

13:24.938 --> 13:26.673
No one knows we're out here.

13:26.706 --> 13:30.110
Man, I should have told one of
my guys where we were going.

13:30.143 --> 13:33.180
Well, my dad will be
looking for me.

13:33.213 --> 13:34.681
Yeah.

13:34.714 --> 13:37.851
He's probably gonna kill me

13:37.885 --> 13:39.786
and ground you
until the Ice Age.

13:42.222 --> 13:43.991
All right, we're six klicks out.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.959
We can make it before dark.

13:45.993 --> 13:48.929
Let's go. Well, what
about the weapon?

13:48.962 --> 13:49.897
Does that not work, either?

13:49.930 --> 13:52.199
Electronic firing pin.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.502
We're gonna be okay.

13:55.535 --> 13:57.971
All right, we just got
to hustle, all right?

13:58.005 --> 14:00.740
Okay, let's go this way.

14:07.747 --> 14:09.149
Okay, the good news is

14:09.182 --> 14:11.518
that we do have a contingency
for such matters.

14:11.551 --> 14:12.219
This...

14:12.252 --> 14:13.921
This is the chip fabricator.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.855
It's capable of producing

14:15.889 --> 14:17.000
any replacement chips
we need.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.625
And the bad news?

14:18.658 --> 14:24.031
This is the chip
that runs the chip fabricator.

14:24.064 --> 14:27.400
Oh, it's fused
like all the others.

14:27.434 --> 14:30.303
Can't repair it, but if you can
find someone who can,

14:30.337 --> 14:33.106
then I can crank out replacement
chips by the dozen.

14:33.140 --> 14:35.042
Commander, we both know someone
who can do this.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.144
Not going down that road, Wash.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.011
He was a munitions officer,

14:38.045 --> 14:39.679
a damn good one.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.414
Plus he's got
all the gear.

14:44.851 --> 14:47.154
Can I fix it?

14:50.257 --> 14:52.892
Sure. It's not that much
different than fixing

14:52.926 --> 14:55.929
an old watch.
Lost art, sadly.

14:55.963 --> 14:58.598
You know, it's times
like this reminds you

14:58.631 --> 15:01.068
that the simple things
in life are often better.

15:01.101 --> 15:03.036
I mean, why, right now,

15:03.070 --> 15:04.904
I'm the only person
in this colony

15:04.938 --> 15:06.173
who knows what time it is.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.108
What time can I have it?

15:08.141 --> 15:10.010
I need it as of right now.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.945
I said I could fix it.

15:11.979 --> 15:13.746
I didn't say I would.

15:13.780 --> 15:14.814
What's in it for me?

15:14.847 --> 15:16.883
We're talking about the welfare
of the colony here,

15:16.916 --> 15:17.985
you son of a...
Well,

15:18.018 --> 15:19.586
that's no way

15:19.619 --> 15:21.121
to haggle, Taylor.

15:21.154 --> 15:22.898
You can't just throw it
all out there like that.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.891
Now I know I can ask

15:24.924 --> 15:26.059
for pretty much anything.

15:26.093 --> 15:27.961
So, what do you want, Boylan?

15:27.995 --> 15:30.030
Statue maybe in the center
of the market?

15:30.063 --> 15:32.865
Now, there's an idea.

15:32.899 --> 15:34.801
Me on a Pegasus.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.269
Bottle of whiskey
in one hand,

15:36.303 --> 15:39.306
bolt of lightning in the
other, Viking hat on the...

15:40.173 --> 15:41.841
On the other hand,
I could just let you

15:41.874 --> 15:45.312
have a peaceful night's sleep
with four unbroken limbs.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.614
Uh, yup, that-that'll work.

15:47.647 --> 15:49.682
I need that ASAP.

15:54.921 --> 15:56.356
Daddy?

15:56.389 --> 15:57.624
Yeah?

15:58.825 --> 16:01.761
You know the elec-tro-thing

16:01.794 --> 16:02.996
you told me about?

16:04.064 --> 16:05.865
Can it hurt people?

16:05.898 --> 16:07.100
Oh, no, not people, honey.

16:07.134 --> 16:09.802
Just, uh, computers and vehicles

16:09.836 --> 16:11.104
and communicators and stuff.

16:11.138 --> 16:12.905
Would it hurt you

16:12.939 --> 16:14.841
if you were a robot?

16:14.874 --> 16:16.543
If you were a robot?
Probably.

16:16.576 --> 16:19.312
What if you were in a truck?
Would it crash?

16:19.346 --> 16:23.016
Yes, but we're not in a truck,
and we're not robots,

16:23.050 --> 16:25.718
so... we're safe here.

16:27.054 --> 16:30.823
What about Mommy
and Maddy and Josh?

16:30.857 --> 16:32.425
Oh, I'm sure they're fine,

16:32.459 --> 16:35.095
and as soon as we get out
of this room,

16:35.128 --> 16:36.172
we'll find them and make sure.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.098
Hey, help me out
with this, will you, Z?

16:38.131 --> 16:40.833
Just grab it. Lift.

16:40.867 --> 16:43.236
Good girl.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.008
What are we doing?

16:49.042 --> 16:52.011
I think this is
an access hatch.

16:52.045 --> 16:55.382
And if we can
crawl through here,

16:55.415 --> 16:58.218
should be able to open the
door on the other side.

17:13.099 --> 17:15.034
Uh, found it.

17:15.068 --> 17:16.502
Okay, clamp.

17:18.105 --> 17:19.872
Wait, wait, wait.
I think I felt that.

17:19.906 --> 17:21.074
Just relax.

17:21.108 --> 17:22.242
It's all in your head.

17:22.275 --> 17:23.919
I'm telling you.
I just-just felt something.

17:23.943 --> 17:26.122
I gave you a local anesthetic,
Hunter, so that's impossible.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.047
Doc, can't you just put me under
or something?

17:28.080 --> 17:30.150
Well, yeah,
normally I would, but

17:30.183 --> 17:32.485
since your bed is off line,

17:32.519 --> 17:34.187
I won't able to
monitor your vitals.

17:34.221 --> 17:37.056
So I've got its tail.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.125
Yeah.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.127
Is it bad?

17:40.160 --> 17:41.994
No. It's just...

17:42.028 --> 17:43.062
It's a little guy.

17:43.096 --> 17:45.598
Oh, God, can somebody just
get this thing out of me?!

17:45.632 --> 17:47.567
Hunter, you need
to sit still, okay?

17:47.600 --> 17:49.202
I've got this thing
by the tail.

17:49.236 --> 17:52.139
That means that its head,
mouth and teeth

17:52.172 --> 17:54.107
are still
inside you. Now,

17:54.141 --> 17:56.209
if I go too fast,

17:56.243 --> 17:58.111
it's gonna start biting.

17:58.145 --> 18:00.113
So you just lie still

18:00.147 --> 18:03.350
and calm, okay?
Just breathe.

18:03.383 --> 18:06.186
Hey. You're gonna be fine.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.455
Just 25 more feet to go.

18:22.135 --> 18:24.171
I've got word
from our spotter.

18:24.204 --> 18:26.339
That meteor kicked out
an EMP.

18:26.373 --> 18:28.074
The whole colony went dark.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.609
Even their
perimeter is down.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.077
Gather up.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.813
We're going in.

18:33.846 --> 18:37.350
Taylor's going to have
every man he's got on alert.

18:37.384 --> 18:38.718
We're still outnumbered.

18:38.751 --> 18:41.721
I have an idea that might
help us even the odds.

19:08.848 --> 19:11.351
Boylan's going to need
at least a few more hours.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.085
Let's make sure
that the first circuit

19:13.119 --> 19:15.855
that the fabricator spits out
goes right to the infirmary.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.056
We got sick people there.

19:17.089 --> 19:18.791
Let's get that place up
and running.

19:18.825 --> 19:19.826
Will do.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.361
With our perimeter down,

19:21.394 --> 19:26.366
no weapons, only thing
we got is the fence.

19:28.535 --> 19:33.606
There are things out there
that can snap it like a twig.

19:33.640 --> 19:36.343
We need another line of defense.

19:44.351 --> 19:45.685
We're still about
four klicks out.

19:45.718 --> 19:48.821
Yeah, I don't think we're
going to make it by nightfall.

19:50.657 --> 19:53.025
I think
you're probably right.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.268
What are you doing?

20:02.902 --> 20:04.404
Is that a new outfit?

20:04.437 --> 20:05.938
Yup. 20 terras.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.807
My mom got it for me. Why?

20:07.840 --> 20:08.975
Mark!

20:09.008 --> 20:10.743
Sorry. It's necessary.

20:10.777 --> 20:11.978
For what?!

20:12.011 --> 20:13.813
Camouflage.

20:15.848 --> 20:16.716
Oh, it smells like...

20:16.749 --> 20:18.985
Oh, I-I know
what it smells like.

20:19.018 --> 20:20.787
Cycadeoidea.

20:20.820 --> 20:24.291
Known in the field
as stink leaves.

20:25.958 --> 20:27.494
I think I might puke on you.

20:27.527 --> 20:29.729
Oh, come on. You're
tougher than that.

20:29.762 --> 20:33.800
And thanks to me, you're also
almost invisible to carnos,

20:33.833 --> 20:35.902
slashers and nykos.

20:35.935 --> 20:39.171
They hate the smell
just as much as you do.

20:40.673 --> 20:41.641
Your turn.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.743
Hmm. Gladly.

20:45.144 --> 20:47.013
You should consider
yourself lucky.

20:47.046 --> 20:48.056
Stink leaves are
an alternative.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.215
Hmm? To what?

20:49.248 --> 20:52.319
Slasher dung.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.621
You missed a spot.

20:58.190 --> 21:00.126
Dr. Shannon!

21:00.159 --> 21:02.028
They were in a rover

21:02.061 --> 21:03.861
when the shock wave hit,
flipped over a ridge.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.667
Skye, come here.
I need your help.

21:07.700 --> 21:08.968
You see what I'm doing here?

21:09.001 --> 21:10.136
Just turning this rod

21:10.169 --> 21:11.738
to pull the parasite out, okay?

21:11.771 --> 21:14.273
Now, if it tugs back,
you just pause for a minute,

21:14.307 --> 21:17.109
wait till it gives way, and then
you continue with the process.

21:17.143 --> 21:18.611
Put some gloves on.

21:18.645 --> 21:21.280
All right, slow and steady.

21:26.252 --> 21:29.255
We came here on the
same pilgrimage, and

21:29.288 --> 21:30.857
ever since my
parents died,

21:30.890 --> 21:33.259
he's the closest thing
I have to family.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.328
He's like my brother.

21:35.362 --> 21:36.896
I can't... Everything's
gonna be fine

21:36.929 --> 21:38.765
if you just keep
doing this very slowly.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.433
I have to go and help
those people,

21:40.467 --> 21:42.435
so take a hold of this,
all right?

21:42.469 --> 21:44.170
Slow and steady, okay? Okay.

21:44.203 --> 21:45.972
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

21:46.005 --> 21:47.640
Okay.

21:48.875 --> 21:51.544
Slow and steady.

21:51.578 --> 21:52.879
See?

21:52.912 --> 21:53.913
Nothing to it.

21:53.946 --> 21:57.116
You do the hard part,
I'll do the laying down part

21:57.149 --> 21:59.018
if that's okay.

21:59.051 --> 22:01.087
You and me together, right?

22:01.120 --> 22:02.889
That's right.

22:02.922 --> 22:06.058
You and me together.

22:20.106 --> 22:21.340
What was that?

22:21.374 --> 22:22.509
What?

22:22.542 --> 22:25.177
Did you... did you see that?

22:29.148 --> 22:30.983
Oh, my God!

22:31.017 --> 22:32.552
Tree climb.
Come on.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.922
I thought you said
the stink leaves would work!

22:35.955 --> 22:37.957
They're not
a hundred percent, okay? Up!

22:37.990 --> 22:40.059
Use your feet!

22:40.092 --> 22:41.461
I'm trying!

22:41.494 --> 22:44.096
All right, look,
I don't mean to be rude, but...

22:58.177 --> 22:59.746
They're moving on.

23:00.547 --> 23:02.849
That sounded like...
Nykoraptors.

23:04.316 --> 23:08.154
I think we should stay up here
until the sun comes up. Yeah.

23:16.062 --> 23:18.130
Why is this thing still on?

23:18.164 --> 23:20.199
Well, 'cause
it's shielded,

23:20.232 --> 23:23.069
it has its own power supply.

23:23.102 --> 23:25.972
Hey, Zoe?

23:26.005 --> 23:27.139
Come here, sweetie.

23:32.845 --> 23:34.313
Hey, um...

23:34.346 --> 23:36.516
do you remember that handle

23:36.549 --> 23:38.184
on the other
side of the wall?

23:38.217 --> 23:39.786
The one beside the door?

23:39.819 --> 23:40.920
Yeah. Yeah.

23:40.953 --> 23:42.622
Now, that's a
manual override.

23:42.655 --> 23:46.192
You pull that handle down,
and it opens the door.

23:46.225 --> 23:49.496
This shaft leads to the
other side of the wall.

23:49.529 --> 23:52.298
But it's too small for me.

23:52.331 --> 23:54.400
Someone your size,
well, I mean,

23:54.433 --> 23:56.168
you'd fit just right.

23:56.202 --> 23:58.104
Think you could do that?

23:58.137 --> 24:00.239
Crawl through here and...

24:00.272 --> 24:03.042
pull down on
that handle?

24:08.180 --> 24:10.282
No.

24:10.316 --> 24:12.952
No? Oh, there's nothing
to be scared of, sweetie.

24:12.985 --> 24:13.986
I'll be right here.

24:14.020 --> 24:16.322
What about... spiders?

24:16.355 --> 24:18.625
Spiders. Well...

24:18.658 --> 24:20.827
I hate spiders.

24:20.860 --> 24:22.261
So do I.

24:22.294 --> 24:23.362
At least I used to...

24:23.395 --> 24:25.431
But I'm not scared
of them anymore.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.267
'Cause I learned the, uh...

24:28.300 --> 24:31.270
the "Go Away Spider Song."

24:36.342 --> 24:37.610
No, I'm serious
it really works.

24:37.644 --> 24:39.912
I used it all the time
when I was your age.

24:39.946 --> 24:42.715
I don't know the words.
Oh, but I'll sing it for you.

24:44.150 --> 24:48.921
You're the only
one who can do this, Zoe.

24:50.723 --> 24:53.492
We need to find Mommy
and the others.

24:53.526 --> 24:55.562
Okay?

25:33.399 --> 25:36.535
Go! Go!

25:37.436 --> 25:40.139
More fire to the left flank!

25:40.172 --> 25:43.342
Keep him moving north!

25:43.375 --> 25:45.211
All the way to the gates!

25:45.244 --> 25:48.247
All the way to Terra Nova!

25:48.280 --> 25:50.482
Ram it down Taylor's throat.

26:01.427 --> 26:03.429
So, you're gonna
follow that tunnel

26:03.462 --> 26:04.797
till you get to the other side.

26:04.831 --> 26:07.199
Then you're gonna
pull down on that handle

26:07.233 --> 26:09.135
as hard as you can, okay?

26:09.168 --> 26:11.070
Okay.

26:11.103 --> 26:13.572
That's my girl.

26:17.009 --> 26:18.344
You okay?

26:18.377 --> 26:20.680
Yes, Daddy.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.291
What's wrong?

26:32.324 --> 26:33.993
The song, Daddy.

26:35.394 --> 26:37.496
Yeah, right. Um...

26:55.047 --> 26:58.350
I don't want to be
like a brother to you.

26:58.384 --> 27:00.252
What?

27:00.286 --> 27:04.590
It kills me that you're
in love with Josh, you know?

27:04.623 --> 27:06.058
What are you talking about?

27:06.092 --> 27:08.661
Everybody knows.

27:08.695 --> 27:10.429
Except maybe Josh.

27:10.462 --> 27:12.364
Okay, just... lie still.

27:14.566 --> 27:15.802
You know what?

27:15.835 --> 27:19.405
I always thought
that maybe...

27:19.438 --> 27:20.873
one day...

27:20.907 --> 27:23.743
me and you might...

27:23.776 --> 27:26.779
What?

27:26.813 --> 27:28.815
I'm good, I'm good.
Are you sure?

27:28.848 --> 27:31.017
No, it's doing something. Okay.

27:32.785 --> 27:33.720
What just happened?

27:33.753 --> 27:35.387
Dr. Shannon!

27:35.421 --> 27:36.555
Okay.

27:36.588 --> 27:37.724
Don't panic.

27:38.524 --> 27:39.859
Nurse Ogawa!

27:39.892 --> 27:42.604
Okay, I'm probably not gonna be
able to get ahold of this thing again.

27:42.628 --> 27:43.830
Skye?

27:43.863 --> 27:45.698
Skye, listen to me.
Yeah. Yeah.

27:45.732 --> 27:48.376
This is not your fault, but I need you
to do something for me now, okay?

27:48.400 --> 27:50.045
Go to Boylan's... they're
making a microcircuit there.

27:50.069 --> 27:51.838
Go and bring me
back a chip

27:51.871 --> 27:53.706
for a class three biobed.
Now, go.

27:53.740 --> 27:56.308
What about Hunter? I'll do
everything I can for him. Now, go.

27:56.342 --> 27:57.409
Go!

27:57.443 --> 27:59.045
Okay.

28:09.856 --> 28:11.824
The song, Daddy.

28:11.858 --> 28:13.760
Okay, okay. Uh...

28:22.601 --> 28:24.536
I'm sorry about all this.

28:24.570 --> 28:28.975
It wasn't how our first date
alone was supposed to go.

28:29.008 --> 28:30.743
I should've waited
a couple of weeks

28:30.777 --> 28:33.946
and asked your parents if I could
take you to the Harvest Festival.

28:33.980 --> 28:37.049
Don't blame yourself.

28:38.484 --> 28:41.587
I mean, it was kind of
my idea to sneak out, so...

28:41.620 --> 28:44.023
It sort of was,
wasn't it?

28:44.056 --> 28:46.993
You're kind of a bad
influence on me.

28:53.165 --> 28:56.635
Sounds like
they found food.

29:02.641 --> 29:04.210
Mark?

29:04.243 --> 29:05.577
Yeah?

29:05.611 --> 29:08.347
Do you think
we'll die out here?

29:12.551 --> 29:16.722
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you, Maddy.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.158
'Kay? Not tonight,

29:19.191 --> 29:22.028
not ever.

29:24.196 --> 29:25.898
'Kay, good.

29:25.932 --> 29:28.067
Because I was
this close

29:28.100 --> 29:30.536
to asking you to kiss me...

29:30.569 --> 29:35.274
so that I'd know what
it was like before I died.

29:36.308 --> 29:37.643
Well...

29:37.676 --> 29:40.046
maybe I should.

29:40.079 --> 29:43.315
You know, just-just in case.

29:57.997 --> 30:01.300
Now I can die.

30:06.405 --> 30:09.241
Zoe? How you
doing there, pumpkin?

30:09.275 --> 30:11.810
You see it?

30:14.113 --> 30:15.581
Zoe?

30:15.614 --> 30:17.216
Zoe?

30:17.249 --> 30:18.450
Zoe!

30:23.422 --> 30:25.324
Zoe, are you there?

30:25.357 --> 30:27.093
Can you hear me?

30:33.165 --> 30:36.035
Did you see
any spiders down there?

30:36.068 --> 30:38.604
Nope. The song worked.

30:44.743 --> 30:47.413
Hey, Reilly, we've been stuck in
the Eye all day. What's going on?

30:47.446 --> 30:48.447
Meteor caused an EMP.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.016
Whole colony's gone dark.

30:50.049 --> 30:51.383
Don't worry, your
family's safe.

30:51.417 --> 30:52.318
I need your help.

30:52.351 --> 30:55.021
Hey, you remember
Private Reilly, don't you?

30:55.054 --> 30:56.923
Yeah, she's nice.
I want you to go with her

30:56.956 --> 30:59.225
while I check in with
Commander Taylor, okay?

30:59.258 --> 30:59.992
Okay.

31:00.026 --> 31:00.993
I'll take her
to school.

31:01.027 --> 31:02.761
A bunch of the other
kids are staying there

31:02.794 --> 31:03.994
until power comes back. Great.

31:09.969 --> 31:11.103
Hey, hey.

31:11.137 --> 31:12.972
Everything's
gonna be okay,

31:13.005 --> 31:14.173
I promise.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.741
Now, go be
with your friends.

31:15.774 --> 31:16.774
Go.

31:21.113 --> 31:22.949
Stand ready, everyone!

31:23.882 --> 31:25.918
Shannon, where
the hell you been?

31:25.952 --> 31:27.419
Eh, stuck in the Eye.

31:27.453 --> 31:29.888
Maybe you should've
stayed there.

31:29.922 --> 31:31.157
It's about to get ugly.

31:57.149 --> 31:58.650
You got a plan?

32:03.689 --> 32:07.326
I gonna need both of them.

32:07.359 --> 32:09.328
You know how to use
these, right?

32:09.361 --> 32:11.930
Yeah, but won't this
just piss him off...

32:11.964 --> 32:13.732
even more?

32:15.968 --> 32:17.469
Wash.

32:19.038 --> 32:20.372
70 yards.

32:20.406 --> 32:22.008
No further.

32:34.486 --> 32:37.189
Good shot.

32:44.230 --> 32:46.265
What the hell is that?

32:50.436 --> 32:53.339
There's something on his back.

32:57.076 --> 32:58.110
It's a diversion.

32:58.144 --> 32:59.178
It's a diversion.

32:59.211 --> 33:00.279
We're being duped.

33:00.312 --> 33:03.515
They're probably
already inside.

33:03.549 --> 33:04.450
Sixers.

33:04.483 --> 33:05.951
Mira...

33:05.984 --> 33:07.786
she's after the box.

33:07.819 --> 33:09.588
Wash, stay on
the fence.

33:09.621 --> 33:11.223
Shannon, with me.

33:11.257 --> 33:14.693
Come on.

33:20.132 --> 33:21.500
Yes!

33:23.469 --> 33:27.539
There we have it, a
working chip for a biobed.

33:27.573 --> 33:30.142
Not too bad if I
do say so myself.

33:30.176 --> 33:31.343
Please tell me
you're done.

33:31.377 --> 33:33.179
Hunter's not going to make it.

33:33.212 --> 33:36.014
Okay, go. Go.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.084
Skye.

33:38.117 --> 33:39.618
Go. I'll catch up.

35:10.576 --> 35:12.511
He's a big bastard,
isn't he?

35:12.544 --> 35:13.612
Shannon,
he's got the box.

35:13.645 --> 35:14.713
What about him?

35:14.746 --> 35:16.648
I'll take care of him.

35:23.222 --> 35:25.224
Let's dance.

36:00.326 --> 36:02.728
Easy there, fella.

36:02.761 --> 36:04.563
Now this thing?

36:04.596 --> 36:07.399
It may be an older
model, but trust me...

36:08.267 --> 36:10.702
...it still works.

36:16.475 --> 36:18.143
I had him
right where I wanted him.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.278
But thanks.

36:19.311 --> 36:21.280
Oh, well, lucky.

36:21.913 --> 36:24.182
Only had one bullet.

37:04.022 --> 37:05.022
Mira!

37:48.334 --> 37:51.337
Parasite's dead.

37:52.137 --> 37:54.906
He'll be okay.

37:56.308 --> 37:58.377
Hey, you did brilliantly.

37:58.410 --> 38:00.178
Really well.

38:11.557 --> 38:13.592
Why was Mira so obsessed

38:13.625 --> 38:15.794
with getting her hands
on this box?

38:15.827 --> 38:17.262
What's in it?

38:17.295 --> 38:18.430
God only knows.

38:18.464 --> 38:20.699
I never got the chance to finish
studying it.

38:20.732 --> 38:23.602
This was a surgical strike.

38:23.635 --> 38:25.136
Mira knew exactly where to look.

38:25.170 --> 38:28.574
You think someone inside
Terra Nova tipped her off.

38:28.607 --> 38:32.978
I don't think... I know.

38:33.011 --> 38:35.914
Shannon, we've got to
hunt down this spy.

38:35.947 --> 38:38.550
This is unacceptable.

38:53.365 --> 38:55.967
Sunlight.

38:57.436 --> 38:59.905
Oh, dozed off.

38:59.938 --> 39:02.107
It's morning.

39:03.041 --> 39:06.344
Well, good morning then.

39:06.378 --> 39:08.346
Good morning.

39:08.947 --> 39:10.516
Morning? Oh, my God.

39:10.549 --> 39:12.017
My dad's going
to be looking for me.

39:12.050 --> 39:13.284
We gotta go.

39:13.318 --> 39:14.920
Oh, right, right.
Okay, let's go.

39:17.656 --> 39:19.791
Mark?

39:21.126 --> 39:24.362
Thank you for the perfect day.

39:39.144 --> 39:40.646
Hey, Josh?

39:40.679 --> 39:42.113
Yeah?

39:42.147 --> 39:45.150
Why don't we ask Skye over
for dinner one night.

39:46.084 --> 39:48.954
Yeah, okay. Sure.

39:48.987 --> 39:51.356
Yeah?

39:51.389 --> 39:52.624
Okay, good.

39:52.658 --> 39:54.726
Put a date on the calendar.

39:55.827 --> 39:57.062
Wait, what?

39:57.095 --> 39:58.096
What?

39:58.129 --> 39:59.130
What are you doing?

39:59.164 --> 40:01.066
I'm not doing anything.
I just... I like her.

40:01.099 --> 40:02.968
Hey.
Hi.

40:03.001 --> 40:04.069
Mom...

40:04.102 --> 40:06.071
What?

40:06.104 --> 40:07.839
Hey.
Oh, great.

40:07.873 --> 40:10.075
We can finally
have a coffee.

40:10.108 --> 40:10.976
How was your night?

40:11.009 --> 40:13.044
Oh, you know,
same old, same old.

40:14.480 --> 40:15.947
Oh, my gosh.

40:15.981 --> 40:18.149
Did you see that thing
at the gate?

40:18.183 --> 40:19.985
The dinosaur?

40:20.018 --> 40:21.186
Was it big?

40:21.219 --> 40:24.523
It was the biggest
and we had to shoot these...

40:24.556 --> 40:25.991
Wait, where's Maddy?

40:26.024 --> 40:27.325
I don't know. Maddy?

40:27.358 --> 40:29.060
Maddy?

40:29.094 --> 40:30.896
Maddy?!

40:30.929 --> 40:32.339
Oh, hey, guys.
Didn't hear you come in.

40:32.363 --> 40:34.232
Hey. How did your homework go?

40:34.265 --> 40:36.067
Yeah, it was good.

40:36.101 --> 40:38.003
Um, I had to use chem light,

40:38.036 --> 40:39.538
but I got tons done.

40:39.571 --> 40:41.206
What's that smell?

40:42.073 --> 40:43.775
What is that?

40:44.943 --> 40:46.678
Do you guys smell that?
Yeah.

40:46.712 --> 40:48.647
Yeah, it's probably
the garbage incinerator

40:48.680 --> 40:50.348
because the power's out

40:50.381 --> 40:52.050
so it gets a bit stinky.
You know.

40:52.083 --> 40:53.485
Right.

40:53.519 --> 40:54.920
I'm going to...

41:10.068 --> 41:13.004
You sure this is the place?

41:13.038 --> 41:16.808
With him, I'm not
sure about anything.

41:22.080 --> 41:24.716
I don't think
he's going to show.

41:36.194 --> 41:38.329
You made it.

41:38.363 --> 41:40.732
I was starting to worry.

41:41.567 --> 41:43.201
Give it to me.

41:43.234 --> 41:45.203
Not even a thank you?

41:47.505 --> 41:50.408
Uh, I've been alone
out here for so long,

41:50.441 --> 41:52.277
I've forgotten
my manners.

41:52.310 --> 41:55.046
Thank you, thank you...

41:55.080 --> 41:57.649
for finally
getting your act together

41:57.683 --> 42:01.119
and doing what you were
sent here to do.

42:01.152 --> 42:03.288
Give it to me.

42:04.355 --> 42:06.524
I was told to bring this
through the portal with me

42:06.558 --> 42:07.993
and make sure it got to you.

42:08.026 --> 42:10.128
Took a little longer
than expected,

42:10.161 --> 42:12.097
thanks to Taylor, but
now that you've got it,

42:12.130 --> 42:14.165
I want to know,

42:14.199 --> 42:16.234
what the hell is it for?

42:17.068 --> 42:19.137
My work.

42:19.170 --> 42:20.271
It's for my work.

42:42.493 --> 42:46.197
Beautiful, aren't they?

42:53.739 --> 42:56.274
So much to do.
