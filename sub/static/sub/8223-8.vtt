00:14.535 --> 00:17.403
On this wet-and-wild
episode of "Mythbusters"...

00:17.404 --> 00:18.638
Whoa!

00:18.639 --> 00:19.906
Aaaaah!

00:19.907 --> 00:21.407
Aah!

00:21.408 --> 00:22.842
I'm alive, right?

00:22.843 --> 00:26.713
...It's the biggest, dirtiest,
most vertigo-inducing build

00:26.714 --> 00:28.715
In "Mythbusters" history...

00:28.716 --> 00:30.650
That's one heck of a ramp.

00:30.651 --> 00:35.555
...Testing the fantastical
flight in this viral video.

00:35.556 --> 00:37.323
Whoa!

00:38.559 --> 00:39.726
This is fun.

00:39.727 --> 00:42.061
Meanwhile,
Kari, Tory, and Grant

00:42.062 --> 00:44.130
Deliver the goods...

00:45.633 --> 00:46.966
We're gonna get stuck
on Lombard!

00:46.967 --> 00:49.202
...Finding out
if going the extra distance

00:49.203 --> 00:51.404
And taking
only right-hand turns....

00:51.405 --> 00:53.706
Mcs is coming through!

00:53.707 --> 00:56.542
...Can save you gas.
There you go.

00:56.543 --> 00:58.845
Who knew packages
could be so exciting?

01:01.382 --> 01:03.416
Who are the Mythbusters?

01:04.285 --> 01:05.318
Adam savage...

01:05.319 --> 01:07.720
70% chance of science.

01:07.721 --> 01:09.022
...And Jamie Hyneman.

01:09.023 --> 01:10.423
We're gonna have an adventure.

01:10.424 --> 01:12.392
Between them, more than 30 years

01:12.393 --> 01:14.093
Of special-effects experience.

01:15.529 --> 01:17.764
Joining them...

01:17.765 --> 01:19.065
Grant Imahara...

01:19.066 --> 01:20.300
Formidable projectile.

01:20.301 --> 01:21.401
Kari Byron...

01:21.402 --> 01:22.468
Let's do it.

01:22.469 --> 01:23.469
...And Tory Belleci.

01:23.470 --> 01:25.171
Wasn't ready for that one,
Kari.

01:25.172 --> 01:27.006
They don't just tell the myths.

01:28.008 --> 01:30.743
They put them to the test.

01:42.556 --> 01:44.824
You're wearing a face mask.

01:44.825 --> 01:47.360
You're very observant.
Why?

01:47.361 --> 01:50.163
Why are you observant,
or why am I wearing a face mask?

01:52.232 --> 01:54.801
Okay.
I'm wearing a face mask

01:54.802 --> 01:57.603
Because we're doing
a fairly damp story.

01:57.604 --> 02:00.239
This is a Youtube clip
that's pretty famous

02:00.240 --> 02:02.809
And got sent to us
by just about everyone,

02:02.810 --> 02:06.012
In which a man is seen
sliding down a water slide,

02:06.013 --> 02:08.080
Launching himself off a ramp,

02:08.082 --> 02:12.118
Flying a seemingly impossible
length through the air,

02:12.119 --> 02:14.554
And landing in a little,
tiny swimming pool.

02:14.555 --> 02:16.489
And so you want us
to test this?

02:16.490 --> 02:18.991
Oh, I want to test this.

02:18.992 --> 02:23.296
It's a death-defying
viral-video stunt

02:23.297 --> 02:25.164
With over 4 million hits,

02:25.165 --> 02:27.867
But is this incredible feat
legit,

02:27.868 --> 02:30.503
Or is it a slide-show sham?

02:30.504 --> 02:32.672
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

02:32.673 --> 02:34.307
Where do you want to start?

02:34.308 --> 02:35.875
Well, as much as I'd love

02:35.876 --> 02:38.511
To just build a big, old slide
and slide down it,

02:38.512 --> 02:40.980
Something tells me that
that might be dangerous.

02:40.981 --> 02:43.483
Yeah. So I'm thinking we
should start here in the shop

02:43.484 --> 02:45.151
And do a kind of proof
of concept.

02:45.152 --> 02:46.552
To see
whether we think we can get

02:46.553 --> 02:48.020
That kind of distance
and precision.

02:48.021 --> 02:49.322
Exactly.

02:49.323 --> 02:51.290
Let's start with a small
slide -- a small slider --

02:51.291 --> 02:53.326
Run it through some paces,
and see what we get.

02:53.327 --> 02:55.294
Without putting our bodies
on the line.

02:55.295 --> 02:56.295
Yet.

02:56.296 --> 02:57.864
Yet.

02:57.865 --> 02:59.866
It's a slippery slope
to the truth,

02:59.867 --> 03:02.268
So they're starting with
a proof of concept,

03:02.269 --> 03:05.438
And here's
what they're looking for.

03:05.439 --> 03:08.708
Doing a scale water-slide
experiment is a bit of a problem

03:08.709 --> 03:11.210
Because gravity doesn't scale.

03:11.211 --> 03:14.080
But it's no big deal because
I only need our little dummy

03:14.081 --> 03:17.550
To land in about the same spot
over and over again,

03:17.551 --> 03:19.952
'cause if he doesn't,
he's toast.

03:19.953 --> 03:22.989
Secondly, based on our video,
to scale,

03:22.990 --> 03:26.192
I need him to travel
about 16 feet.

03:26.193 --> 03:29.028
16 feet is the
approximate "'x' marks the spot"

03:29.029 --> 03:30.196
For the kiddy pool.

03:30.197 --> 03:32.665
The blue-colored water

03:32.666 --> 03:36.436
Helps the guys ensure that
the whole slide is lubricated,

03:36.437 --> 03:40.106
And then stunt Adam
takes his first slip.

03:40.107 --> 03:41.941
Slip-and-slide scale test.

03:41.942 --> 03:43.709
3, 2, 1.

03:46.013 --> 03:47.280
Oh!

03:48.415 --> 03:49.882
That's awesome.

03:49.883 --> 03:53.152
He left a little blue stain,
nicely marking where he landed.

03:53.153 --> 03:54.654
9'8".

03:54.655 --> 03:59.125
9 feet is hardly the
16 feet Jamie was looking for,

03:59.126 --> 04:01.794
But the guys have
a slippery trick to try.

04:01.795 --> 04:03.696
Do we want to try it again

04:03.697 --> 04:05.398
But throw a little dish soap
in that water?

04:05.399 --> 04:07.366
Sounds like a good idea.
I'll be right back.

04:07.367 --> 04:10.403
Using soapy water
to further lubricate the slide

04:10.404 --> 04:12.672
Will reduce the friction
on the stuntman...

04:12.673 --> 04:14.040
Oh, yeah.

04:14.041 --> 04:18.411
...Helping him to accelerate
and hopefully fly further.

04:18.411 --> 04:20.012
Here we go.

04:21.949 --> 04:25.785
In 3...2...1.

04:27.321 --> 04:28.521
Boom!

04:28.522 --> 04:30.256
Sure enough,
the soap surfactant's

04:30.257 --> 04:31.958
Made mini Adam go the distance,

04:31.959 --> 04:34.894
But what about accuracy?

04:34.895 --> 04:37.263
Here we go.
Looking for the same spot.

04:40.601 --> 04:41.934
When I look at this rig,
I think,

04:41.935 --> 04:43.836
"he's not gonna hit
the same target every time."

04:43.837 --> 04:45.638
But that's not gonna stop us
from trying,

04:45.639 --> 04:46.772
Is it, little dude?

04:46.773 --> 04:48.541
"oh, I'd rather be done."

04:48.542 --> 04:49.809
No, you got a few more slides.

04:49.810 --> 04:52.445
"okay."
here we go.

04:55.482 --> 04:57.884
I'm not getting tired of that.

04:57.885 --> 05:00.920
It's not tiresome,
but neither is it accurate,

05:00.921 --> 05:02.655
So Jamie's got a plan.

05:02.656 --> 05:06.425
I'm wondering about fixing him
so he's in this position.

05:06.426 --> 05:09.996
Binding the arms and legs
should streamline mini Adam

05:09.997 --> 05:12.698
And help him to land
in the same place twice.

05:12.699 --> 05:14.267
But before he flies,

05:14.268 --> 05:17.436
The slide needs another spritz
of soapy water.

05:17.437 --> 05:19.105
I figure we should use
something like this

05:19.106 --> 05:21.741
For the full-size ramp,
you know, but larger,

05:21.742 --> 05:23.776
Like one of those hand-held
weed sprayers.

05:23.777 --> 05:27.013
I can't see it putting out
anywhere near enough liquid.

05:27.014 --> 05:28.047
I think it will.

05:28.048 --> 05:29.415
If you want to bring it,
that's fine.

05:29.416 --> 05:31.617
But, I swear, if we end up
using it to cover the ramp,

05:31.618 --> 05:33.252
I'll pay you 100 bucks.

05:33.253 --> 05:34.420
All right, then.

05:34.421 --> 05:36.489
The gentleman's wager stands,

05:36.490 --> 05:39.559
So the tiny slider
is tossed down the slide...

05:39.560 --> 05:40.693
Zoofa!

05:40.694 --> 05:42.695
...Again...

05:42.696 --> 05:43.829
And again.

05:43.830 --> 05:46.299
Whoo-hoo!
Boom!

05:46.300 --> 05:47.833
That actually was pretty close
to the last one.

05:47.834 --> 05:49.068
It was.

05:49.069 --> 05:51.504
And he even landed
feetfirst again.

05:51.505 --> 05:52.505
Both times?

05:52.506 --> 05:53.906
Yep.
Nice.

05:53.907 --> 05:58.077
And soon enough,
a pattern starts to emerge.

05:58.078 --> 06:01.781
The more they send streamlined
Adam down the slide...

06:01.782 --> 06:03.983
Getting pretty much
in the same area.

06:03.984 --> 06:06.452
Go ahead and mark it again.
I'm getting kind of excited.

06:06.453 --> 06:10.256
...The more predictable
his landings become.

06:11.858 --> 06:14.193
Let's look at how our criteria
stacks up.

06:14.194 --> 06:16.262
The first thing is
that we need our little dummy

06:16.263 --> 06:18.664
To land in exactly
the same spot,

06:18.665 --> 06:21.167
And all these landings
are within a few inches.

06:21.168 --> 06:22.168
That works.

06:22.169 --> 06:23.769
Secondly, to match the video,

06:23.770 --> 06:26.105
We need him to come
to about 16 feet.

06:26.106 --> 06:30.109
And we got landings
between 13 and 19 feet,

06:30.110 --> 06:33.379
So this might actually work.

06:33.380 --> 06:35.081
Aaahh!

06:37.618 --> 06:40.052
I got to say, dude,
looking at these landings

06:40.053 --> 06:42.955
And thinking, like, perhaps
the pool's about this size,

06:42.956 --> 06:45.024
I'm pretty pleased
with the consistency.

06:45.025 --> 06:47.059
So you'd be willing to bet
your life on this one, huh?

06:47.060 --> 06:49.829
No, not -- not just yet.

06:49.830 --> 06:52.765
But it does seem like less
of the lethal choice

06:52.766 --> 06:54.667
It seemed to me when I first
watched the video.

06:54.668 --> 06:58.471
Aaahh!

07:03.243 --> 07:05.311
Okay, now, this next myth
is based on something

07:05.312 --> 07:08.581
That a major package-delivery
company actually does.

07:08.582 --> 07:10.716
They have
a special software program

07:10.717 --> 07:13.252
That custom-designs a route
for their truck drivers

07:13.253 --> 07:15.755
That eliminates as many
left-hand turns as possible.

07:15.756 --> 07:17.356
You know, I've heard this one.

07:17.357 --> 07:20.493
I mean, apparently it's easy for
truck drivers to take a right,

07:20.494 --> 07:22.928
Because all they have to do
is wait for a clearing

07:22.929 --> 07:24.196
And then they can go.

07:24.197 --> 07:26.165
But if you're turning left,
you have to wait for a light

07:26.166 --> 07:28.234
Or you have to wait
for oncoming traffic to clear

07:28.235 --> 07:29.435
Before you can turn.

07:29.436 --> 07:31.504
You're sitting there idling,
and you're wasting fuel.

07:31.505 --> 07:32.905
Wait a minute.

07:32.906 --> 07:34.674
You're telling me, instead
of just making a simple left,

07:34.675 --> 07:36.342
You're gonna go three rights
to get to the same place

07:36.343 --> 07:38.911
And that's more fuel-efficient?
Exactly.

07:38.912 --> 07:40.646
And for a major package-delivery
company,

07:40.647 --> 07:42.114
That's millions of dollars
a year.

07:42.115 --> 07:44.050
Millions.
Cool.

07:44.051 --> 07:46.218
It's a little counterintuitive,

07:46.219 --> 07:48.054
But apparently
you can cut corners

07:48.055 --> 07:51.490
By always going right
and avoiding the lights.

07:51.491 --> 07:53.292
But can you really save gas

07:53.293 --> 07:57.363
By going the extra distance
to eliminate idling?

07:57.364 --> 07:58.731
So, how are we gonna test
this one?

07:58.732 --> 08:00.566
Well, this myth
is about delivery trucks,

08:00.567 --> 08:03.002
But since most of our viewers
don't have access to those,

08:03.003 --> 08:04.637
I think we should start
with a car.

08:04.638 --> 08:06.272
Why don't we take a car,
we'll bypass the fuel tank,

08:06.273 --> 08:08.240
And we'll put in
our own fuel cell?

08:08.241 --> 08:10.176
That way, we can remove it
and weigh it,

08:10.177 --> 08:12.445
And we'll know exactly
how much fuel we're using.

08:12.446 --> 08:13.913
Good idea.
And we'll do two routes.

08:13.914 --> 08:15.715
The first one will be
the most direct route.

08:15.716 --> 08:17.783
And the second one,
we'll eliminate left-hand turns

08:17.784 --> 08:19.118
And do only rights.

08:19.119 --> 08:21.220
And for consistency, we should
have only one driver,

08:21.221 --> 08:22.855
And because
I'm the safest driver,

08:22.856 --> 08:24.590
I think I should be
behind the wheel.

08:24.591 --> 08:25.991
You're the safest driver?

08:27.060 --> 08:28.994
Grant is up for courier duty,

08:28.995 --> 08:30.996
So the team heads
to treasure island

08:30.997 --> 08:32.732
To deliver their mythical Booty.

08:32.732 --> 08:34.967
Now, the myth
is that right-hand turns

08:34.967 --> 08:37.503
Are more fuel-efficient
than left-hand turns.

08:37.504 --> 08:39.004
So we've set out two courses.

08:39.005 --> 08:41.707
We're going to drive both
courses at the same speed,

08:41.707 --> 08:44.410
With the same driving style,
to deliver 12 packages.

08:44.411 --> 08:47.913
This is Adam's "blade runner"
replica pistol.

08:47.914 --> 08:50.616
The more direct left-hand route

08:50.617 --> 08:53.419
Includes a 60-second wait
at traffic lights

08:53.420 --> 08:55.321
But is just .4 of a mile.

08:55.322 --> 08:58.924
The longer right-hand route
eliminates the wait,

08:58.925 --> 09:01.594
But they'll cover .6
of a mile instead.

09:01.595 --> 09:04.130
The routes will be repeated
12 times,

09:04.131 --> 09:07.500
As there are a dozen packages
to deliver.

09:09.870 --> 09:13.172
It's raining.
It was so nice out here.

09:13.173 --> 09:16.142
A slightly damp Grant
and Tory weigh the fuel cell

09:16.143 --> 09:18.811
For their starting weight...

09:18.812 --> 09:21.447
All right,
17.89 pounds.

09:21.448 --> 09:23.249
...Then hook it up to the car.

09:23.250 --> 09:25.951
All right.
Let's deliver these packages.

09:25.952 --> 09:28.821
Whoo-hoo!
We're off.

09:28.822 --> 09:30.990
It's left after left...

09:32.526 --> 09:34.527
Yep, that's the right address.

09:34.528 --> 09:37.163
...And light after light...

09:38.632 --> 09:41.934
...As our left-brain couriers
deliver the goods.

09:41.935 --> 09:43.402
I need you to sign for that.

09:43.403 --> 09:46.238
By the way, your average left
has been 2inutes, 15 seconds.

09:46.239 --> 09:49.909
There's no time to waste
as they complete 12 circuits,

09:49.910 --> 09:54.413
And finally every package is,
uh, safely delivered.

09:54.414 --> 09:55.414
Whoo-hoo!

09:55.415 --> 09:56.515
Yeah!

09:56.516 --> 09:57.950
Yeah!

09:57.951 --> 09:59.819
All right,
we are done with our route.

09:59.820 --> 10:01.420
Let's measure our fuel cell.

10:03.223 --> 10:06.425
Okay,
it's 15.63 pounds.

10:06.426 --> 10:10.596
So that is a difference
of 2.26 pounds.

10:10.597 --> 10:13.199
And you did the run
in 27 minutes and 6 seconds.

10:13.200 --> 10:14.433
All right, that was good time.

10:14.434 --> 10:16.168
Let's reset,
and we'll do the test

10:16.169 --> 10:18.070
Where we just do
right-hand turns only.

10:18.071 --> 10:19.839
17.89.
Perfect.

10:20.941 --> 10:24.343
It's a straightforward process.

10:24.344 --> 10:27.246
Tory and Grant
repeat the delivery dozen...

10:27.247 --> 10:30.282
I feel like we delivered
to this location before.

10:30.951 --> 10:34.486
...But this time
only going right.

10:34.487 --> 10:38.724
All right, so, you're gonna take
a right up here.

10:38.725 --> 10:41.727
And then maybe --
I think you're right.

10:41.728 --> 10:44.230
Right you are, my man.

10:45.866 --> 10:48.801
Grant maintains the same speed
as the previous test,

10:48.802 --> 10:50.436
And the weather conditions
are identical.

10:50.437 --> 10:51.837
Ugh!

10:51.838 --> 10:52.838
However...

10:52.839 --> 10:54.840
You know,
this route feels faster.

10:54.841 --> 10:56.609
I don't know if it is faster.

10:56.610 --> 11:00.145
Well, we're cutting down
by not stopping at lights.

11:00.146 --> 11:01.947
And this time around,

11:01.948 --> 11:05.584
Despite an extra 33%
of distance to cover...

11:05.585 --> 11:08.621
All right,
this is our last stop.

11:08.622 --> 11:12.057
...The parcels are dispatched
in only 21 minutes.

11:12.058 --> 11:14.894
Whoo!
Yeah!

11:14.895 --> 11:16.328
All right,
now it's time to find out

11:16.329 --> 11:18.130
Which is more fuel-efficient --

11:18.131 --> 11:19.899
Left-hand turns
or right-hand turns?

11:19.900 --> 11:23.269
15.55.

11:23.270 --> 11:27.172
So that means the right turn
actually consumed more fuel.

11:27.173 --> 11:29.842
Looks like this one is busted.

11:29.843 --> 11:34.246
It's all about the total
fuel consumption for 12 deliveries.

11:34.247 --> 11:36.949
For our first test,
we did all left-hand turns.

11:36.950 --> 11:39.084
We covered 36 blocks
in 27 minutes.

11:39.085 --> 11:41.987
But for our second test,
with all right-hand turns,

11:41.988 --> 11:44.957
We covered almost twice
the distance -- 60 blocks --

11:44.958 --> 11:46.792
But came in at 21 minutes.

11:46.793 --> 11:50.129
So the left-turn test
used less fuel,

11:50.130 --> 11:52.531
But what does that mean
for the myth?

11:52.532 --> 11:55.734
So, yes, we did find
that the left-turn route

11:55.735 --> 11:58.270
Was more fuel-efficient
than the right-turn route.

11:58.271 --> 12:01.206
But the really important thing
to look at is the difference.

12:01.207 --> 12:07.513
It was miniscule --
4/10 of 1% -- less than 1%.

12:07.514 --> 12:09.715
I think to really get
to the bottom of this,

12:09.716 --> 12:12.084
We need to introduce
a real-world scenario.

12:12.085 --> 12:13.185
Whoo!

12:13.186 --> 12:15.254
Adam and Jamie
take to the skies...

12:15.255 --> 12:16.822
This is fun.

12:16.823 --> 12:19.792
...But first they'll
have to build their mega slide.

12:26.576 --> 12:28.122
The Mythbusters are finding out

12:28.123 --> 12:33.528
If this incredible slide
is real or a flight of fancy.

12:33.529 --> 12:35.563
Whoo-hoo!
Boom!

12:35.564 --> 12:36.464
Zoofa!

12:36.465 --> 12:38.199
And after a proof of concept,

12:38.200 --> 12:41.235
It looks like this
just might fly.

12:43.338 --> 12:45.907
I got to say, I'm astonished
that the small scale

12:45.908 --> 12:48.442
Seems to show that this myth
is not impossible.

12:48.443 --> 12:50.344
Well, then,
it's time to go full scale.

12:50.345 --> 12:51.579
I think it is.

12:51.580 --> 12:53.614
This is kind of dangerous,
though, so the question is,

12:53.615 --> 12:57.118
Are you willing to stake your
life on hitting that pool?

12:57.119 --> 12:59.720
No, I am not, and that's why
I've come up with,

12:59.721 --> 13:01.322
I think, the perfect plan.

13:01.323 --> 13:04.458
See, we don't have to do
this myth on dry ground.

13:04.459 --> 13:07.762
We just need to hit a target
in the shape of a pool.

13:07.763 --> 13:11.332
We could put that target on --
follow me -- a lake!

13:11.333 --> 13:14.068
Then if we miss the target,
we don't die.

13:14.069 --> 13:15.436
It's like a win-win.

13:15.437 --> 13:16.837
Excellent plan.

13:16.838 --> 13:19.974
But before they go big scale,

13:19.975 --> 13:23.511
They need to know
exactly how big it is.

13:23.512 --> 13:26.047
This myth, really,
all comes down to the slide.

13:26.048 --> 13:27.648
How big is it?
How long is it?

13:27.649 --> 13:29.483
What are its overall dimensions?

13:29.484 --> 13:30.851
So I'm gonna spend some time

13:30.852 --> 13:33.087
Getting up close and personal
with the video

13:33.088 --> 13:34.722
To try and extrapolate
those dimensions.

13:34.723 --> 13:37.592
And after some
very thorough extrapolating...

13:37.593 --> 13:39.560
I've got that it's 8 feet wide.
Mm-hmm.

13:39.561 --> 13:41.596
I've extrapolated that
from an earlier shot.

13:41.597 --> 13:45.333
...Adam has the dimension data
on our slide.

13:45.334 --> 13:48.302
It's approximately
200 feet long,

13:48.303 --> 13:52.540
With a slope of 24 degrees
and a ramp 12 feet high,

13:52.541 --> 13:54.342
At an angle of 30 degrees.

13:54.343 --> 13:56.410
So they'll need to find a lake

13:56.411 --> 13:59.847
At the bottom
of a large 24-degree hill.

13:59.848 --> 14:02.516
Well, how about this one?

14:02.517 --> 14:04.518
This has got to be the spot.

14:04.519 --> 14:05.820
It's beautiful.

14:05.821 --> 14:08.823
Get a little of that woodgie
feeling just looking at that.

14:08.824 --> 14:10.958
Yeah, we're gonna get going
pretty fast

14:10.959 --> 14:13.561
By the time we reach
the bottom of this hill.

14:13.562 --> 14:14.562
Awesome.

14:16.431 --> 14:17.932
Oh, my gosh.

14:17.933 --> 14:19.934
It's the ideal location,

14:19.935 --> 14:22.003
But they'll have
to work the angles

14:22.004 --> 14:25.640
To get the 24-degree incline
that this myth requires.

14:25.641 --> 14:27.908
But we are no strangers

14:27.909 --> 14:30.544
To extremely large builds
in pursuit of a story.

14:30.545 --> 14:33.648
It seems to me that the biggest
ones always involve ramps.

14:33.649 --> 14:34.815
I'm thinking specifically
the dirt mound

14:34.816 --> 14:35.850
For "the Dukes of Hazzard"
jump...

14:37.786 --> 14:40.087
Oh, my lord.

14:40.088 --> 14:43.758
... And the huge container ramp
for the rocket car.

14:43.759 --> 14:44.925
That ramp held up a tree!

14:46.261 --> 14:50.131
But behind me,
in sheer size and tonnage,

14:50.132 --> 14:54.268
Is the biggest build
we have ever undertaken.

14:54.269 --> 14:55.670
Adam's right.

14:55.671 --> 14:57.805
With over 200 cubic yards
of dirt

14:57.806 --> 15:01.475
Required to make their ramp,
this could take a while.

15:01.476 --> 15:03.878
Still got a little ways to go.

15:03.879 --> 15:07.648
And as the sun sets
on day 1 of this mammoth build,

15:07.649 --> 15:12.520
Their slope is more molehill
than mountain.

15:12.521 --> 15:16.190
But luckily next morning
brings reinforcements.

15:18.760 --> 15:21.495
These guys are pretty good,
and they did great work for us.

15:21.496 --> 15:24.332
But we still got a ways to go,
and we needed some extra help,

15:24.333 --> 15:29.103
So allow me to introduce you
to some extra help.

15:29.104 --> 15:31.105
* yeah *

15:38.380 --> 15:39.780
That was quick.

15:39.781 --> 15:42.249
Sometimes you need the right tool.

15:42.250 --> 15:45.453
Yep, in five minutes,
the massive earthmover

15:45.454 --> 15:49.123
Has completed what it took them
a whole day yesterday to do,

15:49.124 --> 15:51.659
So the guys get to work
on their ramp.

15:52.828 --> 15:55.629
First, Jamie puts a new slant
on danger...

15:57.366 --> 15:59.300
...As he tamps down
any loose earth.

15:59.301 --> 16:02.136
You'll notice I'm only
going up and down the ramp

16:02.137 --> 16:03.437
With the bucket first,

16:03.438 --> 16:05.906
Because I'm worried
that if I went the other way,

16:05.907 --> 16:08.142
I might flip over backwards.

16:09.444 --> 16:12.613
...While Adam works the
planks, building the takeoff ramp.

16:16.184 --> 16:17.785
What are we doing?!

16:17.786 --> 16:19.987
* yeah *

16:24.059 --> 16:27.762
52 sheets of plywood
are slid down the slope,

16:27.763 --> 16:30.531
And the slide starts
to take shape.

16:30.532 --> 16:33.100
It's beautiful.

16:33.101 --> 16:34.969
It looks great.

16:37.305 --> 16:39.306
You first.

16:39.307 --> 16:42.176
And now that they're out
of the woods,

16:42.177 --> 16:44.779
Jamie is taking precautions.

16:44.780 --> 16:46.714
These things are called
straw wattles.

16:46.715 --> 16:48.949
Normally they're used
for preventing erosion.

16:48.950 --> 16:50.751
We're not gonna use them
for that.

16:51.887 --> 16:53.721
We're gonna use them
as barriers

16:53.722 --> 16:55.322
Along the side of our slide

16:55.323 --> 16:59.827
To help prevent us from going
someplace we don't want to go.

16:59.828 --> 17:01.562
Jamie, that looks hilarious.

17:01.563 --> 17:05.199
With the wattle
safety system secure,

17:05.200 --> 17:06.934
They focus on comfort,

17:06.935 --> 17:09.603
Cushioning the entire slide
with carpet.

17:11.673 --> 17:12.973
Oop.

17:14.976 --> 17:16.644
Ooh.

17:16.645 --> 17:19.579
Whoo!

17:21.983 --> 17:26.119
Can I get
another roll of duct tape?

17:26.121 --> 17:28.422
And then it's time
for the last ingredient

17:28.423 --> 17:32.059
Of any slippery dip --
lacquered vinyl.

17:32.060 --> 17:33.594
Never let it be said

17:33.595 --> 17:37.398
That "Mythbusters" doesn't roll
out at least the orange carpet.

17:38.467 --> 17:40.468
Come on.
All the way, buddy.

17:42.904 --> 17:44.805
Yep, roll it out.

17:44.806 --> 17:47.942
But we may have a few problems
holding on to it.

17:50.579 --> 17:51.912
Oh, well.

17:51.913 --> 17:54.515
You should hop off the
carpet, please. Yep.

17:55.684 --> 17:57.985
It's like it's slippery.

18:00.021 --> 18:01.021
Ho ho!

18:01.022 --> 18:03.657
There we go.
Okay.

18:05.360 --> 18:09.029
I'm not only having fun,
I'm finding if there's any spots

18:09.030 --> 18:10.731
That are sticking up
that can hurt us.

18:10.732 --> 18:12.500
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

18:12.501 --> 18:14.335
I think the answer is no.

18:15.403 --> 18:17.671
And there you have it --

18:17.672 --> 18:22.543
After two days of back-breaking,
earth-moving, soil-smoothing,

18:22.544 --> 18:24.912
Plywood-plaquing,
wattle-waddling,

18:24.913 --> 18:27.414
Carpet-laying,
and vinyl-veneering --

18:27.415 --> 18:33.320
One massive made-to-order
"Mythbusters" water slide.

18:33.321 --> 18:35.222
Well, sir, that is a ramp.

18:35.223 --> 18:36.323
Yes, it is.

18:36.324 --> 18:38.392
What's standing between us
and testing it?

18:38.393 --> 18:39.827
A commercial break?

18:39.828 --> 18:41.562
Oh.
See you in a few minutes.

18:47.447 --> 18:50.244
Can canny
delivery companies save fuel

18:50.245 --> 18:54.181
By turning only right
and eliminating the lights?

18:54.182 --> 18:55.649
So far for cars,

18:55.650 --> 18:57.351
It looks like it doesn't make
that much of a difference

18:57.352 --> 18:59.353
If you're making a left-hand
turn or a right-hand turn.

18:59.354 --> 19:01.321
But, I mean,
is that true for trucks?

19:01.322 --> 19:03.390
Is this company
just wasting their time?

19:03.391 --> 19:06.193
I think we definitely need
to step up to trucks next.

19:06.194 --> 19:08.729
I mean, a big truck
takes longer to accelerate,

19:08.730 --> 19:10.764
Which means it needs
a bigger break in traffic

19:10.765 --> 19:12.733
In order to complete
a left-hand turn.

19:12.734 --> 19:15.669
Plus, they're likely
using more fuel while idling.

19:15.670 --> 19:16.870
Yeah, and in the real world,

19:16.871 --> 19:18.438
Not only do they have
to deal with traffic,

19:18.439 --> 19:20.641
Narrow roads, steep hills,
pedestrians, and --

19:20.642 --> 19:22.643
That sounds a little like
San Francisco.

19:22.644 --> 19:24.278
I say we get trucking.

19:25.446 --> 19:27.915
The Mythbusters courier service

19:27.916 --> 19:30.450
Is ready to deliver
for this myth.

19:31.586 --> 19:33.187
This is the truck
that we are gonna be using

19:33.188 --> 19:34.555
To make our deliveries.

19:34.556 --> 19:37.191
We have created
the Mythbusters courier service.

19:37.192 --> 19:38.759
We aim to please.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.661
But there's more.
Come with me.

19:40.662 --> 19:42.930
We will be making
several deliveries

19:42.931 --> 19:44.631
To our favorite vendors.

19:44.632 --> 19:48.101
And inside our packages
are "Mythbusters" t-shirts.

19:48.102 --> 19:49.136
More importantly, though,

19:49.137 --> 19:50.771
Our truck is outfitted
with a fuel cell

19:50.772 --> 19:52.739
That we'll be measuring
before and after each run

19:52.740 --> 19:55.809
So we find out how much fuel
we're consuming.

19:55.810 --> 19:58.111
78.75 pounds.

19:58.112 --> 20:00.147
So that is our starting
fuel weight.

20:00.148 --> 20:02.616
The best part is,
I'll be driving.

20:02.617 --> 20:04.985
Just like the car test,

20:04.986 --> 20:07.621
For this test,
they'll do two routes,

20:07.622 --> 20:10.557
Delivering to the same
six destinations.

20:10.558 --> 20:14.027
First up is the direct route,
with both lefts and rights,

20:14.028 --> 20:16.730
Covering a distance of 5.2 miles

20:16.731 --> 20:20.801
From the palace of fine arts
to Alamo square.

20:20.802 --> 20:22.803
All right, let's get
these packages delivered.

20:24.339 --> 20:26.540
All right,
zeroing out trip odometer.

20:26.541 --> 20:30.010
Start your engine
in 3...2...1...Go!

20:30.011 --> 20:32.079
All right, and here we go.

20:35.183 --> 20:37.851
All right, coming up here,

20:37.852 --> 20:40.554
You're gonna be taking a left
at the light.

20:40.555 --> 20:42.189
Oh, see?

20:42.190 --> 20:45.158
This darn light --
it's eating into our schedule.

20:45.159 --> 20:47.628
Despite the lights,
in no time at all,

20:47.629 --> 20:50.998
They've reached their first
"Mythbusters" landmark...

20:50.999 --> 20:53.200
You ready, kid?
I was born ready.

20:53.201 --> 20:55.068
...Fort Mason.

20:55.069 --> 20:56.503
Drop that package.
Got it!

20:56.504 --> 20:58.939
The delivery ninja
Springs into action,

20:58.940 --> 21:02.509
And the first package
is dropped.

21:02.510 --> 21:03.777
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

21:03.778 --> 21:05.946
We got a schedule to keep!
Okay, hit it!

21:05.947 --> 21:09.816
Oh, my God!
We're going to Lombard street!

21:09.817 --> 21:11.218
I love a challenge.

21:11.219 --> 21:13.854
That's the crookedest street
in the city, possibly the world.

21:13.855 --> 21:15.989
No, that's wall street.

21:15.990 --> 21:20.060
Yep, Lombard street has
more curves than a chorus line,

21:20.061 --> 21:23.297
And it's proving
a little difficult for mcs.

21:23.298 --> 21:24.831
Oh, crap!

21:24.832 --> 21:27.634
Oh, my God!
Oh, my gosh!

21:27.635 --> 21:29.403
We start going down
Lombard, I'm thinking to myself,

21:29.404 --> 21:31.505
"who picked this route?"
I mean, this is ridiculous.

21:31.506 --> 21:33.373
Don't worry.
We're professionals here at mcs.

21:33.374 --> 21:35.208
Watch out. It's getting tighter
and tighter.

21:35.209 --> 21:36.743
Can you make it down this?

21:39.113 --> 21:42.749
I'm almost about to crash
into the side of the wall.

21:42.750 --> 21:44.618
This is a national treasure.

21:44.619 --> 21:46.820
This is a landmark.

21:46.821 --> 21:49.222
I have to throw it into reverse.
I'm backing up.

21:49.223 --> 21:52.125
Just then, because the angle
of the truck was so steep,

21:52.126 --> 21:54.861
We lost fuel to the engine,
and the engine cut out.

21:56.497 --> 21:58.432
Oh [bleep].

21:58.433 --> 22:01.201
Aaahh! We're gonna get stuck
on Lombard!

22:01.202 --> 22:02.569
So I lose my power steering.

22:02.570 --> 22:03.970
I had to throw it in neutral

22:03.971 --> 22:07.040
And do the rest of the street
in neutral.

22:07.041 --> 22:10.344
Mcs --
we guarantee our deliveries!

22:12.547 --> 22:14.581
I didn't even think
I was gonna make it out.

22:14.582 --> 22:15.782
I'm going over the curb!

22:15.783 --> 22:17.384
You're going over the curb?!

22:17.385 --> 22:20.921
Luckily, Tory knows how
to handle a curve, even in neutral.

22:20.922 --> 22:22.422
Go!

22:22.423 --> 22:24.791
So the second delivery is made.

22:24.792 --> 22:27.394
There you go.
Package for you.

22:29.330 --> 22:31.531
And then after a little push...

22:33.201 --> 22:36.069
So crazy.

22:36.070 --> 22:39.873
...It's off to drop stop
number 3 -- north beach.

22:39.874 --> 22:41.408
Hey, ciao.

22:41.409 --> 22:44.778
This is north beach.
It's little Italy -- my people.

22:44.779 --> 22:46.279
Ciao, ciao!

22:46.280 --> 22:47.681
Hey, Vinny!

22:47.682 --> 22:49.049
Hey, let's stop and have lunch.

22:49.050 --> 22:51.451
No time for lunch, Tory.
We got to deliver a package!

22:52.553 --> 22:54.087
Once again, the cowboy courier

22:54.088 --> 22:55.956
Is in and out.

22:55.957 --> 22:58.692
Okay, go, go, go!

22:58.693 --> 23:01.495
And they head to the
"Mythbusters" butcher of choice

23:01.496 --> 23:03.096
In Chinatown.

23:03.097 --> 23:05.198
Little city meats, here we come.

23:08.302 --> 23:09.770
As I'm driving this route,

23:09.771 --> 23:11.538
I'm starting to see
that left-hand turns

23:11.539 --> 23:13.640
Are a lot more annoying
than right-hand turns.

23:13.641 --> 23:15.942
I mean, you got to wait
for the traffic to clear up

23:15.943 --> 23:17.244
Before you can even go.

23:17.245 --> 23:19.212
Yep, so far this test,

23:19.213 --> 23:20.914
They've spent over five minutes

23:20.915 --> 23:23.350
Just idling at traffic lights.

23:23.351 --> 23:25.752
Look out,
people on the cable car,

23:25.753 --> 23:27.854
Mcs is coming through!

23:27.855 --> 23:31.758
Oh, my God.
This is such a hard left.

23:31.759 --> 23:33.960
Come on!
Go, go, go!

23:33.961 --> 23:36.463
We got to get
these packages delivered!

23:37.665 --> 23:39.699
All right, Grant,
this is your drop! Get it!

23:39.700 --> 23:42.235
Go, go, go, go!

23:42.236 --> 23:44.738
Hi.
I have a delivery for you.

23:44.739 --> 23:46.840
That's five packages delivered,

23:46.841 --> 23:51.178
With one final stop to make --
Alamo square.

23:51.179 --> 23:53.647
This is it!
This is the last package!

23:53.648 --> 23:55.015
Yeah!

23:55.016 --> 23:57.818
We did it!
Nice work, you guys.

23:57.819 --> 23:59.486
Package from the Mythbusters.

23:59.487 --> 24:00.587
Thank you.

24:00.588 --> 24:01.755
That's it.
Yes!

24:01.756 --> 24:02.923
We're done.

24:02.924 --> 24:05.692
Customer satisfaction
guaranteed.

24:05.693 --> 24:07.160
That's mcs.

24:07.161 --> 24:09.329
So, left-hand turns --
pretty hairy, huh?

24:09.330 --> 24:11.531
Yeah, and now we got
to measure the fuel,

24:11.532 --> 24:15.101
Get onto the right-hand route,
and do this all again.

24:15.102 --> 24:17.637
So we have 71.95 pounds.

24:17.638 --> 24:23.677
Okay, that gives us a total
of 6.8 pounds consumed.

24:23.678 --> 24:27.380
We went 5.2 miles
in 52 minutes.

24:27.381 --> 24:28.849
Yeah! Nice!

24:28.850 --> 24:31.918
That felt like we went
like 100 miles.

24:31.919 --> 24:33.987
In about five hours.

24:33.988 --> 24:36.590
After driving
our left-heavy route,

24:36.591 --> 24:40.293
I feel like our results
might be extremely interesting

24:40.294 --> 24:41.428
For this experiment.

24:41.429 --> 24:43.730
'cause if you think about
the amount of time

24:43.731 --> 24:46.633
That we had to idle at lights
before we could turn left,

24:46.634 --> 24:48.869
I think it's about
the same amount of time

24:48.870 --> 24:51.238
It would take three rights
to get to a left.

24:51.239 --> 24:53.840
I think we might actually have
the opposite result

24:53.841 --> 24:55.642
Of our previous experiment.

24:55.643 --> 24:58.512
I think we might actually
save fuel going right.

25:00.598 --> 25:02.666
Don't try anything you see
on the show at home.

25:02.667 --> 25:05.102
We're what you call
"experts."

25:07.920 --> 25:08.920
Welcome back.

25:08.921 --> 25:10.321
We are testing

25:10.322 --> 25:12.390
Pretty much everything
we can see in this clip.

25:15.494 --> 25:18.696
So we came out here to pit 232
and built ourselves

25:18.697 --> 25:21.399
A full-size ramp,
which we are about to test.

25:21.400 --> 25:22.667
If you'll excuse me,

25:22.668 --> 25:25.370
I'm gonna get suited up
for the first slide.

25:25.371 --> 25:29.407
While Adam slips into
something more uncomfortable,

25:29.408 --> 25:33.745
Here's Jamie with the stats
on the superslide.

25:33.746 --> 25:35.446
Our slide is 165 feet long.

25:35.447 --> 25:38.750
As we go down it, we'll be going
at a 24-degree angle.

25:38.751 --> 25:40.551
As we come off the end of it,

25:40.552 --> 25:43.087
We're gonna be going
at a 30-degree angle.

25:43.088 --> 25:45.456
How far we go
and how fast we travel --

25:45.457 --> 25:47.458
That's what we're here
to find out.

25:47.459 --> 25:50.762
And they'll coat the slide
with the same slippery solution

25:50.763 --> 25:52.730
As the small scale.

25:52.731 --> 25:55.500
We're using soap and water
to lubricate things,

25:55.501 --> 25:56.634
Make us go faster.

25:56.635 --> 25:58.136
Jamie's sorted out the lube,

25:58.137 --> 26:00.838
And Adam's suited up.

26:00.839 --> 26:05.343
Adam, I've got
this handy-dandy GPS unit

26:05.344 --> 26:07.845
I'd like to put on you
so we can track your speed.

26:07.846 --> 26:12.850
Fantastic.
I can put it right...There.

26:12.851 --> 26:14.318
Ready.

26:14.319 --> 26:17.488
The GPS unit will track
not only Adam's speed,

26:17.489 --> 26:19.323
But also the distance he flies

26:19.324 --> 26:21.292
From the mega "Mythbusters"
slide.

26:21.293 --> 26:24.028
While it would be
tempting to just go for it

26:24.029 --> 26:25.830
And start from the top,

26:25.831 --> 26:27.298
We're gonna start
from the middle,

26:27.299 --> 26:29.267
Because we kind of need
to work our way into this.

26:29.268 --> 26:30.635
I'm not actually nervous.

26:30.636 --> 26:34.272
I'm...Itching to get on
this slide!

26:34.273 --> 26:35.306
This is a prototype.

26:35.307 --> 26:36.674
We don't know
what it's gonna do.

26:36.675 --> 26:38.476
I'm dying to try this out!

26:38.477 --> 26:41.079
We're gonna ease into it,
and everything seems okay.

26:41.080 --> 26:42.380
Then we'll go for it.

26:42.381 --> 26:44.615
I just can't wait.

26:44.616 --> 26:47.385
Here we go!
Test number 1!

26:47.386 --> 26:50.121
Adam "danger" savage
empties his bucket

26:50.122 --> 26:53.558
And adopts the downhill-luge
position of the video.

26:55.761 --> 26:57.762
Whoo! Whoo!

26:59.998 --> 27:01.766
Oh, yes!

27:03.402 --> 27:05.470
I'm okay.

27:07.239 --> 27:09.407
Not very far.

27:09.408 --> 27:13.878
That undignified dismount
wasn't quite the slide Adam expected.

27:13.879 --> 27:17.415
Whoo!

27:17.416 --> 27:19.917
With only half a slope
to build momentum,

27:19.918 --> 27:23.287
He peaked
at 15 miles per hour...

27:23.288 --> 27:26.724
And traveled a measly 4 feet.

27:26.725 --> 27:28.759
You barely made it off
the end of the ramp.

27:28.760 --> 27:29.994
I don't know what happened.

27:29.995 --> 27:31.429
I was good and slippery,

27:31.430 --> 27:34.232
And the track did a great job
of keeping me on the track,

27:34.233 --> 27:36.968
But I landed about 4 feet away.

27:36.969 --> 27:38.302
That's not a good sign.

27:38.303 --> 27:40.571
No, it's not a good sign
for the myth,

27:40.572 --> 27:42.206
But I'm raring to go again.

27:42.207 --> 27:43.975
That was a hell of a lot
of fun.

27:43.976 --> 27:47.545
And for take 2,
he'll need a little more slide,

27:47.546 --> 27:49.881
So he heads to three-quarters
of the way up.

27:51.216 --> 27:53.551
Whoo!

27:53.552 --> 27:54.652
Aah!

27:54.653 --> 27:56.287
Aah!

27:57.222 --> 27:59.924
The landing y have been
a little hard on his derriÃ¨re...

27:59.925 --> 28:01.192
Whoo!

28:01.193 --> 28:03.628
...But at least Adam got in.

28:05.998 --> 28:07.965
Oh, wow.

28:07.966 --> 28:10.067
But there was
one frothy problem.

28:10.068 --> 28:11.636
Whoo!

28:11.637 --> 28:14.739
Aah! Aah!

28:14.740 --> 28:16.440
By the time I hit the ramp,

28:16.441 --> 28:20.278
So much water had sprayed into
my face from the overly wet ramp

28:20.279 --> 28:21.712
That I couldn't see a thing.

28:21.713 --> 28:22.847
I hit the ramp blind.

28:22.848 --> 28:25.583
Aah!

28:25.584 --> 28:27.852
I did everything wrong.

28:27.853 --> 28:29.053
Aah!

28:29.054 --> 28:31.355
But I landed okay.

28:31.356 --> 28:32.990
Coach, I'm ready to go in
for another run.

28:32.991 --> 28:34.225
Will you send me in?

28:34.226 --> 28:36.594
Okay,
but to be safe for this run,

28:36.595 --> 28:37.995
They ditch the bucket

28:37.996 --> 28:42.166
And give the slide a more even
spray from top to bottom.

28:42.167 --> 28:43.434
If you remember, I told Jamie

28:43.435 --> 28:45.036
That I thought the sprayers
were a stupid idea,

28:45.037 --> 28:47.438
And I was so sure we weren't gonna
use them to grease the ramp

28:47.439 --> 28:49.707
That I told him
that if we did use them,

28:49.708 --> 28:52.343
I'd pay him $100.

28:52.344 --> 28:54.512
I hope he forgets.

28:54.513 --> 28:58.216
I doubt it, Adam.
The Hyneman never forgets.

28:58.217 --> 29:00.117
With the safety sorted out,

29:00.118 --> 29:02.386
The guys can concentrate
on this myth.

29:02.387 --> 29:04.755
There are two parts
to the superslide --

29:04.756 --> 29:07.091
Accuracy and distance.

29:07.092 --> 29:09.293
So first they're taking on...

29:09.294 --> 29:10.294
Distance.

29:10.295 --> 29:11.662
By our best calculations,

29:11.663 --> 29:16.867
The slider in the video
flies approximately 115 feet.

29:16.868 --> 29:19.270
Do I have 115 feet of travel
in my future?

29:19.271 --> 29:20.938
Honestly, I don't think.

29:22.474 --> 29:24.775
Okay,
I'm ready to go from the top.

29:24.776 --> 29:27.612
It should be all downhill
from here.

29:27.613 --> 29:29.513
Yeah, well, break a leg.

29:29.514 --> 29:30.948
Here I go.

29:30.949 --> 29:34.452
But will a slide from the very
top be enough to launch Adam

29:34.453 --> 29:37.855
The same distance
as the video stunt slider?

29:37.856 --> 29:40.291
3...2...1.

29:40.292 --> 29:42.326
Oh, it doesn't take much.
Here we go.

29:42.327 --> 29:44.295
Whoa!

29:46.164 --> 29:47.632
Whoa!

29:47.633 --> 29:50.234
Aaaaaah!

29:52.938 --> 29:54.972
Whoo!

29:54.973 --> 29:57.341
Yeah!

29:57.342 --> 30:00.244
Wow!

30:00.245 --> 30:01.479
Whoo!

30:02.914 --> 30:05.650
Well, that was one
mighty mega whoosh.

30:05.651 --> 30:08.419
Aaaaaah!

30:08.420 --> 30:10.988
But Adam only flew 70 feet...

30:10.989 --> 30:12.323
Aaaah!

30:12.324 --> 30:15.793
...A far cry
from the 115 feet of the myth.

30:15.794 --> 30:17.728
I'm alive, right?

30:17.729 --> 30:19.163
I think so.

30:19.164 --> 30:20.598
How far did I fly?

30:20.599 --> 30:22.366
You flew about 70 feet.

30:22.367 --> 30:24.035
Aaaaaah!

30:24.036 --> 30:25.069
That's totally intense.

30:29.007 --> 30:31.108
That went above and beyond
everything else.

30:31.109 --> 30:33.911
The single most intense thing
I've ever done on the show.

30:33.912 --> 30:35.680
Editors,
just roll it one more time.

30:35.681 --> 30:37.315
I want to watch this.

30:37.316 --> 30:39.216
Yeah, look at that!

30:40.619 --> 30:43.287
I'm screaming involuntarily
the whole way to the water.

30:43.288 --> 30:46.590
The moment I feel the water hit
my feet, I am so grateful,

30:46.591 --> 30:48.392
'cause I know
it's a good landing.

30:49.761 --> 30:51.095
I wish you could try this.

30:51.096 --> 30:54.598
Well, we can't,
but the Hyneman can...

30:54.599 --> 30:58.569
And maybe he'll be able to go
the extra distance

30:58.570 --> 31:00.071
This myth requires.

31:00.072 --> 31:01.806
Aaaaah!

31:04.876 --> 31:07.011
Whoo!

31:07.012 --> 31:08.045
Next up...

31:08.046 --> 31:09.347
Keep off walls.

31:09.348 --> 31:11.415
...The Mythbusters deliver

31:11.416 --> 31:13.551
And set their route to rights.

31:13.552 --> 31:15.786
Hey, don't forget to use mcs!

31:15.787 --> 31:16.854
We're the bomb!

31:20.806 --> 31:22.406
Is it a bird?

31:22.407 --> 31:23.407
Whoo!

31:23.408 --> 31:24.508
Is it a plane?

31:26.478 --> 31:30.481
No, it's Adam "danger" savage,

31:30.482 --> 31:32.650
Trying to re-create this.

31:35.053 --> 31:38.723
But now it's time to call in
the heavies.

31:38.724 --> 31:42.426
So, why do I have to go down
the slide when Adam already has?

31:42.427 --> 31:44.395
Good to go.

31:44.396 --> 31:46.764
Well, you don't think I'm gonna pass
something like this up, do you?

31:46.765 --> 31:48.766
I mean, look at it.

31:48.767 --> 31:51.135
And, besides, who knows?
I might go further.

31:51.136 --> 31:53.804
It isn't a case
of "anything Adam can do,

31:53.805 --> 31:55.673
Jamie can do better."

31:55.674 --> 31:59.610
Just relax and clench your butt.
That worked for me so well.

31:59.611 --> 32:01.212
It's about mass.

32:01.213 --> 32:03.447
Jamie is slightly heavier
than Adam,

32:03.448 --> 32:05.216
And that could give him an edge

32:05.217 --> 32:07.251
When it comes
to flight distance.

32:07.252 --> 32:10.021
Don't you wonder what's going
through Jamie's head right now?

32:10.022 --> 32:13.057
"keep my core tight, relax."

32:13.058 --> 32:14.225
It's probably not.

32:14.226 --> 32:15.693
It's probably more like,

32:15.694 --> 32:19.497
"I wonder how to reassemble
the rack on my truck.

32:19.498 --> 32:21.232
"maybe some quarter-20 bolts.

32:21.233 --> 32:24.001
Oh, it's time to go?
Okay. Here we go."

32:25.337 --> 32:29.307
So, Adam, this whole thing seems
kind of fun,

32:29.308 --> 32:31.809
But it's also terrifying.

32:31.810 --> 32:34.245
Maybe it's terrifyingly fun.
What do you think?

32:34.246 --> 32:38.416
Yeah. Exactly the
same assessment of the thing.

32:38.417 --> 32:40.484
Tell me what you feel like
after the fly.

32:40.485 --> 32:42.386
I guess it's now or never.

32:42.387 --> 32:43.587
Here we go.

32:43.588 --> 32:45.556
Jamie starts
at the safety distance

32:45.557 --> 32:47.091
Three-quarters of the way up.

32:47.092 --> 32:49.460
Whoa!

32:54.566 --> 32:55.533
Perfect!

32:55.534 --> 32:57.168
Whoa!

32:57.169 --> 33:01.639
You sounded great going down --
"w-w-whoa!"

33:01.640 --> 33:03.741
It is kind of involuntary.

33:03.742 --> 33:04.742
Whoa!

33:04.743 --> 33:06.243
Do you see what I mean about,

33:06.244 --> 33:10.314
Like, not having much of
a choice, how things are going?

33:10.315 --> 33:13.117
I didn't keep my legs quite
as spread as you were,

33:13.118 --> 33:16.420
Which was part of the reason
I came off just a hair sideways.

33:16.421 --> 33:18.622
Yeah.

33:18.623 --> 33:20.858
That's kind of painful
coming down.

33:20.859 --> 33:23.561
If you're not centered,
that's a lot of hit.

33:23.562 --> 33:26.130
Yeah, when I landed
on my butt --

33:26.131 --> 33:28.032
I'm still sore from that.

33:28.033 --> 33:30.301
Aaaaah!

33:30.302 --> 33:35.306
With Jamie's safety run
complete, he heads for the top.

33:35.307 --> 33:39.443
Just look at this thing.
I mean, who gets to do this?

33:39.444 --> 33:41.145
This is fun.

33:41.146 --> 33:42.713
Fun,

33:42.714 --> 33:47.518
But will he be able to fly
the full 115 feet of the myth?

33:47.519 --> 33:49.587
From the top.

33:49.588 --> 33:53.224
3...2...1.

33:59.765 --> 34:01.332
Oh!

34:04.269 --> 34:05.803
He's okay.

34:05.804 --> 34:08.438
That landing
was a little cattywampus.

34:08.440 --> 34:10.841
Jamie made quite a splash...

34:10.842 --> 34:13.844
Because according to the GPS,

34:13.844 --> 34:16.414
He peaked at 30 miles per hour

34:16.415 --> 34:20.784
And achieved
the furthest flight yet.

34:20.786 --> 34:22.753
I just went
30 miles an hour down the ramp,

34:22.754 --> 34:25.089
And I flew 72 feet.

34:25.090 --> 34:26.223
Oh!

34:26.224 --> 34:28.292
Now, we know,
looking at the video,

34:28.293 --> 34:31.695
That the guy had
to have traveled about 115 feet.

34:31.696 --> 34:34.498
And backing out from there,
doing the math,

34:34.498 --> 34:37.001
That tells us
that he had to be going

34:37.002 --> 34:39.904
About 40 to 45 miles an hour
through the air.

34:39.905 --> 34:42.039
Not looking good for the myth.

34:42.040 --> 34:46.409
Yep, the mythical
115 feet is impossible to match,

34:46.411 --> 34:50.815
So next they'll focus on
part 2 -- accuracy.

34:52.784 --> 34:54.318
So, you flew 72 feet
on that run.

34:54.319 --> 34:55.319
I beat you.

34:55.320 --> 34:56.754
By 2 feet.

34:56.755 --> 34:58.255
Yes!

34:58.256 --> 35:01.125
But now that leads to the
natural question of accuracy.

35:01.126 --> 35:02.560
If we did this on dry land,

35:02.561 --> 35:04.462
Could we place the pool
somewhere

35:04.463 --> 35:06.530
Where we'd hit it every time
and survive?

35:06.531 --> 35:07.965
We can arrange that.

35:07.966 --> 35:09.266
Can I be the one to do it?

35:09.267 --> 35:10.835
Can I be the one to run the
test? Please, please, please?

35:10.836 --> 35:15.072
Well, with all this enthusiasm,
I suppose so.

35:15.073 --> 35:17.141
Excellent. Excellent.
I'll suit up.

35:20.545 --> 35:22.746
Here you go.
Package for you.

35:22.747 --> 35:25.082
Our trucking trio
are testing the myth

35:25.083 --> 35:27.918
That you can save gas
by only turning right.

35:27.919 --> 35:29.587
Come on!
Go, go, go!

35:29.588 --> 35:30.788
We got packages!

35:30.789 --> 35:33.257
For their left-turn
delivery route,

35:33.258 --> 35:35.860
They used 6.8 pounds of gas.

35:35.861 --> 35:38.896
But will that change
for the right route?

35:38.897 --> 35:41.365
Okay, now it's time
for the right-hand route.

35:41.366 --> 35:42.700
To keep this scientific,

35:42.701 --> 35:44.802
We're driving
at the same time of day

35:44.803 --> 35:46.270
With the same driving style

35:46.271 --> 35:48.973
And going to the same
six destinations.

35:48.974 --> 35:51.809
Just as before,
they weigh the fuel cell.

35:51.810 --> 35:54.912
All right, 76.9.

35:54.913 --> 35:55.980
Start the right-hand route.

35:55.981 --> 35:57.281
All right.
Cool.

35:57.282 --> 36:00.484
And then it's time
to start the engines.

36:00.485 --> 36:01.986
Let's do this.

36:05.023 --> 36:08.459
Six packages
and using nothing but rights.

36:08.460 --> 36:09.760
This should be interesting.

36:09.761 --> 36:11.262
It should.

36:11.263 --> 36:14.632
For this route, they'll deliver
to the same six destinations.

36:14.633 --> 36:16.233
But where there were lefts,

36:16.234 --> 36:18.669
They'll make three right turns
instead,

36:18.670 --> 36:22.506
Meaning they'll cover
a total distance of 6.8 miles --

36:22.507 --> 36:25.009
20% further than the last test.

36:25.010 --> 36:26.610
Okay, fort Mason Gate.

36:26.611 --> 36:28.546
Grant,
you ready for this delivery?

36:28.547 --> 36:30.080
It's your first one.

36:30.081 --> 36:31.248
All right, I'm gonna pull over.

36:31.249 --> 36:32.650
You jump and deliver
that package.

36:32.651 --> 36:34.118
Go, go!

36:34.119 --> 36:37.721
Once again, a fast-and-furious
Grant delivers the goods.

36:37.722 --> 36:38.856
Go, go, go, go!

36:38.857 --> 36:41.525
You can make it, Grant!
You can make it!

36:43.261 --> 36:45.029
And Tory is on the right course.

36:45.030 --> 36:47.932
Seems like we're traveling
over a lot more distance

36:47.933 --> 36:49.033
With this route.

36:49.034 --> 36:50.868
Yeah, but we're not waiting
at lights.

36:50.869 --> 36:52.169
Grant's right.

36:52.170 --> 36:53.737
They're not hanging around
for this test,

36:53.738 --> 36:56.607
And they're already at
their second location.

36:56.608 --> 37:01.412
But will the lack of lights yet
extra distance save them fuel?

37:01.413 --> 37:04.982
All right, so, this is Lombard.

37:04.983 --> 37:07.117
Lombard.
Get ready.

37:07.118 --> 37:08.919
Keep off walls.

37:08.920 --> 37:12.890
Their last Lombard run
was a little sticky.

37:12.891 --> 37:14.558
Oh [bleep]

37:14.559 --> 37:15.759
Looking good.

37:15.760 --> 37:17.895
So this time, to even the odds,

37:17.896 --> 37:19.863
Tory cruises down in neutral

37:19.864 --> 37:22.666
And restarts the engine
at the bottom of the hill

37:22.667 --> 37:25.736
To mimic the same fuel
consumption as before.

37:25.737 --> 37:28.339
Okay, go, go, go, go, go!

37:28.340 --> 37:30.174
Are you a fan of "Mythbusters"?
Yeah.

37:30.175 --> 37:32.309
Here you go. There's a package
delivered for you.

37:32.310 --> 37:33.344
Thank you.

37:33.345 --> 37:35.879
That's one happy fan.

37:35.880 --> 37:38.515
So, it's on to little Italy...

37:38.516 --> 37:40.217
Ciao, ciao!

37:40.218 --> 37:42.253
All right.

37:42.254 --> 37:43.921
Okay, go, go, go!

37:43.922 --> 37:46.156
Did you get a signature?

37:46.157 --> 37:48.092
...And then Chinatown.

37:48.093 --> 37:51.795
It's the belly of the beast --
Chinatown.

37:51.796 --> 37:54.832
Come on! Get back here!
Come on, son.

37:54.833 --> 37:57.301
He's faster than I remember.

37:57.302 --> 38:00.604
That's four packages down
with only two to go.

38:00.605 --> 38:03.274
Who knew packages
could be so exciting?

38:05.577 --> 38:07.511
Should we leave him this time?

38:07.512 --> 38:08.712
Nah, we got one more package
still.

38:08.713 --> 38:09.947
I don't want to get out
of the car.

38:09.948 --> 38:10.948
Do you?
No.

38:10.949 --> 38:13.083
And for the final delivery,

38:13.084 --> 38:16.887
There's just one more set of
rights to get to Alamo square.

38:16.888 --> 38:18.088
All right, here we go.

38:18.089 --> 38:19.290
Last delivery.

38:19.291 --> 38:21.859
It sure would be easier
if we could take a left.

38:21.860 --> 38:24.461
Sure would.
And now they're at Alamo square,

38:24.462 --> 38:26.230
They're done "right"
by the route.

38:26.231 --> 38:29.433
But has going the extra distance
saved them gas?

38:31.069 --> 38:33.470
Good enough!
Let's weigh the fuel cell!

38:33.471 --> 38:37.541
All right, 72.9 pounds.

38:37.542 --> 38:41.879
That means we consumed
2.8 pounds less

38:41.880 --> 38:43.414
On the right-hand route.

38:43.415 --> 38:44.415
So it's confirmed.

38:44.416 --> 38:46.083
It actually saved you fuel

38:46.084 --> 38:47.685
To do do right turns only?

38:47.686 --> 38:49.620
Surprisingly enough,

38:49.621 --> 38:51.355
Although the right-hand route

38:51.356 --> 38:54.191
Added nine minutes
to their total delivery time,

38:54.192 --> 38:56.794
It was more fuel-efficient.

38:56.795 --> 38:59.963
The results for this experiment
are really, really interesting.

38:59.964 --> 39:02.599
The left-hand route was shorter,
it took less time,

39:02.600 --> 39:05.269
But it consumed a lot more fuel.

39:05.270 --> 39:06.704
So this myth is confirmed.

39:06.705 --> 39:09.273
If you're a delivery-truck
driver in an urban environment,

39:09.274 --> 39:12.309
You're definitely gonna want
to plan a right-hand route.

39:12.310 --> 39:16.580
But if you're me in a little,
tiny car, not very practical.

39:19.517 --> 39:22.453
Up next, it's Adam's accuracy...

39:22.454 --> 39:24.755
From here, the ring looks like
the size of a quarter.

39:24.756 --> 39:27.157
...As he rings in
the water-slide wipeout.

39:27.158 --> 39:29.793
Aaaaah!

39:35.810 --> 39:38.812
Water slides --
they're wet-and-wild fun.

39:38.813 --> 39:43.117
But could the science of this
splash landing be misleading?

39:44.719 --> 39:48.155
A flight of 115 feet is busted.

39:48.156 --> 39:51.058
So now it's all down
to accuracy.

39:52.427 --> 39:55.663
To me, the soul of this
myth boils down to accuracy.

39:55.664 --> 39:58.399
Is the slider going to hit
the same location repeatedly?

39:58.400 --> 39:59.934
And, thus, can they place a pool

39:59.935 --> 40:02.136
In the middle of a grassy field
and hit it,

40:02.137 --> 40:03.470
Thus saving their lives?

40:03.471 --> 40:06.006
Okay, so from everything
we've done so far,

40:06.007 --> 40:08.475
We've calculated
that we're hitting a spot

40:08.476 --> 40:10.978
That's pretty much in the center
of that circle behind me.

40:10.979 --> 40:13.547
But here's how I want you
to think about this.

40:13.548 --> 40:15.182
Picture that that is dry land,

40:15.183 --> 40:18.352
And the only salvation you have
at the end of that dry land

40:18.353 --> 40:20.988
Is that circle, which is full
of lifesaving water,

40:20.989 --> 40:23.190
Somewhere in the middle
of the dry land,

40:23.191 --> 40:26.260
And you are going to trust your
life to hitting that target.

40:26.261 --> 40:29.263
I would not.

40:29.264 --> 40:31.098
I personally am really glad

40:31.099 --> 40:34.435
That the whole thing
is surrounded by water.

40:34.436 --> 40:37.705
I just can't give it 100%
that I'm gonna hit it.

40:37.706 --> 40:39.473
I'm gonna try and hit it.
Are you ready?

40:39.474 --> 40:42.509
I'm ready.
Go for the gold star.

40:42.510 --> 40:44.745
Dude, I wish you could see it
from here.

40:44.746 --> 40:47.548
From here, the ring looks like
the size of a quarter.

40:47.549 --> 40:49.917
Well, then, you shouldn't have
any trouble hitting it.

40:49.918 --> 40:52.319
Okay.

40:52.320 --> 40:54.688
It all comes down to this --

40:54.689 --> 40:59.560
One souped-up superslider
and one floatin' ring of rubber.

40:59.561 --> 41:03.897
Will Adam be accurate enough
to ring in this myth?

41:03.898 --> 41:07.901
In 3...2...1!

41:15.777 --> 41:19.146
Yeah!

41:19.147 --> 41:21.081
Yeah!

41:21.082 --> 41:25.119
That was a perfect
splash landing.

41:25.120 --> 41:28.022
Dude, I didn't even break it!

41:28.023 --> 41:30.891
Adam's final run propelled him
70 feet

41:30.892 --> 41:36.964
And then directly into the
center of the pseudo-kiddy pool.

41:36.965 --> 41:38.932
I don't think this
is really gonna take off

41:38.933 --> 41:40.567
As an amusement-park ride,
though.

41:42.937 --> 41:45.806
It's a little intense
for the kids.

41:49.177 --> 41:50.878
Well done.

41:50.879 --> 41:52.546
Thank you.

41:54.249 --> 41:57.117
I am gobsmacked
that that worked so well.

41:58.620 --> 42:01.155
So, Adam's accuracy
was actually pretty good.

42:04.426 --> 42:06.026
But let's remember
that in the clip,

42:06.027 --> 42:09.830
The pool was about 115 feet away
from the end of the ramp.

42:09.831 --> 42:14.168
And that means that if what happened
here happened in that clip,

42:14.169 --> 42:17.805
That guy would be splat
about in the middle of the run.

42:17.806 --> 42:19.440
Not a good thing.

42:19.441 --> 42:20.841
Not a good thing.

42:20.842 --> 42:24.812
But where does that leave
this mega-whoosh myth?

42:24.813 --> 42:27.247
Well, as far as the distance
goes, it's busted,

42:27.248 --> 42:29.049
Because we'd have
to have a slide

42:29.050 --> 42:31.685
At least twice as long as this
to get that 115 feet.

42:31.686 --> 42:32.820
But accuracy --

42:32.821 --> 42:34.354
The plausibility
of the accuracy

42:34.355 --> 42:36.523
Is the thing I find
most astounding in this.

42:36.524 --> 42:39.159
When we started testing this,
I would have never called

42:39.160 --> 42:41.729
That we'd be reliably hitting
that dot time and again,

42:41.730 --> 42:43.997
That you could somehow
set this up on dry land

42:43.998 --> 42:45.899
And actually hit the target.

42:45.900 --> 42:47.701
Well, for the myth to be true,
both halves have to be true,

42:47.702 --> 42:49.069
And they're not,
so it's busted.

42:49.070 --> 42:52.206
That's awfully technical of you,
but, okay, I'll buy that.

42:52.207 --> 42:53.240
It's busted.

42:53.241 --> 42:55.042
So, where's my 100 bucks?

42:56.544 --> 42:59.413
I got to say,
that was the most intense thing

42:59.414 --> 43:00.948
I've ever done on this show.

43:00.949 --> 43:04.051
Yeah, well, while we were
busting this myth in the field,

43:04.052 --> 43:06.019
Our researchers
were busting it in cyberspace.

43:06.020 --> 43:07.187
How so?

43:07.188 --> 43:09.289
They contacted the people
that made the clip,

43:09.290 --> 43:10.424
And you know what?

43:10.425 --> 43:11.759
It was c.G.

43:13.528 --> 43:14.728
Double-plus busted!

43:14.729 --> 43:15.828
Busted.

43:15.829 --> 43:19.797
