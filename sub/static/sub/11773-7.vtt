WEBVTT

00:06.800 --> 00:08.767
( theme music playing )

00:15.900 --> 00:17.400
Larry:
YOU SEE? YOU SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

00:17.433 --> 00:19.767
SEE, LOOK AT THAT.
IT JUMPS AND THEN
IT FREEZES.

00:19.800 --> 00:21.367
- IT'S FRUSTRATING.
- IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING.

00:21.400 --> 00:24.533
- I'M MISSING
ALL MY SHOWS-- "LOST."
- OH, LAST WEEK--

00:24.567 --> 00:26.433
YOU KNOW THAT
GUY THEY KILLED OFF
THE PREVIOUS WEEK?

00:26.467 --> 00:28.167
ALL RIGHT,
DON'T TELL ME.
I DON'T WANNA KNOW.

00:28.200 --> 00:30.600
HE'S NOT DEAD,
HE'S BACK. HE CAME BACK.

00:30.633 --> 00:32.733
- I JUST TOLD YOU
NOT TO TELL ME.
- SHOCKING.

00:32.767 --> 00:35.333
- ARE YOU NUTS?
- ONE OF MY TOP FIVE
EPISODES OF ALL TIME.

00:35.367 --> 00:37.333
BY THE WAY,
HOW COME YOU DIDN'T
SHOW UP LAST THURSDAY?

00:37.367 --> 00:40.133
- YOU DIDN'T EVEN CALL.
- WE HAD A LOT OF APPOINTMENTS
LAST THURSDAY.

00:40.167 --> 00:42.933
- SO WHAT ABOUT THE TV?
- WELL, I DON'T THINK
IT'S YOUR TIVO.

00:42.967 --> 00:45.000
IT'S PROBABLY
THE SATELLITE,

00:45.033 --> 00:47.333
- BUT I'M GONNA
TAKE A LOOK.
- SATELLITE? OKAY.

01:04.067 --> 01:06.067
( phone ringing )

01:06.067 --> 01:07.667
YOU KNOW, IT JUST GETS
A LITTLE FRUSTRATING.

01:07.700 --> 01:09.533
EVERY TIME I SIT
DOWN AND WATCH IT,
IT'S NOT WORKING.

01:09.567 --> 01:11.133
- HELLO?
- LARRY!

01:11.167 --> 01:12.667
- Oh, hey, honey.
- OH MY GOD.

01:12.700 --> 01:14.767
HONEY, YOU COULDN'T CALL
AT A WORSE TIME.

01:14.800 --> 01:18.067
- I GOT THE TIVO GUY HERE.
- OH MY GOD!

01:18.067 --> 01:19.467
- HEY, YOU GOT THE WARRANTY
ON THIS THING?
- Larry!

01:19.500 --> 01:21.600
- THE WARRANTY.
- OH WAIT, HOLD ON.

01:21.633 --> 01:24.500
- WE'RE GOING THROUGH
A REALLY BIG STORM RIGHT NOW.
- Hold on one second.

01:24.533 --> 01:26.367
- I NEED A WARRANTY CARD.
- HONEY, LET ME ASK
YOU A QUESTION.

01:26.400 --> 01:28.467
DO YOU HAVE A--
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
THE WARRANTY CARD IS

01:28.500 --> 01:29.800
- ON THE TIVO?
- No, I-I don't.

01:29.833 --> 01:31.900
IN CASE SOMETHING
HAPPENS TO ME--

01:31.933 --> 01:34.167
- I MEAN, IT'S REALLY BAD.
- IS IT IN THE KITCHEN DRAWER
BY ANY CHANCE?

01:34.200 --> 01:35.733
- WHAT?
- I'm sorry,
I can't hear you.

01:35.767 --> 01:37.167
- WHAT IS THAT?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
- DO YOU KNOW WHO

01:37.200 --> 01:38.700
- THE GUY WAS THAT CAME OUT?
- NO, I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU.

01:38.733 --> 01:41.100
LARRY, I JUST WANNA
TELL YOU JUST IN CASE...

01:41.133 --> 01:43.500
- I can't hear you, honey.
Wait, hold on one second.
- ...FOR SOME REASON

01:43.533 --> 01:45.233
- I don't make it home...
- YOU KNOW WHO THE GUY WAS WO
CAME AND PUT THIS THING IN?

01:45.267 --> 01:47.367
- YOU KNOW WHO THE GUY WAS
WHO INSTALLED--
- I DON'T KNOW.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.400
- I DON'T KNOW HIS NAME.
- WAS IT TOM OR SOMETHING?

01:49.433 --> 01:51.067
- I just want you to know--
- OR DON? SOMETHING LIKE THA?

01:51.067 --> 01:54.667
- MAYBE BILL OR JAMES?
- OH MY GOD!

01:54.700 --> 01:56.567
I'LL COME BACK
LATER THIS AFTERNOON,

01:56.600 --> 01:57.900
- BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE REALLY BUSY.
- OH NO, JEEZ.

01:57.933 --> 02:00.300
HONEY, I'M SORRY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
PLEASE.

02:00.333 --> 02:01.967
He's gonna go.
I'm never gonna get
him again.

02:02.067 --> 02:03.700
TiVo guy:
It's all right.I can come back.

02:03.733 --> 02:05.133
NO, STAY RIGHT THERE.
CALL ME BACK IN 10
MINUTES, OKAY?

02:05.167 --> 02:06.900
- WHAT?
- I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I love you.

02:06.933 --> 02:08.700
- KEEP TALKING.
I'LL COME BACK.
- NO NO, THAT'S OKAY.

02:08.733 --> 02:10.867
- STAY-- STAY RIGHT HERE.
- LARRY!

02:20.767 --> 02:22.967
Boy:
Isn't he something,
Billy?

02:23.067 --> 02:24.433
Have you ever
seen horses like him?

02:24.467 --> 02:26.533
Man:
Not quite.

02:26.567 --> 02:30.133
HEY! TURNED IT OFF.

02:30.167 --> 02:32.267
GUESS WHAT?

02:32.300 --> 02:34.667
WE'RE HAVING DINNER
AT PRIMO'S TONIGHT.
I MADE A RESERVATION.

02:34.700 --> 02:36.933
THAT'S YOUR HUSBAND.

02:36.967 --> 02:40.067
I'M LEAVING.

02:42.967 --> 02:46.533
I'M LEAVING, LARRY.
I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

02:48.733 --> 02:50.867
YOU CAN'T DO THIS?
WHAT?

02:50.900 --> 02:52.467
WHAT? WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU T--

02:52.500 --> 02:55.833
DOES THAT REALLY
SURPRISE YOU?

02:55.867 --> 02:58.267
WHAT DO YOU
MEAN YOU'RE LEAVING?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:58.300 --> 03:00.067
I JUST CALLED YOU
FROM AN AIRPLANE,

03:00.067 --> 03:02.067
TELLING YOU I WAS
ABOUT TO CRASH.

03:02.100 --> 03:04.200
THE TIVO GUY WAS HERE.

03:04.233 --> 03:07.100
I COULD BARELY HEAR
WHAT YOU WERE SAYING.
HE WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE.

03:07.133 --> 03:09.667
I COULDN'T EVEN
GET THE GUY TO COME
TO THE HOUSE.

03:09.700 --> 03:12.067
YOU KNOW, IT'S VERY HARD
TO GET THOSE PEOPLE HERE.
IT WAS BROKEN.

03:12.067 --> 03:13.433
- OH, REALLY?
- I GOT IT FIXED FOR YOU.

03:13.467 --> 03:15.233
- WELL, OKAY.
- I SAVED ALL YOUR SHOWS.

03:15.267 --> 03:17.733
"BAREFOOT CONTESSA,"
"TOP CHEF," "PROJECT RUNWAY."

03:17.767 --> 03:19.567
I WOULDN'T LET HIM.
I SAVED THOSE SHOWS
FOR YOU.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.067
WE'VE GOT THESE
SHOWS RIGHT HERE.

03:21.100 --> 03:24.267
IT'S NOT JUST
ABOUT THE TIVO.

03:24.300 --> 03:26.400
WHAT? WHAT ELSE
IS IT ABOUT?

03:26.433 --> 03:28.067
"WHAT ELSE IS IT ABOUT?"

03:28.067 --> 03:29.933
IT'S ALL OF IT.

03:29.967 --> 03:32.100
YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING
LIKE A NORMAL PERSON.

03:32.133 --> 03:34.267
IT'S ABOUT TALKING
DURING SEX.

03:34.300 --> 03:36.267
SO I TALK DURING SEX.
SO WHAT?

03:36.300 --> 03:38.833
- IT'S NOT DIRTY TALK.
YOU CHITCHAT.
- SO?

03:38.867 --> 03:42.567
"WHO CAN'T TELL
THAT REAL CRAB
ISN'T FAKE CRAB?"

03:42.600 --> 03:45.367
BY THE WAY, PEOPLE SHOULD
BE ABLE TO TELL REAL CRAB
FROM FAKE CRAB.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.633
YOU'VE GOTTA BE A MORON
IF YOU CAN'T TELL
THE DIFFERENCE.

03:47.667 --> 03:49.067
- THAT'S WHAT I THINK.
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:49.067 --> 03:50.967
IF I BRING THAT UP
WHILE WE'RE HAVING SEX,

03:51.067 --> 03:52.967
THAT'S A FUN TOPIC
TO DISCUSS.

03:53.067 --> 03:54.400
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE THING IS, LARRY?

03:54.433 --> 03:57.067
PEOPLE ASK ME ALL THE TIME,
"HOW DO YOU STAY WITH HIM?"

03:57.067 --> 03:59.900
AND I ALWAYS TELL THEM,
"THERE'S ANOTHER SIDE TO LARRY
THAT YOU DON'T SEE."

04:00.067 --> 04:02.600
AND THEN I JUST
REALIZED TODAY
THERE'S NO OTHER SIDE.

04:02.633 --> 04:04.733
- NO, THERE'S ANOTHER SIDE.
- THERE'S NO OTHER SIDE!

04:04.767 --> 04:06.333
- THIS IS IT!
- THERE'S A LOT OF SIDES.
I'M COMPLEX!

04:06.367 --> 04:09.833
AFTER I THOUGHT
I WAS GONNA DIE

04:09.867 --> 04:11.933
AND YOU HUNG UP ON ME,

04:11.967 --> 04:13.500
I STARTED TALKING
TO THE GUY NEXT TO ME

04:13.533 --> 04:16.567
AND I REALIZED
NOT EVERYBODY'S LIKE YOU.

04:16.600 --> 04:20.167
THERE ARE NORMAL PEOPLE
OUT THERE THAT HAVE
CONVERSATIONS.

04:20.200 --> 04:22.433
- OH, THE GUY NEXT TO YOU.
- INTERESTED IN OTHER PEOPLE.

04:22.467 --> 04:26.533
AND WE HAD A VERY...
SOULFUL CONVERSATION...

04:26.567 --> 04:28.767
- THAT'S SWEET.
- ...ABOUT LI-- OKAY, SEE?

04:28.800 --> 04:30.333
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

04:30.367 --> 04:32.833
OKAY, THIS GUY.
DOES HE CARRY MINTS
AND A PEN AND TISSUES

04:32.867 --> 04:36.133
AT ALL TIMES
LIKE I DO, HUH?

04:36.167 --> 04:37.667
DOES HE HAVE MINTS?
HOW IS HIS BREATH?

04:37.700 --> 04:39.600
- VERY PLEASANT.
- REALLY?

04:39.633 --> 04:42.433
- WHAT DOES HE DO?
- HE OWNS AN UNDERWEAR
COMPANY.

04:42.467 --> 04:45.267
- MM-HMM, YES.
- OH, AN UNDERWEAR COMPANY.
WHAT KIND OF UNDERWEAR?

04:45.300 --> 04:48.067
HE INVENTED--

04:48.100 --> 04:49.700
IT DOESN'T MATTER--

04:49.733 --> 04:51.200
UNDERWEAR THAT
DOESN'T HAVE A FLY.

04:51.233 --> 04:53.467
NO-FLY ZONE?

04:53.500 --> 04:55.767
NO-FLY ZONE.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.500
THAT IS
THE DUMBEST COMPANY.

04:57.533 --> 05:00.267
WHAT A STUPID--
I'VE TRIED THAT UNDERWEAR.
IT IS SO IDIOTIC.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.067
YOU HAVE TO DROP
THE UNDERWEAR

05:02.067 --> 05:05.167
- TO PEE, OKAY?
- I THINK WE JUST NEED
A LITTLE TIME APART.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.233
I'M GONNA BE
AT MY SISTER'S.

05:07.267 --> 05:09.400
- DON'T DO THIS.
THIS IS CRAZY, HONEY.
- LARRY.

05:09.433 --> 05:11.200
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
THIS FOR? WHAT?

05:11.233 --> 05:14.067
I LOVE YOU.
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

05:14.067 --> 05:16.367
YOU WEREN'T THERE
FOR ME WHEN I NEEDED YOU.

05:16.400 --> 05:19.100
- I COULDN'T HEAR YOU.
- I'LL BE AT BECKY'S.

05:22.367 --> 05:24.733
YOU'RE TALKING
ON AN AIRPLANE PHONE.

05:27.900 --> 05:30.300
( people chattering )

05:32.433 --> 05:34.700
YEAH, I DIDN'T THINK
I WAS GONNA LIKE THIS.

05:34.733 --> 05:37.300
USUALLY I DON'T
LIKE THE SKIN.
IT'S DELICIOUS.

05:37.333 --> 05:40.567
I MARINATE IT
AFTER I ROAST IT.

05:44.433 --> 05:46.233
CHERYL LEFT ME.

05:46.267 --> 05:49.067
- WHAT?
- WHAT? WHAT DO YOU
MEAN SHE LEFT YOU?

05:49.067 --> 05:50.833
- SHE'S GONE.
SHE LEFT.
- REALLY?

05:50.867 --> 05:52.567
SHE'S GONE,
SHE'S OUT OF THE HOUSE.

05:52.600 --> 05:55.333
- SUITCASE... CLOTHES.
- Susie: OH, SHE'LL COME BACK.

05:55.367 --> 05:57.567
SHE'S WITH HER SISTER.
SHE'S NOT COMING BACK.

05:57.600 --> 05:59.100
DO YOU WANT
SOMETHING TO EAT, SWEETIE?
LET ME GET YOU SOMETHING.

05:59.133 --> 06:01.067
- JODI, GET HIM
A CHAIR, PLEASE.
- OH, SURE.

06:01.100 --> 06:02.733
- Marty: WHAT HAPPENED?
- Susie: LET ME GET
YOU A PLATE.

06:02.767 --> 06:05.267
YOU KNOW, SHE WAS
COMING BACK ON A PLANE,
AND THERE WAS A STORM,

06:05.300 --> 06:09.400
AND SHE CALLED ME
FROM THE PLANE.

06:09.433 --> 06:11.433
AND YOU KNOW,
I HAD THE TIVO GUY
IN THE HOUSE.

06:11.467 --> 06:13.600
SO?

06:13.633 --> 06:16.267
WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S SO HARD TO GET
THE TIVO GUY, MAN.

06:16.300 --> 06:18.367
THIS GUY WOULD
KEEP EXCHANGING CALLS.
I CAN'T GET HIM THERE.

06:18.400 --> 06:21.633
SO HE'S FINALLY THERE,
AND THE WHOLE CALL

06:21.667 --> 06:23.833
HE'S KIND OF
TALKING TO ME, GOING--

06:23.867 --> 06:26.100
WHAT'S WITH
THE SMALL PLATE?

06:26.133 --> 06:29.067
- THAT'S THE ONLY ONE
I HAD CLEAN.
- WHAT?

06:29.100 --> 06:31.567
- SUCH A TINY PLATE?
- IT'S THE SAME EXACT PORTION.
IT'S JUST AS--

06:31.600 --> 06:34.067
- WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
- IT'S WHAT MY GRANDMOTHER
USED TO EAT FROM.

06:34.100 --> 06:36.767
WHAT HAPPENED
WITH CHERYL ON THE PLANE?

06:36.800 --> 06:39.067
THERE WAS
A LOT OF TURBULENCE.
SHE WAS REALLY FRIGHTENED.

06:39.067 --> 06:42.367
THE TIVO GUY WAS THERE.
I COULDN'T REALLY TALK,

06:42.400 --> 06:45.233
AND... I TOLD HER
TO CALL ME BACK
IN 10 MINUTES.

06:45.267 --> 06:46.467
- WHAT?
- OH, LARRY.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.333
Marty:
THE PLANE'S GOING DOWN,

06:48.367 --> 06:50.233
- AND YOU SAID,
"CALL ME BACK"?
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

06:50.267 --> 06:52.167
- YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT.
- I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS
GOING DOWN!

06:52.200 --> 06:53.900
- OKAY OKAY. ALL RIGHT,
YOU KNOW WHAT?
- I DIDN'T KNOW.

06:53.933 --> 06:56.633
SHE'S GONNA GET OVER IT,
AND IT'S ALL GONNA BE OKAY.

06:56.667 --> 06:59.333
NO, SHE'S NOT GONNA GET
OVER IT, BECAUSE SHE MET
A GUY ON THE PLANE.

06:59.367 --> 07:00.933
- Susie: WHAT? WHERE DID
SHE MEET ANOTHER GUY?
- REALLY?

07:00.967 --> 07:03.200
- Larry: ON THE PLANE.
- WHILE THE PLANE
WAS GOING DOWN?

07:03.233 --> 07:04.933
- GUY SITTING NEXT TO HER.
- All: OH, NO.

07:04.967 --> 07:06.767
Jeff:
GUY SITTING
NEXT TO HER.

07:06.800 --> 07:10.300
WHAT A SCUMBAG.
TAKES ADVANTAGE OF A MARRIED
WOMAN WHO'S SCARED.

07:10.333 --> 07:13.200
I FEEL TERRIBLE.
I'M EMOTIONALLY
DISTRAUGHT OVER THIS.

07:13.233 --> 07:16.300
I MEAN, I KNOW
THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN
TO NAN AND MYSELF.

07:16.333 --> 07:19.700
- OF COURSE NOT.
- BUT I WANNA SAY
ONE THING.

07:19.733 --> 07:23.067
OKAY, CHERYL'S A GREAT GIRL.

07:23.067 --> 07:25.300
SHE'S ADORABLE,
GOOD COOK,

07:25.333 --> 07:27.067
FUN TO BE WITH.

07:27.067 --> 07:28.967
SHE HAS A TERRIFIC BODY.

07:29.067 --> 07:31.867
- USED TO BE AMAZING.
- I REMEMBER.

07:31.900 --> 07:35.600
- IT'S TRUE.
- BUT LET ME MAKE
MY POINT.

07:35.633 --> 07:39.200
NONE OF US
AT THIS TABLE EVER
WOULD HAVE MET CHERYL

07:39.233 --> 07:41.700
- IF NOT FOR LARRY DAVID.
- Susie: THAT'S TRUE.

07:41.733 --> 07:43.733
- Jeff: VERY TRUE.
- I BROUGHT HER INTO
YOUR LIVES.

07:43.767 --> 07:45.800
CHERYL'S A GREAT GIRL,

07:45.833 --> 07:47.700
BUT WE HAVE
TO STICK WITH LARRY.

07:47.733 --> 07:49.633
PEOPLE ARE GONNA
TAKE SIDES NOW.

07:49.667 --> 07:52.367
LISTEN, THIS IS
A TIME THAT WE HAVE TO
STAND BEHIND LARRY.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.833
( ringing )

07:54.867 --> 07:57.867
HEY, THAT COULD BE CHERYL.

07:57.900 --> 07:59.900
YOU'LL GET IT LATER.
WE DON'T ANSWER THE PHONE
AT DINNER.

08:00.067 --> 08:02.600
- WHAT? I'LL ANSWER IT.
- NO NO NO. NO, THE PHONE
IS NOT--

08:02.633 --> 08:04.300
WHAT KIND OF FUCKED UP
RULE IS THAT?

08:04.333 --> 08:06.167
- NO, WE DON'T
ANSWER THE PHONE.
- GET THE HELL--

08:06.200 --> 08:09.067
- WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY?
- YOU DON'T ANSWER THE PHONE.
GIVE ME THAT!

08:09.100 --> 08:10.967
- ( groaning )
- GIVE IT TO ME!

08:11.067 --> 08:12.767
WE DON'T ANSWER THE PHONE
DURING DINNER! IT'S A RULE!

08:12.800 --> 08:15.100
- YOU JAMMED MY THUMB.
- Susie: YOU WEREN'T INVITED.

08:15.133 --> 08:16.667
GO EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE!

08:16.700 --> 08:18.767
OH, JESUS.

08:18.800 --> 08:20.833
I FORGOT TO CANCEL
MY RESERVATIONS AT PRIMO'S.

08:20.867 --> 08:22.867
- I'LL USE MY CELL PHONE.
- OUT IN THE HALL,

08:22.900 --> 08:25.367
- NOT IN THE KITCHEN.
- ALL RIGHT, PIPE DOWN.

08:25.400 --> 08:27.367
( phone rings )

08:27.400 --> 08:28.867
THANK YOU
FOR CALLING PRIMO'S.
THIS IS IRIS.

08:28.900 --> 08:31.800
OH, HI, THIS IS
LARRY DAVID CALLING.

08:31.833 --> 08:34.400
OH, HI, MR. DAVID.
WE HAVE YOU DOWN
FOR 7:30 TONIGHT.

08:34.433 --> 08:35.933
Oh, you know what?

08:35.967 --> 08:38.267
I'M-- I'M GONNA
HAVE TO CANCEL.

08:38.300 --> 08:41.167
OH, I'M SO SORRY.
MAY I ASK WHY?

08:41.200 --> 08:44.867
WELL, IF YOU MUST KNOW,

08:44.900 --> 08:46.700
MY WIFE LEFT ME.

08:46.733 --> 08:50.700
- YOUR WIFE LEFT YOU.
- YEAH, MY WIFE LEFT ME.

08:50.733 --> 08:52.867
OKAY, MR. DAVID,
IN THE FUTURE,

08:52.900 --> 08:54.833
IT WOULD BE NICE
JUST TO GET A LITTLE
MORE NOTICE

08:54.867 --> 08:57.700
- when you wanna
cancel a reservation.
- YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME?

08:57.733 --> 09:00.667
SURE I BELIEVE YOU.
YOUR WIFE LEFT YOU. OKAY.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.433
YOU KNOW, I'M GETTING
FROM YOUR TONE THAT YOU
DON'T BELIEVE ME.

09:02.467 --> 09:04.167
you have to cancel.
I understand.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.767
I'M JUST SAYING
THAT IT'S OUR POLICY
TO GET A LITTLE MORE NOTICE.

09:06.800 --> 09:09.500
OKAY, IN THE FUTURE,
IF MY WIFE LEAVES ME,

09:09.533 --> 09:11.167
I'LL MAKE SURE
SHE DOES IT IN
THE MORNING.

09:11.200 --> 09:13.800
HAVE A GREAT NIGHT.

09:21.667 --> 09:23.600
MAXWELLS?

09:23.633 --> 09:26.700
- YOU OKAY?
- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

09:26.733 --> 09:28.900
THAT'S SIMON'S
BIRTHDAY PARTY.

09:28.933 --> 09:31.367
HE'S HAVING IT
AT MAXWELLS?

09:31.400 --> 09:33.533
BIG BAND,
SPECIAL GUEST.

09:33.567 --> 09:35.267
- HE'S GOING ALL OUT.
- SPECIAL GUEST?

09:35.300 --> 09:37.267
WHO GOES ALL OUT
FOR A BIRTHDAY PARTY?
LIKE, THAT'S CRAZY.

09:37.300 --> 09:39.767
I THOUGHT HE WAS
HAVING THIS IN HIS HOUSE.
YOU KNOW HOW EXPENSIVE THAT IS?

09:39.800 --> 09:41.833
I LOANED HIM
$10,000 LAST MONTH.

09:41.867 --> 09:44.200
- LAST MONTH?
- YEAH, HE SAID
HE NEEDED THE MONEY.

09:44.233 --> 09:46.833
HE NEEDED IT TO GIVE
HIMSELF A BIRTHDAY PARTY
AT MAXWELLS!

09:46.867 --> 09:48.967
I'M PAYING
FOR THIS THING.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.733
- HEY.
- HI.

09:56.767 --> 09:59.300
I'M SORRY.
I JUST CAME BY TO PICK UP
A FEW MORE THINGS.

09:59.333 --> 10:02.200
OH. OH.

10:02.233 --> 10:05.533
I'M SO GLAD
YOU'RE HERE,

10:05.567 --> 10:08.267
BECAUSE I--

10:08.300 --> 10:10.167
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

10:10.200 --> 10:12.500
- CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?
- YEAH.

10:12.533 --> 10:14.467
I NEED YOU TO DO
SOMETHING FOR ME

10:14.500 --> 10:16.700
- IF IT WOULD BE OKAY.
- OKAY.

10:16.733 --> 10:19.533
I HAD TO CALL PRIMO'S

10:19.567 --> 10:22.233
- TO CANCEL
OUR RESERVATION.
- YEAH.

10:22.267 --> 10:24.733
AND THE HOSTESS
ASKED ME

10:24.767 --> 10:26.833
WHY I WAS CANCELING,

10:26.867 --> 10:29.600
AND I TOLD HER
IT WAS BECAUSE
YOU LEFT ME.

10:29.633 --> 10:31.367
MM-HMM.

10:31.400 --> 10:34.467
BUT I DON'T THINK
SHE BELIEVED ME.

10:34.500 --> 10:37.800
SO WHAT I'D LIKE
YOU TO DO

10:37.833 --> 10:40.733
IS TO CALL THE RESTAURANT

10:40.767 --> 10:43.167
AND JUST SORT OF,
YOU KNOW,

10:43.200 --> 10:45.100
CONFIRM MY STORY.

10:46.700 --> 10:50.500
YOU WANT ME
TO CALL A STRANGER
AT A RESTAURANT

10:50.533 --> 10:52.700
AND TALK TO THEM
ABOUT OUR MARRIAGE?

10:52.733 --> 10:55.533
WELL, SHE'S NOT
REALLY A STRANGER.
IRIS, YOU KNOW IRIS.

10:55.567 --> 10:57.833
- THE HOSTESS.
SHE WORKS THERE.
- I DON'T REALLY KNOW IRIS.

10:57.867 --> 10:59.367
YOU KNOW THE ONE.
SHE'S GOT THE LONG HAIR.

10:59.400 --> 11:00.933
I KNOW WHO YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT,

11:00.967 --> 11:03.067
BUT I REALLY DON'T
THINK I WANT TO CALL HER

11:03.067 --> 11:06.133
AND TELL HER
THAT WE'RE BREAKING UP.

11:06.167 --> 11:08.100
YOU KNOW, SHE SAID
SHE BELIEVED ME,

11:08.133 --> 11:11.133
BUT THERE WAS
SOMETHING IN HER TONE

11:11.167 --> 11:14.500
THAT TOLD ME THAT MAYBE
SHE THOUGHT I WAS MAKING
THIS UP OR SOMETHING.

11:14.533 --> 11:15.967
I MEAN, WHO WOULD
GO TO THE LENGTHS

11:16.067 --> 11:18.933
OF SAYING THAT THEIR
WIFE SPLIT UP WITH THEM

11:18.967 --> 11:21.433
- AND THAT'S WHY
THEY HAD TO CANCEL?
- YOU WOULD.

11:23.333 --> 11:26.067
NOT SO SURE ABOUT THAT.
I DON'T THINK I WOULD.

11:26.100 --> 11:29.167
YEAH WELL, EXCUSE ME.
I GOTTA ACTUALLY
GET THIS STUFF.

11:29.200 --> 11:32.200
( groans )

11:32.233 --> 11:34.067
CHERYL, DON'T GO.
COME ON.

11:34.067 --> 11:36.167
COME ON, JUST STAY.
DON'T, DON'T.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.833
I NEED TO GO, LARRY.

11:38.867 --> 11:40.133
WILL YOU CALL
THE RESTAURANT?

11:54.367 --> 11:56.233
( doorbell chimes )

11:56.267 --> 11:59.700
- HEY, LARRY.
- HEY, SIMON.

11:59.733 --> 12:01.833
- HOW ARE YOU?
- I'M OKAY.

12:01.867 --> 12:04.100
- GOOD GOOD,
GOOD GOOD.
- YOU KNOW,

12:04.133 --> 12:06.300
I WAS OVER AT JEFF'S,

12:06.333 --> 12:08.433
AND I NOTICED
THE INVITATION
TO YOUR PARTY.

12:08.467 --> 12:10.600
AREN'T THE INVITATIONS GREAT?
I TOOK A LOT OF TIME ON THAT.

12:10.633 --> 12:12.867
I HAD NO IDEA
THE PARTY WAS GONNA
BE AT MAXWELL'S

12:12.900 --> 12:14.867
- WITH THE OPEN BAR--
- OPEN BAR.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.333
--AND THE BAND,
AND THE SPECIAL GUESTS.

12:16.367 --> 12:18.733
WAIT TILL YOU HEAR
ABOUT THE SPECIAL GUEST.
YEAH.

12:18.767 --> 12:21.867
I LOANED YOU
$10,000 A MONTH AGO.

12:21.900 --> 12:24.167
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
YOU WERE HAVING THIS BIG
PARTY FOR YOURSELF.

12:24.200 --> 12:26.333
$10,000 HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE PARTY.

12:26.367 --> 12:28.067
- WELL, WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- NO NO NO NO.

12:28.100 --> 12:29.767
I'M NOT USING
THAT MONEY FOR THAT.
I'M USING THE MONEY

12:29.800 --> 12:31.100
- FOR SOMETHING ELSE.
AND I APPRECIATE IT.
- I KNOW,

12:31.133 --> 12:32.500
BUT YOU WOULD HAVE TO USE
THE MONEY FOR SOMETHING ELSE

12:32.533 --> 12:34.467
IF YOU DIDN'T
HAVE THIS PARTY.

12:34.500 --> 12:36.533
- YOU COULD HAVE
USED THE MONEY FOR THAT.
- DON'T CONNECT THE TWO,

12:36.567 --> 12:38.767
- BECAUSE THEY--
DON'T THINK OF THEM AS--
- WELL, I SEE THEM

12:38.800 --> 12:40.600
- AS BEING TOTALLY CONNECTED.
- NO, THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED
AT ALL.

12:40.633 --> 12:42.133
NO, HAVE NOTHING
TO DO WITH EACH OTHER.

12:42.167 --> 12:45.833
( chuckles )
SIMON, YOU'RE CRAZY,
YOU KNOW?

12:45.867 --> 12:49.067
ANYWAY, ALL RIGHT,
SO FINE.

12:49.100 --> 12:50.667
- YEAH.
- I'LL SEE YOU
AT MAXWELLS.

12:50.700 --> 12:52.400
THIS IS PROBABLY
GONNA BE SOME PARTY.

12:52.433 --> 12:54.900
UMM, OKAY,
HERE'S THE THING:

12:54.933 --> 12:57.300
CHERYL IS
GONNA BE THERE.

12:59.333 --> 13:01.067
ARE YOU COMFORTABLE
WITH THAT?

13:01.067 --> 13:02.600
I'M COMFORTABLE.

13:02.633 --> 13:06.300
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ELSE
WILL BE... COMFORTABLE.

13:06.333 --> 13:08.567
WELL, THEY'RE
GONNA HAVE TO--

13:08.600 --> 13:10.800
IT'S THEIR PROBLEM,
ISN'T IT, YOU KNOW?

13:10.833 --> 13:13.367
HERE'S THE THING--
MY WIFE AND I TALKED
ABOUT IT,

13:13.400 --> 13:15.867
AND... WE CHOSE CHERYL.

13:19.767 --> 13:22.167
BELIEVE THIS GUY?

13:22.200 --> 13:24.067
$10,000 I LOAN HIM.

13:24.067 --> 13:26.700
DISINVITES ME
FROM THE PARTY,
CHOOSING CHERYL.

13:26.733 --> 13:29.067
I'M PAYING FOR THAT PARTY.
YOU KNOW THAT? HEY, ZEV.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.767
- HELLO, LARRY DAVID.
- YOU'RE CLEANING YOUR
UNDERWEAR AND SOCKS?

13:31.800 --> 13:34.500
THAT'S ANOTHER THING--
I GOTTA GO BACK TO FLUFF
AND FOLD NOW.

13:34.533 --> 13:37.633
ALANA DIDN'T SHOW UP.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE
HER PHONE NUMBER.

13:37.667 --> 13:39.067
CHERYL TOOK CARE
OF ALL THAT STUFF.

13:39.100 --> 13:40.500
YOU'RE JUST LOST,
AREN'T YOU?

13:40.533 --> 13:42.867
- I'M COMPLETELY LOST.
- OH MY GOD.

13:42.900 --> 13:45.200
YOU KNOW WHAT I GOT
IN MY FOYER AT HOME?

13:45.233 --> 13:47.233
PICTURES OF ALL
MY DRY CLEANERS.

13:50.433 --> 13:53.067
HEY, XENA
THE WARRIOR PRINCESS.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.067
YEAH.

13:55.100 --> 13:56.867
- DID YOU USE
TO WATCH THAT SHOW?
- Jeff: OF COURSE.

13:56.900 --> 14:00.300
- YEAH, SHE'S PRETTY SEXY.
- OH, MY--

14:00.333 --> 14:03.267
WHAT THE HELL, LARRY?

14:03.300 --> 14:05.133
Larry:
OH MY GOD.
I'M SO SORRY.

14:05.167 --> 14:07.100
OH.

14:07.133 --> 14:09.300
- Zev:
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?
- Larry: OH, SHIT.

14:09.333 --> 14:10.867
- IT'S RIPPED.
- SHE DOESN'T COME
IN ANYMORE.

14:10.900 --> 14:12.767
HOW AM I GONNA
GET ANOTHER PICTURE?

14:12.800 --> 14:15.067
MAN.

14:15.067 --> 14:17.267
YOU CAN GET LUCY LAWLESS'S
PICTURE, CAN'T YOU?

14:17.300 --> 14:18.533
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL GET AHOLD
OF HER AGENT

14:18.567 --> 14:20.067
AND WE'LL FIND IT.
I'LL GET IT.

14:20.067 --> 14:21.533
OKAY, I'LL GET YOU
ANOTHER PICTURE.

14:21.567 --> 14:24.867
COULD YOU
HAVE HER MAKE IT OUT
TO "ZEV" THIS TIME?

14:24.900 --> 14:26.767
- YES. OKAY.
- THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.567
- I'M SORRY.
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.100
JUST GIVE ME
THE PICTURE.

14:30.133 --> 14:33.800
- I'LL GET THE PICTURE.
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

14:33.833 --> 14:36.933
Iris:
PLEASE TAKE THIS COUPLE
OVER TO TABLE £24.

14:36.967 --> 14:38.900
THANKS,
HAVE A NICE DINNER.

14:45.267 --> 14:48.367
WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG,
MAY I ASK?

14:48.400 --> 14:50.600
OH, I'M SORRY, MR. DAVID.
WE'RE JUST REALLY
FULL TONIGHT.

14:50.633 --> 14:52.367
IT SHOULD JUST BE
A COUPLE MORE MINUTES.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.800
LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

14:54.833 --> 14:57.200
- DID MY WIFE CALL
THE RESTAURANT?
- NO.

14:57.233 --> 14:59.100
IS THAT WHY
I'M NOT GETTING
A TABLE?

14:59.133 --> 15:01.500
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
BELIEVE MY BREAKUP STORY

15:01.533 --> 15:03.733
- LAST NIGHT?
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

15:03.767 --> 15:06.333
- I THINK YOU DO KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
- NO, WE'RE JUST FULL TONIGHT.

15:06.367 --> 15:08.300
- WHY WOULD I MAKE THAT UP?
THAT'S INSANE.
- MR. DAVID,

15:08.333 --> 15:10.533
- WE'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.
- YOU HAVE TO BE INSANE TO MAKE
UP A STORY LIKE THAT.

15:10.567 --> 15:12.333
- OKAY.
- IF I WANTED TO CANCEL
A RESERVATION,

15:12.367 --> 15:13.867
AND NEEDED AN EXCUSE,
I WOULD JUST SAY I'M SICK
OR SOMETHING.

15:13.900 --> 15:15.867
PRIMO'S,
THIS IS IRIS.

15:15.900 --> 15:18.300
SURE, COME RIGHT IN.

15:18.333 --> 15:20.500
YOU KNOW, WE DID BREAK UP.
THAT'S WHY I HAD TO CANCEL
THE RESERVATION.

15:20.533 --> 15:21.867
OKAY, WE'LL
SEE YOU SOON.

15:26.867 --> 15:29.433
( chuckles )
YOU TOTALLY DESERVE THAT.

15:29.467 --> 15:32.067
YOU TOTALLY DESERVE IT.
YES, YOU DO.

15:32.067 --> 15:34.500
ON NO PLANET
IS A SHOE CADDY
A GOOD GIFT.

15:34.533 --> 15:36.267
THAT'S JUST A--
WHAT?

15:36.300 --> 15:38.067
ALL RIGHT, YEAH,
NO NO NO,

15:38.067 --> 15:40.367
I GET THAT
IT WAS PAYBACK, BUT--

15:40.400 --> 15:43.067
IT'S NOT LONG DISTANCE
EVEN IF IT'S IN INDIA.

15:43.100 --> 15:44.633
SO I'M ON
THE 14th HOLE, OKAY?

15:44.667 --> 15:46.433
LLOYD, HE'S GOT THESE
GREAT CUBAN CIGARS.

15:46.467 --> 15:48.233
- WHAT? I CAN'T
TALK TO YOU, MOM.
- SO WE'RE SMOKING THESE CIGARS.

15:48.267 --> 15:50.100
- I'VE GOT SOMEONE
ON THE OTHER LINE.
- SO I REACH DOWN

15:50.133 --> 15:51.767
- TO TAKE A PUFF...
- I CAN'T HEAR YOU.
IT'S LOUD IN HERE.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.933
- NO NO, JUST CALL THEM.
- ...AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
LLOYD GOES,

15:53.967 --> 15:56.233
- "WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?
THAT'S MY CIGAR!"
- I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

15:56.267 --> 15:58.467
- CALL THEM.
- SO I WAS TRYING TO BRUSH
MY TEETH WITH AN APPLE.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.500
- IT WAS HORRIBLE,
HORRIBLE.
- EXCUSE ME.

16:01.533 --> 16:03.700
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?

16:03.733 --> 16:06.433
- I'M TALKING TO MYSELF.
- WELL, YOU'RE DOING IT
REALLY LOUD.

16:06.467 --> 16:08.433
- OH, REALLY?
- YEAH YEAH.

16:08.467 --> 16:11.333
- YOU'RE KIND OF
TALKING LOUD YOURSELF.
- TO A PERSON.

16:11.367 --> 16:14.700
- WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
- I'M ACTUALLY CONVERSING
WITH ANOTHER HUMAN BEING.

16:14.733 --> 16:16.267
- OH, REALLY?
- VERY DIFFERENT
THAN JUST--

16:16.300 --> 16:18.233
TO THE OUTSIDE OBSERVER,
IT'S THE SAME LEVEL
OF ANNOYANCE.

16:18.267 --> 16:20.200
WELL, I NEED
TO TALK TO MY FRIEND.
I CAN BARELY HEAR HERE.

16:20.233 --> 16:22.267
OKAY, WELL, MAYBE
IF YOU TALK LOWER
TO YOUR FRIEND,

16:22.300 --> 16:23.533
- I'LL TALK LOWER
TO MY OTHER SELF.
- GREAT GREAT.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.667
- YEAH, GOOD PLAN.
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

16:25.700 --> 16:27.633
JESUS CHRIST.
I'M LITERALLY SITTING
MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS...

16:27.667 --> 16:29.233
WHAT A SCHMUCK.
HE'S BEEN TALKING ON HIS
PHONE THE WHOLE DINNER.

16:29.267 --> 16:31.067
...AND THIS GUY
IS TALKING TO HIMSELF.
HE'S STILL DOING IT.

16:31.067 --> 16:32.433
DO YOU HEAR THAT?
LISTEN, YOU HEAR THIS?

16:32.467 --> 16:34.200
HE DOESN'T EVEN THINK
HE'S BEING ANNOYING.

16:34.233 --> 16:35.567
HE THINKS HE CAN
JUST SIT THERE AND TALK
OUT LOUD NOT BE ANNOYING.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.633
DO YOU HEAR THAT?
HE'S LITERALLY JUST DOING IT

16:37.667 --> 16:39.300
- JUST TO BE ANNOYING.
- HE'S BEEN DRIVING ME NUTS
THE LAST 10 MINUTES.

16:39.333 --> 16:41.133
HONESTLY, I'M DONE ANYWAY.
THIS IS BULLSHIT.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.933
- I'M PAYING.
I DON'T CARE.
- NO, CAN YOU HEAR HIM?

16:42.967 --> 16:44.567
NO, HE'S STILL TALKING.
WAIT, I GOT STEVE ON
THE OTHER LINE.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.433
- HE WINS, HE WINS.
YEAH, YOU WIN.
- HEY, STEVE...

16:46.467 --> 16:47.933
- GOOD FOR YOU,
BEING ANNOYING.
- ...DO ME A FAVOR.

16:47.967 --> 16:50.200
REMIND ME--
THESE PEOPLE,
THEY'RE JUST...

16:52.600 --> 16:55.867
- WHO ARE YOU
TALKING TO?
- OH, HEY.

16:55.900 --> 16:58.167
- HI, JODI.
- HEY.

16:59.633 --> 17:01.500
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING TOMORROW?
LET'S PLAY GOLF.

17:01.533 --> 17:05.267
I CAN'T.
LARRY, THE FUNKHOUSERS
HAVE MADE A DECISION.

17:05.300 --> 17:08.333
WE'RE GOING WITH CHERYL.

17:08.367 --> 17:10.967
YEAH.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.367
( knocks )

17:26.133 --> 17:28.633
- OH. HI, BECKY.
- OH. HI.

17:28.667 --> 17:30.833
IS CHERYL HERE?

17:30.867 --> 17:34.533
NO, SHE'S NOT HERE
RIGHT NOW, SO...

17:34.567 --> 17:37.833
- YOU KNOW WHEN
SHE'LL BE BACK?
- NUH-UH, I DON'T,

17:37.867 --> 17:40.400
- BUT IT WAS
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- Larry: ALANA?

17:40.433 --> 17:43.467
- IS THAT ALANA?
- MR. LARRY.

17:44.500 --> 17:46.700
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:46.733 --> 17:48.667
I WORK FOR MRS. CHERYL.

17:48.700 --> 17:52.167
- YOU CHOSE CHERYL?
- YES.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.467
- ( door slams )
- Cheryl: HEY, BECKY?

17:54.500 --> 17:56.600
OH, I WASN'T SURE
IF YOU'D STILL BE HERE.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA--

17:56.633 --> 17:58.900
I AM, AND...

18:00.200 --> 18:03.067
- Cheryl: HI.
- HI.

18:03.067 --> 18:04.467
THIS IS GLENN.
THIS IS LARRY.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.467
- HEY.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

18:08.967 --> 18:11.067
NICE HEAD OF HAIR.

18:11.100 --> 18:14.367
OKAY. WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

18:14.400 --> 18:16.067
YOU NEED TO CALL
TED DANSON BACK.

18:16.067 --> 18:18.833
HE WANTED TO INVITE YOU
TO AN OCEANS FUNDRAISER.

18:18.867 --> 18:20.367
OH, YEAH.
OKAY, THANKS.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.900
- YOU'LL LIKE TED.
- Glenn: I LIKE THE OCEAN.

18:22.933 --> 18:25.200
- ( laughs )
THEN IT'S PERFECT.
- I'M VERY PRO-OCEAN.

18:25.233 --> 18:28.467
- SO GLENN, HOW'S THE NO-FLY
UNDERWEAR BUSINESS DOING?
- GREAT.

18:28.500 --> 18:29.900
- I TOLD HIM
ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS.
- Larry: YEAH.

18:29.933 --> 18:31.633
- IT'S GOING GREAT.
- IS IT?

18:31.667 --> 18:33.867
- YEAH.
- YOU THINK MEN
WANT AN UNDERWEAR

18:33.900 --> 18:35.967
- THAT HAS NO FLY?
- I KNOW THEY DO.

18:36.067 --> 18:39.067
74% OF THE MEN
WE TESTED GO OVER
THE FENCE.

18:39.067 --> 18:41.633
- OH, THEY DO?
- YEAH, THE REST
GO THROUGH THE GATE.

18:41.667 --> 18:43.300
- WELL--
- YOU'RE NOT GIVING
PEOPLE AN OPTION.

18:43.333 --> 18:45.833
THE PENIS NEEDS AN OPTION,
JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

18:45.867 --> 18:48.433
THE PENIS IS HUMAN.
IT NEEDS AN OPTION.

18:48.467 --> 18:51.667
ALL RIGHT,
WELL YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY GET GOING.

18:51.700 --> 18:53.833
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

18:53.867 --> 18:55.800
- MINT?
- NO.

18:57.133 --> 18:59.433
- TISSUE?
- NO, I--

19:03.067 --> 19:05.600
PEN?

19:10.700 --> 19:14.433
- IS THAT GLENN
WITH TWO "N"s?
- IT IS, IN FACT.

19:14.467 --> 19:16.533
Larry:
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WOULDN'T CARE--

19:16.567 --> 19:18.333
I WOULDN'T CARE
IF SHE LEFT ME
FOR A BALD GUY.

19:18.367 --> 19:20.233
RIGHT.

19:20.267 --> 19:24.067
- BUT THIS IS, LIKE,
THE WORST BETRAYAL.
- WHAT DOES HE LOOK LIKE?

19:24.067 --> 19:27.733
- THICK, LIKE PRESIDENTIAL
KENNEDY HAIR.
- OH.

19:27.767 --> 19:30.300
- AND HE MAKES UNDERWEAR?
- YEAH, NO-FLY UNDERWEAR,

19:30.333 --> 19:32.733
LIKE THERE'S
SOME GREAT CLAMORING
FOR NO-FLY UNDERWEAR.

19:32.767 --> 19:34.400
- WHO NEEDS
NO-FLY UNDERWEAR?
- I KNOW.

19:34.433 --> 19:36.433
A GUY WHO GOES
INTO A STORE AND GOES,
"I NEED A PAIR OF UNDERWEAR.

19:36.467 --> 19:38.333
- I GOT A VAGINA."
- I KNOW.

19:38.367 --> 19:39.967
- NO-FLY UNDERWEAR.
- ( cell rings )

19:40.067 --> 19:42.067
HELLO?
HOLD ON ONE SECOND.

19:44.100 --> 19:47.267
GREAT, THANK YOU
SO VERY MUCH.

19:47.300 --> 19:49.867
REALLY, THANK HIM.
THANKS, BYE.

19:49.900 --> 19:51.900
HERE YOU GO.

19:51.933 --> 19:54.067
LUCY LAWLESS.

19:54.067 --> 19:56.433
OH.
OH, YEAH.

19:56.467 --> 19:58.267
OH, THANKS.

19:58.300 --> 20:00.700
- LET ME CALL HER.
- WHICH WATER IS MINE?

20:00.733 --> 20:04.267
I DON'T KNOW.
I TOOK ONE SIP.

20:04.300 --> 20:06.133
I HAVE NO--

20:06.167 --> 20:08.167
- WE'LL HAVE TO GET MORE.
- WE'LL GET MORE WATER.

20:10.367 --> 20:12.600
- "TO ZEV..."
- Zev: ZEV, YES.

20:12.633 --> 20:15.433
- "...LUCY LAWLESS."
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

20:15.467 --> 20:17.000
I NOT ONLY GET YOU
THE PICTURE,

20:17.033 --> 20:18.367
I GET YOU LUCY LAWLESS.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.467
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- Lucy: MY PLEASURE.

20:20.500 --> 20:23.767
- WOW, YOU MAKE LOVELY "L"s.
- YOU GOT MY DRY CLEANING?

20:23.800 --> 20:25.533
TOMORROW AFTER 5:00.

20:30.800 --> 20:33.200
- HEY, THAT WAS
SO NICE OF YOU TO DO THAT.
- OH, YOU'RE WELCOME.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.467
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA
BE MORE BOWLED OVER

20:35.500 --> 20:37.733
BY YOUR PRESENCE.
HE TOOK IT PRETTY CALMLY.

20:37.767 --> 20:40.967
- PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS
EXPECTING SOMEONE BIGGER.
- I USED TO BE VERY INTIMIDATED

20:41.000 --> 20:42.733
- BY THAT WARRIOR PRINCESS,
I GOTTA TELL YOU.
- DID YOU REALLY?

20:42.767 --> 20:44.267
- YES.
- AND NOW?

20:44.300 --> 20:45.900
NOW THAT I SEE YOU
IN PERSON,

20:45.933 --> 20:47.733
- I ACTUALLY THINK
I CAN TAKE YOU.
- ( laughs )

20:49.333 --> 20:52.800
LOOK, I'M NOT A COOL GUY
OR ANYTHING, OKAY?

20:52.833 --> 20:54.700
I HAVEN'T BEEN
ON A DATE IN 12 YEARS,

20:54.733 --> 20:57.200
BUT I WOULD LOVE
TO WASTE YOUR TIME
FOR COUPLE OF HOURS.

20:57.233 --> 20:58.733
- ( laughs )
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT?

20:58.767 --> 21:00.833
CAN I DO THAT?
IS THAT POSSIBLE?

21:00.867 --> 21:02.533
- HOW ABOUT THAT?
- OKAY, YEAH.

21:02.567 --> 21:04.767
- HAVE YOU BEEN TO PRIMO'S?
- I HAVE NEVER BEEN
TO PRIMO'S.

21:04.800 --> 21:06.467
- I HEAR THAT
IT'S GREAT THOUGH.
- IT'S REALLY GOOD.

21:06.500 --> 21:08.333
ALL RIGHT, YEAH.
WELL, YOU'VE GOT
MY NUMBER.

21:08.367 --> 21:09.767
I DO.

21:09.800 --> 21:12.100
- Lucy: WELL...
- Larry: OH, JEEZ.

21:12.133 --> 21:14.400
- WH?
- TED DANSON.

21:14.433 --> 21:17.400
( whispering )
HE IS AN ASSHOLE.

21:17.433 --> 21:19.333
( whispers )
REALLY? YOU DON'T LIKE HIM?

21:19.367 --> 21:21.400
- I DESPISE HIM.
HE'S JUST TERRIBLE.
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

21:21.433 --> 21:22.800
- HI.
- HOW ARE YOU
DOING, MAN?

21:22.833 --> 21:24.267
- YOU KNOW
LUCY LAWLESS?
- I DO.

21:24.300 --> 21:25.700
- YEAH, WE MET.
- TED DANSON.

21:25.733 --> 21:28.867
- YEAH, NICE
TO SEE YOU.
- YOU TOO.

21:28.900 --> 21:30.733
- WELL, OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

21:30.767 --> 21:33.800
- BYE.
- ( laughs )

21:33.833 --> 21:36.067
WHAT IS THAT?
"CALL ME"?

21:36.100 --> 21:37.433
- DID SHE JUST
DO A "CALL ME"?
- YEAH, SHE DID.

21:37.467 --> 21:39.600
- WE'RE GOING
OUT TO DINNER.
- REALLY?

21:39.633 --> 21:41.367
- YES, YEAH.
- WELL, GOOD FOR YOU.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.500
I ASKED HER FOR A DATE.
HERE'S WHAT I SAID.

21:43.533 --> 21:46.100
"I'M NOT REALLY
A COOL GUY OR ANYTHING,"

21:46.133 --> 21:47.867
WHICH IS A PRETTY
GOOD LINE I THOUGHT.

21:47.900 --> 21:50.967
I NEVER DID THAT
WHEN I WAS DATING,
ADMIT THAT I WASN'T A COOL GUY.

21:51.067 --> 21:53.400
NOW I DIDN'T GIVE A SHIT.
I JUST SAID, "I'M NOT
A COOL GUY."

21:53.433 --> 21:57.067
IT FUCKING WORKED!
"I'M NOT A COOL GUY"!
I'M GONNA USE IT ALL THE TIME.

21:57.100 --> 21:58.867
- GOOD FOR YOU,
MAN, REALLY.
- THANK YOU.

21:58.900 --> 22:00.733
- THANK YOU.
- YEAH, YOU DESERVE THAT.

22:00.767 --> 22:03.367
- I GOTTA SCOOT.
- WAIT, LET ME ASK
YOU SOMETHING.

22:04.733 --> 22:06.800
HOW COME I WASN'T INVITED
TO YOUR FUNDRAISER?

22:08.067 --> 22:11.067
- WHA-WHAT FUNDRAISER?
- THE OCEANS FUNDRAISER.

22:11.067 --> 22:14.400
OH! I THOUGHT YOU WERE
A GLOBAL-WARMING GUY.

22:14.433 --> 22:15.800
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

22:17.933 --> 22:19.567
YOU'RE GOING WITH CHERYL,
AREN'T YOU?

22:19.600 --> 22:23.467
YEAH. YEAH.

22:33.067 --> 22:36.067
( laughing )

22:36.100 --> 22:39.633
Girl:
"OKAY, WHAT IS JIM JONES'S
MOST FAMOUS SONG?"

22:39.667 --> 22:42.767
- "BALLIN"!
- AND THERE HE IS, Y'ALL!

22:42.800 --> 22:45.067
( all cheering )

22:45.100 --> 22:46.700
- UH-OH, UH-OH.
- AND A LA-DI-DA.

22:46.733 --> 22:49.467
- NOT TOO MUCH?
NOT TOO DRESSY?
- All: NO.

22:49.500 --> 22:50.833
- NO, YOU LOOK GOOD.
- YOU'RE COOL, MAN.
YOU'RE COOL.

22:50.867 --> 22:52.333
YOU'RE BRINGING
IT TONIGHT, MAN.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

22:52.367 --> 22:54.067
WHAT, AM I GONNA SIT HOME?
SHE'S GOING OUT.

22:54.067 --> 22:56.367
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- SHE'S GOT A NEW
BOYFRIEND ALREADY!

22:56.400 --> 22:58.800
- YOUR TURN.
- BY THE WAY, GUESS WHO
I'M GOING OUT WITH?

22:58.833 --> 23:00.367
- WHO?
- Leon: WHO ARE YOU
GOING OUT WITH?

23:00.400 --> 23:03.100
XENA THE WARRIOR
PRINCESS.

23:03.133 --> 23:05.233
- OOH!
- WAIT A SECOND NOW.

23:05.267 --> 23:07.433
- WHAT?
- UH-HUH.

23:07.467 --> 23:09.367
- DO YOU LOVE THAT?
- I LOVE IT!

23:09.400 --> 23:11.100
- DON'T WAIT UP.
- Leon: DON'T WORRY,
WE WON'T.

23:11.133 --> 23:13.567
- MY MAN L.D.
- YEAH.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.067
SORRY YOU GOTTA MISS
THAT LAKERS GAME.

23:15.067 --> 23:16.767
- FORGET ABOUT IT.
- OH, I GOT TO TIVO IT.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.667
- ( screaming )
- Leon: WHAT?

23:18.700 --> 23:21.300
- WHAT THE HELL?
- Loretta: LARRY,
YOU ALL RIGHT?

23:21.333 --> 23:23.967
- YOU ALL RIGHT?
- LEON, GO HELP HIM.

23:24.067 --> 23:25.967
- Loretta: WHAT HAPPENED?
- Leon: WHAT HAPPENED, MAN?

23:26.067 --> 23:28.367
- YOU ALL RIGHT?
- Loretta: WHAT'S THE MATTER?

23:30.067 --> 23:31.533
Larry:
SO WHAT'S THE DEAL?

23:31.567 --> 23:33.567
- YEAH, WHAT'S THE DEAL?
- I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO EXPLAIN.

23:33.600 --> 23:35.433
BASED ON YOUR SIGNS
AND SYMPTOMS,

23:35.467 --> 23:37.467
WHEN YOU TWISTED
YOUR BODY,

23:37.500 --> 23:40.600
YOUR TESTICLES GOT ENSNARED
IN THE FLY OF YOUR UNDERWEAR,

23:40.633 --> 23:42.600
WHICH ACTED LIKE A NOOSE.

23:42.633 --> 23:45.867
AND IT CAUSED
SCROTAL HEMATOMA
AND CONTUSION.

23:45.900 --> 23:48.533
- TWISTED BALLS.
- IN LAYMAN'S TERMS, YES,

23:48.567 --> 23:50.267
BUT IT'S NOT
AS BAD AS IT SOUNDS.

23:50.300 --> 23:52.567
IT'S A BRUISING,
WHICH WILL PROBABLY
LAST ABOUT A WEEK OR SO.

23:52.600 --> 23:54.867
OH, OKAY.
- BUT I WOULD
DEFINITELY RECOMMEND

23:54.900 --> 23:57.367
SWITCHING TO A STYLE
OF UNDERWEAR WITH NO FLY.

23:57.400 --> 24:00.600
- NO-FLY ZONE? IS THAT
WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME?
- THAT'S EXACTLY IT.

24:00.633 --> 24:02.533
NO-FLY ZONE.
THAT'S A POPULAR BRAND.

24:02.567 --> 24:05.067
- I'M NOT WEARING
THAT UNDERWEAR, OKAY?
- YOU GOTTA DO IT, MAN.

24:05.067 --> 24:07.633
YOU GOT LONG BALLS, LARRY.
LONG BALLS.

24:07.667 --> 24:09.400
- YOU GOT LONG-ASS BALLS.
- I'VE GOT LONG BALLS?

24:09.433 --> 24:11.267
DOCTOR, YOU'VE SEEN
HIS BALLS, RIGHT?

24:11.300 --> 24:12.967
WOULD YOU SAY MY BALLS
WERE UNUSUALLY LONG?

24:13.067 --> 24:15.500
THEY'RE A BIT MORE DISTENDED
THAN THE AVERAGE TESTICLES.

24:15.533 --> 24:17.067
YOU GOT LONG-ASS
BALLS, LARRY.

24:17.067 --> 24:18.900
LONG-BALL LARRY.
THAT'S YOUR NEW NAME.

24:18.933 --> 24:20.867
LONG BALLS.
WHO THE HELL KNEW?

24:20.900 --> 24:23.967
LONG BALLS.
CHANGE THE DRAWS.

24:24.067 --> 24:27.067
OKAY, FINE.
I'LL WEAR THE NO-FLY ZONE.

24:27.067 --> 24:29.967
- HEY, THANKS FOR GETTING
ME THROUGH THIS SO FAST.
- YEAH, MY PLEASURE.

24:30.067 --> 24:32.533
YOU KNOW WHAT, I GOT A DATE.
I GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.

24:32.567 --> 24:35.333
OH YEAH, SPEAKING OF THAT,
YOU'RE GONNA WANNA ICE
YOUR TESTICLES,

24:35.367 --> 24:37.733
AND NO SEX FOR
AT LEAST A WEEK.

24:37.767 --> 24:40.600
I DON'T THINK THAT'S
GONNA BE A PROBLEM
FOR ME, BUT THANKS.

24:40.633 --> 24:42.133
THANKS FOR THE INFO.
ALL RIGHT.

24:42.167 --> 24:44.067
- GOOD LUCK.
- THANKS.

24:44.067 --> 24:45.967
MY MAN.

24:46.067 --> 24:49.200
- I GOT LONG BALLS.
- LONG-ASS BALLS.

24:49.233 --> 24:52.467
( Lucy laughing )

24:52.500 --> 24:55.600
I'VE ACTUALLY TRAINED
MY BODY NOT TO USE
PUBLIC TOILETS.

24:55.633 --> 24:57.067
TRAINED IT.

24:57.067 --> 24:59.467
SO I NEVER EVER HAVE
TO GO WHEN I'M OUT
OF MY HOUSE.

24:59.500 --> 25:00.933
YEAH, I'M GETTING
A RED FLAG HERE, LARRY.

25:00.967 --> 25:03.900
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE SHOULD SWITCH SIDES.
BECAUSE THE GAME'S ON.

25:03.933 --> 25:05.267
- I DON'T WANNA
LOOK AT IT.
- WHY NOT?

25:05.300 --> 25:07.867
BECAUSE I'M TIVOING IT.

25:07.900 --> 25:10.867
- OH, HATE SPOILERS, RIGHT?
- I CAN'T WATCH IT IF
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.

25:10.900 --> 25:14.900
- SO WHAT ELSE ABOUT YOU?
- I'M A MAN OF MYSTERY.

25:14.933 --> 25:18.133
- AND YOU'RE
A JEW, RIGHT?
- YEAH.

25:18.167 --> 25:20.067
- 'CAUSE WE DON'T HAVE
THOSE WHERE I COME FROM.
- REALLY?

25:20.100 --> 25:22.167
- NOPE.
- SO I MUST BE QUITE
FASCINATING TO YOU.

25:22.200 --> 25:23.900
YOU ARE SO EXOTIC
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

25:23.933 --> 25:25.100
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

25:25.133 --> 25:26.600
IT'S LIKE A BLACK MAN
IN SWEDEN.

25:26.633 --> 25:28.767
- IT'S EXACTLY
LIKE THAT.
- RIGHT?

25:28.800 --> 25:30.767
MR. AKIVO,
YOUR TABLE'S READY.
RIGHT THIS WAY PLEASE.

25:30.800 --> 25:32.767
SORRY FOR THE WAIT.

25:32.800 --> 25:35.467
OKAY, WE WERE DEFINITELY
HERE AHEAD OF THEM.

25:35.500 --> 25:36.867
- ABSOLUTELY.
- HUH, WERE WE NOT?

25:36.900 --> 25:39.367
- UH-HUH.
- I'M GONNA TALK
TO THE OWNER.

25:39.400 --> 25:41.133
HEY, PRIMO.

25:41.167 --> 25:43.200
MR. DAVID, GOOD EVENING.

25:43.233 --> 25:45.533
WHAT'S GOING ON?
ALL THESE PEOPLE
I CAME IN AHEAD OF

25:45.567 --> 25:47.600
ARE GETTING SEATED.
HOW COME I'M NOT
GETTING A TABLE?

25:47.633 --> 25:49.867
( sighs )

25:49.900 --> 25:51.667
MR. DAVID,

25:51.700 --> 25:54.967
THERE IS NO TABLE.

25:55.067 --> 25:57.733
NO TABLE? HOW COME?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
