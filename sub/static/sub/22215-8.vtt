00:29.077 --> 00:31.265
The Crimson have taken Arborlon.

00:35.620 --> 00:36.786
Body's still warm.

00:39.090 --> 00:40.642
Any sign of the other Chosen?

00:40.648 --> 00:42.115
Should be six more.

00:44.754 --> 00:46.917
Fresh tracks heading east
into the woods.

00:52.329 --> 00:54.391
The Crimson, how many were there?

00:54.397 --> 00:55.610
Too many.

00:59.302 --> 01:01.436
The Chosen are
the keepers of the Ellcrys.

01:01.471 --> 01:03.534
Riga's sending a message.

01:03.540 --> 01:05.140
Anyone who protects magic will die.

01:05.742 --> 01:07.004
We have to stop this.

01:07.010 --> 01:09.473
No, we're not. You have to see Amberle.

01:09.479 --> 01:10.879
We can't just do nothing.

01:11.982 --> 01:15.613
I'll find The Chosen.
But Amberle asked for you.

01:15.619 --> 01:17.652
She said the fate of the
Four Lands depends on you.

01:18.822 --> 01:20.889
So you're going in there to see her.

01:23.460 --> 01:24.492
Now.

03:41.765 --> 03:43.124
You don't know how many times

03:43.131 --> 03:45.280
I've come to the Ellcrys
and tried to talk to you.

03:47.137 --> 03:48.219
I know.

03:49.639 --> 03:50.905
I heard you.

03:54.311 --> 03:56.038
Then why didn't you answer me?

03:57.180 --> 03:58.880
There was nothing I could say.

04:01.584 --> 04:02.917
How about goodbye?

04:05.221 --> 04:06.984
It all happened so fast.

04:06.990 --> 04:08.489
One minute we were in the Sanctuary

04:09.159 --> 04:10.325
and the next you were...

04:11.528 --> 04:13.261
I made the choice, Wil.

04:18.168 --> 04:20.351
It was the only way
to save the Four Lands.

04:23.606 --> 04:24.639
I know.

04:26.309 --> 04:28.009
And I tried to make peace with that.

04:30.513 --> 04:32.180
It's been difficult, I know.

04:33.650 --> 04:35.183
Difficult?

04:38.488 --> 04:40.021
I loved you.

04:41.891 --> 04:44.192
I still love you, Amberle.

04:45.362 --> 04:46.490
What we have...

04:46.496 --> 04:48.196
What we had

04:50.600 --> 04:54.035
was a moment in time
we can always cherish

04:56.373 --> 04:57.939
But that time has passed.

05:00.377 --> 05:01.876
Maybe for you.

05:03.179 --> 05:04.846
You made the decision.

05:05.648 --> 05:07.378
You never told me or included me

05:07.384 --> 05:09.550
you just left me alone
to pick up the pieces.

05:10.453 --> 05:12.019
You're angry.

05:13.189 --> 05:16.620
And you have every right to be

05:16.626 --> 05:20.061
but this was my destiny
and now you must face yours.

05:21.598 --> 05:22.997
Look

05:23.633 --> 05:25.566
I know what's at stake.

05:26.536 --> 05:28.065
The Warlock Lord is back

05:28.071 --> 05:30.571
and supposedly I'm the only one
who can defeat him.

05:31.107 --> 05:32.703
Except I can't.

05:32.709 --> 05:35.572
I've seen my truth
and it's not what you think

05:35.578 --> 05:36.644
What did you see?

05:37.247 --> 05:38.312
That I fail.

05:39.182 --> 05:40.248
I don't defeat him.

05:42.385 --> 05:44.986
The Warlock Lord
kills everyone I care about.

05:46.256 --> 05:47.722
Allanon

05:48.691 --> 05:49.924
Eretria...

05:50.560 --> 05:51.826
And Mareth?

05:56.533 --> 05:58.254
Unlike you and my father

05:59.269 --> 06:01.235
I'm not strong enough to save the world.

06:04.908 --> 06:08.376
The truth that I saw is that
the Warlock Lord wins.

06:13.716 --> 06:16.847
Wil, the truth is yet to be.

06:16.853 --> 06:20.851
The Warlock Lord is powerful in
ways you have yet to encounter.

06:20.857 --> 06:24.792
His dark magic is unmatched.
But you can defeat him.

06:25.628 --> 06:27.691
Tell me how.

06:27.697 --> 06:30.260
He has a weakness.

06:30.266 --> 06:32.134
It's the thing that
destroyed him the last time

06:32.141 --> 06:34.166
he walked the earthly plane.

06:36.506 --> 06:39.303
- The Sword of Shannara.
- Yes.

06:39.309 --> 06:41.976
And, as the Shannara,
only you can wield it.

06:43.913 --> 06:46.777
So the one thing standing between
my saving the Four Lands

06:46.783 --> 06:48.983
and total annihilation is the sword?

06:51.221 --> 06:53.054
Then we have a really big problem.

07:18.481 --> 07:21.015
Why has a mortal boy

07:21.718 --> 07:23.918
awoken the Warlock Lord

07:26.356 --> 07:31.399
imprisoning me in the flesh
of my mortal enemy?

07:33.997 --> 07:35.496
To be your servant.

07:37.233 --> 07:39.433
And yet there is something else.

07:41.504 --> 07:43.871
Something on your mind.

07:44.874 --> 07:46.807
A desire.

07:48.745 --> 07:49.944
Speak.

07:51.848 --> 07:54.148
I was hoping, my Lord

07:56.886 --> 07:59.020
that you might grant me a request.

08:27.617 --> 08:28.749
Catania.

08:30.587 --> 08:32.753
She's the only person
that I've ever loved.

08:38.962 --> 08:42.996
If you would grant her life, so
that we could be together again

08:44.232 --> 08:46.267
I'll forever be in your service.

09:01.217 --> 09:03.451
Again. Faster.

09:09.425 --> 09:11.254
This is pointless.

09:11.261 --> 09:14.256
Get up. You have much to learn.

09:14.263 --> 09:16.126
We are not done yet.

09:16.132 --> 09:18.528
Why can't I just use magic to fight?

09:18.534 --> 09:20.864
Because magic is not a weapon.

09:20.870 --> 09:22.803
It must be used sparingly.

09:24.374 --> 09:25.836
- Magic...
- Yeah, I know.

09:25.842 --> 09:27.475
Magic always has a price.

09:29.112 --> 09:30.213
Again.

09:40.790 --> 09:42.823
Do you think that
becoming a Druid is easy?

09:44.394 --> 09:45.756
Understand this

09:45.762 --> 09:47.524
your life is no longer your own.

09:47.530 --> 09:49.645
You'll be at service
to the Four Lands and...

09:58.908 --> 09:59.940
I'll get help.

10:00.443 --> 10:02.272
There's no point.

10:03.479 --> 10:05.575
When I defeated the Dagda Mor

10:05.581 --> 10:08.178
I should have sequestered myself
into Druid's sleep

10:08.184 --> 10:09.746
to replenish my magic.

10:11.087 --> 10:12.253
But I couldn't.

10:13.022 --> 10:14.689
I had to find Bandon.

10:16.225 --> 10:18.926
The sleep, it takes years

10:20.596 --> 10:22.626
even decades.

10:22.632 --> 10:24.298
What happens if you
don't take the sleep?

10:30.707 --> 10:32.202
You die, don't you?

11:06.127 --> 11:07.956
Maybe we can work out a deal.

11:11.199 --> 11:13.399
Buy you a few more hours of your life.

11:22.477 --> 11:24.172
You're dead, Rover!

11:24.178 --> 11:25.911
You'll have to catch me first.

11:51.005 --> 11:52.434
We don't have much time.

11:52.440 --> 11:54.269
I don't know how to thank you.

11:54.275 --> 11:56.575
Don't thank me yet. They'll be back.

12:03.518 --> 12:04.913
What now?

12:04.919 --> 12:07.482
We need to get you to
the tunnels below Arborlon.

12:07.488 --> 12:08.717
You'll be safe there.

12:08.723 --> 12:09.855
Keep up with me.

12:52.934 --> 12:54.400
It's working.

13:23.097 --> 13:24.159
Where am I?

13:24.165 --> 13:25.326
Catania.

13:29.170 --> 13:30.369
Catania, look at me.

13:31.806 --> 13:32.990
It's okay.

13:35.309 --> 13:36.475
It's okay.

13:38.079 --> 13:39.211
You?

13:40.347 --> 13:41.775
- It's okay.
- Get away from me!

13:41.782 --> 13:43.445
- It's okay. It's okay!
- No!

13:43.451 --> 13:45.037
- I'm not going to hurt you.
- No!

13:45.686 --> 13:46.746
Okay?

13:48.547 --> 13:49.751
I know...

13:50.623 --> 13:52.185
I know what you must think of me.

13:53.653 --> 13:54.685
And I'm sorry.

13:55.630 --> 13:56.829
Forgive me.

13:59.033 --> 14:00.899
I'd rather be dead than be with you.

14:03.604 --> 14:05.638
I never meant to hurt you.

14:06.641 --> 14:07.843
Enough.

14:09.677 --> 14:10.709
Enough.

14:12.813 --> 14:14.079
Come to me.

14:26.527 --> 14:27.893
What have you done?

14:32.066 --> 14:33.499
Catania.

14:48.449 --> 14:49.581
Get away from her!

14:58.092 --> 15:00.388
When my sword struck the Warlock blade

15:00.394 --> 15:02.294
it revealed the truth
of what's gonna happen.

15:03.664 --> 15:06.031
I saw flashes of them all dying.

15:08.602 --> 15:10.969
Eretria returning to the darkness

15:12.173 --> 15:14.373
Allanon and Mareth, covered in blood.

15:21.115 --> 15:23.082
I was helpless to stop it.

15:24.118 --> 15:26.452
I could feel myself
being pulled under water

15:27.188 --> 15:28.650
the whole world going cold.

15:28.656 --> 15:31.186
- Wil...
- Look, the truth is

15:31.192 --> 15:33.225
I fail. It's as simple as that.

15:33.794 --> 15:34.893
I've seen it.

15:36.063 --> 15:37.162
I've felt it.

15:48.175 --> 15:50.442
Nothing about the truth is simple.

15:52.224 --> 15:54.075
The sword broke
when your truth was revealed

15:54.081 --> 15:55.814
because you weren't ready to face it.

15:59.320 --> 16:00.753
What truth is that?

16:03.758 --> 16:04.790
Wil.

16:25.646 --> 16:26.945
Dad?

16:30.249 --> 16:31.945
What are you doing here?

16:31.951 --> 16:33.551
I'm here to help you face your truth.

16:34.987 --> 16:36.187
My truth.

16:37.990 --> 16:40.024
My truth is, I'm no hero.

16:41.627 --> 16:44.458
I don't save anyone. I'm not you.

16:44.464 --> 16:46.163
You're a better man than me, Wil.

16:46.966 --> 16:49.433
Me? No.

16:50.303 --> 16:52.370
You're the legendary Shea Ohmsford

16:53.239 --> 16:55.005
hero of the War of the Races.

16:57.677 --> 16:59.777
Don't you ever wonder
why I became a drunk?

17:00.813 --> 17:02.542
Why I died alone in that cave?

17:02.548 --> 17:04.515
It was because
I was a failure living a lie.

17:06.618 --> 17:07.681
To defeat the Warlock Lord

17:07.686 --> 17:09.887
I had to risk
making the ultimate sacrifice.

17:10.823 --> 17:11.955
I couldn't.

17:12.959 --> 17:14.458
The thought of leaving Heady behind

17:15.762 --> 17:16.961
and never having you

17:17.730 --> 17:19.085
was too much.

17:19.663 --> 17:22.465
I was ashamed to be alive because
I couldn't face my truth.

17:25.204 --> 17:26.804
Don't make that same mistake.

17:47.026 --> 17:48.855
You have information about the Druid?

17:48.861 --> 17:50.094
Yes, General.

17:51.330 --> 17:55.028
He was brought into Storlock
several days ago, badly wounded.

17:55.034 --> 17:56.233
And who brought him in?

17:57.036 --> 17:58.169
His daughter.

17:59.772 --> 18:01.368
His daughter?

18:01.374 --> 18:03.641
They say she has powers, too, sir.

18:05.244 --> 18:07.474
Why would they come to Storlock?

18:07.480 --> 18:09.176
The Druids have no use for medicine.

18:09.182 --> 18:12.183
Uh, the Elder Stor was keeping
something for him.

18:13.453 --> 18:14.785
Something called a Codex.

18:18.891 --> 18:20.658
And why should I believe you?

18:26.399 --> 18:28.766
This is what the demons did to me.

18:30.970 --> 18:32.536
I want things back the way they were

18:33.706 --> 18:35.306
before magic.

18:38.377 --> 18:39.677
They will be, brother.

18:50.890 --> 18:52.786
I...

18:52.792 --> 18:54.158
I thank you, General.

19:02.068 --> 19:03.634
We ride for Storlock.

19:20.019 --> 19:21.552
What's gonna happen when you're gone?

19:24.924 --> 19:26.757
You'll become the last of the Druids.

19:27.960 --> 19:29.493
Protector of magic.

19:31.464 --> 19:34.064
But the Druid's path is solitary.

19:34.867 --> 19:36.200
You'll have to walk alone.

19:36.954 --> 19:38.330
I'm not afraid of being alone.

19:39.372 --> 19:41.672
Fear is the least of it, Mareth.

19:42.842 --> 19:44.604
Even if the Warlock Lord is defeated...

19:44.610 --> 19:46.306
You mean when
the Warlock Lord is defeated.

19:46.312 --> 19:47.545
Even then.

19:48.281 --> 19:49.613
You'll be forced to watch

19:50.182 --> 19:51.782
everybody you care about

19:52.652 --> 19:55.553
grow old and die.

19:57.123 --> 19:58.789
I'll do what I have to do.

20:00.459 --> 20:02.155
Your feelings for Wil Ohmsford.

20:04.163 --> 20:06.026
They've grown strong.

20:06.032 --> 20:09.062
And this is an obstacle
you'll be forced to overcome.

20:09.068 --> 20:10.568
You don't have to worry about that.

20:14.407 --> 20:16.106
Love can cloud your judgment

20:16.909 --> 20:18.309
and make you vulnerable.

20:19.345 --> 20:21.312
It puts everybody around you at peril.

20:23.649 --> 20:27.213
A Druid must learn to face the future

20:27.219 --> 20:29.082
without emotional attachment.

20:31.691 --> 20:32.823
Like you?

20:34.215 --> 20:35.614
Did you ever love my mother?

20:38.529 --> 20:41.526
Your mother was beautiful and brilliant.

20:41.533 --> 20:43.467
She could have lived
the life of a princess.

20:44.637 --> 20:46.437
But she was also determined

20:47.220 --> 20:48.353
and stubborn.

20:49.600 --> 20:50.999
She chose a higher calling.

20:54.037 --> 20:56.571
One of learning and knowledge.

21:03.046 --> 21:04.746
I miss her so much.

21:08.085 --> 21:09.484
As do I.

21:10.320 --> 21:11.720
Every single day.

21:13.123 --> 21:15.757
No, you didn't answer
my question though.

21:16.994 --> 21:18.326
Did you love her?

21:19.359 --> 21:20.571
Your mother

21:21.899 --> 21:24.102
was the only woman I have ever loved.

21:26.436 --> 21:28.069
And that love weakened me.

21:30.974 --> 21:32.541
I need to rest.

21:34.444 --> 21:35.877
Go.

21:36.680 --> 21:37.879
But...

21:38.682 --> 21:41.082
Please, go.

22:05.842 --> 22:07.409
Don't slow down. We're almost there.

22:12.849 --> 22:13.945
Keep running!

22:23.427 --> 22:24.996
No one outruns the Crimson.

22:52.240 --> 22:53.439
This is where I belong.

22:55.543 --> 22:56.675
Being a healer.

22:58.613 --> 23:00.379
It's all I ever wanted to be.

23:01.682 --> 23:03.282
Not a hero.

23:04.552 --> 23:05.618
Not a savior.

23:07.054 --> 23:08.387
A simple life.

23:08.923 --> 23:10.222
Before the Elfstones

23:10.958 --> 23:12.358
and magic and Allanon.

23:14.362 --> 23:15.728
But that's not our destiny, is it?

23:19.267 --> 23:20.733
And now your the world's only hope.

23:24.872 --> 23:28.073
How do I destroy the Warlock
Lord so he never comes back?

23:29.410 --> 23:31.710
You must sink the blade
straight through his heart.

23:34.315 --> 23:35.714
What if I can't, what if I fail?

23:36.450 --> 23:38.380
You're a Shannara.

23:38.386 --> 23:42.450
The magic of your ancestors
runs through your blood.

23:42.456 --> 23:45.253
It can defeat the Warlock Lord
and cleanse the world of evil

23:45.259 --> 23:48.394
but only if you accept your destiny
and make peace with your past.

23:49.563 --> 23:51.030
You and I are good now.

23:53.067 --> 23:54.533
There's one more you must face.

24:30.905 --> 24:32.033
Run!

24:32.039 --> 24:33.268
Go to the tunnel.

25:11.145 --> 25:12.778
Why do you think we're still alive?

25:13.948 --> 25:15.180
My guess?

25:16.217 --> 25:18.780
Riga has a thing for theater.

25:18.786 --> 25:20.686
Drawing out the kills for show.

25:48.482 --> 25:49.782
Tell me something, Slanter.

25:52.257 --> 25:54.296
Is there anyone that'll miss you
when you're gone?

25:54.922 --> 25:57.389
A wife? Kids?

26:00.022 --> 26:01.922
The Gnome tribe are my only family.

26:04.899 --> 26:06.127
What about you?

26:09.537 --> 26:11.136
There's no one left to miss me.

26:12.540 --> 26:14.706
It makes it easier, I suppose.

26:17.845 --> 26:19.178
That was the plan.

26:21.015 --> 26:22.247
But now

26:23.784 --> 26:25.684
I'm not so sure that was
the best strategy.

26:27.154 --> 26:29.388
To leave behind nothing
but ghosts and regrets

26:31.392 --> 26:33.926
to die with a heart
that's never known love

26:35.629 --> 26:37.229
what kind of life is that?

26:54.448 --> 26:55.514
Druid!

27:21.842 --> 27:22.975
General Riga.

27:25.713 --> 27:27.751
I believe I have something
that belongs to you.

27:41.162 --> 27:43.395
And I'd thought that might
get your attention.

27:44.832 --> 27:47.733
Bring me the Codex,
or your daughter dies.

28:13.627 --> 28:14.956
Look at what you've done to her.

28:14.962 --> 28:17.712
Look at what she's done to you.

28:27.074 --> 28:29.107
She is nothing.

28:29.910 --> 28:31.043
She is everything.

28:35.749 --> 28:37.549
She never loved you.

28:41.322 --> 28:45.013
Nobody has ever loved

28:45.392 --> 28:46.525
you.

28:56.437 --> 28:59.838
Love is an illusion.

29:01.809 --> 29:04.910
You must empty your heart.

29:06.547 --> 29:09.715
You must free your mind.

29:20.127 --> 29:22.261
You must kill your desire.

29:24.164 --> 29:26.098
No. No.

29:27.668 --> 29:28.900
I can't.

29:30.137 --> 29:32.704
Darkness does not serve us,

29:34.975 --> 29:37.376
we serve darkness.

29:41.282 --> 29:42.581
Please.

29:46.654 --> 29:48.287
Prove yourself.

30:01.802 --> 30:03.500
Bandon, my love

30:56.690 --> 30:59.524
Now you can walk by my side.

31:10.142 --> 31:12.939
Always thought I'd take my
last breath on the battlefield.

31:12.945 --> 31:16.509
Not with my hands tied and thrown
over a dam like last night's trash.

31:16.515 --> 31:19.362
Guess I should've learned how to swim.

31:33.332 --> 31:34.794
How're you boys holding up?

31:34.800 --> 31:36.563
Much better, thanks to you.

31:36.569 --> 31:39.466
I assume my men were able to break
into the palace with your help.

31:39.472 --> 31:40.734
That's right.

31:40.740 --> 31:42.502
We have to move fast.

31:42.508 --> 31:43.670
What's the plan?

31:43.676 --> 31:45.605
The service tunnels
that run beneath the dam.

31:45.611 --> 31:47.807
They'll get you
out of the city undetected.

31:47.813 --> 31:50.410
I'll escort you to the entrance,
then you're on your own.

31:50.416 --> 31:53.200
If the Crimson find out you're helping
us, you know you're a dead man.

31:53.207 --> 31:55.015
That's a risk I'm willing to take.

31:55.021 --> 31:57.488
For a Gnome and a bounty hunter,
you barely know.

31:59.025 --> 32:00.687
Queen Tamlin was good to me.

32:00.693 --> 32:03.023
It's the least I can do
to honor her memory.

32:03.029 --> 32:05.295
All I ask is that you find Lyria
and protect her.

32:07.867 --> 32:08.899
You have my word.

32:09.702 --> 32:10.768
Come on.

32:12.238 --> 32:13.604
Follow me.

32:33.059 --> 32:34.124
No.

32:39.282 --> 32:40.551
At last.

32:42.068 --> 32:44.364
You should have let me die.

32:44.370 --> 32:46.433
You're a shadow
of your former self, Druid.

32:46.439 --> 32:48.205
Not at all the man I met in Graymark.

32:49.008 --> 32:50.836
You said you would let her go.

32:50.843 --> 32:52.172
Are you really that naive?

32:52.178 --> 32:55.111
She's as guilty as you are
and will share the same fate.

32:59.852 --> 33:01.614
Thank you for this.

33:01.620 --> 33:03.821
You have no idea what you're up against.

33:05.544 --> 33:06.709
With your death,

33:06.716 --> 33:10.060
I am one step closer to purging
the Four Lands of magic.

33:12.458 --> 33:13.459
General,

33:13.466 --> 33:15.462
there has been no word from Graymark.

33:15.468 --> 33:18.569
I sent men to investigate
but they have yet to return.

33:19.872 --> 33:21.305
I'm afraid there's been a breach.

33:25.478 --> 33:27.010
We leave for Graymark at once.

33:29.415 --> 33:31.254
Burn the Druid and his
daughter at the stake

33:31.261 --> 33:32.811
then scatter their ashes in the wind.

33:32.818 --> 33:34.351
I want nothing left.

34:05.050 --> 34:06.416
It's still broken.

34:14.025 --> 34:15.391
I have to face you.

34:17.096 --> 34:18.395
You're my last truth.

34:42.254 --> 34:43.453
You're gone.

34:45.090 --> 34:46.657
And you're never coming back.

34:48.393 --> 34:50.690
I have to let you go once and for all.

34:50.696 --> 34:51.995
That's right.

34:53.933 --> 34:55.431
And nothing can bring me back.

34:58.938 --> 35:00.437
She loved you, Wil.

35:08.147 --> 35:10.109
And I loved her.

35:10.115 --> 35:11.985
But that moment in time has passed.

35:12.751 --> 35:13.784
You did it.

35:49.378 --> 35:51.111
Garrison!

36:07.729 --> 36:09.129
Who are you?

36:10.799 --> 36:11.898
Take him!

36:46.935 --> 36:48.368
Warlock Lord.

36:49.905 --> 36:51.037
Bow.

36:55.577 --> 36:57.773
You have no power over me.

36:57.779 --> 37:01.143
I am impervious to your magic.
And I will not stop

37:01.149 --> 37:03.846
until it's purged from this land.

37:03.852 --> 37:06.186
You may be impervious to magic,

37:06.922 --> 37:08.455
but not to me.

37:35.549 --> 37:38.379
Mortals are always blind

37:38.386 --> 37:41.016
to magic's true power.

37:43.024 --> 37:46.822
The Four Lands will not
be purged of magic.

37:55.537 --> 37:58.968
It will be consumed by it.

38:17.759 --> 38:19.321
Tell me

38:19.327 --> 38:22.262
did the bitch Queen litter any children?

38:23.698 --> 38:24.831
A daughter.

38:25.567 --> 38:26.833
Princess Lyria.

38:28.003 --> 38:29.936
Then we must find her

38:30.805 --> 38:33.206
for she is the key to Heaven's Well.

38:35.343 --> 38:36.609
Come.

38:37.179 --> 38:39.012
We have work to do.

39:15.654 --> 39:16.775
Eretria!

39:18.987 --> 39:20.249
Eretria.

39:24.693 --> 39:27.093
What took you so long, Short Tips?

39:28.029 --> 39:29.091
What happened?

39:29.097 --> 39:30.163
You all right?

39:32.467 --> 39:33.729
Yeah.

39:33.735 --> 39:35.078
I'm fine.

39:35.875 --> 39:37.708
The Crimson on the other hand...

39:39.074 --> 39:40.940
The rest of The Chosen? Are they safe?

39:41.543 --> 39:42.575
Yes.

39:52.220 --> 39:54.817
Did you see Amberle? What did she say?

39:54.823 --> 39:56.055
I'll tell you on the way.

39:57.859 --> 39:59.622
We've gotta meet the others
at the enclave.

39:59.628 --> 40:01.094
There's no time to lose.

40:24.419 --> 40:25.818
This is all my fault.

40:26.454 --> 40:28.017
No.

40:28.023 --> 40:30.757
Yes. You only gave Riga
the Codex to protect me.

40:34.288 --> 40:38.033
You are more important to me
than any book.

40:45.340 --> 40:47.473
Will your magic save you now, Druid?
