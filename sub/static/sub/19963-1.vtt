¶¶

00:04.038 --> 00:06.872
(theme music playing)

00:09.010 --> 00:12.311
<i> ¶ I got the wind in my hair</i>
<i> and a fire within ¶</i>

00:12.313 --> 00:14.446
<i> ¶ 'Cause there's</i>
<i> something beginning ¶</i>

00:14.448 --> 00:20.119
<i> ¶ I got a mystery to solve</i>
<i> and excitement to spare ¶</i>

00:20.121 --> 00:22.688
<i> ¶ Got a beautiful breeze</i>

00:22.690 --> 00:27.793
<i> ¶ I'm ready to follow it</i>

00:27.795 --> 00:30.662
<i> ¶ And I'll get there I swear ¶</i>

00:30.664 --> 00:34.233
<i> ¶ With the wind in my hair ¶</i>

00:50.751 --> 00:51.850
Boo!

00:51.852 --> 00:54.720
-(laughs)
-(growls)

00:56.157 --> 00:57.222
Pffffft!

01:06.333 --> 01:07.633
(laughs awkwardly)

01:09.070 --> 01:10.269
(gasps)

01:11.839 --> 01:13.272
Gothel:
Hello, Rapunzel.

01:14.842 --> 01:17.242
Did you think
I was gone forever?

01:18.879 --> 01:20.446
What's the matter, dear?

01:20.448 --> 01:22.981
Aren't you happy
to see your mummy?

01:26.253 --> 01:28.120
(screams)

01:28.122 --> 01:29.188
(screams)

01:31.358 --> 01:33.292
(grunting)

01:34.562 --> 01:37.729
Gothel:
And look!
Your hair has returned!

01:37.731 --> 01:40.099
Ooh, isn't that wonderful?

01:40.101 --> 01:42.801
Come now, dear.
Let's get back
to your tower,

01:42.803 --> 01:45.804
where you will be safe
and secure.

01:45.806 --> 01:48.841
-Rapunzel!
-(gasps)

01:49.944 --> 01:51.009
(squeaks)

01:52.980 --> 01:55.914
-(seagulls cawing)
-(bells pealing)

01:55.916 --> 01:57.149
-Fred?
-Huh?

01:57.151 --> 01:58.383
You haven't touched
your food.

01:58.385 --> 02:00.752
No, no, I--
I've touched it.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.821
I moved my eggs
from here

02:02.823 --> 02:04.223
to here, you see? Hm.

02:04.225 --> 02:06.325
Oh, sweetheart,
it's been nearly a week.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.960
Just talk to her.

02:07.962 --> 02:10.896
(sighs)
You do recall
my last conversation

02:10.898 --> 02:13.298
with Rapunzel
didn't go quite
as I had hoped?

02:13.300 --> 02:17.269
Uh, Fred, you confined her
to the walls of Corona
under martial law.

02:17.271 --> 02:21.507
If that's a daddy-daughter
conversation, I would hate
to see what a talking-to is.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.342
Just because
it was a difficult choice,

02:23.344 --> 02:25.577
doesn't mean
it wasn't the right one.

02:25.579 --> 02:29.414
Come on, Cass!
Those dreams are trying
to tell me something!

02:29.416 --> 02:31.650
-Ever since that night--
-Shh!

02:31.652 --> 02:34.686
Raps, I told you,
we can't tell anyone
about that night.

02:34.688 --> 02:38.323
Um... I think the secret's
pretty much out.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.292
Yeah, yeah, everyone knows
the hair's back,

02:40.294 --> 02:44.129
but if anyone knew
I was the one who snuck you out
when it happened,

02:44.131 --> 02:45.831
I would be sent to a convent--

02:45.833 --> 02:48.367
literally, a convent.

02:48.369 --> 02:50.335
Well, I have to tell Eugene.

02:50.337 --> 02:53.305
No, no, no, no, no.
As far as he knows,

02:53.307 --> 02:56.041
you just woke up
that morning with long hair.

02:56.043 --> 02:57.943
But Eugene is my boyfriend!

02:57.945 --> 02:59.378
We tell each other everything!

02:59.380 --> 03:03.015
I know this is a lot to ask,
but I can't risk it.

03:03.017 --> 03:05.350
Please, don't tell Eugene.

03:05.352 --> 03:08.320
Tell Eugene what?
Oh, come on, you guys
keeping secrets?

03:08.322 --> 03:11.890
It's not really a secret,
Eugene, it's more like a...

03:11.892 --> 03:13.492
sensitive situation.

03:13.494 --> 03:17.029
Sensit-- S-- Ha! Sensitive?

03:17.031 --> 03:19.531
And you think Cassandra's
gonna help?

03:19.533 --> 03:22.868
Blondie, I've met glaciers
with more warmth and compassion.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.204
And move faster, she's slow.

03:25.206 --> 03:28.473
Rapunzel, it's me, Eugene.
Whatever's going on
you can tell me.

03:28.475 --> 03:30.809
-I know I can, it's--
-Cassandra: I don't trust you!

03:30.811 --> 03:32.411
You have a big mouth!

03:32.413 --> 03:34.413
(gasps)
I do not!

03:34.415 --> 03:36.315
Name one time
I blew a secret.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.352
It's a scarf!

03:40.354 --> 03:43.589
Thanks, this was fun!
And to think we were
dreading it, right?

03:45.593 --> 03:47.492
-Surprise!
-(screams)

03:47.494 --> 03:49.261
Oh, your surprise party
is next week.

03:49.263 --> 03:50.329
(groans)

03:50.331 --> 03:51.863
I said one time!

03:51.865 --> 03:54.600
Rapunzel, you're really
not gonna tell me?

03:54.602 --> 03:55.901
I'm sorry.

03:55.903 --> 03:59.404
Fine. But you should know,
I have things I keep from you.

03:59.406 --> 04:01.306
-Lots of things.
-Name one.

04:02.543 --> 04:05.611
Pete, the guard,
is terrified of mimes.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.279
Hey!

04:07.281 --> 04:09.414
They see things
that aren't there!

04:14.722 --> 04:15.887
Pete, wait!

04:15.889 --> 04:18.290
No, it was a different
Pete the guard.

04:18.292 --> 04:19.591
You don't even know him.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.426
(jaunty piano music playing)

04:22.963 --> 04:24.563
Ahh! There they are!

04:24.565 --> 04:26.932
A veritable cornucopia
of confidants,

04:26.934 --> 04:31.036
who trust me implicitly
and would gladly divulge
their innermost secrets.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.271
Wait, who is this guy?

04:32.273 --> 04:34.239
That's Hook Hand's brother.

04:34.241 --> 04:37.542
Oh, yeah?
What's your name?
Hook Foot?

04:38.612 --> 04:40.746
I gotta admit,
I did not see that coming.

04:40.748 --> 04:42.614
So, where is Hook Hand, anyway?

04:42.616 --> 04:44.116
There.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.617
Eugene:
Hook Hand went
on a world tour?

04:45.619 --> 04:47.919
Does no one
share anything with me?

04:47.921 --> 04:51.156
No feelings,
no secrets, no news?

04:51.158 --> 04:54.726
Why won't anyone
open up to me?

04:54.728 --> 04:56.061
(sniffing)

04:56.063 --> 04:57.629
Ahhh!

04:57.631 --> 05:00.232
Big Nose! Now there's a guy
who knows how to share

05:00.234 --> 05:01.833
what's on his nose-- mind!

05:01.835 --> 05:03.602
Here comes loverboy

05:03.604 --> 05:06.571
with more
of his romantic "excapades."

05:06.573 --> 05:08.473
Hey, are those flowers
for Assunta?

05:08.475 --> 05:09.775
Am I pronouncing
that correctly?

05:09.777 --> 05:11.643
How is your lady friend, anyway?

05:11.645 --> 05:13.312
Oh, I'm glad you asked,

05:13.314 --> 05:15.781
but perhaps this latest poem
I wrote will tell you.

05:15.783 --> 05:17.182
(groans)

05:17.184 --> 05:21.119
I call it,
"Can You Keep a Secret?
I Love You."

05:21.121 --> 05:23.522
"Our love
is like a timeless truth,

05:23.524 --> 05:25.524
"It knows
no tick nor tock.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.826
-"Our love is
a big toe of honesty..."
-(men growl)

05:27.828 --> 05:31.363
Big Nose:
"...Poking through the hole
of your favorite... sock."

05:31.365 --> 05:33.031
Cassandra:
I was thinking
about your hair.

05:33.033 --> 05:36.134
Maybe there's a way
we can discreetly try
to get some answers,

05:36.136 --> 05:37.703
just the two of us.

05:37.705 --> 05:39.271
I might know someone
who can help.

05:39.273 --> 05:41.540
I still think
you're being unfair
about Eugene.

05:41.542 --> 05:44.509
But, um,
who is this friend of yours?

05:44.511 --> 05:48.647
His name is Varian,
and he's some kind
of wizard.

05:48.649 --> 05:51.450
(gasps)
Wow! A real wizard?

05:51.452 --> 05:52.818
(squealing)

05:52.820 --> 05:54.152
Do you think he'll have
one of those pointy hats,

05:54.154 --> 05:57.456
and, like, a robe
and a staff and cast spells?

05:57.458 --> 05:58.657
No, I do not.

05:58.659 --> 05:59.725
(sighs)

05:59.727 --> 06:01.560
Very little is known
about Varian,
and what is,

06:01.562 --> 06:02.661
isn't good.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.196
Some say he's dangerous.

06:04.198 --> 06:06.832
But if we want answers,
he's our best bet. Right?

06:06.834 --> 06:08.533
Mm-hm.

06:08.535 --> 06:13.071
(sighs) Well, sounds like
we have a wizard to visit.

06:13.073 --> 06:15.374
"We keep no secrets,
me and you,

06:15.376 --> 06:18.810
Our love stays fresh
like the morning... dew."

06:18.812 --> 06:21.146
You see, what I really
tried to do is capture

06:21.148 --> 06:23.682
-the oneness
of our relationship.
-(whinnies)

06:23.684 --> 06:26.485
-Yep, oneness, got it.
-Big Nose: 'Cause if you
can't share everything

06:26.487 --> 06:27.652
with that someone special,

06:27.654 --> 06:31.056
then maybe that someone
isn't so special.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.392
Ha-ha! I gotta go.
This has been great.

06:33.394 --> 06:34.559
You keep writin'
those words down,

06:34.561 --> 06:38.029
'cause one of these days...
you'll have more of 'em.

06:38.031 --> 06:39.331
Okay, bye, everybody!

06:39.333 --> 06:42.334
(snorts)
Good morning!

06:42.336 --> 06:44.903
Hey, Big Nose,
what's goin' on
with that lady

06:44.905 --> 06:46.671
that you have?

06:46.673 --> 06:47.873
(clearing throat)

06:47.875 --> 06:49.341
(others groan)

06:55.582 --> 06:58.083
Cassandra:
So, this is where
Varian lives.

06:58.085 --> 07:01.620
It seems cozy,
in a I-wish-I-had-
said-goodbye-

07:01.622 --> 07:03.889
to-my-loved-ones-
before-I-left
kind of way.

07:03.891 --> 07:06.458
(rumbling)

07:06.460 --> 07:08.493
(squeaking)

07:12.766 --> 07:14.733
Cassandra:
Just watch
your step, Raps.

07:14.735 --> 07:15.667
Come on,
this way.

07:16.703 --> 07:19.504
It's just fog.
I'm sure it's okay.

07:25.312 --> 07:26.745
(screams)

07:26.747 --> 07:29.247
(both coughing)

07:29.249 --> 07:31.316
Fine. A booby trap!

07:31.318 --> 07:33.185
-Raps,
everything's gonna be-- oh!
-(footsteps approach)

07:34.721 --> 07:38.123
(distorted,
speaks emphatically)
What do you want?

07:41.161 --> 07:42.694
(horses grunting)

07:43.664 --> 07:45.230
What are they doing?

07:46.400 --> 07:48.633
Um... hi.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.469
So sorry
to bother you, sir.

07:50.471 --> 07:53.271
I... wanted to ask you
about my hair.

07:53.273 --> 07:54.906
Because you're such
a magic exp--

07:54.908 --> 07:59.110
(distorted)
Magic? I do not work
with magic.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.745
(normal voice)
I mean, technically,
it's not magic.

08:00.747 --> 08:03.515
it's alchemy,
but-- yeah-- don't--
don't sweat it.

08:03.517 --> 08:04.683
(growls)

08:04.685 --> 08:05.984
(nervous laugh)
Got it.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.752
So, what is this?

08:07.754 --> 08:11.189
Oh, it's-- it's
a chemical compound
of my own design.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.792
Thank you.
See, we have a bit
of a critter problem

08:13.794 --> 08:16.828
out here,
and, through the miracle
of modern alchemy,

08:16.830 --> 08:19.831
I have found a humane way
to solve the problem.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.834
This is riveting,
but could you get us
out of here?

08:22.836 --> 08:25.437
Ha! Where is
that neutralizing parti--

08:25.439 --> 08:27.339
oh! C-Come--
get outta here!

08:30.677 --> 08:33.845
(laughs)
I am so sorry,
Your Highness.

08:33.847 --> 08:37.549
"Your Highness"? Wait.
You know who I am?

08:37.551 --> 08:38.850
Uh, how could I not?

08:38.852 --> 08:40.986
(laughs)
Look at your hair!

08:40.988 --> 08:42.554
Ha! Your highness.

08:42.556 --> 08:44.856
-(clears throat)
-Oh, please.

08:44.858 --> 08:45.957
Just Rapunzel.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.792
Wow. Really? Okay.

08:47.794 --> 08:50.529
So, fantastical stories
of your hair returning
have spread

08:50.531 --> 08:53.832
throughout Corona.
Yeah, people say it's magic,
but personally,

08:53.834 --> 08:56.301
I don't really believe that.
Now, as you have
probably guessed,

08:56.303 --> 08:57.736
I am a man of science,

08:57.738 --> 09:00.038
-specifically, al--
-Alchemy. We know.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.840
Now listen, kid.
We need your help,

09:01.842 --> 09:03.041
but let me
make something clear.

09:03.043 --> 09:06.578
What happens here
stays here, you got it?

09:06.580 --> 09:11.616
Oh, yes, this-- this--
ah-- is-- it's very...

09:13.153 --> 09:14.386
long.

09:14.388 --> 09:17.822
Oh, no, don't worry,
Your High-- Rapunzel.

09:17.824 --> 09:20.525
I am sure that I, Varian,

09:20.527 --> 09:22.494
can unlock the mystery
of your hair

09:22.496 --> 09:24.763
with the power of science!

09:24.765 --> 09:26.798
Ow!

09:26.799 --> 09:28.832
Heh. No sweat, it's just
a little... (babbles)

09:30.103 --> 09:32.871
(Eugene groans)
What is taking 'em
so long?

09:32.873 --> 09:34.940
I'm goin' in!

09:34.942 --> 09:36.675
(grunts)

09:38.445 --> 09:40.145
(whinnying)

09:43.917 --> 09:44.783
(whinnying)

09:48.088 --> 09:50.855
(chittering)

09:50.857 --> 09:52.824
(grunting)

09:55.395 --> 09:58.763
Rapunzel:
<i> ¶ Bring back</i>
<i> what once was mine ¶</i>

09:58.765 --> 10:03.969
<i> ¶ What once was mine ¶</i>

10:05.105 --> 10:06.204
Better?

10:06.206 --> 10:07.272
Oh, yeah-- No!

10:07.274 --> 10:09.407
Huh... that used to work.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.977
Well, silver lining:
we've acquired some
critical data

10:11.979 --> 10:16.214
about your hair.
It no longer possesses
its legendary healing power.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.984
Progress!
Now let's figure out

10:18.986 --> 10:22.954
exactly what this hair
is made of.

10:24.558 --> 10:26.958
This machine can analyze
any substance

10:26.960 --> 10:28.960
for chemical makeup,
bitopic composition,

10:28.962 --> 10:31.262
and urgu-structural integrity.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.565
-I built it myself.
-Nice!

10:33.567 --> 10:36.468
If I'm right,
this should tell us
all there is know

10:36.470 --> 10:37.636
about your hair.

10:37.638 --> 10:39.638
Raps, are you sure
you wanna--

10:39.640 --> 10:41.806
-Rapunzel?
-Let's do this.

10:41.808 --> 10:47.112
Okay! Rapunzel.
Now, um, this may
get a little--

10:47.114 --> 10:48.480
Exciting?

10:49.449 --> 10:51.983
Um, sure! Yeah!
That's a good word for it.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.185
(whirring)

10:55.922 --> 10:57.956
Whaa!

10:57.958 --> 10:59.024
Whoa-kay!

10:59.026 --> 11:01.426
Whaaa! Whoa!

11:02.462 --> 11:04.029
Ho-ho.

11:04.031 --> 11:04.929
(bell dings)

11:04.931 --> 11:06.631
Varian:
And there
we are! Done.

11:06.633 --> 11:09.334
All right.
Not super fun,
but it's over.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.802
(laughs nervously)

11:10.804 --> 11:14.506
Ha! Oh, sorry.
Yeah, I-- I meant done
with the first test.

11:14.508 --> 11:16.941
But don't worry,
only 86 more to go!

11:16.943 --> 11:18.043
(machine starting up)

11:19.212 --> 11:21.212
(blade whirring)

11:23.016 --> 11:24.049
(gasps)

11:24.051 --> 11:24.949
Blondie!

11:24.951 --> 11:26.885
Amazing!

11:26.887 --> 11:29.220
You were right,
it's absolutely unbreakable!

11:29.222 --> 11:31.456
-(door bangs)
-But I'm betting you're not!

11:31.458 --> 11:33.725
Let her go!

11:33.727 --> 11:35.860
Eugene! Hey!

11:35.862 --> 11:37.162
Blondie! You're okay!

11:37.164 --> 11:38.930
You wanna tell me
what's goin' on here?

11:42.069 --> 11:43.234
(laughs nervously)

11:43.236 --> 11:44.335
You know what?
I don't care.

11:44.337 --> 11:45.370
I'm gettin' you outta there.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.872
Hey! You're Flynn Rider!

11:47.874 --> 11:49.240
No. You don't know
what you're talking about.

11:49.242 --> 11:50.709
I've never seen you before
in my life.

11:50.711 --> 11:51.876
You can't prove anything!

11:51.878 --> 11:55.880
(laughs nervously)
I'm your biggest fan!

11:55.882 --> 11:56.981
See?

11:58.051 --> 12:01.086
Hey, now!
Flynn Rider,
nice to be met.

12:01.088 --> 12:02.554
I used to see
your wanted posters
all the time!

12:02.556 --> 12:04.022
You're my hero!

12:04.024 --> 12:06.858
Oh, well, "hero" is a bit much.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.593
I've read every single book
about you!

12:08.595 --> 12:12.230
Oh... well, um, you see,
that's not actually me.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.499
I just took the name
from the book.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.835
Hey, hey!
Remember the time
you dueled that evil knight,

12:16.837 --> 12:18.002
blindfolded?

12:18.004 --> 12:21.439
No, no, not me.
Do you wanna
put that down?

12:21.441 --> 12:24.909
This isn't right, Cassandra.
I have to tell him
what's going on.

12:24.911 --> 12:29.180
No. Rapunzel, I want
to trust you, and I trust
that you trust Eugene,

12:29.182 --> 12:31.683
but I don't trust Eugene,
and if I can't trust Eugene,

12:31.685 --> 12:36.087
I can't trust you,
and you're just going
to have to trust me.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.722
Trust me, that logic tracks.

12:37.724 --> 12:40.125
Tell me about how you took on
the Earl of Camembert!

12:40.127 --> 12:41.559
Also not me.

12:41.561 --> 12:43.962
Would someone please
explain to me who this child is?

12:43.964 --> 12:45.096
I'm Varian!

12:45.098 --> 12:46.297
(glass shatters)

12:46.299 --> 12:47.999
Hot, hot, hot, hot!

12:49.736 --> 12:51.102
Oh, come on!

12:51.104 --> 12:53.972
(rumbling)

12:53.974 --> 12:55.140
What was that trembling?

12:55.142 --> 12:56.708
Trembling?
I didn't notice
any trembling.

12:56.710 --> 12:59.744
Oh! Yeah! Almost forgot
to get the spectrometric press!

12:59.746 --> 13:01.546
It's the only way
I can read the results
of the test!

13:01.548 --> 13:03.548
Flynn Rider!
Wanna come with?

13:03.550 --> 13:05.917
Oooh! No.

13:05.918 --> 13:08.285
Hey! If-- If-- If you come,
I can show you something
really special,

13:08.288 --> 13:11.055
but, um, you've got
to keep it a secret.

13:11.057 --> 13:13.224
You want to tell me a secret?

13:13.226 --> 13:16.060
Did you hear that, everyone?

13:16.062 --> 13:18.963
-Varitas-- V-- Var--
-Varian!

13:18.965 --> 13:22.834
A complete stranger
wants to tell me a secret!

13:27.274 --> 13:30.942
Listen, buddy, I need you
to tell me everything that
the princess told you.

13:30.944 --> 13:34.179
Oh, yeah. Well, okay,
first, she said, "We're looking
for Varian," and then I said,

13:34.181 --> 13:38.016
"I am Varian!" Ha!
And then she said,
"Uh, hi, sorry to bother you,

13:38.018 --> 13:39.651
sir, but I wanna ask you
about my hair."

13:39.653 --> 13:41.186
Wait, oh, I'm sorry,
let me back up.

13:41.188 --> 13:43.688
I forgot to tell you
about the raccoon trap.
So, there was--

13:43.690 --> 13:45.190
Yes, that's great,
but what I meant is,

13:45.192 --> 13:47.025
tell me all the important stuff
she said.

13:47.027 --> 13:50.628
Mr. Rider,
when the Princess of Corona
speaks directly to you,

13:50.630 --> 13:52.931
every word is important.

13:54.167 --> 13:57.202
(clattering)

13:57.204 --> 14:00.004
I know that press
is here somewhere, Flynn.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.706
Again, it's Eugene.

14:01.708 --> 14:04.876
Here it is!
And, once the tests are done,

14:04.878 --> 14:06.477
it'll print the results
on parchment paper--

14:06.479 --> 14:08.012
That's<i> muy interesante,</i>

14:08.014 --> 14:10.315
but getting back
to what the princess said--

14:10.317 --> 14:14.052
-(loud rumbling)
-Whoa, whoa!

14:14.054 --> 14:16.154
Why does that keep happening?

14:16.156 --> 14:20.325
Flynn Rider!
I believe I promised you...

14:20.327 --> 14:22.193
a secret.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.028
Now, if my dad knew
I was down here,

14:24.030 --> 14:26.798
he'd kill me. Heh.
Of course, if he knew
what I was actually doing

14:26.800 --> 14:28.166
down here, he'd probably
be impressed,

14:28.168 --> 14:30.668
or at least I hope
he'd be impressed.

14:30.670 --> 14:32.537
These tunnels
run through my entire village,

14:32.539 --> 14:35.073
which make them perfect
for my project.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.641
What project?

14:37.577 --> 14:39.077
This project.

14:40.814 --> 14:41.913
I don't get it.

14:41.915 --> 14:44.849
Through the miracle
of alchemy-- not magic--

14:44.851 --> 14:49.087
I have found a way
to heat this entire tank
of water with a single drop

14:49.089 --> 14:50.221
of my newest,
yet to be named

14:50.223 --> 14:54.692
compound...
which I'll call Flynnoelum!

14:54.694 --> 14:57.228
-I still don't get it.
-I'm gonna surprise my village

14:57.230 --> 15:00.198
by bringing the people
hot, running water!

15:00.200 --> 15:03.968
Ha-ha! I've constructed
five of these babies
all throughout the caverns.

15:03.970 --> 15:06.537
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait. These--
these tremors...

15:06.539 --> 15:08.106
your machines
are causing them?

15:08.108 --> 15:11.442
No, no, no.
My machines
are not causing them.

15:11.444 --> 15:14.245
The chemical reactions
they trigger do.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.413
(boom)

15:15.415 --> 15:17.248
And no one else knows
you're doing this?

15:17.250 --> 15:20.685
Okay, listen, kiddo.
I'm no expert in...

15:20.687 --> 15:23.254
whatever this is,
but anything

15:23.256 --> 15:26.024
that can cause earthquakes
cannot be safe.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.592
We've gotta warn people
about this.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.060
No! We can't!

15:29.062 --> 15:30.528
Okay? You gave me your word
you'd keep this a secret.

15:30.530 --> 15:34.933
And besides, I am an expert,
and this is all perfectly safe.

15:37.737 --> 15:40.104
Yeah, it does--
does that all the time.

15:42.108 --> 15:46.244
(voice shaking)
Only 12 more tests to go!

15:46.246 --> 15:49.080
-(bell dings)
-Yaaaay!

15:49.082 --> 15:52.317
Team Awesome is ba-aaack!

15:52.319 --> 15:56.321
Now, Rapunzel, I know my tests
have been a pain in the hm-hm.

15:56.323 --> 15:59.023
Aw, I wouldn't say pain.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.163
Y-- Now I would.

16:05.165 --> 16:07.966
In a moment, this little guy...

16:07.968 --> 16:10.234
he'll give us
all the answers we want.

16:10.236 --> 16:12.570
Woo-hoo! Answers!

16:12.572 --> 16:14.105
So, Eugene!

16:14.107 --> 16:15.340
(croak)

16:15.342 --> 16:18.143
Got yourself a secret, huh?

16:18.144 --> 16:20.945
If you wanna call it that.
The kid ha-- uh-uh,
nice try, Cass.

16:20.947 --> 16:23.448
(loud rumbling)

16:23.450 --> 16:25.149
Uuuuuh...

16:25.151 --> 16:28.119
Look, Raps, I think
it's time to go. Now.

16:28.121 --> 16:29.520
Now? You're kidding, right?

16:29.522 --> 16:30.955
This is almost finished.

16:30.957 --> 16:32.023
(bell dings)

16:33.326 --> 16:34.959
(mutters)
Can we talk?

16:34.961 --> 16:38.363
Uh-ha, of course! That's
what Team Awesome does! Whoa!

16:38.365 --> 16:41.199
Those things down there
are dangerous!

16:41.201 --> 16:42.867
Dangerous?
No, they're not dangerous,

16:42.869 --> 16:44.535
I-- I have adjusted
my calculations

16:44.537 --> 16:46.337
for every possible outcome.

16:46.339 --> 16:50.308
The margin of error
is-- is less than .56 percent

16:50.310 --> 16:51.809
or-- now, wait, was it .57?

16:51.811 --> 16:53.344
I don't know!

16:53.346 --> 16:55.313
Look, Varian. I think
you're a good kid,

16:55.315 --> 16:57.548
a-- a-- a smart kid,
and you got great intentions.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.283
But I'm asking you--
pleading with you--

16:59.285 --> 17:02.320
for the love of my life,
and your entire village,

17:02.322 --> 17:04.455
to please shut off
those machines

17:04.457 --> 17:07.959
until a seisma-quake-atologist
can come inspect 'em!

17:07.961 --> 17:10.728
Please! Do it
for Team Awesome!

17:10.730 --> 17:12.130
(loud rumbling)

17:12.132 --> 17:13.631
Ohhhh!

17:13.633 --> 17:16.701
I suppose I can
turn them down... a bit.

17:19.305 --> 17:20.838
(bell dings)

17:20.840 --> 17:24.075
All right!
Six more tests.
Then we can leave, right?

17:24.077 --> 17:27.011
Go someplace far away?
Really, really far away.

17:27.013 --> 17:28.413
Why do you want us
to leave so bad?

17:28.415 --> 17:30.715
Oh, no, you can stay.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.650
In fact, it'd be great
if you stayed.

17:32.652 --> 17:35.753
That way, when these things
blow u-- Oh, boy, never mind.

17:35.755 --> 17:38.122
Whoa-- Wait!
What did you just say?

17:39.826 --> 17:43.828
Okay, Varian.
I-- I guess it was .57. Heh.

17:43.830 --> 17:46.264
Eugene, what is wrong
with you?

17:46.266 --> 17:48.466
Okay! You wanna know why
we have to go?

17:52.205 --> 17:54.705
Oh, no... the Flynnoleum!

17:54.707 --> 17:56.240
(bell dings)

17:56.242 --> 17:58.209
Look, I tried to show you
I could keep a secret,
but I can't!

17:58.211 --> 18:00.311
-This kid--
-(rumbling)

18:02.248 --> 18:03.681
(bell dings)

18:05.051 --> 18:07.452
Varian's got
five of these huge,
highly-pressurized

18:07.454 --> 18:10.254
underground machines,
and they are clearly unstable.

18:10.256 --> 18:11.422
I think they could
blow up any minute!

18:14.360 --> 18:17.528
-And that minute is now.
-Get me out of this machine!

18:17.530 --> 18:19.030
Ehh, ahh!

18:19.032 --> 18:20.098
(bell dings)

18:22.302 --> 18:24.302
Um, guys? Hurry!

18:31.644 --> 18:32.777
Ahhhh!

18:34.314 --> 18:35.980
Give me your arm!

18:37.150 --> 18:38.349
Eugene!

18:39.486 --> 18:42.620
Varian! He's gonna
get himself killed!

18:42.622 --> 18:44.889
Get her outta here!
I'll get the kid.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.494
(bell dings)

18:49.496 --> 18:51.529
-Rapunzel: It's over!
-(cuckoo bird chimes)

18:52.832 --> 18:55.666
Aw! Uhh! I need those results!

18:55.668 --> 18:56.734
(bell dings)

19:02.475 --> 19:03.641
No!

19:09.782 --> 19:11.415
(grunts)

19:11.417 --> 19:12.416
(whinnying)

19:12.418 --> 19:14.152
Whoa!

19:17.524 --> 19:20.024
-Ohh!
-Listen, kid! We gotta
get outta here!

19:20.026 --> 19:23.361
No, no! Ugh!
No, I've got
three pumps to shut off,

19:23.363 --> 19:26.330
and I can't
let this happen again!

19:26.332 --> 19:27.398
Ahh!

19:31.604 --> 19:33.137
Look out!
(grunts)

19:33.139 --> 19:36.307
No, there's no time!
Get out of here!

19:36.309 --> 19:39.810
I am not going
anywhere without you.
I love you, Rapunzel.

19:39.812 --> 19:43.281
I love you, too.
More than you will ever know.

20:03.836 --> 20:06.370
What the hair?

20:06.372 --> 20:08.606
(clanging)

20:10.643 --> 20:13.344
Thank you, m'lady.

20:13.346 --> 20:14.412
Ugh...

20:14.414 --> 20:15.479
Varian!

20:16.416 --> 20:18.216
Man:
Varian!

20:19.752 --> 20:21.485
Quirin! Thank goodness
you're here!

20:21.487 --> 20:23.921
Uh-oh. It's my dad.

20:26.226 --> 20:29.527
Are you okay?
What happened?

20:29.529 --> 20:31.762
Dad, I'm sorry.

20:31.764 --> 20:34.699
Not again, Varian.

20:34.701 --> 20:38.536
-But, Dad--
-(sighs) Is everybody okay?

20:38.538 --> 20:39.704
Quirin, what do we do?

20:39.706 --> 20:41.572
It was terrible.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.509
(whinnying)

20:45.511 --> 20:48.379
I'm sorry you didn't
get those test results, Blondie.

20:48.381 --> 20:50.615
I should never have kept
a secret from you.

20:50.617 --> 20:53.517
From now on,
no more secrets. Ever.

20:53.519 --> 20:56.053
Oh, yeah?
Well, what about Cassandra?

20:56.055 --> 20:58.889
That's... between her and me.

20:58.891 --> 21:01.392
Okay. The truth?

21:01.394 --> 21:04.295
You know how
I said I just woke up
with my hair long?

21:04.297 --> 21:06.297
Well, I didn't.

21:06.299 --> 21:09.233
The night before,
Cass kinda helped me
break out of Corona.

21:09.235 --> 21:11.068
Ohhh, I knew it!

21:11.070 --> 21:13.771
Oh-ho-ho, she's gonna
get in so much trouble!

21:15.208 --> 21:19.577
-(horse growls)
-That is, of course,
if anyone were to find out,

21:19.579 --> 21:22.947
which they won't,
because this guy
is a vault.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.048
(slap)

21:27.253 --> 21:30.655
You should have seen it,
it was a crazy night.

21:30.657 --> 21:33.658
She showed me these black rocks,
and I know it sounds so weird,

21:33.660 --> 21:36.661
but I think they're
what made my hair grow back.

21:45.238 --> 21:47.638
Eugene:
Hey, after today,
nothing sounds weird.

21:47.640 --> 21:51.475
Rapunzel: And then
when I touched the rocks,
they started chasing us.

21:51.477 --> 21:53.477
Eugene:
Rocks chasing you?
Now we're back to weird.

21:53.479 --> 21:56.180
Rapunzel:
Yeah, well...
Max was there,

21:56.182 --> 22:00.151
and once we got
far enough away from them,
they stopped growing.

22:07.493 --> 22:10.494
("More of Me" playing)

22:10.496 --> 22:13.497
<i> ¶ Now I got my eyes</i>
<i> opening wider ¶</i>

22:13.499 --> 22:16.200
<i> ¶ My heart burning like fire ¶</i>

22:16.202 --> 22:20.438
<i> ¶ Feels like I'm so alive</i>
<i> I'm never going back ¶</i>

22:20.440 --> 22:23.307
<i> ¶ Whatever I want now</i>
<i> I'm gonna chase it ¶</i>

22:23.309 --> 22:25.543
<i> ¶ Who I am</i>
<i> I can't contain it ¶</i>

22:25.545 --> 22:28.713
<i> ¶ I'm not gonna hold it in ¶</i>

22:28.715 --> 22:31.282
<i> ¶ 'Cause there's</i>
<i> more of me to give ¶</i>

22:31.284 --> 22:33.784
<i> -¶ Oh, Oh ¶</i>
<i> -¶ Oh, yeah ¶</i>

22:33.786 --> 22:36.053
<i> ¶ There's more of me to give ¶</i>
