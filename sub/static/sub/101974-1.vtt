09:15.055 --> 09:17.371
I can fire these people, right?

09:17.391 --> 09:18.464
Edrisa.

09:18.559 --> 09:20.466
Right. Oh.

09:20.561 --> 09:22.561
How was she killed?
Well,

09:22.754 --> 09:24.563
not here, for starters.

09:24.756 --> 09:26.398
She was moved postmortem.

09:26.549 --> 09:27.715
As far as method,

09:27.776 --> 09:30.068
hold on to your hats.
(chuckles)

09:30.261 --> 09:31.736
Or heads.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.421
She was decapitated?

09:51.783 --> 09:53.483
That cut is...

09:53.585 --> 09:55.168
Incredibly precise.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.169
I know.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.429
What does it mean?

09:58.506 --> 10:01.266
Well, it means we can rule out
a crime of passion.

10:01.459 --> 10:04.010
This was... controlled,

10:04.104 --> 10:05.270
practiced.

10:05.463 --> 10:07.814
No detail overlooked.

10:08.758 --> 10:10.166
This was an execution.

10:10.226 --> 10:12.902
This is your version
of things looking up?

10:19.620 --> 10:20.952
WOMAN:
That's her. Millie.

10:21.145 --> 10:23.104
-Ms. Lee.
-JT: Thank you, Ms. Barba.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.181
Anything else we should know
about your client?

10:25.241 --> 10:27.441
I was only her attorney here
in New York.

10:27.461 --> 10:29.018
You'll need to speak
to her lawyers in Texas

10:29.079 --> 10:30.520
about her late husband's murder.

10:30.580 --> 10:32.355
The rumors.

10:32.457 --> 10:34.524
Rumors?

10:34.584 --> 10:35.800
Well, we love rumors.

10:35.952 --> 10:37.118
JT:
Official story is

10:37.220 --> 10:39.195
Millie's husband
was killed by a caterer,

10:39.255 --> 10:40.788
a young kid looking for money.

10:40.891 --> 10:41.865
BARBA:
There were...

10:41.883 --> 10:42.790
whispers.

10:42.851 --> 10:44.717
Millie had a relationship

10:44.811 --> 10:46.460
with a carpenter
working on her house.

10:46.521 --> 10:48.146
Boyd Hicks.

10:48.297 --> 10:52.225
He followed Millie here,
lived rent-free in her mansion.

10:52.377 --> 10:54.301
I warned her
it created the impression

10:54.363 --> 10:56.045
-that he...
-EDRISA: Killed her husband

10:56.064 --> 10:58.657
back in Texas.
Maybe Boyd killed Millie, too!

10:59.976 --> 11:01.660
I'm sorry, I got excited.

11:01.853 --> 11:03.903
I just...
I don't usually see this part.

11:04.055 --> 11:06.055
As I said, they're just rumors.

11:06.116 --> 11:08.408
Proving them is your job.

11:09.378 --> 11:10.985
JT:
Does "homicidal boyfriend"

11:11.046 --> 11:13.487
-fit with your profile?
-BRIGHT: Could be.

11:13.590 --> 11:16.582
But beheadings are almost always

11:16.718 --> 11:18.677
a form of punishment.

11:18.870 --> 11:21.421
This wasn't about the money.

11:21.556 --> 11:25.575
Our killer is a justice seeker.

11:25.635 --> 11:28.411
That's why Millie had to die.

11:28.430 --> 11:31.264
He also wasn't a novice.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.933
-Are we sure
it wasn't done postmortem?
-EDRISA: No.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.268
The decapitation killed her.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.603
It was a single strike,
high velocity.

11:37.698 --> 11:39.422
Like the world's
largest paper cutter.

11:39.524 --> 11:41.758
That's got a name.

11:41.818 --> 11:43.684
Guillotine.

11:43.745 --> 11:45.278
That makes sense.

11:45.430 --> 11:47.947
I pulled wood splinters
from the victim's neck.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.751
A strain of French oak that's
been extinct for over a century.

11:55.424 --> 11:57.364
Millie was killed

11:57.384 --> 12:01.219
by an actual,
historical guillotine?

12:01.370 --> 12:02.887
Yeah, exciting.

12:03.056 --> 12:06.616
So, how does someone acquire
one of those?

12:06.634 --> 12:08.117
Well, it's nearly impossible.

12:08.136 --> 12:09.394
The French government
destroyed most of them

12:09.545 --> 12:12.972
when they banned
capital punishment in '81.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.216
The last private auction
of a functional guillotine

12:15.277 --> 12:19.863
was here in New York
in, uh, '96, I think.

12:21.450 --> 12:22.966
Huh.

12:22.984 --> 12:24.225
What?

12:24.286 --> 12:26.135
You guys know
I collect murder weapons

12:26.154 --> 12:27.820
and related ephemera.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.581
That's not weird.

12:29.774 --> 12:31.583
It's so weird.

12:32.586 --> 12:35.069
Any idea who got this one?

12:35.130 --> 12:36.755
Uh, well,

12:36.923 --> 12:39.632
that was
before I started collecting.

12:41.970 --> 12:44.670
Though I do know someone

12:44.765 --> 12:46.672
who dabbled
in that world around then.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.082
JT:
Good.

12:48.143 --> 12:49.267
Run it down.

12:53.056 --> 12:55.023
It's The Surgeon, isn't it?

12:59.821 --> 13:01.654
(door opens)

13:08.646 --> 13:11.039
Malcolm.

13:13.409 --> 13:17.378
-It's so good to see...
-(Jerry blows raspberry)

13:20.658 --> 13:22.358
Who's this?

13:22.418 --> 13:23.635
Sorry. Where's my manners?

13:23.828 --> 13:25.303
Malcolm, Jerry.

13:25.496 --> 13:28.047
Jerry, Malcolm.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.957
Jerry here is my new roommate.

13:30.018 --> 13:32.459
(blowing raspberry)

13:32.521 --> 13:34.628
(laughs)

13:34.689 --> 13:36.389
Good stuff, Jer.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.465
Good stuff. I'm in hell.

13:38.527 --> 13:39.984
Hell.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.472
-Maybe we should reschedule.
-But why?

13:45.534 --> 13:47.474
Oh, no, we're back together.

13:47.536 --> 13:49.643
Finally able to really talk.

13:49.704 --> 13:51.621
Commiserate about...

13:53.708 --> 13:55.224
...you know what.

13:55.243 --> 13:57.560
Actually, I'm here on a case.

13:57.620 --> 13:59.078
(Martin laughs)

13:59.230 --> 14:01.822
Are you kidding?
I've waited months for this.

14:01.883 --> 14:04.325
Come on, partner.

14:04.386 --> 14:07.161
What's the hot goss?
I see they found his body.

14:07.222 --> 14:08.996
Stop talking.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.240
-(Jerry laughs)
-Jerome? Oh, please.

14:11.259 --> 14:14.427
It's cartoon time.
He's completely engrossed.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.262
Also, he's a moron.

14:16.414 --> 14:19.023
I think that Coyote
has a solid chance this time.

14:19.216 --> 14:20.507
I really do.

14:20.569 --> 14:23.052
My victim was decapitated.

14:23.146 --> 14:25.271
The killer
used an antique guillotine.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.773
I'm thinking
it was the one sold in '96.

14:27.926 --> 14:29.516
Well, uh, your theory is sound.

14:29.619 --> 14:32.095
It's the only working guillotine
in the tristate area.

14:32.155 --> 14:35.098
Good. Who won it? Where is it?

14:35.158 --> 14:37.767
Nope. Can't.

14:37.827 --> 14:39.285
Not feeling it.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.287
What-what are you...
what are you not feeling?

14:41.423 --> 14:42.797
Appreciated.

14:43.884 --> 14:46.109
We were partners.

14:46.169 --> 14:48.111
-There's a lot of blood.
<i> -MARTIN: All right,</i>

14:48.129 --> 14:49.721
<i> forget the blood.</i>
<i> Deal with the body first.</i>

14:49.872 --> 14:52.140
<i> Rigor mortis will make</i>
<i> dismemberment a real bitch.</i>

14:53.059 --> 14:54.392
I'm gonna chop him up?

14:54.585 --> 14:57.395
<i> This is for your sister, son.</i>

14:57.588 --> 14:59.455
I don't want to talk about it.

14:59.515 --> 15:01.399
I totally agree.
We should be singing about it,

15:01.592 --> 15:03.217
not whispering for Jerry.

15:03.278 --> 15:06.571
-Like father, like...
-Don't say that!

15:06.764 --> 15:08.907
Never say that.

15:09.058 --> 15:10.724
Oh, I'm sorry, Jer.
I'm sorry. Shh.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.059
Back to your toons. Yeah.

15:12.162 --> 15:14.913
"Meep, meep."
Yeah. That's it. Back.

15:16.641 --> 15:17.564
Note taken. I won't gush.

15:17.626 --> 15:20.418
But I got to ask. Estonia?

15:20.611 --> 15:21.735
How did you do that?

15:21.796 --> 15:23.588
No. It's my turn.

15:23.781 --> 15:25.590
-Who bought...
-The guillotine.

15:25.783 --> 15:27.258
Right, fine. Yes.

15:27.451 --> 15:28.760
Ugh.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.056
Give me a pen.

15:36.761 --> 15:40.104
He's a strange fellow,
this collector.

15:40.297 --> 15:41.681
BRIGHT:
You think he's a killer?

15:41.833 --> 15:43.849
Well, anybody can be a killer.

15:43.944 --> 15:45.443
Not anyone uses a guillotine.

15:45.594 --> 15:48.688
You're looking
for a student of the fatal arts.

15:48.823 --> 15:50.673
Start with him, my boy.

15:50.733 --> 15:52.408
(Jerry laughing)

15:53.787 --> 15:56.120
-My boy! My boy! My boy!
-Mr. David!

15:56.313 --> 15:57.938
-BRIGHT: I should go.
-No, no. Don't let Jerry

15:57.958 --> 15:59.791
spoil our good time.
Stay a little longer!

15:59.942 --> 16:02.627
-We're just getting
to the good stuff!
-(Jerry grunting)

16:04.321 --> 16:05.871
JERRY:
No!

16:05.966 --> 16:07.448
(Jerry screams)

16:07.467 --> 16:08.949
No! No!

16:09.052 --> 16:13.029
Oh, I really wish
you hadn't done that, Jer-bear.

16:13.956 --> 16:15.789
-(exhales)
-DANI: Don't go too easy on him.

16:15.850 --> 16:18.050
I need him back strong.

16:18.203 --> 16:20.703
-GIL: How do you
keep getting in here?
-I got moves.

16:20.763 --> 16:22.221
It's why you hired me.

16:22.373 --> 16:24.040
Don't let JT steal my job, now.

16:24.100 --> 16:26.467
-Ah, he wouldn't dare.
-Oh, I know.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.635
(exhales)
How's Bright?

16:28.697 --> 16:31.155
Out of ten, I'd say 11.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.049
He was

16:33.109 --> 16:34.717
on the edge last night.

16:34.736 --> 16:36.327
Little more Brightish
than usual.

16:36.520 --> 16:37.811
Don't worry.

16:37.872 --> 16:40.056
He needs to catch killers.
Keeps him sane.

16:40.158 --> 16:44.085
And I'll be back any day now.

16:47.215 --> 16:48.655
Don't rush it.

16:48.758 --> 16:49.841
You got stabbed.

16:50.034 --> 16:51.843
Multiple surgeries.

16:52.036 --> 16:54.721
I mean, you almost...

16:59.001 --> 17:00.926
GIL:
Hey, it's me.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.395
I'm good.

17:04.974 --> 17:06.673
<i> IZZY:</i>
<i> Apologies</i>

17:06.693 --> 17:07.917
for the mess.

17:07.935 --> 17:09.602
Just flew back this morning.

17:09.696 --> 17:12.755
Workers were supposed to be done
with the new dungeon, but...

17:12.857 --> 17:14.882
(inhales)
...guess not.

17:14.909 --> 17:17.184
The<i> new</i> dungeon?

17:17.287 --> 17:19.945
Yeah. For sex.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.021
Come on.

17:21.082 --> 17:23.916
Got my toys back this way.

17:26.212 --> 17:27.119
Ah.

17:27.272 --> 17:29.622
There's my gilly.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.198
BRIGHT:
Wow.

17:31.259 --> 17:33.200
She's a beaut.

17:33.261 --> 17:35.202
Must be... 1,400 pounds?

17:35.263 --> 17:37.221
1,600.

17:38.099 --> 17:40.633
Too heavy
for our killer to move.

17:40.785 --> 17:42.060
Maybe they didn't move it.

17:42.253 --> 17:44.062
Izzy, could you turn
the lights off for us?

17:44.213 --> 17:47.139
Give us a tick to... (chuckles
softly) find the switch.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.692
This should pick up
any blood spatter.

17:53.222 --> 17:55.239
Can I... can I ask you
a personal question?

17:55.432 --> 17:57.575
-Uh-huh.
-What's up with your mom
and Gil?

17:57.768 --> 17:59.318
Uh, nothing.

17:59.454 --> 18:01.412
Something. I don't know.

18:02.457 --> 18:04.990
For the cocky profiler,
you, uh, sure got blinders

18:05.143 --> 18:06.492
when it comes to your family.

18:06.644 --> 18:08.160
Well, with my family,
blinders are required.

18:08.296 --> 18:10.713
IZZY:
Found it!

18:12.616 --> 18:14.759
DANI:
That's a lot of blood.

18:15.786 --> 18:18.170
This is where Millie was killed.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.914
What the hell?

18:20.934 --> 18:22.491
-Is that blood?
-Izzy,

18:22.552 --> 18:23.935
where were you last night?

18:24.128 --> 18:25.661
On a jet.

18:25.721 --> 18:27.012
Look, I was Ambien'd up,

18:27.107 --> 18:29.682
but there's a dozen people
confirm it.

18:29.818 --> 18:31.859
(thumping in distance)

18:37.617 --> 18:39.358
(thumping continues)

18:39.452 --> 18:40.618
What's beneath us?

18:40.811 --> 18:42.954
Sex dungeon. Why?

18:47.910 --> 18:50.086

18:51.455 --> 18:53.022

19:00.831 --> 19:01.788
Someone's back there.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.457
Why is someone back there?

19:03.518 --> 19:04.809
I think...

19:05.002 --> 19:06.051
it's an immurement.

19:06.204 --> 19:08.037
Another classic execution.

19:08.097 --> 19:09.814
The victim is entombed alive

19:10.007 --> 19:12.299
and left to die a slow death.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.377
Bright, what are you...
