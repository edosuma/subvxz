00:10.447 --> 00:13.049
Sheldon, it's not a great time!

00:13.051 --> 00:14.517
What do you want?

00:14.519 --> 00:17.753
Hello to you, too.

00:17.755 --> 00:20.523
I'm sorry,
but this is important.

00:20.525 --> 00:22.158
What is it?

00:22.160 --> 00:23.726
<i>Back to the Future II</i> was

00:23.728 --> 00:26.629
in the <i>Back to the Future III</i>
case...

00:26.631 --> 00:29.098
and <i>Back to the Future III</i>
was-- get this--

00:29.100 --> 00:32.268
in the <i>Back to the Future II</i>
case.

00:32.711 --> 00:34.245
So?

00:34.247 --> 00:39.383
So, did you do that, or am I
in the house with an intruder?

00:40.352 --> 00:42.470
Sheldon, I got to go inside.

00:42.472 --> 00:45.306
It's getting rough out here.

00:46.475 --> 00:49.393
You're dodging the question;
I knew it was you.

00:52.982 --> 00:54.332
What was that?

00:54.334 --> 00:55.850
What was what?

00:55.852 --> 00:57.268
This isn't
a very good connection,

00:57.270 --> 01:00.404
but it sounded like someone
just released a kraken.

01:01.189 --> 01:05.409
Okay, I'm hanging up now.

01:05.411 --> 01:07.111
You know there's
no such thing as a...

01:09.866 --> 01:12.667
No...!

01:12.669 --> 01:15.453
Penny... Penny...

01:15.455 --> 01:17.204
Penny...!

01:17.206 --> 01:19.623
What's the matter?

01:19.625 --> 01:22.659
Um... well, I was worried

01:22.661 --> 01:25.162
that you might be
missing Leonard.

01:26.214 --> 01:28.933
And that might be causing
you to have bad dreams,

01:28.935 --> 01:32.186
like the kind you'd get if you
watched <i>Clash of the Titans</i>

01:32.188 --> 01:34.438
right before you went to bed.

01:35.190 --> 01:38.109
Sweetie, did <i>you</i> have
a bad dream?

01:38.977 --> 01:40.561
To be honest, I did.

01:40.563 --> 01:41.512
Aw.

01:41.514 --> 01:42.646
<i>Back to the Future II</i> was

01:42.648 --> 01:45.866
in the <i>Back to the</i>
<i>Future III</i> case.

01:45.868 --> 01:47.985
Leonard did it.

01:47.987 --> 01:48.953
Good night.

01:48.955 --> 01:50.438
No, wait.

01:50.440 --> 01:53.240
Perhaps I should sleep here

01:53.242 --> 01:56.060
so you don't miss
Leonard as much,

01:56.062 --> 01:59.296
uh, 'cause you're being
kind of a baby about it.

02:03.752 --> 02:06.253
You know what?
That would make me feel better.

02:06.255 --> 02:08.139
Thank you.
You're welcome.

02:12.110 --> 02:14.261
Good night.

02:45.150 --> 02:46.734
I think you'd be
pleased to hear

02:46.736 --> 02:48.452
that this morning in
the parking garage,

02:48.454 --> 02:50.270
I saw this oil
stain on the ground

02:50.272 --> 02:53.474
that was shaped just like
my ex-girlfriend, Lucy,

02:53.476 --> 02:55.559
and I didn't get upset at all.

02:55.561 --> 02:57.211
I'm proud of you.

02:57.213 --> 03:00.998
Well, you should be,
'cause she was looking good.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.335
Dear Lord!
You're an astronomer.

03:04.337 --> 03:06.220
Although you may
have earthly woes,

03:06.222 --> 03:08.539
get your mind back
on the stars.

03:08.541 --> 03:09.790
Gee, even the lowly
dung beetle

03:09.792 --> 03:13.160
chooses to plot its course
by using the Milky Way.

03:13.162 --> 03:14.328
Is that true?

03:14.330 --> 03:17.131
Everything I say is true.

03:17.133 --> 03:18.099
Now, of course,

03:18.101 --> 03:19.467
the dung beetle also enjoys

03:19.469 --> 03:21.485
eating feces, living in feces

03:21.487 --> 03:23.804
and making little
balls out of feces.

03:23.806 --> 03:27.525
So pick and choose which
aspects of its lifestyle

03:27.527 --> 03:29.493
you want to embrace.

03:30.311 --> 03:31.996
Come on,
you can talk to girls now.

03:31.998 --> 03:34.148
It shouldn't be hard for you
to meet someone new.

03:34.150 --> 03:35.332
How can I meet someone new

03:35.334 --> 03:38.052
when everywhere I look,
I see Lucy's face?

03:38.054 --> 03:39.787
Tell me you don't see her smile

03:39.789 --> 03:43.157
in the crust
of this chicken pot pie.

03:43.159 --> 03:45.009
Oh, will you stop it!

03:49.330 --> 03:50.581
Now, listen to me.

03:50.583 --> 03:51.715
There's a welcome party

03:51.717 --> 03:52.917
for incoming post-docs tonight.

03:52.919 --> 03:54.518
Go to it and meet someone

03:54.520 --> 03:57.771
who isn't made of grease or pie.

03:57.773 --> 04:01.108
You think you're so cool
because your wife is a person?

04:03.512 --> 04:05.279
Look,

04:05.281 --> 04:07.181
Bernie's at a neuroscience
conference with Amy--

04:07.183 --> 04:08.566
I'll go with you.

04:08.568 --> 04:09.717
You would do that for me?
Of course.

04:09.719 --> 04:10.951
You're my friend.

04:10.953 --> 04:12.319
I want you to be happy.

04:12.321 --> 04:14.205
Thanks. Oh, Sheldon,

04:14.207 --> 04:15.739
since Amy's out of town,
would you like to join us?

04:15.741 --> 04:18.442
I want you to be happy, too,

04:18.444 --> 04:21.745
but not enough
to do anything about it.

04:24.449 --> 04:26.200
Howie, stop.

04:26.202 --> 04:27.301
I can't talk like that.

04:27.303 --> 04:30.004
Amy's right here.

04:30.006 --> 04:32.173
Sheldon, stop.
For the last time,

04:32.175 --> 04:35.392
I will not bring home bed bugs.

04:35.394 --> 04:36.543
The hotel's nice.

04:36.545 --> 04:38.262
There's a pool, a gym--

04:38.264 --> 04:39.880
the bar looks like fun.

04:39.882 --> 04:43.767
Because I looked in the bed,
and there are no bugs.

04:43.769 --> 04:45.069
Aw, I love you, too.

04:45.071 --> 04:47.387
If I don't talk to you
before you go to sleep,

04:47.389 --> 04:49.356
I'll meet you in dreamland.

04:49.358 --> 04:50.608
Good night.

04:50.610 --> 04:53.911
No, I will not consider sleeping
in my garment bag.

04:57.265 --> 05:01.035
Penny, did you ever wonder
how Starfleet captains...

05:01.037 --> 05:03.220
No.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.258
Well, now that I've piqued
your interest,

05:07.260 --> 05:10.211
welcome to the exciting world
of 3D chess.

05:10.213 --> 05:12.129
Why don't you just admit

05:12.131 --> 05:13.347
you only want to play this game

05:13.349 --> 05:14.765
because you always
play it with Leonard

05:14.767 --> 05:15.883
and you miss him?

05:15.885 --> 05:19.436
You overestimate
his significance in my life.

05:19.438 --> 05:20.688
Oh...

05:20.690 --> 05:22.806
Do I miss
how he makes a face

05:22.808 --> 05:25.092
on my toaster waffle
with syrup?

05:25.094 --> 05:26.677
No.

05:26.679 --> 05:28.979
Do I miss the way

05:28.981 --> 05:31.899
he fixes the zipper on my jacket
when it gets stuck?

05:31.901 --> 05:33.984
I don't think so.

05:33.986 --> 05:36.036
Do I miss how
we say "good night"

05:36.038 --> 05:38.489
to each other through the walls
of our bedroom

05:38.491 --> 05:39.857
using Morse code?

05:44.713 --> 05:46.130
Okay, I get it, I get it.

05:46.132 --> 05:47.998
You are an emotionless robot.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.401
Well, I try.

05:50.403 --> 05:53.037
All right, let's just get
this stupid game over with.

05:53.039 --> 05:54.271
Great. I'll go first.
Okay.

05:54.273 --> 05:56.423
By the way,
how are you with zippers?

05:56.424 --> 05:57.112
Why?

05:57.137 --> 05:58.727
Well, I really need
to go to the bathroom,

05:58.728 --> 06:01.478
and this one's gone
all cattywampus.

06:04.099 --> 06:07.151
Wow, your work on
jellyfish neural nets

06:07.153 --> 06:08.502
sounds so interesting.

06:08.504 --> 06:09.687
It is.

06:09.689 --> 06:12.489
You can download my paper
off the university server.

06:12.491 --> 06:14.658
I will. You can
download my paper

06:14.660 --> 06:17.528
on the Van Allen Belts from the
university server as well.

06:17.530 --> 06:19.280
I will.

06:20.282 --> 06:22.449
All right.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:36.615 --> 06:38.182
How'd it go?

06:38.184 --> 06:40.334
Well, if you like dry,
factual statements

06:40.336 --> 06:42.436
interspersed with painful
moments of silence,

06:42.438 --> 06:44.355
it was bananas.

06:45.173 --> 06:46.624
Check it out.

06:46.626 --> 06:48.692
Mrs. Davis from Human
Resources is here.

06:48.694 --> 06:51.345
She's probably on the lookout
for sexual harassment.

06:51.347 --> 06:52.596
Oh, great.

06:52.598 --> 06:55.515
There go my chances
of being sexually harassed.

06:55.517 --> 07:00.287
I heard her husband left her
for a hot, young undergrad.

07:00.289 --> 07:03.073
That's so much better
than the old, ugly ones.

07:07.812 --> 07:09.246
Mr. Wolowitz,

07:09.248 --> 07:10.297
Dr. Koothrappali.

07:10.299 --> 07:11.715
Mrs. Davis,
nice to see you.

07:11.717 --> 07:15.369
You know, I recently read
a fascinating article

07:15.371 --> 07:18.072
on infidelity among penguins.

07:18.074 --> 07:20.674
Okay.

07:20.676 --> 07:23.310
So if the fact
that your husband left you

07:23.312 --> 07:25.212
makes you feel unattractive,
just remember,

07:25.214 --> 07:28.248
penguins get cheated on,
and they're adorable.

07:41.112 --> 07:43.831
It was better when you
couldn't talk to women.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.168
I was thinking of going
to the lecture

07:48.170 --> 07:50.070
on posterior cingulate
cortex lesions

07:50.072 --> 07:52.339
in the formation
of autobiographical memory.

07:52.341 --> 07:54.291
Oh, brain lesions
are fascinating.

07:54.293 --> 07:57.378
Unless they're yours,
then they're a drag.

07:57.380 --> 07:59.913
To the advancement of science.

07:59.915 --> 08:03.016
And to the sick and dying
who make it possible.

08:05.136 --> 08:07.271
This is fun; we never
really get to talk shop

08:07.273 --> 08:08.305
with Penny around.

08:08.307 --> 08:10.057
We usually just end up
talking about boys.

08:10.059 --> 08:12.359
Which is fine,
but it's nice to mix it up

08:12.361 --> 08:14.261
with a little intellectual
conversation.

08:14.263 --> 08:16.880
From the two gentlemen
at the bar.

08:16.882 --> 08:18.482
Oh, my gosh, boys
bought us drinks!

08:18.484 --> 08:21.151
Boys bought us drinks!

08:21.153 --> 08:23.020
Thank you, thank you,
thank you so much.

08:24.406 --> 08:26.123
Be cool.
You be cool!

08:26.125 --> 08:29.209
Guys are hitting on us, and
not just to get to Penny.

08:30.195 --> 08:31.962
You're right.

08:31.964 --> 08:33.414
Thank you.

08:38.001 --> 08:40.203
Ooh! Bad move.

08:40.206 --> 08:42.371
Really? Why?

08:42.374 --> 08:45.592
My queen can now take your rook
from below.

08:45.594 --> 08:47.678
So that means I lose, right?

08:47.680 --> 08:49.313
It's over!

08:49.315 --> 08:52.716
If I make this move...

08:52.718 --> 08:56.236
but I won't because we're having
too much fun.

08:57.038 --> 08:59.907
Okay, let's take a break.

08:59.909 --> 09:02.826
We're all out of alcohol.

09:02.828 --> 09:04.461
I wasn't going to get alcohol.

09:10.953 --> 09:12.703
Gosh, I wonder what
Leonard's doing right now.

09:12.705 --> 09:15.005
I miss him so much.

09:15.007 --> 09:16.656
Well, if you'd like,

09:16.658 --> 09:18.041
we could call him.

09:18.043 --> 09:20.244
I-I mean that
you could call him.

09:20.246 --> 09:21.545
As I've explained,

09:21.547 --> 09:23.680
the absence of my friends
does not cause me pain.

09:23.682 --> 09:25.933
As rock and roll bad boy,
Paul Simon, once said,

09:25.935 --> 09:27.017
"I am a rock.

09:27.019 --> 09:29.269
I am an i-i-i-island."

09:30.438 --> 09:32.239
I'm calling him.

09:32.241 --> 09:34.107
Oh, goodie!
Put him on speakerphone!

09:42.535 --> 09:43.867
Excuse me, ladies,

09:43.869 --> 09:45.486
but my pants are buzzing.

09:47.872 --> 09:50.357
North Sea, how can I "kelp" you?

09:52.443 --> 09:53.410
Leonard?

09:53.412 --> 09:54.545
Penny?

09:54.547 --> 09:55.662
Hey, it's Penny.

09:55.664 --> 09:56.863
Everybody say hi to Penny.

09:56.865 --> 09:58.549
Hi, Penny!

09:58.551 --> 10:02.269
Wow, it sounds like
you're having a good time.

10:02.271 --> 10:05.155
Best time of my life!

10:06.758 --> 10:09.910
Isn't it 5:30
in the morning there?

10:09.912 --> 10:11.044
Is it?

10:11.046 --> 10:13.764
Hey, everybody,
it's 5:30 in the morning!

10:15.801 --> 10:17.317
Uh...

10:17.319 --> 10:19.203
okay, well,
we were just calling you

10:19.205 --> 10:20.720
because we were missing you.

10:20.722 --> 10:21.939
Iceberg!

10:21.941 --> 10:23.023
Uh-oh, hang on.

10:23.025 --> 10:24.658
Are you in danger?

10:24.660 --> 10:26.193
No, it's a drinking game.

10:26.195 --> 10:28.228
Whenever we see an iceberg,
we take a shot!

10:28.230 --> 10:30.280
Berg! Berg!

10:30.282 --> 10:32.699
Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg--

10:33.418 --> 10:34.701
Leonard, Leonard?

10:37.839 --> 10:40.541
I cannot believe we were
missing that jerk.

10:40.543 --> 10:43.360
<i>You</i> were.

10:52.050 --> 10:53.934
So what happened?
How'd it go?

10:53.936 --> 10:56.336
It's fine. I thanked them again
and let them know

10:56.338 --> 10:57.270
we're not available.

10:57.272 --> 10:59.422
So I can drink this
without having

10:59.424 --> 11:01.358
to give up the goodies?

11:01.360 --> 11:02.475
Yes, it's all cool.

11:02.477 --> 11:05.378
Although, if you wanted
to talk to one of them,

11:05.380 --> 11:06.696
no one would blame you.

11:06.698 --> 11:09.482
And why would no one
blame me?

11:10.318 --> 11:13.770
I don't know
what I'm saying.

11:13.772 --> 11:16.289
Well, it sounds
like you're saying

11:16.291 --> 11:18.041
that I could do better
than Sheldon.

11:18.043 --> 11:20.410
Boy, these drinks are strong!

11:21.829 --> 11:26.066
Hoo, mama, I'm gonna be gginhu !

11:27.385 --> 11:29.252
No, tell me,
I want to know

11:29.254 --> 11:30.837
what you meant by that.

11:33.007 --> 11:35.342
I just meant
that you're not married

11:35.344 --> 11:37.260
and your boyfriend's kind of...

11:37.262 --> 11:39.229
Sheldon.

11:39.231 --> 11:42.265
And your husband
is extremely Howard.

11:42.267 --> 11:44.734
What's your point?

11:45.820 --> 11:47.654
Sorry.
I have no point.

11:47.656 --> 11:49.138
That was a stupid thing
to say.

11:49.140 --> 11:51.524
Can we please just go back
to having a nice time?

11:51.526 --> 11:54.828
We could, but unfortunately
my brain is lesion-free

11:54.830 --> 11:56.696
and I remember that
rotten thing

11:56.698 --> 11:58.949
you just said about
my sweet baboo.

11:58.951 --> 12:00.116
Come on. I apologize.

12:00.118 --> 12:02.085
Can we please
just let it go?

12:03.037 --> 12:05.288
Sure.
Thanks.

12:07.091 --> 12:09.993
Your husband's weird
and his clothes are ridiculous.

12:12.430 --> 12:13.480
I can't believe it!

12:13.482 --> 12:14.914
All this time
I've been doing nothing

12:14.916 --> 12:16.483
but sit around
and miss that guy.

12:16.485 --> 12:18.134
And you know what
the worst part is?

12:18.136 --> 12:19.669
That you're having to process

12:19.671 --> 12:21.771
your emotional pain
without vodka?

12:26.694 --> 12:28.695
No.

12:28.697 --> 12:30.780
Yes.

12:32.683 --> 12:34.684
But you know what
the second-worst part is?

12:34.686 --> 12:36.236
He does not miss me at all.

12:36.238 --> 12:39.139
Allow me to comfort you.

12:39.141 --> 12:42.309
At least you've got your health.

12:44.312 --> 12:46.930
Really? Tha-That's it?
That's comforting?

12:46.932 --> 12:51.001
Um, uh, in a hundred years,

12:51.003 --> 12:53.987
you'll both be dead
and it won't matter?

12:53.989 --> 12:56.139
No! Come on!

12:56.141 --> 12:58.925
You're supposed to say,
"Of course he misses you.

12:58.927 --> 13:01.878
The only reason he's partying is
to cover up his pain."

13:01.880 --> 13:04.531
Oh, no, I don't think
that's true at all.

13:07.051 --> 13:08.435
This is ridiculous.

13:08.437 --> 13:10.937
Why am I upset just because
he's off having a good time?

13:10.939 --> 13:15.158
Well... perhaps you're
obsessively picturing him

13:15.160 --> 13:19.496
engaged in drunken coitus
with another woman.

13:21.882 --> 13:25.518
Is that it?
Did I get it right?

13:27.038 --> 13:28.121
Okay, tha-that's great.

13:28.123 --> 13:30.407
You can stop trying to make me
feel better now.

13:30.409 --> 13:33.176
Actually, I can't.
Before Leonard left,

13:33.178 --> 13:35.662
he made me promise
that I'd take care of you.

13:35.664 --> 13:38.048
He did?
Yes.

13:38.050 --> 13:40.834
Oh, that's really sweet.

13:40.836 --> 13:42.519
Plus, if I do a good job,

13:42.521 --> 13:45.372
he said he'd bring me back
a sailor's cap.

13:47.274 --> 13:49.192
Now I miss him even more.

13:49.194 --> 13:53.780
Well, if it's any consolation,
I'm sure Leonard's tormented

13:53.782 --> 13:59.235
every moment he's away from your
warm embrace and cherry lips.

14:00.704 --> 14:01.671
Thanks.

14:01.673 --> 14:03.540
Oh, seriously?

14:06.143 --> 14:08.578
Uh, excuse me, Mrs. Davis?

14:08.580 --> 14:09.879
What?

14:09.881 --> 14:12.916
I'd like to apologize
for being insensitive.

14:12.918 --> 14:16.636
And for possibly making penguins
seem like jerks,

14:16.638 --> 14:20.140
'cause 99% of them
are stand-up guys.

14:20.142 --> 14:22.175
Forget about it.

14:23.561 --> 14:26.696
You know, you-you and I,
you and I have a lot in common.

14:26.698 --> 14:28.114
Is that right?

14:28.116 --> 14:29.816
Oh, yes, I-I, too,

14:29.818 --> 14:32.435
am in the throes of heartbreak.

14:32.437 --> 14:34.237
Okay, fine,
I'll tell you about it.

14:36.857 --> 14:41.327
Here is a hot beverage
to comfort you.

14:41.329 --> 14:43.229
It's in a to-go cup.

14:43.231 --> 14:45.081
Make of that
what you will.

14:46.817 --> 14:49.702
Come on. It's still early.

14:49.704 --> 14:51.087
Let's do something.

14:51.089 --> 14:56.676
Well, I have been toying around
with an idea for 4-D chess.

14:56.678 --> 14:58.394
How about we just talk?

14:58.396 --> 14:59.446
All right.

14:59.448 --> 15:01.714
In 4-D chess...
No.

15:02.883 --> 15:05.418
Come on, let's talk
about our lives.

15:05.420 --> 15:07.303
Tell me something
about you I don't know.

15:07.305 --> 15:08.721
Hmm.

15:10.774 --> 15:14.177
I own nine pairs of pants.

15:16.013 --> 15:18.014
Okay, that-that's a good start,

15:18.016 --> 15:19.365
but I was thinking
maybe something

15:19.367 --> 15:20.416
a little more personal.

15:20.418 --> 15:22.785
I see.
Hmm.

15:22.787 --> 15:27.190
I own nine pairs
of underpants.

15:29.493 --> 15:31.261
How about I go first?

15:31.263 --> 15:34.414
But I don't want to know
how many underpants you own.

15:34.416 --> 15:36.499
Although, based on the floor
of your bedroom,

15:36.501 --> 15:38.251
I'd say it's a thousand.

15:38.253 --> 15:42.755
Okay, look, here's something
people do not know about me.

15:42.757 --> 15:44.591
When I first moved out
to L.A.,

15:44.593 --> 15:47.043
I did a topless scene
in a low-budget horror movie

15:47.045 --> 15:48.645
about a killer gorilla.

15:48.647 --> 15:51.214
Ugh! After I did it,
I felt so ashamed.

15:51.216 --> 15:54.384
Thankfully, that thing
never came out.

15:54.386 --> 15:56.552
I've seen that.

15:57.505 --> 15:59.606
Yeah. <i>Serial Apeist.</i>

16:02.243 --> 16:05.161
Howard found it online
the day we met you.

16:05.163 --> 16:06.663
Oh, God...

16:06.665 --> 16:07.730
And it was literally

16:07.732 --> 16:09.465
the moment you walked
out the door.

16:11.403 --> 16:16.005
But I see the type of personal
revelations you're going for.

16:16.007 --> 16:19.709
Okay, here's one I thought
I'd take to the grave.

16:19.711 --> 16:20.994
Okay.

16:20.996 --> 16:23.296
Hmm.

16:23.298 --> 16:24.681
A while back,

16:24.683 --> 16:27.884
YouTube changed
its user interface

16:27.886 --> 16:32.572
from a star-based rating system
to a thumbs-up rating system.

16:32.574 --> 16:37.594
I tell people I'm okay with it,
but I'm really not.

16:42.466 --> 16:44.117
That's your big revelation?

16:44.119 --> 16:46.853
Yes.

16:46.855 --> 16:49.439
Whew! I feel ten pounds lighter.

16:49.441 --> 16:51.157
Okay, you know what?

16:51.159 --> 16:52.175
I give up.

16:52.177 --> 16:54.193
I'm going to bed.

16:55.279 --> 16:57.413
Here's something else
you don't know about me:

16:57.415 --> 16:59.566
you just hurt my feelings.

16:59.568 --> 17:00.767
What did I do?

17:00.769 --> 17:02.335
I opened up and shared something

17:02.337 --> 17:04.053
deeply upsetting to me,

17:04.055 --> 17:06.222
and you treated it
as if it were nothing.

17:06.223 --> 17:09.092
I-I didn't think
it was a big deal.

17:09.094 --> 17:11.928
It is to me; that's the point.

17:14.781 --> 17:16.465
Sheldon, you are right.

17:16.468 --> 17:17.550
I'm really sorry.

17:17.551 --> 17:19.218
I should've known better.

17:19.220 --> 17:21.054
Your apology is accepted.

17:21.056 --> 17:23.138
Thank you.

17:23.141 --> 17:24.440
How about a hug?

17:24.442 --> 17:25.925
How about a hearty handshake?

17:25.926 --> 17:27.827
Come on.

17:30.814 --> 17:32.799
Now I know how you felt
getting mauled

17:32.801 --> 17:36.035
by that sex-crazed
gorilla.

17:51.518 --> 17:52.552
Good night.

17:52.554 --> 17:54.337
Mm-hmm.

18:00.527 --> 18:03.796
It was rather flattering to have
strangers send us drinks.

18:03.798 --> 18:06.299
Yeah, that felt nice.

18:07.835 --> 18:10.903
Maybe tomorrow morning
we put on some hot pants

18:10.905 --> 18:14.107
and see if we can score us
some free omelets.

18:15.576 --> 18:20.163
So, hypothetically, if-if we
were to have gone with them,

18:20.165 --> 18:22.115
which one would you have picked?

18:24.385 --> 18:25.735
I think I would

18:25.737 --> 18:28.471
have gone with the short one
with the goofy haircut.

18:28.473 --> 18:30.539
Oh, good, 'cause I liked
the tall thin one.

18:30.541 --> 18:32.725
He seemed intelligent,
kind of a loner,

18:32.727 --> 18:35.211
maybe a little sexually
inexperienced,

18:35.213 --> 18:38.097
like I'd have to teach
him a thing or two.

18:39.968 --> 18:41.818
Not my guy.

18:41.820 --> 18:43.770
I caught him staring
at my rack.

18:44.672 --> 18:46.722
It'd be nice to be with a man

18:46.724 --> 18:49.492
who wants to know
what's underneath my cardigan.

18:49.494 --> 18:52.495
FYI, it's another cardigan.

18:54.631 --> 18:57.967
Your short sexed-up guy
kind of sounds like Howard.

18:57.969 --> 19:01.237
Your brainy virgin kind
of sounds like Sheldon.

19:02.005 --> 19:03.840
Good night.
Night.

19:06.543 --> 19:09.512
All right, Dr. Koothrappali,
it's been nice talking to you,

19:09.514 --> 19:10.880
but I need to go home

19:10.882 --> 19:12.014
and relieve my babysitter.

19:12.016 --> 19:14.267
Yeah, I can relate
to being a single parent.

19:14.269 --> 19:16.219
I have a dog.

19:16.221 --> 19:19.055
Yeah, it's exactly
the same thing.

19:19.057 --> 19:20.356
Good night.

19:20.358 --> 19:22.024
Mrs. Davis...

19:22.026 --> 19:24.861
I, uh, I must confess,

19:24.863 --> 19:26.279
I came here tonight

19:26.281 --> 19:29.015
in a futile attempt
to pick up some lonely postdoc,

19:29.017 --> 19:33.252
but instead I got to connect
with you at a human level.

19:33.254 --> 19:36.022
That's a much better evening.

19:36.757 --> 19:38.825
You're a lovely person.

19:38.827 --> 19:40.576
Are you hitting on me?

19:40.578 --> 19:42.328
No, no, no, that would be crazy!

19:42.330 --> 19:43.800
I mean, if I were hitting
on you, you'd know it

19:43.801 --> 19:46.602
'cause you'd feel uncomfortable
and a little sad for me.

19:50.871 --> 19:52.755
You're sweet.

19:53.791 --> 19:55.708
Good night, Dr. Koothrappali.

19:55.710 --> 19:57.810
Good night.

19:59.313 --> 20:01.531
Looks like she accepted
your apology.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.232
And then some.

20:03.234 --> 20:05.318
I think we had a moment.

20:05.320 --> 20:07.987
Oh, please, you did not
have a moment.

20:07.989 --> 20:10.189
Who died and
made you king of moments?

20:12.526 --> 20:15.111
Okay, fine. Let's say
there was a moment.

20:15.113 --> 20:16.979
There was.
There wasn't.

20:16.981 --> 20:21.083
But... But even if there was,
what are you gonna do about it?

20:21.085 --> 20:27.006
I will slowly seduce her until
she falls helpless into my bed,

20:27.008 --> 20:29.008
hungry for the pleasure
only I can give her.

20:29.010 --> 20:30.877
So nothing.
No, not a thing.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.356
Ah...

20:41.358 --> 20:43.859
I'm so glad the police
finally caught

20:43.861 --> 20:47.496
that psychotic
genetically engineered ape.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.970
That is my girlfriend!
I swear to God!

20:56.507 --> 21:00.041
Leonard! Leonard!
Leonard! Leonard!
