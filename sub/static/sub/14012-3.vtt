WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:05.337
<i> by two separate</i>
<i> yet equally important groups:</i>

00:05.339 --> 00:07.339
<i> The police,</i>
<i> who investigate crime</i>

00:07.341 --> 00:09.775
<i> and the district attorneys,</i>
<i> who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:09.777 --> 00:11.443
<i> These are their stories.</i>

00:16.384 --> 00:19.351
So, I testify
on a couple of RDO's.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.387
What's the difference
to him?

00:21.389 --> 00:23.389
It's not
out of their pocket.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.290
Everybody gets one, Jack.

00:25.292 --> 00:26.291
You'll get yours.

00:26.293 --> 00:27.626
Hey, I need them.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.395
She's dropping cash
like it's on fire.

00:29.397 --> 00:30.529
Every card's jacked full.

00:30.531 --> 00:31.563
Ah-ha!

00:31.565 --> 00:34.433
A horse is a horse,
of course.

00:34.435 --> 00:36.502
My kingdom for a horse!

00:38.439 --> 00:39.805
Look at this.

00:39.807 --> 00:42.508
The next De Niro.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.244
Hey!

00:45.246 --> 00:47.513
You guys want
to get that stuff

00:47.515 --> 00:49.581
back to costume,
please?

01:09.336 --> 01:10.602
Hey, Graham.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.539
I think this is it.

01:13.541 --> 01:16.542
Sorry. I didn't know
you were waiting for them.

01:16.544 --> 01:18.277
Priscilla?

01:18.279 --> 01:19.411
You decent?

01:21.449 --> 01:23.315
No need praying, prissy.

01:23.317 --> 01:25.384
Reviews can't hurt us now.

01:25.386 --> 01:27.319
(<i> phone disconnect beeping</i>
<i> rapidly over receiver</i> )

01:27.321 --> 01:29.488
What if David Merrick's
trying to call?

01:29.490 --> 01:30.522
(<i> hangs up phone,</i>
<i> beeping stops</i> )

01:33.327 --> 01:34.526
Oh, God!

01:34.528 --> 01:36.495
(<i> gasping</i> )

01:36.497 --> 01:38.697
OFFICER:
Where are
the damn paramedics?

01:38.699 --> 01:39.698
I radioed.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.233
They're coming.

01:42.336 --> 01:43.602
Hold on, honey.

01:45.272 --> 01:48.307
I didn't want to do it.

01:48.309 --> 01:51.310
I didn't...

01:51.312 --> 01:54.313
want to do...

01:54.315 --> 01:55.447
All right.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.715
Let 'em through.

02:02.423 --> 02:04.323
report to the solarium.
Dr. Kipper,

02:04.325 --> 02:06.425
please.
Dr. Kipper to the solarium,

02:06.427 --> 02:08.227
This your run?

02:08.229 --> 02:09.528
We got there first.

02:09.530 --> 02:12.297
19. Her name was
Priscilla Blaine.

02:12.299 --> 02:13.499
Cause of death?

02:13.501 --> 02:15.501
Narcon's response
was positive.

02:15.503 --> 02:16.602
She O.D.'d.

02:16.604 --> 02:18.203
Who found her?

02:18.205 --> 02:19.404
Classmates

02:19.406 --> 02:21.640
at the Academy
of Dramatic Arts.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.642
No business
like show business.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.645
If she O.D.'d, what
do you need us for?

02:26.647 --> 02:29.314
Before she died,
over and over:

02:29.316 --> 02:31.316
"I didn't want to do it.

02:31.318 --> 02:33.218
I didn't want to do it."

02:33.220 --> 02:35.387
She didn't
want to do what?

02:35.389 --> 02:38.290
Hey, you're wearing
the suits.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.494
Ohh.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.363
Oh, my God.

04:13.654 --> 04:16.388
Amitriptyline.

04:16.390 --> 04:17.823
Never heard of it.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.625
Antidepressant.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.627
How much she take of it?

04:21.629 --> 04:22.828
About 200 milligrams.

04:22.830 --> 04:25.397
Could probably do
a small elephant.

04:25.399 --> 04:28.367
Was there any physical trauma,
any bruises,

04:28.369 --> 04:29.835
anything suspicious?

04:29.837 --> 04:33.405
She did have an Ace bandage
on her right ankle.

04:33.407 --> 04:34.840
Nothing wrong with it.

04:34.842 --> 04:37.409
No visible bruising
about the ligament.

04:37.411 --> 04:38.644
An old injury?

04:38.646 --> 04:40.612
No blood in the joint space.

04:40.614 --> 04:41.913
Fashion statement?

04:43.417 --> 04:45.384
Priscilla wasn't on drugs.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.853
I would have known
if she was on drugs.

04:47.855 --> 04:50.422
Mrs. Blaine,
would you happen to know

04:50.424 --> 04:53.692
if Priscilla was seeing
a psychiatrist?

04:53.694 --> 04:55.761
See, the reason
I'm asking is

04:55.763 --> 04:59.698
the drug in her system
was an antidepressant.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.767
She wasn't depressed.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.804
You mind
if we take this?

05:11.345 --> 05:16.748
We were going to have
new head shots taken next week.

05:25.659 --> 05:29.394
Patti, did your sister
happen to mention to you

05:29.396 --> 05:31.463
anything about seeing
new people lately?

05:31.465 --> 05:32.731
Um...

05:32.733 --> 05:34.900
i wouldn't really know.

05:40.374 --> 05:45.444
I remember the first day
she got into the academy.

05:45.446 --> 05:48.814
They took 50 out of 1,500.

05:48.816 --> 05:51.450
Ever since she could talk,

05:51.452 --> 05:54.486
she wanted to be
a performer.

06:04.832 --> 06:06.465
She didn't do drugs.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.367
She was too focused.

06:08.369 --> 06:10.502
They just would have
slowed her down.

06:10.504 --> 06:13.505
You think she was happy?

06:13.507 --> 06:15.540
Yeah, she was.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.476
I guess.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.545
WOMAN:
Anything for anyone.

06:20.547 --> 06:21.780
It's just...

06:21.782 --> 06:22.914
it's not her.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.450
What do you mean--
the drugs?

06:25.452 --> 06:26.551
Mm-hmm.

06:26.553 --> 06:29.388
She didn't believe in them.

06:29.390 --> 06:31.823
I thought
she'd be hit by lightning

06:31.825 --> 06:33.825
before she'd die like that.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.761
The officer who was here
last night said,

06:35.763 --> 06:37.429
she kept repeating,
"I didn't want to do it."

06:37.431 --> 06:39.564
You know what that was about?

06:39.566 --> 06:40.932
No.

06:40.934 --> 06:43.502
Is it possible
somebody pressured her

06:43.504 --> 06:45.837
into taking the pills?

06:45.839 --> 06:48.540
No one's really into that
around here.

06:48.542 --> 06:51.443
Yeah, there was
a lot of drinking

06:51.445 --> 06:54.479
because it was closing night.

06:54.481 --> 06:55.914
I don't know.

06:57.418 --> 06:59.551
Did she have a boyfriend?

07:01.522 --> 07:03.455
We broke up
a few months ago.

07:03.457 --> 07:05.457
It was getting weird.

07:05.459 --> 07:06.825
Yeah?

07:06.827 --> 07:08.927
Was she depressed
by the break?

07:08.929 --> 07:10.429
Not quite.

07:10.431 --> 07:12.431
She dumped me.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.800
When you and Priscilla
were together,

07:14.802 --> 07:17.436
did she like
to party a lot

07:17.438 --> 07:18.804
you know?

07:18.806 --> 07:20.839
No, Priscilla
didn't do drugs.

07:20.841 --> 07:23.809
The only pills she took
were birth control.

07:23.811 --> 07:25.811
God only knows why.

07:25.813 --> 07:28.814
You mean the intimacy level
was a little...

07:28.816 --> 07:30.549
It was great at first,

07:30.551 --> 07:33.985
but then five, six months ago,
she weirded out.

07:33.987 --> 07:36.154
Holding hands became
a big deal.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.956
Did you talk about it?

07:37.958 --> 07:40.492
She said she was seeing
someone about it.

07:40.494 --> 07:41.860
A shrink?

07:41.862 --> 07:45.197
She started seeing one
before we broke up.

07:45.199 --> 07:46.631
You know who he was?

07:46.633 --> 07:50.502
Uh... Seliger.
Up at P and S.

07:51.472 --> 07:56.508
Unfortunately, it falls
under the category of privilege.

07:56.510 --> 07:57.609
Whose?

07:57.611 --> 07:59.511
I mean, the girl's dead.

07:59.513 --> 08:03.181
Privilege does survive the death
of a patient, Detective.

08:03.183 --> 08:05.217
Does that include
prescription history?

08:05.219 --> 08:09.154
Priscilla asked me for something
a few weeks ago.

08:09.156 --> 08:13.525
I told her I didn't think
that it was necessary.

08:13.527 --> 08:16.895
Her friends are telling us she
didn't even like pain killers.

08:16.897 --> 08:20.198
I'd say
that was an accurate assessment.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.933
Really,

08:21.935 --> 08:24.202
I wish I could help.

08:24.204 --> 08:26.104
Doctor, we understand that.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.607
Now, bottom line,

08:28.608 --> 08:31.109
we just want to know
who can waive that privilege.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.545
If the court appoints
a personal representative,

08:33.547 --> 08:36.248
they could sign a waiver
on Priscilla's behalf.

08:36.250 --> 08:37.916
Oh.

08:37.918 --> 08:41.253
It would probably be...

08:41.255 --> 08:43.154
her mother.

08:44.124 --> 08:48.226
MRS. BLAINE:
I just don't understand.

08:48.228 --> 08:54.566
If Priscilla had problems,
she knew she could come to me.

08:54.568 --> 08:56.535
Mrs. Blaine,

08:56.537 --> 09:00.105
as parents, we all want
to feel that way

09:00.107 --> 09:04.142
but they all have things
they don't want to tell us.

09:04.144 --> 09:07.245
I used to brush her hair
every night.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.681
She'd tell me about her day--

09:09.683 --> 09:12.317
all the little details.

09:12.319 --> 09:14.319
A hundred strokes.

09:16.123 --> 09:19.257
She had hair like Rita Hayworth.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.293
Did she cut it recently?

09:21.295 --> 09:25.330
Sometimes children
don't appreciate what they have.

09:27.267 --> 09:33.605
Mrs. Blaine, Dr. Seliger may be
the only person who can tell us

09:33.607 --> 09:36.341
if Priscilla's death
was accidental or not

09:36.343 --> 09:39.210
but he can't tell us anything

09:39.212 --> 09:42.614
unless the administrator
of Priscilla's estate

09:42.616 --> 09:45.717
waives the patient-doctor
confidentiality.

09:45.719 --> 09:50.121
Maybe it's not anybody's
business what they talked about.

09:50.123 --> 09:53.592
She didn't want me to know
when she was alive.

09:53.594 --> 09:57.162
I don't see any reason
to change that now.

10:03.070 --> 10:06.171
My mother got pregnant
with me when she was 17.

10:06.173 --> 10:09.174
I kind of put the brakes
on her career.

10:09.176 --> 10:11.109
She was an actress?

10:11.111 --> 10:14.212
She was a pretty woman
with a fair voice,

10:14.214 --> 10:17.282
whose main claim to fame
was Eliza Doolittle

10:17.284 --> 10:20.285
at the Bloomfield
Community Playhouse.

10:20.287 --> 10:23.688
We haven't spoken
in two years...

10:23.690 --> 10:25.256
until this.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.193
Why the rift?

10:28.195 --> 10:32.163
Well, 12 years of dance class,
three times a week,

10:32.165 --> 10:36.067
and acting class twice a week
is a bit wearing.

10:36.069 --> 10:39.070
My mother couldn't decide
if I was Martha Graham

10:39.072 --> 10:40.171
or Helen Hayes.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.073
And which were you?

10:42.075 --> 10:44.643
I was Patti Blaine.

10:44.645 --> 10:48.079
So I got out before I wasn't.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.248
And Priscilla?

10:50.250 --> 10:54.219
Since she was three--
lessons, agents.

10:54.221 --> 10:57.288
Kind of like the last hope.

10:57.290 --> 11:00.358
She never even knew
she had a choice.

11:00.360 --> 11:04.195
Your mother's a sales clerk,
isn't that right?

11:04.197 --> 11:06.698
This academy must be
pretty expensive.

11:06.700 --> 11:09.100
Priscilla helped
with the tuition.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.201
Oh?

11:10.203 --> 11:12.370
Our father died
when we were young

11:12.372 --> 11:15.040
and he left us some money.

11:15.042 --> 11:18.243
You and your sister
stayed pretty close?

11:18.245 --> 11:21.212
We talked
a couple times a month.

11:21.214 --> 11:24.115
Just, "Hi. How are you?"

11:24.117 --> 11:25.150
Nothing big.

11:25.152 --> 11:27.152
When was the last time?

11:27.154 --> 11:29.120
About a week ago.

11:29.122 --> 11:33.758
It never sounded like
anything was wrong.

11:38.398 --> 11:42.233
Not much of a big sister.

11:42.235 --> 11:45.070
Who<i> did</i> she
talk to, Patti?

11:47.074 --> 11:49.074
Probably Jasmine.

11:49.076 --> 11:51.142
They grew up together.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.245
Maybe we never really knew her.

11:54.247 --> 11:57.048
Some of the stuff she pulled
was confusing.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.651
Like what?

11:59.652 --> 12:02.253
She faked hurting her ankle
to get out of some big show.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.722
Why?

12:03.724 --> 12:05.724
Didn't she want
to dance anymore?

12:05.726 --> 12:07.225
I don't know.

12:07.227 --> 12:10.295
She always thought everyone
was better than she was.

12:10.297 --> 12:11.730
LOGAN:
Were they?

12:11.732 --> 12:13.364
Priscilla was good.

12:13.366 --> 12:16.367
She had to work
at everything she got.

12:16.369 --> 12:19.070
Now, her sister
was the natural.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.239
She did everything
better than Priscilla

12:21.241 --> 12:25.176
with half the effort,
and she just shined it on.

12:25.178 --> 12:26.344
She didn't want it.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.346
Maybe, in a weird way,

12:28.348 --> 12:31.149
she had more guts
than Priscilla.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.284
Did Priscilla
ever give you

12:33.286 --> 12:36.121
any indication that
she was unhappy?

12:36.123 --> 12:38.189
I don't think
Priscilla knew

12:38.191 --> 12:40.325
whether or not
she was unhappy.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.127
She was probably happiest

12:42.129 --> 12:45.330
when she was
pleasing her mother.

12:45.332 --> 12:47.899
And lately?

12:47.901 --> 12:50.435
Lately she just wasn't herself.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.303
Pressured, absentminded.

12:52.305 --> 12:56.307
She even left her backpack here
a couple of times

12:56.309 --> 12:59.277
and that's
certainly not like her.

13:01.848 --> 13:03.348
This one?

13:03.350 --> 13:07.185
She spends her life
trying to replace her sister.

13:07.187 --> 13:10.188
She couldn't take the pressure,
and checks out.

13:10.190 --> 13:13.224
Why is she found kneeling
by an unhooked phone

13:13.226 --> 13:16.161
moaning, "I didn't
want to do it"?

13:16.163 --> 13:17.295
She changed her mind

13:17.297 --> 13:19.898
or she's talking about
show biz stuff.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.366
But not about the drugs?

13:21.368 --> 13:23.968
She'd do anything
to please other people.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.971
Are you saying she got
talked into partying?

13:26.973 --> 13:29.240
She's much
too anti-drugs.

13:29.242 --> 13:30.441
Maybe. Maybe not.

13:30.443 --> 13:33.244
How anxious was she to please?

13:33.246 --> 13:36.347
A kid, when I was growing up,
in Little League--

13:36.349 --> 13:40.251
his old man, every game,
was yelling orders at him.

13:40.253 --> 13:41.252
So?

13:41.254 --> 13:42.453
A game
before play-off,

13:42.455 --> 13:45.256
the kid hits a dink
to shortstop.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.892
He dives headfirst
into first base.

13:47.894 --> 13:50.111
Dislocated his shoulder.

13:50.112 --> 13:52.329
You're saying a ten-year-old
intentionally hurt himself?

13:52.332 --> 13:53.865
It's subconscious.

13:53.867 --> 13:56.234
He couldn't take the pressure.

13:56.236 --> 13:59.504
My mother hounded me
to practice the piano.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.840
I wish I had learned.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.908
You'll make your kids do things
they don't want to?

14:03.910 --> 14:05.443
From the moment
they're on earth.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.312
Brush your teeth, do your
homework, you're grounded...

14:07.314 --> 14:08.479
That's different.

14:08.481 --> 14:11.282
It's just a matter of degree.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.890
What the hell's that?

14:18.892 --> 14:20.391
Unlabeled.

14:21.494 --> 14:23.027
Yeah.

14:23.029 --> 14:23.962
Ohh.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.230
Right here.

14:25.232 --> 14:26.865
Ohh.

14:26.867 --> 14:29.968
Ohh.

14:29.970 --> 14:32.303
LOGAN:
That's her.

14:32.305 --> 14:35.206
Your girl had a shadow life.

14:35.208 --> 14:38.643
Good bet on where
the drugs came from, huh?

14:38.645 --> 14:40.645
CRAGEN:
Who knows about it?

14:40.647 --> 14:42.647
Jasmine? Her boyfriend?

14:42.649 --> 14:44.649
LOGAN:
Maybe none of them.

14:44.651 --> 14:47.652

about this company--

14:47.654 --> 14:49.320
Candlelight Productions.

14:49.322 --> 14:52.590
No one knows
anybody anymore.

14:52.592 --> 14:55.326
We may know one thing--

14:55.328 --> 14:59.297
what "I didn't want
to do it" means.

15:05.972 --> 15:08.606
Candlelight Productions
went out of business

15:08.608 --> 15:10.642
six weeks ago.

15:11.645 --> 15:12.677
What?

15:12.679 --> 15:16.581
She's been meeting
someone named J.Z.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.616
Two or three
times a week.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.652
Could be a nickname for Jasmine.

15:20.654 --> 15:22.253
I don't think so.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.989
It only shows up six months ago.

15:24.991 --> 15:26.958
Before that, nothing.

15:28.595 --> 15:32.263
I never heard
of anyone named J.Z.

15:32.265 --> 15:35.266
LOGAN:
She never
mentioned anything?

15:35.268 --> 15:37.635
Six months,
two, three times a week

15:37.637 --> 15:39.671
and you didn't know anything?

15:39.673 --> 15:41.673
CERRETA:
Jasmine...

15:41.675 --> 15:44.309
Priscilla is dead.

15:44.310 --> 15:46.944
Any secrets she had
are no longer worth keeping.

15:48.581 --> 15:50.315
(<i> heavy sigh</i> )

15:51.685 --> 15:55.219
He owns a club in Chelsea--

15:55.221 --> 15:57.221
flash dancers.

15:57.223 --> 15:59.324
A strip joint?

15:59.326 --> 16:01.292
It's not
a dirt palace.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.627
Just businessmen.

16:02.629 --> 16:06.230
Yuppies out for a good time,
that kind of thing.

16:06.232 --> 16:08.599
I was the only one who knew.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.735
Knew what--
that she worked there?

16:10.737 --> 16:12.704
It was good money--

16:12.706 --> 16:15.473
<i> really</i> good money.

16:15.475 --> 16:19.277
She was trying to earn enough
to move out.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.712
Whatever she did,

16:20.714 --> 16:23.581
I don't want
to know about it.

16:23.583 --> 16:26.050
She give you
a lot of trouble?

16:26.052 --> 16:27.251
They all do.

16:27.253 --> 16:28.586
It's like baby-sitting.

16:28.588 --> 16:29.654
Come on, girls.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.556
Come on, come on.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.224
This one though...

16:33.226 --> 16:34.592
(<i> sighs</i> )

16:34.594 --> 16:36.627
she could
really shake it.

16:36.629 --> 16:38.596
When did she stop working?

16:38.598 --> 16:40.765
I haven't seen her
in three months.

16:40.767 --> 16:43.067
She was getting film interest.

16:43.069 --> 16:45.536
The good ones--
they're tough to keep.

16:45.538 --> 16:47.605
Suddenly, they don't show up.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.073
And when they do,
they're lit, right?

16:49.075 --> 16:50.708
You got to figure

16:50.710 --> 16:53.344
there's a lot of drugs
in and out of here.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.613
Whatever the girls do.

16:55.615 --> 16:58.616
What kind of film interest
was Priscilla getting?

16:58.618 --> 17:00.618
Do you know the people?

17:00.620 --> 17:03.254
We're not talking
Cecil B. Demille.

17:03.256 --> 17:05.256
They're around all the time.

17:05.258 --> 17:07.058
I don't associate with them.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.493
It's not my trade.

17:08.495 --> 17:10.595
J.Z., help us out here.

17:10.597 --> 17:14.599
You must know somebody
we could talk to

17:14.601 --> 17:16.667
who might know
these people.

17:16.669 --> 17:19.070
Yeah, there's a guy.

17:19.072 --> 17:21.572
His name is Ed Zakaris.

17:21.574 --> 17:22.707
He's a pig.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.476
Candlelight Productions, uh...

17:25.478 --> 17:27.078
never heard of them.

17:27.080 --> 17:29.580
Maybe it went
by a different name.

17:29.582 --> 17:30.782
If I didn't hear...

17:30.784 --> 17:32.650
Look, we saw the tape.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.452
Yeah?

17:34.454 --> 17:36.554
Wouldn't be surprised.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.556
How did it get
past you, Ed?

17:38.558 --> 17:41.526
Look, these businesses
are fly-by-night.

17:41.528 --> 17:42.827
They grab some jerk.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.762
He invests in their flick.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.631
They make it.

17:46.633 --> 17:47.832
They close.

17:47.834 --> 17:51.302
They open up next week--
new name.

17:51.304 --> 17:52.537
Candlelight.

17:52.539 --> 17:53.538
Flashlight.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.573
Whatever.

17:55.574 --> 17:57.607
What about this director--
Franklin Fromm?

17:57.610 --> 17:59.744
He was one
of the great ones.

17:59.746 --> 18:03.648
He won the Best Actor Award
ina Group Scene-- 1975.

18:03.650 --> 18:04.849
That's terrific.

18:04.851 --> 18:07.685
Mr. Olivier's address.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.821
Did she work
in your films?

18:09.823 --> 18:11.556
Oh, yeah, sure.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.558
The one with the mother.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.093
You know her mother?

18:17.097 --> 18:19.530
Elizabeth.

18:19.532 --> 18:20.631
Mrs. Blaine knew

18:20.633 --> 18:22.667
that Priscilla
worked for you?

18:22.669 --> 18:24.636
She set it up.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.604
I thought you found Priscilla
at flash dancers?

18:26.606 --> 18:28.573
Yeah, I gave her my card.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.842
Next thing, her mom
gives me a call.

18:30.844 --> 18:33.811
Does she know what kind
of films you make?

18:33.813 --> 18:36.714
Dropped her off,
watched us shoot.

18:36.716 --> 18:39.550
Must have cooled off the set.

18:39.552 --> 18:40.718
She kept
her distance.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.554
Didn't even want her kid
talking

18:43.556 --> 18:45.823
to the other
actresses.

18:45.825 --> 18:49.594
What about when
Mom wasn't around?

18:51.498 --> 18:52.797
It's just...

18:52.799 --> 18:55.633
it's just so hard to believe.

18:55.635 --> 18:59.737
I mean, I was the one
that was supposed to die.

18:59.739 --> 19:02.740
I tested positive last month.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.614
(<i> sighs</i> )

19:09.616 --> 19:11.516
It's a cost of business.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.484
I made 1,000 bucks a day.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.553
Priscilla make
that kind of cash?

19:15.555 --> 19:16.621
No.

19:16.623 --> 19:18.623
She was just foreplay.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.625
She never went all the way.

19:20.627 --> 19:22.627
Her mom wouldn't let her.

19:22.629 --> 19:23.861
Girl's in

19:23.863 --> 19:25.530
a prestigious school.

19:25.532 --> 19:26.631
Why do porno?

19:26.633 --> 19:28.833
It wasn't her, it was her mom.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.635
You believe that?

19:30.637 --> 19:34.539
I mean, just pushing, pushing,
you know?

19:34.541 --> 19:35.840
Priscilla was shy.

19:35.842 --> 19:38.509
It was hard for her.

19:38.511 --> 19:41.812
I mean, a few times,
she got so nervous she cried.

19:41.814 --> 19:45.416
Would nervous actresses
drop something?

19:45.418 --> 19:48.519
Well, I did, when I was working.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.489
It made me forget
what I was doing.

19:51.491 --> 19:52.823
What was it, amitripty...?

19:52.825 --> 19:54.592
Amitriptyline.

19:54.594 --> 19:55.560
Trips.

19:55.562 --> 19:57.795
I couldn't go on without it.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.664
Did Priscilla use this?

19:59.666 --> 20:02.800
Well, I told her
it would help her relax.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.502
LOGAN:
You gave her

20:04.504 --> 20:05.636
the drugs?

20:05.638 --> 20:08.606
I said never to take
more than one.

20:08.608 --> 20:09.607
She took eight.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.542
Well, uh...

20:11.544 --> 20:13.511
she must have been freaked.

20:13.513 --> 20:16.548
I mean...

20:16.549 --> 20:19.584
It was this new flick
she was going to be starring in.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.252
Starring, huh?

20:21.254 --> 20:23.754
You mean no more foreplay?

20:23.756 --> 20:26.557
Her mother knew what
she would have to do?

20:26.559 --> 20:28.492
Well, she'd been on sets.

20:28.494 --> 20:30.878
I mean, she knew

20:30.879 --> 20:33.263
people didn't pay
to see the stars hold hands.

20:33.266 --> 20:35.700
Angel admitted to giving
Priscilla the drugs?

20:35.702 --> 20:37.568
You want to charge her?

20:37.570 --> 20:38.703
Let's cut her a deal.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.571
She'll testify
Mommy Dearest

20:40.573 --> 20:42.506
forced her daughter
into pornography.

20:42.508 --> 20:45.576
You want to charge the mother
with murder?

20:45.578 --> 20:47.311
It was a suicide.

20:47.313 --> 20:49.480
Brought on by doing porno

20:49.482 --> 20:51.549
which the mother
forced her into.

20:51.551 --> 20:53.584
"I didn't want to do it..."
over and over again.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.720
Come on, Mike!
That could mean a lot of things.

20:55.722 --> 20:59.724
The most probable being she was
freaked out by the porno.

20:59.726 --> 21:02.526
Well, it's a
dying utterance.

21:02.528 --> 21:05.863
It's admissable, but only
for what it's worth.

21:05.865 --> 21:08.032
So, what do you think?

21:08.034 --> 21:12.536
We could take a run at "depraved
indifference to human life."

21:12.538 --> 21:15.339
Suicide was the
inevitable consequence.

21:15.341 --> 21:18.676
You don't believe
she's guilty, do you?

21:18.678 --> 21:20.811
Of being a rotten mother, yes.

21:20.813 --> 21:25.049
But if a kid robs a bank,
you put the parents in jail?

21:25.051 --> 21:28.352
Maybe, if there was
cause and effect.

21:28.354 --> 21:29.687
She was 19.

21:29.689 --> 21:31.522
She could have left home.

21:31.524 --> 21:32.690
She did not have

21:32.692 --> 21:34.625
to kill herself.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.894
Maybe she did.

of Priscilla Blaine.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.375

manslaughter
in the first and second degree,

and criminally
negligent homicide.

22:05.591 --> 22:07.658
How does the
defendant plead?

22:07.660 --> 22:09.660
Not guilty.

22:09.662 --> 22:12.563
Your Honor, the People

22:36.122 --> 22:38.389

22:38.391 --> 22:40.725
to make the films
against her will,

22:40.727 --> 22:43.828
you'll still have
a hell of a time proving

22:43.830 --> 22:47.732
that was the proximate cause
of the girl's death.

a girl is kidnapped,

22:52.472 --> 22:55.139
A year later,
she took poison and died.

22:55.141 --> 22:58.042
The court ruled the conduct
of her assailant

22:58.044 --> 23:00.644
was the proximate cause
of her death.

intervening act.

23:07.420 --> 23:11.822
Therefore, the mother's actions,
no matter how despicable,

23:11.824 --> 23:15.393
are not the cause-in-fact
of the girl's death.

23:15.395 --> 23:19.864
Unless we can prove that
Mrs. Blaine knew the films

23:19.866 --> 23:22.166
were making Priscilla
suicidal.

23:22.168 --> 23:25.436
Mr. Robinette,
I'm sure you know

23:25.438 --> 23:27.138
that I can't possibly...

23:27.140 --> 23:28.439
I know the difference

23:28.441 --> 23:31.142
between real patients

23:31.144 --> 23:34.111
and hypothetical ones.

23:34.113 --> 23:37.448
All right.

23:37.449 --> 23:40.784
One<i> could</i> argue that
such a hypothetical patient

23:40.787 --> 23:43.187
might be an exhibitionist

23:43.189 --> 23:47.057
and there was nothing
anyone could have done

23:47.059 --> 23:48.893
to prevent her death.

23:48.895 --> 23:51.796
But if she were forced
by someone--

23:51.798 --> 23:55.199
a loved one,
husband, parent...?

23:55.201 --> 23:58.803
Being forced
into the sordid life

23:58.805 --> 24:00.204
by someone she loved

24:00.206 --> 24:04.141
could be so deleterious
to her mental health

24:04.143 --> 24:05.810
that it had to be

24:05.812 --> 24:09.213
a substantial and contributory
cause of suicide.

24:09.215 --> 24:12.082
And you've dealt
with patients

24:12.084 --> 24:13.184
or a patient

24:13.186 --> 24:16.153
who's had
similar pressure?

24:16.155 --> 24:21.492
Yes... I have.

24:21.494 --> 24:24.995
He's got a lot to say...
only he can't say it.

24:24.997 --> 24:27.798
Privilege can be waived.

24:27.800 --> 24:31.135
By the administrator
of the decedent's estate.

24:31.137 --> 24:34.138
Mrs. Blaine already
applied for letters.

24:34.140 --> 24:37.241
Priscilla had money
her father left her.

24:37.243 --> 24:40.845
The bank won't release it
without tax waivers.

24:40.847 --> 24:43.147
Return date's next week.

24:43.149 --> 24:47.551
Mrs. Blaine is charged
with killing her daughter.

24:47.553 --> 24:49.153
I'd say her interests

24:49.155 --> 24:52.156
are adverse
to that of the estate.

24:52.158 --> 24:54.258
There's a sister, isn't there?

24:55.995 --> 25:00.064
You know
any good probate lawyers?

25:00.066 --> 25:02.199
Would I have to go to court?

25:02.201 --> 25:06.270
Surrogate court appoints
the administrator of an estate

25:06.272 --> 25:07.605
when there's no will.

25:07.607 --> 25:10.140
And that would
give you the authority

25:10.142 --> 25:13.043
to waive
the doctor-patient privilege.

25:13.045 --> 25:14.845
If Dr. Seliger

25:14.847 --> 25:17.548
takes the stand,
it will be the closest thing

25:17.550 --> 25:20.150
to Priscilla
being there herself.

25:20.152 --> 25:23.821
STONE:
This is not easy,
what we're asking.

25:23.823 --> 25:27.157
You want me to testify
against my mother.

25:27.159 --> 25:30.027
It's not
a criminal proceeding.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.162
It's a civil hearing.

25:32.164 --> 25:35.599
One thing I learned growing up

25:35.601 --> 25:39.169
and that's
you don't cross my mother.

25:39.171 --> 25:41.572
Priscilla knew that too.

25:41.574 --> 25:47.177
I can't help but wonder
if I hadn't have left...

25:47.179 --> 25:49.113
if I didn't quit...

25:49.115 --> 25:52.816
Your leaving is not the cause
of Priscilla's death.

25:52.818 --> 25:56.253
I believe you know
what caused your sister's death.

25:56.255 --> 25:59.290
I'm just asking
for the legal right

25:59.292 --> 26:01.659
to get to the truth.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.600
Petition for letters
of administration

26:09.602 --> 26:12.036
in the Estate
of Priscilla Blaine.

26:12.038 --> 26:13.571
Objections filed
by Partricia Blaine.

26:13.573 --> 26:15.857
Objections filed

26:15.858 --> 26:18.142
on the grounds that
the applicant's appointment

26:18.144 --> 26:21.078
would not be
in the best interest

26:21.080 --> 26:22.830
of the estate.

26:22.831 --> 26:24.581
You Honor, the D.A. is
using the proceedings

26:24.584 --> 26:26.116
to mount a witch hunt.

26:26.118 --> 26:29.620
I'm here to represent
Ms. Blaine, not the D.A.

26:29.622 --> 26:31.689
Are the parties prepared?

26:31.691 --> 26:33.157
Ready, Your Honor.

26:33.159 --> 26:34.959
Ready.

26:34.961 --> 26:37.094
Does the District Attorney's
Office

26:37.096 --> 26:40.130
have charges pending
against the petitioner?

26:40.132 --> 26:41.131
Yes, we do.

26:41.133 --> 26:43.267
What are
those charges?

26:43.269 --> 26:46.704
She's been indicted
for the murder of her daughter.

26:46.706 --> 26:49.139
An indictment
is not a conviction

26:49.141 --> 26:52.109
and no evidence
of my client's guilt.

26:52.111 --> 26:56.046
The grand jury is nothing more
than a D.A.'s puppet.

26:56.048 --> 26:58.516
Enough, Mr. Pollard.

26:58.517 --> 27:00.985
The court takes judicial notice
of the indictment.

27:00.987 --> 27:05.189
Patti:
When we were little,
she had us both taking lessons,

27:05.191 --> 27:07.224
trying to get an agent.

27:07.226 --> 27:08.258
How old were you?

27:08.260 --> 27:09.259
Five.

27:09.261 --> 27:11.161
And Priscilla?

27:11.163 --> 27:12.396
She was three.

27:12.398 --> 27:14.999
Was this something

27:15.001 --> 27:16.333
you both enjoyed?

27:16.335 --> 27:19.036
I didn't.

27:19.038 --> 27:22.373
And your sister,
Priscilla?

27:22.375 --> 27:25.075
It was harder for her.

27:25.077 --> 27:27.177
I left, and after that,

27:27.179 --> 27:30.280
Priscilla was expected
to fill that void.

27:30.282 --> 27:34.118
I see. And what did
these expectations entail?

27:34.120 --> 27:36.654
Well, when she was five,

27:36.656 --> 27:40.157
she had dance class
three times a week after school

27:40.159 --> 27:42.960
and Saturdays
from 1:00 to 5:00.

27:42.962 --> 27:46.196
Did Priscilla
ever express to you

27:46.198 --> 27:49.033
that she was unhappy?

27:49.035 --> 27:54.438
Once she lost an audition
for<i> The Nutcracker Suite.</i>

27:54.440 --> 27:58.175
My mother was very upset.

27:58.177 --> 28:01.245
It was always like that.

28:01.247 --> 28:03.247
That night,
when we got home,

28:03.249 --> 28:04.982
Priscilla asked me

28:04.984 --> 28:07.284
did I think Mom didn't
love her anymore.

28:07.286 --> 28:09.253
Objection. Hearsay.

28:09.255 --> 28:11.255
Sustained.

28:11.257 --> 28:14.191
MELNICK:
Patti, tell the court

28:14.193 --> 28:17.361
why you would like
to be appointed administrator

28:17.363 --> 28:19.263
of your sister's estate.

28:19.265 --> 28:25.135
Because, in my opinion,
my mother is unfit.

28:25.137 --> 28:27.237
Do you believe
your mother

28:27.239 --> 28:31.008
was responsible
for Priscilla's death?

28:33.079 --> 28:35.212
Yes, I do.

28:35.214 --> 28:37.314
Thank you.

28:37.316 --> 28:39.383
No further questions.

28:50.396 --> 28:54.331
Aside from when Priscilla
was a five-year-old,

28:54.333 --> 28:57.101
did she ever tell you

28:57.103 --> 29:00.237
that your mother
treated her badly?

29:00.239 --> 29:03.040
No.

29:03.042 --> 29:05.242
Did she tell you
your mother forced her

29:05.244 --> 29:07.144
to make pornographic films?

29:07.146 --> 29:09.313
We didn't discuss...

29:09.315 --> 29:12.349
Did she say your mother made her
do anything she didn't want to?

29:12.351 --> 29:14.051
Not in those words.

29:14.053 --> 29:16.654
When you told her

29:16.655 --> 29:19.256
that you thought your mother
was pushing her too hard,

29:19.258 --> 29:21.859
she got angry at you,
isn't that true?

29:21.861 --> 29:22.860
Yes, but she...

29:22.862 --> 29:24.495
Patti...

29:24.496 --> 29:26.129
who will receive
Priscilla's money

29:26.132 --> 29:28.432
if your mother is convicted?

29:31.170 --> 29:32.870
I will.

29:32.872 --> 29:35.172
I see.

29:35.174 --> 29:40.144
And how long has it been
since you've seen your sister?

29:40.146 --> 29:42.813
Well, we talked
every couple of weeks.

29:42.815 --> 29:44.815
The last time you<i> saw</i> her?

29:44.817 --> 29:49.353
It's been about two years.

29:49.355 --> 29:51.355
So you were very devoted.

29:51.357 --> 29:53.423
You came to her funeral

29:53.425 --> 29:55.325
and to collect an inheritance.

29:55.327 --> 29:57.127
Objection, Your Honor.

29:58.397 --> 30:01.165
She wanted to be an actress.

30:01.167 --> 30:04.168
I did too, when I was her age,

30:04.170 --> 30:07.838
only I didn't have someone
to encourage me.

30:07.840 --> 30:10.908
I wanted it
to be different for her.

30:10.910 --> 30:13.177
But why these films?

30:13.179 --> 30:14.845
She wanted to act
for the cameras.

30:14.847 --> 30:18.115
They weren't giving her that
in school.

30:18.117 --> 30:20.150
There's a difference
between acting

30:20.152 --> 30:22.820
and acting
in a pornographic film.

30:22.822 --> 30:27.090
All she did
was take off her clothes.

30:27.092 --> 30:30.394
Did Priscilla ever do anything
more than undress

30:30.396 --> 30:32.329
in front of the camera?

30:32.331 --> 30:34.832
It never went further than that.

30:34.834 --> 30:36.600
I made sure of that.

30:36.602 --> 30:38.368
Thank you,
Mrs. Blaine.

30:38.370 --> 30:42.139
Ask her about
the next starring part.

30:54.620 --> 30:57.855
Mrs. Blaine, Priscilla
was going to star

30:57.857 --> 31:00.891
in an upcoming film,
wasn't she?

31:00.893 --> 31:02.159
Yes.

31:02.161 --> 31:03.961
And as the star in that film,

31:03.963 --> 31:08.365
she would have to do more
than take off her clothes, true?

31:08.367 --> 31:10.200
They told Marilyn Monroe

31:10.202 --> 31:13.203
that nude calendar
would ruin her career.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.239
It made her a star.

31:15.241 --> 31:17.941
Would you tell us,
please, Mrs. Blaine

31:17.943 --> 31:19.276
was Priscilla nervous

31:19.278 --> 31:22.946
about starring
in a pornographic film?

31:22.948 --> 31:26.617
All actresses are nervous
before a big part.

31:26.619 --> 31:29.586
But when Priscilla
told you she was nervous,

31:29.588 --> 31:31.622
what did you say to her?

31:31.624 --> 31:35.425
I told her she should talk
to her friend, Angel.

31:35.427 --> 31:37.928
She'd made a lot of films.

31:37.930 --> 31:39.263
Did it occur to you

31:39.265 --> 31:40.664
that a pornographic film

31:40.666 --> 31:44.568
might not be in your daughter's
best interest?

31:44.570 --> 31:46.370
Priscilla was an adult.

31:46.372 --> 31:49.206
She made her own decisions.
I did nothing wrong!

31:49.208 --> 31:51.275
You encouraged her
to prostitute...

31:51.277 --> 31:52.609
I encouraged her

31:52.611 --> 31:55.946
to do exactly
what she wanted to do!

32:05.224 --> 32:07.224
Be seated.

32:10.029 --> 32:14.564
The particulars of this case
are repugnant to me.

32:14.566 --> 32:16.967
Frankly, I don't think

32:16.969 --> 32:18.702
either of the applicants

32:18.704 --> 32:22.306
are fit administrators
of Priscilla Blaine's estate.

32:22.308 --> 32:24.341
It's also clear

32:24.342 --> 32:26.375
the prosecutor's office
is using this proceeding

32:26.378 --> 32:27.978
to reach its own goals.

32:27.980 --> 32:30.580
However, I cannot,
in good conscience

32:30.582 --> 32:35.252
ignore the criminal charges
against the applicant.

32:37.222 --> 32:39.957
I'm going to sign an order
issuing letters

32:39.959 --> 32:41.058
to the objectant,

32:41.060 --> 32:42.693
Patricia Blaine.

32:42.695 --> 32:45.629
This hearing is adjourned.

33:07.453 --> 33:11.088
What are some of the effects
of amitriptyline?

33:11.090 --> 33:12.422
Alleviates
nervous tension--

33:12.424 --> 33:14.324
symptoms of depression.

33:14.326 --> 33:16.226
And in larger dosages?

33:16.228 --> 33:17.294
Reduced inhibitions.

33:17.296 --> 33:19.396
May evoke
a state of euphoria.

33:19.398 --> 33:21.698
What is
the prescribed dosage?

33:21.700 --> 33:24.134
25 milligrams
three times a day,

33:24.136 --> 33:26.703
to a maximum of 150 milligrams
as necessary.

33:26.705 --> 33:29.139
There are 25 milligrams
to each tablet?

33:29.141 --> 33:30.808
Yes.

33:30.809 --> 33:32.476
How much did Miss Blaine
take the night she died?

33:32.478 --> 33:35.412
Over 200 milligrams.

33:35.414 --> 33:37.114
That's at least
eight tablets.

33:37.116 --> 33:38.348
Yes.

33:38.350 --> 33:39.683
Was there evidence

33:39.685 --> 33:41.485
to indicate
if Miss Blaine

33:41.487 --> 33:43.253
was an habitual user?

33:43.255 --> 33:46.289
The corrosive appearance
of the stomach lining

33:46.291 --> 33:48.358
and partially digested tablets

33:48.360 --> 33:51.495
suggests that her system
didn't easily absorb the drug.

33:51.497 --> 33:53.363
If I'm a vegetarian

33:53.365 --> 33:56.133
and one night I eat a steak,

33:56.135 --> 33:59.236
my body has a hard time
digesting it, right?

33:59.238 --> 34:00.370
Something like that.

34:00.372 --> 34:02.139
So it's probable

34:02.141 --> 34:04.241
that Miss Blaine
was not an abuser?

34:04.243 --> 34:05.275
Correct.

34:05.277 --> 34:08.278
If she had wanted
an extra kick,

34:08.280 --> 34:09.312
50 milligrams
would have sufficed?

34:09.314 --> 34:11.248
That's correct.

34:11.250 --> 34:13.450
So in your expert opinion,
Doctor,

34:13.452 --> 34:16.720
why would Miss Blaine
have taken eight tablets?

34:18.524 --> 34:20.357
To die.

34:22.261 --> 34:24.461
I told her never
to take more than one.

34:24.463 --> 34:26.696
Had Priscilla asked
for drugs before?

34:26.698 --> 34:29.699
No, and I had never
offered them.

34:29.701 --> 34:32.235
Did she say why
she wanted the drugs?

34:32.237 --> 34:34.404
She was nervous
about the new film.

34:34.406 --> 34:37.274
The one she was going
to star in?

34:37.276 --> 34:38.442
Yes.

34:38.444 --> 34:40.177
Why was she nervous?

34:40.179 --> 34:43.346
She didn't think
she could go through with it.

34:43.348 --> 34:45.816
Go through with what,
Miss Greer?

34:45.818 --> 34:48.418
Having sex in front of a camera.

34:48.420 --> 34:52.556
So she needed the drugs
to help her do that?

34:52.558 --> 34:55.225
Yes.

34:55.227 --> 34:56.193
Thank you.

34:56.195 --> 34:58.328
No further questions.

35:03.469 --> 35:06.369
You and Priscilla
were good friends?

35:06.371 --> 35:09.306
We were friendly.

35:09.308 --> 35:11.174
Just friendly?

35:11.176 --> 35:14.111
Her mom didn't want us
getting too close.

35:14.113 --> 35:16.213
In fact,
didn't Mrs. Blaine

35:16.215 --> 35:17.447
discourage Priscilla

35:17.449 --> 35:20.250
from spending any time
with you at all?

35:20.252 --> 35:21.451
Yes.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.220
Why was that, Angel?

35:23.222 --> 35:27.257
She knew that I took drugs.

35:27.259 --> 35:29.226
And she didn't want Priscilla

35:29.228 --> 35:32.229
associating with people
who took drugs,

35:32.231 --> 35:33.497
isn't that right?

35:33.499 --> 35:37.300
Yes.

35:40.405 --> 35:43.173
When did Priscilla
start working for you?

35:43.175 --> 35:44.541
It was late February.

35:44.543 --> 35:46.476
How many
of these films

35:46.478 --> 35:48.311
did she appear in?

35:48.313 --> 35:49.312
Four...

35:49.314 --> 35:50.347
no, five.

35:50.349 --> 35:52.449
Was she featured
in any of these?

35:52.451 --> 35:53.483
No.

35:53.485 --> 35:55.452
Yet she was going to, I quote:

35:55.454 --> 35:57.888
"star in your next film"

35:57.890 --> 35:58.855
is that correct?

35:58.857 --> 36:01.375
Yeah.

36:01.376 --> 36:03.894
Did Mrs. Blaine know about that?

36:03.896 --> 36:05.428
Did she know?

36:05.430 --> 36:07.397
She wanted script approval.

36:07.399 --> 36:09.232
In your new film,

36:09.234 --> 36:13.503
was Priscilla Blaine expected
to perform sex acts on screen?

36:13.505 --> 36:15.438
Tastefully, yes.

36:18.277 --> 36:20.911
Did Mrs. Blaine know
that her daughter

36:20.913 --> 36:24.181
was expected to perform sex
on screen?

36:24.183 --> 36:26.283
She watched us shoot
for months-- she knew.

36:26.285 --> 36:28.385
When did you go
into production?

36:28.387 --> 36:30.954
We were to start shooting
June third.

36:30.956 --> 36:33.256
The morning after
Priscilla died.

36:33.258 --> 36:35.525
Yes.

36:35.527 --> 36:36.927
Thank you.

36:36.929 --> 36:38.328
No further questions.

36:41.233 --> 36:43.934
Mr. Fromm, did you
approach Priscilla

36:43.936 --> 36:46.303
about starring
in this new film?

36:46.305 --> 36:47.671
No, she came to me.

36:47.673 --> 36:48.972
Priscilla came to you

36:48.974 --> 36:51.975
and asked if she
could star in the film?

36:51.977 --> 36:53.643
Something like that.

36:53.645 --> 36:55.312
Was her mother
with her?

36:55.314 --> 36:57.447
No, she was alone.

36:57.449 --> 36:59.482
Do you have reason
to believe

36:59.484 --> 37:01.451
that Mrs. Blaine
forced her daughter

37:01.453 --> 37:03.453
to ask you
for the part?

37:03.455 --> 37:05.956
Objection,
beyond the witness's knowledge.

37:05.958 --> 37:09.426
Mr. Stone, I did permit you
great latitude.

37:09.428 --> 37:11.561
I'll allow it.

37:11.563 --> 37:13.663
She was legally an adult.

37:13.665 --> 37:16.233
If she didn't want
to do pornography,

37:16.235 --> 37:18.001
why didn't she just walk away?

37:18.003 --> 37:20.937
Her mother had total control
over her life.

37:20.939 --> 37:23.673
Priscilla was powerless
in that relationship.

37:23.675 --> 37:25.909
She dated a boy
her mother didn't like--

37:25.911 --> 37:28.011
lied to get out
of a performance

37:28.013 --> 37:30.247
and saw you without
her mother's permission.

37:30.249 --> 37:32.983
She lied because she was afraid
to confront her.

37:32.985 --> 37:34.417
She was an actress.

37:34.419 --> 37:36.987
Was it that difficult
to express herself?

37:36.989 --> 37:39.990
She was so used
to subverting her emotions.

37:39.992 --> 37:43.994
There were days
she came to my office

37:43.996 --> 37:45.895
and couldn't say a word.

37:45.897 --> 37:47.998
She found other ways.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.399
What other ways?

37:49.401 --> 37:51.001
She had, uh...

37:51.003 --> 37:53.303
long, lovely hair.

37:53.305 --> 37:56.273
She knew her mother
prized her hair.

37:56.275 --> 37:59.009
A month ago, she cut it off.

37:59.011 --> 38:02.012
Not styled-- shorn.

38:02.014 --> 38:04.047
Doctor, this is a transcript

38:04.049 --> 38:08.618
from the time you discussed
that incident with Priscilla.

38:08.620 --> 38:11.621
Would you please read
the highlighted portions

38:11.623 --> 38:13.056
out loud?

38:16.995 --> 38:21.031
Priscilla: "I started
and I just kept going."

38:21.033 --> 38:23.733
Doctor: "Why did you do it?"

38:23.735 --> 38:27.003
Priscilla:
"Maybe... I don't know.

38:27.005 --> 38:31.374
"Mom said my hair was
what sold me or something.

38:31.376 --> 38:34.377
"I thought, without the hair,
whatever...

38:34.379 --> 38:38.982
maybe she'd get it."

38:38.984 --> 38:41.384
Would you characterize
that incident

38:41.386 --> 38:43.386
as self-destructive?

38:43.388 --> 38:45.388
Cutting hair,
cutting skin...

38:45.390 --> 38:48.725
it's how some kids
get their point across.

38:48.727 --> 38:51.961
Did you believe it would lead
to more serious forms

38:51.963 --> 38:54.364
of self-destructive
behavior?

38:54.366 --> 38:55.799
It usually does.

38:55.801 --> 38:58.068
Dr. Seliger,
did Priscilla Blaine

38:58.070 --> 39:01.071
ever talk to you
about committing suicide?

39:01.073 --> 39:02.439
Indirectly.

39:02.441 --> 39:04.040
How so?

39:04.042 --> 39:08.678
She taped a monologue
from a play she did in class.

39:08.680 --> 39:11.014
What did she plan
to do with it?

39:11.016 --> 39:13.016
She gave it
to her mother.

39:13.018 --> 39:15.685
She said she hoped
she'd understand.

39:15.687 --> 39:18.121
When did she give
the tape to her mother?

39:18.123 --> 39:20.023
A week before she died.

39:20.025 --> 39:23.793
Your Honor, at this time,
I'd like to play the tape.

39:23.795 --> 39:25.912
Objection, Your Honor.

39:25.913 --> 39:28.030
Mr. Stone is insisting
the death was a suicide

39:28.033 --> 39:32.369
and is attempting to introduce
non-relevant facts.

39:32.371 --> 39:35.438
Objection's noted, Mr. Pollard.

39:35.440 --> 39:38.508
I'll allow the tape
for what it's worth.

39:49.755 --> 39:53.390
Mama... you awake?

39:56.061 --> 39:58.428
I couldn't sleep.

39:59.798 --> 40:02.832
I haven't slept in days.

40:06.738 --> 40:14.711
I looked at myself in the mirror
Last night, in the dark,

40:14.713 --> 40:21.151
were the whites of my eyes...
and all I could see

40:21.153 --> 40:26.156
I really was.
and I knew how scared

40:26.158 --> 40:29.092
Are you dreaming, Mama?

40:29.094 --> 40:34.764
Remember Abilene, Mama?

40:34.766 --> 40:38.902
How the towns clicked by

40:38.904 --> 40:43.807
to stop the train?
and I begged you

40:43.809 --> 40:49.779
Little Rock.
Lexington, Nashville,

40:49.781 --> 40:53.650
for a thousand miles...
I was sick

40:58.790 --> 41:01.191
and I hated you for it.

41:05.664 --> 41:13.770
Well, Mama, you sleep.

41:13.772 --> 41:20.877
Me, I'm getting off this train.

41:25.150 --> 41:31.788
I'm tired now, Mama.

41:31.790 --> 41:37.894
don't be angry that I'm gone.
When you wake up,

41:44.135 --> 41:47.203
It's my turn to sleep.

41:59.851 --> 42:03.620
So they might believe the girl
committed suicide

42:03.622 --> 42:05.689
but defense will appeal.

42:05.690 --> 42:07.757
Admission of the tape
was reversible error.

42:07.759 --> 42:09.993
Judge Hale
didn't think the tape

42:09.995 --> 42:11.761
was overly prejudicial.

42:11.763 --> 42:14.564
Even if she did
kill herself,

42:14.566 --> 42:17.567
it's tough to prove
that the mother's behavior

42:17.569 --> 42:19.869
was the proximate cause
of her death.

42:19.871 --> 42:21.671
The tape went a long way
to prove that.

42:21.673 --> 42:23.973
Mrs. Blaine knew
that acting in those films

42:23.975 --> 42:25.942
was making her daughter
suicidal.

42:25.944 --> 42:28.645
But if she doesn't
take the stand,

42:28.647 --> 42:30.980
you can't prove what
she knew or didn't know.

42:30.982 --> 42:32.615
Pollard's no fool.

42:32.617 --> 42:34.984
No way he's going
to put her on the stand

42:34.986 --> 42:37.320
and you won't make your case.

42:37.322 --> 42:40.924
What if it wasn't suicide
after all?

42:40.926 --> 42:42.759
At the probate hearing

42:42.761 --> 42:45.762
Mrs. Blaine said that when
Priscilla was nervous

42:45.764 --> 42:47.764
about starring in a film,

42:47.766 --> 42:50.733
she told her
to talk to Angel about it.

42:50.735 --> 42:54.637
Angel said Mrs. Blaine didn't
want Priscilla around her.

42:54.639 --> 42:57.574
Because Angel took drugs
to do films

42:57.576 --> 43:00.777
so Mrs. Blaine sent Priscilla
to Angel to get drugs

43:00.779 --> 43:02.979
to help her have sex on camera.

43:02.981 --> 43:05.682
So we change
our theory?

43:05.684 --> 43:08.751
Priscilla didn't
commit suicide,

43:08.753 --> 43:10.653
she O.D.'d?

43:10.655 --> 43:12.855
Mrs. Blaine not only
forced her daughter

43:12.857 --> 43:14.924
to have sex on camera

43:14.926 --> 43:20.930
but she gave her the drugs
to help her do that...

43:20.932 --> 43:25.969
ergo, she is guilty
of her daughter's death.

43:25.971 --> 43:28.071
And with her prior testimony,

43:28.073 --> 43:31.708
we don't even need Mrs. Blaine
on the stand.

43:31.710 --> 43:34.077
Do you believe
she committed suicide?

43:34.079 --> 43:38.748
I believe Mrs. Blaine is guilty
of her daughter's death.

43:38.750 --> 43:41.718
I'll do anything
to make it stick.

43:44.756 --> 43:46.623
It's prejudicial!

43:46.625 --> 43:48.024
It's inflammatory!

43:48.026 --> 43:51.794
I am not deciding
on decibel level, Lucas.

43:51.796 --> 43:54.030
This transcript
wouldn't prejudice a jury.

43:54.032 --> 43:56.699
What about a right
against self-incrimination?

43:56.701 --> 43:58.735
Mrs. Blaine testified
under oath.

43:58.737 --> 43:59.969
She was represented
by counsel.

43:59.971 --> 44:02.672
Her rights
were fully protected.

44:02.674 --> 44:04.707
"What did you say
to your daughter

44:04.709 --> 44:05.775
"when she told you

44:05.777 --> 44:06.876
she was nervous?"

44:06.878 --> 44:08.344
Answer, Mrs. Blaine:

44:08.346 --> 44:10.413
"I told her to talk to Angel.

44:10.415 --> 44:11.948
She made a lot of films."

44:11.950 --> 44:13.783
What's wrong with that?

44:13.785 --> 44:16.819
He's manufacturing
proximate cause.

44:19.324 --> 44:20.723
A jury could infer

44:20.725 --> 44:23.693
that the defendant
sent her daughter to Angel

44:23.695 --> 44:25.278
to get drugs.

44:25.279 --> 44:26.862
Still,
if she committed suicide...

44:26.865 --> 44:27.964
Exactly.

44:27.966 --> 44:30.667
What if she
accidentally O.D.'d?

44:30.669 --> 44:31.834
Your point being?

44:31.836 --> 44:34.003
We're in agreement
on one point--

44:34.005 --> 44:36.706
nobody knows
Priscilla's intentions.

44:36.708 --> 44:40.410
We do know that her mother
intended to get that film made,

44:40.412 --> 44:41.778
no matter what the cost.

44:41.780 --> 44:42.879
He's changing theories

44:42.881 --> 44:44.781
because he has nothing
to stand on.

44:44.783 --> 44:46.015
Oh, I think not.

44:46.017 --> 44:48.918
If you ask a jury,
they'll tell you

44:48.920 --> 44:51.421
her taped plea to her mother--

44:51.423 --> 44:54.924
the most passionate performance
of that girl's life.

44:54.926 --> 44:58.728
I see no reason
to overrule the motion.

44:58.730 --> 45:01.731
I'll allow
Mrs. Blaine's testimony

45:01.733 --> 45:03.933
to be read into evidence.

45:07.906 --> 45:11.441
I'll need ten minutes
with my client.

45:12.410 --> 45:16.446
So now you're telling me
it was an accident...

45:16.448 --> 45:20.483
and it's still my fault?

45:20.485 --> 45:22.485
I'm not a psychiatrist.

45:22.487 --> 45:24.387
I don't know
what made you

45:24.389 --> 45:27.390
push your own flesh and blood
into pornography,

45:27.392 --> 45:30.927
but I do think Priscilla's
death was your fault--

45:30.929 --> 45:32.395
both legally

45:32.397 --> 45:33.996
and morally.

45:35.500 --> 45:37.767
But I loved her.

45:39.504 --> 45:41.804
She was my life.

45:41.806 --> 45:43.806
No, she was your daughter.

45:43.808 --> 45:46.008
She had a life of her own.

45:53.918 --> 45:56.819
Criminally negligent homicide

45:56.821 --> 45:59.789
with a sentencing
recommendation.

45:59.791 --> 46:01.524
An "E" felony?

46:01.526 --> 46:04.927
She's not dangerous, Ben.

46:07.999 --> 46:12.135
Man Two?

46:12.137 --> 46:15.938
She does the max.

46:33.858 --> 46:37.460
It's kind of like
the fairy tale, isn't it?

46:37.462 --> 46:38.561
Which one?

46:38.563 --> 46:41.831
"Mirror, mirror on the wall..."

46:43.134 --> 46:46.536
She looked at her daughter
and saw herself.

46:46.538 --> 46:49.972
Somehow, I don't think
she'll ever understand

46:49.974 --> 46:51.440
what she did wrong.

46:51.442 --> 46:53.876
No, I suppose you're right,
but it's scary.

46:53.878 --> 46:55.878
What's that?

46:55.880 --> 46:58.281
That an emotion like love
can do so much damage.
