Professor Madeline Garber.

All of you deserve to be wiped

01:01.529 --> 01:03.062
We're just gonna let that go?

01:03.064 --> 01:04.696
The plan is,
we walk out of here.

01:04.698 --> 01:06.432
Screw the plan.

01:06.434 --> 01:07.833
No, no...

01:09.904 --> 01:11.003
What did you do?

01:14.041 --> 01:18.277
(Polaris laughing)

01:18.279 --> 01:19.945
-That tickles.
-Yeah.

01:19.947 --> 01:22.381
You know, they say that babies

01:22.383 --> 01:24.283

01:24.285 --> 01:25.784
Someone's been on the Internet.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.354

<i> Hola.</i>

01:29.356 --> 01:31.423
<i> Soy tu papa.</i>

01:32.426 --> 01:34.093
Nothing.

01:34.095 --> 01:36.428
See, the kid's not even
born yet,

01:36.430 --> 01:39.031
and you're already a better dad
than either of ours ever was.

01:39.033 --> 01:41.667
There's not much competition
on my end.

01:46.941 --> 01:49.908
You never talk about your dad.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.077
I mean, there's nothing
to talk about.

01:52.079 --> 01:54.480
He died in a plane crash
when I was one, and...

01:54.482 --> 01:57.683
You know who I mean.

02:00.087 --> 02:02.387
Lorna.

02:04.425 --> 02:06.291
(Polaris sighs)

02:06.293 --> 02:09.495
I don't want to talk about him.

02:11.966 --> 02:13.932
(Eclipse sighs)

02:13.934 --> 02:15.901
I'm sorry.

02:15.903 --> 02:20.005
Just promise me we'll never be
like our parents, okay?

02:20.007 --> 02:23.542
I promise.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.728
(tires squealing)

02:44.331 --> 02:46.532
-What the hell was that?
-What? We were just going to let

02:46.534 --> 02:48.033
a bunch of mutant-haters
walk away?

02:48.035 --> 02:49.334
Massacring 30 people

02:49.336 --> 02:51.470
-does not help our cause.
-I thought our cause

02:51.472 --> 02:53.205
was to build a place where
mutants could use their powers

02:53.207 --> 02:54.673
whenever they wanted to.

I got news for you,
you little psycho,

02:59.180 --> 03:00.345
you can't go around slaughtering

03:00.347 --> 03:01.480
everyone who pisses you off.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.215
If I killed everyone
who pissed me off,

03:03.217 --> 03:05.150
it'd be a lot more
than 30 people.

03:05.152 --> 03:06.552
ANDY:
Everybody just chill, okay?

03:06.554 --> 03:08.320
She made a mistake, all right?
She lost control.

03:08.322 --> 03:10.622
She doesn't belong here.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.201
Andy, she's right.

03:22.203 --> 03:24.036
I was just a tool
to them anyway.

03:28.042 --> 03:30.709
It's been awesome.

03:38.986 --> 03:41.453
What the hell?

03:42.389 --> 03:44.223
-We have to go get her.
-We can't.

03:44.225 --> 03:47.392
-She made her choice.
-(tires screeching)

03:50.864 --> 03:54.066
Lauren, we're almost there,

03:54.068 --> 03:56.835
We-we need to figure out
what we're doing.

03:56.837 --> 04:00.005
Dad, hey.

04:00.007 --> 04:02.307
-It's time to wake up.
-(gasps) Don't.

04:03.944 --> 04:07.012
(panting)

04:07.014 --> 04:09.414
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.850
Come on.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.891
-I think I should go
into this place alone.
-No.

04:19.893 --> 04:21.460
You're sick.
If anything happens,

04:21.462 --> 04:23.262
we can get you out of there.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.566

04:27.568 --> 04:30.769
You're hard to say no to,
you know that?

04:30.771 --> 04:34.706
Trust me,
I've known that since I was six.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.911

a hornet's nest right now.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.323
Well, if the world's
a tinderbox

04:51.325 --> 04:52.557
and the Inner Circle's
out there lighting matches,

04:52.559 --> 04:53.925
we have to do something.

04:53.927 --> 04:56.228
Just because we have no other
option doesn't mean

04:56.230 --> 04:58.230
that we need to go on some kind
of suicide mission.

04:58.232 --> 04:59.564
This isn't a suicide mission.

04:59.566 --> 05:00.832
Dude, for a guy with
the eyes of an eagle,

05:00.834 --> 05:02.067
you are stone-cold blind.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.769
There are three of us,

05:03.771 --> 05:06.271
-and they killed,
like, 20 people.
-37, actually.

05:06.273 --> 05:07.939
-37.
-I'm just talking about
finding out

05:07.941 --> 05:09.841
what they're doing.

05:09.843 --> 05:13.445
Okay? If we don't respond
to this, Clarice, we're done.

05:13.447 --> 05:15.814
The other Mutant Underground
stations,

05:15.816 --> 05:18.817
they're already losing faith;
you know it.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.653
Marcos, I need you to reach out
to the other stations

05:21.655 --> 05:23.422
and let them know
we are on this.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.190
All right, I'm going to get
out there before the trail

05:25.192 --> 05:27.492
-goes cold.
-(scoffs)

05:30.364 --> 05:32.264
Thought you said this was
a bad idea.

05:32.266 --> 05:34.933
Yeah, well, the only thing worse
than doing something stupid

05:34.935 --> 05:39.004
and dangerous is doing it alone.
Let's go.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.106
NEWS BROADCASTER:
...in Alexandria this afternoon,

05:41.108 --> 05:44.810
when anti-mutant protestors
attacked a foster care facility

05:44.812 --> 05:47.279
-for mutant children.
-(TV switches off)

05:50.684 --> 05:53.118
(indistinct chatter)

05:54.955 --> 05:57.723
REED (quietly):
Here goes nothing.

06:03.630 --> 06:08.533
Hi. I, um, need to talk
to Dr. Madeline Garber.

06:08.535 --> 06:11.370
The director.
And, uh, what is this regarding?

06:11.372 --> 06:14.306
-It's a private matter.
-Mm.

06:14.308 --> 06:15.907
Yeah, I'm going to need
a little bit more than that.

06:15.909 --> 06:18.009
It's complicated.
I just need to talk...

06:18.011 --> 06:19.578
Yeah, well, we get
a lot of folks in here

06:19.580 --> 06:21.246
that want to talk
to the director.

06:21.248 --> 06:24.082
I appreciate that, but we have
come a very long way.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.918
She used to work for my father,
and, um...

06:26.920 --> 06:28.854
I just need
to get her a message.

06:28.856 --> 06:31.790
Reed.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.559
(quietly):
God.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.397
-Are you Reed Strucker?
-Yes.

06:38.399 --> 06:41.333
I thought I'd never
see you again.

06:41.335 --> 06:42.968
What are you doing here?

06:45.205 --> 06:46.505
I need your help.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.619
REED:<i> Thank you so much</i>
<i> for meeting with us.</i>

07:00.621 --> 07:03.455
The work your father
and I did with you,

07:03.457 --> 07:05.390
that was the foundation
of my research, all of this.

07:05.392 --> 07:07.859
It started with you.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.462
I thought you might be able
to give us some advice.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.564
Well, honestly, I'm perplexed
as to what went wrong

07:12.566 --> 07:13.965
after all these years.

07:13.967 --> 07:17.002
But from what you say,
you need treatment, not advice.

07:18.906 --> 07:21.606
So you think you can do
something for Reed here?

07:21.608 --> 07:24.242
-Yes. I do.
-(sighs)

07:24.244 --> 07:26.945
But it will be easier for me
to explain in the lab.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.614
MADELINE: People talk about
the manifestations of X-Genes

07:29.616 --> 07:33.218
as "powers," but for many people
who have the X-Gene,

07:33.220 --> 07:34.820
they have serious problems

07:34.822 --> 07:38.089
that can better be described
as disabilities.

07:38.091 --> 07:39.991
Those are the people
we help here.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.927
REED: We tried lots of
different medications,

07:41.929 --> 07:43.595
and nothing worked.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.931
Well, I'm talking about
something that goes much deeper.

07:45.933 --> 07:49.801
We genetically tailor treatments
for each patient.

07:52.973 --> 07:56.575
Her body absorbs energy
and releases it uncontrollably.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.143
We're currently working
on a drug

07:58.145 --> 08:01.012
to help her metabolize
the energy.

08:01.014 --> 08:03.281
So then her powers will be gone?

08:03.283 --> 08:07.252
No, it's like giving
a diabetic insulin.

08:07.254 --> 08:10.255
In fact, the device we use is
much like an insulin pump.

08:10.257 --> 08:13.658
Her X-Gene will be active,
but she'll finally be able

08:13.660 --> 08:15.994
to be in control
of her own body.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.329
Hmm.

08:18.599 --> 08:21.132
LAUREN:
What about her?

08:21.134 --> 08:25.136
Shawna has Down syndrome
and an X-Gene.

08:25.138 --> 08:28.840
Her abilities promote
plant growth.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.877
Her parents wanted me
to "cure" her.

08:31.879 --> 08:33.712
But I told them
there's nothing to cure.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.046
And I gave her a job.

08:35.048 --> 08:38.683
Our plants have never
been happier.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.525
For some,
the X-Gene is a blessing.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.026
When it's a curse...

08:49.496 --> 08:50.962
...we find the answers.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.999
Uh, but Reed's treatments
already failed.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.967
But now we have Lauren.

08:55.969 --> 08:58.069
She's inherited his X-Gene.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.471
We'll stabilize Reed, and then

08:59.473 --> 09:02.507
use her genes
to figure out what went wrong.

09:02.509 --> 09:05.577
-If she's willing, of course.
-Yes, whatever it takes.

09:06.747 --> 09:09.080
Just want him to get better.

09:11.385 --> 09:12.984
SAGE:
It's getting tense out there.

09:12.986 --> 09:14.586
Since word broke out
about the bank,

09:14.588 --> 09:15.987
people have taken
to the streets.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.389
Mutants are getting attacked.

09:17.391 --> 09:19.424
Are Reeva and my sisters
gonna be okay out there?

09:19.426 --> 09:21.593
I don't know.

09:21.595 --> 09:24.095
But after what happened,
Reeva's not gonna give up

09:24.097 --> 09:25.764
until she finds Rebecca.

09:25.766 --> 09:28.333
If we don't find her,
she could ruin everything.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.668
ESME: Anything on the city
security cameras?

09:29.670 --> 09:32.504
Her powers make her really
difficult to find.

09:32.506 --> 09:34.339
I had a fix on her
a couple of times, but then she

09:34.341 --> 09:37.175
-twists something, and...
-I'm going to send Fade
and Bulk out, too.

09:37.177 --> 09:40.078
We need to wrap this up before
anyone else gets hurt.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.515
What happens when they find her?

09:46.787 --> 09:49.988
That's up to Reeva.

09:52.225 --> 09:54.259
(protestors clamoring)

09:54.261 --> 09:56.361
PROTESTOR: Yeah,
I'll be right there. Hey, hey!

09:56.363 --> 09:58.630
There's a group over by
the mutie rights center on 10th.

09:58.632 --> 10:01.366
-PROTESTOR 2:
Let's get down there.
-Let's go. Come on.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.134
Pretty sure the Inner Circle's
cars came this way

10:03.136 --> 10:04.703
after the bank.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.638
Well, thank God
you're pretty sure, otherwise

10:06.640 --> 10:07.973
we'll get our heads bashed in
for nothing.

10:07.975 --> 10:11.209
-(sighs)
-(car alarms wailing)

10:18.585 --> 10:19.117
What is it?

10:22.723 --> 10:25.123
Something strange happened here.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.591
Come on, John, let's face it.

10:26.593 --> 10:27.892
The Inner Circle's
long gone by now.

10:27.894 --> 10:30.195
No. Maybe not all of them.
Come on.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.842
Any progress?

10:43.844 --> 10:45.844
(sighs)
Not yet.

10:45.846 --> 10:48.647
We're working on it.
We'll get her back.

10:48.649 --> 10:49.748
Okay, that's what I'm
worried about.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.450
I cannot have Dawn here
if she's around.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.486
Look, I know things didn't go
as smoothly as we hoped...

10:54.488 --> 10:56.388
I've been in plane crashes
smoother than that.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.491
(scoffs)

10:59.493 --> 11:02.861
Are you seeing this?
It's anarchy out there.

11:02.863 --> 11:05.163
People are setting cars on fire,

11:05.165 --> 11:06.965
mutants are being attacked.

11:06.967 --> 11:10.101
The humans are being
a bit... reactive.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.436
What did you expect?

11:11.438 --> 11:13.538
That freak killed
a roomful of people

11:13.540 --> 11:14.773
before we could lift a finger.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.808
Lorna, believe me.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.677
We will keep Dawn safe here.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.612
Look at what is happening
out there.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.482
I know you care
about my daughter.

11:24.484 --> 11:28.053
Can you really look me in
the eyes and make that promise?

11:32.025 --> 11:34.092
That's what I thought.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.977
(exhales)

12:03.323 --> 12:06.991
(engine approaches)

12:11.398 --> 12:14.232
I've been looking for you
all over.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.134
Congratulations, you found me.

12:18.338 --> 12:19.738
Lorna.

12:19.740 --> 12:22.941
Lorna, Lorna. You can't do that.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.943
We've talked about this.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.778
-If people find out...
-Don't worry, Aunt Dane.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.113
Everyone already hates me.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.749
Come on. Nobody hates you.

12:30.751 --> 12:32.851
Those cupcakes you sent
to school for my birthday?

12:32.853 --> 12:35.353
Nobody even ate them.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.622
I'm already the bipolar girl

12:37.624 --> 12:39.624
with the green hair
and dead parents.

12:39.626 --> 12:41.526
So what if they know
I'm a mutant?

12:41.528 --> 12:44.295
Sweetheart.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.932
I know it's hard.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.968
It's for your safety.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.871
I've got groceries in the car.

12:52.873 --> 12:55.106
Let's go home.

12:57.210 --> 13:00.011
We can have
some melted birthday ice cream.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.006
¶ ¶

13:34.347 --> 13:35.847
What's wrong?

13:35.849 --> 13:38.316
Nothing.

13:43.924 --> 13:46.758
(door opens)

13:46.760 --> 13:48.827
(sighs)

14:04.044 --> 14:06.177
ECLIPSE:
Did you ever meet your real dad?

14:06.179 --> 14:08.479
My biological father.
I mean, I'm not even sure.

14:08.481 --> 14:09.747
Lorna.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.855
Sure, you want to see
my relationship

14:16.857 --> 14:18.723
with the guy they say is my dad?

14:18.725 --> 14:20.091
Yeah.

14:29.636 --> 14:33.504
One present on my 13th birthday.

14:33.506 --> 14:36.140
A, uh, red metal disk.

14:36.142 --> 14:40.311
Every little girl's dream.

14:40.313 --> 14:44.249
It's, uh, it's...
it's something.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.951
-Hey.
-No.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.756
It's nothing.

14:51.758 --> 14:54.926
It's worse than nothing.

14:54.928 --> 14:57.428
You know what it was like,

14:57.430 --> 15:03.001
growing up in that crappy little
town knowing he was out there?

15:03.003 --> 15:06.704
I remember watching the news.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.873
And they'd talk
about the Brotherhood,

15:08.875 --> 15:11.442
and how he was a monster.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.878
You know,
and all I could think was,

15:13.880 --> 15:17.882
"The world hates him,

15:17.884 --> 15:20.485
but I hate him more."

15:24.691 --> 15:25.957
(Dawn fusses)

15:25.959 --> 15:27.959
See that? It's all in the wrist.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.627
(elevator bell dings)

15:34.868 --> 15:37.368
Starting her training
a little early, aren't you?

15:37.370 --> 15:38.870
I'm not leaving her alone.

15:38.872 --> 15:40.405
Not with Little Miss Psycho

15:40.407 --> 15:43.441
and all those humans
with pitchforks out there.

15:45.312 --> 15:49.280
I think you're right,
about Dawn not being safe here.

15:50.884 --> 15:53.918
Oh, really?
What made you change your tune?

15:53.920 --> 15:55.987
You know the smoke
we saw outside?

15:55.989 --> 15:57.989
It was coming from

15:57.991 --> 16:00.992
a mutant foster care facility
in Georgetown.

16:00.994 --> 16:05.229
Humans, they, um...
set it on fire.

16:05.231 --> 16:07.799
(panting)

16:09.736 --> 16:11.602
The kids.

16:11.604 --> 16:15.573
They're still looking
for survivors.

16:22.515 --> 16:27.318
Look, Lorna, I... I may have
found a place for Dawn.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.320
A school for mutant children.

16:29.322 --> 16:32.123
It's safe, hidden,

16:32.125 --> 16:34.292
tucked away in the Swiss Alps.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.694
-Totally off the grid.
-I'm sorry, Switzerland?

16:36.696 --> 16:38.763
I wouldn't even
be able to see her.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.465
Until we have a mutant homeland,
there's nowhere close to here

16:40.467 --> 16:41.933
that she'll be safe.

16:41.935 --> 16:44.769
Look, Lorna,
I don't want this, either.

16:44.771 --> 16:49.107
I-I... I've become
very attached to Dawn.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.885
(chuckles softly)

17:03.156 --> 17:06.057
Please...

17:07.227 --> 17:12.196
...just think about it.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.906
(monitor beeping steadily)

17:21.908 --> 17:26.344
I was able to synthesize a new
batch of the original medication

17:26.346 --> 17:28.346
to stop the attacks
while we work on something

17:28.348 --> 17:30.948
more permanent.

17:32.919 --> 17:36.521
Is it gonna hurt like it did
when I was a kid?

17:36.523 --> 17:38.056
The burning?

17:38.058 --> 17:41.325
It shouldn't be as severe.

17:41.327 --> 17:43.361
But it won't be comfortable.

17:43.363 --> 17:45.863
You think it'll stop this?

17:45.865 --> 17:47.265
It should.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.734
Are you ready?

17:51.905 --> 17:53.604
(grunts, groans)

17:53.606 --> 17:55.573
-(inhales rapidly, shouts)
-Hey...

17:55.575 --> 17:59.510
Just breathe.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.946
(hyperventilating)

18:01.948 --> 18:04.082
Just breathe.

18:04.084 --> 18:06.951
(monitor beeping rapidly)

18:08.888 --> 18:11.456
(beeping slows)

18:11.458 --> 18:13.257
It's working.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.426
(panting)

18:23.236 --> 18:25.903
NOAH: Hey, I'm Noah.
Dr. M's medical assistant.

18:25.905 --> 18:28.139
I'm gonna be helping
with your genetic rundown.

18:28.141 --> 18:31.776
Which, unfortunately, means you
get to be a human pincushion.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.177
(chuckles)
Go for it.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.815
You think she'll be able
to help my dad?

18:37.817 --> 18:40.251
No question. She's the best.

18:40.253 --> 18:41.986
She saved my life.

18:41.988 --> 18:45.256
What do you mean?

18:45.258 --> 18:48.759
My X-Gene causes me
to make harmonic vibrations.

18:48.761 --> 18:50.094
They tear apart
anything around me.

18:50.096 --> 18:52.563
When I was a kid,
I nearly brought my house down.

18:52.565 --> 18:53.965
Almost killed my little brother.

18:53.967 --> 18:56.134
Dr. M hooked me up with this.

18:56.136 --> 18:58.970
Helps keep me under control.
I call it "Norm."

18:58.972 --> 19:01.272
(laughs)
You named it?

19:01.274 --> 19:03.107
Hey, little guy deserves a name.

19:03.109 --> 19:04.442
He gave me a normal life.

19:04.444 --> 19:06.811
"Normal life."

19:06.813 --> 19:08.746
You're okay with that?

19:08.748 --> 19:11.149
Hey, I went from worrying
about destroying my house

19:11.151 --> 19:13.017
to worrying about
my organic chem midterm.

19:13.019 --> 19:15.920
So, where do you go to school?

19:15.922 --> 19:21.526
Hmm. School kind of got
put on hold last year.

19:21.528 --> 19:24.662
Well, if you want, I can
show you around campus later

19:24.664 --> 19:27.265
while Dr. M works with your dad.
Hold that.

19:27.267 --> 19:29.967
I'd like that.

19:29.969 --> 19:31.302
Cool.

19:31.304 --> 19:33.371
-(chuckles)
-What color do you want?

19:33.373 --> 19:35.806
-Purple.
-Nice.

19:35.808 --> 19:38.042
(both laugh)

19:38.044 --> 19:40.044
(protestors shouting,
sirens wailing in distance)

19:40.046 --> 19:43.481
(glass shatters)

19:43.483 --> 19:45.950
So, any reason
why we're searching alleys

19:45.952 --> 19:47.518
for someone
from the Inner Circle?

19:47.520 --> 19:48.953
I mean, why would someone just

19:48.955 --> 19:50.988
randomly take off
in the middle of their getaway?

19:50.990 --> 19:53.958
I don't know.
This trail doesn't make sense.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.627
Whoa.

19:56.629 --> 19:58.796
What is it?

19:58.798 --> 20:00.965
I don't know.

20:06.139 --> 20:10.541
Whoa, the energy I use
to portal, it's, like, off.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.510
Like, twisted.

20:12.512 --> 20:14.312
John, I think something
happened here.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.746
Something bad.

20:24.924 --> 20:28.659
THUNDERBIRD:<i> That girl</i>
<i> from the psych ward, Rebecca.</i>

20:28.661 --> 20:31.862
<i> I think she used</i>
<i> her powers here.</i>

20:31.864 --> 20:33.598
Why here?

20:41.207 --> 20:42.873
Oh, my God.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.276
Oh, God.

20:50.550 --> 20:52.617
(indistinct conversations)

21:03.429 --> 21:06.530
Hey. You're Lorna, right?

21:06.532 --> 21:09.867
If I say no, will you go away?

21:09.869 --> 21:11.602
I heard of you.

21:11.604 --> 21:14.205
They say your dad's
that mutant from the news.

21:15.975 --> 21:18.209
Sorry, you've got
the wrong girl.

21:18.211 --> 21:20.144
But you got powers
like him, right?

21:20.146 --> 21:21.612
So what?

21:21.614 --> 21:23.581
So it's cool.

21:23.583 --> 21:27.285
Show me a trick.

21:27.287 --> 21:28.719
I'll buy you a drink.

21:28.721 --> 21:31.656
(laughs):
Well, how can I pass that up?

21:35.161 --> 21:37.228
Um...

21:42.769 --> 21:46.070
-Which one is your car?
-Right there.

21:46.072 --> 21:48.639
That one.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.241
(chuckles)

21:56.749 --> 21:58.082
(woman gasps)

21:58.084 --> 21:59.317
MAN:
Whoa, whoa, run, run!

22:10.997 --> 22:12.596
(car alarms wailing)

22:12.598 --> 22:14.765
My car...

22:16.102 --> 22:17.501
You crazy bitch!

22:18.471 --> 22:19.537
<i> (police siren chirps)</i>

22:22.342 --> 22:24.342
What is going on
with you, Lorna?

22:24.344 --> 22:27.845
This is the fourth time
you've been arrested this year.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.947
And it's not just the police,
you've stopped taking your meds,

22:29.949 --> 22:31.982
you're fighting
with the psychiatrists...

22:31.984 --> 22:33.851
Okay, maybe the creep
at the bar was right.

22:33.853 --> 22:36.053
I'm a crazy bitch.

22:36.055 --> 22:39.790
You have so much potential.

22:39.792 --> 22:41.625
Your parents would have
wanted...

22:41.627 --> 22:44.662
Yeah, let's talk
about my parents.

22:44.664 --> 22:46.530
How did I get out
of that cell tonight?

22:46.532 --> 22:48.999
I made a call.

22:49.001 --> 22:51.669
The police captain came to my
cell to apologize because he got

22:51.671 --> 22:54.505
a call from a substitute
teacher? Like...

22:54.507 --> 22:56.874
You have no idea how dangerous
these questions are.

22:56.876 --> 23:00.611
Come on, just tell me.
Who... who is my father?

23:06.185 --> 23:09.086
(sighs) My brother.

23:09.088 --> 23:12.056
A wonderful man who married
your mother and loved you

23:12.058 --> 23:13.991
until the day he died.

23:17.397 --> 23:18.929
Now get in the car.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.046
ECLIPSE:
<i> No, Brad, come on.</i>

23:36.048 --> 23:38.549
But we need Chicago's support.
We can't just give up on...

23:38.551 --> 23:41.685
-(knocking)
-Go away.

23:41.687 --> 23:44.422
No, not you. Listen.

23:44.424 --> 23:47.425
We're onto something.
We're onto something big.

23:47.427 --> 23:49.994
Now, if you guys can just
come out here, you can help...

23:53.399 --> 23:56.333
Brad, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

24:08.214 --> 24:11.515
Can we come in?

24:13.319 --> 24:15.052
ANCHOR:
<i> More trouble</i>

24:15.054 --> 24:18.122
as activists marched against
the mutant curfew tonight.

24:18.124 --> 24:20.391
Some politicians
have expressed sympathy

24:20.393 --> 24:23.594
with the protestors' goals,
but most have strongly condemned

24:23.596 --> 24:25.496
the acts of violence
and vandalism

24:25.498 --> 24:26.964
that have flared up in respon...

24:26.966 --> 24:29.433
(sighs)
Unbelievable.

24:29.435 --> 24:31.168
They oppress mutants for years

24:31.170 --> 24:34.004
and then act shocked when
they stand up for themselves.

24:34.006 --> 24:36.173
We don't really get involved.

24:36.175 --> 24:38.742
You don't need to worry.

24:38.744 --> 24:40.845
I know a little bit
about your situation.

24:40.847 --> 24:42.480
I know you've been running.

24:42.482 --> 24:45.082
I'm not concerned with politics.
I'm a doctor.

24:45.084 --> 24:46.350
I just want to help.

24:46.352 --> 24:47.852
Thank you, Madeline.

24:49.822 --> 24:52.957
I was so sorry to hear
about your father.

24:52.959 --> 24:55.159
He cared deeply
about these issues, you know.

24:55.161 --> 24:58.829
I thought he cared mostly about
not having a mutant for a son.

24:58.831 --> 25:01.799
You have no idea
how sad it makes me

25:01.801 --> 25:03.133
to hear you say that.

25:03.135 --> 25:04.802
REED:
He experimented on me.

25:04.804 --> 25:07.938
He never told me who I
really was, about my family.

25:07.940 --> 25:10.341
Reed, how could a father
tell his 12-year-old son

25:10.343 --> 25:11.942
that he had been brought up

25:11.944 --> 25:13.944
by two of the deadliest
terrorists in Europe?

25:13.946 --> 25:15.346
You have to understand,

25:15.348 --> 25:17.281
the X-Gene in your family
is highly unusual.

25:17.283 --> 25:19.383
The Fenris twins
had a connection

25:19.385 --> 25:21.385
we still don't understand.

25:21.387 --> 25:23.053
Their power fed off each other.

25:23.055 --> 25:25.155
It was said they even
shared their dreams.

25:25.157 --> 25:27.625
It was like they each had
half of the same mind.

25:27.627 --> 25:29.360
He was trying to protect you.

25:29.362 --> 25:31.829
Maybe he meant well.

25:31.831 --> 25:33.697
But I still think
I would've been better off

25:33.699 --> 25:35.032
knowing about my family.

25:46.012 --> 25:49.046
This belonged
to Andrea von Strucker.

25:56.022 --> 25:58.589
(music plays)

26:00.426 --> 26:02.326
Your father didn't want
to destroy the one thing

26:02.328 --> 26:04.028
that he got from his family,

26:04.030 --> 26:05.696
but he couldn't bear
to be near it

26:05.698 --> 26:09.600
because it reminded him of them,
so he gave it to me.

26:09.602 --> 26:11.135
I think you should have it.

26:14.407 --> 26:16.740
So beautiful.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.112
Your father loved you
very much, Reed.

26:22.114 --> 26:24.114
I hope--

26:24.116 --> 26:25.616
I believe--

26:25.618 --> 26:28.919
we can succeed

26:28.921 --> 26:31.589
where he failed.

26:31.591 --> 26:33.624
(music stops)

26:35.761 --> 26:38.796
Lorna, I won't let you do this.

26:38.798 --> 26:40.264
So, please, just-just
give her to me.

26:40.266 --> 26:41.599
I found a school.

26:41.601 --> 26:43.267
In Europe.
It's all been arranged.

26:43.269 --> 26:44.935
This is the safest place
for her.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.804
Look, I will keep her safe.
She's my daughter.

26:46.806 --> 26:48.238
-I'll do anything.
-How?

26:48.240 --> 26:49.940
How are you gonna
keep her safe, Marcos?

26:49.942 --> 26:52.076
I'll figure it out.
That's what parents do.

26:52.078 --> 26:53.711
-(Dawn fusses)
-They don't give up.

26:53.713 --> 26:55.245
-I'm not giving up.
-Oh, come on.

26:55.247 --> 26:56.814
I'm not giving up.

26:56.816 --> 26:58.749
I'm being realistic.

26:58.751 --> 27:00.217
I mean, what are you gonna do?

27:00.219 --> 27:02.052
You gonna shoot lasers
at the whole world?

27:02.054 --> 27:03.787
News flash:
it's already on fire.

27:03.789 --> 27:05.222
Yeah, because of you!

27:05.224 --> 27:07.024
(Dawn crying)

27:08.928 --> 27:11.462
You and Reeva

27:11.464 --> 27:12.997
and all of your new friends--

27:12.999 --> 27:15.966
you set the world on fire

27:15.968 --> 27:18.268
and now you're worried
that your daughter

27:18.270 --> 27:19.637
might get burned.

27:21.974 --> 27:24.475
Damn.

27:27.513 --> 27:30.447
You're a real piece of work,
you know that?

27:30.449 --> 27:32.983
Look, I didn't
come here to fight.

27:32.985 --> 27:35.319
I came here
to let you say goodbye.

27:36.622 --> 27:37.955
Lorna, you made me promise

27:37.957 --> 27:39.957
we wouldn't be like our fathers.

27:39.959 --> 27:41.859
Look what you're doing.

27:41.861 --> 27:43.994
You hated your dad for leaving.

27:43.996 --> 27:46.597
You know what that hurt did.

27:46.599 --> 27:50.000
Do you really want that
for Dawn, for our daughter?

27:50.002 --> 27:53.971
You don't get it, do you?

27:53.973 --> 27:56.974
I'd rather have her
grow up hating me

27:56.976 --> 27:59.843
than not grow up at all.

27:59.845 --> 28:02.012
(Polaris sniffles)

28:03.949 --> 28:07.284
Do you want to say goodbye
to your daughter or not?

28:07.286 --> 28:09.219
But I don't even know her.

28:11.457 --> 28:15.092
How am I supposed
to say goodbye?

28:25.871 --> 28:28.238
-ECLIPSE:
You think it's a boy or girl?
-Right now it's a walnut.

28:29.842 --> 28:31.475
I hope it's a girl.

28:31.477 --> 28:33.644
-You do?
-Yeah.

28:33.646 --> 28:35.379
I always figured
you'd want a boy.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.481
Someone to be all, like,

28:37.483 --> 28:40.918
-broody and macho.
-No.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.486
(chuckles)

28:42.488 --> 28:45.589
Um...

28:45.591 --> 28:47.658
No, when I, uh...

28:47.660 --> 28:49.059
when my father kicked me out

28:49.061 --> 28:51.361
and I was living
on the streets, I...

28:51.363 --> 28:53.564
I'd hang around
this church in town.

28:53.566 --> 28:56.500
One of the priests used to

28:56.502 --> 28:58.936
leave me leftover food
from the events.

28:58.938 --> 29:02.706
And I remember, one time,

29:02.708 --> 29:04.208
it was a...

29:04.210 --> 29:07.344
a first communion.

29:07.346 --> 29:11.215
I'm waiting across the street

29:11.217 --> 29:13.550
and I see this little girl,

29:13.552 --> 29:17.354
and she's seven years old.

29:17.356 --> 29:20.023
And she's dancing
with her father,

29:20.025 --> 29:23.127
and I remember

29:23.129 --> 29:27.097
the way that she was
looking at him,

29:27.099 --> 29:30.634
and I thought,

29:30.636 --> 29:33.070
"I want that someday."

29:33.072 --> 29:35.606
(man singing in Spanish)

29:49.555 --> 29:51.622
¶ ¶

30:07.072 --> 30:09.506
It's time.

30:15.514 --> 30:16.914
Who's gonna hold her

30:16.916 --> 30:18.982
and-and tell her she's special?

30:18.984 --> 30:21.885
Who's gonna love her, Lorna?

30:23.823 --> 30:26.890
Look, I'm sorry, Marcos,
we have to go.

30:30.663 --> 30:32.729
I love you, Dawn.

30:34.466 --> 30:36.934
<i> Te amo, mi Aurora.</i>

30:52.718 --> 30:56.119
Lorna, she deserves
to be with her family.

30:57.690 --> 31:00.290
You get that, right?

31:14.673 --> 31:16.740
(crying)

31:27.820 --> 31:29.887
(Eclipse yells, cries)

31:41.333 --> 31:43.333
¶ ¶

31:50.542 --> 31:52.910
Thank you, Shawna.

31:55.948 --> 31:58.715
So, Reed, how are you feeling
this morning?

31:58.717 --> 31:59.917
Better.

31:59.919 --> 32:01.251
Wonderful.

32:01.253 --> 32:03.020
And I have some good news

32:03.022 --> 32:05.055
about the work we're doing
with Lauren, as well.

32:05.057 --> 32:07.557
Really?
What did you find?

32:07.559 --> 32:09.359
Well, her X-Gene
is very similar to Reed's.

32:09.361 --> 32:11.228
By comparing the two,

32:11.230 --> 32:13.363
we should be able
to come up with a new version

32:13.365 --> 32:15.732
of the treatment
that will cause the attacks

32:15.734 --> 32:17.868
to stop permanently.

32:17.870 --> 32:20.070
But it'll be a long road.

32:20.072 --> 32:22.072
You'll have to stay here
under observation.

32:22.074 --> 32:24.274
The old serum
seems to be working.

32:24.276 --> 32:25.776
Can't we just use that?

32:25.778 --> 32:28.445
The original medication
was like a dam.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.647
But I suspect, with all
the stress you've been under

32:30.649 --> 32:32.616
this past year, it broke.

32:32.618 --> 32:34.418
We've patched up
the cracks for now,

32:34.420 --> 32:35.953
but eventually,

32:35.955 --> 32:38.555
the dam will break.
Again.

32:38.557 --> 32:41.325
-And then?
-If we don't treat him,

32:41.327 --> 32:43.393
Reed will die.

32:47.900 --> 32:49.967
(indistinct conversations)

32:51.470 --> 32:53.070
So, what do you think?

32:53.072 --> 32:55.339
-Does CSU make your list?
-It's pretty great.

32:55.341 --> 32:56.974
I just don't think
I could ever do this.

32:56.976 --> 32:58.508
Ah, don't say that.

32:58.510 --> 33:00.577
If I can have a normal life,
so can you.

33:00.579 --> 33:02.412
-It's not that simple.
-Look around.

33:02.414 --> 33:04.314
Right? You belong
at a place like this.

33:04.316 --> 33:06.583
-(laughs)
-Give you a backpack
and a few very heavy books

33:06.585 --> 33:08.752
-and you'll fit right in.
-That still doesn't
change the fact

33:08.754 --> 33:11.254
I'm here 'cause my dad's mutant
powers are out of control.

33:11.256 --> 33:13.190
You're more
than your X-Gene, Lauren.

33:13.192 --> 33:14.858
You know that, don't you?

33:16.462 --> 33:18.895
I just feel like it hangs
over everything I do.

33:20.299 --> 33:24.034
How do I just lay on the grass
reading a book?

33:24.036 --> 33:26.336
Play Frisbee with a friend?

33:27.506 --> 33:30.374
Easy. Yo.

33:30.376 --> 33:31.608
What are you doing?

33:34.646 --> 33:36.646
Now you've got a Frisbee
and a friend.

33:36.648 --> 33:37.948
Let's play.

33:37.950 --> 33:39.449
I cannot believe
you just did that.

33:40.853 --> 33:42.052
Ooh!

33:51.063 --> 33:52.629
You know, we've been at this
all night. The Inner Circle

33:52.631 --> 33:54.564
could be lurking
around any corner.

33:54.566 --> 33:56.466
I think it's time to call it.

34:00.372 --> 34:01.671
Oh, God, this is wrong.
She's here.

34:01.673 --> 34:05.909
Rebecca! Rebecca!

34:05.911 --> 34:09.179
-(grunts)
-Hey, Rebecca,
if that's you, look,

34:09.181 --> 34:11.148
-we're not here to hurt you.
-If you want your organs

34:11.150 --> 34:14.251
to stay inside your body,
you'll stop following me.

34:14.253 --> 34:15.919
Hey, hey.

34:15.921 --> 34:18.655
We just need information
on the Inner Circle. We know

34:18.657 --> 34:20.357
-you ran away
after the bank heist.
-Yeah, well, it turns out

34:20.359 --> 34:22.759
we have different views on
the whole mutant freedom thing.

34:22.761 --> 34:24.694
Okay.

34:24.696 --> 34:26.663
They're out there looking
for you right now. All right?

34:26.665 --> 34:29.099
Please, just tell us
what they're doing.

34:30.402 --> 34:33.503
Say I tell you.
Then what happens?

34:33.505 --> 34:35.372
We stop 'em.

34:35.374 --> 34:37.441
We're the only ones standing
between you and them right now.

34:37.443 --> 34:39.342
Just tell us what happened
at Creed Financial.

34:39.344 --> 34:40.544
Why they were there.

34:40.546 --> 34:42.946
I don't know much.

34:42.948 --> 34:44.247
We got inside the vault.

34:44.249 --> 34:45.282
They were looking
for information

34:45.284 --> 34:47.451
on something called Regimen.

34:47.453 --> 34:50.087
-Regimen-- what's that?
-I don't know.

34:50.089 --> 34:52.089
It's not like
they told me their plan.

34:52.091 --> 34:54.257
I was just a crowbar that they
used to get into the bank.

34:54.259 --> 34:56.460
My advice: give up now.

34:56.462 --> 34:59.362
-I should go.
-No, wait, wait.

34:59.364 --> 35:01.765
No, you guys have no idea
what you're up against.

35:11.477 --> 35:12.843
(knocking)

35:20.919 --> 35:22.953
Lorna?

35:22.955 --> 35:24.888
Hi.

35:24.890 --> 35:27.591
Oh, my God. Lorna.

35:27.593 --> 35:30.994
I'm sorry,
I don't understand, Lorna.

35:30.996 --> 35:34.431
You want me to take your baby?

35:34.433 --> 35:36.266
Not forever.

35:36.268 --> 35:39.603
We're building a place
for mutants. A place for her.

35:39.605 --> 35:42.672
But until then, it's just too
dangerous for her with me.

35:42.674 --> 35:45.041
I need her to be safe, I...

35:46.645 --> 35:49.813
I need her to be here.

35:49.815 --> 35:52.315
But you hated living here.

35:52.317 --> 35:53.517
No.

35:53.519 --> 35:54.985
I hated

35:54.987 --> 35:57.254
being a bipolar kid
with green hair,

35:57.256 --> 35:59.523
stuck in a town
that has three feed stores

35:59.525 --> 36:00.957
and no high-speed Internet.

36:00.959 --> 36:03.927
(chuckles softly)
Mm.

36:03.929 --> 36:06.763
I hated being... different.

36:12.671 --> 36:16.473
You know, I've never
even said this out loud, but...

36:16.475 --> 36:20.110
my entire life,
I thought that we lived

36:20.112 --> 36:22.279
in this Podunk little town

36:22.281 --> 36:25.148
because you were hiding
me from my birth father.

36:25.150 --> 36:27.851
-Lorna...
-No,

36:27.853 --> 36:30.887
it's okay, because...

36:30.889 --> 36:32.889
(sighs)

36:32.891 --> 36:34.791
...I get it now.

36:36.361 --> 36:38.295
You weren't hiding me from him.

36:39.364 --> 36:42.199
You were hiding me<i> for</i> him.

36:44.036 --> 36:46.102
He just wanted you to be safe.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.574
POLARIS:
That's the first time
you've ever admitted

36:50.576 --> 36:51.975
that he's my father.

36:51.977 --> 36:54.177
(sniffles)

36:54.179 --> 36:56.980
I hated him

36:56.982 --> 36:58.648
for not coming for me.

37:07.059 --> 37:09.092
I took that out on you.

37:10.762 --> 37:12.495
I'm sorry.

37:14.433 --> 37:16.566
And now I'm asking you

37:16.568 --> 37:19.603
to do the same thing
you did for him.

37:23.542 --> 37:26.376
Please...

37:26.378 --> 37:27.577
please take her.

37:27.579 --> 37:29.012
Please keep her safe.

37:29.014 --> 37:31.114
Of course I will, sweetheart.

37:32.284 --> 37:36.253
Thank you.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.627
Her father made her this.

37:43.629 --> 37:45.962
It always makes her smile.

37:48.233 --> 37:50.500
Yeah.

38:15.060 --> 38:17.527
Tell her that
I'll come back for her someday.

38:24.970 --> 38:27.037
And tell her she's special.

38:33.512 --> 38:35.578
Come on.

38:37.482 --> 38:40.150
How you feeling?

38:40.152 --> 38:41.818
BLINK:
Well, we were out all night.

38:41.820 --> 38:44.587
Excuse me for not having
superhuman energy reserves.

38:44.589 --> 38:46.323
(laughs)

38:46.325 --> 38:47.924
I've got some good news.
I've been looking into that name

38:47.926 --> 38:50.360
that Rebecca gave us: Regimen.

38:50.362 --> 38:53.930
It's a tech company.
Right here, offices in D.C.

38:53.932 --> 38:56.166
That's great, John.

38:56.168 --> 38:58.001
Yeah, it's progress.

38:58.003 --> 39:01.204
I... thought you'd be happy.

39:01.206 --> 39:04.207
Progress, huh? John, what
happened with that girl today--

39:04.209 --> 39:05.942
it scared me.

39:05.944 --> 39:07.977
You know, your whole...

39:07.979 --> 39:10.280
"never say die" attitude
is crap.

39:10.282 --> 39:13.216
It's admirable, but crap.

39:13.218 --> 39:15.552
You're picking a fight
we can't win

39:15.554 --> 39:18.355
because you think you can't die.

39:18.357 --> 39:20.623
I'm sorry,
but the last time I checked,

39:20.625 --> 39:23.159
you're freakishly strong,
but you are not immortal.

39:23.161 --> 39:24.361
I never said I was.

39:24.363 --> 39:26.863
Then stop acting like it.

39:39.911 --> 39:41.711
What are we gonna
do with him, Zing?

39:42.881 --> 39:45.014
What are we gonna do?

39:45.016 --> 39:48.518
Mm, so, bad news, Dr. M needs me
to draw some more blood.

39:48.520 --> 39:51.187
-You game?
-Yeah. Guess so.

39:51.189 --> 39:53.156
You know, it's really awesome
what you're doing here, right?

39:53.158 --> 39:56.493
Oh, I'm just doing what anyone
would for their family.

39:56.495 --> 39:58.928
Dr. M is on the verge of
something with you and your dad.

39:58.930 --> 40:00.263
What are you talking about?

40:00.265 --> 40:01.931
If her process works
with you two,

40:01.933 --> 40:03.767
it could be a solution
for all mutants.

40:03.769 --> 40:06.770
All mutants?

40:06.772 --> 40:09.572
Yes. It could make it possible
to permanently suppress

40:09.574 --> 40:12.575
the X-Gene in everyone.

40:12.577 --> 40:14.711
Why would she want to do that?

40:14.713 --> 40:16.045
Think about what it could mean.

40:16.047 --> 40:17.380
Anyone who doesn't want
the X-Gene,

40:17.382 --> 40:19.082
or doesn't want it
in their family,

40:19.084 --> 40:20.550
they'd have an answer.

40:20.552 --> 40:22.619
It could mean
an end to all the violence.

40:22.621 --> 40:24.954
How?

40:24.956 --> 40:26.956
Her brother was Matthew Risman.

40:26.958 --> 40:29.592
He, uh, founded the Purifiers.

40:31.630 --> 40:33.763
She hated him,

40:33.765 --> 40:36.433
hating the mutants for something
they couldn't change.

40:36.435 --> 40:38.935
But with the work we're doing,

40:38.937 --> 40:42.405
mutants can change.

40:42.407 --> 40:44.474
You're going to transform
the world, Lauren.
