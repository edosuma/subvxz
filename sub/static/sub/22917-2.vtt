03:42.848 --> 03:44.725
It's Hailey's conductor.
What an honor.

03:44.767 --> 03:46.685
-Hi.
-Hi.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.312
How come you're in our tree?

03:48.354 --> 03:50.022
It's pretty incredible,
this tree.

03:50.064 --> 03:52.358
So I just went up.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.652
Are you here to teach the
master class with Hailey, or...

03:54.693 --> 03:56.320
'Cause I'm sure
the school would be overjoyed.

03:56.362 --> 03:58.530
No, no, no. No,
she's the master this weekend.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.366
I'm just the boyfriend.

-Hi.
-Your hair!

-RODRIGO: I did it. I cut
the hair. -Oh, yeah. Hi, Mom.

04:08.207 --> 04:10.084
(laughs)

04:10.125 --> 04:11.418
-Hi. Hi, Dad.
-You're finally home.

04:11.460 --> 04:15.172
I hope you like it.
Yeah.

04:15.214 --> 04:16.632
Hey, can you do me a favor,

04:16.673 --> 04:18.257
uh, about my parents, please?

04:18.300 --> 04:20.260
I already love your parents.

04:20.302 --> 04:23.889
Uh, you won't. But that's
not what I'm worried about.

04:23.931 --> 04:27.810
Can you, um, not mention
the audition?

04:27.851 --> 04:29.436
Which audition?

04:29.478 --> 04:31.438
The one where I didn't
get into the orchestra.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.691
Also, can you not mention
that I'm conducting,

04:33.732 --> 04:35.818
and just say that I'm still
subbing with the orchestra

04:35.859 --> 04:37.444
and everything's on track.

04:37.486 --> 04:39.321
Oh, yeah, you should
do more subbing, you know?

04:39.363 --> 04:40.948
Because the orchestra
really misses you.

04:40.990 --> 04:44.284
Yeah, but that wouldn't
be good for me or for you.

04:44.326 --> 04:47.287
You know, we don't have to leave
each other's orbit, you know?

04:47.329 --> 04:49.164
We could orbit
each other's orbit.

04:49.206 --> 04:50.791
Mmm, someday, yes.

04:50.833 --> 04:54.086
But right now people see you
as, like, a star,

04:54.128 --> 04:56.672
and me as a piece
of space debris.

04:56.714 --> 04:59.049
That's what stars are made of.

-(oboe plays on tape) -KEITH:
It sometimes takes kids a bit

05:01.093 --> 05:03.095
to produce a constant tone,

05:03.137 --> 05:05.097
but she did it
in her first lesson.

05:05.139 --> 05:06.724
All-State is usually 12 and up.

05:06.765 --> 05:09.893
When she was ten
they requested that she join.

05:09.935 --> 05:12.396
When she was 11,
her, uh, teacher, Ms. Kolb,

05:12.438 --> 05:15.441
told me that she has what the
greats have-- she has a sound.

05:15.482 --> 05:16.942
Yes. Yes, you know,

05:16.984 --> 05:18.902
when I heard her play
for the first time,

05:18.944 --> 05:21.321
I felt birds in my stomach.

05:21.363 --> 05:22.781
Butterflies, you mean.

05:22.823 --> 05:26.368
-No, birds.
-Ah.

05:26.410 --> 05:28.287
I used to play a little, too.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.913
Oh, really?

05:29.955 --> 05:32.082
Well, we got to have
a father and daughter concerto.

05:32.124 --> 05:34.501
In college I realized
that there was engineering

05:34.543 --> 05:36.587
and there was music,
and I could not

05:36.628 --> 05:38.505
-be the best at both.
-(playing a soft melody)

05:38.547 --> 05:41.008
You do engineering?
What-what engineering do you do?

05:41.050 --> 05:43.052
My company sends satellites
into deep space,

05:43.093 --> 05:45.262
-monitor electronic signals
and waves. -Ah.

05:45.304 --> 05:49.016
Wow. So is it true that
dark matter is superfluid--

05:49.058 --> 05:51.852
-that it changes form all
the time? -That would explain

05:51.894 --> 05:55.022
how galaxies keep
from spinning apart.

05:55.064 --> 05:57.191
-Oh.
-Hey.

05:57.232 --> 05:59.318
-Are you ready
for that class tomorrow? -Yup.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.820
-Me, too.
-Hey.

06:01.862 --> 06:05.783
-He gets to come, but I don't?
-Yup. -(playing stops)

06:05.824 --> 06:08.869
(clears throat)
So, um...

06:08.911 --> 06:10.662
how long have you two
been together?

06:10.704 --> 06:12.456
-Like a few months.
-A few years.

06:12.498 --> 06:15.793
(short chuckle) So, uh, Rodrigo,
where in New York do you live?

06:15.834 --> 06:17.086
I live in Hai Lai.

06:17.127 --> 06:18.295
-Huh?
-No.

06:18.337 --> 06:19.630
He doesn't live in me.

06:19.671 --> 06:21.757
He has his own apartment

06:21.799 --> 06:24.468
that's, like, a place where
he keeps all his stuff, but then

06:24.510 --> 06:26.804
-sometimes he'll just stay
with me. -I don't have a place.

06:26.845 --> 06:28.388
-Neither I have stuff.
-We're not together

06:28.430 --> 06:31.100
-in, like, a normal way.
-What does that mean?

06:31.141 --> 06:32.935
-Yeah. -Well, we're not together
like you guys are.

06:32.976 --> 06:36.146
Actually, despite being
unspeakably normal...

06:36.188 --> 06:38.357
-(chuckles)
-we do have a little news.

06:38.398 --> 06:41.693
Yes. We are going to
renew our vows on Sunday.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.821
-30 years. (chuckles)
-Great!

06:43.862 --> 06:45.614
Oh, that's excellent,
congratulations.

06:45.656 --> 06:47.783
-Really?
-It's a small ceremony,

06:47.825 --> 06:50.702
-down by the dock.
-(Rodrigo chuckles)

06:50.744 --> 06:52.704
I was hoping
you could play something.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.124
Uh... I-I would love to do that,

06:55.165 --> 06:58.210
but I have to get home...
that day.

06:58.252 --> 07:00.170
You can stay
a couple extra hours.

07:00.212 --> 07:02.464
RODRIGO:
Yeah. Come on, let's stay.

07:02.506 --> 07:04.466
-Uh, no. -Yeah,
we get the next bus, yeah.

07:04.508 --> 07:07.344
I-I... No, because I have this
rehearsal that I have to do,

07:07.386 --> 07:09.221
and it just wouldn't
really work out.

07:09.263 --> 07:11.807
I can't.
Sorry.

07:12.850 --> 07:14.017
How is your practice?

07:14.059 --> 07:15.185
It's good.

07:15.227 --> 07:16.854
Are you subbing in a lot?

07:16.895 --> 07:18.397
Yeah, she's subbing
all the time.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.566
Whenever we need a sub,
she comes in for the oboe,

07:20.607 --> 07:22.609
of course. She's like
a family for the orchestra.

07:22.651 --> 07:24.361
Well, that sounds
like an endorsement.

07:24.403 --> 07:26.488
So, are there any slots
opening up soon?

07:26.530 --> 07:30.200
-Uh, it's...
not that predictable. -Yeah.

07:30.242 --> 07:31.368
No, they have to die.

07:31.410 --> 07:32.911
But you think she has a shot?

07:32.953 --> 07:34.788
She has a shot,
a very good shot.

07:34.830 --> 07:36.707
If she wants that,
yeah, she can, yeah.

07:36.748 --> 07:38.792
It would be great, you know,
because, you know,

07:38.834 --> 07:40.669
the orchestra would love
to have her back

07:40.711 --> 07:42.421
-as-as a... as-as more...
-Thank you so much.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.839
-More.
-Well, good.

07:43.881 --> 07:45.257
-Yeah.
-Cheers. -Oh.

07:45.299 --> 07:47.509
-(laughing)
-Ah.

07:47.551 --> 07:49.428
It means a lot to us
to hear you say that.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.514
-Yeah?
-Thank you. Cheers. Cheers.

07:52.556 --> 07:55.809
You know,
now I know where the,

07:55.851 --> 07:58.520
"You're the best or you
fucking suck" thing comes from.

07:58.562 --> 08:02.024
(Hailey inhales
and exhales deeply)

08:02.065 --> 08:04.484
Are you sure you don't want
to go to the ceremony?

08:04.526 --> 08:06.028
-(strange moaning)
-Yeah.

08:06.069 --> 08:09.072
I don't want to support
their weird relationship.

08:09.114 --> 08:10.991
He's not nice to her.

08:11.033 --> 08:12.910
It's uncomfortable.

08:12.951 --> 08:15.370
(strange moaning)

08:18.498 --> 08:21.001
Is that an animal?

08:21.043 --> 08:24.171
Yeah.

08:24.213 --> 08:26.632
It's an animal that is very sad
and lonely.

08:26.673 --> 08:29.301
(rhythmic thumping,
man and woman moaning)

08:29.343 --> 08:32.095
Oh, my God.
Okay, come on.

08:32.136 --> 08:34.472
-Come on, let's go right now.
-(moaning and thumping continue)

08:34.514 --> 08:37.433
-Come on, come on.
-Is that your mom?

08:37.476 --> 08:39.269
-(door creaks open)
-(crickets chirping)

08:39.311 --> 08:41.104
(whispering):
Is it over?

08:41.145 --> 08:43.315
(loud thumping)

08:43.357 --> 08:46.068
No, they're still going
really hard at it.

08:46.109 --> 08:48.695
Ew. (laughs)

08:51.323 --> 08:53.700
Yeah, I think they're living
their second spring.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.827
-Or their first one.
-No, their second.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.914
-(boat horn blows) -Yeah.
It's what they call it in Japan,

08:58.956 --> 09:00.832
you know,
when you're a bit older

09:00.874 --> 09:03.502
and you feel foolish
and childish again.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.921
They call it the second spring.

09:05.963 --> 09:08.382
(crickets chirping)

09:08.423 --> 09:10.801
(whispering):
Listen to the quiet.

09:12.886 --> 09:16.431
You know, it'd be really funny
if you and I end up living here.

09:16.473 --> 09:19.017
Right? With kids.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.311
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

09:21.353 --> 09:23.563
No, just imagine.
I mean, just, uh, no?

09:23.605 --> 09:25.315
I mean, anything can happen.

09:25.357 --> 09:29.194
Yeah, but I just don't think
that's gonna happen.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.029
Besides, in two months,

09:31.071 --> 09:33.282
you're gonna meet
some super famous opera singer

09:33.323 --> 09:35.951
or some, like, bipolar painter.

09:35.993 --> 09:37.577
And then a year from now,

09:37.619 --> 09:39.663
we'll end up making out
in a closet somewhere,

09:39.705 --> 09:43.417
and that will be that,
'cause that's just what we do.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.839
I'm not like that right now.

09:50.549 --> 09:53.552
Yeah, right now, but
you're not like a normal person.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.971
You're like a...

09:56.013 --> 10:00.100
musical, magical... elf.

10:01.310 --> 10:04.062
If I was an elf,
I would tell you.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.564
Are you sure?

10:05.605 --> 10:07.899
I'm a person, Hai Lai.
I'm a human.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.818
-I know you're a person.
-Yeah?

10:09.860 --> 10:11.320
You're the best person.

10:11.361 --> 10:14.114
I'm glad you're here.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.119
(laughing)

10:19.161 --> 10:21.455
Yeah. Me, too.

10:21.496 --> 10:24.249
Elf.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.585
(Hailey giggles,
Rodrigo laughs)

10:26.626 --> 10:29.296
GLORIA:
Yes! Yes! Yes!

10:29.338 --> 10:31.381
Yes! Yes!

10:31.423 --> 10:34.718
Oh. Well, who's giving you
such a great time?

10:34.760 --> 10:38.388
The Pope! We got the Pope!

10:38.430 --> 10:40.057
(Gloria yells)

10:40.098 --> 10:42.351
He'll bring all
of his followers.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.519
Catholics?

10:44.561 --> 10:47.189
Instagram.

10:47.230 --> 10:50.484
He wants to hear
Verdi's Force of Destiny.

10:50.525 --> 10:52.819
Couldn't I step in
for that piece?

10:52.861 --> 10:54.488
Oh, my God. Rodrigo?

10:54.529 --> 10:56.198
He'll send the poor man
to sleep!

10:56.239 --> 10:58.533
Well, The New York Times

Maybe I should go.

21:03.388 --> 21:04.681
Sit.

21:04.722 --> 21:07.684
I know someone.

21:07.725 --> 21:09.435
Yeah, five, five.

21:09.477 --> 21:11.187
Five times I've been married...

21:11.229 --> 21:12.730
to the same person.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.233
-No.
-Yeah. No kids, no pets.

21:15.274 --> 21:18.277
It was, you know,
just faithful stuff. Yeah.

21:18.319 --> 21:19.946
-(Amy laughs)
-Yeah.

21:19.988 --> 21:21.781
And she's a nun now.

21:21.823 --> 21:23.199
-A nun? (laughs)
-Yeah.

21:23.241 --> 21:24.617
Oh, my word.
(chuckles)

21:24.659 --> 21:28.413
Your life's like
a nonfiction novel.

21:28.454 --> 21:32.583
I will play for the ceremony
if you want me to, Dad.

21:36.004 --> 21:38.172
So you're not practicing?

21:39.549 --> 21:42.176
Uh, no. I am practicing,
just not as much.

21:42.218 --> 21:44.303
What does that mean,
"not as much"?

21:44.345 --> 21:46.639
It just means that I'm also
practicing something else.

21:46.681 --> 21:48.141
How much does she practice?

21:48.182 --> 21:49.308
Talk to me, Dad.

21:49.350 --> 21:52.228
You always do this.

21:52.270 --> 21:54.105
You get right up

21:54.147 --> 21:57.817
to the finish line,
and then you fall apart.

21:57.859 --> 22:00.236
-I don't fall apart.
-When she was 13,

22:00.278 --> 22:03.197
she entered all these
competitions, bigger and bigger,

22:03.239 --> 22:05.867
and then she just ran
off the stage and didn't play

22:05.908 --> 22:07.368
-for another six months.
-I needed to find a reason

22:07.410 --> 22:08.536
to play that wasn't about you.

22:08.578 --> 22:09.871
-Dad.
-Let's just all take a breath...

22:09.912 --> 22:11.205
Hey, I'm talking right now.

22:11.247 --> 22:12.874
It is a little bit about us,
Hailey,

22:12.915 --> 22:15.710
because we sold the van
so you could have the oboe.

22:15.752 --> 22:18.713
-(sighs) -We moved here, so we
could be close to the school.

22:18.755 --> 22:21.007
-I didn't ask you to do that.
-KEITH: You didn't have to

22:21.049 --> 22:23.468
because we wanted to provide
whatever was necessary

22:23.509 --> 22:24.510
to realize your potential.

22:24.552 --> 22:26.095
Now, you're right on the cusp

22:26.137 --> 22:29.557
of getting into one of the best
orchestras in the world,

22:29.599 --> 22:31.642
and you can't follow through.

22:40.651 --> 22:43.279
I auditioned
for the symphony, Dad.

22:43.321 --> 22:45.198
A spot opened up.

22:45.239 --> 22:47.116
I tried out.

22:47.158 --> 22:48.576
I didn't get in.

22:48.618 --> 22:50.828
(chair scrapes)

22:50.870 --> 22:52.080

22:52.121 --> 22:54.457

RODRIGO:
Are you feeling better, Hai Lai?

23:00.713 --> 23:02.590
I'm feeling drunker.

23:02.632 --> 23:05.843
You know, I'm a big fan, the way
you make your reeds, you know?

23:05.885 --> 23:08.179
-It's perfect. -Yeah, well,
they have to be perfect.

23:08.221 --> 23:09.847
Because if they're not perfect,
then you blow

23:09.889 --> 23:11.432
the entire performance,
like I did

23:11.474 --> 23:14.018
with you the first time
I ever played for you.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.104
Don't you think
I threw you in too fast?

23:16.145 --> 23:17.855
-(blows note)
-No, you didn't.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.273
Will you sit with me?

23:19.315 --> 23:20.817
Mm-hmm.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.571
You know, when I was a kid,

23:25.613 --> 23:28.407
he'd stand outside my door
and listen

23:28.449 --> 23:30.076
so that I wouldn't stop
practicing

23:30.118 --> 23:31.994
until the fifth hour was up.

23:32.036 --> 23:34.247
The thing is
that I still love it so much.

23:34.288 --> 23:35.498
Mm.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.500
I love the music so much.

23:37.542 --> 23:39.168
I just choke.

He's right.

23:40.461 --> 23:42.046

23:42.088 --> 23:45.299
I understand the choking thing.

23:45.341 --> 23:48.511
-I feel like I'm choking also.
-You never choke.

23:48.553 --> 23:50.596
No, no, really,
I've been choking recently.

23:50.638 --> 23:53.599
I don't know why
I feel that, but...

23:53.641 --> 23:56.144
Asphyxiating, you know?

23:56.185 --> 23:57.812
Like I want to run away
or something.

23:57.854 --> 23:59.730
I mean, it's too much.
I-I don't know.

23:59.772 --> 24:02.900
-Is it really boring, being here
with my parents? -Oh, no, no.

24:02.942 --> 24:05.570
Nothing to do with your parents.
No. No, on the contrary.

24:05.611 --> 24:07.655
No, it's quite fascinating
to be with them.

24:07.697 --> 24:10.324
Your father, your mother,
the way that they...

24:10.366 --> 24:13.744
You know? And the dinner table,
they-they say these things

24:13.786 --> 24:17.081
that are... nice,
but a bit poisonous.

24:17.123 --> 24:18.791
They lift you and they trap you.

24:18.833 --> 24:21.002
(chuckles)
Yeah. They trap you.

24:21.043 --> 24:22.712
I have other traps.

24:22.753 --> 24:24.547
Many, actually.

24:24.589 --> 24:27.216
But I-I don't have that one.

24:27.258 --> 24:30.219
I'm curious to see when you--

24:30.261 --> 24:33.389
I don't know--
when you break away from it,

24:33.431 --> 24:35.391
what's underneath.

24:35.433 --> 24:36.976
Human.

24:37.018 --> 24:39.228

Wow.

25:32.365 --> 25:35.493

I didn't get into the orchestra

25:35.534 --> 25:38.162
is because I have to try this.

have to become the boss?

a great instrumentalist?

25:47.505 --> 25:50.132

that the difference

25:50.174 --> 25:51.968
between the best
and the second best

25:52.009 --> 25:54.011
is how bad you want it.

that I could kill myself for.

in a straight line.
