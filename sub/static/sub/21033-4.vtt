Just pick a spot
and go potty, Grant.

You're stressed.
Is Perry picking on you again?

00:19.624 --> 00:21.582
Hey, big guy, what's the rush?

What did these poor ants

Out of my way.

SCOTT:<i> Okay, guys,</i>
<i>get ready, that's it.</i>

00:51.416 --> 00:53.915
(ANTS CHIRPING)

00:53.915 --> 00:56.957
My mustache will be back,
but you won't.

00:59.790 --> 01:00.874
(MUFFLED EXPLOSION)
(COUGHING)

01:01.790 --> 01:02.790
(COUGHING)

01:04.874 --> 01:05.874
Huh?

01:06.541 --> 01:08.041
Okay.

01:08.041 --> 01:09.666
All right.

01:09.666 --> 01:11.041
I've had enough of you!

01:12.166 --> 01:13.790
Say goodbye, ants.

Oh, yeah.
Great job, James.

01:25.166 --> 01:26.374
Awesome, little Hank.

01:26.374 --> 01:27.582
Good job, Ben.
