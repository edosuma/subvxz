WEBVTT

00:01.300 --> 00:03.101
Oh, nice hit!

00:04.737 --> 00:09.273
Yes. Oh, yeah, that'll
be fine. Ok, bye-bye.

00:11.577 --> 00:13.645
Tim, you know
what my problem is?

00:17.850 --> 00:20.218
<i>(louder)</i> tim! You know
what my problem is?

00:20.219 --> 00:22.520
Huh?
You know
what my problem is?

00:22.521 --> 00:24.555
You repeat yourself.

00:25.958 --> 00:28.026
No. I am just too nice.

00:28.027 --> 00:30.061
That's what I was gonna say.
Can I watch this fight,
please?

00:30.062 --> 00:31.997
No. Here. Wait.

00:31.998 --> 00:33.665
<i>(turns sound down)</i>

00:33.666 --> 00:36.234
Why are you turning
the sound down?
I need your help. Here...

00:36.235 --> 00:38.536
What's the point of
listening to the fight

00:38.537 --> 00:40.538
If I can't hear their skulls
being batted around?

00:40.539 --> 00:42.573
You know that woman -
marilyn sanders -

00:42.574 --> 00:44.643
Who's always raising money
for everything?

00:44.644 --> 00:47.112
Cute blonde with
the really big... Eyes?

00:49.548 --> 00:54.552
Those "eyes" are way bigger
than they were six months ago.

00:54.553 --> 00:58.523
Anyway, she talked me
into heading up
this library fund-raiser.

00:58.524 --> 01:00.525
I don't have time for this.

01:00.526 --> 01:04.729
I got the job and the boys
and... My inattentive husband.

01:04.730 --> 01:05.830
Huh?

01:05.831 --> 01:08.566
Tim, come on.

01:08.567 --> 01:10.735
Tell you what you do.
What?

01:10.736 --> 01:12.737
You call her up
and you lie to her,

01:12.738 --> 01:16.407
Tell her you gotta
spend all this time
with your husband

01:16.408 --> 01:18.843
'cause he's got
a severe mental problem.

01:21.280 --> 01:23.181
Where's the lie?

02:33.452 --> 02:36.087
What do you think, could we
put the kids in the middle?

02:44.230 --> 02:46.231
Al has just
cleaned this window

02:46.232 --> 02:48.233
With binford's
standard-size squeegee,

02:48.234 --> 02:50.301
Perfect for daily jobs.

02:50.302 --> 02:53.571
For the big job, you might
want to turn to binford's
mega squeegee.

02:56.308 --> 02:59.377
This can clean the windshield
of a big rig in one stroke.

02:59.378 --> 03:02.346
And a storefront
in under a minute.

03:02.347 --> 03:05.150
And al's mother's back
in less than an hour.

03:09.755 --> 03:11.790
Now remember, if it doesn't
say "binford" on it,

03:11.791 --> 03:14.025
Somebody else
probably makes it.

03:14.026 --> 03:16.360
<i>(musical flourish)</i>

03:19.198 --> 03:22.000
That brings us
to the final segment
here on <i>tool time.</i>

03:22.001 --> 03:24.402
When men get done doing
a real hard job,

03:24.403 --> 03:28.072
Sometimes we don't look like
we want to, right, al?
No, we don't.

03:28.073 --> 03:30.241
I'm usually hot,
greasy, sweaty...

03:30.242 --> 03:31.843
And bleeding.

03:35.414 --> 03:37.081
But help is on the way.

03:37.082 --> 03:40.584
To give us some grooming tips
from the job site,

03:40.585 --> 03:43.021
We've invited those boys from
bay city, michigan, back -

03:43.022 --> 03:45.023
The guys from
k&b construction company.

03:45.024 --> 03:47.091
Let's give 'em
a big <i>tool time</i> welcome.
Come on, everybody.

03:47.092 --> 03:49.260
Timmy!

03:52.031 --> 03:55.133
You all remember
pete and dwayne.
You got a new member - gus.

03:55.134 --> 03:57.202
Gus, what'd you do before you
joined up with k&b?

03:57.203 --> 04:00.305
Tim, I spent nine years
teaching 12th-grade math.

04:00.306 --> 04:04.809
Dwayne spent nine years
taking 12th-grade math.

04:04.810 --> 04:07.045
Could we? Great.

04:07.046 --> 04:09.113
What kind of grooming tips
you got for us?

04:09.114 --> 04:12.817
Well, tim, probably
the biggest concern
in construction today

04:12.818 --> 04:17.620
Is when you've got to
go somewhere really fancy
straight from the job site.

04:17.622 --> 04:19.790
That's right, buddy.
You can't show up
looking like this

04:19.791 --> 04:23.194
To vegas night
at the kiwanis.

04:23.195 --> 04:25.363
So...
What's a guy to do?

04:25.364 --> 04:29.433
Well, tim, we like to use
the tools of our trade
to clean up our act.

04:29.434 --> 04:31.669
Let me show you.

04:31.670 --> 04:35.240
Tim, I want you
to take a look at my boot
and tell me what you see.

04:35.241 --> 04:38.276
All right. Marv, move in
and let's take a look at this.

04:38.277 --> 04:39.978
Oh. Good golly, molly.

04:39.979 --> 04:44.883
I see a little bit
of concrete shavings,
maybe some tar...

04:44.884 --> 04:47.752
Something maybe you
should have wiped off
before you came in.

04:47.753 --> 04:49.888
It's not gonna
look like that for long,

04:49.889 --> 04:52.490
'cause all I have to do
is take an ordinary sock,

04:52.491 --> 04:55.059
Roll it around
my screwdriver like this,

04:55.060 --> 04:58.930
Stick the screwdriver
in my drill...
All right.

04:58.931 --> 05:02.200
And voilÃ , I've got myself
a nifty boot buffer.

05:02.201 --> 05:05.069
<i>(whirring)</i>

05:05.070 --> 05:06.237
Hey, hey!

05:08.707 --> 05:11.009
Now there's a tip
we can all use.

05:11.010 --> 05:13.411
I've always said
you can tell a man
by the shine of his shoes.

05:13.412 --> 05:15.579
And by how clean
his nails are.

05:15.580 --> 05:18.316
You need a little work
on those nails.

05:18.317 --> 05:21.019
That's why we've got this line
of binford hand-care products
in attractive packaging.

05:21.020 --> 05:22.387
Environmentally sound.

05:22.388 --> 05:24.389
I know they're
dirty now, tim,

05:24.390 --> 05:27.691
But sometimes on the job site,
when you ain't got no water,

05:27.692 --> 05:29.760
You can't
get your nails clean.

05:29.761 --> 05:32.530
So before I step out
to the discos,

05:32.531 --> 05:34.532
I take a ten-penny nail,

05:34.533 --> 05:38.102
And I scrunch out
all that filth and crud.

05:38.103 --> 05:40.138
Marv, you wanna come
in for a closeup?

05:40.139 --> 05:43.308
No, let's not do that now.
Out of respect for people
who might be having a meal,

05:43.309 --> 05:45.709
We'll forgo that demonstration,
but thanks so much
for showing us that.

05:45.710 --> 05:48.012
Ok, ok.
Anything else
you guys got for us?

05:48.013 --> 05:50.415
Well, tim, probably
the biggest grooming problem

05:50.416 --> 05:55.686
Out on
the construction site
is... Well, helmet hair.

05:55.687 --> 05:57.788
Oh, yeah, hat head.

06:01.626 --> 06:03.962
Not a real big problem
on your end, is it?

06:03.963 --> 06:06.931
Why don't I just buff that up
to a high gloss?

06:09.734 --> 06:15.139
Tim, I've found that a good,
strong air compressor...

06:15.140 --> 06:20.011
Works beautifully to add bounce
to a lifeless hairdo.

06:20.012 --> 06:23.081
You wanna give it a shot?

06:23.082 --> 06:24.748
Right here.
All right.

06:30.755 --> 06:33.557
Ok, that's better.

06:33.558 --> 06:35.393
That's all the time we have.

06:35.394 --> 06:37.395
Next time we get
to more grooming tips,
the guys can come back.

06:37.396 --> 06:39.263
Al, why don't you tell us
what's on the next show?

06:39.264 --> 06:40.999
Next week, we'll
be doing our salute
to electrical...

06:41.000 --> 06:42.700
<i>(air hisses)</i>
...Wiring!

06:44.803 --> 06:46.804
That's all the time we have.
Thanks for joining us
on <i>tool time.</i>

06:46.805 --> 06:49.273
I'm tim taylor.
See you next time.

06:56.115 --> 06:58.016
Al.
Hi.

06:58.017 --> 07:00.985
Did you hear what happened?
What's that?

07:00.986 --> 07:02.887
Mr. Binford died.

07:04.423 --> 07:05.723
Mr. Binford?

07:05.724 --> 07:08.659
Yeah, he had a heart attack
this morning.

07:08.660 --> 07:11.695
Oh... I can't
believe that.

07:11.696 --> 07:14.832
Does tim know?
I don't think so.

07:14.833 --> 07:16.834
Oh, boy, he's gonna
be devastated.

07:16.835 --> 07:19.037
Mr. Binford was like
a father to him.

07:19.038 --> 07:21.805
And don't do that again.

07:21.806 --> 07:24.142
Oh, that was a fun show.
Thanks, guys. A lot of fun.

07:24.143 --> 07:26.944
Brace yourself, tim.
Something awful has happened.

07:26.945 --> 07:28.946
You saw your mom
in the shower?

07:33.652 --> 07:34.985
Mr. Binford died.

07:41.360 --> 07:43.627
How can you play darts
at a time like this?

07:43.628 --> 07:46.164
Because the foosball table's
broken.

07:46.165 --> 07:50.000
Mr. Binford passed away.
Don't you think
we should talk about this?

07:50.001 --> 07:51.835
He's dead.
Now get outta my way.

07:51.836 --> 07:53.938
I think you need
to grieve.

07:53.939 --> 07:56.340
I think you need
to get outta my way.

07:56.341 --> 07:58.776
If you don't
wanna talk about it,
I certainly do.

07:58.777 --> 08:00.278
Oh, come on.

08:00.279 --> 08:03.047
Mr. Binford's death
was very traumatic for me.

08:03.048 --> 08:06.817
There was... There was something
left unresolved between us.

08:06.818 --> 08:08.852
Between you and john?
Yes.

08:12.657 --> 08:15.460
Last week, I asked
if we could have
a hot-water spigot

08:15.461 --> 08:16.927
On the water cooler.

08:16.928 --> 08:19.097
He said he didn't think
it was necessary.

08:19.098 --> 08:23.000
So the next morning,
I was very curt to him
when I said hello.

08:25.670 --> 08:26.737
Yeah?

08:26.738 --> 08:28.706
Well, that's it.

08:28.707 --> 08:31.175
Now I have to live with that
for the whole rest of my life.

08:31.176 --> 08:34.378
Boy, that's
a terrible burden, al.

08:34.379 --> 08:36.414
I know.
It's probably nothing

08:36.414 --> 08:38.549
Compared to what you
must be going through.

08:38.549 --> 08:42.120
I'm not going through anything.

08:42.121 --> 08:44.788
When was the last time
you spoke with him?
Yesterday.

08:44.789 --> 08:46.857
You did? How'd he sound?

08:46.858 --> 08:49.427
Alive!

08:49.428 --> 08:52.130
Did he say anything
about my being curt to him?

08:52.131 --> 08:54.532
Did he say...?

08:54.533 --> 08:59.870
As a matter of fact, that's...
That's all we talked about.

08:59.871 --> 09:02.940
I'm convinced that
that's what killed him, al.

09:07.212 --> 09:09.480
Al, it was a joke.
Ooh-ooh.

09:09.481 --> 09:12.250
Al, come on!

09:12.251 --> 09:17.054
Sorry, tim,
but I... I don't have
my usual sense of humor.

09:17.055 --> 09:19.790
And frankly, I find
your attempt at levity
a little inappropriate.

09:19.791 --> 09:21.792
What am I gonna do,
cry in my beer?

09:21.793 --> 09:24.428
If you did, I wouldn't
look down on you.

09:24.429 --> 09:27.431
It's not gonna bring him back.
All right?

09:27.432 --> 09:29.534
That's not the point.

09:29.535 --> 09:33.304
You suffered a big loss.

09:33.305 --> 09:34.805
We all did.

09:38.510 --> 09:41.979
Pull it together,
will you, al?

09:41.980 --> 09:45.616
I just... I didn't really
need that spigot!

09:45.617 --> 09:47.618
I just thought
maybe it would be nice

09:47.619 --> 09:50.254
To have some hot chocolate
once in a while.

09:53.725 --> 09:57.295
It devastates him
when they run out of corn nuts.

10:01.066 --> 10:03.767
Oh, good. Guys, hold it.
Hold it. Hold it.

10:03.768 --> 10:07.805
I got 250 flyers
I gotta send out
for the library fund-raiser.

10:07.806 --> 10:12.577
I gotta stuff 'em,
fold them, stamp them,
address them tonight.

10:12.578 --> 10:14.612
Who wants to volunteer?
Good luck.

10:14.613 --> 10:16.013
See ya.
Bye.

10:16.014 --> 10:18.082
Who wants their allowance
this week?
I'll help.

10:18.083 --> 10:20.351
So will I.
Me too.

10:20.352 --> 10:23.387
I knew I could
count on you boys.
There you go.

10:23.388 --> 10:26.023
Looks like mom's
suckered you guys
into helping out.

10:26.024 --> 10:28.926
Uh-huh. You're next.
Hi.

10:28.927 --> 10:31.061
So how was your day?

10:32.297 --> 10:34.432
John binford died.

10:34.433 --> 10:37.067
What?
He had a massive
heart attack.

10:37.068 --> 10:39.069
You're not gonna make us
go to the funeral.

10:39.070 --> 10:41.305
There's no way I'm going.

10:41.306 --> 10:43.307
Hey, guys, be quiet for a sec.
When is the funeral gonna be?

10:43.308 --> 10:44.908
Tuesday at noon.

10:44.909 --> 10:46.910
A school day.

10:46.911 --> 10:49.813
Oh... Poor
mr. Binford.

10:51.250 --> 10:54.118
Yeah, I really loved him.

10:54.119 --> 10:56.287
Will you guys
show a little respect?

10:56.288 --> 10:58.122
Yeah, please.

10:58.123 --> 11:00.991
Why don't you guys get changed?
Let's go play some basketball
at the y.

11:00.992 --> 11:01.992
Yeah!

11:01.993 --> 11:03.394
Honey, why basketball?

11:03.395 --> 11:04.762
What about john binford?

11:04.763 --> 11:06.664
I don't think he can play
in his condition.

11:09.200 --> 11:13.103
Tim, don't you wanna
talk about this?
Not really.

11:13.104 --> 11:15.439
Well, I'd like
to talk about it.

11:15.440 --> 11:17.441
Why don't you call al?

11:19.077 --> 11:22.680
I don't wanna talk to al.
I wanna talk to you.

11:22.681 --> 11:25.650
I mean, john binford
meant a lot to both of us.

11:25.651 --> 11:27.718
He not only gave you
your first job,

11:27.719 --> 11:30.554
He loaned us the money
for this house.

11:30.555 --> 11:34.224
He was the first person there
when all the boys were born.

11:34.225 --> 11:37.695
He was a sweet,
wonderful man.

11:37.696 --> 11:39.697
You're not gonna cry,
are ya?

11:39.698 --> 11:41.565
Well, yeah, I might.

11:41.566 --> 11:44.134
What is it
with everybody today?
You're crying.

11:44.135 --> 11:47.237
Al, today at big mike's,
was blubbering like a baby.

11:47.238 --> 11:49.607
Honey, there is
nothing wrong with crying

11:49.608 --> 11:51.609
When somebody
close to you dies.

11:51.610 --> 11:55.012
It wasn't just his crying.
He was singing "oh, danny boy."

11:57.282 --> 11:58.683
Dad, we're ready.

11:58.684 --> 12:01.852
All right. Why don't you guys
head out to the car?

12:01.853 --> 12:05.523
You are avoiding your emotions.
I know you've gotta
be feeling something.

12:05.524 --> 12:07.792
I'm feeling like playing
a little basketball.

12:07.793 --> 12:10.528
And I wish everybody would
mind their own business
about this.

12:10.529 --> 12:13.297
John is dead. He's gone.
End of the line.

12:13.298 --> 12:16.033
Next stop, tool heaven!

12:23.875 --> 12:24.908
Ball.

12:39.358 --> 12:41.392
All right, sodas
for the winners

12:41.393 --> 12:44.729
In the biggest
basketball victory
in ymca history.

12:44.730 --> 12:46.731
Huh. Yeah, some victory -

12:46.732 --> 12:48.799
You and brad
beating me and mark.

12:48.800 --> 12:52.803
Who you gonna take on next?
Nana and grandpa?

12:52.804 --> 12:56.440
Forget about it!
Nana's way too tough
under the boards.

12:57.642 --> 13:00.310
I think we should take on
nana and grandpa.

13:00.311 --> 13:02.747
Good, mark.

13:02.748 --> 13:04.448
What do you wanna drink?

13:04.449 --> 13:06.216
How about a brewski?

13:06.217 --> 13:07.852
How about a root brewski?

13:07.853 --> 13:10.087
Dad, I was real proud
of you tonight.

13:10.088 --> 13:12.990
Thanks. It wasn't easy
driving to the basket
against mark.

13:12.991 --> 13:15.526
I'm talking about what happened
with mr. Binford.

13:15.527 --> 13:17.795
I think you've been
taking it like a man.

13:17.796 --> 13:20.297
Well, I don't think
mom thinks so.

13:20.298 --> 13:23.267
She thinks I should get all
teary-eyed over this thing.

13:23.268 --> 13:25.269
That would be stupid.

13:25.270 --> 13:27.137
It wouldn't be stupid.

13:27.138 --> 13:28.839
Dad, guys don't cry.

13:28.840 --> 13:30.274
Yes, guys cry.

13:30.275 --> 13:32.576
Like when?

13:32.577 --> 13:34.612
If you scratch the paint
on that hot rod, you watch...

13:35.881 --> 13:38.849
Yeah, but you don't cry.
How do you know that?

13:38.850 --> 13:40.851
'cause you don't
let stuff get to you.

13:40.852 --> 13:42.853
Stuff gets to me.

13:42.854 --> 13:44.855
Well, the great part is,
no one can tell.

13:52.664 --> 13:56.099
<i>(wilson humming)</i>

13:58.804 --> 14:00.805
<i>(door shuts)</i>

14:01.907 --> 14:04.608
Hey, wilson.
Hi-ho, tim.

14:04.609 --> 14:06.343
What are you doing?

14:06.344 --> 14:10.247
I'm aerating my lawn
with my new steel-tipped
aerator sandals.

14:11.483 --> 14:14.652
Do you ever cry, wilson?

14:14.653 --> 14:18.622
Anytime I step on my foot
with one of these
silly sandals.

14:18.623 --> 14:20.958
Yeah, I can understand that.

14:20.959 --> 14:23.360
No, seriously.
Do you ever cry?

14:23.361 --> 14:26.464
Well, tim, I have been known
to weep on occasion.

14:26.465 --> 14:30.033
Well, I'm not much
in the tears department.

14:30.034 --> 14:33.637
I'm afraid
brad is growing up thinking
that's the way it should be.

14:33.638 --> 14:35.272
And that bothers you?

14:35.273 --> 14:37.140
Kind of, yeah.

14:37.141 --> 14:42.179
Hmm. Does this
have anything to do
with mr. Binford?

14:42.180 --> 14:44.181
How'd you hear about that?

14:44.182 --> 14:47.751
Jill told me she needed
somebody to talk to.

14:47.752 --> 14:51.121
She said you were out
shooting hoops.

14:51.122 --> 14:53.491
You know, wilson,
the trouble is,

14:53.492 --> 14:55.893
Binford and I were
really, really close,

14:55.894 --> 14:59.196
And I seem like
I'm the only person
not crying about this.

14:59.197 --> 15:01.732
Why do you think that is?

15:03.267 --> 15:05.636
I don't know. As long
as I can remember,
I've been like this.

15:05.637 --> 15:09.172
When my father died,
I know I was real sad,
but I don't remember crying.

15:09.173 --> 15:12.376
Well, tim, maybe crying
isn't your outlet.

15:12.377 --> 15:16.013
The shedding of tears
is just one way
that people mourn.

15:16.014 --> 15:18.348
<i>(grunts)</i> oh?
Oh, yes.

15:18.349 --> 15:20.384
In parts of mexico,
the bereaved

15:20.385 --> 15:23.086
Decorate the grave
with smiling puppets,

15:23.087 --> 15:25.122
And then they eat
chocolate coffins.

15:25.123 --> 15:27.925
Melts in your mouth,
but not in the ground.

15:27.926 --> 15:29.359
On the solomon islands,

15:29.360 --> 15:33.631
They hang
the dead man's arms
on his hut.

15:33.632 --> 15:35.933
And in feudal japan,
when a lord died,

15:35.934 --> 15:37.968
The ronin samurai
would show their loyalty

15:37.969 --> 15:40.838
By disemboweling
themselves.

15:40.839 --> 15:43.240
Whew, talk about guts.

15:46.945 --> 15:50.047
Point is, tim, when you lose
somebody who's close to you,

15:50.048 --> 15:52.783
You have to find a way
to mourn.

15:54.553 --> 15:56.554
It's what enables you
to accept the fact

15:56.555 --> 15:59.023
That person is really,

15:59.024 --> 16:03.193
Truly... Gone.

16:03.194 --> 16:04.494
<i>(grunts)</i> yeah.

16:04.495 --> 16:06.430
Thanks, wilson.
That was real...

16:12.003 --> 16:15.105
Hey, where have you been?

16:15.106 --> 16:17.441
Well, let's see.

16:17.442 --> 16:20.945
After I ate dinner alone,
then I went to the mailbox
and mailed the 250 flyers

16:20.946 --> 16:23.981
Which I stuffed, stamped
and addressed myself

16:23.982 --> 16:26.584
Because you took the boys
to play basketball.

16:26.585 --> 16:28.886
I should have stuck around
and talked to you.

16:28.887 --> 16:30.955
I would have
preferred that, yeah.

16:33.391 --> 16:36.994
I'm sorry, jill,
but, you know, I didn't know
how to talk about this stuff.

16:36.995 --> 16:39.496
I'm really uncomfortable
with this death thing.

16:39.497 --> 16:41.765
Which is why we have kids
instead of pets,

16:41.766 --> 16:43.767
'cause they last longer.

16:52.477 --> 16:55.980
Honey, I knew that
you were upset about it.

16:55.981 --> 16:59.049
But, you know,
you didn't know why.

16:59.050 --> 17:00.350
John binford

17:00.351 --> 17:03.087
Was the greatest guy
in the world to me.

17:03.088 --> 17:06.690
And you know what the
first thing I thought about
when I heard he was dead?

17:06.691 --> 17:10.292
Are they gonna cancel
the show? Am I out of a job?
That is so selfish.

17:10.294 --> 17:12.930
I don't think
that's selfish.

17:12.931 --> 17:15.098
You were thinking about
the welfare of your family.
It's not selfish.

17:15.099 --> 17:17.334
What if I told you
I was worried if the show
went off the air,

17:17.335 --> 17:20.337
No one would recognize me
at the mall?

17:20.338 --> 17:22.571
That would be
a selfish thing, yeah.

17:22.573 --> 17:26.109
I just don't know how to mourn
for john binford.

17:26.111 --> 17:28.712
Is there anything
I can do to help you?

17:28.713 --> 17:32.983
No. I'm pretty sure that people
have to learn how to mourn
for themselves.

17:32.984 --> 17:35.786
People mourn in
different cultures
in different ways.

17:35.787 --> 17:38.722
In some cultures, they put
chocolate puppets in coffins.

17:40.625 --> 17:43.027
In the chinoogie islands,
or someplace,

17:43.028 --> 17:45.896
They actually hang arms
on aluminum siding

17:45.897 --> 17:47.965
As a way to do this.

17:47.966 --> 17:49.633
And ronny the samurai -

17:49.634 --> 17:52.402
You don't even wanna know
what he does.

17:52.403 --> 17:55.572
I don't know, tim.
It may take a while,

17:55.573 --> 17:59.309
But I think that
you're gonna find
a way to grieve.

17:59.310 --> 18:02.546
You know, I just hope that
you don't cut anything off.

18:05.150 --> 18:07.651
Does everybody know
what time it is?

18:07.652 --> 18:09.319
<i>(all)</i> tool time!

18:09.320 --> 18:11.321
That's right. Binford tools
is proud to present

18:11.322 --> 18:13.957
Tim "the tool man" taylor.

18:13.958 --> 18:15.125
Whoo!

18:16.127 --> 18:18.428
<i>(grunting)</i>

18:19.864 --> 18:21.865
Thank you, heidi,
and thank you, everybody.

18:21.866 --> 18:24.301
Welcome to <i>tool time.</i> I am
tim "the tool man" taylor.

18:24.302 --> 18:27.370
You all know my assistant -
al "cry me a river" borland.

18:27.371 --> 18:29.239
Ha-ha-ha.

18:29.240 --> 18:31.274
If I didn't let
my feelings out, tim,

18:31.275 --> 18:34.211
I would not be
the man I am today.

18:34.212 --> 18:36.880
That's food for thought,
isn't it?

18:36.881 --> 18:39.516
Anyway, today, we're gonna
talk about john binford.

18:39.517 --> 18:42.319
Founder of binford tools.

18:42.320 --> 18:45.589
Uh, john binford
passed away this Thursday.

18:45.590 --> 18:48.892
And, um... John binford
was a heck of a guy.

18:48.893 --> 18:51.661
He was the kind of guy
you could call 24 hours a day
if anything as bothering you.

18:51.662 --> 18:54.064
He was always there for you.

18:54.065 --> 18:57.367
The kind of guy
who would forgive someone
for being curt.

18:59.537 --> 19:02.172
Or russell or whatever
your name might be.

19:04.943 --> 19:07.211
Uh... John binford
believed in me

19:07.212 --> 19:09.679
When I was just
a tool salesman
many years ago.

19:09.680 --> 19:12.916
He handpicked me to host
what has now become...

19:12.917 --> 19:15.886
Michigan's fourth-highest-rated
cable tool show.

19:19.924 --> 19:25.695
I owe a lot to john binford.
In his honor, I've made him
a special tombstone. Al.

19:30.568 --> 19:33.270
This is outta one piece
of michigan limestone.

19:33.271 --> 19:35.405
I'm very impressed, tim.

19:35.406 --> 19:36.907
Thanks, al.

19:36.908 --> 19:39.342
I chiseled this out of limestone
in the shape of a claw hammer,

19:39.343 --> 19:41.478
Which is the first hammer
that binford designed.

19:41.479 --> 19:42.780
Yes, it was.

19:42.781 --> 19:45.182
John once told me that...

19:45.183 --> 19:48.351
With the right tool,
you can fix anything.

19:48.352 --> 19:50.020
Huh.

19:50.021 --> 19:52.355
Unfortunately, um...

19:52.356 --> 19:55.725
There's no tool that can fix
how I'm feeling right now.

19:55.726 --> 19:57.394
I'm gonna miss you, john.

19:58.997 --> 20:02.565
You know, I think we should
bid john farewell

20:02.566 --> 20:05.568
In the <i>tool time</i> fashion -

20:05.569 --> 20:07.570
A little tribute
to john binford

20:07.571 --> 20:11.141
With a binford
21 nail-gun salute.

20:17.816 --> 20:20.984
Do you... Think this is
a little dangerous, tim?

20:20.985 --> 20:23.287
No, wait. Warren,
the protective drop cloth,
please.

20:24.455 --> 20:25.956
Have you tried this?

20:25.957 --> 20:28.658
The drop cloths
will collect all the nails.
It'll be perfect.

20:28.659 --> 20:30.828
You've tried this?
Hold on, hold on.

20:30.829 --> 20:32.362
<i>(electronic whirring)</i>

20:35.099 --> 20:37.234
Klaus, some music, please.

20:37.235 --> 20:39.436
<i>(âª taps)</i>

20:43.441 --> 20:45.309
So long, johnny.

20:48.546 --> 20:49.612
<i>(chuckling)</i>

20:57.121 --> 20:59.156
Tim,
just be careful.

21:03.594 --> 21:05.162
Get the...

21:05.163 --> 21:07.231
Pull the...
Pull the plug!

21:10.201 --> 21:12.202
<i>(nail guns</i>
<i>continue firing)</i>

21:14.739 --> 21:16.940
Hey. That's all
of our show today.

21:16.941 --> 21:19.776
I'm tim "the tool man" taylor.
I gotta get outta here.

21:26.251 --> 21:28.252
Hi, guys.
How was the funeral?

21:28.253 --> 21:30.453
It was great.
There was tool reps
from everywhere.

21:30.454 --> 21:32.455
All these I remember
from the old days.

21:32.456 --> 21:35.092
You never saw so many
tear-stained beer bellies.

21:35.093 --> 21:38.628
And poor al, blubbering
about some water spigot?

21:40.131 --> 21:42.165
He was broken up about that,
wasn't he?

21:42.166 --> 21:44.968
Not as broken up
as you were.

21:44.969 --> 21:46.169
You cried?

21:46.170 --> 21:49.873
He cried
more than the widow.

21:49.874 --> 21:53.676
That's 'cause she didn't
have to pay for parking.

21:53.677 --> 21:56.513
I'm gonna go change.

21:56.514 --> 21:59.249
Dad, I can't believe
you cried.

21:59.250 --> 22:01.251
I can't believe
I did, either.

22:01.252 --> 22:03.253
I thought I said goodbye
on <i>tool time.</i>

22:03.254 --> 22:06.023
Once I started talking with
those guys, it just came out.

22:06.024 --> 22:10.827
But you know what?
After I was crying, I felt
like a pathetic old woman.

22:17.268 --> 22:20.437
Remember, if it doesn't
say "binford" on it...

22:20.438 --> 22:22.772
Somebody else's name
is probably there.

22:22.773 --> 22:24.541
<i>(musical flourish)</i>

22:31.649 --> 22:34.184
Stay down!
That brings us
to the next segment...

22:41.725 --> 22:43.593
I don't feel so good.
