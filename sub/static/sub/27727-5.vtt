(ENGINE REVVING)

00:06.480 --> 00:08.440
(TRAIN WHISTLE BLASTS)

00:53.600 --> 00:55.520
(CHEERING)

01:00.960 --> 01:02.960
Hello! Hello!

01:03.000 --> 01:05.640
What a surprise!

01:05.680 --> 01:08.760
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:08.800 --> 01:10.760
Thank you so much.

01:10.800 --> 01:12.760
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

01:14.640 --> 01:16.640
Thank you very much.

01:16.680 --> 01:20.000
Welcome. And coming up
in this week's show:

01:21.680 --> 01:25.640
Abbie is sideways on ice
in a 911 Turbo...

01:25.680 --> 01:29.320
...Richard drives Jim Clark's
beautiful Lotus 25...

01:30.720 --> 01:32.680
...and I nearly fall over.

01:34.240 --> 01:35.800
(CHEERING)

01:35.840 --> 01:37.680
That...

01:37.720 --> 01:39.520
-Exciting looking show.
-Right.

01:40.560 --> 01:42.560
That is all to come. Now...

01:42.600 --> 01:46.120
Hang on a minute.
Does that mean Howard
and Adrian aren't coming on?

01:46.160 --> 01:48.840
-No. Haven't got time.
-(LAUGHTER)

01:48.880 --> 01:51.560
We actually begin
with the French.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.920
Er... now, they don't make
a sports car very often,

01:53.960 --> 01:57.200
but when they do,
literally nobody buys it.

01:58.360 --> 02:01.320
We've had
the Venturi Atlantique,

02:01.360 --> 02:04.120
and then there was
the Matra Murena,

02:04.160 --> 02:06.880
and then there was
the Simca Sport.

02:06.920 --> 02:11.560
And all of them fell down the
back of the sofa of history.

02:11.600 --> 02:14.360
Yeah, yeah, but you're
conveniently forgetting
to mention

02:14.400 --> 02:16.800
the best of the French
sports car makers.

02:16.840 --> 02:18.880
That's like saying the best
of the airborne plagues.

02:18.960 --> 02:21.440
-No.
-The best of the...

02:21.520 --> 02:23.080
No, it isn't.
There is one French maker

02:23.120 --> 02:25.600
that's been consistently good
at making sports cars,

02:25.600 --> 02:28.840
and they've made a new one,
and I've been testing it.

02:39.720 --> 02:41.600
JAMES: It's called the A110,

02:42.680 --> 02:44.440
and it's made by Alpine,

02:44.440 --> 02:46.160
a French sports car firm

02:46.160 --> 02:48.360
who have a history
of hitting the spot.

02:51.080 --> 02:53.480
The original A110,
for example,

02:53.520 --> 02:58.160
won the World Rally
Championship in 1973.

02:58.200 --> 02:59.960
And it's that car
that gives the new one

03:00.000 --> 03:04.040
not only its name
but also its looks.

03:14.760 --> 03:16.320
So, what we have here

03:16.360 --> 03:19.600
is a small, pure,
no-nonsense sports car

03:19.640 --> 03:25.200
aimed squarely at the Porsche
Cayman and the Audi TT.

03:25.240 --> 03:28.880
And this, unfortunately, is
where the problems begin.

03:30.880 --> 03:36.600
You see, this launch version
of the Alpine costs £51,000.

03:36.640 --> 03:38.200
£51,000.

03:38.240 --> 03:42.240
Now, for £1,000 more,
you can have the TT RS.

03:42.280 --> 03:45.000
That's the one Clarkson was
driving in the last series.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.080
And that's more powerful,
and it's faster.

03:50.800 --> 03:53.280
And the Porsche Cayman
you buy for £51,000

03:53.320 --> 03:57.000
is also more powerful than
this, and it's a Porsche.

03:57.040 --> 03:59.080
Whereas this is an Alpine.

03:59.120 --> 04:02.240
That's something you're going
to have to explain when
you're down the pub.

04:06.200 --> 04:08.480
Even the engine
sounds a bit lame.

04:09.880 --> 04:11.880
I don't mean
the noise it makes,

04:11.920 --> 04:14.840
I mean when somebody asks
you, "What's that got, then,
mister?"

04:14.880 --> 04:20.760
Because the answer is,
"A four-cylinder
1.8-litre turbo, sonny!"

04:20.800 --> 04:23.880
For over £50,000.
I mean, is that it?

04:28.360 --> 04:32.120
Also, I'm not sure
about the looks.

04:32.160 --> 04:37.360
The original 1960s version
was a masterpiece.

04:37.360 --> 04:40.800
But for me, this modern
reboot doesn't quite work.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.680
The problem, I think,
is that on modern cars

04:48.720 --> 04:52.320
there are rules about things
like how high the headlights
are above the ground,

04:52.360 --> 04:55.360
how forgiving the bonnet is
if you run into a pedestrian.

04:55.440 --> 05:00.560
And once you stretch
modern legislation
over 1960s design language,

05:00.600 --> 05:03.800
you end up with a sort of
slightly lame tribute act.

05:05.520 --> 05:07.920
So, is there anything good
to report?

05:09.240 --> 05:11.240
Well, thankfully, yes.

05:13.360 --> 05:16.920
For starters, although
Alpine is owned by Renault,

05:16.920 --> 05:22.800
this car is not just a
hot Mégane dressed up
in some fancy suit.

05:22.880 --> 05:26.800
The A110 is in fact
a mid-engined,
rear-drive sports car

05:26.880 --> 05:30.560
designed from scratch,
on a clean sheet of paper.

05:35.480 --> 05:38.440
The body and the chassis are
made entirely of aluminium.

05:38.480 --> 05:41.360
And the reason for that
is simple - its lightness.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.680
And from that starting point,
the Alpine engineers

05:43.720 --> 05:45.760
nerded their way
through the rest of the car

05:45.800 --> 05:49.200
and shaved off every
spare gram they could find.

05:51.120 --> 05:53.960
The seats, for example,
are half the weight

05:54.000 --> 05:57.360
of the ones you'll find
in any hot Renault.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.720
The handbrake is built
into the main callipers,

05:59.760 --> 06:06.000
rather than being separate,
saving another 2.5 kilos.

06:06.040 --> 06:09.840
Even the stereo is a bespoke,
lightweight design.

06:12.160 --> 06:14.120
And then there's
this boot at the front,

06:14.160 --> 06:17.520
which is just deep enough
for a small suitcase like
this one.

06:17.560 --> 06:21.600
But now I think about it,
putting the suitcase in there
would just add weight.

06:21.640 --> 06:25.600
So what I would do is just
pack my overnight stuff
straight in there.

06:25.640 --> 06:27.600
The only downside is
that in the morning,

06:27.640 --> 06:30.280
I have to go outside if
I want a fresh pair of pants.

06:34.400 --> 06:37.480
So, thanks to Alpine's
fanatical diet regime,

06:37.520 --> 06:43.000
this car is 300 kilos lighter
than a Cayman or an Audi TT.

06:44.760 --> 06:47.200
And that has
a profound effect.

06:50.800 --> 06:52.680
Suddenly,
it doesn't really matter

06:52.720 --> 06:56.680
that you've only got 1.8
litres and 248 horsepower.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.880
This thing absolutely
zips along.

07:03.120 --> 07:04.880
Nought to 60,
four and a half seconds.

07:07.080 --> 07:10.120
Top speed limited
to 155 miles an hour.

07:15.440 --> 07:17.120
And then,
when you get to a corner...

07:18.160 --> 07:20.600
(TYRES SCREECH)

07:20.640 --> 07:23.440
...you find out just
how agile this thing is.

07:31.240 --> 07:32.680
(LAUGHS)

07:33.800 --> 07:35.920
It's like driving a feather.

07:39.680 --> 07:41.960
(TYRES SCREECH)

07:42.000 --> 07:44.880
(CHUCKLES)

07:44.920 --> 07:48.320
It is like a cartoon car.
It should come with those
little bubbles saying...

07:56.800 --> 07:59.880
But even though the A110
is built to minimalist
principles,

07:59.920 --> 08:02.240
you never feel like
you're in some miserable,

08:02.280 --> 08:04.240
Spartan track-day car.

08:05.960 --> 08:08.040
It has air-con, sat-nav,

08:08.080 --> 08:10.680
phone connectivity -

08:10.720 --> 08:12.560
all the modern things
you want.

08:15.480 --> 08:17.960
This whole lightness
and smallness thing

08:18.000 --> 08:23.520
cascades down in a sort
of waterfall of pure joy.

08:23.560 --> 08:26.120
Lower weight means you
don't need such big tyres,

08:26.160 --> 08:27.720
you don't need so much grip.

08:27.760 --> 08:30.480
That gives the car more feel.

08:30.520 --> 08:35.680
Low weight means you use
less fuel, you make
lower emissions.

08:35.720 --> 08:39.640
It's just win-win-win-win
all the way.

08:39.640 --> 08:43.760
This is actually
the most intelligent car
I've driven for years.

08:45.480 --> 08:47.600
And I love it for that.
I love it.

09:00.360 --> 09:02.760
(CHEERING)

09:02.840 --> 09:05.000
Thank you.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.400
Erm...

09:07.840 --> 09:11.960
So... So despite
the ordinary engine,

09:12.000 --> 09:13.880
the looks that
you're not sure about,

09:13.960 --> 09:16.440
and the high price,
you liked it?

09:16.480 --> 09:18.240
I did. I loved it, yeah.

09:18.280 --> 09:20.320
-Yes, but would you buy one?
-I have.

09:21.360 --> 09:22.960
(LAUGHTER)

09:23.000 --> 09:24.840
-You've bought one of those?
-I have.

09:24.880 --> 09:26.720
And actually,
so has Gordon Murray.

09:26.760 --> 09:28.400
I've brought
a picture of him along. Him.

09:28.440 --> 09:31.280
He designed the McLaren F1,
so he knows.

09:31.320 --> 09:35.640
Yeah, so it's the
sports car of choice for
old men with terrible shirts.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.520
-So that's good to know.
JEREMY: Evidently.

09:37.600 --> 09:42.200
But, now let's see how fast
it goes round the Eboladrome,
shall we?

09:43.720 --> 09:45.480
And she's off.

09:45.520 --> 09:48.840
Brisk start, and a parp from
the exhaust on the up-change.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.040
Immediately onto
the Isn't Straight.

09:51.080 --> 09:55.480
And actually,
that's not hanging around.

09:55.520 --> 09:58.280
Perhaps James was right
about the benefits of...

09:58.320 --> 10:01.040
whatever it was
he was saying.

10:01.080 --> 10:04.520
Howling round
the final bend of the Isn't.

10:04.600 --> 10:09.760
Dropping down now
into Your Name Here.

10:09.840 --> 10:11.600
Scrubbing off speed
in a hurry.

10:11.640 --> 10:15.880
Torturing those tyres, but
that does look pretty nimble.

10:15.960 --> 10:19.760
Now, the canter back down
the Isn't, picking up speed.

10:21.640 --> 10:23.600
Dab of brakes
at the mid-point.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.520
Now much harder
on the brakes,

10:27.600 --> 10:30.880
flicking down the seven-speed
box for Old Lady's House.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.760
Any understeer?

10:32.840 --> 10:34.840
No, not bad
for a mid-engined car

10:34.880 --> 10:36.880
with no weight over the nose.

10:36.880 --> 10:39.760
I actually rather
like the styling of this,

10:39.840 --> 10:41.480
and I'm right.

10:41.520 --> 10:43.600
Just Field of Sheep
to go now.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.200
Here we are.

10:46.240 --> 10:48.840
And oh, yes, that's an
exuberant drift to finish,

10:48.880 --> 10:50.200
and across the line!

10:51.600 --> 10:53.400
Very good.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.440
Very good.
Good driving, on form.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.120
(RICHARD MUTTERS)

10:57.160 --> 10:59.640
Right.

10:59.640 --> 11:02.800
Right, let's see where it
goes on our lap board.

11:02.840 --> 11:05.800
Will it go in the top ten?

11:05.840 --> 11:07.840
Oh, dear, no, it doesn't.

11:07.880 --> 11:09.320
Sorry, May, that is dismal

11:09.360 --> 11:12.000
for a mid-engined car.
It is.

11:12.040 --> 11:15.040
It isn't about things like
lap times. I told you before.

11:15.080 --> 11:17.240
He who is first
shall be last,

11:17.280 --> 11:19.400
and the last
shall be first.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.240
-Yes, but it's 15th.
-It is, yeah.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.520
-It is, it is. (LAUGHS)
-So?

11:23.560 --> 11:27.040
It's the Romain Grosjean
of cars, that is.

11:27.080 --> 11:28.600
-Romain who?
-Grosjean.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.840
-Who's he?
-He's a French racing driver.

11:30.880 --> 11:34.080
The 15th best Formula One
driver in the world, in fact.

11:34.120 --> 11:35.880
-You'd like him.
-I already do.

11:35.920 --> 11:37.800
Good. Good,
so we've sorted that out.

11:37.840 --> 11:40.600
It's time for us to move on,
because right now it is time

11:40.640 --> 11:45.080
for us to scrump
an apple of chat

11:45.120 --> 11:47.680
from the orchard
of intercourse,

11:47.720 --> 11:50.800
which is on
Conversation Street.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.760
(JAZZ PLAYING)

11:56.960 --> 11:58.960
-I like that one.
-I thought you would.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.520
-I like that one a lot.
-That's so up your street.

12:02.560 --> 12:05.480
Um...right now, lots of
people these days

12:05.520 --> 12:07.240
are buying old cars,

12:07.280 --> 12:09.040
and we think we can see why.

12:09.080 --> 12:11.960
Yeah, because an old
Jaguar E-Type,
or Alfa Spider,

12:12.000 --> 12:14.960
is far more interesting to
look at than any modern car,

12:15.000 --> 12:16.440
and it won't depreciate.

12:16.480 --> 12:18.160
In fact,
it'll make you money.

12:18.200 --> 12:21.200
Yeah, the trouble is, though,
you get into your old car,

12:21.240 --> 12:23.200
and it's crap.

12:24.360 --> 12:25.680
He's absolutely right,

12:25.720 --> 12:27.720
we forget how terrible
old cars were, really.

12:27.760 --> 12:30.080
I mean, if you go more
than 40 miles an hour,

12:30.120 --> 12:33.040
the windscreen wipers part
company with the windscreen.

12:33.080 --> 12:36.360
-Yes.
-And the headlamps are
like candles in jam jars.

12:36.400 --> 12:38.760
-And the demister doesn't.
-No, it doesn't.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.440
-And the heater doesn't.
-No.

12:40.480 --> 12:42.320
And everything else rattles,
and the brakes don't work.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.480
-Exactly.
-That's old cars,
they were...

12:44.520 --> 12:47.640
I speak from experience.
I've got a 40-year-old
Ferrari, a 308.

12:47.680 --> 12:52.320
Apart from all those things,
it's catastrophically slow.
You wouldn't believe it.

12:52.360 --> 12:54.760
I pull away from lights,
and people behind honk
because they think,

12:54.800 --> 12:56.360
-"That's a Ferrari,
that'll... Oh."
-Yeah.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.920
They honk? Doesn't that
happen in any car you drive?

12:58.960 --> 13:01.240
-No, no, no--
-"Oh, get out of the way!"

13:01.280 --> 13:02.520
Pretty much.

13:02.560 --> 13:03.800
-But it is unbelievable
just how poor it is.

13:03.840 --> 13:05.240
RICHARD: Very slow.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.720
But that's the exact point
we're trying to make here.

13:07.760 --> 13:10.640
There are now loads of
companies who will take
an old car

13:10.680 --> 13:12.680
and then gently modernise it.

13:12.720 --> 13:15.280
Got some examples here
of what we're on about.

13:15.320 --> 13:18.200
There's this, which
is the Singer Porsche,

13:18.240 --> 13:19.640
I'm obviously not
very interested in that.

13:19.680 --> 13:21.720
These two are,
but I couldn't care less.

13:21.760 --> 13:24.840
Then you've got the Eagle,
er...E-Type Speedster,

13:24.880 --> 13:27.240
one of the best-looking cars
I've ever seen.

13:27.280 --> 13:31.240
That's an actual E-Type,
and one of the most beautiful
to drive. Absolute honey.

13:31.280 --> 13:34.760
Yeah, there's a company in
Germany now, and they are
modernising lightly.

13:34.800 --> 13:36.800
Remember those old
Mercedes Pagoda SLs?

13:36.840 --> 13:38.840
-Oh, yeah.
-They're putting
AMG engines in.

13:38.880 --> 13:41.880
What, mo... That's got a
modern AMG engine in it?

13:41.920 --> 13:44.320
RICHARD: Do you want to
have a look at the engine?
Another shot.

13:44.360 --> 13:46.080
-Hang on.
JEREMY: There it is,
look at that!

13:46.120 --> 13:48.880
RICHARD: That is a car.
JEREMY: I see you like that.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.840
-Very, very much.
-I've got something
you'll like more.

13:50.880 --> 13:53.080
-Have you?
-Mm-hm.

13:53.120 --> 13:55.080
RICHARD: Oh, my God!

13:55.120 --> 13:57.160
JEREMY: That is an old
'68 Dodge Charger.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.120
-You used to have one.
-I did.

13:59.160 --> 14:04.360
But someone has put
in that a 1,000-horsepower
modern-day Hellcat engine.

14:04.400 --> 14:05.920
Aw!

14:05.960 --> 14:07.480
-I mean...
-I...

14:07.520 --> 14:09.480
I need some time alone...

14:11.080 --> 14:13.320
-with that picture.
-It's just...

14:13.360 --> 14:15.800
JEREMY: That is such
a good idea, this, I think.

14:15.840 --> 14:17.520
It is actually, and
it's a very good point.

14:17.560 --> 14:21.000
We all think we would like
a Jensen Interceptor,
don't we?

14:21.040 --> 14:22.560
But the fact is it won't go,

14:22.600 --> 14:25.200
it won't stop if it ever does
go, the brakes won't work,

14:25.240 --> 14:26.800
all the rest of it -
terrible thing.

14:26.840 --> 14:29.280
But here is
a Jensen Interceptor,

14:29.320 --> 14:31.880
but that has modern brakes,
has a modern cooling system,

14:31.920 --> 14:34.320
and it has the engine
from a Corvette.

14:34.360 --> 14:37.080
No, it does. I've actually
driven that very car,
and it's epic.

14:37.120 --> 14:40.560
Well, that one isn't anymore,
because somebody wrapped it
round a fence in Goodwood.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.320
-Spoiled it.
-But it was epic before that.

14:42.360 --> 14:44.560
-It's a fantastic car,
it really, really is.
-(SQUEAKING)

14:44.600 --> 14:46.680
I'd like to explain, by the
way, that squeaking noise

14:46.720 --> 14:48.760
is not James thinking,
it's...

14:48.800 --> 14:49.840
(JEREMY LAUGHS)

14:49.880 --> 14:51.200
...it's the wind.

14:51.240 --> 14:53.520
-It's quite a breezy day.
-It's a breezy day.

14:53.560 --> 14:57.320
And we decided to base
ourselves in a tent because
we're mad.

14:57.360 --> 14:58.800
-And on a hill.
-And on a hill.

14:58.840 --> 15:00.120
But I think the problem

15:00.160 --> 15:01.960
with all of these
reimagined cars

15:02.000 --> 15:04.360
is that they're expensive,
they're too expensive.

15:04.400 --> 15:07.440
That Mercedes Pagoda SL,
that's £300,000,

15:07.480 --> 15:09.960
those Singer Porsches,
£400,000,

15:10.000 --> 15:13.600
that E-Type Speedster,
650 grand - it's just crazy.

15:13.640 --> 15:16.160
The problem is that
the companies who are
doing this kind of work,

15:16.200 --> 15:18.840
they know they can charge
that kind of money,

15:18.880 --> 15:20.880
cos the customers
that come to their workshops

15:20.920 --> 15:23.640
invariably arrive
in a helicopter

15:23.680 --> 15:28.120
with a Ukrainian girlfriend
and Lewis Hamilton's watch.

15:28.160 --> 15:30.360
And the fact is, if you're
gonna dress up like that

15:30.400 --> 15:32.080
and act like that,
if you're gonna show off,

15:32.120 --> 15:33.800
you'll get ripped off,
that's the way it is.

15:33.840 --> 15:36.600
-They charge accordingly,
don't they?
-That's asking for it.

15:36.640 --> 15:38.280
What you should do is
ring them up and say,

15:38.320 --> 15:40.360
"Could you collect me
from the station?"
That'd be better.

15:40.400 --> 15:43.680
No, the bus stop.
"Pick me up from
the bus stop,

15:43.720 --> 15:45.560
I've come to look at
these cars you're making."

15:45.600 --> 15:47.120
I've just had a thought.
Right, picture this.

15:47.160 --> 15:49.840
An original Opel Manta A.
Remember the one?

15:49.880 --> 15:51.840
-The round taillights?
-Yeah...yeah, black bonnet.

15:51.880 --> 15:54.960
But with the engine from a
modern Vauxhall VXR in it.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.840
So I just find some blokes
that'll do that for me,

15:57.880 --> 16:03.080
I do that on the phone, and
then I go and visit them on
the bus in a tracksuit.

16:03.120 --> 16:04.840
And you'll get charged
50 quid.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.600
Well, probably 40,
cos I need a tenner
to get home on the bus.

16:07.640 --> 16:08.680
(LAUGHTER)

16:08.720 --> 16:10.520
Ooh, now. (CLEARS THROAT)

16:10.560 --> 16:12.280
There's a new electric car

16:12.320 --> 16:14.440
from, you're not
going to believe this...

16:14.480 --> 16:16.800
-Kalashnikov.
-Really?

16:16.840 --> 16:20.480
Yeah, the people who make
AK-47s are going to start
making electric cars.

16:20.520 --> 16:21.760
I like the sound of that.

16:21.800 --> 16:24.560
Do you want to see
a picture of it? Here it is.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.560
RICHARD: Ah.
JAMES: Oh.

16:26.600 --> 16:30.040
No, don't laugh, because from
the back it's actually worse.

16:30.080 --> 16:32.720
-There you go.
RICHARD: You're right, it is.

16:32.760 --> 16:36.320
Now, I assumed that it would
have eight moving parts,

16:36.360 --> 16:39.240
that you could bury it
in a bog for three months

16:39.280 --> 16:41.320
and that it would only jam
if Richard Hammond used it.

16:41.360 --> 16:42.920
Yes, all right.

16:42.960 --> 16:46.440
But they say it has
revolutionary technology.

16:46.480 --> 16:49.640
Does it? Does it have
central locking, and loading?

16:49.680 --> 16:52.040
More importantly,
can you fire it in the air
at weddings?

16:52.080 --> 16:53.640
You probably would.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.640
"Exam results, children,"
they go out and do that.

16:55.680 --> 16:58.840
No, but I think the idea of
driving a car called
a Kalashnikov...

16:58.880 --> 17:00.880
-It sounds brilliant.
-Oh, yeah, pretty good.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.520
Yeah. "What are you
driving these days, Rich?"

17:03.560 --> 17:06.440
-"Well, it's a Kalashnikov."
-There you go.

17:06.480 --> 17:07.880
-There you go.
-The problem is,

17:07.920 --> 17:09.960
I reckon they're gonna
sell a lot of T-shirts

17:10.000 --> 17:12.160
and mugs and hats
with the name on,

17:12.200 --> 17:14.080
but not many actual cars.

17:14.080 --> 17:16.680
-Like Ferrari?
-Basically Ferrari, yeah.

17:16.720 --> 17:18.200
JEREMY: Oh, er, here's one.

17:18.240 --> 17:20.920
There's a story I got
from the Dorset Echo,

17:20.960 --> 17:23.520
which is a local newspaper
in Dorset.

17:23.560 --> 17:27.480
And, um... I think it wins
the award for unnecessary
reporting,

17:27.520 --> 17:29.520
because it's about
a crash that happened

17:29.560 --> 17:31.760
between
a motorcyclist and a tank.

17:31.800 --> 17:35.720
Happened... Yeah, happened
near that army base down
there. OK, and it says,

17:35.760 --> 17:39.560
"The motorcyclist sustained
a suspected fracture to his
arm and leg."

17:39.640 --> 17:41.560
And here's the line
they probably didn't need:

17:41.560 --> 17:43.440
"The driver of the tank
was uninjured."

17:43.480 --> 17:45.080
-Oh, was he?
-No?

17:45.160 --> 17:47.920
Well, he was lucky to get
away with that, wasn't he?

17:47.960 --> 17:50.680
- (LAUGHTER)
- Was he really?

17:50.720 --> 17:53.000
I suspect he got back to base
and went, "I hit a what?"

17:53.040 --> 17:55.320
"Did I?"

17:55.320 --> 17:57.320
Good conversation here,
I think.
Very good conversation.

17:57.400 --> 18:01.680
Because they've announced
a new type of motor racing
championship for women.

18:01.720 --> 18:03.720
It's called the W Series, OK?

18:03.760 --> 18:06.880
And the idea is is that
potentially quite good,
you know,

18:06.920 --> 18:10.720
women racing drivers
can take part in this
series.

18:10.760 --> 18:12.640
Cars are all
exactly the same,

18:12.680 --> 18:14.000
you're invited
to take part,

18:14.040 --> 18:17.040
and the prize money
is £1.1 million.

18:17.080 --> 18:19.720
So, it's, you know,
fairly incentivised.

18:19.760 --> 18:21.240
There's actually been
a lot of discussion about it,

18:21.280 --> 18:23.320
or actually debate,
I should say.

18:23.400 --> 18:27.000
Cos some people are
saying it's sexist to have a
women-only championship.

18:27.040 --> 18:29.800
But if you think about it,
you've got women-only
football, and rugby

18:29.880 --> 18:31.720
and hockey - all Olympic
sports, pretty much,

18:31.760 --> 18:33.240
are segregated
between men and women,

18:33.280 --> 18:35.080
so I can't see why motor
racing should be different.

18:35.080 --> 18:37.000
Not all sports, though.
Men and women compete

18:37.040 --> 18:39.400
directly against each other
in dressage.

18:39.440 --> 18:41.800
Yeah, but that's not a sport.
It isn't.

18:41.800 --> 18:45.080
That's just sitting on
a horse while it tries
to look camp.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.080
(LAUGHTER)

18:47.160 --> 18:48.800
All right, then, they can...

18:48.800 --> 18:50.640
JAMES: He's right.

18:50.680 --> 18:52.280
-(LAUGHS)
-It is, though.

18:52.320 --> 18:53.800
You're right, actually.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.880
There's no segregation, then,
between men and women

18:55.920 --> 18:57.720
in sailing, they compete
against each other.

18:57.760 --> 19:01.320
That's not a sport either,
is it? Sailing is a job.

19:01.400 --> 19:03.080
You have to pull
pieces of rope--

19:03.160 --> 19:04.880
-All right, then!
-It's manual labour.

19:04.920 --> 19:06.800
It's manual labour.
It's not a sport.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.800
There's a world of difference
between any of that

19:08.800 --> 19:11.080
and single-seater car racing.

19:11.080 --> 19:12.720
Why, though? Why is it?

19:12.760 --> 19:15.400
Is it, "Oh, well, you need
manly strength to do it?"

19:15.440 --> 19:17.480
Cos you don't, anyway,
cos even an F1 car

19:17.520 --> 19:19.040
has power steering
these days.

19:19.080 --> 19:21.400
But I was driving
a single-seater
race car the other day,

19:21.440 --> 19:23.640
I can't remember what or
where but it had slick tyres.

19:23.680 --> 19:26.760
After three laps,
my neck muscles had...
I was like this.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.560
I hadn't got the strength
to lift my head up,

19:28.560 --> 19:32.040
I had to wait for
the next corner
to roll over the other way.

19:32.080 --> 19:34.280
Now, I know, you know,
Navratilova and the Williams
girl,

19:34.320 --> 19:36.040
you wouldn't want to
arm-wrestle either of them,

19:36.080 --> 19:38.800
so women can build up their
muscles to compensate for that.

19:38.880 --> 19:41.280
So, wait, are you saying that
there should be segregation

19:41.320 --> 19:43.440
with women and men
in motor sport?

19:43.480 --> 19:44.880
Well, it doesn't really
matter what I think.

19:44.920 --> 19:47.520
The fact is, it's 43 years
since there was a...

19:47.560 --> 19:50.320
a girl in
a Formula One motor race.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.720
43 years. Something's going
wrong, they're not making it.

19:52.760 --> 19:55.000
I think it's grass roots.
It happens early on.

19:55.040 --> 19:58.800
I think too many mothers
put their little daughters
on ponies

19:58.880 --> 20:00.320
and not into go-karts.

20:00.320 --> 20:02.320
No, not entirely.

20:02.320 --> 20:05.280
Some girls do go karting,
cos Abbie, our driver,

20:05.320 --> 20:07.040
she was karting since
she was a little nipper.

20:07.080 --> 20:09.080
Well... I think what
this series is all about,

20:09.080 --> 20:11.080
it's not about segregation,
it's about encouraging women

20:11.080 --> 20:13.240
to go car racing, which
I think is a good idea.

20:13.280 --> 20:16.560
Yeah, I think it is,
but I think it has to
start early on. So,

20:16.560 --> 20:19.520
little girls, it's time
to get off your ponies,

20:19.560 --> 20:21.280
and get into a go-kart.

20:21.320 --> 20:25.800
And I can tell you actually,
from some experience
of horses,

20:25.800 --> 20:28.400
the good thing is, when you
walk out in the morning,

20:28.440 --> 20:30.160
you'll find that your go-kart

20:30.200 --> 20:32.560
hasn't crapped itself
and died in the night.

20:33.720 --> 20:35.720
So it's better
than your horse.

20:35.760 --> 20:38.000
You'll also find out that
go-karts are more fun

20:38.040 --> 20:39.880
than going on "an horse",
they just are.

20:39.920 --> 20:41.400
Yes, yes.
And you'll find also

20:41.440 --> 20:44.680
that a go-kart won't pop
its long, stupid head up

20:44.720 --> 20:46.920
over the stable door
and look at you,

20:46.960 --> 20:50.080
and you know it's thinking,
it's trying to say to you,

20:50.080 --> 20:53.040
"Yeah, your wife, she's back
here with me, in here."

20:53.080 --> 20:55.320
Er... she's given me
breakfast in bed,

20:55.400 --> 20:59.800
crapped myself last night,
but she's clearing that up
with a garden fork."

20:59.880 --> 21:02.000
And then it says,
"And my penis is a bit dirty.

21:02.040 --> 21:05.720
She'll be sorting that out
for me later on."

21:05.760 --> 21:08.040
Then your wife's head will
pop up over the stable door

21:08.080 --> 21:11.800
and she'll say, "Don't look
at him like that, he'll
think you don't like him,"

21:11.800 --> 21:13.560
and you'll say, "I know!"

21:13.640 --> 21:14.880
(LAUGHTER)

21:14.920 --> 21:17.800
If I could speak horse, I
would tell him, "I hate you.

21:17.880 --> 21:21.480
I hate the way you steal
my wife and my money

21:21.520 --> 21:23.640
and my status around here."

21:23.680 --> 21:27.200
And then one day, you'll
have a conversation with
your wife, and she'll say,

21:27.240 --> 21:31.440
"Darling, I need a trailer to
move my special horse around
to wonderful places

21:31.480 --> 21:33.280
because these fields
are too small for him

21:33.320 --> 21:35.640
to exercise his magnificent,
muscled legs."

21:35.680 --> 21:38.200
And you'll say,
"OK, I'll get you a trailer."

21:38.240 --> 21:39.720
Then she'll say,
"I need a special car

21:39.760 --> 21:41.880
to tow the special trailer
to carry the special horse."

21:41.920 --> 21:44.280
So you'll get one.
And then one day, she'll say,

21:44.320 --> 21:46.920
"I need a lorry,
a great big lorry,

21:46.960 --> 21:50.320
to carry my great,
big magnificent horse
around the country,

21:50.320 --> 21:53.720
and the lorry must have
a kitchen and a bed in it

21:53.760 --> 21:55.520
so I can sleep
close to my horse,

21:55.560 --> 21:57.680
closer to my horse
than I am to you."

21:57.720 --> 22:00.440
And at that moment,
your head will bow
and your heart will break,

22:00.480 --> 22:03.960
because you know you have
lost, and the horse has won.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.880
-(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
JAMES: That's very good.

22:09.280 --> 22:11.120
That is, um...

22:14.160 --> 22:16.120
-Slightly off.
-We trod on the H-bomb.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.920
Every time you mention the
horse word to him, he's off.

22:18.960 --> 22:20.640
Oh, did it again!

22:20.680 --> 22:23.000
I think we probably end...
Well, it's not
Conversation Street,

22:23.040 --> 22:24.600
that was Rant Street
from Hammond.

22:24.640 --> 22:27.240
-Sorry about that.
-Let's move it on, shall we?

22:27.280 --> 22:29.920
There's a new off-road
four-wheel drive Lamborghini.

22:29.960 --> 22:33.080
It's called the Urus, and
to find out if it's any good,

22:33.120 --> 22:35.280
I took The Grand Tour
to Sweden,

22:35.320 --> 22:37.760
armed with some questions.

22:49.560 --> 22:51.560
Here's my first big question:

22:51.600 --> 22:55.320
If you build a car
to tackle terrain like this,

22:55.360 --> 22:57.760
can it still be
a proper Lambo?

23:07.400 --> 23:09.480
Well, the Urus
certainly looks

23:09.520 --> 23:11.320
like a jacked-up supercar.

23:14.680 --> 23:16.520
With its swivel-eyed styling,

23:16.560 --> 23:18.520
it appears to be every
inch a Lamborghini.

23:21.280 --> 23:22.760
But is it?

23:25.360 --> 23:27.320
To make this car,
Lambo's engineers

23:27.360 --> 23:31.280
had a good rummage around
in Volkswagen's parts bin.

23:31.320 --> 23:35.200
So the engine,
a four-litre V8,
is from a Porsche Panamera.

23:35.240 --> 23:37.880
The rear axle
and air suspension

23:37.920 --> 23:40.280
is from
a Bentley Bentayga.

23:40.320 --> 23:42.080
The platform
on which it sits,

23:42.120 --> 23:47.040
and a lot of the dashboard,
is from an Audi SQ7.

23:47.080 --> 23:51.480
So, does that mean this isn't
really a Lamborghini at all?

23:54.960 --> 23:56.640
(ELECTRONIC BLEEP)

23:56.680 --> 23:58.600
(ENGINE REVVING)

24:09.720 --> 24:13.400
Well, it does 0-60
in 3.6 seconds.

24:16.120 --> 24:19.440
And it has a top speed
of 189.

24:24.320 --> 24:28.440
So, it has the performance
you'd expect.

24:28.480 --> 24:32.680
But there's other stuff
you wouldn't expect.

24:32.720 --> 24:35.560
This is the first Lamborghini
to use turbocharging,

24:35.600 --> 24:38.960
and the first
to have an automatic gearbox.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.880
What that combination means
is there's a very slight

24:41.920 --> 24:44.200
and rather
un-Lamborghini-ish gap

24:44.240 --> 24:47.680
between putting your foot
down and it getting going.

24:51.600 --> 24:53.720
And when it does get going,

24:53.760 --> 24:57.000
there are
no screaming histrionics.

24:57.040 --> 24:59.680
Sure, there's a bit of
popping and banging
from the back.

25:03.280 --> 25:05.160
But you can't hear
that inside,

25:05.200 --> 25:08.400
where everything is
muted and refined.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.080
Perhaps that's why
all the writing

25:10.120 --> 25:12.600
down here is in Latin.

25:12.640 --> 25:15.360
This is a Lamborghini for
emeritus professors.

25:15.400 --> 25:17.480
(ENGINE ROARS)

25:17.520 --> 25:19.480
I can see the Pope
in one of these.

25:24.960 --> 25:28.240
So, it's quiet
and a bit hesitant.

25:28.280 --> 25:29.880
And it has snazzy diffs

25:29.920 --> 25:31.880
and a clever
traction-control system.

25:31.920 --> 25:36.880
And the biggest carbon brakes
ever fitted to a road car.

25:36.920 --> 25:38.840
So it's safe as well.

25:40.880 --> 25:42.560
However, there's no
getting around the fact

25:42.600 --> 25:45.800
that I'm currently driving
on snow and ice

25:45.840 --> 25:51.680
in a car that has
641 horsepowers

25:51.720 --> 25:54.960
rampaging around
underneath its bonnet.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.920
(ENGINE REVVING)

25:58.720 --> 26:02.120
Which means that, actually,
it's not that safe at all.

26:04.400 --> 26:05.560
Ooh, God above.

26:08.640 --> 26:09.680
Concentrating.

26:12.040 --> 26:14.320
Twitchy and it's scary!

26:18.200 --> 26:19.840
It's like I've been
put in charge

26:19.880 --> 26:21.600
of all of the world's
physics,

26:21.640 --> 26:24.360
while I'm in a phone box
full of wasps.

26:25.600 --> 26:27.360
Ee! Stop, leave me alone!

26:27.400 --> 26:30.360
I'm doing tides
and gravity... Agh, stop!

26:32.560 --> 26:35.360
This car, then,
it sits right at the moment

26:35.400 --> 26:40.040
where excitement stops
and terror begins.

26:40.080 --> 26:42.760
That is Lambo land, that is.
(CHUCKLES)

26:42.800 --> 26:44.360
Shit!

26:52.280 --> 26:55.880
So, the Urus looks and feels
like a Lamborghini.

26:58.440 --> 27:02.480
It's also practical.
The boot is massive.

27:02.520 --> 27:06.240
And inside, there's space
for five six-footers.

27:07.880 --> 27:09.760
It's a nice place to be
as well.

27:10.840 --> 27:12.360
And all that's great.

27:15.240 --> 27:16.840
But does it work off-road?

27:19.960 --> 27:22.720
To find out,
I'm going to try and drive it

27:22.760 --> 27:24.640
to the top
of this ski resort.

27:24.680 --> 27:27.360
Now, it's wearing
these tyres,

27:27.400 --> 27:29.400
which have no studs
in them, or spikes.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.920
And I'm wearing these,

27:31.960 --> 27:36.680
which are not delicate
Italian driving shoes.

27:36.720 --> 27:38.720
Not sure
this is gonna go well.

27:40.680 --> 27:42.880
Problems actually get
worse when you're in here

27:42.920 --> 27:46.520
because there's no manual
locking differentials,

27:46.560 --> 27:48.240
there's no low-range gearbox.

27:48.280 --> 27:51.880
All you can do
is fire it up...

27:51.920 --> 27:54.560
and then put the drive
system into snow mode.

27:56.320 --> 27:58.320
Is... Is that snow?

27:58.360 --> 28:00.080
Is "Neve" Latin for snow?

28:01.880 --> 28:04.600
Think it might be.
So, let's see if that works.

28:04.640 --> 28:06.480
Here we go.

28:06.520 --> 28:09.160
Mustn't hit a skier, mustn't
hit a skier. Oh, it's moving.

28:12.080 --> 28:13.080
(CHUCKLES)

28:14.400 --> 28:17.920
The 165,000-pound Lamborghini

28:17.960 --> 28:20.840
is driving up a ski slope.

28:24.160 --> 28:26.360
Those turbo chargers
may be a little bit annoying

28:26.400 --> 28:28.400
on the road,
but here they're giving me

28:28.440 --> 28:32.160
the low-down torque that
I need to get up this hill.

28:34.680 --> 28:36.080
And I've got an inclinometer,

28:36.120 --> 28:38.720
like you used to get in
an old Mitsubishi Shogun.

28:39.800 --> 28:40.760
(CHUCKLES)

28:43.480 --> 28:46.600
This is actually quite
impressive, it's just
dropped down into first.

28:46.640 --> 28:48.560
(ENGINE REVVING)

28:53.600 --> 28:55.520
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!

28:59.440 --> 29:01.400
Hello,
bewildered-looking skiers.

29:05.240 --> 29:10.760
I cannot believe
that this is a 2.4-ton car...

29:10.800 --> 29:12.760
on normal road tyres,
and it's doing this.

29:16.400 --> 29:18.680
Come on, come on, come on,
you can do it. Come on.

29:18.720 --> 29:20.920
Come on, come on. Come on.

29:25.200 --> 29:27.200
Oh, hang on a minute.

29:27.240 --> 29:30.440
-(ENGINE REVVING)
-Yeah.

29:30.480 --> 29:35.480
Yeah, I now can believe it's
a 2.4-ton car on normal road
tyres cos it's stuck.

29:36.560 --> 29:38.720
-(ENGINE REVVING)
-No.

29:38.760 --> 29:40.720
-(COMPUTER BEEPS)
-Oh.

29:41.800 --> 29:43.040
Right.

29:44.520 --> 29:47.520
So, what we've established
so far is that,

29:47.560 --> 29:49.560
yes, it is a Lamborghini.

29:49.600 --> 29:52.480
Feels exciting like
a Lamborghini... should.

29:53.520 --> 29:55.520
And, um... I meant this.

29:55.560 --> 29:57.200
And, er... it's good
off-road as well,

29:57.240 --> 30:00.080
but just not quite
as good as a Range Rover.

30:03.160 --> 30:06.200
Which leaves us with
one more thing to answer:

30:06.240 --> 30:08.040
Is it a good laugh?

30:10.120 --> 30:12.600
What we've done
is use a snow plough

30:12.640 --> 30:15.760
to create a racetrack
on this frozen lake.

30:20.920 --> 30:24.480
And this is
what we have planned.

30:24.520 --> 30:26.720
I'm going to try
and overtake this,

30:26.760 --> 30:30.480
a four-wheel drive
Porsche 911 Turbo,

30:30.520 --> 30:36.120
which is being driven by
The Grand Tour's
racing driver Abbie Eaton.

30:36.160 --> 30:39.600
-Have you seen this crack?
-I hadn't noticed
that before.

30:39.640 --> 30:41.120
Look at the state of this!

30:41.160 --> 30:42.880
ABBIE: You're the heavier
car, aren't you?

30:42.920 --> 30:46.480
Hm, that's 2.4 tons,
and I weigh half a ton.

30:46.520 --> 30:49.440
Are you not worried
about that?

30:49.480 --> 30:52.840
I haven't got my seatbelt on,
so if it goes under, I can
get out straightaway.

30:52.880 --> 30:54.640
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

30:55.800 --> 30:58.520
JEREMY:
Before the duel began,

30:58.560 --> 31:00.920
I had a few practice laps
on my own.

31:05.720 --> 31:07.560
Oh, heavens.

31:07.600 --> 31:09.000
Come on, turn!

31:11.760 --> 31:13.640
Whoops, I'm going off a bit.

31:16.160 --> 31:17.600
Ooh!

31:19.200 --> 31:22.520
Ah, my Urus is a bit twitchy.

31:22.560 --> 31:24.320
Sort of thing
you'd say to your doctor.

31:26.520 --> 31:27.920
Right, flick it in there.

31:30.160 --> 31:31.800
Now go the other way,
and power.

31:35.080 --> 31:36.280
Oh, yeah.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.440
Mouse in, lion out.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.120
That's what
they say in Sweden.

31:45.880 --> 31:47.840
(CHUCKLES)

31:47.880 --> 31:52.040
I'm making my own fog now!

31:52.080 --> 31:56.720
It may not be able to get
as far up a ski slope
as a Range Rover,

31:56.760 --> 31:58.680
but for doing this,

31:59.960 --> 32:01.800
it's better.

32:01.840 --> 32:03.760
(LAUGHS)

32:06.200 --> 32:08.080
But, would it be good enough

32:08.120 --> 32:10.440
to get past Abbie
in that Porsche?

32:13.760 --> 32:15.760
There she is.

32:15.800 --> 32:17.520
There she is!

32:17.560 --> 32:19.160
(CHUCKLES)

32:21.760 --> 32:24.640
The bell has sounded,
the race is on.

32:27.880 --> 32:30.120
Now we'd find out what's what

32:30.160 --> 32:32.600
on our specially
designed track.

32:34.680 --> 32:36.640
Right, round the Bell End.

32:40.240 --> 32:41.720
Now down the Shaft...

32:43.760 --> 32:45.880
to what we're calling
the Parabollocka.

32:51.440 --> 32:54.280
I've raced against
a few dicks in my time
but never on one.

32:59.160 --> 33:01.480
I should be able to get her,
for heaven's sake, come on!

33:03.920 --> 33:06.720
She, of course, has four-
wheel-steering, same as I do.

33:10.120 --> 33:12.440
Oh, she has got better
braking than I have.

33:14.960 --> 33:17.480
Now, give me 641 horsepower!

33:22.000 --> 33:24.280
Oh, yeah.

33:24.320 --> 33:27.920
You know I said it was
a bit hesitant sometimes?

33:29.320 --> 33:31.040
Well, in Corsa mode,
it isn't.

33:35.680 --> 33:38.080
It's bob-on, this. Bob-on!

33:40.960 --> 33:43.720
Ooh, she's gone wide,
is there a chance here?

33:43.760 --> 33:44.720
Come on!

33:47.760 --> 33:49.560
Now, now!

33:52.360 --> 33:53.880
Bollocks.

33:53.920 --> 33:55.840
Come on now, Jeremy.

34:02.200 --> 34:03.720
Come on!

34:04.760 --> 34:06.720
Come on, you can have her!

34:08.680 --> 34:10.160
Come on!

34:18.920 --> 34:22.400
For lap after lap,
the big heavy Urus

34:22.440 --> 34:25.680
clawed at the rear end
of the 911 Turbo.

34:25.760 --> 34:27.880
Oh, God. Nearly!

34:29.080 --> 34:30.160
Now.

34:31.760 --> 34:35.480
But eventually,
I had to admit defeat.

34:35.520 --> 34:38.160
I can't get past that 911,
and that's just an end of it,

34:38.160 --> 34:39.880
but I can keep up.

34:40.960 --> 34:43.640
And in an off-road car...

34:43.640 --> 34:45.760
that is fairly
astonishing.

34:46.920 --> 34:48.480
It really is.

34:52.800 --> 34:55.960
Certainly, I can believe
Lamborghini's claim

34:56.000 --> 34:58.680
that this is the fastest
off-road car...

34:59.800 --> 35:01.600
in the world.

35:05.960 --> 35:08.640
(APPLAUSE)

35:08.640 --> 35:11.400
-That was quite good fun.
-Looked like fun, yeah.
A nice day out.

35:11.440 --> 35:13.160
-I got paid for that.
-That was your job.

35:13.200 --> 35:15.160
That is work.
Doing that is my work.

35:16.640 --> 35:18.880
Um... it probably won't be

35:18.920 --> 35:21.320
the fastest off-road car
in the world
for very long, though,

35:21.360 --> 35:23.880
because both Aston Martin
and Ferrari have got, er...

35:23.920 --> 35:26.160
-big SUVs
coming out this year.
-Yeah. Yeah.

35:26.200 --> 35:28.560
Whatever. Thing is,
could you really tell people

35:28.600 --> 35:30.480
that you have a Urus?

35:30.520 --> 35:34.600
Cos it... it sounds like a
minor alien out of Star Trek .

35:34.640 --> 35:36.800
-Yeah.
-But it does work
as a Lamborghini.

35:36.840 --> 35:38.880
Yeah. But no.

35:38.920 --> 35:41.560
Well, this is excellent
consumer advice.

35:41.600 --> 35:44.080
-I'm glad we...
-Yeah, it's very clear,
very clear.

35:44.120 --> 35:45.640
The thing is,
after I made that film,

35:45.680 --> 35:47.560
which was quite good fun,

35:47.600 --> 35:49.320
I came home and I thought,
the trouble is

35:49.360 --> 35:52.640
it could do with being
a bit more Aventador-ish.

35:52.680 --> 35:55.440
It could do with being
a bit more mad.

35:55.480 --> 35:57.080
Are you saying
you changed your mind?

35:57.120 --> 35:58.760
-Yes.
-Oh, great.

35:58.800 --> 36:00.960
So, Prime Minister Clarkson
returns from the summit:

36:01.000 --> 36:03.280
"I've declared war,
but on the plane home

36:03.320 --> 36:05.640
I had another think about it
and I'm not so sure now.

36:05.680 --> 36:07.760
-I've changed my mind."
-Exactly,
that's what I've done.

36:07.800 --> 36:10.040
Good, well,
since we're in such
a sensible frame of mind,

36:10.080 --> 36:12.080
I'd like to move
things on now,

36:12.120 --> 36:14.080
um, with a brief
history lesson.

36:15.160 --> 36:16.920
(ENGINES REVVING)

36:27.840 --> 36:31.200
RICHARD:
On April the 7th, 1968,

36:31.280 --> 36:34.280
a racing driver was killed
in a Formula Two race

36:34.320 --> 36:35.880
in Hockenheim, Germany.

36:38.160 --> 36:42.760
Sadly, the driver's death was
not a surprising occurrence,

36:42.800 --> 36:46.440
because such was the danger
of the sport back then,

36:46.480 --> 36:50.800
he was one of
127 racing drivers

36:50.840 --> 36:53.880
who would die at the wheel
that year alone.

36:56.120 --> 36:58.560
This time, though,
the death sent shockwaves

36:58.600 --> 37:00.520
through the motorsport world,

37:00.560 --> 37:03.880
because it had just lost the
man who was unquestionably

37:03.920 --> 37:06.880
the greatest
racing driver of his day,

37:06.920 --> 37:11.120
and who many argue is still
the greatest of all time.

37:16.920 --> 37:19.160
NEWSREADER: Jim Clark
has died in an accident

37:19.200 --> 37:22.920
during a Formula Two
race in West Germany.

37:22.960 --> 37:25.200
JACKIE STEWART: It was a
terrible shock to everybody.

37:25.280 --> 37:28.080
It really
knocked us all back.

37:28.120 --> 37:30.040
If there was anybody
who was not gonna have

37:30.080 --> 37:32.520
a fatal accident
it was Jim Clark.

37:32.560 --> 37:34.920
Because he drove
in such a way

37:34.960 --> 37:38.160
that he just
didn't do the mistakes

37:38.200 --> 37:39.640
that other drivers did.

37:42.160 --> 37:45.200
In California, a
radio station broadcaster

37:45.280 --> 37:47.880
announcing the news
of Clark's death

37:47.920 --> 37:52.560
asked his listeners
to turn on their headlights
as a mark of respect...

37:52.600 --> 37:55.200
and the freeways lit up.

37:58.040 --> 38:00.640
Such a huge global fuss

38:00.680 --> 38:03.680
would not have sat
easily with Clark,

38:03.760 --> 38:06.120
because this shy, modest man,

38:06.160 --> 38:08.120
the son of
a Scottish sheep farmer,

38:08.160 --> 38:10.880
was never one
to trumpet his own skills.

38:12.520 --> 38:14.200
JIM CLARK:
I started as an amateur

38:14.280 --> 38:17.960
with no idea or no intention
of becoming World Champion,

38:18.000 --> 38:21.440
But, er... it was,
I was curious to find out,

38:21.480 --> 38:24.400
um... what it was like
to drive a car fast,

38:24.440 --> 38:26.040
to drive on
a certain circuit,

38:26.080 --> 38:29.080
to drive
a certain type of car.

38:29.120 --> 38:31.920
Having cut his teeth
in sports car racing

38:31.960 --> 38:33.480
in the late '50s,

38:33.520 --> 38:35.040
Clark's speed and talent

38:35.080 --> 38:38.080
was spotted by Lotus boss
Colin Chapman,

38:38.120 --> 38:41.560
who signed him for his
Formula One team in 1960.

38:45.320 --> 38:49.920
Clark soon set
the motorsport world alight.

38:49.960 --> 38:52.320
Especially in this car...

38:54.880 --> 38:56.480
The Lotus 25.

38:58.560 --> 39:00.840
In which, in 1963...

39:02.560 --> 39:05.640
he won his first
F1 World Championship.

39:10.600 --> 39:12.080
Oh, my God!

39:12.120 --> 39:15.080
I am sitting
where Jim Clark sat.

39:18.080 --> 39:21.040
(LAUGHS)
This is electrifying!

39:25.760 --> 39:28.400
These were not powerful cars.

39:29.840 --> 39:32.640
They only made
210 brake horsepower

39:32.680 --> 39:35.040
from one and a half litres,

39:35.080 --> 39:38.160
but they were still good
for 180 miles an hour.

39:40.440 --> 39:41.840
Oh, ho!

39:44.080 --> 39:47.200
Thanks to its revolutionary
monocoque chassis,

39:47.280 --> 39:50.000
the 25
was stiffer and lighter

39:50.040 --> 39:52.160
than any other F1 car.

39:52.200 --> 39:56.080
Which meant it wasn't
just fast on the straights,

39:56.120 --> 39:58.320
but quicker
through the corners too.

39:59.560 --> 40:02.000
And in the 1963 season,

40:02.040 --> 40:04.920
Clark used it
to win a record seven

40:04.960 --> 40:07.320
out of the ten Grands Prix.

40:07.360 --> 40:09.280
COMMENTATOR:
Winner is Jim Clark.

40:09.320 --> 40:11.560
Nobody could
possibly catch him now.

40:14.760 --> 40:19.880
But 1963 was just a warm-up
for what was to come.

40:19.920 --> 40:22.880
To get a true picture
of Clark's genius,

40:22.920 --> 40:25.320
we must look at another year.

40:25.360 --> 40:27.480
1965.

40:27.520 --> 40:31.480
When he hit heights
no driver had reached before,

40:31.520 --> 40:33.480
or has done since.

40:36.560 --> 40:40.480
A modern Formula One
driver does 21 races a year

40:40.520 --> 40:42.760
and often complains
that's too many.

40:42.800 --> 40:47.880
In 1965,
Jim Clark raced in 63 races.

40:47.920 --> 40:49.080
Some of these cars
look similar,

40:49.120 --> 40:50.840
but they are all
completely different.

40:50.880 --> 40:53.960
In a car like this, he'd do
Formula One Championship.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.320
He raced in the British
Formula Two Championship,

40:56.360 --> 40:59.760
and the French Formula Two
Championship in this car.

40:59.800 --> 41:01.520
He raced in
the Tasman Series,

41:01.560 --> 41:05.280
a sort of Australian
Grand Prix for Down Under,
in this car.

41:05.320 --> 41:07.160
And then
there's this Lotus Cortina,

41:07.200 --> 41:09.840
in which he decided
to race in touring cars.

41:09.880 --> 41:12.000
And then if all that
wasn't enough,

41:12.040 --> 41:15.000
he decided to go for
the Indy 500.

41:17.280 --> 41:22.600
First up was the Tasman
Series in Australasia.

41:22.640 --> 41:24.000
Out of the 15 races,

41:24.040 --> 41:27.880
Clark won 11
and took the crown.

41:27.920 --> 41:33.440
Then it was back to Europe
for the British and French
Formula Two Championships,

41:34.880 --> 41:36.640
both of which he won.

RICHARD:
And in between the F2 races,

41:43.800 --> 41:46.160
he was jumping into
his Lotus Cortina

41:46.200 --> 41:48.640
and racking up
touring car victories.

41:50.200 --> 41:52.040
And, on top of all that,

41:52.080 --> 41:53.440
there was America.

The Indianapolis 500

41:59.480 --> 42:00.520

the greatest

42:00.560 --> 42:02.600
spectacle in racing.

(TYRES SCREECH)

42:03.880 --> 42:06.160
RICHARD: America's
most prestigious race

42:06.200 --> 42:08.520
would be a tough challenge.

42:08.560 --> 42:12.160
Oval racing at higher average
speeds than he was used to

42:12.200 --> 42:14.160
against seasoned
Indy veterans.

42:17.200 --> 42:18.880
For the Indy 500,

42:18.920 --> 42:20.640
Clark raced a specially
developed Lotus

42:20.680 --> 42:24.120
producing just shy
of 500 horsepower.

42:24.160 --> 42:26.600
However,
although he already had

42:26.640 --> 42:29.120
a Formula One
world title to his name,

42:29.160 --> 42:33.560
the Scotsman's CV
cut no ice with the sniffy
Indy officials

42:33.600 --> 42:36.520
who made the upstart
from across the pond

42:36.560 --> 42:39.920
take a rookie driving test
before he could compete.

Come Indy weekend,

42:45.400 --> 42:47.360
the upstart
from across the pond

42:47.400 --> 42:49.560
qualified on the front row.

42:51.040 --> 42:52.960
And then...

42:53.000 --> 42:56.160
in the race itself...

42:56.160 --> 43:00.000
Clark, up against
America's finest oval racers,

43:00.040 --> 43:03.760
won by just over two minutes.

43:07.800 --> 43:10.920
(CHEERING)

43:10.960 --> 43:15.040
REPORTER: Jim Clark,
first European to win
at Indianapolis since 1916,

43:15.080 --> 43:19.880
set a new record
of 150.686 miles per hour.

43:19.920 --> 43:23.640
RICHARD: So, what was it
that made Clark so good?

43:23.680 --> 43:28.840
What was it that made him
capable of winning
in any type of car?

43:30.440 --> 43:33.440
Jimmy was an absolute
natural driver,

43:33.480 --> 43:35.160
and he did it
without thinking.

43:35.160 --> 43:37.320
He didn't know
why he was driving

43:37.360 --> 43:39.360
in this style the way he did.

43:39.400 --> 43:41.320
(ROAR OF ENGINE)

43:43.320 --> 43:44.880
In the period
that we're talking about,

43:44.920 --> 43:48.240
we had one and a half-litre
cars, 200 horsepower.

43:48.280 --> 43:52.120
If you drove the car too hard
you would scrub the speed off

43:52.160 --> 43:55.080
and if you lose
a bit of speed,

43:55.120 --> 43:57.120
it's very difficult to
actually make it up again.

43:57.160 --> 43:58.760
And that's what Jimmy had,

43:58.800 --> 44:02.040
the knack of keeping the
momentum of the car going.

44:02.080 --> 44:04.960
I don't think that any
of the modern drivers

44:05.000 --> 44:09.960
could have driven the car
anywhere near as quickly
as Jimmy did,

44:10.000 --> 44:12.080
because he was
just so precise.

44:16.880 --> 44:22.000
RICHARD: Besides
a supernatural ability
to coax speed out of the car,

44:22.040 --> 44:25.920
Clark also possessed
another vital skill.

44:25.960 --> 44:27.880
A lot of
very good racing drivers

44:27.920 --> 44:29.920
died in Lotuses,

44:29.960 --> 44:33.920
because the Lotus
was a very fragile car.

44:33.960 --> 44:37.360
But Jim Clark was so smooth

44:37.400 --> 44:40.160
that he never put
too much stress

44:40.200 --> 44:43.240
on the areas of a car
that would give up.

44:43.280 --> 44:46.680
In Barcelona, in practice...

44:46.720 --> 44:48.520
he came in after ten laps.

44:48.560 --> 44:50.280
We'd done ten. He said,

44:50.320 --> 44:51.920
"There's something
on the left rear.

44:51.960 --> 44:53.720
Something, something.

44:53.760 --> 44:56.760
I can feel something
on the left rear.
It's...it's not right."

44:56.800 --> 44:59.000
We looked over,
we checked everything.

44:59.040 --> 45:00.800
Everything felt good.

45:00.840 --> 45:02.640
He said, "No, there's
something wrong."

45:02.680 --> 45:08.200
So, that night
I took the left rear
suspension to pieces,

45:08.240 --> 45:10.880
and lo and behold
one of the wheel bearings

45:10.920 --> 45:14.320
has just started to wear.

45:14.360 --> 45:18.080
I don't know how anybody
could ever feel that.
But he did.

45:18.120 --> 45:21.280
BILLY COWE:
After the race, when you
stripped his car down,

45:21.320 --> 45:24.520
and you stripped
his co-driver's car down,

45:24.560 --> 45:26.360
you could always tell
which parts

45:26.400 --> 45:28.080
came off Jimmy's car

45:28.120 --> 45:29.360
and which parts came off

45:29.400 --> 45:30.960
the other driver's car.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.880
Because the parts
off Jimmy's car

45:33.920 --> 45:35.840
were more or less pristine.

45:37.640 --> 45:39.560
RICHARD:
But don't think for a minute

45:39.600 --> 45:41.400
that Clark
was one of those drivers

45:41.440 --> 45:44.400
that could only win
in a perfect car.

45:46.200 --> 45:48.560
One year at Spa, for example,

45:48.600 --> 45:52.280
he was leading the race
when his gearbox
started to let go.

45:54.560 --> 45:56.560
Did he give up? Nope.

45:56.600 --> 45:58.600
Instead, he drove
the rest of the race,

45:58.640 --> 46:02.680
and we're talking 160 miles
an hour in the wet...

46:02.720 --> 46:04.560
with one hand
on the steering wheel

46:04.600 --> 46:07.680
and the other holding
the gear lever in place.

46:13.960 --> 46:15.320
And he still won.

46:17.960 --> 46:20.040
By nearly five minutes.

46:36.480 --> 46:39.720
As the 1965 season rolled on,

46:39.760 --> 46:42.960
Clark, having won both
Formula Two championships,

46:43.000 --> 46:45.800
the Tasman Series,

46:45.840 --> 46:47.720
and the Indy 500,

46:47.760 --> 46:51.840
now faced
one remaining challenge.

46:51.880 --> 46:55.280
The biggest challenge,
the Formula One world title.

46:55.320 --> 46:57.280
(ROAR OF ENGINE)

47:00.000 --> 47:02.520
For the F1 races,
Clark would be driving

47:02.560 --> 47:05.360
a modified version
of the Lotus 25 -

47:05.400 --> 47:07.000
the car that had taken him

47:07.040 --> 47:09.400
to the World Championship
two years earlier.

47:11.920 --> 47:15.200
But as amazing as the 25 was,

47:15.240 --> 47:17.160
there was no
getting round the fact

47:17.200 --> 47:21.800
that by 1965 it was
a three-year-old design,

47:21.840 --> 47:25.760
and the updated version
only had minor changes.

47:25.800 --> 47:27.360
So how would Jim cope?

47:31.320 --> 47:34.840
At the season's
opening race in South Africa,

47:34.880 --> 47:36.320
up against such legends

47:36.360 --> 47:38.680
as Jack Brabham, Graham Hill,

47:38.720 --> 47:42.920
and reigning World Champion
John Surtees...

47:42.960 --> 47:46.120
Clark won
by half a minute,

47:46.160 --> 47:50.200
and did so while suffering
from a slipped disc.

47:52.080 --> 47:54.200
Next up was Spa,

47:54.240 --> 47:56.680
and then
the French Grand Prix:

47:56.720 --> 48:01.040
both of which he also won.

48:01.080 --> 48:03.840
REPORTER: His Lotus may be
a car with an old engine,

48:03.880 --> 48:05.600
but as far as the
opposition are concerned,

48:05.640 --> 48:08.680
it is just
out-distancing all.

48:08.720 --> 48:12.000
RICHARD: Behind
the wheel, Clark was
becoming untouchable.

48:14.920 --> 48:17.640
Jimmy would go out
beginning of
the practice session

48:17.680 --> 48:20.520
and do
a very, very quick lap.

48:20.560 --> 48:22.640
And come back,
sit on the wall.

48:22.680 --> 48:25.280
You know, there's no point
in wearing the car out.

48:25.320 --> 48:27.920
And then wait and see
what everybody else has done,

48:27.960 --> 48:29.280
and go out and blitz it.

48:31.640 --> 48:33.240
If he wasn't
on pole position,

48:33.280 --> 48:35.400
there was a problem
with the car.

48:35.440 --> 48:37.240
RICHARD:
Next up was Silverstone.

48:37.280 --> 48:40.520
And here, it looked like
business as usual

48:40.560 --> 48:43.880
with Clark
leading the pack.

48:43.920 --> 48:46.800
However,
in the closing stages,

48:46.840 --> 48:50.120
his engine was starting
to lose oil pressure

48:50.160 --> 48:54.440
and was in danger
of detonating
under cornering G-forces.

48:54.480 --> 48:57.600
COMMENTATOR: While
Clark is driving with no
oil pressure on his gauge,

48:57.640 --> 48:59.440
Hill, storming up behind,
breaks the lap record

48:59.480 --> 49:01.000
in his efforts to pass.

49:01.040 --> 49:04.000
So instead of driving the car
through the corner

49:04.040 --> 49:06.880
he just switched it off,
coasted through the corner.

49:06.920 --> 49:09.400
When he was through
the corner, switched it
back on again,

49:09.440 --> 49:12.000
did the rest of the lap -
and he won the race.

49:15.400 --> 49:18.040
RICHARD:
Eventually, the F1 circus

49:18.080 --> 49:19.720
arrived at the Nurburgring,

49:19.760 --> 49:23.000
a circuit where Clark
had never won.

49:23.040 --> 49:25.560
REPORTER: For the
Flying Scot, tense moments
before the start.

49:25.600 --> 49:27.000
Victory in
the German Grand Prix

49:27.040 --> 49:28.880
and he'd be World Champion.

49:28.920 --> 49:30.840
(ENGINES REV AND ROAR)

49:35.880 --> 49:37.360
RICHARD:
Leading from pole,

49:37.400 --> 49:40.840
Clark finally broke
his Nurburgring jinx,

49:40.880 --> 49:42.800
winning the race,
and with it

49:42.840 --> 49:45.640
the Formula One
world title.

49:46.960 --> 49:48.480
(APPLAUSE)

49:55.240 --> 49:59.360
So, let's just sum up
Clark's season of 1965.

49:59.400 --> 50:01.800
Of the 63 races he contested,

50:01.840 --> 50:04.600
he won
a staggering 31 of them,

50:04.640 --> 50:07.600
and was on the podium
a further eight times.

50:07.640 --> 50:11.120
He was now seen as
the greatest racing driver
of all time,

50:11.160 --> 50:13.600
in demand the world over.

50:13.640 --> 50:15.520
Yet this shy Scotsman

50:15.560 --> 50:17.880
chose to mark
the year's achievements

50:17.920 --> 50:21.200
with a modest celebration
at his hometown

50:21.240 --> 50:23.160
back in Scotland.

50:28.480 --> 50:30.000
(SOUNDTRACK OVER SPEECH)

50:34.680 --> 50:39.400
The next two years by
contrast were a disaster,

50:39.440 --> 50:41.840
with multiple
mechanical failures

50:41.880 --> 50:43.800
denying him
another championship.

50:51.320 --> 50:54.200
However, in 1968,

50:54.240 --> 50:56.080
driving the Lotus 49,

50:56.120 --> 50:58.680
another game-changer
from Colin Chapman,

50:58.720 --> 51:03.200
Clark took the first win of
the year in South Africa

51:03.240 --> 51:06.880
and looked set for
another dominant season.

51:06.920 --> 51:09.680
Congratulations, Jim,
this was an absolutely
splendid effort.

51:09.720 --> 51:11.000
OK, thank you very much.

51:11.040 --> 51:13.840
And then, on the weekend
of April the 7th,

51:13.880 --> 51:17.000
Clark had a choice of two
races he could compete in,

51:17.040 --> 51:18.440
one at Brands Hatch,

51:18.480 --> 51:21.720
the other a Formula Two race
at Hockenheim.

51:21.760 --> 51:24.720
Fatefully, he entered
the German race.

51:30.920 --> 51:33.680
April the 7th is a...
is a bad day for me.

51:33.720 --> 51:35.600
He wasn't happy.

51:35.640 --> 51:39.280
It was freezing cold
and damp... misty.

51:39.320 --> 51:42.960
We could not get any heat
into the tyres.

51:43.000 --> 51:46.760
Couldn't get
any temperature in them
no matter what we did.

51:46.800 --> 51:48.240
Jimmy said to me
before the race:

51:48.280 --> 51:50.280
"Do not expect
anything from me today.

51:50.320 --> 51:55.280
Just keep me informed with
the pit board where I am,
how many laps to go."

51:57.760 --> 51:59.720
That's the last thing
he said.

52:02.800 --> 52:04.720
(ENGINES REVVING)

52:11.720 --> 52:16.640
RICHARD: On lap five,
Clark's car suddenly
speared off the track

52:16.680 --> 52:19.160
at 170 miles an hour.

52:23.360 --> 52:26.480
I got to the scene,
and they took me through
the undergrowth to this...

52:26.520 --> 52:29.920
There's no Armco.
There's Tarmac, trees.

52:29.960 --> 52:31.200
Literally.

52:31.240 --> 52:32.920
And the sheer path.

52:32.960 --> 52:36.120
And I just saw
what was left of a car... Oh.

52:39.640 --> 52:41.520
There was nothing to see.

52:41.560 --> 52:44.080
I said, "Where's the engine
gearbox? What's going on?

52:44.120 --> 52:46.320
What's happened?"
They said, "That's..."

52:46.360 --> 52:50.520
It was about 35 yards away
through the saplings.

52:50.560 --> 52:52.680
It just cut
the saplings down.

52:52.720 --> 52:56.040
And I said, "Where's, where's
the driver? Where's Jimmy?"
They said, "No."

52:58.640 --> 53:01.560
When you've just... lost...

53:02.800 --> 53:04.560
the best driver
in the world,

53:04.600 --> 53:06.880
what the hell do you do?

53:08.040 --> 53:10.120
Jim Clark, he's a god.

53:10.160 --> 53:12.480
And the first time I saw him,
my God, it's...

53:12.520 --> 53:15.320
I can't believe it.
And you're actually
talking to him.

53:15.360 --> 53:17.720
It was awe-inspiring.

53:17.760 --> 53:20.280
Life is worth living.

53:22.960 --> 53:25.360
It's...

53:25.400 --> 53:27.560
for me, it's tearful.

53:29.280 --> 53:31.240
I'm sorry.

53:35.120 --> 53:37.520
RICHARD: According
to the medical report,

53:37.560 --> 53:40.720
Clark died instantly
of a broken neck

53:40.760 --> 53:45.080
and the crash was later
put down to a deflating tyre.

53:45.120 --> 53:48.840
When he died, he was just 32.

53:48.880 --> 53:54.320
But in his short career
he had racked up some truly
incredible achievements.

53:56.000 --> 54:00.120
In Formula One,
he won 25 of his 73 races,

54:00.160 --> 54:04.040
which in percentage terms
puts him way ahead of
Hamilton, Vettel,

54:04.080 --> 54:05.440
and even Schumacher.

54:05.480 --> 54:07.560
In pole positions, he had 33.

54:07.600 --> 54:09.160
Which again,
in percentage terms,

54:09.200 --> 54:11.680
makes him
second best of all time,

54:11.720 --> 54:14.080
just behind Fangio.

54:14.120 --> 54:15.600
Then there are
the Grand Slams:

54:15.640 --> 54:19.240
that's where a driver gets
pole position, fastest lap,

54:19.280 --> 54:22.640
the win and leads
every lap of the race.

54:22.680 --> 54:25.640
Schumacher has five
Grand Slams to his name.

54:25.680 --> 54:27.280
Senna, four.

54:27.320 --> 54:29.760
Jim Clark, eight.

54:29.800 --> 54:32.480
That's more than
any other driver in history.

54:34.920 --> 54:38.000
You might imagine
that a man with such skills

54:38.040 --> 54:40.840
would be rated highly
by other drivers.

54:40.880 --> 54:43.440
And you'd be right.

54:43.480 --> 54:46.440
I was invited to
a cocktail party for Fangio,

54:46.480 --> 54:49.880
and he said to me,
"In my opinion,

54:49.920 --> 54:53.160
Jimmy Clark was the
greatest racing driver ever."

54:53.200 --> 54:55.240
And coming from Fangio,

54:55.280 --> 54:58.400
there's no better
compliment than that.

54:58.440 --> 55:00.560
And the five-time
World Champion

55:00.600 --> 55:02.760
was not the only
South American

55:02.800 --> 55:04.720
who idolised the Scotsman.

55:06.680 --> 55:08.880
At Clark's old school
in Edinburgh,

55:08.920 --> 55:12.800
there's a plaque
commemorating
his achievements.

55:12.840 --> 55:16.520
And in 1991,
the reigning World Champion

55:16.560 --> 55:19.360
made a special pilgrimage
to the school

55:19.400 --> 55:23.160
to pay his respects.

55:23.200 --> 55:27.520
Of Clark, Senna said simply,
"He was my boyhood hero.

55:27.560 --> 55:30.880
He was the best of the best."

55:30.920 --> 55:34.200
And like Senna, Clark died
when he was driving

55:34.240 --> 55:36.840
at his absolute peak.

55:36.880 --> 55:39.880
Like Senna, who knows
how many more races

55:39.920 --> 55:42.680
and championships
he could have racked up?

55:48.200 --> 55:53.040
He was the benchmark.
That was it.

55:53.080 --> 55:57.440
Most of what I was able to do
in motor racing was done...

55:57.480 --> 56:00.280
by the manner in
which Jim Clark drove,

56:00.320 --> 56:02.160
and... I just followed him.

56:03.680 --> 56:05.400
BILLY COWE:
He was a gentleman.

56:05.440 --> 56:09.320
He was a gentleman,
and a gentle man .

56:09.360 --> 56:11.200
It's a pity he's not
around now, because...

56:13.520 --> 56:15.160
it'd be nice to have him.

56:23.600 --> 56:25.920
RICHARD: He was
an amazing man.

56:25.960 --> 56:28.960
-Just incredible.
-All of that's amazing.

56:29.000 --> 56:30.480
Yeah.

56:30.520 --> 56:32.280
What I find truly amazing

56:32.320 --> 56:35.080
is how many championships
he took part in.

56:35.120 --> 56:37.920
I mean, can you imagine
Lewis Hamilton

56:37.960 --> 56:39.720
getting out of his
Formula One car and saying,

56:39.760 --> 56:41.120
"I haven't got time
for any interviews,

56:41.160 --> 56:42.920
cos I've got to go and
do a touring car race."

56:42.960 --> 56:44.640
-Just wouldn't.
-And he did.

56:44.680 --> 56:46.880
The other thing worth
remembering is back
in the early '60s,

56:46.920 --> 56:50.680
if you went to Australia,
if you flew to Australia
that meant eight stops.

56:50.720 --> 56:53.480
And there were no flat beds.
There weren't even
any movies.

56:53.520 --> 56:56.680
And let's not forget
he'd get off that aeroplane,

56:56.720 --> 56:58.640
do a race, win it -
obviously,

56:58.680 --> 57:00.880
then get on another aeroplane
straight away to France

57:00.920 --> 57:03.880
-to win a race there.
-No, it is astonishing.

57:03.920 --> 57:05.880
I mean, everybody has
a favourite racing driver.

57:05.920 --> 57:07.960
I'm sure everybody here
does as well.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.320
It's, you know, it's the
Senna, Schumacher,

57:10.360 --> 57:12.280
Villeneuve,
Romain Grosjean...

57:12.320 --> 57:14.600
-(LAUGHTER)
-...Fangio.

57:14.640 --> 57:18.280
But if you use maths to
measure a driver's greatness,

57:18.320 --> 57:22.240
you have to conclude
it was Jim Clark.

57:22.280 --> 57:24.240
-Good night.
-(MOUTHS)
