04:03.821 --> 04:04.999
Hello, Carol.

06:03.173 --> 06:06.559
Oh, my God, Skyler.

06:07.593 --> 06:08.760
Okay, I'll take the pink one.

06:08.811 --> 06:10.378
- It's a princess cupcake.
- Ooh.

06:10.396 --> 06:11.813
- Skyler?
- I know, right?

06:11.847 --> 06:14.399
Well, actually,
they were my idea,

06:14.433 --> 06:15.900
so you are all welcome.

06:15.935 --> 06:17.402
You are the devil.

06:19.721 --> 06:22.407
Hey, buddy.
Ready for a cold one?

06:22.441 --> 06:25.693
Nah. I'm not feeling
hundred percent.

06:25.727 --> 06:27.495
- Oh, no.
- I hope it's not something you ate.

06:27.530 --> 06:29.364
No, no, I just...

06:29.398 --> 06:31.499
We have Pepto, Uncle Hank.

06:31.534 --> 06:33.067
Yeah.

06:33.085 --> 06:34.085
Uh, no, I'm good.

06:34.120 --> 06:36.204
I-I-I...
We need to shove off.

06:36.238 --> 06:38.006
Okay, yeah.
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

06:38.040 --> 06:40.375
I'm sorry, Skyler.
I hate to leave you with...

06:40.409 --> 06:42.594
No, no, don't worry about it.
I have plenty of help.

06:42.628 --> 06:45.430
- And by that, she means me.
- That is correct.

06:45.464 --> 06:48.016
- Holly can help.
- Let's go say good-bye.

06:48.050 --> 06:49.917
Let's go send them
on their way.

06:49.935 --> 06:51.919
- Let's say good-bye.
- Yes.

06:51.937 --> 06:53.921
- Too long.
- Mwah. Say, "Bye, Auntie."

06:53.939 --> 06:55.723
Bye, sweetie. Bye-bye.

06:55.757 --> 06:58.977
Hey, and you know it's been about a
hundred years since we've been bowling.

06:59.028 --> 07:01.429
- Well, then, how about Thursday night?
- Oh, that sounds great.

07:01.447 --> 07:03.764
Oh, thank you for having us.

07:03.782 --> 07:06.767
Hey. You okay to drive?

07:06.785 --> 07:09.120
Yeah.

07:09.155 --> 07:12.373
All right.
Well, feel better.

07:14.944 --> 07:16.995
Say, "Bye, Uncle Hank."
Bye-bye.

07:18.998 --> 07:20.916
Bye-bye.

07:20.950 --> 07:22.385
Bye, Aunt Marie.
Can you wave bye?

07:22.419 --> 07:24.730
All right, let's get started
on those dishes. Come on.

07:25.588 --> 07:28.491
- You.
- No, you. - You. Washing, okay?

07:29.025 --> 07:32.060
- I'll dry. You wash.
- Hello, Carol.

07:32.094 --> 07:35.313
Oh, hi, Walt.

07:35.347 --> 07:37.849
Europe.
I can't believe it.

07:37.900 --> 07:41.319
- Were you there when she said that?
- Yeah.

07:41.353 --> 07:43.488
You okay?
Your stomach okay?

07:43.522 --> 07:44.805
Yeah, oh, yeah.
I'm fine.

07:44.823 --> 07:49.744
Okay.
God. Jesus, Europe.

07:49.778 --> 07:52.447
I just... And, you know,
where they were

07:52.481 --> 07:54.315
three or four months ago.

07:54.333 --> 07:55.983
Oh, she was talking about it.

07:56.001 --> 07:58.002
It sounds like it's...

07:58.037 --> 07:59.537
We need to go to Europe.

07:59.588 --> 08:01.039
- We could go.
- Yeah.

08:01.090 --> 08:03.758
It'd have to be, like,
a business trip, you know.

08:03.792 --> 08:05.793
It could, um...
We could go to Italy.

08:05.827 --> 08:08.179
To, um, Lake Como.

08:08.214 --> 08:09.597
It's "Como," right?

08:09.632 --> 08:11.332
...Like Mario Cuomo?

08:20.008 --> 08:22.644
Hank. Hank?

08:22.678 --> 08:23.678
Hank?

08:23.696 --> 08:25.980
Baby, you okay?

08:26.014 --> 08:27.649
Hank!

08:31.954 --> 08:34.188
Oh, my God.
Hank!

08:34.206 --> 08:38.243
Hank! Hank! Oh, my God!

08:38.294 --> 08:41.696
Hank, are you...

08:41.714 --> 08:43.914
- Are you okay? Are you okay?
- I'm good.

08:43.966 --> 08:47.585
Call an ambulance!
Call an ambulance!

08:47.636 --> 08:50.588
Okay. You okay?
Just take a breath.

08:50.639 --> 08:52.423
Oh, God, sweetheart.

08:52.474 --> 08:53.891
It was an accident.
It happens.

08:53.926 --> 08:56.427
I'll make the appointment.
All you have to do is show up.

08:56.478 --> 08:59.714
For what? Three hours
in the Emergency Room?

08:59.732 --> 09:00.898
All for nothing?

09:00.933 --> 09:03.067
All they did was rule out
a heart attack.

09:03.102 --> 09:05.486
- What if it happens again?
- It's not gonna happen again.

09:05.521 --> 09:08.773
How can you know that? You can't even
say what it was in the first place.

09:08.824 --> 09:10.241
Marie, baby, I'm okay.

09:10.276 --> 09:13.861
I'm fine. Trust me.
Discussion over.

09:13.895 --> 09:16.531
- And do not tell Skyler.
- What? Why?

09:16.565 --> 09:18.700
Just don't.

09:18.734 --> 09:21.119
There's nothing to be
embarrassed about. Hank?

10:23.932 --> 10:26.067
<i>Hola,</i> Mariano.

10:26.101 --> 10:27.101
Morning.

10:27.135 --> 10:29.136
Luis. Enrique.

10:29.154 --> 10:31.072
Oh, <i>feliz cumpleaños,</i> Enrique.

10:31.106 --> 10:35.660
Hi.

10:38.864 --> 10:39.864
Here you go.

10:39.915 --> 10:41.982
There's complimentary
coffee inside.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.669
Have an A-1 day.

10:44.703 --> 10:46.871
Air fresheners
are high margin, right?

10:46.922 --> 10:48.956
At 30 cents wholesale, yeah.

10:48.990 --> 10:52.009
Right. So I'm thinking
we reorganize the display,

10:52.044 --> 10:54.345
separate the food scents
from the nature scents.

10:54.380 --> 10:58.933
I mean, does bubble gum belong
anywhere near ocean spray? No.

10:58.967 --> 11:01.636
And pine is still
our biggest seller, right?

11:01.670 --> 11:04.522
So maybe we move that
over to the cash register

11:04.556 --> 11:07.007
by the five-hour
energy drink.

11:07.025 --> 11:08.526
Sure. Fine.

11:08.560 --> 11:12.647
Yeah, yeah.
Come here.

11:12.681 --> 11:15.516
Speaking of the business,

11:15.534 --> 11:17.819
the story comes first.

11:17.853 --> 11:20.238
The story is is that
we are car wash owners,

11:20.289 --> 11:21.572
pure and simple.

11:21.623 --> 11:25.243
But if our story is that
the car wash is successful,

11:25.294 --> 11:28.529
what do successful
car wash owners do?

11:28.547 --> 11:31.699
They buy more car washes.

11:33.001 --> 11:36.170
Listen. Skyler.

11:36.204 --> 11:38.890
We'll be laundering
that money for years.

11:38.924 --> 11:40.892
Decades.

11:40.926 --> 11:43.895
Wouldn't two
be better than one?

11:45.514 --> 11:47.932
Well, there's gentle hands
over by Kirtland.

11:47.983 --> 11:50.017
I do love that location.

11:52.654 --> 11:54.439
I'll think about it.

11:54.490 --> 11:56.157
Yeah. Right. Right.

11:56.191 --> 11:58.443
To be continued.

11:58.494 --> 11:59.660
Okay.

12:02.831 --> 12:04.832
Good morning.
Welcome to A-1.

12:04.867 --> 12:06.951
Just the regular, please.

12:07.002 --> 12:09.737
Well, we're having a special
on hand wax... 21.99...

12:09.755 --> 12:12.840
if you're interested in getting
rid of those water spots.

12:12.875 --> 12:14.542
Just the regular is fine.

12:14.576 --> 12:18.412
Okay. Well, there's complimentary
coffee inside while you're waiting.

12:18.430 --> 12:20.765
Have an A-1 day.

12:25.604 --> 12:27.472
Please give this to
your car wash professional,

12:27.523 --> 12:29.774
and have an A-1 day.

12:34.279 --> 12:37.264
68%. And falling.

12:37.282 --> 12:39.317
Good morning. May I have
your ticket, please?

12:39.368 --> 12:43.204
I knew there would be
a drop in quality, but 68%?

12:43.238 --> 12:47.107
This is not what I agreed to.

12:47.125 --> 12:49.794
I left a viable operation.

12:49.828 --> 12:51.796
The rest was up to you.

12:51.830 --> 12:53.798
May I have your ticket, please?

12:53.832 --> 12:55.883
I'm only asking for a few days.

12:55.918 --> 12:58.469
A week at most.
Call it a tutorial.

12:58.504 --> 13:00.621
That's the standard wash.

13:00.639 --> 13:03.975
Fix this.
Get the ship back on course.

13:04.009 --> 13:06.978
We'll make it worth your while.

13:07.012 --> 13:10.481
That'll be 14.95, please.

13:12.100 --> 13:14.769
Listen, this is
a complicated situation.

13:14.803 --> 13:17.021
There are a lot
of moving parts.

13:17.072 --> 13:20.575
None of which are my concern.

13:21.660 --> 13:24.529
You're putting me
in a box here.

13:24.580 --> 13:26.747
You know what could happen.

13:28.667 --> 13:31.536
Again, none of my concern.

13:31.587 --> 13:33.170
There's your change.

13:33.205 --> 13:35.456
And if you'll hand this
to your car wash professional.

13:35.490 --> 13:37.491
And have an A-1 day.

13:43.015 --> 13:45.600
- Listen...
- It'll only be a few more minutes.

13:45.634 --> 13:48.168
There's some complimentary
coffee, if you like.

14:01.483 --> 14:03.534
What's up?

14:03.569 --> 14:06.370
Just wondering
who washes a rental car.

14:09.658 --> 14:12.376
Walt, who was that?

14:15.831 --> 14:18.749
She's a former
business associate

14:18.800 --> 14:20.918
who wants me to go back.

14:21.569 --> 14:23.904
And I won't.

14:38.620 --> 14:41.622
Enrique, this one's finished.

14:41.656 --> 14:44.208
<i>Terminado. Gracias.</i>

14:44.259 --> 14:47.544
Get out of here.
Now.

14:48.546 --> 14:51.682
- Excuse me?
- Never come back here.

14:51.716 --> 14:54.301
Do you understand me?

14:54.335 --> 14:56.887
- I...
- Go.

15:18.578 --> 15:20.579
Hey.
Hey.

15:22.032 --> 15:24.116
Oh, thanks.

15:24.167 --> 15:26.068
Are you going in today?

15:26.086 --> 15:28.871
- Uh, no. Uh-uh.
- Good.

15:28.905 --> 15:31.257
Just, you ow, stay out of there
till you're sure you're better.

15:31.291 --> 15:32.758
- Yeah.
- Stay home and rest.

15:32.792 --> 15:34.760
- Don't even think about work.
- Okay.

15:34.794 --> 15:37.379
- All right. I'll see you later.
- Bye-bye.

15:52.262 --> 15:53.979
- Morning, Mrs. Schrader.
- Hey, guys.

15:54.030 --> 15:56.315
- What's going on?
- Just dropping these off, ma'am.

15:56.366 --> 15:58.867
- Where would you like them?
- Bring them around to the garage, guys.

15:58.902 --> 16:02.204
I got it.
Have a good day.

16:03.573 --> 16:05.607
You too.

16:06.876 --> 16:08.777
Boss, Janice said to tell you

16:08.795 --> 16:11.046
a few of them
might not have indexes.

16:11.081 --> 16:12.880
We could give you a hand
sorting through them.

16:12.980 --> 16:14.500
No, I got it. Thanks.

16:16.953 --> 16:18.804
All right.

16:20.974 --> 16:21.851
- See you, boss.
- Okay.

16:22.385 --> 16:25.079
Okay, um...

17:04.520 --> 17:05.854
<i>" Your world is in flames "</i>

17:06.688 --> 17:08.355
<i>" there ain't even a name "</i>

17:08.388 --> 17:10.107

<i>" but the name
that she's calling "</i>

17:17.565 --> 17:19.616
<i>" is not your name she calls "</i>

18:22.380 --> 18:24.698
Dude, you are tripping.

18:24.716 --> 18:28.168
I'm not dead. I'm on
the starship <i>Enterprise,</i>

18:28.202 --> 18:31.922
macking on Yeoman Rand, while the
Andorian with the Disrupter's

18:31.973 --> 18:34.224
back on Talos Four or whatever.

18:34.259 --> 18:36.727
What do you think
all those sparkles and shit are?

18:36.728 --> 18:38.728
The transporters are breaking
you apart, man.

18:38.897 --> 18:40.981
Down to your molecules
and bones.

18:41.016 --> 18:42.599
They're making a copy.

18:42.651 --> 18:45.102
That dude who comes out on the
other side, he's not you.

18:45.153 --> 18:46.987
He's a Color Xerox.

18:47.022 --> 18:49.573
So you're telling me every time
Kirk went into the transport,

18:49.607 --> 18:51.442
he was killing himself?

18:51.493 --> 18:55.395
So over the whole series,
there was, like, 147 Kirks?

18:55.413 --> 18:57.164
At least.

18:57.198 --> 19:01.234
Dude, yo, why do you think McCoy
never likes to beam nowhere?

19:01.252 --> 19:03.236
'Cause he's a doctor, bitch.

19:03.254 --> 19:05.906
Look it up.
It's science.

19:07.909 --> 19:10.010
I ever tell you about
my <i>Star Trek</i> script?

19:10.045 --> 19:11.912
<i>Star Trek</i> script?

19:11.930 --> 19:14.348
Yeah. I gotta
write it down is all.

19:14.382 --> 19:19.753
The <i>Enterprise</i>
is five parsecs out of Rigel 12.

19:19.771 --> 19:22.940
Nothing's going on,
Neutral Zone is quiet,

19:22.974 --> 19:24.558
the crew is bored,

19:24.592 --> 19:27.027
so they put on
a pie-eating contest.

19:27.062 --> 19:29.841
The whole crew's in the galley.
They're eating tulaberry pies...

19:29.941 --> 19:30.614
Tulaberry?

19:30.648 --> 19:32.866
Tulaberries.
From Gamma Quadrant, yo.

19:32.901 --> 19:34.601
That's <i>Voyager,</i> dude.

19:34.619 --> 19:37.788
Okay, blueberries then.
They're eating blueberry pies

19:37.822 --> 19:41.291
as fast as the replicator
can churn them out.

19:43.912 --> 19:45.879
Finally,
it's down to just three...

19:45.914 --> 19:48.382
Kirk, Spock, and Chekov.

19:48.416 --> 19:50.634
Okay, Spock always wins
these things.

19:50.668 --> 19:53.220
How is Spock
gonna beat Kirk, yo?

19:53.254 --> 19:55.889
Spock's like a toothbrush.
Look at Kirk. He's got room to spare.

19:55.924 --> 19:59.626
Spock has total vulcan control
over his digestion.

19:59.644 --> 20:01.795
- You wanna hear this or not?
- Yeah, yeah, go.

20:01.813 --> 20:05.232
Okay, finally, Kirk...
he can't take it anymore.

20:05.266 --> 20:09.302
He yorks. Now it's just
down to Chekov and Spock.

20:09.320 --> 20:10.988
But Chekov, you see,

20:11.022 --> 20:15.242
he's got a whole fat stack
of Quatloos riding on this,

20:15.276 --> 20:18.245
and he has figured out
a way to win.

20:18.279 --> 20:20.531
He's got Scotty back
in the transporter room,

20:20.582 --> 20:22.533
locked in on Chekov's stomach.

20:22.584 --> 20:25.652
Every time Chekov eats a pie,
Scotty beams it right out of him.

20:25.670 --> 20:27.254
Where is he sending them?
The toilet?

20:27.288 --> 20:28.872
Space.

20:28.923 --> 20:31.175
There's blueberries
just floating out there,

20:31.209 --> 20:33.377
frozen, because it's in space,

20:33.428 --> 20:36.764
and Chekov is just
shoveling them into his mouth,

20:36.798 --> 20:39.933
and Spock's like, "I can't believe
this Russian is defeating me."

20:39.968 --> 20:43.837
Meanwhile, Scotty's in the transporter
room fiddling with levers,

20:43.855 --> 20:46.006
when Lieutenant Uhura comes in,

20:46.024 --> 20:48.525
and she's got, you know,
her big pointies.

20:48.560 --> 20:51.528
- And Scotty's fingers are all sweaty.
- No.

20:51.563 --> 20:55.682
Chekov screams. He sprays
blood out of his mouth.

20:55.700 --> 20:58.735
Scotty beamed his guts
into space!

20:58.787 --> 21:02.022
No way!

21:02.040 --> 21:05.225
Hey, man, where you going?
You're missing the best part.

21:05.260 --> 21:07.211
Just fill this out.
Bring it back to me.

21:26.598 --> 21:27.764
Yo.

21:29.767 --> 21:32.402
Yo!

21:37.558 --> 21:39.392
Ohhh.

22:07.555 --> 22:10.524
You know you can't
smoke that up in here.

22:16.564 --> 22:20.868
Yeah. Jesse Pinkman's
out here smoking pot.

22:20.902 --> 22:23.103
Give me a break, man.

22:27.775 --> 22:30.610
Pinkman, he'll see you now.

22:30.628 --> 22:33.947
Woody Harrelson,
live and in person.

22:33.965 --> 22:35.949
Pull up a bong and take a seat.

22:35.967 --> 22:38.468
Hey, I'm kidding about the bong.
Don't be doing that.

22:38.503 --> 22:40.787
Uh, sorry to keep you
on ice out there, kid.

22:40.805 --> 22:43.290
If I'd known it was you,
well...

22:43.308 --> 22:45.509
Francesca.
I've warned her before.

22:45.560 --> 22:48.845
One more time,
and it's back to the DMV.

22:48.897 --> 22:53.466
So, uh,
are we on our own today?

22:53.484 --> 22:55.135
Barn door open.

22:55.153 --> 22:57.637
"Barn door"?

22:57.655 --> 22:58.989
Oh.

22:59.023 --> 23:01.491
So, uh, how is the maestro?

23:01.526 --> 23:03.493
Things have been quiet
on this end.

23:03.528 --> 23:05.195
I haven't seen him.

23:05.246 --> 23:08.148
Just as well, probably.

23:08.166 --> 23:10.650
That whole thing
in the jails...

23:10.668 --> 23:12.452
I mean, when they start
to whack the lawyers,

23:12.486 --> 23:13.921
that's when I draw the line.

23:13.955 --> 23:18.342
This goes to
Kaylee Ehrmantraut,

23:18.376 --> 23:24.298
and that goes
to Mr. and Mrs. Albert Sharp.

23:24.332 --> 23:28.468
315 East Pueblo.
It's up in White Horse.

23:28.502 --> 23:30.687
It's two and a half million each.

23:30.722 --> 23:33.190
A total of five.

23:34.776 --> 23:36.727
Mr. and Mrs., uh, who?

23:36.778 --> 23:39.279
Drew Sharp's parents.

23:39.314 --> 23:42.783
Drew Sharp... that's the kid on TV.
The missing, uh...

23:42.817 --> 23:46.153
So but why would you, uh...
Scratch that.

23:46.187 --> 23:48.038
I don't know,
and I don't wanna know.

23:48.072 --> 23:51.742
Uh, thing is,
what those folks want

23:51.793 --> 23:53.410
is to know what happened
to their boy.

23:53.461 --> 23:55.245
Sack full of cash
on their doorstep...

23:55.296 --> 23:57.748
that's just gonna
raise more questions.

23:57.799 --> 24:01.718
Kaylee Ehrmantraut.
That's Mike's granddaughter?

24:01.753 --> 24:05.205
- So this is Mike's money?
- It's mine.

24:05.223 --> 24:07.207
It's your money.
Okay.

24:07.225 --> 24:10.002
And you're giving it
to Kaylee Ehrmantraut...

24:10.003 --> 24:11.960
It's what Mike wanted.

24:14.432 --> 24:16.650
So you and Mike, uh...

24:16.684 --> 24:18.718
You've been in touch?

24:23.775 --> 24:26.743
So we're just
talking about charity?

24:26.778 --> 24:28.912
Yeah.

24:28.946 --> 24:31.281
Okay, look.
You know, um,

24:31.332 --> 24:34.951
shelling out money to the ex
and her little boy... I kinda get it.

24:35.003 --> 24:37.170
I mean, kinda. But this...

24:37.205 --> 24:38.672
This is a bridge too far.

24:38.706 --> 24:40.374
I'm sorry to say, kid,

24:40.408 --> 24:44.244
but you're still gonna be
two miracles short of sainthood.

24:47.515 --> 24:50.350
Brass tacks, okay?
My job is to advise.

24:50.385 --> 24:54.221
And my advice is...
Come on, already.

24:54.255 --> 24:56.473
Mike left one step ahead
of the boys in blue,

24:56.524 --> 24:58.725
and you better believe
his family's on the radar.

24:58.759 --> 25:00.310
A couple million bucks
shows up,

25:00.361 --> 25:02.312
they're gonna snatch it
<i>tout de suite.</i>

25:02.363 --> 25:04.398
The feds have already taken
Kaylee's money twice.

25:04.432 --> 25:06.599
What are you
you going for a hat trick?

25:06.617 --> 25:08.902
- I'll freaking do it myself, Saul.
- No, no, no!

25:08.936 --> 25:10.487
I was just...
I was thinking out loud.

25:10.538 --> 25:12.989
Enough bullshit, Saul.
Are you gonna do this or not?

25:13.041 --> 25:16.410
Yes, yes, absolutely.
I... I live to serve.

25:19.547 --> 25:21.882
And, kid, you might
wanna think about

25:21.916 --> 25:23.834
cleaning up a little,
getting some rest.

25:23.885 --> 25:26.286
- You've looked better.
- Just get it done.

25:33.627 --> 25:37.230
You know who this is?
Don't hang up on me.

25:38.983 --> 25:40.633
Yeah, there's a problem.

25:40.651 --> 25:43.470
There's five million of them
here in my office.

25:43.488 --> 25:47.524
No. No. Don't.
Just hold onto it.

25:49.243 --> 25:52.312
Yes. Ye...

25:52.330 --> 25:54.114
Yes.

25:54.148 --> 25:56.149
Calm down.

25:58.002 --> 25:59.786
I'll handle it.

26:58.785 --> 27:01.220
Déjá vu, huh?

27:02.956 --> 27:04.924
Jesus.

27:04.958 --> 27:06.976
All right, look.

27:07.978 --> 27:10.513
You wanna talk me through this?

27:10.564 --> 27:12.898
What you were thinking?

27:15.068 --> 27:18.487
What you asked Saul to do?
I mean, come on.

27:18.522 --> 27:20.856
It's just nonsensical.

27:30.450 --> 27:32.451
I mean, do you...

27:33.453 --> 27:35.588
You have any explanation
at all?

27:39.492 --> 27:41.160
What?

27:42.462 --> 27:44.880
It's like you said.
It's...

27:44.931 --> 27:47.049
It's blood money.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.768
I s...

27:51.021 --> 27:53.723
Jeez. Okay. Yes. All right.

27:53.774 --> 27:57.226
I said that. I did.

27:58.895 --> 28:01.447
But it was in...
in the heat of the moment.

28:01.481 --> 28:04.450
I was trying to win
an argument, all right?

28:04.484 --> 28:08.371
And I was wrong.

28:08.405 --> 28:10.573
This is your money.

28:10.624 --> 28:12.958
Come on.
You've earned it.

28:34.214 --> 28:35.881
Drew Sharp.

28:37.567 --> 28:40.569
That is a terrible memory,
no doubt about it.

28:43.690 --> 28:45.691
But, son...

28:46.777 --> 28:49.395
you need to stop focusing

28:49.413 --> 28:52.164
on the darkness behind you.

28:52.199 --> 28:54.533
The past is the past.

28:59.206 --> 29:02.208
Nothing can change
what we've done.

29:03.960 --> 29:06.178
But now that's over.

29:07.464 --> 29:10.099
You're out,

29:10.133 --> 29:12.301
and so am I.

29:15.055 --> 29:17.773
That's right.
I'm done.

29:19.559 --> 29:22.611
I've been out
for about a month.

29:25.031 --> 29:28.150
And there is nothing left
for us to do

29:28.201 --> 29:32.988
except to try to live...

29:34.825 --> 29:37.076
ordinary, decent lives.

29:52.726 --> 29:55.060
Why Kaylee Ehrmantraut?

29:58.482 --> 30:00.983
She needs someone
looking after her.

30:04.986 --> 30:07.137
Mike is perfectly capable

30:07.155 --> 30:09.857
of looking after
his own granddaughter.

30:12.193 --> 30:14.978
I don't think so.

30:14.996 --> 30:17.948
I don't think he is capable.

30:17.982 --> 30:21.201
I don't think he's coming back.

30:21.252 --> 30:23.587
What...
what are you saying?

30:25.957 --> 30:28.509
You doing what you did...

30:28.543 --> 30:31.211
offing Mike's guys?

30:32.213 --> 30:34.214
If he was out there,

30:34.265 --> 30:37.267
you would have to look over your
shoulder for the rest of your life,

30:37.302 --> 30:39.269
and that's not
how you do things.

30:39.304 --> 30:41.271
So I think he's dead,

30:41.306 --> 30:44.892
and I think you know that.

30:47.195 --> 30:49.730
I don't know that.

30:52.683 --> 30:54.368
I don't.

30:56.120 --> 30:58.572
Listen to me.

30:58.623 --> 31:01.825
I did not kill Mike.

31:03.044 --> 31:05.362
The last time that I saw him,

31:05.380 --> 31:08.131
he had his bag...
the one that I brought him...

31:08.166 --> 31:10.467
and he got into his car,
and he drove away.

31:10.502 --> 31:13.170
And for all I know,
he is alive and well.

31:16.140 --> 31:20.093
And if... and if
he does come back,

31:20.144 --> 31:23.764
and he doesn't understand
why I had to do what I did...

31:25.316 --> 31:27.818
well, then, that's on me.

31:31.656 --> 31:33.941
Jesse...

31:35.827 --> 31:38.946
I need you to believe this.

31:42.584 --> 31:45.836
It's not true.
It's just not.

31:48.122 --> 31:52.709
So he's out there.
He's okay.

31:52.743 --> 31:54.578
Yes.

31:54.596 --> 31:56.680
Mike is fine.

31:56.714 --> 31:59.182
Wherever he is.

31:59.217 --> 32:02.936
We both know that
he can take care of himself.

32:04.138 --> 32:06.106
And he's certainly capable

32:06.140 --> 32:09.142
to provide for
his own family, okay?

32:12.597 --> 32:14.448
Jesse?

32:16.150 --> 32:18.702
I need you to believe me.

32:23.107 --> 32:26.743
Yeah. Like you said.

32:27.745 --> 32:29.746
He's alive.

32:32.250 --> 32:33.950
Yeah.

32:35.753 --> 32:37.888
Mike's alive.

32:44.345 --> 32:46.463
Absolutely.

32:54.022 --> 32:55.939
Well, you've gotta
have a college counselor.

32:55.973 --> 32:57.407
Are they bringing in
someone new?

32:57.442 --> 32:58.975
I don't know.

32:58.993 --> 33:00.694
Um, maybe she'll be back.

33:00.745 --> 33:02.913
And what if she's not?
What are you supposed to do?

33:02.947 --> 33:05.115
I mean, what's Louis gonna do?

33:05.149 --> 33:07.784
- He's... he's not worried.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

33:07.818 --> 33:10.671
What's there to worry about?
It's only college, right?

33:10.705 --> 33:12.339
Right.

33:12.373 --> 33:14.758
College.
Nothing more important.

33:14.792 --> 33:17.327
Oh. You know, Uncle Hank's
still not feeling well,

33:17.345 --> 33:19.963
so bowling's off
tomorrow night.

33:19.997 --> 33:21.298
Really?

33:21.332 --> 33:24.801
Really. So you're spared
a night out with the family.

33:24.835 --> 33:27.054
You do not have to look
so happy about it.

33:27.105 --> 33:29.056
I'll be right back.

33:29.107 --> 33:30.941
Um...

33:32.310 --> 33:34.561
so if bowling's off,

33:34.612 --> 33:38.565
can I...
can I get a late curfew?

33:47.158 --> 33:50.460
Ah. Ugh.

34:55.359 --> 34:57.978
Are you gonna
turn off the light?

34:58.029 --> 35:00.363
Have you seen <i>Leaves Of Grass?</i>

35:00.398 --> 35:02.282
Hmm?

35:02.316 --> 35:04.701
My book.
Walt Whitman.

35:04.736 --> 35:06.620
Dark green hardcover?

35:06.654 --> 35:09.072
I didn't even know we had that.

35:10.293 --> 35:12.094
Hmm.

35:17.417 --> 35:19.969
You don't think Junior...

35:20.020 --> 35:22.021
You're kidding, right?

35:23.023 --> 35:26.308
Well, it'll show up.

35:43.710 --> 35:45.711
What's wrong with Hank?

35:45.745 --> 35:49.882
Mm, it's a stomach bug,
sounds like.

35:50.884 --> 35:53.085
He hasn't been to work
all week.

35:56.139 --> 35:58.974
Well, good night.

36:00.927 --> 36:02.724
Good night.

38:10.852 --> 38:13.053
Mister, can you help me out?

38:13.105 --> 38:15.389
Spare so change?

38:26.518 --> 38:29.353
Hey. Come back.

38:29.371 --> 38:31.872
Yeah. You. Come here.

38:31.907 --> 38:33.908
I got something for you.

38:39.464 --> 38:40.748
Here.

38:40.799 --> 38:42.583
Take it.

38:42.634 --> 38:44.301
Go ahead.

38:46.221 --> 38:48.422
Just take it.

38:50.976 --> 38:52.476
Take it.

38:55.313 --> 38:58.315
Yeah.

39:36.754 --> 39:38.922
Anything you
want us to tell Steve Gomez?

39:38.940 --> 39:40.608
He says he's worried about you.

39:40.642 --> 39:43.310
Yeah. Tell him
I already got two grandmas.

39:45.197 --> 39:48.983
Listen, tell everybody
more work and less worry.

39:51.936 --> 39:54.104
- We better hit it.
- Yeah.

39:54.122 --> 39:56.407
See ya.

40:15.343 --> 40:17.678
- Hey, guys.
- Walt.

40:17.729 --> 40:19.847
- How are you? Good to see you.
- How you doing?

40:19.898 --> 40:22.633
Very good. Yeah. Well, you know.
I can't complain.

40:22.651 --> 40:25.236
Hey, how's your son's arm, by the way?
I was thinking about that.

40:25.270 --> 40:27.154
It's back to 100%.
We're going to District.

40:27.188 --> 40:29.189
It's gonna be exciting.
When? This Saturday?

40:29.241 --> 40:32.359
This Saturday morning. I think
first pitch is at 10:00 AM, so, uh...

40:32.410 --> 40:33.694
- 10:00.
- Yeah.

40:33.745 --> 40:35.362
Be there.
Should be a big crowd.

40:35.413 --> 40:37.781
Guys, you're still on the clock here!
Let's go!

40:37.815 --> 40:38.949
See you, Walt.

40:38.983 --> 40:40.284
- See you, Artie.
- See you, Walt.

40:40.318 --> 40:41.818
All right, Scott.
Be well.

40:46.041 --> 40:48.325
They're good guys, huh?

40:48.343 --> 40:49.927
Yeah.

40:49.961 --> 40:52.713
Well, it's good to see you up and about.
- Yeah.

40:52.764 --> 40:54.965
- How you feeling?
- Well, you know,

40:54.999 --> 40:58.535
I've been better, but...
I don't know.

40:58.770 --> 41:01.271
You...
Did you get to see a doctor?

41:01.322 --> 41:02.940
I mean,
when one of these things

41:02.991 --> 41:04.408
lasts more than three days

41:04.442 --> 41:06.159
you really should
get that checked.

41:06.194 --> 41:08.161
Yeah, no, I...
I did and I'm fine.

41:08.196 --> 41:11.064
I'm, uh... I'm what they say
on the upswing, you know?

41:11.082 --> 41:13.784
Mm. Good.
Good to hear.

41:13.835 --> 41:15.786
Yeah.

41:15.837 --> 41:18.789
When I heard you weren't
going in to work, I...

41:18.840 --> 41:23.460
Well, looks like you have
the work coming to you.

41:23.511 --> 41:26.079
Perks of being the boss, huh?

41:26.097 --> 41:28.131
Yeah, you know...

41:31.019 --> 41:34.087
How's, uh...
how's things at the car wash?

41:34.105 --> 41:36.139
- Good.
- Yeah?

41:36.190 --> 41:38.108
Yeah, really good.

41:40.361 --> 41:42.980
Hey, did you have
any of that potato salad?

41:45.099 --> 41:46.817
- I don't know. Ma... maybe.
- Yeah, I mean,

41:46.868 --> 41:50.571
no one else got sick, so you
probably shouldn't worry about it.

41:54.909 --> 41:57.995
Well, Skyler will be very happy to
hear that you're feeling better.

41:58.046 --> 41:59.463
Which reminds me.

41:59.497 --> 42:01.548
I better get back to it.

42:04.619 --> 42:08.121
If there's anything I can do...

42:13.645 --> 42:16.129
Feel better.

42:27.942 --> 42:29.910
You know...

42:31.279 --> 42:32.913
You're gonna laugh,

42:32.947 --> 42:36.199
but I have to ask you
about this.

42:37.368 --> 42:40.671
Believe it or not,
I found this on my car.

42:40.705 --> 42:42.873
I mean, it looks just like
the GPS tracker

42:42.924 --> 42:45.125
that we used on Gus Fring,
doesn't it?

42:46.327 --> 42:49.046
Back when we were tracking him,
just the two of us?

42:51.099 --> 42:54.101
You wouldn't know anything
about this, would you, Hank?

43:10.318 --> 43:13.036
You okay?

43:13.071 --> 43:16.740
I gotta say, I don't like the way
you're looking at me right now.

43:22.580 --> 43:25.248
Ugh!

43:30.638 --> 43:32.539
- Hank...
- It was you.

43:32.557 --> 43:35.392
All along, it was you!

43:35.426 --> 43:37.678
You son of a bitch.

43:37.712 --> 43:40.347
You drove into traffic
to keep me from that laundry.

43:40.381 --> 43:42.482
Calm down.

43:42.517 --> 43:45.602
That call I got telling me
Marie was in the hospital...

43:45.653 --> 43:48.221
that wasn't Pinkman.

43:48.239 --> 43:50.223
You had my cell number.

43:50.241 --> 43:53.944
You killed ten witnesses
to save your sorry ass.

43:53.995 --> 43:57.564
- Listen to me...
- You bombed a nursing home.

43:57.582 --> 44:01.034
Heisenberg. Heisenberg!

44:01.068 --> 44:03.870
You lying,
two-faced sack of shit.

44:03.904 --> 44:05.872
Hank, look,

44:05.906 --> 44:08.408
I don't know where this is
coming from, Hank, but just...

44:08.426 --> 44:12.429
I swear to Christ,
I will put you under the jail.

44:12.463 --> 44:14.681
Just take a breath, okay?
Just listen to yourself.

44:14.716 --> 44:17.517
These wild accusations...
they could destroy our family.

44:17.552 --> 44:20.353
- And for what?
- Damn, like you give a shit about family!

44:26.944 --> 44:29.446
Hank, my cancer is back.

44:30.448 --> 44:32.783
Good.

44:32.817 --> 44:35.118
Rot, you son of a bitch.

44:36.154 --> 44:38.155
I'm sorry you feel that way.

44:39.540 --> 44:41.908
I wanna beat this thing.
I do.

44:41.942 --> 44:45.545
I'm back on chemo,
and I am fighting like hell.

44:47.548 --> 44:49.800
But the truth is in six months,

44:49.834 --> 44:53.503
you won't have
someone to prosecute.

44:55.339 --> 44:57.257
But even...

44:57.291 --> 45:00.060
even if somehow

45:00.094 --> 45:03.764
you were able
to convince anyone

45:03.798 --> 45:06.516
I was capable
of doing these things,

45:06.567 --> 45:09.402
you and I both know

45:09.437 --> 45:12.439
I would never see
the inside of a jail cell.

45:17.478 --> 45:21.748
I'm a dying man
who runs a car wash.

45:21.783 --> 45:26.036
My right hand to God,
that is all that I am.

45:31.092 --> 45:33.627
What's the point?

45:37.832 --> 45:41.218
Have Skyler
bring the kids here,

45:41.269 --> 45:43.770
and then we'll talk.

45:47.441 --> 45:50.844
That is not going to happen.

45:55.983 --> 45:58.485
I don't know who you are.

46:00.488 --> 46:03.490
I don't even know
who I'm talking to.

46:07.211 --> 46:10.413
If that's true,

46:10.464 --> 46:14.033
if you don't know who I am...

46:15.920 --> 46:20.390
then maybe your best course...

46:22.393 --> 46:25.428
would be to tread lightly.
