00:01.576 --> 00:04.637
- Chapter 18:
Tom had a secret.

00:04.737 --> 00:06.838
And it was a fact of life
in the Hayworth family,

00:06.938 --> 00:09.420
Tom was not good
at keeping secrets.

00:10.780 --> 00:12.361
- Oh, my God,
is she hallucinating?

00:12.461 --> 00:13.521
- No, it's a parasitic twin

00:13.621 --> 00:14.422
that lives in the back
of her head.

00:14.502 --> 00:15.842
- Tom!
- Sorry.

00:15.942 --> 00:17.443
- What happened
to my leftover noodles?

00:17.543 --> 00:18.724
- Denise and I ate them.

00:18.824 --> 00:20.004
- Tom!
- Sorry.

00:20.104 --> 00:22.005
- Oh, I don't need
a children's menu.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.206
- Sarah just got
her first period.

00:23.306 --> 00:24.807
- Tom!
- Sorry.

00:24.907 --> 00:26.447
- And now,
he'd just seen his brother

00:26.547 --> 00:29.809
hooking up with
his sister's wife's sister.

00:29.909 --> 00:31.910
Oh, my God.

00:32.230 --> 00:33.571
Oh, my God.

00:33.671 --> 00:36.372
Tom was doing his best
to keep the secret to himself.

00:36.472 --> 00:37.973
I saw Connor and JoJo having...

00:38.073 --> 00:39.573
[stammers]

00:39.673 --> 00:40.894
Preparing for
sexual intercourse.

00:40.994 --> 00:42.815
- What?
How do you...

00:42.915 --> 00:44.616
preparing for
sexual intercourse?

00:44.716 --> 00:45.616
- Earlier
when I went by his place.

00:45.716 --> 00:46.736
They didn't see me.

00:46.836 --> 00:48.137
- And you're sure
that's what you saw?

00:48.237 --> 00:49.658
- I don't know, maybe they're

00:49.758 --> 00:52.219
putting each other's
clothes on,

00:52.319 --> 00:54.300
doing a really bad job
on account of all the...

00:54.400 --> 00:56.141
French kissing.
- [sighs]

00:56.241 --> 00:58.942
Denise's sister
and your brother?

00:59.042 --> 01:00.823
Well, I guess
now that you know,

01:00.923 --> 01:02.304
it won't stay
a secret for long.

01:02.404 --> 01:05.545
- Come on, I waited
almost 24 hours to tell you.

01:05.645 --> 01:07.586
- I was asleep for
a lot of that, doesn't count.

01:07.686 --> 01:08.786
- Hmm.

01:08.886 --> 01:10.427
- And now,
I'm going back to bed.

01:10.527 --> 01:11.948
- How can you sleep
knowing this?

01:12.048 --> 01:13.308
- Like a baby.

01:13.408 --> 01:15.790
Sleep is the only place
where I get to be alone.

01:15.890 --> 01:17.470
- Yeah, but come on,
it's a lot to take in.

01:17.570 --> 01:19.191
I mean, should I
tell Connor that I know?

01:19.291 --> 01:20.392
- [snoring]
- Should I--

01:20.492 --> 01:21.992
- [snoring]

01:22.092 --> 01:23.353
- Oh, my--how does she do that?

01:23.453 --> 01:28.115
[upbeat music]

01:28.215 --> 01:30.956
- Look at them, they might as
well just take off their pants

01:31.056 --> 01:32.877
and do it right there
on the scones.

01:32.977 --> 01:34.358
- Wow, so blatant.

01:34.458 --> 01:35.839
You have to talk to Connor.

01:35.939 --> 01:37.399
I mean, what they do
is their business,

01:37.499 --> 01:39.400
but I hate keeping a secret
from Denise.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.961
- I know.
Denise tried to talk to me

01:41.061 --> 01:42.762
earlier and I had to pretend
there was a bee in my eye.

01:42.862 --> 01:46.083
You can't pretend a bee,
Marina, it's obvious.

01:46.183 --> 01:47.124
- What's obvious?

01:47.224 --> 01:48.965
- Coffee...

01:49.065 --> 01:50.926
is so obvious, right?

01:51.026 --> 01:53.026
[chuckles]

01:54.467 --> 01:57.609
Oh, my God, is it...
is that bee in here again?

01:57.709 --> 01:58.809
Oh, not again.

01:58.909 --> 02:00.970
- Okay, you can never
commit a crime.

02:01.070 --> 02:03.851
- Hey, Marina, what's it been
like working back at the firm?

02:03.951 --> 02:06.373
- Well, it's not
how I plan on going back

02:06.473 --> 02:08.373
but since the whole
SofÃ­a memoir thing happened,

02:08.473 --> 02:09.854
we needed
a little bit more income.

02:09.954 --> 02:11.615
- Well, I hope
that you still have time

02:11.715 --> 02:13.656
to plan our first
Condor Girls overnight.

02:13.756 --> 02:16.137
- Please, I stole
highlighters at work.

02:16.237 --> 02:17.738
[gasps and laughter]
- I can't wait.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.659
Our first
Condor Girls camp out.

02:19.759 --> 02:21.139
all: Caw-caw!

02:21.239 --> 02:22.860
- Well, the campsite is
gonna be in our living room

02:22.960 --> 02:23.940
'cause it's January.

02:24.040 --> 02:25.301
Caw-caw?

02:25.401 --> 02:27.502
- Now, the theme
is female friendship,

02:27.602 --> 02:30.263
so come prepared with your
favorite sisterhood-themed song

02:30.363 --> 02:33.825
or poem or pair of jeans
that magically fits everybody.

02:33.925 --> 02:35.386
Caw-caw!
all: Caw-caw!

02:35.486 --> 02:38.187
- And while the girl cousins
are doing Condor Girl stuff,

02:38.287 --> 02:40.828
Kelvin, Tom, and I
are gonna do some man stuff.

02:40.928 --> 02:43.049
Video games, pizza, beer.

02:44.610 --> 02:46.831
Tom can handle one beer.
- Light beer.

02:46.931 --> 02:48.111
- Bam.

02:48.211 --> 02:49.832
- Well, Denise,
looks like that leaves us.

02:49.932 --> 02:51.033
What do you say
to a sister night?

02:51.133 --> 02:53.474
- Yes, finally.
I've hardly seen you.

02:53.574 --> 02:55.715
You're always doing night yoga
or sleeping all day

02:55.815 --> 02:57.075
'cause you're tired
from that night yoga.

02:57.175 --> 02:58.236
- Mm-hmm.
[laughs]

02:58.336 --> 03:00.077
- Night yoga?
- Yeah.

03:00.177 --> 03:01.838
It's yoga but you do it
in the middle of the night.

03:01.938 --> 03:05.479
- Oh, yes,
I've also heard of this trend.

03:05.579 --> 03:06.800
- I want to try that.
- No, you don't.

03:06.900 --> 03:08.901
- Okay.

03:10.782 --> 03:13.043
- Hey, come here. Come here.

03:13.143 --> 03:14.924
- You okay?

03:15.024 --> 03:17.084
Look a little paler than usual.
Are you sweating?

03:17.184 --> 03:18.165
- Yeah, sweating?

03:18.265 --> 03:20.346
Kind of like
I'm doing some night yoga?

03:21.627 --> 03:22.887
- It's a real thing.
- Oh, come on.

03:22.987 --> 03:24.288
I saw you and JoJo.

03:24.388 --> 03:25.888
The other day I came over here
to return my watch

03:25.988 --> 03:28.290
and saw you guys all...

03:28.390 --> 03:30.851
kissy, kissy.
- Oh, my God.

03:30.951 --> 03:33.252
- When did this start?
- Christmas.

03:33.352 --> 03:34.813
- When the whole family
was here?

03:34.913 --> 03:37.094
- No, we waited till you guys
were in the driveway.

03:37.194 --> 03:39.194
Look, at first it was just...

03:40.395 --> 03:43.096
Kissy, kissy but then
it turned into something real.

03:43.196 --> 03:44.457
- Oh, okay, well,
if it's so real,

03:44.557 --> 03:45.397
then when are you gonna
tell Denise about it?

03:45.477 --> 03:47.658
- Maybe next week?

03:47.758 --> 03:49.499
Maybe never.
- Connor, come on.

03:49.599 --> 03:50.980
You can't keep
a thing like this a secret.

03:51.080 --> 03:52.821
More importantly, I can't.

03:52.921 --> 03:55.242
- I just need more time, okay?
I mean, look at them.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.104
When JoJo first got here,
her and Denise

03:59.204 --> 04:00.384
could hardly stand each other.

04:00.484 --> 04:01.705
Now, they're getting along
better than ever.

04:01.805 --> 04:03.546
I don't want to mess that up.
- We're heading out.

04:03.646 --> 04:04.706
- Thanks for coming.

04:04.806 --> 04:06.187
- Thank you.
Everything was delicious.

04:06.287 --> 04:07.948
I should get home and rest up
for midnight pilates.

04:08.048 --> 04:10.189
I hope I get
the mean instructor tonight.

04:10.289 --> 04:12.109
- Ooh, yeah,
I heard he's rough.

04:12.209 --> 04:14.410
- Yeah, you guys might actually
be worse at this than me.

04:16.411 --> 04:18.112
- I brought so much
sick camping gear

04:18.212 --> 04:19.433
for the little Condor Girls.

04:19.533 --> 04:21.434
I got sub-zero sleeping bags,

04:21.534 --> 04:24.435
titanium hiking poles,
bear alarms.

04:24.535 --> 04:26.036
- I brought graham crackers.

04:26.136 --> 04:27.957
- Great,
something we'll actually use.

04:28.057 --> 04:30.118
Can you drop that off
in the kitchen?

04:30.218 --> 04:31.838
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.479
You need to tell her.

04:33.579 --> 04:35.240
- No, I do not.

04:35.340 --> 04:38.001
- Listen, unlike Tom,
I can keep a secret.

04:38.101 --> 04:39.442
I just don't want to.

04:39.542 --> 04:41.002
- Look, I have an idea.

04:41.102 --> 04:42.683
You're scared to tell Denise

04:42.783 --> 04:44.044
because you know how
she's going to react, right?

04:44.144 --> 04:45.525
- Yeah.
- Well, what if I could

04:45.625 --> 04:47.565
set the table?

04:47.665 --> 04:49.206
- What?

04:49.306 --> 04:50.447
- Set the table.
- I know, I heard you.

04:50.547 --> 04:51.567
What table? What do you mean?
- Set...

04:51.667 --> 04:52.768
just, you know, trust me.

04:52.868 --> 04:54.088
- Okay, have fun
with the girls tonight.

04:54.188 --> 04:55.529
- Thanks.
- JoJo and I

04:55.629 --> 04:57.330
are going to watch
a dating show that she likes

04:57.430 --> 04:59.411
where no one can have sex--

04:59.511 --> 05:01.212
or everyone has to have sex,
I can't remember.

05:01.312 --> 05:04.373
- [laughs]
That's funny, Denise.

05:04.473 --> 05:06.934
Connor loves those shows, too.

05:07.034 --> 05:08.295
- Do I?
- Yeah.

05:08.395 --> 05:09.976
You do,
and when you think about it,

05:10.076 --> 05:11.416
you and JoJo
have a lot in common, you know?

05:11.516 --> 05:14.217
It's like,
they both like travel, fitness.

05:14.317 --> 05:16.579
Whoa, I just had
an insane idea.

05:16.679 --> 05:18.820
This is, like--this is insane.

05:18.920 --> 05:20.300
What if we got
those two together?

05:20.400 --> 05:22.381
- Whoa, Tom.
[laughs]

05:22.481 --> 05:25.303
That is--I've never even
considered that.

05:25.403 --> 05:28.784
I mean, Denise, what do
you think of this crazy idea?

05:28.884 --> 05:31.585
- Uh, yeah, that would
be insane, literally.

05:31.685 --> 05:33.426
- You think?
- I mean, Connor,

05:33.526 --> 05:36.027
you've been dating
like a shark lately.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.588
Like, if you stop moving
through women, you'll die.

05:37.688 --> 05:39.549
- That's a bit
of an overstatement.

05:39.649 --> 05:42.230
- And anyone who dates JoJo
is left in shambles.

05:42.330 --> 05:44.351
She's like a tornado
and if you combine those two

05:44.451 --> 05:47.352
you get a sharknado--
a love sharknado.

05:47.452 --> 05:49.033
I mean, it would be a mess--

05:49.133 --> 05:50.794
not just for them,
but for all of us.

05:50.894 --> 05:54.076
It would end in tears and
fighting and choosing sides,

05:54.176 --> 05:55.316
and then next thing you know,

05:55.416 --> 05:56.677
we're having
three different Christmases.

05:56.777 --> 05:59.158
But good idea, Tom.
[laughter]

05:59.258 --> 06:00.138
All right,
bye for real this time.

06:00.218 --> 06:01.119
- Okay.
- Bye.

06:01.219 --> 06:03.760
- Okay, then.
[door closes]

06:03.860 --> 06:06.321
What the hell, Tom?
Now I can never tell her.

06:06.421 --> 06:08.322
- I'm sorry, I was trying
to set the table.

06:08.422 --> 06:09.683
- With what, grenades?

06:09.783 --> 06:11.483
- Now Denise is going
to be all in my head.

06:11.583 --> 06:13.284
- What do you mean?
- I mean, she tends to be right

06:13.384 --> 06:14.885
about, like, everything.

06:14.985 --> 06:16.486
I mean, think about it.
She had me pegged.

06:16.586 --> 06:18.567
I'm always comparing myself
to a shark.

06:18.667 --> 06:20.367
I don't want my relationship
to blow up this family.

06:20.467 --> 06:21.848
I kind of like this family,
Tom!

06:21.948 --> 06:24.129
- Relax. Denise just needs
to get used to the idea.

06:24.229 --> 06:26.050
It's kind of like Sarah
when she first met Marina.

06:26.150 --> 06:27.851
both: Yeah.

06:27.951 --> 06:30.212
- Wait, what?
What does that mean?

06:30.312 --> 06:33.013
- Uh...
- I'm gonna take off.

06:33.113 --> 06:35.934
- Okay, I kind of misspoke.

06:36.034 --> 06:37.335
- Did Sarah not like me?

06:37.435 --> 06:39.016
- No, it wasn't that
she didn't like you.

06:39.116 --> 06:40.977
It was more
of a gradual warming,

06:41.077 --> 06:42.738
like the Earth.

06:42.838 --> 06:45.939
- I can't believe it.
- But hey, she likes you now.

06:46.039 --> 06:49.080
Right? Right?

06:51.241 --> 06:52.182
Oh, no.

06:52.282 --> 06:54.363
[doorbell rings]

06:55.443 --> 06:57.444
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:58.725 --> 07:00.225
I thought we could squeeze in
a little night yoga

07:00.325 --> 07:01.506
in the late afternoon.

07:01.606 --> 07:03.227
- Sure.

07:03.327 --> 07:07.029
Um, don't you have to get back
for sister night though?

07:07.129 --> 07:09.990
Won't Denise, maybe,
get a little suspicious?

07:10.090 --> 07:12.711
- Actually, I've been thinking.

07:12.811 --> 07:14.792
Denise and I are
in a good place now.

07:14.892 --> 07:16.433
Maybe we should tell her?

07:16.533 --> 07:18.534
Who knows, she might
even be happy for us.

07:19.294 --> 07:21.295
- Or she might not.
I bet not.

07:22.696 --> 07:24.156
- What do you mean?
- I just--

07:24.256 --> 07:25.717
I don't think
Denise has a great

07:25.817 --> 07:27.438
opinion on my dating life.

07:27.538 --> 07:29.879
She thinks I've been
kind of going through women.

07:29.979 --> 07:31.520
- Mm, doesn't bother me.

07:31.620 --> 07:34.881
I've been in plenty
of failed relationships, too.

07:34.981 --> 07:38.043
- Yeah, so do you worry
that maybe we're one of those

07:38.143 --> 07:41.484
love sharknados?
- [laughs] What?

07:41.584 --> 07:44.726
- A tornado shark combo,
but in relationship form.

07:44.826 --> 07:46.526
- Okay, what is your deal?

07:46.626 --> 07:48.287
You're calling me a shark?
- No.

07:48.387 --> 07:52.089
No, you'd be the tornado.
- Thank you?

07:52.189 --> 07:53.850
- Let's say things
get bad between us.

07:53.950 --> 07:56.531
I don't want to make it weird
between you and Denise

07:56.631 --> 07:58.852
or me and Denise
or you and Sarah

07:58.952 --> 08:00.293
because Sarah's married
to Denise.

08:00.393 --> 08:03.294
- Yeah, yeah, no.
I'm aware of all of this.

08:03.394 --> 08:05.775
Connor, this is crazy.
We just started dating.

08:05.875 --> 08:07.536
- I know, I'm just worried

08:07.636 --> 08:09.957
what's going to happen
when we stop.

08:11.438 --> 08:13.439
- Yeah.
- I...

08:14.239 --> 08:16.340
- I'm gonna call that
a red flag.

08:16.440 --> 08:17.901
- [sighs]
- You know what?

08:18.001 --> 08:20.002
This whole thing was a mistake.

08:22.883 --> 08:24.103
[whistle blows]

08:24.203 --> 08:26.985
- All right,
welcome to the sisterhood.

08:27.085 --> 08:29.906
Caw-caw!
all: Caw-caw!

08:30.006 --> 08:33.107
- Okay, everybody throw on
your sister hoodies, huh.

08:33.207 --> 08:34.668
And remember
what tonight is about.

08:34.768 --> 08:37.189
It is all about girls
always supporting girls.

08:37.289 --> 08:39.150
- [scoffs]

08:39.250 --> 08:42.392
- So, um, if everyone wants
to get unpacked and settle in

08:42.492 --> 08:43.392
and we'll start activities.

08:43.492 --> 08:45.433
both: Yay.

08:45.533 --> 08:47.514
- What? What was that?

08:47.614 --> 08:49.075
- Oh, nothing.

08:49.175 --> 08:50.876
I was just remembering
the first time we met.

08:50.976 --> 08:52.836
Do you remember?
- Of course.

08:52.936 --> 08:54.837
Yeah, we went
to that restaurant.

08:54.937 --> 08:56.318
It was so fun.
And I said to Tom,

08:56.418 --> 08:58.079
I said, "Tom, this new
girlfriend, she's a keeper."

08:58.179 --> 09:00.000
- Really?
- Really.

09:00.100 --> 09:02.121
- So you knew that we were
going to be friends right away?

09:02.221 --> 09:04.762
- Of course.
- Huh.

09:04.862 --> 09:08.123
- I mean, you know, not--
not right away, right away.

09:08.223 --> 09:09.244
- Speak on that.

09:09.344 --> 09:10.684
- You know,
we were so different.

09:10.784 --> 09:13.166
I really wanted to go to
that little vegetarian cafÃ©,

09:13.266 --> 09:17.007
and you insisted on the very
fancy white tablecloth place

09:17.107 --> 09:19.288
and paying for everything.
- Oh.

09:19.388 --> 09:21.649
Yeah, gosh,
what was I thinking?

09:21.749 --> 09:23.130
I guess
I was just really proud

09:23.230 --> 09:25.691
to be the first in my family
to go through college

09:25.791 --> 09:29.773
and then get through law school
and join a big law firm.

09:29.873 --> 09:31.374
So...
- Right, yes.

09:31.474 --> 09:33.955
And I love that about you.
It's amazing.

09:36.396 --> 09:38.397
Just talked a lot
about the expense account.

09:39.397 --> 09:40.658
- The expense account
that paid for

09:40.758 --> 09:42.759
all the food that
you were complaining about?

09:44.400 --> 09:46.181
- It was such a long--
it was so--

09:46.281 --> 09:48.542
- Such a long time ago.
- Such a long time ago.

09:48.642 --> 09:50.643
Good thing we're way past that.

09:51.883 --> 09:53.624
- Oh, boy.

09:53.724 --> 09:56.025
There is some drama going on
between mummy and Aunt Marina.

09:56.125 --> 09:58.626
- I am so glad
I'm not a Condor Girl.

09:58.726 --> 10:00.387
- Hey, Kel, are you ready
for guy's night?

10:00.487 --> 10:01.668
- I guess.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.348
- I cannot believe this.

10:03.448 --> 10:05.109
Marina just texted me
about what's going on.

10:05.209 --> 10:09.031
- Okay, what do you mean?

10:09.131 --> 10:10.271
- About the two of them.

10:10.371 --> 10:11.792
I mean, I guess
it's all out in the open now.

10:11.892 --> 10:14.193
- [sighs]
Denise, I just want you to know

10:14.293 --> 10:16.274
I feel terrible
about the whole thing.

10:16.374 --> 10:18.395
- Yeah, it's gonna get messy.
- Right?

10:18.495 --> 10:20.156
- But I don't want
to think about that right now.

10:20.256 --> 10:21.437
- I wish I could stop
thinking about it.

10:21.537 --> 10:23.557
Every time I close my eyes,
I see them kissing.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.078
I mean, of all the women
in the world,

10:25.178 --> 10:26.519
Connor's got to sleep
with your sister?

10:26.619 --> 10:27.479
What?
[chuckles]

10:27.579 --> 10:29.700
- Uh, what?

10:30.781 --> 10:31.721
- What?
- What?

10:31.821 --> 10:33.002
- What?
- What?

10:33.102 --> 10:34.642
- What were you talking about?

10:34.742 --> 10:36.363
- Marina finding out
that Sarah didn't like her

10:36.463 --> 10:37.724
when they first met,
but I'd like to focus on

10:37.824 --> 10:40.085
what you were talking about.
- Um...

10:40.185 --> 10:41.726
- Uncle Tom, you ready to go?
- You bet.

10:41.826 --> 10:43.166
- We're gonna need
a few minutes.

10:43.266 --> 10:45.267
- Yeah, we're actually
gonna need a few minutes.

10:47.308 --> 10:49.969
- Twins are asleep.
Who wants smores?

10:50.069 --> 10:52.290
- Oh, smores are at 8:00 p.m.

10:52.390 --> 10:54.131
Right now we're playing
Guess the Celebrity,

10:54.231 --> 10:55.412
but with women in STEM.

10:55.512 --> 10:57.933
- Do I wear glasses?
- I have no idea.

10:58.033 --> 10:59.814
- Am I dead?
- Kind of wish I was.

10:59.914 --> 11:01.215
- They're just warming up.

11:01.315 --> 11:02.155
I think they're really
gonna like it.

11:02.235 --> 11:03.976
- Of course you do.

11:04.076 --> 11:05.496
- Okay. Hey.

11:05.596 --> 11:07.337
Can we just sidebar
real quick?

11:07.437 --> 11:10.379
Uh, not to put my therapist cap
on, but it kind of feels like

11:10.479 --> 11:13.380
you're hanging on to some
resentments from before.

11:13.480 --> 11:15.821
- No, no resentment. No.

11:15.921 --> 11:18.822
When we met, I wasn't sure
we'd be friends either.

11:18.922 --> 11:20.623
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

11:20.723 --> 11:22.464
- Yeah, fine.
- [laughs]

11:22.564 --> 11:25.345
- Just curious, what about me
did you not immediately love?

11:25.445 --> 11:28.187
- Aww, um, I don't know.

11:28.287 --> 11:30.588
I guess I thought you were
a little inflexible.

11:30.688 --> 11:32.028
- Inflexible.
- Yeah.

11:32.128 --> 11:35.390
You know, like how a stick
is inflexible in the mud

11:35.490 --> 11:39.472
and it's just complaining about
how muddy the mud is.

11:39.572 --> 11:42.193
[laughter]

11:42.293 --> 11:44.074
- That's actually, that's
something that we have

11:44.174 --> 11:45.955
in common because
you complain a lot too.

11:46.055 --> 11:48.116
- Oh, do I now?
- Yeah, you sure do.

11:48.216 --> 11:50.077
Like, when you complain
about money

11:50.177 --> 11:52.118
in front of me and Denise
who have way less than you.

11:52.218 --> 11:54.359
I mean, look around, you have
a kitchen and a dining room

11:54.459 --> 11:55.999
and a living room
that aren't all the same room.

11:56.099 --> 11:57.520
- Well,
we also have three kids.

11:57.620 --> 11:59.041
- No one told you
to have three kids.

11:59.141 --> 12:01.362
- Learn how twins work.
- Are we gonna have smores?

12:01.462 --> 12:03.763
- [gasp] Of course, honey.
- What's a campsite

12:03.863 --> 12:05.524
without smores?
- Yes.

12:05.624 --> 12:06.884
Who's a stick
in the mud now, huh?

12:06.984 --> 12:08.165
- Sorry, I can't hear you.

12:08.265 --> 12:10.946
The acoustics are so bad
in my giant mansion.

12:12.707 --> 12:15.248
- [sighs]
I have had a day.

12:15.348 --> 12:17.329
I hope you have
a sister night box of wine.

12:17.429 --> 12:20.330
- Oh, sister night's
postponed indefinitely.

12:20.430 --> 12:22.691
I found out
about you and Connor.

12:22.791 --> 12:24.692
- Great. Here we go.

12:24.792 --> 12:27.213
- Dating my brother-in-law
without telling me?

12:27.313 --> 12:28.854
You didn't think
that was shady?

12:28.954 --> 12:29.895
- The last thing
I need right now

12:29.995 --> 12:31.775
is a lecture from Saint Denise.

12:31.875 --> 12:34.257
And we're not dating.
- Okay, hooking up or whatever.

12:34.357 --> 12:36.358
I don't read "Teen Vogue."
- No, we're done.

12:37.558 --> 12:38.779
He started acting all weird.

12:38.879 --> 12:40.740
We fought and then
we broke it off.

12:40.840 --> 12:42.100
- Hey, you lied to me.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.581
I thought
we turned a corner, JoJo.

12:44.681 --> 12:47.102
- I was gonna tell you.

12:47.202 --> 12:49.023
Just...

12:49.123 --> 12:51.705
felt like it was gonna
be different.

12:51.805 --> 12:53.145
I don't know what happened.

12:53.245 --> 12:55.026
I guess, I'm just too much
of a mess for him.

12:55.126 --> 12:56.907
- Too much of a mess
for Connor?

12:57.007 --> 12:58.548
- He said we were
destroying the family

12:58.648 --> 13:01.229
with a love sharknado?

13:01.329 --> 13:03.270
- A love sharknado?
He said that?

13:03.370 --> 13:06.271
- Yeah.

13:06.371 --> 13:09.032
- Okay, well, I'm gonna
go lay on your bed.

13:09.132 --> 13:11.353
- Okay, yeah.

13:11.453 --> 13:14.115
I'll bring you some tea.

13:14.215 --> 13:16.216
To be clear,
I'm still mad at you.

13:18.417 --> 13:19.917
[gunfire over TV speakers]

13:20.017 --> 13:22.238
- You win again.
Can I please go to bed now?

13:22.338 --> 13:23.679
- Come on, one more.
One more round.

13:23.779 --> 13:25.200
- Connor, it's getting late.

13:25.300 --> 13:27.881
- [sighs] Okay.
- Night, uncles.

13:27.981 --> 13:29.241
- Goodnight.
- Night.

13:29.341 --> 13:31.042
[gunfire continues]

13:31.142 --> 13:32.803
- You okay, man?
- Yup.

13:32.903 --> 13:37.645
I'm good, just pretending these
killer cyborgs are my feelings.

13:37.745 --> 13:39.086
- [sighs]
Look, man.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.327
I'm sorry about meddling
with you and JoJo.

13:41.427 --> 13:45.209
I screwed it up and
then I screwed it up again.

13:45.309 --> 13:47.690
And then I bought these chips
that no one liked.

13:47.790 --> 13:49.571
- Ah, it's not your fault.

13:49.671 --> 13:52.412
I mean, you did really
let us down with those chips,

13:52.512 --> 13:55.173
but I should've just
told Denise from the beginning.

13:55.273 --> 13:57.654
Maybe then I'd still
have a shot with JoJo.

13:57.754 --> 14:00.296
- Man, you--
you really like her, huh?

14:00.396 --> 14:02.216
- Yeah.

14:02.316 --> 14:05.938
Now I can't look at a shark or
a tornado without feeling sad.

14:06.038 --> 14:10.020
And that sucks because I used
to love both of those things.

14:10.120 --> 14:12.701
No, no, no.
Oh, come--lag, man.

14:12.801 --> 14:14.262
You see the lag?
- Yeah, no.

14:14.362 --> 14:16.623
This isn't misplaced anger.
- The lag.

14:16.723 --> 14:18.704
- Wow,
beautiful friendship bracelet.

14:18.804 --> 14:20.705
- Thanks, yours too.
- Thanks.

14:20.805 --> 14:22.806
- Mum, you're doing it wrong.

14:23.486 --> 14:25.907
- Well, this is
my first friendship bracelet.

14:26.007 --> 14:29.549
Okay, unlike Aunt Sarah,
I never went to Camp Caribou.

14:29.649 --> 14:31.510
My summer camp
was a fire hydrant

14:31.610 --> 14:33.230
in the middle of the street.
- Okay.

14:33.330 --> 14:34.711
Should we move on
to worksheets?

14:34.811 --> 14:36.072
- They're still
making bracelets.

14:36.172 --> 14:37.993
- But we have a schedule.
And after worksheets,

14:38.093 --> 14:39.913
we have She-rades.
- Is that--

14:40.013 --> 14:42.194
- Feminist charades, yeah.
- Okay, well.

14:42.294 --> 14:45.316
How about we just let the girls
do what they want to do?

14:45.416 --> 14:47.157
Smores?
- [gasps] Yes.

14:47.257 --> 14:50.918
- Or, or we could stick
to the sisterhood agenda.

14:51.018 --> 14:53.480
You know,
women supporting women?

14:53.580 --> 14:55.821
- Do you two need some space?

14:57.021 --> 14:59.202
- Okay,
here's a She-rade for you.

14:59.302 --> 15:00.403
- Mm-hmm.
- "Hi, my name is Sarah.

15:00.503 --> 15:02.043
"I have purple hair,

15:02.143 --> 15:05.205
and my personality
is a coexist bumper sticker."

15:05.305 --> 15:06.485
- Wow, well,
that's not a charade

15:06.585 --> 15:08.046
because you just
told me the answer.

15:08.146 --> 15:10.327
Fine, my turn.
"The other parents at the PTA

15:10.427 --> 15:12.208
are literally killing me."
Grumble, grumble, sip.

15:12.308 --> 15:14.129
- I don't grumble, grumble.

15:14.229 --> 15:15.450
- "Hmm, it's wine 30,
gotta have my juice."

15:15.550 --> 15:17.851
- You gave me that T-shirt!

15:17.951 --> 15:19.952
- Did you just...
- I did.

15:20.392 --> 15:22.373
[screams]

15:22.473 --> 15:25.294
[screams]
Oh.

15:25.394 --> 15:27.575
Ow, that sweater
had chunky buttons!

15:27.675 --> 15:29.256
- Well, those marshmallows
are really dense.

15:29.356 --> 15:31.817
[air horn blows]

15:31.917 --> 15:34.138
- Condor Girls.

15:34.238 --> 15:35.979
- Caw-Caw!
- Oh!

15:36.079 --> 15:39.260
- Uh, your Aunt Marina and I
were just practicing

15:39.360 --> 15:42.342
some radical honesty and
working out some of our issues.

15:42.442 --> 15:45.303
- Exactly. You know how you
and your cousins are besties

15:45.403 --> 15:48.424
but sometimes they do
little things that annoy you?

15:48.524 --> 15:49.545
- No.
- Never.

15:49.645 --> 15:51.226
- Gretchen and Shamiah
are perfect.

15:51.326 --> 15:54.067
- Okay.
- [chuckles]

15:54.167 --> 15:56.748
- Look, we're sorry that you--
that you had to see that.

15:56.848 --> 15:58.869
- Yeah.
- So, why don't we

15:58.969 --> 16:01.750
just sip some hot cocoa
and read Kate Bush lyrics?

16:01.850 --> 16:03.951
- Oh, or could we have
a marshmallow fight?

16:04.051 --> 16:06.793
- Well, Aunt Sarah
really worked hard

16:06.893 --> 16:08.754
at creating a schedule for us.

16:08.854 --> 16:12.395
So, let's follow that plan.

16:12.495 --> 16:14.596
[gasp]

16:14.696 --> 16:18.118
Oh, it's on.
[all screaming]

16:18.218 --> 16:19.719
- Attack!

16:19.819 --> 16:21.880
Yeah, attack!
[screams]

16:21.980 --> 16:23.981
- Thanks, Uncle Tommy.

16:24.741 --> 16:26.162
- I'm worried about JoJo.

16:26.262 --> 16:28.563
She hasn't posted
on social media in hours.

16:28.663 --> 16:29.803
- Wait, are you serious?

16:29.903 --> 16:31.144
Do you know where she is?
Should we call the cops?

16:31.224 --> 16:32.765
- Oh, she just went
to get coffee,

16:32.865 --> 16:34.325
but she would've posted
a million selfies by now.

16:34.425 --> 16:36.086
- Oh.

16:36.186 --> 16:38.167
Yeah, I mean,
Connor's not himself either.

16:38.267 --> 16:40.008
I've actually never
seen him so down.

16:40.108 --> 16:41.448
I mean, he was pretty broken up
when they cancelled

16:41.548 --> 16:44.730
"Crank Yankers," but this is
like some whole other level.

16:44.830 --> 16:46.331
- I really screwed this up.

16:46.431 --> 16:48.572
- No, come on.
It's my fault too.

16:48.672 --> 16:50.012
- Yeah, it's mostly your fault.

16:50.112 --> 16:51.813
- 50/50.
- 70/30.

16:51.913 --> 16:53.334
-Mm, it's hard to, kind of,
put a number on it.

16:53.434 --> 16:56.335
- We were definitely
getting along better than ever,

16:56.435 --> 16:59.617
but maybe she was
in such a good mood because

16:59.717 --> 17:01.578
she's in love.

17:01.678 --> 17:03.298
- [sighs]

17:03.398 --> 17:05.900
I feel bad. What should we do?
- What can we do?

17:06.000 --> 17:08.361
Maybe they'll talk
and get back together.

17:10.522 --> 17:13.283
- Or...
- I already don't like this.

17:14.964 --> 17:17.905
- Ooh.
- Girls still asleep?

17:18.005 --> 17:20.306
- Yeah. Giggling all night
will really take it out of you.

17:20.406 --> 17:22.307
- I guess we pulled it off.
Made them have too much fun.

17:22.407 --> 17:24.408
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

17:25.728 --> 17:27.509
I'm sorry about yesterday.

17:27.609 --> 17:30.711
You know, when we first met,
I was really impressed by you.

17:30.811 --> 17:33.792
And yeah, a little intimidated.

17:33.892 --> 17:36.673
I mean, you're an attorney
who can do handstands

17:36.773 --> 17:39.795
and also makes killer pancakes.
- [scoffs]

17:39.895 --> 17:41.796
- I mean, I don't really like
calling women badass, but...

17:41.896 --> 17:43.797
- It probably applies?
- Yes.

17:43.897 --> 17:46.078
- Yes, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

17:46.178 --> 17:47.438
- Listen,
you're not a complainer.

17:47.538 --> 17:49.119
I mean, yes, you complain,

17:49.219 --> 17:51.000
but about stuff
that really matters.

17:51.100 --> 17:54.201
I complain about
traffic and Tom.

17:54.301 --> 17:55.802
- [laughs]

17:55.902 --> 17:57.643
Okay, so can we just
put this behind us

17:57.743 --> 17:59.164
where it should've stayed
all along?

17:59.264 --> 18:00.644
- Yes, fighting about the past

18:00.744 --> 18:02.125
is something
that Tom and Connor do.

18:02.225 --> 18:04.566
- [groans]
Brothers are the worst.

18:04.666 --> 18:08.488
- Well, luckily,
you have a sister.

18:08.588 --> 18:09.928
- Are you trying
to make me cry?

18:10.028 --> 18:11.889
- Oh, get in here.
[laughs]

18:11.989 --> 18:13.850
- Stop!
- Don't push me.

18:13.950 --> 18:15.931
- You were being so loud.

18:16.031 --> 18:18.492
Gretchen was snoring all night.
- It was so annoying.

18:18.592 --> 18:20.413
- Wow, we really
brought them together.

18:20.513 --> 18:22.054
- Mm-hmm.

18:22.154 --> 18:23.335
Caw-caw.

18:23.435 --> 18:24.535
- Can we go home?

18:24.635 --> 18:25.856
I don't want to walk
in a park.

18:25.956 --> 18:27.416
- Oh, come on,
it's nice to be outside.

18:27.516 --> 18:29.577
Look, it's a fountain.

18:29.677 --> 18:31.258
- I know you're trying
to cheer me up,

18:31.358 --> 18:33.719
but I have a fountain at home.
- Well, you don't have this.

18:35.520 --> 18:37.861
- JoJo?
- Have you guys seen Kelvin?

18:37.961 --> 18:40.502
Denise texted that
he got attacked by a goose.

18:40.602 --> 18:42.823
- Ooh, I probably should've
scripted Denise's half of this.

18:42.923 --> 18:45.465
- Whoa, what are the chances

18:45.565 --> 18:48.226
of you two being in the
same place at the same time?

18:48.326 --> 18:51.227
- Okay, guessing there's
no violent goose on the loose.

18:51.327 --> 18:53.108
- The only goose
that's attacking right now

18:53.208 --> 18:54.669
is a love goose.

18:54.769 --> 18:57.030
- Really wish I'd done
a quick pass on this one.

18:57.130 --> 18:58.350
- Look, JoJo, I don't know
what's going on here,

18:58.450 --> 18:59.471
but I had nothing
to do with this.

18:59.571 --> 19:01.112
- Me neither.

19:01.212 --> 19:03.873
Look, whatever weird
romantic comedy thing

19:03.973 --> 19:06.394
you two are trying to pull off
isn't going to work, okay?

19:06.494 --> 19:07.635
I already know
how Connor feels.

19:07.735 --> 19:08.955
- No, you don't.

19:09.055 --> 19:11.716
The words Connor said
were not his.

19:11.816 --> 19:13.677
They were mine.

19:13.777 --> 19:17.679
- So, you broke us up
and now you're here to tell us

19:17.779 --> 19:19.080
we're actually perfect
for each other?

19:19.180 --> 19:21.921
- Whoa, no.
I would never say that.

19:22.021 --> 19:25.082
Do I think this
relationship would last?

19:25.182 --> 19:27.764
No, I don't think so.
- Kay.

19:27.864 --> 19:29.645
- Will there be screaming
and crying?

19:29.745 --> 19:31.285
Absolutely.
- Mm.

19:31.385 --> 19:33.406
- But I don't think
you should just give up

19:33.506 --> 19:35.207
because I think
you're gonna fail.

19:35.307 --> 19:39.029
You two deserve a chance
to fail on your own.

19:40.189 --> 19:41.370
- Thanks?
- Okay.

19:41.470 --> 19:43.531
- Yeah.
- Think about it like this.

19:43.631 --> 19:47.733
Denise is just a girl
standing in front of a boy,

19:47.833 --> 19:51.134
and a girl
and that boy's brother,

19:51.234 --> 19:53.255
asking them to keep
dating each other

19:53.355 --> 19:56.457
because they obviously want to.

19:56.557 --> 19:57.937
- What do you think about this?

19:58.037 --> 19:58.978
- I think this
is all very weird.

19:59.078 --> 20:00.619
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:00.719 --> 20:04.460
But there is nothing hotter
than proving my sister wrong.

20:04.560 --> 20:07.222
[Sixpence None the Richer's
"Kiss Me" playing]

20:07.322 --> 20:11.704
âª âª

20:11.804 --> 20:13.184
- âª Kiss me âª
- We don't need a soundtrack.

20:13.284 --> 20:14.545
- No? Okay.

20:14.645 --> 20:16.946
- Chapter 27:
The story of Tom's virginity

20:17.046 --> 20:18.267
- ended...
- Oh, let me just kind of,
sorry.

20:18.367 --> 20:19.667
Wrong button.
[chuckles]

20:19.767 --> 20:21.768
Continue.

20:24.849 --> 20:26.190
- Hey, did you know
about these two?

20:26.290 --> 20:27.671
- Of course.

20:27.771 --> 20:29.272
- Well, it's been hard
to keep it secret.

20:29.372 --> 20:31.573
- I have more secrets
than you can possibly imagine.

20:33.613 --> 20:37.435
- So, if they have kids,
what would they be to us?

20:37.535 --> 20:38.476
- I looked it up.

20:38.576 --> 20:39.716
It's still just
nieces and nephews.

20:39.816 --> 20:41.197
- Well, that's disappointing.

20:41.297 --> 20:43.758
So, all those times
you had to leave late at night

20:43.858 --> 20:45.839
were just excuses
to go meet up with Connor?

20:45.939 --> 20:47.520
Like, when you had
to wait in line

20:47.620 --> 20:49.921
till 3:00 a.m. for a
limited edition eyebrow pencil?

20:50.021 --> 20:51.642
- No, that was real,
and it was worth it.

20:51.742 --> 20:53.643
- I'm just happy
it's all out in the open,

20:53.743 --> 20:55.243
except definitely
don't tell the kids.

20:55.343 --> 20:57.004
Yeah, I'm not ready
to tell Gretchen yet.

20:57.104 --> 20:58.685
- Lips sealed.
- Yeah, of course.

20:58.785 --> 21:00.526
- When are you gonna
tell Gretchen?

21:00.626 --> 21:01.726
- Are you kidding me, Tom?

21:01.826 --> 21:03.207
You can't keep a secret
from a kid?

21:03.307 --> 21:04.367
- No, I can.

21:04.467 --> 21:05.768
I just have to take
all the kids

21:05.868 --> 21:06.969
to a science museum tomorrow,

21:07.069 --> 21:08.729
but I can totally
keep it quiet.

21:08.829 --> 21:11.291
- I'll take them.
- We'll take them.

21:11.391 --> 21:12.611
And I will not complain about

21:12.711 --> 21:14.812
the very distinct smell
in the planetarium,

21:14.912 --> 21:16.373
even though it's really bad.
- Unbearable.

21:16.473 --> 21:17.693
- Oh, yes.
- So stinky.

21:17.793 --> 21:18.474
- So stinky, right?
- The worst.

21:18.554 --> 21:20.555
- Like ham.
