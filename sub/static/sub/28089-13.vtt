00:20.158 --> 00:22.359
<i>Previously on
Doom Patrol...</i>

00:22.393 --> 00:25.230
I must've seen this ad
100 times as a girl.

00:25.263 --> 00:27.231
It's like he just walked out
of the comic book.

00:27.265 --> 00:30.601
The Hero of the Beach
is Flex Mentallo.

00:30.602 --> 00:32.704
The machine's taking over.
And I can't stop it.

00:32.737 --> 00:36.106
I just found out Flex
Mentallo has a wife named Dolores.

00:36.140 --> 00:37.942
She's old as fuck,
but she's still alive.

00:37.975 --> 00:39.944
You're the genius
who got a talking street

00:39.945 --> 00:42.246
to tell us that Flex is the key
to finding the Chief.

00:42.280 --> 00:44.115
- You must be Dolores.
- Look at my elbow.

00:44.148 --> 00:45.950
<i>The Bureau of Normalcy.</i>

00:45.951 --> 00:47.084
I was one of their assets.

00:47.085 --> 00:49.051
- For years, they tortured me.
- Where?

00:49.087 --> 00:50.820
<i>Welcome to
the Ant Farm.</i>

00:50.853 --> 00:52.390
Let me out!

00:52.423 --> 00:55.359
Hey, buddy? You're looking
for a way out? Trying to escape?

00:55.393 --> 00:57.195
- Who're you?
- 722.

00:57.228 --> 00:58.596
It is an
absolute pleasure to be

00:58.597 --> 01:00.697
- in your presence again, Trainor.
- Forsythe.

01:00.698 --> 01:02.932
<i>Your friends
are getting free,</i>

01:02.966 --> 01:04.468
but you're the last piece.

01:04.501 --> 01:07.138
<i>Under certain
conditions, these nanites...</i>

01:07.171 --> 01:08.774
<i>they can go rogue.</i>

01:08.775 --> 01:10.983
<i>- There would be nothing left of your son.
- Your point?</i>

01:11.007 --> 01:13.010
You made me this. A monster.

02:39.698 --> 02:43.967
Oh, wow.
Look, it's Flex Mentallo.

02:44.001 --> 02:45.349
Hi, Flex.

02:51.241 --> 02:52.575
Hi, Dolores.

02:52.610 --> 02:54.512
Morning, Flex.
How's it going?

02:54.544 --> 02:58.581
- Gentlemen.
- Hi, Dolores.

02:58.616 --> 03:00.417
- Here you go, my dear.
- Oh.

03:02.286 --> 03:03.454
How you doin'?

03:03.486 --> 03:06.757
"Our hometown hero,
Flex Mentallo,

03:06.788 --> 03:08.526
has done it again, folks."

03:08.560 --> 03:10.161
Oh, boy.

03:10.193 --> 03:12.896
Here we go.

03:12.931 --> 03:16.265
"Dr. Saucer's attempted
robbery of the local aquarium

03:16.300 --> 03:18.968
was thwarted by our very own

03:19.002 --> 03:24.002
Man of Muscle Mystery."

03:27.746 --> 03:30.514
"He made short work
of the dastardly dish-head

03:30.548 --> 03:32.883
by manipulating
the vibrational wavelengths

03:32.917 --> 03:35.818
of his magnificent muscles."

03:41.491 --> 03:43.394
"From the bottom of our hearts,

03:43.426 --> 03:48.426
this town thanks you,
Mr. Mentallo."

03:54.705 --> 03:57.039
My dear man,

03:57.074 --> 03:58.643
perfect as your body is,

03:58.675 --> 04:03.675
your best flex will always be
your smile.

04:05.049 --> 04:07.185
That laugh lights me up, Dolly.

04:07.217 --> 04:09.788
It was all dark before you.

04:09.819 --> 04:13.591
- You're the light of my life.
- Mmm.

04:13.625 --> 04:17.326
Help. Help!
Someone help!

04:17.362 --> 04:20.661
Someone help!

04:25.802 --> 04:27.338
Help me, please!

04:27.372 --> 04:32.343
Oh, no.

04:32.377 --> 04:35.677
What seems to be the trouble,
young man?

04:35.713 --> 04:36.713
That's right,

04:36.747 --> 04:40.985
it's me, Flex Mentallo,
Man of Muscle Mystery.

04:41.016 --> 04:43.887
How can I be of service?

04:46.088 --> 04:49.360
Ah. I see.

04:49.394 --> 04:52.596
That is troubling.

04:52.629 --> 04:53.831
Hmm.

04:53.865 --> 04:58.701
I think we could do
something about that.

04:58.737 --> 05:03.737
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty...

05:04.408 --> 05:07.408
That's a good kitty.

05:11.249 --> 05:16.249
Oh, look at you.
So fuzzy, cozy kitty.

05:23.461 --> 05:25.860
Target acquired.

05:58.528 --> 06:00.764
The miscreations
have taken control.

06:00.798 --> 06:03.500
I need every man still standing
to gear up!

06:03.533 --> 06:08.033
This is about containment now!

06:09.605 --> 06:11.375
Dad?

06:11.408 --> 06:14.110
Dad, wake up.

06:16.980 --> 06:18.983
I killed him.

06:19.016 --> 06:21.519
I...

06:21.552 --> 06:23.254
He's still alive.

06:23.286 --> 06:25.689
But we have to get him
out of here.

06:25.723 --> 06:27.524
Jane, tell Flit
to do the thing.

06:27.557 --> 06:29.326
- "Tell" her?
- Oh, boy.

06:29.360 --> 06:31.062
Jesus Christ.
You know what I mean!

06:31.096 --> 06:33.875
Sorry if I missed the subtext
of your incredibly blunt directive.

06:33.899 --> 06:35.665
Why don't you mansplain it to me?

06:35.699 --> 06:37.576
If there ever was a time
for you to let something go,

06:37.600 --> 06:38.670
this is that time!

06:38.701 --> 06:40.637
Not how it works, dude.

06:40.672 --> 06:45.672
Come on! We need to
get the fuck out of here, Jane!

06:52.716 --> 06:54.350
Please don't kill me!

06:58.855 --> 07:00.490
Say...

07:00.524 --> 07:04.161
Do I know you?

07:04.196 --> 07:09.196
But we're not supposed to leave
our rooms without permission.

07:09.665 --> 07:10.769
Hey!

07:10.802 --> 07:12.478
- Hey! My clicker!
- Guys, he's loosing blood.

07:12.502 --> 07:15.807
Or did you forget about that?

07:15.838 --> 07:19.377
Who the fuck are you?

07:19.410 --> 07:21.446
Well,
you sure do swear a lot.

07:21.478 --> 07:23.146
722?

07:23.180 --> 07:24.882
You almost look...

07:24.915 --> 07:26.918
But it couldn't be you,
could it?

07:26.951 --> 07:29.163
- Jane, would you please talk to Flit?
- What is it, Rita?

07:29.187 --> 07:31.588
Take away the ratty
beard and the baggy jumpsuit,

07:31.622 --> 07:34.524
and I swear he looks
just like Flex Mentallo.

07:34.559 --> 07:36.161
From Mentall-O's cereal?

07:36.194 --> 07:38.805
From the funny book Danny gave us.

07:38.829 --> 07:41.733
If we don't leave right
now, we ain't fucking leaving!

07:41.766 --> 07:43.634
Stop those abominations! Go!

07:43.668 --> 07:46.336
- Jane!
- Everybody grab on.

07:46.370 --> 07:51.170
Stop those abominations!

07:52.975 --> 07:54.612
Balls!

07:54.646 --> 07:57.548
Thank you.
Is that so fuckin' hard?

07:57.581 --> 08:01.418
Got it.

08:01.451 --> 08:04.822
Um... where am I?

08:04.855 --> 08:07.458
Also, does anyone else
feel, um,

08:07.492 --> 08:09.742
a little pukey?

08:14.132 --> 08:16.567
- Where did you take them?
- The hospital.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.435
You just left them there?

08:18.468 --> 08:19.637
As opposed to?

08:19.670 --> 08:21.372
Vic can't be alone right now.

08:21.403 --> 08:25.242
He's fragile.
And possibly psychotic.

08:25.276 --> 08:27.975
Who... Who is Vic?

08:30.682 --> 08:33.716
- Now it's Flitapalooza.
- Now he's not alone.

08:33.750 --> 08:35.284
What a mess.

08:35.317 --> 08:36.855
No. No.

08:36.888 --> 08:38.788
Guys, we actually did
something right.

08:38.822 --> 08:42.056
We went to rescue Vic,
and we motherhumping did it.

08:42.057 --> 08:42.994
Up top!

08:42.995 --> 08:47.096
He nearly beat his father
to death.

08:47.129 --> 08:48.331
And that's terrible.

08:48.365 --> 08:51.034
Really, really
fucking terrible.

08:51.067 --> 08:53.370
I don't think it should tar
our accomplishment.

08:53.403 --> 08:56.541
We saved a superhero.

08:56.572 --> 08:58.609
Us. The fuck-ups.

08:58.643 --> 09:01.610
I think we deserve
a small pat on the back for that.

09:01.644 --> 09:03.548
And we found Flex Mentallo.

09:03.581 --> 09:06.283
He's some kinda clue
to finding Niles, right?

09:06.317 --> 09:09.552
So it's not one,
but two things we nailed. Whoo!

09:09.586 --> 09:12.623
Let's hear it. Yeah! Whoo!

09:19.163 --> 09:21.566
Who's Flex Mentallo?

09:21.599 --> 09:23.932
You are.

09:23.966 --> 09:25.634
Am I?

09:25.668 --> 09:28.004
God damn it.

09:28.038 --> 09:31.173
You know, I'm feeling
a bit pukey myself.

09:31.206 --> 09:34.658
Think I'll go lay down.

09:43.019 --> 09:47.557
Look, we're not attached
at the hip anymore, okay?

10:02.673 --> 10:07.673
You don't have to be
everywhere I am.

10:17.620 --> 10:19.856
Look, it's nothing personal.
I'm just tired.

10:19.889 --> 10:23.293
And it's a little hard to sleep
with a six-foot nightlight...

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
How do you like your suit,
Captain Trainor? Comfortable?

10:36.375 --> 10:40.777
It weighs a ton
and smells like a chemical fire.

10:40.778 --> 10:42.579
But on the bright side
there's plenty of room

10:42.580 --> 10:45.250
to flail around
when you electrocute me.

10:45.283 --> 10:49.385
See, we took that very issue
into consideration

10:49.418 --> 10:52.724
while we were designing it.

10:52.755 --> 10:55.359
We're going to take a break
with that treatment

10:55.393 --> 10:57.226
in favor of something new.

10:57.259 --> 10:59.330
What?

10:59.363 --> 11:01.331
The being inside you

11:01.365 --> 11:03.466
has refused to evidence itself

11:03.500 --> 11:05.534
since that first encounter.

11:05.570 --> 11:07.605
What are you gonna do to me?

11:07.638 --> 11:10.841
What the hell
is that thing?

11:10.875 --> 11:12.610
Is something
supposed to happen?

11:12.643 --> 11:15.144
Oh, it's happening.

11:15.178 --> 11:18.315
You see, this device
produces a frequency

11:18.349 --> 11:20.951
imperceptible to human ears.

11:20.985 --> 11:24.221
But to your
luminescent friend? Well,

11:24.254 --> 11:29.225
in theory, it should be giving
him one doozy of a headache.

11:29.259 --> 11:31.827
Tell me, Captain Trainor,

11:31.863 --> 11:35.100
can you hear it
screaming inside of you?

11:35.133 --> 11:36.768
I can't say that I do.

11:36.801 --> 11:38.937
But if you wanna try your hand
at torturing it

11:38.970 --> 11:41.605
instead of me for a while,
then be my guest.

11:41.639 --> 11:43.505
Ah, ah, ah.

11:43.541 --> 11:45.408
What do you think
would happen to you

11:45.442 --> 11:48.547
if your host dies, hmm?

11:48.580 --> 11:51.749
I didn't want to commence
this particular experiment just yet,

11:51.783 --> 11:56.019
but I might be
persuaded otherwise.

11:56.052 --> 11:57.322
Good.

11:57.355 --> 12:02.355
I expect the next time
that I ask to see you...

12:02.493 --> 12:06.091
I won't be left to wait.

12:31.053 --> 12:33.658
Hey, pal,
you okay in there?

12:33.691 --> 12:37.028
What?
Who the hell are you?

12:37.061 --> 12:40.798
Sounded like you were screaming
bloody murder.

12:40.831 --> 12:43.067
No. No, that wasn't me.

12:43.100 --> 12:46.403
I don't mean nothing
by it. It's just...

12:46.437 --> 12:47.870
Well, it sounded bad is all.

12:47.903 --> 12:50.474
I'm not embarrassed.
I'm stating a fact.

12:50.508 --> 12:52.509
I was unconscious. The...

12:52.543 --> 12:54.644
The screaming was
probably from...

12:54.677 --> 12:56.245
Wait.

12:56.279 --> 12:58.682
- You could hear it?
- And then some.

12:58.716 --> 13:00.518
Is there something in there
with you?

13:00.551 --> 13:02.153
So to speak.

13:02.187 --> 13:05.923
Look, I don't feel like
talking anymore, okay?

13:05.956 --> 13:10.494
Well, say, pal, uh,
what's your name?

13:10.528 --> 13:13.297
721.

13:13.330 --> 13:14.663
Your real name.

13:17.668 --> 13:20.803
Doesn't matter.

13:20.836 --> 13:22.706
Sounds like
you've been in here a while.

13:22.740 --> 13:26.878
I tried to keep track
of the days at first, but...

13:26.909 --> 13:29.648
it just made things worse.

13:29.681 --> 13:34.018
Well, I'm not planning on sticking
around here long enough to find out.

13:34.052 --> 13:36.385
Here, have a look.

13:39.791 --> 13:42.639
What the...

13:49.767 --> 13:52.403
- How did you...
- Muscle Mystery powers, bub.

13:52.437 --> 13:56.908
They got these things
all over me to tamp it down.

13:56.941 --> 13:58.975
If you could just reach in here

13:59.009 --> 14:01.546
and yank out
some of these cords,

14:01.580 --> 14:04.416
I can open up a hole big
enough for us to walk through.

14:04.447 --> 14:09.447
No. Are you... No.
There's no escaping this place.

14:09.488 --> 14:12.788
- Don't you wanna at least try?
- Stop talking to me.

14:12.822 --> 14:15.822
Come on, pal.

14:20.730 --> 14:22.000
Jesus, what...

14:25.634 --> 14:27.839
I'm Flex Mentallo.

14:27.870 --> 14:30.807
Man of Muscle Mystery. What...

14:30.841 --> 14:34.346
Nice to meet you, too.

14:34.379 --> 14:38.283
Where are you
from there, Sparky?

14:38.316 --> 14:40.551
What is that,
some kind of other...

14:40.582 --> 14:42.620
dimension or...

14:42.653 --> 14:44.989
I'm sure
I can get you back there.

14:45.023 --> 14:48.557
I can open up
a door to anywhere.

14:48.591 --> 14:50.326
You will?

14:50.360 --> 14:51.730
That's fantastic.

14:51.763 --> 14:54.139
Alls you got to do is reach in
here and yank out some of these...

14:54.163 --> 14:59.163
Shh! Hold on. Hold on.

15:04.142 --> 15:08.445
Modesty is what separates us
from the animals, 722.

15:08.479 --> 15:13.450
Let's get you dressed.

15:19.855 --> 15:23.605
My name is Flex Mentallo.

15:36.273 --> 15:37.273
Again.

15:50.288 --> 15:53.456
Who is this handsome devil?

15:53.490 --> 15:56.058
It's you.

15:56.094 --> 15:57.427
I don't think so, Scrap.

15:57.461 --> 15:59.297
I still have that thing
on my head, don't I?

15:59.330 --> 16:03.667
Hey, Jane,
can you help me out with this?

16:05.003 --> 16:07.037
- You just ripped the "S" off, didn't you?
- Uh-huh.

16:07.038 --> 16:08.306
- Hey, hey.
- Huh?

16:08.339 --> 16:10.774
You were the cartoon mascot
for a kid cereal,

16:10.807 --> 16:15.046
created by an adman
named Wally Sage.

16:15.077 --> 16:18.115
Do you remember Wally?

16:18.149 --> 16:19.350
I don't know.

16:19.384 --> 16:21.052
Why were you
at the Ant Farm?

16:21.085 --> 16:23.921
What's your super power?

16:23.955 --> 16:27.057
I don't know.

16:27.091 --> 16:28.926
How did you
get out of the ad?

16:28.960 --> 16:30.759
And if you say
"I don't know" again,

16:30.793 --> 16:33.931
I'll make you eat your beard.

16:33.965 --> 16:35.133
Um...

16:35.166 --> 16:37.301
Oh, for fuck's sake.

16:37.302 --> 16:39.570
We can ask this ding-dong
questions till the end of time,

16:39.571 --> 16:42.706
it's not gonna get us
any closer to finding the Chief.

16:42.740 --> 16:45.709
Did you say "the Chief"?

16:45.710 --> 16:46.710
You know him?

16:46.711 --> 16:47.846
Well, I certainly do.

16:47.879 --> 16:50.215
And let me tell you something, friends.
That Chief,

16:50.248 --> 16:52.950
well, he's a real
no good son-of-a-you-know-what.

16:52.951 --> 16:54.518
- What'd he do?
- Well, nothing,

16:54.519 --> 16:56.254
considering that he died
20 years ago.

16:56.287 --> 16:58.355
- Wait. What?
- Look, shitbag,

16:58.389 --> 16:59.956
I've known the Chief
for 50 years.

16:59.990 --> 17:01.793
And if he had died,
I would've noticed.

17:01.826 --> 17:04.563
Well, not if his identical
twin brother replaced him.

17:04.596 --> 17:06.798
- Whoa. Say what now?
- His name was Nic.

17:06.832 --> 17:09.834
And their mother had to give him
up at birth to a gypsy woman.

17:09.865 --> 17:12.237
The Chief never knew
of his existence.

17:12.269 --> 17:13.505
- The fuck?
- Yeah.

17:13.538 --> 17:15.971
Nic grew up
so full of hate and rage,

17:16.007 --> 17:17.540
that by the time
that he met Chief,

17:17.576 --> 17:20.711
he murdered him
and stole his life.

17:20.746 --> 17:24.449
And then, fathered a love
child with the Chief's wife,

17:24.480 --> 17:28.086
Joanna Heart,
who, as it turns out,

17:28.117 --> 17:30.121
was their sister.

17:30.153 --> 17:34.990
And she was in a coma
when she gave birth, right?

17:35.026 --> 17:36.760
Yeah.

17:36.795 --> 17:39.195
He's talking about Chief
Kinkaid from <i>Secret Hearts,</i>

17:39.230 --> 17:41.064
some fucking crappy soap opera.

17:41.065 --> 17:42.431
- It's not crappy.
- You know,

17:42.432 --> 17:44.701
I was
actually on that show once.

17:44.733 --> 17:46.001
Special guest star.

17:46.037 --> 17:47.636
Really? Who were you?

17:47.671 --> 17:48.873
I played myself,

17:48.904 --> 17:50.875
famous race car driver
Cliff Steele.

17:50.906 --> 17:52.509
Barf.

17:52.544 --> 17:53.876
I don't remember that one.

17:53.911 --> 17:55.346
What else
is fucking new?

17:55.380 --> 17:56.381
I don't know what to do.

17:56.413 --> 17:58.383
Say, who is this
handsome devil?

17:58.414 --> 18:00.750
Still you, dum-dum.

18:02.420 --> 18:07.420
He looks like the type of
person I'd like to be.

18:08.226 --> 18:09.394
Take off your clothes.

18:09.425 --> 18:11.361
Jane, I don't think
we can ask him...

18:11.394 --> 18:12.596
Okay.

18:12.630 --> 18:17.166
Yeah.

18:19.537 --> 18:21.904
The doctor said
he's going to be fine.

18:21.939 --> 18:23.141
No.

18:23.173 --> 18:25.209
She said he was stable.

18:27.376 --> 18:31.250
- Vic, don't.
- Don't what?

18:31.281 --> 18:35.318
Mr. Nobody didn't plant that seed of doubt
in my head, I did that all on my own.

18:35.353 --> 18:39.923
He just twisted it until...

18:39.957 --> 18:42.326
My dad just wanted me to
re-install Grid.

18:42.358 --> 18:45.229
He was trying to save me.

18:45.261 --> 18:47.432
I just couldn't see it.

18:47.463 --> 18:52.067
Your head is clear now.

18:52.103 --> 18:56.875
We need you to
turn Grid back on.

18:56.906 --> 18:59.241
Do you remember the tracker
I put on the Beard Hunter?

18:59.277 --> 19:01.113
Without Grid, it's useless.

19:01.144 --> 19:04.079
The longer we wait to go after
him, the further away he'll get.

19:04.115 --> 19:05.583
If we can find
the Beard Hunter,

19:05.615 --> 19:07.250
- we can find the Chief.
- I can't.

19:07.285 --> 19:08.920
Yes, you can.

19:08.952 --> 19:12.722
Mr. Nobody was playing
with your head, you know that.

19:12.757 --> 19:15.092
- There's nothing to be afraid of...
- How can I be sure?

19:15.125 --> 19:17.693
Because you just said...

19:17.728 --> 19:19.497
I know what I said.

19:19.529 --> 19:24.335
Knowing doesn't change
how I feel.

19:24.367 --> 19:25.836
Mr. Nobody told us

19:25.868 --> 19:27.872
not to go after him.

19:27.903 --> 19:31.505
We should have listened.

20:05.410 --> 20:08.479
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

20:08.510 --> 20:11.781
Nope.

20:11.817 --> 20:14.183
- Ow!
- Sorry. Just...

20:14.218 --> 20:16.820
Robot fingers.

20:16.855 --> 20:19.788
Too bad no one in the Underground
went to beauty school.

20:19.824 --> 20:21.173
Did they?

20:26.932 --> 20:29.432
Speaking of, how's
everyone doing down there?

20:29.467 --> 20:31.934
Never mind.

20:31.969 --> 20:33.304
Cool.

20:33.336 --> 20:35.972
- Ooh!
- Sorry. Sorry.

20:36.008 --> 20:38.385
It's just we haven't had a chance to
talk about what happened in there

20:38.409 --> 20:40.846
and I wanted to make sure
that you and the others were...

20:40.877 --> 20:43.448
I don't wanna
talk about the Underground.

20:43.480 --> 20:45.481
Bring it up again
and I'll do to your brain

20:45.482 --> 20:46.851
what I'm doing
to this chump's hair.

20:46.852 --> 20:48.384
Are you mad at me
for going in there?

20:48.419 --> 20:53.419
- Because technically it wasn't...
- Finished!

20:57.126 --> 20:59.695
- Ta-da.
- God...

21:01.365 --> 21:04.769
I look incredible.

21:04.803 --> 21:07.372
Kinda like that hunk
on that cereal box.

21:07.403 --> 21:09.905
If he'd been
stabbed in the face repeatedly.

21:09.940 --> 21:11.976
You are that hunk, dummy.

21:12.009 --> 21:16.346
Hmm, I don't think so.

21:16.381 --> 21:17.814
Hey, I just remembered.

21:17.815 --> 21:18.781
What?

21:18.782 --> 21:21.486
<i>Secret Hearts</i> is on
in five minutes.

21:21.519 --> 21:22.886
Oh, fuck me.

21:22.921 --> 21:25.891
<i>...after the news broke
that Steve Larson,</i>

21:25.923 --> 21:28.692
<i>better known as
Animal Vegetable Mineral Man,</i>

21:28.727 --> 21:32.064
<i>had reached an immunity deal
with federal prosecutors</i>

21:32.096 --> 21:36.500
<i>in exchange for information about
a mysterious medical facility</i>

21:36.534 --> 21:39.537
<i>hidden deep
in a Paraguayan jungle.</i>

21:39.569 --> 21:41.239
<i>As Larson
approached the courthouse</i>

21:41.270 --> 21:43.339
<i>where he was
set to give his testimony,</i>

21:43.374 --> 21:45.643
<i>he was viciously gunned down</i>

21:45.675 --> 21:47.943
<i>by a man
authorities are calling</i>

21:47.978 --> 21:51.414
a devotee to mad Nazi scientist

21:51.449 --> 21:54.550
<i>Heinrich Von Fuchs.</i>

21:54.586 --> 21:57.188
We have no comment!
Stop talking!

21:57.221 --> 21:58.288
Shut up!

21:58.320 --> 22:00.958
Von Fuchs is uber!

22:00.990 --> 22:02.858
Von Fuchs is uber!

22:02.893 --> 22:05.261
Von Fuchs is uber!

22:05.296 --> 22:08.230
No fighting! No fighting!

22:08.266 --> 22:10.367
<i>No, no, no... No fighting!</i>

22:10.402 --> 22:13.770
<i>Thankfully, Larson
was only shot in the minerals,</i>

22:13.805 --> 22:15.707
<i>and is expected to
make a full recovery.</i>

<i>The assassin, identified by
authorities as Gary Gunnam,</i>

22:19.576 --> 22:21.377
<i>was apprehended on site.</i>

22:21.412 --> 22:26.412
<i>His arraignment
is set for early next...</i>

22:34.923 --> 22:37.625
Here I am.

22:42.598 --> 22:43.902
<i>Eye witnesses</i>

22:43.933 --> 22:48.933
<i>said it was
practically impossible to hear...</i>

23:07.625 --> 23:11.996
Oh, excuse... Excuse me, miss?

23:12.028 --> 23:13.195
Are you a doctor?

23:13.230 --> 23:14.463
Oh, no, no.

23:14.499 --> 23:16.567
It's impossible

23:16.601 --> 23:18.634
to find your room

23:18.670 --> 23:21.873
in this cockamie place.

23:21.905 --> 23:26.242
Well, I'd really like to go
lay down.

23:26.277 --> 23:29.413
Of course.

23:29.445 --> 23:31.949
- Thank you, miss...
- Rita.

23:31.980 --> 23:35.950
Rita.

23:35.951 --> 23:36.788
And away we go.

23:36.789 --> 23:38.890
Away we go is right, yeah.

23:38.923 --> 23:40.824
Do you remember
your room number?

23:40.856 --> 23:43.559
No. No.

23:43.595 --> 23:47.096
But I'm sure
if we wander around a little,

23:47.131 --> 23:48.531
we'll find it.

23:48.566 --> 23:50.367
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah.

23:50.402 --> 23:53.872
I'm telling you, Chief Kinkaid,
<i>the Port Charlotte Ripper is back.</i>

23:53.903 --> 23:56.574
<i>I did the autopsies
on all his victims.</i>

23:56.606 --> 23:58.375
<i>This is his M.O.</i>

23:58.409 --> 24:00.144
<i>That's impossible,
Dr. Winslow.</i>

24:00.178 --> 24:04.413
<i>The Port Charlotte Ripper
was executed last summer.</i>

24:04.414 --> 24:07.384
<i>- Unless...
- You arrested the wrong man.</i>

24:07.416 --> 24:09.118
<i>- Damn it.
- Oh, my God.</i>

24:09.153 --> 24:10.653
This is bad!

24:10.688 --> 24:13.022
Was it always this bad?

24:13.057 --> 24:15.858
'Cause I do not remember it being this bad.

24:15.894 --> 24:17.797
- <i>It's true.
- Jeez.</i>

24:17.828 --> 24:20.439
<i>And I don't care that you ran
off and married that Japanese sex robot.</i>

24:20.463 --> 24:23.468
I've never stopped loving you.

24:23.500 --> 24:24.736
<i>Kinkaid, please.</i>

24:24.769 --> 24:26.569
<i>The Takumi-3000
will never love you</i>

24:26.604 --> 24:28.538
<i>the way that I love you.</i>

24:28.573 --> 24:31.674
We tried the carrot
to jiggle this chump's memory.

24:31.709 --> 24:34.577
Maybe it's time to
jab him with a stick.

24:34.612 --> 24:36.579
Uh, okay.

24:36.614 --> 24:38.950
What if we try to
trigger his super power?

24:38.982 --> 24:41.353
Maybe using it will
jog something loose.

24:41.384 --> 24:46.155
And if it doesn't, well, at least
we'll know what he can do.

24:46.190 --> 24:47.392
Oh, no. Dead.

24:47.424 --> 24:49.369
Then we can figure out how
to use it to find the Chief.

24:49.393 --> 24:51.295
<i>My name is Natalia.</i>

24:51.327 --> 24:52.663
<i>And I'm not a doctor.</i>

24:52.695 --> 24:55.030
Trigger his power how exactly?

24:55.065 --> 24:57.268
- Through duress.
- Duress?

24:57.299 --> 24:58.935
- Duress.
- Duress.

24:58.970 --> 25:01.538
- Let's do this.
- "Let's"? Meaning me.

25:01.573 --> 25:05.343
He got his panties in a wad
when you talked over his stories.

25:05.344 --> 25:06.575
Go over there and try it again.

25:06.576 --> 25:08.778
Only this time, don't let up.

25:08.813 --> 25:12.548
- That's it? That's the plan?
- You got a problem, shitstain?

25:12.583 --> 25:15.519
Go!

25:20.692 --> 25:22.326
Hey, buddy.
How's the episode?

25:24.894 --> 25:26.364
Which one is the...

25:26.395 --> 25:29.997
- Mmm-hmm.
- Jeez.

26:19.048 --> 26:23.519
Perhaps I should find a family
member to come help you.

26:23.554 --> 26:26.923
Yeah, yeah.

26:26.958 --> 26:29.992
Well, if you do find
a family member to help me,

26:30.028 --> 26:34.530
then I'm going to nominate you
for a Nobel Peace Prize.

26:34.565 --> 26:37.433
They just left you here
all alone?

26:37.468 --> 26:40.703
Well, technically, but I...

26:40.738 --> 26:44.008
I left before them.

26:44.039 --> 26:46.241
I skipped out...

26:46.277 --> 26:48.680
middle of the night.

26:48.711 --> 26:51.413
Never looked back.

26:54.519 --> 26:56.220
Oh...

26:56.251 --> 26:58.623
The worst thing I ever done.

26:58.654 --> 27:01.026
Well, if that's the worst thing
you ever did...

27:01.057 --> 27:03.326
- Yeah.
- ...consider yourself lucky.

27:03.361 --> 27:04.394
Oh, yeah?

27:04.428 --> 27:07.298
You're a saint compared to me.

27:07.329 --> 27:08.634
Stop it.

27:08.665 --> 27:12.135
A nice girl like you, you'd never
have done a thing like that.

27:12.170 --> 27:15.137
- I'm not a "nice girl."
- Well...

27:15.172 --> 27:18.009
I've made mistakes.

27:18.041 --> 27:21.010
My friend is in trouble,
I want to help him.

27:21.046 --> 27:24.382
But someone is threatening to
use those mistakes against me.

27:24.413 --> 27:26.217
I'm powerless.

27:26.250 --> 27:30.252
Yeah. If you ask me,

27:30.287 --> 27:33.958
we have to own our mistakes.

27:33.990 --> 27:38.193
No matter how terrible.

27:38.229 --> 27:41.163
I'm an actress.

27:41.198 --> 27:44.102
I was an actress.

27:44.134 --> 27:47.104
The warmth
of the spotlight, it's...

27:47.135 --> 27:50.740
intoxicating.

27:50.741 --> 27:52.575
When that light goes out,
you're willing to do

27:52.576 --> 27:56.145
just about anything
to get it back.

27:56.181 --> 28:00.419
When you reach a certain age
in this business,

28:00.451 --> 28:04.188
the phones don't ring quite as
frequently as they used to.

28:04.189 --> 28:07.892
That's when I met
Gene Stanton...

28:07.893 --> 28:12.695
World-renowned, six-time
Oscar winning film producer.

28:12.730 --> 28:15.900
I know what you're thinking,
and no.

28:15.932 --> 28:17.933
Despite his best efforts,

28:17.934 --> 28:20.270
nothing ever happened
between Gene and I.

28:20.305 --> 28:24.275
He reeked of Acqua di Parma
and cheap cigars.

28:24.307 --> 28:27.979
And I had my self-respect.

28:28.010 --> 28:33.010
And one day
Gene asked for a favor.

28:34.086 --> 28:38.423
It seemed so simple
at the time.

28:38.457 --> 28:42.759
Gene had his eye
on a young Hollywood starlet,

28:42.794 --> 28:45.797
and all I had to do was
arrange for them to meet.

28:45.828 --> 28:49.901
Beverly Hills Hotel,
9:00 p.m.

28:49.932 --> 28:51.303
One year later,

28:51.336 --> 28:54.137
that actress was bawling her
way through an Oscar speech.

28:54.172 --> 28:57.642
I was getting offers again.
And Gene...

28:57.673 --> 28:59.410
got what Gene wanted.

28:59.442 --> 29:02.814
It was a win-win-win.

29:02.846 --> 29:07.549
So, I arranged
another meeting for him.

29:07.585 --> 29:11.587
And another. And another.

29:11.622 --> 29:13.557
Each girl rose to stardom.

29:13.589 --> 29:17.490
And my phone kept ringing.

29:19.596 --> 29:22.432
And then came Marybeth Wooten.

29:22.464 --> 29:25.103
She had her meeting with Gene.

29:25.134 --> 29:30.134
And nine months later,
there was a baby.

29:32.875 --> 29:36.448
Gene wasn't about to step up
and become a father.

29:36.480 --> 29:39.316
That poor
girl didn't have anyone,

29:39.348 --> 29:43.287
so she came to me.

29:43.318 --> 29:44.819
I gave her...

29:44.820 --> 29:46.923
$100.

29:46.958 --> 29:50.928
And I sent her on her way.

29:50.961 --> 29:53.896
I told myself
that she would find the grit

29:53.931 --> 29:57.867
to pull herself up.

29:57.902 --> 30:00.269
But deep down,

30:00.304 --> 30:02.403
I knew better.

30:05.910 --> 30:08.679
A week later,

30:08.711 --> 30:13.583
there it was, in the paper.

30:13.584 --> 30:18.020
Marybeth had taken
her own life.

30:18.056 --> 30:20.022
No mention of the baby.

30:20.057 --> 30:25.057
It was like
it never even existed.

30:28.066 --> 30:30.601
For a brief,
guilt-soaked moment,

30:30.634 --> 30:33.037
I considered

30:33.069 --> 30:36.807
taking responsibility
for the child,

30:36.839 --> 30:40.442
but then my phone rang.

30:40.478 --> 30:42.211
I got the lead role

30:42.247 --> 30:47.247
in a sweeping big-budget epic
called <i>Forbidden Congo.</i>

30:49.153 --> 30:51.423
I was in the spotlight again.

30:51.454 --> 30:56.454
And it was just as warm
as I remembered.

31:00.499 --> 31:03.067
Looking the other way
should be so much harder

31:03.101 --> 31:07.471
than it actually is.

31:07.506 --> 31:11.909
Everything that happened to me
on that picture,

31:11.942 --> 31:16.942
and everything
that happened after...

31:17.448 --> 31:20.852
I deserved all of it.

31:20.884 --> 31:23.519
I, too, have spent a lifetime

31:23.554 --> 31:25.756
searching for absolution.

31:25.788 --> 31:29.240
But it will never come.

31:35.230 --> 31:38.970
I think...

31:39.001 --> 31:43.653
you got your power back, kiddo.

31:58.954 --> 32:00.089
Sir, it's been five hours.

32:00.124 --> 32:02.925
I'm not sure it can take
much more of this.

32:02.960 --> 32:05.596
Maybe it's time we let it
re-enter Trainor's body.

32:05.627 --> 32:06.864
Just a little bit longer.

32:06.896 --> 32:08.198
Sir, we don't have
an SI base unit

32:08.199 --> 32:09.798
to quantify
whatever this thing is,

32:09.834 --> 32:11.634
but there's been
a significant drop off

32:11.669 --> 32:13.069
in what we can measure.

32:13.104 --> 32:15.573
Coulombs, volts,
amperes, joules...

32:15.605 --> 32:17.374
They're all plummeting.

32:17.406 --> 32:20.111
Meaning?

32:20.144 --> 32:23.742
I think it's dying, sir.

32:35.692 --> 32:38.961
Where ya been, Sparky?
Uh, you okay?

32:38.996 --> 32:40.163
What?

32:40.198 --> 32:43.799
I'm not talking
to you, bub.

32:43.834 --> 32:45.303
Jeez, Sparky.

32:45.336 --> 32:48.837
I'm gonna get you out of here
right now.

32:48.873 --> 32:50.575
Hey, pal.

32:50.607 --> 32:52.209
Me and Sparky
are gonna blow this joint.

32:52.210 --> 32:53.911
He says you got to
come with us.

32:53.943 --> 32:56.380
Look,
I told you to leave me alone.

32:56.381 --> 32:57.381
No can-do-ski.

32:57.382 --> 32:59.316
Apparently he can't go nowhere
without you.

32:59.317 --> 33:01.151
So, why don't you
take your chicken wing there,

33:01.152 --> 33:02.420
reach through this here hole,

33:02.452 --> 33:07.452
and pull out
some of these dang cords, would ya?

33:11.229 --> 33:13.596
I can't.
If this suit gets damaged

33:13.632 --> 33:15.865
I'd be putting
thousands of people at risk.

33:15.900 --> 33:19.048
What? Come on.

33:24.342 --> 33:26.242
There's no place for me
out there.

33:26.277 --> 33:28.813
They're torturing your friend
in here, man.

33:28.846 --> 33:31.847
I can't, okay? I can't.

33:31.883 --> 33:33.550
I can't.

33:33.585 --> 33:35.487
- I can't.
- Come on, man! They're coming!

33:35.519 --> 33:37.587
We got no time,
you gotta make a move here!

33:37.622 --> 33:41.258
Come on! Just reach your hand...

33:41.289 --> 33:42.490
Damn it!

33:47.230 --> 33:49.601
Perhaps our good friend, 722,

33:49.634 --> 33:54.634
will agree to come quietly
this afternoon.

34:04.713 --> 34:08.786
My name is Flex Mentallo.

34:08.818 --> 34:10.355
I see.

34:10.387 --> 34:15.387
Perhaps this will
change your mind.

34:22.166 --> 34:24.001
A boob tube?

34:24.034 --> 34:25.536
Really?

34:25.570 --> 34:28.670
This is your grand plan
to subdue me?

34:28.672 --> 34:29.574
Well,

34:29.574 --> 34:34.574
you can fight this
all you want, 722.

34:34.777 --> 34:37.181
But the simple fact is

34:37.215 --> 34:40.751
you're no longer
who you once were.

34:40.786 --> 34:45.123
You're the property
of the US government.

34:45.155 --> 34:47.023
So I suggest

34:47.056 --> 34:50.027
you fall into rank.

34:50.061 --> 34:51.260
Or what?

35:01.204 --> 35:04.708
<i>Let me go.</i>

35:04.742 --> 35:05.844
<i>Please.</i>

35:05.876 --> 35:08.055
- You have no right to do this.
- Get away from my wife.

35:08.079 --> 35:10.614
Get away!

35:10.648 --> 35:13.418
Get away from my wife!

35:13.451 --> 35:15.219
<i>Wonder how she'll smell
when she's burning.</i>

35:15.253 --> 35:16.454
Dolly. No, no, no, no!

35:16.487 --> 35:18.956
Stop that.

35:18.989 --> 35:21.525
Stop!

35:21.556 --> 35:22.693
Stop!

35:22.726 --> 35:26.130
Careful. One wrong move and, well...

35:26.164 --> 35:28.166
Let her go! She...

35:28.199 --> 35:31.001
She's got nothing to do
with this, man!

35:31.034 --> 35:35.472
We're reasonable people.

35:35.507 --> 35:39.210
Now, if you play by the rules,

35:39.242 --> 35:41.911
maybe we'll allow you to

35:41.945 --> 35:44.981
tune in next week
and see her again.

35:45.016 --> 35:47.518
Same time.

35:47.550 --> 35:49.719
Same place.

35:49.753 --> 35:51.422
All we want

35:51.456 --> 35:54.224
is for you to be the hero

35:54.257 --> 35:56.958
that you are, 722.

36:05.635 --> 36:09.306
Sorry, Sparky.

36:09.340 --> 36:12.039
I beg your pardon?

36:24.755 --> 36:27.905
Follow me.

36:59.889 --> 37:02.659
All those years...

37:02.693 --> 37:06.931
Because of me.

37:06.963 --> 37:09.534
Then what?

37:09.567 --> 37:12.402
I... I can't understand you
like Flex can.

37:12.436 --> 37:16.487
What do you want me to see?

37:20.143 --> 37:22.579
Dolores.

37:22.614 --> 37:25.915
<i>There is love
that we have in the open...</i>

37:25.916 --> 37:30.951
<i>then there's what's hidden in the
depths of our secret hearts.</i>

37:31.556 --> 37:33.224
<i>More chocolate sauce?</i>

37:33.257 --> 37:36.693
Yeah? Yeah! Yeah.

37:36.726 --> 37:39.197
Mmm. Mmm!

37:40.632 --> 37:43.201
<i>Waco, waco.
waco, waco.</i>

37:43.233 --> 37:46.603
<i>I'm a pole position man
myself, Billy.</i>

37:46.637 --> 37:49.005
<i>Holy smokes, it's my hero,</i>

37:49.039 --> 37:51.076
<i>race car driver Cliff Steele.</i>

37:51.108 --> 37:55.612
<i>That's right, Billy.
I'm here to make you feel better.</i>

37:55.646 --> 37:58.282
<i>I'm race car driver
Cliff Steele.</i>

37:58.315 --> 37:59.416
Vernon Reid for Augusta.

37:59.449 --> 38:01.952
Oh, my God. Is that you?

38:01.987 --> 38:03.597
Ya know, there actually
was some buzz about

38:03.621 --> 38:05.356
a Daytime Emmy for me
after this aired.

38:05.389 --> 38:07.592
For what?
Best Supporting Ass Clown?

38:07.625 --> 38:10.094
Hey, you know,
acting's hard, all right?

38:10.126 --> 38:11.862
And I...

38:11.896 --> 38:15.795
What the hell is that for?

38:17.601 --> 38:21.271
We've tried everything we can
to try to fix this chucklefuck.

38:21.304 --> 38:22.939
It's time to
kick it up a notch.

38:23.807 --> 38:25.409
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow down.

38:25.443 --> 38:26.911
- What?
- Slow down. Slow down.

38:26.945 --> 38:28.823
Don't you think we might be
taking this a bit too far?

38:28.847 --> 38:32.382
Oh, relax. We're not
actually going to torch him.

38:32.416 --> 38:34.018
We're gonna
make him think we are.

38:34.052 --> 38:36.021
Still, we're messing with
the poor guy's head.

38:36.054 --> 38:38.355
I'd have thought you of all
people might be against that.

38:38.356 --> 38:39.555
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

38:39.556 --> 38:41.092
Nothing. It's just I,

38:41.126 --> 38:43.003
you know, I'd have thought you
might have a little more empathy

38:43.027 --> 38:44.994
given everything I saw
in the Underground.

38:45.027 --> 38:46.496
Oh, my God.

38:46.530 --> 38:48.065
All right, listen.

38:48.099 --> 38:49.300
This is not about me

38:49.333 --> 38:50.802
or the fucking Underground,

38:50.835 --> 38:53.538
or whatever touchy-feely
Oprah bullshit

38:53.570 --> 38:54.940
you're trying to pull right now.

38:54.972 --> 38:56.873
This is about
getting the Chief back.

38:56.907 --> 38:57.909
So get off my jock.

38:57.943 --> 39:00.344
- I can tell your upset.
- Fuck off, Cliff.

39:00.378 --> 39:01.912
And you have every right to be.

39:01.913 --> 39:03.613
- Kill yourself, Cliff.
- And I just want to say...

39:03.614 --> 39:08.018
- Eat shit, Cliff.
- That I'm sorry.

39:08.052 --> 39:10.855
I saw things you probably
didn't want me to see.

39:10.889 --> 39:13.391
Even though
I didn't mean to, still...

39:13.422 --> 39:14.757
That wasn't cool.

39:14.791 --> 39:16.159
And I'm sorry.

39:16.193 --> 39:18.195
I only wanted to help.

39:18.228 --> 39:19.664
And I just wanna say,

39:19.697 --> 39:23.568
if you ever need to
talk about it, I'm here.

39:23.601 --> 39:26.202
I don't need to talk about it.

39:44.956 --> 39:47.090
I know
how to get his memory back.

39:47.123 --> 39:48.692
- How?
- Dolores.

39:48.693 --> 39:49.693
His wife.

39:49.694 --> 39:52.128
If we find her,
maybe he finds his powers.

39:52.163 --> 39:53.963
Maybe that gets us
to the Chief.

39:53.998 --> 39:55.599
Wait. Dolores?

39:55.632 --> 39:59.503
As in the lady who set you up?
Fuck that.

39:59.536 --> 40:02.085
I can handle her.

40:05.208 --> 40:07.545
<i>This should make you better.</i>

40:07.579 --> 40:10.081
<i>Strong and fast.</i>

40:12.449 --> 40:13.550
<i>Why?</i>

40:13.585 --> 40:16.855
Wow, Cliff.
You're really good.

40:16.887 --> 40:21.887
There was some buzz
about a Daytime Emmy for me.

40:23.159 --> 40:25.829
Ta-da!

40:25.862 --> 40:27.664
Uh-oh.

40:27.699 --> 40:31.034
Hello, young man.

40:31.068 --> 40:34.204
Look at my elbow.

40:36.273 --> 40:39.143
That laugh, I...

40:39.175 --> 40:43.681
I've heard it before.

40:43.715 --> 40:47.914
- Dolores?
- Hello, young man.

40:51.956 --> 40:54.655
Dolores, it's you.

40:56.994 --> 41:00.129
It's me. It's Flex.

41:00.130 --> 41:01.231
Okay. Memory's back.

41:01.233 --> 41:04.135
- Can we ask him about the Chief now?
- Shut up.

41:04.168 --> 41:06.570
Give them a minute.

41:06.603 --> 41:11.253
I've missed you so much, Dolly.

41:13.244 --> 41:17.547
It's been a long time
since anyone called me Dolly.

41:17.581 --> 41:20.585
Flex?

41:20.617 --> 41:22.487
Flex? Flex!

41:22.518 --> 41:23.755
- It's me, baby.
- Oh, God.

41:23.788 --> 41:28.291
- Oh, God. I thought I lost you.
- It's me, baby.

41:28.326 --> 41:31.429
I'm right here, darling.

41:31.460 --> 41:32.963
I'm right here.

41:32.998 --> 41:36.434
Oh, those people,
they did things to me.

41:36.467 --> 41:40.971
- They made me...
- Baby, me too.

41:41.005 --> 41:42.806
Me too.

41:42.840 --> 41:46.610
It's been so dark without you.

41:46.643 --> 41:50.313
But no matter what they did,

41:50.347 --> 41:52.282
deep down...

41:52.315 --> 41:56.585
I always knew you were there.

41:56.621 --> 41:58.755
That smile...

41:58.789 --> 42:02.726
Oh, how could I forget
that smile?

42:02.760 --> 42:06.463
It's still your best flex.

42:06.496 --> 42:10.467
And you're still
the light of my life.

42:10.501 --> 42:12.670
Oh...

42:12.704 --> 42:14.572
- No. No, no. What's wrong?
- Flex...

42:14.605 --> 42:16.739
- What's wrong? What's wrong?
- I don't feel right.

42:16.773 --> 42:19.009
No, no, no.
It's okay, here, sit down.

42:20.777 --> 42:22.512
No, no, no, no, no.

42:22.547 --> 42:25.983
What's happening?
Dolly, what's happening?

42:26.016 --> 42:29.219
They told me if I ever tried to
find you, I...

42:29.253 --> 42:31.056
No, no, no, no, no!

42:31.088 --> 42:34.056
Dolly, stay with me.
Dolly, stay with me!

42:34.090 --> 42:36.027
Flex, help me.

42:36.061 --> 42:38.163
- Flex...
- Stay with me.

42:38.195 --> 42:40.530
Dolly, stay with me.

42:40.565 --> 42:42.067
Stay with me, Dolly!

42:42.099 --> 42:46.771
Dolly, stay with me.
No, no, no, no.

42:46.804 --> 42:49.907
You're the light of my life.

42:49.940 --> 42:54.940
You're the light
of my life.

43:42.126 --> 43:45.663
So much fuss
over such a small thing.

43:45.697 --> 43:47.831
I can't do it.

43:47.864 --> 43:49.467
You can and you will.

43:49.500 --> 43:50.835
- Rita...
- Victor,

43:50.869 --> 43:55.139
we can't keep running
from Mr. Nobody.

43:55.172 --> 43:58.076
A bully only has power over you
if you give it to him.

43:58.108 --> 44:00.911
- You actually believe that?
- I do.

44:00.945 --> 44:03.114
Every time
we try to help the Chief,

44:03.148 --> 44:06.818
we let our fear
get the best of us.

44:06.851 --> 44:11.556
We owe it to him
to try a bit harder.

44:11.588 --> 44:14.139
We need you, Vic.

44:16.893 --> 44:18.362
It will be all right.

44:18.396 --> 44:21.231
- What if you're wrong?
- I'm not.

44:21.264 --> 44:23.800
You may not trust

44:23.835 --> 44:28.835
your father or yourself,
but you can trust me.

44:35.646 --> 44:40.217
I can't leave him.

44:40.251 --> 44:42.951
I need to be here.

44:48.126 --> 44:53.126
If I do this, you guys are gonna
have to save Niles without me.

44:57.601 --> 44:58.601
Do it.

45:18.222 --> 45:19.722
It's okay.

46:03.601 --> 46:08.371
Well done, Rita.

46:08.405 --> 46:09.440
This episode proved to be

46:09.474 --> 46:13.043
quite the cathartic journey
for you, Ms. Farr.

46:13.077 --> 46:16.047
Looks like
you're finally ready to...

46:16.079 --> 46:21.079
<i>Oh, God. There's more? Ugh!</i>

46:23.554 --> 46:25.690
Hey, uh, Flex?

46:25.722 --> 46:29.159
I'm really sorry
about your wife. I am.

46:29.193 --> 46:31.728
But our friend the Chief...

46:31.762 --> 46:33.731
is in some serious trouble
right now

46:33.764 --> 46:36.101
and if there's...

46:36.134 --> 46:38.202
Cliff.
Something's wrong with Larry.

46:38.235 --> 46:40.605
Larry? Larry.

46:40.637 --> 46:44.443
Jesus. What's happening?

46:44.476 --> 46:48.179
I think nature's
finally taking its course.

46:48.213 --> 46:52.650
I should have died 60 years ago
in that plane crash, but...

46:52.681 --> 46:56.288
The Spirit kept me alive.

46:56.320 --> 46:59.489
Well?
What are you waiting for?

46:59.523 --> 47:03.393
Get the hell back in there.

47:03.427 --> 47:07.331
No. No, don't.

47:07.364 --> 47:09.735
I've been holding you back
long enough, pal.

47:09.768 --> 47:14.338
At least one of us should get to
fly high again, right? Now, go.

47:14.371 --> 47:16.907
- You'll die.
- You can't!

47:16.940 --> 47:19.409
Maybe.

47:19.443 --> 47:20.777
We'll see, I guess.

47:20.813 --> 47:25.047
I'm willing to take a chance
so you can have yours. Please.

47:25.083 --> 47:27.818
Let me do this for you.

47:27.851 --> 47:30.621
Now, go.

47:30.655 --> 47:31.922
Go!

47:31.956 --> 47:35.405
Wait, what? No!

48:13.797 --> 48:15.900
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

48:15.931 --> 48:17.969
Yeah, I think we are.

48:18.001 --> 48:19.902
- We will be.
- Well, good.

48:19.936 --> 48:22.039
Because it's all hands on deck.

48:22.072 --> 48:24.041
Larry, I adore you

48:24.074 --> 48:25.342
and I'm glad you're all right,

48:25.376 --> 48:27.577
but if you get blood
on that carpet, I'll kill you.

48:27.610 --> 48:28.746
Thanks, Rita.

48:28.777 --> 48:29.947
Where's Vic?

48:29.981 --> 48:33.751
With his father,
where he belongs.

48:34.885 --> 48:36.585
I know how to find Niles.

48:36.619 --> 48:38.222
And I don't know about you all,

48:38.255 --> 48:40.757
but I, for one, am ready.

48:40.791 --> 48:41.858
For what?

48:41.893 --> 48:44.393
To fight back.

48:44.427 --> 48:48.699
Care to join me?

48:48.733 --> 48:52.103
Screw it. For Niles.

48:52.235 --> 48:54.637
For Niles.

48:54.672 --> 48:56.873
Yeah.

48:56.907 --> 48:59.143
For Niles.

49:03.447 --> 49:04.981
Finally.

49:05.016 --> 49:09.253
A superhero team
I can actually get behind.

49:09.286 --> 49:10.288
Mmm.

49:10.320 --> 49:14.224
A superhero team
I can actually use.

49:14.259 --> 49:16.960
Took you emo navel-gazers
long enough

49:16.994 --> 49:19.931
to work through your bullshit.

49:19.963 --> 49:23.199
After 13...

49:23.233 --> 49:24.233
Oops.

49:30.641 --> 49:31.775
That's better.

49:31.809 --> 49:34.510
After 13 pointless,

49:34.545 --> 49:35.947
meandering episodes

49:35.980 --> 49:37.648
of character-driven shlock,

49:37.681 --> 49:39.050
we can finally

49:39.083 --> 49:42.585
get to the show that everyone
wanted to see in the first place.

49:42.619 --> 49:45.588
A superhero show!

49:45.623 --> 49:48.525
Right versus Wrong.

49:48.559 --> 49:51.561
Good versus Evil.

49:51.594 --> 49:56.567
Hero versus Villain.

49:56.599 --> 49:57.702
That's me.

50:01.639 --> 50:05.076
You bozos want the Chief?

50:05.108 --> 50:08.478
Come and get him.
