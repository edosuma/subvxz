18:31.067 --> 18:33.567
You okay?

18:35.100 --> 18:37.033
I hurt my ankle.

18:37.033 --> 18:39.067
[ Screams ]

18:44.067 --> 18:46.333
Shut the door!
Hurry!

[ Sticks ]
Wait! Let us in!

18:49.033 --> 18:51.533
Now!

18:54.100 --> 18:58.067
[ Mark ]
Get him, Sticks! Get him! Yeah!

18:58.567 --> 19:02.467
I tried to get them to sleep.
But now they're just all awake again.

19:02.467 --> 19:05.933
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know! I don't know. I gotta think.

19:05.933 --> 19:07.933
[ Panting ]

19:11.300 --> 19:15.667
[ Sighs ]
Okay, they're gone.

19:15.667 --> 19:18.000
- [ Screaming ]
- [ Mark ] No!

19:18.000 --> 19:20.500
- Get it off of me!
- [ Jodie ] Come on, Sticks!

19:20.500 --> 19:23.433
[ Mark ]
Sticks, run!

19:35.400 --> 19:37.000
We can't stop them!
Is there another way out?

19:37.000 --> 19:40.167
No! We're trapped!

19:41.067 --> 19:43.967
Do something, Stanley!

19:44.667 --> 19:47.967
Dad, say the chant!
Make 'em go back to sleep!

19:47.967 --> 19:50.767
They're all coming!
They're all coming for me!

19:51.333 --> 19:53.433
Make them go away!
Don't let them take me!

[ Engine Running ]

20:26.533 --> 20:29.200
Never again.
Never again.

20:29.200 --> 20:31.933
You did it!

20:31.933 --> 20:37.700
Yeah. I guess I got to
ride the thresher after all.

20:40.200 --> 20:43.633
It sure is nice having things
back to normal around here.

20:43.633 --> 20:45.833
You can say that again.

20:47.833 --> 20:51.167
