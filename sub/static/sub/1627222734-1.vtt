02:10.627 --> 02:13.532
I've been selling and collecting
edible hypnotic flowers

02:13.566 --> 02:15.634
for about four years now.

02:15.668 --> 02:17.270
It's pretty wild.

02:22.741 --> 02:24.410
I know some things about them,

02:24.443 --> 02:29.415
but I use trial and error
to test them.

02:29.448 --> 02:31.850
A lot of high-end restaurants
come to me and ask

02:31.883 --> 02:35.787
for a new edible flower
that can give a safe buzz,

02:35.820 --> 02:41.561
which means I basically end up
eating a ton of flowers.

02:46.632 --> 02:49.169
Okay, let's go find
some flowers.

03:02.348 --> 03:05.651
I've only had two complaints.

03:05.683 --> 03:08.820
I think someone's vision
went blurry.

03:08.854 --> 03:11.824
I can't really remember.

03:47.960 --> 03:49.662
That's a sichuan one,

03:49.694 --> 03:51.997
gives you a quick zap.

03:52.031 --> 03:53.932
This is a new one.

03:53.966 --> 03:56.002
It's got a good energy kick
to it.

03:56.034 --> 03:58.003
I call it the Harlem.

03:58.037 --> 04:00.573
And this one,
you can't have too much

04:00.605 --> 04:03.709
because it makes your face
feel kind of weird.

04:03.741 --> 04:06.545
And they're all edible flowers!

04:12.450 --> 04:15.888
I'm not sure if what I do
is entirely legal.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.790
I get approached
by private buyers,

04:18.824 --> 04:20.692
dinner parties I guess.

04:20.725 --> 04:23.762
At the end of the day,
I'm just selling them flowers.

04:23.795 --> 04:25.831
They can do what they want
with them.

04:25.863 --> 04:30.602
Okay, so I'm going to show you
how I test new edible flowers.

04:30.636 --> 04:33.939
I've never tried this one
before, so let's see.

04:52.824 --> 04:54.793
Now we just wait and see!

05:40.505 --> 05:42.875
Marty, uh, Annika's here
with the flowers.

05:42.908 --> 05:45.811
- Hey! How are you?
- What's going on?

05:45.843 --> 05:47.812
- Nice to see you.
- Always good to see you.

05:47.846 --> 05:49.548
- How are you?
- Good, good.

05:49.581 --> 05:51.450
So, flowers,
what do we got today?

05:51.483 --> 05:53.819
I brought some sichuans,
some bluebirds,

05:53.851 --> 05:55.653
some harlems, and stings, so.

05:55.687 --> 05:56.730
- Amazing, let's see 'em.
- Yeah, for sure.

05:56.754 --> 05:58.624
Let's get 'em set up
and see how they look.

05:58.656 --> 06:00.759
I think dining and drinking
are going through

06:00.793 --> 06:03.629
a major transition period
at the moment.

06:03.661 --> 06:06.931
Everyone wants the experience
pushed as far as possible,

06:06.964 --> 06:09.501
so there is more demand
for flowers,

06:09.535 --> 06:12.505
which means
more competition too.

06:15.740 --> 06:17.175
Uh, this is a new one.

06:17.209 --> 06:18.343
It's called the stickler.

06:18.377 --> 06:21.480
It's really awesome,
you should definitely try it.

06:21.512 --> 06:23.983
- Yeah, I'll try it right now.
- Go for it.

06:27.819 --> 06:30.423
All right, let's try this out.

06:30.456 --> 06:32.158
All right, moment of truth.

06:35.194 --> 06:37.997
Okay!
That's actually really good.

06:38.029 --> 06:39.497
Eighteen, nineteen...

06:39.531 --> 06:40.632
Two thousand. Boom.

06:40.665 --> 06:43.002
- Great, thanks so much.
- Thank you, this is awesome.

06:43.035 --> 06:45.079
- I'll see you next week.
- Yeah, you will, I'll be here.

06:45.103 --> 06:46.204
- Okay, bye.
- See ya.

07:33.285 --> 07:37.056
Twenty-eight hundred stings,
twenty-nine hundred dollars.

07:37.088 --> 07:38.557
Are you joking?

07:38.589 --> 07:40.492
The stings are dry,
have no color.

07:40.526 --> 07:41.759
Dry? Excuse me?

07:41.793 --> 07:43.562
They're not dry.

07:43.595 --> 07:45.564
No color?
Now you're being ridiculous.

07:45.596 --> 07:48.567
They are dry, and how
am I supposed to plate up

07:48.600 --> 07:50.937
something that has no color?

07:52.571 --> 07:54.974
Twenty-nine hundred,
thirty-five hundred.

07:55.007 --> 07:57.675
Thirty-five hundred?
Now you're the one who's joking.

07:57.709 --> 08:00.679
- Fine, I'm off to merca.
- Okay.

08:00.711 --> 08:03.182
See if Leo wants my dry flowers.

08:37.649 --> 08:40.586
This is for the delivery
next week.

08:40.619 --> 08:43.621
After that, please do not come
back here again.

08:43.654 --> 08:45.624
- What? Why?
- Why?

08:45.657 --> 08:48.594
Because I want something new,
Annika.

08:48.626 --> 08:51.663
These are everywhere now.

08:51.697 --> 08:55.000
I want something that makes
people have to come here

08:55.033 --> 08:56.936
to drink and party.

08:56.969 --> 08:59.238
Right?

08:59.270 --> 09:00.305
Now please,

09:00.339 --> 09:02.608
leave me alone.

09:04.610 --> 09:05.878
Go!

09:24.796 --> 09:29.068
So, that's all of my deliveries
for restaurants and clubs today.

09:29.100 --> 09:32.605
Now I just have some
private clients to deliver to.

09:34.239 --> 09:37.042
Mm, these are fun.

09:37.075 --> 09:39.745
I make suckers
with edible flowers in them.

09:39.778 --> 09:42.715
They've been really popular,
tasty too.

09:43.649 --> 09:45.250
- Hello.
- Hi!

09:53.658 --> 09:55.827
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Annika.

10:14.379 --> 10:18.783
- Pink.
- P-i-n-k.

10:18.817 --> 10:20.719
- Mm...
- Pick a number.

10:20.751 --> 10:24.022
- Four.
- One, two, three, four.

10:24.056 --> 10:27.393
- Pick another number.
- One.

10:27.426 --> 10:29.995
Your fortune is...

10:30.028 --> 10:32.364
- "You have ten dogs."
- Ten dogs.

10:32.397 --> 10:34.733
- Do you want to do it again?
- Okay.

10:34.765 --> 10:36.968
- Pick a color.
- Red.

10:37.001 --> 10:39.304
This one is a little softer.

10:43.774 --> 10:45.177
That's delicious!

10:45.210 --> 10:46.812
- It's interesting, right?
- Right.

10:46.845 --> 10:49.314
Yeah, it's really nice,
like, as garnishing

10:49.346 --> 10:52.050
or on a salad.

11:35.961 --> 11:38.263
So, hunter and I
work together sometimes.

11:38.296 --> 11:40.899
We're trying to find
this super rare flower.

11:40.932 --> 11:43.769
She calls it work,
but it's, uh, it's more play.

11:43.802 --> 11:44.803
No, it's work.

11:47.471 --> 11:49.741
I work with sports supplements,

11:49.774 --> 11:52.110
a lot of plant-based
protein powders,

11:52.144 --> 11:54.278
but I love plants.

11:54.312 --> 11:56.414
To me...

11:56.447 --> 11:59.050
Finding a rare plant
is like doing a puzzle,

11:59.083 --> 12:03.121
and the plant I want to find
the most is the comet.

12:08.092 --> 12:10.394
There are stories
that if you eat a comet flower,

12:10.427 --> 12:11.596
you can see your future,

12:11.629 --> 12:14.466
and apparently it's worth
a lot of money, told Annika,

12:14.499 --> 12:17.002
that's when she offered
to come aboard and help,

12:17.034 --> 12:18.870
but, uh, yeah, seriously,

12:18.903 --> 12:21.439
it's a really hard flower
to find.

12:21.472 --> 12:23.842
So it's called the comet.

12:44.528 --> 12:47.331
Every bit of information helps.

12:47.365 --> 12:50.335
We just compile
all of our clues,

12:50.368 --> 12:51.970
any information that we find...

12:52.003 --> 12:54.038
You made these.

12:54.072 --> 12:57.341
You made these without me.
These... these were my idea.

12:57.375 --> 12:59.510
Oh, I thought you wanted me
to test them.

12:59.543 --> 13:00.946
No.

13:03.181 --> 13:04.983
Um, so...

13:05.015 --> 13:07.852
Yeah, we just compile
everything that we find

13:07.885 --> 13:09.987
and any clues
that have popped up.

13:10.020 --> 13:12.456
We follow those clues.

13:12.490 --> 13:16.094
I see this as a real elevator
to where our careers can go,

13:16.126 --> 13:18.996
so I think it's worth
a lot of time and energy

13:19.029 --> 13:20.598
to try and find this flower.

13:27.504 --> 13:29.474
Yeah.

13:29.506 --> 13:31.242
Mm-hmm.

13:41.919 --> 13:43.389
Okay, sure.

13:44.889 --> 13:46.357
Yeah.

13:50.195 --> 13:51.497
Okay.

13:57.369 --> 14:02.474
Well, that is another one
of my restaurants gone.

14:02.506 --> 14:04.375
What a shame.

14:07.345 --> 14:08.580
Private buyers are good,

14:08.613 --> 14:11.984
but you need the restaurants
for steady income.

14:12.017 --> 14:15.120
More and more competition
is moving in.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.376
Okay, good.

15:13.110 --> 15:14.679
That's it.

15:31.462 --> 15:33.298
What?

15:33.331 --> 15:35.734
We're done here,
thank you, please.

15:35.767 --> 15:38.403
Good luck with everything.

15:41.505 --> 15:44.576
I found the comet flower.

15:44.609 --> 15:46.677
I wasn't going to tell you,

15:46.711 --> 15:49.380
but I'm breeding them right now.

15:58.423 --> 16:00.993
You bring me that flower...

16:01.025 --> 16:03.060
That flower...

16:03.094 --> 16:05.697
We'll make some serious money.

16:05.730 --> 16:09.134
Not just here,
but with pepi in Vegas

16:09.167 --> 16:10.735
would want it too,

16:10.769 --> 16:14.572
but it's gotta be
the comet flower.

16:14.605 --> 16:17.708
- Pepi would be interested?
- Yes, he would be interested.

16:17.741 --> 16:20.511
He would want it.

16:53.610 --> 16:56.181
Wow, I love it!

17:02.821 --> 17:05.190
This is the new space!

17:12.163 --> 17:14.231
'Cause I had to.

17:14.265 --> 17:16.201
We'll find it soon enough.

18:27.605 --> 18:29.841
Roller skating works
a lot of different muscles.

18:29.874 --> 18:32.644
My therapist says that
I don't do enough fun things,

18:32.676 --> 18:34.411
and this works great.

18:34.444 --> 18:36.548
Really helps me think.

18:44.821 --> 18:47.892
So, big thing for me this year
is actualizing.

18:47.925 --> 18:50.394
I just haven't been actualizing
my goals

18:50.428 --> 18:52.464
or what I want to achieve.

18:52.497 --> 18:54.865
But hard work,
getting things done,

18:54.898 --> 18:56.868
it's all coming together.

19:02.472 --> 19:04.308
And that way,
we can really commit

19:04.342 --> 19:06.645
to finding the comet flower.

19:06.678 --> 19:09.548
This is our chance to elevate.

19:09.580 --> 19:11.782
What if we don't find
the flower though?

19:11.816 --> 19:13.718
Hunter, think positive.

19:13.750 --> 19:15.220
That's how we'll actualize.

19:15.252 --> 19:17.422
How are we gonna pay
for this place?

19:17.454 --> 19:19.523
We split it.

19:19.557 --> 19:21.759
Why have we got this place?

19:21.792 --> 19:24.628
Hunter, stop being negative.

19:24.662 --> 19:28.600
We're a serious business,
and that means an office.

19:28.633 --> 19:32.938
We find the flower
and then grow and stock it here.

19:32.971 --> 19:36.807
Not knowing where the flower is
puts a lot of pressure on us.

19:36.840 --> 19:38.976
Oh, come on.

19:39.009 --> 19:42.379
It's going to be so much fun.

19:42.413 --> 19:43.748
See, look.

19:43.780 --> 19:46.650
This is where we do work stuff.

19:46.683 --> 19:49.954
Just imagine, look,
doing business.

19:49.988 --> 19:51.823
"Oh my god,
there are so many orders!

19:51.855 --> 19:52.923
Hunter, oh my god!"

19:52.957 --> 19:54.492
And then, over here,

19:54.525 --> 19:57.229
we can, um,
we can grow the plants.

19:57.261 --> 19:58.395
Look, look, look, look.

19:58.429 --> 20:00.232
I'm a plant, and I'm growing.

20:00.265 --> 20:01.766
Oh my god,
there are so many of us.

20:01.798 --> 20:04.868
And then, over here,
we can, um...

20:04.902 --> 20:07.605
Like... I don't know
what to do over there yet,

20:07.638 --> 20:08.606
but you gotta...

20:08.640 --> 20:10.575
You should've asked me first.

20:10.607 --> 20:13.377
Hunter, do you want to start
a successful business

20:13.411 --> 20:15.846
or keep cleaning toilets
for the rest of your life?

20:15.880 --> 20:16.982
I don't clean toilets.

20:17.015 --> 20:18.650
I don't know why
you always say that.

20:18.682 --> 20:21.286
Look, I know the market.

20:21.318 --> 20:22.686
Whoever finds this thing

20:22.720 --> 20:25.624
is going to have a license
to print money.

20:25.656 --> 20:27.791
I want that to be you...

20:27.825 --> 20:28.926
And me.

20:28.960 --> 20:31.462
Come on, you've always wanted
to find this thing.

20:31.496 --> 20:32.697
- No.
- Come on, hunter!

20:32.730 --> 20:35.299
- No, it's not happening, stop.
- Come on, hunter, come on!

21:00.991 --> 21:04.628
We can go to the forest
on Wednesday.

21:04.662 --> 21:06.465
Or maybe even tomorrow?

21:10.999 --> 21:13.305
There's a lot of information
about the comet flower

21:13.337 --> 21:15.807
that we don't know
whether it's true or not.

21:15.839 --> 21:19.343
Like this one says,
"looks like a comet,"

21:19.376 --> 21:21.378
which makes sense.

21:21.412 --> 21:25.583
"When the comet flower blooms,
it smells like fire."

21:25.615 --> 21:27.786
I hope that one's true.

21:27.818 --> 21:30.020
So, yeah, we've got
a bunch of leads,

21:30.054 --> 21:32.557
uh, so we're just gonna check
each one out

21:32.589 --> 21:35.626
and hopefully find
this comet flower.

21:52.542 --> 21:55.346
Do you have a comet flower?

21:55.380 --> 21:56.748
- Cauliflower?
- Comet.

21:56.780 --> 21:58.115
- No, no.
- No?

22:39.557 --> 22:40.557
Hi!

22:40.590 --> 22:41.892
Do you have this flower?

22:41.925 --> 22:43.427
It's called the comet flower?

23:43.019 --> 23:45.056
We're having a little bit
of trouble finding

23:45.088 --> 23:47.458
the comet flower.

23:47.491 --> 23:49.027
We'll get there though.

23:49.059 --> 23:51.596
Just have to stay positive.

24:27.964 --> 24:29.199
Okay, everybody together.

24:29.232 --> 24:30.768
- Here am I.
- Here am I.

24:30.800 --> 24:32.035
Own it, be in it.

24:32.068 --> 24:33.738
- Here am I!
- Here am I!

24:33.770 --> 24:35.272
You're overthinking everything.

24:35.306 --> 24:38.242
What are you overthinking
in particular?

24:38.276 --> 24:40.812
- Where I'm at with my life.
- Where you are?

24:40.845 --> 24:43.081
So be where you are

24:43.114 --> 24:45.983
to get where you're going, yeah?

24:46.017 --> 24:47.818
Louder, come on, find it!

24:47.852 --> 24:49.854
Find it, find it!

24:54.224 --> 24:57.895
The ways in which you live
in me, mother, are...

24:57.929 --> 25:00.832
The ways in which
you live in me, mother,

25:00.865 --> 25:05.236
are how kind and loving
I am towards others.

25:05.269 --> 25:06.270
Nice.

25:07.704 --> 25:10.274
Who has your back?

25:10.307 --> 25:15.212
What sense of universal context
has your back?

25:16.314 --> 25:19.817
My greatest fear is...

25:19.849 --> 25:21.752
That I'm gonna be alone.

25:25.256 --> 25:27.325
Just send her energy.

25:27.357 --> 25:30.161
No words necessary.

25:42.073 --> 25:44.809
What are you feeling?
What are you feeling?

25:44.842 --> 25:47.711
Hello, I am asking you
a question.

25:47.744 --> 25:50.948
- I don't know.
- What are you feeling, Annika?

25:50.981 --> 25:53.651
You do know.

25:53.683 --> 25:56.820
I... I don't know
what else to say, Annika.

25:56.854 --> 25:59.057
I've said it over
and over again.

25:59.089 --> 26:01.259
Life is calling to you,

26:01.291 --> 26:04.361
and until you decide to answer,

26:04.394 --> 26:06.964
there's nothing more to be said.

26:24.914 --> 26:27.184
So, some good news.

26:27.218 --> 26:31.322
We got a tip that a comet plant
was spotted in lake arrowhead,

26:31.355 --> 26:34.224
so we're gonna go check it out.

26:52.942 --> 26:54.912
Maybe should try over here.

26:54.944 --> 26:56.246
Okay.

27:36.319 --> 27:39.790
I think we should look,
uh, back through there.

27:39.824 --> 27:40.925
Okay.

27:40.958 --> 27:42.727
Yeah, I got a good feeling.

27:42.759 --> 27:45.363
I think we could...
We could do this.

28:44.355 --> 28:46.758
Have we searched pine valley?

28:46.790 --> 28:49.159
Yeah, we went there
on the third day, I think.

28:49.192 --> 28:52.262
Yeah, yeah, we did, we did.

28:52.296 --> 28:54.865
And what about Reese creek,
did we look there?

28:54.898 --> 28:56.767
Yeah, we've been there too.

29:01.538 --> 29:04.541
We've tried a lot of places now.

29:04.575 --> 29:07.378
I think it'd be a good idea
to come up with a backup plan,

29:07.411 --> 29:11.849
but Annika gets pretty stubborn.

29:32.502 --> 29:36.406
Running out of time,
running out of money.

29:36.440 --> 29:38.375
Gotta get this flower.

30:11.608 --> 30:13.577
Trying to see
if there is anywhere else

30:13.611 --> 30:15.980
to look for the comet flower.

30:47.577 --> 30:50.914
These are great
for keeping you awake.

30:50.948 --> 30:54.085
Kind of similar to guarana.

31:00.990 --> 31:03.094
It's Reggie.

31:03.126 --> 31:06.396
This guy does not let up.

31:18.308 --> 31:20.478
Sorry I'm late,
they held me back for a meeting.

31:20.510 --> 31:23.013
I think I found someone
who owns comet flowers.

31:23.047 --> 31:24.915
- Have you been here all night?
- Yeah.

31:24.949 --> 31:27.151
- Have you slept?
- Yeah.

31:28.352 --> 31:29.954
How'd you find that out?

31:29.987 --> 31:31.689
From this old interview.

31:31.721 --> 31:34.090
- That take long?
- Not too long.

31:34.124 --> 31:36.192
This guy describes
"eating a flower

31:36.226 --> 31:38.996
that made me meet myself
in 20 years.

31:39.028 --> 31:43.200
The most amazing experience
of my life."

31:43.232 --> 31:45.135
Could be the comet.

31:45.169 --> 31:46.371
Of course it is.

32:06.423 --> 32:08.358
So the woman
who owns comet flower

32:08.392 --> 32:10.628
should be in that place
over there.

32:43.794 --> 32:45.363
- Hello there, ma'am.
- Hi.

32:45.395 --> 32:46.696
Uh, my name's Louise,

32:46.730 --> 32:50.367
and this is
my business associate, Mr. Lily.

32:50.401 --> 32:52.403
We have been informed
that there was

32:52.435 --> 32:55.138
a very special plant
that grew here.

32:59.108 --> 33:01.412
Well, she didn't know anything
about the comet flower

33:01.444 --> 33:03.179
and says it never grew there.

33:03.212 --> 33:07.218
Yeah, she says she doesn't know,
but I think she's lying.

33:07.250 --> 33:08.385
What are you doing?

33:08.419 --> 33:09.420
Shush!

33:09.452 --> 33:11.489
Why are you doing push-ups?

33:12.823 --> 33:14.592
Helps me think.

33:18.761 --> 33:21.331
Excuse me, have you seen these
flowers that grow around here?

33:21.365 --> 33:23.534
I think they're like blue
and called the comet flower?

33:23.567 --> 33:25.603
No, sorry.

33:33.343 --> 33:36.279
You have been avoiding me.

33:36.313 --> 33:38.449
Just been busy, reg.
I'm a busy girl.

33:38.481 --> 33:39.616
What's happening?

33:39.650 --> 33:44.221
You said you already had
the stuff, so what's happening?

33:44.253 --> 33:47.057
- Hello?
- Yes, yes, they're coming.

33:47.090 --> 33:49.492
Well, hurry up, I've got
other suppliers, you know.

33:49.526 --> 33:50.594
Yes, I do.

33:50.626 --> 33:52.462
The flowers are coming.

34:01.538 --> 34:06.076
It's all about getting the ratio
of mustard to ketchup right.

34:06.109 --> 34:08.679
See, he's over-mustardized.

34:08.710 --> 34:10.648
Tastes really good though.

34:13.583 --> 34:16.753
I still think
that woman's lying.

34:16.786 --> 34:20.556
She's got our comets.

34:20.590 --> 34:23.161
Don't do anything stupid.

34:39.175 --> 34:42.413
I know that woman we visited
has comet plants.

34:42.445 --> 34:44.248
I just know it.

34:53.891 --> 34:56.460
I've got an idea.

35:03.567 --> 35:05.302
I don't usually wear black,

35:05.335 --> 35:07.271
but this is pretty cool.

35:07.304 --> 35:08.672
Check out this beanie.

35:08.704 --> 35:11.307
Never get to wear beanies in la.

35:14.710 --> 35:17.213
I don't really know
how to use these.

35:18.581 --> 35:20.717
They say fortune
favors the bold.

36:10.333 --> 36:11.902
Round two.

36:32.255 --> 36:33.923
Mission accomplished.

36:35.659 --> 36:37.927
I knew that lady was lying.

36:37.960 --> 36:40.263
What a devious character.

36:47.336 --> 36:49.340
These are comet flowers.

36:49.373 --> 36:50.974
Aren't they great?

36:51.007 --> 36:52.942
How did you get them?

36:52.976 --> 36:55.945
Uh, I went back to the mountains
where I told you we should've...

36:55.978 --> 36:58.314
That's not true, you didn't.

36:58.347 --> 37:00.317
Where'd you get them from?

37:00.349 --> 37:01.861
I went back to the mountains
where I told you...

37:01.885 --> 37:04.655
No, you obviously stole them.
You stole them from that woman!

37:04.688 --> 37:08.525
- I didn't steal them, hunter.
- This is nuts!

37:08.557 --> 37:12.528
Look, we have the flowers
and we're running out of money,

37:12.561 --> 37:14.397
so we need to sell them soon.

37:14.431 --> 37:15.798
No, this is really stupid,

37:15.831 --> 37:18.402
and as per usual,
you didn't ask me.

37:26.943 --> 37:28.579
He'll be fine.

37:56.572 --> 37:59.777
It's pretty amazing
to see them in real life.

38:01.777 --> 38:05.015
I never thought I'd ever
see them, you know, ever.

38:16.525 --> 38:19.762
Okay, so now we're going
to test the comet flower,

38:19.795 --> 38:21.998
and by we, I mean me,

38:22.032 --> 38:23.901
and by test, I mean...

38:23.934 --> 38:25.969
I have to eat one
of these suckers.

38:26.001 --> 38:29.706
Hopefully it shows me my future
and not the hospital.

38:43.519 --> 38:46.023
Gosh, it's bitter.

39:04.074 --> 39:07.543
Well, that was not tasty.

39:07.577 --> 39:09.814
Now we just wait and see.

39:16.152 --> 39:18.121
Do you feel anything?

39:18.155 --> 39:20.524
No.

39:20.556 --> 39:22.359
Yes!

39:32.969 --> 39:35.105
I'm not really
a Porsche kind of guy,

39:35.137 --> 39:40.643
but, you know, it's a cool car
so I took the picture.

39:40.677 --> 39:42.646
Is the flower
doing anything yet?

39:42.679 --> 39:44.514
Not really.

39:51.454 --> 39:53.423
It has to be
the same flower, right?

39:53.456 --> 39:56.692
I mean, it's all there.

39:56.726 --> 40:00.431
It's definitely the same flower.

40:00.463 --> 40:02.932
I don't know why
it isn't working.

40:23.519 --> 40:25.956
I think the flower's working.

40:55.952 --> 40:57.555
Are you okay?

41:00.123 --> 41:02.726
What's happening,
what are you seeing?

41:03.960 --> 41:05.929
Annika, what's going on?

41:35.958 --> 41:37.927
Take me to the beach.

42:17.733 --> 42:20.770
Seriously, I've eaten
so many goddamn flowers,

42:20.804 --> 42:23.606
and that was, like...

42:23.639 --> 42:25.975
Fucking amazing.

42:26.009 --> 42:28.177
What'd you see?

42:28.210 --> 42:30.746
What happened?

42:30.780 --> 42:31.915
Can't say.

42:31.947 --> 42:33.182
Tell me.

42:35.818 --> 42:37.721
So it works?

42:37.753 --> 42:39.322
It fully works?

42:39.356 --> 42:43.260
We gotta breed as many
of these things as possible.

42:43.293 --> 42:46.063
This thing is going
to change lives...

42:46.096 --> 42:47.731
And print money.

42:47.764 --> 42:49.599
Lots of money.

43:24.367 --> 43:26.937
So, now hunter's going
to do his thing

43:26.969 --> 43:28.904
and breed the comet plants.

43:28.938 --> 43:32.309
It's a little intricate
at times, but whatever.

43:32.342 --> 43:35.177
Then we can get these bad boys
off to Reggie

43:35.210 --> 43:36.846
and start making some profit.

44:19.789 --> 44:22.125
So, we've just bred
the comet flower.

44:22.157 --> 44:25.795
Now hopefully it doesn't take
too long for them to grow.

44:52.155 --> 44:55.325
I used to tan really well
when I was a kid.

44:55.358 --> 44:57.461
I don't know why,
but I've lost a little bit

44:57.494 --> 45:00.997
of my olive complexion.

45:01.030 --> 45:06.002
There's nothing else to do
around here at the moment.

45:06.034 --> 45:09.873
Why won't these plants
just hurry up and grow?

45:09.905 --> 45:13.443
No comet plants,
no comet flowers.

45:17.280 --> 45:19.483
Can one of you spray my back?

45:38.101 --> 45:39.869
While waiting for the comets,

45:39.902 --> 45:43.305
I've wired up all these plants
to speakers.

45:43.338 --> 45:47.043
I'm... getting
their electronic impulses

45:47.076 --> 45:49.813
and, in real time,
turning them into music.

45:49.846 --> 45:55.052
So, basically, I'm playing them
like instruments.

46:24.179 --> 46:27.817
So I don't know what it is,
but they're just not growing.

46:27.851 --> 46:30.519
We've tried everything.

46:30.552 --> 46:32.955
It's just not happening.

46:32.989 --> 46:34.490
I mean, hopefully,
we have better luck

46:34.523 --> 46:36.092
with the next bunch
of seedlings,

46:36.125 --> 46:39.563
but this has
never happened before.

46:51.608 --> 46:52.609
Oh, I left my phone.

46:52.641 --> 46:54.443
Let me just get my phone.

47:39.621 --> 47:41.324
Do you wanna get a beer tonight?

47:41.356 --> 47:44.561
Uh, I think I'm just gonna go
and get some work done.

47:44.594 --> 47:47.063
- Sure.
- All right, see you tomorrow!

47:47.096 --> 47:48.998
See you tomorrow.

48:40.215 --> 48:43.719
I am successful
in all areas of my life

48:43.753 --> 48:48.091
and every day in every way,
I am getting stronger.

49:02.672 --> 49:04.440
Can't hurt, right?

49:04.474 --> 49:08.144
God, at this point, you need
to be trying everything.

49:44.547 --> 49:46.715
Why aren't they growing?

49:46.748 --> 49:49.084
I don't know.

49:49.117 --> 49:53.556
- Okay, we can fix this.
- But there are no plants.

49:53.588 --> 49:55.525
- Correct.
- So what's there to fix?

49:55.557 --> 49:57.494
Positivity, hunter!

50:02.398 --> 50:05.135
Maybe they can't be bred
in captivity.

50:11.074 --> 50:15.278
There are no new flowers,
no new plants.

50:15.311 --> 50:16.246
This is really bad,

50:16.278 --> 50:18.581
we were supposed to be
selling them by now.

50:20.416 --> 50:21.526
You know, I don't know
how we can go on,

50:21.550 --> 50:24.153
there's no money.

50:24.186 --> 50:26.722
- Where are you going?
- I have to think.

50:26.755 --> 50:29.192
Can't just sit here
and do nothing.

51:25.681 --> 51:27.449
Reggie is on my back,

51:27.483 --> 51:29.285
and if I don't get the comets,

51:29.318 --> 51:32.622
there goes a huge opportunity.

51:32.655 --> 51:34.691
But there are no flowers.

51:34.724 --> 51:37.094
No flowers.

51:54.911 --> 51:56.412
This is all the stock
we have left

51:56.445 --> 51:59.182
from the original plants.

51:59.215 --> 52:01.718
Not nearly enough.

52:50.565 --> 52:52.234
I know what to do.

54:16.085 --> 54:18.054
What the hell are these?

54:18.086 --> 54:19.597
What do you mean?
They're comet flowers.

54:19.621 --> 54:21.723
What the hell are these?

54:21.757 --> 54:23.326
- These...
- What are you doing?

54:23.358 --> 54:26.828
I trust you, every time you...
What are you doing?

54:26.862 --> 54:28.798
- These are the flowers...
- Get out, get out.

54:28.831 --> 54:32.001
No, get out.

54:32.034 --> 54:34.637
Go, out, we're done.

54:34.670 --> 54:36.972
We are done.

54:37.005 --> 54:38.574
We're done.

54:38.606 --> 54:42.679
I never wanna ever,
ever see you again.

54:42.711 --> 54:44.313
I don't want
to ever see you again,

54:44.347 --> 54:46.615
get out, go.

54:46.648 --> 54:48.884
Go.

54:48.918 --> 54:50.920
Go!

55:28.923 --> 55:30.559
What's wrong?

55:34.096 --> 55:35.697
Since when is it okay
to take property

55:35.731 --> 55:39.936
that's equally mine
and do what you want with it?

55:39.969 --> 55:42.771
Hey, it's not like I stole them.

55:42.804 --> 55:45.073
- I tried to sell them.
- What are those flowers?

55:45.106 --> 55:47.376
I've been mucking around
with the stock a little.

55:47.409 --> 55:51.114
Okay, a lot, but they're
completely harmless.

55:51.146 --> 55:52.481
I just used food dye

55:52.514 --> 55:53.925
to make them look similar
to the comets

55:53.949 --> 55:57.052
and mixed them in
with the others.

55:57.085 --> 55:58.954
So how's this gonna work?

55:58.987 --> 56:00.623
We sell online.

56:00.655 --> 56:02.458
Forget bars and restaurants,

56:02.490 --> 56:04.559
we'll create our own network.

56:04.592 --> 56:08.130
With flowers that have no effect
when you eat them?

56:08.164 --> 56:11.368
Hey, every third flower or so
will be real.

56:17.505 --> 56:22.045
- Are they safe?
- Completely, 100% safe.

56:26.681 --> 56:28.116
Come on, we've run out of money!

56:28.150 --> 56:30.019
We need to decide now.

57:18.701 --> 57:20.936
I know
I'm a pretty driven person,

57:20.969 --> 57:24.606
but there are just some things
that I really want.

57:27.576 --> 57:30.746
This is the new website,
edibleflowers.Com.

57:30.778 --> 57:32.581
Should be super easy to use,

57:32.614 --> 57:35.884
and I'm hoping
we have a good launch.

57:38.586 --> 57:41.523
So, you want them delivered
by the 15th?

57:42.557 --> 57:45.094
Yeah, we can do that!

57:45.126 --> 57:48.530
Perfect! I've got it all set.

57:48.563 --> 57:49.865
Okay, thank you so much!

57:49.898 --> 57:51.867
Okay, bye!

57:53.735 --> 57:54.912
Hello, you've reached
edible flowers.

57:54.936 --> 57:57.873
This is Annika speaking.

57:57.907 --> 57:59.642
Hi!

57:59.675 --> 58:03.846
Five comets, five sichuan?

58:03.878 --> 58:05.947
Definitely.

58:05.981 --> 58:07.124
Hello, you've reached
edible flowers.

58:07.148 --> 58:09.684
This is Annika speaking.

58:09.717 --> 58:11.553
Oh, hi, I just lost you.

58:11.586 --> 58:13.021
So, just give me your address.

58:28.036 --> 58:30.672
Don't shoot from that angle!

58:30.706 --> 58:32.909
Always shoot down!

58:38.146 --> 58:40.583
- How's the lighting?
- It's good.

58:40.615 --> 58:43.585
- My eyes reading?
- I think so.

58:43.619 --> 58:45.288
They better be.

59:04.139 --> 59:07.710
But you haven't gone
to a doctor.

59:07.742 --> 59:09.744
Okay, good,
'cause if it's only one ear,

59:09.777 --> 59:12.581
then it's not that bad.

59:12.614 --> 59:16.351
Look, this flower
doesn't gel with everyone.

59:16.385 --> 59:19.622
A refund? How would that work?

59:23.192 --> 59:25.860
Okay, look,
I'm sorry if you think

59:25.893 --> 59:27.162
the flower made you sick,

59:27.195 --> 59:29.030
but to be honest,
we can't be entirely sure

59:29.063 --> 59:31.733
that that's what caused
your loss of hearing.

59:38.673 --> 59:39.708
Who were you talking to?

59:39.742 --> 59:42.244
- When?
- Now, on the phone.

59:42.277 --> 59:45.048
My gas got turned off
in my apartment.

59:48.349 --> 59:51.286
These will be perfect
for the website.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.901
These customers complaining

01:00:05.934 --> 01:00:08.338
think they're empties
or something.

01:00:10.239 --> 01:00:13.074
Excuse me, sir.

01:00:13.108 --> 01:00:15.177
I'm asking,
after you ate the flower,

01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:17.347
how long did the nausea last?

01:00:18.981 --> 01:00:20.383
A whole three days?

01:00:30.793 --> 01:00:32.403
I think we need
some more positive reviews

01:00:32.427 --> 01:00:35.096
than the ones we're getting.

01:00:35.130 --> 01:00:37.199
I'm going to post
a few fake ones

01:00:37.231 --> 01:00:40.268
about the comet flower online.

01:00:40.302 --> 01:00:43.673
Perception is everything.

01:01:09.831 --> 01:01:12.167
What time does
the delivery guy get here?

01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:16.038
Uhh, not for a few hours.

01:01:16.070 --> 01:01:17.373
You can go if you want.

01:01:17.405 --> 01:01:20.108
No way, we can chill.

01:01:20.141 --> 01:01:22.444
It's been nonstop around here.

01:01:26.514 --> 01:01:28.416
Pay day.

01:02:19.467 --> 01:02:23.105
Best hangover cure:

01:02:23.137 --> 01:02:24.740
Flowers.

01:02:28.376 --> 01:02:31.179
Moondust is the bomb.

01:02:32.447 --> 01:02:34.450
Do they get it from the moon?

01:02:36.552 --> 01:02:39.521
"Made in Pasadena."

01:02:39.554 --> 01:02:40.789
Guess not.

01:03:34.476 --> 01:03:36.045
Uh, no.

01:03:41.282 --> 01:03:42.985
What complaints?

01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:49.992
How do you know that?

01:03:58.567 --> 01:04:00.603
No, I don't think so.

01:04:37.338 --> 01:04:39.375
Just so you know,
I called the health authorities

01:04:39.407 --> 01:04:41.610
and told them everything.

01:04:43.311 --> 01:04:45.313
I can't keep doing this.

01:05:44.706 --> 01:05:47.977
Well, you and your so-called
health department

01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:50.479
have nothing to do with this.

01:05:50.512 --> 01:05:51.981
I'm just selling them flowers,

01:05:52.014 --> 01:05:55.217
they can do
what they want with them.

01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:58.019
Well, who told you this?

01:05:58.052 --> 01:05:59.587
Well, I wanna know.

01:06:02.289 --> 01:06:04.293
Well, just so you know, sir,

01:06:04.326 --> 01:06:06.394
you and your so-called
health department

01:06:06.427 --> 01:06:08.163
are now squashing me,

01:06:08.195 --> 01:06:10.264
and I'm a small business owner,

01:06:10.297 --> 01:06:13.301
so I'm gonna fight this.

01:06:13.335 --> 01:06:15.471
Hunter, that weasel!

01:07:19.701 --> 01:07:25.474
"Cease all operations
effective immediately"?

01:07:25.507 --> 01:07:27.476
Yeah, we'll see about that.

01:07:34.349 --> 01:07:35.349
Shit.

01:07:48.563 --> 01:07:52.134
This is probably another
complaining customer.

01:07:52.166 --> 01:07:54.335
This thing does not stop.

01:07:57.806 --> 01:08:00.175
Hello, Annika speaking.

01:08:03.744 --> 01:08:07.583
But we never say
that you should eat them.

01:08:07.615 --> 01:08:10.619
Well, it's up to you
what you do with the flowers.

01:08:37.712 --> 01:08:40.349
The moonflower,

01:08:40.381 --> 01:08:43.152
it's a little early for them
to be in bloom,

01:08:43.185 --> 01:08:45.621
but here it is.

01:08:45.654 --> 01:08:49.258
You can just see it glow
if you look close enough.

01:09:41.509 --> 01:09:43.345
Look, it's fine.

01:09:43.377 --> 01:09:44.912
- All good?
- Yeah, I mean,

01:09:44.944 --> 01:09:46.747
you should be okay.

01:09:46.779 --> 01:09:49.318
We'll close up shop
and you'll be absolutely fine.

01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:50.484
I have to close?

01:09:50.518 --> 01:09:53.386
Oh, definitely, definitely.

01:09:53.421 --> 01:09:54.531
But at this stage,
you'll be in the clear

01:09:54.555 --> 01:09:57.992
with any legal implications.

01:09:58.025 --> 01:10:00.929
But I need to keep going.

01:10:00.962 --> 01:10:04.200
Well, you can't.

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:07.769
Pay the fine, move on.

01:10:07.801 --> 01:10:09.403
I'm not sure if I told you,

01:10:09.436 --> 01:10:11.539
but I'm supposed to be
actualizing.

01:10:11.573 --> 01:10:13.008
You'll be okay!

01:10:13.041 --> 01:10:15.244
You'll bounce back.

01:10:15.277 --> 01:10:19.814
My advice is to cash out,
go back to what you were doing,

01:10:19.847 --> 01:10:22.417
and regroup.

01:10:22.449 --> 01:10:24.920
Maybe you need a vacation.

01:11:04.759 --> 01:11:09.363
So, today's the last day,
but the first day.

01:11:09.396 --> 01:11:11.065
You know?

01:11:11.099 --> 01:11:13.534
I am going to get back in touch
with some former clients,

01:11:13.568 --> 01:11:16.070
so still not taking
a backwards step.

01:11:16.104 --> 01:11:18.374
Always moving forward.

01:11:22.877 --> 01:11:25.080
Um...

01:11:25.113 --> 01:11:28.784
You know, with hunter, I...

01:11:28.817 --> 01:11:30.519
I guess we just went
our separate ways

01:11:30.551 --> 01:11:33.587
and that's probably
a good thing.

01:11:33.621 --> 01:11:35.391
I wish him the best.

01:11:36.957 --> 01:11:38.626
Hunter?

01:11:38.659 --> 01:11:41.028
No.

01:11:41.061 --> 01:11:43.765
No, that's just how he is.

01:11:45.966 --> 01:11:47.869
Yeah.

01:12:41.655 --> 01:12:42.791
- Hey.
- Hey!

01:12:42.823 --> 01:12:44.492
- How are ya?
- I'm good, how are you?

01:12:44.525 --> 01:12:45.603
Good, it's good
to see you again.

01:12:45.627 --> 01:12:47.396
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:47.429 --> 01:12:49.431
I'm so sorry,
I've been out of town

01:12:49.463 --> 01:12:52.000
and I was working
on this other project,

01:12:52.033 --> 01:12:56.137
and anyway, I am back
to selling flowers,

01:12:56.171 --> 01:13:01.510
and I was just seeing
if you guys still needed me.

01:13:01.542 --> 01:13:03.811
- Sure.
- Yeah, I have a ton of stock.

01:13:03.845 --> 01:13:06.114
I have some really great stuff
at the moment,

01:13:06.146 --> 01:13:07.586
and I'm happy
to give you a discount.

01:13:07.614 --> 01:13:08.750
That's great.

01:13:08.783 --> 01:13:10.552
I mean, we're glad
to have you back,

01:13:10.585 --> 01:13:12.988
but in the time being
when you were gone,

01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:14.564
we found another supplier,
'cause you know,

01:13:14.588 --> 01:13:16.056
- we needed stuff coming in.
- Right.

01:13:16.090 --> 01:13:17.567
And you know,
it wouldn't really be fair

01:13:17.591 --> 01:13:18.993
to kind of just cut her out,

01:13:19.027 --> 01:13:20.862
so we're gonna stick
with that for now.

01:13:20.895 --> 01:13:23.999
Okay. Do you have a contract?

01:13:24.032 --> 01:13:26.134
Yeah, yeah, you know,
we got a good agreement

01:13:26.167 --> 01:13:27.636
and a good deal
going on right now,

01:13:27.668 --> 01:13:29.537
so we're just gonna see
how that goes.

01:13:29.570 --> 01:13:30.682
- But you know...
- Okay, well, I'm happy to offer

01:13:30.706 --> 01:13:33.475
a competitive price,
or if there's something else.

01:13:33.507 --> 01:13:34.943
Sure, how about this?

01:13:34.975 --> 01:13:36.444
We'll let you know

01:13:36.478 --> 01:13:38.646
if we need anything from you
moving forward,

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:39.857
- we'll give you a call.
- Okay.

01:13:39.881 --> 01:13:42.751
But for now it's just,
you know, we love seeing you,

01:13:42.783 --> 01:13:45.786
so always pop in,
and we'll just...

01:13:45.819 --> 01:13:47.588
- We'll go from there.
- Okay, great.

01:13:47.622 --> 01:13:48.722
- Cool.
- Cool.

01:13:48.756 --> 01:13:50.592
- It's great to see you.
- Okay, bye.

01:15:32.594 --> 01:15:34.096
Oh, okay.

01:15:36.163 --> 01:15:39.800
Yeah, well,
I'm happy to offer you

01:15:39.833 --> 01:15:41.836
a competitive price.

01:15:44.838 --> 01:15:47.108
Sure.

01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:52.079
Okay, well,
if you change your mind...

01:15:53.347 --> 01:15:55.283
Okay.

01:15:55.315 --> 01:15:56.952
Bye.

01:16:43.698 --> 01:16:46.234
Okay, let's go
sell some flowers!

01:17:04.252 --> 01:17:05.754
- Annika, hi!
- Hi!

01:17:05.787 --> 01:17:07.021
- How are you?
- Come in!

01:17:07.055 --> 01:17:09.724
I'm so happy to see you!

01:17:09.756 --> 01:17:11.091
Come in.

01:17:12.359 --> 01:17:14.895
Using your breath,

01:17:14.929 --> 01:17:17.032
reach down, grab any heavy,
dense energy,

01:17:17.064 --> 01:17:19.333
let it go.

01:17:19.367 --> 01:17:21.703
Just breathe in and breathe out.

01:17:24.838 --> 01:17:26.841
Chest-belly breathing.

01:17:30.177 --> 01:17:32.413
Allow yourself to let go.

01:17:34.215 --> 01:17:36.451
Any tension, any stress,

01:17:36.484 --> 01:17:40.122
any contraction
inside your body.

01:17:42.222 --> 01:17:44.359
Letting go.

01:18:02.342 --> 01:18:06.213
Take a deep breath,
inhale, let it go.

01:18:07.481 --> 01:18:09.117
Ahh.

01:18:09.149 --> 01:18:11.418
Inhale.

01:18:11.452 --> 01:18:13.221
And release.

01:18:16.858 --> 01:18:20.494
And I wanted to show you
this one that I found as well.

01:18:20.528 --> 01:18:21.671
- All right.
- It's a little bit

01:18:21.695 --> 01:18:24.466
more expensive than the others,
but it's really great.

01:18:24.498 --> 01:18:26.000
You should definitely try it.

01:18:26.033 --> 01:18:27.869
- Okay.
- Everyone's been loving it.

01:18:27.902 --> 01:18:29.436
What do you serve it with?

01:18:29.470 --> 01:18:31.873
You can just do it on its own.

01:18:31.905 --> 01:18:34.943
That's kind of
how everyone does it, so...

01:18:34.975 --> 01:18:36.320
- Okay.
- That's how I'd recommend it.

01:18:36.344 --> 01:18:37.487
- I'll take it.
- Okay, great!

01:18:37.511 --> 01:18:39.113
That one is an extra 40,

01:18:39.146 --> 01:18:42.216
so this here
that you've got is 60,

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:44.385
so it's 100 altogether.

01:18:44.417 --> 01:18:46.320
- A hundred altogether.
- Uh-huh.

01:18:46.354 --> 01:18:48.021
Is it possible to get a discount

01:18:48.055 --> 01:18:49.990
or can I pay you some later?

01:18:50.024 --> 01:18:51.192
Uh, sure!

01:18:51.225 --> 01:18:53.361
- Maybe next time?
- Yeah.

01:18:53.394 --> 01:18:54.505
Can you put it
on my bill next time?

01:18:54.529 --> 01:18:55.830
- Sure.
- Okay.

01:18:55.863 --> 01:18:58.967
Um, here's 55.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.435
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:19:01.469 --> 01:19:02.971
- Is that all right?
- Mhm.

01:19:03.003 --> 01:19:04.439
Okay.

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:08.518
Do you want the harlems,
is that you?

01:19:08.542 --> 01:19:11.112
- Yeah, yeah.
- Awesome.

01:19:11.145 --> 01:19:13.882
I've got three for you.

01:19:13.914 --> 01:19:15.082
- Great.
- Awesome.

01:19:15.115 --> 01:19:17.385
- Thank you!
- Yeah, have a good one.

01:21:08.261 --> 01:21:10.164
Oh, man.

01:22:30.344 --> 01:22:32.713
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:22:32.747 --> 01:22:35.650
- Thanks for meeting me.
- It's okay.

01:22:35.682 --> 01:22:37.318
I've only got
a few minutes, though.

01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:39.353
Okay, so, um...

01:22:42.288 --> 01:22:44.559
I just want to say
that I'm really sorry

01:22:44.591 --> 01:22:47.394
for everything that happened.

01:22:47.427 --> 01:22:49.965
I shouldn't have
treated you like that.

01:22:52.733 --> 01:22:55.170
My plants died.

01:22:56.636 --> 01:22:58.605
I did that.

01:22:58.639 --> 01:23:00.442
I poisoned them.

01:23:04.712 --> 01:23:07.248
And I brought you this.

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:09.417
What's that for?

01:23:09.449 --> 01:23:10.717
You earned it.

01:23:10.751 --> 01:23:13.287
Why?

01:23:13.319 --> 01:23:15.556
For everything you did for me.

01:23:20.394 --> 01:23:21.628
Okay.

01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:29.404
I was thinking that maybe
we could go grab dinner.

01:23:29.436 --> 01:23:31.805
There is a cool speakeasy
that just opened on Lincoln.

01:23:31.838 --> 01:23:34.042
Uh...

01:23:38.578 --> 01:23:40.782
Annika, just so we're clear,

01:23:40.814 --> 01:23:43.550
I appreciate the apology,

01:23:43.583 --> 01:23:46.121
but this is the end for us.

01:24:02.435 --> 01:24:03.771
Hunter...

01:24:07.807 --> 01:24:09.711
Don't leave me.

01:24:12.279 --> 01:24:14.215
Please?

01:24:24.792 --> 01:24:27.062
I gotta go back to work.

01:25:27.253 --> 01:25:29.289
What's happening, Annika?

01:25:32.926 --> 01:25:34.362
Uh...

01:25:37.564 --> 01:25:40.167
I don't know.

01:25:40.201 --> 01:25:43.538
Okay, if you did know,
what would the answer be?

01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:51.311
Maybe it's my drive to succeed

01:25:51.345 --> 01:25:53.414
or to impress.

01:25:56.649 --> 01:26:00.754
I've made all the sacrifices,

01:26:00.787 --> 01:26:05.492
I have done everything,
and it's just not happening.

01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:08.930
Okay, I hear what you're saying.

01:26:08.962 --> 01:26:11.666
So what I'd like you to do
is come sit over here.

01:26:18.238 --> 01:26:19.573
There you go.

01:26:19.606 --> 01:26:24.278
Okay, so let's begin by

01:26:24.310 --> 01:26:26.913
there is an aspect of you,
Annika,

01:26:26.947 --> 01:26:28.716
that is sitting
right in front of you,

01:26:28.748 --> 01:26:33.487
and this aspect
really needs to die.

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:34.889
It's just a part,

01:26:34.921 --> 01:26:36.556
but it's a part
that needs to die

01:26:36.590 --> 01:26:39.560
in order for you to move in
to the fullness of your life,

01:26:39.592 --> 01:26:43.230
the vivacity of your life.

01:26:43.264 --> 01:26:45.233
Tell it to die.

01:26:45.265 --> 01:26:48.001
- Die.
- More, come on.

01:26:48.034 --> 01:26:49.403
- Die!
- Come on,

01:26:49.435 --> 01:26:51.238
I wanna see you mean it.

01:26:52.506 --> 01:26:53.908
- Die!
- Good!

01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:55.443
- Die!
- Good, more!

01:26:55.475 --> 01:26:57.478
- Die!
- Yes!

01:26:57.511 --> 01:27:00.881
Die! Die!

01:27:00.913 --> 01:27:03.251
Die.

01:27:10.024 --> 01:27:14.295
So good, so good, so good.

01:27:14.328 --> 01:27:16.631
So good.

01:27:16.663 --> 01:27:20.300
So good, so good.

01:29:04.037 --> 01:29:07.141
Personally, I think flowers
are overrated.

01:29:08.908 --> 01:29:11.045
I don't know.

01:29:11.078 --> 01:29:13.080
I just think they're overrated.
