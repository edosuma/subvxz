00:01.401 --> 00:02.768
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Okay, let's do this.</i>

00:02.770 --> 00:07.206
<i>Oh, and the doctor,</i>
<i>that happened to be</i>

00:07.208 --> 00:09.341
<i>Rafael's sister luisa,</i>
<i>and luisa also happened to be</i>

00:09.343 --> 00:13.379
<i>Embroiled in an affair</i>
<i>with rose, her stepmother.</i>

00:13.381 --> 00:15.647
<i>But rose turned out to be</i>
<i>crime lord sin rostro,</i>

00:15.649 --> 00:17.149
<i>And luisa disappeared,</i>
<i>perhaps with her.</i>

00:17.151 --> 00:19.051
<i>And you know who was</i>
<i>on the case?</i>

00:19.053 --> 00:21.320
<i>Jane's ex-fiancÃ©,</i>
<i>detective michael cordero.</i>

00:21.322 --> 00:24.723
Meanwhile, jane and rafael fell
<i>in love, but unfortunately,</i>

00:24.725 --> 00:26.258
<i>Rafael's life</i>
<i>was falling apart,</i>

00:26.260 --> 00:28.127
<i>So he spiraled</i>
<i>and broke up with jane.</i>

00:28.129 --> 00:29.795
<i>Not good.</i>
<i>And speaking of breakups,</i>

00:29.797 --> 00:32.564
<i>Jane's mom</i>
<i>was dating jane's dad,</i>

00:32.566 --> 00:35.300
<i>Telenovela star</i>
<i>rogelio de la vega--</i>

00:35.302 --> 00:36.602
<i>Till this happened.</i>

00:36.604 --> 00:38.570
I... Kissed marco.

00:38.572 --> 00:41.473
<i>Oh, and we can't forget</i>
<i>raf's ex-wife petra.</i>

00:41.475 --> 00:43.742
<i>She's had some ups...</i>
<i>I'm assigning my shares</i>
<i>to petra.</i>

00:43.744 --> 00:45.744
<i>...And some downs. See?</i>

00:45.746 --> 00:47.679
<i>She briefly had</i>
<i>a hostage in her room.</i>

00:47.681 --> 00:49.748
<i>Oh, and then she realized</i>
<i>her mother could walk,</i>

00:49.750 --> 00:51.550
<i>Which made it easier</i>
<i>for magda to push</i>

00:51.552 --> 00:52.551
<i>Jane's grandmother</i>
<i>down the stairs.</i>

00:52.553 --> 00:53.619
<i>But alba couldn't remember</i>

00:53.621 --> 00:55.287
What had happened... Until now.

00:58.758 --> 01:00.659
<i>So let's see what happens,</i>
<i>shall we?</i>

01:00.661 --> 01:02.494
<i>In October of 2000,</i>

01:02.496 --> 01:05.297
<i>The most amazing thing</i>
<i>happened...</i>

01:05.299 --> 01:07.833
<i>To young</i>
<i>jane gloriana villanueva.</i>

01:07.835 --> 01:10.069
<i>She watched</i>
<i>her very first telenovela</i>

01:10.071 --> 01:11.703
<i>With her mother</i>
<i>and grandmother.</i>

01:11.705 --> 01:13.839
<i>And from that</i>
<i>very first moment,</i>

01:13.841 --> 01:15.707
<i>She was hooked.</i>

01:15.709 --> 01:18.477
<i>So by the time</i>
<i>she was a young woman,</i>

01:18.479 --> 01:21.380
<i>She was well versed</i>
<i>in the language of amnesia.</i>

01:21.382 --> 01:23.148
<i>And, of course,</i>

01:23.150 --> 01:26.218
<i>The concept of...</i>
<i>Recovered memory.</i>

01:26.220 --> 01:29.154
<i>But that didn't make it</i>
<i>any less incredible...</i>

01:29.156 --> 01:31.290
<i>When it happened</i>
<i>to her grandmother.</i>

01:31.292 --> 01:34.226
You... Remember
the accident?

01:39.099 --> 01:41.533
Abuela, you have
to tell me everything.

01:48.541 --> 01:50.809
Yeah, I remember.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.651
Get out!

02:00.653 --> 02:02.354
Ivan:
Help! Please help!

02:10.830 --> 02:12.397
And you saw petra's mother?

02:22.208 --> 02:24.810
Then we have to go
to the police.

02:31.584 --> 02:33.318
I know you're scared
about your immigration status,

02:33.320 --> 02:35.621
But this is different--
this is a crime!

02:40.727 --> 02:43.162
(vehicle approaches)

02:43.164 --> 02:44.263
Abuela...

02:47.333 --> 02:49.168
Come on, give her some credit.

02:49.170 --> 02:50.235
(door bangs)

02:51.604 --> 02:53.372
Mom?
(sighs)

02:53.374 --> 02:55.474
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

02:55.476 --> 02:58.744
If he wants to be a big baby,
well, two can play at that game.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.212
What are you

03:00.214 --> 03:01.547
Talking about?

03:01.549 --> 03:04.183
Rogelio broke up with me.

03:04.185 --> 03:05.284
What?

03:05.286 --> 03:06.385
I told him that

03:06.387 --> 03:08.387
I kissed marco, and...
(alba groans)

03:08.389 --> 03:10.656
Ma, don't say anything.

03:10.658 --> 03:12.291
I know.

03:13.259 --> 03:15.928
Anyway... He dumped me.

03:15.930 --> 03:18.497
Oh, mom, I'm so sorry.

03:19.933 --> 03:22.935
If it makes you feel any better,
rafael dumped me, too.

03:22.937 --> 03:24.603
Oh, my baby.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.805
(sniffles)

03:34.948 --> 03:36.315
Mmm...
Mmm...

03:36.317 --> 03:38.217
Magda:
<i>A little comfort food.</i>

03:38.219 --> 03:40.485
â™ª

03:40.487 --> 03:43.322
<i>KvasenÃ© uhorky.</i>

03:44.891 --> 03:46.892
Thank you.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.560
Of course.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.495
I was so glad
when you called.

03:50.497 --> 03:52.297
I knew you'd come back to me.

03:52.299 --> 03:55.267
A girl needs her <i>matka.</i>

03:55.269 --> 03:57.236
Mother, I just
didn't want

03:57.238 --> 03:59.538
To be alone
after the whole ordeal...

03:59.540 --> 04:02.341
With roman, but I...
Haven't forgiven you.

04:02.343 --> 04:04.276
All those years
of you pretending

04:04.278 --> 04:06.345
You couldn't walk
just to manipulate me?

04:06.347 --> 04:08.547
It was to protect you.
I was afraid you

04:08.549 --> 04:09.815
Would go back to milos.

04:09.817 --> 04:12.417
And that man, he is a monster!

04:12.419 --> 04:13.819
Petra...

04:14.954 --> 04:17.422
...Please?

04:19.559 --> 04:21.927
Let me prove myself to you.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.528
Rogelio:
<i>How?</i>

04:23.530 --> 04:24.896
How can I forgive you, xiomara?

04:24.898 --> 04:26.431
I stayed in miami for you.

04:26.433 --> 04:27.833
In this ridiculous job!

04:27.835 --> 04:29.501
â™ª

04:38.444 --> 04:39.911
(popping)

04:44.951 --> 04:46.718
Rogelio:
<i>And what do you do?</i>

04:46.720 --> 04:48.520
You betray me, xiomara.

04:48.522 --> 04:49.721
(knocking)

04:49.723 --> 04:50.989
I must go.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.858
I am being summoned to set...

04:52.860 --> 04:55.627
To play a head!

04:57.397 --> 05:00.332
(romantic guitar music plays)

05:00.933 --> 05:03.435
Can I come in?

05:04.737 --> 05:07.339
(music distorts, winds down)

05:07.341 --> 05:08.607
I'm afraid you cannot.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.475
I'll get to it, then.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.911
Since you've left,
our ratings have plummeted.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.346
Have they?

05:14.348 --> 05:16.682
Rogelio,
you've tweeted about it.

05:16.684 --> 05:18.517
Extensively.

05:18.519 --> 05:19.618
What is your point?

05:19.620 --> 05:20.952
We want you back.

05:20.954 --> 05:24.389
I happen to be very happy
here at <i>galactica.</i>

05:24.391 --> 05:27.025
It's quite a challenge
to act only with your face...

05:27.027 --> 05:29.494
And hair.
Just consider it?

05:29.496 --> 05:30.962
How would you
even bring me back?

05:30.964 --> 05:32.764
According to buzzfeed,
el presidente's stabbing

05:32.766 --> 05:34.833
Was one of the 17
most unforgettable death scenes

05:34.835 --> 05:36.101
Of the past five years.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.569
We have a pitch.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.671
Not that old "evil twin" clichÃ©.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.773
Dina:
<i>No.</i>

05:41.775 --> 05:44.843
It involves a kevlar vest,
a burial at sea, amnesia

05:44.845 --> 05:47.846
And a super sexy scene
where el presidente emerges

05:47.848 --> 05:49.548
From the water
in a soaking-wet shirt.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.550
Button-down or pullover?
Button-down.

05:51.552 --> 05:52.851
Mm.
We'd also
offer you

05:52.853 --> 05:55.053
An executive producer credit,
of course.

05:55.055 --> 05:56.922
I will think about it.

05:56.924 --> 06:00.625
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to get ready for work.

06:04.130 --> 06:07.032
Santos is back,

06:07.034 --> 06:10.369
Baby...!

06:10.371 --> 06:12.604
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And speaking of babies...</i>

06:12.606 --> 06:13.939
(rhythmic whooshing)

06:13.941 --> 06:16.441
Woman:
All righty, that's it.

06:16.443 --> 06:17.843
The doctor will
be right in.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.945
Thank you.
Thank you.

06:25.551 --> 06:27.018
(sighs)

06:27.020 --> 06:29.688
I am so sorry, jane.

06:30.923 --> 06:33.125
That you don't love me?

06:33.127 --> 06:35.560
<i>Oh, but he did...</i>

06:35.562 --> 06:37.729
<i>Despite what he told her.</i>

06:37.731 --> 06:39.698
That I hurt you.

06:41.167 --> 06:43.402
<i>Rafael knew things</i>
<i>between them would settle,</i>

06:43.404 --> 06:44.803
<i>Get better with time.</i>

06:44.805 --> 06:47.105
Look, I just want what's
best for our baby.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.741
I'm sorry, can you
just stop talking?

06:51.911 --> 06:53.612
You just broke up
with me yesterday.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.680
It's kind of hard...
I under... I get it.

06:55.682 --> 06:56.948
I just need some time.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.683
All right.
(clears throat)

06:58.685 --> 07:00.919
Everything's
looking good.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.588
Baby's weight: 62nd percentile.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.757
Baby's height: 78th percentile.

07:05.759 --> 07:06.825
Mm.
But currently,

07:06.827 --> 07:08.093
The baby is breech.

07:09.729 --> 07:11.963
Uh, breech?

07:11.965 --> 07:13.832
What is that again?
He didn't read the book.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.000
I mean, in his defense,

07:15.002 --> 07:18.437
I only asked him
to do it three times.

07:19.872 --> 07:21.473
Head is
up here,

07:21.475 --> 07:22.707
Tush is down here,

07:22.709 --> 07:24.443
And the baby needs
to be head-down

07:24.445 --> 07:25.744
For a natural delivery.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.712
Let's get you measured.
So...

07:27.714 --> 07:29.881
Should I be concerned?

07:29.883 --> 07:32.517
Oh, no. Not yet.
Breech babies

07:32.519 --> 07:34.152
Often turn themselves.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.655
Let's check again
in two weeks.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.223
(squeaking)

07:47.166 --> 07:49.167
All right,
so the bigger

07:49.169 --> 07:52.637
The baby gets,
the less space it has to flip.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.639
What can I do?
I'd definitely like

07:54.641 --> 07:56.641
To avoid a c-section,
if possible.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.176
And I'd like to avoid
a version.

07:58.178 --> 07:59.478
That's a med...

07:59.480 --> 08:01.880
A medical procedure
to turn the baby.

08:01.882 --> 08:05.050
I read up when she
said it was breech.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.985
Okay. Cool.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.187
These are a bunch of at-home
techniques you can try.

08:09.189 --> 08:11.523
I can't promise they'll work,
but give them a shot.

08:11.525 --> 08:13.225
And I'll see you
in two weeks.

08:13.227 --> 08:14.860
Thank you.
Thank you, doctor.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.764
So, is there anything

08:19.766 --> 08:22.767
That I can... Help with?

08:22.769 --> 08:25.670
Oh, no. Looks like I have
to do this stuff myself.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.138
Don't worry,

08:27.140 --> 08:30.976
When the baby comes, there
will be plenty for you to do.

08:32.979 --> 08:34.913
But for now, well...

08:34.915 --> 08:38.183
You can't exactly help me
with... Elephant walk.

08:38.185 --> 08:40.986
What are
you doing?
To help turn the baby.

08:40.988 --> 08:44.155
Using gravity, right?
You pull her down...

08:44.157 --> 08:47.526
And then around, and then down.

08:47.528 --> 08:50.195
Well, I can't have a serious
conversation with you like this.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.296
Fine.

08:51.298 --> 08:53.265
I needed a break, anyway.

08:53.267 --> 08:55.901
Your father
won't answer my calls.

08:58.304 --> 09:01.072
He had his assistant move
my stuff from our...

09:01.074 --> 09:02.707
His house.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.709
He even blocked me on twitter.

09:04.711 --> 09:05.977
I don't know
what to do.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.712
Mom, he's angry.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.714
But it was one mistake.

09:09.716 --> 09:12.083
One... Stupid,
meant-nothing mistake

09:12.085 --> 09:15.053
That I wish I could take back.

09:16.822 --> 09:18.056
I know, mom.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.925
So can you tell him that?

09:19.927 --> 09:22.193
What?
Maybe if he
hears it

09:22.195 --> 09:24.596
From you, you know?
How sorry I am.

09:24.598 --> 09:25.964
I wouldn't ask,

09:25.966 --> 09:29.234
But... I'm out of options.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.336
Petra:
<i>It's a good option.</i>

09:31.338 --> 09:33.872
Okay, look, time-shares would
mean a cash influx now,

09:33.874 --> 09:36.608
Which is what we need.
No, what we need
is time.

09:36.610 --> 09:38.810
We'll take out another loan
to cover the balloon payment

09:38.812 --> 09:41.746
Until we ride this out.
Another risky move
is not the answer.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.248
Neither is rebranding
the hotel.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.816
Luisa:
Hey there.

09:45.751 --> 09:47.586
Maybe I can help.

09:47.588 --> 09:49.154
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ah, yes, you remember</i>

09:49.156 --> 09:50.822
<i>Rafael's sister luisa, right?</i>

09:50.824 --> 09:52.223
Luisa.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.733
Where have you been? The police
have been looking for you.

10:01.735 --> 10:05.837
I know. I left them a voice mail
the second I got back stateside.

10:06.973 --> 10:08.840
Uh, were you...
Were you with rose?

10:08.842 --> 10:10.308
Of course not.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.611
She's a murderer
that killed her father.

10:12.613 --> 10:13.778
I went back

10:13.780 --> 10:16.314
To my ashram in peru
to get over her,

10:16.316 --> 10:18.316
And I did.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.385
As a matter of fact...

10:20.387 --> 10:22.053
Hey, juice!

10:22.055 --> 10:23.321
Don't be shy.

10:23.323 --> 10:26.324
This... Is my
new girlfriend,

10:26.326 --> 10:27.926
The one and only...

10:27.928 --> 10:29.794
Juicy jordan.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.329
Nice to meet you.

10:32.398 --> 10:33.798
Oh, you probably just don't

10:33.800 --> 10:35.000
Recognize her
outside of the ring.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.034
Out of the ring?

10:36.036 --> 10:37.135
I'm a pro wrestler.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.403
Yeah, you are.

10:41.941 --> 10:43.942
Wow, that's
terrific.

10:43.944 --> 10:46.778
And, um... How did
you two meet?

10:46.780 --> 10:48.747
Oh, our first day
in the sweat lodge,

10:48.749 --> 10:50.915
Juicy just... She
just got way too hot.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.218
And I mean that in
the medical sense.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.286
Although... (scoffs)
look at her.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.921
Look at <i>you.</i>
<i>I can't.</i>

10:56.923 --> 10:58.289
I'm too busy looking at you.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.892
(both growling)

11:00.894 --> 11:02.360
(clears throat)

11:02.362 --> 11:05.830
So... What brought you back?

11:05.832 --> 11:07.766
Well, the hotel is in trouble,

11:07.768 --> 11:10.902
So juicy encouraged me to
reach out to our accountant,

11:10.904 --> 11:12.037
And he told me
that our profits

11:12.039 --> 11:14.839
Are down and we lost
our liquor license.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.708
So we discussed it

11:16.710 --> 11:18.009
And decided that
it's about time

11:18.011 --> 11:19.844
That I help
right this ship.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.880
Right it?
How, exactly?
I don't know yet.

11:21.882 --> 11:24.382
But I have an iq of
152, and I basically

11:24.384 --> 11:27.385
Got through med school drunk,
so I'll figure it out.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.854
Oh, and...
Obviously, I'm gonna

11:29.856 --> 11:31.289
Take back control
of my shares.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.424
What, now?
Definitely.

11:32.426 --> 11:34.392
I mean, from what I heard,

11:34.394 --> 11:36.027
It looks like I'm
the tiebreaking vote

11:36.029 --> 11:38.263
In this time-share
versus new loan decision.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.999
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Huh. That's a surprise.</i>

11:41.001 --> 11:44.269
<i>Also in for a surprise--</i>
<i>our jane.</i>

11:47.139 --> 11:48.406
What are you doing here?

11:48.408 --> 11:50.775
I work in the kitchen.

11:50.777 --> 11:51.776
Here.

11:51.778 --> 11:53.378
Clean glasses for the bar.

11:54.914 --> 11:56.281
I know what you did.

11:56.283 --> 11:58.316
Excuse me?
You pushed
my grandmother

11:58.318 --> 11:59.751
Down the stairs.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.921
Well, if that were true,

12:02.923 --> 12:05.023
I would be in jail, no?

12:05.025 --> 12:06.791
And I am not.

12:08.127 --> 12:10.962
Take the glasses to the bar.

12:22.942 --> 12:24.409
Petra.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.177
I want your mother
out of this hotel.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.079
Excuse me?
She pushed

12:28.081 --> 12:30.081
My grandmother down the
stairs and almost killed her.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.517
What are you talking about?
Attempted murder.

12:32.519 --> 12:35.153
And I'm going to make sure
that she pays for it.

12:45.164 --> 12:46.431
Abuela.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.399
I saw magda today.

12:49.535 --> 12:51.035
She's working at the marbella.

12:54.240 --> 12:55.273
Xiomara:
Hey, guys.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.809
Oh, hey, ma. Hi.

12:57.811 --> 13:00.044
What's going on?

13:00.046 --> 13:02.447
Nothing, just,
like, a rafael thing.

13:09.388 --> 13:12.123
Okay, you're scaring me--
what happened?

13:13.993 --> 13:15.927
Petra's mom
pushed her down the stairs.

13:15.929 --> 13:16.995
What?
Yeah, and now abuela

13:16.997 --> 13:18.062
Doesn't want to go
to the police

13:18.064 --> 13:19.097
Because she's
undocumented.

13:19.099 --> 13:22.000
That bitch needs to go to jail!
See?

13:23.102 --> 13:24.502
I am calm!
She's calm.

13:24.504 --> 13:25.937
Come on, there's
got to be something

13:25.939 --> 13:27.338
We can do.
There is.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.440
Michael can help us.

13:30.342 --> 13:31.810
He's done it before.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.244
What?
Mom, when you were

13:33.246 --> 13:34.512
In the hospital,
some immigration

13:34.514 --> 13:36.147
Stuff came up, and...

13:36.149 --> 13:38.516
Michael made it go away.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.852
What?

13:40.854 --> 13:42.253
Why didn't you tell me?

13:42.255 --> 13:43.521
He asked me not to.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.990
He didn't want you
to think that he did it

13:45.992 --> 13:47.592
To get you back
or anything.

13:51.864 --> 13:54.299
(knocking)

13:54.301 --> 13:57.101
Jane. What are
you doing here?

13:57.103 --> 13:59.971
Latin lover narrator: <i>Sometimes</i>
<i>there just aren't words</i>

13:59.973 --> 14:03.508
<i>To express the kind</i>
<i>of gratitude one is feeling.</i>

14:03.510 --> 14:05.577
Okay.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.381
You saved my grandmother.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.016
Thank you,
thank you, thank you

14:12.018 --> 14:14.586
So, so much.
Your mother

14:14.588 --> 14:16.087
Wasn't supposed
to tell you that.

14:16.089 --> 14:18.623
I know.

14:18.625 --> 14:21.259
But she did because...

14:21.261 --> 14:23.027
We need your help again.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.996
I just got off the phone
with the police.

14:24.998 --> 14:27.031
They want to bring us
both in for questioning

14:27.033 --> 14:29.367
In relation to an
attempted homicide.

14:29.369 --> 14:32.270
Uh, mother? Mother.

14:38.544 --> 14:42.280
Did you have anything
to do with this...

14:42.282 --> 14:44.883
Stair incident?

14:44.885 --> 14:46.417
Mother, did you push her?

14:46.419 --> 14:47.986
I would never do that.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.888
Okay.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.923
Unless, for example,

14:51.925 --> 14:53.558
That woman found out that

14:53.560 --> 14:56.127
There was a hostage
in your room.

14:56.129 --> 14:57.595
Then I would
have to

14:57.597 --> 14:59.631
Try to keep her quiet
to keep you

14:59.633 --> 15:01.532
Out of prison, no?

15:01.534 --> 15:03.601
To protect you.

15:03.603 --> 15:06.638
Man:
Tell me your sins, my daughter.

15:28.093 --> 15:30.161
Is your back feeling any better?

15:34.600 --> 15:36.968
I'm sure this priest, uh,

15:36.970 --> 15:40.305
Understood your invitation
as a form of friendship.

15:40.307 --> 15:44.208
A friendship he would
very much like.

15:44.210 --> 15:47.712
So go in peace and
serve the lord our god.

15:47.714 --> 15:52.016
And would you like to have lunch
after physical therapy?

15:54.053 --> 15:55.586
<i>Spirituality & colonics.</i>

15:55.588 --> 15:58.456
Trying to bribe my sister
into voting your way?

15:58.458 --> 16:00.158
Seriously?

16:04.330 --> 16:06.397
Sloopy sweets!

16:06.399 --> 16:09.600
My favorite.
Oh, my god, juicy, we used to

16:09.602 --> 16:12.537
Eat these
as kids.

16:12.539 --> 16:15.006
I've finished reading
your proposals,

16:15.008 --> 16:17.408
And...

16:17.410 --> 16:20.178
I still need more time
weighing out the pros

16:20.180 --> 16:22.413
And the cons.
But in the meantime,

16:22.415 --> 16:26.017
We have an idea for
a short-term cash windfall.

16:26.019 --> 16:28.419
Well, actually, it
was juicy's idea.

16:28.421 --> 16:31.022
She has this incredible
brain for business.

16:31.024 --> 16:35.293
Did you know she has her own
line of velour sweatpants?

16:35.295 --> 16:36.728
Oh, okay. Well, they're
not aren't actually hers,

16:36.730 --> 16:38.296
But still-- she looks
amazing in them.

16:38.298 --> 16:39.697
So, luisa,

16:39.699 --> 16:42.633
Tell us about your idea.

16:44.470 --> 16:46.537
Melee at the marbella.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.375
Professional wrestling
match.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.343
Here?
Right in the lounge.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.578
I'll face off in the ring

16:53.580 --> 16:56.114
Against my nemesis,
candy crunch.

17:00.052 --> 17:02.186
People go nuts for a juicy
versus candy matchup.

17:02.188 --> 17:04.188
And we can attract a whole
new crowd, definitely

17:04.190 --> 17:06.257
Make some extra cash--
what do you think?

17:09.094 --> 17:10.094
I love the idea.

17:10.096 --> 17:11.329
Aah!

17:11.331 --> 17:13.331
So much fun.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.400
Petra:
<i>Tell her this can't happen.</i>

17:15.402 --> 17:16.601
No, you tell her.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.102
Oh, no, I'm not
telling her anything.

17:18.104 --> 17:19.771
Well, neither am I.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.176
Looks like we'll be having
a wrestling match

17:25.178 --> 17:26.210
At the marbella, then.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.212
Perfect. Can't wait.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.781
(short laugh)

17:41.827 --> 17:44.529
Director:
Action.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.486
Cut!

18:08.488 --> 18:10.154
Jane.

18:10.156 --> 18:12.824
What a wonderful surprise.

18:12.826 --> 18:14.659
Wow, that was
quite the entrance.

18:14.661 --> 18:16.127
Isn't it?
Yeah.

18:16.129 --> 18:18.129
Would you like to go
to my remodeled

18:18.131 --> 18:19.530
Actor's dressing room

18:19.532 --> 18:22.533
Or my new producer's
corner office

18:22.535 --> 18:25.103
With a fantastic ocean view?

18:25.105 --> 18:27.105
Um, oh, you know,
the quiet little corner

18:27.107 --> 18:28.439
Right there
by the dungeon's fine.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.374
Dungeon's fine.
Okay.

18:30.376 --> 18:32.443
So...

18:32.445 --> 18:34.445
It's about mom.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.314
What?
I've never seen
her like this.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.683
And I know she
messed up, got...

18:38.685 --> 18:41.519
S-stop, jane, please.
I thought you came here

18:41.521 --> 18:44.155
To support my triumphant
return as santos.

18:44.157 --> 18:47.692
Not to support your cheating
mother's agenda to get me back.

18:47.694 --> 18:51.596
I'm sorry. She's
just so upset.

18:51.598 --> 18:54.198
As am I.
Dad.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.167
It was just a kiss.
Just a kiss?

18:56.169 --> 18:58.336
It starts with just a kiss.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.872
And it ends
with a tabloid photo

19:00.874 --> 19:04.575
Of her sneaking out of a rap
superstar's hotel room.

19:04.577 --> 19:07.378
Is that some
kind of metaphor?

19:07.380 --> 19:08.779
No, it's not.

19:08.781 --> 19:11.149
My first wife did just that.

19:11.151 --> 19:15.686
So this is the baggage
you're dealing with.

19:15.688 --> 19:18.289
Okay, well, this was a
very different situation.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.725
He was humiliated.
You obviously touched a nerve.

19:20.727 --> 19:22.894
But don't you think
he should at least talk to me?

19:22.896 --> 19:25.897
Yes, but I also think you
shouldn't have kissed marco.

19:25.899 --> 19:27.598
(phone vibrates)

19:28.567 --> 19:30.434
Hang on. It's rafael.

19:38.744 --> 19:40.411
How did you do it?

19:40.413 --> 19:41.879
What?

19:41.881 --> 19:44.482
Move on from rafael.
Because I can't with rogelio.

19:47.252 --> 19:50.555
I mean, once he told me he
didn't love me, I had no choice.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.890
The problem is,
is you did not get closure.

19:52.892 --> 19:55.860
Exactly. Okay...

19:55.862 --> 19:58.262
Where is that music
coming from?

19:58.264 --> 20:00.598
Oh, that's my pants.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.467
It's supposed to encourage
the baby to turn

20:03.469 --> 20:05.469
Towards the music.

20:06.939 --> 20:09.640
I just can't
be in the middle, okay?

20:09.642 --> 20:12.210
Carrying messages
between you and dad. I...
I know.

20:12.212 --> 20:14.445
I just need to get
in the same room with him

20:14.447 --> 20:16.914
So we can talk,
face to face.

20:21.853 --> 20:23.454
Let's start with
an easy question.

20:23.456 --> 20:25.223
Where were you
after the palomas?

20:25.225 --> 20:27.225
In my room.
Were you alone?

20:27.227 --> 20:28.859
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Just her and her hostage.</i>

20:28.861 --> 20:31.963
No. I was with my daughter.

20:31.965 --> 20:33.664
I was resting with my mother.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.466
And then
that woman, alba,

20:35.468 --> 20:37.501
Banged on the door.

20:37.503 --> 20:38.836
What'd she want?

20:38.838 --> 20:40.471
She was obviously
quite drunk.

20:40.473 --> 20:42.340
Very drunk.

20:42.342 --> 20:43.741
My mother told her
to go away.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.343
And that was that.

20:45.345 --> 20:46.544
Care to explain the man's voice

20:46.546 --> 20:48.613
Crying out for help
in your room?

20:48.615 --> 20:50.781
Must have been the tv.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.483
Petra:
<i>We were watching a telenovela.</i>

20:52.485 --> 20:54.018
They can get
very dramatic.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.620
Jane:
<i>They lied.</i>

20:55.622 --> 20:57.388
They both lied, michael.

20:57.390 --> 20:58.756
I know.
Now we got them

20:58.758 --> 21:00.891
On record telling their version,

21:00.893 --> 21:02.560
So we just prove it's not true.

21:02.562 --> 21:04.762
Okay. How do we do that?

21:04.764 --> 21:06.564
Oh, I see you.

21:06.566 --> 21:09.367
We either prove petra
wasn't actually in the room,

21:09.369 --> 21:13.437
Or we find the guy abuela heard.
I'll get room service records,

21:13.439 --> 21:16.307
Key card records...
What?

21:16.309 --> 21:20.311
Uh, is there a...
Wrestling match going on?

21:20.313 --> 21:22.713
I have no idea why
that's happening.

21:22.715 --> 21:26.851
Rafael and I aren't exactly
on chatty terms these days.

21:26.853 --> 21:29.053
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry to hear that.

21:29.055 --> 21:31.055
Are you?

21:31.057 --> 21:33.391
Yes. 'cause he's the father
of your child,

21:33.393 --> 21:35.459
And I'd imagine
that'd be hard for you.

21:35.461 --> 21:39.463
Go to your shift. I'll let
you know if I hear anything.

21:39.465 --> 21:42.400
Oh, if you see magda, walk away.

21:42.402 --> 21:44.869
Okay. I'll see you later.
Thank you.

21:51.743 --> 21:55.813
(bell dinging)

21:59.885 --> 22:03.421
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And speaking of</i>
<i>mortal enemies...</i>

22:03.423 --> 22:05.790
<i>Walk away, jane.</i>
<i>Just walk away.</i>

22:05.792 --> 22:08.893
I talked to your policeman
friend yesterday.

22:08.895 --> 22:13.364
I'm so sorry that your
grandmother got so confused.

22:13.366 --> 22:15.666
She was not confused.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.501
We both know what you did.

22:17.503 --> 22:19.537
And we're gonna prove it
and put you in jail.

22:19.539 --> 22:23.441
I looked your grandmother up
on the internet. No sign of her.

22:23.443 --> 22:26.444
That and the fact that she
really does not speak english,

22:26.446 --> 22:29.447
It just got me thinking.

22:29.449 --> 22:32.717
Is your grandmother
here legally?

22:34.820 --> 22:37.121
See, I don't mind
either way.

22:37.123 --> 22:39.657
But those immigration
authorities sure do.

22:39.659 --> 22:42.660
So both of you should maybe...

22:42.662 --> 22:45.930
Back off.

22:53.071 --> 22:54.739
Ladies and gentlemen,

22:54.741 --> 22:57.475
Welcome to the melee
at the marbella!

22:57.477 --> 22:59.810
(cheering)

22:59.812 --> 23:01.545
Please welcome
our first fighter,

23:01.547 --> 23:03.581
Coming down from the aisle
to my right,

23:03.583 --> 23:05.583
The pride of pensacola,

23:05.585 --> 23:08.686
Please welcome candy crunch!

23:08.688 --> 23:12.456
(hip-hop music playing)

23:14.025 --> 23:17.595
And in the opposite corner,
everyone's favorite diva,

23:17.597 --> 23:21.532
Hailing from the heavenly hamlet
of santa rosa, california,

23:21.534 --> 23:23.734
The one, the only

23:23.736 --> 23:26.737
Juicy jordan!

23:26.739 --> 23:29.473
(hip-hop music playing)

23:37.849 --> 23:39.617
Jane. Hi.

23:39.619 --> 23:41.652
I need your help.
Of course. Anything.

23:41.654 --> 23:42.820
It's about my grandmother.

23:42.822 --> 23:44.155
(bell dings)

23:44.157 --> 23:47.725
(cheering)

23:47.727 --> 23:49.827
Remember the accident?

23:49.829 --> 23:52.163
Well, she didn't fall down
the stairs-- she was pushed.

23:52.165 --> 23:53.898
Wait, what?

23:53.900 --> 23:55.132
By petra's mother.

23:55.134 --> 23:56.767
Magda?
Yes.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.169
And now she's working
at the hotel,

23:58.171 --> 23:59.670
And she's making threats.
Petra: Right.

23:59.672 --> 24:01.672
I heard about your
little altercation.

24:01.674 --> 24:04.041
Your mother is threatening
to get my grandmother deported.

24:04.043 --> 24:06.477
Your grandmother is trying
to have my mother imprisoned.

24:06.479 --> 24:08.179
Because your mother belongs
in prison!

24:08.181 --> 24:09.613
My mother had nothing to do with

24:09.615 --> 24:10.614
What happened
to your grandmother.

24:10.616 --> 24:11.715
You're a liar!

24:11.717 --> 24:12.817
No, I'm not!

24:13.752 --> 24:17.888
(bell dinging)

24:17.890 --> 24:20.658
It's the smackdown we've all
been waiting for, as these two

24:20.660 --> 24:23.127
Have had it out
for one another all year.

24:23.129 --> 24:25.663
Oh, and the pregnant punisher
comes out swinging!

24:25.665 --> 24:28.866
But the cold warrior denies her
with the classic eastern block!

24:28.868 --> 24:31.602
She follows it up
with the brainwasher!

24:31.604 --> 24:33.504
Ooh, that one hurt.

24:33.506 --> 24:35.906
But the cold warrior's not
giving her a maternity leave.

24:35.908 --> 24:37.775
She's looking
to deliver this match

24:37.777 --> 24:39.510
Right here, right now!

24:39.512 --> 24:41.545
â™ª

24:48.487 --> 24:51.922
Ladies and gentlemen,
she pulls out the belly bump!

24:51.924 --> 24:55.960
The punisher has just turned
this cold war hot!

24:55.962 --> 24:59.964
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Crowd:
Jane! Jane! Jane! Jane! Jane!

24:59.966 --> 25:02.733
I want your mother out
of this hotel!

25:02.735 --> 25:04.201
Okay, okay. Hey, hey, hey.

25:04.203 --> 25:08.072
Hey, jane.
Hey, I'll handle this, okay?

25:11.176 --> 25:13.544
What the hell
is going on?

25:13.546 --> 25:15.946
I have no idea. Those
two suddenly started

25:15.948 --> 25:17.815
With these
wild accusations.

25:17.817 --> 25:20.684
Her grandmother
wouldn't make that up.
No, of course not.

25:20.686 --> 25:23.621
But she's elderly.
And she was drunk.

25:23.623 --> 25:25.823
And she sustained
a head injury.

25:25.825 --> 25:28.158
(cheering)

25:28.160 --> 25:30.694
Whatever it is,
jane can't work here with her.

25:30.696 --> 25:32.029
Rafael, I am not

25:32.031 --> 25:35.032
Firing my mother to make
your girlfriend happy.

25:35.034 --> 25:37.067
Latin lover narrator:
<i>The truth was, rafael hadn't</i>

25:37.069 --> 25:38.969
<i>Told people</i>
<i>he and jane had broken up.</i>

25:38.971 --> 25:40.905
She's not my girlfriend anymore.

25:43.575 --> 25:45.175
So you're trying
to get her back?

25:45.177 --> 25:47.745
No. I broke up with her.

25:49.080 --> 25:51.849
But she's still the
mother of my child.

25:51.851 --> 25:53.684
And even if her
grandmother is confused,

25:53.686 --> 25:55.853
Having magda here is
stressing her out,

25:55.855 --> 25:59.223
So please just find her
a job somewhere else.

25:59.225 --> 26:00.791
(crowd cheering)

26:00.793 --> 26:04.995
Jane? Jane?

26:04.997 --> 26:08.232
I assume this parent
trap was your doing.

26:08.234 --> 26:10.901
I love that movie,
but it's not going to work.

26:11.870 --> 26:15.739
(bell dinging)

26:15.741 --> 26:17.141
It's not a trap.

26:17.143 --> 26:19.610
I just want you guys
to talk to each other,

26:19.612 --> 26:22.246
And I want you
to leave me out of it.
Fine.

26:22.248 --> 26:24.248
Talk.

26:24.250 --> 26:27.351
Ma. Now's your chance.

26:29.120 --> 26:32.823
I'm-I'm sorry I kissed marco.

26:32.825 --> 26:34.825
It was stupid and immature,

26:34.827 --> 26:37.695
And-and I've replayed it, like,
a million times in my head,

26:37.697 --> 26:40.164
And I wish...
You have no idea how hard

26:40.166 --> 26:41.932
I wish I could take it back.

26:43.268 --> 26:45.269
Because I love you.

26:45.271 --> 26:47.705
I really do.

26:47.707 --> 26:49.640
So please

26:49.642 --> 26:52.977
Give me another chance.

26:52.979 --> 26:55.045
No.

26:55.047 --> 26:57.247
This is why I didn't
want to see you,

26:57.249 --> 26:59.283
Because I knew
you'd argue with me...

26:59.285 --> 27:00.784
(chuckling)

27:04.055 --> 27:05.322
What was that?

27:05.324 --> 27:06.790
My fans.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.659
I'm constantly
being photographed.

27:08.661 --> 27:10.928
Apparently it's quite a get
for the paparazzi.

27:10.930 --> 27:12.663
Latin lover narrator:
<i>You know that feeling</i>

27:12.665 --> 27:14.732
When a great idea comes to you?

27:14.734 --> 27:16.967
(bell dinging)
<i>okay, that's just</i>
<i>a happy coincidence.</i>

27:16.969 --> 27:18.936
<i>But jane was definitely</i>
<i>having that feeling.</i>

27:18.938 --> 27:20.204
I have to go.

27:20.206 --> 27:22.206
(typing)

27:24.943 --> 27:26.977
<i>I should explain.</i>

27:26.979 --> 27:28.846
<i>See, jane's looking</i>
<i>for a picture</i>

27:28.848 --> 27:30.714
<i>Of petra at the after-party.</i>

27:30.716 --> 27:32.950
If she can prove she was there,

27:32.952 --> 27:34.752
<i>They can catch her in her lie.</i>

27:41.359 --> 27:43.293
<i>I should explain.</i>

27:43.295 --> 27:45.262
<i>Jane could not find a picture</i>
<i>of petra</i>

27:45.264 --> 27:46.997
<i>At the paloma after-party</i>

27:46.999 --> 27:49.133
<i>And prove she wasn't in a room</i>
<i>with magda</i>

27:49.135 --> 27:50.834
<i>When alba was pushed.</i>

27:50.836 --> 27:53.971
<i>But she did find something</i>
<i>even better.</i>

28:03.014 --> 28:05.382
(cheering)

28:16.294 --> 28:18.896
We've got them, michael.

28:25.837 --> 28:27.204
So you're absolutely sure

28:27.206 --> 28:29.473
No one was in the room
with you and your mother

28:29.475 --> 28:30.908
On the night
of the palomas?

28:30.910 --> 28:32.242
Yes, michael, I'm sure, okay?

28:32.244 --> 28:33.844
Look, now, if you'll
excuse me, I...

28:33.846 --> 28:35.145
So who's this?

28:40.051 --> 28:42.152
â™ª

28:46.758 --> 28:50.094
Oh, I...
(chuckles) I forgot.

28:50.096 --> 28:52.896
Latin lover narrator:
<i>About the man you held hostage</i>
<i>for over a month?</i>

28:52.898 --> 28:54.465
I called a plumber that night.
<i>Really?</i>

28:54.467 --> 28:57.401
That's the best you could do?
A plumber?

28:57.403 --> 28:59.403
So he must be an employee
of the hotel,

28:59.405 --> 29:01.238
Which means there's a record.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.741
Uh, no. He's-he's not
an employee, actually.

29:03.743 --> 29:05.909
Rafael and I were
in a bad place at the time,

29:05.911 --> 29:07.311
And he cut off the hotel's
resources to our room,

29:07.313 --> 29:08.312
So I had to call someone else.

29:08.314 --> 29:10.080
Fine.

29:10.082 --> 29:12.349
Can you give me
his contact information?
I must have called

29:12.351 --> 29:14.084
A dozen plumbers that night.
I mean...

29:14.086 --> 29:16.220
I really don't think
I can remember which one.

29:16.222 --> 29:18.088
Try hard.

29:18.090 --> 29:19.289
Look for the work order.

29:19.291 --> 29:21.258
I'll be
looking, too.

29:24.329 --> 29:26.196
30 inches.

29:26.198 --> 29:28.065
So we should definitely
build out here.

29:28.067 --> 29:29.500
Got it. That's
what I thought.

29:32.203 --> 29:33.470
No. He's not coming.

29:33.472 --> 29:34.838
You know--

29:34.840 --> 29:37.374
Things are strained
between mom and him.

29:39.077 --> 29:41.779
I'm sorry, honey.
Jane: It's fine.

29:41.781 --> 29:43.313
I'm sure you guys
will sort things out.

29:43.315 --> 29:44.515
Anyway, let's start.

29:44.517 --> 29:46.316
Okay, we need
socket screws for the feet,

29:46.318 --> 29:48.919
Three-inch head bolt with nut
for the legs.

29:50.088 --> 29:51.388
Okay, we'll
get started

29:51.390 --> 29:52.790
With the leg panels.

29:52.792 --> 29:54.458
(phone vibrating)
(sighs)

29:54.460 --> 29:56.226
Jane (recorded):
<i>You've reached jane.</i>

29:56.228 --> 29:58.061
Leave a message.
(beep)

29:58.063 --> 30:00.931
Hey, jane. It's me. Um...

30:00.933 --> 30:04.234
I'm just calling
'cause I wanted to let you know

30:04.236 --> 30:07.237
That I asked petra
to fire magda.

30:07.239 --> 30:09.973
So I'm doing everything I can.

30:09.975 --> 30:13.210
I just don't want you to worry.
And I...

30:13.212 --> 30:16.980
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And briefly, she thought</i>
<i>he'd say, "I love you."</i>

30:16.982 --> 30:19.416
I'll talk to you later.

30:21.352 --> 30:25.856
<i>But alas, he didn't.</i>

30:25.858 --> 30:28.425
<i>Even though he wanted to.</i>

30:28.427 --> 30:31.395
Luisa:
Oh, rafael! (chuckles)
there you are.

30:31.397 --> 30:34.565
So? It went great, right?

30:34.567 --> 30:37.000
We should make this
a monthly tradition.

30:37.002 --> 30:39.102
What?
Wrestling.

30:39.104 --> 30:41.271
Monthly. Even weekly. I mean,
if we play our cards right,

30:41.273 --> 30:43.407
We could make this miami's
premiere destination

30:43.409 --> 30:45.008
For wrestling...
Stop. Stop it!

30:45.010 --> 30:46.410
We are
not turning

30:46.412 --> 30:49.513
The marbella
into a wrestling destination.

30:49.515 --> 30:52.015
Well, petra thinks
it's a great idea.
That is because

30:52.017 --> 30:53.584
Petra is trying to get you
to vote her way.

30:55.053 --> 30:56.453
We both are.

30:56.455 --> 30:59.022
Finally.

30:59.024 --> 31:01.592
A moment of honesty.

31:01.594 --> 31:04.528
I have an iq of 152, remember?

31:04.530 --> 31:07.631
It's just you two were so
eager to please, I figured

31:07.633 --> 31:09.933
Why not just have some fun
and let...

31:09.935 --> 31:11.435
And let juicy get some press?

31:11.437 --> 31:14.304
Okay. An honest conversation.

31:15.907 --> 31:17.975
Dad and I had a plan
for this hotel.

31:17.977 --> 31:20.510
We were gonna give ian schrager
a run for his money.

31:20.512 --> 31:22.246
What, by floating more loans?

31:22.248 --> 31:24.615
We can ride this out
if we stay the course,

31:24.617 --> 31:26.283
But you have to trust me.

31:26.285 --> 31:28.185
I need this hotel to succeed.

31:28.187 --> 31:29.186
We all do.

31:29.188 --> 31:30.888
No, you don't understand, okay?

31:30.890 --> 31:33.490
What do you mean
that you gave up everything?

31:33.492 --> 31:35.325
I gave up every...
I gave up jane.

31:35.327 --> 31:38.462
What do you...
What do you mean?

31:38.464 --> 31:40.931
Look, you've been gone
for a while, okay?

31:40.933 --> 31:42.032
A lot has happened.

31:42.034 --> 31:44.167
So, tell me.

31:44.169 --> 31:48.639
I mean, before all
this... Stuff happened...

31:53.177 --> 31:55.212
...We used to talk.

31:55.214 --> 31:57.080
That's all I want.

31:57.082 --> 31:59.049
Don't coddle me,
don't handle me.

31:59.051 --> 32:02.319
Just talk to me, please,
and not about business.

32:04.956 --> 32:08.292
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And so, rafael</i>
<i>told his sister everything.</i>

32:08.294 --> 32:10.494
How he asked jane to marry him.

32:10.496 --> 32:13.230
Dad died, but I had jane.

32:13.232 --> 32:16.500
I'd never felt so sure
about anything.

32:16.502 --> 32:18.435
Or anyone.

32:18.437 --> 32:20.037
<i>How she said "no."</i>

32:20.039 --> 32:22.239
I'm so sorry.

32:22.241 --> 32:24.107
<i>How he'd reached out</i>
<i>to his mother,</i>

32:24.109 --> 32:26.643
<i>How she took ten million</i>
<i>dollars to walk away from him.</i>

32:26.645 --> 32:28.645
If it helps, I always
hated your mother.

32:28.647 --> 32:30.514
(laughing)

32:30.516 --> 32:33.216
It does, actually.

32:33.218 --> 32:37.087
He even let her read the letter
his father wrote to his mother.

32:37.089 --> 32:40.190
Emilio: <i>And, of course,</i>
<i>I'm hard on rafael.</i>

32:40.192 --> 32:42.960
<i>But what he doesn't understand</i>
<i>is I am hard on him</i>

32:42.962 --> 32:45.128
<i>Because I believe</i>
<i>that he can be a success.</i>

32:45.130 --> 32:47.130
Rafael
so I can't let this hotel fail.

32:47.132 --> 32:49.466
I just can't.

32:49.468 --> 32:51.969
And it was failing,

32:51.971 --> 32:54.538
And I was disappointing jane.

32:54.540 --> 32:57.074
So, something had to give.

32:57.076 --> 32:58.475
I get it.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.110
(sighs)

33:00.112 --> 33:03.046
I just think you gave
up the wrong thing.

33:03.048 --> 33:08.618
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Which brings us back to jane,</i>
<i>who had a baby to turn.</i>

33:08.620 --> 33:10.454
<i>And she was about to burn moxa</i>

33:10.456 --> 33:12.522
<i>At her feet</i>
<i>in order to turn it.</i>

33:16.160 --> 33:19.429
<i>Google it.</i>
<i>It's a real thing.</i>

33:19.431 --> 33:21.431
â™ª

33:21.433 --> 33:23.467
<i>No partner, no problem.</i>

33:23.469 --> 33:26.770
<i>Because jane,</i>
<i>you'll remember, was handy.</i>

33:31.175 --> 33:32.776
(sighs, grunts)

33:32.778 --> 33:35.312
Luisa: <i>I get that</i>
<i>the hotel's important,</i>

33:35.314 --> 33:37.714
But this is also about
you rejecting jane

33:37.716 --> 33:40.317
Before she rejects
you, like your mom.

33:40.319 --> 33:42.185
No, no, no, that's not...

33:42.187 --> 33:45.622
It's part of the reason...
Since we're being honest.

33:45.624 --> 33:49.092
Look, the point is
that I did it, okay?

33:49.094 --> 33:51.728
And this hotel--
this is my kid's legacy,

33:51.730 --> 33:54.097
So I need it to work.

33:54.099 --> 33:55.499
Yeah, but then what?
What if it's successful?

33:55.501 --> 33:56.800
You're gonna be happy?

33:56.802 --> 33:58.502
Without jane?

33:58.504 --> 34:00.404
Maybe, you know, after
I get this stuff settled...

34:00.406 --> 34:01.738
What?

34:01.740 --> 34:04.307
She's gonna wait?

34:04.309 --> 34:06.510
Raf, people don't wait.

34:06.512 --> 34:09.046
They move on.

34:19.490 --> 34:21.224
Jane?

34:24.729 --> 34:26.063
(jane yelps)

34:28.699 --> 34:31.234
Burning moxa to turn the baby.
I must have fallen asleep.

34:32.136 --> 34:34.538
I-I know.

34:34.540 --> 34:36.506
I don't know!

34:40.812 --> 34:43.647
I... I just needed to prove
I can do it myself,

34:43.649 --> 34:46.183
Because I'm going to have
to do things myself now!

34:46.185 --> 34:47.551
And I know you're here,
but still,

34:47.553 --> 34:49.853
There are some things
I need to do on my own.

34:49.855 --> 34:51.688
Okay? As a single mother.

34:51.690 --> 34:53.590
(crying):
Because that's what I am.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.358
And I didn't see it coming,
abuela.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.260
And I'm just trying
to get my bearings,

34:57.262 --> 34:59.563
And I just want
to be able to do something.

34:59.565 --> 35:02.566
I just wanted to know
I can do something on my own.

35:02.568 --> 35:05.335
(crying)

35:18.116 --> 35:19.850
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And so, jane went</i>

35:19.852 --> 35:22.119
<i>To bed that night alone,</i>
<i>when suddenly--</i>

35:22.121 --> 35:24.554
<i>And it should be noted, quite</i>
<i>dramatically-- she woke up.</i>

35:24.556 --> 35:27.157
(sighing)

35:27.159 --> 35:31.561
<i>Because the baby turned.</i>
<i>She felt it turn.</i>

35:31.563 --> 35:35.298
We did it.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.534
Can I get a fist bump?

35:37.536 --> 35:39.903
Pow.

35:42.707 --> 35:44.841
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Also feeling victorious.</i>

35:44.843 --> 35:48.311
So tell me, were you
in magda and petra's room

35:48.313 --> 35:49.880
On the night in question?

35:49.882 --> 35:51.848
Yes, I was.

35:51.850 --> 35:54.184
<i>What? I can't believe</i>
<i>they found him already.</i>

35:54.186 --> 35:56.453
What were you doing there?

35:56.455 --> 36:00.157
I was called in to help
with a... Plumbing problem.

36:01.325 --> 36:02.726
What's the name
of your employer?

36:02.728 --> 36:06.429
Oh, I am what you call, uh,
self-employed.

36:06.431 --> 36:07.898
Here.

36:07.900 --> 36:10.333
You give me call
you have problem.

36:10.335 --> 36:14.371
I give you ten percent off,
friends and family discount.

36:14.373 --> 36:16.239
Petra:
<i>Thank you.</i>

36:16.241 --> 36:17.574
Do not thank me.

36:17.576 --> 36:19.309
I would like nothing more

36:19.311 --> 36:21.578
Than you and your miserable
mother be rotting in prison.

36:21.580 --> 36:24.447
I did this so milos
wouldn't kill me.

36:24.449 --> 36:27.417
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Say what you will about</i>
<i>psychopath ex-boyfriends,</i>

36:27.419 --> 36:29.252
<i>But sometimes</i>
<i>they buy you hotels</i>

36:29.254 --> 36:31.555
<i>And force former hostages</i>
<i>to lie on your behalf.</i>

36:31.557 --> 36:32.889
Can I go now?

36:32.891 --> 36:34.958
<i>Passions of santos</i>
<i>is coming on.</i>

36:34.960 --> 36:37.494
Santos is coming
back from the dead.

36:39.964 --> 36:42.632
Apparently,
I need tighter security.

36:42.634 --> 36:44.334
Please leave.
Wait.

36:44.336 --> 36:46.536
I'm just here to say

36:46.538 --> 36:48.872
That I accept your decision.

36:48.874 --> 36:52.375
So you can come over, hang
around jane and not worry.

36:52.377 --> 36:55.378
I get it. It's over, okay?

36:57.815 --> 37:01.518
Yes. Okay.

37:07.391 --> 37:09.526
Michael:
Jane, I'm so sorry.

37:09.528 --> 37:11.394
I wanted ivan
to be the answer.

37:11.396 --> 37:13.463
He is. He's lying.

37:13.465 --> 37:15.632
My grandmother said
he was yelling for help.
I know.

37:15.634 --> 37:18.802
So, then, what's going on?
I'm sorry.

37:18.804 --> 37:21.004
I'm... I'm just frustrated.

37:21.006 --> 37:23.540
I know. Jane?

37:23.542 --> 37:25.342
Listen, I want you
to be careful.

37:25.344 --> 37:27.244
Just 'cause
we haven't proven anything

37:27.246 --> 37:29.346
Doesn't mean something shady
isn't going on over there.

37:29.348 --> 37:31.348
Rafael's sister
luisa is back.

37:31.350 --> 37:33.016
She could still be
in contact with sin rostro.

37:33.018 --> 37:34.818
And with magda around,

37:34.820 --> 37:36.953
And petra lying to
cover for her, I just...

37:36.955 --> 37:38.955
I want you to
be careful.

37:38.957 --> 37:41.825
I will. Thank you.

37:41.827 --> 37:43.660
Yeah, of course.

37:43.662 --> 37:45.262
I should call my grandmother,
let her know.

37:45.264 --> 37:46.663
Yeah.

37:46.665 --> 37:48.298
(sighs)

37:48.300 --> 37:50.700
Edward:
Everything all right?

37:53.638 --> 37:54.904
(clears throat)

38:04.315 --> 38:08.318
If this did not happen,

38:08.320 --> 38:10.620
I would not have...

38:10.622 --> 38:14.057
My new friend.

38:16.594 --> 38:17.927
Alba...

38:20.665 --> 38:23.933
I'm fooling myself
to think we can just be friends.

38:27.038 --> 38:28.505
So I've been doing
some thinking,

38:28.507 --> 38:30.006
And I've decided

38:30.008 --> 38:32.676
You're right.

38:32.678 --> 38:35.312
Let's take out another loan,
ride out this period.

38:36.881 --> 38:39.482
So you're letting go
of the whole time-share pitch?

38:39.484 --> 38:41.484
It's a betrayal
to the marbella brand

38:41.486 --> 38:43.887
That you and your father
worked so hard to create.

38:43.889 --> 38:46.356
And I know what
that means to you.

38:47.892 --> 38:49.859
So, why the sudden change
of heart?

38:51.429 --> 38:53.630
I've just been thinking
about our partnership

38:53.632 --> 38:57.334
And how I should probably
compromise more to make it work.

38:58.803 --> 39:00.370
Which is why I've decided

39:00.372 --> 39:01.971
To find my mother
a different job.

39:04.041 --> 39:06.609
Thank you, petra.

39:08.512 --> 39:10.513
Oh, and for the record,

39:10.515 --> 39:12.682
Alba was confused
about the accident.

39:12.684 --> 39:15.819
These are the medical records
from my mother's surgery

39:15.821 --> 39:17.454
Last month
in the czech republic.

39:20.391 --> 39:21.991
My mother didn't
push alba downstairs.

39:21.993 --> 39:23.760
My mother couldn't
walk back then.

39:23.762 --> 39:25.362
Anyway...

39:28.399 --> 39:30.400
Magda:
<i>You want me to apologize?</i>

39:30.402 --> 39:32.402
And you're firing me?

39:32.404 --> 39:34.504
You said you want what's best
for me, mother, right?

39:34.506 --> 39:37.774
Uh-huh.
Well, I'm still
in love with rafael.

39:37.776 --> 39:40.810
And now, finally,
there's an opening.

39:40.812 --> 39:43.813
And I'm gonna get him back.

39:43.815 --> 39:46.416
Hey.
Oh, hi.

39:47.518 --> 39:49.886
Uh, how's it going?

39:49.888 --> 39:51.688
Any movement
with the baby?

39:51.690 --> 39:55.024
Oh, yeah, she turned
last night, actually.

39:55.026 --> 39:58.094
(laughs)
that's... That's great.

39:58.096 --> 40:00.063
Mm-hmm.

40:00.065 --> 40:01.598
Why didn't you tell me?

40:01.600 --> 40:03.500
Oh.

40:03.502 --> 40:06.469
It happened in the middle of the
night, and I knew I'd see you.

40:07.605 --> 40:09.139
Gotcha.

40:09.141 --> 40:12.609
Oh, um, so,
petra talked to her mother,

40:12.611 --> 40:15.011
And magda is leaving the hotel.

40:15.013 --> 40:17.947
Good. What about petra?

40:17.949 --> 40:19.549
Oh, yeah, she's...
She's apologetic.

40:19.551 --> 40:20.750
No, I mean,

40:20.752 --> 40:22.519
When is she leaving the hotel?

40:23.954 --> 40:26.556
She owns a third
of the marbella, jane.

40:27.958 --> 40:30.126
And she's an accomplice
to attempted murder.

40:30.128 --> 40:32.128
She lied to cover up the fact

40:32.130 --> 40:35.198
That her mother pushed
my grandmother down the stairs.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.801
Okay, look...
What?

40:37.803 --> 40:40.570
It's just that there are
two sides to every story.

40:40.572 --> 40:42.038
Excuse me?

40:42.040 --> 40:44.808
Your grandmother
had a head injury.

40:44.810 --> 40:46.543
She might not remember.

40:46.545 --> 40:48.678
And petra's mother
couldn't walk back then.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.180
Of course she could!

40:50.182 --> 40:52.115
She obviously
was faking her injury!

40:52.117 --> 40:53.783
For three years?
Yes!

40:53.785 --> 40:55.185
I lived with her, jane.

40:55.187 --> 40:57.654
She has medical records.
Well, she's evil,

40:57.656 --> 41:00.156
And so is her daughter, and
I don't want my kid around them.

41:00.158 --> 41:02.492
End of story.
Okay, it's not end of story,

41:02.494 --> 41:03.760
Because it's also my kid,

41:03.762 --> 41:05.495
And I can't just
get rid of petra.

41:05.497 --> 41:06.830
Well, I can't be around her.

41:07.798 --> 41:09.933
And I don't have to be.

41:09.935 --> 41:11.501
I quit.

41:11.503 --> 41:13.036
Wait. What?

41:13.038 --> 41:14.737
I'm removing myself
from the situation.

41:14.739 --> 41:16.639
Hold on. Stop. Jane, stop!

41:16.641 --> 41:18.641
Look, this is ridiculous, okay?

41:18.643 --> 41:21.511
I live here, I work here.
The baby is gonna be here.

41:21.513 --> 41:23.880
Quitting is
not the answer.

41:23.882 --> 41:26.649
Latin lover narrator:
And he was right, she realized.

41:26.651 --> 41:28.918
Jane:
<i>I have enough saved for now.</i>

41:28.920 --> 41:31.054
I'll get a new job
after the baby comes.

41:31.056 --> 41:34.557
If I have to go back to work
a few weeks earlier, I will.

41:34.559 --> 41:36.025
As long as you'll help me.

41:37.194 --> 41:38.995
Good.

41:40.231 --> 41:42.665
Because I thought
co-parenting with rafael

41:42.667 --> 41:44.934
Was best for the baby,
but I was wrong.

41:44.936 --> 41:46.703
His sister is connected
to sin rostro,

41:46.705 --> 41:48.671
And his crazy ex-wife
has a murderous mother.

41:48.673 --> 41:51.040
What are you saying, jane?

41:51.042 --> 41:54.811
That what's best for the baby is
to be as far from the marbella

41:54.813 --> 41:56.513
And all those people
as possible.

41:56.515 --> 41:58.047
So I'm calling a lawyer.

41:59.783 --> 42:01.551
I want full custody.
