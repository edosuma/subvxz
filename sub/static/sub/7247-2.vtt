Mr. Coldwater,
what did The Beast say to you?

00:37.988 --> 00:41.023
How did it know your name?

23:14.803 --> 23:16.002
How do you know?

23:16.004 --> 23:18.739
'Cause I know things.

23:18.741 --> 23:23.409
Like this place--
What? It's a gold mine.

23:23.411 --> 23:27.379
Look, you can't run away
from you.

23:27.381 --> 23:29.314
And, well, I'm here,
and I'm amazing,

23:29.316 --> 23:32.651
so I mean--
[laughs]

23:32.653 --> 23:35.520
I'll take it
under advisement, okay?

23:35.522 --> 23:37.156
Hey.

23:37.158 --> 23:38.824
No, leave us alone.

23:38.826 --> 23:40.726
Gladly, we just--
we've got to discuss, um--

23:40.728 --> 23:43.762
There you are, Quentin and Alice,

23:43.764 --> 23:45.830
and Penny and Kady.

23:45.832 --> 23:49.033
You're exactly
who I was looking for.

23:49.035 --> 23:51.836
I found
the most interesting thing

23:51.838 --> 23:53.872
buried in our woods.

23:56.408 --> 23:58.442
Follow me.

24:07.518 --> 24:09.753
We never
got near the mirror, I swear.

24:09.755 --> 24:12.289
We were studying, that's all.

24:12.291 --> 24:15.893
What language even is this?

24:15.895 --> 24:17.594
Yes, I mean, sure, I touched it.

24:17.596 --> 24:19.862
We all touched it.
I mean, I touched--

24:19.864 --> 24:22.731
[stuttering]
We were studying, so--

24:22.733 --> 24:25.802
Look, I'm just trying
to make sense of this.

24:25.804 --> 24:27.703
There's residue
all over this book,

24:27.705 --> 24:30.072
including a summoning

24:30.074 --> 24:32.175
we believe opened the door
to The Beast.

24:35.111 --> 24:37.078
What did you say?

24:37.080 --> 24:38.947
Nothing, I--

24:47.924 --> 24:50.558
Don't look at me.

24:50.560 --> 24:52.459
[sighs]

24:52.461 --> 24:54.962
Look, I know
they're your friends.

24:54.964 --> 24:56.463
[scoffs]

24:56.465 --> 24:58.632
Okay, at this point,
I just have to assume

24:58.634 --> 24:59.633
it was all of you.

24:59.635 --> 25:01.668
Yeah, well, it wasn't.

25:01.670 --> 25:05.439
Shut up and I'll tell you,
happily.

25:10.077 --> 25:12.345
It's fine, let's go.

25:12.347 --> 25:13.612
You're welcome, by the way.

25:18.518 --> 25:19.819
What does that mean?

25:22.689 --> 25:25.958
Quentin, can I see you, please?

25:25.960 --> 25:27.459
Alice, you're free to go.

25:29.662 --> 25:31.363
There's nothing
I can do in this moment

25:31.365 --> 25:34.566
to stop the comet from crashing
into the earth, is there?

25:38.222 --> 25:40.923
Hold on.

25:40.925 --> 25:42.892
Uh, what is this?

25:42.894 --> 25:44.693
My books.
I'm headed to return them.

25:44.695 --> 25:46.074
You've heard, I assume.

25:46.194 --> 25:48.264
Word travels fast
when you're life's over.

25:48.266 --> 25:50.732
Don't say that.

25:50.734 --> 25:53.668
They're bringing in
a Specialist.

25:53.670 --> 25:55.770
Yeah, thanks.
Ominous.

25:55.772 --> 25:57.205
I'm sorry.

25:59.275 --> 26:00.708
I don't know,
I keep trying to tell myself

26:00.710 --> 26:05.713
this is somehow better,
you know, not to know.

26:05.715 --> 26:08.715
'Cause who would want to know
that--that magic exists

26:08.717 --> 26:10.251
if there's nothing you can do
about it, you know,

26:10.253 --> 26:12.086
if there's no one to teach you
or help you.

26:12.088 --> 26:14.588
I...don't know
what to say.

26:14.590 --> 26:17.358
Of course you don't, because
nobody would rather not know.

26:17.360 --> 26:20.461
You don't see color
and want to go black and white.

26:20.463 --> 26:21.862
[sighs]

26:21.864 --> 26:24.630
You do not have to make me
feel better, we--

26:24.632 --> 26:26.899
really, we basically
just met each other.

26:26.901 --> 26:30.937
Well, I bond fast.
Time is an illusion.

26:30.939 --> 26:34.441
Look, don't go out there
and be the old you.

26:34.443 --> 26:36.076
How, Eliot?

26:36.078 --> 26:38.878
I go back there, and I'm...

26:38.880 --> 26:40.713
I'm a depressed super nerd.

26:40.715 --> 26:43.782
How about I find you,
and I don't say magic is real,

26:43.784 --> 26:46.751
but I do seduce you,
and so lift your spirits

26:46.753 --> 26:50.922
that life retains
its sparkle for decades.

26:50.924 --> 26:52.891
Yeah, that sounds nice.
Thank you.

26:52.893 --> 26:54.926
Okay.

26:57.797 --> 26:59.663
Is there any way
not to get wiped?

26:59.665 --> 27:01.432
I don't know.

27:01.434 --> 27:04.335
I've heard of the Specialist,
and all I can say is,

27:04.337 --> 27:05.836
I hear they're very good.

27:07.606 --> 27:08.806
[depositing coins]

27:08.808 --> 27:11.842
<i>[dialing numbers]</i>

27:13.912 --> 27:16.913
<i>[line trills]</i>

27:16.915 --> 27:20.783
<i>This is Julia, little busy.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

27:20.785 --> 27:22.486
<i>[beeps]</i>

27:22.488 --> 27:23.920
Hey, it's Q.

27:23.922 --> 27:27.524
<i>Look, I know</i>
<i>when we last met that--</i>

27:27.526 --> 27:29.792
<i>I'm sorry, Jules.</i>
<i>I am.</i>

27:29.794 --> 27:33.695
<i>I didn't know it,</i>
<i>what it must be like for you,</i>

27:33.697 --> 27:39.101
<i>and I-I, um, I hope that</i>
<i>you are doing better.</i>

27:39.103 --> 27:40.936
[grunts]

27:40.938 --> 27:42.271
Oh, my God,
you're just going for it.

27:42.273 --> 27:45.040
- Ugh.
- [grunting]

27:45.042 --> 27:47.976
Um, so I got expelled and they
are sending in a Specialist

27:47.978 --> 27:55.016
because the local brain wipe guy
is dead and--long story. Um--

27:57.186 --> 27:59.554
So if you remember
or you figured out

27:59.556 --> 28:01.989
why it didn't work on you,
I'd like to know that about now

28:01.991 --> 28:06.027
because I need you to remind me
<i>that magic is real.</i>

28:09.063 --> 28:12.866
Oh, yeah.
[laughing] Yeah.

28:12.868 --> 28:15.669
You know,
without Brakebills, it's just,

28:15.671 --> 28:17.937
I'm lost and you're not.

28:19.374 --> 28:21.007
Magic, oh ho.

28:21.009 --> 28:22.909
Okay.

28:22.911 --> 28:24.910
Let's find a way
out of this shit hole.

28:27.514 --> 28:29.048
You can't help
and I can't help you,

28:29.050 --> 28:30.716
and it's just--
<i>[beeps]</i>

28:30.718 --> 28:33.686
<i>To send your message, press one.</i>

28:33.688 --> 28:37.990
<i>To erase, press two.</i>

28:37.992 --> 28:39.692
<i>[long tone]</i>

28:39.694 --> 28:42.727
<i>Deleted.</i>

28:47.900 --> 28:49.467
Hey!

28:50.936 --> 28:54.806
Ho, ho, ho,
you little piece of shit.

28:58.210 --> 29:00.043
- You ratted me out.
- I told the truth.

29:00.045 --> 29:01.579
- Not all of it.
- Oh, am I a fool?

29:01.581 --> 29:03.214
- [groans]
- Apparently not.

29:03.216 --> 29:06.116
- Get off!
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

29:06.118 --> 29:08.952
[groans]

29:33.743 --> 29:35.410
What the hell was that,
you maniac?

29:35.412 --> 29:37.246
Hey!
Step back, both of you!

29:37.248 --> 29:38.247
Who shot off that spell?

29:38.249 --> 29:42.083
- He did!
- I did.

29:42.085 --> 29:45.120
Infirmary, both of you, now.

29:51.960 --> 29:53.994
Figured it out.

29:53.996 --> 29:56.464
The spell, or, you know,
the whole point,

29:56.466 --> 29:59.066
that there isn't one--
not to get out of the room,

29:59.068 --> 30:01.902
not to
keep the door locked, nada.

30:01.904 --> 30:03.471
Cute, Pete.

30:03.473 --> 30:05.838
Oh, and scissors make
a shitty screw driver,

30:05.840 --> 30:08.875
by the way.

30:15.750 --> 30:17.150
Good for you.

30:17.152 --> 30:19.352
Now you get why
it was so important.

30:19.354 --> 30:21.254
To almost die for no reason?

30:21.256 --> 30:22.321
To figure out
that not everything

30:22.323 --> 30:24.623
gets solved by magic.

30:24.625 --> 30:26.625
Key fact if you want
to last the month.

30:26.627 --> 30:27.826
You're not still debating

30:27.828 --> 30:28.994
letting me into your club,
are you?

30:28.996 --> 30:31.029
Hey, I invited you.

30:31.031 --> 30:33.265
No, you attacked me in a bar,

30:33.267 --> 30:35.033
in the bathroom, on my birthday.

30:35.035 --> 30:36.669
I'm done trying
to prove myself to you.

30:36.671 --> 30:39.470
You weren't.

30:39.472 --> 30:42.507
You were trying
to prove yourself to me.

30:46.978 --> 30:49.013
That means level 50.

30:50.616 --> 30:52.784
Um...

30:52.786 --> 30:56.053
Uh, wait,
s-so you were--

30:56.055 --> 30:58.955
Top bitch in New York, for starters.

30:58.957 --> 31:00.691
Um, and this was--

31:00.693 --> 31:03.327
Me discovering how much I like you.

31:03.329 --> 31:05.995
You are smart.
You're passionate.

31:05.997 --> 31:07.163
You question things.

31:07.165 --> 31:08.465
You messed with my head!

31:08.467 --> 31:09.999
Think about how much you learned

31:10.001 --> 31:11.802
about how to do that
for when you're level 50.

31:11.804 --> 31:13.236
[scoffs]

31:13.238 --> 31:14.670
- Hey, don't be mad.
- Don't be mad.

31:14.672 --> 31:16.505
How am I supposed to trust you?

31:16.507 --> 31:19.508
Why would you ever trust anyone?

31:19.510 --> 31:20.909
I am willing to teach
the right people

31:20.911 --> 31:25.648
everything I know,
and I know a lot,

31:25.650 --> 31:29.184
because I have certain
connections in certain places,

31:29.186 --> 31:32.920
just like, for instance,
Brakebills.

31:35.190 --> 31:37.024
Brakebills.

31:37.026 --> 31:38.192
You want a drink?

31:38.194 --> 31:40.228
Let's get a drink.

31:47.067 --> 31:48.463
Might burn a little.

31:48.589 --> 31:49.621
This is why you're not
supposed to throw

31:49.623 --> 31:51.757
this kind of magic around.

31:51.759 --> 31:53.792
If you're lucky I can fix this.

31:53.794 --> 31:55.261
You're lucky
you're not expelled.

31:55.263 --> 31:56.695
Yeah, so lucky.

32:02.435 --> 32:06.204
Ooh.
That's actually--

32:06.206 --> 32:07.338
[sucks in air]

32:07.340 --> 32:08.472
[screams]

32:08.474 --> 32:09.507
Hold still, please.

32:09.509 --> 32:12.043
[groaning]

32:12.045 --> 32:14.279
[whimpering]

32:14.281 --> 32:16.180
- Pussy.
- Nobody asked you.

32:16.182 --> 32:18.883
Me, the guy
you threw battle magic at?

32:18.885 --> 32:20.651
Hey, have you heard of karma?

32:20.653 --> 32:23.120
Well, sometimes it's instant.

32:23.122 --> 32:24.821
You're welcome.

32:24.823 --> 32:27.457
What is that?
How--how did you--

32:27.459 --> 32:29.859
Real Magicians protect themselves.

32:29.861 --> 32:32.495
Would somebody please
sign him out of here?

32:32.497 --> 32:34.697
[laughs]

32:34.699 --> 32:38.635
<i>[sighs]</i><i>She's late.</i>

32:38.637 --> 32:40.136
<i>She's coming.</i>

32:40.138 --> 32:43.072
<i>Or she's just</i>
<i>done with your shit.</i>

32:43.074 --> 32:46.108
She doesn't have the option.

32:50.814 --> 32:52.048
Finally.

32:53.883 --> 32:55.351
Hey, look,
that thing you wanted,

32:55.353 --> 32:57.518
that charm or crystal
or whatever?

32:57.520 --> 32:59.988
The Emerson's Alloy Repellant?

32:59.990 --> 33:03.158
Yeah, this guy I was with,
he grabbed it.

33:03.160 --> 33:05.660
Look, I'll find you
another one, okay?

33:05.662 --> 33:07.329
And more.

33:07.331 --> 33:09.530
Here.

33:09.532 --> 33:10.898
There's a ton
of good shit in there.

33:10.900 --> 33:13.500
Hmm, listen to all that
backpedaling.

33:13.502 --> 33:15.602
I'll get it, okay?

33:15.604 --> 33:19.073
Whatever you want.
I'll find you another one.

33:19.075 --> 33:21.775
Great.
You're a sweet girl, Kady.

33:21.777 --> 33:23.577
You're a heartless bitch.

33:23.579 --> 33:26.746
I'm generous with you,
considering.

33:29.717 --> 33:32.452
Get me everything on this list,
this week.

33:33.954 --> 33:35.921
Thanks so much.

33:35.923 --> 33:37.423
You better get back to bed, hon.

33:37.425 --> 33:38.905
I'm sure you got class
in the morning.

34:18.730 --> 34:20.664
- Hi.
- Oh.

34:20.666 --> 34:24.567
Caught me where I'm not
meant to be, a terminal snooper.

34:24.569 --> 34:28.737
How are you, Quentin?
I heard about the attack.

34:28.739 --> 34:32.074
You--you were--you were there
the day of the alumni interview.

34:32.077 --> 34:34.110
I--
You were a paramedic.

34:34.112 --> 34:35.777
Call me Eliza.

34:35.780 --> 34:39.581
I was there that day
to make sure that you got here.

34:39.583 --> 34:41.150
Oh.

34:41.152 --> 34:47.156
Well, uh, thank you,
but I kind of screwed that up.

34:47.158 --> 34:48.657
Um...

34:48.659 --> 34:50.426
They're calling in a Specialist.

34:50.428 --> 34:54.563
He's supposed to wipe it all
away like it never happened.

34:55.697 --> 34:59.833
That sounds--
Hmm.

34:59.835 --> 35:04.772
You know, I'm the Specialist?
Sorry.

35:04.774 --> 35:06.674
Shall we sit?

35:08.677 --> 35:12.446
Okay.
Okay.

35:12.448 --> 35:15.014
Okay.

35:15.016 --> 35:18.818
Um, just before,
um, can I--

35:18.820 --> 35:20.520
Why did you give me that book?

35:21.989 --> 35:24.057
"Fillory and Further," book six.

35:24.059 --> 35:25.992
I thought you'd appreciate it.

35:25.994 --> 35:27.026
I lost it.

35:27.028 --> 35:28.128
Guess I was wrong.

35:28.130 --> 35:30.196
No, you're not, I--

35:30.198 --> 35:32.898
I need to read it.
I just, I can't find it.

35:32.900 --> 35:35.501
Things with "Fillory"
are funny that way.

35:37.404 --> 35:39.171
Is "Fillory" real?

35:39.173 --> 35:42.674
Why even ask if you'll just
forget it again?

35:42.676 --> 35:45.511
The books,
they're just--

35:45.513 --> 35:48.513
They always felt
realer than anything.

35:48.515 --> 35:49.981
Then it's real.

35:49.983 --> 35:51.849
That's not a real answer.

35:51.851 --> 35:53.218
Shall we begin?

35:57.523 --> 36:00.225
- Okay, do it.
- [chuckles]

36:00.227 --> 36:03.860
Oh, Quentin, I am pleased!

36:03.862 --> 36:05.662
What?
Why?

36:05.664 --> 36:09.266
You're a much better liar
than I expected you to be.

36:09.268 --> 36:10.834
Can I level with you?

36:10.836 --> 36:13.069
I wish you would.

36:13.071 --> 36:16.273
You're not very remarkable.

36:16.275 --> 36:19.409
You're smart, but no genius.

36:19.411 --> 36:22.612
You do magic,
but nothing special.

36:22.614 --> 36:25.281
And the worst is,
you're so eager to belong,

36:25.283 --> 36:26.882
you even forget why you're here.

36:26.884 --> 36:28.317
Why am I here?

36:33.690 --> 36:37.892
You dreamed of it, didn't you,

36:37.894 --> 36:42.531
"Fillory," before the attack,
like a warning?

36:42.533 --> 36:44.466
Yeah, did you--
how did you?

36:44.468 --> 36:46.134
Because I've dreamed of it too.

36:49.071 --> 36:51.906
And I've looked
into that Beast's eyes.

36:51.908 --> 36:53.608
What?

36:53.610 --> 36:56.943
Do you think you have a destiny?

36:56.945 --> 36:58.379
Um, yes.

36:58.381 --> 37:00.013
Yeah.

37:00.015 --> 37:03.250
I used to believe that crap too
when I was young.

37:03.252 --> 37:08.422
There is no destiny,
no born heroes.

37:08.424 --> 37:09.923
I can't tell you why--

37:09.925 --> 37:12.625
why The Beast came
sniffing for you.

37:12.627 --> 37:15.695
There's no reason
it should be you.

37:15.697 --> 37:18.665
You can either step up to it
or not, it's up to you.

37:18.667 --> 37:21.801
We'll just hope for the best.

37:21.803 --> 37:23.369
Who are you?

37:23.371 --> 37:25.971
Just another inadequate Magician

37:25.973 --> 37:28.940
who's lost people.

37:28.942 --> 37:31.843
So will you if you don't
get strong.

37:31.845 --> 37:35.847
Learn fast, any means necessary.

37:35.849 --> 37:37.882
Which is why I'm so pleased
to see you sitting there

37:37.884 --> 37:40.219
like you don't have
an Emerson's in your pocket

37:40.221 --> 37:42.454
to repel any spell
to wipe your mind.

37:42.456 --> 37:43.822
You stole that.

37:43.824 --> 37:45.323
Who stole it?

37:46.825 --> 37:50.060
Relax, nobody's taking
your mind today.

37:50.062 --> 37:52.296
We'll make something of you yet.

37:52.298 --> 37:55.566
I'll tell the school
one more chance, probation.

37:55.568 --> 37:58.502
They'll respect my call.

37:58.504 --> 38:01.472
Don't make me regret it.

38:01.474 --> 38:03.240
Don't hop back
on the garden path

38:03.242 --> 38:05.308
like some little lemming,

38:05.310 --> 38:07.677
or I'll erase everything
and start you over entirely,

38:07.679 --> 38:09.145
