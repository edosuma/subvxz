00:59.293 --> 01:00.759
  - WHAT'S A MARGARITA, WILL?

01:00.761 --> 01:03.262
    - IT'S LIKE A SNOW CONE
       OF BAD DECISIONS.

01:03.264 --> 01:04.328

 - HAVE YOU BEEN GOING THROUGH
         MY CELL PHONE?

01:10.304 --> 01:12.171
 - SOMETIMES IT'S THE BEST WAY
    TO GET TO KNOW A PERSON.

01:12.173 --> 01:13.639
          PERSONALLY,
   I WOULD'VE DRAWN THE LINE

01:13.641 --> 01:15.240
   AT FIVE UNRETURNED CALLS,

01:15.242 --> 01:18.710

  YOU'RE NOT THE GUY WHO CALLS
    A GIRL A MILLION TIMES.

          NEVER AGAIN!
         YOU KNOW WHY?

01:46.173 --> 01:49.208
 BECAUSE IT'S GETTING PATHETIC.
        YOU'RE PATHETIC.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.342
    - NO, BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:50.344 --> 01:52.177
          ALTHOUGH...

01:52.179 --> 01:53.579
  IF I WERE TO THROW A PARTY,

01:53.581 --> 01:55.380
  THEN IT WOULDN'T BE PATHETIC
            TO CALL,

01:55.382 --> 01:57.182
  OR EVEN GO BY THE HOSPITAL,

01:57.184 --> 01:58.383

I WANNA BE INDEPENDENTLY WEALTHY
        WHEN I GROW UP.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.567
           - DARLING,
    I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND

02:15.569 --> 02:17.870
    THAT THERE IS GREAT JOY
 THAT COMES FROM EARNING MONEY

02:17.872 --> 02:19.505
     FROM A JOB WELL DONE.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.306
      - THERE'S ALSO A JOY
          FROM BUYING

02:21.308 --> 02:23.442
    A $500 MARGARITA MACHINE
         TO BAG A BABE.

02:23.444 --> 02:25.477

   YOU COULD BE A BLACKSMITH.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.389

YOU REALLY GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY
         WITH THAT ONE,

02:39.360 --> 02:40.759
 BUT WE CLEAN THEM AFTERWARDS.

02:40.761 --> 02:43.829

            - WELL--

           KINGS GET!

02:46.200 --> 02:47.499
    COULD YOU MAKE ME KING?

02:47.501 --> 02:50.269
    - NO, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
   THEY'RE CHOSEN AT RANDOM.

02:50.271 --> 02:51.503
       - I WANNA BE KING.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.305
        I <i> MUST</i> BE KING!

02:56.276 --> 02:59.645
   - OH, I SHOULD'VE MADE IT
          A REPUBLIC.

     - HEY! JAWS IS MAKING
    HIS FINAL APPROACH, MAN.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.883

        - THERE'S NO WAY

03:05.953 --> 03:07.419
     THAT THING IS STERILE.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.288
       IT COULD LITERALLY
    KILL SOMEONE--MAYBE ME.

         BUT NOW I CAN.
      AND DO YOU KNOW WHY?

06:07.401 --> 06:08.800
     - BECAUSE THE MAILMAN
      COMES AND GIVES YOU

    FOR MY STATION IN LIFE.

      - OH, I DON'T THINK
      IT SHOULD BE PUBLIC.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.393

20:41.941 --> 20:43.441
   THAT WRECKED MINI SOCIETY.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.743
 - UH, THAT IS I, WILL FREEMAN.
         UH, WHAT'S UP?

20:45.745 --> 20:48.980
          - 100 BUCKS
   TO FINISH THE JOB FOR YOU.

20:48.982 --> 20:51.916
        - WELL, I THINK
  THAT'S YOUR DECISION, BUDDY.

20:51.918 --> 20:54.385
   BUT I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU
         TO TAKE A LOOK

20:54.387 --> 20:56.621
 AT HOW MANY DISGUSTING CHAIRS
      THERE ARE TO SCRAPE,

20:56.623 --> 20:58.856
    AND THE FACT THAT I HAVE
     A C-NOTE IN MY POCKET

20:58.858 --> 21:00.258
          AS I SPEAK.

21:02.494 --> 21:03.928
         - NO, THANKS.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.763
       WE'RE GONNA ENJOY
        THE SATISFACTION

21:05.765 --> 21:07.598
      OF A JOB WELL DONE.
      - THAT'S GREAT, MAN.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.766
   THAT'S REALLY GREAT, YEAH.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.501
        I WAS JUST, UH,
      TOTALLY TESTING YOU,

21:10.503 --> 21:12.770
       AND YOU PASSED...
           SO, UH...

21:12.772 --> 21:14.905
          OH, MM-HMM.

21:14.907 --> 21:15.940
             OKAY.

21:17.042 --> 21:19.310
            [groans]

21:22.781 --> 21:24.815
