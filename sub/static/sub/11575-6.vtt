00:06.424 --> 00:07.459
Trick!

00:07.717 --> 00:09.048
--This is not Kenzi!
--You're hurting me, Bo-Bo!

00:09.302 --> 00:10.917
Don't call me that!
Kenzi calls me that!

00:11.179 --> 00:11.668
Where is she?!

00:11.929 --> 00:13.135
What are you doing?!
Dyson!

00:13.389 --> 00:13.969
KENZI: Let go!

00:14.223 --> 00:15.838
Gimme my friend,
we got a deal, Bitch!

00:16.100 --> 00:16.805
Bar's closed!

00:17.059 --> 00:18.265
I am your friend, Bo-Bo!

00:18.519 --> 00:19.759
Don't call me that!

00:20.021 --> 00:21.727
Everyone out! Now!

00:22.398 --> 00:23.763
Bo, Bo.
What's going on?

00:24.025 --> 00:26.141
I know it looks like
Kenzi, but it's not her.

00:26.402 --> 00:27.482
I didn't just grab you!

00:27.737 --> 00:28.726
She's lying!
Trick, she's lying!

00:28.988 --> 00:31.149
Stop it!
One at a time.

00:32.617 --> 00:33.948
Bo is killing again.

00:34.202 --> 00:34.736
Yes!

00:34.994 --> 00:36.530
How dare you!

00:37.413 --> 00:39.074
Let go of me!
She's lying--

00:39.332 --> 00:40.697
Bo-Bo, please.

00:40.958 --> 00:43.119
Please, I'm just
trying to help you!

00:43.377 --> 00:44.366
TRICK: We all are.

00:44.629 --> 00:45.914
I need you to be calm.

00:46.172 --> 00:47.787
How do you know
this isn't Kenzi?

00:48.049 --> 00:50.756
| just know.
In my bones I know.

00:51.010 --> 00:52.591
I need something
more than that.

00:53.012 --> 00:56.175
When I told her that I thought
I might be killing again?

00:56.432 --> 00:57.763
She didn't care.

00:58.017 --> 01:01.384
Trick, it is not Kenzi,
lam telling you.

01:04.065 --> 01:05.851
You see?

01:08.194 --> 01:09.354
Put her in holding.

01:09.612 --> 01:11.568
Yes, please.
Thank you.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.278
We have to figure out
what happened to her.

01:13.532 --> 01:14.282
In the Keg Room.

01:14.533 --> 01:15.568
No! Not me! Her!

01:15.826 --> 01:17.362
--Trick.
--Bo, we're going
to figure this out.

01:17.620 --> 01:19.360
You don't believe me!
You have to believe me!

01:19.622 --> 01:20.202
DYSON:
Sorry, Bo.

01:20.456 --> 01:21.571
Trick, Kenzi is in trouble!

01:21.832 --> 01:22.742
Trick, look at her!

01:23.000 --> 01:25.537
She's lying, Trick!

01:27.630 --> 01:29.962
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

01:30.841 --> 01:33.127
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

01:33.844 --> 01:35.800
My love carries
a death sentence.

01:36.639 --> 01:38.800
l was lost for years...

01:39.058 --> 01:40.923
Searching while hiding...

01:41.644 --> 01:44.727
Only to find that I belong
to a world hidden from humans.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.346
I won't hide anymore.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.350
I will live the life
I choose.

01:57.535 --> 01:58.285
Lauren should
be here by now.

01:58.536 --> 02:00.447
You need the girlfriend
to sign off on Bo's arrest?

02:00.705 --> 02:02.866
How many more Fae have
to die before you wake up?

02:03.124 --> 02:04.204
Bo is not a killer.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.164
It's time we take her
to the Dark Fae Compound.

02:06.419 --> 02:08.159
Enough!

02:08.421 --> 02:10.161
My granddaughter stays
here until we figure out

02:10.423 --> 02:11.162
what's going on.

02:11.424 --> 02:12.709
Lauren will be
here any minute,

02:12.967 --> 02:15.800
and she'll run some tests.
Until then, we keep Bo safe!

02:16.053 --> 02:18.009
Who died
and made you King?

02:18.431 --> 02:19.591
No one.

02:19.849 --> 02:21.589
And as the proprietor
of this way station

02:21.851 --> 02:23.967
l have the right
to declare sanctuary.

02:24.228 --> 02:25.468
[Slam]

02:33.821 --> 02:34.731
Hey.

02:34.989 --> 02:36.229
You okay?

02:36.866 --> 02:38.447
Poor Bo-Bo.

02:39.118 --> 02:40.779
Look, she
didn't mean it.

02:41.037 --> 02:41.617
Any of it.

02:41.871 --> 02:43.782
She's just...
sick, or something.

02:44.040 --> 02:47.498
But how could she think
that-- that I'm not me?

02:47.752 --> 02:49.868
Who else would I be?

02:50.212 --> 02:51.588
I don't know.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.750
But she's
gonna be okay.

02:54.008 --> 02:56.875
I'm just, l'm freaking
out. It's my best friend.

02:57.136 --> 02:58.922
I know.

03:00.056 --> 03:02.012
Dyson, a word?

03:04.226 --> 03:05.511
I'll be back.

03:07.396 --> 03:08.476
Can't wait.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.147
What do you
need me to do?

03:12.401 --> 03:14.141
I told you to
look out for her.

03:14.403 --> 03:15.734
To watch her.

03:15.988 --> 03:17.728
That's what I
needed you to do.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.366
Trick, l have
been watching her.

03:19.617 --> 03:20.732
How long?

03:20.993 --> 03:21.857
How long what?

03:22.119 --> 03:25.202
How long have you suspected
Bo has been killing again?

03:28.000 --> 03:30.377
We found two bodies
in the last few weeks.

03:31.170 --> 03:32.376
We think they're
Succubus feeds,

03:32.630 --> 03:33.540
but we're not sure.

03:33.798 --> 03:35.163
I don't care
if you're sure.

03:35.424 --> 03:37.801
You tell me
when it happens.

03:38.052 --> 03:39.041
That's your job.

03:39.303 --> 03:42.045
That's always been your
job to watch over her!

03:42.848 --> 03:44.349
That was three
years ago, Trick.

03:44.600 --> 03:45.760
That is not the point.

03:46.018 --> 03:46.973
Then what
is the point?!

03:47.228 --> 03:48.263
The point is--!

03:50.189 --> 03:51.804
I thought
I chose wisely.

03:52.650 --> 03:55.141
Maybe I was wrong.

04:03.828 --> 04:04.943
[Sigh]

04:07.998 --> 04:08.987
Hey.

04:11.836 --> 04:14.168
So, sorry your friend
turned crazy psychobitch.

04:14.422 --> 04:15.582
You're so not.

04:17.425 --> 04:18.665
Still.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.587
Must really
suck for you.

04:20.845 --> 04:22.005
Thanks.

04:22.430 --> 04:23.590
She really confessed?

04:24.223 --> 04:26.635
Another rough sex game
gone wrong for 30-30.

04:26.892 --> 04:27.756
It happens.

04:28.018 --> 04:29.303
If you're a Succubus.

04:31.897 --> 04:33.637
But earlier you
gave her an alibi.

04:35.109 --> 04:37.691
Earlier I wasn't
scared for my life.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.945
Must be horrible to hear
Bo say all those things.

04:42.992 --> 04:44.357
Best friends fight.

04:48.998 --> 04:50.579
Is there a problem?

04:52.001 --> 04:53.741
You really don't
like me, do you?

04:54.003 --> 04:55.163
You...

04:55.421 --> 04:57.958
you have been trying to
put my BFF in jail forever.

04:58.215 --> 05:01.707
So no--
not a big fan of that.

05:04.555 --> 05:07.342
Gee...
such a shame.

05:08.225 --> 05:10.682
I'm gonna go home and grab
some stuff for Bo-Bo.

05:10.936 --> 05:14.144
Rehab is rough and no one
makes care packages like moi.

05:14.398 --> 05:16.764
So, Peace!
Bottle blonde.

05:22.198 --> 05:23.358
Good chat.

05:24.200 --> 05:33.666
[Bo struggling]

05:33.918 --> 05:35.158
Oh! Oh!

05:35.419 --> 05:37.956
Thank God you're here!
I knew you'd come.

05:38.214 --> 05:40.671
Did you manage to talk
some sense into them?

05:41.008 --> 05:43.590
Bo, I need to take a
sample of your hair.

05:43.844 --> 05:44.674
What?

05:44.929 --> 05:47.170
lneed
a DNA sample.

05:47.431 --> 05:49.797
You need to help
me get out of here.

05:54.188 --> 05:55.553
Not you.

05:57.024 --> 05:57.979
I'm sorry.

05:59.985 --> 06:01.941
YouWe
sorry?

06:02.821 --> 06:05.107
Kenzi is out
there somewhere.

06:05.991 --> 06:06.980
She could be hurt.

06:07.243 --> 06:09.450
She could be
really hurt!

06:09.703 --> 06:12.115
Just let me take a sample
and I can help you.

06:12.373 --> 06:13.783
It's the only way
I know how--

06:14.041 --> 06:15.372
How can you
not believe me?

06:15.626 --> 06:16.490
Look at you!

06:16.752 --> 06:17.787
You're acting crazy.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.001
Because Kenzi
is missing!

06:22.424 --> 06:24.506
Are you scared of me?

06:25.636 --> 06:27.422
Are you?

06:27.846 --> 06:29.586
Look, you're sick, baby.

06:30.432 --> 06:32.889
And I can help you.

06:45.406 --> 06:47.567
I will never
forgive you for this.

06:50.202 --> 06:51.942
Well, I hope
that's not true.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.951
Look, everything is
going to be okay, sweetie.

06:57.209 --> 06:59.200
You're right.

06:59.461 --> 07:00.587
Just as soon as
| get out of here

07:00.838 --> 07:02.169
and figure out what
happened to Kenzi.

07:02.423 --> 07:04.163
Will you please just
give me some time?

07:04.425 --> 07:06.381
Time?

07:06.635 --> 07:07.795
Sure.

07:09.013 --> 07:11.129
But if Kenzi dies,
it's on you.

07:13.017 --> 07:15.008
| just want you
to know that.

07:16.020 --> 07:17.885
Sweetie.

07:26.196 --> 07:27.276
Who's there?

07:28.991 --> 07:29.946
Bo?

07:31.827 --> 07:32.987
Hi.

07:33.245 --> 07:35.076
Ugh, you should have
seen me with le gang.

07:35.331 --> 07:37.447
l was so good!

07:39.460 --> 07:41.166
What is that outfit?

07:41.420 --> 07:43.206
Bo and I did
a little shopping.

07:43.464 --> 07:44.954
If you're going
to rip off my look,

07:45.215 --> 07:46.955
at least respect
the Kenzi brand.

07:47.217 --> 07:49.378
God,
you look disgusting.

07:50.429 --> 07:52.135
Ever heard of blush?

07:58.187 --> 08:00.769
I got this for you.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.143
Bon appetit.

08:05.819 --> 08:06.979
Are you serious?

08:07.988 --> 08:09.364
Ungrateful-much?

08:09.615 --> 08:11.355
An earring isn't food!

08:11.617 --> 08:12.982
l'm starving!

08:13.410 --> 08:14.991
You ate three days ago.

08:15.245 --> 08:16.155
Exactly!

08:16.413 --> 08:18.574
Okay, call me crazy
but eating every day is

08:18.832 --> 08:20.743
a bit much,
don't you think?

08:21.001 --> 08:22.741
Which reminds me...

08:23.003 --> 08:25.164
What kind of ice
cream does Bo like?

08:25.422 --> 08:27.754
You stay away from her.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.964
I'm just trying to help.

08:30.427 --> 08:31.177
Let's be honest.

08:31.428 --> 08:33.510
Your friendship
needs a little reno.

08:34.640 --> 08:37.723
Besties aren't supposed
to have secrets.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.724
We don't have any secrets.

08:39.978 --> 08:41.104
ReaHy?

08:41.605 --> 08:43.891
Then why couldn't you
tell Bo about your rash?

08:45.818 --> 08:47.729
How do you know
about my rash?

08:47.986 --> 08:49.726
Where do you think
you got it from?

08:49.988 --> 08:51.569
The Norn.

08:53.826 --> 08:54.941
What was in
the bottle that--

08:55.202 --> 08:57.739
Spilled all
over your arm?

08:57.996 --> 08:59.952
My powers.

09:00.624 --> 09:02.080
Don't you get it?!

09:02.334 --> 09:05.576
My abilities were yours.

09:05.838 --> 09:07.874
You were, like, Fae.

09:08.132 --> 09:10.373
What do you mean...
I was Fae?

09:10.634 --> 09:13.717
Aww...
Just like a human.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.798
Didn't even know
what you had.

09:16.432 --> 09:17.842
I've been meaning
to thank you...

09:18.100 --> 09:21.934
It is so awesome getting
my glamour back.

09:22.479 --> 09:23.935
You are so crazy.

09:24.189 --> 09:25.440
Bo-Bo doesn't
think so.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.356
Actually,
she thinks I'm you.

09:29.194 --> 09:30.775
She'll never buy it.

09:32.990 --> 09:34.196
Sweetie...

09:34.992 --> 09:36.948
Don't worry.
Okay?

09:37.202 --> 09:40.319
lam gonna be such
a good friend to Bo.

09:41.039 --> 09:43.781
God knows she needs me,
especially now.

09:45.836 --> 09:47.792
Be happy for us.

09:48.213 --> 09:49.589
What do you
want from me?!

09:49.840 --> 09:52.752
What do you
want from me?!

09:54.845 --> 09:58.303
Dyson can smell Fae.

09:58.557 --> 10:00.718
He'll save me!
He always does!

10:01.018 --> 10:02.679
Not if | top up.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.097
Mmm...
Just what I need:

10:05.355 --> 10:06.310
[Sniffing]

10:08.817 --> 10:11.024
Mmmm, a little
more eau d'Kenzi.

10:12.821 --> 10:13.810
Dyson, Bo...

10:14.072 --> 10:16.688
They're all going to come
for me, you psycho!

10:19.036 --> 10:21.152
You sad, silly girl.

10:22.206 --> 10:23.787
Your friends don't
even know you're

10:24.041 --> 10:25.406
[Snarling]
missing!

10:29.838 --> 10:30.463
Hm.

10:30.714 --> 10:34.582
Oh, and I left some
not-so-friendlys outside.

10:47.606 --> 10:51.224
I've got
a surprise for you.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.101
What is that smell?

10:54.363 --> 10:56.729
It smells like
dirt or clay.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.105
Or coconut!

10:59.117 --> 11:00.903
Your favourite!

11:01.829 --> 11:03.945
I'm not hungry.

11:06.041 --> 11:08.202
I'll leave it
here for later.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.796
Actually...

11:19.638 --> 11:21.378
I changed my mind.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.721
Whoever you are.

11:23.976 --> 11:27.139
Please, just--
Call me Kenzi.

11:27.396 --> 11:29.011
Okay.

11:29.273 --> 11:30.353
Kenzi.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.148
I'll have some
ice cream.

11:44.830 --> 11:46.366
You know...

11:46.623 --> 11:47.954
We could
all be friends.

11:48.834 --> 11:50.790
Together.

11:51.044 --> 11:55.754
We'll go get Kenzi
and then all is forgiven.

11:56.008 --> 11:58.920
That is all
I've ever wanted.

11:59.553 --> 12:01.919
I knew you
could love me.

12:04.141 --> 12:06.723
I really think we are
in such a good place.

12:06.977 --> 12:08.137
Me, too.

12:08.979 --> 12:11.721
Just let me out of here
and we'll all be happy.

12:11.982 --> 12:14.473
But we don't
need Kenzi.

12:14.735 --> 12:15.941
You have me now.

12:16.194 --> 12:18.776
I will be a much
better best friend.

12:19.031 --> 12:19.360
[Gasp]

12:19.615 --> 12:20.730
I doubt that.

12:20.991 --> 12:23.733
Because my best friend knows
I hate coconut ice cream.

12:23.994 --> 12:25.154
Kenzi's alive.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.528
And she's made you
her little messenger.

12:28.624 --> 12:30.160
Ugh--
That bitch!

12:31.126 --> 12:34.584
That lying
human bitch!

12:35.213 --> 12:36.373
Ugh!

12:36.632 --> 12:38.168
Why does this
keep happening?!

12:38.634 --> 12:40.590
Why does this
keep happening?!

12:43.013 --> 12:45.755
None of you
will be my friend!

12:46.016 --> 12:47.756
[Crying]

12:48.018 --> 12:49.554
Why does this
keep happening?

12:49.811 --> 12:52.063
Maybe because you're
completely insane.

12:54.816 --> 12:57.353
Well, you're the one
they've locked up.

12:57.611 --> 12:58.396
If you hurt her--

12:58.654 --> 13:00.235
You miss Kenzi?

13:01.615 --> 13:03.151
Well,
take a good look,

13:03.408 --> 13:06.366
'cause this is the last time
you'll ever see her face.

13:07.037 --> 13:08.072
Rawr!

13:10.374 --> 13:11.910
Dyson!

13:13.752 --> 13:14.867
Oh, thank God!

13:15.128 --> 13:17.244
She's trying
to hurt me again!

13:17.839 --> 13:18.749
What's going on here?

13:19.007 --> 13:20.747
She's gone totally
Hannibal Lector.

13:21.009 --> 13:22.715
I told you not
to come in here.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.756
Dyson, please!

13:25.013 --> 13:27.129
Look at her!

13:35.774 --> 13:37.230
Come on.

13:49.830 --> 13:50.785
You texted?

13:51.039 --> 13:52.279
Heard the good news.

13:53.041 --> 13:54.201
A little birdie
told me about

13:54.459 --> 13:56.836
the Succubitch's
blow-out at the Dal.

13:57.087 --> 13:57.746
What do you want?

13:58.005 --> 13:59.165
Bo.

13:59.923 --> 14:02.005
Strung up
and executed.

14:02.259 --> 14:04.716
The Dark Fae that she
fed on is an eyewitness

14:04.970 --> 14:07.837
to exactly how excessive
her appetite has become.

14:08.098 --> 14:10.054
That Fae's in a coma.

14:10.308 --> 14:12.264
You're observant.

14:16.398 --> 14:18.639
You're also a Valkyrie.

14:18.900 --> 14:22.142
And we both know
what that means.

14:22.404 --> 14:24.144
Wake him up
so he can |D Bo.

14:24.406 --> 14:26.772
He'll be a vegetable
for the rest of his life.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.399
Oh, boo.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.363
Don't grow a
conscience on me now.

14:31.621 --> 14:33.031
| read your rap sheet.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.999
This little errand is
right in your wheelhouse.

14:38.628 --> 14:39.754
You give me
too much credit.

14:40.005 --> 14:41.870
And you don't
give me enough.

14:43.717 --> 14:44.581
I hope you haven't
fallen in love

14:44.843 --> 14:46.708
with the Happy Sunshine Gang
on your exchange program

14:46.970 --> 14:47.755
with the Light.

14:48.013 --> 14:49.128
lam not one of them.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.095
That's right.

14:51.808 --> 14:54.766
Your loyalties
lie with me.

14:56.813 --> 14:57.973
Fine.

14:59.107 --> 15:00.938
I'm on it.

15:01.193 --> 15:02.774
Cheers, darling.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.780
And would it
kill you to smile?

15:06.823 --> 15:09.075
All that attitude will
only give you wrinkles.

15:11.995 --> 15:14.611
I knew you'd save me.
You always do.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.947
What the hell were you
doing down there?

15:17.292 --> 15:19.248
I told you to
stay away from her.

15:19.836 --> 15:22.122
| just wanted to get
her some ice cream.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.581
I thought maybe
if I was nice--

15:25.842 --> 15:27.798
What happened when
we went to the Norn?

15:28.804 --> 15:29.133
What?

15:29.387 --> 15:31.343
The Norn--
What happened?

15:31.598 --> 15:32.804
She conned you.

15:33.058 --> 15:36.550
Like she always does,
but I got your love back.

15:36.812 --> 15:37.722
How?

15:37.979 --> 15:38.729
Dyson .

15:38.980 --> 15:39.765
How?!

15:40.023 --> 15:41.638
With a chainsaw!

15:41.900 --> 15:44.812
I cut down her stupid
tree and I forced her!

15:45.362 --> 15:47.353
And when the Garuda
killed Ciara l was the one

15:47.614 --> 15:49.775
that went back and saved
your stupid wolf ass!

15:50.033 --> 15:52.274
So, why are you
being so mean to me?

15:53.203 --> 15:54.363
I'm sorry...

15:55.038 --> 15:57.154
I'm sorry, Kenz.
| just had to be sure.

16:00.001 --> 16:01.377
It's okay.

16:02.838 --> 16:03.793
It's okay.

16:07.008 --> 16:08.964
I'm just so scared.

16:09.386 --> 16:11.718
I feel like I've lost
my best friend.

16:12.389 --> 16:13.754
You haven't
lost her.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.719
And you still got me. Right?

16:16.977 --> 16:19.343
I don't feel safe.

16:19.604 --> 16:21.515
I don't want
to go home.

16:23.316 --> 16:26.399
Well, you could
stay with me.

16:34.619 --> 16:36.405
How's it going
over there?

16:37.622 --> 16:38.828
From over here, it looks
like those shackles

16:39.082 --> 16:40.743
are made
of reinforced steel.

16:41.001 --> 16:42.866
That's pretty
strong stuff.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.165
And you're looking
weaker by the minute.

16:46.423 --> 16:48.254
Just another reason
not to waste my breath

16:48.508 --> 16:49.884
talking to you.

16:50.135 --> 16:51.545
You don't give up,
do you?

16:51.803 --> 16:53.304
When it comes
to Kenzi, no.

16:54.181 --> 16:55.466
And I never will.

16:57.017 --> 16:59.633
Well, in that case,
you're gonna need some help.

17:01.313 --> 17:03.349
I thought you
wanted me locked up.

17:03.607 --> 17:05.723
Ugh, I do...

17:05.984 --> 17:07.565
But, not like this.

17:08.403 --> 17:09.904
Anyway, you're gonna need
some help finding

17:10.155 --> 17:13.693
your little goth friend.
That thing is not Kenzi.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.990
But we're going
to need some proof.

17:17.412 --> 17:19.778
This better not
be a joke.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.117
No joke.

17:22.626 --> 17:24.662
Open the door.
We have to hurry.

17:33.011 --> 17:33.841
Thank you.

17:34.095 --> 17:36.381
You mess this up,
all bets are off.

17:40.518 --> 17:41.644
So, how do we
get out of here?

17:41.895 --> 17:43.726
Why don't we just
walk out the front door?

17:43.980 --> 17:45.390
What about Dyson?

17:45.815 --> 17:48.101
I think we have
a little window of time.

17:56.034 --> 17:57.069
Good plan.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.365
Guess that
window closed.

17:58.620 --> 17:59.860
What's going on here?

18:00.121 --> 18:02.157
I thought you were taking
Kenzi back to your place.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.495
Change of plans.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.581
Why is Bo out
of her bonds?

18:05.835 --> 18:07.541
She needed
some exercise.

18:11.841 --> 18:12.830
Look.

18:13.093 --> 18:14.924
We both know there's only
one way out of this.

18:15.178 --> 18:16.258
I agree.

18:16.805 --> 18:18.716
And it's back
that way.

18:19.808 --> 18:22.641
I will stop you
if I have to.

18:22.894 --> 18:24.930
If there's one thing I hate,
it's a man getting in the way

18:25.188 --> 18:26.803
of what I want.
It's so... retro.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.556
Dyson,
Kenzi is out there.

18:29.818 --> 18:30.728
You need to help us.

18:30.986 --> 18:33.147
No, you need
to go back, Bo.

18:33.405 --> 18:33.939
I made a promise!

18:34.197 --> 18:35.357
No!

18:35.615 --> 18:37.697
Not until
I find Kenzi.

18:40.954 --> 18:43.036
For the record:

18:43.373 --> 18:45.329
I really didn't want
to have to do this.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.369
What?
Give up peacefully?

18:47.627 --> 18:49.413
Funny.

18:50.005 --> 18:52.747
People never
seem to learn...

18:53.008 --> 18:55.795
Don't mess
with a Valkyrie.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.312
What are you?

19:09.983 --> 19:11.473
What are you
doing to him?

19:11.735 --> 19:12.770
Bo needs help--
She--

19:13.028 --> 19:15.360
She needs
to be restrained.

19:19.409 --> 19:20.524
[Whack]

19:22.037 --> 19:23.117
What was that?

19:23.621 --> 19:26.704
Come on, Shawshank.
We're running out of time.

19:31.588 --> 19:32.748
BO:
I saw her face.

19:33.006 --> 19:34.086
She had these
little teeth.

19:34.341 --> 19:35.751
Like little,
teeny, tiny teeth?

19:36.009 --> 19:37.499
Yes!

19:37.761 --> 19:39.797
Ugh, I think it's
a Kitsune, a Fox Fae.

19:40.055 --> 19:41.761
You know what
that thing is?

19:42.015 --> 19:42.299
Yeah.

19:42.557 --> 19:44.843
We need to find her and force
her to take us to Kenzi.

19:45.101 --> 19:45.726
I might know
a short cut.

19:45.977 --> 19:47.558
I did a job for
friends a while back.

19:47.812 --> 19:49.928
That's not
cryptic at all.

19:51.399 --> 19:53.560
ls Dyson going
to be okay?

19:55.111 --> 19:55.770
What did
you do to him?

19:56.029 --> 19:58.020
Just jammed his
signals a little bit.

19:58.281 --> 19:59.566
A little doubt
goes a long way.

19:59.824 --> 20:01.564
He'll be second-guessing
himself for a while,

20:01.826 --> 20:02.941
but he'll be fine.

20:03.203 --> 20:04.534
Doubt, huh?

20:05.914 --> 20:07.199
It's kinda my thing.

20:08.792 --> 20:09.998
Well,
it was intense.

20:14.381 --> 20:15.996
Glad you enjoyed
the show.

20:19.969 --> 20:21.129
Any news?

20:21.596 --> 20:23.336
Bo's test
results are baffling.

20:23.598 --> 20:25.054
Her blood pressure
is through the roof,

20:25.308 --> 20:28.550
but her glucose levels have
come back completely normal.

20:28.812 --> 20:30.894
But the most
distressing thing...

20:31.147 --> 20:32.557
Her cells are dying

20:32.816 --> 20:33.726
They're being attacked.

20:33.983 --> 20:34.768
A virus.

20:35.026 --> 20:35.776
You would think.

20:36.027 --> 20:37.358
But there's no
sign of infection.

20:37.612 --> 20:40.570
Unless The Morrigan has
found a way to attack Bo.

20:40.824 --> 20:42.109
What's your
margin of error?

20:42.367 --> 20:44.574
I know how to conduct
tests on my patients.

20:44.828 --> 20:46.159
That's not what
I'm implying.

20:46.413 --> 20:47.949
It's just that science
isn't always exact.

20:48.206 --> 20:49.742
Of course
science is exact.

20:49.999 --> 20:52.126
These test results
are just inconclusive.

20:52.377 --> 20:53.537
This isn't a
parasite, Trick.

20:53.795 --> 20:55.251
That's the first
thing that I checked.

20:55.505 --> 20:56.585
Maybe you
missed something.

20:56.840 --> 20:59.422
I know the biochemical
anatomy of my girlfriend!

21:01.177 --> 21:02.917
I didn't miss anything.
I am telling you,

21:03.179 --> 21:04.965
this is something
that is happening in Bo,

21:05.223 --> 21:06.759
not something that
happened to her.

21:07.016 --> 21:09.428
We're both too close,
sometimes our emotions

21:09.686 --> 21:11.142
cloud our judgment.

21:11.396 --> 21:12.932
All I'm saying is

21:13.189 --> 21:16.147
that maybe we're looking
in the wrong place.

21:19.362 --> 21:21.353
Is there something
you're not telling me?

21:21.614 --> 21:22.729
Just--

21:22.991 --> 21:24.356
We need more samples.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.733
Leave nothing to chance.

21:28.121 --> 21:28.780
Okay.

21:29.038 --> 21:30.369
I want to check
on Bo anyway.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.488
I'll come with you.

21:40.216 --> 21:41.376
Bo?

21:44.012 --> 21:46.549
So, I'm taking
another gap year.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.717
Interior Design was
killer last semester.

21:48.975 --> 21:51.762
Even after she
slept with her prof.

21:52.020 --> 21:53.976
Lola, this is
my friend, Bo.

21:54.230 --> 21:57.347
As in, unaligned
Succubus Bo?

21:57.817 --> 21:59.353
I heard she was
in Hecuba prison.

21:59.611 --> 22:01.147
I heard she went Dark.

22:01.404 --> 22:03.144
I heard she was pretty.

22:05.366 --> 22:06.572
This girl's
all pasty.

22:06.826 --> 22:09.943
And to think I felt I missed
out by not going to college.

22:10.205 --> 22:11.035
Okay.

22:11.289 --> 22:12.699
We're looking for
a friend of yours,

22:12.957 --> 22:15.073
she used to live here.
She liked shiny things?

22:16.377 --> 22:18.413
lnari's no friend
to anybody.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.457
This one time,
I woke up from a nap

22:20.715 --> 22:23.752
and Inari was just
staring at me.

22:24.010 --> 22:26.342
One time, she used
my toothbrush.

22:26.596 --> 22:28.336
Like in her mouth.

22:28.598 --> 22:30.338
Not to mention
your boyfriend.

22:30.600 --> 22:31.225
In her mouth.

22:31.476 --> 22:33.262
Hiss!

22:34.062 --> 22:36.553
It got so crazy, we had to
boot her out of Gamma Chi.

22:36.814 --> 22:39.305
She burned down our last den...
the old Sorority House

22:39.567 --> 22:41.774
and that's when we hired
Tamsin for security.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.893
I made her doubt
herself and her friends,

22:44.155 --> 22:46.362
told her The Norn
could grant her a wish.

22:46.616 --> 22:47.731
For a price.

22:47.992 --> 22:50.574
The one thing lnari really
wanted was a friend.

22:50.828 --> 22:52.955
She agreed to make a trade,
but she didn't know

22:53.206 --> 22:54.912
that the Norn would take
her Glamour powers.

22:55.166 --> 22:56.326
Without them,
she couldn't feed.

22:56.584 --> 22:58.700
Not being able to Kitsune
made her go cray-cray.

22:58.962 --> 23:01.123
Does The Norn still have
lnari's powers bottled up?

23:01.381 --> 23:03.713
411 is some human chick
busted into The Norn's

23:03.967 --> 23:05.798
and went all
lumberjack on her tree.

23:06.052 --> 23:08.134
Spilled a bottle of lnari
juice all over herself.

23:08.388 --> 23:10.754
And when lnari found out,
she went on this bender

23:11.015 --> 23:12.971
and stalked the poor thing
to get her powers back.

23:13.226 --> 23:14.716
That's Kenzi.

23:14.978 --> 23:17.060
Why would Kenzi
see the Norn?

23:17.313 --> 23:19.269
Do any of you know
where lnari's at now?

23:19.524 --> 23:20.889
Whenever we
used to fight, she--

23:21.150 --> 23:21.730
Shut up, Kasey!

23:21.985 --> 23:22.724
Yeah, Kasey.

23:22.986 --> 23:24.351
I don't want her
coming after us.

23:24.612 --> 23:27.354
It's cool.
Tam-Tam's our friend.

23:27.615 --> 23:28.320
Well...

23:28.575 --> 23:29.906
Sometimes she crashed
in this creepy cave,

23:30.159 --> 23:31.740
near the old dump
off Hwy 8.

23:31.995 --> 23:34.156
Do not
underestimate her.

23:34.414 --> 23:36.780
I wouldn't want
to be that human.

23:38.793 --> 23:39.908
Dyson .

23:40.962 --> 23:42.827
[Groaning]

23:44.966 --> 23:46.046
Are you okay?

23:47.594 --> 23:48.709
Where are they?
Where'd they go?

23:48.970 --> 23:50.926
What happened?
Where's Bo?

23:52.390 --> 23:53.926
I don't know.
|__

23:54.183 --> 23:56.720
Your pupils
keep dilating.

23:56.978 --> 23:58.718
Dyson, what happened?

23:58.980 --> 24:01.346
Did you want me
to let them go?

24:01.608 --> 24:03.144
You're not
making sense.

24:03.401 --> 24:06.143
Where's Bo?

24:06.404 --> 24:07.644
Tamsin--
It was Tamsin.

24:07.905 --> 24:09.736
Tamsin took her?
Where?

24:09.991 --> 24:10.741
The Morrigan?

24:10.992 --> 24:13.358
No, no, they--
Ugh--

24:13.620 --> 24:15.576
They went to look
for the real Kenzi.

24:15.997 --> 24:17.578
What did she do to me?

24:17.832 --> 24:19.743
Valkyries use their
power of intimidation

24:20.001 --> 24:21.912
to spread
and plant doubt.

24:22.170 --> 24:24.536
It's a potent
tool of war.

24:24.797 --> 24:26.753
Her face...

24:27.800 --> 24:28.789
...changed.

24:29.052 --> 24:32.590
They only reveal their true
selves to their opponents.

24:32.847 --> 24:34.553
It's part of
their deception.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.183
Bo.

24:36.434 --> 24:37.219
Gotta find Bo.

24:37.477 --> 24:38.262
No.

24:38.519 --> 24:39.895
The effects take
time to wear off.

24:40.146 --> 24:41.352
You'll still be
doubting your thoughts

24:41.606 --> 24:43.142
and your feelings
for a while.

24:43.399 --> 24:46.311
Even when you feel like
you're back to your old self,

24:46.569 --> 24:48.560
you still might be
under her spell.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.357
No, l, l,
I gotta find Bo.

24:50.615 --> 24:53.573
Dyson, just go home
and sleep it off.

24:54.202 --> 24:55.988
Okay.

24:58.039 --> 24:59.825
Kenzi!

25:15.807 --> 25:16.762
[Phone ringing]

25:17.016 --> 25:18.131
Dyson .

25:19.811 --> 25:21.142
Hey, boy.

25:21.396 --> 25:22.977
Thanks for the
hangover headache.

25:23.231 --> 25:23.720
Didn't even have
the pleasure

25:23.981 --> 25:25.482
of getting drunk
with you first.

25:25.733 --> 25:26.848
Pleasure was all mine.

25:27.110 --> 25:29.647
I know your game
now, Tamsin.

25:29.904 --> 25:31.690
I'm going to see it
coming next time.

25:31.948 --> 25:32.937
So like a man...

25:33.199 --> 25:36.066
Always begging
for a next time.

25:36.619 --> 25:39.736
I told Trick that you wouldn't
take Bo to The Morrigan.

25:39.997 --> 25:42.158
I gave you my word,
didn't I?

25:43.376 --> 25:45.537
That's not worth much,
I'm afraid.

25:46.796 --> 25:49.128
I'm helping Bo find
the real Kenzi.

25:49.382 --> 25:50.747
Is that a trick, too?

25:51.008 --> 25:51.713
No.

25:51.968 --> 25:53.174
But this is.

25:55.680 --> 25:56.760
Tamsin?

25:57.014 --> 25:58.470
What was that?

25:58.725 --> 26:00.090
Bad reception.

26:00.977 --> 26:03.138
Tamsin?
[Dial tone]

26:03.396 --> 26:04.681
Dammit.

26:06.023 --> 26:06.773
Hi.

26:07.024 --> 26:07.979
You're home.

26:09.986 --> 26:11.476
Yeah, what's
left of me.

26:14.574 --> 26:17.156
I feel like I left my head under
the boulder that crushed it.

26:17.410 --> 26:18.365
Mm...

26:18.995 --> 26:22.783
Poor... poor wolf pup.

26:23.583 --> 26:25.414
It's nothing
a nap won't cure.

26:30.798 --> 26:32.538
How about
you take the bed?

26:32.800 --> 26:33.835
ReaHy?

26:34.594 --> 26:38.212
Cuz I would feel much
safer with you close by.

26:38.806 --> 26:42.264
I'm small, I won't
take up too much room.

26:42.518 --> 26:43.849
Please, Dyson?

26:44.103 --> 26:47.061
Please, just until
I fall asleep?

27:04.582 --> 27:05.662
Thank you.

27:06.918 --> 27:08.874
I feel so much better.

27:12.590 --> 27:15.297
Just try to get
some sleep.

27:22.016 --> 27:24.132
You okay back there?
Need to sit down?

27:24.393 --> 27:25.519
What?

27:25.770 --> 27:27.556
No, I'm good.

27:27.814 --> 27:29.600
We can take a break.

27:30.983 --> 27:32.564
This isn't a break.

27:32.819 --> 27:35.151
This is me relishing
the chance to grill you.

27:35.404 --> 27:37.190
Okay.

27:37.824 --> 27:40.736
So, this is what
you do for fun?

27:40.993 --> 27:42.324
Track people?

27:42.578 --> 27:43.567
Did.

27:43.830 --> 27:45.286
Past life, past tense.

27:45.540 --> 27:48.122
And it wasn't always
this much fun.

27:48.376 --> 27:49.536
Right.

27:49.794 --> 27:52.706
So, how did a bounty hunter
like you end up being a cop?

27:52.964 --> 27:53.999
Here.

27:54.257 --> 27:57.124
Special assignment...
I pissed off the wrong people.

27:57.385 --> 28:00.548
No, really...
I am asking.

28:00.805 --> 28:03.137
But you're not
really listening.

28:03.391 --> 28:04.130
There.

28:04.392 --> 28:06.553
There's that
smell again.

28:06.811 --> 28:08.176
What smell?

28:08.437 --> 28:10.689
When lnari, that thing,
brought me ice cream

28:10.940 --> 28:11.770
I smelled something.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.764
I don't know, like,
clay, I think.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.141
It's getting stronger.

28:15.403 --> 28:16.768
Is that
a Succubus thing?

28:17.029 --> 28:18.360
No.
It is a new thing.

28:19.532 --> 28:20.647
Ugh--

28:22.994 --> 28:24.609
You're not okay.

28:24.871 --> 28:26.156
Don't worry about it.

28:26.414 --> 28:28.655
We need
to keep moving.

28:50.396 --> 28:51.727
What the hell was that?

28:51.981 --> 28:53.721
Come on, Dyson.

28:53.983 --> 28:55.769
We're finally alone.

28:57.987 --> 29:00.979
Don't tell me you've never
thought about this before.

29:03.576 --> 29:05.362
Mmm...

29:05.995 --> 29:07.110
Ahh!

29:09.040 --> 29:10.530
This isn't happening.

29:10.791 --> 29:12.998
We can do
whatever you want.

29:17.590 --> 29:20.548
I can be
your slave, Dyson.

29:20.801 --> 29:22.507
And you
could be mine.

29:23.179 --> 29:24.544
Bo was right...

29:24.805 --> 29:25.339
You are not...

29:25.598 --> 29:26.462

29:26.724 --> 29:27.679
...Kenzi.

29:29.018 --> 29:30.303
[Snarling]

29:34.231 --> 29:37.815

want to love you.

KENZI: lnari?

29:53.000 --> 29:54.581
Hello?

29:57.797 --> 29:59.913
I take back
what I said.

30:00.174 --> 30:02.961
Your ourfit
isn't totally hein--

30:05.972 --> 30:07.712
Where are you?

30:07.974 --> 30:13.560
[Snarling]

30:13.813 --> 30:14.723
Oh, no.

30:14.981 --> 30:16.141

30:16.399 --> 30:17.730

Uh!

30:24.365 --> 30:25.901
[Snarling]

30:26.158 --> 30:27.944
Get out!

30:52.810 --> 30:58.521
May the force...
be... with... me.

31:01.068 --> 31:05.437
[Struggling]

31:11.787 --> 31:14.039
Not exactly
a bobby pin, but...

31:18.794 --> 31:19.954
Sorry, guys...

31:20.463 --> 31:22.795
I ain't dog food.

31:32.475 --> 31:35.057
Can't say I didn't
learn me some skill.

31:39.023 --> 31:39.557
Dyson!

31:39.815 --> 31:41.351
I came as
soon as I could.

31:41.609 --> 31:42.143
I killed her!

31:42.401 --> 31:43.811
I think I killed her!

31:44.070 --> 31:44.559
What happened?

31:44.820 --> 31:45.730
I don't know--

31:45.988 --> 31:48.354
I don't think
this is kenzi, but--

31:48.616 --> 31:50.106
She's not
changing back!

31:50.367 --> 31:52.028
She had this face,
it wasn't Kenzi--

31:52.995 --> 31:54.110
Please tell me
this isn't her!

31:54.371 --> 31:55.952
Lay her flat.

32:02.713 --> 32:03.873
Why isn't she
changing back?!

32:04.131 --> 32:04.665
Dyson--

32:04.924 --> 32:07.040
I need you
to calm down.

32:19.188 --> 32:21.019
It's Fae.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.769
She's Fae?

32:28.364 --> 32:30.104
Bo was telling the truth.

32:30.366 --> 32:32.857
But she smells
like Kenzi.

32:34.954 --> 32:36.819
Some Fae have strong
powers of deception.

32:37.081 --> 32:40.323
She could have used
Kenzi's scent to--

32:41.168 --> 32:42.749
Thank you.

32:43.963 --> 32:45.373
Thank you, Lauren.

32:46.006 --> 32:47.166
It's okay.

32:48.968 --> 32:50.128
Bo was right.

32:50.386 --> 32:52.047
And we didn't
believe her.

32:53.180 --> 32:55.717
But if this is
an impostor--

32:55.975 --> 32:56.714
Kenzi's missing.

32:56.976 --> 32:59.092
And so is Bo.

33:01.021 --> 33:02.761
I can track them
by their scent.

33:07.027 --> 33:09.234
Jeez, you sound like you
smoke eight packs a day.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.524
Take a knee, soldier.

33:11.782 --> 33:14.398
No. l have
to keep going.

33:14.785 --> 33:15.774
Find Kenzi.

33:20.958 --> 33:22.243
This is all my fault.

33:22.501 --> 33:24.708
I am a terrible friend.

33:24.962 --> 33:26.998
Are you kidding me?

33:27.256 --> 33:28.336
My "friends" wouldn't
even walk two blocks

33:28.591 --> 33:30.331
if I was stuck
in a bear trap.

33:30.593 --> 33:33.300
Then you need
new ones.

33:34.180 --> 33:36.887
What's so great
about Kenzi, anyway?

33:40.186 --> 33:41.642
She's, uh...

33:44.398 --> 33:45.683
She's Kenzi.

33:48.194 --> 33:49.525
She's smart

33:49.778 --> 33:51.985
and honest

33:52.239 --> 33:54.104
and kind.

33:55.993 --> 33:58.109
And she makes
me feel normal.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.622
And special...

34:00.873 --> 34:04.115
...all at the same time.

34:04.376 --> 34:05.536
Oh.

34:05.794 --> 34:08.786
She is my heart,
Tamsin.

34:09.048 --> 34:11.414
I don't even know how
long she's been missing.

34:11.675 --> 34:13.131
She kept trying to
tell me something,

34:13.385 --> 34:15.762
and I wouldn't even
listen to her.

34:21.268 --> 34:26.433
Promise me that if
something happens...

34:28.609 --> 34:32.272
Promise me that
you will find her.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.695
Okay, why don't we save
this guilt trip for later.

34:35.950 --> 34:38.862
We're hunting Kitsune.
Get in the game!

34:42.790 --> 34:44.701
When was the
last time you fed?

34:44.959 --> 34:47.746
I don't know.
I can't remember.

34:50.381 --> 34:53.043
You need a
snack, so...

34:53.300 --> 34:56.087
You can feed
off of me.

34:57.388 --> 34:58.924
I kinda hate you.

34:59.390 --> 35:00.755
I don't exactly
love it either.

35:01.016 --> 35:02.847
But, I need you cranked
to eleven, okay?

35:03.102 --> 35:04.717
lnari is a ballsy bitch

35:04.979 --> 35:06.560
and shit will
definitely get real.

35:06.814 --> 35:08.850
So, feed off of me!

35:09.817 --> 35:11.728
You tell
anyone about this

35:11.986 --> 35:13.146
and I will kill you.

35:13.404 --> 35:15.065
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

35:23.580 --> 35:25.912
I said feed off of me,
not suck me dry!

35:26.166 --> 35:28.828
Wow!
That was amazing.

35:29.378 --> 35:31.994
I've never tasted
Chi like that.

35:32.256 --> 35:32.540
That's not
the first time

35:32.798 --> 35:33.833
someone's said
that about me.

35:34.091 --> 35:35.547
It was incredible...

35:35.801 --> 35:38.167
But, different.

35:38.971 --> 35:40.336
[Clears throat]

35:40.973 --> 35:41.723
Well...

35:41.974 --> 35:44.556
Glad you're
sufficiently juiced.

35:50.149 --> 35:51.229
We got company.

35:51.483 --> 35:53.519
Looks like they're guarding
something in that cave.

35:53.777 --> 35:55.153
Kenzi...

35:55.404 --> 35:57.190
Let's do this.

35:58.949 --> 36:00.689
Finally.

36:00.951 --> 36:02.111
Did you redo
the samples?

36:02.369 --> 36:03.905
I did exactly
as you asked

36:04.163 --> 36:06.119
and the data
came back the same.

36:06.373 --> 36:07.829
Her cells are being
destroyed and then--

36:08.083 --> 36:08.663
Then what?

36:08.917 --> 36:09.906
Replaced.

36:10.169 --> 36:11.534
They're being replaced.

36:11.795 --> 36:13.126
You must have
done something wrong.

36:13.380 --> 36:15.757
Trick--!

36:16.008 --> 36:18.715
The results are accurate.
I know what I'm doing.

36:18.969 --> 36:20.709
Now what are you
not telling me?

36:20.971 --> 36:23.553
It's impossible...

36:23.807 --> 36:25.718
It's too soon.

36:25.976 --> 36:26.806
Unless something
triggered it.

36:27.061 --> 36:29.302
What?
What's too soon?

36:29.563 --> 36:31.394
We have to prepare
for Bo's return.

36:31.648 --> 36:33.104
If Dyson can find her--

36:33.359 --> 36:34.474
When.

36:35.778 --> 36:37.894
When Dyson finds her.

36:38.155 --> 36:39.691
When.

36:39.948 --> 36:41.688
I need to prepare
an herbal tonic.

36:41.950 --> 36:44.862
Will you help me?

36:45.120 --> 36:46.951
Come on...

36:47.206 --> 36:48.537
Come on!

36:48.791 --> 36:50.907
[Chains rattling]

36:51.168 --> 36:51.702
Oh my geez!

36:51.960 --> 36:53.086
Rawr!

36:53.879 --> 36:58.339
[Snarling]

36:58.592 --> 36:59.752
Ahh!

37:04.473 --> 37:06.259
Bo!

37:07.810 --> 37:09.095
Ugh--
[Crying]

37:09.353 --> 37:11.093
I knew you'd come.

37:11.355 --> 37:14.722
Oh. You're okay.

37:14.983 --> 37:16.359
You're okay.

37:16.610 --> 37:17.770
No--

37:18.028 --> 37:19.893
No, I'm not.

37:20.155 --> 37:22.942
I just--
I just want a burger.

37:23.951 --> 37:25.657
And fries...
And a second burger.

37:25.911 --> 37:28.118
Anything that
you want.

37:28.372 --> 37:32.115
[Snarling]

37:32.376 --> 37:33.536
Uh!

37:34.586 --> 37:35.746
Dyson .

37:39.174 --> 37:40.334
There you are.

37:41.385 --> 37:43.842
I'm so sorry.
I should've known.

37:44.096 --> 37:46.428
There's a lot of
blame to go around.

37:46.682 --> 37:48.764
Help me get her out
of this horrible place.

37:49.017 --> 37:50.882
I got her.
Go help Tamsin.

37:51.395 --> 37:53.351
[Snarling]

38:01.572 --> 38:02.061
Wow.

38:02.322 --> 38:03.607
Yeah.

38:04.992 --> 38:07.199
I guess
I owe you one.

38:07.786 --> 38:10.493
I'd say we're
more than even.

38:16.587 --> 38:18.373
Kenzi.

38:58.795 --> 39:00.171
She's finally asleep.

39:00.422 --> 39:01.878
I've never seen
her eat so much

39:02.132 --> 39:03.542
and that's
saying something.

39:04.801 --> 39:06.177
Bo...

39:11.266 --> 39:11.721
I really screwed up.

39:11.975 --> 39:13.090
I can't right now.

39:16.772 --> 39:18.012
It's okay.

39:20.275 --> 39:21.856
I'm just glad
she's safe.

39:25.364 --> 39:27.480
I see the sedative
has kicked in.

39:30.994 --> 39:33.076
How are you feeling
after your milkshake?

39:33.330 --> 39:34.194
Well, I had to drink
another milkshake

39:34.456 --> 39:36.412
to wash the taste
out of my mouth.

39:37.251 --> 39:38.366
What was in that thing?

39:38.627 --> 39:39.912
Tastes awful,
but it works.

39:40.170 --> 39:42.126
Bo's fever is down,
and her vitals

39:42.381 --> 39:45.919
are back to normal, so...
I'd say she's stable.

39:46.176 --> 39:47.507
That's good.

39:47.761 --> 39:50.503
But the concoction is
only a stop-gap measure.

39:50.764 --> 39:53.130
We'll have to monitor you
carefully from now on.

39:53.392 --> 39:55.474
Trick, what is
happening to me?

39:58.313 --> 39:59.564
The Dawning.

39:59.940 --> 40:03.774
An ancient Fae evolution.
A moment of choice.

40:04.027 --> 40:06.109
It's just happening
two hundred years too soon.

40:06.363 --> 40:08.228
LAUREN:
The Dawning?

40:08.490 --> 40:09.946
I've only heard
whispers of it.

40:10.200 --> 40:11.701
So little is
written about it.

40:11.952 --> 40:13.692
It's not meant for your
kind to understand.

40:13.954 --> 40:15.865
Well, it is if you
need my help.

40:16.123 --> 40:17.613
No, of course--

40:17.874 --> 40:19.034
What now?

40:19.793 --> 40:21.454
Will you two both
come with me?

40:26.800 --> 40:29.041
I'll stay with her.

40:47.988 --> 40:49.103
Where am I?

40:49.781 --> 40:50.896
You're in a hospital.

40:51.575 --> 40:53.531
You were in a coma.

40:54.870 --> 40:56.826
I need to ask you
a few questions.

40:59.082 --> 41:00.492
What happened?

41:00.959 --> 41:02.335
You were assaulted
outside the Dal.

41:02.586 --> 41:04.201
Do you remember?

41:06.590 --> 41:07.955
Yeah.

41:12.971 --> 41:15.303
Was this
who attacked you?

41:15.557 --> 41:16.922
Ugh!

41:19.936 --> 41:21.597
Why does it
hurt so much?

41:24.775 --> 41:26.936
Make it stop--

41:27.986 --> 41:30.898
Is this
who attacked you?

41:31.156 --> 41:33.522
Yeah, that's her--

41:35.285 --> 41:37.071
Please.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.328
Make it stop--

41:40.582 --> 41:41.992
[Monitor beeping]

41:42.250 --> 41:43.660
Ugh--

41:44.169 --> 41:48.128
[Wincing]

41:48.382 --> 41:49.542
Ugh!

41:50.175 --> 41:52.086
[Flatline]

41:52.344 --> 41:54.084
PA: Code Blue, lCU.

41:54.346 --> 41:55.677
Is he awake?

41:55.931 --> 41:57.842
He was.

41:58.350 --> 41:59.430
What happened?

41:59.685 --> 42:01.892
He didn't talk.
He's dead.

42:03.563 --> 42:04.973
Take a minute.

42:05.315 --> 42:08.273
Think this through
before you commit.

42:09.569 --> 42:12.561
You sure this is how
you want to play it?

42:15.075 --> 42:17.031
Bold move.

42:17.577 --> 42:18.953
See you around.

42:19.579 --> 42:20.739
Bet on it.

42:22.958 --> 42:24.698
The Dawning is
a Rite of Passage

42:24.960 --> 42:27.121
that every Fae
must undergo.

42:28.004 --> 42:31.496
It's a grueling process that
takes years to prepare for,

42:31.758 --> 42:34.716
but with the right
training, they pass.

42:34.970 --> 42:36.085
Does everyone pass?

42:36.346 --> 42:38.302
Unfortunately, no.

42:38.765 --> 42:40.380
Well--

42:41.351 --> 42:42.887
What happens
if they fail?

42:43.145 --> 42:45.306
If they fail,
they devolve.

42:45.564 --> 42:47.100
That's why you could
smell the clay

42:47.357 --> 42:48.597
from the Kitsune's cave.

42:48.859 --> 42:53.068
An acute sense of smell is
the first sign of de-evolution.

43:12.799 --> 43:13.754
Rawr!

43:15.927 --> 43:17.133
What is that?

43:18.138 --> 43:19.674
It's some kind
of UnderFae.

43:19.931 --> 43:21.387
It was also a Satyr.

43:21.641 --> 43:24.633
Before it failed
its right of passage.

43:28.148 --> 43:30.184
Is that gonna
happen to me?

43:30.442 --> 43:33.309
We have a lot
of work to do.
