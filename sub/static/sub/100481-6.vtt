>> John: HI THERE.

00:01.468 --> 00:02.503
LOOK, BEFORE WE START TONIGHT,

00:02.569 --> 00:03.455
I WANTED TO SAY A COUPLE OF

00:03.455 --> 00:04.923
THINGS.

00:04.990 --> 00:05.696
AS YOU CAN SEE, WE'RE STILL NOT

00:05.696 --> 00:06.897
BACK IN OUR STUDIO.

00:06.964 --> 00:08.399
WE'RE NOT EVEN WHERE WE SHOT THE

00:08.466 --> 00:09.433
LAST SHOW.

00:09.500 --> 00:10.801
WE'VE ALL BEEN WORKING FROM HOME

00:10.868 --> 00:12.937
THIS WEEK, INCLUDING ME, SO I'M

00:13.004 --> 00:17.341
SHOOTING THIS AT HOME, ALONE,

00:17.408 --> 00:18.743
WITH NO ONE ELSE IN THE ROOM.

00:18.809 --> 00:19.744
SO YOU WON'T HEAR ANY LAUGHTER

00:19.810 --> 00:20.344
TONIGHT.

00:20.411 --> 00:21.712
PLEASE DON'T FEEL THAT'S AT ALL

00:21.779 --> 00:22.313
AWKWARD ‐‐ IT CERTAINLY ISN'T

00:22.380 --> 00:24.448
FOR ME.

00:24.515 --> 00:29.453
I STARTED COMEDY DOING STAND‐UP

00:29.520 --> 00:30.288
IN ENGLAND, SO I AM MORE THAN

00:30.354 --> 00:30.921
USED TO DOING JOKES TO SILENCE.

00:30.988 --> 00:31.956
IT'S ACTUALLY HOW I'M MOST

00:32.023 --> 00:32.690
COMFORTABLE.

00:32.757 --> 00:35.326
ALSO, WE HAD TO SHOOT THIS ON

00:35.393 --> 00:36.794
SATURDAY, BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT

00:36.861 --> 00:37.662
EVERYTHING TAKES LONGER TO PUT

00:37.728 --> 00:38.596
TOGETHER WHEN NOBODY IS ALLOWED

00:38.663 --> 00:39.830
NEAR EACH OTHER.

00:39.897 --> 00:40.931
I WANT TO THANK OUR STAFF FOR

00:40.998 --> 00:41.766
WORKING SO HARD TO MAKE THIS

00:41.832 --> 00:42.700
POSSIBLE.

00:42.767 --> 00:44.402
I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR

00:44.468 --> 00:47.271
WATCHING AND FOR BEING PATIENT

00:47.338 --> 00:48.973
WHILE WE TRY AND PUT THE BEST

00:49.040 --> 00:49.807
SHOW WE CAN TOGETHER FOR YOU.

00:49.874 --> 00:50.541
AND I'D LIKE TO TELL CORONAVIRUS

00:50.608 --> 00:52.143
TO GO FUCK ITSELF.

00:52.209 --> 00:52.910
WHO AM I KIDDING?

00:52.977 --> 00:53.778
CORONAVIRUS DOESN'T WATCH THIS

00:53.844 --> 00:54.979
SHOW.

00:55.046 --> 00:57.281
IT'S MORE OF A BILL MAHER FAN.

04:04.301 --> 04:06.303
UNITED STATES, THE VIRUS

04:06.370 --> 04:07.538
CONTINUES TO SPREAD RAPIDLY ‐‐

04:07.605 --> 04:09.306
WE NOW HAVE MORE CONFIRMED

04:09.373 --> 04:10.574
CORONAVIRUS CASES THAN ANY

04:17.081 --> 04:18.015

04:18.082 --> 04:20.284
GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION.

04:20.351 --> 04:22.386
AS RECENTLY AS A MONTH AGO, HE

04:22.453 --> 04:24.154
WAS SAYING WE HAVE IT "VERY MUCH

UNDER CONTROL," ADDING,

04:25.356 --> 04:27.625
"STOCK MARKET STARTING TO LOOK

04:27.691 --> 04:29.360
VERY GOOD TO ME!" BEFORE

04:29.426 --> 04:30.895
ABRUPTLY SHIFTING GEARS TO CLAIM

04:30.961 --> 04:33.197
THAT HE FELT IT WAS A PANDEMIC

04:33.264 --> 04:34.365
LONG BEFORE IT WAS CALLED ONE,

04:34.431 --> 04:36.333
AND THEN, JUST LAST WEEK, MAKING

04:36.400 --> 04:38.035
THIS GRAND DECLARATION.

04:38.102 --> 04:39.737
>> I'M A WARTIME PRESIDENT.

04:39.803 --> 04:40.671
THIS IS A WAR.

04:40.738 --> 04:41.839
THIS IS A WAR.

04:41.906 --> 04:42.873
A DIFFERENT KIND OF WAR THAN

04:42.940 --> 04:44.208
WE'VE EVER HAD.

04:44.275 --> 04:45.743
>> John: YEAH, I GUESS IT IS

04:45.809 --> 04:47.545
DIFFERENT.

04:47.611 --> 04:48.112
ISN'T IT?

04:48.178 --> 04:50.047
IT'S LIKE WORLD WAR II, ONLY THE

04:50.114 --> 04:53.083
ENEMY IS INVISIBLE, OR LIKE

04:53.150 --> 04:55.119
THE VIETNAM WAR, ONLY THIS TIME,

04:55.185 --> 04:56.220
TRUMP IS ACTUALLY TAKING PART.

04:56.287 --> 04:57.321
AND YET, INCREDIBLY, AFTER

04:57.388 --> 04:58.822
BRIEFLY EMBRACING THE NEED FOR

04:58.889 --> 05:00.190
EVERYONE TO ENGAGE IN

"WARTIME PRESIDENT" SEEMED TO

05:08.365 --> 05:11.035

05:15.506 --> 05:17.074
EASTER.

05:17.141 --> 05:18.809
OKAY?

05:18.876 --> 05:19.777
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE IT OPEN BY

05:19.843 --> 05:20.311
EASTER.

05:20.377 --> 05:21.745
I WILL ‐‐ I WILL TELL YOU THAT

05:21.812 --> 05:23.147
RIGHT NOW.

05:23.213 --> 05:24.515
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THAT, IT'S

05:24.582 --> 05:26.283
SUCH AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR OTHER

05:26.350 --> 05:27.551
REASONS, BUT I'LL MAKE IT

05:27.618 --> 05:30.688
AN DIMPORTANT DAY FOR THIS TOO.

05:30.754 --> 05:31.855
>> John: SETTING ASIDE THE

05:31.922 --> 05:32.890
"EASTER'S AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR

05:32.957 --> 05:34.758
OTHER REASONS" ‐‐ THE DATE HE'S

05:34.825 --> 05:36.060
SETTING IS JUST TWO WEEKS FROM

05:36.126 --> 05:37.628
NOW, WHICH IS OBJECTIVELY WAY

05:37.695 --> 05:42.132
TOO SOON.

05:42.199 --> 05:42.933
ALTHOUGH IF YOU'RE GOING TO PICK

05:43.000 --> 05:44.101
A HOLIDAY TO BREAK QUARANTINE,

05:44.168 --> 05:45.069
YOU COULD DO A LOT WORSE THAN

05:45.135 --> 05:46.003
ONE HONORING THE TIME THAT JESUS

05:46.070 --> 05:47.071
WAS SUPPOSED TO STAY INSIDE AND

05:47.137 --> 05:48.505
DIDN'T.

05:48.572 --> 05:49.940
AND IT'S WORTH TAKING A MOMENT

05:50.007 --> 05:51.408
TO APPRECIATE JUST HOW

05:51.475 --> 05:55.179
IRRESPONSIBLE THAT ATTITUDE IS,

05:55.245 --> 05:57.014
BECAUSE WE WASTED SO MUCH TIME

05:57.081 --> 05:57.681
THAT WE COULD'VE SPENT

05:57.748 --> 05:58.682
PREPARING, THE VIRUS IS NOW

05:58.749 --> 06:00.351
WIDESPREAD.

06:00.417 --> 06:02.086
AND THANKS TO HOW WE'VE

06:02.152 --> 06:03.754
MASSIVELY BOTCHED THE ROLLOUT OF

06:03.821 --> 06:05.189
TESTING FOR THE VIRUS, WE STILL

06:05.255 --> 06:06.490
DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW BAD

06:06.557 --> 06:08.292
THINGS ARE.

06:08.359 --> 06:09.560
SO STRICT SOCIAL DISTANCING

06:09.627 --> 06:11.462
MEASURES ARE OUR BEST SHOT AT

06:11.528 --> 06:13.364
SLOWING THIS OUTBREAK.

06:13.430 --> 06:16.266
EPIDEMIOLOGISTS HAVE SAID IF IT

06:16.333 --> 06:17.768
WERE POSSIBLE TO WAVE A

06:17.835 --> 06:20.237
MAGIC WAND AND MAKE ALL

06:20.304 --> 06:21.605
AMERICANS FREEZE IN PLACE FOR

06:21.672 --> 06:24.908
14 DAYS WHILE SITTING SIX FEET

06:24.975 --> 06:26.744
APART, THE WHOLE EPIDEMIC WOULD

06:26.810 --> 06:28.612
SPUTTER TO A HALT.

06:28.679 --> 06:29.380
NOW OBVIOUSLY, THAT MAGIC WAND

06:29.446 --> 06:30.180
IS IMPOSSIBLE.

06:30.247 --> 06:31.315
BUT SOME PEOPLE AREN'T EVEN

06:31.382 --> 06:33.417
DOING ANYTHING CLOSE TO THAT.

06:33.484 --> 06:35.252
AND IF YOU NEED PROOF OF JUST

06:35.319 --> 06:37.087
HOW TRUE THAT IS, JUST LISTEN TO

06:37.154 --> 06:38.756
THE UNDERSTANDABLY EXASPERATED

06:38.822 --> 06:40.591
GOVERNOR OF KENTUCKY.

06:40.658 --> 06:42.326
>> WE HAVE A POSITIVE CASE TODAY

06:42.393 --> 06:43.794
FROM SOMEONE WHO ATTENDED A

06:43.861 --> 06:48.932
CORONAVIRUS PARTY.

06:48.999 --> 06:51.669
AND THIS IS THE PART WHERE I,

06:51.735 --> 06:53.337
THE PERSON THAT TELLS EVERYONE

06:53.404 --> 06:54.271
TO BE CALM, HAVE TO REMAIN CALM

06:54.338 --> 06:56.006
MYSELF.

06:56.073 --> 06:57.474
>> John: WELL, GOOD LUCK WITH

06:57.541 --> 06:58.876
THAT, BECAUSE YOU JUST USED THE

06:58.942 --> 07:01.311
PHRASE "CORONAVIRUS PARTY."

07:01.378 --> 07:03.781
AND HIS DISGUST AT THAT

07:03.847 --> 07:05.916
INFURIATING TERM WAS PERFECTLY

07:05.983 --> 07:07.351
EXPRESSED BY HIS SIGN LANGUAGE

07:07.418 --> 07:09.620
INTERPRETER WHO REALLY GOT

07:09.687 --> 07:11.955
ACROSS THE WHOLE "WHAT THE FUCK

07:12.022 --> 07:12.856
IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?"

07:12.923 --> 07:14.024
SENTIMENT.

07:14.091 --> 07:15.793
TRULY, THAT GESTURE SPEAKS FOR

07:15.859 --> 07:18.495
AMERICA RIGHT NOW.

07:18.562 --> 07:22.533
GIF THAT WOMAN IMMEDIATELY.

07:22.599 --> 07:24.935
SO WE ABSOLUTELY SHOULD NOT BE

07:25.002 --> 07:27.838
RELAXING MEASURES YET ‐‐ AND

07:27.905 --> 07:29.273
TRUMP ACTUALLY CAN'T

07:29.339 --> 07:30.507
FORCE STATES TO DO THAT.

07:30.574 --> 07:31.775
IT'S UP TO GOVERNORS, SOME OF

07:31.842 --> 07:33.043
WHOM, FROM BOTH PARTIES, ARE

07:33.110 --> 07:34.812
TAKING THIS VERY SERIOUSLY.

07:34.878 --> 07:36.747
UNFORTUNATELY, OTHER GOVERNORS

07:36.814 --> 07:38.716
ARE NOT.

07:38.782 --> 07:41.151
RON DeSANTIS IN FLORIDA IS

07:41.218 --> 07:42.286
STILL RESISTING ISSUING A

07:42.352 --> 07:44.488
STATEWIDE STAY‐AT‐HOME ORDER.

07:44.555 --> 07:45.589
AND IN TEXAS, LIEUTENANT

07:45.656 --> 07:47.157
GOVERNOR DAN PATRICK TOOK THINGS

07:47.224 --> 07:48.826
EVEN FURTHER, AGREEING WITH THE

07:48.892 --> 07:50.461
PRESIDENT THAT THE ECONOMIC

07:50.527 --> 07:52.696
DAMAGE OF A LOCKDOWN IS JUST TOO

07:52.763 --> 07:54.131
GREAT TO BEAR.

07:54.198 --> 07:55.699
>> I AM NOT LIVING IN FEAR OF

07:55.766 --> 07:57.801
COVID‐19.

07:57.868 --> 07:58.969
WHAT I'M LIVING IN FEAR OF IS

07:59.036 --> 07:59.837
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THIS

07:59.903 --> 08:00.904
COUNTRY.

08:00.971 --> 08:02.706
AND YOU KNOW, TUCKER, NO ONE

08:02.773 --> 08:04.775
REACHED OUT TO ME AND SAID,

08:04.842 --> 08:06.343
"AS A SENIOR CITIZEN, ARE YOU

08:06.410 --> 08:07.711
WILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE ON YOUR

08:07.778 --> 08:11.248
SURVIVAL IN EXCHANGE FOR KEEPING

08:11.315 --> 08:13.684
THE AMERICA THAT ALL AMERICA

08:13.751 --> 08:15.552
LOVES FOR YOUR CHILDREN AND

08:15.619 --> 08:16.687
GRANDCHILDREN?"

08:16.754 --> 08:18.388
AND IF THAT'S THE EXCHANGE, I'M

08:18.455 --> 08:20.090
ALL IN.

08:20.157 --> 08:20.991
>> John: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING

08:21.058 --> 08:23.594
ABOUT?

08:23.660 --> 08:25.696
FIRST, IF YOU REALLY WANT TO DIE

08:25.763 --> 08:27.331
SO THE U. S. ECONOMY CAN BOOM, WE

08:27.397 --> 08:28.532
ALREADY HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE

08:28.599 --> 08:29.466
FOR THAT, AND IT'S CALLED

08:29.533 --> 08:31.502
BLACK FRIDAY.

08:31.568 --> 08:32.903
HAVE AT IT.

08:32.970 --> 08:34.605
SECOND, WE KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED

08:34.671 --> 08:36.039
IN OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE IRAN AND

08:36.106 --> 08:37.474
SPAIN THAT DIDN'T TAKE SOCIAL

08:37.541 --> 08:39.576
DISTANCING SERIOUSLY.

08:39.643 --> 08:41.345
THEY'RE NOW HOME TO MASS GRAVES

08:41.411 --> 08:42.980
YOU CAN SEE FROM SPACE AND

08:43.046 --> 08:44.715
ICE SKATING RINKS BEING USED AS

08:44.782 --> 08:53.423
MAKESHIFT MORGUES.

08:53.490 --> 08:56.693
>AND I'M IN NO WAY MINIMIZING TE

08:56.760 --> 08:59.563
ECONOMIC SUFFERING CAUSED BY THE

08:59.630 --> 08:59.997
SHUTDOWN.

09:00.063 --> 09:00.764
AND WE SHOULD DO

09:00.831 --> 09:01.431
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MITIGATE

09:01.498 --> 09:02.266
IT.

09:02.332 --> 09:03.066
THIS WEEK'S STIMULUS BILL IS

09:03.133 --> 09:03.801
PROBABLY ONLY THE START OF

09:03.867 --> 09:07.671
WHAT'S NEEDED FOR WORKERS.

09:07.738 --> 09:09.640
BUT THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE SHOULD

09:09.706 --> 09:10.941
SACRIFICE THEMSELVES FOR THE

09:11.008 --> 09:12.609
ECONOMY IS ABSURD, AND YET IT

09:12.676 --> 09:15.045
ACTUALLY GAINED TRACTION THIS

09:15.112 --> 09:18.081
WEEK, COSIGNED BY A VARIETY OF

09:18.148 --> 09:20.117
CONSERVATIVE PUNDITS, NONE MORE

09:20.184 --> 09:22.152
ENTHUSIASTICALLY THAN THIS GUY.

09:22.219 --> 09:26.190
>> I CONTEND THERE ARE MILLIONS

09:26.256 --> 09:26.957
OF AMERICANS JUST LIKE ME THAT

09:27.024 --> 09:27.891
WILL LOOK AT THEIR CHILDREN AND

09:27.958 --> 09:28.492
THEIR GRANDCHILDREN'S FUTURE,

09:28.559 --> 09:29.827
AND THEY'LL SAY "I AM NOT GOING

09:29.893 --> 09:31.395
TO HAVE THEM A SLAVE TO DEBT.

09:31.461 --> 09:33.397
I AM NOT GOING TO ERASE THEIR

09:33.463 --> 09:35.566
FUTURE BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID TO

09:35.632 --> 09:37.534
DIE.

09:37.601 --> 09:41.939
I'M NOT AFRAID TO DIE.

09:42.005 --> 09:43.373
I AM AFRAID THAT OUR NATION

09:43.440 --> 09:45.075
MIGHT DIE, AND THAT DOOMS

09:45.142 --> 09:47.044
MILLIONS TO POVERTY, ILLNESS,

09:47.110 --> 09:53.517
STARVATION, AND A LACK OF HOPE.

09:53.584 --> 09:56.887
LET'S SEE IF THAT WILL TREND."

09:56.954 --> 09:58.522
>> John: YEAH, LET'S SEE IF THAT

09:58.589 --> 10:01.425
WILL TREND, YOU THIRSTY BITCH.

10:01.491 --> 10:03.126
BUT YOU GET THAT THE CORONAVIRUS

10:03.193 --> 10:05.529
IS NOT THE HUNGER GAMES, RIGHT?

10:05.596 --> 10:06.930
YOU CAN'T VOLUNTEER YOURSELF AS

10:06.997 --> 10:09.366
TRIBUTE.

10:09.433 --> 10:10.601
AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS

10:10.667 --> 10:12.536
ACTUALLY MUCH DARKER ‐‐ YOU'RE

10:12.603 --> 10:14.605
ACTIVELY VOLUNTEERING OTHERS,

10:14.671 --> 10:15.839
INCLUDING PEOPLE OF ALL AGES

10:15.906 --> 10:18.842
WITH HEALTH CONDITIONS, LIKE

10:18.909 --> 10:20.878
TO DIE.

10:20.944 --> 10:21.879
AND EVEN IF THESE GUYS ARE OKAY

10:21.945 --> 10:22.846
WITH LETTING THE CORONAVIRUS

10:22.913 --> 10:24.982
KILL AS MANY PEOPLE AS IT

10:25.048 --> 10:25.849
FEELS LIKE SO THAT THE

10:25.916 --> 10:26.884
ECONOMY'S PROTECTED ‐‐

10:26.950 --> 10:29.086
WHICH, AGAIN, REALLY? ‐‐

10:29.152 --> 10:30.554
THERE ARE ‐‐ AND I CANNOT

10:30.621 --> 10:32.222
BELIEVE I HAVE TO SAY THIS ‐‐

10:32.289 --> 10:34.258
SIGNIFICANT DRAWBACKS TO

10:34.324 --> 10:35.192
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

10:35.259 --> 10:37.361
DYING.

10:37.427 --> 10:38.662
HOSPITALS WOULD BE COMPLETELY

10:38.729 --> 10:39.930
OVERWHELMED, WHICH MEANS PEOPLE

10:39.997 --> 10:41.932
SUFFERING FROM THINGS THAT

10:41.999 --> 10:43.600
AREN'T THE CORONAVIRUS ALSO

10:43.667 --> 10:45.702
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET THE

10:45.769 --> 10:47.704
TREATMENT THEY NEED, LEADING TO

10:47.771 --> 10:48.972
EVEN MORE PEOPLE DYING, WHICH ‐‐

10:49.039 --> 10:52.209
TO PUT THIS IN THE ONLY TERMS

10:52.276 --> 10:53.310
THEY SEEM TO CARE ABOUT ‐‐

10:53.377 --> 10:54.311
ALSO TANKS THE ECONOMY.

10:54.378 --> 10:55.579
SO RELAXING SOCIAL DISTANCING

10:55.646 --> 10:57.447
RIGHT NOW ISN'T JUST TRADING ONE

10:57.514 --> 10:59.182
BAD OUTCOME FOR ANOTHER, IT'S

10:59.249 --> 11:01.451
TRADING ONE BAD OUTCOME FOR BOTH

11:01.518 --> 11:04.421
BAD OUTCOMES.

11:04.488 --> 11:05.656
IT'S SHITTING ON YOUR CAKE AND

11:05.722 --> 11:07.958
CHOKING ON IT TOO.

11:08.025 --> 11:09.626
LOOK, IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

11:09.693 --> 11:11.662
FOR AMERICA TO BE GETTING A

11:11.728 --> 11:13.163
CLEAR, CONSISTENT MESSAGE ABOUT

11:13.230 --> 11:15.299
THE SEVERITY OF THE THREAT WE

11:15.365 --> 11:17.467
ARE CURRENTLY FACING.

11:17.534 --> 11:19.202
THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE WILL BE

11:19.269 --> 11:20.804
ABLE TO MANAGE THIS VIRUS,

11:20.871 --> 11:22.706
CONTAIN CASUALTIES, AND GET BACK

11:22.773 --> 11:24.007
TO SOMETHING RESEMBLING

11:24.074 --> 11:26.610
NORMALCY.

11:26.677 --> 11:28.679
AND FLOATING AN EASTER END DATE

11:28.745 --> 11:30.147
ISN'T THE ONLY TROUBLING

11:30.213 --> 11:31.982
DECISION THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE.

11:32.049 --> 11:33.984
RIGHT NOW, ONE OF THE MAJOR

11:34.051 --> 11:35.419
CHALLENGES FACING HOSPITALS

11:35.485 --> 11:37.087
ACROSS THE COUNTRY IS A CRITICAL

11:37.154 --> 11:39.089
SHORTAGE OF EVEN BASIC PERSONAL

11:39.156 --> 11:41.291
PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT LIKE MASKS,

11:41.358 --> 11:43.827
RESPIRATORS, GLOVES, AND FACE

11:43.894 --> 11:45.395
SHIELDS, BECAUSE THEY ARE

11:45.462 --> 11:46.897
RUNNING SHORT TO AN ALARMING

11:46.964 --> 11:48.432
EXTENT.

11:48.498 --> 11:50.033
>> THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT

11:50.100 --> 11:52.069
LITERALLY ARE WEARING BANDANAS

11:52.135 --> 11:53.737
BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOTHING BETTER

11:53.804 --> 11:55.238
THAN THAT TO PROTECT THEMSELVES.

11:55.305 --> 11:57.741
>> I'VE SEEN PEOPLE USING THE

11:57.808 --> 11:58.875
PLASTIC PROTECTOR SHEETS FOR

11:58.942 --> 12:00.444
THEIR KIDS' HOMEWORK TO PUT IN

12:00.510 --> 12:02.245
AS A FACE MASK.

12:02.312 --> 12:04.214
I'VE SEEN PEOPLE EVEN WEARING

12:04.281 --> 12:05.816
SKI GOGGLES, HALLOWEEN COSTUMES

12:05.882 --> 12:06.984
THAT WERE MASKS TO TRY AND COVER

12:07.050 --> 12:09.586
UP PARTS OF THEIR FACE.

12:09.653 --> 12:13.557
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

12:13.623 --> 12:14.624
THAT IS TERRIFYING, BOTH FOR THE

12:14.691 --> 12:16.560
MEDICAL WORKERS WHO ARE RISKING

12:16.626 --> 12:17.294
THEIR LIVES TO HELP PATIENTS,

12:17.361 --> 12:18.895
BUT ALSO FOR THE PATIENTS.

12:18.962 --> 12:20.163
IMAGINE BEING HOSPITALIZED FOR

12:20.230 --> 12:21.331
CORONAVIRUS AND THEN SEEING THIS

12:21.398 --> 12:22.099
WALK THROUGH THE DOOR.

12:22.165 --> 12:24.568
I'D OPT OUT.

12:24.634 --> 12:26.370
YEAH, I MIGHT DIE, BUT THAT'S

12:26.436 --> 12:27.337
BETTER THAN WHATEVER THIS FREAKY

12:27.404 --> 12:29.406
SHIT IS.

12:29.473 --> 12:31.641
AND IT'S NOT JUST MASKS ‐‐

12:31.708 --> 12:32.909
HOSPITALS ALSO NEED EQUIPMENT

12:32.976 --> 12:33.977
LIKE VENTILATORS TO HELP PEOPLE

12:34.044 --> 12:34.644
BREATHE.

12:34.711 --> 12:35.846
WITHOUT ENOUGH OF THEM, PEOPLE

12:35.912 --> 12:37.881
WILL DIE.

12:37.948 --> 12:39.316
AND YET, AS RECENTLY AS

12:39.383 --> 12:41.284
THURSDAY, TRUMP WAS CHOOSING TO

12:41.351 --> 12:43.553
NOT SO MUCH ADDRESS THE PROBLEM

12:43.620 --> 12:45.856
AS TRY AND MINIMIZE IT.

12:45.922 --> 12:47.691
WATCH HIM DISMISS A REQUEST FOR

12:47.758 --> 12:48.425
VENTILATORS FROM NEW YORK

12:48.492 --> 12:50.027
GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO.

12:50.093 --> 12:53.730
>> I HAVE A FEELING THAT A LOT

12:53.797 --> 12:54.765
OF THE NUMBERS THAT ARE BEING

12:54.831 --> 12:56.299
SAID IN SOME AREAS ARE JUST

12:56.366 --> 12:58.001
BIGGER THAN THEY'RE GOING TO BE.

12:58.068 --> 12:59.302
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU NEED 40,000

12:59.369 --> 13:01.104
OR 30,000 VENTILATORS.

13:01.171 --> 13:02.672
YOU KNOW, YOU GO INTO MAJOR

13:02.739 --> 13:03.640
HOSPITALS, SOMETIMES THEY HAVE

13:03.707 --> 13:04.808
TWO VENTILATORS.

13:04.875 --> 13:05.809
AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY'RE

13:05.876 --> 13:06.810
SAYING, CAN WE ORDER 30,000

13:06.877 --> 13:08.879
VENTILATORS?

13:08.945 --> 13:09.813
>> John: YEAH, THAT'S THE

13:09.880 --> 13:11.982
PROBLEM.

13:12.049 --> 13:13.717
HOSPITALS DON'T HAVE

13:13.784 --> 13:17.621
MANY VENTILATORS, AND NOW

13:17.687 --> 13:18.321
THERE'S A PANDEMIC.

13:18.388 --> 13:19.156
TRUMP MUST BE SO CONFUSED BY

13:19.222 --> 13:20.323
FIRE DEPARTMENTS.

13:20.390 --> 13:21.658
"YOU WALK INTO MOST HOUSES,

13:21.725 --> 13:23.026
THEY'VE GOT SOME SINKS, MAYBE A

13:23.093 --> 13:24.227
FEW CUPS, NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN

13:24.294 --> 13:25.062
THEY'RE ON FIRE AND THEY SAY

13:25.128 --> 13:25.896
THEY NEED HUNDREDS OF GALLONS OF

13:25.962 --> 13:26.730
WATER SPRAYED AT THEM WITH

13:26.797 --> 13:28.031
HOSES.

13:28.098 --> 13:30.500
I JUST DON'T BUY IT."

13:30.567 --> 13:31.868
AND THE THING IS, MEDICAL

13:31.935 --> 13:32.803
EQUIPMENT SHORTAGES ARE A

13:32.869 --> 13:34.071
PROBLEM THAT TRUMP ACTUALLY

13:34.137 --> 13:37.474
COULD HELP SOLVE.

13:37.541 --> 13:38.975
AS A WARTIME PRESIDENT, HE HAS A

13:39.042 --> 13:39.743
MAJOR TOOL AT HIS DISPOSAL:

13:39.810 --> 13:41.778
THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT.

13:41.845 --> 13:43.346
IT ENABLES THE FEDERAL

13:43.413 --> 13:45.248
GOVERNMENT TO COMPEL COMPANIES

13:45.315 --> 13:46.416
TO PRIORITIZE THE PRODUCTION OF

13:46.483 --> 13:47.751
ESSENTIAL SUPPLIES.

13:47.818 --> 13:48.952
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN BEGGING HIM TO

13:49.019 --> 13:50.554
USE THAT AUTHORITY FOR WEEKS

13:50.620 --> 13:54.024
NOW, BUT HE ONLY DID SO ON THE

13:54.091 --> 13:56.093
FIRST TIME ON FRIDAY, TO FORCE

13:56.159 --> 13:57.994
GM, AND ONLY GM, TO MAKE

13:58.061 --> 14:00.063
VENTILATORS.

14:00.130 --> 14:00.931
AND IT'S NOT LIKE THE DPA CAN

14:00.997 --> 14:02.432
MAGIC THEM OUT OF NOWHERE.

14:02.499 --> 14:03.934
IT COULD STILL TAKE MONTHS FOR

14:04.000 --> 14:06.937
COMPANIES TO MAKE THEM.

14:07.003 --> 14:08.171
THAT'S WHY IT WOULD'VE BEEN

14:08.238 --> 14:10.140
NICE IF TRUMP HAD INVOKED IT

14:10.207 --> 14:11.508
FUCKING MONTHS AGO ‐‐ YOU KNOW,

14:11.575 --> 14:12.776
WHEN HE SAW IT WAS A PANDEMIC

14:12.843 --> 14:16.746
BEFORE ANYONE ELSE.

14:16.813 --> 14:18.115
AND THERE'S STILL SO MUCH MORE

14:18.181 --> 14:18.915
HE COULD BE DOING WITH THE DPA,

14:18.982 --> 14:20.450
BECAUSE IT ALSO ALLOWS THE

14:20.517 --> 14:21.751
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO TAKE

14:21.818 --> 14:23.887
CHARGE OF ALLOCATING MATERIALS,

14:23.954 --> 14:25.021
LIKE PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT, AND

14:25.088 --> 14:25.889
DIRECT THEM TO WHERE THEY'RE

14:25.956 --> 14:27.457
MOST NEEDED.

14:27.524 --> 14:29.392
AND WITHOUT THAT HAPPENING,

14:29.459 --> 14:30.827
RIGHT NOW, STATES ARE COMPETING

14:30.894 --> 14:32.162
AGAINST EACH OTHER IN A

14:32.229 --> 14:33.396
FREE‐FOR‐ALL, AS NEW YORK

14:33.463 --> 14:35.365
GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO CAN TELL

14:35.432 --> 14:36.399
YOU:

14:36.466 --> 14:37.300
>> I'M COMPETING WITH OTHER

14:37.367 --> 14:38.735
STATES.

14:38.802 --> 14:40.570
I'M BIDDING UP OTHER STATES ON

14:40.637 --> 14:41.938
THE PRICES.

14:42.005 --> 14:44.107
BECAUSE YOU HAVE MANUFACTURERS

14:44.174 --> 14:46.143
WHO SIT THERE AND CALIFORNIA

14:46.209 --> 14:48.278
OFFERS THEM $4, AND THEY SAY,

14:48.345 --> 14:50.247
"WELL, CALIFORNIA OFFERED $4,"

14:50.313 --> 14:51.915
I OFFER $5, AND ANOTHER STATE

14:51.982 --> 14:54.918
CALLS IN AND OFFERS $6.

14:54.985 --> 14:56.620
IT'S NOT THE WAY TO DO IT.

14:56.686 --> 14:58.221
>> John: NO, IT ISN'T.

14:58.288 --> 15:00.257
STATES OBVIOUSLY SHOULDN'T HAVE

15:00.323 --> 15:01.558
TO HOPE THEY CAN OUTBID EACH

15:01.625 --> 15:02.959
OTHER FOR BOXES OF LIFESAVING

15:03.026 --> 15:04.094
EQUIPMENT WHILE THE NATION

15:04.161 --> 15:05.395
WATCHES.

15:05.462 --> 15:06.897
THIS IS THE GOVERNMENT'S

15:06.963 --> 15:09.533
RESPONSE TO A PANDEMIC, NOT

15:09.599 --> 15:11.101
FUCKING "STORAGE WARS."

15:11.168 --> 15:14.971
AGAIN AND AGAIN, TRUMP HAS

15:15.038 --> 15:16.106
FAILED TO GIVE THIS CRISIS WITH

15:16.173 --> 15:17.073
THE SERIOUSNESS IT REQUIRES.

15:17.140 --> 15:17.841
AND MAKE NO MISTAKE:

15:17.908 --> 15:19.476
THIS IS SERIOUS.

15:19.543 --> 15:21.645
TOO OFTEN, PEOPLE DISCUSS THIS

15:21.711 --> 15:23.547
IN BLOODLESS TERMS, CITING THE

15:23.613 --> 15:26.216
EERINESS OF EMPTY STREETS AND

15:26.283 --> 15:28.385
CLOSED SCHOOLS.

15:28.451 --> 15:30.387
BUT WHILE THE STREETS MIGHT BE

15:30.453 --> 15:32.289
EMPTY, HOSPITALS ARE

15:32.355 --> 15:33.890
INCREASINGLY BURSTING AT THE

15:33.957 --> 15:35.959
SEAMS, AND THE AGONY THIS VIRUS

15:36.026 --> 15:38.195
CAUSES IS PROFOUND.

15:38.261 --> 15:42.132
I'M SURE YOU'VE BEEN READING THE

15:42.199 --> 15:43.700
SAME STORIES I HAVE, OF THE

15:43.767 --> 15:45.168

15:45.235 --> 15:53.043
DIED FROM THIS, OR THE PARENTS

15:53.109 --> 15:54.477
OF A 25‐YEAR‐OLD WHO WAS PLACED

15:54.544 --> 15:55.145
IN A MEDICALLY INDUCED COMA.

15:55.212 --> 15:55.879
AND THE HEALTH CARE WORKERS ON

15:55.946 --> 15:56.980
THE FRONT LINES KNOW THAT THIS

15:57.047 --> 15:57.614
IS JUST THE BEGINNING.

15:57.681 --> 15:58.715
>> TODAY IS KIND OF GETTING

15:58.782 --> 16:00.217
WORSE AND WORSE.

16:00.283 --> 16:02.152
WE HAD TO GET A REFRIGERATED

16:02.219 --> 16:04.154
TRUCK TO STORE THE BODIES OF

16:04.221 --> 16:07.290
PATIENTS WHO ARE DYING.

16:07.357 --> 16:08.959

16:09.025 --> 16:10.393
TRY TO GET A FEW ADDITIONAL

16:10.460 --> 16:12.996

16:13.063 --> 16:14.431
>> I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT

16:14.497 --> 16:15.899
THIS IS BAD.

16:15.966 --> 16:17.701
PEOPLE ARE DYING.

16:17.767 --> 16:19.836
WE DON'T HAVE THE TOOLS THAT WE

16:19.903 --> 16:21.938
NEED IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT

16:22.005 --> 16:23.173
AND IN THE HOSPITAL TO TAKE CARE

16:23.240 --> 16:24.007
OF THEM.

16:24.074 --> 16:28.945
AND...

16:29.012 --> 16:30.814
AND IT'S REALLY HARD.

16:30.880 --> 16:32.782
>> John: YEAH.

16:32.849 --> 16:34.718
AND THIS WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE

16:34.784 --> 16:36.753
HARD, BUT IT ACTUALLY DIDN'T

16:36.820 --> 16:42.025
NEED TO BE THIS HARD.

16:42.092 --> 16:42.792
AND THAT IS WHY IT'S SO

16:42.859 --> 16:43.593
PROFOUNDLY DISHEARTENING THAT WE

16:43.660 --> 16:44.694
ARE BEING LED THROUGH THIS

16:44.761 --> 16:45.795
CRISIS BY A MAN WHO MAY BE LESS

16:45.862 --> 16:47.197
EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH THIS

16:47.264 --> 16:47.998
HISTORICAL MOMENT THAN ANYBODY

16:48.064 --> 16:50.000
IN RECORDED HISTORY.

16:50.066 --> 16:51.334
JUST WATCH WHAT HAPPENED WHEN

16:51.401 --> 16:52.802
ONE REPORTER PRESSED HIM ON

16:52.869 --> 16:53.937
WHETHER HIS EASTER DEADLINE WAS

16:54.004 --> 16:55.805
WISE:

16:55.872 --> 16:57.440
>> LAWMAKERS AND ECONOMISTS ON

16:57.507 --> 16:58.408
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE HAVE

16:58.475 --> 16:59.509
SAID THAT REOPENING THE COUNTRY

16:59.576 --> 17:00.910
BY EASTER IS NOT A GOOD IDEA.

17:00.977 --> 17:03.179
WHAT IS THAT PLAN BASED ON?

17:03.246 --> 17:04.381
>> JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND ‐‐

17:04.447 --> 17:05.382
ARE YOU READY?

17:05.448 --> 17:06.182
I THINK THERE ARE CERTAIN PEOPLE

17:06.249 --> 17:07.050
THAT WOULD LIKE IT NOT TO OPEN

17:07.117 --> 17:08.518
SO QUICKLY.

17:08.585 --> 17:11.254
I THINK THERE ARE CERTAIN PEOPLE

17:11.321 --> 17:12.455
THAT WOULD LIKE IT TO DO

17:12.522 --> 17:13.423
FINANCIALLY POORLY BECAUSE THEY

17:13.490 --> 17:14.257
THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY GOOD AS

17:14.324 --> 17:15.191
FAR AS DEFEATING ME AT THE

17:15.258 --> 17:17.527
POLLS.

17:17.594 --> 17:19.429
AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SO,

17:19.496 --> 17:21.097
BUT I DO THINK IT'S SO THAT A

17:21.164 --> 17:21.998
LOT OF ‐‐ THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE

17:22.065 --> 17:23.366
IN YOUR PROFESSION THAT WOULD

17:23.433 --> 17:28.938
LIKE THAT TO HAPPEN.

17:29.005 --> 17:30.206
>> John: OH, FOR FUCK'S SAKE!

17:30.273 --> 17:31.308
NO ONE IS THINKING ABOUT YOU!

17:31.374 --> 17:32.976
THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT REVOLVE

17:33.043 --> 17:33.943
AROUND YOU!

17:34.010 --> 17:35.545
FOR ONCE SOMETHING HAS COME

17:35.612 --> 17:36.680
ALONG THAT IS MORE TOXIC AND

17:36.746 --> 17:38.081
MORE THREATENING THAN THIS

17:38.148 --> 17:39.616
PRESIDENT, AND SOMEHOW, HE'S GOT

17:39.683 --> 17:42.252
FUCKING STAGE ENVY.

17:42.319 --> 17:43.586
AND LOOK, I KNOW THIS ISN'T

17:43.653 --> 17:45.655
EXACTLY THE FIRST TIME I'VE

17:45.722 --> 17:47.157
CRITICIZED DONALD TRUMP, BUT I

17:47.223 --> 17:48.792
CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH I WAS

17:48.858 --> 17:49.959
ROOTING FOR HIM TO DO THIS

17:50.026 --> 17:52.529
BETTER.

17:52.595 --> 17:53.830
HANDLING A CRISIS WELL IS NOT

17:53.897 --> 17:55.932
INHERENTLY POLITICAL.

17:55.999 --> 17:57.867
TAKE OHIO GOVERNOR MIKE DeWINE.

17:57.934 --> 18:02.706
I DISAGREE WITH BASICALLY

18:02.772 --> 18:03.573
EVERYTHING, BUT

18:03.640 --> 18:04.774
HE'S DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB SO

18:04.841 --> 18:05.875
FAR.

18:05.942 --> 18:07.610
ALSO, IF I'M HONEST, I NEVER

18:07.677 --> 18:09.979
REALLY LIKED ANDREW CUOMO BEFORE

18:10.046 --> 18:12.115
THIS, BUT I'LL ADMIT, HE'S DOING

18:12.182 --> 18:13.583
ADMIRABLY WELL, AND I CAN'T WAIT

18:13.650 --> 18:15.151
TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS

18:15.218 --> 18:16.553
WHEN I CAN GO BACK TO BEING

18:16.619 --> 18:19.055
IRRITATED BY HIM AGAIN.

18:19.122 --> 18:21.558
AND I WISH I COULD HONESTLY SAY

18:21.624 --> 18:22.659
THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE FINE, BUT

18:22.726 --> 18:24.127
I DON'T KNOW THAT.

18:24.194 --> 18:26.363
MOST OF US WILL, BUT NOT ALL OF

18:26.429 --> 18:28.365
US, AND THE NUMBER WHO WON'T IS

18:28.431 --> 18:30.600
VERY MUCH UP IN THE AIR RIGHT

18:30.667 --> 18:33.403
NOW.

18:33.470 --> 18:34.204
WHAT'S CLEAR IS THAT A CRISIS OF

18:34.270 --> 18:35.438
THIS MAGNITUDE ENDS UP REVEALING

18:35.505 --> 18:36.906
A LOT ABOUT WHO YOU ARE AS A

18:36.973 --> 18:37.941
NATION, AND NOT ALL OF WHAT'S

18:38.007 --> 18:39.909
BEING REVEALED IS GOOD.

18:39.976 --> 18:42.312
THIS VIRUS IS EXPOSING SOME

18:42.379 --> 18:43.913
CENTRAL VULNERABILITIES IN OUR

18:43.980 --> 18:46.449
MEDICAL SYSTEM, OUR POLITICAL

18:46.516 --> 18:48.952
SYSTEM, AND OUR NATIONAL PSYCHE.

19:05.568 --> 19:06.803

19:06.870 --> 19:08.938
THAT WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY DRAW

19:09.005 --> 19:11.708
OUT THE AGONY OF THIS CRISIS.

19:11.775 --> 19:12.909
MEANWHILE, WE ARE BEING FORCED

19:12.976 --> 19:15.345
TO CONFRONT SOME OF THE

19:15.412 --> 19:18.181
STRANGEST, DARKEST IMPLICATIONS

19:18.248 --> 19:19.082
OF OUR NATIONAL MINDSET, IN

19:19.149 --> 19:24.020
WHICH MARKET WORSHIP THREATENS

19:24.087 --> 19:25.889
TO BECOME A FUCKING DEATH CULT.

19:25.955 --> 19:27.791
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THIS VIRUS

19:27.857 --> 19:29.692
HAS EXPOSED SOME RESERVES OF

19:29.759 --> 19:31.227
REAL STRENGTH IN THIS COUNTRY.

19:31.294 --> 19:33.730
WE'VE SEEN EXTRAORDINARY

19:33.797 --> 19:39.335
HEROISM, KINDNESS, AND INGENUITY

19:39.402 --> 19:40.570
FROM EVERYONE IN THE CENTRAL

19:52.882 --> 19:54.851
NOW IS HELP THEM.

19:54.918 --> 19:57.420
RIGHT NOW, WHAT WE ALL CHOOSE TO

19:57.487 --> 19:59.355
DO OUTSIDE OF OUR HOSPITALS HAS

19:59.422 --> 20:00.757
A DIRECT AND SIGNIFICANT IMPACT

20:00.824 --> 20:03.026

22:54.831 --> 22:55.932
ENORMOUS BODY WITH BULLETS AND

22:55.999 --> 22:56.532
DUMPING HIM INTO THE

22:56.599 --> 22:57.700
ATLANTIC OCEAN.

22:57.767 --> 22:59.135
IT'S THE ONLY RESPONSIBLE WAY TO

22:59.202 --> 23:03.406
DO THAT.

23:03.473 --> 23:04.641
AND IF YOU ARE WORRIED YOU'RE

23:04.707 --> 23:05.808
RUNNING OUT OF CONTENT THAT CAN

23:05.875 --> 23:08.277
HELP YOU MENTALLY ESCAPE, THEN

23:08.344 --> 23:09.779
YOU'RE ACTUALLY IN LUCK, BECAUSE

23:09.846 --> 23:11.247
I WAS RECENTLY INTRODUCED TO ONE

23:11.314 --> 23:12.882
OF THE GREATEST PIECES OF

23:12.949 --> 23:13.983
TELEVISION EVER BROADCAST, AND

23:14.050 --> 23:16.686
IT BEGINS LIKE THIS:

23:16.753 --> 23:19.188
>> THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR

23:19.255 --> 23:21.257
BEING HERE, AND WELCOME TO THE

23:21.324 --> 23:23.026
1992 EDITION OF GALLERY 33, THIS

23:23.092 --> 23:24.527
ANNUAL EVENT WHEN WE CELEBRATE

23:24.594 --> 23:25.762
THE RICHNESS OF THE ARTISTIC

23:25.828 --> 23:27.063
TALENT OF THE SOUTH CENTRAL

23:27.130 --> 23:29.999
PENNSYLVANIA AREA.

23:30.066 --> 23:31.734
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, IS THAT

23:31.801 --> 23:36.506
WHAT 1992 LOOKED LIKE?

23:36.572 --> 23:37.173
'CAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE 1988 WENT

23:37.240 --> 23:38.307
TO A PARTY WHERE THE THEME WAS

23:38.374 --> 23:39.976
1983.

23:40.043 --> 23:41.744
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE 1992 TO GET

23:41.811 --> 23:44.013
TO SOUTH CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA?

23:44.080 --> 23:45.782
IS IT CURRENTLY 2011 DOWN THERE?

23:45.848 --> 23:47.884
AND, IF SO, CAN I PLEASE MOVE TO

23:47.950 --> 23:49.485
SOUTH CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA?

23:49.552 --> 23:51.821
IT SOUNDS WONDERFUL.

23:51.888 --> 23:53.322
BUT STILL, NOTHING PARTICULARLY

23:53.389 --> 23:55.324
OUT OF THE ORDINARY SO FAR.

23:55.391 --> 23:57.827
JUST A LOCAL TV ART AUCTION.

23:57.894 --> 24:01.264
NOTHING TO SEE HERE.

24:01.330 --> 24:03.433
OH, APART FROM THIS:

24:03.499 --> 24:05.902
>> THE NEXT ITEM, NUMBER 71.

24:05.968 --> 24:07.437
IT IS A WATERCOLOR TITLED

24:07.503 --> 24:09.605
"SURFACING" BY BRIAN SWORDS OF

24:09.672 --> 24:10.807
YORK.

24:10.873 --> 24:12.475
>> BRIAN SWORD'S WORK SELLS

24:12.542 --> 24:13.776
ABSOLUTELY MARVELOUSLY HERE ON

24:13.843 --> 24:16.813
GALLERY 33.

24:16.879 --> 24:18.848
HIS CARTOON CHARACTERS ARE

24:18.915 --> 24:20.450
DELIGHTFUL, AND I THINK HE ‐‐

24:20.516 --> 24:21.818
HE LETS US EACH IMAGINE WHATEVER

24:21.884 --> 24:22.985
WE'D LIKE TO WITH THESE THINGS.

24:23.052 --> 24:24.153
THESE TWO RATS ARE JUMPING UP

24:24.220 --> 24:25.421
OUT OF THE WATER.

24:25.488 --> 24:26.923
>> John: ARE THEY?

24:26.989 --> 24:28.991
ARE THEY, THOUGH?

24:29.058 --> 24:30.326
ARE THEY REALLY "JUMPING OUT OF

24:30.393 --> 24:32.128
THE WATER"?

24:32.195 --> 24:33.796
I GUESS THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF

24:33.863 --> 24:34.997
BRIAN SWORDS' WORK.

24:35.064 --> 24:36.365
LIKE ALL GREAT ART, IT'S OPEN TO

24:36.432 --> 24:37.734
INTERPRETATION.

24:37.800 --> 24:40.636
THAT WOMAN MIGHT SEE TWO RATS

24:40.703 --> 24:44.073
JUMPING OUT OF THE WATER WHILE I

24:44.140 --> 24:45.742
SEE ONE RAT ABSOLUTELY

24:45.808 --> 24:46.909
DINING OUT ON THAT OTHER RAT.

24:46.976 --> 24:49.178
THERE'S NO RIGHT ANSWER.

24:49.245 --> 24:51.447
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT SIDE

24:51.514 --> 24:53.049
YOU'RE ON HERE, IT MIGHT HELP TO

24:53.116 --> 24:53.916
SEE ANOTHER PIECE THAT SWORDS

24:53.983 --> 24:56.352
DONATED THAT DAY.

24:56.419 --> 24:57.787
>> BRIAN HAS SENT US ANOTHER

24:57.854 --> 24:58.521
PIECE THAT WE KNOW IS GOING TO

24:58.588 --> 24:59.889
SELL LIKE HOTCAKES.

24:59.956 --> 25:01.090
HIS WORK IS JUST ADMIRED AND

25:01.157 --> 25:02.291
COLLECTED BY LOTS AND LOTS OF

25:02.358 --> 25:03.860
PEOPLE.

25:03.926 --> 25:05.294
IT'S THE KIND OF A THING WHERE

25:05.361 --> 25:05.895
YOU JUST READ IT FOR WHAT IT

25:05.962 --> 25:06.629
SAYS TO YOU.

25:06.696 --> 25:07.697
VERY DELIGHTFUL.

25:07.764 --> 25:10.199
VERY DELIGHTFUL.

25:10.266 --> 25:11.334
>> AND EVERYONE ENJOYS IT.

25:11.400 --> 25:12.135
IT'S ITEM NUMBER 70, WATERCOLOR

25:12.201 --> 25:12.969
"SHEETS AND PILLOWCASES," BY

25:13.035 --> 25:14.937
BRIAN SWORDS OF YORK.

25:15.004 --> 25:16.806
AGAIN, 19 INCHES WIDE, 24 HIGH.

25:16.873 --> 25:18.741
THE ASSIGNED VALUE, $75.

25:18.808 --> 25:20.643
>> John: YES, THE ASSIGNED VALUE

25:20.710 --> 25:22.145
FOR "SHEETS AND PILLOWCASES" BY

25:22.211 --> 25:24.914
BRIAN SWORDS OF YORK WAS $75.

25:24.981 --> 25:25.882
NOW, IS THAT TOO LITTLE?

25:25.948 --> 25:30.019
TOO MUCH?

25:30.086 --> 25:31.354
I GUESS I WOULD SAY "FUCK YES"

25:31.420 --> 25:32.321
AND "FUCK NO," RESPECTIVELY.

25:32.388 --> 25:33.990
BUT I ACCEPT I COULD BE READING

25:34.056 --> 25:35.291
TOO MUCH INTO THIS.

25:35.358 --> 25:36.759
MAYBE THESE TWO RATS ARE JUST

25:36.826 --> 25:37.827
INNOCENT FRIENDS WHO LIKE TO

25:37.894 --> 25:40.296
SMOKE CIGARETTES BY CANDLELIGHT

25:40.363 --> 25:41.664
AND HUG EACH OTHER AROUND THE

25:41.731 --> 25:42.398
WAIST IN POSITIONS THAT MAKE IT

25:42.465 --> 25:43.699
IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE THEIR

25:43.766 --> 25:45.368
FLAGRANTLY VISIBLE GENITALS.

25:45.434 --> 25:46.536
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT RAT FRIENDSHIP

25:46.602 --> 25:47.970
IS ALL ABOUT.

25:48.037 --> 25:49.071
I DON'T KNOW.

25:49.138 --> 25:50.406
I'M NOT A RAT, DESPITE ALL

25:50.473 --> 25:52.942
EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY.

25:53.009 --> 25:54.110
BUT I THINK I KNOW WHAT MIGHT

25:54.177 --> 25:58.247
DECIDE THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL.

25:58.314 --> 26:00.783
PLEASE BRING ON ITEM 734.

26:00.850 --> 26:02.151
>> ITEM 734 NEXT.

26:02.218 --> 26:03.953
A WATERCOLOR TITLED

26:04.020 --> 26:05.254
"THE SMELL OF WET FUR,"

26:05.321 --> 26:06.823
BY BRIAN SWORDS OF YORK.

26:06.889 --> 26:08.457
>> THIS IS ANOTHER IN A

26:08.524 --> 26:09.692
CONTINUING SERIES BY

26:09.759 --> 26:11.961
BRIAN SWORDS OF HIS VERY AMUSING

26:12.028 --> 26:13.763
DRAWINGS AND PAINTINGS OF RATS

26:13.830 --> 26:19.368
IN UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES.

26:19.435 --> 26:20.570
IN THIS CASE, "THE SMELL

26:20.636 --> 26:21.604
OF WET FUR," TWO IN A HOT TUB,

26:21.671 --> 26:23.306
OBVIOUSLY ENJOYING THE EVENING.

26:23.372 --> 26:24.473
AND WHAT MORE CAN POSSIBLY BE

26:24.540 --> 26:25.341
SAID?

26:25.408 --> 26:26.108
>> John: WHAT MORE COULD BE

26:26.175 --> 26:27.043
SAID?

26:27.109 --> 26:28.845
A LOT.

26:28.911 --> 26:30.479
A LOT MORE CAN BE SAID.

26:30.546 --> 26:31.814
I COULD SPEND A FULL

26:31.881 --> 26:33.349
DISSERTATION EXAMINING THE

26:33.416 --> 26:34.750
SUBTLE BRILLIANCE OF THIS WORK

26:34.817 --> 26:37.019
ALONE.

26:37.086 --> 26:38.654
IT WOULD BE CALLED, "RATFUCKED:

26:38.721 --> 26:41.190
PASSION AND PATHOS IN

26:41.257 --> 26:42.625
BRIAN SWORDS OF YORK'S

26:42.692 --> 26:43.459
GREY PERIOD,"

26:43.526 --> 26:44.393
AND YES, I'VE ALREADY WRITTEN

26:44.460 --> 26:44.861
IT.

26:44.927 --> 26:45.928
THIS QUARANTINE HAS ALREADY BEEN

26:45.995 --> 26:47.196
PRODUCTIVE.

26:47.263 --> 26:48.598
BUT EVERY ARTIST

26:48.664 --> 26:49.432
EVENTUALLY PAINTS THEIR

26:49.498 --> 26:51.500
MASTERPIECE, AND "THE SMELL

26:51.567 --> 26:53.002
OF WET FUR" ISN'T EVEN SWORDS OF

26:53.069 --> 26:53.769
YORK AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS

26:53.836 --> 26:56.639
TALENTS.

26:56.706 --> 26:58.507
FOR THAT, I GIVE YOU LOT 735.

26:58.574 --> 27:01.577
>> ITEM NUMBER 735 IS A

27:01.644 --> 27:02.912
WATERCOLOR, "STAY UP LATE" BY

27:02.979 --> 27:04.881
BRIAN SWORDS OF YORK.

27:04.947 --> 27:07.016
IT'S 24 BY 18 INCHES.

27:07.083 --> 27:08.951
>> WELL, BRIAN'S WORK BEGAN ‐‐

27:09.018 --> 27:11.554
THE BIOHAZARD SERIES BEGAN AS A

27:11.621 --> 27:13.422
STATEMENT ABOUT BRUTALITY TO

27:13.489 --> 27:14.457
EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS AND HAS

27:14.523 --> 27:16.192
DEVELOPED INTO A WHOLE SCENE OF

27:16.259 --> 27:17.827
THESE ‐‐ THESE RATHER UNUSUAL

27:17.894 --> 27:19.128
RATS INVOLVED IN ALL TYPES OF

27:19.195 --> 27:20.663
NORMAL HUMAN ACTIVITIES.

27:20.730 --> 27:22.164
>> John: MAGNIFICENT.

27:22.231 --> 27:23.733
FIRST, KUDOS TO THAT

27:23.799 --> 27:27.136
CAMERA OPERATOR.

27:27.203 --> 27:28.204
THAT IS THE BEST USE OF A

27:28.271 --> 27:28.671
SLOW PAN I'VE SEEN

27:28.738 --> 27:30.006
IN A LONG TIME.

27:30.072 --> 27:31.774
BUT TWO, WHY ARE THOSE RATS

27:31.841 --> 27:33.976
"UNUSUAL" TO YOU?

27:34.043 --> 27:35.945
IS IT THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE

27:36.012 --> 27:37.980
HUMAN TORSOS BUT RAT HEADS?

27:38.047 --> 27:39.882
OR THAT THEY HAVE BUTTS WITH

27:39.949 --> 27:40.783
TWO CHEEKS, BUT ALSO TAILS

27:40.850 --> 27:43.085
POKING OUT OF THEM?

27:43.152 --> 27:44.854
IS IT THE FACT THEY HAVE HANDS

27:44.921 --> 27:46.255
WITH GRASPING FINGERS AND

27:46.322 --> 27:47.323
OPPOSABLE THUMBS BUT ONLY FOUR

27:47.390 --> 27:49.225
OF THEM?

27:49.292 --> 27:50.393
OR IS IT THAT IN A WORLD

27:50.459 --> 27:51.894
DEFINED BY ICY DISTANCE, THEY

27:51.961 --> 27:52.962
AREN'T AFRAID TO RECKLESSLY LOVE

27:53.029 --> 27:53.829
ANOTHER SOUL BETTER THAN MOST

27:53.896 --> 27:57.366
PEOPLE COULD LOVE THEMSELVES?

27:57.433 --> 27:58.901
BECAUSE IF THAT'S UNUSUAL, THEN

27:58.968 --> 28:01.804
BUDDY, I DON'T WANNA BE USUAL.

28:01.871 --> 28:05.508
SO LOOK, HERE'S THE THING.

28:05.574 --> 28:06.809
DID I ENJOY STUMBLING OVER THESE

28:06.876 --> 28:08.344
CLIPS AND THE WORK OF AN

28:08.411 --> 28:09.912
UNDISCOVERED ARTISTIC PIONEER?

28:09.979 --> 28:11.580
YES.

28:11.647 --> 28:13.082
DID IT MAKE ME FEEL A LITTLE

28:13.149 --> 28:14.583
BETTER AFTER WEEKS OF FEELING

28:14.650 --> 28:16.352
REALLY DEPRESSED?

28:16.419 --> 28:17.820
YEAH, IT DID.

28:17.887 --> 28:21.023
BUT IT ALSO GAVE ME AN IDEA.

28:21.090 --> 28:22.725
BECAUSE CLEARLY WE'RE STUCK FOR

28:22.792 --> 28:24.560
THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE DOING

28:24.627 --> 28:25.895
THIS SHOW IN A HYPER‐REDUCED

28:25.962 --> 28:27.296
FORMAT, AND THAT'S NOT REALLY

28:27.363 --> 28:30.733
THE HBO WAY.

28:30.800 --> 28:31.567
IS IT?

28:31.634 --> 28:32.802
THERE'S A REASON

28:32.868 --> 28:33.769
"GAME OF THRONES" WASN'T CALLED

28:33.836 --> 28:35.071
"GAME OF FOLDING CHAIRS AND

28:35.137 --> 28:36.439
NORMAL‐SIZED LIZARDS."

28:36.505 --> 28:37.673
AND THIS NETWORK CERTAINLY NEVER

28:37.740 --> 28:39.208
PLANNED ON FOLLOWING UP

28:39.275 --> 28:41.277
"DRAGONS FIGHT ZOMBIE ARMY

28:41.344 --> 28:42.445
OVER BIG ICE WALL" WITH A SINGLE

28:42.511 --> 28:43.813
SHOT OF A GUY WHO HASN'T LEFT

28:43.879 --> 28:46.248
HIS HOME IN TWO WEEKS.

28:46.315 --> 28:48.250
SO THAT MEANS TWO THINGS:

28:48.317 --> 28:52.521
ONE, WE HAVE SOME BUDGET LEFT

28:52.588 --> 28:52.888
OVER THIS WEEK.

28:52.955 --> 28:54.056
AND TWO, IT COMES AT A TIME WHEN

28:54.123 --> 28:54.991
I JUST GOT REALLY INTERESTED IN

28:55.057 --> 28:56.592
THE ART MARKET.

28:56.659 --> 28:57.893
NOT THE ENTIRE ART MARKET,

28:57.960 --> 28:59.161
OF COURSE ‐‐ MAINLY JUST THIS

28:59.228 --> 29:00.696
PICTURE.

29:00.763 --> 29:02.264
LET ME BE CLEAR: I WANT

29:02.331 --> 29:03.766
"STAY UP LATE" BY BRIAN SWORDS

29:03.833 --> 29:05.134
OF YORK.

29:05.201 --> 29:07.169
I KNOW SOMEONE BOUGHT IT IN 1992

29:07.236 --> 29:09.271
FOR $80.

29:09.338 --> 29:10.840
I ALSO KNOW EVERYTHING HAS ITS

29:10.906 --> 29:13.109
PRICE.

29:13.175 --> 29:14.410
SO I AM OFFERING THE CURRENT

29:14.477 --> 29:17.113
OWNER ‐‐ WHOEVER YOU ARE ‐‐

29:17.179 --> 29:19.382
$1,000, PLUS A DONATION OF

29:19.448 --> 29:20.950
$20,000 TO THE FOOD BANK IN YOUR

29:21.017 --> 29:22.184
AREA.

29:22.251 --> 29:25.521
THIS IS REAL.

29:25.588 --> 29:28.491
SO IF YOU OWN THIS MASTER WORK

29:28.557 --> 29:29.825
OR YOU KNOW THE LUCKY PERSON WHO

29:29.892 --> 29:31.794
DOES, PLEASE EMAIL

29:31.861 --> 29:33.029
John@JohnOliver

29:33.095 --> 29:34.430
WantsYourRatErotia.com,

29:34.497 --> 29:35.698
A URL THAT WAS DISAPPOINTINGLY

29:35.765 --> 29:36.899
AVAILABLE.

29:36.966 --> 29:38.267
BECAUSE I WANT THAT PIECE OF ART

29:38.334 --> 29:40.002
HANGING BEHIND ME ON THIS WALL

29:40.069 --> 29:41.370
NEXT WEEK.

29:41.437 --> 29:42.605
AND IF I DON'T GET IT, I WILL

29:42.671 --> 29:46.208
KEEP LOOKING FOR IT.

29:46.275 --> 29:49.111
BECAUSE THIS IS AMERICA, WHERE,

29:49.178 --> 29:50.579
SURE, SURE, YOU CAN'T GET A TEST

29:50.646 --> 29:52.648
FOR COVID‐19 OR PURELL OR A

29:52.715 --> 29:54.183
VENTILATOR OR A SENSE OF EMPATHY

29:54.250 --> 29:56.519
FROM THE PERSON IN CHARGE, BUT

29:56.585 --> 29:58.754
IF YOU TRY HARD ENOUGH, DAMN IT,

29:58.821 --> 30:01.057
YOU CAN GET A PICTURE OF TWO

30:01.123 --> 30:03.125
NUDE RATS LOCKED IN PASSIONATE

30:03.192 --> 30:04.393
POST‐FUCK EMBRACE HANGING ON

30:04.460 --> 30:05.928
YOUR WALL.

30:05.995 --> 30:07.096
YOU HAVE TO STILL BE ABLE TO GET

30:07.163 --> 30:10.099
THAT.
