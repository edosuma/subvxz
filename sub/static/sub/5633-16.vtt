was a great idea.

Oh, not great. Amazing.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.705
Hmm, now that
I think about it,

10:06.707 --> 10:09.174
that idea did have
a lot of problems.

♪

10:13.447 --> 10:14.879
Greetings, candidates.

10:14.881 --> 10:16.881
The testing that begins
today will determine

10:16.883 --> 10:20.051
which of you have the necessary
skills to thrive on Mars.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.620

it will feel

Valles Marineris

Blue Bronco
is just one

10:28.629 --> 10:30.629
of this mission's many
corporate partners.

10:30.631 --> 10:33.632
Because this is a privately
funded entrepreneurial mission,

10:33.634 --> 10:36.635
we've teamed up with some of
America's most exciting brands.

on this mission

11:13.640 --> 11:16.107
to make mankind
a two-planet species?

11:16.109 --> 11:18.109
Mars is the ultimate field trip.

11:18.111 --> 11:21.146

the gift shop is immortality.

11:21.148 --> 11:22.947
Also, I'm drowning in debt.

Well, I hope to establish a
planet of perfect equality-ment.

On Mars,
you are my servant.

12:08.995 --> 12:12.330
We were so inspired
by you being inspired.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.899
A family unit could be
perfect for this mission.

have the guts

just announced that their Mars
rocket is nearing completion.

the first cookie on Mars.

that neither of them
actually wants to go to Mars?

18:52.899 --> 18:54.465
I'm not giving up yet.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.068
There's got to be a limit
to their stubbornness, right?

18:57.070 --> 18:59.403
FLIGHT DIRECTOR:
T-minus one minute to launch.

18:59.405 --> 19:02.039
HOMER:
D'oh!

19:04.076 --> 19:06.944
Here we go! I guess.

19:06.946 --> 19:08.079
Yep.

19:08.081 --> 19:10.081
We're doing this,
apparently.

19:10.083 --> 19:12.083
I'm sorry
I doubted you, Mom.

19:12.085 --> 19:14.652
There's no one I would
rather go to Mars with.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.754
I love you, sweetie.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.022
I love you, too.

19:19.591 --> 19:21.092
I don't want to go!

19:21.094 --> 19:23.794
This is the stupidest
idea we ever had!

19:23.796 --> 19:26.164
Abort launch!

19:26.166 --> 19:27.765
That's a negative.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.934
I think you're forgetting
the motto of Blue Bronco:

19:29.936 --> 19:31.102
"Let's do this thing."

19:31.104 --> 19:32.170
FLIGHT DIRECTOR:
Twelve...

19:32.172 --> 19:33.171
<i>eleven...</i>

19:33.173 --> 19:34.438
HOMER:
<i>This is not happening.</i>

19:34.440 --> 19:35.940
Do you know how
to run the dishwasher?

19:35.942 --> 19:36.941
Of course not!

19:36.943 --> 19:38.509
Maybe we can use
paper plates!

19:38.511 --> 19:40.311
Where the hell do we get those?

19:40.313 --> 19:41.779
Mom, no!
Marge, no!

19:41.781 --> 19:43.014
FLIGHT DIRECTOR:
...three...

19:43.016 --> 19:44.982
two... one...

19:44.984 --> 19:47.051
Ignition!

19:48.320 --> 19:49.787
It's not a real rocket.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.122
It's the outside
of a real rocket.

19:51.124 --> 19:53.124
We did plan to build
a real rocket.

19:53.126 --> 19:55.459
And that's one thing they can
never take away from us.

19:55.461 --> 19:57.628
That plan is our legacy.

19:57.630 --> 20:00.364
Then why did you move up the
launch if you knew it was fake?

20:00.366 --> 20:02.200
To inspire
the next generation.

20:02.202 --> 20:05.002
And to provide a distraction
while we drove away.

20:05.004 --> 20:06.671
Then why are
you still here?

20:06.673 --> 20:08.072
Our car wouldn't start.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.544
Mom, doesn't it frighten you

20:13.546 --> 20:16.514
that we almost went to Mars
out of sheer stubbornness?

20:16.516 --> 20:19.717
That's what a mother-daughter
relationship is, sweetie.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.987
A series of near-fatal
emotional standoffs.

20:22.989 --> 20:25.022
Okay, but it doesn't
have to be that way.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.824
Surely we can
learn from this.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.326
One day,
we'll figure it out.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.695
On this planet or another.

(chickens clucking)

20:37.002 --> 20:38.502
It's my life!

20:38.504 --> 20:39.904
If I want to leave Mars

20:39.906 --> 20:42.907
and move to Venus,
you can't stop me!

20:42.909 --> 20:44.175
(annoyed grunt)

20:44.177 --> 20:46.177
Mom's always trying
to hold me back.

20:46.179 --> 20:48.079
I know, I know.

20:48.081 --> 20:50.081
I can't be her
little girl forever.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.016
That must be
really hard for you.

20:52.018 --> 20:55.686
Nod-Bot is so sorry you
have to go through this.

20:55.688 --> 20:56.921
Thank you.
