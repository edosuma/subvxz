00:00.066 --> 00:03.135
Adult adam:  <i>Back in the '80s,</i>
<i>you couldn't keep up</i>
<i>with all the new dance styles.</i>

00:03.137 --> 00:06.372
<i>There was breakin', poppin'</i>
<i>and lockin', the running man,</i>

00:06.374 --> 00:08.707
<i>And something called</i>
<i>the electric boogaloo.</i>

00:08.709 --> 00:11.577
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>I had two left feet.</i>

00:11.579 --> 00:15.114
<i>I often found walking</i>
<i>a hard enough challenge.</i>

00:15.116 --> 00:16.315
You okay?

00:16.317 --> 00:17.449
Me? Yeah.
(chuckles)

00:17.451 --> 00:20.519
Been working out a lot.
My quads locked up on me.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.221
That ever happen to you?

00:22.223 --> 00:23.555
Um, no.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.090
Das coo', das coo'.

00:25.092 --> 00:27.559
(chuckles)
here you go.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.361
Well, thanks for the help.

00:30.764 --> 00:33.432
Hey, um, you going
to the dance Friday?

00:33.434 --> 00:35.868
Are you going?
Yeah, maybe.

00:35.870 --> 00:36.568
Save me a dance?

00:36.570 --> 00:40.005
Oh, definitely.
Sounds scrumptious.

00:40.240 --> 00:42.174
Adult adam:
<i>Dana was amazing.</i>

00:42.176 --> 00:43.075
<i>She wanted to dance with me,</i>

00:43.077 --> 00:45.477
<i>And she didn't care</i>
<i>that I used words</i>
<i>like "scrumptious."</i>

00:45.479 --> 00:47.946
<i>Nothing was gonna</i>
<i>bring me down.</i>

00:47.948 --> 00:48.580
Beverly: Adam!

00:48.582 --> 00:51.683
Hurry up! We're late
for your dentist appointment!

00:51.685 --> 00:53.419
<i>Well, almost nothing.</i>

00:53.421 --> 00:55.020
Do you need to make...

00:55.022 --> 00:55.754
Make poo-poos?

00:55.756 --> 00:57.122
I know you refuse
to go at school,

00:57.124 --> 00:58.223
But we don't have time
to stop at home,

00:58.225 --> 01:00.659
So if you have
to make poo-poos,
then make poo-poos here.

01:00.661 --> 01:03.796
Oh, my god! I'm fine!
Just let me in and let's go!

01:03.798 --> 01:05.497
Well, first, tell me
who that girl was.

01:05.499 --> 01:06.565
What girl?
There was no girl.

01:06.567 --> 01:07.800
You were talking
to dana caldwell.

01:07.802 --> 01:10.436
Why do you ask me
a question if you
already know the answer?

01:10.438 --> 01:11.103
Unlock the door!

01:11.105 --> 01:12.704
(singsong voice)
what were you talking about?

01:12.706 --> 01:14.073
Nothing!
What were
you talking about?

01:14.075 --> 01:16.608
Nothing!
Were you talking
about the dance?

01:16.610 --> 01:17.209
Tell me everything.

01:17.211 --> 01:18.777
Let's just go
to the dentist already!

01:18.779 --> 01:19.878
What were you
talking about?

01:19.880 --> 01:22.014
Oh, my god!
I'm the one kid
in this world

01:22.016 --> 01:24.550
Who's looking forward
to getting his teeth drilled.

01:24.552 --> 01:28.087
Sheesh.
All right, captain no fun.

01:28.089 --> 01:29.855
Adult adam:
<i>With a smother like mine,</i>

01:29.857 --> 01:32.057
<i>You have to shut</i>
<i>her down fast.</i>

01:32.059 --> 01:34.760
<i>You can't open the door,</i>
<i>even a crack.</i>

01:34.762 --> 01:35.894
Drive!

01:35.896 --> 01:39.398
So, then, dana asked adam
if he was going to the dance,

01:39.400 --> 01:40.032
And adam said yes.

01:40.034 --> 01:42.401
So, then, she said
to save her a dance.

01:42.403 --> 01:45.737
How do you know all this
if you were in the car?

01:45.739 --> 01:48.240
Sometimes
a mother just knows.

01:48.242 --> 01:51.143
And I trained myself
to read lips a little bit.

01:51.145 --> 01:52.945
Huh. Read my lips.

01:52.947 --> 01:53.979
You need help.

01:53.981 --> 01:56.115
Murray, this is a big deal.

01:56.117 --> 01:58.650
Our baby has
his first girlfriend.

01:58.652 --> 02:01.153
I think you know
what that means.

02:01.155 --> 02:03.155
It's time for the talk.
What talk?

02:03.157 --> 02:05.424
You know, about
the birds and the bees

02:05.426 --> 02:08.727
And what they do when they've
had a couple of white wines

02:08.729 --> 02:10.963
And put on
a lionel richie record?

02:10.965 --> 02:12.197
Yeah, that talk.
Not for me.

02:12.199 --> 02:14.066
Not for you?
You're his father.

02:14.068 --> 02:16.001
Just give him the same talk
you gave barry.

02:16.003 --> 02:19.304
(sighs)
ooh, here's the thing...

02:19.306 --> 02:21.273
I never did that.
What?

02:21.275 --> 02:25.244
You were supposed
to talk that talk with him
about three years ago!

02:25.246 --> 02:26.612
I know. I know.
What can I say?

02:26.614 --> 02:27.846
It got away from me.
Well, do it now.

02:27.848 --> 02:32.184
What's the rush?
There's not, like, a line
outside of his bedroom.

02:32.186 --> 02:34.386
Murray!
Fine!

02:34.388 --> 02:36.555
(no audio)

02:36.557 --> 02:39.324
No, you are a pain
in my ass!

02:39.326 --> 02:41.760
That's right.
I read lips.

02:42.362 --> 02:43.295
<i>♪ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:43.297 --> 02:48.267
<i>♪ but nonetheless</i>
<i>I feel the need to say</i>

02:49.536 --> 02:50.569
<i>♪ I don't know the future</i>

02:50.571 --> 02:53.772
<i>♪ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i>clearer every day ♪</i>

02:53.774 --> 02:56.708
Adult adam:
<i>It was November 22,</i>
<i>1980-something,</i>

02:56.710 --> 02:58.110
<i>And I was gonna</i>
<i>learn to dance.</i>

02:58.112 --> 03:00.612
What do you mean
you don't know how to dance?

03:00.614 --> 03:03.782
You're my grandson.
You've got rhythm
in your blood!

03:03.784 --> 03:05.384
I'm an open book.
Teach me.

03:05.386 --> 03:09.221
Adult adam:  <i>As always,</i>
<i>my grandfather would give me</i>
<i>all the answers I needed.</i>

03:09.223 --> 03:11.957
<i>He had never</i>
<i>failed me before.</i>

03:11.959 --> 03:13.392
A-shuffle and a-cha!

03:13.394 --> 03:15.460
(singsong voice)
a-shuffle and a-cha!

03:15.462 --> 03:17.462
A-squibbidy bee,
a-squibbidy boo!

03:17.464 --> 03:19.498
A-squibbidy bee,
a-squibbidy boo!

03:19.500 --> 03:23.335
And we take a break
'cause my foot is swollen!

03:23.337 --> 03:25.837
Adult adam:  <i>There was</i>
<i>a first time for everything.</i>

03:25.839 --> 03:27.506
<i>I had to find</i>
<i>another teacher.</i>

03:27.508 --> 03:29.174
Erica, teach me
to dance, and fast!

03:29.176 --> 03:32.077
What did he say?
Come on! Then what did he say?

03:32.079 --> 03:36.181
Please! I need
to learn how to move
my body to music!

03:36.183 --> 03:37.082
Lainey's in crisis.

03:37.084 --> 03:39.885
Her parents bought her
a new car and it's yellow!

03:39.887 --> 03:41.787
Barry: What's the matter
little buddy?

03:41.789 --> 03:43.422
Got a problem
barry can solve?

03:43.424 --> 03:45.824
No. You'll just
make fun of me.

03:45.826 --> 03:46.658
What?

03:46.660 --> 03:47.426
I would never do that.

03:47.428 --> 03:50.562
Fine. I need someone
to teach me how to dance.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.731
Ha! Loser.

03:53.366 --> 03:54.600
But you came
to the right guy.

03:54.602 --> 03:57.135
But I'm not coming to you.
Let's do this.

03:57.137 --> 04:00.172
(dance music plays)

04:17.123 --> 04:18.991
When are you gonna
start dancing?

04:18.993 --> 04:19.591
Shut up!

04:19.593 --> 04:22.661
My body's becoming
one with the beat.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.799
Airplane!

04:28.167 --> 04:30.435
The wave!

04:30.737 --> 04:32.738
Crab legs!

04:33.506 --> 04:35.474
Helicopter!

04:35.476 --> 04:37.976
And turtle spin!

04:39.112 --> 04:39.745
Breakin'.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.013
How does
any of this help me?

04:41.015 --> 04:43.248
I need to learn how
to dance with a girl!

04:43.250 --> 04:46.051
Yeah, can't help
you with that.

04:46.053 --> 04:48.086
But I can help you
with this.

04:50.023 --> 04:51.890
The worm!

04:52.325 --> 04:53.325
(thudding) ow!

04:53.327 --> 04:55.260
Adult adam:  <i>After I got</i>
<i>an ice pack for barry's face,</i>

04:55.262 --> 04:58.864
<i>I decided to teach myself</i>
<i>how to dance</i>

04:58.866 --> 05:01.533
<i>Because time was running out.</i>

05:01.535 --> 05:04.636
(dance music plays)

05:08.808 --> 05:10.976
Mm, get funky,
snuggle monkey.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.645
(panting) wait, what?
This isn't the a-team.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.515
No, leave it on.
We dance
to that in jazzercize.

05:16.517 --> 05:19.318
Adult adam:  <i>Maybe I was</i>
<i>desperate, or maybe</i>
<i>I was just hypnotized</i>

05:19.320 --> 05:23.689
<i>By my mom's</i>
<i>surprisingly sweet moves.</i>

05:25.591 --> 05:26.158
Mom...

05:26.160 --> 05:29.227
Do you think you could
teach me how to do that?

05:29.229 --> 05:32.664
Adult adam:
<i>I let her in the door.</i>

05:32.666 --> 05:33.365
Get over here.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.067
<i>For the first time,</i>
<i>my mother and I</i>

05:35.069 --> 05:37.903
<i>Were on the same team</i>
<i>with the same goal.</i>

05:37.905 --> 05:41.540
(dance music plays)

05:43.376 --> 05:44.943
There you go. Perfect.

05:44.945 --> 05:48.347
And feel free to jazz it up
with some head movements.

05:48.948 --> 05:52.484
No one's gonna tell you you're
moving your head too much.

06:01.561 --> 06:03.528
Look, we're kid 'n' play!

06:03.530 --> 06:04.996
(laughs)

06:05.465 --> 06:09.267
John travolta.
There you go.

06:09.269 --> 06:11.370
<i>It was awesome...</i>

06:11.372 --> 06:12.604
<i>Until this.</i>

06:12.606 --> 06:14.673
(slow ballad playing)

06:14.675 --> 06:16.441
Well, this has been great.
See ya!

06:16.443 --> 06:17.142
Wait a minute, mister.

06:17.144 --> 06:19.945
I'm not letting you go before
I teach you how to slow dance.

06:19.947 --> 06:20.812
No. No way.
Not interested.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.881
Sweetie, I know you
better than anyone.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.350
I know this is what's
stressing you out.

06:25.352 --> 06:27.319
Hand placement,
where do you look,

06:27.321 --> 06:29.154
How do you keep
from stepping on her feet?

06:29.156 --> 06:30.422
Those are all
valid questions, yes.

06:30.424 --> 06:35.527
Adult adam:
<i>I had come this far.</i>
<i>I couldn't turn back now.</i>

06:35.529 --> 06:38.163
Screw it.
Let's do this.

06:38.264 --> 06:40.198
First, you, uh,
put your hands on my waist.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.034
No, thank you.
Adam, I'm your mother.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.636
That's the point!

06:47.140 --> 06:50.208
Just rock back and forth,
very gently.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.644
Right and left.

06:53.212 --> 06:54.780
Right...

06:54.782 --> 06:56.214
Left.

06:56.682 --> 06:57.482
What are you doing?

06:57.484 --> 06:59.718
Ohh!
(muffled)
no snuggies! No snuggies!

06:59.720 --> 07:00.852
You smell like the dryer.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.988
No snuggies!
Honey, you're so yummy!

07:02.990 --> 07:06.057
That's not cool.
I'm out of here.

07:07.493 --> 07:08.160
But thanks for the help!

07:08.162 --> 07:10.896
And just to be clear,
I know I'm yelling,

07:10.898 --> 07:12.831
But I'm actually
very appreciative!

07:12.833 --> 07:13.932
Adult adam:
<i>While I was learning to dance,</i>

07:13.934 --> 07:16.902
<i>My dad was ready to do</i>
<i>some teaching of his own.</i>

07:16.904 --> 07:18.270
What are you doing?

07:18.272 --> 07:19.538
Eating boo berry.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.173
Good for you.

07:21.175 --> 07:22.808
Very smart.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.876
Feed your body.

07:25.077 --> 07:25.977
(laughter on tv)

07:25.979 --> 07:31.950
So, your mom found out
that I never got around
to giving you the talk.

07:31.952 --> 07:32.651
What talk?

07:32.653 --> 07:35.754
The "people
making people" talk.

07:35.756 --> 07:38.190
Ohh, that talk!

07:38.192 --> 07:39.124
Exactly!

07:39.126 --> 07:42.928
So, if she asks,
tell her we just had it.

07:42.930 --> 07:44.062
But we didn't.
We don't need to.

07:44.064 --> 07:48.600
I mean, you're a grown man,
and you know everything.

07:48.602 --> 07:50.035
Of course!
Yeah!

07:50.037 --> 07:51.837
I do have one question.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.538
Is it true you can
get a girl pregnant

07:53.540 --> 07:54.906
If you french kiss
her after midnight?

07:54.908 --> 07:57.809
What are you talking about?
Like in the movie  <i>gremlins.</i>

07:57.811 --> 08:01.112
If you kiss after midnight,
the saliva goes
into her tummy,

08:01.114 --> 08:02.647
And 'cause of her hormones
and the moon,

08:02.649 --> 08:04.950
Six weeks later,
a baby comes out.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.818
<i>Gremlins?</i>

08:06.886 --> 08:08.553
You think...

08:08.555 --> 08:10.188
How could you even?

08:10.190 --> 08:11.456
Ugh!

08:11.458 --> 08:13.525
Where are you going?
I got to regroup!

08:13.527 --> 08:15.827
I wasn't prepared for this!
I need to prepare.

08:15.829 --> 08:19.164
Adult adam:  <i>Turns out,</i>
<i>my dad's world wasn't</i>
<i>the only one caving in.</i>

08:19.166 --> 08:22.767
Do you want the rad news
or the totally rad news?

08:22.769 --> 08:24.636
Don't say "rad."
I got these on sale

08:24.638 --> 08:27.372
And thought they'd be
perfect to wear to the dance.

08:27.374 --> 08:28.073
You like 'em?

08:28.075 --> 08:30.075
They made a parachute
into clothing!

08:30.077 --> 08:31.710
Damn right,
I like 'em!

08:31.712 --> 08:32.978
And the even
better news is

08:32.980 --> 08:35.614
I will be joining you
at the dance!

08:35.616 --> 08:38.583
What?
I know! (giggles)

08:38.585 --> 08:39.718
I signed up
to be a chaperone.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.821
That way, I'll be there
to help with your moves.

08:42.823 --> 08:45.123
I don't need help.
Don't help me.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.926
All kids are embarrassed
by their parents.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.561
But don't think of me
as your mom.

08:49.563 --> 08:50.462
Think of me
as your coach.

08:50.464 --> 08:53.098
I don't want to think
of you at all when
I'm dancing with dana.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.499
You won't even know
I'm there.

08:54.501 --> 09:00.705
And if I'm lucky, I'll get
to see my little baby
have his first slow dance!

09:00.707 --> 09:04.109
Mwah!
(giggles)

09:08.014 --> 09:09.581
Adult adam:
<i>I'd done the unthinkable.</i>

09:09.583 --> 09:13.251
<i>I opened the door, and my mom</i>
<i>had burst right through it!</i>

09:13.253 --> 09:15.120
What did he say?

09:15.122 --> 09:16.988
Have you lost your mind?
(receiver thuds)

09:16.990 --> 09:18.623
I slow-danced with mom!

09:18.625 --> 09:21.159
What?
You heard me.

09:21.460 --> 09:23.795
What do you mean?
What are you saying?

09:23.797 --> 09:26.998
I slow-danced with mom.

09:27.066 --> 09:27.832
You slow-danced
with mom?

09:27.834 --> 09:30.669
This doesn't concern you!
The hell it doesn't!

09:30.671 --> 09:32.003
You can't go
slow-dancing with mom

09:32.005 --> 09:34.172
And not expect me
to have lots of opinions

09:34.174 --> 09:35.273
On this
controversial matter.

09:35.275 --> 09:36.675
It was a moment
of weakness and she
taught me how to dance,

09:36.677 --> 09:40.679
And now she's gonna be
a chaperone tonight
and totally humiliate me!

09:40.681 --> 09:41.880
Now you've opened the door.

09:41.882 --> 09:42.781
I know.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.416
Just tell me
how to close it.

09:44.418 --> 09:46.184
There is no way!

09:46.186 --> 09:48.219
Once the door's open,
it stays open forever!

09:48.221 --> 09:50.855
I sent her a letter from
camp saying I was homesick.

09:50.857 --> 09:53.158
And the next night,
she showed up in the top bunk.

09:53.160 --> 09:57.162
Look, this is a picture of us
in a canoe together!

09:57.164 --> 09:59.898
Never again, adam.
Never again!

09:59.900 --> 10:01.666
This is all so upsetting.

10:01.668 --> 10:04.970
I got to go.
I can't be here.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.505
Okay. There's got
to be a way out of this.

10:07.507 --> 10:10.508
Yes! Lies and deception!
That's your department.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.811
I'll think of something,
I promise.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.079
I love you.
Don't say that.

10:14.081 --> 10:19.184
Look into my eyes
and know that I love you.

10:19.186 --> 10:20.952
Get out!

10:23.756 --> 10:25.256
Adam: Love you!

10:27.293 --> 10:28.927
Again with the boo berry.

10:28.929 --> 10:31.129
You know it.

10:31.131 --> 10:31.930
All right.

10:31.932 --> 10:34.099
Here we go.
Time for the talk.

10:34.101 --> 10:37.469
All right, before we get down
to the nuts and bolts...

10:37.471 --> 10:39.704
(laughs) nuts.

10:39.706 --> 10:40.972
(groans)

10:40.974 --> 10:42.474
All right,
instead of talking about

10:42.476 --> 10:45.710
Male and female body parts,
we're gonna use the names

10:45.712 --> 10:50.148
Of our favorite
baseball players
as code words.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.984
Look,
you have a mike schmidt.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.319
Ladies have a wade boggs.

10:54.321 --> 10:55.253
And...
Why are we doing this?

10:55.255 --> 10:59.424
This way, we won't
be talking about
anything horrible.

10:59.426 --> 11:02.460
We're just gonna be
talking about baseball...

11:02.462 --> 11:04.529
Like,
when a man loves a woman,

11:04.531 --> 11:07.932
Mike schmidt
steps up to the plate
against wade boggs.

11:07.934 --> 11:10.001
Wade boggs plays third.
Why is he pitching?

11:10.003 --> 11:12.837
Fine! Wade boggs
is now steve carlton.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.906
Steve? That's clearly
a dude's name.

11:14.908 --> 11:19.110
Okay, the girl's parts
are gonna be, uh, bo jackson.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.445
That makes no sense.

11:20.447 --> 11:21.479
Bo's a girl's name!

11:21.481 --> 11:22.714
It's wintertime.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.649
That's when bo jackson
plays football.

11:24.651 --> 11:26.618
He'd never be
on the same field
as mike schmidt.

11:26.620 --> 11:30.055
I never thought that I would
ever say this to you,

11:30.057 --> 11:32.691
But you're over-thinking this,
you moron.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.225
I'm a moron?

11:34.227 --> 11:35.393
Well,
you're a mike schmidt!

11:35.395 --> 11:37.095
Take that back!
Never!

11:37.097 --> 11:39.297
Get your head
out of your orel hershiser

11:39.299 --> 11:41.766
And come back here
right now!

11:41.768 --> 11:44.436
(crunching)

11:44.438 --> 11:45.103
For what it's worth,

11:45.105 --> 11:48.506
I found that whole baseball
thing very confusing.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.575
That bad, huh?
It was bad.

11:50.577 --> 11:52.177
What kind of
16-year-old boy

11:52.179 --> 11:54.813
Doesn't even know
the basics of the birds
and the bees?

11:54.815 --> 11:56.147
Murray,
he knows everything.

11:56.149 --> 12:00.251
I gave him the talk
three years ago when
you dropped the ball.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.754
He's just messing
with you.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.789
So he wants a sex talk,
huh?

12:04.791 --> 12:08.493
Well, I'm gonna give him
a sex talk, but good.

12:08.495 --> 12:11.596
Or, instead of
trying to spite him,

12:11.598 --> 12:14.799
You actually have
a real conversation about it,

12:14.801 --> 12:17.402
Which would mean
the world to him.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.003
No, I'm gonna
go with my thing.

12:19.005 --> 12:22.140
Adult adam:
<i>As my dad was putting</i>
<i>his plan into motion,</i>

12:22.142 --> 12:25.310
<i>I was praying erica was,</i>
<i>as well.</i>

12:26.011 --> 12:27.078
Oh, balls.

12:27.080 --> 12:30.281
Hey, boopie.
Look what mama bought.

12:30.283 --> 12:31.950
Now we're parachute pals.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.952
No! That's not a thing.
Take 'em off.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.854
I paid for the pants.
Don't wear the pants.

12:35.856 --> 12:38.757
I'm wearing the pants.
Don't wear the pants.

12:38.759 --> 12:39.591
Hey, mom?

12:39.593 --> 12:40.291
Oh, look, it's erica.

12:40.293 --> 12:43.628
Check out this box of
old photos that I found
in the basement.

12:43.630 --> 12:44.729
Man, such good memories.

12:44.731 --> 12:48.566
We should, like,
organize these in
some sort of way.

12:48.568 --> 12:50.435
Maybe in, like, a book?

12:50.437 --> 12:51.703
That would be fun.

12:51.705 --> 12:53.505
Holy (bleep) erica.

12:53.507 --> 12:54.539
I have been begging you

12:54.541 --> 12:56.674
To make a scrapbook
with me for years!

12:56.676 --> 12:58.643
Well, let's make it
right now.
Oh, now?

12:58.645 --> 13:01.546
God, no.
I've got to chaperone
adam's dance tonight.

13:01.548 --> 13:04.916
Tomorrow morning,
we'll wake up at dawn
and really hit it hard.

13:04.918 --> 13:05.850
What do you say?

13:05.852 --> 13:08.486
Eh...
I'm kind of losing interest.

13:08.488 --> 13:11.256
Oh, no, no.
Don't lose interest.

13:11.258 --> 13:13.324
Um... I can do both.

13:13.326 --> 13:15.160
Adam, I'll meet you
at the dance.

13:15.162 --> 13:15.794
Erica, don't move.

13:15.796 --> 13:19.631
I'm just gonna
run upstairs and get
my smock and glue gun.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.201
There's 1,000 pictures
in this box.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.436
There's no way she's gonna
make it to that dance.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.605
Have I mentioned
that I love you?

13:27.607 --> 13:30.241
Say it one more time,
and I won't help you.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.010
Adult adam:  <i>Erica had</i>
<i>actually pulled it off.</i>

13:32.012 --> 13:35.013
<i>My mom was gonna be</i>
<i>stuck home all night!</i>

13:35.015 --> 13:36.614
All right,
got our cocoa.

13:36.616 --> 13:39.050
Let's cozy up
and spend the next few hours

13:39.052 --> 13:41.820
Reliving
my entire life.

13:41.954 --> 13:44.522
And...Done!

13:44.524 --> 13:46.825
What?
How did you do this?

13:46.827 --> 13:48.092
Please, I've had
this whole thing

13:48.094 --> 13:50.228
Mapped out in my mind
for years.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.597
You pressed flowers...

13:52.599 --> 13:56.234
And put
my favorite music lyrics
beneath each photo.

13:56.236 --> 13:59.037
Take some time with it.
(chuckles)

13:59.039 --> 14:01.406
It's like a beautiful
kaleidoscope of my life.

14:01.408 --> 14:02.774
(chuckles)
yeah, touching stuff.

14:02.776 --> 14:04.676
Now, I've got to get
to that dance.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.578
The jam's not gonna
pump itself up. (chuckles)

14:06.580 --> 14:08.479
Adult adam:  <i>While erica's</i>
<i>plan had failed,</i>

14:08.481 --> 14:11.182
<i>My dad was giving his</i>
<i>one more shot.</i>

14:11.184 --> 14:13.751
Hey, uh, bar,
you got a sec?

14:13.753 --> 14:18.423
I think we should have a talk,
man to man.

14:18.425 --> 14:20.258
Really? Okay.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.560
I've never been
a great communicator,

14:22.562 --> 14:27.699
So I think I should
keep things as direct
and exact as possible.

14:27.701 --> 14:31.603
All right.
So, we're not just gonna
have the talk.

14:31.605 --> 14:33.872
We're gonna
experience the talk.

14:33.874 --> 14:35.240
We're gonna do
some role-playing.

14:35.242 --> 14:37.175
I'm gonna be the girl.
You'll be the boy.

14:37.177 --> 14:40.812
And we're gonna learn
where babies come from
with our hands.

14:40.814 --> 14:42.680
Take a fraggle.
I don't want the fraggle.

14:42.682 --> 14:44.482
(high-pitched voice)
I'm a pretty fraggle girl.

14:44.484 --> 14:47.418
Would you like to come up
to my condo for a nightcap?

14:47.420 --> 14:52.891
I've been so lonely
since I put myself
through nursing school.

14:52.893 --> 14:54.192
Fraggles don't own condos!

14:54.194 --> 14:56.895
Take it.
Put your hand in the fraggle.

14:56.897 --> 14:58.730
Keep the fraggle
away from me!

14:58.732 --> 15:02.467
Take it now!
Stop it!
I was messing with you!

15:02.469 --> 15:03.635
I know everything, okay?

15:03.637 --> 15:05.236
I know
you know everything.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.138
Then why
are you torturing me?

15:07.140 --> 15:08.740
Because you tortured me!

15:08.742 --> 15:10.375
What kind of moron
makes their dad

15:10.377 --> 15:12.977
Give them the talk
when they don't need the talk?

15:12.979 --> 15:14.979
Who does that?
Me.

15:14.981 --> 15:16.481
And you know why?

15:16.483 --> 15:17.515
'cause you couldn't
be bothered

15:17.517 --> 15:19.651
To have the talk
when I actually needed it.

15:19.653 --> 15:21.853
Dads are supposed
to teach their kids stuff...

15:21.855 --> 15:26.724
How to throw a fastball
and change a tire and shave.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.092
You never
taught me anything.

15:28.094 --> 15:30.795
In my defense,
I know very little.

15:30.797 --> 15:34.565
And fraggles,
they can't be nurses.

15:34.567 --> 15:37.135
They dance
their cares away.

15:37.536 --> 15:39.337
Adult adam:  <i>As my dad</i>
<i>was striking out at home,</i>

15:39.339 --> 15:41.806
<i>I was ready to hit</i>
<i>the dance floor at school.</i>

15:41.808 --> 15:45.076
<i>The only problem was</i>
<i>that at a junior-high dance,</i>

15:45.078 --> 15:47.612
<i>Kids don't dance,</i>
<i>but that didn't matter.</i>

15:47.614 --> 15:49.614
<i>With my mom distracted</i>
<i>by erica at home,</i>

15:49.616 --> 15:54.819
<i>It was time for me</i>
<i>to show dana</i>
<i>my awesome moves.</i>

15:54.821 --> 15:57.088
May I have this dance?
(laughs)

15:57.090 --> 15:59.157
Kidding, I'm just
here to chaperone.

15:59.159 --> 16:01.092
Unless you're bored.
Then let's boogie.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.361
(gasps)
what are you doing here?

16:03.363 --> 16:04.329
I told you I'd make it.

16:04.331 --> 16:05.930
Now I'm gonna
need you to leave.

16:05.932 --> 16:06.664
Will you stop with that?

16:06.666 --> 16:09.367
I really want to be here
at this dance.

16:09.369 --> 16:12.103
You can't deny me
that pleasure, adam.

16:12.105 --> 16:12.904
Go away!

16:12.906 --> 16:17.008
But you're the one
who asked me to
teach you how to dance.

16:17.010 --> 16:17.775
It was a mistake.

16:17.777 --> 16:20.111
I asked for your help
in a moment of weakness.

16:20.113 --> 16:21.879
It'll never happen again.

16:22.081 --> 16:25.783
Okay. I guess
I'll just go then.

16:25.785 --> 16:26.718
(swishing)

16:26.720 --> 16:30.455
Adult adam:
<i>The sound of those swishing</i>
<i>parachute pants running away</i>

16:30.457 --> 16:31.823
<i>Was the sound of victory.</i>

16:31.825 --> 16:34.892
<i>So, then,</i>
<i>why did I feel so bad?</i>

16:36.395 --> 16:40.031
<i>Even though I was forced</i>
<i>to hurt my mom</i>
<i>in the name of love,</i>

16:40.033 --> 16:41.165
<i>I had to forge on.</i>

16:41.167 --> 16:43.835
<i>I'd charm dana</i>
<i>with a cup of hawaiian punch</i>

16:43.837 --> 16:45.536
<i>And then make my move.</i>

16:45.538 --> 16:46.804
Dana.
(panting) hey.

16:46.806 --> 16:48.506
Want some punch?
No, I'm just gonna go

16:48.508 --> 16:52.010
Hang outside until my mom
dances herself out.

16:52.012 --> 16:54.078
I didn't know
your mom was a chaperone.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.713
Yeah, and she went out
for margaritas

16:55.715 --> 16:57.582
With the other moms
before the dance.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.951
It's so humiliating.

17:00.419 --> 17:03.021
Adult adam:  <i>Turns out,</i>
<i>my mom was right</i>
<i>about one thing...</i>

17:03.023 --> 17:06.057
<i>Every kid is embarrassed</i>
<i>by their parents.</i>
<i>Mom!</i>

17:06.059 --> 17:08.159
<i>And it gave me an idea.</i>
<i>Mom!</i>

17:08.161 --> 17:10.895
Don't worry.
I'm just leaving.

17:10.897 --> 17:12.764
No. I need your help.

17:12.766 --> 17:14.232
Oh, no.
You don't get my help.

17:14.234 --> 17:17.068
Not after you said
you're never gonna
ask for it again.

17:17.070 --> 17:18.636
That's not how this works.

17:18.638 --> 17:19.670
I'm sorry, okay?

17:19.672 --> 17:21.672
Sometimes,
I need your help.

17:21.674 --> 17:25.443
But sometimes,
I just want you gone.

17:25.445 --> 17:26.711
Well, that's confusing!

17:26.713 --> 17:28.813
I know.
It makes no sense.

17:28.815 --> 17:31.883
But for now,
that's just how it's gonna be.

17:31.885 --> 17:32.717
So, what do you want?

17:32.719 --> 17:34.886
I want you to go
on that dance floor

17:34.888 --> 17:38.056
And just be yourself.

17:39.158 --> 17:40.124
I can do that.

17:40.126 --> 17:41.626
<i>♪ we can dance if we want to</i>

17:41.628 --> 17:44.028

17:58.678 --> 18:01.045
No one's looking
at your mom anymore.

18:01.047 --> 18:01.913
Did you do that for me?

18:01.915 --> 18:05.183
Well, I definitely
didn't do it for me.

18:13.460 --> 18:16.294

18:36.548 --> 18:37.815
Come on!
I like the fast ones!

18:37.817 --> 18:40.618
You know what?
I'm gonna go out
and get some fresh air.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.420
Why don't you come with me?

18:42.821 --> 18:43.354
Have fun, baby.

18:43.356 --> 18:47.558
Adult adam:
<i>Normally, we don't say</i>
<i>"I love you" in our family.</i>

19:05.278 --> 19:06.644
Want some company?

19:06.646 --> 19:08.579
I am a terrible father.

19:08.581 --> 19:10.882
I'll take that as a yes.

19:10.949 --> 19:11.549
(sighs)

19:11.551 --> 19:13.684
I don't even know
how to talk to my kids.

19:13.686 --> 19:14.418
I'm aware.

19:14.420 --> 19:16.120
I always thought
that I would do

19:16.122 --> 19:18.556
Everything different
than my dad did.

19:18.558 --> 19:20.258
And look at me,
I'm just like him.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.093
Murray,
you're nothing like him.

19:22.095 --> 19:24.028
What are you talking about?

19:24.030 --> 19:25.396
We both look alike.

19:25.398 --> 19:26.931
We both
scream all the time.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.599
We both walk around
in our underwear.

19:28.601 --> 19:34.605
But your dad would never
be out here right now,
feeling like this.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.574
And that's
why you're different.

19:36.576 --> 19:42.480
Adult adam:
<i>As for my dad, he'd never be</i>
<i>a good communicator.</i>

19:43.615 --> 19:44.715
Damn it!

19:44.717 --> 19:45.917
Has anyone
seen the bottle opener?

19:45.919 --> 19:49.387
Adult adam:
<i>But he was still able to</i>
<i>teach you a few things.</i>

19:49.988 --> 19:53.224
Here.
Let me show you something.

19:54.026 --> 19:54.559
Ooh.

19:54.561 --> 19:58.563
Little party trick.
The ladies love it.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.431
Not bad.

20:00.433 --> 20:01.165
Don't just stand there.

20:01.167 --> 20:03.901
Go get another one,
and I'll show you how.

20:05.537 --> 20:08.072
Adult adam:  <i>That night,</i>
<i>I learned that some events</i>

20:08.074 --> 20:11.342
<i>Can't be captured</i>

20:13.412 --> 20:17.114
<i>You just got to be there</i>

20:18.650 --> 20:22.520
<i>♪ then I touched your hand</i>

20:48.914 --> 20:50.414
Mrs. Goldberg.

20:51.350 --> 20:53.017
Mrs. Goldberg!

20:53.019 --> 20:54.185
It's time to go home.

20:54.187 --> 20:56.020
Mmm, dances don't really end,

20:56.022 --> 20:57.521
And the invitation
for this one said,

20:57.523 --> 20:59.991
"6:00 to question mark,"
so...

20:59.993 --> 21:01.626
That was a nine.

21:03.228 --> 21:04.695
(sighs)

21:14.072 --> 21:17.008
(music stops)

21:17.175 --> 21:19.443
Okay, well,
that was just rude.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.653
(bell dings)
