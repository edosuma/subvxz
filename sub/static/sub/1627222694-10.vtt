[dog barking]

00:12.178 --> 00:13.680
[Sarah and John B panting]

00:19.352 --> 00:22.272
-[Sarah] We can hide in here.
-[John B] You sure this place is empty?

00:22.355 --> 00:24.482
[Sarah] Yeah, it's Rose's listing.

00:24.566 --> 00:26.568
[sirens continue wailing]

00:32.115 --> 00:34.325
Zero, two, one, five.

00:35.869 --> 00:36.953
My dad's birthday.

00:37.954 --> 00:40.331
[officer 1] Let's check this street.
They can't be far.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.000
-[Sarah] Shit.
-[man yelling]

00:42.584 --> 00:44.002
-[Sarah] Come on.
-[John B] Go.

00:46.004 --> 00:47.088
[officer 1] Nothin' here.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.049
Check the porch.

00:50.341 --> 00:52.302
-I got this one. You go check next door.
-Sh.

00:52.385 --> 00:53.803
[officer 2] Okay, will do.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.639
-[officer 1] I'll go around back.
-[knocking]

01:00.518 --> 01:01.895
-[officer 2] All right...
-[sighs]

01:01.978 --> 01:04.147
[officer 1] He's probably headed
over to the cut.

01:04.272 --> 01:07.317
-Let's go.
-Let's go. Come on. Let's go upstairs.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.613
[Rafe] Hurry up! This way!

01:14.074 --> 01:16.034
I can't believe that's my brother.

01:16.451 --> 01:19.120
-[Rafe] They're headed to the cut.
-[Kelce] Let's go down Banks Road.

01:22.499 --> 01:23.833
[exhales]

01:25.293 --> 01:26.753
[both sigh]

01:29.255 --> 01:30.173
[John B] Wow.

01:30.256 --> 01:32.175
-[Sarah] Sweet, right?
-[John B] Yeah.

01:33.426 --> 01:37.055
Hey, did you know the, uh...
the bottom two stars in the Little Dipper

01:37.138 --> 01:38.890
-point to the North--
-[Sarah] The North Star?

01:41.059 --> 01:41.976
Yeah.

01:43.353 --> 01:44.604
That's the center point.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.357
What everything else spins around.

01:49.609 --> 01:51.152
-[dog barking]
-[man] Hey, you headed--

01:51.236 --> 01:52.570
-[gasping]
-[Sarah] Sh, sh, sh.

01:52.654 --> 01:53.988
It's okay. It's okay.

01:55.573 --> 01:56.407
It's okay.

01:57.283 --> 01:58.618
It's okay. I've got you.

02:01.955 --> 02:06.000
[sighs]
Could you remind me of the happy ending?

02:06.584 --> 02:07.418
Yeah.

02:08.503 --> 02:10.588
We're gonna meet the crew
at the dock tomorrow.

02:10.672 --> 02:11.548
Yeah.

02:12.215 --> 02:13.883
Then they're gonna have the getaway boat.

02:14.425 --> 02:16.177
-Then we go to Mexico.
-Yeah.

02:16.594 --> 02:18.680
And you're gonna be a fishing instructor.

02:19.264 --> 02:20.348
You're damn right.

02:20.431 --> 02:22.600
And I'm gonna have a sandwich shop.

02:24.018 --> 02:27.188
And we're gonna have
a house on a beach...

02:28.356 --> 02:30.733
and a dog and a boat.

02:31.609 --> 02:32.902
We'll remake the <i>Pogue.</i>

02:35.113 --> 02:36.781
And everything's gonna be okay.

02:45.707 --> 02:47.709
[shouting outside]

02:51.588 --> 02:53.590
[siren wailing]

03:00.513 --> 03:02.724
-[groans, sighs]
-[clicking]

03:08.521 --> 03:09.939
-[sirens continue]
-[clicking]

03:13.568 --> 03:14.986
He's pinched for sure, man.

03:16.571 --> 03:19.199
No. They wouldn't still be patrolling
if they caught him.

03:19.282 --> 03:20.200
Let's hope.

03:20.283 --> 03:23.870
You know, we were in that car.
They're probably looking for us, too.

03:27.749 --> 03:30.335
Well, if we're gonna be outlaws,
we might as well help John B.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.297
So, find him before they do?

03:34.923 --> 03:36.883
-Pope?
-[Pope] I'm gonna get gas for the boat.

03:36.966 --> 03:38.301
[Kie] Hey, you be careful.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.136
Okay?

03:42.889 --> 03:45.058
Meet me at the dock at three.
Don't be late.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.353
[door closes]

03:50.563 --> 03:52.357
[Kie] Okay, what is your problem?

03:52.440 --> 03:54.609
No problem, Officer.
I'm just doing my job.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.488
[Kie] Look, I'm sorry
that I hurt your feelings.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.573
[revving engine]

04:00.657 --> 04:02.742
-What was that?
-Look, I didn't mean to.

04:02.825 --> 04:04.452
Sorry, I can't hear you. What was that?

04:04.535 --> 04:06.913
-Pope, I'm being serious--
-[revving engine]

04:06.996 --> 04:08.456
I'm trying to talk to you!

04:18.841 --> 04:20.843
[helicopter blades whirring]

04:25.932 --> 04:26.891
[JJ] Who is that?

04:30.770 --> 04:32.772
[thunder rumbling]

04:40.280 --> 04:42.490
-[pilot] Watch your head. Rotor's hot.
-Thanks.

04:43.783 --> 04:45.576
[officer 1] Officer,
this is Agent Williams...

04:45.660 --> 04:48.913
-[officer 2] Nice to meet you.
-[officer 3] How you doing? I'm Deputy...

04:49.580 --> 04:51.124
-How we doing?
-[agent] Good.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.626
Special Agent Bratcher. SBI.

04:54.252 --> 04:55.712
Sorry to hear about Sheriff Peterkin.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.880
Yeah. Thank you. She was a special lady.

04:58.673 --> 05:00.883
I'm Sheriff Victor Shoupe.
Deputy Plumb.

05:00.967 --> 05:01.884
[Plumb] Hi.

05:02.552 --> 05:05.680
Look, I just wanted to let you know,
we're not here to step on any local toes,

05:05.763 --> 05:07.348
but from my reading of the situation,

05:07.432 --> 05:09.100
we have a homicidal individual
on the loose,

05:09.183 --> 05:11.728
and the entire island population
is at risk until he's apprehended.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.314
We'll set up a marine cordon
for containment.

05:14.397 --> 05:17.692
We start from the top down,
we move systematically block by block.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.986
-[Shoupe] Let's do it.
-[officer 2] Move!

05:25.283 --> 05:28.411
All I know is John B is gonna get caught.
They're gonna find him,

05:28.494 --> 05:30.705
-and he'll tell them everything.
-Okay. They catch him,

05:30.788 --> 05:32.206
it's your word against his.

05:32.290 --> 05:33.124
[Ward muttering]

05:33.207 --> 05:35.710
-[Rose] Yes, it is!
-What about the ex-cons I took care of?

05:35.793 --> 05:37.795
-Who tried to blackmail and assault you?
-[Ward] Yes.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.630
-Well, they're not talking to anybody.
-Okay.

05:39.714 --> 05:42.175
Besides,
it's not a crime to defend yourself.

05:42.258 --> 05:46.429
[sighs] What I did to them,
that was a crime, believe me.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.348
-There are just too many loose threads.
-Okay--

05:48.431 --> 05:50.975
Sarah's out there. For all I know,
she's at the police station now.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.643
If Sarah was talking to the police,

05:52.727 --> 05:54.437
don't you think
they would be here right now?

05:54.520 --> 05:55.563
-Okay.
-[Rose] It's fine.

05:55.646 --> 05:58.483
What you don't understand is this--
All of this is my fault.

05:58.566 --> 06:00.985
-Rafe is falling apart, okay?
-[Rose] Yeah, I know.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.154
-What he did was because of me.
-[Rose] No.

06:03.654 --> 06:05.031
Ward, no. Look at me.

06:05.114 --> 06:07.033
You do not bear responsibility

06:07.116 --> 06:08.618
-for what Rafe did.
-God damn it, Rose.

06:08.701 --> 06:09.994
I bear responsibility...

06:10.078 --> 06:11.704
-[Rose] No.
-...for all of it.

06:15.583 --> 06:17.168
And I don't know how to fix it.

06:18.544 --> 06:19.587
I'm out of moves.

06:20.171 --> 06:23.841
Okay, then we just gotta go.
Come on. We can go to the Caribbean.

06:23.925 --> 06:26.094
We can go to the Bahamas.
The gold is there. Let's go.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.763
We can go to Nassau.
We'll get out. Yes, we have to.

06:28.846 --> 06:30.765
-I cannot. I can't run right now!
-Let's go!

06:30.848 --> 06:33.518
It looks like I'm guilty.
And I cannot leave without Sarah.

06:33.601 --> 06:36.396
I'm not leaving
without my little girl, okay? I won't.

06:37.772 --> 06:38.856
No, that's it, Ward.

06:39.399 --> 06:43.569
Oh, my God. No. You're...
you're the concerned father, right?

06:44.612 --> 06:47.031
-I'm the worried father.
-[Rose] Yeah. Your daughter's missing.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.699
She's out with a fugitive, and she...

06:49.617 --> 06:53.663
-What do I say if they ask questions?
-All you know is your daughter is missing,

06:53.746 --> 06:54.914
and you have to get her back.

06:56.457 --> 06:57.333
Sell.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.129
Baby, it's what you do. Just sell.

07:06.801 --> 07:07.802
I'll be back.

07:13.558 --> 07:14.851
[Rafe] I'll <i>mess you up, man.</i>

07:14.934 --> 07:16.144
<i>You know, I said I'd do it.</i>

07:16.227 --> 07:18.438
I said-- Didn't I say I would? Huh?

07:18.521 --> 07:19.605
<i>I said I'd mess you up.</i>

07:19.689 --> 07:20.606
I warned you.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.400
Okay.

07:22.483 --> 07:23.860
Goddamn. Come on.

07:23.943 --> 07:25.611
[gasps and laughs]

07:25.695 --> 07:27.780
Listen. Hey, listen.
I take care of business.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.490
Okay? Every day I do that.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.117
<i>It's all right, all right?</i>

07:31.200 --> 07:32.160
It's all right.

07:32.243 --> 07:34.245
[breathing heavily]

07:35.163 --> 07:36.247
Yeah, it's all right.

07:41.419 --> 07:42.420
Oh, my God.

07:51.762 --> 07:53.181
[revs engine]

08:03.399 --> 08:04.567
[sighs]

08:32.428 --> 08:34.430
[man on radio] <i>...any information...</i>

08:45.441 --> 08:47.109
[woman 1] Look, Captain, how about...

08:47.193 --> 08:48.945
[woman 2]
I'll let 'em know at the station...

08:49.028 --> 08:51.155
-[man] Yes?
-[woman 2] Get a shot of the whole...

08:51.239 --> 08:53.741
[man] At this time,
I have no information to give you.

08:53.824 --> 08:56.202
[indistinct chatter]

08:56.285 --> 08:57.286
[Bratcher] Listen up.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.248
We have a blanket warrant
on all residences assumed to be empty.

09:00.748 --> 09:03.251
We have checkpoints on the bridges
to limit mobility.

09:03.334 --> 09:05.378
Coast guard has eyes on the water.

09:05.461 --> 09:06.671
We have some weather coming in,

09:06.754 --> 09:09.090
but we've asked our nautical units
to remain in position

09:09.173 --> 09:11.551
while we conduct our search of the island.

09:11.634 --> 09:15.721
Suspect is a 16-year-old white male,
possibly armed.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.932
Last seen
in the southwest quadrant of the island.

09:18.015 --> 09:19.892
-[woman 3] Check on your...
-[woman 4] Yes.

09:21.769 --> 09:23.020
-Hey, ma'am.
-[Sarah] Excuse me.

09:23.104 --> 09:25.773
-Only authorized personnel at this point.
-Is this all for John B?

09:25.856 --> 09:27.441
[officer]
Orders are for locals to shelter

09:27.525 --> 09:29.110
and report sightings
to law enforcement.

09:29.193 --> 09:32.488
He's not armed. I promise, he's not armed,
and he's not dangerous.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.115
-We'll take a statement.
-I just want--

09:34.198 --> 09:36.659
-I want to talk to someone in charge.
-[officer] Wait. We're--

09:36.742 --> 09:38.077
You're going after the wrong guy!

09:38.160 --> 09:40.913
-[officer] Relax! Ma'am, relax.
-[Sarah] I just want to talk to someone.

09:40.997 --> 09:42.623
-[officer] Come with me.
-[Sarah] No.

09:42.707 --> 09:45.668
-No, you don't understand. Let go of me!
-[officer] You need to calm down.

09:45.751 --> 09:47.587
-Excuse me! SBI guy!
-[officer] Ma'am!

09:47.670 --> 09:50.339
-Hi, my name is Sarah Cameron.
-[officer] Sorry. She won't stop.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.843
I was on the tarmac with Sheriff Peterkin.
I know what happened.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.261
-I was there!
-Relax.

09:55.344 --> 09:56.887
[Sarah] Please, I just want to talk!

09:56.971 --> 09:59.181
-Please!
-[officer] All right, all right. Sir.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.516
-[Sarah] Thank you.
-It's fine.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.685
-How can I help you, ma'am?
-I'm sorry.

10:02.768 --> 10:03.853
There you are!

10:03.936 --> 10:06.272
Oh, my God. I've been looking everywhere
for you, sweetheart.

10:06.355 --> 10:08.399
-No, no.
-We gotta let these people do their jobs.

10:08.482 --> 10:09.692
-I'm very sorry.
-No.

10:09.775 --> 10:11.444
-John B didn't shoot Peterkin!
-Sarah!

10:11.527 --> 10:14.905
I can tell you that is not true.
I gave a sworn deposition.

10:14.989 --> 10:17.116
-She wasn't there. She doesn't know.
-No.

10:17.199 --> 10:18.576
-No! That's a lie!
-[Ward] Please.

10:18.659 --> 10:20.953
-[Sarah] Everything he's saying is a lie!
-[Ward] Fine!

10:22.496 --> 10:23.372
Fine.

10:25.082 --> 10:27.043
Who did it, then, Sarah?

10:31.672 --> 10:33.090
Who killed Sheriff Peterkin?

10:37.928 --> 10:39.472
[sobs]

10:40.765 --> 10:41.599
Rafe.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.102
-Rafe.
-Jesus. God.

10:45.519 --> 10:47.146
My brother Rafe shot Sheriff Peterkin.

10:47.229 --> 10:48.898
-I saw. He had the gun.
-[Ward] He was home.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.192
-My wife can attest to that. I apologize.
-No!

10:51.275 --> 10:53.361
-No! No!
-Please, sweetie. Quiet. Stop.

10:53.444 --> 10:55.112
What is wrong with you?

10:56.155 --> 10:58.616
[sobbing]
How long have you been lying to us?

10:59.992 --> 11:01.160
Who are you?

11:05.373 --> 11:07.333
Officer, can I have a moment in private
with you?

11:10.127 --> 11:12.463
Um... My officer's gonna take
really good care of you,

11:12.546 --> 11:13.673
-all right?
-No. No!

11:13.756 --> 11:15.800
-No, no, no. Don't go! Listen!
-I'll be right back.

11:15.883 --> 11:18.260
Everything he's saying is a lie! Liar!

11:18.344 --> 11:20.346
-Stop it.
-[Sarah] No! No!

11:21.013 --> 11:22.181
Let go of me!

11:22.640 --> 11:25.851
I appreciate this, Officer.
As you can see, this has been hell for us.

11:25.935 --> 11:28.562
-[officer] Ma'am.
-[Sarah] I just need to talk to someone.

11:28.646 --> 11:31.857
-[officer] Ma'am, pipe down.
-My daughter is falling apart right here.

11:32.358 --> 11:36.946
She was just diagnosed as bipolar,
and right now, she's in a relationship,

11:37.029 --> 11:39.323
a very unhealthy relationship,
with this...

11:40.866 --> 11:42.326
well, with your suspect.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.286
She is 16, and she's...

11:44.370 --> 11:46.038
-[Sarah] Let go of me!
-Protecting him.

11:46.122 --> 11:48.457
-Yes. Yes. Absolutely.
-[Sarah] Ow!

11:49.250 --> 11:50.084
Let me go!

11:50.167 --> 11:52.420
I can't even tell you the number
this guy has done on her.

11:52.503 --> 11:55.047
He has her so brainwashed,
she doesn't even see him for what he is,

11:55.131 --> 11:56.549
and that is a very bad guy.

11:56.632 --> 11:58.551
I know he uses drugs.

11:58.634 --> 12:02.221
He was involved
in an assault with a weapon, all right?

12:02.304 --> 12:04.849
More recently, I caught him trying
to steal one of my WaveRunners.

12:04.932 --> 12:06.183
I confronted him about it,

12:06.267 --> 12:09.687
and he physically attacked me
and stabbed me in my arm.

12:09.770 --> 12:11.856
And that was the assault
that Sheriff Peterkin

12:11.939 --> 12:13.816
came to the airport to discuss with me.

12:13.899 --> 12:18.362
And while we were talking,
he shows up... and he shoots her.

12:18.821 --> 12:20.072
[Sarah] No!

12:20.573 --> 12:22.241
-[officer] Hey! Hey!
-[Sarah] No!

12:22.324 --> 12:23.451
And it's breaking her.

12:23.534 --> 12:24.910
[officer] Ma'am, you have to stop.

12:24.994 --> 12:29.373
So, I guess what I'm asking here is
if maybe I can just take my daughter home

12:29.457 --> 12:32.710
and let her calm down
and let her get her medication and just...

12:34.462 --> 12:35.296
be safe.

12:36.672 --> 12:37.590
You know?

12:39.592 --> 12:41.343
-[Bratcher] Yeah.
-Thank you.

12:44.805 --> 12:46.557
I'm just gonna talk to her first.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.602
She may have some information
that can help us get this guy.

12:50.352 --> 12:51.395
You hang in there.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.774
[officer] Okay,
you're gonna have to sit tight, miss.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.405
[officer 2] Agent Bratcher!
Agent Bratcher!

13:01.489 --> 13:03.491
[crowd clamoring]

13:05.075 --> 13:06.368
[officer groaning]

13:06.452 --> 13:08.370
[officer 2] Shit, man. Man, you okay?

13:08.454 --> 13:10.206
I'm sorry, sir. She kneed me.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.336
You lost my daughter?

13:15.419 --> 13:16.337
I'm sorry.

13:16.420 --> 13:18.547
Let's get him a medic. With me.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.633
[motorcycle speeding]

13:25.846 --> 13:26.764
[door opens]

13:26.847 --> 13:27.932
[Rafe] Barry!

13:28.015 --> 13:29.767
[Barry snorting]

13:31.560 --> 13:32.728
I need cocaine.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.105
Well, I'm all out, man.
That was my last line right there.

13:35.189 --> 13:37.149
Everybody done came and done a run on me.

13:37.233 --> 13:40.861
-Everybody stockin' up for this storm.
-Oh, I know you got it in here, bro.

13:40.945 --> 13:43.697
[Barry] No, I don't got anything in here.
I'm all out, man.

13:43.781 --> 13:46.784
-Bullshit, man! You're full of shit.
-[Barry] People got to do something--

13:46.867 --> 13:49.203
Rafe! What did I say, bitch? I'm out!

13:49.662 --> 13:52.122
I'm out, bitch! Get out of here, man!
Get out of my room!

13:52.206 --> 13:54.750
[gasping] Where is it?
I know you got some.

13:54.834 --> 13:58.170
-[Barry] What the hell done got into you?
-Because I-- [sobbing]

13:58.629 --> 14:00.464
Some...

14:00.548 --> 14:02.383
Oh, shit, man.

14:03.968 --> 14:06.345
Hey. Hey, look, dog.

14:06.428 --> 14:08.639
-[crying]
-Hey, Rafe?

14:08.722 --> 14:10.432
-[sighs]
-You're good. You're good.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.017
You're good. You're good. Breathe.

14:13.853 --> 14:17.606
Have you ever, uh...
have you ever done something...

14:18.941 --> 14:20.568
that you never thought you would?

14:20.651 --> 14:22.611
Like, somethin'... somethin' bad?

14:23.195 --> 14:26.782
Uh, what you done, Country Club?
Was you late to a tee time? Huh?

14:27.867 --> 14:31.036
You can talk to me, man. Just--
just tell me whatever the hell you done,

14:31.120 --> 14:33.497
'cause I can promise you,
whatever it was, I done worse, bro.

14:33.581 --> 14:34.540
I was in the army.

14:37.877 --> 14:38.961
I did, uh...

14:40.421 --> 14:41.297
something.

14:43.549 --> 14:44.592
[sniffs]

14:45.134 --> 14:48.470
And now I'm--
I'm fucked, man, like, totally.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.097
Like, a hundred percent, I'm fucked.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.891
Like, for life, man. there's--

14:54.393 --> 14:56.061
There's no way out of this, bro.

14:56.145 --> 14:58.105
Don't be on my porch
sayin' there ain't no way out.

14:58.188 --> 15:00.274
I'mma tell you right now,
there's a way out, a'ight?

15:00.357 --> 15:02.026
What you need to do is you need to nut up.

15:02.860 --> 15:05.696
If you've got a problem,
only thing you can do is fix it.

15:06.238 --> 15:09.116
I got a problem right now.
I got a damn big problem right now.

15:09.199 --> 15:11.368
You see me in my damn room,
cryin' about that shit?

15:11.911 --> 15:14.288
[whining] No.

15:15.122 --> 15:17.708
-I was going to fix it when you pulled up.
-Help me.

15:17.791 --> 15:19.752
[Barry] Your sister
and all her little friends,

15:19.835 --> 15:21.253
they still got my cabbage.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.088
And you ain't brought it to me yet.

15:23.839 --> 15:25.132
I'm gonna get my money.

15:26.091 --> 15:28.010
And that hammer's comin' down
on them Pogues.

15:30.804 --> 15:34.141
You know it was John B
that stole that 25K from you, right?

15:34.224 --> 15:36.518
That's the point I'm talkin' about,
Country Club.

15:37.061 --> 15:40.814
See, how quick you think it's gonna take
for them to get a hold of John B, huh?

15:40.898 --> 15:45.027
And when they do,
he's gonna start snitchin'. Mm-hm.

15:45.486 --> 15:48.948
On me, on my operation,
about the robbery, all that shit.

15:49.031 --> 15:51.450
-It's gonna be a lose-lose for me, homey.
-Yeah.

15:51.533 --> 15:54.787
Unless I get to him first.

15:55.245 --> 15:57.623
I want that boy, and I want my money.

15:57.706 --> 15:59.416
So, what do you say we go get him?

16:04.338 --> 16:06.131
[siren blaring]

16:12.888 --> 16:13.847
Shit.

16:14.723 --> 16:15.933
[door opens]

16:16.934 --> 16:18.227
[door closes]

16:19.436 --> 16:21.188
[footsteps approaching]

16:24.858 --> 16:26.777
[breathing shakily]

16:30.656 --> 16:31.490
Sarah.

16:33.117 --> 16:35.077
Hey, where-- where have you been?

16:35.160 --> 16:36.412
-It's okay, it's okay.
-[sobbing]

16:36.495 --> 16:39.123
Hey. Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

16:39.581 --> 16:43.252
It's okay. I got you. I got you.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.964
It's getting really bad out there.

16:47.047 --> 16:48.465
-[siren whoops]
-[car door slams]

16:48.549 --> 16:49.383
Shit.

16:49.466 --> 16:50.968
-[radio chatter]
-[gasps] Shit.

16:55.639 --> 16:58.267
-We gotta go. Okay?
-[Sarah] Okay.

17:02.521 --> 17:04.273
[knocking on door]

17:04.356 --> 17:06.150
Kildare County Sheriff. Open up!

17:08.527 --> 17:10.446
[knocking]

17:10.529 --> 17:13.073
Kildare County Sheriff. Last warning!

17:16.577 --> 17:17.494
Let's do this.

17:28.213 --> 17:29.048
Clear.

17:49.777 --> 17:51.195
[siren wailing]

17:58.577 --> 18:00.079
[siren continues wailing]

18:08.253 --> 18:09.630
[brakes screech]

18:25.646 --> 18:28.148
[sirens wailing in distance]

18:28.232 --> 18:30.234
[thunder rumbles]

18:36.990 --> 18:38.158
[sighs]

18:40.536 --> 18:41.578
Look at you.

18:41.662 --> 18:44.706
Like some damn street hood out here
stealing gas from me.

18:45.124 --> 18:45.999
My own blood.

18:46.083 --> 18:49.211
-I'm not stealing.
-Stop lyin'. I saw it in your damn hand.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.923
My friend is in trouble,
and I need to help him.

18:53.674 --> 18:55.926
-John B did not kill anybody.
-Says who?

18:56.009 --> 18:58.095
-Says me.
-[Heyward] I'm supposed to believe you?

18:58.679 --> 19:00.514
After you ran out on your interview?

19:01.098 --> 19:02.349
Shit, boy, get in the house.

19:02.432 --> 19:03.267
No.

19:04.518 --> 19:05.936
Oh, you a man now? Huh?

19:06.770 --> 19:08.939
You wanna have a go at it with me?
Is that it?

19:10.357 --> 19:12.609
I'm taking these cans.
You not gettin' in my way.

19:12.693 --> 19:13.819
Oh, I'm gettin' in your way.

19:13.902 --> 19:17.197
And one day,
you might be able to whoop my ass,

19:17.281 --> 19:18.448
but it ain't today.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.452
-[Pope] That right?
-[Heyward] Yeah.

19:23.370 --> 19:25.831
Oh, yeah! It's gonna take a little more
than that. Try again.

19:26.957 --> 19:28.917
Come on. You wanna hit your daddy?

19:30.127 --> 19:32.171
Try again. Hm?

19:33.255 --> 19:34.214
You want to hit me?

19:35.174 --> 19:37.217
I don't got time for this.
I gotta help my friend.

19:38.010 --> 19:42.264
Yeah, yeah, you just go ahead.
Yeah, you take everything, son.

19:43.432 --> 19:44.808
You already have!

19:46.059 --> 19:48.228
You're an ungrateful son of a bitch, Pope.

19:49.938 --> 19:52.065
You sure he wasn't just being weird Pope?

19:52.149 --> 19:55.068
It wasn't really the kind of thing
that needed interpretation.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.070
Is that enough food for them?

19:57.154 --> 20:00.032
I mean, for a couple of weeks,
and that's all they need, so...

20:00.824 --> 20:03.076
Look, I think
I actually hurt his feelings.

20:03.160 --> 20:06.413
Look, don't beat yourself up too much.
He's completely changed his feels.

20:06.496 --> 20:08.957
The past 24 hours
have been like Jekyll and Hyde.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.376
I hate to admit it,
but I miss the old Pope.

20:11.668 --> 20:14.213
-At least I knew what to expect from him.
-Where you been?

20:15.047 --> 20:16.548
Uh-- I'm fine. I slept here.

20:16.632 --> 20:19.885
Well, we were up half the night,
scared to death, lookin' for you.

20:19.968 --> 20:22.971
-Were you even gonna tell us?
-Well, I'm telling you right now.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.766
-What the hell are you two up to?
-I'm sorry, Miss Anna, we gotta go.

20:25.849 --> 20:27.392
-Sorry.
-No. I'm sorry. Absolutely not.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.686
-Have you heard what's going on?
-Mom, I'll explain later.

20:29.770 --> 20:31.313
[Anna] Have you seen the storm?

20:31.396 --> 20:33.523
-This is not safe.
-I'm sorry, Mom. I have to go!

20:33.607 --> 20:34.691
These cops are armed, Kiara.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.026
-You'll get shot.
-I have to go!

20:36.109 --> 20:38.445
-[Anna] I am not letting you do this!
-Mom, John B needs me!

20:38.528 --> 20:41.198
-[Anna] You need to stay here.
-[Kie] I understand. I'll be careful.

20:41.281 --> 20:42.532
-Sorry!
-Kiara! Open this door!

20:42.616 --> 20:43.825
-I'm sorry.
-Stop it right now.

20:43.909 --> 20:46.578
Right now, Kiara! This is not safe! Stop!

20:46.662 --> 20:47.996
Stop! Kiara!

20:52.542 --> 20:54.253
-[John B] You okay?
-[Sarah] Yeah, I'm fine.

20:54.336 --> 20:55.796
Okay. I'm fine.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.342
Do you really think
they'll be able to steal the boat?

21:01.343 --> 21:02.970
Well, JJ's involved, so...

21:04.054 --> 21:06.223
-yeah. [chuckles]
-[sirens wailing]

21:07.891 --> 21:08.892
Shit.

21:13.647 --> 21:16.608
[Sarah] John B, where are you going?
The boat ramp's this way.

21:17.609 --> 21:21.238
Look, Sarah, I've gotta go home.

21:21.655 --> 21:22.489
What?

21:23.073 --> 21:25.284
No. There'll be cops
crawling all over there.

21:25.701 --> 21:26.952
Yeah, and that's okay.

21:27.869 --> 21:30.872
-Look, I-- I don't want you to come. It--
-What do you mean?

21:30.956 --> 21:33.917
The gold from Crain's house.
It's at the Château.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.753
My dad's been looking for that for years.

21:36.837 --> 21:38.547
It's all I have left of him.
I gotta get it.

21:38.630 --> 21:40.632
-And we're gonna need the money.
-You'll get caught.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.884
-Okay, then I get caught.
-Then all this is for nothing.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.761
[John B] No, it's not.
Listen to me, please.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.139
I need you to go to the boat dock
in an hour.

21:47.222 --> 21:48.682
-No, I'm coming with you.
-You're not.

21:48.765 --> 21:50.517
-Yes, I am.
-You're not coming with me!

21:50.600 --> 21:53.812
It's too dangerous. Go to the boat dock.
I'll see you in an hour.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.815
If we don't have money,
we can't go anywhere.

21:57.691 --> 21:58.775
We're losing time.

22:14.708 --> 22:16.835
[chickens clucking]

22:16.918 --> 22:17.919
Home sweet home.

22:20.547 --> 22:21.715
Do you want me to come?

22:22.174 --> 22:24.176
-'Cause I'll come.
-No.

22:24.593 --> 22:26.053
This will only take a second.

22:31.850 --> 22:32.893
[chuckles]

22:34.394 --> 22:35.729
[door opens]

22:37.272 --> 22:38.774
-[fly buzzing]
-Dad?

22:42.778 --> 22:44.071
[snoring]

22:48.909 --> 22:50.744
Dad, I need the keys to the <i>Phantom.</i>

22:53.455 --> 22:54.915
-[snoring]
-[JJ] Dad?

23:22.317 --> 23:23.735
[exhales]

23:35.122 --> 23:37.040
[Luke] I didn't expect to see you.

23:38.375 --> 23:39.209
You're back.

23:40.627 --> 23:42.587
-[sighs]
-Yeah, no, I just--

23:42.671 --> 23:44.548
-[Luke] Huh?
-[JJ] Just checkin' in.

23:44.714 --> 23:45.799
School out already?

23:47.384 --> 23:48.844
-What?
-[Luke] Did you ditch?

23:49.344 --> 23:51.596
[chuckles] It's all right.
You can tell me.

23:52.973 --> 23:53.807
Yeah.

23:54.224 --> 23:56.101
-I hit the break, you know.
-[giggles]

23:56.726 --> 23:59.062
I hated school too. My boy!

24:00.272 --> 24:01.231
Hey you know what...

24:01.648 --> 24:02.774
Listen, hey.

24:03.233 --> 24:08.196
Hey, look,
I know I'm hard on you sometimes.

24:08.613 --> 24:09.448
Mm.

24:09.865 --> 24:11.700
But sometimes, I see--
I see your mother in you,

24:11.783 --> 24:14.411
and it gets me a little tweaked, you know?

24:14.494 --> 24:15.370
[both laugh]

24:15.454 --> 24:16.997
-You're a good boy.
-Mm-hm.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.290
And I love you, son.

24:19.583 --> 24:20.959
Come here. I love you.

24:21.042 --> 24:22.127
I love you, son.

24:24.004 --> 24:25.630
I love you. [sighs]

24:27.799 --> 24:29.384
[JJ sniffling]

24:33.763 --> 24:34.890
Love you too, Dad.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.019
-I'm sorry.
-[Luke] Ain't got nothin' to be sorry for.

24:39.895 --> 24:41.104
[sighs]

24:41.938 --> 24:42.981
You're a good boy.

24:44.399 --> 24:45.817
[breathing shakily]

24:51.281 --> 24:52.866
[engine starts]

24:58.246 --> 24:59.122
How'd it go?

25:13.929 --> 25:16.806
-Hey, did you know his father?
-[Shoupe] Sure, I knew him.

25:17.140 --> 25:18.058
I liked him.

25:19.100 --> 25:21.811
-He was a good man.
-[Thomas] That's what I hear.

25:21.895 --> 25:23.230
Shame what happened to him.

25:23.313 --> 25:25.315
[man on radio] <i>Dispatch, this is...</i>

25:29.611 --> 25:31.613
[radio chatter continues]

25:46.169 --> 25:48.004
-[Thomas] Hey, Shoupe?
-Yeah.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.757
[Thomas] You're gonna wanna
take a look at this.

25:54.344 --> 25:55.220
[Shoupe] What you got?

25:58.515 --> 26:00.433
-Is that what I think it is?
-[thunder rumbling]

26:00.517 --> 26:01.393
[Thomas] Yeah.

26:04.479 --> 26:05.522
[Shoupe] Holy Jesus.

26:05.939 --> 26:08.358
Wouldn't wanna drop that on your foot.
[chuckles]

26:11.152 --> 26:12.320
What are you thinkin'?

26:12.404 --> 26:15.031
[Shoupe] I'm thinking
this kid might have finished

26:15.115 --> 26:17.284
what his old man started, which means...

26:21.037 --> 26:23.123
-Tag that as evidence.
-[gold clanks]

26:23.206 --> 26:24.791
From now on, we tag everything.

26:25.417 --> 26:26.293
Yes sir, Sheriff.

26:28.962 --> 26:32.632
I think we're lookin' at somethin' bigger,
Thomas.

26:32.716 --> 26:33.592
Somethin'...

26:34.509 --> 26:35.510
a lot bigger.

26:48.148 --> 26:48.982
It'll be fine.

26:49.065 --> 26:50.650
It'll be fine with the <i>Phantom.</i>

26:50.734 --> 26:52.277
-She'll get out quick.
-[sirens blaring]

26:52.360 --> 26:53.194
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:59.075 --> 27:01.119
They're still looking. It's a good sign.

27:02.203 --> 27:03.622
[man] We need one more.

27:03.705 --> 27:06.499
Whoa, whoa! Hey, is that--
is that Sarah Cameron?

27:07.375 --> 27:09.127
Sarah, what are you doing out here?

27:10.712 --> 27:13.965
-Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Landry.
-[Mrs. Landry] What are you doing here?

27:14.049 --> 27:17.802
I'm just taking a nice ride
on my paddleboard.

27:17.886 --> 27:19.346
[Mr. Landry] Sure? Here's some water.

27:19.429 --> 27:21.765
[Mrs. Landry] Sweetie,
there's a storm headed right for us.

27:21.848 --> 27:23.892
-[Mr. Landry] Yeah, you can't stay out.
-What storm?

27:23.975 --> 27:26.186
-[Mr. Landry] You don't know?
-[Mrs. Landry] Get in.

27:26.269 --> 27:28.021
Rose would never forgive me
if we left you.

27:28.104 --> 27:29.564
-Get in. I insist.
-[Mr. Landry] No.

27:29.648 --> 27:32.025
-Please do not tell Rose you saw me.
-[Mr. Landry] We insist.

27:32.108 --> 27:33.652
-I'm begging you.
-Get in the boat.

27:33.735 --> 27:35.153
-Get in.
-No. I'm meeting someone.

27:35.236 --> 27:37.947
-[Mrs. Landry] No. You're coming with us.
-[Mr. Landry] Get in.

27:38.031 --> 27:40.241
-[sirens blaring]
-Shit, man. They're after him.

27:40.659 --> 27:44.329
Hey, you know if we get him dead or alive,
there's a reward. 25K, right?

27:44.412 --> 27:47.040
Yeah, obviously, brother.
That's the first thing I thought of.

27:47.707 --> 27:48.667
Whoo!

27:50.335 --> 27:51.211
-Shit.
-[chuckles]

27:53.463 --> 27:55.048
-Wait. Hold up.
-[Barry] What?

27:55.131 --> 27:56.341
[Rafe] Yo, is that Kie?

27:57.217 --> 27:59.010
There go that little bitch-ass,
right there.

28:17.946 --> 28:19.239
[Shoupe] Historical fact,

28:19.322 --> 28:22.575
it was 400 million...
in British government gold bars.

28:22.659 --> 28:25.328
They got a little, uh,
replica down at the museum.

28:25.412 --> 28:27.372
[Thomas] Oh, yeah, I heard about that.

28:28.415 --> 28:30.750
You ought to check it out,
if you get a chance.

28:30.834 --> 28:32.836
[radio chatter]

28:35.130 --> 28:37.590
They got all kinds of
cool nautical shit in there.

28:37.674 --> 28:39.884
[Thomas] I'll have to check that out
one of these days.

28:40.635 --> 28:42.679
[Shoupe] Let's see what else
we can drum up in here.

29:15.253 --> 29:17.088
Shit. [panting]

29:24.262 --> 29:25.638
[feedback squeals]

29:25.722 --> 29:26.973
Shoupe, you there, buddy?

29:28.099 --> 29:29.184
I think you know who it is.

29:30.560 --> 29:31.561
Come on out.

29:32.979 --> 29:34.189
Nice and easy.

29:35.315 --> 29:36.191
Shit.

29:36.274 --> 29:37.609
Wait, wait, wait! Don't shoot!

29:38.943 --> 29:39.944
I just want to talk.

29:40.028 --> 29:42.197
-All right. Take it easy.
-[John B] I want to talk.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.199
-You gotta listen.
-[Shoupe] John B--

29:44.282 --> 29:45.909
I didn't do it, Shoupe.

29:45.992 --> 29:48.203
Calm down. Keep your hands
where I can see 'em, all right?

29:48.286 --> 29:49.370
Okay.

29:49.454 --> 29:52.582
Now, I'm gonna approach the vehicle,
and you don't run, and I won't chase.

29:52.665 --> 29:54.000
-Okay?
-[John B] Okay.

29:54.083 --> 29:55.502
I wanna talk to you, kid.

29:55.585 --> 29:58.671
-I'm comin' down.
-Hey, listen. Listen. Listen.

29:58.755 --> 30:00.840
-I didn't do it.
-[Shoupe] Okay, I'm listenin'.

30:00.924 --> 30:02.759
[John B panting]
It's not what you think, okay?

30:02.842 --> 30:05.053
-You gotta take your hands--
-Take your hand off your gun.

30:05.136 --> 30:06.346
Both of you, please.

30:06.805 --> 30:09.265
-Tell him to take his hand off.
-Get your hand off your weapon.

30:10.517 --> 30:12.894
All right. So, we're gonna talk, right?

30:13.311 --> 30:14.729
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

30:14.813 --> 30:16.105
-[John B] Yes.
-Okay.

30:17.023 --> 30:18.483
I wanna tell you everything, okay?

30:18.566 --> 30:20.777
-I wanna see that hand.
-[engine starts]

30:20.860 --> 30:21.861
-Don't--
-[Thomas] The car!

30:21.945 --> 30:23.780
-Don't you dare--
-Hey, holster your weapon!

30:27.158 --> 30:28.243
Shit.

30:28.660 --> 30:29.661
God damn it.

30:29.744 --> 30:31.454
[thunder rumbling]

30:32.080 --> 30:33.498
[siren wailing]

30:33.581 --> 30:35.625
Command, this is Shoupe
at the suspect's residence.

30:35.708 --> 30:37.794
We just had a confirmed sighting.

30:37.877 --> 30:41.005
Suspect is currently headed north
on Middle Road...

30:43.842 --> 30:45.927
in a Kildare County Sheriff's vehicle.

30:46.719 --> 30:49.138
[woman] <i>We got him on GPS.</i>
<i>He's on the north end of the island</i>

30:49.222 --> 30:50.431
<i>headed toward the Point.</i>

30:51.057 --> 30:54.602
<i>All units be advised, the suspect</i>
<i>is on the north end of the island,</i>

30:54.686 --> 30:55.812
<i>headed to the Point.</i>

30:55.895 --> 30:57.397
[sirens wailing]

31:05.446 --> 31:06.823
[JJ] There she be.

31:07.490 --> 31:08.449
Hey, girl.

31:09.325 --> 31:13.913
A 1983 Formula 402 SR1.

31:14.956 --> 31:15.915
The <i>Phantom.</i>

31:16.749 --> 31:17.750
-[clicks tongue]
-Mm-hm.

31:17.834 --> 31:20.712
The first boat to make the run to Bermuda
in under 16 hours, Kie.

31:21.754 --> 31:24.507
Forty years old! Forty.

31:24.591 --> 31:27.093
And still the fastest thing
that Kildare's ever seen.

31:27.927 --> 31:29.178
It's kind of a junker.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.140
Really?<i> </i>She's right there, Kie.

31:32.223 --> 31:34.392
She can hear you.
Let's just put it this way.

31:34.475 --> 31:38.730
You would not be smokin' weed right now
if she never existed, okay?

31:39.188 --> 31:41.441
-I just hope it runs.
-[JJ] Oh, no, she'll run all right.

31:41.524 --> 31:43.568
She's faster than any cutters
the boys in blue got.

31:43.651 --> 31:45.320
[motorcycle approaching]

31:45.403 --> 31:47.196
-[tires screech]
-Pope. Finally.

31:49.449 --> 31:51.618
Hey, there. What's goin' on?

31:51.701 --> 31:52.660
JJ?

31:53.536 --> 31:54.829
How you guys doin'?

31:54.913 --> 31:56.372
-Whoo-hoo!
-[Barry whistles]

31:56.998 --> 31:58.291
[clears throat]

31:58.875 --> 32:00.168
Well, well...

32:02.170 --> 32:03.254
[cocks gun]

32:04.672 --> 32:07.467
See, don't think I forgot about
me and you on the side of the road.

32:08.217 --> 32:11.179
I'm here
because I want my motherfuckin' money.

32:11.262 --> 32:12.639
[Kie] JJ! JJ!

32:12.722 --> 32:14.807
-Rafe!
-[Barry] That's what I'm here for!

32:14.891 --> 32:16.059
It's not you we want, Kie.

32:16.142 --> 32:17.685
-Where's John B?
-I don't know!

32:18.353 --> 32:19.395
[Barry] Stay down, boy.

32:19.479 --> 32:20.772
Phew! [chuckles]

32:20.855 --> 32:22.649
I really wish you didn't do that.

32:23.107 --> 32:25.526
-I know what you did.
-[Rafe] What? What did I do?

32:25.610 --> 32:26.819
You murdered Peterkin.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.782
-[thumping]
-[Barry] Listen...

32:30.865 --> 32:32.909
-[JJ grunting]
-[Barry] Where is my money? Huh?

32:32.992 --> 32:33.910
[yelps]

32:33.993 --> 32:36.412
Don't you ever say
those fucking words again.

32:36.496 --> 32:37.580
-Rafe!
-[Rafe] Understand?

32:37.664 --> 32:40.500
-[grunting]
-[Rafe] Do you understand? Where's John B?

32:40.583 --> 32:41.626
Stay down, boy!

32:41.709 --> 32:43.544
-Where's John B?
-I don't know!

32:43.628 --> 32:46.381
-Where's John B? Huh?
-I don't know! I don't know!

32:46.464 --> 32:48.341
-[Barry] Hey!
-Don't touch her!

32:48.424 --> 32:50.176
[both grunt]

32:50.677 --> 32:51.636
[pole clatters]

32:54.806 --> 32:55.932
-Rafe!
-[cocks gun]

32:57.058 --> 32:58.559
[JJ] Kie! Kick it!

32:58.643 --> 33:01.145
[all grunting]

33:05.775 --> 33:06.693
[Kie] Pope.

33:07.318 --> 33:08.194
Okay, Pope.

33:08.987 --> 33:09.821
Pope!

33:09.904 --> 33:11.781
-[JJ] Hey, Pope!
-[Kie] Pope, that's good! Stop!

33:11.864 --> 33:13.366
-[JJ] He's had enough, dude.
-[grunts]

33:13.449 --> 33:15.660
-[Kie] He's good.
-[JJ] Snap out of it, man.

33:15.743 --> 33:17.203
-Snap out of it, dude!
-[Kie] Pope!

33:17.286 --> 33:18.997
-[JJ] Stop, dude!
-Pope, that's too much!

33:19.080 --> 33:21.249
-Dude, come on! Stop! Stop, dude!
-[Kie] Pope! Get off!

33:21.332 --> 33:22.792
-[JJ] Let go! Come on!
-[Pope yells]

33:22.875 --> 33:24.210
[Kie] Look at me!

33:24.293 --> 33:26.004
[hyperventilating]

33:26.671 --> 33:28.131
[JJ] Shit. Oh, shit.

33:29.465 --> 33:30.299
[Kie] It's okay.

33:30.383 --> 33:31.759
-[coughing]
-[Pope groaning]

33:34.387 --> 33:36.180
[Kie] Okay, we gotta go. We gotta go.

33:44.397 --> 33:45.982
-Stay off the cut.
-[engine starts]

33:47.275 --> 33:48.109
[Kie] Pope.

33:48.651 --> 33:50.236
[thunder rumbling]

33:50.319 --> 33:52.321
[siren wailing]

33:59.328 --> 34:00.455
Dude, where is he?

34:00.913 --> 34:03.791
-Give him a second. He'll be here.
-He's coming. He'll be fine.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.168
[siren wailing]

34:07.795 --> 34:09.672
-[Kie] JJ!
-Hey, yeah. Get back on the boat.

34:09.756 --> 34:10.923
-Untie it.
-Shit.

34:13.468 --> 34:14.385
[JJ] Wait.

34:15.428 --> 34:16.429
No way.

34:16.512 --> 34:18.097
-[Pope] No f'ing way.
-I'm sorry.

34:18.181 --> 34:20.683
-You've gotta be kidding me.
-[Kie laughs] Uh...

34:20.767 --> 34:22.310
Shoupe let me take it for a spin.

34:22.393 --> 34:25.646
Okay. That's believable.
I'll buy that for now.

34:26.064 --> 34:28.483
[JJ] It wasn't easy, bro,
but I got the <i>Phantom</i> for you,

34:28.566 --> 34:30.151
and she runs like she was made yesterday.

34:30.234 --> 34:31.694
-[keys jingle]
-[JJ] You ready to go?

34:32.904 --> 34:33.905
Where's Sarah?

34:33.988 --> 34:36.407
-[Kie] She's not with you?
-No, we got separated in the swamp.

34:36.491 --> 34:38.576
-She said she'd meet me here.
-No, we haven't seen her.

34:38.659 --> 34:41.913
-Okay, well, I'm not leaving without her.
-[JJ] John B, look at me.

34:42.288 --> 34:44.749
I know you feel bad for leaving,
but there's no time, man.

34:44.832 --> 34:46.501
You've got plenty of gas,
plenty of food.

34:46.584 --> 34:49.295
Once you get around that point,
it's a straight shot across the sound

34:49.378 --> 34:50.505
to Dismal Swamp, okay?

34:50.963 --> 34:52.965
Once you get there, lay low, all right?

34:53.382 --> 34:55.885
Hang out for a couple of weeks
and then go overland,

34:55.968 --> 34:58.304
cross the border at Brownsville,
you got that?

34:58.387 --> 34:59.222
Brownsville.

34:59.722 --> 35:02.266
-You-- Hey! You got that?
-Yeah, yeah. Brownsville.

35:02.350 --> 35:03.392
[thunder rumbles]

35:03.476 --> 35:06.813
[JJ] All right. Saddle her up,
saltwater cowboy. Let's do this. Yeah.

35:09.273 --> 35:10.233
[John B] Hey. Hey.

35:12.527 --> 35:15.738
I'm sorry for basically...
throwing us off a cliff

35:15.822 --> 35:17.240
with this whole treasure hunt thing.

35:17.323 --> 35:21.327
Hey, John B, yo... we were bound
to run off a cliff at some point, right?

35:21.410 --> 35:22.537
[all laugh]

35:23.162 --> 35:24.038
Yeah.

35:24.997 --> 35:26.624
At least we did it together, though.

35:29.043 --> 35:30.086
Pogue style.

35:31.337 --> 35:32.255
Pogue style.

35:33.005 --> 35:34.507
-Get out of here! Please.
-Now.

35:34.590 --> 35:36.509
We'll see you in two months,
down in Mexico.

35:36.592 --> 35:37.593
[JJ] Love you.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.638
Hey, wait-- wait a second.

35:40.721 --> 35:42.765
[thunder rumbles]

35:42.849 --> 35:44.684
Tell Sarah I said goodbye, okay?

35:47.520 --> 35:50.565
[JJ] Don't forget.
Cross the border at Brownsville, okay?

35:50.648 --> 35:51.607
[John B] Got it.

36:18.926 --> 36:20.136
[distant sirens wailing]

36:22.597 --> 36:23.848
[Barry sighs]

36:25.224 --> 36:26.559
Sheriff Peterkin, huh?

36:27.643 --> 36:30.855
Badder than I thought, Country Club.
[chuckles]

36:31.731 --> 36:33.274
[thunder rumbles]

36:33.357 --> 36:37.403
But you'd better hope that you're worth
a hell of a lot more to me

36:37.486 --> 36:39.071
than that 25K reward.

36:42.658 --> 36:43.951
Hey, Country Club!

36:47.413 --> 36:48.456
I own you now.

37:02.595 --> 37:04.055

[siren wailing]

37:11.103 --> 37:11.979
You okay?

37:13.105 --> 37:15.691
[stammers] I'm sorry for...

37:17.151 --> 37:18.653
acting like a dumbass.

37:18.736 --> 37:20.112
I was just upset,

37:20.196 --> 37:21.697
-and I was acting petty...
-Yeah.

37:21.781 --> 37:23.115
-...and I just...
-It's okay.

37:23.699 --> 37:24.909
...just wanna be friends again.

37:25.868 --> 37:27.536

37:34.752 --> 37:36.212
[Pope sighs]

37:49.684 --> 37:51.143
[sirens approaching]

37:55.106 --> 37:58.109
Hey, guys, I'm sorry to ruin the party,
but, uh, we gotta go right now.

37:58.192 --> 37:59.110
Come on!

38:05.366 --> 38:06.200
[Kie] Pope.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.577
-Move. Hands up! Hands up!
-[Kie] Pope, hands.

38:08.661 --> 38:10.538
[Shoupe] We're too late.
He's gone. God damn it!

38:10.621 --> 38:12.415
Bratcher, have your guys stand down.

38:12.498 --> 38:15.793
Let me talk to these kids.
All right, where the hell is he?

38:15.876 --> 38:17.211
Where the hell is he?

38:17.295 --> 38:20.047
JJ? I see you're livin' up to your name.

38:20.631 --> 38:23.092
Pope, how about you?
This isn't a fucking game!

38:23.175 --> 38:25.052
You can do the right thing now!
Where'd he go?

38:25.136 --> 38:27.555
Suspect has just left Station 26
in a small boat.

John B.

38:54.332 --> 38:58.002
Hey. What are you doing? I didn't think
you were coming. You weren't at the dock.

39:04.884 --> 39:07.386
You were just gonna leave
without saying goodbye?

39:07.470 --> 39:09.347

-[Shoupe] Sorry about that. Here.
-[thunder rumbling]

39:29.408 --> 39:31.702
[man 1] I think so.
They're still trying to verify...

39:44.048 --> 39:47.051
[Shoupe] Sit down. Don't move.
We got a lot to talk about.

39:47.134 --> 39:48.511
Keep an eye on these kids.

39:48.594 --> 39:50.721

I want eyes

40:02.525 --> 40:04.652
[Sarah] It's like
the entire sheriff's department.

40:05.111 --> 40:06.529
Holy shit.

40:08.030 --> 40:10.157
[John B] We'll go dark

[Bratcher] I did...

40:54.201 --> 40:55.119
but now it's gone.

40:55.703 --> 40:58.122
Maybe it's just pickin' up the lightning
from the storm, sir.

41:17.683 --> 41:19.894
[Bratcher] Let's get eyes
on the other side of the Point.

41:20.311 --> 41:22.646
[man 4] We need eyes
on the other side of the Point. Go.

41:23.772 --> 41:24.607
We're clear.

41:26.442 --> 41:28.235
Hey. Hey, we're gonna make it.

41:28.319 --> 41:30.196

-Check the choke!

42:24.250 --> 42:25.960
-The little ball.
-[Sarah] What is the choke?

42:26.043 --> 42:28.337
-Just squeeze the ball, Sarah.
-[Sarah] I'm squeezing it!

42:28.420 --> 42:29.421
[John B] Yes...

42:30.005 --> 42:33.217
Bogey spotted off the lighthouse,

They're headed south.

44:21.075 --> 44:23.577
<i>then you will turn that boat around</i>
<i>and come back.</i>

44:23.661 --> 44:26.413
You are going into a storm

What would you do if I wasn't here?

46:00.591 --> 46:02.801
Look, I'd rather die
than go to jail, Sarah.

I'd rather die than be without you.
