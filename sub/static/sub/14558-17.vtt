WEBVTT

00:10.411 --> 00:13.447
* There's a time
in the early morn *

00:13.481 --> 00:15.816
* When the colors are a little

00:15.849 --> 00:19.687
* Richer than you've ever
seen before *

00:23.224 --> 00:24.358
Thanks a lot, Jo.

00:24.392 --> 00:27.795
* Anymore

00:27.828 --> 00:32.100
* Anymore.

00:35.303 --> 00:37.505
Coffee?

00:37.538 --> 00:39.540
Oh, yeah... uh, no.

00:40.308 --> 00:41.842
Yeah, sure.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.344
Maybe decaf.

00:44.478 --> 00:47.181
You know,
I-I should be at work.

00:47.215 --> 00:49.583
You always feel like you
should be working?

00:49.617 --> 00:51.585
Well, by my watch,
we've got ten minutes

00:51.619 --> 00:53.687
before the session starts, so...

00:53.721 --> 00:55.323
I thought we were
having a conversation.

00:55.356 --> 00:56.724
If you want to wait.

00:56.757 --> 00:59.427
No, no. It's just, you know,
I start feeling like...

00:59.460 --> 01:01.262
I mean, you were a cop.
It's like...

01:01.295 --> 01:04.432
everything you're not there
to stop will happen, right?

01:04.465 --> 01:06.100
Well, last time I heard,
they gave out more than

01:06.134 --> 01:07.335
just one gun and badge.

01:11.839 --> 01:13.274
Turn off the cell phone.

01:13.307 --> 01:15.709
- No, I can't do that.
- Oh, yes, you can.

01:15.743 --> 01:16.644
No way.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.512
You are not on duty.

01:18.546 --> 01:21.182
This is my room, my rules.

01:23.884 --> 01:25.686
(beeps off)

01:36.197 --> 01:38.098
(tires screeching)

01:40.301 --> 01:42.102
(man shouting indistinctly)

01:46.374 --> 01:47.741
(automatic gunfire)

01:55.283 --> 01:56.550
(tires screeching)

01:56.584 --> 01:58.319
Let go of me!

02:03.257 --> 02:04.292
(tires squealing)

02:09.297 --> 02:10.731
So now you're mad at me.

02:10.764 --> 02:11.765
Whatever.

02:14.268 --> 02:16.437
Okay, yeah. Maybe a little.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.805
Because you don't like people
telling you what to do.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.373
Well, do you?

02:19.407 --> 02:20.841
When you came here
the first time,

02:20.874 --> 02:23.544
to get signed off for shooting
Crystal Hoyle,

02:23.577 --> 02:25.446
you got mad at me then, too.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.315
Well, I was in the middle
of a case-- I mean,

02:27.348 --> 02:28.582
- I needed to get out.
- Fastest way to do that

02:28.616 --> 02:30.884
would've been to put a smile
on your face,

02:30.918 --> 02:32.353
spend a few minutes charming me.

02:32.386 --> 02:33.421
So, what,

02:33.454 --> 02:34.388
I was subconsciously saying,
"Help me, help..."?

02:34.422 --> 02:35.556
Let's make a deal.

02:35.589 --> 02:36.890
If you don't use any fancy

02:36.924 --> 02:38.726
psychological mumbo jumbo,
neither will I.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.394
Fair enough.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.796
You know, look, I'm the boss.

02:42.830 --> 02:45.366
I mean, I'm the man
for five years now.

02:45.399 --> 02:48.402
I get used to calling the shots.

02:53.974 --> 02:55.909
DETECTIVE:
Oh, you guys got here fast.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.978
DAVID: We were about 15 blocks
away when we got the call.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.079
What's going on?

02:59.112 --> 03:00.914
We've got one bodyguard dead,
one in the hospital.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.650
Broad daylight kidnapping.

03:02.683 --> 03:05.453
The boy is Jose
Santiago, age 11.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.388
Delivers papers on this
route every morning.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.923
He needs bodyguards
to deliver the paper?

03:09.957 --> 03:11.492
Check out who his dad is.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.760
DAVID:
Is that Che Lobo?

03:12.793 --> 03:14.295
One and only.

03:14.328 --> 03:15.429
COLBY:
One and only what?

03:15.463 --> 03:16.930
Che Lobo Santiago...

03:16.964 --> 03:18.599
CEO and founder of
Stone Ladron Records.

03:18.632 --> 03:21.369
Major Latin hip-hop label.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.404
Also the target
of three separate

03:23.437 --> 03:25.473
LAPD investigations--
Narcotics,

03:25.506 --> 03:26.774
Organized Crime
and Gang Unit.

03:26.807 --> 03:27.908
- Gang Unit?
- DAVID: Yeah...

03:27.941 --> 03:29.777
he came up
18 Street Mexicali.

03:29.810 --> 03:32.380
Not hard to figure out
where his money came from.

03:32.413 --> 03:33.514
Still keeps some of the old crew
on payroll.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.449
Both these guys
are sporting gang tats.

03:35.483 --> 03:37.217
(phone ringing)
Agents!

03:38.486 --> 03:40.288
Dead bodyguard's phone.
(phone ringing)

03:42.956 --> 03:44.458
Reeves.

03:44.492 --> 03:45.693
COLBY:
We've got a cell phone going off

03:45.726 --> 03:47.295
here at the scene
of the kidnapping.

03:47.328 --> 03:48.962
Caller I.D. is a string
of ones.

03:48.996 --> 03:49.830
Okay, keep the line.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.732
I'm gonna have the techs
try to ping it.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.967
(ringing continues)
All right.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.068
DAVID:
Hello?

03:55.102 --> 03:56.637
(electronically distorted):
Let me talk to Che Lobo.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.906
- Who is this?
- The man who has his boy.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.608
3.2 million...

04:00.641 --> 04:02.743
or Jo's dead in an hour.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.623
So you're the boss--
why don't you tell me about

04:15.656 --> 04:16.924
the people who work for you.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.025
What do you want to know?

04:18.058 --> 04:18.826
They handle things...

04:18.859 --> 04:21.028
- when you're not around?
- Sure.

04:21.061 --> 04:24.031
I mean... they're great.

04:24.064 --> 04:26.066
- You don't sound too convinced.
- No, I'm just saying...

04:26.099 --> 04:29.370
you know... I have to look
at them differently, so...

04:29.403 --> 04:31.772
I mean, I know their strengths
and their weaknesses.

04:31.805 --> 04:32.973
Who's in charge when
you're not there?

04:33.006 --> 04:34.942
That would be Megan-- Reeves.

04:34.975 --> 04:35.643
What is she like?

04:35.676 --> 04:38.746
She's smart, fast on her feet...

04:38.779 --> 04:41.081
tough... not trying
to prove it.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.783
No, the press will remain
blacked out.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.051
(phone ringing)
By the time this is over,

04:44.084 --> 04:45.719
the rumors should just be
circulating.

04:45.753 --> 04:48.055
Reeves.

04:48.088 --> 04:49.657
Yes, sir.
I have two agents

04:49.690 --> 04:52.326
outside the victim's house,
and I'll keep you posted.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.462
Hey, has anyone located Don?

04:54.495 --> 04:55.929
LIZ: No. His phone just goes
straight to voicemail.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.931
Here's the tech room's report
on the kidnappers' call.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.967
And let me guess,
there's no time to trap it?

05:00.000 --> 05:02.770
No, they were able to get on it
but it seems like the callers

05:02.803 --> 05:03.971
were using a service
called Webline.

05:04.004 --> 05:05.506
Is that like a computer-
to-computer service?

05:05.539 --> 05:06.840
Right. It's called VoIP.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.075
And the technology is

05:08.108 --> 05:09.877
sort of like text messaging,
but you talk.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.979
Is there any way to trace
this call?

05:12.012 --> 05:13.347
The techs say they might
be able to figure out

05:13.381 --> 05:14.515
which servers the call
went through.

05:14.548 --> 05:16.550
That's still not
gonna give us a location.

05:24.592 --> 05:27.928
- Huh.
- What?

05:27.961 --> 05:29.597
Nothing.

05:29.630 --> 05:31.999
Okay.

05:32.032 --> 05:34.034
Just haven't seen an
Inductive Turing Machine

05:34.067 --> 05:35.703
used like that before.

05:35.736 --> 05:40.107
I'm trying to figure out the
finite state machines for these.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.109
Cognitive Emergence theory
not going well today?

05:42.142 --> 05:43.076
What makes you say that?

05:43.110 --> 05:45.713
You don't look over my shoulder
when it is.

05:45.746 --> 05:46.980
I wasn't looking
over your shoulder.

05:47.014 --> 05:47.981
I was looking at
your shoulder.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.950
The computer just happens
to be in the way.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.985
It's a very
nice shoulder.

05:52.019 --> 05:52.920
(phone rings)

05:55.155 --> 05:57.124
Charles Eppes.

05:57.157 --> 06:00.494
Hey, it's Megan and I'm actually
looking for Amita.

06:00.528 --> 06:01.862
Uh, just hold on.

06:01.895 --> 06:04.565
It's Megan. For you.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.035
Okay...

06:08.068 --> 06:09.870
- Hello?
- Hey.

06:09.903 --> 06:11.439
What can you tell me about VoIP?

06:11.472 --> 06:13.106
Voice over Internet Protocol.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.142
Is there any way
to trace these calls?

06:15.175 --> 06:17.978
VoIP's not like your
conventional phone service;

06:18.011 --> 06:19.880
it's more like e-mail.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.482
Uh, the information
moves through servers.

06:21.515 --> 06:22.650
Listen. I only have...

06:22.683 --> 06:24.452
less than an hour
to catch a kidnapper

06:24.485 --> 06:25.886
and bring back
an 11-year-old boy.

06:25.919 --> 06:28.622
I can't trace a call
that already happened.

06:28.656 --> 06:31.024
But, if the caller uses
the same service again,

06:31.058 --> 06:32.993
I might be able to follow him
in real time.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.562
Could you be here in 15 minutes?

06:34.595 --> 06:36.797
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm on my way.

06:36.830 --> 06:39.066
Megan needs my help tracking

06:39.099 --> 06:41.669
a kidnapper's VoIP call.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.170
Well, I did some
analytical models of

06:43.203 --> 06:45.172
packet retransmission
for several services.

06:45.205 --> 06:47.875
Mm. Would you like to tag along?

06:47.908 --> 06:49.810
If you don't think
I'd be in the way.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.011
BRADFORD:
Reeves...

06:51.044 --> 06:54.014
...has a background
in profiling.

06:54.047 --> 06:56.049
Yeah. You two would
probably get along great.

06:56.083 --> 06:59.687
- The two of you don't?
- No, I'm just saying...

06:59.720 --> 07:01.121
she's good at climbing
into people's heads.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.056
Well, that's a part of the job
description, right?

07:03.090 --> 07:04.291
I mean, you want
a confession

07:04.324 --> 07:06.093
from a murderer, you have to
understand how he's thinking.

07:06.126 --> 07:07.761
You're hunting down a pedophile,

07:07.795 --> 07:08.929
you want to know
why he's doing it,

07:08.962 --> 07:09.897
what he's going to do next.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.064
Yeah. Agreed.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.100
She just might take it
to another level.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.669
(phone ringing)

07:15.703 --> 07:18.506
Talk to me, Colby.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.107
Che Lobo is not cooperating.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.809
He thinks he can
handle this himself.

07:21.842 --> 07:24.111
David's thrown every argument
in the textbook at him,

07:24.144 --> 07:25.813
and a few I think he made up
on the spot.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.147
Okay. Put him on the phone
with me.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.182
All right.

07:29.216 --> 07:34.021
Listen up-- these people put
one scratch on my child,

07:34.054 --> 07:36.123
I'm gonna burn down this
city to get payback.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.858
That's a threat they
will take seriously!

07:37.891 --> 07:40.093
Mr. Santiago, I've got
somebody on the phone for you.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.829
I don't care who you
got on the phone.

07:41.862 --> 07:44.164
Just take the damn phone!

07:44.197 --> 07:45.198
Please.

07:47.535 --> 07:49.102
What?

07:49.136 --> 07:51.705
Mr. Santiago,
this is Agent Megan Reeves.

07:51.739 --> 07:53.607
I want your people off my
property

07:53.641 --> 07:54.608
and I'm within my rights.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.510
- Yes, it is.
- But with your son in danger,

07:56.544 --> 07:58.078
is that really what
you want to do?

07:58.111 --> 07:59.813
You people have been trying
to hit my company

07:59.847 --> 08:01.114
with a RICO case
for three years now.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.716
MEGAN:
Do you sincerely believe

08:02.750 --> 08:04.785
that I care about
any of that right now?

08:04.818 --> 08:07.254
That I care about anything
other than finding Jo

08:07.287 --> 08:09.056
and bringing him home?

08:09.089 --> 08:10.057
I don't know!

08:10.090 --> 08:12.059
MEGAN: I'm not going to tell you
what to do here.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.226
I would like to be
there for you

08:13.260 --> 08:15.596
to provide all
the possible resources

08:15.629 --> 08:17.097
you could use to bring Jo home.

08:20.634 --> 08:23.771
Final decisions will be mine,
you understand?

08:23.804 --> 08:25.138
I think I can arrange
that within reason,

08:25.172 --> 08:28.208
particularly for a man who has
raised his child alone.

08:28.241 --> 08:30.711
Without his mother, I can't
imagine how difficult that was.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.648
His mother died before
he ever even met her.

08:34.682 --> 08:36.116
I'm all he's got.

08:36.149 --> 08:38.285
MEGAN: Which is why we should
put everything else aside--

08:38.318 --> 08:39.820
our egos, our differences
with each other,

08:39.853 --> 08:41.521
and work together
to bring Jo home.

08:42.656 --> 08:44.725
You really FBI?

08:44.758 --> 08:46.794
What else would I be?

08:47.928 --> 08:49.630
You would've made a good lawyer.

08:52.700 --> 08:55.869
Go ahead and open the gate,
vato.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.573
How'd you do that?

08:59.607 --> 09:00.741
Beginner's luck.

09:00.774 --> 09:02.342
All right, so Colby doesn't
let him out of his sight,

09:02.375 --> 09:04.177
and I am rolling you a tactical

09:04.211 --> 09:05.713
response team right now--
you be ready

09:05.746 --> 09:06.914
Okay.

09:06.947 --> 09:09.316
to make a move as we know
what the kidnapper's game is.

09:09.349 --> 09:10.818
Don't let him out
of your sight.

09:16.356 --> 09:19.159
How are we doing?

09:19.192 --> 09:21.662
CHARLIE: Uh, we'll be there in,
like, I don't know,

09:21.695 --> 09:22.730
five minutes.

09:22.763 --> 09:23.664
MEGAN (on phone):
We might not have five minutes.

09:23.697 --> 09:24.331
If you give me the
receiving phone number,

09:24.364 --> 09:26.199
I can put an exploit on it.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.234
What's an exploit?

09:27.267 --> 09:28.736
CHARLIE:
Computer-based cell phones

09:28.769 --> 09:30.237
are pretty much the same thing
as e-mail.

09:30.270 --> 09:33.674
Information packets travel
across the Internet.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.242
It's kind of like luggage
at the airport.

09:35.275 --> 09:37.678
In order to get a suitcase
to its destination point,

09:37.711 --> 09:40.247
it may have to travel through a
number of different airports.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.716
Using an exploit,
we mark the call,

09:42.750 --> 09:43.851
slapping stickers on it

09:43.884 --> 09:44.652
to see which countries
it traveled through.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.253
Right, and in
this circumstance,

09:46.286 --> 09:48.722
the bodyguard's
cell phone acts

09:48.756 --> 09:50.123
as both the
origin point

09:50.157 --> 09:52.259
and the destination
for these packets.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.294
If we know where
the packets travel,

09:54.327 --> 09:56.129
we'll be able to locate
the other caller.

09:56.163 --> 09:57.765
It sounds like a computer virus.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.366
Pretty much, yeah.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.101
I thought you liked
the analogies.

10:01.134 --> 10:02.736
Any other day.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.638
Rico Orojos is out of surgery.

10:04.672 --> 10:05.605
Orojos?

10:05.639 --> 10:07.374
The bodyguard that survived
the kidnapping.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.242
Okay, if you can head over
to the hospital.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.143
As soon as he has
a story to tell,

10:10.177 --> 10:11.111
I'd like to hear it.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.913
All right. I'm on it.

10:12.946 --> 10:16.283
BRADFORD: Why do you think
Megan's so good at it?

10:16.316 --> 10:18.018
You both have the same skills.

10:18.051 --> 10:20.320
I don't know,
she seems to like

10:20.353 --> 10:22.923
knowing how these people think.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.257
And you don't?

10:24.291 --> 10:25.192
Well, me, look...

10:25.225 --> 10:27.427
I spend a day crawling
around in some...

10:27.460 --> 10:32.265
you know, pedophile's brain, all
I want to do is take a shower.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.667
That's what you do?
Take a shower?

10:35.803 --> 10:37.905
Sometimes. Yeah.

10:37.938 --> 10:40.073
I mean, hopefully,
with a few beers,

10:40.107 --> 10:42.109
maybe hook up
with a pretty girl.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.311
And that gets you
where you need be?

10:47.881 --> 10:49.116
CHE LOBO:
You people been trying

10:49.149 --> 10:51.418
to get in here
for three years.

10:51.451 --> 10:53.086
How do you know
we haven't been?

10:53.120 --> 10:55.022
No way.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.456
I have this place swept
every other day

10:56.489 --> 10:57.825
for wires.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.259
It's a hell of a way to live.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.695
You have something,
there's people out there

11:01.729 --> 11:03.130
who'll try to take it
from you.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.698
- Yeah, people like you?
- Yeah...

11:04.732 --> 11:06.133
people like me.

11:07.300 --> 11:10.270
(sighs)

11:10.303 --> 11:11.705
I swore, man.

11:11.739 --> 11:13.340
I swore I would never
let my life

11:13.373 --> 11:14.341
touch him.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.409
That he'd have a chance
to be something better.

11:16.443 --> 11:19.046
A few months ago,

11:19.079 --> 11:20.914
he tells me
he wants a paper route so,

11:20.948 --> 11:23.183
so he could be a businessman,
just like me.

11:23.216 --> 11:24.284
I know

11:24.317 --> 11:25.919
that he meant it
in all the right ways,

11:25.953 --> 11:27.755
because that's the only part
of me I ever let him see.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.291
When you're nine years old,
your dad should be...

11:31.324 --> 11:33.293
Superman.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.128
Yeah.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.233
You have any idea
who might have done this?

11:40.267 --> 11:42.369
You mean, do I got enemies?

11:42.402 --> 11:44.071
Yeah...

11:44.104 --> 11:46.473
every gang in town,
half the record companies,

11:46.506 --> 11:47.240
anybody else out there

11:47.274 --> 11:49.042
who's trying
to get rich fast.

11:49.076 --> 11:49.910
You're looking for a suspect,

11:49.943 --> 11:51.945
pick up your mug book
and pick a page.

11:51.979 --> 11:53.881
(phone rings)

11:57.517 --> 11:59.352
Okay. We're ringing.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.354
Hold on. Guys?

12:01.388 --> 12:03.523
I remotely downloaded
the exploit onto the cell phone

12:03.556 --> 12:05.358
number you gave me;
once the call starts,

12:05.392 --> 12:07.460
I should be able to find
which server is sending out

12:07.494 --> 12:08.495
the other half
of the conversation.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.030
Go ahead, Granger.

12:10.063 --> 12:10.964
(phone rings)

12:12.065 --> 12:13.333
I want to talk to Jo.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.402
MAN (distorted voice):
What's the name of the FBI

12:15.435 --> 12:16.837
who's listening
on the phone?

12:16.870 --> 12:18.839
It's just me.

12:18.872 --> 12:20.407
There's always an FBI dude
listening in.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.508
What's your name, FBI?

12:22.843 --> 12:24.845
Granger.

12:24.878 --> 12:28.215
What's the FBI's success rate
in kidnappings, Granger?

12:28.248 --> 12:30.083
86% is what I read.

12:30.117 --> 12:32.085
Hey, Che?

12:32.119 --> 12:35.022
You willing to risk 14%
on your boy's life?

12:35.055 --> 12:38.258
He comes back alive,
or I swear...

12:38.291 --> 12:40.360
You stopped being scary when
you came up off the streets,

12:40.393 --> 12:41.528
Stone Ladron.

12:41.561 --> 12:43.530
Cash in a black bag.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.432
Pay phone in front
of Disney Hall.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.234
30 minutes.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.036
The phone rings three times,

12:49.069 --> 12:52.239
someone doesn't answer,
the boy dies.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.041
(line clicks, dial tone)

13:04.852 --> 13:06.553
Game on.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.426
Whatever happens next,

13:13.460 --> 13:15.362
we need that 3.2
million, don't we?

13:15.395 --> 13:17.497
It'll give us
more options, yeah.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.967
I got a list of banks
with that kind of cash...

13:20.000 --> 13:21.268
I don't need a bank.

13:21.301 --> 13:25.105
Just a phone call, and
don't ask me who to.

13:27.540 --> 13:30.210
Amita, how you doing
on that trace?

13:30.243 --> 13:31.511
My program followed
the VoIP call back

13:31.544 --> 13:33.446
to an ISP address;
I'm checking on it.

13:35.448 --> 13:36.449
It's a downtown library.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.051
He's using a public hotspot.

13:38.085 --> 13:40.420
- David...?
- We're on our way. Let's go.

13:40.453 --> 13:42.322
MEGAN: Okay, I'm going to
reroute Liz

13:42.355 --> 13:43.190
to meet you there now.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.625
David Sinclair's been
with you for...

13:45.658 --> 13:47.895
Uh, three years.

13:47.928 --> 13:48.862
- Uh-huh.
- I mean,

13:48.896 --> 13:50.530
I didn't even think
he was going to make it.

13:50.563 --> 13:51.932
With the Bureau?

13:51.965 --> 13:53.166
No, with me.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.634
- He was the SAC's guy.
- Mm.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.436
Split loyalties.

13:56.469 --> 13:57.304
Yeah, well,

13:57.337 --> 13:59.206
I was wrong about him.

13:59.239 --> 14:00.173
Look, I give

14:00.207 --> 14:02.375
that guy my back two,
three times a week,

14:02.409 --> 14:04.544
and I don't think twice
about it.

14:04.577 --> 14:07.014
There's nothing
I can't ask him to do.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.282
All right, no one in or out
until I give the all-clear.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.418
If I yell, though,
you guys come in fast, okay?

14:32.472 --> 14:33.506
(phone beeps)

14:34.607 --> 14:37.010
No phone calls. Please.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.378
What is it with you people?

14:38.411 --> 14:40.313
Us people?

14:40.347 --> 14:42.149
I just chased somebody else
out of here.

14:42.182 --> 14:45.052
I mean, it is bad enough when
they listen to music

14:45.085 --> 14:46.053
on their laptops,

14:46.086 --> 14:46.853
but now they sit there
and they talk to them.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.688
BRADFORD:
How do you think

14:48.721 --> 14:50.190
Sinclair feels about you?

14:50.223 --> 14:53.193
I'm his boss, you know, and...
I'm good at it.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.962
You're telling me what you
think; what does he think?

14:54.995 --> 14:57.030
Well, I mean, he probably thinks
I'm tough on him.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.698
But, you know, he knows
it's about the work.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.434
How does he handle it,
when you're tough.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.570
Oh, he's all right.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.372
I mean, he deals with it,
he puts it away.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.107
And where do you put it?

15:07.140 --> 15:10.277
I don't understand-- are we
talking about him or me?

15:10.310 --> 15:14.514
We're never just talking
about one thing.

15:14.547 --> 15:16.216
DAVID: Librarian describes him
as a male, Hispanic,

15:16.249 --> 15:17.617
40s, black, curly hair,

15:17.650 --> 15:19.419
about 170 pounds.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.221
Between five-eight
and five-nine.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.355
We missed him by five minutes.

15:22.389 --> 15:25.425
Okay, I'm going to send
a sketch artist over there now.

15:25.458 --> 15:28.161
Have you pulled background
checks on Jo's bodyguards yet?

15:28.195 --> 15:29.997
Yeah, and LAPD was right.

15:30.030 --> 15:32.499
Rico Orojos and
Carlos Lalo are

15:32.532 --> 15:34.001
both 18 Street Mexicali.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.702
They both have really
long rap sheets.

15:35.735 --> 15:38.338
But you know, so does two-thirds
of Che Lobo's people.

15:38.371 --> 15:39.472
Did you find something
on them?

15:39.506 --> 15:42.075
DAVID: I was kind of wondering
how the kidnappers knew

15:42.109 --> 15:44.444
that Orojos' cell phone was
on this Webline service.

15:44.477 --> 15:45.312
Uh, hey, David.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.114
We were about to raise
that very point.

15:47.147 --> 15:48.248
When you make a VoIP call

15:48.281 --> 15:50.450
to a traditional phone number,
you have to pay a fee...

15:50.483 --> 15:52.085
CHARLIE:
Right, which involves

15:52.119 --> 15:54.587
a traceable transaction,
usually a credit card.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.223
The reason we couldn't trace
these calls,

15:56.256 --> 15:57.590
at least
by traditional means, was

15:57.624 --> 16:00.460
that Orojos's cell phone was
a VoIP client as well,

16:00.493 --> 16:03.430
requiring the installation
of special software.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.632
Which the kidnappers would
have known beforehand.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.300
I ran a check through Webline...

16:07.334 --> 16:09.636
Which must violate two or three
telecommunications laws...

16:09.669 --> 16:10.637
AMITA: Rico Orojos didn't
download

16:10.670 --> 16:13.540
the software onto his cell phone
until last week.

16:13.573 --> 16:14.207
CHARLIE:
Which means

16:14.241 --> 16:16.309
he was expecting that call.

16:16.343 --> 16:18.078
- Which means...
- I know what that means. David.

16:18.111 --> 16:21.181
On our way to the hospital to
have a hard talk with Orojos.

16:21.214 --> 16:22.982
Let's go.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.554
This'll go a lot faster if you
let the SID team in here.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.389
It's bad enough
having one Fed in here,

16:29.422 --> 16:30.423
going through
my boys' things,

16:30.457 --> 16:31.358
looking for dirt.

16:31.391 --> 16:34.161
Looking for a way
to get your son home.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.428
What if you find
something,

16:35.462 --> 16:37.630
maybe some weed, maybe a gun.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.367
Well, I'll probably faint
from the surprise.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.668
There's no way
that Rico's involved in this.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.336
No?

16:43.370 --> 16:44.404
The guy lives
in your guest house,

16:44.437 --> 16:46.473
he wakes up every morning,
looks out that window,

16:46.506 --> 16:48.541
sees how rich you are,
how rich he's not.

16:48.575 --> 16:49.442
I take care
of my boys.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.744
They drive my cars,
they eat my food.

16:51.778 --> 16:54.081
They go to your accountant?

17:00.653 --> 17:01.654
All right, thanks.

17:01.688 --> 17:05.192
So Colby just found evidence
in Orojos's room.

17:05.225 --> 17:07.760
Lobo's tax returns, Stone
Ladron's company reports.

17:07.794 --> 17:10.230
He wanted to know how much cash
Lobo had in liquid.

17:10.263 --> 17:11.231
Exactly.

17:11.264 --> 17:13.300
And how much he could
raise on short notice.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.601
You think he's the brains
behind this?

17:14.634 --> 17:16.403
A guy like him soldiers

17:16.436 --> 17:18.205
as a banger,
he's a soldier now.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.509
All right, am I playing
good cop or bad cop?

17:22.542 --> 17:24.511
Oh, we don't do bad cop.

17:24.544 --> 17:25.545
We're straight-talking G-Men.

17:26.679 --> 17:28.681
DON:
The thing about David

17:28.715 --> 17:29.782
that I worry about is

17:29.816 --> 17:32.419
he's the kind of guy that might
wake up one morning

17:32.452 --> 17:34.654
and just, just realize
he's been doing it too long.

17:34.687 --> 17:37.157
And how long is that?

17:37.190 --> 17:39.326
Long enough
to get cynical.

17:39.359 --> 17:40.693
Hmm.

17:40.727 --> 17:44.431
And you think he's headed
in that direction?

17:44.464 --> 17:48.535
Look, all it takes is
one really bad day, so.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.603
You mean the day that you sent
Agent Edgerton in

17:50.637 --> 17:52.272
to work over a suspect.

17:54.374 --> 17:56.643
Oh, yeah, you'd be
amazed at what I know,

17:56.676 --> 17:59.712
and how I know it.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.748
You see Sinclair

18:01.781 --> 18:03.516
doing the same thing
in the same situation?

18:06.619 --> 18:08.621
No.

18:08.655 --> 18:09.789
Look,

18:09.822 --> 18:11.358
the thing I admire about him is,

18:11.391 --> 18:12.725
the rules don't really
bother him.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.594
I mean, he's the kind of guy
that just somehow...

18:14.627 --> 18:16.596
he gets it done.

18:16.629 --> 18:17.697
Two bodyguards get shot.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.200
One dies, the other catches
an easy shoulder wound.

18:20.233 --> 18:22.202
It's not hard to figure out
who's the inside man.

18:22.235 --> 18:23.270
RICO:
What're you, crazy?

18:23.303 --> 18:24.137
I love Che.

18:24.171 --> 18:26.306
And I love Jo
like he was my own boy.

18:26.339 --> 18:27.807
We know you subscribed
to Wireline

18:27.840 --> 18:30.843
to give the kidnappers an
untraceable line to Che Lobo.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.312
We found his
tax returns

18:32.345 --> 18:33.546
in your room.

18:36.649 --> 18:37.884
I want a lawyer.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.219
Hope you're okay

18:39.252 --> 18:40.687
with some first-year
public defender...

18:40.720 --> 18:42.489
'cause, somehow,
I don't see Che

18:42.522 --> 18:43.623
footing the bill for a good one.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.692
If you don't want
to talk, man,

18:45.725 --> 18:46.826
you have the right;

18:46.859 --> 18:48.661
but I think you
ought to listen.

18:48.695 --> 18:49.862
In 25 minutes,

18:49.896 --> 18:51.531
we've already tied you

18:51.564 --> 18:52.799
to Jo Santiago's kidnapping.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.201
By the end
of the day,

18:54.234 --> 18:55.668
we're going to have enough
to convict you.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.570
If that boy makes it

18:57.604 --> 19:00.840
out of this alive,
that is bad enough.

19:00.873 --> 19:04.844
If he dies, you are looking
at the death penalty.

19:04.877 --> 19:06.479
You can't put that on me!

19:09.816 --> 19:11.684
They crossed us up.

19:11.718 --> 19:13.620
Who's "they" and who is "us?"

19:13.653 --> 19:17.757
Chicano and a white guy,
both of them 40's the hard way.

19:17.790 --> 19:18.425
"The hard way?"

19:18.458 --> 19:20.493
- Ex-cons.
- You got names?

19:20.527 --> 19:21.861
Only met them twice.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.263
Once when they laid it out
for us

19:23.296 --> 19:25.332
and once when we gave them
the books.

19:25.365 --> 19:26.966
I told Carlos
he shouldn't hold on to copies.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.702
But he was all paranoid
about getting a fair cut.

19:29.736 --> 19:31.938
Carlos Lalo,
the other bodyguard?

19:31.971 --> 19:32.872
And he was right, too.

19:32.905 --> 19:36.409
They started shooting
and he went down.

19:36.443 --> 19:37.910
And then I got hit and
I laid down and I played dead.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.879
They figured that money
would cut a lot easier

19:39.912 --> 19:41.248
two ways rather than four.

19:41.281 --> 19:42.715
Coldhearted sons of bitches.

19:42.749 --> 19:45.385
And killing is just part
of the business.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.590
You got to figure they don't
plan on leaving that boy alive.

20:06.606 --> 20:08.441
Granger's a junior agent.

20:08.475 --> 20:10.443
Well, he's got
the least amount of time,

20:10.477 --> 20:11.744
but, you know,
I wouldn't say "junior."

20:11.778 --> 20:12.945
He's got military.

20:12.979 --> 20:15.014
Oh, yeah, Afghanistan.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.683
He bring any of it back
with him?

20:16.716 --> 20:18.718
Well, I mean, you know,

20:18.751 --> 20:21.488
I don't think
he lets it eat him up.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.656
Maybe that's something
you could learn from him, then.

20:23.690 --> 20:27.794
Okay. Maybe.

20:29.829 --> 20:33.700
(Spanish hip-hop song playing
on car stereo)

20:44.010 --> 20:45.412
No questions asked.

20:45.445 --> 20:48.881
You ever seen this much
cash in one place?

20:48.915 --> 20:51.884
Yeah, once.

20:51.918 --> 20:54.053
An Al-Qaeda safe house
in Kandahar.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.789
You take a little for yourself?

20:58.591 --> 20:59.025
You didn't.

21:00.627 --> 21:02.028
Dudley Do-Right.

21:02.061 --> 21:05.632
I don't look good in gold chains
and a pimped SUV.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.837
COLBY:
We got the money.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.839
I have David and Liz
five minutes out.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.841
They're going to run physical
surveillance for you, Colby.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.609
DON: Hey, this is
Special Agent Don Eppes.

21:16.643 --> 21:17.944
Leave a message,
I'll get back to you.

21:17.977 --> 21:20.547
And your brother is still
not answering his phone.

21:20.580 --> 21:21.781
Hey, let me ask you something.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.916
Does $3.2 million--

21:23.950 --> 21:27.854
3.2 million-- does that strike
you as an odd ransom amount?

21:27.887 --> 21:29.922
Yeah and initially, I thought
there must be some kind

21:29.956 --> 21:31.491
of psychological significance.

21:31.524 --> 21:32.792
But once we realized

21:32.825 --> 21:33.960
that the kidnappers had access

21:33.993 --> 21:35.528
to Che Lobo's financial
record...

21:35.562 --> 21:36.963
You assumed
that they were searching

21:36.996 --> 21:38.631
for a Pooling Equilibrium.

21:38.665 --> 21:39.599
Maybe.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.534
Using this data to calculate

21:41.568 --> 21:44.003
the largest sum of money that
they thought Lobo would be able

21:44.036 --> 21:45.071
to obtain on short notice.

21:45.104 --> 21:45.772
AMITA:
Which suggests

21:45.805 --> 21:47.774
fairly sophisticated thinking.

21:47.807 --> 21:50.443
Yeah, given their systematic
approach to the ransom demand.

21:50.477 --> 21:51.511
Well, there is

21:51.544 --> 21:56.549
a set of strategies called
cake-cutting algorithms.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.050
Um, which is kind of like cake?

21:58.084 --> 21:58.885
CHARLIE: Yeah.

21:58.918 --> 22:01.721
How do two people share
a chocolate

22:01.754 --> 22:03.956
and vanilla layer cake?

22:03.990 --> 22:06.926
The obvious strategy is
to cut it down the middle.

22:06.959 --> 22:09.962
But what if one person likes
frosting more than the other?

22:09.996 --> 22:12.665
What if or one person
prefers vanilla cake?

22:12.699 --> 22:15.535
What if one person prefers
chocolate cake

22:15.568 --> 22:16.903
with vanilla frosting?

22:16.936 --> 22:20.873
Well, then it may be that
slices of cake unequal in size

22:20.907 --> 22:23.676
actually creates a fairer
distribution.

22:23.710 --> 22:24.744
And when it's three people,

22:24.777 --> 22:27.914
the strategies become
drastically more complex.

22:27.947 --> 22:28.848
Okay, but we don't know

22:28.881 --> 22:30.016
how many kidnappers
we're dealing with.

22:30.049 --> 22:31.217
We may not need to

22:31.250 --> 22:35.622
if we start with this number
and work our way backwards.

22:35.655 --> 22:36.689
Now, you said
that there were

22:36.723 --> 22:39.492
at least two gunmen
plus two bodyguards, right?

22:39.526 --> 22:41.561
Who they never intended
to count in.

22:41.594 --> 22:42.995
Right, but the
ransom demand

22:43.029 --> 22:45.932
had to convince them that they
were going to receive shares.

22:45.965 --> 22:47.900
Those shares would reflect
the risk

22:47.934 --> 22:50.570
and difficulty
that each person undertakes.

22:50.603 --> 22:54.507
You see, if we induce
a cut-and-choose method,

22:54.541 --> 22:56.843
along with an implicit
Pareto optimality

22:56.876 --> 22:59.679
and take into account the costs

22:59.712 --> 23:01.848
of preparation and
anticipation of escape,

23:01.881 --> 23:04.884
assumptions
of negotiation or loss...

23:04.917 --> 23:06.886
That is some really cool math,
Charlie.

23:06.919 --> 23:09.055
Thank you,
I'm glad somebody noticed.

23:09.088 --> 23:10.089
And that number is?

23:11.458 --> 23:13.092
This is the slice of cake

23:13.125 --> 23:16.496
that the designer of the
kidnapping truly needs.

23:16.529 --> 23:19.466
You know, I think I've seen
that number somewhere before.

23:21.067 --> 23:24.437
Amita, can you
bring up Form 1120?

23:24.471 --> 23:27.006
And I think it's on line 20b.

23:29.041 --> 23:31.210
That is
the initial capitalization

23:31.243 --> 23:33.680
of Stone Ladron Records.

23:43.623 --> 23:45.492
COLBY: All right, Megan, thanks.

23:47.259 --> 23:50.029
What does $1.65 million
mean to you?

23:50.062 --> 23:51.163
It's chump change.

23:51.197 --> 23:53.766
Right, I get it; we're all
really impressed with you.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.102
It's your start-up cost
for Stone Ladron.

23:56.135 --> 23:57.537
So?

23:57.570 --> 23:59.038
So I want you
to think really hard

23:59.071 --> 24:00.807
about who might want
his money back.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.074
You trying to run
some game on me?

24:02.108 --> 24:04.043
We've got two minutes
until this phone rings.

24:04.076 --> 24:05.211
I'm not running a game.

24:09.549 --> 24:11.784
I mean, look, I can't even
imagine what it was like

24:11.818 --> 24:13.085
for him over there.

24:13.119 --> 24:14.821
You've been
in firefights,

24:14.854 --> 24:15.988
lost friends.

24:16.022 --> 24:17.590
Yeah, well, that ain't a war.

24:17.624 --> 24:19.458
Comparing doesn't mean
it's the same thing.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.261
Yeah, maybe you're right.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.831
Maybe it's easier knowing
it's worse somewhere else.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.065
CHE LOBO:
I'm not saying

24:26.098 --> 24:28.100
this really happened...

24:28.134 --> 24:30.269
but maybe there's two guys
in East L.A.

24:30.302 --> 24:33.205
who, back in the day,
hit up a stash house one night.

24:33.239 --> 24:35.074
All right.

24:35.107 --> 24:36.709
What was the other guy's name?

24:37.844 --> 24:40.079
Duque.

24:40.112 --> 24:41.480
Nacio Duque.

24:43.082 --> 24:44.551
They knew they were
going to get paid,

24:44.584 --> 24:47.854
but there was more, a lot more.

24:47.887 --> 24:49.756
1.65 million.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.958
Look, I'm not going
to lie to you, okay?

24:51.991 --> 24:54.160
Duque is the brains
behind all this.

24:54.193 --> 24:55.427
He has the plans.

24:55.461 --> 24:58.130
He knows how to fool the alarms,
get us in and out like ghosts.

24:58.164 --> 24:59.265
(over radio):
The thing is,

24:59.298 --> 25:01.067
he thinks like a general

25:01.100 --> 25:02.769
but he gambles like a fool.

25:02.802 --> 25:04.303
He blows through his half
in six months,

25:04.336 --> 25:06.138
then gets locked up
trying to rob more.

25:06.172 --> 25:09.141
The other guy took his half
and started a record label.

25:09.175 --> 25:10.977
Bank doubled it,
no questions asked.

25:11.010 --> 25:15.715
Duque gets out of jail,
coming around looking for more.

25:15.748 --> 25:19.151
The way he talked to me...

25:19.185 --> 25:21.087
a different man
would have killed him.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.789
Know why I didn't?

25:22.822 --> 25:25.958
Because of Jo.

25:25.992 --> 25:28.160
I'm trying to be
a better father than that.

25:28.194 --> 25:30.029
So I had a
couple of my guys

25:30.062 --> 25:31.130
just drive him out of town

25:31.163 --> 25:34.901
and let him know what would
happen if he came back.

25:34.934 --> 25:36.102
That was two years ago.

25:36.135 --> 25:41.140
So two years nursing a grudge
and planning a kidnapping.

25:41.173 --> 25:43.209
After I get Jo back,

25:43.242 --> 25:47.213
I'm gonna hunt him down
and I'm gonna finish this.

25:47.246 --> 25:50.082
I'm gonna lock him up and
you're going to let me.

25:51.217 --> 25:53.019
(phone ringing)

25:53.052 --> 25:55.254
All right, we set?

25:55.287 --> 25:57.089
Got your back, brother.

25:57.123 --> 25:57.957
In position.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.759
MEGAN: We have the
pay phone tapped.

25:59.792 --> 26:02.194
I'm gonna feed it
through to you-- go.

26:02.228 --> 26:04.096
(phone continues ringing)

26:05.231 --> 26:07.099
Yeah.

26:07.133 --> 26:08.267
- Dad?
- (on phone): Jo.

26:08.300 --> 26:11.203
Everything is going to be okay,
okay?

26:11.237 --> 26:13.372
The next call will
cost you 3.2.

26:13.405 --> 26:16.943
Duque, you touch my kid...

26:16.976 --> 26:20.146
DUQUE: Ah, so the big man didn't
forget.

26:20.179 --> 26:21.413
I was wondering
if you'd wake up.

26:21.447 --> 26:24.250
Now you got three minutes to run
your ass down to Olvera Street.

26:24.283 --> 26:25.284
Phone'll be ringing.

26:27.754 --> 26:28.788
He was on a public
Wi-Fi point

26:28.821 --> 26:30.289
somewhere near Disney Hall.

26:30.322 --> 26:31.991
Colby, he's watching you.

26:33.259 --> 26:34.961
On our way to Olvera Street.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.631
Warner, stay with the money.

26:38.665 --> 26:40.199
Roger that.

26:42.835 --> 26:44.303
It's a good thing
I stretched this morning.

26:44.336 --> 26:45.304
What are you doing?

26:45.337 --> 26:47.807
You show up at the drop,
he's going to kill you.

26:47.840 --> 26:48.941
If I show up,

26:48.975 --> 26:51.143
at least there's a chance
he settles for the money.

26:51.177 --> 26:52.278
Maybe he'll kill you, too.

26:52.311 --> 26:53.880
I know.

26:53.913 --> 26:55.181
Doesn't seem fair, does it?

27:08.761 --> 27:15.134
*

27:18.470 --> 27:27.046
*

27:43.062 --> 27:46.933
(phone ringing)

27:46.966 --> 27:48.100
COLBY:
See anything?

27:48.134 --> 27:49.736
Uh, nothing so far.

27:49.769 --> 27:50.903
DAVID: A lot of people out here.

27:50.937 --> 27:52.271
He could be standing
right next to us.

27:52.304 --> 27:53.205
(ringing)

27:54.306 --> 27:55.708
All right.

27:55.742 --> 27:58.244
Granger, right?

27:58.277 --> 28:00.913
Figured the yellow bastard would
hide behind some kind of cops.

28:00.947 --> 28:04.416
DUQUE: Just remember you're
nothing I didn't plan for.

28:04.450 --> 28:06.385
All right, look,
I want to talk to...

28:06.418 --> 28:07.419
Keyerleber Plaza.

28:07.453 --> 28:08.755
You've got
two minutes.

28:08.788 --> 28:10.723
Oh, and, uh,

28:10.757 --> 28:13.726
stop and give your gun to that
pretty lady in the black sedan,

28:13.760 --> 28:15.828
then tell her to drive away.

28:15.862 --> 28:18.865
I see her again,
I kill the kid and disappear.

28:22.134 --> 28:24.303
All right, he made Liz.

28:24.336 --> 28:25.437
I heard.

28:25.471 --> 28:27.807
Liz, drop back, but you've got
to stay in that area.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.141
- Copy that!
- David.

28:29.175 --> 28:30.276
Already moving.

28:38.250 --> 28:39.752
Were you able
to get a fix on him?

28:39.786 --> 28:41.387
Yeah, it came from a
public Wi-Fi connection

28:41.420 --> 28:42.889
at Hill and Temple.

28:42.922 --> 28:45.892
That's right near
Keyerleber Plaza.

28:45.925 --> 28:46.725
He's leading us.

28:46.759 --> 28:49.528
No, there's a deeper
process at work.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.430
A logical system.

28:51.463 --> 28:52.932
He's methodical,

28:52.965 --> 28:54.834
he's thorough.

28:54.867 --> 28:56.402
This guy'd make
an excellent mathematician.

28:56.435 --> 28:57.536
BRADFORD:
You know,

28:57.569 --> 28:59.972
there's one person on the team
you don't talk about.

29:02.508 --> 29:03.509
What?

29:03.542 --> 29:04.743
You're talking
about Liz Warner?

29:04.777 --> 29:08.180
Sleeping with a junior agent is
a whole other conversation.

29:08.214 --> 29:09.982
Hey, consenting adults, we're
getting the job done, so...

29:10.016 --> 29:11.483
But I'm talking
about your brother.

29:15.021 --> 29:17.089
- Charlie?
- I mean, he's not really...

29:17.123 --> 29:18.825
No?

29:18.858 --> 29:21.393
How many cases has
he worked with you

29:21.427 --> 29:22.829
over the past three years?

29:22.862 --> 29:24.496
CHARLIE:
So far,

29:24.530 --> 29:29.068
he's moved Colby from here
to here to here to here

29:29.101 --> 29:30.336
with what objective?

29:30.369 --> 29:31.804
Spotting surveillance.

29:31.838 --> 29:33.272
Well, then, it's safe to assume

29:33.305 --> 29:35.207
that he has more points
plotted out, right?

29:35.241 --> 29:36.408
More phone
numbers selected.

29:36.442 --> 29:39.378
So he's just going to keep
moving Colby, again and again,

29:39.411 --> 29:41.180
until he feels safe
to take that money.

29:47.486 --> 29:48.855
It's a maze.

29:49.521 --> 29:51.423
He's building a maze.

29:51.457 --> 29:54.426
(phone ringing)

29:54.460 --> 29:56.295
Excuse me.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.031
(ringing continues)

29:59.065 --> 30:00.366
We've got you.

30:00.399 --> 30:03.402
Next time,
you're running, I'm driving.

30:03.435 --> 30:05.471
(phone ringing)

30:06.405 --> 30:07.373
Yeah.

30:07.406 --> 30:08.941
Throw the bag in the fountain.

30:22.121 --> 30:23.255
You got a second wind?

30:23.289 --> 30:24.891
No.

30:24.924 --> 30:26.158
Get the bag out of the water.

30:26.192 --> 30:29.395
You've got two minutes to get to
the Union Station waiting room.

30:29.428 --> 30:31.430
(phone clicks off, dial tone)

30:37.103 --> 30:38.637
What the hell was that about?

30:38.670 --> 30:40.973
Just shorted out the GPS tracer.

30:45.144 --> 30:47.413
How does it make you feel,

30:47.446 --> 30:49.081
bringing your brother
into your work?

30:50.682 --> 30:53.252
Every day, I'm trying
to stop some, you know,

30:53.285 --> 30:55.254
horrible thing from
happening, be it

30:55.287 --> 30:58.257
a killing or a robbery
or a terrorist, you know,

30:58.290 --> 31:01.027
so whatever makes that happen
faster, I-I got to use.

31:01.060 --> 31:03.529
So he's a necessary evil.

31:03.562 --> 31:05.197
No, I didn't say that.

31:05.231 --> 31:07.366
I did not say that!

31:18.244 --> 31:22.314
I mean, I spent a lot of time
in his shadow...

31:22.348 --> 31:24.616
so, yeah, sometimes it's tough.

31:24.650 --> 31:27.453
Sometimes
it-it doesn't feel great.

31:31.423 --> 31:32.691
Well, have you told him that?

31:32.724 --> 31:35.627
Yeah, I mean, you know,
not in those words.

31:35.661 --> 31:37.463
- What kind of words?
- I don't know.

31:37.496 --> 31:40.566
It just... it-it gets confused
or jumbled

31:40.599 --> 31:42.368
because we'll be arguing
about one thing,

31:42.401 --> 31:45.537
but, I mean,
I know it's about that.

31:45.571 --> 31:47.073
CHARLIE:
That's a logic maze.

31:47.106 --> 31:49.141
One with its own set of rules,

31:49.175 --> 31:50.576
except in this case,
the rules change

31:50.609 --> 31:52.378
every time Colby arrives
at a checkpoint.

31:52.411 --> 31:53.612
You know the game Labyrinth?

31:53.645 --> 31:56.548
The toy? A toy to you;
a classic example

31:56.582 --> 31:58.050
of a state diagram to us.

31:58.084 --> 31:59.418
See, in Labyrinth,

31:59.451 --> 32:02.521
you use two knobs to move a
steel ball through a maze.

32:02.554 --> 32:06.058
Those knobs constitute
x- and y-axes

32:06.092 --> 32:09.061
and the ball follows
a simple, curving path.

32:09.095 --> 32:10.429
Now, the speed of the ball adds
a condition.

32:10.462 --> 32:14.366
You eliminate that condition
and fall through the hole.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.602
And what, the holes
represent being captured?

32:16.635 --> 32:17.669
Exactly.

32:17.703 --> 32:19.438
Every time this kidnapper
gets rid of surveillance

32:19.471 --> 32:21.473
or eliminates an
electronic tracer,

32:21.507 --> 32:22.674
he's navigating an obstacle.

32:22.708 --> 32:24.676
You know,
if we use a state diagram...

32:24.710 --> 32:27.279
Using unified modeling
language-- exactly.

32:27.313 --> 32:28.147
Exactly what?

32:28.180 --> 32:31.683
We may be able
to solve this maze...

32:31.717 --> 32:34.453
and tell you where it ends.

32:34.486 --> 32:36.388
*

32:56.742 --> 32:58.644
(phone ringing)

33:04.716 --> 33:07.619
(ringing continues)

33:10.589 --> 33:12.091
Yeah.

33:12.124 --> 33:15.461
DUQUE:
Time to take out your earpiece.

33:18.130 --> 33:19.531
Tell the black guy
by the archway

33:19.565 --> 33:20.532
I'm sick of looking at him.

33:22.234 --> 33:23.735
This can be over right now.

33:29.075 --> 33:29.908
I've been made.

33:29.941 --> 33:31.577
DAVID:
He made Colby ditch his comm.

33:31.610 --> 33:32.711
MEGAN:
You can't drop back.

33:32.744 --> 33:34.113
I don't have anyone else
close enough.

33:34.146 --> 33:36.715
indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

33:36.748 --> 33:38.617
He's headed for the subway.

33:38.650 --> 33:40.419
Don't follow him!

33:40.452 --> 33:42.221
Charlie, I cannot
leave Colby uncovered.

33:42.254 --> 33:43.689
Duque isn't down there.

33:43.722 --> 33:45.724
He's telling Colby
to take the train

33:45.757 --> 33:46.792
and go back to Disney Hall.

33:46.825 --> 33:47.626
How do you know that?

33:47.659 --> 33:48.794
Because I know
where the maze ends!

33:48.827 --> 33:50.629
Yeah, but how can you be sure?

33:50.662 --> 33:53.599
Megan, I would never gamble
with Colby's life.

33:53.632 --> 33:54.733
You and Charlie are good.

33:54.766 --> 33:56.135
Yeah. In a lot of ways,

33:56.168 --> 33:57.703
we're closer than
we ever were as kids.

33:57.736 --> 33:59.138
I mean, I practically
live at his house.

33:59.171 --> 34:00.739
You think he likes
working for you?

34:00.772 --> 34:04.343
Yeah,
I'd like to think so.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.612
I mean, look, we lock horns
every now and again,

34:06.645 --> 34:07.846
but that's the nature
of the beast.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.281
Yeah.

34:09.315 --> 34:10.349
Getting the job done.

34:10.382 --> 34:11.850
Right.

34:11.883 --> 34:13.252
Got to be kind of nice, though.

34:14.453 --> 34:15.587
You were a kid,

34:15.621 --> 34:16.655
everything was about
the genius brother.

34:16.688 --> 34:18.857
Now the genius brother works for
you. No, no, no...

34:18.890 --> 34:20.392
It's a little late in the game,

34:20.426 --> 34:21.059
Hey...

34:21.093 --> 34:22.060
but you finally got control.

34:22.094 --> 34:23.662
I'm not on a power trip
with him, all right?!

34:23.695 --> 34:24.863
We put our lives
in his hands,

34:24.896 --> 34:25.797
he's good at what he does,

34:25.831 --> 34:28.167
and I respect the hell
out of him for it!

34:47.719 --> 34:49.521
Charlie. How the hell else?

34:49.555 --> 34:50.856
Got here just in time

34:50.889 --> 34:53.459
to catch an H2 as it pulled
into the parking garage.

34:53.492 --> 34:54.760
Liz is down there
right now.

34:54.793 --> 34:56.795
Be safe.

35:00.532 --> 35:01.700
All right, we found the H2.

35:01.733 --> 35:02.634
We're moving in.

35:06.172 --> 35:07.306
Where's Duque?

35:07.339 --> 35:09.575
He's close.

35:09.608 --> 35:10.642
You ready to do this?

35:10.676 --> 35:11.810
Yeah.

35:11.843 --> 35:14.180
I'm ready.

35:20.886 --> 35:22.621
All right, it's empty.
He's still got the kid.

35:26.892 --> 35:27.826
Keep coming.

35:27.859 --> 35:30.762
How do I know
Jo Santiago is still alive?

35:38.870 --> 35:41.507
All right, Jo,
we're almost home, bud.

35:41.540 --> 35:42.674
On the stage.

35:54.386 --> 35:55.487
You can stop there.

35:57.256 --> 35:59.157
Unzip the bag.

36:10.436 --> 36:12.671
Let me see.

36:17.443 --> 36:18.244
(gunshot)

36:21.447 --> 36:22.848
Jo, don't move.

36:29.955 --> 36:30.989
Who the hell
opened fire?!

36:31.022 --> 36:32.758
None of ours.
Has to be Duque.

36:32.791 --> 36:34.460
Can you pull them
out of there?

36:34.493 --> 36:35.461
No, no, don't, don't.

36:35.494 --> 36:37.796
(cell phone ringing)

36:37.829 --> 36:39.631
COLBY: We're going to
get you out of here, Jo.

36:39.665 --> 36:41.467
All right?

36:41.500 --> 36:43.835
(cell phone ringing)

36:43.869 --> 36:46.605
Duque has exhibited a highly
sophisticated strategy thus far.

36:46.638 --> 36:47.873
Yeah, a maze with rules.

36:47.906 --> 36:48.907
And this is the end.

36:48.940 --> 36:51.009
No, it's the
final obstacle.

36:51.042 --> 36:52.878
See, by shooting
his partner,

36:52.911 --> 36:54.780
Duque has not only increased
his share of the ransom,

36:54.813 --> 36:56.582
but he's devised
a strategy

36:56.615 --> 36:59.285
that assures himself that
his previous strategy worked;

36:59.318 --> 37:00.919
that Colby is now alone.

37:00.952 --> 37:03.589
Charlie, we can't just wait
for him to make another move.

37:03.622 --> 37:05.557
We don't have a choice.
He's about to make it.

37:05.591 --> 37:08.627
Don't worry,
I promised your dad

37:08.660 --> 37:10.396
I'd get you home safe.

37:10.429 --> 37:11.630
I'm not gonna let him down.

37:11.663 --> 37:13.265
(cell phone ringing)

37:13.299 --> 37:14.400
So you've got
this great team.

37:14.433 --> 37:15.467
Yeah. Best I ever
worked with.

37:15.501 --> 37:16.668
Yeah, but you
don't trust them.

37:16.702 --> 37:18.036
Yeah. Sure I do.

37:18.069 --> 37:20.439
You worry that Reeves
is too compassionate,

37:20.472 --> 37:22.741
that Sinclair plays a little
too close to the book,

37:22.774 --> 37:24.943
that Granger's
seen too much.

37:24.976 --> 37:28.614
You say you trust your brother,
but that's only on your terms.

37:28.647 --> 37:29.881
Hell, you didn't even
trust Ian Edgerton--

37:29.915 --> 37:31.049
- What?
- one of three or four

37:31.082 --> 37:32.751
best known snipers
in the universe--

37:32.784 --> 37:33.919
to take the shot
on Crystal Hoyle!

37:33.952 --> 37:35.053
That's not the way it is!

37:35.086 --> 37:36.988
- Then what is it, Don?
- What is it?!

37:37.022 --> 37:38.524
Look, I'm their boss!

37:38.557 --> 37:39.758
I don't have to trust them!

37:39.791 --> 37:41.327
It's their job to trust me!

37:47.699 --> 37:52.338
(sighs):
Oh... man.

37:53.772 --> 37:57.376
When you build a maze,
there's always math there,

37:57.409 --> 37:59.345
whether it's intentional
or unintentional.

37:59.378 --> 38:00.346
The level sequence
always starts with

38:00.379 --> 38:01.513
a zero and ends with an "N".

38:01.547 --> 38:03.615
Does anyone have eyes
on the shooter?

38:05.083 --> 38:06.318
Shot came from
the northwest side.

38:06.352 --> 38:07.553
But he could have moved by now.

38:07.586 --> 38:08.920
(cell phone ringing)

38:12.591 --> 38:13.525
Yeah.

38:14.660 --> 38:16.662
Got you both in my crosshairs.

38:16.695 --> 38:18.464
Take the money

38:18.497 --> 38:19.431
and go out the way you came.

38:19.465 --> 38:21.032
You make a wrong move,

38:21.066 --> 38:23.369
and I shoot the kid first.

38:29.641 --> 38:30.876
Hey, Megan, check this out.

38:30.909 --> 38:31.910
Duque brought Colby

38:31.943 --> 38:33.812
in through this entrance here

38:33.845 --> 38:36.715
and Jo and his partner
through this entrance here.

38:36.748 --> 38:39.451
So assuming he's anticipated
the fastest egress,

38:39.485 --> 38:41.987
- it's the East Terrace.
- You sure?

38:42.020 --> 38:43.655
We don't have time
for me to be sure.

38:47.158 --> 38:48.894
All right, Jo,

38:48.927 --> 38:50.462
you ready
to get out of here, bud?

38:50.496 --> 38:51.563
Come on.

38:52.931 --> 38:54.366
Stick tight to me.

38:59.771 --> 39:00.872
FBI.

39:01.907 --> 39:03.074
Hands off the gun.

39:05.544 --> 39:07.045
Hands off that trigger
right now.

39:15.787 --> 39:17.756
Pass it to me.

39:21.059 --> 39:23.595
Two years.

39:23.629 --> 39:26.632
I been planning this
for two years.

39:26.665 --> 39:28.667
You have about 15 to 20
to come up with a new one.

39:33.505 --> 39:35.173
You grew up in the shadow
of Albert Einstein.

39:35.206 --> 39:38.544
Playing baseball, just not
good enough to make the bigs.

39:38.577 --> 39:40.111
And you finally
find something

39:40.145 --> 39:42.047
that you're good at.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.750
You're terrified that'll be
taken away from you, too.

39:44.783 --> 39:46.685
Yeah, well, you know,
this isn't exactly

39:46.718 --> 39:48.587
making me feel
a hell of a lot better.

39:48.620 --> 39:50.422
You want to feel better,
take a pill.

39:50.456 --> 39:53.091
You want to get right,
face the truth.

39:53.124 --> 39:54.760
(sighs)

39:54.793 --> 39:56.061
You're not
worried about

39:56.094 --> 39:57.963
your team falling apart
because you're not there.

39:57.996 --> 39:59.498
You're afraid that they won't.

40:00.732 --> 40:02.634
That Don Eppes doesn't matter.

40:02.668 --> 40:04.169
You said it:
There's a lot of guns and badges

40:04.202 --> 40:05.937
out there, you know?
I mean, one of us falls,

40:05.971 --> 40:07.506
there's someone
right there to take our place.

40:07.539 --> 40:09.608
That's pretty much
the human condition, Don.

40:09.641 --> 40:12.711
It's what you do
before you fall--

40:12.744 --> 40:13.812
that's what counts.

40:19.184 --> 40:20.452
You brought
Sinclair along

40:20.486 --> 40:22.220
from a rookie-- Granger, too.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.656
When Reeves
gets her team,

40:24.690 --> 40:26.725
who do you think she's
gonna come to for advice?

40:26.758 --> 40:30.896
Who had the balls to bring in
a damn math professor

40:30.929 --> 40:32.598
to solve federal felonies

40:32.631 --> 40:35.100
and the brains to
watch it work?

40:35.133 --> 40:36.968
What you have to do
is stop worrying about

40:37.002 --> 40:38.670
life passing you by,

40:38.704 --> 40:40.806
and start enjoying
what you put into it.

40:40.839 --> 40:42.941
Every time one of

40:42.974 --> 40:45.644
your people shines...

40:45.677 --> 40:47.579
it's on you.

41:01.793 --> 41:03.629
Dad, I knew
you'd get me home.

41:03.662 --> 41:04.663
- You okay?
- Yeah.

41:04.696 --> 41:06.498
You sure?

41:06.532 --> 41:07.699
Yeah.

41:10.201 --> 41:12.237
I know we go back to
our corners tomorrow,

41:12.270 --> 41:14.540
but I owe you one.

41:16.875 --> 41:18.276
You ever need
to call it in,

41:18.309 --> 41:19.778
no questions asked.

41:19.811 --> 41:22.013
I'll see you tomorrow.

41:23.214 --> 41:25.517
Jo, see you, bud.

41:25.551 --> 41:27.252
Thank you.

41:31.690 --> 41:32.591
You okay?

41:36.127 --> 41:38.664
(laughter)

41:38.697 --> 41:39.698
Oh, yeah, a maze, right.

41:39.731 --> 41:41.132
You guys risked my life
on a maze.

41:41.166 --> 41:43.168
Wait--
there was no risk involved.

41:43.201 --> 41:44.035
Obviously, I would never...

41:44.069 --> 41:45.871
And the two of you guys
let him do it.

41:45.904 --> 41:46.938
(laughter)

41:46.972 --> 41:48.173
DAVID: The real risk was letting
you

41:48.206 --> 41:49.908
get on that train alone...

41:49.941 --> 41:51.009
With three
million dollars!

41:51.042 --> 41:52.277
(laughter)

41:52.310 --> 41:54.279
You know, Charlie, that
math was very elegant.

41:54.312 --> 41:56.815
You should think about
having it published.

41:56.848 --> 41:58.584
Yeah, I think I'll wait
for the movie.

41:58.617 --> 42:00.185
(laughter)

42:00.218 --> 42:01.620
Hey, guys,
sorry I'm late.

42:01.653 --> 42:03.054
Hey, Don, what's up
with your phone?

42:03.088 --> 42:05.223
Oh, damn. I'm sorry.

42:05.256 --> 42:06.792
I forgot to turn it back on.

42:08.093 --> 42:08.960
I miss anything?

42:10.095 --> 42:11.997
Just another day
at the FBI.

42:12.030 --> 42:13.599
(Megan chuckles)

42:13.632 --> 42:15.166
There might be a report
on your desk.

42:16.167 --> 42:17.135
All right, who wants lunch?

42:17.168 --> 42:18.069
I guess I'm buying.

42:18.103 --> 42:20.806
DAVID:
But mark the date,

42:20.839 --> 42:22.007
somebody, please.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.775
MEGAN: Charlie,
what are the odds?

42:23.809 --> 42:25.644
CHARLIE: Oh, well, they say
there's no such thing

42:25.677 --> 42:27.078
as a truly random
occurrence, but...

42:27.112 --> 42:28.747
(everyone laughing)

42:28.780 --> 42:31.082
CHARLIE: You were random there,
Colby. It's fairly random.

42:31.116 --> 42:32.751
* Oye, bebe, oye, mami *

42:32.784 --> 42:35.754
* ВїDГіnde estГЎ laafter-party? *

42:35.787 --> 42:37.188
* Hey...

42:37.222 --> 42:38.757
* Hey.
