WEBVTT

00:00.375 --> 00:03.416
I gotta get goin'

00:03.416 --> 00:07.000
a friend of mine

00:08.583 --> 00:11.416
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.083 --> 00:17.583
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.583 --> 00:20.958
I know he's out there

00:24.583 --> 00:28.125
we're so adventurous

00:28.125 --> 00:31.250
and again

00:31.250 --> 00:34.875
and there's nobody home

00:34.875 --> 00:38.333
to count on a friend

00:38.333 --> 00:41.875
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.875 --> 00:45.375
take me, please?

00:45.375 --> 00:48.750
I got to be there

00:50.750 --> 00:56.000
Winnie the Pooh

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Oh, this bronzed shoe
will look nice

01:11.000 --> 01:12.583
to my very small
picture of me

01:12.583 --> 01:14.833
as a very,
very small animal.

01:14.833 --> 01:16.083
Tigger: Why, Pigalet,

01:16.083 --> 01:17.583
I never knew
you had a-- a--

01:17.583 --> 01:19.458
a thingaroo like this.

01:19.458 --> 01:21.000
Oh, I found it

01:21.000 --> 01:23.250
and decided to display
my favorite daffodil.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.708
Why, Piglet,
where did you get this?

01:25.708 --> 01:27.083
Well, you see--

01:27.083 --> 01:28.458
Hey, Piglet,

01:28.458 --> 01:30.416
what's that
supposed to be?

01:30.416 --> 01:32.000
Oh, it's just something--

01:32.000 --> 01:34.333
Yeah. It's really
something, all right.

01:34.333 --> 01:35.583
Heh heh.

01:35.583 --> 01:38.000
But, uh, what, exactically?

01:38.000 --> 01:40.208
Why, it's obviously
a-- a--

01:40.208 --> 01:43.166
Kind of reminds me of...

01:43.166 --> 01:45.875
Oh, I say, a running trophy.

01:45.875 --> 01:48.416
I'd recognize one anywhere.

01:48.416 --> 01:50.166
Aw, of course it is.

01:50.166 --> 01:52.208
Pigalet, why didn't
you ever let on

01:52.208 --> 01:54.250
you were so fleet of footsies?

01:54.250 --> 01:57.708
. It's
really nothing at all.

01:57.708 --> 02:01.166
He wins a running trophy
and calls it nothing.

02:01.166 --> 02:03.333
What modesty.

02:03.333 --> 02:05.333
But that's our Piglet.

02:05.333 --> 02:08.000
Why, Piglet, I never knew.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.375
Or perhaps I did and forgot.

02:11.375 --> 02:14.125
Okay, let's see
what you got, Pigalet.

02:14.125 --> 02:16.208
But, Tigger--
But, uh-- B-But--

02:16.208 --> 02:19.083
Show us how fast you can
run to that tree and back.

02:19.083 --> 02:22.458
1 for the honey,
2 for the road,

02:22.458 --> 02:26.083
3 to get ready,
and off you go!

02:26.083 --> 02:29.500
Why, that was so fast,
I didn't even see you go.

02:29.500 --> 02:32.291
It's a new
world's record.

02:32.291 --> 02:33.875
Astonishing.

02:33.875 --> 02:35.958
That was wonderful, Piglet.

02:35.958 --> 02:38.708
I always knew
Piglet was very sudden.

02:38.708 --> 02:40.833
I've seen him
run away from things

02:40.833 --> 02:43.416
that aren't even things
to run away from.

02:43.416 --> 02:46.083
Yeah, well, that must be
how he keeps in training.

02:46.083 --> 02:50.166
You know, traditionally,
races are held once a year

02:50.166 --> 02:52.166
to give others
an opportunity

02:52.166 --> 02:54.625
to acquire such
a magnificent award.

02:54.625 --> 02:57.708
Yeah. Why, I'd give away
old bunny boy here

02:57.708 --> 02:59.083
for a trophy like that.

02:59.083 --> 03:01.000
Here, Tigger. It's yours.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.291
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!
I won!

03:03.291 --> 03:07.458
Nonsense. This
beautiful trophy must
be won by winning it.

03:07.458 --> 03:11.625
Uh, Rabbit, Gopher, uh,
uh, I just wanted to say

03:11.625 --> 03:15.125
that I certainly don't need
to keep this, uh, trophy

03:15.125 --> 03:16.583
all to myself.

03:16.583 --> 03:20.500
Well, that's
the stuff, sonny.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.500
What sportsmanship.

03:22.500 --> 03:24.000
I got to get into training.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.583
Uh, me, too.

03:25.583 --> 03:27.458
Same here.

03:27.458 --> 03:29.000
You know, Piglet,

03:29.000 --> 03:31.708
I don't believe
I'll race this race

03:31.708 --> 03:33.583
because this trophy
doesn't look

03:33.583 --> 03:35.750
as though it would
hold much honey.

03:35.750 --> 03:39.750
But I will be very pleased
to see you win it again.

03:40.833 --> 03:42.458
You will?

03:42.458 --> 03:44.375
Oh, d-d-dear.

03:44.375 --> 03:48.458
How could I have let
whatever just happened happen?

03:49.625 --> 03:52.000
1 and 2 and no time to chat.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.500
- And 1 and--
- Rabbit, about this race--

03:54.500 --> 03:56.625
Now, if you'll
excuse me-- --

03:56.625 --> 03:59.875
I have some intensive
training to undo.

03:59.875 --> 04:02.583
I can't run very well at all.

04:02.583 --> 04:04.208
Huh. Trying to fool us

04:04.208 --> 04:07.000
into thinking
you're slow, hmm?

04:07.000 --> 04:09.583
Well, I'm going
to be ready.

04:09.583 --> 04:12.625
Whoa!

04:12.625 --> 04:16.458
Oh, dear. I can't fly
very well, either.

04:16.458 --> 04:19.083
You want the trophy,
too, Eeyore?

04:19.083 --> 04:23.000
It's not the trophy I'm
interested in, little Piglet.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.375
It's the flower.

04:24.375 --> 04:25.833
Uh, Tigger,

04:25.833 --> 04:27.250
there's something
I have to tell you

04:27.250 --> 04:28.500
about my running.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.875
Aw, don't worry,
Pigalet.

04:30.875 --> 04:32.583
I know I can't
expect to beat

04:32.583 --> 04:34.250
an exceptionabibble
runner like you.

04:35.416 --> 04:37.208
But it's going
to be fun trying.

04:37.208 --> 04:39.250
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

04:39.250 --> 04:42.000
Everybody, this has
gone far enough.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.833
I've never won any trophies,

04:43.833 --> 04:45.708
so there's no need
to have a race.

04:45.708 --> 04:48.458
Yes. That's what I must say.

04:48.458 --> 04:51.416
I can't let this idea
go any farther.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.458
That's all there is to it.

04:56.750 --> 04:59.375
Owl: Runners must follow
the marked route.

04:59.375 --> 05:02.583
That reminds me of the time
my great-uncle Bigelow--

05:02.583 --> 05:04.500
And may the best tigger win.

05:04.500 --> 05:07.375
What? Oh.
I beg your pardon.

05:07.375 --> 05:09.708
Uh, runners, on your mark.

05:09.708 --> 05:10.958
Get set.

05:10.958 --> 05:13.708
Uh, just a moment.
Where's Piglet?

05:13.708 --> 05:16.416
Maybe he's
already finished.

05:16.416 --> 05:20.083
Ahem. Everybody, I know
what you all expect
to happen here today,

05:20.083 --> 05:23.000
but, um, there's
something I must say.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.958
And you may say it,
Piglet,

05:24.958 --> 05:27.458
just as soon as I say go.

05:28.875 --> 05:30.250
Hooray!

05:31.750 --> 05:34.416
Now don't give us
a head start, Piglet.

05:34.416 --> 05:37.500
We want to win this race
fair and square.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.458
Uh, c-come back!

05:39.458 --> 05:40.583
Hooray.

05:42.875 --> 05:45.458
In first place
is Tigger by a tail.

05:45.458 --> 05:47.416
Now Rabbit by a hare.

05:47.416 --> 05:49.458
Gopher by a-- by a--

05:49.458 --> 05:50.833
by a tooth.

05:50.833 --> 05:53.583
And the current champion
is in the last place

05:53.583 --> 05:55.583
one would expect to find him,

05:55.583 --> 05:58.083
which is last place.

06:02.458 --> 06:07.708
Shortest distance between two
points is a straight tunnel.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.708
If I don't finish first,

06:16.708 --> 06:18.958
everybody will be
so disappointed.

06:27.375 --> 06:31.166
Oh, my. Aah!

06:31.166 --> 06:34.000
I say, Rabbit seems to have
cut a bit of distance

06:34.000 --> 06:35.458
off the course,

06:35.458 --> 06:37.166
taking over first place.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.875
Seems I've lost my tail,
little Piglet.

06:42.875 --> 06:45.833
Wouldn't want to win the race
without all of me there.

06:45.833 --> 06:48.166
Uh, Eeyore,
about this trophy--

06:48.166 --> 06:50.458
It sure is nice
of you, Piglet.

06:50.458 --> 06:53.250
I haven't had
so much fun since--

06:53.250 --> 06:54.458
Hawmp!

06:57.416 --> 06:59.208
Owl: It's Tigger
in the lead, but--

06:59.208 --> 07:01.875
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!
I'm gonna win!

07:01.875 --> 07:04.833
I'd say he's chosen
to make a pit stop.

07:07.875 --> 07:11.083
Tigger, I really
must tell you--

07:11.083 --> 07:12.583
I can't stop now,
little Piglet.

07:12.583 --> 07:14.000
I got to catch up
with you.

07:15.875 --> 07:17.375
Owl: Oh, my.

07:17.375 --> 07:20.625
If seems frontrunner Gopher
has had a blowout.

07:22.708 --> 07:25.458
Gopher, I just
want you to know--

07:25.458 --> 07:28.166
Ah, don't worry
about me, sonny.

07:28.166 --> 07:32.000
You go ahead.
I've got a spare.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.375
Now it's Tigger
in first place.

07:34.375 --> 07:36.000
Or is that Rabbit?

07:36.000 --> 07:39.125
Why, I believe
it may be Eeyore.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.875
And in last place, Piglet.

07:41.875 --> 07:44.583
Now it's-- Well,
someone must be leading.

07:44.583 --> 07:46.708
I'm sure you're right,
Owl,

07:46.708 --> 07:48.416
but where are they?

07:50.125 --> 07:52.875
My word. They're
approaching the swamp.

07:54.458 --> 07:58.375
This could become a rather
sticky situation.

07:58.375 --> 08:00.250
It could?

08:00.250 --> 08:02.208
Yes, indeed.

08:02.208 --> 08:04.958
I definitely have to say
they're stuck.

08:04.958 --> 08:07.416
I remember when
my great-aunt Cordelia

08:07.416 --> 08:09.416
fell asleep
in a tar barrel.

08:09.416 --> 08:10.833
Owl!

08:10.833 --> 08:11.875
Yes?

08:11.875 --> 08:15.000
We have only one
thing to say.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.250
Yes?

08:16.250 --> 08:18.500
Help!

08:19.875 --> 08:22.333
Oh, dear.

08:22.333 --> 08:24.958
Whoever among you
I helped first

08:24.958 --> 08:27.333
would gain
an unfair advantage.

08:27.333 --> 08:31.083
The principles of fair play
demand that I,

08:31.083 --> 08:32.875
as an official of this race,

08:32.875 --> 08:36.458
must at all costs
maintain impartiality.

08:40.166 --> 08:42.291
Hooray!

08:42.291 --> 08:45.000
No, Pooh. Everyone's
in terrible trouble.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.166
They're stuck in the swamp.

08:46.166 --> 08:47.166
What shall I do?

08:47.166 --> 08:49.125
Well, Piglet,

08:49.125 --> 08:51.125
if they can't finish the race,

08:51.125 --> 08:53.583
take the finish
of the race to them.

08:53.583 --> 08:56.833
Oh, of course.
That's a wonderful idea, Pooh.

09:06.333 --> 09:08.958
Oh, my. We've lost
so much time.

09:08.958 --> 09:10.583
I'm gonna have to run
twice as fast

09:10.583 --> 09:12.375
just to catch up
with myself.

09:12.375 --> 09:14.500
Thanks, Piglet. See you
at the finish line.

09:14.500 --> 09:17.333
But I-- But--
Oh, it's too late.

09:17.333 --> 09:19.125
Everyone
is going to find out

09:19.125 --> 09:21.458
that I'm not at all
what they expect me to be.

09:21.458 --> 09:24.500
Oh, it's difficult
when large expectations

09:24.500 --> 09:27.875
become very large
unexpectations.

09:27.875 --> 09:29.333
Perhaps it would be best

09:29.333 --> 09:32.625
to do something
unexpected for a change.

09:40.958 --> 09:43.875
I won. I...won.

09:43.875 --> 09:47.125
If nobody minds my saying so,

09:47.125 --> 09:50.333
seems to me that I
got here first.

09:50.333 --> 09:55.458
Say, ahem, what are you
talking about? I won.

09:55.458 --> 09:58.625
You won?
Who's the winner, Owl?

09:58.625 --> 10:00.875
It was, I must say,

10:00.875 --> 10:03.000
the closest finish
I've seen

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
since the time
my uncle Albert

10:05.000 --> 10:08.416
raced from Albania
to Zanzibar.

10:08.416 --> 10:12.250
Pooh, would you
kindly tell them
who won the race?

10:12.250 --> 10:17.000
Well, actually, I'm afraid
you're all too late.

10:19.708 --> 10:23.833
I don't think anyone would
expect me to move away.

10:24.875 --> 10:26.583
Pooh: What are you
doing, Piglet?

10:26.583 --> 10:29.333
I'm leaving
the Hundred Acre Wood,

10:29.333 --> 10:32.000
moving far, far away

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
to some place where
the unexceptional

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
won't be expected to excel
beyond expectations.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.875
Uh, could you
say that again

10:39.875 --> 10:41.583
a little looser?

10:41.583 --> 10:43.750
Oh, I let you all down.

10:43.750 --> 10:45.708
I never won a race in my life.

10:45.708 --> 10:48.750
Why, Piglet, of course
you've won a race.

10:48.750 --> 10:50.750
Sure. You won this one.

10:50.750 --> 10:54.583
Wasn't that the finishing line
you saved us with?

10:54.583 --> 10:56.583
Oh, why, yes.

10:56.583 --> 10:58.333
I guess it was.

10:58.333 --> 11:03.000
Ooh, and so this trophy
is awarded to you, Piglet.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.083
Me?

11:04.083 --> 11:05.291
Why, certainly.

11:05.291 --> 11:07.833
You won, just like we
expected you to.

11:07.833 --> 11:10.583
Now only did you win,
but, heh heh,

11:10.583 --> 11:13.583
you helped everyone else
come in second.

11:13.583 --> 11:15.875
Hooray for Piglet,

11:15.875 --> 11:18.750
for doing exactly what we
expected him to do

11:18.750 --> 11:23.083
in a very "I'm your best
friend Piglet" sort of way.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.083
- Definitely.
- Posilutely.

11:25.083 --> 11:26.458
Well, thank you.

11:26.458 --> 11:28.583
This will look very nice
indeed on my shelf

11:28.583 --> 11:31.125
next to the trophy
I won for weightlifting.

11:33.333 --> 11:34.875
Just kidding.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.375
Gopher: Jump, Piglet!

11:50.458 --> 11:52.583
Help! Oh, help!

11:52.583 --> 11:54.583
More scared, Piglet!

11:54.583 --> 11:58.166
I'm afraid I'm too afraid
to be more afraid.

11:58.166 --> 11:59.958
Yeah, I don't blame you,
Piglet.

11:59.958 --> 12:01.500
I'm terrifying, aren't I?

12:01.500 --> 12:02.875
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

12:02.875 --> 12:05.208
Tiggers always play
the bad guys best.

12:05.208 --> 12:07.166
Where's the ladder?

12:07.166 --> 12:10.458
How can we save Piglet
without my portable ladder?

12:10.458 --> 12:12.500
This ladder is too short.

12:12.500 --> 12:15.458
That's what makes it
so portable.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.458
Too high! Aah!
It's too high!

12:21.458 --> 12:24.750
Whoops. Hmm,
now where's that reverse?

12:24.750 --> 12:27.583
I'll have you down
before you can say--

12:27.583 --> 12:29.958
Aah!

12:29.958 --> 12:32.083
Better try the net.

12:32.083 --> 12:33.375
Jump, Piglet!

12:33.375 --> 12:36.458
Oh, I don't think I can.

12:36.458 --> 12:37.875
But it's easy, Piglet.

12:37.875 --> 12:39.416
Just do this.

12:39.416 --> 12:40.833
Help!

12:40.833 --> 12:42.833
Hmm. Fast learner.

12:49.875 --> 12:53.250
Rabbit, what kind
of saving was that?

12:53.250 --> 12:56.875
Well, I did my part just
as I was supposed to.

12:56.875 --> 12:59.416
Looks like you're
short one life saver.

12:59.416 --> 13:01.000
Good morning, everyone.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.166
Eh, you're late.

13:03.166 --> 13:04.875
Where
have you been?

13:04.875 --> 13:06.875
I believe
I've been right here,

13:06.875 --> 13:10.708
although I did spend
some time over there, too.

13:10.708 --> 13:15.208
You missed the fire drill.
Messed up the whole thing.

13:15.208 --> 13:17.875
You're even running too late
to be late, Pooh boy.

13:17.875 --> 13:22.083
You are without a doubt
the slowest bear there is.

13:22.083 --> 13:24.458
Why, thank you, Rabbit.

13:24.458 --> 13:27.708
You can't go around
being late all the time.

13:27.708 --> 13:29.875
Late for this,
late for that.

13:29.875 --> 13:31.583
Just won't do, Pooh.

13:31.583 --> 13:34.416
Throws everything
out of whack.

13:34.416 --> 13:37.750
Destroys the balance
of things.

13:37.750 --> 13:42.291
Is there anything I can do
to put things back in whack?

13:42.291 --> 13:45.958
Well, you could start by
being on time for once.

13:45.958 --> 13:49.458
It's best, Pooh, if you don't
wait until the last minute.

13:49.458 --> 13:54.125
Yes, Piglet. But I never know
which is the last minute.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.875
There always seem to be
more minutes left over.

13:56.875 --> 13:59.000
If you move any slower,
buddy bear,

13:59.000 --> 14:00.583
you're going to be
going backwards.

14:00.583 --> 14:03.875
Ah! By dinghy, that's it!

14:03.875 --> 14:05.125
What's it?

14:05.125 --> 14:07.583
A way to get everything
back on track.

14:07.583 --> 14:10.291
We'll speed the bear up.

14:10.291 --> 14:15.458
We'll get him moving
like the wind itself.

14:15.458 --> 14:17.833
Once you take
the specifications

14:17.833 --> 14:19.250
of that fluff-filled head

14:19.250 --> 14:22.000
and full stomach
into consideration--

14:22.000 --> 14:24.625
And just when are you
going to speed him up?

14:24.625 --> 14:26.416
Keep your ears on.

14:26.416 --> 14:30.083
It's going to take some time
to get Pooh on time.

14:30.083 --> 14:32.250
And you're certainly
taking enough time

14:32.250 --> 14:34.000
with all this nonsense.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.583
I'll get Pooh moving.

14:35.583 --> 14:36.958
Oh, good.

14:36.958 --> 14:38.708
Perhaps we'll have
time left over

14:38.708 --> 14:40.958
for something sweet.

14:40.958 --> 14:42.958
Gopher:
Well, good luck.

14:42.958 --> 14:45.125
I'll be waiting
when you give up.

14:46.583 --> 14:48.958
Now, this, Pooh Bear,
is a schedule,

14:48.958 --> 14:51.458
something
I am never without.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.708
If you follow it
faithfully,

14:53.708 --> 14:55.833
you'll be moving
faster than--

14:55.833 --> 14:59.125
well, whatever you choose
to move faster than.

14:59.125 --> 15:00.875
Oh, my.

15:00.875 --> 15:04.375
I've never seen anyone waste
so much time so quickly.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.166
You're getting him moving
faster, all right--

15:09.166 --> 15:11.166
slowly.

15:11.166 --> 15:13.125
The secret to not
being late, Pooh,

15:13.125 --> 15:14.416
is taking short cuts.

15:14.416 --> 15:17.125
And to do that, you find
the straight line

15:17.125 --> 15:19.458
which is the shortest
distance between two points.

15:19.458 --> 15:23.166
Between those points is
where I'll find enough time?

15:23.166 --> 15:24.625
Exactly, Pooh.

15:26.416 --> 15:27.583
Ouch!

15:27.583 --> 15:29.250
Is this one of the points

15:29.250 --> 15:30.833
I'm looking for, Piglet?

15:30.833 --> 15:34.625
Heh heh. No, Pooh.
That's a pine cone.

15:34.625 --> 15:37.875
Oh, dear. I don't think
this is going to work.

15:37.875 --> 15:40.416
I figured out
your problem, Pooh boy.

15:40.416 --> 15:42.000
You got no stripes.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.625
But, Tigger, how will
stripes make me faster?

15:46.625 --> 15:48.458
They'll make you faster

15:48.458 --> 15:50.000
because they're
racing stripes.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.583
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

15:52.708 --> 15:53.958
Hmm.

15:53.958 --> 15:55.500
I'm gonna have to
get a new brush.

15:55.500 --> 15:58.416
About ready to call it
quits, are you?

15:59.750 --> 16:01.958
Get yourselves ready

16:01.958 --> 16:05.458
for the new, improved,
faster Pooh Bear.

16:05.458 --> 16:07.458
Excuse me, Gopher,

16:07.458 --> 16:09.958
but what exactly
will I have to do?

16:09.958 --> 16:12.375
Not a single thing,
Pooh Bear.

16:12.375 --> 16:16.875
My fully automatic
solar-powered
woodgrain speeder upper

16:16.875 --> 16:18.208
is gonna do it for you.

16:18.208 --> 16:21.416
All you got to do
is, uh, go for it.

16:21.416 --> 16:24.083
Oh, bother!

16:24.083 --> 16:25.958
You did it! He's flying

16:25.958 --> 16:28.375
like no Poor bear
has flied before!

16:28.375 --> 16:32.083
I never thought I'd see
the day he moved like that.

16:32.083 --> 16:34.125
Oh, dear.

16:35.708 --> 16:38.000
The only thing
I don't understand

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
about this
not being slow business

16:41.000 --> 16:43.708
is when shall I ever
find time for lunch?

16:46.166 --> 16:49.083
Rabbit, do you think
Pooh's being so very fast

16:49.083 --> 16:51.000
is really such
a very good thing?

16:51.000 --> 16:54.583
Of course it isn't good.
It's wonderful.

16:54.583 --> 16:57.625
We've been trying to speed
that bear up forever.

17:04.708 --> 17:06.291
On the other hand...

17:07.458 --> 17:10.166
The new Pooh is
a menace to everyone.

17:10.166 --> 17:12.000
Don't be ridicorous.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.708
The only good pooh
is a fast pooh.

17:14.708 --> 17:17.125
But I wish
he wouldn't do that.

17:17.125 --> 17:20.166
What's everybody
complaining about?

17:20.166 --> 17:21.875
Pooh's perfect.

17:21.875 --> 17:25.166
He's the fastest bear on two--

17:29.333 --> 17:31.458
Missed us that time,
buddy bear!

17:31.458 --> 17:33.958
Back to the drawing
board, Gopher.

17:33.958 --> 17:36.833
Your perfect bear isn't.

17:36.833 --> 17:42.166
You ain't just whistling
"Dixie," sonny.

17:42.166 --> 17:46.583
This is positively,
absolutely guaranteed

17:46.583 --> 17:48.375
to slow him down.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
Let's see how that speed
demon handles Plan 2.

17:59.125 --> 18:01.000
But how will this
slow Pooh down?

18:02.333 --> 18:05.125
Uh, bear crosses bridge,

18:05.125 --> 18:06.583
bridge falls,

18:06.583 --> 18:08.375
bear drops into water.

18:08.375 --> 18:10.416
As simple as that.

18:12.833 --> 18:17.000
By dinghy, the
specifications
clearly state

18:17.000 --> 18:18.875
that the bridge should have--

18:18.875 --> 18:21.208
Aah!

18:22.333 --> 18:27.208
Now he's gonna get Plan 3.

18:27.208 --> 18:30.166
Soon as he hits this,
he'll--

18:31.250 --> 18:33.333
Ah, dagnabbit!

18:33.333 --> 18:37.583
There's just no
slowing that bear down.

18:37.583 --> 18:40.083
If we don't slow him
down, we'll have to..

18:40.083 --> 18:42.500
By dinghy, I got it!

18:44.875 --> 18:47.875
Beautiful day,
as days go.

18:47.875 --> 18:49.416
Birds in the trees,

18:49.416 --> 18:52.000
flowers here and there,

18:52.000 --> 18:54.875
not to mention one of those.

18:54.875 --> 18:56.375
Whoops!

19:03.583 --> 19:05.250
I'm sorry, Eeyore.

19:05.250 --> 19:07.708
I was trying
not to be late.

19:07.708 --> 19:10.875
Don't see why you're
in such a hurry.

19:10.875 --> 19:13.125
Sooner you get to a place,

19:13.125 --> 19:16.208
the sooner somebody
asks you to leave.

19:16.208 --> 19:18.125
Perhaps I should
ask the others

19:18.125 --> 19:22.000
where it is I should be
that I'm not.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.333
Mind if I tag along

19:24.333 --> 19:27.000
to find out what
you're talking about?

19:27.000 --> 19:29.166
What a good idea, Eeyore.

19:29.166 --> 19:31.583
And that way,
we can find out together.

19:31.583 --> 19:34.166
Only one thing to do,

19:34.166 --> 19:36.875
and that's
restore the balance.

19:36.875 --> 19:38.625
Restore the what?

19:38.625 --> 19:41.583
The balance. The natural
order of things.

19:41.583 --> 19:44.625
And just how do you
propose we do that?

19:44.625 --> 19:47.583
Easy. We can't
slow Pooh down,

19:47.583 --> 19:49.833
so we speed up.

19:49.833 --> 19:51.833
What a perspiring idea.

19:51.833 --> 19:54.083
Just what I'd expect
from a gopher.

19:54.083 --> 19:57.958
Hmm. I suppose
it might just work.

19:57.958 --> 20:01.833
From this second on, we do
everything double time.

20:01.833 --> 20:03.708
Better yet,
make that triple time.

20:03.708 --> 20:05.375
And we'll do it together

20:05.375 --> 20:08.333
to make sure
it gets done right.

20:08.333 --> 20:10.000
Must get the harvesting done.

20:11.458 --> 20:12.833
Have to plan for winter.

20:12.833 --> 20:15.000
Time to plant new crops.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
I must finish
my spring cleaning.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.333
There. All done.

20:18.333 --> 20:19.958
Now for next year's.

20:19.958 --> 20:21.958
Mustn't wait
till the last minute.

20:21.958 --> 20:23.458
Gopher:
Got to get new tunnels dug.

20:23.458 --> 20:25.291
No time to dawdle.

20:25.291 --> 20:28.625
Got to get
on Pooh Standard Time.

20:28.625 --> 20:29.750
Aah!

20:29.750 --> 20:31.166
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

20:31.166 --> 20:33.000
I'm gonna have
to bounce my tail off

20:33.000 --> 20:34.708
to be as fast
as buddy bear.

20:34.708 --> 20:36.625
Um, Tigger.

20:38.333 --> 20:39.875
I know I'm late
for something

20:39.875 --> 20:43.125
--
I always am.

20:43.125 --> 20:45.500
If I don't remember
what it is soon,

20:45.500 --> 20:48.375
I shall very likely
be late for being late.

20:48.375 --> 20:53.000
Don't know how much longer
I can...keep up this pace.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.708
Uh, Rabbit--

20:54.708 --> 20:57.625
I'm afraid very small
animals such as myself

20:57.625 --> 20:59.458
get tired
rather quickly.

21:01.333 --> 21:03.333
Excuse me, Piglet.

21:05.708 --> 21:11.375
I can't tunnel another...
inch at this speed.

21:11.375 --> 21:14.458
I don't think I can
bounce another bounce.

21:14.458 --> 21:18.250
I think I
have missed something
very, very important.

21:18.250 --> 21:22.375
Hello, everyone.
I'm sorry for being late.

21:22.375 --> 21:25.708
Why, Pooh, you are.
You're late.

21:29.458 --> 21:31.833
We don't have
to hurry anymore.

21:31.833 --> 21:34.750
But aren't you all
angry with me?

21:34.750 --> 21:37.750
No. Because
not being on time

21:37.750 --> 21:40.000
is right on time
for a pooh bear.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.458
Does that mean
I'm on time

21:42.458 --> 21:46.208
for whatever it is
I'm not on time for?

21:46.208 --> 21:47.750
Precisely.

21:47.750 --> 21:51.000
You can take your time
for all the time you want.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.750
You're not late, Pooh.
You're just Pooh.

21:54.750 --> 21:56.750
Yes. Now I see.

21:56.750 --> 21:59.250
If being late
means being me,

21:59.250 --> 22:01.375
then that's
what I shall be,

22:01.375 --> 22:05.125
so long as it doesn't mean
being late for breakfast.

22:45.833 --> 22:49.375
Winnie the Pooh Bear

22:51.416 --> 22:52.875
take me, please?

22:52.875 --> 22:56.291
I got to be there

22:58.250 --> 23:03.208
Winnie the Pooh
