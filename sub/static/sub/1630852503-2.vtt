Peripheral edema.

36:06.729 --> 36:08.122
GRIFF:
Due to reduced
systolic function.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.123
Great minds.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.211
I presume you ordered
a diuretic.

36:10.255 --> 36:11.604
And a vasodilator.

36:11.647 --> 36:13.083
But what we really need is...A DNA test.

JOEY: What is going on?The baby's sister.

36:14.955 --> 36:16.478
The reason she doesn't like
to wear shoes.

36:16.522 --> 36:17.740
It's a symptom.

Wait, of the same disease
her brother has?

36:19.177 --> 36:20.961
Less severe, of course,
but two siblings

36:21.004 --> 36:22.310
with the same genetic disorder?Yes.

36:22.354 --> 36:23.964
That's a sample size
we can work with.

36:24.007 --> 36:25.139
We can map the genomes.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.010
Find the mutations.And fix it.

36:27.054 --> 36:28.708
Well...We need a DNA test right away.

If we're right,

36:30.013 --> 36:31.101
this could change
everything for them.

36:31.145 --> 36:32.190
Yeah.

36:32.233 --> 36:34.235
I was wrong
to dismiss gene therapy

36:34.279 --> 36:35.671
and to undermine you.

36:35.715 --> 36:37.107
This is your department,

Mm...

Single knots.

Double knots, and I even
threw in some granny knots.
