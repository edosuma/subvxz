WEBVTT

00:03.284 --> 00:04.749
I really want us to be friends.

00:04.817 --> 00:08.117
You and Ricky--byou're not thinking
of getting married, are you?

00:08.185 --> 00:11.185
He went to New York this weekend
and didn't even tell me that he was going.

00:11.252 --> 00:13.185
Come back tomorrow morning
with a new attitude

00:13.253 --> 00:15.086
before I give you
your walking papers.

00:15.153 --> 00:18.386
I spent the night with Jessie
over at Jack's guest house.

00:18.454 --> 00:19.586
You lied?

00:19.654 --> 00:21.720
You are on restriction
for the summer.

00:21.788 --> 00:24.621
You're not gonna see Jack anymore,
and that is it.

00:24.689 --> 00:26.422
Do you really think
you're in love with Amy?

00:26.490 --> 00:28.989
I might wanna find that out
before she's in love with someone else.

00:29.057 --> 00:31.991
Your dad and I are getting married again
as soon as Amy gets back.

00:32.058 --> 00:34.625
Amy didn't tell you anything
about New York. I know she didn't.

00:34.693 --> 00:36.859
I'm just gonna marry Adrian
and get it over with.

00:36.927 --> 00:39.627
You got angry with Ricky and
 got yourself fired from the job,

00:39.695 --> 00:40.828
and now you wanna get married.

00:40.895 --> 00:42.328
How's your marriage going?

00:42.396 --> 00:43.695
Maybe I'll call your office.

00:43.763 --> 00:45.663
I don't wanna have sex.

00:45.731 --> 00:48.164
It may be a little early in the relationship
to have sex.

00:48.232 --> 00:50.698
What would happen
if we got engaged?

00:50.766 --> 00:52.766
What would happen if Amy 
and Ricky thought that we were gonna be

00:52.834 --> 00:54.633
unavailable to them
for the rest of our lives?

00:57.602 --> 01:00.203
Happy birthday, Amy.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.006
Good morning.

01:07.074 --> 01:08.640
What are you doing here
so early?

01:08.708 --> 01:10.641
Oh, nothing.
Just wanted to talk.

01:10.709 --> 01:12.642
Make sure we're okay.
We're okay.

01:12.710 --> 01:14.643
Yeah? You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:14.711 --> 01:16.344
How's Peter?

01:16.412 --> 01:18.412
Peter is-- He's great.

01:18.480 --> 01:20.080
But it's a new relationship,

01:20.148 --> 01:23.081
so I don't wanna get
too familiar too fast.

01:23.149 --> 01:25.416
And I thought maybe you and I
could hang out together today.

01:25.484 --> 01:27.851
Go get some breakfast or make 
some breakfast or something.

01:27.918 --> 01:30.652
Look, do me a favor. Call Peter 
and go over and hang out with him.

01:30.720 --> 01:33.721
I'll be fine here alone.

01:33.788 --> 01:35.388
I like being alone.

01:35.456 --> 01:38.523
You like being alone, or you like 
spending time with Ricky?

01:38.591 --> 01:40.858
No, I don't like
spending time with Ricky.

01:40.926 --> 01:43.626
And I don't even like spending 
time with you, so call Peter.

01:45.828 --> 01:48.629
Okay.

01:53.300 --> 01:54.733
It's Griffin.

01:54.801 --> 01:56.201
Yay.

01:56.268 --> 01:57.235
Hi.

01:57.303 --> 01:58.502
Hi. What are you doing?

01:58.570 --> 02:00.670
Just hanging out with Hailey.
What are you doing?

02:00.738 --> 02:02.371
Hanging out with Ashley.

02:02.439 --> 02:03.572
You wanna hang out?

02:03.640 --> 02:06.540
With you and Hailey
and me and Ashley?

02:06.608 --> 02:08.208
No. No.

02:08.276 --> 02:11.477
<i>Well, how about
just you and me?</i>

02:11.545 --> 02:12.878
All right.

02:12.946 --> 02:14.645
All right.
You wanna come over to my house?

02:14.713 --> 02:16.046
Why don't you
come over to my house?

02:16.114 --> 02:18.215
All right. All right.
I'll call you when I get there.

02:18.283 --> 02:19.883
I'll see you.

02:21.418 --> 02:22.684
Who's he with?

02:22.752 --> 02:24.319
Ashley.

02:24.386 --> 02:25.786
Amy's sister.

02:25.854 --> 02:27.321
Amy had a baby
with Ricky.

02:27.388 --> 02:30.489
Oh, right. Got it.
I remember the story.

02:37.696 --> 02:39.630
Yeah, it's me.
Leave a message.

02:39.697 --> 02:41.765
Hey, it's me.

02:41.832 --> 02:45.501
Me. Um,
I wanna talk to you.

02:45.569 --> 02:47.770
I don't know what
you were doing on my birthday,

02:47.837 --> 02:49.805
but I wasn't
doing anything, and...

02:49.872 --> 02:52.306
You know what? If I was hoping
 that people would remember my birthday,

02:52.374 --> 02:55.176
I should've said something,
but it honestly didn't seem

02:55.243 --> 02:57.177
that important
to me this year.

02:57.245 --> 03:00.579
Being able to come here
to this program is what was important.

03:00.647 --> 03:04.248
And now what's important is for us 
to have a chance, so call me.

03:04.316 --> 03:06.650
Please. Please,
please call me.

03:06.718 --> 03:10.586
No matter what you did
on my birthday, call me.

03:10.654 --> 03:13.521
Not that you did anything,
but...

03:13.589 --> 03:17.723
I-I-I'm not accusing you
of doing anything. I...

03:17.791 --> 03:20.359
Um, I totally messed this up.

03:20.427 --> 03:22.494
Uh, bye.

03:22.562 --> 03:24.930
Oh. Hi, John.
It's Mommy.

03:24.998 --> 03:26.431
I'm gonna be home
in a few days.

03:26.499 --> 03:27.966
I love you.

03:28.034 --> 03:31.869
That-- That was for John--
the "I love you."

03:31.937 --> 03:33.937
Um, anyway, bye.

<i>No matter what you did
on my birthday, call me.</i>

04:02.301 --> 04:03.601
Good morning.

04:03.669 --> 04:05.769
We forgot Amy's birthday,
you know.

04:05.837 --> 04:08.538
What? Oh, well.
Mom probably sent her something.

04:08.606 --> 04:11.074
Sent who something?
Who sent what where?

04:11.142 --> 04:12.708
We missed Amy's birthday.

04:12.776 --> 04:15.441
No, we didn't.
Amy's birthday was...

04:15.508 --> 04:17.975
Is when?
- Yesterday.

04:19.510 --> 04:21.810
That can't be right.
I think that's right.

04:21.878 --> 04:24.780
How could we forget
our own daughter's birthday?

04:24.847 --> 04:26.547
Out of sight,
out of mind?

04:26.615 --> 04:29.283
Nice. You couldn't tell us
it was your sister's birthday?

04:29.351 --> 04:30.784
He's the one who told me.

04:30.852 --> 04:32.719
Amy's the one who told me.
I forgot, too.

04:32.787 --> 04:34.487
Actually, I'm not sure
I even knew,

04:34.554 --> 04:36.055
which is really pathetic.

04:36.122 --> 04:38.056
We need a plan.
No, we don't need a plan.

04:38.124 --> 04:40.725
We need to apologize.
I can't believe this.

04:40.793 --> 04:43.327
We were so excited about telling her
that we were getting remarried again

04:43.395 --> 04:46.429
that we forgot why we got married
in the first place.

04:46.497 --> 04:47.730
You didn't know?

04:47.798 --> 04:49.365
I don't need to know.

04:49.433 --> 04:51.733
Well, she'll be home next week.
We can make it up to her.

04:51.801 --> 04:54.302
I feel so bad about this.

04:54.370 --> 04:58.271
Everyone forgot my 16th birthday
and it stayed with me my whole life.

04:58.339 --> 05:00.806
She called me this morning
and left a message.

05:00.874 --> 05:02.574
She said her birthday
just wasn't important.

05:02.642 --> 05:05.143
She says that's what's important
is that she got to go to New York,

05:05.211 --> 05:07.579
and I think she really is
grateful for that.

05:07.646 --> 05:09.514
Oh, really?

05:09.581 --> 05:11.549
We'll do something for her
when she gets back, right?

05:11.616 --> 05:14.250
She'll be back in a few days.
Okay, but let's call her from the car.

05:14.318 --> 05:16.418
Yeah.
Can you listen out
for Robie?

05:16.486 --> 05:18.687
Your dad needs to take me
to the car dealership.

05:18.755 --> 05:20.222
I'm having car problems.

05:20.289 --> 05:21.924
See you.

05:24.226 --> 05:26.227
I can listen out for Robie
until they get back.

05:26.295 --> 05:29.196
Yeah, okay. You can listen out
for him and for John

05:29.264 --> 05:31.665
until Amy gets back
for all I care.

05:31.733 --> 05:33.933
But then you'll be going,
and before you go,

05:34.001 --> 05:37.171
I just wanna say that it's been 
nice having you here with us.

05:37.238 --> 05:39.445
And thanks for the kiss.
It taught me a lot.

05:39.513 --> 05:41.550
Like what?

05:41.618 --> 05:43.952
Like just because someone's sexually
attracted to you

05:44.020 --> 05:46.390
doesn't mean
they really love you.

05:46.458 --> 05:49.726
It just means
they wanna have sex with you.

05:49.794 --> 05:52.362
Or, in this case,
that they just wanna kiss you.

05:52.429 --> 05:55.230
How do I get blamed for that kiss?
You know you...

05:56.999 --> 06:00.201
Never mind.
It was my fault.

06:00.269 --> 06:02.202
I wanted to kiss you,
and I kissed you.

06:02.270 --> 06:05.071
Oh, the truth for once.

06:15.481 --> 06:18.482
Hey, Dr. Fields. I need to make an appointment.
It's, uh--

06:18.550 --> 06:22.419
<i>It's not an emergency.
I just wanna talk to you.</i>

06:22.487 --> 06:24.654
Oh, hey,
thanks for coming.

06:24.722 --> 06:26.923
Can I make you a cup of coffee?
It'll only take a minute.

06:26.990 --> 06:30.626
Uh, no. I'm not
drinking coffee these days.

06:30.693 --> 06:33.461
Water. Can I get you
a glass of water?

06:33.529 --> 06:35.429
No, thank you.

06:35.497 --> 06:37.697
No coffee, no water.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.632
This is not a session,
Ken, okay?

06:39.699 --> 06:41.966
I just agreed to talk.

06:42.034 --> 06:45.635
You wanna sit down,
or should we just talk standing,

06:45.703 --> 06:48.906
without coffee or water
so it doesn't look like a session?

06:51.308 --> 06:53.442
Okay.

06:56.846 --> 07:00.247
So, what's this all about?

07:00.315 --> 07:02.415
It's about...

07:03.818 --> 07:05.752
I can't stand your husband.

07:13.926 --> 07:17.261
Um, neither can I.

07:17.328 --> 07:19.397
Seriously?

07:20.666 --> 07:23.133
Seriously.

07:23.201 --> 07:27.136
But that doesn't mean that I'm going
to dump him and go back with you.

07:30.706 --> 07:32.941
It doesn't mean
that I won't either.

07:44.423 --> 07:45.356
Yeah?

07:45.424 --> 07:47.993
Good morning.
Why is that?

07:48.061 --> 07:50.128
Why is this a good morning?

07:50.196 --> 07:52.630
Something happen since yesterday
that I don't know about?

07:52.698 --> 07:56.334
Yesterday was just
a bad, bad day overall.

07:56.401 --> 07:59.002
So I thought I'd go back down
to the butcher shop

07:59.070 --> 08:01.904
and make my apologies to Bunny
and see if I can't get my job back.

08:01.972 --> 08:05.207
You think that's what people do
when they get fired or lose their job?

08:05.275 --> 08:06.841
They just show up
and apologize?

08:06.909 --> 08:09.777
People don't just show up
after they've been fired.

08:09.844 --> 08:13.013
I mean, who shows up
at a place of business
after they've been fired?

08:13.081 --> 08:15.050
The owner's son?

08:15.118 --> 08:18.154
Not funny.
Go get another job.

08:22.092 --> 08:24.559
Something else
this good morning?

08:24.627 --> 08:25.860
Well...

08:25.928 --> 08:29.030
Well, what?

08:29.097 --> 08:32.765
You know how you said that if
I wanted to get engaged, go ahead?

08:32.833 --> 08:35.768
That's what I said,
but that's not what I meant.

08:35.836 --> 08:37.570
What I meant
was don't get engaged.

08:37.638 --> 08:39.405
I was daring you
to get engaged.

08:39.472 --> 08:42.941
Well, I take that dare.

08:43.009 --> 08:44.609
I think Adrian and I
should get engaged.

08:44.677 --> 08:46.411
Not married, just engaged.

08:46.478 --> 08:49.080
If you're getting engaged,
you're gonna get married.

08:49.147 --> 08:51.048
If you're not getting married,
don't get engaged.

08:51.116 --> 08:54.217
I think it'd be good for Adrian
to put a ring on her finger.

08:54.285 --> 08:56.152
I mean, she's gonna
be showing soon,

08:56.220 --> 08:58.321
and I think it'll be nice,
especially for her,

08:58.388 --> 09:00.322
if people think
that we're engaged.

09:00.390 --> 09:02.858
What people?
Ricky and Amy people?

09:04.060 --> 09:06.995
No. No, not just
Amy and Ricky.

09:07.062 --> 09:09.263
All people, one and all.

09:09.331 --> 09:11.098
You heard what I said, right?

09:11.166 --> 09:12.933
Yes, I did.
I heard.

09:24.944 --> 09:25.877
Hey.

09:27.313 --> 09:29.080
Gosh.

09:29.148 --> 09:31.549
Oh, he's in a bad mood,

09:31.617 --> 09:33.484
your father.

09:33.552 --> 09:36.586
I mean, a really,
really bad mood.

09:36.654 --> 09:38.088
What's going on?

09:38.156 --> 09:41.657
I told him I wanted
to give a ring to Adrian.

09:41.725 --> 09:43.592
An engagement ring.

09:43.660 --> 09:45.828
Not that I'm gonna marry her.
I just...

09:45.895 --> 09:49.264
I want to give her a ring
because I want people to think...

09:49.332 --> 09:50.265
we're...

09:50.332 --> 09:51.599
Pregnant?

09:53.001 --> 09:55.669
You don't need
a ring for that.

09:55.737 --> 09:58.772
I mean, she's gonna
be showing soon.

09:58.839 --> 10:01.841
I mean, if you wanna
give her a ring just to give her a ring,

10:01.909 --> 10:04.143
then do what your dad
did for me

10:04.211 --> 10:06.846
and get her
a real gigantic one.

10:06.913 --> 10:11.316
You know, give her
the biggest ring you can find.

10:11.384 --> 10:12.984
Look at mine.

10:13.052 --> 10:15.953
This ring
makes me so happy.

10:16.021 --> 10:18.455
And you know what?
If your father ever dies,

10:18.523 --> 10:22.292
I can sell it, and, well, I can probably 
live off it the rest of my life.

10:22.359 --> 10:25.628
I don't think so, Betty.
It's a big ring, but...

10:25.695 --> 10:27.296
Anyway, you wouldn't
have to sell it.

10:27.364 --> 10:29.298
I'm sure my dad's taken care
of you in his will.

10:29.365 --> 10:30.498
He has a will?

10:30.566 --> 10:32.300
Well, of course he has a will.

10:32.368 --> 10:35.303
Ben, that's terrible news.

10:35.371 --> 10:37.505
A will is like a curse,
you know?

10:37.572 --> 10:40.674
You sign the will and--
and then you die.

10:40.741 --> 10:43.242
That's not true.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.344
I-- I mean, it is, but--

10:45.412 --> 10:46.678
Did your mother have a will?

10:46.746 --> 10:48.814
Yes, I'm sure she did.
See?

10:48.881 --> 10:50.382
Betty, you should
have a will.

10:50.449 --> 10:53.684
If you don't have a will,
then when you pass away,

10:53.752 --> 10:55.353
everything you own
will be held in probate.

10:55.420 --> 10:58.188
The little
that I have left, I...

10:58.256 --> 11:00.190
Well, I keep it hidden

11:00.257 --> 11:02.191
in a fake book in here.

11:02.259 --> 11:04.326
See, I used to keep it
in my bathroom.

11:04.394 --> 11:08.497
But then I came in, you know,
and I saw the library,

11:08.564 --> 11:11.065
and I just thought, "Oh, my God, 
this would be so much better."

11:11.133 --> 11:13.534
You know, 'cause of all
the books and everything.

11:13.602 --> 11:15.002
Yeah.

11:15.070 --> 11:16.837
Does my dad know about this?

11:16.904 --> 11:19.972
No. No, I didn't tell him.

11:20.040 --> 11:23.609
You know, just in case that
I had to leave the house in a hurry.

11:23.677 --> 11:24.610
But look.

11:27.446 --> 11:30.982
If I die,
all of this is yours.

11:31.049 --> 11:33.717
See? I don't need
no stinking will.

11:33.785 --> 11:35.519
That's very generous,
Betty,

11:35.587 --> 11:37.921
but I'm sure that you have
some friends or family

11:37.989 --> 11:40.056
you'd like to leave
this to, and...

11:40.124 --> 11:41.857
Besides...

11:41.925 --> 11:46.028
That is a very nice
and very large sapphire.

11:46.096 --> 11:48.296
It was given to me
by a count.

11:48.364 --> 11:51.566
You know, it's kind of like royalty,
only it's a count.

11:51.633 --> 11:55.202
I don't need a ring from a count
when I already have a ring from a king.

11:55.270 --> 11:56.370
It's real?

11:56.437 --> 11:59.706
It's real,
and I want you to have it.

11:59.774 --> 12:02.742
I want you to take this ring right now
before I die.

12:02.809 --> 12:05.377
Take it, and I want you
to give it to Adrian.

12:05.445 --> 12:07.613
And I don't care
if you marry her or not.

12:07.680 --> 12:09.581
I love Adrian.
I want her to have it.

12:09.649 --> 12:11.883
And she's gonna have
a little Boykewich.

12:11.951 --> 12:14.118
Or, you know, a Girlkewich.

12:14.186 --> 12:16.954
You know? Get it?
A Girlkewich.

12:17.022 --> 12:19.389
Oh, gosh.
I love words, you know?

12:19.457 --> 12:22.558
If I hadn't ended up being a hooker,
I'd probably be a writer.

12:22.626 --> 12:24.227
You are quite the wordsmith.

12:24.294 --> 12:26.595
Oh, I want you
to take that ring.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.263
That's very generous,

12:28.331 --> 12:31.399
but I'm not sure that Adrian
would give it back, so...

12:31.467 --> 12:34.135
No, I insist.
I'm a member of this family.

12:34.203 --> 12:37.404
I'm the wife to your father,
and I'm your stepmom.

12:37.472 --> 12:39.339
And I want you
to take that ring,

12:39.407 --> 12:41.541
and I want you
to give it to Adrian,

12:41.609 --> 12:43.643
because, you know,
if you get a girl pregnant,

12:43.711 --> 12:45.511
I think you should
give her a gift,

12:45.579 --> 12:48.413
even if it's worth
more than the baby.

13:00.196 --> 13:03.064
Hey, Mr. Cooperstein.
Hi, Jack.

13:03.132 --> 13:05.499
Bye, Jack.
Oh, I'm not here
to see Madison.

13:05.567 --> 13:07.834
I know that,
'cause you can't see Madison.

13:07.902 --> 13:10.803
You and Madison need to take a break.
Maybe a permanent break.

13:10.871 --> 13:13.506
Could we talk about that?
I don't really like to talk.

13:13.573 --> 13:15.007
Me neither.
I'm a man of action.

13:15.075 --> 13:17.843
Yeah, that's what bothers me--
the action.

13:17.910 --> 13:20.745
What I meant was
I came over here to show you

13:20.813 --> 13:22.747
that I really do care
about your daughter,

13:22.815 --> 13:25.516
and even though it's hard
to talk about what happened,

13:25.584 --> 13:27.651
I was hoping
we could talk about it,

13:27.719 --> 13:30.186
because I really wanna keep
seeing Madison.

13:30.254 --> 13:32.355
I really do love her.

13:32.422 --> 13:35.524
I think we're good together, and we 
bring out the best qualities in each other.

13:35.592 --> 13:37.994
That is such a crock.

13:38.061 --> 13:40.329
My wife told me what you two
have been doing together,

13:40.397 --> 13:41.831
and then you took it
one step too far

13:41.899 --> 13:44.033
by trying to sleep
with my daughter in your new,

13:44.101 --> 13:47.103
unsupervised,
parentless guest house,

13:47.170 --> 13:48.938
and then you two
lied about it.

13:49.006 --> 13:51.674
True, but we were just sleeping,
and not even in the same bed.

13:51.742 --> 13:53.376
Maybe not.

13:53.443 --> 13:56.011
But why would you two be sleeping 
in the same guest house together

13:56.079 --> 13:59.048
unless you two were planning
on doing something that you shouldn't be doing?

13:59.115 --> 14:02.384
You know, you're actually really good at 
talking for someone that doesn't like to talk.

14:02.452 --> 14:05.087
Jack, I think
we finished talking.

14:05.155 --> 14:08.056
Please. Please let us
go out again.

14:08.124 --> 14:10.659
There's gotta be something I can say
that'll change your mind

14:10.726 --> 14:12.527
or something I can do
or not do.

14:12.595 --> 14:13.862
Yeah, stay away
from Madison.

14:15.131 --> 14:17.466
Don't call or e-mail
or text or tweet.

14:17.534 --> 14:20.303
And if you can not do that
for the whole summer,

14:20.370 --> 14:23.006
I might let you go out with her again
when school starts,

14:23.073 --> 14:25.174
provided that you two
stop doing

14:25.242 --> 14:27.277
what you're doing
in regard to--

14:27.344 --> 14:29.579
Oral. Right. Got it.

14:29.647 --> 14:32.048
What did you just say?
Um, I said,

14:32.115 --> 14:33.916
"Oh, right. Got it."

14:33.983 --> 14:35.250
No, you didn't.

14:35.318 --> 14:36.551
Yes, I did.

14:44.659 --> 14:46.726
Madison?

14:46.793 --> 14:50.697
Madison Mildred Cooperstein!

14:50.764 --> 14:52.699
What are you
screaming for?

14:52.766 --> 14:54.567
Yeah, Dad.
What are you screaming for?

14:54.635 --> 14:57.438
Did you use my middle name?
You know I hate my middle name. Mildred?

14:57.505 --> 15:01.612
I am screaming because--
because--

15:01.679 --> 15:02.746
What?

15:02.814 --> 15:04.748
You said that they were just
fooling around.

15:04.816 --> 15:07.050
Like, fooling around, like...

15:08.518 --> 15:12.121
making out,
like teenage stuff.

15:12.189 --> 15:14.057
Good work.

15:14.125 --> 15:15.659
Yes, that's what I said.

15:15.726 --> 15:17.661
Well, apparently
you left a lot out.

15:17.729 --> 15:19.330
A key word even.

15:19.397 --> 15:21.498
A word that I just heard
from Jack.

15:21.566 --> 15:24.568
Oh, did he come over here to talk to you?
He said he was gonna.

15:24.636 --> 15:26.937
He talked to me, all right.

15:27.004 --> 15:28.805
Oral sex?

15:28.873 --> 15:30.506
Aahh!

15:30.574 --> 15:32.474
Jack said that?

15:32.542 --> 15:35.010
He said that.
He said that to you?

15:35.077 --> 15:37.879
Was waterboarding involved?
Did you do something to make him say that?

15:37.947 --> 15:39.347
He would never say that.
Never.

15:39.415 --> 15:40.949
Not even if it were true?

15:43.219 --> 15:45.253
You knew?

15:47.857 --> 15:49.625
I'm an idiot.

15:49.693 --> 15:51.327
Yes, sometimes you are.

15:51.395 --> 15:53.663
I told Madison's father
what kind of sex we have.

15:53.730 --> 15:57.532
Wow, that is a whole
new level of idiocy.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.334
So he didn't know?
Of course he didn't know.

15:59.402 --> 16:01.169
Why would you tell him?
I thought he knew.

16:01.237 --> 16:03.704
You thought Madison
told her father

16:03.772 --> 16:06.506
that you two do what you do,
and he was still letting you go out with her?

16:06.574 --> 16:09.009
Yeah. It's not like
we're having real sex.

16:09.076 --> 16:12.379
Mmm, no, it's not.
We had real sex.

16:12.447 --> 16:14.381
Yeah. And I would think
that parents

16:14.448 --> 16:16.383
would care less about
that sex than real sex.

16:16.450 --> 16:19.553
Mmm, I wouldn't
think that. No.

16:19.620 --> 16:21.822
Because you don't like doing that.
With you.

16:21.889 --> 16:24.191
What? Why'd you say that?

16:24.258 --> 16:26.025
Because.

16:26.093 --> 16:27.927
Don't tell me you
and that Grant guy

16:27.994 --> 16:29.862
are already doing
what we didn't do.

16:29.930 --> 16:31.964
Well, I wouldn't tell you,

16:32.032 --> 16:34.400
because if I did tell you,
you might tell somebody.

16:34.467 --> 16:36.335
Discretion was never
one of your better qualities.

16:36.403 --> 16:38.470
Hi, Jack.
Hi.

16:38.538 --> 16:40.872
Bye, Grace.

16:42.909 --> 16:44.709
Oh. What was that about?

16:44.777 --> 16:47.546
I don't know.
Jack's, like, jealous or something.

16:47.613 --> 16:50.382
Jealous of Grant?
Yeah.

16:50.450 --> 16:53.218
Grace, you and Grant
aren't having sex, are you?

16:53.286 --> 16:56.954
You just met him.
I know. No, we're not.

16:57.022 --> 16:59.924
But I'm thinking
about it, though.

16:59.992 --> 17:02.160
Not like sex sex,

17:02.227 --> 17:04.095
but, you know,
the kind of sex

17:04.162 --> 17:06.064
that doesn't require
any birth control.

17:06.132 --> 17:09.300
Oh. But I thought you--

17:09.367 --> 17:10.835
I think
I might like it now.

17:10.903 --> 17:13.905
Well, join the club.

17:13.973 --> 17:15.440
There are clubs?
No.

17:15.508 --> 17:17.442
Oh, okay.
I didn't think so.

17:17.510 --> 17:20.244
I mean, I'm not completely
naive about these things.

17:20.313 --> 17:22.247
Maybe you are, honey.

17:22.315 --> 17:24.148
I mean,
that kind of sex--

17:24.215 --> 17:26.251
Is a good substitute
for going all the way?

17:26.318 --> 17:27.752
Not a substitute, no.

17:27.819 --> 17:30.922
It's more like...gateway sex.

17:30.990 --> 17:32.457
"Gateway sex"?

17:32.525 --> 17:34.793
Mm-hmm. Gateway.
It's sex that leads to other sex.

17:34.860 --> 17:38.229
Well, Jack and Madison have been 
doing that for, like, a year,

17:38.296 --> 17:39.730
and they haven't done
anything else.

17:39.798 --> 17:41.765
All right.
Well, it can lead to sex,

17:41.833 --> 17:44.134
and I think many people
would consider it foreplay.

17:44.202 --> 17:47.671
So I don't want you
to have gateway sex.

17:47.739 --> 17:50.074
I don't want you
to have sex at all, honey.

17:50.142 --> 17:53.011
I think you're still too young.
And like I said,
you just met this guy.

17:53.078 --> 17:54.679
But, Mom,
I really like him,

17:54.747 --> 17:56.314
and we have
so much fun together.

17:56.382 --> 17:58.684
Grace, you do realize

17:58.751 --> 18:01.019
there's risks
with gateway sex.

18:01.087 --> 18:05.156
I mean, you can get sexually transmitted infections
from gateway sex.

18:05.224 --> 18:07.325
Are you just trying to ruin this for me
so I won't do it?

18:07.393 --> 18:09.427
No, I'm not trying
to ruin this for you.

18:09.494 --> 18:11.562
I'm just trying to make you aware
so that you don't end up

18:11.629 --> 18:14.464
with a lifetime of problems
from one night

18:14.532 --> 18:16.466
of fun with some guy
you're just getting to know.

18:16.534 --> 18:18.502
Okay, that is something
to think about.

18:18.569 --> 18:19.503
Yeah.

18:19.570 --> 18:21.605
Unfortunately.
But just so you know,

18:21.672 --> 18:23.840
I never even
went off the pill,

18:23.908 --> 18:25.676
just in case the gate

18:25.743 --> 18:27.944
ever unexpectedly swings open.

18:28.012 --> 18:29.946
All right.
Well, why don't you think about

18:30.014 --> 18:32.148
leaving the gate closed
for a while longer?

18:33.484 --> 18:35.751
Keep the gate closed
and locked.

18:40.624 --> 18:41.991
Dr. Attavi?

18:42.059 --> 18:43.826
Adrian, this is Dr. Miller.

18:43.894 --> 18:45.695
I'm an associate
of Dr. Attavi's.

18:45.763 --> 18:48.498
He said you were experiencing
some problems and asked me to give you a call.

18:48.565 --> 18:50.366
He's just passing me off
to some other guy?

18:50.434 --> 18:53.169
I'm not just a guy.
I'm an OB-GYN.

18:53.236 --> 18:54.503
Yeah, whatever.
Where is he?

18:54.570 --> 18:56.171
He's with a mom right now

18:56.238 --> 18:58.339
who's having
a complicated delivery,

18:58.407 --> 19:00.508
so he's not gonna be
available for a while.

19:00.576 --> 19:03.177
But we do work out of the same hospital,
so if you wanna

19:03.245 --> 19:05.212
come down
to the emergency room,

19:05.280 --> 19:07.881
I could take a look at you and the baby
and see what's going on.

19:07.949 --> 19:09.982
No, that's okay.
I'll wait for Dr. Attavi.

19:10.050 --> 19:12.251
Yeah, he doesn't think
you should wait.

19:12.319 --> 19:14.186
He thinks
you should come down now.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.121
We just wanna make sure
you and the baby are okay.

19:24.171 --> 19:26.272
Ah, revenge then.

19:26.339 --> 19:28.807
MI
No, it wasn't revenge.

19:28.875 --> 19:31.509
Okay. What would you
say it was?

19:32.811 --> 19:35.479
I don't know.
Just me being me.

19:35.547 --> 19:36.947
That's your excuse?

19:37.015 --> 19:38.849
Hey, nobody's perfect.

19:38.917 --> 19:41.284
Is that how you're gonna
explain it to Amy?

19:41.352 --> 19:43.686
Do I have to
explain it to her?

19:43.754 --> 19:44.821
No.

19:44.888 --> 19:46.356
I don't?

19:46.423 --> 19:48.858
AB
I wouldn't.

19:48.925 --> 19:51.728
You may be taking one step forward
and two steps back,

19:51.795 --> 19:54.631
but even two steps back,
I think you're way past

19:54.699 --> 19:56.300
running from commitments.

19:56.368 --> 19:58.569
I actually think you may
be ready to make a commitment.

19:58.637 --> 20:02.206
I just said I slept with another woman
after telling Amy I wouldn't.

20:02.273 --> 20:05.408
Okay. You're not ready yet,
but you're on your way.

20:05.476 --> 20:07.376
I know you pretty well,

20:07.444 --> 20:10.347
and I know you can do
whatever you set your mind to.

20:10.415 --> 20:13.988
I'm no good at not having sex.
You know that.

20:15.425 --> 20:16.694
I need sex.

20:18.430 --> 20:21.701
You need sex,
or you need to feel loved?

20:21.769 --> 20:23.304
Are we back to that?

20:23.372 --> 20:24.905
We keep coming back to that.

20:24.973 --> 20:26.941
Yeah, over and over,

20:27.009 --> 20:28.911
until you get
the right answer.

20:28.979 --> 20:31.750
The answer then
makes you happy.

20:35.023 --> 20:37.558
We're gonna have to stop
right there.

20:37.625 --> 20:39.926
But I wanna continue
this conversation tomorrow.

20:39.994 --> 20:41.962
Can you come back
tomorrow?

20:42.030 --> 20:43.430
Yeah, I guess.

20:43.498 --> 20:44.932
Yeah.

20:46.702 --> 20:48.603
Oh. I'm going.

20:48.670 --> 20:51.038
I apologize,
but I have another appointment.

20:51.105 --> 20:53.206
All right.
I'll be back tomorrow.

21:02.250 --> 21:05.819
Jeez, I should've just talked
to you last night.

21:05.887 --> 21:07.187
He's not gonna
say anything.

21:07.255 --> 21:09.788
Whatever.

21:09.856 --> 21:12.057
So, how does this work?

21:13.627 --> 21:16.930
Just like the bar we were at last night,
but no drinks.

21:24.572 --> 21:29.242
So, tell me,
what's going on with Betty?

21:31.211 --> 21:32.810
Well, nothing really.

21:32.877 --> 21:34.477
I mean, she's good-- Betty.

21:34.545 --> 21:36.907
I love her. I really do.

21:36.975 --> 21:39.935
Just maybe not as much
as I thought I did,

21:40.003 --> 21:41.469
that's all.

21:41.537 --> 21:44.305
I think it might be just one of those things,
you know?

21:44.373 --> 21:46.740
Honeymoon-is-over things.

21:46.808 --> 21:50.410
And now that we're settling
into our day-to-day lives,

21:50.478 --> 21:54.614
I just feel
a little...irritated.

21:54.682 --> 21:56.482
In general
or something in particular?

21:56.550 --> 21:58.484
It's a little thing.
It's stupid.

21:58.552 --> 22:00.185
I don't even know why
I bring it up.

22:00.253 --> 22:01.987
Because it bothers you.

22:02.054 --> 22:04.956
Yeah. Yeah,
it does bother me.

22:07.692 --> 22:13.162
She says "coinkidink"
instead of "coincidence."

22:13.230 --> 22:14.964
heI ner

22:15.032 --> 22:17.032
I hate that.
I love her. I hate that.

22:17.100 --> 22:19.634
Coinkidink.

22:19.702 --> 22:21.702
Do me a favor.
Don't say it.

22:21.770 --> 22:23.671
It really gets under my skin.

22:23.738 --> 22:26.508
Did you tell her
that it bothers you?

22:26.575 --> 22:29.511
Yeah. And she
called me Mr. Grumpy.

22:29.578 --> 22:32.379
I hate that almost
as much as coinkidink.

22:32.447 --> 22:35.214
She's got a way
of twisting words around

22:35.282 --> 22:39.183
and saying things
she thinks are clever.

22:39.251 --> 22:42.755
But they're just irritating.

22:42.823 --> 22:45.490
Tell me what
you love about her.

22:48.561 --> 22:51.428
I love that she doesn't care
what anyone thinks,

22:51.496 --> 22:53.331
even me,

22:53.399 --> 22:56.201
which is why she still
says things like coinkidink.

22:57.604 --> 23:01.473
I think maybe you're
focused on Betty

23:01.541 --> 23:03.408
when maybe there's
another problem

23:03.476 --> 23:07.478
that's a bigger problem
that you just can't deal with.

23:09.014 --> 23:12.483
Oh. Like my son
getting a girl pregnant.

23:13.952 --> 23:16.087
I'm dealing with it.

23:17.723 --> 23:19.657
You know what he said
this morning to me-- Ben?

23:21.427 --> 23:23.628
He's gonna go through
with the engagement

23:23.695 --> 23:25.563
that he threatened me with.

23:25.631 --> 23:27.665
He's actually gonna
get engaged to Adrian.

23:27.732 --> 23:29.900
Can you believe that?

23:29.968 --> 23:32.003
I told him, "You get engaged,
you're getting married,"

23:32.071 --> 23:34.238
'cause that's how
I feel about it.

23:34.306 --> 23:37.741
You give a ring,
you make a commitment.

23:37.809 --> 23:41.278
I wish they were more
than friends, but they're not.

23:41.346 --> 23:43.347
I mean, they're having
a baby together,

23:43.415 --> 23:45.616
so it would be nice
if they were more than friends.

23:45.684 --> 23:47.585
But then again, they're not.

23:47.652 --> 23:49.586
And you know why
they're not?

23:49.654 --> 23:52.555
'Cause he can't get over
his first love.

23:52.623 --> 23:54.056
He can't get over Amy.

23:55.491 --> 23:57.292
That's interesting.

23:57.360 --> 24:00.561
Interesting, huh?
What's so interesting about it?

24:01.964 --> 24:04.733
I think this is what
you told my last night,

24:04.801 --> 24:07.736
but correct me
if I'm wrong.

24:07.804 --> 24:10.905
You and Betty started out
as friends,

24:10.973 --> 24:12.874
then you and Betty had sex,

24:12.942 --> 24:15.710
and even though you didn't get
her pregnant or anything like that,

24:15.778 --> 24:17.946
you felt
you had to marry her.

24:18.014 --> 24:19.981
And now you feel,
even married,

24:20.049 --> 24:22.850
you're nothing more
than friends,

24:22.918 --> 24:26.287
because you're still in love
with your first wife,

24:26.355 --> 24:28.155
your first love,

24:28.223 --> 24:30.757
Ben's mom.

24:31.893 --> 24:33.828
Jeez.

24:33.896 --> 24:35.963
That's good.

24:36.031 --> 24:38.099
You're good.

24:38.167 --> 24:41.102
I'm angry with Ben
when I'm doing the same things.

24:41.169 --> 24:43.103
I mean, he's having a baby,
but basically,

24:43.171 --> 24:46.974
we're both behaving the same way
and have the same issues.

24:48.677 --> 24:50.645
That's really something.

24:50.712 --> 24:52.646
Yeah.

24:52.714 --> 24:54.715
I wonder what Betty
would call that.

24:54.783 --> 24:56.783
A coinkidink.

24:59.987 --> 25:01.921
Thank God I found you.
Can I come in?

25:01.989 --> 25:05.157
Yes, come in.
What took you so long?

25:05.225 --> 25:08.026
It's a big hospital.
I got a little lost in the parking lot.

25:08.094 --> 25:10.027
But what's going on?
Are you okay? Is the baby okay?

25:10.095 --> 25:12.729
I don't know.
I had some spotting.

25:12.797 --> 25:14.464
The nurse said
it's really pretty common

25:14.532 --> 25:17.734
and I'm probably going to be fine
and so will the baby.

25:17.802 --> 25:20.370
She said they'll probably just do 
another ultrasound, then I can go home.

25:20.437 --> 25:22.204
Who? Who's doing
the ultrasound?

25:22.272 --> 25:24.306
The doctor, I guess.

25:24.374 --> 25:25.507
Dr. Attavi?

25:25.575 --> 25:27.308
No. Some other doctor.

25:27.376 --> 25:30.379
Dr. Attavi's delivering a baby.
He's sending some other guy.

25:30.447 --> 25:32.784
Have you given any more thought
to maybe seeing his mother

25:32.851 --> 25:34.353
who's also a doctor
and a woman?

25:34.421 --> 25:35.826
No, I haven't.

25:35.893 --> 25:38.367
Maybe she could've
prevented this.

25:38.435 --> 25:41.773
I mean, maybe she knows more
because she's also a doctor and a woman.

25:41.841 --> 25:43.708
And a mother.
I forgot that. She's also a mother.

25:43.776 --> 25:45.210
Oh, jeez.
Thanks for coming.

25:45.278 --> 25:47.212
I would've come with you
if you had called me.

25:47.280 --> 25:50.048
I text you.
Yeah, when you're already at the hospital.

25:50.116 --> 25:52.517
Why didn't you call me?
I don't know.

25:52.585 --> 25:55.053
Look, I'm used to
handling things on my own.

25:55.120 --> 25:58.523
My mom's out of town,
my dad's at work, and I was on my own.

25:58.591 --> 26:00.525
You don't have to
be on your own.

26:00.593 --> 26:02.527
I'm willing to be
a part of this.

26:02.595 --> 26:05.630
Willing, huh?

26:05.698 --> 26:08.867
Look, you know what? You just wanna
be in control, and you're not in conrol.

26:08.934 --> 26:11.636
To you, this has just turned into some
elaborate scheme to get Amy back,

26:11.704 --> 26:13.238
when I really care
about this baby.

26:13.306 --> 26:16.474
Hey, I do, too.
I care about this baby, too.

26:16.542 --> 26:18.476
And you're just as guilty
as I am of scheming

26:18.544 --> 26:20.612
to try to get the person
you love back into your life.

26:22.448 --> 26:25.283
Hi. I'm Dr. Miller.
You must be Ben and Adrian.

26:26.685 --> 26:28.586
I, uh, went over
your personal history

26:28.654 --> 26:30.589
with Dr. Attavi,
so I'm very familiar

26:30.657 --> 26:32.224
with the two of you.

26:32.292 --> 26:33.759
I mean,
the three of you.

26:38.666 --> 26:40.534
Dr. Attavi
warned me about Ben.

26:40.601 --> 26:41.935
How are you, Ben?

26:42.003 --> 26:44.771
Never mind how I'm doing.
How's she doing?

26:44.839 --> 26:46.773
How's Adrian doing?
How's the baby doing?

26:46.841 --> 26:48.108
Could we just
find that out, huh?

26:48.176 --> 26:49.776
Everyone's gonna be fine.

26:49.844 --> 26:52.512
I am sure everyone's
gonna be just fine.

26:53.948 --> 26:55.215
Hi, Adrian.

26:55.282 --> 26:57.217
So I'm sure
the nurse already told you

26:57.284 --> 26:58.852
we're gonna do
another ultrasound,

26:58.919 --> 27:01.588
some blood work,
and we'll probably send you home.

27:06.227 --> 27:07.994
You can wait outside.

27:08.062 --> 27:11.165
Outside. Right. Outside.

27:11.233 --> 27:13.501
My place in all of this
is always gonna be outside.

27:13.569 --> 27:16.805
That's right. Until and unless
Adrian wants you somewhere else.

27:16.873 --> 27:19.108
I'll leave that up to you,
Doctor.

27:19.175 --> 27:21.310
Outside.

27:21.378 --> 27:22.511
Fine.

27:22.579 --> 27:25.281
I want you
to have this first.

27:29.186 --> 27:31.054
This is so romantic.

27:31.122 --> 27:34.325
Not like the night the baby was conceived,
so I hear.

27:35.427 --> 27:37.162
Is that real?

27:37.229 --> 27:38.663
Sure it is.

27:38.731 --> 27:40.999
Just like
his love for you.

27:41.067 --> 27:43.502
Sorry, but that's not gonna
fix this relationship,

27:43.569 --> 27:45.170
from what I've been told.

28:03.905 --> 28:05.172
Climb in.

28:05.239 --> 28:07.073
If I climb in,
I'll have to climb out.

28:07.141 --> 28:08.241
What's going on?

28:08.308 --> 28:10.176
I'm forbidden
from seeing Jack.

28:10.243 --> 28:13.411
Forbidden. And my phone and my computer
have been confiscated.

28:13.479 --> 28:15.546
You sent me a text message.

28:15.614 --> 28:17.583
And then my phone
got confiscated.

28:17.650 --> 28:19.951
This is all because
of that stupid sleepover?

28:20.019 --> 28:22.120
No, it's because Jack
told my dad

28:22.188 --> 28:25.156
that we're, you know,

28:25.224 --> 28:26.890
having--

28:26.958 --> 28:28.925
doing what we're doing.

28:28.993 --> 28:31.127
I'm sorry.
He did what?

28:31.195 --> 28:33.596
Yeah, Jack told my dad.
Can you believe it?

28:33.664 --> 28:35.932
No, I can't believe it.

28:35.999 --> 28:37.933
Did your dad tell my dad?

28:38.001 --> 28:40.268
'Cause for some reason,
my mom and my dad

28:40.336 --> 28:42.771
wanna see me,
together, to talk.

28:42.839 --> 28:45.607
Uh, I-- I don't think
my dad told your dad.

28:45.675 --> 28:48.743
But your dad did tell my dad
about the sleepover.

28:48.811 --> 28:50.945
But I don't think they're, like,
best friends now or anything.

28:51.013 --> 28:53.114
Even if they were best friends,

28:53.182 --> 28:55.250
I don't think that your father
would tell my father

28:55.317 --> 28:58.586
that you and Jack
are doing...what you're doing.

28:58.654 --> 29:00.121
Why would Jack do that?

29:00.189 --> 29:02.390
I don't know.
And we can't talk.

29:02.458 --> 29:05.326
You know, we can't e-mail,
we can't text or phone
or anything.

29:05.394 --> 29:07.028
Well, your parents
can't stop you

29:07.096 --> 29:08.930
from talking to Jack
once the summer is over.

29:08.998 --> 29:10.998
Once the summer's over,
you're back in school,

29:11.066 --> 29:14.068
and you'll see him every day
whether or not your dad wants you to.

29:14.135 --> 29:16.103
Is that right?

29:16.171 --> 29:18.806
Oh, man! Were you hiding in the bushes,
spying on me?

29:18.873 --> 29:20.741
Lauren's car
is in the driveway.

29:20.809 --> 29:22.743
I'm trying to get my car
out of the garage

29:22.811 --> 29:25.345
so I can get to my office
before the end of the workday.

29:25.413 --> 29:27.281
I thought he was gone already.

29:27.349 --> 29:28.950
I'm not good at sneaking around.

29:29.017 --> 29:30.551
Neither of you are.

29:30.619 --> 29:32.486
That's why the two of you
are going to summer school

29:32.554 --> 29:33.955
and working in
the food court this summer.

29:34.022 --> 29:35.623
Not the food court.

29:35.691 --> 29:37.625
I talked to your dad.
He talked to your mom.

29:37.693 --> 29:39.360
Summer school and food court,
and that's it.

29:39.428 --> 29:42.330
No boyfriends, no dating until September,
and then we'll see.

29:42.398 --> 29:44.665
So, you wanna move your car?

29:52.274 --> 29:55.008
Food court.

29:55.076 --> 29:56.777
[beeping]

29:58.146 --> 30:00.915
"Amy, I am here
at the hospital with Adrian.

30:00.982 --> 30:04.485
She's having
some minor problems,
but she and the baby are okay,"

30:04.552 --> 30:06.420
et cetera, et cetera.

30:06.487 --> 30:08.822
What? I'm sure she's
texted Ricky already.

30:08.889 --> 30:10.857
Oh, Ben, Ben, Ben.

30:10.925 --> 30:13.259
I'm gonna tell you
the same thing I told Adrian,

30:13.326 --> 30:15.627
only I have another patient
to go see,

30:15.695 --> 30:18.730
so I don't have time for
a long conversation with you.

30:18.797 --> 30:20.497
Grow up.

30:20.565 --> 30:23.103
You have no other choice.

30:23.171 --> 30:25.739
Grow up?
Why don't you grow up?

30:25.807 --> 30:27.741
What, are you 30?

30:29.143 --> 30:31.044
He's a sweet kid.

30:33.848 --> 30:35.282
Knock, knock.

30:35.350 --> 30:37.250
Come in.

30:37.318 --> 30:39.853
We can go now.

30:39.920 --> 30:42.255
Why don't you just follow me home?
I think we should talk.

30:42.322 --> 30:44.857
What happened? Everything's okay, right,
with you and the baby?

30:44.925 --> 30:46.859
Yeah, everything's fine,

30:46.927 --> 30:50.195
but we should talk
about this.

30:52.098 --> 30:54.032
Look, it's a beautiful ring,

30:54.099 --> 30:57.067
but maybe not such
a beautiful gesture.

30:57.135 --> 31:00.003
You know, the two of us getting fake engaged
with the fake engagement ring.

31:00.071 --> 31:02.272
It's not a fake ring.

31:02.340 --> 31:03.773
It's a real ring.

31:03.841 --> 31:05.708
It's a real sapphire ring

31:05.776 --> 31:07.744
given to Betty
by a real count.

31:07.812 --> 31:09.445
What?

31:09.513 --> 31:12.049
Yeah, it was Betty's, and she gave it to me
to give to you.

31:12.116 --> 31:14.018
But it's not like
it's a real engagement.

31:14.085 --> 31:15.920
It's just the engagement
we agreed on.

31:15.988 --> 31:17.256
And it's a nice ring.

31:17.324 --> 31:19.959
Betty's. It was Betty's?

31:20.027 --> 31:24.597
Yes. She's so excited about the baby, 
she gave it to me to give to you.

31:24.665 --> 31:26.432
I don't want Betty's ring.

31:26.500 --> 31:28.634
Why? What's wrong
with the ring?

31:28.702 --> 31:31.804
I understand what might be wrong 
with the engagement, but what's wrong with the ring?

31:31.872 --> 31:33.605
What did Betty do
to get that ring?

31:33.673 --> 31:35.740
I don't know.
What'd you do to get that ring?

31:45.718 --> 31:47.452
Adrian!

31:47.520 --> 31:49.421
I didn't mean it!

32:18.984 --> 32:21.585
Oh, hey.
AYou're home early.

32:21.653 --> 32:23.621
Is everything okay?

32:23.688 --> 32:25.322
Yeah, yeah.
Everything's fine.

32:25.390 --> 32:27.291
You don't hate me,
do you?

32:27.359 --> 32:29.226
No, no. I don't hate you.

32:29.293 --> 32:31.962
I don't hate you at all.
I love you, Betty.

32:32.029 --> 32:33.997
I'm sorry I've been
so short-tempered lately.

32:34.065 --> 32:37.033
Well, that's okay.
I just--

32:37.101 --> 32:39.336
I know you've been under
a lot of pressure lately.

32:39.403 --> 32:41.337
I put myself under
a lot of pressure.

32:41.405 --> 32:44.040
But there's no pressure.

32:44.108 --> 32:46.810
Not for me, anyway.

32:46.877 --> 32:50.113
Tell you what, let's go out to dinner.
Someplace nice.

32:50.181 --> 32:52.548
We'll take a ride up the coast to that place
you like at the beach.

32:52.616 --> 32:53.883
We'll have a bottle
of champagne.

32:53.951 --> 32:56.819
Do you wanna take Ben
and Adrian with us?

32:58.021 --> 32:59.956
Uh, I don't think so.

33:00.023 --> 33:01.991
Do you wanna take Ben
and Adrian with us?

33:02.059 --> 33:04.060
Can you keep a secret?

33:04.128 --> 33:05.828
I think I can, yeah.

33:05.896 --> 33:08.831
Well, this morning,

33:08.898 --> 33:12.000
he told me that he wanted
to give her an engagement ring.

33:12.068 --> 33:14.403
And, well, guess what?

33:14.470 --> 33:17.539
I just happened to have a ring that would
be great for just that

33:17.607 --> 33:20.108
hidden right here
in a fake book.

33:20.176 --> 33:23.345
Isn't that a coinkidink?

33:23.413 --> 33:27.182
Yeah, that's quite
a coincidence.

33:28.284 --> 33:29.884
That's okay, right?

33:29.952 --> 33:32.387
That I gave him the ring
to give her?

33:32.455 --> 33:35.490
Everything you do
is okay, Betty.

33:35.558 --> 33:38.860
We'll, uh-- We'll just let them
celebrate on their own.

33:38.927 --> 33:40.695
Okay.

33:40.763 --> 33:42.697
Well, then, we'll just go.

33:42.765 --> 33:44.766
Just the two of us.

33:44.833 --> 33:47.202
All right?
I'll be right back.

34:10.844 --> 34:14.079
Uh, I-- I just need
to ask you something.

34:18.117 --> 34:20.150
Hi.
We're closed.
Sorry.

34:20.185 --> 34:23.587
Is Ben here?
Ben Boykewich?

34:23.621 --> 34:24.621
No.

34:24.656 --> 34:26.790
Do you know
where he is?

34:26.824 --> 34:29.458
No, not really.
Why, are you a friend of his?

34:29.493 --> 34:31.159
I was at a party
at his house,

34:31.194 --> 34:34.596
but we didn't really get
a chance to talk that much.

34:34.630 --> 34:37.665
I just wanted to talk.
Just wanted to talk.

34:37.699 --> 34:39.934
Okay, I know who you are.

34:39.967 --> 34:41.536
You're Ricky.

34:41.570 --> 34:43.771
I heard people talking
about you at the party

34:43.806 --> 34:46.273
and after the party.

34:46.308 --> 34:48.576
And...

34:48.610 --> 34:50.444
I don't know.

34:50.478 --> 34:53.080
I thought I'd stop by
at closing time.

34:53.114 --> 34:55.416
It's summertime,
I'm bored,

34:55.449 --> 34:58.920
and I don't have
anything else to do.

34:58.954 --> 35:00.855
And I know that the girl

35:00.889 --> 35:02.790
that you had a baby with
is in New York,

35:02.824 --> 35:05.326
so I thought maybe
we could have a little fun.

35:05.360 --> 35:08.162
You wanna have a little fun?

35:08.197 --> 35:10.264
I'm not interested.

35:10.299 --> 35:14.168
No? I heard you're
always interested.

35:14.202 --> 35:16.604
In fact, I heard that

35:16.638 --> 35:19.006
you kissed
your girlfriend's sister,

35:19.041 --> 35:21.675
so...

35:21.710 --> 35:25.112
what would be wrong
with kissing me?

35:43.397 --> 35:47.067
Shop's closed.
And I'm going out of business.

35:47.101 --> 35:49.035
No, I don't do this anymore.

35:49.070 --> 35:51.938
No? Not one more time?

35:51.973 --> 35:56.343
Just one more time before the girlfriend
comes back home?

36:02.249 --> 36:03.316
Good night.

36:03.351 --> 36:04.784
Good night.

36:08.256 --> 36:10.324
Thank you for taking me
out to dinner.

36:10.358 --> 36:11.491
Anytime.

36:13.628 --> 36:15.063
Sorry I can't stay.

36:15.097 --> 36:16.731
My parents wanna spend
some time with me

36:16.766 --> 36:18.166
since we're going
to camp next week.

36:18.201 --> 36:20.402
It's okay.
I totally understand.

36:22.038 --> 36:24.006
Oh, sorry.
Did not see you there.

36:24.041 --> 36:26.710
Tom, yes, you did.
Hi, Tom.

36:26.744 --> 36:28.880
Bye, Grant. Good night.
Tom!

36:28.914 --> 36:32.317
That's okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.

36:33.286 --> 36:35.854
Oh, please.

36:35.888 --> 36:37.222
Bye.
Bye.

36:41.795 --> 36:43.630
Tom, I really like Grant.

36:43.664 --> 36:45.532
I can see that.

36:46.901 --> 36:49.135
Oh, hey, Tom.
There you are.

36:49.170 --> 36:51.271
Oh, that's what
this is about.

36:51.306 --> 36:53.407
Busted.

36:56.644 --> 36:58.010
You paid him for that?

36:58.045 --> 36:59.878
I pay him for everything.

36:59.912 --> 37:01.945
He doesn't have a job.
Neither do you.

37:01.979 --> 37:04.545
Yeah, but I don't pay rent.
And your mom told my parents

37:04.580 --> 37:07.045
that I don't need to do anything
other than what I can do for Tom.

37:07.079 --> 37:09.044
Oh, yeah. And you've only
helped him lose out

37:09.078 --> 37:11.441
on the only job he's
been able to get for years.

37:11.476 --> 37:13.173
Good night.
Wait.

37:13.208 --> 37:15.975
I wanted to talk to you.
All right.

37:16.009 --> 37:18.343
Madison's dad isn't gonna
let us go out all summer.

37:18.378 --> 37:21.646
Jack, just because
Madison's dad isn't gonna let

37:21.681 --> 37:24.114
you and Madison go out does not
 mean you and I are gonna go out.

37:24.149 --> 37:26.884
I wasn't gonna say that.
I don't wanna go out with you.

37:26.918 --> 37:29.053
Good. I don't wanna
go out with you.

37:29.087 --> 37:31.088
I was gonna say
that maybe we should get

37:31.123 --> 37:33.090
the teen abstinence group
going again.

37:33.124 --> 37:36.493
Maybe if we made a commitment
to abstinence again that it'd
be better for everyone.

37:36.527 --> 37:39.495
Hmm, especially for you,

37:39.530 --> 37:41.698
'cause you can't stand the thought
of my being with someone else

37:41.732 --> 37:44.601
even though you have
somebody else.

37:44.635 --> 37:46.936
Good night.

37:49.606 --> 37:51.773
Rats.

37:55.377 --> 37:57.277
Come in, Ben.

37:58.913 --> 38:00.580
Sorry to just show up,

38:00.614 --> 38:03.784
but Adrian's not taking my calls, and I wanted
to see how she's doing.

38:03.818 --> 38:05.218
She's all right.

38:05.253 --> 38:07.687
She had a little scare.
She'll be fine.

38:07.721 --> 38:10.356
Do you just hate me?

38:10.390 --> 38:11.991
You have to hate me.

38:12.025 --> 38:14.226
I don't hate you, Ben.

38:14.260 --> 38:17.529
I'm aware that...

38:17.563 --> 38:20.031
I'm aware of your situation
with Adrian,

38:20.065 --> 38:22.833
but I probably wasn't aware
of how difficult it was until now.

38:22.867 --> 38:25.368
Oh, and it's gonna get
a lot more difficult, believe me.

38:25.403 --> 38:28.071
Yeah, I know. That's--
That's kind of why I'm here.

38:28.106 --> 38:30.240
So, how are
your parents doing?

38:30.274 --> 38:32.575
My dad's having a hard time,

38:32.610 --> 38:36.613
but mainly because
I've been behaving idiotically.

38:36.647 --> 38:40.517
But Betty's just
perfectly accepting,

38:40.551 --> 38:42.152
and she's got no judgment,

38:42.186 --> 38:44.321
and she's excited
about the baby.

38:44.355 --> 38:46.356
That's where we've all
got to get to--

38:46.390 --> 38:48.525
to where Betty is.

38:48.559 --> 38:50.660
Hi, Ben.

38:52.196 --> 38:54.831
I didn't take your calls because I really don't
want to see you.

38:54.865 --> 38:58.034
But now that he's here,
I'm sure you will.

39:00.304 --> 39:02.205
I'm gonna
let you two talk.

39:02.239 --> 39:03.339
Night, Ben.

39:08.245 --> 39:10.980
I, uh--
I got your jacket.

39:12.716 --> 39:14.216
Thanks.

39:14.251 --> 39:15.885
I brought you
these flowers.

39:15.919 --> 39:17.720
Um, can I put them
in a vase for you?

39:17.754 --> 39:20.389
I'll do it later,
after you leave.

39:20.424 --> 39:22.491
When's that gonna be?

39:23.593 --> 39:25.528
You're not making this easy,
you know.

39:25.562 --> 39:27.397
What am I not making easy?

39:27.431 --> 39:29.765
Apologizing.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.901
I came here to apologize.

39:31.935 --> 39:33.102
Oh?

39:33.136 --> 39:36.472
I am so sorry

39:36.506 --> 39:39.542
that I haven't been able
to let go of my feelings for Amy

39:39.576 --> 39:42.745
and make you and the baby
a priority in my life.

39:42.779 --> 39:45.247
We're having a baby,
Adrian.

39:47.684 --> 39:49.852
We're really having a baby,

39:51.288 --> 39:54.089
and that became very real
to me today...

39:55.325 --> 39:57.426
as did my lack of maturity

39:57.460 --> 39:59.862
and responsibility.

40:01.431 --> 40:04.833
So I was wondering,

40:04.867 --> 40:08.436
would you give me a chance
to get to know you better...

40:09.972 --> 40:13.707
and be involved
in the pregnancy?

40:13.742 --> 40:18.711
I mean, no intimate medical procedures,
of course.

40:18.746 --> 40:22.581
But, I mean, outside of that,
would you let me be a part of this?

40:24.617 --> 40:27.418
Would you let me go to the bookstore with you
and get some books?

40:29.487 --> 40:31.721
Would you let me go to
the birthing classes with you?

40:34.325 --> 40:37.259
Will you let me be there
when the baby's born?

40:38.461 --> 40:40.428
You really wanna
do all that?

40:40.463 --> 40:42.263
Yeah, I wanna do that.
I do.

40:43.698 --> 40:45.599
I wanna do the right thing.

40:47.668 --> 40:50.136
I don't know what
the right thing is necessarily,

40:50.170 --> 40:52.338
but...

40:52.372 --> 40:54.640
I know it was the wrong thing
to try to fake an engagement

40:54.674 --> 40:56.675
and try to get back with Amy
when you and I

40:56.709 --> 40:59.947
are in this...situation
together.

41:01.217 --> 41:03.119
Okay.

41:04.288 --> 41:07.460
Then I guess I owe you
an apology, too.

41:09.066 --> 41:11.038
It's really hard to change.

41:11.072 --> 41:13.942
Even at 17, it's--
it's hard to change.

41:13.976 --> 41:18.013
But...I guess
like the doctor said,

41:18.047 --> 41:19.948
I have to.

41:19.982 --> 41:22.784
I have no other choice.
I'm--

41:22.818 --> 41:25.153
I'm gonna be a mother.

41:25.187 --> 41:27.956
And I wanna be
a good mother.

41:27.990 --> 41:30.058
I hope I can be
a good mother.

41:30.092 --> 41:34.328
I think that'll be a lot easier
if I can be a good father.

41:39.134 --> 41:41.202
Did you, um...

41:43.172 --> 41:45.239
Did you give Betty
her ring back?

41:45.274 --> 41:47.208
No. I still have it.
Do you want it?

41:47.242 --> 41:49.543
It doesn't have to be
an engagement ring.

41:49.578 --> 41:53.347
It could just be a--
like a place holder...

41:54.783 --> 41:58.085
in case someday
you wanna get engaged.

41:58.119 --> 42:00.321
And in case someday

42:00.355 --> 42:03.490
you want to give me
an engagement ring.

42:20.108 --> 42:22.643
Friends?

42:24.913 --> 42:26.179
Friends.

42:40.094 --> 42:42.529
Hi, John!

42:42.563 --> 42:46.099
Hey, buddy.
Mommy's home.

42:46.133 --> 42:47.600
Come here, buddy.

42:49.637 --> 42:51.605
Hey.

42:51.639 --> 42:53.640
What happened?
What are you doing here?

42:53.674 --> 42:55.508
Just a few more days.

42:55.543 --> 42:58.411
I thought it was more important
to see you before anything happens--

42:58.446 --> 43:00.981
anything that would
keep us apart.
