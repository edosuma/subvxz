01:40.200 --> 01:44.198
Come on, kids, out of the street.
Come on, kids, get back there.

01:47.582 --> 01:50.156
Hey, you. Get out of there!

02:09.270 --> 02:11.596
Get out of the street!

02:11.773 --> 02:14.525
Get out of the street!
Clear the street!

02:14.693 --> 02:16.851
Get away from there!

02:17.362 --> 02:19.770
Get out of the way, old man.
Can't you hear?

02:19.948 --> 02:22.617
Can't you see you're in the way?
Get out of here!

02:22.784 --> 02:25.453
- All right.
- Out of the way!

02:49.561 --> 02:51.850
Watch out, old-timer.

03:05.410 --> 03:08.909
You got a good horse, but not
good enough. I'll have that dollar.

03:09.080 --> 03:11.571
I'm beginning to figure
these races smell bad.

03:11.750 --> 03:13.873
That thing never loses.

03:14.044 --> 03:17.377
- You had your chance.
- Well, let's just say I'm a poor loser.

03:17.547 --> 03:19.041
So if you want this dollar...

03:19.216 --> 03:22.667
...you just come right on over here
and get it, sonny boy.

03:51.081 --> 03:53.488
Right this way, folks.
Come one, come all.

03:53.667 --> 03:57.083
Step right up and try your luck.
Everybody welcome.

03:57.254 --> 03:59.330
See the Oregon Kid in person.

03:59.506 --> 04:02.673
Right this way, folks.
Come one, come all.

04:02.842 --> 04:05.512
Step right up and outshoot
the famous Oregon Kid.

04:05.679 --> 04:07.920
The last of the Western town-tamers.

04:08.098 --> 04:12.724
Fatten your wallets and be a hero
to your family. Everybody welcome.

04:12.894 --> 04:17.437
Step up. Try your luck. All you gotta do
is hit the plates, and you win the money.

04:17.607 --> 04:21.937
- Quit the sermon and turn her loose.
- One dollar on the yellow.

04:33.748 --> 04:37.331
Shooting against you is like
sneaking licorice from a baby girl.

04:38.003 --> 04:40.244
Care to try again?

04:54.269 --> 04:57.472
Mister, could I make a 10-cent bet?

04:57.647 --> 05:00.981
A whole dime? You're a plunger, sir.

05:01.151 --> 05:05.979
Well, I ain't so altogether sure I could
hit a moving target without buckshot.

05:06.156 --> 05:08.362
I used to be fair with a scattergun...

05:08.533 --> 05:12.531
...but then that was when the bird
wasn't too far away or flying too fast.

05:12.704 --> 05:16.073
Them plates, I just don't see
how you manage.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.623
Well, I'll be damned.

05:19.794 --> 05:21.953
- How are you, Gil?
- No great complaints.

05:22.130 --> 05:24.538
How long has it been?
Lordy, I'd hate to say.

05:24.716 --> 05:26.127
Quite some time.

05:26.301 --> 05:28.128
Where you been all these years?

05:28.303 --> 05:32.348
Here and there.
Quite a little enterprise you've got.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.969
Well, Steve, it's easier
than punching cows...

05:37.145 --> 05:40.479
...and it pays off with free drinks
when I walk into a saloon.

05:40.649 --> 05:43.650
Would it surprise you
that the Oregon Kid is the envy...

05:43.818 --> 05:48.315
...of every small-minded ribbon clerk and
shirttail towhead from here to Pocatello?

05:48.490 --> 05:51.574
Well, why not?
All these single-handed exploits.

05:51.743 --> 05:57.034
Tell me, Gil, who was the Omaha gang?
I don't seem to recollect them fellers.

05:57.207 --> 06:01.370
Flagstaff, Monterey, Hondo,
I remember we worked them places.

06:01.545 --> 06:05.756
Dodge City and Wichita.
Did you ever run with the Earp boys, Gil?

06:05.924 --> 06:09.507
You gotta allow for exaggeration.
That's part of playing the game.

06:09.678 --> 06:13.378
That's not much of a game. A blind man
couldn't miss using buckshot.

06:13.557 --> 06:16.392
It must be something important
to bring you here.

06:16.560 --> 06:19.893
Looks like you've been riding
a long time but not getting far.

06:20.063 --> 06:21.063
Job.

06:21.648 --> 06:24.317
You mean you're still at it?
Federal marshal?

06:24.484 --> 06:27.058
No, working for the bank.

06:27.237 --> 06:29.230
You, a bank guard?

06:29.406 --> 06:34.068
I'm transporting gold from the mining
camp up there to the bank down here.

06:34.244 --> 06:38.372
Gold bullion, $250,000 worth,
the way the letter put it.

06:38.957 --> 06:40.202
A quarter of a million.

06:40.375 --> 06:43.910
And I could use some help.
Can you recommend anyone?

06:45.839 --> 06:48.591
- I'll give it some thought.
- You do that, will you?

06:48.758 --> 06:53.088
- And let me know.
- I will, Steve. I surely will.

07:07.736 --> 07:09.563
What do you figure we're gonna do?

07:10.989 --> 07:13.314
Drink champagne, kid,
and only the best.

07:13.491 --> 07:17.489
About $250,000 worth.

07:40.227 --> 07:44.307
- I'd like to see Mr. Samson, please.
- He's busy.

07:45.398 --> 07:49.266
Would you tell him it's Mr. Judd.
Stephen Judd.

07:54.199 --> 07:56.238
Just one minute.

07:58.662 --> 08:00.619
Excuse me, sir.

08:01.164 --> 08:02.964
Mr. Judd.

08:06.795 --> 08:08.834
Have him come in, Abner.

08:11.883 --> 08:13.959
Mr. Samson will see you.

08:14.135 --> 08:15.630
Thank you.

08:22.477 --> 08:23.806
How do you do, Mr. Judd?

08:23.979 --> 08:26.470
I'm Luther Samson,
and this is my son, Abner.

08:26.648 --> 08:30.646
- He's the vice president.
- I'm pleased to meet you, Mr. Judd.

08:34.780 --> 08:40.736
Well, I must say, Mr. Judd,
I expected a much younger man.

08:40.912 --> 08:45.823
- Well, I used to be. We all used to be.
- Yes. Yes, of course.

08:46.001 --> 08:49.037
Mr. Judd, we're more than familiar
with your reputation.

08:49.212 --> 08:53.708
But that was made many years ago, and
we're dealing in the present, not the past.

08:54.801 --> 08:56.260
What's the problem?

08:56.428 --> 08:58.966
The Coarsegold strike
is on the crest of the Sierras.

08:59.139 --> 09:01.511
There's only one trail. One in, one out.

09:01.683 --> 09:05.182
Six miners have been killed
trying to get their gold to us.

09:05.353 --> 09:08.271
Six miners killed and robbed, Mr. Judd.

09:08.440 --> 09:12.023
Several weeks ago we petitioned
for a marshal, but nothing happened.

09:12.194 --> 09:15.527
The only law there is too drunk
to hit the ground with his hat.

09:15.697 --> 09:19.861
The man we send must be completely
reliable, to say nothing of being honest.

09:20.035 --> 09:23.902
We're speaking of gold, Mr. Judd.
Twenty thousand dollars worth.

09:24.080 --> 09:25.740
Twenty thousand?

09:26.082 --> 09:28.324
Why, I thought your letter said 250,000.

09:28.501 --> 09:31.870
Our original estimate
was overly enthusiastic.

09:32.047 --> 09:35.629
The strike isn't a mother lode,
but it's productive. Slow and steady.

09:35.800 --> 09:39.798
- And we intend to get our share.
- The days of the forty-niners are past...

09:39.971 --> 09:43.554
...and the days of the steady
businessmen have arrived.

09:45.727 --> 09:49.807
My usual fee is $20 a day.
I'll have to charge you 40.

09:49.981 --> 09:51.808
- Forty dollars a day?
- For what?

09:51.983 --> 09:55.898
For two extra men. I don't intend
to go four days without sleeping.

09:56.071 --> 09:58.229
- The question is...
- Can I do it?

09:58.406 --> 10:01.076
I can't answer that by talking,
only by doing it.

10:01.243 --> 10:05.323
If you two wanna talk about it,
you go ahead, and I'll read the contract.

10:05.497 --> 10:09.115
Well, I guess that'll be all right.

10:10.252 --> 10:13.917
- In private, if you please.
- Well...

10:14.089 --> 10:15.998
...you can go in there.

11:07.225 --> 11:10.725
Well, the contract's all right.
How about me? Any doubts?

11:11.104 --> 11:13.227
If not, I'll sign it.

11:13.523 --> 11:17.224
Well, I guess it's all right.

11:39.507 --> 11:44.419
That old man is Steve Judd?
He don't look like much to me.

11:45.222 --> 11:48.222
Son, I wore a star for six years
with that old man.

11:48.391 --> 11:52.223
I was his deputy most of the time.
Once he was mine.

11:52.395 --> 11:54.684
Don't ever play him short.

11:54.856 --> 11:57.857
I just don't figure him
to be any trouble, that's all.

11:58.026 --> 12:02.190
I hope you're right, boy.
I surely hope you're right.

12:02.364 --> 12:07.073
I'll be at the lion. You demonstrate how
impressed you are, with your mouth shut.

12:08.286 --> 12:10.113
- Hi, Mr. Westrum.
- Evening, honey.

12:10.288 --> 12:11.866
Hello, Heck.

12:12.290 --> 12:14.532
- Stop that!
- What did I do?

12:14.709 --> 12:17.544
Never mind what you did.
Don't do it in here.

12:17.712 --> 12:20.382
- Can I pick you up in an hour?
- I think so.

12:20.549 --> 12:23.218
Too bad, because Heck won't be there.

12:23.385 --> 12:27.217
- Why not?
- Because if I can't, you won't.

12:28.598 --> 12:32.810
- Still keeping records, eh?
- You know me. Creature of habit.

12:32.978 --> 12:36.394
Somebody else wants to know you.
My partner, Heck Longtree.

12:36.565 --> 12:38.972
You'd blush to hear the way
he admires you.

12:39.150 --> 12:41.227
- How do you do?
- Howdy.

12:41.403 --> 12:43.146
Have a chair.

12:45.949 --> 12:48.072
Showing your age, aren't you?

12:48.243 --> 12:51.113
Interfering in a young man's love life.

12:51.288 --> 12:54.491
He's got more important things
on his mind. Haven't you?

12:54.666 --> 12:57.371
Haven't you? Yes, sir, and so have I.

12:57.544 --> 13:01.873
Been considering your problem. Think
I can solve half, perhaps the whole thing.

13:02.048 --> 13:04.966
I know a fellow who's got
an overwhelming hankering...

13:05.135 --> 13:07.424
...for a little old-time activity.

13:07.596 --> 13:12.304
A man would have to be pretty hard up
to want to risk his life for $ 10 a day.

13:12.475 --> 13:14.349
Ten dollars a day?

13:14.519 --> 13:16.311
Not hard up. Just fed up.

13:16.479 --> 13:21.438
Outshooting rubes for nickels and dimes.
Takes free drinks to put me to sleep.

13:21.610 --> 13:24.065
My partner feels the same way.

13:24.279 --> 13:26.651
- Don't you?
- Yeah.

13:27.157 --> 13:30.656
- I don't think I'd wanna hire a boy.
- What do you mean, a boy?

13:30.827 --> 13:33.911
Steve, this boy's a good deal
less than green.

13:34.080 --> 13:37.366
- He can't have much behind him.
- That's where you're wrong.

13:37.542 --> 13:41.077
He's been dogging after me
for better than three years.

13:42.672 --> 13:44.072
Pretty.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.630
Too bad he can't keep it clean.

13:47.594 --> 13:51.093
Boys nowadays. No pride.
No self-respect.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.471
Plenty of gall, but no sand.

13:53.642 --> 13:57.141
- Now, you take that race today...
- What about that race?

13:57.312 --> 14:01.061
Well, at that distance, no horse
in the world could beat a camel.

14:06.279 --> 14:08.605
Are you calling me a cheat?

14:08.782 --> 14:11.154
Well, if he don't, I will.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.730
Go get them, tiger.
You're doing fine. Just fine.

15:10.927 --> 15:14.296
- What do you think, Steve?
- I think he's wonderful.

15:14.472 --> 15:17.888
He'll do. He'll do just fine.

15:39.539 --> 15:42.873
What's the matter, partner?
Your rheumatism bothering you?

15:43.043 --> 15:45.960
I'm used to working with my brain,
not my backside.

15:49.257 --> 15:52.424
- You think you can talk him into it?
- One way or another.

15:52.594 --> 15:55.761
I'd just as soon we'd split it
two ways instead of three.

15:55.931 --> 15:58.766
Kid, you've got an awful lot to learn.

17:23.101 --> 17:25.674
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

17:25.854 --> 17:27.265
Joshua Knudsen's the name.

17:27.439 --> 17:30.772
This is Gil Westrum and Heck Longtree.

17:30.942 --> 17:34.192
My name is Judd. Stephen Judd.

17:34.404 --> 17:37.405
- I've heard the name.
- We're on our way to Coarsegold.

17:37.574 --> 17:40.112
Could you furnish accommodations
for the night?

17:40.285 --> 17:45.077
I've got no room in the house, but I won't
object if you wanna stay in the barn.

17:45.373 --> 17:49.703
Thank you, sir. If you could spare us a
few eggs, we'd be glad to pay for them.

17:49.878 --> 17:53.710
Well, one you can have. Because
the Lord's bounty is not for sale.

17:53.882 --> 17:56.420
- The rest are a dollar each.
- A dollar each?

17:56.593 --> 17:59.380
How do those short-legged chickens
lay eggs so high?

17:59.554 --> 18:03.884
Levity in the young is like unto a dry
gourd with the seeds rattling around.

18:11.775 --> 18:14.266
My daughter, Elsa.

18:14.903 --> 18:16.896
- How do you do?
- Pleased to meet you.

18:17.072 --> 18:19.195
- Likewise.
- Go start supper.

18:19.366 --> 18:22.402
- And change that dress.
- Change it? What for?

18:22.577 --> 18:26.160
For the good reason I told you to.
Did you hear what I said?

18:28.667 --> 18:31.668
- I think it's a real pretty dress.
- Thank you.

18:39.344 --> 18:41.669
Put your horses in the corral yonder.

18:41.847 --> 18:45.298
Supper will be ready in an hour.
No charge. The Lord's bounty...

18:45.475 --> 18:48.262
- Is not for sale.
- Thank you, sir.

18:48.436 --> 18:51.058
Think of all that going to waste up here.

18:51.231 --> 18:54.101
Like the fellow said,
gold is where you find it.

18:54.276 --> 18:57.692
And if it's not yours, don't covet it.

18:58.446 --> 19:01.447
Don't worry.
The Lord's bounty may not be for sale...

19:01.616 --> 19:05.281
...but the devil's is,
if you can pay the price.

19:12.252 --> 19:15.372
There's a lot of truth
in those words, Heck.

19:15.547 --> 19:16.547
Yeah?

19:17.883 --> 19:20.753
- Yeah.
- Supper's ready.

19:36.443 --> 19:37.985
Gentlemen.

19:59.216 --> 20:02.798
Heavenly Father, we thank thee
for the food on this table.

20:03.595 --> 20:07.295
Teach thy children to be grateful
for thy goodness...

20:07.474 --> 20:09.929
...to walk in thy path...

20:10.310 --> 20:15.351
...that they may not suffer
thy wrath and thy vengeance.

20:15.524 --> 20:18.015
Bless us, O Lord,
and these our guests...

20:18.193 --> 20:22.107
...and forgive them the mercenary
desires which brought them here.

20:22.572 --> 20:23.572
Amen.

20:30.705 --> 20:35.367
Thanks for entering a plea on our behalf,
but what's this about mercenary desires?

20:35.544 --> 20:39.873
You're on your way to Coarsegold. Them
that travel there do so for one reason.

20:40.048 --> 20:41.957
To traffic in gold.

20:42.133 --> 20:47.720
Which to possess is to live in fear,
to desire, to live in sorrow.

20:47.889 --> 20:51.092
But we're not trafficking, sir.
Merely transporting.

20:51.268 --> 20:56.642
It says in the Book, Gold is a stumbling
block to them that sacrifice to it...

20:56.815 --> 20:59.140
...and every fool
shall be taken therewith.

20:59.317 --> 21:02.152
A good name is rather to be chosen
than great riches.

21:02.320 --> 21:05.405
A loving favor
rather than silver and gold.

21:05.574 --> 21:07.317
Proverbs, chapter 22.

21:07.492 --> 21:12.071
Into the land of trouble and anguish
come the old lions...

21:12.247 --> 21:16.161
...and they shall carry their riches
on the shoulders of young asses...

21:16.334 --> 21:18.956
...to a people that shall not profit them.

21:19.129 --> 21:22.794
Isaiah, chapter 30, verse six.

21:22.966 --> 21:25.753
That mining town
is a sinkhole of depravity.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.593
A place of shame and sin.

21:28.763 --> 21:32.263
According to Father, every place
outside this farm is a place of sin.

21:32.434 --> 21:35.269
- That'll do.
- You don't have to preach at everybody.

21:35.437 --> 21:36.931
That will do.

21:40.442 --> 21:43.977
You cook a lovely ham hock,
Miss Knudsen. Just lovely.

21:44.779 --> 21:47.105
Appetite, chapter one.

21:50.785 --> 21:53.276
Give me a towel, and I'll dry.

21:54.289 --> 21:57.041
Thanks just the same. You hadn't better.

22:14.476 --> 22:17.263
It must be pretty lonely living up here.

22:18.021 --> 22:22.979
Sometimes I think there's nobody
left in the world but my father and me.

22:38.625 --> 22:42.492
It's a crime. A girl like you
being stuck up on this old stump ranch.

22:42.671 --> 22:46.170
A girl like you ought to
be living in the city.

22:46.341 --> 22:48.464
San Francisco, say.

22:48.635 --> 22:52.170
- You've been there?
- Plenty of times.

22:54.224 --> 22:56.631
I never been anywhere.

22:57.018 --> 23:00.683
He won't even take me to town
when he goes after supplies.

23:00.856 --> 23:03.975
He says the men would stare at me.

23:09.406 --> 23:14.032
Suppose on the way back,
I was to pick you up...

23:14.494 --> 23:16.487
...and take you to San Francisco...

23:16.663 --> 23:18.038
...or Denver.

23:18.206 --> 23:21.373
- Chicago, even.
- Elsa, who you talking to in there?

23:21.543 --> 23:23.832
To myself. You'd better go.

23:24.004 --> 23:25.747
- I'll meet you outside.
- I can't.

23:25.922 --> 23:27.998
I'll wait for you by the corral.

23:48.904 --> 23:52.948
That boy you trained personally
shows a substantial lack of judgment.

23:53.116 --> 23:54.741
Showing your age, aren't you?

23:56.244 --> 23:59.079
Interfering with a young man's love life?

23:59.915 --> 24:03.580
Well, I'm not paying him $ 10 a day
to go mooning after some girl...

24:03.752 --> 24:07.500
...whose old man's about
to hind-end him with a load of buckshot.

24:09.466 --> 24:11.838
- Know who she reminds me of, Steve?
- No.

24:12.010 --> 24:14.252
Sara Truesdale.

24:15.222 --> 24:16.882
There's no resemblance at all.

24:17.057 --> 24:20.390
Oh, maybe not in the features,
but the way she smiles.

24:20.560 --> 24:23.561
There's the same look in her eyes
when you talk to her.

24:23.730 --> 24:27.810
The kind of look that makes you feel
you've said something real important.

24:28.276 --> 24:31.147
You and Sara always looked
so right together.

24:31.321 --> 24:33.942
I can't say I blamed her
for not marrying you.

24:35.742 --> 24:39.954
Forgetting the lousy money we made,
what woman wants to sit around...

24:40.121 --> 24:44.036
...waiting for her husband to be
brought home with his head shot off?

24:46.127 --> 24:49.793
I wonder if I can get these fixed
in Coarsegold.

24:49.965 --> 24:54.627
I guess losing Sara is what you
might call a hazard of our profession.

24:55.011 --> 24:58.594
That rancher she married...
Stacey, is it?

24:58.849 --> 25:01.968
He's doing fine up in Idaho.
Got a big ranch there.

25:02.143 --> 25:04.551
Raises blooded horses.

25:04.813 --> 25:08.811
- And children too, I hear.
- Grandchildren now.

25:09.734 --> 25:11.478
Three of them.

25:12.571 --> 25:14.528
That right, Steve?

25:15.365 --> 25:18.319
Yep, that's right.

25:18.910 --> 25:22.742
Three grandchildren.
Think she's happy, Steve?

25:27.711 --> 25:32.918
If my sleeping bothers you,
don't you bother to let me know.

25:33.425 --> 25:34.625
Sorry.

25:37.596 --> 25:39.196
Evening.

25:41.349 --> 25:44.386
- You surely took your time.
- I shouldn't be here at all.

25:44.561 --> 25:47.266
Well, why? Does the night air
bother you?

25:47.439 --> 25:49.846
If it does, come on up in the hay.

25:50.025 --> 25:52.267
I love the night air.

25:58.909 --> 26:02.028
The thing is, I'm what
you might call engaged.

26:02.204 --> 26:04.955
- Sure you are.
- It's the truth.

26:06.249 --> 26:08.372
His name is Billy Hammond.

26:08.543 --> 26:10.037
He asked me to marry him.

26:10.712 --> 26:12.372
Several times.

26:12.923 --> 26:15.710
I said I thought I probably would.

26:16.009 --> 26:20.137
You'll see him in Coarsegold. He's
a miner at the strike, doing real well.

26:21.056 --> 26:24.057
Well, if he's in Coarsegold...

26:26.061 --> 26:27.888
...and you're here...

26:28.063 --> 26:30.554
...I don't see any harm in talking.

26:31.650 --> 26:34.686
You! Get in the barn and stay there!

26:36.488 --> 26:40.402
And you, go to the house.

27:00.220 --> 27:03.387
The mouth of a strange woman
is a deep pit...

27:03.557 --> 27:07.471
...and him that is abhorred
of the Lord shall fall therein.

27:13.483 --> 27:17.944
- Won't you never learn any decency?
- We were only gonna talk. Talk.

27:18.113 --> 27:21.446
- The likes of him don't stop at talking.
- The likes of him.

27:21.616 --> 27:24.286
Every man I meet
becomes "the likes of him."

27:24.452 --> 27:27.537
- He's no good. I see it in his face.
- That's all you see.

27:27.706 --> 27:30.742
Billy Hammond came here twice.
You said he was evil.

27:30.917 --> 27:33.491
I'm your father.
I've got to keep the dirt away.

27:33.670 --> 27:36.837
- Protect you from the wrong kind of men.
- That's everyone.

27:37.007 --> 27:40.008
Every single man is the wrong kind
of man. Except you.

27:55.400 --> 27:59.943
I promised the next time you hit me,
you'd be sorry for it.

28:00.822 --> 28:03.989
For my mouth shall speak truth...

28:04.159 --> 28:07.658
...and wickedness
is an abomination to my lips.

28:08.872 --> 28:12.870
All the words of my mouth
are in righteousness.

28:14.461 --> 28:17.661
Elsa, I'm sorry.

28:26.681 --> 28:30.679
Receive my instruction and not silver...

28:30.852 --> 28:34.186
...and knowledge rather
than choice gold.

28:37.150 --> 28:40.187
For wisdom is better than rubies.

29:35.584 --> 29:38.253
In about 30 years,
you'll like the feel of it too.

29:42.591 --> 29:46.719
Pick that up. These mountains
don't need your trash.

30:03.278 --> 30:05.650
Dandy pair of boots you got here.

30:05.822 --> 30:10.449
Juan Fernandez made those boots
for me in San Antone. Special order.

30:10.619 --> 30:14.035
I had a hell of a time getting him
to put that hole in there.

30:14.206 --> 30:18.286
A fine craftsman, but he never did
understand the principle of ventilation.

30:18.460 --> 30:22.956
I remember Juan. Always felt
the boot should cover the foot.

30:23.131 --> 30:25.171
Short-sighted.

30:27.719 --> 30:32.180
Remember Doc Franklin, the fancy boots
he wore with the flaps over the toes?

30:32.349 --> 30:34.637
Had them made in Boston.

30:35.268 --> 30:38.969
- Old Doc. Know what happened to him?
- I heard he died.

30:39.147 --> 30:42.563
That's right. Old Doc.

30:42.734 --> 30:46.946
Gave 30 years of his life to make
the West safe for decent people.

30:47.113 --> 30:51.277
You'd have wept to see the way they
turned out to pay tribute. Three of them.

30:51.451 --> 30:54.452
The mortician,
the gravedigger and me.

30:54.913 --> 31:00.156
Well, when I'm buried, I won't
much care who comes to the funeral.

31:00.335 --> 31:04.664
I was commenting on the fairest flower
that grows within the human heart:

31:04.839 --> 31:06.168
Gratitude.

31:06.341 --> 31:09.959
The only gratitude I expect
is my paycheck. Twenty dollars' worth.

31:10.136 --> 31:14.466
- That satisfies you?
- Well, I guess that's all I can hope for.

31:14.641 --> 31:15.841
Is it?

31:16.142 --> 31:19.428
According to my contract, it is.
Come on, let's get moving.

31:24.776 --> 31:29.105
- He don't know what you're talking about.
- He will, in time.

31:29.281 --> 31:32.946
When we're ready, let's bend a gun
over his head and take the gold.

31:33.118 --> 31:36.950
You couldn't get close enough
to Steve Judd to saddle his horse.

31:37.122 --> 31:39.031
Well, you could.

31:39.833 --> 31:42.538
Yes, I could, but I won't.

31:44.212 --> 31:45.920
Unless I have to.

32:27.797 --> 32:31.498
I hope heaven forgives us
for earning this easy money.

32:31.676 --> 32:36.172
I seem to remember a man
hankering for some old-time activity.

32:36.348 --> 32:40.096
I'd like to see some old-time mountains.

32:40.769 --> 32:46.107
As I recall, they sure were
a lot easier to get around in.

32:46.274 --> 32:48.848
You sure complain a lot in your old age.

32:49.027 --> 32:53.274
Well, I got something to complain about.

32:53.949 --> 32:58.741
You're earning twice the money
for taking the same risk.

33:03.875 --> 33:08.584
Plus possessing all the other rewards
you've gathered...

33:08.755 --> 33:11.791
...during your years of loyal service.

33:11.967 --> 33:15.418
A bluegrass thoroughbred,
silver-mounted saddle...

33:15.595 --> 33:18.217
...magnificent wardrobe. I'm envious.

33:18.390 --> 33:21.556
What more could a man expect?
What more can a man hope for?

33:21.726 --> 33:24.930
You forgot to mention
my two-dollar watch.

33:34.489 --> 33:36.648
Waste of breath.

33:48.003 --> 33:50.375
What else could a man expect?

33:50.547 --> 33:53.168
I got to thinking about that one time.

33:53.341 --> 33:58.502
I keep records. When I became a lawman,
the world lost a first-class bookkeeper.

33:58.680 --> 34:03.342
So to pass the time one day, I calculated
what it was worth getting shot at.

34:03.518 --> 34:05.890
I figured it at about $ 100 a shot.

34:06.062 --> 34:08.054
You'd have earned quite a sum by now.

34:08.231 --> 34:12.014
Getting hit, I figure that's worth
anywhere from 1000 on up.

34:12.194 --> 34:15.812
- That's 3000 I know you got coming.
- Four brings it up to date.

34:15.989 --> 34:20.235
And when you tally up all those fights
and bushwhackings and cold camps...

34:20.409 --> 34:24.159
...that time in Lincoln County,
five weeks in the hospital...

34:24.331 --> 34:28.031
...six months out of work.
You add them all up, and I'd figure...

34:28.210 --> 34:32.041
...I was owed about all the gold
we could carry out of these mountains.

34:32.422 --> 34:34.628
That's something to dream about.

34:37.719 --> 34:39.628
It sure is.

34:46.728 --> 34:47.728
Heck!

34:56.987 --> 34:59.989
- Mind if I keep you company on the trip?
- I don't mind.

35:00.158 --> 35:01.569
- I do.
- I'll second that.

35:01.743 --> 35:05.657
My advice is turn the horse around
and ride back where you belong.

35:05.830 --> 35:10.492
I'm not going back to my father. I'm going
to Coarsegold to marry Billy Hammond.

35:10.669 --> 35:13.242
Why do you wanna do
a foolish thing like that?

35:13.421 --> 35:14.666
That's my affair.

35:14.839 --> 35:18.754
She's right, Heck. Our business
is transporting gold, not girls.

35:18.927 --> 35:23.055
Thanks for paying back our hospitality.
Those ham hocks and everything.

35:23.223 --> 35:25.714
I'm a strong believer
in love and gratitude...

35:25.892 --> 35:29.308
...but not strong enough to bring
you under these conditions.

35:29.479 --> 35:30.760
I'll ride by myself.

35:31.982 --> 35:34.307
We can make three miles
before it gets dark.

35:34.484 --> 35:36.192
Right. Got to cover ground.

35:36.361 --> 35:38.769
- Got a gun?
- No, I don't have a gun.

35:38.947 --> 35:41.901
Too bad. This is certain
mountain-lion country.

35:42.075 --> 35:43.190
It sure is.

35:43.368 --> 35:45.941
Well, build a good fire.
It will scare them off.

35:46.121 --> 35:47.401
You both go on ahead.

35:47.581 --> 35:51.329
I couldn't sleep tonight
with the thought of Elsa by herself.

35:51.501 --> 35:55.285
I'll stay with her and meet you
in Coarsegold. Go on ahead.

35:56.298 --> 35:59.548
Those mountain lions,
some don't scare so easy.

35:59.801 --> 36:01.628
Come along, girl.

36:18.195 --> 36:23.189
- Do you remember old man Teaford?
- Oh, yeah.

36:24.951 --> 36:27.786
All night, Logan.

36:27.954 --> 36:30.445
Way up, Logan.

36:41.468 --> 36:44.338
You know, the way you do your hair
looks real nice.

36:44.513 --> 36:46.470
You think so?

36:46.806 --> 36:49.297
Pa had me cut it short.

36:49.768 --> 36:53.812
It sort of fits the shape of your head,
when you see it from the side.

36:54.022 --> 36:56.015
Yeah. Like that.

36:56.191 --> 37:00.105
You know, most girls don't know
the first thing about their hair.

37:00.362 --> 37:03.695
I guess you're an authority
on what most girls do.

37:03.865 --> 37:06.403
Well, I've studied the subject.

37:06.618 --> 37:09.453
Not just what they do, but why.

37:10.038 --> 37:12.161
Now, you take this getting married.

37:12.332 --> 37:14.953
Do you think that's such a good idea?

37:15.710 --> 37:17.454
If I didn't, I wouldn't be here.

37:17.629 --> 37:21.958
My guess is, you're doing it to get away
from your pa. To get even, maybe.

37:22.551 --> 37:24.876
I guess your guess
is as good as anybody's.

37:25.053 --> 37:28.387
Well, if it's wrong,
how come you ran away?

37:30.392 --> 37:33.761
Because my father
doesn't want me to get married.

37:34.437 --> 37:36.679
Always says he does.

37:37.107 --> 37:40.024
If I can find a decent young man.

37:40.902 --> 37:44.105
But nobody's decent, according to him.

37:47.075 --> 37:49.233
You included.

37:50.412 --> 37:52.451
He said you were no good.

37:52.622 --> 37:55.789
He said the likes of you
don't stop at talking.

37:57.752 --> 38:00.243
You know, he has a point there.

38:03.300 --> 38:04.960
Don't move!

38:05.343 --> 38:06.968
Don't move, Elsa.

38:28.033 --> 38:32.695
No! Heck, no! Let me go! No! No!

38:35.707 --> 38:37.616
Let me go!

38:53.391 --> 38:55.591
My, oh, my.

39:05.111 --> 39:06.938
When I questioned you about him...

39:07.113 --> 39:10.114
...I should've gone more
into the subject of character.

39:10.283 --> 39:13.237
I hope that's a mistake
I won't live to regret.

39:13.411 --> 39:15.737
Good fight. I enjoyed it.

39:27.342 --> 39:29.335
That old man?

39:29.636 --> 39:32.174
That old man is about half rough.

39:32.347 --> 39:35.882
- You learned a lesson, didn't you?
- I surely did.

39:36.059 --> 39:37.684
Got room for another?

39:37.853 --> 39:39.892
Let her fly.

39:48.363 --> 39:51.814
We're not here for romance.
Understand me, son?

39:51.992 --> 39:53.652
Yes, sir.

40:15.056 --> 40:18.425
I hope Mr. Judd didn't hurt you too bad.

40:19.853 --> 40:24.182
- I guess it's kind of my fault.
- What do you mean, "kind of"?

40:24.357 --> 40:27.561
I acted silly. I'm sorry.

40:27.736 --> 40:29.396
I do like you, Heck.

40:30.071 --> 40:33.405
Save the sugar talk for your Billy boy.
I don't need it.

40:33.575 --> 40:38.118
What you need's the kind of girl who'd go
with you to San Francisco or Denver.

40:38.288 --> 40:39.782
And there's plenty of them.

40:39.956 --> 40:43.325
I changed my mind.
You got just what you deserve!

40:46.796 --> 40:48.789
You got something to say?

40:48.965 --> 40:52.963
No, I think she about covered everything.

41:07.484 --> 41:10.271
Lovely place. A beauty spot of nature.

41:10.445 --> 41:13.529
A Garden of Eden for the sore in heart
and short of cash.

41:13.698 --> 41:16.450
We didn't come here
to enjoy the scenery.

41:33.468 --> 41:35.876
The High Sierra Crochet
and Garden Society...

41:36.054 --> 41:38.343
...seem to be having
their weekly meeting.

41:39.307 --> 41:43.886
When we get located, pass the word that
we're in camp and ready for business.

41:45.021 --> 41:48.770
And you, find out where the Hammond
claim is and take her there.

41:48.942 --> 41:49.985
Why me?

41:50.151 --> 41:53.651
Because Steve and I
are gonna be busy collecting gold.

42:00.245 --> 42:02.238
Not too late to change your mind.

42:02.414 --> 42:07.076
I came to Coarsegold to be married.
And that's what I'm gonna be. Married.

42:07.252 --> 42:11.119
- Well, good luck, then.
- All the happiness in the world.

42:17.137 --> 42:19.011
Welcome to Coarsegold.

42:19.181 --> 42:21.553
This seems to be the place to find it.

42:24.477 --> 42:26.387
You might be in for a big surprise.

42:26.563 --> 42:29.315
How do you know Billy boy
still wants to marry you?

42:29.482 --> 42:32.851
- What do you care?
- I don't.

42:59.387 --> 43:00.716
This the Hammond claim?

43:00.889 --> 43:04.222
- Who wants to know?
- I do. I'm looking for Billy Hammond.

43:04.726 --> 43:06.719
You found him.

43:06.895 --> 43:08.095
Billy!

43:09.731 --> 43:11.474
Howdy, Elsa!

43:11.650 --> 43:13.559
I can't believe it, honey.

43:14.528 --> 43:18.656
Looks like the girl he's been
going down the mountain to see.

43:19.241 --> 43:22.906
I'll say one thing,
she's sure worth the trip.

43:23.245 --> 43:25.570
Wish I'd got there first.

43:25.997 --> 43:28.073
Looks like a warm one.

43:29.543 --> 43:32.912
- Hey, where's your pa at?
- Back home.

43:33.338 --> 43:36.837
You mean you run off and come
all the way up here just to see me?

43:37.592 --> 43:39.170
See you?

43:39.845 --> 43:42.929
I brought my mother's wedding dress.

43:43.098 --> 43:45.090
- If you still want to.
- If I want to?

43:45.267 --> 43:47.840
If he don't, you got four others
to choose from.

43:48.019 --> 43:51.186
Sweet thing like you
ought to have the pick of the litter.

43:51.356 --> 43:54.310
- No rush about making up your mind.
- Don't listen.

43:54.484 --> 43:56.940
We're gonna get married tonight.

43:58.154 --> 44:00.443
I guess that will be all, Mr. Longtree.

44:03.285 --> 44:05.242
By the way...

44:06.037 --> 44:08.659
...just who is Mr. Longtree?

44:08.832 --> 44:10.955
I rode up with him from the farm.

44:13.795 --> 44:19.300
- That's a couple of days on the trail.
- That's right. Two days, two nights.

44:19.467 --> 44:21.294
A couple of nights.

44:21.469 --> 44:24.305
A couple of nights on the trail.

44:26.683 --> 44:27.883
Billy!

44:28.977 --> 44:32.144
There were two other men with us
from the bank in town.

44:32.564 --> 44:37.060
Besides, Mr. Longtree
was a perfect gentleman.

44:37.235 --> 44:39.228
How come? Something wrong with him?

44:39.404 --> 44:45.489
Well, now, I don't think I ever met
a perfect gentleman before, Mr. Longtree.

44:56.087 --> 45:00.334
You come back and see us real
soon now, you hear, Mr. Longtree?

45:14.856 --> 45:20.776
Jimmy, Sylvus, Elder, come on down
here. I want you to meet my woman.

45:21.821 --> 45:23.399
Come on.

45:23.698 --> 45:27.032
Elsa, honey, this is Jimmy.
He's the baby of the family.

45:27.536 --> 45:31.035
And that's Sylvus. He's been doing
our cooking, as you can see.

45:31.206 --> 45:34.871
And the one on the end is Elder.
He's the head of the clan.

45:35.043 --> 45:40.797
I want you to meet my favorite brother.
Henry! Get down here now! Come on.

45:40.966 --> 45:44.050
Henry's sort of our banker,
you might say.

45:44.761 --> 45:46.967
Come on, honey, I'll show you my tent.

46:33.101 --> 46:35.853
It looks like you've got
a pretty good claim.

46:37.772 --> 46:41.141
It's a gold mine. Why don't
you come over and take a look.

46:41.318 --> 46:43.441
You're invited too.

46:53.163 --> 46:55.202
- Find Billy Hammond?
- Yeah.

46:55.373 --> 46:56.654
What's he like?

46:56.833 --> 47:00.332
What difference does it make?
She wanted him, now she's got him.

47:00.503 --> 47:01.702
I don't want a shave.

47:01.880 --> 47:05.379
Well, Jimmy, you're gonna get shaved
whether you want to or not.

47:05.550 --> 47:09.085
You've been running around
with that peach fuzz long enough.

47:09.262 --> 47:12.927
We want that girl to know
she's marrying into a family of men.

47:16.311 --> 47:18.102
Hey, Billy.

47:21.107 --> 47:23.147
Thank you, Sylvus.

47:26.112 --> 47:27.904
Now haul it.

47:28.198 --> 47:29.609
What's that for?

47:29.783 --> 47:31.657
You're leaving.

47:34.996 --> 47:38.745
I see no sense in moving out
just because you're honeymooning.

47:38.917 --> 47:43.080
I don't have time to explain it to you,
brother. Just get out.

47:45.090 --> 47:46.881
I ain't going.

47:54.099 --> 47:55.973
You just did.

48:02.691 --> 48:04.730
Takes care of him.

48:09.614 --> 48:12.948
- I gotta clean up in here.
- Plenty of time for that later.

48:13.118 --> 48:17.365
- No. I wanna do it now.
- No, you don't.

48:18.915 --> 48:22.450
- But the place is filthy.
- It'll wait. It'll wait.

48:22.627 --> 48:24.750
Let go, Billy.

48:24.963 --> 48:28.332
- Billy, let me go!
- All right.

48:30.218 --> 48:32.045
Calm down.

48:33.555 --> 48:35.631
Come on, honey.

48:36.725 --> 48:38.717
See you later.

48:43.356 --> 48:45.515
If you need any help...

48:45.692 --> 48:49.108
...fastening up your wedding dress,
you just holler, you hear?

48:49.279 --> 48:51.153
I'll manage.

48:54.743 --> 48:57.697
First drink is best, east or west.

48:58.079 --> 49:01.164
- Let him go. Turn him loose.
- There we go.

49:01.333 --> 49:03.491
Jimmy, we're gonna make
a man of you now.

49:03.668 --> 49:05.328
Say, Henry.

49:05.670 --> 49:09.668
I've been wanting to ask you something.
Something's been on my mind.

49:09.841 --> 49:12.628
Was you planning to bathe
for the wedding?

49:12.969 --> 49:14.569
No, sir.

49:16.264 --> 49:19.431
You ain't gonna clean up
for your brother's wedding?

49:20.810 --> 49:22.684
No, sir, I ain't.

49:22.854 --> 49:26.389
I didn't wash when cousin
got wed back home.

49:27.234 --> 49:31.397
That bride didn't seem to mind none.
Did she, Billy?

49:32.739 --> 49:35.147
Now there'll be none of that.

49:35.784 --> 49:37.611
None of what?

49:43.333 --> 49:45.906
You know something, Sylvus?

49:46.086 --> 49:49.419
Billy is getting small-minded
about that woman.

49:49.589 --> 49:50.918
And a might feisty.

49:51.091 --> 49:53.961
A few drinks under his belt,
he'll change his mind.

49:54.135 --> 49:57.136
Now, liquor always did have
a softening effect on Billy.

49:57.305 --> 49:59.927
I hate to get married
with one of my brothers...

50:00.100 --> 50:02.472
...smelling bad enough to gag a dog.

50:02.644 --> 50:04.637
Yeah, that so?

50:04.813 --> 50:09.274
You wouldn't want that sweet thing to
think we're less than quality, would you?

50:09.818 --> 50:12.356
The only thing I know
is that after tonight...

50:12.529 --> 50:15.732
...she ain't gonna be able
to think enough about me.

50:24.416 --> 50:26.289
Get him in there.

50:33.008 --> 50:34.502
All right, let him up.

50:37.846 --> 50:39.388
- Henry. Henry.
- Henry.

50:39.556 --> 50:41.299
- Come on now, Henry.
- Easy now.

50:41.474 --> 50:44.179
- We're just funning you, Henry.
- Come on, Henry.

50:44.352 --> 50:45.515
- Easy.
- Come on, Henry.

50:45.687 --> 50:48.260
Put the knife up now.
You're gonna cut yourself.

50:48.440 --> 50:50.563
Is that a smile I see on his face?

50:54.362 --> 50:56.770
Easy now, Henry.

52:10.522 --> 52:12.598
Come on, boys.

52:30.125 --> 52:32.201
Drink to the bride!

52:36.298 --> 52:38.290
Let's have a drink.

52:49.394 --> 52:51.766
Stand up, judge. Here comes the bride.

52:51.938 --> 52:54.773
Come on. Steady now.

53:01.990 --> 53:06.486
Here she is, folks, my bride-to-be.
Elsa, this here's Judge Tolliver.

53:07.621 --> 53:10.408
Pleased to make your acquaintance,
my dear.

53:10.582 --> 53:13.037
And that there's Kate.
She's your bridesmaid.

53:13.210 --> 53:15.167
Welcome to Kate's Place, honey.

53:15.337 --> 53:21.422
And these ladies over here
are Sam and Rose and Belle and Candy.

53:21.593 --> 53:25.341
- We're your flower girls, honey.
- You're beautiful, girls. Beautiful.

53:25.514 --> 53:27.008
Aren't they beautiful, Elsa?

53:31.686 --> 53:33.893
Let her roll, Charlie!

54:08.557 --> 54:09.755
Drinks on the house!

54:11.643 --> 54:16.850
You come on over and sit down, honey.
You must be tired. Poor baby.

54:17.023 --> 54:20.772
We'll all of us have a little drinkie
before the formalities.

54:24.573 --> 54:28.617
Now, you take this. Don't be afraid.
It'll do you good.

54:28.785 --> 54:30.694
Cheers, Elsa.

54:44.134 --> 54:45.134
Heck.

54:47.512 --> 54:51.261
Eleven thousand,
four hundred and eighty-six.

54:51.433 --> 54:53.840
That's a far cry
from a quarter of a million.

54:54.019 --> 54:56.095
Fortunes of war.

54:57.814 --> 54:59.356
Hardly worth it.

54:59.524 --> 55:02.311
All depends on where you stand.

55:03.570 --> 55:05.397
I guess that's right.

55:05.572 --> 55:09.949
To a poor man, 11,000
is just as far away as 250,000.

55:13.538 --> 55:17.666
- Where are you going?
- Out for some fresh air. Any objections?

55:18.293 --> 55:23.714
We're gathered here in the high mountains
in the presence of this august company...

55:24.466 --> 55:29.044
...to join this man and this woman
in matrimony.

55:29.221 --> 55:34.760
Now, I'm not a man of the cloth,
and this is not a religious ceremony.

55:34.935 --> 55:37.342
It's a civil marriage.

55:37.604 --> 55:42.147
But it's not to be entered
into unadvisedly...

55:42.317 --> 55:44.986
...but reverently and soberly.

55:45.570 --> 55:50.232
A good marriage has a kind
of simple glory about it.

55:50.408 --> 55:55.366
A good marriage is like a rare animal.
It's hard to find.

55:55.539 --> 55:58.160
It's almost impossible to keep.

55:59.042 --> 56:01.367
You see, people change.

56:01.545 --> 56:05.079
That's important for you to know
at the beginning.

56:05.257 --> 56:06.502
People change.

56:08.635 --> 56:12.846
The glory of a good marriage
don't come at the beginning.

56:14.391 --> 56:16.514
It comes later on.

56:17.018 --> 56:18.928
It's hard work.

56:20.105 --> 56:24.268
Billy, do you take this woman
to be your lawful-wedded wife...

56:24.442 --> 56:27.894
...until God, by death, shall separate you?
- I do.

56:29.447 --> 56:31.107
And do...?

56:31.283 --> 56:32.528
What's your name again?

56:33.702 --> 56:34.947
Elsa Knudsen.

56:35.120 --> 56:39.449
Do you, Elsa, promise to take this man
to be your lawful-wedded husband...

56:39.624 --> 56:41.831
...until death does separate you?

56:43.795 --> 56:44.795
I do.

56:48.216 --> 56:50.090
Do you have a ring?

56:53.263 --> 56:58.055
Then, by the authority vested in me,
I hereby pronounce you man and wife.

57:04.065 --> 57:07.185
All right, girls, change your clothes.

57:16.745 --> 57:19.283
Henry! Henry, Henry!

57:21.082 --> 57:23.787
No, no. Sylvus, Sylvus.
Now that's enough, Sylvus.

57:44.481 --> 57:47.601
Hey, bartender, pour a little more.

57:48.443 --> 57:51.942
No use standing here
tormenting yourself, son.

57:52.322 --> 57:54.279
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

57:54.449 --> 57:55.647
What a party!

58:03.708 --> 58:07.327
Come on, Billy. Come on, get over there
and get acquainted around.

58:16.471 --> 58:19.045
Let me in there. Let me in there.

58:21.226 --> 58:23.978
- Have fun, honey.
- Billy!

58:26.481 --> 58:27.679
Billy!

58:28.942 --> 58:32.145
Come on, now. It's my turn, Sylvus.

58:32.612 --> 58:34.688
- I told you not to do that!
- Now, wait.

58:34.865 --> 58:36.193
You had your turn.

58:36.366 --> 58:39.569
It looks like Jimmy's making a man
out of himself.

58:41.997 --> 58:45.413
- I told you not to do that!
- Now, don't be like that, Sylvus.

58:46.334 --> 58:47.615
Oh, come on now.

58:47.794 --> 58:51.377
Now, Sylvus, we got a nice party.
Why don't you behave yourself.

58:51.548 --> 58:52.876
You can't hit my brother!

58:57.846 --> 58:59.637
Don't leave me.

59:02.684 --> 59:05.009
I wish I'd known more
about those brothers.

59:05.187 --> 59:06.847
It's too late now.

59:07.314 --> 59:10.433
- She's married.
- Glad they didn't invite me.

59:10.609 --> 59:13.016
I always cry at weddings.

59:13.195 --> 59:17.572
The more I am around you, the more
I can do without your sense of humor.

59:17.741 --> 59:20.279
Come on, break it up!
Boys, get over there!

59:20.452 --> 59:23.488
Now I said, break it up,
and I mean it. Get over there.

59:23.663 --> 59:26.664
Come on, Sylvus, get over here
and behave yourself.

59:26.833 --> 59:28.625
Get over there!

59:33.548 --> 59:35.920
- No, Billy.
- Come on.

59:36.218 --> 59:37.218
No.

59:40.722 --> 59:43.047
Well, now, get on in there!

59:53.276 --> 59:55.648
Easy now, Elsa.

59:56.279 --> 59:58.817
- Listen, Elsa, you come here!
- No, Billy!

59:58.990 --> 01:00:02.905
No, Billy! No! Not here!

01:00:03.411 --> 01:00:05.071
No, Billy!

01:00:05.247 --> 01:00:08.247
Now, you straighten out,
you hear me?

01:00:22.889 --> 01:00:24.846
Where's Billy?

01:00:28.228 --> 01:00:29.936
I've got some prying brothers.

01:00:47.289 --> 01:00:49.246
You stay here.

01:00:50.458 --> 01:00:52.665
She's mine. She's mine. Let go, Henry.

01:00:52.836 --> 01:00:55.623
- Elsa!
- Henry, turn loose of me!

01:00:55.797 --> 01:00:57.956
I'm gonna get you.

01:00:59.342 --> 01:01:02.129
- Come back, Elsa. Come back.
- Come back, girl.

01:01:04.556 --> 01:01:07.759
Come on, get your bride.
Billy, get your bride.

01:01:16.318 --> 01:01:17.895
Hold it!

01:01:20.989 --> 01:01:22.946
Let her go.

01:01:33.793 --> 01:01:36.794
- Where are you going with my wife?
- She'll stay with us.

01:01:36.963 --> 01:01:41.175
- I'm taking her to her father tomorrow.
- Like hell she will.

01:01:46.473 --> 01:01:50.720
- You can't take a wife from her husband.
- Clear case of breaking and entering.

01:01:52.270 --> 01:01:56.897
- Elsa's legally married to Billy. Right?
- I now pronounce you man and wife.

01:01:57.609 --> 01:02:00.729
- And don't you forget it.
- Go along, Elsa.

01:02:01.738 --> 01:02:02.738
Heck.

01:02:06.993 --> 01:02:10.409
You're not leaving this camp with her.
I'll promise you that.

01:02:21.299 --> 01:02:22.710
Go home, Billy.

01:02:24.427 --> 01:02:26.883
What happened? You all right, Billy?

01:02:27.055 --> 01:02:30.305
Where is she? Where is she?
I'll kill him. I'll kill him.

01:02:30.475 --> 01:02:32.551
- Billy!
- Where'd he go with her?

01:02:32.727 --> 01:02:36.179
- Come on.
- Why'd you let him get away with her?

01:02:42.904 --> 01:02:46.154
The marriage didn't work.
We have to take her to her father.

01:02:46.324 --> 01:02:50.702
- We've got our hands full already.
- I don't like it any better than you do.

01:03:00.922 --> 01:03:02.749
Too big, huh?

01:03:21.943 --> 01:03:23.437
What are they doing there?

01:03:23.612 --> 01:03:27.526
We're willing to abide
by the court's decision if you are.

01:03:30.493 --> 01:03:31.738
We'll abide.

01:03:32.454 --> 01:03:34.446
Don't be scared.

01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:50.795
- What's wrong?
- Billy Hammond wants Elsa.

01:03:50.972 --> 01:03:53.298
They appointed a miners' court
to decide it.

01:03:53.475 --> 01:03:56.144
- Miners' court?
- That's the law, places like this.

01:03:56.311 --> 01:03:58.268
- Who says?
- They do.

01:03:58.438 --> 01:04:01.273
And there's a lot more of them
than there are of us.

01:04:01.441 --> 01:04:05.439
Billy's very sorry. Swears it
won't happen again. I believe him.

01:04:05.612 --> 01:04:08.648
- I wouldn't believe Billy...
- I don't wanna go back.

01:04:08.823 --> 01:04:11.397
You were legally married
of your own free will.

01:04:11.826 --> 01:04:14.863
Please. You can't let him
take me back. You can't.

01:04:15.038 --> 01:04:17.956
But whatever they decide,
that will have to be it.

01:04:18.124 --> 01:04:22.205
That don't have to be it. She's not
going with him. She stays with us.

01:04:22.379 --> 01:04:25.249
She stays here!
We're packing gold, not petticoats.

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:28.378
If she stays, I stay.

01:04:32.889 --> 01:04:35.380
Well, let's hope the court
lets her go with us.

01:04:35.559 --> 01:04:38.346
Otherwise, we'll be a little short-handed.

01:04:53.493 --> 01:04:56.660
All right, gentlemen, we can proceed.

01:04:56.830 --> 01:05:01.824
In the first place, I married this gal here
last night, up on the hill in Kate's Place.

01:05:02.002 --> 01:05:05.038
- You saw Judge...
- Where can I find Judge Tolliver?

01:05:05.213 --> 01:05:09.163
- At the end of the hall, mister.
- He married us legal and proper.

01:05:29.738 --> 01:05:31.730
Easy. Sit up.

01:05:31.907 --> 01:05:33.615
A little more.

01:05:53.178 --> 01:05:55.336
Thank you, sir.

01:05:56.556 --> 01:05:58.015
What can I do for you?

01:05:58.183 --> 01:06:00.590
Clear up a little technicality,
if you will.

01:06:00.769 --> 01:06:03.260
About that marriage last night.

01:06:03.438 --> 01:06:07.187
They're holding a miners' court.
They'll wanna know if it was legal.

01:06:08.109 --> 01:06:10.647
- Of course it was legal.
- Well, I believe that.

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:14.106
But the court may want proof,
in the form of a license.

01:06:14.282 --> 01:06:15.942
You got one?

01:06:29.965 --> 01:06:32.752
Signed by the governor of California.

01:06:32.926 --> 01:06:36.971
Yes, sir, there's no question at all
about the legality of this document.

01:06:37.722 --> 01:06:40.392
Now, when you testify
before that miners' court...

01:06:40.559 --> 01:06:42.432
...I'm gonna ask you one question:

01:06:42.602 --> 01:06:45.936
"Do you possess a license
to marry people in California?"

01:06:46.106 --> 01:06:49.890
And you're gonna answer, "No."
Am I clear?

01:06:50.819 --> 01:06:54.152
- That's a lie.
- No, it isn't. You don't possess it. I do.

01:06:54.322 --> 01:06:56.279
- Now, see here...
- Listen to me!

01:06:56.449 --> 01:06:58.987
You're gonna do as you're told.
Understand?

01:07:01.246 --> 01:07:06.453
Now, do you recall the question
I'm gonna ask?

01:07:07.377 --> 01:07:09.286
And what do you answer?

01:07:09.462 --> 01:07:10.462
No.

01:07:11.339 --> 01:07:13.332
Very good.

01:07:13.758 --> 01:07:15.383
Let's go.

01:08:12.442 --> 01:08:15.609
According to the law,
she's still married to Billy Hammond.

01:08:15.779 --> 01:08:18.566
You and the law.
She can get it nullified.

01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:21.408
Will that satisfy
your ironbound code of ethics?

01:08:21.576 --> 01:08:24.743
My code satisfies pretty easy, partner.

01:08:24.912 --> 01:08:28.661
Would it surprise you to know
that I was once a lawbreaker?

01:08:28.832 --> 01:08:32.249
Well, bless my stars.

01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:37.462
About the age of that boy back there.
Skinny as a snake and just about as mean.

01:08:37.634 --> 01:08:39.710
Ran with the Hole-in-the-Wall bunch.

01:08:39.886 --> 01:08:43.718
Gun-happy, looking for trouble
or a pretty ankle.

01:08:43.974 --> 01:08:46.429
Had the world by the tail,
so to speak.

01:08:46.852 --> 01:08:49.520
Then one night,
Paul Staniford picked me up.

01:08:49.688 --> 01:08:51.764
He was sheriff of Madera County then.

01:08:51.939 --> 01:08:56.151
There'd been a fight, and I was drunk.
Sicker than a fat dog.

01:08:56.444 --> 01:08:59.279
He dried me out in jail,
and then we went out back...

01:08:59.447 --> 01:09:03.066
...and he proceeded to kick
the bitter hell right out of me.

01:09:03.285 --> 01:09:04.908
That took some doing.

01:09:05.078 --> 01:09:08.328
Not much. You see,
he was right, I was wrong.

01:09:08.497 --> 01:09:10.407
That makes the difference.

01:09:10.584 --> 01:09:12.243
Who says so?

01:09:12.419 --> 01:09:15.336
Nobody. That's something
you just know.

01:09:15.505 --> 01:09:19.834
Anyhow, when I was able to walk again,
I realized I'd learned a lesson from him.

01:09:20.301 --> 01:09:22.010
The value of self-respect.

01:09:22.179 --> 01:09:24.255
What's that worth on the open market?

01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:28.381
Nothing to some people,
but a great deal to me.

01:09:28.643 --> 01:09:30.138
But I lost it.

01:09:30.312 --> 01:09:34.475
These last years, the only work
I was able to get was places like Kate's.

01:09:34.649 --> 01:09:37.567
Bartender, stick man, bouncer,
what have you.

01:09:37.736 --> 01:09:39.978
Not much to brag on.

01:09:40.404 --> 01:09:43.240
Now I'm getting back
a little respect for myself.

01:09:43.408 --> 01:09:47.821
I intend to keep it with the help of you
and that boy back there.

01:09:48.662 --> 01:09:51.830
- Good to be working again, Gil.
- Yeah.

01:09:52.292 --> 01:09:55.328
You know what's on the back
of a poor man when he dies?

01:09:55.503 --> 01:09:56.998
The clothes of pride.

01:09:57.547 --> 01:10:02.339
And they're not a bit warmer to him dead
than they were when he was alive.

01:10:05.514 --> 01:10:07.590
Is that all you want, Steve?

01:10:10.435 --> 01:10:14.515
All I want is to enter my house justified.

01:10:22.364 --> 01:10:24.107
Thank you.

01:10:24.866 --> 01:10:27.571
Will you stay in town
when we get back?

01:10:29.788 --> 01:10:32.361
I'm not just certain. Why?

01:10:44.553 --> 01:10:48.550
You're right, kid. I've been wasting
my breath. Tonight we move.

01:10:49.015 --> 01:10:51.886
- I don't know.
- You don't know what?

01:10:52.227 --> 01:10:54.932
I started out thinking
he was an old mossback...

01:10:55.105 --> 01:10:58.474
...but I changed my mind.
Kind of hate to turn against him.

01:10:58.650 --> 01:11:00.477
Are you with me or not?

01:11:00.652 --> 01:11:03.404
- What will happen to Elsa?
- He'll deliver her.

01:11:03.572 --> 01:11:07.652
The thing for you to remember
is that we made a deal.

01:11:08.076 --> 01:11:09.736
Yes, sir.

01:12:00.795 --> 01:12:03.168
It all pointed this way.

01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:07.800
All that talk about old Doc Franklin,
ungrateful citizens.

01:12:07.969 --> 01:12:11.967
- What we had coming but never got paid.
- It's the truth, isn't it, Steve?

01:12:12.224 --> 01:12:16.802
I knew in my bones what you were
aiming for, but I wouldn't believe it.

01:12:16.978 --> 01:12:19.304
I kept telling myself
you were a good man.

01:12:20.482 --> 01:12:23.649
- You were my friend.
- This is bank money, not yours.

01:12:23.818 --> 01:12:26.107
And what they don't know
won't hurt them.

01:12:26.279 --> 01:12:28.568
Not them. Only me!

01:12:32.536 --> 01:12:35.869
Take off your gun belt
and toss it over here.

01:12:43.421 --> 01:12:45.129
What are you gonna do?

01:12:55.684 --> 01:12:59.266
You always fancied yourself
faster than me.

01:12:59.896 --> 01:13:02.138
Go ahead, draw.

01:13:02.524 --> 01:13:04.600
Draw, you damned tinhorn!

01:13:17.581 --> 01:13:19.241
That was your second mistake...

01:13:19.416 --> 01:13:22.452
...and the last chance
you'll ever get from me.

01:13:22.878 --> 01:13:26.044
I'm gonna put you behind bars, Gil.

01:13:26.214 --> 01:13:28.207
You'll play hell getting it done.

01:13:28.842 --> 01:13:29.842
Move!

01:14:22.437 --> 01:14:25.189
My, oh, my, will you look who's here.

01:14:25.357 --> 01:14:30.482
Howdy. You made pure fools out of us,
stealing that license from Tolliver.

01:14:30.654 --> 01:14:33.738
The judge says there's another one
on file in Sacramento.

01:14:33.907 --> 01:14:37.490
That means she's still my wife.
Come on, honey, let's go home.

01:14:37.661 --> 01:14:39.653
She stays with us.

01:14:40.205 --> 01:14:42.826
Looks to me like you been
having some trouble.

01:14:42.999 --> 01:14:47.626
Looks to me like somebody got
their finger caught in the cookie jar.

01:14:47.796 --> 01:14:51.379
You're short-handed, old-timer,
but she's all we want.

01:14:52.092 --> 01:14:54.797
All we want,
provided we get her now.

01:14:54.970 --> 01:14:57.805
- You heard me.
- We'll get her, sooner or later.

01:14:57.973 --> 01:14:59.348
Like hell you will!

01:15:00.976 --> 01:15:03.680
You better cut yourself a switch,
Mr. Longtree.

01:15:03.854 --> 01:15:06.771
I don't think you
could handle me barehanded.

01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:10.558
You all are gonna get yourself
a chance to try, directly.

01:15:11.319 --> 01:15:12.919
Come on.

01:15:20.161 --> 01:15:23.328
I have your word you'll return
your gun when this is over?

01:15:23.498 --> 01:15:25.657
Yes, sir, I reckon you do.

01:15:28.670 --> 01:15:32.121
- I'll go along.
- You bet you'll go along.

01:15:32.299 --> 01:15:34.338
- We're moving into the rocks.
- Steve!

01:15:34.509 --> 01:15:37.214
Shut up! Move!

01:15:37.971 --> 01:15:39.771
Move out!

01:16:29.481 --> 01:16:31.557
You're really showing your age.

01:16:31.733 --> 01:16:36.229
Back in the old days, you'd have checked
those rifles before we left camp.

01:16:40.575 --> 01:16:42.900
I'll get around behind them.

01:16:46.373 --> 01:16:48.745
Don't waste your time.
They're too far away.

01:16:54.089 --> 01:16:57.624
He's going around behind us.
Cut me loose and give me a gun.

01:16:57.842 --> 01:17:00.084
I'll get a rifle for you.

01:17:03.056 --> 01:17:04.883
Start shooting.

01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:38.085
Sylvus!

01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:39.712
Sylvus!

01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:17.038
- He was carrying a rifle.
- Let's get out of here!

01:18:32.521 --> 01:18:36.435
- Looks like they got Sylvus.
- I know that. Come on! We're getting out.

01:18:36.608 --> 01:18:40.475
You got two brothers dead,
you talk about running?

01:18:40.654 --> 01:18:42.029
Come on!

01:19:20.902 --> 01:19:22.978
I wonder where those other three went.

01:19:23.154 --> 01:19:26.737
- I hope they're not still following us.
- Calm your fears, honey.

01:19:26.908 --> 01:19:30.324
My guess is, they gave up
and went back to Coarsegold.

01:19:31.246 --> 01:19:34.081
Assuming that's so,
I'll have your gun back.

01:19:42.132 --> 01:19:43.840
Do you hear me, boy?

01:19:54.769 --> 01:19:58.055
I'm sorry, Mr. Judd.
I guess I was showing off.

01:20:02.068 --> 01:20:05.235
- What happens when we get to town?
- It's up to the sheriff.

01:20:05.405 --> 01:20:09.533
He's turning us in.
You know that. So do I.

01:20:15.957 --> 01:20:18.579
- Ever hear of Folsom Prison, Heck?
- No.

01:20:18.752 --> 01:20:20.543
Well, it's solid rock.

01:20:20.712 --> 01:20:23.285
During the years we spend there
we'll discuss...

01:20:23.465 --> 01:20:26.631
...the events of the past few minutes
at great length.

01:20:26.801 --> 01:20:31.048
And by the time you get out, you won't
like him any better than I do now...

01:20:31.223 --> 01:20:33.974
...which isn't one hell of a lot.
Where do I sleep?

01:20:34.518 --> 01:20:37.933
Up there. I don't wanna see you
till breakfast.

01:20:45.111 --> 01:20:46.356
Cut me loose, Steve.

01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:49.240
Why?

01:20:52.452 --> 01:20:54.658
Because I don't sleep so good anymore.

01:21:09.845 --> 01:21:12.514
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:21:19.938 --> 01:21:23.141
My father says
there's only right and wrong...

01:21:23.567 --> 01:21:25.643
...good and evil.

01:21:26.027 --> 01:21:28.186
Nothing in between.

01:21:29.322 --> 01:21:34.364
- It isn't that simple, is it?
- No, it isn't. It should be, but it isn't.

01:21:34.536 --> 01:21:36.825
What's gonna happen to him?

01:21:37.163 --> 01:21:41.825
The boy? I'll testify for him.
They shouldn't be too hard.

01:21:42.627 --> 01:21:45.249
Will you testify for Mr. Westrum?

01:21:46.089 --> 01:21:49.173
- No, I won't.
- Why?

01:21:50.218 --> 01:21:51.712
Because he was my friend.

01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:54.711
- How come he don't tie us up?
- What for?

01:21:54.890 --> 01:21:56.882
No place to go.

01:21:57.058 --> 01:22:00.890
He's got the horses,
and he's got the guns.

01:22:01.062 --> 01:22:04.597
And it wouldn't take long
for Steve Judd to find us.

01:22:05.066 --> 01:22:07.439
Wait a minute, kid.
I just had a thought.

01:22:07.611 --> 01:22:11.774
Well, keep it to yourself.
I'm fed up with you and your ideas.

01:22:19.122 --> 01:22:21.079
That's all right.

01:22:24.711 --> 01:22:26.419
That's all right.

01:22:39.434 --> 01:22:41.427
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:22:41.937 --> 01:22:44.344
- Where's Gil?
- Gone.

01:22:46.441 --> 01:22:47.983
Why didn't you go with him?

01:22:48.777 --> 01:22:52.312
Because I didn't see any future
in our partnership.

01:23:44.708 --> 01:23:46.308
Come on.

01:23:46.501 --> 01:23:48.410
Get up there!

01:24:19.159 --> 01:24:21.033
You wait here.

01:24:21.494 --> 01:24:24.199
I'll go down and take a look around.

01:24:40.388 --> 01:24:44.600
- The old gent's taking quite a chance.
- I don't think so.

01:24:44.768 --> 01:24:46.725
Neither does he.

01:24:48.647 --> 01:24:51.731
I never figured
it would turn out this way.

01:24:52.943 --> 01:24:57.486
Chances are I'll be locked up for a while.
I've got no call to bring it up.

01:24:57.656 --> 01:25:00.147
- But maybe when I get out...
- I'll be there.

01:25:21.429 --> 01:25:23.802
I saw your father. Everything's all right.

01:26:39.174 --> 01:26:41.001
What are you doing?

01:27:16.586 --> 01:27:19.457
- That's strange.
- What?

01:27:19.798 --> 01:27:22.882
He goes to her grave every day
but always in the morning.

01:27:23.051 --> 01:27:24.545
Never in the afternoon.

01:27:27.472 --> 01:27:29.631
We're going to the ditch.

01:27:29.808 --> 01:27:30.808
Now!

01:27:48.660 --> 01:27:50.902
I walked right into it.

01:27:52.747 --> 01:27:55.073
I'm gonna try for the corral.

01:28:41.296 --> 01:28:42.838
I got him.

01:29:01.149 --> 01:29:03.142
Well, where's the rifle?

01:29:04.819 --> 01:29:06.064
On the horse.

01:29:10.242 --> 01:29:11.242
Bad?

01:29:12.077 --> 01:29:13.654
Not yet.

01:29:18.333 --> 01:29:20.539
Partner, what do you think?

01:29:22.796 --> 01:29:27.007
Let's meet them head-on, halfway,
just like always.

01:29:27.175 --> 01:29:29.583
My sentiments exactly.

01:29:29.761 --> 01:29:32.845
- You, Hammonds!
- What do you want, old man?

01:29:33.139 --> 01:29:36.343
He wants a shovel and six feet of dirt.

01:29:36.518 --> 01:29:38.724
You redneck peckerwoods.

01:29:38.895 --> 01:29:42.395
You're too chicken-gutted
to finish this thing out in the open.

01:29:47.737 --> 01:29:50.525
Two old men
against all three of you boys.

01:29:50.699 --> 01:29:54.862
And if them odds ain't enough for you
damned dry-gulching Southern trash...

01:29:55.036 --> 01:29:58.951
...we'll send out the girl.
- We're coming!

01:29:59.124 --> 01:30:01.366
- You hear me, Henry?
- Yeah, I hear you.

01:30:01.543 --> 01:30:03.868
You don't have to ask me twice!

01:30:04.379 --> 01:30:06.537
Now, you hold on, Billy.

01:30:06.715 --> 01:30:11.673
- We'll catch them when they raise up.
- Ain't you got no sense of family honor?

01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:16.776
Start the ball, old man.

01:31:48.859 --> 01:31:50.981
How'd we figure?

01:31:51.194 --> 01:31:54.148
- A thousand dollars a shot?
- Yeah.

01:31:55.156 --> 01:31:58.276
Those boys sure made me
a lot of money.

01:32:01.246 --> 01:32:03.819
They put them all in one spot.

01:32:09.087 --> 01:32:11.922
I don't want them to see this.

01:32:13.466 --> 01:32:15.589
I'll go it alone.

01:32:26.146 --> 01:32:28.518
Don't worry about anything.

01:32:29.274 --> 01:32:32.725
I'll take care of it,
just like you would have.

01:32:34.654 --> 01:32:36.896
Hell, I know that.

01:32:37.073 --> 01:32:39.232
I always did.

01:32:39.868 --> 01:32:43.035
You just forgot it for a while, that's all.

01:32:46.082 --> 01:32:48.538
So long, partner.

01:32:57.886 --> 01:32:59.843
I'll see you later.

01:33:44.578 --> 01:33:46.142
