As Lucifer's tracker,
I've born witness

00:21.756 --> 00:26.458
to the battle between heaven and
hell since the dawn of man.

00:26.460 --> 00:31.330
Desiring to grow his kingdom,
Lucifer decided to offer

00:31.332 --> 00:34.466
deals to those who have
not yet been judged.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.702
Returning them to their
bodies, they are permitted

00:36.704 --> 00:39.738
to take vengeance on the
person who wronged them.

00:39.740 --> 00:45.477
These Earth-bound demons
are known as omen.

00:45.479 --> 00:49.181
However, once they murder
their victims, they revert

00:49.183 --> 00:54.353
to human form, and their
soul is damned to hell

00:54.355 --> 00:57.823
forever, where an angel
of death named Zathera

00:57.825 --> 01:00.726
remained quite
curious of the living.

01:01.661 --> 01:05.364
In the west during 1860,
an outlaw named Grant

01:05.366 --> 01:09.234
Dillon became obsessed
with stories of Zathera.

01:09.236 --> 01:12.304
His ultimate goal was to
make her power his own.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.840
He learned of artifacts
scattered around the desert

01:14.842 --> 01:19.178
that would enable Zathera
to possess a human body.

01:19.180 --> 01:22.748
They would also give him the
ability to control her.

One of these ruins lay
hidden beneath a homestead.

01:26.220 --> 01:31.256

sell, Dillon resorted to...

01:31.258 --> 01:32.658
Other means.

Leaving their youngest
son Cody near death,

listen to him.

01:08:02.145 --> 01:08:04.245
He's telling the truth.

01:08:04.247 --> 01:08:06.247
This coming from the
second least trustworthy

01:08:06.249 --> 01:08:07.816
man in the room.

01:08:09.552 --> 01:08:11.653
Ok. Third.

01:08:11.655 --> 01:08:13.321
Make it good.

01:08:13.323 --> 01:08:18.193
I dug up all the land
underneath your ranch.

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:20.595
Still couldn't find what's
supposed to be there.

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:23.163
And what was
supposed to be there?

01:08:23.166 --> 01:08:26.201
Well, a rare metal that
when embedded into the

01:08:26.203 --> 01:08:28.403
human vessel of a demon
or angel can prevent them

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:31.473
from calling upon any power
that they just might possess.

01:08:31.475 --> 01:08:35.276
Like, what you did to Cody
at the sheriff's office?

01:08:35.278 --> 01:08:37.511
Nah, th-this is
way stronger.

01:08:37.514 --> 01:08:39.481
Something that would
work against somebody as

01:08:39.483 --> 01:08:41.582
powerful as Zathera.

01:08:41.585 --> 01:08:43.417
It was supposed to be
my ace in the hole.

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:45.819
But if you couldn't find
it, what good is it to us?

01:08:48.756 --> 01:08:52.594
As of last night, I got it.

01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:54.836
And if you know what's good
for you, you'll give it back!

01:08:57.899 --> 01:09:00.135
Why should I believe you?

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:01.536
Just trying to
make things right.

01:09:01.537 --> 01:09:03.470
That's all, Lane.

01:09:03.473 --> 01:09:05.640
We need to talk.

01:09:10.212 --> 01:09:13.348
I know what this coin
means to you.

01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:17.285
It looks like we're gonna have
to melt it down to a bullet.

01:09:17.287 --> 01:09:19.154
You better get to it.

01:09:19.156 --> 01:09:21.421
Fires already burning.

01:09:23.826 --> 01:09:26.461
Hawk, go get those
chains from my horse.

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:28.729
Why do I always
gotta do everything?

01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:37.171
Magnificent, isn't she!

01:09:37.907 --> 01:09:40.575
You understand the only
reason I haven't ripped

01:09:40.577 --> 01:09:44.712
your head off and sent you
screaming back to hell.

01:09:44.714 --> 01:09:46.680
I need something from you.

01:09:46.683 --> 01:09:48.283
Be my first guess.

01:09:48.285 --> 01:09:50.218
Since you the only one who
can track Zathera through

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:51.853
fire, here's my offer.

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:56.324
You help McCrae stop her,
and I'll give you a two

01:09:56.326 --> 01:09:59.427
day head start before
sending him after you.

01:09:59.429 --> 01:10:01.396
What do you say?

01:10:01.398 --> 01:10:04.566
If I'm gonna do this
thing for you,

01:10:04.568 --> 01:10:08.503
I'm gonna need a little bit
more than a head start.

01:10:19.348 --> 01:10:22.283
Now don't struggle with it,
it'll just make it worse.

01:10:22.285 --> 01:10:25.353
We'll take 'em off as soon
as we're ready to leave.

01:12:27.609 --> 01:12:31.846
Lane, for what it's worth, I'm
sorry the way things went down.

01:12:40.622 --> 01:12:42.056
Who you trying to kid, Dillon?

01:12:42.958 --> 01:12:44.859
You ain't sorry in the least!

01:12:45.627 --> 01:12:48.963
Only thing you're sorry about
is that you got caught!

01:12:56.138 --> 01:12:59.107
How did you get like this, huh?

01:12:59.109 --> 01:13:02.643
You, me, and Cody grew up
together for Christ's sake!

01:13:02.645 --> 01:13:05.747
You sat down at our table!

01:13:06.482 --> 01:13:08.850
My ma fed you when there
was barely enough

01:13:08.852 --> 01:13:11.018
for her own family!

01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:13.488
And you gunned her down!

01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:15.656
- And...
- Save a piece of him for me!

01:13:15.658 --> 01:13:16.724
Son of a bitch!

01:13:16.726 --> 01:13:19.060
Hey! Stop!

01:13:19.062 --> 01:13:20.895
You're killing him.

01:13:27.136 --> 01:13:28.770
Ugh...

01:13:29.905 --> 01:13:33.474
Power is intoxicating anyway.

01:13:35.043 --> 01:13:37.011
You cannot believe it.

01:13:37.013 --> 01:13:40.915
Once you tasted it,
there ain't no going back.

01:13:42.584 --> 01:13:45.987
You're right. I don't
understand, and I never will.

01:13:47.022 --> 01:13:51.859
You step out of line
even a little bit,

01:13:51.861 --> 01:13:53.995
and I swear to god...

01:13:53.997 --> 01:13:55.863
I won't think twice
about putting this bullet

01:13:55.865 --> 01:13:58.433
right between your eyes.

01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:03.538
I'm worth more to
you alive than dead.

01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:06.040
Don't bet on it.

01:14:18.487 --> 01:14:20.188
Keep an eye on him.

01:14:22.724 --> 01:14:26.127
Just being in the same room
with him makes me sick.

01:14:36.171 --> 01:14:38.005
- What is it, Liz?
- There's a way.

01:14:38.007 --> 01:14:39.674
A way for what?

01:14:39.676 --> 01:14:43.211
That guy Dillon's
with, he had your job.

01:14:43.213 --> 01:14:45.179
Somehow he's been managing
to give the devil the slip

01:14:45.181 --> 01:14:46.614
for years.

01:14:46.616 --> 01:14:48.683
You really wanna have
this conversation now?

01:14:48.685 --> 01:14:50.551
Did you see the
massacre over there?

01:14:50.553 --> 01:14:53.754
If we don't stop her, there
won't be a solitary person left.

01:14:53.756 --> 01:14:55.590
How can you even think
about me right now?

01:14:55.592 --> 01:14:58.793
'Cause I care about
you, you damned idiot.

01:14:59.728 --> 01:15:01.629
Forget it.

01:15:01.631 --> 01:15:03.231
Forget I even said anything.

01:15:03.233 --> 01:15:05.666
Hold on a second!

01:15:13.275 --> 01:15:15.176
- Liz.
- Your word.

01:15:15.178 --> 01:15:18.679
You never break it, right?

01:15:18.681 --> 01:15:20.548
No.

01:15:20.949 --> 01:15:23.284
Now promise me, Lane.

01:15:23.286 --> 01:15:27.989
Whatever happens, no matter
if we're together or not,

01:15:27.991 --> 01:15:33.094
you'll find a way to remove
that mark and be free.

01:15:33.096 --> 01:15:34.862
Promise me, Lane!

01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:37.965
I would stop hounding
you 'til you do!

01:15:37.967 --> 01:15:40.301
I know that's true.

01:15:43.639 --> 01:15:45.706
Alright.

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:47.174
I promise.

01:15:48.744 --> 01:15:50.978
Well alright then.

01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:53.814
I'm gonna go check on
Dillon and Cody.

01:16:13.302 --> 01:16:18.873
Love is an incredible thing,
isn't it, Mr. McCrae.

01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:26.814
It can heal the oldest and
the deepest of wounds,

01:16:26.816 --> 01:16:30.184
but yet, it can
cause grander ones.

01:16:30.186 --> 01:16:31.686
Who are you?

01:16:31.688 --> 01:16:34.889
The real question
is, who are you?

01:16:34.891 --> 01:16:36.857
The concerned brother?

01:16:36.859 --> 01:16:39.126
Humanity's savior?

01:16:39.128 --> 01:16:42.797
Or simply, the Devil's whore?

01:16:44.032 --> 01:16:45.266
What do you want?

01:16:45.268 --> 01:16:47.602
Tell me of your faith.

01:16:47.604 --> 01:16:49.036
Not much to talk about.

01:16:49.038 --> 01:16:51.172
How long do you think it
will take before you beg

01:16:51.174 --> 01:16:53.874
for God's forgiveness?

01:16:57.613 --> 01:17:05.219
So, your boss has just
been idly sitting by,

01:17:05.221 --> 01:17:07.822
waiting to hear my confession?

01:17:07.824 --> 01:17:10.791
God is ready to
grant you redemption.

01:17:14.696 --> 01:17:16.230
He didn't lift a finger to
help my family when they

01:17:16.232 --> 01:17:18.399
were being slaughtered.

01:17:18.401 --> 01:17:21.268
And now you expect me to
believe he just wants to

01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:24.171
grant me forgiveness
with nothing in return.

01:17:24.173 --> 01:17:26.040
There is something.

01:17:26.042 --> 01:17:28.743
You must let Zathera succeed.

01:17:28.745 --> 01:17:30.144
Are you insane?

01:17:30.146 --> 01:17:32.380
She'll wipe out the
whole damned world!

01:17:32.382 --> 01:17:33.381
Yes.

01:17:33.383 --> 01:17:35.082
The world is damned.

01:17:35.084 --> 01:17:37.852
The Devil has worked very
hard to create chaos on

01:17:37.854 --> 01:17:40.154
Earth and it is time
for a cleansing.

01:17:40.156 --> 01:17:42.757
A cleansing?

01:17:42.759 --> 01:17:46.227
You expect me to just sit back
and let Zathera murder everyone?

01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:48.295
Your soul will be protected.

01:17:52.768 --> 01:17:54.135
I don't know.

01:17:54.137 --> 01:17:57.071
This is where your
faith must prevail.

01:17:57.073 --> 01:17:59.073
Now you must make the
hard choice based on

01:17:59.075 --> 01:18:01.042
your trust in God.

01:18:01.044 --> 01:18:03.444
You must make your
decision soon.

01:18:03.446 --> 01:18:05.680
Time is running against you.

01:18:05.682 --> 01:18:07.181
Yeah, what else is new.

01:18:07.183 --> 01:18:11.052
A loner you may be, Lane McCrae,
but in times of peril,

01:18:11.054 --> 01:18:15.122
placing your faith in others
may be the only way.

01:18:21.797 --> 01:18:22.963
Tempting offer.

01:18:22.965 --> 01:18:24.932
Yeah!

01:18:24.934 --> 01:18:26.801
But I got a better one.

01:18:26.803 --> 01:18:28.335
I'll bet you do.

01:18:28.337 --> 01:18:32.740
You stop Zathera, and I'll
make it worth your while!

01:18:32.742 --> 01:18:34.341
Come on, look around you.

01:18:34.343 --> 01:18:36.811
Look how far humanity has
come, and you wanna send

01:18:36.813 --> 01:18:38.879
it back to the stone ages!

01:18:38.881 --> 01:18:41.115
I mean sure there's
gonna be anarchy,

01:18:41.117 --> 01:18:43.417
but there's also beauty.

01:18:43.419 --> 01:18:46.153
And I'm leaving it all alone.

01:18:46.155 --> 01:18:51.459
They'll always exist, no matter
how many times God starts over.

01:18:51.461 --> 01:18:54.829
Humans are prone to temptation.

01:18:54.831 --> 01:18:56.130
It's in their nature.

01:18:56.132 --> 01:18:57.932
Tell you what.

01:18:57.934 --> 01:19:00.034
I'll even sweeten the pot.

01:19:00.036 --> 01:19:06.373
Stop Zathera, and I'll make sure
Cody's soul is never damned.

01:19:06.375 --> 01:19:10.177
He won't see a single
day of torment in Hell.

01:19:10.179 --> 01:19:12.379
How can you wager Cody's soul?

01:19:12.381 --> 01:19:14.448
You don't even...

01:19:38.874 --> 01:19:40.374
Wasn't someone watching him?

01:19:40.376 --> 01:19:42.943
You called us out back, Lane.

01:19:42.945 --> 01:19:44.411
It wasn't me.

01:19:46.548 --> 01:19:48.282
What'd she say?

01:19:50.286 --> 01:19:53.487
Now, about that deal?

01:20:09.104 --> 01:20:10.471
That's the last one.

01:20:10.473 --> 01:20:13.174
What do we do with all
the rifles and stuff?

01:20:13.176 --> 01:20:15.142
We'll give the army a week.

01:20:15.144 --> 01:20:17.845
And if they don't
come back for 'em.

01:20:17.847 --> 01:20:20.581
Well, I guess, we can sell 'em.
