01:39.933 --> 01:43.020
Seems like the perfect
holiday for the Faitelsons.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.898
I'm sure that it is life-changing.

01:45.981 --> 01:49.443
Yeah, well, I'd rather backpack than
end up on some fancy wine tour.

01:49.526 --> 01:51.028
Well, and you can't ride a bike.

01:52.237 --> 01:53.238
Fuck you.

01:53.322 --> 01:56.950
- Jean, it's been too long.
- Oh, hey, Allen.

01:57.034 --> 01:59.203
Congrats on the new grandson.

02:00.037 --> 02:01.914
- You did a great job with this.
- Thank you.

02:01.997 --> 02:04.208
Well, Michael did a
wonderful job in Texas.

02:04.291 --> 02:05.584
- Aw, thank you.
- I heard.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.312
You guys looking at the Burgundy trip?

02:07.390 --> 02:08.503
Ah, well...

02:08.529 --> 02:11.280
No, I think Jean wants
to rough it more.

02:11.340 --> 02:15.010
I think maybe an ashram in India,
or something or a silent retreat.

02:15.093 --> 02:17.721
[Jean] I never said that.
He's being ridiculous.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.765
- She's thinking it, though.
- [laughing]

02:21.391 --> 02:23.977
- [Allen whispers]
- [Michael] Okay. All right.

02:29.441 --> 02:32.945
Okay, um, have you had enough
small talk with my colleagues?

02:33.028 --> 02:35.489
Oh, you know how I like
to play the perfect wife.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.157
You do a very good job of it.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.022
[Michael] Mm.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.091
Did you see, um...

02:54.174 --> 02:56.385
Hey, Alexis. You look beautiful.

02:56.468 --> 02:58.011
You too, Jean.

02:58.095 --> 02:59.596
- [Michael] Hey.
- Hi.

03:00.305 --> 03:01.515
Enjoying the party?

03:02.332 --> 03:03.392
Yeah, I mean,

03:03.475 --> 03:06.436
I don't know half the people
here, but it's an open bar.

03:07.104 --> 03:08.689
My attitude exactly.

03:09.189 --> 03:12.526
It sounds like you guys had
fun in Texas, at least.

03:12.609 --> 03:14.861
Yeah. It was pretty uneventful.

03:14.945 --> 03:18.782
Yeah, it was, you know, work, hotel...

03:19.700 --> 03:22.995
Still, must be nice to be in
the middle of nowhere, right?

03:23.453 --> 03:25.372
Yeah, I guess.

03:29.334 --> 03:30.752
- Hey, honey. Um...
- Yes?

03:30.836 --> 03:32.887
- Can you grab me another?
- Yeah.

03:32.912 --> 03:33.964
- Yeah.
- Okay.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.841
Looks like Alexis needs one, too.

03:36.592 --> 03:37.843
- All right.
- Thanks, honey.

03:37.926 --> 03:38.969
Okay.

03:43.307 --> 03:45.058
- [Jean] How are you?
- [Alexis] Good.

03:47.269 --> 03:48.645
Oh, wow.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.314
[Alexis] Wish I could afford that.

03:50.397 --> 03:53.567
- It's so evocative, right?
- Yeah.

03:54.026 --> 03:55.043
[shutter clicks]

03:56.028 --> 03:58.488
So, how's the writing coming along?

03:58.864 --> 04:01.658
Michael mentioned that you
were pursuing it on the side.

04:01.742 --> 04:05.078
Yeah. Good, actually. I, um...

04:05.162 --> 04:08.005
I just found out that one of my stories
is going to be in n+1 magazine.

04:08.068 --> 04:09.082
Wow.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.543
It's kind of like an
indie version of Salon.

04:11.627 --> 04:14.463
Honey, did you know Alexis's story
is going to be in a magazine?

04:14.546 --> 04:17.841
- Oh. Oh, well, congratulations.
- Thank you.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.219
- Yeah.
- It's, um, it's the one you read.

04:20.302 --> 04:22.053
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- About my dad.

04:22.471 --> 04:24.348
[nervous chuckle]

04:24.465 --> 04:25.599
- [Alexis] Cheers.
- Cheers.

04:25.682 --> 04:27.267
[Jean] Congratulations.

04:27.351 --> 04:30.020
That's, uh, fantastic.

04:30.854 --> 04:34.191
Oh, it's Bill and Leslie. I
didn't say hello. Would you mind?

04:34.274 --> 04:37.194
- Sorry. Excuse us, sorry. Okay.
- Of course.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.654
- I'll see you later?
- Yeah.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.074
[chattering]

05:07.850 --> 05:09.726
When did you read Alexis's story?

05:09.810 --> 05:13.397
A couple of weeks ago. She wanted me
to give her some feedback, but...

05:14.439 --> 05:17.317
- I'd like to read it.
- Oh, really?

05:17.734 --> 05:19.486
Since when are you
into creative writing?

05:21.363 --> 05:23.782
Maybe I'm into a lot of
things you don't know about.

05:23.866 --> 05:27.786
I'm sure that you are. At this
point, nothing would surprise me.

05:32.416 --> 05:33.667
[exhales]

05:36.962 --> 05:39.131
Do you ever wonder what your
life would've been like

05:39.214 --> 05:40.883
if you'd ended up with Catherine?

05:40.966 --> 05:42.217
No.

05:43.594 --> 05:44.678
No.

05:45.762 --> 05:46.763
No!

05:46.847 --> 05:48.307
What's bringing this up?

05:49.433 --> 05:50.976
I don't know. Just...

05:51.894 --> 05:54.271
You used to be a major stoner back then.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.815
Used to smoke all the time, right?

05:57.733 --> 06:00.819
- Just made me think of her.
- You rejected me.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.779
And I was dulling the pain.

06:02.863 --> 06:07.576
No. You fell hard for her.
Nearly killed me.

06:07.659 --> 06:09.995
I thought about you the whole time.

06:10.078 --> 06:13.165
Yeah, right. Even during sex?

06:16.585 --> 06:18.212
Especially during sex.

06:18.295 --> 06:19.713
[laughing]

06:22.007 --> 06:24.509
You always know what to say, don't you?

06:28.138 --> 06:29.264
[Michael] Mm-hmm.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.823
[exhaling]

07:03.173 --> 07:04.799
[Michael grunts]

07:04.883 --> 07:06.009
- Are you okay?
- Yep.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.177
[Michael sighs]

07:07.261 --> 07:08.720
- I got it.
- No, no...

07:08.804 --> 07:10.180
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.475
- [Michael grunts]
- [groans] Honey.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.144
[Jean sighs]

07:18.772 --> 07:20.357
[sighs]

07:22.734 --> 07:23.861
What?

07:25.362 --> 07:27.781
I guess I'm just really tired.

07:29.575 --> 07:30.576
Oh.

07:31.794 --> 07:32.828
Yeah.

07:32.911 --> 07:33.954
[laughs]

07:34.580 --> 07:37.165
- Yeah, me too.
- And full.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.669
Yeah, well, I'm dying to get to bed.

07:43.380 --> 07:44.840
We'll reschedule.

07:46.633 --> 07:47.676
Okay.

07:53.891 --> 07:54.892
Oops.

07:57.895 --> 07:58.979
Sexy.

08:51.281 --> 08:53.658
[Jean chattering]

09:03.752 --> 09:06.421
- It's cool, right?
- [Sidney] Yeah, I love it.

09:06.505 --> 09:08.549
It's so evocative.

09:10.634 --> 09:12.886
Mm, well, it sounds like
you had a fun night.

09:14.012 --> 09:16.181
Though, you didn't send
me a picture of yourself.

09:18.267 --> 09:19.268
Hold on.

09:30.571 --> 09:31.613
[phone chimes]

09:40.998 --> 09:43.542
- Where are you?
- Home. What do you mean?

09:46.503 --> 09:48.463
When can I finally come over?

09:48.547 --> 09:51.717
- Whenever you want.
- [Sidney laughs] Bullshit.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.635
No, seriously.

09:54.135 --> 09:57.180
I was thinking tomorrow night?

09:57.764 --> 09:58.932
What's your address?

10:00.267 --> 10:04.062
It's 309 West 81st Street.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.527
- What?
- Nothing. I, uh...

10:11.653 --> 10:13.405
I almost dropped my phone in the bath.

10:14.823 --> 10:16.867
- You're in the bath?
- [Sidney] Yeah.

10:18.869 --> 10:20.746
Now I'm picturing you.

10:20.829 --> 10:23.665
I'm scrubbing coffee
grinds out my cuticles.

10:24.333 --> 10:25.751
Super sexy.

10:28.170 --> 10:29.922
Self-care, it's important.

10:31.548 --> 10:32.799
Thanks, Mom.

10:33.383 --> 10:34.968
Mothers know best.

10:35.427 --> 10:37.596
- Do they?
- It's what they say.

10:39.348 --> 10:40.933
I really don't care what people say,

10:41.016 --> 10:43.644
I just don't understand why
you can't come here...

10:43.727 --> 10:44.811
right now.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.231
I mean...

10:49.191 --> 10:50.984
I might have to touch myself.

10:53.070 --> 10:54.404
Oh, God.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.950
Give me a consolation prize.

11:01.411 --> 11:02.454
Like what?

11:02.537 --> 11:04.205
Your last name.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.210
Hart.

11:25.060 --> 11:27.688
I told you. I'm not on social media.

11:28.271 --> 11:30.607
Yeah, yeah. You're a
fucking ghost, I know.

11:39.658 --> 11:41.118
Well, it's too bad.

11:42.286 --> 11:44.580
I would've let you watch, but...

11:45.956 --> 11:48.125
I guess you'll just have
to wait till tomorrow.

12:17.779 --> 12:18.780
[shudders]

12:35.338 --> 12:36.798
- [Jean sighs]
- [door closes]

13:28.684 --> 13:32.187
[Claire] "The two most important days
in your life are the day you're born..."

13:32.271 --> 13:33.897
and the day you find out why."

13:36.441 --> 13:37.734
Mark Twain said that.

13:38.652 --> 13:41.822
And Zane ended our
meditation with that quote.

13:41.905 --> 13:44.575
And all of a sudden, everything
came into perspective.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.827
The purpose of my life.

13:47.202 --> 13:48.954
- Which is?
- To give.

13:49.955 --> 13:51.874
Not unlike yours, actually.

13:52.791 --> 13:58.213
I mean, when Rob left my neighbor
Pat, I took her in for two months.

13:58.297 --> 14:01.633
Let her stay in my guest room, 'cause
I didn't want her to be alone.

14:01.717 --> 14:05.554
And I made her oatmeal every
morning, and I took care of her.

14:06.597 --> 14:07.723
Well, that's great, Claire.

14:07.806 --> 14:09.766
- It's good to be giving.
- Yeah.

14:09.850 --> 14:13.979
But it's also healthy to have
your own needs. We all do.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.940
But, ultimately, by serving
others, we serve ourselves.

14:17.524 --> 14:20.068
And by accepting myself as I have,

14:20.527 --> 14:22.196
honestly, truthfully,

14:22.613 --> 14:24.198
I hope my daughter will accept me.

14:24.281 --> 14:26.408
Hmm. I have the same hope.

14:27.159 --> 14:28.160
So...

14:28.577 --> 14:32.998
I have been telling her about my work
in here and my work in meditation.

14:33.332 --> 14:35.125
You know, the whole "letting go" thing.

14:35.834 --> 14:38.587
And she has agreed to see me!

14:39.129 --> 14:42.257
[Jean] That's great news.
I'm really happy for you.

14:42.341 --> 14:47.971
[Claire] Yeah, so I wanted to know how
we could work out some time with you.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.934
What for?

14:52.726 --> 14:56.563
Well, I mean, she wants to come
in and do a session with me,

14:56.647 --> 15:01.902
and do you remember at the beginning
of our work, you suggested it?

15:01.985 --> 15:02.986
Right.

15:03.487 --> 15:05.113
And I feel you're the only person

15:05.197 --> 15:07.783
who could do this healing
process with us, Jean.

15:10.327 --> 15:13.330
Right. Of course. Um...

15:15.207 --> 15:17.918
It's just I'm not really, uh...

15:18.001 --> 15:19.795
an unbiased source anymore.

15:19.878 --> 15:23.340
I'm very much a part of your
journey, your perspective, and...

15:24.091 --> 15:27.678
I wouldn't want Rebecca
to feel attacked.

15:28.720 --> 15:32.307
I think it would be good for the
two of you to see someone...

15:33.100 --> 15:34.726
that can be fair to both of you.

15:34.810 --> 15:36.645
I'm not very comfortable with that.

15:37.228 --> 15:40.398
- I understand, but...
- Jean...

15:41.608 --> 15:43.151
I really need this.

15:47.114 --> 15:48.115
Okay.

15:49.700 --> 15:53.203
If you truly think Rebecca
will be open to it,

15:53.954 --> 15:55.998
let's... let's do it.

15:56.331 --> 16:00.627
- You mean it?
- Against my better judgment, yes.

16:06.091 --> 16:07.634
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:08.343 --> 16:10.679
- Can we talk for a sec?
- Sure, what's up?

16:11.305 --> 16:14.224
I don't want you to panic,
but it's a little troubling.

16:14.308 --> 16:15.767
Oh, no. Is something wrong?

16:16.058 --> 16:17.143
Well, it's about Texas.

16:17.895 --> 16:20.856
Uh, if they are recanting
their statements again,

16:20.938 --> 16:23.453
- I'm telling you, I am not...
- No. Nothing about the case.

16:23.513 --> 16:24.890
Oh, okay.

16:25.735 --> 16:28.529
- It's about your assistant.
- Alexis?

16:28.614 --> 16:31.783
Apparently, there's a story
going around that you...

16:34.369 --> 16:36.330
were intimate on the trip.

16:36.997 --> 16:38.040
Are you kidding?

16:39.583 --> 16:40.601
Wow.

16:41.793 --> 16:44.213
Okay. Listen.

16:47.049 --> 16:48.425
Look, Allen, I would tell you.

16:48.509 --> 16:50.052
I consider you to be a friend.

16:50.135 --> 16:53.597
I would own up to it and
tell you if I fucked up.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.641
I mean, that happens to
people all the time.

16:57.267 --> 16:58.268
Nothing...

16:59.211 --> 17:00.229
like that happened.

17:00.312 --> 17:01.330
Okay.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.565
Then it's a non-issue. Just
wanted to hear from you.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.236
Well, I appreciate you
coming to me directly.

17:07.903 --> 17:08.904
Of course.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.549
Hi, Rebecca. It's Diane.

17:30.133 --> 17:32.803
Listen, I need to speak to you. Um...

17:33.470 --> 17:36.413
It's a long story. Can you call
me back when you get a chance?

17:36.468 --> 17:37.474
Thanks.

17:37.558 --> 17:38.617
[knock on door]

17:39.309 --> 17:40.435
Hey, come in.

17:45.232 --> 17:46.567
I have to talk to you.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.085
Yeah?

17:50.487 --> 17:53.031
- You missed it.
- What?

17:53.614 --> 17:55.032
My a capella show.

17:58.036 --> 18:01.582
- Oh, fuck, Lar.
- It's fine. It's fine. I'm...

18:01.665 --> 18:05.043
- Honestly, I'm so over it by now.
- No, I'm so sorry.

18:05.127 --> 18:08.213
But, um, it did make me think...

18:08.881 --> 18:10.048
in general,

18:11.466 --> 18:13.218
you've been really absent.

18:16.513 --> 18:17.514
You're right.

18:19.016 --> 18:22.019
- I haven't been there.
- The more I think about it,

18:22.895 --> 18:26.440
how selfish you've been, how
addicted to your phone,

18:26.523 --> 18:29.818
or how you're just lost
in your own world...

18:30.694 --> 18:34.907
I realized that I
recognize this behavior.

18:36.033 --> 18:38.368
I remember the signs from Daryl.

18:38.994 --> 18:43.832
He was so aloof, and
he was so forgetful.

18:43.916 --> 18:48.378
- Operating like no one else existed.
- You know me.

18:49.254 --> 18:52.216
Larin, I'm not cheating on Michael.

18:53.091 --> 18:54.593
I couldn't do that.

18:55.384 --> 18:59.930
You remember how paralyzed I got
when things weren't good between us.

19:03.769 --> 19:08.273
But you're right. I haven't
been a good friend.

19:12.402 --> 19:13.437
Okay.

19:19.952 --> 19:21.203
[sighs]

19:44.977 --> 19:46.728
[whispering] What the fuck am I doing?

20:03.161 --> 20:07.499
So, I found many mentions in print,

20:08.250 --> 20:09.418
but no images.

20:09.501 --> 20:11.920
I told you, I like my privacy.

20:12.004 --> 20:15.215
Mmm. It's like you're not a real person.

20:15.883 --> 20:18.635
I mean, you have nothing out there.

20:22.806 --> 20:23.974
[Jean exhales]

20:25.559 --> 20:28.812
- Hey, delete that.
- Or what?

20:29.605 --> 20:30.647
I mean it.

20:30.731 --> 20:33.734
- Oh, you're cute when you're angry.
- I'm not fucking around.

20:35.861 --> 20:37.029
All right, fine.

20:38.906 --> 20:42.034
- Deleted it. See?
- Good.

20:44.745 --> 20:46.914
What the fuck happened to you?

20:47.664 --> 20:48.749
What do you mean?

20:49.833 --> 20:51.877
Something bad must have happened.

20:52.461 --> 20:53.537
I mean...

20:54.254 --> 20:58.884
you don't go AWOL with no attachments
if your life's been peachy keen.

20:58.967 --> 21:00.302
How do you know?

21:01.136 --> 21:03.847
I don't think you're a criminal, either.

21:05.265 --> 21:09.645
Yeah, well, I could probably rob
a bank and no one would notice.

21:10.187 --> 21:13.065
They might even hold the
door for me on the way out.

21:13.565 --> 21:15.984
- So you're invisible?
- Mm-hmm.

21:16.401 --> 21:19.530
And you think that means you can
do whatever the fuck you want?

21:19.947 --> 21:21.006
Doesn't it?

21:25.702 --> 21:27.663
Look, whatever it is, I don't care.

21:28.163 --> 21:31.708
With our lives and our jobs, we
could easily just hit the road.

21:35.045 --> 21:36.129
[Sidney chuckles]

21:39.675 --> 21:40.926
Where would we go?

21:43.595 --> 21:45.472
Have you ever been to Marfa?

21:46.390 --> 21:48.642
- No.
- Well...

21:51.436 --> 21:53.105
We can road trip there...

21:54.857 --> 21:56.233
fuck around.

21:57.359 --> 22:00.320
And then drive our car off a
cliff like Thelma & Louise.

22:03.282 --> 22:06.827
- Yeah, well, that's not how I'd do it.
- Oh, yeah?

22:07.077 --> 22:10.330
If you really want to
escape, you need a plan.

22:12.124 --> 22:16.420
I'd start by renting a Westfalia,

22:17.629 --> 22:21.800
send my apologies to my colleagues
for missing any deadlines,

22:23.092 --> 22:25.615
tell them I have a
second cousin's funeral

22:25.654 --> 22:27.873
that I have to attend in South Dakota.

22:28.387 --> 22:31.224
No, fuck it. South
Dakota's way too specific.

22:34.229 --> 22:38.817
Maybe Cleveland or outside Sacramento?

22:43.906 --> 22:47.242
And we'd go on a regular
week, not a holiday.

22:48.160 --> 22:49.453
And...

22:50.871 --> 22:55.209
that way, people would be consumed
with their real lives, their work.

22:56.877 --> 23:01.798
And then, I'd sell off all
my ex-husband's jewelry.

23:02.216 --> 23:05.594
The kind you can't wear
for emotional reasons.

23:06.845 --> 23:11.892
And then we'd burn through that
money with reckless abandon.

23:12.935 --> 23:14.394
[heavy breathing]

23:21.318 --> 23:23.362
Dude, you're taking way
too long on your breaks.

23:23.445 --> 23:24.780
Suck my dick.

23:51.306 --> 23:52.366
[Alexis chuckles]

23:53.141 --> 23:55.102
What did Allen wanna talk to you about?

23:55.185 --> 23:57.104
I need you to be honest with me, okay?

23:58.730 --> 24:01.567
- Should we go into your office?
- No, we shouldn't.

24:02.359 --> 24:03.861
That'll just make it worse.

24:04.610 --> 24:07.154
- [stammering] What worse?
- Did you tell anyone about Texas?

24:07.237 --> 24:10.991
- Of course not. What do you mean?
- Did you mention...

24:14.121 --> 24:15.789
anything about me...

24:16.582 --> 24:17.791
on our trip to anyone?

24:19.042 --> 24:20.252
Are you crazy?

24:21.253 --> 24:22.504
Why would I open my...

24:22.963 --> 24:24.047
mouth?

24:28.177 --> 24:32.723
Dan and Lena in accounting did
mention something similar at lunch.

24:32.922 --> 24:34.682
I thought they were just
making assumptions.

24:34.765 --> 24:36.809
They probably just
picked up on something.

24:36.892 --> 24:38.602
There's nothing to pick up on.

24:40.314 --> 24:43.025
- Right.
- Could you hand me that, uh...

24:43.108 --> 24:44.276
that file?

24:48.155 --> 24:50.908
- I'm gonna have to move your desk.
- Don't do that.

24:51.450 --> 24:53.577
That'll only make you look more guilty.

24:54.286 --> 24:56.788
- Make people more suspicious.
- I know that.

25:00.250 --> 25:02.836
We didn't even do anything.

25:02.920 --> 25:04.338
Doesn't matter.

25:05.881 --> 25:08.383
Now, it's basically the
same as if we did.

25:13.388 --> 25:14.973
[church bell ringing]

25:16.934 --> 25:19.811
- Hey! What's going on?
- Shh! It's okay.

25:20.312 --> 25:22.356
Hey, just wait a second. Tell me.

25:22.439 --> 25:24.775
I shouldn't have gone to
that fucking meeting, okay?

25:25.651 --> 25:27.277
Look, I'm not proud of myself.

25:28.529 --> 25:29.530
Did you?

25:30.989 --> 25:33.116
It was a moment of weakness. Okay?

25:33.200 --> 25:34.368
Couldn't help myself.

25:36.828 --> 25:38.705
- And you were with Tom?
- Yeah.

25:39.081 --> 25:41.625
Because I don't have
anywhere else to fucking go.

25:42.459 --> 25:45.212
Amber's boyfriend moved back in.
He's a raging alcoholic.

25:45.963 --> 25:47.506
I can't live with my mom.

25:49.758 --> 25:52.010
At least, with him, I
have somewhere to stay.

25:52.426 --> 25:54.344
I can sleep through the night.

25:55.138 --> 25:56.723
How do you walk away from that?

25:58.725 --> 26:01.353
Just to feel good for
one night is something.

26:01.769 --> 26:03.562
We could talk to your mom.

26:04.398 --> 26:06.316
Would that help, if I go with you?

26:06.398 --> 26:10.569
I told you I'm not ready. Don't push me.

26:12.406 --> 26:13.782
I won't push you.

26:15.617 --> 26:16.994
I'm sorry.

26:20.914 --> 26:24.209
I just want a chance to be a
real person in the world.

26:28.589 --> 26:29.590
Like you.

26:36.180 --> 26:39.516
- I'm only as real as you are.
- No, you're not.

26:41.643 --> 26:43.437
No, you got things.

26:44.354 --> 26:45.981
No, you got things!

26:46.355 --> 26:49.525
Imagine if you couldn't go home
to your fucking suburban life?

26:51.028 --> 26:53.363
- All right, I'm just gonna call him.
- No, hold on.

26:55.365 --> 26:56.366
Look...

26:58.160 --> 26:59.578
I have a solution.

27:00.078 --> 27:03.081
Just for a few days, until
we talk to your mom, okay?

27:06.543 --> 27:07.544
Please.

27:17.721 --> 27:19.181
What is this place?

27:20.390 --> 27:21.642
[door closes]

27:21.725 --> 27:22.976
It's a friend's.

27:24.436 --> 27:27.439
She's out of town, so
sometimes I check in on it.

27:30.651 --> 27:31.668
Diane?

27:36.573 --> 27:37.574
Yeah.

27:46.917 --> 27:48.168
Expensive looking.

27:54.925 --> 27:56.760
You know, I'm trusting you here.

28:06.687 --> 28:08.814
You really are a miracle worker.

28:08.897 --> 28:10.148
No, I'm not.

28:10.899 --> 28:13.485
My friend Drew, remember?
Her mom said the same.

28:15.487 --> 28:17.239
Maybe you're my magic pill.

28:17.990 --> 28:20.033
Well, I just wanna help.

28:21.201 --> 28:25.080
- It's my job.
- No. No one cares.

28:25.401 --> 28:26.435
They say they care.

28:26.479 --> 28:27.847
They look you in the eye and tell you

28:27.872 --> 28:30.026
that your problems
matter to them, but...

28:31.170 --> 28:34.840
Soon enough, they're back
debating what to watch on TV,

28:35.424 --> 28:37.301
what restaurant to eat at.

28:51.648 --> 28:53.942
I just want you to have a real chance.

28:54.985 --> 29:00.240
I don't want you going back to drugs
just because you don't have any options.

29:02.159 --> 29:04.703
You know, if I had a mom like
you, I'd give it all up.

29:41.571 --> 29:45.325
- Hey there, hot shot.
- Hey. What, you got groceries?

29:45.410 --> 29:48.330
Yeah, I was gonna make
some turkey meatballs.

29:48.413 --> 29:50.040
Oh, that sounds delicious.

29:50.499 --> 29:51.500
How was work?

29:51.583 --> 29:53.377
Um, it was good. It was good.

29:53.794 --> 29:56.839
[panting] Allen thought, you
know, we did a good job...

29:56.920 --> 29:59.047
in Texas, and he was happy
to see you the other day.

29:59.131 --> 30:01.174
[basketball dribbling]

30:05.137 --> 30:06.513
Looking good, mister.

30:44.887 --> 30:49.183
- [Dolly] What's your name?
- Oh, you know my name, honey.

30:49.641 --> 30:52.311
Mommy, I'm trying to memorize my lines.

30:52.394 --> 30:54.188
Oh, for the play.

30:55.479 --> 30:58.357
It's so hard when one minute I'm
Dolly, and the next, I'm Peter Pan.

30:58.440 --> 31:00.275
It's confusing.

31:00.360 --> 31:02.529
Well, it's acting. It's
supposed to be fun.

31:03.278 --> 31:05.781
And you get to pretend
to be someone else.

31:06.656 --> 31:07.691
Yeah.

31:09.786 --> 31:12.080
The best way is just
to go over and over it

31:12.164 --> 31:14.499
so much that you don't even
have to think about it.

31:15.042 --> 31:18.253
You know it so well, and
it's inside of you.

31:19.755 --> 31:22.132
You start to believe it yourself.

31:22.216 --> 31:24.301
- Can you read Wendy?
- Sure.

31:25.260 --> 31:26.320
What's your name?

31:27.137 --> 31:30.098
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.

31:31.598 --> 31:33.517
- What's yours?
- Peter Pan.

31:36.603 --> 31:37.604
Where do you live?

31:43.529 --> 31:44.571
I don't know.

32:58.643 --> 33:00.645
[heavy breathing]

33:02.649 --> 33:03.817
Look at me.

33:08.488 --> 33:12.326
- Look at me.
- I'm looking at you. What?

33:17.039 --> 33:18.832
[heavy breathing]

33:20.984 --> 33:22.044
Hey.

33:22.127 --> 33:23.921
[Sam] Things with Emily are really good.

33:25.172 --> 33:29.051
She's lost some weight and is
actually more adventurous.

33:29.968 --> 33:30.986
I mean...

33:32.429 --> 33:35.432
Last night, in the middle of
sex, she even slapped me.

33:38.727 --> 33:41.104
- How did you like it?
- The slap?

33:43.190 --> 33:45.609
I hadn't felt that way in a while. Um...

33:46.318 --> 33:48.695
- That kind of intensity.
- Hmm.

33:51.907 --> 33:53.367
Why do you think she did it?

33:53.825 --> 33:55.577
Guess she wanted to get my attention.

33:57.246 --> 33:59.039
And what were you thinking about?

34:02.543 --> 34:04.253
Um, I don't know.

34:05.128 --> 34:07.089
I was in the moment.

34:10.340 --> 34:12.801
Emily's really helping me move on.

34:13.679 --> 34:15.889
She doesn't even let me say
Sidney's name anymore.

34:16.974 --> 34:18.225
That's good, Sam.

34:19.601 --> 34:22.688
But as you pursue a
relationship with Emily,

34:22.771 --> 34:27.985
it's important that you continue working
on your unresolved feelings for Sidney.

34:28.068 --> 34:32.447
Right, but I'm over her. I don't
want to talk about her with you.

34:33.824 --> 34:35.158
You seem a little angry.

34:36.784 --> 34:39.871
Was there any aggression?

34:41.123 --> 34:43.876
Did things ever get physical
with you and Sidney?

34:47.838 --> 34:49.590
Depends what you mean by physical.

34:55.721 --> 34:57.347
Sidney calls it "good pain."

34:59.016 --> 35:01.414
When you're just toeing
that line between

35:01.482 --> 35:04.250
hurting and complete fucking ecstasy.

35:06.273 --> 35:09.193
I'm sure drug addicts get it when
they shoot up, I don't know.

35:12.237 --> 35:13.447
What did she do...

35:14.990 --> 35:16.533
to make you feel that way?

35:19.786 --> 35:20.829
[sighs]

35:26.126 --> 35:27.753
Well, she'd get mad at me, right?

35:29.213 --> 35:30.631
And then, we'd fight.

35:31.965 --> 35:35.928
And then, she'd say something
like she was gonna go...

35:37.679 --> 35:41.225
blow the guys at the bar
down on our street.

35:43.018 --> 35:46.772
Take them all home and make me watch
while she sucked them all off.

35:49.191 --> 35:50.984
And while she'd start to tell me this,

35:52.444 --> 35:53.946
she'd suck on my cock.

35:56.281 --> 35:57.491
It was crazy.

36:01.161 --> 36:02.579
How did you like it?

36:08.877 --> 36:11.421
Well, I never came as hard
as when we did it like that.

36:13.632 --> 36:16.134
It's sick, I know, but
I couldn't help it.

36:17.177 --> 36:19.012
And can I ask...

36:20.347 --> 36:25.060

I'm fucking happy.

36:55.121 --> 36:57.058

every time I fuck Emily?

36:57.092 --> 37:00.679

seem to have a lot of...

37:01.094 --> 37:03.221

helping you move on.

You know that, right?

37:54.066 --> 37:55.943

38:18.215 --> 38:21.176

38:21.260 --> 38:22.761
What kind of issues?

38:23.510 --> 38:25.929
Just been fighting a lot

38:26.012 --> 38:28.890

I've been on my phone so much.

38:29.810 --> 38:32.980
The other night, I was awake at
two a.m., and he wasn't in bed,

38:33.063 --> 38:37.276
and he was in the bathroom
talking to someone on the phone.

38:38.944 --> 38:40.195
Is it his assistant?

38:40.696 --> 38:42.865
Honestly, I don't know.

38:42.948 --> 38:46.243
I know he's interested. I
can tell from the way he...

38:47.411 --> 38:49.079
He tries to leave her out of stories.

38:49.162 --> 38:52.457
The way he forces himself
not to say her name.

38:52.541 --> 38:54.418

38:56.086 --> 38:57.838
That's so hard.

38:57.921 --> 39:00.716
I haven't even spoken to him yet.

39:01.800 --> 39:05.345
I don't know if he trusts me
after everything that went down.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.012
I mean, that's possible.

39:09.933 --> 39:12.967
When you shut someone out emotionally,

39:12.992 --> 39:16.505
you know, it's hard to
get the trust back.

39:17.983 --> 39:20.986
And you blurred so many boundaries.

39:22.154 --> 39:24.573
But I was protecting Melissa.

39:25.324 --> 39:27.951
I couldn't tell Michael
anything about it.

39:28.493 --> 39:31.205
It would be implicating him.
She's the patient.

39:31.786 --> 39:34.956
I get it, but you know,
somewhere along the way,

39:35.042 --> 39:36.251
Michael lost you.

39:36.335 --> 39:41.840
I get that's the price for doing
business, but it still has an effect.

- She gets out in about two weeks.
- Oh, yeah?

40:24.675 --> 40:27.469
We still haven't spoken, and
I'm actually a little worried.

40:27.550 --> 40:29.802
And she's still at Bellevue?

40:29.888 --> 40:33.267
Yeah. It's all pretty
intense for my family.

40:33.350 --> 40:36.270

something happened with me and Alexis.

Yeah, I heard that, too.

41:10.429 --> 41:11.763
Nothing happened, Scott.

41:13.849 --> 41:15.726
Oh, I wouldn't say "nothing."

You know I saw Alexis leaving
your room in the morning.

happy if Jennifer knew that.

41:24.757 --> 41:26.651
Why are you threatening me?
I didn't say shit.

41:26.734 --> 41:30.571

41:30.657 --> 41:33.035

41:45.756 --> 41:47.841
Tell me. Enlighten me, Scott.

41:48.634 --> 41:50.511
It is so obvious, dude.

41:51.678 --> 41:52.846
She's in love with you.

41:54.348 --> 41:57.100
She wants everyone to think
that you're fucking her.

41:58.185 --> 42:01.355
It's why she came to Texas. It's
probably why she fucked me.

42:04.566 --> 42:06.026

responsibility in this situation.

it my responsibility?

that trip and hanging out.

both feel about each other.

just trying to retrace my steps.

- No, actually.

45:42.159 --> 45:43.493

45:43.577 --> 45:46.455
I'm finally seeing my mother.

45:47.036 --> 45:50.122
Wow. That's great progress.

45:50.206 --> 45:55.211
Well, she's been insisting that I
join her in therapy for so long now.

45:55.294 --> 46:00.341
And I made some pretty big
life decisions. Seemed like...

46:00.424 --> 46:02.510
the right moment to get
things off my chest.

46:02.593 --> 46:05.972
What... what kind of decisions?

46:08.477 --> 46:09.478
Um...

46:11.227 --> 46:13.271
Dax and I are having a baby.

46:14.858 --> 46:19.029
But I just really need to
fully separate from my mother

46:19.110 --> 46:21.946
before I can become one myself.

46:23.575 --> 46:24.576
I, um...

46:26.203 --> 46:30.290
I actually... I wrote her a letter,
since I'll probably be too... nervous

46:30.374 --> 46:33.669
to say all this to her face the moment
that I'm looking her in the eye.

46:35.504 --> 46:38.507
A letter, that's... that's intense.

46:38.590 --> 46:41.760
Well, will you tell me
if this makes sense?

46:41.844 --> 46:43.220
Now I'm worried.

I forgive you,

46:56.567 --> 46:58.652
but it's partly 'cause I'm moving on.

47:00.776 --> 47:05.031
What I realize now is I can't
continue to work on me

47:05.114 --> 47:10.244
or fulfill my life's duties while I'm
still trying to take care of you.

Here's what's gonna happen.

mom to go through all the ways

47:40.646 --> 47:42.188
that you hurt her.

47:42.279 --> 47:44.907
And the truth is, it's
her therapist, so...

47:45.324 --> 47:48.869
even if she tries to be neutral,
it's always gonna be biased.

47:49.283 --> 47:50.954
I mean, she's been
treating her for what?

47:51.017 --> 47:52.025
