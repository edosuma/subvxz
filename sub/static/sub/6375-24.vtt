00:00.460 --> 00:03.540
The dreams always begin the same

00:03.580 --> 00:06.170
I'm eating a hot dog in a park

00:06.200 --> 00:08.920
And that's when I notice everyone is gone.

00:08.950 --> 00:12.660
- Weird. just then, I hear henry's voice. - Betty?

00:12.680 --> 00:14.870
I realize it's not henry, but...

00:14.900 --> 00:16.730
Antonio Sabato Jr.?

00:16.750 --> 00:18.560
Before I can do anything,

00:18.590 --> 00:20.810
Antonio rips the hot dog from my hand.

00:20.820 --> 00:23.000
No hot dog for you, Betty Suarez.

00:23.010 --> 00:25.010
And then he kisses me.

00:25.010 --> 00:28.010

00:28.010 --> 00:31.010
Joanna    ronald     sadnessleaf
honeybunny

00:34.240 --> 00:35.780
Matt?

00:35.800 --> 00:38.090
How could you, Betty? You betrayed me.

00:38.110 --> 00:40.280
You're a cheater. you kissed him.

00:40.330 --> 00:44.070
You kissed Antonio Sabato Jr. with tongue.

00:44.380 --> 00:46.830
You frenched Antonio Sabato Jr?

00:46.860 --> 00:48.140
Was it good?

00:48.180 --> 00:49.250
That's not the point.

00:49.270 --> 00:51.030
Obviously, he'Henry.

00:51.040 --> 00:53.390
Oh. So what's the hot dog?

00:53.410 --> 00:55.440
Also not the point.

00:55.460 --> 00:58.030
I think I have to tell Matt that I kissed Henry

00:58.060 --> 00:59.650
Before we move in together.

00:59.670 --> 01:01.760
Betty, I don't care how guilty you feel.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.580
Keep your piehole shut.

01:03.600 --> 01:06.630
Please tell me, what good is telling him?

01:06.660 --> 01:09.460
Well, I don't want there to be secrets between us,

01:09.480 --> 01:12.530
Especially when we're about to take things to another level.

01:12.550 --> 01:14.580
I mean, it's been three days already.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.860
Listen, if that kiss meant nothing,

01:16.880 --> 01:19.620
You're about to turn nothing into something.

01:19.650 --> 01:20.490
I don't know.

01:20.510 --> 01:22.950
Matt's coming home from his painter's retreat today.

01:22.980 --> 01:25.310
I'm just gonna tell him at lunch.

01:25.740 --> 01:26.780
Good morning.

01:26.800 --> 01:29.000
Hey. What are you doing up so early?

01:29.010 --> 01:32.260
The live media telecast of the Mama Award nominees.

01:32.280 --> 01:33.420
Oh, yeah.

01:33.450 --> 01:36.010
Oh, the Mama Awards-- am I nominated?

01:36.030 --> 01:38.770
The magazine and media association awards.

01:38.790 --> 01:40.500
Yeah, it's, like, my favorite awards show

01:40.520 --> 01:42.250
After the Oscars, the Tonys,

01:42.260 --> 01:44.040
The Golden Globes and the Grammys.

01:44.070 --> 01:47.800
Aw. My baby's so full of culture.

01:47.820 --> 01:49.180
You are so getting into

01:49.210 --> 01:50.850
That performing arts high school.

01:50.860 --> 01:53.000
Mom, it's too early for love.

01:53.050 --> 01:56.200
Nominees in the category of socially relevant article

01:56.230 --> 01:59.130
Are "anorexia's forgotten prisoners,"

01:59.160 --> 02:00.670
The "New York Review"...

02:00.720 --> 02:02.810
In honor of the Mama Awards,

02:02.830 --> 02:06.300
Your traditional one bite of bagel.

02:08.810 --> 02:10.229
Thank you.

02:10.250 --> 02:12.890
I assumed since you're off to work for "Vogue" now,

02:12.900 --> 02:14.370
You wouldn't be here this morning.

02:14.380 --> 02:17.020
Oh, Stop. My head may belong to Anna Wintour,

02:17.040 --> 02:20.220
But my heart will always belong to you

02:20.260 --> 02:22.610
And Jake Gyllenhaal-- but mostly you.

02:22.630 --> 02:24.610
And the nominees for best fashion issue of the year...

02:24.630 --> 02:26.630
That's our category.

02:26.630 --> 02:28.630
"Elle," spring fashion issue, march, 2009,

02:28.630 --> 02:31.040
Editor-in-chief Robbie Myers.

02:31.050 --> 02:33.240
"Mode" magazine, wedding issue...

02:33.260 --> 02:36.060
Editors-in-chief Daniel Meade and Wilhelmina Slater...

02:36.070 --> 02:37.850
Willie, it's your first nomination as editor-in-chief.

02:37.870 --> 02:41.230
Too bad I have to share it with that drooling idiot.

02:44.600 --> 02:46.310
Congratulations.

02:46.330 --> 02:49.740
You're nominated for a Mama for the wedding issue.

02:49.810 --> 02:51.580
Mm. that's cool.

02:51.600 --> 02:53.550
Cool?

02:53.580 --> 02:55.280
It's huge.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.540
Not to mention, I'm on the cover.

03:00.570 --> 03:03.780
Okay, that is definitely the best part.

03:03.810 --> 03:07.800
Wait, wait. you had a fever last night.

03:07.810 --> 03:09.710
You have to get back to sleep. Come on.

03:09.720 --> 03:11.510
I'm fine.

03:11.520 --> 03:14.630
And even better knowing... you're gonna win.

03:14.650 --> 03:16.180
Yeah. I can't wait--

03:16.200 --> 03:19.270
My husband on stage accepting his trophy.

03:20.920 --> 03:23.590
I am so proud of you, babe.

03:26.570 --> 03:29.300
Yay, Wilhelmina!

03:29.930 --> 03:31.770
All hail the nominee!

03:31.780 --> 03:34.670
Oh, this is all too much. you know I hate attention.

03:34.680 --> 03:36.690
- Brava, Willie. Brava. - Oh, you don't have to do that.

03:36.710 --> 03:39.860
- Keep doing that. - Marc, where is the press?

03:39.870 --> 03:42.480
Eagerly awaiting their queen.

03:45.590 --> 03:47.710
That's not their queen.

03:47.730 --> 03:49.280
Look at them fawning over her

03:49.310 --> 03:52.100
Like she's Obama's portuguese water dog.

03:52.110 --> 03:53.370
I think it's time we bust out

03:53.390 --> 03:54.990
That little secret we dug up.

03:55.010 --> 03:57.270
So are there any more questions

03:57.290 --> 03:58.860
Oh, I have one.

03:58.920 --> 04:00.990
Uh, I was thinking about taking a little vacation

04:01.010 --> 04:03.370
To Madison, South Dakota.

04:03.410 --> 04:06.980
I heard it's a wonderful place to find your inner child.

04:07.010 --> 04:11.890
Ever been there, recently, or maybe in the early '80s?

04:13.840 --> 04:16.980
I think we've had quite enough questions.

04:17.120 --> 04:19.630
Thank you all for coming.

04:19.649 --> 04:20.930
Thank you.

04:20.940 --> 04:23.010
What does she mean? what does she mean by that?

04:23.050 --> 04:24.530
Were you there at that time?

04:24.550 --> 04:26.070
I'm so sorry.

04:26.080 --> 04:28.640
You know how easily the elderly tire out.

04:28.650 --> 04:31.750
Now who wants to talk about my nomination?

04:31.770 --> 04:33.325
When did you find out?

04:33.325 --> 04:34.880
How did you share that with Daniel?

04:36.610 --> 04:39.150
Congratulations!

04:39.210 --> 04:41.420
Huh. That's... interesting.

04:41.430 --> 04:44.520
It's an "M" for Mama. You can't tell?

04:44.540 --> 04:46.780
A piece broke off.

04:46.800 --> 04:48.060
Okay, I ate it.

04:48.090 --> 04:49.905
Why aren't you out there doing any press?

04:49.905 --> 04:51.720
Oh, my mom's Senior V.P. now.

04:51.740 --> 04:53.650
I'll let her be the face of the company.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.610
I meant to ask you, has Penny Meadows turned in

04:55.620 --> 04:56.755
That Yves Saint Laurent piece yet?

04:56.755 --> 04:57.890
I haven't gotten anything.

04:57.910 --> 05:00.130
That's weird. She's been working on that for months now.

05:00.140 --> 05:01.610
I'm gonna need that for the fall issue.

05:01.630 --> 05:04.210
Can you go check and see how it's coming?

05:04.980 --> 05:08.440
- What? - It's just... she's mean...

05:08.490 --> 05:11.550
And scary and she always has terrible breath,

05:11.580 --> 05:13.190
Like coffee and moth balls

05:13.210 --> 05:15.890
And some other weird smell I can't quite figure out.

05:15.900 --> 05:18.110
Betty, she's not that bad.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.780
What the hell do you want, eyebrow?

05:20.800 --> 05:22.830
Good morning, Penny.

05:22.850 --> 05:25.540
Daniel was wondering about the Yves Saint Laurent piece.

05:25.560 --> 05:29.150
- Working on it. - Right, I understand. It's just--

05:29.160 --> 05:31.340
Look at those damn pigeons-- taunting me,

05:31.380 --> 05:33.660
Making their little pigeon noises...

05:33.680 --> 05:35.510
Crapping all over the window.

05:36.200 --> 05:39.870
- Could you give me a hand here? - Um, okay.

05:40.450 --> 05:41.490
See, the thing is,

05:41.510 --> 05:43.300
They're starting to work on the fall issue,

05:43.330 --> 05:45.870
- And Daniel's just a little concerned... - You want a beer?

05:45.890 --> 05:47.280
No, thank you.

05:47.330 --> 05:49.860
Uh, maybe... maybe after work,

05:49.890 --> 05:52.200
When it's appropriate to drink.

05:52.530 --> 05:53.970
So about the article--

05:54.000 --> 05:56.470
Listen, buzzkill, you can't rush art, okay?

05:56.490 --> 05:58.690
Did anyone say to Picasso, "yo, Pablo,

05:58.710 --> 05:59.650
"uh, could you hurry up

05:59.660 --> 06:00.970
"with that Guernica thing?

06:10.330 --> 06:12.740
You're a real Pioneers full of fun. shoo!

06:12.750 --> 06:14.760
Shoo! shoo! shoo!

06:14.790 --> 06:16.790
Come on. go. shoo. shoo.

06:18.000 --> 06:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here

06:25.550 --> 06:27.510
Why are they wearing gas masks?

06:27.550 --> 06:28.790
It's protecting them

06:28.800 --> 06:30.970
From the foul stench of their lies.

06:31.340 --> 06:34.510
Wow. uh... that's neat.

06:34.540 --> 06:35.890
It's dark, but neat.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.650
It's where inspiration took me.

06:37.750 --> 06:39.870
Um, matt, I have something

06:39.910 --> 06:42.790
That I've been meaning to talk to you about.

06:42.820 --> 06:44.630
I'm glad to hear it.

06:51.990 --> 06:53.670
God, this is hard.

06:56.910 --> 07:00.110
But before we move in, i-i think that you should know--

07:02.660 --> 07:05.480
Oh, my god! penny?

07:06.230 --> 07:08.220
Fall fashion exclusive--

07:08.240 --> 07:10.180
Emphasis on "fall."

07:10.220 --> 07:11.860
"mode" feature editor penny meadows

07:14.450 --> 07:18.310
To shoo pigeons away from her 28th-floor window.

07:18.350 --> 07:22.270
On my sexy death meter, this one barely rates a 3.

07:22.330 --> 07:25.240
All right, so I issued a statement to the press,

07:25.260 --> 07:26.600
Signed the police report.

07:26.630 --> 07:29.560
- What else are we forgetting? - I sent flowers to the family.

07:29.590 --> 07:31.390
- Oh, good. thank you. - daniel, I was thinking,

07:31.420 --> 07:33.680
Maybe I could organize a memorial service

07:33.720 --> 07:35.630
So that her friends here can say good-bye to her.

07:35.650 --> 07:39.480
-did she have friends -not really, but we'd do sth nice

07:39.510 --> 07:42.520
- I was thinking a coffee cart. - oh, I'd love a coffee--

07:42.570 --> 07:47.410
I mean, uh, I think penny would've really liked that.

07:47.780 --> 07:49.380
I hate even thinking about it,

07:49.410 --> 07:51.770
But how are we gonna spread out her workload here?

07:51.950 --> 07:54.610
Well, um...

07:54.940 --> 07:57.340
Daniel, since you brought it up,

07:57.360 --> 08:00.460
- I was thinking--  - do you want her job?

08:00.490 --> 08:03.310
Oh, god. it sounds so awful when you say it out loud.

08:03.330 --> 08:05.120
No, no, we were thinking the same thing.

08:05.150 --> 08:06.640
I think a feature editor position

08:06.650 --> 08:09.100
Would be a perfect fit for you.

08:11.150 --> 08:13.160
Well, we should be respectful.

08:13.510 --> 08:15.090
You know, let the grieving process happen

08:15.120 --> 08:17.390
Before we tell anyone.

08:17.410 --> 08:19.330
Way to go, aunt betty!

08:19.350 --> 08:22.200
Guys, please. it's a really delicate situation.

08:22.220 --> 08:24.190
Promise me you're not gonna show up at work

08:24.210 --> 08:25.610
With balloons or a cake.

08:25.640 --> 08:29.500
- Somebody say cake? - papi, please. it's so inappropriate.

08:29.540 --> 08:31.200
I'm sorry for how you got the job, mija,

08:31.230 --> 08:33.409
- But you know you deserve it. - thank you, papi.

08:33.440 --> 08:35.190
Look, if it helps, we can all go to church tonight

08:35.210 --> 08:37.390
- And light a candle for the poor woman. - oh, good.

08:37.419 --> 08:39.809
I could light a candle for saint vitus.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.429
The patron saint of all actors?

08:42.750 --> 08:45.650
He's gotta have some pull at the performing arts school.

08:45.680 --> 08:46.590
oh, honey. Don't worry about it.

08:46.610 --> 08:49.160
You're gonna get in. you're gonna be a big star.

08:49.170 --> 08:50.740
Now go help grandpa with the meat loaf.

08:50.770 --> 08:52.070
Hurry up. hurry up.

08:52.100 --> 08:54.340
so tell me, what happened with matt?

08:54.340 --> 08:56.740
I didn't get to tell him.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.720
The accident sort of interrupted things.

08:58.760 --> 09:02.900
- Good. - no, not good. I need to tell him.

09:02.930 --> 09:06.360
You know that I am a very spiritual person, right?

09:06.380 --> 09:08.320
- Not really. - I am.

09:08.330 --> 09:10.210
And I try to find the meaning in everything,

09:10.230 --> 09:13.280
And all I'm gonna say is, that woman gave her life

09:13.310 --> 09:14.910
So that you could have a chance at a new one.

09:14.910 --> 09:16.510
okay, that's a little much.

09:16.540 --> 09:18.520
You got a new job, you got a chance

09:18.540 --> 09:19.880
At a clean slate with matt.

09:19.890 --> 09:22.210
Why are you gonna screw it up by telling him?

09:22.230 --> 09:24.120
You're just gonna hurt him.

09:30.790 --> 09:31.880
Okay, ryan,

09:31.900 --> 09:33.780
If you're going to be replacing marc,

09:33.800 --> 09:35.200
There are a few things you need to know.

09:35.210 --> 09:38.020
NO.1, wilhelmina doesn't like being called by her name.

09:38.030 --> 09:39.790
She prefers "honey."

09:39.810 --> 09:42.800
And number "b," she insists on a morning mouth kiss--

09:42.820 --> 09:44.790
- A big one. - amanda!

09:44.810 --> 09:49.840
- Are you trying to sabotage young ryan? - yes, I hate him.

09:49.850 --> 09:51.500
Marc, you can't just replace yourself

09:51.520 --> 09:53.510
- With another gay guy. - I'm not gay.

09:53.520 --> 09:54.940
Yeah, right.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.330
You're in a long-distance relationship

09:56.350 --> 09:57.860
With a lovely heavy woman.

09:57.880 --> 10:00.000
Watch your back, new boy.

10:03.640 --> 10:05.090
She's coming out of her meeting.

10:05.110 --> 10:07.650
Give this file to her.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.330
Wilhelmina...

10:16.350 --> 10:19.000
We need to talk.

10:19.940 --> 10:22.650
So victoria hartley told you about south dakota.

10:22.680 --> 10:25.860
She told me her husband got you pregnant.

10:25.900 --> 10:28.050
I assume that's the same story.

10:28.080 --> 10:31.730
I was pregnant by my husband's best friend.

10:31.770 --> 10:34.590
I had a very difficult decision to make.

10:34.630 --> 10:36.770
I left the city and i...

10:36.820 --> 10:39.080
Terminated the pregnancy.

10:39.090 --> 10:40.730
Bradford and cal never knew.

10:40.750 --> 10:44.380
But all the lying drove me to have a nervous breakdown.

10:44.430 --> 10:47.770
It took me a year to recover.

10:47.810 --> 10:49.660
Mm. I love our girl talk.

10:49.690 --> 10:53.100
So I suspect there's a reason why you don't want cal

10:53.120 --> 10:56.510
To know about your difficult decision.

10:56.550 --> 10:59.460
I could see how he might hate you.

10:59.480 --> 11:01.630
What do you want, wilhelmina?

11:01.650 --> 11:04.610
I want you to step down

11:04.630 --> 11:07.320
As senior vice president of meade,

11:07.340 --> 11:09.190
And keep your big dandelion head

11:09.200 --> 11:12.320
Out of any "mode" business.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.240
Oh, claire, you know what might be fun?

11:17.280 --> 11:20.830
If you announce your resignation at the mama awards.

11:20.860 --> 11:23.360
Seems appropriate.

11:24.150 --> 11:25.860
Don't you think?

11:25.910 --> 11:28.300
I didn't think it was possible

11:28.320 --> 11:30.710
For a human being to exist

11:30.750 --> 11:34.430
And not have one ounce of humanity,

11:34.860 --> 11:37.630
But there you are.

11:37.690 --> 11:40.510
Why, claire, you flatter me.

11:47.490 --> 11:51.480
Methinks ye olde claire is vanquished

11:51.480 --> 11:54.260
yes, we have conquered our enemy once again.

11:54.300 --> 11:55.220
It seems like

11:55.260 --> 11:58.360
This will be our last conquest together.

11:58.620 --> 11:59.930
I guess it is.

11:59.950 --> 12:01.730
We've had a lot of good times together. oh.

12:01.750 --> 12:04.680
Remember breaking into that safe

12:04.700 --> 12:07.510
To steal bradford's will?

12:08.460 --> 12:10.040
Oh, that was the best.

12:10.050 --> 12:12.120
No. the best was having christina accused

12:12.140 --> 12:14.820
Of kidnapping her own baby.

12:14.840 --> 12:16.230
Wait, you're forgetting the fact

12:16.260 --> 12:19.220
The we stole the sperm from bradford's cold, dead body

12:19.230 --> 12:20.490
In the first place.

12:21.270 --> 12:22.520
Oh, good times.

12:23.810 --> 12:26.490
Oh. we really should be in jail.

12:26.500 --> 12:29.120
Marc, I know I always haven't been...

12:29.140 --> 12:31.400
Forthcoming with my praise for you.

12:31.420 --> 12:34.140
I just want you to know that, uh...

12:34.430 --> 12:36.650
I'm really...

12:36.710 --> 12:39.080
Going to miss you.

12:41.320 --> 12:43.940
Oh, my g--oh!

12:48.840 --> 12:50.580
Um, wilhelmina.

12:52.840 --> 12:53.940
I-i just wanted you to know

12:53.950 --> 12:56.690
That penny's memorial's about to start.

12:57.180 --> 12:59.800
Oh, uh, marc, before you go,

12:59.840 --> 13:02.840
I want to talk to you about something.

13:08.170 --> 13:09.480
So is that really the best picture

13:09.500 --> 13:10.590
You could find?

13:10.610 --> 13:12.610
It's the one where she was happiest.

13:13.140 --> 13:16.180
Oh--matt. hello.

13:16.190 --> 13:17.380
Hey, how's it going?

13:17.390 --> 13:18.940
Uh, pretty crazy.

13:18.950 --> 13:20.030
Yeah, I'll bet.

13:20.040 --> 13:21.960
Hey, listen, I know you're busy,

13:21.980 --> 13:23.220
But before everything happened,

13:23.230 --> 13:24.980
You were gonna tell me something.

13:25.410 --> 13:29.040
No, no. it was nothing.

13:29.060 --> 13:31.880
Really? 'cause it sounded pretty important.

13:32.310 --> 13:34.300
No, it was about the move.

13:34.300 --> 13:35.970
Um, listen, matt, uh,

13:35.990 --> 13:37.630
The memorial is just about to start.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.450
So could we talk about this later?

13:39.460 --> 13:40.690
Sure.

13:45.320 --> 13:46.910
Oh, my god. a ghost.

13:46.930 --> 13:51.230
I'm not a ghost, dumbass. I'm her twin sister.

13:51.260 --> 13:54.270
Oh. oh, I am so, so sorry about your sister.

13:54.280 --> 13:56.760
We all...

13:56.760 --> 13:59.390
Worked with her.

13:59.830 --> 14:01.420
You must be Mindy.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.740
Wow. you really do look-- I know.

14:03.760 --> 14:07.110
Penny got the looks, and I got the personality.

14:07.120 --> 14:10.370
Well, we're so glad you could make it.

14:10.380 --> 14:12.320
We were just happy to have an opportunity

14:12.330 --> 14:13.956
To pay tribute to your sister.

14:13.956 --> 14:16.999
Ok  lets get this doll and tony show on the road

14:16.999 --> 14:19.830
- I have a 4:00 eyelash tint.  - who had the latte?

14:19.840 --> 14:21.680
Oh, thank god. coffee.

14:25.130 --> 14:26.880
Hello. hi.

14:26.920 --> 14:29.680
Everybody, thank you so much for coming. um...

14:31.680 --> 14:34.250
God, there's so much to say about Penny Meadows.

14:34.250 --> 14:37.150
She was part of the "mode" family.

14:38.080 --> 14:40.370
Excuse me. sorry. Could we maybe not

14:40.390 --> 14:42.540
make blended drinks while people are talking?

14:42.770 --> 14:44.520
Thank you.

14:44.760 --> 14:47.530
Uh, so even though we all didn't know her...

14:47.550 --> 14:50.470
The--the way we wanted to know her...

14:50.480 --> 14:52.710
We'll miss her.

14:52.730 --> 14:55.650
Is there anyone else who'd like to share their thoughts?

14:55.660 --> 14:57.570
I have something I'd like to say.

14:59.490 --> 15:00.470
Good.

15:03.910 --> 15:06.280
I'm saddened, as everyone is,

15:06.290 --> 15:09.000
By the sudden death of Penny Meadows.

15:09.010 --> 15:12.300
The only way to make... sense of this tragedy

15:12.300 --> 15:14.930
Is to ensure that her legacy lives on.

15:15.210 --> 15:16.450
That will be my goal

15:16.460 --> 15:21.060
As the newest feature editor at "mode" magazine.

15:21.080 --> 15:23.300
What?! no way. that's my job.

15:23.301 --> 15:25.160
- this news you lose Betty  - I did this news

15:25.160 --> 15:27.080
I went after her job the second she died. oh.

15:27.090 --> 15:29.830
Is this still about my sister?!

15:39.170 --> 15:41.120
You can stare all you want, Marc.

15:41.140 --> 15:44.160
I'm not giving in. Daniel gave me this promotion.

15:44.170 --> 15:46.560
And wilhelmina gave me the promotion.

15:46.580 --> 15:48.500
Yeah. aren't you going to "vogue"?

15:48.510 --> 15:50.650
I passed when Willie reminded me

15:50.660 --> 15:52.210
How much I was needed at "mode,"

15:52.220 --> 15:54.950
Which everyone here agrees with. yeah.

15:54.960 --> 15:56.850
How could you be on his side?

15:56.870 --> 15:59.900
Amanda, I took you in when you had nowhere to live.

15:59.910 --> 16:02.250
That's because you wanted me for your ponzi scheme.

16:02.260 --> 16:03.870
You mean the Ponzi Scheme where I paid your rent

16:03.900 --> 16:07.480
- you went out shopping? - Yeah, I want my money back.

16:08.190 --> 16:09.250
Scram.

16:11.020 --> 16:12.450
It seems that the only thing that we can agree on

16:12.450 --> 16:14.580
Is that you're both qualified for the job.

16:14.600 --> 16:18.050
Unfortunately, there's only one position as editor.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.000
So here's what we're gonna do--

16:20.010 --> 16:21.990
We're making copies of Penny's hard drive--

16:22.000 --> 16:24.520
All her research on the Yves Saint Laurent article.

16:24.530 --> 16:27.510
you'll take what she's done and prepare it for publication.

16:27.520 --> 16:30.010
Whoever does best gets the job.

16:30.020 --> 16:31.790
The loser gets fired.

16:31.800 --> 16:35.030
- The loser stays an assistant. - not as interesting, but ok.

16:35.030 --> 16:36.510
Any questions?

16:36.520 --> 16:37.990
No.

16:42.980 --> 16:44.230
I guess we're on.

16:44.250 --> 16:45.900
We certainly are.

16:55.670 --> 16:56.950
It's from Laguardia.

16:56.970 --> 17:00.230
- The airport? - The school of the performing arts.

17:00.260 --> 17:01.770
I can't open it.

17:01.790 --> 17:03.830
I can't.

17:08.020 --> 17:10.380
"thank you for your application."

17:11.450 --> 17:13.089
"unfortunately, we're unable to accommodate you

17:13.109 --> 17:15.430
For the upcoming school year."

17:16.130 --> 17:17.510
What?

17:17.520 --> 17:18.800
Sorry, mijo.

17:18.810 --> 17:20.800
- They're idiots! - Hey, the good news is, it says

17:20.810 --> 17:22.460
You can try out again next year.

17:22.460 --> 17:24.109
I don't want to go next year.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.940
Yeah, I know, Justin, but look at this way--

17:25.960 --> 17:26.869
You know how many times

17:26.890 --> 17:28.580
I ran for city council before I won?

17:28.610 --> 17:33.580
Things that are worth it, sometimes, they--they take time.

17:35.060 --> 17:37.470
I... I-I just wanted to go now.

17:43.250 --> 17:44.310
You're gonna win this.

17:44.320 --> 17:45.720
I wouldn't have agreed to it if you weren't.

17:45.730 --> 17:47.330
There isn't a chance in hell

17:47.350 --> 17:49.315
Marc is gonna turn in a piece better than yours.

17:49.315 --> 17:51.280
I hope so.

18:01.250 --> 18:02.960
Is that your family?

18:02.970 --> 18:04.890
No, Amanda, they're birds.

18:04.900 --> 18:07.930
And apparently the only thing on Penny's hard drive.

18:07.940 --> 18:09.380
Where are her notes?

18:09.390 --> 18:10.670
Well, they wouldn't be on there.

18:10.680 --> 18:12.100
Penny always worked from home.

18:12.120 --> 18:13.690
She only ever came in if she needed

18:13.700 --> 18:16.010
Those ugly yellow pads from the supply closet

18:16.020 --> 18:19.010
Or to take a quick whore's bath in the ladies room.

18:19.020 --> 18:20.700
Thank you, Amanda.

18:24.350 --> 18:26.310
Do you want to get some lunch?

18:28.610 --> 18:30.160
So I think most of penny's research

18:30.180 --> 18:31.330
Is in her apartment.

18:31.350 --> 18:33.530
I was going to go by, see if I can get in.

18:33.830 --> 18:35.660
Well, it sounds like you have a good handle on things.

18:35.680 --> 18:39.100
So did, uh, Henry and his girlfriend get off okay?

18:39.110 --> 18:41.370
I think so.

18:42.680 --> 18:45.460
You, uh, see him again before he left?

18:47.460 --> 18:51.630
I did, briefly, but it wasn't a big deal.

18:53.100 --> 18:54.960
Really? it seemed like a big deal.

18:55.700 --> 18:57.760
I saw you. you kissed him.

18:58.560 --> 19:00.570
Right here in this park, you kissed him,

19:00.580 --> 19:02.310
And I have given you every opportunity

19:02.330 --> 19:04.440
To tell me the truth, but you didn't.

19:04.470 --> 19:06.260
You've just been lying to me.

19:06.270 --> 19:08.860
- I haven't been lying to you, Matt. - maybe not directly.

19:08.880 --> 19:10.030
It's not like I said,

19:10.040 --> 19:11.690
"hey, Betty, I know you're my girlfriend,

19:11.710 --> 19:13.750
I just want to know, have you kissed anyone this week?"

19:13.770 --> 19:16.605
'cause that's not usually a question boyfriends have to ask.

19:16.605 --> 19:18.250
It didn't mean anything. I swear.

19:18.260 --> 19:21.550
- I-I was just saying good-bye to him. - I don't believe you.

19:21.560 --> 19:24.350
Matt, please. Can we just talk about this?

19:24.370 --> 19:26.310
That is what I've wanted to do ever since I stood there

19:26.310 --> 19:29.000
With my heart in my socks watching you kiss him.

19:29.020 --> 19:31.040
Look, don't you know how I feel about you?

19:31.070 --> 19:33.600
don't you know that I'd never kiss someone else, ever?

19:33.600 --> 19:37.360
I'm sorry. It just happened. it means nothing.

19:37.380 --> 19:39.150
- You have to trust me. - How?

19:39.170 --> 19:41.420
I opened up to you, I wanted us to move in together,

19:41.450 --> 19:43.280
And this is what you do to me? I...

19:46.250 --> 19:48.030
Matt.

19:58.950 --> 20:01.940
Hilda, I lied to him, and you told me to.

20:01.960 --> 20:03.780
But you were protecting his feelings.

20:03.790 --> 20:05.900
Yeah, that distinction was kind of lost on him.

20:05.910 --> 20:07.760
A year ago, everything was so clear.

20:07.770 --> 20:10.850
I wanted my own place in the city. I wanted a promotion.

20:10.860 --> 20:13.040
The last thing I wanted was a boyfriend.

20:13.050 --> 20:15.640
And now it's all I can think about.

20:15.650 --> 20:17.200
Okay, you gotta listen to me.

20:17.210 --> 20:20.020
Matt needs time to cool off, and you cannot screw up

20:20.030 --> 20:22.515
Something that you've been working for the past few years

20:22.515 --> 20:24.580
how am I supposed to think about work right now?

20:24.700 --> 20:26.810
Mama, you have to.

20:32.310 --> 20:33.580
Focus.

20:33.740 --> 20:35.360
No, listen to me, you tell Dave

20:35.370 --> 20:37.370
I want those prints on my desk by this afternoon,

20:37.380 --> 20:39.100
Or we're taking our business someplace else.

20:39.100 --> 20:41.320
It's not negotiable.

20:43.800 --> 20:46.390
You're sexy when you get all bossy boots.

20:49.770 --> 20:50.720
What?

20:50.750 --> 20:52.280
You have been working so hard

20:52.300 --> 20:54.450
Taking care of "mode" and me.

20:54.470 --> 20:56.570
I thought a romantic meal might force you

20:56.590 --> 20:58.770
To take time out to enjoy yourself.

20:58.790 --> 21:01.490
Plus, I need your opinion on my dress

21:01.510 --> 21:03.060
For the mama awards.

21:03.070 --> 21:04.810
What do you think?

21:04.830 --> 21:08.530
I think lunch... is gonna have to wait.

21:08.550 --> 21:09.850
But it'll get cold.

21:09.880 --> 21:12.190
I don't care. it's not negotiable.

21:18.720 --> 21:21.040
You're here?

21:21.060 --> 21:23.190
No, you're here.

21:23.200 --> 21:24.420
I call the apartment!

21:24.430 --> 21:26.800
No, no. you can't call the apartment.

21:26.820 --> 21:29.890
We're both entitled to the same information.

21:30.660 --> 21:33.200
Great. making up rules as we go along.

21:33.220 --> 21:35.140
Well, we're both here. we need the research.

21:35.170 --> 21:36.270
What have you found?

21:36.290 --> 21:40.600
Nothing. just boxes and boxes of menthol cigarettes,

21:40.610 --> 21:42.270
Vintage porn,

21:42.280 --> 21:44.770
More menthol cigarettes.

21:45.170 --> 21:47.660
We are never gonna find anything in here.

21:47.720 --> 21:51.200
Nothing except for more of these female jock straps.

21:51.220 --> 21:52.620
- Bras, Marc.  - Whatever.

21:52.630 --> 21:54.370
I allowed myself to get beat up all through high school

21:54.390 --> 21:57.150
So I wouldn't have to handle things like this.

21:57.370 --> 22:00.280
God, she really did like beef jerky, didn't she?

22:00.290 --> 22:03.810
Oh! that's the other smell on her breath.

22:03.830 --> 22:05.810
What are you two dinks doing here?

22:05.830 --> 22:07.120
Mindy, hi.

22:07.130 --> 22:08.860
How are you?

22:08.890 --> 22:10.385
I just had a pap smear,

22:10.386 --> 22:11.880
I stepped in poo on the subway,

22:11.900 --> 22:14.520
And my sister's dead. how do you think I am?

22:14.540 --> 22:16.570
In need of a hug.

22:16.590 --> 22:19.230
Betty, hug her.

22:19.250 --> 22:20.970
Whoa, whoa, whoa. back off.

22:20.980 --> 22:24.040
Got a real lezzie vibe off you the minute I met ya.

22:24.060 --> 22:26.520
What? it wasn't enough to ruin my sister's memorial?

22:26.540 --> 22:28.890
You have to come in here and wreck her apartment, too?

22:28.900 --> 22:31.080
Mindy, we're just looking for anything

22:31.090 --> 22:32.880
On your sister's Yves Saint Laurent piece.

22:32.890 --> 22:36.380
And we want to put it together and publish it in "mode."

22:36.390 --> 22:37.920
For Penny.

22:37.930 --> 22:40.970
Our penny.

22:51.670 --> 22:54.230
Is this what you're looking for?

22:55.090 --> 22:56.050
maybe.

22:56.070 --> 22:57.750
Amanda said yellow.

22:57.760 --> 23:00.360
- No, no, no. what are you doing?  - no!

23:03.150 --> 23:04.490
Penny hated "mode."

23:04.500 --> 23:06.350
Now get out!

23:09.140 --> 23:10.180
To Penny...

23:10.220 --> 23:13.610
Hater of pigeons, lover of vintage porn.

23:19.700 --> 23:22.540
Today really has been the worst day.

23:22.560 --> 23:25.580
Ugh. Matt hates me, this assignment is a dead end,

23:25.590 --> 23:28.110
And I am so mad at daniel.

23:28.120 --> 23:31.110
I know. he is such an idiot.

23:31.120 --> 23:33.060
What the hell is wrong with Wilhelmina?

23:33.080 --> 23:36.110
I know. daniel is such an idiot.

23:36.120 --> 23:37.800
it's not like you haven't already given her

23:37.810 --> 23:39.460
Your blood, sweat and tears.

23:39.470 --> 23:43.040
I have practically cut arteries open for that woman.

23:43.050 --> 23:46.510
You know who I think the real idiots are?  The two of you.

23:46.520 --> 23:47.920
You're a mean drunk.

23:47.930 --> 23:50.260
Seriously. you are such whiners.

23:50.270 --> 23:52.810
Not to mention, you are totally letting me down.

23:52.820 --> 23:54.730
If one of you freak shows doesn't pull ahead,

23:54.740 --> 23:57.210
Then who am I supposed to glom on to?

23:57.220 --> 24:00.860
And yes, I bring the pretty and the sparkly...

24:00.900 --> 24:04.240
But shockingly, sometimes that's not enough.

24:04.260 --> 24:05.940
And, you know, Marc, with your brains,

24:05.950 --> 24:07.590
And, betty, with your aztec build,

24:07.620 --> 24:10.080
There is nothing the two of you can't do.

24:10.110 --> 24:11.940
So what are we supposed to do?

24:11.950 --> 24:14.420
I don't know. I'm so drunk...

24:14.440 --> 24:17.770
My jockstrap is starting to dig in.

24:17.860 --> 24:20.690
I'll be right back.

24:22.500 --> 24:23.810
She's right.

24:23.830 --> 24:26.610
About what? I didn't follow any of that.

24:26.630 --> 24:29.090
Marc, we can do anything.

24:29.690 --> 24:32.170
We just have to join forces.

24:32.340 --> 24:34.500
What are you thinking?

24:38.430 --> 24:40.170
What is this?

24:42.320 --> 24:44.880
Our letters of resignation.

24:46.280 --> 24:47.420
Resigning?

24:47.440 --> 24:48.620
What about the article?

24:48.640 --> 24:51.540
- It flew out the window.  - like penny herself.

24:51.570 --> 24:53.930
Look, we are both worthy of this position.

24:53.940 --> 24:56.530
So we're doing what any good editor should do

24:56.540 --> 24:58.870
Presenting you with strong options.

24:58.890 --> 25:01.080
- It's either marc  - or betty.

25:01.090 --> 25:02.970
Unless you want both of our resignations,

25:02.990 --> 25:05.550
You have to decide who gets promoted to editor

25:05.560 --> 25:07.520
Of a fashion magazine.

25:07.530 --> 25:08.980
A features editor.

25:08.990 --> 25:10.400
Of a fashion magazine.

25:10.410 --> 25:13.290
- Enough.  - Give us some time to discuss.

25:13.300 --> 25:15.230
You are dismissed.

25:21.490 --> 25:23.430
That was terrifying. did I seem terrified?

25:23.470 --> 25:24.600
I was terrified.

25:24.620 --> 25:26.650
I'm still shaking. it was good, though.

25:26.670 --> 25:28.010
I feel strangely empowered.

25:28.020 --> 25:28.930
Where are you going?

25:28.940 --> 25:31.110
To see Matt. wish me luck.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.160
Hi.

25:39.180 --> 25:41.550
- Can we talk? - I don't know if I'm ready.

25:41.560 --> 25:43.220
Matt, please just listen to me.

25:43.230 --> 25:45.000
I made a mistake,

25:45.020 --> 25:47.480
And I should've just told you what happened, but I didn't,

25:47.490 --> 25:50.250
And I'm sorry, and if I could go back and change it,

25:50.270 --> 25:52.150
I would, but I can't.

25:52.160 --> 25:55.020
All I can tell you is that I love you

25:55.050 --> 25:57.770
And I want to be with you.

25:58.900 --> 26:01.470
I don't think we should just throw this all away.

26:04.180 --> 26:06.170
I have to get to class.

26:07.850 --> 26:10.300
Here's a ticket to the mama awards.

26:13.300 --> 26:15.080
I hope you'll come.

26:28.160 --> 26:30.840
Oh, no. I forgot. have you seen my note cards?

26:30.860 --> 26:31.820
Don't tell me

26:31.840 --> 26:34.040
You're one of those guys who goes up there all modest,

26:34.060 --> 26:35.280
Then has a prepared speech,

26:35.300 --> 26:38.800
- like you knew you were gonna win.  - look, you were right.

26:38.810 --> 26:39.960
It's a big deal.

26:39.980 --> 26:41.330
I mean, think about it. what if we win?

26:41.340 --> 26:43.880
I don't want to look like a deer in the headlights.

26:46.490 --> 26:48.740
I'm glad it's important to you.

26:53.630 --> 26:55.940
You're warm.

26:56.750 --> 26:58.070
Your fever's back. Molly

26:58.100 --> 27:00.280
I'm fine. I'm just a little tired.

27:00.300 --> 27:01.490
No, we're both staying home.

27:01.500 --> 27:02.500
I'm gonna go cancel the limo right now.

27:03.280 --> 27:05.060
honey, this is your night.

27:05.420 --> 27:07.290
And I will not be the reason you miss it.

27:07.310 --> 27:09.210
-But it's more - I'll make you a deal.

27:09.220 --> 27:11.680
Your award's later in the presentation, right?

27:11.700 --> 27:15.000
- Yeah. - So you go, I'll take a nap,

27:15.020 --> 27:17.840
And then I'll meet you there in time for your category.

27:20.470 --> 27:23.180
Save me a seat.

27:25.590 --> 27:27.620
Okay.

27:28.250 --> 27:31.350
But I'm having the nurse come by to check on you.

27:48.930 --> 27:50.240
Suzuki st. pierre reporting

27:50.250 --> 27:52.160
From the mother of all publishing award shows...

27:52.170 --> 27:53.600
The mamas.

27:53.610 --> 27:55.770
Tensions are high and faces are pulled

27:55.780 --> 27:58.430
As we wonder who will go home with a mama

27:58.440 --> 28:00.570
And who will go home to feel self-worth

28:00.570 --> 28:03.540
With booze, pills, internet sex and trans fats.

28:03.560 --> 28:05.800
Or as I call it, thursdays.

28:08.190 --> 28:10.510
Looking forward to your big announcement.

28:14.480 --> 28:15.770
Oh, look.

28:15.790 --> 28:17.760
Somebody's been picking through liz hurley's old rags

28:19.260 --> 28:20.340
Oh, my god.

28:20.360 --> 28:22.410
He just said I look exactly like liz hurley.

28:22.420 --> 28:24.050
Yeah, go with that.

28:24.580 --> 28:26.820
And there's evelia avila.

28:28.290 --> 28:30.540
I'm sorry. oh, my god!

28:30.550 --> 28:32.530
Antonio sabato jr.

28:32.550 --> 28:33.780
Aunt betty, didn't you have

28:33.810 --> 28:35.100
A dream with him the other night?

28:35.110 --> 28:37.250
-J...uh, justin. -what was that dream?

28:37.260 --> 28:39.180
it was nothing.

28:39.200 --> 28:41.370
Aunt betty, tell him about the hot dog.

28:41.390 --> 28:43.110
god, it's good to meet you.

28:43.120 --> 28:46.990
Stop. that was fun.

28:47.170 --> 28:48.680
Did it cheer you up?

28:48.690 --> 28:51.200
Yeah. I mean, I'll never have a career like his

28:51.210 --> 28:53.730
Because I didn't get into the performing arts school,

28:53.750 --> 28:56.850
-But I could always be a plumber. -justin.

28:56.870 --> 28:59.060
Aunt betty, I'm fine.

28:59.080 --> 29:01.990
- I'm just happy you brought me here. - betty!

29:02.250 --> 29:04.240
Hey, you, betty's son, come with me to the swag room.

29:04.250 --> 29:06.530
- I want to get two bags. - okay.

29:12.160 --> 29:14.670
I didn't know you were coming tonight, matt.

29:14.740 --> 29:17.890
I wasn't. I came to see betty.

29:18.140 --> 29:20.580
Everything all right, son?

29:23.160 --> 29:24.750
I don't know how I didn't get in.

29:24.760 --> 29:27.190
I mean, how do you beat a monologue from "equus"

29:27.200 --> 29:29.090
And 16 bars from "les mis"?

29:29.100 --> 29:31.410
You're great, kid. they made a mistake.

29:31.410 --> 29:34.410
Well, like everyone says, there's always next year.

29:34.420 --> 29:36.880
- But the problem is this year, right? - yeah.

29:36.880 --> 29:39.840
You're about to start public high school in queens

29:39.840 --> 29:42.960
And you're afraid that it's going to suck, right?

29:42.970 --> 29:45.300
Pretty much.

29:45.300 --> 29:47.560
It might.

29:48.640 --> 29:50.020
It's just...

29:50.050 --> 29:52.730
I don't always fit in with new people.

29:52.740 --> 29:56.620
And I thought that laguardia would have more people...

29:56.630 --> 29:59.030
You know, that...

29:59.290 --> 30:01.790
Like the same things that I like.

30:02.830 --> 30:04.400
Right.

30:05.040 --> 30:07.580
Well... this may shock you,

30:07.590 --> 30:09.680
But yours truly

30:09.690 --> 30:13.030
Is a product of a public high school,

30:13.040 --> 30:15.090
And I think I'm pretty great.

30:15.710 --> 30:18.770
The trick, I think, is to find your niche.

30:18.780 --> 30:21.150
And if you can't find one...

30:23.920 --> 30:25.740
Make one.

30:31.270 --> 30:33.210
Maybe I have been too hard on her, dad.

30:33.210 --> 30:34.610
I mean, she was kissing him good-bye.

30:34.620 --> 30:36.250
I should be able to let that go, right?

30:40.100 --> 30:41.670
What?

30:41.690 --> 30:44.300
Did I ever tell you about my first motorcycle?

30:51.790 --> 30:54.520
- Okay. - and I've had a lot of cycles since then,

30:54.540 --> 30:58.140
But I never loved any of 'em like I loved that old girl.

30:58.570 --> 30:59.930
I get it.

30:59.940 --> 31:02.890
I'm fancier, but henry runs like stink.

31:02.900 --> 31:04.010
All I'm saying is,

31:04.020 --> 31:08.770
You will always be competing with that first motorcycle,

31:09.060 --> 31:11.140
Especially if it's shoving its tongue

31:11.160 --> 31:13.230
Down your girlfriend's throat.

31:14.850 --> 31:16.850
I don't know what to do.

31:16.860 --> 31:19.010
I know. I've been there.

31:19.020 --> 31:22.480
But... I let myself

31:22.480 --> 31:25.170
Just get good and mad

31:25.180 --> 31:27.550
And then I channeled that into work.

31:27.560 --> 31:30.400
It made me what I am today.

31:30.660 --> 31:32.910
I don't really have a job anymore.

31:32.920 --> 31:35.150
You could.

31:35.160 --> 31:37.640
Dvds?

31:37.650 --> 31:40.350
where are the hermes? where are the chanel watches?

31:40.360 --> 31:43.550
Dvds, seriously? they're not even on blu-ray?

31:43.560 --> 31:45.620
This should be a nice treat for you then.

31:45.630 --> 31:47.380
Daniel's acceptance speech.

31:47.390 --> 31:49.680
So he'll be tongue-tied, and you'll take over.

31:49.690 --> 31:52.560
See? I'm still your assistant for the moment. I do my job.

31:52.570 --> 31:53.890
Nice.

31:53.910 --> 31:55.250
Wilhelmina, we need to talk.

31:55.260 --> 31:57.090
Hey, "air buddies."

31:57.100 --> 31:59.910
- What is it, daniel? - well, we've been avoiding this all day.

31:59.920 --> 32:02.710
- We need to make a choice-- marc or betty? - okay. marc.

32:02.720 --> 32:06.930
- Wilhelmina, come on. - you're right.

32:06.940 --> 32:10.110
We are dealing with the fate of two people's lives.

32:10.130 --> 32:12.650
There's only one fair way to do it.

32:16.020 --> 32:17.590
You want to flip a coin?

32:17.600 --> 32:19.490
Look, they're both equally qualified,

32:19.500 --> 32:21.010
And neither of us are willing to budge.

32:21.020 --> 32:23.390
You have a better idea?

32:28.480 --> 32:30.900
Heads, it's marc. tails, betty.

32:50.390 --> 32:52.900
- I guess that's it.  - Yes, that's it

32:56.520 --> 33:00.450
And the nominees for photographer of the year are...

33:00.470 --> 33:03.880
Patrick demarchelier for "american vogue,"

33:04.830 --> 33:07.030
oh, it's happening.

33:07.040 --> 33:08.960
I hope it's not annie leibovitz.

33:08.970 --> 33:11.440
I mean, I love her, but I'm bored.

33:11.710 --> 33:14.020
Betty, can I talk to you?

33:14.040 --> 33:16.160
Yeah. I'll be right back.

33:16.170 --> 33:17.640
And the mama goes to...

33:17.660 --> 33:19.720
Annie leibovitz for "vanity fair."

33:23.240 --> 33:26.610
So about the job...

33:29.170 --> 33:32.120
Daniel, it's...It's fine.

33:32.130 --> 33:35.430
I know it was a hard decision and--

33:35.440 --> 33:37.150
It's yours.

33:37.160 --> 33:39.340
You're our newest features editor.

33:39.350 --> 33:41.130
What?! aah!

33:41.140 --> 33:43.050
Oh, my god! that's amazing!

33:43.050 --> 33:45.140
Thank you! thank you! thank you! aah!

33:45.140 --> 33:47.690
You scared the hell out of me.

33:47.700 --> 33:52.070
-I couldn't really help myself. -my god. this is wonderful.

33:52.070 --> 33:55.360
I'm just glad you're not going too far.

Oh, uh, sorry.

35:07.930 --> 35:10.160
Maybe I should, uh...

35:10.190 --> 35:13.720
This award means so much...

35:13.730 --> 35:16.650
So much to me personally.

35:16.740 --> 35:19.730
I mean, it's not just the end product

35:19.740 --> 35:21.570
Of a-a... a lot of hard work.

35:21.580 --> 35:25.040
It's, um... it's a symbol...

35:25.050 --> 35:27.570
A symbol of love.

35:27.630 --> 35:29.900
You know, sometimes...

35:29.930 --> 35:32.370
We're fated to meet certain people

35:32.390 --> 35:34.190
Who, uh, can change our lives,

35:34.210 --> 35:38.360
People who really make a difference.

35:38.750 --> 35:40.390
They make you a better person,

35:40.400 --> 35:42.250
They push you to grow.

35:42.270 --> 35:45.130
I'd just really like to share this award with everyone

35:45.130 --> 35:47.610
Who did this with me.

35:47.930 --> 35:49.640
Thank you.

36:23.390 --> 36:25.670
Thanks, betty. hey, where did molly go?

36:25.690 --> 36:27.380
I haven't seen her.

36:27.390 --> 36:28.900
She was right next to you.

36:28.910 --> 36:30.460
No, I don't think so.

36:30.460 --> 36:32.000
Betty, she was standing right next to you.

36:32.020 --> 36:36.750
Daniel, I didn't see her. are you okay?

36:39.840 --> 36:43.060
Yeah. um... I'm gonna go.

36:48.940 --> 36:51.800
Great speech, wilhelmina.

36:51.810 --> 36:52.980
Speaking of speeches,

36:52.990 --> 36:55.370
When are you announcing you're stepping down?

36:55.380 --> 36:57.300
I'm not going to step down.

36:57.300 --> 37:00.450
then I think it's time hartley knew about your choice

37:00.450 --> 37:02.470
Not to have his baby.

37:02.480 --> 37:06.800
I already know, and it's none of your business.

37:07.060 --> 37:09.160
Cal and I have been talking,

37:09.180 --> 37:10.340
And we decided

37:10.340 --> 37:14.350
We need to reevaluate your role in the company.

37:20.330 --> 37:21.640
I still don't believe it.

37:21.650 --> 37:24.430
Okay, we got the champagne and the cake ready.

37:24.450 --> 37:25.940
We're very proud of you, mi amor.

37:25.950 --> 37:27.280
Why aren't you home yet? yeah.

37:27.290 --> 37:30.550
There's just something I wanted to do first--

37:30.750 --> 37:33.360
Stop by my new office.

37:33.390 --> 37:36.510
You're getting everything you wanted.

37:36.980 --> 37:39.750
I am. I'll see you at home.

37:40.530 --> 37:43.380
Matt... I'm so glad you're here.

37:43.390 --> 37:44.740
I mean, can you believe...

37:44.740 --> 37:47.140
betty, wait. I have to ask you something.

37:47.150 --> 37:48.800
Okay.

37:48.880 --> 37:51.230
Do you still love him?

37:53.990 --> 37:56.200
So you do.

37:57.260 --> 38:00.540
Matt... look, henry was my first love.

38:00.550 --> 38:01.620
I guess there's always gonna be

38:01.640 --> 38:02.930
A part of me that does,

38:02.940 --> 38:05.670
But... but that's a part of my past.

38:07.480 --> 38:09.090
I mean...

38:09.120 --> 38:12.320
Don't you feel that way about your first love?

38:12.890 --> 38:15.930
The thing is, betty...

38:15.980 --> 38:18.530
You're my first love.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.830
You told me all I needed to hear.

38:23.860 --> 38:26.660
What are you saying?

38:27.450 --> 38:31.440
I'm saying... we're over.

38:37.610 --> 38:39.250
What--what, that's it? you're just gonna walk away?

38:39.270 --> 38:41.320
I'm never gonna see you again?

38:41.340 --> 38:45.190
No, you'll see me... every day.

38:46.290 --> 38:47.730
My dad offered me a job at "mode,"

38:47.760 --> 38:50.260
And I'm gonna take it.

38:52.100 --> 38:54.660
I'm your new boss.

39:08.870 --> 39:11.440
I have never felt more alone.

39:11.460 --> 39:15.110
It appears that my position at my own company

39:15.130 --> 39:17.260
Is being undermined.

39:17.280 --> 39:20.080
My company is all I have.

39:20.310 --> 39:22.410
How can I help?

39:22.430 --> 39:23.860
Well, the only way I can fix it

39:23.870 --> 39:27.590
Is to get enough money to push out cal hartley.

39:28.020 --> 39:31.480
And the only person I know with that kind of money...

39:31.870 --> 39:35.550
Is the man who stole it

39:39.640 --> 39:41.230
Connor owens.

39:41.240 --> 39:42.490
You want him alive?

39:42.500 --> 39:47.420
As long as I get the money, I really don't care.

40:06.870 --> 40:09.400
What are you doing here?

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
