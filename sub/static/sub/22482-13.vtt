WEBVTT

00:10.414 --> 00:12.164
Jill knows we're here, right?

00:13.257 --> 00:16.251
The invite said be
here at 8:00. That's it.

00:16.253 --> 00:18.420
Look, she's been gone for three months.

00:18.687 --> 00:20.472
I bet she wants to make an entrance.

00:20.474 --> 00:22.174
Of course she does. She expects applause

00:22.176 --> 00:23.914
when she comes back from the bathroom.

00:24.758 --> 00:27.750
Well, it's our fault
we started doing that.

00:29.390 --> 00:31.183
You think she lost all the weight?

00:31.185 --> 00:32.671
Weight? Come on.

00:32.695 --> 00:35.640
She didn't go to that place just
so she could kick her pie habit.

00:35.825 --> 00:38.804
My bet, she has new boobs
and a neck like a baby.

00:39.785 --> 00:42.242
She's already beautiful;
why would she do that?

00:42.580 --> 00:43.796
Well, money makes you crazy.

00:43.821 --> 00:45.812
That's why you and I are so normal.

00:50.366 --> 00:52.450
God, I hope that's not her walking.

00:57.684 --> 01:00.328
This is actually less
than I was expecting.

01:04.697 --> 01:07.022
She's back and she's skinny!

01:08.522 --> 01:10.555
Oh! Welcome home!

01:10.557 --> 01:12.562
You look amazing! Wow! I'm proud of you!

01:12.587 --> 01:13.656
Oh! Woo-hoo!

01:13.681 --> 01:15.181
We missed you so much.

01:15.464 --> 01:16.996
I missed you guys, too.

01:17.021 --> 01:19.322
Wow, no scarring. Good work.

01:19.789 --> 01:21.817
It's my same face, Bonnie.

01:21.819 --> 01:23.535
One of the things I
learned at the retreat

01:23.537 --> 01:25.523
is it's not about the outside,
it's about what's in here.

01:25.656 --> 01:28.406
Couldn't agree more. Botox and fillers.

01:30.289 --> 01:32.820
I am in a bliss balloon
not even you can pop.

01:32.845 --> 01:34.628
Mm, you do seem happy.

01:34.653 --> 01:37.132
I am. I am totally frickin' at peace.

01:37.625 --> 01:39.679
Now sit back down;
I've got 20 more outfits

01:39.704 --> 01:41.421
and a bikini I want to show you.

01:42.361 --> 01:45.195
Look, I can run again!

01:53.394 --> 01:57.874

02:02.350 --> 02:04.600
You guys sure you don't
want a bite of this pudding?

02:04.625 --> 02:06.885
Butterscotch, the only
scotch we can have.

02:07.523 --> 02:10.127
I'm fine with my lemon water.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.656
I'm so impressed you're
totally off sugar.

02:12.681 --> 02:15.838
- Me, too.
- You're my hero.

02:15.863 --> 02:17.539
Whenever you're ready.

02:23.426 --> 02:25.765
I guess we should pay.

02:28.014 --> 02:30.390
Yup. Got to get to the meeting.

02:30.415 --> 02:33.554
Yup. Before all the good seats are gone.

02:41.617 --> 02:43.661
Let's see what the damage is.

02:49.003 --> 02:50.967
That'll cover my part.

02:52.445 --> 02:54.088
Your part?

02:54.090 --> 02:55.476
Yeah, my share.

02:56.367 --> 02:57.722
Oh.

02:57.747 --> 02:59.914
It's just that traditionally
your share is...

03:00.714 --> 03:02.547
the whole thing.

03:02.937 --> 03:05.433
Well, in addition to eating healthy,

03:05.435 --> 03:08.219
the retreat also taught me that
I need to stop using my money

03:08.221 --> 03:11.189
to buy love; ergo, y'all need
to start paying for yourselves,

03:11.191 --> 03:12.835
'cause I ain't no Bank of America.

03:13.991 --> 03:18.039
Look, I'm a huge fan
of growth... go, you...

03:18.414 --> 03:19.814
But a little heads up

03:19.816 --> 03:22.125
would've helped me budget
my order accordingly.

03:22.402 --> 03:23.882
Jill, you're right.

03:23.907 --> 03:27.007
We're all perfectly capable
of paying for our own food.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.906
I'm sorry if you felt like
we were mooching off of you.

03:29.931 --> 03:33.046
- Which we were not.
- Here's your Reuben to go.

03:35.125 --> 03:37.351
I had every intention
of paying for this.

03:37.688 --> 03:40.609
I can feel you reaching into my purse.

03:48.011 --> 03:52.000
Let me guess, this new tax deal
doesn't make us millionaires.

03:52.734 --> 03:55.109
No, it's about the bistro.

03:55.318 --> 03:58.773
If we average $15 apiece every meal,

03:58.798 --> 04:00.882
that's $90 a week.

04:01.378 --> 04:04.262
That's $5,000 a year
Jill's been covering.

04:04.327 --> 04:05.757
You sure about that, Jethro?

04:05.782 --> 04:07.640
You never were much at cipherin'.

04:08.122 --> 04:09.515
Sure I'm sure.

04:09.540 --> 04:11.790
I used this here number box.

04:12.789 --> 04:14.285
It doesn't seem fair.

04:14.287 --> 04:17.327
Why does Jill's self-esteem
have to come out of our pockets?

04:17.461 --> 04:21.084
I know. We either have to
start buying our own lunch

04:21.108 --> 04:22.677
or make Jill hate herself again.

04:22.679 --> 04:25.920
Easy peasy. Just bring up her
ex-husband and their new baby

04:25.945 --> 04:28.132
and slide a Meat Lover's
pizza in front of her.

04:29.679 --> 04:31.552
We can't keep leeching off her.

04:31.554 --> 04:32.679
Hey, it's not like we were

04:32.704 --> 04:34.388
taking advantage of her on purpose.

04:34.390 --> 04:36.835
It's Tuesday! Where's my free Reuben?

04:39.671 --> 04:42.029
Well, this is an adventure.

04:42.031 --> 04:44.460
I haven't carried a tray
since I was in lockup.

04:44.796 --> 04:46.651
I love this concept.

04:46.653 --> 04:49.289
Food from around the world.
Where'd you find this place?

04:49.314 --> 04:52.039
Ah, the ultimate experts on cheap food:

04:52.064 --> 04:53.897
broke-ass college kids.

04:53.922 --> 04:57.554
I ordered a four, a six and
a nine at the Asian counter.

04:57.579 --> 05:00.329
I don't even know what
they are; I just panicked.

05:00.867 --> 05:03.000
Oh, my God, there you are.

05:03.002 --> 05:05.742
I got trapped in a sea of
hoodies at the salsa bar.

05:05.927 --> 05:09.261
Oh, you're gonna have to get
your own silverware and napkins.

05:09.812 --> 05:11.742
Oh, I work here now?

05:12.398 --> 05:15.851
Here, take my fork. I got chili.

05:18.561 --> 05:20.264
Mine's already done?

05:20.520 --> 05:24.257
Can a four, a six or a nine
be safely cooked that fast?

05:25.960 --> 05:28.192
Okay, Wendy's our
canary in the coal mine.

05:28.194 --> 05:31.140
If she pukes, gags or
keels over, we stop eating.

05:31.546 --> 05:33.129
Okay, it's not the bistro.

05:33.366 --> 05:35.199
The important thing is that it's a place

05:35.201 --> 05:37.093
we can hang out and
talk after the meeting.

05:37.118 --> 05:38.534
She's right.

05:38.559 --> 05:40.926
So, what's new with you, Jill?

05:41.703 --> 05:45.509
Well, I've been having
a little health issue.

05:45.511 --> 05:47.545
I...

05:51.335 --> 05:54.218
- Hello.
- 'Sup?

05:56.109 --> 05:57.555
Do we know him?

05:57.557 --> 05:59.223
These are communal tables.

05:59.225 --> 06:02.224
Oh, dear Lord. Where are we, Cuba?

06:04.197 --> 06:05.794
Somebody else talk.

06:06.568 --> 06:09.817
Okay, well, I still haven't heard from

06:09.819 --> 06:12.453
any of the law schools I
applied to, but I'm really...

06:12.455 --> 06:14.155
Oh. That's me.

06:14.157 --> 06:15.706
Back to you, Jill.

06:16.364 --> 06:17.779
Fine.

06:19.162 --> 06:20.578
I've been having a little trouble

06:20.580 --> 06:22.246
Down there.

06:22.552 --> 06:24.916
So, I went to my gyno,

06:24.918 --> 06:25.967
and he said

06:25.969 --> 06:27.966
the problem is bicycle shorts.

06:28.228 --> 06:30.645
I'm sorry, honey, you're
cutting in and out.

06:33.009 --> 06:35.849
Oh. Wheels up, Marge. It's go time.

06:37.569 --> 06:39.686
My girlfriend was having that problem.

06:39.758 --> 06:42.677
She's had good luck
with organic fabrics.

06:44.072 --> 06:46.200
Oh, good, you're weighing in.

06:47.497 --> 06:50.908
Turns out the four, six
and nine were all beverages.

06:55.630 --> 06:58.489
- Mom, you ready to go?
- Almost.

06:59.329 --> 07:02.029
- What are you doing?
- Eating a sandwich.

07:02.366 --> 07:04.617
Then when we go out to
dinner, I'll just order coffee,

07:04.642 --> 07:06.857
and people will feel bad
for me and buy me pudding.

07:08.255 --> 07:09.961
Oh, my God, hold on.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.599
Mm. Please tell me we won
Publishers Clearing House.

07:12.741 --> 07:15.615
Get real, Mom. You have to have
a screen door to win that thing.

07:16.478 --> 07:21.361
- Stanford Law School.
- Mm! Open it!

07:21.540 --> 07:24.025
I'm scared.

07:24.394 --> 07:27.478
I know it's a long shot, but
there's still that part of me

07:27.480 --> 07:29.063
that thinks that maybe there's a chance.

07:29.065 --> 07:30.595
Oh, I have that little part, too.

07:30.798 --> 07:32.631
It's like how I think that one day

07:32.656 --> 07:34.373
I might win an Olympic gold medal.

07:34.398 --> 07:36.097
You know, something easy like luge.

07:41.001 --> 07:42.576
What's it say?

07:43.751 --> 07:46.446
They "regret to inform" me.

07:46.916 --> 07:48.478
What?

07:49.275 --> 07:51.986
Mom, they don't regret to inform you

07:52.011 --> 07:53.928
that your dreams are coming true.

07:54.587 --> 07:57.341
Oh. Honey, I'm sorry.

07:58.118 --> 08:00.173
I knew the numbers weren't in my favor,

08:00.198 --> 08:03.180
but my personal essay was so sad

08:03.182 --> 08:05.782
I thought I might just be
able to guilt them into it.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.602
My name come up?

08:10.484 --> 08:13.685
You can't write about World War
Two without bringing up Hitler.

08:16.493 --> 08:17.945
It's okay.

08:17.947 --> 08:19.864
I've got other applications out there,

08:19.866 --> 08:23.172
and worst case, there's
always North Valley Law School.

08:23.197 --> 08:24.529
Go, Centipedes.

08:25.812 --> 08:28.729
And I'll still be a lawyer,
which is all that matters.

08:29.040 --> 08:31.008
I'll just hang my diploma in the garage.

08:31.010 --> 08:33.376
- We don't have a garage.
- We don't have a garage,

08:33.379 --> 08:34.876
we don't have a screen
door; what do we have?

08:34.900 --> 08:37.571
- Each other.
- Way to kick me when I'm down.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.602
So, where do you guys want to eat?

08:41.604 --> 08:43.854
I'm willing to give
Christy's place another shot

08:43.856 --> 08:45.728
now that I know how it works.

08:45.938 --> 08:48.251
I went online and found a forum.

08:48.939 --> 08:52.473
Are you out of your mind?
I had to bus my own tray.

08:52.498 --> 08:54.853
My own tray. Tray!

08:57.151 --> 08:58.734
I liked the chili.

08:58.759 --> 09:01.843
It was comforting, just
like Mom never made.

09:03.826 --> 09:05.659
On Monday, they throw in corn bread,

09:05.661 --> 09:07.071
but you have to know to ask.

09:07.962 --> 09:09.747
Marjorie, what'd you think?

09:10.016 --> 09:13.000
Oh, um, I appreciate the fact

09:13.002 --> 09:15.252
that Christy brought a
new idea into our world.

09:15.254 --> 09:17.588
P.U.

09:18.048 --> 09:20.424
Hey, you know what? You
threw us a curveball,

09:20.426 --> 09:22.426
and Christy did her best
to find a compromise.

09:22.428 --> 09:23.894
Was it an epic fail? Yes.

09:23.896 --> 09:26.263
Are we gonna be less open to
her suggestions in the future?

09:26.265 --> 09:27.902
Absolutely, but she tried.

09:29.902 --> 09:33.487
Well, I'm really in the mood
for a Cobb salad from the bistro,

09:33.489 --> 09:36.448
hold the ham, cheese, bacon,
egg, balsamic on the side.

09:36.609 --> 09:39.300
Why don't we do that, and I'll
pay for Bonnie and Christy?

09:39.325 --> 09:41.766
No, no, no, we're not
looking for charity.

09:42.310 --> 09:44.026
Well, that's new.

09:45.008 --> 09:46.617
What?

09:46.619 --> 09:48.669
Never bothered you when I was paying.

09:49.024 --> 09:53.430
Hey, we never asked you to
pay; you just started doing it.

09:53.543 --> 09:56.460
I started doing it because the
check would sit on the table

09:56.462 --> 09:57.928
for an hour if I didn't.

09:58.664 --> 10:01.453
But now I'm done with you
all taking advantage of me.

10:01.478 --> 10:03.539
Hey, get over yourself.
You bought me a couple of sandwiches,

10:03.564 --> 10:05.313
not a Lincoln Town Car.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.772
Oh, I'm sorry my personal
growth doesn't work for you.

10:08.774 --> 10:11.058
Hey, if I had a spare
65 grand laying around,

10:11.060 --> 10:13.310
I'd fly to a spa and
buy some growth, too.

10:13.312 --> 10:15.789
Maybe we ought to just
take a moment and breathe.

10:15.814 --> 10:17.781
Hey, stand down, Grey Gardens.

10:18.164 --> 10:20.383
If Jill wants to grow, we
should tell her the truth.

10:20.408 --> 10:21.602
Well, here's some truth.

10:21.627 --> 10:23.794
I'm only seven years older than you.

10:24.188 --> 10:26.138
Seven hard years, apparently.

10:27.210 --> 10:29.577
I don't like it when we all fight.

10:29.579 --> 10:32.796
- Not now, Wendy.
- You not now!

10:34.316 --> 10:36.000
You know what? I'm skipping the bistro.

10:36.002 --> 10:37.384
I got better things to do than

10:37.386 --> 10:39.003
watch Christy yammering
on about law school,

10:39.005 --> 10:42.506
Wendy crying for no reason,
Marjorie and her lame advice,

10:42.508 --> 10:45.342
and Bonnie trying to
have sex with her pudding.

10:47.183 --> 10:50.377
Well, I'm just gonna say it.

10:50.402 --> 10:53.202
She was nicer when she was fat.

10:57.296 --> 10:58.863
You know what else pisses me off?

10:58.888 --> 11:00.730
Watching Jaws here.

11:01.340 --> 11:04.894
Jill is proof that money is
wasted on the wrong people.

11:04.919 --> 11:06.802
Look, topless girl wading in the water.

11:06.827 --> 11:09.347
Uh-oh, what could happen?

11:10.535 --> 11:12.501
I just don't buy this movie.

11:12.503 --> 11:14.853
The chief of police has that
kind of waterfront property?

11:15.144 --> 11:16.672
It was the '70s.

11:16.674 --> 11:18.373
It was a totally different
real estate market.

11:18.375 --> 11:20.259
You know what? You're ruining it.

11:20.261 --> 11:23.178
I'll tell you what, if Jill
was in charge of that town,

11:23.180 --> 11:25.047
she would've sold that house
right out from under him,

11:25.049 --> 11:26.298
'cause that's what the rich do.

11:26.300 --> 11:28.730
They screw the hardworking
little guy like me.

11:29.053 --> 11:31.378
You're neither one of those.

11:32.620 --> 11:34.773
It's just the injustice of it.

11:34.775 --> 11:36.892
What do you think?

11:36.894 --> 11:39.027
Me? I think this is something

11:39.029 --> 11:42.364
that you and the gals would
have a lot of fun talking about.

11:43.347 --> 11:45.072
I haven't talked to them in four days,

11:45.097 --> 11:46.535
and I don't miss them at all.

11:46.537 --> 11:50.072
Well, your only other option is
to relax and watch Jaws with me.

11:50.074 --> 11:53.081
Sure. Fine. Great.

11:56.933 --> 11:58.881
Is this where they came
up with "jump the shark"?

11:58.883 --> 12:00.378
'Cause this is awful.

12:07.354 --> 12:11.179
Ah, North Valley School of Law.

12:12.084 --> 12:15.335
The time has come for us
to settle for each other.

12:29.697 --> 12:31.446
Hey. Hey.

12:31.448 --> 12:34.750
It's been suggested to
me by my loving fiancé

12:34.752 --> 12:37.252
that I might like to get
my "bitter, angry ass"

12:37.254 --> 12:39.254
to a meeting. Care to join?

12:39.256 --> 12:41.173
No, I got work to do.

12:41.175 --> 12:42.541
Okay. Just a heads up,

12:42.543 --> 12:44.676
he's in there watching
Jaws like it's Zookeeper.

12:44.678 --> 12:47.227
At least in that one the animals talk.

12:53.270 --> 12:54.660
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:54.685 --> 12:57.559
- Watching Jaws.
- I heard.

13:00.504 --> 13:01.777
You okay?

13:02.528 --> 13:05.063
I don't want to bother you;
you're watching your movie.

13:05.065 --> 13:07.032
I can pause it. But don't tell your mom.

13:07.034 --> 13:08.734
I wouldn't do it for her.

13:10.010 --> 13:11.426
So what's up?

13:18.412 --> 13:20.579
I didn't get into law school.

13:23.152 --> 13:26.254
- Which one?
- All of them.

13:27.554 --> 13:29.638
This was my last hope.

13:29.640 --> 13:31.605
Aw, Christy, I'm so sorry.

13:32.810 --> 13:36.762
This has been the entire focus
of my life for four years.

13:37.803 --> 13:40.379
It never occurred to me I
wouldn't get in anywhere.

13:42.035 --> 13:43.819
So what do you do now?

13:44.527 --> 13:46.012
I don't know.

13:46.716 --> 13:48.465
What'd your mom say?

13:50.184 --> 13:51.921
I didn't tell her.

13:51.946 --> 13:53.624
I'm too embarrassed.

13:57.534 --> 13:59.319
I want to say the right thing, but...

14:00.287 --> 14:02.014
I don't know what that is.

14:02.456 --> 14:05.327
Do you maybe want me to
call Marjorie or Jill or...

14:05.881 --> 14:07.803
What's that other one's name?

14:09.780 --> 14:13.098
They don't want to hear
about me and school anymore.

14:13.100 --> 14:14.546
Well, then...

14:16.900 --> 14:18.399
That...

14:19.965 --> 14:22.814
That's a real pickle.

14:25.775 --> 14:28.517
- Pickle?
- Sorry.

14:29.400 --> 14:32.784
It's okay. I'm just gonna go upstairs.

14:35.134 --> 14:36.705
Here's something.

14:36.707 --> 14:39.884
When a door closes, a window opens.

14:39.909 --> 14:42.076
Thanks, all better!

14:44.683 --> 14:47.810
- Hey. Jill. Alcoholic.
- Hi, Jill.

14:47.835 --> 14:49.885
First of all, I don't know
who came up with having

14:49.887 --> 14:52.898
a candlelight meeting, but kudos.

14:52.923 --> 14:55.223
I'm sure it's all about
being spiritual and whatnot,

14:55.225 --> 14:56.925
but I appreciate it on a day

14:56.927 --> 14:58.900
when I didn't get to touch up my makeup.

14:59.930 --> 15:04.433
Anyway, I don't usually
come to this meeting,

15:04.435 --> 15:06.376
but I'm avoiding some folks.

15:09.105 --> 15:13.608
Um, this isn't easy to share about...

15:16.196 --> 15:19.164
... but, um, I have a lot of money.

15:19.166 --> 15:21.025
I always have.

15:21.345 --> 15:23.494
And I know that sounds great,

15:23.659 --> 15:27.330
and it is sometimes, like
when you want to buy stuff.

15:28.926 --> 15:31.259
But I've never been able
to trust whether or not

15:31.261 --> 15:33.176
people were in my life
for the right reasons.

15:34.465 --> 15:38.002
Like did my classmates want to
attend my 13th birthday party,

15:38.027 --> 15:39.468
or did they just want to go to Maui?

15:39.470 --> 15:40.910
I don't know.

15:42.040 --> 15:43.676
I'll never know.

15:45.809 --> 15:48.193
I thought I finally found some friends

15:48.195 --> 15:51.279
who loved me for who I am,
but the second I stopped

15:51.281 --> 15:53.559
picking up the check,
everything went to hell.

15:56.233 --> 15:58.887
And I-I don't expect
you to feel sorry for me.

16:00.049 --> 16:02.441
But you should 'cause it's hard.

16:03.653 --> 16:08.965
Also, apropos of nothing,
I recently lost 115 pounds.

16:13.466 --> 16:15.850
Hey, Christy, over here!

16:16.056 --> 16:17.889
Oh, hey, Brendan.

16:17.891 --> 16:20.175
Yeah, come on! Come on.
Over here. Come here.

16:20.177 --> 16:22.177
Come on. Sit down.

16:22.179 --> 16:24.596
Come here. Come on. Yeah.

16:24.598 --> 16:26.398
Hey, what's your poison?

16:26.400 --> 16:29.101
Uh, sadly, gazpacho.

16:30.010 --> 16:32.404
I really wanted the chili...
Like, I needed the chili...

16:32.406 --> 16:33.713
But they were out.

16:33.738 --> 16:36.158
Cool. I'm kind of drunk.

16:36.743 --> 16:38.410
Uh, but we're celebrating.

16:38.412 --> 16:40.549
Uh, Jessica, Tom and
Leo got into UCLA Law,

16:40.574 --> 16:42.991
I got into Berkeley, and
Leslie's going to North Valley.

16:43.951 --> 16:45.584
Hey, what can I say?

16:45.586 --> 16:47.189
It's a school.

16:49.205 --> 16:51.123
Brendan, how did you get into

16:51.125 --> 16:53.390
the most prestigious law
school on the West Coast?

16:53.415 --> 16:55.537
Adderall and luck.

16:58.799 --> 17:01.193
... and the wisdom
to know the difference.

17:01.218 --> 17:03.435
Amen.

17:10.477 --> 17:14.208
- Oh. Hello.
- Yeah, it's me.

17:15.912 --> 17:17.648
Looks like we were

17:17.651 --> 17:20.152
avoiding each other at the same meeting.

17:21.989 --> 17:23.762
I heard your share.

17:24.490 --> 17:26.241
It wasn't about you.

17:27.243 --> 17:29.192
Entirely.

17:30.395 --> 17:33.665
I guess one of the good
things about being poor is

17:33.667 --> 17:36.427
I never had to worry about why
people wanted to be my friend.

17:37.175 --> 17:39.148
Except of course when I had blow.

17:39.173 --> 17:42.302
Oh, yeah. Everybody loves
you when you're holding.

17:46.108 --> 17:48.692
I'm sorry about what happened.

17:50.154 --> 17:52.984
And I want you to know
that I'd be your friend

17:52.986 --> 17:54.450
whether you had money or not.

17:56.035 --> 17:57.501
And I know you're mine,

17:57.526 --> 18:00.099
'cause let's face it,
I come with zero perks.

18:01.060 --> 18:03.028
Not a one.

18:10.871 --> 18:13.088
Yeah.

18:13.090 --> 18:15.019
So where did you get in?

18:15.592 --> 18:16.847
I didn't.

18:17.177 --> 18:18.593
Nowhere?

18:18.793 --> 18:22.058
- Nope. You?
- Nothing.

18:22.316 --> 18:25.600
Kicking myself for not
applying to North Valley.

18:25.602 --> 18:27.602
They accept anyone with a pulse.

18:28.291 --> 18:30.588
I am proof that's not true.

18:30.891 --> 18:33.942
No way. You didn't
get into North Valley?!

18:33.944 --> 18:35.455
Keep it down.

18:35.812 --> 18:37.862
Sorry.

18:37.864 --> 18:42.400
Well, in that case, I think that
you need this more than I do.

18:57.050 --> 18:58.749
Hello?

18:59.556 --> 19:01.723
Oh, hey, Jill.

19:04.887 --> 19:06.897
I'm glad you called.

19:13.288 --> 19:14.838
I just want to make it really clear,

19:14.840 --> 19:17.520
I am buying Jill an iced
tea and a side salad.

19:17.545 --> 19:19.626
The rest of you are on your
own, so order accordingly.

19:20.639 --> 19:22.361
I kind of wanted to pay for Jill.

19:22.363 --> 19:23.395
You do it next time.

19:23.397 --> 19:24.980
But if you want to order
fries for the table,

19:24.982 --> 19:25.981
no one's gonna stop you.

19:26.186 --> 19:28.201
I want to make a toast.

19:28.368 --> 19:30.334
To us.

19:30.359 --> 19:32.893
Not being able to talk to
you guys was really terrible.

19:32.918 --> 19:35.836
Tell me about it. I felt so useless.

19:35.910 --> 19:37.126
I was so lonely.

19:37.128 --> 19:39.597
Apparently, I became "irritating."

19:40.307 --> 19:42.390
And I almost drank. Cheers.

19:42.416 --> 19:43.749
Wait, what?

19:43.751 --> 19:45.718
Sweetie, what happened?

19:46.300 --> 19:48.254
Are you sure you want to know?

19:48.256 --> 19:51.347
It's a "Christy goes
back to school" story.

19:51.777 --> 19:53.527
Of course we want to know.

19:56.564 --> 19:59.982
I didn't get into any of
the law schools I applied to.

20:00.478 --> 20:02.663
- Oh, no.
- Oh, that sucks. I'm sorry.

20:02.853 --> 20:04.653
Why didn't you tell me?

20:05.206 --> 20:07.022
I don't know.

20:07.024 --> 20:09.089
Shock, shame.

20:09.117 --> 20:10.750
Oh, honey.

20:10.995 --> 20:12.604
Um, we're ready to order.

20:12.629 --> 20:14.580
And... could you keep the
coffee coming please,

20:14.582 --> 20:16.282
'cause we're gonna be here for a while.
