WEBVTT

00:01.034 --> 00:02.235
Only on Fox.

00:03.937 --> 00:07.841
Narrator:
Tonight on "MasterChef,"

00:07.875 --> 00:10.544
only five remain.

00:10.578 --> 00:12.980
- Ashley...
- Amazing.

00:13.013 --> 00:16.984
It confirms that I was
a hundred percent correct
handing you that apron.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.318
...Gerron...

00:18.351 --> 00:20.153
- Joe: Amazing job.
- Thank you.

00:20.187 --> 00:21.989
No, thank you
for being on my team,

00:22.022 --> 00:23.857
and coming out
as a real contender.

00:23.891 --> 00:26.059
- ...Bowen...
- Incredibly delicious.

00:26.093 --> 00:27.828
That's what this competition
is all about.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.663
- There's no stopping you,
is there?
- No.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.665
...Cesar...

00:31.699 --> 00:34.001
Really phenomenal job.
It gives me a lot of joy,

00:34.034 --> 00:35.903
'cause not only
do you have my pin,

00:35.936 --> 00:39.372
you're a great representative
for our culture and our food.

00:39.406 --> 00:42.209
- ...Samantha.
- Delicious.

00:42.242 --> 00:43.777
You've been
a perfect student.

00:43.811 --> 00:45.779
- Now, flick your hair,
- Oh.

00:45.813 --> 00:48.015
so Joe and AarÃ³n can see
whose pin you're wearing.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.417
- But in the end...
- This is it.

00:50.450 --> 00:52.285
Semifinals, baby!

00:52.319 --> 00:55.288
...just one will
claim the title of

00:55.322 --> 00:56.824
MasterChef.

01:07.100 --> 01:08.468
- Ashley: Whoo!
- Gerron: Top five, baby!

01:08.501 --> 01:09.703
Welcome back, guys.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.538
Oh, my.

01:11.571 --> 01:14.407
I'm a 28-year-old woman
from Opa-Locka, Florida,

01:14.441 --> 01:15.876
who's a professional
grocery shopper.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.646
Welcome back.

01:18.679 --> 01:23.550
Ashley:
I have worked my behind off
to be top five,

01:23.583 --> 01:29.556
and now I'm going up against
four other really strong cooks,

01:29.589 --> 01:30.924
so I gotta bring it.

01:33.126 --> 01:34.828
( softly )
Oh. Okay.

01:34.862 --> 01:37.597
All five of you
are clearly talented.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.432
You each have
the culinary potential

01:39.466 --> 01:43.070
to take home the title
of MasterChef,

01:43.103 --> 01:47.675
but only one of you can win
the ultimate victory.

01:47.708 --> 01:52.012
So tonight,
we are raising the stakes.

01:52.045 --> 01:56.149
You're about to face
a series of tests,

01:56.183 --> 01:59.687
and your aim is to get yourself
safe in the balcony.

01:59.720 --> 02:02.790
Now, to survive tonight,
you are gonna have to conquer

02:02.823 --> 02:05.592
a truly colossal protein.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.494
America was built on it.

02:07.527 --> 02:09.029
America still devours it.

02:09.062 --> 02:11.665
And chefs still worship it.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.769
- What is that?
- Wow!

02:15.803 --> 02:16.804
Goodness.

02:20.173 --> 02:21.975
( whispers )
Oh, my God.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.446
- Gordon: Beef.
- Damn, that's big.

02:26.479 --> 02:30.117
Tonight, to make it
one step closer to
the "MasterChef" finale,

02:30.150 --> 02:34.487
you are gonna have to create
MasterChef-worthy masterpieces

02:34.521 --> 02:36.456
using this.

02:36.489 --> 02:39.559
Beef makes today's challenge
more of a level playing field,

02:39.592 --> 02:41.528
because it's a common protein.

02:41.561 --> 02:43.163
We've all used it
in this competition,

02:43.196 --> 02:45.799
so it really is gonna
come down to technique,

02:45.833 --> 02:47.735
flavor, seasoning.

02:47.768 --> 02:50.403
A tiny detail will make
some huge difference.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.506
AarÃ³n:
Home cooks...

02:55.743 --> 02:58.011
...your first battle
for survival

02:58.045 --> 03:00.513
will involve all five of you.

03:00.547 --> 03:04.017
All five of you will cook
at these stations.

03:04.051 --> 03:08.856
From here, two of you
will be made safe.

03:08.889 --> 03:12.159
The other three will still be
standing in the firing line...

03:12.192 --> 03:15.896
Facing another challenge.

03:15.929 --> 03:17.530
- Oh, wow.
- From the three

03:17.564 --> 03:19.099
that battle
at these stations,

03:19.132 --> 03:21.668
one of you
will be lucky enough

03:21.701 --> 03:24.838
to take a place safe
up on the balcony.

03:24.872 --> 03:28.842
The other two will be left
staring elimination...

03:28.876 --> 03:30.543
In the face.

03:30.577 --> 03:33.013
If you still haven't made it
to safety,

03:33.046 --> 03:36.016
your shot at lifting that
incredible MasterChef trophy

03:36.049 --> 03:39.920
will be on the line,
right here.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.554
Two of you will
go head to head

03:41.588 --> 03:44.591
in a straight
all-or-nothing fight.

03:44.624 --> 03:46.093
One will still have a shot

03:46.126 --> 03:48.695
of becoming America's
next MasterChef.

03:48.728 --> 03:53.533
The other will walk out
those doors with nothing.

03:53.566 --> 03:56.970
Now, home cooks, follow me.

03:57.004 --> 03:59.039
I know it gets harder and harder

03:59.072 --> 04:02.042
as you get closer
to the end of today.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.912
My food dream is to go
to culinary school,

04:04.945 --> 04:06.947
and that seems so close
right now.

04:06.980 --> 04:09.950
So getting up
to that balcony ASAP

04:09.983 --> 04:11.584
is the first thing I need to do.

04:11.618 --> 04:15.155
This first challenge
is a great test

04:15.188 --> 04:18.058
of your beef skills.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.060
It looks simple,
but believe me,

04:20.093 --> 04:22.095
it's deceivingly difficult
to get right.

04:22.129 --> 04:24.097
Beef kabobs.

04:24.131 --> 04:26.066
Hmm.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.401
AarÃ³n:
The New York strip has
to be cooked cleanly,

04:28.435 --> 04:31.671
cooked evenly,
and seasoned to perfection.

04:31.704 --> 04:34.507
You can add your choice
of vegetables and seasoning

04:34.541 --> 04:37.644
to put your own personal
touch on them.

04:37.677 --> 04:42.649
If you get these right, it could
land you up on that balcony.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.019
But if you get these wrong,

04:46.053 --> 04:50.657
you'll have an even more
difficult challenge
ahead of you.

04:50.690 --> 04:53.593
Please, all of you,
head to your stations.

04:53.626 --> 04:56.463
I make beef skewers
in my backyard all the time,

04:56.496 --> 04:58.465
but the fact that I'm doing it
in the MasterChef kitchen,

04:58.498 --> 05:00.000
they have to be elevated.

05:00.033 --> 05:02.802
So, I cannot let Joe down.

05:02.836 --> 05:06.106
And the fact that I'm the last
one standing with his apron,

05:06.139 --> 05:08.641
I need to make sure
I get to that balcony.

05:08.675 --> 05:11.611
At your stations,
you'll find everything you need

05:11.644 --> 05:13.947
to make us beef kabobs.

05:13.981 --> 05:17.184
New York strip steak,
peppers, button mushrooms,

05:17.217 --> 05:20.487
lemon, garlic,
red wine vinegar, and limes.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.655
You'll all have just 30 minutes

05:22.689 --> 05:26.793
to make us three
perfectly cooked beef kabobs.

05:26.826 --> 05:28.828
- Is everybody ready?
- All: Yes, Chef.

05:28.862 --> 05:31.865
Your 30 minutes starts now.

05:35.702 --> 05:38.872
Kabob is the global
street food.

05:38.906 --> 05:42.509
Because really, it's about
what else you put with it,

05:42.542 --> 05:45.545
how you cook it,
and the seasoning.

05:45.578 --> 05:47.847
This is all about techniques
and guaranteed,

05:47.881 --> 05:50.850
- this challenge will
definitely separate them.
- Mm-hmm.

05:50.884 --> 05:54.654
Samantha:
I'm a little nervous, because I
don't do much grilling at home,

05:54.687 --> 05:56.489
but I think the key
to my success is gonna

05:56.523 --> 05:59.392
be marinating the steak
to perfection.

05:59.426 --> 06:02.095
So, I'm hoping that with
these Mediterranean flavors,

06:02.129 --> 06:03.830
I can knock it out of the park.

06:03.863 --> 06:06.366
The most difficult part
of the kabob challenge

06:06.399 --> 06:09.169
is making sure everything gets
cooked and seasoned properly.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.671
- How do you do that?
- Number one, first of all,

06:11.704 --> 06:13.506
I'm looking for that level
of continuity.

06:13.540 --> 06:17.377
Match up one cube,
even the peppers,

06:17.410 --> 06:19.546
even the mushrooms--
the same size.

06:19.579 --> 06:23.216
I don't wanna see big,
long strips of pepper,
tiny strips of beef.

06:23.250 --> 06:24.751
I want it all looking
evenly done.

06:24.784 --> 06:26.019
There's three.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.687
You know, if I was at home,

06:27.720 --> 06:29.556
I would just simply chop
the meat up any type of way.

06:29.589 --> 06:31.858
But the fact that I'm
in the MasterChef kitchen,

06:31.891 --> 06:34.027
12.
I have to make sure

06:34.061 --> 06:36.596
that every size of the beef
is perfect

06:36.629 --> 06:40.968
so that it cooks perfect
on top of the flavor profile.

06:41.001 --> 06:43.703
So, I'm going jerk seasoning
for these skewers.

06:43.736 --> 06:45.939
Gordon:
Then from there, you marinate it
all together in a bowl

06:45.973 --> 06:47.207
for at least ten minutes.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.641
That helps to tenderize
everything.

06:48.675 --> 06:49.809
It starts to break down
those peppers

06:49.842 --> 06:51.378
so they're not so crunchy.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.880
Where's cumin powder?
Cumin, cumin, cumin.

06:53.913 --> 06:56.116
Just coming up
to 15 minutes to go.

06:57.917 --> 07:01.654
I will make a traditional
Asian flavor beef skewer.

07:01.688 --> 07:05.425
In China, we eat beef skewers
all the time.

07:05.458 --> 07:09.596
I know the flavor,
but I never grill meat before.

07:09.629 --> 07:11.731
We always cook with charcoal,

07:11.764 --> 07:13.833
so that is the challenge for me.

07:13.866 --> 07:16.736
- Whoo-hoo!
- I only have one apron left
and that's Cesar.

07:16.769 --> 07:18.405
I gotta believe

07:18.438 --> 07:19.973
that he's really gonna knock it
out of the park here

07:20.007 --> 07:22.075
'cause he has such a deft hand
with seasoning,

07:22.109 --> 07:24.577
and he knows how to move fast.

07:24.611 --> 07:27.614
Cesar:
Tonight I'm going
with traditional flavors.

07:27.647 --> 07:31.018
This challenge is the best
chance to be safe.

07:31.051 --> 07:34.421
So I'm moving as fast as I've
ever moved in this competition

07:34.454 --> 07:36.156
with precision, with speed.

07:36.189 --> 07:39.659
I wanna make sure that I squeeze
the most out of these 30 minutes

07:39.692 --> 07:41.961
to secure a spot
in the top four.

07:43.163 --> 07:45.965
Gordon:
Ten minutes remaining.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.867
Sam and Bowen have huge pieces.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.337
They've cut their beef
into an inch and a half length.

07:50.370 --> 07:51.771
Yellow pepper.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.973
AarÃ³n:
Gerron's skewers look great.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.509
He's got the technique
of a surgeon.

07:56.543 --> 07:58.478
Joe:
Uh-oh.

07:58.511 --> 08:01.481
Bowen has made a technical error
on the cut of his vegetables.

08:01.514 --> 08:03.450
He's julienned them.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.018
Gordon:
I don't understand
what he's doing there.

08:05.052 --> 08:07.454
I know he's wearing my apron,
but yet again,

08:07.487 --> 08:09.956
he's refusing to listen.
We didn't ask for strips.

08:09.989 --> 08:12.792
Joe:
How is he gonna
skewer those?

08:12.825 --> 08:14.561
Has Bowen lost his mind?

08:22.735 --> 08:25.472
Uh-oh. Bowen has made
a technical error

08:25.505 --> 08:27.174
on the cut
of his vegetables.

08:27.207 --> 08:29.076
He's julienned them.

08:29.109 --> 08:30.577
Gordon:
We didn't ask for slices.

08:30.610 --> 08:32.379
Joe:
How is he gonna
skewer those?

08:32.412 --> 08:34.147
Six minutes to go.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.416
( singing )

08:38.251 --> 08:42.222
So, with six minutes to go,
they should be cooking those,

08:42.255 --> 08:45.024
because we're looking
for medium rare.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.560
Three minutes each side,
and you brush.

08:47.594 --> 08:49.596
So it's like almost clockwork.

08:49.629 --> 08:51.198
You turn every 30 seconds.

08:51.231 --> 08:52.732
Brush, turn, brush, turn.

08:52.765 --> 08:55.535
Two minutes remaining.

08:55.568 --> 08:57.737
- Finish up.
- AarÃ³n: Come on, everyone,
let's go.

08:57.770 --> 09:00.273
Think about your plating.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.342
Bowen, being Chinese,
is always used to cooking

09:02.375 --> 09:04.077
with super high heat.

09:04.111 --> 09:06.613
That can be very good.
I hope it works for him today.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.751
60 seconds remaining.

09:11.784 --> 09:14.087
Last minute.

09:14.121 --> 09:15.622
Cesar's plating, look.

09:15.655 --> 09:18.691
AarÃ³n:
Gerron's skewers look great.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.193
Samantha's just taking hers
out of the oven.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.262
Why'd she put them in the oven?

09:22.295 --> 09:26.633
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

09:26.666 --> 09:30.803
five, four, three, two, one.

09:30.837 --> 09:32.472
- Gordon: And stop.
Hands in the air.
- Joe: Stop.

09:32.505 --> 09:33.706
Gordon:
Well done.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.775
All of you, very carefully,

09:35.808 --> 09:37.777
bring your kabobs down
to the front bench.

09:37.810 --> 09:42.215
I have really big confident
in myself.

09:42.249 --> 09:46.553
They're colorful and the grill
mark is really, really perfect.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.255
I do think the flavor is there.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.623
I just hope
it will be medium rare.

09:50.657 --> 09:53.059
AarÃ³n:
We're looking for two of you

09:53.092 --> 09:56.563
that we will save and send
straight up to the balcony.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.299
First up, Bowen.
Describe your kabob.

09:59.332 --> 10:02.469
Beef kabob marinade
with lemon juice,

10:02.502 --> 10:05.305
olive oil, cumin,
paprika,

10:05.338 --> 10:07.240
salt and pepper,
and garlic.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.809
So, visually,
it's definitely colorful,

10:09.842 --> 10:12.312
but why all the garnish
underneath?

10:12.345 --> 10:16.115
I sautÃ© in the pan,
because I want to put
the flavor underneath

10:16.149 --> 10:17.817
and then the kabob layer
on there.

10:17.850 --> 10:22.422
A kabob traditionally is eaten
on the skewer, one bite.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.857
You just changed the dish
completely again,

10:24.891 --> 10:27.294
which we don't want you to.

10:27.327 --> 10:31.130
So, the cook on the beef,
beautiful.

10:31.164 --> 10:33.866
Temperature, spot-on.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.271
Seasoning's on point,

10:38.305 --> 10:42.475
but the peppers
on the skewer are raw,

10:42.509 --> 10:44.444
and the peppers underneath
are cooked.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.347
And I want the peppers
on the skewer cooked.

10:48.381 --> 10:49.716
Thank you.

10:51.551 --> 10:53.152
Samantha.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.555
You've taken on a very
different strategy

10:55.588 --> 10:57.357
- than everybody else.
- Mm-hmm.

10:57.390 --> 11:00.727
You just decided
to completely
omit the peppers.

11:02.262 --> 11:04.364
The flavor profile is
Mediterranean.

11:04.397 --> 11:06.233
I didn't see the peppers
fitting in.

11:06.266 --> 11:07.834
How did you cook these?
I mean, you have grill marks

11:07.867 --> 11:09.469
- but they're sporadic and--
- Uh-- yeah.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.471
I cooked most of it
on the grill,

11:11.504 --> 11:14.707
but when I cut one open,
it was a little underdone

11:14.741 --> 11:17.477
and I decided to put it
in the oven.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.746
- It's a little under.
- Oh, it's-- that's rare.

11:19.779 --> 11:21.448
Okay.

11:24.917 --> 11:27.153
The flavor of the beef
is okay,

11:27.186 --> 11:29.322
but you took a strategy
that was minimalistic,

11:29.356 --> 11:32.559
and I think, unfortunately,
that also reflects
in the way they taste.

11:32.592 --> 11:35.228
- Okay, okay.
- Very minimal.

11:35.262 --> 11:36.429
Okay.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.601
- Gerron.
- Hi, Chef.

11:41.634 --> 11:43.169
Visually they look beautiful.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.238
- Good color.
- Thank you, Chef.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.073
What type of marinade is
in the kabob?

11:47.106 --> 11:48.708
Uh, so I tried to get close

11:48.741 --> 11:50.343
- to like a jerk marinade.
- Jerk.

11:50.377 --> 11:53.413
Mushroom, two peppers,
and the red onion.

11:58.117 --> 12:00.553
The cook on the beef...

12:02.289 --> 12:03.856
...pink and beautiful.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.425
And you really charred them.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.126
That's the essence
of that grill.

12:07.159 --> 12:08.728
That's what the kabob stands
for, right?

12:08.761 --> 12:10.530
But the bit that lifts me is
that jerk seasoning,

12:10.563 --> 12:13.600
which traditionally you don't
really get with a kabob.

12:13.633 --> 12:14.834
Good job.

12:16.135 --> 12:18.438
Ashley.

12:18.471 --> 12:21.741
First of all, you got
a beautiful marinade
on the outside.

12:21.774 --> 12:24.143
I think you were very
generous with the seasoning.
I like that.

12:24.176 --> 12:27.113
I was going for
those Latin flavors.

12:27.146 --> 12:30.650
The beef was marinated
in lemon and lime juice,

12:30.683 --> 12:33.386
garlic, oil, cumin,
coriander,

12:33.420 --> 12:35.288
and some red chili flakes.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.427
I got a real fatty piece.

12:40.460 --> 12:43.330
I think you could've butchered
them down a little bit better,

12:43.363 --> 12:46.333
but you did cook them well.
I like the seasoning.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.267
Peppers and the chimichurri,
you have a home run.

12:48.301 --> 12:51.103
But just kinda shifting gears
on some of the elements

12:51.137 --> 12:53.239
would've made this
spot-on.

12:53.272 --> 12:54.441
Okay.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.280
- Cesar.
- Hi, Chef.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.649
Visually, they look good.

13:02.682 --> 13:04.451
Describe your kabob.

13:04.484 --> 13:07.354
So I put both bell peppers,
onion, oregano, garlic,

13:07.387 --> 13:09.822
then red wine vinegar
marinade,

13:09.856 --> 13:11.591
'cause I really wanted
to pack flavor into them.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.460
- Beautiful cook.
- Thank you.

13:13.493 --> 13:14.861
- Medium rare.
- Mm-hmm.

13:15.862 --> 13:17.497
Mmm.

13:17.530 --> 13:20.132
It's cooked beautifully.
Love the marks on there.

13:20.166 --> 13:21.834
The seasoning's on point.

13:21.868 --> 13:23.336
Love the color.

13:23.370 --> 13:24.804
You know your sticks
are bountiful,

13:24.837 --> 13:27.139
but the one mistake
you made is giving a--

13:27.173 --> 13:29.942
an expensive cut of beef
red wine vinegar.

13:29.976 --> 13:33.112
It doesn't need that kick.

13:33.145 --> 13:35.181
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Chef.

13:36.182 --> 13:38.117
Colors wise, beautiful.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.486
- It's got that char mark
on there as well.
- Yeah.

13:39.519 --> 13:42.321
That right there shows
a lot of promise.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.190
- Also, uniform, right?
- Yeah.

13:44.223 --> 13:46.158
- You know, consistent.
- That's important, absolutely.

13:46.192 --> 13:47.727
AarÃ³n:
It affects the flavor.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.162
They're the most
street-food-looking ones.

13:50.196 --> 13:51.831
- Absolutely.
Yeah, that does it.
- Yeah, it does.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.137
Tough challenge.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.873
The first person safe,

14:00.907 --> 14:02.709
heading straight
into the top four

14:02.742 --> 14:04.877
of the biggest culinary
competition

14:04.911 --> 14:07.814
anywhere in the world,

14:07.847 --> 14:09.782
that person is...

14:12.752 --> 14:15.087
...Gerron.
Congratulations.

14:15.121 --> 14:16.889
Yes!

14:16.923 --> 14:21.260
Joe, AarÃ³n, and myself thought
it was cooked beautifully,

14:21.293 --> 14:22.729
and it was bountiful.

14:22.762 --> 14:25.665
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.435
The second home cook
that is safe from elimination...

14:30.770 --> 14:32.705
...that home cook is...

14:32.739 --> 14:35.207
Congrats...

14:42.715 --> 14:45.217
The second home cook
that is safe from elimination...

14:46.786 --> 14:49.722
...and from this challenge
upcoming is...

14:53.460 --> 14:55.895
- ...Cesar.
- Thank you.

14:55.928 --> 14:58.130
You cooked everything evenly,

14:58.164 --> 15:00.967
properly, and seasoned it
to perfection.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.235
- Thank you, Chef.
- So, off you go.

15:03.269 --> 15:05.905
Gerron and, of course, Cesar.

15:05.938 --> 15:07.440
Thank you, Chefs.

15:07.474 --> 15:09.809
I'm excited I was able to lift
the pressure

15:09.842 --> 15:12.244
of elimination
so early on tonight.

15:12.278 --> 15:14.647
This dream,
it's becoming a fairytale

15:14.681 --> 15:16.949
that I hope the ending is
happily ever after,

15:16.983 --> 15:20.787
but right now I'm gonna enjoy
being top four.

15:20.820 --> 15:22.922
Joe:
Unfortunately for you three,

15:22.955 --> 15:26.325
you are all in the apron
of Chef Gordon Ramsay.

15:26.358 --> 15:29.462
So, no matter
what happens tonight,

15:29.496 --> 15:30.930
he'll be losing one home cook.

15:30.963 --> 15:34.000
You three will now face
another challenge.

15:34.033 --> 15:36.135
Please, come with me.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.774
For your second beef challenge

15:41.808 --> 15:45.011
you'll be tackling one
of my most favorite things
to cook and to eat.

15:45.044 --> 15:48.781
This dish,
it requires a deft hand,

15:48.815 --> 15:51.818
and a perfect cook.

15:51.851 --> 15:55.822
Meatballs in a beautiful
marinara sauce.

15:55.855 --> 15:58.124
Soft pillows of deliciously
seasoned beef

15:58.157 --> 16:02.662
with that perfect marinara,
glistening light and pink.

16:02.695 --> 16:05.164
You three have to make
impeccable meatballs,

16:05.197 --> 16:08.601
or your MasterChef dreams
could end here tonight.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.670
Please head to your stations.

16:10.703 --> 16:12.371
Ashley:
I normally make meatballs
with my mom,

16:12.404 --> 16:15.041
so I'm familiar with the steps
to make them.

16:15.074 --> 16:18.778
However, they normally
sit in sauce

16:18.811 --> 16:21.714
for at least two hours at home.

16:21.748 --> 16:25.685
So this is going to be
a hell of a challenge.

16:25.718 --> 16:28.688
Now, your second attempt
to get up to the safety
of that balcony.

16:28.721 --> 16:34.661
You'll have 30 minutes to make
us a plate of perfect meatballs.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.696
At your stations you'll have
everything that you need

16:36.729 --> 16:40.332
to make some delicious
meatballs in marinara sauce.

16:40.366 --> 16:42.368
Your 30 minutes starts...

16:43.369 --> 16:44.871
...now.

16:48.107 --> 16:50.543
You know, meatballs are
such a popular food.

16:50.577 --> 16:54.346
Doesn't cost much to make, and
quite frankly, it's delicious.

16:54.380 --> 16:56.015
A to Z of
a perfect meatball, Joe.

16:56.048 --> 16:58.585
Gotta get the mix right.
The meat has to be ground right,

16:58.618 --> 17:01.688
the right blend of beef
and whatever else
you wanna add to it.

17:01.721 --> 17:05.224
Then bread crumbs,
milk, parsley,

17:05.257 --> 17:07.927
all important, but you have
to have the egg component right.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.328
Yeah.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.831
Looks like Ashley's just
gonna do the yolk.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.200
You wanna keep it light
and fluffy.

17:14.233 --> 17:17.336
Those bread crumbs,
you want them to create space,

17:17.369 --> 17:19.071
so working the bread
too much as well

17:19.105 --> 17:21.007
can also make the meatball
very, very hard.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.942
Gordon:
Down to 20 minutes.

17:22.975 --> 17:25.044
You've got to speed up,
all three of you.

17:25.077 --> 17:26.846
Come on, guys.

17:26.879 --> 17:30.717
So Ashley is putting milk
into her toasted bread crumbs.

17:30.750 --> 17:31.718
- Joe: That's good.
- AarÃ³n: Yeah.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.686
- She's focused.
- Yeah.

17:33.720 --> 17:37.123
Joe:
Bowen is rolling the meatballs
in the bread crumbs.

17:37.156 --> 17:38.557
That must be
a Chinese technique.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.927
Oh.
I don't know about that.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.630
Gerron: ( whispers )
Oh, Bowen, no.

17:43.663 --> 17:46.733
You have to panfry them,
lightly, not too hot.

17:46.766 --> 17:49.068
You don't wanna burn the
outside, keep the inside raw,

17:49.101 --> 17:50.302
and then you wanna cook them
in a tomato sauce.

17:50.336 --> 17:51.904
That's slow and low,

17:51.938 --> 17:52.972
but it comes out great
if you do it right.

17:53.005 --> 17:55.107
Those look good, Sam.

17:55.141 --> 17:58.577
Just coming up
to 15 minutes to go.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.579
Ashley's the only one
testing it.

18:00.613 --> 18:01.948
That's smart.

18:01.981 --> 18:03.916
All right, Ashley,
time is of the essence.

18:03.950 --> 18:05.317
- Yes, Chef.
- You need to get
these meatballs in.

18:05.351 --> 18:06.919
At this point
with 15 minutes left,

18:06.953 --> 18:08.587
I might even make them
a little bit smaller.

18:08.621 --> 18:09.756
- Heard.
- Just to get 'em cooked
in time.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.590
Have you made meatballs before?

18:11.624 --> 18:13.893
- I have made meatballs before.
- Putting a lot of bread crumbs.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.728
They look pretty white
and chewy.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.263
That's an interesting strategy,

18:17.296 --> 18:18.998
but you've got to get them
cooking now,

18:19.031 --> 18:21.167
- because your time
is running out.
- Heard.

18:21.200 --> 18:24.771
Ashley's gonna turn
into the Mad Scientist
in about four minutes.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.639
- Meatballs.
- Yes.

18:26.673 --> 18:29.508
- So you covered them
with bread crumbs.
- Yes.

18:29.541 --> 18:32.278
- And you're cooking them
with herbs and garlic.
- Yes.

18:32.311 --> 18:35.281
That's a very, very
nontraditional technique
you're doing here.

18:35.314 --> 18:37.784
Sometimes they say, Bowen,
that you don't listen.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.752
I'm not telling you
what to do.

18:39.786 --> 18:40.987
I'm just saying that sometimes
maybe you should listen more

18:41.020 --> 18:43.155
- and think less.
- Okay, sure.

18:43.189 --> 18:45.591
That's a dangerous thing
to do right now,
'cause it's replication.

18:45.624 --> 18:48.961
This is where a standard
meatball cook should
look like to knock off.

18:48.995 --> 18:52.665
Make sure you get enough sauce
in that pan so they submerge.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.801
- You've obviously made
meatballs before.
- I have.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.102
- I've made them--
- What was in your mix?

18:56.135 --> 18:59.005
I've got ground beef and--

18:59.038 --> 19:01.173
- Are you sure
you want to do that?
- No.

19:01.207 --> 19:03.042
- I meant to put them in here.
- Okay, just leave them.

19:03.075 --> 19:05.177
- What are you doing?
- I'm putting them in the oven,

19:05.211 --> 19:07.346
but I'd like them
to be in the sauce.

19:09.648 --> 19:11.984
- Why isn't she finishing
on the stove?
- I don't know.

19:12.018 --> 19:14.020
- Oven open.
- She's gonna put it
in the oven.

19:16.055 --> 19:17.289
What's happening?

19:17.323 --> 19:18.891
I don't really understand.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.993
Samantha was frying
the meatballs,

19:21.027 --> 19:22.829
and then she took some
tomato sauce and put it
in the frying pan,

19:22.862 --> 19:24.997
and then she put the meatballs
into the oven.

19:25.031 --> 19:27.299
- They'll get hard.
- Hard and raw in the middle.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.068
( whispers )
Okay, that's it.

19:29.101 --> 19:32.338
Ashley just put her meatballs in
the pan with ten minutes to go.

19:32.371 --> 19:34.340
I don't know if she'll
get them cooked in time.

19:34.373 --> 19:35.842
- Gordon: Wow.
- She's had time
management issues

19:35.875 --> 19:37.509
throughout this competition.

19:37.543 --> 19:39.879
It's on high.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.313
Joe:
Bowen has breaded
the meatballs,

19:41.347 --> 19:42.982
so they're like
meatball cutlets.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.583
- AarÃ³n: Mm-hmm.
- Bowen's gone rogue again.

19:44.616 --> 19:46.152
I mean, that is gonna be
that guy's downfall.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.154
It's funny how these
challenges seem easy,

19:48.187 --> 19:50.890
- but they're really
are difficult.
- They are.

19:50.923 --> 19:53.592
That's a nice one right there.

19:53.625 --> 19:54.861
Gordon:
Eight minutes to go.

19:57.396 --> 19:59.065
- Bowen's throwing his away.
- What's he doing?

19:59.098 --> 20:00.699
- He's throwing his away.
- Throwing his away?

20:00.733 --> 20:03.402
What have you done?
Have you thrown them away?

20:03.435 --> 20:05.404
- Yes.
- Oh, my Lord.

20:05.437 --> 20:08.440
Gordon:
What's he doing now?
He's making more.

20:08.474 --> 20:10.209
- No.
- Gordon: What have you done?

20:10.242 --> 20:13.345
I-- I have three
without the bread crumbs.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.514
He's trying to correct
his lack of listening

20:15.547 --> 20:18.751
with less than ten minutes left
in an elimination skill test.

20:18.785 --> 20:20.652
Are you kidding me?

20:21.653 --> 20:23.122
AarÃ³n:
Come on, guys.

20:23.155 --> 20:25.057
One perfect dish of meatballs

20:25.091 --> 20:28.227
to gain access to the safety
of the balcony.

20:28.260 --> 20:30.196
Uh, I need like 30 more seconds.

20:30.229 --> 20:33.032
Keep them in that sauce
for as long as possible.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.467
It's looking... perfect.

20:35.501 --> 20:37.804
Last minute, please.
Come on.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.906
Nice smell to it, too.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.908
- Gordon: Sam's are out.
- AarÃ³n: Okay.

20:41.941 --> 20:43.475
Ashley's are out.

20:43.509 --> 20:44.743
They look nice.

20:44.777 --> 20:47.914
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

20:47.947 --> 20:51.750
six, five, four, three,

20:51.784 --> 20:54.620
- two, one.
- Gordon: And stop. Well done.

20:58.290 --> 21:00.092
Please,
bring up your dishes.

21:07.033 --> 21:12.004
It's time to find out whose
meatballs are MasterChef worthy,

21:12.038 --> 21:16.142
and which two home cooks
will immediately face

21:16.175 --> 21:18.677
one more final battle.

21:20.546 --> 21:24.283
- First up, Samantha.
- Chef.

21:24.316 --> 21:27.086
The ratio of beef to pork
this evening was what?

21:27.119 --> 21:29.621
60 beef, 40 pork.

21:29.655 --> 21:31.257
You did a very bizarre thing.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.625
- You put the frying pan
into the oven. Why?
- Yeah.

21:33.659 --> 21:35.995
Well, I wanted a more gentle
cook on the meatballs

21:36.028 --> 21:38.197
after I got that sear
on them.

21:38.230 --> 21:41.300
- They need to submerge
themselves in the sauce.
- Right. Okay.

21:41.333 --> 21:43.635
360.
So they cook evenly.

21:43.669 --> 21:45.771
- Yeah.
- So, potentially,

21:45.804 --> 21:49.141
they could be undercooked
in the center.

21:49.175 --> 21:51.177
Let's have a look inside.

21:54.346 --> 21:55.347
God.

22:01.353 --> 22:03.055
Gordon:
So, Samantha,

22:03.089 --> 22:06.358
potentially they could be
undercooked in the center.

22:09.061 --> 22:11.597
Let's have a look inside.

22:15.534 --> 22:16.835
God.

22:16.869 --> 22:19.671
Yes, that's not cooked
in there.

22:21.840 --> 22:25.044
Pink pork is a no-go,

22:25.077 --> 22:28.547
so I'm gonna have to eat
around that for obvious reasons.

22:28.580 --> 22:30.716
How many times have
you made meatballs?

22:30.749 --> 22:32.218
I mean, just a few.

22:32.251 --> 22:33.685
A couple times
for my dad.

22:36.222 --> 22:39.658
Samantha,
they're under-seasoned,

22:39.691 --> 22:42.228
and then they need to be
submerged in that sauce

22:42.261 --> 22:43.762
to cook the center.

22:46.298 --> 22:48.700
Is the pressure
getting to you?

22:48.734 --> 22:50.202
I didn't think it was.

22:50.236 --> 22:52.071
I'm really disappointed
in this.

22:52.104 --> 22:56.208
You know, having three
of my mentees in front of me,

22:56.242 --> 22:58.010
it's painful,

22:58.044 --> 23:00.046
'cause right now I'd much
rather have two of you

23:00.079 --> 23:02.281
up to the safety
of the balcony.

23:02.314 --> 23:05.051
But that is not
a safety net, is it?

23:05.084 --> 23:06.752
- No.
- That's a danger zone.

23:10.156 --> 23:12.891
( whispers )
That's rough.

23:12.925 --> 23:16.028
- Okay, Bowen.
- Hi, Joe.

23:16.062 --> 23:19.698
Now I saw you doing something
very, very unorthodox.

23:19.731 --> 23:23.035
You were coating the meatballs
in bread crumbs

23:23.069 --> 23:24.736
before you fried them
in the pan.

23:24.770 --> 23:26.738
It's Chinese thing, so--

23:26.772 --> 23:29.741
At no point did I say
cover them in bread crumbs

23:29.775 --> 23:32.611
into a meatball cutlet.

23:32.644 --> 23:34.580
When you tell me
like it's not right,

23:34.613 --> 23:38.084
I made a couple adjustments
with the bread crumb.

23:38.117 --> 23:40.052
And how much bread crumbs
did you use?

23:40.086 --> 23:41.620
Uh...

23:41.653 --> 23:42.821
On the interior?

23:42.854 --> 23:44.056
Any?

23:44.090 --> 23:46.225
Uh...

23:46.258 --> 23:48.294
That is a massive mistake.

23:48.327 --> 23:50.062
Yeah.

23:50.096 --> 23:53.899
The bread in the meat mix is
what gives it the lightness.

23:53.932 --> 23:55.334
This is hard and dense.

23:58.804 --> 24:00.339
They are in fact
seasoned well.

24:00.372 --> 24:02.141
The tomato sauce is
actually quite good.

24:02.174 --> 24:03.509
I thought it was gonna
be much worse.

24:03.542 --> 24:04.943
Somehow it came out okay.

24:04.977 --> 24:07.646
But, Bowen, you gotta
follow the rules.

24:07.679 --> 24:09.681
You can't do whatever you want
at this point in the game.

24:09.715 --> 24:11.150
- Okay?
- Yes, Joe.

24:12.651 --> 24:14.753
( whispers )
This is crazy.

24:14.786 --> 24:17.189
- Ashley.
- Hi, Chef.

24:17.223 --> 24:19.458
How did that meatball
challenge go for you?

24:19.491 --> 24:21.193
Time was getting past me,

24:21.227 --> 24:25.164
but I made sure that the heat
stayed within the meatballs.

24:25.197 --> 24:28.167
I'm slightly worried
that there wasn't enough time

24:28.200 --> 24:30.702
for that process to unfold.

24:30.736 --> 24:32.471
Visually, they're
a little bit uneven

24:32.504 --> 24:33.972
as far as the shape,

24:34.006 --> 24:37.276
but they are cooked through,
which is nice.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.845
I love the amount of herbs
that you put in there.

24:43.149 --> 24:47.319
The flavor of these meatballs
is so divine.

24:47.353 --> 24:50.322
You toasted the bread crumbs
and you added a little bit
of dairy to that.

24:50.356 --> 24:54.026
It made this beautiful paste
that you can taste all
throughout the meatballs.

24:54.060 --> 24:58.030
All this is missing is
a more consistent roll
and more sauce.

24:58.064 --> 25:01.200
Give me more, more, more, 'cause
this is meatballs and marinara,

25:01.233 --> 25:02.668
not a sparse amount of it.

25:04.270 --> 25:06.705
- ( whispers ) It's a close one.
- ( whispers ) I know.

25:06.738 --> 25:08.807
The meatball was
delicious.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.842
- Where was the sauce?
- AarÃ³n: Yeah.

25:10.876 --> 25:12.644
Bowen,
you had top-notch sauce,

25:12.678 --> 25:14.546
- Yeah?
- but the meatballs,
they were hard.

25:14.580 --> 25:16.782
- Well, Samantha's
were raw, right?
- Yeah.

25:20.052 --> 25:23.655
So, first of all,
Samantha, you know

25:23.689 --> 25:25.691
- there's no such thing
as medium rare pork.
- No.

25:25.724 --> 25:28.227
You made a technical error.

25:28.260 --> 25:31.930
So unfortunately,
you will be going head-to-head

25:31.963 --> 25:35.334
to keep your position
in the MasterChef kitchen.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.569
That leaves Bowen
and Ashley,

25:37.603 --> 25:41.707
two meatball dishes
with certain attributes
and also defects.

25:41.740 --> 25:45.177
The person joining
Cesar and Gerron

25:45.211 --> 25:48.147
in the balcony is...

25:51.950 --> 25:54.052
...Ashley.

25:54.086 --> 25:56.054
Congratulations.

25:56.088 --> 25:58.724
- Your meatballs were excellent.
- Thank you.

25:58.757 --> 26:01.059
Top four. Yes!

26:01.093 --> 26:02.594
Well, congratulations.

26:02.628 --> 26:04.563
Get on up
to the balcony.

26:04.596 --> 26:07.699
I am relieved,
because it was this close.

26:07.733 --> 26:10.569
I didn't want to disappoint
Gordon again.

26:10.602 --> 26:12.804
And by the grace
of these meatballs,

26:12.838 --> 26:17.143
I am going up to this balcony
safe from elimination.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.948
Unfortunately,
you two are not safe,

26:22.981 --> 26:27.018
and one of you will go home
tonight.

26:28.287 --> 26:31.022
Please, both of you, follow us.

26:39.798 --> 26:42.234
For your final beef battle,

26:42.268 --> 26:45.604
you'll be making
a MasterChef classic.

26:45.637 --> 26:51.577
It is the most tender cut
and expensive on the cow.

26:51.610 --> 26:56.315
It can only be an incredible,
temperamental...

27:04.156 --> 27:06.158
Bowen, Samantha,
for your final beef battle,

27:06.192 --> 27:08.694
you'll be making
a "MasterChef" classic.

27:10.028 --> 27:11.830
Filet mignon.

27:13.499 --> 27:16.302
- The chef's dream.
- It's beautiful.

27:16.335 --> 27:19.505
And we thought
one isn't just enough,

27:19.538 --> 27:22.508
so tonight you'll be cooking

27:22.541 --> 27:24.710
three filet mignons.

27:24.743 --> 27:26.645
( whispers )
Oh.

27:26.678 --> 27:30.782
This is a test
to see if you can nail

27:30.816 --> 27:34.553
three completely different
temperatures.

27:34.586 --> 27:36.154
( whispers )
That's crazy.

27:36.188 --> 27:40.226
First, we have the perfect
well done filet.

27:41.593 --> 27:42.994
Look.

27:43.028 --> 27:46.398
Evenly colored,
but moist in the center,

27:46.432 --> 27:48.667
and not an ounce
of blood anywhere.

27:48.700 --> 27:54.005
Next, a medium filet mignon.

27:54.039 --> 27:56.141
Just slightly pink
in the middle,

27:56.174 --> 27:59.845
and beautifully moist
throughout.

27:59.878 --> 28:03.215
The final temperature tonight
is a rare filet mignon.

28:06.685 --> 28:09.154
Pink from top to bottom.

28:09.187 --> 28:11.723
Juicy, tender, beautiful.

28:11.757 --> 28:16.928
Now, you have to nail
the filet mignon three ways,

28:16.962 --> 28:20.098
if you want to keep
your MasterChef dream
alive tonight.

28:20.131 --> 28:22.167
- Understood?
- Both: Yes, Chef.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.570
Both of you, please,
head to your stations.

28:28.807 --> 28:30.942
Three filets,
three different temperatures.

28:30.976 --> 28:33.211
This one's almost impossible,
because it's like three darts

28:33.245 --> 28:35.714
and only one chance
to hit the bull's-eye

28:35.747 --> 28:37.883
and if you don't, game's over.

28:37.916 --> 28:40.218
On your stations you'll find
everything that you need

28:40.252 --> 28:45.757
to cook us three
perfectly cooked filet mignons.

28:45.791 --> 28:47.926
You'll have just 30 minutes.

28:47.959 --> 28:49.561
When time is up,

28:49.595 --> 28:52.898
all three have to be up here
on the front station.

28:52.931 --> 28:54.199
Is everyone ready?

28:54.232 --> 28:55.734
Both:
Yes, Chef.

28:55.767 --> 28:58.570
Your 30 minutes...

28:58.604 --> 28:59.771
starts...

29:02.341 --> 29:05.110
- ...now.
- Home cooks: Come on, guys!

29:05.143 --> 29:08.647
( home cooks cheering )

29:08.680 --> 29:11.883
I need to put every last bit

29:11.917 --> 29:13.652
of energy that I have
into this cook,

29:13.685 --> 29:16.722
because I gave up school
to win this competition,

29:16.755 --> 29:18.256
and if I go home now,

29:18.290 --> 29:20.592
that means giving up school
was pointless.

29:20.626 --> 29:22.794
Bowen:
It's really hard for me,

29:22.828 --> 29:25.797
because the only way
I like my steak is well done.

29:25.831 --> 29:27.766
But the only thing
I can do is focus,

29:27.799 --> 29:31.770
because either I'm going
to the semifinal or going home.

29:31.803 --> 29:34.072
Everything is on the line.

29:34.105 --> 29:36.775
Gordon, why filet mignon?

29:36.808 --> 29:38.977
Joe, it shows a great
level of skill

29:39.010 --> 29:41.613
to cook and nail
those three temperatures.

29:41.647 --> 29:43.949
- Y'all, this is crazy.
This is crazy.
- Mm-hmm.

29:43.982 --> 29:47.619
Gordon, both of these home cooks
cooking for their lives tonight

29:47.653 --> 29:48.920
are wearing your aprons.

29:48.954 --> 29:50.356
We're asking them

29:50.389 --> 29:53.291
to do a well-done filet
in a pan tonight.

29:53.325 --> 29:55.293
- How difficult is that?
- The secret is in a great sear.

29:55.327 --> 29:59.097
Maintain that heat in the pan,
add a couple of ladles of stock,

29:59.130 --> 30:00.999
then it goes into the oven.

30:01.032 --> 30:02.834
And as it cooks in the oven,
it absorbs the stock.

30:02.868 --> 30:04.269
- Yup.
- It stays juicy,

30:04.302 --> 30:05.971
but, more importantly,
it's not dry.

30:10.008 --> 30:12.143
Joe:
So after well done is medium.

30:12.177 --> 30:15.180
A medium is a perfect balance
of cooked through

30:15.213 --> 30:17.115
with a little kiss of pink
on the middle.

30:17.148 --> 30:20.819
So the secret is to make sure
you baste it.

30:20.852 --> 30:25.657
And also, a big thing here
is searing all sides of
the filet mignon.

30:25.691 --> 30:28.660
Just over 21 minutes to go.

30:28.694 --> 30:30.629
- Cesar: Come on, guys.
Good job.
- Gerron: Come on, guys.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.631
- Good job.
- Keep pushing.

30:32.664 --> 30:35.901
Young man, you're minutes away
from getting to the top four.

30:35.934 --> 30:38.336
- What's the most difficult
for you to nail?
- The medium.

30:38.370 --> 30:41.873
Because I never cook
medium before.

30:41.907 --> 30:43.341
Are you finishing
the well done in the oven

30:43.375 --> 30:45.176
or you keeping it
on top of the stove?

30:45.210 --> 30:48.814
I'm gonna finish that
and then in the oven
for two minutes,

30:48.847 --> 30:51.182
and then I do rest,
the rest on pan.

30:51.216 --> 30:52.884
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

30:52.918 --> 30:54.720
Because I'm just
trying to focus.

30:54.753 --> 30:57.689
I don't want to stop
my dream right here,

30:57.723 --> 31:00.258
because I all the way from China
and I have a passion.

31:00.291 --> 31:02.227
- I get that. Good luck.
- Thank you, Chef.

31:04.896 --> 31:07.165
- Right, young lady.
- Chef.

31:07.198 --> 31:09.034
How you feeling right now?

31:09.067 --> 31:10.602
Um, I'm feeling okay.
I've never cooked
a well done steak.

31:10.636 --> 31:12.538
Have you cooked
a medium before?

31:12.571 --> 31:14.005
- I have cooked medium
and I have cooked rare.
- Right.

31:14.039 --> 31:15.741
Which one you most
worried about?

31:15.774 --> 31:17.543
The well done,
because it's hard
to cook it well done,

31:17.576 --> 31:18.910
and keep it moist.

31:18.944 --> 31:20.245
You need to focus.

31:20.278 --> 31:21.713
- Okay?
- Yes, Chef.

31:21.747 --> 31:24.115
- Step back.
- Whoo!

31:24.149 --> 31:26.217
( whispers )
Oh, Sam.

31:26.251 --> 31:29.020
That's why I said step back.
Okay, look at me.

31:29.054 --> 31:31.022
- You've got this.
Get it in the oven.
- Yes, Chef.

31:31.056 --> 31:33.759
- Let's go.
- Thank you, Chef.

31:33.792 --> 31:35.126
Oven open.

31:35.160 --> 31:36.762
All right,
here she goes.

31:40.932 --> 31:43.702
- So how's it going?
- Samantha looks more in control
than anybody.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.871
- She's also using
the beef stock.
- That's smart.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.573
- Bowen-- Bowen's pans
are way too hot.
- Too hot.

31:47.606 --> 31:50.075
So that sear on the outside is
turning into a crust.

31:50.108 --> 31:52.243
So whenever we're gonna be
slicing that it's gonna be dry.

31:52.277 --> 31:53.979
The good thing about Bowen's
is that he's got the thyme

31:54.012 --> 31:55.714
and the garlic in there
and he's basting.

31:55.747 --> 31:58.116
We're coming down
to seven minutes remaining.

31:58.149 --> 31:59.651
- Heard, Chef. Thank you.
- Bowen: Heard, Chef.

32:01.820 --> 32:05.123
Bowen started his rare
way too early, guys.

32:05.156 --> 32:08.293
To nail a rare steak,
you sear it, literally,
with five minutes to go.

32:08.326 --> 32:11.296
Two minutes each side
and one minute rest.

32:11.329 --> 32:13.599
Sam's got her rare on there.

32:13.632 --> 32:15.266
Five minutes remaining.

32:15.300 --> 32:17.803
- Gordon: Yes?
- Both: Yes, Chef.

32:17.836 --> 32:20.606
- Oven open.
- Joe: So Samantha is
second-guessing her medium

32:20.639 --> 32:22.608
and she took it off the rack
and put it in the oven.

32:22.641 --> 32:25.176
No! You never stick a medium
steak in the oven.

32:28.113 --> 32:30.148
He better be praying
right now.

32:32.317 --> 32:33.919
Joe:
Uh-oh! Bowen's gonna put
his steak back.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.254
AarÃ³n:
He's putting--
Oh, my God!

32:36.287 --> 32:39.324
- What's he doing?
- He might be ruining a perfect
medium steak right now.

32:40.859 --> 32:43.128
Gordon:
30 seconds to go.

32:43.161 --> 32:45.296
I wouldn't wanna be
in their shoes right now.

32:45.330 --> 32:47.599
- Gerron: It's tough.
- Gordon: I need them down
in the front.

32:47.633 --> 32:49.668
Hurry, hurry, guys.
Hurry.

32:50.669 --> 32:53.138
Ten, nine, eight,

32:53.171 --> 32:55.941
seven, six, five,

32:55.974 --> 32:58.710
four, three, two,

32:58.744 --> 33:00.846
one, and stop.

33:00.879 --> 33:03.148
- ( applause )
- Gerron: Wow.

33:03.181 --> 33:04.616
Oh, man.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.985
Well done, Bowen.
Well done, Samantha.

33:07.018 --> 33:11.557
So, it all comes down
to these three filet mignons.

33:11.590 --> 33:14.726
We're going to begin
with the well done.

33:14.760 --> 33:17.328
- Bowen.
- Yes, Chef.

33:17.362 --> 33:18.730
How long was it in the pan?

33:18.764 --> 33:21.833
On each side
around five minutes,

33:21.867 --> 33:24.135
and I let it rest.

33:24.169 --> 33:26.738
Your future
in this competition

33:26.772 --> 33:32.310
depends on the temperature
of these three steaks.

33:32.343 --> 33:37.082
This well done steak
could be worth a quarter
of a million dollars.

33:37.115 --> 33:38.717
( sighs )

33:38.750 --> 33:40.552
What is it gonna look like
inside?

33:40.586 --> 33:44.723
It's supposed to look like
little pink, but no blood.

33:44.756 --> 33:46.858
Let's see.

33:59.771 --> 34:02.774
Bowen,
this well done steak,

34:02.808 --> 34:04.409
what is it gonna look like
inside?

34:04.442 --> 34:08.046
It's supposed to look like
little pink, but no blood.

34:16.121 --> 34:17.689
( whispers )
No.

34:17.723 --> 34:19.257
( sighs )

34:29.935 --> 34:31.937
Oh, my God.

34:31.970 --> 34:34.572
- Samantha.
- Yes, Chef.

34:34.606 --> 34:37.375
How confident are you
about the cook
on that steak?

34:37.408 --> 34:39.077
75%.

34:39.110 --> 34:41.112
Let's find out.

34:48.987 --> 34:51.589
- Did you introduce beef stock?
- I did a little bit,

34:51.623 --> 34:55.026
about a centimeter
of beef stock.

35:01.800 --> 35:05.804
- Start with Bowen.
- It is medium rare.

35:05.837 --> 35:08.006
But she nailed
the temperature perfectly.

35:08.039 --> 35:09.941
- It's nailed?
- Absolutely.

35:14.279 --> 35:18.283
Okay, Bowen and Samantha,
I like my steak medium.

35:21.653 --> 35:24.956
Bowen,
how did you cook it?

35:24.990 --> 35:28.794
I sear them four minutes
on each side.

35:28.827 --> 35:30.161
And what should it look inside?

35:30.195 --> 35:32.864
Pink, no red.

35:49.981 --> 35:51.616
Samantha.

35:51.649 --> 35:53.284
When I cut this open,
what should it look like?

35:53.318 --> 35:54.920
A very light pink.

35:58.589 --> 36:01.026
Let's see.

36:10.068 --> 36:11.703
( whispers )
That looks under.

36:13.038 --> 36:15.640
I think we have two versions
of medium rare.

36:15.673 --> 36:17.008
You have a medium rare
to medium,

36:17.042 --> 36:18.609
and you have a medium rare
to rare.

36:22.881 --> 36:26.985
Bowen, how confident are you
that it's rare?

36:27.018 --> 36:28.219
80%.

36:40.866 --> 36:42.267
Let's taste it.

36:42.300 --> 36:43.735
What'd you season it with?

36:43.769 --> 36:46.371
Salt and pepper,
garlic, thyme baste.

36:52.744 --> 36:54.679
( whispers )
She gotta get it right.

36:54.712 --> 36:57.282
Samantha,
let's get in there.

36:57.315 --> 36:59.717
- What'd you season it with?
- Salt, pepper,

36:59.751 --> 37:03.922
and then I basted with butter,
thyme, and crushed garlic.

37:20.271 --> 37:22.307
( whispers )
This is crazy.

37:22.340 --> 37:25.610
- I'm glad I'm not
in their shoes.
- No. Oh, my God.

37:25.643 --> 37:28.046
They're both cooked beautifully,

37:28.079 --> 37:30.648
- but there's one there that's
got the seasoning spot-on.
- Wow.

37:31.817 --> 37:33.985
Yes, right.

37:34.019 --> 37:35.686
Samantha and Bowen,

37:36.955 --> 37:38.089
please come around
to the front.

37:39.624 --> 37:41.259
I'm so nervous.

37:41.292 --> 37:43.929
It could be me going home.

37:43.962 --> 37:48.967
This decision is decide
my MasterChef dream.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.170
There's only one spot left
on that balcony,

37:52.203 --> 37:55.907
and one of you will be taking
the long road home.

37:55.941 --> 38:01.612
We asked for filet mignon
well done, medium, and rare.

38:01.646 --> 38:05.116
Gordon, you were judging
the rare.

38:05.150 --> 38:08.153
Your assessment, please.

38:08.186 --> 38:11.622
Bowen and Samantha,
temperature nailed.
Let's get that right.

38:11.656 --> 38:15.126
But one did have an advantage
over the flavor,

38:15.160 --> 38:17.662
and that steak
belonged to...

38:21.699 --> 38:23.668
...Bowen.

38:23.701 --> 38:25.136
Joe:
Wow.

38:25.170 --> 38:27.138
Which brings me
to you, AarÃ³n.

38:27.172 --> 38:32.343
Who absolutely nailed
the well done temperature?

38:33.678 --> 38:36.314
That home cook is...

38:39.717 --> 38:42.020
- ...Samantha.
- Gordon: Wow.

38:42.053 --> 38:43.889
( whispers )
Yeah.

38:43.922 --> 38:49.827
Bowen, you were way off
on the temperature of well done.

38:51.729 --> 38:54.199
So that means it comes down

38:54.232 --> 38:59.270
to who absolutely nailed
the medium filet.

39:01.206 --> 39:03.674
So, it was a temperature
challenge,

39:03.708 --> 39:05.843
and one of the two steaks
was much closer

39:05.877 --> 39:08.646
to being a medium
than the other.

39:08.679 --> 39:11.382
That filet was cooked by...

39:14.052 --> 39:15.720
...Samantha.

39:20.391 --> 39:21.692
Congratulations.

39:21.726 --> 39:23.694
Please, head up to the balcony.

39:33.404 --> 39:37.943
Bowen, tonight the MasterChef
door may have closed,

39:37.976 --> 39:42.413
but I would love to have you
in my brigade

39:42.447 --> 39:45.050
anywhere in the world.

39:45.083 --> 39:46.684
- Thank you, Chef.
- That's what you mean to me.

39:46.717 --> 39:48.053
You must've enjoyed yourself.

39:48.086 --> 39:52.123
Like the time I
in the MasterChef kitchen,

39:52.157 --> 39:55.626
it's the best moment in my life.

39:55.660 --> 39:57.528
My dream never stop.

39:57.562 --> 40:00.631
I go back home,
work really hard,

40:00.665 --> 40:03.801
and then hope someday
to open our restaurant.

40:03.834 --> 40:06.571
This kitchen is not gonna
be as bright without you,
you know that.

40:06.604 --> 40:08.473
( voice breaking )
Yes, Chef.

40:08.506 --> 40:10.475
Come up and say goodbye, please.

40:10.508 --> 40:12.377
I hate to say goodbye,
but I have to say goodbye.

40:12.410 --> 40:13.979
Thank you, my friend.

40:14.012 --> 40:15.713
Good luck to you.
It's been a pleasure.

40:15.746 --> 40:18.716
You are a special young man,
all right? Keep at it.

40:18.749 --> 40:20.318
Oh, young man,
come here.

40:20.351 --> 40:23.921
Oh, Bowen.

40:23.955 --> 40:25.590
I didn't think
I'd be saying this,

40:25.623 --> 40:28.059
but would you be so kind
to put your apron on your bench,

40:28.093 --> 40:30.928
and have a safe trip home.

40:30.962 --> 40:32.330
- Thank you, Bowen.
- Thank you.

40:32.363 --> 40:33.764
- Good job.
- Bye, Bowen.

40:33.798 --> 40:37.402
I feeling not so well,

40:37.435 --> 40:39.670
but I'm definitely proud
of myself,

40:39.704 --> 40:42.607
and I feel like I make Gordon
to be proud.

40:42.640 --> 40:44.109
- Ashley: Bowen.
- Gerron: Love, Bowen.

40:44.142 --> 40:46.277
Ashley and Samantha:
You did it with love!

40:46.311 --> 40:49.981
"MasterChef" teach me how
to build up my confident

40:50.015 --> 40:51.949
to be more knowledgeable,

40:51.983 --> 40:55.120
and become a more better Bowen.

40:55.153 --> 40:57.022
I'm born to be a chef.

40:57.055 --> 41:01.026
So Bowen is big star
in the future.

41:09.167 --> 41:10.768
Narrator:
Next time...

41:10.801 --> 41:14.205
Tonight, you'll be cooking
for our mentors.

41:14.239 --> 41:15.806
...three culinary legends...

41:15.840 --> 41:17.608
AarÃ³n: Jonathan Waxman.

41:17.642 --> 41:18.943
Gordon: Daniel Boulud.

41:18.976 --> 41:21.146
And I'm lucky enough
to call her Mom,

41:21.179 --> 41:22.647
Lidia Bastianich.

41:22.680 --> 41:24.649
This is crazy!

41:24.682 --> 41:26.284
...take over the competition.

41:26.317 --> 41:28.953
Do not overcook
your proteins!

41:28.986 --> 41:30.655
Samantha: Lidia Bastianich?

41:30.688 --> 41:33.191
Our dishes better
be absolutely perfect.

41:33.224 --> 41:36.794
Narrator: The home cooks fight
for a spot in the final three,

41:36.827 --> 41:40.831
and a chance to become
America's next MasterChef.
