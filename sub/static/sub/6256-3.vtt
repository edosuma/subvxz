00:00.011 --> 00:02.662
I don't know, have you
seen <i> Planet of the Apes?</i>

00:02.663 --> 00:05.530
It's like the post-apocalyptic
future down here.

00:05.564 --> 00:07.265
Brenda, relax.

00:07.301 --> 00:09.501
The soup kitchen is
just on the next block.

00:09.536 --> 00:11.603
There have to be easier
ways to spice up

00:11.638 --> 00:12.971
a college
application.

00:13.006 --> 00:14.539
It's all about
community service.

00:14.574 --> 00:16.608
Colleges don't care about
test scores anymore.

00:16.643 --> 00:18.610
Couldn't we have picked
a less creepy community?

00:18.645 --> 00:19.911
Whoa, Brenda,

00:19.946 --> 00:21.179
do you see that?

00:21.214 --> 00:22.934
There's a guy over there
in the storm drain.

00:24.084 --> 00:26.017
He looks
stuck.

00:26.053 --> 00:27.419
Help me get this stuff
out of the way.

00:27.454 --> 00:28.653
Seriously?

00:28.689 --> 00:31.723
Do you want to go
to Harvard or not?

00:31.758 --> 00:33.458
Sir, are you okay?

00:33.493 --> 00:35.126
Does he look
okay, Brenda?

00:35.162 --> 00:36.361
(sighs)

00:36.396 --> 00:38.663
Sir, we're going
to get you out.

00:38.699 --> 00:40.398
Grab the other
side and pull.

00:40.434 --> 00:42.200
One...

00:42.235 --> 00:44.235
two... three!

00:47.007 --> 00:49.140
(screams)

00:50.410 --> 00:52.544
(chittering)

00:57.317 --> 00:58.750
You're right.

00:58.785 --> 01:00.552
This is going to
make an awesome

01:00.587 --> 01:02.387
college essay.

01:08.228 --> 01:10.261
How long have
you been up?

01:10.297 --> 01:11.730
Oh, not too long.

01:11.765 --> 01:13.665
I just wanted to read this
new piece on the Flyers.

01:13.700 --> 01:15.834
I'm telling you, Hextall's gonna win us
the Cup this year.

01:15.869 --> 01:17.435
You didn't sleep again, did you?

01:17.471 --> 01:18.803
I was, uh,
it was in and out.

01:18.839 --> 01:20.138
I was probably just, you know,

01:20.173 --> 01:21.773
getting used to
this new house and all.

01:21.808 --> 01:25.443
Booth, you haven't slept
well in a long time.

01:25.479 --> 01:27.479
I'm worried that
something is wrong.

01:27.514 --> 01:29.414
You were
falsely accused.

01:29.449 --> 01:31.182
You were
in prison.

01:31.218 --> 01:32.984
You've been through a lot.

01:33.019 --> 01:34.019
Well, so have you.

01:34.054 --> 01:35.387
Not as much as you.

01:35.422 --> 01:37.122
Sweets would say

01:37.157 --> 01:38.623
that you have
avoidance issues.

01:38.658 --> 01:40.125
Oh, avoidance issues. What?

01:40.160 --> 01:41.793
You're still
not trusting

01:41.828 --> 01:43.461
the people
you work with.

01:43.497 --> 01:44.863
I'm concerned you're not dealing

01:44.898 --> 01:46.564
with the trauma you suffered.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.633
Listen, Sweets has passed away,
okay? God bless his soul.

01:48.668 --> 01:50.034
And you know what?

01:50.070 --> 01:51.302
You don't even
believe in psychology.

01:51.338 --> 01:52.804
Right?

01:52.839 --> 01:54.105
You know
what, I...

01:54.141 --> 01:55.840
Let's not talk
about this now.

01:55.876 --> 01:57.742
Please?

01:57.778 --> 02:00.378
All right, look,
I'll sleep when I'm tired.

02:00.414 --> 02:02.447
But for now,
I'm gonna make you pancakes.

02:02.482 --> 02:04.616
I know you've
missed my pancakes.

02:04.651 --> 02:06.785
(phone ringing) Yes, you have.
Pancakes coming up.

02:06.820 --> 02:08.686
Booth...

02:08.722 --> 02:10.722
Yeah...
Right, right, okay.

02:10.757 --> 02:12.457
Ooh... on our way.
Sure.

02:12.492 --> 02:15.160
Well, it looks like someone
is sleeping the big sleep.

02:15.195 --> 02:16.895
So much for the pancakes.
They found a body

02:16.930 --> 02:18.663
under the bridge
in Garfield Heights.

02:18.698 --> 02:21.199
I'll get Christine
ready for day care.

02:21.234 --> 02:23.334
(indistinct radio chatter)

02:30.277 --> 02:32.577
SAROYAN: The victim was found by
a couple of high school kids

02:32.612 --> 02:34.078
who didn't realize
the guy was dead

02:34.114 --> 02:37.215
because weasels were
making the body move.

02:37.250 --> 02:38.730
BOOTH:
Whoa, they must've freaked out.

02:38.752 --> 02:40.218
SAROYAN:
Actually, one was pumped.

02:40.253 --> 02:41.886
Said something about it
being what she needed

02:41.922 --> 02:44.189
to get into Harvard?
These trusty hands are all yours.

02:44.224 --> 02:46.558
Put me to work. Aubrey, what are
you doing here?

02:46.593 --> 02:48.860
Well, you know, I was
in the neighborhood and I heard the call,

02:48.895 --> 02:50.829
so I sort of figured
I'd stop by--

02:50.864 --> 02:52.163
holy crap!

02:52.199 --> 02:54.866
(gagging):
Oh, man...

02:54.901 --> 02:56.100
Oh, my God.

02:56.136 --> 02:58.269
Where's the other half of him?

02:58.305 --> 03:00.465
That's the worst thing I've ever seen.
SAROYAN: Really?

03:00.474 --> 03:02.474
I'd only give this about a 7.5.

03:02.509 --> 03:03.942
I'd give this a six.

03:03.977 --> 03:05.343
You know, the floaters
are much worse.

03:05.378 --> 03:06.744
Yeah, well,
you know,

03:06.780 --> 03:08.346
give me a nice,
clean gunshot any day.

03:08.381 --> 03:10.048
It seems you're
not familiar with

03:10.083 --> 03:11.483
the explosive nature of a head wound.
AUBREY: Okay, okay,

03:11.518 --> 03:13.985
hazing the new guy.
It's really funny.

03:14.020 --> 03:15.854
So what the hell happened here?

03:15.889 --> 03:18.289
The victim got stuck in the
drain and animals ate the half

03:18.325 --> 03:19.557
they had access to.

03:19.593 --> 03:20.825
I could see how
he got stuck.

03:20.861 --> 03:22.060
He was obese.

03:22.095 --> 03:23.528
Well, half of
him still is obese.

03:23.563 --> 03:25.864
Blunt surface of
the orbital margins

03:25.899 --> 03:29.367
indicates the victim
is male, Caucasian.

03:29.402 --> 03:31.603
Well, the inside of the pants
confirms the male part.

03:31.638 --> 03:34.005
Ooh, wait a sec.
This is not an accident.

03:34.040 --> 03:35.907
Look at the bottom of his soles.
AUBREY: Totally clean.

03:35.942 --> 03:38.209
Didn't walk here on his own.
It's a body dump.

03:38.245 --> 03:40.745
Or an attempt at
one, at least.

03:40.780 --> 03:43.348
I found our ravenous little culprits!
AUBREY: Oh. Rats.

03:43.383 --> 03:45.617
Never been a fan.
HODGINS: Rats?

03:45.652 --> 03:47.151
Don't embarrass yourself,
Aubrey.

03:47.187 --> 03:48.419
These are stoats,

03:48.455 --> 03:50.021
aka short-tailed weasels.

03:50.056 --> 03:51.756
Anyone have
time of death for me?

03:51.791 --> 03:52.824
Uniformity
in scoring

03:52.859 --> 03:54.626
on the cortical
surface suggests

03:54.661 --> 03:55.960
the stoats are
the lone scavengers.

03:55.996 --> 03:57.328
HODGINS:
And given the level

03:57.364 --> 03:58.663
of predation,
I'd say three days.

03:58.698 --> 03:59.731
I'm gonna see what else

03:59.766 --> 04:00.965
I can find.
Three days.

04:01.001 --> 04:02.267
AUBREY:
His pants are pricey.

04:02.302 --> 04:03.502
This is high-quality
gabardine.

04:03.537 --> 04:04.969
Yeah.

04:05.005 --> 04:06.765
And his shoes are Italian.
Expensive leather.

04:06.773 --> 04:08.072
BOOTH: Well, look,
the big question is

04:08.108 --> 04:09.908
what was Daddy Warbucks
doing down here?

04:09.943 --> 04:11.609
Could've been
buying drugs.

04:11.645 --> 04:13.144
Wouldn't be the first time
in this neighborhood.

04:13.179 --> 04:15.446
HODGINS: Found it!
I found the stoats' den.

04:15.482 --> 04:17.180
And... (grunts)

04:17.216 --> 04:19.284
...it is filled with evidence.
BOOTH: Yeah, music to my ears.

04:19.319 --> 04:21.853
HODGINS: Yeah, no, lucky for us,
the stoat actually

04:21.887 --> 04:24.222
lines his den with
the remains of his prey.

04:24.257 --> 04:25.723
Is that his...?

04:25.759 --> 04:26.624
Hair? Yeah.

04:26.660 --> 04:27.592
And those are

04:27.627 --> 04:28.893
phalanges.

04:28.929 --> 04:30.361
SAROYAN:
And an eyeball.

04:30.397 --> 04:31.963
Oh, God, it's his tongue.

04:31.998 --> 04:34.265
Yes.
Very observant, Mr. Aubrey.

04:34.301 --> 04:35.934
AUBREY: Thank you.
Oh, man...

04:35.969 --> 04:37.201
there's one still inside.

04:37.237 --> 04:39.704
Oh, God... and he's eating...

04:39.739 --> 04:41.906
He's eating, oh, man.
HODGINS: Yeah.

04:41.942 --> 04:43.541
It's a fun job, right?

05:22.640 --> 05:24.980
On the lower thoracic
and lumbar vertebrae,

05:24.980 --> 05:27.080
I'm seeing numerous
osteophytes.

05:27.116 --> 05:31.017
A common skeletal injury
for the morbidly obese.

05:31.053 --> 05:32.486
Note the perimortem

05:32.521 --> 05:33.787
fractures to the nasal bones.

05:33.822 --> 05:34.955
And also

05:36.658 --> 05:38.325
the upper left

incisor.

05:39.695 --> 05:40.794
SAROYAN:
That would suggest a hard blow

05:40.829 --> 05:43.130
from a right-handed assailant.

05:43.165 --> 05:45.165
But not hard enough to be fatal.

05:47.169 --> 05:48.635
Before we continue,

05:48.670 --> 05:52.105
I would like to...
offer my condolences.

05:55.511 --> 05:57.644
Dr. Sweets was a good man.

05:57.679 --> 06:00.313
Yes, he was.

06:00.349 --> 06:02.549
He was a very good man.

06:02.584 --> 06:03.817
FUENTES: Colleagues can
be like family.

06:03.852 --> 06:05.452
I had an assistant
in Habana, and

06:05.487 --> 06:07.988
like Sweets,
he was like a brother.

06:08.023 --> 06:10.290
Guys, can we please not talk
about Sweets right now?

06:10.325 --> 06:12.125
If we do, we're
going to start crying

06:12.161 --> 06:13.321
and contaminate the evidence.

06:13.328 --> 06:15.295
BRENNAN:
Booth thinks it's odd,

06:15.330 --> 06:18.665
but I find relief when
analyzing decomposed remains.

06:18.700 --> 06:20.700
Yes, Booth
is correct.

06:20.736 --> 06:22.936
All right,
my sartorial work is finished.

06:22.971 --> 06:25.906
This guy is ready
to go freestyle.

06:25.941 --> 06:27.474
SAROYAN:
Discoloration

06:27.509 --> 06:29.743
to the scrotum.
Likely from trauma.

06:29.778 --> 06:31.912
Looks like our killer
fought dirty.

06:33.882 --> 06:35.081
Ms. Montenegro,

06:35.117 --> 06:36.650
it is so good to see you again.

06:36.685 --> 06:38.418
You too, Rodolfo.

06:38.453 --> 06:40.320
What?

06:40.355 --> 06:42.656
He's eye candy.
Just deal with it.

06:42.691 --> 06:44.825
Are you here just to gawk or did
you finish your reconstruction?

06:44.860 --> 06:46.960
Uh, well,
the skull was relatively

06:46.995 --> 06:50.297
unscathed, but before
I add dimension to the face,

06:50.332 --> 06:53.433
I do need an estimate
of the victim's weight.

06:53.468 --> 06:54.835
Oh...

06:56.171 --> 06:57.771
Based on

06:57.806 --> 07:01.107
the measurement of
the bi-iliac breadth,

07:01.143 --> 07:03.210
as well as
the femoral head,

07:03.245 --> 07:05.512
I'd say 136 kilograms.

07:05.547 --> 07:06.780
MONTENEGRO:
So...

07:06.815 --> 07:08.615
factoring in the weight...

07:11.553 --> 07:12.953
SAROYAN:
Oh, no.

07:12.988 --> 07:14.221
It's that guy.

07:14.256 --> 07:15.622
The blowhard.

07:15.657 --> 07:17.424
Is "blowhard"
some kind of a job?

07:17.459 --> 07:18.859
HODGINS:
He was a talk radio host

07:18.894 --> 07:20.093
who was ignorant and angry.

07:20.128 --> 07:21.595
It's a lethal combination.

07:21.630 --> 07:23.296
Well, it certainly
was for him.

07:30.939 --> 07:32.706
Hutch Whitehouse?
He's the victim?

07:32.741 --> 07:34.541
Yeah, do you know him?
Yeah.

07:34.576 --> 07:36.142
His fans are called
Hutchheads.

07:36.178 --> 07:37.477
He's, like, a big-time
conservative talk show host.

07:37.512 --> 07:39.312
Went to UVA
before dropping out

07:39.348 --> 07:40.947
to become a top 40 DJ.

07:40.983 --> 07:42.549
Now he's a right-wing icon,

07:42.584 --> 07:43.984
syndicated nationwide
to the tune of

07:44.019 --> 07:45.452
$10 million a year.

07:45.487 --> 07:47.187
He's pro-guns,
pro-capital punishment,

07:47.222 --> 07:49.456
pro-vouchers,
anti-immigrant, anti-choice,

07:49.491 --> 07:51.892
anti...
Wow. You really know your Hutch.

07:51.927 --> 07:53.627
Nah, I just did a background
check online.

07:53.662 --> 07:55.428
I really want on this case.

07:55.464 --> 07:57.197
Why, because it's a high profile case?
Yeah.

07:57.232 --> 07:59.032
And because he almost
made me throw up.

07:59.067 --> 08:00.667
His remains.
Aubrey,

08:00.702 --> 08:02.235
just put the football down
and go back to your desk.

08:02.271 --> 08:04.070
And, uh, one more thing.

08:04.106 --> 08:05.472
Uh, his wife of 15 years,

08:05.507 --> 08:07.741
Miriam, is waiting
in the conference room.

08:07.776 --> 08:09.142
Okay, all right, you know what?
I'll go talk

08:09.177 --> 08:10.577
to her, you hold on to that.

08:10.612 --> 08:12.212
I could come, too.
Nope, nope. I'm fine.

08:12.247 --> 08:14.114
Are you sure? You
handpicked me, remember?

08:14.149 --> 08:15.715
And Sweets agreed that...
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second.

08:15.751 --> 08:18.685
Okay, I picked you
to work for me, okay?

08:18.720 --> 08:20.820
Not to be my partner.
Let's not get that confused.

08:20.856 --> 08:22.088
You know,
me being here

08:22.124 --> 08:24.991
isn't the reason
Sweets is gone.

08:26.328 --> 08:29.062
I-I need to go talk
to this suspect, okay?

08:29.097 --> 08:32.032
So you just put that right
up on the wall up there.

08:35.404 --> 08:36.937
You say he was killed
three days ago?

08:36.972 --> 08:38.471
Well, approximately.

08:38.506 --> 08:39.940
See, the Jeffersonian,
they're still trying

08:39.975 --> 08:41.908
to be a little bit
more specific.

08:41.943 --> 08:43.777
So, um...

08:43.812 --> 08:45.445
You never reported
him missing.

08:45.480 --> 08:47.213
You didn't say anything
to the authorities.

08:47.249 --> 08:49.516
Hutch and I...

08:51.019 --> 08:55.088
...lately, we've led
separate lives.

08:55.123 --> 08:57.557
All right, so you were getting a divorce.
No.

08:57.592 --> 08:58.825
God, no.

08:58.860 --> 09:00.493
Just... busy.

09:00.529 --> 09:02.662
Hutch had his show,

09:02.698 --> 09:04.731
and I promote women's rights
issues all over the country.

09:04.766 --> 09:07.801
I was in Charlotte
three days ago.

09:07.836 --> 09:09.736
So you and Hutch weren't on
the same political wavelength.

09:09.771 --> 09:11.671
On some issues
we were,

09:11.707 --> 09:14.708
and some we weren't.

09:14.743 --> 09:16.810
Isn't that the way
it's supposed to be?

09:16.845 --> 09:20.213
Supposed to be, huh?

09:22.951 --> 09:25.418
Searching for a motive.

09:25.454 --> 09:26.686
I understand.

09:26.722 --> 09:27.887
I also stand

09:27.923 --> 09:29.203
to come into quite
a lot of money

09:29.224 --> 09:30.690
now that Hutch is gone.
Yeah, you do.

09:30.726 --> 09:34.027
$30 million worth,
according to this contract.

09:34.062 --> 09:35.729
Some people value
their relationship

09:35.764 --> 09:37.964
more than money.
You're right.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.141
So can you think of anyone who'd
want to hurt your husband?

09:40.142 --> 09:42.502
Half the people who listened to his show
probably wanted him dead.

09:42.537 --> 09:45.038
Right, he was offensive.

09:45.073 --> 09:48.108
You should talk to Bob Gordon,
his producer.

09:48.143 --> 09:49.509
And Alan, his co-host.

09:49.544 --> 09:51.745
They kept track
of all the crazies.

09:51.780 --> 09:54.614
Had to, for insurance reasons.

09:56.218 --> 09:57.517
FUENTES:
<i>All the damage</i>

09:57.552 --> 09:59.119
I found on the upper half

09:59.154 --> 10:00.887
of his remains is superficial.

10:00.922 --> 10:02.622
So you think
cause of death

10:02.657 --> 10:04.724
must be south of the border?
Yes.

10:04.760 --> 10:06.726
Unfortunately, I cannot
clean the bones

10:06.762 --> 10:09.863
until you are done
testing the urine.

10:09.898 --> 10:11.865
That is correct, Dr. Fuentes.

10:11.900 --> 10:13.967
So unless you want to test
the urine yourself...

10:14.002 --> 10:15.402
No, gracias.

10:20.442 --> 10:22.409
Okay. So the first
sample came back

10:22.444 --> 10:25.178
negative for
drugs, alcohol,

10:25.213 --> 10:27.680
no poisons...
Look at his cortisol level.

10:27.716 --> 10:28.882
SAROYAN:
That can't be right.

10:28.917 --> 10:30.150
When someone's
attacked,

10:30.185 --> 10:31.518
their cortisol levels spike.

10:31.553 --> 10:32.752
It's a direct response
to stress.

10:32.788 --> 10:34.654
And his oxytocin
levels are up.

10:36.058 --> 10:38.291
It's like he was
enjoying being murdered.

10:40.395 --> 10:42.395
HUTCH WHITEHOUSE:
<i>Everyone's talking about voter reform.</i>

10:42.431 --> 10:43.963
<i>How about this?</i>

10:43.999 --> 10:45.799
You don't speak English, you don't vote.
Oh.

10:45.834 --> 10:47.167
And those kids sneaking in?

10:47.202 --> 10:49.669
They grow up.
If we starve them out now,

10:49.704 --> 10:51.171
no problem in the future.

10:51.206 --> 10:52.505
There are simple solutions,
citizens.

10:52.541 --> 10:54.274
More guns, not less.

10:54.309 --> 10:55.608
Celebrate diversity?

10:55.644 --> 10:58.478
How about celebrate
our own kind? Huh?

10:58.513 --> 11:00.080
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Shut
that crap off, will you?

11:00.115 --> 11:01.381
Man, that's horrible.

11:01.416 --> 11:02.982
I was hoping you'd say that.

11:03.018 --> 11:04.484
Well, what do you know
about his producer?

11:04.519 --> 11:05.618
Well, his name is Bob Gordon.

11:05.654 --> 11:07.020
And he's a mega-billionaire.

11:07.055 --> 11:09.189
Like the one percent
of the one percent.

11:09.224 --> 11:12.192
He's also a big-time donor to
all the conservative super PACs.

11:12.227 --> 11:14.427
Did he have any beef with Hutch?
No reason to.

11:14.463 --> 11:16.162
Hutch was the golden goose.
He brought in hundreds

11:16.198 --> 11:18.064
of millions in ad revenue.

11:18.100 --> 11:19.365
He does have a record though.

11:19.401 --> 11:20.600
Two DUI's.

11:20.635 --> 11:22.335
One arrest for hunting deer

11:22.370 --> 11:23.570
without a license...

11:23.605 --> 11:25.038
while intoxicated.
Great.

11:25.073 --> 11:26.439
So drunk, armed and dangerous.

11:26.475 --> 11:27.974
What about Hutch's
on-air partner?

11:28.009 --> 11:29.175
Alan Spaziano.

11:29.211 --> 11:30.810
He was Hutch's
on-air punching bag.

11:30.846 --> 11:34.380
Hutch called him a Demo-crap,
one of his go-to jokes.

11:34.416 --> 11:36.049
Does he have a record?
No.

11:36.084 --> 11:39.185
Spaziano's so clean,
he's practically Canadian.

11:39.221 --> 11:40.987
Clean but humiliated.

11:41.115 --> 11:42.982
Sounds like a suspect to me.

11:43.017 --> 11:45.084
Yeah. Thanks for bringing me
along, Agent Booth.

11:45.119 --> 11:46.953
I really appreciate it.

11:46.988 --> 11:49.322
You should.

11:52.393 --> 11:53.926
MAN:
<i>How many times do I have</i>

11:53.962 --> 11:55.528
to say it till it gets
through that thick,

11:55.563 --> 11:57.771
commie skull of yours
that when you're fired,

11:57.772 --> 11:59.004
it means you don't
work here anymore?

11:59.041 --> 12:01.074
I can do the show
on my own, Bob.

12:01.108 --> 12:04.309
I don't need Hutch!
There's no money in liberal talk, Alan.

12:04.346 --> 12:05.912
"There's no money
in liberal talk, Alan.

12:05.947 --> 12:07.347
"And I should know 'cause

12:07.382 --> 12:08.982
all I care about is money."
It depends on who's

12:09.017 --> 12:10.550
doing the talking, Bob.
BOOTH: Okay, break it up.

12:10.585 --> 12:12.385
The two of you,
just get to your corners there

12:12.387 --> 12:14.654
and stop finger-pointing
at each other. FBI.

12:14.689 --> 12:17.424
We've got a few questions
we'd like to ask about Hutch.

12:17.459 --> 12:19.759
You're the producer?
Yeah. Bob Gordon.

12:19.795 --> 12:21.361
When's the last time
either one of you heard

12:21.396 --> 12:22.429
from Hutch?

12:22.464 --> 12:23.763
Three days ago.

12:23.799 --> 12:25.765
Early morning,
Hutch calls in,

12:25.801 --> 12:28.134
leaves some boo-hoo message
on my cell

12:28.170 --> 12:30.036
that he's feeling sick.

12:30.072 --> 12:32.405
So, you're the compassionate type?
Listen, two months ago,

12:32.441 --> 12:35.041
I gave Hutch a mega deal.

12:35.077 --> 12:36.476
Ever since, he's
been acting like

12:36.511 --> 12:38.078
a complete diva.
I went to his house

12:38.113 --> 12:39.946
to drag his butt out of bed,
only he wasn't there.

12:39.981 --> 12:41.291
Okay, great. Do you still
have that voice mail?

12:41.292 --> 12:42.301
I deleted it.

12:42.325 --> 12:44.085
You deleted it!
Well, that's pretty convenient.

12:44.086 --> 12:45.952
Okay, well, I'll tell you what.
Why don't you hand over

12:45.987 --> 12:47.758
your phone so we can help
retrieve those messages for you?

12:47.759 --> 12:49.325
You ever hear
of the Fourth Amendment?

12:49.360 --> 12:51.294
Yeah, it helps with people
who have something to hide.

12:51.329 --> 12:53.729
We can get a warrant, pull it
off your cell company's servers.

12:53.765 --> 12:55.131
I thought the government didn't
bother with warrants anymore.

12:55.166 --> 12:57.633
They just spy
on whoever they want.

12:57.669 --> 12:59.869
You-- Hutch's hobby
was to humiliate you, huh?

12:59.904 --> 13:02.438
Use you as a punching bag.
Hutch was just playing a part.

13:02.474 --> 13:04.140
He doesn't believe
half of what he's saying.

13:04.175 --> 13:06.175
The show is dead
and so is your career.

13:06.211 --> 13:07.743
Yeah. Not much
of a motive, is it?

13:07.779 --> 13:09.278
AUBREY: What about enemies
outside of the station?

13:09.314 --> 13:10.713
His wife said
you had to keep a record

13:10.748 --> 13:12.014
for the insurance company.

13:12.050 --> 13:14.550
Yeah. Be my guest.

13:19.791 --> 13:21.858
Those are just the
credible threats.

13:21.893 --> 13:23.793
Knock yourselves out.

13:23.828 --> 13:25.061
People really hated him.

13:25.096 --> 13:26.629
Yeah, what can I say?

13:26.664 --> 13:28.564
The man was a star.

13:34.741 --> 13:36.374
Dr. Fuentes?
I hear you have

13:36.409 --> 13:37.976
something of interest
to show me?

13:38.011 --> 13:40.178
I'm still cleaning
the southern half of the victim,

13:40.213 --> 13:41.880
but I want you to take a look

13:41.915 --> 13:43.948
at the radius, scaphoid
and trapezium.

13:47.621 --> 13:49.287
Perimortem ligature marks.

13:49.322 --> 13:52.023
The victim was bound
at time of death.

13:52.058 --> 13:54.959
I also found some bilateral
microfracturing on the hyoid.

13:54.995 --> 13:56.761
He was strangled.

13:56.797 --> 13:59.364
Although the pressure
wasn't sufficient to be fatal.

13:59.399 --> 14:00.865
So, still no cause of death.

14:00.901 --> 14:02.167
No.

14:02.202 --> 14:04.335
But I have seen injuries
like these before.

14:04.371 --> 14:07.005
In Habana I was told

14:07.040 --> 14:09.007
to obscure evidence
like this...

14:09.042 --> 14:10.842
after the Rapid
Response Brigades

14:10.877 --> 14:13.111
would interrogate
a prisoner.

14:13.146 --> 14:15.013
The secret police.

14:15.048 --> 14:18.983
Yes. Another reason
why I defected.

14:19.019 --> 14:21.586
These lacerations
to the wrists,

14:21.621 --> 14:23.488
plus the strangulation
and the repeated

14:23.523 --> 14:24.989
strikes to the genitals...

14:25.025 --> 14:27.091
The victim was tortured
prior to death.

14:27.127 --> 14:29.627
Yes. But what was it
they wanted to know?

14:31.000 --> 14:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:39.506 --> 14:41.272
Wow. All these
boxes are filled

14:41.308 --> 14:42.941
with threatening
letters to the victim?

14:42.976 --> 14:45.009
Yeah, Booth read over everything

14:45.045 --> 14:46.644
looking for potential suspects.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.546
"Booth"? Booth read
through all this?

14:48.582 --> 14:50.348
Hey, I tried to help,
but apparently

14:50.383 --> 14:52.584
Booth's trust
doesn't extend that far.

14:52.619 --> 14:54.485
These are the letters
he thought stood out.

14:54.521 --> 14:56.154
And these are all
from the same guy?

14:56.189 --> 14:58.523
Yeah. I took a quick glance.
I agree with Booth.

14:58.558 --> 14:59.718
Dude was obsessed with Hutch.

14:59.726 --> 15:01.086
Each letter rants
against something

15:01.094 --> 15:02.460
he said on his show.

15:02.495 --> 15:03.495
So, an angry liberal?

15:03.530 --> 15:04.662
You'd think, but no.

15:04.698 --> 15:06.064
Radical conservative.

15:06.099 --> 15:07.999
Thought Hutch was too soft.

15:08.869 --> 15:10.568
Oh.

15:10.604 --> 15:12.370
From the postmark,
I was able to determine

15:12.405 --> 15:14.372
which post office
picked up the letter.

15:14.407 --> 15:16.975
So, it was somewhere
in this area.

15:17.010 --> 15:18.576
Did you cross-reference that

15:18.612 --> 15:20.044
with individuals
with criminal records?

15:20.080 --> 15:21.346
I did.

15:22.582 --> 15:23.915
SAROYAN:
Yikes, 78 names.

15:23.950 --> 15:25.116
Remind me not to walk

15:25.151 --> 15:26.451
in that neighborhood at night.

15:26.486 --> 15:27.986
Yeah, all the letters had pretty

15:28.021 --> 15:31.222
basic grammar and punctuation,
sloppy penmanship.

15:31.258 --> 15:33.224
Yeah, probably no more
than a high school education.

15:33.260 --> 15:36.194
Okay, well, when I eliminate
the college graduates,

15:36.229 --> 15:38.796
I'm left with
a list of 45 names.

15:38.832 --> 15:40.072
Oh, we can get that number down

15:40.100 --> 15:42.100
because the king has arrived.

15:42.135 --> 15:45.003
King of the lab?
Isn't that a little passé?

15:45.038 --> 15:46.738
I found some trace
on the reverse side

15:46.773 --> 15:48.673
of a couple of the letters.
I put it up on the server.

15:48.708 --> 15:50.475
This guy's anger actually
worked well for us.

15:50.510 --> 15:51.743
He pushed so hard

15:51.778 --> 15:52.877
with his pen that the paper

15:52.913 --> 15:54.012
picked up particulates

15:54.047 --> 15:55.680
from the writing surface below.

15:55.715 --> 15:58.016
Asbestos, PCB and lead.

15:58.051 --> 15:59.584
Meaning he is living
in a building

15:59.619 --> 16:01.719
which should be condemned.
Thank you, thank you.

16:01.755 --> 16:03.421
Hold the coronation,
Your Majesty.

16:03.456 --> 16:04.756
All right.

16:04.791 --> 16:07.158
Okay, just look up
buildings in the area

16:07.193 --> 16:09.761
which failed inspection.

16:12.265 --> 16:14.632
SAROYAN:
Wow, okay.

16:14.668 --> 16:15.967
MONTENEGRO:
William Byers,

16:16.002 --> 16:17.902
arrested two years ago
for assaulting

16:17.938 --> 16:20.638
a Muslim with a baseball bat.

16:20.674 --> 16:22.140
All hail the king, baby.

16:22.175 --> 16:24.509
King of the lab!

16:24.544 --> 16:26.077
Oh, boy.

16:26.112 --> 16:27.578
I had a local black and white

16:27.614 --> 16:29.347
confirm that Byers is home.

16:29.382 --> 16:31.482
Yeah, me, too. Heading there now.
Oh, I'll just be a sec.

16:31.518 --> 16:33.418
No, no, no.
Taking Bones.

16:33.453 --> 16:35.286
But the guy's a psycho.
He could be dangerous.

16:35.322 --> 16:37.555
What? You don't think
I can take care of myself?

16:37.590 --> 16:39.190
What? No! But I could help.

16:39.225 --> 16:41.125
I get it that it's tough
to trust somebody new.

16:41.161 --> 16:42.927
But I thought we were really
starting to get along.

16:42.963 --> 16:44.762
Right. That's good.
That is good.

16:44.798 --> 16:47.865
Why don't you let things just,
uh, run their course, okay?

16:47.901 --> 16:50.601
Sure.

16:50.637 --> 16:53.271
BRENNAN:
<i>If Byers is dangerous,</i>

16:53.306 --> 16:54.973
why didn't you bring
Agent Aubrey as backup?

16:55.008 --> 16:56.541
He's a good agent, isn't he?
Look...

16:56.576 --> 16:57.709
Aubrey is fine, okay?

16:57.744 --> 17:00.044
But you, you are my partner.

17:00.080 --> 17:03.348
Your world has to be bigger
than just you and me, Booth.

17:03.383 --> 17:05.683
It is, all right?
I'm back to work, aren't I?

17:05.719 --> 17:07.752
Well, objectively
that's true.

17:07.787 --> 17:09.220
But you still don't seem
to trust anyone.

17:09.255 --> 17:11.155
And you have to,
to do this job.

17:11.191 --> 17:12.522
I trust you.

17:12.559 --> 17:15.159
Then listen to me. Sweets said
that you have to believe

17:15.194 --> 17:17.194
in something again,
something bigger than yourself.

17:17.230 --> 17:18.230
I do.

17:18.263 --> 17:19.731
My family.

17:19.766 --> 17:21.098
You haven't been to church

17:21.134 --> 17:22.214
since you've been released.

17:22.234 --> 17:23.334
You don't even believe in God.

17:23.369 --> 17:24.535
But you do.

17:24.570 --> 17:25.570
And you used to believe

17:25.571 --> 17:27.137
that people were good.

17:27.173 --> 17:28.840
And they deserve to be trusted.
Look, Bo-- let's not,

17:28.875 --> 17:31.175
not now, all right, Bones?
Not when we're about to go

17:31.211 --> 17:33.344
after a murder suspect.
Look, I love you,

17:33.380 --> 17:35.213
but you really have no idea
what you're talking about.

17:35.248 --> 17:37.382
I made a professional call
with Aubrey, that's it.

17:37.417 --> 17:39.884
I am fine.

17:44.324 --> 17:45.390
(muffled music playing)

17:45.425 --> 17:47.458
FBI, Mr. Byers. Open up!

17:47.494 --> 17:48.893
I don't think he can
hear you, Booth.

17:48.928 --> 17:50.728
The music is at
least 85 decibels.

17:50.764 --> 17:53.398
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:53.433 --> 17:54.866
If it's safe enough not to bring Aubrey...
Just...

17:54.901 --> 17:56.401
...it's safe enough to enter.

17:56.436 --> 17:58.736
Just stay behind me,
you understand?

17:58.772 --> 18:00.772
Mr. Byers? FBI.

18:00.807 --> 18:03.007
Your door was unlocked.

18:03.043 --> 18:04.609
The music is horrible.
Mr. Byers?

18:04.644 --> 18:06.210
Oh, Booth?

18:07.614 --> 18:08.946
He's ordering fertilizer.

18:08.982 --> 18:10.214
He's making a bomb.

18:11.451 --> 18:12.884
(music stops)

18:12.919 --> 18:14.199
What the hell are
you doing here?

18:14.220 --> 18:15.753
All right, hold it
right there. FBI.

18:17.223 --> 18:19.157
Whoa, whoa, whoa, all right.
All right, easy.

18:19.192 --> 18:20.525
Come on.
Booth,

18:20.560 --> 18:22.126
oh!
(grunts)

18:22.162 --> 18:24.195
Easy. Easy.
All right.

18:24.230 --> 18:26.197
BYERS: I do not recognize
your authority.

18:26.232 --> 18:28.433
(grunting)

18:29.404 --> 18:31.367
So we found your manifesto
in your apartment.

18:31.368 --> 18:32.501
I tell you, there's a lot

18:32.501 --> 18:34.100
of misspelled
words in there.

18:34.136 --> 18:36.536
So now the problem's
believing in the white race?

18:36.571 --> 18:37.398
When it's all the foreigners

18:37.421 --> 18:39.427
that are coming in here
and destroying the country.

18:39.541 --> 18:40.886
Is that who you were gonna make
the bombs for?

18:40.910 --> 18:42.176
You got to open your eyes, man.

18:42.177 --> 18:45.945
The Mexicans are coming in here,
taking our jobs. The blacks,

18:45.981 --> 18:48.648
all of 'em on drugs.
What about Hutch Whitehouse?

18:48.683 --> 18:50.450
The traitor?

18:50.485 --> 18:53.086
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I mean, he talks a good game.

18:53.121 --> 18:54.487
But when I wanted him
to spread the word

18:54.523 --> 18:56.363
about the armed uprising,
you know what he did?

18:56.391 --> 18:58.324
He slithered off
like a little garter snake.

18:58.326 --> 19:00.460
So he doesn't deserve to

19:00.495 --> 19:02.529
much less be the spokesman.
Which is probably why

19:02.564 --> 19:05.965
he was murdered
three days ago, right?

19:07.302 --> 19:09.602
God works in mysterious ways,
doesn't He?

19:09.638 --> 19:11.538
He sure does. So
did you do it?

19:11.573 --> 19:14.674
Did you murder him?
Did you kill him?

19:16.978 --> 19:18.678
Let me tell you something,

19:18.713 --> 19:20.980
I ain't a coward like Hutch.

19:21.016 --> 19:24.350
So, yeah, I admit it. I did it.

19:24.386 --> 19:27.453
And everybody's gonna know
my name. So you can let

19:27.489 --> 19:29.622
everybody know that
that's the future that they have

19:29.658 --> 19:31.658
if they don't support
white America.

19:31.693 --> 19:32.327
You tortured him.

19:32.351 --> 19:34.243
He begged for mercy,
and I didn't give him none.

19:34.663 --> 19:36.623
Just finished him off,
you cut his head clean off.

19:36.631 --> 19:38.064
That's-that's right.
That's how you send a message.

19:38.099 --> 19:39.532
That's how you create a name
for yourself.

19:39.568 --> 19:41.167
You got it. You got it.
I took him by his fat neck

19:41.203 --> 19:43.670
and I sliced deeper
and deeper.

19:43.705 --> 19:45.473
WA... Hey, where you going?
Where you going?

19:45.497 --> 19:46.407
Hey, you know what,

19:46.408 --> 19:48.608
you're lying, okay?
He wasn't decapitated.

19:48.643 --> 19:50.510
S-So, wait, you just gonna...
y-you gonna...

19:50.545 --> 19:52.445
just gonna let me...
let me go?

19:52.469 --> 19:53.180
No.

19:53.181 --> 19:55.682
No, I mean, you were gonna make
a fertilizer bomb. You're just

19:55.717 --> 19:58.017
a pure white terrorist who's
going to jail for a long,

19:58.053 --> 19:59.285
long time,
and I'm gonna make sure

19:59.321 --> 20:01.254
that no one ever knows
your name.

20:01.289 --> 20:03.857
(door opens)

20:13.935 --> 20:16.536
<i>La Tierra llamando</i>
Dr. Brennan.

20:16.571 --> 20:18.638
<i>Por favor...</i>
What, Dr. Fuentes?

20:18.673 --> 20:21.407
I-I was concentrating
on the radius.

20:21.443 --> 20:24.410
're positing
torture, but...

20:24.446 --> 20:26.546
look at the damage
to the radius.

20:26.581 --> 20:29.549
Mmm. I see what you mean.

20:29.584 --> 20:31.351
Compared to what I've seen
in Cuba,

20:31.386 --> 20:33.419
the damage is relatively slight.
SAROYAN: So...

20:33.455 --> 20:35.455
we're looking
for a compassionate torturer?

20:35.490 --> 20:37.223
And look at the pelvis.

20:37.259 --> 20:39.359
There's evidence
of calcification.

20:39.394 --> 20:41.995
Which would suggest that he had
been hit in the <i> cojones</i> before.

20:42.030 --> 20:44.898
Based on the topography
of the calcification,

20:44.933 --> 20:46.833
I'd say multiple times
in the last year.

20:46.868 --> 20:50.003
That might explain
his low cortisol levels.

20:50.038 --> 20:51.738
If he'd been tortured before,
he could become accustomed

20:51.773 --> 20:53.006
to the pain.

20:53.041 --> 20:54.774
Look. Look at

20:54.809 --> 20:56.876
the ligature marks
on the victim's wrists.

20:56.912 --> 21:00.480
Calcification of the
scaphoid and trapezium.

21:00.515 --> 21:03.249
<i>Eres una mujer</i>
<i>brillante y hermosa.</i>

21:03.285 --> 21:05.151
(chuckles) <i>Sí.</i>
Isn't that

21:05.186 --> 21:07.453
what happens when someone's
bound and tortured?

21:07.489 --> 21:11.190
He was tortured.
But it was his choice.

21:11.226 --> 21:13.726
So he was into S and M?

21:13.762 --> 21:16.262
Yes. He enjoyed it.

21:19.034 --> 21:21.067
Booth asked me to look
into Hutch's finances.

21:21.102 --> 21:23.269
I found a lot
of big cash withdrawals

21:23.305 --> 21:25.038
on the nights he wasn't home.

21:25.073 --> 21:26.272
For his dominatrix.

21:26.308 --> 21:28.474
Well, S and M is hip now
apparently.

21:28.510 --> 21:30.710
<i>50 Shades of Grey</i>
is outselling <i> Harry Potter.</i>

21:30.745 --> 21:31.945
Hutch,

21:31.980 --> 21:33.746
h-he was a public figure.
I just...

21:33.782 --> 21:36.382
I can't see him doing the deed
at home or in a hotel

21:36.418 --> 21:38.284
or someplace
where he has no control.

21:38.320 --> 21:39.886
Oh, you're good.

21:39.921 --> 21:42.689
Give me a sec. Hutch had
a loan-out corporation,

21:42.724 --> 21:46.192
and one of the assets was
an office space that's empty.

21:46.227 --> 21:50.330
But for some reason he spent
six grand to soundproof it.

21:50.365 --> 21:52.632
Looks like we found ourselves
a sex dungeon.

21:52.667 --> 21:53.933
You want to tell Booth

21:53.969 --> 21:54.969
or should I?

21:54.970 --> 21:56.169
No, you call him.

21:56.204 --> 22:00.039
It should come
from someone he trusts.

22:02.677 --> 22:05.278
BOOTH:
<i>It's creepy, right?</i>

22:05.313 --> 22:08.081
I mean, sex is about love,
not being tied up and beaten.

22:08.116 --> 22:10.016
I disagree.
What?

22:10.051 --> 22:14.153
Sex and violence are two
of humanity's most primal urges.

22:14.189 --> 22:17.423
An amalgamation of them
is a logical by-product.

22:17.459 --> 22:19.425
Bones, S and M isn't
a peanut butter cup.

22:19.461 --> 22:21.761
It's not two great
tastes that go together.

22:21.796 --> 22:23.463
You enjoy being bitten.

22:23.498 --> 22:24.864
Bi... No, I don't.

22:24.899 --> 22:27.166
When we make love,
sometimes I nibble your ear.

22:27.202 --> 22:30.136
Your response is very positive
to say the least.

22:30.171 --> 22:33.673
Look, a nibble is a lot
different an being whipped.

22:33.708 --> 22:36.042
All degrees
of the same thing.

22:36.077 --> 22:37.777
Look, I think the Inquisition,
you know, would've been

22:37.812 --> 22:39.812
a lot different with
nibbling, if you ask me.

22:43.151 --> 22:45.952
BOOTH (whistles):
Whoa, look at this place.

22:45.987 --> 22:48.421
You could perform
Cirque Du Soleil in here.

22:48.456 --> 22:52.125
There are many
possible murder weapons.

22:52.160 --> 22:57.330
Whips, chains, nipple
clamps, Luna beads...

22:57.365 --> 22:59.065
Ah, you sound excited
there, Bones.

22:59.100 --> 23:01.968
Wha... I'm fascinated,
as a scientist.

23:02.003 --> 23:02.935
Ooh.

23:02.971 --> 23:05.204
Right. Okay.

23:05.240 --> 23:06.773
You know, I can probably
get to two shades

23:06.808 --> 23:08.007
of Grey, but I'm not
gonna be making 50.

23:08.043 --> 23:09.442
I'll tell you that.
There should be

23:09.477 --> 23:10.943
something here that could give
us cause of death.

23:10.979 --> 23:12.845
Look at this in the chair,
it looks like dried blood.

23:12.881 --> 23:15.748
This could potentially be
where he was murdered.

23:15.784 --> 23:17.083
Mm-hmm.

23:18.420 --> 23:19.420
Definitely blood.

23:19.454 --> 23:20.386
Hmm.

23:20.422 --> 23:22.088
BRENNAN:
Hmm.

23:22.123 --> 23:24.924
I'm seeing a lot
of bodily fluid, as well.

23:24.959 --> 23:25.992
No surprise there.

23:26.027 --> 23:27.226
Everywhere, Booth.

23:27.262 --> 23:29.262
They must have been
having sex as well.

23:29.297 --> 23:31.731
At least he got
something out of it.

23:31.766 --> 23:33.332
No, with the damage
to his testicles,

23:33.368 --> 23:35.301
the sex would have
caused even more pain.

23:35.336 --> 23:38.004
Right, right. Okay.

23:38.039 --> 23:39.972
Well, if the dominatrix's DNA
is on file,

23:40.008 --> 23:42.108
you know, I can bring her in.

23:43.878 --> 23:45.978
MONTENEGRO: <i> This is</i>
<i>a recreation of the victim.</i>

23:46.014 --> 23:47.246
Okay, can
we move close

23:47.282 --> 23:48.448
into the
victim's skull.

23:50.018 --> 23:51.717
Okay.

23:51.753 --> 23:53.352
Now, I reevaluated
the cracked dentition

23:53.388 --> 23:55.655
and nasal bone fractures
I found earlier.

23:55.690 --> 23:56.956
Originally, I thought

23:56.991 --> 23:58.691
that it was the result
of multiple strikes.

23:58.726 --> 24:00.993
You think a single strike
did all this damage?

24:01.029 --> 24:02.261
I hope so.

24:02.297 --> 24:03.896
Now, it was so much
easier in Cuba

24:03.932 --> 24:05.998
when we could just make up
the evidence we needed.

24:06.034 --> 24:07.567
But since we don't
have that luxury,

24:07.602 --> 24:10.970
please put a ball gag
into the victim's mouth.

24:11.005 --> 24:12.205
Yeah. Uh...

24:12.240 --> 24:13.573
A ball gag...

24:13.608 --> 24:15.842
It's a common piece of
S and M paraphernalia,

24:15.877 --> 24:17.310
but it wasn't
at his office.

24:17.345 --> 24:18.911
I know what a ball gag is,

24:18.947 --> 24:21.814
I just don't have
the graphic in my system.

24:21.850 --> 24:24.050
Oh. How strange.

24:24.085 --> 24:26.519
What about a golf ball?

24:26.554 --> 24:28.020
What about a
squash ball?

24:28.056 --> 24:30.556
That is a much more
accurate facsimile.

24:30.592 --> 24:32.258
Oh, yeah. That's a great idea.

24:32.293 --> 24:34.427
We had a guy die on a squash
court once-- so that's perfect.

24:34.462 --> 24:35.995
I mean, it's
not <i> perfect.</i>

24:36.030 --> 24:37.396
But it's... it's helpful for...

24:37.432 --> 24:38.664
Yeah.
...this.

24:39.734 --> 24:41.601
Okay,
squash-ball gag.

24:41.636 --> 24:44.370
Now, simulate a strike
to the victim's face.

24:44.405 --> 24:46.139
We don't yet have
a murder weapon,

24:46.174 --> 24:48.441
but it's got to be something
flat and hard,

24:48.476 --> 24:49.476
like a piece of tile,

24:49.511 --> 24:50.977
but with
enough force

24:51.012 --> 24:52.545
to fracture the
nasal bone.

24:52.580 --> 24:53.946
Okay.

24:53.982 --> 24:56.048
But it's not gonna be
enough to kill him.

25:02.190 --> 25:04.690
Oh. But, look,
it did kill him.

25:04.726 --> 25:07.293
The nasal bone fractures caused
the victim's nose

25:07.328 --> 25:09.162
to swell and obstruct
the airway.

25:09.197 --> 25:10.197
Right. Yes.

25:10.231 --> 25:12.064
And with his nose swollen shut

25:12.100 --> 25:13.466
and the ball gag in his mouth,

25:13.501 --> 25:14.567
he would have suffocated.

25:14.602 --> 25:16.202
We found cause of death.

25:16.237 --> 25:17.770
But wait.

25:17.805 --> 25:19.885
Why wouldn't the dominatrix
have removed the ball gag

25:19.908 --> 25:22.341
and saved his life?

25:26.238 --> 25:28.241
So, Ms. Skarsgard,

25:28.242 --> 25:30.042
we found your DNA

25:30.077 --> 25:31.343
in Hutch Whitehouse's...

25:31.378 --> 25:32.611
what is it-- dungeon?

25:32.646 --> 25:34.113
I'd call it a
fantasy space.

25:34.148 --> 25:35.514
And of course you
found my DNA there.

25:35.549 --> 25:36.748
I'm not a
housekeeper.

25:36.784 --> 25:38.383
It was Hutch's
job to clean up.

25:38.419 --> 25:39.685
Oh, fantasy space?

25:39.720 --> 25:41.120
Right.

25:41.155 --> 25:43.922
Last year you were arrested
on assault charges.

25:43.958 --> 25:44.990
An angry wife.

25:45.025 --> 25:46.892
I was defending myself.

25:46.927 --> 25:48.460
Well,<i> two</i> angry wives,
it says here.

25:48.496 --> 25:50.195
Wow, you really have
a penchant for violence.

25:50.231 --> 25:52.764
Agent Booth, I'm a dominatrix.

25:52.800 --> 25:54.166
If the rough stuff
bothered me,

25:54.201 --> 25:55.968
I wouldn't be fit to do my job.

25:56.003 --> 25:58.470
Both charges were dropped,
by the way.

25:58.506 --> 25:59.605
Right, maybe not this time.

25:59.640 --> 26:00.939
What is
this about?

26:00.975 --> 26:03.008
Is Hutch pressing charges
or something?

26:03.043 --> 26:04.376
No, Hutch is dead.

26:04.411 --> 26:05.811
He choked on his ball gag

26:05.846 --> 26:07.646
after being smashed
in the face.

26:07.681 --> 26:09.448
Oh, my God.

26:09.483 --> 26:11.216
You really thought
you could get away with it, huh?

26:11.252 --> 26:13.185
You think that...

26:14.421 --> 26:16.989
No. This would not
happen on my watch.

26:17.024 --> 26:18.957
I'm a professional.

26:18.993 --> 26:21.660
Oh, a professional. What, do you
guys have some kind of a union?

26:21.695 --> 26:23.929
I'm a licensed
therapist.

26:23.964 --> 26:25.964
I provided a safe,
reliable service.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.933
Right, so you were
his, um...

26:27.968 --> 26:29.768
(chuckles) ...therapist?
Yes.

26:29.803 --> 26:31.837
Hutch felt great guilt
that he made his money

26:31.872 --> 26:33.639
inciting the worst in people.
Oh,

26:33.674 --> 26:35.040
and your beatings
helped him with that?

26:35.075 --> 26:36.375
I never beat him.

26:36.410 --> 26:37.770
He was disciplined,
which fulfilled

26:37.778 --> 26:39.912
his need to feel punished.

26:39.947 --> 26:41.713
Making progress, too.
I can't believe he's dead.

26:41.749 --> 26:43.081
Progress?

26:43.117 --> 26:44.917
Wow, what-what kind
of progress were you making?

26:44.952 --> 26:46.685
Hutch was thinking
of quitting his show,

26:46.720 --> 26:48.554
becoming a moderate,
a voice of reason.

26:48.589 --> 26:51.590
Agent Booth, I swear, when
I left him he was fine.

26:51.625 --> 26:53.992
He could have released himself
whenever he wanted to.

26:54.028 --> 26:56.094
When you left him-- well,
you left him bound and gagged.

26:56.130 --> 26:58.430
Abandonment was
important to Hutch.

26:58.465 --> 27:01.466
But the handcuffs and restraints
I used had safety releases.

27:01.502 --> 27:05.037
It was up to him to decide
when he had had enough.

27:05.072 --> 27:08.106
I would never
harm a client.

27:12.279 --> 27:14.680
Both distal tibias
and fibulas indicate

27:14.715 --> 27:16.882
he visited this woman
quite frequently.

27:16.917 --> 27:19.251
I should have ruled out
torture much earlier.

27:19.286 --> 27:21.954
Both of us were deceived
by the evidence.

27:22.236 --> 27:23.898
Now Booth needs
more evidence

27:23.899 --> 27:25.632
to tie the dominatrix
to the crime.

27:25.667 --> 27:26.866
Of course.

27:26.902 --> 27:28.802
How is your husband?

27:28.837 --> 27:30.537
Is it difficult for you

27:30.572 --> 27:31.871
now that he has been back?

27:31.907 --> 27:33.139
From prison?

27:33.175 --> 27:35.041
Is this another
attempt to bed me?

27:35.076 --> 27:37.443
Because Booth and I are fine.
No.

27:37.479 --> 27:39.712
Not at all. I just know
the effects of trauma.

27:39.748 --> 27:41.981
My brother was betrayed
by the police he worked with.

27:42.017 --> 27:43.550
Like Booth.

27:43.585 --> 27:45.318
Oh. I'm sorry,

27:45.353 --> 27:48.087
I... I assumed you were...
Oh, please.

27:48.123 --> 27:49.389
You're beautiful, I'm handsome,

27:49.424 --> 27:50.824
misunderstandings like this
are common

27:50.859 --> 27:52.058
between people such as us.

27:52.093 --> 27:53.860
True.

27:53.895 --> 27:55.228
Mm.

27:55.263 --> 27:56.830
What happened to your brother?

27:56.865 --> 27:58.832
Well, he had to learn
to accept that there were things

27:58.867 --> 28:01.301
that were beyond his control.
That's part of life.

28:01.336 --> 28:02.669
So he
accepted the

28:02.704 --> 28:04.170
basic principles
of quantum physics.

28:04.206 --> 28:05.705
He knows

28:05.740 --> 28:07.807
nothing of physics.
But he accepted the basic

28:07.843 --> 28:10.276
principles of the
Callan-Symanzik equation,

28:10.312 --> 28:14.514
which states that expectations
will fail in a quantum world.

28:14.549 --> 28:17.116
Thank you for
that, Dr. Fuentes.

28:17.152 --> 28:19.252
I'm not sure what I did.

28:21.056 --> 28:24.457
There's a tendon fiber
imbedded in the tibia.

28:24.492 --> 28:26.559
I also found a gap
in the cortical bone

28:26.595 --> 28:28.261
near where
the tendon attaches.

28:28.296 --> 28:30.897
The victim was pulled
at the extremities

28:30.932 --> 28:33.600
by a device like a rack.
Did you find

28:33.635 --> 28:35.516
any such device in the
victim's S and M retreat?

28:35.523 --> 28:36.904
No.

28:36.905 --> 28:39.405
Which suggests
perhaps he was seeing

28:39.441 --> 28:41.908
more than one dominatrix.

28:44.145 --> 28:46.312
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, yeah, okay.

28:46.348 --> 28:48.114
Right, thanks.

28:48.149 --> 28:50.116
Yeah, that was Bones.
She-She was

28:50.151 --> 28:53.219
saying that the, uh, the body
was, uh, stretched or something.

28:53.255 --> 28:55.955
You know? But it couldn't
have happened in that room.

28:55.991 --> 28:59.023
You know, maybe it was...
was, uh, another dominatrix.

28:59.024 --> 28:59.856
Yeah, or his wife.

28:59.880 --> 29:01.351
No, no, not the wife.
She was out of town.

29:01.351 --> 29:03.952
Yeah, but I talked to the
front desk clerk at the hotel

29:03.987 --> 29:05.985
in Charlotte where she was
staying when he was killed.

29:05.986 --> 29:08.420
And the alibi-- did it stick?
Yes and no.

29:08.455 --> 29:09.888
Uh, we should bring
her in. And when we do,

29:09.923 --> 29:11.923
I want to be there
for the interrogation.

29:11.958 --> 29:13.391
Oh, you want to be there?

29:13.427 --> 29:15.059
Well, you can't
always get what you want.

29:15.095 --> 29:16.828
That's a Rolling Stones song.

29:16.863 --> 29:19.303
You should keep playing that in
your head over and over again.

29:19.332 --> 29:22.033
(laughs) You are an idiot,
you know that?

29:22.068 --> 29:24.569
Excuse me?
Do you really think

29:24.604 --> 29:26.237
you're gonna do
better than me?

29:26.273 --> 29:27.939
You should get out while you can.
Look,

29:27.974 --> 29:31.276
I know that what happened
to you is messed up.

29:31.311 --> 29:33.311
And then what
happened to Sweets.

29:33.346 --> 29:36.147
But remember

29:36.183 --> 29:39.417
that Sweets trusted
me to work with you.

29:39.453 --> 29:41.453
So when you treat
me like crap,

29:41.488 --> 29:43.655
you're treating
Sweets like crap, too.

29:47.828 --> 29:50.995
Here's everything I got
from talking to the hotel.

29:53.166 --> 29:55.633
Good luck with the wife.

29:59.973 --> 30:02.307
I don't know what the fuss
is all about-- so I requested

30:02.342 --> 30:04.742
a ground floor room at my hotel.
Lots of people do that.

30:04.778 --> 30:06.578
Right, but they usually don't
threaten the front desk until

30:06.613 --> 30:08.813
they get that room. Why
was that so important?

30:08.849 --> 30:11.282
I did not kill my husband.

30:11.318 --> 30:13.785
Oh, no, you just wanted a room
right near the exit, right?

30:13.820 --> 30:15.687
So, what, you could sneak
out, go to the movies

30:15.722 --> 30:17.196
and come back without
anyone knowing?

30:17.220 --> 30:19.161
I was in that hotel room
all night long.

30:19.162 --> 30:20.158
That doesn't clear you,
you know? If you were

30:20.193 --> 30:22.193
seeing another man, you're
gonna want your husband dead.

30:22.229 --> 30:24.195
I was not having an affair.
That's how Hutch

30:24.231 --> 30:26.865
dealt with his problems. I tried
to help him so that he wouldn't

30:26.900 --> 30:28.967
have to get slapped around
or whatever

30:29.002 --> 30:31.503
it was that he did.
So you know about the dominatrix?

30:31.538 --> 30:33.505
I know that Hutch was miserable.

30:33.540 --> 30:35.406
He hated the work he was doing.

30:35.442 --> 30:38.042
I tried to help him,
but all he wanted was her.

30:38.078 --> 30:40.411
Anger. Another motive.

30:43.683 --> 30:46.718
That night...

30:46.753 --> 30:48.119
I was dealing with things

30:48.154 --> 30:50.088
my way.

30:50.123 --> 30:52.991
I needed
that room

30:53.026 --> 30:55.093
so that I could buy drugs

30:55.128 --> 30:58.096
without anyone seeing me.

30:58.131 --> 31:00.131
It would've ruined Hutch
if I got caught.

31:00.166 --> 31:02.233
Drugs? Okay, I'm gonna need
the name of that dealer.

31:02.269 --> 31:04.102
I don't know his name.
And it wouldn't

31:04.137 --> 31:06.371
matter if I did, because
I don't have an alibi.

31:06.406 --> 31:09.107
Not until 8:00 a.m.
the next morning.

31:09.142 --> 31:10.708
You have to believe me.

31:10.744 --> 31:12.143
I have a problem.

31:12.178 --> 31:13.578
Yes, you have a problem.

31:13.613 --> 31:16.881
And you have a big problem.

31:18.151 --> 31:20.051
FUENTES:
<i>I reevaluated</i>

31:20.086 --> 31:22.720
the tears to the victim's
tibias and fibulas.

31:22.756 --> 31:25.623
The ones we thought
were caused by stretching?

31:25.659 --> 31:28.893
Yes. The problem I discovered
was the lack of resistance

31:28.929 --> 31:30.762
from any of the surrounding
tendons or cartilage.

31:30.797 --> 31:32.463
I thought it was because
he was unconscious.

31:32.499 --> 31:34.899
Even unconscious,
the body exhibits

31:34.935 --> 31:37.268
an involuntary resistance
to injury.

31:37.304 --> 31:40.371
Which is what I explained to the
good doctor. He had to be dead

31:40.407 --> 31:41.237
for the injuries to occur.

31:41.260 --> 31:43.260
So the stretching
was caused when his body

31:43.343 --> 31:44.976
was moved under the
bridge for disposal.

31:45.011 --> 31:47.445
Dragging wouldn't have
caused the injury.

31:47.480 --> 31:48.880
But suspending him would,

31:48.915 --> 31:50.882
if he was upside down
with his full weight

31:50.917 --> 31:53.651
pulling his tendons taut.
So how does someone move

31:53.687 --> 31:56.220
a man the size of a small
elephant? Well, I went back

31:56.256 --> 31:59.290
and I checked our victim's socks
and the cuffs on his pants.

31:59.326 --> 32:02.427
He really is quite brilliant.
As are you, Doctor.

32:02.462 --> 32:03.528
Thank you.
I'm waiting.

32:03.552 --> 32:04.195
Right, right.

32:04.197 --> 32:06.230
So I found animal
hair. Some weasel,

32:06.266 --> 32:08.466
but mostly white tail deer,
which at first was confusing,

32:08.501 --> 32:11.069
'cause I thought, Bambi, why are
you an accomplice to a murder?

32:11.104 --> 32:13.471
Of course.
The killer used

32:13.506 --> 32:15.707
a deer hoist to move the victim.

32:15.742 --> 32:17.008
That's right.
What is a deer hoist?

32:17.043 --> 32:18.409
It, uh...
Hunters use them

32:18.445 --> 32:19.944
in order to hang
and transport

32:19.980 --> 32:21.613
the deer that they've
shot. But now

32:21.648 --> 32:23.681
we got to figure out who uses...
We already have.

32:23.717 --> 32:27.285
Hutch Whitehouse's producer
is a deer hunter.

32:33.218 --> 32:35.209
So we recovered Hutch's blood from your truck.

32:35.210 --> 32:36.825
I'm a hunter, there's no secret

32:36.826 --> 32:39.293
about that. If you found blood,
it would have been deer blood.

32:39.329 --> 32:41.395
I loved Hutch.

32:41.431 --> 32:43.064
Based on
your views

32:43.099 --> 32:46.400
of climate change, I know
that science is not your forte,

32:46.436 --> 32:49.704
but trust me, the blood work
is incontrovertible.

32:49.739 --> 32:51.038
Well, maybe, uh,
someone took my truck.

32:51.074 --> 32:52.306
It was the middle
of the night.

32:52.342 --> 32:53.808
You seriously want
to go with that?

32:53.843 --> 32:55.409
'Cause the prosecutor
is gonna make

32:55.445 --> 32:58.446
your life a living hell
if you go with that story, pal.

33:02.151 --> 33:04.085
Fine.

33:04.120 --> 33:07.121
I admit it. I did it.

33:07.156 --> 33:09.790
I disposed of the body,
but I did not kill Hutch.

33:09.826 --> 33:12.526
Why would I?
Why? Because Hutch was gonna quit.

33:12.562 --> 33:14.084
Okay, and he wasn't following
your little party line.

33:14.109 --> 33:15.131
Please.

33:15.131 --> 33:17.598
There never was any party line.

33:17.634 --> 33:18.899
That was just a way
of making money.

33:18.935 --> 33:20.935
Hutch would have been
a damn Bolshevik

33:20.970 --> 33:22.270
if it paid well enough.

33:22.305 --> 33:23.604
So would I.
Oh, that gives you

33:23.640 --> 33:24.905
a good motive.

33:24.941 --> 33:26.607
You were going
to lose advertisers.

33:26.643 --> 33:29.043
So I'm guilty of being a
money-grubbing hypocrite.

33:29.078 --> 33:30.411
If that's against the law, then,

33:30.446 --> 33:32.213
throw me in jail,
throw away the key,

33:32.248 --> 33:34.782
but everything else
that I told you was the truth.

33:34.817 --> 33:37.051
After I got his message,
went to his house.

33:37.086 --> 33:38.586
Have it out with
him...<i> verbally.</i>

33:38.621 --> 33:40.788
But he wasn't there.

33:40.823 --> 33:42.189
So I called Miriam.

33:42.225 --> 33:43.958
Wait a second.
You talked to his wife?

33:43.993 --> 33:47.128
Yeah. She told me
about his other place.

33:47.163 --> 33:49.497
And that is where
I found him.

33:49.532 --> 33:51.799
Dead.

33:51.834 --> 33:56.804
Handcuffs, leather, ball gag.
It was revolting.

33:59.842 --> 34:00.841
I could not let the cops
Because it would have

34:00.877 --> 34:01.942
destroyed your station.

34:01.978 --> 34:04.111
Yeah.
BRENNAN: So you dressed him

34:04.147 --> 34:06.947
in his regular clothes and
took him to the storm drain.

34:06.983 --> 34:08.967
How was I supposed to know
that he wouldn't fit?

34:08.991 --> 34:09.985
Again,

34:09.985 --> 34:13.987
science and math would have
helped you a great deal.

34:20.330 --> 34:22.730
Okay, so the producer told us

34:22.764 --> 34:25.099
he threw these down
another storm drain.

34:25.134 --> 34:27.501
The good news is,
the bag was tied shut,

34:27.536 --> 34:29.837
so the evidence is pristine.

34:29.871 --> 34:31.339
There's lots of
blood on this stuff.

34:31.373 --> 34:32.973
Probably from Hutch,
but I can see

34:33.009 --> 34:34.809
if any of it came
from the killer.

34:34.844 --> 34:39.679
Oh, there's a shard of something
imbedded in the ball gag.

34:43.518 --> 34:46.587
May I?
Mm-hmm.

34:46.621 --> 34:50.123
It's a splinter from a fractured
upper left central incisor.

34:50.121 --> 34:52.047
Wow, it would have taken
a lot of force

34:52.072 --> 34:53.806
to break it off
and imbed it in the bone.

34:54.097 --> 34:56.897
More than a blow from a fist.
I believe so, yes.

34:56.933 --> 35:00.000
I am going to measure
the width of the shard,

35:00.036 --> 35:02.436
and perhaps we can build
a profile of the weapon.

35:02.472 --> 35:06.107
7.5 millimeters.

35:06.142 --> 35:08.242
And the ancillary fractures,

35:08.277 --> 35:11.779
I determined the length of what
struck him was 123 millimeters.

35:11.814 --> 35:14.181
So, he was hit
with something

35:14.217 --> 35:16.117
roughly the size
of a pack of cards?

35:16.152 --> 35:17.551
Let me see the tooth.

35:17.587 --> 35:20.321
Looks like there's some kind
of trace on it.

35:20.356 --> 35:21.956
(computer whirring and chirping)

35:21.991 --> 35:26.327
Yeah, there's, like, an
accumulation of textile fibers.

35:26.362 --> 35:29.563
Lint. It's simpler
to say "lint."

35:29.599 --> 35:31.298
Right. Okay, so we're looking
for something

35:31.334 --> 35:32.633
hard enough to crack bone,

35:32.668 --> 35:34.702
about the size
of a deck of cards,

35:34.737 --> 35:36.237
plus lint.
The killer

35:36.272 --> 35:38.506
could have been carrying
something in his pocket.

35:38.541 --> 35:41.609
A cell phone?

35:43.045 --> 35:44.979
MONTENEGRO:
<i>I was isolating</i>

35:45.014 --> 35:46.781
the ambient noise
on the voice mail,

35:46.816 --> 35:49.683
trying to figure out where Hutch
was when he placed this call.

35:49.719 --> 35:51.652
It wasn't his
S and M room?

35:51.687 --> 35:54.088
It should have been
to fit in with the timeline,

35:54.123 --> 35:55.890
but, no, it wasn't.

35:55.925 --> 35:58.959
I'm so impressed you were able
to pinpoint an exact location

35:58.961 --> 36:00.761
from a handful
disparate sounds

36:00.797 --> 36:03.357
Uh, actually,
I-I couldn't do that.

36:03.366 --> 36:04.732
Oh.

36:04.767 --> 36:06.200
No need to worry.

36:06.235 --> 36:08.536
You are still a valued
member of our team.

36:08.571 --> 36:10.638
I'm not finished yet, sweetie.

36:10.673 --> 36:12.473
A twist? Please continue.

36:12.508 --> 36:14.275
So, uh, I realized

36:14.310 --> 36:16.010
that I shouldn't
have been focusing

36:16.045 --> 36:19.079
on the background noise at all,
but rather, the message itself.

36:19.115 --> 36:20.481
Hmm.

36:20.516 --> 36:22.283
HUTCH:
Hey, Bob, it's Hutch.

36:22.318 --> 36:25.319
I'm not feeling too well,
so I won't be coming in.

36:25.354 --> 36:27.087
I'll call you later on.

36:27.123 --> 36:30.691
Now, listen to this sound file
that I pulled off Hutch's show.

36:30.726 --> 36:33.360
Hello, caller. This is Hutch.

36:33.396 --> 36:35.162
What's your question?

36:35.198 --> 36:37.932
Same person.
That's not a twist.

36:37.967 --> 36:39.467
Well, it's not
the same person.

36:39.502 --> 36:43.137
That <i> is</i> a twist.
Listen to this.

36:43.172 --> 36:45.639
MAN:
Hey, caller, let me tell you why

36:45.675 --> 36:48.742
the right is dead wrong
when it comes to guns.

36:48.778 --> 36:50.945
Well, that doesn't sound
anything like the victim.

36:50.980 --> 36:54.215
It's the victim's co-host,
Alan Spaziano.

36:54.250 --> 36:56.717
Now look what happens
when I run all three recordings

36:56.752 --> 36:59.954
through the voice
recognition software.

36:59.989 --> 37:01.589
So, I found clear deviations

37:01.624 --> 37:04.825
on the pitch and tone in
both of Hutch's voice files.

37:04.861 --> 37:06.327
But the pitch and tone were

37:06.362 --> 37:08.429
a perfect match
for Alan Spaziano.

37:08.464 --> 37:09.797
Spaziano pretended
to be Hutch

37:09.832 --> 37:11.232
in order to obfuscate
time of death?

37:11.267 --> 37:14.869
And to give himself
an airtight alibi.

37:18.088 --> 37:19.587
Uh, Bones, come on.

37:19.622 --> 37:20.966
Spaziano's waiting.
You ready to go in?

37:20.966 --> 37:21.718
I'm not going in.

37:21.742 --> 37:23.036
Whoa. What do you mean
you're not going in?

37:23.037 --> 37:24.771
You're not needed
at the lab, okay?

37:24.806 --> 37:26.439
You have everything
we need to nail him.

37:26.474 --> 37:27.807
I agree. I've gone over all

37:27.842 --> 37:29.475
the forensic evidence
with Agent Aubrey.

37:29.511 --> 37:31.944
Remember it's pronounced
"Albi-cans," not "kahn."

37:31.980 --> 37:32.986
What if I just say "thrush"?

37:33.010 --> 37:35.269
No, no. I will not have
my science dumbed down

37:35.283 --> 37:38.017
just because you don't
know Latin, is that clear?

37:38.052 --> 37:39.386
Excuse me for one second.
I need to talk to you.

37:39.410 --> 37:40.120
What?

37:40.121 --> 37:41.621
You're not a shrink, okay?

37:41.656 --> 37:43.656
Just stick to bones
and stuff that you know.

37:43.691 --> 37:45.391
I am using what
I know Booth.

37:45.427 --> 37:47.760
As an anthropologist, I
understand the danger inherent

37:47.796 --> 37:49.662
in making your
world too small.

37:49.697 --> 37:52.532
After times of national
trauma, many countries

37:52.567 --> 37:53.866
become isolationist.

37:53.902 --> 37:55.935
It happened in Japan
with the <i> sakoku</i> policy,

37:55.970 --> 37:57.603
the United States
after World War I.

37:57.639 --> 37:59.539
Would you stop? This is not
time for a history lesson.

37:59.574 --> 38:01.040
There is someone in there
we need to interrogate.

38:01.075 --> 38:02.341
Now let's...

38:02.377 --> 38:04.043
BRENNAN:
This is <i> precisely</i> the time.

38:04.078 --> 38:06.946
Those countries needed
time to rebuild,

38:06.981 --> 38:09.782
but then, eventually, they
had to reengage and recognize

38:09.818 --> 38:12.084
that they had allies
they could trust.

38:12.120 --> 38:16.322
You do, too. You can
trust him, Booth.

38:16.357 --> 38:19.525
I know a good man
when I see one.

38:21.095 --> 38:24.630
I picked you, didn't I?

38:27.001 --> 38:29.368
I'll meet you at home.

38:29.404 --> 38:31.938
(sighs)

38:34.676 --> 38:36.776
Yup, yup, I know.

38:36.811 --> 38:38.611
Back to my desk.

38:38.646 --> 38:42.281
Would you get your ass
in here, okay?

38:42.317 --> 38:44.684
What was it, uh, "kahn"?
Right? Is that what she said?

38:44.719 --> 38:47.553
No, cans, cans, cans, cans.
Cans.

38:47.589 --> 38:49.355
BOOTH: Look, we know that the
call from Hutch was

38:49.390 --> 38:50.957
actually you.
(laughs airily)

38:50.992 --> 38:52.425
I was just messing
with Bob.

38:52.460 --> 38:53.826
I mean, that's all.

38:53.862 --> 38:55.795
You can't arrest me
because I can do voices.

38:55.830 --> 38:58.431
True. That's why we
arrested you for murder.

38:58.466 --> 39:01.000
Why would I kill Hutch? Without
him, my career is finished.

39:01.035 --> 39:02.635
Well, I couldn't agree
with you more, right?

39:02.670 --> 39:04.303
Which is why you used
your cell phone to video

39:04.339 --> 39:05.905
Hutch in his S and M gear.
So you could

39:05.940 --> 39:07.340
blackmail him,
force him to stay on the show.

39:07.375 --> 39:08.641
What you didn't realize was

39:08.676 --> 39:10.810
the handcuffs had
a safety release.

39:10.845 --> 39:12.645
When Hutch saw you,
he freed himself and attacked.

39:12.680 --> 39:14.814
That's when you struck him in
the face with your cell phone,

39:14.849 --> 39:17.350
causing Hutch to drown
in his own blood.

39:17.385 --> 39:19.252
You have no proof of anything
you just said.

39:19.287 --> 39:20.987
BOOTH:
Oh, no. Actually, we do.

39:21.022 --> 39:22.989
Right? I mean, we found bacteria
on the victim's tooth

39:23.024 --> 39:24.524
that was transferred
from your phone.

39:24.559 --> 39:28.027
Disgusting fact-- cell
phones carry ten times

39:28.062 --> 39:29.362
more bacteria
than a toilet seat.

39:29.397 --> 39:31.097
Your wife is a
fountain of information.

39:31.132 --> 39:37.103
Yup. Among the bacteria we
found was one called <i> Candida</i>

39:37.138 --> 39:41.474
<i>albicans.</i> It causes
blotches on the gums.

39:41.509 --> 39:44.977
Look, all we got to do is just
swab your gums, match your DNA,

39:45.013 --> 39:46.946
and that's all
the proof we need.

39:54.689 --> 39:58.958
It was an accident.

39:58.993 --> 40:01.994
I didn't know
that he was going to attack me.

40:02.030 --> 40:03.996
I was trying to save my job.

40:04.032 --> 40:05.498
I'm not a violent person.

40:05.533 --> 40:06.999
I'm anti-guns.

40:07.035 --> 40:08.768
I'm against the death penalty.

40:08.803 --> 40:11.737
This is not who I am.

40:11.773 --> 40:13.272
It was an accident!

40:13.308 --> 40:14.774
(door opens)

40:14.809 --> 40:18.644
It was an...
it was an accident.

40:36.631 --> 40:38.864
♪ I got you... ♪

40:38.900 --> 40:40.833
BRENNAN:
<i>DNA is a match,</i>

40:40.868 --> 40:42.702
so conviction is assured.

40:42.737 --> 40:45.171
All right, so, since you
weren't in interrogation,

40:45.206 --> 40:47.807
you're not gonna get one of
these, I don't think, huh?

40:47.842 --> 40:51.143
Us sharing a celebratory drink
is never contingent

40:51.179 --> 40:53.446
on my presence
at time of arrest.

40:53.481 --> 40:55.648
Besides, I'm not sure you...

40:55.683 --> 40:57.216
I want whatever it is
you're making.

40:57.251 --> 40:58.651
Let me give you a little
taste. You're gonna love it.

40:58.686 --> 41:00.086
It's called a B&B.

41:00.121 --> 41:01.754
Oh. You named it after us?

41:01.789 --> 41:03.022
Beer and bourbon.

41:03.057 --> 41:04.757
I'm kidding.

41:04.792 --> 41:07.360
Just, go ahead, try it out.
You'll love it, all right?

41:07.395 --> 41:09.862
Just expand your world.

41:12.166 --> 41:13.726
That's excellent.
It's excellent, right?

41:13.735 --> 41:15.768
I-I mean, 'cause
it's got a little...

41:15.803 --> 41:17.470
It's got some
tequila in there.

41:17.505 --> 41:19.872
A little ginger beer, some
creme DE cassis. I mean,

41:19.907 --> 41:21.947
it's-it's a weird combination,
but it works somehow.

41:21.976 --> 41:23.542
Like us.

41:23.578 --> 41:26.145
Like us. Shake it, baby.

41:26.180 --> 41:27.813
(laughing)
(knocking)

41:27.849 --> 41:29.315
Are you expecting someone?

41:29.350 --> 41:30.816
No. Are you?

41:30.852 --> 41:33.686
No.

41:36.290 --> 41:39.592
Aubrey, come on in.
I come bearing gifts.

41:39.627 --> 41:42.395
Or <i> gift</i> actually.
I wasn't sure

41:42.430 --> 41:43.562
if you guys were
wine drinkers,

41:43.598 --> 41:46.032
but I, uh, just wanted
to say thanks

41:46.067 --> 41:48.367
to both of you
for letting me join the team.

41:48.403 --> 41:51.003
Uh, means a lot.
Look at that, huh?

41:51.039 --> 41:54.040
Wow, a whole $9.99 worth.

41:54.075 --> 41:55.608
Which is a lot
given his salary.

41:55.643 --> 41:57.243
Very understanding.

41:57.278 --> 41:58.944
Come on in, huh? I'll make
you a drink. Come on.

41:58.980 --> 42:00.346
I'm good. I'm good.

42:00.381 --> 42:02.261
Yeah, I can be obnoxious
when I drink, you know.

42:02.283 --> 42:04.483
Don't want to screw up
a good thing here, so,

42:04.519 --> 42:06.352
just gonna
take it slow.

42:06.387 --> 42:08.120
Yeah. See you tomorrow.

42:08.156 --> 42:09.655
Yeah. Tomorrow.

42:09.691 --> 42:11.557
BRENNAN:
Thank you.

42:11.592 --> 42:14.427
Good night.

42:14.462 --> 42:17.096
(door closes) You know what?
You were right about him.

42:17.131 --> 42:19.298
He was good.

42:19.333 --> 42:21.067
I mean, he <i> is</i> good.

42:21.102 --> 42:22.635
You know what he told me?

42:22.670 --> 42:24.770
He thinks you're the best
agent in the department.

42:24.806 --> 42:26.305
And I agreed with him.

42:26.340 --> 42:28.007
Oh, okay, so that's
how you want it now.

42:28.042 --> 42:30.309
I get it. You in the lab,
me out in the field with him.

42:30.344 --> 42:31.811
Was he that good?

42:31.846 --> 42:34.246
Yeah. You know
what? He <i> was</i> good.

42:34.282 --> 42:36.182
And of course,
I handpicked him.

42:36.217 --> 42:37.616
But we're still partners.

42:37.652 --> 42:40.453
You still need me, right?

42:40.488 --> 42:42.621
Oh, someone sounds
a little insecure.

42:43.279 --> 42:44.305
Are you teasing me?

42:44.305 --> 42:46.319
No. What? Am I? No.

42:46.320 --> 42:48.151
Stop, Booth. Just make me
another drink.

42:48.151 --> 42:50.752
Another drink?

42:50.787 --> 42:52.353
Stop, Booth!
Come on.
