02:06.054 --> 02:07.644
Who are you?

02:11.620 --> 02:13.878
Who are you?

02:45.591 --> 02:46.806
TOMIE VS. TOMIE

03:03.117 --> 03:05.460
It's been quite a while.

03:05.527 --> 03:07.456
How have you been feeling?

03:08.150 --> 03:10.544
Do you still have the dreams?

03:11.168 --> 03:13.580
I've been sleeping very well.

03:14.137 --> 03:17.000
I don't have bad dreams
like I used to.

03:17.881 --> 03:19.885
How about during the day?

03:19.988 --> 03:24.002
Do you ever feel anxious or dizzy?
Do your break out in cold dreams?

03:25.216 --> 03:26.587
No, not at all.

03:27.924 --> 03:30.217
Seems like you've gotten much better.

03:30.417 --> 03:31.687
What about your medicine?

03:31.987 --> 03:33.782
I haven't been taking it at all.

03:33.882 --> 03:35.453
I haven't needed it.

03:35.520 --> 03:39.471
Well, that's good.
And you look a lot healthier.

03:39.484 --> 03:40.857
Well...

03:42.238 --> 03:43.915
Actually...

03:45.348 --> 03:48.258
I was hoping to make
today my last session.

03:48.672 --> 03:50.392
Your last session?

03:50.792 --> 03:51.992
Yes.

03:52.461 --> 03:56.829
You've taken good care of me,
and I actually came today to thank you.

03:58.512 --> 04:03.084
I think I'm ready for a normal lifestyle.

04:04.125 --> 04:08.305
I've even found a job
through a friend of mine.

04:10.325 --> 04:11.125
But...

04:13.233 --> 04:19.966
I feel very calm.
I can't get back what I've lost.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.781
The only thing for me to do is
to accept that and move on.

04:26.893 --> 04:31.437
It's been half a year...
and that's how I feel.

04:31.794 --> 04:37.110
Mr. Umehara, it's great
that you feel that way.

04:37.631 --> 04:41.140
But the flashbacks always
return when you least expect them.

04:41.240 --> 04:43.818
You cannot underestimate
the severity of emotional scars.

04:43.915 --> 04:45.618
I understand.

04:46.638 --> 04:49.825
But, I'm really better.

04:56.645 --> 04:59.326
Thank you for everything.

05:08.048 --> 05:09.019
Drip.

05:09.620 --> 05:10.916
Drip drop.

05:11.016 --> 05:12.837
The sound of water.

05:13.137 --> 05:15.342
It's cold.
It's lonely.

05:15.871 --> 05:19.363
It's flawless.
There is no end.

05:19.626 --> 05:21.902
Red, red blood.

05:22.283 --> 05:24.937
For that girl to have been
killed right before your eyes!

07:05.035 --> 07:08.691
I'm sorry, the bouquet is a little small...

07:14.303 --> 07:17.678
I start work tomorrow.

07:18.119 --> 07:20.623
But no need to worry about me.

07:22.044 --> 07:26.161
Because we'll always
be together. Naoko.

07:44.074 --> 07:47.734
We build one body, create
a mold, and mass produce it.

07:47.834 --> 07:50.855
Then we finish with the
makeup in that other room.

07:51.005 --> 07:53.305
And if they want a wig, you give it a wig.

07:53.505 --> 07:55.293
How does that sound?
Pretty interesting, right?

07:56.031 --> 07:58.152
Yeah, it sounds like fun.

07:58.231 --> 08:01.818
This is the warehouse
where we ship them out.

08:02.629 --> 08:06.472
You have a lot of design experience,
so we'll eventually have you move to production.

08:07.157 --> 08:09.531
But for now, you've got to
build up your experience here.

08:11.062 --> 08:13.238
Oh, and also...

08:13.831 --> 08:16.681
Don't hang around the
facilities without permission.

08:17.027 --> 08:18.793
Understood.

08:19.582 --> 08:24.878
It's not like I don't trust you.
We've just got a lot of industry secrets.

08:25.700 --> 08:27.560
- Kishida!
- Yes!

08:28.442 --> 08:30.962
What are you doing here?

08:31.420 --> 08:34.504
Take him to assembly
and show him what to do.

08:34.703 --> 08:36.104
Yes, sir.

08:36.203 --> 08:39.179
This is Kishida.
He's also new here.

08:39.380 --> 08:42.601
You two get along now.
I'm counting on you.

09:07.510 --> 09:11.360
So... you want to start
cleaning these bodies?

09:31.134 --> 09:34.649
- Don't forget in between the fingers.
- Yup, got it!

09:36.118 --> 09:40.023
It's kind of hard if you do it like that.
Try taking the hand off.

09:40.921 --> 09:45.134
But remember to keep track of
which goes with which arm.

10:09.980 --> 10:10.690
Hey!

10:12.207 --> 10:13.898
Is he new?

10:14.332 --> 10:15.022
Yes.

10:16.123 --> 10:18.622
He seems like a serious guy.

10:19.441 --> 10:20.475
Really...

10:23.570 --> 10:26.427
Will you go check him out,
and then bring him up here?

10:28.668 --> 10:29.888
Here?

10:35.561 --> 10:36.961
I'm bored.

10:39.058 --> 10:41.723
I'm stuck up here all day waiting.

10:46.824 --> 10:47.724
Hey!

10:49.121 --> 10:51.328
What's happening
with that other thing?

10:52.614 --> 10:57.386
That... I haven't
found any clues.

10:57.925 --> 11:02.512
Please forgive me.
I really have been looking into it.

11:04.209 --> 11:08.874
You're always asking for forgiveness.
I'm so sick of it.

11:11.096 --> 11:13.866
I don't care what you
have to do find her!

11:57.726 --> 12:01.835
Hey, what are you doing?
Hurry up!

12:18.751 --> 12:21.572
Hurry up and cut me off!

12:22.264 --> 12:25.119
She's already done anyways.

12:26.366 --> 12:28.865
Cut me off and burn her!

12:36.987 --> 12:38.187
Hurry!

12:41.720 --> 12:43.158
Here we go, Tomie!

13:12.213 --> 13:17.808
Now all we need is her.
We need her blood.

13:19.730 --> 13:23.453
We're almost there, Tomie.

13:36.663 --> 13:40.620
Wow, look at that progress!

13:40.956 --> 13:47.194
You work hard, take orders, and don't complain. Umehara.
You're going straight to the top!

13:47.359 --> 13:52.009
Please, stop joking!
It's actually kind of relaxing.

13:52.234 --> 13:54.980
Suits my personality, I guess.

13:55.889 --> 13:58.036
We'll see...

14:00.451 --> 14:02.489
These guys are lucky...

14:02.966 --> 14:07.632
Even if they break, we just put
them back together, and they're all fixed.

14:09.081 --> 14:12.630
When living things die, that's it.

14:16.184 --> 14:21.656
Umehara, there are some things
I've got to tell you about this place.

14:22.262 --> 14:25.018
- About this factory?
- Yeah.

14:26.247 --> 14:30.965
There are still so many
things I've got to teach you.

14:36.533 --> 14:39.322
The boss here is never around.

14:40.724 --> 14:51.804
I hear he hides somewhere,
but nobody knows where.

14:51.839 --> 14:52.539
Yeah...

14:55.646 --> 14:58.374
Hey, when we finish
today, let's go out.

14:58.634 --> 15:01.078
I'll tell all the rumors
and stories about this place.

15:01.953 --> 15:05.999
Actually I can't today.
Mr. Fujita asked me stay late.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.838
The factory boss?

15:10.075 --> 15:14.535
I'm not sure why.
He said he wanted to introduce me to someone.

15:15.806 --> 15:18.239
Do you know who that might be?

15:18.815 --> 15:20.089
Oh...

15:23.136 --> 15:25.165
Is something wrong?

15:25.596 --> 15:32.219
Uh... I guess I'll just have to tell
you those stories another time then!

15:32.881 --> 15:35.290
Good luck with that!

16:13.585 --> 16:15.541
Is there something wrong?

16:15.992 --> 16:18.632
Uh, nothing.

16:19.520 --> 16:23.723
Mr. Fujita, who am I going to meet?

16:27.980 --> 16:30.802
I guess you could say
the real head of this factory.

16:31.284 --> 16:36.874
Someone who's
been asking to meet you.

16:37.564 --> 16:38.792
Oh...

17:24.933 --> 17:26.393
This person?

17:27.030 --> 17:32.288
He's an employee. The best of the best.

17:35.594 --> 17:38.461
So, come on in.

18:08.790 --> 18:11.068
So, do you like it here?

18:19.770 --> 18:24.120
I've been watching
you this whole time...

18:24.920 --> 18:28.142
...Mr. Kazuki Umehara.

18:41.841 --> 18:43.125
Naoko...

18:45.702 --> 18:47.458
I'm Tomie.

18:49.220 --> 18:50.963
Tomie...

19:01.120 --> 19:06.346
Hey, what's wrong?

19:09.350 --> 19:11.298
Look at me.

19:12.750 --> 19:14.625
What is this?

19:16.110 --> 19:18.026
They...

19:20.042 --> 19:21.943
They like me.

19:23.979 --> 19:26.546
That's why they come to see me.

19:28.914 --> 19:32.343
I'd like it if you'd come to see me too.

19:35.560 --> 19:37.894
Are you shy?

19:43.100 --> 19:48.894
To be honest... some
bad people are after me.

19:51.730 --> 19:55.757
I need someone who will protect me.

20:00.500 --> 20:01.900
That's why...

20:10.580 --> 20:16.201
You're strange.
Look me in the eye.

20:26.120 --> 20:28.804
So we can be alone...

20:30.270 --> 20:33.351
...in my room-

20:39.509 --> 20:45.474
Mr. Fujita. I don't know what
this is about, but I'm leaving.

20:45.875 --> 20:46.588
Wait!

21:02.610 --> 21:05.257
That boy is unbelievable!

21:06.680 --> 21:08.475
Why?

21:09.760 --> 21:14.080
I can't believe him either!
To act like that in front of you!

21:14.650 --> 21:20.195
It's because you two were here!
Bring him here again.

21:21.198 --> 21:22.025
Yes.

21:28.760 --> 21:33.759
And, what's is going on
with that girl, Mr. Fujita?

21:35.170 --> 21:36.775
Please forgive me.

21:39.380 --> 21:41.964
I know, I deserve it...

21:43.690 --> 21:46.420
I'll give you exactly what you want.

22:02.495 --> 22:04.653
That's enough!

22:07.040 --> 22:08.841
Tomie...

22:13.565 --> 22:15.310
Tomie...

22:16.150 --> 22:21.507
Find that girl, even if it kills you.

23:18.889 --> 23:21.646
Hurry...

23:23.854 --> 23:26.332
I've got to hurry...

25:07.767 --> 25:08.667
Naoko!

25:08.767 --> 25:11.167
Help!

25:41.716 --> 25:43.147
Naoko...

26:30.460 --> 26:32.136
What is it?

26:32.970 --> 26:39.000
Umehara, why don't you take a break? It's break time.

26:43.520 --> 26:47.097
It's okay, I'm not tired.

26:50.060 --> 26:53.586
That's what I like about you!

26:54.980 --> 26:59.612
So, how was yesterday?
You met with her, right?

27:01.380 --> 27:04.171
You know her?

27:06.480 --> 27:08.748
Well, kind of...

27:13.900 --> 27:18.689
- Did Fujita ask you to get me to see her again?
- Don't get me wrong.

27:19.270 --> 27:21.176
I'm not like them.

27:23.890 --> 27:34.177
Fujita, and that man, they're crazy!
That's what I wanted to tell you yesterday.

27:34.750 --> 27:36.255
They're crazy?

27:36.710 --> 27:38.784
Don't you think?

27:39.350 --> 27:43.753
They keep her trapped up in that
building and play around with her.

27:43.853 --> 27:45.645
I don't see it like that.

27:45.745 --> 27:48.532
It's obvious!

27:49.040 --> 27:52.613
She's forced to play queen up there.

27:54.450 --> 27:56.428
Tomie...

27:56.810 --> 28:01.916
She's become a toy for them.
They're messing around with her.

28:02.520 --> 28:05.155
It's not fair to her, it's pitiful.

28:07.310 --> 28:09.479
Umehara...

28:11.130 --> 28:17.712
Let's go and save her.
We'll do it together.

28:20.420 --> 28:23.182
Please do it by yourself.

29:17.710 --> 29:18.998
Where am I?

29:20.000 --> 29:22.102
My room.

29:24.260 --> 29:27.507
Were we a little too rough?

29:30.280 --> 29:35.393
But, I'm glad...

29:37.543 --> 29:40.184
Because now we're alone.

29:53.140 --> 29:57.696
When you're cold like that, it makes
me want to know you even more.

30:00.839 --> 30:04.336
I've been thinking about this for a while.

30:04.943 --> 30:09.259
I thought guys were all the same, and stupid.

30:10.760 --> 30:15.856
But, you seem to be different.

30:23.336 --> 30:24.556
Why is that?

30:30.550 --> 30:33.314
Say something!

30:34.590 --> 30:36.791
Do you really hate me that much?

30:41.110 --> 30:43.789
Then what do you think of me?

30:46.100 --> 30:51.894
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

30:56.970 --> 30:59.932
I can't leave here.

31:01.042 --> 31:03.575
I'm trapped here by those men...

31:05.054 --> 31:07.271
...played around with, like a toy.

31:09.110 --> 31:11.923
And I'm breaking...

31:14.512 --> 31:16.428
I'm falling apart...

31:16.770 --> 31:19.947
I'm going to disappear soon...

31:21.561 --> 31:23.766
It's like I'm cursed.

31:32.200 --> 31:38.235
Please get me out of here!
I beg you! Please help me!

31:42.160 --> 31:44.781
I don't understand you.

31:51.990 --> 31:54.507
Mr. Umehara...

31:57.380 --> 32:00.770
Your girlfriend died, right?

32:02.880 --> 32:06.058
You really can't forget her?

32:07.252 --> 32:09.250
How do you know?

32:11.940 --> 32:13.987
I feel bad for you.

32:17.796 --> 32:20.222
It must have been hard.

32:29.310 --> 32:32.574
I'll take her place.

32:37.370 --> 32:45.876
Think of me as if I were her.
I beg you.

32:59.706 --> 33:01.158
Kazuki...

33:03.760 --> 33:05.392
Stop it!

33:38.762 --> 33:41.384
Please, leave me alone.

33:45.660 --> 33:51.360
No one has ever
embarassed me like this before.

33:55.520 --> 34:00.022
You know how fickle Tomie is.

34:00.700 --> 34:03.705
She's infatuated with him right now.

34:03.960 --> 34:07.860
She'll betray you
two and run away with him.

34:09.070 --> 34:13.062
Nonsense.
Stop accusing her.

34:13.650 --> 34:18.471
The way she acted yesterday...
What the hell was that?

34:18.739 --> 34:21.945
She treats you like garbage.

34:22.429 --> 34:27.306
Or, does that make you happy?

34:27.429 --> 34:30.735
Where is the girl?
Tell me now!

34:31.268 --> 34:34.534
You save her over and over again,
again with no reward.

34:36.091 --> 34:42.750
You're not even allowed
to touch her pinky, right?

34:43.380 --> 34:48.793
Liar! You don't know her,
do you? What are you?

34:51.810 --> 34:55.882
Hey, Umehara. That was fast.

34:58.800 --> 35:00.259
Did it go well?

35:05.780 --> 35:10.896
You took him to her?
To get rid of us?

35:12.460 --> 35:14.719
What are you planning to do?

35:16.520 --> 35:20.722
I would never be able to stand it.

35:21.700 --> 35:25.747
I'd rather kill Tomie
than give her to him.

35:27.490 --> 35:32.676
I know that what you two
really want is to kill Tomie!

35:36.430 --> 35:41.142
You die.
Kill him.

35:44.793 --> 35:46.436
What's wrong?

35:48.460 --> 35:50.016
Hurry up and do it!

36:40.945 --> 36:45.025
What happened to your face?

36:45.140 --> 36:50.036
Nothing. Don't worry about it,
everything is going well.

36:50.639 --> 36:52.577
There won't be any problems.

36:53.461 --> 36:58.249
You're not betraying me, are you?

36:59.580 --> 37:02.639
Why would you even say that!

37:04.530 --> 37:10.310
You sure you're not on her side,
becoming one of her pawns?

37:13.310 --> 37:15.489
How can you doubt me?

37:16.360 --> 37:21.698
I love you so much, so why
don't you believe me, Tomie?

37:22.250 --> 37:24.546
Then what are you waiting for?

37:26.380 --> 37:30.187
You're going to abandon
me and leave me to die?

37:33.438 --> 37:39.763
I can't go back to
the way I used to be.

38:01.115 --> 38:02.232
Tomie...

38:04.803 --> 38:08.730
I can't wait any longer.

38:54.440 --> 38:56.656
There was
something wrong with me.

38:58.420 --> 39:00.539
Naoko, you're here.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.315
I'm sorry.

39:23.090 --> 39:26.849
You would never betray me!
You're always with me!

39:38.430 --> 39:40.867
I won't go back there again!

39:43.100 --> 39:46.830
It will always be
two of us. Naoko!

40:28.440 --> 40:32.101
Just when I thought it
was finally getting better...

40:33.310 --> 40:35.966
I thought I was better...

40:43.750 --> 40:46.184
Naoko is suffering.

40:48.654 --> 40:52.070
So I'm suffering too.

41:02.000 --> 41:06.816
Something is always getting in between us.

41:11.090 --> 41:18.046
I'm really wanted to keep the
promise I made to Naoko, but...

41:22.304 --> 41:23.550
Always...

41:32.870 --> 41:37.744
Mr. Umehara, you've got a pure heart.

41:39.310 --> 41:43.097
I understand your feelings toward Naoko.

41:43.580 --> 41:47.788
But I want you to think about it again.

41:52.150 --> 41:55.417
What really happened six moths ago?

41:56.040 --> 41:58.807
Did Naoko really die?

42:00.630 --> 42:03.407
Even you don't believe me now!

42:04.440 --> 42:06.360
Are you saying I'm lying?

42:07.057 --> 42:13.803
I'm not saying that at all.
I believe your heart is telling you the truth. But...

42:14.110 --> 42:19.318
Naoko wasn't killed?
That it never happened?

42:19.960 --> 42:22.198
That's what you're trying to say, right?

42:22.830 --> 42:25.458
Then where did Naoko disappear to?

42:32.530 --> 42:34.713
I'm not crazy.

42:38.750 --> 42:40.821
You are all crazy!

42:49.686 --> 42:55.151
I'm sorry. I'm a little confused right now.

43:08.390 --> 43:13.503
That person, he's not here, right?

43:15.077 --> 43:16.428
Yes.

43:20.626 --> 43:23.171
What do you want me to do?

43:26.170 --> 43:28.509
Shall I take care of him?

43:30.200 --> 43:31.840
And the man who calls a shore farmland.

43:34.940 --> 43:36.020
That guy also disappaered.

43:38.140 --> 43:40.359
You let him go?

43:41.880 --> 43:45.291
What will happen if he lets
that girl do whatever she wants?

43:49.477 --> 43:52.062
Useless...

43:53.660 --> 43:55.835
I can't stay here anymore.

43:57.860 --> 43:58.937
Right?

44:02.020 --> 44:04.581
You can say whatever you want.

44:07.287 --> 44:09.108
Just...

44:10.620 --> 44:13.220
...don't betray me.

44:57.760 --> 44:59.339
Hey, you.

45:04.590 --> 45:08.820
Looks like you're getting
along well with the girl.

45:11.890 --> 45:16.015
She looks like exactly
like that girl that died.

45:17.280 --> 45:20.621
It's almost like she's come back from grave.

45:22.680 --> 45:27.203
But, those girls are poorly made.

45:27.500 --> 45:30.384
So it will be over soon.

45:31.900 --> 45:37.267
The magic will eventually wear off.
That's how it is.

45:39.830 --> 45:43.995
What are you talking about?
Who are you?

45:46.110 --> 45:50.639
You don't remember this face?

45:57.010 --> 45:59.822
There's no way you
don't know me, Umehara!

46:00.727 --> 46:02.609
Where's Tomie?

46:03.810 --> 46:07.147
Let go of me!
You're crazy!

46:07.480 --> 46:10.244
Has she gotten to you too?

46:10.900 --> 46:14.846
Is she good enough for you?
Open your eyes!

47:27.292 --> 47:29.026
What's going on?

47:30.910 --> 47:33.043
It's a fire! We've got to get out!

47:33.490 --> 47:35.736
What?
Get out of my way!

47:53.910 --> 47:55.366
You two!

47:56.663 --> 48:02.383
Finally I get to meet you.
One Tomie is more than enough!

48:05.758 --> 48:06.718
Wait!

48:24.219 --> 48:25.973
Where are you?

48:30.730 --> 48:33.139
What are you doing?

48:33.339 --> 48:35.246
Die!

48:39.516 --> 48:41.280
Go to hell!

49:08.865 --> 49:10.401
Tomie...

49:25.520 --> 49:28.703
There's no point
in running, Miss Tomie.

49:44.860 --> 49:47.142
So, we finally meet.

49:48.210 --> 49:50.519
Thanks for coming.
You've saved me some trouble.

49:51.019 --> 49:56.927
Well you're coming on awfully strong.
You can't even do anything without those idiotic men.

49:57.570 --> 50:00.313
But it's over now.

50:01.790 --> 50:05.119
This, coming from a rat like you.

50:08.050 --> 50:11.764
I'm going to pay you back
for everything you've done.

50:12.850 --> 50:14.851
That's my line.

50:16.740 --> 50:19.203
What do you really want?

50:20.150 --> 50:23.473
I just hate you.
That's all.

50:27.530 --> 50:32.858
Is you blood... clean?

50:33.950 --> 50:35.841
Are you really Tomie?

50:36.430 --> 50:39.164
If you're just a fake,
what am I going to do?

50:58.525 --> 51:00.777
I'm going to take your blood!

51:12.368 --> 51:15.248
- I finally caught you!
- Let me go!

51:15.448 --> 51:16.320
Tomie!

51:54.240 --> 51:55.003
Let's go!

52:01.560 --> 52:03.771
- Why'd you come back?
- I don't know.

52:25.567 --> 52:26.964
Umehara!

52:28.736 --> 52:31.266
I will not let you take Tomie!

52:41.470 --> 52:42.463
Tomie!

52:51.601 --> 52:52.602
Die!

52:57.318 --> 52:59.300
Idiot!

53:30.120 --> 53:31.410
I found you!

53:42.673 --> 53:43.972
I'm over here!

53:47.471 --> 53:49.261
What is this, hide-and-seek?

54:09.480 --> 54:10.841
Where are you?

54:12.260 --> 54:14.101
Come out!

54:48.422 --> 54:50.793
Stop!
What are you doing?

55:00.870 --> 55:03.493
You're going to
die, so I'll tell you.

55:05.540 --> 55:08.691
We were both
wasting out time.

55:10.320 --> 55:12.855
I'm the same as you.

55:14.590 --> 55:17.217
My blood isn't pure either.

55:18.955 --> 55:21.622
There's human blood mixed in.

55:22.610 --> 55:24.700
I'm a fake.

55:25.166 --> 55:27.819
Then you're doomed too!

55:30.181 --> 55:34.149
But, I will find it.

55:36.820 --> 55:40.862
Real, new, immortal blood.

55:42.110 --> 55:45.275
Let me out!
Get me out of here!

55:47.860 --> 55:49.207
Goodbye.

55:55.351 --> 55:59.144
No!

56:55.800 --> 56:58.021
They're both death.

56:59.430 --> 57:01.055
What about that girl?

57:08.370 --> 57:12.385
Tomie!

57:17.720 --> 57:19.250
Let's get out of here.

57:29.470 --> 57:31.558
Why did you save me?

57:33.555 --> 57:35.931
I thought you didn't like me.

57:41.594 --> 57:43.681
Did you change your mind?

57:52.810 --> 57:55.130
You won't even talk to me.

57:59.189 --> 58:01.589
I don't know what to say...

58:04.560 --> 58:07.560
It feels like I'm in a dream.

58:12.210 --> 58:14.692
There's no turning back now.

58:19.637 --> 58:21.745
You've become involved...

58:25.358 --> 58:26.938
...with me...

58:36.130 --> 58:37.110
Come in...

58:46.020 --> 58:47.491
Sit over there.

59:00.580 --> 59:03.565
We'll have to clean your wound.

59:04.720 --> 59:05.635
It's fine.

59:11.633 --> 59:13.290
What is that?

59:33.750 --> 59:37.155
I doesn't matter what I do!
It's all over!

59:38.760 --> 59:39.720
Tomie.

59:54.926 --> 59:56.225
Kazuki...

01:00:10.198 --> 01:00:12.901
You're so hard to understand.

01:00:14.850 --> 01:00:18.287
I don't know if
you're cold or warm.

01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:24.290
What do you think of me?

01:00:26.248 --> 01:00:27.989
What do you want to do?

01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:33.446
Are you only doing this
because you feel sorry for me?

01:00:34.146 --> 01:00:34.946
No.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.118
I'm scared.

01:00:41.710 --> 01:00:43.675
I have to find her...

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:48.600
...the real me...

01:00:51.967 --> 01:00:54.011
...or I'll die.

01:01:09.506 --> 01:01:11.178
Help me.

01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:35.650
But you belong to me!

01:01:39.023 --> 01:01:43.061
You promised we
would be together forever!

01:01:48.834 --> 01:01:51.670
You're betraying me!

01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:56.110
Kazuki!

01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:40.760
<i>You're in a very bad situation.</i>

01:02:44.128 --> 01:02:48.248
<i>You're with that girl, right?</i>

01:02:51.932 --> 01:02:54.214
<i>I'll let you see Naoko.</i>

01:02:55.890 --> 01:02:57.799
Naoko is dead!

01:03:00.209 --> 01:03:04.765
<i>Now I get it.
Naoko died.</i>

01:03:05.175 --> 01:03:07.288
<i>I'll be waiting at your special place.</i>

01:03:07.690 --> 01:03:09.611
You're the one who killed Naoko!?

01:03:54.446 --> 01:03:55.743
Kazuki.

01:04:04.424 --> 01:04:07.071
Do you think I
could pass for her?

01:04:12.025 --> 01:04:13.718
Take that dress off!

01:04:17.110 --> 01:04:18.320
Get out of here!

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.639
So she was killed!

01:04:21.970 --> 01:04:24.931
- And that's why you wouldn't take me!
- Stop it!

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:29.975
- But she's just like me!
- Don't mess with my emotions!

01:04:30.570 --> 01:04:32.145
She's not dead!

01:04:33.131 --> 01:04:35.995
She can't be dead!
Where is she?

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:40.666
- This has nothing to do with you!
- Yes it does! I've been looking for her!

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:44.524
There is no time, where is she?

01:06:01.259 --> 01:06:06.393
How long will
this dream go on?

01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:13.308
It won't end until you die.

01:07:11.452 --> 01:07:13.983
- You brought me here for this?!
- Stop!

01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:35.604
What's this about?

01:07:37.542 --> 01:07:39.205
Who are you?

01:07:41.806 --> 01:07:45.182
Let me help you remember.

01:07:45.282 --> 01:07:47.322
Where's Naoko?!

01:07:49.050 --> 01:07:53.449
We'll bring her back, the three of us.

01:07:55.657 --> 01:07:57.136
The tree of us?

01:08:06.410 --> 01:08:11.412
This is where she was killed.

01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:15.851
But no one would believe you.

01:08:19.022 --> 01:08:23.666
Don't worry though.
I believe you.

01:08:24.529 --> 01:08:26.182
That's cause you killed her!

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:27.720
Yes.

01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:31.187
I killed her.

01:08:32.647 --> 01:08:36.353
Many, many times.

01:08:38.974 --> 01:08:40.354
I strangled her.

01:08:42.014 --> 01:08:43.511
I stabbed her.

01:08:45.279 --> 01:08:47.340
I cut her up into tiny pieces.

01:08:49.716 --> 01:08:52.585
But she kept coming back to life.

01:08:54.711 --> 01:08:58.381
She played with my heart so many times.

01:08:59.711 --> 01:09:03.756
I would love her... and kill her.

01:09:04.569 --> 01:09:08.198
Love her... and kill her.

01:09:08.317 --> 01:09:12.189
Love her, kill her.
Love her, kill her.

01:09:12.921 --> 01:09:14.881
I even burned her.

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:25.812
But she still came back.

01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:33.362
Every time, just as beautiful.

01:09:35.893 --> 01:09:37.703
She's a monster!

01:09:44.451 --> 01:09:48.752
A long time ago, I
thought up this experiment.

01:09:49.779 --> 01:09:55.120
I was a doctor back then, and
wanted to create babies like her.

01:09:56.498 --> 01:10:03.193
I took her blood, and injected
it into several other babies.

01:10:07.551 --> 01:10:16.740
And as I predicted,
those girls grew up to be her.

01:10:23.273 --> 01:10:30.215
Those girls filled the world, and one
man after another fall in love with them.

01:10:31.203 --> 01:10:33.611
It must have been fun.

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:41.563
I bet you had a lot of
fun too, but it's over now.

01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:48.041
You're a fake.
You're polluted with human blood.

01:10:48.543 --> 01:10:51.292
And your body is
breaking down faster and faster.

01:10:51.392 --> 01:10:55.125
That's why you're looking
for new blood-- her blood.

01:10:57.820 --> 01:10:59.113
Am I wrong?

01:11:00.759 --> 01:11:07.759
You were mortal replicas of her,
showing your ugliness and then rotting away...

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:10.679
It was wonderful.

01:11:13.930 --> 01:11:15.801
Now there's only one you left.

01:11:18.166 --> 01:11:23.261
I've been watching
you this whole time, Tomie.

01:11:26.958 --> 01:11:31.571
Umehara, you too.

01:11:32.782 --> 01:11:35.955
A few years ago,
that girl disappeared.

01:11:36.355 --> 01:11:43.044
I looked for her, and found out that
she had taken you, I tried to get her back.

01:11:43.144 --> 01:11:48.258
You noticed me, and became afraid and jealous.
She fueled your jealousy.

01:11:48.358 --> 01:11:51.587
And then she was killed...

01:11:53.937 --> 01:11:55.053
Here...

01:11:56.903 --> 01:11:58.198
...and her murderer...

01:11:59.384 --> 01:12:01.097
...was you.

01:12:07.048 --> 01:12:08.417
That's a lie!

01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:15.239
You refuse to face realty.

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:17.739
The memory rewrited you.

01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:21.140
Exhanged memory with that monster.

01:12:22.824 --> 01:12:26.423
You created new memories with that
monster, and forgot about all the sufffering.

01:12:28.146 --> 01:12:31.766
And then, she disappeared.

01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:37.363
She's always been by your side.
I'm convinced of it!

01:12:39.816 --> 01:12:42.221
Was that Naoko?

01:12:44.072 --> 01:12:45.825
It's Tomie.

01:12:47.323 --> 01:12:49.162
The real one.

01:12:52.496 --> 01:12:57.083
She was Naoko to you.

01:13:03.050 --> 01:13:05.367
Are you done with your story now?

01:13:08.025 --> 01:13:11.901
Unless Naoko appears here,
now your story is meaningless!

01:13:12.495 --> 01:13:14.973
It's all in your head!

01:13:16.691 --> 01:13:18.762
I will not let you get
away with this again!

01:13:37.611 --> 01:13:39.111
Tomie.

01:13:45.070 --> 01:13:50.952
Tomie, please come out!

01:13:54.478 --> 01:13:56.923
I want to see you again!

01:14:00.486 --> 01:14:02.267
I love you!

01:14:05.496 --> 01:14:07.534
Tomie!

01:14:08.650 --> 01:14:12.564
Tomie isn't here!
It's all just an illusion!

01:14:33.086 --> 01:14:34.533
Tomie...

01:14:43.627 --> 01:14:45.910
Stand back!

01:14:47.371 --> 01:14:49.271
Hurry!

01:15:23.872 --> 01:15:25.072
Tomie...

01:15:39.364 --> 01:15:42.369
I wanted to be with you longer.

01:15:46.359 --> 01:15:49.743
For you to
remember me like this...

01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:56.257
But it's all over!

01:16:00.054 --> 01:16:01.882
I'll be waiting for you in Hell!

01:16:05.732 --> 01:16:06.737
Stop!

01:16:46.839 --> 01:16:48.763
Kazuki...

01:16:51.865 --> 01:16:54.255
Tomie!

01:18:48.387 --> 01:18:49.674
Naoko...

01:18:55.779 --> 01:18:57.064
I promise...

01:19:07.124 --> 01:19:09.859
...we'll always be together.

01:19:15.431 --> 01:19:16.925
...always...

01:21:13.392 --> 01:21:15.830
Tomie...

01:21:45.041 --> 01:21:47.724
I'm sorry...

01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:52.883
...Naoko...

01:21:58.497 --> 01:22:00.875
I'm Tomie.

01:22:03.806 --> 01:22:09.466
I've always been with you.

01:22:13.997 --> 01:22:16.223
Together...

01:22:51.972 --> 01:22:53.787
Together...

01:22:55.582 --> 01:22:57.464
...forever.
