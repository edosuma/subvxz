00:57.224 --> 00:58.559
Well...

00:58.600 --> 01:01.770
if it isn't my good friend,
The Poet.

01:01.812 --> 01:05.065
I can't say I'm surprised
to find you here.

01:05.107 --> 01:08.026
Whose grave are
you visiting today?

01:08.068 --> 01:09.278
Who's there?

01:09.319 --> 01:12.364
Weeping at the same
grave over again?

01:12.406 --> 01:15.617
Why didn't you choose
any of the others?

01:15.659 --> 01:18.912
Ligeia, Annabel?

01:18.954 --> 01:21.707
Or perhaps Berenice?

01:21.748 --> 01:24.459
So sure Virginia
was going to be the pick

01:24.501 --> 01:27.671
for today's tortured journey.

01:27.713 --> 01:31.383
There's no denying
your affection for her.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.885
What was that poem of yours?

01:33.927 --> 01:36.972
"It was many and many a year ago

01:37.014 --> 01:40.392
"That a maiden there lived
whom you may know

01:40.434 --> 01:43.895
"And this maiden she lived
with no other thought...

01:43.937 --> 01:46.481
"Than to love and
be loved by me."

01:46.523 --> 01:48.191
What am I doing?

01:48.233 --> 01:50.736
I recite poetry with a statue!

01:50.777 --> 01:52.613
I must be drunk.

01:52.654 --> 01:53.780
<i>Or mad.</i>

01:53.822 --> 01:56.199
Or both.

01:56.241 --> 01:57.701
I am hallucinating.

01:57.743 --> 02:02.039
Should I answer this one
with another of your stanzas?

02:02.080 --> 02:04.416
"All that we see or seem

02:04.458 --> 02:08.336
"ls but a dream
within a dream..."

02:17.304 --> 02:20.599
Still you have no
clue to who I am.

02:20.641 --> 02:23.101
I am your shadow, your soul.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.562
The object of your obsession.

02:25.604 --> 02:26.855
Are you mad?

02:26.897 --> 02:28.940
My obsession?

02:28.982 --> 02:35.781
Recognize me now, Poe?

02:35.822 --> 02:38.200
Are you feeling lonely?

02:38.241 --> 02:40.869
Longing again for the departed?

02:40.911 --> 02:42.663
Silence!

02:42.704 --> 02:45.040
I came here for solitude.

02:45.082 --> 02:46.583
Not loneliness.

02:46.625 --> 02:49.920
Always obsessed with the dead.

02:49.961 --> 02:52.422
A great subject
for your writings.

02:52.464 --> 02:54.257
It is not obsession

02:54.299 --> 02:57.552
but rather inspiration
which drives my writing.

02:57.594 --> 02:59.763
I wouldn't define it that way.

02:59.805 --> 03:02.516
Remember Roderick Usher?

03:02.557 --> 03:06.812
His compulsive obsession for
his departed sister Madeline

03:06.853 --> 03:08.689
caused such a nervous agitation

03:08.730 --> 03:12.359
that it lead him
to an early demise.

03:12.401 --> 03:15.404
It was brotherly love, not
obsession.

03:15.445 --> 03:18.240
Obsession, superstition,

03:18.281 --> 03:20.784
unrequited love.

03:20.826 --> 03:24.413
Who do you want to convince?

04:20.135 --> 04:23.013
It was a magical place
that filled my childhood

04:23.054 --> 04:27.392
with visions
to stir the imagination.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.787
And now, during the whole

04:46.828 --> 04:48.789
of a dull, dark,
and soundless day

04:48.830 --> 04:51.416
in the autumn of another year,

04:51.458 --> 04:54.377
I was alone, passing through

04:54.419 --> 04:57.297
a singularly dreary
tract of country;

04:57.339 --> 05:00.175
and at length found myself

05:00.217 --> 05:09.810
within reach of the
melancholy House of Usher.

05:09.851 --> 05:13.647
I know not how it was;
but with my first glimpse

05:13.688 --> 05:16.483
of the house after so long,

05:16.525 --> 05:20.487
an unexpected sense
of insufferable gloom

05:20.529 --> 05:23.031
pervaded my spirit.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.242
What was it?

05:25.283 --> 05:27.661
What unnerved me so

05:27.702 --> 05:32.082
in the contemplation
of the House of Usher?

05:32.123 --> 05:34.960
Its proprietor, Roderick Usher,

05:35.001 --> 05:39.214
had been one of my boon
companions in boyhood;

05:39.256 --> 05:46.137
but many years had elapsed
since our last meeting.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.681
His letter, however,

05:47.722 --> 05:50.642
had lately reached me
in a distant part

05:50.684 --> 05:55.438
of the country.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.275
I scanned more narrowly

05:58.316 --> 06:00.986
the real aspect of the building.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.238
Its principal feature

06:03.280 --> 06:08.618
seemed to be that
of an excessive antiquity.

06:14.291 --> 06:18.378
The writer spoke of
acute bodily illness,

06:18.420 --> 06:20.630
of a mental disorder
which oppressed him,

06:20.672 --> 06:24.551
and brought an
earnest desire to see me,

06:24.593 --> 06:27.178
as his best,
and indeed his only

06:27.220 --> 06:29.598
personal friend, in an attempt

06:29.639 --> 06:31.683
to alleviate some of his malady;

06:31.725 --> 06:33.768
and I, accordingly,

06:33.810 --> 06:34.936
obeyed forthwith

06:34.978 --> 06:38.773
what I still considered
a very singular

06:38.815 --> 06:42.027
and haunting summons.

07:08.136 --> 07:16.186
I gazed upon him with a feeling
half of pity, half of awe.

07:16.227 --> 07:17.646
Frederick!

07:17.687 --> 07:19.606
My dear friend,

07:19.648 --> 07:22.108
I have after all this time

07:22.150 --> 07:29.157
been waiting for your arrival!

07:29.199 --> 07:32.035
I at first thought it to be

07:32.077 --> 07:34.663
an overdone cordiality.

07:34.704 --> 07:37.040
It was with difficulty
that I could bring myself

07:37.082 --> 07:40.752
to admit the identity of
the man being before me

07:40.794 --> 07:45.882
with the companion
of my early boyhood.

07:45.924 --> 07:48.009
He entered into what
he conceived to be

07:48.051 --> 07:51.429
the nature of his malady.

07:51.471 --> 07:59.604
The most insipid food
was alone endurable.

07:59.646 --> 08:03.441
The odors of all flowers
proved oppressive;

08:03.483 --> 08:08.780
his eyes were tortured
by even a faint light.

08:17.288 --> 08:19.541
And there were but
peculiar sounds

08:19.582 --> 08:22.877
which inspired him with horror.

09:01.166 --> 09:04.252
I began to question
my worthiness

09:04.294 --> 09:06.254
of being present for my friend,

09:06.296 --> 09:14.679
who now existed in a world
of which I held no key.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.223
I shall perish!

09:17.265 --> 09:21.478
I dread the events
of the future!

09:21.519 --> 09:24.230
I feel that the period
will sooner or later arrive

09:24.272 --> 09:25.523
when I must abandon

09:25.565 --> 09:29.110
life and reason together,

09:29.152 --> 09:31.613
in some struggle

09:31.654 --> 09:37.035
with the grim phantasm...

09:37.077 --> 09:38.995
...fear.

09:39.037 --> 09:41.581
But what do you fear, Roderick?

09:41.623 --> 09:44.042
I must know what
is it that torments

09:44.084 --> 09:46.002
your every moment.

09:46.044 --> 09:47.212
I admit that

09:47.253 --> 09:51.591
much of the peculiar gloom which
afflicts me could be traced

09:51.633 --> 09:57.514
to a severe
and long continued illness.

09:57.555 --> 10:05.105
I speak of my tenderly
beloved sister, Madeline.

10:05.146 --> 10:10.902
My sole companion
for so many long years,

10:10.944 --> 10:11.694
my last

10:11.736 --> 10:16.616
and only relative on earth.

10:16.658 --> 10:19.536
Roderick spoke with
such bitterness,

10:19.577 --> 10:21.996
which made me shudder.

10:22.038 --> 10:24.165
And yet, I could tell

10:24.207 --> 10:29.462
of his complete devotion
towards his sister.

10:29.504 --> 10:31.381
Madeline...

10:31.422 --> 10:33.591
Her decease

10:33.633 --> 10:37.303
will leave me as the last

10:37.345 --> 10:44.185
of the ancient
race of the Ushers.

10:44.227 --> 10:46.437
His voice trembled

10:46.479 --> 10:49.649
as he recounted how even in
her youth, Madeline would fear

10:49.691 --> 10:52.360
the outside world.

10:52.402 --> 10:56.322
Roderick loved his sister
for her purity,

10:56.364 --> 11:00.994
but the foreboding doom
was forever present.

11:01.035 --> 11:10.670
The Usher's life of loneliness
will mean there will be no heir.

11:10.712 --> 11:13.840
But on the closing in
of the evening of my arrival

11:13.882 --> 11:15.925
at the house,

11:15.967 --> 11:19.345
she succumbed
to the prostrating power

11:19.387 --> 11:22.223
of the destroyer.

11:32.817 --> 11:36.654
She is dead!

11:36.696 --> 11:41.576
Madeline has died!

11:41.618 --> 11:45.330
She has left me!

12:06.517 --> 12:09.395
At the request of
Roderick Usher,

12:09.437 --> 12:11.231
I personally aided him

12:11.272 --> 12:16.027
in the arrangements
for the temporary entombment.

12:49.852 --> 12:50.812
And now,

12:50.853 --> 12:56.317
some days of bitter grief
having elapsed,

12:56.359 --> 12:57.860
an observable change

12:57.902 --> 13:04.367
came over the features of the
mental disorder of my friend.

13:15.795 --> 13:20.300
At times, again, I was
obliged to resolve all

13:20.341 --> 13:26.306
into the mere inexplicable
vagaries of madness.

13:42.572 --> 13:45.033
For I beheld him
gazing upon vacancy

13:45.074 --> 13:46.784
for long hours,

13:46.826 --> 13:49.537
in an attitude
of the profoundest attention,

13:49.579 --> 13:55.376
as if listening to some
imaginary sound.

14:03.051 --> 14:04.010
It was no wonder

14:04.052 --> 14:07.305
that his terrifying condition
was creeping upon me,

14:07.347 --> 14:10.308
the wild influence
of his fantastic

14:10.350 --> 14:13.936
yet impressive superstitions.

14:26.991 --> 14:31.412
And you have not seen it?

14:31.454 --> 14:35.458
Then you shall!

14:35.500 --> 14:37.794
You must!

14:37.835 --> 14:41.297
You must behold this!

14:48.846 --> 14:55.311
I hear it, and have heard it.

14:55.353 --> 14:58.064
We have put her

14:58.106 --> 15:00.316
living

15:00.358 --> 15:07.615
in the tomb!

15:07.657 --> 15:10.243
I now tell you

15:10.284 --> 15:11.661
that I heard

15:11.702 --> 15:15.456
her first feeble movements

15:15.498 --> 15:18.084
in the hollow coffin.

15:18.126 --> 15:20.837
I heard them many,
many days ago.

15:20.878 --> 15:22.463
Yet I dared not,

15:22.505 --> 15:26.884
I dared not speak!

15:26.926 --> 15:29.595
The rending of her coffin,

15:29.637 --> 15:34.058
and the grating of the
iron hinges of her prison,

15:34.100 --> 15:36.644
and her struggles

15:36.686 --> 15:38.062
within the coppered

15:38.104 --> 15:42.275
archway of the vault!

15:49.157 --> 15:50.491
Be calm.

15:50.533 --> 15:53.494
It is the storm
that draws breath,

15:53.536 --> 15:58.332
playing tricks on us both!

15:58.374 --> 16:03.379
Is she not hurrying
to upbraid me for my haste?

16:03.421 --> 16:08.009
Have I not heard
her footsteps on the stairs?

16:08.050 --> 16:10.136
Do I not distinguish that heavy

16:10.178 --> 16:11.679
and horrible

16:11.721 --> 16:13.681
beating

16:13.723 --> 16:19.479
of her heart?

16:19.520 --> 16:21.481
Madman!

16:21.522 --> 16:24.525
MADMAN!

16:34.952 --> 16:40.666
I tell you that she now
stands without the door!

16:53.804 --> 16:57.808
The vision before
me will stay burnt

16:57.850 --> 17:00.728
into my very soul and haunt me

17:00.770 --> 17:04.022
to the end of my days.

17:53.239 --> 17:55.116
Where I gazed,

17:55.157 --> 17:57.827
the House once stood.

17:57.868 --> 18:00.079
I saw the mighty walls rushing

18:00.121 --> 18:04.625
as under there was a long
tumultuous shouting sound,

18:04.667 --> 18:07.878
like the voice of
a thousand waters

18:07.920 --> 18:12.592
and the deep and
dank tarn at my feet

18:12.633 --> 18:17.305
closed sullenly and silently

18:17.346 --> 18:23.352
over the fragments
of the House of Usher.

18:31.152 --> 18:32.820
Bravo!

18:32.862 --> 18:36.032
In your own words he became
a victim of the very terrors

18:36.073 --> 18:37.325
he had anticipated.

18:37.366 --> 18:41.203
Much like you.

18:41.245 --> 18:43.331
Don't you wish you were dead?

18:43.372 --> 18:46.292
Why should I? I want to live.

18:46.334 --> 18:48.919
I have more stories to tell.

18:48.961 --> 18:52.214
Your time is up in your world.
You have nothing to lose,

18:52.256 --> 18:54.675
no one to love.

18:54.717 --> 18:57.637
Stop feeling guilty
for other people's death.

18:57.678 --> 19:01.057
Virginia died in spite
of your care or your love.

19:01.098 --> 19:03.434
Your mother succumbed
to my power

19:03.476 --> 19:09.148
leaving you helplessly alone.

19:09.190 --> 19:12.068
I was so young when she died...

19:12.109 --> 19:15.029
I was denied even the
memory of her face.

19:15.071 --> 19:17.239
Guilt never leads to any good.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.283
If anything you are haunted...

19:19.325 --> 19:21.369
Haunted by sorrow,

19:21.410 --> 19:28.709
guilty not of a crime, but of
the inability to stop me...

19:28.751 --> 19:30.211
If anything, I am guilty of

19:30.252 --> 19:32.171
giving my readers
what they want.

19:32.213 --> 19:34.382
A glimpse of redemption,

19:34.423 --> 19:44.350
stories with a moral
where justice always triumphs.

19:44.392 --> 19:47.186
Is this what you mean?

21:33.125 --> 21:37.463
It is impossible to say how
first the idea entered my brain;

21:37.505 --> 21:39.590
but once conceived,

21:39.632 --> 21:42.551
it haunted me day and night.

21:42.593 --> 21:43.928
Object,

21:43.969 --> 21:45.221
there was none,

21:45.262 --> 21:46.764
I loved the old man.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.767
He had never wronged me.
He had never given me insult,

21:49.809 --> 21:51.310
and for his money,

21:51.352 --> 21:54.063
I had no desire.

21:54.104 --> 21:55.022
I think

21:55.064 --> 21:58.359
it was his eye!

21:58.400 --> 22:02.238
Yes, that was it!

22:02.279 --> 22:06.116
One of his eyes resembled
that of a vulture.

22:06.158 --> 22:08.202
I made up my mind

22:08.244 --> 22:12.248
to take the life of the old man,

22:12.289 --> 22:17.670
and thus rid myself
of the eye forever.

22:17.711 --> 22:20.965
You should have seen
how wisely I proceeded,

22:21.006 --> 22:24.635
with what caution and foresight
I went to work.

22:24.677 --> 22:28.180
And every night, about midnight,

22:28.222 --> 22:33.352
I turned the latch of
his door and opened it.

22:33.394 --> 22:36.897
And then, when my
head was well in the room,

22:36.939 --> 22:39.567
I undid the lantern cautiously,

22:39.608 --> 22:42.653
oh, so cautiously.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.530
I undid it just so much

22:44.572 --> 22:48.909
that a single thin ray
fell upon the vulture eye.

22:48.951 --> 22:53.038
But I found the
eye always closed;

22:53.080 --> 22:54.623
and so

22:54.665 --> 22:55.791
it was impossible

22:55.833 --> 22:59.211
to do the work;

22:59.253 --> 23:02.631
for it was not the old man
who vexed me,

23:02.673 --> 23:05.759
but his Evil Eye.

23:05.801 --> 23:08.846
I was never kinder
to the old man than during

23:08.888 --> 23:15.853
the whole week
before I killed him.

23:15.895 --> 23:19.273
And this I did for
seven long nights.

23:19.315 --> 23:25.321
Every night, just at midnight.

23:25.362 --> 23:32.244
But I found the
eye always closed.

23:32.286 --> 23:34.038
Upon the eighth night

23:34.079 --> 23:38.375
I was more than usually cautious
in opening the door.

23:38.417 --> 23:43.881
A watch's minute hand moves
more quickly than did mine.

23:43.923 --> 23:46.258
When I was about to
open the lantern,

23:46.300 --> 23:51.388
my thumb slipped
upon the tin fastening.

23:51.430 --> 23:54.600
And the old man sprang up in bed

23:54.642 --> 23:57.144
crying out: Who's there?

23:57.186 --> 24:00.606
He had been trying
to fancy them causeless.

24:00.648 --> 24:02.650
He had been saying to himself:

24:02.691 --> 24:05.694
"it is nothing
but the wind in the chimney.

24:05.736 --> 24:08.489
It is only a mouse
crossing the floor."

24:08.530 --> 24:11.951
But all in vain...

24:16.121 --> 24:18.832
Then, there came to my ears

24:18.874 --> 24:20.209
a low, dull, quick sound

24:20.250 --> 24:23.504
such as the watch makes
when enveloped in cotton.

24:23.545 --> 24:25.089
I knew that sound well.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.298
It was the beating

24:26.340 --> 24:30.177
of the old man's heart.

24:36.809 --> 24:40.062
Meantime the hellish tattoo
of the heart increased.

24:40.104 --> 24:42.147
It grew quicker and quicker,

24:42.189 --> 24:48.946
louder and louder,
every instant.

24:48.988 --> 24:54.076
The old man's hour had come!

24:54.118 --> 24:58.622
He shrieked once, only once.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.798
The old man was dead.

25:07.840 --> 25:12.761
His eye would
trouble me no more.

25:12.803 --> 25:15.764
If still you think me mad,

25:15.806 --> 25:18.434
you will think so no longer

25:18.475 --> 25:20.352
when I describe

25:20.394 --> 25:23.981
the wise precautions I took
for the concealment of the body.

25:24.023 --> 25:26.108
First of all I
dismembered the corpse,

25:26.150 --> 25:28.944
I then took up three planks
from the flooring

25:28.986 --> 25:34.450
and deposited all
between the scantlings.

25:34.491 --> 25:39.246
I then replaced the boards
so cleverly, so cunningly,

25:39.288 --> 25:48.922
that no human eye could have
detected anything wrong.

25:48.964 --> 25:51.592
There entered three men,
who introduced themselves

25:51.633 --> 25:53.135
as officers of the police.

25:53.177 --> 25:56.138
A shriek had been heard by
a neighbor during the night

25:56.180 --> 25:58.849
and they had been deputed
to search the premises.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.934
I bid the gentleman welcome.

26:00.976 --> 26:05.439
The shriek, I said,
was my own in a dream.

26:05.481 --> 26:07.649
The old man, I mentioned,

26:07.691 --> 26:12.946
was absent in the country.

26:12.988 --> 26:15.657
The officers were satisfied,

26:15.699 --> 26:18.077
my manner had convinced them.

26:18.118 --> 26:20.621
But, ere long,

26:20.662 --> 26:25.501
I felt myself getting pale

26:25.542 --> 26:32.466
and wished them gone.

26:32.508 --> 26:34.218
My head ached

26:34.259 --> 26:39.389
and I fancied a
ringing in my ears.

26:51.610 --> 26:57.407
I found that the noise
was not within my ears.

27:01.787 --> 27:04.081
I gasped for breath,

27:04.123 --> 27:06.542
and yet the officers

27:06.583 --> 27:08.252
heard it not.

27:08.293 --> 27:16.760
Why would they not be gone?

27:16.802 --> 27:17.928
Oh God!

27:17.970 --> 27:20.639
What could I do?

27:20.681 --> 27:24.852
Was it possible they heard not?

27:24.893 --> 27:26.812
No!... No!

27:26.854 --> 27:28.605
They heard;

27:28.647 --> 27:32.401
they suspected!

27:32.442 --> 27:34.903
THEY KNEW!

27:34.945 --> 27:37.072
They were making mockery

27:37.114 --> 27:42.286
of my horror.

27:42.327 --> 27:43.871
"Villains!"

27:43.912 --> 27:49.209
I shrieked, "I admit the deed!

27:49.251 --> 27:52.462
"Tear up the planks!

27:52.504 --> 27:54.506
"Here,

27:54.548 --> 27:58.510
"here!

27:58.552 --> 28:02.639
"It is the beating

28:02.681 --> 28:08.562
"of his hideous heart!"

28:24.620 --> 28:26.496
So you presume
everyone is guilty

28:26.538 --> 28:28.832
of some unfathomable crime?

28:28.874 --> 28:31.752
A crime that should
remain unpunished?

28:31.793 --> 28:33.253
I feel flattered.

28:33.295 --> 28:37.633
Your obsession with death is to
my ears like a sweet love song.

28:37.674 --> 28:43.222
What do you mean, obsession?

28:43.263 --> 28:44.431
Come with me,

28:44.473 --> 28:46.725
don't delay for another second.

28:46.767 --> 28:50.938
Being alive in this world
brings you more unbearable pain

28:50.979 --> 28:54.107
and suffering than those
who wish to sleep forever

28:54.149 --> 28:56.568
even as you try to extend life

28:56.610 --> 29:03.325
beyond my sweet embrace.

29:03.367 --> 29:06.870
I remember vaguely,
once I wrote about a doctor.

29:06.912 --> 29:09.581
Someone who challenged you.

30:31.705 --> 30:34.041
My attention, for
the last three years,

30:34.082 --> 30:38.795
had been repeatedly drawn
to the subject of Mesmerism.

30:47.596 --> 30:50.682
In Boston, a 13-year-old
child under hypnosis

30:50.724 --> 30:52.642
could diagnose his own illness,

30:52.684 --> 30:55.354
one which his own doctors
could not determine.

30:55.395 --> 30:57.647
And in India, a paraplegic,

30:57.689 --> 30:59.775
placed in a similar
hypnotic state,

30:59.816 --> 31:01.485
managed to take some steps!

31:01.526 --> 31:03.028
Imagine, Mr. Valdemar,

31:03.070 --> 31:06.073
the progress that Mesmerism
offers to science!

31:06.114 --> 31:08.784
My friend,
I respect your enthusiasm,

31:08.825 --> 31:10.994
but for my part, I can't disavow

31:11.036 --> 31:14.414
my skepticism
about the future of hypnosis.

31:14.456 --> 31:21.421
Our table is waiting for
us at the Black Swan.

31:21.463 --> 31:23.548
In addition, it
seems that no person

31:23.590 --> 31:26.635
has as yet been mesmerized
in articulo mortis.

31:26.676 --> 31:29.429
What a great testimony
will that be,

31:29.471 --> 31:33.266
witnessing the transition
between life and death.

31:33.308 --> 31:37.396
My friend, if you promise
to change the subject,

31:37.437 --> 31:39.231
I am ready to volunteer myself

31:39.272 --> 31:42.067
to this experiment
at the time of my death.

31:42.109 --> 31:43.610
Really?

31:57.624 --> 31:59.292
Yes, but rest assured,

31:59.334 --> 32:03.463
I have no intention
of dying anytime soon!

32:17.018 --> 32:19.146
It is now rather more
than seven months

32:19.187 --> 32:26.361
since last time I talked
with M. Valdemar.

32:26.403 --> 32:29.573
Phthisis has attacked my lungs.

32:29.614 --> 32:36.788
They give me a few
months at most.

32:36.830 --> 32:40.125
M. Valdemar,
do you remember your promise?

32:40.167 --> 32:42.794
I beg your pardon?

32:42.836 --> 32:45.255
Yes, the idea may seem absurd,

32:45.297 --> 32:48.967
but think of all you
have to gain now.

32:49.009 --> 32:50.510
No...

32:50.552 --> 32:53.305
I don't know.

32:53.346 --> 32:59.144
Allow me to consider it.

32:59.186 --> 33:01.771
Valdemar, you are condemned.

33:01.813 --> 33:04.024
You have no family or home.

33:04.065 --> 33:06.401
What have you to lose?

33:06.443 --> 33:09.112
Promise me you will
think about it.

33:09.154 --> 33:11.114
Very well,

33:11.156 --> 33:18.955
lam in your hands.

33:18.997 --> 33:22.792
It was finally arranged between
us that he would send for me

33:22.834 --> 33:25.045
about twenty-four
hours before the period

33:25.086 --> 33:27.088
announced by his physicians

33:27.130 --> 33:30.759
as that of his decease.

33:30.800 --> 33:33.261
I received this note
within half an hour

33:33.303 --> 33:36.139
after it was written,
and in fifteen minutes more,

33:36.181 --> 33:41.186
I was in the dying
man's chamber.

33:41.228 --> 33:43.563
It was about five
minutes to eight when,

33:43.605 --> 33:44.689
taking the patient's hand,

33:44.731 --> 33:47.526
I begged him to state
as distinctly as he could

33:47.567 --> 33:49.986
to Dr. I whether he
was entirely willing

33:50.028 --> 33:53.949
that I should make the
experiment of mesmerizing him

33:53.990 --> 33:58.745
in his then condition.

33:58.787 --> 34:03.542
Yes, I wish to be mesmerized.

34:03.583 --> 34:08.213
I fear you have
deferred it too long.

34:27.482 --> 34:29.525
At five minutes before eleven,

34:29.568 --> 34:34.155
I perceived unequivocal signs
of the mesmeric influence.

34:41.621 --> 34:44.833
When I had accomplished this,
it was fully midnight,

34:44.873 --> 34:46.960
and I requested the
gentlemen present

34:47.002 --> 34:50.297
to examine
M. Valdemar's condition.

34:50.338 --> 34:52.132
The patient's extremities

34:52.172 --> 34:57.887
were of an icy coldness.

34:57.929 --> 35:04.686
Still, the general appearance
was not that of death.

35:04.728 --> 35:06.521
Monsieur Valdemar,

35:06.563 --> 35:10.442
are you asleep?

35:10.483 --> 35:12.444
Yes,

35:12.485 --> 35:17.073
I am asleep now.

35:17.115 --> 35:21.703
Do not wake me!

35:21.745 --> 35:30.462
Let me die so!

35:30.503 --> 35:33.173
It was now the opinion,
or rather the wish,

35:33.214 --> 35:34.382
of the physicians,

35:34.424 --> 35:37.844
that M. Valdemar should be
suffered to remain undisturbed

35:37.886 --> 35:40.889
in his present apparently
tranquil condition,

35:40.930 --> 35:43.391
until death should supervene,

35:43.433 --> 35:45.727
and this,
it was now generally agreed,

35:45.769 --> 35:48.563
must take place
within a few minutes.

35:48.605 --> 35:51.149
I concluded, however,
to speak to him

35:51.191 --> 35:53.610
once more.

35:53.652 --> 35:59.240
Monsieur Valdemar,
do you still sleep?

35:59.282 --> 36:00.533
Yes,

36:00.575 --> 36:01.618
<i>“O.</i>

36:01.660 --> 36:03.578
I have been sleeping

36:03.620 --> 36:04.996
and now...

36:05.038 --> 36:08.583
Now...

36:16.883 --> 36:26.059
I am dead.

36:26.101 --> 36:29.104
It was evident that,
so far, death,

36:29.145 --> 36:31.022
or what is usually termed death,

36:31.064 --> 36:35.944
had been arrested
by the mesmeric process.

36:35.985 --> 36:37.779
The experiment is completed.

36:37.821 --> 36:41.783
But... are we sure he's dead?

36:41.825 --> 36:44.035
You've heard it like me, right?

36:44.077 --> 36:46.121
Is your scientific mind
restricted

36:46.162 --> 36:51.793
by that which you can only see
or hear yourself?

36:51.835 --> 36:54.754
From this period
until the close of last week,

36:54.796 --> 36:57.590
an interval of
nearly seven months,

36:57.632 --> 37:02.554
we continued to make daily calls
at M. Valdemar's house.

37:02.595 --> 37:05.890
I managed to convince my
colleagues to leave M. Valdemar

37:05.932 --> 37:08.852
in this state and
to monitor him.

37:16.025 --> 37:20.280
First, we confined ourselves
to simple daily observations.

37:20.321 --> 37:24.284
But soon, we were obliged
to face the facts.

37:24.325 --> 37:26.953
Gentlemen,
we are not advancing our work.

37:26.995 --> 37:31.207
These observations
are too superficial.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.209
You still wish to
dissect the subject

37:33.251 --> 37:34.961
like a laboratory animal.

37:35.003 --> 37:36.963
Without going that far,

37:37.005 --> 37:39.674
we can engage in
some light tests.

37:39.716 --> 37:41.301
You are mistaken! I...

37:41.342 --> 37:44.095
What are you suggesting, Dr. L?

37:44.137 --> 37:46.431
Well, we could always...

37:46.473 --> 37:49.142
let it be.

38:38.691 --> 38:40.777
There is nothing further
to be done.

38:40.819 --> 38:43.780
All of the subject's vital
functions are inert.

38:43.822 --> 38:47.617
He has stopped breathing, his
heart no longer beats, yet...

38:47.659 --> 38:51.162
in seven months, decomposition
has not attacked his body

38:51.204 --> 38:53.665
and no treatment has
cured his illness.

38:53.706 --> 38:57.293
Medically, M. Valdemar is dead.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.087
Let's wake him up.

38:59.128 --> 39:00.880
You're talking nonsense!

39:00.922 --> 39:04.509
These thoughts are sacrilege!
Insanity!

39:04.551 --> 39:06.886
You would not agree
to put him in this state

39:06.928 --> 39:09.347
and now you refuse
to release him from it?

39:09.389 --> 39:11.015
'III

39:11.057 --> 39:14.227
Let it go my friend,
Dr. P is right.

39:14.269 --> 39:16.688
M. Valdemar is legally dead.

39:16.729 --> 39:22.026
All we can do now
is to offer him a decent burial.

39:25.405 --> 39:28.074
It was on Friday last
that we finally resolved

39:28.116 --> 39:30.326
to make the experiment
of awakening,

39:30.368 --> 39:33.705
or attempting to awaken him.

39:33.746 --> 39:35.957
For the purpose of
relieving M. Valdemar

39:35.999 --> 39:37.625
from the mesmeric trance,

39:37.667 --> 39:40.420
I made use of the
customary passes.

39:40.461 --> 39:45.717
These, for a time,
were unsuccessful.

39:45.758 --> 39:48.011
M. Valdemar,

39:48.052 --> 39:53.099
can you explain to us what your
feelings or wishes are now?

39:53.141 --> 39:54.851
For God's sake!

39:54.893 --> 39:56.603
Quick! Quick!

39:56.644 --> 39:57.937
Put me to sleep!

39:57.979 --> 40:00.231
Or Waken me! Quick!

40:00.273 --> 40:03.109
I say to you that I am dead!

40:03.151 --> 40:05.028
Dead!

40:05.069 --> 40:08.364
Dead!!!

40:20.418 --> 40:22.545
For what really
occurred, however,

40:22.587 --> 40:25.131
it is quite impossible
that any living human

40:25.173 --> 40:28.426
could have been prepared.

40:43.733 --> 40:46.152
And as I can see, he lost...

40:46.194 --> 40:50.406
lost to me.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.492
He was so close...

40:52.533 --> 40:56.955
so close to sparing M. Valdemar
from your fatal embrace.

40:56.996 --> 40:59.207
Was that a crime?

40:59.248 --> 41:01.501
A crime against fate.

41:01.542 --> 41:06.714
And your sentence
was a life of endless sorrow.

41:06.756 --> 41:09.467
Stop with your
tortured mind games.

41:09.509 --> 41:13.262
There is nothing worse than
imagining your own death.

41:13.304 --> 41:14.222
Isn't it?

41:14.263 --> 41:18.017
Nothing worse than
to fear eternity.

41:18.059 --> 41:20.019
I wrote a story once.

41:20.061 --> 41:22.188
A tale about someone
who relived the hell

41:22.230 --> 41:24.691
of dying a thousand deaths.

41:24.732 --> 41:27.777
Perhaps a mirror where you
saw yourself reflected,

41:27.819 --> 41:29.153
every image

41:29.195 --> 41:32.115
a different death.

42:38.264 --> 42:42.727
I was sick...

42:42.769 --> 42:46.481
sick to death with
that long agony.

42:46.522 --> 42:50.860
And when they unbound me, I felt
that my senses were leaving me.

42:59.577 --> 43:01.204
The sentence...

43:01.245 --> 43:03.206
the dread sentence of death...

43:03.247 --> 43:05.458
was the last of
distinct accentuation

43:05.500 --> 43:08.753
which reached my ears.

43:08.795 --> 43:10.338
After that,

43:10.379 --> 43:14.133
the sound of the inquisitorial
voices seemed merged

43:14.175 --> 43:23.684
into one dreamy
indeterminate hum.

43:23.726 --> 43:25.603
I heard no more.

43:25.645 --> 43:26.938
Yet, for a while,

43:26.979 --> 43:30.108
I saw the lips of the judges.

43:30.149 --> 43:35.321
I saw them pronouncing
the syllables of my name,

43:35.363 --> 43:40.785
and I shuddered
because I heard no sound.

44:00.471 --> 44:04.392
The tall candles sank
into nothingness;

44:04.433 --> 44:06.644
their flames went out.

44:06.686 --> 44:11.440
The blackness of darkness
supervened.

44:11.482 --> 44:12.733
All sensations appeared

44:12.775 --> 44:16.404
swallowed up in a mad
rushing descent as of the soul

44:16.445 --> 44:18.990
into Hades.

44:19.031 --> 44:22.994
Then silence, and stillness,

44:23.035 --> 44:25.997
night were the universe.

45:03.367 --> 45:08.831
After this I call to mind
flatness and dampness;

45:08.873 --> 45:10.791
and then all the
madness of a memory

45:10.833 --> 45:18.174
which busies itself
among forbidden things.

45:18.216 --> 45:21.636
So far, I had not
opened my eyes.

45:21.677 --> 45:29.810
I dreaded the first glance
at objects around me.

45:29.852 --> 45:33.689
My worst thoughts, then,
were confirmed.

45:33.731 --> 45:40.863
The blackness of eternal night
encompassed me.

45:40.905 --> 45:43.032
I struggled for breath.

45:43.074 --> 45:47.453
The atmosphere was
intolerably close.

45:47.495 --> 45:48.621
But where

45:48.663 --> 45:52.458
and in what state was I?

45:52.500 --> 45:54.502
The condemned to death, I knew,

45:54.543 --> 45:57.255
perished usually
at the autos-da-fe,

45:57.296 --> 45:59.131
and one of
these had been held

45:59.173 --> 46:03.552
on the very night
of the day of my trial.

46:03.594 --> 46:06.013
Had I been remanded
to my dungeon,

46:06.055 --> 46:08.891
to await the next
sacrifice, which

46:08.933 --> 46:12.853
would not take
place for many months?

46:22.113 --> 46:23.447
And now,

46:23.489 --> 46:26.200
there came thronging
upon my recollection

46:26.242 --> 46:30.955
a thousand vague rumors
of the horrors of Toledo.

46:30.997 --> 46:32.081
Of the dungeons

46:32.123 --> 46:35.251
there had been
strange things narrated,

46:35.293 --> 46:39.088
strange, and too
ghastly to repeat.

46:53.060 --> 46:54.854
Was I left to
perish of starvation

46:54.895 --> 46:58.566
in this subterranean
world of darkness;

46:58.607 --> 47:02.570
or what fate,
perhaps even more fearful,

47:02.611 --> 47:04.488
awaited me?

47:24.175 --> 47:26.594
My outstretched hands at length

47:26.635 --> 47:30.056
encountered some solid
obstruction.

47:30.097 --> 47:31.599
It was a wall,

47:31.640 --> 47:34.602
I followed it up.

47:34.643 --> 47:38.939
This process, however,
afforded me no means

47:38.981 --> 47:43.736
of ascertaining
the dimensions of my dungeon.

48:34.412 --> 48:36.664
Another step before my fall,

48:36.705 --> 48:40.709
and the world had
seen me no more.

48:54.557 --> 48:56.308
And the death just avoided,

48:56.350 --> 48:59.061
was of that very character
which I had regarded

48:59.103 --> 49:01.647
as fabulous and frivolous

49:01.689 --> 49:05.901
in the tales regarding
the Inquisition.

49:14.326 --> 49:16.287
To the victims of its tyranny,

49:16.328 --> 49:18.247
there was the choice of death

49:18.289 --> 49:20.666
with its direst physical
agonies,

49:20.708 --> 49:25.588
or death with its most hideous
moral horrors.

49:25.629 --> 49:29.425
I had been reserved
for the latter.

49:42.271 --> 49:44.857
I was consumed with
intolerable thirst.

49:44.899 --> 49:48.527
This thirst it appeared to be
the design of my persecutors

49:48.569 --> 49:50.029
to stimulate:

49:50.070 --> 49:52.573
for the food in
the dish was meat

49:52.615 --> 49:54.366
pungently seasoned.

50:01.457 --> 50:03.000
It must have been drugged;

50:03.042 --> 50:06.378
for scarcely had I drunk,

50:06.420 --> 50:10.174
before I became
irresistibly drowsy.

50:25.314 --> 50:26.357
I could no longer doubt

50:26.398 --> 50:30.319
the doom prepared for me
by monkish ingenuity in torture.

50:30.361 --> 50:32.821
My cognizance of the pit
had become known

50:32.863 --> 50:35.199
to the inquisitorial.

50:35.241 --> 50:36.867
Having failed to fall,

50:36.909 --> 50:38.786
it was no part of the demon plan

50:38.827 --> 50:40.871
to hurl me into the abyss,

50:40.913 --> 50:45.501
and thus a different and a
milder destruction awaited me.

51:15.114 --> 51:19.618
I counted the rushing
vibrations of the steel!

51:19.660 --> 51:21.495
Inch by inch...

51:21.537 --> 51:23.622
line by line...

51:23.664 --> 51:30.254
with a descent only appreciable
at intervals that seemed ages.

51:39.680 --> 51:42.725
Down... steadily down it crept.

51:42.766 --> 51:47.313
Down... certainly,
relentlessly down!

51:47.354 --> 51:51.442
It vibrated within three inches
of my bosom!

52:02.328 --> 52:05.372
I prayed for its
more speedy descent.

52:05.414 --> 52:07.499
I grew frantically mad,
and struggled

52:07.541 --> 52:09.418
to force myself upward

52:09.460 --> 52:13.339
against the sweep
of the fearful scimitar.

53:11.855 --> 53:13.941
For the moment, at least,

53:13.982 --> 53:15.859
I was free.

53:15.901 --> 53:24.618
Free! And in the grasp
of the Inquisition!

53:24.660 --> 53:25.911
Free!

53:25.953 --> 53:27.871
I had but escaped death

53:27.913 --> 53:29.790
in one form of agony,

53:29.832 --> 53:34.837
to be delivered unto worse
than death in some other.

53:40.300 --> 53:42.386
For a wild moment,

53:42.428 --> 53:43.554
did my spirit refuse

53:43.595 --> 53:49.518
to comprehend the meaning
of what I saw.

53:49.560 --> 53:52.312
Any horror but this!

53:52.354 --> 53:55.482
Any death but that of the pit!

53:55.524 --> 53:58.110
Might I have not known
that into the pit

53:58.152 --> 54:01.572
it was the object
of the burning iron to urge me?

54:01.613 --> 54:06.076
Could I resist its glow?

54:17.337 --> 54:20.758
There was a discordant hum
of human voices!

54:20.799 --> 54:23.844
There was a loud blast.

54:23.886 --> 54:27.848
The French army
had entered Toledo.

54:27.890 --> 54:33.437
The Inquisition was in
the hands of its enemies.

54:40.861 --> 54:45.783
You have devoted
so many pages to my name,

54:45.824 --> 54:48.786
caressing my face
with your poems,

54:48.827 --> 54:51.872
kissing my lips with your prose.

54:51.914 --> 54:57.795
All veiled love letters
addressed to me.

55:01.882 --> 55:03.509
You fear me

55:03.550 --> 55:07.221
and yet you are
insatiably attracted.

55:07.262 --> 55:11.391
Come with me. It's time.

55:11.433 --> 55:15.729
No, it cannot be.
I don't want to be forgotten.

55:15.771 --> 55:17.689
I was buried in a common grave.

55:17.731 --> 55:22.361
My writings were
forgotten for years.

55:22.402 --> 55:24.655
You are already dead.

55:24.696 --> 55:28.242
How could you remember
your own death...

55:28.283 --> 55:33.914
unless you have succumbed
to my embrace?

55:33.956 --> 55:36.583
Your life is not
worth living anymore.

55:36.625 --> 55:37.668
It is time

55:37.709 --> 55:39.378
to meet your own ghosts,

55:39.419 --> 55:45.259
the people you loved
and lost forever.

55:45.300 --> 55:47.928
Come now, Poe.

55:47.970 --> 55:49.596
You love me!

55:49.638 --> 55:52.349
You've been a corpse
walking amongst the living

55:52.391 --> 55:55.310
for a long time, Edgar.

55:55.352 --> 55:58.272
It must have been
quite a strain.

55:58.313 --> 55:59.940
Maybe you're right.

55:59.982 --> 56:03.151
Sometimes I think the only thing
that kept me from you

56:03.193 --> 56:05.445
was my beating heart.

56:05.487 --> 56:07.781
Look at your final act.

56:07.823 --> 56:10.033
They all succumb to my prowess.

56:10.075 --> 56:11.702
The poor, the weak;

56:11.743 --> 56:14.872
the rich, the powerful.

56:14.913 --> 56:17.875
Everybody bows before me.

56:17.916 --> 56:21.003
I offer you one last chance.

01:04:52.222 --> 01:04:56.893
Who dares insult us with
this blasphemous mockery?

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:55.822
I don't want my work
to be lost forever.

01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:01.160
My work is eternal.

01:08:01.202 --> 01:08:03.621
I want that eternity.

01:08:03.663 --> 01:08:06.541
I want to be sure
my words will survive me,

01:08:06.583 --> 01:08:09.711
that they will be
never lost in time.

01:08:09.752 --> 01:08:10.878
That, my friend,

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:14.257
nevermore.
