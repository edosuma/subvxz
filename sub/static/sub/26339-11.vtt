WEBVTT

00:02.524 --> 00:03.612
...plum, lemon, apple,
cherries -- No, no, no, no.

00:03.655 --> 00:05.657
Cantaloupe. Yep. And those
are the ten best fruits.

00:05.701 --> 00:07.094
Good one.Next, vegetables.
Mm.

00:07.137 --> 00:09.444
-So, celery, ca-- Wha--
-Okay, I can't take it anymore.

00:09.487 --> 00:12.273
-Wow.
-Will, what's up with the suit?

00:12.316 --> 00:14.144
-Yeah.
-It's for my audition to,

00:14.188 --> 00:16.407
get this,
be an on-air meteorologist.

00:16.451 --> 00:18.627
-Ohh!
-Whoa, Will!

00:18.670 --> 00:20.063
I ran into
an old producing buddy of mine

00:20.107 --> 00:21.108
at a kitchen supply store.

00:21.151 --> 00:23.066
I was right in the middle
of a free sample of crumb cake.

00:23.110 --> 00:24.024
And there she was.

00:25.764 --> 00:26.635
Mmm.

00:26.678 --> 00:27.766
Will?

00:29.333 --> 00:32.075
Tracy Freeze! Hi!

00:32.119 --> 00:33.729
Oh, it's been forever!
Yeah.

00:33.772 --> 00:36.253
So, are you still working from
home? Just full-on dad mode?

00:36.297 --> 00:38.864
Ah, nah. I'm actually
just killing time in here

00:38.908 --> 00:41.215
while they fix my bike
across the street.

00:41.258 --> 00:43.304
My motorcycle bike.
-Will Cooper?

00:43.347 --> 00:47.090
Your daddy/daughter
monogrammed chef hats are ready.Those aren't mine.

00:47.134 --> 00:48.874
Oh, your name's not Will?
And your daughter's
name's not Sophie?

00:48.918 --> 00:50.311
What are you --
a private detective?

00:52.356 --> 00:53.749
Ugh.

00:53.792 --> 00:56.186
So, she said I could audition
to be the weatherman for KZOP.

00:56.230 --> 00:57.361
K-ZOP!

00:57.405 --> 00:59.189
I've always kind of been
a behind-the-camera guy,

00:59.233 --> 01:00.147
but ever since Angie and I

01:00.190 --> 01:02.453
survived that tropical storm,
eh, I don't know.

01:02.497 --> 01:04.194
I've just been more willing
to put myself out there.

01:04.238 --> 01:05.456
This would be my dream job.

01:05.500 --> 01:06.675
Well, get that mon-ey.

01:06.718 --> 01:08.111
Wow!
I'm really proud of you.

01:08.155 --> 01:10.113
Hey, um, can I get free tickets
to be in the audience?

01:10.157 --> 01:12.115
There is no audience
for local news.

01:12.159 --> 01:13.334
Ar-Are there free pens?

01:13.377 --> 01:15.249
There may be pens, yeah.Nice!

01:15.292 --> 01:16.467
Listen, if they give you
a secretary,

01:16.511 --> 01:18.687
you want to make sure that you
pick a homely one, right?

01:18.730 --> 01:20.906
Mm-hmm.
Big nose. Weird skin.

01:20.950 --> 01:22.169
Or else you're not gonna
get anything done.

01:22.212 --> 01:25.998
Anyway, I've spent all day
making an audition tape,

01:26.042 --> 01:27.348
and I would love
some feedback

01:27.391 --> 01:28.914
'cause I have no idea
if it's any good.

01:28.958 --> 01:31.178
You know, I've just been
a stay-at-home dad too long.

01:31.221 --> 01:33.223
My dad skills are on point.

01:33.267 --> 01:35.356
I can make a lunch
with my eyes closed.

01:35.399 --> 01:37.488
And, yes, my dishwasher thinks
I'm charming, but will L.A.?

01:37.532 --> 01:40.491
You know, will I have that
Al Roker-level of charisma?

01:40.535 --> 01:43.190
That elusive zazz.What is "zazz"?

01:43.233 --> 01:44.974
When you experience zazz,
you'll know it.

01:45.017 --> 01:47.194
In your bones.
And a little in your butt.

01:47.237 --> 01:49.283
Al Roker gives me
a tingle in my tush.

01:49.326 --> 01:51.720
Ar-Are you guys saying "zazz"
or -- or "jazz"?

01:51.763 --> 01:53.548
Hey, dude,
I'll take a look at that tape.

01:53.591 --> 01:55.419
I got a pretty good eye
for zazz.
Great.

01:55.463 --> 01:57.421
Count me in, too.And Poppy's in!

01:57.465 --> 01:58.422
Mm-hmm.Yeah,
I want to see this.

01:58.466 --> 01:59.945
Thank you.
The big three!

01:59.989 --> 02:02.513
Uh, Mom?
Something happened.

02:02.557 --> 02:04.341
Is it noticeable?

02:05.255 --> 02:08.171
Yeah, buddy. Yeah.

02:08.215 --> 02:11.174
--Captions by VITAC--

02:15.787 --> 02:19.182
Not to backseat-drive here,
but it's permanent marker.

02:19.226 --> 02:21.532
This feels more like
a cover-up than a wipe-off.

02:21.576 --> 02:23.578
Graham,
who did this to you?!

02:23.621 --> 02:25.406
Who cares, really?

02:25.449 --> 02:29.279
One day you have a forehead, and
the next day, you have "farts."

02:29.323 --> 02:30.759
No big deal.

02:30.802 --> 02:32.848
Disagree.
Picture Day is in two days,

02:32.891 --> 02:35.633
and a bad picture
can haunt you the entire year.

02:35.677 --> 02:38.419
Trust me.
I've had some rough ones.

02:38.462 --> 02:41.770
One...two...three!Every Picture Day, I get
so nervous, my smile becomes,

02:41.813 --> 02:44.251
well, real weird.

02:44.294 --> 02:45.339
I'm a lost cause,

02:45.382 --> 02:47.471
but you still have time
to take a good picture.

02:47.515 --> 02:49.256
Graham, sweetie,

02:49.299 --> 02:50.605
tell Mommy who did this,
okay?

02:50.648 --> 02:52.607
I promise I'll be cool.

02:56.654 --> 02:58.830
It was the twins.

02:58.874 --> 03:00.223
I'll kill them!

03:01.877 --> 03:03.661
Oh, hey,
I can't babysit tonight.

03:03.705 --> 03:05.924
I mean, technically, I could,
but I don't want to.

03:05.968 --> 03:08.492
We're here
because your daughters

03:08.536 --> 03:11.103
vandalized my son's face.

03:11.147 --> 03:13.497
His Picture Day is ruined!

03:13.541 --> 03:16.674
And not to be an alarmist,
but maybe his life.

03:16.718 --> 03:19.590
Maybe they'll take profile shots
this year. We're good.

03:19.634 --> 03:21.331
Let's go.
-No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

03:21.375 --> 03:23.681
You need to deal with this
with Emma and Amy.

03:23.725 --> 03:24.943
I don't even know
where they are.

03:24.987 --> 03:26.293
They're standing
right there,

03:26.336 --> 03:27.903
polishing your golf clubs.

03:27.946 --> 03:31.472
Girls, why did you write "farts"
on Graham's face?

03:31.515 --> 03:32.603
'Cause it's funny.

03:32.647 --> 03:34.039
Sooo funny.

03:35.650 --> 03:36.607
It says "farts"!

03:36.651 --> 03:38.696
Oh, man, I can't breathe.

03:38.740 --> 03:41.264
You gotta admit:
it's hilarious.

03:41.308 --> 03:42.918
It says "farts" on his face.

03:42.961 --> 03:44.833
I mean, I can see
the humor in it.

03:44.876 --> 03:46.269
There you go.No.

03:46.313 --> 03:47.314
It's not funny.

03:47.357 --> 03:50.665
My son's face looks like
the side of a bathroom stall.

03:50.708 --> 03:51.970
We need an apology.

03:52.014 --> 03:53.320
An apology? No, no.

03:53.363 --> 03:55.365
Apologies are for the weak.

03:55.409 --> 03:57.454
Does the lion
apologize to the gazelle?

03:57.498 --> 04:00.501
Does the tornado apologize
to the trailer park?

04:00.544 --> 04:01.676
These are your kids!

04:01.719 --> 04:03.982
You need to teach them
right and wrong!

04:04.026 --> 04:07.551
I am. By letting them
act the way they see fit.

04:07.595 --> 04:09.074
Who knows how long
I'm gonna be around?

04:09.118 --> 04:10.554
But while I'm here,

04:10.598 --> 04:13.340
I am teaching them
to be self-sufficient.

04:13.383 --> 04:16.125
So in the future, when a
self-driving car is president

04:16.168 --> 04:17.648
and the robots
have figured out

04:17.692 --> 04:20.172
that the only thing
they need from us is teeth,

04:20.216 --> 04:22.523
my girls
will still be standing.

04:22.566 --> 04:23.437
Unlike others.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.090
What the hell
are you doing?

04:25.134 --> 04:28.877
God, I love gardenia season!

04:28.920 --> 04:32.184
Look, I have worked too hard
all by myself

04:32.228 --> 04:33.447
to drill a moral code
into Graham,

04:33.490 --> 04:35.536
and I'm not gonna let
your girls undo it.

04:35.579 --> 04:39.017
If you refuse to civilize
them, I'll do it myself.

04:39.061 --> 04:40.454
Sleepover at my place.

04:40.497 --> 04:42.891
Sleepover!Let's go get our bags!

04:42.934 --> 04:44.545
This is gonna be
a night.

04:44.588 --> 04:46.547
Good luck
getting an apology.

04:46.590 --> 04:48.462
Maybe after that,
you can push back the ocean

04:48.505 --> 04:49.506
or wrestle the wind.

04:49.550 --> 04:53.249
Just to be clear, I'm telling
you it's impossible.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.598
We'll see about that.

04:54.642 --> 04:55.773
Good evening.

04:55.817 --> 04:57.558
Thanks for bothering
to tune in.

04:57.601 --> 04:59.255
Bet you think
I got nothing to tell you.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.388
You think
it'll always be sunny and warm.

05:01.431 --> 05:04.129
'Cause you've been lulled
into a California complacency

05:04.173 --> 05:07.481
like a little,
tan baby eating avocado.

05:07.524 --> 05:08.830
Nom, nom, nom.

05:08.873 --> 05:10.048
Well, guess what.

05:10.092 --> 05:11.615
There's actually
a low-pressure system

05:11.659 --> 05:12.834
coming in from the south.

05:12.877 --> 05:14.488
Do you know what that means,
even?

05:14.531 --> 05:17.491
Here's a hint: It's gonna rain.

05:17.534 --> 05:20.363
That's all for now.
Remember, I'm Will Cooper,

05:20.407 --> 05:22.844
weather you like it or not.

05:24.541 --> 05:27.588
Well? What do you think?The camera loves you.

05:27.631 --> 05:28.850
I don't even know
if I could watch that again.

05:28.893 --> 05:29.938
Very provocative.

05:29.981 --> 05:31.853
Really?
Please be honest.

05:33.768 --> 05:35.509
You weather-shamed us!Yeah, never show that again
to anybody.

05:35.552 --> 05:36.597
Hey,
here's a weather report:

05:36.640 --> 05:39.382
That audition
was a natural disaster.

05:41.210 --> 05:44.300
Okay, we only have 48 hours
until Picture Day.

05:44.344 --> 05:48.260
Luckily, a woman on the Internet
swears by coconut oil.

05:48.304 --> 05:49.827
At least it's moisturizing.

05:49.871 --> 05:51.481
Wait.
Water's our snack?

05:51.525 --> 05:52.656
It is for now.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.441
Give up the popcorn,
D'Amato.

05:54.484 --> 05:56.399
Nope.
Not until you apologize.

05:56.443 --> 05:58.619
I'm sorry
for all the hassle.

05:58.662 --> 06:00.838
No, no.
Y-Youdon't say you're sorry.

06:00.882 --> 06:02.318
Theydo.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.407
Apologize now!

06:04.451 --> 06:05.452
Is that the worst
you got?

06:05.495 --> 06:08.933
Oh, Angie D
is just warming up.

06:10.021 --> 06:13.503
Emma, Emma, Emma.

06:13.547 --> 06:15.592
We're friends, right?

06:16.506 --> 06:18.769
You like cheesy pop, Amy?

06:18.813 --> 06:22.556
This whole bowl could be yours
if you would only apologize.

06:22.599 --> 06:23.774
I know what you're doing.

06:23.818 --> 06:25.907
I've seen
two "Law and Orders."

06:25.950 --> 06:28.562
You foolish, foolish woman.

06:28.605 --> 06:30.564
Emma got some
when sheapologized.

06:30.607 --> 06:32.261
That never happened.

06:32.304 --> 06:33.654
I would sense it.

06:33.697 --> 06:34.437
Wait. Really?

06:34.481 --> 06:37.048
No, I heard you
talking to her.

06:37.092 --> 06:39.137
You people and twins.

06:40.617 --> 06:42.663
I don't know
the extent of your powers.

06:42.706 --> 06:44.404
This isn't over!

06:45.753 --> 06:48.016
Maybe you can add an "O",
you know,

06:48.059 --> 06:49.800
to make it "Of Arts"?

06:49.844 --> 06:53.543
Or, as the French
would call it, "des-artistes."

06:53.587 --> 06:55.893
That sounds classy.

06:55.937 --> 06:57.591
I was trying to be edgy.

06:57.634 --> 06:59.810
KZOP probably thinks
I'm some stay-at-home dad

06:59.854 --> 07:01.682
who smells like dryer sheets
and snickerdoodles.

07:01.725 --> 07:03.510
I had to subvert
their expectations.

07:03.553 --> 07:05.381
I don't think we expected
what we just saw.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.818
Look, Will, I love that
you're going after your dream.

07:07.862 --> 07:09.298
And I know how hard it is
to go back to work

07:09.341 --> 07:10.691
after you've been out of
the game for a while.

07:10.734 --> 07:11.822
That's how I felt
with the Winebrary.

07:11.866 --> 07:14.564
But -- and I don't know
how to put this nicely --

07:14.608 --> 07:16.740
that audition is one of
the worst things I've ever seen,

07:16.784 --> 07:18.394
and I've seen
Miggy's music video.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.874
"Mystery Señorita"?

07:19.917 --> 07:24.487
♪ Mystery señorita

I'll take that comparison
as a compliment.

08:08.575 --> 08:09.663
You shouldn't.

08:09.706 --> 08:11.578
Well, do you at least
have specific notes?

08:11.621 --> 08:12.666
Listen, your on-air persona

08:12.709 --> 08:15.233
is a little...Anderson Cooper-y?

08:15.277 --> 08:17.758
More like
"scary guy at a bus stop."Hmm. Noted.

08:17.801 --> 08:19.673
How about we help you
make a new tape?

08:19.716 --> 08:20.587
I could fix your look.

08:20.630 --> 08:21.979
I've been wanting
to do things

08:22.023 --> 08:23.720
to that hair
for a long time.

08:23.764 --> 08:24.895
Is something wrong
with my hair?

08:24.939 --> 08:26.331
How do you want me
to answer that?

08:26.375 --> 08:28.812
And I can give you
someone to play off of.

08:28.856 --> 08:30.335
I can be the newscaster
that throws to you.

08:30.379 --> 08:32.120
And I'll be your acting coach.
I'll make you

08:32.163 --> 08:34.122
a little less preachy
and a little more peachy.

08:34.165 --> 08:36.124
From hateable
to relatable!

08:36.167 --> 08:38.126
You guys, I can't tell you
how much I appreciate this.

08:38.169 --> 08:39.910
Tomorrow, Will Cooper,
we make you a star.

08:39.954 --> 08:42.609
This is gonna be the greatest
thing I've ever been a part of!

08:42.652 --> 08:44.349
-Whoo! Yay!
-Yeah!

08:44.393 --> 08:47.657
Both:
♪ Mystery señorita

08:47.701 --> 08:50.704
♪ Señorita, chiquitita,
mamacita ♪Oh, my God.

08:50.747 --> 08:52.270
No.
♪ ¿Quién eres? ♪

08:56.884 --> 08:58.450
Well, it can't
stay there forever, right?

08:58.494 --> 09:01.715
-Here. We wrote "sorry" notes.
-I hope you're happy, Angie.

09:01.758 --> 09:03.934
You made us abandon
our principles.

09:03.978 --> 09:05.762
Can I ask what was it
that finally turned you?

09:05.806 --> 09:06.763
Was it when I cried?

09:06.807 --> 09:08.809
No, we just got bored.

09:08.852 --> 09:10.680
Can we just have
cheesy pop now?

09:10.724 --> 09:12.813
One more thing.
Hold 'em up.

09:14.249 --> 09:15.946
Yes!

09:15.990 --> 09:17.687
Thank you.

09:22.518 --> 09:23.824
Hello, Douglas.

09:23.867 --> 09:25.608
I don't believe it.
How much did you pay 'em?

09:25.652 --> 09:26.609
It happened.

09:26.653 --> 09:27.871
They apologized.

09:27.915 --> 09:30.395
It took four hours
using questionable tactics,

09:30.439 --> 09:32.180
but I domesticated
your girls.

09:32.223 --> 09:33.964
Sweet freakin' dreams!

09:35.575 --> 09:39.622
Good morning. Hope everyone
had a good night's sleep.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.972
I slept like a rock.

09:42.016 --> 09:44.192
Mom! Your face!

09:44.235 --> 09:45.454
-Oh, boy.
-What?

09:47.674 --> 09:48.805
Oh!

09:52.896 --> 09:55.290
Oh, you're going down.

10:00.687 --> 10:03.690
It's not perfect,
but it's a start. We'll find it.

10:03.733 --> 10:05.648
Will: All right, thanks, guys.
Best crew in the biz.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.084
Let's have a great show.

10:07.955 --> 10:09.870
Thank you so much
for being up here with me.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.698
It already feels more like
a real local news broadcast.

10:11.741 --> 10:13.221
Rory: Action!

10:13.264 --> 10:15.658
Authorities are calling it
the bloodiest derailment

10:15.702 --> 10:16.877
in trolly-car history.

10:16.920 --> 10:19.270
And now here's Will Cooper
with the weather!

10:20.707 --> 10:22.926
How...How bloody was it?

10:22.970 --> 10:26.234
I'm Will Cooper,
"weather" you like it or not.

10:26.277 --> 10:27.583
I need 40% less hands.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.542
I'm Will Cooper,
"weather" you like it or not.

10:30.586 --> 10:32.109
Do your eyes always do that?What are you doing?

10:32.153 --> 10:33.807
Right.
It wants to go right.

10:33.850 --> 10:36.505
It's telling me
it wants to go right.
I'm just listening.

10:36.548 --> 10:39.551
I'm Will Cooper,
"weather"you like it or not.

10:39.595 --> 10:42.685
It started in the toilet, and
now it's headed for your mouth.

10:42.729 --> 10:43.904
And now the weather.
Will?

10:45.383 --> 10:46.384
Rory: Okay, try this.

10:46.428 --> 10:47.864
The camera
is a waitress at a diner.

10:47.908 --> 10:49.126
She doesn't know
she's beautiful.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.345
She asks you for a refill,

10:50.388 --> 10:52.521
and now this is your chance
to introduce yourself.

10:52.564 --> 10:54.175
Who...are...you?!

10:54.218 --> 10:55.089
Will Cooper?

10:55.132 --> 10:56.264
Who do you want to be?!

10:56.307 --> 10:57.482
Will Cooper, the weatherman?

10:57.526 --> 10:59.180
Killing me, Cooper!
You're killing me!

10:59.223 --> 11:01.138
Left, left.Poppy:
The boy and his llama

11:01.182 --> 11:03.924
were both released
from the hospital...

11:03.967 --> 11:05.708
to be buried side by side.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.057
Over to you, Will.

11:07.101 --> 11:09.190
Where are these stories
coming from?!

11:09.233 --> 11:10.844
Gah! You almost had it!

11:10.887 --> 11:13.281
I'm Will Cooper, "weather" --

11:13.324 --> 11:15.631
Need more dew.

11:15.675 --> 11:19.504
I'm Will Cooper...
"weather" you like it or not.

11:19.548 --> 11:21.419
Okay, 100% less sign-off.

11:21.463 --> 11:22.594
No sign-off?

11:22.638 --> 11:23.857
How are they gonna know
when it's over?

11:23.900 --> 11:25.510
Are you giving me bangs?

11:25.554 --> 11:27.077
This is what your hair
wants to do.

11:27.121 --> 11:29.427
This is the one! I can feel it!
-Action.

11:29.471 --> 11:31.734
Good evening. Winds
are coming in from the east.

11:31.778 --> 11:34.519
We should see a cool-down for
most of Southern Los Angeles.

11:34.563 --> 11:36.347
Chances of rain are high.

11:39.263 --> 11:40.221
Is it over?

11:40.264 --> 11:41.570
You don't know...

11:41.613 --> 11:42.789
'cause there was no sign-off.

11:42.832 --> 11:44.138
The bangs were a mistake.

11:44.181 --> 11:45.226
Of course they were.

11:45.269 --> 11:47.315
That's not the problem,
Miggy.

11:47.358 --> 11:49.012
I just don't have the zazz.

11:49.056 --> 11:50.797
Maybe I did at one point
in my life,

11:50.840 --> 11:52.973
but I sure as hell
don't have it now.

11:53.016 --> 11:55.149
I've been a stay-at-home dad
for five years.

11:55.192 --> 11:57.804
And -- And maybe
that's all I am.

11:59.066 --> 12:00.676
See? That's the oven.

12:00.720 --> 12:01.764
I made you a quiche.

12:01.808 --> 12:02.809
One for each of you.

12:02.852 --> 12:04.114
I didn't even see him
make that!

12:04.158 --> 12:06.682
Of course you didn't.
I'm a lunch wizard.

12:06.726 --> 12:07.814
Angie: Douglas!

12:07.857 --> 12:09.554
Douglas!

12:09.598 --> 12:11.818
Hey, you got a mustache
on your face.

12:11.861 --> 12:13.907
Your girls are out of control.

12:13.950 --> 12:15.865
They tore up
their "sorry" notes!

12:15.909 --> 12:18.346
You have to do something
about this.I get it.

12:18.389 --> 12:21.044
You're upset you look
like a carnival barker
in the Dust Bowl.

12:21.088 --> 12:24.352
But I already told you, we
don't do apologies around here.

12:24.395 --> 12:26.920
My girls are
strong and unshakable.

12:26.963 --> 12:28.660
Just like you
and your brother, Luigi.

12:28.704 --> 12:30.706
Are you done
with the mustache jokes?

12:30.750 --> 12:32.795
Yes, but how much
for a gondola ride?

12:34.318 --> 12:36.146
So they're
not gonna apologize?

12:36.190 --> 12:38.975
Your girls are hopeless,
and I'm done trying to help.

12:39.019 --> 12:41.586
Now let's go try on every shade
of foundation at Sephora.

12:41.630 --> 12:43.414
We're not going anywhere!

12:43.458 --> 12:46.461
Emma and Amy,
get over here!

12:46.504 --> 12:48.463
Mess with me?
Fine.

12:48.506 --> 12:51.945
But no one
messes with my mom!

12:51.988 --> 12:54.077
Apologize!

12:54.121 --> 12:55.862
Or else.

12:55.905 --> 12:56.950
Or else what?

12:56.993 --> 12:58.821
You wanna fight us, Fart Head?

12:58.865 --> 13:00.736
-No, no, no, no, no.

13:00.780 --> 13:01.955
Nobody wants to fight.

13:01.998 --> 13:04.435
You wanna rumble,
let's rumble!

13:04.479 --> 13:05.436
To the street!

13:06.655 --> 13:07.395
Are you happy?

13:07.438 --> 13:09.092
There's a rumble happening!

13:09.136 --> 13:11.051
A rumble needs
like 20 people.

13:11.094 --> 13:12.008
But fine.

13:16.230 --> 13:17.666
I can't believe
our kids are fighting.

13:17.709 --> 13:18.885
Well, technically, they've
only been circling each other

13:18.928 --> 13:21.322
for half an hour.Yeah,
but look at Graham.

13:21.365 --> 13:23.498
Something primal
has been released.

13:23.541 --> 13:25.195
I've never seen him
circle anything.

13:25.239 --> 13:27.850
I'm 45 pounds
of pent-up emotion!

13:27.894 --> 13:29.634
I can circle all day, baby!

13:29.678 --> 13:30.940
You know what?
You did this.

13:30.984 --> 13:32.986
How you raise your kids
affects my kid.

13:33.029 --> 13:34.639
You're not on an island,
Douglas.

13:34.683 --> 13:37.512
I can't help it if I've taught
my kids survival skills.

13:37.555 --> 13:40.950
Being a jerk is not
a survival skill, all right?

13:40.994 --> 13:43.083
No one survives
separated from the pack.

13:43.126 --> 13:45.433
In order to stay in the pack,
you gotta be nice

13:45.476 --> 13:46.738
and apologize
to your friends.

13:46.782 --> 13:48.088
Yeah,
I don't believe in packs.

13:48.131 --> 13:48.871
We're born alone.

13:48.915 --> 13:51.091
We make love alone.
We die alone.

13:51.134 --> 13:52.788
It's a dog-eat-dog world.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.137
Fogerty clan all day!

13:54.181 --> 13:55.704
Protect ya neck!

13:55.747 --> 13:56.923
You getting tired?!

13:56.966 --> 13:59.229
Really? Because you depend
on us for a lot.

13:59.273 --> 14:01.057
Carpool. Sleepover.

14:01.101 --> 14:03.016
That one day you said
you just had "the grumpies."

14:03.059 --> 14:06.671
I did.
Hell, you're probably
depending on me right now

14:06.715 --> 14:08.238
to jump in
and stop this whole thing.

14:08.282 --> 14:10.937
That's what you sensitive
parents tend to do.

14:10.980 --> 14:12.025
Wow. Okay.

14:12.068 --> 14:13.156
You know what?
You want dog-eat-dog?

14:13.200 --> 14:15.158
You got it.

14:15.202 --> 14:17.247
I'm not protecting your kids
anymore. Hit 'em, Graham!

14:17.291 --> 14:18.901
W-W-Wait.
What are you doing?

14:18.945 --> 14:20.120
Playing by your rules.

14:20.163 --> 14:22.122
This is what you want, right?
Jungle law?

14:22.165 --> 14:24.385
Take 'em down, Graham!
Avenge Mommy!

14:24.428 --> 14:26.604
Heads up,
we come from a long line

14:26.648 --> 14:28.824
of Sicilian
street fighters.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.913
I got D'Amato blood
in my veins!

14:30.957 --> 14:32.567
Hit 'em, Graham!

14:32.610 --> 14:36.788
This is for my hero:
my mother!

14:36.832 --> 14:39.617
Okay, wait, wait! Stop!
All right, no one fight, okay?

14:39.661 --> 14:42.533
Girls, listen.
Graham is your friend.

14:42.577 --> 14:45.275
And even though he's...
whiny and weird

14:45.319 --> 14:47.930
and picks his nose
in the back seat of my car

14:47.974 --> 14:49.410
when he thinks I'm not looking,

14:49.453 --> 14:52.892
the point is,
he needs you, and...

14:54.676 --> 14:55.807
...you need him.

14:55.851 --> 14:57.200
You're joking, right, Dad?

14:57.244 --> 14:58.941
This guy?

14:58.985 --> 15:00.073
Apologize.

15:00.116 --> 15:02.075
It's the right thing
to do.

15:02.118 --> 15:04.904
Fine. Sorry for writing "farts"
on your head.

15:05.992 --> 15:07.994
And for your 'stache.

15:09.212 --> 15:10.779
I accept.

15:10.822 --> 15:12.433
Thank God it's over.

15:12.476 --> 15:15.088
Being angry is exhausting.

15:15.131 --> 15:16.306
Thank you, Douglas.

15:16.350 --> 15:19.092
And I'm sorry for holding
your girls hostage all night.

15:19.135 --> 15:22.182
I gotta be honest,
I don't think I fed them.

15:22.225 --> 15:24.227
Apology accepted.

15:24.271 --> 15:26.403
Good...good.

15:26.447 --> 15:28.101
Do you have anything
you want to say to me?

15:28.144 --> 15:30.538
Yeah, no.
I can't do it.

15:30.581 --> 15:31.321
Really, dude?

15:31.365 --> 15:33.541
I'm Dr. Douglas Fogerty.

15:33.584 --> 15:35.978
I haven't said sorry
since 1998.

15:36.022 --> 15:38.894
I was alone and wanted
to see how it would feel.

15:38.938 --> 15:39.982
I didn't care for it.

15:40.026 --> 15:42.332
But I'll apologize
in my own way.

15:42.376 --> 15:43.768
Trust me.

15:43.812 --> 15:46.597
Oh, God. This is my fault.
I gotta work on my banter.

15:46.641 --> 15:48.121
I blame Miggy.
What?!

15:48.164 --> 15:49.557
You know every good performance
starts with the hair.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.994
Hey, you're the one that
told him to "Liza it up."

15:52.038 --> 15:53.126
No one knows who that is!

15:53.169 --> 15:55.693
-Ooh, take that back!
-I will not.

15:55.737 --> 15:58.479
My friends, it is none
of your fault, okay?

15:58.522 --> 16:01.699
I just...don't have
the charisma to be on TV.

16:01.743 --> 16:04.006
I mean, who did I think I was?
Mario Lopez?

16:04.050 --> 16:05.007
He was on my flight
to Hawaii.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.574
Coach.

16:06.617 --> 16:09.229
Will, some people don't know
what their dream job is. You do.

16:09.272 --> 16:10.621
That's a start,
and you have to start somewhere.

16:10.665 --> 16:11.796
Miggy: Yeah, man.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.407
You should've seen
my first sneaker video.

16:13.450 --> 16:16.018
It was just a 10-second
close-up of a shoelace.

16:16.062 --> 16:18.281
But that close-up
got me to where I am today.

16:18.325 --> 16:20.066
I mean, look at me now.

16:20.109 --> 16:23.243
Fail early. Fail often.
Fail forward.

16:23.286 --> 16:25.506
I got that quote from
Will Smith's Instagram story.No.

16:25.549 --> 16:28.422
This is all very inspiring,
and you know how much
I love Will Smith.

16:28.465 --> 16:30.032
He's a "Bad Boy."

16:30.076 --> 16:31.164
But I just don't think
it's --

16:31.207 --> 16:32.687
Okay, guys,
great advice all around.

16:32.730 --> 16:34.602
But I've lived with this man
for seven years.

16:34.645 --> 16:36.647
I think
I know how to handle this.

16:36.691 --> 16:39.085
Dad? Family meeting?

16:39.128 --> 16:41.739
Sophie, honey,
please do not worry about me.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.263
I am going to be fine.

16:43.306 --> 16:44.829
Plus, I learned
a valuable lesson.

16:44.873 --> 16:46.962
Which is?Stick to what I know.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.703
Is it for my sake?

16:48.746 --> 16:50.183
Have I been
holding you back?

16:50.226 --> 16:53.403
What? Sophie.
No way.

16:53.447 --> 16:56.319
I would not trade all these
years at home with you

16:56.363 --> 16:57.538
for anything in the world.

16:57.581 --> 17:00.149
I'm giving up because
I don't have what it takes

17:00.193 --> 17:01.455
to be a prime-time
weather anchor.

17:01.498 --> 17:04.240
I just...
don't have the zazz.

17:06.373 --> 17:10.203
I'm thinking of heading to
the park later this afternoon.

17:10.246 --> 17:12.205
What boots
do you think I should wear?

17:12.248 --> 17:14.294
That was
a very abrupt subject change.

17:14.337 --> 17:16.209
What just happened?Indulge me.

17:16.252 --> 17:18.167
Okay, well,
if you're really going,

17:18.211 --> 17:19.299
uh, it rained yesterday,

17:19.342 --> 17:20.300
so there's definitely
gonna be mud.

17:20.343 --> 17:22.432
So I'm thinking boots
with a tread.

17:22.476 --> 17:23.651
I'd say something rubber,

17:23.694 --> 17:25.870
just in case that
precipitation comes back.

17:25.914 --> 17:28.134
And now
I'm thinking windbreaker.

17:28.177 --> 17:29.787
Something with a hood,
like --
Dad.

17:29.831 --> 17:31.224
Are you hearing yourself?

17:31.267 --> 17:33.356
Yeah, I was just about
to ramp up on Gore-Tex

17:33.400 --> 17:34.705
and go deep on dew.

17:34.749 --> 17:36.359
Right.
Because your dad skills

17:36.403 --> 17:38.231
include delivering
a weather forecast every day.

17:38.274 --> 17:39.884
To me.

17:39.928 --> 17:42.452
Well, yeah, but I just want you
to know what you're in for.

17:42.496 --> 17:45.803
And I do. Because every morning
when I'm picking out my boots,

17:45.847 --> 17:49.111
you do a full 15 minutes
on wind speeds,

17:49.155 --> 17:52.810
humidity, what time
I should expect the sunset.

17:52.854 --> 17:55.596
And all that could be boring.
But with you, it's not.

17:55.639 --> 17:58.903
You make it fun
and interesting and weird.

17:58.947 --> 18:01.819
Why don't you just do that
in your audition?

18:01.863 --> 18:03.125
Can't you just be you?

18:06.389 --> 18:09.262
Fun fact: Hasn't been this hot
since June 1990

18:09.305 --> 18:11.699
when temps soared to 112.

18:11.742 --> 18:14.049
Hot. Tss!
Do not touch.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.269
Uh, that's all for now.
You stay cool, L.A.

18:16.312 --> 18:17.487
I'm Will Coop
with your weather scoop.

18:17.531 --> 18:18.619
Back to you.

18:18.662 --> 18:21.361
Will, you did it.
I'm so proud of you.

18:21.404 --> 18:22.362
You were great, Daddy.

18:22.405 --> 18:24.973
I felt that heat!

18:25.016 --> 18:25.974
Good job!

18:26.017 --> 18:27.628
High praise.
How was the hair?

18:27.671 --> 18:28.933
We're close.
It's getting there.

18:28.977 --> 18:31.545
That was really nice work,
Cooper.

18:31.588 --> 18:33.024
Ah, thank you, Tracy.

18:33.068 --> 18:34.939
Thank you so much for letting me
come and do this in person.

18:34.983 --> 18:36.854
Well, you barged in, so
I didn't really have a choice.

18:36.898 --> 18:38.813
Mm-hmm.But I liked what I saw.

18:38.856 --> 18:40.728
Well, I couldn't have done it
without my team.

18:40.771 --> 18:43.557
Mm.
We got Rory guiding
the performance, Miggy on hair,

18:43.600 --> 18:44.949
Poppy leading me in...Hey.

18:44.993 --> 18:46.168
...and Sophie...

18:46.212 --> 18:48.214
I pretty much couldn't do
anything without Sophie.

18:48.257 --> 18:50.390
-Aww.
-Aww.

18:50.433 --> 18:51.652
Y-You know
none of these people

18:51.695 --> 18:52.957
can come to work
with you every day?

18:53.001 --> 18:54.524
Not a problem.
Two of them have school.

18:54.568 --> 18:55.656
She runs a business.

18:55.699 --> 18:57.658
Miggy would probably come --Yes! Free pass.

18:57.701 --> 18:59.660
Wait. I got the job?!

18:59.703 --> 19:02.663
Yes, you are KZOP's
newest substitute weatherman.

19:02.706 --> 19:05.405
Sunday mornings, as needed,
5:00 to 7:00 a.m.

19:05.448 --> 19:06.667
Your audience
will mostly be pets

19:06.710 --> 19:08.625
who step
on remote controls.

19:08.669 --> 19:11.889
Uh...um...

19:11.933 --> 19:13.978
that...sounds...

19:14.022 --> 19:14.979
awesome!

19:15.023 --> 19:17.330
I accept!

19:17.373 --> 19:18.548
Oh, man!

19:18.592 --> 19:20.594
Willy Cooper
coming to a city near you!

19:20.637 --> 19:22.900
Well, it's only L.A.,
and you'll barely be on TV.

19:22.944 --> 19:24.250
Okay, staying put
for a select group!

19:24.293 --> 19:25.251
I'm honored!

19:25.294 --> 19:27.253
Willy Coop!Oh!

19:27.296 --> 19:28.384
Together:
Willy Coop!

19:28.428 --> 19:30.256
Come on!Willy Coop!

19:30.299 --> 19:32.258
Willy Coop!But seriously, none of you
can ever come to work.

19:32.301 --> 19:33.911
Willy C.!Okay? Like, ever.

19:33.955 --> 19:34.956
Willy C.!

19:38.394 --> 19:39.352
Okay, smile.

19:40.701 --> 19:44.357
This is the original, uncut
"Mystery Señorita."
Huh.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.489
Oh, it's 43 minutes long?
I'm not watching that.

19:46.533 --> 19:47.925
Hey.

19:47.969 --> 19:50.232
Hey.
Congrats on your new job.

19:50.276 --> 19:51.799
Thanks.
Congrats on the new 'stache.

19:51.842 --> 19:53.453
I'm glad you finally made it
through puberty.

19:53.496 --> 19:55.498
Funny. You know, I heard
there's an audition tape of you

19:55.542 --> 19:58.022
floating around where you're
real bitchy about rain.

19:58.066 --> 20:00.024
Good luck finding
the Pink Panther.

20:00.068 --> 20:02.331
We got this for you.We're sorry, Graham.

20:02.375 --> 20:05.116
Is this
actually happening?

20:05.160 --> 20:06.335
Am I cool?!

20:09.164 --> 20:11.819
I think you were right
about that whole pack thing,

20:11.862 --> 20:15.823
though I've actually always
looked at myself as a lone wolf.

20:15.866 --> 20:17.303
Well, for better or worse,
you've got us.

20:17.346 --> 20:18.913
And, God forbid,
something ever happens,

20:18.956 --> 20:20.697
we'll take care
of your girls.

20:20.741 --> 20:22.960
Just try to watch
the red-meat intake, okay?

20:23.004 --> 20:24.701
Yeah,
that's not gonna happen.

20:25.528 --> 20:27.617
What's this?
My apology.

20:27.661 --> 20:30.272
Do what you feel is right.

20:30.316 --> 20:31.752
I'm gonna write "butts."

20:31.795 --> 20:33.623
Honestly, I expected worse.

20:37.410 --> 20:39.499
Okay, give me
a nice, big smile.

20:39.542 --> 20:40.456
Don't get your hopes up,
lady.

20:40.500 --> 20:43.285
Many have tried.
All have failed.

20:43.329 --> 20:45.418
Oh, my God! "Butts"?!

20:45.461 --> 20:47.637
One, two, three.

20:48.725 --> 20:51.293
Wait.
Did I just smile for real?

20:52.555 --> 20:54.296
Yes!
Okay, wait just a minute.

20:54.340 --> 20:56.167
One more with the, uh,
the group and everything.

20:56.211 --> 20:58.169
Oh, my God, Will.
It's happening.

20:58.213 --> 20:59.301
Your hair
is perfect right now.

20:59.345 --> 21:00.433
This is how
it always looks.

21:00.476 --> 21:02.217
No, no, no, no.
Dude, trust me.No, it looks good.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.523
Hey, yo, yo, yo!
Take this pic right now

21:03.566 --> 21:04.567
before it changes.
Come on.

21:04.611 --> 21:06.395
So you want
a random group shot?

21:06.439 --> 21:08.310
You're taking
someone else's time, you know.

21:08.354 --> 21:09.572
Right. Time is money.

21:09.616 --> 21:11.922
Get yourself something.

21:13.141 --> 21:14.534
And this isn't random.

21:14.577 --> 21:15.709
This is my pack.

21:15.752 --> 21:17.537
But I'm only doing this once,

21:17.580 --> 21:19.190
so nobody blink.

21:19.234 --> 21:20.757
Everyone say "zazz"!

21:20.801 --> 21:22.672
Together: Zazz!

21:22.716 --> 21:24.283
Not sayin' it.
