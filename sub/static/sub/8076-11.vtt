00:03.737 --> 00:07.007
[music playing]

00:08.309 --> 00:11.379
Are you excited that
your daddy's coming home?

00:11.412 --> 00:13.447
You remember your
daddy, don't you?

00:13.481 --> 00:17.218
He's got a big head and
funny hair, just like you do.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.119
Mmm!

00:18.152 --> 00:19.019
Yum, yum, yum.

00:19.053 --> 00:21.089
There's so much to tell him.

00:21.122 --> 00:24.325
It's almost like some
insane woman made it all up.

00:24.358 --> 00:25.159
Mmm!

00:28.062 --> 00:31.332
And while Daddy was out in
California counting fat grams

00:31.365 --> 00:33.067
and pointing out nose jobs--

00:33.101 --> 00:37.205
mmm-- we were in New York City.

00:37.238 --> 00:40.040
New York is funny, huh?

00:40.074 --> 00:41.375
King Kong didn't fall.

00:41.409 --> 00:42.343
He actually jumped.

00:45.213 --> 00:46.147
Thank you.

00:46.180 --> 00:49.383
And Aunt Jackie's
dating a prince.

00:49.417 --> 00:54.555
You got lots bigger, and
so did Darlene's tummy.

00:54.588 --> 00:58.426
And-- and DJ's funny
voice went away,

00:58.459 --> 01:01.762
which is a relief to all the
doggies in the neighborhood.

01:01.795 --> 01:03.497
Mmm.

01:03.531 --> 01:05.233
Oh, and one more thing.

01:05.266 --> 01:06.667
Grandma came out of the closet.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.539
Can you say, uh-oh?

01:11.572 --> 01:14.375
Uh-oh.

01:14.408 --> 01:18.746
THEME LYRICS: And what doesn't
kill us is making us stronger.

01:18.779 --> 01:23.151
We're gonna last longer than
that greatest wall in China

01:23.184 --> 01:26.620
or that rabbit with the drum.

01:26.654 --> 01:32.025
If there's one thing that
I've learned while waiting

01:32.059 --> 01:35.963
for my turn, it's that in
each life some rain falls,

01:35.996 --> 01:38.932
but you also get some sun.

01:38.966 --> 01:43.371
And we'll make out
better than OK.

01:43.404 --> 01:47.241
Hear what I say every day.

01:59.187 --> 02:00.154
[gasp]

02:00.188 --> 02:02.656
Stop it.

02:02.690 --> 02:03.957
Oh!

02:03.991 --> 02:07.228
Stop it, you princely animal!

02:07.261 --> 02:08.562
[gasp]

02:08.596 --> 02:10.931
Uh, I got to go.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.099
No.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.901
No, I can't.

02:13.934 --> 02:16.404
No, I can't.

02:16.437 --> 02:19.173
Because I'm not alone.

02:19.207 --> 02:21.609
No, I-- OK, I will.

02:21.642 --> 02:22.943
OK.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.546
Oh, you bet I will.

02:25.579 --> 02:26.380
Buh-bye.

02:29.550 --> 02:34.255
If you're going to have
sex, use your own phone.

02:34.288 --> 02:37.191
Roseanne, I have never
experienced anything

02:37.225 --> 02:38.526
like this before in my life.

02:38.559 --> 02:41.028
I mean, I knew that the prince
was a romantic in person,

02:41.061 --> 02:42.563
but on the phone--

02:42.596 --> 02:43.397
za-boom!

02:46.567 --> 02:48.436
So what kind of
stuff does he say?

02:48.469 --> 02:49.337
Well, you know.

02:49.370 --> 02:50.504
Just stuff.

02:50.538 --> 02:51.839
Come on.

02:51.872 --> 02:54.608
I had to listen to every detail
about how boring Fred was.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.344
Now I want to hear
about the royal stud.

02:56.377 --> 02:59.647
Well, he said that
he wanted to be my--

03:04.685 --> 03:06.554
so that he could be with me.

03:06.587 --> 03:09.323
I mean, really with
me all day long.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.030
That has got to be
the grossest thing

03:17.064 --> 03:19.267
I have ever heard in my life.

03:19.300 --> 03:22.670
Boy, you picked yourself
a real winner there.

03:22.703 --> 03:25.306
Uh, so his Dan
called you lately?

03:25.339 --> 03:27.140
Yes, he has.

03:27.174 --> 03:31.412
Oh, not like that, but yeah.

03:31.445 --> 03:33.514
Man, I miss him so much.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.449
I know you do.

03:35.483 --> 03:38.486
You know, every morning I
get up and he's not there,

03:38.519 --> 03:41.655
and just for a second, I
think he's in the bathroom.

03:41.689 --> 03:44.692
But then I see that "TV Guide"
and that yellow highlighter,

03:44.725 --> 03:45.926
and I know he's not
in the bathroom.

03:45.959 --> 03:47.561
He's still out in
California with his mom.

03:47.595 --> 03:50.163
JACKIE: Well, he'll be
back in a couple weeks.

03:50.197 --> 03:52.333
Yeah, I know, but it's
still tough, you know?

03:52.366 --> 03:55.736
We've never been apart this
long in our whole relationship.

03:55.769 --> 03:59.940
And I mean, I feel like I--

03:59.973 --> 04:02.042
I've changed, you know?

04:02.075 --> 04:03.677
I made all my own decisions.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.346
I went wherever I wanted
to go with whoever

04:05.379 --> 04:07.180
I wanted to go with.

04:07.214 --> 04:08.882
I was like, totally on my own.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.118
Now I'm a little nervous
about when Dan comes back

04:11.151 --> 04:14.355
and I go back to making the
decisions for both of us again.

04:14.388 --> 04:17.858
Well, you know, you'll bark
him down a couple of times,

04:17.891 --> 04:20.428
and after a few days, everything
will be back to normal.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.329
Yeah.

04:21.362 --> 04:22.563
I don't know, though.

04:22.596 --> 04:25.533
I just-- I feel really
nervous about him seeing me.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.100
You've been
married for 25 years.

04:27.134 --> 04:28.336
Yeah, I know.

04:28.369 --> 04:30.270
But that whole time, I just
kept him here in Lanford

04:30.304 --> 04:31.372
all isolated, you know?

04:31.405 --> 04:33.441
And he's been out in
California, you know?

04:33.474 --> 04:35.776
And he comes back here and
see me in a different way.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.611
Where is all this coming from?

04:37.645 --> 04:38.879
I don't know.

04:38.912 --> 04:41.214
Just-- I just got
a weird feeling.

04:41.248 --> 04:43.417
[music playing]

04:43.451 --> 04:45.786
Let's go see
Barbara's movie tonight.

04:45.819 --> 04:48.288
She was so great on Oprah.

04:48.322 --> 04:50.023
You know, remember after
we saw "A Star is Born,"

04:50.057 --> 04:51.258
we got out and
got our hair all--

04:51.291 --> 04:53.427
Oh, two hands on
the wheel, please!

04:53.461 --> 04:55.262
Fine, I got it.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.097
I am feeling a little anxious.

04:57.130 --> 05:00.434
My mother is not the
easiest person to talk to.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.102
Maybe we ought to
turn the car around.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.070
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

05:03.103 --> 05:04.638
No, Bev, you're
just a bit confused,

05:04.672 --> 05:06.139
and it's perfectly natural.

05:06.173 --> 05:09.042
You've kept this thing
hidden for such a long time.

05:09.076 --> 05:12.413
I remember when I had the
talk with my parents, OK?

05:12.446 --> 05:14.415
And there was a long,
awkward silence,

05:14.448 --> 05:16.384
and then my mother just
turned to my father

05:16.417 --> 05:18.452
and said, "You owe me $10."

05:18.486 --> 05:20.888
Oh!

05:20.921 --> 05:22.423
Mine didn't even
go that smoothly.

05:22.456 --> 05:25.225
My father would not talk
to me for five years.

05:25.258 --> 05:26.660
Every Thanksgiving,
he would turn

05:26.694 --> 05:30.498
the TV set away so I couldn't
watch the football games.

05:30.531 --> 05:31.399
That's horrible.

05:31.432 --> 05:32.700
What about your mother?

05:32.733 --> 05:35.536
Oh, once a mama's boy,
always a mama's boy.

05:35.569 --> 05:36.770
SCOTT: Oh, stop.

05:36.804 --> 05:37.938
We're almost there.

05:37.971 --> 05:38.872
LEON: Oh, OK.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.441
Just turn left
at that stop sign.

05:40.474 --> 05:41.542
Left it is.

05:41.575 --> 05:42.876
Tell us when to pull in.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.945
Oh, you'll, uh,
recognize the house.

05:44.978 --> 05:45.779
Whoa.

05:48.616 --> 05:51.051
What in the name
of Brian Boitano?

05:54.321 --> 05:57.324
Get a load of all
those pink flamingos!

05:57.357 --> 05:59.660
What is that thing in
the middle of the yard?

05:59.693 --> 06:01.429
It looks like a
giant windmill made

06:01.462 --> 06:04.465
out of Campbell's soup cans.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.734
That's the place.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.001
Whoa.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.504
Think we'd better
lock it up, fellas.

06:10.538 --> 06:12.005
[music playing]

06:12.039 --> 06:13.006
[knocking at door]

06:13.040 --> 06:14.742
BEVERLY: Hello?

06:14.775 --> 06:15.643
Give me a minute.

06:15.676 --> 06:19.480
I've got my clothes on.

06:19.513 --> 06:21.949
Mother, it's Bev, and I
brought along some guests.

06:21.982 --> 06:22.850
Hello.

06:22.883 --> 06:23.884
Hello!

06:23.917 --> 06:25.519
How are you guys?

06:25.553 --> 06:26.787
Hi.
Welcome.

06:26.820 --> 06:27.688
Welcome.

06:27.721 --> 06:28.756
Thank you.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.724
Mary, is that a real
windmill out there?

06:30.758 --> 06:33.461
You can bet your ass it is.

06:33.494 --> 06:37.030
Listen, I brought it
from Amsterdam right

06:37.064 --> 06:39.199
after the Spanish Civil War.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.501
Wow.

06:40.534 --> 06:43.804
It used to be in my bedroom
when I was a little girl.

06:43.837 --> 06:46.574
Mother, I see the place
hasn't changed much.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.341
Yeah, it sure is interesting.

06:48.375 --> 06:49.743
Oh, you like it, Leon?

06:49.777 --> 06:55.583
Well, it-- it does explain
where Roseanne gets her tastes.

06:55.616 --> 07:00.287
I absolutely love
this old trunk.

07:00.320 --> 07:03.190
Ornate, yet carved.

07:03.223 --> 07:07.695
Oh, I-- I traded Meyer Lansky,
the famous gangster, for it.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.062
No!

07:09.096 --> 07:13.534
Mother's wild stories that
everyone has heard 1,000 times.

07:13.567 --> 07:14.434
No!

07:14.468 --> 07:15.803
Not here!

07:15.836 --> 07:19.072
Not a block off the highway
in the middle of corn country!

07:19.106 --> 07:20.173
Oh, my!

07:20.207 --> 07:21.074
LEON: Scott!

07:21.108 --> 07:22.910
Oh, my!

07:22.943 --> 07:23.977
I feel faint.

07:24.011 --> 07:24.912
Give me air.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.981
Give me air, honey.

07:28.015 --> 07:31.785
Mary, do not tell me that
that is an authentic Picasso.

07:31.819 --> 07:34.054
It'd better be a real Picasso.

07:34.087 --> 07:36.524
I posed nude for
that for four days.

07:36.557 --> 07:37.658
Got pneumonia.

07:37.691 --> 07:40.393
Oh, that old letch.

07:40.427 --> 07:42.763
Oh, like you knew Picasso.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.798
Give me a big break.

07:44.832 --> 07:47.835
Here's what I'd
like to give you.

07:47.868 --> 07:48.869
Scott, let's go antiquing.

07:48.902 --> 07:49.770
Now?

07:49.803 --> 07:51.071
Yes, right now.

07:51.104 --> 07:54.642
I love it when
you're impulsive.

07:54.675 --> 07:57.344
I just think there's a
Gustav Stickley rocking chair

07:57.377 --> 07:58.979
out there with our names on it.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.648
I bet she slept with Picasso.

08:00.681 --> 08:03.884
In a Cubist second.

08:03.917 --> 08:04.785
All right, Beverly.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.019
What the hell you doing here?

08:06.053 --> 08:10.524
You haven't been here for,
uh-- were you ever here?

08:10.558 --> 08:12.425
Yes, but it's
been a long time.

08:12.459 --> 08:15.195
Actually, I thought
we might, uh, chat.

08:15.228 --> 08:16.229
OK.

08:16.263 --> 08:17.064
Let's chat.

08:20.333 --> 08:24.905
You and I have never had
a mother-daughter talk,

08:24.938 --> 08:29.543
and now that I am all grown
up, I think it's time we did.

08:29.577 --> 08:34.381
Oh, God, I was hoping to
postpone it for another decade.

08:34.414 --> 08:35.382
Mother!

08:35.415 --> 08:36.784
Yeah, what?

08:36.817 --> 08:40.688
Well, you see, I am at a-- at
a-- at a crossroads in my life.

08:40.721 --> 08:44.357
I mean, I just don't
know where I'm going.

08:44.391 --> 08:47.160
Ever since I blurted
out to the world

08:47.194 --> 08:49.396
that I'm attracted to women--

08:49.429 --> 08:52.432
When did you do this?

08:52.465 --> 08:54.434
Thanksgiving.

08:54.467 --> 08:56.436
Thanksgiving-- oh,
yeah, I was there.

08:56.469 --> 08:57.971
I remember.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.873
I've realized that
my whole life is

08:59.907 --> 09:02.342
just one mistake after another.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.243
Oh, man.

09:03.276 --> 09:04.077
That really sucks.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.952
It's true, Mom.

09:11.985 --> 09:14.622
I quit secretarial
school, despite the fact

09:14.655 --> 09:16.556
that I excelled in stenography.

09:16.590 --> 09:17.625
MARY: Yes.

09:17.658 --> 09:20.027
I married the first
man who came along.

09:20.060 --> 09:23.396
You married the first
mutt that came along.

09:23.430 --> 09:27.567
Mother, I came here in search
of answers, not criticism.

09:27.601 --> 09:29.369
That is not criticism.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.439
That was a commentary.

09:32.472 --> 09:34.174
Mother, I came here for help.

09:34.207 --> 09:37.645
I thought you could perhaps
give me some hint, some clue,

09:37.678 --> 09:40.981
something to help me
understand myself.

09:41.014 --> 09:43.817
Bev, you are a
rebel, just like me.

09:43.851 --> 09:47.020
You just had different
things to rebel against.

09:47.054 --> 09:48.421
What are you babbling about?

09:48.455 --> 09:49.322
All right.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.625
Sit down.

09:51.659 --> 09:54.995
Now, remember when I used
to get drunk with Hemingway?

09:55.028 --> 09:56.329
I wasn't there.

09:56.363 --> 09:57.798
Well, you remember.

09:57.831 --> 10:03.637
And I used to go smoke reefers
in Harlem with the jazz crowd.

10:03.671 --> 10:08.776
Well, you were rebelling against
the woman that I was then.

10:08.809 --> 10:13.180
You became that kind of
uptight, repressed conformist.

10:13.213 --> 10:16.850
Does any of this
help you, honey?

10:16.884 --> 10:19.953
I was not uptight
and repressed.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.554
I was a realist.

10:21.588 --> 10:22.823
Someone had to be.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.392
All you did was wake me up
in the middle of the night

10:25.425 --> 10:29.062
so we could skip out on the
rent and move on to another town

10:29.096 --> 10:32.565
or move on to another boyfriend.

10:32.599 --> 10:34.334
I never know where
we were gonna live.

10:34.367 --> 10:35.903
I never went to the same school.

10:35.936 --> 10:38.271
I never knew when you'd
come home at night.

10:38.305 --> 10:41.274
You were mentally unstable.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.876
No, Beverly.

10:42.910 --> 10:47.647
What I was was what they
used to call a free spirit.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.049
Yes, I was.

10:49.082 --> 10:52.485
You know, I had you very young,
so I parked you with my mother

10:52.519 --> 10:55.255
for a couple of years.

10:55.288 --> 10:58.291
But when I came back, there
was no running around.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.226
Come on.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.861
You went to the
same school then,

11:00.894 --> 11:02.830
and you slept in the same bed.

11:02.863 --> 11:07.467
And I did every menial
job that came along.

11:07.500 --> 11:11.671
I gave up all my dreams of
being an artiste, a ballerina,

11:11.705 --> 11:16.176
a writer, a union organizer.

11:16.209 --> 11:17.244
Come on, Beverly.

11:17.277 --> 11:20.547
All I got left are my treasures.

11:20.580 --> 11:21.715
You know it.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.784
I wasn't a bad mother.

11:23.817 --> 11:27.054
I never said you
were a bad mother.

11:27.087 --> 11:31.524
Well, kiddo, you certainly
were hinting at it.

11:31.558 --> 11:34.394
Mom, I've asked
you this before

11:34.427 --> 11:36.563
and you've always avoided it.

11:36.596 --> 11:37.497
Who was my father?

11:41.401 --> 11:42.469
You know what?

11:42.502 --> 11:45.538
I'm-- I'm going to make
us some sandwiches.

11:45.572 --> 11:48.441
[music playing]

11:51.511 --> 11:54.547
Both Jerry and Andy
are down for their naps.

11:54.581 --> 11:57.217
I think this baby thing
is going to be a breeze.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.618
You just remember
that when I'm in labor

11:58.651 --> 12:01.889
and I'm ripping your throat out.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.190
What are you guys doing?

12:03.223 --> 12:06.026
Well, I unloaded
the, uh, dishwasher,

12:06.059 --> 12:09.162
and I listened to Aunt Jackie
get an obscene phone call,

12:09.196 --> 12:12.800
and I was sitting here
thinking about Dad.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.903
Hey, did you tell him about
all the remodeling you did yet?

12:15.936 --> 12:17.938
Well, no, not all of
it because, you know,

12:17.971 --> 12:20.874
it's supposed to be a great
big surprise when he gets here.

12:20.908 --> 12:21.775
Huh.

12:21.809 --> 12:23.710
You think so?

12:23.743 --> 12:24.812
Well, Yeah.

12:24.845 --> 12:27.280
We got new cupboards,
the new table here,

12:27.314 --> 12:31.384
the convection oven,
whatever the hell that is.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.320
Well, uh, what
about the living room?

12:33.353 --> 12:35.288
What about it?

12:35.322 --> 12:36.523
[music playing]

12:36.556 --> 12:45.398
Well, I don't think Dad
can even fit in this chair.

12:45.432 --> 12:46.399
Well, so what?

12:46.433 --> 12:47.868
He'll sit someplace else.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.302
All right, everybody get out.

12:49.336 --> 12:52.239
You're ruining my
surround sound.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.073
Mute.

12:55.708 --> 12:56.776
No, Mom.

12:56.810 --> 12:59.679
It just doesn't seem
like Dad's taste to me.

12:59.712 --> 13:01.648
Darlene, this is
the first furniture

13:01.681 --> 13:06.219
we have ever had that we did
not buy off of somebody's lawn.

13:06.253 --> 13:08.221
Well, yeah, but is it Dad?

13:08.255 --> 13:10.723
Well, of course it is.

13:10.757 --> 13:12.425
Isn't it?

13:12.459 --> 13:14.928
Well, some of the old
stuff was, uh, a little more,

13:14.962 --> 13:19.799
uh, you know, uh, guy friendly.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.368
This is totally guy friendly.

13:21.401 --> 13:24.637
You just can't tell
because it's still clean.

13:24.671 --> 13:25.738
I don't think
you have anything

13:25.772 --> 13:27.240
to worry about, Mrs. Connor.

13:27.274 --> 13:28.675
I mean, look at me.

13:28.708 --> 13:31.611
I'm a guy, and I
love this new stuff.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.445
I'm screwed.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.518
See, now you've got me
all unsure of myself

13:38.551 --> 13:39.887
and feeling all nervous.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.121
Tell me the truth, Jackie.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.055
What do you really think?

13:42.089 --> 13:42.956
Well--

13:42.990 --> 13:43.857
[phone ringing]
I got it.

13:43.891 --> 13:44.757
No!

13:44.791 --> 13:45.725
I got it!

13:45.758 --> 13:46.826
You know it's for me anyway.

13:46.860 --> 13:47.727
Give it to me.

13:47.760 --> 13:48.561
No!

13:54.601 --> 13:55.402
Hello?

13:58.271 --> 14:00.207
No, actually, I
wouldn't like that.

14:04.211 --> 14:05.145
Hello?

14:05.178 --> 14:06.613
[giggling]

14:06.646 --> 14:09.482
[music playing]

14:12.019 --> 14:13.553
[shriek]

14:13.586 --> 14:14.454
Beverly!

14:14.487 --> 14:16.689
You're still here?

14:16.723 --> 14:17.690
Of course I'm still here.

14:17.724 --> 14:19.059
Remember?

14:19.092 --> 14:22.062
You just went into the kitchen
to make us some sandwiches.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.730
Oh, that's right.

14:23.763 --> 14:25.532
Well, you're welcome to half.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.700
But, uh, I'm warning you, I--

14:27.734 --> 14:31.804
I sprinkled my
Metamucil all over it.

14:31.838 --> 14:34.074
I'm not really hungry anyway.

14:34.107 --> 14:38.711
Mother, you have not
answered my question.

14:38.745 --> 14:41.048
Who was my father?

14:41.081 --> 14:43.116
Bev, let me tell you a story.

14:43.150 --> 14:45.018
Sit down.

14:45.052 --> 14:50.590
Uh, there was this party
at a mansion in Paris, OK?

14:50.623 --> 14:53.994
And-- no, maybe it
was at a restaurant.

14:54.027 --> 14:59.066
Anyway, coming towards me
was this handsome actor.

14:59.099 --> 15:03.536
Remember, he used to swing from
the trees in those pictures?

15:03.570 --> 15:04.704
[stammering]

15:04.737 --> 15:05.973
Tarzan?
- Tarzan?

15:06.006 --> 15:07.174
Yeah!

15:07.207 --> 15:09.209
Now you're telling me
that Tarzan was my father?

15:09.242 --> 15:11.311
Johnny Weissmuller?

15:11.344 --> 15:12.212
Yeah.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.747
Mother, no more stories.

15:14.781 --> 15:17.717
I don't know who my father is.

15:17.750 --> 15:18.751
Well, then we're even.

15:18.785 --> 15:19.652
I don't know either.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.557
You really don't know?

15:24.591 --> 15:25.892
No.

15:25.925 --> 15:30.663
I narrowed it down to four
guys, really only two, because--

15:30.697 --> 15:34.467
I mean, you have no talent for
art, so it couldn't be Picasso.

15:34.501 --> 15:37.770
You can't play the piano, so
it can't be Arthur Rubenstein.

15:37.804 --> 15:38.871
Well, I can sing.

15:38.905 --> 15:42.575
Could it be Louis Armstrong?

15:42.609 --> 15:44.844
That is a distinct
possibility.

15:44.877 --> 15:46.146
Mother.

15:46.179 --> 15:47.814
All right.

15:47.847 --> 15:49.282
Come on, Bev.

15:49.316 --> 15:53.020
You've got to remember that
this life is a banquet.

15:53.053 --> 15:55.688
You got to learn how to
take big bites out of it.

15:55.722 --> 15:56.789
I love you.

15:56.823 --> 15:59.959
I love you, but get
the hell off my back.

15:59.993 --> 16:02.162
I need help!

16:02.195 --> 16:04.231
Honey, listen to me.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.733
Everybody goes down
a different road.

16:06.766 --> 16:10.270
It doesn't matter what the
hell other people think.

16:10.303 --> 16:13.540
To thine own self be true.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.008
Shakespeare said that.

16:15.042 --> 16:17.744
Or maybe it was in the Bible.

16:17.777 --> 16:18.878
Oh, no, I know.

16:18.911 --> 16:21.781
It was Steve Allen.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.616
Here, have a cigar.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.452
I don't smoke.

16:25.485 --> 16:28.655
Oh, well, Castro
gave me these cigars.

16:28.688 --> 16:29.922
Yeah, when?

16:29.956 --> 16:32.292
Oh, yeah, New York,
a long time ago.

16:32.325 --> 16:35.462
He was doing the
"Jack Paar Show."

16:35.495 --> 16:37.530
That cigar box is lovely.

16:37.564 --> 16:39.432
It would be perfect
for potpourri.

16:39.466 --> 16:41.601
Yeah?
You like it?

16:41.634 --> 16:42.835
I do.

16:42.869 --> 16:43.970
Have it.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.772
You know, there's a lot
of other stuff around

16:45.805 --> 16:47.707
here I'd like you to
have, but I didn't

16:47.740 --> 16:49.676
think you liked any of it.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.411
I liked it. .

16:51.444 --> 16:53.980
I just didn't want
you to know it.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.616
Why?

16:56.649 --> 16:58.285
Maybe I really am a rebel.

16:58.318 --> 16:59.786
You know, in
this life there are

16:59.819 --> 17:03.356
more questions than answers.

17:03.390 --> 17:06.859
Maybe it's meant to be that
way so it keeps us on our toes.

17:06.893 --> 17:07.827
You know, Mom?

17:07.860 --> 17:08.728
What?

17:08.761 --> 17:10.263
Thanks.

17:10.297 --> 17:13.266
You're welcome.

17:13.300 --> 17:14.667
You're OK, kiddo.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.970
[music playing]

17:22.375 --> 17:23.343
OK, Jackie.

17:23.376 --> 17:24.177
What do you think?

17:27.247 --> 17:29.516
Roseanne, it's a
little revealing.

17:29.549 --> 17:30.883
I know.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.919
I bought it for when Dan comes
home to distract him in case

17:32.952 --> 17:35.822
he don't like the furniture.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.790
Well, it works
because I'm your sister,

17:37.824 --> 17:41.728
and even I can't keep
my eyes off your rack.

17:41.761 --> 17:44.364
Well, it's common
knowledge, Jackie.

17:44.397 --> 17:47.967
Men prefer boobs over
end tables any day.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.837
[doorbell ringing]

18:01.181 --> 18:03.583
[door slamming shut]

18:03.616 --> 18:08.755
It's real roses, Jackie, look,
not the hundred for $5 roses.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.223
Carlos!

18:10.257 --> 18:12.192
He is so romantic.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.461
What in the hell makes you
think they're from Carlos?

18:14.494 --> 18:16.996
Because your husband
wouldn't send you any flowers.

18:17.029 --> 18:19.399
Oh, yeah, but your
dirty mouth prince would.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.001
Yes, he would!

18:22.034 --> 18:23.035
[laughter]

18:23.069 --> 18:23.870
Get off!

18:28.341 --> 18:29.976
I can't wait to see you, honey.

18:30.009 --> 18:30.943
Oh, ho, ho.

18:30.977 --> 18:33.246
There's no place like home.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.247
They're for me!

18:37.250 --> 18:39.586
Can't wait to see you, honey.
There's no place like home.

18:39.619 --> 18:40.420
Love, Dan.

18:44.857 --> 18:45.758
Oh, my God.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.160
Dan's expecting home.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.261
I mean, like the old home.

18:48.295 --> 18:49.662
You know what I mean?

18:49.696 --> 18:52.932
Oh, like the coffee table with
the beer can stains on it home.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.301
My God.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.135
I got to get some of the things
that he used to like and put

18:56.169 --> 18:57.337
them back out here,
and maybe that'd

18:57.370 --> 18:59.872
help ease his way into the new.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.508
Oh, is this your I'm
going to be a grandma look?

19:04.444 --> 19:05.812
Hey, Darlene?

19:05.845 --> 19:08.481
We didn't get rid of that dogs
playing poker picture, did we?

19:08.515 --> 19:11.651
Believe it or not, somebody
stole it out of the garage.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.486
Go figure.

19:13.520 --> 19:14.487
We're gonna have to have it.

19:14.521 --> 19:15.622
Your dad loved it.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.457
Mrs. Connor, you--
you do know that

19:17.490 --> 19:21.394
that was just a reproduction?

19:21.428 --> 19:23.196
Where can I get another one?

19:23.230 --> 19:26.666
Have you checked the
Lanford House of Velvet?

19:26.699 --> 19:27.567
You know, I--

19:27.600 --> 19:28.935
I could paint you another one.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.470
I could probably do
it just from memory.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.371
Really?

19:31.404 --> 19:32.372
Yeah, sure.

19:32.405 --> 19:33.773
Yeah.

19:33.806 --> 19:36.943
It's one of those images that
sears itself into your cornea.

19:36.976 --> 19:38.611
I'll go get started.

19:38.645 --> 19:41.548
Oh, my God, Jackie, I
am just totally nervous.

19:41.581 --> 19:43.716
Everything in the house
is just too different.

19:43.750 --> 19:44.917
I mean, including me.

19:44.951 --> 19:47.720
Ever since I went to that
spa, I look different.

19:47.754 --> 19:49.756
No, you don't.

19:49.789 --> 19:52.091
Sure she does.

19:52.124 --> 19:53.260
Her hair's shinier.

19:53.293 --> 19:54.527
Oh, yeah.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.463
If there's one thing Dad
cares about, it's shiny hair.

19:59.065 --> 20:01.934
Well, all I know,
Jackie, is that Dan is not

20:01.968 --> 20:06.172
going to be returning to the
demure little Lanford hausfrau

20:06.205 --> 20:07.774
that he left behind.

20:07.807 --> 20:08.675
I've been out in the world.

20:08.708 --> 20:09.976
I've lived.

20:10.009 --> 20:11.244
I've traveled.

20:11.278 --> 20:12.745
I've experienced
a million things.

20:12.779 --> 20:15.748
I've got a
self-defrosting freezer.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.650
And there is that little
matter of the terrorists.

20:17.684 --> 20:19.085
My God, Jackie.

20:19.118 --> 20:21.087
What kind of a man wants
to sleep with a woman

20:21.120 --> 20:22.555
who's thrown a man off a train?

20:22.589 --> 20:23.556
Roseanne!

20:23.590 --> 20:25.858
Get a hold of yourself.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.761
Dan doesn't care
about that stuff.

20:28.795 --> 20:31.831
All he's ever wanted, really,
is just a place to sit.

20:31.864 --> 20:32.732
My God.

20:32.765 --> 20:35.468
And I gave that away.

20:35.502 --> 20:38.605
Dan doesn't care how fancy
all your crap has gotten.

20:38.638 --> 20:39.672
He just wants you here.

20:39.706 --> 20:40.807
You know that.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.008
- What if--
- No.

20:42.041 --> 20:42.975
Just stop.
What if?

20:43.009 --> 20:44.311
What if?
What if?

20:44.344 --> 20:45.445
What if cars ran on spit?

20:48.281 --> 20:49.982
You know what Nana Mary says.

20:50.016 --> 20:51.684
There will always
be more questions

20:51.718 --> 20:54.754
than answers in this life.

20:54.787 --> 20:55.955
Here you go.

20:55.988 --> 20:57.724
I sketched out that picture
of the dogs for you.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.992
That poodle looks
a little like Becky.

21:00.026 --> 21:02.261
David!

21:02.295 --> 21:04.030
He do that from memory.

21:04.063 --> 21:05.532
It's perfect.

21:05.565 --> 21:06.799
What are you, crazy?

21:06.833 --> 21:08.200
It's not even close.

21:08.234 --> 21:10.503
The bulldog is supposed
to have the full house,

21:10.537 --> 21:14.040
and the chihuahua has the pair.

21:14.073 --> 21:14.941
So?

21:14.974 --> 21:16.609
The bulldog has to win.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.210
That's the whole
point of the painting!

21:20.913 --> 21:22.382
Oh, my God.
I know what.

21:22.415 --> 21:23.316
Oh, I know.

21:23.350 --> 21:24.517
I've got something
in the bedroom

21:24.551 --> 21:26.118
that'll make Dan really,
really excited to be home.

21:26.152 --> 21:27.019
JACKIE: Oh, God.

21:27.053 --> 21:28.020
OK.

21:28.054 --> 21:31.358
It's another eye-popping
cleavage outfit.

21:31.391 --> 21:32.325
Huh?

21:32.359 --> 21:33.259
Here we go.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.160
Huh?

21:34.193 --> 21:35.395
Yeah?

21:35.428 --> 21:36.996
I'm going to put this right
back on the mantelpiece

21:37.029 --> 21:39.866
over the-- oh, God!

21:39.899 --> 21:41.167
I got rid of the fireplace!

21:41.200 --> 21:44.136
