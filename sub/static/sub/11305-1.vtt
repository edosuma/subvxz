WEBVTT

00:11.887 --> 00:13.628
How'd it go?

00:13.805 --> 00:15.592
That bathroom's
a crime against humanity.

00:15.766 --> 00:17.553
Trust me. Put down the coffee.

00:17.726 --> 00:19.012
It's gone cold anyways.

00:19.186 --> 00:22.099
Never gone this long
between hipster coffee shops.

00:22.272 --> 00:24.059
First time out West?

00:25.150 --> 00:27.437
- Next stop's mine.
- You live here?

00:29.446 --> 00:30.982
No, not anymore.

00:31.156 --> 00:33.990
Funeral. My uncle's.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.743
I'm Kiersten.

00:37.913 --> 00:40.155
What'd you say
your name was again?

00:44.503 --> 00:46.540
There's so many of them!

00:46.713 --> 00:48.375
You said they can't
attack the house!

00:48.549 --> 00:50.791
- They got around the bedrock!
- I got the gun, Daddy.

00:50.968 --> 00:52.654
Let's close our eyes
and sing Mama's lullaby.

00:52.678 --> 00:54.635
Just until the bad guys go away.

00:54.805 --> 00:55.805
Daddy!

00:57.933 --> 01:00.220
Oh, Christ!

01:00.394 --> 01:02.681
That's it, I'm gonna burst.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.813
No.

01:05.983 --> 01:09.476
Time to introduce chestnut latte
to the badlands.

01:09.653 --> 01:11.895
Kiersten?

01:12.072 --> 01:13.654
Don't go out there.

01:13.824 --> 01:14.824
Why?

01:14.992 --> 01:16.824
It's dark.

01:16.994 --> 01:19.828
Pretty and smart.
We're gonna get along just fine.

01:44.021 --> 01:45.978
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

01:46.148 --> 01:48.265
Whoa!

01:52.988 --> 01:54.320
Hello?

02:05.083 --> 02:06.745
- What's going on?
- Sit down.

02:06.918 --> 02:09.160
Everyone, sit down.
We're leaving.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.415
I've heard this before.

02:14.593 --> 02:16.300
- Wolves?
- Something's outside.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.006
Yeah, a passenger!

02:25.270 --> 02:27.887
- We have to do something.
- Yeah, drive!

02:28.065 --> 02:29.897
- Come on!
- We can't just leave her!

02:30.067 --> 02:32.024
You'd have to be nuts
to go out there.

02:32.194 --> 02:34.607
- Let's go!
- Come on!

02:50.837 --> 02:52.669
Assholes.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.253
Hey!

02:58.720 --> 03:00.882
If you hurt her, I'll kill you!

03:01.056 --> 03:03.890
Kiersten?

03:06.103 --> 03:10.063
Let her go! We're armed!

03:11.983 --> 03:13.975
Poorly.

03:26.081 --> 03:27.538
Oh, my God!

03:32.295 --> 03:34.753
Ahh! Ugh!

03:36.091 --> 03:38.083
Ahh!

03:40.178 --> 03:41.510
Ugh!

03:55.110 --> 03:57.568
What do you want from me?!

04:11.001 --> 04:12.412
Ugh!

04:26.933 --> 04:28.720
Head rush.

04:34.232 --> 04:35.894
Ah!

04:36.067 --> 04:37.729
Ahhh!

04:37.903 --> 04:40.020
AH!

05:06.181 --> 05:07.547
Welcome home, Wynonna.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.801
- Where exactly?
- Just outside the city limits.

05:45.971 --> 05:49.430
- And the cause again?
- Maybe... animal attack.

05:49.599 --> 05:52.012
- OK. And your name is?
- My name?

05:53.103 --> 05:54.890
Nope.

06:05.824 --> 06:09.488
Curtis was not a handsome man.

06:09.661 --> 06:12.620
When I first lay eyes on him
at the cookout,

06:12.789 --> 06:15.623
I said to my sister,

06:15.792 --> 06:18.455
"Just how closely related
are his parents?"

06:20.505 --> 06:23.418
But he was loyal.

06:23.592 --> 06:27.302
Traits folk nowadays
might find old-fashioned...

06:28.638 --> 06:30.004
boring.

06:30.181 --> 06:33.345
Thing is, with Curtis,

06:33.518 --> 06:35.384
I was never bored.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.394
Not once.

06:41.192 --> 06:42.979
What are you doing here?

06:45.739 --> 06:47.355
You're late, as usual.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.819
I'm so sorry, Gus.

06:49.993 --> 06:52.326
Thought you were in Spain.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.703
Greece, when I heard.

06:56.207 --> 06:59.416
Oh, listen, I know
Purgatory's country and all,

06:59.586 --> 07:02.249
but is it legal to bury your husband
in the garden?

07:03.423 --> 07:06.666
Only thing Curtis loved more than me
was his tomatoes.

07:06.843 --> 07:09.426
Who am I to separate soul mates?

07:11.264 --> 07:13.722
They said it was a stroke.

07:13.892 --> 07:15.178
Bullshit.

07:15.352 --> 07:17.685
He was still tossing hay bales
like a teenager.

07:17.854 --> 07:22.474
Champ was... with him,
but he didn't see what happened.

07:22.651 --> 07:24.108
Hardy "Rodeo Champ" Champ?

07:24.277 --> 07:25.984
Yeah. He's a good kid.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.156
Gus, when they found Curtis...

07:30.325 --> 07:33.159
was he still...

07:33.328 --> 07:34.864
intact?

07:35.038 --> 07:37.701
- Wynonna!
- I wanna find out what happened.

07:37.874 --> 07:39.490
He died.

07:39.668 --> 07:42.285
Please, Wynonna, let it go.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.704
For once.

07:46.007 --> 07:47.839
It was a really nice eulogy.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.171
Runaway? Whore?

07:50.345 --> 07:53.759
Who knows what kind of trouble
this girl got herself into?

07:53.932 --> 07:56.800
Spoken like a man
who finds a lot of dead girls.

07:56.977 --> 08:01.847
And you've had three of 'em
in the past six months.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.768
So you find...

08:08.822 --> 08:11.690
Kiersten's head yet?

08:11.866 --> 08:14.199
Which agency did you say
you were from?

08:14.369 --> 08:16.702
See those skid marks?

08:16.871 --> 08:18.487
This isn't the kill site.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.907
Driver said two of 'em
got off the bus.

08:21.084 --> 08:22.541
OK, so where's the other body?

08:22.711 --> 08:24.498
And these lacerations?

08:24.671 --> 08:26.503
Defensive wounds?

08:26.673 --> 08:28.790
Bite marks...

08:28.967 --> 08:30.458
from scavengers.

08:30.635 --> 08:33.001
We have an overpopulation
of coyotes this summer.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.465
Winter will thin out the pack.

08:34.639 --> 08:36.301
You plan to be here
that long, Mr...?

08:36.474 --> 08:37.806
Dolls.

08:37.976 --> 08:39.342
Deputy Marshal Dolls.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.476
And I'll be here
as long as it takes.

08:45.608 --> 08:50.069
Well, then welcome to
the bustling metropolis of Purgatory

08:50.238 --> 08:52.230
where nothing lives
but cattle and cowboys.

08:52.407 --> 08:54.865
And maybe...

08:57.120 --> 08:59.828
the occasional Greek goddess.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.961
What'll I tell the locals
happened out here?

09:07.130 --> 09:09.964
Runaway hooker. Coyote attack.

09:10.133 --> 09:13.217
Anything but the truth, right?

09:32.447 --> 09:34.905
Well, either I'm sucking fumes
out of the back

09:35.075 --> 09:37.237
of Willie Nelson's tour bus

09:37.410 --> 09:39.242
or Wynonna Earp
just walked into my bar.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.369
Hey, Shorty. How's business?

09:41.539 --> 09:43.622
Mechanical bull broke
a month ago.

09:43.792 --> 09:45.158
Chippendales night was a bust.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.998
Not to mention this shit
about a dead runaway.

09:48.171 --> 09:50.379
Rule number one -
never get off the bus.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.289
I did.

09:52.467 --> 09:54.129
You were...

09:55.178 --> 09:56.464
Did you tell the cops?

09:56.638 --> 09:59.847
Well, I mean,
I phoned it in, anonymously.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.757
Uh-huh.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.769
Two stints in juvie,
a summer riding with the Bandidos,

10:04.938 --> 10:07.305
and I'm still wanted for questioning
in the Bleaker case.

10:07.482 --> 10:10.316
My relationship
with law enforcement

10:10.485 --> 10:13.649
es un poco complicated.

10:13.822 --> 10:17.281
How about un poco
of liquid courage?

10:17.450 --> 10:19.533
Alright, just one, yeah.
I gotta focus.

10:19.702 --> 10:22.820
I'm here for Gus... and Curtis.

10:22.997 --> 10:25.455
Somebody knows
what really happened to my uncle.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.287
Where you been, Wynonna?

10:28.461 --> 10:30.043
As far from here as I could get.

10:30.213 --> 10:31.545
Lucky you.

10:31.714 --> 10:34.252
You know, if I could leave Purgatory,
I'd never come back.

10:36.136 --> 10:39.049
Why would Wyatt Earp choose
to settle in this shit-hole?

10:39.222 --> 10:41.839
My money's on
the deep gene pool.

10:42.016 --> 10:43.928
Well, maybe your
great-great-grandpappy

10:44.102 --> 10:46.890
got a few lucky shots in
at the O.K. Corral

10:47.063 --> 10:49.726
and fled before they found out
he was a FRAUD.

10:50.775 --> 10:52.892
Didn't he marry a whore?

10:54.195 --> 10:57.313
- An actress.
- Oh, ho, shit!

10:57.490 --> 10:59.009
She's probably the one
gave Doug Holliday

10:59.033 --> 11:00.865
the clap that done him in.

11:03.079 --> 11:03.910
Doc!

11:04.080 --> 11:06.242
Doc Holliday, dumb-ass.

11:06.416 --> 11:09.079
And it was tuberculosis
that killed him, you ignoramus.

11:09.252 --> 11:12.370
This coming from the pair of tits
so insane, so CURSED?

11:12.547 --> 11:13.879
What did you say?

11:14.048 --> 11:17.007
Getting beat up
by a girl again, Carl?

11:17.177 --> 11:18.713
Champ!

11:18.887 --> 11:21.004
My hero.

11:24.559 --> 11:25.390
Sweet.

11:25.560 --> 11:29.474
Listen, uh... I was hoping
I could talk to you...

11:29.647 --> 11:32.981
about what happened to my uncle.

11:33.151 --> 11:38.692
Bring those lips, we can, um...
'talk' all night long.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.738
You didn't pay me
a second glance in high school.

11:43.912 --> 11:46.325
Hey, you were kind of a freak.

11:46.497 --> 11:48.659
You have no idea.

11:49.792 --> 11:52.330
Well...

11:52.503 --> 11:55.166
Shorty lets you stay
above the bar, huh?

11:55.340 --> 11:57.172
Yeah, I, uh...

11:57.342 --> 11:58.799
got a key.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.676
Oh... that's impressive.

12:03.181 --> 12:04.888
Oof...

12:05.058 --> 12:07.596
So, um...

12:09.103 --> 12:12.767
you ran ranch security
with Curtis,

12:12.941 --> 12:16.059
but didn't bother
to make his service?

12:16.236 --> 12:18.228
Yeah, I, uh... I hate funerals.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.896
Ugh! Tell me about it.

12:22.200 --> 12:26.285
Gus mentioned you were
the one who found his body.

12:26.454 --> 12:29.413
- Yeah. Speaking of bodies...
- Hm?

12:29.582 --> 12:33.041
Mad hot.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.077
Alright, Champ.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.588
Yeah. Maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.093
Do you know what time it is?

12:43.263 --> 12:45.346
Yeah, time for you
to tell me how Curtis died.

12:45.515 --> 12:48.053
- He... he just did.
- Oh, no.

12:48.226 --> 12:50.934
- Don't make me get rough.
- This ain't rough?

12:51.104 --> 12:54.688
Look, uh, I heard screaming
and screaming, and I ran.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.189
Called the sheriff.

12:56.359 --> 12:58.640
And when they found him,
his head had been torn clean off!

13:01.114 --> 13:03.151
Listen, you washed-up
rodeo clown.

13:03.324 --> 13:04.656
Who did it?

13:04.826 --> 13:06.658
What did you see?

13:06.828 --> 13:08.660
Cattle mutilations,
lights in the hills,

13:08.830 --> 13:10.241
strange marks in the dirt.

13:10.415 --> 13:11.531
Owww!

13:11.708 --> 13:13.870
He died on your land, Wynonna!

13:14.043 --> 13:17.002
The homestead?

13:17.171 --> 13:19.254
Show me where.

13:19.424 --> 13:20.960
I'm not going back there.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.750
You're in this
with me now, 'Champ'.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.510
And no-one else is
gonna save you.

13:25.680 --> 13:30.050
Oh! Except his girlfriend,
you skank!

13:30.226 --> 13:32.559
Why don't you slip into
something more comfy, huh?

13:32.729 --> 13:33.970
Like a coma!

13:35.398 --> 13:37.765
Worst birthday ever!

13:38.901 --> 13:40.688
Wynonna?

13:42.697 --> 13:45.861
Hey, sis.

13:47.118 --> 13:50.282
You grew out your... hair.

13:54.709 --> 13:57.292
Did you plant
their birthday gifts?

13:57.462 --> 14:00.250
Oh, yeah.

14:00.423 --> 14:01.709
Oh, hey, Carl.

14:01.883 --> 14:05.342
I heard you talked
to Wynonna at Shorty's.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.127
Brought up the Earp curse.

14:07.305 --> 14:10.093
I didn't mean nothing.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.633
We can't have you
running off your mouth

14:12.810 --> 14:15.723
before we get what we need,
can we, pal?

14:15.897 --> 14:17.263
Come on, Malcolm...

14:17.440 --> 14:20.808
If you can't hold your tongue...

14:24.781 --> 14:27.694
Oh...

14:34.374 --> 14:36.411
I will.

14:36.584 --> 14:40.043
Now we stick to the plan,
then we kill the girls.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.045
Got it? Got it?

14:42.215 --> 14:43.376
Mm-hm.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.628
What are you doing in town?
I mean, besides my boyfriend?

14:49.806 --> 14:52.264
I wasn't gonna 'do' anyone,
least of all that man-child.

14:52.433 --> 14:54.244
I'm trying to find out
what happened to Curtis.

14:54.268 --> 14:55.600
Oh, and you can do better.

14:55.770 --> 14:57.557
Well, small town,
limited dating options.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.517
Yeah, I remember.

14:59.690 --> 15:00.976
- Hey!
- Ow!

15:01.150 --> 15:02.150
God!

15:02.235 --> 15:05.103
- What?
- It's been THREE YEARS.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.771
God! Come here!

15:07.949 --> 15:10.612
You couldn't tell me
you were coming?

15:10.785 --> 15:12.777
I wasn't.

15:12.954 --> 15:15.071
Then Uncle Curtis
sent me an email.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.240
What? What did it say?

15:17.417 --> 15:19.534
"They've caught up with me."

15:19.710 --> 15:21.793
I knew it wasn't a stroke.

15:21.963 --> 15:23.625
It's starting again, isn't it?

15:23.798 --> 15:25.209
We need that gun.

15:25.383 --> 15:27.591
- OK, I'm not doing this.
- Wyatt Earp's gun.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.880
- The same one disappeared...
- Never talk about that!

15:29.971 --> 15:32.213
- And I don't!
- Good!

15:32.390 --> 15:34.052
Best advice you ever gave me.

15:35.059 --> 15:37.972
- Well... only advice, really.
- Hey, I was a kid!

15:38.146 --> 15:41.605
OK? I couldn't... I couldn't
look after myself, let alone...

15:41.774 --> 15:44.016
What, your bratty little sister?

15:44.193 --> 15:46.560
You know, it's about the only thing
I've ever done right.

15:46.737 --> 15:48.854
- Leaving me behind?
- Yeah, it gave you a chance.

15:49.031 --> 15:52.149
Right... Yeah, well,
I'm not six anymore, OK?

15:52.326 --> 15:54.192
Look, I could help.

15:54.370 --> 15:57.078
We could fight this thing,
this curse together!

15:57.248 --> 15:59.365
Waverly, there is no curse on...

16:04.005 --> 16:05.462
Wynonna Earp?

16:07.216 --> 16:09.833
If my parole officer's asking,
then no.

16:10.011 --> 16:11.798
Is there somewhere
that we can go talk?

16:11.971 --> 16:13.428
We got your call.

16:13.598 --> 16:17.387
And I think that this...
belongs to you.

16:18.519 --> 16:22.058
So, you wanna tell me
exactly what happened on that bus?

16:23.858 --> 16:25.349
Am I being charged
with something?

16:25.526 --> 16:27.838
'Cause, trust me, having to ride the bus
is punishment enough.

16:27.862 --> 16:29.819
A girl is dead...

16:29.989 --> 16:31.651
Ms Earp.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.156
I had nothing to do with that.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.942
I know.

16:35.119 --> 16:37.611
I spoke to the bus driver.
He was scared.

16:37.788 --> 16:39.495
He said he heard something
that spooked him

16:39.665 --> 16:42.408
and that you and Kiersten were
the only ones that fled the bus.

16:42.585 --> 16:45.043
- I'm sorry. I'm, uh...
- Drunk?

16:45.213 --> 16:47.500
Lost.

16:47.673 --> 16:50.336
You FBI? I didn't quite
recognise the badge.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.738
And you've seen a lot of them
given your criminal record.

16:52.762 --> 16:54.448
Juvenile record, and that's
supposed to be sealed

16:54.472 --> 16:55.758
when an offender turns 18.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.594
And I'm 26...

16:57.767 --> 16:59.224
27.

16:59.393 --> 17:02.181
Happy birthday, by the way.

17:11.239 --> 17:13.356
US Marshals, huh?

17:13.532 --> 17:15.194
You don't have
jurisdiction up here.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.904
Cross-border task force.

17:17.078 --> 17:18.910
- What's with the charcoal star?
- Good eye.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.537
Denotes
the Black Badge Division.

17:20.705 --> 17:22.823
Is that some kind
of covert branch?

17:23.000 --> 17:24.332
We monitor
specific activity that

17:24.502 --> 17:26.164
has recently flared up
in this area.

17:26.337 --> 17:29.796
- What kind of activity?
- Unexplainable.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.505
I either need way more

17:34.679 --> 17:36.636
or way less of this stuff,
I'll tell ya.

17:36.806 --> 17:39.423
You know what I think, Earp?

17:39.600 --> 17:42.263
I think you saw
what killed Kiersten.

17:42.436 --> 17:44.723
Yeah, coyote. A big one.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.310
Is that the story
you're sticking with?

17:50.945 --> 17:52.311
Where'd your sister go?

17:52.488 --> 17:53.774
You leave her out of this.

17:53.948 --> 17:56.486
I just wanna thank her
for my coffee.

17:56.659 --> 17:58.525
You see, the thing is, Wynonna,

17:58.703 --> 18:00.703
our division doesn't really
see a lot of survivors,

18:00.746 --> 18:02.826
so any information that you have
on how you outran...

18:02.957 --> 18:04.243
- I got your card.
- OK.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.624
Thanks.

18:05.793 --> 18:07.625
I'm sure you get this
all the time,

18:07.795 --> 18:10.378
but is it like 'Earp' as in...

18:10.548 --> 18:12.164
Good ol' Wyatt. Yep.

18:12.341 --> 18:14.298
He was my
great-great-grandfather.

18:14.468 --> 18:17.211
The greatest gunslinger
that ever lived.

18:18.806 --> 18:21.093
You a good shot too?

18:22.268 --> 18:24.100
I don't do guns.

18:24.270 --> 18:27.058
Couldn't hit a lawman
at zero paces.

18:27.231 --> 18:28.722
Fortunately.

18:41.329 --> 18:42.945
He seems nice.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.830
As a swift kick to the box.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.536
So...

18:47.710 --> 18:49.622
your 27th birthday.

18:49.795 --> 18:52.538
- Doesn't mean anything, Waverly.
- Oh, yeah?

18:52.715 --> 18:54.547
Then why do you look so spooked?

18:54.717 --> 18:56.709
Huh?

18:58.596 --> 19:01.304
- Tell Gus I'm taking the truck.
- What?

19:01.474 --> 19:03.716
- Where are you going?
- Home.

19:53.401 --> 19:56.860
They say Wyatt took down
77 outlaws with this gun.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.029
And all those outlaws
are resurrecting as revenants

19:59.073 --> 20:00.530
coming for us.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.692
They won't rest
until they gain freedom

20:02.868 --> 20:04.154
from their earthly prison.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.240
- You'll stop them, Daddy!
- You'll get 'em.

20:06.414 --> 20:09.452
Willa's the eldest,
the next Earp heir

20:09.625 --> 20:11.582
destined to inherit
Wyatt's abilities.

20:11.752 --> 20:14.072
Because the only thing that can
put these demons down again

20:14.130 --> 20:15.337
is you.

20:17.341 --> 20:18.781
You said they can't
attack the house!

20:18.884 --> 20:20.696
They figured out how to get
around the bedrock!

20:20.720 --> 20:22.382
I got the gun!
There's so many of them!

20:22.555 --> 20:24.387
There's seven of them!

20:29.979 --> 20:32.096
Willa!

20:32.273 --> 20:34.435
- No!
- Shotgun won't work.

20:34.608 --> 20:37.567
He needs Wyatt's gun.

20:39.613 --> 20:41.855
- I won't let them hurt anyone.
- Good.

20:42.032 --> 20:44.352
Because the only thing that
can put these demons down again

20:44.493 --> 20:46.485
is you.

20:56.714 --> 20:58.125
Waverly was right.

20:58.299 --> 21:00.256
We need that gun.

21:02.636 --> 21:04.628
And I'm talking to my truck.

21:13.564 --> 21:15.055
Good news.

21:15.232 --> 21:17.315
She took the bait.

21:17.485 --> 21:19.772
She'll fetch it for us.

21:27.536 --> 21:30.153
Were you gonna ask
to borrow my stuff?

21:30.331 --> 21:33.415
I noticed you already
borrowed all my whiskey.

21:33.584 --> 21:36.167
I know. Curtis may have
stood for all that.

21:36.337 --> 21:39.171
But then he was soft on ya.

21:40.341 --> 21:41.798
He was a good man,

21:41.967 --> 21:44.254
and he deserved better
than what happened to him.

21:46.096 --> 21:48.088
Something took his head, Gus.

21:48.265 --> 21:50.222
- Something or someone.
- No.

21:50.392 --> 21:52.258
Wynonna...

21:52.436 --> 21:55.725
Well, I know who killed him,
and I got a plan.

21:55.898 --> 21:57.685
That's not what I meant.

21:57.858 --> 22:00.851
You got that wild look
in your eyes.

22:01.028 --> 22:02.519
Manic, paranoid.

22:02.696 --> 22:06.440
Probably off your meds, hm?
What's next?

22:06.617 --> 22:08.358
More demons?

22:09.453 --> 22:11.069
Jesus...

22:11.247 --> 22:13.330
Yeah, I might be certifiable.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.491
Got the paperwork to prove it.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.955
But something awful is
happening in Purgatory,

22:18.128 --> 22:20.336
and it has everything
to do with my last name!

22:20.506 --> 22:22.543
You're not
the only Earp in town.

22:22.716 --> 22:24.799
Waverly has worked so hard

22:24.969 --> 22:27.837
just to get out
from under your shadow.

22:31.141 --> 22:33.679
I know it's your birthday, so...

22:33.853 --> 22:35.845
Don't worry about that.

22:38.065 --> 22:40.307
Enough for a one-way ticket
back to Athens.

22:41.819 --> 22:45.859
- So this is your gift for me?
- And for your sister.

22:47.116 --> 22:50.109
I love you, Wynonna...

22:50.286 --> 22:54.075
but you're as broken
as they come.

23:17.438 --> 23:18.974
Hello, Earp.

23:19.148 --> 23:21.014
Thirsty?

23:22.526 --> 23:25.610
No. This old well dried up
a long time ago.

23:25.779 --> 23:27.645
Much like my tolerance
for stalkers.

23:27.823 --> 23:29.610
No, really,
are you following me?

23:29.783 --> 23:31.194
Happened to be driving by.

23:31.368 --> 23:33.325
- Well, if you wanted a date...
- I don't.

23:33.495 --> 23:34.326
Ouch.

23:34.496 --> 23:37.409
But I might be the one person
that could help ya.

23:37.583 --> 23:39.943
Thanks, but I'm more of
a make-everything-worse kind of gal.

23:40.085 --> 23:41.371
Oh, it's gonna get worse.

23:41.545 --> 23:43.982
You think the thing that killed Kiersten
is gonna let you live?

23:44.006 --> 23:46.589
Not if I'm already gone.

23:46.759 --> 23:49.752
- Earp, I know what you know.
- OK.

23:49.929 --> 23:53.218
Well, you don't know ME, Deputy.

23:53.390 --> 23:55.097
Talk to the locals,
they'll tell ya.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.179
Yeah, that you're mental,
a bad seed. Mm-hm.

23:57.353 --> 23:59.891
Oh, they forgot
scary-good in bed.

24:00.064 --> 24:02.226
What do you want from me?

24:02.399 --> 24:05.107
I need someone that knows
the area, its people.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.109
I want you to join my squad,

24:07.279 --> 24:10.067
work for the right side
of the law for once.

24:15.079 --> 24:16.911
You must be desperate.

24:17.081 --> 24:18.947
- The situation's desperate.
- OK, well...

24:19.124 --> 24:20.831
I don't do authority, alright?

24:21.001 --> 24:22.867
These days, I barely do sober.

24:27.216 --> 24:28.548
Then I recruit Waverly.

24:28.717 --> 24:31.551
- People in town rave about her.
- I told you to leave her out...

24:31.720 --> 24:33.320
Clearly, I'm talking to
the wrong sister.

24:33.430 --> 24:35.387
Yeah, you're all talking
to the wrong sister!

24:35.557 --> 24:38.095
They took the good one into the hills
and slaughtered her!

24:39.853 --> 24:41.344
What was her name?

24:43.232 --> 24:44.518
Willa.

24:44.692 --> 24:46.558
I saw what being law
did to my father.

24:46.735 --> 24:48.567
Whatever you've heard...

24:48.737 --> 24:50.854
getting deputised
is what did him in.

24:51.031 --> 24:52.397
My bosses consider
what's happening

24:52.574 --> 24:54.736
here in Purgatory urgent,
and they will do

24:54.910 --> 24:56.776
whatever it takes
to protect their interests.

24:56.954 --> 24:59.617
Well, good for them.

25:01.625 --> 25:05.369
So, what did you go down
an old dried-up well to get, Earp?

25:06.672 --> 25:08.629
Don't follow me again.

25:08.799 --> 25:11.041
Had it up to here
with surprises.

25:21.228 --> 25:22.514
Willa!

25:22.688 --> 25:25.396
You can't help!
You aren't the heir!

25:25.566 --> 25:27.808
Shotgun won't work.

25:27.985 --> 25:30.568
He needs Wyatt's gun.

25:30.738 --> 25:32.821
No! No!

25:32.990 --> 25:34.276
No! No!

25:34.450 --> 25:36.612
No!

25:36.785 --> 25:38.026
Arggh! Ugh!

25:39.288 --> 25:40.745
Daddy!

25:56.889 --> 25:59.848
Get ready for awesome,
little Cindy.

26:05.898 --> 26:09.733
OK, maybe if I get
a little closer.

26:23.332 --> 26:24.994
Shit!

26:48.982 --> 26:51.144
The black sheep returns.

26:51.318 --> 26:53.059
Jesus.

26:53.237 --> 26:54.944
Waddle along now, Nedley.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.605
Sheriff.

26:56.782 --> 26:58.819
Sheriff Nedley.

26:58.992 --> 27:01.450
You keeping your fluffy
hindquarters clean, or should I

27:01.620 --> 27:03.282
frisk you for old times' sakes?

27:03.455 --> 27:04.662
Wouldn't risk it.

27:04.832 --> 27:06.992
We both know you're one grope away
from a heart attack.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.412
Best stick to internet porn

27:08.585 --> 27:10.480
and the certainty of dying alone,
don't you think?

27:10.504 --> 27:12.791
Why'd you even
come back, Wynonna?

27:12.965 --> 27:15.708
Haven't the people who love you
suffered enough?

27:15.884 --> 27:17.671
Probably.

27:21.765 --> 27:23.381
Waverly?

27:23.559 --> 27:25.141
Champ?

28:02.890 --> 28:04.552
I told you.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.852
I'm ready to help.

28:10.022 --> 28:12.264
What the sweet hell is this?

28:12.441 --> 28:15.525
What, that?
That's just the basics.

28:15.694 --> 28:19.358
Look. Everything I could find
about our family.

28:19.531 --> 28:21.989
You know, Wyatt Earp...

28:22.159 --> 28:23.650
the people he killed.

28:23.827 --> 28:24.658
Look.

28:24.828 --> 28:26.990
You're supposed to be normal,
Waverly.

28:27.164 --> 28:29.907
- You're supposed to be safe!
- Ow!

28:32.294 --> 28:34.832
You know, I scoured
every library,

28:35.005 --> 28:38.373
every archive in the country,
and you know what I never found?

28:39.760 --> 28:42.468
A reason why I can't
break the curse.

28:42.638 --> 28:43.970
Oh, OK.

28:44.139 --> 28:45.971
How about 'cause
your scrapbooking habit

28:46.141 --> 28:47.848
has taken a terrible turn?!

28:48.018 --> 28:49.259
Good one.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.554
Oh, my God!

28:52.731 --> 28:54.472
Is that Wyatt's gun?

28:54.650 --> 28:56.892
You knew where it was
this whole time?!

28:57.069 --> 28:59.436
Yeah, I was 12.
Panicked, I threw it away.

28:59.613 --> 29:02.526
My God, it's beautiful! Ow!

29:02.699 --> 29:04.736
It's old,
it doesn't shoot straight,

29:04.910 --> 29:07.072
and it's worth enough
to buy us both a chrome condo

29:07.246 --> 29:08.703
5,000 miles from here.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.287
This is our home, Wynonna.

29:13.460 --> 29:16.498
I'll protect it,
even if you won't.

29:16.672 --> 29:18.004
You'll die!

29:18.173 --> 29:20.290
Not if I have this!
Look, we can use it...

29:20.467 --> 29:22.675
Ow! We can use it
to kill our enemies!

29:22.844 --> 29:23.844
'Enemies'?!

29:25.472 --> 29:28.636
Waverly, the only person
this gun ever killed

29:28.809 --> 29:30.345
was Daddy...

29:30.519 --> 29:31.805
when I shot him!

29:31.979 --> 29:33.811
You were trying to save him.

29:33.981 --> 29:35.938
- Ah?
- Was an accident.

29:36.108 --> 29:37.440
Yeah.

29:37.609 --> 29:39.145
And it ruined my life.

29:39.319 --> 29:42.062
Not gonna let it ruin yours.

29:44.116 --> 29:45.448
Pack this shit up.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.153
This time,
you're coming with me.

29:47.327 --> 29:49.410
Oh, yeah, run!

29:49.579 --> 29:51.070
You always do.

29:51.248 --> 29:53.956
I'm serious. I'm taking the 6am bus
with or without you.

29:54.126 --> 29:55.833
Right.

29:57.045 --> 30:01.005
You know, of all the things
I've ever wanted to call you...

30:01.174 --> 30:02.881
you're such a coward.

30:04.594 --> 30:06.881
Don't forget 'fraud'.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.726
Mercy me.

30:17.899 --> 30:21.483
Now, is that what I think
it is, little lady?

30:22.946 --> 30:24.653
Let me guess.

30:24.823 --> 30:27.281
Wyatt Earp fan?

30:27.451 --> 30:31.445
Came to see the place
where he drank?

30:31.621 --> 30:35.456
You know what?
Let your freak flag fly free.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.662
Oh, I am free,

30:37.836 --> 30:39.498
free as a bird,

30:39.671 --> 30:42.414
and it's sublime.

30:42.591 --> 30:43.877
OK.

30:44.051 --> 30:48.637
I ain't seen a Buntline Special
in years. May I?

30:50.724 --> 30:52.215
You may not.

30:52.392 --> 30:55.226
I do reckon I know that gun.

30:55.395 --> 30:58.604
Wyatt Earp christened it
'Peacemaker'.

30:58.774 --> 31:00.265
You a collector?

31:00.442 --> 31:04.026
Only of poker chips and hearts.

31:09.743 --> 31:11.735
Engraving his own initials?

31:11.912 --> 31:13.744
Seems rather gauche.

31:13.914 --> 31:16.122
Doc Holliday had it done
to celebrate

31:16.291 --> 31:18.374
his best friend's 50th kill.

31:19.503 --> 31:22.462
Sounds like he was
soft on Wyatt.

31:22.631 --> 31:24.793
'Peacemaker'.

31:24.966 --> 31:26.457
It's pretty rich.

31:26.635 --> 31:28.467
You have any idea
how many people

31:28.637 --> 31:30.299
he killed with that thing?

31:30.472 --> 31:33.135
Are you implying
Wyatt Earp was a hypocrite?

31:33.308 --> 31:36.927
I'm saying
crazy runs in the family.

31:37.104 --> 31:39.346
My apologies.

31:39.523 --> 31:44.143
I did not realise
I was speaking with an Earp.

31:45.362 --> 31:47.069
Bona fide.

31:47.239 --> 31:49.481
Yeah, I just figured...

31:49.658 --> 31:52.275
you were a prostitute.

31:55.038 --> 31:56.995
Prostitutes get paid for it.

31:59.292 --> 32:03.411
He was good at killing,
so they called him 'hero'.

32:03.588 --> 32:06.171
What kind of person wants
to be a gunslinger?

32:06.341 --> 32:09.709
Wyatt Earp wanted
to be a farmer.

32:09.886 --> 32:15.348
30 seconds in the O.K. Corral,
and a gunslinger he was made.

32:15.517 --> 32:19.386
Sometimes, life chooses FOR us.

32:21.231 --> 32:23.018
Your outfit's adorable.

32:31.116 --> 32:33.108
Ma'am.

32:41.918 --> 32:43.250
Gus?

32:43.420 --> 32:45.662
Just came to say goodbye.

32:46.840 --> 32:48.627
Gus?

32:50.260 --> 32:52.252
Gus?

32:54.598 --> 32:56.055
Gus!

32:58.268 --> 33:00.260
Oh, God!

33:01.938 --> 33:05.056
They took Waverly.
You'll fix this.

33:05.233 --> 33:07.941
He said, "Tomorrow..."

33:09.738 --> 33:11.445
"high noon."

33:14.451 --> 33:16.443
Gus?

33:32.177 --> 33:33.509
Supposed to be following me!

33:33.678 --> 33:35.238
Called the number
on your card 50 times.

33:35.347 --> 33:37.464
I heard,
and I'm very sorry about Gus.

33:37.641 --> 33:38.927
She's in intensive care, Dolls.

33:39.100 --> 33:41.217
And I assure you, we are
monitoring the situation.

33:41.394 --> 33:42.225
"Monitoring"?

33:42.395 --> 33:44.478
I need to find
who took my sister.

33:44.648 --> 33:47.356
You know who took your sister.
Officially, coyotes.

33:47.526 --> 33:49.313
And unofficially...

33:49.486 --> 33:51.193
demons.

33:55.367 --> 33:56.983
You said it.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.777
You actually said...

33:59.955 --> 34:01.947
Yes.

34:03.124 --> 34:08.040
They had me committed.
They had me sent away!

34:08.213 --> 34:10.420
We can find them, Dolls.

34:10.590 --> 34:11.876
How?

34:12.050 --> 34:14.884
They can blend in.
They look just like us.

34:16.596 --> 34:18.053
You won't help my sister?

34:18.223 --> 34:21.933
Wynonna... she's already dead.

34:25.522 --> 34:27.514
You don't even know
where they took her.

34:27.690 --> 34:29.853
Sure, I do -
where this whole thing began.

34:31.735 --> 34:33.898
- There gonna be trouble?
- If you don't move.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.313
Shorty, I need the best ride
in your stable.

34:36.491 --> 34:39.279
I got a young black beauty.
Packs a real sweet kick.

34:57.804 --> 34:59.636
Guess you missed your bus.

34:59.806 --> 35:01.342
Yeah, kind of over buses.

35:01.516 --> 35:04.805
- Hanging in there?
- That's terrible!

35:04.978 --> 35:07.345
You pricks are worm food now!

35:07.522 --> 35:09.184
Uh-uh, one more step
and little sis

35:09.357 --> 35:11.314
takes a short drop
into oblivion.

35:11.484 --> 35:13.692
You got a name, revenant?

35:13.862 --> 35:16.229
Well, back in your
great-great-grandpappy's day,

35:16.406 --> 35:19.194
I was known as Malcolm Ramaker,
entrepreneur.

35:19.367 --> 35:20.699
An outlaw.

35:20.869 --> 35:23.703
You know, I remember
the exact moment in 1866

35:23.872 --> 35:25.363
when Wyatt Earp had me hung

35:25.540 --> 35:26.872
for murdering
my business partner.

35:27.042 --> 35:32.254
Too bad the hangman didn't
set the noose very snug.

35:32.422 --> 35:35.506
It took 14 LONG minutes
for me to die.

35:35.675 --> 35:36.961
Yeah, and now you're back.

35:37.135 --> 35:39.593
Yes! And not alone!

35:39.763 --> 35:42.301
Boys!

35:42.474 --> 35:44.682
I know you two.
You're... you're local.

35:44.851 --> 35:47.138
Some of us are.

35:47.312 --> 35:50.271
You see,
when the Earp heir turns 27,

35:50.440 --> 35:52.932
those of us killed
by the last one,

35:53.109 --> 35:54.850
well, we resurrect.

35:55.028 --> 35:57.987
A little more demonic
than the time before, but,

35:58.156 --> 36:02.366
one way or the other,
we all end up in Purgatory.

36:02.535 --> 36:05.278
- Why'd you kill Curtis?
- To lure you back.

36:05.455 --> 36:08.072
Get you to fetch what we needed.

36:08.249 --> 36:10.115
'Peacemaker'.

36:11.795 --> 36:14.378
Please, get us the gun.

36:14.547 --> 36:16.539
No, don't do it.
They'll kill you.

36:16.716 --> 36:18.173
They'll try.

36:18.343 --> 36:20.335
Hey!

36:21.638 --> 36:23.595
OK. OK.

36:23.765 --> 36:26.929
Here goes. Look.

36:27.102 --> 36:29.719
Alright?

36:29.896 --> 36:31.808
All yours. Take the bike too.

36:31.981 --> 36:33.768
John.

36:33.942 --> 36:35.353
- OK?
- Oh, Lordy.

36:35.527 --> 36:38.645
You are the most pathetic heir
we have ever had!

36:38.822 --> 36:40.734
That's me. Now cut her down!

36:40.907 --> 36:42.819
You welch on a deal,
you don't get to ride.

36:42.992 --> 36:45.985
- Somebody, shut her up!
- Carl, will you grab Wynonna?

36:46.162 --> 36:50.031
We're gonna have two dead Earps
for the price of one.

36:50.208 --> 36:52.370
How the hell
do you start this thing?

36:52.544 --> 36:54.877
Ugh! Like this.

37:07.350 --> 37:09.307
- Deep breath, baby girl!
- What?!

37:28.037 --> 37:31.451
- Ahh!
- You think you can best me?!

37:31.624 --> 37:35.618
I am gonna put you
in the ground like it's my job.

37:35.795 --> 37:37.957
'Cause you know what?

37:38.131 --> 37:39.793
I'm starting to think it is.

37:39.966 --> 37:42.879
True, you may have the one gun
that could put me back to hell,

37:43.052 --> 37:45.510
but I'm gonna take
your baby sister with me,

37:45.680 --> 37:47.216
you stupid, crazy bitch!

37:47.390 --> 37:49.473
Wanna know how batshit I am?

37:49.642 --> 37:52.726
Nobody shoots my family but me.

38:07.118 --> 38:08.234
Oh!

38:13.541 --> 38:15.908
You are the heir.

38:16.085 --> 38:19.044
Sealed with a lead kiss.

38:30.558 --> 38:32.390
- You OK, baby girl?
- Yeah.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.267
Oh, Jesus. OK.

38:35.855 --> 38:37.517
Carl!

38:41.027 --> 38:41.858
Stupid Carl!

38:42.028 --> 38:43.940
How do I make this
friggin' work?!

38:45.865 --> 38:47.857
Oh, that's...

38:50.829 --> 38:52.320
What?

38:52.497 --> 38:54.204
You brought backup?

38:54.374 --> 38:57.082
- Oh.
- Yeah.

38:57.252 --> 38:59.585
Hey, you came back for me.

38:59.754 --> 39:01.791
Well, duh!

39:01.965 --> 39:04.002
I'm nuts, remember?

39:04.175 --> 39:05.757
Come on!

39:08.471 --> 39:10.007
Get in!

39:10.181 --> 39:11.717
Couldn't get a bigger truck?

39:11.891 --> 39:13.678
Nope!

39:16.312 --> 39:18.144
- You good?
- Yeah.

39:35.832 --> 39:38.666
Gus is getting discharged
tomorrow.

39:38.835 --> 39:41.999
I put fresh flowers
in her bedroom.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.044
God!

39:46.217 --> 39:49.506
What happened to Wyatt Earp
to make us

39:49.679 --> 39:51.591
deserve this?

39:59.272 --> 40:01.264
You're really staying
this time, aren't you?

40:02.859 --> 40:05.272
That's why they call it a curse.

40:08.448 --> 40:11.862
Well, looks like you're not
the only one sticking around.

40:12.035 --> 40:14.493
Big city, leather loafers.

40:14.662 --> 40:16.028
Douche.

40:16.205 --> 40:18.037
Great butt, though.

40:18.207 --> 40:20.540
Yep.

40:22.128 --> 40:24.962
- Let's talk.
- You're serious?!

40:25.131 --> 40:27.211
That's a first-degree murder charge
of Kiersten Lesko

40:27.342 --> 40:29.403
and not to mention
you're also wanted for questioning

40:29.427 --> 40:31.134
in an open B&E case.

40:31.304 --> 40:34.513
- This is blackmail, you dick!
- This is big government.

40:34.682 --> 40:37.516
You went up against demons
twice and you survived.

40:37.685 --> 40:39.096
We want you.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.637
- Get in line.
- So your first job is simple.

40:41.814 --> 40:43.931
Identify and eradicate
Wyatt Earp's kills.

40:44.108 --> 40:46.316
Revenants. My daddy always
called them 'revenants'.

40:46.486 --> 40:48.899
Before they leave the territory
and have the chance

40:49.072 --> 40:51.735
to slaughter every man, woman
and child in this country.

40:51.908 --> 40:54.321
- They can't leave Purgatory.
- Oh, wait a minute.

40:54.494 --> 40:56.952
Are you telling me
the demons are trapped here?

40:57.997 --> 41:00.580
- It's classified.
- Cute.

41:02.210 --> 41:04.793
Dolls, thank you
for coming for us.

41:04.963 --> 41:07.797
You know, covering us
from the trees.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.802
It's Deputy Marshal Dolls.

41:13.972 --> 41:18.637
And things will go a lot smoother
if you follow my lead.

41:21.646 --> 41:23.137
I highly doubt that.

41:23.314 --> 41:25.146
Oh, and I'm picking my own team.

41:25.316 --> 41:28.559
Got a team... Deputy.

41:30.446 --> 41:33.530
Welcome to
the Black Badge Division.

41:41.582 --> 41:45.075
He's actually
letting you stay here?

41:45.253 --> 41:48.087
Well, it seems that way.

41:48.256 --> 41:51.374
You'd be more comfortable
in town with your own kind.

41:52.552 --> 41:55.795
I reckon I'm the only one
of my kind left.

41:57.724 --> 42:00.216
Some of the boys
are claiming it was you

42:00.393 --> 42:02.555
up in the hills who shot Carl,

42:02.729 --> 42:05.142
provided cover for the heir.

42:05.314 --> 42:06.930
The heir to what?

42:07.108 --> 42:11.148
Wynonna is one thing -
a disgrace to the Earp name.

42:11.320 --> 42:15.735
I'm warning ya,
just keep to the outskirts.

42:15.908 --> 42:17.649
And miss the reunion?

42:17.827 --> 42:20.035
That's not a reunion.

42:20.204 --> 42:22.571
It's a war party.
